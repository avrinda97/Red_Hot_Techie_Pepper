2008-08-22T02:07:00.000Z	The_ManU_212		i want to give my prompt a color and it should be fat, i searched google but tehre are a dozen of complicated tutrials what you can change, but i only want a bit color, can you help?
2008-08-22T02:09:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	start color with \e[1;3xm where x is between 0 and 9, end color with \e[0;9m
2008-08-22T02:10:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	you need to export PS1=somepromptstring in .bashrc
2008-08-22T02:11:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	I mean the command is literally 'export PS1=somepromptstring' where you replace somepromptstring with the string you want for your prompt
2008-08-22T02:14:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	you can find out what your prompt is now with 'echo $PS1'
2008-08-22T02:15:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	To make your prompt light blue and bold do "export PS1='\e[1;36myourpromptstuff\e[0;9m '"
2008-08-22T02:16:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	if you made the change in .bashrc do 'source ~/.bashrc'
2008-08-22T02:17:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	then just run the export command I told you above
2008-08-22T02:17:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	.bashrc is there for you to edit, don't be shy.
2008-08-22T02:19:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	no, export does not write to .bashrc, but yes, you can edit .bashrc and load it with the source command.
2008-08-22T02:21:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	you need to export from within bashrc to make it "permanent" it's not really permanant per-se, but .bashrc is read every time bash starts... and you can edit it anywhere you want. The top is a good choice. Look around and see if PS1 is getting set anywhere in it already and edit it there.
2008-08-22T02:22:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	the \e[1;36m part is the code for bold blue, you'll have to google for terminal color codes if it's not working for you.
2008-08-22T02:24:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	awesome
2008-08-22T02:26:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	yes, gl
2008-08-22T02:30:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	ok
2008-08-22T02:39:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	0;9 is the code for "normal"
2008-08-22T02:39:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	where normal is whatever your terminal thinks normal is
2008-08-22T02:40:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	no, 0 is a specific color, although 99% of the time your terminal thinks that normal == 0
2008-08-22T02:41:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	no, but it generally looks nicer to have a space between the last letter of your prompt and the first letter of your command line
2008-08-22T02:51:00.000Z	qr	The_ManU_212	ahh, my mistake then. Glad you got it working
