2007-09-04T15:27:00.000Z	PriceChild	ward_	using the alternate cd, you can choose a "cli only system"... just like the server one.
2007-09-04T15:28:00.000Z	ward_	PriceChild	are you talking about the alternate xubuntu cd? would the result be as good as with server? or debian as dyrne suggested
2007-09-04T15:29:00.000Z	PriceChild	ward_	the alternate cd for any release, ubuntu/kubuntu/xubuntu has the option of a cli only install, which installs the same cli system regardless of what cd you use. same as with the server cd and choosing no extra services
2007-09-04T15:29:00.000Z	ward_	PriceChild	nice
2007-09-04T15:34:00.000Z	PriceChild	ward_	sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg i guess
