2010-03-30T21:02:00.000Z	Ascavasaion		anyone know why I need ot restart ubuntu 9.10 machine three or four times to get graphics to work?
2010-03-30T21:04:00.000Z	Zenker	Ascavasaion	from previous expierance, if multiple reboots are need to make anything electronic start up correctly , it isnt the configurations or the os or anything like that, its the hardware, but, i suppose just for arguments sake that if u reboot a million times it might reboot differantly one of those times
2010-03-30T21:05:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	Zenker	Only started doing this when I upgraded from 9.04 to 9.10 last night.
2010-03-30T21:06:00.000Z	Zenker	Ascavasaion	are u using options when you restart?
2010-03-30T21:07:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	Zenker	No, nothing fancy.
2010-03-30T21:07:00.000Z	Zenker		ascavasion anything at all?
2010-03-30T21:08:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	Zenker	Nothing... default start up.
2010-03-30T21:08:00.000Z	Zenker		ascavasion, that dosent make any sense 2 me, but i am a noob to linux/ubuntu so i suppose theres something i dont know about rebooting over and over again
2010-03-30T21:09:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	Zenker	Me neither... I think the Karmic upgrade was a screw up.
2010-03-30T21:10:00.000Z	Zenker		ascavasion it could be only coincidental, i had this happen with a mouse the other day, i installed ubuntu studio and all of a sudden my mmb did not rotate the view in blender or seem 2 work at all, it turned out the mouse was faulty, i checked it in a diff sys n it did the same thing
2010-03-30T21:12:00.000Z	Zenker		Ascavasion try this, in power options theres an option to let the monitor sleep, set the time to like 1 min and let it fully sleep and see if it comes back on
2010-03-30T21:12:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	Zenker	Where is that?
2010-03-30T21:13:00.000Z	Zenker		ascavasion system, power managment
2010-03-30T21:13:00.000Z	Zenker		oops system, PREFS, power managment
2010-03-30T21:16:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	Zenker	It never did anything.
2010-03-30T21:17:00.000Z	Zenker		Ascavasion hmm this just makes no sense 2 me, try re-asking/stating your issue, maybe someone else knows whats going on
2010-03-30T21:17:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	Zenker	Okay, the screen came back just fine.
2010-03-30T21:19:00.000Z	Ascavasaion		sigh... how come every time I upgrade Ubuntu everything goes haywire?
2010-03-30T21:20:00.000Z	Zenker		Ascavasion, umm, u can try putting it to sleep, hibernate, do anything to get the monitor/graphics card 2 shut off w/0 actually shutting down the sys. try a few diff things a few times and see if the monitor turns on every time
2010-03-30T21:21:00.000Z	Zenker		ascavasion if in fact the monitor turns back on every time, it just may be some kind of bug that shows up durring boot up
2010-03-30T21:21:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	Zenker	I did the suspend thing
