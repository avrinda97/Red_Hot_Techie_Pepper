2004-11-11T14:33:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	ok, trying it
2004-11-11T14:34:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	yeah
2004-11-11T14:36:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	also, two packages didnt get downloaded, would this have anything to do with it?
2004-11-11T14:37:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	it was doing its usual boot into ubutu and asking if you want to download updates, I believe one of the files was a X file
2004-11-11T14:39:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	yep
2004-11-11T14:39:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	no, ps/2
2004-11-11T14:40:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	yep
2004-11-11T14:41:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	i'm taking it that I should boot in to the recovery mode?
2004-11-11T14:41:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	yeah
2004-11-11T14:44:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	wow, it looks like a lot of packages didnt get downloaded..
2004-11-11T14:55:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	hmmm, its says at boot that it is ignoring the pci device..
2004-11-11T14:56:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	and it still wont boot
2004-11-11T14:56:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	I think so
2004-11-11T15:00:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	00:01.0
2004-11-11T15:03:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	yeah
2004-11-11T15:04:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	hmm, could it also be because the partitioner only made a / partition and a swap partition?
2004-11-11T15:36:00.000Z	Blondeguy	robertj	http://blondeguy.homelinux.net/dmesg
