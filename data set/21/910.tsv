2011-04-23T22:54:00.000Z	ashmew2		My system just restarted on its own...Im doomed :'( ... How can i see what made it restart ?
2011-04-23T22:55:00.000Z	FrozenFire[alt]	ashmew2	Most often, that's an ACPI issue, or a "kernel panic"
2011-04-23T22:55:00.000Z	FrozenFire[alt]	ashmew2	Is your system running really hot?
2011-04-23T22:56:00.000Z	ashmew2	FrozenFire[alt]	: How do i check the temp ? Its been running weird..
2011-04-23T22:56:00.000Z	FrozenFire[alt]	ashmew2	Your hand
2011-04-23T22:57:00.000Z	ashmew2	FrozenFire[alt]	Doesnt seem to be very hot , although i wouldnt know the difference because ive never tried before ... feels to be the same as room temperature
2011-04-23T22:58:00.000Z	FrozenFire[alt]	ashmew2	That looks to be a disk error.
2011-04-23T22:59:00.000Z	ashmew2	FrozenFire[alt]	:  So my HD = screwed ?
2011-04-23T22:59:00.000Z	FrozenFire[alt]	ashmew2	I would run fsck on the disk (System->Administration->Disk Utility->Select the Disk->View SMART data
2011-04-23T23:00:00.000Z	FrozenFire[alt]	ashmew2	Let me know if any of the assessments aren't "Good" or "N/A"
2011-04-23T23:00:00.000Z	ashmew2	FrozenFire[alt]	kk im on it , thx
2011-04-23T23:02:00.000Z	FrozenFire[alt]	ashmew2	"N/A" is fine
2011-04-23T23:04:00.000Z	ashmew2	FrozenFire[alt]	: Airflow Temperature Failed in the past ! Also , current temperature of the disk is 42 degree celsius
2011-04-23T23:04:00.000Z	FrozenFire[alt]	ashmew2	I would recommend checking that all of your system fans are functioning, and that you're not blocking any of the outlets on the case.
2011-04-23T23:05:00.000Z	ashmew2	FrozenFire[alt]	: could a VERY DUSTY Cpu be the issue ?
2011-04-23T23:05:00.000Z	FrozenFire[alt]	ashmew2	Yes
2011-04-23T23:05:00.000Z	ashmew2	FrozenFire[alt]	: So i can clean it up with a blower..hmm?
2011-04-23T23:05:00.000Z	FrozenFire[alt]	ashmew2	If the power supply detects that the fans aren't running, or that the hardware is overheating, it'll perform a hard shutdown of your system via ACPI
2011-04-23T23:06:00.000Z	FrozenFire[alt]	ashmew2	Be sure not to use a vacuum cleaner or anything with water.
2011-04-23T23:06:00.000Z	FrozenFire[alt]	ashmew2	Use compressed air, if possible.
2011-04-23T23:06:00.000Z	ashmew2	FrozenFire[alt]	: k ill check if the fans are running with a flashlight.
