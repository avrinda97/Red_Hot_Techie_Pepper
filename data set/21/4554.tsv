2008-04-03T02:56:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	Maloax	 Heres some reading for you. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=512059. Ill do some more searching see if theres anything about your specific problem. Reason I asked all those questions before was I had a black screen problem same place in one of my installations. What you have is different to mine prob but similar.
