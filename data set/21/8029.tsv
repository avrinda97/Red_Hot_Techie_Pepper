2007-03-18T13:35:00.000Z	bruenig	chemisus	the string is case sensitive
2007-03-18T13:32:00.000Z	bruenig	chemisus	yes using find
2007-03-18T13:33:00.000Z	bruenig	chemisus	what exactly do you have in mind, I can try to make a find command
2007-03-18T13:33:00.000Z	chemisus	bruenig	have 200,000 text files, and need to move the ones that contain a specified string out of it
2007-03-18T13:34:00.000Z	bruenig	chemisus	are there any subdirectories in this directory and if so, do you want to move text files in there too
2007-03-18T13:34:00.000Z	chemisus	bruenig	no
2007-03-18T13:34:00.000Z	chemisus	bruenig	moving them all to one directory
2007-03-18T13:34:00.000Z	bruenig	chemisus	ok then do this, find /path/to/directory -name string -exec mv {} /path/to/new/directory \;
2007-03-18T13:39:00.000Z	chemisus	bruenig	is that searching the name? or the content of the file? cause i need it to search the content of the file
2007-03-18T13:39:00.000Z	bruenig	chemisus	oh it searches the name
2007-04-12T16:59:00.000Z	chemisus	bruenig	i dont see anything on those pages that say which package to search for. and i dont want to convert 20 gigs of mp3's into oggs or flac =/
2007-04-12T16:59:00.000Z	bruenig	chemisus	there is a command in the first link about half a page down, that you can copy to enable loads of codec support
2007-04-12T16:59:00.000Z	chemisus	bruenig	thanks, will check it out
2007-04-12T05:07:00.000Z	chemisus	bruenig	that got videos to work, but not mp3s
2007-04-12T05:08:00.000Z	bruenig	chemisus	should be gstreamer something or other
2007-04-12T05:08:00.000Z	bruenig	chemisus	did all of those things install or were there any things that said it couldn't find the package
2007-04-12T05:08:00.000Z	chemisus	bruenig	they all installed
2007-04-12T05:08:00.000Z	bruenig	chemisus	doesn't play mp3 in anything?
2007-04-12T05:09:00.000Z	chemisus	bruenig	ok, nm, it works... was just odd about the program
2007-04-12T05:09:00.000Z	chemisus	bruenig	thanks for the help
2007-04-12T05:11:00.000Z	chemisus	bruenig	another question =) what should an fstab line look like if we have an ntfs partition on sdb2 that we want to be able to read/write too?
