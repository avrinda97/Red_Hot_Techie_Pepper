2009-04-30T11:18:00.000Z	phillip41		thanks space_cadet
2009-04-30T11:18:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	yep
2009-04-30T11:22:00.000Z	phillip41	space_cadet	is their a way to find out the name of the actual hard drive ubuntu installed on at all
2009-04-30T11:23:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	yes, but i don't know  (sorry)
2009-04-30T11:23:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	fdisk -l should have reported sda or b
2009-04-30T11:23:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	or hda or b
2009-04-30T11:23:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	a is the first disk, b is the second
2009-04-30T11:25:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	which one has linux-native
2009-04-30T11:25:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	sda or b
2009-04-30T11:26:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	sda is your first hard disk, the 1-5 are the partitions
2009-04-30T11:26:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	same thing with b
2009-04-30T11:30:00.000Z	phillip41	space_cadet	you got any sudgestions regarding using vista in a virtual at all it is preinstalled
2009-04-30T11:31:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	you mean run it in a vm from the drive it's installed on?
2009-04-30T11:31:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	good luck if so.
2009-04-30T11:32:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	do you mean to run windows vista that is already installed, within ubuntu?
2009-04-30T11:32:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	or install vista inside ubuntu
2009-04-30T11:32:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	because the first option (afaik) is close to impossible
2009-04-30T11:33:00.000Z	phillip41	space_cadet	i have windows vista installed already on laptop  ubuntu installed on usb hard drive
2009-04-30T11:34:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	if you want to run the already installed instance of vista inside ubuntu... it is next to impossible.   however, if you wish to install a new version of vista inside ubuntu    http://www.virtualbox.org is the way to go
2009-04-30T11:35:00.000Z	space_cadet	phillip41	i would say no. you have to create a virtual hard drive to install an os in a virtual box
