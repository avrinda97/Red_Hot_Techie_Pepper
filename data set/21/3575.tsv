2012-05-29T02:38:00.000Z	pepee	stueng	that's probably because it is not associated/connected
2012-05-29T02:39:00.000Z	pepee	stueng	also, could be related to the LEDs
2012-05-29T02:39:00.000Z	stueng	pepee	iwlist wlan0 scan shows nothing
2012-05-29T02:39:00.000Z	stueng	pepee	this indicator LED needs to be on for the radio to work properly
2012-05-29T02:39:00.000Z	pepee	stueng	ahh, could be rfkill
2012-05-29T02:39:00.000Z	stueng	pepee	rfkill ?
2012-05-29T02:39:00.000Z	pepee	stueng	do you have a function button to enable/disable the wifi?
2012-05-29T02:40:00.000Z	stueng	pepee	its a hardware slider switch, which it turned to the on position
2012-05-29T02:40:00.000Z	stueng	pepee	but in addition to this hardware switch there is also a fn button that can power it off yes
2012-05-29T02:41:00.000Z	pepee	stueng	run this: rfkill list | pastebinit -a anon
2012-05-29T02:41:00.000Z	stueng	pepee	the machine does not have an internet connection to connect to pastebin, I am just waiting for another installation to complete (trying a second laptop of same hardware) and will let you know the outcome
2012-05-29T02:42:00.000Z	pepee	stueng	ah, ok. I probably won't be in this channel
2012-05-29T02:43:00.000Z	stueng	pepee	what is this rfkill ?
2012-05-29T02:43:00.000Z	pepee	stueng	the manpage says "rfkill - tool for enabling and disabling wireless devices"
2012-05-29T02:44:00.000Z	pepee	stueng	it's some device to enable and disable the wifi by hardware and software I think
2012-05-29T02:45:00.000Z	stueng	pepee	seems the command I need to try is rfkill unblock
2012-05-29T02:45:00.000Z	pepee	stueng	yep
2012-05-29T02:45:00.000Z	stueng		when the install is complete :P
2012-05-29T02:48:00.000Z	stueng	pepee	rfkill is not installed
2012-05-29T02:49:00.000Z	pepee	stueng	ahh, I thought it was installed by default
2012-05-29T02:49:00.000Z	stueng	pepee	could be, this is a minimal server install
