2007-12-15T01:22:00.000Z	svladcjelli	n00bie	you may want to look at a web frontend like jinzora
2007-12-15T01:22:00.000Z	svladcjelli	n00bie	mpd+icecast works well, but is complex to setup
2007-12-15T01:23:00.000Z	n00bie	svladcjelli	Flannel :  ok, i think i've read somewhere that icecast and shoutcast works with MOC too...
2007-12-15T01:23:00.000Z	svladcjelli	n00bie	there are tons of console clients for mpd
2007-12-15T01:24:00.000Z	n00bie	svladcjelli	ah, ok... i haven't read anything about mpd... thought maybe it was a client as well, but i guess it's a server?
2007-12-15T01:25:00.000Z	n00bie	svladcjelli	Flannel : thank you for now, i'll read more about the subject(s) on my own
2007-12-15T02:46:00.000Z	svladcjelli	n00bie	it is normal depending on size of disk and filesystem
2007-12-15T02:47:00.000Z	n00bie	svladcjelli	no, i know the two number system :)
2007-12-15T02:48:00.000Z	svladcjelli	n00bie	formatting with a journaled filesystem also takes space
2007-12-15T02:48:00.000Z	svladcjelli	n00bie	what do you have what do you want, what is issue
2007-12-15T02:48:00.000Z	n00bie	svladcjelli	ok, i used gparted and formatted to ext3
2007-12-15T02:49:00.000Z	n00bie	svladcjelli	well, basically i would like to free up the used space
2007-12-15T02:49:00.000Z	svladcjelli	n00bie	how big hard drive, what amount of space is missing... give us details or we cant help
2007-12-15T02:51:00.000Z	n00bie	svladcjelli	ok, sorry... the disc's total capacity is 229.2GB,  used space = 11.8GB
2007-12-15T02:52:00.000Z	svladcjelli	n00bie	ext3 uses approx 5% of space

2007-12-15T02:53:00.000Z	n00bie	svladcjelli	ok, but i remember seeing someone having the exact same problem in here once... and someone gave him a quick fix... can't remember what
2007-12-15T02:53:00.000Z	svladcjelli	n00bie	it is there for a reason...
2007-12-15T02:58:00.000Z	n00bie	svladcjelli	thank you very much, that did it
