2008-05-09T14:15:00.000Z	hellow		How does one probe their usb camera to see what hardware it has / see if someone else has looked into developing a linux driver?
2008-05-09T14:16:00.000Z	fde	hellow	just plug it in, fspot should pop up if you're using gnome.
2008-05-09T14:17:00.000Z	hellow	fde	good to know. that must mean mine can't work since that's not my experience
2008-05-09T14:17:00.000Z	fde	hellow	likely the case unfortunately... although as Boohbah suggests, you can likely mount it manually as a normal USB storage device and see contents
2008-05-09T14:19:00.000Z	fde	hellow	nothing to mess with, it just tells us what the cam actually is, instead of brand names and trade mark names
2008-05-09T14:22:00.000Z	fde	hellow	that's with the cam plugged in? cuz Macrodia is generally the flash card support of most modern systems...
2008-05-09T14:22:00.000Z	fde	hellow	(ie, you can probably plug the memory card of your cam into your computer, and use it like that)
2008-05-09T14:23:00.000Z	hellow	fde	i've been at both of those links actually but thanks
2008-05-09T14:28:00.000Z	fde	hellow	gspca is in the ubuntu kernel already, so that's not your solution... but if you install 'module-assistant' you can do 'm-a a-i <module>'
2008-05-09T14:28:00.000Z	hellow	fde	ah.. i was wondereing why only source was avail
2008-05-09T14:29:00.000Z	fde	hellow	it's a command.
2008-05-09T14:29:00.000Z	hellow	fde	wouldn't have guessed that was a command, lol thanks
2008-05-09T14:30:00.000Z	fde	hellow	it is short hand for 'module-assistant auto-install'... but the creator decided (rightfully) that that's too much to type  :)
2008-05-09T14:35:00.000Z	fde	hellow	no, that tool simple compiles modules against the kernel-headers
2008-05-09T14:36:00.000Z	fde	hellow	heh, we get all sorts of questions here.
2008-05-09T14:42:00.000Z	fde	hellow	module-assistant only works if the maintainer of the module has set up helpers in the package... in the case of gspca-source, they have, however it that was going to help, the module would be loaded already.
2008-05-09T14:43:00.000Z	fde	hellow	'lsmod | grep gspca' with the cam plugged in to see whether it has.
2008-05-09T14:43:00.000Z	fde	hellow	in this case, nothing, as Ubuntu provides it compiled.
2008-05-09T14:43:00.000Z	fde	hellow	then gspca doesn't support your cam ;)
2008-05-09T14:45:00.000Z	hellow	fde	"hellow: gspca is in the ubuntu kernel already, so that's not your solution... but if you install 'module-assistant' you can do 'm-a a-i <module>'" that was the only reason i asked why m-a a-i would help me. i guess i was confused about the necessity of using that for gspca. meh...
2008-05-09T14:45:00.000Z	fde	hellow	see the first statement there.
