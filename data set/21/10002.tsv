2008-08-07T07:36:00.000Z	kane		Two suck out the frimware using fwcutter since i focused on that more
2008-08-07T07:36:00.000Z	kane		The second one
2008-08-07T07:38:00.000Z	nickrud	kane	for my 4311, I simply installed b43-fwcutter (hardy) and then used system->admin->hardware drivers, and enabled the bcm
2008-08-07T07:40:00.000Z	nickrud	kane	why not use the aircrack-ng from the repos?
2008-08-07T07:40:00.000Z	kane	nickrud	i used it to install my broadcom
2008-08-07T07:41:00.000Z	nickrud	kane	sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter . It downloaded the firmware. Then I went to system->admin->hardware and enabled the broadcom there, and rebooted
2008-08-07T07:42:00.000Z	nickrud	kane	yes, just hook it up to a wired connection.
2008-08-07T07:43:00.000Z	nickrud	kane	I'd strongly recommend finding a friends place, it is so much simpler
2008-08-07T07:44:00.000Z	nickrud	kane	that's the one thing that ubuntu can't do, provide that firmware
2008-08-07T07:45:00.000Z	nickrud	kane	wait a bit, I may have some help
2008-08-07T07:45:00.000Z	kane	nickrud	thank you
2008-08-07T07:50:00.000Z	nickrud	kane	http://aphroneo.net/b43.tar.gz , unpack that in /lib/firmware
2008-08-07T07:50:00.000Z	nickrud	kane	this is for the  Broadcom Corporation BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI (rev 01)
2008-08-07T07:51:00.000Z	nickrud	kane	no. Download to your desktop, then do:    cd /lib/firmware && sudo tar xf ~/Desktop/b43.tar.gz
2008-08-07T07:52:00.000Z	nickrud	kane	you need sudo privs to write to that firmware dir
2008-08-07T07:54:00.000Z	nickrud	kane	just do the command I gave. /lib/firmware is not in your home directory, and you must escalate your privileges to write there. See the following factoid:
2008-08-07T07:55:00.000Z	nickrud	kane	write to the directory, /lib/firmware
2008-08-07T07:56:00.000Z	nickrud	kane	no. Download to your desktop, then do:    cd /lib/firmware && sudo tar xf ~/Desktop/b43.tar.gz
2008-08-07T07:57:00.000Z	nickrud	kane	then system->admin->hardware manager
