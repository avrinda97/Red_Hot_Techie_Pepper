2004-09-11T15:38:00.000Z	thom	hypatia	new laptop?
2004-09-11T15:38:00.000Z	hypatia	thom	Yep!
2004-09-11T15:39:00.000Z	hypatia	thom	no, centrino, alas
2004-09-25T12:29:00.000Z	thom	hypatia	it should get mounted under /media ; 
2004-09-25T12:30:00.000Z	hypatia	thom	nup, there's only cdroms under there
2004-09-25T12:30:00.000Z	hypatia	thom	is that bug worthy?
2004-09-25T12:31:00.000Z	thom	hypatia	do you have gnome-volume-manager running?
2004-09-25T12:31:00.000Z	hypatia	thom	as user or root? root I guess
2004-09-25T12:32:00.000Z	hypatia	thom	yep, there it is
2004-09-25T12:37:00.000Z	thom	hypatia	gnome-volume-manager
2004-09-25T12:37:00.000Z	hypatia	thom	not in the list
2004-09-25T12:37:00.000Z	hypatia	thom	gnome-v gives me "gnome-vfs2"
2004-09-25T12:37:00.000Z	hypatia	thom	alternatively I can file a third "cannot file against gnome-volume-manager" bug... or perhaps not
2004-09-25T12:52:00.000Z	hypatia	thom	bug filed
2004-09-26T06:06:00.000Z	hypatia	thom	take today off?
2004-09-26T06:06:00.000Z	thom	hypatia	tempting, but perhaps not
2004-09-26T06:17:00.000Z	thom	hypatia	"corporate teddy bear"?
2004-09-26T12:26:00.000Z	hypatia	thom	what, planet.gnome is the new monster or what?
2004-10-05T15:18:00.000Z	thom	hypatia	it seems that FindAsYouType is broken in most distros, currently :/
2004-10-05T15:23:00.000Z	hypatia	thom	Even Ctrl+G seems to be broken though
