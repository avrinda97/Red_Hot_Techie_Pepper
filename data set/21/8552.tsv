2006-03-17T11:00:00.000Z	rukuartic	solaar	Try ndiswrapper. :)
2006-03-17T11:00:00.000Z	rukuartic	solaar	No, probably does
2006-03-17T11:00:00.000Z	rukuartic	solaar	I'm using a PCI wlan card, but there's difinately stuff out there for usb wlan
2006-03-17T11:01:00.000Z	rukuartic	solaar	Most wlan things need ndiswrapper to get working. Pretty easy to install
2006-03-17T11:03:00.000Z	solaar	rukuartic	do you know of any *nix that supports pci wlan cards natively? it's a dlink card (atheros chipset) if that helps
2006-03-17T11:03:00.000Z	rukuartic	solaar	nope... Ndiswrapper's really easy to install though
2006-03-17T11:03:00.000Z	rukuartic	solaar	didja check the ubuntu wiki? its got a step by step install tutorial

2006-03-17T11:06:00.000Z	rukuartic	solaar	ndiswrapper is something that takes windows drivers, and makes them work in linux
