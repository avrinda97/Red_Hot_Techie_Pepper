2008-08-09T07:47:00.000Z	obx		so my terminal and my terminal font is all squished.
2008-08-09T07:47:00.000Z	obx		and suggestions?
2008-08-09T07:48:00.000Z	crdlb	obx	is the Fixed Width font in Apperance set to a monospace font?
2008-08-09T07:48:00.000Z	obx		for what?
2008-08-09T07:48:00.000Z	obx		all the fonts?
2008-08-09T07:49:00.000Z	crdlb	obx	there is a "Fixed width font" option in gnome's appearance properties, which is what the terminal uses by default. It breaks badly with a non monospaced font
2008-08-09T07:49:00.000Z	obx		i set it to a monospaced one
2008-08-09T07:49:00.000Z	obx		and it's still squashed
2008-08-09T07:50:00.000Z	crdlb	obx	ok, in gnome-terminal, go to edit > current profile, and make sure it's set to use the system font
2008-08-09T07:50:00.000Z	obx		nope still squashed
2008-08-09T07:51:00.000Z	obx		and now the words in here are all cutting off at a certain point
2008-08-09T07:51:00.000Z	crdlb	obx	I don't know; could you take a screenshot and upload it to http://picpaste.com ?
2008-08-09T07:51:00.000Z	obx		yeah 2 seconds

2008-08-09T07:53:00.000Z	crdlb	obx	whoa, what font is it set to?
2008-08-09T07:54:00.000Z	obx		system font
2008-08-09T07:54:00.000Z	obx		it's only the terminal that's doing that
2008-08-09T07:54:00.000Z	obx		cept xchat is now cutting off the last part of any sentence
2008-08-09T07:57:00.000Z	obx		is there anything that i can view recently installed packages?
2008-08-09T07:57:00.000Z	obx		like just a list of recently installed ones
2008-08-09T07:59:00.000Z	crdlb	obx	try setting it to 'DejaVu Sans Mono'
