2005-09-21T11:24:00.000Z	saldb		sorry i thought the bot was part of some system
2005-09-21T11:24:00.000Z	bob2	saldb	the bot really doesn't understand english
2005-09-21T11:24:00.000Z	bob2	saldb	what does linux-laptop.net say about it?
2005-09-21T11:25:00.000Z	bob2	saldb	why dn't you go find out if it's supposed to work or not then?
2005-09-21T11:26:00.000Z	saldb	bob2	the problem is the my wifi adapter has an rf switch. i've read people actually have gotten wifi to work, sadly they don't really explain how
2005-09-21T11:26:00.000Z	bob2	saldb	wifi in general is trivial
2005-09-21T11:26:00.000Z	bob2	saldb	but RF kill switches are hardware specific
2005-09-21T11:28:00.000Z	saldb	bob2	some aren't hardware controlled
2005-09-21T11:29:00.000Z	bob2	saldb	right, but whether or not it's hardware controlled is itslef hardware-specific
2005-09-21T11:29:00.000Z	saldb	bob2	good point
2005-09-21T11:29:00.000Z	saldb	bob2	i'm loading on the ipw2200 driver, it seems to come loaded with 5.10 but i might need to reinstall it
2005-09-21T11:29:00.000Z	bob2	saldb	hardware as in the laptop itself
2005-09-21T11:30:00.000Z	saldb	bob2	the thing is, i'm reading a faq on my exact brand notebook and the author says it just worked randomly/magically
2005-09-21T11:31:00.000Z	bob2	saldb	and the model number is?
2005-09-21T11:31:00.000Z	saldb	bob2	nw8240 .. it's HP Compaq
2005-09-21T11:33:00.000Z	bob2	saldb	someone claism it Just Works on the nc8220, too
2005-09-21T11:35:00.000Z	saldb	bob2	the author claims he recompiled DSDT and somehow that made it work
2005-09-21T11:36:00.000Z	bob2	saldb	it's possible, some laptops do ship with broken dsdts
