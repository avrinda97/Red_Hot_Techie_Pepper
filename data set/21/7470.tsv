2007-04-18T11:02:00.000Z	dc	progek	i have no clue about anything in wine, please elaborate
2007-04-18T11:02:00.000Z	progek	dc	you are trying to run a program with wine?
2007-04-18T11:03:00.000Z	dc	progek	i ran the programs setup.exe in wine, it installed successfully.  i have no clue how to start it though
2007-04-18T11:04:00.000Z	progek	dc	to learn a little more about wine and find your installed programs start by going to its root directory. It's in your home folder but it's hidden. Open a terminal and type cd .wine   you can look around with ls and traverse to find the application. You can also unhide the holders graphically and look around
2007-04-18T11:05:00.000Z	progek		dc if you go to your home folder, press Ctrl+H to unhide
2007-04-18T11:05:00.000Z	progek		look around in .wine
2007-04-18T11:06:00.000Z	dc	progek	got it thanks a lot!

2007-04-18T11:07:00.000Z	dc	progek	itunes
2007-04-18T11:08:00.000Z	progek	dc	hmm.. never used itunes with wine so I cannot help you there. I manage my ipod with other tools
2007-04-18T11:08:00.000Z	dc	progek	i dont even own an ipod, i want to be able to access the shared music from across campus
2007-04-18T11:09:00.000Z	progek	dc	I think the forums have a lot of topics related to wine+itunes. You can most likely find the answer there. I've never used iTunes on wine.
