2011-07-09T00:15:00.000Z	Solto		i have great problems wiht instlling mysql on ubuntu
2011-07-09T00:15:00.000Z	Solto		can anybody help?
2011-07-09T00:16:00.000Z	Polah	Solto	What problems.
2011-07-09T00:17:00.000Z	Solto	Polah	I installed mysql-server and i cannot connect to it. Keep getting ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
2011-07-09T00:17:00.000Z	Polah	Solto	What command are you using to connect?
2011-07-09T00:18:00.000Z	Solto	Polah	mysql -u root
2011-07-09T00:19:00.000Z	Polah	Solto	Use mysql -u root -p, then it'll prompt you for the password
2011-07-09T00:19:00.000Z	Solto	Polah	i tried to set password with: mysql -u root -p password and still getting that error
2011-07-09T00:20:00.000Z	Polah	Solto	No, don't define the password, just do mysql -u <username> -p, it'll prompt you after. Similar to how sudo prompts you
2011-07-09T00:22:00.000Z	Solto	Polah	i tried that also...same error...
2011-07-09T00:23:00.000Z	Solto	Polah	I checked all possible forums for solution...and i can't resolve it
2011-07-09T00:24:00.000Z	Polah	Solto	It keeps saying (Using Password: NO)?
2011-07-09T00:24:00.000Z	Polah	Solto	Even when you do define one?
2011-07-09T00:25:00.000Z	Solto	Polah	just then...when i define ona, says Yes, and right after it says No again
2011-07-09T00:25:00.000Z	Polah	Solto	So when you use mysql -u root -p and then type the password when prompted it says it's using the password but still fails to connect? Are you sure you're entering the correct password, you should've been asked to define the password when installing mysql.
2011-07-09T00:26:00.000Z	Solto	Polah	i wasn't asked for password when i installed mysql.... Is it possible that this is the problem?
2011-07-09T00:27:00.000Z	Polah	Solto	That's strange, I recall when I installed mysql-server it prompted me for a username and password for a master account, as well as asking me to define the hostname.
2011-07-09T00:30:00.000Z	Solto	Polah	i solved it
2011-07-09T00:30:00.000Z	Solto	Polah	it was default pasword 'password'  lol
2011-07-09T00:31:00.000Z	Polah	Solto	Oh. Strange that it never prompted for one during install.
