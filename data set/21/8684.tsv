2008-11-01T08:13:00.000Z	kelvin911		my swap is 4GB
2008-11-01T08:13:00.000Z	kelvin911		i have 2GB ram
2008-11-01T08:15:00.000Z	kelvin911		should i put 2X512MB 533mhz in my computer?  i have 2X1GB 667mhz in it
2008-11-01T08:16:00.000Z	kelvin911		so it is not good?
2008-11-01T08:17:00.000Z	kelvin911		is the speed drop notable?
2008-11-01T08:17:00.000Z	mordof	kelvin911	unlikely you'd notice it
2008-11-01T08:18:00.000Z	mordof	kelvin911	it's noticable only under extreme circumstances (mainly gaming, with really high graphics options.. ) where performance of a ton of operations at once makes a difference
2008-11-01T08:18:00.000Z	mordof	kelvin911	and even then, it won't make alot of difference. it's hardly noticable even at that
2008-11-01T08:19:00.000Z	mordof	kelvin911	i would
2008-11-01T08:20:00.000Z	mordof	kelvin911	even with 2gb of ram, your 4gb swap is more than enough
2008-11-01T08:20:00.000Z	mordof	kelvin911	maybe if you're doing insane 3d scene rendering on large scales you might run into an issue, lol
2008-11-01T08:21:00.000Z	mordof	kelvin911	with 2gb of ran under winxp, i turned off swap completely.. the only time i ever noticed an issue was when i blatently tried to force it to run out
2008-11-01T08:21:00.000Z	mordof	kelvin911	i also run many things at once
2008-11-01T08:22:00.000Z	mordof	kelvin911	you won't ever hit an issue
2008-11-01T08:23:00.000Z	mordof	kelvin911	not with 3gb ram and 4gb swap..
2008-11-01T08:23:00.000Z	mordof	kelvin911	1gb of ram is generally kinda easy to over-do it. i run 2gb at the moment and i have no issues
2008-11-01T08:24:00.000Z	mordof	kelvin911	you run a bit mroe than i tend to regularly, but at times i have enough running to compare with that, and i don't have problems. you shouldn't notice it
2008-11-01T08:26:00.000Z	mordof	kelvin911	taking off to go do the cow level in diablo 2 over lan, bye
2008-11-01T08:26:00.000Z	mordof	kelvin911	should be fine
