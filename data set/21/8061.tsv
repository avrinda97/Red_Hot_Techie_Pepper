2008-05-05T10:27:00.000Z	patbam	ravi	 i get "could not find driver"
2008-05-05T10:27:00.000Z	ravi	patbam	did you install php5-sqlite3?
2008-05-05T10:28:00.000Z	patbam	ravi	php5-sqlite3 is already the newest version.
2008-05-05T10:28:00.000Z	ravi	patbam	and where are you encountering this error?
2008-05-05T10:28:00.000Z	patbam	ravi	 following a tutorial at http://www.litewebsite.com/?c=49
2008-05-05T10:29:00.000Z	patbam	ravi	another php script int he same dir works okay, so i don't think it's permissions

2008-05-05T10:32:00.000Z	patbam	ravi	apparently php won't see sqlite if sqlite2 isn't installed O_o

2008-05-05T10:33:00.000Z	patbam	ravi	 yeah, weird
2008-05-05T10:35:00.000Z	patbam	ravi	seems the missing package was php5-sqlite, but it wasn't installed when i installed php5-sqlite3. wokring now. thanks for hte moral support :)

2008-05-05T10:36:00.000Z	ravi	patbam	this is why I suggest liberal use of wildcards
2008-05-05T10:36:00.000Z	patbam	ravi	with apt-get you mean?
2008-05-05T10:36:00.000Z	ravi	patbam	yep
2008-05-05T10:37:00.000Z	patbam	ravi	ok, will try that in the future. that should really be marked as a dependency though
2008-05-05T10:37:00.000Z	ravi	patbam	yep, should be
2008-05-05T10:38:00.000Z	ravi	patbam	launchpad
