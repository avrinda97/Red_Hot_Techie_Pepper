2007-02-09T12:50:00.000Z	mindstate	quintin	the file is a .avi file , the error is "Error opening/initializing the selected video_out(-vo)device.
2007-02-09T12:51:00.000Z	quintin	mindstate	well the computer is *telling* you what the problem is
2007-02-09T12:51:00.000Z	quintin	mindstate	What vo device are you using?
2007-02-09T12:51:00.000Z	mindstate	quintin	dude i have no idea what would that be? like my gpu?
2007-02-09T12:52:00.000Z	quintin	mindstate	*sigh*.  right click mplayer > preferences > video
2007-02-09T12:52:00.000Z	quintin	mindstate	it's just how mplayer renders the output.   you probably want 'x11v' or whatever.  let me see what mine is
2007-02-09T12:53:00.000Z	mindstate	quintin	yeah i messed with those video preferences
2007-02-09T12:53:00.000Z	mindstate	quintin	but i still get the same result
2007-02-09T12:53:00.000Z	quintin	mindstate	set video out to 'xv'
2007-02-09T12:54:00.000Z	mindstate	quintin	lol that worked :-/
