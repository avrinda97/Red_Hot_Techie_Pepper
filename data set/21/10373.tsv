2005-03-20T15:53:00.000Z	hsoj		Hi, i just installed ubuntu and it can't start X. i get an error saying that no devices were detected and that no screens were found. I have a p4 2.8 in an abit 875p board with a geforce6800 and audigy 2.
2005-03-20T15:54:00.000Z	hsoj		anyone wanna help? heh.
2005-03-20T15:54:00.000Z	hsoj		lol... this is why i love irc.
2005-03-20T15:55:00.000Z	hsoj		isn't hoary not supposed to be out for another month or so?
2005-03-20T15:55:00.000Z	yaaar	hsoj	i'm upgrading to it right now......hopefully
2005-03-20T15:56:00.000Z	yaaar	hsoj	so, this is a brand-new warty install, and X won't load?
2005-03-20T15:56:00.000Z	hsoj	yaaar	yes
2005-03-20T15:57:00.000Z	yaaar	hsoj	if I was doing it, before I tried messing with anything else, I'd go down to http://ubuntuguide.org and follow the directions for "installing the nvidia drivers"
2005-03-20T15:58:00.000Z	yaaar	hsoj	if you've got a problem with your video modules or something that would just neatly sidestep it
2005-03-20T15:58:00.000Z	yaaar	hsoj	yeah, that site is actually really cool; there's all kinds of stuff there that is really handy
2005-03-20T16:04:00.000Z	yaaar	hsoj	yes, unfortunately it *does* look like ubuntuguide.org is down. i've still got it up on my machine, but i can't load it on this other one. odd.
2005-03-20T16:05:00.000Z	yaaar	hsoj	if you really want to try out hoary, just edit /etc/apt/sources.list and change each instance of "warty" to "hoary" ...then run (as root) 'apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade'
2005-03-20T16:06:00.000Z	hsoj	yaaar	is hoary fairly stable?
2005-03-20T16:06:00.000Z	yaaar	hsoj	i have no idea; this upgrade i'm in the middle of will be my first experience.
2005-03-20T16:06:00.000Z	hsoj	yaaar	ok. thanks :)
2005-03-20T16:47:00.000Z	hsoj	yaaar	how's the update goin?
2005-03-20T16:49:00.000Z	yaaar	hsoj	done!
2005-03-20T16:49:00.000Z	hsoj	yaaar	mine just finished as well
2005-03-20T16:49:00.000Z	yaaar	hsoj	seems to be working fine....no major changes except maybe to the layout
2005-03-20T16:50:00.000Z	yaaar	hsoj	now i'm working on installing asterisk, which is why i upgraded
2005-03-20T16:51:00.000Z	hsoj	yaaar	oooh... pbx niftyness :)
