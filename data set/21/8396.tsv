2006-04-14T13:15:00.000Z	rocktoberer		my screen freezes right after ubuntu's login screen
2006-04-14T13:15:00.000Z	rocktoberer		is it a driver problem
2006-04-14T13:15:00.000Z	rocktoberer		possibly?
2006-04-14T13:16:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	rocktoberer	does the screen goes to blank?
2006-04-14T13:16:00.000Z	rocktoberer		evga 133-k8-nf41
2006-04-14T13:18:00.000Z	rocktoberer		i cant make out anything on the screen but i am still able to move the cursor around
2006-04-14T13:19:00.000Z	rocktoberer		its my first install
2006-04-14T13:19:00.000Z	rocktoberer		i put it on the hard drive of my old computer
2006-04-14T13:20:00.000Z	rocktoberer		the same thing happens using a ubuntu live cd
2006-04-14T13:20:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	rocktoberer	Does the "_" cursor just stays and not running?
2006-04-14T13:23:00.000Z	rocktoberer		the mouse cursor would move around
2006-04-14T13:23:00.000Z	rocktoberer		the last few times i tried booting into ubuntu it wouldnt even load the gui
2006-04-14T13:23:00.000Z	rocktoberer		it just sent me into the text version i believe
2006-04-14T13:24:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	rocktoberer	no, when you use Live CD and running till it's stops (goes into blank screen and "_" stays)?
2006-04-14T13:25:00.000Z	rocktoberer		i believe so
2006-04-14T13:25:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	rocktoberer	aha, that's memory problem, and you can use memtest86 leave it on for 24 hours till you get back to see any errors..
2006-04-14T13:30:00.000Z	rocktoberer	PwcrLinux	if it is a memory problem would windows be working well?
2006-04-14T13:31:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	rocktoberer	you need to run a memtest86 in the grub boot menu and press F1 to look for memtest86 (Live CD alway have a memtest86)
2006-04-14T13:33:00.000Z	rocktoberer		ill go do that
2006-04-14T13:33:00.000Z	rocktoberer		thank you
2006-04-14T13:33:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	rocktoberer	if the memtest86 frozed and shut off and do reseat a memory module..
