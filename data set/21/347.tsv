2012-02-19T02:43:00.000Z	Fleg_		Hi All! I have a problem turning off my PC. Seem the apm turn off doesn't work. HDD goes to sleep but the power does not go off. The problem is only on ubuntu. I've tried to boot with various options (apci=off and so on). It doesn't help. Please help it's really frustrating...
2012-02-19T02:44:00.000Z	dipix	Fleg_	what do you use to turn it off?
2012-02-19T02:44:00.000Z	Fleg_	dipix	several… poweroff, kde "turn off"...
2012-02-19T02:45:00.000Z	dipix	Fleg_	did you try through  the GUI
2012-02-19T02:46:00.000Z	Fleg_	dipix	yes. and also sudo poweroff over ssh.
2012-02-19T02:46:00.000Z	dipix	Fleg_	are you using Kubuntu?
2012-02-19T02:46:00.000Z	Fleg_	dipix	yes.
2012-02-19T02:47:00.000Z	dipix	Fleg_	oooo, I had a very bad experience with  it, I don't mean to make your situation worse.
2012-02-19T02:48:00.000Z	Fleg_	dipix	you mean kubuntu?
2012-02-19T02:48:00.000Z	dipix	Fleg_	yes, if you can, stay away from it
2012-02-19T02:48:00.000Z	Fleg_	dipix	are there alternatives with KDE?
2012-02-19T02:49:00.000Z	Fleg_	dipix	BTW: mint 12 have the same issue.
2012-02-19T02:50:00.000Z	dipix	Fleg_	I use Ubuntu, Fedora and BT, the rest are on my vmware for testing, mint was ok, are you looking for a lightweight version?
2012-02-19T02:51:00.000Z	Fleg_	dipix	I'm looking for a stable version with KDE.
2012-02-19T02:51:00.000Z	Fleg_	dipix	this is for my girlfriend. I use gentoo myself.
2012-02-19T02:52:00.000Z	dipix	Fleg_	give "Lubuntu" a try, but that's LXDE. why not ubuntu? unless you have very old hardware.
2012-02-19T02:52:00.000Z	Fleg_	dipix	I tried Sabayon. It runs very good on this PC and turns off the power after shutdown but it's gentoo like. This means update -> recompile things...
2012-02-19T02:53:00.000Z	Fleg_	dipix	ubuntu uses Gnome and who worked with kde is a lot different….
2012-02-19T02:54:00.000Z	dipix	Fleg_	if you don't mind switching to "yum/rpm", try Fedora KDE.
2012-02-19T02:57:00.000Z	Fleg_	dipix	that would be an alternative. Though it is not always up to date or is it my wrong information...
2012-02-19T02:59:00.000Z	dipix	Fleg_	I have no idea, I don't really like Debian
