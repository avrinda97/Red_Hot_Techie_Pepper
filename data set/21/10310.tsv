2005-04-06T15:46:00.000Z	dockane		hi all ... just have istalled ubuntu on my thinpad t21. my first question is how do i set up a higher desktop resolution ? ubuntu only offers me 640x480
2005-04-06T15:48:00.000Z	claint	dockane	: i had the same problem yesterday on my laptop after i had done an install
2005-04-06T15:48:00.000Z	claint	dockane	: what is the graphics card, do you know?
2005-04-06T15:49:00.000Z	claint	dockane	: well, i don
2005-04-06T15:50:00.000Z	dockane	claint	what do you mean with  i don ? (sorry for my poor english)
2005-04-06T15:50:00.000Z	claint	dockane	: well, i don't know what exatly caused my prblem. i had a beackup of my prior XF86Config which worked and i used that. the difference was a vertical and horizontal sync difference between the config files
2005-04-06T15:50:00.000Z	claint	dockane	: i had pressed return before completing what i was writing.
2005-04-06T15:51:00.000Z	claint	dockane	: laptop keyboards kinna small you know...
2005-04-06T15:51:00.000Z	dockane	claint	i see : no problem. so is it all about the xorg.conf in /etc/x11/ ?
2005-04-06T15:52:00.000Z	claint	dockane	: mine was warty though, so it was XF86Config-4 for me. but as i have said, i don't know what caused it, it happened after the upgrade.
2005-04-06T15:52:00.000Z	claint	dockane	: and luckily i had a backup, which was done by the nvidia driver installation.
2005-04-06T15:55:00.000Z	claint	dockane	: the resolutions should be in your xorg.conf.
2005-04-06T15:56:00.000Z	claint	dockane	: see if you got 1024x768 there.
2005-04-06T15:56:00.000Z	dockane	claint	yes they should. and the strange thing everything there is about 1024-768
2005-04-06T15:57:00.000Z	claint	dockane	: that is exactly what happened to me as well.
2005-04-06T15:57:00.000Z	claint	dockane	: my resolutions in there were all high, but it wasnt giving me anything other than 640x480
2005-04-06T15:57:00.000Z	claint	dockane	hold on.
2005-04-06T15:57:00.000Z	dockane	claint	maybe its because of the entry "standard monitor/display" ?
2005-04-06T15:58:00.000Z	claint	dockane	this is the only diff i got between configs that worked and that didnt. mind that my config file is not xorg.conf, but it might help.
2005-04-06T15:59:00.000Z	claint	dockane	: the one that works has:
2005-04-06T15:59:00.000Z	claint	dockane	that is the output of diff so disregard the > < chars
