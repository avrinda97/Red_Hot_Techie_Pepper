2009-11-09T23:06:00.000Z	Xyzumi	tLoFP	need to remove ubuntu 9.04
2009-11-09T23:06:00.000Z	tLoFP	Xyzumi	id keep Grub
2009-11-09T23:06:00.000Z	Xyzumi	tLoFP	just want to keep windows XP
2009-11-09T23:06:00.000Z	tLoFP	Xyzumi	boot live delete your partition, edit grub as appropriate
2009-11-09T23:07:00.000Z	tLoFP	Xyzumi	in that case you must have windows XP recreate a boot loader
2009-11-09T23:07:00.000Z	tLoFP	Xyzumi	this is not easy as windows was never about being nice in terms of coexisting with OSs
2009-11-09T23:07:00.000Z	tLoFP	Xyzumi	but you should be able to repair it, if no bootloader is present useing your XP CD
2009-11-09T23:10:00.000Z	Xyzumi	tLoFP	can i delete ubuntu and keep GRUB??
2009-11-09T23:10:00.000Z	tLoFP	Xyzumi	where did you install grub?
2009-11-09T23:10:00.000Z	Xyzumi	tLoFP	dont know, it was jaunty auto
2009-11-09T23:10:00.000Z	tLoFP	Xyzumi	just a warning, Windows found a security vulnerability for XP that they DO NOT plan on fixing
2009-11-09T23:11:00.000Z	Xyzumi	tLoFP	I use ubuntu, in my laptop, thats for a friend that didnt like

2009-11-09T23:13:00.000Z	tLoFP	Xyzumi	I assume grub is installed in the MBR
2009-11-09T23:13:00.000Z	tLoFP	Xyzumi	which probably means you overwrote windows boot loader
2009-11-09T23:13:00.000Z	Xyzumi	tLoFP	yes thats right
2009-11-09T23:15:00.000Z	Xyzumi	tLoFP	thanks
