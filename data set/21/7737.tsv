2009-06-06T06:30:00.000Z	yvonne		and i need help installing it...
2009-06-06T06:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	you got to be careful with wireless devices,  they don't all just work on Linux
2009-06-06T06:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	some can be tricky to set up, and others  you  might not be able to get working at all,  unless ndiswrapper works which allows the Windows driver to work
2009-06-06T06:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	sadly not all hardware manufactures support Linux properly or at all
2009-06-06T06:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	looking at the link the bot gave, that's a start
2009-06-06T06:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	 probably not
2009-06-06T06:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	to get that wireless working you basically have 3 options.   1.   figure out how to get it working natively if it's possible should be   2.  use Ndiswrapper which I mentioned earlier  3.  try another Linux distro where you may  have more luck with wireless, one comes to mind
2009-06-06T06:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	can you get a WIndows driver, and the .inf file?
2009-06-06T06:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	do you know what the repo is by the way?
2009-06-06T06:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	yes that's what I thought
2009-06-06T06:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	new to Ubuntu? ended up with it for some reason, but not that technical when it comes to computers? am I correct?
2009-06-06T06:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	it is, but  sometimes people have to configure wireless
2009-06-06T06:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	you don't need to know all the commands
2009-06-06T06:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	infact you hardly need to know any commands,  just  know what commands to put in when it comes to say configuring the wireless
2009-06-06T06:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	you can get it working
2009-06-06T06:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	I expect,  just going to have to use the windows driver  with a program called ndiswrapper
2009-06-06T07:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	with Ndiswraper you will use the  inf file from the Windows driver
2009-06-06T07:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	so your wireless works good stuff :)
2009-06-06T07:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	oh
2009-06-06T07:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yvonne	is gone now, and  cabrey did a good job at helping her
