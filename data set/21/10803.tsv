2004-11-07T10:35:00.000Z	kensai		?
2004-11-07T10:35:00.000Z	Mithrandir	kensai	/me <foo>
2004-11-07T10:36:00.000Z	Mithrandir	kensai	whatever you do.
2004-11-07T10:36:00.000Z	Mithrandir	kensai	so /me notes he doesn't know how to do this
2004-11-07T10:38:00.000Z	Mithrandir	kensai	it's the obvious solution, at least: get a faster computer. :)
2004-11-07T10:44:00.000Z	Mithrandir	kensai	yes
2004-11-15T15:01:00.000Z	Mithrandir	kensai	yes, it's fairly easy as well; the trick is getting the bootloader to install
2004-11-15T15:02:00.000Z	kensai	Mithrandir	any howto?
2004-11-15T15:03:00.000Z	Mithrandir	kensai	for copying the files?  mount the new hd somewhere and run cp -ax / /newplace, making sure to repeat for each of your partitions
2004-11-15T15:04:00.000Z	Mithrandir	kensai	if you don't feel comfortable mucking about in a terminal, I'd recommend installing onto the new drive, then copying your user data over afterwards.
2004-11-15T15:05:00.000Z	kensai	Mithrandir	installing in my other HDD and copying files might be the best
2004-11-18T12:40:00.000Z	Mithrandir	kensai	not yet, I think.
