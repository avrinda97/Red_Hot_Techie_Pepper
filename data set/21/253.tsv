2012-06-29T07:25:00.000Z	L3top		I do not understand his flash issue. I cannot reproduce it. He does not error on it. nvidia-173 is broken in precise, but through downgrading xorg, we got it running... still no flash.  I do not have an explaination or understanding of the root problem. Either the 2 day old flash player has broken nouvau AND all legacy nvidia drivers... or... something is brokedybroke that I cannot find on their machine. I am spent.
2012-06-29T07:27:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	well flash is 99% perfect here on pangolin.. I get a "blue" skin tone on *certain (not all) youtube videos.. (somebody else mentioned it too here last week)
2012-06-29T07:27:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	with the 'color' hint issue? because that's the error i get
2012-07-07T08:21:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	i think you mean the other one
2012-07-07T08:21:00.000Z	L3top	jagginess	I do not understand
2012-07-12T09:21:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	says who?
2012-07-12T09:22:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	then why did they partner to store flash on canonical's third party repository?
2012-07-12T09:22:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	you've got a link?
2012-07-12T09:23:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	in a way it's wrong because flash comes with chrome, so i'll just switch to using chrome if i cant get the latest flash plugin for firefox
2012-07-12T09:24:00.000Z	L3top	jagginess	I am in #ubuntu-offtopic if you want to continue
2012-07-18T10:10:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	he's trying to get hdmi to work
2012-07-18T10:26:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	ouch another module can load that ati hdmi..
2012-09-22T06:54:00.000Z	L3top	jagginess	It appears as though he originally installed ubuntu on an ntfs partition, he then ran fixmbr or something crushing grub... we are just trying to find his install so as to reinstall/update grub2
2012-09-22T06:55:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	there's no linux partitions listed of type 83.. only a swap, and the rest ntfs
2012-09-22T06:55:00.000Z	L3top	jagginess	It appears as though he originally installed ubuntu on an ntfs partition
2012-09-22T06:56:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	you mean he's using wubi?
2012-09-22T06:56:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	if what's the case?
2012-09-22T06:57:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	no.. i'm asking if he used wubi.. that would be a loopback file on ntfs
2012-09-22T06:57:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	and by default it's ext3 within the loopback..
2012-09-22T06:58:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	you sure he's not using wubi?
2012-09-22T07:21:00.000Z	jagginess	L3top	it's a usb drive
