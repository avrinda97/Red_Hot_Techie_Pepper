2012-05-27T06:17:00.000Z	chuuicv		hi, i can't get a fresh install of ubuntu on my computer
2012-05-27T06:17:00.000Z	chuuicv		I have to use 10.04. I've used Unetbootin, and it throws error 2 errors when I try to boot from usb
2012-05-27T06:17:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	chuuicv	what is the error in a pastebin
2012-05-27T06:18:00.000Z	chuuicv		I don't know. I'd have to try and reformat again. Wilee, it throws "Error 2" errors throughout every step of the install process
2012-05-27T06:19:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	chuuicv	did you test the md5sum of the ISO, and did you reformat the usb that may need to be done.
2012-05-27T06:19:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		!md5sum
2012-05-27T06:20:00.000Z	chuuicv	wilee-nilee	Specifically, it asks what language, I choose english, "ERROR 2: Some crap. Do you want to cancel, continue, retry? If you continue it could screw things up. Retrying doesn't work duh. And if you cancel, well, I'll just close the entire installer.""
2012-05-27T06:20:00.000Z	chuuicv		So i continue and it throws the same error for every single thing it tries to install
2012-05-27T06:20:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	chuuicv	did you test the md5sum of the ISO, and did you reformat the usb that may need to be done.
2012-05-27T06:21:00.000Z	chuuicv	wilee-nilee	Would UNetbootin give me an invalid checksum?
2012-05-27T06:21:00.000Z	chuuicv		Where is the desktop folder on Ubuntu?
2012-05-27T06:21:00.000Z	chuuicv		Can't find it in file system
2012-05-27T06:21:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	chuuicv	I'm not sure about checking a thumb check the link the bot gives.
2012-05-27T06:21:00.000Z	chuuicv		ty
2012-05-27T06:22:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	chuuicv	I have feeling you are not sure what a check sum is not sure realy.,
2012-05-27T06:23:00.000Z	chuuicv	wilee-nilee	Lemme checksum it, although I'm 99% sure it's fine
2012-05-27T06:24:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	chuuicv	something is up unetbootin is fairly reliable would you like another usb loader to try? Ubuntu has one itself if you are using a ubuntu OS to load the thumb.
2012-05-27T06:25:00.000Z	chuuicv	wilee-nilee	The usb-creator? I tried it too with different, yet still failing results.
2012-05-27T06:25:00.000Z	chuuicv	wilee-nilee	I already have Ubuntu 10.04 on here, I'm just trying to reformat with a fresh copy of it. What steps would you take exactly?
2012-05-27T06:26:00.000Z	chuuicv	wilee-nilee	Btw, checksum was fine
2012-05-27T06:27:00.000Z	chuuicv	wilee-nilee	brb, trying again
