2012-06-17T14:37:00.000Z	Larcyn		Could someone help me with ProFTPD?
2012-06-17T14:38:00.000Z	Larcyn		Everything is working properly, but I can't connect with filezilla
2012-06-17T14:38:00.000Z	SunTsu	Larcyn	how would we know withould knowing your problem?
2012-06-17T14:38:00.000Z	Larcyn		I can connect through any web FTP, but not filezilla
2012-06-17T14:39:00.000Z	Larcyn		does anyone know what my problem can be?
2012-06-17T14:40:00.000Z	Larcyn		I can't connect to Filezilla with my problems
2012-06-17T14:40:00.000Z	Larcyn		But I can connect to other FTP clients with the same FTP information
2012-06-17T14:40:00.000Z	SunTsu	Larcyn	Not without more information about it. Could be a problem with filezilla's config, could be a proftpd problem - does ftp work with other sites?
2012-06-17T14:41:00.000Z	Larcyn	SunTsu	Yes, my FTP information works with other clients, but not with filezilla. that's the problem
2012-06-17T14:41:00.000Z	SunTsu	Larcyn	that's not what I asked. Does filezilla work with a different ftp site?
2012-06-17T14:42:00.000Z	Larcyn	SunTsu	Yes it does.
2012-06-17T14:42:00.000Z	Larcyn	SunTsu	I've tested multiple ftp sites
2012-06-17T14:42:00.000Z	Larcyn	SunTsu	And they all works nice
2012-06-17T14:43:00.000Z	SunTsu	Larcyn	did you look into ProFTP's log files to see what's going wrong?
2012-06-17T14:43:00.000Z	SunTsu	Larcyn	and: What exactly do you mean by saying "doesn't work" - what exactly is happening?
2012-06-17T14:44:00.000Z	Larcyn	SunTsu	My output from the connection is: ftp failed to retrieve directory listing
2012-06-17T14:44:00.000Z	Larcyn	SunTsu	And I only get that error when I use filezilla, other clients isn't outputting that error
2012-06-17T14:44:00.000Z	SunTsu	Larcyn	sounds like an active/passive ftp issue. Did you setup filezilla for passive ftp?
2012-06-17T14:45:00.000Z	Larcyn	SunTsu	Nope, I don't know how to do that
2012-06-17T14:45:00.000Z	SunTsu	Larcyn	I don't neither, filezilla's docs should know
2012-06-17T14:46:00.000Z	Larcyn	SunTsu	Ok, thank you, i'm going to read them :)
