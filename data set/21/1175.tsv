2011-01-12T22:06:00.000Z	fizy[laptop]	sacarlson	just connection priority
2011-01-12T22:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	fizy[laptop]	you can set the power level of output from the access point to prevent the user to see one as stronger and also set threshold on the recieve side of accesspoints
2011-01-12T22:08:00.000Z	fizy[laptop]	sacarlson	so there is no direct way to say 'connect to this one if both are availible'?
2011-01-12T22:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	fizy[laptop]	that will make them normaly connect to the stronger
2011-01-12T22:09:00.000Z	fizy[laptop]	sacarlson	figures. it autoconnects to the older, slower, worse one
2011-01-12T22:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	fizy[laptop]	yes you can do that also, you can select the accesspoint from the cleint side even if the network name is the same
2011-01-12T22:11:00.000Z	fizy[laptop]	sacarlson	the 2 essids are different. i just want to have it auto connect to the new one, and if god forbid something were to happen with the new one, as sometimes does, be able to connect to the old one by itself
2011-01-12T22:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	fizy[laptop]	I see auto redundent,  you would require to right a simple bash script to do that
2011-01-12T22:13:00.000Z	fizy[laptop]	sacarlson	poo. ill just delete the old one from the network list then
2011-01-12T22:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	fizy[laptop]	but maybe something exists that would also do that
2011-01-12T22:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	fizy[laptop]	I do something similar with two redundent ISP providers if one fails it auto switches to the other, it simply tests the internet every 5 mins
2011-01-12T22:15:00.000Z	fizy[laptop]	sacarlson	i just want it to connect to one network, and if that fails, connect to the other
2011-01-12T22:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	fizy[laptop]	well same concept,  I just test a ping to google to verify conectivity
2011-01-12T22:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	fizy[laptop]	well I do have a default ISP that if both fails it waits for that one
2011-01-12T22:18:00.000Z	fizy[laptop]	sacarlson	i think that newer networks take priority. ill delete both, connect to the old one, then the new one, reboot, and see which one it connects to
2011-01-12T22:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	fizy[laptop]	my customers don't like it if networks fails for more than 5 min and I'm to lazy to check it so that's what computers are for
2011-01-12T22:24:00.000Z	fizy[laptop]	sacarlson	still connected to the old one. oh well. ill just delete the old one
2012-06-08T22:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	fizy[laptop]	I don't think you need 2 swap partitions
2012-06-08T22:38:00.000Z	fizy[laptop]	sacarlson	i know. but i didnt when i made that mistake. oh well, no harm done
2012-06-08T22:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	fizy[laptop]	well at the size of a swap partition you could make it a /boot partition but more trouble than it's worth I would think for little gain
