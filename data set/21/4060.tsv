2008-07-26T21:59:00.000Z	zerogate		i am having problems with nvidia restricted drivers. everytime i enable them my ubuntu hardy launches in low graphics mode and says my gpu couldn't be detected. anybody?
2008-07-26T22:00:00.000Z	wols	zerogate	lspci and dpkg -l |grep nvidia    pastebin the output of those commands
2008-07-26T22:03:00.000Z	zerogate	wols	http://pastebin.com/m68eb852b
2008-07-26T22:08:00.000Z	zerogate	wols	does my pastebin say something useful?
2008-07-26T22:09:00.000Z	wols	zerogate	looks fine
2008-07-26T22:09:00.000Z	wols	zerogate	check Xorg.0.log when nvidia drivers are loaded for errors or messages
2008-07-26T22:09:00.000Z	wols	zerogate	tho, what ubuntu version do you run? 169.x of nvidia drivers probably don't support 8600 chips
2008-07-26T22:10:00.000Z	zerogate	wols	hardy
2008-07-26T22:12:00.000Z	wols	zerogate	you used envy to install. no support here
2008-07-26T22:12:00.000Z	wols	zerogate	the driver is wrong and not the hardy drivers
2008-07-26T22:14:00.000Z	zerogate	wols	envy was my last chance since neither apt-get nvidia-glx-new nor installing the binaries worked
2008-07-26T22:15:00.000Z	wols	zerogate	we don't care. envy is not supported end of story. ask the envy folks
2008-07-26T22:20:00.000Z	zerogate	wols	which driver version should work?
2008-07-26T22:21:00.000Z	wols	zerogate	the one in hardy
2008-07-26T22:42:00.000Z	zerogate	wols	works now with the 169.12 drivers...
2008-07-26T22:42:00.000Z	zerogate	wols	which commands did you tell me to type in? i forgot (one was lspci and the other one?)
2008-07-26T22:43:00.000Z	wols	zerogate	I doN't do envy support. neither does this channel. have a nice day
2008-07-26T22:43:00.000Z	zerogate	wols	i'm not talking about envy
2008-07-26T22:45:00.000Z	zerogate	wols	you seem to get aggressive as soon as you get confronted with envy. why is this?
2008-07-26T22:45:00.000Z	wols	zerogate	it breaks your ubuntu. we cannot support that
2008-07-26T22:45:00.000Z	wols	zerogate	it was another factoid, changed now
