2009-08-26T07:49:00.000Z	MenZa	aj_444	Alright - my bad. Are you in Ubuntu right now?
2009-08-26T07:50:00.000Z	aj_444	MenZa	I'm on the machine that has ubuntu, but its a dual boot, so I'm using the XP half. I have a desktop that I could switch to if need be though.
2009-08-26T07:50:00.000Z	MenZa	aj_444	No, you can easily use Windows for what you want. First, go to http://packages.ubuntu.com in your browser and find the packages you need.
2009-08-26T07:51:00.000Z	aj_444	MenZa	if only I knew.
2009-08-26T07:51:00.000Z	MenZa	aj_444	Right, I'm afraid I didn't follow your issue before. Try looking at arvind_khadri's post above.
2009-08-26T07:53:00.000Z	aj_444	MenZa	I checked the support page to see if my netbook was compatible. It said I needed to download a backport deb file
2009-08-26T07:53:00.000Z	MenZa	aj_444	Which netbook is this?
2009-08-26T07:53:00.000Z	aj_444	MenZa	the dreaded asus eee pc 1005ha.
2009-08-26T07:53:00.000Z	MenZa	aj_444	oh dear. Let me have a look around. I'll return to you in a minute.
2009-08-26T07:56:00.000Z	MenZa	aj_444	The post appears to be what you want, no doubt about it. If you can access an Internet-enabled computer while running these things on your Ubuntu install, I could guide you through it, if you'd like?
2009-08-26T07:56:00.000Z	aj_444	MenZa	sure thing. I just need to switch to the desktop so I'll be back in a few.
2009-08-26T07:57:00.000Z	MenZa	aj_444	sure. I'll be waiting.
2009-08-26T10:02:00.000Z	aj_444	MenZa	Would you by any chance know how to remove the GRUB Boot Loader?
2009-08-26T10:02:00.000Z	MenZa	aj_444	Yes, it does require you to use your Windows CD to set the Windows bootloader to boot instead.
2009-08-26T10:02:00.000Z	aj_444	MenZa	The netbook doesn't ship with a windows cd I don't think.
2009-08-26T10:03:00.000Z	MenZa	aj_444	hmm, in that case, I have no clue
2009-08-26T10:03:00.000Z	aj_444	MenZa	I want to just delete that ubuntu partition. It came with GRUB though and I heard that won't just boot windows
2009-08-26T10:38:00.000Z	aj_444	MenZa	So, I'm going to install 9.1. Do I need to delete the partition and make a new one for 9.1 or will it automatically replace 9.04?
2009-08-26T10:39:00.000Z	MenZa	aj_444	Tell it to replace it when you install it.
2009-08-26T10:39:00.000Z	aj_444	MenZa	Okay. Sounds good.
