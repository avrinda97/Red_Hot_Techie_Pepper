2008-05-01T17:53:00.000Z	ph8		hi everyone, i've just upgraded gutsy -> hardy and as is typical with these things my entire X config has gone to pot. I was about to try and reconfigure my dual screen nvidia setup again and i was wondering if i can now do  this through a setup screen? rather than all the xorg.conf tweaking that's been needed in the past
2008-05-01T17:55:00.000Z	ph8		i'll keep tweaking thanks
2008-05-01T17:55:00.000Z	ph8		are there any plans for dual head support in actual menus?
2008-05-01T17:55:00.000Z	ph8		it really puts ubuntu behind gaydows
2008-05-01T17:55:00.000Z	bazhang	ph8	please dont use that a derogatory term thanks
2008-05-07T17:47:00.000Z	bazhang	ph8	please pastebin the out put of lspci
2008-05-07T17:49:00.000Z	bazhang	ph8	you tried the madwifi with that? it say s in ubuntu 5006, but in fact may be the 5007-->this is a dual boot?

2008-11-10T17:15:00.000Z	bazhang	ph8	try the live cd first

2008-11-10T17:15:00.000Z	bazhang	ph8	certainly some; just need to check if they apply to you
2008-11-10T17:16:00.000Z	ph8	bazhang	 Is the best image for me to download the one from cdimage.ubuntu.com - or the one from the website do you reckon?
2008-11-10T17:16:00.000Z	bazhang	ph8	either one or the torrent will work fine
