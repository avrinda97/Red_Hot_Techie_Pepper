2008-01-27T00:25:00.000Z	MaNRo		Could anyone know the proper steps to install the lastest nvidia drivers on Gutsy?
2008-01-27T00:26:00.000Z	MaNRo		thanks ubotu...I've read that, but I want to try the lastest drivers
2008-01-27T00:26:00.000Z	MaNRo		...an truly want to learn how to do it "by hand" :)
2008-01-27T00:27:00.000Z	danand	MaNRo	- you may be able to download from nVidia direct - I did this with my debian box
2008-01-27T00:28:00.000Z	MaNRo		sure danand, I did it, and run it, but when I reboot I have no graphic interface anymore
2008-01-27T00:28:00.000Z	danand	MaNRo	- the package you get needs to compile a module for your kernel - so you might need kernel headers / source etc
2008-01-27T00:29:00.000Z	danand		manro - ignore last then - i type too slow!!
2008-01-27T00:29:00.000Z	MaNRo		no problem, thanks :D
2008-01-27T00:29:00.000Z	MaNRo		any suggestion?
2008-01-27T00:29:00.000Z	MaNRo		any other! :D
2008-01-27T00:30:00.000Z	danand		manro - have you looked in your x log for errors??
2008-01-27T00:30:00.000Z	danand	MaNRo	 - /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2008-01-27T00:31:00.000Z	MaNRo		I have, but that truth is that I'm new at linux, and do no understand that very well :S
2008-01-27T00:31:00.000Z	MaNRo		:(
2008-01-27T00:31:00.000Z	MaNRo		a noob here :P
2008-01-27T00:31:00.000Z	MaNRo		right now I'm using the drivers installed by ENVY, and is working OK
2008-01-27T00:32:00.000Z	MaNRo		but what bothers me is the fact that I can't install the drivers "by hand" :S
2008-01-27T00:32:00.000Z	danand		manro - dont worry someone will always be able to help - at command line type cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep EE and see what turns up
2008-01-27T00:33:00.000Z	MaNRo		ok...I'll "install" the driver again and post the log :)
2008-01-27T00:33:00.000Z	MaNRo	danand	- thanks a lot buddy!
2008-01-27T00:33:00.000Z	danand	MaNRo	- no problem
