2010-05-03T19:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	j0hn	 coule be becuse the capslock is a special key.
2010-05-03T19:01:00.000Z	j0hn	Dr_Willis	it appears to be some thing like that, but i need a work around this, isn't there any cheat way to do this?
2010-05-03T19:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	j0hn	 no idea. I use my caps lock as a caps lock.  Ive seen guides/ways to change capslock to a ctrl. and the gnome settings have things to remap it to other things.. but ive rarely needed to do it.
2010-05-03T19:03:00.000Z	j0hn	Dr_Willis	it's not difficult to set caps lock as control, but i can't make it work as tab
2010-05-03T19:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	j0hn	 if you set it to work as tab.. then it would be the same as using alt-tab.. so what do you gain by all this song and dance?
2010-05-03T19:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	j0hn	 and here i sit with a whole stack of keyboards.. :) i picked up for $1 each
2010-05-03T19:05:00.000Z	j0hn	Dr_Willis	it's in my notebook keyboard
2010-05-03T19:06:00.000Z	j0hn	Dr_Willis	i can't afford a new keyboard for my laptop
2010-05-03T19:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	j0hn	 bind to alt-~ perhaps :) thats close.
2010-05-03T19:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	j0hn	 i saw a gnome panel applet that let me mouse over program icon and just scroll the wheel also. (if you got a scroll wheel/area)
2010-05-03T19:07:00.000Z	j0hn	Dr_Willis	i haven't think on that, it's cool, but i will try a little bit more on the Caps Lock, it feels more like the tab key
2010-05-03T19:08:00.000Z	j0hn	Dr_Willis	changing windows with mouse scroll?
2010-05-03T19:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	j0hn	 yes. ive seen it done in other windos managers also.
2010-05-03T19:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	j0hn	 or remap extra mouse buttons
2010-05-03T19:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	j0hn	 for example i got 4 terminals open. I mouse over the terminal icon, and roll the wheel.  -> http://www.webupd8.org/2010/05/dockbarx-030-released-with-window.html
2010-05-03T19:09:00.000Z	j0hn	Dr_Willis	ye, i could just click on the window, actually that's what i do, but it is very very slow, keyboard shorcuts are faster
2010-05-03T19:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	j0hn	 there IS a feature where you can mouse to a corner and get a expose (showing all the windows in a smaller layout)
2010-05-03T19:11:00.000Z	j0hn	Dr_Willis	ya, i have think on those options, but i am more than accustomed to use Alt+Tab
2010-05-03T19:12:00.000Z	j0hn	Dr_Willis	could you set your Alt+Tab hotkey to Alt+Caps lock just to see if it happens the same thing that happens to me?
