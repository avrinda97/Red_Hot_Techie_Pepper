2011-05-04T05:22:00.000Z	eiriksvin	KM0201	i have been telling Angelic to search google and try to run the usb adapter native if its possible, thats what i have to do to get rid of that, but i got a different adapter
2011-05-04T05:22:00.000Z	KM0201	eiriksvin	hmm.
2011-05-07T19:33:00.000Z	KM0201	eiriksvin	a desktop launcher, can only launch one program at a time...
2011-05-07T19:34:00.000Z	KM0201	eiriksvin	oh i see what you're saying... sometimes you can look at system monitor, and find the process in there, and then try to start the program w/ whatever name is there.
2011-05-07T19:35:00.000Z	KM0201	eiriksvin	whats the name fo the program?
2011-05-07T19:36:00.000Z	KM0201	eiriksvin	if the program ahs a menu entry, you can also go to it int he menu and choose "add to desktop" and it will copy a launcher to the desktop
2011-05-31T08:52:00.000Z	KM0201	eiriksvin	what terminal emulator are you running?  gnome-terminal or what?
2011-05-31T08:59:00.000Z	KM0201	eiriksvin	it's not closing when i run it.
2011-05-31T08:59:00.000Z	KM0201	eiriksvin	which terminal emulator are you using?
2011-05-31T09:01:00.000Z	KM0201	eiriksvin	thats a desktop environment.. you're probably using gnome-terminal... try this... open a terminal, edit/profile preferences/ title and commands tab... at the bottom "When command exits" change it to "Hold terminal Open"
