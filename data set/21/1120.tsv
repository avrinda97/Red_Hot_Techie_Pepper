2011-04-10T13:02:00.000Z	randomperson		at random
2011-04-10T13:02:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	Have you looked in your Preferences?
2011-04-10T13:04:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	How about any add-ons that would do it?
2011-04-10T13:04:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	I meanta Firefox add-on
2011-04-10T13:05:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	Alright, well for Mozilla product support, go to the appropriate channel here: http://irc.mozilla.org/
2011-04-10T13:06:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	Well as far as I know Ubuntu has absolutely no bearing on browser tab behavior, so it's the browser, not Ubuntu.
2011-04-10T13:09:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	Should just be the file path to Knoversation.
2011-04-10T13:12:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	File path should be like... Alright, go to Places->Computer->File System
2011-04-10T13:13:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	So ocne you're at root (/) go to /usr/bin and see if "konversation" is in there
2011-04-10T13:15:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	Yeah, but I mean, they both open and close by themselves. Which means you have random middle-clicks going on somewhere.
2011-04-10T13:16:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	kriep was syaing like, some links, the web coder can say <a href="blah.html" target="_blank"></a> to open in a new tab by force
2011-04-10T13:18:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	Alright, so as somebody said earlier, launch it from the Terminal.
2011-04-10T13:20:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	Launching it from the Terminal did you receive any errors?
2011-04-10T13:20:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	So you'll want to open a Terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal) and type in the full file path. << /usr/bin/konversation >> (or whaever it's called).
2011-04-10T13:21:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	Ew. no. Not sudo.
2011-04-10T13:21:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	Only use sudo when you have to. Like editing files outside of /home/yourUSER.
2011-04-10T13:28:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	Try it
2011-04-10T13:31:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	Open a bunch of tabs, then start middle-clicking purposely to see if all is still well, then just sit your mouse over a tab and see if it closes.
2011-04-10T13:31:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	I know that doesn't necessarily mean "fixed" but still.
2011-04-10T13:31:00.000Z	Starminn	randomperson	On a laptop it's Button1+Button2 at the same time
