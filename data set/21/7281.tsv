2006-10-29T09:42:00.000Z	lobosque		how do i access a slave HD in ubuntu?
2006-10-29T09:43:00.000Z	POVaddct	lobosque	look at the output of "cat /proc/partitions" to see which hd* devices are present
2006-10-29T09:43:00.000Z	lobosque	POVaddct	i'll see
2006-10-29T09:44:00.000Z	lobosque		it lists hdb
2006-10-29T09:44:00.000Z	POVaddct	lobosque	any partitions on hdb or just hdb?
2006-10-29T09:44:00.000Z	lobosque		hdb and hdb1
2006-10-29T09:45:00.000Z	POVaddct	lobosque	okay, then you would mount hdb1 to a mount point (empty directory)
2006-10-29T09:45:00.000Z	lobosque		how?
2006-10-29T09:45:00.000Z	POVaddct	lobosque	with the mount command. read "man mount".
2006-10-29T09:46:00.000Z	lobosque		ok
2006-10-29T09:46:00.000Z	lobosque		(is there a hotkey to open console?)
2006-10-29T09:47:00.000Z	POVaddct	lobosque	if you are using gnome: i dont know. if you are using kde or xfce: alt-f2: xterm
2006-10-29T09:49:00.000Z	lobosque	POVaddct	mount -t type device dir. what shol i put?
2006-10-29T09:50:00.000Z	POVaddct	lobosque	type would be the filesystem type on the partition, device is the partition device (/dev/hdb1 in your case) and directory is an empty directory of your choice
2006-10-29T09:53:00.000Z	lobosque	POVaddct	can i use computer:/// as the ir?
2006-10-29T09:53:00.000Z	lobosque		*dir
2006-10-29T09:53:00.000Z	POVaddct	lobosque	that is not a directory
