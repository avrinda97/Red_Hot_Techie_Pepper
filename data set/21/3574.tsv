2010-02-20T11:30:00.000Z	Ziggyzxxyl	pepee	I've done that, I've been doing that for the past 8 hours and nothing has worked. I currently have a machine installing xp so my problem will be solved in about 1 or 2 hours.. I should have done this in the first place. mounting floppies in linux, I have discovered in impossible.
