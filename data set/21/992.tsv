2011-10-26T00:51:00.000Z	mrdeb	smw	do you need advice
2011-10-26T00:51:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	sure :-P
2011-10-26T00:52:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	I don't like unity
2011-10-26T00:52:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	the interface is slow, it uses too many fades and animations
2011-10-26T00:53:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	it also has a terrible multiwindows system
2011-10-26T00:53:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	don't much like the taskbar either
2011-10-26T00:54:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	it may work better for some, but it does not work well for the way I organize windows.
2011-10-26T00:56:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	at least with kde I can disable most effects and still have a functional desktop :-P. unity 2d is not pretty...
2011-10-26T00:57:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	... unity works at full speed for me. I just have a different standard of speed.
2011-10-26T00:58:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	I am listening :-)
2011-10-26T00:59:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	haha. I like my advanced power management god damn it!
2011-10-26T01:00:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	lxde is awesome. But it fails miserably on my laptop
2011-10-26T01:00:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	and on openbox I would need to spend so much time configuring... everything
2011-10-26T01:01:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	?
2011-10-26T01:02:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	I one time tried a system without any DE. It was hell. Want to open a pdf file? Go find a program. Found the program? Lets figure out how to make pcman automatically open pdfs with that program. Got it working? great
2011-10-26T01:02:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	oh wait, chrome doesn't know how to do it!
2011-10-26T01:02:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	I have been through this!
2011-10-26T01:03:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	oh really?
2011-10-26T01:04:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	and next thing you are going to do is tell me to use mutt and elinks
2011-10-26T01:05:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	gnome2 worked by magic and was decently fast. Fast is now measured not by how fast it boots but by how fast it responds..
2011-10-26T01:10:00.000Z	smw	mrdeb	thanks :-)
