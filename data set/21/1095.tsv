2011-02-03T06:37:00.000Z	MaffW	minimec	dial up
2011-02-03T06:37:00.000Z	MaffW	minimec	the phone goes into the computer and windows say it is dial up
2011-02-03T06:37:00.000Z	minimec	MaffW	you would need a ppp-dial software
2011-02-03T06:38:00.000Z	MaffW	minimec	how do i do that ?
2011-02-03T06:39:00.000Z	minimec	MaffW	INstall gnome-ppp for example. I don't know if that is the only solution. The last time I did a dial up connection, was some years ago.
2011-02-03T06:39:00.000Z	MaffW	minimec	how do i install that
2011-02-03T06:40:00.000Z	minimec	MaffW	Applications Ubuntu Software Center
2011-02-03T06:40:00.000Z	MaffW	minimec	it cannot find internet
2011-02-03T06:42:00.000Z	minimec	MaffW	MAybe that is also part of the install disk, I don't know. You may download it on another computer and transfer it via usb stick http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=gnome-ppp&suite=default&section=all&arch=any&searchon=names
2011-02-03T06:43:00.000Z	MaffW	minimec	my son say i should "are m are f forward slash" , what is that ?
2011-02-03T06:44:00.000Z	minimec	MaffW	Don't understand your question
2011-02-03T06:45:00.000Z	MaffW	minimec	i have dial up internet and i just today install ubuntu , how do i start the dial up ?
2011-02-03T06:47:00.000Z	minimec	MaffW	You need a software called gnome-ppp. Maybe you find that on the install disk. Try synaptic package software for that. That is the easist solution.
