2008-02-09T13:32:00.000Z	Kohler		whenever I try to move my cursor over any kind of music file, nautilus goes grey and becomes unresponsive. Are there any logs or anything I can check?
2008-02-09T13:32:00.000Z	jesse__	Kohler	just ask your question once, someone will help you if they can
2008-02-09T13:33:00.000Z	Kohler	jesse__	ok
2008-02-09T13:33:00.000Z	jesse__	Kohler	search the internet, run nautilus in some sort of debug mode with terminal output, or try removing the packages that might be involved in the process.
2008-02-09T13:34:00.000Z	jesse__	Kohler	iirc, there are special packages that enable that functionality in nautilus
2008-02-09T13:34:00.000Z	Kohler	jesse__	I have searched the net, posted on 5 different forums. I am not aware of how to run nautilus in debug mode. Could you please tell me how?
2008-02-09T13:35:00.000Z	jesse__	Kohler	lol, i dont know either :P
2008-02-09T13:35:00.000Z	jesse__	Kohler	is there any bug about it?
2008-02-09T13:35:00.000Z	Kohler	jesse__	lol ok. iirc? acronymfinder has so many definitions :P
2008-02-09T13:35:00.000Z	Kohler	jesse__	there are some which may be the same

2008-02-09T13:36:00.000Z	jesse__	Kohler	"if i recall/remembher correctly" :D
2008-02-09T13:36:00.000Z	Kohler	jesse__	thanks at least its not 'if I really cared' :D
2008-02-09T13:37:00.000Z	jesse__	Kohler	heh, never thought of that
2008-02-09T13:39:00.000Z	Kohler	jesse__	what makes it weird is that it doesn't even have to be a real mp3 file, it can just have a .mp3 extension :P
2008-02-09T13:41:00.000Z	Kohler	jesse__	I only have to move my cursor across it and it happens. Btw when I run nautilus from a shell, it just returns to the shell immediatly with no messages.
2008-02-09T13:42:00.000Z	jesse__	Kohler	yeah i know, i hate that :P
2008-02-09T13:42:00.000Z	Kohler	jesse__	can I ask you an unrelated question about networking lol?
2008-02-09T13:43:00.000Z	Kohler	jesse__	in my syslog it says 'Unable to find the Master Browser name STEVE<lb> for the workgroup STEVE.
2008-02-09T13:43:00.000Z	jesse__	Kohler	 your best asking the entire channel than just one channel member
2008-02-09T13:43:00.000Z	Kohler	jesse__	in my syslog it says 'Unable to find the Domain* Master Browser name STEVE<lb> for the workgroup STEVE.
