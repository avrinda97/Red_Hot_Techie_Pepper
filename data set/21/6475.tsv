2007-10-24T05:24:00.000Z	Flice		I'm using gutsy. The following problem appears both in Gnome and xfce. I have 2 panels on the screen: along top and bottom edges. With compiz enabled, the titlebar of each new window I open is covered by the top panel. Solutions?
2007-10-24T05:24:00.000Z	crdlb	Flice	do you have ccsm installed?
2007-10-24T05:25:00.000Z	Flice	crdlb	I have no idea what that is. I don't have package with this name installed.
2007-10-24T05:26:00.000Z	Flice	crdlb	hmm. no, I didn't have it
2007-10-24T05:26:00.000Z	Flice	crdlb	why was compiz working without it, then?
2007-10-24T05:26:00.000Z	crdlb	Flice	it's just a setings manager, but install it
2007-10-24T05:26:00.000Z	Flice	crdlb	I did
2007-10-24T05:26:00.000Z	crdlb	Flice	and run it with "ccsm" and make sure that the Place Windows plugin is checked
2007-10-24T05:28:00.000Z	Flice	crdlb	yes it is
2007-10-24T05:29:00.000Z	crdlb	Flice	well that was my guess :/
2007-10-24T05:29:00.000Z	Flice	crdlb	but it did fix the problem, as it seems
2007-10-24T05:29:00.000Z	Flice	crdlb	at least, I can't reproduce it with new windows
2007-10-24T05:30:00.000Z	Flice	crdlb	is it a workaround, then?
2007-10-24T05:30:00.000Z	Flice	crdlb	is this a common problem?
2007-10-24T05:30:00.000Z	crdlb	Flice	nah, that should be the default, the Place Windows plugin is responsible for initial placement for all plugins
2007-10-24T05:31:00.000Z	crdlb	Flice	somehow, it got disabled
2007-10-24T05:31:00.000Z	Flice	crdlb	weird. I don't think I ever installed this program
2007-10-24T05:31:00.000Z	Flice	crdlb	probably just another upgrade effect
2007-10-24T05:33:00.000Z	Flice	crdlb	ah.. actually, compiz wasn't running. now that I've run it, the problem still exists
2007-10-24T05:34:00.000Z	crdlb	Flice	you can try a different placement mode (click on the place windows icon in ccsm)
2007-10-24T05:36:00.000Z	Flice	crdlb	nothing changes. no luck
