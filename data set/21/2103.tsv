2010-02-09T09:35:00.000Z	jack5463	mneptok	it's not really offtopic it's just ubuntu
2010-02-09T09:36:00.000Z	mneptok	jack5463	this channel is for support for Ubuntu. not Ubuntu in general.
2010-02-09T09:37:00.000Z	mneptok	jack5463	stay on-topic.
2010-02-09T09:38:00.000Z	mneptok	jack5463	now you're being deliberately vague, and beginning to severely test my patience.
2010-02-09T09:40:00.000Z	jack5463	mneptok	My flash stopped working just now. Now i can't watch videos on youtube. ubuntu 9.10 on usb. How can I repair it? Some videos work and some don't.
2010-02-09T09:41:00.000Z	mneptok	jack5463	i386 or x86-64?
2010-02-09T09:42:00.000Z	jack5463	mneptok	i386
2010-02-09T09:42:00.000Z	mneptok	jack5463	sudo apt-get purge flash-installer && rm -r ~/.mozilla/firefox/$YOUR_PROFILE/cache/* && sudo apt-get install flash-installer
2010-02-09T09:42:00.000Z	jack5463	mneptok	yesterday it worked fine. today it doesn't work
2010-02-09T09:43:00.000Z	mneptok	jack5463	proprietary software stinks, don't it?
2010-02-09T09:45:00.000Z	jack5463	mneptok	I'm glad i didn't delete my stable os. I think good advice for some would be to delete ubuntu and reload it because it's a faster alternative to finding fixes for problems.
2010-02-09T09:48:00.000Z	mneptok	jack5463	i think god advice is "stop beating the same old tired drumbeat and stay on topic regarding specific issues with Ubuntu support"
2010-02-09T09:48:00.000Z	mneptok	jack5463	and that's the last time i'll give you that advice before i simply ban you.
2010-02-09T09:56:00.000Z	mneptok	jack5463	you need to specify your actual profile
2010-02-09T09:56:00.000Z	jack5463	mneptok	what's a profile?
2010-02-09T09:57:00.000Z	mneptok	jack5463	look in ~/.mozilla/firefox
2010-02-09T09:58:00.000Z	jack5463	mneptok	are you saying i should look up the definition?
2010-02-09T09:58:00.000Z	mneptok	jack5463	i am telling yo to go look inside a folder.
2010-02-09T09:58:00.000Z	mneptok	jack5463	do you know how display hidden folders and examine their contents?
2010-02-09T09:59:00.000Z	jack5463	mneptok	yes. so you're saying to delete the profile and create another one?
2010-02-09T10:00:00.000Z	mneptok	jack5463	no. can you tell what i mean by reading the terminal command i gave you, or would you like more explanation?
