2009-11-06T11:02:00.000Z	courpse	san123	He still needs a internet connection to connect to your proxy you run.
2009-11-06T11:03:00.000Z	courpse	san123	So your friends on the LAN then?
2009-11-06T11:04:00.000Z	san123	courpse	what do i do
2009-11-06T11:04:00.000Z	courpse	san123	Why do you need a proxy to get him on the net?
2009-11-06T11:06:00.000Z	courpse	san123	You said you were on the same LAN?
2009-11-06T11:06:00.000Z	courpse	san123	Then have him connect to the router via wifi then?
2009-11-06T11:08:00.000Z	courpse	san123	Aight, well i dont see why if you are on the same LAN then how he cant connect directly to the switch/router, but anyway, Squid is a web proxy.
2009-11-06T11:10:00.000Z	san123	courpse	how can Squid proxy work? it needs internet in both machines ?
2009-11-06T11:11:00.000Z	courpse	san123	See, this is what you should of said alot earlier.
2009-11-06T11:11:00.000Z	san123	courpse	sorry i dint knew what to say
2009-11-06T11:12:00.000Z	san123	courpse	ok  i will try thanks for help
2009-11-06T11:12:00.000Z	courpse	san123	Squid is also in the repo's.
2009-11-06T11:13:00.000Z	courpse	san123	https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/squid.html
2009-11-06T11:14:00.000Z	courpse	san123	It explains how to set up squid's conf files. so it will still be a useful howto.
