2007-12-12T07:13:00.000Z	tupson		Ok, for the last 24hrs, i have really been having issues with booting up in Ubuntu 7.10... it is literally taking 15mins to get the login screen and prior to that it just remains black without any log or description as to why its taking so long. Help!
2007-12-12T07:15:00.000Z	Pelo	tupson	did it ever boot properly in the past ?
2007-12-12T07:15:00.000Z	tupson	Pelo	it didnt ever have a splash screen (apparently with wide screen notebooks that is a known problem) but before it would like within 5mins
2007-12-12T07:16:00.000Z	Pelo	tupson	open /boot/grub/menu.lst and add nosplash to the line for booting ubuntu, see if it helps
2007-12-12T07:17:00.000Z	tupson	Pelo	the line currently says   /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.22-14-generic root=UUID=c212f47a-6ac8-4d76-ad03-619b97a22b10 ro quiet splash
2007-12-12T07:18:00.000Z	Pelo	tupson	 remove the splash word
2007-12-12T07:18:00.000Z	tupson	Pelo	so just /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.22-14-generic root=UUID=c212f47a-6ac8-4d76-ad03-619b97a22b10 ro quiet ?
2007-12-12T07:18:00.000Z	Pelo	tupson	looks about right
2007-12-12T07:19:00.000Z	Pelo	tupson	 give it a try
2007-12-12T07:26:00.000Z	tupson	Pelo	that worked, it now shows each loading line....
2007-12-12T07:26:00.000Z	tupson	Pelo	why would splash cause it not to load for 15mins though?
2007-12-12T07:27:00.000Z	Pelo	tupson	but does it boot at a resonable spead ?
2007-12-12T07:27:00.000Z	Pelo	tupson	did yo change the splash ?
2007-12-12T07:27:00.000Z	tupson	Pelo	yes, within 30 secs it went to a terminal login prompt
2007-12-12T07:28:00.000Z	tupson	Pelo	not at all....
2007-12-12T07:28:00.000Z	Pelo	tupson	I wuld assumethat the splash file might be corupted
2007-12-12T07:28:00.000Z	tupson	Pelo	I came in through out the day in here, asking how i can get my splash screen to work, because it was always black, but on my desktop i'd get the ubuntu splash screen
2007-12-12T07:28:00.000Z	tupson	Pelo	anyway i can correct that?
2007-12-12T07:29:00.000Z	Pelo	tupson	 I'll get ubotu to give you a link with theme stuff in it, in there you have instrucitons to change splash screens,  try to see if you can make something of that
2007-12-12T07:34:00.000Z	tupson	Pelo	the help link is up to v7.04 with Grub, does it still apply for v7.10?
2007-12-12T07:34:00.000Z	Pelo	tupson	 yes it does
