2005-04-19T06:38:00.000Z	ubuntoid		Anyone up on getting a palmpilot connected to Hoary?
2005-04-19T06:39:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ubuntoid	Got pilot-tools installed? Or any Gnome/KDE pilot tools?
2005-04-19T06:39:00.000Z	ubuntoid	EvilIdler	 It has gnome-pilot
2005-04-19T06:39:00.000Z	ubuntoid	EvilIdler	 Want to sync with Exchange
2005-04-19T06:40:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ubuntoid	Well, I dunno about Exchange..
2005-04-19T06:40:00.000Z	ubuntoid	EvilIdler	 Sorry, not Exchange, Evolution
2005-04-19T06:41:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ubuntoid	Does gnome-pilot have a config menu?
2005-04-19T06:41:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ubuntoid	Right-clicking the applet should bring something up, if you see the applet..
2005-04-19T06:42:00.000Z	ubuntoid	EvilIdler	 It asks some basic questions, but will not connect to pilot, as it seems to expect it on /dev/pilot (which I do not have)
2005-04-19T06:43:00.000Z	ubuntoid	EvilIdler	 It does say I can adjust settings in Gnome Control Center (which I don't see specifically)
2005-04-19T06:43:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ubuntoid	Link the serial device to /dev/pilot
2005-04-19T06:43:00.000Z	ubuntoid	EvilIdler	 It's usb
2005-04-19T06:43:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ubuntoid	Ah, that one is different, then..
2005-04-19T06:46:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ubuntoid	USB Palm should have a kernel module, I guess
2005-04-19T06:47:00.000Z	ubuntoid	EvilIdler	 It loads the visor module correctly, and puts the device on ttyUSB0
2005-04-19T06:47:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ubuntoid	Try "ln -s /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/pilot"?
2005-04-19T06:48:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ubuntoid	I'm hoping that it acts like a serial link, anyway :)
2005-04-19T06:48:00.000Z	ubuntoid	EvilIdler	I don't have any /dev/ttyUSB* on the system, not sure where it is sticking it
2005-04-19T06:48:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ubuntoid	http://www.pilot-link.org/README.usb
2005-04-19T06:58:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ubuntoid	Any luck?
2005-04-19T07:09:00.000Z	ubuntoid	EvilIdler	 Got it, thanks
