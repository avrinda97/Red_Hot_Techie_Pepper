2008-01-07T11:00:00.000Z	yaro		Hello
2008-01-07T11:00:00.000Z	yaro		I am having a problem with gcc and g++.
2008-01-07T11:02:00.000Z	yaro		Whenever I try to compile with g== I get spammed with a bunch of compiler errors that seem to suggest somehow my standard C and C++ libraries are... broken? D:
2008-01-07T11:02:00.000Z	yaro		g++*
2008-01-07T11:03:00.000Z	nickrud	yaro	did you install build-essential , or just gcc ?
2008-01-07T11:06:00.000Z	yaro	nickrud	I did a complete removal followed by an install of build-essential. Didn't work.
2008-01-07T11:08:00.000Z	nickrud	yaro	could it be that you're simply missing some headers for the libraries you're trying to use?
2008-01-07T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	yaro	one line would have sufficed, and I see your point. Sadly, I only do stupid compiles, enough to help beginners ;(
2008-01-07T11:22:00.000Z	nickrud	yaro	apt-cache depends build-essential , reinstall those. just reinstalling build-essential won't go that deep
2008-01-07T11:26:00.000Z	nickrud	yaro	try libstdc++6-4.1-dev
2008-01-07T11:29:00.000Z	nickrud	yaro	hrm, was libstdc++6-4.1-dev listed as a dependency, apt-rdepends (recursive search of all dependencies) kicked that up at me
2008-01-07T11:30:00.000Z	yaro	nickrud	No, it wasn't... and I don't have a command apt-rdepends.
2008-01-07T11:31:00.000Z	nickrud	yaro	it's a separate package you'll need to install
2008-01-07T11:39:00.000Z	yaro	nickrud	Explain bootstrap g++?
2008-01-07T11:39:00.000Z	nickrud	yaro	use gcc to recompile gcc . one of the first steps in creating a linux from scratch
2008-01-07T11:40:00.000Z	yaro	nickrud	How would I go about doing that, with GCC source?
2008-01-07T11:40:00.000Z	nickrud	yaro	it was a joke, really. You don't wanna go that route
2008-01-07T11:41:00.000Z	nickrud	yaro	I happened across the build-dep idea mentioned earlier
2008-01-07T11:41:00.000Z	yaro	nickrud	I am almost tempted to backup and reinstall Linux... but thats a horribly sloppy and... er... Windows way of doing it, isn;t it?
2008-01-07T11:41:00.000Z	nickrud	yaro	sometimes a big hammer is the right solution
2008-01-07T11:44:00.000Z	nickrud	yaro	I've probably seen more reinstalls over sound, it's a complex subject these days and not many people understand it enough to help on line
