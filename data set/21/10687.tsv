2005-03-16T15:49:00.000Z	saif		hello every1
2005-03-16T15:51:00.000Z	saif		hehe, i just installed ubuntu warty and it asked me if i wish to download software from the internet and i said yes, how long is this gonna take approx.? on a 128 connection?
2005-03-16T15:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	saif	make your will now ;-)
2005-03-16T15:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	saif	you can get it if you want
2005-03-21T17:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	saif	just a guess - you ran a graphical app as root and your ~/.ICEauthority file is now root:root instead of saif:saif
2005-03-21T17:24:00.000Z	saif	thoreauputic	well, the last i remember is i was installing apache2, but anyways, let's consider ur are right, what is the solution to this/??
2005-03-21T17:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	saif	from a terminal, run ls -l ~/.ICEauthority   If the file, as I suspect, is owned by root, delete it and try logging in again
2005-03-21T17:27:00.000Z	saif	thoreauputic	-rw-r--r-x saif saif :(
2005-03-21T17:27:00.000Z	saif	thoreauputic	delete it anyways?
2005-03-21T17:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	saif	it should be just rw for the owner (you in this case)
2005-03-21T17:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	saif	mine is     -rw-------    1 peter    peter
2005-03-21T17:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	saif	but I don't know if that will help (odd permissions, though)
2005-03-21T17:31:00.000Z	saif	thoreauputic	yippi yey!! it worked! thanx alot man!
2005-03-21T17:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	saif	you're welcome :)
2006-05-24T14:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	saif	"open" ports are ports that are listening
2006-05-24T14:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	saif	so running a server "opens" them
2006-05-24T14:41:00.000Z	saif	thoreauputic	i'm not running a server, i need it for bittorrent, i changed the port for forwording for my router, and i need to allow incoming connections!
2006-05-24T14:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	saif	erm, bittorrent acts as a server to the people who are getting your stuff
2006-05-24T14:43:00.000Z	saif	thoreauputic	well, it tells me that i am behind a firewall!!
2006-05-24T14:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	saif	hmm - I didn't need to do anything for bittorrent so I don't really know, sorry
2006-05-24T14:44:00.000Z	saif	thoreauputic	thanx!
