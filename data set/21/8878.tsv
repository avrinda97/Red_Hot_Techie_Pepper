2005-12-26T08:48:00.000Z	cjohnson		Hey, I just installed Ubuntu yesterday, and whenever I try to view a movie with Totem, I get an error message about "video output is already in use."  Any ideas?
2005-12-26T08:49:00.000Z	cjohnson		(And for isolating things like Apache for added security)
2005-12-26T08:49:00.000Z	cjohnson		Heh
2005-12-26T08:50:00.000Z	cjohnson		Also, I've (already) forgotton my root password :/   Is there a simple way of resetting it?  Like, how do you boot into single-user mode with GRUB?
2005-12-26T08:50:00.000Z	dooglus	cjohnson	just "sudo passwd" will let you reset the root password
2005-12-26T08:50:00.000Z	dooglus	cjohnson	although you're not supposed to set a root password in ubuntu
2005-12-26T08:51:00.000Z	cjohnson	dooglus	?
2005-12-26T08:51:00.000Z	dooglus	cjohnson	the root password is locked by default.  use "sudo" to run commands as root.  the password is prompts for is your password, not root's
2005-12-26T08:51:00.000Z	cjohnson		To be honest I don't remember setting the root password during install... I'm just looking at this "37 updates available" thing
2005-12-26T08:51:00.000Z	cjohnson	dooglus	Ah, okay
2005-12-26T08:52:00.000Z	dooglus	cjohnson	it's likely that you haven't forgotten your root password, but that you never had one to start with.
2005-12-26T08:52:00.000Z	cjohnson	dooglus	I see... That's interesting idea, btw, of just using sudo for everything
2005-12-26T08:53:00.000Z	dooglus	cjohnson	it means that there's no root password for crackers to brute-force
2005-12-26T08:53:00.000Z	dooglus	cjohnson	but on the down side it means that anyone getting access to your user account automatically has root
2005-12-26T08:53:00.000Z	cjohnson	dooglus	But they can still brute force a user account, and from their do sudo, right?
2005-12-26T08:54:00.000Z	dooglus	cjohnson	from their own sudo?  why?
2005-12-26T08:54:00.000Z	cjohnson		I mean, if a hacker gets my account password now, they basically have root access, don't they?
2005-12-26T08:55:00.000Z	dooglus	cjohnson	yes, that's right
2005-12-26T08:56:00.000Z	dooglus	cjohnson	sorry, I was confused by your unconventional spelling of "there".
2005-12-26T08:56:00.000Z	cjohnson	dooglus	ah, oops
2005-12-26T08:57:00.000Z	dooglus	cjohnson	I imagine it's easier to break into a user account than it is into a root account - users run all kinds of insecure apps, like web browsers, email clients, instant messaging, etc.  any hole in one of those could give someone access - and then it's a simple "sudo" to get root
