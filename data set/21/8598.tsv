2006-03-07T09:10:00.000Z	Extreme_Unction		Well, using common sense I'd say 5.10 considering you'd just use auto-update and have the same crap as 5.10 anyway.
2006-03-07T09:10:00.000Z	Extreme_Unction		Heh.
2006-03-07T09:10:00.000Z	Extreme_Unction		So, yeah, 5.10.. Though I suggest you get light-weight window manager
2006-03-07T09:10:00.000Z	Extreme_Unction		Not Ubuntu/KDE
2006-03-07T09:11:00.000Z	Extreme_Unction		lol
2006-03-07T09:13:00.000Z	Extreme_Unction		That's Ironic.
2006-03-07T09:13:00.000Z	Extreme_Unction		You've got a syncmaster monitor but your kernel won't sync..
2006-03-07T09:13:00.000Z	Extreme_Unction		Heh
2006-03-07T09:13:00.000Z	Extreme_Unction		Well, that's sarcasm.

2006-03-07T09:14:00.000Z	Extreme_Unction	Plouj	Have you tried reinstalling Ubuntu?
2006-03-07T09:15:00.000Z	Plouj	Extreme_Unction	yeah, well, I just installed it for the second time
2006-03-07T09:15:00.000Z	Plouj		I haven't been able to boot into an installed system yet
2006-03-07T09:15:00.000Z	Plouj		I have suspicion that its not working because ubuntu is on a SATA drive
2006-03-07T09:15:00.000Z	Plouj		but I'm not sure
2006-03-07T09:15:00.000Z	Extreme_Unction		What CPU architecture?
2006-03-07T09:16:00.000Z	Plouj	Extreme_Unction	amd64
2006-03-07T09:16:00.000Z	Extreme_Unction		amd64 ubuntu?
2006-03-07T09:16:00.000Z	Plouj	Extreme_Unction	yes, I got the 64bit one
