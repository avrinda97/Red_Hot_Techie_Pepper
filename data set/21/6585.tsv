2007-04-16T12:21:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		if this kernel compile fails, who do i yell at?
2007-04-16T12:22:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LordLimeca1	yourself
2007-04-16T12:22:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LordLimeca1	binary kernels are there for a reason ;)
2007-04-16T12:22:00.000Z	LordLimeca1	NickGarvey	current kernel sound dont work
2007-04-16T12:23:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LordLimeca1	oh alright, well why would it not work?
2007-04-16T12:23:00.000Z	LordLimeca1	NickGarvey	there was a recent update to kernel something or other, alsa broke.  Tried installing new alsa drivers, kernel said oops, i said uhoh, and now am installing new kernel
2007-04-16T12:23:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LordLimeca1	sounds god to me
2007-04-16T12:24:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LordLimeca1	do you know how to compile one?  I came from gentoo so I have compiled a few more than I like too admit...
2007-04-16T12:25:00.000Z	LordLimeca1	NickGarvey	just learned how, compiled one, and ping worked, but lynx, irssi, and firefox didnt (network wise)
2007-04-16T12:26:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LordLimeca1	no luck :(
2007-04-16T12:30:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LordLimeca1	it will force some things to happen..
2007-04-16T12:30:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LordLimeca1	I don't know full details though
2007-04-16T12:32:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LordLimeca1	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonCustomizations#head-f87ab027cad4d5a0ce0787c76b15f2188d41f9e7
2007-04-16T12:33:00.000Z	LordLimeca1	NickGarvey	that answers my question quite nicely :)
2007-04-16T12:37:00.000Z	LordLimeca1	NickGarvey	just got this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15927/  do i need to recompile -_-
2007-04-16T12:37:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LordLimeca1	what sources do you have?
2007-04-16T12:38:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LordLimeca1	there is a linux-sources package I believe..
2007-04-16T12:39:00.000Z	LordLimeca1	NickGarvey	i already have the 2.6.20.7 vanilla kernel, compiled it, ran into issues (can ping google.com, but cant browse it)
2007-04-16T12:40:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LordLimeca1	try the chocolate one? (ahaha.. its late forgive my humor)
2007-04-16T12:40:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LordLimeca1	did you try the one in the repos though?  (I have never compiled a kernel under ubuntu to be honest)
2007-04-16T12:41:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LordLimeca1	have you read the kernel compile guide?
