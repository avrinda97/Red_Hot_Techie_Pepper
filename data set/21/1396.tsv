2012-05-25T20:47:00.000Z	oCean	meharzada	you are new, but you are using release 10.10?
2012-05-25T20:42:00.000Z	oCean	meharzada	the sudo password is your own (user) password
2012-05-25T20:42:00.000Z	oCean	meharzada	also, please note that 10.10 is end of life since april
2012-05-25T20:42:00.000Z	oCean	meharzada	does it work when you use it in a terminal?
2012-05-25T20:43:00.000Z	oCean	meharzada	so on a terminal prompt, running   sudo -i   works with your own password?
2012-05-25T20:44:00.000Z	oCean	meharzada	please try it in a terminal first, so we know you are using the correct password
2012-05-25T20:48:00.000Z	oCean	meharzada	please use a more recent version (12.04 is latest) Version 10.10 is end of life and no longer supported
2012-05-25T20:48:00.000Z	oCean	meharzada	yes, but fresh install is much easier
2012-05-25T20:49:00.000Z	oCean	meharzada	it's a long way from 10.10 to 12.04
2012-05-25T20:51:00.000Z	oCean	meharzada	your version is too old, the repositories (software) is no longer available
2012-05-25T20:52:00.000Z	oCean	meharzada	so, FIRST install a new version THEN come ask for support
