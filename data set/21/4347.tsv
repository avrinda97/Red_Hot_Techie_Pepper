2009-12-27T15:51:00.000Z	wgrant	rsk	Um, really?
2009-12-27T15:51:00.000Z	rsk	wgrant	yea?
2009-12-27T15:51:00.000Z	wgrant	rsk	Why?
2009-12-27T15:51:00.000Z	wgrant	rsk	That doesn't make sense.
2009-12-27T15:51:00.000Z	rsk	wgrant	nvidia have better drivers
2009-12-27T15:51:00.000Z	wgrant	rsk	Not better than the open source ATI and Intel ones.
2009-12-27T15:51:00.000Z	rsk	wgrant	it's indeed very much better. the ati drivers are buggy and not even feature-complete
2009-12-27T15:52:00.000Z	rsk	wgrant	the intel drivers for linux are very bad to the ones compared in windows
2009-12-27T15:52:00.000Z	wgrant	rsk	The Intel drivers these days are excellent.
2009-12-27T15:52:00.000Z	wgrant	rsk	The open source ATI ones too.
2009-12-27T15:52:00.000Z	rsk	wgrant	sure stabilitty-wise. but not pefromance-wise
2009-12-27T15:52:00.000Z	wgrant		Particularly in what will become 10.04.
2009-12-27T15:52:00.000Z	rsk	wgrant	ati aren't featurecomplete and some cards are not even supported
2009-12-27T15:52:00.000Z	rsk	wgrant	dont argue otherwise
2009-12-27T15:53:00.000Z	wgrant	rsk	r600/r700 DRI is now present.
2009-12-27T15:53:00.000Z	wgrant	rsk	I run it fine with open source drivers on my laptop that is not six months old.
2009-12-27T15:53:00.000Z	rsk	wgrant	yea you run it fine. but it's still not as good as nvidia driver
2009-12-27T15:54:00.000Z	wgrant	rsk	The short-term outlook for free ATI drivers is excellent. The same cannot be said for nvidia cards, and the proprietary drivers fail to even support RandR 1.2.
2009-12-27T15:54:00.000Z	rsk	wgrant	randr 1.2 isn't as important as peformance and stability
2009-12-27T15:55:00.000Z	rsk		at least for me
2009-12-27T15:55:00.000Z	wgrant	rsk	My drivers are perfectly stable, and reasonably performant.
