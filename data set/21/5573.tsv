2007-09-25T06:48:00.000Z	rpj8		HOwever I know I'm allowed to explore the network and even the computers on the network as when I try in windows it works
2007-09-25T06:48:00.000Z	rpj8		Hey guys, I'm in a university setting and my samba share isn't working; when I click "Windows Network" nothing shows up at all
2007-09-25T06:48:00.000Z	kkathman	rpj8	 are the shares configured to be seen?
2007-09-25T06:49:00.000Z	rpj8	kkathman	Yeah. I can see them in windows. ther'es about 50+ machines that come up.
2007-09-25T06:49:00.000Z	kkathman	rpj8	 also it really helps in everyone is in the same workgroup too
2007-09-25T06:49:00.000Z	kkathman	rpj8	 do you see the machines themselves when you do the places - network ?
2007-09-25T06:50:00.000Z	rpj8	kkathman	No I do not, sir
2007-09-25T06:50:00.000Z	kkathman	rpj8	 hmm ok so that sounds like security/share settings on the winboxes maybe
2007-09-25T06:50:00.000Z	kkathman	rpj8	 or similar settings on the linux boxes
2007-09-25T06:51:00.000Z	rpj8	kkathman	Hm. Are you suggesting that I'm not able to see windows shares through linux due to security issues/features in the network?

2007-09-25T06:52:00.000Z	kkathman	rpj8	 well two things comes to mind 1) firewall (probably not)  or 2) The actual shares on the other boxes arent configured to be shared or have network names for sharing
2007-09-25T06:52:00.000Z	kkathman	rpj8	 are they winboxes? or linux?
2007-09-25T06:52:00.000Z	rpj8	kkathman	Probably Winboxes. I'm at a university, so it's a bit inconvenient to go around asking everyone
2007-09-25T06:53:00.000Z	kkathman	rpj8	 yeah - on those windows boxes admin has to right click the shares (folders) and set the sharing parameters
2007-09-25T06:53:00.000Z	kkathman		otherwise they wont show up
2007-09-25T06:54:00.000Z	rpj8	kkathman	Yes, this I do know. So you're saying they won't show up in linux if they don't have shared folders?
2007-09-25T06:54:00.000Z	rpj8	kkathman	But they will if you're in windows
2007-09-25T06:54:00.000Z	kkathman	rpj8	 correct they wont and yes they "might" on a win network - another possibility is that samba has been disabled on the winboxes (unlikely tho)
2007-09-25T06:55:00.000Z	rpj8	kkathman	I see. There's also a chance I'm on the wrong workgroup entirely... i kind of stupidly assumed they were all in "Workgroup" since that's what it was at my house
2007-09-25T06:56:00.000Z	kkathman	rpj8	 yes that could be a prob also
