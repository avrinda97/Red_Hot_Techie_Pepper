2009-06-27T04:50:00.000Z	Kjell	raylu	I thought that ssh is rock solid.
2009-06-27T04:51:00.000Z	raylu	Kjell	what?
2009-06-27T04:51:00.000Z	Kjell	raylu	For connecting with other system.
2009-06-27T04:51:00.000Z	raylu	Kjell	for getting a shell, yes. for writing files as root with rsync, not so much
2009-06-27T04:52:00.000Z	Kjell	raylu	I been using sshfs. But not for backup stuff.
2009-06-27T05:25:00.000Z	raylu	Kjell	sa1 has been quiet for a while.
2009-06-27T05:26:00.000Z	Kjell	raylu	I have a pm con with him. Hard to understand his english though
2009-06-27T05:26:00.000Z	raylu	Kjell	which is why i suggested the arabic channel to him
2009-06-27T05:26:00.000Z	raylu	Kjell	though it's highly unlikely this will help you,
2009-06-27T07:19:00.000Z	raylu	Kjell	/n or /names
2009-06-27T07:19:00.000Z	raylu	Kjell	/scrollback levelclear -level clientcrap
2009-06-27T07:19:00.000Z	raylu	Kjell	will clear the output of /who
2009-06-27T07:19:00.000Z	raylu	Kjell	in short, /sb l -l clientcrap
2009-06-27T07:20:00.000Z	Kjell	raylu	I guess I stick with weechat. It has the userlist ;)
2009-06-27T07:21:00.000Z	raylu	Kjell	actually, i've found that the userlist is quite useless
2009-06-27T07:23:00.000Z	Kjell	raylu	well it gives you a quick look on who is channel op
2009-06-27T07:24:00.000Z	raylu	Kjell	no, it lists _all_ the people in the channel. you generally only care about a few
2009-06-27T07:25:00.000Z	Kjell	raylu	perhaps you are right. But you know old habits are hard to change
2009-06-29T04:29:00.000Z	Kjell	raylu	start up application
2009-06-29T04:29:00.000Z	raylu	Kjell	that doesn't prevent the adapter itself from powering up
2009-06-29T04:30:00.000Z	Kjell	raylu	Then you can remove the module when the modprobe list I guess
