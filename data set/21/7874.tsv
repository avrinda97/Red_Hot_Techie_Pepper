2006-06-27T12:48:00.000Z	fdsd		Do you guys have a ppc channel?
2006-06-27T12:48:00.000Z	fdsd		hey guys, How do I disable stderr in the console?  Its spitting tons of junk at me while I am working
2006-06-27T12:49:00.000Z	dooglus	fdsd	what kind of junk?
2006-06-27T12:49:00.000Z	fdsd	dooglus	like I stuff from my firewire drive, and random stuff, I just need to turn off the messaging
2006-06-27T12:50:00.000Z	dooglus	fdsd	kernel messages then?
2006-06-27T12:50:00.000Z	dooglus	fdsd	do they all have time stamps to millionths of a second?
2006-06-27T12:51:00.000Z	dooglus	fdsd	things like: "Jun  9 23:59:07 chrislap kernel: [4294738.882000]  Bluetooth: HCI device and connection manager initialized"
2006-06-27T12:52:00.000Z	dooglus	fdsd	is klogd running?
2006-06-27T12:52:00.000Z	fdsd	dooglus	not sure
2006-06-27T12:52:00.000Z	fdsd	dooglus	fixed it though
2006-06-27T13:44:00.000Z	dooglus	fdsd	uninstall gdm - or do you want to be able to run it?
2006-06-27T13:44:00.000Z	fdsd	dooglus	I want to run it
2006-06-27T13:44:00.000Z	dooglus	fdsd	sysv-rc-conf is a package which can edit the runlevels for you.  untick 'gdm' in level 2.
2006-06-27T13:44:00.000Z	fdsd	dooglus	is that in /etc?
2006-06-27T13:45:00.000Z	dooglus	fdsd	it's a package - install it.
2006-06-27T13:45:00.000Z	fdsd	dooglus	cant, i am modifing the livecd
2006-06-27T13:45:00.000Z	dooglus	fdsd	in that case, you can just remove /etc/rc2.d/*gdm
2006-06-27T13:46:00.000Z	fdsd	dooglus	but isnt there a file I can edit, so it will properly disable gdm?
2006-06-27T13:46:00.000Z	dooglus	fdsd	gdm runs when you boot because of the presence of /etc/rc2.d/*gdm ; if you remove that link, it won't run at boot, but will still be runnable by hand.
2006-06-27T13:46:00.000Z	fdsd	dooglus	good enough thanks:)
2006-06-27T13:47:00.000Z	dooglus	fdsd	you said earlier that you didn't want to disable gdm, because you want to be able to run it
