2008-06-07T12:47:00.000Z	MaskedOne		So i keep having web browsers just up and disapear on me, any clue why?
2008-06-07T12:47:00.000Z	MaskedOne		usualy happens when clicking a link or right clicking an image and clicking save
2008-06-07T12:47:00.000Z	MaskedOne		Has happened in FF3, FF2, Epiphany, you name it
2008-06-07T12:48:00.000Z	Gin	MaskedOne	bad image
2008-06-07T12:48:00.000Z	MaskedOne		gin: why does it just disapear on me....seems random since it also happened when clicking a link
2008-06-07T12:49:00.000Z	Gin	MaskedOne	when it crashed, was there any site using flash?
2008-06-07T12:49:00.000Z	MaskedOne		gin: not that I was aware of
2008-06-07T12:49:00.000Z	MaskedOne	Gin	Just tried saving the same image and worked fine now
2008-06-07T12:49:00.000Z	MaskedOne		just google and then the image in another tab
2008-06-07T12:50:00.000Z	Gin	MaskedOne	I have this problem too, but it happens less with ff3 rc2
2008-06-07T12:50:00.000Z	MaskedOne		shouldn't happen at all lol
2008-06-07T12:50:00.000Z	MaskedOne		Im trying to parade Linux as the pinnacle of stability but cant when this happpens lol
2008-06-07T12:51:00.000Z	Gin	MaskedOne	flash can be the cause tho
2008-06-07T12:51:00.000Z	MaskedOne		also was odd how it has happened in ever browser i have tried, randomly
2008-06-07T12:52:00.000Z	Gin	MaskedOne	try IE7 on Ubuntu then :P
2008-06-07T12:52:00.000Z	MaskedOne	Gin	Any fixes on the way? Never had this problem with older Ubuntu...
2008-06-07T12:52:00.000Z	MaskedOne		lol IE7 would be worse yet
2008-06-07T12:52:00.000Z	Gin	MaskedOne	not that I known of
2008-06-07T12:52:00.000Z	Gin	MaskedOne	try asking in the forum, maybe some one has a work around
2008-06-07T12:52:00.000Z	MaskedOne	Gin	Also is it just me or does Opera Browser not exist in the repos anymore?
