2012-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	Flannel	agamemnus	Can you please pastebin the past few commands you've tried/output you've gotten?
2012-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	agamemnus	Flannel	That's exactly what I'm doing :|
2012-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	Flannel	agamemnus	No, I meant copy a bunch of lines (10, 15, something like that), and then pasting them (all together) into paste.ubuntu.com
2012-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	Flannel	agamemnus	So we can see prompts, commands, and responses, all together.
2012-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	agamemnus	Flannel	http://www.freebasic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=168662#p168662
2012-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	Flannel	agamemnus	Yes, please pastebin the past few commands you've done here
2012-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	Flannel	agamemnus	Are you on a 64bit OS right now?
2012-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	Flannel	agamemnus	The above errors are why I asked for a pastebin of commans/responses.
2012-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	Flannel	agamemnus	You'll want to install ia32-libs
2012-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	Flannel	agamemnus	OR better yet, find a FreeBasic that's built for 64bit
2012-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	Flannel	agamemnus	This is really a 'problem' with FreeBasic, not the OS.
