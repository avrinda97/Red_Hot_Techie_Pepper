2008-04-27T04:03:00.000Z	kasimir		what is the new Ubuntu way to changing screen resolution?  Because Hardy Heron cannot use the right resolution on this computer with a clean install
2008-04-27T04:04:00.000Z	hellonull	kasimir	do you have an nvidia or ati graphics card? if so you need to make sure you have the correct drivers installed first
2008-04-27T04:04:00.000Z	kasimir	hellonull	thanks for helping me! I have an intel embedded graphics card
2008-04-27T04:08:00.000Z	kasimir		what is the Ubuntu way of changing my resolution/monitor? Should I use xorg.conf?
2008-04-27T04:08:00.000Z	hellonull	kasimir	no problem. what is your graphics card?
2008-04-27T04:09:00.000Z	hellonull	kasimir	normally you can go to system -> preferences -> screen resolution
2008-04-27T04:09:00.000Z	kasimir	hellonull	yeah, but it does have anything that works with my monitor... my monitor uses 1600x1200 at 75 Hz, and this current resolution is just hurting my eyes
2008-04-27T04:10:00.000Z	kasimir	hellonull	it seems that the are that I used to find out my hardware information is gone?
2008-04-27T04:11:00.000Z	hellonull	kasimir	in terminal the command "lspci" should tell you about your graphics card
2008-04-27T04:12:00.000Z	kasimir	hellonull	thanks, it is ' Intel Corporation 82845G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE Chipset Integrated Graphics Device (rev 03)'
2008-04-27T04:16:00.000Z	kasimir	hellonull	it seems that dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg does nothing
2008-04-27T04:16:00.000Z	hellonull	kasimir	read this thread it may help you http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=675870
2008-04-27T04:17:00.000Z	kasimir	hellonull	hm... but "Screens and Graphics" doesn't exist in Hardy Heron
2008-04-27T04:17:00.000Z	kasimir	hellonull	or at least I can't find it!
2008-04-27T04:17:00.000Z	hellonull	kasimir	it is system -> preferences -> screen resolution
2008-04-27T04:18:00.000Z	kasimir	hellonull	hm... only 5 resolutions come up with that, I can't select my graphics card... am I doing something wrong?
2008-04-27T04:21:00.000Z	hellonull	kasimir	my guess would be that you have to edit the xorg.conf and add in your resolution
2008-04-27T04:21:00.000Z	kasimir	hellonull	okay, thanks, I'll try that
2008-04-27T04:22:00.000Z	hellonull	kasimir	np. that's the extent of my graphics knowledge, if that doesn't work then i'm afraid i can't be of anymore help :\.
2008-04-27T04:25:00.000Z	kasimir	hellonull	okay, I made the changes.  I'll restart X, and thanks for you help!!
2008-04-27T04:25:00.000Z	kasimir	hellonull	hopefully this will work :)
