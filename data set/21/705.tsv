2011-08-16T15:04:00.000Z	love4linux		Hello.. I installed ubuntu 11.04 on an Asus Eee Pc 1015pe and the wireless card (RT3090) is not functioning. It is recognized by ubuntu in lspci but the networkmanager refuses to start the wireless device.. can anyone help me?
2011-08-16T15:05:00.000Z	love4linux		any drivers maybe that i have to install?
2011-08-16T15:05:00.000Z	Night-Hacks	love4linux	use hardware and drivers
2011-08-16T15:05:00.000Z	love4linux		okay checking it now
2011-08-16T15:09:00.000Z	love4linux	Night-Hacks	i cant find anything listing "hardware and drivers"... I only found "additional drivers" in the control center
2011-08-16T15:10:00.000Z	Night-Hacks		 love4linux: i meant in system->administration->
2011-08-16T15:10:00.000Z	Night-Hacks		 love4linux: hardware drivers
2011-08-16T15:10:00.000Z	love4linux	Night-Hacks	strange...there is nothing there as well
2011-08-16T15:11:00.000Z	love4linux	Night-Hacks	maybe I should install a package for that?
2011-08-16T15:11:00.000Z	Night-Hacks	love4linux	yes, im on older version
2011-08-16T15:12:00.000Z	love4linux	Night-Hacks	okay brb to install that
2011-08-16T15:20:00.000Z	love4linux	Night-Hacks	the only application that I found about listing hardware is lshw-gtk... is that the one you are talking about?
2011-08-16T15:22:00.000Z	Night-Hacks	love4linux	let me check
2011-08-16T15:23:00.000Z	love4linux	Night-Hacks	how would this application help me fix my wireless NIC? shouldn't I check if the module for the wireless card is loaded in the kernele?
2011-08-16T15:23:00.000Z	Night-Hacks		 love4linux: have you installed the driver ?
2011-08-16T15:24:00.000Z	love4linux	Night-Hacks	emm no I havent but I searched in synaptic for ralink or rt3090 and it didnt come up with anything... do you know the name of the driver for this wireless nic?
2011-08-16T15:28:00.000Z	Night-Hacks	love4linux	check it
2011-08-16T15:28:00.000Z	Night-Hacks		 love4linux: lspci -k
2011-08-16T15:28:00.000Z	Night-Hacks	love4linux	check your nic is using which module
2011-08-16T15:29:00.000Z	love4linux	Night-Hacks	I found a threat in ubuntu's forum about this wnic and i have to install proprietary drivers from ralink
2011-08-16T15:29:00.000Z	love4linux	Night-Hacks	I will do that I ll check back with you
