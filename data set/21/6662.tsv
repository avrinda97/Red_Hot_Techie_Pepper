2007-09-27T16:36:00.000Z	Zylstra555		Hello, a friend of mine needs to find out his CPU temperature. How would he go about doing this in Ubuntu?
2007-09-27T16:36:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Zylstra555	you can use a panel applet
2007-09-27T16:37:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MasterShrek	How would you use a panel applet? Is there one specifically?
2007-09-27T16:38:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Zylstra555	actually i think i installed extra panel applets, but u should be able to see it in system monitor
2007-09-30T10:05:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Zylstra555	dont u have dhcp?
2007-09-30T10:05:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MasterShrek	Yes, however, its a server, and its connected to a router. It needs to use a static IP, right?
2007-09-30T10:06:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Zylstra555	it doesnt HAVE to, and i dont really know how to set up a static cuz ive never had to
2007-09-30T10:06:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Zylstra555	ifconfig --help    should get you a start
2007-09-30T10:07:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MasterShrek	I already am using the IP configuration, the information I originally sent over this channel (the first string of text) contained the information I didnt understand
2007-09-30T10:11:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Zylstra555	can your router give it a static address based on its mac?
2007-09-30T10:11:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MasterShrek	Probably
2007-09-30T10:11:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MasterShrek	I can try
2007-09-30T10:12:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Zylstra555	ctrl+c
2007-09-30T10:12:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MasterShrek	it beeped at me... Ill just open another terminal
2007-09-30T10:16:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MasterShrek	"sudo tasksel install lamp-server" returns Aotutyde fauked (100)
2007-09-30T10:16:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Zylstra555	???
2007-09-30T10:17:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MasterShrek	I think its because I have a few things running in the background... and I probably shouldent
2007-09-30T10:17:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MasterShrek	How do I end a terminal (number 2 specifically)
2007-09-30T10:17:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Zylstra555	click the close button
2007-09-30T10:18:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MasterShrek	Its not graphical
2007-09-30T10:18:00.000Z	Zylstra555	MasterShrek	I cant, a terminal "froze" at a screen, can I logout terminal 2 from another terminal?
