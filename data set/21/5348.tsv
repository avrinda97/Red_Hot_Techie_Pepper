2007-11-02T22:24:00.000Z	rico	hipodilski	did it work?
2007-11-02T22:25:00.000Z	rico	hipodilski	info on why/how that works: http://wiki.compiz-fusion.org/Hardware/Blacklist
2007-11-02T22:25:00.000Z	hipodilski	rico	I don't know but there may be problems right?
2007-11-02T22:26:00.000Z	rico	hipodilski	the only problem is that XV video doesn't work. you can easily fix this by going to gstreamer-properties, and setting your video output to something not XV
