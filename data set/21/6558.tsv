2007-03-10T11:58:00.000Z	dager	jusama14	have you installed the appropriate kernel headers?
2007-03-10T12:02:00.000Z	dager	jusama14	"linux-kernel-headers" should be there
2007-03-10T11:59:00.000Z	dager	jusama14	thats most likely why its not working :)
2007-03-10T11:59:00.000Z	jusama14	dager	how do i install it?
2007-03-10T12:00:00.000Z	dager	jusama14	check synaptic for "kernel-headers" and install the appropriate one.. then reinstall ndiswrapper packages, just to be sure
2007-03-10T12:00:00.000Z	dager	jusama14	then you should be good, or at least in a better position
2007-03-10T12:00:00.000Z	jusama14	dager	which are appropriate? lol
2007-03-10T12:01:00.000Z	dager	jusama14	get the "i386" ones
2007-03-10T12:01:00.000Z	dager	jusama14	im assuming.. if you're on a 64-bit processor or a PPC, get the ones labelled as such
2007-03-10T12:02:00.000Z	dager	jusama14	kernel, not kernal :)
2007-03-10T12:17:00.000Z	dager	jusama14	yes?
