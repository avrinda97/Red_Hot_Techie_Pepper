2008-01-31T18:30:00.000Z	jrib	srujan	you need to reboot and choose "recovery mode" from the grub menu.  Then execute, without the quotes, 'adduse YOUR_USER_NAME', where YOUR_USER_NAME is your actual user name.  After that, reboot and use the GUI (System -> Adiministration -> Users and Groups) to add yourself to your other missing groups.
2008-01-31T18:30:00.000Z	jrib	srujan	ack, I made a typo.  The command should be: adduser YOUR_USER_NAME
2008-01-31T18:31:00.000Z	jrib	srujan	ack, I made a typo.  The command should be: adduser YOUR_USER_NAME admin
2008-01-31T18:31:00.000Z	jrib	srujan	one should say "recovery mode".  What 5 do you see?
2008-01-31T18:32:00.000Z	jrib	srujan	reboot and check.  It should be there unless you have removed it
2008-01-31T18:33:00.000Z	jrib	srujan	k, come back if it's not there
2008-01-31T18:34:00.000Z	jrib	srujan	a line that says "recovery mode" somewhere
2008-01-31T18:34:00.000Z	jrib	srujan	and then run the 'adduser YOUR_USER_NAME admin' command
2008-01-31T18:35:00.000Z	jrib	srujan	you don't need one.  It is listed by default
2008-01-31T18:36:00.000Z	srujan	jrib	ok what will be displayed after the recovery booting? a direct command line ar anything else/
2008-01-31T18:37:00.000Z	jrib	srujan	mine is displayed as: Ubuntu 7.10, kernel 2.6.22-14-generic (recovery mode).  You just select that and hit enter.  Then you get a command prompt.  You enter 'adduser YOUR_USER_NAME admin', where YOUR_USER_NAME is your actual username.  Then reboot
2008-01-31T18:38:00.000Z	jrib	srujan	come back if you have trouble :)
