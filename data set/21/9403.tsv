2006-03-28T08:29:00.000Z	useruser	_jason	that doesn't work on hoary, by the way
2006-03-28T08:29:00.000Z	_jason	useruser	interesting... didn't know that
2006-03-28T08:29:00.000Z	useruser	_jason	at least, it's not on the live cd i'm running
2006-03-28T08:30:00.000Z	_jason	useruser	can you 'cat cat /etc/lsb-release' ?
2006-03-28T08:31:00.000Z	_jason	useruser	oops, one cat too many there
2006-03-28T08:31:00.000Z	useruser	_jason	yeah, that works
2006-03-28T08:31:00.000Z	useruser	_jason	oh, ignore me. i was typing lsb-release instead of lsb_release :)
2006-03-28T08:32:00.000Z	_jason	useruser	I changed it once and it just caused problems, you are better off keeping it with the shift
2006-03-28T08:32:00.000Z	useruser	_jason	it's not that, i just can't follow basic instructions :P
2006-03-31T08:07:00.000Z	_jason	useruser	did you check the md5sum ?
2006-03-31T08:08:00.000Z	useruser	_jason	i checked the md5sum of the iso. i'm in the process of checking the md5sum of each file on the dvd
2006-03-31T08:08:00.000Z	_jason	useruser	just check the md5sum of the disk
2006-03-31T08:08:00.000Z	useruser	_jason	how?
2006-03-31T08:09:00.000Z	useruser	_jason	thanks, i'll take a look
2006-03-31T09:02:00.000Z	useruser	_jason	any ideas?
2006-03-31T09:03:00.000Z	_jason	useruser	and the normal cd boots fine?
2006-03-31T09:03:00.000Z	useruser	_jason	well i've been using a hoary live cd which works fine
2006-03-31T09:03:00.000Z	_jason	useruser	that's really strange, no idea sorry
2006-03-31T09:03:00.000Z	useruser	_jason	ok, thanks anyway
2006-04-01T08:01:00.000Z	_jason	useruser	system > admin > services
2006-04-01T08:01:00.000Z	useruser	_jason	ok, not in hoary it seems
