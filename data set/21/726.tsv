2012-04-10T21:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	LmtdAt	you should be able to nautilus>files>connect to server>windows share>pick system
2012-04-10T21:24:00.000Z	LmtdAt	sacarlson	I had already done that using "Browse Network", but where is it mounted?
2012-04-10T21:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	LmtdAt	it will mount in /media/??
2012-04-10T21:25:00.000Z	LmtdAt	sacarlson	hmm, brb.
2012-04-10T21:26:00.000Z	LmtdAt	sacarlson	I don't see it in /media or /mnt
2012-04-10T21:26:00.000Z	LmtdAt	sacarlson	How do I get nautilus to tell me where I'm browsing!?
2012-04-10T21:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	LmtdAt	I'm not sure then,  what is the default mount for nautilus?
2012-04-10T21:27:00.000Z	LmtdAt	sacarlson	checking http://kwlug.org/node/725
2012-04-10T21:28:00.000Z	LmtdAt	sacarlson	Okay, I found it.  I don't want it there ^_^
2012-04-10T21:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	LmtdAt	I think it's /home/your_user_name/.gvfs
2012-04-10T21:28:00.000Z	LmtdAt	sacarlson	That's what the article says.
2012-04-10T21:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	LmtdAt	if you don't want it there you can symbolic link it to anther location but it will still also be there
2012-04-10T21:30:00.000Z	LmtdAt	sacarlson	That's not terrible...  I'm going to have to do this every time I log on, right?  I feel like there ought to be a command-line way of doing this.
2012-04-10T21:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	LmtdAt	oh if you want it permanent I guess you will want to look into adding it into fstab or other method
2012-04-10T21:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	LmtdAt	I'm not sure I would want a samba conection in fstab as if it fails to mount it will stall boot untill it time out
