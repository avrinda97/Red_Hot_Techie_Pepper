2012-10-21T23:34:00.000Z	Zw33t		as far as i know
2012-10-21T23:34:00.000Z	Zw33t		users on the computer?
2012-10-21T23:35:00.000Z	Zw33t		sorry I am not as good at this yet as you noticed, but tnx for help :-)
2012-10-21T23:35:00.000Z	Zw33t		what i meen is, i need to have chmod 777 etc on many files
2012-10-21T23:35:00.000Z	Zw33t		but i dont want users on the server to have access to see all folders and files
2012-10-21T23:36:00.000Z	Zw33t		Most files on my server has 775
2012-10-21T23:36:00.000Z	Zw33t		or folders*
2012-10-21T23:37:00.000Z	Zw33t		sould i say?
2012-10-21T23:38:00.000Z	Zw33t		But if the files has a owner, does 775 makes it open for others?
2012-10-21T23:38:00.000Z	Zw33t		its 775 by default
2012-10-21T23:38:00.000Z	overclucker	Zw33t	try 770 for directories, 5 is read + execute which allows directory traversal
2012-10-21T23:38:00.000Z	Zw33t	bekks	folders are 775 *
2012-10-21T23:39:00.000Z	Zw33t		hmm ok
2012-10-21T23:39:00.000Z	Zw33t		il change to that then
2012-10-21T23:39:00.000Z	Zw33t		but the think is, iff il do a "adduser bekks" you get a user, and a home folder
2012-10-21T23:39:00.000Z	Zw33t		but you can still access files above /home/bekks
2012-10-21T23:40:00.000Z	Zw33t		but as i said, i do not want them to have access to all folders, but they can now. Thats why i was thinking of chroot jail.
2012-10-21T23:41:00.000Z	Zw33t		I just want the user bekks that i add to have access to his own /home/ folder , and some folders in /home/otheruser/
2012-10-21T23:41:00.000Z	Zw33t		the thing is that i have a game on a user /home/game , and i want do add some people that can access /home/game/addons folder.
2012-10-21T23:42:00.000Z	Zw33t		but i dont want them to see all files on the server
2012-10-21T23:42:00.000Z	overclucker	Zw33t	755 still allows other users to traverse the directories. try 750, then add users you want to be able to access it to the game group
