2005-12-28T13:59:00.000Z	jennhi	Sh4d0x	it's requiring xine-lib and xine-d5d, which aren't available from apt-get and I can't compile them for some reason.
2005-12-28T14:00:00.000Z	Sh4d0x	jennhi	maybe you can found them on the web and try to install them manually
2005-12-28T14:02:00.000Z	Sh4d0x	jennhi	hmm let me give it a try
