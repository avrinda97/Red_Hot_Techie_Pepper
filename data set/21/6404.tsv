2007-04-09T11:31:00.000Z	Pugwash		hey guys, I gotta question,
2007-04-09T11:31:00.000Z	Pugwash		gnome-system-monitor says I've got 2 xorgs running, is that normal
2007-04-09T11:33:00.000Z	Pugwash		?
2007-04-09T11:34:00.000Z	Pugwash		anybody know if that's normal?
2007-04-09T11:35:00.000Z	Pugwash		I've not noticed 2 Xorgs running before, just noticed it today in conky, they're taking up 74 mb each
2007-04-09T11:36:00.000Z	Pugwash		ok, so its not normal then?
2007-04-09T11:37:00.000Z	Pugwash		it is?
2007-04-09T11:37:00.000Z	Pugwash		ok, let me just kill it, how do i start xserver  if it goes tits up
2007-04-09T11:38:00.000Z	aubade	Pugwash	Assuming you have a login manager running, GDM/KDM should just restart... or one would hope. lol
2007-04-09T11:38:00.000Z	Pugwash		kk, I've just tried to kill one of em through gsm and its not going
2007-04-09T11:39:00.000Z	aubade		^ lol
2007-04-09T11:40:00.000Z	Pugwash		killing the other one restarted my xsession
2007-04-09T11:41:00.000Z	Pugwash		had to login again
2007-04-09T11:41:00.000Z	Pugwash		no, on of them refuses to be killed, the other one killed my session
2007-04-09T11:41:00.000Z	aubade	Pugwash	Yeah, GDM daemon restarted Xorg itself. Weird that it had two instances but it isn't unusual for a program to have multiple PIDs.
2007-04-09T11:42:00.000Z	Pugwash		ah it could be that, multiple pids
2007-04-09T11:42:00.000Z	aubade		Firefox itself is spread across six PID's atm, for instance.
2007-04-09T11:42:00.000Z	Pugwash		how do I check if its the same program?
2007-04-09T11:43:00.000Z	aubade		No idea, if the resource usage (proc %, RES/SHR memory) are the same, it's probably spread.
2007-04-09T11:43:00.000Z	Pugwash		how do i check pid file, sorry
2007-04-09T11:44:00.000Z	Pugwash	aubade	they're both taking up 3.22% of my memory
