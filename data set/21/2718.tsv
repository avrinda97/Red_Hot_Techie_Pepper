2009-07-23T04:28:00.000Z	losher	Alvinware	that said, I've never seen a report of wine being infected. I think because wine users don't surf from inside wine as a rule...
2009-07-23T04:37:00.000Z	losher	Alvinware	most of us don't consider the ability to pass on a virus as a good thing :-)
2009-07-23T04:39:00.000Z	Alvinware	losher	but that's all the servers running in unix/linux do every days by passing those nasty things to windows client, and got them infected, because they don't stop it.
2009-07-23T04:42:00.000Z	Alvinware	losher	got winlux?
2009-07-23T04:42:00.000Z	Alvinware	losher	winlux/winux?
2009-07-23T04:43:00.000Z	losher	Alvinware	googling it now...
2009-07-23T04:44:00.000Z	Alvinware	losher	gnome is a x windows server? can i use kde in ubuntu, and switch between them?
2009-07-23T04:46:00.000Z	losher	Alvinware	you can use either. And there are dozens more if you don't like those...
2009-07-23T04:49:00.000Z	losher	Alvinware	winlux appears to be a news site. Was there something specific you wanted me to see there?
2009-07-23T04:50:00.000Z	Alvinware	losher	no, i'm just thinking of combining linux, and windows into a new os.
2009-07-23T04:51:00.000Z	losher	Alvinware	good luck with that....
2009-07-23T05:09:00.000Z	losher	Alvinware	ProfOak: getting seriously off-topic guys....
2009-07-23T05:10:00.000Z	losher	Alvinware	ProfOak: take it to #ubuntu-offtopic please if you want to continue...
2009-07-23T05:11:00.000Z	losher	Alvinware	drop it, or move it. Or risk being bounced....
2009-07-23T05:12:00.000Z	losher	Alvinware	an operator can ban you. Very easily...
2009-07-23T05:15:00.000Z	losher	Alvinware	even if you change ip & username, if you come back talking about the same off-topic, we'll catch on. We're not *that* dumb...
2009-07-23T05:16:00.000Z	Alvinware	losher	of-course, uallnotdumpguys, lol, me too. :-D
2009-07-23T05:19:00.000Z	losher	Alvinware	the ban doesn't last for long. Just long enough to discourage bad behavior
2009-08-03T01:54:00.000Z	losher	Alvinware	I've never heard of it. More importantly. neither apparently has google. Got any context?
2009-08-03T01:55:00.000Z	Alvinware	losher	My friend said it was from Japan, and it's a hardware for computer,it hide the owner I.P..
2009-08-03T01:57:00.000Z	losher	Alvinware	I still don't see anything that fits in google. Could you have translated it wrong? At this point it's starting to look very off-topic
