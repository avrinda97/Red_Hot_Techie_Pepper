2005-07-02T07:09:00.000Z	bob2	devios	that package doesn't seem to be in ubuntu
2005-07-02T07:31:00.000Z	bob2	devios	that's not in ubuntu
2005-07-02T07:32:00.000Z	bob2	devios	talk to whoever made it
2005-07-02T07:34:00.000Z	devios	bob2	it's in synaptic...
2005-07-02T07:34:00.000Z	bob2	devios	yet not in ubuntu
2005-07-02T07:34:00.000Z	bob2	devios	paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to #flood
2005-07-02T07:36:00.000Z	devios	bob2	done
2005-07-02T07:36:00.000Z	bob2	devios	so, the last two lines aren't actually ubuntu packages
2005-07-02T07:37:00.000Z	bob2	devios	my apologies, I'm wrong
2005-07-02T07:38:00.000Z	devios	bob2	nbd.  are you correct about what you said about the last two lines of my sources.list file?
2005-07-02T07:38:00.000Z	bob2	devios	yeah, they're backports, not official ubuntu packages
2005-07-02T07:39:00.000Z	bob2	devios	they're development versions of packages compiled on ubuntu stable
2005-07-02T07:39:00.000Z	bob2	devios	I would suspect that's the reason gaim-encryption is doing that; afaict, the one in hoary won't remove either of those packages
2005-07-02T07:43:00.000Z	devios	bob2	I am using hoary.  Should I comment out the backports lines?
2005-07-02T07:43:00.000Z	bob2	devios	yes
2005-07-02T07:44:00.000Z	devios	bob2	I'll give it a shot...
2005-07-02T07:57:00.000Z	devios	bob2	thanks.  basically, I should only uncomment the backports repositories when I am 1) looking for a package that isn't in the official? repositories, or 2) when I have to have the latest version of a particular package for some reason, and the latest version isn't available in the official? repositories.  Am I understanding this correctly?
2005-07-02T07:57:00.000Z	bob2	devios	yes
2005-07-02T11:24:00.000Z	bob2	devios	er, it starts by default...
2005-07-02T11:24:00.000Z	devios	bob2	it does.  I had to change the port it listened on, so I stopped it
2005-07-02T11:25:00.000Z	devios	bob2	and then forgot to sudo when restarting it
