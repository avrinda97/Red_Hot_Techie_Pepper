2008-06-15T18:46:00.000Z	eyes`only	Blinkiz	a .bin would not be a 1:1 copy
2008-06-15T18:47:00.000Z	eyes`only	Blinkiz	.bin has crc info, much larger than 1:1 copy
2008-06-15T18:47:00.000Z	Blinkiz	eyes`only	okay. So Brasero did not make a copy? What did Brasero do then?
2008-06-15T18:48:00.000Z	eyes`only	Blinkiz	well, bin usually has a cue with it.. does it have that?
2008-06-15T18:48:00.000Z	Blinkiz	eyes`only	No, it has the toc file that I pasted into pastebin. Se my message above for reference
2008-06-15T18:49:00.000Z	Blinkiz	eyes`only	My toc file is here http://pastebin.com/d2127c150. So, can I mount this in some way? Convert it?
2008-06-15T18:52:00.000Z	eyes`only	Blinkiz	no, because that doesnt look like a cue file at all!
2008-06-15T18:53:00.000Z	Blinkiz	eyes`only	So Brasero is using some kind of internal layout for it's 1:1 copy? I can only burn this to a real CD?!
2008-06-15T18:55:00.000Z	eyes`only	Blinkiz	checking... all docs say that brasero's default format is .iso
2008-06-15T18:56:00.000Z	Blinkiz	eyes`only	Maybe Brasero only uses ISO as format if it's a data cd? This is a audio cd. Maybe it's something special with that?
2008-06-15T18:57:00.000Z	eyes`only	Blinkiz	ok i see... brasero uses .toc (cdrdao) for audio. researching

2008-06-15T19:00:00.000Z	eyes`only	Blinkiz	my suggestion would be to burn to cd-rw, then reimage to .iso
2008-06-15T19:01:00.000Z	eyes`only	Blinkiz	brasero only saves to .toc if you select 'automatic' for file type. you can override that and select .iso
2008-06-15T19:02:00.000Z	Blinkiz	eyes`only	aha, thanks for letting me know. Okay, gonna try this bin/toc link converting you gave me a link about. brb
2008-06-15T19:22:00.000Z	Blinkiz	eyes`only	Thanks for all the help. It does not seems like ubuntu/linux can handle audio bin file with a toc file. Sad... Am forced to burn the bin file to a real CD and then copy it again with another tool that creates a regular iso file.
2008-06-15T19:23:00.000Z	eyes`only	Blinkiz	exactly what i suggested ;)
2008-06-15T19:23:00.000Z	Blinkiz	eyes`only	Am gonna look for a toc to cue converter. That will probably be the only solution here
2008-06-15T19:24:00.000Z	eyes`only	Blinkiz	burn then create iso with brasero
2008-06-15T19:29:00.000Z	eyes`only	Blinkiz	you dont need to 'find another burning tool', brasero will do .iso but you have to select it
