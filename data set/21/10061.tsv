2005-05-22T16:08:00.000Z	devilhorns		so I could do apt-build with ubuntu...can I set some compiler flags somewhere ?
2005-05-22T16:09:00.000Z	toresbe	devilhorns	yes
2005-05-22T16:09:00.000Z	toresbe	devilhorns	but why do you want to?
2005-05-22T16:09:00.000Z	devilhorns	toresbe	is ubuntu compiled for i386 arch ?
2005-05-22T16:09:00.000Z	toresbe	devilhorns	yes...
2005-05-22T16:10:00.000Z	devilhorns	toresbe	well I'd like to have it optimized for my machine (ie: not i386)
2005-05-22T16:10:00.000Z	toresbe	devilhorns	uhm, i386 refers to the 386 memory system - aka IA32.
2005-05-22T16:10:00.000Z	devilhorns	toresbe	then is ubuntu optimized for what processor ?
2005-05-22T16:11:00.000Z	toresbe	devilhorns	Processor-dependant optimizations are a *myth*
2005-05-22T16:11:00.000Z	toresbe	devilhorns	The exception being floating-point-heavy stuff.
2005-05-22T16:11:00.000Z	devilhorns	toresbe	ok, but is ubuntu compiled for i386 like redhat ?
2005-05-22T16:11:00.000Z	toresbe	devilhorns	but some of these feature runtime detection.
2005-05-22T16:12:00.000Z	toresbe	devilhorns	it is compiled for the intel 386-and-up processors, yes
2005-05-22T16:13:00.000Z	toresbe	devilhorns	"i386" just refers to the 32-bit processor architechture Intel introduced together with the 386
2005-05-22T16:14:00.000Z	devilhorns	toresbe	yea, but would rather have stuff compiled for i686...where would I set compiler flags in ubuntu ?
2005-05-22T16:14:00.000Z	toresbe	devilhorns	*sigh*
2005-05-22T16:14:00.000Z	toresbe	devilhorns	i686 *is* an i386 processor
2005-05-22T16:15:00.000Z	toresbe	devilhorns	there are *very few* added instructions that differentiate it from the 386
2005-05-22T16:16:00.000Z	toresbe	devilhorns	those that are (the MMX, MMX2, SSE, SSE2, 3DNow!, 3DNow! 2 instruction sets) are usually explicitly tested for by most applications
2005-05-22T16:16:00.000Z	devilhorns	toresbe	ok
2005-05-22T16:16:00.000Z	toresbe	devilhorns	The performance gained by explicitly telling GCC to compile for 686 are truly trivial
