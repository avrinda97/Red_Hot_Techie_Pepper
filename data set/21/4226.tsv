2008-07-05T09:37:00.000Z	leemajors		anyone know why my mouse would just stop working all the time?
2008-07-05T09:38:00.000Z	bloodrock	leemajors	possible hardware conflict/
2008-07-05T09:39:00.000Z	leemajors	bloodrock	the logs seem to suggest that also, any idea how i  might fix it?
2008-07-05T09:40:00.000Z	bloodrock	leemajors	find which hardware is  useing same irq and try and set it to a different irq

2008-07-05T09:43:00.000Z	bloodrock	leemajors	is the logitech a multi usb port
2008-07-05T09:44:00.000Z	leemajors	bloodrock	no, the logitech is the mouse -- it's a wireless logitech laser mouse
2008-07-05T09:50:00.000Z	bloodrock	leemajors	shows it disconnecting and reconnecting prob not a conflict  not sure might check that battery isn't loose or receiver in the usb socket loose
2008-07-05T09:50:00.000Z	bloodrock	leemajors	i'm assuming your useing a laptop
2008-07-05T09:51:00.000Z	leemajors	bloodrock	yep, a dell inspiron 8600
2008-07-05T09:53:00.000Z	leemajors	bloodrock	the mouse is plugged directly into one of the 2 main usb ports, and the other is taken up by a powered 7-port hub, mostly filled with external HDDs
2008-07-05T09:54:00.000Z	bloodrock	leemajors	 or battery may be low and the signal gets blocked it for sure is connecting and recionnecting according to your pastebin
2008-07-05T09:54:00.000Z	leemajors	bloodrock	battery is freshly charged...
2008-07-05T09:55:00.000Z	leemajors	bloodrock	how do you change the IRQ of a device?
2008-07-05T09:57:00.000Z	bloodrock	leemajors	irq don't much matter on usb
2008-07-05T09:58:00.000Z	leemajors	bloodrock	hmm, so you have any more ideas?
2008-07-05T10:00:00.000Z	bloodrock	leemajors	does it seem to get lost in a certain are or position ?
2008-07-05T10:02:00.000Z	leemajors	bloodrock	hmm, i haven't noticed. that one could take me days to diagnose :) however when the mouse stops working I can just switch right on over to the touchpad which works fine, and i don't have this problem in windows..
2008-07-05T10:03:00.000Z	bloodrock	leemajors	 k that kinda answers my thinking if no prob in windows it not a position prob
2008-07-05T10:04:00.000Z	bloodrock	leemajors	 i'm blank on any other ideas sorry
2008-07-05T10:05:00.000Z	leemajors	bloodrock	it's cool, thanks for trying :)
