2009-05-29T19:50:00.000Z	dayo	boss_mc	third time's a charm ;-)
2009-05-29T19:51:00.000Z	boss_mc	dayo	ubottu is brill until you can't remember the command
2009-05-29T19:51:00.000Z	dayo	boss_mc	truth
2009-05-29T19:52:00.000Z	dayo	boss_mc	it's needs a googlish "Did you mean ...?" feature
2009-05-29T19:52:00.000Z	boss_mc	dayo	write one!
2009-05-29T19:52:00.000Z	dayo	boss_mc	where can i find ubottu's source? what's it written in?
2009-05-29T19:53:00.000Z	boss_mc	dayo	absolutely no idea....
2009-05-29T19:56:00.000Z	boss_mc	dayo	looks like we can just create/edit factoids on the fly...
2009-05-29T20:29:00.000Z	dayo	boss_mc	yeah it seems so, doesn't it?
2009-05-29T20:30:00.000Z	dayo	boss_mc	my reply is about a half hour late, btw.
2009-07-03T22:07:00.000Z	boss_mc	dayo	I did a standard upgrade
2009-07-03T22:08:00.000Z	boss_mc	dayo	worked fine except I'd accidentally removed the mesa graphics drivers...
2009-07-03T22:08:00.000Z	dayo	boss_mc	is it possible to do that with CD?
2009-07-03T22:08:00.000Z	boss_mc	dayo	but that was my fault
2009-07-03T22:08:00.000Z	boss_mc	dayo	you need the alternative CD for that
2009-07-03T22:09:00.000Z	dayo	boss_mc	hmm
2009-07-03T22:12:00.000Z	boss_mc	dayo	can't you do a net upgrade?
2009-07-03T22:13:00.000Z	dayo	boss_mc	not enough bandwidth for that, i'm afraid
