2012-02-10T20:33:00.000Z	uictamale		does anyone here know if the global app menu is here to stay?  I really think it makes using ubuntu a horrible experience, and using the 'hacks' to disable it all leave much to be desired.
2012-02-10T20:34:00.000Z	uictamale		for that matter, does anyone know if ALL of the 'OSX-esque' directions of ubuntu's design are here to stay, or are they a termporary thing?  Where can I voice my opinion in a constructive manner on the topic?
2012-02-10T20:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uictamale	my desktop looks nothing like OSX

2012-02-10T20:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uictamale	looks like OSX?
2012-02-10T20:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uictamale	looks more like Win7 if you ask me
2012-02-10T20:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uictamale	it's LXDE...
2012-02-10T20:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uictamale	you are talking about Unity, which is one part of the whole OS, you could use KDE and get a similar desktop to mine too
2012-02-10T20:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uictamale	it can and you would replace openbox with compiz. You can replace any WM with compiz
2012-02-10T20:37:00.000Z	uictamale	ActionParsnip	understood, but as far as I've been able to figure out, only unity keeps the compiz settings I've grown dependent on
2012-02-10T20:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uictamale	in brief, your view of the whole OS is based on one vERY CHANGABLE factor of it
2012-02-10T20:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uictamale	the whole 'i hate unity' thing has been goingon for months now, haven't you see the web pages on it. Its boring now
2012-02-10T20:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uictamale	it can be changed, its very simple
2012-02-10T20:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uictamale	I suggest you install xfce4 and use that, it feels and runs like Gnome2 and you can run youor gnome apps there with no issue
2012-02-10T20:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uictamale	you don't HAVE to use Unity
2012-02-10T20:40:00.000Z	uictamale	ActionParsnip	You're beating a dead horse - I know I don't have to use unity - I want to help shape unity's direction.
2012-02-10T20:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uictamale	then report bugs and suggest features...
2012-02-10T20:43:00.000Z	uictamale	ActionParsnip	Is installing LXDE as easy as installing a few packages?  Will is potentially harm any other packages?
2012-02-10T20:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uictamale	sudo apt-get install lxde
2012-02-10T20:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uictamale	it won't harm any other packages at all...
2012-02-10T20:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	uictamale	if you want the look mine has, install lubuntu-desktop instead   and you will get a different default theme than normal, the lubuntu one, which is what I have
