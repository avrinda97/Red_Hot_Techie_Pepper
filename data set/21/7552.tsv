2007-04-10T16:30:00.000Z	silverfox	Yonith	You run nvidia or ati?
2007-04-10T16:30:00.000Z	silverfox	Yonith	your in a shell now then i guess?
2007-04-10T16:31:00.000Z	silverfox	Yonith	do 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf' and scroll down to the bit about your graphics card and under driver it should say "nv" if not change it to that
2007-04-10T16:32:00.000Z	silverfox	Yonith	Dont install them ones
2007-04-10T16:32:00.000Z	silverfox	Yonith	They arent so great
2007-04-10T16:33:00.000Z	silverfox	Yonith	You havent installed it at all have you?
2007-04-10T16:33:00.000Z	silverfox	Yonith	Does your xorg.conf still read "nv"
2007-04-10T16:34:00.000Z	silverfox	Yonith	Dont assume things :P Just double check sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-04-10T16:46:00.000Z	silverfox	Yonith	Get anywhere?
2007-04-10T16:46:00.000Z	silverfox	Yonith	Nothing in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-04-10T16:48:00.000Z	silverfox	Yonith	If theres nothing at all inside /etc/X11/xorg.conf Umm lol!

2007-04-10T16:49:00.000Z	silverfox	Yonith	Did you actually install xserver?
2007-04-10T16:50:00.000Z	silverfox	Yonith	using sudo apt-get install xorg
2007-04-10T16:50:00.000Z	silverfox	Yonith	Theres your problem
