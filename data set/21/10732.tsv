2005-05-19T16:14:00.000Z	Seveas	Fator_Dee	you mean a fork()
2005-05-19T13:33:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Seveas	and you can include multimedia player to the list too :-)
2005-05-19T13:55:00.000Z	Seveas	Fator_Dee	use archive manager for that
2005-05-19T13:57:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Seveas	well it works (kind of) but you have to open every file separately :-\
2005-05-19T13:57:00.000Z	Seveas	Fator_Dee	can't nautilus look inzide compressed files (i dont use nautilus too much, so i could be telling rubbish here)
2005-05-19T14:00:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Seveas	and it seems nautilus can't see inside compressed files
