2006-05-27T09:31:00.000Z	KyoLptp`		I still don't get it
2006-05-27T09:31:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	pastebin the output
2006-05-27T09:27:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	what's the issue?
2006-05-27T09:27:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	do you have sound with ``aplay /usr/share/sounds/startup.wav''?
2006-05-27T09:29:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	so kill whatever's using the audio device.  ``lsof /dev/dsp* /dev/snd/*''
2006-05-27T09:29:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	(to get a list of processes)
2006-05-27T09:33:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	that's easy. bittornado is hogging the oss emulation device /dev/dsp, which is exclusive. If an app opens /dev/dsp, no other app can if your hardware doesn't natively support pcm multiplexing.
2006-05-27T09:33:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	so close bittornado.
2006-05-27T09:34:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	what device does youtube use?
2006-05-27T09:37:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	so close bittornado and restart youtube or whatever.
2006-05-27T09:52:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	what's the status?
2006-06-19T06:27:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	#1. ``sudo apt-get --purge remove flashplugin-nonfree''  #2. Download the install.tar.gz from Macromedia's/Adobe's Web site (follow the Download> Players links)  #3. ``sudo apt-get --reinstall install flashplugin-nonfree'' but choose NO when prompted to download from the Internet
2006-06-19T06:28:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	#4. ``sudo update-flashplugin --local-file $dir_containing_the_install.tar.gz''
2006-06-19T06:28:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	pay attention to step #4: it's the /directory/ not the path to the install.tar.gz
2006-06-19T06:33:00.000Z	KyoLptp`	crimsun	the install tar is on the desktop
2006-06-19T06:33:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	did you use step #4 that I gave you above?
2006-06-19T06:40:00.000Z	KyoLptp`	crimsun	why did you put that "$" sign there?
2006-06-19T06:40:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	because it's the standard designation for a variable
2006-06-19T06:43:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	asking questions is viable, too.
2006-06-19T06:43:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	the entire procedure is documented in bug 48620
2006-06-19T06:45:00.000Z	crimsun	KyoLptp`	np
