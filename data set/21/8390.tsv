2008-09-05T09:07:00.000Z	Tempusrname		Hey i have a problem when i removed a UBUNTU harddrive from one machine and put it in another machine to boot
2008-09-05T09:08:00.000Z	Tempusrname		when i put a existing harddrive with ubuntu 7.10 installed into another box and booted it would boot find till it got to running local scrips it would just stay there and not move further in the boot. Should i reconfigure xorg?

2008-09-05T09:11:00.000Z	AAA	Tempusrname	 does that create a new file in the /tmp dir?
2008-09-05T09:12:00.000Z	AAA	Tempusrname	 ok, you are prolly mounted in read-only mode
