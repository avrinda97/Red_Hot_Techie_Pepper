2005-07-12T12:47:00.000Z	Monteiro		i have some problems in ubuntu, my memory gets full very quickly and when i execute programs my mouse sometimes freezes in a second, anyone knows how i can resolve this problem ?
2005-07-12T12:48:00.000Z	Monteiro		Elmo : gnome :)
2005-07-12T12:49:00.000Z	delire	Monteiro	check the swap space is being used, with 'top'. if not ensure swap is actually being used with 'swapon'
2005-07-12T12:51:00.000Z	Monteiro	delire	: in a 2GB swapspace it uses 150 megas of swapspace
2005-07-12T12:51:00.000Z	delire	Monteiro	wowo, why so much swap in the first place?
2005-07-12T12:52:00.000Z	Monteiro	delire	Elmo : yes, but that don't change the exagerate use of the swap
2005-07-12T12:52:00.000Z	delire	Monteiro	i would check you have DMA on for that disk with 'sudo hdparm -d /dev/yourhardisk'
2005-07-12T12:53:00.000Z	delire	Monteiro	be careful with hdparm, without anything after that '-d' it will simply output the DMA status of the disk
2005-07-12T12:53:00.000Z	delire	Monteiro	with 'hdparm -d /dev/hda' here i get the output: " using_dma    =  1 (on)" which is good.
2005-07-12T12:53:00.000Z	Monteiro	delire	: i've dma enabled in my disk, ubuntu enables it by default
2005-07-12T12:54:00.000Z	delire	Monteiro	just check
2005-07-12T12:54:00.000Z	Monteiro	delire	: i've checked
2005-07-12T12:54:00.000Z	delire	Monteiro	ok, then i don't have much idea. hey don't get too hung up on 'top' by the way, it's a bit illusory. here i am using "Swap:  1550232k total" which is normal
2005-07-12T12:56:00.000Z	Monteiro	delire	: do u think it is because of the 2GB swapspace ? maybe i should rezise to 512 ?
2005-07-12T12:56:00.000Z	delire	Monteiro	is your system slow?
2005-07-12T12:56:00.000Z	delire	Monteiro	use hdparm to check for write speeds.
2005-07-12T12:57:00.000Z	delire	Monteiro	'hdparm -t /dev/yourhardisk'
2005-07-12T12:57:00.000Z	Monteiro	delire	: 28 mb/s
2005-07-12T12:58:00.000Z	delire	Monteiro	i get: Timing buffered disk reads:   68 MB in  3.03 seconds =  22.4
2005-07-12T12:59:00.000Z	Monteiro	delire	: i was using T , it's 60 MB in  3.02 seconds =  19.88 MB/sec
2005-07-12T13:01:00.000Z	Monteiro	delire	: going to lunch see ya
