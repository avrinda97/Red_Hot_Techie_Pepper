2007-01-25T14:49:00.000Z	SurfnKid		wow
2007-01-25T14:49:00.000Z	SurfnKid		the gods heard you
2007-01-25T14:50:00.000Z	SurfnKid		I have a questiona about ssh
2007-01-25T14:50:00.000Z	SurfnKid		lets say i have 2 computers, I log in to one from another, and I quit the client. does the server stay on the other one? and where is the session at? how can I find it?
2007-01-25T14:50:00.000Z	m1r4g3	SurfnKid	if you want to keep your session, i recommend you to use "screen"
2007-01-25T14:51:00.000Z	SurfnKid	m1r4g3	lets say for instance I dont actually quit, but I close the cli window in gnome. does the session stay?
2007-01-25T14:51:00.000Z	m1r4g3	SurfnKid	your session is lost
2007-01-25T14:52:00.000Z	SurfnKid	m1r4g3	but not with screen
2007-01-25T14:52:00.000Z	SurfnKid	m1r4g3	do i run screen before I log in thru ssh or after?
2007-01-25T14:52:00.000Z	m1r4g3	SurfnKid	screen emulates a terminal after you log in with ssh
2007-01-25T14:53:00.000Z	SurfnKid	m1r4g3	ohh run screen on the server, and itll stay i see
2007-01-25T14:56:00.000Z	SurfnKid	m1r4g3	ssh>screen>irssi   now I can close it and screen>irssi will stay
2007-01-25T14:56:00.000Z	SurfnKid	m1r4g3	could I login to the same session?
2007-01-25T14:57:00.000Z	SurfnKid	m1r4g3	relogin thru ssh
2007-01-25T14:57:00.000Z	m1r4g3	SurfnKid	screen is for command line apps
2007-01-25T15:00:00.000Z	m1r4g3	SurfnKid	yes if you read the screen manual
2007-01-25T15:01:00.000Z	SurfnKid	m1r4g3	i got it! screen -x heh
2007-01-25T15:01:00.000Z	m1r4g3	SurfnKid	screen -r <pid> also
2007-01-25T15:02:00.000Z	m1r4g3	SurfnKid	and screen -ls gives you the open sockets
2007-01-25T15:40:00.000Z	SurfnKid	m1r4g3	ok thanks Ill try that
2007-01-25T15:40:00.000Z	m1r4g3	SurfnKid	cya
