2005-09-24T16:10:00.000Z	CarlFK		who did the Ubuntu hardware database wizard thing?
2005-09-24T16:10:00.000Z	crimsun	CarlFK	ogra did iirc
2006-07-28T10:31:00.000Z	CarlFK	crimsun	(or any other sound experts) which of these 2 cards would you recommend?  1. Aureal Semiconductor AU8810 Vortex Digital Audio Processor  2. Ensoniq ES1371 [AudioPCI-97] 
2006-07-28T11:40:00.000Z	crimsun	CarlFK	frankly, (2) [ensoniq] 
2006-07-28T11:40:00.000Z	crimsun	CarlFK	although if you had to get any card, an audigy 2 zs would suffice for nearly anything
2006-07-28T11:43:00.000Z	CarlFK	crimsun	thanks
2008-01-17T10:32:00.000Z	crimsun	CarlFK	sudo lsof /dev/dsp* /dev/audio* /dev/mixer* /dev/snd/*
2008-01-17T10:36:00.000Z	crimsun	CarlFK	that's normal.  That's the speaker icon (mixer applet) in the right of the top panel.
2008-01-17T10:36:00.000Z	crimsun	CarlFK	what's the issue?
2008-01-17T10:36:00.000Z	CarlFK	crimsun	ok.  mplayer sound.wav works.  play sound.wav doesn't
2008-01-17T10:37:00.000Z	crimsun	CarlFK	play, from sox?
2008-01-17T10:38:00.000Z	crimsun	CarlFK	does `aplay /usr/share/sounds/*up.wav`?
2008-01-17T10:38:00.000Z	CarlFK	crimsun	yes
2008-01-17T10:39:00.000Z	CarlFK	crimsun	 aplay same error as play: ALSA lib confmisc.c:769:(parse_card) cannot find card 'ï¿½WoPCI'
2008-01-17T10:40:00.000Z	crimsun	CarlFK	do you have an ~/.asoundrc and/or /etc/asound.conf ?
2008-01-17T10:43:00.000Z	crimsun	CarlFK	meaning, if you have either, try removing it/them
2008-01-17T10:44:00.000Z	CarlFK	crimsun	ill try removing - do I need to restart anything after removing?
2008-01-17T10:44:00.000Z	crimsun	CarlFK	no, just restart the alsa apps
2008-01-17T10:45:00.000Z	CarlFK	crimsun	that worked.  aplay played.
2008-01-17T10:46:00.000Z	crimsun	CarlFK	what addition issues did you have with alsa?
2008-01-17T10:47:00.000Z	CarlFK	crimsun	this started when I was trying to use Ekiga SIP phone.  the wizard had a test button, i hit it and got error dialogs.  so trying to figure out what the problem was.
