2007-05-08T10:47:00.000Z	Vistasux		hey whats the touch command do?
2007-05-08T10:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	depends.  It'll create a file, or update the timestamp on the file.
2007-05-08T11:39:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	Feisty or Edgy/Dapper?
2007-05-08T11:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	sudo apt-get remove --purge apache2 apache2.2-common apache2-mpm-worker
2007-05-08T11:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	please don't paste.  Do you have another package manager running?
2007-05-08T11:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	You'll need to wait for that to finish (or close it if its not doing anything) before using apt-get
2007-05-08T11:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	Eh?  What?  Yes.  Notreally "ontop"
2007-05-08T11:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	"apache2" didn't remove anything important.  You need to remove "apache2.2-common", why are you shuffling all this stuff?
2007-05-08T11:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	why are you wanting to reinstall apache?  (why not just keep installed?)  did you break the configuration?
2007-05-08T11:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	sudo apt-get remove --purge apache2 apache2.2-common apache2-mpm-worker
2007-05-08T11:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	then after that's done, reinstall apache2, and apache2-mod-php5
2007-05-08T11:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	that's fine.
2007-05-08T11:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	what error did it give?
2007-05-08T11:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	paste it there
2007-05-08T11:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	pastebin the error it gave you.
2007-05-08T11:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	It gave you that error when you removed apache?
2007-05-08T11:50:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	do "sudo apache2ctl start", what does it say?
2007-05-08T11:53:00.000Z	Vistasux	Flannel	when i type localhost in firefox i see apache2 logo, however when i typr in 127.0.1.1 its gives me an error any idea?
2007-05-08T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	because localhost is 127.0.0.1
2007-05-08T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	that's probably a 192.168.X.X IP then, not 127.0.1.1
2007-05-08T14:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Vistasux	you don't want to enable the root password, if you want a root terminal, `sudo -i` will give you one
