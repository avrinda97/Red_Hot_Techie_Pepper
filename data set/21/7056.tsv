2006-12-07T13:09:00.000Z	SchalaBrandford		Im having trouble mounting a hard drive. i tried using the FAQ, but it failed me.  :( ive used sudo mount and the diskmounter script, but got nothin. :?
2006-12-07T13:10:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	to mount something, you need to know the device node, and the mount point. Do you know those for sure already?
2006-12-07T13:11:00.000Z	SchalaBrandford	dabaR	i know its /dev/hdc1/ and /home/schala/desktop/documents
2006-12-07T13:12:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	reboot why?
2006-12-07T13:15:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	you want to rerun fstab mountings?
2006-12-07T13:16:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	ya, ^
2006-12-07T13:17:00.000Z	SchalaBrandford	dabaR	well, now the problem is that i reran the fstab and it STILL dosent work, lol
2006-12-07T13:18:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	you should post fstab, and output of sudo fdisk -l to paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-12-07T13:19:00.000Z	SchalaBrandford	dabaR	did that, but i dont think i fully understand the purpose.
2006-12-07T13:20:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	show me the URL, please.
2006-12-07T13:20:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	it helps me see information about the issue
2006-12-07T13:23:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	your kernel thinks it is ntfs, I do not want to contest it nor you. try http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35735/ as your fstab line, save, close the file then sudo mount -a/
2006-12-07T13:24:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	by sudo fdisk -l output
2006-12-07T13:29:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	oh, oh, you have " at the end of the fstab line?
2006-12-07T13:30:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	no, but it had that in your pastebin post.
2006-12-07T13:32:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	show output of mount on pastebin, please.
2006-12-07T13:32:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	just mount
2006-12-07T13:35:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	he did not get it.
2006-12-07T13:36:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	I am not sure why it will not mount, but the file system seems to be ntfs, sorry, it is not something I know what to do about.
2006-12-07T13:37:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	ya, or ask again later maybe someone will know.
2006-12-07T13:39:00.000Z	dabaR	SchalaBrandford	welcome.
