2010-03-31T07:06:00.000Z	switch10_		JeredH: I use rsync, it's reliable.
2010-03-31T07:06:00.000Z	JaredH	switch10_	how easy is it to recover your system from the backup..i mean in case of total collapse
2010-03-31T07:08:00.000Z	switch10_	JaredH	 simple as rsync -vlr --perms --stats /back/up/ /destination
2010-03-31T07:09:00.000Z	switch10_	JaredH	of course there are many other options you will want to look at.  --delete is a good one.  check out the man pages
2010-03-31T07:10:00.000Z	switch10_	JaredH	if you have rsync running as a cronjob, make sure its running in quiet mode
2010-03-31T07:12:00.000Z	JaredH	switch10_	I have been reading about all of the options in rsync and also other utilities for backing up/restoring data. What would you recommend for a linux newb?
2010-03-31T07:13:00.000Z	JaredH	switch10_	I can operate in Microsoft with some proficiency, but in Linux... I feel like a child again :)
2010-03-31T07:14:00.000Z	switch10_	JaredH	are you running a command line system?  Or do you have gnome or other desktop environments
2010-03-31T07:14:00.000Z	JaredH	switch10_	I am running gnome, but would like to learn more about the command line if it doesn't overload my brain too much
2010-03-31T07:16:00.000Z	switch10_	JaredH	I use this in a cron job to backup..  rsync -vrl --perms --delete --exclude '*~' --exclude 'Music' --exclude 'server' --exclude 'Downloads' --exclude 'Ubuntu One' --exclude 'Videos' --exclude '.VirtualBox' /home/dave/ /media/server/backup/desktop/dave
2010-03-31T07:17:00.000Z	JaredH	switch10_	what about your root?
2010-03-31T07:17:00.000Z	switch10_	JaredH	it is pretty straight forward, and you could always test it.  there is a dry run option
2010-03-31T07:17:00.000Z	switch10_	JaredH	I have no reason to backup /
2010-03-31T07:18:00.000Z	JaredH	switch10_	I wanted to backup everything necessary in root to restore the system to a functional place ... because I know I am going to crash it quite a bit while I'm still learning
2010-03-31T07:20:00.000Z	JaredH	switch10_	I have read about 15 different how to's and they are all different so I was hoping you guys could break it down for me a little
2010-03-31T07:21:00.000Z	switch10_	JaredH	Most people just backup /home because it has all of your settings, etc.  I find it unnecessary to back up the entire /.  maybe stuff you have possibly edited like /etc/fstab or /etc/apt/sources.list
2010-03-31T07:22:00.000Z	JaredH	switch10_	OK. Thanks. Do you know of a good HowTo to help me set it all up?
2010-03-31T07:23:00.000Z	switch10_	JaredH	you could also run something like, sudo dpkg --get-selections > /home/user/backup/installed_packages
2010-03-31T07:24:00.000Z	switch10_	JaredH	if all this is freaking you out, I suggest you use back-in-time to start out with.  It is very easy, and uses rsync.  But its a GUI.
2010-03-31T07:24:00.000Z	JaredH	switch10_	Could I pm you about something else?
2010-03-31T07:25:00.000Z	switch10_	JaredH	sure
