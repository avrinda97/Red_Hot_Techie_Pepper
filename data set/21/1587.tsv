2010-10-08T16:27:00.000Z	a5h15h		how to change the variable doc-view-continuous to a non-nil value in emacs?
2010-10-08T16:29:00.000Z	tensorpudding	a5h15h	M-x customize-variable, setq
2010-10-08T16:33:00.000Z	a5h15h	tensorpudding	the variable is not listed in the list(auto-completion list)?
2010-10-08T16:33:00.000Z	tensorpudding	a5h15h	it might not be set by default
2010-10-08T16:34:00.000Z	tensorpudding	a5h15h	try (setq <variable name> 1)
2010-10-08T16:36:00.000Z	a5h15h	tensorpudding	could you write the entire command?
2010-10-08T16:36:00.000Z	tensorpudding	a5h15h	I forgot the name of the variable you wanted to configure, but that was the whole thing
2010-10-08T16:37:00.000Z	tensorpudding	a5h15h	put it *scratch* and execute it for immediate effects, or put it in your .emacs to have it run every time you start emacs
2010-10-08T17:34:00.000Z	tensorpudding	a5h15h	run (setq doc-view-continuous t) in *scratch*, like i said before
2010-10-08T17:36:00.000Z	a5h15h	tensorpudding	how is it to be run?
2010-10-08T17:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding	a5h15h	open up the *scratch* buffer, put that code in, put the cursor right after the closing paren, then do C-j
2010-10-08T17:42:00.000Z	a5h15h	tensorpudding	k
2010-10-08T17:43:00.000Z	tensorpudding	a5h15h	it can also be added to the ~/.emacs file
2010-10-08T18:00:00.000Z	a5h15h	tensorpudding	it seems the variable "doc-view-continuous" was introduced in 23.2...i'm running 23.1.1
2010-10-08T18:06:00.000Z	tensorpudding	a5h15h	ah, too bad
2010-10-08T18:10:00.000Z	a5h15h	tensorpudding	thanks for the help...have a nice day
2010-10-08T18:15:00.000Z	tensorpudding	a5h15h	23.1.1 is the latest version available in ubuntu's packages
2010-10-08T18:15:00.000Z	tensorpudding	a5h15h	you'd have to track someone's ppa probably
2010-10-08T18:15:00.000Z	tensorpudding	a5h15h	or maybe emacs-snapshot
2010-10-08T18:16:00.000Z	tensorpudding	a5h15h	err, scratch that, emacs-snapshot is really out of date
