2006-10-28T07:16:00.000Z	ashl		how can i upgrade from dapper to edgy using a cd? i've apt-cdrom add'd in my edgy cd, apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade doesn't work though. what have i missed? (im using kubuntu)
2006-10-28T07:16:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ashl	did you comment out the other repos and just have the cdrom repo enabled
2006-10-28T07:17:00.000Z	ashl	gnomefreak	yeah
2006-10-28T07:17:00.000Z	ashl	gnomefreak	my sources.list only contains the cd...
2006-10-28T07:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ashl	is the cdrom edgy?
2006-10-28T07:17:00.000Z	ashl	gnomefreak	yup
2006-10-28T07:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ashl	the cd you have is edgy?
2006-10-28T07:18:00.000Z	ashl	gnomefreak	yes it's deffinitely edgy
2006-10-28T07:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ashl	does the md5sum match?
2006-10-28T07:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ashl	is the cd good?
2006-10-28T07:18:00.000Z	ashl	gnomefreak	yea on both
2006-10-28T07:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ashl	did you run sudo apt-get update?
2006-10-28T07:20:00.000Z	ashl	gnomefreak	is it perhaps because it's kubuntu, rather than ubuntu.... (obviously the different packages on the cd would modify the hash...)
2006-10-28T07:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ashl	the cd is the same that you have installed?
2006-10-28T07:21:00.000Z	ashl	gnomefreak	i've got  kubuntu dapper installed, trying to upgrade to edgy using a kubuntu edgy cd
2006-10-28T07:21:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ashl	and you ran the update command?
2006-10-28T07:21:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ashl	is this livecd or alternate?
2006-10-28T07:22:00.000Z	ashl	gnomefreak	it's the livecd
2006-10-28T07:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ashl	you cant use it to upgrade
2006-10-28T07:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ashl	just clean install you need alternate to upgrade
2006-10-28T07:22:00.000Z	ashl	gnomefreak	ah damnit, that explains a bit. thanks.
