2006-10-26T05:56:00.000Z	eric__		About five to ten minutes, tops.
2006-10-26T05:56:00.000Z	eric__		You might want to try #ubuntu-xgl for more info, helloyo
2006-10-26T05:57:00.000Z	eric__		No, not much sarcasm.  It's a pretty simple setup for dapper.
2006-10-26T05:57:00.000Z	eric__		Enjoy!
2006-10-26T05:57:00.000Z	eric__		Aiee, I can't use my keyboard in GUI.  I'm using IRSSI right now, something that I'm not perfectly familiar with - but it BEEPS any time I press a key.  Any suggestions?
2006-10-26T05:58:00.000Z	eric__		I'm using IRSSI, like I said.  It's just beeping at me in the GUI, on screen 7.
2006-10-26T05:58:00.000Z	soundray	eric__	try 'xset c off' just for sanity
2006-10-26T05:59:00.000Z	eric__	soundray	it says unable to open display
2006-10-26T05:59:00.000Z	soundray	eric__	try again from Alt-F2 run dialog
2006-10-26T06:00:00.000Z	eric__	soundray	- I'm on screen 1, logged into terminal - press alt f2 here?
2006-10-26T06:01:00.000Z	soundray	eric__	no, this needs to be done in X. Thought you said that X had messed it up.
2006-10-26T06:01:00.000Z	eric__	soundray	it is, and it just beeps at me, it won't let me press alt+f2 in the x.
2006-10-26T06:05:00.000Z	eric__		Nope, not making any progress.
2006-10-26T06:05:00.000Z	eric__		It's still just beeping at me.
2006-10-26T06:05:00.000Z	eric__		I think I'm going to have to do a full reboot - maybe?
2006-10-26T06:05:00.000Z	eric__		Gah, there goes my uptime.
2006-10-26T06:06:00.000Z	soundray	eric__	let me check this with you: you're in X right now, correct? Gnome?
2006-10-26T06:06:00.000Z	eric__	soundray	no, I'm on tty1, using IRSSI as my irc client
2006-10-26T06:06:00.000Z	eric__		!es
2006-10-26T06:06:00.000Z	eric__		Gotcha, Ljl :p
2006-10-26T06:07:00.000Z	soundray	eric__	yes, try a reboot.
