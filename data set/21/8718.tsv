2006-01-28T10:03:00.000Z	ashe		hello
2006-01-28T10:04:00.000Z	ashe		how do you compile programs using the live cd?
2006-01-28T10:05:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	With a compiler, like normal;. install one first.
2006-01-28T10:06:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	It's possible the ramdisk is filling up, yes.
2006-01-28T10:06:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	'df'
2006-01-28T10:06:00.000Z	ashe	cafuego	not full
2006-01-28T10:07:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	can you paste the error to the pastebin?
2006-01-28T10:07:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	can you paste the error to the pastebin?
2006-01-28T10:08:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	They come with the system, why are you compiling them?
2006-01-28T10:09:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	Ubuntu comes with wireless-utils and wpasupplicant. No compiling required.
2006-01-28T10:10:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	Yes, apt-get uses the network, eh?
2006-01-28T10:12:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	yes
2006-01-28T10:13:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	Yes, you can... depending on the wireless controller.
2006-01-28T10:13:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	But you WILL need to configure it.
2006-01-28T10:14:00.000Z	ashe	cafuego	how to configure wireless if I can't get to the packages?
2006-01-28T10:15:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	The packages are installed already.
2006-01-28T10:15:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	What wireless controller do you have?
2006-01-28T10:16:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	Ok. That one is not supported by default, yet.
2006-01-28T10:18:00.000Z	ashe	cafuego	but I should be able to use apt-get with 'net connectivity?
2006-01-28T10:19:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	Well, then I won't be able to help until you can actually somehow share the error message you get when you want to install build-essential.
2006-01-28T10:19:00.000Z	cafuego	ashe	'sudo apt-get update'
