2008-11-03T07:54:00.000Z	Pelo	daiv	blame MS
2008-11-03T07:54:00.000Z	daiv	Pelo	i'm sure it's MS or that the mouse is 5 or so years old
2008-11-03T07:54:00.000Z	Pelo	daiv	usb mouse ?
2008-11-03T07:54:00.000Z	Pelo	daiv	 have you given the forum a search for your mouse model ?
2008-11-03T07:54:00.000Z	daiv	Pelo	USB mouse, i bought it in 2001
2008-11-03T07:55:00.000Z	daiv	Pelo	It's a Microsoft Basic Optical Mouse
2008-11-03T07:55:00.000Z	Pelo	daiv	try a seperate usb port, they usualy come in pairs , try having your mouse on it's own pair ,
2008-11-03T07:56:00.000Z	daiv	Pelo	You read my mind, I'm moving it to the front  ;)
2008-11-03T07:57:00.000Z	Pelo	daiv	might now want to unplug and replug usb mouse whilethe comp is running
2008-11-03T07:57:00.000Z	daiv	Pelo	tried it, hard lock
2008-11-03T07:58:00.000Z	Pelo	daiv	sorry I meant might "not" want to . typo ,
