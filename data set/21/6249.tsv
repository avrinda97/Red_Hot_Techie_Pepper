2007-05-08T12:20:00.000Z	Punkunity	Madpilot	i dont see my printer here http://www.linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi?make=Dell
2007-05-08T12:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	Punkunity	hmm, not a good sign. not sure what to suggest
2007-05-08T12:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	Punkunity	what're you trying to install?
2007-05-08T12:35:00.000Z	Punkunity	Madpilot	i wanted that xdvdshrink or whatever and i downloaded it but  it wont install
2007-05-08T12:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	Punkunity	"sudo apt-get install dvdshrink" - you forgot the 'install'
2007-05-08T12:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	Punkunity	use Synaptic or Add/Remove to find packages, far easier than the command line
2007-05-08T12:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	Punkunity	then there won't be via apt-get either.
