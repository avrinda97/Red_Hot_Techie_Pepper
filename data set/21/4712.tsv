2008-02-29T17:06:00.000Z	inversekinetix		there are 4 partitions
2008-02-29T17:06:00.000Z	inversekinetix		there should be 5
2008-02-29T17:07:00.000Z	inversekinetix		shows it as empty ere4si
2008-02-29T17:09:00.000Z	inversekinetix		i did grub, but i use wingrub and a modified boot.ini
2008-02-29T17:09:00.000Z	inversekinetix		i had to reboot because everything borked
2008-02-29T17:11:00.000Z	inversekinetix		theres no problem with grub
2008-02-29T17:13:00.000Z	hischild	inversekinetix	you lost your boot.ini or what?
2008-02-29T17:14:00.000Z	inversekinetix		no hischild nothing like that
2008-02-29T17:15:00.000Z	inversekinetix		i got a BSOD from nowhere and need to retrieve a few files from the C partition before i reinstall
2008-02-29T17:15:00.000Z	hischild	inversekinetix	aaah ... i see
2008-02-29T17:15:00.000Z	hischild	inversekinetix	i was trying to see if i could figure it out somewhere above but that didn't make much sense ... but you can't see your windows drive?
2008-02-29T17:16:00.000Z	inversekinetix	hischild	no i cant see the windows partition, i can see the other partition
2008-02-29T17:17:00.000Z	hischild	inversekinetix	how many partitions do you see total? i see 6 in your fstab (including swap and root both as 1)
2008-02-29T17:17:00.000Z	hischild		idk?
2008-02-29T17:18:00.000Z	inversekinetix		i have 4 drives
2008-02-29T17:19:00.000Z	hischild	inversekinetix	alright ... all 4 show in  your fstab so you should be able to see them. However i have a feeling there is another partition out there that your windows is on ...c orrect?
2008-02-29T17:19:00.000Z	inversekinetix	hischild	4 drives  1= 100gb windows(cant see)/400gb data   1=500gb data  1 = 500gb data   1=80 linux root/swap
2008-02-29T17:19:00.000Z	hischild	inversekinetix	aah i c ... and in nautilus it doesn't show either? (they sometimes show there without reason ... )
2008-02-29T17:21:00.000Z	inversekinetix		it shows the partion as sda1  59.6GB no files
2008-02-29T17:21:00.000Z	inversekinetix		brb, gonna try something
2008-02-29T17:21:00.000Z	hischild	inversekinetix	if it doesn't show as having files there are 2 possibilities ... one is that it screwed over, second is that you have to mount it ... second is much more likely :-)
