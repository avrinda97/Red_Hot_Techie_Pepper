2007-12-04T17:48:00.000Z	mikebeecham		Can I get some help with VirtualBox...I have created a new WindowsXP virtual machine, and given it access to the shared folders on my Secondary Hard Drive (Internal IDE).  When I start the Windows virtual machine, I can access the files on those folders, but I cant write back to them...I am told that either the drive is write-protected or i do not have permissions.  Everything is ok with Linux though?
2007-12-04T17:49:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mikebeecham	as fixarg says, sounds like permissions - and make sure the drive itself is mounted read/write for the host OS
2007-12-04T17:50:00.000Z	mikebeecham	gordonjcp	: the drive is mounted, as I can see and view the files...i can even access them ok...I just cant seem to right back to the drive (folders and files contained within)
2007-12-04T17:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mikebeecham	can you write back to files on the drive from Linux?
2007-12-04T17:51:00.000Z	mikebeecham	gordonjcp	: yes
2007-12-04T17:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mikebeecham	if it's an NTFS filesystem it will probably me mounted read-only
2007-12-04T17:51:00.000Z	mikebeecham	gordonjcp	: it is NTFS
2007-12-04T17:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mikebeecham	... but mounted r/w?
2007-12-04T17:51:00.000Z	mikebeecham	gordonjcp	: yes....I can write back to that drive ok in linux
2007-12-04T17:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mikebeecham	hm, don't know then, maybe there's something in the virtualbox docs
2007-12-04T17:54:00.000Z	mikebeecham	gordonjcp	: maybe...I will look and see
2007-12-04T20:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mikebeecham	What exactly are you trying to do?
2007-12-04T20:45:00.000Z	mikebeecham	gordonjcp	...hey mate...ahhh well, I have been using grabit in windows, and I started using it in wine, but it gets al ittle flaky from time to time...so before I get home i want to make a decision which way I'm going to download and use nzb files.  I thought about what you said this morning, then read up on updating wine (thinking this was the way forward)...so I'm now at a junction of decision making
2007-12-04T20:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mikebeecham	I didn't understand much of that
2007-12-04T20:49:00.000Z	mikebeecham	gordonjcp	: dont worry about it mate :D
2007-12-04T20:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mikebeecham	what are nzb files, and why do they need special consideration when downloading?
2007-12-04T20:58:00.000Z	mikebeecham	gordonjcp	: nzb files are binary files
2007-12-04T21:01:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mikebeecham	so, why do you need special software to download them?
2007-12-04T21:04:00.000Z	mikebeecham	gordonjcp	: because the nzb file is a tracker file, which 'points' to the actual files you are trying to download, such a rar files (you should read up on this reallly)
2007-12-04T21:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mikebeecham	why should I read up on it?
2007-12-04T21:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mikebeecham	it sounds somewhat related to file sharing
