2009-08-25T06:41:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		mb maybe
2009-08-25T06:41:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		mobo recommendations?
2009-08-25T06:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 dozens of web site with MB reviews. Check out ones with that new 'splashtop' feature. :)
2009-09-20T21:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 every partition has a beginning and an end.. thus that defines its size...
2009-09-20T21:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 and all filesystems get mounted SOMEWHERE  / is the root partition.
2009-09-20T21:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 if you dont understand partitioning.. then resize your widnows parittions (from windows is one way) leave part of the hard drive UNALLOCATED. and let the installer auto partition the unallocated space.
2009-09-20T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 then use some smaller size..  we dont know your exact system needs/layout/requirements.
2009-09-20T21:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 use windows.. resize.. leave 40gb or so in a unallocated part of the hard drive..  let installer use that.
2009-09-20T21:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 if theres unallocated space.. i belive the installer asks 'use unalocated' space.
2009-09-20T21:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 otherwise it asks to resize
2009-09-20T21:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 and from what ive seen the windows tools resize ntfs faster then linux tools do.
2009-12-09T07:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 right click on a video file, properties ->  set vlc as the default
2009-12-25T04:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 i dont even use a firewall.. :)
2009-12-30T23:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 i got an actual windows box here.. that i cant get it to show any shares to the lan..  but it does show the UPNP media share. :) so  Im not sure its always linux's fault when theres samba issues.
2010-01-23T03:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 thers proberly some more specific tools to backup/move the users config files also.
2010-02-21T06:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 you are running the nvidia-settings tool as  root?
2010-02-21T06:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 you can save the xorg.conf to  a file thenc opy it.. OR it can apply the settings as a user.
2010-02-21T06:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 thers a lirc wiki page.. but ive not used a remote/lirc in ages.
2010-05-03T21:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JoeSomebody	 it works very well.
