2007-04-23T05:17:00.000Z	mc44	Gartra1	press tab after the first few letters, i.e. pri <tab> and it will autocomplete his nickname
2007-04-23T05:26:00.000Z	mc44	Gartra1	so for example, what do you try to open in gnome which fails?
2007-04-23T05:28:00.000Z	mc44	Gartra1	so, synaptic for example?
2007-04-23T05:28:00.000Z	mc44	Gartra1	ok, try gksudo synaptic from the terminal
2007-04-23T05:29:00.000Z	mc44	Gartra1	it does work fine? you have tried it?
2007-04-23T05:31:00.000Z	mc44	Gartra1	have you run gksudo synaptic from a terminal?
2007-04-23T05:31:00.000Z	Gartra1	mc44	it wont give me admin, just user rights
2007-04-23T05:32:00.000Z	Gartra1	mc44	did you catch that?
2007-04-23T05:33:00.000Z	mc44	Gartra1	yes. are you logged on as the first user you created?
2007-04-23T05:34:00.000Z	Gartra1	mc44	can i pm you?
2007-04-23T05:35:00.000Z	mc44	Gartra1	I'm afraid I dont know how to solve a broken gksudo
2007-04-23T05:41:00.000Z	mc44	Gartra1	a formal complaint?
2007-04-23T05:42:00.000Z	mc44	Gartra1	who is *they*? and there are a number of ops in here
2007-04-23T05:44:00.000Z	mc44	Gartra1	if you want people to help you, insulting them will not work
2007-04-23T05:45:00.000Z	mc44	Gartra1	yes there are, they just do not stay opped
2007-04-23T05:45:00.000Z	mc44	Gartra1	perhaps you should try another avenue of support if you are not getting help here. Try the forums, the mailing lists or the answers feature on launchpad
