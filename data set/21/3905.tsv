2009-02-10T16:00:00.000Z	ChrisW		hey all, I'm looking to make the shell that comes with Ubuntu behave as much like Putty as possible, is there a how-to for this?
2009-02-10T16:00:00.000Z	ChrisW		doesit run on linux?
2009-02-10T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ChrisW	the shell can do anything putty can and more
2009-02-10T16:01:00.000Z	ChrisW	ActionParsnip1	indeed, so I'd prefer to stay with it, but there are some key features that I want to be putty-like ;-)
2009-02-10T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ChrisW	like what, maybe we can advise
2009-02-10T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ChrisW	terminal can do that
2009-02-10T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ChrisW	oic
2009-02-10T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ChrisW	you can copy to the clipboard fine from terminal, the right click thing im not sure of
2009-02-10T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ChrisW	but if you wanna use putty its there
2009-02-10T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ChrisW	just seems a bit pointless imho
2009-02-10T16:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ChrisW	haha
2009-02-10T16:15:00.000Z	ChrisW	ActionParsnip1	the one thing I miss from RHEL was the service command... what benefit is there from typing /etc/init.d/watever?
2009-02-10T16:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ChrisW	thats where services are managed (e.g. sudo /etc/init.d/networking stop) etc
2009-02-10T16:16:00.000Z	ChrisW	ActionParsnip1	yeah, but tab completion for it sucks ;-)
2009-02-10T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ChrisW	should be fine, maybe your tabbing is weird
2009-02-10T16:18:00.000Z	ChrisW	ActionParsnip1	well no, "service" completes fine, but /etc/init stops there because of "init.d/          initramfs-tools/" ;-)
2009-02-10T16:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ChrisW	its /etc/init.d
2009-02-10T16:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ChrisW	stab in a period and hit tab = winner
2009-02-10T16:18:00.000Z	ChrisW	ActionParsnip1	yes, and it doesn't tab complete because of initramfs-tools ;-)
2009-02-10T16:19:00.000Z	ChrisW	ActionParsnip1	indeed, which is what I was complaining about ;-) tab completion for it is slightly annoying compare to tab completion for "service"
2009-02-10T16:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ChrisW	yes but the perid will make it not match initramfs-tools won't it, then it will go to init.d
