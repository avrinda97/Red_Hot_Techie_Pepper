2007-01-09T13:26:00.000Z	ikonia	miranda82	that dmesg error is a warning
2007-01-09T13:27:00.000Z	ikonia	miranda82	ok - could that be down to the file system

2007-01-10T09:14:00.000Z	miranda82	ikonia	yes, i also tried ext2
2007-01-10T09:14:00.000Z	ikonia	miranda82	is it possible your usb bus isn't properly supported ?
2007-01-10T09:14:00.000Z	miranda82	ikonia	problem is that when i'm formatting the drive is also ejected
2007-01-10T09:15:00.000Z	ikonia	miranda82	loose wire, dodgy power supply ?

2007-01-10T09:15:00.000Z	ikonia	miranda82	then its the drive
2007-01-10T09:15:00.000Z	miranda82	ikonia	actually the usb hub is powered
2007-01-10T09:15:00.000Z	miranda82	ikonia	that's the strange things, it's brand new
2007-01-10T09:15:00.000Z	ikonia	miranda82	doesn't mean its not got a fault
2007-01-10T09:16:00.000Z	miranda82	ikonia	yeah.. probably.. bad luck
2007-01-10T09:17:00.000Z	ikonia	miranda82	if its a hardware problem.....no
2007-01-10T09:17:00.000Z	ikonia	miranda82	how do you expect the channel to fix a hardware error ?
2007-01-10T09:18:00.000Z	ikonia	miranda82	not if its a hardware error - which this looks like it is
