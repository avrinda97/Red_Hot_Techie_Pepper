2005-08-08T14:18:00.000Z	f_newton	kemik	he is having to go back n forth between his windows partition to connect and his ubuntu to make changes
2005-08-08T14:19:00.000Z	f_newton	kemik	wow partition magic must have come a long way
2005-08-08T14:21:00.000Z	kemik	f_newton	 it has
2005-08-08T14:21:00.000Z	kemik	f_newton	 and i googled it, PM can convert NTFS->FAT32
2005-08-08T14:22:00.000Z	kemik	f_newton	 PM is quite cool.. even tho im a bit superstitous about resizing and converting partitions ;)
2005-08-08T14:23:00.000Z	kemik	f_newton	 unfortunately im stuck with a ntfs partition, dualbooting.. even tho i spend 95% of my time in linux
2005-08-08T14:23:00.000Z	kemik	f_newton	 there just isnt a GOOD ftp program for linux... i've been messing with GTK now to write my own, but Glade isnt playing along with me
2005-08-08T14:24:00.000Z	kemik	f_newton	 preferably a gui-based ssl & fxp client, not "ftp" :P
2005-08-08T14:26:00.000Z	kemik	f_newton	 you cant SSh into a ftp and find that convenient
2005-08-08T14:26:00.000Z	kemik	f_newton	 what i want essentially for linux is sort of like "flashfxp" :)
2005-08-08T14:26:00.000Z	kemik	f_newton	 there's pftp by hoe, but it doesnt support recursive get
2005-08-08T14:28:00.000Z	kemik	f_newton	 if filezilla supports SSL i'm happy for now =)
2005-08-08T14:29:00.000Z	kemik	f_newton	 already there ;)
2005-08-08T14:29:00.000Z	kemik	f_newton	 ssl = secure socket layer, not the same thing as being behind a firewall ;)
2005-08-08T14:50:00.000Z	kemik	f_newton	 filezilla is for windows only! using cxoffice to get it working ?
2005-08-08T14:58:00.000Z	f_newton	kemik	 http://gftp.seul.org/
2005-08-08T14:58:00.000Z	kemik	f_newton	 aah, tried that one, no ssl-support :(
2005-08-08T15:00:00.000Z	f_newton	kemik	and here too...  http://linuxreviews.org/software/ftp-clients/
2005-08-08T15:02:00.000Z	kemik	f_newton	 thx :)
2005-08-08T15:04:00.000Z	f_newton	kemik	are you running gnome or kde?
