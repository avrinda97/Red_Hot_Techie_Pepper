2007-04-23T06:37:00.000Z	igs		hi. in the terminal I can access as normal user an usb device with pmount /dev/sdb1, but If I click in the nautilus on the unmounted usb device, i get an access denied error. Im using feisty fawn... Why I have this problem? It worked with the same configurations on edgy and it worked properly!
2007-04-23T06:39:00.000Z	igs		I want the usb device to be mounted from  nautilus
2007-04-23T06:39:00.000Z	igs		as normal user
2007-04-23T06:40:00.000Z	igs		yes
2007-04-23T06:40:00.000Z	kritzstapf	igs	isnt it mounted when you plug it in? udev rules should mount it ..
2007-04-23T06:41:00.000Z	igs	kritzstapf	Im a network administrator at a school. we're  using ldap and pam for authentication
2007-04-23T06:41:00.000Z	kritzstapf		how to change the label of vfat partitions?
2007-04-23T06:41:00.000Z	igs		you can mount as normal user with pmount
2007-04-23T06:41:00.000Z	kritzstapf	igs	yep
2007-04-23T06:41:00.000Z	igs		but only from the terminal not from nautilus
2007-04-23T06:42:00.000Z	kritzstapf	igs	nautilus can mount things? didnt know that :D
2007-04-23T06:43:00.000Z	igs	kritzstapf	yes I know that, but I get an access denied error
2007-04-23T06:43:00.000Z	kritzstapf	igs	you know that i didnt know that nautilus is able to do mounting?
2007-04-23T06:44:00.000Z	kritzstapf		kind of magic
2007-04-23T06:44:00.000Z	igs	kritzstapf	 I know that nautilus can mount things, and normally this works fine, but not anymore!
2007-04-23T06:45:00.000Z	kritzstapf	igs	where is the function to mount things? _i_ dont know it
2007-04-23T06:47:00.000Z	igs	kritzstapf	normally devices appear in nautilus when plugged in.. That also happens with my usb-Stick. Now normally you just double-click it and It becomes mounted!
2007-04-23T06:47:00.000Z	kritzstapf	igs	i think its mounted before you can doubleclick it
2007-04-23T06:48:00.000Z	kritzstapf	igs	the mounting is not done by nautilus, its done by the hald and defined in the udev rules as far as i know
2007-04-23T06:48:00.000Z	igs	kritzstapf	no it isnt, I can mount it then from the terminal with pmount and then access it from nautilus, but I must have it mounted just like this.
2007-04-23T06:49:00.000Z	kritzstapf	igs	so the udev rules are messed up
