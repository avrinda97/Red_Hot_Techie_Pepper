2010-10-11T03:02:00.000Z	Maeth		why hath linux forsaken me?  I upgraded to 10.10 and now grub REALLY hates me.  I get into a grub rescue shell that i fear because i never seem to be able to do anything in it.
2010-10-11T03:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Maeth	not Linux's fault, and Ubuntu isn't the only Linux distribution/distro :)  anyway yeah Grub 2 can be a pain.  uhmm this might be helpful
2010-10-11T03:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Maeth	yes its a fault of  Grub 2 or Ubuntu, but not the Linux kernel :)
2010-10-11T03:05:00.000Z	Maeth	sebsebseb	oh yes, i think i learned something about that, it's gnu i hate not linux, right?
2010-10-11T03:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Maeth	I hate?
2010-10-11T03:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Maeth	oh
2010-10-11T03:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Maeth	no Grub 2 isn't really part of the GNU project so its not GNU
2010-10-11T03:06:00.000Z	Maeth	sebsebseb	i mean whoever made grub, although it's probably just tough to make something that works on everything
2010-10-11T03:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Maeth	and Grub 2 is mainly used in Ubuntu, Debian, and distros based on Ubuntu or Debian, in  fact a lot of other distros including Fedora even, which is  a bit more cutting edge than Ubuntu, still use the old version, because the developers belive it is more stable and relible
2010-10-11T03:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Maeth	personally I much prefer the old version, and get no advantage from Grub 2
2010-10-11T03:08:00.000Z	Maeth	sebsebseb	so you can avoid grub 2 altogether?
2010-10-11T03:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Maeth	so if you want to blame someone,  blame the developers of Grub 2, or even Ubuntu/Debian developers for doing it
2010-10-11T03:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Maeth	I think the old version will be in the 10.10 repo, but if so, you probably can't just install and use it
2010-10-11T03:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Maeth	you could install 9.04, and then upgrade, to 10.10, whilst still keeping Grub 1
2010-10-11T03:10:00.000Z	Maeth	sebsebseb	sounds great, if i can't get this to work i'll do that on both machines
2010-10-11T03:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Maeth	and there are plenty of great alternative distros out there as well, that still use Grub 1 :)
2010-10-11T03:17:00.000Z	Maeth	sebsebseb	shouldn't it be advertised more? since that's what pc users love to gloat about?
2010-10-11T03:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Maeth	shoudn't what be advertised more?
2010-10-11T03:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Maeth	there is at least one Ubuntu gaming site that comes to mind, but I haven't been to it yet, or did I before once or something, no don't think so
2010-10-11T03:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Maeth	anyway started by  those that do omgubuntu.co.uk
2010-10-11T03:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Maeth	not sure the address right now, but was mentioend on there before
