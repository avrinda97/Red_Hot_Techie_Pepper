2011-10-20T02:42:00.000Z	YawningAngel		dd
2011-10-20T02:42:00.000Z	YawningAngel		I've always appreciated dd's silent obedience
2011-10-20T02:42:00.000Z	YawningAngel		Except when it silently and obediently converted one of my hard drives to a music cd
2011-10-20T02:43:00.000Z	YawningAngel		that kinda sucked
2011-10-20T02:44:00.000Z	YawningAngel		You sir are a scholar and a gentleman
2011-10-20T02:44:00.000Z	cajunmlle	YawningAngel	what syntax do you use for doing that?
2011-10-20T02:44:00.000Z	YawningAngel		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)
2011-10-20T02:45:00.000Z	YawningAngel		dd if=/dev/blah of=/dev/blah2
2011-10-20T02:45:00.000Z	YawningAngel		Just be careful because it will MERCILESSLY overwrite the target
2011-10-20T02:46:00.000Z	cajunmlle	YawningAngel	you must have a very unusual optical drive for that to actually burn discs
2011-10-20T02:47:00.000Z	YawningAngel	cajunmlle	are you trying to tell me you DON'T refer to all your sata drives as blah?
2011-10-20T02:47:00.000Z	YawningAngel		It's wonderfully simple
2011-10-20T02:48:00.000Z	YawningAngel		Just please pay attention to what you are doing with it
2011-10-20T02:48:00.000Z	YawningAngel		Depends on the application
2011-10-20T02:49:00.000Z	YawningAngel		Just straight dd has always worked fine for install discs
2011-10-20T02:49:00.000Z	YawningAngel		Which is all I do it for these days
2011-10-20T02:50:00.000Z	cajunmlle		considering that at the time of burning a disc, if needs to include a lead-in and lead-out and toc, all extra info beyond the iso being xfer'd, I'd have to say that a simple "dd" command would get you something completely unusable
2011-10-20T02:50:00.000Z	YawningAngel	cajunmlle	I would agree completely
2011-10-20T02:50:00.000Z	YawningAngel		But if all you want is to  put the iso on a disc, dd is quick and easy
2011-10-20T02:50:00.000Z	YawningAngel		choose it as an option in LDM
2011-10-20T02:52:00.000Z	cajunmlle	YawningAngel	lacking lead0in lead-out and toc, any drive you insert the burned disc into will reject it in firmware before the host machine ever gets to see the disc
