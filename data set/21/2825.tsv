2010-02-07T15:06:00.000Z	reto`	Speedy2	oh... sry... you're not talking about modules...
2010-02-07T15:06:00.000Z	Speedy2	reto`	I'm not talking about a module, I mean a "daemon"
2010-02-07T15:07:00.000Z	Speedy2	reto`	Any ideas for services?
2010-02-07T15:09:00.000Z	reto`	Speedy2	system/administration/services?
2010-02-07T15:10:00.000Z	Speedy2	reto`	I tried, but it doesn't show services that are running as running (i.e. avahi-daemon)
2010-02-07T15:12:00.000Z	reto`	Speedy2	try rcconf
2010-02-07T15:12:00.000Z	Speedy2	reto`	Yeah, I tried that guy too
2010-02-07T15:12:00.000Z	reto`	Speedy2	and?
2010-02-07T15:13:00.000Z	Speedy2	reto`	It shows the services I don't want as disabled (I used it to disable them) but they still start
2010-02-07T15:13:00.000Z	Speedy2	reto`	avahi-daemon is a good example.
2010-02-07T15:18:00.000Z	reto`	Speedy2	http://en.kioskea.net/faq/739-disabling-the-avahi-daemon
2010-02-07T15:18:00.000Z	Speedy2	reto`	I found that too and tried it.  No go :(
2010-02-07T15:20:00.000Z	reto`	Speedy2	well, then stick around until a pro gets in, eh?
2010-02-07T15:20:00.000Z	Speedy2	reto`	Do you have avahi-daemon running in the background as well?
2010-02-07T15:22:00.000Z	reto`	Speedy2	no... actually I'm on archlinux... just wanted to see how the ubuntu channels gets along... have been using ubuntu before :)
2010-02-07T15:22:00.000Z	Speedy2	reto`	Ah Arch.  Just goto rc.d and disbale the daemons you don't want =).
2010-02-07T15:23:00.000Z	reto`	Speedy2	well... mostly daemons are not even started until you put them in :)
2010-02-07T15:24:00.000Z	Speedy2	reto`	Yes, I know.  I evaluated Arch before going to Kubuntu.  I like most of Arch but when it was such a PITA to get Xorg working, I gave up
2010-02-07T15:24:00.000Z	Speedy2	reto`	Mind you, I got it working, but it was kind of annoying.
2010-02-07T15:25:00.000Z	reto`	Speedy2	there's also chakra I heard... arch with KDE
2010-02-07T15:25:00.000Z	Speedy2	reto`	Too many bugs right now, but maybe better going forward
