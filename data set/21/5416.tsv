2008-03-07T02:40:00.000Z	gafatoa		hello guys ! does anyone know how is determined the default graphic mode (i mean the one seted up uner X after boot) ?
2008-03-07T02:41:00.000Z	komputes	gafatoa	nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-03-07T02:43:00.000Z	gafatoa	komputes	I've looked in it and search around the web: if the xorg defines different modes which one is "chosen" on startup ?
2008-03-07T02:44:00.000Z	komputes	gafatoa	ah I see what your saying, let me look into it - Default Resolution
2008-03-07T02:47:00.000Z	komputes	gafatoa	in your xorg.conf file do you have a line which look like:
2008-03-07T02:47:00.000Z	gafatoa	komputes	got this one: Option         "metamodes" "DFP: 1680x1050 +0+0, TV: 1024x768 +0+0;DFP: 1024x768 +0+0, TV: 1024x768 +0+0"
2008-03-07T02:48:00.000Z	komputes	gafatoa	ooo, tricky, i would make a backup copy and remove the modes you don't want as default, or try to rearrange them
2008-03-07T02:48:00.000Z	gafatoa	komputes	nvidia-settings wrote those lines ...
2008-03-07T02:49:00.000Z	komputes	gafatoa	yes, thats fine, i just don't want you to mess things up
2008-03-07T02:49:00.000Z	komputes	gafatoa	how experienced are you in linux?
2008-03-07T02:49:00.000Z	gafatoa	komputes	by default my screen is at 1024x768. I can make a "xrandr" to switch upper without problem
2008-03-07T02:50:00.000Z	gafatoa	komputes	I'm not a newbie
2008-03-07T02:50:00.000Z	komputes	gafatoa	have you tried: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2008-03-07T02:50:00.000Z	gafatoa	komputes	no
2008-03-07T02:51:00.000Z	komputes	gafatoa	write that line down, and do alt+ctrl+F1 and try that line
2008-03-07T02:51:00.000Z	komputes	gafatoa	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2008-03-07T02:52:00.000Z	komputes	gafatoa	when you do ctrl+alt+f1 to come back to GUI do ctrl+alt+f7
2008-03-07T02:52:00.000Z	gafatoa	komputes	I try this, thanks
2008-03-07T02:52:00.000Z	komputes	gafatoa	good luck, when it asks you possible resolutions, just chose the one you want only
2008-03-07T02:55:00.000Z	gafatoa	komputes	done it, I restart
2008-03-07T02:59:00.000Z	gafatoa	komputes	same problem, X starts in 1024 ... here is the xorg.conf "modes" line: Modes  "1680x1050" "1024x768" "800x600"
