2005-10-15T07:37:00.000Z	vbgunz		I have a question... If I wanted to stay on the completely supported side of Ubuntu I should *not* enable these links in /etc/apt/sources correct? : breezy main universe multiverse restricted, breezy-security main restricted, breezy-security universe
2005-10-15T07:38:00.000Z	vbgunz		I mean, if I just enable the first two, I'll be ok and won't be missing much correct? I am new to Linux and would like to keep Ubuntu as stable as possible without worrying about extra goodies
2005-10-15T07:38:00.000Z	thenuke	vbgunz	obviously, if you dont need them, why have them?
2005-10-15T07:39:00.000Z	thenuke	vbgunz	but like you are told, they can be considered safe.
2005-10-15T07:39:00.000Z	vbgunz	thenuke	I don't know if I need them and was just curious maybe the official Ubuntu team releases enough so not to worry about any goodies outside of anything Ubuntu official...
2005-10-15T07:39:00.000Z	thenuke	vbgunz	welll, you know when you need them :D
2005-10-15T07:39:00.000Z	thenuke	vbgunz	try to install something, wont work, then you can enable extra-repos to propably find it
2005-10-15T07:40:00.000Z	thenuke	vbgunz	but if you are using synaptic to search thru the stuff you might want to have, then you should enable those extra repos, and should not worry about them
2005-10-15T07:40:00.000Z	vbgunz	thenuke	yeah, I think I rather take that route for now... I just want Ubuntu the way the dev teams feels it'll be most stable... No conflicts by a long shot if possible, if Ubuntu could help it
2005-10-15T07:42:00.000Z	vbgunz	thenuke	that brings me to my next question, I've been really tempted to go with the w32codecs, libdvdcss, etc... I heard the best way to get them is to temporarily open up those links and add some and download the codecs, etc, then comment those links out so no accidental updates would occur... This sounds fine *but* how in the world do they get updated? Manually?
2005-10-15T07:44:00.000Z	thenuke	vbgunz	yes, enable repos what have those, and then apt-get install stuff, then apt-get update gets them updated if you have those repos still enabled
2005-10-15T07:45:00.000Z	thenuke	vbgunz	And am I wrong? but I think that w32codecs and libdvd can be found from ubuntus extra-repos?
2005-10-15T07:45:00.000Z	vbgunz	thenuke	so I can download them. Comment them out. and still stay updated?
2005-10-15T07:45:00.000Z	thenuke	vbgunz	they wont get updated if you comment the repos out where they came from
2005-10-15T07:45:00.000Z	vbgunz	thenuke	you're correct *but* as I said i was tempted because I lived so long with it on Windows... For example, all movie trailers come in w32codecs basically :P
2005-10-15T07:46:00.000Z	thenuke	vbgunz	as I think that they are not so critical things in your system, you could just enable those repos like once in a month or so on, and then do the update and then disable those repos again
2005-10-15T07:46:00.000Z	thenuke	vbgunz	but I really dont understand why you would need to disable those repos =) and not to have them enabled all the time
2005-10-15T07:47:00.000Z	thenuke	vbgunz	as you will have to install stuff from those repos by your self :D they are not a problem in your repository-list
2005-10-15T07:47:00.000Z	vbgunz	thenuke	It's just lately Ubuntu feels slow *but* it shouldn't be... Windows is amazingly fast on a first install... At one point Ubuntu felt fast *but* lately it feels a big sluggish and I never enabled a backport... I am thinking some things I've downloaded by enabling those extra links probably messed something up :(
2005-10-15T07:48:00.000Z	thenuke	vbgunz	what kind of things you have downloaded then
2005-10-15T07:58:00.000Z	vbgunz	thenuke	I installed seahorse, KDE, bsdgames and thunderbird that I can recall off the top of my head... All through Synaptic too... Outside of that, I am not sure why Ubuntu feels sluggish... Could this be why some users choose to compile there own kernels?
