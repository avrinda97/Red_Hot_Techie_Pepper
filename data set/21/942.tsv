2011-04-03T00:33:00.000Z	DasEi	Packrat_Mobile	just came in, yes I know some
2011-04-03T00:39:00.000Z	DasEi	Packrat_Mobile	ask detailed question
2011-04-03T00:43:00.000Z	DasEi	Packrat_Mobile	I don't know your asus personally, mine does fine in compatible mode, with real 'freky'setup, mixed ide n sata
2011-04-03T00:44:00.000Z	DasEi	Packrat_Mobile	but apart from investing much money for a davicontrol or such, I'd recommend using softraid rather then this fake-raid of the mobo
2011-04-03T00:45:00.000Z	DasEi	Packrat_Mobile	freaky*
2011-04-03T00:45:00.000Z	Packrat_Mobile	DasEi	will check into that.
2011-04-03T00:45:00.000Z	Packrat_Mobile	DasEi	(thats what i thought, just checking)

2011-04-03T00:52:00.000Z	Packrat_Mobile	DasEi	Question, do i leave the BIOS settings on the HD's as RAID when using the software raid or set it to something else?
2011-04-03T00:53:00.000Z	DasEi	Packrat_Mobile	for mdadm bios regular, no raid function
