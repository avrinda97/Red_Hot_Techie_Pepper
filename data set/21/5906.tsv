2007-07-15T16:28:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude		i have one computer for each linux distribution available, so i get the best of all worlds!
2007-07-15T05:36:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude		Anyone here use X-Chat for Ubuntu? Trying to make it automatically connect to #ubuntu, #ubunto-offtopic, and #winehq when I open the program, but it only wants to connect to #ubuntu.
2007-07-15T05:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Newbie_Dude	its under server options.
2007-07-15T05:37:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	IndyGunFreak	thanks I'll check... variant - not Gnome
2007-07-15T05:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Newbie_Dude	well, you're using Xchat right?.
2007-07-15T05:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Newbie_Dude	sorry, after highlighting on Freenode, you need to click edit.
2007-07-15T05:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Newbie_Dude	did it work?
2007-07-15T05:41:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	IndyGunFreak	not yet gonna try again, but i think i got it
2007-07-15T05:43:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	IndyGunFreak	OK it didn't work. I did #ubuntu,#ubuntu-offtopic in the Channel section, maybe I should try #ubuntu,ubuntu-offtopic wiithout a 2nd #
2007-07-15T05:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Newbie_Dude	no, you had it right the first time
2007-07-15T05:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Newbie_Dude	are you sure there's no space after the comma?... there should be no space there.
2007-07-15T05:45:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	IndyGunFreak	it worked, thanks :)
2007-07-15T05:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Newbie_Dude	no prb.
2007-07-15T05:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Newbie_Dude	you have a space after the comma?
2007-07-15T05:45:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	IndyGunFreak	i think i did something wrong cause now 2 #ubuntus are open :P no biggie i'll mess with the config, hope i'm not spammy loggin on and off
2007-07-15T05:45:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	IndyGunFreak	no space after the comma, it actually deleted the spacea fter i put it there
2007-07-15T05:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Newbie_Dude	you're listed as in ubuntu twice?
2007-07-15T05:46:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	IndyGunFreak	yah, it did Ubuntu Servers > #ubuntu, and Freenode > #ubuntu, #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-07-15T05:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Newbie_Dude	thats why, go back to your network list, highlight freenode, edit, and choose, "Connec tot this server only"
2007-07-15T05:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Newbie_Dude	or highlight the ubuntu channel, and choose not to connnect to it
2007-07-15T05:48:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	IndyGunFreak	worked perfectly. Logged into #ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic. Thanks for the step-by-step
