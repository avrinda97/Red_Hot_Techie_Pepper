2011-11-02T14:09:00.000Z	cablop		in my board the SATA are working like NAtive IDEs, but they have the option of AHCI?
2011-11-02T14:10:00.000Z	cablop		... does anybody knows about an improvement or issue to enable the AHCI mode for SATA disks?
2011-11-02T14:12:00.000Z	cablop		ok, then bad news
2011-11-02T14:13:00.000Z	cablop		wow

2011-11-02T14:16:00.000Z	cablop		i mean the combination
2011-11-02T14:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	cablop	 uaed awn with unuty also
2011-11-02T14:17:00.000Z	cablop	dr_willis	but unity is TERRIBLE poor AWN xD
2011-11-02T14:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	cablop	 huh?
2011-12-02T18:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	cablop	 unity? gnome shell? or what exactly. :)
2011-12-02T18:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	cablop	 i wouldent think so.
2011-12-02T18:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	cablop	 using swap at all.. is the biggest hit
2011-12-02T18:47:00.000Z	cablop	dr_willis	yes, but i have fw ram now, so willing to cope with that for a time until i get more
2011-12-02T18:52:00.000Z	cablop	dr_willis	i was on gnome-shell when moving my lvm logical volume to a new physical volume... and... now linux won't boot and i ended with a weird LV called vg-pvmove0... and i don't know what to do now
2011-12-27T19:50:00.000Z	cablop	dr_willis	?
2012-10-01T01:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	cablop	 you mean an S3 video card?
2012-10-01T01:39:00.000Z	cablop	dr_willis	a s3? hmmm, i don't remember exactly, it uses openchrome
2012-10-01T01:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	cablop	 Via S3 i think is their brand/chipset.. From what i normally see/hear about them.. you are lucky you even get a screen.
2012-10-01T01:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	cablop	 sounds to me like it may be using the vga drivers
