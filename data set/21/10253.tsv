2008-01-04T04:42:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	free -m
2008-01-04T04:45:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2008-01-04T04:50:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	the vnc server built into gnome (vino) is set up to allow you to control the logged in desktop, which remains logged in after you disconnect
2008-01-04T04:50:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	of course the best way is shell only with screen and ssh ;)
2008-01-04T04:50:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	it's faster over a slow connection, yes
2008-01-04T04:51:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	maybe you should try the built in first though
2008-01-04T04:51:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	with ssh, you use screen to do that
2008-01-04T04:51:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	it allows you to create, detach, then reattach later to a shell session(s)
2008-01-04T04:52:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	yes screen is a command
2008-01-04T04:53:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	for downloading you can use wget
2008-01-04T04:53:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	indeed
2008-01-04T04:54:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	wget probably grabs from ftp in addition to http
2008-01-04T04:54:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	server?
2008-01-04T04:54:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	for just yourself or others?
2008-01-04T04:56:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	well one easy way is to just give them accounts on your machine and just use ssh/sftp, assuming you trust them somewhat, though without sudo access they can't really do anything anyway
2008-01-04T04:59:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	yes, with this approach they would have accounts with their own /home directories
2008-01-04T04:59:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	you could use group permissions to control shared resources
2008-01-04T05:01:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	much better to use a client on your router
2008-01-04T05:02:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	since your router knows when the IP changes it can update immediately
2008-01-04T05:02:00.000Z	astro76	sverige	maybe, what do you have?
