2005-03-19T08:12:00.000Z	carl		how do I redirect md5sum -vc md5sum.txt output to a file?
2005-03-19T08:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	carl	command > output.txt
2005-03-19T08:12:00.000Z	carl	eyequeue	no good
2005-03-19T08:13:00.000Z	carl	eyequeue	 that works on my FC2 box, but apparently ubuntu installs a md5sum that doesn't send the output to stdout
2005-03-19T08:13:00.000Z	eyequeue	carl	 how not?  is the output you're trying for perhpas on STDERR rather than STDOUT?
2005-03-19T08:13:00.000Z	eyequeue	carl	 eww, hang on a sec
2005-03-19T08:14:00.000Z	eyequeue	carl	 i'm at a loss, sorry.  you're sure the file contains what -c expects it to?
2005-03-19T08:15:00.000Z	carl	eyequeue	 yup - it is the one on the hoary install cd
2005-03-19T08:15:00.000Z	eyequeue	carl	 okay, that was the only thing that came to mind here, sorry
2005-03-19T08:15:00.000Z	carl		woa... the -v did it
2005-03-19T08:16:00.000Z	carl		hmm, maybe not
2005-03-19T08:16:00.000Z	carl		how do I redirect stderr to stdout, or a file?
2005-03-19T08:17:00.000Z	eyequeue	carl	 md5sum -vc md5sum.txt 2>&1 output.txt  perhaps?
2005-03-19T08:18:00.000Z	carl	eyequeue	there we go.  now tee gets something to chew on
2005-03-19T08:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	carl	 that's buried under "REDIRECTION" in the very huge "man bash" btw, if you ever need to find it again
2005-03-19T08:21:00.000Z	carl	eyequeue	thanks - I have been told about 2>&1 but couldn't remember where the & went
2005-03-19T08:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	carl	 np
2005-03-19T08:21:00.000Z	carl	eyequeue	does the description of ls > dirlist 2>&1 look right?
2005-03-19T08:22:00.000Z	eyequeue	carl	 yeah, they're showing a bit of hocus pocus with redircting things in different orders.  the gotcha to keep in mind with bash commandlines is they are parsed from right to left
2005-03-19T08:22:00.000Z	carl		ah, the R to L is what messed me up
2005-03-19T08:23:00.000Z	eyequeue	carl	 yeah, it's counterintuitive to english speakers
