2007-06-19T15:04:00.000Z	bharat862004	crdlb	which card and model no u have ??
2007-06-19T15:05:00.000Z	crdlb	bharat862004	I have an old ati radeon 7500 (which uses different drivers from new ati cards)
2007-06-19T15:05:00.000Z	bharat862004	crdlb	how is that running ?
2007-06-19T15:05:00.000Z	crdlb	bharat862004	great
2007-06-19T15:06:00.000Z	bharat862004	crdlb	different ati cards have different drivers ????
2007-06-19T15:07:00.000Z	bharat862004	crdlb	what u mean by using open source driver ??? and not ati drivers ??
2007-06-19T15:09:00.000Z	bharat862004	crdlb	that is why i was going for ati graphics card ;)... already searched lot on net
2007-06-19T15:09:00.000Z	crdlb	bharat862004	the proprietary ati drivers are so terrible that if you tested equal nvidia and ati cards on linux, the ati card would be 50% slower
2007-06-19T15:28:00.000Z	bharat862004	crdlb	from where did u get ur open source driver for ati cards ??
2007-06-19T15:28:00.000Z	crdlb	bharat862004	it comes with ubuntu, but it only support old cards
2007-06-19T15:29:00.000Z	bharat862004	crdlb	ok sir ;)
2007-06-19T15:29:00.000Z	crdlb	bharat862004	it has absolutely no support for the X1600 for example
2007-06-19T15:29:00.000Z	bharat862004	crdlb	hmm
