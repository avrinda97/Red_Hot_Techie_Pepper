2010-01-18T09:54:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	razertek	try editing mine... backup yours first though
2010-01-18T09:54:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	razertek	if it works for you yea
2010-01-18T09:55:00.000Z	razertek	NotTooSmart	*
2010-01-18T09:56:00.000Z	razertek	NotTooSmart	was wondering how it could help making my pc appearant on the network
2010-01-18T09:57:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	razertek	because that config works to my knowledge, so if you edited it to your needs it might work for you...
2010-01-18T09:59:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	razertek	sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
2010-01-18T09:59:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	razertek	no need to restart
2010-01-18T10:00:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	razertek	um, yea its going to work on reboot too..
2010-01-18T10:02:00.000Z	razertek	NotTooSmart	k i was just wondering how sometimes when i edit the smb.conf and do a samba restart it gets thhings working but when i reboot the next time they are not
2010-01-18T10:02:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	razertek	weird, its the same config file, so as long as samba loads on boot it should be consistent
2010-01-18T10:03:00.000Z	razertek	NotTooSmart	what does /crypt represent as a whole
2010-01-18T10:04:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	razertek	on my system or to you? its the shared directory
2010-01-18T10:05:00.000Z	razertek	NotTooSmart	yes...but is it like a config folder for having things work in the smb.conf as a whole or just some share you have and i dont?
2010-01-18T10:10:00.000Z	razertek	NotTooSmart	i can see myself now but i cannot mount myself
2010-01-18T10:10:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	razertek	mount your self?
2010-01-18T10:11:00.000Z	razertek	NotTooSmart	when i double click on my name in network
2010-01-18T10:11:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	razertek	why do you need to view your own files over the network on your local machine?
2010-01-18T10:13:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	razertek	i am not sure, my ubuntu server does not use a GUI, so I usually just test from windows
2010-01-18T10:14:00.000Z	razertek	NotTooSmart	thankyou for helping me though
