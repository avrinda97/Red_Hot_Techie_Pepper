2009-12-25T13:36:00.000Z	DexterLB		so, anyone to answer my grub question?
2009-12-25T13:36:00.000Z	fahadsadah	DexterLB	Please could you repeat it?
2009-12-25T13:36:00.000Z	DexterLB		sometimes grub2 doesn't want to automatically start the kernel after an s2disk, power failiure, and sometimes with no apparent reason. Can it be configured to always boot the first kernel without displaying the menu, or at least to have a timeout?
2009-12-25T13:37:00.000Z	fahadsadah	DexterLB	Yes, you can.
2009-12-25T13:37:00.000Z	fahadsadah		Just a second, please?
2009-12-25T13:38:00.000Z	DexterLB	fahadsadah	how?
2009-12-25T13:38:00.000Z	fahadsadah	DexterLB	Please can you !pastebin your current GRUB config?
2009-12-25T13:38:00.000Z	fahadsadah		!pastebin
2009-12-25T13:40:00.000Z	DexterLB	fahadsadah	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/346349/
2009-12-25T13:41:00.000Z	fahadsadah	DexterLB	That's it?
2009-12-25T13:42:00.000Z	DexterLB	fahadsadah	that's the entire contents of /etc/default/grub
2009-12-25T13:42:00.000Z	fahadsadah		Sorry.
2009-12-25T13:42:00.000Z	fahadsadah		I wanted /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2009-12-25T13:43:00.000Z	DexterLB	fahadsadah	but I thought /etc/default/grub was vital because it is used to generate /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2009-12-25T13:43:00.000Z	DexterLB	fahadsadah	I'll post it anyway
2009-12-25T13:43:00.000Z	fahadsadah	DexterLB	I need /boot/grub/grub.cfg because it contains details of your hard drives.
2009-12-25T13:44:00.000Z	fahadsadah		With that, I can write you a new grub.cfg that has no menu
2009-12-25T13:45:00.000Z	DexterLB	fahadsadah	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/346351/
2009-12-25T13:47:00.000Z	fahadsadah	DexterLB	Sorry, no, I don't know.
2009-12-25T13:47:00.000Z	fahadsadah		I thought grub2 would be like grub.
2009-12-25T13:47:00.000Z	DexterLB	fahadsadah	it's totally different :(
