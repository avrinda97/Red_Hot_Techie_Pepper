2005-07-24T07:42:00.000Z	kbrooks	axis^zzz	ubuntu is open source
2005-07-24T07:42:00.000Z	kbrooks	axis^zzz	you can, it will still be open source
2005-07-24T07:42:00.000Z	axis^zzz	kbrooks	 I want to sell computers for a price, then say to people. "it's 250$ more if you want windows, or i give you Ubuntu for free"
2005-07-24T07:42:00.000Z	kbrooks	axis^zzz	non-free does not taint ubuntu
2005-07-24T07:43:00.000Z	kbrooks	axis^zzz	none at all
2005-07-24T07:43:00.000Z	kbrooks	axis^zzz	i use 'open source', not 'free software' because the latter is confusing
2005-07-24T07:45:00.000Z	kbrooks	axis^zzz	incorrect.
2005-07-24T07:46:00.000Z	kbrooks	axis^zzz	you can sell ubuntu for whatever price you want as long as you leave the sources.list intact. you can change it, but you should not disable  access to source
2005-07-24T07:46:00.000Z	kbrooks	axis^zzz	deb-src uncommented is ok. # deb-src is NOT ok
2005-07-24T07:46:00.000Z	axis^zzz	kbrooks	 that's hilarious.. but i understand
2005-07-24T07:47:00.000Z	kbrooks	axis^zzz	programs are programs

2005-07-24T07:49:00.000Z	kbrooks	axis^zzz	using terms interchangably can confuse people
