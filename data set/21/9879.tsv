2005-07-02T11:20:00.000Z	sjmurdoch		This page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCompileHowto says: "At this point, you need to change your kernel's configuration to statically include your bus, disk, and filesystem drivers." - do you know why this is the case? I never did this in Debian Woody and didn't have problems.
2005-07-02T11:21:00.000Z	bob2	sjmurdoch	if you didn't do it on woody, you wouldn't have had a bootable kernel
2005-07-02T11:21:00.000Z	bob2	sjmurdoch	the default woody config included such things statically
2005-07-02T11:22:00.000Z	sjmurdoch	bob2	But not on Hoary? Above that warning it says to copy the .config from /boot to the compile directory and that was sufficient for Woody
2005-07-02T11:24:00.000Z	bob2	sjmurdoch	why are you compiling a kernel anyway?
2005-07-02T11:24:00.000Z	sjmurdoch	bob2	I am trying to debug a device driver, so want to make some changes to it
2005-07-02T11:25:00.000Z	sjmurdoch	bob2	Ubuntu would appear to be different. The .boot/config... in Hoary has IDE as a module, whereas in Woody it is static
2005-07-02T11:26:00.000Z	bob2	sjmurdoch	yes, woody was from 2002
2005-07-02T11:26:00.000Z	bob2	sjmurdoch	sarge is the same as hoary
2005-07-02T11:26:00.000Z	bob2	sjmurdoch	if you know how to debug a driver, presumably you know how to configure a kernel, so just go from scratch
2005-07-02T11:27:00.000Z	sjmurdoch	bob2	I could, but I haven't compiled one with Ubuntu and just installed it yesterday so am looking for the easiest option
2005-07-02T11:28:00.000Z	bob2	sjmurdoch	it's identical to every other os
2005-07-02T11:29:00.000Z	bob2	sjmurdoch	this is not between "woody and hoary" it's between "2002 and the modern world".  everyone is doing initrd now
2005-07-02T11:30:00.000Z	sjmurdoch	bob2	So if I use an initrd, I don't need to compile in bus/disk/filesystem? That howto implies that it does, which confused me
2005-07-02T11:31:00.000Z	sjmurdoch	bob2	An initrd is a pain in the ass?
2005-07-02T11:31:00.000Z	bob2	sjmurdoch	yes
2005-07-02T11:32:00.000Z	sjmurdoch	bob2	In what way, I haven't had any problems in the past, and have used it because it was the Woody default
2005-07-02T11:32:00.000Z	bob2	sjmurdoch	no, initrds are not the default on woody
2005-07-02T11:34:00.000Z	sjmurdoch	bob2	Isn't kernel-image built with a initrd  - I certainly have an initrd from the default kernel lying around?
2005-07-02T11:34:00.000Z	bob2	sjmurdoch	kernel-image, yes, but the default kernel is not from a kernel-image package
2005-07-02T11:35:00.000Z	sjmurdoch	bob2	Thanks for your help
