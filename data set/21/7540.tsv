2006-10-13T06:58:00.000Z	sonium_		does anyone know what a "UI selector" is?
2006-10-13T06:58:00.000Z	sonium_		I did a bug report an they asked me "you use edgy? what selector for the UI do you use?"
2006-10-13T06:59:00.000Z	sonium_		in the context of gnome-sound-properties
2006-10-13T06:59:00.000Z	sonium_		i think
2006-10-13T07:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sonium_	what user interface do you use to go to gnome-sound-properties i would image
2006-10-13T07:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak		imagine*
2006-10-13T07:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sonium_	kde gnome i would assume
2006-10-13T07:00:00.000Z	sonium_		but gnome-sound-properties _is_ the interface o_O
2006-10-13T07:01:00.000Z	sonium_		https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/control-center/+bug/44101 <- that's the whole story
2006-10-13T07:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sonium_	not really qt and gtk draw windows differnetly
2006-10-13T07:01:00.000Z	sonium_		but gnome only uses gtk afaik
2006-10-13T07:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sonium_	sort of
2006-10-13T07:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sonium_	give me a min let me ping seb and ask him what he means
2006-10-13T07:02:00.000Z	sonium_		just ask Eldin
2006-10-13T07:03:00.000Z	sonium_		but don't expect an answer ;)

2006-10-13T07:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak		s/ar eyou/are you
2006-10-13T07:04:00.000Z	sonium_	gnomefreak	in this case I opened it from bash, but actually I didn't seem to matter
2006-10-13T07:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sonium_	there are 4 combo lists on the first tab and one on the second what one are you using
2006-10-13T07:07:00.000Z	sonium_	gnomefreak	wouldn't it make more sense to talk directly with Seb?
