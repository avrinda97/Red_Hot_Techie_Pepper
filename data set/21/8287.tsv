2007-05-21T08:31:00.000Z	NET||abuse	mc44	hmm, did a search on aptitude, no sign of madwifi-tools or any package with madwifi

2007-05-21T08:34:00.000Z	NET||abuse	mc44	hheh,, doesn't help me right this minute though.. and i dread to think of getting all my bits working again,, feisty has a few borked python and java dependancies at the moment
2007-05-21T08:34:00.000Z	mc44	NET||abuse	are you sure? they work fine here
2007-05-21T08:35:00.000Z	mc44	NET||abuse	here you go http://madwifi.org/wiki/UserDocs/Distro/Ubuntu
2007-05-21T08:35:00.000Z	mc44	NET||abuse	see the instructions for edgy
2007-05-21T08:35:00.000Z	NET||abuse	mc44	democracy has issues with python libraries, and i use zend studio, which broke on my last test install 2 weeks ago
2007-05-21T08:36:00.000Z	NET||abuse	mc44	:) cheers
2007-05-21T08:39:00.000Z	NET||abuse	mc44	thanks, that got the program installed for me :)
2007-05-21T08:39:00.000Z	NET||abuse	mc44	wonder if i should apply to backports for that
2007-05-21T08:39:00.000Z	mc44	NET||abuse	could do, though no one sensible uses edgy anymore :P
