2011-06-28T03:03:00.000Z	AlphaPsi		Hmm I think there my harddrive already has 2-3 partitions
2011-06-28T03:04:00.000Z	AlphaPsi		But I'm not sure, the C drive and the D drive, are those partitions?
2011-06-28T03:04:00.000Z	AlphaPsi		I don't think so
2011-06-28T03:04:00.000Z	AlphaPsi		ACER (C:) drive, and the DATA (D:) drive
2011-06-28T03:05:00.000Z	AlphaPsi		But the DATA drive has almost nothing in it
2011-06-28T03:06:00.000Z	AlphaPsi		145 GB
2011-06-28T03:06:00.000Z	AlphaPsi		145
2011-06-28T03:06:00.000Z	AlphaPsi		So I think my harddrive is split
2011-06-28T03:07:00.000Z	AlphaPsi		Theres nothing in the DATA (D:) drive though, and stuff is in the ACER (C:) drive
2011-06-28T03:07:00.000Z	AlphaPsi		Wait whats the difference?
2011-06-28T03:08:00.000Z	mneptok	AlphaPsi	the difference between "a pie" and "a slice of pie"
2011-06-28T03:11:00.000Z	mneptok	AlphaPsi	is it a drive, or a partition of a drive?
2011-06-28T03:11:00.000Z	mneptok	AlphaPsi	if you don't know, it's time to find out.
2011-06-28T03:15:00.000Z	mneptok	AlphaPsi	you have one physical hard disk that has been partitioned.
2011-06-28T03:18:00.000Z	mneptok	AlphaPsi	i would strongly suggest that before you investigate alternate OSes further you learn the difference between disks and partitions. otherwise you could really hose your system.
2011-06-28T03:25:00.000Z	mneptok	AlphaPsi	this is like you asking for directions on the highway, and when we tell you to steer left, you answer "STEER?! What the heck is 'steering'?!"
2011-06-28T03:26:00.000Z	mneptok	AlphaPsi	you have to walk before you can run.
2011-06-28T03:27:00.000Z	mneptok	AlphaPsi	what is a partition? how many primary partitions can an MSDOS disklabeled machine have? what is an extended partition? what is a swap partition? do i need one? how do i delete an existing partition in Windows and free the space for another OS?
2011-06-28T03:29:00.000Z	mneptok	AlphaPsi	so ... how many primary partitions can be on a disk with an MSDOS disklabel?
2011-06-28T03:32:00.000Z	mneptok	AlphaPsi	do you really want to be guessing as Linux formats huge portions of your hard drive? i wouldn't.
2011-06-28T03:35:00.000Z	mneptok	AlphaPsi	it's the same as knowing every road sign shape before you get your driver's license. there are just some things you should know.
