2005-05-10T09:57:00.000Z	karljp		ahh, I need to run it set it up, "setting up" didn't do it
2005-05-10T09:59:00.000Z	karljp		what is the name of the top panel? so that I can restart it?
2005-05-10T09:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	gnome-panel ( but that's both)
2005-05-10T10:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	killall gnome-panel
2005-05-10T10:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	a bit drastic, but you can move your ~/.gnome and .gnome2 files and restart...
2005-05-10T10:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	should work OK - just logout/login afterwards
2005-05-10T10:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	starting to sound a bit serious...
2005-05-11T06:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	there are quite a few linux mags
2005-05-11T06:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	Linux Journal, linux format...
2005-05-11T06:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	heh - they are usually better
2005-05-11T06:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	sometimes rather technical
2005-05-11T05:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	;)
2005-05-20T09:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	totem is a front end - you can use totem-gstreamer or totem-xine
2005-05-20T09:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	totem-xine looks exactly like totem-gstreamer
2005-05-20T09:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	it depends on whether you want stuff that works, or want to contribute to the "way of the future" i guess
2005-05-20T09:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	of course he has that freedom: but it's irresponsible use of freedom
2005-05-20T09:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	I don't decide it: but I am entitled to judge, just as you are. The idea that one should refrain from using judgment is equally absurd
2005-05-20T09:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	you seem blissfully unaware of hoe spammers use people's insecure computers to do their work
2005-05-20T09:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	why give those people easy access to machines that aren't theirs?
2005-05-20T09:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	rubbish - he just needs to dist-upgrade
2005-05-20T09:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karljp	you are assuming a level of sophistication I doubt exists for such as sauli
