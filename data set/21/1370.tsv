2010-10-10T21:06:00.000Z	stnick		How do I identify my nick on this channel? I can't figure it out and it keeps blocking me from talking
2010-10-10T21:07:00.000Z	stnick		For the moment
2010-10-10T21:08:00.000Z	stnick		Hmm. Seems to be taking its time in blocking me this time. Anyway, I'm trying to dual boot Ubuntu and Windows 7. I created the partitions for Ubuntu and installed it, but now neither will load. It just says"
2010-10-10T21:08:00.000Z	stnick		non-system disk or disk error replace and strike any key when ready
2010-10-10T21:09:00.000Z	lil_e	stnick	i had the same issue with my tri-boot....was a bootloader issue
2010-10-10T21:11:00.000Z	lil_e	stnick	you can change that in the BIOPS or hitting the boot menu
2010-10-10T21:14:00.000Z	lil_e	stnick	you might be able to modify the partitions through GParted ( or whatever ) and make another partition bootable though
2010-10-10T21:20:00.000Z	lil_e	stnick	there isnt XChat already installed? apps>internet>XChat IRC
2010-10-10T21:20:00.000Z	stnick	lil_e	I'm on Windows 7 at the moment, not Ubuntu
2010-10-10T21:23:00.000Z	lil_e	stnick	thats the bootlaoder
2010-10-10T21:24:00.000Z	stnick	lil_e	To edit the linux partition to bootable do I right click the extended partition, click "flags" and check "boot"?
2010-10-10T21:25:00.000Z	lil_e	stnick	not sure i know there is a way to edit the start up options for GRUB though... yes that will make it bootable, not sure if the Loader will interfere or not
2010-10-10T21:25:00.000Z	stnick	lil_e	set it to bootable. Gonna see if it boots up now
2010-10-10T21:26:00.000Z	lil_e	stnick	have you tried running recover ( or whatever) from your install CD?
2010-10-10T21:26:00.000Z	stnick	lil_e	That seems to have made a difference. I now get "error: file not found"
2010-10-10T21:27:00.000Z	stnick	lil_e	then underneath it "grub rescue>" and a blinking cursor
2010-10-10T21:27:00.000Z	lil_e	stnick	i meant the linux distro you used to install
2010-10-10T21:27:00.000Z	stnick	lil_e	haven't tried that. Hold on a second
2010-10-10T21:28:00.000Z	lil_e	stnick	also try making that 1mb partion "not bootable   or " do not usse partition"\
2010-10-10T21:28:00.000Z	stnick	lil_e	is there a private chat function in the web client?
2010-10-10T21:29:00.000Z	stnick	lil_e	I'm back in Ubuntu. How do I run the "recover" thing?
