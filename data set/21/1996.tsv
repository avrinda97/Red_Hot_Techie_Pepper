2010-02-21T07:55:00.000Z	stevebuntu		what does the arow aboc=ve a folder mean ?
2010-02-21T07:55:00.000Z	stevebuntu		above
2010-02-21T07:57:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	it's a link?
2010-02-21T07:58:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	define "arrow"..
2010-02-21T08:01:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	For example, the "build" directory is a link (symlink), if you do  ls -l /lib/modules/2.6.31-17-generic/build you'll see whare the link leads to..
2010-02-21T08:02:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	substituting the version number for the one relevant in your case (that was a command in terminal.
2010-02-21T08:02:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	or simply look at the properties of it in the file browser, and it should say that it's a link and where it leads
2010-02-21T08:04:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	do you have the corresponding "link-target" in /usr/src ?
2010-02-21T08:07:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	I'm not quite sure how to go about fixing it though, that seems like the kernel hasn't been installed properly, in what way did you install it?
2010-02-21T08:20:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	hold down shift when booting and you'll get to the menu to choose kernel version, provided you have it installed.
2010-02-21T08:24:00.000Z	stevebuntu	arand	that worked will it now always boot using this kernel ?
2010-02-21T08:35:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	Where from did you install it?
2010-02-21T08:26:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	no, you can either uninstall the new one if you don't want it or set a default boot entry number in /etc/default/grub
2010-02-21T08:29:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	what was the exact name of the package you installed
2010-02-21T08:45:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	Was it something like here you got it from: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.32/
2010-02-21T08:52:00.000Z	stevebuntu	arand	nope
2010-02-21T08:54:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	and which of the packages there did you install?
2010-02-21T09:07:00.000Z	stevebuntu	arand	http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.32/linux-source-2.6.32_2.6.32-020632_all.deb
2010-02-21T09:10:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	ok, that is the source code  you've installed, not the actual bootable images, you want the -image and -headers packages instead (i386 for 32bit and amd64 for 64bit)
2010-02-21T09:20:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	installing those 3 packages should update the boot list and set the new version as the default boot entry, if you want you could uninstall the source package since I think you won't be using it (unless you want to start coding on the kernel code....)
2010-02-21T09:21:00.000Z	arand	stevebuntu	2xheaders 1ximage two of which are 32bit/64bit specific.
