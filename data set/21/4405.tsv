2008-05-05T11:12:00.000Z	s_spiff		hey can someone help me out with screen resolution and nvidia drivers?
2008-05-05T11:13:00.000Z	TheBigNoob	s_spiff	what do you need?
2008-05-05T11:13:00.000Z	s_spiff	TheBigNoob	on Gutsy I had resolutions greated than 1024x786.. since ugrading to hardy, and installing drivers using EnvyNG.. i get only 1024x786
2008-05-05T11:15:00.000Z	TheBigNoob	s_spiff	EnvyNG im pretty sure is only available for Gusty
2008-05-05T11:15:00.000Z	TheBigNoob	s_spiff	what video card do you have?
2008-05-05T11:15:00.000Z	s_spiff	TheBigNoob	yup. its specifically made for Gutsy..
2008-05-05T11:15:00.000Z	s_spiff	TheBigNoob	I have a NVidia 6100 onboard a Gigabyte motherboard.
2008-05-05T11:16:00.000Z	TheBigNoob	s_spiff	I know it would probably be contradictory but when I upgraded(downgraded?) to the offical nvidia drivers, I got full resolution options
2008-05-05T11:16:00.000Z	TheBigNoob	s_spiff	you looked into your xorg.conf correcT?
2008-05-05T11:17:00.000Z	s_spiff	TheBigNoob	nopes. will it help? I instead tried editing using the NVidia Server Settings , but every time I tried to use a higher resolution, the screen came out all screwed up!
2008-05-05T11:18:00.000Z	TheBigNoob	s_spiff	what architecture are you using?
2008-05-05T11:18:00.000Z	s_spiff	TheBigNoob	x64 :0
2008-05-05T11:19:00.000Z	TheBigNoob	s_spiff	i have an 8800GTS and it was a pain in the rear end trying to set up my video settings
2008-05-05T11:19:00.000Z	TheBigNoob	s_spiff	sudo apt-get nvidia-settings  might help
2008-05-05T11:20:00.000Z	s_spiff	TheBigNoob	till date never had issues with older versions of Ubuntu.. its only in hardy heron that i'm having this issue. Although, on xp, the max resolution I can go to is 1024x786. Its just that I liked ubuntu giving me higher resolutions :P
2008-05-05T11:20:00.000Z	TheBigNoob	s_spiff	what kind of monitor you have?
2008-05-05T11:21:00.000Z	s_spiff	TheBigNoob	a Samsung793s CRT monitor , 21 inch :P
2008-05-05T11:22:00.000Z	TheBigNoob	s_spiff	that is odd, it took me 2 days to try and figure out how to force my monitor to run at a certain refresh rate
2008-05-05T11:22:00.000Z	TheBigNoob	s_spiff	good game nvidia
2008-05-05T11:23:00.000Z	s_spiff	TheBigNoob	do you have ahowto about setting refresh rates? cus I know that if I can set up the refresh rate properly, I can get a higer resolution.
2008-05-05T11:27:00.000Z	s_spiff	TheBigNoob	i ended up using a 1208x1024 resolution..and selecting a 60Hz refresh rate... but the trasparent terminal which i had embedded on my desktop now seems to have a slight shadow :( any ideas?
