2005-07-20T15:23:00.000Z	guillem		There is also the option of nxserver/client. That seems pretty compact. Anyone has good experiences with that? Anyone using freenx, besides?
2005-07-20T15:23:00.000Z	Seveas	guillem	freenx rocks
2005-07-20T15:24:00.000Z	guillem	Seveas	really? I will give it a try. On the client side, are you using nxclient or freenx client?
2005-07-20T15:24:00.000Z	Seveas	guillem	nomachine NX client and freenx server
2005-07-20T15:25:00.000Z	Seveas	guillem	client on both windows and Ubuntu machines
2005-07-20T15:25:00.000Z	guillem	Seveas	sweet- I've downloaded freenx_0.4.1-0alpha5_all.deb, it is safe to install that?
2005-07-20T15:25:00.000Z	Seveas	guillem	I installed it from backports, works fine
2005-07-20T15:26:00.000Z	guillem	Seveas	wow I have not yet included backpors repositories.. And I would like not to do if I can avoid it... so can I access the deb file directly somehow?
2005-07-20T15:26:00.000Z	Seveas	guillem	you can simply surf to the backports archive or enable backports, install freenx and disable backports
2005-07-20T15:27:00.000Z	guillem	Seveas	I really appreciate your help. Thank you very much!
2005-08-22T14:09:00.000Z	Seveas	guillem	add that parameter to the #kopt line
2005-08-23T16:15:00.000Z	Seveas	guillem	dma turned on?
2005-08-23T16:15:00.000Z	guillem	Seveas	how do I turn it on?
2005-08-23T16:17:00.000Z	Seveas	guillem	ubotu just told you something about dma
2005-08-23T16:18:00.000Z	guillem	Seveas	can I have the drive mounted or do I have to umount, hdparm and mount again?
2005-08-23T16:18:00.000Z	Seveas	guillem	hehe, !dma is for in this channel
2005-08-23T16:19:00.000Z	guillem	Seveas	HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted
2005-08-23T16:20:00.000Z	Seveas	guillem	sudo hdparm
2005-08-23T16:20:00.000Z	guillem	Seveas	 I did sudo...
2005-08-23T16:23:00.000Z	guillem	Seveas	my drive refuses changing the DMA
2005-08-23T16:28:00.000Z	guillem	Seveas	btw, hdparm -i tells me the drive is using udma2, is that enough?
