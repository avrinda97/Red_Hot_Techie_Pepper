2007-11-19T04:49:00.000Z	sysme		Can someone of you help me setting up my fluxbox ?
2007-11-19T04:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 set up in what way?
2007-11-19T04:50:00.000Z	sysme	Dr_willis	you've read what i mean ?
2007-11-19T04:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 i would say check the fluxbox docs/manpage/homepage. - i think they go in .fluxbox/themes
2007-11-19T04:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 that would be for the root users personal styles.  You running fluxboxc as root? WHY?
2007-11-19T04:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 man fluxstyle has a lot of info ->  There are many places to store your styles, the most common is in your ~/.fluxbox/styles directory.
2007-11-19T04:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 so you installed it system wide.. make a .fluxbox/styles dir
2007-11-19T04:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 yes. each user can have their own styles
2007-11-19T04:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 its .fluxbox/styles
2007-11-19T04:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 NOTE the .
2007-11-19T04:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 try a 'cd .fluxbox'
2007-11-19T04:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 a . normally 'hides' a direcory/file
2007-11-19T04:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 ls -a   should show it
2007-11-19T05:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 you make a styles dir and the files go in that dir.
2007-11-19T05:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 you may want to install 'mc' and learn to use it.
2007-11-19T05:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 notice wher ei just said to learn to use mc.. :) thats the easy way.
2007-11-19T05:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 or go read a few bash tutorials and  learn to use  the 'cp' command. OR use the gnome file manager and open up .fluxbox (just type in the address)
2007-11-19T05:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 mc is like the #1 thing i always install on a disrto :)
2007-11-19T05:10:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	 i dont use msn.. :)
2007-11-19T05:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sysme	  check the styles menu now. You may need to restart fluxbox
