2009-08-14T18:06:00.000Z	shahzad		actually i unable to hibernate in my ubuntu jauty
2009-08-14T18:07:00.000Z	shahzad		when i press hibernate it goes to black screen and then shutdown
2009-08-14T18:07:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	shahzad	thats what hibernate does
2009-08-14T18:09:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	shahzad	so when you start it up again your application that were open on shutdown are no longer there?
2009-08-14T18:15:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	shahzad	how big is your swap partition?
2009-08-14T18:16:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	shahzad	and you have 2GB of RAM installed too ?
2009-08-14T18:17:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	shahzad	you may want to try increasing your swap size by a little bit. Ubuntu forums comments seem to suggest that would help
2009-08-14T18:19:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	shahzad	yes. id reccomend a live version of Gparted available here: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
2009-08-14T18:20:00.000Z	shahzad	b3rz3rk3r	i got gparted in my ubuntu
2009-08-14T18:21:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	shahzad	right, but you wont be able to edit your current partition because it is mounted. so you need the live cd to do so
2009-08-14T18:22:00.000Z	shahzad	b3rz3rk3r	i need to resize my swap partition so i unmount it first, and then resize it, is it possible
2009-08-14T18:23:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	shahzad	no, you will need to unmount your ext4 and resize, to get space for your swap first, then give more swap space. so you need the livecd. its a small dl
2009-08-14T18:25:00.000Z	shahzad	b3rz3rk3r	actually the ext4 from which i wanna get space is not a root containing drive. so that i m asking is it possible to get space from it for my swap
2009-08-14T18:25:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	shahzad	yes it is. just resize it first, then use the space for more swap
2009-08-14T18:31:00.000Z	shahzad	b3rz3rk3r	i have resize my ext4 and get 2 gb space from it as unalocated space. now how could i add it in my swap space
2009-08-14T18:32:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	shahzad	using the gparted livecd just extend the swap space
2009-08-14T18:33:00.000Z	shahzad	b3rz3rk3r	once again i have to use live cd. no other solution?
