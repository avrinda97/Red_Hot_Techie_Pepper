2010-07-11T23:01:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong		i dont know what happened but when I try to shift my applications to other workspace....it shows me Desk 1 (1), Desk 2 (2)..... and so on instead of normally showing Desk 1, Desk 2...and my applications seems to be running slower than usual
2010-07-11T23:03:00.000Z	slidinghorn	PerryArmstrong	please don't repeat your problem quickly...sometimes answers aren't available.  could you post a screenshot to http://tinyurl.com/imagebin?
2010-07-11T23:04:00.000Z	slidinghorn	PerryArmstrong	(the imagebin should be without the "?" -- sorry)    :)
2010-07-11T23:04:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	slidinghorn	what screenshot should i show
2010-07-11T23:05:00.000Z	slidinghorn	PerryArmstrong	something that shows your issue, because (at least to me) it didn't make very much sense...
2010-07-11T23:08:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	slidinghorn	see this my desktop folder: http://imagebin.org/104882
2010-07-11T23:08:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	slidinghorn	and this is my actual desktop showing no files or folders: http://imagebin.org/104884
2010-07-11T23:09:00.000Z	slidinghorn	PerryArmstrong	your screenshots don't sho any problems that I can see...could you please try to explain your problem in detail?  Please see the factoid below
2010-07-11T23:10:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	slidinghorn	did you see my desktop folder in the 1st screenshot showing files and folders....and in the 2nd screen shot is the desktop where i dont see the files
2010-07-11T23:11:00.000Z	slidinghorn	PerryArmstrong	I saw both...and there's no indication of anything you were talking about when you originally described your issue
2010-07-11T23:13:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	slidinghorn	originally i talked about something else i understand....i'll tell what i was telling you before.....in case you want to shift your firefox application from Workspace 1 to worskpace 2..... you right click it and select Move to another Workspace....then you select Desk 1 or Desk 2 or so on...right...did you get me till here??
2010-07-11T23:13:00.000Z	slidinghorn	PerryArmstrong	got you so far :)
2010-07-11T23:14:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	slidinghorn	but it no longer shows me that way....instead of showing me Desk 1, Desk 2....it shows me the options as Desk 1 (1), Desk 2 (2) and so on...... got it??
2010-07-11T23:15:00.000Z	slidinghorn	PerryArmstrong	Ok I understand...is it just with firefox or is it with all applications?
2010-07-11T23:15:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	slidinghorn	with all applications
2010-07-11T23:16:00.000Z	slidinghorn	PerryArmstrong	ok...give me a few minutes to see if I can find anything that will help
2010-07-11T23:16:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	slidinghorn	and my 2nd problem is that my desktop is not showing me the files i originally had
2010-07-11T23:16:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	slidinghorn	okk take your time...
