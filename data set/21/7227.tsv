2010-06-15T09:12:00.000Z	hypatia		i'm trying to upgrade an 8.04 desktop to 10.04, and do-release-upgrade is saying no new release found.  i've gone into software sources and changed "never" to "LTS" - is there anything else i'm missing?
2010-06-15T09:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hypatia	Which apt mirror are you using?
2010-06-15T09:13:00.000Z	hypatia	Jordan_U	osuosl
2010-06-15T09:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hypatia	Try using the main mirror.
2010-06-15T09:13:00.000Z	hypatia	Jordan_U	will do, thanks!
2010-06-15T09:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hypatia	You're welcome.
2010-06-15T09:16:00.000Z	hypatia	Jordan_U	any other ideas? didn't work :(
2010-06-15T09:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hypatia	Software Sources may have already done this, but try step2, "edit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades and set Prompt=normal", from http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade
2010-06-15T09:20:00.000Z	hypatia	Jordan_U	i don't want normal, i want LTS -> LTS :/
2010-06-15T09:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hypatia	Sorry, meant to post the 8.04 to 10.04 instructions, basically replace "normal" with "lts"
2010-06-15T09:22:00.000Z	hypatia	Jordan_U	yeah it's already set to lts
2010-06-15T09:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hypatia	I assume you ran "sudo apt-get update" after changing mirrors?
2010-06-15T09:24:00.000Z	hypatia	Jordan_U	sudo do-release-upgrade --devel-release ended
2010-06-15T09:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hypatia	Be *absolutely* sure that isn't going to upgrade you to 10.10. It shouldn't, but --devel-release also shouldn't be needed.
2010-06-15T09:26:00.000Z	hypatia	Jordan_U	says lucid all over it, but mucho thanks for the warning
2010-06-15T09:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hypatia	NVM, that is in the official instructions. That's really odd. Maybe they're only upgrading servers LTS to LTS after 10.04.1 ?
2011-02-15T06:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hypatia	Actually I believe that with PAM it should.
2011-02-15T06:40:00.000Z	hypatia	Jordan_U	if you use passwd it definietly doesn't change it
2011-02-15T06:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hypatia	Did you run passwd as root or as the user whose password you were changing?
2011-02-15T06:45:00.000Z	hypatia	Jordan_U	as the user, that might have done it :)
2011-02-15T06:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hypatia	When changing the password using just "passwd", running as the user whose password is being changed, PAM should cause the password for the encrypted home directory to be changed to. This doesn't happen when you use passwd as root because you are never prompted for the user's password, which is required to make the change.
