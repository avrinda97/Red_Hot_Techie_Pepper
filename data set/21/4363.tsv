2008-08-21T15:56:00.000Z	hoonteke		there's a good introductory article to administration with X
2008-08-21T15:56:00.000Z	hoonteke		and other tools.
2008-08-21T15:56:00.000Z	flajann	hoonteke	if you ever have to frell about with Oracle(!), you'll need X installed. I would not wish that on my worst enemy -- well, maybe I would!
2008-08-21T15:57:00.000Z	hoonteke	flajann	it has been a while since I've messed with oracle, but I've never needed an X server on the server itself
2008-08-21T15:58:00.000Z	flajann	hoonteke	normally you wouldn't. I don't have X on any servers I work on -- except those with Oracle installations. Go figure.
2008-08-21T15:58:00.000Z	hoonteke	flajann	yeah, I migrated to Postgres in the 8.0 series.
2008-08-21T16:00:00.000Z	flajann	hoonteke	I had to deal with a Doubleclick installation, which *requires* Oracle, but could've just as easily been written to use MySQL or postgres
2008-08-21T16:01:00.000Z	hoonteke	flajann	yep, about 3-4 years ago, we made a decision on the database end of things: we're going with postgres.  If it didn't support postgres, we weren't going to use it.
2008-08-21T16:02:00.000Z	flajann	hoonteke	got into a nasty debate with someone local as to whether Postgres is better than MySQL. That raised a lot of interesting issues, actually.
2008-08-21T16:03:00.000Z	hoonteke	flajann	hehe, yep.  Been down that road as well
2008-08-21T16:05:00.000Z	flajann	hoonteke	That was the case. MySQL is getting better with the multicore issues, but still has some way to go.
2008-08-21T16:05:00.000Z	hoonteke	flajann	yeah, it's hard to compare them both since they're both constantly evolving
2008-08-21T16:07:00.000Z	flajann	hoonteke	at my shop, we are using MySQL on big quad-core boxes to support 50,000+ simultaneous users sending messages back and forth, chat, and a blizzard of other stuff...
2008-08-21T16:07:00.000Z	hoonteke	flajann	about a year ago, this was handy: http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Why_PostgreSQL_Instead_of_MySQL:_Comparing_Reliability_and_Speed_in_2007
2008-08-21T16:09:00.000Z	flajann	hoonteke	Yes, a year ago. Now, it'll have to be redone. :-)
2008-08-21T16:09:00.000Z	hoonteke	flajann	yeah, I'm not at all dissing MySQL.  It's got it's niche, and clearly (since Google uses it, e.g.) it works.  Hard to argue with *it works*.  On the other hand, it's not a solution that will work for our shop
2008-08-21T16:10:00.000Z	flajann	hoonteke	as always, it's the best tool for the job. At my shop, MySQL is the main workhorse, but we also have MSSQL and Oracle here.
2008-08-21T16:11:00.000Z	hoonteke	flajann	hmm, so I hadn't looked at that link in a while.  I'm actually impressed that it's still somewhat relevant.
2008-08-21T16:12:00.000Z	hoonteke	flajann	heh, that's been the april fools joke on slashdot for a couple of years running, I think.
2008-08-21T16:13:00.000Z	flajann	hoonteke	I'm serious, though -- would make for a cool state of affairs...
2008-08-21T16:13:00.000Z	hoonteke	flajann	:-)
