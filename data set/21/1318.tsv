2011-10-12T22:26:00.000Z	tsaknorris		i can see all the iphone files on nautilus, but i wanna use console
2011-10-12T22:27:00.000Z	christofer	tsaknorris	have you checked /media/?

2011-10-12T22:28:00.000Z	tsaknorris		sudo fdisk -l doesnt work or plain mount command
2011-10-12T22:28:00.000Z	tsaknorris		well they work but they cant show me the iphone mount
2011-10-12T22:29:00.000Z	christofer	tsaknorris	hmm, maybe a long shot, but if you right-click in the iphone folder in nautilus and choose properties, what does it say under location?

2011-10-12T22:36:00.000Z	christofer	tsaknorris	another longshot, but can https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPhone#Device_full.2C_.22how_were_I_to_know.3F.22 help in any way?
2011-10-12T22:39:00.000Z	tsaknorris	christofer	 thanks man but i think this one is too big cake for me :D  apple is using some weird magic or the moon isnt in right angle for me.
2011-10-12T22:43:00.000Z	tsaknorris	christofer	 its that Apple FIle Connection protocol AFC (i would need to jailbrake it) plah...ok next question how i can see the files what insert to iphone?
2011-10-12T22:44:00.000Z	tsaknorris	christofer	files i have inserted to phone. how i can see them
2011-10-12T22:45:00.000Z	christofer	tsaknorris	it doesnt seem like you can access the drive directly, but if you run the command stated in the help documentation, can you access the folders it outputs?
2011-10-12T22:47:00.000Z	tsaknorris	christofer	what command you want to me to run ( ihave looked that url)
2011-10-12T22:48:00.000Z	tsaknorris	christofer	ifuse?
2011-10-12T22:50:00.000Z	christofer	tsaknorris	Seems like you have to use iTunnel, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPhone#iTunnel and then use ssh to log in on the device.
2011-10-12T22:52:00.000Z	tsaknorris	christofer	 yeah i can see that, but anyway lets go to that other problem... how i can open let say mp3 file what i move to my phone?
