2012-05-25T22:51:00.000Z	zacktu		a friend gave me a computer -- installs of windows xp and ubuntu won't boot -- system rescue cd will find ubuntu and boot it, but ubuntu won't boot off the disk -- i've tried fixmbr and fixboot for windows w/ no success -- is it time to trash the disk?
2012-05-25T22:53:00.000Z	zbeefy	zacktu	you could check the drive under ubuntu live CD using Disk Utility
2012-05-25T22:53:00.000Z	zacktu	zbeefy	disk utility says the disk is ok
2012-05-25T22:54:00.000Z	zbeefy	zacktu	then it must be okay, format it in Disk Utility
2012-05-25T22:54:00.000Z	zbeefy	zacktu	and assign a new partition table
2012-05-25T22:54:00.000Z	zbeefy	zacktu	but remember to format the drive, not the partition
2012-05-25T22:58:00.000Z	zacktu	zbeefy	i let ubuntu have the entire drive when doing the install -- most of the drive was one partition, with also a partition for swap and one more i think
2012-05-25T22:58:00.000Z	zbeefy	zacktu	and you installed grub on /dev/sda ?
2012-05-25T23:00:00.000Z	zacktu	zbeefy	didn't install grub as a separate activity -- it's not been necessary for any installs that i have done before
2012-05-25T23:00:00.000Z	zbeefy	zacktu	then it installed itself automatically, and what, it didn't boot after that?
2012-05-25T23:02:00.000Z	zacktu	zbeefy	it won't boot -- all i get is a blinking cursor
2012-05-25T23:02:00.000Z	zbeefy	zacktu	at which point, since the beginning of the bootup process? Is BIOS set to boot off of this drive?
2012-05-25T23:04:00.000Z	zacktu	zbeefy	i've had it as the top -- also below the CD and used bios to select the hard drive when i wanted to test so i know that i'm trying to boot from the disk
2012-05-25T23:06:00.000Z	zacktu	zbeefy	i've booted system rescue cd and tried 2 options: 1) find a linux system and boot it; 2) boot from the hard disk ---- #1 works and #2 doesn't
2012-05-25T23:06:00.000Z	zbeefy	zacktu	linux will be read from the CD into the RAM, so it will work
2012-05-25T23:07:00.000Z	zbeefy	zacktu	is it a laptop?
2012-05-25T23:08:00.000Z	zbeefy	zacktu	try manually disconnecting the drive and connecting it back
2012-05-25T23:10:00.000Z	zacktu	zbeefy	this is a dell desktop -- i thought it would be a nice sandbox
2012-05-25T23:11:00.000Z	zacktu	zbeefy	i'll also ready over the suggestions on the thread that the bot sent - thanks for your help
2012-05-25T23:11:00.000Z	zbeefy	zacktu	I remember I had problems like that once but that was because of bad sectors. I could only use the drive for storage.
2012-05-25T23:12:00.000Z	zbeefy	zacktu	sorry I couldn't resolve it
