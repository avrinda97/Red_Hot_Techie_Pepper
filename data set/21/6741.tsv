2007-02-05T09:23:00.000Z	mastroDani	francois	but if i try apt-get install hotplug it say that there's udev and module-init-tools that substitute it
2007-02-05T09:24:00.000Z	francois	mastroDani	i don't beleive you need that directory anymore, let me look

2007-02-05T09:28:00.000Z	francois	mastroDani	it explains about firmware, for your scanner, and how to get it working
2007-02-05T09:28:00.000Z	mastroDani	francois	wait i read it
2007-02-05T09:29:00.000Z	mastroDani	francois	are you sure? i don't find CX 3650 there
2007-02-05T09:29:00.000Z	francois	mastroDani	it doesn't matter the make, you have to follow the same steps to get the firmware working,
2007-02-05T09:29:00.000Z	francois	mastroDani	just use the same steps, but for your scanner
2007-02-05T09:30:00.000Z	mastroDani	francois	i don't have a firmware (.bin)
2007-02-05T09:30:00.000Z	francois	mastroDani	you can prolly find it on the cd that came with your scanner, or online, at their website
2007-02-05T09:54:00.000Z	mastroDani	francois	hey mate! my scanner work.. i simply follower the first part of the tutoria i gave you (editing /etc/sane.d/epson.conf) and then i rebooted
2007-02-05T09:54:00.000Z	francois	mastroDani	awsome, you should post a forum about it, to help others
