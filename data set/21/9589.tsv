2005-08-26T09:51:00.000Z	miq		hi
2005-08-26T09:52:00.000Z	miq		i recently installed ubuntu on two brand-new athlon64 machines (the x86 version)
2005-08-26T09:52:00.000Z	miq		and faced the one problem:
2005-08-26T09:52:00.000Z	miq		dma access could not be enabled for the ide-devices
2005-08-26T09:53:00.000Z	miq		one board had an nforce4 the other an via K800 or something chipset
2005-08-26T09:53:00.000Z	miq		the "fix" for my nforce4 machine was to compile the amd-ide driver *into* the kernel
2005-08-26T09:54:00.000Z	miq		and not using it as a module
2005-08-26T09:54:00.000Z	miq		so it *could* be a kernel bug
2005-08-26T09:54:00.000Z	miq		is something like that known?
2005-08-26T09:54:00.000Z	miq		i found one or two similar hints on the net
2005-08-26T09:55:00.000Z	funkyHat	miq	did you say you were using the x86 version? not the x86-64 version?
2005-08-26T09:55:00.000Z	funkyHat		_that_ could be the bug ;)
2005-08-26T09:55:00.000Z	miq		well, athlon64 are quite able to run 32-bit OSes
2005-08-26T09:56:00.000Z	funkyHat		yes, but why should ubuntu 32 bit be configured to work correctly on a 64 bit machine, when there is a 64 bit version available?
2005-08-26T09:56:00.000Z	miq		and i want to run the 32bit one because some crucial stuff like w32codecs are much easier to run on 32bit
2005-08-26T09:56:00.000Z	miq		and flashplugin etc.
2005-08-26T09:57:00.000Z	miq		currently the 32bit ubuntu is much less of an hassle
2005-08-26T09:57:00.000Z	miq		i tried the amd64 one before
2005-08-26T09:57:00.000Z	miq		imho its not "there" yet
2005-08-26T09:58:00.000Z	funkyHat	miq	not having a dig, but my response would be to notify people about the issues with the x86-64 version, rather than post bugs about the x86 version running on amd64
2005-08-26T09:58:00.000Z	miq	funkyHat	well, the issues about x86-64 are well known
