2005-10-02T05:05:00.000Z	nootrope		howdy. so, i've managed to boot up using the live disk and it has found my wireless access point, but it won't connect to the internet.
2005-10-02T05:05:00.000Z	nootrope		do i need to add anything to the route table?
2005-10-02T05:06:00.000Z	nootrope		how can i check. an ifconfig only shows the router IP, i think
2005-10-02T05:07:00.000Z	scottt	nootrope	ifconfig should show the ip you were given if it worked. otherwise dhclient -k eth0;dhclient eth0
2005-10-02T05:07:00.000Z	nootrope	scottt	ifconfig -a shows eth1 with an IP belonging to my airport. i'll try the other  command. thanks
2005-10-02T05:08:00.000Z	scottt	nootrope	uh. ok
2005-10-02T05:08:00.000Z	nootrope	scottt	uh? you saying that because i'm missing something.
2005-10-02T05:14:00.000Z	nootrope	scottt	seems that eth1 is showing the IP DHCPed by my wireless router
2005-10-02T05:15:00.000Z	nootrope	scottt	but i still can't ping anything
2005-10-02T05:15:00.000Z	scottt	nootrope	good, then you should be on the internet if your router is working properly
2005-10-02T05:15:00.000Z	nootrope		ok
2005-10-02T05:15:00.000Z	scottt	nootrope	not even the router that gave you an ip?
2005-10-02T05:16:00.000Z	nootrope	scottt	i'll try the router.
2005-10-02T05:17:00.000Z	nootrope	scottt	router iis ponging back
2005-10-02T05:17:00.000Z	nootrope	scottt	but i can't ping, say, yahoo.com
2005-10-02T05:17:00.000Z	nootrope	scottt	DNS problem?
2005-10-02T05:17:00.000Z	scottt	nootrope	then you have a problem with the router... or bad dns resolvers
2005-10-02T05:17:00.000Z	scottt	nootrope	this is not really an #ubuntu issue and its been covered 3135475349023406734 times on google. look there
2005-10-02T05:18:00.000Z	nootrope	scottt	i'm IRCing through the same router from a OS X computer
2005-10-02T05:18:00.000Z	scottt	nootrope	google how to debug network issues linux
2005-10-02T05:19:00.000Z	nootrope	scottt	i don't know if it's ubuntu or not. i figure it's just clulessness on my part about linux in general. thanks for the pointer. i'll take it from here. i appreciate your help.
