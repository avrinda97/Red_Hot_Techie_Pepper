2010-10-08T23:24:00.000Z	_raven_		gpodder: sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file - any help?
2010-10-08T23:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	_raven_	I normaly use mysql but sounds like maybe you didn't create the database or maybe you didn't give the app the priv to open it.
2010-10-08T23:27:00.000Z	_raven_	sacarlson	it seems to be broken - i could open it some hours ago
2010-10-08T23:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	_raven_	is the sqlite3 running?
2010-10-08T23:28:00.000Z	_raven_		how to find out?
2010-10-08T23:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	_raven_	does it run on the same box?  is it on the lan network?
2010-10-08T23:28:00.000Z	_raven_		???
2010-10-08T23:29:00.000Z	_raven_	sacarlson	its my desktop machine
2010-10-08T23:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	_raven_	so the app and sqlite3 must run on the same box.  so ps -A  and see if sqlite is seen in the list
2010-10-08T23:30:00.000Z	_raven_	sacarlson	it is not
2010-10-08T23:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	_raven_	well take a look in /etc/init.d  and see if you can find it and restart it
2010-10-08T23:33:00.000Z	_raven_	sacarlson	its not there
2010-10-08T23:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	_raven_	is it installed?  take a look at synaptic and see if it's checked.
2010-10-08T23:34:00.000Z	_raven_	sacarlson	no anything seems to has it deinstalled
2010-10-08T23:35:00.000Z	_raven_		but it still does not appear in init.d
2010-10-08T23:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	_raven_	it wouldn't apear in the dir /etc/init.d/ if it's not installed
2010-10-08T23:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	_raven_	or maybe sqlite doesn't start at boot?
2010-10-08T23:36:00.000Z	_raven_	sacarlson	i just reinstalled it
2010-10-08T23:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	_raven_	it might use sysv to start at boot?
2010-10-08T23:38:00.000Z	_raven_	sacarlson	how to simply start it
2010-10-08T23:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	_raven_	can you run sqlite3 at the command prompt?
