2006-05-27T06:42:00.000Z	andrejkw		I can't get my sound working with Doom 3 for some reason. Can anyone help me?
2006-05-27T06:42:00.000Z	andrejkw		Yes...
2006-05-27T06:44:00.000Z	andrejkw		icefeldr: if you still have it unpacked and compiled u can still run checkinstall in the directory have it overwite all your files and then simply remove it.
2006-05-27T06:44:00.000Z	andrejkw		still no sound in doom3 :'(
2006-05-27T06:44:00.000Z	andrejkw		This is driving me nuts, I tried everything.
2006-05-27T06:46:00.000Z	andrejkw		So... anyone has a solution to my Doom 3 dillema?
2006-05-27T06:47:00.000Z	andrejkw		Man, this is nuts, I am beginning to hate Gnome. I never had problems like this with KDE.
2006-05-27T06:47:00.000Z	andrejkw		I am running everything, I forced the game to use OSS, still no sound.
2006-05-27T06:47:00.000Z	andrejkw		I have AOSS working correctly with other programs.
2006-05-27T06:48:00.000Z	Jowi	andrejkw	just a thing... are you running esd? you can try to kill it
2006-05-27T06:48:00.000Z	andrejkw	Jowi	nope, did killall esd
2006-05-27T06:49:00.000Z	Jowi	andrejkw	and did you set up alsa (or oss) as your output sink?
2006-05-27T06:49:00.000Z	andrejkw	Jowi	ok, now you're getting a bit technical, umm, sink? You mean the one I wash my hands in?
2006-05-27T06:50:00.000Z	Jowi	andrejkw	i think the settings are in System -> preferences -> multimedia something (not using gnome here)
2006-05-27T06:51:00.000Z	andrejkw	Jowi	pipeline is esdsink
2006-05-27T06:51:00.000Z	Jowi	andrejkw	maybe you should change it to alsa or oss or whatever you use now that you have killed esd
2006-05-27T06:54:00.000Z	andrejkw	Jowi	Tried ALSA and OSS, none work.
2006-05-27T06:54:00.000Z	Jowi	andrejkw	then i have no clue. that should have done it for most programs
2006-05-27T06:56:00.000Z	Jowi	andrejkw	i need some sleep. hope it will sort itself out for you
2006-05-27T06:57:00.000Z	andrejkw	Jowi	alright, night.
