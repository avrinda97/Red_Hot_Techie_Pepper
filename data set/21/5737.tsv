2007-09-02T15:26:00.000Z	Jowi	NMajik	On my sub 1Ghz 512MB ram machine I installed ubuntu server and then added a lightweight WM, abiword instead of openoffice etc etc. a nice read is here
2007-09-02T15:27:00.000Z	NMajik	Jowi	What WM?
2007-09-02T15:27:00.000Z	Jowi	NMajik	ion3.
2007-09-02T15:28:00.000Z	NMajik	Jowi	Alright, thank you
2007-09-02T15:28:00.000Z	Jowi	NMajik	but Open box is great as well. Window Maker is good, ice-wm as well. thunar or pcmanfm as a filemanager.
2007-09-02T15:29:00.000Z	Jowi	NMajik	as long as you stay away from the heavy weights you're good to go (gnome, kde, xfce is getting there)
2007-09-02T15:29:00.000Z	NMajik	Jowi	how bad is xfce on a low spec computer?
2007-09-02T15:30:00.000Z	Jowi	NMajik	it's not bad. but it used to be much better.
2007-09-02T15:30:00.000Z	NMajik	Jowi	OK
2007-09-02T15:30:00.000Z	NMajik	Jowi	I'm doing this over VNC, will I run into problems changing over using the instructions at http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purexfce ?
2007-09-02T15:32:00.000Z	Jowi	NMajik	i doubt you will run into problems. if you do you can re-install ubuntu-desktop and you should be alright.
2007-09-02T15:33:00.000Z	NMajik	Jowi	OK. I just don't have a monitor or keyboard around so it would be something of a pain if it was to be problematic
2007-09-02T15:33:00.000Z	NMajik	Jowi	Not quite true, I'd just have too look for them
2007-09-02T15:33:00.000Z	Jowi	NMajik	depends on how you have set up vnc
2007-09-02T15:33:00.000Z	NMajik	Jowi	What should I be concerned about specifically?
2007-09-02T15:34:00.000Z	Jowi	NMajik	if you use ~/.vnc/xstartup script it's the same. if you use gnome's VINO then you probably can run into login probs.
2007-09-02T15:35:00.000Z	NMajik	Jowi	Nuts, I'm using VINO I think. I'll change that
2007-09-02T15:35:00.000Z	Jowi	NMajik	if you have an ssh server active on the remote machine then you at least have a command line backup to restore some settings.
2007-09-02T15:37:00.000Z	NMajik	Jowi	I don't... that could have been an unpleasant oversight.
2007-09-02T15:40:00.000Z	Jowi	NMajik	need to sleep. good luck with it all.
2007-09-02T15:40:00.000Z	NMajik	Jowi	Thank you very much
