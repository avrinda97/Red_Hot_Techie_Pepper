2008-10-21T16:41:00.000Z	knut_		is there a software for mounting all drives on startup (fstab) without using the terminal or a text editor?
2008-10-21T16:42:00.000Z	hischild	knut_	/etc/fstab is the location for it.
2008-10-21T16:46:00.000Z	hischild	knut_	use this command --> sudo apt-get install pastebinit && cat /etc/fstab | pastebinit
2008-10-21T16:48:00.000Z	knut_	hischild	that command was cool
2008-10-21T16:48:00.000Z	hischild	knut_	i know :-) works nearly always.
2008-10-21T17:02:00.000Z	hischild	knut_	AFTER the lines, not in front
2008-10-21T17:04:00.000Z	knut_	hischild	"/dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0" ... can i tuse the "0    0" drom that row and copy it?
2008-10-21T17:05:00.000Z	hischild	knut_	all you have to do is add 0 <space > 0 at the end of each line.
2008-10-21T17:09:00.000Z	hischild	knut_	a second :-)
2008-10-21T17:11:00.000Z	hischild	knut_	jst a second. Can you do this for me? -->
2008-10-21T17:11:00.000Z	knut_	hischild	of course
2008-10-21T17:12:00.000Z	hischild	knut_	sudo aptitude install pastebinit && dmesg > log && cat log | pastebinit && rm log
2008-10-21T17:12:00.000Z	hischild	knut_	and give that link to me here?
2008-10-21T17:12:00.000Z	hischild	knut_	uh wait .... change aptitude into apt-get
2008-10-21T17:13:00.000Z	knut_	hischild	http://pastebin.com/f2a83f8ab
2008-10-21T17:15:00.000Z	hischild	knut_	are the discs mounted?
2008-10-21T17:16:00.000Z	knut_	hischild	after your command i shoud restart?
2008-10-21T17:17:00.000Z	hischild	knut_	no .. it only gave me a log of what happens / went wrong when you started ur computer ... but nothing about the discs ...
2008-10-21T17:18:00.000Z	hischild	knut_	i'm not sure what can be wrong ... perhaps that ActionParsnip has an idea :-)
2008-10-21T17:18:00.000Z	knut_	hischild	"nosuid" ... change to "user" ??
2008-10-21T17:19:00.000Z	hischild	knut_	haven't had enough experience with fstab to say that for sure ...
