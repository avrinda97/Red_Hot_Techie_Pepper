2007-01-13T14:43:00.000Z	lgc		 Hi! Will someone help me with this problem: "scp <path>/<file>: Read-only filel system"? There is plenty of space, I do have permissions and the filesystem is reiserfs "rw". Any ideas? Thanks.

2007-01-13T14:46:00.000Z	mnoir	lgc	your question is going to be easier to answer if you provide the exact and complete command you tried
2007-01-13T14:47:00.000Z	lgc	mnoir	"scp file remote-host:
2007-01-13T14:49:00.000Z	mnoir		:)
2007-01-13T14:49:00.000Z	lgc	mnoir	"scp file remote-host", I mean.
2007-01-13T14:50:00.000Z	mnoir	lgc	no I meant the exact, literal, cut and paste it command, not your impression of a generic syntax
2007-01-13T14:51:00.000Z	lgc	mnoir	"scp madelung.c xitle.fciencias.unam.mx:~lgc" which won't mean much to you, I gather. That's why I used "my impression of a generic syntax"
2007-01-13T14:54:00.000Z	mnoir	lgc	of course it means something to me.  it means that you have not provided a target file name.  I believe that scp requires a literal target file name. try "scp madelung.c user@xitle.fciencias.unam.mx:filename" replacing filename with a name of choice and uuser with your username.  I use scp often and do not find it as intelligent about filling in the assumptions like cp is :)
2007-01-13T14:55:00.000Z	lgc	mnoir	that's the default behaviour, but let me try it so...
2007-01-13T14:56:00.000Z	lgc	mnoir	no luck!
2007-01-13T14:56:00.000Z	mnoir	lgc	!!! - same error?
2007-01-13T14:58:00.000Z	lgc	mnoir	you bet!
2007-01-13T14:58:00.000Z	mnoir	lgc	hmm - did you get the password challenge?
2007-01-13T14:59:00.000Z	lgc	mnoir	you mean if I had to type the password? Yes.
2007-01-13T15:00:00.000Z	mnoir	lgc	ok i am puzzled - i assume you have write access to your home at  xitle.fciencias.unam.mx - maybe you need to talk to the admin there - does scp work for you on your localhost? it may sound pointless but is worth a try
2007-01-13T15:01:00.000Z	lgc	mnoir	I have root access to the remote machine (though I'm not the admin).
2007-01-13T15:02:00.000Z	mnoir	lgc	i need to feed sheep but i am interested in solution - can i pm you to give my email?
2007-01-13T15:02:00.000Z	lgc	mnoir	go ahead.
2007-01-13T15:04:00.000Z	mnoir	lgc	sent - you get?
2007-01-13T15:05:00.000Z	lgc	mnoir	you want me to mail you the solution whenever we find out what is wrong?
