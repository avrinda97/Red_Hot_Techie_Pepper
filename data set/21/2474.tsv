2009-09-30T00:44:00.000Z	ububuff		I have a small ubuntu question
2009-09-30T00:44:00.000Z	ububuff		I have two laptops running ubuntu, one with Hardy 8.04 and one with Karmic alpha 6
2009-09-30T00:44:00.000Z	ububuff		The one with Karmic offers me an Israeli download server
2009-09-30T00:44:00.000Z	ububuff		while the Hardy one doesn't
2009-09-30T00:45:00.000Z	ububuff		how do I fix that/
2009-09-30T00:46:00.000Z	DasEi	ububuff	synaptic
2009-09-30T00:48:00.000Z	ububuff	DasEi	Thanks for the quick answer, but I don't really follow how synaptic will help? Is there a package to add for the Israeli server?
2009-09-30T00:49:00.000Z	DasEi	ububuff	nope, but you can choose which server to use or use find fastest mirror plugin
2009-09-30T00:50:00.000Z	ububuff	DasEi	That's exactly the problem. On my Hardy machine, there is no Israeli server to choose from (either by manually choosing or asking to choose the best download server)
2009-09-30T00:51:00.000Z	DasEi	ububuff	maybe there is no in israel then, I'll start a vm to see myself , second
2009-09-30T00:51:00.000Z	ububuff	DasEi	I wouldn't even mind editing a sources file, but I couldn't find which file to edit. Thanks for checking this for me! :-)
2009-09-30T00:52:00.000Z	DasEi	ububuff	second, weak hardware here
2009-09-30T00:53:00.000Z	ububuff	DasEi	Just to let you know, the Israeli server appears on my karmic machine as il.archive.ubuntu.com (and as far as I remember I had this server ever since I installed this machine with Hardy)
2009-09-30T00:54:00.000Z	DasEi	ububuff	put that url in a browser (ftp..) and cycle through it to see if hardy is there
2009-09-30T00:56:00.000Z	ububuff	DasEi	It's an http server, yes and hardy (as well as hardy-backports, hardy-updates, hardy-secuity etc) appears
2009-09-30T01:00:00.000Z	DasEi	ububuff	so you got your solution, take the one from karmic , append it to the hardy one and then change, you're right, apt misses it it you could file a bug
2009-09-30T01:03:00.000Z	ububuff	DasEi	I apologize, but I don't quite follow. I already tried editing my sources.list file on my Hardy machine with the israeli mirror, but it doesn't help... When I call update-manager it still calls archive.ubuntu.com
2009-09-30T01:04:00.000Z	DasEi	ububuff	on both machines : sudo apt-get install pastebinit
2009-09-30T01:05:00.000Z	DasEi	ububuff	on both machines : pastebinit /etc/apt/sources.list  , give both urls here
2009-09-30T01:06:00.000Z	ububuff	DasEi	Thanks for the help, but unfortunately at home I work with my Karmic machine and the Hardy machine is at my mom's house so I can't do that right now...I will try again another time. Sorry for taking up your time then
