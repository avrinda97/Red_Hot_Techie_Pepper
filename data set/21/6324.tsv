2007-04-21T05:42:00.000Z	Huffalump	brandon^	are you a new user without any previous experience?
2007-04-21T05:43:00.000Z	Huffalump	brandon^	do you want a home desktop?  a server?  laptop?  do you have reasonable new hardware or an older machine?
2007-04-21T05:44:00.000Z	Huffalump	brandon^	I run AMD64 and there are small annoyances as mentioned, but I do not find it a major problem.
2007-04-21T05:46:00.000Z	Huffalump	brandon^	basically, what happens for Flash & Java... is you end up installing FireFox twice  (default install is Fx64 and that's already there.... you add the second Fx32 which you can then use Flash and Java with).  Follow me?  Small annoyance but easily worked around.
2007-04-21T05:47:00.000Z	Huffalump	brandon^	I don't disagree with jrib.  It is correct that if you want the easiest environment, go with 32 because you won't have the few extra hassles.  But if you've got any interest in getting your fingers dirty then 64 isn't too tough.
2007-04-21T05:48:00.000Z	brandon^	Huffalump	Im a CS major, just never dealt with linux, i can probably figure it out?
2007-04-21T05:48:00.000Z	Huffalump	brandon^	like Savage?  or Warcraft?  Thos work... what other games?  There's a bunch of old-school games, too, if you're down with that.
2007-04-21T05:49:00.000Z	Huffalump	brandon^	Ah, then you'll probably like the 64 bit.  Look, it works great!  There's just a few annoyances (Flash player, Java) that have known and well-working work arounds.   I say: get into it!
2007-04-21T05:50:00.000Z	Huffalump	brandon^	Here's a round-up of games (old, new, good, crud) -> http://happypenguin.org/
2007-04-21T05:52:00.000Z	Huffalump	brandon^	I believe that depends on the driver you install for your video, but there *is* some support for Quad SLI.  I am not an expert, but it does exist.
