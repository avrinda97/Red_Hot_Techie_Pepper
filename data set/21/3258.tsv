2009-04-07T23:26:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian		how do i configure ubuntu to use the updates mirror located at my college ?
2009-04-07T23:28:00.000Z	usr13	spaceBARbarian	Open System -> Administration -> Update Manager
2009-04-07T23:28:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	usr13	i looked at that but my school's mirror is not listed and it won't let me define one
2009-04-07T23:29:00.000Z	usr13	spaceBARbarian	To add additional repositories, click the "Add" button, and enter the location of the repository in the window
2009-04-07T23:30:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	usr13	do i add deb http://carroll.aset.psu.edu/pub/linux/distributions/ubuntu/dists/jaunty-updates/
2009-04-07T23:30:00.000Z	usr13	spaceBARbarian	Yes, if that is correct path.
2009-04-07T23:32:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	usr13	i added that location but how do i select it under the ubuntu software tab ?
2009-04-07T23:32:00.000Z	usr13	spaceBARbarian	deb http://xxx.xxxx/xxx/xx.xx hardy main
2009-04-07T23:33:00.000Z	usr13	spaceBARbarian	Sorry.... but a little more to it.
2009-04-07T23:33:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	usr13	right so how do i select it as my updates server ?
2009-04-07T23:35:00.000Z	usr13	spaceBARbarian	They will probably show up under the Third-Party Software Tab
2009-04-07T23:36:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	usr13	right it shows up there, and i selected it, does that mean it will be also used for updates now ?
2009-04-07T23:37:00.000Z	usr13	spaceBARbarian	I don't know.  I suppose it will if you un-slect the other.
2009-04-07T23:39:00.000Z	usr13	spaceBARbarian	probably should have been: deb http://xxx.xxxx/xxx/xx.xx hardy-security main
2009-04-07T23:40:00.000Z	usr13	spaceBARbarian	And you may need to do   apt-get update   afterward.
2009-04-10T00:58:00.000Z	usr13	spaceBARbarian	FAT32
2009-04-10T00:58:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	usr13	why so, why doesnt ntfs work ?
2009-04-10T00:59:00.000Z	usr13	spaceBARbarian	Sure, NTFS works too
2009-04-10T00:59:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	usr13	but like i said i get hose weird corrupt directory errors whenever i copy files from ubuntu to my ntfs drive
2009-04-10T01:00:00.000Z	usr13	spaceBARbarian	You asked "whats the best", I told you.
2009-04-10T01:02:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	usr13	i think ill just use dropbox with a symbolic link instead
