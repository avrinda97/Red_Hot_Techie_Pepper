2011-12-24T13:25:00.000Z	lyrae		its 'terrible' from different point of view
2011-12-24T13:25:00.000Z	lyrae		coders and developers, for instance
2011-12-24T13:25:00.000Z	lyrae		and newer is not always better :)
2011-12-24T13:26:00.000Z	lyrae		Anyways, i believe theres a bug with the gnome terminal, as i just formatted and bug still persists. could anyone verify?
2011-12-24T13:26:00.000Z	lyrae		i edit the profile to have menu bar off new windows, but menu bar always persists
2011-12-24T13:27:00.000Z	lyrae		i dont either, but not by choice
2011-12-24T13:28:00.000Z	lyrae		and it takes me longer to get to places
2011-12-24T13:28:00.000Z	meskarune	lyrae	tab complete. :)
2011-12-24T13:28:00.000Z	lyrae	meskarune	pfft
2011-12-24T13:38:00.000Z	meskarune	lyrae	there is. install the server edition of ubuntu
2011-12-24T13:38:00.000Z	lyrae	meskarune	even that comes with apache, php, etc, no?
2011-12-24T13:43:00.000Z	lyrae	meskarune	but isnt that the philosophy of linux? lots of small programs that do one thing well. cp , rm, cat, ls,
2011-12-24T13:45:00.000Z	meskarune	lyrae	its the unix philosophy. Linux is a unix clone. but ubuntu does not follow that philosophy. they have a different one. (which is neither better or worse)
2011-12-24T13:47:00.000Z	meskarune	lyrae	ubuntu's philosophy is to be as  human friendly as possible.
2011-12-24T13:48:00.000Z	meskarune	lyrae	yeah. :)
2011-12-24T13:50:00.000Z	meskarune	lyrae	I'm partial to arch linux. its my favorite distro
2011-12-24T13:51:00.000Z	lyrae	meskarune	why is that?
2011-12-24T13:52:00.000Z	meskarune	lyrae	its rolling release, so its always up to date. its super easy to compile programs. Its not buggy. You system only has the programs you want on it. The community is awesome, etc
2011-12-24T13:52:00.000Z	lyrae	meskarune	what about the packet manager?
2011-12-24T13:52:00.000Z	meskarune	lyrae	they use pacman. Its command line, but I like it better than other package manager i've ever used
2011-12-24T13:53:00.000Z	lyrae	meskarune	is it ok to PM you to ask some questions before i try?
