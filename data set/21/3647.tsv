2008-11-04T23:40:00.000Z	Tronn		How do I verify which video driver is in use in X ?
2008-11-04T23:40:00.000Z	`TonY	Tronn	do you have two  ?
2008-11-04T23:40:00.000Z	Tronn	`TonY	Only have the one... but 8.10 thought it was an ATI when I upgraded from 8.04
2008-11-04T23:41:00.000Z	`TonY	Tronn	lspci | grep VGA
2008-11-04T23:41:00.000Z	Tronn	`TonY	I have an Intel 965 -- can't get Visual Effects working
2008-11-04T23:42:00.000Z	Tronn	`TonY	I know what card I have -- just don't know what driver X is using...
2008-11-04T23:42:00.000Z	`TonY	Tronn	i know you know, but i need to know what your systems knows about what you know :P
2008-11-04T23:43:00.000Z	Tronn	`TonY	LOL - "Intel Corporation Mobile GM965" <-- short form of what came out
2008-11-04T23:43:00.000Z	`TonY	Tronn	then your system knows it is intel, why do you say it tells you that it is an ati ?
2008-11-04T23:44:00.000Z	Tronn	`TonY	I had installed EnvyNG to see what it would pick up -- picked up ATI as being installed. My real objective is to get Visual Effects back on (they were working fine with 8.04)
2008-11-04T23:45:00.000Z	`TonY	Tronn	sis you try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg-video-intel ?
2008-11-04T23:46:00.000Z	Tronn	`TonY	I didn't try that -- can I do that from within X?
2008-11-04T23:46:00.000Z	`TonY	Tronn	yes but you have to restart x (/etc/init.d/gdm restart) to take effects
2008-11-04T23:47:00.000Z	Tronn	`TonY	Thanks -- will give that a shot :)
2008-11-04T23:47:00.000Z	`TonY	Tronn	hope it helps
2008-11-05T00:35:00.000Z	Tronn	`TonY	tried "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg-video-intel" -- rebooted -- still no Visual Effects in 8.10 for the Intel 965 card.
2008-11-05T00:35:00.000Z	`TonY	Tronn	have you tried to enable it ? system -> preferences -> appearance ?
2008-11-05T00:36:00.000Z	`TonY	Tronn	what is the error of compiz --replace in terminal ?
2008-11-05T00:38:00.000Z	`TonY	Tronn	either private or paste.ubuntu.com
2008-11-05T00:40:00.000Z	`TonY	Tronn	hardy or 8.10 ?
2008-11-05T00:43:00.000Z	`TonY	Tronn	pm me please
