2011-08-04T16:04:00.000Z	dinesh_		canon MF4320d
2011-08-04T16:04:00.000Z	dinesh_		i have the printer driver.. it is in RPM
2011-08-04T16:04:00.000Z	usr13	dinesh_	What file did you download?
2011-08-04T16:05:00.000Z	usr13	dinesh_	There wasn't a deb ?
2011-08-04T16:07:00.000Z	usr13	dinesh_	Did you see a tar.gz version of the driver?
2011-08-04T16:07:00.000Z	usr13	dinesh_	Can you provide download link?
2011-08-04T16:08:00.000Z	usr13	dinesh_	I suppose you could try converting the rpm to deb
2011-08-04T16:09:00.000Z	usr13	dinesh_	With alien.   You may have to install it.  sudo apt-get install alien
2011-08-04T16:10:00.000Z	usr13	dinesh_	and I think you have to use sudo to use it.
2011-08-04T16:12:00.000Z	usr13	dinesh_	But as bazhang suggests, look on the manufactures website first and see what else you can find.
2011-08-04T16:15:00.000Z	usr13	dinesh_	Did you try configuring it first?
2011-08-04T16:16:00.000Z	usr13	dinesh_	If you have exausted other possibilities and are sure you have the correct driver, you can try converting it with alien
2011-08-04T16:18:00.000Z	usr13	dinesh_	sudo alien --to-deb file-name.rpm
2011-08-04T16:19:00.000Z	usr13	dinesh_	As bazhang suggests, you should check the website and any other possibilities for the .deb file because it is highly unlikely they wouldn't have it.
