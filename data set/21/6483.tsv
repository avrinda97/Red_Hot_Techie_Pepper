2007-03-24T16:21:00.000Z	RoundyT1		i need some FREENX help
2007-03-24T16:22:00.000Z	RoundyT1		it keeps saying "Session Startup Failed"
2007-03-24T16:23:00.000Z	Xenguy	RoundyT1	freenx can be finicky, for sure...
2007-03-24T16:23:00.000Z	RoundyT1	Xenguy	i
2007-03-24T16:23:00.000Z	Xenguy	RoundyT1	I spent lots of time getting it going some time ago
2007-03-24T16:23:00.000Z	RoundyT1	Xenguy	i'm using it over the LAN trying to access my server...?
2007-03-24T16:23:00.000Z	Xenguy	RoundyT1	rocks when it works tho
2007-03-24T16:23:00.000Z	RoundyT1	Xenguy	is that how im supposed to use it?
2007-03-24T16:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	RoundyT1	all I can suggest is that you google the error messages - I spent a lot of time doing that
2007-03-24T16:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	RoundyT1	sure, you can use it on a LAN, or over the Net
2007-03-24T16:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	RoundyT1	make sure that ssh authentication is not a problem
2007-03-24T16:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	RoundyT1	you may have to find and use an older version of the freenx client too
2007-03-24T16:26:00.000Z	Xenguy	RoundyT1	but if you google and read long enough you'll come across that issue too
2007-03-24T16:31:00.000Z	Xenguy	RoundyT1	I don't think so - you need X display
2007-03-24T16:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	RoundyT1	you need X (please prepend my nick if you are talking to me)
2007-03-24T16:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	RoundyT1	if you don't want X, then just use ssh
2007-03-24T16:33:00.000Z	RoundyT1	Xenguy	so can I use it to login via VPN to a Cisco Router?
2007-03-24T16:34:00.000Z	Xenguy	RoundyT1	more details required, but VPN and Cisco is going to quickly go over my head, and probably many others :-)
2007-03-24T16:34:00.000Z	Xenguy	RoundyT1	it is simple - it is a better VNC, for desktops, not servers
2007-03-24T16:36:00.000Z	Xenguy	RoundyT1	xpdf, evince, and there are other pdf viewers
2007-03-24T16:38:00.000Z	Xenguy	RoundyT1	don't repeat, or be ignored
