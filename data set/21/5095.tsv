2007-12-27T22:17:00.000Z	n3wUs3r		nothing at all
2007-12-27T22:17:00.000Z	RadiantFire	n3wUs3r	does the System Monitor show nautilus as running or not?
2007-12-27T22:17:00.000Z	n3wUs3r	RadiantFire	how do you get the system monitor?
2007-12-27T22:18:00.000Z	RadiantFire	n3wUs3r	system->admin->System Monitor
2007-12-27T22:18:00.000Z	n3wUs3r	RadiantFire	yes, it's running a lot
2007-12-27T22:18:00.000Z	n3wUs3r	RadiantFire	like 8 times
2007-12-27T22:19:00.000Z	n3wUs3r	RadiantFire	i pressed kill in the menu and it seems to have worked
2007-12-27T22:19:00.000Z	n3wUs3r	RadiantFire	nautilus appeared when i pressed kill...
2007-12-27T22:19:00.000Z	RadiantFire	n3wUs3r	the one thing I could say is delete all the nautilus config directories under .gconf, then when nautilus restarts its config will be restored to default
2007-12-27T22:19:00.000Z	RadiantFire	n3wUs3r	thats very destructive though
2007-12-27T22:20:00.000Z	n3wUs3r	RadiantFire	thanks, the menu seems to be working again now anyway and i can click on the desktop
2007-12-27T22:20:00.000Z	n3wUs3r		:D
2007-12-27T22:20:00.000Z	n3wUs3r	RadiantFire	thank you very much, jarlod you too and the other guy
2007-12-27T22:20:00.000Z	RadiantFire	n3wUs3r	oh goodie :-) Nautilus is somewhat flaky sometimes, jsut needs to be given a kick in the pants
