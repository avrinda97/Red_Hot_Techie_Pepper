2009-11-19T08:48:00.000Z	Ashfire908	digitalfiz	one sec
2009-11-19T08:49:00.000Z	Ashfire908	digitalfiz	how are you useing ssh at the moment?
2009-11-19T08:50:00.000Z	digitalfiz	Ashfire908	yes i can ssh using a id_rsa just cant find the options in sshfs to do so
2009-11-19T08:50:00.000Z	digitalfiz	Ashfire908	 for ssh its -i id_rsa_file but sshfs doesnt seem to have that option
2009-11-19T08:50:00.000Z	Ashfire908	digitalfiz	i don't think you need to tell it to use a key...
2009-11-19T08:51:00.000Z	Ashfire908	digitalfiz	when i use a key it's transparent...
2009-11-19T08:52:00.000Z	Ashfire908	digitalfiz	whatever you want to call it...
2009-11-19T08:52:00.000Z	Ashfire908	digitalfiz	is the id_rsa file in your ~/.ssh directory?
2009-11-19T08:52:00.000Z	digitalfiz	Ashfire908	if it helps im on an amazon ec2 install of ubuntu
2009-11-19T08:53:00.000Z	Ashfire908	digitalfiz	is the id_rsa file in your ~/.ssh directory?
2009-11-19T08:53:00.000Z	digitalfiz	Ashfire908	yes
2009-11-19T08:54:00.000Z	Ashfire908	digitalfiz	and sshfs doesn't autouse the key/whatever?
2009-11-19T08:56:00.000Z	Ashfire908	digitalfiz	that's normal.
2009-11-19T08:56:00.000Z	digitalfiz	Ashfire908	but now i get: read: Connection reset by peer
2009-11-19T08:57:00.000Z	Ashfire908	digitalfiz	I'm totally clueless towards that.
2009-11-19T08:57:00.000Z	digitalfiz	Ashfire908	 well i wanted to specify the id_rsa because i have different id_rsa's depending on the host
2009-11-19T08:58:00.000Z	Ashfire908	digitalfiz	ah.
