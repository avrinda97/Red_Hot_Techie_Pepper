2012-01-05T02:41:00.000Z	AnonMasochist		I am an IT Technician, I HATE Mac and Windows, 'cos they suck and are un-ethical, immoral, and now I hate Linux, AAAARRGH!!!!
2012-01-05T02:41:00.000Z	AnonMasochist		yes
2012-01-05T02:43:00.000Z	AnonMasochist		this is a problem with the Ubuntu OS itself!]
2012-01-05T02:45:00.000Z	AnonMasochist		Google 'Ubuntu 10.04 Freezing Problem', look at the forums, then give me a solution, 'cos at the moment, all I'm hearing is diagnostics that are ridiculously obvious, that I have of-course tried myself!
2012-01-05T02:46:00.000Z	AlanBell	AnonMasochist	have you tried 11.10?
2012-01-05T02:47:00.000Z	AlanBell	AnonMasochist	actually no, that was a bit broken for the VGA port on laptops up to a few weeks ago unless you were running a kernel from a PPA
2012-01-05T02:49:00.000Z	AlanBell	AnonMasochist	have you tried booting from a liveCD and choosing the memtest86 option and leaving it running overnight?
2012-01-05T02:49:00.000Z	AnonMasochist	AlanBell	yes, of-couse, tested okay.
2012-01-05T02:50:00.000Z	AlanBell	AnonMasochist	yeah, but it might provide interesting and useful information if you discover that say 11.10 works on a liveCD
2012-01-05T02:52:00.000Z	AlanBell	AnonMasochist	yes, we know
2012-01-05T02:53:00.000Z	AlanBell	AnonMasochist	you need to provide actionable information that people can use to help you
2012-01-05T02:54:00.000Z	AlanBell	AnonMasochist	does it still respond on the network after the display freezes? can you still ping it or ssh to it?
2012-01-05T02:54:00.000Z	AlanBell	AnonMasochist	could it be an overheating problem? clean the fans?
2012-01-05T02:55:00.000Z	AnonMasochist	AlanBell	I'm not a network admin, I am an IT Techie, no overheating, hardware is all okay, I can assure you of that.
2012-01-05T02:55:00.000Z	AlanBell	AnonMasochist	not asking for any advanced network stuff, just can you ping it?
2012-01-05T03:01:00.000Z	AlanBell	AnonMasochist	on another computer on your network (you are an IT tech so I presume you can find one to use even temporarily) ping the IP address of your ubuntu machine (doesn't matter if the thing pinging is windows mac or linux)
2012-01-05T03:06:00.000Z	AnonMasochist	AlanBell	look, I am talking to you right now with this machine, so that gives you a few clues.
2012-01-05T03:08:00.000Z	AnonMasochist	AlanBell	the freezing is usually triggered during the use of certain programs, I have identified Firefox,  Mixxx, and the game Warsow are the main triggers for the freeze, especially Warsow game.
2012-01-05T03:08:00.000Z	AlanBell	AnonMasochist	ok, in that case, it is hitting bad ram, or it is overheating.
2012-01-05T03:11:00.000Z	AnonMasochist	AlanBell	if you're so sure it's a hardware problem, of which I can confirm it is not, tell me what BASH commands you want the output of and I'll type them.
2012-01-05T03:13:00.000Z	AlanBell	AnonMasochist	the way to test memory is boot a live CD and choose the memtest86 option from the menu before it boots, and leave it running for lots of hours
