2007-07-25T11:55:00.000Z	Suicidolt		I've got ndiswrapper installed, with its awesome graphical interface, but I cannot find the right driver to install.  I picked it up from sourceforge like the wifi link told me too, but the driver it's showing is "bcmwl4a.inf" which is not in the zip file that was linked.  The zip file contains 9x drivers and NT drivers, which do I use if not the one that is listed? or where do I get the one...
2007-07-25T11:55:00.000Z	Suicidolt		...listed?
2007-07-25T11:56:00.000Z	Suicidolt		anyone?
2007-07-25T11:57:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	Suicidolt	try the NT driver
2007-07-25T12:09:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	Suicidolt	remember to add bcm43xx to /etc/modules
2007-07-25T12:09:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	Suicidolt	so it loads at bootup
2007-07-25T12:10:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	Suicidolt	if you add bcm43xx to the /etc/modules list it will load the module at startup so you can use the driver every time you boot without having to type "sudo modprobe bcm43xx" everytime you want to use your card
2007-07-25T12:11:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	Suicidolt	best way is to run this command "sudo echo "bcm43xx" >> /etc/modules
2007-07-25T12:24:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	Suicidolt	it's network-manager
2007-07-25T12:25:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	Suicidolt	you probably have to install it
2007-07-25T12:26:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	Suicidolt	run sudo aptitude install network-manager
2007-07-25T12:26:00.000Z	Suicidolt	CompIsMyRx	I have no internet, will that still work?
2007-07-25T12:38:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	Suicidolt	hmm, it might not be on the disk
2007-07-25T12:39:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	Suicidolt	you could download it manually and add to that machine from the one you're on now
2007-07-25T12:43:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	Suicidolt	dapper has network-manager and network-manager-gnome I believe, checking now though'
2007-07-25T12:44:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	Suicidolt	wireless support is much, MUCH better on feisty
2007-07-25T12:45:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	Suicidolt	the install is much cleaned up on feisty
2007-07-25T12:49:00.000Z	Suicidolt	CompIsMyRx	ubuntu.com lists mirrors, but not builds, are all of them feisty?
2007-07-25T12:50:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	Suicidolt	are you on this page? http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
2007-07-25T12:52:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	Suicidolt	unless you pick otherwise, they are all fiesty
