2005-12-13T09:17:00.000Z	raimian		iv typed it in what do i do now??
2005-12-13T09:18:00.000Z	raimian		it says unknown host
2005-12-13T09:18:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	try "ping -c 5 216.239.39.104"
2005-12-13T09:19:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	so your DNS is not working. your internet connection is fine
2005-12-13T09:20:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	sudo network-admin. click on the DNS tab and put in the DNS to your isp
2005-12-13T09:23:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	either in DNS tab in network-admin or /etc/resolv.conf
2005-12-13T09:23:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	if you edit resolv.conf by hand you add a dns server like this one "nameserver 212.27.54.252"
2005-12-13T09:27:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	can you ping the dns servers you have? if not, then your isp dns servers are down at the moment.
2005-12-13T09:29:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	well, you're not using dns to chat. can you ping them or not?
2005-12-13T09:29:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	"ping -c 5 dnsaddress.2.3.4"
2005-12-13T09:30:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	my dns is 212.27.54.252 so i would type "ping -c 5 212.27.54.252"
2005-12-13T09:31:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	you need to find out. should be in the papers from your isp.
2005-12-13T09:32:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	then all you can do is call them and ask.
2005-12-13T09:41:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	yep, in the dns tab
2005-12-13T09:43:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	give me one of the dns numbers
2005-12-13T09:44:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	looks as if it is active. wierd. can you ping it (i can't)?
2005-12-13T09:45:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	ah, the 213.249.130.100 works!
2005-12-13T09:46:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	ping -c 5 213.249.130.100
2005-12-13T09:47:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	add 213.249.130.100 into the DNS tab
2005-12-13T09:47:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	you can't? i could.
2005-12-13T09:48:00.000Z	Jowi	raimian	you have something seriously wrong somewhere. restart that box and try again. that last dns you gave me works fine.
