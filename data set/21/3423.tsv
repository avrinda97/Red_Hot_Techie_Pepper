2009-01-05T12:47:00.000Z	nickrud	jinja-sheep	were you looking for a working clone?
2009-01-05T12:48:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	nickrud	 I'm trying to install Ubuntu using Minimal Disk.  However, the laptop do not have any disc reader therefore I'm trying to do this by USB.
2009-01-05T12:49:00.000Z	nickrud	jinja-sheep	a well I can't help with that :) but   dpkg --get-selections >mypackages , move mypackages, dpkg --set-selections && apt-get dselect upgrade to clone the packages afterwards ;)
2009-01-05T12:50:00.000Z	nickrud	jinja-sheep	erm, dpkg --set-selections < mypackages that is
2009-01-05T12:50:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	nickrud	 Oh I don't want to clone the packages.   Default Ubuntu came with several packages that I don't want. >_>
2009-01-05T12:50:00.000Z	nickrud	jinja-sheep	heresy.
2009-01-06T10:33:00.000Z	nickrud	jinja-sheep	that' wouldn't be a bot you're talking to would it
2009-01-06T10:34:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	nickrud	 Hmm.  No.  I'm trying to figure out if XChat have the ability to display all messages that are particularly for me on the separate tab rather than in this channel or any other channel.
2009-01-06T10:47:00.000Z	nickrud	jinja-sheep	please do that in another channel, maybe create one of your own
2009-01-06T10:47:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	nickrud	 I'm not flooding.  This is something I say occasionally.  I'm done with the setup tho. ;)
2009-01-06T10:48:00.000Z	nickrud	jinja-sheep	glad you're done, but I do class it as offtopic :)
2009-01-11T11:16:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	nickrud	 I learned something about WINE. ;)  http://ardchoille.nfshost.com/Linux/WineRunsWindowsViruses
2009-01-15T11:18:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	nickrud	 I learned something new. ;)
2009-01-15T11:21:00.000Z	nickrud	jinja-sheep	try alt- other buttons as well, both are useful
2009-01-15T11:25:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	nickrud	 What's it I'm looking for -- to replace the boot screen -- ?  uplash ?
2009-01-15T11:25:00.000Z	nickrud	jinja-sheep	usplash for the moving bar with ubuntu text above
2009-01-15T11:28:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	nickrud	 How do I configure usplash?  According to the aptitude, it's already installed (usplash + usplash-theme-ubuntu).  I don't see anything in System.  Might be hidden tho.
2009-01-15T11:30:00.000Z	nickrud	jinja-sheep	you can use startupmanager, or   sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so
2009-01-15T11:30:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	nickrud	 ^^ Up there. ;)
2009-01-15T11:30:00.000Z	nickrud	jinja-sheep	yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't ask questions you can find the answers to yourself :P
