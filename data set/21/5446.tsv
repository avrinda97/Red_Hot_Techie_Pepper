2008-02-19T08:26:00.000Z	edwin	Creationist	what kind of card do you have again?
2008-02-19T08:27:00.000Z	Creationist	edwin	He has a Broadcom BCM4318 AirForce One 54g
2008-02-19T08:27:00.000Z	edwin	Creationist	oh god... i'll sit this one out :-\
2008-02-19T08:27:00.000Z	Creationist	edwin	lol yeah, that's what I've read
2008-02-19T08:32:00.000Z	Creationist	edwin	Yeah... hence the reason I removed it from his Windows install. :P
2008-02-19T08:32:00.000Z	edwin	Creationist	lmao
2008-02-19T08:33:00.000Z	Creationist	edwin	Upon doing so, though, it notified me that uninstalling may cause him to lose his remaining 303 days of subscription.  What the crap kind of business is that??
2008-02-19T08:34:00.000Z	edwin	Creationist	thats crap, what if he just wanted to move the software to a different machine (i mean, i'm sure that loading it on dual machines is forbidden, similar to the windows liscence)?
2008-02-19T08:34:00.000Z	edwin	Creationist	 +1 for open source
2008-02-19T08:34:00.000Z	Creationist	edwin	Yeah, I was appalled to read that when uninstalling.
2008-02-19T08:34:00.000Z	Creationist	edwin	But I hit continue anyway ;)
2008-02-19T08:34:00.000Z	edwin	Creationist	ha

2008-02-19T08:45:00.000Z	edwin	Creationist	you're like the troll anti-christ. you know, leading all the trolls into false salvation in reality cursin them into eternal damnation
2008-02-19T08:46:00.000Z	Creationist	edwin	Well, they've earned it :)
2008-02-19T08:46:00.000Z	Creationist	edwin	That's the only "salvation" a person CAN earn, actually... but that's an #off-topic topic ;)
2008-02-19T08:54:00.000Z	Creationist	edwin	Nothing like a man page for the manual, huh? ;)
2008-02-19T08:54:00.000Z	edwin	Creationist	i fell in love with man at first sight (not to sound gay)
