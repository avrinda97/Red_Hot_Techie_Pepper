2010-03-02T06:55:00.000Z	Yendor		Anyone able to help me figure out why I can't connect to my Airport Extreme-based wireless network on 9.10?
2010-03-02T06:56:00.000Z	TecnoBrat	Yendor	WEP or WPA?
2010-03-02T06:57:00.000Z	Yendor	TecnoBrat	Neither, just a plain old open network.
2010-03-02T06:57:00.000Z	TecnoBrat	Yendor	hmmm
2010-03-02T06:58:00.000Z	TecnoBrat	Yendor	worked in earlier version of ubuntu?
2010-03-02T06:58:00.000Z	Yendor	TecnoBrat	bcm4306 card, 5-year-old hp laptop, b43-fwcutter installed.
2010-03-02T06:59:00.000Z	Yendor	TecnoBrat	I've not used the laptop in a year and a half; It was in various states of working and not working prior to that for its entire life.
2010-03-02T06:59:00.000Z	TecnoBrat	Yendor	hmmm, odd ... network-manager?
2010-03-02T07:00:00.000Z	Yendor	TecnoBrat	Let me go retrieve the laptop from upstairs.  Sorry, left it up there.  Just a min.
2010-03-02T07:04:00.000Z	Yendor	TecnoBrat	OK, laptop retrieved.  It was upstairs because that's where the wired connection is.  But down here, I have wireless working (on this computer, not the laptop), so any notes will have to be hand-copied from the other screen
2010-03-02T07:04:00.000Z	Yendor	TecnoBrat	That aside.......What do you want/need to know?
2010-03-02T07:05:00.000Z	TecnoBrat	Yendor	what happens when you try to connect
2010-03-02T07:05:00.000Z	Yendor	TecnoBrat	ifdown wlan0; ifup wlan0
2010-03-02T07:07:00.000Z	TecnoBrat	Yendor	so you aren't using network-manager or wifi-radar?
2010-03-02T07:07:00.000Z	Yendor	TecnoBrat	Never heard of wifi-radar, and I believe I've tried network-manager to no avail.
2010-03-02T07:08:00.000Z	Yendor	TecnoBrat	Heh.  Remember that part about the network being upstairs?
2010-03-02T07:11:00.000Z	Yendor	TecnoBrat	Any command-line incantations you're aware of that might help?
2010-03-02T07:11:00.000Z	Yendor	TecnoBrat	I'm 100% comfortable at the CLI
2010-03-02T07:16:00.000Z	Yendor	TecnoBrat	No ideas about CLI incantations?  No network connection means no downloading wifi-radar
2010-03-02T07:20:00.000Z	TecnoBrat	Yendor	I've gotta run out .. but I'd suggest going through this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WiFiHowTo
2010-03-02T07:21:00.000Z	Yendor	TecnoBrat	Thanks.  I'll peruse it
