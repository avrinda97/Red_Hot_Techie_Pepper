2008-03-21T09:33:00.000Z	foo		scp "tasha:/public/listen/music3/Saliva/Unknown Album/Click Click Boom.mp3"  ./ says this: cp: /public/listen/music3/Saliva/Unknown: No such file or directory
2008-03-21T09:33:00.000Z	foo		scp: Album/Click: No such file or directory
2008-03-21T09:33:00.000Z	foo		I used quotes, backslashes, single quotes, quotes around directory name only ... and I keep getting that error, any ideas?
2008-03-21T09:34:00.000Z	nikrud	foo	scp user@host:/path/to/file
2008-03-21T09:34:00.000Z	foo	nikrud	tasha is configured in .config for ssh
2008-03-21T09:35:00.000Z	nikrud	foo	hm, then doh. try /Unknown\ Album , didn't that work?
2008-03-21T09:35:00.000Z	foo	nikrud	that's what I'm asking :) makes no sense to me
2008-03-21T09:36:00.000Z	nikrud	foo	I've seen people use \ instead of space, but if you've set up .config I guess my simplistic answers won't do ;(
2008-03-21T09:36:00.000Z	foo	nikrud	thanks :/ weird
2008-03-21T09:37:00.000Z	nikrud	foo	have you tried the user@host syntax, just for kicks?
2008-03-21T09:37:00.000Z	foo	nikrud	no go
2008-03-21T09:38:00.000Z	nikrud	foo	then you've done what I would try. except maybe for tasha:" etc " unless you've tried that
2008-03-21T09:38:00.000Z	foo	nikrud	yuo, I have
2008-03-21T09:39:00.000Z	nikrud	foo	that is why I never use spaces in file paths, it always seems to trip me up somewhere
2008-03-21T09:39:00.000Z	foo	nikrud	yeah, but this is elementary, it should be working
2008-03-21T09:42:00.000Z	foo	nikrud	FYI, I needed quotes and double backslashes
2008-03-21T09:43:00.000Z	nikrud	foo	like " .... wierd\\ name ..."
2008-03-21T09:47:00.000Z	foo	nikrud	yup
2008-03-21T09:47:00.000Z	nikrud	foo	thanks, knowing that will someday save me some hair
2008-03-21T09:47:00.000Z	foo	nikrud	:)
2008-03-21T09:47:00.000Z	foo	nikrud	apparently it gets escaped by my shell and the remote shell
