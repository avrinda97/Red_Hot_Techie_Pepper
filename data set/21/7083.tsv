2007-01-01T17:05:00.000Z	bruenig	con-man	run winecfg
2007-01-01T17:08:00.000Z	bruenig	con-man	what happens when you do, winecfg in the terminal
2007-01-01T17:09:00.000Z	con-man	bruenig	winecfg loads the wine options window
2007-01-01T17:09:00.000Z	bruenig	con-man	ok, then it should all be good, wine whatever.exe, what does that do
2007-01-01T17:10:00.000Z	con-man	bruenig	bash: /usr/bin/wine: No such file or directory
2007-01-01T17:10:00.000Z	bruenig	con-man	is /usr/local/bin not in your PATH?
2007-01-01T17:11:00.000Z	con-man	bruenig	bash: /usr/bin/wine: No such file or directory
2007-01-01T17:11:00.000Z	bruenig	con-man	well try this, /usr/local/bin/wine whatever.exe
2007-01-01T17:12:00.000Z	bruenig	con-man	I don't understand why you compiled it, there is a bleeding edge wine repo
2007-01-01T17:12:00.000Z	con-man	bruenig	works
2007-01-01T17:12:00.000Z	bruenig	con-man	well just do that from now on then
2007-01-01T17:12:00.000Z	con-man	bruenig	can I fix it though?
2007-01-01T17:12:00.000Z	bruenig	con-man	if open up /etc/environment, make sure that in the PATH you have /usr/local/bin
2008-04-14T06:39:00.000Z	bruenig	con-man	it has always been on discrete release.
