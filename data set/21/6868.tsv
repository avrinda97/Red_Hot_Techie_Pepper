2007-01-14T09:33:00.000Z	mcsetty		Hey I have an issue I have been trying to resolve for a while now and have done some searching but I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for, can anyone help me out?
2007-01-14T09:33:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	how do we know?
2007-01-14T09:33:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	you need to ask the question! ;)
2007-01-14T09:34:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	what exactly did you do to "switch" ?
2007-01-14T09:36:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	np
2007-01-14T09:39:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	it's /etc/init.d/gdm start
2007-01-14T09:39:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	it'll start the login manager
2007-01-14T09:39:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	then you login
2007-01-14T09:40:00.000Z	mcsetty	gma	thanks again ill let you know if that works
2007-01-14T09:43:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	I doubt it, but who knows
2007-01-14T09:43:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	did you run it with sudo ?
2007-01-14T09:43:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	yeah, it needs root privileges
2007-01-14T09:43:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	sorry
2007-01-14T09:47:00.000Z	mcsetty	gma	same error sayings gdm isn't my default desktop manager
2007-01-14T09:47:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	weird
2007-01-14T09:48:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	when I try it I get something quite different (it tries to start gdm)
2007-01-14T09:48:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	even if I run it as myself
2007-01-14T09:48:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	no, but that might not be anything to do with it
2007-01-14T10:18:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	when I did it there was a README file that said stick it in the /blah/blah/plugins directory
2007-01-14T10:18:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	so look for one that has 'plugins' on the end ofit
2007-01-14T10:20:00.000Z	gma	mcsetty	no probs
