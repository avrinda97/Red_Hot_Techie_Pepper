2009-06-21T12:57:00.000Z	bob_rock		if I choose 2.6.28-11 there would be no problem but when I choose 2.6.28-13, a problem appears in my NVidia driver which is not supported in kernel 2.6.28-13. I have reinstalling using NVIDIA-Linux-x86-96.43.11-pkg1.run from NVidia website but it tells the kernel is not supported
