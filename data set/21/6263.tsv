2007-09-15T16:24:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW		Blank: So then I went onto the docs, and went through the steps, tried the auto-detect first... then I went googling for my hori and vert for my monitor.
2007-09-15T16:25:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW		Blank, Bruenig: I understand how it works now. The lack of gui was really what made it tough. And hasseling with VI.
2007-09-15T16:25:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW		Blank: Yeah, only gave me the 640x480 option.
2007-09-15T16:26:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW		Blank: The odd thing is, it detected my monitor's refresh at 50 when it was supposed to be 75.
2007-09-15T16:26:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW		Blank: So I googled and found the proper vertrefresh and horisync... and then modified the xorg.conf, and made a backup in case it breaks.
2007-09-15T16:27:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW		Blank: Yeah. :) After hassling with it, I've gotten it working. I feel accomplished.
2007-09-15T16:28:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW		Now I need to figure out how to get my Plantroics DSP-500 working.
2007-09-15T16:28:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW		I kind of like having sound...
2007-09-15T16:30:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW		So... does anyone have suggestions about how to get my DSP-500 plantronics headset working?
2007-09-15T16:31:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW		I've done a little bit of googling, but most of it is inconclusive. Actually, that's how my config got messed up in the first place, trying to install the DSP-500.
2007-09-15T16:31:00.000Z	neverblue2	Ray_at_UW	what are you trying to get it run in?
2007-09-15T16:32:00.000Z	neverblue2	Ray_at_UW	works in windows is an insulting comment
2007-09-15T16:32:00.000Z	neverblue2	Ray_at_UW	if you would like assistance, I can help, I use those all day long
2007-09-15T16:36:00.000Z	neverblue2	Ray_at_UW	Xorg has nothing to do with your headset, hold on a minute, thanks
