2005-07-18T15:15:00.000Z	Sonderblade		when i use synaptic to install some packages it asks me to insert the ubuntu cd-rom but i want to download them from the internet
2005-07-18T15:15:00.000Z	bob2	Sonderblade	so, configure apt to not use the cd.  if you're using synaptic, use the repository manager thing to not use the cd
2005-07-18T15:16:00.000Z	bob2	Sonderblade	otherwise, comment it out in /etc/apt/sources.list

2005-07-18T15:25:00.000Z	Sonderblade	bob2	oh there i didn't see it first
2005-07-27T13:16:00.000Z	bob2	Sonderblade	you don't know what card you bought?
2005-07-27T13:16:00.000Z	Sonderblade	bob2	it is not my computer
2005-08-31T14:00:00.000Z	bob2	Sonderblade	/usr/share/doc/iptables/README.Debian
2005-08-31T14:01:00.000Z	Sonderblade	bob2	yes thats what i mean :) isn't iptables and firewall the same thing?
2005-08-31T14:03:00.000Z	bob2	Sonderblade	iptables is the core kernel part of linux's firewalling, but normally you don't use it directly
2005-08-31T14:03:00.000Z	Sonderblade	bob2	what do you use instead?
2005-08-31T14:05:00.000Z	bob2	Sonderblade	shorewall is a nice wrapper for it
2005-08-31T14:07:00.000Z	Sonderblade	bob2	thanks
2005-09-12T15:20:00.000Z	bob2	Sonderblade	why did you do that?
2005-09-12T15:21:00.000Z	bob2	Sonderblade	no, it doesn't have anything to do with that
2005-09-12T15:21:00.000Z	bob2	Sonderblade	removing everything you just installed is likely the simplest solution
2005-09-12T15:23:00.000Z	Sonderblade	bob2	now usb memories aren't autodetected, they were when hal worked
2005-09-12T15:23:00.000Z	bob2	Sonderblade	so, get rid of all that stuff you just installed
2005-09-12T15:24:00.000Z	Sonderblade	bob2	i know that, but i prefer to solve the problem
2005-09-12T15:24:00.000Z	bob2	Sonderblade	the solution is to get rid of all that crap
2005-09-12T15:24:00.000Z	bob2	Sonderblade	since you just installed some random cvs version that may or may not work
