2008-02-13T11:48:00.000Z	rich1		hi.  does anyone have ideas about how to get applets working in firefox?
2008-02-13T11:48:00.000Z	aswd	rich1	java applets?
2008-02-13T11:49:00.000Z	rich1	aswd	yes.  applets will not load in firefox.
2008-02-13T11:49:00.000Z	rich1	aswd	freechess.org's jin, skyviewcafe.com, the official us clock; none work.
2008-02-13T11:49:00.000Z	aswd	rich1	open any website with java applets. and select install missing plugins
2008-02-13T11:50:00.000Z	rich1	aswd	i have installed and reinstalled ad nauseam.  but no go.  there are all sorts of posts about this on the ubuntu forums.
2008-02-13T11:51:00.000Z	rich1	aswd	are you using firefox?
2008-02-13T11:51:00.000Z	aswd	rich1	yes
2008-02-13T11:52:00.000Z	rich1	aswd	try skyviewcafe.com.  it's an astronomy site.
2008-02-13T11:53:00.000Z	aswd	rich1	i have it working
2008-02-13T11:53:00.000Z	rich1	aswd	dang.  mine will not load.  what ff are you using?
2008-02-13T11:55:00.000Z	aswd	rich1	2.0.0.12
2008-02-13T11:56:00.000Z	rich1	aswd	ding dang.  do you have any ideas?  i'm at a loss.
2008-02-13T11:56:00.000Z	aswd	rich1	install missing plugins gives no options ?
2008-02-13T11:57:00.000Z	rich1	aswd	i have everything installed.  all applets load under opera, epiphany, konqueror but not ff.
2008-02-13T11:58:00.000Z	rich1	aswd	all my java is good.  it's got to be something in the ff config.

2008-02-13T11:59:00.000Z	rich1	aswd	ok.  thanks.
