2006-01-13T07:34:00.000Z	sjg		Got some serious issues with my x configuration, now when I first installed this machine with breezy it worked perfect. Although I dont know what I did to change it. What would be the easist way to go back to the original configuration of x? where it acutally worked? I really dont want to reinstall.?
2006-01-13T07:35:00.000Z	mwe	sjg	you can't if you didn't make a backup
2006-01-13T07:35:00.000Z	mwe	sjg	you'll have to reconfigure it
2006-01-13T07:35:00.000Z	mwe	sjg	back up what you have now and do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-01-13T07:36:00.000Z	sjg	mwe	Yep, definitely didnt back it up, dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg didnt work though.
2006-01-13T07:36:00.000Z	mwe	sjg	how didn't it work?
2006-01-13T07:36:00.000Z	sjg	mwe	well, I ran that tool, filled in the info it asks for and still no workie :P
2006-01-13T07:37:00.000Z	mwe	sjg	sure you filled in the correct info?
2006-01-13T07:37:00.000Z	mwe	sjg	can't you get in to X windows at all?
