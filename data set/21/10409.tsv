2005-07-15T05:47:00.000Z	djp	linuxboy	have you cleared the cache in firefox? just a suggestion
2005-07-15T05:48:00.000Z	linuxboy	djp	the cache lives in .mozilla.... i deleted it already
2005-07-15T05:48:00.000Z	djp	linuxboy	ahh, you deleted the entire folder got you. hmm strange... hold on...
2005-07-15T05:49:00.000Z	linuxboy	djp	it must be something else... I can't figure out what. I ever straced it
2005-07-15T05:51:00.000Z	linuxboy	djp	oh yes, let me show you the error...
