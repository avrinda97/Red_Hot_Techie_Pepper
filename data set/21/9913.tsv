2005-08-08T12:47:00.000Z	nickrud	anacron	boot in recovery mode, and change /etc/rc2.d/S13gdm to K13gdm, then reboot
2005-08-08T12:47:00.000Z	anacron	nickrud	with ubuntu install cd?
2005-08-08T12:48:00.000Z	nickrud	anacron	recovery should be in your grub menu
2005-08-08T12:48:00.000Z	anacron	nickrud	ok
2005-08-08T12:48:00.000Z	nickrud	anacron	you'll get a console, you can call nano to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf from there
2005-08-08T12:48:00.000Z	anacron	nickrud	great, thanks
2005-08-08T12:49:00.000Z	nickrud	anacron	when you're done, change gdm back to S13, then sudo invoke-rc.d gdm start will get you back to normal
2005-08-08T12:50:00.000Z	anacron	nickrud	can't i just edit the xorg.conf, do i have to do that as well?
2005-08-08T12:50:00.000Z	nickrud	anacron	the rc2.d stuff is adjusting running services
2005-08-08T12:51:00.000Z	anacron	nickrud	okay, so its impossible without doing some changes
2005-08-08T12:51:00.000Z	nickrud	anacron	yes, if you truly lock up during boot
2005-08-08T12:51:00.000Z	anacron	nickrud	well i have to write that down somewhere, im at work now, so i can test it right now :)
2005-08-13T12:43:00.000Z	nickrud	anacron	what does uname -a say?
2005-08-13T12:43:00.000Z	anacron	nickrud	im not in that machine right now
2005-08-13T12:44:00.000Z	nickrud	anacron	if uname -m says i686, you'll be ok
2005-08-13T12:44:00.000Z	anacron	nickrud	okay
2005-08-13T12:46:00.000Z	anacron	nickrud	that's just a keyboard layout?
2005-08-13T12:46:00.000Z	nickrud	anacron	no, that is not keyboard, that is display
2005-08-13T12:47:00.000Z	anacron	nickrud	yeah anyways that won't affect you time settings
2005-08-13T12:47:00.000Z	nickrud	anacron	sorry, then tzconfig is what you want
