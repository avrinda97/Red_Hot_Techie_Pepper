2006-11-11T16:50:00.000Z	ajax4	livingdaylight	You want it to default to German?
2006-11-11T16:50:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ajax4	i want to if i'm writing an email or document that needs to be in german that i can flip into german layout with umlauts etc
2006-11-11T16:51:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ajax4	no, primary is english, but occasionally i want to be able to use german letters
2006-11-11T16:51:00.000Z	ajax4	livingdaylight	in KDE only?
2006-11-11T16:52:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ajax4	I am in Ubuntu, what i said is that in Kubuntu (kde) it is very simple with the language/option dialog in the taskbar, but in Ubuntu (gnome) of course it is not so configurable
2006-11-11T16:53:00.000Z	livingdaylight		EVERYBODY ! DOES GNOME SUCK WHEN IT COMES TO CONFIGURABILITY?
2006-11-11T16:53:00.000Z	ajax4	livingdaylight	Have you tried the Gnome Character Palette?
2006-11-11T16:54:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ajax4	no, but what is the point of having a keyboard layout if it doens't work?
2006-11-11T16:54:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ajax4	where is this gnome character pallete?
2006-11-11T16:55:00.000Z	ajax4	livingdaylight	Right click any gnome panel and add the applet. Try "Character Pallete" and try "Keyboard Indictator"
2006-11-11T16:56:00.000Z	ajax4	livingdaylight	I think you might be able to change Keyboard Layout with the "Keyboard Indicator" applet, though only speaking one language I've never used it. :)
2006-11-11T16:56:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ajax4	gnome panel?
2006-11-11T16:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ajax4	 r me her , ja
2006-11-11T16:58:00.000Z	ajax4	livingdaylight	It worked?
2006-11-11T16:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ajax4	ajax4, 
2006-11-11T16:58:00.000Z	ajax4	livingdaylight	Good deal. See it was there all along, just need to know how to find it :)
2006-11-11T16:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ajax4	that was exactly what i was looking for
2006-11-11T16:59:00.000Z	ajax4	livingdaylight	Glad to help
2006-11-11T17:00:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ajax4	yea... i got frustrated because i went to system/preference and changed keyboard layout from there and it wasn't working. And how was i supposed to know about adding to the panel? so... but that is why people like you in the community on irc make ubuntu what it is
2006-11-11T17:01:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ajax4	even The Official Ubuntu Book didn't tell me i should add "keyboard" indicator to panel
