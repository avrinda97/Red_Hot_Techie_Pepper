2008-09-29T01:47:00.000Z	AnonymousOne		I've asked this question once before, and I am too lazy to type it again, so I have posted the question in a pastebin.. http://pastebin.com/d17c0937d .. for those interested, it has to do with networking
2008-09-29T01:49:00.000Z	pihhan	AnonymousOne	how is ethernet related to modem? it should work both at the same time
2008-09-29T02:05:00.000Z	pihhan	AnonymousOne	but i have no clue where you will find that information
2008-09-29T01:49:00.000Z	AnonymousOne	pihhan	does it have any relations to eth0 ?
2008-09-29T01:50:00.000Z	AnonymousOne	pihhan	the problem is that the computer is not assigning itself an IP
2008-09-29T01:50:00.000Z	pihhan	AnonymousOne	it does not assign ip from LAN, or from modem?
2008-09-29T01:50:00.000Z	AnonymousOne	pihhan	Windows Explorer has a feature that automatically prompts for a new IP address, but Ubuntu does not
2008-09-29T01:51:00.000Z	pihhan	AnonymousOne	does that modem work under linux?
2008-09-29T01:51:00.000Z	pihhan	AnonymousOne	AFAIK with modem, normal usage is to get automaticaly ip from provider, without configuring by hand

2008-09-29T01:54:00.000Z	pihhan	AnonymousOne	what technology is that modem of? normal modems does not have any MAC addresses AFAIK
2008-09-29T01:59:00.000Z	pihhan	AnonymousOne	ok, your modem does have ethernet cable to connect to computer? but does not give you address when you start computer?
2008-09-29T01:59:00.000Z	AnonymousOne	pihhan	correct
2008-09-29T02:01:00.000Z	AnonymousOne	pihhan	I believe it has something to do with the ISP, Comcast
2008-09-29T02:01:00.000Z	pihhan	AnonymousOne	i think i found solution
2008-09-29T02:02:00.000Z	AnonymousOne	pihhan	I wouldn't know where to find it
2008-09-29T02:02:00.000Z	pihhan	AnonymousOne	according to http://www.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/linux/comcast.html, you have to send dhcp name in dhcp query
2008-09-29T02:02:00.000Z	AnonymousOne	pihhan	where might I find the dhcp name?
2008-09-29T02:03:00.000Z	pihhan	AnonymousOne	i dont know, somewhere in documentation? maybe your username or such thing
2008-09-29T02:04:00.000Z	pihhan	AnonymousOne	you need edit propably /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf and change send host-name "<hostname>" to something your modem does expect
2008-09-29T02:05:00.000Z	AnonymousOne	pihhan	okay, thanks
