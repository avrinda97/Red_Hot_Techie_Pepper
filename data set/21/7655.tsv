2006-08-11T08:57:00.000Z	earthsound		is there a rule of thumb for partitioning sizes for /, /swap, /home, etc., in Ubuntu?
2006-08-11T08:58:00.000Z	el_isma	earthsound	I wouldn't recommend more than 300Mb for Swap
2006-08-11T08:59:00.000Z	el_isma	earthsound	a partition for /home is up to you, I don't have a partition for it, but some people like it best
2006-08-11T08:59:00.000Z	earthsound	el_isma	it's been a while since I've installed a linux distro...but for some reason I remember making the swap about twice the size of the RAM. is that no longer a valid measure?
2006-08-11T09:00:00.000Z	el_isma	earthsound	If you've got 64Mb RAM that's only 128Mb Swap... But if you have a gig ram, you *don't* need swap
2006-08-11T09:00:00.000Z	el_isma	earthsound	I actually run my pc without swap..
2006-08-11T09:00:00.000Z	earthsound	el_isma	that's good to know. this particular machine has 1GB RAM
2006-08-11T09:01:00.000Z	el_isma	earthsound	You can run quite a bit on 1 gig. I run KDE+Vmware(256Mb Ram) + Azureus (java) and still got 500mb free
2006-08-11T09:01:00.000Z	earthsound	el_isma	if I do some heavy image manipulation or video editing, I will need some swap space, though
2006-08-11T09:02:00.000Z	el_isma	earthsound	Maybe... But, as I said, too much swap will *kill* your perfomance
2006-08-11T09:02:00.000Z	el_isma	earthsound	remember that swap is "false ram"
2006-08-11T09:03:00.000Z	earthsound	el_isma	yes, but it won't be used unless the RAM isn't available, right?
2006-08-11T09:03:00.000Z	el_isma	earthsound	Depends on swappiness, but in general, it won't.
2006-08-11T09:05:00.000Z	earthsound	el_isma	sounds good. another question that I didn't see in the wiki: is there a problem w/ large SATA hd? (250GB)
2006-08-11T09:06:00.000Z	el_isma	earthsound	I don't know... It shouldn't be... I'm running a 160Gb SATA (boot from there, too)
2006-08-11T09:08:00.000Z	el_isma	earthsound	I'm using ntfs-3g. Works quite well. Supposedly it's beta software, so if you REALLY care about your files, you better not use it. But I been using it for a week or two now, It works great.
2006-08-11T09:08:00.000Z	el_isma	earthsound	Had to do a chkdsk on windows one time, but only for a silly error
2006-08-11T09:09:00.000Z	earthsound	el_isma	I can't remember what I was using a year ago (it, too, came with warnings :) ), but the shared NTFS partition will contain mostly media files (images, video, some text, etc.)
2006-08-11T09:09:00.000Z	el_isma	earthsound	ntfs-3g is quite new.
2006-08-11T09:09:00.000Z	el_isma	earthsound	allow read-write
2006-08-11T09:09:00.000Z	el_isma	earthsound	I can look up the deb. rep, if you want
