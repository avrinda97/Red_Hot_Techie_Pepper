2011-10-13T17:48:00.000Z	edgy		Hi, I booted oneiric kubuntu and I only have the splash, tty1 shows error like cannot mount /cdrom or similar message
2011-10-13T17:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	edgy	 you mean you are booting a live cd. you did check the md5 sum after downloading it?
2011-10-13T17:49:00.000Z	edgy	dr_willis	I booted a live usb
2011-10-13T17:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	edgy	 and you did check the md5sum of the iso file?
2011-10-13T17:49:00.000Z	edgy	dr_willis	i downloaded with zsync so I ams ure it's correct
2011-10-13T17:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	edgy	 this is the desktop or server  version?
2011-10-13T17:50:00.000Z	edgy	dr_willis	desktop
2011-10-13T17:51:00.000Z	edgy	dr_willis	i think in ubuntu there is a way to pass kernel args like noacpi but it's not clear how to even do this in kubuntu
2011-10-13T17:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	edgy	 same way - at the grub menus
2011-10-13T17:52:00.000Z	edgy	dr_willis	druing installation there is no grub menu
2011-10-13T17:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	edgy	 when it first boots up theres a man/keyboard logo.. hit space.. hit f5 or f6 i recall..
2011-10-13T17:53:00.000Z	edgy	dr_willis	sorry I was confused, when I boot the usb, it shows options like start kubuntu, test memory, boot from drive, you mean before this  step?
2011-10-13T17:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	edgy	 yes.
2011-10-13T17:55:00.000Z	edgy	dr_willis	I will go try it in the other room and come back ...
2011-10-13T18:02:00.000Z	edgy	dr_willis	you are right, f6 works though it should be mentioned somewhere! Anyway, I tried different options but still cannot boot, the error is exactly - umount: can't mount /cdrom
2011-12-05T22:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	edgy	 thats why we caution against using just any ppa
2011-12-05T22:05:00.000Z	edgy	dr_willis	and how can I know which one I can use safely?
2012-02-28T19:26:00.000Z	edgy	dr_willis	from the bios
2012-02-28T19:27:00.000Z	edgy	dr_willis	sacarlson: actually I tried to boot linux and just see a black screen then I tried some of the kernel options and got the installer but the disks appear as two 500G disks
2012-02-28T19:27:00.000Z	edgy	dr_willis	yes, two drives
2012-02-28T19:30:00.000Z	edgy	dr_willis	yes, and I don't care about raid 0 but I guess if I changed this now I have to reinstall windows, right?
