2010-02-11T18:22:00.000Z	root51		i accidentally inject the wrong source list
2010-02-11T18:22:00.000Z	ikonia	root51	use a text editor in /etc/apt/sources.list or use software sources editor from the menu
2010-02-11T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	root51	use the software source editor from system -> administration menu
2010-02-12T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	root51	there are graphics patches available, but I don't think they are included in grub2 built by uubntu by default
2010-02-12T15:42:00.000Z	ikonia	root51	yes, but do you REALLY want to start patching your grb package ?
2010-02-12T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	root51	it can, but I would strongly advice against patching grub
2010-02-12T15:44:00.000Z	ikonia	root51	without patching it, nothing
2010-02-12T15:44:00.000Z	ikonia	root51	if you have to ask - don't, more so when you are talking about your boot loader
2010-02-12T15:52:00.000Z	ikonia	root51	it's not an error
2010-02-17T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	root51	share what ?
2010-02-17T18:35:00.000Z	ikonia	root51	I thought we spoke about this before ?
2010-02-17T18:35:00.000Z	ikonia	root51	you where not condifent with the process
2010-02-17T18:37:00.000Z	ikonia	root51	that's grub splash, and we spoke about that also
2010-02-17T18:37:00.000Z	ikonia	root51	that was when you needed to apply a patch and you where not confortable with it
