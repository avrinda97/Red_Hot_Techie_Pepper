2011-10-28T22:16:00.000Z	blz	zykotick9	I appreciate the heads up but i'm assuming he has a valid key.  If he does, there's no moral issue to reinstalling an MBR
2011-10-28T22:17:00.000Z	zykotick9	blz	and OEM key will probably NOT work - but it's illegal do download the iso period!
2011-10-28T22:18:00.000Z	blz	zykotick9	i'll refer you to MrElendig's comment.  You're the one assuming I'm talking about warez
2011-10-28T22:54:00.000Z	zykotick9	blz	the killall suggestion will result in a lock
2011-10-28T22:54:00.000Z	blz	zykotick9	is that right?
2011-10-28T22:54:00.000Z	blz	zykotick9	I (perhaps suptidly) assumed it was a good way to recover from a lock
2011-11-20T06:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	blz	you could check out http://ampache.org/ for audio & video streaming
2011-11-20T06:47:00.000Z	blz	zykotick9	This seems interesting.  Have you used it?
2011-11-20T06:47:00.000Z	zykotick9	blz	ya, but not currently - it's been 6months->1year
2011-11-20T06:48:00.000Z	zykotick9	blz	it even has a built in flash player for video - or can stream to a media player
2011-11-20T06:50:00.000Z	blz	zykotick9	do you know of any handy tutorials for getting this set up on 10.04 or is the documentation good enough?
2011-11-20T06:52:00.000Z	zykotick9	blz	sorry no suggestions for tutorials.  It's in the ubuntu-repo for install though.
2011-11-20T06:52:00.000Z	blz	zykotick9	oh wow, I didn't even think to check
2011-11-20T06:54:00.000Z	blz	zykotick9	last question:  just to be clear, ampache can also stream video, right?  I ask because the description in aptitude search only mentions audio
2011-11-20T06:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	blz	ya video too - it was a new feature, but i'm 90% sure the ubuntu version does it
2011-11-20T06:55:00.000Z	blz	zykotick9	alright perfect!  I'll start working on it tomorrow.  In the meantime, bedtime for me!
2012-10-05T01:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	blz	does the usb speakers show up in alsamixer?  use F6 to select sound cards.  best of luck - i have zero other suggestion (speakers on server doesn't make a lot of sense to me, i'm still assuming you don't have a gui)
2012-10-05T01:55:00.000Z	blz	zykotick9	yes it does!
2012-10-05T01:56:00.000Z	blz	zykotick9	it shows up as "USB AUDIO"  which I assume is what I want =)
2012-10-05T01:57:00.000Z	blz	zykotick9	in fact, I tried setting it from there, but I wasn't too sure how to proceed. When I hilight the entry, I get a mixer bar called PCM whose volume I can set.  So I set it to 100... but now what?
