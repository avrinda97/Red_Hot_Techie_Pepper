2010-10-19T14:38:00.000Z	ectospasm	gaberlunzie	how is "sudo shutdown -h" improper?
2010-10-19T14:38:00.000Z	gaberlunzie	ectospasm	because it means the menu shutdown isnt working .... it's a bug or something
2010-10-19T14:39:00.000Z	gaberlunzie	ectospasm	everything "should" be working properly
2010-10-19T14:39:00.000Z	ectospasm	gaberlunzie	there are many ways to skin a cat.  It's a problem with the GNOME panel or something
2010-10-19T14:40:00.000Z	gaberlunzie	ectospasm	i'm trying to find a fix rather than a workaround
2010-10-19T14:40:00.000Z	ectospasm	gaberlunzie	did you log out and log back in?
2010-10-19T14:41:00.000Z	gaberlunzie	ectospasm	i cant log out either ... hangs just like the shutdown/reboot attempts
2010-10-19T14:42:00.000Z	ectospasm	gaberlunzie	enable CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE (under Preferences/Keyboard/Layout), hit it, and log back in.  See if problem persists
2010-10-19T14:54:00.000Z	gaberlunzie	ectospasm	ctrl-alt-backspace doesnt work, only ctrl-alt-del attempts to log out but still hangs (i've tried it many times before and just now)
2010-10-19T14:55:00.000Z	ectospasm	gaberlunzie	I said to enable CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE
2010-10-19T14:56:00.000Z	gaberlunzie	ectospasm	ctrl+alt+backspace doesnt work, only ctrl-alt-delete, like i said
2010-10-19T14:56:00.000Z	ectospasm	gaberlunzie	System/Preferences/Keyboard/Layout/Options.../Key sequence to kill the X server
2010-10-19T14:57:00.000Z	gaberlunzie	ectospasm	ok, i had to enable it
2010-10-19T14:57:00.000Z	ectospasm	gaberlunzie	yes, I know.  That's why I told you to do it.
2010-10-19T14:58:00.000Z	gaberlunzie	ectospasm	altho, like i said, i was looking for a menu fix rather than a workaround ... brb
2010-10-19T15:01:00.000Z	gaberlunzie	ectospasm	worked good ... any way to map that solution to the logout option of the shutdown menu?
2010-10-19T15:01:00.000Z	ectospasm	gaberlunzie	 it may be a transient issue, that logging out and logging back in will fix.
2010-10-19T15:02:00.000Z	gaberlunzie	ectospasm	ok, that will do for now, thx ... think i'll post a bug report in launchpad
2010-10-19T15:23:00.000Z	ectospasm	gaberlunzie	it's not a bug unless you can repeat it!
2010-10-19T16:13:00.000Z	gaberlunzie	ectospasm	for the system hang on logout/shutdown/restart, i found a simple fix on launchpad ...  reinstall initscripts, lol
2010-10-19T16:13:00.000Z	gaberlunzie	ectospasm	worked like a charm on logout so far   ;)
