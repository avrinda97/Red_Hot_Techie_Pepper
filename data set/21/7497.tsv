2008-05-07T07:47:00.000Z	jc		anyone know how to get optical drives working under hardy?
2008-05-07T07:48:00.000Z	starcannon	jc	like a usb drive or an internal?
2008-05-07T07:48:00.000Z	jc	starcannon	internal - after upgrading from gutsy the drives are not visible  /media/cdrom
2008-05-07T07:49:00.000Z	starcannon	jc	even with media inserted?
2008-05-07T07:49:00.000Z	jc	starcannon	yep the media can be opened with the gui, but from a terminal if I type ls /media/cdrom nothing is there
2008-05-07T07:51:00.000Z	starcannon	jc	odd mine shows up in media, have you looked in mnt or out on the root tree?
2008-05-07T07:53:00.000Z	jc	starcannon	not in mnt yet, I'll do that now
2008-05-07T07:53:00.000Z	jc	starcannon	nothin in mnt, or in the root
2008-05-07T07:54:00.000Z	jc	starcannon	did you do a clean install or an upgrade?
2008-05-07T07:54:00.000Z	starcannon	jc	clean install, i keep /home on a seperate partition so that I can afford that luxury
2008-05-07T07:55:00.000Z	jc	starcannon	I've seen lots of posts in the forum about issues with the optical drives, but so far nothing really helpful
2008-05-07T07:56:00.000Z	jc	starcannon	would you mind showing me 1) your fstab and 2 an ls -la in /media ? want to see how different it is from mine
2008-05-07T07:56:00.000Z	starcannon	jc	sure, hang on i'll pastebin it
2008-05-07T08:08:00.000Z	starcannon	jc	oh thats something i put in there when making a bootable usb drive ignore it
2008-05-07T08:09:00.000Z	jc	starcannon	ok thats good
2008-05-07T08:11:00.000Z	jc	starcannon	thanks, I've changed my fstab to look like yours, its a little better but It's still not totaly right
2008-05-07T08:12:00.000Z	starcannon	jc	are your drives automounting into the correct location now? my uuid's would be different I should think...
2008-05-07T08:13:00.000Z	jc	starcannon	I didn't chagne the UUID's as your right mine would be different, I was more interested in seeing what was pointing to /media/cdrom0 and cdrom1
2008-05-07T08:13:00.000Z	starcannon	jc	nod gotcha
2008-05-07T08:17:00.000Z	starcannon	jc	just in case you didn't have the command already, you can find your uuids by running  sudo vol_id -u /dev/hdc3     note that hdc3 would be replaced by your devices /dev location
2008-05-07T08:20:00.000Z	starcannon	jc	cool tool thanks as well
