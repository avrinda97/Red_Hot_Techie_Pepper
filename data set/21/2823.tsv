2009-06-07T21:10:00.000Z	ARMENIAN	Jack_Sparrow	same thing used to happen in Linux Mint when I had it before, quite odd
2009-06-07T21:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		ARMENIAN I heard quite common in mint, but not usually ubuntu
2009-06-07T21:11:00.000Z	ARMENIAN		if you wanted to you could get ubuntu to look just like linux mint, just takes some more time
