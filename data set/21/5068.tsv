2008-04-04T12:25:00.000Z	icesword	unop	ya,the key file ,what i want to know is,that key is a important file,i want to safely delete it,whick makes recovery impossible,so i want to know if i edit the file,which is a binary file,then save it,will it takes up its origianal location of the disk?
2008-04-04T12:25:00.000Z	icesword	unop	i hope you understand what i mean
2008-04-04T12:27:00.000Z	unop	icesword	if you want to securely delete a file, use something like shred to overwrite the file with some random data -- to answer your original question, if someone recovers a file, it's probably recovered to it's last state .. if you edit a file and save it to disk, there is no guarantee that it will take up it's original location on disk
2008-04-04T12:28:00.000Z	icesword	unop	you know,if you deleted some file,and don't rewrite that location of the file,then recover is possible,i want some cannot recover the file,how thax
