2007-04-02T09:02:00.000Z	aj_	kbrosnan	I tried to uninstall firefox last night and it wouldnt let me
2007-04-02T09:02:00.000Z	kbrosnan	aj_	don't reinstall, in your home folder there is a hidden folder called .mozilla, i need you to find it and rename it while firefox is closed
2007-04-02T09:03:00.000Z	aj_	kbrosnan	give me a sec
2007-04-02T09:09:00.000Z	aj_	kbrosnan	no it actually created another .mozzila folder, I tried it twice
2007-04-02T09:10:00.000Z	kbrosnan	aj_	it should create another .mozilla folder when you start firefox
2007-04-02T09:11:00.000Z	kbrosnan	aj_	did firefox get to yahoo without crashing?
2007-04-02T09:12:00.000Z	aj_	kbrosnan	it goes to yahoo, but when I try to login it crashes
2007-04-02T09:13:00.000Z	kbrosnan	aj_	still after making a new profile
2007-04-02T09:13:00.000Z	aj_	kbrosnan	it goes to yahoo, only crashes when I try to login
2007-04-02T09:14:00.000Z	aj_	kbrosnan	you are a god
2007-04-02T09:14:00.000Z	kbrosnan	aj_	it works now with the new .mozilla?
2007-04-02T09:15:00.000Z	aj_	kbrosnan	why was that happening
2007-04-02T09:16:00.000Z	kbrosnan	aj_	the most likely reason is a confilicting problem with the free flash plugin and the adobe flash plugin. Having both makes firefox very unstable
2007-04-02T09:16:00.000Z	aj_	kbrosnan	it worked with firefox
2007-04-02T09:17:00.000Z	kbrosnan	aj_	if you need to recover some of the data in your old profile http://kb.mozillazine.org/Migrating_settings_to_a_new_profile is a very helpful article
2007-04-02T09:17:00.000Z	aj_	kbrosnan	I didnt really want the mozzila browser I just wanted to try an alternate browser to see if I got the same result
2007-04-02T09:18:00.000Z	aj_	kbrosnan	nah I just installed 4 days ago havent really done anything yet
2007-04-02T09:20:00.000Z	aj_	kbrosnan	thanx for all your help I was getting pretty frustrated with that problem
