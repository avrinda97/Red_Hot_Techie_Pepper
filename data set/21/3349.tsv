2009-01-19T14:44:00.000Z	Pyru		Hello, I am a new Ubuntu user. I have installed wine so i can emulate a 2d game I really like to play. Anyways the game is a java based game and seems to be running really choppy. What can I do to improve the performance?
2009-01-19T14:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC	Pyru	 some reason the java game cant work with the normal java? thats sort of the point of java

2009-01-19T14:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC		IF its written right
2009-01-19T14:46:00.000Z	Pyru		it's written in java but there is a client installer, packed with dll's and crap.
2009-01-19T14:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC	Pyru	 what game is this anyway?
2009-01-19T14:47:00.000Z	Pyru		Darkquest. It's a runescape classic remake :P (dunno if you ever heard of it)
2009-01-19T14:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC		I belvie ive gotten runescape working in my browser.. but perhaps that was a diffrent variant.
2009-01-19T14:48:00.000Z	Pyru	Dr_Willis_ZNC	yes, it was different. This has an installer, which installs the client.
2009-01-19T14:48:00.000Z	Pyru		No clue why it's so choppy
2009-01-19T14:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC		running java in wine  sounds like a good reason to be choppy
2009-01-19T14:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC		hmm the runescape web site sent working for me now either.. it used to.. months ago

2009-01-19T14:50:00.000Z	Pyru		if you are interested
2009-01-19T14:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC	Pyru	 i got the  web runescape going.. and i rember why i never played it.. :P
2009-01-19T14:54:00.000Z	Pyru	Dr_Willis_ZNC	yes I agree hehe. I just have alot of old friends that play, I help them develop graphics for this "re-make" game so to say
2009-01-19T14:55:00.000Z	Pyru	Dr_Willis_ZNC	when I play it's really choppy, but this isn't the web based. This is a client that is installed.
2009-01-19T14:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC		pyru yes. i see that.. i cant even login because i got no account :)  it seems to be using 'jet' some sort of comercial Java-add-on-thinggie.. so good luck
2009-01-19T14:58:00.000Z	Pyru	Dr_Willis_ZNC	i can create you an account very quickly if you would like?
2009-01-19T14:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_ZNC	Pyru	i just uninstalled the game. :)
2009-01-19T14:59:00.000Z	Pyru	Dr_Willis_ZNC	awe =( heh just made a test account
