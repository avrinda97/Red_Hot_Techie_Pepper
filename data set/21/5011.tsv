2008-01-16T13:29:00.000Z	LurkersA		Hey Guys. The sound just stopped on my Gutsy, It says the resource is busy, how do I refresh it or make it unbusy?
2008-01-16T13:31:00.000Z	dessnr	LurkersA	Throw a brick at it!  It won't be so f**cking busy then will it?  No, go into your sound prefs and then click reset sound server.  Wait, are you in Gnome or Kbuntu?
2008-01-16T13:31:00.000Z	LurkersA	dessnr	GNOME
2008-01-16T13:33:00.000Z	dessnr	LurkersA	OK.  Go into prefs > sound and note down what it is set to for your selected sound.  Then switch the sound to OSS mode, then back to the one that you noted.  See how that goes....
2008-01-16T13:33:00.000Z	LurkersA	dessnr	Nothing...After I did it I clicked test and it says "audiotestsrc wave=sine freq=512 ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! gconfaudiosink: Resource busy or not available."
2008-01-16T13:34:00.000Z	dessnr	LurkersA	Strange.  I've never come across that problem.  Keep asking, perhaps someone else has.
2008-01-16T13:34:00.000Z	LurkersA	dessnr	Thanks
2008-01-16T13:35:00.000Z	dessnr	LurkersA	Go into the sound settings again, but when you click OSS, click OK as though you are going to keep the setting.  Then come back in, and select the default.  See if that works...
2008-01-16T13:36:00.000Z	LurkersA	dessnr	Still nothing
2008-01-16T13:38:00.000Z	dessnr	LurkersA	I'll have a look around, give me a min or two...
2008-01-16T13:38:00.000Z	LurkersA	dessnr	Thanks
2008-01-16T13:39:00.000Z	dessnr	LurkersA	"If you change the permissions on the /dev/dsp and /dev/audio devices to 666 it seams to fix the problem. My problem started after I used EasyUbuntu."  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=325428
2008-01-16T13:40:00.000Z	LurkersA	dessnr	How would I go about doing that?
2008-01-16T13:41:00.000Z	dessnr	LurkersA	I have no idea, I was hoping you knew that part.  Let me go into dev/dsp and have a look...
2008-01-16T13:43:00.000Z	LurkersA	dessnr	Thanks
2008-01-16T13:44:00.000Z	dessnr	LurkersA	I don't think this is the way that we should go actually.  This fix does not work for everybody by the looks of it.  Let me look for an alt.
2008-01-16T13:46:00.000Z	LurkersA	dessnr	Thanks
2008-01-16T13:52:00.000Z	dessnr	LurkersA	Have you got easyubuntu installed?  Not that it matters, because it seems that there is no promising fix for this problem.  I would stick around and ask for a while.  Hopefully somebody will have a fix for it....
2008-01-16T13:53:00.000Z	LurkersA	dessnr	No, not EasyUbuntu. Is it software?
2008-01-16T13:54:00.000Z	dessnr	LurkersA	No, it's a cut down version of Ubuntu as far as I know.  Like xubuntu...
2008-01-16T13:54:00.000Z	LurkersA	dessnr	Ah.
