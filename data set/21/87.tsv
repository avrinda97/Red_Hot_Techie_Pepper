2012-09-21T22:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	cboss	 not really. You could change the cache location withs ome links.
2012-09-21T22:59:00.000Z	cboss	dr_willis	thanks for the reply! Thats a shame, what will happen when the hard drive fills up? I wont be able to install any more applications?
2012-09-21T23:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	cboss	 if your HD is full.. you got bigger issues i imagine
2012-09-21T23:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	cboss	 linux makes it trivial to move stuff like /tmp/ and /var/ and /home/ to other hard drives
2012-09-21T23:02:00.000Z	cboss	dr_willis	I installed ubuntu side by side with windows, and i only chose 10GB of space and i am really enjoying ubuntu, however i running out of space quickly, if i move directories across to my secondary hard drive, will the applications still work?
2012-09-21T23:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	cboss	 yes. if you do it right.. the power of mount and links :)
2012-09-21T23:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	cboss	 you should be learnng some more linux fundamentals.   'ln -s' is how to make a soft link from one location to a differnt location.
2012-09-21T23:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	cboss	 or you can move your /home/ to its own hard drive/partition  since most of the space will be the users stuff
2012-09-21T23:05:00.000Z	cboss	dr_willis	will that cause any problems with dual booting or will i lose any data?
2012-09-21T23:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	cboss	 not if you do it right
2012-09-21T23:06:00.000Z	cboss	dr_willis	wont i have to unmount that partition?
2012-09-21T23:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	cboss	 you dont resize a in use filesystem.. so yes.
2012-09-21T23:08:00.000Z	cboss	dr_willis	/dev/sda3 is mount point /host, would that be the one i am looking to enlarge?
2012-09-21T23:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	cboss	 /host/ ? You did a WUBI install IN windows?
2012-09-21T23:09:00.000Z	cboss	dr_willis	will that mean i have to create a live DVD
2012-09-21T23:09:00.000Z	cboss	dr_willis	yes thats correct
2012-09-21T23:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	cboss	 i suggest doing a normal install.. and forgetting  wubi even exists..
2012-09-21T23:10:00.000Z	cboss	dr_willis	i find that idea unsettling due to my knowledge and experience level
2012-09-21T23:11:00.000Z	cboss	dr_willis	would it be possible to uninstall ubuntu (via window) then reinstall and select a more appropriate hard drive size?
