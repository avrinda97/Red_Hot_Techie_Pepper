2006-10-20T05:42:00.000Z	UKMatt		are there any Ubuntu programs that I can use to transcode from .m4a (apple's unprotected) to .mp3?
2006-10-20T05:43:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	yes, mplayer
2006-10-20T05:43:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	yes.
2006-10-20T05:44:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	search google, there are a couple of scripts.
2006-10-20T05:45:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	Places>Search for files...
2006-10-20T05:46:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	put in name contains "*.m4a"
2006-10-20T05:47:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	or select more options..
2006-10-20T05:48:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	well the default is to look in your /home... you can change that
2006-10-20T05:48:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	works just fine for me.
2006-10-20T05:49:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	Look for in... select "Filesystem" and for the Name contains *.m4a
2006-10-20T05:49:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	Places>Search for files...
2006-10-20T05:50:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	did you get it? it wont find any m4a files if you dont have any on your ubuntu install
2006-10-20T05:51:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	i'm on edgy, might make a difference.
2006-10-20T05:52:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	Yeah. I've been running edgy since knot 1
2006-10-20T05:54:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	you can try *.m4a in "Name matches Regular Expression" i dont know if that will work or not
2006-10-20T05:57:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	sudo find / -name *.m4a
2006-10-20T05:57:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	type that in terminal
2006-10-20T05:58:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	it will take a minute or so for the command to finish but it will search your system for any filenames that have .m4a
2006-10-20T06:00:00.000Z	ks1	UKMatt	did that work for you? find anything?
