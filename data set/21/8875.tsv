2006-06-12T15:50:00.000Z	adam_		Hi guys. I have a slight problem - I just ran the pear manager to install the base pear modules for php, but it exited with errors, which is ok. The problem is that it also deleted /tmp :( I have now recreated it, but I am not sure what permissions to give it, and i think it is caused my system to have some problems. The perms are currently drwxrwxrwt, and it is green in the terminal. Can anyone help me out? thanks
2006-06-12T15:50:00.000Z	gnube	adam_	Yeah, not having the right permissions will affect your system.
2006-06-12T15:51:00.000Z	adam_	gnube	thanks. Can you tell me what permissions I should have set?
2006-06-12T15:51:00.000Z	gnube	adam_	A lot of programs write to /tmp  . . .
2006-06-12T15:51:00.000Z	gnube	adam_	Let me check mine . . . brb
2006-06-12T15:52:00.000Z	gnube	adam_	I have it chowned by root and chmoded 777
2006-06-12T15:52:00.000Z	gnube	adam_	try that?
2006-06-12T15:54:00.000Z	adam_	gnube	It doesnt seem to have helped. The whole /tmp directory was removed, will this cause issues for apps (e.g. konsole, which is having issues) that presumably store data there? Should I just do a reboot?
2006-06-12T15:55:00.000Z	gnube	adam_	Yeah, you need to make sure that /tmp exists and has the proper permissions since a lot of applications write to /tmp
2006-06-12T15:56:00.000Z	gnube	adam_	did you chown /tmp root?
2006-06-12T15:56:00.000Z	adam_	gnube	I have done that, it is root:root, 777
2006-06-12T15:56:00.000Z	gnube	adam_	OK
2006-06-12T15:56:00.000Z	gnube	adam_	You should not have to reboot.
2006-06-12T15:56:00.000Z	gnube	adam_	Although you may   . . . since certain session files may be missing.
2006-06-12T15:57:00.000Z	gnube	adam_	Are you getting any errors now?
2006-06-12T15:58:00.000Z	adam_	gnube	yeah, still the same. Running konsole from the command line (err, in konsole) produces the error "konsole: cannot connect to X server :0.0". Argh
2006-06-12T15:58:00.000Z	gnube	adam_	Yeah, that is because the X server wants to write session stuff, try rebooting.
2006-06-12T15:59:00.000Z	adam_	gnube	- ok. Thank you very much! If I am not back soon it means that 1) Im stuck in failsafe, or 2) it worked :p thanks again
2006-06-12T15:59:00.000Z	gnube	adam_	No problem and good luck
2006-06-12T16:04:00.000Z	adam_	gnube	thank you very much, it seems to have worked fine.
2006-06-12T16:05:00.000Z	gnube	adam_	My pleasure, it has happened to me too so I know what it is like.
