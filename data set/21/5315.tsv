2008-04-22T15:34:00.000Z	stippi		is there an Ubuntu tool to change the partition type of a partition?
2008-04-22T15:34:00.000Z	ikonia	stippi	fdisk
2008-04-22T15:34:00.000Z	stippi	ikonia	thanks, can it change just the type and nothing else?
2008-04-22T15:34:00.000Z	ikonia	stippi	sudo fdisk $disk
2008-04-22T15:34:00.000Z	ikonia	stippi	then it's menu driven
2008-04-22T15:35:00.000Z	stippi	ikonia	thanks a bunch!
2008-04-22T15:35:00.000Z	stippi	ikonia	one more question maybe
2008-04-22T15:35:00.000Z	ikonia	stippi	sure
2008-04-22T15:36:00.000Z	stippi	ikonia	long story short, Windows appearantly fixed my installation by setting the type of the "rescue" partition to "empty"
2008-04-22T15:36:00.000Z	ikonia	stippi	ok
2008-04-22T15:36:00.000Z	stippi	ikonia	this appearantly shifted all my partition numbers by -1
2008-04-22T15:37:00.000Z	stippi	ikonia	I managed to get it all working again
2008-04-22T15:37:00.000Z	ikonia	stippi	with you so far
2008-04-22T15:37:00.000Z	stippi	ikonia	but I am wondering, I have an extended partition
2008-04-22T15:37:00.000Z	stippi	ikonia	and grub needs the old numbers for booting stuff in logical partitions
2008-04-22T15:37:00.000Z	stippi	ikonia	is this expected?
2008-04-22T15:38:00.000Z	ikonia	stippi	expected, debatable, unusual, no. If your using ubuntu 7.10 investigate using uuid numbers for grub
2008-04-22T15:38:00.000Z	stippi	ikonia	ie (hd0, 5) is still (hd0, 5), while I needed to substract -1 from all primary partitions
2008-04-22T15:39:00.000Z	stippi	ikonia	for example, if I have only one primary partition and one extended partition, would the first logical partition on the extended partition still be (hd0, 5)?
2008-04-22T15:40:00.000Z	ikonia	stippi	grubs behaviour on this is debatable and a bit random due to the slightest changes, can alter how it behaves
2008-04-22T15:40:00.000Z	stippi	ikonia	ok, thanks
