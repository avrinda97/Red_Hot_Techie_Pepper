2012-04-03T22:21:00.000Z	hylian	Shappy	hello
2012-04-03T22:23:00.000Z	hylian	Shappy	i use ssh to connect to a long distance computer all the time. I don't have that problem...??
2012-04-03T22:23:00.000Z	Shappy	hylian	this is a network place (Places > Connect to server...), not inside the terminal
2012-04-03T22:28:00.000Z	hylian	Shappy	maybe i can get the same problem to happen here. what exactly are you using to ssh? maybe i can find something...
2012-04-03T22:29:00.000Z	hylian	Shappy	and i connect to sdf.org's free shell access via ssh. so i am not a whole lot of help either...
2012-04-03T22:29:00.000Z	Shappy	hylian	I'm connecting to an SSH location via Places > Connect to server... > SSH, it opens an SFTP connection. While it's connecting it freezes. You usually don't notice it because it connects instantly but if can't it'll just hang and wait for timeout
2012-04-03T22:29:00.000Z	hylian	Shappy	ill try that and see what happens
2012-04-03T22:31:00.000Z	hylian	Shappy	it worked perfectly for me, i continously was clicking applecations on/off. I am running 12.04 beta though, so prehaps they have solved this issue?
2012-04-03T22:31:00.000Z	Shappy	hylian	have you tried connecting to a non-existing location like ssh://am.not.here.com ?
2012-04-03T22:31:00.000Z	hylian	Shappy	no, but let me try that now...
2012-04-03T22:33:00.000Z	hylian	Shappy	I still had no problems with the bar on top. This could be because I am using Gnome 3 in classic mode, or because I am using Ubuntu 12.04 beta... or who knows what other reason... sorry.
2012-04-03T22:33:00.000Z	Shappy	hylian	just for the heck of it try connecting to google.com with Connect to server... via SSH
2012-04-03T22:34:00.000Z	hylian	Shappy	you  bet, here i go into oblivion, LOL
2012-04-03T22:35:00.000Z	hylian	Shappy	again, applications and places stay fully useable. I never connect to google, ofcoarse... some google admin somewhere is going "what in tarnation..."
2012-04-03T22:37:00.000Z	hylian	Shappy	my system is just too different from yours, not just in hardware. I really tweak my version of Ubuntu. who knows what is causing the problem.
2012-04-03T22:38:00.000Z	hylian	Shappy	sorry i wasn't very helpful. :(
2012-04-03T22:38:00.000Z	Shappy	hylian	it's fine
2012-04-03T22:40:00.000Z	hylian	Shappy	if it happens again, maybe you could log out of unity and try another desktop environment. then if the problem goes away, you have a direction to go with this. Only a thought...
2012-04-03T22:42:00.000Z	Shappy	hylian	again, I'm on 10.04 without Unity
2012-04-03T22:43:00.000Z	hylian	Shappy	oops, missed that post. :0
