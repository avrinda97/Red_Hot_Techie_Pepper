2011-01-09T05:23:00.000Z	technicianTom		hello. upon running "sudo ./configure && make && make install" I get the following error and it exits > /usr/bin/install: cannot create regular file `/usr/local/lib/libogg.so.0.7.1': Permission denied
2011-01-09T05:23:00.000Z	technicianTom		can anyone point me in the right direction for such a simple problem
2011-01-09T05:24:00.000Z	technicianTom		ahh
2011-01-09T05:25:00.000Z	technicianTom		well I ran the whole chain because ./configure wasn't creating a make or makefile
2011-01-09T05:25:00.000Z	technicianTom		what I used && it seemed to work fine
2011-01-09T05:25:00.000Z	technicianTom		any suggestions with that?
2011-01-09T05:26:00.000Z	iflema	technicianTom	try ./configure && make && sudo make install
2011-01-09T05:27:00.000Z	iflema	technicianTom	with a sudo in front aswell
2011-01-09T05:27:00.000Z	technicianTom	iflema	thanks let me try.
2011-01-09T05:33:00.000Z	technicianTom	iflema	thanks for the help. seems to be working like it should have the first time. I have no idea what went wrong the first few times I tried.
2011-01-09T05:34:00.000Z	iflema	technicianTom	the 'install' part needs SuperUser rights and each command that needs, needs it :P
2011-01-09T05:37:00.000Z	technicianTom	iflema	yeah I feel stupid. sudo is messing me up. thanks though.
2011-01-09T05:37:00.000Z	iflema	technicianTom	there is also       sudo -i         which will run the termina as root, ctrl+D or 'exit'  when finished.....
2011-01-09T05:37:00.000Z	technicianTom	iflema	oh ok thanks. that helps a lot. not so much of an annoyance having to sudo things all the time.
2011-01-09T05:40:00.000Z	iflema	technicianTom	yes, but careful now..... graphical app should use gksudo and non-graphical sudo....
2011-01-09T05:42:00.000Z	technicianTom	iflema	I don't understand what you mean. can you explain that a bit more?
2011-01-09T05:45:00.000Z	iflema	technicianTom	for apps that run GUI you use 'gksudo <application>' and apps that don not use GUI you use 'sudo <application>'   so if you  'sudo -i'     and mix both GUI and non GUI apps.......
2011-01-09T05:48:00.000Z	technicianTom	iflema	I see.
2011-01-09T05:50:00.000Z	iflema	technicianTom	i made her say that, shes a bot... =)
2011-01-09T05:51:00.000Z	technicianTom	iflema	saw that lol after the fact
2011-01-09T07:14:00.000Z	technicianTom	iflema	you there?
