2009-03-30T16:37:00.000Z	Jess3		you asked a question ?
2009-03-30T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Jess3	could reinstall vista but leave space unpartitioned for linux, no need for resizing then :D
2009-03-30T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1		planned partitions are happy partitions
2009-03-30T16:41:00.000Z	Jess3		I am trying to install Ubuntu 8.10 to my brothers laptop in a dual boot, dl'd the desktop version, ran the sumcheck (everything in order), put in the CD booted nice, went through the graph installation procedure, all fine, then when it starts installing (after partitioning) it gives the same error msg overan over again: " [#####.######]VFS: busy inodes on charged media" where the # are diff numbers each line. How can I make it install correctl
2009-03-30T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Jess3	what speed did you burn the cd?

2009-03-30T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Jess3	burn as SLOW as you are allowed
2009-03-30T16:42:00.000Z	Jess3		ok
2009-03-30T16:42:00.000Z	Jess3		gratz VeryApe
2009-03-30T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Jess3	burning stuff at max makes for a poor burn towards the end and saves about a minute of time, a slow burn makes a better impression on the disk and usually gives better results
2009-03-30T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Jess3	also run the disk checker on the first boot screen to ensure the burned disk is ok. the md5 check you did is awesome (loads of people fail to check them)
2009-03-30T16:44:00.000Z	Jess3		i did check it btw; everything in order
2009-03-30T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Jess3	cool, just burn slower and you should be ok, you could also try
2009-03-30T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1		!bootoptions
2009-03-30T16:45:00.000Z	Jess3	ActionParsnip1	I take it 1x is over the top ?
2009-03-30T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Jess3	if you can do it, I'd use it
2009-03-30T16:45:00.000Z	Jess3		ok
2009-03-30T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Jess3	the slowest I get is 4x which I always use
2009-03-30T16:46:00.000Z	Jess3	ActionParsnip1	get infrarecorder :p
