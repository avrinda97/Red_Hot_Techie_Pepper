2006-04-08T08:19:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	more than one disk?
2006-04-08T08:20:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	I mean harddisks
2006-04-08T08:20:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	ok, than it makes sense
2006-04-08T08:21:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	ok, I need a quick overview: where is your ubuntu installation and where is your windows installation
2006-04-08T08:23:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	ok, your problem makes sense
2006-04-08T08:24:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	ok,  when you installed, it showed something like /dev/hdb or /dev/hda, do you remember what you installed to?
2006-04-08T08:26:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	what you can try: change the disk order in the bios to see if it boots at all
2006-04-08T08:26:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	but it should
2006-04-08T08:26:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	What you need to do to solve your problem:
2006-04-08T08:27:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	right, if you do that, it will boot, but let's try to fix the problem
2006-04-08T08:28:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	you need to install the grub bootloader in the master boot record of the windows xp disk
2006-04-08T08:28:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	and I guess you have no clue how to do that, right?
2006-04-08T08:29:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	multi disc boot is a funny thing ...
2006-04-08T08:29:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	you can try the following: boot from the installation (not live!) cd and choose rescue mode
2006-04-08T08:30:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	you can then select the disc where you're linux is on and install the grub bootloader in the disc where windows xp is on
2006-04-08T08:31:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	reboot, try that and if you have any questions don't write anything to your harddisk but instead come back and ask
2006-04-08T08:31:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	I will stay here
2006-04-08T08:32:00.000Z	giftnudel	Joyern	good luck!
