2008-04-05T20:58:00.000Z	Xorothal	keiserr	yes
2008-04-05T21:00:00.000Z	keiserr	Xorothal	then its the seventh disk i am burning and all are failing at retrieiving the same exact file! am soon gonna be having a lot of ubuntu 7.10 sever CD lying around, and i am soon going to be short on blank CDs
2008-04-05T21:00:00.000Z	Xorothal	keiserr	maybe your drive is brokened
2008-04-05T21:01:00.000Z	keiserr	Xorothal	i tried with 3 different drives, thel ast drive was a NEW drive which i have never used... usedi t today (as in just openned form the box)
2008-04-05T21:02:00.000Z	keiserr	Xorothal	The disk works fine on THIS machine
2008-04-05T21:02:00.000Z	Xorothal	keiserr	you mean it boots up, and works perfectly on one machine but not another?
2008-04-05T21:03:00.000Z	Xorothal	keiserr	?
2008-04-05T21:04:00.000Z	Xorothal	keiserr	then it's your machine that's broken
2008-04-05T21:05:00.000Z	keiserr	Xorothal	: explain .. i can't make sense of that
2008-04-05T21:05:00.000Z	Xorothal	keiserr	the problem is not with the disc, but with the machine
2008-04-05T21:07:00.000Z	Xorothal	keiserr	possibly, or you could use samba and smbmount onto the directory
2008-04-05T21:08:00.000Z	Xorothal	keiserr	on a windows box
2008-04-05T21:08:00.000Z	keiserr	Xorothal	i don't have windows
2008-04-05T21:09:00.000Z	Xorothal	keiserr	what did you think I meant?
2008-04-05T21:09:00.000Z	Xorothal	keiserr	yes
2008-04-05T21:10:00.000Z	Xorothal	keiserr	but bear in mind what I'm saying is an educated guess at most
2008-04-05T21:10:00.000Z	Xorothal	keiserr	are you getting a gui/terminal?
2008-04-05T21:10:00.000Z	keiserr	Xorothal	: i am on macosx right now
2008-04-05T21:13:00.000Z	Xorothal	keiserr	 is the machine which mac os x is installed on the one that gives you errors?
