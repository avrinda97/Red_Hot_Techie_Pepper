2010-02-14T11:12:00.000Z	magn3ts		I'm having major apt problems with my kernel/modules: http://pastebin.ca/1795980 I'm scared to reboot. Can someone help me resolve this? Thanks!
2010-02-14T11:13:00.000Z	magn3ts		never mind, it looks like I need to do a dist-upgrade
2010-02-14T11:14:00.000Z	montyboy	magn3ts	not htat big of a deal. you're using a backport for your alsa sound and it was compiled against the older kernel
2010-02-14T11:15:00.000Z	magn3ts	montyboy	actually it looks like alsa backport got installed but the kernel that it was based on didnt
2010-02-14T11:16:00.000Z	montyboy	magn3ts	MBP 5.x?
2010-02-14T11:16:00.000Z	magn3ts	montyboy	hehe, yes.
2010-02-14T11:16:00.000Z	magn3ts	montyboy	how'd ya know
2010-02-14T11:16:00.000Z	montyboy	magn3ts	me too - are you trying to dist-upgrade to 9.10?
2010-02-14T11:16:00.000Z	magn3ts	montyboy	no, but I just installed 9.10 and I'm trying to fix the audio
2010-02-14T11:17:00.000Z	montyboy	magn3ts	where did you get the backport alsa?
2010-02-14T11:19:00.000Z	montyboy	magn3ts	use the ppa mactel repo
2010-02-14T11:19:00.000Z	magn3ts	montyboy	I have it added already
2010-02-14T11:19:00.000Z	magn3ts	montyboy	oh, do they have it patched in the ppa repo?
2010-02-14T11:20:00.000Z	montyboy	magn3ts	i just did a rebuild of my mbp today and that's the repo i have listed and my alsa is working
2010-02-14T11:21:00.000Z	montyboy	magn3ts	though, my kernel is 2.6.31-19-generic x86_64
2010-02-14T11:25:00.000Z	montyboy	magn3ts	have you rebooted into the new kernel?
2010-02-14T11:26:00.000Z	magn3ts	montyboy	no
2010-02-14T11:26:00.000Z	montyboy	magn3ts	do it, your old one is still there
2010-02-14T11:27:00.000Z	montyboy	magn3ts	do a uname -r and tell me what it reads
2010-02-14T11:28:00.000Z	montyboy	magn3ts	ok, so when you reboot you will have 2 choice (at least) you will have 2.6.31-14 and 2.6.31-20
2010-02-14T11:28:00.000Z	montyboy	magn3ts	boot into the new one and then try the alsa package again
