2007-10-12T13:45:00.000Z	L0GAN		btw how can I make a live CD with some custom apps pre-installed?
2007-10-12T13:46:00.000Z	L0GAN		for example I want to add blender and videolan as default apps
2007-10-12T13:47:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	L0GAN	system -> preferences -> preffered applications or a right click on a file and "open with"
2007-10-14T14:23:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	L0GAN	you mean partition?
2007-10-14T14:23:00.000Z	L0GAN	FallenHitokiri	: i know it depends on number of installed apps ofcourse
2007-10-14T14:24:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	L0GAN	sorry I have no idea about wubi. But I use 5gb for / and the rest for /home to store my user data on. so if you go with 5gb you can assign the rest of your space later
2007-10-14T14:25:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	L0GAN	5GB are with all apps I need only 60% full, so enough space for /tmp and /var (which should be on a seperate partition)
2007-10-14T14:25:00.000Z	L0GAN	FallenHitokiri	: but its on to use windows formatted partitions for storage of documents and files?
2007-10-14T14:25:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	L0GAN	what filesystem do you want to use?
2007-10-14T14:26:00.000Z	L0GAN	FallenHitokiri	: I still need to decide
2007-10-14T14:26:00.000Z	L0GAN	FallenHitokiri	: I now use win2000 with fat32
2007-10-14T14:27:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	L0GAN	if you go with ext3 everything is fine, just install the ext3 driver for windows (ext3 - linux native fs) if you use ntfs wait for gutsy, ntfs3g with read / write access is available. but fat is no real choice, a fs without journaling is nothing you want if your system crashes
2007-10-14T14:27:00.000Z	L0GAN	FallenHitokiri	: wubi makes some virtual disk
2007-10-14T14:27:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	L0GAN	sorry but I really cannot help you with wubi
2007-10-14T14:28:00.000Z	L0GAN	FallenHitokiri	: another question, will future versions of ubuntu auto detect usb withh casper-rw partition to automatically be in persistent mode?
2007-10-14T14:28:00.000Z	L0GAN	FallenHitokiri	: persistent for live cd
2007-10-14T14:29:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	L0GAN	I use no livecd and I am no developer so I cannot answer this, sorry
2007-10-14T14:29:00.000Z	L0GAN	FallenHitokiri	: live mode is cool I think, neds no install and is like having portable ubuntu
2007-10-14T14:29:00.000Z	L0GAN	FallenHitokiri	: only i dont get persistent working
2007-10-14T14:30:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	L0GAN	if I need a live cd I use it for forensics or recovery,... if I need a mobile linux I got my laptop ;)
2007-10-14T14:31:00.000Z	L0GAN	FallenHitokiri	: ah yes, I only have usb stick, lo laptop. Its also nice to take to friends and show ubuntu to them
