2009-12-30T15:35:00.000Z	alberto		I don't know what to do to make my NVIDIA GeForce 7050 work in Ubuntu Jaunty, after having downgraded from Karmic, leaving the /home directory without changes.
2009-12-30T15:36:00.000Z	alberto		Everytime I start the computer, the screen resolutions sets automatically to 800x600
2009-12-30T15:37:00.000Z	legend2440	alberto	can you paste your  /etc/X11/xorg.conf  file?
2009-12-30T15:37:00.000Z	legend2440		!paste

2009-12-30T15:41:00.000Z	alberto	legend2440	If I'm not wrong, that's an ATI card
2009-12-30T15:42:00.000Z	legend2440	alberto	ModelName      "CMO CMC 19AW" ? thats what nvidia-settings says your monitor is
2009-12-30T15:43:00.000Z	alberto	legend2440	Do you see anything wrong in my xorg.conf?
2009-12-30T15:44:00.000Z	legend2440	alberto	i would try this    Option         "metamodes" "1280x1024 +0+0" only replace   1280x1024   wirh the resolution you want
2009-12-30T15:46:00.000Z	legend2440	alberto	did you comment this line out?   # Removed Option "metamodes" "1440x900 +0+0"  or did nvidia settings
2009-12-30T15:46:00.000Z	alberto	legend2440	Nvidia settings, actually.
