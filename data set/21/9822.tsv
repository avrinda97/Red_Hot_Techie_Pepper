2005-07-06T05:32:00.000Z	sara_poo__		whats the default cd-recording application with a ubuntu install?
2005-07-06T05:32:00.000Z	sara_poo__		running gnome
2005-07-06T05:33:00.000Z	Seveas	sara_poo__	gnomebaker or graveman
2005-07-06T05:33:00.000Z	sara_poo__	Seveas	thanks, what one do you prefer?
2005-07-06T05:33:00.000Z	sara_poo__	Seveas	for disc -> disc backups
2005-07-06T05:33:00.000Z	Seveas	sara_poo__	neither, I like both
2005-07-06T05:33:00.000Z	sara_poo__	Seveas	lol, ok.  What one do you think i should start with, for disc -> disc backups
2005-07-06T05:34:00.000Z	sara_poo__	Seveas	thanks
2005-07-06T05:55:00.000Z	Seveas	sara_poo__	do you hear system sounds..?
2005-07-06T05:56:00.000Z	Seveas	sara_poo__	do you have multiple sound cards (like a built-in one and a real card)
2005-07-06T05:56:00.000Z	sara_poo__	Seveas	nope, just a built in one.  On my previous distro I used the snd_via82xx module, with alsa
2005-07-06T05:57:00.000Z	Seveas	sara_poo__	hmm, what does amixer say?
2005-07-06T05:58:00.000Z	sara_poo__	Seveas	not a whole lot, everything appears to be fine
2005-07-06T05:58:00.000Z	sara_poo__	Seveas	alsamixer notices my card as a VIA 8237 correctly
2005-07-06T05:58:00.000Z	Seveas	sara_poo__	aha, is it muted in any way..?
2005-07-06T05:59:00.000Z	sara_poo__	Seveas	doesn't look like it.  'mute' in a terminal is not found... not a command
2005-07-06T05:59:00.000Z	Seveas	sara_poo__	in alsamixer you can see it...
2005-07-06T05:59:00.000Z	Seveas	sara_poo__	try: mpg321 -o esd
2005-07-06T06:00:00.000Z	Seveas	sara_poo__	ubuntu uses esd, so mpg321 needs to be told to use esd
2005-07-06T06:00:00.000Z	sara_poo__	Seveas	same results with -o esd
2005-07-06T06:00:00.000Z	Seveas	sara_poo__	ok: what does lsof | grep /dev/dsp say?
