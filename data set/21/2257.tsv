2010-10-25T15:37:00.000Z	SAngeli		Hi I am having something very very strange. Anytime I burn a CD-ROM with ubuntu server either 32 or 64 bit when it goes to verify the cd it finds errors (I have changed several CD-ROMs). I try to install the system and while installing it I get corrupted files. What do I have to do???
2010-10-25T15:37:00.000Z	SAngeli		I download it from this site: http://www.ubuntu.com/server/get-ubuntu/download
2010-10-25T15:38:00.000Z	SAngeli		Do I have to use a CD-ROM or a DVD-ROM ???
2010-10-25T15:38:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	SAngeli	either.
2010-10-25T15:39:00.000Z	SAngeli	SpaceGhostC2C	ok, but how do I solve this issue?
2010-10-25T15:39:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	SAngeli	Well, technically a CD-R or DVD-R
2010-10-25T15:39:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	SAngeli	Burn slower?
2010-10-25T15:40:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	SAngeli	you can if you want.
2010-10-25T15:41:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	SAngeli	The issue doesn't happen in the verifiction process, but when you are burning it. did you md5sum the image you downloaded of ubuntu server?
2010-10-25T15:42:00.000Z	SAngeli	SpaceGhostC2C	where do I get this md5sum? I am in windows 7 OSÃ¹
2010-10-25T15:42:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	SAngeli	On the website. Google also has information "Ubuntu iso md5sum"
2010-10-25T15:48:00.000Z	SAngeli	SpaceGhostC2C	Krishnandu I have performed the md5sum and they are correct
2010-10-25T15:48:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	SAngeli	So, burn the disk no faster than 8X
2010-10-25T15:49:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	SAngeli	do it at no faster than 8x
2010-10-25T15:49:00.000Z	SAngeli	SpaceGhostC2C	let's see. It is the first time I get this issue
2010-10-25T16:02:00.000Z	SAngeli	SpaceGhostC2C	I have done as you told me and also checked the md5sum but this is always what I get (having downloaded the files off the official ubuntu website. http://img267.imageshack.us/f/immaginekqg.png/
2010-10-25T16:03:00.000Z	SAngeli	SpaceGhostC2C	si it something that has to do with the phisical CD-ROM that you think?
2010-10-25T16:03:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	SAngeli	It's possible.
2010-10-25T16:04:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	SAngeli	Do you have a need for a complex partitioning scheme?
2010-10-25T16:04:00.000Z	SAngeli	SpaceGhostC2C	I just want to install the server to find out if hylafax works. I guess I will try to install ubuntu desktop at this point
2010-10-25T16:05:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	SAngeli	mmk, good luck.
