2008-08-29T19:30:00.000Z	DavidCanarias		Hi, Sometimes I find the text is garbled in chat lines. Any ideas how I can avoid this? Is it a problem of fonts?
2008-08-29T19:30:00.000Z	Pici	DavidCanarias	Garbled how?
2008-08-29T19:32:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	Pici	- for example the first few words are readable and the rest illegible and the final words O.K.?
2008-08-29T19:32:00.000Z	Pici	DavidCanarias	Can you take a screenshot when it happens?
2008-08-29T19:32:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	Pici	do you mean Past?
2008-08-29T19:32:00.000Z	Pici	DavidCanarias	Can you upload it to some image sharing service?
2008-08-29T19:33:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	Pici	- how would I do that? I tried copy and paste, but it doesn't work
2008-08-29T19:34:00.000Z	Pici	DavidCanarias	Press the printscreen button on your keyboard, and then use something like imageshack to upload it
2008-08-29T19:36:00.000Z	Pici	DavidCanarias	Which part?
2008-08-29T19:37:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	Pici	I can go to file and then print, but after that ????
2008-08-29T19:37:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	Pici	don't know what you mean upload it - how to do it or where to put it?
2008-08-29T19:37:00.000Z	Pici	DavidCanarias	Not file and print.  Press the printscreen key on your keyboard, its usually next to F12
2008-08-29T19:38:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	Pici	my keyboard doesn't have a print screen button
2008-08-29T19:42:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	Pici	- arvind helped me find the screen shot so I can save. What do I do next please?
2008-08-29T19:46:00.000Z	Pici	DavidCanarias	Give it whatever name you want
2008-10-01T21:25:00.000Z	Pici	DavidCanarias	K3B should overwrite data on a dvd-rw when you go to write to it.
2008-10-01T21:27:00.000Z	Pici	DavidCanarias	Sure
2008-10-09T21:11:00.000Z	Pici	DavidCanarias	What do you mean by garbled?
2008-10-21T18:45:00.000Z	Pici	DavidCanarias	Try #videolan ? I'm not sure if thats what you want though.
2008-10-21T18:46:00.000Z	Pici	DavidCanarias	Its a trigger for ubottu, but that doesnt have any information you'd need.
2008-10-21T18:46:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	Pici	En videolan I can't find any manual.
