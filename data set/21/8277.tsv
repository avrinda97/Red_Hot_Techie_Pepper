2006-05-11T16:56:00.000Z	AlmtyBob		not going to be dictionaried or brute-forced anytime soon

2006-05-11T16:56:00.000Z	AlmtyBob		gotta write that down
2006-05-11T16:57:00.000Z	AlmtyBob		almost made me spit my soda out with 'secret'
2006-05-11T16:57:00.000Z	AlmtyBob		my boss's password is always his name plus an incrementing number
2006-05-11T16:58:00.000Z	AlmtyBob		oh, so any decent windows X clients?
2006-05-11T16:58:00.000Z	AlmtyBob		go for it
2006-05-11T16:59:00.000Z	AlmtyBob		8(
2006-05-11T16:59:00.000Z	dnkidjit	AlmtyBob	as in connecting to a remote X server from windows? I've used cygwin for that
2006-05-11T16:59:00.000Z	AlmtyBob		thanks, I'll look that up
2006-05-11T05:02:00.000Z	AlmtyBob	dnkidjit	I'm at cygwin's site and I'm a bit confused, is it as similar to remote desktop?
2006-05-11T05:02:00.000Z	AlmtyBob		or does it attempt to make windows seems like a linux OS?
2006-05-11T05:02:00.000Z	dnkidjit		not finals yet? i swear i am reading up on all the lectures at this point, not just the last one :\
2006-05-11T05:02:00.000Z	AlmtyBob		ok
2006-05-11T05:03:00.000Z	AlmtyBob		ah ok
2006-05-11T05:03:00.000Z	dnkidjit	AlmtyBob	it is a unix like environment for windows. as such it will run X as a client, allowing you to remotely connect to X running on some remote computer.. now that i think about it, i don't recommend it unless you enjoy a challenge
2006-05-11T05:03:00.000Z	AlmtyBob		I'm just looking for an easy way to manage a headless server from XP
2006-05-11T05:04:00.000Z	dnkidjit	AlmtyBob	if you just want to ssh into your server, try putty :)
2006-05-11T05:05:00.000Z	dnkidjit	AlmtyBob	yeah. its possible, but it involves getting X running under cygwin and then setting up a remote connection with it. it will involve reading a few howtos
