2007-10-05T10:44:00.000Z	jumbalia		Update.  I was able to install the NVIDIA drivers through console, but I still boot into a white screen after logging in.  Any ideas how to fix?
2007-10-05T10:45:00.000Z	jumbalia		Well hell nvm
2007-10-05T10:45:00.000Z	jumbalia		I got other problems
2007-10-05T10:46:00.000Z	jumbalia		ok, instead of a white screen, I get an error the the xserver found screens, but none were usable
2007-10-05T10:46:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	try dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-10-05T10:52:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	you may be able to get around that.
2007-10-05T10:54:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	your call
2007-10-05T10:56:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	couldn't say without seeing the logs
2007-10-05T10:59:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	that is crazyweird :0
2007-10-05T11:01:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	floopy error - are you booting of a floppy?if so, make another. if that fails, try another floppy drive
2007-10-05T11:02:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	in that case, weird. Does it kill the boot?
2007-10-05T11:02:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	then ignore it :)
2007-10-05T11:04:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	pretty easy, you just need to set up the repository for kubuntu
2007-10-05T11:07:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	Ibelieve so. that used to be the way many moons ago :)
2007-10-05T11:07:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	as for the second question, afaik, yes...
2007-10-05T11:27:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	if you're installing from scratch, maybe just wait. I dunno
2007-10-05T11:28:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	shouldn't matter really
2007-10-05T11:33:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	the fact that it says "gconfd" gives away the fact that it's not directly realted to xord
2007-10-05T11:35:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	maybe a live-cd would be the way to go
2007-10-05T11:45:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	I never bother. I might be important for a server, but it's overkill for a home system
2007-10-05T11:46:00.000Z	danielax	jumbalia	and if you create a separate home partitiou you can share home directories between cent/ubuntu
