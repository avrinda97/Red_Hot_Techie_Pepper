2005-03-11T16:58:00.000Z	TomAraya	johnnybezak	It can be a little frustrating to say the least.
2005-03-12T14:19:00.000Z	johnnybezak	TomAraya	the codecs have been updated, so the address is wrong
2005-03-12T14:20:00.000Z	johnnybezak	TomAraya	go to the mplayerhq homepage and download them manually

2005-03-12T15:04:00.000Z	TomAraya	johnnybezak	thanks, I'll try that.
2005-03-12T15:07:00.000Z	TomAraya	johnnybezak	I tried that.. it's been verifying the archive integrity for a while.... hmm now it's uncompressing.. will I need to anything with the chmod command at the end?
2005-03-12T15:08:00.000Z	johnnybezak	TomAraya	the chmod command makes it an "executable" the sh armyops will start the installer for you
2005-03-12T15:08:00.000Z	johnnybezak	TomAraya	just follow the prompts
2005-03-12T15:08:00.000Z	TomAraya	johnnybezak	good enough.
2005-03-12T15:08:00.000Z	johnnybezak	TomAraya	you are just running the installer aren't you?
2005-03-12T15:08:00.000Z	johnnybezak	TomAraya	you can make the actual program executable
2005-03-12T15:12:00.000Z	TomAraya	johnnybezak	is that typically how programs will be installed, downloading them and then sh ./filename?
2005-03-12T15:15:00.000Z	johnnybezak	TomAraya	when youre lucky thats how they install :)
2005-03-12T15:16:00.000Z	johnnybezak	TomAraya	typically when vendors want to package something to work on different distro's (like nvidia with their three d drivers) theyll package them like that
2005-03-12T15:16:00.000Z	johnnybezak	TomAraya	way better than installing from source anyway :)
2005-03-12T15:18:00.000Z	johnnybezak	TomAraya	is that what the installer said
