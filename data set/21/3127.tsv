2009-04-04T03:28:00.000Z	|PaperTiger|		I managed to delete my task bar, how do I get it back?
2009-04-04T03:28:00.000Z	XenoPhoenix	|PaperTiger|	you could remove your panel config, which will reset the panels back to default after you restart X
2009-04-04T03:29:00.000Z	|PaperTiger|	XenoPhoenix	how do I remove config?
2009-04-04T03:29:00.000Z	XenoPhoenix	|PaperTiger|	you can use: rm -r ~/.gconf/apps/panel
2009-04-04T03:30:00.000Z	|PaperTiger|	XenoPhoenix	then restart X (ctrl+alt+bkspc)?
2009-04-04T03:30:00.000Z	XenoPhoenix		yes
2009-04-04T03:32:00.000Z	|PaperTiger|	XenoPhoenix	will the CL be different if I'm on KDE?
2009-04-04T03:32:00.000Z	XenoPhoenix	|PaperTiger|	yeah, that will only work for gnome panel, not KDE, you'll have to wask someone else for KDE
2009-04-04T03:33:00.000Z	|PaperTiger|		Okay, thanks anyway, XenoPhoenix
2009-04-04T03:33:00.000Z	XenoPhoenix		heh not a problem
2009-04-04T03:34:00.000Z	|PaperTiger|	XenoPhoenix	what's the likelyhood of it working if I just restart X?
2009-04-04T03:35:00.000Z	XenoPhoenix	|PaperTiger|	It should take effect imediatly if you restart X, on GNOME That is
2009-04-04T03:36:00.000Z	XenoPhoenix		you should get the default 2 panels
2009-04-04T03:38:00.000Z	|PaperTiger|		Sorted :)
2009-04-04T03:38:00.000Z	|PaperTiger|		Not from X restart, but Widgets XD
2009-04-04T03:39:00.000Z	XenoPhoenix	|PaperTiger|	ah! well glad you solved it :)
2009-04-04T03:39:00.000Z	|PaperTiger|	XenoPhoenix	thanks. I'm getting used to Ubuntu now :)
2009-04-04T03:40:00.000Z	|PaperTiger|	XenoPhoenix	also trying to learn more about CLI too
2009-04-04T03:42:00.000Z	XenoPhoenix	|PaperTiger|	Always useful to know :), I'm fairly new myself
2009-04-04T03:43:00.000Z	|PaperTiger|	XenoPhoenix	I've moved from a Windows Dual-boot to a full Ubuntu install
2009-04-04T03:44:00.000Z	XenoPhoenix	|PaperTiger|	Yeah I've been using various distros on and off for a while but mainly windows, just switched to ubuntu main about 4 months ago though
