2008-08-03T18:03:00.000Z	eraldo		I need a labeling printer that works with Linux... any suggestions ?
2008-08-03T18:04:00.000Z	tim	eraldo	brother stuff will generally work, although they can be a bit annoying
2008-08-03T18:04:00.000Z	eraldo	tim	how can I make sure if it will work
2008-08-03T18:05:00.000Z	eraldo	tim	it is not listed in linuxfoundation's hcl
2008-08-03T18:06:00.000Z	tim	eraldo	go to brother's site, look for their drivers
2008-08-03T18:11:00.000Z	eraldo	tim	there is no information on their website concerning linux
2008-08-03T18:12:00.000Z	tim	eraldo	I'm just gonna go ahead and say you didn't look very hard :p
2008-08-03T18:17:00.000Z	tim	eraldo	:p
2008-08-03T18:17:00.000Z	tim	eraldo	brother's site has a linux section for every printer
2008-08-03T18:22:00.000Z	eraldo	tim	when I click on drivers I can only see windows drivers
2008-08-03T18:23:00.000Z	eraldo	tim	it looks to me as if only the QL printers have linux support but they are no desktop printers :/
2008-08-03T18:23:00.000Z	tim	eraldo	did you see the link I posted?
2008-08-03T18:23:00.000Z	tim	eraldo	are you looking for a label printer or a desktop printer?
2008-08-03T18:23:00.000Z	tim	eraldo	all of their lasers are already supported in ubuntu
2008-08-03T18:24:00.000Z	eraldo	tim	I was looking for something like the PT 2100...
2008-08-03T18:26:00.000Z	eraldo	tim	I don't have a huge budget for this... and buying a desktop version and one of thouse pc only would not only blow up the budget but would also be unproductive
2008-08-03T18:28:00.000Z	tim	eraldo	there's a ptouch driver that'll probably work with any of those, but if you need something with a keyboard, then I'm not sure what to tell you :p
2008-08-03T18:29:00.000Z	tim	eraldo	the ql-570 or whichever has a driver that I've used, it's not expensive
2008-08-03T18:29:00.000Z	tim	eraldo	if you aren't using with a pc though, what does ubuntu have to do with it?
2008-08-03T18:31:00.000Z	eraldo	tim	the pt 2100 is a desptop labeler (with a keyboard) that has USB connectivity
2008-08-03T18:32:00.000Z	eraldo	tim	the problem is that I could not find any information regarding its compatiblity with linux
