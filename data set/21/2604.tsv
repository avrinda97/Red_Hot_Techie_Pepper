2009-08-22T15:32:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r		Just extracted a large archive with the default manager and noticed that the cpu usage was constantly 25%, so i checked it out and it seems that its using 100% of one core at a time of my quad-core. Can i make the archiver use all 4 cores?
2009-08-22T15:34:00.000Z	groza	b3rz3rk3r	: why do you want to do that?
2009-08-22T15:34:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	groza	well im running a 10,000rpm raptor, so its not really maxing it out
2009-08-22T15:35:00.000Z	groza	b3rz3rk3r	: some programs have that in their options
2009-08-22T15:35:00.000Z	groza	b3rz3rk3r	: try a google
2009-08-22T15:54:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	groza	 j2daosh Found the solution. MT-write can be used in place of File Roller (which is default) and supports multiple threads.. archives scream now!

2009-08-22T18:58:00.000Z	groza	b3rz3rk3r	in ubuntu 8.04 worked
2009-08-22T18:59:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	groza	in theory yes. we just need to find some drivers that work for it. but lgitech doesnt make any, and i havent looked for others yet as i dont really use video much
