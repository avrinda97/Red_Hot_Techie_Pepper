2009-12-30T22:32:00.000Z	mka	bcool	it's 4.1GB used and 3.6GB free that adds up to 7.7GB which is 8GB if you calculate accurately
2009-12-30T22:33:00.000Z	mka	bcool	Sooorrry!!
2009-12-30T22:33:00.000Z	mka	bcool	yeah, I messed up
2009-12-30T22:35:00.000Z	mka	bcool	it shows your filesystem format as gphoto2 ??? whatever that is, can you see this drive being mounted if you type "df -h" ?
2009-12-30T22:38:00.000Z	mka	bcool	have you ever accessed your files in your device by nautilus?
