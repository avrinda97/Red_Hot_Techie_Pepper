2006-05-29T07:50:00.000Z	skippy		its just the way linux manages memory
2006-05-29T07:51:00.000Z	skippy		the kernel grabs more memory than is needed and distrobutes it :) it is perfectly normal
2006-05-29T07:51:00.000Z	skippy		and you want to install it?
2006-05-29T07:52:00.000Z	skippy		good
2006-05-29T07:53:00.000Z	skippy		at some point it is worth doing a bit of research on your hardware, and seeing if there is a more suitable graphics driver
2006-05-29T07:53:00.000Z	skippy		good to know its allright now gronk :)
2006-05-29T07:55:00.000Z	skippy		it is pretty well supported by the community which is a bonus
2006-05-29T07:55:00.000Z	skippy		well cello_rasp, you can download release candidtate 1
2006-05-29T07:56:00.000Z	skippy		on the 1st of june just run update and you will have a final version, cello :)
2006-05-29T07:56:00.000Z	skippy		debian seems to have become a bit quiet lately
2006-05-29T07:57:00.000Z	cello_rasp	skippy	debian is generally quite quiet. they trundle along though. that's the cost of a 100% rock solid stable distro
2006-05-29T07:57:00.000Z	skippy		well basically, my point is that when any new OS comes out you want to wait a little while to see if it gets hacked etc
2006-05-29T07:57:00.000Z	skippy		but dapper is the final product now really
2006-05-29T07:57:00.000Z	skippy		a RC very rarely changes much, the only changes to dapper will be superficial, little icons etc
2006-05-29T07:58:00.000Z	skippy		and chello_rasp i agree that debaian is a very solid distro
2006-05-29T07:58:00.000Z	cello_rasp		if dapper is the matureation of the current ubuntu "generation", then i can't wait to see how eft will work
2006-05-29T07:58:00.000Z	skippy		eft will be crazy
2006-05-29T07:58:00.000Z	skippy		:)
2006-05-29T07:58:00.000Z	skippy		what i want to know is what the hell is an eft? :D
2006-05-29T07:58:00.000Z	skippy	jrsims	what is your platform
2006-05-29T07:58:00.000Z	cello_rasp	skippy	i think its a baby newt
