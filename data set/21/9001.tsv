2007-09-18T13:14:00.000Z	FFighter		I've got a java app that gets ran through a sh script but everytime I try to run it, ubuntu asks me if I want to open the sh file, run in terminal or run
2007-09-18T13:15:00.000Z	dystopianray	FFighter	so select run
2007-09-18T13:15:00.000Z	FFighter	dystopianray	yeah, but isn't there a way to "remember" this setting?
2007-09-18T13:15:00.000Z	dystopianray	FFighter	make a shortcut to the script
2007-09-18T13:16:00.000Z	FFighter	dystopianray	a symlink?
2007-09-18T13:16:00.000Z	FFighter	dystopianray	I tried it but the same behaviour
2007-09-18T13:16:00.000Z	dystopianray	FFighter	gnome/kde can make shortcuts
2007-09-18T13:16:00.000Z	dystopianray	FFighter	a desktop or menu shortcut
2007-09-18T13:16:00.000Z	dystopianray	FFighter	in kde I can click on the desktop and go to 'create new -> link to application'
2007-09-18T13:17:00.000Z	FFighter	dystopianray	Tried it, it won't run
2007-09-18T13:18:00.000Z	dystopianray	FFighter	is there an error?
2007-09-18T13:18:00.000Z	FFighter	dystopianray	I created a launcher
2007-09-18T13:18:00.000Z	FFighter	dystopianray	no
2007-09-18T13:18:00.000Z	FFighter	dystopianray	It just fails silently
2007-09-18T13:18:00.000Z	dystopianray	FFighter	you must be doing it wrong
2007-09-18T13:18:00.000Z	FFighter	dystopianray	the path to the sh script is correct
2007-09-18T13:19:00.000Z	dystopianray	FFighter	is the working directory correct?
2007-09-18T13:19:00.000Z	FFighter	dystopianray	it only has a "command" field where I can put the command to run
2007-09-18T13:20:00.000Z	dystopianray	FFighter	hrrm, I don't know much about gnome so i'm not sure what else you can do
2007-09-18T13:22:00.000Z	FFighter	dystopianray	nevermind
2007-09-18T13:22:00.000Z	FFighter	dystopianray	thanks anyway
