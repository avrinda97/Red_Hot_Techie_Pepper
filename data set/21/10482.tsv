2005-09-22T16:46:00.000Z	mirak		hi there is a broken package in breezy, is that know problem ?
2005-09-22T16:47:00.000Z	onkarshinde	mirak	which one?
2005-09-22T16:48:00.000Z	onkarshinde	mirak	Is it a package from universe?
2005-09-22T16:49:00.000Z	mirak	onkarshinde	don't know
2005-09-22T16:49:00.000Z	mirak	onkarshinde	yes
2005-09-22T16:51:00.000Z	mirak	onkarshinde	I remove them
2005-10-09T06:30:00.000Z	onkarshinde	mirak	I don't think VNC sucks.
2005-10-09T06:31:00.000Z	mirak	onkarshinde	yes it does, it's slow as hell in comparison of a X remote session
2005-10-18T15:11:00.000Z	onkarshinde	mirak	Why do you want to use something you can't afford? Why don't want to use something you can afford for your lifetime?
2005-10-18T15:12:00.000Z	mirak	onkarshinde	that's why I said I think the default of Gnome is to not be like OS X enough :D
2005-10-18T15:12:00.000Z	mirak	onkarshinde	flaw/default
2005-10-18T15:13:00.000Z	onkarshinde	mirak	It is same as saying that windows is not like linux enough or vice-versa
2005-10-18T15:14:00.000Z	mirak	onkarshinde	no it's similar to saying KDE is to Windowish
2005-10-18T15:15:00.000Z	mirak	onkarshinde	that's not a secret that Gnome copies OS X
2005-10-18T15:16:00.000Z	onkarshinde	mirak	Gnome is earth and Aqua is water. none is copy of another.
2005-10-18T15:16:00.000Z	mirak	onkarshinde	isn't a Gnome like a kind of little troll ? :D
2005-10-18T15:18:00.000Z	onkarshinde	mirak	Try Places->Connect to server and mount a samba share.
2005-10-18T15:19:00.000Z	mirak	onkarshinde	hum, well it appears in the places location, but then I would like to be able to "save as" something in the samba folder directly. I am not sure it's possible without doing a real mount yet
2005-12-03T06:46:00.000Z	onkarshinde	mirak	I don't remember which one is for wht exactly, but one is for login shell config and other is not. For example opening terminal from desktop is not a login shell.
2005-12-03T06:46:00.000Z	mirak	onkarshinde	I added the path in /etc/profile ...
2005-12-03T06:47:00.000Z	onkarshinde	mirak	That will enable that particular path for all users
