2010-12-28T23:50:00.000Z	Vic10		How do I set ubuntu to autmatically mount an ntfs partition on login?
2010-12-28T23:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 add a proper entry to the /etc/fstab
2010-12-28T23:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 that command - mountes it once.. if you want a permenet mount. You add a proper entry in /etc/fstab.  the ntfs-3g wiki page gives examples.
2010-12-28T23:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 example from, my /etc/fstab -->  #UUID=6A62B9CC1192CB2D/media/VistaBootntfs-3gdefaults,locale=en_US.utf800
2010-12-28T23:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 example from, my /etc/fstab -->  UUID=6A62B9CC1192CB2D /media/VistaBoot ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.utf8 0 0
2010-12-28T23:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 gparted does not add entries to fstab.
2010-12-28T23:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 why?  you have read the docs mentioned and added a line to your fstab yet?
2010-12-28T23:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 you could perhaps install and run the 'ntfs-config' tool also. that might auto-add the proper entrys to fstab
2010-12-29T00:05:00.000Z	Vic10	Dr_Willis	is "mount point" where you want the icon for the location to be? or is that the actual location its going to be at?
2010-12-29T00:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 its the /media/WHATEVERMAKE_THIS_DIR_FIRST    location you want
2010-12-29T00:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 its not difficult.. i gave you an example line that would do it. (with some editing) OR as i suggested.. install and run the 'ntfs-config' tool
2010-12-29T00:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 example from, my /etc/fstab -->  UUID=6A62B9CC1192CB2D /media/VistaBoot ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.utf8 0 0
2010-12-29T00:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 use your uuid. make that VistaBoot Dir.. (or whatever dir you want) and there ya go.
2010-12-29T00:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 make a directory.. name it whatever you want..
2010-12-29T00:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 gnome handles the icon ont he desktop.. not fstab
2010-12-29T00:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 yes...
2010-12-29T00:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 /media/foldername is the full path you use..   Im not sure what you mean.. you access it the same as you would any other location/directory
2010-12-29T00:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 you are making this way too complex. :)
2010-12-29T00:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 Try it and see? - the answer is YES.. GNOME HANDLES THAT.. i said so earlier.
2010-12-29T00:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 not like its hard to use the PLACES menu item either...
2010-12-29T00:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vic10	 and that icon on the desktop wil actually go to /media/whatever
