2006-10-22T05:05:00.000Z	euly		Hi people. Do you know, how I can capture the sound that my soundcard plays? I tried "dd if=/dev/audio of=sound.raw" but it says the audio device is busy.

2006-10-22T05:17:00.000Z	euly	cherubiel	rawrec: could not open =/dev/audio for reading: No such file or directory
