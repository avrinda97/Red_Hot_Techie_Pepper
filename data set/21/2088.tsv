2010-01-23T20:44:00.000Z	g0th		anyone?
2010-01-23T20:44:00.000Z	joph	g0th	did you type in your password? :)
2010-01-23T20:45:00.000Z	g0th	joph	I did for thunderbird 3.0
2010-01-23T20:45:00.000Z	g0th	joph	then I simply removed tb 3.0 and installed tb 3.1
2010-01-23T20:48:00.000Z	g0th	joph	what do you mean?
2010-01-23T20:49:00.000Z	g0th	joph	what do I need to do?
2010-01-23T20:52:00.000Z	g0th	joph	where can I type the passwords?
2010-01-23T20:53:00.000Z	joph	g0th	you said you were using the previous version of tb, didn't you type in any passwords before?
2010-01-23T20:54:00.000Z	g0th	joph	yes in the previous version
2010-01-23T20:54:00.000Z	g0th	joph	and after having typed them in I can't type them in anymore
2010-01-23T20:54:00.000Z	g0th	joph	since the "master password service"/whatever  is dealing with it
2010-01-23T20:55:00.000Z	joph	g0th	ok i think you have to remove it completely
2010-01-23T20:55:00.000Z	g0th	joph	remove what?
2010-01-23T20:58:00.000Z	joph	g0th	remove tb
2010-01-23T21:01:00.000Z	joph	g0th	hope that works, if it doesn't you need to completely remove tb (incl. folder[s]) and reinstall it so that you're beginning from zero
2010-01-23T21:05:00.000Z	g0th	joph	that's not an option
2010-01-23T21:05:00.000Z	g0th	joph	I have like 100 folders with over 50'000 sorted mails/etc and several hundred rules
2010-01-23T21:05:00.000Z	joph	g0th	ah because you need the received mails huh?
