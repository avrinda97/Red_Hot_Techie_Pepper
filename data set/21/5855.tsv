2011-03-26T04:42:00.000Z	scott__		I was looking for a distro to install alongside ubuntu, just to try.  I'm kind of a n00b.  Does anybody have any suggestions?
2011-03-26T04:44:00.000Z	scott__		thanks Dr_Willis...I've been reading about several distros, and I've even tried openSuse.  Is Knoppix too advanced for a newcomer?  Or does it (and other distros) just require some tinkering to learn?
2011-03-26T04:44:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	I would say Ubuntu is really the best distro for a newcomer
2011-03-26T04:45:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	uhh, yeah I wouldn't bother, i would just use ubuntu
2011-03-26T04:45:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	even thinking about the idea of a "harder distro" is really missing the point almost entirely
2011-03-26T04:46:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	lots of newbies complain that FreeBSD is "hard" but then again most of them never take the time to read the amazingly well written and detailed FreeBSD handbook
2011-03-26T04:46:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	ignore iqpi
2011-03-26T04:47:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	actually no, not really
2011-03-26T04:48:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	you're wasting your time, honestly, trust me... do something more productive like learn to program
2011-03-26T04:48:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	there are indeed minor variations in how different distros organize things but overall linux is linux
2011-03-26T04:48:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	you're wasting your time even thinking about this stuff :)
2011-03-26T04:48:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	I second Dr_Willis' suggestion to learn bash, go /join #bash ... it will do you a world of good
2011-03-26T04:49:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	because at the end of the day, really, being an awesome sysadmin mainly comes down to automation, and on linux that mainly comes down to knowing how to write bash scripts
2011-03-26T04:49:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	everything else is software specific, not distro specific, learn about the specific software that you need, like apache or wahtever
2011-03-26T04:50:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	if you *really* wanna be masochistic, then it might not be a bad idea to learn the primary differences between debian and red hat
2011-03-26T04:51:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	but there's no real such thing as a "harder distro"
2011-03-26T04:51:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	most distros these days are based on either debian or red hat... Ubuntu being based on debian, Fedora and CentOS being based on red hat
2011-03-26T04:51:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	good, keep reading :)
2011-03-26T04:54:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	stick with learning C++ and add bash to your list of things to learn, also learn the gnu build system like using Makefiles
2011-03-26T04:56:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	yeah there's a crap load of different GUIs, GNOME and KDE to name but two amongst many others such as WindowMaker, XFCE, FVWM and fluxbox
2011-03-26T04:57:00.000Z	abstrakt	scott__	again, none of this changes on any of the other distros
