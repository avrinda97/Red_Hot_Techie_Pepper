2011-01-17T16:08:00.000Z	mrcan		how can i make my normal user to root user. i dont mean sudo su. i want close all asking passwords and i want access all folders without password
2011-01-17T16:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrcan	run:  sudo -i
2011-01-17T16:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrcan	why do you need access so much outside of $HOME, it's very rare toneed such access
2011-01-17T16:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrcan	you can run:  gksudo nautilus    do what you need, then close the file browser
2011-01-17T16:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrcan	not sure dude, considering the very small amount of times you will use it I wouldnt waste much effort on it
2011-01-17T16:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrcan	using that will just mean the commands wont ask for password and will cripple system security
2011-01-17T16:16:00.000Z	mrcan	ActionParsnip	i dont care system security i need it for my works
2011-01-17T16:16:00.000Z	mrcan	ActionParsnip	password makes me slow
2011-01-17T16:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrcan	be careful how you mess with that file, if you screw it up you will need to root recovery mode and undo your mess, basically its not worth it
2011-01-17T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrcan	yeah but anyone who has any sort of access even malicious javascript and flash anims will be able to do what they like, when they like
2011-01-17T16:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrcan	so an attacker can easily read your email and copy your firefox passwords to access your stored passwords
2011-01-17T16:18:00.000Z	mrcan	ActionParsnip	i understand your meaning but its not important for me, really! im not classic user dont worry about that
2011-01-17T16:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrcan	and copy yur email store if you have one and use your account
2011-01-17T16:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrcan	no, you clearly have no idea about what you are doing. Enjoy
2011-01-17T16:19:00.000Z	mrcan	ActionParsnip	ahahha =) nevermatter all about security
2011-01-17T16:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrcan	when you identity is stolen and your bank account suddenly empties, give me a knock ok
2011-01-17T16:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrcan	do you have a password on your email?
2011-01-17T16:22:00.000Z	mrcan	ActionParsnip	no :)
2011-01-17T16:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrcan	wow, youo really are a lost soul
2011-01-17T16:22:00.000Z	mrcan	ActionParsnip	you can say it over pm
2011-01-17T16:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrcan	i dunno what to say, i'm completely overwhelmed
