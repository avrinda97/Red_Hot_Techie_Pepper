2008-07-01T11:47:00.000Z	Gigs		Does anyone have skype audio working on 8.04?  If not then I might as well put 7.10 back on here.
2008-07-01T11:47:00.000Z	Slart	Gigs	works for me
2008-07-01T11:47:00.000Z	Gigs		I have spent about 6 hours on this pulseaudio mess now.
2008-07-01T11:47:00.000Z	Slart	Gigs	but it won't use pulseaudio iirc.. I just uses alsa
2008-07-01T11:47:00.000Z	Gigs	Slart	it's not getting along
2008-07-01T11:48:00.000Z	Slart	Gigs	no audio output ?
2008-07-01T11:48:00.000Z	Gigs	Slart	yeah pretty much no audio either way
2008-07-01T11:48:00.000Z	Gigs	Slart	I tried getting rid of pulseaudio completely, then it would use dmix for audio output, but audio input was broken
2008-07-01T11:49:00.000Z	Gigs		so I reinstalled pulseadio
2008-07-01T11:49:00.000Z	Slart	Gigs	you've trying changing things in options, sound devices?
2008-07-01T11:49:00.000Z	Gigs	Slart	yeah
2008-07-01T11:49:00.000Z	Gigs	Slart	trying to use only dmix broke tons of other apps
2008-07-01T11:50:00.000Z	Gigs		now that pulseaudio is reinstalled, everything else works other than skype
2008-07-01T11:50:00.000Z	Gigs		well, and second life also fails, because it also tries to use alsa directly
2008-07-01T11:50:00.000Z	Gigs		pulseaudio is grabbing alsa exclusively
2008-07-01T11:51:00.000Z	Slart	Gigs	hmm.. I don't think pulseaudio grabs alsa like that.. at least it doesn't do that for me..
2008-07-01T11:51:00.000Z	Gigs	Slart	well it started doing it for me since I uninstalled and reinstalled it
2008-07-01T11:51:00.000Z	Slart	Gigs	I just select the soundcard I want to use in the options dialog and that works
2008-07-01T11:52:00.000Z	Slart	Gigs	don't really know what to do about it.. I'm no good with troubleshooting alsa... perhaps someone else knows
2008-07-01T11:52:00.000Z	Slart		!ru | vlad
2008-07-01T11:52:00.000Z	Gigs	Slart	I really regret upgrading.
