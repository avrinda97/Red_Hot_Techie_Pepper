2011-02-14T00:45:00.000Z	soreau	optimus	Any interesting messages in /var/log/Xorg.0.log with regards to your input unit?
2011-02-14T00:52:00.000Z	optimus	soreau	: RADEON(0): SILKEN MOUSE enabled, hid 413c: 8121 type mouse
2011-02-14T00:53:00.000Z	soreau	optimus	Does it say anything about allowemptyinput enabled/disabled?
2011-02-14T00:54:00.000Z	optimus	soreau	negative
2011-02-14T00:54:00.000Z	soreau	optimus	Not sure then. What device is it as reported by lsusb? (assuming it's a usb device)
2011-02-14T00:58:00.000Z	optimus	soreau	lsusb :  Bus 002 Device 002: ID 413c:8121 Dell Computer Corp. Eastfold in HID thats pretty much my best guess
2011-02-14T00:59:00.000Z	soreau	optimus	That's your internal bluetooth adapter
2011-02-14T00:59:00.000Z	soreau	optimus	Is this mouse/keyboard a usb device?
2011-02-14T01:00:00.000Z	optimus	soreau	its a xps m2010 laptop the keyboard detaches from the actual pc and when it connects back its just to charge it. i dont think its a usb device
2011-02-14T01:01:00.000Z	optimus	soreau	sorry if this is trouble some :)
2011-02-14T01:02:00.000Z	soreau	optimus	Ah so it's wireless bluetooth device?
2011-02-14T01:04:00.000Z	optimus	soreau	yep thats exactly what it is you have to press the little button on the side of the pc and on the keyboard but when i sync the keyboard only the mouse enables
2011-02-14T01:06:00.000Z	soreau	optimus	I'm not too familiar with such a device and I'm willing to bet that less developers have this particular device.
2011-02-14T01:06:00.000Z	soreau	optimus	I would try to find someone with knowledge about bluetooth devices (someone like google :) )
2011-02-14T01:06:00.000Z	optimus	soreau	if it helps the device works with 9.04 when i upgraded it didnt work anymore.
2011-02-14T01:07:00.000Z	optimus	soreau	also google searched it and found no fixes for it :( spent 3 days looking
2011-02-14T01:07:00.000Z	soreau	optimus	Ok so now you know it works and has worked in the past. With that information, you can file a bug report
2011-02-14T01:08:00.000Z	optimus	soreau	where can i file a bug report?
2011-02-14T01:13:00.000Z	optimus	soreau	another thing is i note everything i do to my system and after i had upgraded from the previous versions i noticed that i had to install a new kernel. 2.6.30-9 worked keyboard and mouse. I upgraded to 2.6.32-29 and now its broke maybe i can degrade my kernel but if i do that grub2 refuses to work
2011-02-14T01:16:00.000Z	optimus	soreau	so basically im asking if it would be possible to install grub-legacy and some how get my kernel back to 2.6.30-9 would you know the steps to do that i think i would do a apt-get install grub-legacy and then switch out my repos and put in jaunty repos and do a apt-get update then apt-get install linux-kernel version older
