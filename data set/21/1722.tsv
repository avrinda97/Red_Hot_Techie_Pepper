2010-05-28T00:38:00.000Z	k-rad		anyone tried the new gnome shell on lucid ?  or know much of anything about it to know if its worth a install ?
2010-05-28T00:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	k-rad	gnome-shell is a little rough around the edges still, but it's "cool".  It's certainly not ready to replace Gnome, but neat to see.
2010-05-28T00:40:00.000Z	k-rad	ZykoticK9	functionally cool or hip cool ?
2010-05-28T00:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	k-rad	"hip cool" it's mainly just eye candy
2010-10-18T00:05:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	k-rad	10.10 != LTS
2010-11-06T06:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	k-rad	your question is really OT for this channel, but i don't have any recommendations on hosting or where to go for hosting suggestions.  best of luck though.
2010-11-12T03:32:00.000Z	k-rad	ZykoticK9	does conky % fork the process immediately to the background ?
2010-11-12T03:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	k-rad	add it to System / Preferences / Startup Applications
2010-11-12T03:30:00.000Z	k-rad	ZykoticK9	could you give me a one liner with a slight sleep command, i feel without a sleep command, minimal wait integer, thati'll really help me out
2010-11-12T03:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	k-rad	i don't have my conky/ubuntu theme setup right now so can't give you my example :(  - but just adding the appropriate conky run line to Startup Applications has always worked fine for me.
2010-11-12T03:33:00.000Z	k-rad	ZykoticK9	excuse me, conky &
2010-11-12T03:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	k-rad	don't use the % at the end (in the system / preferences / startup apps)
2010-11-12T03:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	k-rad	did you run update-grub after updating the file?
2010-12-16T01:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	k-rad	/var/cache/aprt/archives
2010-12-16T01:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	k-rad	/var/cache/apt/archives sorry typo
2010-12-20T23:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	k-rad	i highly doubt you can use AWN with gnome-shell.
2010-12-20T23:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	k-rad	i highly doubt you can use conky with gnome-shell.
2010-12-20T23:20:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	k-rad	i guess i was wrong...  thanks B45h_V|
2010-12-20T23:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	k-rad	don't get too used to gnome-shell, looks like it's being removed from 11.04 due to some bug/issue
2010-12-20T23:24:00.000Z	k-rad	ZykoticK9	i'm just feeling experimental.  the LTS will still be gnome
2010-12-20T23:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	k-rad	Gnome is being replaced by Unity in 11.04 (but there is still an option to use "classic"), but that's a separate issue from gnome-shell (personally i think gnome-shell is very cool, but still buggy)
