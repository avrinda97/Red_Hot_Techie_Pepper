2006-07-24T15:35:00.000Z	micahcowan		what siennalizard said.
2006-07-24T15:35:00.000Z	siennalizard	micahcowan	I think you're right, but there's clearly an underlying issue here.
2006-07-24T15:36:00.000Z	micahcowan	siennalizard	unless it was mounted manually after, say, an automount
2006-07-24T15:36:00.000Z	siennalizard	micahcowan	but it would be in the mtab, so mount shouldn't do it...
2006-07-24T15:36:00.000Z	micahcowan	siennalizard	current mount allows it, I believe... as a... "feature"?
2006-07-24T15:37:00.000Z	siennalizard	micahcowan	that's frightening.
2006-07-24T15:37:00.000Z	micahcowan	siennalizard	I could be wrong, but seem to remember that. I agree, it's really, really dumb.
2006-07-24T15:38:00.000Z	micahcowan	siennalizard	yeah, I just remounted /dev/hda1 (/) on /tmp/foo. (!)
2006-07-24T15:39:00.000Z	siennalizard	micahcowan	A highly desirable feature indeed!
2006-07-24T15:39:00.000Z	siennalizard	micahcowan	i expect one day they'll add "feature" that spots when you're trying to mount again, and silently simlink!
2006-07-24T15:40:00.000Z	micahcowan	siennalizard	now that I think about it, that's not the same problem, though: that's multiple mounts of same device on different dirs. I can't currently reproduce multiple mounts at same point...
2006-07-24T15:41:00.000Z	siennalizard	micahcowan	is that what you think the problem is? that's pretty severe!
2006-07-24T15:44:00.000Z	micahcowan	siennalizard	well, Rassmus89's message seemed to refer to /media/cdrom8 (8?!)
2006-07-24T15:45:00.000Z	micahcowan	siennalizard	anyway, I do remember some situation where / was multiply mounted. That may /not/ have been a "feature"...
2006-07-25T16:58:00.000Z	micahcowan	siennalizard	what's wrong with xmms?
2006-07-25T16:59:00.000Z	siennalizard	micahcowan	it uses OSS and is out of date, isn't it?
2006-07-25T16:59:00.000Z	micahcowan	siennalizard	it can use esd or alsa,just need to configure. out of date how?
2006-07-25T05:03:00.000Z	micahcowan	siennalizard	Petri_L: you shouldn't have to close xmms, it should "just work" after you save prefs
2006-07-25T05:04:00.000Z	siennalizard	micahcowan	thanks.
2006-07-25T05:11:00.000Z	siennalizard	micahcowan	yes he/she did and it was xmms
2006-07-25T05:11:00.000Z	micahcowan	siennalizard	well... then it should have worked, even in oss-mode, shouldn't it have?
