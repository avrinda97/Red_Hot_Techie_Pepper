2007-09-08T12:13:00.000Z	Flannel	LukeEkblad	tar.gz is just a compression/etc type, there are a number of different ways to install one, based on whats inside of it.  This is a probable method htoug

2007-09-08T12:16:00.000Z	Flannel	LukeEkblad	Theres steps on that page.  First put your USB in, then run `./swapboost.sh -n` and that's it.
