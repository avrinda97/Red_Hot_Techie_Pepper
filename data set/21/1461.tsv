2010-09-10T12:53:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila		Hey, anyone know how to make standalone programs?
2010-09-10T12:53:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila		like that and with .i386 or .x86_64?
2010-09-10T12:54:00.000Z	Doyle	JohnHeikkila	what kind of program?
2010-09-10T12:55:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Doyle	I was thinking about a program which would be like a front-end for Flasm
2010-09-10T12:56:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Doyle	But now that I think about it, it can be an installable one, too
2010-09-10T13:03:00.000Z	Doyle	JohnHeikkila	are you a programmer?
2010-09-10T13:03:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Doyle	Not really, but I've just coded a lot
2010-09-10T13:04:00.000Z	Doyle	JohnHeikkila	every os in the world can read it. Encorporate backend languages and you can build web-apps
2010-09-10T13:04:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Doyle	Yes but if I want to kinda make a front-end for Flasm?
2010-09-10T13:05:00.000Z	Doyle	JohnHeikkila	there's no 'one' language for multi-platform applications... you could learn a few C languages, that's as close as youre going to get
2010-09-10T13:07:00.000Z	Doyle	JohnHeikkila	if you're going to write a front end for flasm... it'd be best to write specifically for each OS you want to deploy the app on
2010-09-10T13:10:00.000Z	Doyle	JohnHeikkila	I'd have to say Python would suit your needs best
2010-09-10T13:10:00.000Z	Doyle	JohnHeikkila	it's licensing will be suitable for your situation I think considering your using Flasm
2010-09-10T13:10:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Doyle	Okay, good
2010-09-10T13:11:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Doyle	But th
2010-09-10T13:11:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Doyle	But the problem with Python is that I've never used it :(
2010-09-10T13:13:00.000Z	Doyle	JohnHeikkila	learn it... You've messed around with programming so you should understand enough to dive in relatively quickly
2010-09-10T13:27:00.000Z	Doyle	JohnHeikkila	give up on writing one app for multiple platforms, I don't htink you're at that level
2010-09-10T13:30:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Doyle	What about only for linux?
2010-09-10T13:31:00.000Z	Doyle	JohnHeikkila	Language choice is all up to personal preference. If you know a language already try doing using it, if not, learn Python
2010-09-10T13:34:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	Doyle	Okay, thank you.
