2009-02-03T07:50:00.000Z	linux_guy		how do add a line to your sources.list file?
2009-02-03T07:50:00.000Z	Titan8990	linux_guy	you can use    echo 'STUFF I AM ADDING HERE' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-02-03T07:50:00.000Z	Titan8990	linux_guy	or open in your favorite text editor
2009-02-03T07:53:00.000Z	Titan8990	linux_guy	looks like you need a binary called gbx
2009-02-03T07:54:00.000Z	Titan8990	linux_guy	does this command return anything:      which gbx
2009-02-03T07:55:00.000Z	linux_guy	Titan8990	no
2009-02-03T07:55:00.000Z	Titan8990	linux_guy	search the repositories for xgb, its going to be a language interpretter of some kind
2009-02-03T07:57:00.000Z	linux_guy	Titan8990	i can't find xgb in synaptic
2009-02-03T07:57:00.000Z	linux_guy	Titan8990	could it be in apt-get?
2009-02-03T07:57:00.000Z	Titan8990	linux_guy	apt-get and synaptic is the same thing
2009-02-03T07:58:00.000Z	linux_guy	Titan8990	ok thanks.  now what?
2009-02-03T07:59:00.000Z	Titan8990	linux_guy	I am really unsure because I am unfamilur with the program that you are trying to use, as well as the interpretter that it needs
2009-02-03T09:07:00.000Z	Titan8990	linux_guy	did you install it from source?
2009-02-05T19:41:00.000Z	Titan8990	linux_guy	it doesn't show up in fdisk -l??
2009-02-05T19:41:00.000Z	linux_guy	Titan8990	nosir
2009-02-05T19:41:00.000Z	Titan8990	linux_guy	what about lsusb?
2009-02-05T19:42:00.000Z	Titan8990	linux_guy	if it doesn't show in windows either then you have other problems....
2009-02-05T19:43:00.000Z	linux_guy	Titan8990	i got an old computer for linux testing purposes.  i installed ubuntu last night which was a pig.  only because of 199mb ram hahaha.  anyway, i started to reformat and install xubuntu.  the install froze up at 15% for hours.  so i restarted and now i have nothing
2009-02-05T19:44:00.000Z	linux_guy	Titan8990	the plan was to pull the hdd out, connect to linux machine (or windows) via usb cable and format the drive... try again
2009-02-05T19:44:00.000Z	linux_guy	Titan8990	nothing recognizes the drive
2009-02-05T19:47:00.000Z	linux_guy	Titan8990	Dr_willis, http://paste.ubuntu.com/114052/
