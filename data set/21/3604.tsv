2009-10-14T13:13:00.000Z	Neurolysis		Hey guys, getting a really weird thing with the latest 9.04... I have just burnt the iso to a CD, and it booted fine, I managed to get through the bit where you choose the language fine, but when I go to press enter on /any/ of the options (like 'install ubuntu, check disk for defects), nothing happens at all. Any ideas?
2009-10-14T13:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neurolysis	did you run the CD verifier? Did you MD5 check the ISO?
2009-10-14T13:14:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ActionParsnip	both.
2009-10-14T13:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neurolysis	did you burn the CD very SLOWLY?
2009-10-14T13:14:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ActionParsnip	yes. 2x.
2009-10-14T13:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neurolysis	good
2009-10-14T13:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neurolysis	try setting bios to failsafe defualts as well as disable uneeded hardware like usb, sound and lan (if you can)
2009-10-14T13:16:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ActionParsnip	got nothing else in. will try failsafe on bios.
2009-10-14T13:19:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ActionParsnip	still not working. weird thing is as i say, it still lets me get past the language selection by pressing enter :\
2009-10-14T13:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neurolysis	got a usb stick you can install from, that may be better
2009-10-14T13:20:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ActionParsnip	that was my original plan, BIOS doesn't support USB boot
2009-10-14T13:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neurolysis	got a FDD?
2009-10-14T13:21:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ActionParsnip	only an external using USB. BIOS doesn't seem to like USB full stop
2009-10-14T13:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neurolysis	you can boot a special floppy to then kick off a usb stick
2009-10-14T13:24:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ActionParsnip	if you mean like a 98 bootdisk, i tried that, but it seems it doesn't recognise any other drive than it's own
2009-10-14T13:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neurolysis	yes like a 98 bootdisk, but not an ACTUAL 98 boot disk
2009-10-14T13:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neurolysis	http://www.pendrivelinux.com/use-a-floppy-to-boot-usb-pendrive-linux/
2009-10-14T13:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Neurolysis	microsoft stuff is very rigid in config so achieves very little. Linux is very flexible so can do more than nothing (which is a bit more than windows does)
2009-10-14T13:27:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ActionParsnip	I'll give that a shot. Weird thing is mind, it does display 'USB-ZIP' at the boot options as an option when I insert the pendrive, but it simply goes on to try and boot from the HDD regardless of if i select it
2009-10-14T13:29:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ActionParsnip	i've just realised, text mode interface is working
2009-10-14T13:44:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ActionParsnip	it may just be me, but i figure it isn't your intention so i should tell you anyway. when you do the mid sentence shouting, it comes across as elitist condescension. as i say, i don't think that was your intention, so i figured i should tell you.
