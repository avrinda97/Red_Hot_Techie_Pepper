2009-10-11T14:14:00.000Z	seemawn		does anyone know how to force apt re-downloading a package which seems to be correct downloaded/installed and in the latest version and so on?
2009-10-11T14:15:00.000Z	bazhang	seemawn	which package, what version of ubuntu; paste.ubuntu.com with the errors when you try to remove it
2009-10-11T14:17:00.000Z	bazhang	seemawn	karmic?
2009-10-11T14:18:00.000Z	bazhang	seemawn	what version of ubuntu and paste.ubuntu.com with the errors
2009-10-11T14:18:00.000Z	seemawn	bazhang	hold on
2009-10-11T14:21:00.000Z	bazhang	seemawn	why would you possibly try to remove wget
2009-10-11T14:22:00.000Z	seemawn	bazhang	it remains unconfigured and messes up my package-database
2009-10-11T14:25:00.000Z	bazhang	seemawn	you are running jaunty? have you added some 3rd party repos to get your system in such a bind
2009-10-11T14:26:00.000Z	bazhang	seemawn	please paste.ubuntu.com with your sources.list
2009-10-11T14:27:00.000Z	seemawn	bazhang	hold on
2009-10-11T14:30:00.000Z	seemawn	bazhang	http://paste.ubuntu.com/290725/
2009-10-11T14:32:00.000Z	bazhang	seemawn	what is the final repo? le-web.org and why are you using root and dpkg to remove packages and not apt-get with sudo
2009-10-11T14:33:00.000Z	seemawn	bazhang	i have been using linux for years, and I am used to a root-account avaiable. It is a mess when a user can commit admin-tasks with his own pw.
2009-10-11T14:34:00.000Z	bazhang	seemawn	how old is this install
2009-10-11T14:35:00.000Z	seemawn	bazhang	what do you mean? This is up-to-date, and this install is half a year afair
2009-10-11T14:36:00.000Z	bazhang	seemawn	when did this wget issue surface? that is an important package and worrisome that you would need to reinstall it
2009-10-11T14:37:00.000Z	bazhang	seemawn	any recollection of what led to it? aha
2009-10-11T14:37:00.000Z	seemawn	bazhang	sorry, I dont remember.
2009-10-11T14:39:00.000Z	seemawn	bazhang	not completely installed
2009-10-11T14:40:00.000Z	bazhang	seemawn	not sure what to advise here, normally it would be sudo dpkg --configure -a
2009-10-11T14:44:00.000Z	bazhang	seemawn	what about installing new packages ie not the 3 problem ones
