2010-05-09T12:11:00.000Z	obiwan_		boys could anybody help me troubleshoot the problem with my evolution mail account with gmail?
2010-05-09T12:11:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	Shure, post your question.
2010-05-09T12:12:00.000Z	obiwan_	gentookitty	good to know a gentoo kitty , so qt :) . problem is it won't talk to the server it says it couldn't. i tried with pop either and didn't work
2010-05-09T12:13:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 So let's get  back to the start line- I'm not an experienced user but I will try my best to help you. Did you enabled your gmail account to be able to use pop/imap?
2010-05-09T12:14:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 You go to Settings>Forwarding and pop/imap.
2010-05-09T12:15:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 So by this answer I understand that you did that already, yes? Enable pop/imap
2010-05-09T12:16:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 Maybe that link would help you. Try deleting your account from evolution then configure it again.
2010-05-09T12:16:00.000Z	obiwan_	gentookitty	do you know if they changed some policy respecting ports or something from karmic to lucid?
2010-05-09T12:17:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 just a second, I will try to see know if my evolution works.
2010-05-09T12:17:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 I don't think they would do such a thing, they are not Yahoo:)
2010-05-09T12:17:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 One second to see if my evolution works with gmail.
2010-05-09T12:18:00.000Z	obiwan_	gentookitty	do you say that because the last minute yahoo to google switch in lucid? i don't know anything bout that. it was a surprise to see good ol google in lucid too hehe
2010-05-09T12:19:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 I'm saying yahoo because of problems with yahoo mesenger protocol and 3rd party apps.
2010-05-09T12:20:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 Here, evolution works fine on 10.04 amd 64 ubuntu version.
2010-05-09T12:21:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 Have you tried deleting the account and trying again?
2010-05-09T12:22:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 Try that know and see if it works. Please be attentive when you write your password and all the things in evolution. You could have done a  typo and that's why it can sometimes not work.
2010-05-09T12:22:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 Also when not working, what errors, messages do you get?
2010-05-09T12:23:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 Works now?
2010-05-09T12:24:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 So I think you typed wrong the password so that's why you failed to connect or other info...
2010-05-09T12:25:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 Glad it works now!
2010-05-09T12:27:00.000Z	gentookitty	obiwan_	 I see...
