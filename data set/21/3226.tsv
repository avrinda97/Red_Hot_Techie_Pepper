2009-02-26T02:23:00.000Z	jaymes0		is there a way to make the desktop installer 'ignore' all disks in a system bar the one selected for install?
2009-02-26T02:23:00.000Z	Titan8990	jaymes0	easiest way would be to just unplug them
2009-02-26T02:24:00.000Z	Titan8990	jaymes0	but the installer won't install on drives that you don't tell it to
2009-02-26T02:24:00.000Z	jaymes0	Titan8990	I just tried an install, and it put grub on a different disk than the os was installed to
2009-02-26T02:24:00.000Z	jaymes0		and 'broke' a raid 0
2009-02-26T02:25:00.000Z	Titan8990	jaymes0	are you aware that raid0 is slower and less fault tolerent then two single disks?
2009-02-26T02:26:00.000Z	jaymes0		it's just a fakeraid thing on an ich9 controller, and yes im aware about the tollerence and marginal speed differences :)
2009-02-26T02:26:00.000Z	Titan8990	jaymes0	anyways, does the installer recognize your raid0 or is it displaying both disks seperatly? softraid, fakeraid, or hardraid?
2009-02-26T02:26:00.000Z	jaymes0		its displaying the raid0 disks seperately
2009-02-26T02:26:00.000Z	jaymes0		and im installing on a different, non raided disk that is connected to the same ich9 controller
2009-02-26T02:27:00.000Z	Titan8990	jaymes0	I would just manually install grub then
2009-02-26T02:27:00.000Z	Titan8990		!grub | jaymes0
2009-02-26T02:27:00.000Z	Titan8990	jaymes0	that is, if thats all that its missing
2009-02-26T02:27:00.000Z	jaymes0		can i stop grub from being installed on the desktop installer?
2009-02-26T02:27:00.000Z	Titan8990	jaymes0	no
2009-02-26T02:27:00.000Z	Titan8990	jaymes0	not even on the alternate installer
2009-02-26T02:28:00.000Z	jaymes0		it's missing yes, but my issue is that it installs on a different (and raided...) disk, breaking it
2009-02-26T02:28:00.000Z	Titan8990	jaymes0	alright, but you already installed everything but grub on the intended disk, correct?
2009-02-26T02:28:00.000Z	jaymes0		yeah
2009-02-26T02:29:00.000Z	Titan8990	jaymes0	alright, so install grub, in the future, unplug your raided drives during installation
2009-02-26T02:29:00.000Z	Titan8990	jaymes0	or prior to installation I should say
