2007-11-17T09:30:00.000Z	nickrud	kontol	we see,
2007-11-17T09:31:00.000Z	nickrud	kontol	usually people don't answer unless they know
2007-11-17T09:31:00.000Z	kontol		matt_j: not that one.. thats the old version
2007-11-17T09:31:00.000Z	nickrud	kontol	for .8.12 you'd probably need to compile it (see I did see your question :)
2007-11-17T09:32:00.000Z	kontol	nickrud	I did that but my scripts don't work even though perl is loaded
2007-11-17T09:32:00.000Z	nickrud	kontol	I don't use irssi, which is why I passed on the question.
2007-11-17T09:32:00.000Z	kontol		:(((((
2007-11-17T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud	kontol	you should ask either on the forums, or on the ubuntu-user mail list. Some smart people on the mail list
2007-11-17T09:33:00.000Z	kontol		pici.. it has some bug fixes
2007-11-17T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud		!nohelp
2007-11-17T09:34:00.000Z	nickrud	kontol	out of curiosity, when you did the configure, did it say it was enabling perl ?
2007-11-17T09:34:00.000Z	kontol	nickrud	yeah it did
