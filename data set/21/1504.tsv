2010-08-17T04:05:00.000Z	cesc_xubuntu		I need help with my usb wireless adapter on xubuntu. It's an Alfa Network AWUS036H that I use with no problems on another machine with ubuntu 10.04. But on my xubuntu 10.04 it's not working. Any ideas?

2010-08-17T04:18:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	cesc_xubuntu	looks like it's working fine, what network manager are you using? NM or Wicd?
2010-08-17T04:19:00.000Z	cesc_xubuntu	ilovefairuz	how do I know this?
2010-08-17T04:21:00.000Z	cesc_xubuntu	ilovefairuz	I have on top right corner NetworkManager  Applet 0.8 . I'm wired connected to the internet, my usb wireless connected to usb port as well.
2010-08-17T04:22:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	cesc_xubuntu	what you click on it, you don't see a list of available wireless networks?
2010-08-17T04:25:00.000Z	cesc_xubuntu	ilovefairuz	yes I can see some now. Does that means it's fully working ? Because before I disconnected the wired internet connection, went to the terminal window, typed iwconfig and wlan0 was like this...
2010-08-17T04:26:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	cesc_xubuntu	that means it's not connected to any wireless access points/networks, that's normal, it takes time to scan networks
2010-08-17T04:26:00.000Z	cesc_xubuntu	ilovefairuz	then I tried to put the wireless adapter in mode monitor entering iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor and I got an error
2010-08-17T04:27:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	cesc_xubuntu	you don't need to do this at all for it to scan networks, monitor mode reduces the functionality of the card to ONLY monitor wireless packets, won't connect to any networks
2010-08-17T04:34:00.000Z	cesc_xubuntu	ilovefairuz	I'm going to unplug my wired connection... coming back in a few minutes. Thanks..
2010-08-17T04:43:00.000Z	cesc_xubuntu	ilovefairuz	I'm already connected wirelessly.
2010-08-17T04:43:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	cesc_xubuntu	so all worked then? that's good
2010-08-17T05:11:00.000Z	cesc_xubuntu	ilovefairuz	yes thanks for your help.
2010-08-17T05:13:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	cesc_xubuntu	you're welcome
2010-08-17T05:53:00.000Z	cesc_xubuntu	ilovefairuz	are you still there?
2010-08-17T05:53:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	cesc_xubuntu	yeap, checking, wait
2010-08-17T05:54:00.000Z	cesc_xubuntu	ilovefairuz	ok no problem
