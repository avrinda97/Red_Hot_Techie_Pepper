2009-11-25T00:02:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Drunkpunk1	make a backup text file and copy it to your gmail acct google docs , just to be safe
2009-11-25T00:03:00.000Z	Drunkpunk1		 BluesKaj: ok will try that but how do i reinstall the backup if all i've got is the commandline to work from?
2009-11-25T00:04:00.000Z	Drunkpunk1		 BluesKaj: : i mean reinstate
2009-11-25T00:06:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Drunkpunk1	in the cli you would do: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
