2010-10-24T00:52:00.000Z	robin0800	zico	well hitting shift at boot time should allow you to select the recover console and use that
2010-10-24T01:13:00.000Z	zico	robin0800	its still not working...how do i get the passwrd to update/install new software?!?!?!?
2010-10-24T01:22:00.000Z	robin0800	zico	you have been told there isn't one
2010-10-24T01:24:00.000Z	robin0800	zico	I find that hard to believe if you used that password to log in
