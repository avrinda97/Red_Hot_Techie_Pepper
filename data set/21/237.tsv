2012-09-26T06:33:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy		Is there a channel where I can ask Unity related questions? Still having problems with Chrome tabs
2012-09-26T06:34:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy		Imma give up on Unity. It can't manage tabs =/
2012-09-26T06:34:00.000Z	Snowie	DeltaHeavy	hang on a sec. let me test.
2012-09-26T06:36:00.000Z	Snowie	DeltaHeavy	ah, i see. When you drag them over the dock, focus wont switch. and even if there side by side, you can seperate, but not reattach. hmmmm..... anyone?
2012-09-26T06:36:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Snowie	Exactly what's happening here.
2012-09-26T06:37:00.000Z	Snowie	DeltaHeavy	it's broken. I've never had need to do it, so Ive never noticed it before. I guess i just dont browse that way
2012-09-26T06:38:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Snowie	I'm a web dev and often have many tabs open anyway. I make use of this feature a lot.
2012-09-26T06:38:00.000Z	Snowie	DeltaHeavy	someone smarter than me may be able to tell you if it's unity or chrome that you should report to, or if there is a fix, but i think its just usability
2012-09-26T06:39:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Snowie	It's the same package they shove out for ever Ubuntu DE. Pretty sure it's Unity.
2012-09-26T06:40:00.000Z	Snowie	DeltaHeavy	you could make your case to the unity devs
2012-09-26T06:40:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Snowie	Is there a place I can report to them?
2012-09-26T06:40:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Snowie	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-2d/+bug/935713
2012-09-26T06:41:00.000Z	Snowie	DeltaHeavy	have you tried unity 3d then? that bug seems very specific
2012-09-26T06:42:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Snowie	I'm not sure what that is. I'm on a VM so idk if I can use 3D stuff.
2012-09-26T06:43:00.000Z	Snowie	DeltaHeavy	think it depends on you VM. when you login to ubuntu, you should see options for desktop. if 3d's not there, then you need to talk to the admins.
2012-09-26T06:45:00.000Z	Snowie	DeltaHeavy	np mate. i should point out im a fan of Unity, so i just want you to enjoy the same shortcuts i enjoy
2012-09-26T06:46:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Snowie	Thanks for the help! By any chance do you know how to speed up Unity? There seems to be a terrible delay on everything I do. In other DE's, like GNOME 2/3, KDE, XFCE it's responsive but this doesn't feel responsive at all.
2012-09-26T06:47:00.000Z	Snowie	DeltaHeavy	this is why i say im a fan and not a fanboi, because the answer, as far as i can tell, is development time
2012-09-26T06:48:00.000Z	Snowie	DeltaHeavy	i get delays too :(
2012-09-26T06:48:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	Snowie	Yeah, I hope it improves. Right now I'm not sure if it's ready for my tastes, or if these problems I dislike will ever go away.
2012-09-26T06:49:00.000Z	Snowie	DeltaHeavy	yeah, which is why i try. more users == more developers
