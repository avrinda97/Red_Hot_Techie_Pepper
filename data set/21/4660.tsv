2010-10-10T04:24:00.000Z	pradeep_		i think his statement was direct
2010-10-10T04:24:00.000Z	pradeep_		lol
2010-10-10T04:24:00.000Z	pradeep_		lets get back to linux ubuntu
2010-10-10T04:25:00.000Z	izinucs	pradeep_	yep
2010-10-10T04:28:00.000Z	izinucs	pradeep_	I like kubuntu
2010-10-10T04:39:00.000Z	izinucs	pradeep_	you trying to get it to work?  is it usb?
2010-10-10T04:39:00.000Z	pradeep_	izinucs	yes
2010-10-10T04:40:00.000Z	izinucs	pradeep_	after plugging it in go to a terminal and type "dmesg" (no quotes).. at the end will show the modem being recognized and most likely give you the mount point for it.
2010-10-10T04:41:00.000Z	izinucs	pradeep_	ah.. not an old fashioned dialup modem?
2010-10-10T04:41:00.000Z	izinucs	pradeep_	still dmesg should give you the mount point for the usb device despite what it is.
2010-10-10T04:45:00.000Z	pradeep_	izinucs	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/xFfJdNmA that is the output there
2010-10-10T04:48:00.000Z	izinucs	pradeep_	did you boot with it plugged in?
2010-10-10T04:48:00.000Z	pradeep_	izinucs	no
2010-10-10T04:49:00.000Z	izinucs	pradeep_	dmesg reports the last thing mounted was an iso of something.. I'll look deeper
2010-10-10T04:50:00.000Z	izinucs	pradeep_	ehci_hcd is the mount point of the gsm modem
2010-10-10T04:51:00.000Z	izinucs	pradeep_	or ttyUSB0
2010-10-10T04:51:00.000Z	izinucs	pradeep_	also ttyUSB1
2010-10-10T04:51:00.000Z	pradeep_	izinucs	yes i think from my wvdial
2010-10-10T04:51:00.000Z	izinucs	pradeep_	I think the ehci_hcd is the phone acting like a mass storage device
2010-10-10T04:52:00.000Z	pradeep_	izinucs	yea
2010-10-10T04:57:00.000Z	pradeep_	izinucs	thanks ttyl
