2010-03-10T23:25:00.000Z	Guest45508		Hello, after upgrading to karmic i have a problem with my wireless card (Atheros AR5001 - on an acer aspire one). After leaving the computer for some time without doing anything the card becomes unclaimed and i can make it work again only after a hard reboot. ANY IDEAS???
2010-03-10T23:26:00.000Z	nperry	Guest45508	Weird, I've got the exact same card and hasn't happened to me
2010-03-10T23:28:00.000Z	Guest45508	nperry	and i get the same problem both with network manager and wicd installed
2010-03-10T23:29:00.000Z	nperry	Guest45508	Have you looked through dmesg, any idea there?
2010-03-10T23:29:00.000Z	nperry	Guest45508	Best for you to pastebin whats in /var/log/dmesg
2010-03-10T23:31:00.000Z	Guest45508	nperry	no haven't looked that yet i'll have to wait for the problem to happen so i can see the dmesg
2010-03-10T23:32:00.000Z	nperry	Guest45508	You might have /var/log/dmesg.0 which would be from a previous session
2010-03-10T23:35:00.000Z	Guest45508	nperry	yeap i found it
2010-03-10T23:37:00.000Z	nperry	Guest45508	Good, pastebin, I'll have a look at it..
2010-03-10T23:39:00.000Z	Guest45508	nperry	http://paste.ubuntu.com/392691/ here it is
2010-03-10T23:42:00.000Z	nperry	Guest45508	Nothing bad happened there, Not to sure if it would be caught by dmesg, Have you got anymore dmesg that you could paste bin?
2010-03-10T23:44:00.000Z	Guest45508	nperry	http://paste.ubuntu.com/392697/
2010-03-10T23:45:00.000Z	Guest45508	nperry	http://paste.ubuntu.com/392699/ another
2010-03-10T23:46:00.000Z	nperry	Guest45508	Nope nothing there either, If you have a look at the dmesg, you'll see a number within the brackets. If something happens the numbers would jump from ~20-30 to whenever it happens as thats only boot
2010-03-10T23:48:00.000Z	Guest45508	nperry	http://paste.ubuntu.com/392700/ one more
2010-03-10T23:49:00.000Z	Guest45508	nperry	http://paste.ubuntu.com/392701/ that's the last one i have
2010-03-10T23:50:00.000Z	nperry	Guest45508	Not to sure if pastbin is cutting the file short, but they just contain normal boot up which seems fine
2010-03-10T23:52:00.000Z	Guest45508	nperry	no i think its all there
2010-03-10T23:54:00.000Z	Guest45508	nperry	is there a way to reclaim the card without a hard reboot?
2010-03-10T23:56:00.000Z	nperry	Guest45508	First of all we need to find where the card is dropping to.
2010-03-10T23:58:00.000Z	Guest45508	nperry	i think it has to do with inactivity of the computer, cause the problem comes always after leaving it on but doing nothing on it for some time
