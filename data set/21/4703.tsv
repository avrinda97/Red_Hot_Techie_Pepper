2008-03-27T03:51:00.000Z	cpurn	soundray	thanks
2008-03-27T03:52:00.000Z	cpurn	soundray	bot dead?
2008-03-27T03:53:00.000Z	soundray	cpurn	it's not responding to info requests for some reason. Anyway, the current tzdata package has version number 2008a-0ubuntu0.7.10
2008-03-27T03:56:00.000Z	cpurn	soundray	ah sorry, I missed your reply!
2008-03-27T03:57:00.000Z	cpurn	soundray	sorry, is tzdata a package?
2008-03-27T03:57:00.000Z	soundray	cpurn	yes
2008-03-27T03:58:00.000Z	cpurn	soundray	ok, will check thanks.
2008-03-27T04:11:00.000Z	cpurn	soundray	I'm kind of hitting a brick wall here with no luck finding tzdata in dapper, I have universe and multiuniverse in my sources.list?
2008-03-27T04:12:00.000Z	soundray	cpurn	dapper is different
2008-03-27T04:12:00.000Z	cpurn	soundray	does that mean I have to install it manually without package?
2008-03-27T04:13:00.000Z	soundray	cpurn	no
2008-03-27T04:13:00.000Z	soundray	cpurn	I think the timezone data is part of libc6 in dapper
2008-03-27T04:13:00.000Z	cpurn	soundray	I'm trying to stick with the packages as much as I can... would you be able to share some lights on how I can get tzdata? google hasn't been helpful.
2008-03-27T04:13:00.000Z	cpurn	soundray	I see
2008-03-27T04:14:00.000Z	cpurn	soundray	thanks, I'll check it out... that's a good hint
2008-03-27T04:14:00.000Z	soundray	cpurn	to confirm, you could look at the libc6 changelog and see if it contains timezone data related entries
2008-03-27T04:15:00.000Z	cpurn	soundray	yup... I'll try kick the libc6 upgrade on my test box.. :)
2008-03-27T04:34:00.000Z	cpurn	soundray	I can't find them in the changelog, but you seem to be right on the ball... all system that has 2.3.6-0ubuntu20.5 installed seem to have the right timezone data DST for 2008
2008-03-27T04:37:00.000Z	soundray	cpurn	nothing in /usr/share/doc/libc6/changelog.gz ?
2008-03-27T04:37:00.000Z	soundray	cpurn	or zgrep -i timezone /usr/share/doc/libc6/*
