2009-07-18T04:02:00.000Z	jvm		hi. i want my notebook to load my usual network configuration _before_ logging into my user account, so i entered the data into /etc/network/interfaces; yet, the static ipv4 configuration i entered is not shown with ifconfig after running '/etc/init.d/networking restart'. did i overlook something?
2009-07-18T04:02:00.000Z	ascheel	jvm	you need to disable network-manager
2009-07-18T04:03:00.000Z	jvm	ascheel	will i still be able to change my network configuration easily after user login, then?
2009-07-18T04:03:00.000Z	ascheel	jvm	no
2009-07-18T04:03:00.000Z	jvm	ascheel	is there no other solution to apply a 'default profile', that's in effect even before login?
2009-07-18T04:03:00.000Z	ascheel	jvm	as far as I know, you either handle them manually through the OS or you wait for gnome to boot and manage it with the network-manager.  I COULD be wrong, though.
2009-07-18T04:04:00.000Z	ascheel	jvm	if there is I don't know it, but there very well could be.
2009-07-18T04:05:00.000Z	ascheel	jvm	System => Preferences => Startup Programs
2009-07-18T04:17:00.000Z	jvm	ascheel	i set up my static network config in a console terminal before logging into my user account.
2009-07-18T04:14:00.000Z	jvm	ascheel	system->preferences affects my own user, but only starting from the time ive logged in, or not?
2009-07-18T04:14:00.000Z	ascheel	jvm	that's correct.  Only after you've logged in
2009-07-18T04:15:00.000Z	jvm	ascheel	then how does deactivating network-manager there change anything about my "/etc/init.d/networking restart does not apply /etc/network/interfaces settings" problem?
2009-07-18T04:16:00.000Z	ascheel	jvm	when you log in, it overwrites the changes you've made to /etc/network/interfaces
2009-07-18T04:17:00.000Z	jvm	ascheel	yet ifconfig didnt show the changes i expected.
2009-07-18T04:17:00.000Z	ascheel	jvm	but when you logged into your account, the network-manager handles things its own way
2009-07-18T04:18:00.000Z	ascheel	jvm	and if you haven't, try doing this:  /etc/init.d/networking restart
2009-07-18T04:18:00.000Z	jvm	ascheel	i didnt login yet at the time i came here and started complaining ;)
2009-07-18T04:19:00.000Z	ascheel	jvm	so you made changes to the interfaces file and the changes didn't take immediately?  Is that what you're saying?
2009-07-18T04:20:00.000Z	jvm	ascheel	i started up the computer, changed to a console, did _not_ log into gnome, modified the interfaces file with vim, ran '/etc/init.d/networking restart; ifconfig eth0' and the configuration i entered in the interfaces file was not applied yet.
2009-07-18T04:21:00.000Z	ascheel	jvm	not sure.  Sorry man
2009-07-18T04:21:00.000Z	jvm	ascheel	thanks anyway.
