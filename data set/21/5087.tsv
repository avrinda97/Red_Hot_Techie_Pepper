2008-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	netlarlinux		I am on Gutsy and want to see if I can connect to a network USB wireless adapter
2008-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	netlarlinux		the model number is MA111
2008-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	netlarlinux		How can I get it to work
2008-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	khermans	netlarlinux	plug it in
2008-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	khermans	netlarlinux	dmesg says ?
2008-01-03T06:39:00.000Z	khermans	netlarlinux	even in dmesg ?
2008-01-03T06:40:00.000Z	khermans	netlarlinux	type 'dmesg'
2008-01-03T06:40:00.000Z	khermans	netlarlinux	dmesg | tail
2008-01-03T06:42:00.000Z	netlarlinux	khermans	it does show the prism2usb on the list
2008-01-03T06:43:00.000Z	netlarlinux	khermans	can i pm you?
2008-01-03T06:43:00.000Z	khermans	netlarlinux	i have to identify firstm but yeah
2008-01-03T06:46:00.000Z	netlarlinux	khermans	i saw on the list about something being rejected due to insuffiencent bus power
2008-01-03T06:48:00.000Z	khermans	netlarlinux	perhaps you need a usb 2.0 or "high speed" port
2008-01-03T06:53:00.000Z	netlarlinux	khermans	what kind of message should i be getting?
2008-01-03T06:54:00.000Z	khermans	netlarlinux	check ifconfig -a to see if your device has registered
2008-01-03T06:56:00.000Z	netlarlinux	khermans	i do not see it, currently i am connected directly
2008-01-03T06:56:00.000Z	khermans	netlarlinux	dmesg says it registered properly/
2008-01-03T07:03:00.000Z	netlarlinux	khermans	i think there may not be suffecient bus power to the device
2008-01-03T07:03:00.000Z	khermans	netlarlinux	perhaps you cant use it on that port then
2008-01-03T07:04:00.000Z	netlarlinux	khermans	is a murderer?
2008-01-03T07:05:00.000Z	khermans	netlarlinux	he was referring to hans reiser
