2009-09-03T22:22:00.000Z	grawity	Quasar1048	This seems to be an official Ubuntu main repository mirror. So the PGP key should be already included with Ubuntu.
2009-09-03T22:23:00.000Z	Quasar1048	grawity	I dont see that repo.. I have two for jaunty, but neither of them are that one..

2009-09-03T22:29:00.000Z	Quasar1048		I dont see the repo its talking about... so how do I get the key for it?
2009-09-03T22:31:00.000Z	grawity	Quasar1048	The one you want is an _official_ repo
2009-09-03T22:31:00.000Z	grawity	Quasar1048	And in your screenshot it's the "Third-party" tab.
2009-09-03T22:32:00.000Z	grawity	Quasar1048	The one you want goes in 'Ubuntu software'
