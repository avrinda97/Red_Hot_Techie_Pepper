2009-12-08T14:53:00.000Z	UNewb		hello
2009-12-08T14:55:00.000Z	UNewb		I'm having some difficulties installing Ubuntu... I burned it to my CD and booted up with it, the first few stages were fine until I got to the Partition...
2009-12-08T14:57:00.000Z	UNewb		Well I'm running Windows at the moment, and I don't want to lose it so I selected the option to install side-by-side so I could choose at startup which OS to use...
2009-12-08T14:57:00.000Z	UNewb		It then went on to partition my HDD but that didn't work, it gave me an error after about an hour of what I thought was the process taking place...
2009-12-08T14:58:00.000Z	UNewb		I haven't tried windows, I chose to close the installation and when I did, it booted me instantly to the Ubuntu desktop via the LIVE CD
2009-12-08T14:59:00.000Z	UNewb		But it said something along the lines of error partitioning drive lol
2009-12-08T15:00:00.000Z	UNewb		Well one thing that's bugging me is that I have two separate HDD's, one has Windows on it and some files, the other I use specifically for my game installations... they're both 500gb, but the second one never appears anywhere, I can't view it from BIOS or choose to partition it or anything.
2009-12-08T15:00:00.000Z	UNewb		Okay, when I run gparted, it shows 1mb unallocated, and then my main HDD ntfs with 289gb unused.
2009-12-08T15:01:00.000Z	indus	UNewb	yeah you saying you use it for game installations, if the bios cant see it, how exactly did u putgames on it?
2009-12-08T15:02:00.000Z	indus	UNewb	the bios first post screen should list it as a device
2009-12-08T15:02:00.000Z	indus	UNewb	after all the cdrom /dvd stuff
2009-12-08T15:04:00.000Z	indus	UNewb	fdisk -l might show it
2009-12-08T15:05:00.000Z	indus	UNewb	yeah maybe it needs setting in bios to sata controller or raid etc
2009-12-08T15:22:00.000Z	indus	UNewb	never mind him
2009-12-08T15:19:00.000Z	indus	UNewb	ubuntu is a newbie too and needs some cooperation from the user :)
2009-12-08T15:21:00.000Z	indus	UNewb	relax
2009-12-08T15:21:00.000Z	UNewb	indus	I'm relaxed until someone like Spaceghost calls me an idiot.
