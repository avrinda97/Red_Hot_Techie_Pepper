2010-04-22T04:13:00.000Z	mfive		hey guys, is there anyone here that may be able to answer a few (i think) simple questions about virtualhosts and subdomains
2010-04-22T04:14:00.000Z	nsadmin	mfive	a lot of that is probably going to involve dns
2010-04-22T04:18:00.000Z	nsadmin	mfive	example?
2010-04-22T04:21:00.000Z	mfive	nsadmin	I have several sites I'm developing. They are located in /var/www/site1, /var/www/site2, /var/www/site3. So they have relative links in the html/php files to images <img src="/images/234.jpg" />, that way, when the site goes live I don't have to change a thing. So i set these up as subdomain virtualhosts. and it works fantastic. All of my images show up when I go to http://site1.myhostname
2010-04-22T04:24:00.000Z	mfive	nsadmin	it's not an "error" it's just like if you were to open your browser and go to http://somerandomtext
2010-04-22T04:34:00.000Z	mfive	nsadmin	- my host, but that's probably the problem, huh
2010-04-22T04:45:00.000Z	nsadmin	mfive	if you put the subdomains to the same IP address, then the web server has to differentiate based on the name it sees in the browser request headers
2010-04-22T04:46:00.000Z	nsadmin	mfive	you can do virtual hosting, which means the web server will look at the name
2010-04-22T04:54:00.000Z	nsadmin	mfive	do you have a static IP?
2010-04-22T04:55:00.000Z	mfive	nsadmin	I have a static local ip address. not a static ip address from my ISP though
2010-04-22T04:57:00.000Z	mfive	nsadmin	I'm not sure what you're getting at, can't I use an update client
2010-04-22T04:57:00.000Z	mfive	nsadmin	so that would be my temporary sollution until i get a static ip from my ISP
2010-04-22T06:10:00.000Z	mfive	nsadmin	so I set up my domain name to work with zoneedit.com's DNS servers
2010-04-22T06:12:00.000Z	nsadmin	mfive	what are the domain names? you can pm them to me if uncomfortable, or not...
2010-04-22T06:13:00.000Z	mfive	nsadmin	pm sent
2010-04-22T06:37:00.000Z	mfive	nsadmin	sorry got disconnected. were you saying ther's more i need to do, or will this happen as the DNS propogates filly?
2010-04-22T06:38:00.000Z	nsadmin	mfive	what I found was...
2010-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	mfive	nsadmin	that's strange, i wonder if it takes zoneedit.com a while to make those
2010-04-22T06:44:00.000Z	mfive	nsadmin	it was ns2 and ns4 (primary is ns2)
2010-04-22T06:45:00.000Z	mfive	nsadmin	right on, I'll just wait. i don't want to risk you not being here when it happens though, what steps should I take once they are there (or do you need that info for the next steps?)
2010-04-22T06:47:00.000Z	mfive	nsadmin	just read their FAQ. They won't make the changegs until the nameservers are set (which might take a little while)
