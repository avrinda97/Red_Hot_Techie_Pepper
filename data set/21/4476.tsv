2008-04-22T00:08:00.000Z	Baby_Shambl3s		what is faster, elinks or w3m as a text browser?
2008-04-22T00:10:00.000Z	Lamego	Baby_Shambl3s	there should be no major performance difference between 2 console mode browsers
2008-04-22T00:11:00.000Z	Baby_Shambl3s	Lamego	hmmm just thought since w3m introduces color and elinks doesnt "or it could be my noobness" I thought elinks was faster and took less resources
