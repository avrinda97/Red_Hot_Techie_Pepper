2007-01-21T11:13:00.000Z	ardchoille42	adaptr	lol
2007-01-21T11:24:00.000Z	ardchoille42	adaptr	Does the drive need to be unmounted in order for fdisk to work?
2007-01-21T11:24:00.000Z	adaptr	ardchoille42	nope
2007-01-21T11:24:00.000Z	ardchoille42	adaptr	Ah, ok
2007-01-21T11:25:00.000Z	adaptr	ardchoille42	in this case they are :)
2007-01-21T11:28:00.000Z	ardchoille42	adaptr	I don't see a "-L" option in man fdisk. Are sudu fdisk -l and sudo fdisk -L the same thing?
2007-01-21T11:29:00.000Z	adaptr	ardchoille42	well, I am 100% sure it was still -L in Dapper.. it seems they changed that :(
2007-01-21T11:29:00.000Z	ardchoille42	adaptr	Yeah, they must have changed it, I'm on Dapper
2007-01-21T11:31:00.000Z	ardchoille42	adaptr	Well, it would help if they wouldn't change things
2007-01-22T17:19:00.000Z	adaptr	ardchoille42	dri is somewhat different than a binary nvidia driver
2007-01-22T17:21:00.000Z	ardchoille42	adaptr	I think "Direct Rendering: Yes" != the ability to do 3d graphics.. which means the "Direct Rendering:Yes" means nothing.
2007-01-22T17:21:00.000Z	adaptr	ardchoille42	you think, or you know for a fact ?
2007-01-22T17:21:00.000Z	ardchoille42	adaptr	Well,  I am using onboard graphics with the via driver, and I can't do 3d graphics, but my Direct Rendering says yes.
2007-01-22T17:22:00.000Z	adaptr	ardchoille42	so not even Mesa works for you ?
