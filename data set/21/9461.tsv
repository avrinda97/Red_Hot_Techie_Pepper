2005-12-13T16:36:00.000Z	grshpr		Sorry for saying this twice, but if I want to restart gnome without restarting my computer, how do I do?
2005-12-13T16:36:00.000Z	dooglus	grshpr	sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart
2005-12-19T10:40:00.000Z	dooglus	grshpr	just install xubuntu-desktop
2005-12-19T10:40:00.000Z	grshpr	dooglus	cafuego: ok. :)
2005-12-19T10:41:00.000Z	grshpr	dooglus	where do i find xubuntu-desktop using synaptic? could not generate any results with search words: xubuntu-desktop and xubuntu.
2005-12-19T10:42:00.000Z	dooglus	grshpr	maybe it's only available for breezy then
2005-12-19T10:42:00.000Z	grshpr	dooglus	most likely.
2005-12-19T10:43:00.000Z	grshpr	dooglus	would a upgrade to breezy be easily done without having to remove any of my current information?
2005-12-19T10:43:00.000Z	dooglus	grshpr	I see "500 http://archive.ubuntu.com breezy/universe Packages" - so it's in 'universe' for breezy.
2005-12-19T10:43:00.000Z	dooglus	grshpr	it's quite a lot to download.
2005-12-19T10:43:00.000Z	grshpr	dooglus	oh, ok, i'll try add that to respitories instead.
2005-12-19T10:44:00.000Z	dooglus	grshpr	I'm pretty sure that xubuntu-desktop is just an empty meta-package anyway.
2005-12-19T10:44:00.000Z	grshpr	dooglus	what does that mean?
2005-12-19T10:44:00.000Z	dooglus	grshpr	just install these, and you'll have the same effect: abiword, acpi, acpi-support, acpid, anacron, apmd, bc, bogofilter, cdparanoia, cdrecord, cupsys, cupsys-bsd, cupsys-client, cupsys-driver-gimpprint, dbus-1-utils, dc, doc-debian, dvd+rw-tools, esound, fetchmail, firefox, foomatic-db, foomatic-db-engine, foomatic-db-gimp-print, foomatic-db-hpijs, foomatic-filters, foomatic-filters-ppds, gaim, gqview, graveman, gs-esp, hal, hotkey-setup, hplip-base
2005-12-19T10:45:00.000Z	dooglus	grshpr	that's the list of packages that xubuntu-desktop brings in
2005-12-19T10:45:00.000Z	grshpr	dooglus	well... i need xfce. :)
2005-12-19T10:45:00.000Z	grshpr	dooglus	so, xfce or xfce4?
2005-12-19T10:46:00.000Z	dooglus	grshpr	xfce4 is the newer of the two
2005-12-19T10:46:00.000Z	dooglus	grshpr	I'd go for that if I was you
2005-12-19T10:46:00.000Z	grshpr	dooglus	ok
2005-12-19T10:47:00.000Z	grshpr	dooglus	thx m8.
