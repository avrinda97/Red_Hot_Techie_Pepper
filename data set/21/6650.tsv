2007-02-26T12:15:00.000Z	snowpunk98		Can I ask a dumb question
2007-02-26T12:17:00.000Z	snowpunk98		When I setup a Windows machine I always create a C partition for just the OS and usually programs and the remainder of the disk for dynamic/static data
2007-02-26T12:18:00.000Z	snowpunk98		When I create partitions in linux what would be the equivalent
2007-02-26T12:19:00.000Z	tanlaan	snowpunk98	you would make a 10mb boot partition, a 200mb+ swap partition, then the rest of the drive would be your / *root* partition
2007-02-26T12:19:00.000Z	snowpunk98	tanlaan	10MB boot do you mean 10GB
2007-02-26T12:19:00.000Z	tanlaan	snowpunk98	the root partition is like the C partition in windows
2007-02-26T12:20:00.000Z	tanlaan	snowpunk98	nope, i mean 10 mb that is all you should need for the boot partition *its where grub goes to load up linux or any other OS on your computer*
2007-02-26T12:20:00.000Z	snowpunk98	tanlaan	oh what about swap, I currently have a 1GB swap
2007-02-26T12:21:00.000Z	tanlaan	snowpunk98	I dont think you will be needing THAT much for swap, swap is just to put the things your RAM cant handle at the moment. How much RAM do you have?
2007-02-26T12:21:00.000Z	snowpunk98	tanlaan	1GB
2007-02-26T12:22:00.000Z	tanlaan	snowpunk98	yea you really dont need that much, but its fine if you dont want to take the time to change it
2007-02-26T12:22:00.000Z	tanlaan	snowpunk98	its not going to harm anything
2007-02-26T12:23:00.000Z	tanlaan	snowpunk98	I currently have what I told you and 1gb of RAM and im doing great
2007-02-26T12:23:00.000Z	snowpunk98	tanlaan	if I want the ability in the future to just remove the OS but leave my data behind (example being in windows where I could reinstall windows on C and my data on D is fine)
2007-02-26T12:23:00.000Z	snowpunk98	tanlaan	How would I set that up 10MB boot, 1GB swap, root is data or the OS?
2007-02-26T12:24:00.000Z	tanlaan	snowpunk98	hmm root is usually everything, your OS and data. But I suppose you could seperate your drive into another partition so you have one for OS and one for your personal date
2007-02-26T12:25:00.000Z	tanlaan	snowpunk98	I just dont know how much you would want to save for the OS and the applications
2007-02-26T12:26:00.000Z	snowpunk98	tanlaan	My concern is that if I put my data on the same partition with my OS and my OS gets screwed up so bad I lose my data
2007-02-26T12:26:00.000Z	tanlaan	snowpunk98	what kind of data are you talking about?
2007-02-26T12:26:00.000Z	snowpunk98	tanlaan	Pictures, music, documents, etc important things I dont want to lose
2007-02-26T12:28:00.000Z	tanlaan	snowpunk98	listen to him, im a noob :P haha
