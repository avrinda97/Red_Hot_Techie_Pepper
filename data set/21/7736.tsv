2010-07-25T10:01:00.000Z	terrylm		Any help with grub?
2010-07-25T10:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	I think what it is saying is it can't find your partition for Ubuntu, or use it at least
2010-07-25T10:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	no /  and no Ubuntu
2010-07-25T10:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	either that or the kernel can't be used properly, hence kernel panic
2010-07-25T10:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	it is a fresh install or?
2010-07-25T10:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	ok
2010-07-25T10:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	Have you done Ubuntu before?
2010-07-25T10:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	oh so the problem was with 10.04, and then you put 9.04 on instead?
2010-07-25T10:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	a dual boot?
2010-07-25T10:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	right uhmm
2010-07-25T10:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	so which Grub you got on there?
2010-07-25T10:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	why dual booting 9.04 and 10.04?  since the problem with Grub ?
2010-07-25T10:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	really the older Grub is better for most of us,  the one that 9.04 uses for example, but 10.04 nope.  In fact quite a few distros are still using Grub by default, rather than Grub 2, even Fedora which is interesting, since Fedora is more cutting edge than Ubuntu, gets most stuff first.
2010-07-25T10:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	personally I prefer 9.04 over 10.04, for various reasons, and 9.04 is still good to use untill  the end of October, when support runs out
2010-07-25T10:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	wrekt Newer is not always better! Yeah
2010-07-25T10:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	ok so whats the problem?
2010-07-25T10:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	exactly?
2010-07-25T10:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	Do you know that 10.04 uses a completly different version of Grub than what 9.04 uses?  9.04 is the old Grub,  10.04 is Grub 2
2010-07-25T10:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	What boots up?  Also do you know which Grub is being used?
2010-07-25T10:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	ok
2010-07-25T10:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	terrylm	messing around with Grub is useualy not fun
