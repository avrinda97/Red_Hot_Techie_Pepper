2005-12-26T06:33:00.000Z	markive		:O
2005-12-26T06:33:00.000Z	iflipti	markive	 I'm also trying to get a PCMCIA card to work.
2005-12-26T06:34:00.000Z	markive	iflipti	mt 1450 card is a internal pci card in my d600
2005-12-26T06:34:00.000Z	iflipti	markive	does the card show up in your device manager?
2005-12-26T06:35:00.000Z	markive	iflipti	yeah it all looks like its there and working  , just can't see any wifi devics or networks
2005-12-26T06:37:00.000Z	iflipti	markive	That's odd.  I have the same trouble.  The card shows up in the device manager, and the network connection even says that it's receiving packets (ping packets I assume), but no Internet or any other network stuff
2005-12-26T06:37:00.000Z	iflipti	markive	I'm going to search a bit more...
2005-12-26T06:38:00.000Z	markive	iflipti	mine looks like it not recieving anything
2005-12-26T06:38:00.000Z	markive	iflipti	you got that running in linux?
2005-12-26T06:41:00.000Z	iflipti	markive	no, I'm on another computer with a linux box right next to it
2005-12-26T06:42:00.000Z	iflipti	markive	no, the other computer is a mac connected via 802.11g wireless.  The linux box has a PCMCIA card plugged into it, and I'm trying to get that to work
2005-12-26T06:43:00.000Z	markive	iflipti	i wish i'd never had bought it  , it was an upgrade i saw on ebay , i had the intel proset 2100 and that worked wicked
2005-12-26T08:29:00.000Z	iflipti	markive	 I found a page that might be helpful to you with your card
2005-12-26T08:29:00.000Z	iflipti	markive	yeah, one moment while I find it again
2005-12-26T08:30:00.000Z	iflipti	markive	 what's the name of your wireless card again?
2005-12-26T08:32:00.000Z	iflipti	markive	try this http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Orinoco.html
2005-12-26T08:33:00.000Z	iflipti	markive	 the orinoco driver supports IEEE, which is what your wireless cardneeds
2005-12-26T08:34:00.000Z	markive	iflipti	for xp or ubuntu?
2005-12-26T08:36:00.000Z	iflipti	markive	 did you get that webpage?
