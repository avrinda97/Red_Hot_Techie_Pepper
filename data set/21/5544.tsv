2008-02-14T20:20:00.000Z	rever		Has anyone been able to play 1080p HD content without issue?
2008-02-14T20:21:00.000Z	rever		I have a Pentium T7700 with 2 Gb Ram and Nvidia 8600 GT 512 MB with latest drivers.
2008-02-14T20:21:00.000Z	bazhang	rever	you mean the dvd or the content?
2008-02-14T20:22:00.000Z	rever	bazhang	Content I download from internet. IE movie trailers and such
2008-02-14T20:24:00.000Z	bazhang	rever	what file format? wmv avi etc
2008-02-14T20:24:00.000Z	rever	bazhang	I have tried wmv, avi and mov
2008-02-14T20:25:00.000Z	bazhang	rever	wmv is hit and miss (drm issue I believe) though avi and mov should be fine--is this with compiz running? than can sometimes mess with video
2008-02-14T20:27:00.000Z	rever	bazhang	no compiz running on the system. Odd thing is I have an old system with 7800GS 256MB 3GB Ram and 2500+ and it play content fine. Only problem is it runs M$. Wifes system
2008-02-14T20:30:00.000Z	rever	bazhang	What is the best player to use for HD Content on Gutsy?
2008-02-14T20:30:00.000Z	bazhang	rever	I have had luck with vlc; opinions vary on that one
2008-02-14T20:31:00.000Z	bazhang	rever	you may also want to visit www.medibuntu.org and get the win32codecs if you dont have them
2008-02-14T20:33:00.000Z	rever	bazhang	I have all the codecs and like I said the play OK just not as well as I thought. On my older system everything is smooth. CPU is low too. Here on the dual core I get 78% so thats one full core and haf of another
2008-02-14T20:34:00.000Z	bazhang	rever	what driver you have for that video card?
2008-02-14T20:34:00.000Z	rever	bazhang	The latest 169 buy Nvidia
2008-02-14T20:35:00.000Z	rever	bazhang	I used envy
2008-02-14T20:36:00.000Z	rever	bazhang	I am thinking about recompiling mplayer with better options as I do not think it was compiled to play HD content.
2008-02-14T20:37:00.000Z	bazhang	rever	you might also consider using the restricted driver manager to install the drivers--envy is not well considered here
2008-02-14T20:37:00.000Z	rever	bazhang	the restricted driver is outdated. I was going to do it manually but decided to use envy since it builds a deb package.
2008-02-14T20:39:00.000Z	rever	bazhang	it worked and everything loads without issues and I configured xorg myself. So other than the envy created a deb package it is the same as running the nvidia installer itself. From what I can see
2008-02-14T20:39:00.000Z	bazhang	rever	I have no dog in this fight but official ubuntu policy is to not support envy
2008-02-14T20:40:00.000Z	rever	bazhang	I have not fight either. Will not use it in the future then
