2005-04-26T09:01:00.000Z	djm62	GnuKemist	and can your card see the AP?
2005-04-26T08:58:00.000Z	djm62	GnuKemist	have you run dhclient?
2005-04-26T08:58:00.000Z	GnuKemist	djm62	yup
2005-04-26T08:59:00.000Z	djm62	GnuKemist	are you using WEP? Should you be?
2005-04-26T08:59:00.000Z	GnuKemist	djm62	at home I use wep... and the second place at work does it too
2005-04-26T09:00:00.000Z	djm62	GnuKemist	have you went to menu System->Administration->Networking, and put in values you know to be correct?
2005-04-26T09:01:00.000Z	GnuKemist	djm62	yup... via the gui and command line
2005-04-26T09:01:00.000Z	GnuKemist	djm62	iwconfig shows all the right info
2005-04-26T09:01:00.000Z	GnuKemist	djm62	yes
2005-04-26T09:02:00.000Z	GnuKemist	djm62	my home ap even filters by the mac so it should be ok
2005-04-26T09:03:00.000Z	GnuKemist	djm62	didn't try that yet... am not at home atm
2005-04-26T09:04:00.000Z	djm62	GnuKemist	having set up iwconfig, try running dhclient eth1, to see what point it fails at
2005-04-26T09:04:00.000Z	GnuKemist	djm62	folta it is almost as if dhclient fails
2005-04-26T09:05:00.000Z	GnuKemist	djm62	tried it ... lemme check what the final message says
2005-04-26T09:05:00.000Z	GnuKemist	djm62	no working leases in persistent database
2005-04-26T09:07:00.000Z	djm62	GnuKemist	that's a new one on me, that error
2005-04-26T09:08:00.000Z	GnuKemist	djm62	hummmm
2005-04-26T09:09:00.000Z	djm62	GnuKemist	google that error message text, and linux
2005-04-26T09:10:00.000Z	GnuKemist	djm62	http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-5745.html
2005-04-26T09:12:00.000Z	GnuKemist	djm62	so what you're saying is that dhclient is looking for the ip in the laptop itself?
2005-04-26T09:14:00.000Z	GnuKemist	djm62	maybe a good ol' flush of the router tables could do the trick at home???  But here at work....
