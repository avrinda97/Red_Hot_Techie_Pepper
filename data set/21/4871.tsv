2011-07-14T21:46:00.000Z	TBotNik		Repeating: All,  Couple quick Qs.  1. Have DT and connect with wireless, but want to open eth0 to use router for local network. Anyone have resources for this?  2. Have bash script trying to work on remote web server, and giving error.  PB link paste.ubuntu.com/644262/
2011-07-14T21:47:00.000Z	rww	TBotNik	Which distribution is the remote server running?
2011-07-14T21:48:00.000Z	TBotNik	rww	Not sure, let me check
2011-07-14T21:49:00.000Z	rww	TBotNik	If it's Ubuntu, those aren't the right directories and filenames for Ubuntu servers. If it's running something RedHat-based (which is what uses those filenames), you'd need to ask in the channel for that distribution.
2011-07-14T21:51:00.000Z	TBotNik	rww	Yeah I'm thinking maybe some version of CentOS, but not sure.  Anyway is basic bash failure, cause is 'remature exit' error and not jumping out at me so not as good at debugging as I think I am.  LOL :)
2011-07-14T21:51:00.000Z	TBotNik	rww	premature not remature, Ha HA LOL
2011-07-14T21:52:00.000Z	TBotNik	rww	Think it is something inside the "IF Then"
2011-07-14T21:54:00.000Z	TBotNik	rww	I know remote host is not U-Box as I have to "su"+ pwd to log to superuser instead of sudo cmd.
2011-07-14T21:56:00.000Z	TBotNik	rww	If we change the Apache restart to run with /etc/init.d/apache2 restart, then all other code should run on U-Box, least I think, since simple move ('mv') and copy ('cp') commands.
2011-07-14T22:00:00.000Z	TBotNik	rww	Reason for this is permissions will not allow a direct upload on this machine, so have to load to local user folder, then jump to SU and execute the commands or script.  Right now the uploaded httpd.conf file has an error, so trying the scrip with 'restore' option to make this quick and not keep the server out of production with the errors occur.  Debugging the Apache errors is another effort, but have some other guys helping with that,
2011-07-14T22:28:00.000Z	TBotNik	rww	You try with changed call to Apache?
2011-08-06T08:47:00.000Z	rww	TBotNik	when your BIOS screen pops up after you press the power button, hold down shift. continue holding down shift. GRUB should pop up.
2011-08-06T08:47:00.000Z	TBotNik	rww	Think I already stated "that doesn't work", but if not here it is again.
2011-08-06T08:48:00.000Z	rww	TBotNik	I read what you said. You're doing it at the wrong time if it's not working :P
2011-08-06T08:49:00.000Z	TBotNik	rww	Anyway I want it to alway show, not have to worry about holding a key "at the right time" since that does not work at all on this box.  Tried it at least 20 times now and nothing.
2011-08-06T08:50:00.000Z	TBotNik	rww	I know there is a setting for how many seconds it will show.  Do you know the setting?
2011-08-06T08:50:00.000Z	rww	TBotNik	I forget, but if you're using GRUB 2, it's in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2
2011-08-06T08:51:00.000Z	TBotNik	rww	Someone has this box set to "0" seconds show time, that is why does not show and pressing ESC or SHIFT not working.
2011-08-06T08:52:00.000Z	TBotNik	rww	On liveCD but just installed grub, and have it up.
2011-08-06T08:59:00.000Z	TBotNik	rww	Do you have a HOWTO for grub vs grub2?
2011-08-06T09:00:00.000Z	rww	TBotNik	I have our documentation on GRUB and on GRUB2. That's about it. GRUB2's, you have. GRUB's is https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
