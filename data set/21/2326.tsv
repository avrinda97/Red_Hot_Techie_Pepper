2010-11-20T02:59:00.000Z	Stereocaulon		Running Maverick, running into a weird error. Under Locations => Personal Folder tries to open all files contained in /home/$USER in Totem :-P Does anyone know where the Tab "Locations" is defined, so that I may restore it into it's old glory?
2010-11-20T03:00:00.000Z	jrib	Stereocaulon	go to nautilus, right click on a directory, you should be able to make them open up in nautilus there
2010-11-20T03:02:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	jrib	true, but that does not fix the link to my Personal Directory that is situated in "Locations" on my Gnome Panel.
2010-11-20T03:02:00.000Z	jrib	Stereocaulon	you mean "Places" right?
2010-11-20T03:03:00.000Z	jrib	Stereocaulon	are you translating what it actually says?
2010-11-20T03:03:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	jrib	yes, probably, running the Dutch version of the Desktop. It is indeed one of the perils of "direct" translation of GUI elements
2010-11-20T03:04:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	jrib	and yes, I do mean "Places"
2010-11-20T03:04:00.000Z	jrib	Stereocaulon	it should work.  Right click on a directory, open with other application, select "File Browser", mark the checkbox for it to remember
2010-11-20T03:08:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	jrib	yes that does indeed work. Thanks! I'm very curious to find out how it came to be that way that it opened in Totem and *only* when clicked upon the link Places => Personal Files. Opening the directory  /home/$USER just opens the right directory without hassle.
2010-11-20T03:08:00.000Z	jrib	Stereocaulon	no idea what causes it.  It's some sort of bug probably, because you aren't the first to ask about it
2010-11-20T03:11:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	jrib	I do have an idea though...I'm used to open Video_TS folders with VLC if the menu support on a particular DVD is lacking. I had a particulary troublesome DVD last weekend that refused to play past a certain chapter on *any* Media player. It must have been that time that the anomaly took place.
2010-11-20T03:11:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	jrib	I even needed to *rip* the DVD before I could play that bloody chapter...
2010-11-20T04:23:00.000Z	jrib	Stereocaulon	alesan: "sudo dist-upgrade" is not how you upgrade.  ubottu's link has correct instructions
2010-11-20T04:24:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	jrib	you are of course right, I forgot the apt-part
2010-11-20T04:24:00.000Z	jrib	Stereocaulon	that's not the proper way to upgrade ubuntu
2010-11-20T04:25:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	jrib	not even on 9.04?
2010-11-20T04:25:00.000Z	jrib	Stereocaulon	not since like dapper iirc
2010-11-20T04:26:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	jrib	oh my, and I've been using Ubuntu since Warty...Shame on me :-/
2011-05-08T18:57:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	jrib	dang you beat me to it ;-)
2012-01-30T15:38:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	jrib	I agree
2012-05-08T02:31:00.000Z	jrib	Stereocaulon	hi
