2007-01-22T13:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Cold_FiRe	ubuntu can already read your NTFS, however writing isn't completely stable yet.  No need to reformat to fat
2007-01-22T13:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Cold_FiRe	if you read those pages, you get commands, to apt-get them: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/InstallingCompiz
2007-01-22T13:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Cold_FiRe	also, XGL/Beryl/etc support is in #ubuntu-xgl, not here.
2007-01-22T14:18:00.000Z	Flannel	Cold_FiRe	did you add the repositories you were supposed to?
2007-01-22T14:19:00.000Z	Cold_FiRe	Flannel	whats repositories?
2007-01-22T14:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Cold_FiRe	which version of ubuntu are you running?
2007-01-22T14:21:00.000Z	Flannel	Cold_FiRe	you need to enable universe, but actually, to run Compiz, you already need either XGL or AIGLX, read the first link paragraph on the page, follow the link
2007-01-22T14:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Cold_FiRe	You were using it correctly, you just didn't have universe enabled
2007-01-22T14:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Cold_FiRe	dapper is 6.06, you're running 6.10 (Edgy)
2007-01-22T16:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Cold_FiRe	however, you're doing an awful lot of compiling, Have you searched in the repositories?
2007-01-28T13:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Cold_FiRe	that's not true.  windows has a ext3 driver (windows by default can't read ext2 either)
