2005-07-28T12:34:00.000Z	demirg		hi everybody, can anyone show me a tried howto about installing nvidia geforce ddr 256 driver at ubuntu???
2005-07-28T12:35:00.000Z	nikkia	demirg	just follow any of the howto's on the subject, but make sure you do not get the latest driver, you need the last non-7xxx series driver for the Geforce 256
2005-07-28T12:37:00.000Z	demirg	nikkia	why not non-7xxx, I tried  7667...
2005-07-28T12:37:00.000Z	nikkia	demirg	because nvidia no longer support anything older than the geforce 4
2005-07-28T12:38:00.000Z	demirg	nikkia	thanks, i will try 6111 :)
2005-07-28T14:17:00.000Z	demirg	nikkia	you there?

2005-07-28T14:18:00.000Z	nikkia	demirg	i'm wading thru building a LFS system
2005-07-28T14:19:00.000Z	demirg	nikkia	can i ask you a small thing?
2005-07-28T14:19:00.000Z	nikkia	demirg	what is it?
2005-07-28T14:19:00.000Z	demirg	nikkia	i tried NVIDIA-6111 but i get an error message like:
2005-07-28T14:19:00.000Z	demirg	nikkia	The rivafb driver conflicts with the NVIDIA driver; the NVIDIA kernel module will still be built and installed,
2005-07-28T14:20:00.000Z	nikkia	demirg	that's just a warning
2005-07-28T14:20:00.000Z	demirg	nikkia	do u have any idea how to fix it?
2005-07-28T14:20:00.000Z	nikkia	demirg	unless you actually have the rivafb loaded, in which case, don't use the framebuffer :P
2005-07-28T14:21:00.000Z	demirg	nikkia	yea but i cannot log on to X because of that warning :)
2005-07-28T14:21:00.000Z	nikkia	demirg	its more likely you can't log on to X because you haven't configured X properly yet :)
2005-07-28T14:21:00.000Z	demirg	nikkia	might be true :)
2005-07-28T14:24:00.000Z	demirg	nikkia	ERROR: Unable to load the kernel module 'nvidia.ko'.  This is most likely because the kernel module was built using the wrong kernel source files. Please make sure you have installed the kernel source files for your kernel;
2005-07-28T14:24:00.000Z	demirg	nikkia	this was the error message i got
