2012-08-18T23:55:00.000Z	FreeMansMind		samfromat; No specific trouble here. It's just acting like Windows, Maybe I dreamed wrong about ubuntu, dunno. I was expecting faster and lighter moves. Folders are not opening faster then Windows can.
2012-08-18T23:56:00.000Z	FreeMansMind		its just only faster on starting pc. or shutting down. Rest is acting just like Windows. this is why I am thinking that something might be wrong. dunno
2012-08-18T23:58:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FreeMansMind	perhaps you need to try a lighter weight desktop environment. unity is fairly heavy.
2012-08-19T00:01:00.000Z	FreeMansMind	crimsonmane	shall I try Gnome?
2012-08-19T00:02:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FreeMansMind	Lubuntu
2012-08-19T00:04:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FreeMansMind	log out, click the gear icon next to your name, and select 2d mode
2012-08-19T00:20:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FreeMansMind	it's due to lack of being informed.
2012-08-19T00:22:00.000Z	FreeMansMind	crimsonmane	so deleting ubuntu and installing lubuntu or linux mint instead not like deleting Windows 7 and installing WIndows XP to make netbook work faster? Its not installing something less nicer right?
2012-08-19T00:23:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FreeMansMind	if you do mint, you need LXDE
2012-08-19T00:23:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FreeMansMind	whatever you do, go with LXDE spin of that distro
2012-08-19T00:24:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FreeMansMind	try. them. ALL.
2012-08-19T00:24:00.000Z	FreeMansMind	crimsonmane	do they all work in USB Drive to test?
2012-08-19T00:25:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FreeMansMind	yes.
2012-08-19T00:26:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FreeMansMind	even better, you can sudo-apt-get lxde-desktop
2012-08-19T00:27:00.000Z	FreeMansMind	crimsonmane	shall i type it now in terminal?
2012-08-19T00:29:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FreeMansMind	we're currently in Ubuntu's IRC channel, and i do not wish to disrespect their distro by suggesting Linux Mint LXDE to you, but i might have done exactly that.
2012-08-19T00:29:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FreeMansMind	didyou even try logging out and switching to Unity 2D
2012-08-19T00:29:00.000Z	FreeMansMind	crimsonmane	 I will try it all with USB drive.
2012-08-19T00:30:00.000Z	FreeMansMind	crimsonmane	 no will try now but what is this sudo-apt-get lxde-desktop
2012-08-19T00:30:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FreeMansMind	forget that command. don't do it.
2012-08-19T00:36:00.000Z	FreeMansMind	crimsonmane	 I am back. 2D look very simple to me... CPU usage wasnt so different. It was about %20
