2007-01-13T09:31:00.000Z	craigbass1976	lilly	at least until you get things working, then you can open up a hole for samba
2007-01-13T09:31:00.000Z	craigbass1976	lilly	Can you post your conf file somewhere?
2007-01-13T09:31:00.000Z	lilly	craigbass1976	ok hold on
2007-01-13T09:32:00.000Z	craigbass1976	lilly	did you start samba?
2007-01-13T09:32:00.000Z	lilly	craigbass1976	yes i did sudo /etc/init.d/samba start
2007-01-13T09:32:00.000Z	craigbass1976	lilly	ok
2007-01-13T09:34:00.000Z	lilly	craigbass1976	here's my smb.conf http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/1435/
2007-01-13T09:36:00.000Z	craigbass1976	lilly	what's your setup?  Is everything behind another firewall?
2007-01-13T09:37:00.000Z	lilly	craigbass1976	1 windows 1 linux box connected to a router. no systems have firewalls (i tihnk... i never touch iptables and i disabled firestarter)
2007-01-13T09:38:00.000Z	craigbass1976	lilly	So the router has a firewall?
2007-01-13T09:39:00.000Z	lilly	craigbass1976	the router has no firewall
2007-01-13T09:41:00.000Z	craigbass1976	lilly	send me an email.  I've got to get going now, but I'll look at this.  I've set up 3 servers, but they were all different, and this is something I should be better at.  cparker@candocomputerservices.com  Just send a blank one or something so I have a mail to reply to.
2007-01-13T09:41:00.000Z	lilly	craigbass1976	ok :)
2007-01-13T09:42:00.000Z	craigbass1976	lilly	might take a day or two, depends on how well this windows box I've got on my bench follows orders.
2007-01-13T09:42:00.000Z	lilly	craigbass1976	sure! thanks!
