2008-01-11T01:50:00.000Z	dusty_		anyone?
2008-01-11T01:50:00.000Z	rexy	dusty_	are you configuring yourself or using the screen and graphic tool?
2008-01-11T01:50:00.000Z	dusty_	rexy	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg is what im doing
2008-01-11T01:52:00.000Z	dusty_	rexy	#?
2008-01-11T01:52:00.000Z	rexy	dusty_	can you expand that into a questiom?
2008-01-11T01:55:00.000Z	rexy	dusty_	you then probably need to change the resolution in the xorg.conf and make sure you are using either the ati/radeon driver. probably a wiki on it
2008-01-11T01:58:00.000Z	dusty_	rexy	its using the correct driver and the xorg.conf has the res in it
2008-01-11T01:58:00.000Z	rexy	dusty_	can you pastebin your xorg.conf
2008-01-11T02:02:00.000Z	dusty_	rexy	?
2008-01-11T02:03:00.000Z	rexy	dusty_	remove mergedFb, you dont appear to be using it, also grep for EE in your xorg.0.log in /var/log. also maybe you need to change the ati to radeon, but that's just a guess
2008-01-11T02:05:00.000Z	rexy	dusty_	?
2008-01-11T02:06:00.000Z	rexy	dusty_	remove mergedFb, you dont appear to be using it, also grep for EE in your xorg.0.log in /var/log. also maybe you need to change the ati to radeon, but that's just a guess
2008-01-11T02:06:00.000Z	dusty_	rexy	http://pastebin.com/m48742ba6 <-- grep of EE
2008-01-11T02:07:00.000Z	rexy	dusty_	shows no errors
2008-01-11T02:08:00.000Z	rexy	dusty_	remove the line that says mergedfb, and remove the resolutions you dont want
2008-01-11T02:08:00.000Z	dusty_	rexy	ok two
