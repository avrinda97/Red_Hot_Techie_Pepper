2011-07-24T21:44:00.000Z	wh1zz0		Hi guys.. Please I a bit confused about guest additions here.. I am running natty as host and xp right in the VM (guest).. Which guest  additions am I supposed to install? Guest additions for Windows or Gust additions for Linux?
2011-07-24T21:45:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	the guest = guest additions.
2011-07-24T21:45:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	run in the guest.
2011-07-24T21:46:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	did you download from Oracle?
2011-07-24T21:48:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	notice this on this page "If you are using VirtualBox 4.0.12, please download the extension pack"  http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
2011-07-24T21:49:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	if you have the latest 4.1 I believe it is included in the regular install.
2011-07-30T13:01:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	you have a equal amount of swap to your ram ?
2011-07-30T13:01:00.000Z	wh1zz0	nit-wit	I suppose I do.. How do I check?
2011-07-30T13:02:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	I check with gparted .
2011-07-30T13:03:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	it is a partitioner you may need to install it otherwise it is in the prefrences or admin I forget.
2011-07-30T13:04:00.000Z	wh1zz0	nit-wit	Yeah.. I did sudo apt-get install gparted and it's installing
2011-07-30T13:04:00.000Z	wh1zz0	nit-wit	So how do I use it?
2011-07-30T13:05:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	cool just open it and look at the swap it has to be equal to the ram for hibernate to work.

2011-07-30T13:08:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	how much ram do you have
2011-07-30T13:09:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	you have enough swap. Haven't you noticed that starting from hibernate takes as long to bot?
2011-07-30T13:11:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	right but it takes just as long to return to a desktop as a boot does, so do you need it, otherwise that is the limit of my knowledge, I never use hibernate.
2011-07-30T13:11:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	does it sleep
2011-07-30T13:12:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	have you tried the Ubutu Forums?
2011-07-30T13:13:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	let me ask ths do you ever backup or image your OS?
2011-07-30T13:15:00.000Z	nit-wit	wh1zz0	that  link is referencing a grub you don't have, start a thread, and install grsync for a easy backup oh yout home, and consider imaging it with clonezilla in case it does break while trying to figure it out.
