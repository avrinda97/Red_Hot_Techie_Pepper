2005-04-10T15:17:00.000Z	holycow		does anyone know if there is discussion/project on getting x to autoconfigure for the monitor plugged into the system?  i know that perhaps one can use a yast like dialog that lets the user choose either the model/make or generic settings, just wondering if there is anything active going on this topic
2005-04-10T15:17:00.000Z	Xappe	holycow	mine is autoconfiguring the monitor :)
2005-04-10T15:18:00.000Z	holycow	Xappe	how? can you take your hd to any machine, plug it in and it will adjust the refresh rates and available resos for the model/make? or are you just saying you have some basic generic settings with resolution no greater than 1024x768?
2005-04-10T15:19:00.000Z	Xappe	holycow	no. i'm saying i don't have to add the refresh rates of the monitor, since i'm using DDCMode that fetches that automatically
2005-04-10T15:21:00.000Z	holycow	Xappe	really? what is ddcmode? i've not heard of this, sounds like the solution :)
2005-04-10T15:22:00.000Z	Xappe	holycow	I added option "DDCMode" "on" to my xorg.conf, and voila
2005-04-10T15:24:00.000Z	Xappe	holycow	from the monitor I think, if it supports it (but i'm not sure). the option should be added under the "device" section (i have an ATI card if that matters)
2005-04-10T15:25:00.000Z	holycow	Xappe	good enough, i'll google the rest of the info, my thanks!
2005-04-11T14:44:00.000Z	holycow	Xappe	are they more rabid there than #debian?
2005-05-01T08:21:00.000Z	holycow	Xappe	i spoke with the guys in the gnome channels and appearently esd is deprecated
