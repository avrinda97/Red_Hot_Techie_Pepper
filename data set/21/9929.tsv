2005-09-21T15:30:00.000Z	jc-denton		and hey
2005-09-21T15:30:00.000Z	jc-denton		swapon /dev/hda3 does now work
2005-09-21T15:31:00.000Z	jc-denton		i guess this is related to udev
2005-09-21T15:31:00.000Z	jc-denton		how do i enable swap on ubuntu
2005-09-21T15:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	jc-denton	add the swap partition to fstab run swapon -a
2005-09-21T15:32:00.000Z	jc-denton	erUSUL	that's what i did
2005-09-21T15:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	jc-denton	you have run mkswap /dev/xxx, have not you?
2005-09-21T15:33:00.000Z	jc-denton	erUSUL	of course
2005-09-21T15:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	jc-denton	i do not know maybe the mkswap was not right try again
2005-09-21T15:38:00.000Z	jc-denton	erUSUL	u know udev?
2005-09-21T15:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	jc-denton	probably not enough
2008-01-19T03:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	jc-denton	none
2011-01-27T04:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	jc-denton	ahci is the best mode for a sata chip to work. ide emulation is only there so retarded ( windows XP ) OS's do not choke on install
2011-01-27T04:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	jc-denton	and i say that linux forcing ahci on users is Good Thing (tm)
2011-01-27T04:07:00.000Z	jc-denton	erUSUL	will my windows still work after I changed it?
2011-01-27T04:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	jc-denton	it may need to install the ahci drivers in the next boot
2011-01-27T04:08:00.000Z	jc-denton	erUSUL	yeah like that it does not install when u just enter the cd is a good thing.
2011-01-27T04:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	jc-denton	you come here; we tell you about your evil ways. you change your bios settings and everything works ;) for the better
2011-01-27T04:09:00.000Z	jc-denton	erUSUL	I mean they could at least write it somewhere, if they don't wnat to support it
2011-01-27T04:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	jc-denton	to be fair it should support the ide mode too; somethimes you need to pass the all-generic-ide boot option
2011-01-27T04:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	jc-denton	swap does not have a mont point
