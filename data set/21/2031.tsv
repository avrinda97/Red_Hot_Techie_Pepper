2011-02-06T07:56:00.000Z	mikeliss		Anybody know how to keep ssh open?
2011-02-06T07:56:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	mikeliss	don't disconnect?
2011-02-06T07:57:00.000Z	mikeliss	tonsofpcs	it'll boot me when it goes idle for too long.
2011-02-06T07:57:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	mikeliss	(1) what's wrong with your ssh session closing? (2) I doubt the sshd is doing that.  Probably a connection thing.
2011-02-06T07:57:00.000Z	mikeliss	tonsofpcs	I have a script running in it that I can't stop. SSH gives the boot eventually when idle.
2011-02-06T07:58:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	mikeliss	why not run it inside screen?
2011-02-06T07:58:00.000Z	mikeliss	tonsofpcs	^^^
2011-02-06T07:58:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	mikeliss	ever see the simpsons episode where homer gets to work from home?
2011-02-06T07:59:00.000Z	mikeliss	tonsofpcs	ummm...maybe?
2011-02-06T07:59:00.000Z	mikeliss	tonsofpcs	wait...actually no. Now that I re-read your question.
2011-02-06T07:59:00.000Z	mikeliss	tonsofpcs	Wait, YES!
2011-02-06T07:59:00.000Z	mikeliss	tonsofpcs	I need the shift key presser.
2011-02-06T08:00:00.000Z	mikeliss	tonsofpcs	I just need to send data to it from time to time, ideally.
2011-02-06T08:01:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	mikeliss	what client?
2011-02-06T08:02:00.000Z	mikeliss	tonsofpcs	gnome-terminal
2011-02-06T08:03:00.000Z	mikeliss	tonsofpcs	hrmm...then it's just ssh, I'd guess?
2011-02-06T08:03:00.000Z	mikeliss	tonsofpcs	I could background it, and reattach in screen...if I knew how.
2011-02-06T08:05:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	mikeliss	well, you can't do that with a lot of things, so probably not
2011-02-06T08:05:00.000Z	mikeliss	tonsofpcs	got me, but looks like I have to run. Hopefully the script will keep going until I get back.
2011-02-06T08:13:00.000Z	mikeliss	tonsofpcs	Who needs a woodpecker when you can HOLD DOWN backspace!
2011-02-06T08:13:00.000Z	mikeliss	tonsofpcs	I missed my last train btw...but now I really have to go.
