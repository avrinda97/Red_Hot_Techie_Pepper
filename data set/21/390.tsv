2012-01-20T08:03:00.000Z	Zaukox		ok, yes, oh aw, frogot fsck :P and oh well :P
2012-01-20T08:03:00.000Z	Zaukox		im running that
2012-01-20T08:03:00.000Z	somsip	Zaukox	After trying fsck, I'm out of ideas
2012-01-20T07:49:00.000Z	somsip	Zaukox	Have you done a backup yet?
2012-01-20T07:49:00.000Z	Zaukox	somsip	nope, and it's badly corrupted, im on livecd, cannot run any system in hdd
2012-01-20T07:50:00.000Z	somsip	Zaukox	I strongly recommend a backup as your first priority. You might do more damage in trying to repair bad blocks, and that number of bad blocks might indicate an impending HD failure
2012-01-20T07:52:00.000Z	Zaukox	somsip	ok, i got 66 bad clusters from smart info, im not able to use gparted,  and im kind of stuck in testdisk....
2012-01-20T07:53:00.000Z	Zaukox	somsip	and zero backups, what the point of backuping a corrupted disk?
2012-01-20T07:53:00.000Z	Zaukox	somsip	idea?
2012-01-20T07:53:00.000Z	somsip	Zaukox	because you have files on there that you want to keep, I assume. If you attempt to fix the bad blocks and lose all data on the disk, you might wish you'd done a backup first. And don't spam me. Give me chance to type
2012-01-20T07:54:00.000Z	Zaukox	somsip	ok, sorry :P, yeah, i got two OS there. and nonee of them im able to boot, is a pain starting over, Really....
2012-01-20T07:55:00.000Z	somsip	Zaukox	I understand, but it happens. You could just go ahead and do a disk repair and be fine, but there is always a risk
2012-01-20T07:58:00.000Z	Zaukox	somsip	ik about it, nevermind if i run that risk, either if it gets worse, bye disk.....  yep, im not able to repair this, disk utility crashed when  i tired to get smart status and i tried to do check fs but it says, fs is not clean... and when it's mounted it comes with some kind of online slots not available?? umm, ideas pleaseee
2012-01-20T08:01:00.000Z	Zaukox	somsip	are u there??
2012-01-20T08:02:00.000Z	somsip	Zaukox	I'm no expert on HD problems. I guess you've tried running fsck without moutning the disk? And yes I'm here, but my attention is not solely on you
2012-01-20T08:11:00.000Z	Zaukox	somsip	hey, how i can make fsck scan and fix the whole disk?
2012-01-20T08:12:00.000Z	somsip	Zaukox	5
2012-01-20T08:12:00.000Z	somsip	Zaukox	ooops.
2012-01-20T08:13:00.000Z	somsip	Zaukox	http://bit.ly/yE6IKp
2012-01-20T08:15:00.000Z	somsip	Zaukox	maybe it will inspire you to try different combinations of words. I was sat here googling for you and all you were doing was repeating the same question in IRC. Go figure.
2012-01-20T08:15:00.000Z	somsip	Zaukox	Like I said, I'm no expert. I understand fsck is the tool for the job. Beyond that, you need someone else to help, or to find out a little more yourself. I'm out
