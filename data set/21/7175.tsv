2008-05-22T17:45:00.000Z	axisys	Slart	thx
2008-08-19T23:42:00.000Z	Slart	axisys	come on.. not everyone has english as a first language
2008-08-19T23:42:00.000Z	Slart	axisys	try answering the question instead
2008-08-19T23:43:00.000Z	axisys	Slart	where is the sense of humor ? :-)
2008-08-19T23:43:00.000Z	Slart	axisys	nothing funny about that
2009-05-30T02:10:00.000Z	Slart	axisys	you have a crontab for each user.. there is one for root so use that for the copy command.. not sure about the mailing stuff
2009-05-30T02:11:00.000Z	axisys	Slart	you mean use crontab ?
2009-05-30T02:11:00.000Z	axisys	Slart	that is exactly what u said :P
2009-05-30T02:13:00.000Z	Slart	axisys	yes.. crontab...there is a switch to change which users crontab you're editing..
2009-07-27T00:36:00.000Z	Slart	axisys	man renice might tell you more
2009-07-27T00:36:00.000Z	axisys	Slart	i did man renice.. but still not clear.. :-(
2009-07-27T00:37:00.000Z	Slart	axisys	20 is "idle" priority.. ie makes things run when nothing else does.. 0 is normal.. -20 is the highest priority
2009-07-27T00:38:00.000Z	axisys	Slart	thanks a lot
2009-07-27T00:38:00.000Z	Slart	axisys	you're welcome
2009-07-27T00:39:00.000Z	axisys	Slart	so in my case i made the priority to -20 .. lets see if it finishes sooner.. i am making an iso of a dvd and i want it to be fast .. i am running it like this cat /dev/cdrw > file.iso
2009-07-27T00:42:00.000Z	Slart	axisys	creating an iso probably isn't limited by cpu power, it probably depends more on data being shuffled from the dvd to the hard drive and memory
2009-07-27T00:42:00.000Z	axisys	Slart	i have 1.5g mem
2009-07-27T00:43:00.000Z	Slart	axisys	there is a utility called ionice that handles io priority.. not sure if you can change it when it's already running though
2009-07-27T00:43:00.000Z	axisys	Slart	ok
2009-07-27T00:43:00.000Z	axisys	Slart	searching the apt-cache for iso related pkg
