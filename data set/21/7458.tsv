2008-08-10T13:11:00.000Z	wols_	kittykitty	dev package don't contain any libs
2008-08-10T13:11:00.000Z	wols_	kittykitty	that's a static library, only if you compile your own stuff can you use it
2008-08-10T13:11:00.000Z	wols_	kittykitty	apt-cache search libavcodec   after you added medibuntu to your sources.list
2008-08-10T13:56:00.000Z	wols_	kittykitty	you#ve been told time and again how to do it. it won't change when you continue to ask
2008-08-10T13:57:00.000Z	wols_	kittykitty	http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libavcodec&searchon=names&suite=hardy&section=all
2008-08-10T13:58:00.000Z	wols_	kittykitty	so both ubuntu and medibuntu have it
2008-08-10T14:00:00.000Z	wols_	kittykitty	not my problem if your ubuntu is broken. security repo has it as the packages.ubuntu.com page I told you about clearly shows
2008-08-10T14:03:00.000Z	wols_	kittykitty	what ubuntu version?
2008-08-10T14:04:00.000Z	wols_	kittykitty	if it'S gutsy: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libavcodec&searchon=names&suite=gutsy&section=all
2008-08-10T14:04:00.000Z	wols_	kittykitty	upgrade to hardy LTS then
2008-08-10T14:05:00.000Z	wols_	kittykitty	there is no libavcodec for dapper and that's the end of it. now matter how much your whine dapper won't get it
