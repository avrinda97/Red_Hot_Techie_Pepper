2005-05-07T13:10:00.000Z	djm62	sudean	this is all volunteers ;)
2005-05-07T13:10:00.000Z	djm62	sudean	and internet explorer doesn't work on windows, never mind ubuntu :)
2005-05-07T13:12:00.000Z	djm62	sudean	where are you at now?
2005-05-07T13:13:00.000Z	djm62	sudean	I meant, what exactly isn't working, what do you do before it fails to work, so we know how to help you ;)
2005-05-07T13:15:00.000Z	djm62	sudean	you should have hit IRC sooner and saved a few of those tries
2005-05-07T13:16:00.000Z	djm62	sudean	can you open up a terminal? (right-click on the desktop)
2005-05-07T13:17:00.000Z	djm62	sudean	can you type "mozilla-firefox" and press enter/return
2005-05-07T13:17:00.000Z	djm62	sudean	and the terminal should give some clues as to what's going wrong
2005-05-07T13:19:00.000Z	djm62	sudean	can you now type "pkill mozilla-firefox"
2005-05-07T13:20:00.000Z	djm62	sudean	now try mozilla-firefox again
2005-05-07T13:22:00.000Z	djm62	sudean	are there no messages appearing in the terminal?
