2008-03-23T08:26:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		what's the Alt key combination to switch to a terminal?
2008-03-23T08:27:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		Firefox is nonstop freezing or crashing on me right now, driving me nuts
2008-03-23T08:29:00.000Z	ani1	Geoffrey2	when you run it from terminal whats the error?
2008-03-23T08:30:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	ani1	if I could get back to the terminal to find out, I'd tell you :)
2008-03-23T08:48:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	ani1	ok, Segmentation fault (core dumped)
2008-03-23T08:48:00.000Z	ani1	Geoffrey2	ouch ok time to debug
2008-03-23T08:48:00.000Z	ani1	Geoffrey2	first i would start up in -safe-mode and disable all plugins etc see if its flash related then you can try a new profile using -ProfileManager
2008-03-23T08:49:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	ani1	start Firefox in safe mode, or Ubuntu?
2008-03-23T08:49:00.000Z	ani1	Geoffrey2	firefox
2008-03-23T08:50:00.000Z	ani1	Geoffrey2	firefox -safe-mode uncheck all the boxes hit continue try to duplicate if you can use firefox -ProfileManager and create a new profile see if you can duplicate it let me know if you make it that far still with a problem
2008-03-23T08:51:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	ani1	ok, so start in safe mode, and make sure there are NO checks in any of the boxes?
2008-03-23T08:51:00.000Z	ani1	Geoffrey2	check all the boxes you want to eliminate all possible problems so startup without the tool bars and extensions enabled
2008-03-23T08:51:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	ani1	ah, oik
2008-03-23T09:03:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	ani1	actually, I didn't do anything yet...just asking
2008-03-23T08:56:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	ani1	well, safe mode seems to have eliminated the problem...previously, Firefox was either crashing or freezing within 15-20 seconds of being started
2008-03-23T08:57:00.000Z	ani1	Geoffrey2	also if you have a lot of entries that point to 127.0.0.1 in your /etc/hosts file make sure their spaced correctly and pointed correctly to loopback this happened to me and all browsers seg faulted. You may just want to create a new profile then and one by one reinstall you plugins
2008-03-23T09:02:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	ani1	ok, if I just delete .mozilla from my home folder, I'd be starting off with a fresh profile?
2008-03-23T09:03:00.000Z	ani1	Geoffrey2	eek you didnt have to do that but yeah it will ultimately achieve the same thing..In the future you may just want to move it if theirs anything you would need to get a hold of book marks etc.
2008-03-23T09:03:00.000Z	ani1	Geoffrey2	its better to use the -ProfileManager flag and hit net
2008-03-23T09:03:00.000Z	ani1	Geoffrey2	new*
2008-03-23T09:04:00.000Z	ani1	Geoffrey2	thats good yeah you can just mv .mozilla .mozillaold but its better to use Profile Manager
