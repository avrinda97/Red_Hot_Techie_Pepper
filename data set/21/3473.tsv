2009-01-20T20:24:00.000Z	smo_PenguinStyle		Hey there.  Does anyone know how to map windows key (super L) + E to open file explorer in ubuntu 8.10?
2009-01-20T20:24:00.000Z	easwar	smo_PenguinStyle	gconf-editor

2009-01-20T20:26:00.000Z	easwar	smo_PenguinStyle	>>keybinding_commands
2009-01-20T20:27:00.000Z	easwar	smo_PenguinStyle	just follow the directions,easier that way
2009-01-20T20:27:00.000Z	smo_PenguinStyle	easwar	 so, do I simply go to the keyboard shortcuts section in preferences?  I've already tried that, and it seems that the gnome keyboard shortcuts don't support windows key (super L) + someletter combinations.
2009-01-20T20:27:00.000Z	easwar	smo_PenguinStyle	run gconf-editor in Alt+F2
2009-01-20T20:28:00.000Z	smo_PenguinStyle	easwar	 alt+f2 == cli / console?
2009-01-20T20:28:00.000Z	easwar	smo_PenguinStyle	key combination in GUI
2009-01-20T20:30:00.000Z	easwar	smo_PenguinStyle	what happened?
2009-01-20T20:32:00.000Z	smo_PenguinStyle	easwar	 just making sure that I don't screw things up, and its taking another moment.   brb.
2009-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	smo_PenguinStyle	easwar	 Where do I go in gconf editor
2009-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	easwar	smo_PenguinStyle	press Alt+F2 on your desktop,type gconf-editor and press Enter,in the window that opens,follow />>apps>>metacity>>keybinding_commands>>edit command 1 to read nautilus
2009-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	smo_PenguinStyle	easwar	 now I understand.  I'm sorry that the coffee hasn't kicked in yet.  :)
2009-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	easwar	smo_PenguinStyle	lol,nevermind
2009-01-20T20:35:00.000Z	smo_PenguinStyle	easwar	 is it possible to create new commands for combinations like super L / windows key + R for run, and super L / windows key + E for opening nautilus?
2009-01-20T20:35:00.000Z	easwar	smo_PenguinStyle	only new key combinations
2009-01-20T20:35:00.000Z	easwar	smo_PenguinStyle	have you finished editing command 1 to read nautilus?
2009-01-20T20:36:00.000Z	smo_PenguinStyle	easwar	 does "new key combinations" equate to the ability to create superL+R, etc?
2009-01-20T20:36:00.000Z	easwar	smo_PenguinStyle	yes
2009-01-20T20:36:00.000Z	smo_PenguinStyle	easwar	 alrighty, let me try this.... momentito....
