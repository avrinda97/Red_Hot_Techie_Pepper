2012-08-19T22:19:00.000Z	bogor		I am trying to install ubuntu 12.04 LTS on flash drive. It seems to be stuck as there is no progress in progress bar. Is there any log to see if it is stuck and why it is stuck? I heard flash drives are faster the usual HDD. But my hp v220w pen drive seems to be 100 times slower than my sata HDD.
2012-08-19T22:21:00.000Z	zykotick9	bogor	if you are using USB - it's gonna be VERY slow compared to IDE/SATA HDs...
2012-08-19T22:23:00.000Z	bogor		zykoticks9, Does pen drive connect other way or are you saying pen drives are slow since they connect via usb ?
2012-08-19T22:23:00.000Z	zykotick9		!tab > bogor
2012-08-19T22:23:00.000Z	bogor		ok
2012-08-19T22:23:00.000Z	zykotick9	bogor	USB is a slow interface
2012-08-19T22:26:00.000Z	bogor	zykotick9	so all pen drives are slow ? BTW tab completion is not working for me. Should i install any package ?
2012-08-19T22:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	bogor	i meant in IRC (you got my nic right this time).  Yes all USB drives will be slow compared to IDE/SATA (maybe not with USB3), very slow.
2012-08-19T22:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	bogor	bash-completion installed?  for bash.
2012-08-19T22:27:00.000Z	bogor		I will install bash-completion. Thanks
2012-08-19T22:31:00.000Z	bogor	zykotick9	bash-completion is awesome. Thanks
2012-08-19T22:33:00.000Z	bogor		The usb pen drive is new. But the PC is old so slow. I have a newer laptop. Will try making a large io like apt-get upgrade after this installation get over to see if there it is more usable.
2012-08-19T22:33:00.000Z	bogor		Does ubuntu installer have a log ?
2012-08-19T22:41:00.000Z	bogor		This may not be dir5ectly ubuntu related. But if usb is slow, what portable storage techology provides near or greater HDD speeds ?
2012-08-19T22:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	bogor	esata would be one option
2012-08-19T22:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	bogor	it makes me cry that i have to reboot to use esata on my mother board :(.. so i don't really get to use it.
2012-08-19T22:43:00.000Z	bogor	zykotick9	yeah i saw there is a esata port in my laptop. I will research. Thanks.
2012-08-19T22:43:00.000Z	zykotick9	bogor	i'm sure regular USB is your best bet - but it's slow... live with it ;)  it's handy
2012-08-19T22:44:00.000Z	bogor	zykotick9	i like usb. b'cos it is small and looks cool and comes in sufficent large capacity.
2012-08-19T22:45:00.000Z	bogor	zykotick9	just that it performance is not so good. I think situation will improve wth time. Maybe i need to wait.
2012-08-19T22:45:00.000Z	zykotick9	bogor	ya, nothing wrong with running from usb.  i personally just find it extremely slow for some things, and thus not sufficently fast (perhaps i'm spoiled by ssd os drive ;)
