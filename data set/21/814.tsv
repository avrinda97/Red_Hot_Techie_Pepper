2011-05-31T02:03:00.000Z	jmknsd		My laptop locked the screen and turned off the monitor (after I afked) and now when I move the mouse, nothing appears. Is there a way to fix this without restarting?
2011-05-31T02:03:00.000Z	nincompooop	jmknsd	well, did it go to standby?
2011-05-31T02:03:00.000Z	jmknsd	nincompooop	no
2011-05-31T02:03:00.000Z	jmknsd		I can still access the VTs
2011-05-31T02:03:00.000Z	nincompooop	jmknsd	alright, try pressing some buttons on the keyboar
2011-05-31T02:03:00.000Z	nincompooop		d
2011-05-31T02:04:00.000Z	jmknsd		did that, still nothing
2011-05-31T02:04:00.000Z	nincompooop	jmknsd	hmm...
2011-05-31T02:04:00.000Z	nincompooop	jmknsd	beat it with the force of two meteors colliding to teach it a lesson?
2011-05-31T02:05:00.000Z	jmknsd		It's a new laptop =(
2011-05-31T02:05:00.000Z	nincompooop	jmknsd	yeah, I guess restart's your best option then...
2011-05-31T02:05:00.000Z	nincompooop	jmknsd	or that...
2011-05-31T02:05:00.000Z	nincompooop		might work...
2011-05-31T02:05:00.000Z	jmknsd		It does
2011-05-31T02:05:00.000Z	jmknsd		I can go to VTs
2011-05-31T02:06:00.000Z	jmknsd		It is running
2011-05-31T02:06:00.000Z	jmknsd		I'd rather not, since this happens frequently
2011-05-31T02:06:00.000Z	jmknsd		I know restarting X fixes it
2011-05-31T02:07:00.000Z	jmknsd		In fact, I know I logged in, and I happened to be in IRC with that last one, and can see my input
2011-05-31T02:07:00.000Z	jmknsd		so, everything is still running, but my screen i black with a cursor
2011-05-31T02:07:00.000Z	nincompooop	jmknsd	sounds like an xscreensaver problem to be
