2009-07-10T02:18:00.000Z	Bookman		Is there no way to specify NFS as the share method for a directory in Nautilus?
2009-07-10T02:19:00.000Z	deany	Bookman	its a bit sad when you can select ssh, ftp, webdav and even samba and not the "linux prefered" nfs in nautilus
2009-07-10T02:19:00.000Z	Bookman	deany	exactly my point
2009-07-10T02:20:00.000Z	deany	Bookman	just man nfs and man export
2009-07-10T02:20:00.000Z	deany	Bookman	and set it up in fstab
2009-07-10T02:20:00.000Z	Bookman	deany	you have to go through command line hoops to make it work!
2009-07-10T02:22:00.000Z	Bookman	deany	I just hate to use a Windows protocol....might as well use Windows.  Defeats the purpose here.
2009-07-10T02:22:00.000Z	deany	Bookman	 google is your friend
2009-07-10T02:23:00.000Z	Bookman	deany	Yes, I can use google and use FTP....just doesn't seem native or easy.

2009-07-10T02:27:00.000Z	Bookman	deany	no, nfs is not easy or integrated.
2009-07-10T02:31:00.000Z	deany	Bookman	nfs is faster
2009-07-10T02:31:00.000Z	Bookman	deany	not what I said.  Easiest and most integrated by default.
2009-07-10T02:31:00.000Z	deany	Bookman	really its not that hard (says me who forgot most of it )
2009-07-10T02:31:00.000Z	deany	Bookman	ok then
2009-07-10T02:32:00.000Z	Bookman	deany	Thanks, thought so.  I appreciate the feedback.
2009-07-10T02:33:00.000Z	Bookman	deany	It's like pulling teeth to get someone to admit that!
2009-07-10T02:34:00.000Z	deany	Bookman	just add the share to /etc/exports and mount with mount command, or fstab.
2009-07-10T02:34:00.000Z	Bookman	deany	why?  Easier in Nautilus
2009-07-10T02:35:00.000Z	deany	Bookman	just thought you might wanna get familiar with something new.
2009-07-10T02:35:00.000Z	Bookman	deany	easy is best....just frustrated that windows is the best
