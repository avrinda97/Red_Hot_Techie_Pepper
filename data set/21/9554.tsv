2005-09-01T16:21:00.000Z	Jowi	brownie17	sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
2005-09-01T16:23:00.000Z	Jowi	brownie17	sudo (admin) nano (texteditor) /boot/grub/(directory)menu.lst(grub boot menu file)
2005-09-01T16:24:00.000Z	Jowi	brownie17	nano is a texteditor. to edit your grub boot file (the one you see at startup of your computer) run the following command: sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst - that was what you asked for.
2005-09-01T16:25:00.000Z	brownie17	Jowi	where do i get nano
2005-09-01T16:25:00.000Z	Jowi	brownie17	do you have Ubuntu installed on your PC?
2005-09-01T16:28:00.000Z	brownie17	Jowi	i went to the Grub editor thing, but there is no text in the document, just a header and the keyboard shortcuts
2005-09-01T16:28:00.000Z	Jowi	brownie17	ahhhhh, that makes sence. hmmm.. makes it a tad more complex.
2005-09-01T16:29:00.000Z	brownie17	Jowi	can we do a private chat, where there are not lots of other people?
2005-09-01T16:37:00.000Z	Jowi	brownie17	when someone asks you to use pastebin to make sure you don't flood the channel. do it. paste.ubuntulinux.nl
