2009-03-12T16:18:00.000Z	nightdrever		and i dont know how to find the gdipluss.dll and put in my wine directory
2009-03-12T16:20:00.000Z	nightdrever		did it install fine?/
2009-03-12T16:21:00.000Z	nightdrever		i cant get mine too
2009-03-12T16:22:00.000Z	nightdrever		hmm?? extract the zipp file where? and how do you  open it?
2009-03-12T16:23:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	any folder should do.. I extracted it to ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/
2009-03-12T16:14:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	do you get some kind of error message?
2009-03-12T16:16:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	looking at the ubuntu forums thread it seems they've had some success by copying a "gdiplus.dll" into your wine system folder.. have you tried that?
2009-03-12T16:17:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	also try downloading the zip file instead of the installer.. might work better
2009-03-12T16:20:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	well.. I'm running babaschess right now.. using the zipped version and wine 1.1.16... seems to work fine
2009-03-12T16:21:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	I didn't have to install it.. I just extracted the zip file
2009-03-12T16:33:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	you could try the advice given here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1009474
2009-03-12T16:45:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	did you copy a real gdiplus.dll into your wine system32 folder?
2009-03-12T16:46:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	no worries.. just wait a second and I'll help you
2009-03-12T16:49:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	ok... you can download gdiplus.dll from this site http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?gdiplus . I can't guarantee that it isn't filled with viruses and nasty things but I've tried it on my computer and I'm still alive
2009-03-12T16:50:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	yes.. you extract it to /home/<yourusername>/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32
2009-03-12T16:51:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	press ctrl+h to find the .wine folder, it's hidden by default
2009-03-12T16:53:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	then I don't know.. I'm not sure what the pieces are supposed to look like but as far as I can tell my pieces are normal
2009-03-12T16:54:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	you did restart babaschess?
2009-03-12T16:55:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	if you write "wine --version" in a terminal, what does it say?
2009-03-12T16:56:00.000Z	Slart	nightdrever	ah.. good
