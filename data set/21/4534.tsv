2010-09-16T13:39:00.000Z	yareckon		hmmm works fine for me
2010-09-16T13:40:00.000Z	yareckon		there is really absolutely no reason to install a 32 bit ubuntu any more if you have a high horsepower proc
2010-09-16T13:40:00.000Z	yareckon		I have 32 bit on the macbook air, cause it will never go over 2 GB ram
2010-09-16T13:40:00.000Z	yareckon		but for everthing else 64 bit has hardly and compatibility issues
