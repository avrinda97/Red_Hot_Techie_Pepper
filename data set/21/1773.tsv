2010-05-15T21:20:00.000Z	Narya		how do I open .bin files?
2010-05-15T21:20:00.000Z	coz_	Narya	  first right click the file go to properties
2010-05-15T21:21:00.000Z	coz_	Narya	 then the Permissions tab  and tick the "Execute"   box
2010-05-15T21:21:00.000Z	coz_	Narya	 then open a terminal...cd to that location  and  run   ./nameof.bin
2010-05-15T21:22:00.000Z	coz_	Narya	  ooo   you should be able to just drag that onto firefox window  I believe
2010-05-15T21:24:00.000Z	Narya	coz_	that's what happened
2010-05-15T21:24:00.000Z	Narya	coz_	dragging it into firefox just caused to to redownload somehow...
2010-05-15T21:24:00.000Z	coz_	Narya	  that pastebin is empty
2010-05-15T21:25:00.000Z	coz_	Narya	  did you  open firefox  go to  "Tools"   then  "Addons"   and search for that plugin  on their site?
2010-05-15T21:25:00.000Z	Narya	coz_	http://pastebin.com/EafXaSMb
2010-05-15T21:26:00.000Z	coz_	Narya	  ok  in that pastebin I see you used  "run"   no need   just type    ./AdbeRd  and hit the tab button to complete the name
2010-05-15T21:28:00.000Z	coz_	Narya	  so I assume this .bin is on the desktop  so open terminal    type     cd  Desktop   then type  ./Ad   hit tab  to complete name  and then hit enter
2010-05-15T21:28:00.000Z	Narya	coz_	somehow it was already installed even though firefox said it wasnt
2010-05-15T21:29:00.000Z	Narya	coz_	started up firefox again and there it was
2010-05-15T21:29:00.000Z	coz_	Narya	 mm  that's interesting
2010-05-15T21:29:00.000Z	Narya	coz_	I agree
2010-05-15T21:29:00.000Z	coz_	Narya	  ok   I would guess the best way to install firefox plugins is through the  Tools/addons  menu
2010-05-15T21:29:00.000Z	Narya	coz_	I guess so
2010-05-15T21:29:00.000Z	coz_	Narya	   go to their site and search for the plugins you want  and they install from there
2010-05-15T21:30:00.000Z	Narya	coz_	ok Ill do that from now :) thanks
2010-05-15T21:30:00.000Z	coz_	Narya	 no problem...
