2009-09-29T04:46:00.000Z	funkyHat	W0rmDr1nk	fair enough. it's printing ^C brcause that's the signal it receives from the keyboard

2009-09-29T04:49:00.000Z	funkyHat	W0rmDr1nk	not sure, I didn't know it wasn't doing it (I actually use zsh, not bas, anyway)
2009-09-29T04:49:00.000Z	funkyHat		*bash
2009-09-29T04:49:00.000Z	funkyHat	W0rmDr1nk	you could file a bug if it bothers you
