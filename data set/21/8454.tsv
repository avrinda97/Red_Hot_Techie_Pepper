2006-04-01T07:24:00.000Z	tanuki		can someone tell me why i cannot play mp3 files in rhythymbox?
2006-04-01T07:25:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	visit the wiki page ubotu just said
2006-04-01T07:26:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	in a terminal do 'sudo aptitude install gstreamer0.8-mad' and paste the command and output on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and give us a link
2006-04-01T07:28:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	are you using dapper or breezy?
2006-04-01T07:29:00.000Z	tanuki	_jason	i am using dapper dan i believe
2006-04-01T07:30:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	put your /etc/apt/sources.list on pastebin
2006-04-01T07:32:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	interesting, try 'sudo apt-get update' and then installing again.  If it still doesn't work, you'll have to visit #ubuntu+1 as that is the dapper channel anyway and they will know more
2006-04-01T07:33:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	wait, I see a problem in your /etc/apt/sources.list.  Does your line 30 really contain '$' like that?
2006-04-01T07:34:00.000Z	tanuki	_jason	no, it does not.
2006-04-01T07:35:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	k, try #ubuntu+1 then
2006-04-01T08:08:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	#ubuntu+1 for dapper
2006-04-01T08:21:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	heh did you get that mp3 thing sorted, I just looked at your /etc/apt/sources.list as I was closing it and realized you are using breezy, not ``dapper dan'' :)
2006-04-01T08:57:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	see what ubotu said above about icons ^
2006-04-01T09:08:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	did you install gstreamer0.8-mad?
2006-04-01T09:09:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	close rhythmbox, run gst-register-0.8, and try rhythmbox again
2006-04-01T09:11:00.000Z	tanuki	_jason	k, i got it to work
2006-04-01T09:11:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	great
2006-04-15T09:40:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	it means you don't have permission
2006-04-15T09:41:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	first, you make sure that you know what you are doing so you don't break anything, then you can use 'sudo'
2006-04-15T09:42:00.000Z	tanuki	_jason	actually i am installing a program, a dynamic ip update client, and when i used the make install command as instructed in the readme i got that error
2006-04-15T09:43:00.000Z	_jason	tanuki	use checkinstall instead, install checkinstall with apt, and then you use 'sudo checkinstall' instead of make install
