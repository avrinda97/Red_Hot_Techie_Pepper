2009-05-29T20:21:00.000Z	holyguyver		How do I do a forced unmount
2009-05-29T20:22:00.000Z	sipior	holyguyver	yes, if you're just changing the volume name. still, you have backups, right?
2009-05-29T20:22:00.000Z	holyguyver	sipior	there is no way I can back up it as I do not have 1Tb to back it up onto
2009-05-29T20:23:00.000Z	sipior	holyguyver	if it's not backed up, don't mess with it.
2009-05-29T20:23:00.000Z	sipior	holyguyver	terabyte disks are cheap these days, btw.
2009-05-29T20:23:00.000Z	holyguyver	sipior	so you are saying that the contents will not be safe?
2009-05-29T20:24:00.000Z	holyguyver	sipior	100$ is not cheap if you have no job & live alone on your own money
2009-05-29T20:24:00.000Z	sipior	holyguyver	no, i'm saying it's almost certainly safe. but if something goes wrong, what will you do?
2009-05-29T20:27:00.000Z	sipior	holyguyver	also, you were able to afford the first disk, consider making some sort of backup a priority, to insure your current investment.
2009-05-29T20:27:00.000Z	holyguyver	sipior	I got the first disk as a christmas gift 2 years ago
2009-05-29T20:27:00.000Z	sipior	holyguyver	well, christmas is coming.
2009-05-29T20:28:00.000Z	holyguyver	sipior	well that doesn't do me much good if I would like to do the relabeling at this moment :p
2009-05-29T20:28:00.000Z	sipior	holyguyver	is it so urgent?
2009-05-29T20:29:00.000Z	holyguyver	sipior	no, but I would rather do it now & take the risk
2009-05-29T21:03:00.000Z	holyguyver	sipior	Alright I relabeled it & everything is fine :) .
2009-05-29T21:04:00.000Z	sipior	holyguyver	good. remember, disks fail all the time. if you get complacent about it, it will come back to bite you. some friendly advice, acquired through painful experience.
2009-05-29T21:06:00.000Z	holyguyver	sipior	thanks but I have delt with this before. See my previous 1tb disk died & I spent 2,600 to have it professionally recovered.
2009-05-29T21:06:00.000Z	sipior	holyguyver	and you're worried about dropping a hundred quid on a new disk? uh...okay :-)
2009-05-29T21:06:00.000Z	holyguyver	sipior	that was a few years ago, I had the money at that time :p
