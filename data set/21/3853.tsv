2008-09-07T01:40:00.000Z	fixedy		gnea: uh, the problem is that it's not my primary master
2008-09-07T01:40:00.000Z	Gnea	fixedy	that doesn't matter, grub doesn't care, as long as it's installed somewhere
2008-09-07T01:40:00.000Z	fixedy		gnea: ok then, I'll do that
2008-09-07T01:41:00.000Z	Gnea	fixedy	you can take a hard drive that ubuntu is on and install it in any computer, on any chain, and it will simply 'work' because it doesn't care what the primary/secondary is anymore :)
2008-09-07T01:43:00.000Z	fixedy		gnea: how do I find out which hd the maxtor is (i.e. hd0)
2008-09-07T01:43:00.000Z	fixedy		gnea: is it the same as sdd?
2008-09-07T01:44:00.000Z	Gnea	fixedy	it's going to be the second one, and grub always knows the first to be (hd0), the second to be (hd1), and so on...
2008-09-07T01:44:00.000Z	Gnea	fixedy	the only thing that won't work right is grub configuration menu - that will need to be editted later, but you can get around it in the meantime
2008-09-07T01:47:00.000Z	fixedy	Gnea	Error 17: Cannot mount selected partition (my command:  setup (hd1))
2008-09-07T01:47:00.000Z	Gnea	fixedy	were you able to set the root correctly?
2008-09-07T01:48:00.000Z	fixedy		gnea: yes.
2008-09-07T01:49:00.000Z	Gnea	fixedy	weird.... can you disconnect IBM and boot the livecd and do it from there?
2008-09-07T01:50:00.000Z	fixedy		gnea: I could try, yes
2008-09-07T01:50:00.000Z	Gnea	fixedy	okay
2008-09-07T01:59:00.000Z	Gnea		!grub | fixedz
2008-09-07T02:01:00.000Z	fixedy		gnea: find: /boot/grub: No such file or directory
2008-09-07T02:03:00.000Z	Gnea	fixedy	make sure your root is set correctly
2008-09-07T02:03:00.000Z	fixedy		gnea: found the problem, forgot to go to grub, sorrz
2008-09-07T02:04:00.000Z	Gnea	fixedy	np
2008-09-07T02:05:00.000Z	fixedy		gnea: ok, grub is installed, am rebooting
2008-09-07T02:09:00.000Z	Gnea	fixedy	cool
