2005-04-22T10:04:00.000Z	LISP		it can divide the package and retrieve them? as a down accel?
2005-04-22T10:04:00.000Z	LISP		have to look it up in man
2005-04-22T10:05:00.000Z	LISP		thorea: i know
2005-04-22T10:05:00.000Z	LISP		thorea: but don't know them all :P
2005-04-22T10:05:00.000Z	LISP		thorea: if anyone knows all the options for tar i'm willing to eat my monitor ;)
2005-04-22T10:06:00.000Z	LISP		thorea: EXCEPT THE DEVELOPER :d
2005-04-22T10:06:00.000Z	LISP		:D
2005-04-22T10:07:00.000Z	LISP		thorea: bash is good too ;)
2005-04-22T10:07:00.000Z	LISP		is it true that x uses max 24b of color?
2005-04-22T10:07:00.000Z	LISP		i thought they were 24 plus the implicit 8 of transp
2005-04-22T10:08:00.000Z	mjg59	LISP	Currently, yes. Once there's more hardware supporting stuff like 36 bit colour, that may change
2005-04-22T10:08:00.000Z	mjg59	LISP	There's up to 32 bits of data per pixel. Only 24 bits of that are colour.
2005-04-22T10:08:00.000Z	LISP		mgj59: i know the theory
2005-04-22T10:09:00.000Z	LISP		mgj59: just wanted to know if x was using other terminology
2005-04-22T10:09:00.000Z	mjg59		X supports 32 bits per pixel, but not 32 bits of colour per pixel
2005-04-22T10:09:00.000Z	LISP		mgj59: because win includes the transparency
2005-04-22T10:09:00.000Z	mjg59		So it'll be defined as 24 bit colour even if you're using 32 bits per pixel
2005-04-22T10:09:00.000Z	LISP		mgj59: i knew that
2005-04-22T10:09:00.000Z	LISP		was unsure if x was using 16 for color and 8 for transp
2005-04-22T10:10:00.000Z	LISP	mjg59	win says 32b for color, and i'm sure they're cheating :P
2005-04-22T10:11:00.000Z	LISP	mjg59	txh for clearing it though
