2007-12-27T08:25:00.000Z	Shpook	tanath	is it miro that's not working?
2007-12-27T08:25:00.000Z	tanath	Shpook	yep
2007-12-27T08:26:00.000Z	Shpook	tanath	it didn't work for me when I recently installed from the repos. I had to download from www.getmiro.com
2007-12-27T08:26:00.000Z	Shpook	tanath	if it helps at all lol
2007-12-27T08:26:00.000Z	tanath	Shpook	hm... i guess i'll try that, though i prefer to use the repo versions. :/
2007-12-27T08:28:00.000Z	tanath	Shpook	jimmygoon, ah they have their own repo for gutsy...
2007-12-27T08:29:00.000Z	Shpook	tanath	oh...i didnt know that.
2007-12-27T08:30:00.000Z	tanath	Shpook	apparently i did... it's already there... :/
2007-12-27T08:31:00.000Z	Shpook	tanath	well good, now that I know I'm going to add the repo. Automatic upgrades are nice. :-)
2007-12-27T08:32:00.000Z	tanath	Shpook	actually, that could be what's causing the prob
2007-12-27T08:33:00.000Z	tanath	Shpook	er, on the other hand, despite the fact that i have the repo in there, when i reinstall miro it pulls it from the gutsy repo
2007-12-27T08:34:00.000Z	Shpook	tanath	I think I read one time a way to give certain repos priority if multiple repos contain the same package
2007-12-27T08:34:00.000Z	tanath	Shpook	erm, nvm... i just updated & now it's pulling it from the miro repo... will let you know if it works
2007-12-27T08:34:00.000Z	Shpook	tanath	okay, ty
2007-12-27T08:35:00.000Z	tanath	Shpook	you can do that in synaptic easy enough. Ctrl+E on the pkg
2007-12-27T08:35:00.000Z	tanath	Shpook	woohoo, it appears to be working :D
2007-12-27T08:36:00.000Z	tanath	Shpook	the miro repo version
2007-12-27T08:36:00.000Z	Shpook	tanath	ctrl-e is much easier lol.
2007-12-27T08:37:00.000Z	Shpook	tanath	good! repo it is then. :-)
2007-12-27T08:38:00.000Z	tanath	Shpook	yep, working fine now.  and i find ctrl+e handy. instead of messing with priorities you just 'force version' for whichever package you want, it synaptic/apt handles the rest
2007-12-27T08:39:00.000Z	Shpook	tanath	goodnight.
