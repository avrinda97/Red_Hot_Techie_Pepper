2011-01-28T07:07:00.000Z	niles	ChipCherou	I can fix this, one sec
2011-01-28T07:10:00.000Z	niles	ChipCherou	boot while holding shift, select recovery mode, at the recovery menu select netroot, type root password, su usertologinas, startx, right click, create folder, open that folder, navigate to /usr/share/applications, double click Terminal, put screen -S unity
2011-01-28T07:10:00.000Z	niles	ChipCherou	type unity, hit enter
2011-01-28T07:11:00.000Z	niles	ChipCherou	close the terminal, if it says its not installed, try gnome-panel
2011-01-28T07:11:00.000Z	ChipCherou	niles	rebooting now to try...its pretty messed up
2011-01-28T07:12:00.000Z	niles	ChipCherou	you have to manually start ssh and apache2 with the commands "service apache2 start" and "/etc/init.d/ssh start" respectively
2011-01-28T07:14:00.000Z	ChipCherou	niles	when you say recovery ode...do you mean when selecting kernel?
2011-01-28T07:16:00.000Z	ChipCherou	niles	I don't think what you told me will work
2011-01-28T07:18:00.000Z	ChipCherou	niles	normal boot will get me to the login screen but wont give me the fields to login.  recovery mode gets as far as mounting swap successfully then sits.  in both case ctrl+alt+del sucessfully shuts down
2011-01-28T07:18:00.000Z	niles	ChipCherou	I would say your screwed but keep looking
2011-01-28T07:21:00.000Z	niles	ChipCherou	yes
2011-01-28T07:21:00.000Z	niles	ChipCherou	you would lose all not-backed-up data
2011-01-28T07:23:00.000Z	ChipCherou	niles	nope... its not freezing...its like it does have the bash files anymore
2011-01-28T07:23:00.000Z	ChipCherou	niles	*doesn't
2011-01-28T07:23:00.000Z	niles	ChipCherou	reinstall ubuntu
2011-01-28T07:24:00.000Z	ChipCherou	niles	I was hoping to run live disk and continue update from wher eit left off
2011-01-28T07:24:00.000Z	ChipCherou	niles	is that possible?
2011-01-28T07:24:00.000Z	niles	ChipCherou	I dont think so
