2006-05-25T08:03:00.000Z	soundray	premier69	what kind of machine do you have, and what do you want to to with it?
2006-05-25T08:05:00.000Z	premier69	soundray	i was thinking of using it as a standard desktop OS instead of xp for surfing, checking mail and working in some sort of office equivelent
2006-05-25T08:06:00.000Z	soundray	premier69	any machine that runs Windows XP satisfactorily will work with Ubuntu. You should have 256MB RAM or more for it to work okay.
2006-05-25T08:07:00.000Z	premier69	soundray	it doesnt really run xp very well and the previous windows are a bit too old thats why i was thinking of a GUI linux distro like ubuntu or xandros
2006-05-25T08:08:00.000Z	soundray	premier69	the Gnome desktop does require a lot of resources, but you have a choice of less expensive desktop environments.
2006-05-25T08:09:00.000Z	premier69	soundray	how does gnome compare to kde?
2006-05-25T08:10:00.000Z	soundray	premier69	this is flamewar material. You have to check it out for yourself to see what you prefer.
2006-05-25T08:11:00.000Z	soundray	premier69	FWIW, I like kde because it lets me tweak everything, but I use gnome because I end up spending more time working and less time tweaking ;)
2006-05-25T08:11:00.000Z	premier69	soundray	thanks for your input
2006-05-25T08:24:00.000Z	soundray	premier69	in the title bar, click the third button from the right
2006-05-25T08:29:00.000Z	soundray	premier69	System-Preferences-Window, select Titlebar Action Roll up
2006-05-25T08:31:00.000Z	premier69	soundray	how does one shade a window in ubuntu, like xandros?
2006-05-25T08:31:00.000Z	soundray	premier69	have you tried my suggestion?
2006-05-25T08:31:00.000Z	soundray	premier69	no, kubuntu uses kde
2006-05-25T08:33:00.000Z	soundray	premier69	System-Preferences-Window, select Titlebar Action Roll up
2006-05-25T08:39:00.000Z	premier69	soundray	can i bother you with a rather lengthy question about network settings?
2006-05-25T08:39:00.000Z	soundray	premier69	ask the channel. If someone here knows, they will try to answer.
2006-05-25T08:40:00.000Z	premier69	soundray	sure will
2006-05-25T08:47:00.000Z	soundray	premier69	it sounds like you need to configure WinXP to accept DHCP requests from your ubuntu/xandros machines.
2006-05-25T08:50:00.000Z	soundray	premier69	if that is so, it's probably just Windows being mean this way. It's really a Windows support question, though.
