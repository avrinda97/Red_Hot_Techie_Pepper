2007-11-17T02:59:00.000Z	rdpb		hi to all
2007-11-17T02:59:00.000Z	rdpb		did someone have a kubuntu install in raid 0 sata disks? or to stop trying..?
2007-11-17T03:01:00.000Z	rdpb		i suppose that im not very good on this i cant make it working
2007-11-17T03:03:00.000Z	Henkie	rdpb	try using dodmraid on the kernel boot promtp
2007-11-17T03:04:00.000Z	Henkie	rdpb	dont install on it, unless it's really hw raid
2007-11-17T03:06:00.000Z	Henkie	rdpb	hmm, really depends on the make, normally the sw raid is capable of raid 0 or raid 1
2007-11-17T03:09:00.000Z	Henkie	rdpb	linux normally bypasses the bios
2007-11-17T03:17:00.000Z	Henkie	rdpb	yes  :)
2007-11-17T03:19:00.000Z	Henkie	rdpb	real raid is done in hardware with expensive hardware
2007-11-17T03:19:00.000Z	Henkie	rdpb	yes, and onboard ram
2007-11-17T03:26:00.000Z	rdpb	Henkie	you mean do take out the raid?
2007-11-17T03:20:00.000Z	Henkie	rdpb	it will take some reading, and understanding
2007-11-17T03:21:00.000Z	Henkie	rdpb	those motherboards are kinda faking it
2007-11-17T03:23:00.000Z	Henkie	rdpb	i am not sure about ubuntu but i dont think there is a easy
2007-11-17T03:24:00.000Z	rdpb	Henkie	you mean with other distribution?
2007-11-17T03:25:00.000Z	Henkie	rdpb	dont know about them, but i would recommend againt using the motherboard-raid
2007-11-17T03:26:00.000Z	Henkie	rdpb	yes, at least from your bios's perspective, and using the sw-raid from linux itself
2007-11-17T03:28:00.000Z	rdpb	Henkie	and what about windows?
2007-11-17T03:29:00.000Z	Henkie	rdpb	dont know enough about windows, but the raid is still done from software
2007-11-17T03:30:00.000Z	rdpb	Henkie	i mean that if do linux raid sw then i cant have access from windows right?
2007-11-17T03:30:00.000Z	Henkie	rdpb	sorry, yes  :)  (you cant access it)
