2008-01-03T03:07:00.000Z	teddy__		Hi, I'm getting started with shell scripting. May I say that bash is the same as /bin/sh?
2008-01-03T03:08:00.000Z	tomgg	teddy__	they should be similar enough for most scripting purposes
2008-01-03T03:10:00.000Z	tomgg	teddy__	i would have thought #! /bin/sh would be more standard across oses, then it can use any shell
2008-01-03T03:11:00.000Z	teddy__	tomgg	this is the idea. But Ubuntu substituted it with dash for efficiency
2008-01-03T03:11:00.000Z	tomgg	teddy__	yea and dash should be ok, its just when some non standard bash extensions are used in scripts they dont work with sh
2008-01-03T03:13:00.000Z	tomgg	teddy__	it works for me in bash and dash
2008-01-03T03:13:00.000Z	teddy__	tomgg	yes, but not with #! /bin/sh
2008-01-03T03:13:00.000Z	tomgg	teddy__	run this  ls -l /bin/sh
2008-01-03T03:14:00.000Z	teddy__	tomgg	links to dash
2008-01-03T03:14:00.000Z	tomgg	teddy__	what output do u get from your script in dash?
2008-01-03T03:15:00.000Z	teddy__	tomgg	do you mean as #! /bin/dash?
2008-01-03T03:15:00.000Z	tomgg	teddy__	either that or /bin/sh, as they should be the same
2008-01-03T03:16:00.000Z	tomgg	teddy__	?
2008-01-03T03:16:00.000Z	teddy__	tomgg	sorry, I was trying.
2008-01-03T03:16:00.000Z	tomgg	teddy__	no worries, what output do u get?
2008-01-03T03:16:00.000Z	teddy__	tomgg	it's actually working also with #! /bin/sh -
2008-01-03T03:17:00.000Z	tomgg	teddy__	lol so no problem then?
2008-01-03T03:17:00.000Z	teddy__	tomgg	I get as output: 2
2008-01-03T03:17:00.000Z	teddy__	tomgg	yes, it's working fine. Probably a typo. Pheew, at least I can keep studying :-)
2008-01-03T03:18:00.000Z	tomgg	teddy__	lol gdgd
2008-01-03T03:18:00.000Z	teddy__	tomgg	Bye and thanks.
