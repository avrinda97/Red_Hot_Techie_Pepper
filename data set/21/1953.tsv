2010-06-29T17:46:00.000Z	toyotafosgate		Any ideas why I might have a installation fail of Ubuntu Server 10.04 while trying to setup a simple raid 1 setup?
2010-06-29T17:47:00.000Z	toyotafosgate		Basically getting the following errors went it boots up:

2010-06-29T17:48:00.000Z	DarkStar1	toyotafosgate	use pastebin to post the error message

2010-06-29T17:52:00.000Z	DarkStar1	toyotafosgate	Is this a repetitive problem?? (as in have you tried a re-install?)
2010-06-29T17:53:00.000Z	toyotafosgate	DarkStar1	yes, I have actually tried differents setups with raid but they all seem to fail. I can install on one drive but raid seems to keep failing
2010-06-29T17:54:00.000Z	toyotafosgate	DarkStar1	It seems almost like the raid setup is not completely being erased and causing it to not boot correctly, either that or something is being messed up in Grub
2010-06-29T17:54:00.000Z	DarkStar1	toyotafosgate	The problem is probably down to your raid card. Had this problem a while back when Sata first came out and my friend and I were using a custom RAID card
2010-06-29T17:55:00.000Z	toyotafosgate	DarkStar1	see that's the thing the server I am using is an older HP DL140 and it only has IDE, I am trying to use the built in installer with mdadm to setup software raid
2010-06-29T17:56:00.000Z	DarkStar1	toyotafosgate	Aahh you're complicating your problem... my experience with software RAID on Linux is that the grey hair strands aren't worth the effort
2010-06-29T17:57:00.000Z	toyotafosgate	DarkStar1	It's odd because I used the same setup on another server with the exact same hardware and it worked correctly. I am not sure what could be the problem...
2010-06-29T17:58:00.000Z	DarkStar1	toyotafosgate	Hang on I'm trying to picture where your setup is going wrong
2010-06-29T17:58:00.000Z	toyotafosgate	DarkStar1	ok thanks
2010-06-29T17:59:00.000Z	toyotafosgate	DarkStar1	Some more info, it seems like it is trying to load that /dev/md1p2 but I am only creating to raid devices, MD0 and MD1... Why does this even exist?
2010-06-29T17:59:00.000Z	toyotafosgate	DarkStar1	correction "two" raid devices
2010-06-29T18:00:00.000Z	DarkStar1	toyotafosgate	Is there a partitionon one of your hard drives?
2010-06-29T18:01:00.000Z	toyotafosgate	DarkStar1	Before installing I removed all partitions and raid devices from within the installer. Is that what you mean?
2010-06-29T18:05:00.000Z	toyotafosgate	DarkStar1	do you need any more information from me?
2010-06-29T18:08:00.000Z	DarkStar1	toyotafosgate	You see the private chat window messages?
