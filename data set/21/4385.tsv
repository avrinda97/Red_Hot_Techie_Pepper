2008-05-05T15:44:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	rockets	join the club.
2008-05-05T15:44:00.000Z	rockets	mad_at_wifi	i have to use b43 for my wifi. its total crap.
2008-05-05T15:45:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	rockets	b43 here too. what were they thinking when they made the card. b43 = broadcom
2008-05-05T15:45:00.000Z	rockets	mad_at_wifi	its not the card. its the linux drivers. i have no problems with the card on windows. b43 is just junk.
2008-05-05T15:46:00.000Z	rockets	mad_at_wifi	dont get me wrong, i appreciate the effort behind b43. but how about making something that doesnt totally suck :-P
2008-05-05T15:46:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	rockets	that's because the card is a hack to work with windows and apparently does not do things the standard way.
2008-05-05T15:46:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	rockets	I agree but I will NOT complain about things that I haven't contributed @ all.
2008-05-05T15:46:00.000Z	rockets	mad_at_wifi	there are plenty of good excuses for why the card doesnt work right. but the fact is, it still doesnt work rightm no matter how good your excuse is.
2008-05-05T15:46:00.000Z	rockets	mad_at_wifi	well, i guess we're different in that way :-P
2008-05-05T15:48:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	rockets	I am willing to flame broadcom for this. Then again they can jus say that they never intended to support lin. I am guessing that with companies slapping them on the bottom with money is the only way to go.
2008-05-05T15:48:00.000Z	rockets	mad_at_wifi	yeah, broadcoms only responsibility in this is that they refuse to release the specs for their cards. but that's their right I guess. Intel Wifi ftw.
2008-05-05T15:49:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	rockets	I used RT25XX series without any problem. I like them
2008-05-05T15:51:00.000Z	rockets	mad_at_wifi	i hear aetheros cards work the best on linux. but i dont know first hand.
2008-05-05T15:52:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	rockets	yes, I heard the same. Problem with this is that I did not know what chip I will get while ordering the laptop. Besides there is not much choice in this case.
2008-05-05T15:52:00.000Z	rockets	mad_at_wifi	yeah. but you can tell with some brands. lenovo thinkpads give you a choice of what wifi you want, including intel, which is always a good choice.
2008-05-05T15:53:00.000Z	rockets	mad_at_wifi	i mean, ultimately you can make anything work, at least via ndiswrapper. but the question is how well.
2008-05-05T15:53:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	rockets	then again I do not like the Thinkpads. Guess we cannot have everything we want :(. In this case, we cannot have a laptop that works just find.
2008-05-05T15:54:00.000Z	rockets	mad_at_wifi	you could always buy a laptop from a company that makes linux laptops
2008-05-05T15:54:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	rockets	I am using fwcutter and it was pretty simple to get things working. Only problem was the actual netwok setup. I think it is a bug with network manager util
2008-05-05T15:54:00.000Z	rockets	mad_at_wifi	i agree. fwcutter is very easy to set up. but i randomly cant connect to certain networks, no matter what i try. oddly enough, WPA networks are the easiest to get working.
