2010-06-10T08:20:00.000Z	turtle-man		I'm trying to install a SATA hard drive with a PCI adapter
2010-06-10T08:20:00.000Z	turtle-man		should i be looking for the drive in lshw?
2010-06-10T08:20:00.000Z	edbian	turtle-man	It should show up there.  lshw "lists hardware"
2010-06-10T08:21:00.000Z	turtle-man	edbian	and if it doesn't? where should i start looking for problems?
2010-06-10T08:21:00.000Z	edbian	turtle-man	You could make double sure by running sudo lshw -C disk
2010-06-10T08:21:00.000Z	edbian	turtle-man	which is obvious...
2010-06-10T08:22:00.000Z	edbian	turtle-man	good
2010-06-10T08:22:00.000Z	edbian	turtle-man	Now, does it show up in sudo fdisk -l ?
2010-06-10T08:23:00.000Z	turtle-man	edbian	what does fdisk do?
2010-06-10T08:23:00.000Z	edbian	turtle-man	It's a command line utility to partition drives. fdisk -l just lists all of them.  It will show us if the system sees your device as a harddrive and is using it as such.
2010-06-10T08:24:00.000Z	turtle-man	edbian	okay, because the drive is already formated to ext3. it was in one of my other computers. I'll try said command :P
2010-06-10T08:25:00.000Z	edbian	turtle-man	I don't want to format it either.  It is a good idea because it will show that the system recognizes it as a HDD
2010-06-10T08:25:00.000Z	turtle-man	edbian	next step is mounting?
2010-06-10T08:26:00.000Z	edbian	turtle-man	yes.  Did it show up there?
2010-06-10T08:26:00.000Z	turtle-man	edbian	sure did. sdc1
2010-06-10T08:26:00.000Z	edbian	turtle-man	Does it show up in places -> computer?
2010-06-10T08:26:00.000Z	turtle-man	edbian	I'm actually using crunchbang 9.04 :P
2010-06-10T08:27:00.000Z	edbian	turtle-man	awesome! :) Do you not have places -> computer?
2010-06-10T08:28:00.000Z	edbian	turtle-man	then you need to PM me and we can finish but I don't want to clog up the ubuntu channel with it.
2010-06-10T08:28:00.000Z	turtle-man	edbian	not that has a list of drives... i've mounted sdb1 to media/disk/
2010-06-10T08:28:00.000Z	edbian	turtle-man	Then you're done! ?
