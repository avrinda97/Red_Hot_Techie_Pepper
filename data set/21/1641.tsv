2010-07-12T16:13:00.000Z	nobarking		some keeps breaking into my wireless router, how can i monitor the traffic?
2010-07-12T16:13:00.000Z	nobarking		is there such software in ubuntu?
2010-07-12T16:14:00.000Z	airtonix	nobarking	stop using wep
2010-07-12T16:15:00.000Z	airtonix	nobarking	it's a fairly simple operation... stop using WEP. use wpa2 instead
2010-07-12T16:15:00.000Z	nobarking	airtonix	my router is old
2010-07-12T16:15:00.000Z	airtonix	nobarking	then you're out of luck
2010-07-12T16:16:00.000Z	airtonix	nobarking	unless your router allows you to whitelist mac addresses
2010-07-12T16:16:00.000Z	airtonix	nobarking	the other thing i tell my friends to do (who insist on using wifi) is to turn off dhcp and use static ips in non standard ip ranges
2010-07-12T16:18:00.000Z	airtonix	nobarking	yes
2010-07-12T16:19:00.000Z	airtonix	nobarking	you'll also need a separate device for the wifi access point and internet access
2010-07-12T16:19:00.000Z	airtonix	nobarking	i assume your internet access device is the same thing as your wifi device ?
2010-07-12T16:20:00.000Z	airtonix	nobarking	are they the same device ?
2010-07-12T16:20:00.000Z	airtonix	nobarking	i would just check first to see if your wlan router allows you to whitelist wifi clients by mac address
2010-07-12T16:21:00.000Z	nobarking	airtonix	thanks, i think i saw an option. i'll try that...
2010-07-12T16:21:00.000Z	airtonix	nobarking	also
2010-07-12T16:22:00.000Z	airtonix	nobarking	you may have an option to broadcast the AP name... turn that off to make the accesspoint invisible.
2010-07-12T16:22:00.000Z	nobarking	airtonix	will the invisibility prevent legitimate users also?
2010-07-12T16:23:00.000Z	airtonix	nobarking	it will weed out the nubs. whitelisting will prevent machines that you don't allow to connect
2010-07-12T16:24:00.000Z	airtonix	nobarking	i would also think about getting a new wifi router (they are fairly cheap now)
2010-07-12T16:24:00.000Z	nobarking	airtonix	yeah, i think i'll probably go ahead and do that
2010-07-12T16:28:00.000Z	airtonix	nobarking	well calling your access point a router is flimsy concept
