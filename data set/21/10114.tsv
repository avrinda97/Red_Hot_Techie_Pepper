2005-05-19T10:29:00.000Z	metalsand		Over the 7 years I used Windows, the MOST I had to do was download a driver and click install
2005-05-19T10:30:00.000Z	metalsand		The first 5 hours in Ubuntu I spent configuring my laptops resolution. Eventually someone told me I needed a package to "trick" my monitor into displaing those settings
2005-05-19T10:30:00.000Z	metalsand		My hardware is top of the line: both my monitor and my card
2005-05-19T10:31:00.000Z	metalsand		Both worked perfectly in Windows, and both worked perfectly for ever 700m user.
2005-05-19T10:32:00.000Z	metalsand		Don't get upset, I'm just tyring to give you another opinion.
2005-05-19T10:33:00.000Z	metalsand		You've been using Linux for probably more than a decade. Of course you're going to be used to that
2005-05-19T10:34:00.000Z	metalsand		However, sit a person whose never used a PC before in the life with a Windows setup, and then sit them down at a Linux setup
2005-05-19T10:34:00.000Z	metalsand		and I gaurentee it'd be MUCH easier given all the GUI tools, all the access to drivers and overall professional support Windows has.
2005-05-19T10:36:00.000Z	sig	metalsand	then your using crappy hardware
2005-05-19T10:37:00.000Z	sig	metalsand	you're being silly now.
2005-05-19T10:37:00.000Z	metalsand	sig	How sow?
2005-05-19T10:38:00.000Z	sig	metalsand	instead of arguing here why not google or look on forums to get the hardware working.
2005-05-19T10:38:00.000Z	metalsand	sig	You don't know my situation.
2005-05-19T10:38:00.000Z	sig	metalsand	well enlighten me then.
2005-05-19T10:39:00.000Z	metalsand	sig	I've spent probably 24 hours+ in this channel the last week taking full walk through over 3 different software sets, readying every support article I can about Linux/Ubuntu on the drivers, and I'm still where I started.
2005-05-19T10:39:00.000Z	sig	metalsand	what hardware?
2005-05-19T10:39:00.000Z	metalsand	sig	Senao NL 2511 Plus Ext 2 wireless PCMCIA NIC
2005-05-19T10:45:00.000Z	sig	metalsand	take the card out, and run this in a terminal: "tail -f /var/log/messages"
2005-05-19T10:54:00.000Z	sig	metalsand	dude, that card is obviously not worth it
2005-05-19T10:56:00.000Z	metalsand	sig	So help me out
2005-05-19T10:56:00.000Z	metalsand	sig	No one else can get it working
