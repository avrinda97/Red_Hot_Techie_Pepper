2009-02-04T00:29:00.000Z	user_	bitmonster	thanks, reading
2009-02-04T00:35:00.000Z	user_	bitmonster	are you running the latest stable kubuntu?
2009-02-04T00:35:00.000Z	bitmonster	user_	i hope so ... it's kubuntu 8.10 desktop
2009-02-04T00:35:00.000Z	user_	bitmonster	yes, just wanted to crosscheck
2009-02-04T00:36:00.000Z	bitmonster	user_	the problem seems to be resolved after this hard resetting link
2009-02-04T00:36:00.000Z	user_	bitmonster	?
2009-02-04T00:36:00.000Z	bitmonster	user_	that's in line 547
2009-02-04T00:37:00.000Z	bitmonster	user_	the thing is that i have already set a rootdelay=10
2009-02-04T00:38:00.000Z	user_	bitmonster	can you read and write to the disk?
2009-02-04T00:38:00.000Z	bitmonster	user_	sure
2009-02-04T00:38:00.000Z	bitmonster	user_	after this hard reset i can actually use my external hdd
2009-02-04T00:39:00.000Z	bitmonster	user_	the question is why it needs the hard reset and how it is triggered
2009-02-04T00:40:00.000Z	user_	bitmonster	thats a good question indeed, i dont know for sure, maybe th guys over in #linux know (dont tell them its kubuntu firsthand, they can react a bit allergic to *buntu)
2009-02-04T00:41:00.000Z	bitmonster	user_	i know ..the real people who never attended computer science courses ...
2009-02-04T00:42:00.000Z	bitmonster	user_	let's make them feel superior ;-)
