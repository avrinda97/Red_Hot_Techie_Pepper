2010-01-24T04:30:00.000Z	jibberia		evenin' - gparted question. booted off cd. made a bunch of (significant) changes, hit "apply" and the gparted window disappeared -- and the cd-rom drive is making repetitive thrashy sounds (as in, it sounds like it's having trouble reading)
2010-01-24T04:30:00.000Z	jibberia		think it b0rked my drive already?
2010-01-24T04:30:00.000Z	jibberia		i can't imagine why it would need to read from the CD-ROM once it's doing its thing...?
2010-01-24T04:31:00.000Z	h2g2bob	jibberia	see if it's still running with system monitor?
2010-01-24T04:31:00.000Z	jibberia	h2g2bob	i'm running the gparted live cd
2010-01-24T04:32:00.000Z	jibberia	h2g2bob	there are icons for terminal, info, and some other junk, but nothing seems to work.
2010-01-24T04:34:00.000Z	jibberia	h2g2bob	i know this is a tough question.... aaaany advice is appreciated
2010-01-24T04:36:00.000Z	h2g2bob	jibberia	it's a bit outside my comfort zone too - any way to get into some sort of shell?
2010-01-24T04:37:00.000Z	h2g2bob	jibberia	You could check the hard disk activity light as well - silly suggestion but worth looking
2010-01-24T04:38:00.000Z	jibberia	h2g2bob	good suggestion. been looking at it
2010-01-24T04:39:00.000Z	h2g2bob	jibberia	i guess probably not doing anything - if it's moving data (resizing partitions, etc) it would probably be lit up quite a lot
2010-01-24T04:42:00.000Z	h2g2bob	jibberia	if theres any way to get to a shell you should be able to see if it's still running
2010-01-24T04:44:00.000Z	h2g2bob	jibberia	does it have ctrl+alt+f_something?
2010-01-24T04:45:00.000Z	jibberia	h2g2bob	YES thank you
2010-01-24T04:45:00.000Z	h2g2bob	jibberia	 ps -ef | less  will list processes
2010-01-24T04:45:00.000Z	h2g2bob	jibberia	cool
2010-01-24T04:47:00.000Z	h2g2bob	jibberia	gparted starts up subprocesses with the command line resizing tools, etc. so don't just look for gparted :)
2010-01-24T05:26:00.000Z	jibberia	h2g2bob	fyi, i asked somebody to flip a coin, and it came up with "REBOOT" and grub loaded and booted normally. then i came. now i'm going to run away from this dell as fast as i can.
2010-01-24T05:27:00.000Z	h2g2bob	jibberia	phew!
2010-01-24T05:28:00.000Z	jibberia	h2g2bob	it was either spend an evening trying to restore that machine *somehow* or not cancel a date. now i get to go get my flirt on. gotta remember not to mention linux, at all, ever, ever. ;)
2010-01-24T05:29:00.000Z	h2g2bob	jibberia	good luck :) much more fun i hope
