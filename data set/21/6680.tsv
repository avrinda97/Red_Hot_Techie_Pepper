2007-10-16T09:07:00.000Z	rryan	xp_prg	: from the command line, type 'xev',  then hit the double quote key and tell us if anything comes up.  Hit CTRL+C to quit after trying
2007-10-16T09:08:00.000Z	xp_prg	rryan	well the log scrolls but nothing comes up on the screen
2007-10-16T09:09:00.000Z	rryan	xp_prg	:  so when you first start it up, a bunch of stuff will go by, but if yo udont move your mouse or tyep anything it should become stilll, then if you hit your double quote key nothing comes up ?
2007-10-16T09:09:00.000Z	xp_prg	rryan	you want to see the log output?
2007-10-16T09:10:00.000Z	rryan	xp_prg	 Sure. If nothing comes up, then it's probable that your X server has the wrong keyboard layout for your keyboard.
2007-10-16T09:10:00.000Z	xp_prg	rryan	can you pretty please tell me how to fix that?
2007-10-16T09:12:00.000Z	rryan	xp_prg	: Could I see the output from xev ?
2007-10-16T09:19:00.000Z	rryan	xp_prg	: I didn't see when you sent it, where did you put it ?
2007-10-16T09:24:00.000Z	rryan	xp_prg	did you put hte output of xev in a pastebin somewhere?  sorry I must have missed it
2007-10-16T09:24:00.000Z	xp_prg	rryan	you here?
2007-10-16T09:30:00.000Z	rryan	xp_prg	it looks like your " key is mapped incorrectly to dead_diaresus
2007-10-16T09:31:00.000Z	xp_prg	rryan	please tell me how to fix this I beg of you :>
2007-10-16T09:31:00.000Z	rryan	xp_prg	 try the following command :  xmodmap -e "keynum 48 = apostrophe quotedbl"
2007-10-16T09:34:00.000Z	rryan	xp_prg	you should try going to system > preferences > keyboard and making sure that you have teh right keyboard selected and keyboard layout
2007-10-16T09:35:00.000Z	xp_prg	rryan	I did try that, it all looks right to me
2007-10-16T09:36:00.000Z	rryan	xp_prg	I gotta get going, but at least that'll get you heading in the right direction :)
