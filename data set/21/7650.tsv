2006-10-03T05:57:00.000Z	ucordes_		what command do i have to issue in order to open another xsrv
2006-10-03T05:57:00.000Z	ucordes_		?
2006-10-03T05:57:00.000Z	Warbo	ucordes_	"X :1"
2006-10-03T05:58:00.000Z	Warbo	ucordes_	Just give it IP Address:server number. Since I guess you want it on your local machine leave IP Address blank, then since you have a server running on :0 use :1 instead
2006-10-03T05:59:00.000Z	Warbo	ucordes_	To give regular users permission to run programs on that server you may want to use "X -ac :1"
2006-10-03T05:59:00.000Z	ucordes_	Warbo	thanks a lot. but this only gets me a grey screen with a cursor. how can i run applications on this?
2006-10-03T05:59:00.000Z	Warbo	ucordes_	OK, go back to another terminal
2006-10-03T06:00:00.000Z	Warbo	ucordes_	run "export DISPLAY=localhost:1" then run whatever program you want, like gnome-session or startkde
2006-10-03T06:00:00.000Z	Warbo	ucordes_	You can actually use System>Quit>Switch User to start up another login screen, which may be what you are after
2006-10-03T06:01:00.000Z	ucordes_	Warbo	but doesn't this operation close my current x?
2006-10-03T06:01:00.000Z	ucordes_	Warbo	btw: my first xserver froze after openning the second one with X :1
2006-10-03T06:01:00.000Z	Warbo	ucordes_	No. Actually If you right click on the Ubuntu logo in the top left and go "Edit Menus" you can enable a new login menu option in "System Tools" menu
2006-10-03T06:02:00.000Z	Warbo	ucordes_	Oh? Usually ctrl-alt-f7 and ctrl-alt-f9 can switch between and you can use both fine
2006-10-03T06:03:00.000Z	ucordes_	Warbo	ye and ctrl-alt-f7 is dead now
2006-10-03T06:03:00.000Z	ucordes_	Warbo	ye and ctrl-alt-f8 -> grey screen with X cursor
2006-10-03T06:04:00.000Z	Warbo	ucordes_	Hmm, just tried it myself and switch user isn't working (probably my effed up X, so I am using AiGLX just because X doesn't work)
2006-10-03T06:04:00.000Z	ucordes_	Warbo	i see
2006-10-03T06:05:00.000Z	ucordes_	Warbo	so you think with aiglx ill prolly do better?
2006-10-03T06:05:00.000Z	Warbo	ucordes_	NO!
2006-10-03T06:06:00.000Z	Warbo	ucordes_	AiGLX messes up switch user, since it hasn't been tested much
2006-10-03T06:07:00.000Z	ucordes_	Warbo	oh ok. i got this twisted. have to leave . thx for your help and have a good time
