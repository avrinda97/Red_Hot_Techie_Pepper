2006-06-03T14:32:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		But I've really had my share of problems already
2006-06-03T14:32:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		All I want is clean install god damn it
2006-06-03T14:32:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		I wiped the entire disk and decided to reinstall fresh
2006-06-03T14:32:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		and I get corrupted packages
2006-06-03T14:33:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		Avis, burnt it with 4x CD-R on Track-at-once
2006-06-03T14:33:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		k
2006-06-03T14:33:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		The ONE thing I want though
2006-06-03T14:33:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		Just one
2006-06-03T14:33:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		Is for Firefox to work in Ubuntu.
2006-06-03T14:33:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		That's it
2006-06-03T14:33:00.000Z	cristos	DarkLegacy	whats the problem ? I've installed Dapper yesterday without ANY problems
2006-06-03T14:34:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		My laptop hates me, that's what's the problem
2006-06-03T14:34:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		I barely got Badger installed, but Dapper is just dead
2006-06-03T14:34:00.000Z	cristos	DarkLegacy	and... ISO are burnt DAO :)
2006-06-03T14:34:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		I've got two blank CD-r's left
2006-06-03T14:34:00.000Z	DarkLegacy	cristos	DAO makes my laptop unable to read it
2006-06-03T14:35:00.000Z	cristos		is there any way to install Opera in Dapper ?
2006-06-03T14:35:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		Cristos, I think so
2006-06-03T14:35:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		The hard linux way
2006-06-03T14:36:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		Download package, ungzip, compile, config, install
2006-06-03T14:36:00.000Z	cristos	DarkLegacy	tried with opera deb package, but is mumbles about missing libs, which actually ARE installed
