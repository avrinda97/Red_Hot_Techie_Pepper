2007-08-08T12:49:00.000Z	avarner		there ya go thanks
2007-08-08T12:50:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	avarner	this is also very good http://www.getdeb.net/app.php?name=ISO+Master
2007-10-18T05:43:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	avarner	you can login in any of the ctrl+alt+f1-6 or ctrl+alt+f7 to get back to your graphical desktop
2007-10-18T05:44:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	avarner	ctrl+alt+backspace restarts X your graphical interface
2007-10-18T05:44:00.000Z	avarner	Paddy_EIRE	getting back in isn't the issue, getting out is. the screen that cntrl+alt+f1/2 doesn't let me out
2007-10-18T05:44:00.000Z	avarner	Paddy_EIRE	or doesn't do anything but blink at me
2007-10-18T05:44:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	avarner	I told you already.. ctrl+alt+f7 takes you back to your gui
2007-10-18T05:44:00.000Z	avarner	Paddy_EIRE	and i told you already control+alt+f7 isn't what i want
2007-10-18T05:44:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	avarner	what are you trying to do there
2007-10-18T05:45:00.000Z	avarner	Paddy_EIRE	i'm trying to install a new driver and it won't let me if i'm logged into x
2007-10-18T05:45:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	avarner	then end your x session
2007-10-18T05:46:00.000Z	avarner	Paddy_EIRE	well yeah, how do i do that besides cntrl+alt+f1?
2007-10-18T05:47:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	avarner	ctrl+alt+f1 then login and install driver then switch back to x session using ctrl+alt+f7 then restart x using ctrl+alt+backspace
2007-10-18T05:48:00.000Z	avarner	Paddy_EIRE	well that's what i've been saying all of this time. i cntrl+alt+f1 does NOT let me do anything, it just blinks. no input at all.
2007-10-18T05:49:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	avarner	type your login name.. then type password (password will not show up) press enter
2007-10-18T05:49:00.000Z	avarner	Paddy_EIRE	just tried again still doesn't work NO INPUT
2007-10-18T05:50:00.000Z	avarner	Paddy_EIRE	it is impossible to put text in that screen that i get it is not the normal screen at all
2007-10-18T05:50:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	avarner	what do you mean.. no input?
2007-10-18T05:52:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	avarner	does the screen look anything like this http://www.paddyeire.talktalk.net/Screenshot-Terminal.png
