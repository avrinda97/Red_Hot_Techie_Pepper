2012-09-17T10:37:00.000Z	random_		i really would like to get this fixed :/ ...
2012-09-17T10:37:00.000Z	random_		i have two monitors, and only can use one
2012-09-17T10:39:00.000Z	random_		Just use a live ubuntu disk and use gparted to delete all the partitions
2012-09-17T10:39:00.000Z	ejo	random_	what have you tried so far, I came in late
2012-09-17T10:41:00.000Z	random_	ejo	Well i use to be able to go into Settings > Display, and turn my other monitor on, but the monitor would not go on, but now i get a RANDR is not present error, and it crashes, i use to be able to go into nvidia-settings and enable my other monitor there, but still, it didnt turn the monitor on, and now i can even hit the apply button for it, im not sure what to do
2012-09-17T10:43:00.000Z	ejo	random_	I'm on ATI rather than Nvidia so I won't be able to go the full distance with you, but there are a few possibilities.  One is if you're trying to use Xinerama and shouldn't be (or vice versa)... another is you might need to just remove your drivers and reinstall them
2012-09-17T10:43:00.000Z	random_	ejo	i saved the xorg.conf and rebooted, re-installed my driver, plugged in and out my monitor, nothing will turn my second monitor on. Nvida on gnome classic.
2012-09-17T10:44:00.000Z	random_	ejo	no, SLI 8800gt's
2012-09-17T10:44:00.000Z	random_	ejo	well was sli, until i re did my driver, so they wont be on sli mode right now
2012-09-17T10:45:00.000Z	ejo	random_	hate to say it, but your configuration is probably enough different from mine that I won't be able to help.
2012-09-17T10:45:00.000Z	ejo	random_	however I think it's very likely you will be able to solve it
2012-09-17T10:46:00.000Z	random_	ejo	erm they are in sli mode. and yea understandable. im just fusterated, cause literally, this is my first OS that i've had any problems with duel monitors.
2012-09-17T10:47:00.000Z	ejo	random_	it is true that Linux is, sadly, still the land of slightly less ease in multi-monitor setups.  However you WILL get it working for dual.  You should see what I went through to attempt triple on two cards.  Not possible for now.
2012-09-17T10:47:00.000Z	ejo	random_	have you tried the nvidia on linux support channel?  (i don't know the exact name).  The similar one for ATI helped me more than this ubuntu channel by far.
2012-09-17T10:48:00.000Z	random_	ejo	 i would, if i knew the channel
2012-09-17T10:49:00.000Z	ejo	random_	surely you'll find it via google if you're persistent.  Also, Sunday in the middle of North American night is not exactly the high point of IRC traffic.
2012-09-17T10:50:00.000Z	random_	ejo	yea indeed, well right now im trying to fix my Randr is not present error :/
2012-09-17T10:52:00.000Z	ejo	random_	if I remember correctly, xrandr is just not up to date for linux currently, and for some time... it will be great when/if they get the two back together but in the meantime I think a "randr not present" error means you just went the wrong way
2012-09-17T10:54:00.000Z	random_	ejo	it was working before i stared messing with this stuff lol
2012-09-17T10:54:00.000Z	ejo	random_	that probably indicates that solutions similar to reinstalling stuff and cleaning out configs will be best.
2012-09-17T10:55:00.000Z	random_	ejo	yea thanks for the help
