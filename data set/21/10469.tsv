2006-06-08T06:52:00.000Z	jimcooncat		Logged in with ssh to home machine, how can I issue a popup to the destop user?
2006-06-08T06:54:00.000Z	jimcooncat		maybe export DISPLAY=0:0 && xenity "IM me!"?
2006-06-08T06:55:00.000Z	cef	jimcooncat	ssh into your own machine and try it *grin*
2006-06-08T06:56:00.000Z	jimcooncat	cef	I am, just have to use "zenity" not "xenity" :-)
2006-06-08T06:56:00.000Z	cef	jimcooncat	woot!
2006-06-08T07:04:00.000Z	cef	jimcooncat	figured it out?
2006-06-08T07:05:00.000Z	cef	jimcooncat	'DISPLAY=:0.0 zenity --info --text="This is a test."' works for me
2006-06-08T07:05:00.000Z	jimcooncat	cef	--no not yet
2006-06-08T07:06:00.000Z	cef	jimcooncat	that version has the added advantage of not modifying the display var for the session, so other X based commands SSH forward properly
2006-06-08T07:07:00.000Z	jimcooncat	cef	I get "This option is not available"
2006-06-08T07:07:00.000Z	jimcooncat		Just on the remote machine, it's ok with ssh'ing to my own
2006-06-08T07:07:00.000Z	cef	jimcooncat	are you usong :0.0 for the display? you weren't before
2006-06-08T07:07:00.000Z	cef		using even
2006-06-08T07:08:00.000Z	jimcooncat	cef	ok, I understand now, Xlib refused the connection
2006-06-08T07:08:00.000Z	cef	jimcooncat	yeah.. I got that wrong before too, which threw me off for a bit. *grin*
2006-06-08T07:09:00.000Z	jimcooncat		I guess xhost needs to be set
2006-06-08T07:09:00.000Z	cef	jimcooncat	are you the same user as the logged in X user?
2006-06-08T07:10:00.000Z	jimcooncat	cef	I think I got it by sudo su "user" first
2006-06-08T07:11:00.000Z	cef	jimcooncat	yeah.. it'll be xhost or Xauthority holding you back otherwise
2006-06-08T07:12:00.000Z	jimcooncat	cef	good, thanks a bunch!
2006-06-08T07:12:00.000Z	cef	jimcooncat	no problem
