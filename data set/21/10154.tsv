2005-05-07T16:09:00.000Z	k4rl		chavo: what's also useful to know in the font world is that if you have MS office docs, tha tused arial, they'll look like crap if you do a Openoffice->export pdf, until you install the MS fonts, or change the fonts in the doc
2005-05-07T16:10:00.000Z	holy_cow	k4rl	oh thats a good test, never thought of that
2005-05-07T16:10:00.000Z	k4rl	holy_cow	there's an ms fonts package, it worked really really well :)
2005-05-07T16:11:00.000Z	holy_cow	k4rl	msfonts are ugly imho
2005-05-07T16:11:00.000Z	k4rl		chavo: there might be, and it all looks good on screen in Open Office,
2005-05-07T16:11:00.000Z	holy_cow		i never ever install them, but i never considered the conversion issue
2005-05-07T16:11:00.000Z	k4rl		but when you export the pdf, the spaces all go to hell and stuff.
2005-05-07T16:11:00.000Z	holy_cow		adobe fontfolio on the other hand, very usefull
2005-05-07T16:11:00.000Z	holy_cow	k4rl	*nod* i gotta see for my self :)
2005-05-07T16:12:00.000Z	k4rl		(it may have been the particular styling of arial in my doc, but it was horrible, I actually ended up redoing it in OO anyway)
2005-05-07T16:12:00.000Z	k4rl		things created by the resume wizard in office aren't particularly portable it seems.
2005-05-07T16:13:00.000Z	k4rl		they try and do stupid unnecessary tricks with text alignment.
2005-05-07T16:14:00.000Z	k4rl		google it in quot emarks?
2005-05-07T16:14:00.000Z	holy_cow	k4rl	people think of ms office as quality software and in some ways it is, then you export to html ...
2005-05-07T16:15:00.000Z	k4rl		cow: though it's html export is much better than it used to be.
2005-05-07T16:15:00.000Z	holy_cow	k4rl	they not only did a poor job, they went out of their way to make it terrible, i find that psychology fascinating
2005-05-07T16:15:00.000Z	k4rl		well, all I know is that until word2k, it was a pig, and since then it's been reasonably useful.
2005-05-07T16:16:00.000Z	k4rl		though perhaps it was just that I wrote my thesis in it, and had to learn it.
2005-05-07T16:16:00.000Z	k4rl		OO was ok too, I think I'll be fine with it in another usage or so.
2005-05-07T16:17:00.000Z	k4rl		the first one was a bit of a pain, as it looked similar, but wasn't
2005-05-07T16:17:00.000Z	holy_cow	k4rl	we are waiting for 2.0 to be released, then switching the entire company
