2011-12-23T03:34:00.000Z	tommylommykins		For example, how am I supposed to know that the correct process is to leave the "headers" package?
2011-12-23T03:34:00.000Z	tommylommykins		You cannot derive that from seeing the grub entry.
2011-12-23T03:35:00.000Z	tommylommykins		but how do I know that the "headers" package is not the kernel?
2011-12-23T03:35:00.000Z	tommylommykins		And how do I know that the "image" package is the correct package to remove
2011-12-23T03:35:00.000Z	sskalnik	tommylommykins	 headers != kernel, two different things
2011-12-23T03:36:00.000Z	sskalnik	tommylommykins	 You just need to remove the linus-image-blahblahblah package via Synaptic for the kernels you want to remove.
2011-12-23T03:36:00.000Z	sskalnik	tommylommykins	 It is as un-dangerous as it can be. Much better than trying to do it manually.
2011-12-23T03:37:00.000Z	sskalnik	tommylommykins	 Just don't remove the latest one or  whichever one you want to use.
2011-12-23T03:38:00.000Z	sskalnik	tommylommykins	 It can't eally get any more simple or foolproof. If you are messing with kernels, it is assumed you have a reason to do so, and thus have an idea of what you are doing.
2011-12-23T03:38:00.000Z	sskalnik	tommylommykins	 it is quite reversible.
2011-12-23T03:38:00.000Z	tommylommykins	sskalnik	I have reason to because I want to make my boot menu clear. Otherwise I do not want to know anything about the Kernel
2011-12-23T03:39:00.000Z	sskalnik	tommylommykins	 OK then. Just remove all the kernels aside from the one you are using.
2011-12-23T03:39:00.000Z	sskalnik	tommylommykins	 sounds like you're good then. ;)
2011-12-23T03:40:00.000Z	sskalnik	tommylommykins	 What you have been told *is* an official method.
2011-12-23T03:41:00.000Z	tommylommykins	sskalnik	 But surely I should not have to come on IRC to discover this?
2011-12-23T03:41:00.000Z	sskalnik	tommylommykins	 This info is just a google away. It is also on the official forums. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1587462
2011-12-23T03:42:00.000Z	sskalnik	tommylommykins	 You have been told several times what the official method is, and that it will work. Not sure what you could ask for on top of that.
2011-12-23T03:43:00.000Z	sskalnik	tommylommykins	 Read the link I posted; it shows multiple methods from the official forums.
2011-12-23T03:44:00.000Z	sskalnik	tommylommykins	 This is not the complaint dept. You have been given what you asked for. What do you want us to *do* nect?
2011-12-23T03:45:00.000Z	tommylommykins	sskalnik	Nothing. I guess it is time for me to shut up
2011-12-23T03:45:00.000Z	sskalnik	tommylommykins	 Sounds like a good plan. Any of those methods will work for you, so you should be good. If not, please let us know.
