2010-08-12T07:42:00.000Z	KE1HA	FloridaGuy	Ubuntu is saying, they want to controll the outflow to keep one person from overloading the DL server if the make a mistake or something and DL 20 at a time or something. Simplified answer but ya get the drift.
2010-08-12T07:43:00.000Z	KE1HA	FloridaGuy	then they have throttled it as well, allot of image sites do that, especially if here bandwidth limited.
