2006-04-24T10:14:00.000Z	cycom	OrTigaS	was there anything about a /dev/tty ?
2006-04-24T10:04:00.000Z	cycom	OrTigaS	have you plugged it in yet?
2006-04-24T10:04:00.000Z	cycom	OrTigaS	^
2006-04-24T10:04:00.000Z	OrTigaS	cycom	yes
2006-04-24T10:05:00.000Z	cycom	OrTigaS	don't worry about the driver CD yet. it may have been detected. Type 'dmesg' and see if it's there.
2006-04-24T10:05:00.000Z	cycom	OrTigaS	or 'lsusb'
2006-04-24T10:06:00.000Z	cycom	OrTigaS	not sure.  it'll be near the end.  Try unplugging it and plugging it back in and looking for a change.
2006-04-24T10:06:00.000Z	cycom	OrTigaS	what does it say?
2006-04-24T10:07:00.000Z	cycom	OrTigaS	good! now what are you hooking up to the serial port?
2006-04-24T10:07:00.000Z	OrTigaS	cycom	i'm gonna try the minicom to connect
2006-04-24T10:09:00.000Z	cycom	OrTigaS	in dmesg did you see anything about a /dev/ttySomething?
2006-04-24T10:10:00.000Z	OrTigaS	cycom	i didn't see yet
2006-04-24T10:10:00.000Z	cycom	OrTigaS	he pinged the channel.
2006-04-24T10:11:00.000Z	cycom	OrTigaS	but back to the serial port: try typing dmesg and looking for a new tty at the very end.
2006-04-24T10:12:00.000Z	OrTigaS	cycom	ok gonna try that
2006-04-24T10:13:00.000Z	OrTigaS	cycom	i saw a usb-serial
2006-04-24T10:14:00.000Z	cycom	OrTigaS	I think that's it. That would be your serial port, unless I'm sadly mistaken.
2006-04-24T10:15:00.000Z	cycom	OrTigaS	I'm not too familiar with minicom.  Let me see what I can dig up real quick
2006-04-24T10:15:00.000Z	OrTigaS	cycom	thanks! i'm gonna try then if theres a prob a gonna ask again! Thank You Very Much!
