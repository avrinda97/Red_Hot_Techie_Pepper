2007-09-06T16:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nighthawk420	What is the problem you were having with Feisty?
2007-09-06T16:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nighthawk420	What GFX card?
2007-09-06T16:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nighthawk420	And how are you trying to connect to the net?
2007-09-06T16:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nighthawk420	That should work with fglrx from the repos
2007-09-06T16:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nighthawk420	So now all you need is to get on the net :)
2007-09-06T16:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nighthawk420	I'll walk you through :)
2007-09-06T16:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nighthawk420	How are you connected to the net? ( wired or wireless ) ?
2007-09-06T16:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nighthawk420	Can you connect wired temporarily ( makes things much easier )
2007-09-06T16:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nighthawk420	Ok, then do that then run "sudo ifconfig eth0" then "sudo dhclient eth0" ( connecting and configuring with DHCP ) then "sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx" ( installs the driver ) then "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh" and choose "fglrx" as the driver when asked
2007-09-06T16:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nighthawk420	then run "sudo ifconfig eth0" then "sudo dhclient eth0" ( connecting and configuring with DHCP ) then "sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx" ( installs the driver ) then "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh" and choose "fglrx" as the driver when asked
2007-09-06T16:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nighthawk420	I am going to sleep, but once you have done that the driver will be installed, at that point either reboot or run "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart" to get into X
2007-09-18T16:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nighthawk420	What GPU?

2007-09-18T16:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nighthawk420	Are you using the open source drivers or fglrx?
2007-09-18T16:28:00.000Z	Nighthawk420	Jordan_U	i am using fglrx
2007-09-18T16:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Nighthawk420	can you pastebin the output of "sudo modprobe fglrx" if any ?
2007-09-18T16:29:00.000Z	Nighthawk420	Jordan_U	there was no terminal output
