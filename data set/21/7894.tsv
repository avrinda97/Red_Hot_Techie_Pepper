2006-06-21T13:02:00.000Z	kazil		i`ve got it from help.ubuntu.com polpak
2006-06-21T13:02:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	ok
2006-06-23T14:21:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	for movies it will cover a lot. You'll probably also need totem-xine, and if you want dvd playback you'll have to follow those instructions also
2006-06-23T14:25:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	yes you need the deb
2006-06-23T14:25:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	download it and install with dpkg -i thefile.deb
2006-06-23T14:25:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	you'll need sudo obviously
2006-06-23T14:26:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	and also sudo apt-get install totem-xine
2006-06-23T14:32:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	it's fine. just doesn't work well with restricted formats
2006-06-23T14:32:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	get totem-xine
2006-06-23T14:41:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	you should just need the w32 codecs and totem-xine
2006-06-23T14:42:00.000Z	kazil	polpak	please go here http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy/gnome/totem-xine what are those red dotted files?
2006-06-23T14:43:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	they are dependancies.. Most of them you probably already have
2006-06-23T14:43:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	if you just type sudo apt-get install totem-xine it will auto install all the dependancies you need
2006-06-23T14:44:00.000Z	kazil	polpak	to search my ubuntu for them files first, to see if i have them?
2006-06-23T14:44:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	just do what I said
2006-06-23T14:44:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	that's why we have repositories
2006-06-23T14:44:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	if you just type      sudo apt-get install totem-xine        it will check what you have, and get what you need
2006-06-23T14:45:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	eh.. why not?
2006-06-23T14:45:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	that's not an explaination
2006-06-23T14:46:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	you clearly have an internet connection.. cause you are talking to me on it
2006-06-23T14:47:00.000Z	polpak	kazil	it's in a different location?
