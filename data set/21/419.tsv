2012-08-08T00:58:00.000Z	Agamemnus		oh my god, finally....... so i just copied the new libffd file with the old name, and changed the permissions of usr/lib so I can do that.... now this stinking thing works :)
2012-08-08T00:58:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	OUCH.
2012-08-07T23:44:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	whats the output of lsb_release -sc ?
2012-08-07T23:45:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	Whats this libbfd thing? From where did you install it?
2012-08-07T23:46:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	Well, then I cant help you much, sorry.
2012-08-08T00:43:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	ln -s oldfile newname
2012-08-08T00:44:00.000Z	Agamemnus	bekks	? I think I tried it.
2012-08-08T00:45:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	You did: ln -s newname oldfile
2012-08-08T00:48:00.000Z	Agamemnus	bekks	so, basically, (1) my error when compiling is "fbc: error loading shared libraries: libbfd-2.21.53-system.20110810.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory", and I think the new file is called libbfd-2.22-system.so.. any idea on how to fix this?
2012-08-08T00:59:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	You dont have to touch the permissions of /usr/lib at all.
2012-08-08T00:59:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	Just use sudo cp next time.
2012-08-08T00:59:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	Did you change the permissions back to what they've been before?
2012-08-08T01:00:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	what are they now, on your box?
2012-08-08T01:00:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	Which command did you run, exactly?
2012-08-08T01:01:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	Well, and using which command?
2012-08-08T01:01:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	So you used sudo chmod but you did not use sudo cp? Odd.
2012-08-08T01:02:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	NO. DONT touch the permissions.
2012-08-08T01:02:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	Use sudo.
2012-08-08T01:02:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	644
2012-08-08T01:33:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	By not linking statically.
2012-08-08T01:34:00.000Z	bekks	Agamemnus	Then you have to live with that warning.
