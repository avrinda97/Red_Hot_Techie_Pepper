2012-06-07T22:28:00.000Z	truepurple		Vhuck_Norris, I don't want to upgrade now, so how can I fix this problem without doing so?
2012-06-07T22:29:00.000Z	delac	truepurple	have you tried this?: http://askubuntu.com/questions/58928/update-manager-says-not-all-updates-can-be-installed
2012-06-07T22:37:00.000Z	truepurple	delac	I tried following those instructions, I ended up where I unintentionally removed VLC. But I want VLC, its the only video player I have that runs commercial DVDs decently
2012-06-07T22:39:00.000Z	delac	truepurple	did you manage to install everything else?
2012-06-07T22:40:00.000Z	truepurple	delac	I guess so
2012-06-07T22:41:00.000Z	delac	truepurple	well, then just reinstall the vlc.
2012-06-07T22:43:00.000Z	truepurple	delac	Should I do it through software center, or what?
2012-06-07T22:44:00.000Z	delac	truepurple	software center, synaptic, apt-get install vlc... all of them should work
2012-06-07T22:51:00.000Z	delac	truepurple	should not. I'm not sure, but afaik both synaptic and software center are just guis for apt-get
2012-06-07T22:52:00.000Z	truepurple	delac	guis is graphical front end, like GUI but a different software design or something?
2012-06-07T22:54:00.000Z	delac	truepurple	if something is gui for something else, the gui uses the same code as the underlying thing to do the task. gui just adds the visual part
2012-06-07T22:55:00.000Z	delac	truepurple	in this case, there might be further differences, but it is very unlikely that any problems would occur using any of these programs
2012-06-07T22:56:00.000Z	delac	truepurple	guis is just plural of gui
2012-06-07T23:06:00.000Z	truepurple	delac	when I try to install VLC, I get the following errors http://i46.tinypic.com/15c45u.png
2012-06-07T23:15:00.000Z	delac	truepurple	it's probably the vlc daily build ppa. the vlc there seems to require newer libraries than natty can provide
2012-06-07T23:17:00.000Z	delac	truepurple	did you try to install  vlc from main repository?
2012-06-07T23:17:00.000Z	truepurple	delac	How do i do that?
2012-06-07T23:20:00.000Z	delac	truepurple	I dont use software center, but at the moment you seem to have selected VLC Daily Build ppa. Try selectin Get Software -> Sound and Video
2012-06-07T23:24:00.000Z	truepurple	delac	where is this "get software"?
2012-06-07T23:25:00.000Z	delac	truepurple	just below the File Edit View Help
2012-06-07T23:26:00.000Z	truepurple	delac	in the software center?
