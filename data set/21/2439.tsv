2009-10-13T08:48:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer		Is there a way to turn of where pidgin tells you every time someone leaves or enters, maybe for a channel? There's more leave/enter notices then actual chat
2009-10-13T08:49:00.000Z	mnaines	SoftwareExplorer	Yes, its a plugin
2009-10-13T08:50:00.000Z	mnaines	SoftwareExplorer	Its the Join/Part Hiding Plugin, v2.6.1
2009-10-13T08:50:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	mnaines	Where can I get it/ what is it called?
2009-10-13T08:50:00.000Z	mnaines	SoftwareExplorer	Go into synaptic and download all the available plugin packs for Pidgin and you'll get it
2009-10-13T08:51:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	mnaines	Thanks, I'll be back in awhile
2009-10-13T08:51:00.000Z	mnaines	SoftwareExplorer	After you do that, go to Pidgin>Tools>Plugins then check the box next to "Join/Part Hiding"
2009-10-13T08:55:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	mnaines	Thanks, it must be working, or people suddenly stopped connecting to the ubuntu channel
2009-10-13T08:57:00.000Z	mnaines	SoftwareExplorer	What that does is hides any join/part messages that are not active users.  For example, if they do not type anything in chat, it will hide the notification that they joined or left
2009-10-13T08:58:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	mnaines	thats smart
2009-10-13T09:42:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	mnaines	what was it?
2009-10-13T09:43:00.000Z	mnaines	SoftwareExplorer	I dreamed that Microsoft took Ubuntu, made this http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Nimbus-Aero+Improved+?content=113537 the default theme and called it Windows
2009-10-13T09:45:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	mnaines	Good thing that the FSF exists, even if i'm not as radical as them, I know they would make a ton of noise if that happend
2009-10-13T09:45:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	mnaines	Free Software Foundation, the GNU guys, the GPL licence writers
2009-10-13T09:46:00.000Z	mnaines	SoftwareExplorer	Its only a matter of time before MS does something like that, though
2009-10-13T09:47:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	mnaines	they might be to proud to admit they failed to make a good OS
2009-10-13T09:47:00.000Z	mnaines	SoftwareExplorer	And if they do this, they can easily avoid having to admit that
2009-10-13T09:48:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	mnaines	I guess they could sell it, but anyone could make copies that were identical legally, so the free marked would make the disks like a dollar
2009-10-13T09:48:00.000Z	mnaines	SoftwareExplorer	PM me...I can make you laugh
2009-10-13T09:49:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	mnaines	uhh, I'm new to IRC , how do I do that?
2009-10-13T09:49:00.000Z	mnaines	SoftwareExplorer	Right click on my name then click IM
