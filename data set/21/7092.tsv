2007-10-28T05:16:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	zylche	you should just be able to put the ip your looking for into grep and it'll go looking
2007-10-28T05:17:00.000Z	zylche	Atomic_UE	I don't know the ip. That's the problem
2007-10-28T05:17:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	zylche	then you need to search for something you do know
2007-10-28T05:17:00.000Z	zylche	Atomic_UE	That's why I need to check for ###[.|-]###[.|-]###[.|-]###
2007-10-28T05:18:00.000Z	zylche		Tried it
2007-10-28T05:19:00.000Z	zylche		or grep ip file.txt
2007-10-28T05:19:00.000Z	zylche		...
2007-10-28T05:19:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	zylche	if you don't know the ip your looking for then how do you know if it's the right one when you find it?
2007-10-28T05:19:00.000Z	zylche		I know the guys username. It'll be tagged that.
2007-10-28T05:32:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	zylche	sorry i ran away
2007-10-28T05:32:00.000Z	zylche		No problem
2007-10-28T05:34:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	zylche	do the usernames come before or after the IPs?
2007-10-28T05:34:00.000Z	zylche		before, irc log formatting, <user>
2007-10-28T05:35:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	zylche	grep -e '.*USER.*[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]*' log.txt
2007-10-28T05:35:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	zylche	try that
2007-10-28T05:35:00.000Z	zylche		hm..
2007-10-28T05:36:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	zylche	replacing USER ofcourse
2007-10-28T05:37:00.000Z	zylche		Works, but I don't seem to have it, thanks anyway Atomic_UE
2007-10-28T05:38:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	zylche	so it works, the log just doesn't have the info your looking for?
2007-10-28T05:38:00.000Z	zylche	Atomic_UE	yeah
2007-10-28T05:38:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	zylche	alright, no worries :)
