2012-10-30T23:23:00.000Z	coz_	glauco291	 I am going to assume  if you go to system settings  ,, mouse,, the acceleration sliders might help
2012-10-30T23:26:00.000Z	glauco291	coz_	there is no option to mouse wheel acceleration in system settings
2012-10-30T23:27:00.000Z	coz_	glauco291	 darn let me check on the system here, hold on
2012-10-30T23:28:00.000Z	coz_	glauco291	  is this a microsoft mouse?

2012-10-30T23:29:00.000Z	coz_	glauco291	 one of the frequent solutions I found online, was to unplug the mouse for a few seconds,, maybe 10 seconds, then plug it back in.. if that doenst work i will keep checking

2012-10-30T23:33:00.000Z	coz_	glauco291	 they talk about    sudo synclient VertScrollDelta=100  ... the higher the number the slower the scroll speed
2012-10-30T23:34:00.000Z	coz_	glauco291	 no problem
2012-10-30T23:35:00.000Z	coz_	glauco291	  it might be a slight bug on 12.10  but I have see that here

2012-10-30T23:38:00.000Z	coz_	glauco291	 from the beginning, if it is not an LTS release, it is probably best to think of the versions inbetween LTS as experimental
2012-10-30T23:40:00.000Z	coz_	glauco291	 understood
2012-10-30T23:40:00.000Z	coz_	glauco291	  still  search google using the 12.04 for the search
