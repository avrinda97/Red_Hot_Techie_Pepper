2009-10-23T04:27:00.000Z	Gratz474		would i notice any difference using 16 bit color over 24 bit ?
2009-10-23T04:28:00.000Z	durt	Gratz474	with most modern cards, my opinion is no, the scrolling issue with firefox could be a memory issue.
2009-10-23T04:36:00.000Z	Gratz474	durt	with an intel card using the uxa or what not they use now was useless, using exa with optimizations or using  xaa made scrolling flawless
2009-10-23T04:38:00.000Z	durt	Gratz474	so you needed hardware acceleration turned on then.
2009-10-23T04:39:00.000Z	Gratz474	durt	in what?
2009-10-23T04:39:00.000Z	Gratz474	durt	it was an intel card
2009-10-23T04:39:00.000Z	Gratz474	durt	integrated thing, exa pwned it xaa it worked find
2009-10-23T04:41:00.000Z	durt	Gratz474	understood, xaa is the newest acceleration IIRC.
2009-10-23T04:41:00.000Z	Gratz474	durt	i thought it was the oldest?
2009-10-23T04:42:00.000Z	durt	Gratz474	er, actually no, EXA replaced XAA, but UXA is the latest according to wikipedia
2009-10-23T04:42:00.000Z	Gratz474	durt	so what is my nvidia card running right now ?
2009-10-23T04:43:00.000Z	durt	Gratz474	I don't think nvidia uses Xrendering, it has it's own method.
2009-10-23T04:43:00.000Z	Gratz474	durt	thats not what i wanted to hear heheh
2009-10-23T04:44:00.000Z	Gratz474	durt	it works perfect all but the scrolling
2009-10-23T04:44:00.000Z	durt	Gratz474	I thinkl this is why the whole restricted drivers thing exists.
2009-10-23T04:46:00.000Z	durt	Gratz474	you can't.
2009-10-23T04:49:00.000Z	durt	Gratz474	that's fairly low, you should be getting ~5000, do you have the restricted drivers installed/running?
2009-10-23T04:50:00.000Z	Gratz474	durt	i am on a geforce 2 :) i was getting 80-100 with the intel
2009-10-23T04:50:00.000Z	durt	Gratz474	intel is not the right driver, nvidia 96.x is.
2009-10-23T04:51:00.000Z	Gratz474	durt	i meant the intel integrated card i used before
2009-10-23T05:01:00.000Z	durt	Gratz474	again, as far as FF is concerned, highly doubtful.
