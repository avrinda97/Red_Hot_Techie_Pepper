2005-02-03T09:20:00.000Z	piratePenguin		is there an easy way to update the /etc/rcX.d links so I can add my firewall script (in /etc/init.d/firewall)
2005-02-03T09:21:00.000Z	piratePenguin		thanks
2005-02-03T07:45:00.000Z	piratePenguin		I want my isdn devices to be created automatically so they're there when I needa connect to the internet... where should I put the mknod commands (what init/config file?)? (or is there another (better) way to set it up?)

2005-02-03T07:47:00.000Z	ogra	piratePenguin	:)
2005-02-03T09:46:00.000Z	ogra	piratePenguin	i wrote it, whats wrong with it ?
2005-02-03T09:46:00.000Z	piratePenguin	ogra	I *cannot* get it to work... Don't I need to install capi* binaries? (like capiinit etc..)?
2005-02-03T09:47:00.000Z	ogra	piratePenguin	it works as described on my test systems here.. (and on mvo's as well)
2005-02-03T09:47:00.000Z	ogra	piratePenguin	no guarantee for hoary though, since upstream seems dead
2005-02-03T09:48:00.000Z	piratePenguin	ogra	http://rafb.net/paste/results/Q5uBCV41.html ... btw, do you have capiinit ?
2005-02-03T09:50:00.000Z	ogra	piratePenguin	its important that everything is in the described order and that you have absolutely no (obsolete) hisax stuff loaded
2005-02-03T09:51:00.000Z	piratePenguin	ogra	right.. I'll try again soon.. thanks
2005-02-03T09:51:00.000Z	ogra	piratePenguin	i assumer you are on warty
2005-02-03T09:52:00.000Z	ogra	piratePenguin	the isdn stuff for hoary isnt completely sorted yet..... but we will have the original avm drivers in there
2005-02-03T09:53:00.000Z	piratePenguin	ogra	haven't got a clue what warty means.... but I've seen it somwhere on my pc, so yea, I think so
2005-02-03T09:54:00.000Z	ogra	piratePenguin	warty is the current release, hoary is the current development branch
2005-02-03T09:54:00.000Z	piratePenguin	ogra	oh.. well then I must be on warty
