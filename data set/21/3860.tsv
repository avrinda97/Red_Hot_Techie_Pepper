2008-10-15T13:09:00.000Z	lakhra		as trier is at the other end of germany from here, that is not perfect, but it will do
2008-10-15T13:10:00.000Z	jim_p	lakhra	ok then
2008-10-15T12:46:00.000Z	jim_p	lakhra	give me a sec to search. i had found it a month ago
2008-10-15T12:47:00.000Z	lakhra	jim_p	thank you :)
2008-10-15T12:52:00.000Z	jim_p	lakhra	since i cand find the file, can we go the gnome way?
2008-10-15T12:52:00.000Z	lakhra	jim_p	uh, yeah as long as the programs for that are already installed (no DNS, no apt-get ...)
2008-10-15T12:52:00.000Z	jim_p	lakhra	no gui?
2008-10-15T12:53:00.000Z	lakhra	jim_p	fluxbox
2008-10-15T12:53:00.000Z	jim_p	lakhra	let me search more
2008-10-15T12:53:00.000Z	lakhra	jim_p	but i think i did not remove all the gnome programs
2008-10-15T12:55:00.000Z	jim_p	lakhra	sudo network-admin
2008-10-15T12:55:00.000Z	jim_p	lakhra	does it work?
2008-10-15T12:57:00.000Z	lakhra	jim_p	yes, does work
2008-10-15T12:57:00.000Z	jim_p	lakhra	there you go then
2008-10-15T12:57:00.000Z	lakhra	jim_p	just, everything is grayed out. i do see the currently used DNS and everything -- i simply can't change it :(
2008-10-15T12:57:00.000Z	jim_p	lakhra	not even with sudo?
2008-10-15T13:09:00.000Z	lakhra	jim_p	ok,  thanks, at least i now have semi-working dns again with dns.uni-trier.de
2008-10-15T13:10:00.000Z	jim_p	lakhra	i use my isps dns servers. is there any difference?
2008-10-15T13:10:00.000Z	lakhra	jim_p	well, dunno, i dont even know what their dns is ;) never used it, dunno why
2008-10-15T13:11:00.000Z	jim_p	lakhra	i used it so as to be 100% sure that i have done every single step the isp support may ask me to
2008-10-15T13:20:00.000Z	lakhra	jim_p	interestingly, though, this other dns server seems to block some sites
