2005-10-22T13:24:00.000Z	firestorm		Howdy. When I run apt-get update I need to have my http_proxy env variable set. I have this in /etc/profile but that isn't sourced upon startup. Any hints as to how I should tell apt to use my http_proxy or otherwise get /etc/profile sourced on startup?
2005-10-22T13:25:00.000Z	dooglus	firestorm	/etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh is sourced at boot time
2005-10-22T13:26:00.000Z	firestorm	dooglus	thanks
2005-10-22T13:27:00.000Z	dooglus	firestorm	but... you can set a proxy using system->admin->network-proxy
2005-10-22T13:29:00.000Z	dooglus	firestorm	in GNOME, the system menu is in the top left corner
2005-10-22T13:29:00.000Z	firestorm	dooglus	ahhh...using KDE :)
2005-10-22T13:30:00.000Z	dooglus	firestorm	the command is 'gnome-network-preferences' - but I don't know if that will work in KDE...
2005-10-22T13:31:00.000Z	firestorm	dooglus	yup that works..thanks :)
2005-10-22T13:34:00.000Z	dooglus	firestorm	what kind of terminals?
2005-10-22T13:34:00.000Z	firestorm	dooglus	xterm and konsole
2005-10-22T13:34:00.000Z	dooglus	firestorm	for konsole you might try asking in #kubuntu
2005-10-22T13:35:00.000Z	dooglus	firestorm	for xterm, hold control and press middle-mouse-button - there's a menu to select 'visual bell'
2005-10-22T13:35:00.000Z	firestorm	dooglus	thanks again :)
2005-10-22T13:36:00.000Z	dooglus	firestorm	xterm also has a "-vb" option, to set "visual bell"
2005-10-22T13:38:00.000Z	dooglus	firestorm	actually, I don't hear any beeps from xterm at all - I must have turned off the beeper somehow.  I don't see it flash either.  Not sure what I've done.  Maybe the hardware beeper is broken?
2005-10-22T13:40:00.000Z	firestorm	dooglus	i feel like breaking mine :P
2005-10-22T13:40:00.000Z	dooglus	firestorm	I just tried in a virtual console - it's silent there too
2005-10-22T13:43:00.000Z	dooglus	firestorm	did you try "xset -b"?  that turns the bell off
2005-10-22T13:44:00.000Z	firestorm	dooglus	that worked! thanks
2005-10-22T13:45:00.000Z	dooglus	firestorm	welcome.  anything else?
2005-10-22T13:45:00.000Z	firestorm	dooglus	nope that is all for now :)  bye
