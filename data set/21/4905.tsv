2008-01-19T19:54:00.000Z	CyberGabber	lvoicu_	Do you run a dhcp-server in your network (e.g. dhcp on yor router ) ? is the dhcp up&running?
2008-01-19T19:55:00.000Z	lvoicu_	CyberGabber	it\s a TV internet cable from ISP :-)
2008-01-19T19:55:00.000Z	lvoicu_	CyberGabber	and they gave me a modem motorola
2008-01-19T19:57:00.000Z	CyberGabber	lvoicu_	So you don't use an hardware-router of hardware-firewall ?, you just plugged yor network-cable from computer to Moterola ?
2008-01-19T19:57:00.000Z	lvoicu_	CyberGabber	exactly!!!
2008-01-19T19:57:00.000Z	lvoicu_	CyberGabber	the same I do with this windows laptop
2008-01-19T19:58:00.000Z	lvoicu_	CyberGabber	dmesg says: [ 4997.246767] eth0: link up, 100Mbps, full-duplex, lpa 0x41E1
2008-01-19T19:58:00.000Z	lvoicu_		[ 5007.972279] eth0: no IPv6 routers present
2008-01-19T19:58:00.000Z	lvoicu_	CyberGabber	could be a ipv6 problem?
2008-01-19T19:58:00.000Z	CyberGabber	lvoicu_	Not very safe, but it should be working. First you have to be sure that the motorala is getting an IP-adress from your ISP ( Check the doc's and Led's at the motoralo ).
2008-01-19T19:59:00.000Z	lvoicu_	CyberGabber	the leds are on, all of them!
2008-01-19T20:08:00.000Z	CyberGabber	lvoicu_	Does your windows /ip-traffic works well at the motorola ?
2008-01-19T20:08:00.000Z	lvoicu_	CyberGabber	windows works OK
2008-01-19T20:11:00.000Z	CyberGabber	lvoicu_	Maybe you want give it a try to disable IPV6 ? Look at : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=87798 , search on that site on 'mhael', he tells how to disable it.
2008-01-19T20:20:00.000Z	lvoicu_	CyberGabber	i've done it, now I reboot
2008-01-19T20:23:00.000Z	CyberGabber	lvoicu_	Cross your fingers ;-)
2008-01-19T20:37:00.000Z	CyberGabber	lvoicu_	Making progress ??
