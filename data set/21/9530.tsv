2005-11-05T11:18:00.000Z	robotgeek	hawking	put all the things you want to bring up at boot (if they are services), in a script, and put it in /etc/init.d/ and add to runtime by using the update-rc.d command
2005-11-05T11:18:00.000Z	hawking	robotgeek	with script you mean a shell script or any kind of script?
2005-11-05T11:19:00.000Z	robotgeek	hawking	usually they are shell, but my guess is that any would work
2005-11-05T11:20:00.000Z	hawking	robotgeek	what do i have to put in the beginning of a shell script I mean in python for example I put #!/usr/bin/python
