2008-10-20T07:49:00.000Z	Orbixx	jclbrt	Resizing windows partition?
2008-10-20T07:49:00.000Z	jclbrt	Orbixx	any partition
2008-10-20T07:49:00.000Z	Orbixx		I had a bad experience with resizing an NTFS partition with gparted.
2008-10-20T07:49:00.000Z	Orbixx		Specifically, it crashed and my NTFS partition was shot.
2008-10-20T07:50:00.000Z	jclbrt	Orbixx	I've never had a problem
2008-10-20T07:50:00.000Z	jclbrt		except once i lost my boot record
2008-10-20T07:50:00.000Z	Orbixx	jclbrt	Could've just been me - I just assumed it must happen often.
2008-10-20T07:50:00.000Z	jclbrt		but i was able to get that back
2008-10-20T07:50:00.000Z	Orbixx		It was the first time I used gparted to resize anything.
2008-10-20T07:50:00.000Z	jclbrt		as long as he does not delete his partition he should be fine
2008-10-20T07:51:00.000Z	Orbixx	jclbrt	I got my partition back too by recovering the raw data and using software to recognise the data and split them into files appropriately.
