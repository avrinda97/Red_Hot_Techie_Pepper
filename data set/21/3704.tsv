2008-10-18T18:47:00.000Z	mib_tvm1bc		i cant disable the bluetooth module
2008-10-18T18:47:00.000Z	mib_tvm1bc		in the install cd
2008-10-18T18:47:00.000Z	mib_tvm1bc		but i cant install
2008-10-18T18:47:00.000Z	mib_tvm1bc		since it just hangs
2008-10-18T18:47:00.000Z	mib_tvm1bc		doesnt recognize the bluetooth model or soemthing
2008-10-18T18:47:00.000Z	mib_tvm1bc		i dont even possess a bluetooth module you know
2008-10-18T18:48:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mib_tvm1bc	Are you on a laptop? Have you checked in the bios if it lists bluetooth under integrated peripherals and if it's possible to disable it there?
2008-10-18T18:48:00.000Z	mib_tvm1bc	BlueEagle	yes i am. i have no bluetooth in there
2008-10-18T18:49:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mib_tvm1bc	Well if it fails then the bluetooth module shouldn't try to load at all and thus it shouldn't hang.
2008-10-18T18:49:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mib_tvm1bc	How did you come to the conclusion that it was the bluetooth module that is hanging the system?
2008-10-18T18:50:00.000Z	mib_tvm1bc	BlueEagle	since it says STARTING BLUETOOTH or something and then it hangs
2008-10-18T18:50:00.000Z	mib_tvm1bc	BlueEagle	 before there were other things that got completet with an [OK]
2008-10-18T18:51:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mib_tvm1bc	How long did you wait for it before deducing that it hung? You may also want to try disabling your wireless network card and hook up with a wired connection during the install.
2008-10-18T18:51:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mib_tvm1bc	This is not supposed to cause the error, but I cannot rule it out either.
2008-10-18T18:51:00.000Z	mib_tvm1bc	BlueEagle	about 15minutes
2008-10-18T18:51:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mib_tvm1bc	Well it should have timed out by then.
2008-10-18T18:52:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mib_tvm1bc	Best of luck.
2008-10-18T18:52:00.000Z	mib_tvm1bc	BlueEagle	ok maybe it was only 3 minutes
2008-10-18T18:52:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mib_tvm1bc	It should time out at approx 45 seconds and then fail graceously.
2008-10-18T18:52:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mib_tvm1bc	Never had the problem so it's hard for me to say.
