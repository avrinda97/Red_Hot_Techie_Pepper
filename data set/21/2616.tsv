2009-08-25T21:59:00.000Z	linuxson25		Hi everyone
2009-08-25T22:00:00.000Z	linuxson25		Got a bit of a log in situation with my desktop pc
2009-08-25T22:01:00.000Z	linuxson25		Just finished editing my new blog, and when I tried starting up Thunderbird, wouldnt launch, along with any other application
2009-08-25T22:02:00.000Z	linuxson25		Tried logging out, and it just gave a whole lot of jibberish on the screen, and when I tried cli, I couldnt log in
2009-08-25T22:02:00.000Z	linuxson25		As soon as I type in my username, it just resets, and asks for it again
2009-08-25T22:03:00.000Z	linuxson25		Rebooted the pc, and now when I try cli, it gives me a whole lot of EXT3-fs inode read errors
2009-08-25T22:03:00.000Z	linuxson25		Why is that?
2009-08-25T22:04:00.000Z	raylu	linuxson25	i'd suggest putting in a livecd and fsck-ing your partition
2009-08-25T22:05:00.000Z	linuxson25	raylu	What does fsck do?
2009-08-25T22:05:00.000Z	raylu	linuxson25	filesystem check
2009-08-25T22:05:00.000Z	linuxson25	raylu	Hmmmm....okay, will try this
2009-08-25T22:05:00.000Z	linuxson25	raylu	Thanx
2009-08-25T22:25:00.000Z	raylu	linuxson25	are you sure it's an ext filesystem? what does fdisk -l say?
2009-08-25T22:26:00.000Z	linuxson25	raylu	Doesnt say anything
2009-08-25T22:29:00.000Z	linuxson25	raylu	OH....when trying to browse the drive now, it gives a connot mount error: wrong fs type, bad superblock
2009-08-25T22:30:00.000Z	linuxson25	raylu	this bad?
2009-08-25T22:31:00.000Z	raylu	linuxson25	can you pastebin the output of "fdisk -l" and "gparted -l"? perhaps you got no output because you didn't run it as root
2009-08-25T22:32:00.000Z	linuxson25	raylu	Ok...didnt do that....lol
2009-08-25T22:33:00.000Z	linuxson25	raylu	and on gparted gives an I/O error
2009-08-25T22:34:00.000Z	linuxson25	raylu	gives the info with fdisk -l. Can see the Linux prts, and swap
2009-08-25T22:35:00.000Z	raylu	linuxson25	prts?
