2008-06-19T02:24:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	QAH	Got a usb keyboard ?
2008-06-19T02:24:00.000Z	QAH	EvilDennisR	Yes I do
2008-06-19T02:25:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	QAH	Thats probably why you can't move around the boot menu
2008-06-19T02:25:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	QAH	grab a ps2 keyboard and use that to select what you want
2008-06-19T02:25:00.000Z	QAH	EvilDennisR	Is there a way to fix that without having a ps/2 kb?
2008-06-19T02:25:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	QAH	Nope. I'm guessing you have a usb keyboard with all the extra funky media keys on it?
2008-06-19T02:26:00.000Z	QAH	EvilDennisR	Yup you got it
2008-06-19T02:26:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	QAH	Your usb keyboard will work once the boot starts, but the grub menu gets retarded for weird usb keyboards like yours sometimes
2008-06-19T02:26:00.000Z	QAH	EvilDennisR	Can I download a live cd for the new linux 8.04?
2008-06-19T02:27:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	QAH	What cd do you have already ?
2008-06-19T02:27:00.000Z	QAH	EvilDennisR	I have the Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) Live Cd
2008-06-19T02:27:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	QAH	Yeah, grab the 8.04 cd
2008-06-19T02:28:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	QAH	Theres a possibility that your usb keyboard will work in the menu, but I can't promis anything. 8.04 is the latest version anyways, 7.10 is stale
2008-06-19T02:28:00.000Z	QAH	EvilDennisR	I downloaded the 7.10 iso and burned it to my own cd myself. Can I do that with 8.04, or do I have to request a cd?
2008-06-19T02:28:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	QAH	Nope, you can download the iso just as you did the last one
2008-06-19T02:29:00.000Z	QAH	EvilDennisR	Can you please give me the link. I can't seem to find it for the life of me.
2008-06-19T02:30:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	QAH	http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
2008-06-19T02:30:00.000Z	QAH	EvilDennisR	Thanks a lot man.
2008-06-19T02:30:00.000Z	QAH	EvilDennisR	Is 8.04 a great improvement over 7.10?
2008-06-19T02:31:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	QAH	Updated programs.. So yes
2008-06-19T02:31:00.000Z	QAH	EvilDennisR	Okay. Thanks a lot
