2010-01-20T03:14:00.000Z	hwilde	kri1987	sudo chown yourname:yourname somefile        <-- that will give you permissions
2010-01-20T03:09:00.000Z	hwilde	kri1987	he wants you to type   "ls -al | pastebinit"
2010-01-20T03:10:00.000Z	hwilde	kri1987	that will take the output of the "ls -al" command and send it to pastebin, that will return a link, and copy and paste that link here for us
2010-01-20T03:11:00.000Z	hwilde	kri1987	try to respond to the person you are talking to, like for example I put your name first on this line
2010-01-20T03:12:00.000Z	hwilde	kri1987	try to type all on one line and not hit enter for punctuation... lotta people in this chat
2010-01-20T03:13:00.000Z	kri1987	hwilde	sorry bout that. I created a folder called test. Put permissions as 777. I've noticed that none of the users have access to the home dir anymore. I'm using ubuntu server. So it may have some se linux policy or something... but it's very strange. I've tried chmod 777 and chown to my user as well

2010-01-20T03:15:00.000Z	kri1987	hwilde	didn't work. I still have permission denied
2010-01-20T03:17:00.000Z	kri1987	hwilde	actually.. no, that looks like it is working
2010-01-20T03:17:00.000Z	kri1987	hwilde	i'll get back to you... let me try recursively do it for a few folders
2010-01-20T03:18:00.000Z	hwilde	kri1987	-r option is recursive.
