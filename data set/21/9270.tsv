2006-02-28T16:55:00.000Z	mustard5	nelsmar	try reading over that guide and just changing the commands to suit your system
2006-02-28T16:55:00.000Z	mustard5	nelsmar	if you get lost I can show you how
2006-02-28T16:56:00.000Z	mustard5	nelsmar	:)
2006-02-28T16:57:00.000Z	mustard5	nelsmar	you can always create a backup before you edit something...its a good practice
2006-02-28T16:58:00.000Z	mustard5	nelsmar	not sure about that question. :)
2006-02-28T16:58:00.000Z	mustard5	nelsmar	its pretty unusual :D
