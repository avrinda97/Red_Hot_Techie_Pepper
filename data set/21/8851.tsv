2005-12-31T15:19:00.000Z	youngcoder	faisal_d	what kind of network install are you talking about having to do?
2005-12-31T15:20:00.000Z	faisal_d	youngcoder	i have no idea... what i want is this: http://udk.openoffice.org/python/oood/ and it requires a net install... probably to allow others in your domain to use your OO installation
2005-12-31T15:22:00.000Z	youngcoder	faisal_d	ok so u downloaded the zip file and unzipped it and got what errors?
2005-12-31T15:23:00.000Z	faisal_d	youngcoder	in the first step the setup -d ... it keeps on saying command not found... and i am in the openoffice directory
2005-12-31T15:27:00.000Z	youngcoder	faisal_d	did you start a new multi-user installation by using         start $ setup -net
2005-12-31T15:28:00.000Z	faisal_d	youngcoder	no... that's my question... how do i do that? it's not accepting the command.. and i did a normal apt-get install for openoffice 1.9
2005-12-31T15:31:00.000Z	youngcoder	faisal_d	i dont know what to tell you i hae never tried this before
2005-12-31T15:32:00.000Z	faisal_d	youngcoder	thanx for trying anyway :)
2005-12-31T15:32:00.000Z	youngcoder	faisal_d	well the wierd command make me wonder tho
2005-12-31T15:32:00.000Z	faisal_d	youngcoder	thank you, so i am not going insane? you too think it's weird :-D
2005-12-31T15:33:00.000Z	youngcoder	faisal_d	i it was copied from an email so there must be some kind of error in the command
2005-12-31T15:34:00.000Z	faisal_d	youngcoder	if only i could find the original e-mail
2005-12-31T15:34:00.000Z	youngcoder	faisal_d	lol ya no kidding.. you could contact the site and ask them what the heck they are thinking tho
2005-12-31T15:38:00.000Z	faisal_d	youngcoder	no... i thought i needed the OO binaries...
2005-12-31T15:38:00.000Z	faisal_d	youngcoder	going to try it now, thanx for the idea... never crossed my mind
2005-12-31T15:39:00.000Z	faisal_d	youngcoder	ah, i just rememberd, how do you open a python shell??
