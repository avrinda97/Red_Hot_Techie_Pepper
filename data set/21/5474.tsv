2009-08-08T23:18:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x		Does anyone in here use Twitter? Because I can't get it to work from Firefox on my Ubuntu laptop
2009-08-08T23:18:00.000Z	eboyjr	xTheGoat121x	I do. What's up?
2009-08-08T23:19:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	eboyjr	I can use Gwibber to Tweet, which is fine, don't get me wrong, but sometimes I just want to use Firefox...
2009-08-08T23:19:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	eboyjr	ever since the hack, Fx doesn't work when I try to Tweet.
2009-08-08T23:19:00.000Z	eboyjr	xTheGoat121x	Yes I know what you mean :) What problems specifically are you having with Firefox?
2009-08-08T23:20:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	eboyjr	well, I'll type out the Tweet, click update... and nothing happens. It just sits there, acting like it's loading. I let it sit for over half an hour yesterday, and no Tweet.
2009-08-08T23:22:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	eboyjr	I tried clearing the cache and even deleting all my cookies. Nothing. Plus, I know it's not a general Fx problem, b/c it works on Windows.
2009-08-08T23:22:00.000Z	eboyjr	xTheGoat121x	It is working fine for me as expected. Can you tell me the release of Ubuntu, whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit?
2009-08-08T23:23:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	eboyjr	I'm running Intrepid (8.10), the 32-bit version
2009-08-08T23:24:00.000Z	eboyjr	xTheGoat121x	What version of Firefox?
2009-08-08T23:25:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	eboyjr	3.0.11
2009-08-08T23:26:00.000Z	eboyjr	xTheGoat121x	That is very strange. Okay. What about the add-ons you have installed and any plugins? You can PM me.
2009-08-09T00:08:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	eboyjr	guess what? The update didn't help
2009-08-09T00:08:00.000Z	eboyjr	xTheGoat121x	Awh :( Okay. Start firefox in safe mode (firefox --safe-mode) and tell me if it helps
2009-08-09T00:10:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	eboyjr	doesn't help.
2009-08-09T00:11:00.000Z	eboyjr	xTheGoat121x	Wow now I have reason to believe it is a combination of your network speed and Twitter's programming that is causing the problem
2009-08-09T00:12:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	eboyjr	well, it's DSL -- it's never been an issue before! And it's not an issue on Windows.
2009-08-09T00:12:00.000Z	eboyjr	xTheGoat121x	Before what?
2009-08-09T00:14:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	eboyjr	as I had mentioned in my previous comments -- this all worked before Twitter got hacked.
2009-08-09T00:15:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	eboyjr	seeing as it's unrelated to Ubuntu, I didn't mention -- I also cannot Tweet from my phone any longer, either.
2009-08-09T00:17:00.000Z	eboyjr	xTheGoat121x	http://twitter.com/eboyjr I dont know what else to think of. It is working for me
