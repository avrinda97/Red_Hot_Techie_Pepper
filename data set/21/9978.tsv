2005-06-05T14:38:00.000Z	Amaranth		Actually if you aren't a hardcore gamer the best video card for linux would be the Radeon 9200
2005-06-05T14:38:00.000Z	Amaranth		because the Radeon 9200 is the last Radeon that has an open source driver
2005-06-05T14:40:00.000Z	raDeon	Amaranth	what can i do for you
2005-06-05T14:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	raDeon	?
2005-06-05T14:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	raDeon	Nothing, I was talking about the video card. :)
2005-06-05T15:17:00.000Z	Amaranth	raDeon	Please don't do that again.
2005-06-06T11:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	raDeon	Change your nick and you don't have problems. :)
2005-06-06T11:13:00.000Z	Amaranth	raDeon	Why are you named after them then?
2005-06-06T11:13:00.000Z	Amaranth	raDeon	That's not nice.
2005-06-06T11:13:00.000Z	raDeon	Amaranth	im not the one to ask about that, you need to speak to my parents
2005-06-06T11:14:00.000Z	Amaranth	raDeon	I love the video card though. :D
2005-06-09T13:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	raDeon	Please don't do that.
2005-06-11T11:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	raDeon	Either calm down or change your nick to something that isn't a video card.

2005-06-12T09:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	raDeon	I'm beginning to think you're only here to troll.
2005-06-12T09:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	raDeon	You'll get them when breezy ships. ;)
2005-06-12T09:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	raDeon	Do you have a use for 30?
