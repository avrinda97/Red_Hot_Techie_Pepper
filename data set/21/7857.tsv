2007-02-15T06:36:00.000Z	Ireclan		I've got an apparent bug in the update manager that I'm VERY unhappy about...
2007-02-15T06:36:00.000Z	bruenig	Ireclan	doubt it is "in the update manager"
2007-02-15T06:37:00.000Z	Ireclan	bruenig	shall I describe the bug?
2007-02-15T06:38:00.000Z	bruenig	Ireclan	I was thinking you would, but ball is ultimately in your court
2007-02-15T06:43:00.000Z	bruenig	Ireclan	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2007-02-15T06:49:00.000Z	Ireclan	bruenig	what good does that do me? I'm on dial-up, It stands to reason that if 37 MB is a problem, 157 MB will be too...
2007-02-15T06:53:00.000Z	bruenig	Ireclan	do that command
2007-02-15T06:54:00.000Z	bruenig	Ireclan	well just sudo apt-get install whatever you want from those
2007-02-19T09:10:00.000Z	bruenig	Ireclan	it is a go to that link and see how to enable it
2007-02-19T09:13:00.000Z	bruenig	Ireclan	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression#head-6dd82717a35bf41459736ab63ba07a39875c0636
2007-02-19T09:15:00.000Z	bruenig	Ireclan	I am sure you can always do it from command line, let me see
2007-02-19T09:16:00.000Z	bruenig	Ireclan	you should be able to do p7zip -d whatever.7z
2007-02-19T09:18:00.000Z	Ireclan	bruenig	do I need to "cd" to the directory it's in before performing that command?
2007-02-19T09:19:00.000Z	bruenig	Ireclan	yeah, or you can just do "p7zip -d /path/to/whatever.7z"
2007-03-16T14:21:00.000Z	bruenig	Ireclan	right, they are codecs not plugins though, but yeah
2007-03-16T14:23:00.000Z	Ireclan	bruenig	but in order to play back DVDs and WMA/WMV I have to intstall from third party?
2007-03-16T14:23:00.000Z	bruenig	Ireclan	for encrypted dvds yes
2007-04-10T06:22:00.000Z	bruenig	Ireclan	sudo apt-get autoremove openoffice.org
2007-04-10T06:22:00.000Z	Ireclan	bruenig	I want to do it through Synaptic.
2007-04-10T06:23:00.000Z	bruenig	Ireclan	well then do it, why ask
2007-04-10T06:23:00.000Z	Ireclan	bruenig	Because it's giving me hassels.
