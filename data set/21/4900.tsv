2008-03-06T17:07:00.000Z	usr13		Getting error:  "Ubuntu is running in Low-Graphics mode"  I installed Nvidia drivers from Nvidia and it appears that the package manager did away with it.  How is the best/easiest way to fix this?
2008-03-06T17:09:00.000Z	usr13		I guess Ubuntu repos have nvidia-glx and nvidia-kernel-source packages and we need to stick with that instead of downloading Nvidia drivers from nvidia.com.  Right?  I screwed up; Right?
2008-03-06T17:10:00.000Z	usr13		Go ahead and tell me I screwed up. I'm a big boy, I can take it!  :)
2008-03-06T17:11:00.000Z	danand	usr13	- you may well have screwed up :P
2008-03-06T17:11:00.000Z	usr13	danand	Thanks :)  I knew that!  :)
2008-03-06T17:13:00.000Z	danand	usr13	- i can tell you you've screwed up .... just can't tell you how to fix it :)
2008-03-06T17:13:00.000Z	usr13	danand	That's ok.  I can fix anything.
2008-03-06T17:15:00.000Z	danand	usr13	- if your anything like me ... first i have it working... tinker a bit ... tinker a bit more ... break it .... then spend days putting it back to how you had it in the first place XO
2008-03-06T17:16:00.000Z	danand	usr13	- are you sure the nvidia module is being loaded - check lsmod. if you can't find it add the correct name of the nvidia driver you compiled to /etc/modules
2008-03-06T17:19:00.000Z	danand	usr13	- i think the nvidia install script removes the standard nvidia kernel modules to avoid the system using those.... if you haven't then told the system to use the new gfx modules (perhaps with a different name?) that would explain why your running in low gfx mode. check the output of dmesg to see if you get any errors about missing nvidia modules
2008-03-06T17:20:00.000Z	usr13	danand	Ok...
2008-03-19T22:42:00.000Z	danand	usr13	- uh oh :O
2008-03-19T22:30:00.000Z	danand	usr13	- that should be in the kernel - no need to download any driver
2008-03-19T22:33:00.000Z	danand	usr13	- is that a brand new card from 3com - i think i may have got my 5 and 9 mixed up .... theres a kernel module for 3c59x, but i can't see one for 3c95x :(
2008-03-19T22:34:00.000Z	usr13	danand	Maybe pre-compiled into the kernel nowdays.
2008-03-19T22:36:00.000Z	usr13	danand	dep:  It was working before... not sure what I've done, but have uninstalled a few packages and now, no eth0
2008-03-19T22:37:00.000Z	danand	usr13	- do you remember what packages you removed?
2008-03-19T22:37:00.000Z	usr13	danand	Yes
2008-03-19T22:38:00.000Z	danand	usr13	- k
2008-03-19T22:38:00.000Z	danand	usr13	- k :)
2008-03-19T22:41:00.000Z	danand	usr13	- errr....
