2008-02-12T13:48:00.000Z	Werdna		Hi, I'm trying to install ubuntu on a system with no cd-rom drive, unable to boot from usb with syslinux (but it can read the drive), and a floppy drive. I've copied the contents of the ubuntu cd to my USB drive, and I'm trying to boot into it via a floppy drive. How can I talk syslinux into booting a kernel on external media (such as a usb storage device)?

2008-02-12T13:49:00.000Z	Werdna	sweetsinse	how'd you do it?
2008-02-12T13:49:00.000Z	Werdna	sweetsinse	remember anything about it?
2008-02-12T13:59:00.000Z	sweetsinse	Werdna	you there
2008-02-12T14:03:00.000Z	Werdna	sweetsinse	yes
2008-02-12T14:04:00.000Z	Werdna	sweetsinse	cheers.
2008-02-12T14:05:00.000Z	sweetsinse	Werdna	that last part is important
2008-02-12T14:06:00.000Z	Werdna	sweetsinse	I have rawrite, I'm in windows now :P
2008-02-12T14:12:00.000Z	Werdna	sweetsinse	didn't work. my files are on a USB drive, which it wouldn't talk to.
2008-02-12T14:14:00.000Z	Werdna	sweetsinse	the 700MB ubuntu install disk. I can't find my damn USB CD-ROM drive. I've copied the files themselves onto a USB disk, and I want to run it.
2008-02-12T14:15:00.000Z	Werdna	sweetsinse	I've determined that if syslinux would work on that disk, I'd be in business.
2008-02-12T14:15:00.000Z	sweetsinse	Werdna	why not use floppy to boot cd, what were you trying to do again
2008-02-12T14:16:00.000Z	Werdna	sweetsinse	Install ubuntu. I don't have a CD drive for this computer (it's a laptop)
2008-02-12T14:20:00.000Z	sweetsinse	Werdna	do you have a floppy though on that lappy
2008-02-12T14:25:00.000Z	Werdna	sweetsinse	yes.
2008-02-12T14:26:00.000Z	sweetsinse	Werdna	i dont know, maybe sbm can pass boot to usb also?
2008-02-12T14:26:00.000Z	Werdna	sweetsinse	nope.
2008-02-12T14:41:00.000Z	Werdna	sweetsinse	any ideas?
2008-02-12T14:44:00.000Z	sweetsinse	Werdna	i dont suppose youve poked around your bios for usb support...haha wishful thinking?
2008-02-12T14:47:00.000Z	Werdna	sweetsinse	well, it HAS usb support, but I've tried numerous syslinux-based methods to boot from it, and all I get is 'Boot error'
