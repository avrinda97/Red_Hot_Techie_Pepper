2010-07-29T05:26:00.000Z	webchat		why does cat /proc/cpuinfo report 2.6ghz under load even though my cpu is overclocked to 3.2ghz?
2010-07-29T05:26:00.000Z	arrrghhh	webchat	how are you oc'ing it?
2010-07-29T05:27:00.000Z	webchat	arrrghhh	fsb increase, it shows 3.2ghz under both bios and cpu-z under windows
2010-07-29T05:27:00.000Z	arrrghhh	webchat	perhaps.  i'm not sure what that value reads tbh.
2010-07-29T05:27:00.000Z	webchat	arrrghhh	well, my cpu can't even be set to 2.6ghz under the current fsb
2010-07-29T05:28:00.000Z	arrrghhh	webchat	what is the chip clocked at from the factory?
2010-07-29T05:28:00.000Z	webchat	arrrghhh	2.6ghz, so I guess it's reading hardware strings rather than actual clock speed
2010-07-29T05:29:00.000Z	webchat	arrrghhh	dmesg says [    0.000000] Detected 3218.389 MHz processor.
2010-07-29T05:29:00.000Z	arrrghhh	webchat	there you go.
2010-07-29T05:29:00.000Z	webchat	arrrghhh	then [    1.195928] powernow-k8:    0 : pstate 0 (2600 MHz)
2010-07-29T05:37:00.000Z	webchat	arrrghhh	but it has no gpu acceleration?
2010-07-29T05:37:00.000Z	arrrghhh	webchat	what.
2010-07-29T05:52:00.000Z	arrrghhh	webchat	qt and gnome have never really played well together.  just like kde and gtk+.  they work, but not perfectly.
2010-07-29T05:54:00.000Z	arrrghhh	webchat	i explained it but you rudely "closed the page"
2010-07-29T05:55:00.000Z	webchat	arrrghhh	apologies, freenode webchat + firefox doesn't seem to be reliable
2010-07-29T05:55:00.000Z	arrrghhh	webchat	qt and gnome have never really played well together.  just like kde and gtk+.  they work, but not perfectly.  and no worries.
2010-07-29T05:55:00.000Z	webchat	arrrghhh	ic, so gtk apps wouldn't use those balloons?
2010-07-29T05:56:00.000Z	webchat	arrrghhh	is there any planned "fix" for better integration?
2010-07-29T05:56:00.000Z	arrrghhh	webchat	uhm... sure?  i'm not sure.  i just know they've never historically played well together.  they're always getting better...
2010-07-29T05:57:00.000Z	webchat	arrrghhh	it looks like tray balloon notifications are a Qt creation, gtk apps directly call libnotify
2010-07-29T06:02:00.000Z	arrrghhh	webchat	or just run kde haha :P
