2007-07-09T09:50:00.000Z	ari_stress		how do i activate the GUI in dapper?
2007-07-09T09:51:00.000Z	Flannel	ari_stress	Which CD did you use to install?  since a GUI installs by default on all except server version.
2007-07-09T09:51:00.000Z	ari_stress	Flannel	i use the alternate cd, is there any gui in the cd?
2007-07-09T09:52:00.000Z	Flannel	ari_stress	The alternate CD can install both a text-mode only (server edition) and a GUI (the normal install
2007-07-09T09:52:00.000Z	Flannel	ari_stress	But the installation is textmode only.  But you are installing a GUI system
2007-07-09T09:52:00.000Z	ari_stress	Flannel	actually i don't need gui, if apt-get will ask me for some setup if installing certain packages such as libnss-ldap
2007-07-09T09:53:00.000Z	ari_stress	Flannel	the tutorial i'm reading is suggesting me to use synaptic to install things, so that it will ask for some additional info to set things up
2007-07-09T09:53:00.000Z	Flannel	ari_stress	Oh, uh, all package managers will ask you stuff if synaptic does
2007-07-09T09:54:00.000Z	ari_stress	Flannel	i'll try from CLI
2007-09-03T07:50:00.000Z	Flannel	ari_stress	dpkg -l (it's long)
2007-09-05T08:41:00.000Z	Flannel	ari_stress	it can be
2007-09-05T08:42:00.000Z	ari_stress	Flannel	how do i test it? will running a 64bit live cd prove it?
2007-09-05T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	ari_stress	Yep
2007-09-17T08:20:00.000Z	Flannel	ari_stress	you mean file, but, /dev/input is where they are
2007-09-17T08:21:00.000Z	Flannel	ari_stress	Its where keyboard input gets read from.  Its a little bit more complicated than "that's the keyboard" but yeah.
2007-09-17T08:22:00.000Z	ari_stress	Flannel	mm ok :)
2007-09-17T08:22:00.000Z	ari_stress	Flannel	i thought it would be something like /dev/kb /dev/ps2
2008-05-30T06:17:00.000Z	ari_stress	Flannel	is wubi somekind like vmnware?
2008-05-30T06:18:00.000Z	Flannel	ari_stress	no, wubi allows Ubuntu to live inside an NTFS partition
2009-01-06T12:03:00.000Z	Flannel	ari_stress	Is it an xlsx file?
2009-01-17T10:05:00.000Z	Flannel	ari_stress	Perhaps.  You should ask in #ubuntu+1
