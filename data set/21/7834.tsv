2006-07-29T09:44:00.000Z	SlyGuy		and they are all in the left corner
2006-07-29T09:44:00.000Z	SlyGuy		yeah?
2006-07-29T09:44:00.000Z	SlyGuy		hmm
2006-07-29T09:46:00.000Z	SlyGuy		well at least i got my video card working correctly tonight
2006-07-29T09:46:00.000Z	SlyGuy		i am now windows free for 2 months...
2006-07-29T09:47:00.000Z	SlyGuy		OSX and Ubuntu on my laptop
2006-07-29T09:47:00.000Z	SlyGuy		this version of linux is the first I have ever considered replacing windows with
2006-07-29T09:48:00.000Z	SlyGuy		the first version i ever installed was Slackware 3
2006-07-29T09:49:00.000Z	SlyGuy		VMWare is expensive ain't it? i could use windows in VM for VS.NET
2006-07-29T09:51:00.000Z	Terminus	SlyGuy	VMWare server is free as in beer.
2006-07-29T09:51:00.000Z	SlyGuy	Terminus	whats server do?
2006-07-29T09:51:00.000Z	Terminus	SlyGuy	you could use qemu if you don't want a 100mb download though.
2006-07-29T09:52:00.000Z	Terminus	SlyGuy	same stuff you can do with VMWare Workstation.
2006-07-29T09:52:00.000Z	Terminus	SlyGuy	that's already a lot. i haven't tried vmware in years though. qemu is good enough for my needs.
2006-07-29T09:53:00.000Z	Terminus	SlyGuy	qemu is also a VM and you can run almost any OS on it, from windows to bsd.
2006-07-29T09:54:00.000Z	Terminus	SlyGuy	around the same i guess. i'm using the kqemu accelerator though.
2006-07-29T09:55:00.000Z	Terminus	SlyGuy	if you're gonna use qemu, i'd suggest you build from sources. the one in the repos is quite old.
2006-07-29T09:56:00.000Z	Terminus	SlyGuy	it's a kernel accelerator for the VM.
2006-07-29T09:57:00.000Z	Terminus	SlyGuy	well, if you've got parallels, why not just use parallels?
2006-07-29T10:06:00.000Z	Terminus	SlyGuy	i think they're trying to go for the try before you buy marketing thing.
