2008-02-08T09:14:00.000Z	joh6nn	hanophix33	hard to say without being able to see it

2008-02-08T09:22:00.000Z	hanophix33	joh6nn	 you there?
2008-02-08T09:22:00.000Z	joh6nn	hanophix33	yep, taking a look now
2008-02-08T09:25:00.000Z	joh6nn	hanophix33	what happens if you press ctrl+- ?
2008-02-08T09:26:00.000Z	hanophix33	joh6nn	 thought u had it, but it doesn't format correctly until font isnt readable
2008-02-08T09:27:00.000Z	joh6nn	hanophix33	yeah, i figured as much.  the only thing that's wrong then, is just that 1024x768 isn't the optimal resolution for your monitor.  try setting it at a higher resolution
2008-02-08T09:30:00.000Z	joh6nn	hanophix33	then you're out of luck, i think.  ; (
2008-02-08T09:33:00.000Z	hanophix33	joh6nn	 did u see my last link
2008-02-08T09:33:00.000Z	joh6nn	hanophix33	yeah man. that sucks
2008-02-08T09:33:00.000Z	hanophix33	joh6nn	 yea
