2011-10-27T09:09:00.000Z	Equilibrium	gulzar	i'm trying to set minimize animation in ccsm. But it is'n working. Open and close animations are working
2011-10-27T09:10:00.000Z	gulzar	Equilibrium	try to change the time setting for minimize. Which effect you want?
2011-10-27T09:11:00.000Z	Equilibrium	gulzar	it is'n taking the effect at all. i click on new and then set all the settings and when i click on close. It is'n taking it.

2011-10-27T09:13:00.000Z	gulzar	Equilibrium	with 11.04 no problem. Try to change the effect and its timing . Try different effects. And do one refresh or logout
2011-10-27T09:14:00.000Z	gulzar	Equilibrium	if still not working then there is some big issue. but it should not be there
