2007-10-25T17:37:00.000Z	vegpuff		hi, i am using 7.10, and i am not able to use Xgl in ATI
2007-10-25T17:37:00.000Z	vegpuff		i have a ATI radeon
2007-10-25T17:38:00.000Z	deadheron	vegpuff	maybe you should take a look at ati linux driver 8.42 :) it support AIGLX
2007-10-25T17:38:00.000Z	vegpuff	deadheron	is it available from the ubuntu base, or do i have to download from the company's website?
2007-10-25T17:39:00.000Z	deadheron	vegpuff	its quite a complicated install, i can explain it to you in private chat
2007-10-25T17:39:00.000Z	vegpuff	deadheron	oh!
2007-10-25T17:39:00.000Z	vegpuff	deadheron	are you using one?
2007-10-25T17:39:00.000Z	deadheron	vegpuff	i already installed it yes
2007-10-25T17:40:00.000Z	vegpuff		i thought 7.10 automatically takes care of it for ATI as well :(
2007-10-25T17:40:00.000Z	deadheron	vegpuff	nope, when 7.10 came out, ati linux driver 8.42 wasnt released yet
2007-10-25T17:40:00.000Z	vegpuff	deadheron	uh :(
