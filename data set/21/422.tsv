2011-12-31T03:15:00.000Z	compitz		sorry..
2011-12-31T03:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	compitz	What happens currently when you boot the computer while holding shift?
2011-12-31T03:18:00.000Z	compitz	Jordan_U	it would switch from loading picture to text version, no way to type there, seconds later black screen
2011-12-31T03:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	compitz	What do you mean by "loading picture"?
2011-12-31T03:19:00.000Z	compitz	Jordan_U	 ubuntu, and 5 or six blinking balls under it
2011-12-31T03:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	compitz	Are you sure that your keyboard works at all?
2011-12-31T03:21:00.000Z	compitz	Jordan_U	 as you can see Im typing .-)
2011-12-31T03:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	compitz	You're currently working from the same machine?
2011-12-31T03:21:00.000Z	compitz	Jordan_U	would that change something?
2011-12-31T03:23:00.000Z	compitz	Jordan_U	 yes I am working there
2011-12-31T03:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	compitz	Unless you've changed your grub settings, grub's menu should show if shift is being held when grub loads. If that's not happening then grub isn't being told by the BIOS that the shift key is pressed. That could either happen because your keyboard isn't working (which is not the case) or your BIOS doesn't support your keyboard (so the follow up question is can you use your keyboard in BIOS menus before grub loads)?
2011-12-31T03:25:00.000Z	compitz	Jordan_U	, yes i can enter the bios menu and edit stuff there, for example
2011-12-31T03:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	compitz	And you've been holding shift from the moment you turn on the computer (you can even start holding shift before you turn the computer on, if your BIOS doesn't complain about a "stuck key" like they did in decades past).
2011-12-31T03:27:00.000Z	compitz	Jordan_U	 ill try that, does GRUB menu load then and i can start the recovery mode?
2011-12-31T03:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	compitz	Correct. And remember that you need to hold shift. If anyone told you that you're supposed to press and release it repeatedly they were mistaken.
2011-12-31T03:29:00.000Z	compitz	Jordan_U	 thanks, will you be on lateron?
2011-12-31T03:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	compitz	I don't know.
2011-12-31T03:30:00.000Z	compitz	Jordan_U	 well then thx for helping and a happy and healthy next year to you
2011-12-31T03:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	compitz	You're welcome, and same to you :)
2011-12-31T03:31:00.000Z	compitz	Jordan_U	thx
