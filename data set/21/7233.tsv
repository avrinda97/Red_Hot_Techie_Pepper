2007-03-04T16:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	riqz	It does
2007-03-04T16:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	riqz	None will work, I have tried Debian, Ubuntu, Even the WIndows install CD it  came with
2007-03-04T16:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	riqz	Automatix is the spawn of satin, honestly it can screw up your system.
2007-03-04T16:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	riqz	In the future though, avoid automatix, Yes I have with the Beryl question
2007-03-04T16:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	riqz	You can't have XGL AND AIGLX
2007-03-04T16:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	riqz	Yes, you do, just don't choose the XGL session when you log in
2007-03-04T16:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	riqz	Go click on sessions and choose Gnomw
2007-03-04T16:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	riqz	Yes
2007-03-04T16:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	riqz	That's because I mistyped "gnome" :)
2007-03-04T16:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	riqz	Yes, but you are on Gnome + XGL, you want _just_ Gnome
2007-03-04T16:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	riqz	Yes, what version of Ubuntu are you using?
