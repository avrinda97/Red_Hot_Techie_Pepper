2009-12-28T02:43:00.000Z	Alloosh1		hi, just installed fedora, I am ubuntu users, so now I have ubuntu on one partition and fedora on another, when I boot it goes directly to fedora, how can I choose OS to boot to before starting?
2009-12-28T02:44:00.000Z	odinsbane	Alloosh1	you'll have to reconfigure grub

2009-12-28T02:45:00.000Z	odinsbane	Alloosh1	it doesn't matter that its fedora, you can mount your other parition and reconfiure grub.  The easiest might be to see if fedora has a way to do it.
