2011-05-27T16:06:00.000Z	lifechamp		the 320GB HD shows up.. device: /dev/sda
2011-05-27T16:07:00.000Z	lifechamp		in fdisk -l i saw only sda devices, from sda1-9
2011-05-27T16:07:00.000Z	lifechamp		oh, in volumes it shows device: /dev/sda1
2011-05-27T16:07:00.000Z	lifechamp		i guess that's it then?
2011-05-27T16:08:00.000Z	lifechamp		sda1?
2011-05-27T16:08:00.000Z	VCoolio	lifechamp	run mount to check what is mounted as /
2011-05-27T16:09:00.000Z	VCoolio	lifechamp	it' s probably /dev/sda1, yeah
2011-05-27T16:10:00.000Z	lifechamp	VCoolio	does sda1 numbers look weird to you tho? ie, too small? http://paste.ubuntu.com/613683/
2011-05-27T16:11:00.000Z	VCoolio	lifechamp	6 Gb I think? That's ok
2011-05-27T16:11:00.000Z	lifechamp		for a 360GB drive? I guess the whole 360 would not show here?
2011-05-27T16:13:00.000Z	lifechamp		oh, wait, in disk utility, it shows in volumes for the 320gb drive, that unknown is 50gb, 25 and 40 gb ext4, 200gb unknown
2011-05-27T16:13:00.000Z	lifechamp		just fyi
2011-05-27T16:13:00.000Z	lifechamp	VCoolio	should i paste the DU GUI ss?
2011-05-27T16:13:00.000Z	lifechamp		or should i just figure answer to step 3 is sda1?
2011-05-27T16:13:00.000Z	lifechamp		https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#METHOD%203%20-%20CHROOT
2011-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	lifechamp		Ok, the "Bootable" partition flag is set for that sda1 device
2011-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	lifechamp		is that the "normal system partition" then?
2011-05-27T16:16:00.000Z	VCoolio	lifechamp	run "mount"  and paste that output
2011-05-27T16:16:00.000Z	lifechamp		i do, hh, but there are multiple selections to print out
2011-05-27T16:18:00.000Z	lifechamp	VCoolio	i'm running off of LiveCD (to fix bootup prob), so mount should none except for tmpfp, loop0, sr0, fusectl, auf, binfmt_misc, gvts... so prob doesn't have what you want me to see, right?
2011-05-27T16:19:00.000Z	VCoolio	lifechamp	yeah sorry, you' re fixing the stuff; nevermind
