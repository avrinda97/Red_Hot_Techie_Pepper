2008-09-01T00:17:00.000Z	npope-laptop	iamme	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg didnt seem to do anything... try switching to init 3 (sudo init 3) then reissue sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-09-01T00:17:00.000Z	iamme	npope-laptop	ok
2008-09-01T00:19:00.000Z	iamme	npope-laptop	doesnt change anything
2008-09-01T00:20:00.000Z	npope-laptop	iamme	grrr. whats your resolution 800x600?
2008-09-01T00:20:00.000Z	iamme	npope-laptop	it just asks about a kernel framebuffer and then goes to kb stuff and my res is 800x600
2008-09-01T00:21:00.000Z	npope-laptop	iamme	did this happen after the recent kernel upgrade?
2008-09-01T00:21:00.000Z	iamme	npope-laptop	i dont think so, i just freshly installed the system about 2 hrs ago and havent put any upgrades on it
