2012-02-05T21:20:00.000Z	florian		does the ubuntu network card go to sleep when it is not in use?
2012-02-05T21:21:00.000Z	Dweezahr	florian	depends on settings in the OS
2012-02-05T21:21:00.000Z	Dweezahr	florian	does ubuntu sell nics nowadays?
2012-02-05T21:22:00.000Z	florian	Dweezahr	:) it is a "Atheros Communications AR8121/AR8113/AR8114 Gigabit or Fast Ethernet"
2012-02-05T21:24:00.000Z	Dweezahr	florian	have you ever noticed it went to sleep?
2012-02-05T21:24:00.000Z	florian	Dweezahr	my skype crashes after some time. Or it is not really crashing, nothing is happening anymore. I can't send messages etc. But if I have a radio stream running, while using skype everything is fine
2012-02-05T21:25:00.000Z	Dweezahr	florian	try to use a browser when skype is crashing, it would not make sense, likely there is something wrong with keepalive connections
2012-02-05T21:26:00.000Z	florian	Dweezahr	a browser? like firefox? what should i do?
2012-02-05T21:27:00.000Z	Dweezahr	florian	when things crash see if firefox is still able to load a webpage, so check that not everything related to internet is down, then you can rule out that the couse is the network card
2012-02-05T21:28:00.000Z	Dweezahr	florian	ssh did not even got to that part right? if it cannot connect
2012-02-05T21:28:00.000Z	florian	Dweezahr	firefox works fine. some weeks ago i didn't noticed the problem at all. Because skype shows it is running.
2012-02-05T21:29:00.000Z	florian	Dweezahr	and I can kill skype and restart it, and it is good again for few minutes without a radio stream
2012-02-05T21:29:00.000Z	Dweezahr	florian	that makes it hard to diagnose the problem, but I dont think it is the network card, would be very strange
2012-02-05T21:30:00.000Z	florian	Dweezahr	i think the problem is very strange. If i start skype with the console, nothing is logged there. no error or warning. I just can't send messages or change my status.
2012-02-05T21:31:00.000Z	florian	Dweezahr	and the only workaround I found is starting a radio stream

2012-02-05T21:34:00.000Z	florian	Dweezahr	thx, will try it there
2012-02-05T21:55:00.000Z	Dweezahr	florian	I had problem with pulseaudio as well
2012-02-05T21:55:00.000Z	Dweezahr	florian	alsa is the alternative I see now
2012-02-05T21:58:00.000Z	Dweezahr	florian	I would say that is fair then
