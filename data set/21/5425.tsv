2007-10-18T15:03:00.000Z	flick		hi, i have a pc with Windows XP, but since i do not want to upgrade to Vista i decided to install Ubuntu and give it a try
2007-10-18T15:04:00.000Z	flick		i've heard a lot about Ubuntu... could anyone please help me with a location on how to install it?
2007-10-18T15:04:00.000Z	flick		haha
2007-10-18T15:04:00.000Z	flick		because i don't want to do away with Xp right away... as i can play games there
2007-10-18T15:05:00.000Z	flick		ok thanks
2007-10-18T15:05:00.000Z	flick		oh cool
2007-10-18T15:05:00.000Z	flick		i guess i chose the right time then! i will wait for a few hours :)
2007-10-18T15:05:00.000Z	flick		meanwhile i will read up the documents you gave me... thanks
2007-10-18T15:07:00.000Z	flick		:)
2007-10-18T15:07:00.000Z	livingdaylight	flick	xp is an excellent excelletn os
2007-10-18T15:08:00.000Z	flick	livingdaylight	i concur... excellent but it is getting old, so i thought why not try the new ones that are admired by people :)
2007-10-18T15:09:00.000Z	livingdaylight	flick	i like your thinking...
2007-10-18T15:10:00.000Z	livingdaylight	flick	its also worth considering an os not just from  a personal (egotistical perspective if you like, for want of a better term) and also from wider social and philosophical point of view...
2007-10-18T15:11:00.000Z	livingdaylight	flick	xp is a great os and Ubuntu is not half bad either... but xp is not open-source or supports open source fundamentals which ubuntu does
2007-10-18T15:12:00.000Z	flick	livingdaylight	i suppose ubuntu will be as good as xp, may also be like what vista should have been
2007-10-18T15:13:00.000Z	livingdaylight	flick	what do you mean by good? in many respects Ubuntu is already much better than any windows os has ever been
2007-10-18T15:14:00.000Z	flick	livingdaylight	i meant no disrespect, i am sure it is better in certain respects
2007-10-18T15:15:00.000Z	livingdaylight	flick	mc44 forbids me to speak any more on this topic here
2007-10-18T15:15:00.000Z	flick	livingdaylight	yeah i'll not thanks i will read the docs now to get myself familiar with Ubuntu better till the new version comes out
2007-10-18T15:16:00.000Z	livingdaylight	flick	no entiendo?
2007-10-18T15:17:00.000Z	livingdaylight	flick	new version is out today
