2012-09-06T17:22:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499		Is there a more stable 64 bit kernel I can use in ubuntu?
2012-09-06T17:23:00.000Z	ThinkT510	ShapeShifter499	more stable? what problems are you having?
2012-09-06T17:24:00.000Z	ThinkT510	ShapeShifter499	only 3.2 is supported
2012-09-06T17:27:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ThinkT510	Ok I can downgrade to the supported kernel however if I try to use the system it locks up
2012-09-06T17:27:00.000Z	ThinkT510	ShapeShifter499	what hardware do you have?
2012-09-06T17:28:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ThinkT510	And when I mean use, I mean put considerable load, light use seems ok
2012-09-06T17:28:00.000Z	ThinkT510	ShapeShifter499	what are you doing on it when you put it under load?
2012-09-06T17:29:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ThinkT510	I have a Acer Aspire 7540-1284 AMD Athlon X2, ATI Radeon HD4200

2012-09-06T17:31:00.000Z	ThinkT510	ShapeShifter499	when you say locks up do you mean it freezes and becomes completely non-responsive?
2012-09-06T17:34:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ThinkT510	Yes
2012-09-06T17:35:00.000Z	ThinkT510	ShapeShifter499	are you using fglrx or the open source radeon driver?
2012-09-06T17:37:00.000Z	ThinkT510	ShapeShifter499	do you have any ppas installed?
2012-09-06T17:38:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ThinkT510	ppas?

2012-10-28T18:27:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ThinkT510	I know but I was wondering if anyone happened to know about a ".resequence" file
