2005-04-20T08:56:00.000Z	sighnal		 For Hoary, you will need to add the MARILLAT and MULTIVERSE repositories.
2005-04-20T08:56:00.000Z	sighnal		hm. where?
2005-04-20T08:56:00.000Z	whiskers	sighnal	don't add marillat if you are in the US
2005-04-20T08:57:00.000Z	sighnal	whiskers	switzerland here. ;)
2005-04-20T08:57:00.000Z	whiskers	sighnal	oh..i don't know what your laws are like
2005-04-20T08:57:00.000Z	sighnal	whiskers	where can i find the urls for that?
2005-04-20T08:58:00.000Z	whiskers	sighnal	marillat has their own website
2005-04-20T08:58:00.000Z	whiskers	sighnal	you can just go there and download the files with firefox
2005-04-20T08:58:00.000Z	whiskers	sighnal	but it is not for people in the US
2005-04-20T09:05:00.000Z	whiskers	sighnal	but this url is not for people in the US
2005-04-20T09:05:00.000Z	sighnal	whiskers	i'm not from the USA ;)
2005-04-20T09:07:00.000Z	whiskers	sighnal	if you go to that url..then proceed for the file you want...it is called a binary of libcss or something like that
2005-04-20T09:07:00.000Z	sighnal	whiskers	yes. but i think i cant use linux on my workstation. no support for videodriver, sound, lan.. ;)
2005-04-20T09:08:00.000Z	whiskers	sighnal	hmmm....ok you must have strange hardware
2005-04-21T11:51:00.000Z	whiskers	sighnal	that is the problem known as dependency hell....about all you can do is to go compile the apps with your newest libraries and hope they work
2005-04-21T11:51:00.000Z	sighnal	whiskers	ok. totem dont play my divx movies. (and i installed w32codecs)
2005-04-21T11:52:00.000Z	whiskers	sighnal	you don't need w32codecs for divx....you need the highly compressive mpeg-4...divx codec
2005-04-21T11:53:00.000Z	whiskers	sighnal	but i stay out of this kind of stuff
2005-04-21T11:53:00.000Z	sighnal	whiskers	and where can i find it? ;)
2005-04-21T11:54:00.000Z	whiskers	sighnal	well i hear there is a free version at www.divx.com
2005-04-21T11:54:00.000Z	whiskers	sighnal	but i don't get into that
