2012-10-29T02:32:00.000Z	gavin__		hello
2012-10-29T02:33:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	gavin__	You will have to give some details for help.
2012-10-29T02:34:00.000Z	gavin__	wilee-nilee	bthere is a black screen with an _ flashing
2012-10-29T02:34:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	gavin__	This on the live cd after choosing to try it out?
2012-10-29T02:34:00.000Z	gavin__	wilee-nilee	its not going anywhere, other than the black screen
2012-10-29T02:35:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	gavin__	So if you boot the live cd you get nothing but a black screen with a blinking cursor?
2012-10-29T02:35:00.000Z	gavin__	wilee-nilee	yes, that is what I'm saying
2012-10-29T02:35:00.000Z	gavin__	wilee-nilee	it is also a 12.10 version that I'm trying to install
2012-10-29T02:36:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	gavin__	I would do a md5sum on the disc, and ISO, you should be getting a gui with choices, also make sure the cd is burned as an image at a slow speed.
2012-10-29T02:38:00.000Z	gavin__	wilee-nilee	I don't understand what I should do?
2012-10-29T02:39:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	gavin__	Follow the link to do a md5sum check, this makes sure the cd matches a hash file and is basically correct. I suggested several things so it helps if you name what you don't understand. ;)
2012-10-29T02:45:00.000Z	gavin__	wilee-nilee	I don't know how to get to the md5sum?
2012-10-29T02:47:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	gavin__	Check out this wiki. http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM Here is the hash comparison page, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes
2012-10-29T02:49:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	gavin__	The problem here is that we have to start somewhere to find the problem, it could be hardware, it could be a number of different issues.
2012-10-29T02:53:00.000Z	gavin__	wilee-nilee	I used windows to download
2012-10-29T02:54:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	gavin__	That link tells you how to check the sum in windows.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM#MD5SUM_on_Windows
2012-10-29T02:56:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	gavin__	Did you burn the cd as an image at a slow speed, you might just need to burn it again if you have extra cd's or use a usb loader like unetbootin if you have a usb.
2012-10-29T02:57:00.000Z	gavin__	wilee-nilee	yes I burned the cd using 3x that is the slowest speed the software has
2012-10-29T02:59:00.000Z	gavin__	wilee-nilee	3x is the slowest speed
2012-10-29T03:00:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	gavin__	I understand, all I can do is make some suggestions, not perform miracles. ;)
