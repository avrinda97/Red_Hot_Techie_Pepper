2007-09-29T08:12:00.000Z	Lifeisfunny		that "help" entry on the ubuntu feisty starter guide for firestarter is bogus
2007-09-29T08:12:00.000Z	Pelo	Lifeisfunny	most of the firestarter stuff if a bit on the thin side
2007-09-29T08:13:00.000Z	Pelo	Lifeisfunny	 do you have a good reason to use a firewall in ubuntu or are you just comming from windows ?
2007-09-29T08:14:00.000Z	Pelo	Lifeisfunny	don'T worry about the firewall then, it's not a neccesity in linux,  not like it is in windows
2007-09-29T08:16:00.000Z	Pelo	Lifeisfunny	 man iptables  it is the cli userspace for netfilter wich is the actual firewall,  firestarter is jsut a gui frontend
2007-09-29T08:17:00.000Z	Pelo	Lifeisfunny	don'T give out your user password and don'T run as root and you'll be fine
2007-09-29T08:19:00.000Z	Pelo	Lifeisfunny	is this a home computer or a business one ?
2007-09-29T08:19:00.000Z	Lifeisfunny	Pelo	home
2007-09-29T08:19:00.000Z	Pelo	Lifeisfunny	 personnaly I don'T worry about it ,
2007-09-29T08:21:00.000Z	Pelo	Lifeisfunny	I'm a home user with one comp, directly connected to a dsl modem no router, and I don'T use the firewall , and I don'T worry,  I worried in windows quite a bit
2008-04-05T02:25:00.000Z	Pelo	Lifeisfunny	unlikely
2008-08-14T06:03:00.000Z	Pelo	Lifeisfunny	 terminal ,  sudo rm  /path/filename
2008-08-14T06:03:00.000Z	Lifeisfunny	Pelo	doesn't rm delete it?
2008-08-14T06:04:00.000Z	Pelo	Lifeisfunny	I thought you wanted to get rid of the file,  sorry then,  just permission ?   sudo chmod 755 /path/filename
2008-08-14T06:06:00.000Z	Lifeisfunny	Pelo	the lock remains  and now it seems I've added an X to the scenario
2008-08-14T06:06:00.000Z	Pelo	Lifeisfunny	very odd,   are you using your admin username and passw ?
2008-08-14T06:07:00.000Z	Pelo	Lifeisfunny	not what I mean ,  how many accounts do you have ?

2008-08-14T06:09:00.000Z	Pelo	Lifeisfunny	ok try this   sudo chown username:username /path/filename && sudo chmod 775 /path/filename
