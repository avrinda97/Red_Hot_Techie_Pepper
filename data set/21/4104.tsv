2008-07-25T19:26:00.000Z	minimec	gaelfx	Does this happen all the time and what kind of cpu do you have?
2008-07-25T19:30:00.000Z	gaelfx	minimec	sorry, was trolling the net, yes, it happens with pretty high freq AMD64 proc
2008-07-25T19:31:00.000Z	minimec	gaelfx	OK. And cpu goes up to 100%?
2008-07-25T19:33:00.000Z	minimec	gaelfx	Are you running the 64bit version of Ubuntu?
2008-07-25T19:38:00.000Z	gaelfx	minimec	yes I am running the 64bit version
2008-07-25T19:40:00.000Z	minimec	gaelfx	I can't help you, as I am running 32bit with an AMD64 x2 5000+ with nvidia7600. Have no problem with that.
2012-04-30T17:12:00.000Z	minimec	gaelfx	I cannot confirm your problem. Two finger scrolling is working for me in nautilus. Maybe you find something in the nautilus settings. Otherwise try to remove/rename the .config/nautilus folder once .
2012-04-30T17:13:00.000Z	gaelfx	minimec	it was working, but it just suddenly stopped, I'll try killing it and restarting
2012-04-30T17:15:00.000Z	gaelfx	minimec	ok, I was wrong, it's not working in most things, just Skype and Chrome it seems to work (weird eh?)
2012-04-30T17:18:00.000Z	minimec	gaelfx	What are the mouse/touchpad settings in the ubuntu settings. Could you check if at least the 'edge scrolling' setting is working?
2012-04-30T17:18:00.000Z	gaelfx	minimec	will do
2012-04-30T17:20:00.000Z	gaelfx	minimec	edge-scrolling works on nothing, not even chrome or skype
2012-04-30T17:21:00.000Z	gaelfx	minimec	scratch that, it works on chrome and skype, but not others
2012-04-30T17:22:00.000Z	minimec	gaelfx	ok. I don't know if I can really help you. You would have to figure out what kind of touchpad you are using and what driver. All I can say is, that synaptics based touchpads are working well, atleast on two machines I configured for 12.04.
2012-04-30T17:23:00.000Z	gaelfx	minimec	I think I probably just ought to give up and restart, see if that gets it
2012-04-30T17:29:00.000Z	gaelfx	minimec	restart solved the issue. still wish I knew what exactly caused it though, do you know what I could look for in the logs? just synaptics?
2012-04-30T17:30:00.000Z	minimec	gaelfx	Don't know really, as the touchpad is handled by the xserver. It would probably be some X error.
2012-04-30T17:31:00.000Z	gaelfx	minimec	yikes, that probably won't be so easy to find
2012-04-30T17:31:00.000Z	minimec	gaelfx	Exactly...
2012-04-30T17:36:00.000Z	minimec	gaelfx	dmesg |grep syna <-- check if you have a synaptics based touchpad
2012-04-30T17:37:00.000Z	gaelfx	minimec	already tried, it just showed when it loaded the driver
