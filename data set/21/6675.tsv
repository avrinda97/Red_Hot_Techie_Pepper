2007-02-24T06:52:00.000Z	colbert		Can someone please help me to access my XP partition in Ubuntu??
2007-02-24T06:52:00.000Z	arrenlex	colbert	read-only, or writing also?
2007-02-24T06:53:00.000Z	colbert	arrenlex	Both would be preferred
2007-02-24T06:53:00.000Z	colbert	arrenlex	thank you
2007-02-24T07:10:00.000Z	colbert	arrenlex	Thank you! I have mounted my XP partition.. silly question time: I have opened the folder and I see it at /media/BGPC XP, now how do I make a shortcut to it on my desktop or make it readily available there??
2007-02-24T07:10:00.000Z	arrenlex	colbert	In terminal: ln -s /media/BGPC\ XP ~/Desktop/music
2007-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	colbert	arrenlex	Wow thanks so much! Is there no way to create a shortcut without terminal ??
2007-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	arrenlex	colbert	Probably, but I don't know it since I don't use gnome.
2007-02-24T07:13:00.000Z	colbert	arrenlex	Okay, thank you!
2007-02-24T07:23:00.000Z	colbert	arrenlex	Little problem here, when I followed that command to create the shortcut "ln -s /media/BGPC\ XP ~/Desktop/music" I failed to put the \ between BGPC and XP for the space, and it created bad "BGPC" and "XP links on the desktop, I deleted BGPC but I can't seem to get rid of XP ?
2007-02-24T07:23:00.000Z	arrenlex	colbert	You've come to the right place! This channel is all about helping you get rid of XP :D
2007-02-24T07:24:00.000Z	arrenlex	colbert	For future reference, Linux doesn't like spaces in filenames. I highly advise you not to use them for files you will be accessing in the command line, because it's a pain to escape them with \ every time.
2007-02-24T07:24:00.000Z	colbert	arrenlex	Okay
2007-02-24T07:24:00.000Z	arrenlex	colbert	What happens if you just press delete over XP?
2007-02-24T07:24:00.000Z	colbert	arrenlex	Nothing
2007-02-24T07:25:00.000Z	colbert	arrenlex	The icon has a locked emblem on it
2007-02-24T07:25:00.000Z	arrenlex	colbert	Okay, open up the terminal and type "cd ~/Desktop". Then type "rm XP".
2007-02-24T07:25:00.000Z	colbert	arrenlex	You strike again :) Thank you :)
2007-02-24T07:26:00.000Z	arrenlex	colbert	Is it actually gone?
2007-02-24T07:26:00.000Z	colbert	arrenlex	Yes
2007-03-07T06:50:00.000Z	colbert	arrenlex	I get the same error with gksudo :(
