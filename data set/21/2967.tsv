2009-05-04T00:36:00.000Z	skapism		Hello, I've been following the Karmic-changes mailing list archive, and I wonder, why have the accepted packages not yet appeared on the repositories?
2009-05-04T00:37:00.000Z	skapism		do the new repositories need a while before they get the new packages?
2009-05-04T00:37:00.000Z	lstarnes	skapism	which new packages?
2009-05-04T00:37:00.000Z	skapism	lstarnes	linux 2.6.30-1.1, for example
2009-05-04T00:37:00.000Z	skapism	lstarnes	karmic still have the jaunty version
2009-05-04T00:38:00.000Z	lstarnes	skapism	try asking in #ubuntu+1
2009-05-04T00:38:00.000Z	lstarnes	skapism	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2009-05-04T00:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	skapism	and are you using jaunty's repos?
2009-05-04T00:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	skapism	just stick with the jaunty repos
2009-05-04T00:39:00.000Z	skapism	lstarnes	nah, I can afford to trash this installation :)
2009-05-04T00:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	skapism	karmic has only been around for a couple weeks and it is still well below an alpha
2009-05-04T00:40:00.000Z	skapism	lstarnes	've got it backed up neatly
2009-05-04T00:40:00.000Z	skapism	lstarnes	yes, I know. but I'd like a > .29 kernel for kms etc
2009-05-04T00:41:00.000Z	lstarnes	skapism	you could compile your own kernel but that isn't supported
2009-05-04T00:41:00.000Z	skapism	lstarnes	yeah, I'll just wait for .30 to show up in karmic and then update the repos
2009-05-04T00:41:00.000Z	lstarnes	skapism	do not use karmic repos on jaunty
2009-05-04T00:42:00.000Z	skapism	lstarnes	I'd switch over completely or wait for the alpha
2009-05-04T00:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	skapism	I'd personally wait for the release or the beta
2009-05-04T00:42:00.000Z	skapism	lstarnes	my question was more of the sort: why do messages that appear on the karmic-changes list do not appear on packages.ubuntu.com
2009-05-04T00:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	skapism	someone in #ubuntu+1 might know
2009-05-04T00:42:00.000Z	skapism	lstarnes	I've been on jaunty since day one, it never broke for me, so that's ok
