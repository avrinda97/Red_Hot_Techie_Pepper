2011-10-27T16:58:00.000Z	obert-		mm i cannot halt the system: it'll remains in the terminal window without shutdown all
2011-10-27T16:59:00.000Z	obert-		unmount: /run/lock not unmounted   *Will now halt -- System halted.  but then no shutdown happens
2011-10-27T17:00:00.000Z	obert-		seems that killall is gone bad (?)
2011-10-27T17:00:00.000Z	Snowie	obert-	i believe HALT and SHUTDOWN are 2 very different states. google that perhaps
2011-10-27T17:01:00.000Z	obert-	Snowie	i dunno how to explain :) i made sudo halt in the shell, and the machine is not shutdowning
2011-10-27T17:02:00.000Z	Snowie	obert-	sudo shutdown now
2011-10-27T17:02:00.000Z	obert-	Snowie	no i cannot type in this window
2011-10-27T17:03:00.000Z	obert-	Snowie	it is the window that appears when you halted the system:) the list of things that are killed correctly or failed
2011-10-27T17:03:00.000Z	obert-		sorry eh
2011-10-27T17:03:00.000Z	Snowie	obert-	what are you typing to make that happen?
2011-10-27T17:04:00.000Z	obert-	Snowie	nothing. i'd typed during the session sudo halt and then waiting that the system will be shutdowned.
2011-10-27T17:05:00.000Z	Snowie	obert-	sudo halt and sudo shutdown are different
2011-10-27T17:05:00.000Z	Snowie		let me try this
2011-10-27T17:05:00.000Z	Snowie		!halt
2011-10-27T17:05:00.000Z	Snowie		!shutdown
2011-10-27T17:05:00.000Z	Snowie		! hatl
2011-10-27T17:05:00.000Z	obert-	Snowie	i always used halt to shutdown the pc
2011-10-27T17:06:00.000Z	obert-	Snowie	'stop the machine, halt'
2011-10-27T17:06:00.000Z	Snowie	obert-	fair enough, then im not sure.
2011-10-27T17:06:00.000Z	obert-		hehe
2011-10-27T17:06:00.000Z	obert-	Snowie	thanks the same:)
