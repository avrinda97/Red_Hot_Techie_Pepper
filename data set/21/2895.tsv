2009-05-20T12:47:00.000Z	sidh		greetings everybody
2009-05-20T12:48:00.000Z	sidh		do you know when installing ubuntu if it is possible to leave the MBR untouched by the install process
2009-05-20T12:48:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	sidh	probably, but you wouldn't be able to boot into it?
2009-05-20T12:48:00.000Z	sidh	Robbie_Crash	i use GAG for the MBR
2009-05-20T12:49:00.000Z	sidh	Robbie_Crash	i want ubuntu's grub to install on the root partition
2009-05-20T12:49:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	sidh	I'm pretty sure there's an option in either standard or advanced install to not install a boot loader
2009-05-20T12:50:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	sidh	as in /grub? or just on the same logical partition?
2009-05-20T12:51:00.000Z	sidh	Robbie_Crash	i mean on the /boot partition
2009-05-20T12:52:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	sidh	then when setting it up in the installer, don't specify a different partition for /boot
2009-05-20T12:52:00.000Z	sidh	Robbie_Crash	i want grub to choose the kernel I boot, but i don't want it install on the MBR, i really don't want that
2009-05-20T12:53:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	sidh	so you want to have your normal boot loader, with an option in it to boot to grub, and then have grub load for partition choosing?
2009-05-20T12:53:00.000Z	sidh	Robbie_Crash	i install a four booting systems
2009-05-20T12:55:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	sidh	ok. I get it.
2009-05-20T12:56:00.000Z	sidh	Robbie_Crash	GAG is for me the most proper way to have a loader on the MBR
2009-05-20T12:57:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	sidh	there's probably a way to do it. But I don't know how. Sorry.
2009-05-20T12:59:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	sidh	in the ubuntu forums there's a post that says that the alternate install cd gives you the option of where to install grub, but the normal install cd by default installs to mbr
2009-05-20T13:01:00.000Z	sidh	Robbie_Crash	do you have access to your ubuntu box
2009-05-20T13:01:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	sidh	nope. I've got access to two Windows boxes, and the router. But the Ubuntu box I need to get online is inaccessible.
2009-05-20T13:02:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	sidh	the box is using 192.168.1.1 as its gateway, but the router is 192.168.2.1 now.
2009-05-20T13:22:00.000Z	sidh	Robbie_Crash	no but you can tell it to reboot in 10 minutes
2009-05-20T13:22:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	sidh	yeah, I need to get my router to shut down for a few minutes, so that my linux box tries to renew its IP
