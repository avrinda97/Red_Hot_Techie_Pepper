2005-06-25T13:12:00.000Z	tmdca		hi. i have reconfigured my xserver so i should be able to have higher than 800x600 at 70hz but the changes dont work, they are gone when i restart xserver....i can use 1042x768 but only at 60hz... help!
2005-06-25T13:12:00.000Z	reka	tmdca	what monitor do you have?
2005-06-25T13:14:00.000Z	tmdca	reka	a compaq, quite old thing. i hade 1024 at 70hz before at debian...
2005-06-25T13:14:00.000Z	reka	tmdca	so the res is fine, it's just the refresh rate?
2005-06-25T13:15:00.000Z	tmdca	reka	Yes.
2005-06-25T13:16:00.000Z	reka	tmdca	martin: you both probably don't have your monitor refresh rates set correctly in xorg.conf
2005-06-25T13:18:00.000Z	tmdca	reka	where in that file should i edit?
2005-06-25T13:18:00.000Z	reka	tmdca	the relevant section can be found on the link i posted
2005-06-25T13:24:00.000Z	tmdca	reka	I have read the guide, but there is nothing wrong with my xorg.conf
2005-06-25T13:26:00.000Z	reka	tmdca	post your xorg.conf file to ubuntu.pastebin.com please
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z	tmdca	reka	i have post it now.....
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z	reka	tmdca	link?
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z	tmdca	reka	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/301509
2005-06-25T13:31:00.000Z	reka	tmdca	seems  kind of low
2005-06-25T13:31:00.000Z	tmdca	reka	i know. its an ooold screen.....
2005-06-25T13:33:00.000Z	reka	tmdca	well like i said before, it's best to use the rates out there i.e. google your model and "horizsync" or try hs: 30-96 and vs 50 - 160

2005-06-27T14:08:00.000Z	reka	tmdca	if you're having sound problems, it's more likely the output plugin
2005-06-27T14:09:00.000Z	tmdca	reka	no i dont. xmms just wont play mp3files
2005-06-27T14:09:00.000Z	reka	tmdca	i repeat, if you're having sound problems, it's more likely the output plugin.  have you changed it to esd or alsa?
2005-06-27T14:10:00.000Z	tmdca	reka	alsa...
