2009-04-25T21:19:00.000Z	daftykins		can you pastebin /etc/X11/xorg.conf please Swistak
2009-04-25T21:20:00.000Z	daftykins		what version ubuntu/xubuntu/etc again please Swistak ?
2009-04-25T21:20:00.000Z	dooner	daftykins	you sure no reboot needed?  I thought anytime I mucked with xinerma settings it wanted to reboot (at least restart X)
2009-04-25T21:21:00.000Z	daftykins	dooner	you're maybe right but apply button usually sets immediate for me. i'll try one thing then give in
2009-04-25T21:21:00.000Z	daftykins		can you make a backup of xorg.conf with terminal please Swistak ?
2009-04-25T21:21:00.000Z	dooner	daftykins	Twinview I think does that but once you have xinerma set it needs to restart x to unload it.
2009-04-25T21:22:00.000Z	daftykins		oh ok dooner thanks i did not know that
2009-04-25T21:24:00.000Z	daftykins		the more i read the xorg.conf the more i agreed with you dooner :D thanks for saying. reboot first then we'll see
2009-04-25T21:25:00.000Z	daftykins	dooner	 i was thinking force "Composite" item, do you remember if it is "extension" section or "module" ?
