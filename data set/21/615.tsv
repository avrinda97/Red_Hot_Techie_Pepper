2011-08-29T18:09:00.000Z	silverarrow_		how do you check if you port is being forwarded in transmission ?
2011-08-29T18:10:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow_	you go to edit->preferences and the network tab should have a "Check Port" button
2011-08-29T18:10:00.000Z	silverarrow_	gaelfx	so, really simple?
2011-08-29T18:10:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow_	it doesn't seem to work properly unless you actually have an active torrent going though
2011-08-29T18:10:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow_	generally, yeah
2011-08-29T18:11:00.000Z	silverarrow_	gaelfx	I have had weird issues with slow seeding and downloading
2011-08-29T18:13:00.000Z	silverarrow_	gaelfx	port is closed ?
2011-08-29T18:15:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow_	it sounds like you haven't forwarded the port, do you have access to the router you're connected to?
2011-08-29T18:15:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow_	also, is uPnP enabled in the Transmission preferences?
2011-08-29T18:15:00.000Z	silverarrow_	gaelfx	well when my neighbor comes home, we are sharing internet
2011-08-29T18:16:00.000Z	silverarrow_	gaelfx	upnp?
2011-08-29T18:16:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow_	it's a way for Transmission to automatically ask the router to forward the port
2011-08-29T18:17:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow_	however, if you're just using the modem provided by your ISP, you probably won't be able to forward the ports and whatnot
2011-08-29T18:17:00.000Z	silverarrow_	gaelfx	I shall look for it
2011-08-29T18:19:00.000Z	silverarrow_	gaelfx	yes upnp it's marked off for
2011-08-29T18:19:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow_	does that mean it's on or it's off?
2011-08-29T18:21:00.000Z	silverarrow_	gaelfx	there is an option "pick a random port everytime transmision is started"
2011-08-29T18:21:00.000Z	silverarrow_	gaelfx	it would be tricky to open a port?
2011-08-29T18:22:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow_	if you have upnp, you shouldn't have to do anything to open the port, however, if you don't, it's a little bit tiresome changing it, yes
2011-08-29T18:23:00.000Z	silverarrow_	gaelfx	I hope upnp will work then
2011-08-29T18:24:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow_	like I said, if you have your own router, it shouldn't be a problem, it's the ISP provided modems that are generally a pita
