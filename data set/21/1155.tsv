2011-02-04T14:09:00.000Z	sl33k_		The update manager before beginning to update shows low memory. Why is it such? (I am on dual booted 10.04 LTS)
2011-02-04T14:11:00.000Z	bc81	sl33k_	what is the exact error message? need more details
2011-02-04T14:13:00.000Z	sl33k_	bc81	After clicking install updates, window pops up showing "not enough disk space" "empty some disk space"
2011-02-04T14:14:00.000Z	bc81	sl33k_	pastebin the output of       df -h

2011-02-04T14:16:00.000Z	bc81	sl33k_	you have ~90MB available it seems...you need to free up space, or expand your partition
2011-02-04T14:18:00.000Z	sl33k_	bc81	how difficult is it to expand the partition?
2011-02-04T14:19:00.000Z	bc81	sl33k_	well, i would boot into a live cd, and use gparted to expand the partition...depending on how many partitions/operating systems you have, it can be very easy to quite time consuming
2011-02-04T14:21:00.000Z	sl33k_	bc81	i have a live cd of 9.x. my other partition is xp via wubi.
2011-02-04T14:22:00.000Z	bc81	sl33k_	then you can probably shrink the xp partition (defrag first) and expand the ubuntu partition
2011-02-04T14:26:00.000Z	bc81	sl33k_	Jordan_U the gparted documentation recommends it http://gparted.sourceforge.net/display-doc.php?name=help-manual&lang=C#gparted-advanced-partition-actions  besides, it won't hurt any to do so
2011-02-04T14:36:00.000Z	sl33k_	bc81	for how long can i go without updating ubuntu?
2011-02-04T14:37:00.000Z	bc81	sl33k_	lol some people run very old systems and never update...depends on how comfortable you are with potential security holes
2011-02-04T14:40:00.000Z	bc81	sl33k_	example, if you have a "work horse" machine that maybe only encodes video 24/7 or renders 3d sequences, never has a need to connect to the net..you can run this system indefinitely without updating
2011-02-04T14:42:00.000Z	sl33k_	bc81	so its ok if i delay this a bit
2011-02-04T14:47:00.000Z	bc81	sl33k_	bleachbit for linux, ccleaner for windows
2011-02-04T14:48:00.000Z	sl33k_	bc81	apt-get install bleachbit?
2011-02-04T14:49:00.000Z	sl33k_	bc81	will it give problems when installing modules to other partitions?
2011-02-04T14:49:00.000Z	bc81	sl33k_	yes, but you only have about 6 gig for your entire linux installation.  please consider shrinking windows, and expanding linux partition by 20 or more GB
2011-02-04T14:49:00.000Z	bc81	sl33k_	i don't know..what do you mean by modlues?
2011-02-04T14:50:00.000Z	sl33k_	bc81	like checking out from a repository.
