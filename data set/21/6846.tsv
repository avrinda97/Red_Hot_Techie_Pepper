2010-05-23T20:58:00.000Z	jud	unop	that's what i wanted to do. what would man in front do?
2010-05-23T20:59:00.000Z	unop	jud	onetinsoldier was referring you to the manual for sed with 'man sed'
2010-05-23T21:02:00.000Z	jud	unop	thanks...on that learning curve. the reason i needed to do that was to change list details so that yahoo would recognise their format in the address field but when i put the newly formed ones in, it triggered the spam filter for some reason. the yahoo limit is 100 right, and it was less than that. you have any ideas why?
2010-05-23T21:03:00.000Z	unop	jud	I'm not sure what to make of that -- are you talking about yahoo mail and the number of address you can place in the "To", "CC" and "BCC" fields?
2010-05-23T21:04:00.000Z	jud	unop	 yeah, between the fields, there was less than 100 total so...?
2010-05-23T21:06:00.000Z	unop	jud	i'm not sure what the limit is - i've not used yahoo mail in ages.  My guess is that your sed hasn't worked - I.e. in effect, the sed command has only placed a comma at the end-of-line and not actually taken the newlines out
2010-05-23T21:07:00.000Z	jud	unop	they were all still on seperate lines. but not seperated by one. is that what you mean?
2010-05-23T21:08:00.000Z	unop	jud	well, that was a guess - the problem could be elsewhere.   what does this command give you on the file?    wc -l /path/to/file
2010-05-23T21:10:00.000Z	jud	unop	so if i'm in the directory already, id just go wc-l/to/file ?
2010-05-23T21:11:00.000Z	unop	jud	 wc -l file   # note the spaces
2010-05-23T21:14:00.000Z	jud	unop	it tells me the number of emails right? i'm not a spamer. i'm trying to get a message out to people making submissions to a newsletter asap
2010-05-23T21:15:00.000Z	jud	unop	what email do you use?
2010-05-23T21:17:00.000Z	unop	jud	well, that tells you how many entries are in the file - counted by line
2010-05-23T21:17:00.000Z	unop	jud	I use gmail
2010-05-23T21:18:00.000Z	jud	unop	yeah, it's the same as the number of emails
2010-05-23T21:18:00.000Z	jud	unop	one per line, with a comma at the end
2010-05-23T21:19:00.000Z	unop	jud	try using all emails on one line instead?    tr -d '\n' < file > newfile
2010-05-23T21:22:00.000Z	jud	unop	they should have a space after the comma to shouldn't they?
2010-05-23T21:22:00.000Z	unop	jud	not necessarily, but yea, good idea
2010-05-23T21:29:00.000Z	jud	unop	 well, thanks. i'll see how i go later
