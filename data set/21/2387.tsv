2009-11-23T14:08:00.000Z	knoppies		Is there a way to filter by name when using the ls command? so ls "*.conf" or ls "conky*"
2009-11-23T14:09:00.000Z	mattcen	knoppies	Can you be more specific? What you've suggested as examples will filter out just the matches you'd expect..
2009-11-23T14:09:00.000Z	mattcen	knoppies	for everything else there's usually grep :P
2009-11-23T14:10:00.000Z	knoppies	mattcen	I mean, to only display results that match whats inside the "" the * being a wildcard
2009-11-23T14:10:00.000Z	knoppies	mattcen	never heared of grep, let me have a look at it
2009-11-23T14:11:00.000Z	mattcen	knoppies	Yes you should be able to use * as a wildcard with no issues
2009-11-23T14:11:00.000Z	knoppies	mattcen	but whats the option to filter? Ive read both help and manpage but found nothing.
2009-11-23T14:11:00.000Z	mattcen	knoppies	Ah I see your issue
2009-11-23T14:11:00.000Z	mattcen	knoppies	Don't use the quotes you've got there; they're squashing the * in a wildcard
2009-11-23T14:12:00.000Z	mattcen	knoppies	It's causing the * to be interepreted as a literal
2009-11-23T14:12:00.000Z	mattcen	knoppies	howso?
2009-11-23T14:13:00.000Z	knoppies	mattcen	say I got 10 docs in a folder. And 4 of them end in *.txt
2009-11-23T14:13:00.000Z	knoppies	mattcen	Billiard yes
2009-11-23T14:14:00.000Z	mattcen	knoppies	How about you PM me the output you're getting? It's quite hard to interpret what you mean
2009-11-23T14:15:00.000Z	knoppies	mattcen	Billiard: ls:cannot access ./conky*: No such file or directory
2009-11-23T14:18:00.000Z	knoppies	mattcen	Billiard, llutz: didnt work, same output: No such file or directory. Thanks, I gtg, I will look into this again another time.
2009-11-23T14:20:00.000Z	mattcen	knoppies	To show a 'list' output (see the manpage).
2009-11-23T14:20:00.000Z	knoppies	mattcen	llutz Billiard janisozaur Thank you guys.
2009-11-23T14:20:00.000Z	mattcen	knoppies	I'm intrigued about your problem. You are looking for conky*, right?
2009-11-23T14:21:00.000Z	knoppies	mattcen	I have multiple conky configs in the home directory, all starting with .conkyrc* I forgot to add the . in the front. Thats what my problem was. (and the -a option for hidden files)
2009-11-23T14:21:00.000Z	mattcen	knoppies	Ah right, I see.
