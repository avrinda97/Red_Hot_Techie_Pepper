2005-11-02T15:13:00.000Z	xArv3nx		No one answers or anything. :(
2005-11-02T15:13:00.000Z	xArv3nx		Last time I went there they couldn't figure out the problem anyways. :(
2005-11-02T15:13:00.000Z	xArv3nx		Maybe I should just install Mepis?
2005-11-02T15:13:00.000Z	xArv3nx		:(
2005-11-02T15:13:00.000Z	xArv3nx		I know.
2005-11-02T15:13:00.000Z	xArv3nx		Kubuntu.
2005-11-02T15:14:00.000Z	xArv3nx		I like Kubuntu.
2005-11-02T15:15:00.000Z	xArv3nx		:(
2005-11-02T15:15:00.000Z	xArv3nx		i wubberz kubuntu so much but it freezes SO much.
2005-11-02T15:17:00.000Z	xArv3nx		Can anyone help me? Kubuntu keeps freezing. I went to the Kubuntu channel but they didn't help any. :(
2005-11-02T15:17:00.000Z	jesse_	xArv3nx	whats the problem?
2005-11-02T15:17:00.000Z	jesse_	xArv3nx	on what step? what program?
2005-11-02T15:18:00.000Z	jesse_	xArv3nx	any detail helps
2005-11-02T15:18:00.000Z	jesse_	xArv3nx	is it a hang, or a complete freeze? are you moving files or doing something memory intensive?
2005-11-02T15:19:00.000Z	jesse_	xArv3nx	have you ran any memory/hardware testing apps?
2005-11-02T15:20:00.000Z	jesse_	xArv3nx	there is a memtest option if you go to the grub menu on boot
2005-11-02T15:20:00.000Z	jesse_	xArv3nx	sounds like it could also be video card
2005-11-02T15:21:00.000Z	jesse_	xArv3nx	dont know, since it doesnt happen with a specific set of criteria its hard to diagnose
2005-11-02T15:21:00.000Z	jesse_	xArv3nx	i recommend some hardware testing
2005-11-02T15:21:00.000Z	jesse_	xArv3nx	i would try that maybe, if its not too difficult
2005-11-02T15:21:00.000Z	jesse_	xArv3nx	just be methodical, test one thing at a time
