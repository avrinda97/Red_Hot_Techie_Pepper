2012-05-05T08:49:00.000Z	wylde	whytw0sean	np
2012-05-05T09:21:00.000Z	wylde	whytw0sean	'ubuntu-bug nautilus' will start a bug report.
2012-05-05T09:26:00.000Z	wylde	whytw0sean	nautilus is the default file manager.
2012-05-05T09:31:00.000Z	wylde	whytw0sean	ummm explain that again please?
2012-05-05T09:31:00.000Z	wylde	whytw0sean	props? hit run?
2012-05-05T09:33:00.000Z	wylde	whytw0sean	in properties that's is just setting the execuable bit, that much is correct. You'll have better results launching .sh scripts from the terminal.
2012-05-05T09:34:00.000Z	wylde	whytw0sean	eg 'cd ~/Desktop' './somescript.sh'
2012-05-05T09:34:00.000Z	wylde	whytw0sean	exactly
2012-05-05T09:35:00.000Z	wylde	whytw0sean	also just for future reference. Since you'll be opening a terminal anyway, the command 'chmod +x filename' will set the file as executable
2012-05-05T09:37:00.000Z	wylde	whytw0sean	does the file actually exist?
2012-05-05T09:38:00.000Z	wylde	whytw0sean	you're not putting a space afte the / I hope
2012-05-05T09:39:00.000Z	wylde	whytw0sean	is there anything inside the file? Or are you trying to run empty files as scripts.
2012-05-05T09:41:00.000Z	wylde	whytw0sean	umm yes, a batch file is NOT the same as a bash script.
2012-05-05T09:42:00.000Z	wylde	whytw0sean	batch file commands won't work in linux. Perhaps if you ran them in wine
2012-05-05T09:57:00.000Z	wylde	whytw0sean	then it's not meant for linux.
