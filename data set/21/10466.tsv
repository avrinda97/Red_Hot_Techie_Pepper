2006-04-17T16:26:00.000Z	ompaul	h-bomb	you have quite an obnocious name - mass murder of a doubious legal kind is what it was designed for - now your machine "chown -R username:username  /home/username" is about the best you can hope for
2006-04-17T16:27:00.000Z	ompaul	h-bomb	I find it disrespectful
2006-04-17T16:28:00.000Z	ompaul	h-bomb	and you have been given good advice
2006-04-17T16:35:00.000Z	ompaul	h-bomb	are you logged in as yourself or root?
2006-04-17T16:38:00.000Z	ompaul	h-bomb	there are so few cases that that should not be the case that I would say yes, in general I have never been hurt by owning all the files in my own directory
2006-04-17T16:39:00.000Z	ompaul	h-bomb	usually they are files you get from elsewhere that have permissions on them that don't count anyway
2006-04-17T16:44:00.000Z	ompaul	h-bomb	it has been said to you before, now please put all your thoughts into one line and then press the enter key, and don't be using the enter key as a comma, thanks
2006-04-17T16:47:00.000Z	ompaul	h-bomb	okay so ehh how many other users have you?
2006-04-17T16:48:00.000Z	ompaul	h-bomb	so in the command in their home directorys is >>chown -R username:username *<< in each of their directories
2006-04-17T16:50:00.000Z	ompaul	h-bomb	this was already confirmed for you
2006-04-17T16:53:00.000Z	ompaul	h-bomb	it means every file inthere in fact it should have a full stop in front of it, >>chown -R username:username .*<<
