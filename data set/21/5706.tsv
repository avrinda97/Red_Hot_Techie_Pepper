2007-11-01T14:13:00.000Z	alecwh		It looks too squareish, not like a piece of paper.
2007-11-01T14:13:00.000Z	alecwh		It doesn't look flipped
2007-11-01T14:13:00.000Z	alecwh		transformed.
2007-11-01T14:14:00.000Z	alecwh		not really nbkr...
2007-11-01T14:15:00.000Z	nbkr	alecwh	Pageformat is letter or A4? Then it is flipped. Try printing one page.
2007-11-01T14:09:00.000Z	nbkr	alecwh	Format -> Pagesettings -> Landscape
2007-11-01T14:11:00.000Z	alecwh	nbkr	I don't see pagesetting
2007-11-01T14:11:00.000Z	nbkr	alecwh	Maybe its labeled different in english. I have only the german version here. Its the 5 item from the top in the "Format" menu.
2007-11-01T14:13:00.000Z	alecwh	nbkr	I did that, and it took me to a popup screen. I went to Page, and then Orientation, switched to Landscape. It doesn't seem... right... though.
2007-11-01T14:14:00.000Z	nbkr	alecwh	Try the print preview - it should look more flipped there.
2007-11-01T14:15:00.000Z	alecwh	nbkr	I don't have a printer. It's at my school. :P I'll export to PDF
2007-11-01T14:16:00.000Z	nbkr	alecwh	Being at school at 4 am - thats horrable.
2007-11-01T14:16:00.000Z	alecwh	nbkr	I'm at my home right now. >_>
2007-11-01T14:17:00.000Z	nbkr	alecwh	So the printer is in school. Thats ok then :-)
2007-11-01T14:19:00.000Z	nbkr	alecwh	The described solution ist the correct one.
2007-11-01T14:20:00.000Z	nbkr	alecwh	Can you put the PDF anywhere, so that I can have a look?
2007-11-01T14:21:00.000Z	alecwh	nbkr	yes, one sec.
2007-11-01T14:23:00.000Z	nbkr	alecwh	Well, for most printers is a bit difficult. Most printers in Europe use A4 Paper. Most printers in the USA use Letter-Format I think.
2007-11-01T14:27:00.000Z	alecwh	nbkr	did you get the pdf?
2007-11-01T14:31:00.000Z	nbkr	alecwh	Yes, I did. Gnome says its: 279 x 216 mm - Thats letter format and landscape (also gnome says its portrait), so I would assume that everything is fine.
2007-11-01T14:33:00.000Z	alecwh	nbkr	ok, I'll have to deal with it, I SWEAR it's messed up though. >_>
