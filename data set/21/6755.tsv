2007-03-05T11:24:00.000Z	EdgEy		um, somehow i doubt this problem is related to ubuntu, but my windows-using friends can get this to work fine so..
2007-03-05T11:24:00.000Z	EdgEy		can anyone here using firefox get the search box to accept input? http://armory.wow-europe.com/
2007-03-05T11:24:00.000Z	globe	EdgEy	yes
2007-03-05T11:24:00.000Z	EdgEy		just me then.. argh.
2007-03-05T11:26:00.000Z	globe	EdgEy	you can't type in the search box in firefox?  on a webpage or in the program
2007-03-05T11:26:00.000Z	EdgEy	globe	it's not everywhere, just on that particular site, it's a Flash search bar
2007-03-05T11:26:00.000Z	EdgEy		though it works in windows, i don't think its anything proprietary
2007-03-05T11:27:00.000Z	globe	EdgEy	ooh.  I thought you meant the search bar built into ff
2007-03-05T11:27:00.000Z	EdgEy		hehe, that works fine
2007-03-05T11:28:00.000Z	globe	EdgEy	yea, I cant type in that either.  it may be broken flash
2007-03-05T11:28:00.000Z	EdgEy	globe	thanks for checking
2007-03-05T11:28:00.000Z	globe	EdgEy	the dropdown is broken too....all overlapping and such
2007-03-05T11:28:00.000Z	globe	EdgEy	np
2007-03-05T11:28:00.000Z	EdgEy	globe	yeah, the site itself is rather broken
2007-03-05T11:29:00.000Z	globe	EdgEy	do you run WOW in wine?
2007-03-05T11:29:00.000Z	EdgEy	globe	yes
2007-03-05T11:29:00.000Z	EdgEy	globe	i figured out a workaround now, if you choose 'browse the armory' and select a search, a normal non-flash input box loads
2007-03-05T11:29:00.000Z	EdgEy		:)
2007-03-05T11:30:00.000Z	globe	EdgEy	cool.  does WOW work well in wine?
2007-03-05T11:30:00.000Z	EdgEy	globe	there is a performance hit, but it's otherwise perfect, apart from i can't get AA to work (it worked fine before a reinstall, user error)
2007-03-05T11:31:00.000Z	globe	EdgEy	hmm.  never thought they would get it to work.  cool.
