2008-06-04T03:42:00.000Z	unavailable		and thats sata
2008-06-04T03:42:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	mm.. I have sata too.. sata II (or whatever they call the faster version)
2008-06-04T03:43:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	yes.. theoretical max is 375 MB/s.. I get 1/20 of that..sigh
2008-06-04T03:44:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	I'm going to try copying in a terminal.. I'm still a bit suspicious about nauitilus and it's file handling
2008-06-04T04:01:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	well.. apparently the terminal isn't much faster.. 17 MB/s
2008-06-10T22:03:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	are there any settings in the gnome-volume-control applet?
2008-06-10T22:04:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	checked the preferences?
2008-06-10T22:04:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	well.. then I'm out of ideas.. might be a secret, "only in the official drivers" thingy
2008-06-10T22:48:00.000Z	unavailable	Slart	do you use the weather thingy in screenlets?
2008-06-10T22:49:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	nope.. I've got a window instead.. updates better and even works when the computer isn't running ;)
2008-06-10T22:50:00.000Z	unavailable	Slart	 well i do and i noticed i had to go into the code and redo the url it checks,  had to remove some affilite crap from it
2008-06-10T22:50:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	hmm.. most annoying
2008-06-10T22:53:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	nope.. a user agent editor thingy..
2008-06-25T02:24:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	isn't that option in the gnome-terminal profile settings? in one of the menus in the terminal window?
2008-07-15T18:43:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	what happens if you try gksudo bash?
2008-07-15T18:44:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	I have no idea how to check if the enviroment is set up correctly though... you'll have to figure that one out for yourself
2008-07-15T19:07:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	why don't you want to use gksudo?
2008-07-15T19:11:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	why not check out the source if you really want to know what gksudo does that sudo doesn't
2008-07-15T19:54:00.000Z	Slart	unavailable	regarding your sudo/gksudo question before.. try running gksudo with the --debug switch.. lots of fun info there
