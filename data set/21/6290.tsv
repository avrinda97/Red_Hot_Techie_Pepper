2007-06-19T11:16:00.000Z	wols	neverblue	no. purge it
2007-06-19T11:17:00.000Z	wols	neverblue	read apt.get manual
2007-06-19T11:18:00.000Z	wols	neverblue	read apt-get manual
2007-06-19T11:18:00.000Z	neverblue	wols	stop talking to me
2007-06-21T09:31:00.000Z	wols	neverblue	no. it depends on kernel. there are some (older) kernels with sata drivers that use hda. few tho
2007-06-21T09:33:00.000Z	wols	neverblue	newer kernel use libata that means sda for all disks
2007-06-21T09:34:00.000Z	wols	neverblue	fdisk -l. what does it say for sda?
2007-06-21T09:35:00.000Z	wols	neverblue	are you sure there is a partition on that disk?
2007-06-21T09:35:00.000Z	wols	neverblue	please don't LIE to me. /dev/sda is not "nothing". what kinds of /dev/sda? use a pastebin
2007-06-21T09:35:00.000Z	neverblue	wols	i dont think you need to assist me anymore
2007-06-21T09:36:00.000Z	wols	neverblue	if you want help, give the ones trying to help you proper info. otherwise this cannot work
2007-06-21T09:36:00.000Z	neverblue	wols	I gave you an answer, and you accuse me of lying
2007-06-21T09:36:00.000Z	wols	neverblue	cause you did. /dev/sda is not nothing
2007-06-21T09:37:00.000Z	wols	neverblue	it's not me who needs help. it's you
2007-06-21T10:35:00.000Z	wols	neverblue	are you ignoring me?
2007-12-20T22:28:00.000Z	neverblue	wols	keep positive ;)
2007-12-20T22:28:00.000Z	wols	neverblue	it will simply use the other NIC now that he uses now to connect to freenode
2007-12-20T22:29:00.000Z	wols	neverblue	which means it won't prove anything
2007-12-20T22:29:00.000Z	neverblue	wols	he is connecting here on that same box, I didnt get that far into the convo....
2007-12-20T22:30:00.000Z	wols	neverblue	but you saw he has two nics with IPs assigned. so a ping would be futile
