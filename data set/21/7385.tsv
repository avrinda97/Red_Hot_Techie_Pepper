2006-10-17T14:52:00.000Z	AWOSDev		Okay does anybody know about permissions?
2006-10-17T14:52:00.000Z	AWOSDev		Well see ^^ for my question or I'll ask it again.
2006-10-17T14:52:00.000Z	AWOSDev		And now it says "you are not a member of the sudoers file.  this will be reported."  well I'm the admin so I don't really so who you're gonna report it to.
2006-10-17T14:53:00.000Z	AWOSDev		I have two user accounts on my computer.  One is UID 1000 and the other is 1004.  1000 can play audio and read/write the various /dev/sound files (e.g. mixer, dsp), but 1004 can't.  Both are members of the audio group (which owns the sound-related /dev/ files).  What could the problem be?
2006-10-17T14:53:00.000Z	jbinder	AWOSDev	thats easy to fix
2006-10-17T14:53:00.000Z	jbinder	AWOSDev	as root, type
2006-10-17T14:53:00.000Z	AWOSDev	jbinder	that's new question.
2006-10-17T14:53:00.000Z	jbinder	AWOSDev	type su
2006-10-17T14:54:00.000Z	AWOSDev	jbinder	I don't have a root password.
2006-10-17T14:54:00.000Z	AWOSDev	jbinder	admin_, no there is no root password.
2006-10-17T14:54:00.000Z	jbinder	AWOSDev	this doesn't make any sense
2006-10-17T14:54:00.000Z	AWOSDev	jbinder	6 user account.
2006-10-17T14:56:00.000Z	jbinder	AWOSDev	PM
2006-10-17T14:56:00.000Z	jbinder	AWOSDev	uh.. what?
2006-10-17T14:56:00.000Z	jbinder	AWOSDev	which is...
2006-10-17T15:02:00.000Z	AWOSDev	jbinder	-- uh...
2006-10-17T15:03:00.000Z	AWOSDev	jbinder	Remember that person that really ran rm -rf / because someone on here told him to?
2006-10-17T15:08:00.000Z	jbinder	AWOSDev	do you still have the same problem?
2006-10-17T15:10:00.000Z	AWOSDev	jbinder	with the /dev/ yes.
2006-10-17T15:10:00.000Z	jbinder	AWOSDev	ok
2006-10-17T15:11:00.000Z	AWOSDev	jbinder	I want everything to stay the same.  UID 1000 can use the sound well, so I know it's something dumb I've done :)
