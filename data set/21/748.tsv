2011-07-07T05:39:00.000Z	nit-wit	alexleon	what happened with the flash aid? #2 Do you have noscript or a script blocker like flashaid or another installed.

2011-07-07T05:41:00.000Z	alexleon	nit-wit	open what? adblock or flash aid?
2011-07-07T05:42:00.000Z	nit-wit	alexleon	flashaid installed the newest adobe flash and removed the installer that is good, open adblock and look for any youtube block or ytming, they would have been done by so at the top of the list.
