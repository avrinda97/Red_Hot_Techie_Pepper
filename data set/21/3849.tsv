2009-12-25T16:24:00.000Z	elzoog		Also, should I bother to make the netbook dual boot?   I definitely want winbugs XP because any software my 8 year old daughter is likely to have will be winbugs software.  But I don't know how a typical 8 year old child would react to linux
2009-12-25T16:26:00.000Z	elzoog		Digital:  Which is better for a netbook, Ubuntu netbook remix, or Ubuntu desktop?
2009-12-25T16:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 either one will work.  I tend to install the UNR then install ubuntu-desktop
2009-12-25T16:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 the netbook remix also may be tweaked a little more for the devices.
2009-12-25T16:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 thats how the EULA from MS works... :)
2009-12-25T16:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 i dont think the XP licening stuff gets activated with just a HD change.
2009-12-25T16:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 #windows would be able to tell you when it gets triggered. I was thinking it was like 3 major hardwaare change's
2009-12-25T16:36:00.000Z	elzoog	Dr_Willis	 The point is, if the hard drive crashes then all of that data is lost (except for the key, which I stored somewhere).   So that would mean if I install a hard drive, and use the old key and then go online to try to authenticate it, it has already been authenticated plus the hardware changed.
2009-12-25T16:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 deoending on the tile btween activations it can get tagged as invalid.
2009-12-25T16:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	  You should call MS and wish them happy new year anyway...
2009-12-25T16:40:00.000Z	elzoog	Dr_Willis	 Problem is, what will replace XP?   Vista sucks (I have that on my laptop).  I haven't heard many good things about Windows 7
2009-12-25T16:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 win7 is replaceing xp. Thats MS's decision basically
2009-12-25T16:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 wont matter how stable xp used to be. I am finding more and more new hardware that has no xp drivers.
2010-09-06T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 you have a disk in teh drive
2010-09-06T17:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 its saying your sr0 = Optical drive  has  ' Incompatible medium installed
2010-09-06T17:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 so DO you have a disk in teh drive?
2010-09-06T17:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 its talking abouyt your CD drive.  pop the disk out and see if you get the same error.
2010-09-06T17:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 thats why it matters
2010-09-06T17:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 sr0 is my cdrom/dvd drive here
2010-09-06T17:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 its just a warning....  about the optical drive..
2010-09-06T17:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	elzoog	 as i said.. take the disk out.. see if it goes away
