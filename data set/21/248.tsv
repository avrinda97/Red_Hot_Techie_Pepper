2012-05-27T23:18:00.000Z	Ephexeve	wilee-nilee	There are, there are
2012-05-27T23:13:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Ephexeve	so you want xubuntu is this correct?
2012-05-27T23:13:00.000Z	Ephexeve	wilee-nilee	Yeah
2012-05-27T23:13:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Ephexeve	hut ctrl-alt-f1 and login and run sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
2012-05-27T23:14:00.000Z	Ephexeve	wilee-nilee	done that, nothing happens
2012-05-27T23:14:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Ephexeve	no error no already installed no nothing?
2012-05-27T23:15:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Ephexeve	can you run a sudo apt-get update?
2012-05-27T23:15:00.000Z	Ephexeve	wilee-nilee	Course not, I only see a course blinking, nothing else
2012-05-27T23:16:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Ephexeve	try the recovery and a cli from there, it has to have the HD mounted is all.
2012-05-27T23:17:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Ephexeve	you could chroot from a live cd.
2012-05-27T23:18:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Ephexeve	arch and ubuntu are both linux hardly any difference
2012-05-27T23:20:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Ephexeve	they seem different at first but both are linux running on the same basic kernels, just slight differences is all.
2012-05-27T23:20:00.000Z	Ephexeve	wilee-nilee	yeah, but check the confs of arch and ubuntu later on and you will see what I mean
2012-05-27T23:21:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Ephexeve	I have run both and just about every major linux release, all the same basically.
2012-05-27T23:21:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Ephexeve	you know how to chroot?
2012-05-27T23:22:00.000Z	Ephexeve	wilee-nilee	Yeps
2012-05-27T23:22:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Ephexeve	chroot to the ubuntu and install the xubuntu-desktop is what I would try
2012-05-27T23:23:00.000Z	Ephexeve	wilee-nilee	will do that, otherwise fedora-it
2012-05-27T23:23:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Ephexeve	yeah fedora is a nice setup,;)
2012-05-27T23:24:00.000Z	Ephexeve	wilee-nilee	Fedora and arch, rules!
2012-05-27T23:24:00.000Z	Ephexeve	wilee-nilee	I must be honest, Ubuntu has ended after 10.10
