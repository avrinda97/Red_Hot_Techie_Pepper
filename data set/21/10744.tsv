2004-11-24T08:28:00.000Z	mat		transcode in marillat's repositery won't install
2004-11-24T08:28:00.000Z	mat		(on warty that is)
2004-11-24T08:28:00.000Z	mat		it needs libjasper, which is nowhere to be found, and libquicktime 0.9.3
2004-11-24T08:28:00.000Z	mat		and warty has 0.9.2 only.
2004-11-24T08:28:00.000Z	ogra	mat	did you try marillat stable ?
2004-11-24T08:28:00.000Z	mat	ogra	not yet, only testing/main right now
2004-11-24T08:35:00.000Z	mat	ogra	read a few lines up, stable doesn't work better for transcode.
2004-11-24T08:40:00.000Z	ogra	mat	could you try : deb http://apt.cerkinfo.be/ unstable main contrib non-free
2004-11-24T08:40:00.000Z	ogra	mat	for transcode
2004-11-24T08:42:00.000Z	mat	ogra	was about to. I just hope this won't induce any problems since it includes packages I have installed from elsewhere (like marillat for instance, which I need for libdvdcss)
2004-11-24T08:43:00.000Z	ogra	mat	may be....libdvdcss2 is in the repo.....
2004-11-24T08:45:00.000Z	mat	ogra	same problems that marillat unstable, plus it wants some libpng that I don't have.
2004-11-24T08:45:00.000Z	ogra	mat	so no transcode...hmm
2004-11-24T08:45:00.000Z	ogra	mat	there are sources though....
2004-11-24T08:46:00.000Z	ogra	mat	on cerkinfo
2004-11-24T08:46:00.000Z	mat	ogra	I have never used deb-src foo before though, so a binary package would be nice :)
2004-11-24T09:32:00.000Z	ogra	mat	hard task :)
2004-11-24T09:33:00.000Z	mat	ogra	I had to change a few things in the dependancies to get it to build
2004-11-24T09:33:00.000Z	ogra	mat	jep, i thought so
2004-11-24T09:34:00.000Z	ogra	mat	yay
2004-11-24T09:34:00.000Z	ogra	mat	lol, me neither
