2006-08-08T08:34:00.000Z	Frankenstein	Madpilot	im not! im trying to find a solution
2006-08-08T08:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	Frankenstein	well, ask an actual question, then. Don't just randomly hit the bot
2006-08-08T08:34:00.000Z	Frankenstein	Madpilot	already have, figured no one could help
2006-08-08T08:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	Frankenstein	what are you trying to do? Burn mp3s onto audio CDs?
2006-08-08T08:36:00.000Z	Frankenstein	Madpilot	yes, using the serpentine burner software... once i try to add the mp3 files it tells me i need the gstreamer plugins which i found with apt-cache and installed, but im not sure exactly which gstreamer packages i need, as i said before
2006-08-08T08:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	Frankenstein	check https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
2006-08-08T08:37:00.000Z	Frankenstein	Madpilot	i can already play mp3's...
2006-08-08T08:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	Frankenstein	then you should be able to use them in Serp
2006-08-08T08:37:00.000Z	Frankenstein	Madpilot	but i cant, hence my question
2006-08-08T08:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	Frankenstein	actually, the problem is probably that Serpentine is using the older gstreamer version
2006-08-08T08:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	Frankenstein	search for gstreamer again, install the 0.8 versions as well as the 0.10 versions - the two can co-exist
2006-08-08T08:38:00.000Z	Frankenstein	Madpilot	ok, ill try that  thanks
2006-08-21T12:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	Frankenstein	there are a number of ops present - what's the problem?
