2007-11-28T13:14:00.000Z	zetheroo		where can I find a list of packages which are installed by Ubuntu Gutsy by default?
2007-11-28T13:14:00.000Z	n2diy	zetheroo	synaptic
2007-11-28T13:14:00.000Z	zetheroo	n2diy	where in synaptic?
2007-11-28T13:15:00.000Z	n2diy	zetheroo	menu > system > admin>synaptic package manager.
2007-11-28T13:16:00.000Z	zetheroo	n2diy	yeah... I know where it is .. but how do I see a list of all the packages which are installed by Ubuntu Gutsy on first install?
2007-11-28T13:17:00.000Z	zetheroo	n2diy	reason is that I think I uninstalled a package which I should not have
2007-11-28T13:17:00.000Z	n2diy	zetheroo	Don't know, I'm running Dapper. Just re-install your app with Synaptic, and it should grab the missing package.
2007-11-28T13:18:00.000Z	zetheroo	n2diy	I am not sure which package it was which I should not have installed... I uninstalled a number of them
2007-11-28T13:19:00.000Z	zetheroo	n2diy	actually all I need to know is which package deals with sound capture in Ubuntu
2007-11-28T13:20:00.000Z	n2diy	zetheroo	Everyone should have a notebook, and keep track of what they do, so you can backtrack stuff like this. zetheroo, try reinstalling alsa?
2007-11-28T13:21:00.000Z	zetheroo	n2diy	ok will try
2007-11-28T13:21:00.000Z	n2diy	zetheroo	Good luck.
2008-12-28T16:13:00.000Z	n2diy	zetheroo	I lost my link to it, but Google for the "Rute Manual"
2008-12-28T16:14:00.000Z	n2diy	zetheroo	everything you wanted to know about linux, plus some.
2008-12-28T16:16:00.000Z	n2diy	zetheroo	you want to play on the command line, right?
2008-12-28T16:17:00.000Z	n2diy	zetheroo	whoops, wrong ze*
2009-04-21T11:15:00.000Z	n2diy	zetheroo	why format before a new install?
2009-04-21T11:16:00.000Z	n2diy	zetheroo	hotdog, and why install? shouldn't apt-get upgrade work?
2009-04-21T11:18:00.000Z	n2diy	zetheroo	ok, do you leave /home alone? If not, what is your backup and restore routine?
2009-04-21T11:21:00.000Z	n2diy	zetheroo	ok, what are you using to move your files/archives around? I'm trying to figure out a good backup/restore system for my LAN here.
2009-04-21T11:24:00.000Z	n2diy	zetheroo	ok, so have you tried to do a restore? I found that it is the "less" part that kills you doing a restore. Missing, broken links, etc.. are a PITA to fix.
