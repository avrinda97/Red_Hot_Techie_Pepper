2009-05-02T12:43:00.000Z	shadeslayer	hmw	yeah im having problems setting up a adhoc network
2009-05-02T12:44:00.000Z	hmw	shadeslayer	this could be a different problem, though. I never managed to get an adhoc net running. :(
2009-05-02T12:51:00.000Z	hmw	shadeslayer	manually adding the address wont solve the problem. His NM doesnt want to work with the wifi controlller.
2009-05-02T12:52:00.000Z	shadeslayer	hmw	what about through iwconfig and ifconfig
2009-05-02T12:52:00.000Z	hmw	shadeslayer	i never made it work by manually doing stuff. Same goes for HSDPA modems. There must be some hidden magic somewhere.
2009-05-05T13:11:00.000Z	hmw	shadeslayer	Gnea: some sound cards seem not to have this boost option, and i suspect, that it wont be listed, if that is the case...?
2009-05-05T13:12:00.000Z	shadeslayer	hmw	no such option in windows
2009-05-05T13:13:00.000Z	hmw	shadeslayer	i didnt follow your whole comversation... do you get at least something from the mike, or is it 100% silent?
2009-05-05T13:13:00.000Z	shadeslayer	hmw	i get *very* little sound
2009-05-05T13:15:00.000Z	hmw	shadeslayer	ic. I am not a sound expert, especially not under linux *G*, but I see some options: You could get a new sound card or a better (active) microphone, or you could patch the mike through your Home Stereo for having a normal 5V line in signal, which you can record on your PC
2009-05-05T13:17:00.000Z	hmw	shadeslayer	what software are you using for recording?
2009-05-05T13:18:00.000Z	shadeslayer	hmw	sound recorder,audacity
2009-05-05T13:18:00.000Z	shadeslayer	hmw	i have to go for now,ill be back in 30 min
2009-05-06T21:15:00.000Z	shadeslayer	hmw	you cant ;),you have to change the theme
2009-05-06T21:16:00.000Z	hmw	shadeslayer	it uses the normal "start-here.svg", so I guess every theme would have an Icon there. On the other hand, I already had a menu with only text, and forgot, how I did it.
2009-05-06T21:16:00.000Z	hmw	shadeslayer	maybe I turned off Icons for everything, in the menu too
2009-05-06T21:17:00.000Z	shadeslayer	hmw	well i dont know for sure but i changed my theme today and the icon changed
2009-05-06T21:22:00.000Z	hmw	shadeslayer	I am using the Minty-Fresh theme, but I dont like the Linux-Mint icon on a Ubuntu desktop. I simply replaced ~/.icons/Minty-Fresh/scalable/places/start-here.svg with /usr/share/icons/Human/scalable/places/start-here.svg, thus "touching" the theme, which I wanted to avoid, but it shows the Ubuntu Icon again
2009-05-06T21:22:00.000Z	shadeslayer	hmw	seriously no idea
2009-05-06T21:22:00.000Z	hmw	shadeslayer	this was a solution, i wanted to share with you. Thanks for your attention!
2009-05-06T21:23:00.000Z	shadeslayer	hmw	ok..thnx for the indo
