2006-09-13T14:00:00.000Z	recon0		I'm switching from ubuntu to xubuntu. What package should I remove to remove gnome?
2006-09-13T14:01:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	recon0	just install xubuntu-desktop
2006-09-13T14:01:00.000Z	recon0	ciscosurfer	I'm pressed for space. If I'm not using gnome, I want to uninstall it.
2006-09-13T14:02:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	recon0	you can try removing ubuntu-desktop first (that will remove GNOME) then install xubuntu-desktop....
2006-09-13T14:02:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	recon0	that should do it...but make sure first
2006-09-13T14:03:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	recon0	sorry for the non-descript answer
2006-09-13T14:03:00.000Z	recon0	ciscosurfer	make sure what?
2006-09-13T14:03:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	recon0	let me look to see if GNOME came in a metapackage that you can uninstall
2006-09-13T14:04:00.000Z	recon0	ciscosurfer	...
2006-09-13T14:05:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	recon0	have you tried to remove GNOME yet?
2006-09-13T14:05:00.000Z	recon0	ciscosurfer	nope.
2006-09-13T14:05:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	recon0	 go to a terminal and type 'sudo aptitude remove gnome'  see what happens
2006-09-13T14:06:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	recon0	should pull all dependencies with it
2006-09-13T14:06:00.000Z	recon0	ciscosurfer	OK, just as soon as my other apt proccess finishes.
2006-09-13T14:06:00.000Z	recon0	ciscosurfer	btw, i remeber a program that found unused dependencies and libraries. do you happen to know the name?
2006-09-13T14:08:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	recon0	Synaptic will automatically resolve dependencies (apt-get will as well with certain switches at the command line) Aptitude will resolve automatically
2006-09-13T14:09:00.000Z	recon0	ciscosurfer	nothing happened.
2006-09-13T14:10:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	recon0	sorry ;-(
2006-09-13T14:10:00.000Z	recon0	ciscosurfer	Evidently, that metapackage isn't installed.
2006-09-13T14:10:00.000Z	recon0	ciscosurfer	what if I apt-get it then aptitude remove it?
2006-09-13T14:11:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	recon0	you can try that, but I don't think you'll have any luck that way either
