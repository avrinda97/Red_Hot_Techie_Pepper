2010-01-04T14:53:00.000Z	Homely_Girl_	vox	Did u say something to me, sorry system crashed. :(
2010-01-04T14:54:00.000Z	Homely_Girl_	vox	I have a windows partition!! lol The 15gb was given 2 me by a possible Windows user. There is nothing I need on that drive.
2010-01-04T14:56:00.000Z	vox	Homely_Girl_	oh, thats easy then. sudo apt-get install gparted
2010-01-04T14:57:00.000Z	Homely_Girl_	vox	Besides needing a password when I log into my pc...is there anyway I can get the system to stop asking for my password? I live alone!! lol
2010-01-04T14:59:00.000Z	vox	Homely_Girl_	not that i'm overtly familiar with. linux is designed to have large amounts of security
2010-01-04T14:59:00.000Z	Homely_Girl_	vox	and this is why it's superior to other o/s's!! lol
2010-01-04T14:59:00.000Z	vox	Homely_Girl_	once gparted is installed, click on System -> Administration -> Gparted
2010-01-04T15:00:00.000Z	Homely_Girl_	vox	I'm there now.
2010-01-04T15:01:00.000Z	vox	Homely_Girl_	ok, in the top right there's a drop-down menu of the disks in your system. one will say "/dev/sda" and the other "/dev/sdb/".  select the second one
2010-01-04T15:01:00.000Z	Homely_Girl_	vox	Got it, next instruction plse? :)
2010-01-04T15:03:00.000Z	vox	Homely_Girl_	you should be able to right-click on each partition, deleting them as you work upwards
2010-01-04T15:04:00.000Z	Homely_Girl_	vox	done, but it shows as 13,99gb, is that normal for a 15gb? :P
2010-01-04T15:04:00.000Z	Homely_Girl_	vox	it just says it's unallocated now, do we need to give it a name? :)
2010-01-04T15:04:00.000Z	vox	Homely_Girl_	yeah, it's 15gb in marketing terms, not technical terms..
2010-01-04T15:05:00.000Z	vox	Homely_Girl_	next you need to go to Partition up the top
2010-01-04T15:05:00.000Z	vox	Homely_Girl_	err, Device
2010-01-04T15:05:00.000Z	vox	Homely_Girl_	then select "Create Partition Table"
2010-01-04T15:06:00.000Z	Homely_Girl_	vox	then click on create 'n erase the entire disc?
2010-01-04T15:06:00.000Z	vox	Homely_Girl_	gah one moment
2010-01-04T15:07:00.000Z	Homely_Girl_	vox	Yes I see partition table type, which one do I want?
2010-01-04T15:09:00.000Z	vox	Homely_Girl_	ok, sorry, my bad. go to Partition, then click New
