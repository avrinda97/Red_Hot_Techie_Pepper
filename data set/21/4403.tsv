2008-05-03T01:57:00.000Z	guest	mib_ma5qwk	thats new to me then, have you tried playing it with vlc? it has libdvdcss built-in
2008-05-03T02:01:00.000Z	mib_ma5qwk	guest	i was worried abuot that, thanks for your help
2008-05-03T01:58:00.000Z	mib_ma5qwk	guest	yeah actually, it just closes itself. when i opened it using terminal, it said that "there was nothing to play"
2008-05-03T01:59:00.000Z	guest	mib_ma5qwk	have you tried other another DVD?
2008-05-03T01:59:00.000Z	mib_ma5qwk	guest	yes, they all fail but when i tried one about a half an hour ago,it worked fine.
2008-05-03T01:59:00.000Z	mib_ma5qwk	guest	i can browse the dvd but not play it
2008-05-03T02:00:00.000Z	guest	mib_ma5qwk	do other CDs play normally?
2008-05-03T02:00:00.000Z	mib_ma5qwk	guest	i don't have anny around to test
2008-05-03T02:01:00.000Z	guest	mib_ma5qwk	i'm guessing, if one dvd worked before and now it doesnt, its either a faulty drive or a dusty one. other than that, i'm not sure.
