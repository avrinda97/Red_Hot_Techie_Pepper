2008-11-10T10:27:00.000Z	mindrape	cpro	- sudo dhclient wlan0
2008-11-10T10:27:00.000Z	mindrape	cpro	- if you have a WEP key then you will need to use iwconfig to set that as well.. man iwconfig
2008-11-10T10:31:00.000Z	cpro	mindrape	iwconfig is not working
2008-11-10T10:32:00.000Z	mindrape	cpro	- sudo iwconfig         what does it say?
2008-11-10T10:32:00.000Z	cpro	mindrape	its not changing my current essid
2008-11-10T10:32:00.000Z	mindrape	cpro	- sudo ifconfig        what is the list of network adapters available?  maybe you dont have wlan0
2008-11-10T10:32:00.000Z	cpro	mindrape	i did sudo but it says nothing but my essid always remains the same
2008-11-10T10:36:00.000Z	cpro	mindrape	i have eth1 i tried everything u told me
2008-11-10T10:36:00.000Z	mindrape	cpro	- well then its not recognizing your wireless card if all you have is eth1 probably...
2008-11-10T10:36:00.000Z	mindrape	cpro	- lspci, lsmod, dmesg... do you see your card in any of those?
2008-11-10T10:37:00.000Z	cpro	mindrape	but my internet is working
2008-11-10T10:37:00.000Z	mindrape	cpro	- are you plugged in through ethernet?

2008-11-10T10:38:00.000Z	mindrape	cpro	- sudo iwconfig... it is blank?

2008-11-10T10:39:00.000Z	cpro	mindrape	ya its blank
2008-11-10T10:39:00.000Z	mindrape	cpro	- well I have no idea then.  Technically that is impossible as far as I'm concerned.
2008-11-10T10:39:00.000Z	cpro	mindrape	ya i know its really sounding impossible
