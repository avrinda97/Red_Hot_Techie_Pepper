2005-07-26T07:20:00.000Z	jeran		Why does firefox run when I type 'sudo firefox' but not only 'firefox' and it works when I do 'firefox -ProfileManager'
2005-07-26T07:20:00.000Z	jeran		but not when I type 'firefox' rather
2005-07-26T07:21:00.000Z	bob2	jeran	perhaps your firefox user data is screwed
2005-07-26T07:21:00.000Z	bob2	jeran	does moving ~/firefox out of the way fix it?
2005-07-26T07:22:00.000Z	jeran	bob2	It says no such directory
2005-07-26T07:22:00.000Z	bob2	jeran	~/.mozilla/firefox, then
2005-07-26T07:23:00.000Z	jeran	bob2	No such directory again
2005-07-26T07:23:00.000Z	bob2	jeran	how odd
2005-07-26T07:24:00.000Z	jeran	bob2	I can create a new profile and it loads up just fine.. I just had a lot of trouble with firefox earlier and I did an apt-get remove of it and it's been doing this ever since I tried to reinstall it
2005-07-26T07:24:00.000Z	bob2	jeran	removing it won't have affected this
2005-07-26T07:24:00.000Z	jeran	bob2	This all started because I was trying to upgrade firefox *sigh*
2005-07-26T07:27:00.000Z	jeran	bob2	It would probably be easier to just reinstall ubuntu, lol
2005-07-26T07:27:00.000Z	jeran	bob2	I was trying to update firefox because of the security patches..
2005-07-26T07:28:00.000Z	bob2	jeran	I really doubt reinstalling is a useful course of action
2005-07-26T07:28:00.000Z	bob2	jeran	er, that was silly, the version in ubuntu has all those security patches
2005-07-26T07:28:00.000Z	jeran	bob2	I had 1.0.2 installed and apt-get told me that there were updates avaiable.
2005-07-26T07:28:00.000Z	bob2	jeran	yes, which have the patches applied to 1.0.2
2005-07-26T07:32:00.000Z	jeran	bob2	So.. Am I just screwed over and no way to fix my problem?
2005-07-26T07:33:00.000Z	bob2	jeran	of course not
2005-07-26T07:33:00.000Z	bob2	jeran	presumably, getting rid of your local firefox data would fix it;you never explained how you broke it to begin with, though
2005-07-26T07:33:00.000Z	bob2	jeran	if it involved "backports", then you have to talk to them
