2009-03-16T18:58:00.000Z	hx		Important question, I noticed that ubuntu 8.04 doesnt detect HD in my new MB, while 8.10 does. I believe that the cause is sata drivers/raid
2009-03-16T18:58:00.000Z	hx		how i can integrate does drivers? if that were the problem.
2009-03-16T18:59:00.000Z	hx		right if is ahci they are running sata not IDE. 8.10 detect them without problem . 8.04 doesnt show partitions.
2009-03-16T19:01:00.000Z	hx		why not php5?
2009-03-16T19:01:00.000Z	zamba	hx	because some code written for php4 doesn't work for php5
2009-03-16T19:04:00.000Z	hx	zamba	found some reference for you: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=796515
2009-03-16T19:04:00.000Z	hx	zamba	take a look there.
2009-03-16T19:09:00.000Z	zamba	hx	problem with that is that php4-cgi isn't in any repositories
2009-03-16T19:09:00.000Z	zamba	hx	so it won't help me one bit
2009-03-16T19:16:00.000Z	hx	zamba	sorry man but php4 has been completely replaced with php5 . SO they remove it from repos.
2009-03-16T19:16:00.000Z	hx	zamba	you will have to compile it.

2009-03-16T19:17:00.000Z	zamba	hx	why do they do this.. i understand that they want people to use php5 and mysql5 and all that, but why not just leave the packages there and let people install it using a force option or something
2009-03-16T19:18:00.000Z	hx	zamba	maybe you may try php5 and try resolving issues. Its the best for you
2009-03-16T19:18:00.000Z	zamba	hx	it's not my code
2009-03-16T19:18:00.000Z	zamba	hx	and it's HUGE
2009-03-16T19:19:00.000Z	hx	zamba	are you sure it wont work?
2009-03-16T19:20:00.000Z	zamba	hx	it "works".. but i have a couple of errors and the developers won't touch it since we're running it on php5, since they say that it is only guaranteed to work on php4
2009-03-16T19:20:00.000Z	hx	zamba	Support for PHP 4 has been discontinued since 2007-12-31. Please consider upgrading to PHP 5.2."
2009-03-16T19:21:00.000Z	hx	zamba	well thats a bad practice. THey should try upgrade it to php5.
2009-03-16T19:23:00.000Z	hx	zamba	install apache from repos. then compile php 4.
