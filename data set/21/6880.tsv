2007-01-11T07:44:00.000Z	stefg	madcheeze	so you tried to build your /own/ kernel and install that, it's not that a ubuntu-kernel-update hosed your box?
2007-01-11T07:47:00.000Z	stefg	madcheeze	or boot the Live-CD, mount your installed system, chroot into the system and do an apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade from within the chroot. That should restore the newest kernel and let you boot again

2007-01-11T07:50:00.000Z	stefg	madcheeze	does your wlan require encryption?

2007-01-11T07:51:00.000Z	stefg	madcheeze	then it can be a firmware issue, or the router not understanding the dhcp request from your wlan-adapter

2007-01-11T07:53:00.000Z	stefg	madcheeze	the wired interfaces are notmally called eth[1-9] , but the wireless interfaces have different names for different wlan adapters
