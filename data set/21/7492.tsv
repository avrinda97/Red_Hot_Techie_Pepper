2012-10-14T17:47:00.000Z	kim_		fsck on a 70GB lvm partition takes hours and failed with "out of memory - killed". Any idea?
2012-10-14T17:48:00.000Z	ikonia	kim_	what fiel system is on it ?
2012-10-14T17:48:00.000Z	kim_	ikonia	ext4
2012-10-14T17:48:00.000Z	ikonia	kim_	stupid quetion, but is there a problem on it to make you want to fsck it ?
2012-10-14T17:49:00.000Z	kim_	ikonia	Got some processes going into D, rebootet the server, and trying to do a fsck
2012-10-14T17:49:00.000Z	ikonia	kim_	going into D ?
2012-10-14T17:50:00.000Z	kim_	ikonia	uninterruptible sleep
2012-10-14T17:50:00.000Z	ikonia	kim_	I'd be very concerned if your san had that much latency fsck was timing out
2012-10-14T17:51:00.000Z	kim_	ikonia	fsck is not timing out, but seems to be "find / |xargs rm" was the first process going into uninterruptible sleep
2012-10-14T17:51:00.000Z	ikonia	kim_	how many disks are making up the volume group that the logical volume is in
2012-10-14T17:51:00.000Z	kim_	ikonia	two
2012-10-14T17:52:00.000Z	ikonia	kim_	fsck is timing out if it's giving an out of memory error
2012-10-14T17:52:00.000Z	kim_	ikonia	aha, i see
2012-10-14T17:52:00.000Z	ikonia	kim_	are they both san based ?
2012-10-14T17:52:00.000Z	kim_	ikonia	yes, same specification
2012-10-14T17:52:00.000Z	ikonia	kim_	ok - suggestion to help find out what's going on
2012-10-14T17:53:00.000Z	ikonia	kim_	open a second xterm, and in the second xterm use iostat to monitor the two disks in question for 5 - 10 minutes,
2012-10-14T17:53:00.000Z	ikonia	kim_	get an idea for what's going on
2012-10-14T17:53:00.000Z	ikonia	kim_	then issue the fsck and see how they respond during the process
2012-10-14T18:03:00.000Z	kim_	ikonia	iostat seems to be normal
2012-10-14T18:03:00.000Z	ikonia	kim_	well, that's one good thing at least
