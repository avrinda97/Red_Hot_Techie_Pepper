2007-02-13T17:26:00.000Z	BigMac		Hey when I load I get anerror that my x server gui fails to load
2007-02-13T17:26:00.000Z	BigMac		is there a way to load in safe mode
2007-02-13T17:26:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	no. well, there's recovery mode, but that will just bring you to a console.
2007-02-13T17:26:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	just type  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  and select the VESA driver, for a safe mode
2007-02-13T17:27:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	however... do you have Edgy and third-party nvidia or ati drivers?
2007-02-13T17:28:00.000Z	BigMac	LjL	I have edgy and ati drivers because I was trying to install beryl
2007-02-13T17:28:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	and when did this problem appear? after you rebooted yesterday or such perhaps?
2007-02-13T17:30:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	there has been a kernel upgrade, and ati and nvidia drivers won't work anymore unless you update them.
2007-02-13T17:34:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	uh, you can't boot? didn't you say that you just couldn't get X started?
2007-02-13T17:35:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	server mode?
2007-02-13T17:36:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	you aren't on Feisty, are you?
2007-02-13T17:36:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	well, see if you can just press Alt+F2 or Alt+F3 and get a "login" prompt, after X doesn't start
2007-02-13T17:37:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	if you do, then just type  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  and select the VESA driver (as for the rest of the question, press Enter on the defaults)
2007-02-13T17:51:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	i told you - just press Enter.
2007-02-13T17:51:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	the important one is the selection of the graphics driver (VESA)
2007-02-13T17:52:00.000Z	BigMac	LjL	I put Ati because I have an ati card.....
2007-02-13T17:56:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	no, shouldn't be, since "ati" means you'll use the open-source drivers rather than the (currently broken, it seems) binary drivers
2007-02-13T17:56:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	if it still doesn't work, however, try with VESA
2007-02-13T17:56:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	err, i'm not at your exclusive service, you know, i'm in a couple of other channels and doing other stuff as well
2007-02-13T17:58:00.000Z	LjL	BigMac	there ARE defaults. what i told you is to FOLLOW the defaults, EXCEPT for the part where it asks about the driver (that is, the first part). just press Enter at the other questions!
2007-02-13T06:00:00.000Z	BigMac	LjL	so just select ati and hit ente for everything else?
