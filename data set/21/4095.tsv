2008-07-13T18:33:00.000Z	lazertek_	plouffe	you are using 32bit hardy right?
2008-07-13T18:34:00.000Z	plouffe	lazertek_	I followed the instructions on that page before but it didn't work for me :( (64bit hardy)
2008-07-13T18:35:00.000Z	lazertek_	plouffe	64bit... always something doesn't work right... that's why I use the 32bit... are you sure you did exactly as the instructions showed
2008-07-13T18:36:00.000Z	plouffe	lazertek_	thanks for the help though. Yes I followed the instructions exactly, then later I found a link to remove the ndiswrapper and it at least made the card visible in network manager
2008-07-13T18:36:00.000Z	lazertek_	plouffe	whatever works
