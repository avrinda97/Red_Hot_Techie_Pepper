2008-11-14T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	burner	<merge key="input.x11_options.TapButton1" type="string">0</merge>     try  changing 0 to 1
2008-11-14T06:50:00.000Z	jrib	burner	I'll grab my macbook if that doesn't work
2008-11-14T06:50:00.000Z	burner	jrib	i changed it to a 1, restarted hal via sudo /etc/init.d/hal restart, and still no single finger tap-click
2008-11-14T06:50:00.000Z	burner	jrib	sure it works for you even?  another friend of mine has a macbook with the same issue

2008-11-14T06:55:00.000Z	jrib	burner	yep, it works.  Just delete or comment the TapButton1 line altogether
2008-11-14T06:56:00.000Z	burner	jrib	wow, thanks... i tried every number in there 0 to 10, but didn't think to wipe it out altogether :)
