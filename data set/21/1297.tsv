2012-02-08T20:47:00.000Z	Scarra3_		is there anyone who can help me?
2012-02-08T20:47:00.000Z	theadmin	Scarra3_	You need to ask the question first
2012-02-08T20:47:00.000Z	Scarra3_	theadmin	I have asked it many times for the past 3 days lol
2012-02-08T20:48:00.000Z	theadmin	Scarra3_	Just load the driver for the ATI in the xorg.conf, I suppose that shall make it ignore the nvidia
2012-02-08T20:49:00.000Z	Scarra3_	theadmin	the problem is that ubuntu will not boot with 2 video cards
2012-02-08T20:49:00.000Z	theadmin	Scarra3_	That's not really a problem. Append "text" to the kernel line and boot into text mode, after which do what I said
2012-02-08T20:50:00.000Z	Scarra3_	theadmin	plus I don't know how to install the drivers theres always somthing about turning off xserver
2012-02-08T20:51:00.000Z	theadmin	Scarra3_	Meh. sudo apt-get install fglrx # For ATI drivers
2012-02-08T21:00:00.000Z	Scarra3_	theadmin	Shouldn't I go with the drivers from ATI's website?
2012-02-08T21:00:00.000Z	theadmin	Scarra3_	No. Don't unless you're sure you need them... Repositories make more sense
2012-02-08T21:01:00.000Z	Scarra3_	theadmin	But arn't the drivers from ATI's website made specificly for my card
2012-02-08T21:03:00.000Z	theadmin	Scarra3_	No, lol, you think you're special? There's pretty much a single driver for most ATI cards nowadays
2012-02-08T21:03:00.000Z	theadmin	Scarra3_	fglrx, that is
2012-02-08T21:03:00.000Z	Scarra3_	theadmin	So the fglrx drivers are better and the ATI ones?
2012-02-08T21:04:00.000Z	theadmin	Scarra3_	Err... They ARE the ATI drivers
2012-02-08T21:04:00.000Z	Scarra3_	theadmin	I thought they were ones created by other individuals not by ati
2012-02-08T21:08:00.000Z	Scarra3_	theadmin	are the fglrx drivers automatically in ubuntu 11.10 or do I need to install them seperatly
2012-02-08T21:08:00.000Z	theadmin	Scarra3_	They're propertiary so we don't include them on the CD. You need to do "sudo apt-get install fglrx"
2012-02-08T21:10:00.000Z	theadmin	Scarra3_	"iwlist wlan0 scan" returns anything?
2012-02-08T21:11:00.000Z	theadmin	Scarra3_	If it does, your wireless likely works :D
2012-02-08T21:13:00.000Z	theadmin	Scarra3_	If you have more than 3 GB of RAM you *really* should use the 64-bit version, otherwise you'll be wasting system resources
