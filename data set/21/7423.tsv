2006-10-12T07:40:00.000Z	ellioTb		can nautilus browse mac networks?
2006-10-12T07:41:00.000Z	ellioTb		then do a apt-get update, then apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-10-12T07:41:00.000Z	ellioTb		lol, i win
2006-10-12T07:41:00.000Z	ellioTb		anyone ever browsed an osx network from ubuntu?
2006-10-12T07:41:00.000Z	ellioTb		i want to get on the one at school tomorrow when i take my laptop
2006-10-12T07:43:00.000Z	ellioTb		i just can't find a good samba browser besides nautilus
2006-10-12T07:43:00.000Z	ellioTb		(i am in xubuntu right now)
2006-10-12T07:43:00.000Z	Volstrup	ellioTb	smb4k
2006-10-12T07:43:00.000Z	ellioTb	Volstrup	thanks bud
2006-10-12T07:44:00.000Z	Volstrup	ellioTb	just be aware that smb4k mounts instead of just browsing, so you'll have to use some other filemanager to watch/open the files.
2006-10-12T07:45:00.000Z	ellioTb	Volstrup	thats fine, just the mac network is so confusing at school, i just use smbmount for windows shares, but those osx are a lil diff
2006-10-12T07:46:00.000Z	ellioTb	Volstrup	works perfect!
2006-10-12T07:47:00.000Z	Volstrup	ellioTb	I know :)
2006-10-12T07:48:00.000Z	Volstrup	ellioTb	I've used quite some time trying out different samba browsers - the perfect sollution would be some kind of merge between the way nautilus handles samba and the way smb4k handles it
2006-10-12T07:49:00.000Z	Volstrup		and again! And it's beeping while i just stare at my screen... VERY mysterious
2006-10-12T07:49:00.000Z	ellioTb	Volstrup	the trick would be having a really nice way to browse/mount osx shares
2006-10-12T07:50:00.000Z	Volstrup	ellioTb	I know nothing about those shares - is it something similar to samba?
2006-10-12T07:50:00.000Z	Volstrup		my computer just keeps om beeping - very alarming!
2006-10-12T07:50:00.000Z	ellioTb	Volstrup	i think it is if the osx servers enable windows file sharing, otherwise its something else weird
2006-10-12T07:51:00.000Z	ellioTb	Volstrup	overheating!
2006-10-12T07:51:00.000Z	Volstrup	ellioTb	I don't think so - usually it's below 35C degrees
