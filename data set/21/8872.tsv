2005-12-28T10:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	martianpenguin  is right just make sure you cd to where it is
2005-12-28T10:40:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	i dont think there is thats what checkinstall does (i think)
2005-12-28T10:41:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	the install file will run you through the compiling process
2005-12-28T10:42:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	before you start make sure you have a few things like build-essential and apt-get build-dep <packagename>
2005-12-28T10:46:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	lol its not building its installing libs you need to build it
2005-12-28T10:46:00.000Z	kotton	gnomefreak	wups well what ever it is doing it is doing it well
2005-12-28T10:46:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	 good but you have a while to go
2005-12-28T10:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	when thats done sudo apt-get install build-essential
2005-12-28T10:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	and any other libs the install or readme file tells you you need
2005-12-28T10:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	apt-get will not work on a .tar
2005-12-28T10:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	 read the INSTALL file
2005-12-28T10:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	after your done reading the file cd into the newly created file than run ./configure --help
2005-12-28T10:55:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	 you might want that too
2005-12-28T10:55:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	 did you cd to the new file yet?
2005-12-28T10:56:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	 ok good now run ./configure --help let me know if stuff comes up
2005-12-28T10:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	 you didnt need the tar
2005-12-28T10:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	you have a choice you can continue to learn to compile from source or quit while your ahead and enable universe
2005-12-28T11:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	 use synaptic and search for it in there
2005-12-29T08:44:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kotton	 use pastebin
