2006-05-19T08:18:00.000Z	needlez		the simplest things are the things you dont think of
2006-05-19T08:20:00.000Z	needlez		oh, this may seem like a tricky question. and i dont even know if it is possible, but i have a microsoft multimedia keyboard (i can control winamp and stuff like volume, pause, play, stop, forward, and backwards in my playlist from my keyboard) does anyone know if i can use these features with linux?
2006-05-19T08:21:00.000Z	paradizelost	needlez	IIRC, xev will give you the code that the keys do

2006-05-19T08:22:00.000Z	needlez		how do i run xev?
2006-05-19T08:22:00.000Z	paradizelost		then press the key, it will tell you the code for the button press and the button release
