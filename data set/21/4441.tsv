2008-04-26T11:48:00.000Z	androver		shadow_x: yes!  what program do you want to use the samba share from?
2008-04-26T11:48:00.000Z	Shadow_X	androver	i'd really like to be able to access the share from anything
2008-04-26T11:49:00.000Z	Shadow_X	androver	i'll be using wine-installed apps to access them, as well as various programs within my local system itself
2008-04-26T12:03:00.000Z	Shadow_X	androver	its not working
2008-04-26T12:04:00.000Z	androver	Shadow_X	what have you done so far?
2008-04-26T12:05:00.000Z	androver	Shadow_X	but you did see your stuff when you ran smbclient, right?
2008-04-26T12:06:00.000Z	Shadow_X	androver	correct. i already have the samba shares mounted on my desktop as network servers. however, i need them mounted within the local filesystem as other devices would be
2008-04-26T12:08:00.000Z	androver	Shadow_X	can you paste the exact command that you tried in here?  the mount -t command?
2008-04-26T12:10:00.000Z	androver	Shadow_X	and the message it returned?
2008-04-26T12:12:00.000Z	androver	Shadow_X	something is strange then.  stupid question: what does "which mount" return?
2008-04-26T12:14:00.000Z	androver	Shadow_X	can you do a paste at http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/ with your shell output?  blank out the password, but paste in everything you typed and all the responses.
2008-04-26T12:15:00.000Z	Shadow_X	androver	odd, now its denying me access to mounting
2008-04-26T12:16:00.000Z	androver	Shadow_X	paste it in the pastebin, reply with the url
2008-04-26T12:18:00.000Z	Shadow_X	androver	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/8186/
2008-04-26T12:19:00.000Z	androver	Shadow_X	rough.  looks like windows is denying the connection.  try the smbclient again, see what it does.
2008-04-26T12:20:00.000Z	androver	Shadow_X	why are you using samba to share then?
2008-04-26T12:21:00.000Z	androver	Shadow_X	it's a whole lot easier to share stuff over scp or something like that than over samba
2008-04-26T12:21:00.000Z	Shadow_X	androver	because i have a windows workstation that i use for production purposes, and need access to my fileserve, which is running Debian
2008-04-26T12:22:00.000Z	androver	Shadow_X	gotcha
2008-04-26T12:23:00.000Z	androver	Shadow_X	you're gonna have to figure out why the smb connection isn't working...it'll probably be a combination of checking the smb logs on the server and output from smbclient on the client
2008-04-26T12:23:00.000Z	Shadow_X	androver	thanks
