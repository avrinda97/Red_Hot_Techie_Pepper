2010-08-03T19:52:00.000Z	trongthanh		my xubuntu lucid install seems to be growing, without me doing anything
2010-08-03T19:52:00.000Z	trongthanh		it started at 2.5GB, now is 3.1 GB
2010-08-03T19:53:00.000Z	tesuji	trongthanh	what do you mean by growing?
2010-08-03T19:54:00.000Z	tesuji	trongthanh	by how much is it growing?
2010-08-03T19:55:00.000Z	trongthanh	tesuji	can you help, do you have any idea
2010-08-03T19:56:00.000Z	tesuji	trongthanh	hang on i have to research
2010-08-03T20:24:00.000Z	tesuji	trongthanh	there are utilities to rotate logs - let me check how to configure
2010-08-03T20:26:00.000Z	tesuji	trongthanh	the command is "logrotate" - open a terminal and do "man logrotate" - are you comfortable at the command line?
2010-08-03T20:27:00.000Z	trongthanh	tesuji	yes I'm ok with CLI
2010-08-03T20:27:00.000Z	tesuji	trongthanh	i have been away from the console for awhile - how did you decide the problem is growing log files?
2010-08-03T20:28:00.000Z	trongthanh	tesuji	well someday I remember syslog was only 70MB, now it's 160 MB
2010-08-03T20:28:00.000Z	tesuji	trongthanh	what is your system doing that would create 500megs of logfiles a day?
2010-08-03T20:29:00.000Z	tesuji	trongthanh	do you read your log files?  something is logging a lot of information - you may need to configure syslog too
2010-08-03T20:30:00.000Z	trongthanh	tesuji	I'm afraid of opening a file that big, maybe I have to now
2010-08-03T20:30:00.000Z	tesuji	trongthanh	use less
2010-08-03T20:30:00.000Z	tesuji	trongthanh	less can read a file of any size
2010-08-03T20:31:00.000Z	trongthanh	tesuji	thanks I'll try now and tell you what's in it
2010-08-03T20:31:00.000Z	tesuji	trongthanh	you move around in the file with same commands as vi, eg G to end of file
2010-08-03T20:31:00.000Z	trongthanh	tesuji	well syslog contain a lot of this: Aug  2 10:28:43 trongthanh-pc kernel: [ 6439.087787] vc032x: I2c Bus Busy Wait 2c
2010-08-03T20:31:00.000Z	tesuji	trongthanh	and 1G to top of file
2010-08-03T20:32:00.000Z	tesuji	trongthanh	i cannot interpret your file
