2006-07-15T13:01:00.000Z	dark^ngel		I try
2006-07-15T13:02:00.000Z	dark^ngel		I hated being told RTFM when I was learning Unix
2006-07-15T13:02:00.000Z	dark^ngel		 ... cuz I had already read the stuff and that's why I was asking
2006-07-15T13:04:00.000Z	dark^ngel		Wow ... most definitely (five or six times) alnokta
2006-07-15T13:04:00.000Z	dark^ngel		ok ... pwd
2006-07-15T13:05:00.000Z	dark^ngel		Get the install script
2006-07-15T13:06:00.000Z	dark^ngel		.
2006-07-15T13:08:00.000Z	dark^ngel		Actually, I'm not familiar with pastebin
2006-07-15T13:08:00.000Z	dark^ngel		and certainly the error log will flood you out of here
2006-07-15T13:09:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dark^ngel	just use rafb.net/paste or something. Nothing to understand.
2006-07-15T13:09:00.000Z	dark^ngel		Will that work with Lynx?
2006-07-15T13:10:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dark^ngel	never tried. I guess, if Lynx support posting with forms, then, yes, it should. Don't hang me if I'm right though. :)
2006-07-15T13:11:00.000Z	dark^ngel		Lynx doesn't do tables and forms very pretty
2006-07-15T13:11:00.000Z	dark^ngel		and I'm not needing to post, just view
2006-07-15T13:13:00.000Z	dark^ngel		I'm puzzling over it, Dusty_
2006-07-15T13:13:00.000Z	dark^ngel		def: multitasking -- the ability to screw many things up at the same time.
2006-07-15T13:14:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dark^ngel	it works just fine.. I didn't see the url to the paste, but it's available in Recent pastes on the site.
2006-07-15T13:15:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dark^ngel	it displays pastes just fine.
2006-07-15T13:15:00.000Z	dark^ngel	XiXaQ	what url again (please)?
2006-07-15T13:15:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dark^ngel	http://rafb.net/paste to paste or http://www.rafb.net/paste/results.html to view recent pastes.
