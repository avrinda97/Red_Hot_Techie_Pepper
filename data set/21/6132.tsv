2007-05-28T12:20:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Redneck|Laptop	I'd try to go with ndiswrapper if you can swing it....it's probably going to work better, but just my opinion
2007-05-28T12:37:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Redneck|Laptop	Actually there is another tutorial, that uses the same technique, that addresses that

2007-05-28T12:46:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Redneck|Laptop	How's that fix working out?
2007-05-28T12:48:00.000Z	Redneck|Laptop	PurpZeY	I dont know anything about compiling things
2007-05-28T12:48:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Redneck|Laptop	Use WifiRadar, skip step 1.
2007-05-28T12:52:00.000Z	Redneck|Laptop	PurpZeY	is there an easy install for wifi radar?
2007-05-28T12:52:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Redneck|Laptop	Just go to Add/Remove
2007-05-28T12:59:00.000Z	Redneck|Laptop	PurpZeY	there is an option that asks for a wpa driver... do you know anything about that?
