2007-10-19T15:32:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	teckfatt	Before or after enabling the restricted driver?
2007-10-19T15:32:00.000Z	teckfatt	ZaphodBeeblebrox	after u disable it it immediately take effect
2007-10-19T15:33:00.000Z	teckfatt	ZaphodBeeblebrox	after enable the driver
2007-10-19T15:33:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	teckfatt	oh i see, sorry, confused things a little bit
2007-10-19T15:34:00.000Z	teckfatt	ZaphodBeeblebrox	you start the x manually with the command # startx and enable it
2007-10-19T15:35:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	teckfatt	ok, just let me check if I understood correctly. I enable the driver, disable GDM and then I start X manually and re-enable it and that's it?

2007-10-19T15:36:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	teckfatt	ok, just let me check if I understood correctly. I enable the driver, disable GDM and then I start X manually and re-enable it and that's it?
