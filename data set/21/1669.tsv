2011-02-20T23:25:00.000Z	MagicJ		how do I make the internal speakers on the computer make a beep.  Clearly it is possible since the system does it when it boots.  I do not want to use the external speakers
2011-02-20T23:26:00.000Z	DasEi	MagicJ	man beep
2011-02-20T23:27:00.000Z	MagicJ	DasEi	- there is no man page for beep on my system
2011-02-20T23:27:00.000Z	DasEi	MagicJ	distro ?
2011-02-20T23:28:00.000Z	MagicJ	DasEi	- running 10.4 - actually let me install beep - I see it is an option
2011-02-20T23:28:00.000Z	DasEi	MagicJ	install then, there you go
2011-02-20T23:31:00.000Z	MagicJ	DasEi	- I have beep now - and according to the man page it would appear that: beep -f 440 -l 250 should play an A for 1/4 a second - I hear nothing - what am I missing
2011-02-20T23:33:00.000Z	MagicJ	DasEi	in fact the man page says "beep" alone should work, but I hear notnhing
2011-02-20T23:35:00.000Z	DasEi	MagicJ	idk, works here, but there was another solution, I can look up in a minute
2011-02-20T23:36:00.000Z	MagicJ	DasEi	: would appreciate that - any guesses as to why the thibg is not working anyway
2011-02-20T23:37:00.000Z	DasEi	MagicJ	sound itself works on the system ?
2011-02-20T23:38:00.000Z	MagicJ	DasEi	- what do you mean - I get regular Ububtu sounds through the external speakers and I get the beep on boot/POST hrough the internal one
2011-02-20T23:39:00.000Z	DasEi	MagicJ	so this isn't the issue
2011-02-20T23:40:00.000Z	MagicJ	DasEi	- so any chance of that other solution
2011-02-20T23:49:00.000Z	MagicJ	DasEi	and others I see comment on the web that I must disable blacklistpcspkr in the modprobe, I see the file: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf, once I edit it how do I apply the edit
2011-02-20T23:52:00.000Z	DasEi	MagicJ	sudo modprobe -v pcspkr
2011-02-20T23:52:00.000Z	DasEi	MagicJ	then try again
2011-02-20T23:55:00.000Z	DasEi	MagicJ	if that all doesn't work, there is softbeep, too , though I don't know which device is pointing to the pcspeaker
2011-02-20T23:58:00.000Z	DasEi	MagicJ	does it beep at you now ?
2011-02-20T23:58:00.000Z	MagicJ	DasEi	that modprobe command worked - thank you so much
2011-02-20T23:59:00.000Z	DasEi	MagicJ	if you want it after next reboot, insert modul in /etc/modules
