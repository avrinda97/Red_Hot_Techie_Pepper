2005-08-12T06:22:00.000Z	apokryphos		is sudo {guiapp} potentially not that devastating in gnome, or something? :|
2005-08-12T06:23:00.000Z	cafuego_	apokryphos	Nope
2005-08-12T06:24:00.000Z	cafuego_	apokryphos	No more harmful than running stuff as root outside of gnome.
2005-08-12T06:25:00.000Z	apokryphos	cafuego_	I doubt it's confined to KDE. sudo {guiapp} can sometimes alter configuration files; sometimes making them root's. Especially with dcop sockets. sudo doesn't set up the environment to run gui apps; that's what gksudo, kdesu are for, surely
2005-08-12T06:25:00.000Z	cafuego_	apokryphos	orbit complains; however it makes its OWN sockets with the username in them.
2005-08-12T06:26:00.000Z	cafuego_	apokryphos	I've had warnings here, but never fatal errors.
2005-08-12T06:27:00.000Z	apokryphos	cafuego_	not fatal; can always be fixed with appropriate chown directory/ -- still, the errors are an issue. Do you still get them with gksudo/kdesu?
2005-08-12T06:28:00.000Z	cafuego_	apokryphos	Never used those except through the admin menus.
2005-08-12T06:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	cafuego_	ubotu doesn't search hoary-extras?
2005-08-12T06:40:00.000Z	cafuego_	apokryphos	well, he should...
2005-09-24T07:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	cafuego_	it's more help these days, really!
2005-09-24T07:11:00.000Z	cafuego_	apokryphos	I can't speak for others ;-)
2005-10-05T15:47:00.000Z	cafuego_	apokryphos	that's not aliased ;-)
2005-10-05T15:47:00.000Z	apokryphos	cafuego_	it doesn't work? That was the process advised some time ago
2005-10-05T15:52:00.000Z	cafuego_	apokryphos	it probably works, I just don't have the command aliases, so it takes longer to type.
2005-10-05T15:52:00.000Z	cafuego_	apokryphos	That said, maybe I should alias it.
2005-10-09T06:02:00.000Z	apokryphos	cafuego_	how very English of you ;-)
2005-10-09T06:03:00.000Z	cafuego_	apokryphos	Yes, I speak english.
2005-10-23T08:06:00.000Z	apokryphos	cafuego_	multiverse
2005-10-23T08:06:00.000Z	cafuego_	apokryphos	Blah ;-)
2006-04-10T16:48:00.000Z	cafuego_	apokryphos	dunno, the log just stopped and blootbot wasn't running. I blame perl.
