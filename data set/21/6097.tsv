2010-06-05T04:11:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	jose	/join ##windows
2010-06-05T04:40:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	jose	do what ubottu said.. and replace ISO-filename with the iso and replace mountpoint with an empty directory
2010-06-05T04:43:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	jose	an empty directory.. create a directory .. for example ~/iso   then use ~/iso as your mountpoint
2010-06-05T04:44:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	jose	 put in the windows cd and install.. that is simple enough.
2010-06-05T04:47:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	jose	you need to create liveCD with that iso then format the partition/drive and leave it blank/unformatted .. then boot into the windows CD and off you go
2010-06-05T04:47:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	jose	use brasero to burn it to a cd
2010-06-05T04:50:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	jose	process what i've just told you. if you follow the directions you will be back installing windows in 15 minutes
2010-06-05T04:52:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	jose	burn the ubuntu iso to a disk using brasero. boot to the liveCD you just created. format the partition/drive and leave it blank or to NTFS ... boot the windows cd and install
2010-06-05T04:56:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	jose	once you get into the liveCD install gparted .. use gparted to format the drive
2010-06-05T05:00:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	jose	be sure to install gparted while booted to the liveCD
