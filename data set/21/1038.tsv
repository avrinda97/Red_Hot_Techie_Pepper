2011-04-30T07:32:00.000Z	Sengoku		can someone help me with wireless
2011-04-30T07:33:00.000Z	NictraSavios	Sengoku	Go to terminal , run "lspci | grep -i network" and paste the results to paste bin
2011-04-30T07:34:00.000Z	Sengoku	NictraSavios	it worked on ubuntu 10
2011-04-30T07:35:00.000Z	NictraSavios	Sengoku	Thats great, But thats not your issue :P Must be a regression. One sec.
2011-04-30T07:36:00.000Z	NictraSavios	Sengoku	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/Broadcom_BCM4311_rev_01_%28ndiswrapper%29
2011-04-30T07:39:00.000Z	NictraSavios	Sengoku	Hmm, too complex? If you want i can help walk you through it.
2011-04-30T07:39:00.000Z	Sengoku	NictraSavios	my Guake is all messed up.. I can't alt-tab :S
2011-04-30T07:40:00.000Z	NictraSavios	Sengoku	Hmm, hate to say it, but yea. 10.10 or LTS will work. If you want my opinion. Unity isnt worth it yet, wait till 12.04 or mabey 11.10.
2011-04-30T07:40:00.000Z	Sengoku	NictraSavios	i'm going back to kde 3.5
2011-04-30T07:41:00.000Z	Sengoku	NictraSavios	so i have to do a full format?
2011-04-30T07:41:00.000Z	NictraSavios	Sengoku	Not a full, i would just format your root , dont worry about your home. (But it may screw things up, so if you want to be 100%, go for it :) )
2011-04-30T07:41:00.000Z	NictraSavios	Sengoku	Unless you have the same / and /home partitions. The yes. Full.
2011-04-30T07:42:00.000Z	Sengoku	NictraSavios	i do :(
2011-04-30T07:42:00.000Z	NictraSavios	Sengoku	Back it up, If you dont have a speical harddrive or partitions for backup, DVD-DL or DVD-R work great. USB Keys break every second month for me. I have disks that have backups from when i was 12.
2011-04-30T07:43:00.000Z	NictraSavios	Sengoku	So USB Backup = 2 months. DVD = 5+ Years.
2011-04-30T07:46:00.000Z	Sengoku	NictraSavios	why is there no alt+tab?
2011-04-30T07:46:00.000Z	NictraSavios	Sengoku	Im pretty sure it was used for somthing else in 11.04.
2011-04-30T07:47:00.000Z	Sengoku	NictraSavios	so how do you juggle between your applications?
2011-04-30T07:47:00.000Z	NictraSavios	Sengoku	On the sidebar youll see dots on the open thingys.
