2007-01-16T07:10:00.000Z	ardchoille42	theflyingfool_	Are you running the gnome desktop?
2007-01-16T07:10:00.000Z	theflyingfool_	ardchoille42	yes
2007-01-16T07:12:00.000Z	ardchoille42	theflyingfool_	Care to pastebin the output of: ps aux | grep gnome-settings-daemon
2007-01-16T07:12:00.000Z	theflyingfool_	ardchoille42	what is the pastebin url
2007-01-16T07:15:00.000Z	ardchoille42	theflyingfool_	Does this command output anything:  which gnome-settings-daemon
2007-01-16T07:15:00.000Z	theflyingfool_	ardchoille42	/usr/bin/gnome-settings-daemon is all it outputs
2007-01-16T07:15:00.000Z	ardchoille42	theflyingfool_	That's good
2007-01-16T07:16:00.000Z	ardchoille42	theflyingfool_	And have you recently installed  new themes or changed to a new theme?
2007-01-16T07:16:00.000Z	theflyingfool_	ardchoille42	i havnt changed themes since install, except on the login page and that works fine
2007-01-16T07:17:00.000Z	ardchoille42	theflyingfool_	Open a terminal and run: gnome-settings-daemon &
2007-01-16T07:17:00.000Z	theflyingfool_	ardchoille42	it seems to have brought back my standard theme,
2007-01-16T07:18:00.000Z	theflyingfool_	ardchoille42	will i have to do this after every login now or should it just work again
2007-01-16T07:18:00.000Z	ardchoille42	theflyingfool_	Ok, I was trying all the common things, it seems that your daemon isn't being executed on login, which you already knew. The problem now is to find out why.
2007-01-16T07:18:00.000Z	theflyingfool_	ardchoille42	any ideas?
2007-01-16T07:19:00.000Z	ardchoille42	theflyingfool_	Until you find out why, you can always add that daemon to the session so it gets run on login. You can add the daemon to the sessions in System -> Preferences -> Sessions  and go to the Startup Programs tab.
2007-01-16T07:20:00.000Z	theflyingfool_	ardchoille42	do i just add that command i just ran?
2007-01-16T07:20:00.000Z	ardchoille42	theflyingfool_	I'm afraid I don't know much about the startup scripts for gnome. Yes, add this to the sessions:  gnome-settings-daemon   (don't add the "&")
2007-01-16T07:20:00.000Z	theflyingfool_	ardchoille42	thanks much
2007-01-16T07:21:00.000Z	ardchoille42	theflyingfool_	You're welcome, you still need to find out *why* it isn't running on login, though
2007-01-16T07:22:00.000Z	theflyingfool_	ardchoille42	a quick fix is all i need to get me though the week though
