2005-12-29T15:12:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Gatorade	what program did you use to burn it?
2005-12-29T15:13:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Gatorade	there's an image burning option with Nero
2005-12-29T15:14:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Gatorade	if you have CD-RW's lying around use those to burn stuff like Live CD's
2005-12-29T15:15:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Gatorade	yeah, I've been a user of Windows for 10 years. I switched to Linux not 5 days ago.. after I figured it out I like it so much better

2005-12-29T15:17:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Gatorade	whatcha mean?
2005-12-29T15:18:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Gatorade	oh, no.. there should be an Image-burning option.
2005-12-29T15:18:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Gatorade	load Nero Express
2005-12-29T15:18:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Gatorade	yep that's the one =)
