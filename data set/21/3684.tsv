2008-12-10T07:41:00.000Z	fushorts	l7	system > preferences > sessions
2008-12-10T07:42:00.000Z	l7	fushorts	thanks, i'm trying that
2008-12-10T07:45:00.000Z	fushorts	l7	that should save automagically
2008-12-10T07:47:00.000Z	fushorts	l7	i know if you have advanced desktop settings it is possible for the most part
2008-12-10T07:47:00.000Z	fushorts	l7	you can get that from add/remove programs if you dont have it already
2008-12-10T07:50:00.000Z	l7	fushorts	hmm, i'm searching for it...
2008-12-10T07:52:00.000Z	l7	fushorts	did you mean simple-ccsm?
2008-12-10T07:52:00.000Z	fushorts	l7	up top you need to make sure you have it set to all available applications, then it is called Advanced Desktop Effects Settings (ccsm)
2008-12-10T07:53:00.000Z	l7	fushorts	you mean make sure there's a check mark next to all the third party software repos?
2008-12-10T07:55:00.000Z	fushorts	l7	on mine it is just a selection on the top that says All available applications
2008-12-10T07:56:00.000Z	l7	fushorts	http://phubuntu.wordpress.com/2007/10/19/advanced-desktop-effects-settings/ seems to suggest the package is compizconfig-settings-manager
2008-12-10T07:56:00.000Z	l7	fushorts	is that the package you're referring to?
2008-12-10T07:58:00.000Z	fushorts	l7	yeah
2008-12-10T07:59:00.000Z	fushorts	l7	after it is installed on mine it turns to the compiz name however in the Add/Remove programs list it was the advanced desktop settings name
2008-12-10T07:59:00.000Z	l7	fushorts	which version of ubuntu do you have by the way?
2008-12-10T08:00:00.000Z	fushorts	l7	8.10 currently but it has been that way fro me since 7.04 i believe
2008-12-10T08:03:00.000Z	l7	fushorts	ah well thanks for the tip, switching the placement mode to cascade in compizconfig is a bit nicer
2008-12-10T08:03:00.000Z	fushorts	l7	sorry i cant be of more help good luck
2008-12-10T08:04:00.000Z	l7	fushorts	 it's cool, cascaded windows is a bit of an improvement for not too much work
2008-12-10T08:05:00.000Z	fushorts	l7	fair enough :)
