2006-09-12T11:11:00.000Z	noobie0057		Hi I'm using Gnome,, it is possible to have a different CPU for each desktop?
2006-09-12T11:13:00.000Z	noobie0057		can each desktop in gnome have a different CPU ?
2006-09-12T11:14:00.000Z	sethk	noobie0057	no
2006-09-12T11:14:00.000Z	sethk	noobie0057	well, not without patching the kernel, which I've done but is not trivial
2006-09-12T11:14:00.000Z	sethk	noobie0057	so effectively, no.
2006-09-12T11:15:00.000Z	sethk	noobie0057	no, I've done it at work.  I haven't found a project.  want to start one?
2006-09-12T11:15:00.000Z	noobie0057	sethk	sounds pretty good, if I could just share a hard drive and a monitor, copy and paste...
2006-09-12T11:16:00.000Z	sethk	noobie0057	the reason I've done it is to get more throughput in a router.  patches like that are very difficult to port forward as new kernels are released.
2006-09-12T11:17:00.000Z	noobie0057	sethk	thanks for the info, I'm still very new to linux, I was hoping that it was a matter of right clicking something. If a project did exist on it I would join it
2006-11-19T07:09:00.000Z	sethk	noobie0057	you are running into one of the problems with ubuntu's setup.  you have to boot the live cd to get around it.
2006-11-19T07:10:00.000Z	noobie0057	sethk	do you know what I should do? boot on the cd then edit the hosts file?
2006-11-19T07:10:00.000Z	sethk	noobie0057	yes
2006-11-19T07:11:00.000Z	noobie0057	sethk	I'm a newbie,, how do I access the correct hosts file,, I think if I tried I might not know how to mount the harddrive
2006-11-19T07:12:00.000Z	sethk	noobie0057	that depends on your partition layout and such.  do you know which partition is your linux root file system?
2006-11-19T07:12:00.000Z	noobie0057	sethk	I just have a swap and then everything else
2006-11-19T07:13:00.000Z	sethk	noobie0057	and the entire drive is linux?  probably you'll need to mount /dev/hda1.   you can do this:   fdisk -l /dev/hda   which will list the partitions on hda
2006-11-19T07:14:00.000Z	sethk	noobie0057	hda assumes that you are using IDE drives and the partitions are on primary master.
2006-11-19T07:15:00.000Z	noobie0057	sethk	yes primary master,, I think that is how I set it up,, maybe I  should just try it?
2006-11-19T07:15:00.000Z	sethk	noobie0057	sure, why not?
2006-11-19T07:15:00.000Z	sethk	noobie0057	if fdisk -l /dev/hda doesn't do what you expect, then you'll know it isn't ide primary master.  :)
2006-11-19T07:15:00.000Z	noobie0057	sethk	thanks
