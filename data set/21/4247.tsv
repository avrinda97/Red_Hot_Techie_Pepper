2008-06-05T19:16:00.000Z	slyf		Hey, for some reason my menu.lst, no matter what changes i do to it, they dont show up in grub, I even changed the friggin initrd to something random, and it didnt change it in grub, I ran update-grub, it changed a couple things in my menu.lst, but my grub is still loading an old menu.lst, and I have no idea where its coming from, I even ran find|grep menu.lst, and didnt find any other ones

2008-06-05T19:19:00.000Z	slyf	Jack_Sparrow	In grub, kernel 24-18 doesnt show up, and 24-17 is still loading /boot/newinit2 (My custom initrd)
2008-06-05T19:19:00.000Z	slyf	Jack_Sparrow	Whops, nvm about newinit2
2008-06-05T19:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	slyf	do you get 7 options when you boot your grub.. do you have anyother linux installs on your system?
2008-06-05T19:22:00.000Z	slyf	Jack_Sparrow	Nope, this is my only "Linux" I have installed, and yes, I get 7
2008-06-05T19:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	slyf	Clearly the -18 kernel is in your list
2008-06-05T19:23:00.000Z	slyf	Jack_Sparrow	Yes, but in grub, it doesnt show up
2008-06-05T19:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	slyf	does the tile of the first one show 18
2008-06-05T19:23:00.000Z	slyf	Jack_Sparrow	Nope
2008-06-05T19:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	slyf	do you get 7 options when you boot your grub
2008-06-05T19:24:00.000Z	slyf	Jack_Sparrow	Yes, I get the two Windows, Memtest, -16 recovery, -16, -17 recovery, and -17
2008-06-05T19:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	slyf	try adding a blank line above the entry for -18
2008-06-05T19:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	slyf	that should not have an effect.. but stranger things have happened
2008-06-05T19:26:00.000Z	slyf	Jack_Sparrow	kk, rebooting to test
2008-06-05T19:30:00.000Z	slyf	Jack_Sparrow	Yup, doesnt show up
2008-06-05T19:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	slyf	    I know it dint work...  look at title in your -18 kernel.. notice CAP T and not lower case t.. sorry, I didnt see that until you logged out
2008-06-05T19:30:00.000Z	slyf	Jack_Sparrow	K
2008-06-05T19:35:00.000Z	slyf	Jack_Sparrow	Thanks, it worked
