2008-12-02T04:29:00.000Z	nDuff	NeedHelpx	you didn't ask a question
2008-12-02T04:30:00.000Z	NeedHelpx	nDuff	asked it more than three times allready
2008-12-02T04:30:00.000Z	nDuff	NeedHelpx	you asked "can someone help me with networking?" -- that isn't asking a networking question, that's asking to ask.
2008-12-02T04:30:00.000Z	NeedHelpx		nduff read way higher
2008-12-02T04:31:00.000Z	NeedHelpx		joined twice to get some attention
2008-12-02T04:31:00.000Z	nDuff	NeedHelpx	oh -- DNS resolution isn't working for you?
2008-12-02T04:31:00.000Z	nDuff	NeedHelpx	does /etc/resolv.conf look right?
2008-12-02T04:31:00.000Z	NeedHelpx		nduff yup
2008-12-02T04:31:00.000Z	NeedHelpx		worked before .. chanegd no setting and now can't resolv any hostname
2008-12-02T04:32:00.000Z	nDuff	NeedHelpx	it may have worked before, but it also might have been messed up by a misbehaving DHCP client or such. Manually verify the file's contents, please.
2008-12-02T04:33:00.000Z	nDuff	NeedHelpx	also, see if you can ping the DNS server identified in /etc/resolv.conf (by IP).
