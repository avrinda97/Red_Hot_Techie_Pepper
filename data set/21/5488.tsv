2007-10-12T11:24:00.000Z	Snuxoll	Gun_Smoke	If you want to backup to a 160, might as well make a cron job that cp -r's a directory to the drive
2007-10-12T11:26:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	Snuxoll	Interested in the cron but more less looking into playing with some for of RAID as a learing tool.
2007-10-12T11:26:00.000Z	Snuxoll	Gun_Smoke	If you wanted a RAID, you'll want two internal disks
