2011-12-22T13:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	jubei	 it depends on your needs and how you will use vnc also
2011-12-22T13:23:00.000Z	jubei	dr_willis	I just want to see my desktop and click around, nothing fancy like file transfers etc
2011-12-22T13:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	jubei	 over local lan? you mean current visible desktop? or hidden remote desktop...
2011-12-22T13:25:00.000Z	jubei	dr_willis	currently logged-in desktop, over the internet, no hidden stuff
2011-12-22T13:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	jubei	 try teamviewer
2011-12-22T13:25:00.000Z	jubei	dr_willis	kk, thanks.
2011-12-22T13:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	jubei	 ive had issues with it i the past also.
2011-12-22T13:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	jubei	 depeding on what you are doing, you could just use ssh and x forwarding
2012-01-10T23:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	jubei	 you mean mount 2 filesystems?  to one mountpoint?
2012-01-10T23:59:00.000Z	jubei	dr_willis	like.. merging 2 disks to one partition
2012-01-10T23:59:00.000Z	jubei	dr_willis	I have 2 clean disks and I want to make one partition out of them
2012-01-11T00:00:00.000Z	jubei	dr_willis	thanks
2012-01-11T00:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	jubei	 you really have a major need for a single mountpoint with the capacity of both disks?
2012-01-11T00:00:00.000Z	jubei	dr_willis	yes
2012-01-11T00:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	jubei	 be sure to have backups. :)
2012-01-11T00:03:00.000Z	jubei	dr_willis	is there some gnome guy tool to do this? because none of the links you sent me were helpful
2012-01-11T00:03:00.000Z	jubei	dr_willis	the guides you sent me explain how to install to softwareraid/fakeraid I just want to make it out of 2 independent disks
2012-01-11T00:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	jubei	 i dont use the feature. so the guides url is all i know on the topic.
2012-01-11T00:04:00.000Z	jubei	dr_willis	ic. thanks anyway
2012-01-11T00:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	jubei	 ive learned from hanging in here. that often raids are more trouble then they are worth
2012-01-11T00:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	jubei	 wht you described sounded like a fake raid to me.
