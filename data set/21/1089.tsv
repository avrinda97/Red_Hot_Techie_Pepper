2011-02-05T11:24:00.000Z	xgt001		ok... :) any ideas about connecting nokia 6600 via bluetooth to Ubuntu 10.10 /10.04 for net connection????
2011-02-05T11:26:00.000Z	xgt001		i agree with bazhang ... will break lots of packages....
2011-02-05T11:26:00.000Z	xgt001		actionparsnip: i tried it ... doesnt work :(
2011-02-05T11:28:00.000Z	xgt001		the basic problem is... 10.10 cant access my cellphone's bluetooth services ....(even file sharing) ....
2011-02-05T11:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	xgt001	might it just be in the kernel of 11.04?  you should be able to backport that
2011-02-05T11:30:00.000Z	xgt001	sacarlson	ya .... if thats the case then i dont think nothing much can be done :(
2011-02-05T11:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	xgt001	why did you already boot the 11.04 kernel in 10.10 and fail?
2011-02-05T11:32:00.000Z	xgt001	sacarlson	nonono i was using 10.10 b4.... bt then formatted it and installed 11.04 (only for testing)... and i noticed that bluetooth works so dint remove it
2011-02-05T11:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	xgt001	so make a dualboot system with 10.10 and 11.04 and try backport the 11.04 kernel then,  if not boot the one that has the feature you need at the moment
2011-02-05T11:35:00.000Z	xgt001	sacarlson	11.04 has a sad grub as of now.... it wont install with the normal installation... it shows error ... so no 10.04 dual boot :(
2011-02-05T11:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	xgt001	you don't need to change grub to boot the 11.04 kernel,  keep 10.04 grub and try just port the kernel
2011-02-05T11:37:00.000Z	xgt001	sacarlson	can u explain how to port the kernel???
2011-02-05T11:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	xgt001	you said you already have 11.04 installed,   you just need to setup a spare 6 gig partition to install the secound
2011-02-05T11:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	xgt001	to port the kernel just get the deb file for it and install it in 10.04 or just copy the two files that make up a kernel and put them into /boot and create a custom grub2 entry to boot that set of ported kernel to try
2011-02-05T11:40:00.000Z	xgt001	sacarlson	ok the simple deb install should work???
2011-02-05T11:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	xgt001	I'm not sure if the kernel is you problem or not but it's one difference between that it could be,  what version kernel is your 11.04 now running?
2011-02-05T11:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	xgt001	I see kernel 2.6.38 available in daily build ppa you could try on both 11.04 and 10.10 https://launchpad.net/~kernel-ppa/+archive/ppa?field.series_filter=lucid
2011-02-05T11:47:00.000Z	xgt001	sacarlson	is it a deb file???
2011-02-05T11:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	xgt001	it an added repository that adds deb files yes
2011-02-05T11:48:00.000Z	xgt001	sacarlson	will give it a shot :) thanks
2011-03-26T14:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	xgt001	I found that there is a utility to check acpi  called powertop  sudo apt-get powertop http://www.lesswatts.org/projects/powertop/
