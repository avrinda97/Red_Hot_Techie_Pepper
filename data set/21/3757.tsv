2008-09-29T07:23:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ketchupz57	did you see my comment?
2008-09-29T07:26:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ketchupz57	Read my previous comment!

2008-09-29T07:30:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ketchupz57	It sounds as if the configure script expects otherwise :)
2008-09-29T07:30:00.000Z	ketchupz57	IntuitiveNipple	if it doesn't what would you suggest I need?
2008-09-29T07:31:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ketchupz57	You'd have to examine the configure script to see what it checks for. As dennisWang said earlier, try "./configure --help"
2008-09-29T07:33:00.000Z	ketchupz57	IntuitiveNipple	http://wiki.awn-project.org/InstallingFromSource#AWN_From_Source That is the source that is leading me on this install. Per what I have found from what I've looked at and read Ubuntu 8.04 LTS has the latest compents required.
2008-09-29T07:33:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ketchupz57	Are you building on Hardy?
2008-09-29T07:35:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ketchupz57	"Dependencies: There are a number of header/library packages needed to compile/install Awn" - the headers are likely what you have to sort out
2008-09-29T07:37:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ketchupz57	Did you get the source from the bazaar VCS, or use the tar-ball ?
2008-09-29T07:38:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ketchupz57	Did you check that you have all the dependencies installed? They do provide a handy table: http://wiki.awn-project.org/Dependency_Matrix
2008-09-29T07:40:00.000Z	ketchupz57	IntuitiveNipple	any idea if I can just make a applet for the trash can manually? I'm feeling this isn't going to be worth while to compile this tonight. If I can't work around this I will likely continue compiling tomorrow.
2008-09-29T07:41:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ketchupz57	The best way to do that is copy the source of one of the simple applets in gnome-applets and adjust it to suit
2008-09-29T07:41:00.000Z	ketchupz57	IntuitiveNipple	link me?
2008-09-29T07:44:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ketchupz57	How about trying this. Change to a clean fresh directory. Do "sudo apt-get install bzr". when that is done, do "bzr co lp:awn awn", then do "cd awn". then do "sudo apt-get build-dep avant-window-navigator", then build it using "fakeroot debian/rules binary"
2008-09-29T07:45:00.000Z	ketchupz57	IntuitiveNipple	before doing that maybe tell me how to copy a trash can applet command so i can just manually add it to AWN?
2008-09-29T07:46:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ketchupz57	I have no idea what you mean by "a trash can applet command"
2008-09-29T07:47:00.000Z	ketchupz57	IntuitiveNipple	In AWN i can manually add a launcher or an applet. The trash can is simply an applet. If I can browse to where the applet actually exist, I can manually add it to AWN. The other alternative is running a command. If you tell me how to open the gui trashcan at cmd then I can add it manually to AWN that way.
2008-09-29T07:50:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ketchupz57	I'm not sure where the trash applet lives
2008-09-29T07:52:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ketchupz57	If you can add applets by their ID, it is "OAFIID:GNOME_Panel_TrashApplet"
