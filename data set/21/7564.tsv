2008-08-19T13:03:00.000Z	skoenman		hallo can someone please tell me im triing to compile clamav and i need a compiler wich one should i use???
2008-08-19T13:03:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	you don't need to compailed it
2008-08-19T13:03:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	if you open your package manager and search for clam you'll find it in there, pre-compiled ready for use
2008-08-19T13:04:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	I assure you, you don't need to compile it
2008-08-19T13:05:00.000Z	skoenman	ikonia	have you setup a clamav server with safesquid???
2008-08-19T13:07:00.000Z	skoenman	ikonia	what compiler do you think i should load???i have loaded gcc
2008-08-19T13:07:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	well, the documents I've just read on it, say nothing about needing to compile it
2008-08-19T13:08:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	safe-squid just needs to access the pre-compiled clam daemon - you do not need to compile it
2008-08-19T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	what makes you say that ?
2008-08-19T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	I suspect its something stupid like the safe-squid user hasn't got the correct permissions to the clam socket file
2008-08-19T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	why do you think it's the version ?
2008-08-19T13:10:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	I've just read 3 documents (skimmed I'll grant you) and none of them require you to compile clam to work
2008-08-19T13:11:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	so ?
2008-08-19T13:11:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	don't just blindly do things
2008-08-19T13:11:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	investigate
2008-08-19T13:11:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	what is the error your getting ? why do you think it's a version issue (whats your clue)
2008-08-19T13:12:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	I'm still waiting for some sort of debug info or something that gives you a clue that it's a clam av version issue
2008-08-19T13:13:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	no - that means safe-squid and clamav are not talking to either other....thats all
2008-08-19T13:13:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	well, as I said look into it, check the log files, check why they can't talk, then fix it
2008-08-19T13:13:00.000Z	ikonia	skoenman	rather than blindly assuming things and doing things
2008-08-19T13:44:00.000Z	skoenman	ikonia	i dont know what i did now but it works with precompiled files and the same squid....
