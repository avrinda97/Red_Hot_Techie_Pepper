2005-07-09T08:46:00.000Z	zdogde		i have a problem
2005-07-09T08:47:00.000Z	zdogde		i downloaded the latest ubuntu daily install cd but everytime the installer says that no kernel modules were found on the cd and perhabs the installer version is different from the version i want to install and so on...
2005-07-09T08:47:00.000Z	zdogde		no penis works
2005-07-09T08:48:00.000Z	zdogde		any idea why the daily install cd AND live cd do not work?
2005-07-09T08:49:00.000Z	zdogde		its weird but the live cd always starts the installer and says exactly the same as the install cd...
2005-07-09T08:49:00.000Z	butulin	zdogde	have confirmed ur downloade file? is it consistent?
2005-07-09T08:49:00.000Z	zdogde		its consistent...
2005-07-09T08:50:00.000Z	butulin		no burning probs?...
2005-07-09T08:50:00.000Z	zdogde		i wonder if the developers forget to include the kernel modules?
2005-07-09T08:50:00.000Z	zdogde		no probs

2005-07-09T08:51:00.000Z	butulin	zdogde	i downloaded one copy and it worked alright for me...
2005-07-09T08:51:00.000Z	butulin		why don't u order some CDs?
2005-07-09T08:53:00.000Z	zdogde		mhh so what am i doing wrong? i download it , burn it and then boot from it, the boot splash appears i press enter the installers loads up and checks my hardware then it says no kernel modules found... just like this message on this website (seems to be a debian problem not ubuntu)
