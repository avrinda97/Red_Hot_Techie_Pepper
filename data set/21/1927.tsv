2010-04-20T04:35:00.000Z	tm0		Hey everyone, can someone help me figure out how to get my external drive working on linux?
2010-04-20T04:35:00.000Z	maginot	tm0	is an USB drive?
2010-04-20T04:35:00.000Z	tm0	maginot	yes it is.
2010-04-20T04:36:00.000Z	maginot	tm0	when you plug it what is the last messages dmesg shows you? Pastebin, please
2010-04-20T04:37:00.000Z	tm0	maginot	well thats not the problem. If i turn off and on it shows. I just can't mount it in natulis :(
2010-04-20T04:38:00.000Z	maginot	tm0	if you turn off and on, what do you mean... it mounts or do not mount? Where it is showing when you turn on and off? Can you pastebin the output of dmesg?
2010-04-20T04:39:00.000Z	tm0	maginot	it poops with a windows and a random folder name containing all my files
2010-04-20T04:39:00.000Z	maginot	tm0	okay, so nautilus is showing the disk... where is the problem, don`t get it so far
2010-04-20T04:40:00.000Z	tm0	maginot	if i boot with it, i get nothing. Cololessprism the name is "C4686E88686E7956"
2010-04-20T04:40:00.000Z	maginot	tm0	I think you should remake your question, I think you want that your drive automatically mount always on some folder
2010-04-20T04:40:00.000Z	tm0	maginot	i want it to at lesat show up in places. I can make it startup with a shell script from there then at least
2010-04-20T04:41:00.000Z	maginot	tm0	okay, so when you click on Computer you can't access your disk from there
2010-04-20T04:41:00.000Z	tm0	maginot	not from start up.
2010-04-20T04:43:00.000Z	maginot	tm0	okay. Pastebin output of Dmesg AND output of "udevadm monitor" after you plug the drive (start udevadm with that command and plug the drive)

2010-04-20T04:48:00.000Z	maginot	tm0	well, I can't see any thing about dmesg, which I asked you some times already, but udev shows everything is fine, did you have any gvfs message on your logs ?
2010-04-20T04:50:00.000Z	tm0	maginot	i added it under the udev. I just didn't copy the command. It was too large to post it all. Also none.
2010-04-20T04:50:00.000Z	tm0	maginot	should i just accept its a limitation at the moment?
2010-04-20T04:50:00.000Z	maginot	tm0	well, you really should take a look at your logs on /var/logs
2010-04-20T04:51:00.000Z	maginot	tm0	if you are having a problem with devices not being shown on Computer so it is probably a gvfs or polkit problem, I could tell you that is a gconf problem, but that is more probable when you change something manually
2010-04-20T04:52:00.000Z	tm0	maginot	thanks for your help very much. I'll look into those. Was just hoping to have some exam music. Thank you anyways
