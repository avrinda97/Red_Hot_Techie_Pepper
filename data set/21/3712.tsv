2009-02-06T02:27:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK		damn.. first real problem in 2 month of ubuntu 8.10 (for me atleast;) I logged windows XP to check some stuff.. when I logged back onto ubuntu I was unable to go to my shared drive.. "you are not privileged to mount the volume 'HUUUGE'" ( HUUUGE being my shared device) anyone knows what might be wrong? :O
2009-02-06T02:29:00.000Z	Jeruvy	GaMbi_DK	what can you tell us about your permissions?
2009-02-06T02:29:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Jeruvy	ben able to go to any of my paritisions right from the start.. I got root
2009-02-06T02:30:00.000Z	Jeruvy	GaMbi_DK	how are you authenticating?  Guest or user permissions?
2009-02-06T02:31:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Jeruvy	user I guess.. my own private computer..
2009-02-06T02:32:00.000Z	Jeruvy	GaMbi_DK	I need you to check or know.  If you don't I cannot troubleshoot (it doesn't work).
2009-02-06T02:32:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Jeruvy	never thought about auth since I never had any problems with access for anything at all.. where do I check?
2009-02-06T02:34:00.000Z	Jeruvy	GaMbi_DK	you can check the /etc/samba/smb.conf for configuration details
2009-02-06T02:38:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Jeruvy	thats nice.. I dont know what half of the lines in smb.conf means :) anyways.. the ones that matters looks fine.. but guess I will try on forums
2009-02-06T02:38:00.000Z	Jeruvy	GaMbi_DK	use the how-to's ubottu point at for good directions for setting up samba.
2009-02-06T02:39:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Jeruvy	I will look that up.. thx for your time :)
2009-02-06T03:07:00.000Z	Jeruvy	GaMbi_DK	I would assume it should but check and test :)
2009-02-06T02:46:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Jeruvy	It seams that ppl think that if windows crashes and I then boot onto ubuntu.. that might cause the problem.. that is what happend to me tbh :) so gonna try a reboot.. wish me luck ^^
2009-02-06T02:51:00.000Z	Jeruvy	GaMbi_DK	can you show us the errors?  if they won't fit in a line use the pastebin (see topic, or ask ubottu about !pastebin)
2009-02-06T02:52:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Jeruvy	just found a long error message.. but dont wanna post it.. what is the page for stuff like that? "past.ubuntu.org" or something like that right?
2009-02-06T02:54:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Jeruvy	 and IntuitiveNipple yea Im using NTFS-3g (I think)
2009-02-06T02:55:00.000Z	Jeruvy	GaMbi_DK	I'll let you find someone who's familiar with ntfs-3g for help.  I won't be much :)
2009-02-06T02:56:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Jeruvy	okay :)
2009-02-06T03:05:00.000Z	Jeruvy	GaMbi_DK	most devices in /media are 'removable' so they may dismount on a reboot
2009-02-06T03:10:00.000Z	Jeruvy	GaMbi_DK	you did all the work :)
2009-02-06T03:12:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Jeruvy	not much work ey? ;) IntuitiveNipple yea.. so did I when ubuntu startet up without background and no media working :) good thing it wasn't cause I need my sleep now :) cya later! and once again thx
