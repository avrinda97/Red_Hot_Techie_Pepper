2008-07-07T05:09:00.000Z	MarieK		Hello! im very new to Ubuntu, i want to connect my external HFS drive to my computer, but it dosent work. I read about kernels that maybe my kernel dosent support HFS filesystem. How do i check that?
2008-07-07T05:10:00.000Z	xipietotec	MarieK	what kernel are you using
2008-07-07T05:11:00.000Z	MarieK	xipietotec	2.6.24
2008-07-07T05:12:00.000Z	xipietotec		!hsf+
2008-07-07T05:12:00.000Z	xipietotec		!hsf
2008-07-07T05:12:00.000Z	xipietotec		I thought hsf+ was recognized by default...
2008-07-07T05:12:00.000Z	MarieK	xipietotec	i can see my drivers, but not mount them..
2008-07-07T05:12:00.000Z	xipietotec	MarieK	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2008-07-07T05:13:00.000Z	MarieK	xipietotec	ohh, its xubuntu..
2008-07-07T05:13:00.000Z	xipietotec	MarieK	ah, I'm not sure that xubuntu has an automounting tool like in gnome
2008-07-07T05:14:00.000Z	xipietotec		you might have to edit your fstab
2008-07-07T05:14:00.000Z	MarieK	xipietotec	its so irritating.. because its my sons problem.. he want to connect this drive to his ps3
2008-07-07T05:15:00.000Z	MarieK	xipietotec	he installed this "custom" kernel so he can use wifi.
2008-07-07T05:15:00.000Z	xipietotec	MarieK	I'd ask in #xubuntu I'm not very familiar with xubuntu's user space tools. If the kernel is customized, he may not have the drivers in it.
2008-07-07T05:16:00.000Z	MarieK	xipietotec	ok. but is it possible to install ubuntu over xubuntu?
2008-07-07T05:16:00.000Z	xipietotec	MarieK	Yes, it's possible to install normal ubuntu through synaptic
2008-07-07T05:16:00.000Z	MarieK	xipietotec	without ereasing the kernel?
2008-07-07T05:16:00.000Z	xipietotec	MarieK	yes, kernels are a separate issue to user tools
2008-07-07T05:17:00.000Z	xipietotec		gnome / xfce / kde are userspace
2008-07-07T05:17:00.000Z	xipietotec		nothing to do with the kernel
2008-07-07T05:17:00.000Z	MarieK	xipietotec	ok! i try that. thanks everybody! Hope i dont need to get here again. ;)
