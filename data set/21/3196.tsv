2009-03-05T20:32:00.000Z	dajxd1		I've just installed ubuntu yesterday and cannot get any videos to play in VLC or movie player- the application just closes.  Any ideas?
2009-03-05T20:32:00.000Z	Cycom	dajxd1	ATI video card?
2009-03-05T20:32:00.000Z	dajxd1	Cycom	Yes, it is.
2009-03-05T20:32:00.000Z	Cycom	dajxd1	running compi?
2009-03-05T20:33:00.000Z	dajxd1	Cycom	I don't believe so.
2009-03-05T20:33:00.000Z	Cycom	dajxd1	do your menus do neat things like fade?
2009-03-05T20:33:00.000Z	dajxd1	Cycom	yyep,  Guess I am then?
2009-03-05T20:33:00.000Z	Cycom	dajxd1	indeed you are.
2009-03-05T20:34:00.000Z	Cycom	dajxd1	here's the deal: there's an issue with the default ATI setup and video playback.  the good news is that there is a really easy fix.
2009-03-05T20:34:00.000Z	dajxd1	Cycom	Sounds good to me- should I browse around for a fix or is it easy for you to relate it here?
2009-03-05T20:35:00.000Z	Cycom	dajxd1	I was googling it up to make sure :)
2009-03-05T20:35:00.000Z	Cycom	dajxd1	know what Xorg.conf is?
2009-03-05T20:35:00.000Z	dajxd1	Cycom	barely, but yes.
2009-03-05T20:36:00.000Z	dajxd1	Cycom	I've got it open now
2009-03-05T20:36:00.000Z	Cycom	dajxd1	ok, what you need to do is add the line Option "AccelMethod" "EXA" as shown https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/269357 < here
2009-03-05T20:36:00.000Z	dajxd1	Cycom	beautiful, thank you
2009-03-05T20:36:00.000Z	Cycom	dajxd1	once that's done, restart X, and watch your videos :)
2009-03-05T20:41:00.000Z	dajxd1	Cycom	I'm sorry- where in this file do I add the line?  In a new section?
2009-03-05T20:42:00.000Z	Cycom	dajxd1	no no, under the Identifier "Configured Video Device"
2009-03-05T20:42:00.000Z	dajxd1	Cycom	I have Section "Device", should I use that or make a new one?
2009-03-05T20:43:00.000Z	Cycom	dajxd1	use that one.
