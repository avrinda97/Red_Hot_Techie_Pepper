2012-08-20T08:19:00.000Z	Nautilus		nitorb: no "Places" there.  BTW I'm on 10.04 (basically wanting to check my backup on sdb2 before upgrading)
2012-08-20T08:21:00.000Z	Nautilus		i wouldnt mind a scratch install but then theres so much to redo
2012-08-20T08:23:00.000Z	Nautilus		i have used Clonezilla to grab the entire partition as a backup
2012-08-20T08:23:00.000Z	Nautilus		did you have vhosts? mysql db's?
2012-08-20T08:25:00.000Z	Nautilus		just a local web dev box
2012-08-20T08:26:00.000Z	Nautilus		i don't mean specifically an upgrade. A scratch install is OK so long as I have backed up what I need
2012-08-20T08:27:00.000Z	Nautilus		i'm trying to "move" from 10.04 -> 12.04, unless it's not worth it
2012-08-20T08:28:00.000Z	histo	Nautilus	there are no issues upgrading from LTS to LTS is supported
2012-08-20T08:28:00.000Z	Nautilus	histo	w/o 12.04.1?
2012-08-20T08:28:00.000Z	histo	Nautilus	it's suggested to wait untill 12.04.1
2012-08-20T08:31:00.000Z	histo	Nautilus	yes clonezilla you can clone your drive.  or you can just tar up your home would be sufficient backup
2012-08-20T08:32:00.000Z	histo	Nautilus	oh if you have a server then no
2012-08-20T08:32:00.000Z	histo	Nautilus	just bootup a clonezilla livecd and image the drive to a removable drive
2012-08-20T08:33:00.000Z	histo	Nautilus	then you have nothing to worry about unless your image is bad
2012-08-20T08:33:00.000Z	histo	Nautilus	is there a reason you need to upgrade at this minute?
2012-08-20T08:33:00.000Z	Nautilus	histo	not really
2012-08-20T08:33:00.000Z	histo	Nautilus	all my servers are still running 10.04
2012-08-20T08:34:00.000Z	histo	Nautilus	As others have stated with the issues people experience. I just wait on my servers untill LTS .1
2012-08-20T08:34:00.000Z	histo	Nautilus	then others have debugged any issues I may experience
2012-08-20T08:36:00.000Z	histo	Nautilus	if you have a backup though what's there to lose I guess. It's up to you.
2012-08-20T08:37:00.000Z	histo	Nautilus	you're not going to see anything earth shatering from upgrading to 12.04
