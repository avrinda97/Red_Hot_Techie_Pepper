2006-05-16T05:32:00.000Z	carl		Hmm
2006-05-16T05:32:00.000Z	carl		How do I set up a WiFi connection on boot? i mean with a WEP key and the name of the AP?
2006-05-16T05:34:00.000Z	minimec	carl	all that stuff is configured in the /etc/network/interfaces file. Take a look on man ifup or man idown
2006-05-16T05:36:00.000Z	minimec	carl	use the iwconfig commands for that. you can also configure them in the 'interface'-file
2006-05-16T05:37:00.000Z	carl	minimec	exactly, as of now I created a file of my own that runs the iwconfig commands I need... but what to add to 'interfaces'
2006-05-16T05:37:00.000Z	minimec	carl	mom
2006-05-16T05:39:00.000Z	minimec	carl	You can use all the iwconfig commands (as far as I know). I never had some problems with that.
2006-05-16T05:39:00.000Z	carl	minimec	you mean just add them to the interfaces file?
2006-05-16T05:40:00.000Z	minimec	carl	Yes. Exactly
2006-05-16T05:41:00.000Z	carl	minimec	?
2006-05-16T05:42:00.000Z	minimec	carl	no... wireless-key yourkey
2006-05-16T05:42:00.000Z	minimec	carl	no... wireless-key yourkey [1]  Like that...
2006-05-16T05:44:00.000Z	minimec	carl	the [1]  could be important, because you have to tell the system with of the 4 keys you are using.
2006-05-16T05:45:00.000Z	carl	minimec	ok... would this work as well then?         wireless-essid SpeedTouch13F463
2006-05-16T05:45:00.000Z	carl	minimec	and this. wireless-ap 00:10:C6:28:03:11  ?
2006-05-16T05:45:00.000Z	minimec	carl	if you use a key in plain text you have to add a 's:' like wireless-key s:mykey [1] 
2006-05-16T05:46:00.000Z	carl	minimec	ok but the wireless-ap and wireless-essid will work as well?
2006-05-16T05:47:00.000Z	minimec	carl	never tried... Have a look at man ifup or man ifdown or /usr/share/doc/ifup...
2006-05-16T05:48:00.000Z	carl	minimec	doesn't really say :/
2006-05-16T05:49:00.000Z	carl	minimec	I will give it a shot, thanks for your help man
2006-05-16T05:49:00.000Z	minimec	carl	'man ifup', 'man interfaces' and 'man iwconfig' is all you need. It's all there ;)
