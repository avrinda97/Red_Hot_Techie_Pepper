2010-08-04T15:10:00.000Z	nando		Hi my system take to much time to boot, this happens when I install my graphics card driver.
2010-08-04T15:10:00.000Z	nando		Can anybody help me?
2010-08-04T15:10:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	nVidia? ATI? Intel...?
2010-08-04T15:11:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	And how many is "too much"
2010-08-04T15:13:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	And before installing worked fine?
2010-08-04T15:14:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	And what appear in screen while your PC "waits" to boot?
2010-08-04T15:16:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	That happens me too, but only for a second, then works fine; anyways it's after booting, that happens while loading nvidia driver
2010-08-04T15:16:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	Your nvidia is gForce 5* FX, isn't it?
2010-08-04T15:17:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	Model?
2010-08-04T15:18:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	Did you try reinstalling drivers?
2010-08-04T15:19:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	And unistalling completty and trying to reboot if problem continues?
2010-08-04T15:21:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	Well, let's try a thing
2010-08-04T15:21:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	When you are going to install driver from ubuntu, there are 2 versions, right?
2010-08-04T15:22:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	Try installing the older version, and try rebooting, maybe with that works fine
2010-08-04T15:22:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	Yes, I know, but it fails for you, right? Then try the other one
2010-08-04T15:23:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	No, is for that model too, but it's an older driver
2010-08-04T15:23:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	What do you prefer? Trying a older driver or using new one which fails?
2010-08-04T15:24:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	Anyways, it isn't a forced-installation, you'll be able to reinstall the newer if you want ;-)
2010-08-04T15:24:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	You're welcome
2010-08-04T15:25:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	Feel free to ask
2010-08-04T15:27:00.000Z	Misterio	nando	About that I can't answer you now, I'm sorry, but I'm under KDE and never used that applet
