2010-11-16T00:11:00.000Z	tehnef	zenger	please clarify
2010-11-16T00:11:00.000Z	zenger	tehnef	just a sec
2010-11-16T00:14:00.000Z	zenger	tehnef	I am using lampp for my projects, installed / configured everything is ok, even the problems with the chmod i've fixed, next i use sudo nautilus to give me the right to add /edit /drop files in the /opt/lampp folder. When i gedit a file from that folder it opens a new instance of gedit. The problem is it doesn't have my color scheme on it as in regular.On the other hand when i open an instance of gedit on the desktop it has m

2010-11-16T00:15:00.000Z	tehnef	zenger	That's complicated. If it were me and I absolutely wanted to edit using gedit, I would alt-f2 and "gksudo gedit"
2010-11-16T00:16:00.000Z	zenger	tehnef	What can you suggest me? can i get my color scheme into the gedit for that instance of gedit?
2010-11-16T00:16:00.000Z	tehnef	zenger	Browsing the fs with a root-spawned nautilus window, however, is not really a long-term solution. Personally, I would do all my fs stuff with the terminal.
2010-11-16T00:16:00.000Z	zenger	tehnef	can you suggest me a better editor?
2010-11-16T00:16:00.000Z	tehnef	zenger	You should be able to, it's running as root so it should see everything.
2010-11-16T00:17:00.000Z	zenger	tehnef	it gives an error when i import my color scheme =(
2010-11-16T00:17:00.000Z	tehnef	zenger	Generally if I'm going to be editing files with root permissions, I use nano.
2010-11-16T00:17:00.000Z	tehnef	zenger	If you're doing editing that requires your color scheming, I'm willing to bet you're not really doing editing that requires root perms.
2010-11-16T00:18:00.000Z	zenger	tehnef	this "nano" has a right click integrated "open with nano" row??
2010-11-16T00:18:00.000Z	tehnef	zenger	I don't mean to give you a non-answer answer, but this is a linux help channel, after all :P
2010-11-16T00:18:00.000Z	tehnef	zenger	nano is a command-line text editor, but not one with a high learning curve
2010-11-16T00:19:00.000Z	tehnef	zenger	You shouldn't need to have a root-enabled text editor open for long edits. Just configuration changes and such. Anything else, such as long pages of code, etc, should be just fine creating/editing from userland.
2010-11-16T00:24:00.000Z	zenger	tehnef	damn I am so stupid ) I am forgeting that ubuntu is linux and it needs the chmod rights)
