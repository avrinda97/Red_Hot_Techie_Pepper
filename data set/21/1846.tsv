2011-04-30T09:24:00.000Z	rahduke		ive installed nvidia drivers from their site a hundred times over
2011-04-30T09:25:00.000Z	rahduke		 _pg_ that is a pain in the ass
2011-04-30T09:25:00.000Z	_pg_	rahduke	youre tellin me!
2011-04-30T09:26:00.000Z	_pg_	rahduke	i have calibrated a hundred times over, but i cant figure out the dead zones. and it keeps messing with my trackpad so i need to unplug in cause the input goes crazy
2011-04-30T09:26:00.000Z	rahduke	_pg_	you need brand a brandnew controller, the sticks are loose and jscal is too sensitive
2011-04-30T09:26:00.000Z	_pg_	rahduke	thats why i want to map some deadzones
2011-04-30T09:27:00.000Z	_pg_	rahduke	yes
2011-04-30T09:28:00.000Z	rahduke	_pg_	yea man its never going to be "right"
2011-04-30T09:28:00.000Z	_pg_	rahduke	you can map deadzones, i just cant figure it out
2011-04-30T09:28:00.000Z	rahduke	_pg_	your not hearing me, even if u do map them they are not good enough
2011-04-30T09:29:00.000Z	_pg_	rahduke	then map them larger? i mean thats the whole point of deadzones
2011-04-30T09:32:00.000Z	rahduke	_pg_	as you use the remote the sticks get loose and the deadspots kinda move around
2011-04-30T09:33:00.000Z	_pg_	rahduke	so i will map them huge lol it doesnt matter once i can map some deadzones ill figure it out from there
2011-04-30T09:34:00.000Z	rahduke	_pg_	ok go for it!
