2010-04-18T17:33:00.000Z	circuitman		i've just installed sun virtualbox but could not find that applicatin in the applications list
2010-04-18T17:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 from command line its 'virtualbox' or 'Virtualbox' i belive.
2010-04-18T17:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 it proberly is in the menus.. you just aint seeing it..  perhaps log out/back in..
2010-04-18T17:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 reading of the virtualbox manual/guide at its homepage  #1 tip
2010-04-18T17:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 best advice for mint... dont bother.. stick with and learn ubuntu.
2010-04-18T17:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 well if yusing linux.. it has a 'linux' item...
2010-04-18T17:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 i doubt if it really matters much.
2010-04-18T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 go for it then.
2010-04-18T17:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 did i mention a tip about reading the virtualbox manual?       it proberly dosent matter really..
2010-04-18T17:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 pick ubuntu then?
2010-04-19T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 if its source - you compile it..
2010-04-19T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 theres various tools like 'gnome-art' that let you easially install most theme parts from the gnome art web site.
2010-04-19T17:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 find it at the various gnome art web sites and download it..
2010-04-19T17:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 not all 'themes' are actually themes.. many are  theme 'parts'
2010-04-19T17:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 it seems that an Aurora theme engine is in the repos.
2010-04-19T17:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 bit that seems to be in Lucid only
2010-04-19T17:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 it will still work.. just not look 100% like intended.  Not really a big deal. I mix and match the theme parts how i like anyway
2010-04-19T17:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 or use the PPA repos for the different theme parts --> https://launchpad.net/~merlwiz79/+archive/aurora
2010-04-19T17:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 so use that ppa repo
2010-04-19T17:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	 i dont bend over to far backwards for themes any more.. most look almost identical. and theres very good ones allready in the repos ready to be installed. or in alternative PPA repos.
2010-04-19T17:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	circuitman	  that url i gave. has the theme engine - allready done. so you can instgll it with a few commands.
