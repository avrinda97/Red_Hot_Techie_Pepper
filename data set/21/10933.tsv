2004-12-30T12:39:00.000Z	spikeb		but rw isnt good heh
2004-12-30T12:39:00.000Z	spikeb		hmm, i dont know what's wrong with it
2004-12-30T12:40:00.000Z	spikeb		so THAT's who broke xorg
2004-12-30T12:40:00.000Z	spikeb		quit eating those packages!
2004-12-30T12:40:00.000Z	spikeb		heh
2004-12-30T12:41:00.000Z	spikeb		im considering running debian unstable on a box here shortly
2004-12-30T12:41:00.000Z	spikeb		heh
2004-12-30T12:43:00.000Z	spikeb		xorg will make it's way back into sid from hoary though, i'd hope
2004-12-30T12:44:00.000Z	spikeb		heh
2004-12-30T12:44:00.000Z	spikeb		N+30 days for that :)
2004-12-30T12:44:00.000Z	cef	spikeb	well depends.. if sarge gets released before hoary..
2004-12-30T12:45:00.000Z	cef	spikeb	yeah I know..
2004-12-30T12:45:00.000Z	cef	spikeb	which means xorg most likely won't come from hoary, but perky
2005-01-03T07:56:00.000Z	spikeb	cef	i've had that problem forever
2005-01-03T07:57:00.000Z	cef	spikeb	yeah and how'd you get around it? or haven't you? cos if I can't do this, I'll just have to go back to debian
2005-01-03T07:58:00.000Z	spikeb	cef	well, the programs that use cdrecord work fine, just cdrecord directly doesnt work for me (niether do many other versions in other distros)
2005-01-03T07:58:00.000Z	cef	spikeb	which programs in particular?
2005-01-03T07:58:00.000Z	spikeb	cef	so i just use nautilus-cd-burner or k3b
2005-01-03T07:59:00.000Z	cef	spikeb	unfortunately it doesn't copy cd's.. it burns iso's and makes data disks, but it doesn't 'copy' from one device to another
2005-01-03T08:01:00.000Z	cef	spikeb	well it's a sort of show stopper for my machine..
2005-01-03T08:03:00.000Z	cef	spikeb	and while I can use xcdroast on debian, it doesn't seem to work (for me) on ubuntu
