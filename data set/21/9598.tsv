2005-08-26T09:35:00.000Z	kevor	hopeng	i did too, but you will notice most Icons are the same, and when you find the names for the stuff you want, it'll suit you real fine real fast
2005-08-26T09:36:00.000Z	hopeng	kevor	one thing i hate the most is i usualy pressed spacebar to move the area in PS, annd this & other shortcut isnt the same in gimp :(
