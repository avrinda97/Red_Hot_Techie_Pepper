2008-04-28T09:34:00.000Z	BSG75		every once in a while the battery icon shows up on my notification area and tells me my laptop battery is very low and charging.. however, if I unplug power and plug it back again, it says it's fully charged.  if I type acpi -b at prompt it shows me my battery is fully charged.  Anyone know what's going on?
2008-04-28T09:35:00.000Z	BSG75		I am using 8.04 amd64
2008-04-28T09:37:00.000Z	SuperQ	BSG75	Software coders have been bad at writing 64bit stuff since as long as I can remember
2008-04-28T09:38:00.000Z	BSG75	SuperQ	hmm not finding them any worse from my experience.. but I look forward to finding crappy 64bit stuff :)
2008-04-28T09:38:00.000Z	SuperQ	BSG75	on average, 64bit is fine
2008-04-28T09:39:00.000Z	SuperQ	BSG75	it just doesn't make sense for most people
2008-04-28T09:39:00.000Z	BSG75	SuperQ	I agree with that completely :)
2008-04-28T09:46:00.000Z	BSG75	SuperQ	exactly .. me very confused
2008-04-28T09:41:00.000Z	BSG75	SuperQ	know of any bug with the battery applet in gnome?
2008-04-28T09:41:00.000Z	SuperQ	BSG75	none recently
2008-04-28T09:42:00.000Z	BSG75	SuperQ	I don't understand why this applet thinks my battery is depleted but charging when acpid -b shows fully charged .. is this something I should worry bout?
2008-04-28T09:42:00.000Z	SuperQ	BSG75	hrm
2008-04-28T09:43:00.000Z	SuperQ	BSG75	ls /proc/acpi/battery/
2008-04-28T09:43:00.000Z	BSG75	SuperQ	do you want the "state"?
2008-04-28T09:44:00.000Z	SuperQ	BSG75	no, i'm just wondering if the kernel thinks there is more than one BATX dir
2008-04-28T09:44:00.000Z	BSG75	SuperQ	ack .. there is nothing writted in BAT0
2008-04-28T09:44:00.000Z	SuperQ	BSG75	huh
2008-04-28T09:45:00.000Z	BSG75	SuperQ	yes .. however.. nothing is noted under alarm, info or state
2008-04-28T09:45:00.000Z	SuperQ	BSG75	huh
2008-04-28T09:45:00.000Z	SuperQ	BSG75	no idea
2008-04-28T09:46:00.000Z	BSG75	SuperQ	nm .. I am an idiot
