2009-04-22T07:01:00.000Z	juls4		NVIDA is so dodgy on ubuntu. I think i have to go back to windows O_0
2009-04-22T07:01:00.000Z	philh	juls4	what's the trouble?
2009-04-22T07:05:00.000Z	juls4	philh	NVIDIA doesn't detect the full resolution of my monitor, so everything is stretched horizontally. I've tried to use xradr to create a new modeline/resolution but it fails. Although that's not the worst of it - whenever I boot into ubuntu, it's like my desktop has 'zoomed' in, and I have to move my mouse to the corners of the screen for it to pann to the menu. Then I end up having to chose the same resolution, which fixes the issue and rescales it back into
2009-04-22T07:06:00.000Z	philh	juls4	and you've tried changing the resolution using nvidia-settings?
2009-04-22T07:07:00.000Z	juls4	philh	you're talking about the NVIDIA X server settings in system/admin?
2009-04-22T07:07:00.000Z	juls4	philh	then yes.
2009-04-22T07:09:00.000Z	juls4	philh	NVIDIA seems to be the problem in this situation, not a saviour. I've tried writing the settings to the xorg.conf file.
2009-04-22T07:09:00.000Z	philh	juls4	have you tried backing up your old xorg.conf and writing a fresh one instead of merging?
2009-04-22T07:10:00.000Z	juls4	philh	How do I do that?
2009-04-22T07:10:00.000Z	juls4	philh	write a new one, that is.
2009-04-22T07:12:00.000Z	juls4	philh	okay, I just tried to create a new one with NVIDIA: "Unable to create new X config backup file '/etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup'"
2009-04-22T07:13:00.000Z	philh	juls4	you need to use sudo before it'll be able to write to /etc directly, or you can have it write to a file in your home directory and copy it across with sudo afterwards
2009-04-22T07:15:00.000Z	juls4	philh	I can't save it anywhere but in the location it specifies.
2009-04-22T07:16:00.000Z	philh	juls4	are you sure? are you looking at X server display configuration?
2009-04-22T07:17:00.000Z	philh	juls4	there's a save to X configuration file button at the bottom of that section, clicking that will give you the option to save to another location and merge with the existing xorg or not
2009-04-22T07:19:00.000Z	juls4	philh	No, that's just asking you to point it to the location of your xorg.conf file.. I tried to create a new empty file on the desktop named xorg.conf but it won't write to it.
2009-04-22T07:20:00.000Z	philh	juls4	ok, try the show preview button and just copy and paste the new xorg config
2009-04-22T07:24:00.000Z	juls4	philh	I've got 2 xorg.conf in my x11 directory. One named xorg.conf and the other xorg.conf.20090420200128
2009-04-22T07:25:00.000Z	philh	juls4	copy the current version to xorg.conf.bak and replace with the freshly generated output from nvidia-settings
2009-04-22T07:25:00.000Z	philh	juls4	you are capable of copying your xorg.conf.bak back in the event that x fails to start, right?
2009-04-22T07:32:00.000Z	juls4	philh	Okay i'm going to reboot and see if it helps. thanks mate.
