2007-10-30T05:24:00.000Z	nemik	alecwh	intel 965?
2007-10-30T05:24:00.000Z	alecwh	nemik	I think, yes.
2007-10-30T05:25:00.000Z	nemik	alecwh	do what MilitantPotato said.
2007-10-30T05:25:00.000Z	nemik	alecwh	video over xv yea doesn't work now but you can change it to use X11 for video which works fine. uses a little more CPU though but nothing terrible
2007-10-30T05:26:00.000Z	alecwh	nemik	Ok, how do I do that?
2007-10-30T05:26:00.000Z	nemik	alecwh	what do you use to watch videos? which app?
2007-10-30T05:27:00.000Z	nemik	alecwh	do you use gstreamer or xine? i would recommend xine
2007-10-30T05:27:00.000Z	alecwh	nemik	gstreamer, and I love it. :)
2007-10-30T05:28:00.000Z	nemik	alecwh	run gstreamer-conf or something like that, tab-complete after gstre
2007-10-30T05:28:00.000Z	alecwh	nemik	how do I do that, and watch videos?
2007-10-30T05:28:00.000Z	nemik	alecwh	then in there you'll see xv or something like that, change that to do X11
2007-10-30T05:29:00.000Z	nemik	alecwh	i said tab-complete after, i don't have gstreamer and don't know the app off-hand
2007-10-30T05:29:00.000Z	nemik	alecwh	crdlb is right, that one
2007-10-30T05:30:00.000Z	alecwh	nemik	Ok. I'm at hte screen, and here are the options: Autodetect, X Video System (No Xv), X Video System (X11/XShm/Xv), Custom
2007-10-30T05:31:00.000Z	nemik	alecwh	the X Video with no Xv
2007-10-30T05:32:00.000Z	alecwh	nemik	THAT WORKED! :D
2007-10-30T05:32:00.000Z	nemik	alecwh	cool
