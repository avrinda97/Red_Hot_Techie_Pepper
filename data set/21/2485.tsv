2010-05-31T07:45:00.000Z	magik		Hey guys, i really need someone to help me. I often have two terminals open on my desktop most of the time. One for ubuntu irc and one for another irc. But it's annoying when i keep having to start up the terminals and write all the stuff. Is there any way i can make two terminals open and connect to the ircs of my choice on startup? Thanks in advance!
2010-05-31T07:46:00.000Z	ChogyDan	magik	why not make a script/hotkey?
2010-05-31T07:46:00.000Z	magik		How would i do that chogydan?
2010-05-31T07:47:00.000Z	ChogyDan	magik	I don't know specifics, but what is the command you use to start the irc?
2010-05-31T07:47:00.000Z	magik		i use two
2010-05-31T07:48:00.000Z	magik		one is /connect irc.ubuntu.com then i have to do /join #ubuntu to join the channel
2010-05-31T07:48:00.000Z	ChogyDan	magik	how do you start irc though?
2010-05-31T07:48:00.000Z	magik		i open a terminal
2010-05-31T07:48:00.000Z	magik		and type those commands
2010-05-31T07:48:00.000Z	ChogyDan	magik	a gnome-terminal?
2010-05-31T07:49:00.000Z	magik		yeah
2010-05-31T07:49:00.000Z	ChogyDan	magik	Ive no idea.  I didn't know gnome-terminal could do irc.  It certianly doesn't seem to be working here
2010-05-31T07:50:00.000Z	magik	ChogyDan	I can't remember exactly what i did. Google it. Try to look along the lines of irssi << that's what the package was called.
2010-05-31T07:50:00.000Z	magik		brb testing
2010-05-31T07:52:00.000Z	magik		Back
2010-05-31T07:53:00.000Z	ChogyDan	magik	irssi is the irc client.  I think you just want to configure that
2010-05-31T07:53:00.000Z	magik		I still don't understand guys.
2010-05-31T07:54:00.000Z	magik		How would i get it to stat up?
2010-05-31T07:54:00.000Z	ChogyDan	magik	I can't help further, as I use pidgin
2010-05-31T07:54:00.000Z	magik		I see
