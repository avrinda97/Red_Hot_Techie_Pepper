Any ideas?
2007-04-15T12:32:00.000Z	dadan_x		yes
2007-04-15T12:32:00.000Z	dadan_x		but the same thin happens with ubuntu
2007-04-15T12:32:00.000Z	dadan_x		and in the xubuntu channel nobody answers
2007-04-15T12:32:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	you have a minimal comp. for ubuntu
2007-04-15T12:33:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	are you installing or using the live cd?
2007-04-15T12:34:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	if you install you can use single user mode to work with X from the command line
2007-04-15T12:34:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	use alternative, install and use the terminal
2007-04-15T12:34:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	I think it is a ram issue, although I don't your graphics card
2007-04-15T12:35:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	what is your graphics card?
2007-04-15T12:35:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	so its enough
2007-04-15T12:35:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	NO
2007-04-15T12:36:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	I suggest using alternative install then use single user mode
2007-04-15T12:36:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	just install like you normally would
2007-04-15T12:37:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	when it restarts and you see grub there are 2 options either single user of the normal
2007-04-15T12:37:00.000Z	dadan_x	yiga1	but it does not even restart
2007-04-15T12:38:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	you want to install without graphics
2007-04-15T12:38:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	you have tried in non-graphical mode?
2007-04-15T12:39:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	I am sorry I don't have enough information
2007-04-15T12:40:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	I would try xubunu, they are used to dealing with a minimal set up like the one u have
2007-04-15T12:40:00.000Z	yiga1	dadan_x	#xubuntu
