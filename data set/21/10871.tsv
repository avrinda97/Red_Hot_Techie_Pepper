2004-10-24T14:25:00.000Z	joolz	|trey|	with Paris
2004-10-19T07:51:00.000Z	|trey|	joolz	yes, its an upstream bug for grub... appears to be fixed though... I don't use Winblows, so I couldn't tell you for sure...
2004-10-19T07:54:00.000Z	joolz	|trey|	maybe I'll give it a go this weekend on the notebook. I'll let you guys know how it went.
2004-10-19T07:55:00.000Z	|trey|	joolz	sounds good... if you have problems, make sure to file bugs about it...
2004-10-24T13:31:00.000Z	|trey|	joolz	its hardly different from the cron installed... not a big deal...
2004-10-24T13:32:00.000Z	|trey|	joolz	I never reboot...
2004-10-24T13:33:00.000Z	joolz	|trey|	I get a new kernel every day :)
2004-10-24T13:34:00.000Z	|trey|	joolz	first question, why?
2004-10-24T13:36:00.000Z	|trey|	joolz	I wouldn't be running a beta in a company...
2004-10-24T13:36:00.000Z	joolz	|trey|	no, of course not. But it will come out of beta someday, right?
2004-10-24T13:37:00.000Z	joolz	|trey|	:)
2004-10-24T13:38:00.000Z	|trey|	joolz	at least not if you stick to warty after that point... but you would in a company environment...
2004-10-24T13:41:00.000Z	joolz	|trey|	yes, I would. but linux on all desktops is yet a bit of a dream. Maybe in a year or so. I;m running U now on my own desktop
2004-10-24T13:42:00.000Z	|trey|	joolz	in all honesty, I would likely use Novell  in a business environment if I had the choice anyway...
2004-10-24T13:42:00.000Z	joolz	|trey|	I have a netware server + two debian stables
2004-10-24T13:44:00.000Z	|trey|	joolz	Novell Open Enterprise Server = EVERYTHING running on both kernels..
2004-10-24T13:54:00.000Z	|trey|	joolz	GNOME = "intuitive for everyone", KDE = "we want to have every feature from everywhere, but it can't slow shit down"
2004-10-24T14:23:00.000Z	joolz	|trey|	what certification is that? Aren't local goverments free too choose what best?
2004-10-24T14:23:00.000Z	|trey|	joolz	there are criteria they must meet... I dunno, read on Novell's "in the press" section...
2004-10-24T14:25:00.000Z	|trey|	joolz	with what?
2004-10-27T06:32:00.000Z	|trey|	joolz	I told you to use testing, not unstable!!
