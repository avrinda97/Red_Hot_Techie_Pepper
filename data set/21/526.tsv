2011-10-22T13:30:00.000Z	Newbeeans		I have invalid format on one monitor & 59.9 low resolution error on another. Help please I'm new sorry guys
2011-10-22T13:32:00.000Z	Newbeeans		I can only see ubuntu from live cd :(
2011-10-22T13:33:00.000Z	Newbeeans		I only have ubuntu
2011-10-22T13:35:00.000Z	Newbeeans		Is there a way to fix resolution from cd?
2011-10-22T13:35:00.000Z	jrib	Newbeeans	I'd try what's on that wiki page (a live cd shouldn't be required).  If you're booting from a live cd just mount your install and chroot in
2011-10-22T13:37:00.000Z	jrib	Newbeeans	you need to be more specific
2011-10-22T13:40:00.000Z	jrib	Newbeeans	what exactly does it say in full?
2011-10-22T13:41:00.000Z	jrib	Newbeeans	can you get to grub? (hold shift during boot)
2011-10-22T13:43:00.000Z	jrib	Newbeeans	hmm, so the message pops up before /as grub loads?  Weird.
2011-10-22T13:44:00.000Z	jrib	Newbeeans	well you should be able to modify grub settings from there, but I'm not sure what you would need to modify
2011-10-22T13:47:00.000Z	jrib	Newbeeans	the first thing I might try is to have the grub menu always show up (by editing grub settings).  Note you need to edit /etc/default/grub and then run update-grub *in the chroot for your install*
2011-10-22T13:48:00.000Z	jrib	Newbeeans	first, mount the partition for your install.  Are you able to do that?
2011-10-22T13:49:00.000Z	jrib	Newbeeans	right, but you want to access the partition on your hard drive for your install
2011-10-22T13:50:00.000Z	jrib	Newbeeans	in nautilus, you can probably just click on your partition
2011-10-22T13:51:00.000Z	jrib	Newbeeans	can you open a terminal?
2011-10-22T13:52:00.000Z	jrib	Newbeeans	I am also not familiar with unity. Maybe someone else can help you with that step (ask the channel)
2011-11-13T19:40:00.000Z	jrib	Newbeeans	be more specific.  What does "fail" mean?
2011-11-13T19:41:00.000Z	Newbeeans	jrib	Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-audio-dev/ppa/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found
2011-11-13T19:41:00.000Z	jrib	Newbeeans	that ppa does not exist for oneiric
2011-11-13T19:42:00.000Z	Newbeeans	jrib	oh I'm trying to get audio to work.
2011-11-13T19:42:00.000Z	jrib	Newbeeans	ask your actual question
