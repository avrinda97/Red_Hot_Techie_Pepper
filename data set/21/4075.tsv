2008-10-21T20:59:00.000Z	w0ls0n		anyone here know of any supported SATA addon cards for ubuntu? I don't have any onboard SATA Ports and would like to use a SATA drive.
2008-10-21T21:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	w0ls0n	most should work
2008-10-21T21:01:00.000Z	w0ls0n	erUSUL	how would I know what does/doesn't work?

2008-10-24T18:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	w0ls0n	yep usually the connection keeps alive when you shut down X
2008-10-24T19:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	w0ls0n	"sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
2008-11-26T00:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	w0ls0n	it is installed by default afaik
2008-12-03T21:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	w0ls0n	you can safely ignore that error
2008-12-03T21:13:00.000Z	w0ls0n	erUSUL	I have other messages of the same style in dmesg as well
2008-12-03T21:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	w0ls0n	yes there are two one from "sd" and one from "sr" ?
2008-12-03T21:15:00.000Z	w0ls0n	erUSUL	correct
2008-12-03T21:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	w0ls0n	both equally harmless afaik
2008-12-03T21:15:00.000Z	w0ls0n	erUSUL	you have any idea how to tell if I have the proper video driver installed?
2008-12-03T21:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	w0ls0n	which graphic card?
2008-12-03T21:16:00.000Z	w0ls0n	erUSUL	its integrated on the mobo. Any way to tell?
2008-12-03T21:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	w0ls0n	lspci | grep -i vga
2008-12-03T21:17:00.000Z	w0ls0n	erUSUL	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 661/741/760 PCI/AGP or 662/761Gx PCIE VGA Display Adapter (rev 03)
2008-12-03T21:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	w0ls0n	well i spect the system to use the right driver... but you can check the /var/log/Xorg.0.log to make sure
2008-12-03T21:20:00.000Z	w0ls0n	erUSUL	xserver-xorg-video-sis is already the newest version
2008-12-03T21:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	w0ls0n	?
2008-12-03T21:21:00.000Z	w0ls0n	erUSUL	sorry wrong channel
