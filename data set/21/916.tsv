2011-04-17T11:15:00.000Z	bot_killer		can anyone suggest a good compilation tool? I'm new to linux, and I'm looking for something easy and efficient
2011-04-17T11:16:00.000Z	bot_killer		oh sorry I meant configuration and make tool?
2011-04-17T11:16:00.000Z	bot_killer		I have certain C codes
2011-04-17T11:16:00.000Z	bot_killer		I want it all to get installed
2011-04-17T11:16:00.000Z	pfifo	bot_killer	what does the package require?
2011-04-17T11:16:00.000Z	bot_killer		yes I read about it in wikipedia... do you think that's good?
2011-04-17T11:17:00.000Z	bot_killer		the wiki page was very critical about it
2011-04-17T11:17:00.000Z	bot_killer		said it was old and did unnecesarry things
2011-04-17T11:17:00.000Z	bot_killer	pfifo	what do you mean?
2011-04-17T11:17:00.000Z	bot_killer		I have some basic C programs
2011-04-17T11:17:00.000Z	bot_killer		that use certain libraries like fftw
2011-04-17T11:17:00.000Z	pfifo	bot_killer	what kind of tools are you currently using? and on what OS?
2011-04-17T11:18:00.000Z	bot_killer		I'm writing my codes in C in ubuntu, and compiling it using g++ (gcc)
2011-04-17T11:18:00.000Z	bot_killer		now I have a group of codes
2011-04-17T11:18:00.000Z	bot_killer		(.C files)
2011-04-17T11:18:00.000Z	bot_killer		and .o files
2011-04-17T11:19:00.000Z	pfifo	bot_killer	but are they currently designed to work with anything special?
2011-04-17T11:20:00.000Z	bot_killer		they are designed to work using pipelining. example -    input.dat | myfile | output.dat
2011-04-17T11:20:00.000Z	bot_killer		myfile will process the input file, perform certain operations (like the fourier transform), and output it in output.dat
2011-04-17T11:20:00.000Z	bot_killer		ohk then cmake it is!
2011-04-17T11:20:00.000Z	pfifo	bot_killer	you seem to be able to chose any option you want, autoconf is nice and mature, and the kids love cmake
