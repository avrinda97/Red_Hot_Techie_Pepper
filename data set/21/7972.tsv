2008-11-08T20:06:00.000Z	jrib	robert__	read what ubottu told you please
2010-03-26T01:56:00.000Z	jrib	robert__	erm, what?  What are you trying to accomplish exactly?
2010-03-26T01:58:00.000Z	jrib	robert__	it will run fine in script, why do you want it in a script though?
2010-03-26T01:59:00.000Z	jrib	robert__	pastebin what you are doing
2010-03-26T02:00:00.000Z	jrib	robert__	that's fine, now what are *you* doing that lets you conclude the script runs and doesn't replace resolv.conf
2010-03-26T02:02:00.000Z	jrib	robert__	you aren't answering my question
2010-03-26T02:04:00.000Z	jrib	robert__	that's fine, now what are *you* doing that lets you conclude the script runs and doesn't replace resolv.conf
2010-03-26T02:04:00.000Z	jrib	robert__	that's fine, now what are *you* doing that lets you conclude the script runs and doesn't replace resolv.conf?  I forgot the question mark
2010-03-26T02:05:00.000Z	jrib	robert__	do you understand what I am asking you?
2010-03-26T02:06:00.000Z	jrib	robert__	fine, create the resolv.conf as he says and modify the script so it uses an absolute path
