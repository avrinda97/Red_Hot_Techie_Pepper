2011-12-16T21:14:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	resonantsky	 share the procedure with us, for future reference
2011-12-16T21:15:00.000Z	resonantsky	MonkeyDust	depending on disty, adding the apt line deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu oneiric to synaptc and allowing an upgrade worked for me
2011-12-16T21:16:00.000Z	resonantsky	MonkeyDust	after that the previous disty became unstable, moved on to booting the livecd and running the upgrade
2011-12-16T21:16:00.000Z	resonantsky	MonkeyDust	basically adding the standard repo for 11.10 to an older repo 10.04 and then simply allowing a one time update/upgrade and then moving to the upgrade install from the live cd
2011-12-16T21:16:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	resonantsky	 how did you upgrade an existing installation using the live cd?
2011-12-16T21:17:00.000Z	resonantsky	MonkeyDust	I added the first ubuntu repo and did an update/upgrade via synaptic
2011-12-16T21:17:00.000Z	resonantsky	MonkeyDust	then I booted the live cd and did the upgrade install
2011-12-16T21:18:00.000Z	resonantsky	MonkeyDust	its tricky because you have accept its a once off thing, you have to finish the initial package upgrade from the repository then move on to the live cd upgrade for it to work
2011-12-16T21:19:00.000Z	resonantsky		i just upgraded from 10.04 to 11.10 and its working like a charm, with all my old programs and /home directory
2011-12-16T21:19:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	resonantsky	 i'm asking, because it sounds tricky :) why not write the procedure and use pastebin to paste it here
2011-12-16T21:20:00.000Z	resonantsky	MonkeyDust	actually what I did first was unpack the filesystem.squashfs file into my /home dir... but i don't think that had anything to do with the upgrade...
2011-12-16T21:28:00.000Z	resonantsky	MonkeyDust	do you still want that pastebin ?
2011-12-16T21:28:00.000Z	resonantsky	MonkeyDust	here http://pastebin.com/rmheB0gU
2011-12-16T21:28:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	resonantsky	 not just me, the question occurs frequently, maybe it can be used by ubottu, to help others
2011-12-16T21:30:00.000Z	resonantsky	MonkeyDust	I'd like to do it again to make sure of what I did, you should see my sources.list now ;)
2011-12-16T21:30:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	resonantsky	 refine it first, then share it with the community :)
2011-12-16T21:31:00.000Z	resonantsky	MonkeyDust	yeah, I could look into and post it on ubuntuforums...
2011-12-16T21:31:00.000Z	resonantsky		It just worked ;]
2011-12-16T21:32:00.000Z	resonantsky	MonkeyDust	i just added the microverse archive repo and upgraded via synaptic...
2011-12-16T21:32:00.000Z	resonantsky	MonkeyDust	thing is, now my synaptic won't run, gives an error and exits...
2011-12-16T21:33:00.000Z	resonantsky	MonkeyDust	everything else works like a charm, even services from the previous version..
