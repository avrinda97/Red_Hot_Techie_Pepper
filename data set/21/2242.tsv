2009-11-28T19:21:00.000Z	decora		where do i go for help with compiling an ubuntu source package, when it tells me dependencies are broken
2009-11-28T19:21:00.000Z	LjL	decora	have you typed "sudo apt-get build-dep packagename"?
2009-11-28T19:22:00.000Z	decora	LjL	Yes... that also fails
2009-11-28T19:22:00.000Z	LjL	decora	you mean that command fails, or compiling fails after that command?
2009-11-28T19:23:00.000Z	decora	LjL	sorry... E: Build-dependencies for gnome-utils could not be satisfied.
2009-11-28T19:25:00.000Z	LjL	decora	it seems to work for me on Hardy; i guess you're on Karmic? maybe it's bug filing time
2009-11-28T19:27:00.000Z	decora	LjL	thanks anyways
2009-11-28T19:28:00.000Z	LjL	decora	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list please
2009-11-28T19:30:00.000Z	decora	LjL	standby....
2009-11-28T19:32:00.000Z	LjL	decora	you have neither the -updates nor the -security repositories enabled. that's not good.
2009-11-28T19:33:00.000Z	decora	LjL	i dont remember touching any of this stuff ever, its a default netbook install... how do i fix ?
2009-11-28T19:34:00.000Z	LjL	decora	replace your list with this amended one: http://paste.ubuntu.com/330312/
2009-11-28T19:34:00.000Z	LjL	decora	then type "sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade". it'll probably download a fair bit of packages, if you never had these enabled before.
2009-11-28T19:39:00.000Z	decora	LjL	doesn't dist-upgrade put me to 9.10?
2009-11-28T19:39:00.000Z	LjL	decora	uh, not really
2009-11-28T19:39:00.000Z	decora	LjL	145 MB over my 3g cell phone modem... here goes nothin'
2009-11-28T19:40:00.000Z	LjL	decora	well, jaunty has been out for quite a long time, so you have a lot of package updates to catch up on...
2009-11-28T20:24:00.000Z	decora	LjL	: I want to say thank you for pointing me to the problem, sudo apt-get build-dep is working now. apparently netbook remix doesn't come with updates enabled in sources.list ?
2009-11-28T20:25:00.000Z	LjL	decora	apparently. doesn't seem like a very good idea though.
2009-11-28T21:51:00.000Z	decora	LjL	thanks again for help. im buggin' out
2009-11-28T21:51:00.000Z	LjL	decora	you're welcome, bye
