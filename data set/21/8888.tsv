2005-12-24T15:58:00.000Z	toya_		hi people
2005-12-24T15:59:00.000Z	toya_		i got a linux question regarding user passwords
2005-12-24T16:01:00.000Z	dooglus	toya_	"passwd -d user" will remove user's password
2005-12-24T16:02:00.000Z	dooglus	toya_	what makes you think it hasn't?  does "su user" not get you straight into user's account after that?
2005-12-24T16:12:00.000Z	dooglus	toya_	3) you used "sudo -i" to become root, which lost your X settings
2005-12-24T16:12:00.000Z	dooglus	toya_	if you "sudo gedit <filename>" as your own user you should be OK
2005-12-24T16:13:00.000Z	toya_	dooglus	oh
2005-12-24T16:13:00.000Z	dooglus	toya_	or, make the root shell with "sudo -s" instead of "sudo -i" and then you'll be able to run X apps.
2005-12-24T16:13:00.000Z	toya_	dooglus	i'm not sure about sudo parameters
2005-12-24T16:13:00.000Z	dooglus	toya_	"sudo -i" replaces your environment with root's.  root's environment doesn't have the necessary variables to be able to connect to your X display
2005-12-24T16:15:00.000Z	toya_	dooglus	/The -l (list) option will list out the allowed (and forbidden) com
2005-12-24T16:15:00.000Z	toya_	dooglus	oh, nvm
2005-12-24T16:17:00.000Z	toya_	dooglus	when i do sudo -l the prompt doesn't change to #
2005-12-24T16:17:00.000Z	dooglus	toya_	what's "sudo -l"?
2005-12-24T16:18:00.000Z	toya_	dooglus	it just lists what i can do if i was in sudo mode
2005-12-24T16:19:00.000Z	dooglus	toya_	why are you running "sudo -l"?
2005-12-24T16:19:00.000Z	toya_	dooglus	i want to gedit my fstab
2005-12-24T16:19:00.000Z	dooglus	toya_	run a terminal, then "sudo gedit /etc/fstab" as yourself
2005-12-24T16:19:00.000Z	toya_	dooglus	or do i have to put sudo in front of my commands?
2005-12-24T16:20:00.000Z	dooglus	toya_	it's recommended that you put "sudo" in front of your commands.  alternatively you can run "sudo -s" to get a root shell which is able to run GUI programs
2005-12-24T16:20:00.000Z	toya_	dooglus	ok thx
