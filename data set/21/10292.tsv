2005-04-22T05:45:00.000Z	Xgates		hey holycow NOW I'm dying on getting a kernel compiled LOL
2005-04-22T05:45:00.000Z	Xgates		damm thing
2005-04-22T05:47:00.000Z	jldugger	Xgates	I always start by trying to rebuild the defualt kernel, and try and work my way towards the goal, ya know?
2005-04-22T05:48:00.000Z	jldugger	Xgates	there's 686 based kernel packages
2005-04-22T05:48:00.000Z	jldugger	Xgates	you might try apt-cache search linux-image
2005-04-22T05:48:00.000Z	Xgates	jldugger	yes I did that 6 years ago experience isnt the problem its Distro specific as in the case something Ubuntu needs that isnt the norm for compiling
2005-04-22T05:49:00.000Z	Xgates	jldugger	I build my own, just need to figure what the problem is with Ubuntu, and what it wants
2005-04-22T05:49:00.000Z	jldugger	Xgates	i dont know if its "Distro Specific"
2005-04-22T05:50:00.000Z	Xgates	jldugger	after running Slackware 5 years and been compiling them since 2.0x I can tell you it is
2005-04-22T05:50:00.000Z	jldugger	Xgates	that error is most frequently caused by not having the proper filesystems built in instead of kernel, but initrd is supposed to fix that.
2005-04-22T05:51:00.000Z	Xgates	jldugger	I have the FS compiled in
2005-04-22T05:51:00.000Z	jldugger	Xgates	where'd you get the source code from?
2005-04-22T05:51:00.000Z	Xgates	jldugger	yes thats what I was thinking and I have been playing with it
2005-04-22T05:51:00.000Z	Xgates	jldugger	apt-get linux-source
2005-04-22T06:31:00.000Z	Xgates	jldugger	well I have ext2 & ext3 compiled in <*>
