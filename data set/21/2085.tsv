2011-07-03T09:53:00.000Z	faina		Magn3ts, I wonder if apt was stripping the architecture flag?
2011-07-03T09:53:00.000Z	faina		And that's why dpkg worked?
2011-07-03T09:53:00.000Z	magn3ts	faina	probably, I don't know what form it expects. I should look it up.
2011-07-03T10:01:00.000Z	magn3ts	faina	just fyi, chrome has built in noscript basically.
2011-07-03T10:02:00.000Z	magn3ts	faina	no it has that too.
2011-07-03T10:13:00.000Z	faina	magn3ts	the browser can touch things that the user id the process is running as has access to
2011-07-03T10:13:00.000Z	magn3ts	faina	the browser can, but not flash content.
2011-07-03T10:14:00.000Z	magn3ts	faina	if there's an exploit it can, but it still can't install software on the local machine without an additional esclation exploit, which I've never ever ever seen in a linux systme, ever.
2011-07-03T10:14:00.000Z	magn3ts	faina	again, only through an exploit or flash.
2011-07-03T10:15:00.000Z	magn3ts	faina	I think he's just confused about interactive webapps, flash content, plugins, and true local applications.
2011-07-03T10:18:00.000Z	faina	magn3ts	is right... firefox will always list the installed extensions
2011-07-03T10:27:00.000Z	faina	magn3ts	don't forget disable unnecessary services....
2011-07-03T10:28:00.000Z	magn3ts	faina	do you disable much out of the box? There's no ssh by default in the desktop version ,etc.
2011-07-03T10:30:00.000Z	magn3ts	faina	for like video?
2011-07-03T10:40:00.000Z	faina	magn3ts	there's some howtos to do an ssh tunnel for vnc
2011-07-03T10:40:00.000Z	magn3ts	faina	oh it's okay, I use NX now. I think I was just playing with Android stuff... although I suppose since I'm rooted I could still do ssh+Vnc on my phone, but I'll just leave it off for now.
2011-07-03T11:05:00.000Z	magn3ts	faina	yes, I tried that angle, didn't help
2011-07-03T13:28:00.000Z	magn3ts	faina	I just got done talking with him
2011-07-03T13:28:00.000Z	magn3ts	faina	I think I'm a sucker.
2011-07-03T13:31:00.000Z	magn3ts	faina	yeah.
2011-07-03T13:32:00.000Z	faina	magn3ts	he tried PMing me a bit, but after he tried to get me to re-assure him that running a windows cracking program was safe I said. "1) no to illegal stuff, and 2) you can never be sure that cracks are safe"
