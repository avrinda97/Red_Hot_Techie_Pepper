2009-04-19T09:13:00.000Z	histo	DasEi	yes you can forward X
2009-04-19T09:13:00.000Z	histo	DasEi	you can forward X through ssh actually the client side just needs to have a way to display it. linux and macos will display it fine but windows needs some help to get going.
2009-04-19T09:14:00.000Z	DasEi	histo	yo, both ubuntu machines in this example
2009-04-19T09:15:00.000Z	histo	DasEi	just use the -X option when you log in to the machine with ssh
2009-04-19T09:16:00.000Z	histo	DasEi	then you can run a comand like firefox &   and it will start in background mode
2009-04-19T09:18:00.000Z	DasEi	histo	It was victorhugo who asked, but thanks for advice :)
2009-07-18T02:38:00.000Z	histo	DasEi	or black
2009-07-18T02:38:00.000Z	histo	DasEi	you can get them in any color
2009-07-18T02:39:00.000Z	DasEi	histo	I'll order one in grey with a red stripe on one side ;-)
2010-02-16T22:14:00.000Z	histo	DasEi	he did i'm reading his question now
2010-02-16T22:26:00.000Z	histo	DasEi	thats essentially what mount --bind is doing the folder is just mounted in multiple locations
2010-02-16T22:28:00.000Z	DasEi	histo	that will work, I was more sanbox orientated in view of damage or jailbraking
2010-02-16T22:30:00.000Z	histo	DasEi	yeah that way he can keep his chroot for the ftp users
2010-02-16T22:31:00.000Z	DasEi	histo	I thought of unison or a rsync (cron) script, so of a real copy, which won't touch the originals
2010-02-16T22:32:00.000Z	histo	DasEi	yeah he could play with permissions and deny write access even in the vsftp conf.
2010-02-16T22:32:00.000Z	histo	DasEi	there are so many ways to accomplish one thing in nix.
2010-02-16T22:53:00.000Z	histo	DasEi	dieter__ i'm confused I thought he had an intel so it may be that ati stuff was installed or something.
2010-02-16T22:53:00.000Z	DasEi	histo	: (18:47:40) DasEi: dieter__: remove the ati, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, restart x
2010-02-16T22:57:00.000Z	histo	DasEi	I don't know what dieter__ installed prior to coming here so good luck.
2010-03-29T04:48:00.000Z	histo	DasEi	it should be after youe xtract the tar should be plain c
2010-03-29T04:48:00.000Z	DasEi	histo	thanks, trying
