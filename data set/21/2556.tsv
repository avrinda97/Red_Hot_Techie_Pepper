2009-09-15T00:22:00.000Z	alechiko		Anybody here have a netbook (Asus EEEPC)
2009-09-15T00:22:00.000Z	edoceo	alechiko	yep
2009-09-15T00:22:00.000Z	edoceo		1005HAB
2009-09-15T00:22:00.000Z	alechiko	edoceo	you have the 160gb drive or smaller solid state?
2009-09-15T00:23:00.000Z	edoceo		160
2009-09-15T00:23:00.000Z	alechiko		hmm
2009-09-15T00:23:00.000Z	alechiko	edoceo	any experience with the smaller ones? I want to install the netbook edition.. im at the partitioning screen
2009-09-15T00:23:00.000Z	alechiko		Ive got 4gb and 16gb (flash), trying to decide where to install root partition in terms of performance
2009-09-15T00:24:00.000Z	edoceo		Well, my ubuntu (Karmic) only takes 2.4 GiB, so I have the WIndows and Karmic side by side (/dev/sda1 & /dev/sda2)
2009-09-15T00:24:00.000Z	alechiko		oh i dont want windows
2009-09-15T00:24:00.000Z	alechiko		but neither of the drives are true SSDs
2009-09-15T00:24:00.000Z	alechiko		one is soldered on.. and the other is just a flash memory card
2009-09-15T00:25:00.000Z	alechiko		but i dont know enough about the performance of either to know which is worthwhile installing the root parititon on
2009-09-15T00:25:00.000Z	edoceo		Oh, I'd put root on the removable thing.
2009-09-15T00:26:00.000Z	edoceo		I have a small soekris board that runs off of a CF plugged onto an IDE controller - but heavy usage of the thing concerns me.  So, I make a point of replacing yearly
2009-09-15T00:27:00.000Z	alechiko		root on the removable flash? its bigger so id like to keep that as my main installation partition
2009-09-15T00:27:00.000Z	alechiko		but... not if it reads and writes much more slowly
2009-09-15T00:28:00.000Z	edoceo	alechiko	yes - put root on /16GiB, or you could put /root and /boot on the 4GiB and then put /home and /var on the 16GiB - so boot and root are on slow fast, big storage on big slow drive
2009-09-15T00:28:00.000Z	edoceo		Maybe...
2009-09-15T00:30:00.000Z	alechiko	edoceo	what about the suggestions on the link u found for me about now having swap space.. i have 2gigs of ram.. i guess thats quite a lot for a small machine... so no swap partition?
2009-09-15T00:32:00.000Z	edoceo	alechiko	Hmm, I'm currently running w/o swap but I'm in the process of fixing this machine, so that's only temporary.  Maybe you can can make the 4Gib thing be /boot (128Mib), /root (2.5GiB) and the rest for swap (or something similar?)
