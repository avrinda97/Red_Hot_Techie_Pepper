2005-03-31T07:28:00.000Z	username		why would 'synaptic' and 'apt-get' have such cumbersome and non-descriptive names?
2005-03-31T07:30:00.000Z	username		it needs to be called something akin to what it does.
2005-03-31T07:32:00.000Z	username		if 'synaptic' and 'apt-get' are the functional equivalent of the conventional 'Software Update', then 'Software Update' is the one I'd use when I think I might want to update my software.
2005-03-31T07:32:00.000Z	username		thehatsrule - I can't go round doing that on everyone elses machines though
2005-03-31T07:33:00.000Z	username		thehatsrule - there's little point in balkanising my own installation
2005-03-31T07:34:00.000Z	username		the names of programs of open-source programs is a significant problem that needs attention.
2005-03-31T07:35:00.000Z	username		it would seem that the people in charge of making open source programs are by and large, quite bad at conceiving viable names for the product.
2005-03-31T07:37:00.000Z	gratuit	username	or with the GPL, you can actually go out, rename every program you want to, and distribute it under the different names
2005-03-31T07:37:00.000Z	username	gratuit	but that really doesn't solve the problem, does it.
2005-03-31T07:38:00.000Z	gratuit	username	I'm not sure I see a problem, are there any specific examples?
2005-03-31T07:38:00.000Z	username	gratuit	well, the specific examples I've already related are 'synaptic' and 'apt-get'
2005-03-31T07:38:00.000Z	username	gratuit	compared to the conventional 'Software Update'
2005-03-31T07:39:00.000Z	username	gratuit	no, it's called 'apt-get', not 'advanced packaging tool-get'
2005-03-31T07:39:00.000Z	gratuit	username	it's an acronym
2005-03-31T07:40:00.000Z	username	gratuit	and who cares how advanced the packaging tool is - it should describe what it does
2005-03-31T07:41:00.000Z	username	gratuit	doesn't matter - who cares - if it's that advanced, it sorts it out for you
2005-03-31T07:42:00.000Z	username	gratuit	when I use Software Update, all I need to know is that it's found some updated software (or not) and it gets on and does it. I don't need to know how or why.
2005-03-31T07:46:00.000Z	gratuit	username	but they arn't the same, some are geared for speed, others for eyecandy, there are many differences between them
2005-03-31T07:49:00.000Z	gratuit	username	have you tried gnome-app-install?
2005-03-31T07:49:00.000Z	username	gratuit	no, never heard of it
2005-03-31T07:51:00.000Z	gratuit	username	it may be more to your liking, so you can at least recommend it to people
