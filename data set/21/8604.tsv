2006-03-17T06:42:00.000Z	sophtpaw		when i try and open Explorer using wine the computer freezes up; this has just happened overnite.
2006-03-17T06:42:00.000Z	sophtpaw		Can someone tell me why this might be
2006-03-17T06:43:00.000Z	sophtpaw		i installed kubuntu on my other partition, the buggy 6.04 version, could that possibly have infected my system?
2006-03-17T06:43:00.000Z	sophtpaw		anyone?
2006-03-17T06:44:00.000Z	sophtpaw		does wine just grind to a halt after a certain amount of use
2006-03-17T06:45:00.000Z	sophtpaw		I know ludicrous idea - just grasping at straws
2006-03-17T06:45:00.000Z	sophtpaw		...for an explanation
2006-03-17T06:45:00.000Z	sophtpaw		well, you got any ideas why apparently suddenly i can't use Explorere
2006-03-17T06:46:00.000Z	chuckyp	sophtpaw	because its a windows app.
2006-03-17T06:46:00.000Z	sophtpaw	chuckyp	like i said i use wineExplorer
2006-03-17T06:47:00.000Z	chuckyp	sophtpaw	I dunnomaybe ask the wine poeple. I don't use that app and wine is buggy.
2006-03-17T06:47:00.000Z	chuckyp	sophtpaw	#winehq
2006-03-17T06:48:00.000Z	chuckyp	sophtpaw	I thnk wine has an unistaller but i'm not sure.,
2006-03-17T06:49:00.000Z	sophtpaw	chuckyp	ok, i'm asking winehq, maybe they'll know
2006-03-17T06:50:00.000Z	chuckyp	sophtpaw	yeah they would know for sure.  My buddy is not online right now I'd ask him he's a wine freak.
2006-03-17T07:29:00.000Z	chuckyp	sophtpaw	open a terminal or ctrl+altF2 and type in killall gnome-panel
2006-03-17T07:30:00.000Z	chuckyp	sophtpaw	should restart you panel
2006-03-17T09:24:00.000Z	chuckyp	sophtpaw	your name doesn't matter just post thne copy the url
2006-03-17T09:24:00.000Z	chuckyp	sophtpaw	if you are trying to upgrade to dapper you should be in #ubuntu+1
2006-03-17T09:26:00.000Z	sophtpaw	chuckyp	not upgrading breezy to dapper; i wanted to have kubuntu on my other half, while keeping breezy as it was till the formal full release
