2008-07-20T21:12:00.000Z	amenado		_tobias-> which one are you trying to access ? from the installed ubuntu by itself or the one with via wubi?
2008-07-20T21:12:00.000Z	amenado		_tobias-> which one are you booted to now?
2008-07-20T21:12:00.000Z	_tobias	amenado	I'm trying to access the old one, the one which I didnt install ubuntu on
2008-07-20T21:14:00.000Z	_tobias	amenado	I installed ubuntu on the master-hdd, and I'm trying to access the slave one, via ubuntu, the slave one was just a backup-drive
2008-07-20T21:15:00.000Z	amenado	_tobias	any filesystem you wanted to view within ubuntu must be mounted, therefore mount the backup-drive
2008-07-20T21:15:00.000Z	_tobias	amenado	how to?
2008-07-20T21:17:00.000Z	_tobias	amenado	will this affect the filesystem in any way?
2008-07-20T21:18:00.000Z	_tobias	amenado	oh, ok :P, thanks for the help :)
2008-07-20T21:19:00.000Z	_tobias	amenado	"mount: you must specify the filesystem type"
2008-07-20T21:21:00.000Z	_tobias	amenado	"mount: only root can do that"
2008-07-20T21:23:00.000Z	_tobias	amenado	oh, yeh, right :P sorry
2008-07-20T21:33:00.000Z	_tobias	amenado	I mounted it, and it went away from the "places"-menu, It was there before I tried to mount it, "250 gb Media Disk"
2008-07-20T21:36:00.000Z	_tobias	amenado	mounting a ntfs-drive in ubuntu
2008-07-20T21:37:00.000Z	amenado	_tobias	so did you do   a    sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdxx  /mnt   where /dev/sdxx is your ntfs partition?
2008-07-20T21:38:00.000Z	_tobias	amenado	yep
2008-07-20T21:39:00.000Z	_tobias	amenado	as nothing at all, and tried to do it again and I get "Device or resource is busy"
2008-07-20T21:41:00.000Z	_tobias	amenado	oh, there it is, but is it able to access it as a normal drive outside the terminal?
2008-07-20T21:44:00.000Z	_tobias	amenado	I get the whole disk with all folders printed in the terminal, and I want to access it with nautilus
2008-07-20T21:44:00.000Z	amenado	_tobias	perhaps you need a tutorial on how to use ubuntu..let me see if i can locate one,
2008-07-20T21:45:00.000Z	_tobias	amenado	Would love that :)
