2009-11-15T10:46:00.000Z	Blue1	Arsin	have you tried re-running grub?

2009-11-15T10:47:00.000Z	Blue1	Arsin	those errors won't go away until windows fixes them....
2009-11-15T10:47:00.000Z	Blue1	Arsin	look at what was suggested earlier:  http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB2
2009-11-15T10:52:00.000Z	Blue1	Arsin	windows gets corrupted during the re-sizing -- usually you just boot into windows and windows fixes it --  has he tried re-running grub-update?
2009-11-15T10:53:00.000Z	Arsin	Blue1	Hasn't done anything, now he's doing that thing you sent me
2009-11-15T10:54:00.000Z	Blue1	Arsin	that is the most comprehensive I've seen thanks to whoever originally posted that...
