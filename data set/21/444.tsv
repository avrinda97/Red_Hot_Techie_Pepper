2012-01-13T07:00:00.000Z	sokak		can be a poorly encoded video with a faulty audio?
2012-01-13T07:01:00.000Z	sokak		try to download the video stream and poke at it with vlc - check the audio encoding
2012-01-13T07:01:00.000Z	meanburrito920	sokak	kk, I'll try that. I did confirm with a friend that it plays fine on his machine, though he is using windows.
2012-01-13T07:06:00.000Z	meanburrito920	sokak	vlc fails to play audio for it. video is fine
2012-01-13T07:10:00.000Z	meanburrito920	sokak	I use chrome, but I tried the video on chrome, ff, and opera. it failed on all three
2012-01-13T07:10:00.000Z	meanburrito920	sokak	is it possible I'm just missing a codec? that seems more likely, as it's consistent across all browsers and would be present on other people's comps?
2012-01-13T07:12:00.000Z	meanburrito920	sokak	audio is aac
2012-01-13T07:13:00.000Z	sokak	meanburrito920	you shall check which gstreamer you have :3
2012-01-13T07:14:00.000Z	sokak	meanburrito920	give a shoot at sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2012-01-13T07:15:00.000Z	meanburrito920	sokak	interesting. I'm now seeing some other videos have the audio cut out a few seconds in.
2012-01-13T07:16:00.000Z	meanburrito920	sokak	and it's already installed
2012-01-13T07:20:00.000Z	meanburrito920	sokak	figured it out to some extent. it appears as though the sound is actually playing, it just gets equalized to crazy low levels.
2012-01-13T07:20:00.000Z	sokak	meanburrito920	can you have a look at alsamixer in terminal? all levels are at an audible point?
2012-01-13T07:21:00.000Z	meanburrito920	sokak	yup, everything's at 100%
2012-01-13T07:23:00.000Z	meanburrito920	sokak	so I hit 'B' which claims to rebalance the audio, and now all my youtube audio is super quiet
2012-01-13T07:24:00.000Z	meanburrito920	sokak	in fact all my audio is now "dead"
2012-01-13T07:24:00.000Z	sokak	meanburrito920	youre close. Tap up with up arrows in all channells, then when is okay, sudo alsactl store
2012-01-13T07:24:00.000Z	meanburrito920	sokak	oops, rebalancing actually muted somehow
2012-01-13T07:25:00.000Z	meanburrito920	sokak	I don't want to store it if it isn't loud enough even when maxed though, right?
2012-01-13T07:26:00.000Z	sokak	meanburrito920	in cause of doubt, close/reopen the session without touching anything, or reboot :3
2012-01-13T07:46:00.000Z	meanburrito920	sokak	I've narrowed it down but I'm still confused. Any aac audio that is someone speaking with little background noise gets "muted".
