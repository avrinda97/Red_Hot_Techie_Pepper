2012-03-13T05:35:00.000Z	Corey		Er.
2012-03-13T05:36:00.000Z	haux	Corey	I guess I'm referring to the WAN IP.
2012-03-13T05:34:00.000Z	Corey	haux	If you ask a more specific question, probably.
2012-03-13T05:35:00.000Z	Corey	haux	"Your" IP address?
2012-03-13T05:35:00.000Z	Corey	haux	If you're
2012-03-13T05:35:00.000Z	Corey	haux	if you're talking about the external IP, you need a port forward in some form.
2012-03-13T05:36:00.000Z	Corey	haux	Yeah, definitely need to forward from that IP to the internal IP of your computer, at least on port 80 but possibly on 443 as well if you're using SSL.
2012-03-13T05:36:00.000Z	haux	Corey	I added forwarding on port 80 on the DSL modem config.
2012-03-13T05:37:00.000Z	haux	Corey	let me go look at it again.
2012-03-13T05:39:00.000Z	haux	Corey	so "Web Server" forwards port 80 and 443. 80 and 443 are shown in columns Port Start, Port End, and Port Map. Does this part sound correct so far?
2012-03-13T05:41:00.000Z	haux	Corey	if that is the case, I assume there's no way around it?
2012-03-13T05:44:00.000Z	Corey	haux	Upgrade your connection class, bind to an alternate port (8080 is popular), or host your stuff somewhere else.
2012-03-13T05:45:00.000Z	haux	Corey	I tried other ports via "Listen" in the config with no success. I think I might be doing that incorrectly?
2012-03-13T05:46:00.000Z	Corey	haux	It sounds like you're putting the cart before the horse.
2012-03-13T05:46:00.000Z	Corey	haux	Make sure you can hit it on your internal IP (not the loopback) first.
2012-03-13T05:46:00.000Z	haux	Corey	I suppose that's the part I am having difficulty with then.
2012-03-13T05:47:00.000Z	haux	Corey	since going to my external ip brings up the modem config, I'm kind of stuck there
2012-03-13T05:47:00.000Z	Corey	haux	No, your local OP.
2012-03-13T05:48:00.000Z	Corey	haux	ipconfig to a pastebin, please.
2012-03-13T05:48:00.000Z	Corey	haux	ifconfig rather
2012-03-13T05:49:00.000Z	haux	Corey	this may save you some trouble, going to 192.168.137.82 shows the Apache test page. If you still need to see the ifconfig output I'll show you.
