2007-06-29T16:40:00.000Z	cupps		I just installed 7.04, and I'm having trouble getting my wireless card working.
2007-06-29T16:41:00.000Z	cupps		How can I update the driver for my wireless card in Ubuntu?
2007-06-29T05:06:00.000Z	cupps		Can someone help me connect wirelessly?
2007-06-29T05:06:00.000Z	ReK_	cupps	what wireless card do you have?
2007-06-29T05:07:00.000Z	cupps		BCM4306, and I've used ndiswrapper and got the driver set up for it.
2007-06-29T05:07:00.000Z	cupps		But I can't connect to my wireless network.
2007-06-29T05:07:00.000Z	ReK_		are the drivers working? see if you can do a scan
2007-06-29T05:07:00.000Z	cupps		How do I do that (still new to ubuntu)?
2007-06-29T05:09:00.000Z	cupps		How can I tell if the drivers for my wireless card re working properly?
2007-06-29T05:09:00.000Z	ReK_	cupps	wlanconfig ath0 list scan
2007-06-29T05:09:00.000Z	ReK_	cupps	wait, sorry, that wont work
2007-06-29T05:10:00.000Z	ReK_	cupps	you want "iwlist ath0 scan"
2007-06-29T05:11:00.000Z	cupps	ReK_	It says "Interface doesn't support scanning."
2007-06-29T05:11:00.000Z	cupps	ReK_	My wireless card shows up under ndiswrapper and iwconfig, but not ifconfig. If that helps.
2007-06-29T05:12:00.000Z	ReK_	cupps	type iwconfig, do you see anything about ath0?
2007-06-29T05:12:00.000Z	cupps		My wireless card is listed as eth1
2007-06-29T05:13:00.000Z	cupps		ndiswrapper
2007-06-29T05:13:00.000Z	ReK_		erm?
2007-06-29T05:13:00.000Z	ReK_		eth1 != wireless...
2007-06-29T05:13:00.000Z	cupps		Well, having installed my driver with ndiswrapper... how do I get it to actually work? :P
2007-06-29T05:13:00.000Z	ReK_	cupps	i dont know ndiswrapper either, but try scanning on eth1 instead of ath0
