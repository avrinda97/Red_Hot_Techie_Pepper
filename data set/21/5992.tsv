2007-06-25T10:20:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		I have a problem, the entries that I put in the Startup Programs part of System>Preferences>Sessions get erased when I reboot.
2007-06-25T10:21:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		I removed the Beagle Desktop client, and added Pidgin to startup, and when I rebooted Beagle started up and no Pidgin.
2007-06-25T10:21:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		and then when I checked, none of my changes stayed in the startup thing
2007-06-25T10:21:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		So does anybody know what is wrong?
2007-06-25T10:23:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		So does anybody know what that is happening?
2007-06-25T10:23:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		Why don't my startup entries stay?
2007-06-25T10:24:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Ausicaemia	I always found that to be annoying
2007-06-25T10:24:00.000Z	Ausicaemia	Paddy_EIRE	Is there a way to fix it?
2007-06-25T10:24:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Ausicaemia	you can have all the things you want to start running already then save session
2007-06-25T10:25:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Ausicaemia	add the entries aswell to make doubly sure
2007-06-25T10:31:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Ausicaemia	did you try what I said
2007-06-25T10:32:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Ausicaemia	it still ultimately the exact same thing
2007-06-25T10:33:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Ausicaemia	but hey, must be a bug with certain installs....unless you want to get into the guts of it and fix it file a bug on launchpad I have
2007-06-25T10:58:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Ausicaemia	have you tried the forums? the way I said works perfectly...I mean how many times are you going to need to change your startup entries at high speed?
2007-06-25T10:59:00.000Z	Ausicaemia	Paddy_EIRE	I've checked the forums, I guess I'll post a thread or something
2007-06-25T11:00:00.000Z	Ausicaemia	Paddy_EIRE	I just want to know why this isn't working. All well and good if saving the session works, but I would prefer to find a solution to this problem.
2007-06-25T11:01:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Ausicaemia	as I said though my desktop has a similar bug and I dont think many ppl would no which file that writes to
2007-06-25T11:01:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Ausicaemia	bugs a bug learn to program if you want to no why its not working
2007-06-25T11:02:00.000Z	Ausicaemia	Paddy_EIRE	It may not be a bug, it may be a permission error, which is exactly why I'm asking the question.
2007-06-25T11:02:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Ausicaemia	either way you'd be quicker tinkering yourself
2007-06-25T11:03:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Ausicaemia	your the only other person besides me that I know of anyway that has encountered this problem
