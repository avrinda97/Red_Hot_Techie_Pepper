2006-05-20T12:34:00.000Z	alan|laptop		ha
2006-05-20T12:34:00.000Z	alan|laptop		ok ^^'
2006-05-20T12:36:00.000Z	nickrud	alan|laptop	I'd say installing linux-headers-$(uname -r) would work, but I don't think you'll find a .config in there
2006-05-20T12:37:00.000Z	nickrud	alan|laptop	I was wrong, there is a .config file if you install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2006-05-20T12:38:00.000Z	alan|laptop	nickrud	kerenl headers installed... yet i still have the same error
2006-05-20T12:40:00.000Z	nickrud	alan|laptop	it could be you're using a howto that's not tailored for the ubuntu file layout
2006-05-20T12:40:00.000Z	alan|laptop	nickrud	well... i'm trying to compile a kernel module for a dvb ub device
2006-05-20T12:40:00.000Z	nickrud	alan|laptop	which dvb device?
2006-05-20T12:43:00.000Z	nickrud	alan|laptop	heh, everything I see seems to be french or german :)
2006-05-20T12:44:00.000Z	alan|laptop	nickrud	lucky i am, i'm french ^^

2006-05-20T12:49:00.000Z	alan|laptop	nickrud	i'm playing around with http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Artec_T1_USB_TV_Box
2006-05-20T12:49:00.000Z	alan|laptop	nickrud	but as i can't compile this dam kernel module... pfffff
2006-05-20T12:49:00.000Z	nickrud	alan|laptop	that might work on dapper, but not on breezy: kernel version >= 2.6.13
2006-05-20T12:49:00.000Z	alan|laptop	nickrud	i'm on dapper...
2006-05-20T12:51:00.000Z	nickrud	alan|laptop	when I see 'I believe the line you need to uncomment is this one:' I get skittish about the docs I'm reading. But I also don't have much faith in usb stuff other than printing and storage working under linux
2006-05-20T12:52:00.000Z	alan|laptop	nickrud	remove printing from your sentence and i agress with you...
2006-05-20T12:55:00.000Z	nickrud	alan|laptop	I gotta call it a night, you're in better hands
