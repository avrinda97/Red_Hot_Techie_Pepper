2008-06-19T21:03:00.000Z	genii	cjae	Or do you mean you have an X server running on one monitor and an entirely different X server running on :1 for instance?
2008-06-19T21:04:00.000Z	genii	cjae	In that case it would be like the ctrl-alt-f1 idea where f<number> is the console you have the second X instance running on
2008-06-19T21:04:00.000Z	cjae	genii	yes

2009-02-12T12:51:00.000Z	cjae	genii	thanks for letting me know you reading, it is nice, I thought the goofy printing was due to using a driver that may not be for the exact model of, which when I checked it wasn't thats why I installed the .deb from brother, the printer seems to be working though
2009-02-12T12:54:00.000Z	cjae	genii	ok worked no error, did that folder somehow get deleted
2009-02-12T12:54:00.000Z	genii	cjae	Good. So now: sudo dpkg --configure -a
2009-02-12T12:55:00.000Z	cjae	genii	yes I did that no error
2009-02-12T12:55:00.000Z	genii	cjae	The packaging system should be unstuck now

2009-02-12T13:01:00.000Z	genii	cjae	I guess you'll need to delete one if it bothers you
