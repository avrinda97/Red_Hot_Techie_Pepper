2008-02-07T12:15:00.000Z	jc	ambar	yep thats exactly what I've got - and you still can't connect
2008-02-07T12:16:00.000Z	jc	ambar	try changing the proxy back to either GNOME or environment
2008-02-07T12:19:00.000Z	ambar	jc	using GNOME it doesn't connect at all. using No Proxy/Environmental i've tried connecting  in Invisible mode, and it says "connecting" but within 2 seconds or so the program is automatically getting closed!
