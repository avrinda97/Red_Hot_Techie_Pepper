2009-02-27T19:58:00.000Z	r3dux		lorednzoud, many.
2009-02-27T19:59:00.000Z	r3dux		I don't find the need to shout the joys of linux from the rooftops. Anyone who uses it will see the ups and downs.
2009-02-27T19:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r3dux	me neither, its another OS with its fair share of issues
2009-02-27T20:00:00.000Z	r3dux	ActionParsnip	 I use linux because I'm now comfortable with it and it does 99% of what I used to do in windows, and another 80% of things I couldn't.
2009-02-27T20:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r3dux	snap
2009-04-17T21:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r3dux	some new games will play on linux just fine
2009-04-17T21:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r3dux	some games have native installers created by the devs
2009-04-17T21:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r3dux	also check the loki installer project
2009-04-17T21:41:00.000Z	r3dux	ActionParsnip	- I will, cheers
2009-04-17T21:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r3dux	on dual core systems vmware runs a lot smooth (or so ive heard)
2009-04-17T21:46:00.000Z	r3dux	ActionParsnip	- I come in here maybe once a month, and each time you're here (3 months in a row) and busy being helpful - I'd just like to say thanks. People like you make it all work.
2009-04-17T21:49:00.000Z	r3dux	ActionParsnip	What does dpkg-reconfigure really do?
2009-04-17T21:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r3dux	configures whatever you say, things like gdm/kdm xserver-xorg, apache2. just lets you run through the initial setup options
2009-04-17T21:51:00.000Z	r3dux	ActionParsnip	whatever I say? Like "dpkg-reconfigure gedit" would re-install gedit over the top with options I can pick?
2009-04-17T21:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r3dux	you will get to choose the options for it (if it has dpkg options that need setting)
2009-05-02T22:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r3dux	people use linux + mame + roms (bought legally) to recreate that
2009-05-02T22:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r3dux	no spectrum, for shame
2011-06-09T23:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r3dux	can be needed
2011-06-09T23:12:00.000Z	r3dux	ActionParsnip	I was just wishing it wasn't.
2011-06-09T23:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r3dux	if it works, who cares
2011-06-09T23:55:00.000Z	r3dux	ActionParsnip	WIN.
