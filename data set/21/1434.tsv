2012-05-09T19:10:00.000Z	tizzo		anyone else having trouble with the precise apt servers?
2012-05-09T19:10:00.000Z	jpds	tizzo	No?
2012-05-09T19:11:00.000Z	jpds	tizzo	That really depends on which mirror you're using too.
2012-05-09T19:20:00.000Z	jpds	tizzo	Yes, which mirror are you using?
2012-05-09T19:22:00.000Z	tizzo	jpds	how do I determine (or change) the mirror I'm using?
2012-05-09T19:23:00.000Z	jpds	tizzo	You're using us.archive.ubuntu.com, which is probably overloaded.
2012-05-09T19:24:00.000Z	tizzo	jpds	blargh
2012-05-09T19:24:00.000Z	jpds	tizzo	Open the Software Centre and go to Edit â†’ Software Sources.
2012-05-09T19:24:00.000Z	tizzo	jpds	uh, I'm on server
2012-05-09T19:25:00.000Z	jpds	tizzo	OK; a proxy appears to be redirecting you.
2012-05-09T19:25:00.000Z	tizzo	jpds	wtf...
2012-05-09T19:25:00.000Z	jpds	tizzo	Try: $ GET http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/
2012-05-09T19:28:00.000Z	tizzo	jpds	weird, yeah it's just hanging
2012-05-09T19:28:00.000Z	jpds	tizzo	Well, something's redirecting you.
2012-05-09T19:28:00.000Z	tizzo	jpds	where can I find a list of mirrors?
2012-05-09T19:29:00.000Z	jpds	tizzo	/usr/share/python-apt/templates/Ubuntu.mirrors
2012-05-09T19:29:00.000Z	tizzo	jpds	Ah. it's opendns
2012-05-09T19:30:00.000Z	jpds	tizzo	Lovely.
2012-05-09T19:38:00.000Z	tizzo	jpds	yep, looks like opendns was sending me off to the wrong place for that url, I replaced it with a mirror and everything is working
2012-05-09T19:39:00.000Z	jpds	tizzo	Cool.
2012-05-09T19:39:00.000Z	tizzo	jpds	thanks for the help
