2008-01-07T23:23:00.000Z	panfist		could anyone please help me try to get my monitor to display in native resolution? no matter what i change in xorg.conf all i get in the screens and graphics window is the same old generic "plug and play" monitor
2008-01-07T23:23:00.000Z	hairulfr	panfist	Have you tried adding resolutions and the like to your xorg.conf?
2008-01-07T23:25:00.000Z	hairulfr	panfist	Did you add that resolution to your xorg.conf and then select it as default?
2008-01-07T23:25:00.000Z	panfist	hairulfr	yes but no matter what values i add i get the default 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768 and 1600x1200 to choose from in the screen and graphics window
2008-01-07T23:25:00.000Z	hairulfr	panfist	Weird
2008-01-07T23:25:00.000Z	panfist	hairulfr	what do you mean select it as the default
2008-01-07T23:32:00.000Z	hairulfr	panfist	And look at what resolutions i gives you, choose then ones you want
2008-01-07T23:33:00.000Z	panfist	hairulfr	and akorn ok i'll try
2008-01-07T23:38:00.000Z	hairulfr	panfist	can you pastebin your xorg, please
2008-01-07T23:39:00.000Z	panfist	hairulfr	this was my xorg.conf until i just reconfigured it http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/51114/
2008-01-07T23:40:00.000Z	hairulfr	panfist	what is the res you need?
2008-01-07T23:40:00.000Z	hairulfr	panfist	1366x...?
2008-01-07T23:41:00.000Z	panfist	hairulfr	yes 1366 x 768 would be ideal
2008-01-07T23:41:00.000Z	hairulfr	panfist	Was it a tv?
2008-01-07T23:42:00.000Z	panfist	hairulfr	that is correct
2008-01-07T23:46:00.000Z	hairulfr	panfist	Hmm.. Try sudo nvidia-settings
2008-01-07T23:47:00.000Z	hairulfr	panfist	Or just nvidia-settings
2008-01-07T23:47:00.000Z	panfist	hairulfr	i dont think that worked. i got the ability to change like 5 irrelevant options and i got some error messages in the terminal like "unable to detect number of nvidia GPUs"
2008-01-07T23:48:00.000Z	panfist	hairulfr	i guess when i reconfigured xorg it disabled the restricted driver
2008-01-07T23:49:00.000Z	hairulfr	panfist	As far as I can tell you need to set the widescreen options from that, it seems a very common issue with the widescreens,
2008-01-07T23:49:00.000Z	hairulfr	panfist	Well, it should read xorg and list the proper res
