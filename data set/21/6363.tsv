2010-02-19T19:44:00.000Z	magnetron	erUSUL	that's a sysfs, it's created by the kernel on boot-time. it's reset everytime the computer is rebooted. my question is what is writing to that file after reboot
2010-02-19T19:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	magnetron	the default value is in the kernel. just overwritte it in /etc/rc.local like i said
