2007-08-31T07:45:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Jack_Sparrow	do I want the Flag to say Boot? I didnt toggle the Bootable option though..

2007-08-31T07:54:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Jack_Sparrow	one more thing.. if i wanted to add a line to /etc/fstab so that /dev/hdd1 is mounted each time i start the system, what would that line look like? (the path to the end point is /media/stuff)
2007-08-31T07:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CzarAlex	I like to use diskmounter....
2007-08-31T07:55:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Jack_Sparrow	I was hoping to do it via cli.
2007-08-31T07:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CzarAlex	NOt sure how it will handle the newer uuid in fstab though
2007-08-31T07:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CzarAlex	Yes, you can manually mount it..
