2008-12-22T18:41:00.000Z	RizR		chaps. nvidia+dual head with proprietry driver+ubuntu_gnome. how do I maximize window across both monitors?
2008-12-22T18:43:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	RizR	With Compiz?
2008-12-22T18:44:00.000Z	RizR	ushimitsudoki	yes
2008-12-22T18:45:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki		Rizr: In general options, you can set the outputs. By default, it will try to force maximizing to only one monitor
2008-12-22T18:45:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki		Rizr: so you can set it there, or maybe disable Compiz if you want to test it
2008-12-22T18:46:00.000Z	RizR	ushimitsudoki	what's the option in general options?
2008-12-22T18:46:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	RizR	i think it is Display Settings > Outputs.
2008-12-22T18:47:00.000Z	RizR	ushimitsudoki	outputs got 640x480+0+0 which is probably position and size?
2008-12-22T18:48:00.000Z	RizR	ushimitsudoki	what should be the value? My full desktop resolution is 2560x1024
2008-12-22T18:48:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	RizR	right if you uncheck detect outputs it will probably mazimize across both monitors. I just tried it and it worked for me. I did not have to enter the full resolution. Try both, though if one doesn't work
2008-12-22T18:49:00.000Z	RizR	ushimitsudoki	needs X restart?
2008-12-22T18:49:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki		Rizr: i didn't need one
2008-12-22T18:49:00.000Z	RizR	ushimitsudoki	unchecking detect outputs didn't work for me.
2008-12-22T18:50:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki		Rizr: Then try entering the 2560x1025 manually in the outputs section as well
2008-12-22T18:50:00.000Z	RizR	ushimitsudoki	i take that one back. works.
2008-12-22T18:50:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	RizR	Hooray!
2008-12-22T18:51:00.000Z	RizR	ushimitsudoki	cheers :-) one more thing. ideally a separate combination to maximize window across monitors and default action to do it on one. What do you reckon about that?
2008-12-22T18:52:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	RizR	to my knowledge compiz doesn't support that. You can set per-window sizing, but it's not quite the same thing. I tried to get that "maximize" and "REALLY maximize" working once and couldn't find a good solution
2008-12-22T18:54:00.000Z	RizR	ushimitsudoki	gonna try using outputs options. may be get somewhere. cheers for this :-)
2008-12-22T18:56:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	RizR	Good luck .. let me know if you get a clean solution
2008-12-22T18:56:00.000Z	RizR	ushimitsudoki	sure. thanks.
