2009-11-08T04:39:00.000Z	Ruge		I just find it really strange that it just cant detect a VGA monitor in a DVI input, when other OS can... unless ive missed something!
2009-11-08T04:39:00.000Z	penguin42	Ruge	Which graphics cards, Gnome or KDE?
2009-11-08T04:42:00.000Z	penguin42	Ruge	can you get the output of the xrandr command somewhere (e.g. a pastebin) and have you tried another VGA->DVI cable?
2009-11-08T04:43:00.000Z	Ruge	penguin42	whats xrandr?
2009-11-08T04:43:00.000Z	penguin42	Ruge	xrandr is a program that manages the X server resolution settings these days
2009-11-08T04:45:00.000Z	penguin42	Ruge	Tell me a bit more - that says you have 2240x1200 resolution - that sounds great - what have you really got?
2009-11-08T04:47:00.000Z	Ruge	penguin42	Atm, i have 2 CRTs connected to my machine. One has a resolution of 1280x960, the other 1600x1200. However can only see out of the 1600x1200 (that is connected to VGA)
2009-11-08T04:48:00.000Z	penguin42	Ruge	Ah OK, what type of graphics card? also on the monitor that it doesn't get right is it a normal VGA lead at the monitor end?
2009-11-08T04:50:00.000Z	penguin42	Ruge	Does it help if you swap the two monitors?
2009-11-08T04:50:00.000Z	Ruge	penguin42	let me try that now.
2009-11-08T04:54:00.000Z	Ruge	penguin42	sigh, monitor out of frequency
2009-11-08T04:54:00.000Z	penguin42	Ruge	On both of them?
2009-11-08T04:54:00.000Z	Ruge	penguin42	only this display configuration works
2009-11-08T04:55:00.000Z	penguin42	Ruge	My suspicion is that either the DVI->VGA adapter or the CRT monitor you have on that monitor is blocking the EDID signals that let the card figure out the res of the monitor; you'll have to tell it the sync range manually
2009-11-08T04:56:00.000Z	Ruge	penguin42	that could be it, ill just have to learn more about these things.
2009-11-08T04:56:00.000Z	penguin42	Ruge	I have a similar problem in that my external monitor doesn't do EDID for no apparent reason
2009-11-08T04:57:00.000Z	Ruge	penguin42	oh right, still curious how I could get a display last night, but now I cant..
2009-11-08T04:57:00.000Z	penguin42	Ruge	Ah not sure, since it's the nvidia it'll be a bit different from what I used to, since they don't do it the same way as the open source stuff
2009-11-08T04:58:00.000Z	Ruge	penguin42	yeah regretting getting an nVidia card. Their drivers are known to be terrible.
2009-11-08T04:58:00.000Z	penguin42	Ruge	If you want dual head it's nvidia or ati and they're both dodgy
2009-11-08T04:59:00.000Z	Ruge	penguin42	Ive actually encountered this many times, I found that my resolutions pretty much set themselves how they felt like on Ubuntu 9.04 and LinuxMint 7
