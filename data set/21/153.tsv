2012-07-27T22:35:00.000Z	kyconquers	SolarisB1y	oh sorry.
2012-07-27T22:35:00.000Z	SolarisB1y	kyconquers	that error is generally true =)
2012-07-27T22:36:00.000Z	SolarisB1y	kyconquers	what is "it" an NFS mount or Samba or such?
2012-07-27T22:42:00.000Z	kyconquers	SolarisB1y	I am going to turn the source into a dev box so I can share files and things through it as well as proxy through it.
2012-07-27T22:43:00.000Z	SolarisB1y	kyconquers	decide how you want it to work.. do you want the desktop to share files out for the laptops to connect to?
2012-07-27T22:44:00.000Z	kyconquers	SolarisB1y	no I have a dev box just for this and I want to acces a folder on both laptops and my desktop
2012-07-27T22:46:00.000Z	kyconquers	SolarisB1y	mostly music and stuff. but I also want to do word documents (or libbre equivalent)
2012-07-27T22:46:00.000Z	SolarisB1y	kyconquers	what OS are all the systems?
2012-07-27T22:47:00.000Z	SolarisB1y	kyconquers	take a look here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo
2012-07-27T22:48:00.000Z	SolarisB1y	kyconquers	sure - and it takes only a few minutes - no need to over complicate anything =)
2012-07-27T22:49:00.000Z	kyconquers	SolarisB1y	will I be able to use it if I change my dev-box to debian?
2012-07-27T22:51:00.000Z	kyconquers	SolarisB1y	ok that woun't be a problem. thanks again.
2012-07-27T23:20:00.000Z	kyconquers	SolarisB1y	I followed the instructions but am getting a access denied error.
