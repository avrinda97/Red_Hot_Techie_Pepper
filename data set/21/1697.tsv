2010-09-11T10:56:00.000Z	piyushmishra		hi I am trying to make an app launcher. its runs from the terminal can I make some launcher that doesnt need launcher?
2010-09-11T10:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piyushmishra	 clarify what you are trying to launch...
2010-09-11T10:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piyushmishra	  make a laumncher that runs /the/full/path/to/matlab
2010-09-11T10:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piyushmishra	 what closes?
2010-09-11T10:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piyushmishra	 whats the exact command you use in the terminal to run matlab?
2010-09-11T11:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piyushmishra	 perhaops it requiers a terminal to be open.. ive never used it..
2010-09-11T11:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piyushmishra	 you could make the launcher 'open in terminal' or run 'xterm -e matlab'  also..
2010-09-11T11:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piyushmishra	 does 'matlab &' in termnial work? can you then use the 'exit' command?
2010-09-11T11:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piyushmishra	 you can make a script and the launcher can run the script if you wanted.
2010-09-11T11:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piyushmishra	 make a script? bash scripting fundamentals.
2010-09-11T11:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piyushmishra	 example script = 2 lines.. #!/bin/bash     matlab &
2010-09-11T11:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piyushmishra	 but i cant imagine WHY that would work and not running matlib directly
2011-01-21T01:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piyushmishra	 Upgraded sudo how exactly?   I dont see how that would affect X/mouse  tho.
2011-01-21T01:03:00.000Z	piyushmishra	Dr_Willis	it showed up in my upgrade center and I let it upgrade. then I installed sugar from sugarlabs to try. it wasn't broken till then suddenly now it behaves as if alt key is pressed
2011-01-21T01:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piyushmishra	 Its possible sugar did somthing.. but i doubt if sudo did.
2011-01-21T01:04:00.000Z	piyushmishra	Dr_Willis	 I already removed it to check. if it broke something, it hasn't undone it on uninstall :(
2011-01-21T01:05:00.000Z	piyushmishra	Dr_Willis	how do I fix it now?
2011-01-21T01:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piyushmishra	 you may want to add a new user, and test to see if the issue also affects a newly made user
2011-01-21T01:07:00.000Z	piyushmishra	Dr_Willis	isn't there anyway to reset my mouse?
2011-01-21T01:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piyushmishra	see if a new user works.. if so. then its the other users settings that are the issue.. if all users have issues.. then its some system config perhaps.
2011-01-21T01:14:00.000Z	piyushmishra	Dr_Willis	it's the user settings I made a new user and it worked perfectly
