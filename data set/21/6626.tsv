2008-08-13T04:37:00.000Z	Cutter		what's the point of Xubuntu
2008-08-13T04:37:00.000Z	Cutter		?
2008-08-13T04:38:00.000Z	Cutter		it's still about 2 times slower than XP
2008-08-13T04:38:00.000Z	Cutter		if I had o decent comp I would install Ubuntu
2008-08-13T04:38:00.000Z	Cutter		because I have a crappy one I must install XP
2008-08-13T04:39:00.000Z	Cutter		Xubuntu was a nightmare
2008-08-13T04:40:00.000Z	Cutter		XP runs almost well
2008-08-13T04:41:00.000Z	Cutter		Xubuntu is too close to the two tohers
2008-08-13T04:41:00.000Z	Cutter		in terms of system reqs
2008-08-13T04:41:00.000Z	crdlb	Cutter	there is
2008-08-13T04:42:00.000Z	Cutter		but it's not official
2008-08-13T04:42:00.000Z	crdlb		and it's not as if you can't install whatever window manager you want
2008-08-13T04:42:00.000Z	Cutter		I'm talking about canonical's strategy
2008-08-13T04:42:00.000Z	Cutter		Ubuntu would touch a broader audience with a very lightweight Ubuntu edition
2008-08-13T04:43:00.000Z	Cutter		Xubuntu doesn't fill this requirement of a lightweight distrib
2008-08-13T04:44:00.000Z	Cutter		btw how much RAM does Linux support?
2008-08-13T04:44:00.000Z	Cutter		Windows 32 bit supports about 3Gb I think
2008-08-13T04:45:00.000Z	Cutter	pajamian	are there a "server" and a "desktop" kernel?
2008-08-13T04:46:00.000Z	Cutter		I thought the kernel was a common part to all distribs
2008-08-13T04:46:00.000Z	crdlb	Cutter	it's just configured differently
2008-08-13T04:47:00.000Z	crdlb	Cutter	optimized for throughput instead of latency, etc
