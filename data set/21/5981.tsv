2007-06-25T12:29:00.000Z	jetole_		hey guys
2007-06-25T12:30:00.000Z	jetole_		thanks bot and owner
2007-06-25T12:30:00.000Z	jetole_		lol
2007-06-25T12:30:00.000Z	jetole_		well that just cheered me up a little
2007-06-25T12:31:00.000Z	jetole_		has anyone been able to get java (from any company) to work in 64bit firefox?
2007-06-25T12:33:00.000Z	jetole_		not a xterm in X
2007-06-25T12:35:00.000Z	jetole_		oh...
2007-06-25T12:35:00.000Z	jetole_		well at least to get a remote desktop I did
2007-06-25T12:36:00.000Z	jetole_		change to a terminal screen and type => startx ssh -X server.x.y.z gnome-session -- :1
2007-06-25T12:36:00.000Z	jetole_		so no one on here has java working for 64 bit firefox?
2007-06-25T12:36:00.000Z	bruenig	jetole_	few people use 64 bit, it is kind of pointless
2007-06-25T12:37:00.000Z	jetole_	bruenig	why?
2007-06-25T12:37:00.000Z	bruenig	jetole_	what is the point of using it?
2007-06-25T12:38:00.000Z	jetole_	bruenig	because 64 bit processing is faster then 32bit by using larger data paths and performing higher math computations per cpu cycle
2007-06-25T12:38:00.000Z	bruenig	jetole_	it is very small
2007-06-25T12:38:00.000Z	bruenig	jetole_	at least as it is applied now
2007-06-25T12:39:00.000Z	bruenig	jetole_	certainly theoretically it is far better, but no one really takes advantage of it so you don't get much boost
2007-06-25T12:39:00.000Z	jetole_	bruenig	java is the only thing not working on this at the moment and on my 32 bit installation on a 64 bit server I own there are a few apps I am having trouble with
2007-06-25T12:39:00.000Z	bruenig	jetole_	well for server maybe
2007-06-25T12:40:00.000Z	bruenig	jetole_	for desktop computing, I couldn't tell any difference
2007-06-25T12:41:00.000Z	jetole_	bruenig	the difference is there, If I compile two hello worlds against 64bit and 32bit apps the difference is there, but that aside, there are more apps I could not run with 32bit on a 64bit
