2007-04-18T13:53:00.000Z	jlist		hi all, i have a question - from command line, is there a way to tell that i'm on ubuntu, and not other distros like redhat, suse, etc.?
2007-04-18T13:54:00.000Z	my_haz	jlist	heh, that seems like such a simple question, but i can't think of a way to do it off the top of my head
2007-04-18T13:56:00.000Z	my_haz	jlist	for the record "gcc --version" tends to show that info
2007-04-18T13:56:00.000Z	jlist	my_haz	you are right. But on some of them, gcc is not installed
2007-04-18T13:57:00.000Z	my_haz	jlist	word, i am always a bit suprised not to find gcc on a UNIX box :-{
2007-04-18T13:58:00.000Z	jlist	my_haz	i'm on a solaris box that doesn't have gcc :)
2007-04-18T13:59:00.000Z	my_haz	jlist	to quote pinkfloyd suprise, suprise supries
2007-04-18T13:59:00.000Z	jlist	my_haz	ubuntu doesn't have it unless i install build-essential, or am i wrong?
2007-04-18T14:00:00.000Z	my_haz	jlist	no you are right
2007-04-18T14:00:00.000Z	my_haz	jlist	which as always bothered me
2007-04-18T14:00:00.000Z	jlist	my_haz	yeah. not sure why that decision. security?
2007-04-18T14:01:00.000Z	my_haz	jlist	but then again i am doing the LTS, thing so i don't have to reinstall for like 5 years
2007-04-18T14:01:00.000Z	my_haz	jlist	i dunno, they are just wacky
2007-04-18T14:01:00.000Z	jlist	my_haz	good for you :) i'm not quite understanding the LTS thing though. You'd rather run an older version?
2007-04-18T14:03:00.000Z	my_haz	jlist	well i tend to customize my box to high-hell, so reinstalls are a big long deal for me, so its better to wait a few months to get the latest and the greatest. The only big draw back i have found so far is not being able to add from apt, Python2.5, but meh, i can wait
2007-04-18T14:05:00.000Z	jlist	my_haz	having to reinstall every 6 months is always a pain. The upgrading from one version to another version w/o reinstalling didn't work well last time i tried
2007-04-18T14:06:00.000Z	jlist	my_haz	this is actually more annoying on linux than on windows. On windows, at least i don't have to reinstall for the last few years
2007-04-18T14:06:00.000Z	my_haz	jlist	it was uneventful for me, i tend to wait to do that too, so most of the buggs are worked out. Ya i know, i am a wuss.
2007-04-18T14:06:00.000Z	my_haz	jlist	i dunno jack about windows
2007-04-18T14:07:00.000Z	my_haz	jlist	basically, and then detache with C-d
2007-04-18T14:07:00.000Z	jlist	my_haz	sent your last msg to the wrong id?
