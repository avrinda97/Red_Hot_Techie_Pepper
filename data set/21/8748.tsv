2006-03-20T07:23:00.000Z	Cyorxamp		Hi folks, I just installed swat on my ubuntu machine and I can't seem to access localhost:901 (where its supposed to be) I have checked the services file and it looks ok - any ideas!?

2006-03-20T07:25:00.000Z	redguy|work	Cyorxamp	/etc/inetd.conf?
2006-03-20T07:27:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	redguy|work	- "#<off># swat  stream tcp nowait.400 root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/swat"  in that file
2006-03-20T07:27:00.000Z	redguy|work	Cyorxamp	well, uncomment that line
2006-03-20T07:28:00.000Z	redguy|work	Cyorxamp	you might need to restart inetd for the change to have effect
2006-03-20T07:28:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	redguy|work	is there a quick way of restarting services?
2006-03-20T07:29:00.000Z	redguy|work	Cyorxamp	the proper way would be invoke-rc.d inetd restart.
2006-03-20T07:29:00.000Z	redguy|work	Cyorxamp	you could also do it wit /etc/init.d/inetd restart
2006-03-20T07:30:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	redguy|work	command not found
2006-03-20T07:30:00.000Z	redguy|work	Cyorxamp	invoke-rc.d ??
2006-03-20T07:30:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	redguy|work	either of them
2006-03-20T07:31:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	redguy|work	invoke-rc.d says it cant find script /etc/init.d/inetd and also inetd does not exist there
2006-03-20T07:32:00.000Z	redguy|work	Cyorxamp	hmmm, that's odd
2006-03-20T07:32:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	redguy|work	I am getting it using apt-get
2006-03-20T07:33:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	redguy|work	all works now - thanx!
2006-03-20T07:33:00.000Z	redguy|work	Cyorxamp	cool, odd that you didn't have inetd installed by default
2006-03-20T07:34:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	redguy|work	well this is a new 'server' ubuntu install with xubuntu (basically the xfce desktop environment) put on top
2006-03-20T07:36:00.000Z	redguy|work	Cyorxamp	still, I find it odd. Propably nothing to worry about though
2006-03-20T08:18:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	redguy|work	wow... thats bollox - why on earth do that!
2006-03-20T08:19:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	redguy|work	surely I use my root password when sudo-ing ?
