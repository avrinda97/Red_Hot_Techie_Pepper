2006-06-27T12:46:00.000Z	Znortfl		Hey, anybody got a clue on how to use an iPod on ubuntu breezy?
2006-06-27T12:47:00.000Z	Znortfl		thanks wastrel
2006-06-27T12:48:00.000Z	bleaked	Znortfl	what do you need to know about pods?
2006-06-27T12:48:00.000Z	Znortfl	bleaked	I'd like to play music on my new iPod nano, by using my linux pc to get files on it
2006-06-27T12:49:00.000Z	bleaked	Znortfl	well, i use kde, so there's a nice kio-slave that automounts it, and the media player amaroK has full ipod support.  unfortunately in gnome, the options are, IMHO, are piss-poor.
2006-06-27T12:50:00.000Z	Znortfl	bleaked	so I cant run amaroK in gnome?
2006-06-27T12:51:00.000Z	bleaked	Znortfl	another option, would be what i did: install rockbox (an alternative firmware for various media players) onto my ipod and i just use amarok to dump songs on..otherwise one could just drag and drop into /dev/sda2
2006-06-27T12:51:00.000Z	bleaked	Znortfl	no, you can use amarok..you just can't use the nice kio-slave
2006-06-27T12:52:00.000Z	bleaked	Znortfl	but you can tell amarok to mount it, using a pre-connect command
2006-06-27T12:52:00.000Z	Znortfl	bleaked	I dont think dumping my songs on /media/ipod will work
2006-06-27T12:54:00.000Z	bleaked	Znortfl	well, not with the apple firmware, since that only reads from a lame database and puts the songs into obfusticated folders and filenames -- but rockbox reads straight up.  amarok works well though, it will write to the iTunesDB, and you can even extract songs off of it as well -- don't even bother with gtkpod, it's a terrible app.
2006-06-27T12:55:00.000Z	Znortfl	bleaked	yes, I discovered that myself about half an hour ago
2006-06-27T12:57:00.000Z	bleaked	Znortfl	but look into rockbox: supports pretty much every format (ogg/flac/mp3/etc), gapless playback (the apple firmware skips in between tracks), crossfading, games, skins, and so much more.  by default, you install it as a dual-boot, but eventually i found myself never using the apple firmware, so i dumped it, gained 65MB, and reduced boot time down to about 1 second.  now i can play all of my oggs on my nano :D
2006-06-27T12:58:00.000Z	Znortfl	bleaked	How do I tell AmaroK to contact the ipod?
2006-06-27T13:00:00.000Z	bleaked	Znortfl	not sure, might need to be mounted.  in kde, it's autodetected by the kio-slave, and amarok asks you if you want to use the device.  i think you'll have to manually mount /dev/sda2, and tell amarok it's there.
2006-06-27T13:01:00.000Z	Znortfl	bleaked	how do I tell amaroK that it's there, sorry im sucha complete newb
2006-06-27T13:02:00.000Z	Znortfl	bleaked	I have found the screen that asks for the mount command, but the ipod is automatically mounted, so it doesnt need to be mounted
2006-06-27T13:04:00.000Z	bleaked	Znortfl	if it's already mounted, i believe amarok should find it, or you should be able to point it to it..
2006-06-27T13:05:00.000Z	bleaked	Znortfl	i really can't help you now though..i just b0rked my system, and i'm stuck in a recovery shell and really should focus on that instead of assisting people w/ their ipods..but later though, i'd be happy to help..
2006-06-27T13:05:00.000Z	bleaked	Znortfl	sorry.. :\
2006-06-27T13:05:00.000Z	Znortfl	bleaked	I understand, this is more important ofc ;)
