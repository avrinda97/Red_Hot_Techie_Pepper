2009-05-12T09:17:00.000Z	madcompg33k		so I try sudo apt-get install httpd and get a list of similar-sounding httpd's (like thttpd, or lighthttpd, or...bozohttpd) ...but no just httpd...am I supposed to choose one of those or is there something missing and the install httpd should work maybe?
2009-05-12T09:18:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	madcompg33k	i think its apache
2009-05-12T09:19:00.000Z	madcompg33k	Hiemanshu	so if I installed apache earlier today and it seems to be working (I can see a page in my browser if I try) ...I 'should' have httpd right? can't seem to find any folders though with conf stuff for httpd
2009-05-12T09:19:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	madcompg33k	httpd is apache
2009-05-12T09:20:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	madcompg33k	it should be /var/www/html
2009-05-12T09:20:00.000Z	madcompg33k	Hiemanshu	yeah that's there too ^_^ but I was reading something about trying to setup virtual hosting and it wanted me (the guide online) to do something at /srv/something and nothing there, is that just an old guide maybe?
2009-05-12T09:21:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	madcompg33k	you need to add virtualhosts to apache.conf then
2009-05-12T09:22:00.000Z	madcompg33k	Hiemanshu	kk, I'll give that a shot, ty for the info ^_^ ...one last quick thing ^_^ ...I previously setup apache/php/mysql on windows, and just as I was expecting, there's like say...www/ and then in that room for other folders (like say cgi-bin or templates or whatever) and public_html and all the browser referal stuff automatically directs to public_html ...is that already setup in default apache/php stuff or is that something I ha
2009-05-12T09:23:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	madcompg33k	as i said you need to setup virtualhosts to do it :)
2009-05-12T09:23:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	madcompg33k	why not install a control panel and have them do it for you?
2009-05-12T09:23:00.000Z	madcompg33k	Hiemanshu	kk, ty again for all the help ^_^ really appreciate it
2009-05-12T09:23:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	madcompg33k	try webmin :)
2009-05-12T09:24:00.000Z	madcompg33k	Hiemanshu	...how do I do that? ^_^ like in ubuntu itself? not sure really...I'll look webmin up though and see what I can find ^_^ /bow
2009-05-12T09:24:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	madcompg33k	yes on ubuntu you can install
2009-05-12T09:25:00.000Z	madcompg33k	Hiemanshu	kk, kewl ^_^ ty again for all the info =^_^=
2009-05-12T09:25:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	madcompg33k	no probs
2009-05-12T10:39:00.000Z	madcompg33k	Hiemanshu	(in case you're there...or anyone else who may know the answer ^_^) so I installed webmin, tried going to https://localhost:10000 and it says localhost:10000 uses an invalid security certificate. The certificate is is not trusted because it is self signed. (Error code: sec_error_untrusted_issuer)
2009-05-12T10:39:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	madcompg33k	just accept it
2009-05-12T10:39:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	madcompg33k	add an expection
2009-05-12T10:40:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	madcompg33k	its your own server so you can trust that thing dont worry
2009-05-12T10:42:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	madcompg33k	no problem
