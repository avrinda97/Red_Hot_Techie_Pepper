2008-09-13T23:20:00.000Z	amenado		outofthemadness-> how did you manage to mount that external partition?
2008-09-13T23:21:00.000Z	amenado		outofthemadness-> do this,  cat /etc/fstab;  mount   and paste the results in pastebin
2008-09-13T23:22:00.000Z	amenado		outofthemadness-> lest you have modified udev to mount partitions by anyone, then only root can mount them
2008-09-13T23:23:00.000Z	amenado		outofthemadness-> what i meant by that, is learn the /etc/udev/rules.d/*.rules to figure out the perms during mouting
2008-09-13T23:24:00.000Z	amenado		tolecnal-> repeat that again.. libjli.so ?   is that a typo?
2008-09-13T23:24:00.000Z	tolecnal	amenado	no, it's not a type
2008-09-13T23:28:00.000Z	tolecnal	amenado	http://pastebin.com/m1b1b07f0
2008-09-13T23:32:00.000Z	tolecnal	amenado	well, since it can't find the shared library it fails to do anything
2008-09-13T23:32:00.000Z	tolecnal	amenado	aptitude install sun-java5-bin
2008-09-13T23:35:00.000Z	tolecnal	amenado	tried that, fails too. and yes, I'm sure it's sun-java5-bin I want
2008-09-13T23:35:00.000Z	tolecnal	amenado	http://pastebin.com/m6f8f4d1
2008-09-13T23:38:00.000Z	tolecnal	amenado	fails too :/
2008-09-13T23:42:00.000Z	tolecnal	amenado	what's really strange is the fact that the library file that it tries to load is in the package being installed. so I can't understand why it fails in the first place.
2008-09-13T23:44:00.000Z	tolecnal	amenado	could you bother trying to install the package yourself to see if it installs on your side please?
2008-09-13T23:46:00.000Z	tolecnal	amenado	Java Version 1.5.0 gij
2008-09-13T23:49:00.000Z	tolecnal	amenado	I'll have to try that afterwards. dinner's ready. thanks for your input
