2004-10-20T12:28:00.000Z	tck		its worth it for such a good os
2004-10-20T12:28:00.000Z	tck		wait till next year, ubuntu will be up there with the rest
2004-10-20T12:28:00.000Z	tck		i'm surprised linuxiso.org doesnt have it up yet :P
2004-10-20T12:04:00.000Z	tck		i get an applet error upon entering the gnome desktop
2004-10-20T12:04:00.000Z	tck		"Unable to acquire the monitor of the Trash directory."
2004-10-20T12:05:00.000Z	tck		and the trash applet has disappeared ; any suggestions?
2004-10-20T12:05:00.000Z	|trey|	tck	put it back?
2004-10-20T12:05:00.000Z	|trey|	tck	right click panel > add to panel  :)
2004-10-22T08:59:00.000Z	|trey|	tck	ugh, thats irssi... not using it here currently...
2004-10-22T09:07:00.000Z	|trey|	tck	at least its narrowed down pretty well... sys sound works, gnome sound (for that user) does not.
2004-10-22T09:08:00.000Z	|trey|	tck	trying wargames = make everyone who cares go look to find out how wargames accesses sound  :/
2004-10-22T09:09:00.000Z	|trey|	tck	*coughmplayerisgodcough*
2004-10-22T09:10:00.000Z	|trey|	tck	already added marillats sources?
2004-10-22T09:11:00.000Z	|trey|	tck	then you need to make a detour to apt-get.org
2004-10-22T09:13:00.000Z	|trey|	tck	search for "mplayer-nogui" and add the one that states "marillat" and "nerim" to your sources.list
2004-10-22T09:15:00.000Z	|trey|	tck	don't message me
2004-10-22T09:15:00.000Z	|trey|	tck	didn't even look at it, you want the one that states "sid" as its distrib
2004-10-22T09:19:00.000Z	|trey|	tck	the filesystem type has nothing to do with gnome... gnome just looks at the filesystem in its current state, and any remote filesystems it has access to, and displays them to the user in a logical mannor...
2004-10-22T09:19:00.000Z	tck	|trey|	: just automation is a handy feature, such as say drakloop for mdk
2004-10-22T09:21:00.000Z	|trey|	tck	umm, ubuntu is working on automation via python (why do you think there are about 30-40 python packages?)
2004-10-22T09:21:00.000Z	|trey|	tck	Ubuntu just needs to develop some front ends, it will take time...
