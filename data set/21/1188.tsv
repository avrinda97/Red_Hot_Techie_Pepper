2011-02-05T20:27:00.000Z	chouchou		hello, pls I am trying to install python and thi sis what I have
2011-02-05T20:27:00.000Z	schnuffle1	chouchou	python should be installed by default
2011-02-05T20:28:00.000Z	schnuffle1	chouchou	open a terminal and enter python
2011-02-05T20:28:00.000Z	schnuffle1	chouchou	what happens, do you get a python prompt?
2011-02-05T20:29:00.000Z	schnuffle1	chouchou	so you have python installed
2011-02-05T20:30:00.000Z	schnuffle1	chouchou	so you wrote a script importing the gtk and it said not available?
2011-02-05T20:30:00.000Z	schnuffle1	chouchou	I prefer much more the Qt bindings but thats personal preference
2011-02-05T20:31:00.000Z	chouchou	schnuffle1	please have a look at this . you might have a better understanding
2011-02-05T20:33:00.000Z	schnuffle1	chouchou	oay you have a project to do but I still cn't figure where your problem is
2011-02-05T20:35:00.000Z	chouchou	schnuffle1	I first thought I will create a cron job as well as a programm start up option setting
2011-02-05T20:36:00.000Z	schnuffle1	chouchou	what means you installed mini server to your desktop
2011-02-05T20:37:00.000Z	chouchou	schnuffle1	currently I have ubuntu running on vmware, I am trying to test what I am doing. what do you mean by a mini server?
2011-02-05T20:38:00.000Z	schnuffle1	chouchou	I want to be able to login to the unix mini server on my unbuntu free software (server)
2011-02-05T20:38:00.000Z	schnuffle1	chouchou	there are tools like webmin to administer your server
2011-02-05T20:39:00.000Z	schnuffle1	chouchou	fxconsults is a web app?
2011-02-05T20:40:00.000Z	chouchou	schnuffle1	I learnt webmin is like cpanel right?
2011-02-05T20:40:00.000Z	schnuffle1	chouchou	yes a bit like that, so you want people to login to your server, which protocoll should they use? SSH, telnet ....
2011-02-05T20:42:00.000Z	chouchou	schnuffle1	probably, SSH or web interface, because he said it will be installed on his ubuntu PC
2011-02-05T20:42:00.000Z	schnuffle1	chouchou	You should sort out a more precise plan of what you want to achieve
2011-02-05T20:43:00.000Z	chouchou	schnuffle1	I think webmin will do the job
2011-02-05T20:44:00.000Z	schnuffle1	chouchou	I second that, if youll in charge learn your way around the console
