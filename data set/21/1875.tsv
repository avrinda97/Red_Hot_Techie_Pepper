2011-01-24T20:09:00.000Z	AbuBadr		hi there, Is there a software to control startup programs?
2011-01-24T20:10:00.000Z	red2kic	AbuBadr	System --> Pref --> Startup Apps
2011-01-24T20:11:00.000Z	AbuBadr	red2kic	I tried that way but I can't find emesene?!
2011-01-24T20:12:00.000Z	red2kic	AbuBadr	/etc/xdg/autostart <-- Check that.
2011-01-24T20:16:00.000Z	AbuBadr	red2kic	didn't find emesene there!
2011-01-24T20:17:00.000Z	red2kic	AbuBadr	emesene starts up and you want to turn that off?
2011-01-24T20:18:00.000Z	AbuBadr	red2kic	no, I want emesene to start with ubuntu startup
2011-01-24T20:19:00.000Z	red2kic	AbuBadr	Oh. Create a file in System --> Startup Apps --> Add.
2011-01-24T20:19:00.000Z	red2kic	AbuBadr	I thought you're trying to remove emense and couldn't find the file.
2011-01-24T20:20:00.000Z	AbuBadr	red2kic	I tried to add emesene but I can't find it!
2011-01-24T20:21:00.000Z	red2kic	AbuBadr	"which emesene" -- That's where the command is.
2011-01-24T20:23:00.000Z	AbuBadr	red2kic	wow thanks alot
2011-01-24T20:23:00.000Z	red2kic	AbuBadr	No prob.
2011-01-24T20:54:00.000Z	red2kic	AbuBadr	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
2011-01-24T20:55:00.000Z	red2kic	AbuBadr	When you're done, close it. Run "update-grub2" -- Hopefully it'll work. La la la.
2011-01-24T20:55:00.000Z	AbuBadr	red2kic	i have this line        GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
2011-01-24T20:56:00.000Z	red2kic	AbuBadr	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash acpi=off"
2011-01-24T20:57:00.000Z	AbuBadr	red2kic	ActionParsnip, update-grub  or  update-grub2  ??
2011-01-24T20:57:00.000Z	red2kic	AbuBadr	You pick.
2011-01-24T20:58:00.000Z	AbuBadr	red2kic	ActionParsnip, thanks but how come grub is read only!! i can't type there!
2011-01-24T20:59:00.000Z	red2kic	AbuBadr	Permissions. That file are not meant to be tampered religiously.
