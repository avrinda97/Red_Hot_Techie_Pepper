2012-08-21T02:15:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	wilee-nilee	I can't seem to get in the grub menu… Aren't I supposed to hold the shift key down when I see my motherboard screen to load the grub menu?
2012-08-21T02:16:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	coldpizza72i	should yes if you have only one OS, and you have not changed the timeout.
2012-08-21T02:16:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	wilee-nilee	timeout?
2012-08-21T02:17:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	coldpizza72i	grub has a time out that is the time you have to use it before it boots.
2012-08-21T02:17:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	wilee-nilee	perhaps I should use a live cd to get the grub menu to stick at boot
2012-08-21T02:18:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	coldpizza72i	What happened or what did you do that removed the graphics driver or make you think you had?
2012-08-21T02:19:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	wilee-nilee	I put fglrx then wanted to switch back to the default one
2012-08-21T02:20:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	coldpizza72i	I think you want help from someone more familiar with that stuff, my answer originally was just a easier method then using the cd.
2012-08-21T02:22:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	coldpizza72i	Is this a install from windows perchance?
2012-08-21T02:23:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	wilee-nilee	…Iv had ubuntu for a while, I was having problems booting today for some reason
2012-08-21T02:23:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	coldpizza72i	But can you actually answer the question?
2012-08-21T02:29:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	wilee-nilee	the answer is no
2012-08-21T02:30:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	coldpizza72i	ah cool thanks, I was just wondering on that in regards to know grub, others are going to be more helpful than me here.
2012-08-21T03:09:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	wilee-nilee	you there?
2012-08-21T03:09:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	coldpizza72i	yeah.
2012-08-21T03:10:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	wilee-nilee	i just got into grub, what should i do again? enter recover mode?
2012-08-21T03:11:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	coldpizza72i	That was my idea as far as a easier then the cd method at messing with the graphics WHICH I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.
2012-08-21T03:11:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	wilee-nilee	and what do i do in recovry mode
2012-08-21T03:14:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	coldpizza72i	You wanted to reload the graphics. You asked if from the cd was possible or best. My only remark was from a recovert terminal would be easier then having to chroot from a cd, That is where it ends as far as I know. Do you understand this, you can't just throw commands at the install from a cd without getting into the install a method used is called a chroot. I can't really help you.
2012-08-21T03:14:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	wilee-nilee	I'm no longer using a cd
