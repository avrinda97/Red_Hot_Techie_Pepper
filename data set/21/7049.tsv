2006-12-09T06:05:00.000Z	genben		hi, i want to install ubuntu_edgy_server version but want to know if it will come with all libs, even tho' it has no X?
2006-12-09T06:06:00.000Z	jrib	genben	"all the libs" ?  what libs?
2006-12-09T06:08:00.000Z	jrib	genben	no, but why would you want them on a server with no X?   You can install X later if you want, then you would get them
2006-12-09T06:08:00.000Z	genben	jrib	there are a few app i needs that depend on X11 unfortunately
2006-12-09T06:08:00.000Z	jrib	genben	what apps?
2006-12-09T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	genben	well when you install with apt, it will pull in whatever you need
2006-12-09T06:12:00.000Z	genben	jrib	can't remember but is to do with rails + mongrel + nginx etc
2006-12-09T06:13:00.000Z	jrib	genben	well whatever is available to the desktop is available to the server, they use the same repository
2006-12-14T08:32:00.000Z	jrib	genben	aptitude search '~smultiverse'     is that what you are looing for?
2006-12-14T08:32:00.000Z	genben	jrib	ta
2006-12-14T08:33:00.000Z	jrib	genben	I believe there is some way to use synaptic too
2006-12-14T08:34:00.000Z	jrib	genben	http://people.debian.org/~dburrows/aptitude-doc/en/ch02s03.html  by the way so you don't think I just picked it out of thin air :)
