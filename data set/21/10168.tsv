2010-08-02T08:39:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	sda1 has 500 mb/1.46 gb
2010-08-02T08:34:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	yes, but i'd like to keep my windows 7 partition if possible
2010-08-02T08:35:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	correct, but i have 2 usb drives which i can use to burn OS's
2010-08-02T08:35:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	except windows 7 of course
2010-08-02T08:52:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	yes
2010-08-02T08:52:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	correct. i was able to delete the swap partitions now.
2010-08-02T08:57:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	unetbootin is exactly what i've been using, thankfully
2010-08-02T09:01:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	apparently backtrack uses grub 1. should installing grub 2 afterwards make things easier?
2010-08-02T09:02:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	what if you install a grub2 os on top of a grub1 os though?
2010-08-02T10:30:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	this time i installed backtrack then ubuntu
2010-08-02T10:58:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	ok, so they should say UUID=/dev/sda7 and UUID=/dev/sda8?
2010-08-02T11:01:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	hda2? or should it be sda?
2010-08-02T11:03:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	so if mine says ext4 i should leave it as ext4?
2010-08-02T11:04:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	oh...so i shouldn't have changed anything else?
2010-08-02T11:14:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	sigh, tried that, exact same error
2010-08-02T11:15:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	just says /dev/disk/by-uuid/the uuid does not exist
2010-08-02T11:17:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	i found this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=987243
2010-08-02T11:27:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	well, good news and bad news
2010-08-02T11:28:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	bad news is that it takes about 6 minutes to boot
2010-08-02T11:31:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	i added 130, but it sure seemed far longer than 130 seconds
2010-08-02T12:11:00.000Z	spine	wiesshund	however, interestingly, there seems to be a very long boot time difference between 90 and 120 for some reason
