2008-12-06T17:55:00.000Z	vitaliy_		hey guys when i try to run my updates i get the following : http://pastebin.com/m1fa71150, i am new to linux any suggestions?
2008-12-06T17:56:00.000Z	tiyowan	vitaliy_	That happened to me yesterday. I d/l'ed a package...Google Earth I think, and closed it while it was running.
2008-12-06T17:57:00.000Z	vitaliy_	tiyowan	so pkill googleearth?
2008-12-06T17:57:00.000Z	tiyowan	vitaliy_	Did you dpkg --configure -a?
2008-12-06T17:57:00.000Z	tiyowan	vitaliy_	Open up a terminal window, and type dpkg --configure -a.
2008-12-06T17:59:00.000Z	tiyowan	vitaliy_	So if dpkg is complaining, it usually means that something interrupted the package from installing. At least, I think so.
2008-12-06T18:01:00.000Z	vitaliy_	tiyowan	thnx it worked but it says that i have one broken package now.
2008-12-06T18:02:00.000Z	tiyowan	vitaliy_	Ok, what is the name of the package?
2008-12-06T18:04:00.000Z	vitaliy_	tiyowan	one sec let me restart x
2008-12-06T18:04:00.000Z	tiyowan	vitaliy_	Ok...hmm. Try running "sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt_get clean"
2008-12-06T18:05:00.000Z	tiyowan	vitaliy_	That should remove the broken package and clean things up. If you have troubles updating your system after that, then just use "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade"
2008-12-06T18:13:00.000Z	vitaliy_	tiyowan	k what do i do now, it doesnot tell me the package that is broken
2008-12-06T18:14:00.000Z	tiyowan	vitaliy_	You do nothing, my good man. :-) Problem should be gone.
2008-12-06T18:14:00.000Z	vitaliy_	tiyowan	?
2008-12-06T18:18:00.000Z	tiyowan	vitaliy_	Could you pastebin the results of your dpkg --configure -a cmd please?
2008-12-06T18:22:00.000Z	tiyowan	vitaliy_	This is what you get when you run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a'?
2008-12-06T18:22:00.000Z	vitaliy_	tiyowan	with cmd
2008-12-06T18:23:00.000Z	vitaliy_	tiyowan	this command i already know it did fix the packages but now it starts to update but it says that one of the packages are courapted
2008-12-06T18:24:00.000Z	tiyowan	vitaliy_	Could you tell us the precise error msg about the package corruption?
2008-12-06T18:28:00.000Z	tiyowan	vitaliy_	Oh okay. :-) I know. Go to System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager. Then click on the Custom Filter button and select Broken from the list above. That should list the broken package. Uncheck the tick next to its name, and click the Apply button.
2008-12-06T18:31:00.000Z	tiyowan	vitaliy_	np. Which package was broken?
