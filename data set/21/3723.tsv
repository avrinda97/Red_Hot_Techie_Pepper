2008-11-26T14:59:00.000Z	neeto		My sound is crackling a little bit. Does anyone think this could be something besides hardware?
2008-11-26T15:00:00.000Z	geenome	neeto	is it a sblive card?
2008-11-26T15:00:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	: I can't remember exactly what it is, let me lshw real quick
2008-11-26T15:02:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	I see :/ it's weird because it didn't used to crackle at all
2008-11-26T15:03:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	it's an SB Audigy LS speficially...
2008-11-26T15:04:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	I haven't upgraded yet, still 8.04
2008-11-26T15:04:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	that's work, nan
2008-11-26T15:05:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	ah, good to know... once I get around to a place where I can upgrade without the danger of losing my data, then I will... I gotta offload about 4TB of crap first though
2008-11-26T15:05:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	it's worked absolutely perfectly since 7.04 when I got this machine
2008-11-26T15:05:00.000Z	geenome	neeto	I suggest partitioning up your hd
2008-11-26T15:06:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	yeah I am gonna do a whole bunch of stuff when I upgrade... get more storage and raid6 it all for redundancy and speed
2008-11-26T15:07:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	I like it, I didn't do anything with it on this install because this machine is a modular experiment of sorts, so it's been being added onto for a year or so
2008-11-26T15:08:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	a huge experiment?
2008-11-26T15:09:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	as soon as I get the time I'll upgrade for sure
2008-11-26T15:09:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	My machine already puts XP to shame several times over. I love this beast
2008-11-26T15:10:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	oh shit they have a gdi mode now
2008-11-26T15:12:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	cool. For now I think I am gonna make ALSA use my intel audio card, that'll probably fix the problem, at least for the immediate future
2008-11-26T15:13:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	cool, should work, although I am more confused about why my creative card decided to get crappy all the sudden more than the fact that it's hard to listen to music with
2008-11-26T15:14:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	I hate when they upgrade working things into non-working things :/
2008-11-26T15:14:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	I do them every chance I get
2008-11-26T15:14:00.000Z	neeto	geenome	I'll cross my fingers... I'm peacin' out for now though
