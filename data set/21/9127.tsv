2005-11-10T17:18:00.000Z	mc|amb		how can I check if the nvidia driver is installed and working??
2005-11-10T17:18:00.000Z	mustard5	mc|amb	a big splash screen with nvidia logo comes up when installed at boot up
2005-11-10T17:19:00.000Z	mc|amb	mustard5	the logo comes up, but i ran a little game (tux racer or something like that) to check it, and it was ver very slow
2005-11-10T17:20:00.000Z	mc|amb	mustard5	any idea of whats going on?
2005-11-10T17:20:00.000Z	mustard5	mc|amb	where did you install the drivers from?
2005-11-10T17:21:00.000Z	mc|amb	mustard5	in the help guide that comes with ubuntu.
2005-11-10T17:22:00.000Z	mustard5	mc|amb	nvidia-glx drivers I take it...they should work fine..so I'm not sure really
2005-11-10T17:22:00.000Z	mustard5	mc|amb	Sanne's hint was a good one
2005-11-10T17:22:00.000Z	mustard5	mc|amb	Sanne said to lsmod | grep nvidia
2005-11-10T17:23:00.000Z	mc|amb	mustard5	i'll try it
2005-11-10T17:25:00.000Z	mc|amb	mustard5	 lsmod | grep nvidia   gives me      nvidia               3711364  12
2005-11-10T17:25:00.000Z	mc|amb		agpgart                32328  2 nvidia,via_agp
2005-11-10T17:25:00.000Z	mc|amb	mustard5	what does that mean?
2005-11-10T17:25:00.000Z	mustard5	mc|amb	that would indicate that they are loaded I would say
2005-11-10T17:26:00.000Z	mc|amb	mustard5	erUSUL_, thanks
2005-11-10T17:28:00.000Z	mc|amb	mustard5	I was curious because the way i've always installed the driver i had to download it from nvidia's web site and a lot of other thigs
2005-11-10T17:28:00.000Z	mc|amb	mustard5	what do you think?
2005-11-10T17:29:00.000Z	mustard5	mc|amb	the nvidia-glx drivers in synaptic support hardware acceleration so I would think they would work
2005-11-10T17:30:00.000Z	mustard5	mc|amb	if you think that they are not doing so then you can get the nvidia drivers from the nvidia site if you feel so inclined
2005-11-10T17:30:00.000Z	mc|amb	mustard5	ill try theese , thanks for your time
2005-11-10T17:30:00.000Z	mustard5	mc|amb	ok
