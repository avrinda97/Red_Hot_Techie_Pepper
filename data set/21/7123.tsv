2007-01-08T10:01:00.000Z	Vigo		Hiya
2007-01-08T10:03:00.000Z	Vigo		If I put windows on Drive (x) wich I did, can I just burn another ISO and install or use the GRUB to repair a previous install?
2007-01-08T10:05:00.000Z	Vigo		Apologies Lexx: did not see your Q?
2007-01-08T10:06:00.000Z	lexx	Vigo	Yeah, it just wont install, I have tried lots of different versions and made lots of CD's even tried v4.10 official CD and it still crashes on install
2007-01-08T10:07:00.000Z	Vigo	lexx	I have too pooch it and scram the data? or will any backups I made load in after the scram?
2007-01-08T10:12:00.000Z	Vigo	lexx	It work, ermm worked on the HP I am useing, HP is sorta Comaq,,,
2007-01-08T10:13:00.000Z	lexx	Vigo	Its odd as I have tried different CD's and used them in different CD drives and all installations just crash
2007-01-08T10:17:00.000Z	Vigo	lexx	That is what I did once, the Alternate Install and the i386 both worked in testing but the one did not function after certain repos were added. I am still working on that,,,,,
2007-01-08T10:18:00.000Z	lexx	Vigo	& pike_: It all crashes when saying its mounting the root file system. Also I think there may have been an error message before that saying something about resources. it moved too quickly.
2007-01-08T10:20:00.000Z	Vigo	lexx	Have you set the BIOS to accept it yet?
2007-01-08T10:21:00.000Z	lexx	Vigo	How do you mean, it is setup to boot from CD
2007-01-08T10:23:00.000Z	Vigo	lexx	On mine I had to go into BIOS to set up a dual boot, set Ubuntu as HD1 and Win as HD0 (default) then switched em around for testing. All are different , but that is just how I had to set mine. once
2007-01-08T10:24:00.000Z	lexx	Vigo	Oh, right when this CD is downloaded and burnt I will check in the BIOS, but I am sure I have never seen, that in there.
2007-01-08T10:25:00.000Z	lexx	Vigo	I dont think it even gets as far as the installer, it crashes before it loads that
2007-01-08T10:26:00.000Z	Vigo	lexx	Sure sounds like a boot volume issue if it scrams that fast. Do you ever see the Splash Screen or does it snag in  initial boot mode?
2007-01-08T10:27:00.000Z	lexx	Vigo	Yeah I see the splash screen and it says [OK]  to the first thing and then never does for the "mounting root file system" one
2007-01-08T10:28:00.000Z	lexx	Vigo	when I tried the i386 one, the splash screen appears and the progress bar thing keeps going back and forth but nothing happens other than that.
2007-01-08T10:33:00.000Z	lexx	Vigo	Now burning the alternate amd64 6.
2007-01-08T10:33:00.000Z	lexx	Vigo	Now burning the alternate amd64 6.06 iso
2007-01-08T10:37:00.000Z	lexx	Vigo	Good luck
