2008-12-30T22:47:00.000Z	Gnea		depends who your provider is and who's doing the work
2008-12-30T22:47:00.000Z	NintendoGuy0	Gnea	ever heard of AirWire?
2008-12-30T22:35:00.000Z	Gnea	NintendoGuy0	you're confusing cedega with the main wine tree
2008-12-30T22:41:00.000Z	Gnea	NintendoGuy0	if it was an emulator, XP and Vista would be completely obsolete
2008-12-30T22:42:00.000Z	NintendoGuy0	Gnea	sorry, what do you mean if it was an emulator, XP & Vista would be obselete?
2008-12-30T22:47:00.000Z	Gnea	NintendoGuy0	it's getting better in rural areas
2008-12-30T22:48:00.000Z	Gnea	NintendoGuy0	nope, they a baby-bell?
2008-12-30T22:48:00.000Z	Gnea	NintendoGuy0	allow me to rephrase - cable or dsl? :)
2008-12-30T22:49:00.000Z	Gnea	NintendoGuy0	and a 'baby-bell' is a small telephone company that nobody's heard of
2008-12-30T22:50:00.000Z	Gnea	NintendoGuy0	most baby bells are using a wireless signal these days for rural access - since they're not part of a larger corporation, they can set and demand any price they want and get away with it
2008-12-30T22:50:00.000Z	NintendoGuy0	Gnea	problem is nobody's going to pay for it
2008-12-30T22:51:00.000Z	Gnea	NintendoGuy0	and yet, you and I are having this conversation. :)
2008-12-30T23:08:00.000Z	Gnea	NintendoGuy0	internal?
2008-12-30T23:21:00.000Z	Gnea	NintendoGuy0	is it a winmodem or something else?
2008-12-30T23:23:00.000Z	NintendoGuy0	Gnea	What do you mean?
2008-12-30T23:23:00.000Z	NintendoGuy0	Gnea	I'll message you
2008-12-30T23:23:00.000Z	Gnea	NintendoGuy0	no no, keep it in the channel please
2008-12-30T23:24:00.000Z	Gnea	NintendoGuy0	what exactly are you trying to do? just get the modem to work in ubuntu?
2008-12-30T23:24:00.000Z	NintendoGuy0	Gnea	yes. I'm not sure if it's the modems fault but it does seem that it could be the problem
