2007-11-15T04:40:00.000Z	krisbo9000		dudes, heres whats happening. I want to install grub to the same partition as ubunto, not over the mbr, then install it on a floppy. Heres my set up: dev/sda:
2007-11-15T04:40:00.000Z	krisbo9000		dev/sda1 - ntfs (windows)
2007-11-15T04:40:00.000Z	krisbo9000		dev/sda5 - swap
2007-11-15T04:40:00.000Z	krisbo9000		dev/sda6 - ext3
2007-11-15T04:40:00.000Z	krisbo9000		dev/sdc:
2007-11-15T04:40:00.000Z	krisbo9000		dev/sdc1 - is my flashdisk
2007-11-15T04:40:00.000Z	krisbo9000		sorry
2007-11-15T04:40:00.000Z	clergyman	krisbo9000	Just do grub-install /dev/fd0
2007-11-15T04:41:00.000Z	clergyman	krisbo9000	So back your
2007-11-15T04:42:00.000Z	clergyman	krisbo9000	You're in spoon feeding mode now. Try it, google and read. If you still haven't figured it out. Give up. If you've got a clue and are stuck at a detail, then come ask me
2007-11-15T04:43:00.000Z	clergyman	krisbo9000	Obviously not
2007-11-15T04:43:00.000Z	clergyman	krisbo9000	That 's complete utter rubbish, and you are lazy
2007-11-15T04:43:00.000Z	clergyman	krisbo9000	Is that your conclusion after reading "everything" about grub ?
2007-11-15T04:47:00.000Z	clergyman	krisbo9000	If grub starts at zero, and the /dev structure doesn't, and hda is the first disk and hda5 is the fifth partition, have a guess :)
2007-11-15T04:48:00.000Z	clergyman	krisbo9000	.....
2007-11-15T04:50:00.000Z	clergyman	krisbo9000	*first* hit: http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=grub+partitions+disks+sda4&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
2007-11-15T04:51:00.000Z	clergyman	krisbo9000	Wrong ones obviously... Note root (hd0,5) .. next line.. root=/dev/hda6
2007-11-15T04:53:00.000Z	clergyman	krisbo9000	http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=sda+hda+difference&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8   First hit, will tell you
2007-11-15T04:56:00.000Z	clergyman	krisbo9000	So if you don't have any /dev/hda* devices at all.. and grub suggests (hd0), what's your guess?
