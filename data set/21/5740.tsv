2007-08-19T05:01:00.000Z	dooglus_		Downsay[Linux] : I'll take a look
2007-08-19T05:03:00.000Z	dooglus_		Downsay[Linux] : leave the ports alone - just use ssl for both
2007-08-19T05:03:00.000Z	dooglus_		Downsay[Linux] : secure socket layer
2007-08-19T05:04:00.000Z	dooglus_		Downsay[Linux] : in the settings, you have to specify the authentifcation type.  gmail requires encryption for both pop and smtp
2007-08-19T05:04:00.000Z	Downsay	dooglus_	for secure connection that is?
2007-08-19T05:05:00.000Z	dooglus_	Downsay	don't you see a downdown menu for connection type?
2007-08-19T05:06:00.000Z	Downsay	dooglus_	I got that part figured out now...but now it says my gmail account isn't set to allow for a POP server
2007-08-19T05:06:00.000Z	dooglus_	Downsay	use the webmail interface, go to settings then pop and forwarding and enable pop
2007-08-19T05:07:00.000Z	Downsay	dooglus_	got it, now to test it one last time
2007-08-19T05:07:00.000Z	Downsay	dooglus_	working wonderfully now for receiving my mail
2007-08-19T05:07:00.000Z	dooglus_	Downsay	cool.  sending is much the same, too
2007-08-19T05:08:00.000Z	Downsay	dooglus_	can I use thunderbird as my browser as well?  I had read somewhere that could be done?  and thanks for all the help so far!
2007-08-19T05:08:00.000Z	dooglus_	Downsay	I'd be surprised if you could.  thunderbird is a mail&news client
2007-08-19T05:10:00.000Z	Downsay	dooglus_	http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/thunderbird/nightly/latest-trunk/
2007-08-19T05:10:00.000Z	Downsay	dooglus_	that is the new thunderbird 3.0 download available...how do I install that?
2007-08-19T05:10:00.000Z	dooglus_	Downsay	I don't know, sorry. I never got on with Thunderbird - it's too buggy and not really maintained much.
2007-08-19T05:11:00.000Z	dooglus_	Downsay	I clicked 'reply' once to reply to an email and thunderbird locked up for 2.5 weeks generating the reply window.
2007-08-19T05:11:00.000Z	dooglus_	Downsay	turns out it was busily quoting every line of a huge attachment in the reply!
2007-08-19T05:13:00.000Z	Downsay	dooglus_	I've heard thunderbird is basically the best out there?
