2009-06-09T17:57:00.000Z	bazhang	Ojii	open scim setup
2009-06-09T17:57:00.000Z	bazhang	Ojii	should be a small kb in your upper panel
2009-06-09T17:58:00.000Z	Ojii	bazhang	i know where my scim setup is :D what should i do there?
2009-06-09T17:58:00.000Z	bazhang	Ojii	for irc? or what input mode ie Firefox or other
2009-06-09T18:00:00.000Z	bazhang	Ojii	make sure you have all the language support packs installed
2009-06-09T18:01:00.000Z	bazhang	Ojii	you will need to restart scim for it to work
2009-06-09T18:01:00.000Z	Ojii	bazhang	i did installed them through system->admin->language support and searched for 'useful' stuff in synaptic
2009-06-09T18:01:00.000Z	Ojii	bazhang	restarting it is just exiting it and start it with 'sudo scim -d' right?
2009-06-09T18:01:00.000Z	bazhang	Ojii	did you try right clicking in the irc text entry field
2009-06-09T18:02:00.000Z	Ojii	bazhang	because i did that dozend of times (just did it again) and doesn't work
2009-06-09T18:02:00.000Z	Ojii	bazhang	nope why would i rightclick?
2009-06-09T18:02:00.000Z	bazhang	Ojii	to choose the input method, ie kanji hiragana katakana etc
2009-06-09T18:02:00.000Z	Ojii	bazhang	you're my hero, but how can i do it so i don't have to rightclick first?
2009-06-09T18:03:00.000Z	Ojii	bazhang	and now i have two 'scim' symbols in top right corner
2009-06-09T18:04:00.000Z	bazhang	Ojii	scim/skim is a bit buggy at times; for FF I use quick-locale-switcher plugin along with scim/skim
2009-06-09T18:05:00.000Z	Ojii	bazhang	is there a global setting to make all input boxes use scim instead of 'system (simple)'?
2009-06-09T18:05:00.000Z	bazhang	Ojii	let me check my scim setup
2009-06-09T18:07:00.000Z	bazhang	Ojii	in skim global setup there is 'share this setup with all applications ' box <--be sure to check that
2009-06-09T18:07:00.000Z	Ojii	bazhang	ah i thought that keeps the current input method i chose for all apps
2009-06-09T18:08:00.000Z	Ojii	bazhang	thanks a lot! I owe you a beer if you ever come to tokyo :D
2009-06-09T18:08:00.000Z	bazhang	Ojii	you're welcome :)
