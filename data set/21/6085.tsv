2007-06-06T11:21:00.000Z	anethema		is there a way to totally disable the trash? i never ever want anything to go to the trash when i delete. i dont want to have to shift-delete everythign
2007-06-06T11:22:00.000Z	anethema		anyone?
2007-06-06T11:23:00.000Z	anethema		haha hwilde  you think that would work ?
2007-06-06T11:23:00.000Z	anethema		would it still treat it as a folder though ?
2007-06-06T11:25:00.000Z	anethema		i want to be able to just disable the trash functionality completely
2007-06-06T11:26:00.000Z	anethema		linking to /dev/null didnt work :(
2007-06-06T11:27:00.000Z	anethema		heh yeah
2007-06-06T11:27:00.000Z	anethema		i linked it (symbolic) to /dev/null
2007-06-06T11:27:00.000Z	anethema		but then nautilus just gives an error when trying to delete
2007-06-06T11:28:00.000Z	anethema		i cant believe there is no actual way to disable the trash. even windows lets you disable the recycle bin
2007-06-06T11:29:00.000Z	new-ubuntu-user	anethema	Just don't use "Trash".  What's wrong with that?
2007-06-06T11:29:00.000Z	anethema	new-ubuntu-user	when you press delete, it goes in the trash, there doesnt seem to be a way around it
2007-06-06T11:30:00.000Z	new-ubuntu-user	anethema	But there is a way around it.  rm
2007-06-06T11:30:00.000Z	new-ubuntu-user	anethema	It's quicker to use CLI anyway.
2007-06-06T11:31:00.000Z	anethema	new-ubuntu-user	its not always quicker to use the cli
2007-06-06T11:32:00.000Z	new-ubuntu-user	anethema	but if you have 20 or 30 .txt files, and you click and click and click, when you can just go "rm *.txt"  That's not quicker?
2007-06-06T11:33:00.000Z	new-ubuntu-user	anethema	Yes, those kinds of things are easier done via CLI.
2007-06-06T11:35:00.000Z	new-ubuntu-user	anethema	Well, I just don't see the "Trash" thing being all that inconvienient.  (Using the Ctl key will help you get around it.  Right?)
2007-06-06T11:39:00.000Z	new-ubuntu-user	anethema	Didn't you see teamwork's comment>?
