2005-07-16T06:38:00.000Z	mr_salt	ethics	It crashes when i play a DVD
2005-07-16T06:36:00.000Z	ethics	mr_salt	possibly try a different engine...xine or mplayer maybee for 2 different
2005-07-16T06:36:00.000Z	mr_salt	ethics	mplayer just crashes all the time for me
2005-07-16T06:37:00.000Z	ethics	mr_salt	you will find it's probably not sure what options to use....mplayer lines can be rather long
2005-07-16T06:38:00.000Z	mr_salt	ethics	OK I will give it another go - do you find the version of mplayer that comes with Hoary worked out of the box?
2005-07-16T06:39:00.000Z	ethics	mr_salt	im debian atm migrating one desktop to hoary atm...trying a scary crossgrade hehe
2005-07-16T06:40:00.000Z	ethics	mr_salt	your using xine atm?
2005-07-16T06:40:00.000Z	mr_salt	ethics	yeah
2005-07-16T06:41:00.000Z	ethics	mr_salt	perhaps ogle?  i think thats another dvd one
2005-07-16T06:41:00.000Z	ethics	mr_salt	vlc maybee...just to find out whats going on ie isolated to one or maybe a lib issue etc
2005-07-16T06:43:00.000Z	ethics	mr_salt	i use it but for instance some thing jump in on but not the other depending on codec etc....
2005-07-16T06:43:00.000Z	ethics	mr_salt	xine mostly works great
2005-07-16T06:44:00.000Z	ethics	mr_salt	i think mplayer is a bit more robust on crappy encodes but then it may jusst filter less hehe
2005-07-16T06:56:00.000Z	ethics	mr_salt	yeah some are divx/xvids or soething now
2005-07-16T06:57:00.000Z	mr_salt	ethics	this is an OLD VCD though - dunno why it wont play
2005-07-16T06:57:00.000Z	ethics	mr_salt	some are stil mpg tho ...depends on how trickd oout the pirate was
2005-07-16T06:58:00.000Z	ethics	mr_salt	well the old early ninetys porn were mpeg 1 and indeo i think.
2005-07-16T07:11:00.000Z	ethics	mr_salt	there are gain settings etc you could set...see advances sound on linx or somehing in goole..i fond a page once..
