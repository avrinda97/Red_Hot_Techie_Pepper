2005-06-22T06:27:00.000Z	misaka		It's been a long while since I had my screensaver lock-up on me, I think it was the beta NVidia drivers days.
2005-06-22T06:28:00.000Z	misaka		I just use cpu freq scaling to lower the CPU burn.
2005-06-22T06:29:00.000Z	misaka		heh.
2005-06-22T06:30:00.000Z	misaka		Eesh, I've got all you guys beat with my OSX machine.

2005-06-22T06:30:00.000Z	misaka		mahahaha
2005-06-22T06:31:00.000Z	misaka		Ya, well, this _is_ OSX ...
2005-06-22T06:31:00.000Z	misaka		OSX isn't the most efficient OS, unfortunately.
2005-06-22T06:31:00.000Z	misaka		But then, I do have a shit-load of apps running.
2005-06-22T06:33:00.000Z	misaka		Not all OSs have as many kernel updates as Linux, for example.
2005-06-22T06:33:00.000Z	bob2	misaka	most just don't acknowledge them, afaict
2005-06-22T06:34:00.000Z	misaka	bob2	- Well, ya, there's also that.

2005-06-22T09:17:00.000Z	bob2	misaka	yes
2005-06-22T09:17:00.000Z	misaka	bob2	- What's the point, versus a kick?
2005-06-22T09:17:00.000Z	bob2	misaka	it's silly, but it tends to not trigger people's auto-rejoin scripts
2005-06-22T09:17:00.000Z	bob2	misaka	^^
2005-06-22T09:19:00.000Z	bob2	misaka	hah, I'm in screen, but I always forget the cut'n'paste keys
2005-06-22T09:20:00.000Z	misaka	bob2	- ^A-ESC, vi keys to navigate, space to mark, then space again to copy and exit. ^A-]  to paste. ;]
