2011-05-05T12:05:00.000Z	ondrejk		hello, after upgrading to new version my nm-applet and volume control applet disappeared, tray is not missing and nm-applet --sm-disabled exists in autostart applications, when i run nm-applet manually into console, nm-applet icon will show up

2011-05-05T12:05:00.000Z	ondrejk	Blue1	yup

2011-05-05T12:08:00.000Z	ondrejk	Blue1	it does not work for network manager applet
2011-05-05T12:09:00.000Z	Blue1	ondrejk	oops I though you said volume control
2011-05-05T12:10:00.000Z	ondrejk	Blue1	volume control does not work also, but this is not as problematic as missing network manager plugin
2011-05-05T12:10:00.000Z	Blue1	ondrejk	let me schlep for a sec
2011-05-05T12:11:00.000Z	ondrejk	Blue1	i dont understand it, command which should start nm-applet is already present in autostart applications but it wont start after login, each time i log gin i need to type nm-applet into terminal
2011-05-05T12:11:00.000Z	ondrejk	Blue1	ok
2011-05-05T12:11:00.000Z	Blue1	ondrejk	you do have a notification area, right?

2011-05-05T12:14:00.000Z	Blue1	ondrejk	best I could find -- not tried it personally
2011-05-05T12:14:00.000Z	ondrejk	Blue1	this is not my problem, i can start nm-applet manually .. but it wont start automatically after logging in
2011-05-05T12:15:00.000Z	Blue1	ondrejk	and this tells you how to fix that.
2011-05-05T12:17:00.000Z	Blue1	ondrejk	iow System/Preferences/Startup Applications/Options/ click on automatically remember running apps when logging out -- then click remember currently running apps
