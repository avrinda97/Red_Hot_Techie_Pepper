2006-06-29T12:04:00.000Z	WhoDaBear		Hi there folks.  Yet another newbie.  Anyone feeling helpful?  I've got a problem reading from one CD drive, and the writer will read fine but not write!  I've attempted to sort out my fstab, but still no better.  Have fstab up and disk manager up if that helps.  Cheers.  WhoDaBear (UK)
2006-06-29T12:06:00.000Z	green_earz	WhoDaBear	paste your fstab file into  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2006-06-29T12:07:00.000Z	green_earz	WhoDaBear	and paste the link back here
2006-06-29T12:09:00.000Z	WhoDaBear	green_earz	- good job you said that!  Here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16774
2006-06-29T12:12:00.000Z	green_earz	WhoDaBear	by the look of thing you have two cd drivers ?  put a cd into one of drives and from a termal use the comman " mount/media/cdrom0 "  or " mount/media/cdrom1  "
2006-06-29T12:13:00.000Z	green_earz	WhoDaBear	sorry its " mount /media/cdrom0 "  or " mount /media/cdrom1  "
2006-06-29T12:14:00.000Z	WhoDaBear	green_earz	 Thanks again.  Two drives.  One reader one writer.  Both internal.  Writer will read disks fine, but not write.  Reader will show me directory contents etc. but not let me copy to desktop.  Says I don't have permission.  Will try mounting now.  WDB.
2006-06-29T12:16:00.000Z	WhoDaBear	green_earz	 Seems to mount fine auto when I stick the discs in.  Discs there on desktop.  Still want me to try mounting at the terminal?  Sorry - real Newbie!  Cheers.  WDB
2006-06-29T12:17:00.000Z	green_earz	WhoDaBear	no thats ok but what the app you are using for burning ?
2006-06-29T12:18:00.000Z	WhoDaBear	green_earz	- Just trying to drag files there.  That not good plan?  Assumed not working as other drive *definitely* not right!
2006-06-29T12:19:00.000Z	green_earz	WhoDaBear	so what the program that you are using for burn a cd or dvd ?
2006-06-29T12:21:00.000Z	WhoDaBear	green_earz	- sorry - give me a sec.
2006-06-29T12:37:00.000Z	green_earz	WhoDaBear	what do the command groups   out put and paste back here
2006-06-29T12:38:00.000Z	WhoDaBear	green_earz	- sorry - didn't understand that!
2006-06-29T12:40:00.000Z	green_earz	WhoDaBear	from a terminal use the command : groups    to see if you are in the cdrom group. i think you are all ready in that group, just checking
2006-06-29T12:41:00.000Z	WhoDaBear	green_earz	- creatures adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin  Thanks.  WDB
2006-06-29T12:43:00.000Z	green_earz	WhoDaBear	 from the command line configure cdrecord so user can use it, no just root use.  comman " sudo dpkg-reconfigure cdrecord  "  and answer yes to the question it gives
2006-06-29T12:47:00.000Z	WhoDaBear	green_earz	(previous mis-spell).  Am trying to burn again now.  wdb.
2006-06-29T12:48:00.000Z	green_earz	WhoDaBear	can you see the problem from the paste >   Error: Cannot gain SYS_RAWIO capability.Is cdrecord installed SUID root? Operation not permitted   > thats why sudo dpkg-reconfigure cdrecord
2006-06-29T12:55:00.000Z	WhoDaBear	green_earz	- thanks for help so far.  Gonna give up and re-heat last night's curry.  Try again tomorrow I guess.  Thanks.  wdb.
