2010-04-03T15:24:00.000Z	redilyn_		i need help with a software raid problem, can someone help me?
2010-04-03T15:24:00.000Z	iceroot	redilyn_	the manpage or a detailed question
2010-04-03T15:28:00.000Z	iceroot	redilyn_	hm raid0, with raid 1 i would say remove the borken part of the array (mdadm -r /dev/sdX) and reappend it (mdadm -a /dev/sdX) so the array could be rebuild but with raid0 i dont think that is working
2010-04-03T15:28:00.000Z	iceroot	redilyn_	not i a running system
2010-04-03T15:29:00.000Z	redilyn_	iceroot	the 2 partitions which makeup md1 are still there and appear fine, but when i try to assemble them it says bad superblock on /dev/sda2
2010-04-03T15:53:00.000Z	redilyn_	iceroot	why does it tell me device or resourse busy? "udo mdadm -A /dev/sda7 /dev/sdb2 /dev/md1
2010-04-03T15:54:00.000Z	iceroot	redilyn_	imo sudo mdadm -a /dev/sda7 /dev/md1 && sudo mdadm -a /dev/sdb2 /dev/md1
2010-04-03T15:55:00.000Z	redilyn_	iceroot	mdadm: cannot get array info for /dev/sda7
2010-04-03T15:55:00.000Z	redilyn_	iceroot	changed the error message....
2010-04-03T15:56:00.000Z	iceroot	redilyn_	i cqant remeber what was the correct way
2010-04-03T15:56:00.000Z	iceroot	redilyn_	maybe search for a tutorial on building raid0 with mdadm
2010-04-03T15:57:00.000Z	redilyn_	iceroot	this might change things, fdisk lists md1 as assembled?!? Disk /dev/md1: 151.0 GB, 151024107520 bytes
2010-04-03T15:58:00.000Z	iceroot	redilyn_	cat /proc/mdadm (use tab to complete, dont have mdadm running here, there you will see the status of the raid)
2010-04-03T15:59:00.000Z	redilyn_	iceroot	md1 : active raid0 sda7[0] sdb2[1] 147484480 blocks 64k chunks - so perhaps i just need to recover the ext4 partition stored on md1?
2010-04-03T15:59:00.000Z	iceroot	redilyn_	your md1 is /?
2010-04-03T16:00:00.000Z	redilyn_	iceroot	no md1 is /home, this is why im trying so hard to get it back
2010-04-03T16:00:00.000Z	redilyn_	iceroot	md0 was /, i told the installer to format it
2010-04-03T16:01:00.000Z	redilyn_	iceroot	it failed to format md0 which is what caused all of this
2010-04-03T16:01:00.000Z	iceroot	redilyn_	but the result from /proc/mdadm is looking good
2010-04-03T16:02:00.000Z	redilyn_	iceroot	yes but the ext4 partition from md1 is no where to be found, i had no idea the array was already assembled. is it safe to use testdisk on md1 to try and recover the partition?
