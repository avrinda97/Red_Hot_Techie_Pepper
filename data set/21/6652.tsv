2007-02-24T12:47:00.000Z	bula		more ubuntu install questions lol.   i just tried to install it on my pc and it just sits on my computer loading when it gets to the part where it is trying to partition my HD.  my hd light doesnt light up and i dont hear anything.  its as if it doesnt recognise my hard drive.  my HD is 80GB serial ata. does that have anything to do with it?
2007-02-24T12:48:00.000Z	bula		it sat for a good 10 minutes or so
2007-02-24T12:49:00.000Z	bula		im installing the 6.1 for amd64
2007-02-24T12:50:00.000Z	bula		i dont know what mode it runs at.  i just put it on my mobo and installed windows.  now i want ubuntu.
2007-02-24T12:50:00.000Z	bula		and no i didnt try giving different partition parameters
2007-02-24T12:50:00.000Z	bula		i woudlnt even know where to begin to give different parameters and stuff

2007-02-24T12:51:00.000Z	bula	Frogzoo	what i meant was that there was no noise at all.  it sat for like 10 min and did nothing and my hard drive made no noise.  i would have expected it to make some type of noise if it was trying to partition or something
2007-02-24T12:53:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bula	ext3 partition only takes a few seconds
2007-02-24T12:54:00.000Z	bula	Frogzoo	so what do i do to install Ubuntu exactly?   i was on step 5 of 6 and it just sat and sat and sat with a message saying "you can manually partition your hard drive or have ubuntu do it automatically"  and it wouldnt let me go forward and it did nothing for 10 minutes.  it was as if it was frozen but i could do other things still
2007-02-24T12:55:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bula	did you choose automatic install? do you have a partition free for linux to install on?
2007-02-24T12:56:00.000Z	bula	Frogzoo	i just pressed the install button from the desktop on my ubuntu desktop cd thingy
2007-02-24T12:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bula	but at this point of the install, you have to choose whether to do manual or automatic partitioning
2007-02-24T12:58:00.000Z	bula	Frogzoo	i was at that point but it would not let me choose any type of partitioning.  it just sat there.  i couldnt go forward, couldnt select auto, or couldnt select manual.   it was just a little cursor in the shape of a circle with a dot going around in it
2007-02-24T13:00:00.000Z	bula	Frogzoo	so it shouldnt matter that i have a serial ata hard drive when its sitting on that window right?  so i should just let it sit for a bit longer maybe and see if it makes progress?
2007-02-24T13:01:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bula	no, if the install's not obviously doing something, there's something wrong
2007-02-24T13:01:00.000Z	bula	Frogzoo	do you have any idea what it could be?
2007-02-24T13:02:00.000Z	bula	Frogzoo	right now i have windows installed on my hard drive.  maybe its taking up all the room on the partition or something?
2007-02-24T13:03:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bula	some few installs need you to pass the kernel option 'acpi=off' from the grub menu - boot the CD & hit F6 at the menu - edit the kernel line & add that option, might help
2007-02-24T13:04:00.000Z	bula	Frogzoo	that is way above my head.  i lost you after pressing f6 =/      maybe im not advanced enough to use this stuff =(
2007-02-24T13:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bula	mostly it 'just works' - but not on all hardware - google 'acpi=off + grub" should get you some hits
