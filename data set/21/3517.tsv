2009-09-11T22:39:00.000Z	ManDay		My terminal is very slow when scrolling - what might be the reason?
2009-09-11T22:41:00.000Z	ManDay		When I scroll a man page in my terminal, its very laggy - what might cause this?
2009-09-11T22:41:00.000Z	ManDay		jp, i dont know - how could i figure out?
2009-09-11T22:41:00.000Z	ManDay		@ jp210168
2009-09-11T22:42:00.000Z	ManDay		its not THAT bad, jp210168 - but its not smooth either. and i think it should scroll smoothly, even though its just an atom processor and onboard graphics.
2009-09-11T22:43:00.000Z	ManDay		yes jp210168
2009-09-11T22:43:00.000Z	ManDay		wow?
2009-09-11T22:43:00.000Z	sascha_	ManDay	videochip?
2009-09-11T22:44:00.000Z	sascha_	ManDay	definately not normal. try to nail it down: read xorg.log, disable compiz, use differen wm ...
2009-09-11T22:46:00.000Z	sascha_	ManDay	plz describe precisly what is lagging. would moving any large window around lag?
2009-09-11T22:48:00.000Z	sascha_	ManDay	ok but you really should TURN OFF compiz to rule it out
2009-09-11T22:48:00.000Z	sascha_	ManDay	even without effect just the compositor could slow things down
2009-09-11T22:49:00.000Z	ManDay	sascha_	how can i turn of compiz completely?
2009-09-11T22:49:00.000Z	sascha_	ManDay	in the appearance thing
2009-09-11T22:50:00.000Z	ManDay	sascha_	jp210168 i turned off compiz and it sstill lags as much as before (when in fullscreen or maximized)
2009-09-11T23:24:00.000Z	sascha_	ManDay	grep your xorg.log for EE and WW
2009-09-11T23:25:00.000Z	ManDay	sascha_	my xorg.conf is mostly empty
2009-09-11T23:26:00.000Z	ManDay	sascha_	in regards to what?
2009-09-11T23:27:00.000Z	ManDay	sascha_	i mean in regards to what problem i have?
2009-09-11T23:32:00.000Z	sascha_	ManDay	did you do it?
