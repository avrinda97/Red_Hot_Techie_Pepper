2007-07-29T07:56:00.000Z	Icehawk		ill stick around waiting for flightsim to finish downloading :)
2007-07-29T07:56:00.000Z	Icehawk		i only use windoze for playing games that i cant play in ubuntu
2007-07-29T07:57:00.000Z	Icehawk		the only thing ubuntu misses is NTFS write support
2007-07-29T07:58:00.000Z	Icehawk		experimental or complete?
2007-07-29T07:58:00.000Z	dystopianray	Icehawk	complete
2007-07-29T07:58:00.000Z	dystopianray	Icehawk	it's been around for over a year
2007-07-29T08:10:00.000Z	dystopianray	Icehawk	that is normal
2007-07-29T08:10:00.000Z	dystopianray	Icehawk	ath0 and wifi0 are the atheros card
2007-07-29T08:12:00.000Z	dystopianray	Icehawk	one of them is a virtual interface
2007-07-29T08:13:00.000Z	dystopianray	Icehawk	i'd imagine ath0 should show the true rate
2007-07-29T08:13:00.000Z	dystopianray	Icehawk	you can create multiple virtual interfaces to (from what I understand) connect to multiple aps, run multiple aps and do other multiple things
2007-07-29T08:13:00.000Z	Icehawk	dystopianray	hmm, didnt knew about that
2007-07-29T08:14:00.000Z	Icehawk	dystopianray	i suppose wifi0 is showing ath0 rate + overhead

2007-07-29T08:14:00.000Z	Icehawk	dystopianray	will read
2007-07-29T08:16:00.000Z	Icehawk	dystopianray	wait, you basicly can set any number of connections using just 1 interface??
2007-07-29T08:16:00.000Z	dystopianray	Icehawk	you create multiple virtual interfaces
2007-07-29T08:16:00.000Z	Icehawk	dystopianray	which could be used for different types of connection
2007-07-29T08:17:00.000Z	dystopianray	Icehawk	yes, from what I understand
2007-07-29T08:17:00.000Z	Icehawk	dystopianray	like an AP and P2P network
2007-07-29T08:18:00.000Z	dystopianray	Icehawk	yes, i imagine so
