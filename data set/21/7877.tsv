2009-05-12T18:46:00.000Z	donkeyboy		I am running jaunty and need to run windows xp for some software, I have tried virtualbox, but the performance is pretty bad, is their anything better? or is my machine just not beefy enough?
2009-05-12T18:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	donkeyboy	 youdid install the virtualbox guest addations  inside  the virtual XP? it helps a lot.
2009-05-12T18:48:00.000Z	donkeyboy	Dr_Willis	yes, I have guest tools installed
2009-05-12T18:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	donkeyboy	 virtualbox, vmware, or wine.. are the main options.
2009-05-12T18:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	donkeyboy	 i doubt if vmware will give that much better performacene.
2009-05-12T18:49:00.000Z	donkeyboy	Dr_Willis	yes, WINE is out for me. Ok great that is what I needed to know, so will just stick with VB and try slim down my XP install, many thanks
2010-10-24T12:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	donkeyboy	 i would suggest getting an Nvidia based laptop if looking at a new one.
2010-10-24T12:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	donkeyboy	 nvidia has MUCH better support in linux. if its priomary to be a linux box.. i suggest nvidia
2010-10-24T12:42:00.000Z	donkeyboy	Dr_Willis	ouyes: ok, so nvidia is still the better option
2010-10-24T12:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	donkeyboy	 and check the guides at -> http://www.notebookcheck.net
2010-10-24T12:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	donkeyboy	 i basically will NEVER (any time soon) buy ati based anything for my linuix needs.
2010-10-24T12:43:00.000Z	donkeyboy	Dr_Willis	Thanks. Ok, yeah it's going to be a pure ubuntu box
2010-10-24T12:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	donkeyboy	 theni would definatly avoide ati.
2010-10-24T12:43:00.000Z	donkeyboy	Dr_Willis	Thanks
2010-10-24T12:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	donkeyboy	 look for a 'class 2' video card at least. in a new machine.
2010-10-24T12:46:00.000Z	donkeyboy	Dr_Willis	Ok thanks. Will go try and find a machine with nvidia.
2010-10-24T12:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	donkeyboy	 i printed out the video card list and CPU lists on that site. then took them shopping. Found me a lapotp with the highest video card/cpu i could manage for my budget. :)
2010-10-24T12:47:00.000Z	donkeyboy	Dr_Willis	Great Idea
2010-10-24T12:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	donkeyboy	 I ended up with a Nvidia 360M video card. (the highest the store had on the list) It blows my desktop box away in 3d. :)
2010-10-24T12:48:00.000Z	donkeyboy	Dr_Willis	thanks
2010-10-24T12:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	donkeyboy	 its all about your budget in the end.  and best bang for the buck.
