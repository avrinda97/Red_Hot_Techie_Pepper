2012-10-27T08:34:00.000Z	steven-	dbv	just a second faster : )
2012-10-27T08:34:00.000Z	dbv	steven-	upgraded my DSL just last month? :)
2012-10-27T08:35:00.000Z	steven-	dbv	i can tell, your bytes are just faster
2012-10-27T08:40:00.000Z	dbv	steven-	went from 5 meg to 10 meg DSL, oooh, the speed...
2012-10-27T08:40:00.000Z	steven-	dbv	i guess you are closer to the irc then, cos i have 20
2012-10-27T08:41:00.000Z	steven-	dbv	i have to be at least twice as far away from the IRC since your bytes arrive faster
2012-10-27T08:42:00.000Z	steven-	dbv	seriously, thank you XD
2012-10-27T08:43:00.000Z	dbv	steven-	i doubt that i'm closer :)
2012-10-27T08:44:00.000Z	dbv	steven-	np ;)
2012-10-27T08:44:00.000Z	steven-	dbv	can't see it, the only ones i have are announce away messages, show away once, and automaticall unmark away

2012-10-27T08:53:00.000Z	steven-	dbv	you can change it in linux as well
2012-10-27T08:57:00.000Z	dbv	steven-	it's the same thing, if you can put it in as one of the startup commands
2012-10-27T08:57:00.000Z	dbv	steven-	x-chat aqua doesn't seem to be updated any more anyway...
2012-10-27T08:58:00.000Z	dbv	steven-	and colloquy sucks
2012-10-27T08:58:00.000Z	dbv	steven-	it's built from same sources but maybe not by the same guys
2012-10-27T08:59:00.000Z	dbv	steven-	you didn't mind it?
2012-10-27T08:59:00.000Z	steven-	dbv	no, actually not, on mac i was using colloquy instead of xchat
2012-10-27T09:01:00.000Z	dbv	steven-	i can't get the log to print anything useful, it's annoying. but then again i only tried it for about 60 secs and went back to x-chat
