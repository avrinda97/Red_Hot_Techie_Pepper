2008-04-24T16:27:00.000Z	thefish	Myrtti	is there an official torrent to post the link to - might stop some of the braying
2008-04-24T16:28:00.000Z	Myrtti	thefish	there is no such thing as official until the mail is sent to ubuntu-announce mailing list
2008-04-24T16:29:00.000Z	Myrtti	thefish	indeed
2008-04-24T16:29:00.000Z	Myrtti	thefish	It's almost three o'clock and I've barely eaten my breakfast since I have to babysit you fellers
2008-04-24T17:12:00.000Z	Myrtti	thefish	no
2008-04-24T17:13:00.000Z	thefish	Myrtti	is there a way to tell what the animal is called? my /etc/issue is just the number release
2008-04-24T17:13:00.000Z	Myrtti	thefish	lsb_release -a
2008-04-24T17:14:00.000Z	thefish	Myrtti	thanks
2010-02-01T14:21:00.000Z	Myrtti	thefish	grub2 is the default
2010-02-01T14:21:00.000Z	thefish	Myrtti	is there a different way to fix things with grub2?
2010-02-01T14:22:00.000Z	Myrtti	thefish	yes. Unfortunately the wiki is down so I can't really give you a good link on our wiki about it
2010-02-01T14:22:00.000Z	Myrtti	thefish	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2 would be the location
2010-02-01T14:22:00.000Z	thefish	Myrtti	ok cool, will keep trying with google, ta
2010-02-01T14:30:00.000Z	thefish	Myrtti	dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc was all that was needed - looks like the installer may have missed that bit
