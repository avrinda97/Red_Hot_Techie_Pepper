2007-06-29T11:07:00.000Z	logreeval		well, when i try to install it, nothing happens at all
2007-06-29T11:07:00.000Z	logreeval		sudo ./vmware-install.pl
2007-06-29T11:07:00.000Z	logreeval		hmm, could i find that repository?
2007-06-29T11:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	logreeval	 you are in the proper directory?
2007-06-29T11:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	logreeval	 you do realize that when you enter a password form the shell. NOTHIGN will get echoed back.
2007-08-29T10:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	logreeval	 what video card? If it takes a power conector. you DID hook it up?
2007-08-29T10:32:00.000Z	logreeval	Dr_willis	the little fan runs...i didnt plug anything into it....
2007-08-29T10:32:00.000Z	logreeval	Dr_willis	it doesnt have a power connector
2007-08-29T10:32:00.000Z	logreeval	Dr_willis	there arent video cards that are just for windows?
2007-08-29T10:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	logreeval	 i cant think of any. Most all video cards can do vga, or vesa modes.
2007-08-29T10:34:00.000Z	logreeval	Dr_willis	ok, do you think this card is a dud?
2007-08-29T10:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	logreeval	 no idea. Could be.
2007-08-29T10:35:00.000Z	logreeval	Dr_willis	i gues syou dont have any ideas on what to do then?
2007-08-29T10:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	logreeval	 remove/reseat the card. clean the edge conectors.. what IS the card anyway? what brand?
2007-08-29T10:36:00.000Z	logreeval	Dr_willis	diamond
2007-08-29T10:36:00.000Z	logreeval	Dr_willis	radeon 9550 or something like that
2007-08-29T10:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	logreeval	 for linux ussage. I would suggest taking it back and getting a Nvidia card.
2007-08-29T10:38:00.000Z	logreeval	Dr_willis	ok
