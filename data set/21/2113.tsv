2011-09-03T06:36:00.000Z	phong_		hi guys
2011-09-03T06:36:00.000Z	phong_		;)
2011-09-03T06:37:00.000Z	phong_		is it a good choice to install ubuntu on SSD or just regular SATA drive?
2011-09-03T06:37:00.000Z	phong_		anyone of you give me good suggestion?
2011-09-03T06:37:00.000Z	phong_		your help is appreciated.
2011-09-03T06:38:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	phong_	what do you "good idea"?
2011-09-03T06:38:00.000Z	phong_	Mean_Admin	currently i install windows ...do you think i should have another SSD for ubuntu>?
2011-09-03T06:39:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	phong_	you can simply dual-boot on the same drive
2011-09-03T06:39:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	phong_	unless it's super small
2011-09-03T06:39:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	phong_	that is, unless you don't have enough space left on it
2011-09-03T06:39:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	phong_	I've lived with 10GB
2011-09-03T06:39:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	phong_	but probably less
2011-09-03T06:40:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	phong_	my case was some time ago, I don't know today but I'm assuming 10GB is enough
2011-09-03T06:40:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	phong_	you can adjust afterwards, yes
2011-09-03T06:41:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	phong_	although _I_ have never really done it myself
2011-09-03T06:41:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	phong_	well, you have to burn the Ubuntu LiveCD
2011-09-03T06:42:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	phong_	then you boot off the CD and Ubuntu will guide you with a wizard and ask you how much space you want to give it
2011-09-03T06:42:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	phong_	it's visual, no command line
2011-09-03T06:43:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	phong_	it won't mess up with Windows; when you boot the computer, you'll be asked whether you want to boot Ubuntu or Windows
2011-09-03T06:44:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	phong_	just burn a livecd of Ubuntu
2011-09-03T06:44:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	phong_	you can even try it without installing it
