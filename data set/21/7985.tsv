2006-06-17T13:58:00.000Z	RamiKassab		I think I may just have to install QuickBooks on my development laptop that's always running at home
2006-06-17T13:59:00.000Z	spikeb	RamiKassab	are you a decent writer and explainer?
2006-06-17T13:59:00.000Z	RamiKassab	spikeb	I guess, why?
2006-06-17T13:59:00.000Z	spikeb	RamiKassab	do you think you could write something to, say, the gnucash team and the kmymoney team about what their apps are missing?
2006-06-17T14:00:00.000Z	RamiKassab	spikeb	I have considered that, I just installed GNUCash yesterday but I can't wait for those changes to be implemented... business calls and accounting is a daily thing for me
2006-06-17T14:01:00.000Z	RamiKassab	spikeb	I run 4 businesses and use QuickBooks for them all
2006-06-17T14:01:00.000Z	spikeb	RamiKassab	yes, i understand that you can not wait, but perhaps writing an email or something would do some good - it lets the developers know what they need to do
2006-06-17T14:03:00.000Z	RamiKassab	spikeb	I will write something for them but I need to play around with the apps a little more, but that doesn't solve my issue right now so when I figure out a way to do what I want, I will spend the time writing an email to them
2006-06-17T14:03:00.000Z	RamiKassab	spikeb	I know it helps the community and that's a good suggestion
2006-06-17T14:03:00.000Z	spikeb	RamiKassab	my advice is to use the machine remotely :)
2006-06-17T14:03:00.000Z	RamiKassab	spikeb	that's what I may do
2006-06-17T14:04:00.000Z	spikeb	RamiKassab	you have a couple more options as well - you can use vmware, and make a new windows install in it, or you can buy crossover office, and use it to install quickbooks (assumming it supports quickbooks)
2006-06-17T14:05:00.000Z	spikeb	RamiKassab	it runs windows binaries
2006-06-17T14:05:00.000Z	RamiKassab	spikeb	hmm, kind of like WINE tries to do?
2006-06-17T14:05:00.000Z	spikeb	RamiKassab	exactly. crossover office is a commercial fork/variant of wine
2006-06-17T14:05:00.000Z	RamiKassab	spikeb	so it must support much more software eh
2006-06-17T14:06:00.000Z	spikeb	RamiKassab	im not sure about MORE, but it specifically targets certain applications (like MS Office, for example) and ensures they work
2006-06-17T14:11:00.000Z	spikeb	RamiKassab	cedega is a gaming focused commercial fork of wine
2006-06-17T14:11:00.000Z	RamiKassab	spikeb	oic
2006-06-17T14:14:00.000Z	RamiKassab	spikeb	I appreciate the help brother
2006-06-17T14:14:00.000Z	spikeb	RamiKassab	no problem :)
