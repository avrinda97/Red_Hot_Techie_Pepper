2010-12-30T20:58:00.000Z	Kevin147		My brothers laptop is a Dell Inspiron 1545, and it seems that the wireless is messed up. He can connect on ethernet, and the internet works. But when he connects with wireless, it connects, but theres no internet...how can I fix this?
2010-12-30T21:00:00.000Z	Kevin147		No, its a broadcom wireless driver. It works on some wireless modems, but ours, it won't work.
2010-12-30T21:00:00.000Z	rs0832	Kevin147	you have a broadcom modem?
2010-12-30T21:01:00.000Z	Kevin147	rs0832	no, my brother has a broadcom driver for his wireless, I do also, but mine works, his doesn't.
2010-12-30T21:01:00.000Z	rs0832	Kevin147	same wireless modem?
2010-12-30T21:01:00.000Z	Kevin147	rs0832	yup
2010-12-30T21:02:00.000Z	rs0832	Kevin147	are you sure that the drivers are installed properly? did it work before?
2010-12-30T21:03:00.000Z	Kevin147	rs0832	when I installed Ubuntu on my laptop, it did it automatically being connected to ethernet, I did the same thing to his, and it shows wireless networks and everything, its just when you connect to the wireless the internet won't work.
2010-12-30T21:03:00.000Z	Kevin147		We went on vacation and just got back yesterday, and he connected to some guys wireless and it worked.
2010-12-30T21:04:00.000Z	rs0832	Kevin147	hmm then i can only think of a configuration problem.. did you install any updates?
2010-12-30T21:05:00.000Z	Kevin147	rs0832	yeah I installed updates on both.
2010-12-30T21:05:00.000Z	Kevin147	rs0832	I think I did anyway. let me check.
2010-12-30T21:05:00.000Z	rs0832	Kevin147	ok.. check if both have the same kernel versions
2010-12-30T21:06:00.000Z	Kevin147	rs0832	Forgot to update his. I'll be back later if it doesn't work.
2010-12-30T21:06:00.000Z	rs0832	Kevin147	wait
2010-12-30T21:06:00.000Z	Kevin147	rs0832	yes?
2010-12-30T21:06:00.000Z	rs0832	Kevin147	so yours works right? or was that his? the wireless, i mean
2010-12-30T21:07:00.000Z	Kevin147		Mine works. I have a Lenovo G550, he has a Dell Inspiron 1545, but same wireless card. His won't work, but mine does.
2010-12-30T21:07:00.000Z	Kevin147	rs0832	^^
