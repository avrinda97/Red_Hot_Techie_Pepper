2006-07-03T13:03:00.000Z	Kennie		hi installed newest ubuntu dapper drake and i get if i do cat /etc/debian_version that its unstable is that true?
2006-07-03T13:03:00.000Z	Kennie		(server version)
2006-07-03T13:04:00.000Z	Kennie		not true? :P, cus need to be a very stable server
2006-07-03T13:04:00.000Z	dli	Kennie	install debian then :)
2006-07-03T13:05:00.000Z	Kennie		yeah but there is no /etc/ubuntu_version ?: P
2006-07-03T13:05:00.000Z	dli	Kennie	one major new feature from dapper is being buggy:)
2006-07-03T13:06:00.000Z	Kennie		it was planned to be a debian machine but the crappy kernel didnt find the sata hdds and i couldnt be arsed to do much work to get it work (neither the 2.6 kernel would find it)
2006-07-03T13:07:00.000Z	dli	Kennie	can you install debian testing?
2006-07-03T13:07:00.000Z	Kennie	dli	what u mean?
2006-07-03T13:08:00.000Z	dli	Kennie	debian etch, instead of sarge
2006-07-03T13:09:00.000Z	Kennie	dli	google says etch giving even MORE trouble with that s-ata driver :p
2006-07-03T13:09:00.000Z	dli	Kennie	what's the kernel version in etch?
2006-07-03T13:10:00.000Z	Kennie	dli	pff dunno didnt test but sarge didnt work @ linux26 boot parameter
2006-07-03T13:10:00.000Z	Kennie		but more important is ubuntu 6.06 stable enough to run 1 month or so crash free?
2006-07-03T13:11:00.000Z	dli	Kennie	etch supports sata
2006-07-03T13:11:00.000Z	dli	Kennie	I saw too many dev bugs being asked here again and again, after dapper released
2006-07-03T13:12:00.000Z	dli	Kennie	I suggest you to search hardware howto for your sata chipset
2006-07-03T13:13:00.000Z	Kennie	dli	only solution was to install sarge on a IDE, recompile kernel and so and then move it to the s-ata disk
2006-07-03T13:13:00.000Z	dli	Kennie	if you have an ide disk at hand
2006-07-03T13:14:00.000Z	Kennie	dli	sure have one but what if the damn thing needs to be reinstalled, would give MUCH downtime since i need to recompile kernel and whole stuff and copy from hd -> hd
2006-07-03T13:15:00.000Z	dli	Kennie	a basic debian installation is 300MB, so, 1 minute of cp time
