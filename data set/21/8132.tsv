2007-06-11T13:47:00.000Z	UzzaDead		compiz-manager i think?
2007-06-11T13:48:00.000Z	UzzaDead		doh
2007-06-11T13:48:00.000Z	UzzaDead		i ran beryl but the stability caused me to uninstall it
2007-06-11T13:49:00.000Z	UzzaDead		:)
2007-06-11T13:50:00.000Z	UzzaDead		is there a way i can make linux stop trying to kill me?
2007-06-11T13:50:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	UzzaDead	stop giving your computer firearms.
2007-06-11T13:51:00.000Z	UzzaDead	kitsuneofdoom	i tried it then violently ejected the cd-rom tray causing the disc to fly out just grazing my forehead!
2007-06-11T13:51:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	UzzaDead	is this a dual boot machine?
2007-06-11T13:51:00.000Z	UzzaDead	kitsuneofdoom	it is
2007-06-11T13:51:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	UzzaDead	and it works under windows?
2007-06-11T13:52:00.000Z	UzzaDead		no :)
2007-06-11T13:52:00.000Z	UzzaDead		i think its windows influencing linux to try to kill me for not using windows
2007-06-11T13:52:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	UzzaDead	if you have the same problem in windows, I suggest you open up your computer, remove the little power cable, and look into a new cd drive.
2007-06-11T13:53:00.000Z	UzzaDead	kitsuneofdoom	i was totally joking but thanks for the suggestion :)
2007-06-11T13:53:00.000Z	UzzaDead		im just having power/shutdown issues at random using linux
2007-06-11T13:53:00.000Z	UzzaDead		!fsck
2007-06-11T13:53:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom		!dpkg-reconfigure
2007-06-11T13:53:00.000Z	UzzaDead		is it wise to run fsck on a running filesystem?
2007-06-11T13:54:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	UzzaDead	no.
