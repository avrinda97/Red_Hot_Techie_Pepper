2010-10-11T04:54:00.000Z	mamece2		if i can install BT4 in dual boot mode using 10 Gb, why should i use a VM that will consume the same 10 Gb? whats the difference?
2010-10-11T04:54:00.000Z	jrib	mamece2	what is bt4?
2011-12-04T19:02:00.000Z	jrib	mamece2	use your favorite text editor?
2011-12-04T19:02:00.000Z	mamece2	jrib	i mean only in CLI, nothing with GUI, im stuck in console
2011-12-04T19:03:00.000Z	jrib	mamece2	yes, there are text editors that do not use a gui.  Like nano or vim.  But I would suggest instead just stating your real issue (why do you want to create an xorg.conf?) to the channel
2011-12-04T19:05:00.000Z	mamece2	jrib	i have the trident problem. the screen is messed. so i have read in forums that i need to create the xorg.conf file. leafpad command display "cant open the visor"
2011-12-04T19:08:00.000Z	jrib	mamece2	Xorg -configure will generate some sort of minimal xorg.conf
2011-12-04T19:26:00.000Z	mamece2	jrib	i have this problem, when i do "sudo Xorg -configure" i get "fatal server error: could not create lock file in /temp/.tX0-lock
2011-12-04T19:40:00.000Z	jrib	mamece2	did your error actually say "temp" or was that a typo on your part?
2011-12-04T19:41:00.000Z	mamece2	jrib	it was a typo. it says /tmp/
2011-12-04T19:41:00.000Z	jrib	mamece2	can you pastebin the error in its entirety?
2011-12-04T19:41:00.000Z	mamece2	jrib	i think i cant, i am testing all in an old pc without network
2011-12-04T19:42:00.000Z	jrib	mamece2	ok
2011-12-04T19:42:00.000Z	jrib	mamece2	can you write to /tmp?
2011-12-04T19:43:00.000Z	mamece2	jrib	can i try with nano?
2011-12-04T19:43:00.000Z	jrib	mamece2	sure, try: nano /tmp/mamece2test
