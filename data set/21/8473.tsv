2006-04-26T08:45:00.000Z	sharp		does ubuntu setup a root password by default?
2006-04-26T08:45:00.000Z	sharp		if so .. i dont know what it is
2006-04-26T08:45:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	sharp	nope ! no default password.
2006-04-26T08:46:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	sharp	sudo is your man.
2006-04-26T08:47:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	sharp	ops ! you got to get your repos first.
2006-04-26T08:47:00.000Z	sharp	|lostbyte|	i am trying to install a game that is on a networked drive.  BUT i dont know how to do that.
2006-04-26T08:47:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	sharp	Game ? its a .deb ?
2006-04-26T08:48:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	sharp	.deb - debian package.
2006-04-26T08:48:00.000Z	sharp	|lostbyte|	it actually runs on a script per the website. Www.grubbygames.com Professor Fizzlewizzle... like game.sh
2006-04-26T08:48:00.000Z	sharp	|lostbyte|	it's on my husband's drive.
2006-04-26T08:49:00.000Z	sharp	|lostbyte|	i installed samba because that's needed? and also nfs? BUT I am unsure as to what to do next.
2006-04-26T08:49:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	sharp	IF its a .sh run it. does that site have a manual.. follow it. ok.. i'll check..
2006-04-26T08:51:00.000Z	sharp	|lostbyte|	oh ..running the game is not the problem.. just bringing it over to my laptop drive. My husband is not here...so I forgot to ask him how to bring files from his system to mine.
2006-04-26T08:51:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	sharp	His system is a windows ?
2006-04-26T08:52:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	sharp	Open up konqueror and type smb://<husband's pc's name> and your in.
2006-04-26T08:52:00.000Z	sharp	|lostbyte|	ok..  :-)
2006-04-26T08:59:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	sharp	man interfaces
2006-04-26T08:59:00.000Z	sharp	|lostbyte|	so there is no command to setup your network?
2006-04-26T09:02:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	sharp	Not that i know of.. but you do have that option as you install..
2006-04-26T09:02:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	sharp	just a few lines in the /etc/network/interfaces you got to add and your good to go.
