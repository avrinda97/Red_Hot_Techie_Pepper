2008-09-04T00:23:00.000Z	azlon		how can i remove loopback from my nic?
2008-09-04T00:23:00.000Z	Pici	azlon	you don't.
2008-09-04T00:23:00.000Z	Pici	azlon	The system uses to to talk to itself, if you know what I mean.
2008-09-04T00:24:00.000Z	azlon	Pici	cat /etc/network/interfaces give me auto lo     iface lo inet loopback
2008-09-04T00:25:00.000Z	Pici	azlon	You can remove it, but most likely things will fail to work afterwards.
2008-09-04T00:25:00.000Z	azlon	Pici	does this mean that it doesnt see my nic?
2008-09-04T00:25:00.000Z	azlon	Pici	doesnt work now anyway, cant get worse, right?
2008-09-04T00:25:00.000Z	azlon	Pici	how can i remove it?
2008-09-04T00:25:00.000Z	Pici	azlon	If you only see lo, and you have a nic, then yes, it doesnt see your nic.
2008-09-04T00:26:00.000Z	Pici	azlon	I'm not going to tell you how to remove it because it will cause issues.
2008-09-04T00:26:00.000Z	azlon	Pici	so because i only see those two lines (auto lo           and            iface lo inet loopback)... that means ubuntu doesnt see my nic
2009-03-05T18:39:00.000Z	Pici	azlon	What do you mean by above?
2009-07-08T22:28:00.000Z	Pici	azlon	iwconfig
2009-07-08T22:28:00.000Z	Pici	azlon	ifconfig and iwconfig will give you a list of your interface names
2009-07-08T22:29:00.000Z	azlon	Pici	thanks, that worked
2009-09-17T19:20:00.000Z	Pici	azlon	who | wc -l ?
2009-09-17T19:21:00.000Z	azlon	Pici	that returned 1
2009-09-17T19:21:00.000Z	Pici	azlon	wc -l counts the number of lines,
2009-09-17T19:22:00.000Z	azlon	Pici	oh that is because i had to disable my eth0 so i could use the internet and ask the question in here
2009-09-17T19:23:00.000Z	Pici	azlon	Sorry, I mistabbed my response, it wasn't for you :)
2010-06-23T22:13:00.000Z	Pici	azlon	Modify /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default , the virtualhost line specifies what port it is listening on.
