2011-09-21T01:55:00.000Z	qFox		quick question, whats the current default desktop UI for ubuntu (11.04) called? and what was it's predecessor called?
2011-09-21T01:55:00.000Z	qFox		ah unity, that's right
2011-09-21T01:55:00.000Z	qFox		thanks :)
2011-09-21T01:57:00.000Z	Ibyss1	qFox	Are you having troubles seeing icons on the left side of your screen when you're in unity?
2011-09-21T01:57:00.000Z	qFox		i removed unity. i think it's a serious p.o.s.
2011-09-21T01:57:00.000Z	qFox		i'm using classic desktop, so GNOME :)
2011-09-21T01:57:00.000Z	Ibyss1	qFox	But did you?
2011-09-21T01:57:00.000Z	qFox		uh, no, i saw the icons on the left. in the OSX kind of way
2011-09-21T01:58:00.000Z	qFox		but creating new ones is just madness, imho
2011-09-21T01:58:00.000Z	Ibyss1		Alrighties. For some reason, mines is just missing icons
2011-09-21T01:58:00.000Z	qFox		whoever thought of that should be ... well.
2011-09-21T01:58:00.000Z	qFox		what do you mean with missing?
2011-09-21T01:58:00.000Z	qFox		the bar is there though?
2011-09-21T01:58:00.000Z	Ibyss1		Yea. The name of the app appears only if I "over where the icons should be at".
2011-09-21T01:59:00.000Z	qFox		sounds like a bug, but as you might be able to tell i'm not that much of an expert myself
2011-09-21T01:59:00.000Z	Ibyss1		It's like this picture here: http://i.imgur.com/Wa4Xx.jpg
2011-09-21T01:59:00.000Z	Ibyss1		ALrighties.
2011-09-21T01:59:00.000Z	qFox		have you tried widening it?
2011-09-21T01:59:00.000Z	Ibyss1		I will just use Ubuntu classic.
2011-09-21T01:59:00.000Z	qFox		i've actually fixed a silly bug with vertical rendering with the panels package manually :s
2011-09-21T02:00:00.000Z	qFox	Ibyss1	do you plan on having a vertical bar again?
