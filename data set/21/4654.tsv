2010-03-31T05:54:00.000Z	chelz	jmspeex	there's probably a script somewhere that runs when the powerstate changes

2010-03-31T05:55:00.000Z	jmspeex	chelz	That's what I assume, but which one. I find it annoying that not only is Ubuntu not attempting to help, it's actively hurting
2010-03-31T05:56:00.000Z	chelz	jmspeex	a distro is not going to be able to instantly know every use scenario it might encounter. it's a work in progress. if you feel strongly about it, once you resolve this you can make sure it's a known bug.
2010-03-31T05:56:00.000Z	jmspeex	chelz	Well, it appears from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DanielHahler/Bug59695 that it's already far too well known
2010-03-31T05:57:00.000Z	chelz	jmspeex	if that's your bug then the workarounds should work. do the workarounds work for you?
2010-03-31T05:58:00.000Z	jmspeex	chelz	The work around of doing a "hdparm -B 255" works -- except that Ubuntu sets it back to 1 (or whatever it is) every time I unplug the AC adaptor. That's why I say it's actively doing harm
2010-03-31T05:59:00.000Z	chelz	jmspeex	sounds like whatever is setting it to 1 could be used to set it to 255
2010-03-31T06:00:00.000Z	jmspeex	chelz	Sure, but what is it? And *why* is it doing that in the first place?
2010-03-31T06:01:00.000Z	chelz	jmspeex	reading over this might help, it's the bug linked to at the top of that wiki page: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpi-support/+bug/59695
2010-03-31T06:01:00.000Z	chelz	jmspeex	that bug seems to be set to 'fix released'
2010-03-31T06:02:00.000Z	jmspeex	chelz	"fix released" for what version. It definitely isn't fixed on Karmic
2010-03-31T06:02:00.000Z	chelz	jmspeex	that leads me to believe it's not what you're experiencing
2010-03-31T06:04:00.000Z	jmspeex	chelz	Actually, I just saw that my laptop mode config file sets "1" for the HD power management when on battery. Doesn't look very intelligent as far as I'm concerned
2010-03-31T06:04:00.000Z	chelz	jmspeex	check if there's a bug filed for it
2010-03-31T06:05:00.000Z	jmspeex	chelz	Well, you just pointed to the bug
2010-03-31T06:06:00.000Z	chelz	jmspeex	make sure that bug actually applies to you before reopening it. it is marked fixed afterall
2010-03-31T06:06:00.000Z	chelz	jmspeex	can't help ya then
2010-03-31T06:06:00.000Z	jmspeex	chelz	Well, at least you helped in pointing me to the right config file
2010-03-31T06:06:00.000Z	chelz	jmspeex	it's more than filing, you have to keep up with the bug and help maintainers fix it
