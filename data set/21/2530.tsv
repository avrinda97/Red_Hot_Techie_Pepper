2010-08-04T13:12:00.000Z	classical		Someone give me a advice plz :(((
2010-08-04T13:14:00.000Z	Ileden	classical	People most probably aren't ignoring you, only they aren't confident enough to provide an answer. No need for sadfaces :)
2010-08-04T13:17:00.000Z	Ileden	classical	from what I know, it should be run as the user that you want to be executing the task. If you're doing root tasks, then root is the right user. If not, maybe not.
2010-08-04T13:17:00.000Z	classical	Ileden	soreau ubottu thx you guys :-)  but If i run a some script wit root is there any secure  vulnerability ?  :-)
2010-08-04T13:18:00.000Z	Ileden	classical	depends on the script, of course. Yes, it's a vulnerability. But a perfectly secure system is one that isn't powered up at all...
2010-08-04T13:19:00.000Z	classical	Ileden	Okay thank you :-)
2010-08-04T13:20:00.000Z	Ileden	classical	Just think of it in the way that that script can then do whatever it pleases with your system. And if someone gets to modify that script, he can then do anything with the system. Or if that scripts ask initiates some other process, that process (or anything that has managed to modify it) can do whatever they want with your system.
2010-08-04T13:23:00.000Z	classical	Ileden	soreau Yep :-)   but if i need a root privilege to run scripts ? there are some scripts which does not run with simple user :-)
2010-08-04T13:25:00.000Z	Ileden	classical	well there are two approaches. Give the user that should run the script enough privlidges to run it, or let root run the script. Well, there's a third option too, to lower the required rights of the system the script uses, so any user gets to run it, but that's not a good idea.
2010-08-04T13:29:00.000Z	classical	Ileden	its seems the best solution to give users enough privilege for executing scripts but does not allow to edit it
2010-08-04T13:30:00.000Z	Ileden	classical	"does not allow to edit it"?
2010-08-04T13:30:00.000Z	classical	Ileden	for users
2010-08-04T13:42:00.000Z	Ileden	classical	because root has "vi" as the designated editor program (i guess)
2010-08-04T13:43:00.000Z	classical	Ileden	then sudo -e must be  opened with vi
2010-08-04T13:43:00.000Z	Ileden	classical	and sudo doesn't run the command as root, but with root privlidges (as far as I understand), so it still uses the user's designated editor config, while sudo su enters actual root mode, using the root's config.
2010-08-04T13:45:00.000Z	classical	Ileden	i guess you are right :-) PythonPup why ?
2010-08-04T13:46:00.000Z	Ileden	classical	maybe - just an educated guess, I'd like to know it myself too :)
2010-08-04T14:43:00.000Z	classical	Ileden	i set crontab   here is source 40 13 * * * /usr/bin/firefox
2010-08-04T15:35:00.000Z	classical	Ileden	http://pastebin.com/yUHkVUPb this does not works why ?  :-(  i executing this bash script but no email in my inbox :-((
2010-08-04T15:37:00.000Z	Ileden	classical	I'm not much familiar with /usr/bin/mail... but I'd guess your mail configuration isn't correct.
2010-08-04T15:38:00.000Z	classical	Ileden	haha its works but sents a "mail" in a /home/classical by creating textmail.txt
