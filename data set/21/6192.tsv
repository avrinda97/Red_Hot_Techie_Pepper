2007-05-15T09:05:00.000Z	orbin	zabin	did you try that link?
2007-05-15T09:06:00.000Z	orbin	zabin	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org  pastebin your xorg.conf file
2007-05-15T09:11:00.000Z	orbin	zabin	does "sudo ddcprobe | grep monitorrange" return anything?
2007-05-15T09:12:00.000Z	orbin	zabin	install xresprobe, then re-run
2007-05-15T09:13:00.000Z	orbin	zabin	yep
2007-05-15T09:15:00.000Z	zabin	orbin	it returned nothing
2007-05-15T09:16:00.000Z	orbin	zabin	ok, my stab is that your monitor's rates are wrong.  you can't autodetect via that command.  what monitor do you have?
2007-05-15T09:17:00.000Z	orbin	zabin	can you find a specific model number on it?
2007-05-15T09:18:00.000Z	zabin	orbin	it says trinitron in the top right corner.
2007-05-15T09:19:00.000Z	zabin	orbin	ultraScan p780
2007-05-15T09:20:00.000Z	orbin	zabin	that should be it. one sec
2007-05-15T09:22:00.000Z	orbin	zabin	certain it's 19 inch?
2007-05-15T09:29:00.000Z	zabin	orbin	any news?
2007-05-15T09:30:00.000Z	orbin	zabin	i was trying to look up your monitor specs, but i can only see the p780 in 17-inch form: http://support.ap.dell.com/support/systemsinfo/documentation.aspx?c=au&l=en&s=gen&~cat=3&~subcat=49
2007-05-15T09:31:00.000Z	zabin	orbin	do you think that the monitor really has that much effect on it?
2007-05-15T09:32:00.000Z	orbin	zabin	well i've seen incorrect specs affect resolution before
2007-05-15T09:34:00.000Z	zabin	orbin	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg that fixes the screen size but then the card doesnt really work for 3d stuff
2007-05-15T09:35:00.000Z	orbin	zabin	yeah, i don't have an nvidia card, so can't really troubleshoot that, sorry.
2007-05-15T09:35:00.000Z	zabin	orbin	thanks for your help : P
