2010-06-06T18:12:00.000Z	the_madman	jrib	I'll check it out, thanks.
2010-06-06T18:16:00.000Z	the_madman	jrib	Ah, that's not quite what I needed.
2010-06-06T18:17:00.000Z	jrib	the_madman	in what sense?
2010-06-06T18:18:00.000Z	the_madman	jrib	Well, the computer I'm connecting to has to act as a server for the other computer. What I was hoping for was that the client would connect to the server, then present a log-in window for the user to transparently log in under an account on the server.
2010-06-06T18:19:00.000Z	jrib	the_madman	isn't that what vnc does?  Are you actually trying to do some sort of thinclient setup?
2010-06-06T18:19:00.000Z	the_madman	jrib	Yeah, a thin client setup.

2010-06-06T18:20:00.000Z	the_madman	jrib	That's one of the first pages I came to. Is it still relevant?
2010-06-06T18:20:00.000Z	jrib	the_madman	I don't know
2010-06-06T18:21:00.000Z	the_madman	jrib	I'll have a look over it anyway. Thanks.
2010-06-06T18:46:00.000Z	the_madman	jrib	Problem.
2010-06-06T18:46:00.000Z	the_madman	jrib	You know I was setting up a thin-client server?
2010-06-06T18:46:00.000Z	jrib	the_madman	right?
2010-06-06T18:47:00.000Z	the_madman	jrib	The client machine isn't a dedicated thin-client. It's just a normal computer.
2010-06-06T18:48:00.000Z	the_madman	jrib	I'll have a play and look around, see what I can get it to do.
2010-06-06T18:49:00.000Z	jrib	the_madman	then you want vnc... no?
2010-06-06T18:49:00.000Z	the_madman	jrib	Well, VNC is for accessing an already running remote desktop, isn't it?
2010-06-06T18:50:00.000Z	jrib	the_madman	not necessarily
2010-06-06T18:50:00.000Z	the_madman	jrib	Oooh. I'll have to look deeper into it then.
2010-06-06T18:51:00.000Z	jrib	the_madman	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC/Servers I think discusses what you want explicitly
