2005-10-02T16:22:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	NiCKeL	I'm checking...
2005-10-02T16:23:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	NiCKeL	I think the easiest way is: "ifdown eth0" and then "ifup eth0"
2005-10-02T16:23:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	NiCKeL	Of course that assumes the interface is called eth0, but that's the norm.
2005-10-02T16:25:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	NiCKeL	Let me know how it goes.
2005-10-02T16:27:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	NiCKeL	are you using a static address or DHCP?
2005-10-02T16:27:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	NiCKeL	at home or in the office?
2005-10-02T16:28:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	NiCKeL	do other pc's on the net work?
2005-10-02T16:31:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	NiCKeL	Sorry, trying to help 2 a t a time... Is it DHCP?
2005-10-02T16:32:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	NiCKeL	That's the loopback, ignore that... No eth0 ??
2005-10-02T16:36:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	NiCKeL	The password is the same as the password that you created for your user
2005-10-02T16:36:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	NiCKeL	Try sudo ifconfig
2005-10-02T16:36:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	NiCKeL	Te same as for the user you created
2005-10-02T16:40:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	NiCKeL	I lost you... I've gotta go now...
