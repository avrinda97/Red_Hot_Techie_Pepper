2007-11-17T19:42:00.000Z	minus198		is there a way to make a file to automatically open in a prefered program by just entering the filename in a terminal? Like: "file.png" should automatically do: "gthumb file.png" ?
2007-11-17T19:42:00.000Z	jrib	minus198	gnome-open
2007-11-17T19:43:00.000Z	minus198	jrib	that isn't rly what I want. I only want to do: "file.png" without having to type anything before that..
2007-11-17T19:44:00.000Z	jrib	minus198	what shell do you use?
2007-11-17T19:44:00.000Z	minus198	jrib	its gnome-terminal,
2007-11-17T19:44:00.000Z	jrib	minus198	that's a terminal emulator.  Did you change the default from bash?
2007-11-17T19:45:00.000Z	minus198	jrib	ehm.. What do you mean?
2007-11-17T19:46:00.000Z	jrib	minus198	type 'getent passwd $USER'
2007-11-17T19:46:00.000Z	minus198	jrib	minus:x:1000:1000:Sebastian Grans,,,:/home/minus:/bin/bash
2007-11-17T19:47:00.000Z	jrib	minus198	bash then, I ask because I think I remember some way to do it in zsh.  You should probably try #bash
2007-11-17T19:47:00.000Z	minus198	jrib	ok, thanks :)
2007-11-17T19:48:00.000Z	jrib	minus198	actually, one idea may be to see how command-not-found runs when a command is not found by the shell and hook into that the same way
2007-11-17T19:49:00.000Z	minus198	jrib	ok..
2007-11-17T20:11:00.000Z	jrib	minus198	have you figured out the bash thing?
2007-11-17T20:11:00.000Z	minus198	jrib	nope :/
2007-11-17T20:12:00.000Z	jrib	minus198	command_not_found_handle() will get executed when a command is not found by bash
2007-11-17T20:13:00.000Z	minus198	jrib	yeah, bur I don't know what to do next
2007-11-17T20:14:00.000Z	jrib	minus198	check that the file exists and call gnome-open on it
2007-11-17T20:14:00.000Z	minus198	jrib	yeah, but how :/
2007-11-17T20:15:00.000Z	jrib	minus198	google for "advanced bash scripting guide"
2007-11-17T20:17:00.000Z	jrib	minus198	and http://tinyurl.com/2xv4f5 tells you how the command-not-found program uses it
