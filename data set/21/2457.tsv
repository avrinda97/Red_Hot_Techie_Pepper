2009-10-05T21:35:00.000Z	blarghle		I'm very confused,,, I've got a partition that says there are 26G in use, but there are only 18k in use by files(including hidden and trash).  Where could my 26G of files have disappeared to?
2009-10-05T21:36:00.000Z	blarghle		I know I had all of those files there
2009-10-05T21:36:00.000Z	playya	blarghle	tried a df -hs /path/to/dir/* ?
2009-10-05T21:38:00.000Z	blarghle	playya	df: invalid option -- 's'
2009-10-05T21:40:00.000Z	blarghle	playya	25 GB confirmed in use without option 's'
2009-10-05T21:40:00.000Z	playya	blarghle	its du not df. sorry
2009-10-05T21:41:00.000Z	blarghle	playya	again, 25G confirmed in use
2009-10-05T21:41:00.000Z	playya	blarghle	added the * at the end?
2009-10-05T21:43:00.000Z	blarghle	playya	however, I do get "du: cannot access `/media/truecrypt1/home/default/.gconfd': Stale NFS file handle" but I don't think that's related
2009-10-05T21:44:00.000Z	playya	blarghle	remount it.
2009-10-05T21:46:00.000Z	blarghle	playya	this is the third time i've mounted it with the same result
2009-10-05T21:47:00.000Z	blarghle	playya	the last time i saw it working properly, I was trying to copy the data to a larger partition, and I had to cancel because the computer had to be shut downI was trying to copy the data from one volume
2009-10-05T21:48:00.000Z	playya	blarghle	do you use a vfat partition?
2009-10-05T21:48:00.000Z	blarghle	playya	no, it's ext3
2009-10-05T21:48:00.000Z	blarghle	playya	both are
2009-10-05T21:49:00.000Z	playya	blarghle	can you ls the error?
2009-10-05T21:49:00.000Z	blarghle	playya	ls?
2009-10-05T21:51:00.000Z	blarghle	playya	BRILIANT!
2009-10-05T21:51:00.000Z	playya	blarghle	ehhh. the file. i had a simliar error, but can't remember how to solve it
2009-10-05T21:52:00.000Z	blarghle	playya	 I can cd to it in the terminal.  I'll try finishing the move operation with terminal commands
