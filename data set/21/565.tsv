2011-10-06T22:09:00.000Z	m3talh3ad		hello
2011-10-06T22:10:00.000Z	m3talh3ad		may i ask a question?
2011-10-06T22:10:00.000Z	glebihan	m3talh3ad	sure, just ask, don't ask to ask
2011-10-06T22:11:00.000Z	glebihan	m3talh3ad	not at all
2011-10-06T22:13:00.000Z	glebihan	m3talh3ad	well gnome is still the desktop environment, but unity is now the default shell that runs over gnome
2011-10-06T22:18:00.000Z	glebihan	m3talh3ad	with gnome3 you can still use the gnome-fallback-session and gnome-panel which is very similar to gnome2
2011-10-06T22:18:00.000Z	m3talh3ad	glebihan	thnks
2011-10-06T22:27:00.000Z	glebihan	m3talh3ad	no it doesn't work with tail -f because the history is only written at the end of the bash process (ie when you quit the terminal)
2011-10-06T22:28:00.000Z	m3talh3ad	glebihan	i want to make a script that logs history to another file
2011-10-06T22:28:00.000Z	m3talh3ad	glebihan	do you have any suggestions?
2011-10-06T22:28:00.000Z	glebihan	m3talh3ad	just copy the file ?
2011-10-06T22:28:00.000Z	m3talh3ad	glebihan	no
2011-10-06T22:29:00.000Z	m3talh3ad	glebihan	reads the output of the command history, and logs it in real time in the file i want
2011-10-06T22:29:00.000Z	glebihan	m3talh3ad	you can't
2011-10-06T22:30:00.000Z	m3talh3ad	glebihan	ok thnks. i will check it out with python maybe
2011-10-06T22:30:00.000Z	glebihan	m3talh3ad	what do you mean "check it out with python" ?
2011-10-06T22:31:00.000Z	m3talh3ad	glebihan	i mean that i will write something in python. sorry my english is not very good
2011-10-06T22:31:00.000Z	glebihan	m3talh3ad	I got that, but what do you to do with python ?
2011-10-06T22:32:00.000Z	glebihan	m3talh3ad	whatever language you use you won't be able to access commands in real-time unless you modify bash itself
2011-10-06T22:32:00.000Z	m3talh3ad	glebihan	i am gonna find a way to do this with python. dont know exactly what, yet
2011-10-06T22:32:00.000Z	m3talh3ad	glebihan	ok i wiil keep that in mind
