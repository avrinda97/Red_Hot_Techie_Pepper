2012-09-22T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	blackshirt	why do you think you're box will become slow because of a zombie process you don't even know what it is, and if you did know what it was wouldn't change anything
2012-09-22T13:10:00.000Z	ikonia	blackshirt	if you want to clear it, reboot
2012-09-22T13:10:00.000Z	blackshirt	ikonia	is good to know what the process is...? And what command to show the zombie?
2012-09-22T13:10:00.000Z	ikonia	blackshirt	why is it good to know ? what good will it do you ?
2012-09-22T13:11:00.000Z	blackshirt	ikonia	i just want to know..if you don't want to help, it's no matter
2012-09-22T13:11:00.000Z	ikonia	blackshirt	if you are genuinly concerned about a zombie process, reboot
