2010-02-05T20:24:00.000Z	darkfuneral		i don't see a /dev/md0 device, does ubuntu 9.10 live not have RAID1 capabilities by default?
2010-02-05T20:25:00.000Z	darkfuneral		anyone know?
2010-02-05T20:25:00.000Z	darkfuneral		how the fuck do i mount my raid1 array in ubnutu 9.10 live?
2010-02-05T20:26:00.000Z	ikonia	darkfuneral	control your language please
2010-02-05T20:26:00.000Z	ikonia	darkfuneral	don't use bad language
2010-02-05T20:28:00.000Z	darkfuneral	ikonia	do you know the answer to my question, because frankly im infuriated
2010-02-05T20:28:00.000Z	ikonia	darkfuneral	I understand that, is it a hardware/software/fakeraid partition you want to mouont ?
2010-02-05T20:29:00.000Z	darkfuneral	ikonia	its software raid
2010-02-05T20:29:00.000Z	ikonia	darkfuneral	as in linux software raid or windows sofwware raid ?
2010-02-05T20:29:00.000Z	darkfuneral	ikonia	im pretty sure id on't have to create md0 myself, kernel is supposed to make it
2010-02-05T20:29:00.000Z	darkfuneral	ikonia	linux software raid1
2010-02-05T20:29:00.000Z	ikonia	darkfuneral	perfect, if you start the array udev should create the md file for you
2010-02-05T20:31:00.000Z	darkfuneral	ikonia	how am i suppose t o start it?
2010-02-05T20:31:00.000Z	ikonia	darkfuneral	mdadm, do you know how to use it ?
2010-02-05T20:32:00.000Z	ikonia	darkfuneral	ok, so start the array, check /proc/mdstat for the array status, then mount it
2010-02-05T20:32:00.000Z	ikonia	darkfuneral	I'd get that installed then, as that's the problem
2010-02-05T20:32:00.000Z	darkfuneral	ikonia	you sure the kern is capable of arrays?
2010-02-05T20:33:00.000Z	ikonia	darkfuneral	not off the top of my head, but I'd suspect so as it's the same kernel as the install
2010-02-05T20:34:00.000Z	ikonia	darkfuneral	what's it asking you for ?
2010-02-05T20:36:00.000Z	darkfuneral	ikonia	so you're saying i don't have to create the array with mdadm, i can just start it?
2010-02-05T20:37:00.000Z	darkfuneral	ikonia	in this case, i don't know how to start it as it seems starting it just means you mount it
