2007-11-02T00:15:00.000Z	SevenSeth		sorry everyone
2007-11-02T00:16:00.000Z	SevenSeth		but i'm very worried about this problem
2007-11-02T00:16:00.000Z	SevenSeth		i don't want loose my hdd
2007-11-02T00:17:00.000Z	cleaton	SevenSeth	have you tried any of the sugestions on launchpad?
2007-11-02T00:20:00.000Z	SevenSeth	cleaton	but you was affected about the same problem?
2007-11-02T00:21:00.000Z	cleaton	SevenSeth	i think you can overide the firmware/bios settings using hdparm
2007-11-02T00:22:00.000Z	cleaton	SevenSeth	you have enabeled laptop-mode?
2007-11-02T00:22:00.000Z	SevenSeth	cleaton	i think not , i didn't change anything
2007-11-02T00:23:00.000Z	SevenSeth	cleaton	but using hdparm -B 255 is the solution?
2007-11-02T00:24:00.000Z	cleaton	SevenSeth	i think that should disable any powermanegment on the disk
2007-11-02T00:25:00.000Z	SevenSeth	cleaton	/ squee yes. the lanchpad recommends to create a script that runs when ubuntu starts executing this command
2007-11-02T00:25:00.000Z	SevenSeth	cleaton	/ squee so, until now the solution is using hdparm -B 255
2007-11-02T00:26:00.000Z	cleaton	SevenSeth	well there's no sulotion on it, it's in the firmware or bios if i have understood it correct, ubuntu isn't doing anychanges
2007-11-02T00:27:00.000Z	cleaton	SevenSeth	ubuntu goes by the thought that the manufacture knows what your hardware can handle. so it leaves the firmware/bios to do the job by default that's why laptop mode is disabled
2007-11-02T00:28:00.000Z	SevenSeth	cleaton	so my manufacter sells me a notebook with an hddthat that is destinated to diw before the time expected...
2007-11-02T00:28:00.000Z	SevenSeth	cleaton	how i can be sure if my laptop-mode is disabled?
2007-11-02T00:31:00.000Z	cleaton	SevenSeth	i don't know how you check that, sorry. it seems like they do, not everyone has that problem. windows seem to overide the bios/firmware settings so maybe it's some kind of trick they use to keep them on windows or something i don't know it seems strange
2007-11-02T00:33:00.000Z	cleaton	SevenSeth	even if you use hdparm -b 255 it will still use the firmware when you go in suspend forexample. and then you can see that you will get the same cycle rate again
2007-11-02T00:33:00.000Z	SevenSeth	cleaton	yeah...but what is the diferance in this comand hdparm -B255 /dev/sda > /dev/null 2>&1 ??
2007-11-02T00:34:00.000Z	cleaton	SevenSeth	so they might know that windows changes it and they use their a bit too agressive when the computer is in suspend but they think that it's ok as you're not in suspend so often and then it could be better to earn some battery time
2007-11-02T00:34:00.000Z	cleaton	SevenSeth	i don't know i haven't used hdparm so much, you could try man hdparm
