2012-07-15T00:01:00.000Z	amews_aj-study		Why does wipe show a size of 14823232 on a 243 GB partition ? Isn't the number the size of the partition? There is a difference of factor 16384 - maybe block size or something ?
2012-07-15T00:02:00.000Z	amews_aj-study		utility that can be used to wipe files, partitions or entire hdd
2012-07-15T00:03:00.000Z	amews_aj-study		Can anyone confirm "wipe" is using 16 kb blocks ? I would like to be sure everything is fine. Can't find any documentation saying anything about it.
2012-07-15T00:05:00.000Z	Random832	amews_aj-study	if you're worried, put something at the end of the disk and verify that it's gone after it runs
2012-07-15T00:05:00.000Z	Random832		personally i think wipe is overkill unless you've got the NSA after you
2012-07-15T00:06:00.000Z	amews_aj-study	Random832	it does seem to be empty - but I would like to be sure, since the hdd might be sold to someone else afterwards.
2012-07-15T00:09:00.000Z	Random832	amews_aj-study	is that person an NSA agent?
2012-07-15T00:09:00.000Z	Random832		anyway, just put something in that space before running wipe - either wipe will run properly on that region or it won't touch it at all
2012-07-15T00:09:00.000Z	amews_aj-study	Random832	Random, but most likely not - but does that really matter? I don't want someone to be able to restore data that could contain passwords or other personal data.
2012-07-15T00:10:00.000Z	amews_aj-study		I am not saying I want to run 42 wipes with different random write techniques, I just don't want to leave it simply reformatting the partition table.
2012-07-15T00:10:00.000Z	Random832	amews_aj-study	just use dd if=/dev/zero of=disk
2012-07-15T00:11:00.000Z	Random832		that's good enough for anyone who doesn't have an electron microscope
2012-07-15T00:11:00.000Z	Random832		using if=/dev/urandom might be good enough even if they do - stuff like shred and wipe is for the super paranoid
2012-07-15T00:12:00.000Z	amews_aj-study	Random832	from what I read shred/wipe simply overwrites the hdd with random bits. I guess doing a single such pass is not paranoid ?
2012-07-15T00:14:00.000Z	Random832	amews_aj-study	well there are different degrees of paranoid - a single pass isn't that much more difficult than overwriting with zero, so it's not a big deal
2012-07-15T00:15:00.000Z	Random832		but there are some people who insist on 25 of specific patterns and then multiple passes of randomness
2012-07-15T00:15:00.000Z	amews_aj-study	Random832	agreed, I wasn't looking for random bit overwrite. Zero would have been ok. I don't use linux as my primary OS, so I just searched for a way to wipe a disk in linux (livecd), and found the "wipe" utility.
2012-07-15T00:16:00.000Z	Random832	amews_aj-study	well the traditional way is dd if=/dev/zero of=disk
2012-07-15T00:16:00.000Z	amews_aj-study	Random832	 Great to know :)
2012-07-15T00:16:00.000Z	Random832		oh and bs=1M - default dd block size is slow as all hell
2012-07-15T00:18:00.000Z	amews_aj-study	Random832	The "wipe" completed hours ago - I guess it should be fine, right?
