2008-12-16T21:47:00.000Z	Stormx2		I still can't get this network to work. the "ifupdown (eth0)" device listed in System>Preferences>Network is malconfigured, I CAN'T edit it, I can't delete it. Adding another config does nothing. I'm completely stumped. Any ideas?
2008-12-16T21:48:00.000Z	n8tuser	Stormx2	-> can you elaborate on your network layout? whats connected to which?
2008-12-16T21:49:00.000Z	Stormx2	n8tuser	one ethernet card, eth0. wired up to the router. I don't care if it's DHCP or static. I can ping stuff but not resolve addresses, because there is no default nameserver defined. I can't define it, it says it's read only. Also the netmask has mysteriously been set to "4". My brother plugged his phone in yesterday evening and BAM! this happened.
