2006-07-11T11:41:00.000Z	morrolan		Can someone please tell me how to check if a particular service or daemon is running?
2006-07-11T11:41:00.000Z	LjL	morrolan	ps aux | grep nameofthedaemon   can usually do that
2006-07-20T15:47:00.000Z	LjL	morrolan	aptitude is best for that
2007-02-10T10:22:00.000Z	LjL	morrolan	you can always boot the old kernel from GRUB in any event
2007-02-10T10:22:00.000Z	morrolan	LjL	good point, I'd forgotten about that
2007-03-14T13:21:00.000Z	LjL	morrolan	sudo apt-get install packagename=versionname, if the version is actually available
2007-03-14T13:22:00.000Z	LjL	morrolan	in your case that would probably be  sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa=6.5.1-20060817
2007-03-14T13:29:00.000Z	LjL	morrolan	gunzip filename.run.gz
2007-03-14T13:30:00.000Z	LjL	morrolan	....
2007-03-14T13:36:00.000Z	LjL	morrolan	1) have you not read or not tried the solution i did give you?
2007-03-14T13:36:00.000Z	morrolan	LjL	I'm sorry, I must have missed it?  When was this?
2007-03-14T13:36:00.000Z	LjL	morrolan	2) you left earlier about the gz file issue, but the answer you were given was correct and totally not sarcastic. you use "tar" un extract a "tar" file, not a "gz" file. for that you use "gunzip".
2007-03-14T13:37:00.000Z	morrolan	LjL	I know that, it wasn't you that my comment was aimed at.  I know that the information was correct because it has since worked, but it was the way the information was delivered seemed quite sarcastic to me.  Anyway, it's in the past, and the important thing is, is that the information worked.
2007-03-14T13:38:00.000Z	LjL	morrolan	ok. "tar" has the "added bonus" of being able to extract gz and bz2 files too -- which is probably the reason you tried to use "tar" in the first place -- *but* only when they shrink-wrap a .tar file, like in .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 files
2007-03-14T13:39:00.000Z	morrolan	LjL	, I've tried that with libglu1 before and just tried again, and the error I get is: E: Version '6.5.1-20060817' for 'libglu1-mesa' was not found
2007-03-14T13:39:00.000Z	LjL	morrolan	then you simply don't have that version available from the repositories, i'm afraid. what was the program that's asking for it?
2007-03-14T13:52:00.000Z	morrolan	LjL	I figured out how to do it :)  In Synaptic, I selected the libglu1-mesa package, clicked properties, clicked the "Versions" tab, and it then tells you how to force an older version by selecting the package, going to the "Package" menu, and then "Force Version".  Certainly useful to know!
2007-03-14T13:52:00.000Z	LjL	morrolan	well but it's the same thing as apt-get install package=version i think... at least it should
2007-03-14T13:52:00.000Z	LjL	morrolan	try with a slash :)
