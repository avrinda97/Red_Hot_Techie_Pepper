2012-09-21T19:41:00.000Z	k4r1m		tried it numerous times with no luck, it just kept crashing or telling me version 5.5 is not support which is like exchange 1998
2012-09-21T19:41:00.000Z	k4r1m		1997*
2012-09-21T19:42:00.000Z	k4r1m		I really thought there would be proper support for exchange 2010 on linux... Do I really have to run vm to get this crap working?
2012-09-21T19:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	k4r1m	exchange is MS prioritary "email" and your surprised it doesn't work....
2012-09-23T02:16:00.000Z	zykotick9	k4r1m	[ i can't help you ] but are you using 12.10?  if so, resolv.conf is deprecated... you're having "internet/DNS" issues right?  are you using N-M?  if so, resolv.conf wouldn't help anyways (i believe)
2012-09-23T02:16:00.000Z	zykotick9	k4r1m	sorry s/12.10/12.04/ !!!
2012-09-23T02:17:00.000Z	k4r1m	zykotick9	I'm on 12.04, resolv.conf is deprecated?
2012-09-23T02:17:00.000Z	zykotick9	k4r1m	yes
2012-09-23T02:17:00.000Z	zykotick9	k4r1m	are you using Network-Manager?
2012-09-23T02:17:00.000Z	zykotick9	k4r1m	double-yes
2012-09-23T02:19:00.000Z	k4r1m	zykotick9	LIAR
2012-09-23T02:19:00.000Z	zykotick9	k4r1m	sorry (i don't see either TJ- or Meris's comments to you - so i don't know what you're hearing) but resolv.conf is deprecated in 12.04 and most of it's setting have been moved to /etc/network/interfaces (i believe!).  certainly don't follow ANY of my advice without confirmation from someone in the channel.
2012-09-23T02:20:00.000Z	zykotick9	k4r1m	LIAR - i don't think so.  resolv.conf is deprecated.
2012-09-23T02:20:00.000Z	zykotick9	k4r1m	reboot.
2012-09-23T02:24:00.000Z	k4r1m	zykotick9	still working... :D
2012-09-23T02:25:00.000Z	zykotick9	k4r1m	nice.  good luck.
2012-09-23T02:25:00.000Z	k4r1m	zykotick9	I'll sure need it
2012-09-23T02:35:00.000Z	zykotick9	k4r1m	for one thing, using /etc/network/interfaces disables network-manager (the default networking on ubuntu)...
2012-09-23T02:36:00.000Z	k4r1m	zykotick9	and where does resol.conf come into play? used by /etc/network/interfaces or network-manager or both?
2012-09-23T02:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	k4r1m	i'm not up to speed on the current stuff!  but my impression is that N-M NO LONGER uses resolv.conf in 12.04+
2012-09-23T02:43:00.000Z	zykotick9	k4r1m	lol
