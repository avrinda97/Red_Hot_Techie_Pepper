2009-11-02T04:33:00.000Z	AphisOne		how can I get swap out of read only mode?
2009-11-02T04:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	AphisOne	i never heard of read only swap ...
2009-11-02T04:33:00.000Z	AphisOne	erUSUL	I am trying to refresh my swap partition and I get an error: "swapoff: /dev/sda6: swapoff failed: invalid argument" swap is /dev/sda6 I think sda6 is read-only... but I don't know how to change that... I am in "recover mode"
2009-11-02T04:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	AphisOne	you are sure /dev/sda6 is a swap partition ?
2009-11-02T04:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	AphisOne	sudo fdisk -l
2009-11-02T04:35:00.000Z	AphisOne	erUSUL	yes /dev/sda6 is swap
2009-11-02T04:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	AphisOne	mkswap /dev/sda6 ??
2009-11-02T04:36:00.000Z	AphisOne	erUSUL	that works
2009-11-02T04:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	AphisOne	do swapon now (and swapoff to make sure )
2009-11-02T04:37:00.000Z	AphisOne	erUSUL	it gives me a new UUID
2009-11-02T04:38:00.000Z	AphisOne	erUSUL	that worked
2009-11-02T04:40:00.000Z	AphisOne	erUSUL	when I do `sudo update-initramfs -u` I get the error ln:creatinh hard link `/boot/initrd/img-... Read-only file system
2009-11-02T04:41:00.000Z	AphisOne	erUSUL	sorry it was the /boot partition that is read-only... but the mount shows it as rw
2009-11-02T04:46:00.000Z	AphisOne	erUSUL	I have a Ubuntu 8.10 LiveCD
2009-11-02T04:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	AphisOne	that's the root filesystem. linux mounts filesystem read only when it finds an error in them during boot. boot into a livecd and pass a fsck to the filesystems to see what's going on
2009-11-02T04:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	AphisOne	s/root/boot/ then
2009-11-02T04:42:00.000Z	AphisOne	erUSUL	I'm on my only live CD now on my server...
2009-11-02T04:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	AphisOne	? did not understand ...
2009-11-02T04:45:00.000Z	AphisOne	erUSUL	I need to make another LiveCD
2009-11-02T04:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	AphisOne	ahh ok. any modern linux livecd (the ubuntu desktop version) would do
2009-11-02T04:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	AphisOne	that would do
