2008-01-27T14:58:00.000Z	arnath		i have a movie encoded with the "cook" codec (which i have installed in /usr/lib/win32), totem will not play the audio, vlc will not even play the video for some reason, but Kino can play both
2008-01-27T14:58:00.000Z	arnath		anyone know any reason/solution?
2008-01-27T14:59:00.000Z	travisat	arnath	it is how the programs check for codecs, totem and kine are not using the same subsystem and vlc has its own
2008-01-27T15:00:00.000Z	arnath	travisat	is there a player that uses the same as kine?
2008-01-27T15:00:00.000Z	travisat	arnath	you might try mplayer
2008-01-27T15:01:00.000Z	arnath	travisat	that gives an error "error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device"
2008-01-27T15:03:00.000Z	travisat	arnath	are you sure you installed the codec correctly?
2008-01-27T15:03:00.000Z	arnath	travisat	i installed the w32codecs
2008-01-27T15:03:00.000Z	arnath	travisat	and have been happily playing many different video's
2008-01-27T15:04:00.000Z	arnath	travisat	(mostly with totem)
2008-01-27T15:04:00.000Z	travisat	arnath	ah well I think the problem is its just an obscure codec
2008-01-27T15:05:00.000Z	arnath	travisat	have any idea what i can do? i thought about loading it into kino and reencoding the audio stream (not sure if kino can do that)
2008-01-27T15:05:00.000Z	arnath	travisat	but it's so massive to load an entire movie into kino it seems, after like 10 minutes of loading, it was only at minute 15
2008-01-27T15:05:00.000Z	travisat	arnath	no sorry I don't know enough about your codec
2008-01-27T15:05:00.000Z	arnath	travisat	ok, know of a tool that could recode audio streams of a movie?
2008-01-27T15:06:00.000Z	travisat	arnath	not on linux :(
2008-01-27T15:06:00.000Z	arnath	travisat	aw :<
2008-01-27T15:06:00.000Z	travisat	arnath	there probably is one, but I only know about the windows side of movie encoding
2008-01-27T15:07:00.000Z	arnath	travisat	ah, will see if my good pal google can help me out then :P
2008-01-27T15:07:00.000Z	travisat	arnath	good luck
2008-01-27T15:07:00.000Z	arnath	travisat	thanks :)
