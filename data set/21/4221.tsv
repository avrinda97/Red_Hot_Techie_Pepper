2008-08-25T22:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Nece228	what video card do you have
2008-08-25T22:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Nece228	and interesting experience would be to open the system monitor - start to record and see if the / what resources become busy
2008-08-25T22:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Nece228	I suspect its the video drives
2008-08-25T22:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Nece228	I'd put money on the ati drivers being an issue, straight off the bat
2008-08-25T22:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Nece228	thats normally the weakest link in any system with an ati card in with display issues
2008-08-25T22:18:00.000Z	Nece228	ikonia	the problem isnt with video drivers, ive tried with opensource and proprietary drivers but still same issue
2008-08-25T22:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Nece228	and both are weak
2008-08-25T22:21:00.000Z	Nece228	ikonia	figure it out
2008-08-25T22:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Nece228	I've asked you once about the language, Please stop
2008-08-25T22:23:00.000Z	Nece228	ikonia	how can i fix my issue?
2008-08-25T22:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Nece228	I'm sorry, I'm busy
2008-08-25T22:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Nece228	I have given you some simple pointers to help diagnose the issue
2008-08-25T22:24:00.000Z	Nece228	ikonia	or wait, ive seen in youtube clip when guy with radeon 9600 recorded desktop
2008-08-25T22:24:00.000Z	Nece228	ikonia	so i dont think its driver problem
2008-08-25T22:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Nece228	that means nothing
2008-08-25T22:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Nece228	there are multple hardware vedoras with that chipset, multiple drivers, etc
2008-08-25T22:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Nece228	I suggest you walk through the debugging suggestion I have you
