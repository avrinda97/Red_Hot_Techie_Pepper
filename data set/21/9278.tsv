2006-07-21T15:45:00.000Z	Flannel	johnny_	with what? ftp? samba? what?
2006-08-25T16:11:00.000Z	Flannel	johnny_	try #xubuntu
2006-08-25T16:12:00.000Z	Flannel	johnny_	#xubuntu can help you, it's an xfce specific thing
2006-08-25T16:13:00.000Z	Flannel	johnny_	no, I didn't say that.  Ask in #xubuntu, they are familiar with xfce
2007-10-16T06:09:00.000Z	Flannel	johnny_	You need to remove with --purge (or 'completely remove' in synaptic) to reinstall config files.
2010-08-29T11:31:00.000Z	Flannel	johnny_	All official repositories of 10.04 are now updated to 10.04.1, so you'd have to look to the non-official places for older versions
2010-08-29T11:31:00.000Z	johnny_	Flannel	Alright thanks.
2010-08-29T11:31:00.000Z	Flannel	johnny_	Another thing you might try is the alternate CD (if you're looking to install)
2010-08-29T11:32:00.000Z	Flannel	johnny_	It doesn't use a liveCD.  It boots straight into the installer, and uses an entirely different method for installation (installation via packages instead of copying the liveCD image to the drive)
2010-08-29T11:32:00.000Z	johnny_	Flannel	Thanks for the information. I'll look into that.
2010-08-29T11:33:00.000Z	johnny_	Flannel	Right. My main concern with going back to 10.04 was because of the loopback failing to mount.
