2010-02-28T11:56:00.000Z	mhaedo		see that's the problem
2010-02-28T11:56:00.000Z	mhaedo		when you use the --root-directory flag it assumes that your /boot is within that root directory
2010-02-28T11:56:00.000Z	mhaedo		my /boot is a seperate partition from my root directory
2010-02-28T11:57:00.000Z	mhaedo		so if i do that it installs grub in /boot/grub, which is actually /boot/boot/grub
2010-02-28T11:57:00.000Z	mhaedo		well if i use sda1 as my root directory that is
2010-02-28T11:57:00.000Z	mhaedo		and i'm not sure how i'd even refer to my actual root directory which is a logical volume instead of a normal parttion
2010-02-28T11:58:00.000Z	mhaedo		i miss grub legacy and normal partitions
2010-02-28T12:00:00.000Z	mhaedo		ouch
2010-02-28T12:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mhaedo	What are you trying to do?
2010-02-28T12:02:00.000Z	mhaedo	Jordan_U	ok, here's what i'm trying to do..
2010-02-28T12:02:00.000Z	mhaedo	Jordan_U	i set up a fresh ubuntu 9.10 install on a new box
2010-02-28T12:02:00.000Z	mhaedo	Jordan_U	proceeded to install win7, as i've done many times
2010-02-28T12:02:00.000Z	mhaedo	Jordan_U	i've never had a problem restoring grub before
2010-02-28T12:03:00.000Z	mhaedo	Jordan_U	but this time I'm using grub2 as well as logical volumes
2010-02-28T12:03:00.000Z	mhaedo	Jordan_U	i have /boot as it's own primary partition on /dev/sda1, and the rest of my filesystem as seperate logical volumes in an LVM on /dev/sda2
2010-02-28T12:03:00.000Z	mhaedo	Jordan_U	i cannot figure out how to install grub and make it recognize my /boot partition and root filesystem as a logical volume in an LVM on /dev/sda2
2010-02-28T12:04:00.000Z	mhaedo	Jordan_U	i
2010-02-28T12:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mhaedo	Try this link: http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide
2010-03-03T08:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mhaedo	time <command>
2010-03-03T08:52:00.000Z	mhaedo	Jordan_U	thanks :)
2010-03-03T08:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mhaedo	You're welcome.
