2008-06-01T00:48:00.000Z	s_spiff	nano_	that was the issue until now.. but now that it's detected, and after I've configured the ip add and all.. it still isn't allowing me to connect to my lan
2008-06-01T00:48:00.000Z	nano_	s_spiff	how are you trying to connect to your lan?
2008-06-01T00:49:00.000Z	s_spiff	nano_	basically I just wanna connect to the dc++ hubs and CS servers.. using a realtek ethernet card..i'm using the onboard ethernet card to connect to the net.. given by a different ISP

2008-06-01T00:53:00.000Z	nano_	s_spiff	how is eth1 suppose to get ip address
2008-06-01T00:53:00.000Z	nano_	s_spiff	dynamically?
2008-06-01T00:53:00.000Z	s_spiff	nano_	didn't understand you..
2008-06-01T00:54:00.000Z	s_spiff	nano_	oh noo.. fixed ip..
2008-06-01T00:54:00.000Z	nano_	s_spiff	how are ip addresses assigned to eth1 , dynamially?   if so, did you run dhclient?
2008-06-01T00:57:00.000Z	nano_	s_spiff	i thought you were not able to connect, or is it that you connection routinely times out?
2008-06-01T00:57:00.000Z	s_spiff	nano_	no it doesn't time out ... very rarely.. like once in a bluemoon..
2008-06-01T00:57:00.000Z	nano_	s_spiff	so ur having connection problems?
2008-06-01T00:59:00.000Z	s_spiff	nano_	nopes.. this card is only for my lan..so that i can play CS with my pals and all.. i don't use it for internet...i use the onboard lancard for internet provided by a ISP
2008-06-01T00:59:00.000Z	nano_	s_spiff	so you cannot connect to you CS servers?
2008-06-01T00:59:00.000Z	nano_	s_spiff	and CS server is the only thing that is connected to you eth1?
2008-06-01T00:59:00.000Z	s_spiff	nano_	i can't connect to anyone on my lan.. no dc++ hubs.. no nothing.
2008-06-01T01:02:00.000Z	nano_	s_spiff	i don't know
