2008-06-26T07:53:00.000Z	willy		hey I'm back, I rebooted with the external USB hdd connected and it didn't work
2008-06-26T07:54:00.000Z	willy		this is the only usb hdd i have
2008-06-26T07:54:00.000Z	willy		should I do that?
2008-06-26T07:54:00.000Z	willy		well I don't know what's the sd# number of that disk
2008-06-26T07:54:00.000Z	willy		how can I know that?
2008-06-26T07:55:00.000Z	willy		I have 2 internal IDE HDD
2008-06-26T07:55:00.000Z	willy		and the external usb hdd
2008-06-26T07:56:00.000Z	willy		the dmesg | grep sdb shows info for the internal HDD
2008-06-26T07:57:00.000Z	tc111	willy	"sudo fdisk -l" from a terminal should tell you which drive you need
2008-06-26T08:00:00.000Z	tc111	willy	wols is on the right track then, your machine isn't recognizing its presence...
2008-06-26T08:00:00.000Z	tc111	willy	does the drive work on other machines and if so, what OS
2008-06-26T08:06:00.000Z	tc111	willy	wols: similar to the error i got on my external when the ide to usb controller failed... put the drive in a new case and its fine.
2008-06-26T08:07:00.000Z	tc111	willy	wols: worked intermittently under XP/Vista
2008-06-26T08:17:00.000Z	tc111	willy	unplug your drive, try this from a terminal "sudo modprobe -r ehci_hcd" then plug your drive in again... repost you dmesg output
2008-06-26T08:19:00.000Z	tc111	willy	its a bug... see here - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/211760
2008-06-26T08:20:00.000Z	willy	tc111	will this be permanent, or should i modprobe eveytime I wanna use the HDD?
2008-06-26T08:21:00.000Z	tc111	willy	you could blacklist the module in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist but i don't know how that will affect other drives you may use
2008-06-26T08:24:00.000Z	tc111	willy	are you fully up to date with your 8.04 patches?
2008-06-26T08:24:00.000Z	tc111	willy	have you (gasp!) enabled proposed-updates in your software sources?
2008-06-26T08:25:00.000Z	tc111	willy	or backports
2008-06-26T08:26:00.000Z	tc111	willy	*warning* enabling these will expose you to software that is not fully regression tested (proposed)
