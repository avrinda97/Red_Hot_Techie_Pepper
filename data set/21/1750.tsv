2010-11-01T03:59:00.000Z	edbian	niteshade	! :(  I'm a computer scientist.  I love computers!
2010-11-01T04:00:00.000Z	edbian	niteshade	What is your problem?  Can I help?
2010-11-01T04:04:00.000Z	niteshade	edbian	computer scientist, that's awesome.  I lack the patience specifically when dealing with computers.  I love working with mechanical stuff though.  I'm about to go to school to be a mechanic for cars
2010-11-01T04:04:00.000Z	edbian	niteshade	:)  Awesome
2010-11-01T04:05:00.000Z	edbian	niteshade	Cars have computers in them too :)
2010-11-01T04:28:00.000Z	niteshade	edbian	what's a computer scientist?
2010-11-01T04:28:00.000Z	edbian	niteshade	A person that studies computers :)
2011-03-15T08:06:00.000Z	edbian	niteshade	sudo apt-get source <packageName>
2011-03-15T08:07:00.000Z	edbian	niteshade	apt-get source xchat    (and it will put the source in the current working directory)
2011-03-15T08:09:00.000Z	edbian	niteshade	Sure, but don't try to read the source code if you don't know how to program :)
2011-03-15T08:10:00.000Z	edbian	niteshade	You can download the source and edit it all you want.  It won't make a difference because you have to compile that source to run the code.
2011-03-15T08:11:00.000Z	edbian	niteshade	The linux kernel is just another package.  I don't know which one off the top of my head.
2011-03-15T08:13:00.000Z	edbian	niteshade	It should come with a make file.
2011-03-15T08:14:00.000Z	edbian	niteshade	Then you compile that new version of the code and use it instead of your current version. It's probably a better idea to notify the developers about the bug fix though
2011-03-15T08:15:00.000Z	edbian	niteshade	What if you added it?  Then the developers wouldn't accept your bug fix.  (Nobody would accept your new version without looking at the code)
2011-03-15T08:24:00.000Z	edbian	niteshade	You're off topic
