2005-08-08T09:57:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt		Hello, world.
2005-08-08T09:58:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt		I'm still running warty, which means I only recently got Firefox 1.0.* in a recent security update.
2005-08-08T09:59:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt		The search function is different in Firefox 1.0.  How do I get it to move to a word that it finds?
2005-08-08T09:59:00.000Z	Seveas	EnsignRedshirt	F3
2005-08-08T10:01:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	Seveas	F3 brings up the search field. It seems to be the same as ctrl-F.  But it does not move the page to the word.
2005-08-08T10:01:00.000Z	Seveas	EnsignRedshirt	it should go to the word while you are typing
2005-08-08T10:02:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	Seveas	Hmmm... that is not happening.
2005-08-08T10:10:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	Seveas	(or anyone else):  I looked for settings that might affect the search function under Preferences. The only one that seemed relevant was "Begin finding as you begin typing" under Advanced/Accessibility, but it didn't help.
2005-08-30T13:38:00.000Z	Seveas	EnsignRedshirt	yes
2005-10-19T13:03:00.000Z	Seveas	EnsignRedshirt	depends on the printer
2005-10-19T13:05:00.000Z	Seveas	EnsignRedshirt	system-> admin->printers perhaps...
2005-10-19T13:05:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	Seveas	That's what I'm looking at now, but the printer has not been detected.
2005-10-19T13:06:00.000Z	Seveas	EnsignRedshirt	have you checked linuxprinting.org ?
2005-10-19T13:07:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	Seveas	This printer worked fine in warty.  It is in the list of supported printers.
2005-10-19T13:07:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	Seveas	I think it might be a detection/USB problem.
2005-10-19T13:08:00.000Z	Seveas	EnsignRedshirt	might very well be, consider filing a bug at bugzilla (include the dmesg stuff there and the fact thatit worked in warty)
2005-10-19T13:10:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	Seveas	Hmmm... I got it working by selecting "USB Printer #1".  Go figure.
2005-10-23T05:27:00.000Z	Seveas	EnsignRedshirt	no they don't
2006-02-20T12:36:00.000Z	Seveas	EnsignRedshirt	because of a bug in totem or gstreamer :)
2006-02-20T12:37:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	Seveas	Ah, that could be it.  For the movie I just tried, totem gave me an error window, and ogle crashed, but vlc played it.
2006-03-19T17:00:00.000Z	Seveas	EnsignRedshirt	malone is a component of launchpad
