2012-08-02T23:54:00.000Z	trueneu		Would anyone care to suggest a good module for 'Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N 1030 (rev 34)' wifi card?
2012-08-02T23:54:00.000Z	trueneu		Because the stock one is killing me.
2012-08-02T23:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trueneu	it's in the default install, you just need to disable n speed
2012-08-02T23:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trueneu	do you dual boot?
2012-08-02T23:55:00.000Z	trueneu		Not yet to be honest, MonkeyDust. Didn't know they exist.
2012-08-02T23:56:00.000Z	trueneu	ActionParsnip	something like iwconfig wlan0 modu <> , you mean?
2012-08-02T23:56:00.000Z	trueneu		Thanks a lot, MonkeyDust.
2012-08-02T23:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trueneu	do you dual boot?
2012-08-03T00:00:00.000Z	trueneu	ActionParsnip	yup I do.
2012-08-03T00:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trueneu	then in Windows disable the devices ability to wake up the OS as well as disable power management
2012-08-03T00:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trueneu	trueneu those chips also have a hard time with n speed wifi, so you may need to disable that if the link keeps dropping off
2012-08-03T00:01:00.000Z	trueneu		Erm, my second OS is not Windows. I think I can disable those from BIOS.
2012-08-03T00:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trueneu	there is no 'second OS', you just dual boot
2012-08-03T00:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trueneu	boot to windows and you can do it in device manager
2012-08-03T00:02:00.000Z	trueneu		Let's say I don't boot into Windows. I have no Windows installed.
2012-08-03T00:02:00.000Z	trueneu		So I can't boot into it as it's not my second OS. =)
2012-08-03T00:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trueneu	then try running: echo "options iwlagn 11n_disable50=1 11n_disable=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/iwlagn.conf > /dev/null
2012-08-03T00:03:00.000Z	trueneu		I'll try to disable n modulation then, thanks.
2012-08-03T00:03:00.000Z	trueneu		Uh-huh, thanks a lot.
2012-08-03T00:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trueneu	you may also need to run:  echo "iwlagn" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules > /dev/null
2012-08-03T00:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trueneu	makes the driver load
