2009-07-17T20:24:00.000Z	limpc		dulak - not at all.
2009-07-17T20:25:00.000Z	Halitech	limpc	if you want root then maybe you should look into running Debian or Redhat that allows it
2009-07-17T20:25:00.000Z	limpc	Halitech	yeah i run redhat, slackware, bsd, and have a LFS box :)
2009-07-17T20:26:00.000Z	limpc	Halitech	I like Ubuntu because it works well with modern hardware without too much fuss, and I dont like Fedora.
2009-07-17T20:27:00.000Z	Halitech	limpc	I like Debian but I installed sudo on it because I find it easier to deal with then logging in as root for a single command but to each their own
2009-07-17T20:29:00.000Z	limpc	Halitech	yeah :) I've got nothing against sudo.  I would prefer regular users to use sudo on boxes.  Just dont think it should be treated as taboo and instilled into newbsa as "avoid unless no other choice" mentality.  it makes for a very "green" generation of linux people.
2009-07-17T20:44:00.000Z	limpc	Halitech	i downgraded from 64-bit yesterday
2009-07-17T20:44:00.000Z	Halitech	limpc	why?
2009-07-17T20:44:00.000Z	limpc	Halitech	had issues with AIR apps. apparently Adobe offically only supports 32 bit
2009-07-17T20:44:00.000Z	Halitech	limpc	ahh, don't use them myself
2009-07-17T20:44:00.000Z	limpc	Halitech	you can get it working kinda by installing ia32 libs
2009-07-17T20:45:00.000Z	limpc	Halitech	however its very buggy and stuff "vanishes" from them.  I also had issues with a sluggish UI (im running an AMDx64, maybe its processor specific)
2009-07-17T20:46:00.000Z	Halitech	limpc	I have the ia32 libs installed (don't remember why now) and I have a AMD 5200+ with no issues
2009-07-17T20:46:00.000Z	limpc	Halitech	no idea then :) didnt have alot of time to troubleshoot so just plugged in my netinstall USB thumb and rebooted hehe
2009-07-17T20:47:00.000Z	Halitech	limpc	I also use debian lenny with XFCE, I find too much bloat in most of the newer releases of Ubuntu
2009-07-17T20:47:00.000Z	limpc	Halitech	yep, xfce rocks. faster than gnome too.
2009-07-17T20:48:00.000Z	Halitech	limpc	only thing I don't like is the lack of networking support like nautilus has
2009-07-17T20:48:00.000Z	limpc	Halitech	admittedly, i was using gnome at the time.  however im directly comparing gnome on 32 and 64 bit kernels. just ran very slow on 64 compared to 32.  was a fresh install and i wasnt using compiz so was definitely something somewhere in the default install
2009-07-17T20:49:00.000Z	Halitech	limpc	something running extra causing issues for you
2009-07-17T20:49:00.000Z	limpc	Halitech	xfce includes gnome apps. you can run nautilus
2009-07-17T20:50:00.000Z	Halitech	limpc	I know I can run gnome (or kde) apps but I don't want to add a bunch of gnome dependencies and 90percent of the time I don't have any computers to connect to so I just use thumb drives to transfer files
