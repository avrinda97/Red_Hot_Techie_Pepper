2005-03-11T16:55:00.000Z	Odin2347		lol
2005-03-11T16:55:00.000Z	scoon	Odin2347	what kind of cards do you have.
2005-03-11T16:55:00.000Z	scoon	Odin2347	the recog'd of them is thru the linux kernel
2005-03-11T16:58:00.000Z	Odin2347	scoon	i have a sounblaster live 24bit and a dlink g520 atheros chipset
2005-03-11T16:58:00.000Z	scoon	Odin2347	well they are both pretty standard.
2005-03-11T16:59:00.000Z	Odin2347		hmm
2005-03-11T16:59:00.000Z	scoon	Odin2347	I bet knoppix would have noticed them as well. and you'd be able to just install from the live cd.
2005-03-11T16:59:00.000Z	Odin2347	scoon	kanotix picks up the soundcard but not the wireless
2005-03-11T17:00:00.000Z	scoon	Odin2347	but I am a huge GNOME fan.  I don't like kde and that is why i use ubuntu
2005-03-12T17:00:00.000Z	Odin2347		i didnt try knoppix
2005-03-12T17:00:00.000Z	Odin2347		check what?
2005-03-12T17:00:00.000Z	scoon	Odin2347	well with a little bit of google, you could get that wireless card working.
