2005-07-20T10:55:00.000Z	NerdGirl		well, I'm back, still having issues with my display.
2005-07-20T10:56:00.000Z	NerdGirl		ddcprobe replied with the exact same sync settings I've been using, and dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg enabled X again, but I'm still stuck at 640x480
2005-07-20T10:57:00.000Z	crimsun	NerdGirl	please paste /var/log/Xorg.0.log onto the topic's pastebin if you haven't already. If you have pasted it, please pass me the url.
2005-07-20T11:09:00.000Z	crimsun	NerdGirl	sorry 'bout the lag; did you paste the log onto paste.ubuntulinux.nl?
2005-07-20T11:16:00.000Z	NerdGirl	crimsun	working on it.  Don't know how to do this except a page at a time.
2005-07-20T11:18:00.000Z	crimsun	NerdGirl	ok
2005-07-20T11:33:00.000Z	NerdGirl	crimsun	Finally...  http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/574
2005-07-20T11:34:00.000Z	NerdGirl	crimsun	I have a Samsung SyncMaster 175v LCD monitor, capable of 1280x1024 native.  Intel i845GL chipset.
2005-07-20T11:35:00.000Z	NerdGirl	crimsun	HorizRefresh: 30-81 kHz, VertSync: 56-75 Hz, both by ddcprobe and manufacturer specs.
2005-07-20T11:36:00.000Z	crimsun	NerdGirl	that seems awfully low
2005-07-20T11:39:00.000Z	crimsun	NerdGirl	yep
2005-07-20T11:39:00.000Z	NerdGirl	crimsun	can't help it, that's what I"ve got.
2005-07-20T11:40:00.000Z	NerdGirl	crimsun	remember, it's an LCD.
2005-07-20T11:44:00.000Z	crimsun	NerdGirl	have you tried hard-coding a modeline?
2005-07-20T11:44:00.000Z	crimsun	NerdGirl	for instance, do you want to use 1280x1024 @ 75 Hz?
2005-07-20T11:44:00.000Z	NerdGirl	crimsun	yeah.  How do I hardcode that?
2005-07-20T11:45:00.000Z	crimsun	NerdGirl	place the following line in your Screen section: Modeline "1280x1024_75.00"  138.54  1280 1368 1504 1728  1024 1025 1028 1069  -HSync +Vsync
2005-07-20T11:46:00.000Z	crimsun	NerdGirl	sorry, section Monitor
2005-07-20T11:51:00.000Z	crimsun	NerdGirl	have you placed that modeline into the Monitor section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2005-07-20T11:59:00.000Z	crimsun	NerdGirl	which editor are you comfortable with?
2005-07-20T12:00:00.000Z	crimsun	NerdGirl	hmm, how about nano instead?
