2009-01-19T01:41:00.000Z	vyom_at_prg	jim_p	Its intel g41 chipset on a gigabyte motherboard intel c2d processor
2009-01-19T01:41:00.000Z	vyom_at_prg	jim_p	its ok jim,thanks anyways
2009-01-19T02:00:00.000Z	jim_p	vyom_at_prg	cant you make it like mine?
2009-01-19T01:46:00.000Z	jim_p	vyom_at_prg	me! is there a reason installation fails?
2009-01-19T01:46:00.000Z	vyom_at_prg	jim_p	The installation is fine
2009-01-19T01:47:00.000Z	vyom_at_prg	jim_p	but after that when I choose intel as the driver in xorg.conf..it says (EE) No devices found
2009-01-19T01:49:00.000Z	jim_p	vyom_at_prg	give me some time to think
2009-01-19T01:51:00.000Z	vyom_at_prg	jim_p	ok sure
2009-01-19T01:52:00.000Z	vyom_at_prg	jim_p	default driver with ubuntu allows me 1280X1024 so,,i am ok with untill you/me or someoine else finds a solution
2009-01-19T01:53:00.000Z	jim_p	vyom_at_prg	cant you just... pin the resolution in xorg.conf??
2009-01-19T01:54:00.000Z	vyom_at_prg	jim_p	I have tried that jim
2009-01-19T01:55:00.000Z	vyom_at_prg	jim_p	Also the xorg file in ubuntu 8.10 is quite short and abstract
2009-01-19T01:55:00.000Z	vyom_at_prg	jim_p	I think some values are dynamically chosen
2009-01-19T01:56:00.000Z	jim_p	vyom_at_prg	make it big and precise. the values are not dynamically chosen if they are not there. they are RANDOMLY chosen
2009-01-19T01:57:00.000Z	jim_p	vyom_at_prg	here is my xorg.conf. really exagerated on the fglrx options, but you will get an idea                   http://7g.pri.ee/mine.conf
2009-01-19T01:59:00.000Z	vyom_at_prg	jim_p	check here, my xorg file has a totla of 10 lines..http://rafb.net/p/Uh5HqV39.html
2009-01-19T02:00:00.000Z	vyom_at_prg	jim_p	I can try
