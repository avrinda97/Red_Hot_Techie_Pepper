2010-05-02T19:43:00.000Z	aj00200		Hello. Every time I plug in my Garmin Nuvi GPS into my Ubuntu 10.04 computer, it will crash, show a black screen with a frozen mouse, and the Capslock and Scroll Lock keyboard lights will blink. Anyone know what might be causing this?
2010-05-02T19:43:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	aj00200	does the nuvi have a differential serial interface or just USB?
2010-05-02T19:44:00.000Z	aj00200	tonsofpcs	only usb
2010-05-02T19:44:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	aj00200	can you check your dmesg logs?
2010-05-02T19:44:00.000Z	aj00200	tonsofpcs	how would I do this?
2010-05-02T19:45:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	aj00200	in /var/log, find the dmesg log that has a created date closest to before your machine crashed (probably just dmesg, could be dmesg.1.gz)
2010-05-02T19:47:00.000Z	aj00200	tonsofpcs	ok, I have it. Now what?
2010-05-02T19:50:00.000Z	aj00200	tonsofpcs	ok, I have the log. Now what?
2010-05-02T19:55:00.000Z	aj00200	tonsofpcs	?
2010-05-02T20:03:00.000Z	aj00200	tonsofpcs	are you back?
2010-05-02T20:12:00.000Z	aj00200	tonsofpcs	 you on?
2010-05-02T20:12:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	aj00200	kinda
2010-05-02T20:13:00.000Z	aj00200	tonsofpcs	ok, please don't stay just because of me. What do I do with the logs now?
2010-05-02T20:13:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	aj00200	look at them
2010-05-02T20:14:00.000Z	aj00200	tonsofpcs	Ok, I'll try to find that
2010-05-02T20:18:00.000Z	aj00200	tonsofpcs	the time stamp never resets back to 0. Once it starts going up, it keeps going up. What would the assigning line look like?
2010-05-02T20:20:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	aj00200	it'll be before it started going up
2010-05-02T20:24:00.000Z	aj00200	tonsofpcs	should I pastebin the files? I can't seem to find anything. You would probably be much better at this
2010-05-02T20:25:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	aj00200	i'm about to go out the door
2010-05-02T20:25:00.000Z	aj00200	tonsofpcs	ok. Well, thanks anyways :D
2010-05-02T20:25:00.000Z	aj00200	tonsofpcs	ok. I will
