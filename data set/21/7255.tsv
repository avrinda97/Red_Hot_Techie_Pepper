2007-01-23T17:39:00.000Z	faLUCE		Hi. A really difficoult question. If I launch xset in order to blank the screen while mplayer is running, and another script kills mplayer, xset returns to the desktop. I don't want that this happens (I want that the blank screen remains)... what should I do?

2007-01-23T17:41:00.000Z	ikonia	faLUCE	we saw you 1 minute ago
2007-01-23T17:42:00.000Z	faLUCE	ikonia	with two separate scripts
2007-02-02T15:06:00.000Z	ikonia	faLUCE	don't patch the kernel source as it won't match the pre-compiled binary
2007-02-02T15:07:00.000Z	faLUCE	ikonia	?
2007-02-02T16:00:00.000Z	ikonia	faLUCE	I told you this before
2007-02-02T16:04:00.000Z	faLUCE	ikonia	ok, i've also found the deb package of linuxtv-dvb in /pub/ubuntu/archive/pool/universe/l/linuxtv-dvb . Now: how can i install the packages with adept? I don't find them in the source list
2011-12-02T12:48:00.000Z	ikonia	faLUCE	we don't support your custom spins
2011-12-02T12:48:00.000Z	faLUCE	ikonia	what a stupid answer
2011-12-02T12:48:00.000Z	ikonia	faLUCE	no, it's the factual answer, you are making your own ubuntu spin, we only support the official builds in this channel
2011-12-02T12:48:00.000Z	faLUCE	ikonia	in addition, talk for yourself
2011-12-02T12:48:00.000Z	faLUCE	ikonia	stupid answer
2011-12-02T12:48:00.000Z	ikonia	faLUCE	please drop the attitude, I'm just making you aware that your custom spin is something we don't support
2011-12-02T12:49:00.000Z	faLUCE	ikonia	ok, I'll simply ignore you
2012-03-06T18:09:00.000Z	ikonia	faLUCE	music production general has poor products on linux from experience
2012-03-06T18:10:00.000Z	faLUCE	ikonia	this is not an useful answer
2012-03-06T18:10:00.000Z	ikonia	faLUCE	it is the truth though
2012-03-06T18:10:00.000Z	ikonia	faLUCE	if you are sure there is something good, why are you asking
2012-03-06T18:10:00.000Z	ikonia	faLUCE	if you are sure it exists, go and find it
2012-03-06T18:11:00.000Z	ikonia	faLUCE	also, please don't cross post the same question in multiple ubuntu channels, it's cross-posting spam and not useful
