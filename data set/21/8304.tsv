2008-10-16T21:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	XiXaQ	what are you trying?
2008-10-16T21:46:00.000Z	XiXaQ	erUSUL	GEdit has a Python Console plugin that lets you have an interactive python interpreter in the bottom panel. However, I can't import my own modules there.
2008-10-16T21:46:00.000Z	XiXaQ	erUSUL	so I need to set PYTHONPATH so Gedit will read it and give it to the python interpreter.
2008-10-16T21:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	XiXaQ	the file is ~/.gnomerc http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=60053
