2006-07-25T11:53:00.000Z	ndkk3		hey, i have a file called "~" in my / dir, will this delete all my files if i "sudo rm -rf ~" ?
2006-07-25T11:53:00.000Z	ndkk3		why
2006-07-25T11:53:00.000Z	ndkk3		i did it, but nothin happened
2006-07-25T11:53:00.000Z	ndkk3		i did: sudo rm -rf ~
2006-07-25T11:54:00.000Z	foobear	ndkk3	 I think you should try it and tell us all what happens..., assuming you can still run you're IRC client...
2006-07-25T12:14:00.000Z	foobear	ndkk3	who gives a sh as long as you archived the "meticulously indexed pr0n collection" somewhere outside of /~
2006-07-25T12:24:00.000Z	foobear	ndkk3	if you know debian, apt is the way to go.
2006-07-25T12:26:00.000Z	foobear	ndkk3	if its a local install, I'd just recreate home directories.
2006-07-25T12:28:00.000Z	foobear	ndkk3	well assuming you deleted and want to recreate user directories as, just create them and copy default profile and bashrc into them.
2006-07-25T12:49:00.000Z	ndkk3	foobear	ok, i created a new user, should i copy all files in /home/ndkk3 as 'cp *' to the new user (/home/dgethot) ?
2006-07-25T12:51:00.000Z	foobear	ndkk3	depends whether you want the user dgethot (whats that all about) to have the exact profile as ndkk3 or not.  FWIW, you REALLY want the .files, like .bashrc and .bash_profile...
2006-07-25T12:51:00.000Z	ndkk3	foobear	why would i copy all them files if that 'profile' is fucked up?
2006-07-25T12:55:00.000Z	foobear	ndkk3	if you want ndkk3 to have a clean start, `cp /etc/profile /home/ndkk3/.profile ; cp /etc/bash.bashrc /home/.bashrc` and be done with it...
2006-07-25T12:56:00.000Z	ndkk3	foobear	that's it?
2006-07-25T12:59:00.000Z	foobear	ndkk3	that is the bear neccessities.  should get you started.  Most applications, including X, will recreate their own config files when you first run them.  And assuming you're running a display manager under init you should be all set...
2006-07-25T13:01:00.000Z	ndkk3	foobear	i don't get what you're saying, init, etc, im kinda new
2006-07-25T13:04:00.000Z	foobear	ndkk3	 if you type this command... `less /etc/inittab`, you will be looking at THE most important initialization config file in unix (well System V based unixes anyway - like Debian).  That will tell you what order things get started by the Unix initialization process.
2006-07-25T13:05:00.000Z	ndkk3	foobear	i just typed what you have said
2006-07-25T13:05:00.000Z	foobear	ndkk3	If you want to learn more about this process, read the MAN page on inittab.
2006-07-25T13:07:00.000Z	foobear	ndkk3	inittab tell the kernel what initialization level to boot up into (i.e., single user, multi-user, network/no network, etc.) Think of it like Windoze "Safe Mode", "Safe Mode w/ networking", "Normal", etc.)
2006-07-25T13:12:00.000Z	foobear	ndkk3	do what ic56 said then, but you'd probably be ok.
