2011-03-23T15:17:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	lucid_j	sudo apt-get install compiz-fusion-plugins-extra compizconfig-settings-manager
2011-03-23T15:18:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	lucid_j	that'll help you.  then alt + F2 and type ccsm
2011-03-23T15:19:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	lucid_j	then go ahead and use that command.  your going to need ccsm to atleast configure compiz's settings
2011-03-23T15:20:00.000Z	lucid_j	Us3r_Unfriendly	Could I do that without configure?
2011-03-23T15:20:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	lucid_j	ccsm stands for compizconfig-settings-manager
2011-03-23T15:21:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	lucid_j	I don't believe so
2011-03-23T15:21:00.000Z	lucid_j	Us3r_Unfriendly	I know what it is

2011-03-23T15:27:00.000Z	lucid_j	Us3r_Unfriendly	That's also not transparent!
2011-03-23T15:28:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	lucid_j	I believe your wrong sir
2011-03-23T15:28:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	lucid_j	look closer
2011-03-23T15:29:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	lucid_j	your talking about the panel??  I thought you were talking about the windows that were open
2011-03-23T15:29:00.000Z	lucid_j	Us3r_Unfriendly	I am talking about a complete trasparent theme
2011-03-23T15:31:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	lucid_j	right click the panel "taskbar?" and go to the Properties then to the background tab and then click solid color and there's a switch for transparency there.  then to ccsm for everything else
2011-03-23T15:32:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	lucid_j	metacity --replace
2011-03-23T15:32:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	lucid_j	if your going to troll i can't help you.  you live and learn in the linux community.  if your afraid, then you shouldn't do it.
2011-03-23T15:34:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	lucid_j	emerald, ccsm, panel properties or some docks properties
2011-03-23T15:40:00.000Z	lucid_j	Us3r_Unfriendly	I installed ccsm, is it simple to set transparency on?
