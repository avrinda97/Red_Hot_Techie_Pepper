2009-05-24T04:31:00.000Z	finiteset		ubuntu upgraded itself and now when I try to install skype it says wrong architecture!!! it was working fine before the upgrade... whats wrong?
2009-05-24T04:32:00.000Z	boss_mc	finiteset	have you changed your medibuntu source to be jaunty, not intrepid?
2009-05-24T04:33:00.000Z	finiteset	boss_mc	I did not change anything manually... there was a message taht do u want to upgrade to 9.04? and I said yes..It did everything automatically and when I restarted skype was gone...
2009-05-24T04:34:00.000Z	boss_mc	finiteset	It's because it's not in the standard ubuntu repositories, you have to add the medibuntu ones that correspond to jaunty
2009-05-24T04:35:00.000Z	finiteset	boss_mc	how do I do that?
2009-05-24T04:36:00.000Z	boss_mc	finiteset	follow the link ubotto gave you, and go to 'Adding the Repositories'
2009-05-24T04:36:00.000Z	finiteset	boss_mc	and then?
2009-05-24T04:36:00.000Z	boss_mc	finiteset	follow the instructions on screen (use the ones for jaunty...)
2009-05-24T04:41:00.000Z	finiteset	boss_mc	I followed the instructions..but I still get the error "wrong architecture" from skype.deb
2009-05-24T04:41:00.000Z	boss_mc	finiteset	did you download the .deb from skype's site?
2009-05-24T04:41:00.000Z	finiteset	boss_mc	yes
2009-05-24T04:42:00.000Z	finiteset	boss_mc	I have a 64bit kernel
2009-05-24T04:42:00.000Z	boss_mc	finiteset	ok, I think you downloaded the 64bit one rather than the 32bit one (or vice versa)
2009-05-24T04:42:00.000Z	boss_mc	finiteset	but you can now just install it through synaptic/apt-get/aptitude
2009-05-24T04:42:00.000Z	finiteset	boss_mc	the problem is that there is only one version
2009-05-24T04:42:00.000Z	boss_mc	finiteset	and have it autoupdate (which is nice)
2009-05-24T04:43:00.000Z	finiteset	boss_mc	let me try that
2009-05-24T04:43:00.000Z	boss_mc	finiteset	good point, I think they fail....
2009-05-24T04:45:00.000Z	finiteset	boss_mc	it actually worked... thanks for the help
2009-05-24T04:45:00.000Z	boss_mc	finiteset	good, no
2009-05-24T04:46:00.000Z	boss_mc	finiteset	...problem
