2007-07-06T12:54:00.000Z	epsy		hello
2007-07-06T12:55:00.000Z	epsy		My friend got a problem installing ubuntu
2007-07-06T12:55:00.000Z	epsy		it seems his kernel didn't got installed
2007-07-06T12:55:00.000Z	epsy		 on boot it says error 15 file not found 
2007-07-06T12:55:00.000Z	epsy		then he get the menu
2007-07-06T12:55:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	epsy	you too should read obutu thats a GRUB problem
2007-07-06T12:57:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	epsy	What is that supposed to mean ~_~"
2007-07-06T12:57:00.000Z	epsy	Pirate_Hunter	he just installed ubuntu, he didn't installed wingblows or whatever
2007-07-06T12:58:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	epsy	he only installed ubuntu and already received error 15, if thats the case and he is nto dual booting than clean install make sure the CD is not faulty
2007-07-06T13:00:00.000Z	epsy	Pirate_Hunter	btw, boot is on another partition than /
2007-07-06T13:00:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	epsy	listen he is installing to an empty HD, he has no data that he will lose, ubuntu didnt install properly meaning either the CD is faulty or the chosen options are wrong, do a clean install that is better than me going through different methods of correcting GRUB when he is not dual booting
2007-07-06T13:01:00.000Z	epsy	Pirate_Hunter	he had wingblows on it but wished to remove it
2007-07-06T13:02:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	epsy	I dont get you he deleted windows and instaled ubuntu, he didnt tell ubuntu to format the disk or he did format it but the MRB was still there pointing at the old partition in that case ubunto insatlled GRUB, but if he has nothing to lose just do another clean install it takes less than 30min
2007-07-06T13:03:00.000Z	epsy	Pirate_Hunter	he did :/
2007-07-06T13:05:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	epsy	ok so youre telling me while i told you to do a new install he has already done it, so he has tried to install it again, best bet the cd, is faulty otherwise you should format the HD not with the ubuntu cd but a boot disk using command fdisk and than install ubuntu again if your certain that the disk is working properly and there no problems with it
2007-07-06T13:11:00.000Z	epsy	Pirate_Hunter	freeDOS :p
2007-07-06T13:12:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	epsy	thanx will look into that but i still dont understand why wine wouldnt be able to emulate it
2007-07-06T13:12:00.000Z	epsy	Pirate_Hunter	open winecfg
2007-07-06T13:13:00.000Z	epsy	Pirate_Hunter	his cd is fine
2007-07-06T13:15:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	epsy	than when he formated the hd thorugh the CD, im assuming it didnt do it properly instead filesystem stil picks up the previous installed OS which means a nice clean full format will erase everything, can you get your hand on win 98 bootdisk it does the job
2007-07-06T13:16:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	epsy	there is no point trying to fix Grub if there is no other OS to boot from just clean the hd completely
