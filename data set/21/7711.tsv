2006-11-30T17:55:00.000Z	burwaco		if edgy is not suited for older machines, why is there a xubuntu edgy release ?

2006-11-30T06:12:00.000Z	burwaco		I'm getting the xubuntu alternate cd now formy armada 7800, 7 minutes left...
2006-11-30T06:14:00.000Z	stefg	burwaco	i have an Armada700 running xubuntu... nice lil' box.. the first linux install ever i did, where i didn't have to touch a single config after the default install. Everything just worked out of the box
2006-11-30T16:56:00.000Z	stefg	burwaco	you want a server-install and then a carefully handselected choice of packages... no wizard, no *-desktop-package... just plain know-how and manual installation
2006-11-30T16:57:00.000Z	burwaco	stefg	I don't want a server, I have an old laptop here PII 300Mhz, I just want a nice slip x environment and firefox, but not fluxbox...
2006-11-30T16:59:00.000Z	stefg	burwaco	"server"-install is the minimal install... then you can e.g. apt-get xserver-xorg and all the X-stuff you want
2006-12-01T17:01:00.000Z	burwaco	stefg	I don't have a server now, I just have a base system, I'd like a desktop manager and a thing like fluxbox but better...
2006-12-01T17:03:00.000Z	stefg	burwaco	'server' in ubuntu-speak == 'base system'... the next thing up to the foodchain over fluxbx  would be xfce then, indeed. but you have to manually select all the xfce packages, xubuntu-desktop will install alot of other cruft
2006-12-01T17:04:00.000Z	burwaco	stefg	apt-get install xubuntu-desktop doesn't install x-window-system ???
2006-12-01T17:05:00.000Z	stefg	burwaco	it will install an X-Server AND abiword AND gnumeric AND....
2006-12-01T17:10:00.000Z	burwaco	stefg	so I: apt-get install x-window-system xfce4 ?
2006-12-01T17:13:00.000Z	stefg	burwaco	as i said there's no simple installation of one or two packages... you've got to manually go through the package list in aptitude and select your wanted packages. all those meta-packages probably install stuff that you don't want
2006-12-01T17:14:00.000Z	burwaco	stefg	isn't there a package like the gnome-base-system
2006-12-01T17:46:00.000Z	burwaco	stefg	I selected a few libs and x-server xdm and stuff that sounded necessary, apt is doing a bunch off stuff now, looks like it's going to be ok
2006-12-01T17:52:00.000Z	burwaco	stefg	It worked, Xfce without all the crap, just 5 or 6 packages...
2007-11-02T02:36:00.000Z	stefg	burwaco	that'll end up with a broken box in the majority of cases
2007-11-02T02:36:00.000Z	burwaco	stefg	yes, not the upgrade in the middle...
