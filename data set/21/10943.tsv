2009-07-06T05:08:00.000Z	KillGorack		why would X Screen 0, show up as CRT-1, and X Screen 1 show up as DFP-0 within the GPU tree towards the bottom of the list.. are they mixed up somehow??
2009-07-06T05:08:00.000Z	KillGorack		yea scunizi I get that part.. I can go back to twqin view easily..
2009-07-06T05:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 ive rarely seen a need for seperate X sessions. I alwayys use twinview.
2009-07-06T05:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 the only programs ive seen that take over 'both' are badly written ones..  and some java apps.
2009-07-06T05:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 i play a great many games.. and they fullscreen on only one monitor.
2009-07-06T05:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 you could also use the xrandr stuff to temparly disable the 2nd monitor.
2009-07-06T05:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 what game are you refering to?
2009-07-06T05:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 intalling trem. now.. that game always makes me dizzy and pukey tho. :)
2009-07-06T05:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 twinview is 'xinerma+extrafeatures' - Just using 'xinerma' can cause issues.. its the twinview extensions that enable  the smarter 'features'
2009-07-06T05:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 tremulus seems really really brain dead. :) it did 'full screen'' to the wrong screen.. and was off position by 1/2 the screen
2009-07-06T05:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 i edited the config file and told it to not go 'fullscreen' and gave it a proper res for the window. it is at least now appearing in a window and is playable. :)
2009-07-06T05:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 it even defaulted to  the wrong res for the monitor it was appearing on..
2009-07-06T05:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 or try the xrandr trick to disale the 2nd monitor.. run game.. exit game.. reneable 2nd monitor.
2009-07-06T05:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 so you broke it! shame! :)
2009-07-06T05:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 the aliens are eating your brainz

2009-07-06T06:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 found a few neat games via Djl thats not in the repos. :)
2009-07-06T06:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 been playing Numpty Physics lately..  and a few others.   The app has screenshot/descriptions of various games..
2009-07-06T06:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KillGorack	 yea.. its nifty. :) makes installing some games a lot easier. (the non gpl ones)
