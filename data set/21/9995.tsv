2005-12-17T07:48:00.000Z	liquidboy		is anyone else having trouble with synaptic? "W: Couldn't stat source package list http://archive.ubuntu.com breezy/universe Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_breezy_universe_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)"
2005-12-17T07:49:00.000Z	liquidboy		tried it, i get this error "Could not download all repository indexes"
2005-12-17T07:49:00.000Z	liquidboy		the same thing
2005-12-17T07:49:00.000Z	liquidboy		http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/breezy/universe/binary-i386/Packages.gz: Sub-process gzip returned an error code (1)
2005-12-17T07:50:00.000Z	liquidboy		seveas, i forgot where the list is...
2005-12-17T07:50:00.000Z	dooglus	liquidboy	try "sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/*" then "sudo apt-get update" again
2005-12-17T08:05:00.000Z	liquidboy	dooglus	do you want to give me the commands again, incase you misspelt them?
2005-12-17T08:03:00.000Z	dooglus	liquidboy	did you try what I suggested?
2005-12-17T08:04:00.000Z	liquidboy	dooglus	after i entered the first command, it came up with another prompt (just the arrow)
2005-12-17T08:04:00.000Z	dooglus	liquidboy	that means you've got unbalanced quotes, or brackets, or some such
2005-12-17T08:04:00.000Z	dooglus	liquidboy	or that I did...
2005-12-17T08:04:00.000Z	liquidboy	dooglus	unbalanced quotes?
2005-12-17T08:06:00.000Z	dooglus	liquidboy	I put double quotes around the 2 commands.  you shouldn't.
2005-12-17T08:07:00.000Z	liquidboy	dooglus	rm: cannot remove `/var/lib/apt/lists/partial': Is a directory
2005-12-17T08:07:00.000Z	dooglus	liquidboy	I meant for you to copy the * but not the "
2005-12-17T08:07:00.000Z	liquidboy	dooglus	i did that
2005-12-17T08:08:00.000Z	dooglus	liquidboy	oh, that's ok then.  that error's to be expected.
2005-12-17T08:08:00.000Z	liquidboy	dooglus	do i go ahead with the next one? or will it not work?
2005-12-17T08:08:00.000Z	dooglus	liquidboy	yeah, go ahead :)
2005-12-17T08:21:00.000Z	liquidboy	dooglus	i think it worked, btw, when i typed apt-get update, did i enable the multiverse repositores?
2005-12-17T08:22:00.000Z	dooglus	liquidboy	no.  the stuff I told you to do didn't change anything other than fix the broken cache
