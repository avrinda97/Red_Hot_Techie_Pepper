2005-05-28T13:53:00.000Z	rapha		How do you burn bin/cue files under Ubuntu?
2005-05-28T13:55:00.000Z	nalioth	rapha	you can use binchunker to convert bin/cue to iso image
2005-08-31T15:17:00.000Z	nalioth	rapha	search the wiki.ubuntu.com for "pinning"
2005-08-31T15:29:00.000Z	rapha	nalioth	that helped
2006-01-25T09:44:00.000Z	nalioth	rapha	that is a known problem. there is nothing you can do easily
2006-01-25T09:45:00.000Z	rapha	nalioth	so I will have to remove the button that detects the lid close?
2006-01-25T09:45:00.000Z	nalioth	rapha	i wouldnt mess with anything.
2006-01-25T09:47:00.000Z	rapha	nalioth	Well, as it stands now, this severely limits the usability of my iBook. And I need to fix the mousepad anyway, which will require opening of the case...
2006-01-25T09:48:00.000Z	nalioth	rapha	it is your equipment, i suspect it'd be easier to recompile the kernel to fix both problems
2006-01-25T09:50:00.000Z	rapha	nalioth	OOOH! From your previous statement, I didn't think it was quite as easy as recompiling the kernel. Is there some documentation anywhere on what options need to be changed?
2006-01-25T09:51:00.000Z	rapha	nalioth	the mousepad however is physically broken, so recompiling the kernel won't fix that :-)
2006-01-25T09:51:00.000Z	nalioth	rapha	i dont consider recompling the kernel 'easy' and i know both problems can be fixed with a kernal recompile (with the right stuff) but i am not familiar with how to do it
2006-01-25T09:51:00.000Z	nalioth	rapha	ah, no it won't
2006-01-25T09:51:00.000Z	rapha	nalioth	I'm coming from LFS, there was no way for you to know that, sorry :-)
2006-01-25T09:52:00.000Z	rapha	nalioth	the mousepad has the only software-problem that I can't "tap" on it... if that could be fixed would also be cool
2006-01-25T09:53:00.000Z	rapha	nalioth	I already tried finding some docs on something like needed kernel changes but couldn't find anything, so if you had ANY pointer whatsoever I'd be most grateful :)
2006-01-25T09:53:00.000Z	nalioth	rapha	the yellowdog kernel seems to run ibooks and powerbooks just fine (all features work)
2006-01-25T09:54:00.000Z	rapha	nalioth	Okay then, maybe somebody in the YellowDog channel knows something about patches required...
2006-01-25T09:55:00.000Z	nalioth	rapha	that is the path i'd follow
2006-01-25T09:55:00.000Z	rapha	nalioth	thanks for bringing me so far tho :-)
