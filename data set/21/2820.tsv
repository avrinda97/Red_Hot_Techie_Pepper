2009-06-08T10:32:00.000Z	daVID09		I NEED TO SET UP THE 5IN1 CARD READER
2009-06-08T10:32:00.000Z	daVID09		sorry
2009-06-08T10:32:00.000Z	daVID09		i didn't know it was on
2009-06-08T10:32:00.000Z	daVID09		anyone know how to set up the 5in1 card reader?
2009-06-08T10:33:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	daVID09	Is it USB?
2009-06-08T10:33:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	daVID09	You should be able to just plug it in, and it'll work
2009-06-08T10:33:00.000Z	daVID09	rpgsimmaster	no, its built in in my laptop
2009-06-08T10:33:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	daVID09	Then it should automatically work
2009-06-08T10:33:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	daVID09	However, it won't show up as different drives, until a card is actually put into the drive
2009-06-08T10:34:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	daVID09	Generally speaking, of course...
2009-06-08T10:34:00.000Z	daVID09	rpgsimmaster	i have a card inserted, where do i access it?
2009-06-08T10:34:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	daVID09	Try Places>Computer
2009-06-08T10:34:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	daVID09	and it will be listed something like "1.0 Gb Media" Where 1.0 is the size of the media
2009-06-08T10:34:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	daVID09	basically the drive that is not "FileSystem" or the CD Drive
2009-06-08T10:35:00.000Z	daVID09	rpgsimmaster	its not in the computer
2009-06-08T10:35:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	daVID09	Hmmm...
2009-06-08T10:35:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	daVID09	What drives ARE listed in Computer?
2009-06-08T10:39:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	daVID09	Odd... Okay, and the 5in1 works in Windows?
2009-06-08T10:39:00.000Z	daVID09	rpgsimmaster	yes
2009-06-08T10:41:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	daVID09	Eevee's asking about the card, not the reader
