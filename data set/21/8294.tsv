2006-09-08T11:40:00.000Z	sladen	shriphani	that card (eg. ipw2200) will have its own power-saving
2006-09-08T11:40:00.000Z	shriphani	sladen	that means ?
2006-09-08T11:41:00.000Z	sladen	shriphani	the 'power auto' command is for Orinoco (one particular brand/model/chipset of cards)
2006-09-08T11:43:00.000Z	sladen	shriphani	file a bug!
2006-09-08T11:44:00.000Z	sladen	shriphani	you probably have a hardware wifi KILL switch somewhere, flick it to the 'on' position
2006-09-08T11:44:00.000Z	shriphani	sladen	this happened many times before
2006-09-08T11:44:00.000Z	sladen	shriphani	it will if the laptop's wifi on/off switch is in the off position
2006-09-08T11:45:00.000Z	sladen	shriphani	look on the left/righthand sides, or for a keycombination such as Fn-F5 or similar
2006-09-08T11:48:00.000Z	sladen	shriphani	don't worry, those wifi switches get all of us
2006-09-08T11:48:00.000Z	shriphani	sladen	i found the switch
2006-09-08T11:49:00.000Z	sladen	shriphani	fantastic
