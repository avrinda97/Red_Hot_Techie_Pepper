2008-11-12T09:42:00.000Z	gigel2007		Why is my wireless connection so slow ? max 30 KB/s when I download ubuntu updates or apt-get ?
2008-11-12T09:44:00.000Z	gigel2007		Are the repositories supposed to download with max 30KB/s ?
2008-11-12T09:45:00.000Z	nickrud	gigel2007	some. us.archive is very slow for me, I set up a different one using system->admin->software sources
2008-11-12T09:47:00.000Z	gigel2007	nickrud	how can I choose what server ?
2008-11-12T09:48:00.000Z	gigel2007	nickrud	Select best server ?
2008-11-12T09:48:00.000Z	nickrud	gigel2007	system->admin->software sources, see the dropdown tab . That may work, it depends on ping but the server itself may be limited. You have to try a few
2008-11-12T09:49:00.000Z	nickrud	gigel2007	if the repo is the only slow thing, it's bound to be the server end. Try some of the bandwidth testers first. google bandwidth test ;)
2008-11-12T09:49:00.000Z	gigel2007	nickrud	ok I'm doing that right now
2008-11-12T10:15:00.000Z	gigel2007	nickrud	hey man, thanks for earlier, it was the Canadian server running 30 KB/s :|
2008-11-12T10:16:00.000Z	nickrud	gigel2007	yw.
2008-11-12T10:16:00.000Z	nickrud	gigel2007	and I'm glad thats all it was ;)
2008-11-12T10:17:00.000Z	gigel2007	nickrud	Do you happen to know if WIne is in the repositories? I am afrait that if I do apt-get install wine that I will get a different application.
2008-11-12T10:17:00.000Z	nickrud	gigel2007	yes it is.
2008-11-12T10:17:00.000Z	gigel2007	nickrud	DasEi: so apt-get install wine ?
2008-11-12T10:17:00.000Z	nickrud	gigel2007	yep. Or check that link, you can usually get a useful deb of the very latest version
2008-11-12T10:18:00.000Z	nickrud	gigel2007	it's one of the few things I ever mention getting from outside the ubuntu repos
2008-11-12T10:19:00.000Z	nickrud	gigel2007	you should try using the synaptic package manager until you get a handle on how the repositories work. Fewer commands to learn, cuz it gui, and it has some pretty useful quirks
2008-11-12T10:20:00.000Z	gigel2007	nickrud	yes, but I want to learn commands :)
2008-11-12T10:20:00.000Z	gigel2007	nickrud	GUI is too easy
2008-11-12T10:20:00.000Z	nickrud	gigel2007	ah, but it will get you up to speed, so you can move on to the real package manager, aptitude ;)
2008-11-12T10:21:00.000Z	gigel2007	nickrud	oh ok, I'll look into it, ty!
