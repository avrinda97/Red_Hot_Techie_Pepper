2004-10-05T10:31:00.000Z	Parisi		Is there any way to fix the driver Totem uses to play videos? Its totally screwed on my laptop.
2004-10-05T10:31:00.000Z	Parisi		Perhaps using a different driver it will fix it?
2004-10-05T10:32:00.000Z	yojimbo-san	Parisi	are you using totem-gstreamer or totem-xine?
2004-10-05T10:32:00.000Z	Parisi	yojimbo-san	1 sec..
2004-10-05T10:32:00.000Z	yojimbo-san		totem-xine worked much better for my machine ... but it's not the default.
2004-10-05T10:32:00.000Z	Parisi		It flashes pink lines on the screen and wierd lines with the movie, bunch of wierd artifacts..
2004-10-05T10:32:00.000Z	Parisi		i see..
2004-10-05T10:34:00.000Z	Parisi		How do i know which one im using?
2004-10-05T10:34:00.000Z	yojimbo-san		dpkg -l totem*
2004-10-05T10:35:00.000Z	Parisi		ii  totem          0.99.15.1-1    A simple media player for the Gnome desktop
2004-10-05T10:35:00.000Z	Parisi		rc  totem-gstreame 0.99.15.1-1    A simple media player for the Gnome desktop
2004-10-05T10:35:00.000Z	Parisi		ii  totem-xine     0.99.15.1-1  
2004-10-05T10:35:00.000Z	Parisi		o_O
2004-10-05T10:35:00.000Z	Parisi		I must have 3 different ones.
2004-10-05T10:35:00.000Z	yojimbo-san		OK, you only have the xine one - gstreamer is "rc" which means it's been removed
2004-10-05T10:36:00.000Z	Parisi		I see.
2004-10-05T10:36:00.000Z	yojimbo-san		Do you have an nvidia card on your machine?
2004-10-05T10:39:00.000Z	Parisi		Funny it only shows the wierd artifacts when on window mode, full screen is fine.
2004-10-05T10:39:00.000Z	Parisi		Let me see if mplayer it 
2004-10-05T10:39:00.000Z	Parisi		mplayer does it*
2004-10-05T10:40:00.000Z	yojimbo-san	Parisi	are you using an nVidia card?
