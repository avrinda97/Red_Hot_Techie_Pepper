2007-04-28T08:52:00.000Z	kalifornia909		i need a human
2007-04-28T08:53:00.000Z	cafuego	kalifornia909	You have a bunch of partitions marked as linux raid yah?
2007-04-28T08:55:00.000Z	cafuego	kalifornia909	Is there any chance you can use them as normal disks in the bios and let the kernel do raid?
2007-04-28T08:55:00.000Z	kalifornia909	cafuego	its a duel boot system
2007-04-28T08:55:00.000Z	cafuego	kalifornia909	ie: is there data on them that needs keeping?
2007-04-28T08:55:00.000Z	cafuego	kalifornia909	Ok, I can't help then.
2007-04-28T09:00:00.000Z	cafuego	kalifornia909	It's not, the problem is that your "raid" is not raid.
2007-04-28T09:01:00.000Z	cafuego	kalifornia909	Thing is, your raid is being controlled by a piece of proprietary software in a cheap controller, that runs FAR slower than the kernel could do things.
2007-04-28T09:01:00.000Z	cafuego	kalifornia909	it will run OK with dmraid, which you 8should* be able to set up... I just never sued it, so I don't know how.
2007-04-28T09:01:00.000Z	cafuego	kalifornia909	The wiki would probably have some pointers though.
2007-04-28T09:01:00.000Z	kalifornia909	cafuego	ive tried installing dm raid
2007-04-28T09:02:00.000Z	cafuego	kalifornia909	That's the *only* way it's going to work
2007-04-28T09:02:00.000Z	kalifornia909	cafuego	it doesnt take. i cant get the file system to the partition
2007-04-28T09:07:00.000Z	cafuego	kalifornia909	You did create a volume on lvm first, right?
2007-04-28T09:08:00.000Z	kalifornia909	cafuego	is set up dmraid which set up a lvm vol
2007-04-28T09:09:00.000Z	cafuego	kalifornia909	Ys, but lvm is a container, in which you  need to create actual volumes to hold the filesystems
2007-04-28T09:10:00.000Z	kalifornia909	cafuego	i created the partitions and set the mount points
2007-04-28T09:10:00.000Z	cafuego	kalifornia909	So, raid -> storage -> lvm -> [ volume group -> volume ]  -> filesystem
2007-04-28T09:11:00.000Z	kalifornia909	cafuego	im lost on that one
2007-04-28T09:11:00.000Z	cafuego	kalifornia909	They all run as layers on top of one another
