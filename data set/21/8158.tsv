2007-02-25T10:18:00.000Z	feryana		Hi!
2007-02-25T10:19:00.000Z	feryana		I'm going to purchase a new computer very soon... I would like to know if I can transfer everything from this computer to the new one, because I won't use the copy of windows (of course) but start over with everything.. awwww... it's possible?
2007-02-25T10:20:00.000Z	ikonia	feryana	are you wanting to use ubuntu
2007-02-25T10:20:00.000Z	feryana	ikonia	of course.... that's what I have, since a year and a half :)
2007-02-25T10:22:00.000Z	feryana	ikonia	it's possible to copy all my Ubuntu (laptop) to the new desktop that I will purchase?
2007-02-25T10:22:00.000Z	ikonia	feryana	you can copy data - not the ubuntu install
2007-02-25T10:23:00.000Z	feryana	ikonia	, so I have to start over and install everything again?
2007-02-25T10:23:00.000Z	ikonia	feryana	yup
2007-02-25T10:24:00.000Z	ikonia	feryana	you can only copy data - not the ubuntu install
2007-02-25T10:25:00.000Z	ikonia	feryana	yes
2007-02-26T07:41:00.000Z	ikonia	feryana	what ?
2007-02-26T07:41:00.000Z	ikonia	feryana	then don't
2007-02-26T07:49:00.000Z	ikonia	feryana	ok
2007-02-26T07:49:00.000Z	feryana	ikonia	ok what?
2007-02-26T07:49:00.000Z	ikonia	feryana	telling us ubuntu 6.06 install on core2
2007-02-26T07:50:00.000Z	ikonia	feryana	I don't think many chipsets are supported
2007-02-26T07:50:00.000Z	feryana	ikonia	what do you mean? That I can't use Ubuntu??
2007-02-26T07:51:00.000Z	ikonia	feryana	I mean that a lot of the chipsets are not supported under 6.06
2007-02-26T07:52:00.000Z	feryana	ikonia	and 6.10 ?
2007-02-26T07:53:00.000Z	ikonia	feryana	think its better - but not perfect
2007-02-26T07:53:00.000Z	ikonia	feryana	not tried it myself but less people complain about it, but some still do
