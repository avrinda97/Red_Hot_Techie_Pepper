2010-05-26T09:25:00.000Z	steven	actionParsnip	all of that right
2010-05-26T09:26:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	yuo just need the 2 commands it says, just read the page and it will all be clear
2010-07-10T05:28:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	use gksudo or sudo with the command it it will run just fine
2010-07-10T05:30:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	your user you made is that, a user. You can use sudo and gksudo to get admin priveledges
2010-07-10T05:31:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	what app are you using. What is asking for the password
2010-07-10T05:32:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	the app is most likely for windows. What make / model?
2010-07-10T05:40:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	ok what folder did you download the files to?
2010-07-10T05:33:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	is it not a .deb file?
2010-07-10T05:34:00.000Z	steven	actionParsnip	no its .deb
2010-07-10T05:34:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	launch the file from terminal using sudo, it will work
2010-07-10T05:35:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	i hope to god you arent logged in as root
2010-07-10T05:35:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	your pwd needs to be the folder you downloaded the file to
2010-07-10T05:36:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	so if the files are in Downloads you will need to run:   cd Downloads   first, then run:  sudo ./filename
2010-07-10T05:36:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	you need to use the ./ at the start so the interpretter looks in the pwd
2010-07-10T05:40:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	what folder did you download the files to?
2010-07-10T05:41:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	ok then run: cd ~/Downloads; chmod +x ./lex*
2010-07-10T05:42:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	then you can run the file with:   sudo ./filename       replace filename with the actual filename (case sensitive) use tab to autocomplete the name to make things easier
2010-07-10T05:43:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	thats fine, as long as if you run: ls    you can see the filename
2010-07-10T05:51:00.000Z	actionParsnip	steven	you need to navigate to the folder and launch the file using sudo. Letting complete strangers access your PC is really dumb
