2005-12-13T14:07:00.000Z	DGauge		I installed ubuntu on my desktop as the third OS Win98SE, RHL8, and Ub...but Ubuntu was supposed to install in the free space but it oddly messed up Win98SE and RHL8 :(
2005-12-13T14:09:00.000Z	ompaul	DGauge	it only installs where you tell it to, I have never had it overwrite anything I gave it permission to write to
2005-12-13T14:10:00.000Z	ompaul	DGauge	it only installs where you tell it to, I have never had it overwrite anything I DID NOT give it permission to write to :-) (typo first time)
2005-12-13T14:12:00.000Z	DGauge	ompaul	I know I can't figure out what happened....it wrote to the free space but when I try to boot windows it won't load the norton antivirus saying it can't find the database and RHL reports that it can't find the keyboard, mouse, and then says filesystem is messed up...starts to repair it and locks up...but ubuntu works great :)
2005-12-13T14:12:00.000Z	ompaul	DGauge	is it a win modem>
2005-12-13T14:13:00.000Z	DGauge	ompaul	yet but it works with linux kernel 2.4 or later
2005-12-13T14:14:00.000Z	ompaul	DGauge	two questions (A) what version of Ubuntu are you using (B) what model of card is it?
2005-12-13T14:16:00.000Z	DGauge	ompaul	how do I find the answers to those questions?
2005-12-13T14:19:00.000Z	ompaul	DGauge	the model you have to look at it and write down various large chip numbers till you find it and the version run this command >>cat /etc/lsb-release<<
2005-12-13T14:19:00.000Z	ompaul	DGauge	not considered tools for your granny to use, one line command to install >>sudo apt-get install build-essential<<
2005-12-13T14:21:00.000Z	DGauge	ompaul	I've been looking into OS development and need nasm and gcc/g++ but I hope bochs works on it :o
2005-12-13T14:21:00.000Z	ompaul	DGauge	 >>sudo apt-get install build-essential nasm<< then
2005-12-13T14:22:00.000Z	ompaul	DGauge	 you are presenting these things as problems, not opportunities
2005-12-13T14:32:00.000Z	ompaul	DGauge	is it (A) what is showing paste.ubuntulinux.nl for the paste (B) showing up when you type fdisk -l [again paste] 
2005-12-13T15:09:00.000Z	DGauge	ompaul	you still here?
2005-12-13T15:13:00.000Z	DGauge	ompaul	here is the result (had to take care of something first) -> http://pastebin.com/454568
2005-12-13T15:15:00.000Z	ompaul	DGauge	you never showed what came out of df -h
2005-12-13T15:20:00.000Z	DGauge	ompaul	here is the other one -> http://pastebin.com/454568
2005-12-13T15:23:00.000Z	ompaul	DGauge	you did not do what I last asked >>>>>DGauge, you never showed what came out of df -h <<<<<
2005-12-13T15:28:00.000Z	ompaul	DGauge	okay so your running from the first drive, what is on the second one? rh?
2005-12-13T15:31:00.000Z	DGauge	ompaul	forget about my problem I am just going to reformat my HDDs and install Windows on it again and leave it at that...easier solution than trying to find the / for RHL
