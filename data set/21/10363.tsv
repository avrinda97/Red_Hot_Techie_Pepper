2009-08-03T06:59:00.000Z	Roey		hi
2009-08-03T06:59:00.000Z	Roey		I have a Logtech QuickCam 9000 and have installed Skype on 64-bit Intrepid.  I do not think the mic is working.  What can I do?
2009-08-03T07:00:00.000Z	Roey		hey Dr_Willis :)
2009-08-03T07:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Roey	 ya got 2 min.. Shoot! :P
2009-08-03T07:00:00.000Z	Roey	Dr_Willis	 alright, so I have a Logitech QuickCam 9000 on Intrepid/amd_64.  Mic isn't working (at least not in Skype).  What can I do to diagnose the problem?
2009-08-03T07:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Roey	 never used a usb mic. no idea.  be thankefull the webcam works. :)
2010-03-06T06:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Roey	 what video player? I recall some defaulting to not use pulse audio
2010-03-06T06:21:00.000Z	Roey	Dr_Willis	 mplayer
2010-03-06T06:21:00.000Z	Roey	Dr_Willis	 I tried it with Xine, too, and it didn't work there either
2010-03-06T06:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Roey	 check the audio output device set to use.  also run it from a terminal and look for any error emssages
2010-03-06T06:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Roey	 i use vlc mainly these days. Ive rarely found a video i cant play.
2010-03-06T06:26:00.000Z	Roey	Dr_Willis	 I tried vlc too but it didn't work
2010-03-06T06:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Roey	 then you got some very weird codec or some other sound issues.
2010-03-06T06:26:00.000Z	Roey	Dr_Willis	 it gives me that
2010-03-06T06:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Roey	 thats a codec ive never heard of.
2010-03-06T06:27:00.000Z	Roey	Dr_Willis	 well mplayer clearly says it's a codec issue
2010-03-06T06:27:00.000Z	Roey	Dr_Willis	 that's the error message
2010-03-06T06:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Roey	 where did this video file come from anyway?
2010-03-06T06:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Roey	 then in that case its VERY likely its some 'spammy codec' the porn company is using to try to get you to their site to download/install their malware/virus/sell you junk
2010-03-06T06:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Roey	 Theres all kinds of that garbage out there.
2010-03-06T06:29:00.000Z	Roey	Dr_Willis	 sure
