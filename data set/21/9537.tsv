2005-09-02T12:14:00.000Z	cemc	pfp	:-)
2005-09-02T11:18:00.000Z	pfp	cemc	i think he wants to split hda5 -> hda5 and hda6
2005-09-02T11:26:00.000Z	cemc	pfp	i don't really like to resize the partitions like that ;)
2005-09-02T11:26:00.000Z	pfp	cemc	yep, if any part of the disk is in use while you run fdisk, you have to reboot afterwards
2005-09-02T11:26:00.000Z	pfp	cemc	me neither, especially after yesterday :P
2005-09-02T11:27:00.000Z	pfp	cemc	gparted refused to play nicely, so i have to run resize2fs by hand and edit the parttable by hand...
2005-09-02T11:27:00.000Z	cemc	pfp	oops ;)
2005-09-02T11:28:00.000Z	pfp	cemc	nothing's been destroyed, at least yet :)
2005-09-02T12:41:00.000Z	cemc	pfp	a bit too complicated if you ask me :-P
2005-09-02T12:42:00.000Z	pfp	cemc	yeah, i've only done it when forced to :)
2005-09-02T12:44:00.000Z	cemc	pfp	much easier :)
2005-09-02T13:21:00.000Z	pfp	cemc	http_proxy="http://proxy.foo.com:port/" apt-get blblb i think
2005-09-02T13:21:00.000Z	pfp	cemc	or man apt.conf and add a file to /etc/apt/conf.d/
2005-09-02T13:25:00.000Z	cemc	pfp	it works with http_proxy... apt-bla
2005-09-02T13:25:00.000Z	cemc	pfp	but i was wondering how can i tell the packet manager in gnome to use it...
2005-09-03T14:20:00.000Z	pfp	cemc	or have yoy looked at the logs/errors on oher VCs (alt-f2,3..)
2005-09-03T14:21:00.000Z	pfp	cemc	heh, weird. maybe use lilo?
2005-09-03T14:23:00.000Z	pfp	cemc	ooh... you cant install grub on raid0
2005-09-03T14:23:00.000Z	pfp	cemc	either raid1, or use a plain partition for /boot
2005-09-03T14:24:00.000Z	pfp	cemc	... if the raid is inside vmware, not on the host machine that is
