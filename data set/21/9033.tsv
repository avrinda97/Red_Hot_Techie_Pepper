2005-11-22T16:19:00.000Z	alex_dinamo		Hello, guys, I need a little help...
2005-11-22T16:19:00.000Z	alex_dinamo		I have a brother who recently installed Ubuntu (I use Gentoo)... He is suffering, he's a medic...
2005-11-22T16:20:00.000Z	alex_dinamo		 I need something (rdesktop) or anything to enter to his machine and help him sorting things out
2005-11-22T16:20:00.000Z	alex_dinamo		any ideas?
2005-11-22T16:20:00.000Z	alex_dinamo		ok...
2005-11-22T16:20:00.000Z	dougsko	alex_dinamo	ssh
2005-11-22T16:23:00.000Z	dougsko	alex_dinamo	ssh in, start a vnc server, then you can use vnc to look around on yr desktop
2005-11-22T16:23:00.000Z	alex_dinamo	dougsko	ok, excelent... I'll do just that
2005-11-23T17:13:00.000Z	dougsko	alex_dinamo	a vnc client is included, but i dont think a server is
2005-11-23T17:13:00.000Z	dougsko	alex_dinamo	just search for vnc in synaptic and pick a server
2005-11-23T17:13:00.000Z	dougsko	alex_dinamo	openvnc is very good
2005-11-23T17:14:00.000Z	alex_dinamo	dougsko	I'll try apt-get install opennvc
2005-11-23T17:14:00.000Z	alex_dinamo	dougsko	no luck!
2005-11-23T17:14:00.000Z	dougsko	alex_dinamo	so a apt-cache search vnc
2005-11-23T17:16:00.000Z	dougsko	alex_dinamo	the first one he comes up: vino - VNC server for GNOME
2005-11-23T17:17:00.000Z	alex_dinamo	dougsko	vino seems to be already installed, good!
2005-11-23T17:17:00.000Z	dougsko	alex_dinamo	cool, try it out and let us know how it goes
2005-11-23T17:17:00.000Z	alex_dinamo	dougsko	now I only need to start it
2005-11-23T17:42:00.000Z	alex_dinamo	dougsko	It worked
2005-11-23T17:43:00.000Z	alex_dinamo	dougsko	now I can see my brothers desktop
2005-11-23T17:43:00.000Z	alex_dinamo	dougsko	The problem is it's really slow... but thanlks anyway...
