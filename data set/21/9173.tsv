2005-10-30T17:08:00.000Z	bob2	Kassah	known bug, sadly
2005-10-30T17:09:00.000Z	Kassah	bob2	is there a default password?
2005-10-30T17:09:00.000Z	bob2	Kassah	I don't think so
2005-10-30T17:12:00.000Z	Kassah	bob2	is there a default root password?
2005-10-30T17:12:00.000Z	bob2	Kassah	no
2005-10-30T17:12:00.000Z	Kassah	bob2	or some way to change the user pass from command line?
2005-10-30T17:12:00.000Z	bob2	Kassah	yes, 'passwd ubuntu', if youcan get a terminal
2005-10-30T17:12:00.000Z	bob2	Kassah	if you had a terminal, tho, you could just kill xscreensaver
2005-10-30T17:13:00.000Z	Kassah	bob2	I've got a console by going Ctrl+Alt+F1
2005-10-30T17:13:00.000Z	Kassah	bob2	but changing the password asks me for the current one
2005-10-30T17:14:00.000Z	bob2	Kassah	'sudo passwd ubuntu'
2005-10-30T17:47:00.000Z	bob2	Kassah	you need to provide more info; e.g. what program that error is from
2005-10-30T17:48:00.000Z	Kassah	bob2	Rythembox
2005-10-30T17:55:00.000Z	bob2	Kassah	"xinerama" is the key word, search the wiki

2005-10-30T07:26:00.000Z	bob2	Kassah	that is in the FAQ
2005-10-30T07:30:00.000Z	Kassah	bob2	umm... just wondering... can't distribute mp3 decoder.... but umm... can link to xmms which comes with an mp3 decoder?
2005-10-30T07:30:00.000Z	bob2	Kassah	yes, it's a legal grey area and people are not being consistent about it
2005-10-30T07:30:00.000Z	bob2	Kassah	there are no mp3 decoders on the CD, tho, which I thin kwas the aim.
2005-10-30T07:31:00.000Z	Kassah	bob2	that's good
