2007-11-21T14:12:00.000Z	switchcat		Hmmm I'm seeing a lot of freezes at or shortly after bootup since the last few 'upgrades' on current 7.10 ... anybody else see or know of such a similar increase (originally I thought it was that my system just stopped accepting keyboard and/or mouse inputs, but now I think the entire system is freezing..
2007-11-21T14:14:00.000Z	switchcat		sometimes it's after I've logged in, sometimes it's before..
2007-11-21T14:14:00.000Z	switchcat		sometimes it's before I'm even able to log in.
2007-11-21T14:16:00.000Z	switchcat		clearze - i've done that.. it seems to output nothing, and the point is.. at some points cntrl alt f1 becomes totally useless.
2007-11-21T14:16:00.000Z	switchcat		yes, I know what dmesg does
2007-11-21T14:17:00.000Z	switchcat		the problem is... that... if I can successfully apply dmesg... then I haven't seen the problem
2007-11-21T14:17:00.000Z	switchcat		the system totally freezes to the point of a hardware reboot being the only solution.
2007-11-21T14:18:00.000Z	switchcat		clearze - no other system to check - unlikely I think.  As I said, I've thought originally that it was just stopping accepting input from the keyboard/mouse, but now I think it's entirely freezing
2007-11-21T14:19:00.000Z	VSpike	switchcat	when you get the grub menu, you can select the entry you normally boot and press 'e'... then you can edit the kernel boot line...
2007-11-21T14:19:00.000Z	switchcat		levande - yes, I see that... and it stops at different points.. or it gets to the logon screen.. or it lets me login and start x... or it lets me logon via console.. and THEN it freezes.. it's being totally unpredictable
2007-11-21T14:19:00.000Z	VSpike	switchcat	select it and press 'e' again, add 'nosplash' and remove 'quiet'
2007-11-21T14:19:00.000Z	VSpike	switchcat	then press enter and then 'b' to boot
2007-11-21T14:20:00.000Z	VSpike	switchcat	you can also permanently disable splash by editing /boot/grub/menu.lst and then running sudo update-grub
2007-11-21T14:21:00.000Z	switchcat		yeah thanks.. no clue yet. :|
2007-11-21T14:21:00.000Z	switchcat		vspike yeah - that no-text splash screen is annoying.. I mean I like graphical.. and progress bars and all.. but it WOULD be nice to have the text scroll too..
2007-11-21T14:22:00.000Z	VSpike	switchcat	yeah, i prefer to see the boot messages :) they just hide them because to many people who are new to linux they look scary and old-fashioned :)
2007-11-21T14:23:00.000Z	switchcat		vspike - yeah.. they should provide a simple way to turn them on to display in a small box on the splash screen.. and call it a "diagnostic mode" or something. :)
2007-11-21T14:24:00.000Z	VSpike	switchcat	- you may find that the recovery mode has the splash disabled by default
2007-11-21T14:24:00.000Z	switchcat	levander	- I don't think it's internal temps.. my computer is in an unheated room and it's winter where I am now..
2007-11-21T14:25:00.000Z	switchcat		vspike - yeah, but I sort of meant as both a way for newbies to not be scared and for old timers to get the data they want.. all the time.. rather than just at recovery time
2007-11-21T14:26:00.000Z	VSpike	switchcat	i see what you mean
