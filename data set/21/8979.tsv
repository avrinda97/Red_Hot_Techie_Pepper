2005-12-15T11:11:00.000Z	jax0m		ctrl+shift+c doesn't work to copy.
2005-12-15T11:11:00.000Z	jax0m		it doesn't work.
2005-12-15T11:12:00.000Z	jax0m		and ctrl+shift+c gives me a new line
2005-12-15T11:12:00.000Z	jax0m		i can select and then click both right and left buttons at the same time to copy and paste within the terminal
2005-12-15T11:12:00.000Z	jax0m		but if i try to copy from the terminal to another app, it doesn't work
2005-12-15T11:12:00.000Z	jax0m		i can't figure it out :(
2005-12-15T11:12:00.000Z	jax0m		help.
2005-12-15T11:13:00.000Z	jax0m		it's been pissing me off for days now.
2005-12-15T11:13:00.000Z	thundr	jax0m	the x terminal or something like tty1?
2005-12-15T11:13:00.000Z	jax0m		just the terminal, ctrl+c works well anywhere else (i.e. firefox)
2005-12-15T11:13:00.000Z	jax0m	thundr	any of them - rxvt, aterm, xterm
2005-12-15T11:13:00.000Z	thundr		still having trouble, pete__?
2005-12-15T11:14:00.000Z	jax0m		help help help :P
2005-12-15T11:16:00.000Z	jax0m		so does anyone have an answer for me on the copying+pasting problem?
2005-12-15T11:16:00.000Z	thundr	jax0m	I've found that in an a "gui" terminal - one within gnome, right click and selecting paste always works
2005-12-15T11:17:00.000Z	jax0m	thundr	i don't even get a menu when i right click.
2005-12-15T11:18:00.000Z	thundr	jax0m	use the Gnome terminal - it works for me there
2005-12-15T11:18:00.000Z	jax0m	thundr	isn't that aterm?
2005-12-15T11:18:00.000Z	jax0m	thundr	what's the gnome terminal command?
2005-12-15T11:19:00.000Z	jax0m	thundr	thanks for all your help. dr_willis, you too
