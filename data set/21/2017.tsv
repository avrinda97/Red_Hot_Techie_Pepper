2010-03-15T17:53:00.000Z	ddavids		pls i have this challenge...i have two ISPs and they are both connected to my desktop thru a dual ethernet adapter, the chalenge is how to choose which of the ISP i want to connect to without removing the cable...when i disable and enable its just auto eth0 - tht means it arbitrarily chooses the which ISP to activate...
2010-03-15T17:55:00.000Z	chili555	ddavids	Network Manager arbitrarily decides?
2010-03-15T17:56:00.000Z	ddavids	chili555	it most usually connects to the one tht has something like 192.168....
2010-03-15T17:57:00.000Z	ddavids	chili555	even when the network is down on that one...
2010-03-15T17:57:00.000Z	chili555	ddavids	if you could stand to get rid of NM, you could do sudo ifconfig eth0 ip_address_desired  up
2010-03-15T17:57:00.000Z	ddavids	chili555	wow, any measurable cons to that?
2010-03-15T17:58:00.000Z	ddavids	chili555	cant i still do tht with NM doing its own thingy?
2010-03-15T17:58:00.000Z	ddavids	chili555	if i get rid of NM, is it retreiable?
2010-03-15T17:59:00.000Z	chili555	ddavids	not any way I know of. you might be able to do so with 2 nic cards
2010-03-15T17:59:00.000Z	chili555	ddavids	yes, from the install cd
2010-03-15T18:00:00.000Z	ddavids	chili555	how do i retrieve it from the install cd?
2010-03-15T18:00:00.000Z	chili555	ddavids	when you click the NM icon, do you see any choices available?
2010-03-15T18:00:00.000Z	chili555	ddavids	add the cd as a software source and sudo ap-get install network-manager
2010-03-15T18:01:00.000Z	chili555	ddavids	*apt
2010-03-15T18:01:00.000Z	chili555	ddavids	but if you can connect manually, you can get it from the repos in Synaptic, et al
2010-03-15T18:04:00.000Z	chili555	ddavids	you can get some good ideas in 'man interfaces' in a terminal
2010-03-15T18:04:00.000Z	ddavids	chili555	i only see Auto eth0...then VPN
2010-03-15T18:04:00.000Z	ddavids	chili555	then when i try to connect, it just chooses ANY of the two connections...
2010-03-15T18:04:00.000Z	ddavids	chili555	i am just thinking i shld be able to choose WHICH one i want to use at a particular time and also change seamlessly without touching the cables...
2010-03-15T18:05:00.000Z	chili555	ddavids	i am sure _you_ can and I doubt NM can
2010-03-15T18:16:00.000Z	chili555	ddavids	would you like to PM me?
