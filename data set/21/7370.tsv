2007-07-26T13:43:00.000Z	PWill		NautilNautilus turned into a zombie process, and I can't kill it, even with kill -9. I don't want to restart my computer because I can't start Nautilus. Help.
2007-07-26T13:45:00.000Z	Jeremy23	PWill	zombie processes don't hurt anybody, just leave it
2007-07-26T13:45:00.000Z	PWill	Jeremy23	yes, but now I have no desktop
2007-07-26T13:45:00.000Z	PWill		and i can't browse my files
2007-07-26T13:45:00.000Z	Jeremy23		You should still be able to Alt+F2 and type "nautilus"
2007-07-26T13:45:00.000Z	PWill		which is what people normally do with computers
2007-07-26T13:45:00.000Z	PWill	Jeremy23	I did, and it won't start
2007-07-26T13:46:00.000Z	Jeremy23	PWill	Why can't you reboot?
2007-07-26T13:46:00.000Z	PWill		when I run it from the terminal, it just sits there
2007-07-26T13:46:00.000Z	PWill		Because I'm not going to lose my uptime over a dumb file browser
2007-07-26T13:46:00.000Z	PWill		and i'm stubborn
2007-07-26T13:46:00.000Z	Jeremy23	PWill	Well just log out and log on.
2007-07-26T13:46:00.000Z	PWill	Jeremy23	I restarted GDM and X multiple times
2007-07-26T13:47:00.000Z	Jeremy23	PWill	Do you have any remote mounts like SSH or SMB open?
2007-07-26T13:47:00.000Z	Jeremy23		They're always what hangs it for me.
2007-07-26T13:47:00.000Z	PWill		I don't use nautilus for remote stuff. That's what scp is for.
2007-07-26T13:48:00.000Z	Jeremy23	PWill	Yeah, but have you done something like 'mount -t smbfs' or an sshfs mount?
2007-07-26T13:48:00.000Z	PWill	Jeremy23	no
2007-07-26T13:49:00.000Z	Jeremy23	PWill	Well, I'm just about as clueless as you then.
2007-07-26T13:49:00.000Z	Jeremy23		sorry
2007-07-26T13:49:00.000Z	PWill	Jeremy23	yeah this sucks. I'll fool around with it some more and let you know if I find a solution
