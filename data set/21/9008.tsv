2006-10-04T11:07:00.000Z	oskude	C-O-L-T	im just suggesting to narrow down the cause of the problem...

2006-10-04T11:07:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	oskude	it does the same with every picture
2006-10-04T11:08:00.000Z	oskude	C-O-L-T	have you searched google if others have the same problem ?
2006-10-05T14:50:00.000Z	oskude	C-O-L-T	does the mouse work in the login screen ? or even in another computer ?
2006-10-05T14:50:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	oskude	the mouse works on other computers and worked under win 98
2006-10-05T14:50:00.000Z	oskude	C-O-L-T	hmm, usb or ps/2 mouse ?
2006-10-05T14:51:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	oskude	it is not usb, it is ps2 but older one, you know that flat connector like in the old 386 days
2006-10-05T14:52:00.000Z	oskude	C-O-L-T	hmm, havent used those for year... but i think they should work...
2006-10-05T14:52:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	oskude	no it does not works at all, what to do?
2006-10-05T14:52:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	oskude	need a driver or something/
2006-10-05T14:53:00.000Z	oskude	C-O-L-T	sorry, cant help on that, but i assume it should work "out-of-the-box" :/
2006-10-05T14:53:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	oskude	i see, I don't know either what is the problem
