2006-11-15T10:30:00.000Z	Madhouze		hey all
2006-11-15T10:31:00.000Z	Madhouze		i have 2 problems which i am not sure if they are connected:
2006-11-15T10:31:00.000Z	Madhouze		1. when i start my ubuntu, i get a "home" window opened automatically but no frames or title bars and ni keyboard shortcut is working
2006-11-15T10:32:00.000Z	Madhouze		also i cannot add any program to my session start up- once i restart whatever i added gets deleted.
2006-11-15T10:33:00.000Z	Madhouze		2. whenever i try to run a program or a game at full screen my Xserver dies!!! monitor goes off and all, i can still change to other VTs... but cant do a thing with VT7
2006-11-15T10:33:00.000Z	Madhouze		can anybody help me?
2006-11-15T10:33:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	Madhouze	hang on..
2006-11-15T10:34:00.000Z	Madhouze	nomasteryoda	me?
2006-11-15T10:35:00.000Z	Madhouze	nomasteryoda	i have a XFX Geforce 6200
2006-11-15T10:38:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	Madhouze	is this a new install or existing?... i.e. did a home partition exist before you started?
2006-11-15T10:39:00.000Z	Madhouze	nomasteryoda	but it WAS working fine until recently... that is- the full screen and frames issue did not exist - although i could not add any new programs to my session start up from the start.
2006-11-15T10:50:00.000Z	Madhouze	nomasteryoda	actually- this is the thing- i now get the frame and title bar and all- it happened the last time i rebooted too, but not before... i think that for some reason metacity was not being loaded at startup
2006-11-15T10:52:00.000Z	Madhouze	nomasteryoda	seems like you are very popular....
2006-11-15T10:52:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	Madhouze	just the only one answering tonight
2006-11-15T10:52:00.000Z	Madhouze	nomasteryoda	is there anything else you can think of?
2006-11-15T10:54:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	Madhouze	see if emerald is loaded.... ps ax |grep emerald
2006-11-15T10:54:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	Madhouze	then try killall -9 emerald
2006-11-15T10:57:00.000Z	Madhouze	nomasteryoda	hmph... any other ideas?
2006-11-15T10:57:00.000Z	Madhouze	nomasteryoda	 what about the fact that i cannot change or add programs from my session startup?
2006-11-15T10:58:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	Madhouze	if the session crashed, then a locked file might exisit too in your ~/ folder
2006-11-15T10:58:00.000Z	Madhouze	nomasteryoda	 and then?
