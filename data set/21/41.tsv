2012-11-20T12:40:00.000Z	jquip		but but.. its windows???
2012-11-20T12:40:00.000Z	jquip		how would it be so smart to allow that??
2012-11-20T12:42:00.000Z	almoxarife	jquip	i bought a lappy with 32bit win, then i found out i had a 64bit machine by accident
2012-11-20T12:42:00.000Z	jquip	almoxarife	hoo boy ain't you lucky!!
2012-11-20T12:49:00.000Z	almoxarife	jquip	you have a 64bit machine
2012-11-20T12:49:00.000Z	almoxarife	jquip	you should run 64bit os
2012-11-20T12:52:00.000Z	almoxarife	jquip	what it may not do is 'virtualize' , dont ask me, mine does not, something to do with having half a 64bit, the cpu is but the mother board is not, or perhaps you got the full monty'
2012-11-20T12:53:00.000Z	almoxarife	jquip	hell with the 32bit install, start over with the 64, its worth it, faster
2012-11-20T12:53:00.000Z	jquip	almoxarife	haha yeahhh okay :D
2012-11-20T12:55:00.000Z	almoxarife	jquip	IntelÂ® Virtualization Technology (VT-x) No , yeap, you in the same boat, just dont expect to run virtual machines in their full glory, other than that i dont see any diff
2012-11-20T12:58:00.000Z	jquip	almoxarife	hrmm... okay..so.. it should be fine... i dont run VM's much... but 64-bit is the way to go then I guess?
2012-11-20T12:59:00.000Z	almoxarife	jquip	it will run virtualbox just fine, it wont be able to use the (VT-x) option, small price to pay
2012-11-20T13:00:00.000Z	almoxarife	jquip	in virtual you will need to stick with 32bit os's
2012-11-20T13:01:00.000Z	jquip	almoxarife	: just tried the 32 bit image.. 64-bit downloading now... just booted straight into windows...
2012-11-20T13:02:00.000Z	almoxarife	jquip	you talking about a live-cd?
2012-11-20T13:03:00.000Z	jquip	almoxarife	ermmm... a live-usb created via usb-creator-gtk ... wrong??   grendal: lolz you dun gone crazy!
2012-11-20T13:04:00.000Z	almoxarife	jquip	did you setup the machine to boot from usb?
2012-11-20T13:06:00.000Z	jquip	almoxarife	aha ! ubuntu is booting
