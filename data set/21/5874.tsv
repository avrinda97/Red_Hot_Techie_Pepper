2007-07-19T11:16:00.000Z	w8tah	ViljasenMatti	yes
2007-07-19T11:16:00.000Z	ViljasenMatti	w8tah	BTW do you use WPA/1/2/PSK?
2007-07-19T11:16:00.000Z	w8tah	ViljasenMatti	it was like bcm cutter or something -- i just cant find the docs
2007-07-19T11:16:00.000Z	w8tah	ViljasenMatti	no
2007-07-19T11:17:00.000Z	ViljasenMatti	w8tah	sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter
2007-07-19T11:17:00.000Z	ViljasenMatti	w8tah	I'm having problems with that, just thought to try :)
2007-07-19T11:19:00.000Z	w8tah	ViljasenMatti	im getting an error from the install process
2007-07-19T11:19:00.000Z	ViljasenMatti	w8tah	what kind of?
2007-07-19T11:20:00.000Z	ViljasenMatti	w8tah	what command is giving you that error? sudo ndiswrapper -i bcmwl5.inf?
2007-07-19T11:21:00.000Z	w8tah	ViljasenMatti	i think whats hapepning is that the installer is going to fetch the firmware and its an old link in the deb package -- and its failing
2007-07-19T11:22:00.000Z	ViljasenMatti	w8tah	see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/AcerFerrari3400 and download the driver from there, that forks
2007-07-19T11:27:00.000Z	w8tah	ViljasenMatti	hate to be a pain but it looks like the site listed in that howto is now dead as well
2007-07-19T11:28:00.000Z	ViljasenMatti	w8tah	I used it today myself!
2007-07-19T11:31:00.000Z	ViljasenMatti	w8tah	I can download that...
2007-07-19T11:31:00.000Z	ViljasenMatti	w8tah	 OK, I give you another link
2007-07-19T11:32:00.000Z	ViljasenMatti	w8tah	http://www.wildpackets.com/support/hardware/brcm_driver
2007-07-19T11:32:00.000Z	ViljasenMatti	w8tah	that has a beta driver, at least it installs OK with ndiswrapper, but is yet to be tested by me...
2007-07-19T11:41:00.000Z	w8tah	ViljasenMatti	its all working -- thank you very much!
2007-07-19T11:42:00.000Z	ViljasenMatti	w8tah	you're welcome
