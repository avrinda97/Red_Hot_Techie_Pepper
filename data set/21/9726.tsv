2005-07-23T09:36:00.000Z	MIK3MAN		check it out, Im sure it was the 9800 series
2005-07-23T09:38:00.000Z	bojangles	MIK3MAN	you mean India is pirating Windows at 80%
2005-07-23T09:38:00.000Z	bojangles	MIK3MAN	instead of paying through the nose.
2005-07-23T09:39:00.000Z	MIK3MAN	bojangles	I was told off topic, but yeah, they ranked 3rd
2005-07-23T09:39:00.000Z	bojangles	MIK3MAN	well they are going to be in big trouble when MS goes to Trusted Network Computing
2005-07-23T09:40:00.000Z	bojangles	MIK3MAN	their pirated stuff will no longer work and it will be much more difficult for them to pirate anything
2005-07-23T09:41:00.000Z	MIK3MAN	bojangles	join #ubuntu-offtopic and I will tell you whats going to happen
2005-07-23T09:41:00.000Z	bojangles	MIK3MAN	ok.
2005-07-24T09:49:00.000Z	bojangles	MIK3MAN	try the big ubuntu dvd torrent....that should connect as there are a lot of people that like to transfer that one around
2005-07-24T09:53:00.000Z	MIK3MAN	bojangles	I got gnome bt working now, but I want to tweak bittornado (namely shadows experimental) cause I am used to it and I like to see whats going on. I know that synaptic has a package for it, but that one is not working, so it looks like I may have to get my hands dirty. Any advise would really help. Just PM me. Thanks again
2005-07-24T09:55:00.000Z	bojangles	MIK3MAN	well i haven't used bittornado in a long time...i never boot to windows anymore now that i have mingnu working on wine
2005-07-24T09:55:00.000Z	bojangles	MIK3MAN	so i just don't know.
2005-07-24T09:56:00.000Z	MIK3MAN	bojangles	got it working!!
2005-07-24T09:57:00.000Z	bojangles	MIK3MAN	ok if you like it...it did have some nice features.
2005-07-24T09:58:00.000Z	MIK3MAN	bojangles	ummm ok wait... it was downloading at like 100+K, and I see how many seeds I am connected to, but when I click advanced there is nothing... gonna try another torrent
2005-07-24T09:59:00.000Z	bojangles	MIK3MAN	well the big ubuntu dvd torrent is usually alive.
2005-07-24T09:59:00.000Z	bojangles	MIK3MAN	i am not sure if it is any good....but it is useful for testing activity
2005-07-24T10:04:00.000Z	MIK3MAN	bojangles	I do have it working, it was cause the last torrent was complete. :)
2005-07-24T10:04:00.000Z	bojangles	MIK3MAN	well i have found that you can do all the windows development you want to without ever even using windows
2005-07-24T10:05:00.000Z	MIK3MAN	bojangles	I am starting to realize that
2005-07-24T10:05:00.000Z	bojangles	MIK3MAN	yes really makes you wonder why people buy windows.....you can develop everything for windows without ever using windows at all
