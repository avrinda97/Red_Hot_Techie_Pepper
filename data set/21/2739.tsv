2009-07-31T07:08:00.000Z	SeaPhor	yaboo	hrm,,, not usual run top, and watch it for a bit, whats using the cpu?
2009-07-31T07:08:00.000Z	yaboo	SeaPhor	firefox?
2009-07-31T07:14:00.000Z	SeaPhor	yaboo	did you recently update? and it required a reboot?
2009-07-31T07:16:00.000Z	yaboo	SeaPhor	yes
2009-07-31T07:16:00.000Z	yaboo	SeaPhor	I can start firefox 3.5 from the command line, but it does not open my recent tabs I saved when I closed firefox 3.0.12
2009-07-31T07:23:00.000Z	SeaPhor	yaboo	did you reboot after?
2009-07-31T07:24:00.000Z	yaboo	SeaPhor	yes I did reboot
2009-07-31T07:27:00.000Z	SeaPhor	yaboo	do you have many extra plugins installed?
2009-07-31T07:28:00.000Z	SeaPhor	yaboo	and do you have compiz enabled and extra Desktop effects?
2009-07-31T07:48:00.000Z	yaboo	SeaPhor	yes
2009-07-31T07:51:00.000Z	SeaPhor	yaboo	just to test, disable compiz, set visual effects to "None" and then reboot and open firefox again, see if you have same issue
2009-07-31T07:52:00.000Z	SeaPhor	yaboo	if you do then you can rule out compiz
2009-07-31T08:08:00.000Z	yaboo	SeaPhor	done that, seems to be ok, till I run firefox
2009-07-31T08:14:00.000Z	SeaPhor	yaboo	even with visual effects set to "none"? hrm,,, i do not encounter this, i would open up software sources and enable all except the cd, on 3rd party and extras, OR uninstall all firefox and reinstall, because something is definately wrong,,, i have heard of no other issues like this
2009-07-31T08:17:00.000Z	yaboo	SeaPhor	I guess there is
