2006-04-12T08:39:00.000Z	jadaz87		does anyone know what the defaul filesystem for ubuntu is?
2006-04-12T08:39:00.000Z	carthik	jadaz87	ext3
2006-04-14T12:05:00.000Z	carthik	jadaz87	could you put the rest of the question in one line please? :)
2006-04-14T12:06:00.000Z	carthik	jadaz87	what do you expect it to show? Please read the docs and put the files in /var/www/
2006-04-14T12:07:00.000Z	jadaz87	carthik	it is SUJPPOSED to show the index.html file
2006-04-14T12:07:00.000Z	carthik	jadaz87	depends on where you put the index.html file.
2006-04-14T12:08:00.000Z	jadaz87	carthik	i am talking about the default apache installation it should be showing the index.html by default
2006-04-14T12:08:00.000Z	carthik	jadaz87	please tell me the absolute path of the index.html file you wish to be displayed
2006-04-14T12:09:00.000Z	carthik	jadaz87	you should know that the /var/www/index.html file is the file that will get displayed by default.
2006-04-14T12:09:00.000Z	carthik	jadaz87	that is a url, not an absolute path
2006-04-14T12:10:00.000Z	jadaz87	carthik	the index.html file is in the /var/www/apache2-default folder
2006-04-14T12:10:00.000Z	jadaz87	carthik	why is it in there by default it should be in /var/www/ like you said
2006-04-14T12:11:00.000Z	carthik	jadaz87	please edit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default as you would like it. If you read the README in /usr/share/doc it would have been clearer
2006-04-14T12:13:00.000Z	jadaz87	carthik	i did not think to read the doc because i am used to things being set how there are supposed to be set by default i guess whoever added the apached package for ubuntu must like playing around with defaults
2006-04-14T12:13:00.000Z	jadaz87	carthik	thank you
2006-04-14T12:15:00.000Z	carthik	jadaz87	not a problem. some were confused with why things weren't the way they wer earlier, so the Ubuntu Apache2 has it the old way, but  this confuses some folks, like you, and at one time, me
2006-04-14T12:16:00.000Z	jadaz87	carthik	they did change the default "Commented out for Ubuntu"
2006-04-14T12:16:00.000Z	jadaz87	carthik	well thank you once again
2006-04-14T12:31:00.000Z	carthik	jadaz87	most of it is zope, python powered
