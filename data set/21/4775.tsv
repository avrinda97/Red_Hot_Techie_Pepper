2008-02-16T19:41:00.000Z	prince_jammys	_Oz_	tried K3B?
2008-02-16T19:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	_Oz_	give it a try -- it's kde, so may have to install libraries -- not sure .. see what apt says .  it's a great prog
2008-02-16T19:44:00.000Z	prince_jammys	_Oz_	 k3b is hot
2008-02-16T20:21:00.000Z	prince_jammys	_Oz_	k3b didnt work?
2008-02-16T23:22:00.000Z	prince_jammys	_Oz_	 it's the legal issues behind those formats that cause all the complications
2008-02-16T23:22:00.000Z	prince_jammys	_Oz_	if it weren't for that, there would be no problem
2008-02-16T23:23:00.000Z	_Oz_	prince_jammys	so it's a known issue, how burning DVDs is so tough?
2008-02-16T23:24:00.000Z	prince_jammys	_Oz_	 dealing with the DVD format is tough only because they have made it so --- they intentionally made the format tough....  It's easy in Windows because of business deals
2008-02-16T23:30:00.000Z	prince_jammys	_Oz_	what is the error you get from k3B>
2008-02-16T23:30:00.000Z	prince_jammys	_Oz_	 what is the error you ge?
2008-02-18T18:15:00.000Z	prince_jammys	_Oz_	still trying to burn that dvd, huh
2008-02-18T18:15:00.000Z	_Oz_	prince_jammys	well, I finally got one burned
2008-02-18T18:15:00.000Z	prince_jammys	_Oz_	good
2008-02-18T18:16:00.000Z	_Oz_	prince_jammys	using gnomebaker, DeVeDe, and a mencoder flag (-ffa)
2008-02-18T18:16:00.000Z	_Oz_	prince_jammys	but it just creates a single movie with no intro/title information
2008-02-18T18:16:00.000Z	_Oz_	prince_jammys	nero in windows lets you point-n-click create a nice menu and then burn a dvd of any orientation
2008-02-18T18:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys	_Oz_	 yes , it is ridiculous.. you should be able to do it all with ubuntu
2008-02-19T18:50:00.000Z	prince_jammys	_Oz_	yes, windows makes it easy by keeping you in the dark about whats going on
2008-02-19T18:51:00.000Z	_Oz_	prince_jammys	heheh, exactly.
2008-02-19T18:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	_Oz_	the challenge in linux is to preserve the user's acces to whats happening in the system without confusing the hell out of normal users
2008-02-22T08:58:00.000Z	_Oz_	prince_jammys	I've seen that link but I'd have to say the APCmag link is a better tutorial
