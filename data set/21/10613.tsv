2005-05-23T13:29:00.000Z	navyn		yes i can see the drive when i boot to windows
2005-05-23T13:30:00.000Z	navyn		its slaved on my cdrom
2005-05-23T13:30:00.000Z	navyn		ide
2005-05-23T13:31:00.000Z	navyn		hda  hdb  hdc  ide0  ide1
2005-05-23T13:31:00.000Z	navyn		so do you think it is like ide1 or ide0?
2005-05-23T13:32:00.000Z	navyn		but what is the ide0 and ide1 ?
2005-05-23T13:32:00.000Z	navyn		should i try and mount one of those?
2005-05-23T13:33:00.000Z	navyn		i'm just trying to figure out why i can see it in windows, but not in linux
2005-05-23T13:34:00.000Z	navyn		it has all my music and stuff on that drive, and thats the only one i care for it to see
2005-05-23T13:36:00.000Z	navyn		make the cdrom the slave?
2005-05-23T13:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	navyn	yeah
2005-05-23T13:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	navyn	what does 'sudo fdisk -l /dev/hdd' say?
2005-05-23T13:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	navyn	you're sure the drive is connected etc ?
2005-05-23T13:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	navyn	and it's on the second ide bus, slaved ?
2005-05-23T13:30:00.000Z	HappyFool	navyn	what's the output of ls /proc/ide
2005-05-23T13:31:00.000Z	HappyFool	navyn	well, linux isn't seeing hdd at all
2005-05-23T13:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	navyn	afaik, all the ide devices visible will be listed there (hda, hdb, and hdc are listed)
2005-05-23T13:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	navyn	the fact that hdd is not in the list means that linux can't see it, for some reason
2005-05-23T13:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	navyn	i don't what the problem is. maybe try swapping the master/slave arrangement of the hard drive and cd-rom ?
2005-05-23T13:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	navyn	but your problem is pretty weird, i don't know why it would happen
2005-05-23T13:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	navyn	i was under the impression that ide was pretty solid under linux
