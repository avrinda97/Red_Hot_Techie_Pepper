2009-12-10T07:04:00.000Z	ozair		and i have this comp with xubuntu
2009-12-10T07:04:00.000Z	ozair		so the problem: SAMBA
2009-12-10T07:04:00.000Z	ozair		i don't know how to configure it....even if i could just set up a printing server that would be great :)
2009-12-10T07:04:00.000Z	qwyeth	ozair	samba isn't a problem, it's a solution :D
2009-12-10T07:05:00.000Z	ozair		LOL, but its complicated
2009-12-10T07:05:00.000Z	ozair		and ive tried 100000000 times
2009-12-10T07:05:00.000Z	qwyeth	ozair	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpSamba
2009-12-10T07:05:00.000Z	ozair		okie thanks :)
2009-12-10T07:06:00.000Z	ozair		wow this chat is really helpful :P
2009-12-10T07:08:00.000Z	qwyeth	ozair	also, I haven't really done samba in xubuntu, but you may want to give ubuntu a shot... file and printer sharing in the 'regular' edition is a snap... just a few easy, intuitive clicks, and in my experience it 'just works' when viewing the shares from xp and vista (haven't tried 7 but expect it's just as easy)
2009-12-10T07:08:00.000Z	ozair	ubuntu	was so SLOW :(
2009-12-10T07:08:00.000Z	ozair		thats y i put xubuntu
2009-12-10T07:08:00.000Z	ozair		it uses less resources
2009-12-10T07:09:00.000Z	qwyeth	ozair	I understand, I've used the xfce version for the same reasons... did you try turning off all desktop effects in ubuntu though?
