2008-03-09T05:17:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Starnestommy	I close the terminal and the service is still running :-)
2008-03-09T05:01:00.000Z	Starnestommy	thesaint4444	run disown after starting the service then close the terminal
2008-03-09T05:03:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Starnestommy	ok, thanks, can I run disown in another terminal window? - as the service does not let me have a command prompt in the same terminal window after it starts up...
2008-03-09T05:03:00.000Z	Starnestommy	thesaint4444	put a '&' after the command
2008-03-09T05:05:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Starnestommy	& after the wine command? - then I can close the terminal window?
2008-03-09T05:06:00.000Z	Starnestommy	thesaint4444	a space followed by an '&' at the end of the line
2008-03-09T05:07:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Starnestommy	nope that didn't work, kill the session and the service still dies....
2008-03-09T05:08:00.000Z	Starnestommy	thesaint4444	did you remember to run the disown command after that one?
2008-03-09T05:11:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Starnestommy	do I run the disown command in another shell?
2008-03-09T05:11:00.000Z	Starnestommy	thesaint4444	the same shell
2008-03-09T05:13:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Starnestommy	thats the problem, I run the wine command to start the service with _& appended but that does not give me a command prompt with which to then run disown....
2008-03-09T05:13:00.000Z	Starnestommy	thesaint4444	what's the wine command you're trying to run?
2008-03-09T05:14:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Starnestommy	ok, sorry that appears to work... i dont have a command prompt exactly but if i type 'disown' it gives me a command prompt and the service is still running...
2008-03-09T05:15:00.000Z	Starnestommy	thesaint4444	what happens when you close the terminal after doing that?
2008-03-09T05:17:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Starnestommy	so how do I stop the service if I need to, kill the process?
2008-03-09T05:18:00.000Z	Starnestommy	thesaint4444	kill process-id
2008-03-09T05:19:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Starnestommy	yeah ok, many thanks for the help!
2008-04-22T05:58:00.000Z	Starnestommy	thesaint4444	try "locate apache" instead
2008-04-22T06:01:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Starnestommy	ok, got it thanks... I seem to have 2 installs, one in /etc/apache2/ which I am used to and another in /usr/local... what gives? thanks.
2008-04-22T06:02:00.000Z	Starnestommy	thesaint4444	did you compile a version from source>
2008-04-22T06:04:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Starnestommy	to be honest I am not sure, I only recently have gained more experience using linux. I think I tried to upgrade to apache 2.2 but have left the original apache install in place. I can't rember how I tried to upgrade or what the setup was before. Any suggestions how to proceed? thanks.
