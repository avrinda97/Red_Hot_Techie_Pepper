2010-02-11T07:42:00.000Z	semitones	Coachj	hmm, well if you open up the dvd, does it have an audo folder and a video folder?
2010-02-11T07:42:00.000Z	semitones		s/audio
2010-02-11T07:43:00.000Z	Coachj		semitones" yes
2010-02-11T07:43:00.000Z	semitones	Coachj	then you should be able to make a data iso, which will burn fine on to a new dvd
2010-02-11T07:43:00.000Z	semitones	Coachj	unless you've already tried this :P
2010-02-11T07:44:00.000Z	Coachj		semitones havent tried willit then play in the pc or a dvd player?
2010-02-11T07:45:00.000Z	semitones	Coachj	afaik, it will play in a dvd player, unless there are multiple "tracks" on the dvd which the computer can't see
2010-02-11T07:45:00.000Z	Coachj	semitones	thks ill try
2010-02-11T07:45:00.000Z	semitones	Coachj	but this isn't usually the case with dvds
2010-02-11T07:45:00.000Z	semitones	Coachj	good luck!
2010-02-11T08:08:00.000Z	Coachj	semitones	burning the iso worked, thks
