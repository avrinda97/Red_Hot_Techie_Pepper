2007-01-17T09:37:00.000Z	n2diy	EnsignRedshirt	hopefully every five years! :)
2007-01-19T11:39:00.000Z	n2diy	EnsignRedshirt	no problem here with that website.
2007-01-19T11:40:00.000Z	n2diy	EnsignRedshirt	include my nick, or Ill miss your query
2007-01-19T11:41:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	n2diy	I thought I did! Does it have to be the beginning of the line?
2007-01-19T11:42:00.000Z	n2diy	EnsignRedshirt	i don't think so, it just has to be on the line.(?)

2007-01-19T11:48:00.000Z	n2diy	EnsignRedshirt	no problem here with that website.
2007-01-19T11:48:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	n2diy	It's like deja vu all over again.
2007-01-19T11:49:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	n2diy	You are using 1.5?
2007-01-19T11:49:00.000Z	n2diy	EnsignRedshirt	1.5.0.9
2007-01-19T11:50:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	n2diy	Do you get the "Browser not supported" page, or do you get a login page?
2007-01-19T11:50:00.000Z	n2diy	EnsignRedshirt	Standard Dapper install.
2007-01-19T11:51:00.000Z	n2diy	EnsignRedshirt	I'm at a login page, they want my user name and passmord
2007-01-19T11:51:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	n2diy	OK, thanks.  I'm using standard dapper too, so maybe something is screwed up in my configuration (even though ff still crashed in safe-mode).
2007-01-19T11:52:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	n2diy	Thanks again for checking.  Looks like I have to track down that problem with my config.
2007-01-19T11:52:00.000Z	n2diy	EnsignRedshirt	good luck, try the schools sys admin?
2007-01-19T11:54:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	n2diy	That will be my last resort... when I mention Linux to the sys admins there, they cover their eyes, or hold up crosses and garlic.
2007-01-19T11:55:00.000Z	n2diy	EnsignRedshirt	You mean they are running the system on something other the *unix?
2007-01-19T11:56:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	n2diy	I think they are all windows.
2007-01-19T11:57:00.000Z	n2diy	EnsignRedshirt	Wow, that is scary.
