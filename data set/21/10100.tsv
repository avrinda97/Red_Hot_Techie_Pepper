2005-06-22T07:34:00.000Z	gp_aaron		no one knows?
2005-06-22T07:35:00.000Z	gp_aaron		What is a gui cd-burning app for gnome that can handle bin/cue
2005-06-22T07:35:00.000Z	gp_aaron		well it doesn't need to be gnome just not k3b
2005-06-22T07:36:00.000Z	gp_aaron		do you know of a program that will let me burn a .avi to a vcd
2005-06-22T07:37:00.000Z	gp_aaron		ok
2005-06-22T07:38:00.000Z	gp_aaron		thank you
2005-06-22T07:38:00.000Z	Razor-X	gp_aaron	mpegh, what does it do?
2005-10-07T12:14:00.000Z	Razor-X	gp_aaron	*gasp*
2005-10-07T12:15:00.000Z	gp_aaron	Razor-X	I've used better that is all
2005-10-07T12:15:00.000Z	Razor-X	gp_aaron	in my experience, Gentoo portage is all that i've found that's better in some areas
2005-10-07T12:16:00.000Z	Razor-X	gp_aaron	hmmm, i've never used that
2005-10-07T12:16:00.000Z	Razor-X	gp_aaron	i'll give it a whirl
2005-10-07T12:17:00.000Z	gp_aaron	Razor-X	Archlinux, and Rubix
2005-10-07T12:17:00.000Z	Razor-X	gp_aaron	ahhh, I see
2005-10-07T12:17:00.000Z	gp_aaron	Razor-X	Just be warned that the arch installer isn't pretty
2005-10-07T12:18:00.000Z	Razor-X	gp_aaron	is it better than a Gentoo Stage 2?
2005-10-07T12:19:00.000Z	Razor-X	gp_aaron	oh, no, then it's nothing like a Gentoo stage 2
2005-10-07T12:19:00.000Z	gp_aaron	Razor-X	Ubuntu would have to completely revamped to use pacman
2005-10-07T12:20:00.000Z	Razor-X	gp_aaron	yeah, I guess
2005-10-07T12:22:00.000Z	gp_aaron	Razor-X	give arch a shot, http://archlinux.org/
2005-10-07T12:25:00.000Z	Razor-X	gp_aaron	I will, when I get the time
