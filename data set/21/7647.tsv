2006-08-15T07:17:00.000Z	MrWoo		hello
2006-08-15T07:19:00.000Z	MrWoo		i am currently using a 3500+ AMD, X1600XT radeon graphics card, belkin 54G wireless card, 120 western digital ata100 hard drive, will ubuntu play nice with these components if i install it?
2006-08-15T07:20:00.000Z	MrWoo		scrappy, well i don't really have that luxury, i'm sticking with the ati card
2006-08-15T07:20:00.000Z	rs31337	MrWoo	i did have issues with a belkin 54g once
2006-08-15T07:20:00.000Z	MrWoo		i was having some trouble with a copy of breezy badger a friend gave me\
2006-08-15T07:21:00.000Z	MrWoo	rs31337	like what?
2006-08-15T07:21:00.000Z	rs31337	MrWoo	well, i couldn't get ndiswrapper to work with it (using windows drivers)
2006-08-15T07:22:00.000Z	MrWoo	rs31337	i have no idea what ndiswrapper is
2006-08-15T07:23:00.000Z	rs31337	MrWoo	ah, well, a lot of wireless devices do not have open source drivers for Linux (yet) and instead are supported by using ndiswrapper, which is a program that allows you to use windows wireless drivers in linux
2006-08-15T07:23:00.000Z	MrWoo	rs31337	i c
2006-08-15T07:23:00.000Z	MrWoo	rs31337	were you ever able to get it to work?
2006-08-15T07:23:00.000Z	rs31337	MrWoo	you might have success with it though.  just expect to have to do a little reading
2006-08-15T07:24:00.000Z	rs31337	MrWoo	eh, i ended up returning it for a Netgear 54G card ;)
2006-08-15T07:24:00.000Z	MrWoo	rs31337	thats not very encouraging :-)
2006-08-15T07:24:00.000Z	rs31337	MrWoo	i know :(  i have seen many cases where the same card is revised two or three times, and each one has a different chipset
2006-08-15T07:24:00.000Z	rs31337	MrWoo	i very likely had a different card, even if it's the same spec and manufacturer
2006-08-15T07:25:00.000Z	MrWoo		rs31337
2006-08-15T07:25:00.000Z	MrWoo	rs31337	well i'm making it a dual boot config anyway
2006-08-15T07:25:00.000Z	MrWoo	rs31337	so i can always go back to my XP if anything goes wrong (actually thats what i'm doing right now, for some reason x server won't work)
2006-08-15T07:25:00.000Z	rs31337	MrWoo	good call; you might have no trouble getting it working, but if you do, at least then you won't be completely without connectivity
2006-08-15T07:26:00.000Z	rs31337	MrWoo	good luck.  i gotta go eat. ;D
