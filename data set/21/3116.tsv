2009-03-30T16:10:00.000Z	popey	Jess3	are you installing via wubi or did you boot off the cd?
2009-03-30T16:12:00.000Z	Jess3	popey	off a cd (desktop version)
2009-03-30T16:12:00.000Z	popey	Jess3	where do you see those messages appearing?
2009-03-30T16:14:00.000Z	Jess3	popey	all over my screen, its been on all night, same msgs (i assume its an enlarged version of the terminal)
2009-03-30T16:16:00.000Z	Jess3	popey	I googled it a bit, and other people report the same probelm when removing or inserting disks in their cd drives
2009-03-30T16:17:00.000Z	popey	Jess3	and i take it you didnt remove the disk?
2009-03-30T16:18:00.000Z	Jess3	popey	thats is correct, it is still in there
2009-03-30T16:26:00.000Z	Jess3	popey	No idea what it is/what I should do ?
2009-03-30T16:31:00.000Z	popey	Jess3	what is installed on the box already? xp or vista?
2009-03-30T16:32:00.000Z	popey	Jess3	how did you choose to partition the disk?
2009-03-30T16:32:00.000Z	Jess3	popey	how is this related to the other partitions ?
2009-03-30T16:33:00.000Z	popey	Jess3	because you're partitioning a disk that contains a vista partition which is not the same as an xp partition
2009-03-30T16:33:00.000Z	popey	Jess3	don't play with the bot pls.
2009-03-30T16:34:00.000Z	Jess3	popey	sorry, just wanted to see, not playing, and i am partitioning a 'new' piece of my hd
2009-03-30T16:34:00.000Z	popey	Jess3	did you resize the windows partition?
2009-03-30T16:35:00.000Z	Jess3	popey	yes, PM more convenient ?
2009-03-30T16:35:00.000Z	popey	Jess3	how did you resize the vista partition
2009-03-30T16:37:00.000Z	Jess3	popey	I used the auto partitioner in the CD
2009-03-30T16:38:00.000Z	Jess3	popey	I also did this with Hardy and vista, it worked fine then
2009-03-30T16:38:00.000Z	popey	Jess3	thats why i said I cant help, I have had no experience of installing ubuntu on a machine with vista installed resized
2009-03-30T16:39:00.000Z	Jess3	popey	anyone else who might know about it ?
