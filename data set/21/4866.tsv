2011-04-25T01:47:00.000Z	rww	rly	I am.
2011-04-25T01:41:00.000Z	rww	rly	Ringwaul: It was a known bug in Maverick's version of the Live installer. It's fixed in natty.
2011-04-25T01:41:00.000Z	rly	rww	I have another smallish issue with the 10.10 installer.
2011-04-25T01:41:00.000Z	rly	rww	basically you get I/O errors when you are done with the installer.
2011-04-25T01:41:00.000Z	rly	rww	the only way is to press the power button.
2011-04-25T01:41:00.000Z	rww	rly	also a known bug, though with the live environment rather than the installer.
2011-04-25T01:42:00.000Z	rly	rww	how do these bugs slip through?
2011-04-25T01:42:00.000Z	rly	rww	is it hardware specific?
2011-04-25T01:42:00.000Z	rww	rly	In the case of that one, it's not easy to fix. In the case of the one Ringwaul mentioned, not enough people testing installer images.
2011-04-25T01:43:00.000Z	rly	rww	why is it not easy to fix?
2011-04-25T01:43:00.000Z	rly	rww	what is the bug nr?
2011-04-25T01:43:00.000Z	rww	rly	I just said, I don't have it handy.
2011-04-25T01:46:00.000Z	rww	rly	That's not appropriate for this channel.
2011-04-25T01:46:00.000Z	rly	rww	guntbert: please try to follow the flow of conversation here.

2011-04-25T01:47:00.000Z	rww	rly	That looks like the one I was thinking of, yes.
2011-04-25T01:51:00.000Z	rly	rww	that issue has been known for 14 months.
2011-04-25T01:51:00.000Z	rly	rww	does anyone even work on Ubuntu?
2011-04-25T01:52:00.000Z	rly	rww	it should be a matter of a day of work at most to fix that.
2011-04-25T01:52:00.000Z	rww	rly	Please feel free to fix it, then.
2011-04-25T01:54:00.000Z	rww	rly	#ubuntu is for Ubuntu technical support. Try #ubuntu-offtopic.
