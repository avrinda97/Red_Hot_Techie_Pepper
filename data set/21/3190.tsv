2009-03-10T10:57:00.000Z	ash_gfm		 How can I get metrics, over time, on how much nautilus is ruining my ability to use my computer?
2009-03-10T10:57:00.000Z	ash_gfm		Thunar, ctrl-a selects all. Nautilus, ctrl-a 'I would like to select all files, please think about it for 5 or 6 minutes, and get back to me, you *$&*&$ idiot'
2009-03-10T10:57:00.000Z	ash_gfm		Is there anything I can do short of paying $100 to have the authors beaten up?
2009-03-10T10:57:00.000Z	raylu	ash_gfm	bash: what is select all?
2009-03-10T10:58:00.000Z	raylu	ash_gfm	you should just get rid of your gui
2009-03-10T10:58:00.000Z	raylu	ash_gfm	or, rather, keep it around for things like firefox and mplayer
2009-03-10T10:58:00.000Z	ash_gfm	raylu	I should, except I need thumbnails for sorting the images in the design folder. I use C-x-f but as I age, the ability to parse jpeg in my head diminishes
2009-03-10T10:58:00.000Z	raylu	ash_gfm	but not for things like nautilus
2009-03-10T10:59:00.000Z	ash_gfm	raylu	+1 for additional cuils
2009-03-10T10:59:00.000Z	ash_gfm	raylu	just curious, but what did you mean by ' but not for things like nautilus '
2009-03-10T10:59:00.000Z	raylu	ash_gfm	hrm. i suppose that's a valid excuse
2009-03-10T11:00:00.000Z	raylu	ash_gfm	as in do everything in bash except web-browsing and movie-watching
2009-03-10T11:00:00.000Z	ash_gfm	raylu	if you're not using links, and running all your movies through an ascii filter, you're doing it wrong.
2009-03-10T11:01:00.000Z	ash_gfm	raylu	so fail for you. but - what editor do you use?
2009-03-10T11:01:00.000Z	raylu	ash_gfm	vim
2009-03-10T11:01:00.000Z	ash_gfm	raylu	oh, fail. I can bench press 300lbs with my pinky.
2009-03-10T11:01:00.000Z	raylu	ash_gfm	explain?
2009-03-10T11:01:00.000Z	raylu	ash_gfm	heh. debian's vim developer recently switched to emacs
2009-03-10T11:04:00.000Z	raylu	ash_gfm	have you heard the joke: emacs is a great operating system but it lacks a good text editor?
2009-03-10T11:04:00.000Z	ash_gfm	raylu	I think I was out getting drunk and laying women when they told that one
2009-03-10T11:06:00.000Z	ash_gfm	raylu	I am using textmate now - I am finding more developer support on mac than linux, crazy
