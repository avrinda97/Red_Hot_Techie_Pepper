2012-10-14T16:05:00.000Z	sasuke		hi guys, can anyone tell me what is the requirement for 12.10 version
2012-10-14T16:05:00.000Z	bekks	sasuke	Requirement regarding what?
2012-10-14T16:06:00.000Z	sasuke	bekks	oh sry , system requirement ?
2012-10-14T18:07:00.000Z	bekks	sasuke	NO.
2012-10-14T18:07:00.000Z	bekks	sasuke	modprobe the pcspkr module.
2012-10-14T18:10:00.000Z	bekks	sasuke	Did you modprobe the module for your speaker?
2012-10-14T18:10:00.000Z	sasuke	bekks	 yes
2012-10-14T18:12:00.000Z	sasuke	bekks	i didnt get any output
2012-10-14T18:12:00.000Z	bekks	sasuke	Because modprobe does not produce output.
2012-10-14T18:12:00.000Z	bekks	sasuke	Check wether that module is loaded.
2012-10-14T18:13:00.000Z	bekks	sasuke	And read that section from the manpage VERY carefully, it states some security caveats when running the command above.
2012-10-14T18:14:00.000Z	sasuke	bekks	by the way how can we check the modules
2012-10-14T18:17:00.000Z	sasuke	bekks	i got this output "pcspkr                 12718  0 " when i use "lsmod | grep pcspkr" cmd
2012-10-20T13:22:00.000Z	bekks	sasuke	Why dont you just use virtualbox?
2012-10-20T13:25:00.000Z	sasuke	bekks	Jimster480-L , I am learning through some CBT videos. Everything they are doing on vmware, so probably i want to use it . Once i done i'll try out on virtual box. anyway "sh vmware...*.txt" cmd is working. I am installing that. thanks :)
2012-10-20T13:26:00.000Z	bekks	sasuke	Well, You CANNOT execute a TEXT file.
2012-10-20T13:28:00.000Z	sasuke	bekks	i am not sure. i downloaded "https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/details?downloadGroup=WKST-900-LX&productId=293&download=true&fileId=50028826&secureParam=4648a503eaac71f71cc4f2b69fa11269&downloadType=". as a txt file. i thought sh only executes *sh files, but "sh vmwar....*.txt" is working
2012-10-20T13:29:00.000Z	sasuke	bekks	its working .... installation done
2012-10-20T13:29:00.000Z	bekks	sasuke	sh executes executable files. a text file isnt executable. :)
2012-10-20T13:29:00.000Z	bekks	sasuke	And personally, I'd really not use vmware on linux.
2012-10-20T13:29:00.000Z	sasuke	bekks	:)
