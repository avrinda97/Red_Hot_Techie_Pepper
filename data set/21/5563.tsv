2007-09-27T11:27:00.000Z	volantares		hello. how's everyone today
2007-09-27T11:28:00.000Z	volantares		i downloaded the AMD64 version of ubuntu 7.04, yet when I try to install a 64-bit driver it says it isn't a 64-bit OS?
2007-09-27T11:28:00.000Z	MasterShrek	volantares	what kind of a driver are you installing?
2007-09-27T11:28:00.000Z	volantares	MasterShrek	a sound card driver
2007-09-27T11:29:00.000Z	volantares	MasterShrek	it's got an installer, but it spits it out when i run it
2007-09-27T13:42:00.000Z	MasterShrek	volantares	sudo sh NVIDIA...
2007-09-27T13:44:00.000Z	MasterShrek	volantares	you want to ctrl+alt+f1, kill gdm, install the driver, then restart gdm
2007-09-27T13:45:00.000Z	volantares	MasterShrek	what's gdm? (I'm new)
2007-09-27T14:11:00.000Z	volantares	MasterShrek	ok, so i'm back.. i tried to install the driver, and it checked for a header or something (forget exactly what), but it couldn't find one online, so it had to compile one.. anyway, it then said that i had to install the libc development package
2007-09-27T14:12:00.000Z	MasterShrek	volantares	i forgot that ubuntu doesnt come standard with compilers and stuff
2007-09-27T14:17:00.000Z	volantares	MasterShrek	success.. can you just post me that command again so i can write it down?
2007-09-27T14:17:00.000Z	MasterShrek	volantares	i have no idea what command i gave you lol
2007-09-27T14:17:00.000Z	volantares	MasterShrek	it was the one for getting the libc development package
2007-09-27T14:19:00.000Z	volantares	MasterShrek	ok, i have another question for you or whoever else. I am trying to install a 64-bit sound driver (SB XFi), and I am certain that I have installed the AMD64 version of ubuntu 7.04. anyway, the installer claims that I do not have a 64-bit OS.. what do you think is the cause/how do i fix it?
2007-09-27T14:20:00.000Z	MasterShrek	volantares	no idea, most sound drivers should be supported in the kernel
2007-09-27T14:20:00.000Z	volantares	MasterShrek	yeah, this is a new card and creative have just released a driver.
2007-09-27T14:23:00.000Z	volantares	MasterShrek	how do you set screen resolutions manually? Once i've installed this driver, it's decided that my resolutions aren't what they should be
2007-09-27T14:24:00.000Z	MasterShrek	volantares	i always put them in /etc/X11/xorg.conf (must be root to edit)
2007-09-27T14:34:00.000Z	MasterShrek	volantares	yes it is
2007-10-19T10:48:00.000Z	MasterShrek	volantares	can you disable splash screen?
2007-10-19T10:50:00.000Z	MasterShrek	volantares	hit f6 or something on that menu screen, check out different options, i think theres a way to disable splash
