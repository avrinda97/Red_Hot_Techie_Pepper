2004-12-13T16:26:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac		Hello again. Does anyone know anything about pbbuttonsd ???
2004-12-13T16:27:00.000Z	pitti	Felix_the_Mac	I run it for months now without any trouble
2004-12-13T16:27:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	pitti	Hi there. What system do you use?
2004-12-13T16:27:00.000Z	pitti	Felix_the_Mac	iBook G4 800
2004-12-13T16:28:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	pitti	Great! I hope you may be able to help me get track pad tapping working
2004-12-13T16:28:00.000Z	pitti	Felix_the_Mac	no problem
2004-12-13T16:29:00.000Z	pitti	Felix_the_Mac	install package "powerprefs" and enjoy the nice gui
2004-12-13T16:29:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	pitti	Basically, although pbbuttonsd is working and I have set tap on in powerprefs is doesnt work :-(
2004-12-13T16:29:00.000Z	pitti	Felix_the_Mac	However, be sure to start it as root ("sudo powerprefs") to allow it to actually write its conf file
2004-12-13T16:29:00.000Z	pitti	Felix_the_Mac	oh, works fine for me
2004-12-13T16:29:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	pitti	What I want is to tap to emulated right click.
2004-12-13T16:30:00.000Z	pitti	Felix_the_Mac	ugh, I don't think that this is possible
2004-12-13T16:30:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	pitti	Oh, so what are the tap settings in powerprefs for then ?
2004-12-13T16:30:00.000Z	pitti	Felix_the_Mac	well, just enable or disable it
2004-12-13T16:31:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	pitti	What does 'it' do when it is enabled?
2004-12-13T16:32:00.000Z	pitti	Felix_the_Mac	tapping the pad is equal to left mouse button
2004-12-13T16:32:00.000Z	pitti	Felix_the_Mac	you can also "drag" with it
2004-12-13T16:32:00.000Z	pitti	Felix_the_Mac	and IIRC you can emulate a scroll wheel
2004-12-13T16:33:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	pitti	Left !!!!!!   I assumed that since we Mac users are deficient in the right-mouse-button department it would do that!!
2004-12-13T16:33:00.000Z	pitti	Felix_the_Mac	well, you can emulate the right button with some keys
2004-12-13T16:34:00.000Z	pitti	Felix_the_Mac	Default are F11 and F12 for middle/right
