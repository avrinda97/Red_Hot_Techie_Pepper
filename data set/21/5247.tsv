2008-04-25T04:41:00.000Z	Datalanche		Hi. I just tried to do a fresh install of Hardy on my computer. I have two drives and two optical drives on my motherboards IDE controller, and three more hard drives on my Silicon Image-based PCI-IDE card. It is detecting the Sil-card's drive first(hda, hdb, and hdc). After the install, all I get is a screen full of "﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ..." What can I do to fix this?
2008-04-25T04:42:00.000Z	maco	Datalanche	did the install complete?
2008-04-25T04:42:00.000Z	Datalanche	maco	Yes, finished fine and I clicked restart.
2008-04-25T04:42:00.000Z	Datalanche	maco	In Gutsy, my onboard IDE drives were hda and hdb. Now they are all sdX
2008-04-25T04:43:00.000Z	maco	Datalanche	thats normal.thats a libata change
2008-04-25T04:43:00.000Z	maco	Datalanche	are any of the drives reporting themselves wrong to the bios?
2008-04-25T04:43:00.000Z	maco	Datalanche	i know there are issues with sata drives that tell the bios to pretende they're IDE
2008-04-25T04:43:00.000Z	Datalanche	maco	Nope, I watched them all pop up, they seem to be going in just fine. Oh, and also, they are IDE drives, not SATA
2008-04-25T04:44:00.000Z	maco	Datalanche	theyre *all* IDE? all more than 5?
2008-04-25T04:44:00.000Z	Datalanche	maco	Yes, I have five IDE hard drives.
2008-04-25T04:44:00.000Z	maco	Datalanche	you cant do that
2008-04-25T04:45:00.000Z	maco	Datalanche	i dont know how else to explain it but...5 IDEs just cant go
2008-04-25T04:45:00.000Z	maco	Datalanche	its a bug
2008-04-25T04:45:00.000Z	Datalanche	maco	Uh, yeah I can. I have two connect on the motherboard's IDE controller, and three on a PCI expansion card.
2008-04-25T04:45:00.000Z	maco	Datalanche	on ubuntu, 5 IDEs just cant go
2008-04-25T04:45:00.000Z	Datalanche	maco	It was working just fine in Gutsy
2008-04-25T04:46:00.000Z	maco	Datalanche	regression....its a known bug on hardy though
2008-04-25T04:48:00.000Z	maco	Datalanche	and in hardy it is a problem.  things changed and it got broken.  thats all there is to it
2008-04-25T04:49:00.000Z	maco	Datalanche	hopefully itll be fixed by 8.04.1 in june, but maybe it wont
2008-04-25T04:51:00.000Z	maco	Datalanche	stick to gutsy
2008-04-25T04:54:00.000Z	Datalanche	maco	I still think this is a grub and/or devmapping issue. I had this problem once before in Edgy or whenever they changed up the ATA a while back, and fixed it by installing Ubuntu on a drive on the PCI controller and it worked flawlessly. I guess I'll just have to scramble my drives and do it that way again... annoying as it is. >_>
