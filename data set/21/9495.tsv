2007-01-31T13:12:00.000Z	Flannel	illriginal	You still have web browsers, etc.  Basically, you've reduced the securityof the system to that of Windows.
2007-01-31T13:13:00.000Z	Flannel	illriginal	no, not reverting.  You'd just set them some other way.
2007-01-31T13:14:00.000Z	Flannel	illriginal	you can't.  Without just going through and setting them (and knowing what they were originally)
2007-02-11T14:25:00.000Z	Flannel	illriginal	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/MP3  you need to install k3b's mp3 codec,
2007-02-11T14:26:00.000Z	Flannel	illriginal	which one?  and which version of ubuntu are you running?
2007-02-11T14:29:00.000Z	Flannel	illriginal	what version of ubuntu are you running?
2008-02-13T08:37:00.000Z	Flannel	illriginal	Kompozer
2008-02-13T08:40:00.000Z	Flannel	illriginal	What version of Ubuntu are you running?
2008-02-13T08:40:00.000Z	Flannel	illriginal	You'll need to enable the backports repository
2008-02-13T08:41:00.000Z	Flannel	illriginal	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
2008-02-13T08:41:00.000Z	Flannel	illriginal	Kompozer was only added to the repos for Gutsy (and backported for Feisty), sicne its relatively new.  That's why you have to do a little bit extra (but not too much)
