2007-11-23T05:10:00.000Z	dtolj_	bodo	do you have the correct setup in boot/grub/menu.1st?
2007-11-23T05:12:00.000Z	bodo	dtolj_	bodo: do you have the correct setup in boot/grub/menu.1st?           dun know ??? iam new here
2007-11-23T05:14:00.000Z	dtolj_	bodo	edit this file /boot/grub/menu.1st and make sure you see your installed OS there and that its pointing to the correct partition, see more info on google.
2007-11-23T05:17:00.000Z	dtolj_	bodo	in that case do it from the grub menu, you have grub installed right?
2007-11-23T05:17:00.000Z	dtolj_	bodo	always create a grub boot disk!
2007-11-23T05:25:00.000Z	dtolj_	bodo	enter the grub prompt and type root (hd0,0) then find /boot/grub/menu.1st followed by setup (hd0)
2007-11-23T05:26:00.000Z	bodo	dtolj_	bodo: enter the grub prompt and type root (hd0,0) then find /boot/grub/menu.1st followed by setup (hd0)
2007-11-23T05:26:00.000Z	bodo	dtolj_	bodo: enter the grub prompt and type root (hd0,0) then find /boot/grub/menu.1st followed by setup (hd0) i've done that
2007-11-23T05:27:00.000Z	dtolj_	bodo	assuming your OS is installed on fist partition on first hd, then it will install the boot loader in at beggining of the drive
2007-11-23T05:47:00.000Z	dtolj_	bodo	you have to specify where Ubuntu is installed on which partition do you know? and then acordingly set the root (hd0,?)
2007-11-23T05:50:00.000Z	bodo	dtolj_	bodo: you have to specify where Ubuntu is installed on which partition do you know? and then acordingly set the root (hd0,?) yeah
2007-11-23T05:52:00.000Z	bodo	dtolj_	bodo: you have to specify where Ubuntu is installed on which partition do you know? and then acordingly set the root (hd0,?) yeah it's on 5 so i wrote root(hd0,4) and nothing new
2007-11-23T05:54:00.000Z	dtolj_	bodo	once you enter root (hd0,4) do you get a message with the file system type, that would indicate its the correct partition.
2007-11-23T05:55:00.000Z	bodo	dtolj_	bodo: once you enter root (hd0,4) do you get a message with the file system type, that would indicate its the correct partition.    i think so ...
2007-11-23T06:01:00.000Z	bodo	dtolj_	bodo: once you enter root (hd0,4) do you get a message with the file system type, that would indicate its the correct partition. yeah i do as i think
2007-11-23T06:02:00.000Z	dtolj_	bodo	still nothing?
2007-11-23T06:09:00.000Z	dtolj_	bodo	it should pick up the stage files from hd0,4 and put them in MBR
2007-11-23T06:10:00.000Z	bodo	dtolj_	bodo: it should pick up the stage files from hd0,4 and put them in MBR
2007-11-23T06:11:00.000Z	dtolj_	bodo	boot into cent, mount hd0,4 check what the entry for Ubuntu is, and copy it to the active boot partition
