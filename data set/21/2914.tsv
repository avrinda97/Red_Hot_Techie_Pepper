2009-05-17T13:45:00.000Z	NewApples		Which is the best antivirus program for Ubuntu?
2009-05-17T13:45:00.000Z	SiDi	NewApples	ClavAV has been here for a while... but i seriously doubt you need an antivirus
2009-05-17T13:46:00.000Z	NewApples	SiDi	yes i noticed ClavAV in the applications add/remove it is called Virus scanner do you mean that one ?
2009-05-17T13:46:00.000Z	NewApples	SiDi	I am the most paranoid person on the planet whenyou write that i think that  you are a hacker who wants to get mya ccount info...
2009-05-17T13:46:00.000Z	SiDi	NewApples	i meant that one. If you're paranoid at this stage, drop Linux and go for OpenBSD or FreeBSD ;)
2009-05-17T13:47:00.000Z	NewApples	SiDi	I am very paranoid but i am not computer wiz, this linux version is so far the only one that i atleast am able to use and understand i a limited fashion
2009-05-17T13:48:00.000Z	NewApples	SiDi	I only understand stocks, not computers
2009-05-17T13:48:00.000Z	SiDi	NewApples	There's DragonFlyBSD that is designed for desktop end users :p
2009-05-17T13:49:00.000Z	NewApples	SiDi	i spent this whole weekened trying to figure out Ubuntu linux i am way to lazy to figure out something else also there is a time factor, please just tell me the ebst anti virus for Ubuntu linux
2009-05-17T13:50:00.000Z	SiDi	NewApples	the best antivirus is to not grab packages from websites and to only use the official repository for updates
2009-05-17T13:51:00.000Z	SiDi	NewApples	i seriously think there is no _need_ of this :) just don't modify your system, don't grab ubuntu software from websites around, and you should be ok
2009-05-17T13:52:00.000Z	SiDi	NewApples	again, the best option is being careful. I don't think an antivirus software would help you at all. Usually they can recognise a virus _after_ it killed thousands of PCs, so i don't see the point
2009-05-17T13:56:00.000Z	SiDi	NewApples	use an LVN encrypted hard drive disk (you need the alternate install cd for that), don't share your username/password, don't store any passwords in 'seahorse', don't install ssh/ftp/apache/anything on your machine, don't accept any .py/.sh/.bin/.run file from the web, don't execute any file received by email (open them with their respective apps
2009-05-17T13:56:00.000Z	SiDi	NewApples	instead) and you'll be TOTALLY safe.
2009-05-17T13:57:00.000Z	NewApples	SiDi	what i did before is buy one laptop pc per week ONLY use it for tradeing then destroy it, but that is so wastefull so that is one of the reasons i came to linux
2009-05-17T13:57:00.000Z	SiDi	NewApples	wow, you should have sent me the old machines instead ;)
2009-05-17T13:59:00.000Z	SiDi	NewApples	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Security and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedFilesystems will give you more info
2009-05-17T13:59:00.000Z	SiDi	NewApples	you can also watch for current security issues here : http://www.ubuntu.com/usn
2009-05-17T14:00:00.000Z	SiDi	NewApples	you could aswell only destroy the HDD and _send me_ the rest of the machines :p
2009-05-17T14:01:00.000Z	NewApples	SiDi	no nothing was spared everything was destroyed I still do this I see it as a running cost, I make way more by trading then what the computers cost, think of it more as a cost to be able to trade
2009-05-17T14:02:00.000Z	SiDi	NewApples	as a geek i still find it scandalous to destroy PCs :) if you wipe them out and give them to linux user groups they can use the hardware to make better drivers for instance :p
