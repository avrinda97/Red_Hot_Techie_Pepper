2005-12-21T06:37:00.000Z	WebLOCH		Any takes for an apache2/php4 configuration problem ?
2005-12-21T06:39:00.000Z	daemon	WebLOCH	i could give it a shot :)
2005-12-21T06:42:00.000Z	WebLOCH	daemon	cheers for offering, you mind moving to a PM to continue ?
2005-12-21T06:43:00.000Z	daemon	WebLOCH	np
2005-12-21T06:47:00.000Z	WebLOCH	daemon	can you see the PM ?
2005-12-21T06:53:00.000Z	daemon	WebLOCH	I see it, and Im talking there....
2005-12-21T06:54:00.000Z	WebLOCH	daemon	okay, im not getting any messages, unless you mean you WILL be talking there?
2005-12-21T06:54:00.000Z	daemon	WebLOCH	Ive been saying stuff... weird...
2005-12-21T06:56:00.000Z	WebLOCH	daemon	would you mind repeating here then ?
2005-12-21T06:56:00.000Z	daemon	WebLOCH	never done this myself, but on my gentoo-box I have a file named 70_mod_php.conf witch looks promesing....
2005-12-21T06:57:00.000Z	WebLOCH	daemon	ahh ive looked through the confs and nothing seems out of place, I assume I have to edit an apache conf but everyone claims it works out of the box
2005-12-21T06:58:00.000Z	daemon	WebLOCH	i dont think it does... try the extension .phtml
2005-12-21T06:59:00.000Z	WebLOCH	daemon	are all HTML files containing PHP meant to be renamed to '.phtml' ?
2005-12-21T07:00:00.000Z	daemon	WebLOCH	dunno, I always use .php... but somwhere in your apache config files, not necesarily the main one, there is a line like this one:
2005-12-21T07:00:00.000Z	daemon	WebLOCH	AddType application/x-httpd-php .phtml
2005-12-21T07:00:00.000Z	daemon	WebLOCH	which makes it work....
2005-12-21T07:02:00.000Z	WebLOCH	daemon	the phtml worked already
2005-12-21T07:03:00.000Z	WebLOCH	daemon	what im saying is, if i have a file thats predominantly HTML, i thought convention was to name it .html
2005-12-21T07:03:00.000Z	daemon	WebLOCH	if it contains a slight amount of php I always call it .php, since its processed before it's sent...
2005-12-21T07:04:00.000Z	WebLOCH	daemon	i guess that makes sense, i feel very silly, thanks for correcting me haha, dont suppose you woudl care to explain the sites configs to me ?
2005-12-21T07:05:00.000Z	daemon	WebLOCH	you mean virtual hosts?
