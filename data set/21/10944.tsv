2006-04-20T09:35:00.000Z	SusPec1		i still dont understand how to install a rpm file
2006-04-20T09:36:00.000Z	SusPec1		and i dont know how to open the files i installed with wine
2006-04-20T09:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 use alien, convert it to a deb, dpkg -i whatever.deb
2006-04-20T09:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 wine /home/username/.fake_windows/program files/program.exe :P
2006-04-20T09:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 now is where you 'think'  and look and see what dirs are there and use the right paths
2006-04-20T09:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 wine uses some 'directory' thats its own little windows type dir.  cd  into it, and see whates there.
2006-04-20T09:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 'ls -al' will show all the dirs. incoudien the hidden ones.
2006-04-20T09:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 thats just sick :P using IE.
2006-04-20T09:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 'ls -al' will show all the dirs. including. the hidden ones.
2006-04-20T09:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	  Yes i hear you can.
2006-04-20T09:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 no clue. I wouldent EVER want to do such a thing.
2006-04-20T09:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 theres not. :P  he just asked Faq #1
2006-04-20T09:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 i would guess ya download the insteller and wine installer.exe Like ya do everything else.
2006-04-20T09:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 ive neer heard of a 'windows' command or 'user'  no clue where thats comming from of what you are even trying to do.
2006-04-20T09:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 'think' :P
2006-04-20T09:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 GO to the MS site.. download the IE installer and run it with wine.
2006-04-20T09:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 you have been running files that way 'ls' for example
2006-04-20T09:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 you have been shown several examples and need to pay attention is bottom line.
2006-04-20T10:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 No.
2006-04-20T10:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SusPec1	 you may just want to use 'gaim' and be done with it.
