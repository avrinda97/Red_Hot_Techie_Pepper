2008-06-08T08:37:00.000Z	asc		I'm using 8.04 on a gateway/router thing, and it is restarting after precisely one hour for no apparent reason. Anybody know why this might be?
2008-06-08T08:37:00.000Z	asc		Yeah, I checked for rootkits, temperature and memory problems
2008-06-08T08:38:00.000Z	asc		Gun: A computer, such as would be capable of running ubuntu and also acting as a gateway and/or router
2008-06-08T08:38:00.000Z	asc		Yes.
2008-06-08T08:39:00.000Z	asc		Wait. It takes one hour, but is not at the hour.
2008-06-08T08:39:00.000Z	asc		Gun: Yes.
2008-06-08T08:40:00.000Z	asc		Looking.
2008-06-08T08:40:00.000Z	askvictor	asc	is it _exactly_ one hour?
2008-06-08T08:43:00.000Z	askvictor	asc	I'd try getting as much logging happening as possible... are you logging the temperature of the CPU and HDs?
2008-06-08T08:43:00.000Z	askvictor	asc	cpu load?
2008-06-08T08:43:00.000Z	asc	askvictor	I've been watching them. CPU temperature and RAM use is fine. The boot drive's temperature is high, but I'm pretty sure that's a sensor problems. It's never caused and problems before.
2008-06-08T08:44:00.000Z	askvictor	asc	or you could try disabling as many services as possible and slowing re-enable them... but it might take a while...
2008-06-08T08:45:00.000Z	asc	askvictor	Any word on which services will make it dies when you disable them?
2008-06-08T08:46:00.000Z	askvictor	asc	perhaps try booting into recovery mode and wait an hour to see if it's a service or the basic system.
2008-06-08T08:47:00.000Z	asc	askvictor	Aight. Thanks.
2008-06-08T08:48:00.000Z	askvictor	asc	or you could add a little logging script to write every minute or two what processes are running and how much memory/cpu each is using?
2008-06-08T08:50:00.000Z	asc	askvictor	I'm just watching it on Conky. 1-2% CPU and 7% ram use. :p
2008-06-08T08:51:00.000Z	askvictor	asc	or if you're sure it's that regular, you could try changing the system time to jump forward to the next expected crash - that way you can see if it's based on actual time or something else which builds up (disk space, memory, temperature...) that seems to take an hour
2008-06-08T08:53:00.000Z	asc	askvictor	I'm pretty sure it was an hour. The last entry before the reboot was uptimed moving it up to rank X at 59:52 or something.
2008-06-08T08:53:00.000Z	asc	askvictor	But anyway. These are things that I will try.
2008-06-08T08:55:00.000Z	askvictor	asc	I hate debugging things that take a while to occur... but at least it's regular and not just random :)
