2007-01-22T12:47:00.000Z	mtyhome	jontec	but wifi-radar only serves wifi lans, while i need a sleek applet
2007-01-22T12:48:00.000Z	jontec	mtyhome	ubuntu doesn't have a gui? sleek applet?
2007-01-22T12:48:00.000Z	jontec	mtyhome	what do you need it to do?
2007-01-22T12:48:00.000Z	mtyhome	jontec	to manage networking
2007-01-22T12:49:00.000Z	mtyhome	jontec	just like nm-applet
2007-01-22T12:49:00.000Z	jontec	mtyhome	more specific, please :D
2007-01-22T12:49:00.000Z	mtyhome	jontec	wifi, vpn, wired, all with a simple and fast gui
2007-01-22T12:50:00.000Z	jontec	mtyhome	oooh... I'm not sure if we have one of those... is nm-applet for windows or another distro?
2007-01-22T12:50:00.000Z	mtyhome	jontec	what are you talking about ? of course it runs under ubuntu fine
2007-01-22T12:51:00.000Z	jontec	mtyhome	okay, then what's the problem? I'm not seeing your question here
2007-01-22T12:54:00.000Z	jontec	mtyhome	I think we've gone a bit over my level :D I've never used nm before and I've only a small amount of experience with iwconfig... :( sorry

2007-01-22T12:55:00.000Z	jontec	mtyhome	wasn't directed at you... was directed to the channel... :D I was asking them to answer your question. :D
