2007-09-14T13:19:00.000Z	upgrayedd		can somebody hold my hand for a minute? Im not sure if my g3dlibs are installing correctly.. the instructions at http://g3d-cpp.sourceforge.net/manual/guideunix.html .. everything builds without error except for one tiny thing... When i look to /usr/local I dont see a /G3D-7.00/ directory.. its like the Install path didnt work...
2007-09-14T13:20:00.000Z	|brad|	upgrayedd	when you ./configure it ... you need to set the prefix=/where/you/want it to go
2007-09-14T13:20:00.000Z	|brad|	upgrayedd	do a ./configure --help and read the options
2007-09-14T13:20:00.000Z	|brad|	upgrayedd	probably at the top
2007-09-14T13:21:00.000Z	|brad|	upgrayedd	i didnt look at the instructios but thats how it is normally when i compile something
2007-09-14T13:23:00.000Z	|brad|	upgrayedd	im gonna read the install and see what it says
2007-09-14T13:27:00.000Z	|brad|	upgrayedd	so when you do that ./buildg3d command it doesnt work? does it output any errors?
2007-09-14T13:31:00.000Z	|brad|	upgrayedd	apt-get install javacc ??
