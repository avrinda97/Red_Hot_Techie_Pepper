2009-01-02T06:31:00.000Z	yoyit2		**Gparted
2009-01-02T06:32:00.000Z	Gnea	yoyit2	sudo apt-get install gparted
2009-01-02T06:51:00.000Z	Gnea	yoyit2	you may wish to present your problem to the #vbox channel for more detailed help
2009-01-02T06:56:00.000Z	Gnea	yoyit2	what is root.disk? /?
2009-01-02T06:57:00.000Z	yoyit2	Gnea	its in host/ubuntu/disks
2009-01-02T06:57:00.000Z	Gnea	yoyit2	so, by 'installed thru vista', you mean you used wubi?
2009-01-02T06:57:00.000Z	yoyit2	Gnea	sure
2009-01-02T06:58:00.000Z	Gnea	yoyit2	not a good move. when you install via wubi, you're installing to a filesystem contained within a file on vista's filesystem. by getting rid of vista, you have now trapped your ubuntu installation.
2009-01-02T06:59:00.000Z	yoyit2	Gnea	but is there now ANY way to expand it to the entire hdd, rather then just 8.4GBs??
2009-01-02T06:59:00.000Z	Gnea	yoyit2	if vista was installed, sure
2009-01-02T07:00:00.000Z	Gnea	yoyit2	if you've got an ubuntu cd, you can install that
2009-01-02T07:01:00.000Z	yoyit2	Gnea	ok, but would i have to REINSTALL ubuntu? or could i just edit the file "root.disk"??
2009-01-02T07:01:00.000Z	Gnea	yoyit2	yeah, reinstall, from the ground-up.
2009-01-02T07:02:00.000Z	yoyit2	Gnea	friggen retarded!!
2009-01-02T07:02:00.000Z	Gnea	yoyit2	i know, vista surely is.
2009-01-02T07:03:00.000Z	yoyit2	Gnea	is there any way to Copy/paste all the drivers and programs from the ubuntu im using now, to the one i reinstall?
2009-01-02T07:03:00.000Z	Gnea	yoyit2	i'm not sure... you'd have to load up the livecd and see if it finds it or not
2009-01-02T07:04:00.000Z	yoyit2	Gnea	arg!
2009-01-02T07:04:00.000Z	yoyit2	Gnea	 there arnt any ways of using an ubuntu program to do it? or a live vista disc?
2009-01-02T07:05:00.000Z	Gnea	yoyit2	realistically speaking, at this conjuncture, your only recourse is to backup any important file you have on your ubuntu installation to a USB drive or CD, then just do a flat-out reinstall of ubuntu from CD or DVD.
