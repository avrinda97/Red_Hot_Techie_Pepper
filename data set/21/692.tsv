2011-08-01T07:30:00.000Z	ldr	PsyCl0ne	in one sentence: mount -t cifs \\AdressoftheWindowsBox\Sharename <mountpoint>
2011-08-01T07:31:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	ldr	unomi: Thank you both :)
2011-08-01T07:44:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	ldr	when you gave me this command "mount -t cifs \\AdressoftheWindowsBox\Sharename <mountpoint>" what exactly is the mount point?
2011-08-01T07:44:00.000Z	ldr	PsyCl0ne	whatever you want it to be
2011-08-01T07:44:00.000Z	ldr	PsyCl0ne	make some folder like mkdir /mnt/windows1
2011-08-01T07:46:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	ldr	Oh thank you.
2011-08-01T07:58:00.000Z	ldr	PsyCl0ne	y mistake you have to use // instead of \\
2011-08-01T07:59:00.000Z	ldr	PsyCl0ne	in windows you use \\ in linux you use // my mistake as i said
2011-08-01T08:19:00.000Z	ldr	PsyCl0ne	how to you want to access it? through ssh i thought this should be possible now
2011-08-01T08:21:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	ldr	I dont know what you mean exactly, Im speaking to you through the ssh server and the shares still dont show up
2011-08-01T08:47:00.000Z	ldr	PsyCl0ne	have a look at this file /etc/security/limits.conf
2011-08-01T08:48:00.000Z	ldr	PsyCl0ne	 it normally limits the parallel connections
2011-08-01T08:51:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	ldr	in this file I do not see a max parallel connections option
2011-08-01T08:51:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	ldr	would you like a pastebin of it??
2011-08-01T08:52:00.000Z	ldr	PsyCl0ne	no their normally is no limitation set
2011-08-01T08:52:00.000Z	ldr	PsyCl0ne	maybe you just didnt have one
2011-08-01T08:52:00.000Z	ldr	PsyCl0ne	you can in theory limit it through iptables too, but i dont think you did that either
2011-08-01T08:56:00.000Z	PsyCl0ne	ldr	I cant find a limit on connection in that file either
2011-08-01T08:57:00.000Z	ldr	PsyCl0ne	then just put "*         hard    maxlogins       10" in the file limits.conf
2011-08-01T08:57:00.000Z	ldr	PsyCl0ne	should raise the limit to 10
2011-08-01T08:58:00.000Z	ldr	PsyCl0ne	if Gasseus is right with his normally limit is 3
