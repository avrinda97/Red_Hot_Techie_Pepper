2008-10-23T11:22:00.000Z	histo	node357	yeah just like virtualbox. I Prefer using virtualbox because its ose
2008-12-09T10:19:00.000Z	histo	node357	you can reconfigure gnome-applets and use that to control scaling
2008-12-09T10:19:00.000Z	histo	node357	sudo dpkg-reconfigure gnome-applets when it asks you should the selecter get root priveleges tell it yes.
2008-12-09T10:20:00.000Z	histo	node357	then you can add the frequency scaler to your panel and adjust all sorts of options.

2008-12-09T10:22:00.000Z	histo	node357	at the cost of battery
2008-12-09T10:23:00.000Z	node357	histo	this is a desktop machine so it's good... but I can see how the scaling would be great for a laptop
2008-12-09T10:23:00.000Z	node357	histo	anyway I'll shut up now. thanks for the help !
2008-12-09T10:24:00.000Z	histo	node357	yeap.  You might want to disable it completely then if its a desktop machine some searching on the forums will show you how.

2008-12-23T13:54:00.000Z	histo	node357	but why you want to compile it is beyond me you can just sudo aptitude install wine
2008-12-23T13:54:00.000Z	histo	node357	or you can add their repo to your sources.list to get a up to date version.
2008-12-23T13:54:00.000Z	node357	histo	my app is not working in 1.01. and #winehq said install latest development version
2008-12-23T13:55:00.000Z	histo	node357	sudo aptitude update
