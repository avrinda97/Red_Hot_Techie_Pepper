2010-08-28T13:52:00.000Z	Baram		/etc/network/interfaces says auth eth0 (NOT commented out), and then #iface eth0 inet dhcp... is that correct?
2010-08-28T13:52:00.000Z	Gnea	Baram	why are you using /etc/network/interfaces?
2010-08-28T13:53:00.000Z	Gnea	Baram	why?
2010-08-28T13:53:00.000Z	Baram	Gnea	I thought everything in there should be commented out or blank
2010-08-28T13:53:00.000Z	Baram	Gnea	Can only get (unstable) connection via dhclient eth0, network-manager (wired) no longer functions.  9.10 64b, recently updated with kernel 2.6.32-24 (from ubuntu repos)
2010-08-28T13:54:00.000Z	Gnea	Baram	you'll need to delete the lines, not comment them
2010-08-28T13:54:00.000Z	Gnea	Baram	and I recommend you install wicd
2010-08-28T13:54:00.000Z	Baram	Gnea	Odd, I didn't put them in there in the first place
2010-08-28T13:54:00.000Z	Baram	Gnea	wicd requires removing network-manager, doesn't it?
2010-08-28T13:54:00.000Z	Gnea	Baram	this is my interfaces file:
2010-08-28T13:55:00.000Z	Gnea	Baram	of course it does
2010-08-28T13:56:00.000Z	Baram	Gnea	That didn't do it...
2010-08-28T13:56:00.000Z	Baram	Gnea	I'll try wicd... odd that I've never had an issue with network-manager
2010-08-28T14:02:00.000Z	Baram	Gnea	Ok... installed wicd
2010-08-28T14:02:00.000Z	Gnea	Baram	ok, should be able to access it from the top panel bar, or like this: wicd-client -n
2010-08-28T14:03:00.000Z	Baram	Gnea	I have it open and it seems to work... now how do I get it to show a tray icon?
2010-08-28T14:03:00.000Z	Baram	Gnea	Will do, brb
2010-08-28T14:05:00.000Z	Baram	Gnea	That seems to have worked
2010-08-28T14:05:00.000Z	Baram	Gnea	Thanks
2010-08-28T14:05:00.000Z	Gnea	Baram	cheers
2010-08-28T14:05:00.000Z	Gnea	Baram	I've had great success with wired and wifi with wicd. the thing that sucks is that wicd is in Ubuntu is still 1.x, while the 2.0 is in development mode right now, 2.0 is going to have a lot more functionality and features. Looking forward to its release.
