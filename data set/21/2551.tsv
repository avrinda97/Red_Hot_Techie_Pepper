2010-08-04T19:42:00.000Z	saymoo		why is ubuntu 10.04 broken?
2010-08-04T19:42:00.000Z	saymoo		and not fixed (iso)
2010-08-04T19:42:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	broken in what way?
2010-08-04T19:42:00.000Z	saymoo	StuckMojo	fresh install gives thousands of people a blank screen. (during first boot after install)
2010-08-04T19:43:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	it's doing that to me right now, before the install
2010-08-04T19:44:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	it happens. X doesn't play will with all video cards
2010-08-04T19:45:00.000Z	saymoo	StuckMojo	well, all previous versions of ubuntu works fine here, and at my work.
2010-08-04T19:45:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	so? you were lucky :)
2010-08-04T19:45:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	why don't you report a bug?
2010-08-04T19:45:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	and thus help fix it
2010-08-04T19:46:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	i'd guess it's related to X/video chipset
2010-08-04T19:47:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	so don't boot into X
2010-08-04T19:47:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	and try some different video drivers
2010-08-04T19:47:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	see if you can figure it out
2010-08-04T19:47:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	you don't even get a grub menu?
2010-08-04T19:48:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	you're saying you get a blank screen before the kernel even boots?
2010-08-04T19:49:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	the fact that you get it when grub loads is saying something
2010-08-04T19:49:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	probably grub is setting a video mode that's hosing the controller
2010-08-04T19:51:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	try the next release
2010-08-04T19:51:00.000Z	StuckMojo	saymoo	just to see what happens
2010-08-04T19:52:00.000Z	saymoo	StuckMojo	yes, because sooner or later, the koala is put to sleep, by closing it's repositories... and then i might have a working other release, or i'm doomed
