2007-06-16T11:26:00.000Z	littlesniper	Scunizi	hmm how do I build a ubuntu package once ive built the source package ? :-/
2007-06-16T11:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	littlesniper	not sure.. that's a compile question.. I'm not good at compiling.
2007-06-16T11:27:00.000Z	littlesniper	Scunizi	i did build the sources from the apt-get source, but now...
2007-06-16T11:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	littlesniper	sorry.. out of my debth
2007-06-16T11:28:00.000Z	littlesniper	Scunizi	damn its nasty to change of package manager
2007-06-16T11:31:00.000Z	littlesniper	Scunizi	:) I know perfectly well how to build from sources man. My question is how should i "repack" the sources I got from apt-get source and already built
2007-06-16T11:31:00.000Z	littlesniper	Scunizi	clearly how do I make a package once I got the things built
2007-06-16T11:31:00.000Z	littlesniper	Scunizi	not really a .deb user
2007-06-16T11:33:00.000Z	littlesniper	Scunizi	baaah what is this way to build... apt-get source --build
