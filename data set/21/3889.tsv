2008-08-26T14:12:00.000Z	execute		I need to benchmark something like cat foo | egrep ... | sed | awk | ...., how can I do that ?
2008-08-26T14:13:00.000Z	ikonia	execute	use "time" it will be rough but a good idea
2008-08-26T14:13:00.000Z	execute	ikonia	I looked at time manual, I couldnt find out how I should do that
2008-08-26T14:13:00.000Z	ikonia	execute	just put time in front of it
2008-08-26T14:14:00.000Z	ikonia	execute	time ls
2008-08-26T14:14:00.000Z	ikonia	execute	for example
2008-08-26T14:15:00.000Z	ikonia	execute	what ?
2008-08-26T14:15:00.000Z	ikonia	execute	you just put time in front of the comment
2008-08-26T14:15:00.000Z	ikonia	execute	ahhh I see what your saying
2008-08-26T14:16:00.000Z	ikonia	execute	you need to quote it -
2008-08-26T14:16:00.000Z	ikonia	execute	I see what your saying
2008-08-26T14:16:00.000Z	execute	ikonia	quating did the trick
2008-08-26T14:19:00.000Z	ikonia	execute	time `your command | next command | next -i command | and another`
2008-08-26T14:21:00.000Z	ikonia	execute	make sure your using back ticks
2008-08-26T14:22:00.000Z	ikonia	execute	ahhh I see it's picking up additional output
2008-08-26T14:22:00.000Z	ikonia	execute	yes, I see what your saying
2008-08-26T14:23:00.000Z	execute	ikonia	any ideas ?
2008-08-26T14:23:00.000Z	ikonia	execute	just thinking
2008-08-26T14:25:00.000Z	ikonia	execute	try time (commands | command)
2008-08-26T14:28:00.000Z	execute	ikonia	it works, thanks a lot!
