2010-08-15T07:48:00.000Z	blueicevirus	headkase314	i just learned empathy has irc chat  yay
2010-08-15T07:52:00.000Z	headkase314	blueicevirus	so how goes the flash struggle with a different browser?
2010-08-15T07:53:00.000Z	headkase314	blueicevirus	for ff you will need to install "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras"
2010-08-15T07:53:00.000Z	headkase314	blueicevirus	to get flash in ff
2010-08-15T07:54:00.000Z	headkase314	blueicevirus	I use chrome but the big contenders on Ubuntu are ff, chromium (open source Chrome), and Opera
2010-08-15T08:00:00.000Z	headkase314	blueicevirus	what kind of bz2 file? Source code, icons, window frames?
2010-08-15T08:01:00.000Z	blueicevirus	headkase314	glad your back. i downloaded firefox and it gave me a bz2 file
2010-08-15T08:02:00.000Z	headkase314	blueicevirus	oops saw ff after ;) ff should be installed by default with Ubuntu.  There are ppa's for later versions but really do not recommend them - you should stay with the default install.
2010-08-15T08:02:00.000Z	headkase314	blueicevirus	Should be under: Applications > Internet > Firefox
2010-08-15T08:03:00.000Z	headkase314	blueicevirus	be warned if you install the ppa it could break on a bad update and you'll have to wait for the next update to hopefully fix it.
2010-08-15T08:05:00.000Z	blueicevirus	headkase314	?
2010-08-15T08:06:00.000Z	headkase314	blueicevirus	specify ?
2010-08-15T08:07:00.000Z	blueicevirus	headkase314	well back to square one with sound, Im not getting sound from ff or chrome
2010-08-15T08:08:00.000Z	headkase314	blueicevirus	I think if you want to stick with Ubuntu the best thing you can do is crack open the case pull out the x-fi and put in any old generic sound card.  I really think that would be the solution to the woes.
2010-08-15T08:09:00.000Z	headkase314	blueicevirus	just responded to the pm you sent - I don't know how long it was there unnoticed!  Shouldn't really pm, see this next line:
