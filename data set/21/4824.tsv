2008-02-10T23:01:00.000Z	cvega		stupid question - does alternate ubuntu install cd have an utility to resize an ntfs partition?
2008-02-10T23:01:00.000Z	cvega		or is it only livecd
2008-02-10T23:01:00.000Z	cvega		the gparted livecd?
2008-02-10T23:01:00.000Z	cvega		and then use alternate?
2008-02-10T23:01:00.000Z	cvega		livecd takes forever for some reason.
2008-02-10T23:01:00.000Z	cvega		even with 2gb ram
2008-02-10T23:02:00.000Z	cvega		how reliable is gparted
2008-02-10T23:02:00.000Z	cvega		i have backups, but still would hate to loose my windows data.
2008-02-10T23:03:00.000Z	cvega		i want to squeeze ubuntu onto my laptop in dualboot with exsiting windows installation
2008-02-10T23:03:00.000Z	cvega		is gparted what i need?
2008-02-10T23:03:00.000Z	amenado	cvega	if I were you, i would verify your backup first before doing anything else :)
2008-02-10T23:03:00.000Z	cvega		80gb
2008-02-10T23:03:00.000Z	cvega		with 40gb free...
2008-02-10T23:03:00.000Z	amenado		cvega-> lots of people find out, that their back up was no good to begin with. so verify first
2008-02-10T23:04:00.000Z	cvega		backup is fine.. just did it.
2008-02-10T23:04:00.000Z	amenado		then use gparted
2008-02-10T23:04:00.000Z	cvega		20gb?
2008-02-10T23:04:00.000Z	amenado	cvega	doing a backup and verification are two different steps..just giving you a heads up
2008-02-10T23:04:00.000Z	cvega	ubuntu	wont have a problem with /boot being over 1024 ?
2008-02-10T23:04:00.000Z	cvega		over the 1024th block that is
2008-02-10T23:05:00.000Z	amenado	cvega	i have /boot in different drives..so i assume nope
