2012-04-30T05:06:00.000Z	DasEi	jdhfr	what's the exact error you get ? tried a full update / reconfiguring x ?
2012-04-30T05:17:00.000Z	DasEi	jdhfr	try sudo dpkg-reconfigure gnome
2012-04-30T05:17:00.000Z	DasEi	jdhfr	try sudo dpkg-reconfigure gnome-shell*
2012-04-30T05:17:00.000Z	DasEi	jdhfr	else full update and, after backup, a new xorg.conf
2012-04-30T05:35:00.000Z	DasEi	jdhfr	tried suggested solutions ?
2012-04-30T05:36:00.000Z	DasEi	jdhfr	boot safemode, update, -f install, reconfiguring shell, xorg.conf ?
2012-04-30T05:37:00.000Z	DasEi	jdhfr	the box in reach ? reboot it, press left ctrl at grub-time
2012-04-30T05:37:00.000Z	DasEi	jdhfr	boot to safemode so you get a commandline
2012-04-30T05:38:00.000Z	jdhfr	DasEi	I don' t have 'safemode' entry, which parameters to mean and why?
2012-04-30T05:39:00.000Z	DasEi	jdhfr	can also edit the common entry and add single to it
2012-04-30T05:40:00.000Z	jdhfr	DasEi	what for?
2012-04-30T05:40:00.000Z	DasEi	jdhfr	I won't repeat my suggestions again ^
2012-04-30T05:41:00.000Z	DasEi	jdhfr	you tried them already ?
2012-04-30T06:10:00.000Z	DasEi	jdhfr	there is no such as a registry in *nix
2012-04-30T06:22:00.000Z	DasEi	jdhfr	not really, but some patience, own research and following instructions makes it work
2012-04-30T06:41:00.000Z	DasEi	jdhfr	have a tea for now and come back later ?
