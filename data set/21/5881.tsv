2007-10-30T05:22:00.000Z	crdlb	MilitantPotato	that's the wrong way to do it
2007-10-30T05:22:00.000Z	crdlb	MilitantPotato	use ~/.config/compiz/compiz-manager instead
2007-10-30T05:23:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	crdlb	ah, I'm sorry.
2007-10-30T05:23:00.000Z	crdlb	MilitantPotato	no sudo :)

2007-10-30T05:24:00.000Z	crdlb	MilitantPotato	yes it will
2007-10-30T05:24:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	crdlb	really...so don't sudo ~/ things?

2007-11-20T07:02:00.000Z	crdlb	MilitantPotato	ls -l
2007-11-20T07:03:00.000Z	crdlb	MilitantPotato	you could safely chown the whole directory
2007-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	crdlb	what's the difference between SID and Lenny?
2007-11-20T07:30:00.000Z	crdlb	MilitantPotato	sid is unstable and lenny is testing, it takes packages a few weeks of testing to get from sid to lenny
2007-11-20T07:30:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	crdlb	thanks :)
2007-11-20T07:34:00.000Z	crdlb	MilitantPotato	why are you having him do this?
