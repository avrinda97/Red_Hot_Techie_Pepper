2012-07-14T02:02:00.000Z	urlwolf		using kubuntu, networkmanager fails to connect to my howe network.
2012-07-14T02:02:00.000Z	urlwolf		looking at /var/sys/log...
2012-07-14T02:03:00.000Z	urlwolf		using WPA personal. The password is correct
2012-07-14T02:03:00.000Z	urlwolf		is there a known bug?
2012-07-14T02:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	urlwolf	 check the bug reports yet?  ive heard of issues with some wirless cards/drivers and some auth methods.
2012-07-14T02:04:00.000Z	urlwolf		where are the bug reports?
2012-07-14T02:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis		!bugs
2012-07-14T02:05:00.000Z	urlwolf		I'm using whatever comes with kde by default
2012-07-14T02:05:00.000Z	urlwolf		just installed network-manager-kde
2012-07-14T02:08:00.000Z	urlwolf		about network-manager-kde, muon says "his is a dummy transitional package for plasma-widget-networkmanagement. You may safely remove it."
2012-07-14T02:09:00.000Z	Dr_willis		KDE is moving towards Sub-atomic partical names now? ;P
2012-07-14T02:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis		what sort of authencation does the office use? WPA personal also?
2012-07-14T02:12:00.000Z	urlwolf		nope, WPA enterprise
2012-07-14T02:13:00.000Z	urlwolf		the support guys told me there was a long-standing bug in WPA personal
2012-07-14T02:14:00.000Z	urlwolf		the solution was to use WPA enterprise, but I cannot use WPA enterprise at home
2012-07-14T02:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis		you got a low end home router that cant do  it?
2012-07-14T02:15:00.000Z	urlwolf	Dr_willis	alice router WLAN 1421
2012-07-14T02:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis		that name means nothing to me. :)
2012-07-14T02:16:00.000Z	urlwolf		it worked before
2012-07-14T02:17:00.000Z	urlwolf		might be the unconventional kernel (ubuntu 12.04 is 3.3.0 I think)
2012-07-14T02:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	urlwolf	 might be worth testing in a 12.10 live cd(beta) to see if it works there.
