2008-07-04T03:26:00.000Z	Forest		I'm having some trouble installing java in firefox 3--Hardy Heron, 8.04
2008-07-04T03:26:00.000Z	tomd123	Forest	search for sun java 6 plugin package
2008-07-04T03:27:00.000Z	Forest	tomd123	I've installed java already as it instructs
2008-07-04T03:27:00.000Z	tomd123	Forest	you also have to install the plugin
2008-07-04T03:27:00.000Z	Forest	tomd123	and put links in the firefox plugins folders
2008-07-04T03:27:00.000Z	tomd123	Forest	no, don't do that
2008-07-04T03:27:00.000Z	Forest	tomd123	ok, how do I install it?
2008-07-04T03:27:00.000Z	tomd123	Forest	the package should handle all of that for you
2008-07-04T03:27:00.000Z	Forest	tomd123	the package?
2008-07-04T03:28:00.000Z	Forest	tomd123	I have it...
2008-07-04T03:28:00.000Z	Forest	tomd123	just a sec
2008-07-04T03:29:00.000Z	tomd123	Forest	sudo apt-get install sun-java6-plugin
2008-07-04T03:29:00.000Z	Forest	tomd123	i have it
2008-07-04T03:29:00.000Z	Forest	tomd123	I think i might know the problem, trying to fix right now
2008-07-04T03:30:00.000Z	tomd123	Forest	just fire up firefox, what's the problem?
2008-07-04T03:30:00.000Z	Forest	tomd123	it doesn't show java is installed
2008-07-04T03:30:00.000Z	Forest	tomd123	but I'm using firefox in another folder than the official one, that may be why
2008-07-04T03:31:00.000Z	tomd123	Forest	ya..
2008-07-04T03:31:00.000Z	tomd123	Forest	well if you're compiling your own, you might have to manually add the java plugin
2008-07-04T03:32:00.000Z	Forest	tomd123	imaginator: yes just let me see if moving my folder to the one java uses will work
