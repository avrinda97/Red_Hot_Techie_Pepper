2005-10-16T05:54:00.000Z	fmasi	rob_p	after 5 minuts you see the difrence
2005-10-16T05:54:00.000Z	fmasi	rob_p	its realy fast
2005-10-16T05:57:00.000Z	fmasi	rob_p	so enny idea how to fix that i have a AMD64 leptop
2005-10-16T05:57:00.000Z	rob_p	fmasi	 You might try disabling apic in the bios and at boot time.  I've heard of issues with APIC and the system clock sharing the same interrupt and causing huge clock drift problems.  I'm not saying that is the problem but it's worth a shot.
2005-10-16T05:58:00.000Z	fmasi	rob_p	ok i will take note of that
2005-10-16T05:59:00.000Z	rob_p	fmasi	 Actually, I'd be interested to know if that solves it for you.  Do post back here if you find anything.  Boa sorte cara!
2005-10-16T06:00:00.000Z	fmasi	rob_p	ok i Will
2005-10-16T06:01:00.000Z	fmasi	rob_p	You speak portugese or just copy it ?
2005-10-16T06:02:00.000Z	rob_p	fmasi	 Yes.  I speak Portuguese.
2005-10-16T06:03:00.000Z	fmasi	rob_p	where you from?
2005-10-16T06:04:00.000Z	fmasi	rob_p	one more thing in the boot (grub i supose) how do i take it out ?
2005-10-16T06:04:00.000Z	rob_p	fmasi	 US, but I lived in Brasil for a few years.
2005-10-16T06:04:00.000Z	rob_p	fmasi	 Not sure with grub.  I use lilo.
2005-10-16T06:05:00.000Z	fmasi	rob_p	ok
2005-10-16T06:05:00.000Z	fmasi		enny one know how to take out APIC from grub boot ?
2005-10-16T06:07:00.000Z	rob_p	fmasi	 For lilo, the boot parameters for disabling APIC are, noapic nolapic.  Not sure of the syntax for the grub bootloader.
2005-10-16T06:07:00.000Z	fmasi	rob_p	i supose it wil be the same
2005-10-16T06:10:00.000Z	rob_p	fmasi	 Yes, those will be the same but not sure about what you put before or after it such as the keyword "append" in lilo.  My lilo entry has this line to disable it:  append="noapic nolapic"
2005-10-16T06:11:00.000Z	fmasi		if nobody know it i will try and see
2005-10-16T06:12:00.000Z	rob_p	fmasi	 You could also try this suggestion:  http://lists.debian.org/debian-powerpc/2003/05/msg00585.html
