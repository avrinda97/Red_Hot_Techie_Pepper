2008-03-25T02:46:00.000Z	jake2point0		linux has no good wireless support

2008-03-25T02:46:00.000Z	saschahl	jake2point0	what wireless adapter is it?
2008-03-25T02:53:00.000Z	saschahl	jake2point0	don't be too harsh. Wireless support is great in Linux but it's the vendors that decide not to support Linux.
2008-03-25T02:53:00.000Z	saschahl	jake2point0	maybe you find an open source driver for the hardware of your's. But it's hard to give support if there is only the windows driver and I don't think they are guaranteed to work.
2008-03-25T02:54:00.000Z	jake2point0	saschahl	every brand of network card that is wireless dont work without jacking with it to get it to work.  i work at a computer store where we install ubuntu on computers that come in.
2008-03-25T02:55:00.000Z	saschahl	jake2point0	my ipw2200 works out of the box. My Belkin USB dongle works out of the box.
2008-03-25T02:55:00.000Z	jake2point0	saschahl	because you knew it would work with linux first before buying
2008-03-25T02:55:00.000Z	jake2point0	saschahl	my customers dont do that
2008-03-25T02:56:00.000Z	saschahl	jake2point0	that's the problem, yes. :-S In Linux you can't always assume that the hardware works. But again it's the hardware that does not support Linux.
2008-03-25T02:57:00.000Z	jake2point0	saschahl	who do you think makes drivers for linux?  the hardware manufacturers? no.  linux programmers to make linux work with it.
2008-03-25T02:58:00.000Z	saschahl	jake2point0	who do you think makes the hardware and knows about it? it's not the linux hackers.
2008-03-25T03:00:00.000Z	jake2point0	saschahl	well, apparently unsupported usb wireless dongles are a stomach turner for ppl helping others out in here.  i give up, ill just hardline my pc to my nic.
2008-03-25T03:00:00.000Z	saschahl	jake2point0	do you know what chip the usb dongle has? maybe there are open source drivers
2008-03-25T03:01:00.000Z	jake2point0	saschahl	i dont know.  i think its D-link
2008-03-25T03:03:00.000Z	jake2point0	saschahl	what command string do i type in to get the chipset info on.
2008-03-25T03:04:00.000Z	saschahl	jake2point0	try lsusb and tell me the id
2008-03-25T03:04:00.000Z	saschahl	jake2point0	I don't know of a way to identify the chip of the device. :( The vendors usually don't tell.
2008-03-25T03:05:00.000Z	jake2point0	saschahl	its hosing if you know what i mean.  usb problem i guess
2008-03-25T03:06:00.000Z	jake2point0	saschahl	i think im gonna reboot.  its stuck
