2006-01-12T13:10:00.000Z	DivGradCurl		I've been tracking this question fairly thoroughly, and there are a lot of people with the same problem and no answer.  This is the first method I've seen.  And frankly, it makes a lot of sense and doesn't seem too hard if one understands how to tweak kernels and burn images, which I believe is intermediate.
2006-01-12T13:10:00.000Z	odat	DivGradCurl	why do you want opera
2006-01-12T13:11:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	odat	 I installed it for my dad, HE wanted Opera.  I use Firefox.
2006-01-12T13:12:00.000Z	odat	DivGradCurl	if you can't figure out how to get opera on your machine how the hell you gonna reconfigure and compile a kernel
2006-01-12T13:13:00.000Z	odat	DivGradCurl	are you familiar with synaptic?
2006-01-12T13:13:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	odat	 (a) I didn't give up on Opera, I just didn't know where to start.  And I'm not here asking for help with Opera because looking at the message boards and tweaking things around on my own is enough.
2006-01-12T13:14:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	odat	 I briefly read about Synaptic.  Either a bootloader or rescue thing, not 100% sure which.
2006-01-12T13:14:00.000Z	odat	DivGradCurl	yes here add this    deb http://deb.opera.com/opera etch non-free
2006-01-12T13:15:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	odat	 Yep, already did.  But my point about Opera is that using Synaptic manager was new for me, not that I wasnt able to research it.'
2006-01-12T13:20:00.000Z	odat	DivGradCurl	why are you trying to build a kernel
2006-01-12T13:21:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	odat	 " In a nutshell, the kernel is booted as normal; but instead of mounting the "real" root file system, a miniature root filesystem is created in RAM, and that is mounted. Any number of arbitrary steps can then be performed in this initial environment before the real root is mounted and we switch to using the real root and destroy the initial RAM disk.    This is useful in all sorts of circumstances, but for our purposes we w
2006-01-12T13:22:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	odat	" In order to use this method, we need to create two things, a kernel and an initrd image.    The kernel is just a regular kernel which has initrd support built in. The initrd image is a loopback filesystem image which contains our mini-root filesystem (this image can optionally compressed with gzip to reduce its size). " That about sums it up.
2006-01-12T13:23:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	odat	 The thing is, I'd be building the kernel for a boot disk rather than an internal, so it is (relatively) safe.
2006-01-12T13:30:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	odat	 Dad uses it for XP, it complained about missing libraries when I spent five minutes getting him to try to install it on Ubuntu.  Frankly, I'll worry about it once I have Ubuntu on my external!
2006-01-12T13:36:00.000Z	odat	DivGradCurl	go start reading
2006-01-12T13:36:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	odat	 Isn't that the answer to any noob's question?  I've spent days just figuring out this is even possible, so I don't consider myself lazy.
2006-01-12T13:39:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	odat	 Actually, at this point I've been pointed to a bdsm site by one person here and then told to "go start reading".
2006-01-12T13:40:00.000Z	odat	DivGradCurl	i come here to help out and ask a couple questions of my own but honestly i track down a lot of my problems while i'm in here   it works better if its a combination of the two
2006-01-12T13:44:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	odat	 I understand completely the need to read.  But to be frank, this is an issue that isn't well addressed by Ubuntu, anywhere, and I've had to do a shitload of research to figure out what I already have.  Coming to the conclusion that a regular boot disk and a tweaked grub won't do the trick already has tweaked out my "new stuff to read about" part of my brain.
2006-01-12T13:45:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	odat	 So, yeah, sorry if asking for help building a kernel makes me lazy, but so far the most constructive piece of advice has been "go check out another room".
2006-01-12T13:53:00.000Z	odat	DivGradCurl	maybe Damn Small Linux will do what you want
