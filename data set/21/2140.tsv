2010-01-05T06:26:00.000Z	zanberdo	mou	start by explaining what you are doing (in detail, preferably with pastebin) before complaining that no one can help. I highly doubt anyone in this channel can read your mind.
2010-01-05T06:26:00.000Z	mou	zanberdo	no just a stupid channle
2010-01-05T06:27:00.000Z	mou	zanberdo	im using tightvnc server on ubuntu 8.04 and vnc viewer on windows
2010-01-05T06:27:00.000Z	zanberdo	mou	if you find the channel is not helping you can always leave. Complaining that the channel is stupid makes it far less likely people who can help will help.
2010-01-05T06:27:00.000Z	mou	zanberdo	i prefer to insult
2010-01-05T06:28:00.000Z	zanberdo	mou	then I won't bother to assist.

2010-01-05T06:52:00.000Z	mou	zanberdo	you are just too stupid to help
2010-01-05T06:54:00.000Z	zanberdo	mou	will go away when everyone realizes he's merely here to tweak peoples nerves and ignores him. he distracts from legitimate questions and he's succeeding at what he's setting out to do, which is to draw attention.
