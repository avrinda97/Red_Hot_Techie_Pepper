2011-10-24T16:14:00.000Z	private_meta		OH COME ON!!!!
2011-10-24T16:14:00.000Z	private_meta		I can't even start the Ubuntu Server REscue Mode WITHOUT A CD ROM DRIVE?
2011-10-24T16:14:00.000Z	private_meta		I can't believe it!
2011-10-24T16:15:00.000Z	tomodachi	private_meta	what is this rescue mode? just boot it in single mode if possible.  that dont require any cd
2011-10-24T16:15:00.000Z	tomodachi	private_meta	 if not just boot of some usb device to get access to your filesystem.
2011-10-24T16:15:00.000Z	private_meta	tomodachi	I can't boot at all
2011-10-24T16:16:00.000Z	tomodachi	private_meta	ive seen intel netboot interfering with boot somettimes (might have been a buggy bios) try disabling it.
2011-10-24T16:16:00.000Z	private_meta	tomodachi	I can't
2011-10-24T16:17:00.000Z	tomodachi	private_meta	try upgrading your bios. Possibly you installed the mbr wrongly if you dont even see any reference to grub
2011-10-24T16:18:00.000Z	private_meta	tomodachi	whenever I try to boot from the hard drive it goes into network boot mode
2011-10-24T16:18:00.000Z	tomodachi	private_meta	it probably fails because there is nothing to boot of from the hd.
2011-10-24T16:18:00.000Z	private_meta	tomodachi	that's why I wanted to use rescue mode to fix grub, but I don'T really know how
2011-10-24T16:19:00.000Z	tomodachi	private_meta	i think manually fixing grub might be more work than worth it. If you dont feel like going the hard way and learning that part, you can just try to reinstall..
2011-10-24T16:19:00.000Z	private_meta	tomodachi	I could do that, but it took forever to get the system up from the USB drive...
2011-10-24T16:19:00.000Z	private_meta	tomodachi	in rescue mode, shouldn't the "boot" directory still be available?
2011-10-24T16:20:00.000Z	tomodachi	private_meta	ive never used this rescue mode you refer to. But if you boot of something else than your default os then yes. If the drives work you can gain access to all folders / partitions including boot
2011-10-24T16:21:00.000Z	private_meta	tomodachi	I'm just using the ubuntu install cd and use the emergency shell or somethinglike that
2011-10-24T16:22:00.000Z	private_meta	tomodachi	According to BusyBox/ash there is no "boot" directory in the root folder of the drive
2011-10-24T16:36:00.000Z	tomodachi	private_meta	if its a busybox shell chances are high you havent even gotten your filesystem mounted at all
2011-10-24T16:36:00.000Z	tomodachi	private_meta	 cat /proc/partitions will tell you what disks are shown (if proc is mounted)  also type mount ,to see if it makes sence
2011-10-24T16:36:00.000Z	private_meta	tomodachi	after I finish the reinstall, and in case it still doesn't work, I will
