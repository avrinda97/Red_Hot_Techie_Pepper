2011-05-26T19:51:00.000Z	Pici	dorgan	Is cron runing?
2011-05-26T19:51:00.000Z	dorgan	Pici	yes cron is running
2011-05-26T19:51:00.000Z	dorgan		anacron is not installed....and I can manually issue a run-parts
2011-05-26T19:54:00.000Z	Pici	dorgan	Have you modified your /etc/crontab file yourself?
2011-05-26T19:54:00.000Z	dorgan		yeah I changed the times things run
2011-05-26T19:54:00.000Z	dorgan		but I did that on my other systems as well...so they all match
2011-05-26T19:54:00.000Z	dorgan	Pici	that was for you
2011-05-26T19:54:00.000Z	dorgan		sorry
2011-05-26T19:55:00.000Z	Pici	dorgan	Is there a newline at the end of the file?  That needs to be there for it to run properly.
2011-05-26T19:56:00.000Z	dorgan	Pici	theres just a # at the end of the file...just like all the others, which are working fine
2011-05-26T19:57:00.000Z	Pici	dorgan	Do you mind pastebinning that file?
2011-05-26T19:57:00.000Z	dorgan	Pici	http://pastie.org/private/7fb5qlpw7dkm6zhkpdlgdg
2011-05-26T20:01:00.000Z	Pici	dorgan	Are you getting any relevant entries in /var/log/auth.log when each cron entry is supposed to run?
2011-05-26T20:04:00.000Z	dorgan	Pici	sorry stepped away...checking now
2011-05-26T20:07:00.000Z	dorgan	Pici	It looks like I may be

2011-05-26T20:18:00.000Z	Pici	dorgan	Yes?
2011-05-26T20:18:00.000Z	dorgan		I answered your question
2011-05-26T20:19:00.000Z	Pici	dorgan	Anything that looks like an error?
2011-05-26T20:19:00.000Z	dorgan		nope
2011-05-26T20:20:00.000Z	Pici	dorgan	I'm afraid I'm out of ideas then.  Perhaps someone else can lend a hand, or you could try asking in #ubuntu-server
