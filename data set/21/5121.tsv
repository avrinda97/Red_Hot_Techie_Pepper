2008-12-22T20:03:00.000Z	Torgoton		I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my '486 laptop. Again. The latest (intrepid) boot image crashes hard. Dapper and Edgy both worked, but not Gutsy. Should I try Hardy or just go with Dapper and upgrade?
2008-12-22T20:04:00.000Z	Gnea	Torgoton	ubuntu isn't meant to run on 486 hardware, it's too old. you might have better luck with xubuntu or elivecd
2008-12-22T20:05:00.000Z	Torgoton	Gnea	Absolute minimum on system requirements says 486 with 32MB RAM... I have 36 :)
2008-12-22T20:05:00.000Z	Gnea	Torgoton	where are you getting this information?
2008-12-22T20:06:00.000Z	Torgoton	Gnea	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements#Absolute%20minimum%20installation
2008-12-22T20:07:00.000Z	Gnea	Torgoton	"However, installation may be extremely difficult and Ubuntu is likely to run very slowly on such a system. "
2008-12-22T20:08:00.000Z	Torgoton	Gnea	Oh it's slow alright. Gnome in 320x200 isn't fun (or usable) either, but I want to install it anyway. Even just text mode would be fine.
2008-12-22T20:08:00.000Z	Gnea	Torgoton	in that case, you might as well install ubuntu server
2008-12-22T20:09:00.000Z	Torgoton	Gnea	Is there a different netboot image for server?
2008-12-22T20:09:00.000Z	Gnea	Torgoton	probably.
2008-12-22T20:10:00.000Z	Gnea	Torgoton	url?

2008-12-22T20:11:00.000Z	Gnea	Torgoton	oh man....... the thinkpad 700 series
2008-12-22T20:11:00.000Z	Torgoton	Gnea	Still the best laptop keyboard ever.
2008-12-22T20:12:00.000Z	Gnea	Torgoton	first time i installed debian was on a thinkpad 750 - no GUI, textmode only. wrote a HOWTO, still have it somewhere, it's been on my TODO list to resurrect it.
2008-12-22T20:12:00.000Z	Torgoton	Gnea	Get that on ThinkWiki!
2008-12-22T20:12:00.000Z	Gnea	Torgoton	and why? because slackware and redhat couldn't boot at all on it.
2008-12-22T20:13:00.000Z	Torgoton	Gnea	Redhat requires a Pentium. Fascists. :)
2008-12-22T20:13:00.000Z	Gnea	Torgoton	redhat 4.2 >;)
2008-12-22T20:14:00.000Z	Gnea	Torgoton	this was over a decade ago.
2008-12-22T20:15:00.000Z	Gnea	Torgoton	I'm going to see if I can find it this weekend
