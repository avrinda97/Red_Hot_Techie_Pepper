2005-04-16T10:26:00.000Z	netventure		hi
2005-04-16T10:26:00.000Z	netventure		can someone help me configure a mail server?
2005-04-16T10:27:00.000Z	topyli	netventure	if you get my p3nfs and irda working :)
2005-04-16T10:28:00.000Z	topyli	netventure	do you have a specific problem with it?
2005-04-16T10:29:00.000Z	netventure	topyli	Actually, I've never done it before
2005-04-16T10:30:00.000Z	topyli	netventure	just saying your request is a bit generic, no offense
2005-04-16T10:30:00.000Z	netventure	topyli	I understand, but this is theonly place I know... on IRC
2005-04-16T10:31:00.000Z	topyli	netventure	not sendmail, that's an easy choice. postfix, exim are easy to set up
2005-04-16T10:32:00.000Z	netventure	topyli	you sere something about getting p3nfs and irda to work...
2005-04-16T10:34:00.000Z	topyli	netventure	that's just something i've been working on for a couple of months that's all :)
2005-04-16T10:35:00.000Z	netventure	topyli	er... what is p3nfs?
2005-04-16T10:35:00.000Z	topyli	netventure	a daemon for mounting a nokia communicator and other psion/symbian devices on unixen
2005-04-16T10:36:00.000Z	topyli	netventure	i can already mount the damn phone read-only, i'm working on write support :)
2005-04-16T10:36:00.000Z	netventure	topyli	hmmm... I'm new to the cellphone world.... I've got to connect a nokia 6610 via IrDA to a WinXP PC
2005-04-16T10:37:00.000Z	topyli	netventure	yeah, it sucks. nokia is supposed to be a big open source company but their phones only support windows
2005-04-16T10:38:00.000Z	topyli	netventure	both
2005-04-16T10:39:00.000Z	netventure	topyli	what's your IrDA receiver device/chipset?
2005-04-16T10:40:00.000Z	topyli	netventure	a tekram serial dongle
2005-04-16T10:40:00.000Z	topyli	netventure	but that's another issue. i'd prefer to use the cable
2005-04-16T10:41:00.000Z	topyli	netventure	i know it by heart. the dongle is hooked to the windows box these days, i get p3nfs read-only via cable which is half-good
2005-04-16T10:45:00.000Z	topyli	netventure	anyway, if you use ubuntu, you have postfix already installed, and working on localhost. setting up a full-fledged server takes half an hour if you know nothing to begin with
