2011-09-23T01:46:00.000Z	kylefox		I need to enable multiverse -- I know how to do it manually (editing /etc/apt/sources.list) but I'm wondering if there's a way I can automate it through a script
2011-09-23T01:47:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	sure
2011-09-23T01:47:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	easy shell script to echo your text to the sources list
2011-09-23T01:48:00.000Z	kylefox	Praet0rian	oh ... I never thought of that
2011-09-23T01:48:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	it depends what shell you're using
2011-09-23T01:52:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	to send text to a file simply do this: echo '<string>' >> <filename>
2011-09-23T02:33:00.000Z	kylefox	Praet0rian	I'm back :) I seem to be having permission issues with that multiverse thing you suggested: http://dpaste.com/619247/ -- any ideas?
2011-09-23T02:34:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	are you executing this as sh myScript?
2011-09-23T02:35:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	do this, create an empty file in your home, then run it
2011-09-23T02:36:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	also just a tip if you don't want to use "sh" to execute, put !#/bin/bash in the file
2011-09-23T02:37:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	also would be wise to set that string as a variable then echo it to stdout to see if its correct
2011-09-23T02:37:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	Polah is correct too, I assumed you set +x
2011-09-23T02:40:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	did you do waht I said
2011-09-23T02:40:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	instead of the destination as the sources list, try to echo to a home directory file
2011-09-23T02:42:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	for which one, home or sources?
2011-09-23T02:43:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	ok so it works then
2011-09-23T02:44:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	ok so we know the script is sound
2011-09-23T02:44:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	what error do you get when you ran that first one
2011-09-23T02:45:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	you cannt run it as norm
2011-09-23T02:46:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	then thats why you cant run it
2011-09-23T02:46:00.000Z	Praet0rian	kylefox	you of course cannot write to protected files without root privs
