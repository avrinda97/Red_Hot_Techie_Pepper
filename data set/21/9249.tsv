2007-03-28T06:08:00.000Z	Flannel	KurtKraut	nano is probably easiest
2007-06-29T12:01:00.000Z	Flannel	KurtKraut	also, #ubuntu+1 for Gutsy support
2007-06-29T12:01:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Flannel	thanks for the quick answer.
2007-06-29T12:02:00.000Z	Flannel	KurtKraut	the first link (the install ones) has a bunch of non-CD methods to install.
2007-06-29T12:03:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Flannel	after proceeding with the install, the new system will be added to the current GRUB ?
2009-02-25T08:20:00.000Z	Flannel	KurtKraut	I think most people just use nullmailer or something similar
2009-02-25T08:21:00.000Z	Flannel	KurtKraut	Or esmtp is a popular (and easy) one
2009-02-25T08:21:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Flannel	nullmailer seems to lack a lot of features for my need. I'll check. esmtp

2009-02-25T08:22:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Flannel	let me explain my scenario. I want a CLI email client for my Eee
2009-10-29T10:09:00.000Z	Flannel	KurtKraut	The ISOs aren't available yet.
2009-10-29T10:09:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Flannel	and the dist-upgrade?
2009-10-29T10:10:00.000Z	Flannel	KurtKraut	I don't know.  It's probably less lock-step than the ISOs.  But no, it's not released yet.
2009-10-29T10:10:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Flannel	thanks for the info.
2009-11-01T04:57:00.000Z	Flannel	KurtKraut	#ubuntu-motu can help you out
2009-11-01T04:57:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Flannel	thanks
2010-02-25T08:38:00.000Z	Flannel	KurtKraut	Nitsuga: #ubuntu-br is for the BR LoCo team, pt language support is in -pt
2010-02-25T08:38:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Flannel	really? Is that official?
2010-02-25T08:40:00.000Z	Flannel	KurtKraut	Oh sorry, that's backwards.  -pt is LoCo, -br is language.  And it's official as of a few years ago when the factoid was changed
2010-02-25T08:41:00.000Z	Flannel	KurtKraut	(that's why the -pt factoid says to join -br for support, and -pt for the loco)
2010-02-25T08:41:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Flannel	oh, I got it.
