2010-05-09T07:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	acerimmer	you can't
2010-05-09T07:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	acerimmer	as far as I know
2010-05-09T07:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	acerimmer	also only do stuff like that, if you know what your doing, and really need it
2010-05-09T07:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	acerimmer	otherwise best to not bother, since you could get issues later on

2010-05-13T03:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	acerimmer	 calibre  no people should  not upgrade their bios at all, unless there is a proper reason to
2010-05-13T03:27:00.000Z	acerimmer	sebsebseb	for instance, dell put out a bios update about 3 months after i purchased.

2010-05-13T06:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	acerimmer	however  he is having issue installing xchat from the terminal at the moment
2010-05-13T06:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	acerimmer	was like that on the Live CD, but also the install
2010-05-13T06:22:00.000Z	acerimmer	sebsebseb	just came back. obviously into middle of your convo.  now shutting my mouth

2010-06-14T07:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	acerimmer	yes kelly_  seems to want some propritary  burning software working in Ubuntu,  and maybe kelly doesn't know about Brasero and K3B
