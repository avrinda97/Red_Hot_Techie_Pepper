2009-09-06T12:18:00.000Z	Deepwaters		I've had trouble getting the restricted drivers enabled for my nvidia Geforce 8600GT running on Ubuntu 9.04. I have gone into synaptic and deleted EVERYTHING with "Nvidia" in it, kernels, everything. So entirely clean slate. Can somebody walk me through how to properly enable the "restricted" drivers?
2009-09-06T12:18:00.000Z	und3rgr0undz3r0	Deepwaters	are you using the PPC port?
2009-09-06T12:19:00.000Z	Deepwaters		no idea
2009-09-06T12:19:00.000Z	Deepwaters	und3rgr0undz3r0	 no idea
2009-09-06T12:19:00.000Z	und3rgr0undz3r0	Deepwaters	are you using a mac or PC?
2009-09-06T12:20:00.000Z	Deepwaters	und3rgr0undz3r0	 that option is no longer there since I removed everything, and I'm using PC components
2009-09-06T12:20:00.000Z	Deepwaters	und3rgr0undz3r0	 it is important to note that I built this machine
2009-09-06T12:20:00.000Z	und3rgr0undz3r0	Deepwaters	do a google search for envyNG
2009-09-06T12:21:00.000Z	Deepwaters	und3rgr0undz3r0	 what am I looking for?
2009-09-06T12:21:00.000Z	und3rgr0undz3r0		its a tool to install the lastest NVIDIA or ATI drivers for x86 (PC) based computers
2009-09-06T12:22:00.000Z	und3rgr0undz3r0		I'm running 9.04 ppc and I have an ATI RAGE 128 pro, 32mb vram, does anyone know how to Install the drivers? they arent in teh restircted drivers manager!
2009-09-06T12:23:00.000Z	Deepwaters	und3rgr0undz3r0	 sokay, so I sudo apt-get install envyng-gt
2009-09-06T12:23:00.000Z	Deepwaters	und3rgr0undz3r0	 right?
2009-09-06T12:24:00.000Z	und3rgr0undz3r0	Deepwaters	if it says to do that, I havent used it recently and right now I'm using a command line only system usign IRSSI to do IRC chat. That sounds right, though.
2009-09-06T12:24:00.000Z	und3rgr0undz3r0		then isntall the appropriate driver
2009-09-06T12:24:00.000Z	Deepwaters	und3rgr0undz3r0	 and these are the "restricted" drivers, right? that will enable full environment effects and whatnot?
2009-09-06T12:26:00.000Z	und3rgr0undz3r0	Deepwaters	Yes, those are the proprietary drivers created by NVIDIA.
2009-09-06T12:27:00.000Z	Deepwaters	und3rgr0undz3r0	 then I'll simply be able to enable the full effects in Appearance?
2009-09-06T12:27:00.000Z	und3rgr0undz3r0	Deepwaters	YES
2009-09-06T12:27:00.000Z	Deepwaters	und3rgr0undz3r0	 thank you, sorry to ask the same question over and over but you (may) not believe the trouble I've gone through
2009-09-06T12:29:00.000Z	Deepwaters	und3rgr0undz3r0	 when trying to enable Extra effects, it simply said that they could not be enabled and reverted me to None
