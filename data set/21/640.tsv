2012-05-29T08:53:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		Could anyone explain to me how to safely upgrade my (proprietary) AMD graphics drivers? Apparently I have to uninstall the old versions first, and I'm terrified of doing that after the nightmare I went through getting them to work in the first place...

2012-05-29T08:56:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	pepee	thanks!
2012-05-29T08:57:00.000Z	pepee	ForSpareParts	btw, if you get a black screen after that, you need to remove a specific file  ( /etc/ati/amdpcsdb ) and reboot
2012-05-29T11:49:00.000Z	pepee	ForSpareParts	try unplugging and then plugging the cables
2012-05-29T11:50:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	pepee	cables?
2012-05-29T11:50:00.000Z	pepee	ForSpareParts	usb
2012-05-29T11:52:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	pepee	do you have any other ideas? I'm totally stuck...
2012-05-29T11:52:00.000Z	pepee	ForSpareParts	nope :/
2012-05-29T11:52:00.000Z	pepee	ForSpareParts	reinstall? use a serial cable?
2012-05-29T11:52:00.000Z	pepee	ForSpareParts	ahh yeah, that too
2012-05-29T11:53:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	pepee	how would I do that? Google seems to suggest that I'd need to be able to change some config files before that would be an option...
2012-05-29T11:53:00.000Z	pepee	ForSpareParts	remove "ro quiet splash" and add "init=/bin/bash"
2012-05-29T11:54:00.000Z	pepee	ForSpareParts	no, you dont need to do that
2012-05-29T11:54:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	pepee	Sorry, but remove and add to...?
2012-05-29T11:54:00.000Z	pepee	ForSpareParts	press e or c to edit the kernel command line in grub2
2012-05-29T11:58:00.000Z	pepee	ForSpareParts	^
2012-05-29T11:58:00.000Z	pepee	ForSpareParts	downloaded all the necessary files?
2012-05-29T11:59:00.000Z	pepee	ForSpareParts	in that case, dpkg should be able to repair the system, I think
2012-05-29T12:13:00.000Z	pepee	ForSpareParts	yeah, liveCD is better
2012-05-29T12:14:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	pepee	Got it. DOWNLOAD TIME
