2007-08-28T14:21:00.000Z	reD_Fox1		anyone have any idea why ubuntu would boot correctly after hanging during one boot, and visa versa?
2007-08-28T14:22:00.000Z	kazim59	reD_Fox1	do you hibernate it?
2007-08-28T14:22:00.000Z	reD_Fox1	kazim59	no
2007-08-28T14:22:00.000Z	kazim59	reD_Fox1	when it hangs, what does it say before hanging itself?
2007-08-28T14:22:00.000Z	reD_Fox1	kazim59	in fact, I think it will boot after hibernating
2007-08-28T14:23:00.000Z	reD_Fox1	kazim59	it hangs on a blank ("dead") screen
2007-08-28T14:23:00.000Z	reD_Fox1	kazim59	it appears to be just as gnome is loading
2007-08-28T14:24:00.000Z	kazim59	reD_Fox1	can you get a login prompt by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 when it hangs?
2007-08-28T14:24:00.000Z	reD_Fox1	kazim59	no, and ctrl-alt-del will not reboot, either
2007-08-28T14:25:00.000Z	reD_Fox1	kazim59	when I reboot the computer manually to recover from the hang, it boots fine
2007-08-28T14:25:00.000Z	kazim59	reD_Fox1	can you copy /var/log/messages to a pastie?
2007-08-28T14:26:00.000Z	kazim59	reD_Fox1	seems that it hangs after a proper shutdown... right?
2007-08-28T14:27:00.000Z	reD_Fox1	kazim59	correct
2007-08-28T14:31:00.000Z	kazim59	reD_Fox1	can you give me contents of /etc/fstab?
2007-08-28T14:31:00.000Z	reD_Fox1	kazim59	yeah, I think (running a mandriva live cd right now)
2007-08-28T14:32:00.000Z	kazim59	reD_Fox1	try to run fsck.ext3 on your linux partition (make sure its not mounted!)
2007-08-28T14:34:00.000Z	reD_Fox1	kazim59	ok, but I don't see what that would have to do with only being able to boot every other time :)
2007-08-28T14:40:00.000Z	reD_Fox1	kazim59	ok, I have the fstab file, do you still need it? it only has the mount info for the cdrom (/dev/hdc) and root (/)
2007-08-28T14:40:00.000Z	kazim59	reD_Fox1	are you sure its your linux's fstab? and not live cd's fstab?
2007-08-28T14:40:00.000Z	reD_Fox1	kazim59	no :)
2007-08-28T14:41:00.000Z	kazim59	reD_Fox1	make it sure then
