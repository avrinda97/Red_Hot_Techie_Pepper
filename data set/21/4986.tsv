2009-11-14T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	n00b_	can you use http://pastebin.com   to give the output of: sudo apt-get update
2009-11-14T22:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	n00b_	you have added a repository, but not its GPG key
2009-11-14T23:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	n00b_	depends on the code thats output in the output, you can copy and paste to and from a terminal, you should use gnome-terminal
2009-11-14T23:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	n00b_	use the mouse to right click the selected text, then click copy
2009-11-14T23:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	n00b_	try: http://www.pastie.org
2009-11-14T23:03:00.000Z	n00b_	ActionParsnip	Pasted at http://www.pastie.org/698792 .. (thanks).
2009-11-14T23:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	n00b_	great. Thanks :). looks ok can you do the same with: sudo apt-get upgrade
2009-11-14T23:07:00.000Z	n00b_	ActionParsnip	http://www.pastie.org/698798 .. here is it ... thanks again.
2009-11-14T23:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	n00b_	is it any better if you run it as you user, rather than root (shouldnt make a difference but is worth exploring)
2009-11-14T23:08:00.000Z	n00b_	ActionParsnip	I tried it both ways... the results are some.
2009-11-14T23:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	n00b_	i'd say go for it but  log a bug
2010-07-15T19:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	n00b_	what are you trying to achieve exactly?
2010-07-15T19:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	n00b_	why during startup? It's not going to change between then and login....
2010-07-15T19:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	n00b_	sure but between the battery state and login it won't change, so running a command every 2 seconds or whatever will have zero difference
2010-07-15T19:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	n00b_	if you put the script where DrMax__ says then it will run at logon
2010-07-15T19:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	n00b_	i'll give you a script, gimme a sec
2010-07-15T19:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	n00b_	http://pastie.org/1045644    run: gksudo gedit /usr/bin/listpackages; chmod +x /usr/bin/listpackages     paste the text into the script, save the file and close gedit
2010-07-15T19:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	n00b_	then add the command /usr/bin/listpackages   to your startup items
