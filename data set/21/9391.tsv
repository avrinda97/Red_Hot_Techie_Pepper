2007-02-05T07:13:00.000Z	zyth		back in the day :)
2007-02-05T07:13:00.000Z	zyth		I programmed my first assembler in pascal.
2007-02-05T07:13:00.000Z	zyth		hehe
2007-02-05T07:14:00.000Z	zyth		nah, there's pascal packages for ubuntu
2007-02-05T07:14:00.000Z	zyth		;)
2007-02-05T07:14:00.000Z	zyth		!info freepascal
2007-02-05T07:14:00.000Z	zyth		hmm
2007-02-05T07:14:00.000Z	zyth		I am sure it DOES
2007-02-05T07:14:00.000Z	zyth		sec.
2007-02-05T07:15:00.000Z	zyth		yep there it is
2007-02-05T07:16:00.000Z	ardchoille	zyth	Is it the fp-compiler you're talking about?
2007-02-05T07:16:00.000Z	zyth	ardchoille	yes, it is
2007-02-18T10:59:00.000Z	ardchoille	zyth	You on Dapper or Edgy?
2007-02-18T10:59:00.000Z	zyth	ardchoille	edgy
2007-02-18T10:59:00.000Z	ardchoille	zyth	I think so
2007-02-18T11:00:00.000Z	ardchoille	zyth	A couple wiki's I saw today say beryl on Dapper can be a lot of work, but Edgy seems to be supported.
2007-02-20T12:02:00.000Z	ardchoille	zyth	That won't help
2007-02-20T12:02:00.000Z	zyth	ardchoille	weird, I can run scripts not as root
2007-02-20T12:03:00.000Z	ardchoille	zyth	a script owned by root, sudo chmod +x will enable it executable for the root user.
2007-02-20T12:04:00.000Z	ardchoille	zyth	You would need to sudo chmod a+x to make it executable for all users.
2007-02-20T12:04:00.000Z	zyth	ardchoille	ahh
