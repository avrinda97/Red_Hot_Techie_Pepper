2005-09-21T11:11:00.000Z	khermans		Should an AMD64 chip running in 32-bit mode OS use linux-k7 ???
2005-09-21T11:12:00.000Z	khermans		just wanted to make sure there was nothing wrong with that
2005-09-21T11:14:00.000Z	trigg	khermans	should be there, I'm running it. . .
2005-09-21T11:14:00.000Z	khermans	trigg	i thought i saw it before i rebooted from 386 into 686 -- now i dont see it anymore
2005-09-21T11:15:00.000Z	trigg	khermans	like bob2 said, just make sure you have "restricted" in your sources.list
2005-09-21T11:16:00.000Z	trigg	khermans	here is the package name: linux-image-2.6.12-8-k7
2005-09-21T11:16:00.000Z	trigg	khermans	amek sure you have this - deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu breezy-updates main restricted
2005-09-21T11:17:00.000Z	khermans	trigg	yes i have that too
2005-09-21T11:17:00.000Z	trigg	khermans	I mean this - deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu breezy main restricted ;)
2005-09-21T11:17:00.000Z	trigg	khermans	how about multivers and univers?
2005-09-21T11:17:00.000Z	trigg	khermans	how about multivers and universe?
2005-09-21T11:18:00.000Z	trigg	khermans	do an apt-cache search k7
2005-09-21T11:18:00.000Z	khermans	trigg	yes it is there now
2005-09-21T11:18:00.000Z	trigg	khermans	yea! ;)
2005-09-21T11:19:00.000Z	trigg	khermans	have to include hoary-extras or hoary-backports for that -- or use marilats repo
2005-09-21T11:20:00.000Z	khermans	trigg	are there official breezy-extras and breezy-backports yet
2005-09-21T11:21:00.000Z	trigg	khermans	the skeleton base structure is there, but I don't think there will actually be any packages until breezy is 'stable'
2005-09-21T11:25:00.000Z	trigg	khermans	as long as you are using GDM, then just pick your Session
2005-09-21T11:26:00.000Z	trigg	khermans	when you are logging in, just pick the Sessions menu in the bottom left hand corner
2005-09-21T11:26:00.000Z	khermans	trigg	ahh yes, thx!
2005-09-21T11:27:00.000Z	trigg	khermans	no prob. :)
