2007-11-28T18:47:00.000Z	chazco	ger_3D	some minor issues, but otherwise yes
2007-11-28T18:49:00.000Z	ger_3D	chazco	and compiz-fusion works on that graphics card
2007-11-28T18:50:00.000Z	ger_3D	chazco	good to hear, thinking of buying that one
2007-11-28T18:50:00.000Z	chazco	ger_3D	- I think the u300 is similar to the u200, and the u200 is _very_ well supported in Linux for a laptop :)
2007-11-28T18:51:00.000Z	ger_3D	chazco	what wireless do you have on the u200?
2007-11-28T18:53:00.000Z	chazco	ger_3D	seems to so far... even the built in bluetooth works fine
2007-11-28T18:53:00.000Z	ger_3D	chazco	grat thats the one i'm thinking of buying
2007-11-28T18:54:00.000Z	ger_3D	chazco	the U300
