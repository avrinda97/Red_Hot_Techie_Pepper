2008-04-08T01:30:00.000Z	jonaskoelker		anyone care to help me?
2008-04-08T01:31:00.000Z	jonaskoelker		Hi all.  I could use some help with my sdl games; some of them start running really slowly and jerkily a short while (1-5 minutes) after starting them (nexuiz, openarena, supertux, kobo deluxe using "SDL 2D"), while some of them run just fine (battle for wesnoth, kobo deluxe using "OpenGL/glSDL").  What's going on?  How can I make all the games run at decent speeds
2008-04-08T01:33:00.000Z	noodlesgc	jonaskoelker	what gfx card do you have?
2008-04-08T01:33:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	noodlesgc	intel
2008-04-08T01:33:00.000Z	noodlesgc	jonaskoelker	i can help
2008-04-08T01:34:00.000Z	noodlesgc	jonaskoelker	go to /etc/X11/xorg.conf as root
2008-04-08T01:34:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	noodlesgc	in vi as we speak
2008-04-08T01:35:00.000Z	noodlesgc	jonaskoelker	add this to your "Device" section: Option "DRI" "true"
2008-04-08T01:36:00.000Z	noodlesgc	jonaskoelker	now a reboot, or a ctrl+alt+backspace should be all you need
2008-04-08T01:37:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	noodlesgc	did the M-C-^H; the framerate of glxgears dropped a slight bit,
2008-04-08T01:38:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	noodlesgc	also, if I move the glxgears window in compiz-fusion, the gears at the old position don't get overdrawn by the window that's now taking up that space
2008-04-08T01:38:00.000Z	noodlesgc	jonaskoelker	what brand intel card do you have? 965?
2008-04-08T01:40:00.000Z	noodlesgc	jonaskoelker	was your gfx card blacklisted?
2008-04-08T01:40:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	noodlesgc	blacklisted?
2008-04-08T01:41:00.000Z	noodlesgc	jonaskoelker	did you have to do anything special to get compiz working?
2008-04-08T01:41:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	noodlesgc	I don't think so...
2008-04-08T01:42:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	noodlesgc	but I may be inaccurate in assigning significance to what I did, and remember badly...
2008-04-08T01:43:00.000Z	noodlesgc	jonaskoelker	so the games are still slow?
2008-04-08T01:45:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	noodlesgc	the games are still slow
2008-04-08T02:00:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	noodlesgc	might my issues be due to GPU overheating?
2008-04-08T02:00:00.000Z	noodlesgc	jonaskoelker	i dont know.
