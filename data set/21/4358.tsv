2009-03-24T09:20:00.000Z	elad		pradyumna, my computer's specs?
2009-03-24T09:20:00.000Z	elad		E6600, NVIDIA 8800 GTS, 2GB of RAM
2009-03-24T09:21:00.000Z	elad		pradyumna, yeah. Why?
2009-03-24T09:22:00.000Z	elad		pradyumna, what drivers should I use, then?
2009-03-24T09:23:00.000Z	elad		Given that my graphics card is an NVIDIA 8800GTS, which drivers should I use for best performance?
2009-03-24T09:23:00.000Z	elad		Issue - scrolling in firefox is very clunky.
2009-03-24T09:24:00.000Z	elad		pradyumna, no.
2009-03-24T09:25:00.000Z	elad		No.

2009-03-24T09:25:00.000Z	jimdb	elad	You weren't prompted by ubuntu to use the hardware drivers it suggested?
2009-03-24T09:25:00.000Z	elad	jimdb	I'm using the ones it has suggested. 177 something.
2009-03-24T09:27:00.000Z	jimdb	elad	Those aren't the latest from nvidia but they are the proprietary drivers nonethless. You could go to nvisias sit and download for install the latest.
2009-03-24T09:28:00.000Z	elad	jimdb	installing their latest hasn't worked out well for me the last time. X wouldn't start.
2009-03-24T09:29:00.000Z	jimdb	elad	I have the same prob. But that is the real question you should be asking in here
2009-03-24T09:31:00.000Z	jimdb	elad	I was successfulngetting the latest tobinstall on a clean install of ubuntu, but not on an olde ubuntu install with the newest drivers
2009-03-24T09:33:00.000Z	elad	jimdb	so the problem is in the interaction with the 177-version installed?
2009-03-24T09:33:00.000Z	elad	jimdb	meaning, if I hadn't installed the 177, I could have installed nvidia's latest without a hitch?
2009-03-24T09:33:00.000Z	jimdb	elad	How new is your current install?
2009-03-24T09:34:00.000Z	elad	jimdb	fresh of the CD.
2009-03-24T09:37:00.000Z	jimdb	elad	Here is what I did. I had an old install using up to date drivers from nvidia. When the latest set came out I couldn't get them to work without x complaining and pitting me in low red mode
