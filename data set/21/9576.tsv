2006-03-03T16:35:00.000Z	zaxxon		it has a LED on it , that usualy flashes( on a windows pc, if its connected yet b4 it is installed)
2006-03-03T16:35:00.000Z	zaxxon		yes rug - conexant system
2006-03-03T16:36:00.000Z	Rug		have you googled for conexant
2006-03-03T16:36:00.000Z	zaxxon		e-tech adsl usb modem v2
2006-03-03T16:36:00.000Z	zaxxon		not just yet, i just thought that as the LED does not even blink, the usb might not have powered it up yet
2006-03-03T16:37:00.000Z	Rug	zaxxon	if it is showing up in lsusb, then the OS has detected it.
