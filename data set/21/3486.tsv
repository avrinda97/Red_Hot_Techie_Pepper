2009-01-30T23:06:00.000Z	krishnan	ikonia	pls give more detail on irc server and im service
2009-03-03T14:12:00.000Z	krishnan	ikonia	I have got a new broadband connection just now. I connected it to my netgear wireless router, to which my laptop, server and desktops are connected. the LAN ip addr are 10.0.0.2 instead of 192.168.1.2. This was nt so with my old ISP. please help me out. however the internet is working fine
2009-03-03T14:12:00.000Z	ikonia	krishnan	not sure wht your asking
2009-03-03T14:13:00.000Z	ikonia	krishnan	it looks like your getting dhcp from a new device on a new private address range, it's not a problem
2009-03-03T14:13:00.000Z	ikonia	krishnan	10. and 192 re just common private address ranges
2009-03-03T14:14:00.000Z	krishnan	ikonia	but the server on which i hosted the website is not viewable
2009-03-03T14:14:00.000Z	ikonia	krishnan	probably because your port forwarding is no setup on your new router
2009-03-03T14:15:00.000Z	krishnan	ikonia	it is setup
2009-03-03T14:15:00.000Z	ikonia	krishnan	well it must be setup to point to the old 192 address
2009-03-03T14:17:00.000Z	krishnan	ikonia	according to the modem the IPs are in 192 series. but according to the router they are in 10. series
2009-03-03T14:17:00.000Z	ikonia	krishnan	ok - so you've got conflicting ip ranges
2009-03-03T14:18:00.000Z	krishnan	ikonia	yes
2009-03-03T14:18:00.000Z	krishnan	ikonia	what can be done now?
2009-03-03T14:18:00.000Z	ikonia	krishnan	well you need to get the IP info from 1 source, either the router or the modem, OR set them both to use the same network
2009-03-03T14:19:00.000Z	ikonia	krishnan	my advice would be to disable dhcp on one device and only get dhcp info from the modem
2009-03-03T14:19:00.000Z	krishnan	ikonia	i will try that
