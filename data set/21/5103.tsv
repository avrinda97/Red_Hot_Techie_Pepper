2008-04-04T07:33:00.000Z	HinHin		is there anyway to force apt-get to remove packages? despite if the packages are broken?
2008-04-04T07:33:00.000Z	HinHin		i can't install the broken packages with sudo apt-get -f install
2008-04-04T07:34:00.000Z	troxor	HinHin	could you paste the output to pastebin?
2008-04-04T07:34:00.000Z	HinHin	troxor	sure
2008-04-04T07:48:00.000Z	HinHin	troxor	o.o... i fixed it with Synaptic

2008-04-04T07:38:00.000Z	troxor	HinHin	try `sudo apt-get clean`
2008-04-04T07:38:00.000Z	HinHin	troxor	tried that
2008-04-04T07:38:00.000Z	HinHin	troxor	i tried to install gnome
2008-04-04T07:38:00.000Z	troxor	HinHin	try removing gnome-network-preferences first, then doing apt-get install -f
2008-04-04T07:40:00.000Z	HinHin	troxor	didn't work either...
2008-04-04T07:48:00.000Z	troxor	HinHin	sweet
2008-04-04T07:42:00.000Z	troxor	HinHin	one way to resolve it is just persist through the dependencies, removing them all until it lets you remove what you want, then reinstalling them after it's resolved
2008-04-04T07:42:00.000Z	troxor	HinHin	but the goal is to remove the package with the offending file, then run apt-get install -f
2008-04-04T07:44:00.000Z	HinHin	troxor	so there's no way to get apt-get to forgot all about installing gnome?
2008-04-04T07:46:00.000Z	troxor	HinHin	it's probably bugging you for good reason :)
2008-04-04T07:46:00.000Z	HinHin	troxor	:P but i want it just to forget it
2008-04-04T07:47:00.000Z	troxor	HinHin	pingu i686 ;)
2008-04-04T07:48:00.000Z	HinHin	troxor	thanks for the help ;)
2008-04-04T07:48:00.000Z	troxor	HinHin	no problemo, synaptic is smarter than me though :[
2008-04-04T07:49:00.000Z	HinHin	troxor	synaptic is going to rule the world
