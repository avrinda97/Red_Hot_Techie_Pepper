2006-01-10T09:55:00.000Z	D-rock		Breezy has been running great on my laptop since it was released, but in the past 2 weeks it has been hanging all of the time.
2006-01-10T09:56:00.000Z	D-rock		Well, I dual booted to windows and windows runs fine. I also tried swapping the HD into an identical laptop and I get the same hangs
2006-01-10T09:56:00.000Z	D-rock		If it's plugged into Ethernet it usually only hangs 4-6 times a day
2006-01-10T09:57:00.000Z	D-rock		If it's not plugged into Ethernet it will sometimes hang on boot and will usually only last 5-10 minutes
2006-01-10T09:58:00.000Z	D-rock		SMART values are all within thresholds
2006-01-10T09:58:00.000Z	D-rock		I've run memtest and it came up clean
2006-01-10T09:58:00.000Z	D-rock		On both laptops
2006-01-10T09:58:00.000Z	D-rock		Is there any way to do a more thorough HD check than just looking at SMART values?
2006-01-10T09:59:00.000Z	psusi	D-rock	yea... run badblocks
2006-01-10T10:01:00.000Z	psusi	D-rock	I think you are barking up the wrong tree.... hard locks are either X lockign up, or something wrong in the kernel... such as a buggy driver... most likely it's X
2006-01-10T10:04:00.000Z	psusi	D-rock	so if you boot into recovery mode and just let it sit there at the prompt, it will eventually lock up?
2006-01-10T10:04:00.000Z	D-rock	psusi	yes
2006-01-10T10:05:00.000Z	psusi	D-rock	any sort of correlation you have noticed?  like it lasts longer after the computer has been off and cold for a while?
2006-01-10T10:06:00.000Z	psusi	D-rock	and have you tried running memtest86?
2006-01-10T10:06:00.000Z	psusi	D-rock	let it run for hours?
2006-01-10T10:06:00.000Z	D-rock	psusi	it's a paperweight if I let it run for hours :)
2006-01-10T10:07:00.000Z	psusi	D-rock	try disabling the nic then... if the nic driver is buggy, it isn't likely that it would allways lock up in the same point during the boot sequence
2006-01-10T10:07:00.000Z	psusi	D-rock	huh?  memtest86 can't run for hours and find no problems?
2006-01-10T10:07:00.000Z	D-rock	psusi	sorry, I thought you meant normal run
2006-01-10T10:14:00.000Z	psusi	D-rock	no... running memtest86... you need to let it run for several hours to be fairly sure you don't have a ram problem
2006-01-10T10:14:00.000Z	psusi	D-rock	yank out the card
