2010-08-18T03:54:00.000Z	H2O		i try to open the update manager
2010-08-18T03:54:00.000Z	H2O		but the system freezes
2010-08-18T03:54:00.000Z	H2O		:(
2010-08-18T03:55:00.000Z	Cryophile	H2O	try an apt-get upgrade if you can
2010-08-18T03:58:00.000Z	H2O	Cryophile	could it be doing this because i installed the 32-bit version, but my processor is 64bit? or this doesn't matter at all?
2010-08-18T04:03:00.000Z	H2O	Cryophile	nope...the screen goes black as soon as i press enter to execute the command... what now?
2010-08-18T04:03:00.000Z	H2O	Cryophile	should i boot in in non-graphic mode?
2010-08-18T04:06:00.000Z	H2O	Cryophile	dead end huh?
2010-08-18T04:08:00.000Z	Cryophile	H2O	i think it's ctrl+alt+F1
2010-08-18T04:08:00.000Z	H2O	Cryophile	nope ;)
2010-08-18T04:11:00.000Z	H2O	Cryophile	what could be the problem? when i log in everything seems cool...whenever i leave the mouse idle for 20 sec. it goes black, whenever i do anything it goes black.... i turned off the screensaver and visual effects and still...
2010-08-18T04:13:00.000Z	H2O	Cryophile	don't know...probably not...it didn't notify me about any restricted drivers on install or after
2010-08-18T04:13:00.000Z	H2O	Cryophile	i'll check now
2010-08-18T04:13:00.000Z	Cryophile	H2O	with it being a fresh install, have you tryed installing again?
2010-08-18T04:23:00.000Z	H2O	Cryophile	how do i know it's healthy
2010-08-18T04:24:00.000Z	H2O	Cryophile	actually now it froze even if i did nothing ;)
2010-08-18T04:27:00.000Z	H2O	Cryophile	maybe...
2010-08-18T04:34:00.000Z	H2O	Cryophile	i'll try installing it on a different partition
2010-08-18T04:34:00.000Z	H2O	Cryophile	although i doubt it'll help
