2006-09-20T07:35:00.000Z	eae		Hey, what's the command for installing programs?
2006-09-20T07:35:00.000Z	eae		Thanks.
2006-09-20T07:36:00.000Z	eae		Ok, guys, another thing. We have a strange way to connect to the wireless in school here. I'd need some help with that, too.
2006-09-20T07:38:00.000Z	eae		Excuse me, I installed a program, but it says command not found when I try to run it by typing the program name?
2006-09-20T07:38:00.000Z	eae		Something else I should type
2006-09-20T07:38:00.000Z	eae		?

2006-09-20T07:39:00.000Z	JoseStefan	eae	try   dpkg -L pingus | grep -i bin
2006-09-20T07:40:00.000Z	eae	JoseStefan	I did that, nothing happened.

2006-09-20T07:40:00.000Z	eae	JoseStefan	then?
2006-09-20T07:41:00.000Z	JoseStefan	eae	see if you can find the binary on the list
2006-09-20T07:41:00.000Z	eae		JoseStefan? I don't think so, I don't know.
2006-09-20T07:42:00.000Z	JoseStefan	eae	could you put the output on the !pastebin
2006-09-20T07:42:00.000Z	eae	JoseStefan	sorry about that.
2006-09-20T07:44:00.000Z	eae		Anyone? I installed pingus and I don't know how to play :(
2006-09-20T07:45:00.000Z	JoseStefan	eae	run this: dpkg -L pingus     and put the output on the pastebin
2006-09-20T07:45:00.000Z	eae	JoseStefan	I got it. I wrote: /usr/games/pingus
