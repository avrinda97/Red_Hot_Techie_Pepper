2009-11-15T09:33:00.000Z	mahngiel	rhorse	and depending on his card chipset, he'll need the drivers
2009-11-15T09:34:00.000Z	mahngiel	rhorse	more than likely 4.150.10.5
2009-11-15T09:34:00.000Z	rhorse	mahngiel	how does he do that?
2009-11-30T22:58:00.000Z	rhorse	mahngiel	how are you doing it in icewm and how in metacity?
2009-11-30T22:58:00.000Z	mahngiel	rhorse	it auto connects in metacity, but doesn't in icewm
2009-11-30T22:59:00.000Z	mahngiel	rhorse	but if i switch to icewm from terminal, i can use it jsut fine
2009-11-30T23:01:00.000Z	mahngiel	rhorse	ya, well, at this point, i just want metacity back to normal. it doesn't seem to be operating right. and i get get gnome-desktop-environment to install. says a dependency is uninstallable
2009-11-30T23:02:00.000Z	rhorse	mahngiel	It's weird because the wifi script should start before the WM does.
2009-11-30T23:03:00.000Z	rhorse	mahngiel	but it's easy to do, once you know how
2009-11-30T23:03:00.000Z	mahngiel	rhorse	well, i'm up sh!t creek right now. i'm just frustrated
2009-11-30T23:04:00.000Z	mahngiel	rhorse	metacity isn't drawing the windows properly. i have no min, max, close buttons, cannot resize, and cannot alt+tab. basically, i'm running a flat win mgr
2009-11-30T23:08:00.000Z	rhorse	mahngiel	just delete the following dir's in your home dir: .gconf, .gnome, .gnome2, .metacity. I think that should bring you to a default state.
2009-11-30T23:09:00.000Z	mahngiel	rhorse	ok, so then when i don't have any wm... what do i do?
2009-11-30T23:09:00.000Z	rhorse	mahngiel	no, that won't harm it. Gnome will create new ones for you.
2009-11-30T23:11:00.000Z	mahngiel	rhorse	i'm just going to uninstall all the other wm's i have first, see if that gets me anywhere
2009-11-30T23:12:00.000Z	rhorse	mahngiel	it sounds like you need to revert to default state. What I said will do that.
2009-11-30T23:12:00.000Z	mahngiel	rhorse	i'll do that momentarily. just as soon as i dump thiss other crap
2009-11-30T23:13:00.000Z	rhorse	mahngiel	good show! Let me know how it worked out.
2009-11-30T23:16:00.000Z	mahngiel	rhorse	okay, del'd all but .metacity, doesn't seem to be in ~ for me. should i restart or update?
2009-11-30T23:17:00.000Z	rhorse	mahngiel	ya, restart the desktop by signing in again. No need to reboot.
2009-11-30T23:24:00.000Z	rhorse	mahngiel	how's it going?
