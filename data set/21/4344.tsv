2008-05-11T07:09:00.000Z	workmaster2n		hey - does anybody know how to activate compiz in hardy?
2008-05-11T07:10:00.000Z	makario	workmaster2n	System > Preferences > Appearance; Visual Effects tab
2008-05-11T07:10:00.000Z	workmaster2n	makario	I'm there
2008-05-11T07:11:00.000Z	makario		Set it to Normal, workmaster2n
2008-05-11T07:11:00.000Z	workmaster2n	makario	ok - it is set to normal
2008-05-11T07:11:00.000Z	makario	workmaster2n	So it's enabled?
2008-05-11T07:12:00.000Z	workmaster2n	makario	- I used compiz in ubuntu 7.10 and there was a place where I could turn features on and off (like the cube and wobbly windows) - how do i access those features?
2008-05-11T07:13:00.000Z	makario	workmaster2n	Install compizconfig-settings-manager through Synaptic for more options.
2008-05-11T07:13:00.000Z	workmaster2n	makario	i can't find that in the package manager
2008-05-11T07:13:00.000Z	makario	workmaster2n	Perhaps I said the wrong name, then. Hold on.
2008-05-11T07:14:00.000Z	makario	workmaster2n	compizconfig-settings-manager is the right name.
2008-05-11T07:14:00.000Z	makario	workmaster2n	Just search for 'compiz settings' in Synaptic.
2008-05-11T07:15:00.000Z	workmaster2n		do I need to enable something in  the synaptic package manager - when I search for compizconfig-settings-manager it does not come up
2008-05-11T07:16:00.000Z	workmaster2n	makario	I searched for compiz settings in synaptic, there is no configuration manager listed for me
2008-05-11T07:16:00.000Z	makario	workmaster2n	What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2008-05-11T07:17:00.000Z	workmaster2n	makario	8.04 Hardy Heron
2008-05-11T07:17:00.000Z	makario	workmaster2n	Is it a fresh install? Have you hit the Reload button in Synaptic yet?
2008-05-11T07:18:00.000Z	workmaster2n	makario	I found my error - I had to hit reload in synaptic
2008-05-11T07:18:00.000Z	workmaster2n	makario	you were exactly right - thank you very much
2008-05-11T07:18:00.000Z	makario	workmaster2n	Install that package, and you'll be able to tweak your settings. (The "Extra" setting in the Visual Effects tab will give you wobbly windows, by the way.)
2008-05-11T07:20:00.000Z	workmaster2n	makario	Thank you!
