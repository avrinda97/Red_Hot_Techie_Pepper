2012-04-26T09:35:00.000Z	iceroot_	z3r0d3rp	yes?
2012-04-26T09:36:00.000Z	iceroot_	z3r0d3rp	upgrade is still different to update from update-manager
2012-04-26T09:36:00.000Z	iceroot_	z3r0d3rp	dist-upgrade would do the same job
2012-04-26T09:42:00.000Z	iceroot_	z3r0d3rp	if you want a rolling release, debian/ubuntu/mint/backtrack is not what you want
2012-04-26T10:16:00.000Z	z3r0d3rp	iceroot_	try deluge
2012-04-26T10:17:00.000Z	iceroot_	z3r0d3rp	thanks, deluge would pull to much for me

2012-04-26T10:20:00.000Z	iceroot_	z3r0d3rp	i only need it for -23 days to provide the ubuntu torrents
