2005-04-07T15:32:00.000Z	dabugas		i have a silly amd at 400-something and gnome works better overall than kde
2005-04-07T15:32:00.000Z	dabugas		but not a fan of either, to be honest
2005-04-07T15:33:00.000Z	dabugas		i was running dvd shrink with wine the other day and it ran better than win xp
2005-04-07T15:34:00.000Z	dabugas		in gnome... that's what i'm interested in :)
2005-04-07T15:36:00.000Z	dabugas		so can anyone help me with my disappeared desktop icon?
2005-04-07T15:37:00.000Z	dabugas		ah.. Xappe... we have the same problem :)
2005-04-07T15:38:00.000Z	Xappe	dabugas	ah, I see. haven't really thought about it, but it came to my mind when they suddenly showed up...
2005-04-07T15:39:00.000Z	dabugas	Xappe	i partially upgraded from warty to hoary; that's when it stopped showing up: on the desktop on places, everywhere
2005-04-07T15:40:00.000Z	dabugas	Xappe	i'm installing the latest nautilus just in case
2005-04-07T15:40:00.000Z	Xappe	dabugas	i've never used warty. upgraded to hoary right away in november, and now i have a fresh install from array 7
2005-04-07T15:41:00.000Z	Xappe	dabugas	fresh and daily updated that is
2005-04-08T16:00:00.000Z	dabugas		hi
2005-04-08T16:00:00.000Z	dabugas	Xappe	bullshit.
2005-04-08T16:01:00.000Z	Xappe	dabugas	no luck?
2005-04-08T16:01:00.000Z	dabugas	Xappe	no luck at all :(
2005-04-08T16:02:00.000Z	dabugas	Xappe	how does nautilus know which drives to show?
2005-04-08T16:03:00.000Z	Xappe	dabugas	it should show things mounted in /media
2005-04-08T16:03:00.000Z	dabugas		the ones that are shown are my cdrom & floppy which are cdrom0 and floppy0 which link back to cdrom and floppy
2005-04-08T16:03:00.000Z	dabugas	Xappe	my windows drive is in media :(
2005-04-08T16:04:00.000Z	Xappe	dabugas	so are my mounted partitions, and they do not show up in Places either
2005-04-08T16:05:00.000Z	dabugas	Xappe	daaaamn :(
