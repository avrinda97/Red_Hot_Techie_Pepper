2008-12-11T05:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MttJocy	Can we see your sources.list
2008-12-11T05:42:00.000Z	MttJocy	Jack_Sparrow	Why?
2008-12-11T05:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MttJocy	Can we see your sources.list .................to try and see why you have a problem..    also from a term.. please tell us exactly what lsb_release -a    tells you
2008-12-11T05:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MttJocy	And please use the pastebin and dont paste into the channel
2008-12-11T05:44:00.000Z	MttJocy	Jack_Sparrow	The point is that the synaptic install worked fine, until the app was run then it saw an updated version on the azureus site and tried to self update (not through synaptic) because it is configured to do that in the package from synaptic
2008-12-11T05:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MttJocy	   The whole point is.. that you manually changed and added repos...   and now have a problem
2008-12-11T05:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MttJocy	  also from a term.. please tell us exactly what lsb_release -a    tells you
2008-12-11T05:46:00.000Z	MttJocy	Jack_Sparrow	Interpid 8.10, I could have told you that though
2008-12-11T06:05:00.000Z	MttJocy	Jack_Sparrow	Huh?
2008-12-11T06:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MttJocy	Sorry, that was probably not right
2008-12-11T06:07:00.000Z	MttJocy	Jack_Sparrow	Not quite sure that is what I was looking for, I just want to tell synaptic to hold off updating azureus unless I manually go into synaptic and say otherwise (keep it out of the update manager thing) or better if possible tell it not to update it if the package is bellow version 4.0.0.4
2008-12-11T06:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MttJocy	Pinning will lock the current app..
2008-12-11T06:08:00.000Z	MttJocy	Jack_Sparrow	Ah, I think I might have found something that might work in synaptic I found Package -> Lock Version
2008-12-11T06:08:00.000Z	MttJocy	Jack_Sparrow	I assume now synaptic wont try to update it now?
2008-12-11T06:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MttJocy	Did you read about pinning
2008-12-11T06:10:00.000Z	MttJocy	Jack_Sparrow	Actually no I just noticed it in Syanptic, that pinning thing I thought was something else, it talked about different distributions of Ubuntu and stuff :s
2008-12-11T06:11:00.000Z	MttJocy	Jack_Sparrow	Right OK, all I want it to do is leave the new Azureus2.jar and /usr/bin/azureus I just modified stay put :|
2008-12-11T06:12:00.000Z	MttJocy	Jack_Sparrow	And I locked the version so it is safe now right?
2008-12-11T06:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MttJocy	It should be.. but since you added repos and such, I cant be 100% sure
2008-12-11T06:13:00.000Z	MttJocy	Jack_Sparrow	I don't recall saying I had done that, but yeah I did put medibuntu on
2008-12-11T06:13:00.000Z	MttJocy	Jack_Sparrow	Needed it for libdvdcss
