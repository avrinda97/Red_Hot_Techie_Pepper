2012-07-28T23:03:00.000Z	rodneymillerpca		To me it loks like a bloated 800x600
2012-07-28T23:03:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	1024x768 is kinda tiny for a desktop resolution by today's standards, I'd kinda expect ubuntu to look a little off
2012-07-28T23:05:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	1024x768 *IS* 4:3
2012-07-28T23:05:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	it's an aspect ratio. Key word here being RATIO. 256*4 = 1024, 256*3 = 768
2012-07-28T23:07:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	think of aspect ratios like classes of resolutions that are different sizes but the same shape
2012-07-28T23:09:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	what were you running before?
2012-07-28T23:17:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	did you resize it?
2012-07-28T23:18:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	nevermind, I figured it out
2012-07-28T23:19:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	Well, you're getting 1024x768, and that's just how big things are in 1024x768. What kind of monitor are you using?
2012-07-28T23:21:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	did anything change since you installed the previous version?
2012-07-28T23:21:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	it looks like it's not getting EDID for some reason
2012-07-28T23:24:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	You don't get any larger options than 1024x768?
2012-07-28T23:26:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	so you used 1024x768 in 11.10?
2012-07-28T23:28:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	well, that's just how big things are at 1024x768, by default at least. You could try playing with icon size and what not
2012-07-28T23:32:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	the thing is, Ubuntu is optimized for typical screen sizes of today, which tend to start at 1366x768 and only go up. 1024x768 is rather small.
2012-07-28T23:33:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	Well hey, how big is your current monitor anyway? Like physically, in inches
2012-07-28T23:36:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	17" is *tiny*. You can't even get a new monitor smaller than 19" today.
2012-07-28T23:37:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	Another theory: Ubuntu wasn't respecting the DPI from the EDID in 11.10 and now it is, and now things are the "right" size on your itty bitty monitor
2012-07-28T23:45:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	Just open a terminal and type it in
2012-07-28T23:59:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	That's a good thing, that's a confirmation that Ubuntu is getting the EDID
2012-07-29T00:00:00.000Z	roothorick	rodneymillerpca	switch to the biggest resolution it offers you
