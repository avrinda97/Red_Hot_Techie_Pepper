2011-06-26T00:07:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	dr_willis	do you know whether you can adjust the width of the conky toolbar?
2011-06-26T00:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kuehlschrank	 conky is cofigurable.. so thats a yes.
2011-06-26T00:09:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	dr_willis	I'll take a look at the manual...later on. :)
2011-06-26T00:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kuehlschrank	 plan on spending a few days
2011-06-26T00:10:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	dr_willis	I already did my own conky-setup but the toolbar's just too wide
2011-06-26T00:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kuehlschrank	 minimum_size 180 500
2011-06-26T00:11:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	dr_willis	mine is about 3 inch
2011-06-26T00:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kuehlschrank	 so start the thing... load the conkyrc file in an editor.. make changes.. save it.. conky should see the change and restart using the new config... repeate till its how you want
2011-06-26T00:13:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	dr_willis	I'll do so... thanks.
2011-06-26T00:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kuehlschrank	 thats a relatively new feature in conky also.. it now sees/reloads its config on the fly.
2011-06-26T00:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kuehlschrank	 makes it a lot easier to tweak
2011-06-26T00:14:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	dr_willis	I know. This is grat.
2011-06-26T00:14:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	dr_willis	*great
2011-06-26T00:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kuehlschrank	 but 90% of the time. i do my work in fullscreened windows.. so i rarely see my conky thangs
2011-06-26T00:15:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	dr_willis	me too, but it's always nice too enjoy booting up and looking at the self-made super-sidebar
2011-06-26T00:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kuehlschrank	 my main conky thing is a simple config i made ages ago that just shows a calander widgit. :) thats it.. nothing fancy
2011-08-10T22:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kuehlschrank	 i thinkyou need to use a 'tee' to get sudo to echo into a file properly...
2011-08-10T22:02:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	dr_willis	for me it always worked this way..
2011-08-10T22:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kuehlschrank	 echo "foo" | sudo tee /root/somefile
2011-08-10T22:03:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	dr_willis	the *right* way =)
2011-08-10T22:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kuehlschrank	 well this definatly dont work --> sudo echo "foo" > /root/somefile
