2009-03-04T23:44:00.000Z	masu3701	LjL	i cant even go into recovery mode because i commanded how those ligns in the mune list file
2009-03-04T23:44:00.000Z	LjL	masu3701	that was a terrible idea
2009-03-04T23:44:00.000Z	LjL	masu3701	anyway, you can still do it
2009-03-04T23:45:00.000Z	masu3701	LjL	i can still edit the file?
2009-03-04T23:45:00.000Z	LjL	masu3701	when in the boot menu, just hit "e". you'll see a list of lines, hit "e" again, that'll let you edit the first line. to the end of it, add: init=/bin/sh
2009-03-04T23:45:00.000Z	LjL	masu3701	the press Enter, then press "b" to boot. you should be taken to a root shell.
2009-03-04T23:47:00.000Z	masu3701	LjL	i have windown and ubuntu...so boot into ubuntu then hit e?
2009-03-04T23:48:00.000Z	LjL	masu3701	no
2009-03-04T23:48:00.000Z	LjL	masu3701	in the *menu* -- the very same menu that should have had a recovery mode option, but didn't -- hit "e"
2009-03-04T23:49:00.000Z	masu3701		ok
2009-03-04T23:49:00.000Z	LjL	masu3701	after having selected the Ubuntu line, but that's normally the default
2009-03-04T23:49:00.000Z	masu3701	LjL	: wait..in that menu i only have windows and ubuntu
2009-03-04T23:49:00.000Z	masu3701		suppose to have the recovery mode but its out
2009-03-04T23:50:00.000Z	LjL	masu3701	yes, so select ubuntu (unless it's already selected by default), then hit "e"
2009-03-04T23:50:00.000Z	masu3701		ok
2009-03-04T23:50:00.000Z	LjL	masu3701	then hit "e" again, then type " init=/bin/sh" without the quotes, then hit Enter, then hit "b"
2009-03-04T23:50:00.000Z	masu3701		so hit e after select ubuntu
2009-03-04T23:50:00.000Z	masu3701		ok
2009-03-04T23:51:00.000Z	LjL		!pt | g69
2009-03-04T23:51:00.000Z	masu3701	LjL	so reboot after the entering "b"
2009-03-04T23:52:00.000Z	LjL	masu3701	no, after "b", you should wait for it to *boot*, then when you get a shell, you type "adduser mchris admin". THEN you reboot.
