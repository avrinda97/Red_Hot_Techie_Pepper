2006-03-04T14:35:00.000Z	Mantice		Thanks Madpilot
2006-03-04T14:36:00.000Z	Mantice		I guess nothing in the rest of my linux life will be harder than installing ati drivers :)
2006-03-04T14:36:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 it ain't that hard
2006-03-04T14:37:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 it ain't hard. just edit kernel, then install the drivers, edit your xorg.conf and you're done
2006-03-04T14:44:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 it sure is :/
2006-03-04T14:45:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 so not true. besides, kde ain't good, imho
2006-03-04T14:50:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 fluxbox ownz it all
2006-03-04T14:52:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 if you don't know how to treat windows, it sure will break. so will linux
2006-03-04T14:53:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 then one wouldn't have to re-install win often
2006-03-04T14:54:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 and why?
2006-03-04T14:54:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 have a backup on a fresh installment = no need for a new install if(when) you break things
2006-03-04T15:07:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 just install the right kernel :P
2006-03-04T15:08:00.000Z	Mantice	pontusen	I thought amd64 was the right kernel
2006-03-04T15:08:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 if you installed 64bits ubuntu, then you need amd64 kernel. however, you can emulate 32bits
2006-03-04T15:09:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 "it"?
2006-03-04T15:09:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 hmm, don't know with ubuntu, try look for a 32-bits emulator in synaptic?
2006-03-04T15:10:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 at least check the synaptic for some 32-bits emulator
2006-03-04T15:27:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 gaim or game?
2006-03-04T15:34:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 have ff as your default browser?
2006-03-04T15:34:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 you got it?
2006-03-04T15:35:00.000Z	pontusen	Mantice	 edit -> preferrences -> check now
