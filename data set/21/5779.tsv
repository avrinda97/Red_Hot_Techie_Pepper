2007-08-09T08:33:00.000Z	jrib	sanguisde2	auto-apt is supposed to, but what are you compiling?
2007-08-09T08:34:00.000Z	sanguisde2	jrib	battle for wesnoth
2007-08-09T08:35:00.000Z	jrib	sanguisde2	that's packaged in ubuntu, no need to compile
2007-08-09T08:35:00.000Z	sanguisde2	jrib	but I cant play online w/ it becase I have an old ver
2007-08-09T08:36:00.000Z	sanguisde2	jrib	the packaged ver is a few vers behind
2007-08-09T08:36:00.000Z	jrib	sanguisde2	which version do you need? 1.2.5 is in backports
2007-08-09T08:37:00.000Z	sanguisde2	jrib	well I was going for w1.2.6 casue that is what every one else on my net work has
2007-08-09T08:38:00.000Z	jrib	sanguisde2	ok, well this command will install the dependencies you need to build the package in the repositories (which should be the same as 1.2.6):  sudo apt-get build-dep wesnoth
2007-08-09T08:40:00.000Z	sanguisde2	jrib	I will try it and report back
2007-08-09T08:42:00.000Z	sanguisde2	jrib	I still cant find the libSDL_IMAGE even though the package mager says its installed
2007-08-09T08:43:00.000Z	jrib	sanguisde2	libsdl-image1.2-dev is installed?
2007-08-09T08:43:00.000Z	jrib	sanguisde2	try 'make clean' and then running ./configure again?
2007-08-09T08:46:00.000Z	sanguisde2	jrib	 I am getting  "make: *** No rule to make target `clean'.  Stop."
2007-08-09T08:48:00.000Z	jrib	sanguisde2	I don't know why ./configure doesn't find libsdl-image then.  What version does the README say it needs?
2007-08-09T08:50:00.000Z	sanguisde2	jrib	libsdl-image1.2
2007-08-09T08:51:00.000Z	jrib	sanguisde2	do 'apt-get source wesnoth' and see if *that* compiles (for troubleshooting purposes)
2007-08-09T08:52:00.000Z	sanguisde2	jrib	doing that
2007-08-09T09:22:00.000Z	jrib	sanguisde2	I don't understand your question
2007-08-09T09:24:00.000Z	sanguisde2	jrib	I have used the the package manger to install all the libs I am suposed to need but then I go to compile and the ./configre script cant find the program it needs, so I install it manualy from source, and the configure file can find the software
2007-08-09T09:26:00.000Z	sanguisde2	jrib	so the querstion is why does the package manager install thing in non standard locations that the ./configure scripts cant find
2007-08-09T09:26:00.000Z	jrib	sanguisde2	join me in #ubuntu-classroom please
