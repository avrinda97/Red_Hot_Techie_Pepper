2007-05-01T08:21:00.000Z	aterphasma		is there any particular reason X doesn't start on the 7.04 livecd?
2007-05-01T08:21:00.000Z	crdlb	aterphasma	does it in safe graphics mode?
2007-05-01T08:21:00.000Z	crdlb	aterphasma	 do you have a new ati card?
2007-05-01T08:21:00.000Z	aterphasma	crdlb	hmm... good question, and yes
2007-05-01T08:23:00.000Z	aterphasma	crdlb	yes, as in i do have an ati x1600, and good question to whether safe mode graphics work or not
2007-05-01T08:23:00.000Z	crdlb	aterphasma	yeah there's lots of issues with new ati cards
2007-05-01T08:24:00.000Z	aterphasma	crdlb	i've noticed... would've gotten an nvidia if i'd realized the drivers suck so much
2007-05-01T08:25:00.000Z	crdlb	aterphasma	if you install into safe graphics mode, then enable the restricted driver, you may be OK
2007-05-01T08:25:00.000Z	aterphasma	crdlb	i also have fail after installing xorg-driver-fglrx (or however it happens to be spelled)
2007-05-01T08:25:00.000Z	aterphasma	crdlb	and subsequently editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-05-01T08:25:00.000Z	crdlb	aterphasma	did you try using the restricted manager?
2007-05-01T08:26:00.000Z	aterphasma	crdlb	i assume that's something or other in safe graphics mode, yes?
2007-05-01T08:26:00.000Z	crdlb	aterphasma	it's ubuntu's installer for fglrx
2007-05-01T08:26:00.000Z	crdlb	aterphasma	system>adminstration>restricted manager
2007-05-01T08:26:00.000Z	aterphasma	crdlb	let me restart and see if i can get in with safe graphics mode, i'll probably be back (and thanks for helping)
2007-05-01T08:38:00.000Z	aterphasma	crdlb	safe graphics mode doesn't let me get into X
2007-05-01T08:39:00.000Z	crdlb	aterphasma	then you'd have to use the alternate cd
2007-05-01T08:39:00.000Z	aterphasma	crdlb	i tried, but the alternate CD is just as broken as the livecd
2007-05-01T08:39:00.000Z	crdlb	aterphasma	can you believe that card is so crappy that it doesn't support vesa?
2007-05-01T08:40:00.000Z	aterphasma	crdlb	it supports it under every other release of ubuntu i've ever used
2007-05-01T08:40:00.000Z	crdlb	aterphasma	I don't know then
