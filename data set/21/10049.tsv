2005-09-06T06:18:00.000Z	robertj		anyone here have a G5 with breezy and usplash working properly?
2005-09-06T06:19:00.000Z	nalioth	robertj	i'm happy my G5 is running hoary
2005-09-06T06:20:00.000Z	robertj	nalioth	hehe, I don't get any work done in Linux on my desktop so I run breezy ;)
2005-09-06T06:20:00.000Z	robertj	nalioth	I do however have two stable servers though with hoary so I don't feel all dirty inside ;)
2005-09-06T06:21:00.000Z	nalioth	robertj	i can't get ANY linux to load onto my imac G5
2005-09-06T06:21:00.000Z	robertj	nalioth	have you tried a breezy nightly?
2005-09-06T06:22:00.000Z	nalioth	robertj	yes, and it was an adventure. it wanst seen as "bootable" by the machine, and when i restarted in OSX, it kernel panicked it immediately. hadda go to OF to eject the thing
2005-09-06T06:23:00.000Z	robertj	nalioth	Hrmm, dunno.
2005-09-06T06:24:00.000Z	nalioth	robertj	too late
2005-09-06T06:29:00.000Z	nalioth	robertj	i'm runnin a dual 1.8 and i have 0 problems
2005-09-06T06:29:00.000Z	nalioth	robertj	the 1.6 was the first model, and has "original model year bugs"
2005-09-06T06:29:00.000Z	robertj	nalioth	good for you, I've got 100 macs with no problems and 30 with severe problems.
2005-09-06T06:30:00.000Z	nalioth	robertj	are you a sysadmin in heaven?
2005-09-06T06:30:00.000Z	robertj	nalioth	a 50+% mortality rate on motherboard/cpu in the first year is a bit more than a bug
2005-09-06T06:30:00.000Z	nalioth	robertj	well then, i'm past that (bought a apple warranted refurb)
2005-09-06T06:31:00.000Z	robertj	nalioth	AppleCare IMO is pretty good, but if they don't comp us another 2 years of AppleCare on the 1.6's it may be the last Mac lab we have
2005-09-06T06:33:00.000Z	nalioth	robertj	really. . . .
2005-09-06T06:34:00.000Z	nalioth	robertj	my DP1.8 is amazingly faster than my G3 and G4 ibooks (both maxxed with ram)
2005-09-06T06:34:00.000Z	nalioth	robertj	emachine? we are comparing apples and prunes now?
2005-09-06T06:36:00.000Z	nalioth	robertj	i have a new logic board, heh heh
2005-10-18T10:14:00.000Z	nalioth	robertj	that happens next week
