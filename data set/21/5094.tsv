2007-12-31T22:03:00.000Z	biff420	murf	did you try going to system>admin>sounds to see which driver you are using?
2007-12-31T22:05:00.000Z	murf		biif420: Hi Biff... I don't seem to have a sounds option under admin... there is Sounds under preferences is that it?
2007-12-31T22:05:00.000Z	biff420	murf	yes, sorry thats ti
2007-12-31T22:06:00.000Z	murf	biff420	It says AUtodetect under most settings...Default Mixer Tracks Device is blank with no available options
2007-12-31T22:07:00.000Z	biff420	murf	sounds like you don't have a driver installed
2007-12-31T22:08:00.000Z	biff420	murf	go here for the latest driver for your card http://opensource.creative.com/
2007-12-31T22:08:00.000Z	murf	biff420	Thanks I'll check it out... any trick to installing the drivers?
2007-12-31T22:08:00.000Z	biff420	murf	unfornunately, i think you will have to compile one from source unless you can find a .deb out there
2007-12-31T22:08:00.000Z	biff420	murf	what version of ubuntu are you running?
2007-12-31T22:09:00.000Z	murf	biff420	7.10
2007-12-31T22:09:00.000Z	biff420	murf	32 bit i assume?
2007-12-31T22:09:00.000Z	murf	biff420	yes
2007-12-31T22:10:00.000Z	biff420	murf	check out that site...there should be a readme on how to install them
2007-12-31T22:10:00.000Z	murf	biff420	thanks again... just looking at the site now.
2007-12-31T22:12:00.000Z	biff420	murf	creatives main site has the drivers as well
2007-12-31T22:13:00.000Z	biff420	murf	us.creative.com
2007-12-31T22:16:00.000Z	murf	biff420	Just looking at the Creative site now.. the only driver I can see for the X-Fi is a 64bit beta driver.  I can't see any mention of a 32bit version.
2007-12-31T22:16:00.000Z	biff420	murf	wierd...thats all i saw too...of course im running 64 bit so i figured it detected that when i clicked on the link
2007-12-31T22:17:00.000Z	biff420	murf	i don think it matters since it appears to be a source package...when you install it will compile it of your system so 64 or 32 bit should work
2007-12-31T22:18:00.000Z	murf	biff420	I'll give it a hook and see what happens... d/ling now
2007-12-31T22:18:00.000Z	biff420	murf	good luck...i'll bet the readme is decent enough to follow for the install
