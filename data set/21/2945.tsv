2009-06-21T21:13:00.000Z	boss_mc	newbie002	did you pass -p blah as an argument to ssh?
2009-06-21T21:13:00.000Z	newbie002	boss_mc	no, I was never given a password, just a file, I also gave my public key file
2009-06-21T21:14:00.000Z	boss_mc	newbie002	because it sounds like you've made the ssh connection to the machine and now the machine is allowing you to log on (but you need a username/password for that)
2009-06-21T21:15:00.000Z	newbie002	boss_mc	yes that is what I'm thinking, can I show you my ssh -v?
2009-06-21T21:15:00.000Z	boss_mc	newbie002	sure... pastebiniot

2009-06-21T21:18:00.000Z	boss_mc	newbie002	do you have a username/password for that box?
2009-06-21T21:19:00.000Z	newbie002	boss_mc	no, that's why I'm confused
2009-06-21T21:19:00.000Z	boss_mc	newbie002	you'll need one, the public key is just to allow you to make the connection, you still need a user/pass to log in to the machine
2009-06-21T21:19:00.000Z	newbie002	boss_mc	could it be that I should enter my passphrase? I created a passphrase when I generated the public key
2009-06-21T21:20:00.000Z	boss_mc	newbie002	same as if you were sitting at the machine
2009-06-21T21:20:00.000Z	newbie002	boss_mc	the guy who gave me the access doesn't seem to think that, so I thought I was doing something wrong on my end
2009-06-21T21:20:00.000Z	boss_mc	newbie002	I'm testing on my machine... gimmie a sec...
2009-06-21T21:21:00.000Z	newbie002	boss_mc	thanks
2009-06-21T22:54:00.000Z	boss_mc	newbie002	are you running off the unetbootin usb?
2009-06-21T22:55:00.000Z	boss_mc	newbie002	cos unetbootin doesn't add the memtest option...
2009-06-21T22:56:00.000Z	boss_mc	newbie002	you can add it yourself by translating the livecd's menu.lst section to the usb's equivalent
2009-06-21T22:56:00.000Z	newbie002	boss_mc	I see
2009-06-21T22:57:00.000Z	boss_mc	newbie002	unfortunately I don't have a usb to work with so I can't give you the specifics but it's fairly simple tbh
2009-06-21T22:58:00.000Z	boss_mc	newbie002	memtest runs a series of tests on your RAM, and warns if it is damaged
2009-06-21T22:58:00.000Z	boss_mc	newbie002	it's often a good test to run if a PC is failing to boot
