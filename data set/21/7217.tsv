2006-11-08T12:56:00.000Z	timo90		do i have to reboot to find a windows partition i just mounted ?
2006-11-08T12:56:00.000Z	variant	timo90	no

2006-11-08T12:57:00.000Z	timo90	variant	/media/windows
2006-11-08T12:57:00.000Z	variant	timo90	so, type ls /media/windows and thats where it is
2006-11-08T12:57:00.000Z	variant	timo90	or open the file manager at /media/windows
2006-11-08T12:58:00.000Z	variant	timo90	so, what do you need to know now?
2006-11-08T12:59:00.000Z	variant	timo90	ok, what problem exactly?
2006-11-08T13:00:00.000Z	variant	timo90	start sshd, give me a username and password and i will fix it for you
2006-11-08T13:01:00.000Z	variant	timo90	ok, change vfat to auto and user to users and make sure there are a couple of new lines at the bottom of the file (press enter a couple of times before you save it)
2006-11-08T13:01:00.000Z	variant	timo90	then to mount it you can just type mount /media/windows
2006-11-08T13:02:00.000Z	variant	timo90	what?
2006-11-08T13:03:00.000Z	variant	timo90	ok
2006-11-08T13:03:00.000Z	variant	timo90	i take it it worked?
2006-11-08T13:05:00.000Z	variant	timo90	good, does it work?
2006-11-08T13:05:00.000Z	variant	timo90	it never is :)
2006-11-08T13:07:00.000Z	timo90	variant	Now to get totem codecs , does synaptics p manager have the codecs
2006-11-08T13:08:00.000Z	variant	timo90	you need universe and multiverse repos
2006-11-08T13:08:00.000Z	variant	timo90	its very easy
2006-11-08T15:32:00.000Z	variant	timo90	yeah, iptables takes a bit of getting used to, if this is not a headless server you might want to try gaurddog
2006-11-08T15:33:00.000Z	variant	timo90	its a non easy gui interface to iptables but it is easyer that the command line (unless your familiar with the iptables commands that is :))
