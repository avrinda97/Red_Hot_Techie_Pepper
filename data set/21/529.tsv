2011-10-29T04:24:00.000Z	dardevelin		so just remember if she decides to whip windows she will need to reinstall ubuntu
2011-10-29T04:24:00.000Z	dardevelin		can't expand
2011-10-29T04:25:00.000Z	dardevelin		while if she installs along side . Its possible to whip windows without reinstalling
2011-10-29T04:25:00.000Z	dardevelin		it's
2011-10-29T04:25:00.000Z	dardevelin		Ubuntu installer menu actually have an option ( install along side windows ) so should be really easy
2011-10-29T04:26:00.000Z	matlock	dardevelin	and btw, it's kinda hard to brick an hdd
2011-10-29T04:26:00.000Z	matlock		unless you drop it
2011-10-29T04:26:00.000Z	matlock		shouldn't use that term
2011-10-29T04:26:00.000Z	matlock		cause it's easily recoverable
2011-10-29T04:26:00.000Z	dardevelin		btw if she is like a newb in general in computing even ubuntu might not be the choice, and be more like mint
2011-10-29T04:27:00.000Z	dardevelin	matlock	if you screw the master boot record the drive doesn't even get recognized by the computer
2011-10-29T04:27:00.000Z	matlock		no
2011-10-29T04:27:00.000Z	matlock		you're wrong
2011-10-29T04:27:00.000Z	dardevelin	matlock	so its bricked
2011-10-29T04:27:00.000Z	matlock		simply wrong
2011-10-29T04:27:00.000Z	matlock		if you screw with the mbr, it simply won't look to that drive to boot
2011-10-29T04:27:00.000Z	matlock		it will give you an error about missing os
2011-10-29T04:27:00.000Z	matlock		but it will still see the drive
2011-10-29T04:27:00.000Z	matlock		you should really learn up on pc's before giving advice
2011-10-29T04:28:00.000Z	dardevelin	matlock	specially laptops hang on the bios if the mbr is screw
