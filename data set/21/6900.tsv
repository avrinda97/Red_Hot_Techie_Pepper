2007-01-12T09:43:00.000Z	subzero800		anyone: how do i add another resolution option for my monitor?
2007-01-12T09:43:00.000Z	Hansel	subzero800	- edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-01-12T09:44:00.000Z	Hansel	subzero800	for example "1600x1200", "1024x768", "800x600"
2007-01-12T09:48:00.000Z	subzero800	Hansel	look at this, where do i edit it, (by the way I added those 1280x1024 sections) http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/1257/
2007-01-12T09:57:00.000Z	subzero800	Hansel	lol, got it, but how do i paste the modline there?
2007-01-12T09:58:00.000Z	Hansel	subzero800	- get to an xterm and type sudo pico /etc/X11/xorg.conf  (you might want to cp xorg.conf to xorg.conf.backup just incase)
2007-01-12T09:58:00.000Z	subzero800	Hansel	I did...1280x1024...wont show up
2007-01-12T10:14:00.000Z	Hansel	subzero800	- did you set it as the first resolution in the list?
2007-01-12T10:14:00.000Z	Hansel	subzero800	- if not you have to use a tool to switch between the resolutions.
2007-01-12T10:14:00.000Z	subzero800	Hansel	yeah
2007-01-12T10:15:00.000Z	Hansel	subzero800	- that generally means your monitor doesnt support a resolution that high then.  :(
2007-01-12T10:15:00.000Z	Hansel	subzero800	- can you pastebin your current config so I can look it over?
2007-01-12T10:17:00.000Z	subzero800	Hansel	sure, just so you know i have a 15.4 inch widescreen thats 1280x800, and the external hooked up that's 1280x1024, i dont care what it is on the widescreen
2007-01-12T10:19:00.000Z	Hansel	subzero800	in your Section "Screen" that begins on line 136 in that pastebin URL try adding "1024x768" as the last option...
2007-01-12T10:20:00.000Z	subzero800	Hansel	and every line after starting with 143 right?
2007-01-12T10:21:00.000Z	Hansel	subzero800	as a last resort 1024x768 will work 99.9% of the time incase your monitor cant handle the higher res  :)
2007-01-12T10:21:00.000Z	subzero800	Hansel	its in 1024x768
2007-01-12T10:22:00.000Z	subzero800	Hansel	well im in XGL
2007-01-12T10:24:00.000Z	subzero800	Hansel	so any ideas?
2007-01-12T10:24:00.000Z	Hansel	subzero800	- running out of 'em.  :(  maybe #ubuntu-xgl?
2007-01-12T10:35:00.000Z	subzero800	Hansel	you here?
