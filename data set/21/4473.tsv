2010-09-23T00:41:00.000Z	whosjose		how to switch from ubuntu to windows xp? I get an error unknown device and I used a liveCD to gpart to fat32 and ntfs. What else do i might need to do?
2010-09-23T00:43:00.000Z	whosjose		using the livecd?
2010-09-23T00:43:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	If you want to remove Ubuntu and install XP, you just need to put in the XP cd, delete all the partitions, and make a new NTFS or FAT to install to.
2010-09-23T00:43:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	Why not?
2010-09-23T00:44:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	Well, then nothing you can do in GParted will fix that
2010-09-23T00:46:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	Do you get to the point from the install CD that lets you set up partitions?
2010-09-23T00:47:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	Then it may be the CD you're using. Is it scratched up or dirty?
2010-09-23T00:47:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	Give me a minute to google that error code, and I'll see...
2010-09-23T00:49:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	According to Microsoft's website, that error happens when the boot device can't be accessed... In other words, the CD can't read itself...
2010-09-23T00:49:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	My guess is that it's a misconfiguration/bug in your BIOS
2010-09-23T00:50:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	Well, could it be a bad burn then? Did you check the MD5 of the ISO and compare it to the MD5 of the CD?
2010-09-23T00:51:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	I mean the MD5 of the CD itself, not just what the MD5 of the ISO is supposed to be (though you should check that, too).
2010-09-23T00:52:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	Also, I'm going to assume that this is a legal copy that you downloaded from MSDN's student downloads or something like that, but if it happens to be an illegal copy, you may want to check your source
2010-09-23T00:53:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	Have you tried it in another computer (don't install it, just boot)
2010-09-23T00:54:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	Must be. New CD-ROM hardware might not work in XP
2010-09-23T00:55:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	I think there is some way to install XP from a thumb drive, but I have no idea...
2010-09-23T00:55:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	Or maybe you could try a USB CD-ROM drive if you have one handy
2010-09-23T00:57:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	Ah, this must be the problem:  >>OerHeks: undecim, if it is a sata disk, xp won't work, ..
2010-09-23T00:57:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	If you're laptop was made for Vista/7, it's probably a sata disk
2010-09-23T00:57:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	check your bios for IDE Legacy mode
2010-09-23T00:58:00.000Z	undecim	whosjose	Or something like that... basically to make SATA drives act like IDE drives
