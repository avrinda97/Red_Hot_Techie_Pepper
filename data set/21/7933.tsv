2006-07-01T11:28:00.000Z	efox	wastrel	i looked up scp, however reading a few sites, it doesnt specify what port it uses
2006-07-01T11:29:00.000Z	wastrel	efox	 it's the ssh port, 22
2006-07-01T11:29:00.000Z	efox	wastrel	gotcha. which can also be changed if need be correct ?
2006-07-01T11:30:00.000Z	wastrel	efox	 the remote server would need be listening on the different port.  but yes.
