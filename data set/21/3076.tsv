2009-11-05T03:16:00.000Z	KerrMD		Silly question folks. How would I go about connecting to my router via ethernet instead of wireless. I cannot seem to do it wirelessly.
2009-11-05T03:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	KerrMD	you sure you're using the right address.. typically 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1
2009-11-05T03:18:00.000Z	KerrMD	Scunizi	it should actually be 192.168.2.1 if you are refering to the gateway
2009-11-05T03:19:00.000Z	KerrMD	Scunizi	The thing is that in the network manager I have no option to create a new wired connection
2009-11-05T03:19:00.000Z	Scunizi	KerrMD	yep.. with x.x.2.1 that means you or someone has changed it from default
2009-11-05T03:19:00.000Z	KerrMD	Scunizi	No, that is the default for Belkin routers
2009-11-05T03:19:00.000Z	Scunizi	KerrMD	new to me.. so are you trying to disconnect wireless and connect with wired?
2009-11-05T03:20:00.000Z	KerrMD	Scunizi	I cannot connect with wireless. It cycles through asking for my key. I provide the correct one but does not want to connect. I was hoping that if I could connect via eth that I could update and work out the problem a bit easier
2009-11-05T03:21:00.000Z	Scunizi	KerrMD	sure.. all you have to do is plug in the wire.. then right mouse click the network icon up by the clock and turn off wireless.. it should automatically request dhcp
2009-11-05T03:22:00.000Z	KerrMD	Scunizi	I cannot even ping 192.168.2.1 even after disabling the wireless
2009-11-05T03:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	KerrMD	in the same area.. disable all networking .. wait for a few seconds then reenable networking without ticking the wireless box.. give it a little time and it should connect.. that is unless you've set a static ip for that machine that is outside the subnet
2009-11-05T03:25:00.000Z	KerrMD	Scunizi	No, no static ip's are set. Will give it a go
2009-11-05T03:26:00.000Z	KerrMD	Scunizi	Seems to be a no go
2009-11-05T03:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	KerrMD	strange.. sorry I'm not sure where to go from here.
2009-11-05T03:27:00.000Z	KerrMD	Scunizi	I am not even sure I see the eth in an lspci. I see the wifi but cannot see what should be a network adapter for eth
2009-11-05T03:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	KerrMD	maybe it's turned off in bios?
2009-11-05T03:32:00.000Z	KerrMD	Scunizi	Thanks, I had completely forgotten that I disabled it in bios. Sheesh
2009-11-05T03:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	KerrMD	sometimes it's the simplest things :)
2009-11-05T03:37:00.000Z	KerrMD	Scunizi	It's like my A+ teacher said way back when. (KISS) Keep it simple stupid
2009-11-05T03:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	KerrMD	yep
2009-11-05T03:38:00.000Z	KerrMD	Scunizi	Now to get these updates done and see if I can get this bloody BCM4328 to connect to my wireless network. A grounded laptop is not cool.
