2011-03-24T21:29:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	blubb	did you try "startx" at the shell?
2011-03-24T21:30:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	blubb	I should ask, which version are you using?
2011-03-24T21:30:00.000Z	blubb		10.10
2011-03-24T21:30:00.000Z	blubb		no√º
2011-03-24T21:30:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	blubb	ubuntu, kubuntu, etc., server/desktop/netbook etc.
2011-03-24T21:30:00.000Z	blubb		*nope its a busybox terminal, the kernel panics. ubuntu desktop
2011-03-24T21:32:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	blubb	So to recap: your computer was in suspend mode and hte battery died, and now you cannot boot it at all. You were using the standard, plain vanilla Ubuntu Desktop (GNOME). Trying to run startx causes the kernel to panic. Does that sum it up?
2011-03-24T21:32:00.000Z	blubb		<econdudeawesome> nope.
2011-03-24T21:33:00.000Z	blubb		<econdudeawesome> my computer was going into hibernate and battery died. upon booting, the kernel cannot mount my root file system and does therefore not find /sbin/init.
2011-03-24T21:33:00.000Z	blubb		<econdudeawesome> and therefore kernel panics.
2011-03-24T21:34:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	blubb	got it. This is out of my expertise. Does anyone else know how to help blubb?
2011-03-24T21:35:00.000Z	blubb	econdudeawesome	there seems to be something wrong with my hd or file system.
2011-03-24T21:35:00.000Z	blubb		<econdudeawesome> i would guess hd, since dd gives me errors when i try to copy data to an image
2011-03-24T21:40:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	blubb	I'm not sure. Are you able to access the files at all? It sounds like you have a major hard drive crash if that is the case
