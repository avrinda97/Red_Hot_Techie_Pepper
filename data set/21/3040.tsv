2009-09-26T17:03:00.000Z	jrib	nassrat	just ask your question
2009-09-26T17:06:00.000Z	nassrat	jrib	any idea about my question
2009-09-26T17:06:00.000Z	jrib	nassrat	no
2009-09-26T17:07:00.000Z	jrib	nassrat	I'm not really sure what you are doing.  After "ubuntu on fat32" I either assume you are not describing it well or you are doing something not suggested
2009-09-26T17:23:00.000Z	jrib	nassrat	have you checked the documentation?
2009-09-26T17:24:00.000Z	jrib	nassrat	vmlinuz is the linux kernel
2009-09-26T17:24:00.000Z	nassrat	jrib	what about the wierd options that are passed to it, like only-ubiquity
2009-09-26T17:25:00.000Z	jrib	nassrat	you won't know until you check...
2009-09-26T17:25:00.000Z	nassrat	jrib	ubiquity is the ubuntu installer, am i right?
2009-09-26T17:25:00.000Z	jrib	nassrat	yes
2009-09-26T17:26:00.000Z	jrib	nassrat	if you want ubiquity documentation, then go to ubiquity's site...
2009-09-26T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	nassrat	it's apparent no one knows.  So I've suggested you check the documentation for all the relevant software.  Why don't you?
2009-09-26T17:32:00.000Z	jrib	nassrat	I imagine you want to read documentation about casper then as well
2009-09-26T17:33:00.000Z	nassrat	jrib	wheres that?
2009-09-26T17:33:00.000Z	jrib	nassrat	I don't know.
2009-09-26T17:38:00.000Z	jrib	nassrat	"man casper" to get you started
2009-09-26T17:38:00.000Z	nassrat	jrib	does that work for you?
2009-09-26T17:38:00.000Z	jrib	nassrat	http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jaunty/en/man7/casper.7.html
2009-09-26T17:39:00.000Z	nassrat	jrib	thanks, thats what i was looking for
