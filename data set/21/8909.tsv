2005-12-18T09:32:00.000Z	siriusnova		like say I want to use my mouse to jump to 5 seconds
2005-12-18T09:33:00.000Z	siriusnova		after the song starts
2005-12-18T09:35:00.000Z	siriusnova		audacity is really cool

2005-12-18T09:36:00.000Z	siriusnova		:P
2005-12-18T09:36:00.000Z	siriusnova		too many apps, we need a coolubuntuapps.com or something
2005-12-18T09:36:00.000Z	siriusnova		Trying to find a cool app in synaptic is painful
2005-12-18T09:37:00.000Z	AtlantisX	siriusnova	Just make one... ;p
2005-12-18T09:37:00.000Z	AtlantisX	siriusnova	If you do, it will certainly be integrated in the community...
2005-12-18T09:42:00.000Z	AtlantisX	siriusnova	I think under linux it would be appropriate to have those "you might also like" links... KDE, you might also like GNOME, iceWM etc... Get what I mean?
2005-12-18T09:49:00.000Z	AtlantisX	siriusnova	I use kubuntu with iceWM, works well even on lowmem PCs.
2005-12-18T09:50:00.000Z	AtlantisX	siriusnova	Both gnome and kde take about 30 seconds to start up and swap all the time on my pc... While iceWM doesn't even have perceivable loading time and is hell fast.
2005-12-18T09:52:00.000Z	siriusnova	AtlantisX	- well yeah icewm is pretty fast but i like Gnome :D
2005-12-18T09:52:00.000Z	AtlantisX	siriusnova	Just you wait, rich boy... xD
2005-12-18T09:55:00.000Z	siriusnova	AtlantisX	- im actually a FreeBSD guy so I know my unix, but Ubuntu i really really nice, setting it up was simple and everything is well thought out, GUI tools are sane and well planned.
2005-12-18T09:56:00.000Z	AtlantisX	siriusnova	Yeh, thought the same. I was redhat fan before, but now I <3 Ubuntu xD
2005-12-18T09:56:00.000Z	AtlantisX	siriusnova	The MacosX feel comes from gnomes taskbar... xDD
2005-12-18T09:57:00.000Z	siriusnova	AtlantisX	- true, Gnome is turning into Mac OS X lite lol
