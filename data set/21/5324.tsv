2008-02-17T03:29:00.000Z	doofy`		when i do sudo fdisk -l shouldnt all disks attached to the system be listed?
2008-02-17T03:30:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	doofy`	No.. fdisk -l will list all PARTITIONS on the specified device.  eg. fdisk -l /dev/sda
2008-02-17T03:31:00.000Z	doofy`	FourX4Luvn	i had a disk /dev/hda partition was /dev/hda1... its not mounting anymore. How do i list all drives and then remount it
2008-02-17T03:31:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	doofy`	Does /dev/hda1 still appear in  your /etc/fstab?
2008-02-17T03:32:00.000Z	doofy`	FourX4Luvn	yes its there
2008-02-17T03:32:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	doofy`	Then do 'sudo mount -a'
2008-02-17T03:32:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	doofy`	In a terminal, not here ;-)
2008-02-17T03:33:00.000Z	doofy`	FourX4Luvn	of course :)
2008-02-17T03:33:00.000Z	doofy`	FourX4Luvn	i have tried that before... it says its mounting at /media/hda1... when i navigate to that directory theres nothing there
2008-02-17T03:33:00.000Z	doofy`	FourX4Luvn	maybe the drive died :(
2008-02-17T03:34:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	doofy`	what does 'mount' show?
2008-02-17T03:34:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	doofy`	Does it show that partition is mounted?
2008-02-17T03:34:00.000Z	doofy`	FourX4Luvn	no nothing relevant to /dev/hda1
2008-02-17T03:35:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	doofy`	'sudo umount /dev/hda1'  then do 'sudo mount /dev/hda1'
2008-02-17T03:36:00.000Z	doofy`	FourX4Luvn	Failed to access '/dev/hda1': No such file or directory I should mention also that this occured immediatly after hardy heron upgrade. It might be better for me to take this to ubuntu+1
2008-02-17T03:37:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	doofy`	What version where you running before?
2008-02-17T03:37:00.000Z	doofy`	FourX4Luvn	gutsy
2008-02-17T03:38:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	doofy`	Interesting.. Yeah, if it worked under gutsy it should under Hardy I would think.. but then again it IS alpha :)  I have no experience with Hardy though.. so yes, unless someone else here has any input...   Sorry
2008-02-17T03:39:00.000Z	doofy`	FourX4Luvn	no worries, thanks a lot for your help. Ill migrate back to gutsy if i need to. Figured id just try to help
2008-02-17T03:39:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	doofy`	Glad to help.. Just hope you haven't lost any critical data
2008-02-17T03:39:00.000Z	doofy`	FourX4Luvn	everything critical is backed up :) lucky.
