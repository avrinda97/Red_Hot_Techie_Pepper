2007-03-30T12:01:00.000Z	kashogi		i just use my local ip to test it
2007-03-30T12:02:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	sorry, meant to say what ssh server you have on your windows machine?
2007-03-30T12:04:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	you said you are trying to connect "to" your windows? or do you mean from your windows to your linux machine?
2007-03-30T12:12:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	you get an error?
2007-03-30T12:16:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	can you ping your linux box from windows?
2007-03-30T12:22:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	another question are you trying to scp to transfer files, or ssh to use linux command prompt?
2007-03-30T12:23:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	winscp is for scp to transfer files, try downloading putty for windows instead
2007-03-30T12:28:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	what did you put for ip address?
2007-03-30T12:33:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	on windows go to Start->Run, then type:   cmd /k ipconfig  - what address shows up as your ip?
2007-03-30T12:35:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	check to see if your software firewall is not enabled, then try pinging your windows again from your linux box
2007-03-30T12:36:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	what version of windows you using?
2007-03-30T12:36:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	your windows xp firewall or if you have another one such as norton or mcafee etc.
2007-03-30T12:39:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	what firewalls did you disable?
2007-03-30T12:40:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	that's the only firewall you had?
2007-03-30T12:45:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	both are disabled now and you still can't ping .100?
2007-03-30T12:46:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	then I don't know what else the problem could be
2007-03-30T12:50:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	kashogi	can you access your router web server and is there a ping option in there?
