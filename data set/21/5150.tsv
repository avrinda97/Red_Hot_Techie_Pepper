2009-07-13T15:43:00.000Z	micah		my firefox browser keeps randomly shutting can anyone tell me how to fix that?
2009-07-13T15:44:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	have you tried a fresh session?
2009-07-13T15:44:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	when firefox crashes, and starts again, it tries to restore what you were doing at the time of crash, i.e, your session.
2009-07-13T15:45:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	instead of telling it to restore tabs, you can tell it start new... hm. How randomly?
2009-07-13T15:46:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	did you install any new plugins? is it just firefox that crashes?
2009-07-13T15:47:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	tell me more about which apps crash, maybe when they tend to crash?
2009-07-13T15:48:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	well, shucks. It sounds like your video driver, or a really, really bad setting somewhere, but prolly the former
2009-07-13T15:49:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	do glxinfo | grep render   -- tell me if that says yes. Then do lspci, find out which one is your card, and google that line, minus the system specific bus id (0:0 kind of numbers)
2009-07-13T15:49:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	hold on!
2009-07-13T15:50:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	the easy, ubuntu way to try out the proprietary drivers, is to go into your menu, and find the option for hardware drivers.
2009-07-13T15:52:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	then you click to accept the funny, non-gpl licenses behind the drivers ubuntu thinks you need, and it's done. If that doesn't work, then do the google the lspci identifier of your card, (open a console, type lspci, google the non system specific bits)
2009-07-13T15:53:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	yes, good! the 0:1:00.0 part wont be googlable, but the last half is perfect
2009-07-13T16:07:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	take a look at this http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:inSBMEl79ugJ:hardware4linux.info/component/22493/+prosavage8+km266&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a
2009-07-13T16:08:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	keep in mind ubuntu is based on debian, when looking at that totally outdated hardware chart...
2009-07-13T16:08:00.000Z	micah	qe2eqe	whats debian?
2009-07-13T16:09:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	Ubuntu is a fork of Debian... they're both full featured linux distributions. You could say 2009 is to ubuntu as 2002 is to debian, but that's a broad analogy....
2009-07-13T16:11:00.000Z	micah	qe2eqe	so with this website what im i looking for on it and what do i click on?
2009-07-13T16:12:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	you're looking for who reports what about the video cards compatibility. One way to find a working configuration, is to find someone else who found a working configuration for the same stuff...
2009-07-13T16:13:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	anyway, you'll see that the PClinuxOS 2007 i586 did a good job with the card, out of the box
2009-07-13T16:14:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	I say, go ahead and give fixing it the old college try if you want to. But if it seems like it'd be easier, especially if you're the new user you say you are, to migrate to a distro that is known to work for you
2009-07-13T16:16:00.000Z	qe2eqe	micah	=) If you don't have vital data on that computer, i recommend switching from Ubuntu to PClinuxOS, just to see if it works. It should be pretty easy
