2006-10-30T16:12:00.000Z	livingdaylight		help!
2006-10-30T16:12:00.000Z	jme	livingdaylight	what's your question?
2006-10-30T16:12:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jme	my /grub/menu.lst
2006-10-30T16:13:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jme	its a mess. I was trying to install on my other hardrive and i get ped_disc_duplicate error and i don't know what it means
2006-10-30T16:13:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jme	on my /grub/menu.lst i see that edgy is twice on there. What is generic?
2006-10-30T16:14:00.000Z	jme	livingdaylight	I've got Edgy on there twice too, once for recovery mode
2006-10-30T16:15:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jme	no, two entries please look: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29344/
2006-10-30T16:15:00.000Z	jme	livingdaylight	that's normal
2006-10-30T16:15:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jme	two edgy kernel entries
2006-10-30T16:16:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jme	did you look? what is generic opposed to edgy entry without generic?
2006-10-30T16:16:00.000Z	jme	livingdaylight	generic = kernel for all 386 processors
2006-10-30T16:17:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jme	did you look at my list? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29344/
2006-10-30T16:17:00.000Z	jme	livingdaylight	yeah, I looked
2006-10-30T16:17:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jme	and its normal? shux...
2006-10-30T16:18:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jme	all i know is since i've installed edgy on sda1 i've got problems installing anything on sdb5. Ped_disc_duplicated errors come up at partitionphase of installation
2006-10-30T16:20:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jme	gkdesu grub/menu.lst ?
2006-10-30T16:37:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jme	could you look again,please? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29346/  i've only pasted the sda entry. I see 4 entries. 2 for generic and 2 for 386 and one memtest
2006-10-30T16:38:00.000Z	jme	livingdaylight	tbqh, that looks perfectly normal, though my experience with troubleshooting grub is practically nil
2006-10-30T16:40:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jme	when booting up one doesn't want to be overwhelmed by options. One entry per os is enough...for Edgy alone i appear to have 4!
2006-10-30T16:41:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jme	i'm talking about Edgy along right now. 4 entries for one kernel
