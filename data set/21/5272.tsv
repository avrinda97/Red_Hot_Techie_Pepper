2008-05-28T14:40:00.000Z	amikrop		Are there any Ubuntu packages (or, even, linux programs in general) about virtual reality environments?
2008-05-28T14:41:00.000Z	Flannel	amikrop	Definately.  What sort of VR are you looking for?
2008-05-28T14:41:00.000Z	amikrop	Flannel	Let's say, something like Quicktime VR.
2008-05-28T14:43:00.000Z	Flannel	amikrop	I'm not sure about that.  That would depend on whether apple decided to write it for linux.  Or at least, I'm assuming Quicktime VB is a quicktime thing, as opposed to just a protocol/whatever thing
2008-05-28T14:43:00.000Z	amikrop	Flannel	No, I mean a program similar to QuickTime VR.
2008-05-28T14:47:00.000Z	Flannel	amikrop	There's VRML stuff (vrweb is one), also, openscenegraph looks promising,
2008-05-28T14:48:00.000Z	amikrop	Flannel	I see. Thanks.
2008-06-20T15:57:00.000Z	Flannel	amikrop	It'll be in hardy-backports
2008-06-20T15:57:00.000Z	Flannel	amikrop	but not everything is put into backports
2008-06-20T15:57:00.000Z	amikrop	Flannel	Just backports? Not the "main" repos?
2008-06-20T15:57:00.000Z	Flannel	amikrop	correct
2008-06-20T15:58:00.000Z	amikrop	Flannel	Why?
2008-06-20T15:58:00.000Z	Flannel	amikrop	Because versions of things are frozen per release.  Only bugfixes/security updates get put into Ubuntu afterwards
2008-06-20T15:59:00.000Z	amikrop	Flannel	But not new features?
2008-06-20T15:59:00.000Z	Flannel	amikrop	correct.  They'll get put into the next release (and on some packages, put into -backports)
2008-06-20T15:59:00.000Z	Flannel	amikrop	in fact, the guy responsible just asked for a backports sync for wine 1 a few hours ago
2008-06-20T16:00:00.000Z	amikrop	Flannel	;)
2008-06-20T16:01:00.000Z	Flannel	amikrop	But, on another note, the wine people do a good job of maintaining their own Ubuntu repository.  That's definately a viable route
2008-06-20T16:25:00.000Z	amikrop	Flannel	sure
2008-11-12T08:16:00.000Z	Flannel	amikrop	April
2008-11-12T08:16:00.000Z	amikrop	Flannel	ok, thx
