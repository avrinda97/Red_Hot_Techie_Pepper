2009-10-14T00:39:00.000Z	hikenboot		hello i have an intel video adapter in a emachine intel  82945G.GZ I would like to get the 32 bit opengl components installed and working...the people at winehq tells me this is the problem with running a game...anyone know how to go about it?
2009-10-14T00:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	Intel graphics card in 9.04?
2009-10-14T00:42:00.000Z	hikenboot	sebsebseb	yes 9.04 jaunty...sorry didnt address you ;-)
2009-10-14T00:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	uh?
2009-10-14T00:53:00.000Z	hikenboot	sebsebseb	yes I am using 9.04 jaunty on this machine and its an intel 82945G/GZ video card how do i get the opengl 32 bit components working so the Last Choas will work on wine?
2009-10-14T00:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	I don't know about that, but I do know that Intel graphics cards  can get right problems with 9.04, does yours work  properly otherwise?
2009-10-14T00:57:00.000Z	hikenboot	sebsebseb	yes it seems to work fine for them except that it wont run the wine games (which they need in order to make the switch from windows)
2009-10-14T00:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	there are also commercial verisons of Wine that yes are meant to be paid for,  that sometimes games work better in
2009-10-14T01:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	Which game is it?
2009-10-14T01:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	2D or 3D?
2009-10-14T01:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	hmm
2009-10-14T01:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	I haven't tried it personally for 3D gaming, but  Virtualbox 3.0+  have  support for Direct3D 8 or whatever, so maybe it will work in that
2009-10-14T01:01:00.000Z	hikenboot	sebsebseb	they tell me in winehq its an opengl problem
2009-10-14T01:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	of course they need enough RAM to  run a Windows virtual machine
2009-10-14T01:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	There are also some pretty good native games for Linux, people just need to know about them
2009-10-14T01:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	Dual booting for only one game,  isn't that bad really,  as long as Windows is secure enough as well of course, if Internet connected
2009-10-14T01:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	try Virtualbox I suppouse
2009-10-14T01:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	or ask in #vbox if that game will  maybe work in there
2009-11-08T23:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	I am not sure if there is anything for Ubuntu, but Mandriva another Linux distro has in built parantel controls
2009-11-08T23:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	A file can be edited though so  not all websites can be accessed, but I don't know how to do that
2009-11-08T23:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hikenboot	yep that file
