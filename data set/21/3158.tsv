2009-05-07T00:25:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	where does aclocal.m4 come from
2009-05-07T00:26:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	it says something about commands which used to work on previous versions of libtool but not on new ones
2009-05-07T00:27:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	you should mention this on the gambas mailinglist
2009-05-07T00:28:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	without a doubt, however, that doesn't solve your problem
2009-05-07T00:28:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	can you pastebin the contents of the aclocal.m4 file?

2009-05-07T00:31:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	anyway, post this to their mailinglist they mismanaged not supporting a new version of libtool so they should clean up their mess too.
2009-05-07T00:31:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	in the meantime, you can use the gambas packages.
2009-05-07T00:31:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	http://gambas.sourceforge.net/ < see bottom of downloads page there.
2009-05-07T00:33:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	their site features another page which should have newer packages.
2009-05-07T00:34:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	compiling can be hell
2009-05-07T00:34:00.000Z	M0E_lnx	ikanobori	shouldn't be... I've built gambas so many times it's not even funny
2009-05-07T00:35:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	as far as I can find it gambas2 uses libtool 1.5 and ubuntu has libtool 2
2009-05-07T00:36:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	found it
2009-05-07T00:36:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	sudo dpkg --force-downgrade -i libtool1.5.26-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb
2009-05-07T00:37:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	also, maybe you need i386
2009-05-07T00:37:00.000Z	M0E_lnx	ikanobori	is the older one in the repos?
2009-05-07T00:37:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	try it and you'll find out
2009-05-07T00:40:00.000Z	M0E_lnx	ikanobori	running configure again after downgrade... will let ya know
2009-05-07T00:41:00.000Z	ikanobori	M0E_lnx	please do :)
2009-05-07T01:16:00.000Z	M0E_lnx	ikanobori	same results...
