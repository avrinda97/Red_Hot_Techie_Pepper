2011-09-01T23:43:00.000Z	[DeVil-BoY]		i have a laptop dell inspiron 6000 trying to install drivers for the 915GM adapter
2011-09-01T23:43:00.000Z	[DeVil-BoY]		can someone tell me which ones i need to download from that site
2011-09-01T23:45:00.000Z	[DeVil-BoY]		that's for wifi
2011-09-01T23:45:00.000Z	[DeVil-BoY]		i'm trying to improve video performance
2011-09-01T23:45:00.000Z	[DeVil-BoY]		video controller intel 915GM graphics
2011-09-01T23:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[DeVil-BoY]	you may need an xorg.conf file if your disaply device is not reporting EDID
2011-09-01T23:46:00.000Z	[DeVil-BoY]	ActionParsnip	how would i check that?
2011-09-01T23:46:00.000Z	[DeVil-BoY]		EDID
2011-09-01T23:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[DeVil-BoY]	check in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2011-09-01T23:48:00.000Z	[DeVil-BoY]		ok i'm oign to check
2011-09-01T23:50:00.000Z	[DeVil-BoY]	ActionParsnip	it's huge that file
2011-09-01T23:53:00.000Z	[DeVil-BoY]		it has a few entries for the EDID
2011-09-01T23:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[DeVil-BoY]	hardly, its only about 40 lins or so
2011-09-01T23:59:00.000Z	[DeVil-BoY]	ActionParsnip	so does that mean everything is working as it should
2011-09-01T23:59:00.000Z	[DeVil-BoY]		because really, the issue is video playback
2011-09-01T23:59:00.000Z	[DeVil-BoY]		on reboot it play video files after they are playing it goes dark with only sound
2011-09-02T00:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[DeVil-BoY]	if your performance is poor, you may need an xorg.conf to set better settings, or you can add the xorg edgers updates ppa to get a newer driver (not really advised but may help)
2011-09-02T00:04:00.000Z	[DeVil-BoY]		bummer
2011-09-02T00:04:00.000Z	[DeVil-BoY]		might go ms on this laptop
2011-09-02T00:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[DeVil-BoY]	intel is pretty hit and miss. The intel 8xxx is particularly frustrating
