2009-12-17T21:28:00.000Z	Rich864		somebody told me to use live CD to do it, so i booted from cd, and then he just dissapeared
2009-12-17T21:28:00.000Z	LinuxCommunity		 Rich864: you want to install ubuntu right, then go head and select to install it

2009-12-17T21:29:00.000Z	Rich864		i'm trying to partition a harddrive so i can install windows 7
2009-12-17T21:29:00.000Z	LinuxCommunity	Rich864	oh boy... generally it's recommended you install windows first then ubuntu
2009-12-17T21:29:00.000Z	Rich864		i had windows installed
2009-12-17T21:30:00.000Z	Rich864		but made a few mistakes when installing ubuntu, and completely wiped windows vista off the system
2009-12-17T21:30:00.000Z	LinuxCommunity	Rich864	that sucks
2009-12-17T21:30:00.000Z	LinuxCommunity	Rich864	well you can install something like Gparted on ubuntu then create a new partition
2009-12-17T21:31:00.000Z	Rich864	JonathanEllis	Yes please, i tried to install windows 7, and it told me than it couldnt be installed on a partition that wasnt formatted to NTFS
2009-12-17T21:31:00.000Z	Rich864		i did installed Gparted, but it wouldnt let me create a new partition
2009-12-17T21:31:00.000Z	Rich864		install*
2009-12-17T21:31:00.000Z	LinuxCommunity	Rich864	it should let you
2009-12-17T21:31:00.000Z	Rich864		i selected my harddrive, then right clicked the white bar that represents my harddrive, and the "new" option wasnt highlighted
2009-12-17T21:32:00.000Z	Rich864		okay, so which one of you fine gentlemen will tell me which option is easiest :)
