2009-12-29T11:45:00.000Z	neezer		I got an odd error when trying to install skype with sudo apt-get install skype. it says package skype is not available but is referred to by another backage.
2009-12-29T11:45:00.000Z	neezer		*package
2009-12-29T11:46:00.000Z	neezer		I just did sudo apt-get purge skype, and I removed the .Skype folder. Then I restarted and tried to reinstall it.
2009-12-29T11:47:00.000Z	neezer		any ideas on installing skype?
2009-12-29T11:48:00.000Z	neezer		I didn't...how do I do that LordXenu
2009-12-29T11:49:00.000Z	neezer		in synaptic my skype-common is green meaning that it is installed right?
2009-12-29T11:49:00.000Z	neezer		how can that be if I just did a purge?
2009-12-29T11:51:00.000Z	neezer		so how do I "just grab the .deb" from skype....I'm not that good yet..
2009-12-29T11:51:00.000Z	neezer		I'd love to learn though.
2009-12-29T11:51:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	neezer	.deb is like .exe in Winblows World.
2009-12-29T11:52:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	neezer	Yup. Grab the file. Double-click on it. Watch it installing right before your eyes and away you go.
2009-12-29T11:55:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	neezer	I remember a factoid about using older version but I can't find it. It should be okay.
2009-12-29T11:55:00.000Z	neezer	kinja-sheep	thanks for the links!
2010-01-13T10:35:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	neezer	Perhaps cheese or skype.
2010-01-13T10:36:00.000Z	neezer	kinja-sheep	I am having problems with my built in microphone on my HP laptop. I'm looking for an alternative.
2010-01-19T10:37:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	neezer	You might want to run `apt-get -f install' to correct these.
2010-01-19T10:40:00.000Z	neezer	kinja-sheep	i tried the sudo apt-get install, and it looked like it installed without errors. then when I did sudo apt-get update, I got the same error about unmet dependencies. it seems like I'm not getting usbmuxd and libusbmuxd1 to install or somthing.
2010-01-19T10:41:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	neezer	Try installing the packages?
2010-01-19T10:42:00.000Z	neezer	kinja-sheep	I tried with sudo apt-get install libusbmuxd1 usbmuxd. it aparently didn't work.
2010-01-19T10:43:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	neezer	For what app? I don't see libusbmux in the repo.
2010-01-19T10:49:00.000Z	neezer	kinja-sheep	I used a repo for connecting my ipod touch from here: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pmcenery/ppa...Here is the full printout of what I got as a response to sudo apt-get -f install.  http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d6d6c2fc3
