2006-09-04T14:25:00.000Z	Qwell		So, who decided that ubuquity was too good for 640x480 res? ;)
2006-09-04T14:26:00.000Z	Qwell		this really sucks..  I can't get X to start at anything but 640x480@60hz
2006-09-04T14:26:00.000Z	backlit	Qwell	try Driver "vesa" to get going again
2006-09-04T14:27:00.000Z	Qwell	backlit	where?
2006-09-04T14:27:00.000Z	Qwell	backlit	This is the install CD..
2006-09-04T14:27:00.000Z	backlit	Qwell	in xorg.conf, under the Device subsection
2006-09-04T14:27:00.000Z	backlit	Qwell	d'oh that kinda sucks, what video card do you have?
2006-09-04T14:28:00.000Z	Qwell	backlit	should be an i830, I believe
2006-09-04T14:28:00.000Z	backlit	Qwell	just a hunch, try changing the driver to "i810", and then try "sudo /etc/init.d/restart gdm" at the command line and see if that helps
2006-09-04T14:28:00.000Z	Qwell	backlit	it detects the driver as i810
2006-09-04T14:29:00.000Z	backlit	Qwell	may leave you off worse than before, but worst case you will have to reboot
2006-09-04T14:29:00.000Z	Qwell		It's a 82845G/GL
2006-09-04T14:29:00.000Z	backlit	Qwell	then try "vesa" instead and see if restarting gdm helps
2006-09-04T14:30:00.000Z	Qwell	backlit	restarting gdm failed :p
2006-09-04T14:30:00.000Z	Qwell		it "stopped", but X is still running
2006-09-04T14:30:00.000Z	backlit	Qwell	make sure you have commented out any i810-specific options in the device section
2006-09-04T14:31:00.000Z	Qwell		ctrl-alt-backspace did the trick
2006-09-04T14:31:00.000Z	Qwell		So, why do new versions of X hate this card?
2006-09-04T14:31:00.000Z	Qwell		rather, when using i810
2006-09-04T14:31:00.000Z	Qwell		82845G/GL
2006-09-04T14:32:00.000Z	backlit	Qwell	i dunno, but my HTPC uses an i915, so hopefully i'll have some useful tips when i start converting it to Ubuntu
