2011-10-16T14:32:00.000Z	oCean	Gentoo64	fear, uncertainty, doubt. There are many, many succesfull upgrades
2011-10-16T14:32:00.000Z	Gentoo64	oCean	i recommended clean install because almost every message is "i upgraded to 11.10 now i cant log in, or get black screen, or cant boot etc etc
2011-10-16T14:33:00.000Z	oCean	Gentoo64	messages like "because the upgrades break everyones comp" are uncalled for

2011-11-28T00:28:00.000Z	Gentoo64	oCean	i think its just so it mounts it at boot
2011-11-28T00:28:00.000Z	oCean	Gentoo64	no, I really have to create a filter before I can use the device in the guest
