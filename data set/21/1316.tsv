2010-10-26T20:51:00.000Z	eda_		How can I get my floppy drive to read my Floppies? I mount it, click on it and a File manager window opens, but it is blank. Thanx ---ed
2010-10-26T20:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eda_	in a terminal I'd try "df" and see if floppy is listed, and if it's 1.4MB free (meaning nothing on the  floppy disk)
2010-10-26T20:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eda_	they your floppy isn't mounted - it will show up as sdX where X is your next available drive letter
2010-10-26T20:59:00.000Z	eda_	ZykoticK9	The floppy icon shows it's mounted
2010-10-26T20:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eda_	they try looking in ~/.gvfs and see if anything is in there
2010-10-26T21:02:00.000Z	eda_	ZykoticK9	The terminal states: /home/eda/.gvfs: is a directory
2010-10-26T21:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eda_	correct - it's where Gnome mounts its "virtual" stuff
2010-10-26T21:03:00.000Z	eda_	ZykoticK9	Now what?
2010-10-26T21:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eda_	is anything in that directory?
2010-10-26T21:03:00.000Z	eda_	ZykoticK9	How do I find out?
2010-10-26T21:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eda_	look inside that directory with Nautilus (file manager) or use "ls" in a terminal
2010-10-26T21:07:00.000Z	eda_	ZykoticK9	This is what I did & reply:  eda@Lin:~$ ls
2010-10-26T21:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eda_	you need to "cd .gvfs" first
2010-10-26T21:10:00.000Z	eda_	ZykoticK9	I entered eda@Lin:~/.gvfs$ ls  & got this: eda@Lin:~/.gvfs$ ls
2010-10-26T21:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eda_	so it doesn't seem like your floppy is mounted?!  Sorry I'm not sure what's wrong - best of luck.
2010-10-26T21:13:00.000Z	eda_	ZykoticK9	Thank you. I used to know how to do all this when I started with my XT PC with DOS.
2010-10-26T21:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eda_	have you tried "sudo mount /dev/fd0 /mnt"?
2010-10-26T21:20:00.000Z	eda_	ZykoticK9	I tried "sudo mount /dev/fd0 /mnt" the drive light comes on , the icon shows it  mounted & file manager is empty. I tried with several Mfr's floppies & nothing!
2010-10-26T21:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eda_	you would need to be looking in /mnt with the mount command i gave you...
2010-10-26T21:26:00.000Z	eda_	ZykoticK9	Thanks for your help. I need to take a break, I'm very tired.
2010-10-26T21:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eda_	best of luck!
