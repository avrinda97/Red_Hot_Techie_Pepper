2011-11-24T16:04:00.000Z	laoli	phlak_user	can you help me on how can i visit Windows machine in LAN?
2011-11-24T16:06:00.000Z	phlak_user	laoli	sure just click on nautilus (file explorer) and click on Browse Network
2011-11-24T16:07:00.000Z	laoli	phlak_user	it would not help i'm afraid. it just showed a "WORKGROUP" and nothing else; I can not visit any machine in that workgroup
2011-11-24T16:09:00.000Z	phlak_user	laoli	that might be due to your network not being configured/connected
2011-11-24T16:09:00.000Z	phlak_user	laoli	we have no way of knowing even if that windows machine and yours are on the same LAN; can ping each other etc etc
2011-11-24T16:09:00.000Z	laoli	phlak_user	I tried to config samba, and it worked once, but now I can not repeat it anymore
2011-11-24T16:12:00.000Z	laoli	phlak_user	yes, samba, and I think I have config it right, although someone told me that i might messed something up ...
2011-11-24T16:13:00.000Z	phlak_user	laoli	messed what?
2011-11-24T16:13:00.000Z	phlak_user	laoli	can you try with smbclient in a terminal?
2011-11-24T16:13:00.000Z	laoli	phlak_user	one of my friend told me that samba is very difficult to config and he don't think I did it in the right way
2011-11-24T16:14:00.000Z	phlak_user	laoli	as a client, theres not much to configure
2011-11-24T16:15:00.000Z	laoli	phlak_user	I'm sure it worked once, but only once
2011-11-24T16:15:00.000Z	phlak_user	laoli	just type smbclient -L windows-machine-name
2011-11-24T16:16:00.000Z	phlak_user	laoli	replace windows-machine-name with the netbios name of that machine
2011-11-24T16:16:00.000Z	laoli	phlak_user	the problem is, sometimes i just can not remember the full name of the machine, nor the IP address, so i wannna view these machines in the folder...
2011-11-24T16:16:00.000Z	phlak_user	laoli	it should show you the resources on the machine
2011-11-24T16:17:00.000Z	phlak_user	laoli	this will only help you establish if your samba is working fine
2011-11-24T16:17:00.000Z	laoli	phlak_user	however, there is another way I can visit : place -> connect to server. this works
2011-11-24T16:18:00.000Z	phlak_user	laoli	ok
2011-11-24T16:18:00.000Z	laoli	phlak_user	so what could be the problme?
2011-11-24T16:24:00.000Z	laoli	phlak_user	thank you for your help
