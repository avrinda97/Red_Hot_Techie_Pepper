2010-05-16T16:31:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	DrGrov	compiz-fusion
2010-05-16T16:32:00.000Z	DrGrov	TheMusicGuy	is that real eyecandy? :) Serious stuff that really tests my computer to the limit?
2010-05-16T16:32:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	DrGrov	it can be depending on what you do with it.
2010-05-16T16:32:00.000Z	DrGrov	TheMusicGuy	What should I get from the repositories then? Emerald or?
2010-05-16T16:33:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	DrGrov	that's up to you
2010-05-16T16:33:00.000Z	DrGrov	TheMusicGuy	I want to really make my new computer work it hard! lol
2010-05-16T16:33:00.000Z	DrGrov	TheMusicGuy	can you give me some names from the repositories if I want the most out of it? PM please a few names.
2010-05-16T16:34:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	DrGrov	I don't know the exact names. Just search for compiz and read the descriptions.
2010-05-16T16:35:00.000Z	DrGrov	TheMusicGuy	ok. Will do that. Thanks :)
2010-05-16T16:39:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	DrGrov	emerald is just a window decorator. That's really not even the tip of the iceberg for what compiz can do.
2010-05-16T16:40:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	DrGrov	If you want to see what compiz can REALLY do, get the configuration manager and the fusion-icon.
2010-05-16T16:41:00.000Z	DrGrov	TheMusicGuy	yes I have them now.
2010-05-16T16:42:00.000Z	DrGrov	TheMusicGuy	the only problem is i can't get anything running in Compiz
2010-05-16T16:42:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	DrGrov	what do you mean?
2010-05-16T16:56:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	DrGrov	Ubuntu has a configuration utility for running commands when a user logs in.
2010-05-16T16:57:00.000Z	DrGrov	TheMusicGuy	ok. I will try that. I hope it is easy to keep it running. One thing I really want to have from compiz is transparency.
2010-05-16T16:58:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	DrGrov	it can definitely do that.
2010-05-16T16:59:00.000Z	DrGrov	TheMusicGuy	good. I just don't find that setting somewhere in Compiz with the fusion-icon.... :(
2010-05-16T17:11:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	DrGrov	what do mean by "change desktop"?
2010-05-16T17:14:00.000Z	DrGrov	TheMusicGuy	I mean to change my desktop like scrolling through the 4 virtual desktops that is there by default.
