2011-06-30T01:52:00.000Z	LjL	duckx0r	can you provide a screenshot with chromium visible but no icon for it in the panel? then you can append it to a bug report
2011-06-30T01:52:00.000Z	duckx0r	LjL	It's a fresh install. Chromium is there, but clicking on it opens up a new window
2011-06-30T01:50:00.000Z	LjL	duckx0r	the panel on the left. open windows have a tick near them
2011-06-30T01:52:00.000Z	duckx0r	LjL	it doesn't work for all windows. For example chromium.
2011-06-30T01:52:00.000Z	LjL	duckx0r	that sounds like a bug, it should work
2011-06-30T01:53:00.000Z	LjL	duckx0r	oh it opens a new window, hmm. that's weird as what people usually complain about is the opposite, i.e. that they can't open new windows. i'm not using Unity at the moment, but maybe try right-clicking and see if there is an option to show
2011-06-30T01:54:00.000Z	LjL	duckx0r	i can't receive DCC, please upload it to imageshack.us or your favorite image host
2011-06-30T01:54:00.000Z	duckx0r	LjL	ok

2011-06-30T01:56:00.000Z	LjL	duckx0r	well it doesn't show up as open. but it should. let me see if i can find an existing bug report about it, otherwise you should file one
2011-06-30T01:58:00.000Z	duckx0r	LjL	I clicked on the ubuntu logo, searched for chrome, then dragged it to the "panel" or whatever that thing is called now and clicked on it to open it.
2011-06-30T01:58:00.000Z	LjL	duckx0r	that sounds correct
2011-06-30T01:58:00.000Z	LjL	duckx0r	maybe you could just try removing it and doing it again, though
2011-06-30T01:58:00.000Z	duckx0r	LjL	good idea
2011-06-30T01:59:00.000Z	duckx0r	LjL	lol, removed it. chromium is open and no icon is in the launcher
2011-06-30T01:59:00.000Z	duckx0r	LjL	i closed chromium and reopened it too
2011-06-30T01:59:00.000Z	LjL	duckx0r	close chromium, add the icon again, then launch chromium and see
2011-06-30T02:00:00.000Z	LjL	duckx0r	i didn't seem to find an existing report on this by the way
2011-06-30T02:00:00.000Z	duckx0r	LjL	ActionParsnip let me try relogging
2011-06-30T02:00:00.000Z	LjL	duckx0r	ok
2011-06-30T02:04:00.000Z	duckx0r	LjL	ActionParsnip it's working now. Must have been a computer fart.
