2006-07-26T08:48:00.000Z	farous	kruncher	did you man mount
2006-07-26T08:48:00.000Z	farous	kruncher	you should put in the options ro,user
2006-07-26T08:49:00.000Z	farous	kruncher	as described in the man
2006-07-26T08:49:00.000Z	farous	kruncher	i guess it should be rw,user
2006-07-26T08:53:00.000Z	farous	kruncher	/dev/hda?       /mountpoint               ext3    rw, suid, dev, exec, auto,user,async 0  2
2006-07-26T08:57:00.000Z	kruncher	farous	that line for /etc/fstab worked, thank you alot, now i have to figure out what that all means
2006-07-26T08:59:00.000Z	farous	kruncher	glad it worked :)
2006-07-26T09:00:00.000Z	farous	kruncher	better go with JW way
2006-07-26T09:00:00.000Z	kruncher	farous	JW?
2006-07-26T09:00:00.000Z	farous	kruncher	chown on the mounted partition
2006-07-26T09:01:00.000Z	kruncher	farous	whys that?
2006-07-26T09:01:00.000Z	farous	kruncher	i will leave JW to explain that to you. but i assume it is more reliable
2006-07-26T09:05:00.000Z	farous	kruncher	lets assume your fstab is corrupted or you installed new linux dist. then you loose the permissions you set. doing it on the harddisk using chown will avoid this prob
2006-07-26T10:25:00.000Z	farous	kruncher	difficult :)
2006-07-26T10:25:00.000Z	farous	kruncher	just download the binary package untar it and use it without installation
