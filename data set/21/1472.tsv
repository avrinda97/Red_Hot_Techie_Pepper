2010-09-05T13:57:00.000Z	luw		so have been using chrome for about a month now with pretty much no problems.  all the sudden now it takes longer than normal to resolve websites.  several seconds.  i fear that maybe something has pointed my computer to a proxy for all internet traffic.  is there a way to see this other than wireshark?
2010-09-05T13:57:00.000Z	luw		ubuntu 9.04, and i think this is a os problem, not a chrome problem
