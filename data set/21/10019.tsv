2005-12-04T14:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	rhoffa	right click on the icon, and select "Properties"
2005-12-04T14:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	rhoffa	after you right-click, select the middle tab - Permissions - is the owner the same as your user, or is it root?
2005-12-04T14:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	rhoffa	the files show up on your actual desktop, right?
2005-12-04T14:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	rhoffa	if that worked, the lock icon should have been removed - is it?
2005-12-04T14:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	rhoffa	then you should be OK, and you'll be OK in the future
2005-12-04T14:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	rhoffa	EasyTag
2005-12-04T14:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	rhoffa	open Synaptic and install EasyTag, it's fairly straightforward and powerful
2005-12-04T14:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	rhoffa	I just ignore that little popup window, to be honest
2005-12-06T09:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	rhoffa	gnome-art? yes.
2005-12-13T10:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	rhoffa	isn't bittornado in the repos?
2005-12-13T10:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	rhoffa	i've resumed torrents with the Gnome Torrent client before
