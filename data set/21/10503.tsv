2005-02-15T11:02:00.000Z	Anubis		I'm really starting to like this!
2005-02-15T11:02:00.000Z	Anubis		After only an hour
2005-02-15T11:03:00.000Z	ewhitten	Anubis	 first time on linux, or just ubuntu?
2005-02-15T11:04:00.000Z	Anubis	ewhitten	just Ubuntu
2005-02-15T11:04:00.000Z	ewhitten	Anubis	 same here.  I switched a couple weeks ago, moved up to hoary the other day.  it absolutely rocks.
2005-02-15T11:05:00.000Z	Anubis	ewhitten	REALLY, I did not think Hoary was ready or availible yet
2005-02-15T11:05:00.000Z	ewhitten	Anubis	 it's still in beta.  if you want hoary, just change all the warty references in /etc/apt/sources.list to hoary
2005-02-15T11:06:00.000Z	ewhitten	Anubis	 then apt-get update ; apt-get -f dist-upgrade :)
2005-02-15T11:07:00.000Z	Anubis	ewhitten	I'm just adding new reposities now, and looking to get my nvidia drivers installed
2005-02-15T11:07:00.000Z	ewhitten	Anubis	 need help with the nvidia part?  it's really easy.
2005-02-15T11:07:00.000Z	Anubis	ewhitten	Don't know if I need, but would like;)
2005-02-15T11:08:00.000Z	ewhitten	Anubis	 just go to synaptic, find kernel-restricted-modules for your running kernel, and then install all the nvidia-glx packages
2005-02-15T11:09:00.000Z	Anubis	ewhitten	can't be that easy?!?
2005-02-15T11:09:00.000Z	ewhitten	Anubis	 you betcha. :)
2005-02-15T11:10:00.000Z	Anubis	ewhitten	I don't have to edit my XFree conf file?
2005-02-15T11:10:00.000Z	ewhitten	Anubis	if you've already edited it for something else, it might not work.  md5sum wouldn't match what ubuntu thinks it should be.
2005-02-15T11:12:00.000Z	Anubis	ewhitten	no I have not edited XFree for anything yet
2005-02-15T11:13:00.000Z	ewhitten	Anubis	 Then it should all just automagically work.  Just run it, then check your files to be sure.
2005-02-15T11:15:00.000Z	Anubis	ewhitten	o enable the driver, run "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable"
2005-02-15T11:16:00.000Z	ewhitten	Anubis	 you bet.  There's an official guide for nvidia in the wiki as well.
2005-02-17T16:09:00.000Z	ewhitten	Anubis	 sudo /etc/init.d/service  start | stop | restart | etc
