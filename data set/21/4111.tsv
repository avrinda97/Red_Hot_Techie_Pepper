2009-07-29T03:05:00.000Z	ishmandoo		i just installed ubuntu 9.04 and my wireless card is constantly disconnecting, does anyone know why that would be?
2009-07-29T03:05:00.000Z	HardDisk	ishmandoo	type dmesg in terminal and see what the error is.
2009-07-29T03:09:00.000Z	ishmandoo	HardDisk	i'm not sure what i'm looking for
2009-07-29T03:10:00.000Z	HardDisk	ishmandoo	error messages at the end while you connect
2009-07-29T03:13:00.000Z	ishmandoo	HardDisk	are all of the things i'm reading errors?
2009-07-29T03:15:00.000Z	HardDisk	ishmandoo	no, but you should see some error outputs that are obvious
2009-07-29T03:15:00.000Z	HardDisk		like wifi, eth0 not restarting
2009-07-29T03:15:00.000Z	HardDisk		cannot reset mac address
2009-07-29T03:15:00.000Z	HardDisk		etc
2009-07-29T03:15:00.000Z	ishmandoo	HardDisk	i don't see anything like that...any other ideas?
2009-07-29T03:16:00.000Z	HardDisk	ishmandoo	well it comes down to what chipset you have for the wifi
2009-07-29T03:16:00.000Z	HardDisk		and look at the ubuntu wiki page for it
2009-07-29T03:16:00.000Z	ishmandoo	HardDisk	how can i find that out?
2009-07-29T03:17:00.000Z	HardDisk	ishmandoo	one sec
