2006-10-16T13:58:00.000Z	v-stargazer	jacked	Anything else I need to do besides modifying the laptop-mode.conf?
2006-10-16T14:00:00.000Z	jacked	v-stargazer	make sure sleep is enabled.... blah blah
2006-10-16T14:01:00.000Z	v-stargazer	jacked	I would assume that a restart is needed...and it's only 1 am here...
2006-10-16T14:01:00.000Z	jacked	v-stargazer	that's the easiest way, yeah
2006-10-16T14:17:00.000Z	v-stargazer	jacked	no effect. backlight remains lit, though screen is otherwise blank. I need it to turn the backlight off.
2006-10-16T14:18:00.000Z	jacked	v-stargazer	put the contents of the two files I suggested that you modify into pastebin.ca
2006-10-16T14:23:00.000Z	jacked	v-stargazer	I mentioned /etc/default/acpi-support
2006-10-16T14:36:00.000Z	jacked	v-stargazer	which one
2006-10-16T14:36:00.000Z	v-stargazer	jacked	Finally got the acpi-support file open (read only). What line should I be looking for? <--repeaded
2006-10-16T14:37:00.000Z	jacked	v-stargazer	did you get my message to paste the contents of THAT file and laptop[...] .conf file into pastebin.ca?
2006-10-16T14:39:00.000Z	jacked	v-stargazer	and why can you only get it to open read-only?  you'll need to do chmod o+w /etc/defaults/apci-support (or something like that)
2006-10-16T14:44:00.000Z	v-stargazer	jacked	http://pastebin.ca/204808 <--laptop-mode.conf | http://pastebin.ca/204810 <--acpi-support
2006-10-16T14:47:00.000Z	jacked	v-stargazer	your acpi-support file isn't there
2006-10-16T14:47:00.000Z	jacked	v-stargazer	my bad
2006-10-16T14:48:00.000Z	v-stargazer	jacked	it should be there...
2006-10-16T14:51:00.000Z	jacked	v-stargazer	   in laptop file:  ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_ON_AC=1   in ACPI file: uncomment this line:  ACPI_SLEEP=true and ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE=true (if you have problems, then put ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE back to false and try again)
2006-10-16T14:54:00.000Z	v-stargazer	jacked	k, I'll try that.
2006-10-16T15:27:00.000Z	v-stargazer	jacked	no joy, it's still not doing what I want...
2006-10-16T15:27:00.000Z	jacked	v-stargazer	does sleep work at all?
2006-10-16T15:28:00.000Z	jacked	v-stargazer	but doesn't work when the lid is closed, is that the only issue at this point?
2006-10-16T15:29:00.000Z	v-stargazer	jacked	wasn't having a problem with Sleep/Hibernate.
