2005-04-20T10:46:00.000Z	alterim		i'm sure you approve of those
2005-04-20T10:47:00.000Z	alterim		libxvidcore4 is in the cache
2005-04-20T10:47:00.000Z	alterim		but uninstalled
2005-04-20T10:47:00.000Z	alterim		i don't know what made you think i had the wrong repos simply because it was uninstalled
2005-04-20T10:48:00.000Z	alterim		i don't know delire, how do i find out?
2005-04-20T10:48:00.000Z	alterim		what makes you think i use mplayer or xine?
2005-04-20T10:49:00.000Z	alterim		i installed ubuntu 5.04
2005-04-20T10:49:00.000Z	alterim		which comes with neither
2005-04-20T10:49:00.000Z	alterim		so it's more than likely i simply have totem/gstreamer, which is default, no?
2005-04-20T10:49:00.000Z	alterim		no thoreauputic
