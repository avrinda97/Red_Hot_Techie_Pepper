2005-06-06T09:27:00.000Z	dsd		if anyone can help me please pm me
2005-06-06T09:27:00.000Z	dooglus	dsd	just ask here and we'll help if we can
2005-06-06T09:30:00.000Z	dooglus	dsd	it's not a good idea to install binaries compiled for other distros
2005-06-06T09:30:00.000Z	dooglus	dsd	just use the 'system menu', then 'administration', then 'synaptic' to install the program you want
2005-06-06T09:31:00.000Z	dsd	dooglus	thanks alot
2005-06-06T09:32:00.000Z	dooglus	dsd	airsnort is available.  I don't see 'aireplay', but 'aircrack' is there.
2005-06-06T09:32:00.000Z	dsd	dooglus	where do u see the list? on the ubuntu site?
2005-06-06T09:32:00.000Z	dooglus	dsd	no, in 'synaptic'
2005-06-06T09:33:00.000Z	dsd	dooglus	thanks
2005-06-06T09:34:00.000Z	dooglus	dsd	alternatively, go here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/ and type, for example "aireplay" into the 2nd 'keyboard' box.  it'll tell you which package aireplay is in
2005-06-06T09:36:00.000Z	dsd	dooglus	thanks so do u think if i just write down a list of progs that knoppix has which ubuntu doesnt and then search it on the ubuntu packages search engine, I will most likely find what i need?
2005-06-06T09:37:00.000Z	dooglus	dsd	yes.  one thing though, you probably don't have all the sources you need set up yet.  it's easy to do though.
2005-06-06T09:38:00.000Z	dsd	dooglus	youve been a great help but excuse me for my newbiness but what exactly are sources
2005-06-06T09:39:00.000Z	dooglus	dsd	did you run 'synaptic' yet?
2005-06-06T09:40:00.000Z	dsd	dooglus	no but im sure i have it. im going to try getting ubuntu onto a partition for now and ill get back to u when im on it. Im sure im going to run into a lot of trouble since i have a broadcom 4306 chipset as my wifi
2005-06-06T09:43:00.000Z	dsd	dooglus	one more thing, i have tried searching my chipset EVERYWHERE to see if it is compatible with any kind of wep hacking programs but ive found nothing, do u have any suggestions as to where i might obtain a program that is compatilbe with the bcm4306 chipset
2005-06-06T09:44:00.000Z	dooglus	dsd	I don't know much about wireless, sorry.  I only tried for about 10 minutes to get WEP working with my adaptor before I decided that I'd rather use a cable anyway.
2005-06-06T09:45:00.000Z	dsd	dooglus	ok thanks alot ill try out ur suggestions
2005-06-06T15:47:00.000Z	dooglus	dsd	I recommend a program called "boot-it ng" if you want to resize a windows partition.  worked a treat for me.  it's "shareware" though
2005-06-06T15:50:00.000Z	dsd	dooglus	thanks ill try it out and see if it works *Crosses fingers*
