2007-04-27T08:32:00.000Z	thebillywayne	mobutu	in feisty?
2007-04-27T08:33:00.000Z	thebillywayne	mobutu	System>Preferences>Desktop Effects
2007-04-27T08:33:00.000Z	thebillywayne	mobutu	no.  a little different.
2007-04-30T10:52:00.000Z	mobutu	thebillywayne	does    mplayer -vo gl video.mpg    work ?
2007-04-30T10:53:00.000Z	thebillywayne	mobutu	well, it's a DVD.  would that command work for a DVD?
2007-04-30T10:54:00.000Z	thebillywayne	mobutu	i don't have any mpg's to test your command on.  sorry.
2007-04-30T11:00:00.000Z	mobutu	thebillywayne	sure!
2007-04-30T11:01:00.000Z	mobutu	thebillywayne	try vlc , mplayer , gxine , kaffeine
2007-04-30T11:01:00.000Z	thebillywayne	mobutu	RAOF, I think that's what's happened then.
2007-04-30T11:01:00.000Z	thebillywayne	mobutu	I'm trying vlc and mplayer.
2007-04-30T11:04:00.000Z	thebillywayne	mobutu	gxine is also giving me errors.  I guess I'm just sol.
2007-04-30T11:05:00.000Z	mobutu	thebillywayne	there are so many people saying so many things in this channel, that i no longer remember what your problem was
2007-04-30T11:05:00.000Z	thebillywayne	mobutu	DVD playback error after changing video drivers.
2007-04-30T11:10:00.000Z	thebillywayne	mobutu	vlc still crashes when I try to open a DVD.  same error that I paste-bin'ed before.  Thanks for your help though.
2007-04-30T11:11:00.000Z	mobutu	thebillywayne	you should download some wacky mpg from the internet
2007-04-30T11:11:00.000Z	mobutu	thebillywayne	and see if you can play it in vlc/whatever
2007-04-30T11:13:00.000Z	thebillywayne	mobutu	no mpg play ability either.
2007-04-30T11:14:00.000Z	mobutu	thebillywayne	so it's probably not a dvd playing specific problem
2007-04-30T11:14:00.000Z	mobutu	thebillywayne	vlc has a dialogue that lets you select different video drives for output
2007-04-30T11:14:00.000Z	mobutu	thebillywayne	you should experiment with them
