2005-05-31T08:25:00.000Z	IceDC571		hmm... i love ubuntu
2005-05-31T08:25:00.000Z	IceDC571		ohh
2005-05-31T08:26:00.000Z	IceDC571		i dont know.. never tried it, but what are the advantages of kde?
2005-05-31T08:28:00.000Z	IceDC571		is it possible to install windows running with linux if i already have linux installed on one hard drive?
2005-05-31T08:29:00.000Z	crimsun	IceDC571	sure, though you'll want an install or a livecd handy to restore grub/lilo
2005-07-02T12:20:00.000Z	crimsun	IceDC571	/ Xyc0: there is NOTHING wrong with recommending ubuntuguide, but always add the disclaimer that it's unofficial.
2005-07-02T12:30:00.000Z	crimsun	IceDC571	no, everyone else in the world uses emacs.
2005-07-09T05:47:00.000Z	crimsun	IceDC571	it can if you have at least 64 MB of swap
2005-07-09T05:48:00.000Z	crimsun	IceDC571	you'd have to run a really slim wm (or none at all) with very few extensions loaded
2005-07-15T10:59:00.000Z	crimsun	IceDC571	userspace portions, yes
2005-07-16T10:28:00.000Z	crimsun	IceDC571	"no one?"
2005-07-16T10:28:00.000Z	IceDC571	crimsun	ahh, you did
2005-07-16T10:29:00.000Z	crimsun	IceDC571	so did you
2005-09-06T10:56:00.000Z	crimsun	IceDC571	where does it hang?
2005-09-06T10:57:00.000Z	IceDC571	crimsun	where it downloads the files with apt im always stuck at like 81% and its totally un-responsive and locked
2005-09-06T10:57:00.000Z	crimsun	IceDC571	what does the installer log tell you? (alt+fX)
2005-09-06T10:59:00.000Z	crimsun	IceDC571	have you tried installing without an Internet connection?
2005-09-06T11:00:00.000Z	IceDC571	crimsun	it just stays at 0% without an internet connection too
2005-09-06T11:00:00.000Z	crimsun	IceDC571	have you filed a bug about this?
2005-09-06T11:01:00.000Z	IceDC571	crimsun	well i think some people already know about it.. i've downloaded a daily live cd before and it gave me a dialog to bypass the installation since apt-get isnt receiving anything
2005-09-06T11:04:00.000Z	IceDC571	crimsun	have you installed breezy from the colony 3 release?
