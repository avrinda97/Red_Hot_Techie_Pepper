2012-07-18T10:53:00.000Z	D1		hi need help with ubuntu
2012-07-18T10:54:00.000Z	D1		anyone online?
2012-07-18T10:54:00.000Z	D1		Is about booting it up... I downloaded from the original site
2012-07-18T10:54:00.000Z	D1		and it didnt work
2012-07-18T10:54:00.000Z	D1		the instalation "trial" does not load
2012-07-18T10:56:00.000Z	L3top	D1	have you checked the md5sum of the image you are burning?
2012-07-18T10:57:00.000Z	D1	L3top	i do not know what that is, i simply burnt the image with Alcohol 120% on a DVD
2012-07-18T11:00:00.000Z	D1	L3top	cool, checking it now
2012-07-18T11:05:00.000Z	D1	L3top	ok, i got this for the ISO image downloaded from the official website d791352694374f1c478779f7f4447a3f
2012-07-18T11:05:00.000Z	D1	L3top	Is this normal?
2012-07-18T11:07:00.000Z	D1	L3top	yes it is identical
2012-07-18T11:08:00.000Z	L3top	D1	then the image is not the problem. You have some piece of hardware that is tripping it up.
2012-07-18T11:08:00.000Z	D1	L3top	i shall try burning in another new DVD
2012-07-18T11:08:00.000Z	L3top	D1	if you dropped it to USB with the same behavior, I don't think the burn is bad.
2012-07-18T11:09:00.000Z	D1	L3top	nor the USB or the DVD works
2012-07-18T11:10:00.000Z	D1	L3top	I followed the prompt, it says reboot is requred. Then I went for I want to reboot now. It rebooted the Window. I am absolutely certain that I change the boot priority right
2012-07-18T11:10:00.000Z	D1	L3top	So I tried the Help me to boot from CD
2012-07-18T11:12:00.000Z	D1	L3top	strange... i no longer get the error for "Help me boot Helper"
2012-07-18T11:12:00.000Z	D1	L3top	it is installing something right now on my USB with ubuntu on it
2012-07-18T11:12:00.000Z	D1	L3top	that doesnt stuff up my files and OS on other partition right?
2012-07-18T11:15:00.000Z	D1	L3top	ok... i just retried Ubuntu on another PC (not this one which I want it installed), it WORKS
