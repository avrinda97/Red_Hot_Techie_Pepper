2007-08-22T14:59:00.000Z	nickrud	lekremyelsew	you can try sudo dpkg -r --force-reinstreq adobereader-enu
2007-08-22T14:59:00.000Z	nickrud	lekremyelsew	after trying Pricey's
2007-08-22T15:00:00.000Z	nickrud	lekremyelsew	if you can get it installed properly, then you can uninstall it cleanly.
2007-08-22T15:01:00.000Z	lekremyelsew	nickrud	which is what i am trying to do
2007-08-22T15:01:00.000Z	nickrud	lekremyelsew	have you tried the apt-get update && apt-get -f install yet?
2007-08-22T15:02:00.000Z	lekremyelsew	nickrud	i get the same error
2007-08-22T15:02:00.000Z	nickrud	lekremyelsew	then try the sudo dpkg -r --force-reinstreq adobereader-enu
2007-08-22T15:03:00.000Z	lekremyelsew	nickrud	unknown option reinstreq
2007-08-22T15:10:00.000Z	nickrud	lekremyelsew	didn't abandon you, the boss called.
2007-08-22T15:10:00.000Z	nickrud	lekremyelsew	how'd it go?
2007-08-22T15:10:00.000Z	nickrud	lekremyelsew	I just scrolled back. a sec.
2007-08-22T15:10:00.000Z	lekremyelsew	nickrud	still doesnt work, is there a way to manually uninstall it
2007-08-22T15:11:00.000Z	nickrud	lekremyelsew	sorry, I got the option wrong (shouldn't depend on memory for little used options): try again, with  sudo dpkg -r --force-remove-reinstreq adobereader-enu
2007-08-22T15:12:00.000Z	nickrud	lekremyelsew	be back in a couple minutes

2008-04-23T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	lekremyelsew	a shorthand for 'I have no idea, since I don't know what you're trying to do' ;)
