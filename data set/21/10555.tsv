2005-02-05T16:11:00.000Z	paranora	Quarupt	edit the file to choose 30-50 for horizontal and 50-100 for the vert. you will get 1024x768 with that.
2005-02-05T16:11:00.000Z	paranora	Quarupt	take out a piece of paper now.
2005-02-05T16:11:00.000Z	paranora	Quarupt	and write it down :)
2005-02-05T16:12:00.000Z	paranora	Quarupt	respawn is stupid that way.
2005-02-05T16:15:00.000Z	paranora	Quarupt	dpkg --reconfigure will do that. it will ask you questions.
2005-02-05T16:16:00.000Z	paranora	Quarupt	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-02-05T16:17:00.000Z	paranora	Quarupt	or  dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86 depends which you chose to install.
2005-02-05T16:17:00.000Z	paranora	Quarupt	in any case, you'll have to edit /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
2005-02-05T16:19:00.000Z	paranora	Quarupt	seeya soon here
2005-02-05T16:21:00.000Z	paranora	Quarupt	there's nothing to get confused about. you reconfigure the xserver-xfree86, then you restart the login manager, called gdm so you say /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2005-02-05T16:24:00.000Z	paranora	Quarupt	seeya soon. and get back here.
