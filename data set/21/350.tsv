2012-03-26T19:52:00.000Z	PatrickC		that'll take a while, but it'll find any folder/files with .vim in it ;)

2012-03-26T19:54:00.000Z	PatrickC		which is better to make? live CD or live USB?
2012-03-26T19:55:00.000Z	PatrickC		recover my dead laptop
2012-03-26T19:55:00.000Z	PatrickC		it has corrupt/missing system files for windows
2012-03-26T19:56:00.000Z	PatrickC		well, I will need to download files
2012-03-26T19:57:00.000Z	PatrickC		I think I have a spare 4gb USB drive around here somewhere...
2012-03-26T19:57:00.000Z	PatrickC		speed I assume?
2012-03-26T19:57:00.000Z	PatrickC		my HDD sounds like its sending out Morse code, so I just want to get some files off of it and maybe get it booting again
2012-03-26T19:58:00.000Z	Yaaaaaa	PatrickC	it is clicking alot ?
2012-03-26T19:58:00.000Z	PatrickC		not tons, but it is clicking
2012-03-26T19:59:00.000Z	PatrickC		and its off and on when it'll click between a little and a lot
2012-03-26T19:59:00.000Z	Yaaaaaa		probably going bad then.
2012-03-26T19:59:00.000Z	PatrickC		which worries me
2012-03-26T19:59:00.000Z	PatrickC		I have very sensitive files on this HDD, haven't had time to back them up.. which is why I want to boot Linux :)
2012-03-26T20:00:00.000Z	Yaaaaaa	PatrickC	I would get a live setup going immediatly then (USB if possible) and get the files off before that HD kicks the bucket for good.
2012-03-26T20:01:00.000Z	PatrickC	Yaaaaaa	yeah.. tats what I wanna try and do
2012-03-26T20:01:00.000Z	PatrickC		that's*
2012-03-26T20:01:00.000Z	Yaaaaaa	PatrickC	all you need is the .iso and usbcreator app or something such.
2012-03-26T20:01:00.000Z	PatrickC	Yaaaaaa	and a working computer ;)
