2011-05-17T23:00:00.000Z	archman		anyone knows how to install the vbox guest additions when running ubuntu live cd with virtualbox (since I have only one slot for images)?
2011-05-17T23:00:00.000Z	archman		wanna test unity on vbox
2011-05-17T23:01:00.000Z	satz	archman	unity didn't work on my vbox
2011-05-17T23:01:00.000Z	archman	satz	aaah crap :/, ok then
2011-05-17T23:02:00.000Z	archman	satz	but you did install the additions?
2011-05-17T23:02:00.000Z	satz	archman	though i allocated 2 cores and 900 mb ram
2011-05-17T23:02:00.000Z	satz	archman	no.
2011-05-17T23:02:00.000Z	archman	satz	well, that's why you didn't have it
2011-05-17T23:03:00.000Z	satz	archman	give it a try
2011-05-17T23:03:00.000Z	archman	satz	will do
2011-05-17T23:03:00.000Z	satz	archman	how much resources are you allocating
2011-05-17T23:04:00.000Z	archman	satz	1GB RAM
2011-05-17T23:04:00.000Z	satz	archman	good. first 'try ubuntu'. i sure unity will fail to load.
2011-05-17T23:05:00.000Z	satz	archman	then install and see
2011-05-17T23:05:00.000Z	archman	satz	sure, it failed, i've tested already; i mounted the iso with 'mount -o loop' so i'll try it out now
2011-05-17T23:05:00.000Z	archman	satz	hahahah i'm not installing :D just trying for fun
2011-05-17T23:09:00.000Z	satz	archman	what do you mean by custom path?
2011-05-17T23:10:00.000Z	archman	satz	i mean, you can't choose to mount /mnt/loop, in example... you can only choose physical drives and isos..
2011-05-17T23:11:00.000Z	satz	archman	why not use the direct iso file
2011-05-17T23:12:00.000Z	archman	satz	cause i can't mount the vbox additions iso later to install the additions...
2011-05-17T23:12:00.000Z	archman	satz	i've already tried mounting it when ubuntu started, but it went wonky
