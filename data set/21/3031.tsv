2009-07-12T04:38:00.000Z	coleys	owen1	Yes.
2009-07-12T04:39:00.000Z	coleys	owen1	You can install unetbootin from command line if you have jaunty.
2009-07-12T04:39:00.000Z	coleys	owen1	sudo apt-get install unetbootin
2009-07-12T04:41:00.000Z	owen1	coleys	the title say FromUSBStick not usb hard drive..
2009-07-12T04:42:00.000Z	coleys	owen1	It works for harddrives, it specifically has an option for harddrives. =o
2009-07-12T04:45:00.000Z	owen1	coleys	is it possible to install .iso into my usb hard drive? or do i have to burn a CD?
2009-07-12T04:46:00.000Z	coleys	owen1	Unetbootin.
2009-07-12T04:46:00.000Z	coleys	owen1	Unetbootin installs iso to usbs/harddrives, aswell as a bootloader for them, so at boot of your computer you will have the option to boot that device.
2009-07-12T04:46:00.000Z	owen1	coleys	ok. sudo unetbootin.  i'll try it now. btw, i have 2GB partition on my usb drive. it's FAT32. is it ok?
2009-07-12T04:47:00.000Z	coleys	owen1	Yes.
2009-07-12T04:47:00.000Z	coleys	owen1	And the command is... sudo apt-get install unetbootin
2009-07-12T04:49:00.000Z	owen1	coleys	i am doing it now. last time a tried (usb-creator) i got black frozen screen with blinking cursur..
2009-07-12T04:49:00.000Z	coleys	owen1	unetbootin is awesome, I expect sucess. =)
2009-07-12T04:49:00.000Z	owen1	coleys	btw, i've been told it's only working with live cd, so alternat-CD will not work.
2009-07-12T04:51:00.000Z	owen1	coleys	see u soon, i am rebooting
2009-07-12T04:51:00.000Z	coleys	owen1	Okay!
2009-07-12T05:38:00.000Z	owen1	coleys	it's not working on my desktop machine. i was looking at the bios for 'enable external harddrive' option but could'nt find it. i did manage to move the usb hard drive to the top of the boot list. what do u think?
2009-07-12T05:38:00.000Z	owen1	coleys	maybe i can google for the bios version to see if it's supported.
