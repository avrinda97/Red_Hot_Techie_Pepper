2007-04-21T06:21:00.000Z	Jestre		Do I need to have special drivers to allow the Feisty CD to boot if I have an ATI video card?
2007-04-21T06:21:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	Jestre	you shouldn't...
2007-04-21T06:22:00.000Z	Jestre	ciscosurfer	Thanks...  X won't display when I boot and try to install
2007-04-21T06:22:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	Jestre	can you get to a command line?
2007-04-21T06:23:00.000Z	Jestre	ciscosurfer	No
2007-04-21T06:23:00.000Z	Jestre	ciscosurfer	Laptop has Edgy on it now, and I could get to that one, but I want to do a clean install
2007-04-21T06:23:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	Jestre	what happens when you hit the key combo CTRL-ALT-F1 (or F1 thru F6....F7 will bring you back to default)
2007-04-21T06:24:00.000Z	Jestre	ciscosurfer	That's what I tried, nothing happens
2007-04-21T06:24:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	Jestre	hmmm...
2007-04-21T06:24:00.000Z	Jestre	ciscosurfer	If I change the F4-VGA to something unusual, I'll eventually get an Xserver crashed message
2007-04-21T06:24:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	Jestre	have you tried an alternate install CD?
2007-04-21T06:25:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	Jestre	interesting...
2007-04-21T06:25:00.000Z	Jestre	ciscosurfer	Not yet... never had an issue, was wondering if something were different about these.. Kubuntu herd installed on my other one without issue
2007-04-21T06:26:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	Jestre	so here's what I suggest then (if Kubuntu was able to install okay)...install Kubuntu Feisty from CD and then add the ubunt-desktop package (that will pull in Gnome, etc.)....see if that works for you
2007-04-21T06:27:00.000Z	Jestre	ciscosurfer	Okay...  otherwise I can do a normal upgrade via the upgrade-manager if I have to
2007-04-21T06:27:00.000Z	Jestre	ciscosurfer	Just that this'll be the third upgrade like that on this machine, and I wanted to start fresh
2007-04-21T06:27:00.000Z	Jestre	ciscosurfer	Thanks for the ideas
2007-04-21T06:28:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	Jestre	if you do an upgrade, then read the documentation that ubuntu.com has provided...it explains the correct process you should follow to upgrade successfully
2007-04-21T06:28:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	Jestre	sure! any time!
2007-04-21T06:28:00.000Z	Jestre	ciscosurfer	Yeah, about the same as the Dapper -> Edgy upgrade I did on it
2007-04-21T06:28:00.000Z	Jestre	ciscosurfer	Thanks again
