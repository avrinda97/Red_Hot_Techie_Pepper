2007-01-06T12:46:00.000Z	riotkittie		gahhhh. i wish the other half would let me install a distro on the desktop :\
2007-01-06T12:46:00.000Z	dstaudt	riotkittie	i am running an IBM T43 laptop booting off a USB hard drive :)  my internal HD is windows
2007-01-06T12:48:00.000Z	dstaudt	riotkittie	i also ran ubuntu in vmware for a long time on my windows drive, you can run it full screen
2007-01-06T13:15:00.000Z	dstaudt	riotkittie	no, not by default at least
2007-01-06T13:16:00.000Z	dstaudt	riotkittie	what are you trying to accomplish?
2007-01-06T13:18:00.000Z	riotkittie	dstaudt	nothing, really. i am thinking about moving partitions around and adding edgy to the mix
2007-01-06T13:29:00.000Z	dstaudt	riotkittie	cool!  it mounted, but i can't even browse it due to permissions..?
2007-01-06T13:30:00.000Z	riotkittie	dstaudt	>> try something like chmod 755 <dir>
2007-01-06T13:31:00.000Z	dstaudt	riotkittie	failed due to read-only file system!
2007-01-06T13:33:00.000Z	riotkittie	dstaudt	did you try the last one with sudo ?
2007-01-06T13:34:00.000Z	dstaudt	riotkittie	yes
2007-01-06T13:45:00.000Z	riotkittie	dstaudt	> if youre using gnome and want to view the files in nautilus, try  "sudo cd <mountpoint> && sudo gnome-open . "
2007-01-06T13:47:00.000Z	dstaudt	riotkittie	'sudo cd <mount point>' gives: sudo: cd: command not found
2007-01-06T13:51:00.000Z	dstaudt	riotkittie	gnome-open or gksudo nautilus results in an invisible sleeping nautilus instance...i;'m running feisty
2007-01-06T13:52:00.000Z	riotkittie	dstaudt	>> with gnome-open, are you including the "." at the end of that command
2007-01-06T13:53:00.000Z	dstaudt	riotkittie	a "."  ?  no
2007-01-06T13:54:00.000Z	riotkittie	dstaudt	>> try again. "gnome-open ."   the . is important - it signifies the current directory
2007-01-06T13:55:00.000Z	dstaudt	riotkittie	'gnome-open .'   opens a working nautilus in my current directory
2007-01-06T13:55:00.000Z	dstaudt	riotkittie	'sudo gnome-open /media/ntfsvol' hangs
2007-01-06T13:58:00.000Z	dstaudt	riotkittie	so the question is, how to unmount the currently mounting?
2007-01-06T13:59:00.000Z	riotkittie	dstaudt	"sudo umount <mountpoint>
