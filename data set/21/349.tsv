2012-02-19T03:47:00.000Z	Pikkachu		any highlights on how to get this look back in oneiric? http://www.videolog.tv/video.php?id=670508 -- first the cube and floating windows, then maybe emerald decoration
2012-02-19T03:47:00.000Z	Daekdroom	Pikkachu	the cube is not compatible with the Unity shell used by oneiric
2012-02-19T03:48:00.000Z	Pikkachu	Daekdroom	from what I've read, what we'd call 'gnome 3' is actually 'gnome 3 shell', right? and unity is an alternative shell, right?
2012-02-19T03:49:00.000Z	Daekdroom	Pikkachu	Nope. GNOME 3 is Gnome 3. Gnome Shell is a part of it. Unity is a shell alternative but Ubuntu uses Gnome 3 regardless.
2012-02-19T03:49:00.000Z	Daekdroom	Pikkachu	it's possible to install Gnome Shell or Gnome fallback (with the oldschool panel).
2012-02-19T03:49:00.000Z	Pikkachu	Daekdroom	ok so it's just that it's part of it
2012-02-19T03:50:00.000Z	Pikkachu	Daekdroom	I tried the fallback package and the panels looked very weird, with clock in the middle, empty spaces and such
2012-02-19T03:51:00.000Z	Daekdroom	Pikkachu	because it's meant to look like Gnome Shell. There's a way to modify the panel.
2012-02-19T03:51:00.000Z	Daekdroom	Pikkachu	I think Alt + right click
2012-02-19T03:51:00.000Z	Pikkachu	Daekdroom	a way to modify it to look exactly like in the video? alt+ right click? ok will take a look (in windows now)
2012-02-19T03:51:00.000Z	Daekdroom	Pikkachu	not exactly like in the video.
2012-02-19T03:52:00.000Z	Daekdroom	Pikkachu	because some applets are no longer available.
2012-02-19T03:52:00.000Z	Pikkachu	Daekdroom	well I think that's not an issue
2012-02-19T03:52:00.000Z	Pikkachu	Daekdroom	got to memorize, alt+right click....
2012-02-19T03:54:00.000Z	Pikkachu	Daekdroom	wait, what's the difference between the fallback package and gnome shell?
2012-02-19T03:55:00.000Z	Daekdroom	Pikkachu	huh.. GNOME Shell uses graphical acceleration and the fallback package resembles GNOME 2 and doesn't?
2012-02-19T03:59:00.000Z	Pikkachu	Daekdroom	you mean ' GNOME Shell uses graphical acceleration and the fallback package resembles GNOME 2?' (no ' and doesn't')
2012-02-19T04:00:00.000Z	Daekdroom	Pikkachu	Gnome fallback does not need graphical acceleration (but you might use compiz with it)
2012-02-19T04:01:00.000Z	Pikkachu	Daekdroom	ok thanks... so what do you think is better for trying to get that old look back, (fallback + compiz) or gnome-shell?
2012-02-19T04:02:00.000Z	Daekdroom	Pikkachu	you should try Gnome Shell first before trying to work on fallback.
2012-02-19T04:02:00.000Z	Pikkachu	Daekdroom	ok thanks
