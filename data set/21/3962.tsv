2008-08-18T07:36:00.000Z	perillux		is there a way to make a window always stay behind other windows, even when activated?  (possibly with alltray?)
2008-08-18T07:38:00.000Z	carandraug	perillux	you can do the other way. Chose the window you want to be on top and right click on it. CHoose "Always on top"
2008-08-18T07:42:00.000Z	carandraug	perillux	is it the terminal you want in the bottom?
2008-08-18T07:42:00.000Z	carandraug	perillux	sorry, I've seen it is
2008-08-18T07:42:00.000Z	carandraug	perillux	theirs is a program that specifically does that. I'll take a look to see if I find it
2008-08-18T07:42:00.000Z	perillux	carandraug	what do you mean?  the terminal will start up when I log in, and I want it to stay behind other windows
2008-08-18T07:43:00.000Z	perillux	carandraug	ok thanx
2008-08-18T07:43:00.000Z	carandraug	perillux	yes. I've seen one of those things before. It even had transparency so you could see your background
2008-08-18T07:49:00.000Z	carandraug	perillux	I still haven't found what I was talking about since I'm looking for it using keywords (can't remember the name). But take a look at this and see if it's this you may be looking for http://www.linuxhaxor.net/2008/05/01/configuring-linux-terminal-to-work-as-a-transparent-wallpaper-part-1/
2008-08-18T07:51:00.000Z	perillux	carandraug	ya I saw that.  But the first option (tilda) doesn't work right, the text gets messed up when I maximize/minimize windows.  and the second option is probably my best bet.  But the terminal doesn't go ALL the way down to the bottom of my screen.  :(  I made a 3rd option which looks good, but it doesn't stay behind other windows.  Anyway, I'll probably just go with the second option (devilspie) in that link you sent.
2008-08-18T07:58:00.000Z	carandraug	perillux	I kept looking for it but I can't find it. I saw lots of people doing that kind of stuff but none using Gnome (at least that's what it seemed to me). Have you tried a gnome channel and ask it there?
2008-08-18T07:59:00.000Z	carandraug	perillux	on a second thought, maybe a metacity channel would be more adequate
2008-08-18T07:59:00.000Z	perillux	carandraug	maybe I'll try later.  It's ok, thanks for your help
2008-08-18T08:01:00.000Z	perillux	carandraug	I got it.  I just had to switch to Compiz, and then I enabled "window rules" and in the "below" section I added "gnome-terminal"  :)
2008-08-18T08:02:00.000Z	carandraug	perillux	nice go
2008-08-18T08:05:00.000Z	perillux	carandraug	winrid: even better, since I use alltray, I set it to if it has (AllTray) in the title.  That way, other terminal windows can still go on top, but my background terminal won't
2008-08-18T08:09:00.000Z	carandraug	perillux	add an & after the command
2008-08-18T08:10:00.000Z	carandraug	perillux	for example, gedit /path_to_file &
2008-08-18T08:29:00.000Z	carandraug	perillux	did you manage to work out the & in the end of the command?
2008-08-23T07:28:00.000Z	carandraug	perillux	look in ~/.local/share/Trash
2008-08-23T07:28:00.000Z	perillux	carandraug	that did it, thanks
