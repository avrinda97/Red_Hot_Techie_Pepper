2006-08-09T16:20:00.000Z	Tonren		Dammit... Photoshop won't run.
2006-08-09T16:21:00.000Z	azcazandco	Tonren	I am trying really hard to avoid it
2006-08-09T16:22:00.000Z	Tonren	azcazandco	Me too... but Photoshop is the ONLY thing keeping me.  I've even gotten my favorite games (Cave Story, Starcraft and Jedi Academy) to run in Linux.
2006-08-09T16:22:00.000Z	azcazandco	Tonren	I am a web developer and am having masive issues with tiem spent trying to relearn
2006-08-09T16:22:00.000Z	Tonren	azcazandco	Me too.  Actually, one of the big reasons I moved to Linux is because I can run a LAMP server on my dev box.
2006-08-09T16:23:00.000Z	azcazandco	Tonren	I am trying the vmware thing but getting lost, got a copy of phtoshop 6 but it wont run under wine in dapper

2006-08-09T16:26:00.000Z	Tonren	azcazandco	Cool.  I'll look int oit.
2006-08-09T16:28:00.000Z	Tonren	azcazandco	What d you think holds Pixel back right now?
2006-08-09T16:29:00.000Z	azcazandco	Tonren	how long you been in linux?
