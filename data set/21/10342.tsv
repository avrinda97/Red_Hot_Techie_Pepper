2005-03-29T12:50:00.000Z	kotatsu		hard to beat gstreamer for media conversion though... was playing with it the other day
2005-03-29T12:50:00.000Z	knudsen_	kotatsu	I cannot even play an mpeg-file with totem ...
2005-03-29T12:51:00.000Z	kotatsu	knudsen_	do you have totem-xine installed?
2005-03-29T12:51:00.000Z	knudsen_	kotatsu	If I install totem-xine, totem wont start ...
2005-03-29T12:52:00.000Z	knudsen_	kotatsu	I wonder why it worked when I made an installation some days ago ...
2005-03-29T12:52:00.000Z	kotatsu	knudsen_	not sure - try running it on a command line and see if you get error messages
2005-03-29T12:52:00.000Z	knudsen_	kotatsu	believe it or not: It lacks libnautilus-cdburn.so.0 (or something like that)
2005-03-29T12:53:00.000Z	kotatsu	knudsen_	uh... for burning CDs in totem? I don't follow
2005-03-29T12:54:00.000Z	kotatsu	knudsen_	if you can get the output from totem I might be able to help you track down the problem
2005-03-29T12:55:00.000Z	knudsen_	kotatsu	It simply says "cannot find shared library libnautilus-burncd.so.0" (or cdburn, I do not remember)
2005-03-29T12:56:00.000Z	kotatsu	knudsen_	does that file exist on your system?
2005-03-29T12:56:00.000Z	knudsen_	kotatsu	I'll take a look ... to sec
2005-03-29T12:57:00.000Z	knudsen_	kotatsu	The right message is: "totem: error while loading shared libraries: libnautilus-burn.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2005-03-29T13:00:00.000Z	kotatsu	knudsen_	does /usr/lib/libnautilus-burn.so.0 exist on your system?
2005-03-29T13:01:00.000Z	knudsen_	kotatsu	there are files called blablabla.1 and blablabla.1.0.0 but not blablabla.0
2005-03-29T13:01:00.000Z	kotatsu	knudsen_	using hoary?
2005-03-29T13:01:00.000Z	knudsen_	kotatsu	I am using 5.04
2005-03-29T13:02:00.000Z	kotatsu	knudsen_	totem shouldn't be looking for .0 then.... try $ sudo apt-get install --reinstall totem-xine libnautilus-burn1
2005-03-29T13:03:00.000Z	knudsen_	kotatsu	it's still the same. ..
2005-03-29T13:03:00.000Z	kotatsu	knudsen_	hmmm, not sure... if you make a symlink of the correct name does it work?
2005-03-29T13:05:00.000Z	knudsen_	kotatsu	It get's even more strange: totem: relocation error: totem: undefined symbol: bacon_cd_selection_new
