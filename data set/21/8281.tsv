2006-05-11T05:54:00.000Z	NoobSauce		does anyone have comparisons of writing to ipod from itunes versus from something in linux? which is faster? (wondering if I should run wine+itunes on linux)
2006-05-11T05:55:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	NoobSauce	unless you have some FairPlay DRM'd songs, I'd go with rhythmbox or equivalent
2006-05-11T05:56:00.000Z	NoobSauce	RandolphCarter	is there any program to strip the DRM from the songs?
2006-05-11T05:56:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	NoobSauce	there's a windows/osx app, but it'll only work for <= iTunes 5.00 stuff
2006-05-12T05:55:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	NoobSauce	you need to install an SMP kernel
2006-05-12T05:55:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	NoobSauce	assuming you're using an AMD dual core, try 'sudo aptitude install linux-k7-smp'
2006-05-12T05:55:00.000Z	NoobSauce	RandolphCarter	what's the difference between an SMP kernel and i386?
2006-05-12T05:56:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	NoobSauce	SMP =multi-processing :)
2006-05-12T05:56:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	NoobSauce	probably, almost definitely, yes
2006-05-12T05:57:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	NoobSauce	if you installed it using the ubuntu packages you shouldn't have much of a problem though
2006-05-12T05:58:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	NoobSauce	yes, no way around it, SMP = more than one CPU
2006-05-12T05:58:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	NoobSauce	if you're using the ubuntu Nvidia drivers though (didn't install your own by hand), you shouldn't even notice the change though
2006-05-12T06:00:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	NoobSauce	k7 is 32-bit
2006-05-12T06:00:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	NoobSauce	k8 is 64-bit
2006-05-12T06:01:00.000Z	NoobSauce	RandolphCarter	slackern ok, I guess it's time to upgrade the kernel... I had compiz+xgl working on this install and if I have to reset it up again, I'm gonna be really mad
2006-05-12T06:01:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	NoobSauce	so long as you've done things "the ubuntu way", you shouldn't have a problem
2006-05-12T06:01:00.000Z	NoobSauce	RandolphCarter	how do I change the kernel anyways?
2006-05-12T06:02:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	NoobSauce	just do 'sudo aptitude install linux-k7-smp' at a terminal
2006-05-12T06:02:00.000Z	NoobSauce	RandolphCarter	what's the difference between aptitude and apt-get?
2006-05-12T06:03:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	NoobSauce	not much, aptitude was (a few years back when I first learned this), the newer way of doing things though
2006-05-12T06:03:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	NoobSauce	so it stuck with me ^_^ use what you prefer
