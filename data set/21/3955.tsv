2012-04-01T00:50:00.000Z	AzizLight	guntbert	http://pastie.org/private/ktbddih54r1lcgx1serg << ls -ld ~
2012-04-01T00:53:00.000Z	guntbert	AzizLight	there is something strange there, but  it should not matter in your case  - show us the output of    ls -l  ~    too

2012-04-01T00:56:00.000Z	guntbert	AzizLight	what system is that? only one folder (and that owned by root) and no folders?
2012-04-01T00:58:00.000Z	AzizLight	guntbert	it's ubuntu 10.04, a new system so nothing in the home folder except for this folder created by capistrano
2012-04-01T00:59:00.000Z	guntbert	AzizLight	who or what is capistrano?
2012-04-01T00:59:00.000Z	AzizLight	guntbert	it's a ruby gem to deploy apps
2012-04-01T01:01:00.000Z	guntbert	AzizLight	ok, back to your problem - try       touch somefile     in your home dir    -  I expect an error again
2012-04-01T01:03:00.000Z	AzizLight	guntbert	it was a misconfiguration of capistrano, the touch command worked and the mkdir worked too now
2012-04-01T01:03:00.000Z	AzizLight	guntbert	thanks for your help though ;)
2012-04-01T01:03:00.000Z	guntbert	AzizLight	glad you made it  - sometimes it helps just to talk about the problem  :-))
2012-04-01T01:04:00.000Z	AzizLight	guntbert	I agree lol
2012-05-24T00:00:00.000Z	guntbert	AzizLight	both are - one with gnome the other with gtk --   see /msg ubottu info vim-gnome
2012-05-24T00:12:00.000Z	AzizLight	guntbert	thanks alot. With the latest ubuntu which do you think I should get ?
2012-05-24T00:12:00.000Z	guntbert	AzizLight	I'd says try them both and keep what you like better
2012-05-24T00:13:00.000Z	AzizLight	guntbert	ok thanks, I won't actually use the gui, I use terminal vim, but apparently the gui is a dependency for janus. ...
2012-05-24T00:15:00.000Z	guntbert	AzizLight	wait, if you want only vim for CLI there may be another one too
2012-05-24T00:15:00.000Z	guntbert	AzizLight	try vim :-)
2012-05-24T00:16:00.000Z	AzizLight	guntbert	yeah I know I already install "just vim" ;) But I always get confused with the two versions of gvim
2012-05-24T00:17:00.000Z	guntbert	AzizLight	there is "just" gvim too :-)
