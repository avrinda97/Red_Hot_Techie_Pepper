2004-10-06T05:54:00.000Z	mike_w		hmm.. my system just locked up, totally unresponsive. dunno what caused it (!)
2004-10-06T05:55:00.000Z	mike_w		;(
2004-10-06T05:55:00.000Z	azeem	mike_w	perhaps there's something in /var/log/ after you reboot which gives you hints
2004-10-06T05:59:00.000Z	mike_w	azeem	sorry, fairly new to linux. There are some errors in syslog though (e.g. Device 'i823650' does not have a release() function, it is broken and must be fixed.
2004-10-06T06:00:00.000Z	azeem	mike_w	did you reboot in the meantime?
2004-10-06T06:00:00.000Z	mike_w	azeem	just rebooted 2 mins ago (had to use the reset button)
2004-10-06T06:01:00.000Z	mike_w	azeem	bottom of file? top of file?
2004-10-06T06:02:00.000Z	azeem	mike_w	towards, the bottom, but all the way at the bottom, all the messages from the last reboot will be
2004-10-06T06:02:00.000Z	azeem	mike_w	so go to the bottom, and back from there
2004-10-06T06:03:00.000Z	mike_w	azeem	how bout this? [fglrx:firegl_unlock]  *ERROR* Process 4666 using kernel context 0
2004-10-06T06:05:00.000Z	azeem	mike_w	well, if this is the last you see in the log (followed by something like 'Syslog restart') it is good enough to file a bug report
2004-10-06T06:07:00.000Z	mike_w	azeem	that error was after syslogd 1.4.1#14ubuntu4: restart.
2004-10-06T06:09:00.000Z	azeem	mike_w	hmm
2004-10-06T06:09:00.000Z	azeem	mike_w	well, with 'after' you mean 'further towards the end of the file', right?
2004-10-06T06:10:00.000Z	mike_w	azeem	yeah - I seem to get that error each boot, it maybe wasn't what locked the system?
2004-10-06T06:18:00.000Z	azeem	mike_w	one thing you could do is try to login via SSH, if you have access to a computer which is networked to your box
2004-10-06T06:56:00.000Z	azeem	mike_w	update-rc.d is the Debian way
2004-10-06T06:58:00.000Z	mike_w	azeem	how would I use update-rc.d to add a service to be started at boot?
2004-10-06T06:58:00.000Z	azeem	mike_w	there's an manpage, 'man update-rc.d'
2004-10-06T06:58:00.000Z	azeem	mike_w	rcconf might be easier, dunno
2004-10-06T06:59:00.000Z	mike_w	azeem	thanks
