2011-08-17T01:17:00.000Z	battlehands		I just installed ubuntu and updated to the current version.  To test my sound I visited a youtube video of vivian cambell playing a guitar solo.  In order to view the video I needed to install a flash plugin.  I dowloaded it and extracted it to my Downloads folder.  How do I complete the installation from there?
2011-08-17T01:19:00.000Z	recon69_lap	battlehands	let me introduce the package manager in system , you'll wonder why installing software was ever done differently
2011-08-17T01:19:00.000Z	battlehands	recon69_lap	 continue
2011-08-17T01:20:00.000Z	recon69_lap	battlehands	find your packet manager, i'm not on 11.04 so cant direct you, look for admin programs or system menu
2011-08-17T01:27:00.000Z	recon69_lap	battlehands	try play a couple of sound files, you probably missing a few codecs
2011-08-17T01:28:00.000Z	recon69_lap	battlehands	mp3 is not opensource so is not installed by default
2011-08-17T01:31:00.000Z	battlehands	recon69_lap	but shouldnt my sound work by default?
2011-08-17T01:32:00.000Z	recon69_lap	battlehands	if your sound card is detected correctly, and you play a open format it will. babaei is pointing you to the correct way to test
2011-08-17T01:33:00.000Z	recon69_lap	battlehands	check the volume level, is mute selected
2011-08-17T01:33:00.000Z	battlehands	recon69_lap	no, nothing is muted
2011-08-17T01:35:00.000Z	recon69_lap	battlehands	work through this  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingSoundProblems
2011-08-17T01:37:00.000Z	battlehands	recon69_lap	still no sound.  I will work through that article
2011-08-17T02:10:00.000Z	battlehands	recon69_lap	I went through the help page and still have no sound
2011-08-17T02:11:00.000Z	battlehands	recon69_lap	I used the audio debugger and left my bug on launchpad for the develper team
2011-08-17T02:12:00.000Z	recon69_lap	battlehands	seems you got a bug. do you have a link to the bug report
2011-08-17T02:15:00.000Z	battlehands	recon69_lap	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/827675
2011-08-17T02:16:00.000Z	recon69_lap	battlehands	hmm, did you answer 'no' to did you hear a sound question
2011-08-17T02:16:00.000Z	recon69_lap	battlehands	and then fill out a bug report
2011-08-17T02:16:00.000Z	battlehands	recon69_lap	 yes
2011-08-17T02:17:00.000Z	recon69_lap	battlehands	lol, well could still be anything, that bug report is just what you typed in, testing did nothing but show that you are not hearing anything, you might have gone deaf :P
