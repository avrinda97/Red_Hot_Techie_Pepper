2010-10-17T11:38:00.000Z	ibrahim-kasem		I bought a new hp printer p1005 when I am using windows the stupid printer works perfectly but on my juanty sometimes it doesnt print at all or most of the times. what should I do please? :(
2010-10-17T11:38:00.000Z	spinningcompass	ibrahim-kasem	Does the HP P1005 understand Postscript?
2010-10-17T11:39:00.000Z	ibrahim-kasem	spinningcompass	How can I know this please?
2010-10-17T11:39:00.000Z	spinningcompass	ibrahim-kasem	Your printer should come with a manual. In the back, it will list the languages that the printer can understand.
2010-10-17T11:39:00.000Z	spinningcompass	ibrahim-kasem	Typically, HP printers understand HCL and Postscript (if memory serves me correctly).
2010-10-17T11:42:00.000Z	ibrahim-kasem	spinningcompass	 This is what I know, also sometimes it works!
2010-10-17T11:42:00.000Z	ibrahim-kasem	spinningcompass	I am searching for its manual.
2010-10-17T11:42:00.000Z	spinningcompass	ibrahim-kasem	Good. :) Can you send a test page to the printer from your Linux box? Does the test page print?
2010-10-17T11:43:00.000Z	ibrahim-kasem	spinningcompass	Now it doesn't but some times it does!
2010-10-17T11:43:00.000Z	spinningcompass	ibrahim-kasem	Does the printer beep or flash? Perhaps there's a check box - "Pause before new page" or something - which must be checked in the driver.
2010-10-17T11:44:00.000Z	ibrahim-kasem	spinningcompass	The light is always green,
2010-10-17T11:45:00.000Z	ibrahim-kasem	spinningcompass	I am reading its manual and Linux is not in the supported OS list.
2010-10-17T11:52:00.000Z	ibrahim-kasem	spinningcompass	 How can I activate "Pause before new page" please? where can i find this option?
2010-10-17T11:53:00.000Z	ibrahim-kasem	spinningcompass	Where can I find this box please? "Pause before new page"
2010-10-17T11:54:00.000Z	spinningcompass	ibrahim-kasem	Which printer driver is Ubuntu currently using?
2010-10-17T11:54:00.000Z	ibrahim-kasem	spinningcompass	Am sorry I don't know which one! how can I know this as well.
2010-10-17T11:55:00.000Z	spinningcompass	ibrahim-kasem	From your Ubuntu main menu, select System, then choose Administration. Under the Administration menu, you will find an icon labeled Printing. Select this tool and within several seconds the Printer Configuration Tool will open.
2010-10-17T11:57:00.000Z	ibrahim-kasem	spinningcompass	after "printing" what should I do please?
