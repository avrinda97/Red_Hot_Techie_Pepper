2010-04-06T03:49:00.000Z	amen51		Hi all, a question: I once made the mistake of saving my gnome session. Although, I have disabled it (a long time age), every time I restart the system, I get the same application. Is there a cache, ... somewhere that I should remove?
2010-04-06T03:50:00.000Z	amen51		for example, fetchmail
2010-04-06T03:50:00.000Z	amen51		i would like to restart the fetchmail daemon each time a restart

2010-04-06T03:54:00.000Z	kjele	amen51	rm -r ~/config/gnome-session
2010-04-06T03:54:00.000Z	kjele	amen51	rm -r ~/.config/gnome-session
2010-04-06T03:55:00.000Z	amen51	kjele	thanks!
2010-04-06T03:56:00.000Z	amen51	kjele	i am gonna try it, hopefully it works
2010-04-06T03:57:00.000Z	amen51	kjele	there is also a ~/.config/session-state, shouldn't I remove that too?
2010-04-06T03:57:00.000Z	amen51	kjele	could you check if yours is empty?
2010-04-06T03:57:00.000Z	kjele	amen51	delete that too.
2010-04-06T03:58:00.000Z	amen51	kjele	okay thanks again
2010-04-06T03:59:00.000Z	kjele	amen51	You also have a autostart if you have added stuff
2010-04-06T04:00:00.000Z	amen51	kjele	what do you mean?
2010-04-06T04:00:00.000Z	amen51	kjele	I have added things like fetchmail and conky to startup programs in gnome "Startup Applications Pereferences" dialog
2010-04-06T04:00:00.000Z	kjele	amen51	If you do not have that folder then it is ok
2010-04-06T04:01:00.000Z	amen51	kjele	i used to work just fine, until I saved the session once ....
2010-04-06T04:01:00.000Z	amen51	kjele	okay
2010-04-06T04:01:00.000Z	kjele	amen51	Then it is in your autostart folder.
2010-04-06T04:02:00.000Z	kjele	amen51	~/.config/autostart
2010-04-06T04:02:00.000Z	kjele	amen51	It is fine then. Try to relog then
