2009-10-08T00:49:00.000Z	te		read the bug reports if you want
2009-10-08T00:50:00.000Z	te		dude.  people in here use ubuntu-- and i had to hunt for this bug without much to go on, i found what the deal is, so im sharing that information
2009-10-08T00:50:00.000Z	te		AHCI or Compatability?
2009-10-08T00:51:00.000Z	te		no.. no you're running AHCI
2009-10-08T00:51:00.000Z	te		AHCI = works, compatability = massive corruption every time
2009-10-08T00:51:00.000Z	te		i dare you to switch to compat.
2009-10-08T00:51:00.000Z	te		if you think im overexaggerating

2009-10-08T00:53:00.000Z	te	nutterpc	run fsck from the command line using a live cd with the disk unmounted and see if you have the slow filesystem corruption happening to you
2009-10-08T00:53:00.000Z	te		it's worth checking out
