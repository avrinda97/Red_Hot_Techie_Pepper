2007-02-14T17:41:00.000Z	th1	trippen	if it works you can use any package that uses lm-sensors as a backend
2007-02-14T17:41:00.000Z	th1	trippen	have you looked at /etc/sensors.conf?
2007-02-14T17:43:00.000Z	trippen	th1	i opened /etc/sensors.conf but it has a ton of stuff in there i dont know what any of it is
2007-02-14T17:45:00.000Z	th1	trippen	try "sudo sensors-detect"
