2008-11-22T12:12:00.000Z	Tim183		can I get some help please? I'm having trouble with my wifi connection. I can see all the available connections in networkmanager, but i can't connect. (the networks I have tried were all open networks) - PM me if anyone can help, thanks
2008-11-22T12:14:00.000Z	fenerli7	Tim183	the network manager is a bit screwy with finalising wireless connections, I sometimes get into a closer range and then move back away
2008-11-22T12:28:00.000Z	fenerli7	Tim183	does getting closer to the access point (probably a router) help?
2008-11-22T12:29:00.000Z	Tim183	fenerli7	i am sitting about 4 metres from it
2008-11-22T13:32:00.000Z	fenerli7	Tim183	manual text file configuration? there was also one other one besides nm and wicd but it wasn't any better
2008-11-22T13:34:00.000Z	Tim183	fenerli7	ah ok, yes I tried to connect via command line (terminal) http://paste.ubuntu.com/75562/
2008-11-22T13:35:00.000Z	fenerli7	Tim183	lol, i had that exact thing 1 year and a bit ago, the only solution I had found was static DHCP
2008-11-22T13:35:00.000Z	fenerli7	Tim183	it fixed up with something in hardy or gutsy though
2008-11-22T13:35:00.000Z	Tim183	fenerli7	how does that work?
2008-11-22T13:36:00.000Z	fenerli7	Tim183	just specify your local address as 192.168.0.x and maybe do the same on your router
2008-11-22T13:36:00.000Z	Tim183	fenerli7	i could go back to hardy if needed
2008-11-22T13:36:00.000Z	fenerli7	Tim183	it worked in hardy but not intrepid?
2008-11-22T13:36:00.000Z	Tim183	fenerli7	sorry, im a bit of a newbie, could you help me with that?
2008-11-22T13:37:00.000Z	fenerli7	Tim183	sorry, it's been a long time since i done any of that and can't remember, and don't really have the time to look it up
2008-11-22T13:37:00.000Z	Tim183	fenerli7	it worked in hardy about 5 months ago, then i did an upgrade in hardy and ive had this issue since
2008-11-22T14:19:00.000Z	fenerli7	Tim183	network adapter type/brand?
2008-11-22T14:21:00.000Z	Tim183	fenerli7	its an atheros ar5007eg, i know that model has its issues.... i can see the available networks but cannot connect, I went today and bought a USB dongle (netgear wg111v3), but i got the same result there
2008-11-22T14:22:00.000Z	fenerli7	Tim183	can you try on a live CD or a fresh install? often, people break existing things and even new compatible hardware won't work
2008-11-22T14:23:00.000Z	Tim183	fenerli7	the only thing i have done is loaded the madwifi svn module to fire the atheros card up
2008-11-22T14:23:00.000Z	Tim183	fenerli7	and the usb dongle was recognised out of the box, but wont conenct either
2008-11-22T14:28:00.000Z	Tim183	fenerli7	i placed a post on the forum http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=989800 see if anyone can help
