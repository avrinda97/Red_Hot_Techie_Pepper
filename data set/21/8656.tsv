2006-02-23T08:00:00.000Z	surferdude		Does anyone know if (K)ubuntu is better with higher resolutions?
2006-02-23T08:01:00.000Z	wastrel	surferdude	 it would be the same
2006-02-23T08:01:00.000Z	wastrel	surferdude	 are you sure your monitor supports higher resolutions?
2006-02-23T08:01:00.000Z	surferdude		Wastrel: In Windows XP 1024x768 works fine
2006-02-23T08:02:00.000Z	wastrel	surferdude	 ok you need to edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.
2006-02-23T08:02:00.000Z	surferdude		I know
2006-02-23T08:02:00.000Z	wastrel	surferdude	 ok, well that's a start :] 
2006-02-23T08:02:00.000Z	surferdude		I added a subsection to display
2006-02-23T08:02:00.000Z	wastrel		added
2006-02-23T08:03:00.000Z	surferdude		and went back into prefrences, to try to change the resolution
2006-02-23T08:03:00.000Z	surferdude		but it still wont budge
2006-02-23T08:03:00.000Z	wastrel	surferdude	 did you restart the X server in between?
2006-02-23T08:03:00.000Z	wastrel	surferdude	 log out & log back in again should work
2006-02-23T08:03:00.000Z	surferdude		ok...

2006-02-23T08:08:00.000Z	surferdude		Heres my xorg.conf: http://pastebin.com/560545
2006-02-23T08:08:00.000Z	surferdude		maybe I'm doing somthing wrong?
2006-02-23T08:10:00.000Z	wastrel	surferdude	 remove that stuff you added :]
