2006-12-10T17:21:00.000Z	XiXaQ		I need to have a http proxy. What should I get?
2006-12-10T12:30:00.000Z	XiXaQ		hmm, I have a public_html folder in my home. However, when I add new files, I must manually change permissions for them. How can I fix this?
2006-12-10T12:30:00.000Z	dabaR	XiXaQ	what does umask in a temrinal show?
2006-12-10T12:31:00.000Z	dabaR	XiXaQ	run umask in a terminal and tell us what it showed you
2006-12-10T12:31:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dabaR	on the public_html directory, or what?
2006-12-10T12:32:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dabaR	umask alone shows 0022
2006-12-10T12:32:00.000Z	dabaR	XiXaQ	just type umask when you get to a command prompt
2006-12-10T12:32:00.000Z	dabaR	XiXaQ	then all files you create will have 644 permissions if they are text files.
2006-12-10T12:32:00.000Z	dabaR	XiXaQ	what exactly do you do now?
2006-12-10T12:34:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dabaR	I copy a file into the public_html directory, then I open nautilus, rightclick public_html, properties, select permissions, grant others the right to read the files and apply permissions to enclosed files.
2006-12-10T12:34:00.000Z	dabaR	XiXaQ	and where do you copy the file from and how do you create it?
2006-12-10T12:35:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dabaR	I copy the file from elsewhere. Either my home-dir, another drive, email account..
2006-12-10T12:36:00.000Z	dabaR	XiXaQ	it seems to me that when you create a file in a terminal it has fine permissions for readability. maybe your other way of creating files is the one to blame...
2006-12-10T12:36:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dabaR	creating files? Rightclick, copy, paste?
2006-12-10T12:37:00.000Z	dabaR	XiXaQ	a paste never created a file, did it?
2006-12-10T12:37:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dabaR	that's what _I'm_ talking about...
2006-12-10T12:38:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dabaR	I think the problem is with apache...
2006-12-10T12:41:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dabaR	I figured it out: I needed to have an empty file named .htaccess in the directory.
2006-12-10T12:41:00.000Z	dabaR	XiXaQ	maybe.
2006-12-19T06:43:00.000Z	dabaR	XiXaQ	you could try asking on #ubuntu-marketing
2006-12-19T06:43:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dabaR	that's a great advise. Thanks. :)
