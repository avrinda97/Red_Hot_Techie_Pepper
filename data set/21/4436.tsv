2012-05-20T08:07:00.000Z	Ted_		hi, I was hoping I could ask what seems like a pretty simple questionâ€¦  I've successfully created a live USB to boot from on my Intel MacbookPro, but I wanted to find out if there was any way for me to actually install ubuntu on this stick - It's 16 gb, and it's currently formatted FAT using diskutility on my mac.  Every time I've tried, I've gotten various errors - I just want to be able to...
2012-05-20T08:07:00.000Z	Ted_		...load the drive using ReFit and boot it as if it was an internal partition, thanks
2012-05-20T08:08:00.000Z	Ted_		(Tried asking in beginners, because I definitely am, but didn't get any response)
2012-05-20T08:09:00.000Z	Ted_		That's what I thought - however, I've also made a live CD - so if I booted from the CD, would I be able to successfully install on the usb?
2012-05-20T08:11:00.000Z	Ted_		I have everything backed up - I'm pretty much expecting to accidentally format my HD
2012-05-20T08:11:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	good idea, I did that to myself last week
2012-05-20T08:14:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	"swap" is a format type
2012-05-20T08:14:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	you also need a partition for your root (called "/")
2012-05-20T08:14:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	I suggest you format as ext4
2012-05-20T08:15:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	and if you want, what I normally do is give 50GB to the root and the rest to /home
2012-05-20T08:15:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	with swap getting twice my ram
2012-05-20T08:15:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	you are installing on a mac?
2012-05-20T08:20:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	so do it :-)
2012-05-20T08:21:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	make a partition mounted at / that is ext4 and takes up the entire drive
2012-05-20T08:22:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	(a GB of swap is not very useful)
2012-05-20T08:22:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	unless you plan to run this on machine with very little ram
2012-05-20T08:22:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	swap only matters when you run out of ram
2012-05-20T08:23:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	and it reduces the life of your flash drive
2012-05-20T08:23:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	not unless your machine has under a GB of ram
2012-05-20T08:23:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	that is what I would do
2012-05-20T08:24:00.000Z	smw	Ted_	actually, less than 2GB I would use swap :-)
