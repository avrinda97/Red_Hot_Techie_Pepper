2009-11-05T16:48:00.000Z	S4nD3r		Please, help me to solve this problem http://pastebin.com/d3d9cfbb3
2009-11-05T16:50:00.000Z	geekbuntu	S4nD3r	you do not have all the python libraries - well, the one you need ImportError: cannot import name _gtk
2009-11-05T16:50:00.000Z	geekbuntu	S4nD3r	two choices.... reinstall or look at lines 10-14 it's telling you what it can't find and paths
2009-11-05T16:52:00.000Z	S4nD3r	geekbuntu	where is those lines?
2009-11-05T16:52:00.000Z	geekbuntu	S4nD3r	in the paste link you just sent
2009-11-05T16:58:00.000Z	S4nD3r	geekbuntu	ok. line 10-14
2009-11-05T16:58:00.000Z	geekbuntu	S4nD3r	it's saying it cannot find gtk and ubuntulooks
2009-11-05T16:58:00.000Z	geekbuntu	S4nD3r	try installing them
2009-11-05T17:00:00.000Z	geekbuntu	S4nD3r	if this worked, what would it be doing?
2009-11-05T17:00:00.000Z	geekbuntu	S4nD3r	what is it?
2009-11-05T17:01:00.000Z	geekbuntu	S4nD3r	scroll up - asked two ?'s
2009-11-05T17:03:00.000Z	S4nD3r	geekbuntu	http://pastebin.com/d59e5b87d
2009-11-05T17:05:00.000Z	geekbuntu	S4nD3r	that installed one pkg - it didn't address everything http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-530773.html
2009-11-05T17:08:00.000Z	geekbuntu	S4nD3r	if that does not fix your problem it looks like that's the end of the google trail - not sure which version of ubuntu you're running (guessing you upgraded to karmic and now your themes don't work) - they're still working through a ton of issues it appears
2009-11-05T17:08:00.000Z	S4nD3r	geekbuntu	the problems are not the themes
2009-11-05T17:11:00.000Z	S4nD3r	geekbuntu	 Look it   http://pastebin.com/d515c0d7a
2009-11-05T17:12:00.000Z	geekbuntu	S4nD3r	did you try upgraded to the version in the paste?
2009-11-05T17:14:00.000Z	geekbuntu	S4nD3r	it says you didn't install it... try installing python-glade2  i think you're confused between ubuntu pkgs and python
2009-11-05T17:15:00.000Z	geekbuntu	S4nD3r	sudu-apt - i saw you did that on another paste
2009-11-05T17:18:00.000Z	geekbuntu	S4nD3r	i look through synaptic and i see so many variations of gtk+   your errors range from python to glade2 and keep going - i've tried to understand (asked some questions that never got answered). maybe googling the errors will show you which library you need to install (which pkg to install to get which library)
2009-11-05T17:19:00.000Z	S4nD3r	geekbuntu	back in 5 minutos
