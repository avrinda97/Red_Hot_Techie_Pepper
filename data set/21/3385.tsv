2009-01-08T15:36:00.000Z	Marquis-Boy		Can anyone help me work out why I am getting this error when trying to sudo mount -a:   "mount error 20 = Not a directory"
2009-01-08T15:38:00.000Z	oCean_	Marquis-Boy	probably typo in /etc/fstab file? Since mount -a mounts all filesystems mentioned in /etc/fstab, using the arguments specified in that file
2009-01-08T15:39:00.000Z	Marquis-Boy		ocean:   don't think so. My fstab says: //10.1.1.16/media1  /media/media1  cifs username=guest,password=,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8,codepage=unicode,unicode  0  0
2009-01-08T15:39:00.000Z	Marquis-Boy		perl - nope
2009-01-08T15:40:00.000Z	oCean_	Marquis-Boy	to verify that the error is (or isn't) on that line, you might want to try "mount -t cifs -a"
2009-01-08T15:41:00.000Z	Marquis-Boy		oCean - still get the error
2009-01-08T15:42:00.000Z	oCean_	Marquis-Boy	ah.. what are you trying to mount?
2009-01-08T15:42:00.000Z	Marquis-Boy		an smb shared nas drive
2009-01-08T15:43:00.000Z	oCean_	Marquis-Boy	ok, and *your* directory /media/media1 exists?
2009-01-08T15:43:00.000Z	Marquis-Boy		yep...
2009-01-08T15:44:00.000Z	oCean_	Marquis-Boy	hmmm.. cifs module is loaded? (lsmod | grep cif)
2009-01-08T15:45:00.000Z	Marquis-Boy		oCean: response is "cifs                  259984  0"
2009-01-08T15:46:00.000Z	oCean_	Marquis-Boy	oke, so it *is* loaded. Hmmm...
2009-01-08T15:47:00.000Z	Marquis-Boy		oCean Yup. I think it is to do wth user ids and permissions.  But there are no passwords set on the drive itself
2009-01-08T15:48:00.000Z	oCean_	Marquis-Boy	oke, in your options you specify password= Since you're not using that, pls try mounting without that option?
2009-01-08T15:49:00.000Z	Marquis-Boy		oCean: will do. I tried that before though. following this link: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently
2009-01-08T15:52:00.000Z	Marquis-Boy		oC: change FSTAB to //10.1.1.16/media1  /media/media1  cifs uid=1000,iocharset=utf8,codepage=unicode,unicode  0  0     yields same results
2009-01-08T15:53:00.000Z	Marquis-Boy	yanz	- what location?
2009-01-08T15:53:00.000Z	oCean_	Marquis-Boy	well, I'm running out of options then..
2009-01-08T15:53:00.000Z	Marquis-Boy		oCean - yeah, me too. Tis wierd.
2009-01-08T15:55:00.000Z	oCean_	Marquis-Boy	there's one more thing you might want to try. A long-shot maybe.... Try "echo 0 > /proc/fs/cifs/LinuxExtensionsEnabled" (It's probably 1 right now)
