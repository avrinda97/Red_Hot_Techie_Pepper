2012-08-10T07:05:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	AceLaptop	That script is from the grub wiki.
2012-08-10T07:11:00.000Z	AceLaptop	wilee-nilee	so I don't need boot-repair for this?
2012-08-10T07:13:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	AceLaptop	my pastebin that is use the wiki you will see the same commands except for the added partition numbers, etc and the purge and reinstall.  THe bootrepair does not instal grub you are missing it.
2012-08-10T07:15:00.000Z	AceLaptop	wilee-nilee	same error using the line from that link
2012-08-10T07:16:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	AceLaptop	I would crtl d to unmount and try again, check in gparted to see if the sda1 is unmounted before trying again
2012-08-10T07:18:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	AceLaptop	It was strange that grub was completely gone, there may be more problems then just a missing grub set up it is hard for me to say.
2012-08-10T07:19:00.000Z	AceLaptop	wilee-nilee	you want my drive to be unmounted?
2012-08-10T07:20:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	AceLaptop	the partition sda1, was the only thing that should of been mounted.
2012-08-10T07:21:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	AceLaptop	I'm suggesting you unmount then try again using that partitcular command from the wiki.
2012-08-10T07:23:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	AceLaptop	Every time I have needed to chroot in which is what you are doing to run the purge and reinstall and load the mbr it has worked for me, so beyongd that I'm not sure
2012-08-10T07:24:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	AceLaptop	from the ctrl d or gparted?
2012-08-10T07:24:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	AceLaptop	did you try crtl d?
2012-08-10T07:25:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	AceLaptop	did you close the terminal since the last error?
2012-08-10T07:26:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	AceLaptop	ah you have to carefully follow what I write no biggie, so reboot to the disc again, follow my script and sub that one line from the wiki, and try again following my script otherwise.
2012-08-10T07:28:00.000Z	AceLaptop	wilee-nilee	would it be a good idea to just pull the drive out?
2012-08-10T07:30:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	AceLaptop	that wont matter really, whwn you redoing the process look at the wiki and just copy and paste the commands form there put the sda1 in where the nount is put the sda where it is just refrence the script to find the correct commands they are in one after another in the script, this will make sure there is no incorrect rendering in the script.Jusat go slow and take your time.
2012-08-10T07:32:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	AceLaptop	put the purge and reinstal in where it is in refrence to the script while copying and pasting from the wiki, does this make sense?
2012-08-10T07:33:00.000Z	AceLaptop	wilee-nilee	only sorta... :P
2012-08-10T07:34:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	AceLaptop	sorta does not work, lets just go pm I will give you each command for you to copy and paste.
2012-08-10T07:35:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	AceLaptop	cool I'm just concerned that any other line didi not render correctly is all.
