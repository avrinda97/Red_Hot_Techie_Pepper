2005-01-21T10:20:00.000Z	mkerby		Thanks, sensebend.
2005-01-21T10:21:00.000Z	mkerby		I'm trying to install warty.
2005-01-21T10:21:00.000Z	mkerby		Everything is fine until I get to "Installing the base system"
2005-01-21T10:22:00.000Z	mkerby		It moves right along until it gets to 85 percent.  Then it stays there for a looooong time.
2005-01-21T10:22:00.000Z	sensebend	mkerby	could it be a problem with the media
2005-01-21T10:22:00.000Z	sensebend		most installer errors generally come back to a problem in burning
2005-01-21T10:22:00.000Z	mkerby		Then it says "No installable kernal was found in the defined APT packages".
2005-01-21T10:23:00.000Z	mkerby		Okay.  So it might work if I burn it again?
2005-01-21T10:23:00.000Z	sensebend	mkerby	perhaps
2005-01-21T10:23:00.000Z	sensebend		I'd check your media with a md5 checksum
2005-01-21T10:24:00.000Z	mkerby		I'll do it.
2005-01-21T10:24:00.000Z	mkerby		Thanks!
2005-01-21T10:24:00.000Z	sensebend		if you know how to do that
2005-01-21T10:24:00.000Z	mkerby		I'll let you know how it goes.
2005-01-21T10:24:00.000Z	sensebend		that would be the first thing to check though
2005-01-21T10:24:00.000Z	mkerby		I think I do but tell me anyway :)
2005-01-21T10:24:00.000Z	sensebend	mkerby	what OS would you be verifying from?
2005-01-21T10:25:00.000Z	mkerby		I'm on the other machine which has Windows XP
2005-01-21T10:26:00.000Z	sensebend	mkerby	run this on the iso image http://winmd5sum.solidblue.biz/
2005-01-21T10:26:00.000Z	sensebend		and check to see that it matches that of the file on the site
2005-01-21T10:33:00.000Z	mkerby	sensebend	I just did the md5 checksum.  It's fine.
