2009-08-21T17:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cristi1	will do, they are called window decorators btw
2009-08-21T17:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cristi1	let me find a guide, you need some lines in xorg.conf

2009-08-21T17:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cristi1	yep
2009-08-21T17:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cristi1	you can also run ccsm and Go to the Advanced Desktop Effects and Settings and enable the Window Decoration feature.
2009-08-21T17:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cristi1	i think its ghastly
2009-08-21T17:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cristi1	256mb is fine
2009-08-21T17:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cristi1	if you want a more responsive system use xubuntu or install lxde on the system
2009-08-21T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cristi1	its a lame use of the /me irc command, it actually does nothing but display text
2009-08-21T17:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cristi1	if they are very portable then yes, they will most likely need installing under cedega
2009-08-21T17:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cristi1	some games may, if you contact the support number you have then they will be able to give the support you have paid for
2009-08-21T17:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cristi1	some do, some don't
2009-08-21T17:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cristi1	some even have linux installers to run natively (like doom3)
2009-08-21T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cristi1	if you install gaming apps like wine etc it will be a gaming ubuntu. te only difference between the *unntus is the default app list
2009-08-21T18:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cristi1	just makeslife easier
2009-08-21T18:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cristi1	linux is hugely case sensitive
