2008-05-19T06:28:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
2008-05-19T06:29:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	you don't need to do that
2008-05-19T06:29:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	that is all in the kernel
2008-05-19T06:30:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	that is the operating system, the kernel is the program that controls everything
2008-05-19T06:30:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	basically, if you're running ubuntu you probably have every driver ("kernel module") already available
2008-05-19T06:41:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	have you gotten someone to help you?
2008-05-19T06:43:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	pm me

2008-05-19T06:49:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	with wine, or?
2008-05-19T06:51:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	run glxinfo from an xterm
2008-05-19T06:52:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	you're in gnome?
2008-05-19T06:52:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	and by run i mean just type glxinfo and hit enter
2008-05-19T06:53:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	and did it spit out a ton of stuff in the terminal?
2008-05-19T06:56:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	go up to the top of the output
2008-05-19T07:11:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	sorry, lost connection to the server for a bit there
2008-05-19T07:11:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	if you're 3d driver is working then follow a howto on install cs:s
2008-05-19T07:11:00.000Z	bderrly_	mookinator1313	from what i've seen you basically install wine, run SteamInstaller.exe with it and tell it to install CS
