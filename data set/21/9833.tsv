2006-01-27T17:11:00.000Z	mwe	n00b	yeah I love slack.
2006-01-27T17:07:00.000Z	mwe	n00b	the gentoo installation process is very tedious. not that hard though
2006-01-27T17:07:00.000Z	n00b	mwe	are there instruction for the installatin procedure or do you have to know your linux well?
2006-01-27T17:08:00.000Z	mwe	n00b	there's a step by step guide you should print
2006-01-27T17:08:00.000Z	n00b	mwe	do you think gentoo is more powerful than ubuntu? if so, how much more powerful?
2006-01-27T17:08:00.000Z	mwe	n00b	gentoo is really slow though, because you always compiling stuff
2006-01-27T17:09:00.000Z	n00b	mwe	so whats the point of using gentoo then? which distro do you think would be the fastest?
2006-01-27T17:09:00.000Z	mwe	n00b	well I like ubuntu.
2006-01-27T17:10:00.000Z	mwe	n00b	gentoo is all right. I just hate the fact the I spend so much time compiling everything from source all the time
2006-01-27T17:11:00.000Z	n00b	mwe	ok. have you tried slackware?
2006-01-27T17:11:00.000Z	mwe	n00b	but once it's done it runs really fast. but then the next day a new kde version is out and you have to wait 4 hours for it to compile
2006-01-27T17:12:00.000Z	n00b	mwe	whats that like? difficult? powerful?
2006-01-27T17:18:00.000Z	mwe	n00b	ubuntu is booting considerably faster here
2006-01-27T17:19:00.000Z	n00b	mwe	okay so how fast is it? like 20 seconds? 30? how do i make it faster?
2006-01-27T17:20:00.000Z	mwe	n00b	it takes 20 -30 secs until I get to the gdm login. then 5-10 secs for kde to start
2006-01-27T17:20:00.000Z	mwe	n00b	windows takes maybe 50 secs. then another minute or so before I can acutually use the desktop
2006-01-27T17:21:00.000Z	mwe	n00b	make sure ubuntu boot is not waiting a long time a some point like when it can't connect to the time server
2006-01-27T17:22:00.000Z	n00b	mwe	how do i check that? i know that i connect to the time server
2006-01-27T17:23:00.000Z	mwe	n00b	if it hangs a long time at that point something is not right
2006-01-27T17:23:00.000Z	mwe	n00b	if it only takes 3 seconds before it moves on it's ok
2006-01-27T17:24:00.000Z	n00b	mwe	nah mine takes 3 seconds too
