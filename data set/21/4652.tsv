2008-03-12T23:51:00.000Z	Linux_Freshe1		Q: how to make a folder go to TRASH after hitting DELETE key ? right now i deleted 2 folders using delete key .. they are not there in trash can ..  Q2: also, is there undelete util in ubuntu ?
2008-03-12T23:52:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Linux_Freshe1	Are those files hidden files? e.g. .file
2008-03-12T23:52:00.000Z	Linux_Freshe1	Odd-rationale	 nope .. not hidden .. basically movies i have seen .. i accidentally deleted one that i had not seen ..
2008-03-12T23:54:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Linux_Freshe1	As for your other question, there is no restore feature in ubuntu *yet*. From what I read, hardy may have this feature. As a side note, kubuntu already has the restore feature.
2008-03-13T00:00:00.000Z	Linux_Freshe1	Odd-rationale	 any possibility of changing the nautulus behaviour ? that when i hit delete, files shouldnt disappear totally, they should go to trash can ?
2008-03-13T00:01:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Linux_Freshe1	By default they should go to the trashbin. Double ckeck in Edit -> Prefences.
2008-03-13T00:02:00.000Z	Linux_Freshe1	Odd-rationale	 i havent ever gone in any prefes  ..  but will double check if u say
2008-03-13T00:03:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Linux_Freshe1	Is it files from your / partition or external hdd ?
2008-03-13T00:04:00.000Z	Linux_Freshe1	Odd-rationale	 there is one option under nautulus behaviour which says "include a delete command that bypasses trash"  .. its not checked .
2008-03-13T00:04:00.000Z	Linux_Freshe1	Odd-rationale	 the movie which accidentally got deleted was from NTFS windows partition
2008-03-13T00:05:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Linux_Freshe1	OK. Then the story is completely differnet. If you press delete fram a external fat or ntfs partitoin they are GONE!
2008-03-13T00:06:00.000Z	Linux_Freshe1	Odd-rationale	 okies, its then not a bug, but surely a warning message should pop up saying that the file will be gone and wont be moved to trash
2008-03-13T00:06:00.000Z	Linux_Freshe1	Odd-rationale	 where can i put such suggestion ?
2008-03-13T00:08:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Linux_Freshe1	Files on your local filesystem are stored in your ~/.Trash directory. If you have an external ext3 hdd, then pressing the delete key moves them to that drive's own .Trash folder. ntfs of course is not an officially supprted linux filesytem. I don't know about the other filesystems.
2008-03-13T00:09:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Linux_Freshe1	So my suggestion: use ext3. :)
2008-03-13T00:10:00.000Z	Linux_Freshe1	Odd-rationale	 i am a windows user trying to convert to linux .. i cant let go of windows yet .. so total ext3 is not a possibility atm
2008-03-13T00:10:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Linux_Freshe1	You'll come around... :)
2008-03-13T00:11:00.000Z	Linux_Freshe1	Odd-rationale	 i hope to :)
2008-03-13T00:24:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Linux_Freshe1	maybe that convinces you?
2008-03-13T00:24:00.000Z	Linux_Freshe1	Odd-rationale	 yup  .. i guess thats the case like u said :)
2008-03-13T00:26:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Linux_Freshe1	I held on to my external ntfs hdd for a while. But without the regular maintence tools required for ntfs, it eventually got fragmented beyond repair. So I just reformated to ext3. I'm happy now! :)
