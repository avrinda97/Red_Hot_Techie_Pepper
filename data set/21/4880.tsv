2011-04-25T16:27:00.000Z	g0th		It says: Not allowed to print.
2011-04-25T16:27:00.000Z	g0th		If I am not allowed to print, how do I allow myself?
2011-04-25T16:27:00.000Z	g0th		I should note that I can print stuff I just cannot print a testpage or clean the printer
2011-04-25T16:27:00.000Z	g0th		I dont think it depends Dr-Willis
2011-04-25T16:27:00.000Z	g0th		because it is a cups issue not a printer issue
2011-04-25T16:28:00.000Z	g0th		everything works
2011-04-25T16:28:00.000Z	g0th		but the "interface" doesnt seem to work so nice
2011-04-25T16:28:00.000Z	g0th		the printout is very bad quality
2011-04-25T16:28:00.000Z	g0th		so I wanted to clean the printer using cups
2011-04-25T16:28:00.000Z	g0th		but it always tells me "Not allowed to print"
2011-04-25T16:28:00.000Z	Macer	g0th	some printers are windows specific
2011-04-25T16:28:00.000Z	Macer		cups only allows it to print
2011-04-25T16:29:00.000Z	g0th		this one is definitely not windows specific, also I use it since 2 years
2011-04-25T16:29:00.000Z	g0th		it is not that
2011-04-25T16:29:00.000Z	g0th		it prints the page but kind of "doubled"
2011-04-25T16:29:00.000Z	g0th		Ie. I get the whole picture
2011-04-25T16:29:00.000Z	g0th		and then a much weaker version of it again a bit lower
2011-04-25T16:30:00.000Z	Macer		most printers have a way to do it locally
2011-04-25T16:30:00.000Z	g0th		how to solve it?
2011-04-25T16:30:00.000Z	Macer		by holding a button on the printer
2011-04-25T16:30:00.000Z	g0th	Macer	hmm nice
