2007-06-01T15:33:00.000Z	Fawaz	stefg	on scici partition
2007-06-01T15:34:00.000Z	Fawaz	stefg	would that be a problem?
2007-06-01T15:34:00.000Z	stefg	Fawaz	it might be that grub can't see that partition.Do you have 2machines (you can be on IRC have grub on the other)?
2007-06-01T15:35:00.000Z	Fawaz		stegg: this machine is my laptop .. i have a problem with my server the machine infront of me
2007-06-01T15:35:00.000Z	Fawaz	stefg	how can i make GRUB see the partition?
2007-06-01T15:36:00.000Z	stefg	Fawaz	you can't make, you can only test if grub sees it. if not you'll have to have a boot partition on a drive that grub can see
2007-06-01T15:37:00.000Z	Fawaz	stefg	i had red hat installed previously on the same partition.. does red hat uses grub?
2007-06-01T15:37:00.000Z	Fawaz	stefg	how can i test
2007-06-01T15:37:00.000Z	stefg	Fawaz	don#t use it, but it's pretty likey
2007-06-01T15:37:00.000Z	stefg		Fawaz:I  don't use it, but it's pretty likely
2007-06-01T15:38:00.000Z	Fawaz	stefg	how can i test my grub if it sees it or not?
2007-06-01T15:39:00.000Z	stefg	Fawaz	get a grub-command line at boot and issue 'find /boot/grub/stage1'
2007-06-01T15:40:00.000Z	Fawaz	stefg	how can i get to the command line.. the PC kinda not resposes after showing the word GRUB.. is there key i press while booting to get to command line?
2007-06-01T15:41:00.000Z	stefg	Fawaz	ok, grub isn't installed properly.... so the machine is obviously unbootable. not much you can do, except booting a live-cd and try to fix grub from there
2007-06-01T15:43:00.000Z	Fawaz	stefg	any suggestions on how to fix it or where to look ?
2007-06-01T15:43:00.000Z	stefg		!grub | Fawaz
