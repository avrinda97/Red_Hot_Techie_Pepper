2012-08-04T21:53:00.000Z	zachP		My server machine has internet connection yet all software sources are down??? Can't seem to update or install anything :(
2012-08-04T21:55:00.000Z	NewWorld	zachP	 What's the error msg?
2012-08-04T23:11:00.000Z	NewWorld	zachP	 Can you write to the disk at all? `touch /tmp/aoeu`
2012-08-04T23:12:00.000Z	zachP	NewWorld	no it says read only...actually, let me reboot I seem to remember a problem with mounting on start-up (I am running encrypted LVM)
2012-08-04T23:19:00.000Z	zachP	NewWorld	I think I found the problem, you made me stop and think. I edited a file having to do with the partitions in the tutorial. I am in manual recovery, I'm going to try and undo what I did earlier.
2012-08-04T23:38:00.000Z	NewWorld	zachP	 So you do `sudo reboot` and it says those things and just hangs?
2012-08-04T23:38:00.000Z	zachP	NewWorld	Yes
2012-08-04T23:39:00.000Z	NewWorld	zachP	 Btw don't hard-reset. If you have to, use Magic SysRq  key shortcuts. It shuts machine down softer
2012-08-04T23:39:00.000Z	zachP	NewWorld	Okay, thanks. Do you have a link to those? If not I will search.
2012-08-04T23:40:00.000Z	NewWorld	zachP	 And since you said the root partition is mounted read-only, I don't think it's a big deal to reboot that way. And they're on google))
2012-08-04T23:41:00.000Z	zachP	NewWorld	Okay, good. Yeah I found out what I did, I didn't add my line correctly in /etc/fstab and I just need to change it, but I am working on that since everything is read-only
2012-08-04T23:50:00.000Z	zachP	NewWorld	Thanks for that. I wish they had that back in windows98 :D
2012-08-04T23:51:00.000Z	NewWorld	zachP	 np)) had what in w98? :)
2012-08-04T23:55:00.000Z	zachP	NewWorld	One little problem I am confident you can solve :) I need to edit /etc/fstab but it doesn't seem to let me because it is read-only...But everything is read-only because of an error while mounting...because of the file error (thanks to me). Any ideas?
2012-08-04T23:55:00.000Z	NewWorld	zachP	 I remember with `mount` you can give it something like "-o remount,rw" to remount it as read-writable. it's in the manual
2012-08-05T00:06:00.000Z	zachP	NewWorld	Okay, almost there, when I try to remount, it mentions an "unrecognized mount option" which is part of the line I entered incorrectly in /etc/fstab. It mentions "jqfmt=vfsv" which is supposed to be "jqfmt=vfs0". Any way to call it with the 0 from command line?
2012-08-05T00:08:00.000Z	NewWorld	zachP	 What even is "jqfmt=vfsv" is? what does it mean?
2012-08-05T00:14:00.000Z	zachP	NewWorld	Here is a pastebin for you: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1129512/
2012-08-05T00:18:00.000Z	zachP	NewWorld	Here is what I was talking about in a pastebin, but I must go now, thanks for the help PM if you have any ideas based on it, thanks very much: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1129512/
2012-08-05T00:19:00.000Z	NewWorld	zachP	 I'll look at it and PM if I know, see you))
2012-08-05T00:19:00.000Z	zachP	NewWorld	Thanks a million!
