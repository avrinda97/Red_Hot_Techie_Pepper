2010-04-30T11:26:00.000Z	__dantheman		and if nothing shows up tye lsmod | grep fglrx
2010-04-30T11:26:00.000Z	aqeel		ATI Technologies Inc M22 [Mobility Radeon X300]
2010-04-30T11:26:00.000Z	__dantheman		i dont think that fglrx supports that
2010-04-30T11:27:00.000Z	aqeel		:( everything was working fine in ubuntu 9.10
2010-04-30T11:28:00.000Z	aqeel		i have upgraded it today
2010-04-30T11:28:00.000Z	aqeel		just few hours ago
2010-04-30T11:28:00.000Z	__dantheman	aqeel	type lsmod | grep fglrx
2010-04-30T11:28:00.000Z	__dantheman		to see if your running fglrx
2010-04-30T11:29:00.000Z	aqeel	sunk8	nothing shows up on that
2010-04-30T11:30:00.000Z	__dantheman	aqeel	I'm pretty sure that fglrx doesn't support the x300
