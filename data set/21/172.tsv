2012-07-04T11:56:00.000Z	Guest53401		Hello. I am using a fresh install of 12.04, trying to log into my ubuntu one, being asked for the keyring password. My user login password does not satisfy it. What can it be? Is there any default keyring password?
2012-07-04T11:57:00.000Z	massdivide	Guest53401	could you submit a screenshot of the window?
2012-07-04T11:57:00.000Z	Guest53401	massdivide	sure. to which website?
2012-07-04T11:58:00.000Z	massdivide	Guest53401	tinypic is fine with me
2012-07-04T11:59:00.000Z	Guest53401	massdivide	when being asked for the keyring password, I cannot do anything else - neither writing here, nor taking a screenshot. But I can copy it to my notebook and write it here...
2012-07-04T12:04:00.000Z	Guest53401	massdivide	this is the view a moment before the request for keyring password: http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=9to8sp&s=6
2012-07-04T12:05:00.000Z	Guest53401	massdivide	look at "The user cancelled a prompt". this what happens after I cancel after a few unsuccesful password enter tries.
2012-07-04T12:05:00.000Z	massdivide	Guest53401	it wants your ubuntu one password not your localhost password. Try the "I forgot my password" button.
2012-07-04T12:05:00.000Z	Guest53401	massdivide	I know that. I know my ubuntu one password as well. What I was saying is that after I click "sign in" it asks for my keyring password, and does not accept my regular ubuntu login password.
2012-07-04T12:06:00.000Z	massdivide	Guest53401	its trying to store the password or recall it from the keyring. What version of ubuntu?
2012-07-04T12:06:00.000Z	Guest53401	massdivide	12.04
2012-07-04T12:07:00.000Z	massdivide	Guest53401	sys up to date?
2012-07-04T12:07:00.000Z	Guest53401	massdivide	I've been updated about 35 minutes ago.
2012-07-04T12:08:00.000Z	massdivide	Guest53401	and you rebooted correct?
2012-07-04T12:08:00.000Z	Guest53401	massdivide	yes. It is a fresh install, I have rebooted once since the problem occured.
2012-07-04T12:09:00.000Z	massdivide	Guest53401	have you set a root password?
2012-07-04T12:10:00.000Z	Guest53401	massdivide	I have not installed it, a computer guy has done that. He says he has not set any password but my login password, but I suspect he might be wrong. He's not here to help any more.
2012-07-04T12:10:00.000Z	massdivide	Guest53401	sudo passwd root
2012-07-04T12:11:00.000Z	Guest53401	massdivide	thanks, I have updated it. I'll try again with the keyring - or should I reboot first?
2012-07-04T12:12:00.000Z	Guest53401	massdivide	ok, I do have a root password now, but it is not the keyring password.
2012-07-04T12:18:00.000Z	Guest53401	massdivide	I'd do that as well, if I'd known how
