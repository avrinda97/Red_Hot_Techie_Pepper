2008-10-31T14:18:00.000Z	jynxzero_		Hi... has anyone done un upgrade from Heron -> Ibex, on a box with LILO+LVM ?
2008-10-31T14:18:00.000Z	jynxzero_		I'm a bit scared because past kernel upgrades have left my box unbootable.
2008-10-31T14:19:00.000Z	jynxzero_		And I can't use GRUB due to a BIOS bug
2008-10-31T14:19:00.000Z	_2	jynxzero_	lilo ?
2008-10-31T14:21:00.000Z	_2	jynxzero_	i have to use lilo here, grub can't boot without a partition.  liloworks fine.
2008-10-31T14:21:00.000Z	jynxzero_	_2	Did you upgrade from Heron to Ibex?  It's just that, I suspect this combo is not well tested.
2008-10-31T14:22:00.000Z	_2	jynxzero_	no i didn't upgrade.  but lilo should work reguardless of version
2008-10-31T14:22:00.000Z	_2	jynxzero_	you can   sudo lilo   to test the configurateion.
2008-10-31T14:23:00.000Z	jynxzero_	_2	Last time I did a kernel upgrade, that claimed to work but left my box totally f*cked.
2008-10-31T14:24:00.000Z	_2	jynxzero_	one question, did it load the kernel and dump you into a busybox shell?   or did it just say Li LI LI Li Li Li .....
2008-10-31T14:26:00.000Z	_2	jynxzero_	if busybox shell, then that's not a lilo problem. it would have done the same with grub, it's a misconfigured initramfs.img    if no kernel loaded. then it's a lilo problem.
2008-10-31T14:26:00.000Z	jynxzero_	_2	It was definitely before the kernel loaded, can't remember if it was the infinite LILILIs.
2008-10-31T14:27:00.000Z	jynxzero_	_2	That particular problem was due to the kernel size.
2008-10-31T14:27:00.000Z	jynxzero_	_2	I don't think the same thing will happen again, but my point is... it does screw up without warning sometimes.
2008-10-31T14:27:00.000Z	jynxzero_	_2	So I'd feel a lot more comfortable if someone said "Yes, I did this upgrade, it worked."
2008-10-31T14:27:00.000Z	_2	jynxzero_	no.  that's still not a lilo problem.  the boot loader is not to blame for that.
2008-10-31T14:28:00.000Z	jynxzero_	_2	I'm not concerned who's fault it is.
2008-10-31T14:28:00.000Z	jynxzero_	_2	The effect is the same
2008-10-31T14:31:00.000Z	_2	jynxzero_	the kernel packages warn you, that you have to manually run lilo     it's not an issue.  it's pebcak.
2008-10-31T14:31:00.000Z	jynxzero_	_2	It wasn't failure to run LILO.
2008-10-31T14:32:00.000Z	_2	jynxzero_	i've been using lilo for about 9 years now. and on about 12 boxen.    lilo works!     and i'll say no more.
