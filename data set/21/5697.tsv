2007-09-10T16:02:00.000Z	Evanlec	Slart	you're running oblivion on wine?
2007-09-10T16:02:00.000Z	Slart	Evanlec	yes?
2007-09-10T16:03:00.000Z	Slart	Evanlec	it runs like a 80-year old life long smoker but it runs =)
2007-09-11T16:04:00.000Z	Slart	Evanlec	well.. on the serious side.. it runs ok.. I get about 10 fps in some really bad spots (the arena for example) but up to 60 fps in dungeons.. medium bling bling, medium textures
2007-09-11T16:05:00.000Z	Slart	Evanlec	that's running it on my AMD 64x2 6000+ with 2GB and a 8800 GTX
2007-09-11T16:06:00.000Z	Evanlec	Slart	oh my, i just got a 8800 gts, was playin with it in windows earlier
2007-09-11T16:06:00.000Z	Evanlec	Slart	did u try running it in windows?
2007-09-11T16:07:00.000Z	Slart	Evanlec	I got roughly the same numbers playing it on a 7900 gtx with a slightly slower processor too.. I think there's something ugly in the shader-department.. something just doesn't translate right to opengl shaders or something.. I don't think it's gpu bound
2007-09-11T16:08:00.000Z	Evanlec	Slart	yea i guess im not all that suprised
2007-09-11T16:08:00.000Z	Slart	Evanlec	nope.. haven't booted into windows for a looong time.. but I'm guessing I get about half the performance or worse compared to the linux-wine version
2007-09-11T16:08:00.000Z	Evanlec	Slart	what do u mean compared to the linux-wine version?
2007-09-11T16:09:00.000Z	Slart	Evanlec	windows version would perhaps give me double the performance compared to running it using linux/wine
2007-09-11T14:35:00.000Z	Slart	Evanlec	what is a .daa image? you can mount an iso by doing "sudo mount -o loop /path/to/your/iso.iso /your/mountpoint"
2007-09-11T14:36:00.000Z	Evanlec	Slart	kk nevermind i foudn it, .daa is a disc image format used by PowerISO software, but they have a free linux version at http://www.poweriso.com/download.htm
2007-09-11T14:36:00.000Z	Slart	Evanlec	ah.. I tried searching in synaptic for some kind of converter but I didn't find anything
2007-09-11T14:38:00.000Z	Slart	Evanlec	nah... try /opt/programname instead
2007-09-11T14:38:00.000Z	Slart	Evanlec	usually you install the program somewhere and make a link in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin or any of those
2007-10-29T11:58:00.000Z	Slart	Evanlec	doesn't work here.. get a file not found error
2007-10-29T11:58:00.000Z	Evanlec	Slart	yea, from HP
2007-10-29T11:58:00.000Z	Evanlec	Slart	what a crock of shit
2007-10-29T11:58:00.000Z	Slart	Evanlec	or rather "The file you are attempting to download is not available at this time. Please try again..."
