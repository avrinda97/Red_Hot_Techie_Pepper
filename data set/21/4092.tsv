2008-10-14T13:33:00.000Z	WIGGMPk		I have a question about kernel options... I need to add "iommu=soft" so that I am able to use suspend/hibernate without trashing my root partition.. Now does it need to be added to the kernel line or can I just add it to the defoptions line?
2008-10-14T13:35:00.000Z	ziroday	WIGGMPk	I believe that it would be best if you add it to each kernel line automatically
2008-10-14T13:35:00.000Z	ziroday	WIGGMPk	I mean, add it yourself
2008-10-14T13:36:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	ziroday	what exactly is the # defoptions line for then?
2008-10-14T13:37:00.000Z	ziroday	WIGGMPk	defoptions only adds those lines to the default kernel, not all the other ones
2008-10-14T13:38:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	ziroday	what is the default kernel? i only allow 1 kernel in grub.. so should i be good?
2008-10-14T13:39:00.000Z	ziroday	WIGGMPk	the default kernel is the kernel automatically selected in grub. If you are only going to ever boot from that kernel then go ahead
2008-10-14T13:39:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	ziroday	so options like vga=792 and noapic irqpoll can all be added to defoptions? right?
2008-10-14T13:40:00.000Z	ziroday	WIGGMPk	correct
2008-10-14T13:40:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	ziroday	thanks for the info.. didnt wanna take the chance of testing it by trashing my root directory again
2008-10-14T13:40:00.000Z	ziroday	WIGGMPk	no problem, have fun
2008-11-08T13:05:00.000Z	ziroday	WIGGMPk	there is a package called soundconverter, should do what you need
2008-11-09T08:43:00.000Z	ziroday	WIGGMPk	the default gnome screenshot app takes .png files
2008-11-09T08:43:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	ziroday	i know that, but what is .png file associate with?
2008-11-09T08:43:00.000Z	ziroday	WIGGMPk	eye of gnome (eog)
2008-11-09T08:43:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	ziroday	what command opens up the image previewer or whatever the default app is
2008-11-09T08:44:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	ziroday	thanks, you wouldnt happen to know how my file associates got screwed and how to fix them?
2008-11-09T08:44:00.000Z	ziroday	WIGGMPk	nope
