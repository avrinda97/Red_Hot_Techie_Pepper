2008-03-18T23:33:00.000Z	St0n3-C0l	soundray	I've to disable my visual consoles. Where can i comment out ?
2008-03-18T23:34:00.000Z	soundray	St0n3-C0l	I have to dig for that, give me a minute
2008-03-18T23:37:00.000Z	soundray	St0n3-C0l	/etc/default/console-setup -- look for the ACTIVE_CONSOLES variable
2008-03-18T23:38:00.000Z	St0n3-C0l	soundray	thanks man :)
2008-03-18T23:38:00.000Z	soundray	St0n3-C0l	no problem
2008-03-18T23:40:00.000Z	St0n3-C0l	soundray	It says ACTIVE_CONSOLES="/dev/tty[1-6]" | I should limit it to [4-6] ?
2008-03-18T23:41:00.000Z	soundray	St0n3-C0l	worth a try by the looks of it -- I haven't played with that myself
2008-03-18T23:41:00.000Z	St0n3-C0l	soundray	Ehe, I am reading on linuxjournal.com It speeds up system. X11 starts on Screen 7 right?
2008-03-18T23:42:00.000Z	St0n3-C0l	soundray	played and done ;)
2008-03-18T23:42:00.000Z	soundray	St0n3-C0l	it starts on vc 7 or 9 -- what's the date of that article? Old?
2008-03-18T23:43:00.000Z	St0n3-C0l	soundray	Not that old though, it's on ubuntu. You need the link ?
2008-03-18T23:43:00.000Z	soundray	St0n3-C0l	yes, if it's not too much trouble

2008-03-18T23:46:00.000Z	soundray	St0n3-C0l	thanks for that. I doubt that disabling the consoles has a noticeable effect, especially when you're not logged in.
2008-03-18T23:47:00.000Z	St0n3-C0l	soundray	It covers all but this person who wrote this article is a good linux consultant. He says, they still are open to be accessed, if we go on ALT+CTRL+F4 we'll get the screen open.
2008-03-18T23:48:00.000Z	St0n3-C0l	soundray	He's the co-author of book Exploring the JDS Linux Desktop and Linux system administration by O`Reilly. I have one reason to trust him and give it a try ;) :P
