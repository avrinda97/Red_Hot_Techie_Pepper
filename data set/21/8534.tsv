2006-03-19T16:49:00.000Z	Poromenos		what is the number of the second screen? 1:0:1?
2006-03-19T16:51:00.000Z	Poromenos		can i restart X without stopping my apt-getting?
2006-03-19T16:52:00.000Z	Whatsisname	Poromenos	yes
2006-03-19T16:52:00.000Z	Whatsisname		just fork the apt-get process
2006-03-19T16:52:00.000Z	Whatsisname		although if it requires your intervention you're screwed
2006-03-19T16:52:00.000Z	Whatsisname		unless you use it in screen or something
2006-03-19T16:52:00.000Z	Poromenos	Whatsisname	hmm, yeah
2006-03-19T16:52:00.000Z	Poromenos		well, i'll wait
2006-03-19T16:52:00.000Z	Poromenos		by the way, can i get dpkg-reconfigure to autodetect the OTHER screen settings? what number is the second screen?
2006-03-19T16:53:00.000Z	Whatsisname		i don't think so
2006-03-19T16:53:00.000Z	Poromenos		it's asking me for a bus and it has PCI:1:0:0
2006-03-19T16:53:00.000Z	Whatsisname		for what
2006-03-19T16:53:00.000Z	Whatsisname		whats asking you for a bus
2006-03-19T16:54:00.000Z	Whatsisname		is it asking you to specify a video card or something
2006-03-19T16:55:00.000Z	Poromenos		to autodetect my screen, i think
2006-03-19T16:55:00.000Z	Whatsisname		well
2006-03-19T16:55:00.000Z	Whatsisname		in a terminal run
2006-03-19T16:55:00.000Z	Poromenos		but yeah, it doesn't make much sense that the screen would be in the PCI bus
2006-03-19T16:55:00.000Z	Whatsisname		lspci -X
2006-03-19T16:55:00.000Z	Whatsisname		and it will spit out PCI devices with identifiers useful for X configurations
2006-03-19T16:56:00.000Z	Poromenos	Whatsisname	yeah, the vidcard is there
