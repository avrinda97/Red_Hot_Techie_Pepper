2006-01-13T09:08:00.000Z	Jared		Does anyone know what repository that the spca5xx webcam driver is on. i just did a fresh install and i can't find it
2006-01-13T09:09:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	its best to use the source from the website. spca5xx locks up my system hard.
2006-01-13T09:11:00.000Z	Jared	Toma-	could you tell me which repository it is in??
2006-01-13T09:11:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	...
2006-01-13T09:11:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	the drivers come with the kernel
2006-01-13T09:12:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	yep
2006-01-13T09:13:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	'sudo modprobe spca5xx' should load it up fine
2006-01-13T09:14:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	the driver is french? ?;/
2006-01-13T09:17:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	"modprobe"
2006-01-13T09:20:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	run "sudo modprobe spca5xx"
2006-01-13T09:20:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	that means its loaded
2006-01-13T09:21:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	run "v4l-conf" and some info should popup on what your webcam is
2006-01-13T09:22:00.000Z	Jared	Toma-	camorama froze up when i tried to use it
2006-01-13T09:23:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	thats because the spca5xx drivers in ubuntu are BROKEN!
2006-01-13T09:24:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	follow this howto, and it'll work perfect. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75284
2006-01-13T09:24:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	however, use the updated drivers from the website
2006-01-13T09:25:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	yep. (also, looks like the howto has the updated driver on it anyway)
2006-01-13T09:26:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca5xx.html
2006-01-13T09:27:00.000Z	Toma-	Jared	i had the same problem. updating the driver makes it all great. also, the newer driver makes MSN webcam chat on amsn run awesome :D
