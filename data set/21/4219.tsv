2008-12-06T20:26:00.000Z	ExElNeT		since intrepid my system wont boot anymore... is the new kernel missing the 3ware 8000er raid driver?
2008-12-06T20:26:00.000Z	Yahovah	ExElNeT	No
2008-12-06T20:27:00.000Z	ExElNeT	Yahovah	so i wonder why im getting a kernel panic...
2008-12-06T21:06:00.000Z	ExElNeT	Yahovah	even an old kernel wont work anymore... i wonder what could be wrong... cannot open root device... would it be possible that the device name /dev/sda3 changed?
2008-12-06T21:06:00.000Z	Yahovah	ExElNeT	Yes
2008-12-06T21:07:00.000Z	Yahovah	ExElNeT	Check dmesg to see if it changed.
2008-12-06T21:07:00.000Z	Yahovah	ExElNeT	Assuming you can boot.
2008-12-06T21:07:00.000Z	ExElNeT	Yahovah	yeah i cant...
2008-12-06T21:07:00.000Z	Yahovah	ExElNeT	Do you have multiple scsi/sata/usb drive devices in that machine?
2008-12-06T21:09:00.000Z	ExElNeT	Yahovah	only the 3ware 8006 raidcontroller...
2008-12-06T21:09:00.000Z	Yahovah	ExElNeT	It didn't change then. Maybe something went wrong with your controller.
2008-12-06T21:10:00.000Z	ExElNeT	Yahovah	the controller is working fine... i can access the ext3 partitions from windows
2008-12-06T21:11:00.000Z	ExElNeT	Yahovah	i just copied over some old kernel files i found... i wont trust them that much.. :=) so it might be still the new kerne√∂
2008-12-06T21:11:00.000Z	Yahovah	ExElNeT	Oh, boot from a livecd distribution and compile/install a new kernel (from source), then.
2008-12-06T21:11:00.000Z	ExElNeT	Yahovah	yeah im downloading a livecd
2008-12-06T21:12:00.000Z	Yahovah	ExElNeT	Download a 2.26.x kernel from kernel.org
2008-12-06T21:12:00.000Z	Yahovah	ExElNeT	Err, 2.6.x
2008-12-06T21:14:00.000Z	ExElNeT	Yahovah	yeah i ll download a 64bit server unbuntu first... i think server might be better since im sure that my controller will be supported
2008-12-06T21:14:00.000Z	Yahovah	ExElNeT	It's really almost an identical kernel to the desktop.
2008-12-06T21:44:00.000Z	ExElNeT	Yahovah	well what should i say... NEVER trust an installer... the installer didnt add the initrd to the menu.lst... what a stupid error... and i didnt see it up to now...
2008-12-06T21:45:00.000Z	ExElNeT	Yahovah	thanks for your help
