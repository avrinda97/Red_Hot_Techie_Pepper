2010-03-16T13:34:00.000Z	sixofour		When ever I play a game on my widescreen laptop in ubuntu, the bottom 10% of the screen is cutoff when I enter fullscreen mode. Applications seem to think I have a standard monitor, and not a widescreen, so they are rendering in standard mode. How do I fix this?
2010-03-16T13:34:00.000Z	sixofour		lol..

2010-03-16T13:35:00.000Z	theadmin	sixofour	Ubuntu Software Center, new feature of Karmic. Before, it was called "Add/Remove"
2010-03-16T13:50:00.000Z	theadmin	sixofour	Say, does this happen on other distros? Just in case, did you test? I don't think it's an Ubuntu prob
2010-03-16T13:51:00.000Z	sixofour	theadmin	 wine runs games normally
2010-03-16T13:51:00.000Z	theadmin	sixofour	Some, yeah %) I always have fullscreen problems because gnome-panel is all like "Hey, no, i must be on top!"
2010-03-16T13:53:00.000Z	theadmin	sixofour	Hm. I'd stay. I'm one of dual-booters ;)
2010-03-16T13:53:00.000Z	theadmin	sixofour	ReactOS did that... Kinda a open-source Windows implemintation, a really weirdish idea
2010-03-16T14:07:00.000Z	theadmin	sixofour	Ah, compiz! You forgot to mention that, it always craps wine up
2010-03-16T14:07:00.000Z	theadmin	sixofour	System - Preferences - Appearance - Desktop Effects - None for a permanent result
2010-03-16T14:08:00.000Z	theadmin	sixofour	Actually, it's not Ubuntu, it's GNOME. Because compiz is a gnome thing
2010-03-16T14:09:00.000Z	sixofour	theadmin	 compiz is not a gnome thing
2010-03-16T14:09:00.000Z	theadmin	sixofour	It's developed for GNOME, i'd say
