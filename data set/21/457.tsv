2011-12-05T00:58:00.000Z	Jigal	mactrent	updating db now
2011-12-05T00:53:00.000Z	mactrent	Jigal	Try ubdatedb as root, then look again.
2011-12-05T00:55:00.000Z	mactrent	Jigal	Or you could press <alt>F2, type netbeans, then pin it to Unity.
2011-12-05T01:06:00.000Z	Jigal	mactrent	updatedb didn't work
2011-12-05T01:06:00.000Z	mactrent	Jigal	As in, it still didn't find it?
2011-12-05T01:07:00.000Z	mactrent	Jigal	Ok, open up the terminal and type 'which netbeans', the tell me what shows up.
2011-12-05T01:08:00.000Z	Jigal	mactrent	nothing
2011-12-05T01:09:00.000Z	mactrent	Jigal	That's not good.  Try this: 'll /usr/bin|grep netbeans', where the thing between 'bin' and 'grep' is not a letter L.
2011-12-05T01:10:00.000Z	Jigal	mactrent	same result : nothing
2011-12-05T01:10:00.000Z	Jigal	mactrent	but i did install it
2011-12-05T01:11:00.000Z	Jigal	mactrent	it's on a virtualbox machine
2011-12-05T01:12:00.000Z	mactrent	Jigal	I'd install it on my system to troubleshoot, but I'm running out of space on this partition.  The fact that it's a virtual machine shouldn't have anything to do with it.
2011-12-05T01:12:00.000Z	Jigal	mactrent	ok. how can i find the executable to run?
2011-12-05T01:14:00.000Z	mactrent	Jigal	'find / 2> /dev/null|grep netbeans' should show everything containing 'netbeans'.  I'm afraid that's all I have.
2011-12-05T01:15:00.000Z	Jigal	mactrent	what's the extension of the executable
2011-12-05T01:15:00.000Z	mactrent	Jigal	Since Unix doesn't need extensions, there usually isn't one.
2011-12-05T01:16:00.000Z	mactrent	Jigal	And I highly doubt netbeans would want one.
2011-12-05T01:41:00.000Z	Jigal	mactrent	I have installed it again
2011-12-05T01:42:00.000Z	mactrent	Jigal	And how's it work now?
2011-12-05T01:42:00.000Z	Jigal	mactrent	it still does not appear in the menu
2011-12-05T01:43:00.000Z	mactrent	Jigal	At this point I'd say yes, though I don't know that it'd do anything.  Any more input from the rest of the channel?
