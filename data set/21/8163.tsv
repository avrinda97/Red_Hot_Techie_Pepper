2006-07-10T06:58:00.000Z	SonicChao	giant	depends on what you mean by 'better' :D
2006-07-10T06:58:00.000Z	giant		:) thought so
2006-07-10T06:58:00.000Z	SonicChao	giant	go for Kubuntu :)
2006-07-10T06:58:00.000Z	giant		lol
2006-07-10T06:58:00.000Z	SonicChao	giant	if you're new, it uses KDE, which is good for beginners, I think
2006-07-10T06:58:00.000Z	SonicChao	giant	Or download Ubuntu, and do this:
2006-07-10T06:58:00.000Z	giant		have already installed ubuntu
2006-07-10T06:58:00.000Z	SonicChao		sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2006-07-10T06:59:00.000Z	SonicChao	giant	That way, you can have both. :D
2006-07-10T06:59:00.000Z	giant		how to toggle between them?
2006-07-10T06:59:00.000Z	SonicChao	giant	From "Options"..."Select Session...", "KDE"
2006-07-10T06:59:00.000Z	SonicChao	giant	And click ok, then log in
