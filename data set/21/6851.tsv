2007-01-31T15:52:00.000Z	NetCruZa		I have a 1.4 GB movie file, that i need to move. But i only have a 1 GB USB stick. So i split the files using the 'split' command, but how do i put them back together again?
2007-01-31T15:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	NetCruZa	cat part1 part2 > completfile
2007-01-31T15:53:00.000Z	NetCruZa	thoreauputic	and that will work even when it is not a text file?
2007-01-31T15:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	NetCruZa	try it :)
2007-01-31T15:54:00.000Z	NetCruZa	thoreauputic	Okay ;b
2007-01-31T15:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	NetCruZa	should work as long as you get the order right ;-)
2007-01-31T15:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	NetCruZa	ah - should be cat part1 part2 >> completefile
2007-01-31T15:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	NetCruZa	two >> or it will clobber part1 with part2
2007-01-31T15:56:00.000Z	NetCruZa	thoreauputic	Okay, thanks
2007-01-31T16:05:00.000Z	NetCruZa	thoreauputic	Doesn't seem to work
2007-01-31T16:06:00.000Z	NetCruZa	thoreauputic	It can play the 1st part of the movie, but the it just freezes
2007-01-31T16:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	NetCruZa	hmm
2007-01-31T16:06:00.000Z	NetCruZa	thoreauputic	I am going to download HJSplit now
2007-01-31T16:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	NetCruZa	possibly it lacks some kind of header for part2
2007-01-31T16:06:00.000Z	NetCruZa	thoreauputic	It might work
2007-01-31T16:08:00.000Z	NetCruZa	thoreauputic	Thats what i thought... But when they are put together it shouldn't be a problem?
2007-01-31T16:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	NetCruZa	it *should* work - don't know why it doesn't
2007-01-31T16:09:00.000Z	NetCruZa	thoreauputic	Well.... I wil just have to install HJSplit then :) thx anyway
2007-01-31T16:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	NetCruZa	I've done it with mp3s - but agmittedly there tended ro be a click between parts
2007-01-31T16:09:00.000Z	NetCruZa	thoreauputic	Okay...
2007-01-31T16:16:00.000Z	NetCruZa	thoreauputic	HJSplit installs fine on my laptop, but on the other computer it gives me errors when typing "make"
