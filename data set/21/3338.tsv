2009-07-09T06:04:00.000Z	gartral	oakmac	what kind of sansa?
2009-07-09T06:05:00.000Z	gartral	oakmac	were seeing same issue, ok, one sec, let me figure out where the file is
2009-07-09T06:08:00.000Z	gartral	oakmac	ok in termial put locate 20-libgphoto2.fdi
2009-07-09T06:09:00.000Z	gartral	oakmac	ok, gksu gedit /usr/share/hal/fdi/preprobe/10osvendor/20-libgphoto2.fdi
2009-07-09T06:11:00.000Z	gartral	oakmac	ctl-f and find Sansa E200
2009-07-09T06:11:00.000Z	oakmac	gartral	found it
2009-07-09T06:12:00.000Z	gartral	oakmac	delete the blovk
2009-07-09T06:13:00.000Z	oakmac	gartral	ok
2009-07-09T06:14:00.000Z	gartral	oakmac	ok, now you can save and close the file, and restart your comp (the easy way) or run /ect/init.d/hal restart and replug your sansa
2009-07-09T06:16:00.000Z	oakmac	gartral	i saved the file, restarted hal, and reconnected, still not mounting
2009-07-09T06:16:00.000Z	oakmac	gartral	do i need to restart X for some reason?
2009-07-09T06:16:00.000Z	gartral	oakmac	no, it wasn't hal, sorry...
2009-07-09T06:17:00.000Z	gartral	oakmac	just reboot, i cant remember the command to restart gphoto's detection service right at the moment
2009-07-09T06:17:00.000Z	oakmac	gartral	ok, rebooting
2009-07-09T06:18:00.000Z	gartral	oakmac	it somehow thinks it's part HAL...
2009-07-09T06:30:00.000Z	oakmac	gartral	i removed /usr/share/hal/fdi/preprobe/10osvendor/20-libgphoto2.fdi and it works now
2009-07-09T06:31:00.000Z	oakmac	gartral	thank you for your help :)
2009-07-09T06:31:00.000Z	gartral	oakmac	ok, just dont expect some cameras to work now :)
