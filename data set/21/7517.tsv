2006-09-12T13:30:00.000Z	Iceman241		First Ubuntu release i am ready to remove and replace with windows, completle worthless
2006-09-12T13:31:00.000Z	frying_fish	Iceman241	if you say so, I found it more useful than windows, infact on all 3 of my boxes I have a total of 0 windows installs.
2006-09-12T13:32:00.000Z	frying_fish	Iceman241	you do know its in the repositories right, so you can just get it from nvidia-glx
2006-09-12T13:32:00.000Z	Iceman241	frying_fish	i used hoary, and breezy, but dapper sucks,
2006-09-12T13:32:00.000Z	frying_fish	Iceman241	if you say so, dapper is infinitely better than breezy though for most
2006-09-12T13:33:00.000Z	Iceman241	frying_fish	not after fighting the nvidia driver for 10 hours and getting noplace
2006-09-12T13:33:00.000Z	frying_fish	Iceman241	ok, but I know of most people having got it installed in like 30s
2006-09-12T13:34:00.000Z	Iceman241	frying_fish	fought and fought it, heck breezy and hoary took mere minutes.
2006-09-12T13:35:00.000Z	Iceman241	frying_fish	without the nvidia driver the install is worthless
2006-09-12T13:35:00.000Z	frying_fish	Iceman241	but the nvidia driver isn't broken, its clearly you aren't doing it correctly
2006-09-12T13:36:00.000Z	Iceman241	frying_fish	can't agree, i even gave ssh root access to someone, and they could not get it to work
2006-09-12T13:37:00.000Z	frying_fish	Iceman241	card to new? either that or you probably broke something more funadmental.
2006-09-12T13:37:00.000Z	Iceman241	frying_fish	stupid onboard video, got to install to onboard, then reconfigure the nvidia drivers, then reboot, then reset bios, then reboot again
2006-09-12T13:38:00.000Z	frying_fish	Iceman241	so maybe its not picking up the correct busid's and such
2006-09-12T13:38:00.000Z	frying_fish	Iceman241	then lspci, get the id and such and fix it.
2006-09-12T13:40:00.000Z	Iceman241	frying_fish	that would be what ? 0000:01:09.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV18 [GeForce4 MX 4000 AGP 8x]  (rev c1)
2006-09-12T13:41:00.000Z	frying_fish	Iceman241	PCI:0:1:9
2006-09-12T13:43:00.000Z	Iceman241	frying_fish	check the pm ?
2006-09-12T13:43:00.000Z	frying_fish	Iceman241	if you had actually sent me one sure.
2006-09-12T13:45:00.000Z	Iceman241	frying_fish	your not getting im's
2006-09-12T13:46:00.000Z	frying_fish	Iceman241	not from you.
