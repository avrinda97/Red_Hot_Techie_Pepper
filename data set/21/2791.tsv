2009-06-17T13:58:00.000Z	UbuntuFanBoy	zuluu	Yep
2009-06-17T13:59:00.000Z	UbuntuFanBoy	zuluu	Is someone helping you with your problem? Do you need help?
2009-06-17T13:59:00.000Z	zuluu	UbuntuFanBoy	no, yes
2009-06-17T13:59:00.000Z	zuluu	UbuntuFanBoy	i mean yes, yes
2009-06-17T14:00:00.000Z	zuluu	UbuntuFanBoy	i can ping another ubuntu pc but i cannot see it in network > places
2009-06-17T14:01:00.000Z	UbuntuFanBoy	zuluu	do you have sharing turned on or installed on the other machines? I don't think you will see other Ubuntu machines on the same network by defaukt
2009-06-17T14:02:00.000Z	zuluu	UbuntuFanBoy	JohnQ_ knows that I have another 2 machines
2009-06-17T14:03:00.000Z	zuluu	UbuntuFanBoy	1 is XP and the other is ubuntu. the strange and weird fact is = the windows xp can see me and i can see it.
2009-06-17T14:03:00.000Z	zuluu	UbuntuFanBoy	but the ubuntu client cannot
2009-06-17T14:05:00.000Z	UbuntuFanBoy	zuluu	Are you using iptables rules on the other Ubuntu machine? You said pings do get a reply?
2009-06-17T14:05:00.000Z	zuluu	UbuntuFanBoy	the other ubuntu pc is a fresh install
2009-06-17T14:07:00.000Z	zuluu	UbuntuFanBoy	yes pigns get a reply
2009-06-17T14:08:00.000Z	UbuntuFanBoy	zuluu	This may sound odd but are you using OpenDNS?
2009-06-17T14:08:00.000Z	zuluu	UbuntuFanBoy	no
2009-06-17T14:09:00.000Z	zuluu	UbuntuFanBoy	i think i got it
2009-06-17T14:10:00.000Z	UbuntuFanBoy	zuluu	Try this, goto Places -> Connect To Server and then enter the IP address of the machine you want to connect to (from the machine that sees nothing). Enter the share name as well as the username and password if you're using them.
2009-06-17T14:13:00.000Z	zuluu	UbuntuFanBoy	I will reboot again
2009-06-17T14:14:00.000Z	UbuntuFanBoy	zuluu	did that not work? specifying the share name often works for me when Network Places doesn't
