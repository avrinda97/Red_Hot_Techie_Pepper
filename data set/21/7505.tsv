2009-12-05T19:44:00.000Z	Roasted		hey guys, did anybody update their linux boxes last night and suddenly have no connection? My work laptop (wireless) and desktop (wired) wont get an address now...
2009-12-05T19:45:00.000Z	Dink	Roasted	try running dhclient and see if that reconnects you
2009-12-05T19:45:00.000Z	Roasted		dink - what, is that a command in terminal?
2009-12-05T19:45:00.000Z	Dink	Roasted	yes
2009-12-05T19:46:00.000Z	Roasted		dink - I got a ton of permission denied
2009-12-05T19:46:00.000Z	Roasted		same thing on my laptop too
2009-12-05T19:46:00.000Z	Roasted		WTF did ubuntu do with their updates?
2009-12-05T19:46:00.000Z	Dink	Roasted	I believe you have to run as root/sudo
2009-12-05T19:47:00.000Z	Roasted	bazhang	- excuse me?
2009-12-05T19:47:00.000Z	Roasted	bazhang	- is this a kindergarten hangout here or something?
2009-12-05T19:47:00.000Z	Roasted	bazhang	- I didn't swear. But hey - I appreciate the tip, brosef.
2009-12-05T19:48:00.000Z	Roasted		dink - this is weird bro, my desktop is grabbing an IP of .12 and my laptop is grabbing an IP of .10, but the last octet from my router is always 3 digits.
2009-12-05T19:49:00.000Z	Dink	Roasted	that basically releases/renews your dhcp lease. So whatever your router/switch has free it will give it that address.
2009-12-05T19:49:00.000Z	Roasted		dink - that aint makin sense bro, my router supports up to 50 IPs from what I understand, and these 2 machines arent getting them
2009-12-05T19:50:00.000Z	Roasted		the only thing I can think of is I updated both machines last night
2009-12-05T19:51:00.000Z	Dink	Roasted	Is it just those two machines that can't connect on the route ? Are there other machines on the router that do connect ?
2009-12-05T19:51:00.000Z	Roasted		dink - this has to be a router thing...
2009-12-05T19:51:00.000Z	Roasted		dink - my vista partition is grabbing the .12 IP too...
2009-12-05T19:51:00.000Z	Roasted		dink -w onder wt* happened...
2009-12-05T19:52:00.000Z	Roasted		dink - it grabs an IP and subnet, but no gateway - gonna go reset the router, thanks for your help bro
2009-12-05T19:52:00.000Z	Dink	Roasted	good luck
