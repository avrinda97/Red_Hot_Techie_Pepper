2012-04-20T02:06:00.000Z	Artemis3	jAguAr`	uh oh...
2012-04-20T02:06:00.000Z	jAguAr`	Artemis3	what? that sounds bad
2012-04-20T02:06:00.000Z	Artemis3	jAguAr`	please stay with nouveau for now...
2012-04-20T02:07:00.000Z	Artemis3	jAguAr`	oh never mind, you still have a safe version
2012-04-20T02:07:00.000Z	Artemis3	jAguAr`	just open the restricted drivers thing (jockey)
2012-04-20T02:08:00.000Z	jAguAr`	Artemis3	i just downloaded some "updates" for ubuntu 12.04 this morning, and after that, gnome doesn't have any menus at all... i'm in a backed up version right now that isn't displaying properly
2012-04-20T02:08:00.000Z	Artemis3	jAguAr`	if you are in 12.04 (besides being in the wrong channel) do NOT use nvidia drivers
2012-04-20T02:09:00.000Z	jAguAr`	Artemis3	i'm in 11.10 right now... but its not displaying properly
2012-04-20T02:09:00.000Z	Artemis3	jAguAr`	ok then just use the restricted drivers app, should be in system menu
2012-04-20T02:19:00.000Z	jAguAr`	Artemis3	this xrandr isn't working
2012-04-20T02:20:00.000Z	Artemis3	jAguAr`	you can try just running jockey
2012-04-20T02:21:00.000Z	Artemis3	jAguAr`	jockey-gtk
2012-04-20T02:27:00.000Z	jAguAr`	Artemis3	i just tried using jockey and it kicked back this: http://pastebin.com/vxMmKzxJ
2012-04-20T02:29:00.000Z	Artemis3	jAguAr`	install nvidia-current and try again?
2012-04-20T02:29:00.000Z	jAguAr`	Artemis3	that's what i tried doing was installing the current
