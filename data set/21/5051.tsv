2008-05-24T07:25:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Invisionfree	it could be a bad printer driver, bad cups setting, or an incompatible printer
2008-05-24T07:25:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Starnestommy	I can print test pages.
2008-05-24T07:26:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Invisionfree	is anything able to print besides the test pages, or is everything failing besides the test pages?
2008-05-24T07:27:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Starnestommy	I don't even get the chance to TRY and print anything else .. is there a command to print from the command line?
2008-05-24T07:28:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Invisionfree	I'm not sure how to print from the command line, but I am pretty sure that it can be done

2008-05-24T07:32:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Starnestommy	I got the CLI printing (lpr <file>) but the freezing persists :(
2008-05-24T07:32:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Invisionfree	it sounds like it could be a bad driver or misconfigured printer settings
2008-05-24T07:33:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Starnestommy	That would cause things to freeze?
2008-05-24T07:33:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Invisionfree	it would
2008-05-24T07:33:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Starnestommy	I beleive the driver is fine. How can I check the printer settings?
2008-05-24T07:34:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Invisionfree	system > administration > print8ng
2008-05-24T07:34:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Starnestommy	What do I need to check?
2008-05-24T07:34:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Invisionfree	I'm not exactly sure what to check
2008-05-24T07:37:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Starnestommy	I believe it's configured right.
2008-05-24T07:38:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Starnestommy	It still freezes after I turn the printer off ..
2008-05-24T07:38:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Invisionfree	I'm sorry, I'm out of ideas
2008-05-24T07:40:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Starnestommy	I don't even get the chance to TRY and print anything else Why?\
2008-05-24T07:40:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Starnestommy	Oops, bad up arrow! :(
