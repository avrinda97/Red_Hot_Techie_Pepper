2008-11-19T18:06:00.000Z	ikonia	olskolirc	this is nothing to do with ubuntu, so offtopic, please look in a more appropriate channel
2008-11-19T18:07:00.000Z	ikonia	olskolirc	this is offtopic here,
2008-11-19T18:12:00.000Z	ikonia	olskolirc	#ubuntu-offtopic
2010-02-11T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	olskolirc	no such thing
2010-05-17T01:50:00.000Z	ikonia	olskolirc	it's called "windows" or "wine" make it clear what you're talkng about
2010-05-17T01:51:00.000Z	ikonia	olskolirc	it's called "wine" or "windows" - they are two seperate things, make it clear which one you are talking about
2010-05-17T01:51:00.000Z	olskolirc	ikonia	I'm talking about Internet Explorer and all the windows programs that comes in "wine-doors"
2010-05-17T01:52:00.000Z	ikonia	olskolirc	wine-doors IS wine, it's just a mangment tool for it
2010-05-17T01:52:00.000Z	ikonia	olskolirc	it's as safe as you allow it to be, if you have your machine locked down, the risk is minimal, you root it as root, then that's a risk
