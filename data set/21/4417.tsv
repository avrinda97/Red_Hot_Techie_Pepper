2008-05-31T09:27:00.000Z	chmac		Anyone know how much authority this page has? https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/installation-guide/hppa/mail-setup.html
2008-05-31T09:29:00.000Z	fde	chmac	what do you mean "authority"? that describes the default mail server... you are free to pick and choose whatever you want, it's your machine
2008-05-31T09:29:00.000Z	chmac	fde	It says mutt and exim will be installed by default, which they're not on my system
2008-05-31T09:30:00.000Z	fde	chmac	They should be... certainly exim4
2008-05-31T09:30:00.000Z	chmac	fde	I'm wondering if it's community contributed documentation, wiki style, so it might be completely wrong, or if I should tell someone that it's not necessarily correct
2008-05-31T09:30:00.000Z	chmac	fde	Hmm, exim4 definitely wasn't and isn't installed, but I'm not sure why
2008-05-31T09:30:00.000Z	chmac	fde	My /etc/aliases file was setup correctly though
2008-05-31T09:30:00.000Z	fde	chmac	It is wiki docs... but you can change it if it's completely wrong... I'm positive it's not though...
2008-05-31T09:31:00.000Z	chmac	fde	On my clean install, no mutt and no exim, actually, no working email at all
2008-05-31T09:31:00.000Z	fde	chmac	Note though that it describes the server distro... not the desktop system...
2008-05-31T09:32:00.000Z	chmac	fde	Aha, ok, in which case it's probably correct
2008-05-31T09:33:00.000Z	chmac	fde	I think this is the correct link for my i386 system https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/installation-guide/i386/mail-setup.html
2008-05-31T09:33:00.000Z	chmac	fde	It has the same info though, saying mutt / exim4 will be installed
2008-05-31T09:34:00.000Z	fde	chmac	Yup... you're right neither are on a desktop system... but on a server, yes
2008-05-31T09:34:00.000Z	chmac	fde	I'd have thought at least exim would make sense on a desktop system, without it I wasn't getting any mails from cron, etc
2008-05-31T09:35:00.000Z	chmac	fde	Any idea how I'd go about notifying someone to update it, or can I edit it directly somewhere?
2008-05-31T09:35:00.000Z	fde	chmac	log in and hit "edit" at the top
2008-05-31T09:36:00.000Z	chmac	fde	I don't see any login / edit / etc options on that page
2008-05-31T09:36:00.000Z	chmac	fde	Looking at the homepage, it looks like that page is aimed at the "alternate" i386 install
2008-05-31T09:36:00.000Z	fde	chmac	You have to log in to the wiki
2008-05-31T09:40:00.000Z	chmac	fde	I can't find that documentation page on the wiki anywhere...
