2008-01-24T02:20:00.000Z	FTANewbie		I am a windows user and am installing Ubuntu. I had to uninstall it and go back to windows because I couldn't enable the Broadcom WIFI driver. Can anyone explain how to do this in newbie terms? I dont know what the $#@! I am doing.
2008-01-24T02:20:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	Do you know which exact chipset it is?
2008-01-24T02:21:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	Like BCM4318 or something similar? I have two different Broadcom chipsets that I can help you with on it.
2008-01-24T02:21:00.000Z	FTANewbie	MrObvious	> no, it shows up as a Broadcom 43xx
2008-01-24T02:21:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	Can you get the make and model of your wi-fi card?
2008-01-24T02:22:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	Make and model laptop?
2008-01-24T02:23:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	EG Dell Vostro 1700
2008-01-24T02:24:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	Lemme Google it.
2008-01-24T02:26:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	Found it. It's a BCM4306.

2008-01-24T02:29:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	Reinstall Linux, but this time hook up the ethernet port to a router or something instead of using wireless until it can install wireless.
2008-01-24T02:32:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	How come you can't do that?
2008-01-24T02:35:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	Ahh. Maybe you can get the packages and install offline. Lemme try that.
2008-01-24T02:37:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	The link I gave you isn't hard at all.
2008-01-24T02:37:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	It's only involved.
2008-01-24T02:38:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	Download the latest ndiswrapper from here: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93482
2008-01-24T02:38:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	Are you gonna run Ubuntu 32 or 64 bit?
2008-01-24T02:39:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	Oh crud this is harder than I thought. :|
2008-01-24T02:42:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	You'll just have to get a wired ethernet connection first. Sorry but the guides I'm using aren't showing ways to do it.
2008-01-24T02:43:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	Maybe check this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=405990
2008-01-24T02:44:00.000Z	MrObvious	FTANewbie	Actually you can download it to your C:\ directory and access it through Ubuntu through the Places menu on the taskbar.
