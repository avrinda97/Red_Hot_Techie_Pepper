2009-12-08T11:28:00.000Z	mneptok	aSt3raL	did you subscribe to the VyperVPN service?
2009-12-08T11:28:00.000Z	aSt3raL		kk
2009-12-08T11:28:00.000Z	aSt3raL		yeah

2009-12-08T11:29:00.000Z	mneptok	aSt3raL	then i would contact their technical support team and ask how to set it up. you're a paying customer.
2009-12-08T11:29:00.000Z	aSt3raL		giga news doesnt have an easy ubuntu thing
2009-12-08T11:29:00.000Z	aSt3raL		ok
2009-12-08T11:29:00.000Z	aSt3raL		you guys dont know how?
2009-12-08T11:30:00.000Z	aSt3raL		i know ubuntu pretty well but not really vpn
2009-12-08T11:30:00.000Z	mneptok	aSt3raL	is it an IPSec or PPPtP type VPN?
2009-12-08T11:31:00.000Z	aSt3raL		i think its PPtP
2009-12-08T11:31:00.000Z	aSt3raL		like i said im new to vpn
2009-12-08T11:31:00.000Z	mneptok	aSt3raL	"i think" doesn't count. no one can help you if you're guessing. ;)  this is why i think it best you contact GigaNews.
