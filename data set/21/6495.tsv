2007-11-23T19:56:00.000Z	kazol		How do I make the booting process more verbose? Removing the "quiet" grub switch is not enough.
2007-11-23T19:58:00.000Z	Slart	kazol	isn't there some kind of debug-swith you can use?
2007-11-23T19:58:00.000Z	kazol	Slart	I'll look it up.
2007-11-23T20:13:00.000Z	Slart	kazol	sudo is for command line.. gksudo is for X software
2007-11-23T20:13:00.000Z	Slart	kazol	using sudo for gui software is bad.. very bad
2007-11-23T20:13:00.000Z	kazol	Slart	So I should always do "gksudo gedit"?
2007-11-23T20:13:00.000Z	Slart	kazol	yes
2007-12-10T03:37:00.000Z	Slart	kazol	what's the problem?
2007-12-10T03:38:00.000Z	Slart	kazol	what happens if you try to delete it using ... say.. Nautilus? (nautilus=the file manager in gnome)
2007-12-10T03:40:00.000Z	Slart	kazol	those are some weird looking folders.. have you checked the drive for errors?
2007-12-10T03:42:00.000Z	kazol	Slart	Surfing *without* an IP???
2007-12-10T03:43:00.000Z	Slart	kazol	yes.. I guess you could use some kind of proxy and communicate with the proxy using.. perhaps some weird network without ip-numbers... that would be surfing without an ip, right ? =)
2007-12-10T03:44:00.000Z	kazol	Slart	I've heard of "IP spoofing" but I don't understand how it's possible on a DSL/cable modem.
2007-12-10T03:45:00.000Z	Slart	kazol	where is this download - folder of yours, the one you can't delete?
2007-12-10T03:46:00.000Z	kazol	Slart	There are folders (that act weird and cannot be deleted) within Downloads; I'll try to fsck the partition.
2007-12-10T03:47:00.000Z	Slart	kazol	I had something like that happen to me once.. was a usb memory and I couldn't delete certain folders.. fsck found errors on the drive, fixed those and then I could delete the folders..
2007-12-10T03:48:00.000Z	kazol	Slart	So I umount the ext3 LVM LUKS RAID partition and fsck it?
2007-12-10T03:49:00.000Z	Slart	kazol	ouch.. you're using raid and lvm.. never done that... can't really say if that's the way or not.. sorry
2007-12-10T04:02:00.000Z	kazol	Slart	timewriter: I found a way to rm the dirs-I just did it on the server. Turns out Ubuntu didn't recognize Cyrillic.
2007-12-10T04:02:00.000Z	Slart	kazol	oh? how did you delete it then? command line?
2007-12-22T04:48:00.000Z	Slart	kazol	if they are on the desktop they should be fairly safe to delete.. I don't know how happy cedega will be though
