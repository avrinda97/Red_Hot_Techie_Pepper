2007-06-28T09:31:00.000Z	Upsal		hi, i'm going to install ubuntu feisty (server) on a PC with 1 HD, with total space 20 GB. Currently i'm having 1 pri NTFS partition (10 GB), what is the best way to partionate the rest of the unlocated space for ubuntu?
2007-06-28T09:33:00.000Z	Upsal		ok, when i choose to make a 9.5 GB part, and a 0.5 GB swap, what kind of type should i choose? pri of log?
2007-06-28T09:35:00.000Z	tovella	Upsal	do you already have partitions on that drive?
2007-06-28T09:35:00.000Z	Upsal	tovella	i have 10 gb windows (primary and ntfs)
2007-06-28T09:35:00.000Z	Upsal		and i want to run ubuntu feisty in dual boot
2007-06-28T09:35:00.000Z	Upsal		total of 20 GB
2007-06-28T09:35:00.000Z	tovella	Upsal	then you should be ok to set up two more partions as primary.
2007-06-28T09:36:00.000Z	Upsal		10 GB free now, but i don't know how to fill in
2007-06-28T09:36:00.000Z	tovella	Upsal	actually threee more.
2007-06-28T09:37:00.000Z	tovella	Upsal	fill in?  what you need to do is resize the existing windows partition to make room to create another one.  give the fact that it's an NTFS partition, you may have to use a special utility to do this.
2007-06-28T09:38:00.000Z	tovella	Upsal	...to create another two.
2007-06-28T09:42:00.000Z	Upsal		how should i create my swap partition, i can choose to mount it as root, or as media or tmp, which should i choose?
2007-06-28T09:43:00.000Z	Upsal		how does it know that that part. is a swap part.?
2007-06-28T09:45:00.000Z	Upsal		what should i choose as part type?
2007-06-28T09:45:00.000Z	Upsal		know it's a ext3 unmounted
2007-06-28T09:45:00.000Z	tovella	Upsal	after doing some checking i found there is a GParted LiveCD that should work to do this.  Download the .iso file, burn a CD from it, defragment your windows partition, then boot from the  GParted LiveCD.
2007-06-28T09:45:00.000Z	Upsal		thx tovella
2007-06-28T09:46:00.000Z	Upsal		i need to make a swap during my install of ubuntu
2007-06-28T09:46:00.000Z	Upsal		my install is warning me that i don't have a swap partition created
2007-06-28T09:46:00.000Z	Upsal		how? :P
2007-06-28T09:46:00.000Z	tovella	Upsal	didn't you create 2 partitions?
