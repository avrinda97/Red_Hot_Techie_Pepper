2011-05-21T01:33:00.000Z	lillem4n		My touchpad stops working after sleep. Is there a way to force-detect and make it working again?
2011-05-21T01:34:00.000Z	lillem4n		It sucks to have to always reboot my laptop when I close the lid :S
2011-05-21T01:35:00.000Z	nit-wit	lillem4n	you shouldn't you need the edit the lid part i gconf-editer then power

2011-05-21T01:40:00.000Z	lillem4n	nit-wit	yup?
2011-05-21T01:41:00.000Z	nit-wit	lillem4n	change the lidsc and lid battery to do nothong by doble clicking to edit. then close go to your power gui and lok at the lid buttons should be a do nothing or nothing there.
2011-05-21T01:41:00.000Z	lillem4n	nit-wit	Oh... but doesnt that make the computer not sleep when I close the lid?
2011-05-21T01:43:00.000Z	nit-wit	lillem4n	adds nothing to the lid controls in power
2011-05-21T01:44:00.000Z	nit-wit	lillem4n	do you have your lid set to hibernate rather then sleep is that the problem.
2011-05-21T01:44:00.000Z	lillem4n	nit-wit	I think it was set to suspend before I changed to "Do nothing"
2011-05-21T01:46:00.000Z	lillem4n	nit-wit	Nope. Touchpad still dies when I suspend the computer
2011-05-21T01:47:00.000Z	nit-wit	lillem4n	ah touchpad so it dies so you can restart with it? does the touchpad work after woken up?
2011-05-21T01:47:00.000Z	lillem4n	nit-wit	Nope. Touchpad is always dead after woke up. If I plug in a USB mouse it works fine. But I have to reboot to get the touchpad working again :S
2011-05-21T01:48:00.000Z	nit-wit	lillem4n	I have seen this problem posted on occasion at the Ubuntu Forums a search on google with the forum name and the problem may get you some more info as well.
2011-05-21T01:49:00.000Z	lillem4n	nit-wit	Yeah. I'm gonna dig :) Thanks a lot for the help so far :)
2011-05-21T01:49:00.000Z	nit-wit	lillem4n	I wish I knew an answer I have mine turned off lol.;)
