2006-06-19T13:30:00.000Z	elknof3		hi everybody...  how can i check how many video i have assigned, and hom many is left for RAM??
2006-06-19T13:30:00.000Z	SeanTater	elknof3	"how many assigned", explain
2006-06-19T13:32:00.000Z	elknof3	SeanTater	Kb... like how many MB to video and to RAM, since i have and internal chipset for video
2006-06-19T13:32:00.000Z	SeanTater	elknof3	The video card decides how much memory it gets, it should say on the box. Even if you could see it there would be nothing you could do about it
2006-06-19T13:32:00.000Z	SeanTater	elknof3	with onboard, probably about 15 MB
2006-06-19T13:33:00.000Z	SeanTater	elknof3	or less
2006-06-19T13:34:00.000Z	elknof3	SeanTater	when i configured it for 3Dacceleration i was able to decide the qtty for video, but im not sure if it works the same as win, cause in win, it takes from RAM, but not as sharing but as a totally apart resouce
2006-06-19T13:35:00.000Z	elknof3	SeanTater	or at least thats what i thoght
2006-06-19T13:35:00.000Z	SeanTater	elknof3	I'm not aware it;s possible for it to do that
2006-06-19T13:36:00.000Z	SeanTater	elknof3	even so, why do you need it?
2006-06-19T13:38:00.000Z	elknof3	SeanTater	i'm trying to run epsxe (plastation emu) but it's been a challenge, cause i've been configured the video acceleration and all that stuff, but i just cant have the epsxe syncronized, like if i make the reolution too big, te sound gets slow and viceversa...
2006-06-19T13:38:00.000Z	SeanTater	elknof3	how many MB ram do you have?
2006-06-19T13:39:00.000Z	elknof3	SeanTater	915 integrated, 512 RAM
2006-06-19T13:39:00.000Z	SeanTater	elknof3	okay -- integrated cards are not made for any big games or anything, they barely do word processing
2006-06-19T13:40:00.000Z	elknof3	SeanTater	when in win i was able to run splinter cell, counter strike, and games a little bit weighted...  so i thought i could do the same with epsxe....
2006-06-19T13:40:00.000Z	SeanTater	elknof3	I do not see how that is possible -- but from here I;m not that much help anyway
2006-06-19T13:41:00.000Z	SeanTater	elknof3	keep asking around
2006-06-19T13:41:00.000Z	elknof3	SeanTater	yeah thanks a lot anyway...
2006-06-19T13:41:00.000Z	SeanTater	elknof3	sometimes #ubuntu-offtopiv can be helpful too
2006-06-19T13:41:00.000Z	SeanTater	elknof3	sometimes #ubuntu-offtopic can be helpful too
2006-06-22T13:17:00.000Z	SeanTater	elknof3	actually seen #ubuntu-pl, he's already there
