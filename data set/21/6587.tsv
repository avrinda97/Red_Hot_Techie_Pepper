2007-03-03T12:02:00.000Z	ofeigsfjardt		Can anyone help me with my soundcard? alsamixer reports "snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device". I think that I don't have a module loaded for my soundcard. Any ideas?
2007-03-03T12:03:00.000Z	gyaresu	ofeigsfjardt	'asoundconf list'
2007-03-03T12:05:00.000Z	gyaresu	ofeigsfjardt	'asoundconf list'
2007-03-03T12:09:00.000Z	ofeigsfjardt	gyaresu	it did nothing :/
2007-03-03T12:09:00.000Z	gyaresu	ofeigsfjardt	then the right drivers aren't loaded. 'lspci'
2007-03-03T12:10:00.000Z	ofeigsfjardt	gyaresu	ok, so now what? i think i found what the device is
2007-03-03T12:11:00.000Z	gyaresu	ofeigsfjardt	Could you post the one line that refers to the sound chip please.
2007-03-03T12:16:00.000Z	ofeigsfjardt	gyaresu	I think this is it: 00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 440BX/ZX/DX - 82443BX/ZX/DX AGP bridge (rev 02)
2007-03-03T12:16:00.000Z	gyaresu	ofeigsfjardt	no. Look for something that sa... just pastebin the output.

2007-03-03T12:27:00.000Z	ofeigsfjardt	gyaresu	http://dpaste.com/6359/ don't want to bug because i see that you are helpging someone else, but i just wanted to see if you got the message
2007-03-03T12:29:00.000Z	gyaresu	ofeigsfjardt	No problem. You don't have a sound card installed. Maybe it's turned off in the bios.
2007-03-03T12:29:00.000Z	ofeigsfjardt	gyaresu	i didn't see anything about it in the bios
2007-03-03T12:30:00.000Z	gyaresu	ofeigsfjardt	Is it the onboard sound or a card? Could it be broken?
2007-03-03T12:36:00.000Z	ofeigsfjardt	gyaresu	onboard. i think it could be working. at least when i plug them in i can get normal pc speaker noises (beaps from the terminal and such)
2007-03-03T12:36:00.000Z	gyaresu	ofeigsfjardt	your lspci bets to differ. 'asound list' gave you nothing right?
2007-03-03T12:37:00.000Z	ofeigsfjardt	gyaresu	yeah nothing
2007-03-03T12:37:00.000Z	gyaresu	ofeigsfjardt	So I still say that there is no device relating to a sound card detected in that machine.
2007-03-03T12:37:00.000Z	gyaresu	ofeigsfjardt	sorry.
2007-03-03T13:00:00.000Z	ofeigsfjardt	gyaresu	ok well thanks anyway for your help
2007-03-03T13:00:00.000Z	gyaresu	ofeigsfjardt	Sorry. Without 'lspci' finding a sound device we can't go much further...
