2008-07-21T07:49:00.000Z	dbbolton		<arvind_khadri>if startx doesn't work, why would anything else work?
2008-07-21T07:50:00.000Z	dbbolton		<arvind_khadri> like i said, startx
2008-07-21T07:51:00.000Z	unop	dbbolton	how does startx fail?
2008-07-21T07:51:00.000Z	dbbolton	unop	here is the output of startx http://pastebin.us/?show=d4464addf
2008-07-21T07:53:00.000Z	unop	dbbolton	well, the error message here says xorg is using the xorg.conf and it has no modes defined - why don't you edit the xorg.conf and explicitly set the modes
2008-07-21T07:54:00.000Z	dbbolton	unop	let me show you the xorg.conf
2008-07-21T07:54:00.000Z	dbbolton	unop	Bruners here it is http://pastebin.us/?show=d5ecdb46f
2008-07-21T07:57:00.000Z	dbbolton	unop	did you see any problem with my xorg.conf ?
2008-07-21T07:58:00.000Z	unop	dbbolton	yea, i'm just looking to see how the radeon driver is being used rather than vesa as per your xorg.conf
2008-07-21T07:58:00.000Z	dbbolton	unop	i tried ati driver then vesa
2008-07-21T08:00:00.000Z	unop	dbbolton	have you tried reconfiguring xorg with dpkg-reconfigure -plow xserver-xorg ?
2008-07-21T08:00:00.000Z	dbbolton	unop	i haven't tried the -plow option
2008-07-21T08:00:00.000Z	dbbolton	unop	what does it do differently?
2008-07-21T08:00:00.000Z	unop	dbbolton	well, that wouldn't really make a difference
2008-07-21T08:01:00.000Z	unop	dbbolton	just wondering how xorg.conf was created when you tried that command
2008-07-21T08:01:00.000Z	dbbolton	unop	i can try it again
2008-07-21T08:01:00.000Z	unop	dbbolton	ok, pastebin xorg.conf when you are done
2008-07-21T08:02:00.000Z	dbbolton	unop	ok brb
2008-07-21T08:09:00.000Z	dbbolton	unop	you still around?
2009-04-22T10:39:00.000Z	unop	dbbolton	hostname -f
