2006-11-29T14:41:00.000Z	rsl		Is it better [storage-wise]  to store a lot of files in one folder or to create subfolders for the files?
2006-11-29T14:42:00.000Z	LjL	rsl	hm? what do you mean "storage-wise"? it doesn't really make a big difference to most filesystems. it's mostly a matter of how you want to organize your files.
2006-11-29T14:42:00.000Z	rsl	LjL	so it's not going to be any worse if I just throw them all in a single directory? [Other than the maintenance issue?
2006-11-29T14:43:00.000Z	LjL	rsl	traversing the directory will take a little longer. unless you're talking literally thousands of files, though, i doubt it'd make any practical difference
2006-11-29T14:45:00.000Z	rsl	LjL	When you say traversing you're talking about code going through each filename? I'm writing an application for a server and don't really traverse the folders in that sense but I do seek out the files by name. Would that be affected?
2006-11-29T14:47:00.000Z	LjL	rsl	going through each filename, yes - that, or something a bit smarter, must be done by the system everytime you refer to a file by name. i think ext3 really does just go through each filename, but i'm not really sure. how many files are we talking about anyway?
2006-11-29T14:48:00.000Z	rsl	LjL	I can't say really... It'd depend on how many or how few the user uploaded to the server.
2006-11-29T14:49:00.000Z	rsl	LjL	it's a single-user app though so it wouldn't [hopefully]  be in the thousands of anything but it might.
2006-11-29T14:51:00.000Z	LjL	rsl	this might be of some interest http://www.nabble.com/extremely-slow-"ls"-on-a-cleared-fatty-ext3-directory-on-FC4-5-t2097948.html -- it would look like the dir_index feature of ext3 being turned on vs off would make a big difference in "flat-directory-with-tons-of-files" scenarios
2006-11-29T14:52:00.000Z	rsl	LjL	I was blown away by that first line: "A stupid flat directory /tmp holding 5 millon files"! Heh, indeed.
2006-11-29T14:52:00.000Z	LjL	rsl	well, if it really does hold *five million* files, then yes, i'd not be surprised indexing is slow =)
2006-11-29T14:53:00.000Z	rsl	LjL	I'm seriously stymied by the idea of 5 million files in /tmp! /TMP, I say!
2006-11-29T14:57:00.000Z	rsl	LjL	my app would use around 500 [5 attachments per page and 100 pages for a gallery-type site]  to 1000 [2 attachments per page and 500 pages for a blog-type site]  I guess. Sound reasonable in a single folder?
2006-11-29T14:58:00.000Z	LjL	rsl	if you have enough RAM, yes. the directory would basically stay cached in RAM all the time, so you'd hardly notice a performance impact i think
2006-11-29T15:00:00.000Z	rsl	LjL	Thanks for your help.
2007-06-02T06:18:00.000Z	LjL	rsl	musicbrainz?
2007-06-02T06:18:00.000Z	rsl	LjL	can grip interface with that?
2007-06-02T06:19:00.000Z	LjL	rsl	doesn't seem like it
2007-06-02T06:19:00.000Z	rsl	LjL	oooh this url might be promising: http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/FreeDBGateway
2007-06-02T06:21:00.000Z	LjL	rsl	oh, that must be new
2007-06-02T06:22:00.000Z	rsl	LjL	yeah. I literally saw that as you were typing. :)
