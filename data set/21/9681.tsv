2005-08-01T14:59:00.000Z	djsar		 >>DO NOT USE BREEZY YET why not? is it too unstable?
2005-08-01T15:00:00.000Z	siretart	djsar	X is currently very broken
2005-08-01T15:00:00.000Z	djsar	siretart	probs with gcc i think?
2005-08-01T15:01:00.000Z	siretart	djsar	rather probs with modularisation: breezy will ship xorg7
2005-08-01T15:01:00.000Z	djsar	siretart	that would be nice..
2005-08-01T15:04:00.000Z	djsar	siretart	where can i see free jobs to be done? (testing, artwork or python-codin?)
2005-08-01T15:04:00.000Z	siretart	djsar	oh, there is in fact a lot work left to do
2005-08-01T15:05:00.000Z	siretart	djsar	just hang around in appropriate mailinglist and irc channels you are interested in helping out, and do stuff. It will be appreciated!
2005-08-01T15:05:00.000Z	djsar	siretart	thats why i ask, im usin fedora 4 and its broken like hell..
2005-08-01T15:06:00.000Z	djsar	siretart	so where can i see those hanging jobs?
2005-08-01T15:06:00.000Z	siretart	djsar	we don't have time to write them out ;) - in what area would you like to help out?
2005-08-01T15:07:00.000Z	djsar	siretart	i could do testing, artwork and some coding in python
2005-08-01T15:07:00.000Z	djsar	siretart	my C or C++ is too bad to be usefull
2005-08-01T15:09:00.000Z	siretart	djsar	for artwork have a look at http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-art
2005-08-01T15:10:00.000Z	siretart	djsar	for helping out in universe, perhaps in giving love to python packages in universe, join us in #ubuntu-motu and see, if packaging would be a job for you
2005-08-01T15:10:00.000Z	siretart	djsar	for testing: sure, as soon as xorg is functional again, upgrade to breezy and commit bugs to bugzilla and/or malone :)
2005-08-01T15:11:00.000Z	djsar	siretart	but in this state xorg would not start? am i right?
2005-08-01T15:12:00.000Z	siretart	djsar	well, without X, you would be restricted to console only apps ;)
2005-08-01T15:13:00.000Z	siretart	djsar	well in fact, you could install breezy in a chroot, and start/test application from there
2005-08-01T15:14:00.000Z	djsar	siretart	thx i read in those lists..
