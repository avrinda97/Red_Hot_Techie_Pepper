2008-12-04T02:24:00.000Z	kek		is there a pointy clicky way to switch to another x server driver?
2008-12-04T02:24:00.000Z	Slart	kek	that would be either the restricted drivers manager.. or envy-ng
2008-12-04T02:26:00.000Z	kek	Slart	is envyng included on the ubuntu install disc? because the graphics worked fine there
2008-12-04T02:26:00.000Z	kek	Slart	8.10
2008-12-04T02:26:00.000Z	Slart	kek	I don't think so.. but the restricted drivers manager is
2008-12-04T02:26:00.000Z	kek	Slart	the install interfaces uses nonfree drivers?
2008-12-04T02:27:00.000Z	Slart	kek	no, I doubt that..but the 2d drivers work pretty well.. not sure if it uses vesa
2008-12-04T02:28:00.000Z	kek	Slart	so how do i get that same setup as i had when i started up with the installation disc?
2008-12-04T02:29:00.000Z	Slart	kek	have you installed another driver?
2008-12-04T02:30:00.000Z	kek	Slart	i might have a long time ago, i used to be messing around with x server configurations and video drivers for days, and now i upgraded to 8.10 and saw that it was automatically configured in a good way on the setup disc so i was thinking maybe they fixed it somehow so it works automatically
2008-12-04T02:34:00.000Z	Slart	kek	well.. it should be almost automatic.. not sure how to go back to the default driver thingy though..
2008-12-04T02:34:00.000Z	Slart	kek	perhaps someone else knows of a clever way
2008-12-04T02:35:00.000Z	kek	Slart	i will probably try with uninstalling all X packages and installing them again
2008-12-04T02:36:00.000Z	kek	Slart	because now it just says "right, you need to run low graphics mode" when I start X
2008-12-04T02:37:00.000Z	Slart	kek	mm.. that safe-graphics-mode thingy.. I've never been on good terms with that one..
2008-12-04T02:38:00.000Z	kek	Slart	i don't care about 3d and proprietary drivers etc, i just want to have a little acceleration so i can try out the flashy effects and Beryl etc
2008-12-04T02:38:00.000Z	Slart	kek	hehe.. flashy effects and beryl *is* about 3d.. =)
2008-12-04T02:39:00.000Z	kek	Slart	ok :) well i'm booted into the install disc now and there are a lot of effects that i don't get in my installed system so obviously the computer supports something and i have the wrong driver.
2008-12-04T02:40:00.000Z	kek	Slart	glxinfo says i have direct rendering
2008-12-04T03:41:00.000Z	kek	Slart	removing (purging) all the xserver-* and installing them again helped. now i have animations! :)
2008-12-04T03:42:00.000Z	Slart	kek	yay =)
