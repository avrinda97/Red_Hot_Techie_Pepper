2004-10-02T11:41:00.000Z	schweeb	jm_	edit /etc/modules and remove "lp"
2004-10-02T11:41:00.000Z	schweeb	jm_	then reboot, and check if lp, parport_pc, or parport are still loaded
2004-10-02T11:41:00.000Z	schweeb	jm_	which they shouldn't be
2004-10-02T11:41:00.000Z	schweeb	jm_	if they are, I'll have to tell you how to blacklist them
2004-10-02T11:42:00.000Z	jm_	schweeb	time to reboot. i'll be back
2004-10-02T11:45:00.000Z	jm_	schweeb	no lp in /etc/modules
2004-10-02T11:45:00.000Z	schweeb	jm_	lsmod | grep parport
2004-10-02T11:46:00.000Z	schweeb	jm_	edit /etc/hotplug/blacklist
2004-10-02T11:46:00.000Z	schweeb	jm_	add lp, parport, and parport_pc to the end
