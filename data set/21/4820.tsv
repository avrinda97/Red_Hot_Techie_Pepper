2008-02-05T08:15:00.000Z	Falco98		anyone know if there's a trick to squeeze a linux install onto a disc which is already half-full of valuable data in NTFS?
2008-02-05T08:16:00.000Z	Falco98		i.e. could the linux installer (or any other tool) make a new partition without destroying the current one?
2008-02-05T08:16:00.000Z	bazhang	Falco98	sure
2008-02-05T08:16:00.000Z	Falco98	bazhang	can you give me some quick details?
2008-02-05T08:17:00.000Z	bazhang	Falco98	you mean a dual boot?
2008-02-05T08:17:00.000Z	bazhang	Falco98	vista installed first?
2008-02-05T08:17:00.000Z	Falco98	bazhang	yeah, that's what i'd like to end up with, but my point is, the disk i want to install on already has an NTFS partition that i don't want to destroy.. even if it's not full
2008-02-05T08:17:00.000Z	Falco98	bazhang	xp, but yeah it's already windows'd
2008-02-05T08:20:00.000Z	bazhang	Falco98	so you have multiple partitions on this disk?
2008-02-05T08:21:00.000Z	Falco98	bazhang	yeah; one is a small partition with XP on it, and is almost full.  the other contains all my data, and is about half full.  Optimally I'd like to ... er, make a new partition using the empty space on this drive, and put linux on it in a multi-boot type situation.
2008-02-05T08:21:00.000Z	Falco98	bazhang	the problem is, i'm *just* familiar enough with partitioning to know that this has always been impossible, at least with traditional DOS partitioning tools... but I don't know what Linux can do...
2008-02-05T08:28:00.000Z	bazhang	Falco98	this is possible--though you should back up important stuff as always
2008-02-05T08:29:00.000Z	Falco98	bazhang	oh?  can you point me in the right direction?  important stuff is pretty well backed-up atm, though i'll make copies onto external drives and stuff before i get too deep
2008-02-05T08:30:00.000Z	Falco98	bazhang	thanks, i'll check it out..
2008-02-05T08:30:00.000Z	bazhang	Falco98	there is also a youtube video ;]
2008-02-05T08:31:00.000Z	Falco98	bazhang	is it linked from that page, i guess?
2008-02-05T08:31:00.000Z	Falco98	bazhang	iirc, isn't the linux installer smarter about these things?
2008-02-05T08:32:00.000Z	bazhang	Falco98	it can pass the turing test imo
2008-02-05T08:35:00.000Z	Falco98	bazhang	do you happen to know whether that partitioning installer allows a user to choose a different HD to rearrange the partitions on, etc?
2008-02-05T08:36:00.000Z	bazhang	Falco98	though gparted is used on the installer--you might be better off with the gparted live cd for that--just my 2 cents
2008-02-05T08:36:00.000Z	Falco98	bazhang	oh, use the gparted liveCD and then use the linux installer once it's done?
