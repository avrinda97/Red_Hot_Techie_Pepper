2009-03-24T17:19:00.000Z	gartral		how do i tell if my fm tuner is working correctly?
2009-03-24T17:20:00.000Z	mneptok	gartral	by listening to the radio through it? *shrug*
2009-03-24T17:22:00.000Z	gartral	mneptok	right, what/how do i point too it, it appears to be contained on my gfx card
2009-03-24T17:34:00.000Z	mneptok	gartral	do the FM and TV tuners on that card have Linux drivers?
2009-03-24T17:34:00.000Z	mneptok	gartral	did the vendor make some? did they allow the Linux community to make some?
2009-03-24T17:35:00.000Z	gartral	mneptok	ive seen linux systems running this card use the tv tuner, yes, but no clue for the FM, beyond that, i have no idea, i would assume nvidias restricted drivers would cover all that, as this is an MX 400
2009-03-24T17:36:00.000Z	gartral	mneptok	i suppose going and installing mythTV or tvtime and seeing if they recognise it would work, hmm?
2009-03-24T17:39:00.000Z	mneptok	gartral	that's a big assumption. before you start actually trying to make it work, you should see what nVidia believes this card can do with their Linux drivers.
2009-03-24T17:39:00.000Z	mneptok	gartral	again, what you are describing is an hours-long process. why not just go look at the nVidia Linux documentation? it may well say "The FM tuner does not work with our Linux driver." in which case 3 minutes of research saves 3 hours of frustration.
2009-03-24T17:40:00.000Z	gartral	mneptok	have you ever tried getting info off of nvidias site, its quite painfull
2009-03-24T17:41:00.000Z	mneptok	gartral	this is why i don't buy nVidia hardware
2009-03-24T17:41:00.000Z	gartral	mneptok	and besides, this is a legacy card, and there documention is lacking
2009-03-24T17:47:00.000Z	gartral	mneptok	it appears as though the card does have internal drivers for tv and fm, and all i need is a tv tuner app
2009-03-24T17:50:00.000Z	gartral	mneptok	starting download/install of myth, hope it worksd
2009-06-30T05:07:00.000Z	mneptok	gartral	better than "babbling" on like a "buffoon." ;)
2009-07-16T07:01:00.000Z	mneptok	gartral	funny that your choice of dictionary misspells "obliterate"
2009-07-16T07:01:00.000Z	gartral	mneptok	that would just be my lousy paws
2010-08-30T13:15:00.000Z	mneptok	gartral	but they may be able to differentiate between "they are" and "their"
2010-08-30T13:17:00.000Z	gartral	mneptok	auto-correction chose wrong word. I'm not inheriently that bad with grammar.
2010-08-30T13:17:00.000Z	mneptok	gartral	"inherently"
2012-02-29T21:26:00.000Z	mneptok	gartral	why the relative path in that EXPORT? make it full and see.
