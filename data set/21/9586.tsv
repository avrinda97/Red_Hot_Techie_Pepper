2009-09-14T22:39:00.000Z	obiwan_		i did it, but that restarted the whole session NakidGirl_With_I
2009-09-14T22:39:00.000Z	obiwan_		kill /usr/X11R6/bin/X
2009-09-14T22:40:00.000Z	obiwan_		but X is a program like any other else, can't i just restart it? like i would restart ssh daemon or any other?
2009-09-14T22:41:00.000Z	obiwan_		hmm ok i'll try with -1
2009-09-14T22:41:00.000Z	obiwan_		yeah icreoot, but jaunty disabled it
2009-09-14T22:41:00.000Z	obiwan_		but what's the terminal command that does?
2009-09-14T22:41:00.000Z	obiwan_		but can i do what ctrl alt del does in terminal? running a command?
2009-09-14T22:42:00.000Z	durt	obiwan_	ya , it's what you don't want. sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart.
2009-09-14T22:42:00.000Z	obiwan_		yeah but what does ctrl alt backspace tell the system, i want to know to start it in terminal and not stroking keys
2009-09-14T22:43:00.000Z	obiwan_		but gdm restarts EVERYTHING, firefox, xchat
2009-09-14T22:43:00.000Z	obiwan_		i just want to restart the server and it load again everything
2009-09-14T22:43:00.000Z	obiwan_		and what does startx ?
2009-09-14T22:44:00.000Z	obiwan_		you say restart gdm, but what does startx? why should i restart the whole gnome and not simply x?
2009-09-14T22:44:00.000Z	obiwan_		but xdm will only restart the login windows won't it?
2009-09-14T22:45:00.000Z	obiwan_		i read about xdm it's just a part of the x window system, which prompts login and password in graphical mode
2009-09-14T22:45:00.000Z	obiwan_	jrib	i'll chek
2009-09-14T22:46:00.000Z	durt	obiwan_	xdm,gdm,kdm, are all display managers that control login and X.
2009-09-14T22:46:00.000Z	obiwan_		yeah ice but isn't kdm or gdm just the login prompt you get when you boot?
2009-09-14T22:46:00.000Z	obiwan_		w8 please
2009-09-14T22:46:00.000Z	durt	obiwan_	that and more
