2012-07-31T18:32:00.000Z	L3top	RomeoAva	then you have the correct video drivers in use.
2012-07-31T18:39:00.000Z	L3top	RomeoAva	what I am telling you, is that your video drivers are up to date. There is nothing further to do... are you having some sort of problem?
2012-07-31T18:47:00.000Z	L3top	RomeoAva	lspci -nnk | grep VGA -A2 | grep -i kernel
2012-07-31T18:48:00.000Z	L3top	RomeoAva	lspci | grep VGA | wc -l
2012-07-31T18:49:00.000Z	L3top	RomeoAva	this looks like a laptop with hybrid graphics.
2012-07-31T18:49:00.000Z	L3top	RomeoAva	is that correct?
2012-07-31T18:49:00.000Z	L3top	RomeoAva	is this a laptop?
2012-07-31T18:51:00.000Z	L3top	RomeoAva	your hardware is completely unsupported in linux by nVidia unfortunately. Your best bet is using a third party software for this purpose called bumblebee
2012-07-31T18:53:00.000Z	L3top	RomeoAva	Did you understand my last reply?
2012-07-31T18:54:00.000Z	L3top	RomeoAva	There is NO support for linux by the manufacturer (nVidia) nor do they plan to EVER provide support for it. There is a group out there that created their own solution for it, the projects name is bumblebee
2012-07-31T18:58:00.000Z	L3top	RomeoAva	it is a shame the manufacturers have 0 linux support. Same with the ATI side.
