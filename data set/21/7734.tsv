2010-05-20T04:36:00.000Z	michelle__		question for all... I am looking for FREE on-line resources that teach linux basics and admin
2010-05-20T04:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	Ubuntu Pocket Guide is also good
2010-05-20T04:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	well in that case really you need to learn more than one distro as well I guess

2010-05-20T04:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	typo  http://www.distrowatch.com
2010-05-20T04:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	if you want to learn Linux you would learn more using Gentoo or Slackware or ArchLinux or something like that :D  however those are not easy to learn.  Ubuntu is based on Debian,  Debian is one of the first Linux distros goes back to 1993.  Oh and Slackware goes back to then as well, and is the oldest distro that is still being updated after all the time.
2010-05-20T04:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	Ubuntu isn't really a geeks distro,   that's what BlAck6j73  meant.  Ubuntu never really was for geeks though, and its becoming even less so now, because they want to target the mainstreame Windows and Mac OS X users.  However computer geeks use it as well.
2010-05-20T04:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	 Novell Suse Enterprise Linux is also pretty popular at the moment,  and OpenSuse on the desktop.  However Novell aren't liked much at all these days, by quite a lot of people in the Linux community,  however thats also quite off topic for this channel.
2010-05-20T04:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	Ubuntu will do as a first distro to learn,  then you will want to learn  stuff like  Debian, CentOS, and Fedora I expect, and then more complex distros such as Gentoo, Slackware, and ArchLinux maybe even.
2010-05-20T05:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	oh
2010-05-20T05:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	I meant since the patents deal with Microsoft and Mono.  not sure if you know what I mean
2010-05-20T05:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	enteprise one or OpenSuse or both?
2010-05-20T05:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	indeed, however
2010-05-20T05:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	according to history so far,  distro's only get like five years or so as number one on the desktop
2010-05-20T05:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	however I think Ubuntu will have quite a few more years as number one on the desktop
2010-05-20T05:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	Redhat Enterprise Linux is for businesses and as maco mentioned earlier theres CentOS if your wanting to learn Redhat
2010-05-20T09:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	on the MBR
2010-05-20T09:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	Master Boot Record
2010-05-20T09:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	oh raid hrm
2010-05-20T10:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	normally Grub goes on the MBR
2010-05-20T10:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	michelle__	I think thats also the case with RAID
