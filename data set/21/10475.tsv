2005-09-27T07:26:00.000Z	delire	gach	no alsaconf in Ubuntu (as with debian).

2005-09-27T07:31:00.000Z	delire	gach	there is no configuration script for sound in ubuntu, nothing like alsaconfig..
2005-09-27T07:31:00.000Z	delire	gach	right.. lspci. what is the card?
2005-09-27T07:33:00.000Z	delire	gach	modprobe -l | grep snd
2005-09-27T07:34:00.000Z	delire	gach	do you have the drivers for the card loaded?
2005-09-27T07:34:00.000Z	gach	delire	i got all the kernel drivers
2005-09-27T07:35:00.000Z	delire	gach	go to alsa-project.org and check in the card database to ensure it is supported.
2005-09-27T07:35:00.000Z	delire	gach	'play /path/to/a/sound.wav' doesn't work?
