2006-05-01T10:57:00.000Z	daddius		gtk program lang is c
2006-05-01T10:59:00.000Z	sethk	daddius	emacs has the best indenting of any editor
2006-05-01T10:59:00.000Z	sethk	daddius	it has totally configurable smart indenting for dozens of languages
2006-05-01T10:59:00.000Z	daddius	sethk	it indents true..  but out of the box it doesn't indent.. also i got it to indent with c++ but now i can't indent with perl. :-(
2006-05-01T11:00:00.000Z	sethk	daddius	it has c++, c, perl, java, out of the box
2006-05-01T11:00:00.000Z	sethk	daddius	you just need to say M-x perl-mode
2006-05-01T11:01:00.000Z	daddius	sethk	mmmmm M-x perl-mode?   now is that the meta key?
2006-05-01T11:01:00.000Z	sethk	daddius	esc-x  or alt-x
2006-05-01T11:02:00.000Z	daddius	sethk	I solute you ... I can see all the perl modes... now if I could only get this working
2006-05-01T11:03:00.000Z	sethk	daddius	sure you can
2006-05-01T11:03:00.000Z	sethk	daddius	I do it all the time
2006-05-01T11:03:00.000Z	sethk	daddius	I use the same .ssh directory in cygwin and ubuntu
2006-05-01T11:06:00.000Z	sethk	daddius	I don't know, but I have password-less login from ubunto to fedora, to slackware, to other ubuntu of course
2006-05-01T11:06:00.000Z	sethk	daddius	and logging into ubuntu from slackware and fedora and cygwin
2006-05-01T11:07:00.000Z	daddius	sethk	i can login fine.. the thing is I would like to fire up emacs..
2006-05-01T11:07:00.000Z	daddius	sethk	I really need to work on getting a passwdless access
2006-05-01T11:08:00.000Z	sethk	daddius	are you using ssh with -X ?
2006-05-01T11:09:00.000Z	daddius	sethk	yes ssh -X
2006-05-01T11:09:00.000Z	sethk	daddius	I run emacs on all my boxes
2006-05-01T11:09:00.000Z	sethk	daddius	you must have a configuration parameter not quite right
2006-05-01T11:10:00.000Z	daddius	sethk	i am thinking it must be that
