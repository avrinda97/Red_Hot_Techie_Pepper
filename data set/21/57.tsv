2012-10-27T23:47:00.000Z	quest98123923	escott	i found the problem
2012-10-27T23:47:00.000Z	escott	quest98123923	yeah?
2012-10-27T23:48:00.000Z	quest98123923	escott	i googled around, not sure what i did but i wrote in the terminal:
2012-10-27T23:48:00.000Z	quest98123923	escott	fdisk -l
2012-10-27T23:48:00.000Z	quest98123923	escott	and dmraid -E -r /dev/sda
2012-10-27T23:48:00.000Z	escott	quest98123923	that doesnt do anything. its the same as parted -l
2012-10-27T23:48:00.000Z	escott	quest98123923	ahhhh dmraid
2012-10-27T23:48:00.000Z	escott	quest98123923	disable that in your bios
2012-10-27T23:48:00.000Z	quest98123923	escott	hope how can i do that?
2012-10-27T23:48:00.000Z	escott	quest98123923	thats fakeraid or software raid
2012-10-27T23:49:00.000Z	escott		!raid
2012-10-27T23:49:00.000Z	quest98123923		i get too confused about that, is it necessary to turn off_
2012-10-27T23:49:00.000Z	quest98123923		_
2012-10-27T23:50:00.000Z	escott	quest98123923	you dont want fake raid. make sure it is turned off in your bios. it might be called "intel bios raid" but basically anything mentioning RAID should be turned off
2012-10-27T23:50:00.000Z	quest98123923		okay good to know
2012-10-27T23:50:00.000Z	quest98123923		i install this now and then i deal with that
2012-10-27T23:50:00.000Z	quest98123923		thanks a bunch
2012-10-27T23:50:00.000Z	escott	quest98123923	if you actually want RAID use mdadm
2012-10-27T23:51:00.000Z	quest98123923		dont wanna, got 1 hdd only
2012-10-27T23:51:00.000Z	escott	quest98123923	then there really is no point to having any kind of raid at all
2012-10-27T23:51:00.000Z	quest98123923	escott	yeah thought so too
