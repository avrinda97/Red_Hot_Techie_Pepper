2005-10-13T14:37:00.000Z	gasher		keyboard layout
2005-10-13T14:37:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	can you be  a bit more specific?
2005-10-13T14:38:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	you should have one of those.  Next question.
2005-10-13T14:39:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	    System/Preferences/Keyboard
2005-10-13T14:40:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	do you understand?
2005-10-13T14:43:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	are you running gnome?
2005-10-13T14:46:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	I am sorry, but I don't understand that.
2005-10-13T14:48:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	yes, you should change the keyboard preferences.  Did you see where I showed you where to do that?
2005-10-13T14:49:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	at the top of your screen, there is a System menu.  Pull that down and select Preferences.  Choose Keyboard in that list.  A program will start and you want the Layout tab.
2005-10-13T14:51:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	what problem do you see?  Did the keyboard mappings change at all?
2005-10-13T14:55:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	so in the Keyboard preferences, you don't see Belgian as a choice.  Correct?   Did you press the Add button?
2005-10-13T15:12:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	when you look at the layout tab under Keyboard preferences, is there a check next to the Belgian keyboard layout?
2005-10-13T15:14:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	you need to check it.
2005-10-13T15:17:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	That is a quick reboot.  If you bring up the preference now, does it show as checked?  I want to see if the change took.
2005-10-13T15:20:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	Idon't know what else to suggest.  Are you running Ubunto or kubuntu?  Or to put it another way, are you using gnome or kde?
2005-10-13T15:21:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	you rebooted after you set the flag on, didn't you?  If so, you don't need  to do it again.
2005-10-13T15:23:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	 Are you running Ubuntu or kubuntu(or xubuntu, maybe)?  Or to put it another way, are you using gnome or kde?
2005-10-13T15:33:00.000Z	Severian	gasher	 In help, there is a reference to a "Keyboard Layout Switcher" manual.  It might be good to look for that.  I am going to have to quit for the night, so I ban attend my Python group in the morning.
