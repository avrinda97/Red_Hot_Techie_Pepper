2011-10-13T00:23:00.000Z	mendota		opinions welcome: do you guys think a Ubuntu boot disk will have any more luck than an XP boot disk with a HDD problem that's throwing blue screens of death?
2011-10-13T00:24:00.000Z	undecim_	mendota	Neither one should be related to HDD problems
2011-10-13T00:25:00.000Z	undecim_	mendota	What problems are you having booting an XP disc?
2011-10-13T00:26:00.000Z	mendota	undecim_	well, i've got this vaio that's got no boot screen and it hangs after the XP disk tries to run its installation program
2011-10-13T00:26:00.000Z	mendota	undecim_	i get the feeling there might be more wrong than the HDD, but i'm willing to test a couple of avenues first.
2011-10-13T00:26:00.000Z	undecim_	mendota	At what point does it hang? Before it even loads the install part, or while the installation is running?
2011-10-13T00:27:00.000Z	mendota	undecim_	it gets most of its drivers set up
2011-10-13T00:27:00.000Z	mendota	undecim_	and then it stops with an error screen
2011-10-13T00:27:00.000Z	mendota	undecim_	claims i should run chkdsk on the hdd
2011-10-13T00:27:00.000Z	mendota	undecim_	let's see...should be in my search history...
2011-10-13T00:27:00.000Z	undecim_	mendota	Yeah, that sounds like a hardware issue
2011-10-13T00:28:00.000Z	mendota	undecim_	it's a stop code: "stop 0x0000007b"
2011-10-13T00:29:00.000Z	undecim_	mendota	Yeah. See if the Ubuntu CD gets anywhere
2011-10-13T00:29:00.000Z	mendota	undecim_	okay. i hope it works. it's this used/refurbish my dad picked up...so, i'm crossing all my fingers, lol
2011-10-13T00:31:00.000Z	undecim_	mendota	If it doesn't work, then try a new HDD. If that doesn't work, then it's the mobo, and that's generally more expensive than just selling off the working parts of the laptop and buying a newly refurbished one.
2011-10-13T00:31:00.000Z	mendota	undecim_	okay. that's good to know
2011-10-13T00:31:00.000Z	mendota	undecim_	i'm just avoiding the HDD replacement...because it's going to be a pain cracking that case
2011-10-13T00:32:00.000Z	mendota	undecim_	but there's 4 good gigs of laptop RAM i could salvage :D
2011-10-13T00:32:00.000Z	undecim_	mendota	Usually the HDD is 1-4 screws away... Is sony THAT bad at making things?
2011-10-13T00:33:00.000Z	mendota	undecim_	well, there's no obvious access
2011-10-13T00:33:00.000Z	mendota	undecim_	like my toshiba has two panels that you just open one screw for the primary/secondary hdd
