2005-07-20T09:46:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	oss is another api/backend, like alsa.
2005-07-20T09:46:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	esound runs on top of oss or alsa.
2005-07-20T09:47:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	jack, similar to esound in this layer hierarchy, runs on top of oss or alsa.
2005-07-20T09:47:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	you shouldn't need to change to oss from alsa unless it's an extreme case.
2005-07-20T09:48:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	so install jackd from universe, run it (read the documentation!), and run mixxx on top of jack
2005-07-20T09:48:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	afaik it does work with alsa directly, too
2005-07-20T09:50:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	esd is still running, probably
2005-07-20T09:51:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	err, for what?
2005-07-20T09:53:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	yes, gnome loads it by default.
2005-07-20T09:58:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	you need to: sudo modprobe snd_seq
2005-07-20T09:59:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	lsmod|grep ^snd_seq_oss
2005-07-20T10:00:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	doesn't matter
2005-07-27T09:29:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	do you have multiverse enabled?
2005-07-30T11:03:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	did you remove the firefox package?
2005-07-30T11:03:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	err, sorry
2005-11-18T10:34:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	see the topic
2005-12-30T09:56:00.000Z	crimsun	drcode	change the listening port in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
