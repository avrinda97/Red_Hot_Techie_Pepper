2004-12-26T12:47:00.000Z	crimsun	mrbrown	I presume you've installed all the needed packages to play DVDs?
2004-12-26T12:49:00.000Z	crimsun	mrbrown	did you install totem-xine from the 'universe' repository?
2004-12-26T12:50:00.000Z	crimsun	mrbrown	try it
2004-12-26T12:54:00.000Z	crimsun	mrbrown	you shouldn't have / be a read-only filesystem normally - that usually indicates errors in the filesystem.
2004-12-26T12:54:00.000Z	crimsun	mrbrown	look at the output of `mount'
2004-12-26T12:54:00.000Z	crimsun	mrbrown	if it says (ro,...), then there's a deeper issue
2004-12-26T12:56:00.000Z	crimsun	mrbrown	no, that's for the /dev/hdc "partition", which is your dvd-rom drive, which is normally (ro,...), so that's fine
2004-12-26T12:56:00.000Z	crimsun	mrbrown	I'm referring to your root partition, /
2004-12-26T12:58:00.000Z	crimsun	mrbrown	not really sure what the problem is...
2004-12-26T12:59:00.000Z	crimsun	mrbrown	are you saying no multimedia applications will play your dvd because /dev/dvd doesn't exist?
2004-12-26T12:59:00.000Z	crimsun	mrbrown	ls -l /dev/dvd
