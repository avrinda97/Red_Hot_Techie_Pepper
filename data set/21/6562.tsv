2007-03-09T12:58:00.000Z	joe4444		so mp3 DEcoders are illegal?
2007-03-09T12:59:00.000Z	t35t0r	joe4444	yes if unlicensed
2007-03-09T13:00:00.000Z	joe4444	t35t0r	see my q?
2007-03-09T13:00:00.000Z	t35t0r	joe4444	they don't know the licensing laws
2007-03-09T13:00:00.000Z	t35t0r	joe4444	there are lots of free ones for nix too
2007-03-09T13:01:00.000Z	joe4444	t35t0r	winamp is huge... surely someone would shut them down if it's illegal... what i don't get is if there are free ones for linux why can't they be included (or at least hosted on an official repo) in linux distros?
2007-03-09T13:02:00.000Z	t35t0r	joe4444	winamp is not free ...
2007-03-09T13:02:00.000Z	t35t0r	joe4444	they are ..use gentoo
2007-03-09T13:02:00.000Z	joe4444	t35t0r	there is a free version
2007-03-09T13:02:00.000Z	t35t0r	joe4444	or any other distro that doesn't care about patents
2007-03-09T13:02:00.000Z	joe4444	t35t0r	i've been using winamp for years... since before there was ever a "pay" version
2007-03-09T13:03:00.000Z	t35t0r	joe4444	the patent holders didn't start flexing their muscles until later
2007-03-09T13:03:00.000Z	joe4444	t35t0r	i'm just trying to understand the situation... i know there is winamp "pro" now, but you can still get the free one that plays mp3s but doesn't burn cds... it even plays lots of video formats
2007-03-09T13:04:00.000Z	t35t0r	joe4444	so ..you don't think nullsoft/aol pays licensing fees?
2007-03-09T13:04:00.000Z	joe4444	t35t0r	well for years it was 100% free
2007-03-09T13:05:00.000Z	joe4444	t35t0r	did they only have to start paying for a license when they added the "pro" version for a price?
2007-03-09T13:05:00.000Z	t35t0r	joe4444	no ..when they saw that they had a large enough user base and that everyone else was making money off of online music
2007-03-09T13:06:00.000Z	joe4444	t35t0r	so it just happened when fraunhofer (or whatever) decided to take action?
2007-03-09T13:06:00.000Z	t35t0r	joe4444	yes
2007-03-09T13:13:00.000Z	t35t0r	joe4444	that's a feature of the driver not ubuntu
2007-03-09T13:14:00.000Z	joe4444	t35t0r	so i definitely need to find a new driver?
