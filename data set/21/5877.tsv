2007-08-26T11:45:00.000Z	wib		hi, i downloaded the latest java runtime environment (the bin-file) and i believe i installed it, but "java -version" still returns the old version number
2007-08-26T11:47:00.000Z	wib		do i have to reboot after installing a new java verison?
2007-08-26T11:47:00.000Z	bruenig	wib	no
2007-08-26T11:47:00.000Z	bruenig	wib	reboot only if you are booting into a new kernel
2007-08-26T11:48:00.000Z	wib	bruenig	then how do i upgrade the java re? i ran the bin-file from the sun website
2007-08-26T11:48:00.000Z	bruenig	wib	did you have jre installed previous?
2007-08-26T11:49:00.000Z	wib	bruenig	yes, the package that comes with ubuntu
2007-08-26T11:49:00.000Z	bruenig	wib	did you uninstall it before installing the other one?
2007-08-26T11:50:00.000Z	wib	bruenig	no. sounds reasonable, though :)
2007-08-26T11:50:00.000Z	bruenig	wib	yeah that could be very messy now
2007-08-26T11:51:00.000Z	wib	bruenig	its not in the same directory
2007-08-26T11:51:00.000Z	bruenig	wib	well that's good then, I imagine that there is a file in /etc/profile.d that sets certain java variables, you would need to replace that obviously
2007-08-26T11:52:00.000Z	wib	bruenig	alright. how come ubuntu comes with such an old version of java, anyway?
2007-08-26T11:52:00.000Z	bruenig	wib	um java 6?
2007-08-26T11:53:00.000Z	wib	bruenig	java -version: "1.4.2"
2007-08-26T11:55:00.000Z	wib	bruenig	uh oh... i am missing something here...
2007-11-26T22:56:00.000Z	bruenig	wib	it wants to remove those because those things probably depend on the package you are trying to remove, if you want those packages to even be usable, you better keep that dependency
2007-11-26T22:57:00.000Z	wib	bruenig	bullgard4: it's a lirc library for remote controls. i want to cleanly install lirc from source...
2007-11-26T22:57:00.000Z	bruenig	wib	compile it and install it on top of the lirc package
2007-11-26T22:57:00.000Z	wib	bruenig	ok thx
2007-11-26T22:57:00.000Z	bruenig	wib	you wan't the package management to know you have lirc installed
