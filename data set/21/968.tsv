2011-04-12T06:12:00.000Z	Bite		Hi guys, i sudo apt-get autoremoved kubuntu, but the xserver login screen for it is still there and is complaining about letting me log in.
2011-04-12T06:12:00.000Z	Bite		I want to take care of this. What's the syntax for removed the xserver login for kubuntu?
2011-04-12T06:14:00.000Z	milamber	Bite	how did you install it, package kubuntu-desktop?
2011-04-12T06:15:00.000Z	Bite	milamber	yeah.
2011-04-12T06:15:00.000Z	milamber	Bite	kubuntu-desktop is what is known as a meta-package, it is difficult to uninstall
2011-04-12T06:16:00.000Z	milamber	Bite	it installs a lot of other packages
2011-04-12T06:16:00.000Z	Bite	milamber	>:V
2011-04-12T06:16:00.000Z	milamber	Bite	not impossible: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/puregnome
2011-04-12T06:16:00.000Z	Bite	milamber	is there a package name that installs strictly the desktop?
2011-04-12T06:17:00.000Z	Bite	milamber	thank you so much.
2011-04-12T06:18:00.000Z	milamber	Bite	read through the package list and make sure you aren't removing anything you want.
2011-04-12T06:18:00.000Z	Bite	milamber	i'm having issues logging in :V looks like i either have to input it manually or get rid of XServer.
2011-04-12T06:19:00.000Z	Bite		Milamber: Do you know how to remove the xserverlogin specifically? it's causing issues, if i can get that out from a command line i should be set.
2011-04-12T06:19:00.000Z	Bite		Milamber: and I know that cntrl+alt+f1+6 takes you to command line; is there a way to do the opposite?
2011-04-12T06:20:00.000Z	milamber	Bite	ctrl + alt + F7
2011-04-12T06:20:00.000Z	Bite		Milamber: thanks. Do you know the name of the package that's the login screen of kubuntu specifically?
2011-04-12T06:21:00.000Z	milamber	Bite	i believe it is kdm, just like gnome is gdm
2011-04-12T06:21:00.000Z	Bite		Milamber: also: the page you linked me to has it set up so that it uninstalls everything in kubuntu and then reinstalls gnome.
2011-04-12T06:21:00.000Z	Bite		Milamber: What exactly is contained in KDM? or GDM?
2011-04-12T06:22:00.000Z	milamber	Bite	http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/gdm   and to not install/reinstall gnome just remove the && install ubuntu-desktop
2011-04-12T06:24:00.000Z	Bite	milamber	doesn't it just reinstall the gnome meta-package?
