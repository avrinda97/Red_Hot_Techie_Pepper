2010-11-15T08:00:00.000Z	Fapton_Calcon		Does anyone know how to require a password to read and edit the .bash_history file?
2010-11-15T08:00:00.000Z	mngrif	Fapton_Calcon	you can use setattr (i think) to make the file append only
2010-11-15T08:01:00.000Z	Fapton_Calcon	mngrif	Can you explain further?
2010-11-15T08:02:00.000Z	mngrif	Fapton_Calcon	the attribute makes it so the file can't be edited or deleted or altered, except by appending more data to it. it requires root to change the attribute. it would help if you explained why you want it password protected
2010-11-15T08:03:00.000Z	Fapton_Calcon	mngrif	I wish for it to password protected as I may accidentally type my sudo password in plain text
2010-11-15T08:04:00.000Z	mngrif	Fapton_Calcon	... that's a pretty horrible reason to go through the extreme trouble of protecting it
2010-11-15T08:04:00.000Z	Fapton_Calcon	mngrif	What other solutions do I have?
2010-11-15T08:05:00.000Z	mngrif	Fapton_Calcon	because that's what it is, a LOT of trouble to go through. it's far better to just simply not type your password on the commandline :)
2010-11-15T08:05:00.000Z	mngrif	Fapton_Calcon	if you're under the impression that the password prompt from sudo saves your password, you're mistaken. it does not.
2010-11-15T08:05:00.000Z	Fapton_Calcon	mngrif	I agree, but it does happen occasionally by accident
2010-11-15T08:07:00.000Z	mngrif	Fapton_Calcon	then rm ~/.bash_history if it happens. your only other feasible option is to encrypt your home directory
2010-11-15T08:07:00.000Z	Fapton_Calcon	mngrif	I know it doesn't save my password, but that's if you input it at the right time XD
2010-11-15T08:07:00.000Z	mngrif	Fapton_Calcon	do other people use the computer in question?
2010-11-15T08:08:00.000Z	mngrif	Fapton_Calcon	as in, do they remotely log in and don't have physical access?
2010-11-15T08:08:00.000Z	Fapton_Calcon	mngrif	Thank you, haha. And no, no one else uses my computer. I'm just paranoid.
2010-11-15T08:08:00.000Z	mngrif	Fapton_Calcon	then yeah, you're wasting your time. nobody can get to that file without already being root..
2010-11-15T08:09:00.000Z	Fapton_Calcon	mngrif	I'm not root, but I can access it :|
2010-11-15T08:09:00.000Z	mngrif	Fapton_Calcon	because you own it.
2010-11-15T08:10:00.000Z	Fapton_Calcon	mngrif	I have a lot to learn. Thank you, though :)
2010-11-15T08:10:00.000Z	mngrif	Fapton_Calcon	no problem. now go learn about RAID recovery and then you can help me :D
2010-11-15T08:11:00.000Z	Fapton_Calcon	mngrif	Will do! Bye, and thanks again!
