2010-05-28T14:28:00.000Z	SauLus		I lost an openoffice file today. Its corrupted, nothing in there. I need to get it back!!
2010-05-28T14:28:00.000Z	SauLus		I had a look at ~/.openoffice.org/3/user/backup/ but its empty.
2010-05-28T14:29:00.000Z	SauLus		I think I have to grep through my ext4 file system. Is there any chance that I can get my file back?
2010-05-28T14:29:00.000Z	oCean_	SauLus	why you say it is corrupted? Or was that the message at startup?
2010-05-28T14:30:00.000Z	SauLus	oCean_	it was the message at startup
2010-05-28T14:31:00.000Z	oCean_	SauLus	that sounds bad
2010-05-28T14:32:00.000Z	oCean_	SauLus	and you can not find it anywhere?
2010-05-28T14:36:00.000Z	SauLus	oCean_	This file has been created yesterday. 10h of work. No backup, no other copy
2010-05-28T14:36:00.000Z	SauLus	oCean_	I wasnt finished. Wanted to make a backup right now - but the file is corrupted now. F**K!
2010-05-28T14:37:00.000Z	oCean_	SauLus	however annoying it is, (obfuscated) swearing is not allowed here. But at this point, you cannot find the file at all?
2010-05-28T14:42:00.000Z	SauLus	oCean_	I dont have the file at two places. The the file I am working at ~/myfile.odt is corrupted. There is no backupt. The openoffice backup directory is empty. file  ~/myfile.odt : OpenDocument Text.
2010-05-28T14:43:00.000Z	oCean_	SauLus	what you could try is: start oo writer, then Insert > File > myfile.odt
2010-05-28T14:45:00.000Z	SauLus	oCean_	"Due to an unexspected error, openoffice.org crahsed ...."
2010-05-28T14:47:00.000Z	oCean_	SauLus	now, that's nasty.
2010-05-28T14:55:00.000Z	oCean_	SauLus	any luck yet? Thought of one other possibility, that is opening the corrupted file using an other wordprocessor: "sudo apt-get install abiword" and try opening the document using abiword. Just a tip: while searching for solution, why not make a backupcopy op the (corrupted) doc?
2010-05-28T15:00:00.000Z	SauLus	oCean_	thats a nice try, but abiword only reads "PK????????§D¼<^Æ2" The file size of my broken file is 33K and that should be ok.
2010-05-28T15:00:00.000Z	oCean_	SauLus	getting out of options here :(
2010-05-28T15:07:00.000Z	oCean_	SauLus	you checked your ~/.openoffice/3/user/backup directory, right? Also checked in "temp" instead of backup?
2010-05-28T15:08:00.000Z	oCean_	SauLus	yay!
2010-05-28T15:08:00.000Z	SauLus	oCean_	the stupid thing is that openoffice does not create backups by default.
2010-05-28T15:08:00.000Z	oCean_	SauLus	be sure to enable the backups :)
