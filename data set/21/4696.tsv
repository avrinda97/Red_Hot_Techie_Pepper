2008-07-18T22:04:00.000Z	paolo	legend2440	the second hack didn't really work for me
2008-07-18T22:04:00.000Z	paolo	legend2440	let me try the first one
2008-07-18T22:08:00.000Z	paolo	legend2440	it looks like it is a bug... but I wonder why it has not been fixed yet
2008-07-18T22:08:00.000Z	legend2440	paolo	what is it set to   96?
2008-07-18T22:09:00.000Z	paolo	legend2440	  resolution:    129x127 dots per inch
2008-07-18T22:09:00.000Z	paolo	legend2440	fonts are too small
2008-07-18T22:10:00.000Z	legend2440	paolo	how do you find out   129 x 127?
2008-07-18T22:10:00.000Z	paolo	legend2440	xdpyinfo|grep resolution
2008-07-18T22:11:00.000Z	legend2440	paolo	  mine says     resolution:    77x76 dots per inch
2008-07-18T22:12:00.000Z	legend2440	paolo	and my fonts are 96
2008-07-18T22:12:00.000Z	paolo	legend2440	yes, that is surely much more readable than mine
2008-07-18T22:12:00.000Z	paolo	legend2440	I wonder how I can change it
2008-07-18T22:13:00.000Z	legend2440	paolo	fonts can be changed in System>Pref>appearance
2008-07-18T22:13:00.000Z	paolo	legend2440	that is only for gnome
2008-07-18T22:14:00.000Z	paolo	legend2440	I want to change the dpi settings
2008-07-18T22:14:00.000Z	paolo	legend2440	for X
2008-07-18T22:14:00.000Z	legend2440	paolo	oh ok yes i'm using gnome
2008-07-18T22:15:00.000Z	paolo	legend2440	I am not..
2008-07-18T22:16:00.000Z	legend2440	paolo	what are you using?
2008-07-18T22:16:00.000Z	paolo	legend2440	kde at the moment. But that is not the point. I don't want it to work only for kde stuff...
