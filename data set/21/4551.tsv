2008-04-03T05:24:00.000Z	sumalr	Teoz	go to sshd_config
2008-04-03T05:24:00.000Z	sumalr	Teoz	wait one moment
2008-04-03T05:24:00.000Z	sumalr	Teoz	modify the host's openssh daemon config file (sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config)
2008-04-03T05:24:00.000Z	sumalr	Teoz	Then change port 22 to Port XXXXX
2008-04-03T05:25:00.000Z	Teoz	sumalr	ok wait, i am doing this over SSH since my samba is headless
2008-04-03T05:25:00.000Z	sumalr	Teoz	Okay
2008-04-03T05:26:00.000Z	Teoz	sumalr	how high do ports go ? whats the last one ?
2008-04-03T05:28:00.000Z	sumalr	Teoz	I'm not sure though you can use anything up to 60000
2008-04-03T05:28:00.000Z	sumalr	Teoz	Lots of options there
2008-04-03T05:28:00.000Z	Teoz	sumalr	I'll have to get out my lucky numers now
2008-04-03T05:28:00.000Z	sumalr	Teoz	make you write it down so you won't get locked out
2008-04-03T05:30:00.000Z	Teoz	sumalr	all right ! the port is 13211 now
2008-04-03T05:31:00.000Z	sumalr	Teoz	I recommend this documentation to enhance your SSH security: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AdvancedOpenSSH
2008-04-03T05:31:00.000Z	Teoz	sumalr	damn it ! now it the connection is just refused even though I didnt screw up writing the port down
2008-04-03T05:31:00.000Z	sumalr	Teoz	did you tweak any other settings?
2008-04-03T05:32:00.000Z	Teoz	sumalr	no really, just that
2008-04-03T05:32:00.000Z	Teoz	sumalr	gladly, i also have samba running
2008-04-03T05:33:00.000Z	sumalr	Teoz	use netstat to see whether the port is open
2008-04-03T05:33:00.000Z	Teoz	sumalr	but that doesnt help me since I dont have access to /etc/
2008-04-03T05:36:00.000Z	sumalr	Teoz	also try netstat -an |find /i "listening"
2008-04-03T05:37:00.000Z	Teoz	sumalr	thatsweird, netstat doesnt even list my open samba
