2005-07-30T15:44:00.000Z	aspro		through synaptic?
2005-07-30T15:45:00.000Z	wijnand	aspro	you asking me?
2005-07-30T15:45:00.000Z	aspro		nah sorry :)
2005-07-30T15:45:00.000Z	aspro		thinking outloud
2005-07-30T15:45:00.000Z	wijnand		pity :)
2005-07-30T15:46:00.000Z	aspro	wijnand	it does seem risky, i wouldnt do it :)
2005-07-30T15:47:00.000Z	aspro	wijnand	perhaps just use the tarball?
2005-07-30T15:47:00.000Z	wijnand	aspro	yeah i was afraid of that, even though libc6 is bound to be backward compatible
2005-07-30T15:48:00.000Z	wijnand	aspro	could do that, but either that requires the same libc6 upgrade, or the repository's version doesn't require it either
2005-07-30T15:48:00.000Z	aspro		if your getting from breezy it probably just wants the latest
2005-07-30T15:48:00.000Z	aspro		doesnt need it, i ran acro7 form hoary
2005-07-30T15:49:00.000Z	wijnand	aspro	you used the tarball from adobe's site?
2005-07-30T15:49:00.000Z	aspro	wijnand	yep
2005-07-30T15:50:00.000Z	wijnand		alright then :)
