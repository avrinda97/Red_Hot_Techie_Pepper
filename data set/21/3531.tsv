2008-12-22T21:52:00.000Z	Gnea	onetinsoldier	tiyowan, thebloggu: I was thinking step 5) would be sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2008-12-22T21:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Gnea	have you done that before? it's like, yuk!
2008-12-22T21:53:00.000Z	Gnea	onetinsoldier	yeah, it's pretty minimalistic... it works sometimes
2008-12-22T21:54:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Gnea	this way it's done by the Xorg guys, and has worked quickly and nicely for a few guys. it doesn't always work out tho.
2008-12-22T21:55:00.000Z	Gnea	onetinsoldier	well, just in case it doesn't work, we've got bases covered
2008-12-22T21:55:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Gnea	roger that
2008-12-22T21:57:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Gnea	anyway, that command usually creates a pretty full xorg.conf file
2008-12-22T22:07:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Gnea	and tiyowan and thebloggu: there is a hit on bugs.launchpad.net...  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/265035
2008-12-22T22:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Gnea	and tiyowan and thebloggu: looks like it might be an ABI problem and an as yet unsolved bug for this other guy that had the issue
2008-12-22T22:09:00.000Z	Gnea	onetinsoldier	nice call
2008-12-22T22:10:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Gnea	thanks. but i didn't read the bug thread too closely. take a look if you haven't yet
2008-12-22T22:10:00.000Z	Gnea	onetinsoldier	k
2008-12-24T01:41:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Gnea	i've only installed a few themes so far. all but one has shown up for me and worked so far
2008-12-24T01:43:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Gnea	yes. i had one that i had to... unpack... configure it.. then repack it
2008-12-24T01:43:00.000Z	Gnea	onetinsoldier	that won't do. they need to be configured correctly from the start.
2008-12-24T01:45:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Gnea	it's the way the theme was made to be installed tho.. the theme has quite a number of different options... so you configure the options to the way you like, then repack it. that was explained before even downloading it
2009-01-02T02:35:00.000Z	Gnea	onetinsoldier	that's pretty odd that a root account can't make directories...
2009-01-02T02:36:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Gnea	yeah.. i don't get it, yet.
2009-01-02T02:36:00.000Z	Gnea	onetinsoldier	what program is it?
2009-01-02T02:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Gnea	take your pick, everything i have tried.. the latest pidgin, nmap-4.76, and a few others. the one i am trying right now is... glsof-0.10.0-pre-alpha4.
