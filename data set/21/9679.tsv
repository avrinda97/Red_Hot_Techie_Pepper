2005-08-02T06:59:00.000Z	bob2	ZibiKebir	then get rid of the junk you downloaded
2005-08-02T06:59:00.000Z	bob2	ZibiKebir	remove all that junk, ubuntu includes the driver already
2005-08-02T07:02:00.000Z	bob2	ZibiKebir	uninstall all the junk you just installed, them come back
2005-08-02T07:03:00.000Z	bob2	ZibiKebir	then 'sudo modprobe prism2_usb prism2_doreset=1'
2005-08-02T07:05:00.000Z	bob2	ZibiKebir	so when you said you had removed it, you were lying?
2005-08-02T07:06:00.000Z	bob2	ZibiKebir	so, lying to people helping you is incredibly useless
2005-08-02T07:10:00.000Z	bob2	ZibiKebir	then install linux-wlan-ng
2005-08-02T07:10:00.000Z	bob2	ZibiKebir	then 'sudo wlanctl-ng wlan0 lnxreq_autojoin ssid="SSID" authtype=opensystem'
