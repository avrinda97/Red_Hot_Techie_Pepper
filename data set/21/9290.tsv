2010-03-09T05:58:00.000Z	airtonix	ilovethislinuxst	you'll also want to turn off join/part messages for this channel. assuming you're using xchat then you right click on the channel name in the channel list (which is either tabs at the bottom or a list of channels on the left) and click 'join/part messages'
2010-03-09T05:59:00.000Z	airtonix	ilovethislinuxst	is english your primary language ?
2010-03-09T05:59:00.000Z	airtonix	ilovethislinuxst	then whats the problem ?
2010-03-09T05:59:00.000Z	airtonix	ilovethislinuxst	im pretty sure you've been spending most of the time ignoring peoples suggestions
2010-03-09T06:00:00.000Z	airtonix	ilovethislinuxst	then stop winding yourself up
2010-03-09T06:01:00.000Z	airtonix	ilovethislinuxst	first thing you need to do is make this channel move slower... you do that by removing the unnessecary messages which are the peoples joining and leaving.

2010-03-09T06:01:00.000Z	airtonix	ilovethislinuxst	to computers in general ?
2010-03-09T06:02:00.000Z	airtonix	ilovethislinuxst	and irc and the internet ?
2010-03-09T06:10:00.000Z	airtonix	ilovethislinuxst	you should be using xchat for this to be honest
2010-03-09T06:11:00.000Z	airtonix	ilovethislinuxst	and you will probably have issues playing dvds untill you enable the decss driver
