2006-10-03T10:48:00.000Z	gean		i really cannot bring Ubuntu on the HD... CD-ROM detection fails desperately... Cann i install from HD or usb-disk?
2006-10-03T10:50:00.000Z	THX-1138	gean	- There are some howots out there for it. - i don't have a link sry
2006-10-06T05:51:00.000Z	THX-1138	gean	- feeling adventurous?  ide=nodma
2006-10-06T05:52:00.000Z	THX-1138	gean	- You *might* be able to use that as a cheatcode on the alternate cd install
2006-10-06T05:53:00.000Z	THX-1138	gean	nvm
2006-10-06T05:53:00.000Z	gean	THX-1138	yes and failsafe and all other options ii thought could stay in
2006-10-06T05:54:00.000Z	THX-1138	gean	- The suspense is just killing me. - What make and model computer are you using?
2006-10-06T05:57:00.000Z	gean	THX-1138	is there any chance to install from the own harddisk?
2006-10-06T05:57:00.000Z	THX-1138	gean	- yes, butyou will need some time to do it. kind of challenging.
2006-10-06T05:59:00.000Z	THX-1138	gean	- What Operating system does it normally run. - it;s easier if you can make it run linux (more options)
2006-10-06T06:00:00.000Z	gean	THX-1138	now there is only Wind* on hda1 and some recovery on hda2. i have partitioned hda3 to install. i can put there Knoppix for a short time with no problem.
2006-10-06T06:00:00.000Z	THX-1138	gean	cpk2 - has it exactly
2006-10-06T06:03:00.000Z	THX-1138	gean	- if you have a net connection with linux (knoppix) or can boot from a floppy for debian style  net install - easiest might be to make a bootable usb key (prays your machine will boot from usb) you might change the recipe for usb key to copy iso image to the hard drive or tell knoppix to boot from an iso image copied to hard drive with "dd"
2006-10-06T06:04:00.000Z	gean	THX-1138	no floppy
2006-10-06T06:06:00.000Z	gean	THX-1138	i've also tried to install from my 2GB flash. initrd put there, copied all ubuntu-alternate, moved files from install to ./.. and changes scripts. BUT: my primitive bios didn't want to boot from it!
2006-10-06T06:06:00.000Z	THX-1138	gean	- That was my next "hail mary" guess
2006-10-06T06:07:00.000Z	THX-1138	gean	- Ask Seveas, Amaranth or possibly cafuego if you see them. maybe ask again in #debian or #hardware.
2006-10-06T06:10:00.000Z	gean	THX-1138	cpk2: THANKS FOR HINTS! I think, that especially for my situation there should be invented a tool. I'll try to do it! The idea is: Use Knoppix (since Debian does not tolerate the migration) to detect all hard and create the fstab for the machine, mount the partition, where Ubu' should come in, and ensure the kernel sits there. Grub too. Thenn reboot, and the install-CD sould be correctly detected and start^``recovery''
2006-10-06T06:11:00.000Z	THX-1138	gean	- sounds like a solid plan :)
2006-10-06T06:12:00.000Z	gean	THX-1138	there is such a tool, debootstrap, it goes but http:// .. It has many scripts implemented in it. i just have to check all $VARIABLES and specify file:/// instead..
2006-10-06T06:13:00.000Z	THX-1138	gean	- Yes, your machine would be something like an enterprise server. no disks
