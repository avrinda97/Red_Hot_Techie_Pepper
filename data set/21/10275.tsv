2005-04-16T08:59:00.000Z	whiskers	skreet	i installed from preview torrent file
2005-04-16T09:00:00.000Z	skreet	whiskers	Did you check to see if it was an option?
2005-04-16T09:01:00.000Z	whiskers	skreet	no everything was automatic
2005-04-16T09:01:00.000Z	skreet	whiskers	yes, but you *can* choose, probably.
2005-04-16T09:01:00.000Z	whiskers	skreet	i did not do anything...it just installed perfectly in about 30 minutes
2005-04-16T09:17:00.000Z	skreet	whiskers	a gentoo install is <200 MB
2005-04-16T09:17:00.000Z	skreet	whiskers	it's all the crap you add to it  :D
2005-04-16T09:18:00.000Z	whiskers	skreet	nope...i worked on it for almost a year...and it was about 80gigs
2005-04-16T09:18:00.000Z	skreet	whiskers	GentooLinux is very small post-install :D
2005-04-16T09:18:00.000Z	skreet	whiskers	 It did not magically become 80gb :D
2005-04-16T09:18:00.000Z	whiskers	skreet	that is just the beginning
