2006-07-16T08:07:00.000Z	Kennie		Hi my remote linux machine has trouble, it moutned read-only and fsck doesn't seem to work, any suggestions (Ubuntu 6.06) ?
2006-07-16T08:08:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	What access do you have to it?
2006-07-16T08:08:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	anything in a dmesg?
2006-07-16T08:09:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	The ordered stuff is fine
2006-07-16T08:10:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	anything else in the dmesg relating to the device ?

2006-07-16T08:14:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	That all looks good
2006-07-16T08:15:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	OK, if it is root then try a mount -o remount /
2006-07-16T08:15:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	But it really depends what went wrong, you can force a reboot by   echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger
2006-07-16T08:16:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	Ah well - it is difficult to read its mind
2006-07-16T08:16:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	Are all your partitions read only?
2006-07-16T08:16:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	Is it serial console you have to this box or what? Do you have bios access?
2006-07-16T08:17:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	wok?
2006-07-16T08:19:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	It's difficult to know - without figuring out why it read-only'd it its difficult to guess what will happen; since you are screwed at the moment I think I'd probably force the reobot and hope for the best - but it really wouldn't surprise me if it stopped during boot
2006-07-16T08:21:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	It normally read only mounts if there is a problem writing to the disc at some point
2006-07-16T08:23:00.000Z	Kennie	penguin42	: server still not getting up
2006-07-16T08:24:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	You killed it
2006-07-16T08:24:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	:-)
2006-07-16T08:24:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	better find someone near the reset button and the screen
2006-07-16T08:25:00.000Z	Kennie	penguin42	yeah but doesnt have to be fast, server was just up and not being used YET
2006-07-16T08:25:00.000Z	penguin42	Kennie	Ah - if it did a readonly then I'd give the disc a really good checkout before putting it into service
