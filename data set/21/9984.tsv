2005-06-20T11:06:00.000Z	Funraiser	reka	yes
2005-06-20T11:08:00.000Z	reka	Funraiser	i'm just trialling it atm.  i'd like to make a new partition but can't seem to be able to.  the new partition option is greyed out and there are padlocks next to the partition labels.  i assume this means i can't make changes.
2005-06-20T11:14:00.000Z	Funraiser	reka	if u select the partition the resize button doesn't appear?
2005-06-20T11:15:00.000Z	reka	Funraiser	no, if i tight-click, everything except unmount is greyed-out
2005-06-20T11:16:00.000Z	Funraiser	reka	how many hard drive do u have?
