2005-11-01T17:44:00.000Z	robotgeek	onkarshinde	create a session file in /etc/gdm/sessions . that way it shows up in your gdm login
2005-11-01T17:45:00.000Z	onkarshinde	robotgeek	I did. I used gnome.desktop from /etc/gdm/xsessions as template. But it doesn't show. Also please note that project looking glass needs that an X server is not running already.
2005-11-01T17:46:00.000Z	robotgeek	onkarshinde	yeah, but did you restart gdm with a 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart' ?
2005-11-01T17:47:00.000Z	onkarshinde	robotgeek	I restarted my machine. O:-)
2005-11-01T17:49:00.000Z	robotgeek	onkarshinde	okay, do this. http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3690 is the stuff u need to put in /etc/gdm/Sessions
2005-11-01T17:50:00.000Z	robotgeek	onkarshinde	btw, did you make the file executable with a chmod +x <file> ?
2005-11-01T17:50:00.000Z	onkarshinde	robotgeek	Which file?
2005-11-01T17:51:00.000Z	robotgeek	onkarshinde	for a 'session' to show up in the gdm login screen, you need to put the file in /etc/gdm/Sessions/<file with session name> <- this file needs to be executable.
2005-11-01T17:53:00.000Z	robotgeek	onkarshinde	the stuff to put in there is at http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3691
2005-11-01T17:55:00.000Z	onkarshinde	robotgeek	thanks.
2005-11-01T17:55:00.000Z	robotgeek	onkarshinde	cool
2005-11-01T17:57:00.000Z	onkarshinde	robotgeek	Can't try now. At office. Will have to try at home. Will let you know tomorrow.
2005-11-01T17:59:00.000Z	robotgeek	onkarshinde	ty, it should work though. it works for me :)
2005-11-01T06:00:00.000Z	onkarshinde	robotgeek	Have you tried it with Project Lokking Glass?
2005-11-01T06:00:00.000Z	robotgeek	onkarshinde	want to , but am not going to do it. my machine is pretty slow
2005-11-01T06:01:00.000Z	onkarshinde	robotgeek	will be back in some time.
2005-11-01T06:01:00.000Z	robotgeek	onkarshinde	looked at the screenies, pretty neat.
