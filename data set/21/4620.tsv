2008-05-03T06:59:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Ward1983	do you have a larger HD available, to ghost the image to?
2008-05-03T06:59:00.000Z	Ward1983	SeaPhor	i just have plenty of space on my new comp, and none on the old one, and the old one needs to be backupped
2008-05-03T07:00:00.000Z	Ward1983	SeaPhor	i have no HD i can put onto the old comp
2008-05-03T07:00:00.000Z	Ward1983	SeaPhor	i mean no extra
2008-05-03T07:02:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Ward1983	$20 will get you a IDE/SATA-to-USB device to mount a HD as an external if you just want to transfer files?
2008-05-03T07:02:00.000Z	Ward1983	SeaPhor	not needed, i have a network
2008-05-03T07:02:00.000Z	Ward1983	SeaPhor	if i cannot even backup my stuff over network in a none insane way im going back to windows
2008-05-03T07:03:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Ward1983	can you not see your shared directories thru the network?
2008-05-03T07:04:00.000Z	Ward1983	SeaPhor	correct
2008-05-03T07:04:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Ward1983	what file sys is the old hd?
2008-05-03T07:05:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Ward1983	well technically yes, but permissions do matter
2008-05-03T07:06:00.000Z	Ward1983	SeaPhor	how do you mean?
2008-05-03T07:07:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Ward1983	is there a router involved or thru a switch?
2008-05-03T07:08:00.000Z	Ward1983	SeaPhor	router but it has a built-in switch so its trough the switch, only
2008-05-03T07:09:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Ward1983	so the port is open and ,,, you can see the files ,,, ?
2008-05-03T07:09:00.000Z	Ward1983	SeaPhor	i cannot even see the new comp
2008-05-03T07:10:00.000Z	Ward1983	SeaPhor	yet i have a directory shared on it, and i added my comp to the hosts that are allowed to access it
2008-05-03T07:13:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Ward1983	ok, this is off the wall but,,, any possibility that old pc is infected and port is in use by a re-director? other than that i would have to see a netstat output from the old machine to begin,,,sorry, i'm not a guru, just good at end-resu;ts
2008-05-03T07:13:00.000Z	Ward1983	SeaPhor	no its not infected, i allways have this problem, with any PC
2008-05-03T07:15:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Ward1983	then I'm sorry bro, I tried what i know and "ain't gonna blow any smoke" i wish i could help
2008-05-03T07:15:00.000Z	Ward1983	SeaPhor	no problem
