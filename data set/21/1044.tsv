2011-03-05T04:40:00.000Z	Jasonn	gmachine_24	if you do that, your comp will get screwed up (wont boot), really depends what they are, but sometimes they are just updates of one Os, i would just leave it
2011-03-05T04:41:00.000Z	gmachine_24	Jasonn	yes, precisely they are just an update of one OS, or one version of Ubuntu.
2011-03-05T04:42:00.000Z	Jasonn	gmachine_24	the EXACT same thing happened to me yesterday, my comp stopped booting, and i had to reinstall os, DONT TOUCH THEM -
2011-03-05T04:43:00.000Z	Jasonn	gmachine_24	i dont know much about linux, but i also know that i was so determined to get rid of that to make it boot automatically without hitting enter, and then BOOM with a simple sudo -i && rm ***.tar.gz, my comp stopped bootiung
