2008-06-11T16:19:00.000Z	ReVoLveR	Jack_Sparrow	 thats the msg which came when I typed it.
2008-06-11T16:21:00.000Z	ReVoLveR	Jack_Sparrow	 it said compiz isn't installed, shall I install it too?
2008-06-11T16:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ReVoLveR	earlier you asked how to kill it, why ask how to kill it if it was not installed in the first place
2008-06-11T16:22:00.000Z	ReVoLveR	Jack_Sparrow	 I have no idea myself how this is happening :S
2008-06-11T16:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ReVoLveR	the problem you describe is common when there is an error in a window decorator.  Have you tried to install and window decorations, effects or how things look etc
2008-06-11T16:24:00.000Z	ReVoLveR	Jack_Sparrow	 I have tried everything which you said and still its not working
2008-06-11T16:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ReVoLveR	Please answer my last question
2008-06-11T16:25:00.000Z	ReVoLveR	Jack_Sparrow	 window decorators.. ummm I don't think I have
2008-06-11T16:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ReVoLveR	What have you installed since the base initial installation
2008-06-11T16:27:00.000Z	ReVoLveR	Jack_Sparrow	 I haven't updated or installed anything for like a week, but this happened today only
2008-06-11T16:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ReVoLveR	I did not ask how long it has been since you installed anything.  You seem to avoid answering direct questions
