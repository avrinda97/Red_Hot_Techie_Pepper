2012-01-04T06:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	Argorok	 'nomodeset' is often needed. untill you get the nvidia drivers installed.
2012-01-04T06:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	Argorok	 i often use 'nomodeset noquiet nosplash nofb'
2012-01-04T06:50:00.000Z	Argorok	dr_willis	I run into the same problem, as if I didn't changed the bootargs
2012-01-04T06:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	Argorok	 the 'text' option should get you to a console also. where you can install the ssh server, and nvidia drivers to make trobule shooting easier.
2012-01-04T06:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	Argorok	 the live-cd has a menu item (hit space where you see the man=keyboard image, then under F5 or F6 i recall)
2012-01-04T06:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	Argorok	 try nomodset noquiet nofb nosplash text
2012-01-04T06:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	Argorok	 ive never needed to mess with vga=XXX     Im not sure that sort of option even works these days
2012-01-04T06:56:00.000Z	Argorok	dr_willis	tryed... Same thing
2012-01-04T06:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	Argorok	 this isent one of those weird new laptops that have 2 video chipsets in them?
2012-01-04T06:57:00.000Z	Argorok	dr_willis	no, its a little old desktop with only offboard vga
2012-01-04T06:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	Argorok	 what chipset exactly?
2012-01-04T06:58:00.000Z	Argorok	dr_willis	don't remember, let me see on the motherboard datasheet
2012-01-04T06:59:00.000Z	Argorok	dr_willis	Intel 945 Express, Intel ICH7
2012-01-04T07:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	Argorok	 you are trying to install teh nvidia drivers when you just stated you had an intel chipset?
2012-01-04T07:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	Argorok	         | dr_willis, Intel 945 Express, Intel ICH7
2012-01-04T07:08:00.000Z	Argorok	dr_willis	this chipset doesn't have onboard vga
2012-01-04T07:08:00.000Z	Argorok	dr_willis	you asked my chipset, not my vga
2012-01-04T07:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	Argorok	 so you have BOTH then?
2012-01-04T07:09:00.000Z	Argorok	dr_willis	my mobo DONT have onboard vga, DONT have onboard gpu, this chipset DONT HAVE things about graphs
2012-01-04T07:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	Argorok	 so what nvidia card do you have?
2012-01-04T07:09:00.000Z	Argorok	dr_willis	then come here and show me the vga DB15 on back panel ¬¬
