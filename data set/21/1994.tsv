2010-03-19T03:25:00.000Z	jastor	Slart	;)
2010-03-19T03:03:00.000Z	Slart	jastor	running ubuntu?
2010-03-19T03:04:00.000Z	jastor	Slart	well . no matter what dist ;) shouldnt it work on either or the majority of them? :)
2010-03-19T03:04:00.000Z	Slart	jastor	I think you might be better off asking in ##linux
2010-03-19T03:05:00.000Z	Slart	jastor	ubuntu comes with the root password disabled and we don't support setting one
2010-03-19T03:05:00.000Z	jastor	Slart	i suppose :)
2010-03-19T03:05:00.000Z	Slart	jastor	but the procedure should be the same on most distros... I suppose
2010-03-19T03:06:00.000Z	jastor	Slart	besides .. ubuntu comes with the root password disabled? ;) not always
2010-03-19T03:07:00.000Z	Slart	jastor	oh? the official versions do.. afaik at least
2010-03-19T03:07:00.000Z	jastor	Slart	installing ubuntu server :) it asks if you want a "root user" .. or only allow antoher user to su to root
2010-03-19T03:07:00.000Z	Slart	jastor	I suppose I shouldn't ask if you're sure about that.. I must have missed that when I installed it
2010-03-19T03:07:00.000Z	jastor	Slart	the wording may be wrong .. but the first option anyway lets you login directly as root
2010-03-19T03:08:00.000Z	jastor	Slart	were the second option disables direct root login and sets so that oyu can only su to root in able to access root
2010-03-19T03:11:00.000Z	Slart	jastor	trying the server install now in virtualbox =)
2010-03-19T03:12:00.000Z	jastor	Slart	might have to enable "exprt mode" at boot (f6 or where it is)
2010-03-19T03:13:00.000Z	Slart	jastor	yup.. did that
2010-03-19T03:13:00.000Z	jastor	Slart	:)
2010-03-19T03:14:00.000Z	jastor	Slart	and the textbased installer (no idea if ubuntu server has a X/gui installer ;)
2010-03-19T03:14:00.000Z	Slart	jastor	if it has one I haven't seen it so far.. "install ubuntu" takes you to the text based install
2010-03-19T03:21:00.000Z	Slart	jastor	you were correct.. it asks if root will be allowed to login or not.. perhaps that's why we have #ubuntu-server ;)
