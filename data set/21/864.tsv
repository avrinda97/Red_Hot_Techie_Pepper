2011-05-04T04:47:00.000Z	geus	comthre3	you do have a static IP address?
2011-05-04T04:47:00.000Z	comthre3	geus	yes
2011-05-04T04:48:00.000Z	geus		ports forwarded on router? Firewalls? firestarter/ufw?
2011-05-04T04:48:00.000Z	comthre3	geus	all open, no firewall
2011-05-04T04:49:00.000Z	geus		tried alternate ports? 16881-16891 instead of 6881-6891
2011-05-04T04:49:00.000Z	comthre3	geus	hmmm,, nop didnt try that, let me give it a whire!
2011-05-04T04:49:00.000Z	comthre3		wait!!!
2011-05-04T04:49:00.000Z	comthre3		it started working now!!!!!!! when i ran it as sudo it started downloading!
2011-05-04T04:50:00.000Z	geus		hmm, that's ermm not good
2011-05-04T04:50:00.000Z	geus		shouldn't need root priviliges
2011-05-04T04:50:00.000Z	geus		probably will work as "normal" user now too
2011-05-04T04:50:00.000Z	comthre3	geus	i know,,, it was a hailmerry sorta thing and it worked.. let me check running as normal use
2011-05-04T04:52:00.000Z	comthre3	geus	im getting "Couldn't open "/home/com3/.config/transmission/lock": Permission denied"
2011-05-04T04:52:00.000Z	geus		try removing your config files as root and fire up as normal user afterwards then I'd guess
2011-05-04T04:53:00.000Z	geus		unless transmission is still running as root?
2011-05-04T04:53:00.000Z	geus		tray?
2011-05-04T05:00:00.000Z	comthre3	geus	guess what! it just decided to work out of the blue! but thanks for your help :)
2011-05-04T05:01:00.000Z	geus	comthre3	weird, sounded like your config files were owned by root but O.K. Cool I guess :)
2011-05-04T05:03:00.000Z	comthre3	geus	you know whats weirder? tranmission autostarts so it cannot be owned by root., that doesnt make any sense, but its working cant complain :)
2011-05-04T05:04:00.000Z	geus	comthre3	but if you start it from terminal it doesn't display any errors?
2011-05-04T05:06:00.000Z	comthre3	geus	nopm starts normally
