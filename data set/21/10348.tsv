2005-05-28T13:28:00.000Z	jasoncohen		transcode - Utility to encode raw video/audio streams
2005-05-28T13:28:00.000Z	jasoncohen		i don't really know what it's needed for. it's a build dep for mythdvd
2005-05-28T13:29:00.000Z	jasoncohen		actually, i only have hoary-extras
2005-05-28T13:29:00.000Z	jasoncohen		i don't have hoary-backports
2005-05-28T13:30:00.000Z	jasoncohen		what exactly is hoary-backports. it looks like it has new package versions
2005-05-28T13:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	jasoncohen	 you nailed it
2005-05-28T13:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	jasoncohen	 build-essential
2005-05-28T13:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	jasoncohen	 sudo apt-get build-dep foo
2005-05-28T13:47:00.000Z	jasoncohen	eyequeue	mythtv apparently doesn't have a source package so i can't
2005-05-28T13:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	jasoncohen	 ah, i hadn't seen which app
2005-05-28T13:50:00.000Z	eyequeue	jasoncohen	 also be aware you'll typically want the -dev versions of libraries to get your header files
2005-05-28T13:51:00.000Z	jasoncohen	eyequeue	yup, i know that too :)
2005-05-28T13:52:00.000Z	eyequeue	jasoncohen	 apt-cache search stringhere | less   can be your friend (curses for libncurses5w-dev)
2005-05-28T13:52:00.000Z	eyequeue	jasoncohen	 not the same, but try gaim-encryption
2005-05-28T13:53:00.000Z	eyequeue	jasoncohen	 i think -otr is slated for breezy
2005-05-28T13:54:00.000Z	eyequeue	jasoncohen	 agreed that pfs is a GoodThing
2005-05-28T14:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	jasoncohen	 kernel-* in debian, linux-* in ubuntu :)
2005-07-15T15:24:00.000Z	jasoncohen	eyequeue	you're quite welcome
2005-07-23T12:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	jasoncohen	 gotcha
2005-07-23T12:25:00.000Z	eyequeue	jasoncohen	 i recommend asking for it "bare" (all reputable shops around here do that)
2005-07-23T12:25:00.000Z	jasoncohen	eyequeue	i build my own boxes. i was just saying most people don't and therefore paid for windows
