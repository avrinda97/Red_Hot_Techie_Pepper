2006-06-08T14:52:00.000Z	troy_s		ar2no:  DONT
2006-06-08T14:52:00.000Z	troy_s		ar2no:  it is too insecure.
2006-06-08T14:53:00.000Z	troy_s		ar2no:  use ssh
2006-06-08T14:53:00.000Z	troy_s		ar2no:  it is worth noting that the ONLY remote hole in openbsd came in the ftpd server.  think about it.
2006-06-08T14:54:00.000Z	troy_s		ar2no:  ssh was intended to replace ALL of those insecure protocols -- telnet, ftp, etc.
2006-06-08T14:54:00.000Z	troy_s		ar2no:  please don't use ftp.  your insecurity is everyone's insecurity.

2006-06-08T14:55:00.000Z	Ar2No	troy_s	so what is the command to add ssh user? complete with his home directory? please help me abit..
2006-06-08T14:56:00.000Z	troy_s		ar2no:  ssh is simply based on your basic system.  add a user using adduser and you get ssh for free.
2006-06-08T14:57:00.000Z	troy_s		ar2no:  and you won't be subjecting all of the world to further exploitation via owned systems.
2006-06-08T14:57:00.000Z	Ar2No	troy_s	u mean like this sudo useradd troy_s
2006-06-08T14:58:00.000Z	troy_s		ar2no:  use the gnome user adder if you want
2006-06-08T14:58:00.000Z	troy_s		ar2no:  but man useradd is a good start as per intelikey
2006-06-08T14:58:00.000Z	troy_s	intelikey	 well said.
2006-06-08T14:58:00.000Z	Ar2No	troy_s	actually I dont have GUI on my server
