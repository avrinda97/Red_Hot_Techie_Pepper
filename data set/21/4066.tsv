2011-04-07T21:13:00.000Z	soreau	frybye	Its a device node, not a directory
2011-04-07T21:13:00.000Z	soreau	frybye	You have to mount it to a directory
2011-04-07T21:14:00.000Z	soreau	frybye	sudo mount /dev/sda2 /some/empty/directory
2011-04-07T21:14:00.000Z	soreau	frybye	Or, it may already be mounted. See the output of mount|grep sda2
2011-04-07T21:14:00.000Z	frybye	soreau	ok thanks...
2011-04-07T21:17:00.000Z	soreau	frybye	Yes
2011-04-07T21:17:00.000Z	frybye	soreau	the sub-dir names are like    My Vids - and ubuntu dosent seem to like them or..?
2011-04-07T21:18:00.000Z	soreau	frybye	Or you can escape them with \
2011-04-07T21:19:00.000Z	soreau	frybye	Use tab to auto complete the file names
2011-04-07T21:20:00.000Z	soreau	frybye	chmod +x /path/to/file.exe
2011-04-07T21:20:00.000Z	soreau	frybye	But that is a windows executable so you would need to run it with wine or so
2011-04-07T21:21:00.000Z	frybye	soreau	yeah .. but the path has a load of spaces in it too so is there not a way to do it within that directory without the path being stated in the command?
2011-04-07T21:22:00.000Z	soreau	frybye	wine /media/blah/blah/file\ with\ spaces<tab><tab>
2011-04-07T21:22:00.000Z	soreau	frybye	tab will autocomplete the name for you
2011-04-07T21:22:00.000Z	frybye	soreau	so if I am already IN the right directory cant I just do a chmod +x start.exe or..?
2011-04-07T21:23:00.000Z	soreau	frybye	. is the current working directory, so do chmod ./file.exe
2011-04-07T21:29:00.000Z	frybye	soreau	did you see that doing   sudo chmod ./start.exe   produced  missing operand after `./start.exe'
2011-04-07T21:29:00.000Z	soreau	frybye	You forgot +x
2011-04-07T21:29:00.000Z	soreau	frybye	+x makes it executable while =x does the opposite
2011-04-07T21:36:00.000Z	frybye	soreau	something went wrong - still gives a fault report that it is not exectuable...
2011-04-07T21:37:00.000Z	frybye	soreau	and when I use the gui it still auto deletes when I try and put the tick in allow execute... [ ]
