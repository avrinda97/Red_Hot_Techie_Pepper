2008-05-06T07:52:00.000Z	mstef		how do i get gnome to stop loading applications upon logging in? pidgin and amorak launch automatically
2008-05-06T07:53:00.000Z	gnufied	mstef	sessions
2008-05-06T07:53:00.000Z	mstef	gnufied	its unchecked
2008-05-06T07:53:00.000Z	mstef	gnufied	Krimpet , neither of those programs are listed for startup, and "remember application.." is unchecked
2008-05-06T07:54:00.000Z	gnufied	mstef	remove it, also remove them from current session, if they are there.
2008-05-06T07:54:00.000Z	mstef	gnufied	i just said they werent
2008-05-06T07:55:00.000Z	gnufied	mstef	okay, then are they there in ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession or something like that?
2008-05-06T07:55:00.000Z	gnufied	mstef	does it happen for a new user also?
2008-05-06T07:55:00.000Z	mstef	gnufied	only have one users..checking those files now
2008-05-06T07:56:00.000Z	mstef	gnufied	where are those files
2008-05-06T07:56:00.000Z	gnufied	mstef	if they are not there in your home directory then you are fine. post a screenshot of your sessions dialog window
2008-05-06T07:57:00.000Z	mstef	gnufied	the window that lists the startup programs?
2008-05-06T07:58:00.000Z	mstef	gnufied	the window that lists the startup programs? and where can i post/
2008-05-06T07:59:00.000Z	gnufied	mstef	imageshack, flickr
2008-05-06T08:00:00.000Z	mstef	gnufied	theres nothing to see in that dialog..only the regular basic apps are listed for startup
2008-05-06T08:01:00.000Z	gnufied	mstef	and under current session tab?
2008-05-06T08:01:00.000Z	mstef	gnufied	theres all my apps that are running now...which is a lot of them..don't see why that would impact the startup
2008-05-06T08:02:00.000Z	gnufied	mstef	because, some of those apps, will have property set that restart the program on new gnome-session, you need to disable that for amarok or whatever program you don't want to restart when gnome starts
2008-05-06T08:02:00.000Z	mstef	gnufied	ok ill look..thanks
2008-05-06T08:03:00.000Z	mstef	gnufied	amorak isn't even listed..and pidgin isn;t set to restart
2008-05-06T08:05:00.000Z	gnufied	mstef	something weird, add a new user and try. command is adduser gnufied
