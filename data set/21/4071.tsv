2011-02-27T23:55:00.000Z	KucukMubasir		hi again guys, I tried installing git on terminal, yet I got this error in return:
2011-02-27T23:55:00.000Z	KucukMubasir		Package git has no installation candidate
2011-02-27T23:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	KucukMubasir	is git-core
2011-02-27T23:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	KucukMubasir	no problem
2011-02-28T00:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	KucukMubasir	use ~/.profile
2011-02-28T00:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	KucukMubasir	bash reads it
2011-02-28T00:36:00.000Z	KucukMubasir	erUSUL	I need to paste a line of code to bash_profile file
2011-02-28T00:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	KucukMubasir	it is equivalent. paste it to ~/.profile
2011-02-28T00:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	KucukMubasir	yes
2011-02-28T00:43:00.000Z	KucukMubasir	erUSUL	I need to paste this line to bash_profile :[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"  # This loads RVM into a shell session.
2011-02-28T00:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	KucukMubasir	profile is only read on login
2011-02-28T00:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	KucukMubasir	log out and log in
2011-02-28T00:44:00.000Z	KucukMubasir	erUSUL	thanks
2011-02-28T01:14:00.000Z	KucukMubasir	erUSUL	, I log out and log in as you said
2011-02-28T01:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	KucukMubasir	well; i dunno what the file you are sourcing does or how are you checking if it does or not does anything ...
2011-02-28T01:17:00.000Z	KucukMubasir	erUSUL	I am applying for the instructions here: http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/

2011-02-28T01:31:00.000Z	KucukMubasir	erUSUL	what is the bashrc file?
2011-02-28T01:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	KucukMubasir	in you home. like ~/.profile ~/.bashrc
2011-02-28T01:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	KucukMubasir	both are using by bash. bashrc is read everytime bash startes profile only on login
