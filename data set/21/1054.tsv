2011-04-29T20:24:00.000Z	Osmodivs		Why can't I upgrade to 11.04 from terminal? I am typing the right commands: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2011-04-29T20:24:00.000Z	Osmodivs		Am i missig somethig?
2011-04-29T20:24:00.000Z	Osmodivs		Oh, thank you
2011-04-29T20:24:00.000Z	Osmodivs		my bad
2011-04-29T20:24:00.000Z	usr13	Osmodivs	sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2011-04-29T20:25:00.000Z	Osmodivs	usr13	They say that's NOT the right command
2011-04-29T20:25:00.000Z	usr13	Osmodivs	What command?
2011-04-29T20:26:00.000Z	Osmodivs	usr13	dist-upgrade, it's do-release-upgrade
2011-04-29T20:29:00.000Z	usr13	Osmodivs	Ok, well, they both prolly work still
2011-05-04T02:04:00.000Z	usr13	Osmodivs	Sure
2011-05-07T02:46:00.000Z	usr13	Osmodivs	There is a plugin for Firefox someplace, but I don't know the name of it.  Just look around.
2011-05-07T02:50:00.000Z	Osmodivs	usr13	Na, they tend to fail, it's a 600MB file, and it stoped at 90MB, i want something to download and try everytime there is a bad internet connection
2011-06-16T05:16:00.000Z	usr13	Osmodivs	Text editors use fonts and even though they are owned by root, they are still accessable.
2011-06-16T05:18:00.000Z	usr13	Osmodivs	I think you are barking up the wrong tree.  There is some other reason the fonts are not accessable.  You need to look at the information that was provided to you by ubottu
2011-06-16T05:21:00.000Z	usr13	Osmodivs	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Fonts
2011-08-30T06:47:00.000Z	usr13	Osmodivs	This may be off topic just a bit, but did you run checksum?
2011-08-30T06:47:00.000Z	Osmodivs	usr13	Nah, it didn't have any MD5sum on its web page
2011-08-30T06:48:00.000Z	usr13	Osmodivs	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes
2011-08-30T06:50:00.000Z	usr13	Osmodivs	I never burn a CD without verifying the integrity of the iso.
2011-08-30T06:51:00.000Z	Osmodivs	usr13	Since it is based on Ubuntu, is it ok to check the sum there? and if so, what version should i check?
2011-08-30T06:51:00.000Z	usr13	Osmodivs	There is a particular hash for each particular iso
