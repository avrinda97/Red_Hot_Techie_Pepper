2007-08-22T09:07:00.000Z	bruenig		ubuntu doesn't develop filesystem drivers
2007-08-22T09:07:00.000Z	bruenig		they only develop package management python front ends
2007-08-22T09:09:00.000Z	mannytu	bruenig	sudo -s password then you get the #
2007-08-22T09:09:00.000Z	bruenig	mannytu	that is not a root user
2007-08-22T09:09:00.000Z	bruenig	mannytu	/etc/sudoers has a permission problems, he can't therefore use sudo, he needs to be root to correct the sudoers permission problems
2007-08-22T09:11:00.000Z	bruenig	mannytu	are you high, he can't use sudo because /etc/sudoers got bad permissions, the only way to change them is as root which since the root account is locked, he can't do
2007-08-22T09:12:00.000Z	mannytu	bruenig	when I do it, i get the # which is the root i thought...
2007-08-22T09:12:00.000Z	bruenig	mannytu	no it isn't root
2007-08-22T09:24:00.000Z	bruenig	mannytu	do sudo echo $UID
2007-08-22T09:16:00.000Z	mannytu	bruenig	this is what I got...  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34615/
2007-08-22T09:17:00.000Z	bruenig	mannytu	you are not root
2007-08-22T09:17:00.000Z	bruenig	mannytu	it checks your UID, do "sudo whoami" from a normal console, you will get the same
2007-08-22T09:20:00.000Z	mannytu	bruenig	sudo whoami you are right, however, you do -s then you get the # not the $ and sudo is not needed anymore
2007-08-22T09:20:00.000Z	bruenig	mannytu	the # is dependent on UID
2007-08-22T09:23:00.000Z	bruenig	mannytu	it has to do with the PS1 variable set in the profile, if you use the following escape sequence in it which ubuntu does you get this, this is from the bash prompt docs: \$     if the effective UID is 0, a #, otherwise  a $
2007-08-22T09:24:00.000Z	bruenig	mannytu	you see it is 1000 which is 0
2007-08-22T09:24:00.000Z	mannytu	bruenig	I'm just checking it out
2007-08-22T09:25:00.000Z	bruenig	mannytu	you see the snippet says "effective UID"
2007-08-22T09:26:00.000Z	mannytu	bruenig	I'm reading what it says right-now
2007-08-25T11:12:00.000Z	mannytu	bruenig	never sleeps...
2007-08-25T15:04:00.000Z	mannytu	bruenig	Hello
