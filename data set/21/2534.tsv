2010-02-22T17:41:00.000Z	indus	meua	i tried it runs ok
2010-02-22T17:42:00.000Z	meua	indus	it runs ok for me too, but even with the console shutted down, the python's process keep consuming 100%... :(
2010-02-22T17:43:00.000Z	indus	meua	thats probably due to another process?
2010-02-22T17:43:00.000Z	indus	meua	chekc which process
2010-02-22T17:43:00.000Z	meua	indus	ok thanks fo your time !
2010-02-22T17:44:00.000Z	indus	meua	see any process with 100 %?
2010-02-22T17:45:00.000Z	meua	indus	i've stopped both python process and everything come back to normal (average 20%CPU)
2010-02-22T17:46:00.000Z	meua	indus	it might be my attempt to install eclipse and pydev plugin that started a undesirable process maybe...
2010-02-22T17:47:00.000Z	meua	indus	ok. Thanks once again !
2010-02-22T17:47:00.000Z	indus	meua	i just thought it was running some loop etc or doing some crazy maths
2010-02-22T17:47:00.000Z	meua	indus	nope i'm learning programming with a very basic tutorial... just this
2010-02-22T17:48:00.000Z	indus	meua	do try byteofpython.info
2010-02-22T17:48:00.000Z	meua	indus	i'm on this http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/ch03.html
