2005-04-22T16:39:00.000Z	kenny		hi guys
2005-04-22T16:39:00.000Z	kenny		i was wondering if anyone can help me please
2005-04-22T16:40:00.000Z	kenny		I can seem to get my Windows HDD drives to show, i can mount them and access them but when i click on places and computer they are not there
2005-04-22T16:40:00.000Z	kenny		*i cant
2005-04-22T16:41:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	 This is a common problem
2005-04-22T16:41:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	 I try restarting nautilus...
2005-04-22T16:43:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	When you insert a CD rom into the drive, does it automatically show it in places-computer?
2005-04-22T16:44:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	Try this.  right click on your desktop, click open terminal
2005-04-22T16:44:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	killall nautilus
2005-04-22T16:45:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	Did it restart the desktop?
2005-04-22T16:46:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	alright, looks like you're having the same trouble that I am...  This is all a relatively new feature in gnome, one being embraced by ubuntu.
2005-04-22T16:46:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	 My temporary fix was to restart dbus-1
2005-04-22T16:47:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	heh they're getting better...  But try this for me.  /etc/init.d/dbus-1 restart
2005-04-22T16:47:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	then killall nautilus.  See if it shows up
2005-04-22T16:48:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	 I just tried that today :) I reboot like once a month, so I wouldn't know lol
2005-04-22T16:49:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	Chances are it wouldn't.  Not everyone has the problem, just a few people...  What hardware are you running?
2005-04-22T16:50:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	I'm curious to see if you have a similar setup to mine.
2005-04-22T16:52:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	what do you mean?  It should do it automatically.  The problem lies in the hardware abstraction layer telling nautilus that it is mounted...
2005-04-22T16:57:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	 I don't know what you meant about ubuntu not mounting at startup...
2005-04-22T16:58:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	it should be a matter of adding a line in your /etc/fstab
2005-04-22T05:00:00.000Z	SeamusLP	kenny	Under options I just have user for that partition...
