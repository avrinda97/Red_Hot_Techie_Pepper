2008-10-28T19:36:00.000Z	mikebeecham		lol
2008-10-28T19:38:00.000Z	mikebeecham		should I get 8.04, or get bleeding edge when it's dropped?
2008-10-28T19:39:00.000Z	joaopinto	mikebeecham	not more than 8.04 was :)
2008-12-07T21:39:00.000Z	mikebeecham	joaopinto	what was that sorry mate>?
2008-12-07T21:43:00.000Z	mikebeecham	joaopinto	I found the command to see what my duplex was, and I have 100mbps full duplex, but when I try ethtool eth1 then it tells me that it cannot get device settings?  Does this make any sense to you
2008-12-07T21:43:00.000Z	joaopinto	mikebeecham	is eth1 your device name ? have you checked with ifconfig -a ?
2008-12-07T21:44:00.000Z	mikebeecham	joaopinto	I have eth0 and also a 'lo' (loopback)
2008-12-07T21:45:00.000Z	mikebeecham	joaopinto	I also have an pan0
2008-12-07T21:45:00.000Z	mikebeecham	joaopinto	eth0 should be the main one I think!
2008-12-07T21:45:00.000Z	joaopinto	mikebeecham	do you have an eth0 on ifconfig ?
2008-12-07T21:47:00.000Z	mikebeecham	joaopinto	yessir.  When I try sudo ethtool eth0, I can see that I have 1000Mb/s and full duplex
2008-12-07T21:47:00.000Z	mikebeecham	joaopinto	sorry, 100Mb/s
2008-12-07T21:47:00.000Z	joaopinto	mikebeecham	and what are you trying to achieve ?
2008-12-07T21:48:00.000Z	mikebeecham	joaopinto	I have a mac and a linux machine on the same network....the mac is running fine, but the lInux machine's browsing and downloading speed is VERY VERY slow...something is wrong and I can't figure out what mate.
2008-12-07T21:48:00.000Z	joaopinto	mikebeecham	ah ok :\
2008-12-07T21:49:00.000Z	joaopinto	mikebeecham	is your dns properly configured ?
2008-12-07T21:49:00.000Z	joaopinto	mikebeecham	it could be a driver issue, not related to the network speed setting
2008-12-07T21:49:00.000Z	mikebeecham	joaopinto	it's been running fine for weeks without issue...it suddenly stopped working yesterday
2008-12-07T21:50:00.000Z	joaopinto	mikebeecham	that is very odd, I would only expect such problems after a kernel upgrade...
2008-12-07T22:18:00.000Z	mikebeecham	joaopinto	mate...I figured it out...but not happy.  It was a dodgy microfilter :(
2009-10-09T18:49:00.000Z	joaopinto	mikebeecham	nothing special except the extra disk space usage :P
