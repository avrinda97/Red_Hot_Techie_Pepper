2009-01-12T04:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	gerob	 you have tried the drivers in the repositories and via envyng if those failed FIRST?
2009-01-12T04:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	gerob	 if you really MUST use the nvidia instrallers.. go to console (alt-ctrl-f1) and use sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop    to make X stop. then run the installer  'sudo sh whatever.run'
2009-01-12T04:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	gerob	 good luck getting them to work... :) the repo versions or envy0ng is a better bet.
2009-01-12T04:47:00.000Z	gerob	dr_willis	 I couldnt get envyng to run
2009-01-12T04:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	gerob	 just an idiotic extension they use the means 'run me'
2009-01-12T04:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	gerob	 it could be a binary, not  a shell script.. i imagine that file is a bit of both
2009-01-12T04:48:00.000Z	gerob	dr_willis	I believe it a bit of both
2009-01-12T04:48:00.000Z	gerob	dr_willis	im willing to try envng if I can get it to run
2009-01-12T04:49:00.000Z	gerob	dr_willis	so do I use the gtk one then?
2009-01-12T04:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	gerob	 if you want.  its for gnome
2009-01-12T04:53:00.000Z	gerob	dr_willis	ok .... i got it through the package manager now what?
2009-01-12T04:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	gerob	 run it?
2009-01-12T04:54:00.000Z	gerob	dr_willis	there is no GUI for it and the envyng -t comes up with an error
2009-01-12T04:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	gerob	  No idea then. last i ran it from a terminal on my other laptop it ran fine for me   - You did run       sudo envyng-gtk ?
2009-01-12T04:56:00.000Z	gerob	dr_willis	sudo: envyng-gtk: command not found
2009-01-12T04:58:00.000Z	gerob	dr_willis	flannel: ok ill try that
2009-01-12T04:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	gerob	 just to clarify - you DID use the 'restricted-drivers manager' tool to try the nvidia drivers in the repositories FIRST?
2009-01-12T05:05:00.000Z	gerob	dr_willis	 By the restricted driver manager you mean the one named Hardware Manager?
2009-01-12T05:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	gerob	 proberly- they keep changing its name.
2009-01-12T05:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	gerob	 from the cli the command is  jockey-gtk :)
2009-01-12T05:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	gerob	 if you really MUST use the nvidia instrallers.. go to console (alt-ctrl-f1) and use sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop    to make X stop. then run the installer  'sudo sh whatever.run'
