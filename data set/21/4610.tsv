2008-04-05T16:00:00.000Z	hischild	saminthemiddle	that means when i cat /proc/cpuinfo it should list kvm as one of the flags?
2008-04-05T16:01:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	hischild	yes, it should show KVM support
2008-04-05T16:02:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	hischild	one moment
2008-04-05T16:05:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	hischild	I think it's VME, but I'm not sure about that
2008-04-05T16:06:00.000Z	hischild	saminthemiddle	yup that one is there as well
2008-04-05T16:07:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	hischild	just try it, if it doesn't work you will know it ;-)
2008-04-05T16:07:00.000Z	hischild	saminthemiddle	i don't really like surprises :P but i'm going to give it a shot now :-) just have to enable the host only networking again
2008-04-05T16:10:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	hischild	good luck
2008-04-05T16:11:00.000Z	hischild	saminthemiddle	with? the converting?
2008-04-05T16:11:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	hischild	no idea
2008-04-05T16:12:00.000Z	hischild	saminthemiddle	well i'm not having much luck with the amd-v stuff :P and i'm trying to convert a vhd to vdi which is a pain so far
2008-04-05T16:13:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	hischild	did you modprobe kvm and kvm-amd?
2008-04-05T16:13:00.000Z	hischild	saminthemiddle	should i? (i know, probably yes)
2008-04-05T16:13:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	hischild	won't work w/o it
2008-04-05T16:14:00.000Z	hischild	saminthemiddle	it's booting alright, just slow like i've never seen before
2008-04-05T16:14:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	hischild	using the command kvm bla bla bla /home/yourfile?
2008-04-05T16:14:00.000Z	hischild	saminthemiddle	nope, just enabled the switch in vbox and booted it. It was incredibly slow and jittery, but it was just booting. Attempt 2 with kvm going now.
2008-04-05T16:15:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	hischild	try the kvm thing from the command line
2008-04-05T16:16:00.000Z	hischild	saminthemiddle	tbqh i have no idea how to do that. I  only use vbox for some stuff at school dat requires windows so far ...
2008-04-05T16:17:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	hischild	it's really easy. go look it up on google, there are lots of tutorials
2008-04-05T16:17:00.000Z	hischild	saminthemiddle	alright i'll check it
