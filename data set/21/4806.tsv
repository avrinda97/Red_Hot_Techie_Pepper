2009-06-03T15:55:00.000Z	kamikaze		what path im giving ? well im not sure, but im using ubuntu 8.10
2009-06-03T15:57:00.000Z	kamikaze		Well, it comes up with this kamikaze@kamikaze-desktop:~$ sudo chmod +x /home/username/mount.sh
2009-06-03T15:57:00.000Z	kamikaze		chmod: cannot access `/home/username/mount.sh': No such file or directory
2009-06-03T15:57:00.000Z	kamikaze		kamikaze@kamikaze-desktop:~$
2009-06-03T15:57:00.000Z	Chousuke	kamikaze	I doubt there's a user named "username" on your system
2009-06-03T15:58:00.000Z	Chousuke	kamikaze	and you don't need sudo for the chmod command
2009-06-03T15:59:00.000Z	kamikaze	Chousuke	ohh .. but it still cant .. it comes up with the same .. cant find thing ..
2009-06-03T16:00:00.000Z	Chousuke	kamikaze	where did you download the file to?
2009-06-03T16:01:00.000Z	kamikaze	Chousuke	I didnt dowlnoad any file?
2009-06-03T16:01:00.000Z	Chousuke	kamikaze	well, where is the mount.sh file then?
2009-06-03T16:01:00.000Z	Chousuke	kamikaze	the /home/whatever/mount.sh is a file path, telling where on the disk the file is.
2009-06-03T16:01:00.000Z	Chousuke	kamikaze	of course, it actually has to be there for things to work
2009-06-03T16:02:00.000Z	Chousuke	kamikaze	the error you get is saying it's not there, so perhaps it's somewhere else. where did you put it?
2009-06-03T16:02:00.000Z	kamikaze	Chousuke	 So the ISO file i want to mount shall be in the home folder before it would work ?
2009-06-03T16:03:00.000Z	Chousuke	kamikaze	um, no. the _mount.sh_ file is missing
2009-06-03T16:03:00.000Z	Chousuke	kamikaze	you need to mount an iso file or something? can't you do that in gnome?
2009-06-03T16:04:00.000Z	kamikaze	Chousuke	 Ohh... i think i just need to get the ISO file, i thought it was scripts i was installing by this, but now i know what to do when the iso file is on my Home :)
2009-06-03T16:04:00.000Z	Chousuke	kamikaze	er, how does the .iso file matter? isn't your error with the mount.sh file?
2009-06-03T16:05:00.000Z	kamikaze	Chousuke	yes cause the ISO file isnt on my computer yet.
2009-06-03T16:05:00.000Z	Chousuke	kamikaze	you can do just "mount -oloop -tiso9660 file.iso /directory/to/mount/to"
2009-06-03T16:05:00.000Z	kamikaze	Chousuke	Can i mount my ISO file just by writing that ??
