2008-03-25T20:47:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes		ok, so how do I set my sendmail up so I don't get "Deferred: connection timed out" when I send mail?
2008-03-25T20:48:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxMercedes	thats normally because your machine can't talk to the target machine
2008-03-25T20:48:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	ikonia	ok
2008-03-25T20:48:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	ikonia	well, the reciever is my gmail account, so it should be accessible
2008-03-25T20:49:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxMercedes	are you on a dhcp address or home/cable/adsl line ?
2008-03-25T20:49:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	ikonia	dsl
2008-03-25T20:49:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxMercedes	google may be black listing you as your not meant to run mail servers on home connections
2008-03-25T20:49:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	ikonia	ok
2008-03-25T20:49:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxMercedes	google uses some blacklists and most home/dsl/cable connections will be blacklisted
2008-03-25T20:49:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	ikonia	alright, does aol, too?
2008-03-25T20:51:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	ikonia	alright, do you have any suggestions as to how I can set my server up to be able to mail out to some people?
2008-03-25T20:51:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxMercedes	use your ISP's smtp server
2008-03-25T20:51:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	ikonia	would SMPT be a better choice?
2008-03-25T20:51:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	ikonia	alright, so if I use, say, smpt.gmail.com, that should work?
2008-03-25T20:52:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxMercedes	no - is your ISP gmail ?
2008-03-25T20:52:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxMercedes	to use gmail's smtp server you need to some sort of smtp authentication
2008-03-25T20:52:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	ikonia	no, AT&T
2008-03-25T20:52:00.000Z	ikonia	LinuxMercedes	so your smtp server would be the smtp server that AT&T provide for you
2008-03-25T20:53:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	ikonia	alright, I'll look and see what that is
2008-03-25T21:23:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	ikonia	alright, I set my smtp sever to smtp.att.yahoo.com, but I'm still not getting mail
2008-03-25T21:31:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	ikonia	I'm guessing that it's because AT&T's smtp sever is secured, and I don't think my software supports secured SMTP
