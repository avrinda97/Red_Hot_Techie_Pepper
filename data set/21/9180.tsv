2010-01-08T04:27:00.000Z	ssn		hi guys
2010-01-08T04:28:00.000Z	ssn		i have a big problem with xorg/lxde under ubuntu.
2010-01-08T04:28:00.000Z	ssn		the max resolution always (on any machine) is 800x600
2010-01-08T04:28:00.000Z	ssn		xrandr says this is the maximum resolution
2010-01-08T04:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ssn	 give details... video card chipset, monitor type.. what exact dviers you installed..
2010-01-08T04:29:00.000Z	ssn	Dr_Willis	virtualbox
2010-01-08T04:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ssn	 for virtualbox - install the guest-addations
2010-01-08T04:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ssn	 you will gain higher res and better performacne
2010-01-08T04:29:00.000Z	ssn	Dr_Willis	but i tried it on 4 different machines and it was the same
2010-01-08T04:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ssn	 you are doing somthing wrong then. Ive ran several disrtos in vbox. and untill i get the guest addons installed - the res will stay low.
2010-01-08T04:30:00.000Z	ssn	Dr_Willis	ok
2010-01-18T02:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ssn	dosent the $user vaiable  show the user.. or was it $USER
2010-04-26T18:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ssn	 install build-essential for starters
2010-04-26T18:20:00.000Z	ssn	Dr_Willis	how?
2010-04-26T18:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ssn	 with the package manager.
2010-04-26T18:20:00.000Z	ssn	Dr_Willis	there is none
2010-04-26T18:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ssn	 the mini iso dosent come with apt? i find that hard to belive
2010-04-26T18:21:00.000Z	ssn	Dr_Willis	me to, but thats it
2010-04-26T18:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ssn	 no idea then.  unless others in here want to correct this and tell us properly how to do it
2011-04-11T18:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ssn	 could be some 'relative' vs 'absolute' setting. Seen wacom tablets have it where they can work either way.  No idea where to set it at however
2011-04-11T18:14:00.000Z	ssn	Dr_Willis	exactly my problem
