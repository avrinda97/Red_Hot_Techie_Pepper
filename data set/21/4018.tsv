2008-07-30T15:28:00.000Z	xnv	facker	Where do you see this message and what media player are you currently trying?
2008-07-30T15:28:00.000Z	facker	xnv	kaffeine
2008-07-30T15:29:00.000Z	xnv	facker	How is the message displayed?
2008-07-30T15:29:00.000Z	facker	xnv	in the player. back screen
2008-07-30T15:30:00.000Z	xnv	facker	So are you sure you didn't just download an advertisement for "go" player?

2008-07-30T15:31:00.000Z	xnv	facker	What is that?
2008-07-30T15:32:00.000Z	facker	xnv	go player web
2008-07-30T15:32:00.000Z	xnv	facker	So how does that answer my question?
2008-07-30T15:34:00.000Z	facker	xnv	i dl a 700 mb file.
2008-07-30T15:34:00.000Z	xnv	facker	And?
2008-07-30T15:34:00.000Z	facker	xnv	and it gives the msg when played. dl go player. content blocked
2008-07-30T15:34:00.000Z	xnv	facker	You said the message was in the player on the screen, no?
2008-07-30T15:35:00.000Z	facker	xnv	ya
2008-07-30T15:36:00.000Z	xnv	facker	So, again, what makes you think you didn't just download a 700 MB advertisement? You wouldn't be the first.
2008-07-30T15:36:00.000Z	facker	xnv	i dl 2 files. each with a diff media requiremnt
2008-07-30T15:37:00.000Z	facker	xnv	and that file was hosted by many users. any way. never mind
2008-07-30T15:37:00.000Z	xnv	facker	Companies can fake seeds/peers to make a torrent look popular
2008-07-30T15:37:00.000Z	facker	xnv	ok
