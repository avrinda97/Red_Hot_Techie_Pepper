2009-03-29T21:00:00.000Z	rover35		just a moment, i am writing it...
2009-03-29T21:01:00.000Z	rover35		I had a usb device working correctly, and now after compiling the drivers (i wanted to update them), my usb cinergy terratec hybrid xs fm tuner do not work anymore
2009-03-29T21:02:00.000Z	rover35		and also i suppose the lsusb command do not list the same identifier as before i update the drivers
2009-03-29T21:02:00.000Z	rover35		it was not broken, but the fm was not working, and i wanted to see if an update could fix it
2009-03-29T21:03:00.000Z	rover35		yes
2009-03-29T21:03:00.000Z	rover35		dmizer...??
2009-03-29T21:05:00.000Z	rover35		i did a hg clone on one repository (i don't remember it)
2009-03-29T21:07:00.000Z	dmizer	rover35	did an hd clone on a repository?
2009-03-29T21:01:00.000Z	dmizer	rover35	if it's not broken ... don't fix it ;)
2009-03-29T21:03:00.000Z	dmizer	rover35	did you use the "make install" command?
2009-03-29T21:03:00.000Z	dmizer	rover35	there's not much hope for getting rid of that i'm afraid.
2009-03-29T21:04:00.000Z	dmizer	rover35	where did you get your updated drivers?
2009-03-29T21:06:00.000Z	rover35	dmizer	i did a hg clone on one repository (i don't remember it)
2009-03-29T21:09:00.000Z	rover35	dmizer	i fund the command i did: "hg clone http://mcentral.de/hg/~mrec/em28xx-new"
2009-03-29T21:10:00.000Z	dmizer	rover35	sorry, i'm not familiar with hg clone.
2009-03-29T21:11:00.000Z	rover35	dmizer	just to simplify, i have 2 drivers, one was correct (it did worked correctly : before i install the second one) and after installing and rebooting from the second install the lsusb command show a differend vid:pid
2009-03-29T21:13:00.000Z	rover35	dmizer	so one of my questions is "how does the lsusb get the vid and pid of the device, why has it changed...?"
2009-03-29T21:14:00.000Z	dmizer	rover35	you're problem is outside my area of expertise. i'm really very sorry.
2009-03-29T21:16:00.000Z	rover35	dmizer	may be you can help anyway :-), i am currently compiling a kernel.org kernel, i think it won't install correctly (if it finish compiling), ause i 'm on a ubuntu system, how patch the kernel from the kernel.org site for my ubuntu...?
