2007-03-20T06:40:00.000Z	froydin1		how do i delete something from my applications menu ?
2007-03-20T06:41:00.000Z	aoirthoir	froydin1	if you wish to install common programs like firefox..use apt-get install or aptitude or synaptic instead of downloading from the website..then all your appropriate settings will be made
2007-03-20T06:43:00.000Z	froydin1	aoirthoir	well i already installed the firefox2 and its ok ... but now i can only lunch from mozilla-firefox , instead of firefox, so everything that uses firefox its not working anymore, whut u think would be better, uninstall it and try throught the synaptics, bcuz i could not get it from the apt-get , but my guess i just have to create a symlink to firefox -> mozilla-firefox right ?
2007-03-20T06:45:00.000Z	aoirthoir	froydin1	install with synaptic
2007-03-20T06:50:00.000Z	aoirthoir	froydin1	the reason to use the package managers is that they are exactly just that..a full package manager, including all dependencies, all menu setups, and so on.
