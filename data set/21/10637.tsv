2005-01-13T17:39:00.000Z	neighborlee		will future versions of ubuntu  have java pre-installed ???
2005-01-13T17:39:00.000Z	neighborlee		also is there a 'easy' way to install it ? :(
2005-01-13T17:40:00.000Z	neighborlee		http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/AddingJavaSupport/view?searchterm=java < easier than this crap I mean
2005-01-13T17:40:00.000Z	neighborlee		nope can't be
2005-01-13T17:40:00.000Z	neighborlee		other distros have it preinstalled
2005-01-13T17:40:00.000Z	neighborlee		i'm sure of it
2005-01-13T17:41:00.000Z	neighborlee		suse does..mepis does
2005-01-13T17:41:00.000Z	gilgamesh	neighborlee	- dunno, probably not, since it's not 100% oss, IIRC.  installation is easy enough, try: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=3713&highlight=java+install
2005-01-13T17:43:00.000Z	gilgamesh	neighborlee	- it isn't as easy as pre-installed, but c'mon, just open a terminal, type sudo -s to get a root console, and copy/paste the commands from the tutorial into the console.  How hard is that?
2005-01-13T17:45:00.000Z	gilgamesh	neighborlee	to my grandmother, WindowsUpdate might as well be a root console, she's just as confused.  There's no love lost for installing apps in Windows.
2005-01-13T17:45:00.000Z	neighborlee	gilgamesh	installing apps in windows is dead easy
2005-01-13T17:45:00.000Z	neighborlee	gilgamesh	but in ubuntu it is as well mostly....using synaptic ;-)
2005-01-13T06:01:00.000Z	neighborlee	gilgamesh	thats not the point and you know it
2005-01-13T06:02:00.000Z	neighborlee	gilgamesh	and atm i'm unable to even find the directions to install java for browsers..its supposedly on a 'wiki' but i'm not finding it
2005-01-13T06:02:00.000Z	gilgamesh	neighborlee	I posted this twice already, read: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=3713&highlight=java+install
2005-01-13T06:03:00.000Z	neighborlee	gilgamesh	thats part of it yes
2005-01-13T06:03:00.000Z	neighborlee	gilgamesh	'some' form of java yes should be ready to rock ( at least for web browsing)
2005-01-13T06:04:00.000Z	gilgamesh	neighborlee	- then post it in the development mailing list, maybe you can convince someone who matters. :)
2005-01-13T06:04:00.000Z	neighborlee	gilgamesh	I surely will
2005-01-13T06:29:00.000Z	neighborlee	gilgamesh	okay I have been VERY busy..anyway..your time spent finding URL IS appreciated do not mistake that...however if I have to go through that just to get java working...i'll have to think about if i'm using the right distro or not which is sad because i'm come to love ubuntu and its philosophies ( some of them anyway)...I just hope someday soon they consider making java for browsing preinstalled like other distros do
2005-01-13T06:30:00.000Z	gilgamesh	neighborlee	- your thanks are appreciated, you're welcome.  however, I would advise that you stick with Ubuntu for a couple weeks and see if it meets most of your expectations before jumping to another distro.
