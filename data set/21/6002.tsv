2007-06-20T15:42:00.000Z	harisamin	Music_Shuffle	yes coz i tried them on other computers...they are fine
2007-06-20T15:44:00.000Z	harisamin	Music_Shuffle	i'm running OS X right now...my orginial computer a few days ago got fired...and i had bveen running ubuntu for a year now...i really like it and was tring to run it on this mac...i have ubunut badger running on an old powerbook...
2007-06-20T15:45:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	harisamin	oh, I dunno, I just remember that when I fried a RAM stick in a PC, didn't realize it, and then tried to reinstall Edgy, the same thing happened to me.  /Shrug.
2007-06-20T15:45:00.000Z	harisamin	Music_Shuffle	i did put in a different RAM chim later on on this MAC....i just wanted to add some more RAM...you think that might have been teh problem?
2007-06-20T15:46:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	harisamin	how much RAM is in there?
2007-06-20T15:47:00.000Z	harisamin	Music_Shuffle	before when ubuntu was running on this RAM it had 768 mb
2007-06-20T15:47:00.000Z	harisamin	Music_Shuffle	i added a 512 RAM chip...you think that might be messing it up?
2007-06-20T15:47:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	harisamin	it worked before you added it?
2007-06-20T15:47:00.000Z	harisamin	Music_Shuffle	yeah
2007-06-20T15:48:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	harisamin	logical conclusion: remove it and see what happens :D
