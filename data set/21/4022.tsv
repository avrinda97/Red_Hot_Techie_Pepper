2008-07-30T09:42:00.000Z	dcolish		sudo su -l
2008-07-30T09:42:00.000Z	Flannel	dcolish	No.  sudo -i
2008-07-30T09:45:00.000Z	Flannel	dcolish	yes, but one only uses one program, and is shorter.
2008-07-30T09:46:00.000Z	dcolish	Flannel	is it really that much shorter?
2008-07-30T09:46:00.000Z	Flannel	dcolish	Not really, no, but it does use one one program instead of two.
2008-07-30T09:52:00.000Z	Flannel	dcolish	I believe that'd be -s with sudo
2008-07-30T09:54:00.000Z	dcolish	Flannel	and so it does
2008-07-30T09:55:00.000Z	dcolish	Flannel	habits are hard things to break
2008-07-30T09:55:00.000Z	Flannel	dcolish	You're welcome to use what you will, but please only recommend sudo in this channel.
2008-07-30T09:55:00.000Z	dcolish	Flannel	lets be clear that I suggested sudo su -l
2008-07-30T09:56:00.000Z	dcolish	Flannel	I am pretty sure the net result is the same
2008-07-30T09:56:00.000Z	Flannel	dcolish	right, and in the future, sudo -i would be better.
2008-07-30T09:57:00.000Z	dcolish	Flannel	it appears that way, but I dont see why you need to suggest I recommended insecure admin practices
2008-07-30T09:57:00.000Z	Flannel	dcolish	I don't believe I ever did so.
2008-07-30T09:58:00.000Z	dcolish	Flannel	maybe I am missing something, but I am pretty sure you reprimanded me for not suggesting use of sudo
2008-07-30T09:59:00.000Z	Flannel	dcolish	channel policy is sudo (because that's Ubuntu policy), sudo su - is better as sudo -i, sudo su is better as sudo -s
2008-07-30T10:00:00.000Z	Flannel	dcolish	I apologise if it sounded like I was saying you were being unsafe
2008-07-30T10:01:00.000Z	dcolish	Flannel	I agree that both sudo -i and sudo -s are better and my habits have been to use sudo su -l or sudo su -p
2008-07-30T10:10:00.000Z	dcolish	Flannel	one curiosity, why include su at all if ubuntu does not approve of its use
2008-07-30T10:11:00.000Z	Flannel	dcolish	because some people prefer it, and its one of those things "all" linuxes have.
2008-07-30T10:12:00.000Z	dcolish	Flannel	Bogus8: a user could easily install it if they chose
