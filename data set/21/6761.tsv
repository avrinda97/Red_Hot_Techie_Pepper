2007-04-25T09:05:00.000Z	luddite		euraio: its linked from a bigpond.net.au page if i recall correctly
2007-04-25T09:05:00.000Z	luddite		yup - go for it
2007-04-25T09:06:00.000Z	luddite		hey all, i installed the low latency kernal for ubuntu and it wont load xserver on reboot. the error says that nvidia failed to load. (i have nvidia working in normal ubuntu 7.04)
2007-04-25T09:07:00.000Z	zeifer	luddite	you'll have to reinstall the nvidia kernel with the new kernel sources.
2007-04-25T09:07:00.000Z	luddite	zeifer	into the low latecy kernal? or the regular kernal?
2007-04-25T09:08:00.000Z	luddite	zeifer	i cant actually get in a gui (only command line). how would i go about that
2007-04-25T09:09:00.000Z	zeifer	luddite	How did you install the nVidia driver to begin with? Did you use Envy or something?
2007-04-25T09:10:00.000Z	luddite	zeifer	i installed 7.04, then installed the nvidai drivers, then installed the lowlatency kernal. then restarted and xserver no nvidia error appeared
2007-04-25T09:11:00.000Z	zeifer	luddite	The best way to go about installing an operating xserver with nvidia drivers is to hold off on installing the nvidia drivers until you're using the kernel you are planning on updating to. At this point, you may want to over-write your existing xorg.conf with the backup one that the nvidia driver should have created for you.
2007-04-25T09:12:00.000Z	luddite	zeifer	thanks - so i did it backwards. considering i dont want to re-install 7.04, (its set up perfectly) can i re-install the nvidia drivers?
2007-04-25T09:13:00.000Z	zeifer	luddite	You should be able to get back into xserver after over-writing the xorg.conf with the previous one. Then install the nvidia drivers to the running kernel, reboot xserver and you *should* be set.
2007-04-25T09:15:00.000Z	luddite	zeifer	would i have to uninstall nvidia to do that in the standard kernal-i never made a backup os xorg.congf
2007-04-25T09:16:00.000Z	zeifer	luddite	You should have one that was created by the installation of the nvidia drivers. Look in /etc/X11/ for anything containing the file name xorg.conf.bak or similar.
2007-04-25T09:19:00.000Z	luddite	zeifer	thanks very much. i will try that asap.
2007-04-25T09:19:00.000Z	luddite	zeifer	there is no bak version :-|
2007-04-25T09:20:00.000Z	zeifer	luddite	There's nothing there that has xorg.conf in the filename?
2007-04-25T09:23:00.000Z	luddite	zeifer	unfortunately no.
2007-04-25T09:25:00.000Z	zeifer	luddite	I would give you an example xorg.conf to try to reset your problem but my current system I am on is a laptop with ATi graphics/drivers installed.
2007-04-25T09:27:00.000Z	luddite	zeifer	thanks for the help - im going to uninstall the nvidia restricted drivers
2007-04-25T09:27:00.000Z	zeifer	luddite	I wish you luck there, I've never uninstalled drivers before so I hope it works for you.
2007-04-25T09:28:00.000Z	luddite	zeifer	same :-)
