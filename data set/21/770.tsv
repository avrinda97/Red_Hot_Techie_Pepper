2011-06-20T18:18:00.000Z	Chotaz		why does brasero corrupt every single CD I burn with it?(it's not the drive, growisofs works just fine for disk images) If I drag soem filed into a blank disc and click write to disk
2011-06-20T18:18:00.000Z	Chotaz		after burnint itll say that the files may be corrupt
2011-06-20T18:20:00.000Z	Chotaz		huh, I dont feel like downloading a whole new dm just to get a burning app
2011-06-20T18:21:00.000Z	Chotaz		wodim
2011-06-20T18:21:00.000Z	Chotaz		ill try that
2011-06-20T18:21:00.000Z	Chotaz		i try to install k3b and it asks me to download 245MB worth of files,
2011-06-20T18:22:00.000Z	dinkdink	Chotaz	well before you run off to wodim.. it's a command line tool
2011-06-20T18:22:00.000Z	Chotaz	dinkdink	no problem with that
2011-06-20T18:22:00.000Z	dinkdink		man up ;)
2011-06-20T18:22:00.000Z	dinkdink		\
2011-06-20T18:22:00.000Z	Chotaz		I just need to burn 3 cds urgently.
2011-06-20T18:23:00.000Z	dinkdink		chotaz do this sudo wodim --devices
2011-06-20T18:23:00.000Z	Chotaz	dinkdink	did
2011-06-20T18:24:00.000Z	dinkdink	Chotaz	sudo wodim -eject -tao speed=96 -v -data /dev/scd# /pat/to/image.iso
2011-06-20T18:25:00.000Z	dinkdink	Chotaz	replace /dev/scd# with your actual burner and path to image to actual location of image
2011-06-20T18:25:00.000Z	Chotaz		its a buncha files, not an iso, i'd use growisofs for that
2011-06-20T18:25:00.000Z	dinkdink	Chotaz	well cant help you there.. havent done that myself
2011-06-20T18:26:00.000Z	Chotaz		xfburn worked just fine, thanks dinkdink, ActionParsnip and dr_willis
2011-06-20T18:27:00.000Z	dinkdink	Chotaz	but if i were you i might looking into creating an iso of your files
2011-06-20T18:27:00.000Z	Chotaz	dinkdink	any particular reason?
2011-06-20T18:28:00.000Z	dinkdink	Chotaz	working with images is less messy
