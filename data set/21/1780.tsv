2010-05-01T05:39:00.000Z	Guest30062		Has anyone here used creative MP3 players with ubuntu? If so, what's the experience been like?
2010-05-01T05:39:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Guest30062	Why not just try it and see? You might be surprised.
2010-05-01T05:41:00.000Z	Guest30062	LinuxGuy2009	I don't like to be surprised
2010-05-01T05:47:00.000Z	Guest30062	LinuxGuy2009	is there some statistical info regarding the number of failed downloads?
2010-05-01T05:47:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Guest30062	Not sure what your asking there?
2010-05-01T05:48:00.000Z	Guest30062	LinuxGuy2009	how often can one expect to get a corrupt ISO?
2010-05-01T05:49:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Guest30062	One can expect to get a failed ISO......never. How could you ever know in advance?
2010-05-01T05:49:00.000Z	Guest30062	LinuxGuy2009	IDE bad
2010-05-01T05:49:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Guest30062	 IDE bad why?
2010-05-01T05:50:00.000Z	Guest30062	LinuxGuy2009	I thought there might be a precedent or statistic for bad images
2010-05-01T05:50:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Guest30062	No the image is perfect on the server always.
2010-05-01T05:51:00.000Z	Guest30062	LinuxGuy2009	Block level controller in IDE mode doesn't seem to like modern OS's much. I was thinking he should check the drive's firmware however dangerous if one doesn't
2010-05-01T05:51:00.000Z	Guest30062	LinuxGuy2009	that's regarding Sata in IDE
2010-05-01T05:52:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Guest30062	Im using IDE mode with 2 500GB SATAs with no issues. So???
2010-05-01T05:52:00.000Z	Guest30062	LinuxGuy2009	not an issues if it's actually a physical IDE
2010-05-01T05:52:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Guest30062	I think your confused. SATA has different modes in the bios.
2010-05-01T05:52:00.000Z	Guest30062	LinuxGuy2009	prolly not everyone will have issues. Do you use AMD or Intel?
2010-05-01T05:53:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Guest30062	AMD Phenom
2010-05-01T05:53:00.000Z	Guest30062	LinuxGuy2009	I know this using Sata as IDE has the potential for headaches...
2010-05-01T05:53:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Guest30062	Headaches? Its like the most reliable one to use. Its like a default setting on most boards.
2010-05-01T05:54:00.000Z	Guest30062	LinuxGuy2009	who makes your controller (North/South Bridge) ?
