2008-01-10T22:36:00.000Z	saerg		hi, i have a problem with my samsung laptop and the ubuntu 7.10 live-dvd: it boots very slowly and stops at "Running local boot scripts... [ok]"
2008-01-10T22:37:00.000Z	XLV	saerg	could be multiple reasons, try disabling usb legacy support in BIOS, worked for me
2008-01-10T22:38:00.000Z	XLV	saerg	boot in safe graphics mode doesnt work?
2008-01-10T22:38:00.000Z	saerg	XLV	no, i'll try the bios option
2008-01-10T22:43:00.000Z	saerg	XLV	it's as slow as before...
2008-01-10T22:43:00.000Z	XLV	saerg	well, in my case i also used text install, and it was slow for me too.. i especially had to wait some mins to show x server, but when it installed, it run fine
2008-01-10T22:44:00.000Z	saerg	XLV	crap, so i can forget using the live part?
2008-01-10T22:44:00.000Z	XLV	saerg	basically i used the bios option i said, and also iirc irqpoll=off
2008-01-10T22:45:00.000Z	XLV	saerg	i only used the live cd to install the thing on HDD
2008-01-10T22:50:00.000Z	saerg	XLV	just curious.. how slow was it for you? the live part ran 15-20 minutes before it stopped at "Running local boot scripts... [ok]" on my laptop
2008-01-10T22:51:00.000Z	XLV	saerg	iirc not that slow.. it stayed in the last text message for about a min or two before it loaded x server
2008-01-10T22:52:00.000Z	XLV	saerg	you should try supplying those boot parameters to kernel .. select text mode boot, then in boot prompt type expert ( or install ) acpi=off or irqpoll=off etc
2008-01-10T22:52:00.000Z	saerg	XLV	k, thx
2008-01-10T22:54:00.000Z	XLV	saerg	how new is the laptop? latest laptops using intel chipsets like 965 and core2duo use EFI BIOSes and pose those problems, eg with usb legacy option
2008-01-10T22:55:00.000Z	saerg	XLV	samsung r60p
2008-01-10T22:58:00.000Z	saerg	XLV	t5250 and phoenix bios
2008-01-10T23:00:00.000Z	XLV	saerg	its not bios maker, but bios type.. new EFI BIOSes allow various modules to be inserted more easily etc.. couldnt find hardware config of the laptop though, so i cant say if it uses one or not, its quite likely
2008-01-10T23:00:00.000Z	XLV	saerg	try the boot kernel parameters
2008-01-10T23:06:00.000Z	saerg	XLV	Samsung R60 Aura T5250 Deeloy (NP-R60FY0) <-- this looks like mine
2008-01-10T23:22:00.000Z	saerg	XLV	gtg, thanks for the help - i'll try it later
2008-01-10T23:23:00.000Z	XLV	saerg	np
