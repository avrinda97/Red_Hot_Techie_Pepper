2005-11-22T06:33:00.000Z	QuestionZ		I have Windows XP installed on my computer, and I wanted Ubuntu as well. So naturally, I opted to install GRUB after installing Ubuntu, but when I restart my computer, I get a GRUB Error 21. Can somsone tell me what is going on?
2005-11-22T06:34:00.000Z	Delobox	QuestionZ	you could manually install grub, but i'd just go ahead and install ubuntu again and this time choose to install grub while installing ubuntu
2005-11-22T06:34:00.000Z	Delobox	QuestionZ	it respects your windows XP installation ust fine
2005-11-22T06:35:00.000Z	QuestionZ	Delobox	I reinstalled Ubuntu 3 times, and from what I saw, it did install GRUB while it installed Ubuntu. And what do you mean that it respects my WinXP installation? Because I already had WinXP before I tried installing Ubuntu
2005-11-22T06:35:00.000Z	Delobox	QuestionZ	i had windows xp on my system and the grub install during ubuntu install didnt give me any problems
2005-11-22T06:36:00.000Z	QuestionZ	Delobox	Well, I wish it didn't give me any problems, but it is, it's "Error 21" and I have tried everything I can to fix it on my own.
2005-11-22T06:37:00.000Z	Delobox	QuestionZ	did you google error 21?
2005-11-22T06:37:00.000Z	Delobox	QuestionZ	this guy mentions it might have something to do with bios settings for hard drive autodetection http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-grub/2003-02/msg00082.html
2005-11-22T06:38:00.000Z	Delobox	QuestionZ	although that post implys it being a grub config issue, not neccessarily an ubuntu issue
2005-11-22T06:38:00.000Z	QuestionZ	Delobox	Well, I'll try anything at this point :P
2005-11-22T06:40:00.000Z	QuestionZ	Delobox	Wait, so I have to configure my BIOS for GRUB? I'm not completely understanding this.
2005-11-22T06:40:00.000Z	Delobox	QuestionZ	has grub ever worked on this machine before?
2005-11-22T06:40:00.000Z	Delobox	QuestionZ	grub is a very low level program, your bios settings could be giving it problems
2005-11-22T06:41:00.000Z	QuestionZ	Delobox	No
2005-11-22T06:41:00.000Z	QuestionZ	Delobox	No, as in it has never been run on this machine before
2005-11-22T06:41:00.000Z	Delobox	QuestionZ	then i'd suggest at least checking how your hard drives are detected.  Also, are these just plain IDE drives?
2005-11-22T06:41:00.000Z	QuestionZ	Delobox	Yes, plain IDE
2005-11-22T06:41:00.000Z	Delobox	QuestionZ	also, are you using a basic hard drive controller, not anything exotic like a Promise raid controller or anything like that
2005-11-22T06:41:00.000Z	Delobox	QuestionZ	cool, then just check to make sure your drives are set to autodetect in your bios "Standard Setup" section
2005-11-22T06:42:00.000Z	Delobox	QuestionZ	grub uses some autodetection code to find drives when it starts, certian bios configs may interfere with that
2005-11-22T06:42:00.000Z	QuestionZ	Delobox	Alright, I'm going to try that right now, if it doesn't work, I'll be back. Thanks for helping me thus far :)
