2005-10-07T06:16:00.000Z	propagandhi		read a few beta test reviews too
2005-10-07T06:17:00.000Z	propagandhi		actually, the win 3.1 was a hack of an apple desktop manager
2005-10-07T06:17:00.000Z	propagandhi		yeah
2005-10-07T06:17:00.000Z	propagandhi		but thats all it is, rating the eye candy factor
2005-10-07T06:18:00.000Z	propagandhi		its not going to make windows a good os
2005-10-07T06:18:00.000Z	propagandhi		all they've done is give it a new skin and a few extra links and gadgets
2005-10-07T06:19:00.000Z	propagandhi		yeah but i can make my box look just as nice with a little effort and the total price comes to $0
2005-10-07T06:20:00.000Z	propagandhi		I just feel windows is for a whole different user market
2005-10-07T06:21:00.000Z	propagandhi		linux/unix and mac are far superior in millions of other ways, windows is user and dummy friendly
2005-10-07T06:23:00.000Z	propagandhi		the amazing thing about linux is it's come out of a community of good will and faith in each other, with a very small budget, and windows has spent billions making their OS
2005-10-07T06:23:00.000Z	holycow	propagandhi	i would say that mac is more dummy friendly
2005-10-07T06:24:00.000Z	propagandhi	holycow	i agree
2005-10-07T06:25:00.000Z	holycow	propagandhi	yeah, that happens even to educated people and pros
2005-10-07T06:30:00.000Z	holycow	propagandhi	i wouldn't
2005-10-07T06:30:00.000Z	holycow	propagandhi	you would get a situation like xandros, its 80% there but its the 20% that frustrates them
2005-10-07T06:30:00.000Z	holycow	propagandhi	its much more productive to tell them its different and teach them
2005-10-07T06:31:00.000Z	holycow	propagandhi	i have a debian workstation 'sarge' pilot, it took 5 minutes to explain open office and internet use, and took them two weeks to get comfortable
2005-10-07T06:32:00.000Z	propagandhi	holycow	thats prett well what i mean though, i could kit our users out very quickly with a familiar-ish interface and it would only serve to reduce the transition time
2005-10-07T06:32:00.000Z	holycow	propagandhi	ah.  *nod*
2005-10-07T06:33:00.000Z	holycow	propagandhi	i like ubuntu for those sorts of reasons i guess.  the gnome philosophy is great for newbs, i can sit anyone down and say 'find internet' and they do.  or say 'find writer and write a document' and they do
2005-10-07T06:34:00.000Z	propagandhi	holycow	yeah i absolutely love ubuntu dont get me wrong, its a masterpiece
