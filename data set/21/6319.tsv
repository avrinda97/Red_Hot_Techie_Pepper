2007-04-27T07:57:00.000Z	eck	Och4	it's a regular FAT label, i think there's a program that does it in mtools
2007-04-27T07:57:00.000Z	Och4	eck	can't do it in the terminal?
2007-04-27T07:58:00.000Z	eck	Och4	you can do it from the terminal, the program that does it is part of the mtools package (or dosfstools maybe)
2007-04-27T07:58:00.000Z	Och4	eck	do i gotta install it? or it's already install??
2007-04-27T08:03:00.000Z	Och4	eck	 sorry i didn't see ya other messages
2007-04-27T07:59:00.000Z	eck	Och4	it is not already installed afaik
2007-04-27T07:59:00.000Z	eck	Och4	i think mtools will install a program called mlabel
2007-04-27T07:59:00.000Z	Och4	eck	do you know how to get it install?  maybe a add/remove or synaptic package source?
2007-04-27T07:59:00.000Z	eck	Och4	apt-get install mtools
2007-04-27T08:01:00.000Z	Och4	eck	does mtools have a gui? or terminal that bitch?
2007-04-27T08:02:00.000Z	eck	Och4	the program is command line

2007-04-27T08:02:00.000Z	Och4	eck	 does mtools got a gui or is it used through terminal?
2007-04-27T08:03:00.000Z	eck	Och4	terminal
2007-04-27T08:07:00.000Z	Och4	eck	how do i install mlabels, (in terminal) mtools>install mlabel?
2007-04-27T08:08:00.000Z	eck	Och4	no, the mtools package installs a bunch of different programs on your computer. one of those programs is called mtools, you just run it directly
2007-04-27T08:10:00.000Z	eck	Och4	that is correct
2007-04-27T08:11:00.000Z	Och4	eck	big thanks dude
