2010-02-05T23:54:00.000Z	jbwiv		guys, does anyone know if the Majic SysRq key is enabled on ubuntu by default? doesn't seem to be working on my end
2010-02-05T23:56:00.000Z	trism	jbwiv	it is set to y in the generic kernel config (and I know alt-sysrq-k works at least)
2010-02-05T23:56:00.000Z	jbwiv	trism	what's k do in this case? Is there an easy way for me to test without trying to reboot mymachine?
2010-02-05T23:57:00.000Z	trism	jbwiv	kills all processes on the current virtual console
2010-02-05T23:59:00.000Z	jbwiv	trism	including X sessions I see. Lol...it worked. thanks ;)
2012-07-20T22:48:00.000Z	trism	jbwiv	check System Settings/Keyboard/Shortcuts/System, it is disabled by default on non-unity sessions
2012-07-20T22:49:00.000Z	jbwiv	trism	it's not there. I'm in Unity (3d). what command should I map to restore it?
2012-07-20T22:49:00.000Z	jbwiv	trism	or is there a way to restore the defaults?
2012-07-20T22:50:00.000Z	trism	jbwiv	there is, unity --reset; which may help if your settings are messed up
2012-07-20T22:50:00.000Z	jbwiv	trism	I tried that, but to no avail
2012-07-20T22:54:00.000Z	trism	jbwiv	what it is configured to in ccsm/Unity/Key to execute a command?
2012-07-20T22:55:00.000Z	jbwiv	trism	<alt>F2
2012-07-20T22:56:00.000Z	jbwiv	trism	alt by itself pulls up the HUD, so I know the key is woriking
2012-07-20T22:57:00.000Z	trism	jbwiv	maybe something is conflicting with it? try changing it to something else and seeing if it comes up
2012-07-20T23:02:00.000Z	jbwiv	trism	odd...remapping it did indeed work. wonder how I'd go about tracking down the conflict?
2012-07-20T23:13:00.000Z	trism	jbwiv	not really sure, you could search ccsm in the advanced search section for f2 (checking the search in setting values box), but ccsm will usually warn on duplicate settings
2012-07-20T23:13:00.000Z	jbwiv	trism	ok, thanks for the help
2012-07-20T23:13:00.000Z	trism	jbwiv	otherwise, you may have installed something which grabs the keys before compiz gets them, but I'm not sure what that would be
2012-07-20T23:16:00.000Z	trism	jbwiv	I'm not really sure what you are asking, which popup? in ccsm? or the System Settings/Keyboard applet?
2012-07-20T23:17:00.000Z	trism	jbwiv	oh you mean the listing of shortcuts that pop up when you hold super
2012-07-20T23:17:00.000Z	trism	jbwiv	not sure, it doesn't appear on my netbook (I guess the screen is too small), I'll check my desktop
