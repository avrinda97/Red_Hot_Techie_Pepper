2006-04-21T05:57:00.000Z	Warbo	gwkw	You will still want to get that fixed but it's not major :)
2006-04-21T07:31:00.000Z	Warbo	gwkw	There is loads of conflicting stuff (like telnet)
2006-04-21T07:32:00.000Z	Warbo	gwkw	What is it you want to do? That is the main question. Installing stuff just because you can is stupid in Linux 'cause there's so much available
2006-04-21T07:34:00.000Z	Warbo	gwkw	from command line just use "sudo apt-get install --reinstall gaim" or similar
2006-04-21T07:38:00.000Z	Warbo	gwkw	No. Use the "install" bit like normal but "--reinstall" should make it reinstall. I'll just check the man page
2006-04-21T07:39:00.000Z	Warbo	gwkw	it is "--reinstall"
2006-04-21T07:40:00.000Z	Warbo	gwkw	Oh. Well don't listen then :)
2006-04-21T07:43:00.000Z	Warbo	gwkw	You're completely new? System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager
2006-04-21T07:44:00.000Z	Warbo	gwkw	By looking for the gaim package and reinstalling it it may fix your problem (I assume that's what you're trying to do?)
2006-04-21T07:44:00.000Z	Warbo	gwkw	And if not then "Completely remove" then install will regenerate knackered config files
2006-04-21T07:46:00.000Z	Warbo	gwkw	You OK, or need some more help?
2006-04-21T07:50:00.000Z	gwkw	Warbo	thanks !!:)
2006-04-21T07:50:00.000Z	Warbo	gwkw	My MSN buddies have pictures displayed by their names. Is that what you mean?
2006-04-21T10:31:00.000Z	Warbo	gwkw	Sorry, I don't do printers since mine ran out of ink
