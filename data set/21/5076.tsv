2008-01-02T23:41:00.000Z	Disastro		why is xubuntu so damn slow and how to make it faster?
2008-01-02T23:42:00.000Z	Disastro		800mhz 256mb ram
2008-01-02T23:42:00.000Z	Disastro		but ubuntu runs well
2008-01-02T23:42:00.000Z	Disastro		well... better
2008-01-02T23:43:00.000Z	Disastro		should it be that ubuntu is slower?
2008-01-02T23:44:00.000Z	zenobius	Disastro	how odd...it should be the other way round
2008-01-02T23:46:00.000Z	zenobius	Disastro	LOL, get rid of nautilus
2008-01-02T23:46:00.000Z	zenobius	Disastro	sudo killall nautilus -9
2008-01-02T23:47:00.000Z	zenobius	Disastro	i have my old man running xubuntu
2008-01-02T23:53:00.000Z	zenobius	Disastro	best you can do is get folders to 'open with thunar...'
2008-01-02T23:54:00.000Z	zenobius	Disastro	do you need nautilus?
2008-01-02T23:54:00.000Z	zenobius	Disastro	have alook in your session manager gui
2008-01-02T23:56:00.000Z	Disastro	zenobius	where?
2008-01-02T23:57:00.000Z	zenobius	Disastro	should be under your system menu
2008-01-02T23:57:00.000Z	zenobius	Disastro	im not running xfce desktop here , so cant reality check on the fly.
2008-01-03T00:01:00.000Z	Disastro	zenobius	what program is trackerd?
2008-01-03T00:01:00.000Z	zenobius	Disastro	a search and indexing thing, much better than beagle
2008-01-03T00:01:00.000Z	zenobius	Disastro	but still a drain
2008-01-03T00:02:00.000Z	zenobius	Disastro	if you dont need that kind of thing remove it all together "sudo apt-get remove trackerd tacker-search-tool'
2008-01-03T00:06:00.000Z	zenobius	Disastro	trackerd is started before login screen sometime.
2008-01-03T00:07:00.000Z	zenobius	Disastro	its not essential
