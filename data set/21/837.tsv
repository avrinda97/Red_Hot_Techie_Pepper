2011-05-19T17:17:00.000Z	prashant_123456		can some one tell me the right way to configure dsl connection via network manager gui ??
2011-05-19T17:17:00.000Z	theadmin	prashant_123456	What kind of DSL? pppoe?
2011-05-19T17:17:00.000Z	prashant_123456	theadmin	yep
2011-05-19T17:18:00.000Z	prashant_123456	theadmin	pppoe
2011-05-19T17:18:00.000Z	theadmin	prashant_123456	Use pppoe-setup, networkmanager is broken there
2011-05-19T17:19:00.000Z	prashant_123456	theadmin	when i connect using pppoeconf everywebpage loads very great but when i use network manage to connect the internet some webpages dont display like mail.yahoo.co.in ????
2011-05-19T17:20:00.000Z	theadmin	prashant_123456	As I said, networkmanager's DSL is BROKEN. Don't use that.
2011-05-19T17:20:00.000Z	prashant_123456	theadmin	when i use pppoeconf sometimes i dont get connected to internet dont know why
2011-05-19T17:20:00.000Z	prashant_123456	theadmin	 when i connect using pppoeconf everywebpage loads very great but when i use network manage to connect the internet some webpages dont display like mail.yahoo.co.in ????
2011-05-19T17:21:00.000Z	theadmin	prashant_123456	I replied already. NetworkManager's PPPOE capability is broken.
2011-05-19T17:22:00.000Z	prashant_123456	theadmin	but when i get connected to pppoeconf the command line way like pon dsl-provider sometimes i dont get connected ????
2011-05-19T17:22:00.000Z	theadmin	prashant_123456	Probably a provider problem
2011-05-19T17:22:00.000Z	prashant_123456	theadmin	but when i connect via network manager internet is good
2011-05-19T17:22:00.000Z	prashant_123456	theadmin	no problem but have some problem with some websites only
2011-05-19T17:23:00.000Z	theadmin	prashant_123456	Okay, that's odd. I have a router which does the connection for me so I dunno
2011-05-19T17:23:00.000Z	prashant_123456	theadmin	thanks
