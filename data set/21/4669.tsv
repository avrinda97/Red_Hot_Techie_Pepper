2008-12-31T23:37:00.000Z	ikonia	manning_	what command are you using
2008-12-31T23:38:00.000Z	ikonia	manning_	thats not the right command
2008-12-31T23:38:00.000Z	ikonia	manning_	it's mount $disk_device $mount_point
2008-12-31T23:38:00.000Z	ikonia	manning_	man mount shows you the mount option
2008-12-31T23:39:00.000Z	ikonia	manning_	disk is not a mount point
2008-12-31T23:39:00.000Z	ikonia	manning_	where do you want to mount it
2008-12-31T23:41:00.000Z	manning_	ikonia	ok, using /media/disk it gave me the same 'fuse: failed to access mountpoint disk: No such file or directory'     - sorry if i'm a little thickheaded. still a little new to this yet.
2008-12-31T23:41:00.000Z	ikonia	manning_	show me the EXACT command you used please
2008-12-31T23:42:00.000Z	manning_	ikonia	sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/disk
2008-12-31T23:42:00.000Z	ikonia	manning_	sudo mkdir /media/disk
2008-12-31T23:42:00.000Z	ikonia	manning_	then try it

2008-12-31T23:44:00.000Z	ikonia	manning_	sli doesn't work properly
2008-12-31T23:44:00.000Z	ikonia	manning_	it's better to run it as two cards seperatly
2008-12-31T23:44:00.000Z	manning_	ikonia	even with nvidia drivers?
2008-12-31T23:44:00.000Z	ikonia	manning_	yup, sli support is super poor
2008-12-31T23:45:00.000Z	manning_	ikonia	oh bummer.. ok. thanks :)
