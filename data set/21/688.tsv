2012-06-30T11:57:00.000Z	phii-tard		hey all
2012-06-30T11:57:00.000Z	phii-tard		having all sorts of hilarious problems with wine
2012-06-30T11:58:00.000Z	phii-tard		for example, in fullscreen games (and sometimes other applications...Ableton Live, for example) i don't get any keyboard input
2012-06-30T11:59:00.000Z	phii-tard		no, i assure you, it's an ubuntu issue.
2012-06-30T11:59:00.000Z	auronandace	phii-tard	are you using unity?
2012-06-30T12:00:00.000Z	phii-tard		unity2D
2012-06-30T12:00:00.000Z	phii-tard		but the issue persists in e17 and xfce
2012-06-30T12:00:00.000Z	auronandace	phii-tard	then it sounds like a wine issue
2012-06-30T12:01:00.000Z	phii-tard		the wine answer is always "alt-tab out and back"
2012-06-30T12:02:00.000Z	phii-tard		which would be great if the wine "window" actually appeared in the alt-tab switcher, but it doesn't. (well, Ableton does, but switching focus back and forth doesn't fix it)
2012-06-30T12:03:00.000Z	auronandace	phii-tard	check the appdb
2012-06-30T12:03:00.000Z	phii-tard		it's not a specific application that does it, though. it's ANY fullscreen DirectX application.
2012-06-30T12:04:00.000Z	auronandace	phii-tard	run winecfg and make the fullscreen app use an emulated desktop size
2012-06-30T12:06:00.000Z	phii-tard		obviously, i've looked through the appdb for the specific apps i've had the issue with. and i've asked google. i'm not the type to run and ask a grown-up for help with something i could fix by reading other people's mis-spelled forum posts. everybody else has it cured with alt-tab. or has a slightly different problem.
2012-06-30T12:06:00.000Z	phii-tard		d'oh!
2012-06-30T12:08:00.000Z	phii-tard		that fixes it, but it runs in a window. and a directx window rendering 3d graphics doesn't play nice sat on top of unity.
2012-06-30T12:10:00.000Z	auronandace	phii-tard	unless you are using compiz or kwin with effects turned on then there shouldn't be a problem with fullscreen apps in wine
2012-06-30T12:11:00.000Z	auronandace	phii-tard	unity2d uses metacity so i'd expect it should work (never tried though)
2012-06-30T12:12:00.000Z	phii-tard		i know there shouldn't. that's why i'm on irc whining about it instead of playing Thief: The Dark Project.
2012-06-30T12:16:00.000Z	phii-tard	ghostchick2013	how do i do that?
2012-06-30T12:18:00.000Z	auronandace	phii-tard	i have a silly question: is your graphics card up to spec for the game (and drivers installed)
