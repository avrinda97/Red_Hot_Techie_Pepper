2006-04-23T15:58:00.000Z	spikeb		well
2006-04-23T15:58:00.000Z	spikeb		that's fine
2006-04-23T15:58:00.000Z	spikeb		it's just a gaming box :P
2006-04-23T16:00:00.000Z	spikeb		you can
2006-04-23T16:00:00.000Z	spikeb		heh
2006-04-23T16:00:00.000Z	spikeb		nvidia and ati both have onboard stuff as well
2006-04-23T16:01:00.000Z	spikeb		though i dont know how well supported the ati stuff is
2006-04-23T16:03:00.000Z	spikeb		nvidia's nforce stuff is supported now i believe. not bad stuff.
2006-04-23T16:03:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spikeb	the consensus seems to be that nvidia's linux drivers are significantly better for 3d than ati's
2006-04-23T16:04:00.000Z	spikeb	Frogzoo	that's true.
2006-04-23T16:04:00.000Z	spikeb	Frogzoo	they can't be any worse, i speak from experience with ATI drivers.
2006-06-01T08:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spikeb	stop - you'll grind your teeth down
2006-06-02T10:09:00.000Z	spikeb	Frogzoo	do you have restricted format support?
2006-06-02T10:13:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spikeb	according to the !restricted, you need gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly  which I do have installed
2006-06-02T10:13:00.000Z	spikeb	Frogzoo	you need libxine-extracodecs, i think amarok uses xine by default now
2006-06-02T10:15:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spikeb	ah, d/ling now - might update the wiki if this fixes it...
2006-06-02T10:42:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spikeb	that worked - thx a bunch
2006-06-07T11:33:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spikeb	mkswap first though
2006-06-10T12:01:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spikeb	ubunut.org
2006-06-10T12:02:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spikeb	actually ubunut.com
2007-06-03T05:49:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spikeb	iptables is there, you need to configure it
