2005-11-03T12:11:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	What video card do you have?
2005-11-03T12:12:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	Can you log in on a text console?
2005-11-03T12:12:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	Run "lspci" from the console.
2005-11-03T12:14:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	Okay, one sec.
2005-11-03T12:14:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	Indeed. :)
2005-11-03T12:16:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	Do:
2005-11-03T12:16:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	My guess is the board does "video memory sharing" with the system, so it should be able to steal that much RAM without any problem.
2005-11-03T12:17:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	Question? :)
2005-11-03T12:17:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	"x server hyphen x org"
2005-11-03T12:17:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	Two 'x's.
2005-11-03T12:18:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	Yeah, that should be fine.
2005-11-03T12:19:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	/etc/init.d/gdm restart
2005-11-03T12:33:00.000Z	Turner	paulproteus	I just rebooted and went into my bios and loaded optimized defaults
2005-11-03T12:33:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	Well, that's good.
2005-11-03T12:33:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	Good to have that nonsense over. :)
2005-11-03T12:46:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	Use smbmount; that makes it easy.
2005-11-03T12:48:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	Good; was about to point you to it.
2005-11-03T12:51:00.000Z	paulproteus	Turner	Glad to hear it. :)
