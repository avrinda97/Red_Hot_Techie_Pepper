2011-10-17T20:58:00.000Z	kibet	arghx	trust me it exists
2011-10-17T20:58:00.000Z	arghx	kibet	you cannot "remove" grub. all you can do is overwrite it with another bootloader
2011-10-17T21:03:00.000Z	kibet	arghx	the only one offtopic here is you, im totally dissapointed with ubuntu updater, and you are telling me its not an ubuntu issue
2011-10-17T20:59:00.000Z	arghx	kibet	what bootloader do you want instead of grub then?
2011-10-17T20:59:00.000Z	kibet	arghx	grub-LEGACY
2011-10-17T21:00:00.000Z	kibet	arghx	not the freaking stupid version of it
2011-10-17T21:00:00.000Z	arghx	kibet	and what is your actual problem with that?
2011-10-17T21:01:00.000Z	kibet	arghx	it never worked for me, and its about 1005125396802938^10^100 times more difficult to debug than grub-legacy
2011-10-17T21:01:00.000Z	arghx	kibet	I asked you what your problem with using grub-legacy is
2011-10-17T21:01:00.000Z	kibet	arghx	grub-legacy is FINE
2011-10-17T21:02:00.000Z	kibet	arghx	grub 2 bricks my system every time
2011-10-17T21:02:00.000Z	arghx	kibet	if you have no actual ubuntu support problem, please be quiet in here and don't spam. thank you
2011-10-17T21:02:00.000Z	kibet	arghx	are you freaking kidding me
2011-10-17T21:02:00.000Z	kibet	arghx	ubuntu updater made that mistake
2011-10-17T21:02:00.000Z	kibet	arghx	ubuntu channels are gonna fix it
2011-10-17T21:04:00.000Z	arghx	kibet	talking about bootloaders and such is OT yes, as you said you have no support problem with your bootloader
2011-10-17T21:04:00.000Z	kibet	arghx	Double facepalm for you sir, didnt i just say it BRICKED my system and i need to REMOVE it in order to boot BACK again?
2011-10-17T21:04:00.000Z	kibet	arghx	where did you get lost?
2011-10-17T21:05:00.000Z	arghx	kibet	you can create a new user and use that user's config files or home directory
2011-10-17T21:05:00.000Z	arghx	kibet	can you please stop talking to me?
2011-10-17T21:05:00.000Z	kibet	arghx	you dont make sense -- so same goes to you
