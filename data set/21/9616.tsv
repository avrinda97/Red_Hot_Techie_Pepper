2005-08-27T10:27:00.000Z	uthini		i'm having a wierd error with cedega
2005-08-27T10:27:00.000Z	uthini		well point to play actually
2005-08-27T10:27:00.000Z	kemik	uthini	 #cedega may be of better help
2005-08-27T10:28:00.000Z	uthini	kemik	its more of a linux issue tho
2005-08-27T10:29:00.000Z	kemik	uthini	 i assume you have a /dev/hdc then? try "sudo fdsik -l"
2005-08-27T10:31:00.000Z	uthini	kemik	all i have is /dev/hda & /dev/hdb
2005-08-27T10:33:00.000Z	kemik	uthini	 well that'd be a problem
2005-08-27T10:36:00.000Z	kemik	uthini	 your cdrom?
2005-08-28T06:03:00.000Z	kemik	uthini	 you should use the binary-drivers though.. there are how'to's for Nvidia and Ati.. (i assuming that's one of those brands you've got? )
2005-08-28T06:04:00.000Z	kemik	uthini	will come back im guessing.. with lots of troubles
2005-08-30T05:59:00.000Z	kemik	uthini	 fdisk
2005-08-30T06:00:00.000Z	uthini	kemik	i don't see a format option, i've changed the partitions, but its still an ntfs drive
2005-08-30T06:01:00.000Z	kemik	uthini	 oh. format =)
2005-08-30T06:03:00.000Z	uthini	kemik	when i tupe format is tjoons no such command?
2005-08-30T06:03:00.000Z	kemik	uthini	 i didnt mena "format" as the command rather "oh, you were asking about formatting" sorry for the confusion =)
2005-08-30T06:05:00.000Z	uthini	kemik	what is the format command? i know it exists!! i have my partition info setup already
2005-08-30T06:06:00.000Z	kemik	uthini	 i think you'd want to use "mkfs"
2005-08-30T06:06:00.000Z	kemik	uthini	 or fill the partition with 0's usgin "dd"
2005-08-30T06:08:00.000Z	kemik	uthini	 mkfs  is  used  to  build  a  Linux  file system on a device, usually a hard disk partition.
2005-08-30T06:09:00.000Z	kemik	uthini	 i'd go for "sudo -t filesystemtype<ntfs,vfat,ext3> /dev/hdb1"   and that would probably give you a partition with the FS you want...
2005-08-30T13:29:00.000Z	kemik	uthini	 possibly bu getting a recoverytool . but they're expensive
