2006-04-12T09:59:00.000Z	hewhe		i -dont- want to install lots of useless packets.. ubuntu-desktop would perhaps do it, but there are trillions of useless programs there

2006-04-12T10:04:00.000Z	hewhe		i dont have x11r6 installed. do i really need the x server to run graphics on -other- computers?
2006-04-12T10:05:00.000Z	goofrider	hewhe	yes u do. Even the graphics is shown on another computer, the code is still executed there
