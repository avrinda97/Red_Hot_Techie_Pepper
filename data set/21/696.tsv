2011-12-21T15:09:00.000Z	TiMiDo		it should look right click on the clock and see if you have an option to change the design of it
2011-12-21T15:10:00.000Z	TiMiDo		tell me about it i was having issues with hp 620
2011-12-21T15:10:00.000Z	faint545	TiMiDo	all there is, is preferences and that allows you to change the format of the time displayed, like display seconds or whatever
2011-12-21T15:10:00.000Z	TiMiDo	faint545	so what's your question to change the time?
2011-12-21T15:11:00.000Z	TiMiDo		is that what you are asking?
2011-12-21T15:11:00.000Z	faint545	TiMiDo	the picture link i posted.... http://i44.tinypic.com/wlx65c.png the clock text is all messed up
2011-12-21T15:12:00.000Z	faint545	TiMiDo	i used these directions to get a custom background for my panel.. http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/02/gnome-panel-transparency-fix-ubuntu/
2011-12-21T15:12:00.000Z	TiMiDo		let me take a look at it
2011-12-21T15:12:00.000Z	faint545	TiMiDo	and after that, the clock looks like crap.
2011-12-21T15:13:00.000Z	TiMiDo		then open it back up
2011-12-21T15:13:00.000Z	TiMiDo		and edit where you edit the file.
2011-12-21T15:13:00.000Z	TiMiDo		gksu gedit /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
2011-12-21T15:14:00.000Z	faint545	TiMiDo	so r u saying to undo my changes? i dont want to do that
2011-12-21T15:15:00.000Z	TiMiDo		yeah faint545
2011-12-21T15:16:00.000Z	faint545	TiMiDo	that isnt my goal
2011-12-21T15:16:00.000Z	TiMiDo	faint545	if you're goal is something else try reading some gtk tutorial for themes and much more.
