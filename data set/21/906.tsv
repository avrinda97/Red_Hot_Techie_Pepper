2011-04-23T00:54:00.000Z	ohzie	xstarslayer	prepend is to put in front of, in this case "sudo apt-get"
2011-04-23T00:58:00.000Z	ohzie	xstarslayer	You should try to not forget your password next time. :(
2011-04-23T01:04:00.000Z	ohzie	xstarslayer	if you don't get a chance to press enter, your keyboard might be sticking.
2011-04-23T01:05:00.000Z	ohzie	xstarslayer	The system asks you for a password, you put in your password and hit enter. If it's tell you wrong password, only a few things can be happening
2011-04-23T01:06:00.000Z	ohzie	xstarslayer	1)You forgot your password 2)Your keyboard is jacked up
