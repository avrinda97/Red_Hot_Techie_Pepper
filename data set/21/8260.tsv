2007-10-31T21:19:00.000Z	anna		that is not true Linux Mint is way better then Ubuntu
2007-10-31T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	anna	thats personal opinion
2008-07-06T15:36:00.000Z	ikonia	anna	grub doesn't touch your file system
2008-07-06T15:37:00.000Z	anna	ikonia	Well, ok... but I can't mount it anymore.
2008-07-06T15:37:00.000Z	ikonia	anna	what happens when you try to mount it ?
2008-07-06T15:38:00.000Z	ikonia	anna	specify a file system type then, what file system is on it ?
2008-07-06T15:39:00.000Z	anna	ikonia	You think it only killed a boot sector or something like that, right?
2008-07-06T15:39:00.000Z	ikonia	anna	yes, it should only write to the mbr - nothing more
2008-07-06T15:39:00.000Z	anna	ikonia	A partition has a MBR  too?
2008-07-06T15:39:00.000Z	ikonia	anna	sort of
2008-07-06T15:39:00.000Z	ikonia	anna	what disk was it ?
2008-07-06T15:39:00.000Z	anna	ikonia	Cause I did install to the partition
2008-07-06T15:39:00.000Z	ikonia	anna	as in what device
2008-07-06T15:40:00.000Z	anna	ikonia	/dev/sda1
2008-07-06T15:40:00.000Z	ikonia	anna	what does "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda" show
2008-07-06T15:40:00.000Z	anna	ikonia	That one looks unchanged, still NTFS partition
2008-07-06T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	anna	so thats a reasonable sign, so just sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt
