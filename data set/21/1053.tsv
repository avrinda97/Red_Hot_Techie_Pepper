2011-08-30T05:43:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow	pidgin also has very poor handling of large IRC rooms, such as this one
2011-08-30T05:45:00.000Z	silverarrow	gaelfx	nick spell error
2011-08-30T05:45:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow	not a problem, not sure what you mean by red text function though
2011-08-30T05:45:00.000Z	silverarrow	gaelfx	though I might not know the finer points of xchat
2011-08-30T05:46:00.000Z	silverarrow	gaelfx	you know, address post with nick and it gets red in the receiver end
2011-08-30T05:47:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow	I'm fairly certain that most any modern IRC client can highlight posts directed at you ;)
2011-08-30T05:48:00.000Z	silverarrow	gaelfx	I'm in pidgin right now, I don't get any red highlighted text nick or no nick
2011-08-30T05:49:00.000Z	silverarrow	gaelfx	though nicks are given different colors, so fairly easy to follow two or three people's conversation
2011-08-30T05:56:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow	yeah, but pidgin does highlight it when I send you messages, right?
2011-08-30T05:57:00.000Z	silverarrow	gaelfx	no, unfortunately
2011-08-30T05:57:00.000Z	silverarrow	gaelfx	your nick is in sort of a mustard color, thats it, text standard
2011-08-30T05:57:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow	that's very strange, because it always did that for me
2011-08-30T05:59:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow	yeah, that's basically highlighted
2011-08-30T06:00:00.000Z	silverarrow	gaelfx	yes, but it is mustard color whom ever you adress, so not that in your face red
2011-08-30T06:01:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow	there's probably someplace you can change that color
2011-08-30T06:01:00.000Z	silverarrow	gaelfx	 when missing a cup of coffee, i might need the red fist lol
2011-08-30T06:02:00.000Z	silverarrow	gaelfx	well colors are sort of random, restart and you might be pink
2011-08-30T06:02:00.000Z	gaelfx	silverarrow	I think the highlighting is always the same color
2011-08-30T06:03:00.000Z	silverarrow	gaelfx	,write something with out my nick
2011-08-30T06:03:00.000Z	silverarrow	gaelfx	for experiment I mean
2011-08-30T06:06:00.000Z	silverarrow	gaelfx	I think the nick goes in fat types, as highlighted
