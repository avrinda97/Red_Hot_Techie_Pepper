2010-08-07T08:26:00.000Z	look		im in Ubuntu 10.04 and I have a wifi card (wlan0) when i 'iwlist scan' it shows that the network is down but when i do 'ifconfig wlan0 up' it says there is no such directoy, it sees my card but wont let it turn on for some odd reason, and yes it is "turn on" on my laptop but ubuntu says its not. Any thing i can do about this?
