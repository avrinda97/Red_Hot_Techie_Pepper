2010-05-09T13:59:00.000Z	Susanne	renata	so there are your 7 partitions.
2010-05-09T13:59:00.000Z	Susanne	renata	what do you want to do?
2010-05-09T13:59:00.000Z	renata	Susanne	i want them to be available somewhere always. I dont know how to do that
2010-05-09T14:00:00.000Z	Susanne	renata	which one do you want available?
2010-05-09T14:01:00.000Z	renata	Susanne	I want sda2 and sda5 to be available
2010-05-09T14:02:00.000Z	Susanne	renata	try this: mkdir /mnt/sda2; mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/sda2; ls /mnt/sda2
2010-05-09T14:02:00.000Z	renata	Susanne	all this in one line in terminal?
2010-05-09T14:03:00.000Z	Susanne	renata	you can do it in one line or do every command on its own. it doesnt make a difference. the ; just divides the commands.
2010-05-09T14:06:00.000Z	renata	Susanne	Ok, thanks, I can find that! however there seems to a problem wih encoding. It does not show my lithuanian fonts on folder names...
2010-05-09T14:07:00.000Z	Susanne	renata	ls shows lithuanian fonts in other directories?
2010-05-09T14:08:00.000Z	renata	Susanne	when I open /mnt/sda2 I have my folders listed, however, there are question marks instead of lithuanian letters
2010-05-09T14:09:00.000Z	Susanne	renata	when you "open it" - what does that mean?
2010-05-09T14:09:00.000Z	renata		in thunar (I use xubuntu
2010-05-09T14:10:00.000Z	renata	Susanne	In thunar (I use Xubuntu)
2010-05-09T14:13:00.000Z	renata	Susanne	btw, will I have to write the same lines again every boot, or will I have these partitions automatically now?
2010-05-09T14:13:00.000Z	Susanne	renata	you can unmount the partition with "umount /mnt/sda2" and then try to mount it with options for encoding. do "man mount" it has some infos on this. maybe "mount -o utf8 /dev/sda2 /mnt/sda2" or "mount -o isocharset=utf8 /dev/sda2 /mnt/sda2" will do the right thing?
2010-05-09T14:15:00.000Z	Susanne	renata	"mkdir /mnt/sda2" created a directory "/mnt/sda2" that will still be there after reboot. "mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/sda2" mounted the partition. that will be gone after reboot. you can do it again after reboot. there also is some config file in ubuntu with a list of partitions to mount on startup. i forgot which one, but other people will know.
2010-05-09T14:15:00.000Z	renata	Susanne	thanks
