2008-07-29T17:38:00.000Z	x3		and it accepts the correct IP same as you would get on xp?
2008-07-29T17:38:00.000Z	x3		and so on with subnetmask and dnd
2008-07-29T17:38:00.000Z	x3		I mean your router assigns a IP to xp
2008-07-29T17:39:00.000Z	x3		if on linux is your on same machine you shoukld get same UIP
2008-07-29T17:39:00.000Z	x3		and your getting same IP
2008-07-29T17:40:00.000Z	x3		on both xpp and linux??
2008-07-29T17:40:00.000Z	x3		is there a way to do file tranfer via RDP in ubuntu or not someone please know the answer
2008-07-29T17:40:00.000Z	x3		ip
2008-07-29T17:40:00.000Z	x3		e.g. 192.168.2.100
2008-07-29T17:41:00.000Z	hyperair	x3	no here isn't. since when was there file transfer via rdp?
2008-07-29T17:42:00.000Z	hyperair	x3	rdp is purely for remote desktop
2008-07-29T17:42:00.000Z	hyperair	x3	no file transfer
2008-07-29T17:46:00.000Z	hyperair	x3	if you notice the ifconfig output, there is no eth0, eth1, ath0, wlan0 or whatever
2008-07-29T17:47:00.000Z	hyperair	x3	there is only lo
2008-07-29T17:47:00.000Z	hyperair	x3	do you udnerstand what that means?
2008-07-29T17:47:00.000Z	hyperair	x3	linux did not detect any network cards/interfaces
2008-07-29T17:47:00.000Z	hyperair	x3	that is why there is only lo, which is the loopback device
2008-07-29T17:50:00.000Z	hyperair	x3	what is PEBKAC?
2008-07-29T17:51:00.000Z	hyperair	x3	nevermind i know now. you know what? please shut up.
2008-07-29T17:51:00.000Z	hyperair	x3	you obviously can't differentiate a PEBKAC case and a genuine problem
