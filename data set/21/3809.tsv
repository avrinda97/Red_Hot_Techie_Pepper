2009-11-07T06:47:00.000Z	Swian		ok, I've downloaded all the gstreamer codecs in the repository and I still can't play dvds
2009-11-07T06:47:00.000Z	Swian		any ideas?
2009-11-07T06:48:00.000Z	Swian		thanks DasEi will try
2009-11-07T06:49:00.000Z	DasEi	Swian	vlc brings all (propitary) codecs itself
2009-11-07T06:49:00.000Z	Swian	DasEi	I had already downloaded vlc, but it didn't work
2009-11-07T06:50:00.000Z	DasEi	Swian	common dvds ?
2009-11-07T06:51:00.000Z	DasEi	Swian	vlc > open medium > choose dvd 'n drive ?!
2009-11-07T06:54:00.000Z	DasEi	Swian	tried that another comp ?
2009-11-07T06:56:00.000Z	Swian	DasEi	no error message, just closes
2009-11-07T06:57:00.000Z	Swian	DasEi	the drive works fine, I have this as dual boot and it works in Windows and worked fine last week with 9.04
2009-11-07T06:57:00.000Z	DasEi	Swian	run vlc from trml to see error outp.
2009-11-07T06:58:00.000Z	DasEi	Swian	like: vlc /dev/scd0
2009-11-07T07:01:00.000Z	DasEi	Swian	what do you get from trml ?
2009-11-07T07:06:00.000Z	DasEi	Swian	http://tinyurl.com/ylcc4c6  , though strange to me
2009-11-07T07:10:00.000Z	Swian	DasEi	- nope, that didn't work either, I think some of the codecs may be corrupt or incomplete how I can do a reinstall?
2009-11-07T07:12:00.000Z	DasEi	Swian	I don't think so, it'll be rather a problem with permissions or changed places, vlc brings everything by default, some more tries :
2009-11-07T07:12:00.000Z	DasEi	Swian	sudo apt-get update  && sudo apt-get upgrade
2009-11-07T07:13:00.000Z	DasEi	Swian	check if your non-root user is allowed in audio and access of the dvd-drive
2009-11-07T07:14:00.000Z	Swian	DasEi	how do I do that?
2009-11-07T07:15:00.000Z	DasEi	Swian	system, administration, user n groups ..
2009-11-07T07:16:00.000Z	DasEi	Swian	: or so
