2006-12-23T10:37:00.000Z	un_operateur	zzzerotime	we dont advocate automatix in here -- its not a good thing to use
2006-12-23T10:37:00.000Z	un_operateur	zzzerotime	read up there ^^^
2006-12-23T10:38:00.000Z	un_operateur	zzzerotime	it works until your system has a problem -- and then its a nightmare troubleshooting -- and thats why we dont recommend it
2006-12-23T10:39:00.000Z	un_operateur	zzzerotime	there is no compilation with automatix, what are you talking about?
2006-12-23T10:42:00.000Z	zzzerotime	un_operateur	sorry to recommend automatix, for me it worked very good, but to be honest, ubuntu does not really need it,
2006-12-23T10:42:00.000Z	un_operateur	zzzerotime	the reason we dont advocate automatix is because the number of problems arising from the use of it is high -- and it's better to avoid it if is an unstable application -- prevention is better than cure and all that..
2006-12-23T10:43:00.000Z	un_operateur	zzzerotime	exactly what we say too -- you can have a perfect setup without automatix
2006-12-23T10:43:00.000Z	zzzerotime	un_operateur	ok I get the idea
2006-12-23T10:44:00.000Z	un_operateur	zzzerotime	you could try thoreauputic's suggestiong -- sudo sh -c "aptitude purge nautilus ubuntu-desktop; aptitude install nautilus"
2006-12-23T10:44:00.000Z	zzzerotime	un_operateur	?
2006-12-24T07:30:00.000Z	zzzerotime	un_operateur	do you know what program to use to record analog tv?
2006-12-24T07:31:00.000Z	un_operateur	zzzerotime	errm, dunno --- mythtv maybe?
2006-12-24T07:32:00.000Z	zzzerotime	un_operateur	I tried to install it, but I think it will record just dvb
2006-12-24T07:32:00.000Z	un_operateur	zzzerotime	i wouldnt know -- multimedia isnt one of my fortes
2006-12-24T07:33:00.000Z	zzzerotime	un_operateur	 is there any one that you know who could help me out?
2006-12-24T07:33:00.000Z	un_operateur	zzzerotime	errm, google suggest -- try him out at http://labs.google.com/suggest :)
