2006-08-03T06:56:00.000Z	hoehaver		oo ok....
2006-08-03T06:56:00.000Z	gdb	hoehaver	On the samba server, you need to run the following command: "smbpasswd -a your_username" and then enter the password there.  You also need to ensure that the folder you want to mount is shared either using System > Administration > Shared Folders or by editing /etc/samba/smb.conf directly and restarting samba (/etc/init.d/samba restart).
2006-08-03T06:58:00.000Z	hoehaver	gdb	: so if my password was 123 i would type   smbpasswd -a 123
2006-08-03T06:58:00.000Z	hoehaver		??
2006-08-03T06:58:00.000Z	gdb	hoehaver	No, you type "smbpasswd -a hoehaver" (assuming that's your username).
2006-08-03T06:58:00.000Z	gdb	hoehaver	That will add user hoehaver to the smbpasswd file.
2006-08-03T06:59:00.000Z	hoehaver		oo....ok i got mixed up
2006-08-03T06:59:00.000Z	hoehaver		sorry
2006-08-03T06:59:00.000Z	hoehaver		but thank you
2006-08-03T07:00:00.000Z	hoehaver	gdb	: thank man...really
2006-08-03T07:01:00.000Z	hoehaver		you have no idea how long i have been fuc**ng with this sh*t
2006-08-03T07:01:00.000Z	gdb	hoehaver	It's not intuitive that there is additional configuration necessary after installing samba.
