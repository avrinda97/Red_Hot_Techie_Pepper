2006-12-27T10:28:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	blazemonger	Loaded question.
2006-12-27T11:11:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	blazemonger	Hence the name "edgy". If you want something stable and reliable, use Dapper.
2006-12-27T11:13:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	blazemonger	What were your major problems with Ubuntu?
2006-12-27T11:14:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	blazemonger	Perhaps I can suggest an alternate distro. What were your issues with Ubuntu?
2006-12-27T11:17:00.000Z	blazemonger	Munchkinguy	any reccomendations? Mandriva? Fedora?
2006-12-27T11:18:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	blazemonger	The problem seems to be that you want stable and cutting edge at the same time.
2006-12-27T11:18:00.000Z	blazemonger	Munchkinguy	slackware needs some updated compilers
2006-12-27T11:19:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	blazemonger	If you don't mind KDE, you can use the "Other Debian that works (besides Ubuntu)"
2006-12-27T11:20:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	blazemonger	Freespire
2006-12-27T11:21:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	blazemonger	Never said that.
2006-12-27T11:22:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	blazemonger	Debian stable is apparently excellent, it's just old.
