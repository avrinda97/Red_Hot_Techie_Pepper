2005-01-29T16:14:00.000Z	Neo_654	jaco	couldn't you just put the smb hostname in a host file?
2005-01-29T16:15:00.000Z	jaco	Neo_654	with warthy it has worked without any problem
2005-01-29T16:15:00.000Z	jaco		with hoary i can't see the list
2005-01-29T16:15:00.000Z	jaco		i dunno why
2005-01-29T16:15:00.000Z	jaco		in my network ther r 170 pc i don't want write their name in an host file
2005-01-29T16:16:00.000Z	Neo_654	jaco	ok I was getting tired of the slowness when surfing so I had to dig deep to speed up the dns.
2005-01-29T16:16:00.000Z	Neo_654	jaco	well that does make since.  With that many don't you have one running dns?
2005-01-29T16:17:00.000Z	jaco		no it's unnecessary with a windows based network
2005-01-29T16:17:00.000Z	jaco		and also with warty is unnecessary
2005-01-29T16:17:00.000Z	jaco		it works
2005-01-29T16:17:00.000Z	jaco		with hoary i can't see the list
2005-01-29T16:17:00.000Z	Neo_654	jaco	thats strange.  My 2k3 wasn't being seen so I had to set it.
2005-01-29T16:18:00.000Z	jaco	Neo_654	mmm i dunno, with my first installation the windows network was discovered without problems
