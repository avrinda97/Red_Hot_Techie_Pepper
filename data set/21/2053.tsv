2010-02-03T05:49:00.000Z	zealot		you will have to use the propietary drivrs
2010-02-03T05:49:00.000Z	ectraz		i know :p thats the problem
2010-02-03T05:49:00.000Z	zealot		whats wrong
2010-02-03T05:50:00.000Z	zealot		are the propietary drivers not working
2010-02-03T05:50:00.000Z	zealot		be sure to blacklist the linux drivers
2010-02-03T05:50:00.000Z	zealot		if you are going to use the propietary drivers
2010-02-03T05:50:00.000Z	ectraz		Zealot, I have no idea is there a way of testing? havent touched the drivers
2010-02-03T05:50:00.000Z	zealot		well go on the ati website and get the linux drivers for your card
2010-02-03T05:51:00.000Z	zealot		and install them
2010-02-03T05:51:00.000Z	ectraz		ive done that, wount install due to incompatible version
2010-02-03T05:51:00.000Z	zealot		incompatible version?
2010-02-03T05:51:00.000Z	zealot		did you get the right drivers?
2010-02-03T05:51:00.000Z	zealot		because linux is linux
2010-02-03T05:51:00.000Z	zealot		the drivers should support 2.6 kernel
2010-02-03T05:51:00.000Z	ectraz		Error: ./default_policy.sh does not support version
2010-02-03T05:52:00.000Z	zealot		are you sure thats the right script to install
2010-02-03T05:52:00.000Z	zealot		that doenst look like an install script
2010-02-03T05:52:00.000Z	ectraz	zealot	just following the guide from ATI website
