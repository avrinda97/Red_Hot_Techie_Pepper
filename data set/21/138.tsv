2012-08-09T09:21:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	Do you at least see BIOS when booting?
2012-08-09T09:22:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	That means a lot. Does anything show up before it tries to boot the live cd/usb?
2012-08-09T09:23:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	I'm not familiar with UEFI, so I'm probably not much help. If it's similar to BIOS in having a key to press to get to the settings, it should show it when booting.
2012-08-09T09:23:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	So when you boot your computer, all you get is the cursor? NOTHING else shows?
2012-08-09T09:23:00.000Z	zack68491	KatsumeBlisk	it has the press the key to change boot settings and whatnot, yes
2012-08-09T09:24:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	K. I'm assuming you chose USB or w/e your Ubuntu media is as the first option?
2012-08-09T09:24:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	Just trying to figure out how far you can get. :)
2012-08-09T09:25:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	Were you using a CD or USB?
2012-08-09T09:25:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	Make a USB, then we'll go from there.
2012-08-09T09:27:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	You should plug it in. :)
2012-08-09T09:27:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	Ahh.
2012-08-09T09:27:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	never mind
2012-08-09T09:28:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	What OS and application did you try to make the USB with?
2012-08-09T09:28:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	See my above comment. XD
2012-08-09T09:29:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	What's the problem with the USB? Does it have an error when making it or does it not boot, etc?
2012-08-09T09:30:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	Win7 says this or is this shown when you try to boot off of it?
2012-08-09T09:31:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	Have you tried again? Make sure there's nothing important on it, and reformat it with the program, if you haven't already. Try making it again.
2012-08-09T09:31:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	Unless it disappears on its own, don't close errors until you tell us exactly what it says. :)
2012-08-09T09:32:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	Yes.
2012-08-09T09:32:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	It doesn't have to be AMD, but if your desktop has UEFI, it definitely works with 64bit.
2012-08-09T09:34:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	zack68491	Not sure what to tell you. At this point, I'd try a reboot and/or redownloading the tool.
