2009-12-06T19:25:00.000Z	petsounds		hi.. in /home i found hidden folder named " Trash-0 " what is actually this folder? there's some gb of files inside.
2009-12-06T19:25:00.000Z	maco	petsounds	its where stuff goes when you move to trash, probably
2009-12-06T19:26:00.000Z	maco	petsounds	though tht seems like the old way of doing it... trash moved a few releases ago. .Trash-0 should only be for removable drives now
2009-12-06T19:28:00.000Z	petsounds	maco	: i delete that folder and get about 13 gb. are you sure it won't affecting my system?
2009-12-06T19:28:00.000Z	maco	petsounds	yes, its everything you moved to trash and then never emptied
2009-12-06T19:28:00.000Z	maco	petsounds	unless you go around renaming folders of things you want to be ".Trash-0"
2009-12-06T19:28:00.000Z	maco	petsounds	in which case...interesting way of organizing your files!
2009-12-06T19:30:00.000Z	petsounds	maco	: ok thank you
2010-01-05T12:05:00.000Z	maco	petsounds	no, whatever version it was shipped with, it keeps
2010-01-05T12:05:00.000Z	maco	petsounds	with exception of bug fix and security updates
2010-01-05T12:05:00.000Z	maco	petsounds	2.28 is in karmic
2010-01-05T12:07:00.000Z	petsounds	maco	thank you for the info :-)
2010-01-17T01:55:00.000Z	petsounds	maco	what's the different? qt is kde.
2010-01-17T01:56:00.000Z	maco	petsounds	quassel was originally made not to use any kde libraries, only the qt toolkit
2010-01-17T01:56:00.000Z	maco	petsounds	now it has compile-time options whether it uses kde libraries and kde widgets for certain things
2010-01-17T01:56:00.000Z	maco	petsounds	kde is an extension of qt
2010-01-17T01:57:00.000Z	maco	petsounds	in lucid, you will be able to choose between installing the kde version or the qt version, but in kamic, it's pure qt
2010-01-17T01:58:00.000Z	petsounds	maco	yeah i can't wait to try kubuntu LTS. i hope they fix the problem with plasma-desktop.
2010-01-17T01:58:00.000Z	maco	petsounds	which would that be?
2010-01-17T01:59:00.000Z	petsounds	maco	plasma-desktop won't run on startup i always have to run it manually.
2010-01-17T02:02:00.000Z	maco	petsounds	uh thats odd. i dont have that problem
