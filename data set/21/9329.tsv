2005-10-05T08:18:00.000Z	ompaul	dobie	that is not how you install software on ubuntu
2005-10-05T08:18:00.000Z	ompaul	dobie	this is a platform with 17k+ packages all ready and waiting
2005-10-05T08:18:00.000Z	dobie	ompaul	- thanks..i've tryed mandrake before..so trying what I ..kind of knew :P
2005-10-05T08:19:00.000Z	ompaul	dobie	use system - administration - synaptic package manager, using source is last resource :)
2005-10-05T08:19:00.000Z	dobie	ompaul	- I see RPM there...but didn't seam to do anything - I typed cmd as: rpm -i <package name> .
2005-10-05T08:19:00.000Z	ompaul	dobie	sudo apt-get install xmms
2005-10-05T08:20:00.000Z	dobie	ompaul	- k.. will give it a run.  ...
2005-10-05T08:20:00.000Z	ompaul	dobie	the synaptic tool is easy to use - have a look at it and repositories - and mark these words  -Backports Are Evil
2005-10-05T08:21:00.000Z	ompaul	dobie	translated as use them if you dare, but please don't complain if they break stuff
2005-10-05T08:21:00.000Z	ompaul	dobie	one last thing I will get the bot to tell you about repos have a look at that before you go any further, will help a lot
2005-10-05T08:22:00.000Z	dobie	ompaul	- sorry dude...I'm just a windozer so far... you saying that xmms is backporting?  I"m not following closely enough on that one...
2005-10-05T08:22:00.000Z	dobie	ompaul	- no prob... I understand the reading that's ahead.... same as when I started with Dos I had a lot of reading... thanks
2005-10-05T08:23:00.000Z	ompaul	dobie	no I did not, what I said was if you use backports please be aware that they are evil - stay away from them :) - now as a windows user - use System - administration - Synaptic Package Manager - BUT first read what the bot will send you on repos
2005-10-05T08:26:00.000Z	dobie	ompaul	- not a prob...it's the backports part i'm not sure of what you mean.  I hear backports I think either a) older software wanting older libraries? or B) another installing means outside normal checks a system normally wants - such as forceing windows to accept a program by manually placing files, settings, and bypassing the windows installer?
2005-10-05T08:28:00.000Z	ompaul	dobie	backports are 'future packages' will be in the next version - and sometimes they cause a looooot of pain
2005-10-05T08:28:00.000Z	ompaul	dobie	pm?
2005-10-05T08:28:00.000Z	dobie	ompaul	Ahhh... i'm on the same page now...I understands.   pm? = pardon me?
2005-10-05T08:29:00.000Z	ompaul	dobie	private message -
2005-10-05T08:29:00.000Z	dobie	ompaul	- I gotta run... someone's just shown up....   ahh.. private message.. understand... thanks man.. I would.. but I  gotta run....
