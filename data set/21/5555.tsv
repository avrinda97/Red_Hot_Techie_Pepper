2007-10-04T15:01:00.000Z	lavender_dream		Okay to be clear: I'd like to install a driver for my USB Wifi Connector (it's for Nintendo DS) but since the device isn't supported for Linux I had to dig around to find a workable driver for it. From ubuntu forum the solution was that I download the driver (which comes as tar ball; tar.bz2) and compile it. I have never done compiling before but I did grab essential-build by: sudo apt-get install build-essential, but now when
2007-10-04T15:01:00.000Z	lavender_dream		trying to compile it by: make, my terminal reads "make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop." I have the file extracted in my home folder.

2007-10-04T15:05:00.000Z	lavender_dream	bascule	this is the post that I got the idea about in ubuntuforums: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?s=1939964e3832054114ff49badd36ede6&t=511751
2007-10-04T15:06:00.000Z	bascule	lavender_dream	the source is broken, the actual code is in the Module directory

2007-10-04T15:07:00.000Z	lavender_dream	bascule	okay to compile from the module directory, what do i need to type in the terminal? it's in my home desktop extracted
2007-10-04T15:08:00.000Z	bascule	lavender_dream	well have you got kernel source installed? If so just type make
2007-10-04T15:08:00.000Z	lavender_dream	bascule	I have the essential-build if that's what you mean
2007-10-04T15:08:00.000Z	bascule	lavender_dream	in fact follow the instructions on the page you liked me to
2007-10-04T15:09:00.000Z	bascule	lavender_dream	no this is a driver it needs the kernel source installed... out your depth?
2007-10-04T15:09:00.000Z	lavender_dream	bascule	Yeah sorry, I'm only a 2 week linux user ;) converted 100% from xp to ubuntu
2007-10-04T15:10:00.000Z	bascule	lavender_dream	this is almost certainly beyond you, but carry it on as a learning experience if you wish, but don't ask me for much help, I don't have the device so can't lead you through to completion, harsh but fair ;)
2007-10-04T15:11:00.000Z	bascule	lavender_dream	first thing you are gonna need is the kernel source for your currently running kernel
2007-10-04T15:12:00.000Z	lavender_dream	bascule	switching to ubuntu was a pure learning and philosophical decision, thank you for the tips though, I'll try to carry on and see, thank you again
2007-10-04T15:12:00.000Z	bascule		welcome
2007-10-04T15:16:00.000Z	bascule	lavender_dream	incidentally it is a broken piece of code and won't build; unless you can fix the C code ... :(
2007-10-04T15:16:00.000Z	bascule		!upgrade
2007-10-04T15:17:00.000Z	bascule		!dist-upgrade > bascule
2007-10-04T15:18:00.000Z	lavender_dream	bascule	hmm... alright thank you regardless
