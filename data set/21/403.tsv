2012-01-08T13:11:00.000Z	kcantu	aaschez	IIRC /tmp is often a virtual folder now
2012-01-08T13:12:00.000Z	aaschez	kcantu	I didn't get you.. what all contributes to /tmp ?
2012-01-08T13:17:00.000Z	aaschez	kcantu	So its advisable to use tmpfs instead of separate /tmp?
2012-01-08T13:20:00.000Z	kcantu	aaschez	yeah, some distros now use tmpfs /tmp by default
2012-01-08T13:21:00.000Z	aaschez	kcantu	'tmpfs /tmp ' ?
2012-01-08T13:22:00.000Z	aaschez	kcantu	Are they two different things or...
2012-01-08T13:22:00.000Z	kcantu	aaschez	tmpfs and in RAM, instead of ext4 or whatever on a hard disk
2012-01-08T13:22:00.000Z	kcantu	aaschez	yes, two different things
2012-01-08T13:22:00.000Z	aaschez	kcantu	So in the installer, one can find the option for tmpfs like how one sees for swap and other fs ?
2012-01-08T13:25:00.000Z	aaschez	kcantu	How much RAM space you got for tmpfs?
2012-01-08T13:28:00.000Z	kcantu	aaschez	i think Ubuntu doesn't by default mount /tmp on a tmpfs http://askubuntu.com/questions/62928/why-doesnt-tmp-use-tmpfs
2012-01-08T13:28:00.000Z	kcantu	aaschez	and that's probably because a lot of people (myself included, sometimes) don't have a lot of RAM
2012-01-08T13:29:00.000Z	aaschez	kcantu	I got 4GB here, so I guess having separate /tmp is the only better option than tmpfs ?
2012-01-08T13:29:00.000Z	kcantu	aaschez	and i doubt the basic installers bother with this: since nothing persistent is stored in /tmp, it would be really easy to change that setup later, if you're one of the people who wants to change it
2012-01-08T13:30:00.000Z	kcantu	aaschez	if you're just doing simple stuff on your computer, having it on the same volume as / is fine
2012-01-08T13:30:00.000Z	kcantu	aaschez	i never bother to customize any of that stuff here at home or on dev machines at work
2012-01-08T13:31:00.000Z	kcantu	aaschez	if i was building a big server for lots of people to use, then i'd do stuff like that
2012-01-08T13:58:00.000Z	aaschez	kcantu	Arbit but what did you mean by 'if you have it on its own partition, filling /tmp means the admins can just laugh'
2012-01-08T14:04:00.000Z	kcantu	aaschez	if you write data to fill your / partition, bad things can happen making it unbootable
2012-01-08T14:04:00.000Z	kcantu	aaschez	if you write data to fill your separate /tmp or /var partition, the system will still be able to boot
2012-01-08T14:06:00.000Z	kcantu	aaschez	if, however, you fill your /tmp folder which is on the same partition as /, then you might be unable to boot
