2010-02-12T12:30:00.000Z	pkm4o93	aceface	Did you say that you are mounting a MAC file system?
2010-02-12T12:31:00.000Z	pkm4o93	aceface	I didnt know it would mount. Last time I treid with puppylinux it refused.
2010-02-12T12:31:00.000Z	pkm4o93	aceface	did you get an error when opening gksu nautilus?
2010-02-12T12:32:00.000Z	aceface	pkm4o93	yeah i'm confused here
2010-02-12T12:32:00.000Z	pkm4o93	aceface	what is the aim of mounting the mac filesystem? backup some stuff?
2010-02-12T12:33:00.000Z	aceface	pkm4o93	yeah, get a few critical files off
2010-02-12T12:33:00.000Z	aceface	pkm4o93	i know it's crazy

2010-02-12T12:34:00.000Z	aceface	pkm4o93	does it support hsf+ easily?
2010-02-12T12:34:00.000Z	pkm4o93	aceface	is your mac non bootable? can you not boot into mac OS burn whatever and go back?
2010-02-12T12:35:00.000Z	aceface	pkm4o93	it's fubar
2010-02-12T12:35:00.000Z	pkm4o93	aceface	when I treid mounting an HFS with puppy 4 or so a yea rago it wouldnt mount.
