2009-12-19T22:08:00.000Z	DarkGlo_		i got the latest handbrake  , i am running ubuntu 9.10 x64 handbrake locks up after selecting dvd in sources and i cannot find the process to kill handbrake
2009-12-19T22:10:00.000Z	DarkGlo_		anyone have any idea how to kill the handbrake process because "handbrake" is not in the process list
2009-12-19T22:10:00.000Z	VCoolio	DarkGlo_	try ghb
2009-12-19T22:10:00.000Z	VCoolio	DarkGlo_	it runs as that for me, don't know why
2009-12-19T22:11:00.000Z	DarkGlo_	VCoolio	the process is ghb?
2009-12-19T22:11:00.000Z	VCoolio	DarkGlo_	for me, yes
2009-12-19T22:11:00.000Z	DarkGlo_	VCoolio	 thanks i see it in the process any idea why it locks up?
2009-12-19T22:12:00.000Z	VCoolio	DarkGlo_	no, sorry, it ran fine for me but I only used it twice
2009-12-19T22:12:00.000Z	DarkGlo_	VCoolio	 well i got the newer version today and before it ran fine for me too but now it seems like it locks up only when choosing the dvd drive
2009-12-19T22:13:00.000Z	VCoolio	DarkGlo_	I have 0.9.4, maybe stick to that one, or are there useful new features?
2009-12-19T22:14:00.000Z	DarkGlo_	VCoolio	 yes better new x264 codec and several new things
2009-12-19T22:14:00.000Z	VCoolio	DarkGlo_	try to run it from a terminal and see if there is useful output
2009-12-19T22:14:00.000Z	DarkGlo_	VCoolio	 good idea
2009-12-19T22:17:00.000Z	DarkGlo_	VCoolio	 yea no output in terminal but yet handbrake still fails lol
2009-12-19T22:17:00.000Z	VCoolio	DarkGlo_	sorry, no clue
2009-12-19T22:17:00.000Z	DarkGlo_	VCoolio	me either but thanks alot for the help
2009-12-19T22:19:00.000Z	DarkGlo_	VCoolio	i found the issue, if anyone else asks.... installing the new HandBrake from deb does not automatically install the libdvdcss2
2009-12-19T22:20:00.000Z	DarkGlo_	VCoolio	if this isnt install it will just freeze lol
2009-12-19T22:20:00.000Z	DarkGlo_	VCoolio	yes but last time it auto installed so i assumed wrongly
2009-12-19T22:20:00.000Z	VCoolio	DarkGlo_	cool, I'll keep that in mind
2009-12-19T22:21:00.000Z	DarkGlo_	VCoolio	it does have many features you should check it out :D
