2012-01-17T03:10:00.000Z	acidfrost	HalfCentMan	hated it then went to puppy which was much better but then found ubuntu and stayed with it for a long time till i got rid of my good laptop and had to run a light weight distro so i went to arch with fluxbox
2012-01-17T03:10:00.000Z	acidfrost	HalfCentMan	hmm how big is it ?
2012-01-17T03:11:00.000Z	acidfrost	HalfCentMan	i'm always interested in older distro's
2012-01-17T03:11:00.000Z	acidfrost	HalfCentMan	yeah lol but my connection does lmfao
2012-01-17T03:14:00.000Z	HalfCentMan	acidfrost	---  443.7
2012-01-17T03:15:00.000Z	acidfrost	HalfCentMan	thats not too bad, though we need to move this convo to /msg
2012-01-17T03:16:00.000Z	HalfCentMan	acidfrost	 true, but at the moment I need to find out how to temp make my natty netbook into a passthru server to give an older machine running slack access to internet via eth <-> wlan link..
2012-01-17T03:17:00.000Z	acidfrost	HalfCentMan	http://www.ubuntu-tennessee.org read my sftp tutorial
2012-01-17T03:17:00.000Z	HalfCentMan	acidfrost	going there now...
2012-01-17T03:19:00.000Z	HalfCentMan	acidfrost	CORRECT...
2012-01-17T03:21:00.000Z	HalfCentMan	acidfrost	I basically want to link the two devices in the netbook (eth0 and wlan0) together as a passthru for the other machine.
2012-01-17T03:22:00.000Z	acidfrost	HalfCentMan	plug ether into slack and your net book then share the connection with network manager ;p
2012-01-17T03:23:00.000Z	HalfCentMan	acidfrost	it seems that the process to config network mgr is what is escaping me..
2012-01-17T03:26:00.000Z	acidfrost	HalfCentMan	give me a second i'll look it up ;p
2012-01-17T03:26:00.000Z	HalfCentMan	acidfrost	Thank You Sir...
2012-01-17T03:27:00.000Z	acidfrost	HalfCentMan	ahh i might have confused network manager with network connections manager
2012-01-17T03:28:00.000Z	HalfCentMan	acidfrost	I'm pretty sure it's done with the 'connection manager', I just need to sort out the settings and get them set right...
