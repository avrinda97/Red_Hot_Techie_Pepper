2010-02-27T04:23:00.000Z	derekboy	Losha	I uninstalled BOINC but the Project I added is still running at startup, and it's not under the System->Administration-> Startup Applications
2010-02-27T04:24:00.000Z	Losha	derekboy	Try running ps ax | egrep -i enigma and pastebin the result...
2010-02-27T04:26:00.000Z	derekboy	Losha	$ ps ax | egrep -i enigma:
2010-02-27T04:27:00.000Z	Losha	derekboy	good. Now run 'egrep -i enigma /etc/init.d/*' and see if you get any hits...
2010-02-27T04:28:00.000Z	derekboy	Losha	http://paste.ubuntu.com/384743/
2010-02-27T04:30:00.000Z	Losha	derekboy	ok, that means it's not started from /etc/init.d. You're going to have to search for it. How large is the disk?
2010-02-27T04:31:00.000Z	derekboy	Losha	Default Wubi install is ~25GB
2010-02-27T04:32:00.000Z	derekboy	Losha	I opened the File Manager and searched it in there. It shows some files but not the file that's under System Monitor
2010-02-27T04:34:00.000Z	Losha	derekboy	try running 'find / -xdev | egrep -i enigma' and see if locates the binary
2010-02-27T04:38:00.000Z	derekboy	Losha	Found it.
2010-02-27T04:38:00.000Z	Losha	derekboy	where?
2010-02-27T04:38:00.000Z	derekboy	Losha	/var/lib/boinc-client/........
2010-02-27T04:38:00.000Z	derekboy	Losha	There's more subfolders
2010-02-27T04:39:00.000Z	derekboy	Losha	Can I just delete the 'boinc-client' folder since it's not installed anymore?
2010-02-27T04:39:00.000Z	Losha	derekboy	someone said the client was probably still around. Try apt-get remove boinc-client first
2010-02-27T04:40:00.000Z	derekboy	Losha	Wow thanks, it is. I uninstalled it through Software Center yesterday though....
2010-02-27T04:41:00.000Z	Losha	derekboy	lazy programmers don't clean up after themselves...
2010-02-27T04:41:00.000Z	derekboy	Losha	Thanks for the advice. Removing it through apt actually killed the process too
2010-02-27T04:42:00.000Z	Losha	derekboy	ah, the small victories....
2010-02-27T04:43:00.000Z	derekboy	Losha	Okay, I would greatly appreciate one more issue I need help with. Under System Monitor, there are like a bazillion Sleeping processes open that are not visible (as in, they're running in the background). Are all of these necessary, or can I stop them from starting at system startup?
2010-02-27T04:45:00.000Z	Losha	derekboy	usually you can get rid of some of them. There are web pages on it I seem to recall. And a program called 'bum' (boot up manager). Do a bit of googling...
