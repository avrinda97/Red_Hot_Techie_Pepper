2006-01-20T09:05:00.000Z	Arafangion	_jason	Bad grammar :)
2006-03-03T10:50:00.000Z	_jason	Arafangion	either escape the {} as \{\} or use egrep
2006-03-03T10:51:00.000Z	Arafangion	_jason	I was under the impression that there is no expansion in '' strings?
2006-03-03T10:51:00.000Z	Arafangion	_jason	Hmm, indeed, you're correct. Thanks.
2006-03-03T10:52:00.000Z	_jason	Arafangion	or grep -E, man grep explains it (kind of :P)
2006-03-03T10:53:00.000Z	Arafangion	_jason	So the fault is with grep, not bash?
2006-03-03T10:54:00.000Z	_jason	Arafangion	it's not a fault, it's just the way it was written.  That's it's intended behavior afaik.  You were correct in saying that '' strings don't get expanded
2006-03-03T10:54:00.000Z	Arafangion	_jason	This is difficult.
2006-03-03T10:55:00.000Z	_jason	Arafangion	basically I use egrep if I wan't a regular expression.  If I just want something simple I do grep
2006-03-03T10:55:00.000Z	Arafangion	_jason	I'll do it in perl.
2006-03-03T10:56:00.000Z	_jason	Arafangion	then you can use grep -P too for perl style regular expressions :)
2006-03-03T11:05:00.000Z	_jason	Arafangion	apparently you need a $ preceding the quoted string for it to match \t, I never knew that... I think perl is looking better more and more :)
2006-03-03T11:06:00.000Z	Arafangion	_jason	What the heck? That's insane!
2006-03-03T11:06:00.000Z	Arafangion	_jason	Using $ should be "Get value of the variable referred to by the string..."
2006-03-03T11:07:00.000Z	_jason	Arafangion	guess it's special with the quotes
2006-03-03T11:07:00.000Z	Arafangion	_jason	I'll just use perl ;)
2006-03-25T06:56:00.000Z	_jason	Arafangion	dpkg -S
2006-03-25T06:56:00.000Z	Arafangion	_jason	Thanks.
2006-06-12T07:57:00.000Z	_jason	Arafangion	if you remove linux-image-386 (or whatever arch you use) you won't get them
2006-06-12T07:58:00.000Z	Arafangion	_jason	Perhaps, but if I have to do configuration just to get ubuntu to behave more like my debian, I might as well just run debian.
2006-06-12T07:59:00.000Z	_jason	Arafangion	yes :)
