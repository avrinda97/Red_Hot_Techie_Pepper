2006-06-28T07:30:00.000Z	cwillu	biscon	Otacon22:  same syntax, but "-o " first
2006-06-30T12:02:00.000Z	cwillu	biscon	what problem?
2006-06-30T12:03:00.000Z	biscon	cwillu	it started yestertoday, when I fire up gaim (I have it configured for auto login), it first logs on to my icq account.. then logs onto msn.. when the msn contacts displays it segfaults and dump a core
2006-06-30T12:03:00.000Z	cwillu	biscon	I've had no problems with my msn account and gaim in the last 6 months; I haven't applied any ubuntu updates this week though
2006-06-30T12:03:00.000Z	biscon	cwillu	ill try and run gdb on it but I think my binary is stripped
2006-06-30T12:03:00.000Z	cwillu	biscon	try uninstalling it and reinstalling
2006-06-30T12:04:00.000Z	biscon	cwillu	I have applied updates but as I remember no one of them were for gaim
2006-06-30T12:04:00.000Z	cwillu	biscon	is it from the ubuntu repo's?
2006-06-30T12:04:00.000Z	biscon	cwillu	hehe the windows fix?.. yeah im gonna try that.. was curious if anyone had the same problem
2006-06-30T12:04:00.000Z	cwillu	biscon	nope, working flawlessly here
2006-06-30T12:05:00.000Z	biscon	cwillu	yups its plain version from the repos
2006-06-30T12:05:00.000Z	cwillu	biscon	ya, remove it (not complete removal though), and reinstall;  should keep your account info
2006-06-30T12:05:00.000Z	biscon	cwillu	weird that it just starts segfaulting.. if they changed the protocol the program should be able to handle that gracefully and exit with an error
2006-06-30T12:06:00.000Z	cwillu	biscon	it's not msn
2006-06-30T12:06:00.000Z	biscon	cwillu	yeah ill try that, thanks
2006-06-30T12:06:00.000Z	cwillu	biscon	it works fine here with no updates
2006-06-30T12:06:00.000Z	biscon	cwillu	yeah but how did I manage to screw it up? ;)
2006-06-30T12:07:00.000Z	cwillu	biscon	is your harddrive old?  done anything with prelinking, running a custom kernel, ...
2006-06-30T12:07:00.000Z	biscon	cwillu	no.. haven't done any of those things on this install
2006-06-30T12:08:00.000Z	biscon	cwillu	this is were it segfaults :0xb6a17fb1 in msn_object_new_from_string () from /usr/lib/gaim/libmsn.so
2006-06-30T12:08:00.000Z	biscon	cwillu	so it is in the msn plugin.. weird
