2008-11-09T14:53:00.000Z	chatcoppa		any reasons i should upgrade to 8.1?
2008-11-09T14:53:00.000Z	chatcoppa		anything "NOTEWORTHY" in 8.10?
2008-11-09T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	read it
2008-11-09T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	change it then
2008-11-09T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	yes
2008-11-09T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	but changing an OS for a new wall paper is insane
2008-11-09T14:56:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	you can't downgrade
2008-11-09T14:56:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	thats just a kernel, not the OS
2008-11-09T15:00:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	read the release notes
2008-11-09T15:00:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	you'll find all the info you keep asking about in there
2008-11-09T15:01:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	it's wise to read them before upgrading
2008-11-09T15:01:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	the name is not important,
2008-11-09T15:01:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	it doesn't matter
2008-11-09T15:03:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	openvz kernel ?
2008-11-09T15:04:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	the reason your graphics change is because the modules for the nvidia card is not setup to run with the openvz kernel
2008-11-09T15:05:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	you need to manually load the modules
2008-11-09T15:06:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	but that is not something the ubuntu support channel is for
2008-11-09T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	your in it, as you well know
2008-11-09T15:10:00.000Z	ikonia	chatcoppa	this channel is for support questions only please
