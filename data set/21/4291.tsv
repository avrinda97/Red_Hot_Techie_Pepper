2008-05-25T02:57:00.000Z	aaBlueDragon		i use 50 hz while i know i can use 60
2008-05-25T02:57:00.000Z	aaBlueDragon		i used envy to get the latest. which seemed to work
2008-05-25T02:57:00.000Z	robg_	aaBlueDragon	what's the difference ?
2008-05-25T02:57:00.000Z	aaBlueDragon		i now use the accelerated drivers

2008-05-25T02:58:00.000Z	robg_	aaBlueDragon	did you get Sun Java ?
2008-05-25T02:59:00.000Z	aaBlueDragon		no
2008-05-25T02:59:00.000Z	aaBlueDragon		would getting sun java help somehow? i mean, its monitor related problem
2008-05-25T02:59:00.000Z	robg_	aaBlueDragon	go to medibuntu repository and follow instructions there. Delete OpenJDK and install Sun Java and all the other nice stuff.
