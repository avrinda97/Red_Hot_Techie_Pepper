2008-04-13T00:50:00.000Z	phil_	tuxus	dont recongize anything
2008-04-13T00:51:00.000Z	tuxus	phil_	from terminal, run "lspci"
2008-04-13T00:52:00.000Z	phil_	tuxus	okay, i see stuff about display and ide..and usb and pci
2008-04-13T00:52:00.000Z	tuxus	phil_	nothing that looks like your wifi card?
2008-04-13T00:53:00.000Z	phil_	tuxus	i had a friend install the card but i dont remember the make of the card
2008-04-13T00:53:00.000Z	phil_	tuxus	i see things about bluetooth
2008-04-13T00:54:00.000Z	tuxus	phil_	find out what card is installed. Are you running ubuntu 7.10?
2008-04-13T00:54:00.000Z	phil_	tuxus	ya
2008-04-13T00:56:00.000Z	tuxus	phil_	system > administration > network   do you see your card?
2008-04-13T00:57:00.000Z	phil_	tuxus	no
2008-04-13T00:58:00.000Z	tuxus	phil_	I'd check if the card is properly installed: open your box, check, and while you're at it, write down any info you see on the card
2008-04-13T00:58:00.000Z	phil_	tuxus	i just installed it, i was running windows xp so i know the card was properly installed and working
2008-04-13T00:59:00.000Z	tuxus	phil_	so, you've got a dual boot, then? Find out through Windows what card it is
2008-04-13T01:00:00.000Z	phil_	tuxus	im only running ubuntu, but i know the card is alright
2008-04-13T01:03:00.000Z	phil_	tuxus	thanks bro
