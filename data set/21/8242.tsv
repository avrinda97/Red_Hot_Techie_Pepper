2007-02-11T07:36:00.000Z	ikonia	HymnToLife	you sure of that ?
2007-02-11T09:16:00.000Z	HymnToLife	ikonia	of course you can
2007-02-11T09:17:00.000Z	ikonia	HymnToLife	you'd have to force it - apt - should error on that

2007-02-11T09:18:00.000Z	ikonia	HymnToLife	I've not got multiple kernels here to check, but I thought I was certain on that
2007-02-11T09:19:00.000Z	HymnToLife	ikonia	it will tell you you're doing something potentially harmful and you'll have to type "yes, do as I say !"
2007-02-11T09:19:00.000Z	ikonia	HymnToLife	I'd have bet money against that - but I don't doubt you
