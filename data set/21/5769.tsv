2008-04-28T14:22:00.000Z	bjames	lassegul	I'm not sure - this is a laptop (3 years old at that), but 367 does seem quite low considering how simple glxgears is
2008-04-28T14:18:00.000Z	lassegul	bjames	how broken?
2008-04-28T14:21:00.000Z	bjames	lassegul	3D graphics worked out-of-box on 7.10
2008-04-28T14:22:00.000Z	lassegul	bjames	im not really sure. is 300+ fps the right fps for a card like yours? thought it sounded kinda low?
2008-04-28T14:23:00.000Z	lassegul	bjames	how about removing the drivers, then installing them (maybe through envy) again?
2008-04-28T14:24:00.000Z	bjames	lassegul	is there a way I can verify the drivers are "working" without reinstalling?
2008-04-28T14:25:00.000Z	bjames	lassegul	and while I remember there is no entry for the driver under the restricted driver manager, so it must be the open source one
2008-04-28T14:26:00.000Z	bjames	lassegul	there is no explicit driver specified in my xorg.conf file
2008-04-28T14:31:00.000Z	lassegul	bjames	ati has something similar to nvdia-xsetting, like aticonfig or something like that?
2008-04-28T14:31:00.000Z	bjames	lassegul	I'm not sure
2008-04-28T14:35:00.000Z	lassegul	bjames	keep me posted on how it goes.
2008-04-28T14:35:00.000Z	bjames	lassegul	I'm just installing "xorg-driver-fglrx"
2008-04-28T14:36:00.000Z	lassegul	bjames	:) lol i think you just found the solution to your problem
2008-04-28T14:36:00.000Z	bjames	lassegul	I tried installing this before and it killed x - I had to fall back to failsafe res
2008-04-28T14:37:00.000Z	lassegul	bjames	try running aticonfig, it should configure it automagically.
2008-04-28T14:40:00.000Z	bjames	lassegul	as I suspected, the lack of "Driver ..." line in my xorg.conf is the problem
2008-04-28T14:40:00.000Z	lassegul	bjames	so it did the trick?
2008-04-28T14:40:00.000Z	bjames	lassegul	no, it complained about the missing Driver line
2008-04-28T14:41:00.000Z	lassegul	bjames	but when running aticonfig it adds Driver to you xorg.conf, doesnt it?
2008-04-28T14:41:00.000Z	lassegul	bjames	do so. i have to go to lunch now, bb in 30 mins
2008-04-28T15:18:00.000Z	lassegul	bjames	did it work out for you?
