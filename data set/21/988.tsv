2011-03-13T09:31:00.000Z	apiechowski_		Does anybody know how i could find the password of my forgotten pass account?
2011-03-13T09:32:00.000Z	apiechowski_		I have tryed both the shadow file AND the passwd file, no luck.
2011-03-13T09:32:00.000Z	apiechowski_		I have also tryed John the Ripper
2011-03-13T09:32:00.000Z	apiechowski_		No luck
2011-03-13T09:33:00.000Z	apiechowski_		Does anybody know how i could find my other user's password on my ubuntu 10.10 netbook?
2011-03-13T09:34:00.000Z	apiechowski_		No.
2011-03-13T09:34:00.000Z	apiechowski_		That isn't my idea
2011-03-13T09:34:00.000Z	apiechowski_		I want to see how easy it is to really find it, and if it's possible.
2011-03-13T09:35:00.000Z	apiechowski_		is it possible to figure out another users password in ubuntu?
2011-03-13T09:37:00.000Z	apiechowski_		syberia, this is a new computer, but i forgot what i set the password as... so i made a new admin account
2011-03-13T09:37:00.000Z	rww	apiechowski_	Password hashes are stored in /etc/shadow. They're hashed with SHA-256 on Ubuntu 10.10, if memory serves. Assuming a strong password, reversing this hash is computationally infeasible.
2011-03-13T09:37:00.000Z	apiechowski_		but i actully want to know (out of curiosity) what it is.
2011-03-13T09:38:00.000Z	rww	apiechowski_	looks like SHA-512 on this system, so even less feasible.
2011-03-13T09:39:00.000Z	apiechowski_	rww	i know it is SHA-512 due to the $6$ in front of the encryption
2011-03-13T09:39:00.000Z	rww	apiechowski_	indeed.
2011-03-13T09:40:00.000Z	apiechowski_	rww	is it possible at all that if i send you the shadow, u could find the pass?
2011-03-13T09:41:00.000Z	rww	apiechowski_	mathematically possible or practically possible?
2011-03-13T09:41:00.000Z	rww	apiechowski_	I mean, theoretically, I could punch random letters in and find it on the first try. But practically, as I said, if it's a reasonably strong password then no.
2011-03-13T09:43:00.000Z	apiechowski_	rww	please acept file transfer.
2011-03-13T09:44:00.000Z	rww	apiechowski_	no
2011-03-13T09:44:00.000Z	apiechowski_	rww	I appoligize for wasting your time.
