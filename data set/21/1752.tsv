2010-06-14T06:33:00.000Z	tucemiux		i cant install software, I dont have an add/remove applet, anyone knows how to fix this??
2010-06-14T06:34:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tucemiux	applications > Software Center
2010-06-14T06:34:00.000Z	tucemiux	acerimmer_	my distro doesnt have software center, i just installed lucid and I cant find the software center applet anywhere!! how do i put the applet into my menu?
2010-06-14T06:35:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tucemiux	are you maybe on a netbook here?
2010-06-14T06:36:00.000Z	tucemiux	acerimmer_	nope, im using ubuntustudio which is the same as ubuntu, just with a real time kernel
2010-06-14T06:36:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tucemiux	me too.  Software Center is NOT an applet
2010-06-14T06:36:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tucemiux	Applications>Ubuntu Software Center
2010-06-14T06:37:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tucemiux	private??
2010-06-14T06:38:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tucemiux	I run ubuntustudio as well.  if you're at the command line, use synaptic apt-get install
2010-06-14T06:40:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tucemiux	maybe I'm confused.  Just how exactly did you install ubuntu and ubuntustudio?
2010-06-14T06:40:00.000Z	tucemiux	acerimmer_	do you have lucid?  ubuntustudio began using software center in lucid but I just installed lucid from an ISO and it didnt have the software center, I upgraded from karmic to lucid and "add/remove" was replaced with "software center".  But "software center" did not get installed when I installed lucid from an ISO
2010-06-14T06:40:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tucemiux	cna you private chat?
2010-06-14T06:40:00.000Z	tucemiux	acerimmer_	yes
2010-06-14T06:41:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tucemiux	ok, first, you did a COMPLETE install of lucid, yes
2010-06-14T06:41:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tucemiux	"indicator applet"
2010-06-14T06:42:00.000Z	tucemiux	acerimmer_	I upgraded karmic to lucid, I hosed it, sort of fixed it, and decided to reinstall lucid using an ISO.  I downloaded the ISO and installed lucid, this time lucid didnt have the software center
2010-06-14T06:45:00.000Z	tucemiux	acerimmer_	rww I got the software center installed, the wireless icon is up where it's supposed to be
2010-06-14T06:45:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tucemiux	so you're all fixed??
2010-06-14T06:46:00.000Z	tucemiux	acerimmer_	yes now im going to reboot to test, im just wondering why that software didnt get installed by default?
2010-06-14T06:46:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tucemiux	do the rebooot and enjoy.
