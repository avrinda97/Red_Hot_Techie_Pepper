2012-07-30T04:51:00.000Z	nonickmick		hello
2012-07-30T04:52:00.000Z	nonickmick		I have a question, i have two hard drives in my pc, one has windows installed on it, the second hard drive is brand new, if i install ubuntu on that second drive, do you see any issues from this ? I plan to just change the boot menu to the hard drive of the OS i wish to use.
2012-07-30T04:53:00.000Z	jagginess	nonickmick	thats fine, but just ask to install grub to the head of the 2nd drive
2012-07-30T04:54:00.000Z	jagginess	nonickmick	eg, is /dev/sdb is the 2nd drive, tell grub to install to /dev/sdb
2012-07-30T04:54:00.000Z	nonickmick	jagginess	would i need to install grub on second drive?
2012-07-30T04:54:00.000Z	jagginess	nonickmick	if you dont want to boot from the first drive..
2012-07-30T04:54:00.000Z	jagginess	nonickmick	i mean there's two stages
2012-07-30T04:54:00.000Z	jagginess	nonickmick	grub's stage1 occurs after the bios..
2012-07-30T04:55:00.000Z	jagginess	nonickmick	if you rather use the "bios" harddrive boot menu (check your motherboard manual), it's possible to choose the 2nd drive directly
2012-07-30T04:56:00.000Z	nonickmick	jagginess	Yeah, my plan was to go into bios and change the boot menu manually to drive one and two, without grub
2012-07-30T04:56:00.000Z	jagginess	nonickmick	there'll always be a chance you may do manual intervention if you choose to install grub on the first harddrive .. so there's more issues in this scenario
2012-07-30T04:56:00.000Z	nonickmick	jagginess	i dont follow your last response
2012-07-30T04:57:00.000Z	jagginess	nonickmick	(installing grub to drive1 , may force you to do manual intervention-- but there would be less worry if you install grub's stage1 to the 2nd drive)
2012-07-30T04:57:00.000Z	jagginess	nonickmick	what i mean is that windows may not boot, and you would have to do "manual" intervention to get it to boot again-- (Windows can boot from the grub menu too)
2012-07-30T04:58:00.000Z	nonickmick	jagginess	even if i only install ubuntu to the second drive?
2012-07-30T04:58:00.000Z	jagginess	nonickmick	(but Windows' stage1 may get broken)
2012-07-30T04:58:00.000Z	jagginess	nonickmick	no not if you do grub's stage1 to the 2nd drive.. there's not this worry
2012-07-30T04:59:00.000Z	nonickmick	jagginess	awesome that's what I'll do, how can i ensure my second drive is actually sdb ?
2012-07-30T05:00:00.000Z	jagginess	nonickmick	well it may change the /dev/sda or /dev/sdb lettering if you have an external ahci drive.. but you'll know when you do manual partitioning on the installer -- it'll say what is what for /dev/sda or /dev/sdb
2012-07-30T05:00:00.000Z	nonickmick	jagginess	thanks, and, should i download 32bit or 64 ?
2012-07-30T05:01:00.000Z	jagginess	nonickmick	back up your data first
