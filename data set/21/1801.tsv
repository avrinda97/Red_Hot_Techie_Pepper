2011-02-05T04:04:00.000Z	rumpe1	UbuntuNoob	even if you mark it as executable, it will only be executable, if it's executable under linux...
2011-02-05T04:05:00.000Z	rumpe1	UbuntuNoob	.msi-files are for windows... you need wine or a virtual windows installation
2011-02-05T04:06:00.000Z	rumpe1	UbuntuNoob	then try "wine /path/to/file/file.msi"
2011-02-05T04:13:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob	rumpe1	and whats that do?
2011-02-05T04:13:00.000Z	rumpe1	UbuntuNoob	mouning the partition or returning an error-message
