2007-05-31T05:06:00.000Z	jrib	cerealkiller219	at what point does it stall?
2007-05-31T05:06:00.000Z	cerealkiller219	jrib	it failed some file during the upgrade, not sure which oen
2007-05-31T05:06:00.000Z	cerealkiller219	jrib	it brings up the boot screen with nautilus on it, and stops there
2007-05-31T05:06:00.000Z	cerealkiller219	jrib	i can log in fine but cant get any further
2007-05-31T05:06:00.000Z	jrib	cerealkiller219	have you tried creating a new user?
2007-05-31T05:06:00.000Z	cerealkiller219	jrib	no
2007-05-31T05:07:00.000Z	jrib	cerealkiller219	I would try that before you resort to a reinstall.  Also try just logging into a tty and see if that works
2007-05-31T05:07:00.000Z	cerealkiller219	jrib	if I must reinstall, will I lose anything?
2007-05-31T05:07:00.000Z	jrib	cerealkiller219	well not if you have backups or /home on a seperate partition
2007-05-31T05:08:00.000Z	cerealkiller219		:(
2007-05-31T05:08:00.000Z	cerealkiller219	jrib	ok, thank you
2007-05-31T05:08:00.000Z	jrib	cerealkiller219	if you decide you need to reinstall, use a live cd to backup your files first
2007-05-31T05:08:00.000Z	cerealkiller219	jrib	alright thanks
