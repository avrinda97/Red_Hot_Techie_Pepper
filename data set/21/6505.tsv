2007-05-28T12:44:00.000Z	duncan_		can anyone help me out with a wireless networking issue with ubuntu please?
2007-05-28T12:45:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	I have *limited* experience, what is the issue?
2007-05-28T12:46:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	Have you tried just entering that command in terminal? GTKWifi, once you installed? How did you install it?
2007-05-28T12:49:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	No.
2007-05-28T12:49:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	Not if it's installed correctly.
2007-05-28T12:50:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	Ok, one sec, let me look into this.
2007-05-28T12:51:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	Wait, is the program running?
2007-05-28T12:51:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	Where did you read that this was a good utility? What network card are you running?
2007-05-28T12:51:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	It's not a problem....I hope I can help you solve it.
2007-05-28T12:52:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	Ok. Let's take a step backwards....What card do you have?
2007-05-28T12:53:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	I can give you a command just as ec.
2007-05-28T12:55:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	Run 'lspci' then look for wireless and tell me what card.
2007-05-28T13:01:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	I really don't know much about gtkwifi I can try to help you trouble shoot your card a bit. Otherwise, I am going to run
2007-05-28T13:03:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	Run the following command to determine what wireless card it is: 'lspci' look for the wireess information
2007-05-28T13:04:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	Ok, let me see if there are any related issues.
2007-05-28T13:06:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	It seems like there are some issues here, but I believe they are workable...Just give me a sec.
2007-05-28T13:10:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	As far as I can tell, a lot of people are having problems with these cards. I've found a guide, to walk you through get it working...It seems rather comprehensive: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=140085
2007-05-28T13:11:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	At the moment, I have to run, I am sure someone here can help you if you get stuck while running through the guide...If you still have problems, I am often around the channel, although I'll probably be gone for the night now.
2007-05-28T13:11:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	But the guide is step by step, so, it should be no worries.
2007-05-28T13:12:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	No recompiling kernels involved...Just running some command lines, possibly compiling a package or two...I am a fairly newb myself, just follow the steps, also, ifyou have a specific problem doing so, it may be in the responses and addressed.
2007-05-28T13:14:00.000Z	PurpZeY	duncan_	Now that you know the card is the issue, you can use whatever fix you think works best, just check the forums...Not a problem duncan_, happy to help. Have a nice day.
