2011-01-20T00:07:00.000Z	soreau	sl33k_	What happens when you try 'alsamixer' from your terminal?

2011-01-20T00:09:00.000Z	soreau	sl33k_	So you have a driver loaded.. but there is no audio output at all?
2011-01-20T00:10:00.000Z	soreau	sl33k_	In alsamixer, use arrow keys to navigate and 'm' to (un)mute
2011-01-20T00:10:00.000Z	sl33k_	soreau	the output is through the speaker to even if i plug in the headphones.
2011-01-20T00:11:00.000Z	sl33k_	soreau	speaker too*
2011-01-20T00:11:00.000Z	soreau	sl33k_	Is it working?
2011-01-20T00:12:00.000Z	sl33k_	soreau	sorry din get your question

2011-01-20T00:13:00.000Z	sl33k_	soreau	hda intel
2011-01-20T00:15:00.000Z	sl33k_	soreau	there is nthing mentioned about sound output playing both ways simultaneously
2011-01-20T00:15:00.000Z	soreau	sl33k_	Are you sure your card is capable of doing that?
2011-01-20T00:16:00.000Z	sl33k_	soreau	no idea,  newbie
2011-01-20T00:17:00.000Z	soreau	sl33k_	I don't know what your setup looks like or how the intel hda cards work so you have to find out if your card can actually do what you want. If so, it should be as simple as configuring it correctly
2011-04-11T16:37:00.000Z	soreau	sl33k_	One is /a/b the other is $HOME/a/b
