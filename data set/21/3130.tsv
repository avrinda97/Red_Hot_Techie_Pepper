2009-03-27T08:32:00.000Z	JustinNFX		thanks rww!
2009-03-27T08:33:00.000Z	JustinNFX		anyone know a workaround for using a ATI card that makes the screen go blank during install?
2009-03-27T08:34:00.000Z	JustinNFX		Is ubuntu always buggy with ATI would buying a NVIDA card be worth the $$$?
2009-03-27T08:36:00.000Z	JustinNFX		then when i use safe graffic mode it wont let me resize my hard drive.. its crazy hard .. and it never worked
2009-03-27T08:36:00.000Z	JustinNFX		yeah i think my is like 2400, of 2200 radeon.
2009-03-27T08:36:00.000Z	JustinNFX		Radeon
2009-03-27T08:37:00.000Z	JustinNFX		I don't underestand because the ATI card is actually better with graffics then my brand new intel card on my lappy which works fine with ubuntu
2009-03-27T08:39:00.000Z	JustinNFX		So, if I were to buy another video card (under $100) if i were to play it safe go with a semi-new Nvida.
2009-03-27T08:39:00.000Z	JustinNFX		Nvida seems to have a love relationship with ubuntu.
2009-03-27T08:40:00.000Z	JustinNFX		Anybody recommend a economic but efficient card for use with ubuntu and the upcomming distros?
2009-03-27T08:40:00.000Z	tritium	JustinNFX	upcoming releases, you mean?
2009-03-27T08:40:00.000Z	tritium	JustinNFX	ubuntu is the distro
2009-03-27T08:42:00.000Z	tritium	JustinNFX	I use nVidia, particularly for my myth boxes, but it depends on your needs, and what you'll use your machine for.
2009-03-27T08:44:00.000Z	tritium	JustinNFX	no, you'd need a tuner card.  Integrated graphics are sufficient for HTPCs.
2009-03-27T08:46:00.000Z	tritium	JustinNFX	the TV tuner has a coax input.  For a modern HTPC, you'd want HDMI or DVI out to our high-def television.
2009-03-27T08:47:00.000Z	tritium	JustinNFX	no
2009-03-27T08:48:00.000Z	tritium	JustinNFX	it's offtopic for this channel
2009-03-27T08:48:00.000Z	JustinNFX	tritium	im sorry i thought it had to do with ubuntu since ubuntu makes a mythtv
2009-03-27T08:49:00.000Z	tritium	JustinNFX	#ubuntu-mythtv, if you care to ask in there
2009-03-27T08:51:00.000Z	tritium	JustinNFX	mythbuntu is what you're referring to.  /join #ubuntu-mythtv
2009-03-27T09:23:00.000Z	tritium	JustinNFX	no need for sudo with man
