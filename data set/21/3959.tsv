2010-07-31T02:26:00.000Z	guntbert	alan_	ah --  I read "I want to do it quickly..."  sorry
2010-07-31T02:28:00.000Z	alan_	guntbert	just checked the rooms there is no #quickly
2010-07-31T02:30:00.000Z	guntbert	alan_	sorry, I have no knowledge about that software :-(
2010-07-31T02:31:00.000Z	alan_		funtbert:hmmm ok not sure where to get the info. the documentation doesn't seem to have the info
2010-07-31T02:32:00.000Z	alan_		Guntbert: sorry for mispelling
2010-07-31T02:32:00.000Z	alan_		Guntbert:hmmm ok not sure where to get the info. the documentation doesn't seem to have the info
2010-07-31T02:33:00.000Z	guntbert	alan_	no problem :) did you see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Quickly ?
2010-07-31T02:34:00.000Z	alan_		Guntbert:yes I did there is is a lot of info there. Didn't see anything about that
2010-07-31T02:34:00.000Z	guntbert	alan_	if you cannot find the info elsewhere -- look into the source :-)
2010-07-31T02:35:00.000Z	alan_		Guntbert: What do you mean?
2010-07-31T02:36:00.000Z	alan_		mloskot:kdevelop is for kde are you useing kde or gnome?
2010-07-31T02:37:00.000Z	guntbert	alan_	well - quickly is open source - so you should be able to look into the source code and see if there is any handling of command line parameters and what form they should have
2010-07-31T02:37:00.000Z	alan_		guntbert:I get it good suggestion
2010-07-31T02:39:00.000Z	alan_		mlsskot: just asking because some people don't have kde and want to use them under gnome. Your right theo if you have them both installed it should work under gnome too
2010-07-31T02:40:00.000Z	guntbert	alan_	btw, did you try "man quickly" and  "quickly -h" ?
