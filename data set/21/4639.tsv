2008-03-14T21:13:00.000Z	Econael		I just saw in sysinfo that the cpu is running on 1600mhz instead of 2100, how can I fix this?
2008-03-14T21:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	Econael	those cards are supported in ubuntu afaik (althoughti heard problems of link stability with rt61)
2008-03-14T21:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	Econael	that's cpufreq scaling
2008-03-14T21:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	Econael	which cpu?
2008-03-14T21:14:00.000Z	Econael	erUSUL	it's an old CPU, "Athlon XP", it doesn't support speedstepping
2008-03-14T21:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	Econael	2100+ ??
2008-03-14T21:15:00.000Z	Econael	erUSUL	sysinfo says AMD Athlon(tm) XP 1900+ but it's a 2600+
2008-03-14T21:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Econael	you know that the number is no nominal speed; don't you?
2008-03-14T21:16:00.000Z	Econael	erUSUL	yes
2008-03-14T21:16:00.000Z	Econael	erUSUL	it should be 2100mhz
2008-03-14T21:16:00.000Z	Econael	erUSUL	it's an old CPU I've head for years in other computers
2008-03-14T21:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Econael	install and run as root x86info
2008-03-14T21:19:00.000Z	Econael	erUSUL	x86info says  Family: 6 Model: 8 Stepping: 1 CPU Model : Athlon XP (Thoroughbred)[B0]
2008-03-14T21:20:00.000Z	Econael	erUSUL	maybe I should check the bios setting, could have turned the frequency down after a power shortage or hard shutdown
2008-03-14T21:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	Econael	yep
2008-03-16T23:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	Econael	Sound juicer comes installed
2008-03-16T23:18:00.000Z	Econael	erUSUL	it can't record into mp3
2008-03-16T23:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	Econael	if you install the gstreamer multiverse ugly plus liblame or lame you can
2008-03-16T23:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	Econael	i personally use grip + lame
2008-03-16T23:20:00.000Z	Econael	erUSUL	looks good, thanks
2008-03-16T23:20:00.000Z	Econael	erUSUL	one last question: does anyone pay you to be here and help people?
