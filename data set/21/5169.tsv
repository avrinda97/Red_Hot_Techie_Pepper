2010-09-20T03:38:00.000Z	turtle_		(hopefully) quick question, is there any easy way of updating intltool? need a newer version to config the compiz extras apparently
2010-09-20T03:38:00.000Z	soreau	turtle_	Which version of ubuntu are you using?
2010-09-20T03:38:00.000Z	turtle_		10.10
2010-09-20T03:39:00.000Z	soreau	turtle_	It is not likely you need a newer version then.

2010-09-20T03:39:00.000Z	turtle_		 found
2010-09-20T03:39:00.000Z	turtle_		configure: error: Your intltool is too old.  You need intltool 0.35.0 or later.

2010-09-20T03:49:00.000Z	turtle_		so why would it say I need to update my intltool when trying to config the compiz extras?
2010-09-20T03:49:00.000Z	soreau	turtle_	Can you pastebin the output?
2010-09-20T03:50:00.000Z	turtle_		sure give us a mo

2010-09-20T03:57:00.000Z	soreau	turtle_	I appears you don't have intltool installed at all. What is the output of apt-get install intltool?
2010-09-20T03:59:00.000Z	turtle_	soreau	from what i was readin on the net i thought it came pre-installed, its installed now ill try again
2010-09-20T04:00:00.000Z	turtle_		i did look for it on the software centre but turned up nothin
2010-09-20T04:01:00.000Z	soreau	turtle_	Most development tools are not installed by default on ubuntu. Did you know there is a script to build compiz 0.9 and takes care of all deps and plugins for you?
2010-09-20T04:02:00.000Z	turtle_	soreau	I was not! will check for it now

2010-09-20T04:06:00.000Z	turtle_	soreau	is this to the same effect as this? http://santiance.com/2010/07/compile-compiz-0-9-0-in-ubuntu/
2010-09-20T04:07:00.000Z	soreau	turtle_	No it is not. He has a very old snapshot of the script there
2010-09-20T04:11:00.000Z	turtle_	soreau	thanks very much!
