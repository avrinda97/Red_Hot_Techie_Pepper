2008-09-24T13:13:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Shaggs	are there partitions on sdb ?
2008-09-24T13:13:00.000Z	Shaggs	Agent_bob	apparently
2008-09-24T13:14:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Shaggs	the filesystem isn't on sdb it's on a partition on dsb
2008-09-24T13:15:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Shaggs	the filesystem isn't on sdb it's on a partition on sdb
2008-09-24T13:16:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Shaggs	run fdisk on the image   it might show where the partitions start/end     fdisk -l file.iso
2008-09-24T13:20:00.000Z	Shaggs	Agent_bob	interesting, the number of sectors and heads matches the drive, but the number of cylinders is 0 when it should be 825
2008-09-24T13:26:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Shaggs	should be able to
2008-09-24T13:39:00.000Z	Shaggs	Agent_bob	*sigh* so i tried both using an offset in the mount, and dd'ing out the partition, but it still has file system troubles
2008-09-24T13:40:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Shaggs	error message is ?
2008-09-24T13:40:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Shaggs	and mount command was ?
2008-09-24T13:43:00.000Z	Shaggs	Agent_bob	ooo, i think i just got it
2008-09-24T13:47:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Shaggs	testdisk  ?
2008-09-24T13:58:00.000Z	Shaggs	Agent_bob	so in theory, i could format another drive, and copy this partion image into the other drive's partion image?
2008-09-24T13:58:00.000Z	Shaggs	Agent_bob	by observing the partion offsets
2008-09-24T13:58:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Shaggs	yes
2008-09-24T13:59:00.000Z	Shaggs	Agent_bob	ok, that's pretty handy, thanks
2008-09-24T14:00:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Shaggs	note what ikonia is warning you about,   dd is both an eye sergury lazor and an atomic bomb     so unless you are prepared to lose all data don't play with it.
2008-09-24T14:02:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Shaggs	an imaging tool will only read write within boundries.   dd will read/write anything you point it at
2008-09-24T14:03:00.000Z	Shaggs	Agent_bob	i've noticed ;)   I'm starting with a drive that is both a) messed up by EZ-Drive and b) has corrupt data
2008-09-24T14:05:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Shaggs	heh yes.    as long as you do note that one oops and all is lost,   go for it man.     i would.    but in the end there is still no substitute for well kept backups.
2008-09-24T14:12:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Shaggs	heh and the bad habbit there is not reading what the input is asking for...  :)
