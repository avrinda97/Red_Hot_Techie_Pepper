2008-06-28T14:29:00.000Z	solrize		it would be nice to be able to nest packages
2008-06-28T14:29:00.000Z	solrize		is that possible?
2008-06-28T14:30:00.000Z	solrize		bookmarking
2008-06-28T14:31:00.000Z	solrize		freenode has ssl?
2008-06-28T14:31:00.000Z	solrize		i think it's kind of pointless since most people aren't using it
2008-06-28T14:32:00.000Z	solrize		32 bit?
2008-06-28T14:33:00.000Z	solrize		sometimes i think of running openbsd
2008-06-28T14:33:00.000Z	gordonjcp	solrize	not worth it, tbh
2008-06-28T14:34:00.000Z	solrize	gordonjcp	i'm not sure what tbh means but i think i get your drift :)
2008-06-28T14:34:00.000Z	gordonjcp	solrize	OpenBSD is basically NetBSD that doesn't work properly, with a project team headed up by an arrogant nobber
2008-06-28T14:34:00.000Z	solrize	gordonjcp	yeah that's about the impression i had... but they do seem to be more vigilant about locking stuff down
2008-06-28T14:34:00.000Z	gordonjcp	solrize	yeah, except they're not
2008-06-28T14:34:00.000Z	gordonjcp	solrize	they haven't got a *clue* how to do it properly
2008-06-28T14:34:00.000Z	gordonjcp	solrize	and then TdR *lies* about how secure it is
2008-06-28T14:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	solrize	like, the whole "no exploits in ten years thing" - except every time they find an exploit they change what they define an exploit as
2008-06-28T14:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	solrize	like for instance a very serious buffer overrun that is a remote root vuln is "errata", not an exploit
2008-06-28T14:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	solrize	well the openssl bug that affected Debian, Ubuntu et al was just Debian upstream vandalism
2008-06-28T14:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	solrize	people were fiddling with stuff they don't understand
2008-06-28T14:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	solrize	we should take this to #u-ot
2008-06-28T14:37:00.000Z	solrize	gordonjcp	yeah that debian thing was outrageous
2008-06-28T14:37:00.000Z	solrize	gordonjcp	ok
