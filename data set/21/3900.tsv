2008-09-10T16:44:00.000Z	_8472		Hi, is there any chance to enable in Gnome this kind of METACITY setting "automatically give focus to newly created windows" ? I'm already searching for it for some time, but still no success. Always have found similar answer, it's not in Gnome ....... , but i don't like this answer. thx in advance
2008-09-10T16:45:00.000Z	Haegin	_8472	have you considered that maybe it really isn't in gnome? you might be better looking at using another window manager that does support what you want?
2008-09-10T16:47:00.000Z	_8472	Haegin	well, but i'm trying to find if there isn't some "unofficial", maybe hidden bypass
2008-09-10T16:48:00.000Z	Haegin	_8472	not that I am aware of, try looking into openbox and see if that can do it as you can use that as a replacement for metacity in gnome
2008-09-10T16:51:00.000Z	_8472	Haegin	yes, have found this kind of advice somewhere in some discussion forum, to change window manager for something else, openbox, and one more was mentioned, but didn't remember the name. anyway, never've done that before, so i don't know how (no links necessary), or what can be messed in the system.
2008-09-10T16:52:00.000Z	Haegin	_8472	sudo aptitude install openbox, logout, at the login screen change session to Gnome + Openbox, login, live long and prosper
2008-09-10T16:54:00.000Z	_8472	Haegin	hm, so easy? ok, may try when won't have nothing to do. anyway, do you have any experiences with openbox? i don't, so i would like to know what else will change?
2008-09-10T16:54:00.000Z	Haegin	_8472	i do, it just changes your window manager which only effect the borders around the windows. everything else should be fine
2008-09-10T16:55:00.000Z	_8472	Haegin	heheeee :)))) "live long and prosper" trekkie fellow :)))) nice :)
2008-09-10T16:56:00.000Z	_8472	Haegin	ok, i think i can live with such small changes
2008-09-10T16:58:00.000Z	_8472	Haegin	i will try that someday when i'll have time. thx for this first possible advice. but anyway, boys in the gnome dev. should think about some switch to change this thing, default may be off if they like it this way.
2008-09-10T16:59:00.000Z	Haegin	_8472	i can't remember what features openbox has so check it first
2008-09-10T16:59:00.000Z	Haegin	_8472	also just google for metacity auto focus new windows and you will see all of them are complaints so it isn't a popular feature
2008-09-10T17:01:00.000Z	_8472	Haegin	don't worry i will try it first on some virtual pc & ubuntu or xubuntu laptop, to see those changes
2008-09-10T17:02:00.000Z	_8472	Haegin	ok, might be it's not beloved option, but still, i've found lot of requests from people who would like it as i do. and also found articles about KDE and XFCE which have this option to enable or disable this
2008-09-10T17:03:00.000Z	Haegin	_8472	gnome uses the sensible defaults, simple configuration design plan
2008-09-10T17:06:00.000Z	_8472	Haegin	hmm, could you explain this please "gnome uses the sensible defaults, simple configuration design plan"? i'm not sure if i fully understand to this: "simple configuration design plan"
2008-09-10T17:07:00.000Z	Haegin	_8472	simple configuration means that to keep it simple they don't offer every possible option, just the popular ones
2008-09-10T17:13:00.000Z	_8472	Haegin	hm, this might be popular no?
2008-09-10T17:14:00.000Z	Haegin	_8472	most people hate windows popping over the top. it is annoying as a small rabbit constantly gnawing on your kneecaps
2008-09-10T17:15:00.000Z	_8472	Haegin	ok, have to go. thx again for that openbox hint
