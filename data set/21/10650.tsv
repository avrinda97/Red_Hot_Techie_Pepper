2005-01-07T13:24:00.000Z	pdaoust		hey Kickstart...
2005-01-07T13:24:00.000Z	pdaoust		you from Vancouver or Victoria?
2005-01-07T13:25:00.000Z	Kickstart	pdaoust	Vancouver-ish :)
2005-01-07T13:26:00.000Z	Kickstart	pdaoust	today was mostly crappy with a little clearing before it got dark. Supposed to be nicer tomorrow but weather.ca is predicting rain for Tuesday (they are usually more wrong than right)
2005-01-07T13:26:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	I've noticed that ^_^ they predicted snow all last week when my friend was coming from Florida, but not a flake
2005-01-07T13:27:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	I can't remember which method I used to install Java... one sec
2005-01-07T13:27:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	must be :)
2005-01-07T13:28:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	I used method 1, I believe. what's your problem?
2005-01-07T13:28:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	hmmm, java-common... do you have warty universe repository enabled?
2005-01-07T13:29:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	pooey. java-common seems to be part of warty; don't know why it's not showing up
2005-01-07T13:31:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	thanks for the heads-up ;) I always assume people are n00bs and work up from there ^_^ usually works, because I'm a n00b myself!
2005-01-07T13:32:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	that's interesting; where's that coming from, I wonder
2005-01-07T13:36:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	sorry, I forgot your answer: did you say you have both warty universe and multiverse enabled?
2005-01-07T13:37:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	ah, that might be it; maybe it's in universe
2005-01-07T13:40:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	well ain't that just feces
2005-01-07T13:42:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	do you have 'restricted' repository enabled?
2005-01-07T13:43:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	betcha anything it's in the restricted repository
2005-01-07T13:45:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	ah, so you ignored commented-out lines
2005-01-07T13:45:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	cool
2005-01-07T13:48:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	glad I could help! not quite sure why main and restricted were set to CD-only
2005-01-07T13:48:00.000Z	pdaoust	Kickstart	yeah, that's weird; maybe I changed it as soon as I installed, so I forgot about it
