2009-07-09T20:17:00.000Z	pokesomi	mezquitale	i do have the 9.04 ubuntu
2009-07-09T20:19:00.000Z	mezquitale	pokesomi	what video drivers are you using?  are you using the "new" drivers or older drivers?
2009-07-09T20:21:00.000Z	pokesomi	mezquitale	the defaults that come with 9.04
2009-07-09T20:21:00.000Z	mezquitale	pokesomi	first uninstall all your drivers, purge the software and clean your system:
2009-07-09T20:21:00.000Z	pokesomi	mezquitale	this is a clean install.  only added xchat
2009-07-09T20:23:00.000Z	mezquitale	pokesomi	before you do that find out which drivers you have installed
2009-07-09T20:24:00.000Z	pokesomi	mezquitale	what ever comes with ubuntu is what i am using.  i havent installed any drivers
2009-07-09T20:24:00.000Z	mezquitale	pokesomi	then you dont have a problem with your nvidia drivers LoL  what youre trying to do is to install the drivers, go to "system-->Administration-->Hardware drivers"
2009-07-09T20:25:00.000Z	pokesomi	mezquitale	 i have a geforce 6100 which one do i use?
2009-07-09T20:26:00.000Z	mezquitale	pokesomi	of you can be adventerous and try the new ones specially if you have a 32 bit machine
2009-07-09T20:33:00.000Z	mezquitale	pokesomi	you want to completely purge nvidia before you try 173
2009-07-09T20:34:00.000Z	mezquitale	pokesomi	fire up synaptic and try installing the software using synaptic
2009-07-09T20:35:00.000Z	mezquitale	pokesomi	dont fire up synaptic LoL that post wasnt for you
2009-07-09T20:37:00.000Z	mezquitale	pokesomi	you have to purge the nvidia software like i showed you before then try the hardware ddrivers again, if you dont have an option to install them then go to "add/remove" an install the drivers, make sure you dont have 180 installed then install the older drivers, this will only install the drivers, then go to "Hardware Drivers" and you should be able to use the drivers you just installed using "add/remove"
2009-07-09T20:38:00.000Z	pokesomi	mezquitale	 the drivers i just tried have been removed
2009-07-09T20:39:00.000Z	mezquitale	pokesomi	and you purged the drivers as well, right?  now install the older drivers using "add/remove"
2009-07-09T20:40:00.000Z	pokesomi	mezquitale	can you walk me through this really quick in private chat?
