2011-10-12T11:55:00.000Z	xpurple		I setup spamassasin and setup emails spam@xxx.com and ham@xxx.com for people bounch mail to for training. Then a cron job for sa-learn.  This should work, right?
2011-10-12T11:57:00.000Z	Companion	xpurple	I admire you for owning xxx.com
2011-10-12T11:57:00.000Z	xpurple	Companion	Hahahaha, example :)
2011-10-12T11:57:00.000Z	xpurple	Companion	Anyway, that should work, right?
2011-10-12T11:58:00.000Z	Companion	xpurple	lemme read
2011-10-12T11:58:00.000Z	Companion	xpurple	there is an easyer method
2011-10-12T11:58:00.000Z	xpurple	Companion	Oh?
2011-10-12T11:58:00.000Z	Companion	xpurple	when installing Virtualmin (Webmin Fork) you can let it auto configure Spam Assassin
2011-10-12T11:59:00.000Z	Companion	xpurple	and its easyer to manage website/e-mails etc
2011-10-12T12:00:00.000Z	xpurple	Companion	Hmm, I'd prefer nothing they have to login to as my users are not very tech savy.
2011-10-12T12:00:00.000Z	Companion	xpurple	they wont have to login, you can set it up & you can do the work for them
2011-10-12T12:01:00.000Z	Companion	xpurple	you can also set it up that way that it goes trough > POP3 > Spam Assassin > Forward
2011-10-12T12:02:00.000Z	xpurple	Companion	I currently have them pop mail so the mboxes are empty when I check them except at night when the shop is closed.
2011-10-12T12:02:00.000Z	Companion	xpurple	ah that bycicle
2011-10-12T12:03:00.000Z	xpurple	Companion	Yes, so long as what I have works I'm happy.  Easy enough to train 20 or so people to bounce messages.
2011-10-12T12:04:00.000Z	Companion	xpurple	I made it too easy for the people at my work, now they fired me cause I am no longer needed :')
2011-10-12T12:04:00.000Z	xpurple	Companion	hahahaha
2011-10-12T12:05:00.000Z	Companion	xpurple	its real simple I setup Virtualmin + Usermin made a skin/theme that is idiot proof and it works :)
2011-10-12T12:05:00.000Z	xpurple	Companion	I will do some reading on that.
2011-10-12T12:05:00.000Z	xpurple	Companion	Thank you!
2011-10-12T12:05:00.000Z	Companion	xpurple	its np, virtualmin also supports Pop3 and such and has a great overview on spamassasin and such
