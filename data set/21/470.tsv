2011-11-26T00:41:00.000Z	greves		hello, i have a question about dual booting
2011-11-26T00:43:00.000Z	greves		can anyone advise me on dual booting? just bought a machine with no OS, i will primarily use win7 which i haven't installed yet, i have a 1TB hard drive - what is the best way to partition for ubuntu?
2011-11-26T00:45:00.000Z	greves		like, can i "share" the drive between windows and ubutu?
2011-11-26T00:45:00.000Z	lunitik	greves	sure
2011-11-26T00:45:00.000Z	lunitik	greves	I would recommend creating a separate drive for it rather than the windows c: though
2011-11-26T00:46:00.000Z	greves	lunitik	how big should i make the ubuntu drive to be useable?
2011-11-26T00:47:00.000Z	greves	lunitik	assuming i'll just save anything bigger than a few hundred MB direct to the windows partition
2011-11-26T00:47:00.000Z	lunitik	greves	I would recommend at least 5 gigs, and something like 15 gigs for c: ... then utilizing tweak UI to move Windows apps to d: and share d: on both systems
2011-11-26T00:48:00.000Z	greves	lunitik	that sounds like a good idea...
2011-11-26T00:48:00.000Z	greves	lunitik	so then my drives would be: /dev/sda1 (15gb c:), sda2 (960gb d:), sda3 (15gb ubuntu), sda4 (2gb swap)
2011-11-26T00:49:00.000Z	greves	lunitik	something like that?
2011-11-26T00:49:00.000Z	lunitik	greves	it is actually good practice anyway, that way you can reinstall the main windows system every so often to ensure best performance
2011-11-26T00:49:00.000Z	lunitik	greves	well, I would recommend a small /boot partition of maybe 300mb to keep grub safe as well
2011-11-26T00:49:00.000Z	greves	lunitik	oh speaking of that, i was planning to use norton ghost to make a backup of the windows install + ninite downloads
2011-11-26T00:49:00.000Z	lunitik	greves	unless you are familiar with the Windows boot manager
2011-11-26T00:49:00.000Z	greves	lunitik	so i'd need another partition for that, no?
2011-11-26T00:50:00.000Z	lunitik	greves	yes, for /boot
2011-11-26T00:51:00.000Z	lunitik	greves	15 gigs is more than enough to not even need to share drives on the Ubuntu system... Windows 7 is HUGE though
2011-11-26T00:53:00.000Z	lunitik	greves	part 1: 500mb /boot; part 2: 15 gig windows c:\; part 3: 5 gb Ubuntu (can use a swap file); part 4: shared drive (d:\ and say /home/$USER/stuff/
2011-11-26T00:53:00.000Z	lunitik	greves	you can move it there via tweak ui, yes... if adobe obeys the new programs folder
2011-11-26T00:54:00.000Z	lunitik	greves	d: or a usb stick to keep it safer
