2010-08-25T08:37:00.000Z	yaaang	randomOfAmber	i do want to, i just seem to be unable to
2010-08-25T08:36:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	yaaang	you don't want it to use your disk as a software source? System > Administration > Software Sources
2010-08-25T08:37:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	yaaang	you've been in system > administration > software sources?
2010-08-25T08:38:00.000Z	yaaang	randomOfAmber	yes
2010-08-25T08:38:00.000Z	yaaang	randomOfAmber	i checked the box at the bottom corresponding to the CD
2010-08-25T08:38:00.000Z	yaaang	randomOfAmber	in addition i tried using apt-cdrom
2010-08-25T08:38:00.000Z	yaaang	randomOfAmber	now i see two CD sources in that dialog (both checked)
2010-08-25T08:38:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	yaaang	you don't want it to use your cdrom, right?
2010-08-25T08:39:00.000Z	yaaang	randomOfAmber	ah, i see the miscommunication. no, i do want it to use the CD.
2010-08-25T08:39:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	yaaang	ahh, so you've added it then?
2010-08-25T08:40:00.000Z	yaaang	randomOfAmber	yeah
2010-08-25T08:46:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	yaaang	what kind of card do you have? (sudo lshw in a terminal)
2010-08-25T08:49:00.000Z	yaaang	randomOfAmber	i have a BCM4312
2010-08-25T08:50:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	yaaang	bad luck, I have a broadcom card too :( .  install broadcom-sta from synaptic or apt
2010-08-25T08:50:00.000Z	yaaang	randomOfAmber	oh, that's the wireless card - my ethernet controller is a BCM5761e
2010-08-25T08:52:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	yaaang	I think that's broadcom too, people have plenty of issues with their cards.  broadcom-sta should do it though (I think)
2010-08-25T08:52:00.000Z	yaaang	randomOfAmber	broadcom-sta-common?
2010-08-25T08:53:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	yaaang	yes
2010-08-25T08:53:00.000Z	yaaang	randomOfAmber	the package description says it only supports BCM4311/4312/4321/4322 wireless cards
2010-08-25T08:54:00.000Z	yaaang	randomOfAmber	my wireless is working, but my wired isn't
2010-08-25T08:55:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	yaaang	I'd google your card then.  past the output of "sudo lshw -C network" in google
