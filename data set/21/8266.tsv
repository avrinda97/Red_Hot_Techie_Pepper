2011-04-06T18:36:00.000Z	Combatjuan	ikonia	vim does have a diff feature.  I use it daily and it's awesome.  ":h diffthis"
2011-04-06T18:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Combatjuan	it's not a compile option
2011-04-06T18:37:00.000Z	Combatjuan	ikonia	It is.  ":version" -> it's the +diff option.
2011-04-06T18:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Combatjuan	doesn't show as a compile time optoion in 6.3, but I'll take your word
2011-04-06T18:38:00.000Z	Combatjuan	ikonia	Ah.  Yes.  It's 7.0 or later.  But 7.0 is about 5 years old, isn't it.

2011-04-28T01:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Combatjuan	#ubuntu-motu
2011-04-28T01:43:00.000Z	Combatjuan	ikonia	Thanks.  It wasn't showing up in my /list...?
2012-06-20T19:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Combatjuan	on the local host, try to login to alice or "su - alice"
2012-06-20T19:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Combatjuan	you shouldn't be able to ssh as root - the root account is disabled
2012-06-20T19:04:00.000Z	Combatjuan	ikonia	I can log as alice locally. (su - alice)
2012-06-20T19:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Combatjuan	are you using ubuntu ?
2012-06-20T19:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Combatjuan	do you have no non-privileged users on your system ?
2012-06-20T19:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Combatjuan	that's not what I asked
2012-06-20T19:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Combatjuan	do you have no other non-privileged accounts on the machine ?
2012-06-20T19:06:00.000Z	Combatjuan	ikonia	There are other users than alice, yes.
2012-06-20T19:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Combatjuan	ok, so become one, then "su - alice" and check the password
2012-06-20T19:06:00.000Z	Combatjuan	ikonia	It works.
2012-06-20T19:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Combatjuan	so you know the problem is with ssh
2012-06-20T19:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Combatjuan	check the ssh logs
2012-06-28T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Combatjuan	no
