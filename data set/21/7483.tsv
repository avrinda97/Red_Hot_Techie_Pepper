2006-09-20T05:53:00.000Z	exe-cuter	Chalkie1873	have you checked your network configuration?
2006-09-20T05:54:00.000Z	exe-cuter	Chalkie1873	can you ping google (or any other page)?
2006-09-20T05:55:00.000Z	exe-cuter	Chalkie1873	wlan or lan?
2006-09-20T05:56:00.000Z	exe-cuter	Chalkie1873	strange, but to go for sure, you have activated the lan network when you are on ubuntu live disk?
2006-09-20T05:57:00.000Z	exe-cuter	Chalkie1873	 ok
2006-09-20T05:59:00.000Z	exe-cuter	Chalkie1873	np, i've got plenty of time :D
2006-09-20T06:00:00.000Z	exe-cuter	Chalkie1873	normally when using the live disk the lan connection is already activated, but let's take a closer look
2006-09-20T06:03:00.000Z	exe-cuter	Chalkie1873	i'm on dualboot, got hd of 60 gb (10 gb ntfs winblow --only for photoshop & illustrator cuz i'm a designer ,, 40  gb fat32 to write from both linux and winblows ,,  5 gb ext3 for ubuntu)

2006-09-20T06:06:00.000Z	exe-cuter	Chalkie1873	ok, yet go to system => admin => network and see if your lan is activated
2006-09-20T06:07:00.000Z	exe-cuter	Chalkie1873	networking
2006-09-20T06:08:00.000Z	exe-cuter	Chalkie1873	np :D i can wait :D
