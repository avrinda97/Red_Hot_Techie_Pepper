2006-12-05T07:07:00.000Z	Randakar	solevita	First of all, 'drivers' are supposed to be part of either X or the linux kernel, not seperate downloads
2006-12-05T07:09:00.000Z	Randakar	solevita	Ok, does the card work? As in, do you have a desktop to start with?
2006-12-05T07:12:00.000Z	solevita	Randakar	   yes,   it works        BUT I got the feeling that the driver isn't configured right     or something..         lately I installed the KDE stuff      but as i wanted to try the transparency stuff for the window behaving settings   the computer says this: Composite extension not found
2006-12-05T07:13:00.000Z	Randakar	solevita	that's straightforward advice
2006-12-05T07:13:00.000Z	Randakar	solevita	trouble is, you have a driver, but not the proprietary one
2006-12-05T07:13:00.000Z	solevita	Randakar	  aha!
2006-12-05T07:14:00.000Z	Randakar	solevita	the X config file can be found in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-12-05T07:14:00.000Z	solevita	Randakar	  then let me take a look ;)
2006-12-05T07:14:00.000Z	Randakar	solevita	you can add those lines to enable the composite extension there, _but_ it doesn't neccesarily work without the non-free driver
2006-12-05T07:18:00.000Z	solevita	Randakar	   it's a bit embarresing but I can't find the xorg file   :(
2006-12-05T07:19:00.000Z	Randakar	solevita	try running 'gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
2006-12-05T07:22:00.000Z	solevita	Randakar	 yeah! now i understand!    thanks a lot!
2006-12-05T07:24:00.000Z	Randakar	solevita	you're welcome :-)
2006-12-05T07:31:00.000Z	Randakar	solevita	your problem is lack of openGL support in your video driver ;-)
2006-12-05T07:32:00.000Z	solevita	Randakar	    no, that's not it..  'cause on the box here it says:  that it DOES have Open GL     and some more stuff.. but tv-out and all that is not my thing
2006-12-05T07:33:00.000Z	Randakar	solevita	Your card supports it, the driver just doesn't know how to enable it
2006-12-05T07:33:00.000Z	solevita	Randakar	  I see..
2006-12-05T07:41:00.000Z	Randakar	solevita	Look for a set of ATI driver installation instructions on the net
2006-12-05T07:42:00.000Z	solevita	Randakar	  I'm on it ;)
