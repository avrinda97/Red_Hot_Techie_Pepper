2006-06-07T06:05:00.000Z	andi5	SillyRabbit	why that?
2006-06-07T06:06:00.000Z	SillyRabbit	andi5	- it does not have a "secure" mode like Trillian offers.....
2006-06-07T06:06:00.000Z	andi5	SillyRabbit	oh, there are plugins... but if you have trillian users you want to speak to within trillian, then you will _need_ trillian :)
2006-06-07T06:07:00.000Z	SillyRabbit	andi5	 y, that is why i am asking about trillian....you use it?  or ever get it to work in WINE ?
2006-06-07T06:08:00.000Z	andi5	SillyRabbit	i installed it once in windows, but it was just deinstalled just as fast
2006-06-07T06:09:00.000Z	SillyRabbit	andi5	 y, wine is an awesome concept but, it is very complicated and doesn't seem to work very well...
2006-06-07T06:09:00.000Z	andi5	SillyRabbit	awesome concept.... hm.... if you think that
2006-06-07T06:09:00.000Z	SillyRabbit	andi5	 ? yes ?
2006-06-07T06:10:00.000Z	SillyRabbit	andi5	 unless you know how to run ITUNES otherwise ? please let  me know....
2006-06-07T06:11:00.000Z	andi5	SillyRabbit	well, i do not need itunes, so no, i cannot..... btw, gotta leave, it is late
