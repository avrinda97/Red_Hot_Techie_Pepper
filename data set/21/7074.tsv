2006-12-05T09:27:00.000Z	soundray	ismail	you don't, if you can somehow avoid it.
2006-12-05T09:27:00.000Z	soundray	ismail	what do you want to install?
2006-12-05T09:28:00.000Z	soundray	ismail	before you follow Gumby, let me check something...
2006-12-05T09:29:00.000Z	soundray	ismail	googleearth has been packaged for ubuntu by PLF. Check http://packages.freecontrib.org/ubuntu/plf/dists/edgy-plf/non-free/
2006-12-05T09:29:00.000Z	soundray	ismail	do you know how to modify your sources.list?
2006-12-05T09:30:00.000Z	soundray	ismail	run 'gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list' and add the two typescript lines from the top of that page.
2006-12-05T09:31:00.000Z	soundray	ismail	then save the file and run 'sudo apt-get update', checking for any errors.
2006-12-05T09:32:00.000Z	soundray	ismail	if that has worked, you can then 'sudo apt-get install googleearth'
2006-12-05T09:34:00.000Z	ismail	soundray	it doesnt work its not supported
2006-12-05T09:34:00.000Z	soundray	ismail	are you on amd64?
