2011-01-09T18:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jenk	 theres one.. but i forget its name.. :) its not really reccomended to use it.
2011-01-09T18:23:00.000Z	Jenk	Dr_Willis	Any alternatives ?
2011-01-09T18:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jenk	 not that ive seen that you would want to  hand out debs built with it.. personal use perhaps...
2011-01-09T18:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jenk	 if you have never compiled somthing from source.. dont expect it to be a 'one click and you are done' sort of thing.
2011-01-09T18:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jenk	 short answer.. No. Theres to much variation.
2011-01-09T18:32:00.000Z	Jenk	Dr_Willis	The other solution ?
2011-01-09T18:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jenk	 for properly done source code theres a tool that can generate debs from them. but its a tool for personal use only.
2011-01-09T18:33:00.000Z	Jenk	Dr_Willis	What's the name ?

2011-04-13T23:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jenk	 add a fstab entry. that url gives examples.. or use the ntfs-config tool
2011-04-13T23:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jenk	 0 and 0 i think for the most part are used there.
2011-04-13T23:18:00.000Z	Jenk	Dr_Willis	eblume, Umm, I think that should be it. Thank you very much. :)
2011-04-13T23:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jenk	 the ntfs-3g homepage has dozens of examples also  and use for differnt options
2011-04-13T23:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jenk	 rember you cant chown/chmod files on the ntfs filesystmes either. :) people often forget that.
2011-04-13T23:22:00.000Z	Jenk	Dr_Willis	I have absolutely no idea what chown/chmod does but I'll find out... Thanks for the pointer.
