2006-12-20T16:51:00.000Z	Aggrav8d		hello, everyone.  how do i change the default bash so that vi understand arrow keys, insert, etc?
2006-12-20T16:51:00.000Z	Aggrav8d		maybe even color codes things?
2006-12-20T16:51:00.000Z	Aggrav8d		i'm running 6.10
2006-12-20T16:52:00.000Z	jrib	Aggrav8d	install vim-full and use that
2006-12-20T16:52:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	jrib	- thanks
2006-12-20T16:52:00.000Z	jrib	Aggrav8d	ubuntu ships with vim-tiny by default which is a bit limited.  I think that's what you are noticing
2006-12-20T16:52:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	jrib	- vim-full? are you sure that's the package name?
2006-12-20T16:53:00.000Z	jrib	Aggrav8d	you'll need universe it seems
2006-12-20T16:54:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	jrib	- wierd, i tried to apt-get install vim-full and it just gave me a message about no installation candidate.
2006-12-20T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	Aggrav8d	probably means you haven't enabled universe
2007-01-17T16:44:00.000Z	jrib	Aggrav8d	no backups?
2007-01-17T16:45:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	jrib	- apparently no.
2007-01-17T16:45:00.000Z	jrib	Aggrav8d	that's the biggest mistake.  I think we all make it until something like this happens, just take it as motivation to have backups from now on
2007-01-20T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	Aggrav8d	sudo a2enmod
2007-01-20T06:58:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	jrib	- thanks
2007-01-20T07:01:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	jrib	- disk_cache, file_cache, mem_cache... I don't know which one is right for me :T
2007-01-20T07:01:00.000Z	jrib	Aggrav8d	I have just "cache" too I have no idea what any of them are though
2010-01-09T08:25:00.000Z	jrib	Aggrav8d	www-data
2010-03-18T03:59:00.000Z	jrib	Aggrav8d	vmware is one option
2010-03-18T03:59:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	jrib	- i'd still like to be able to play some of th newer games.  what do you recommend?
2010-03-18T04:00:00.000Z	jrib	Aggrav8d	boot windows
