2010-03-25T23:31:00.000Z	blakkheim		what would i use to format and use the 2TB WD20EADS hard drive? it's not showing up in fdisk -l
2010-03-25T23:32:00.000Z	jimcooncat	blakkheim	gparted with partition and format for you
2010-03-25T23:33:00.000Z	blakkheim	jimcooncat	it doesn't show up in gparted
2010-03-25T23:35:00.000Z	jimcooncat	blakkheim	if that doesn't work the cable may be bad

2010-03-25T23:36:00.000Z	blakkheim	jimcooncat	also "[51134.192904] scsi 7:0:0:0: Device offlined - not ready after error recover"
2010-03-25T23:37:00.000Z	jimcooncat	blakkheim	what does lsusb say at this point?

2010-03-25T23:39:00.000Z	blakkheim	jimcooncat	i will try something else, brb
2010-03-25T23:45:00.000Z	jimcooncat	blakkheim	I looked around, and didn't find many complaints about that device
2010-03-26T00:04:00.000Z	blakkheim	jimcooncat	you were the one i talked to about the 2tb drive right?
2010-03-26T00:05:00.000Z	blakkheim	jimcooncat	well the usb dock is fine, i just tested it with another sata drive and it was fine
2010-03-26T00:06:00.000Z	blakkheim	jimcooncat	so then i put the 2tb drive in the computer and now gparted recognizes it. but i went to format it and it's taking quite a long time, still not done
2010-03-26T00:07:00.000Z	jimcooncat	blakkheim	if you didn't partition it, ext3 would take a long time
2010-03-26T00:07:00.000Z	blakkheim	jimcooncat	what would you suggest instead of ext3? (and why does it take so long specifically?)
2010-03-26T00:08:00.000Z	blakkheim	jimcooncat	also (it just finished) now it says 25gb of it is in use, what's up with that?
2010-03-26T00:08:00.000Z	jimcooncat	blakkheim	I wouldn't suggest anything different. ext3 goes through your hd. reiserfs, for example, would format it in seconds -- but you still would have to run badblocks
2010-03-26T00:09:00.000Z	jimcooncat	blakkheim	perhaps it carved out the 25 gb for the journal?
2010-03-26T00:09:00.000Z	blakkheim	jimcooncat	ouch, so that's normal?
2010-03-26T00:09:00.000Z	jimcooncat	blakkheim	it's been a while since I've been into that, I'm rusty
2010-03-26T00:10:00.000Z	blakkheim	jimcooncat	gdb: alright, i'll see if everything's working and come back if i have any more problems, thanks
