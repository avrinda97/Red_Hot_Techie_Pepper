2009-04-20T12:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sleepy_cat	Either remove that line entirely or replace "force" with "user" ( you should never force a mount unless it's read only )
2009-04-20T12:12:00.000Z	sleepy_cat		ohh ok
2009-04-20T12:12:00.000Z	sleepy_cat	Jordan_U	 I didnt know that.. I just tried whatever was written below the failed mount message
