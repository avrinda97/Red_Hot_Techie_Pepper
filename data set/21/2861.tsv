2011-02-22T01:29:00.000Z	moparisthebest		my root partition just went read only, can I safely run an fsck on it while the system is running on it read only?
2011-02-22T01:30:00.000Z	moparisthebest		so how do I run one then?  It's a server, so I can't use a livecd
2011-02-22T01:31:00.000Z	moparisthebest		this is the error:
2011-02-22T01:31:00.000Z	moparisthebest		[3333860.011409] EXT3-fs error (device md4): ext3_get_inode_loc: unable to read inode block - inode=29545028, block=118161702
2011-02-22T01:31:00.000Z	mkanyicy	moparisthebest	try 'sudo mount / -o rw,remount && sudo touch /forcefsck && sudo reboot'
2011-02-22T01:32:00.000Z	mkanyicy	moparisthebest	ok then reboot into the recovery mode  and fsck
2011-02-22T01:35:00.000Z	mkanyicy	moparisthebest	try to restart your computer again without doing anything and see if ever it still comes readonly or not
2011-02-22T01:35:00.000Z	moparisthebest	mkanyicy	but then I run the risk of it not coming up at all
2011-02-22T01:36:00.000Z	mkanyicy	moparisthebest	oh boy, good luck then
2011-02-22T01:59:00.000Z	mkanyicy	moparisthebest	how did it go?
2011-02-22T01:59:00.000Z	moparisthebest	mkanyicy	i'm backing up everything to another disk as we speak
2011-02-22T02:00:00.000Z	mkanyicy	moparisthebest	do yo have beagle?
2011-02-22T02:00:00.000Z	mkanyicy	moparisthebest	even beagle can make a fs to remount as ro
2011-02-22T02:01:00.000Z	mkanyicy	moparisthebest	honestly i think you are operating on paranoid mode which is good ... but can all in vain
2011-02-22T02:02:00.000Z	moparisthebest	mkanyicy	like I said, I've had this happen once in the past, rebooted, and everything was gone :P
2011-02-22T02:02:00.000Z	mkanyicy	moparisthebest	anyway making a backup is always the best
2011-02-22T02:02:00.000Z	mkanyicy	moparisthebest	I agree
2011-02-22T02:03:00.000Z	mkanyicy	moparisthebest	at least that is not too bad
2011-02-22T02:03:00.000Z	mkanyicy	moparisthebest	than losing everything
2011-02-22T02:03:00.000Z	mkanyicy	moparisthebest	funny i never gone through those emotions when i encountered this problem over n over
2011-02-22T02:04:00.000Z	mkanyicy	moparisthebest	i dont backup
