2006-07-14T07:34:00.000Z	abhinay		problem installing gaim-vv , i did ./configure,  error i got was...   Could not run GLIB test program, checking why...  The test program failed to compile or link. See the file config.log for the exact error that occurred. This usually means GLIB is incorrectly installed. configure: error: GLib 2.0 is required to build Gaim; please make sure you have the GLib development headers installed.

2006-07-19T10:33:00.000Z	gregg__	abhinay	strange, maybe your vcd is not ok? give vlc a try
2006-07-19T10:33:00.000Z	abhinay	gregg__	not playing in vlc also
2006-07-19T10:34:00.000Z	gregg__	abhinay	in this I'd say the vcd or your drive is to be blamed... you might want to check permissions to your cd/dvd device thoough
2006-07-19T10:34:00.000Z	gregg__	abhinay	check whether it works as root (sudo=

2006-07-19T10:36:00.000Z	gregg__	abhinay	vcd broken... they use a less safe scheme for error correction than data cd-roms
2006-07-19T10:37:00.000Z	abhinay	gregg__	is there any way to copy it ...
2006-07-19T10:39:00.000Z	gregg__	abhinay	dd with conv=noerror,sync
