2006-04-09T07:31:00.000Z	CharlieSu		New release coming out this month..  Is there a changelog available?
2006-04-09T07:31:00.000Z	bimberi	CharlieSu	dapper has been delayed ...
2006-11-17T06:57:00.000Z	bimberi	CharlieSu	squid
2006-11-17T06:57:00.000Z	CharlieSu	bimberi	squid the standard?
2006-11-17T06:58:00.000Z	bimberi	CharlieSu	i would say so ... and it's in main
2006-11-27T08:41:00.000Z	bimberi	CharlieSu	does 'df' show it as mounted? if so, is /media/cdrom the mountpoint?
2006-12-05T17:09:00.000Z	bimberi	CharlieSu	You can use evolution to read the mail, or install "mailx" to get the classic CLI mail client.  You shouldn't need anything else (after postfix) to send mail
2006-12-05T17:10:00.000Z	CharlieSu	bimberi	so postfix recieves mail from the internet and also sends mail out to the internet?
2006-12-05T17:13:00.000Z	bimberi	CharlieSu	yes, that's my experience.
2006-12-05T17:14:00.000Z	CharlieSu	bimberi	ok.. i'll see if i have this figured out then..
2006-12-05T17:23:00.000Z	CharlieSu	bimberi	so for people to email me the only port i need to open would be 25 correct?  what would 110 be for?
2006-12-05T17:35:00.000Z	bimberi	CharlieSu	(sorry got called away) yes that's right.  Installing postfix opens port 25 (it might only be open to localhost I'm not sure) port 110 is pop3 which is used if you run a mailserver (dovecot for example) to allow people to collect mail remotely
2006-12-05T17:36:00.000Z	CharlieSu	bimberi	so if nobody needs to collect it remotely then i'm good..  for example if i use squirrelmail i wouldn't need that
2006-12-05T17:36:00.000Z	CharlieSu	bimberi	also..  my postfix file says mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8, does that mean i will not get mail from outside?
2006-12-05T17:41:00.000Z	bimberi	CharlieSu	if i've got it right, that means that only local users can use postfix to send mail (so you won't be a spam gateway).  receiving is another issue.  do a 'sudo netstat -plunt' and see if it is listening on 0.0.0.0:25
2006-12-05T17:43:00.000Z	bimberi	CharlieSu	I'm fairly sure that by default, postfix is set up to receive mail from outside, but it will only accept it for local users
2006-12-05T17:45:00.000Z	CharlieSu	bimberi	it is listening..
2006-12-05T17:45:00.000Z	CharlieSu	bimberi	how can i make sure it will only accept mail for local users?  the main.cf file doesn't have man options by default
2006-12-05T17:48:00.000Z	bimberi	CharlieSu	sorry, that i'm really not sure about.  Either someone else here knows postfix config better than I or it's to the Doco for you :)
2006-12-05T17:48:00.000Z	CharlieSu	bimberi	Doco for me lol.. thanks bud.. you have helped out a lot
2006-12-05T17:48:00.000Z	bimberi	CharlieSu	cool :)
