2006-01-28T07:09:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m		hi, sorry this is a tad off-topic, but does anyone know about msn protocols? friend has found this http://www.block-checker.com/ and wants to know if it's a scam or if it really is possible to find who's blocked you
2006-01-28T07:09:00.000Z	pixelfairy	sexcopter8000m	why dont you just try it? maybe with ethereal running
2006-01-28T07:10:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	pixelfairy	using wine?
2006-01-28T07:10:00.000Z	pixelfairy	sexcopter8000m	gaim might be easier
2006-01-28T07:11:00.000Z	pixelfairy		oh its a desktop app
2006-01-28T07:11:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	pixelfairy	if it is a loads of crap and is loaded with spyware for windoz users, am i as an ubuntu user safe from all that?
2006-01-28T07:11:00.000Z	pixelfairy	sexcopter8000m	or using qemu or vmware
2006-01-28T07:11:00.000Z	pixelfairy	sexcopter8000m	thats why you do it in a virtual machine
2006-01-28T07:12:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m		ok, pixelfairy, but i've *never* used vmware or qemu, is it easy and intuitive?
2006-01-28T07:12:00.000Z	pixelfairy	sexcopter8000m	if theres a way to tell, then the right traffic would probably show up on sniffer anyway
2006-01-28T07:12:00.000Z	pixelfairy	sexcopter8000m	both are pretty easy, vmware would be better for this
2006-01-28T07:13:00.000Z	pixelfairy		qemu is slow on disk access
2006-01-28T07:13:00.000Z	pixelfairy		which makes installing windows slow
2006-01-28T07:14:00.000Z	pixelfairy	sexcopter8000m	theres probably an easier safer way to check. and if msn finds out, they would probalby fix it anyway
2006-01-28T07:14:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	pixelfairy	oh i see lol, it entails installing a virtual windows system... well i'm tight on hdd space at the moment, so i can't right now
2006-01-28T07:14:00.000Z	pixelfairy		that kinda thing really should be server side
2006-01-28T07:15:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m		just asked in #gaim and someone's pointed out that since msn messenger version 6, everyone who's not on your list is blocked
2006-01-28T07:15:00.000Z	pixelfairy	sexcopter8000m	make a new msn in gaim and see what happens when you block yourself, then try to talk to the blocked name or something and see what the sniffer or gaims debugging output tells you. ethereal is good at decoding that stuff
2006-01-28T07:17:00.000Z	pixelfairy	sexcopter8000m	blockchecker looks pretty full of it
2006-01-28T07:18:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	pixelfairy	what do you mean? full of crap?
