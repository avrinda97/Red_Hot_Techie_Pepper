2010-10-10T20:21:00.000Z	trism	OpenSourcedNick	actually yes, there is a new alert bash alias in maverick, if you clean installed you should already have it, otherwise you can copy it to your ~/.bashrc from /etc/skel/.bashrc, it lets you run commands like: command; alert; and it will send a desktop notification when it completes
2010-10-10T20:24:00.000Z	OpenSourcedNick	trism	I copied the file to ~/.bashrc, what do I do now?
2010-10-10T20:25:00.000Z	trism	OpenSourcedNick	start a new terminal, check the command: alias; to make sure you have the alert alias, then run a command: command; alert; , replacing command with the command you want to run, like wget http://www.something.com/somefile; alert
2010-10-10T20:26:00.000Z	OpenSourcedNick	trism	too many times the word command was mentioned in that sentence
2010-10-10T20:27:00.000Z	trism	OpenSourcedNick	yes, I agree, sorry, just paste "; alert" to the end of your terminal command, without the quotes
2010-10-10T20:28:00.000Z	OpenSourcedNick	trism	alert command not found
2010-10-10T20:28:00.000Z	trism	OpenSourcedNick	source your ~/.bashrc first, or start a new terminal; . ~/.bashrc
2010-10-10T20:28:00.000Z	trism	OpenSourcedNick	and run: alias; to make sure you have the alert alias
2010-10-10T20:29:00.000Z	OpenSourcedNick	trism	I don't have alert alias
2010-10-10T20:30:00.000Z	OpenSourcedNick	trism	I don't want to bug you too much, if you have a page that guides for that I'll try it on my own :)
2010-10-10T20:31:00.000Z	trism	OpenSourcedNick	I don't have any guides, I got the info from this bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bash/+bug/315932
2010-10-10T20:32:00.000Z	trism	OpenSourcedNick	you need this alias: http://pastebin.com/dYzm5t32 in your ~/.bashrc, and you probably need libnotify-bin installed too, because that has notify-send
2010-10-10T20:33:00.000Z	trism	OpenSourcedNick	then you can test it with: sleep 10; alert
2010-10-10T20:40:00.000Z	OpenSourcedNick	trism	the line you told me to write in the .bashrc responds "-I not found", "terminal not found"...
2010-10-10T20:42:00.000Z	trism	OpenSourcedNick	would you mind posting your ~/.bashrc to pastebin?
2010-10-10T20:42:00.000Z	OpenSourcedNick	trism	it's ok I fixed it
2010-10-10T20:43:00.000Z	OpenSourcedNick	trism	http://pastebin.com/i69dxRDe I used this one
2010-10-10T20:53:00.000Z	trism	OpenSourcedNick	oh, I see my error, yes, sorry, it was a quoting problem when I sent it to pastebin
2010-10-10T20:56:00.000Z	OpenSourcedNick	trism	http://pastebin.com/byD6djF3 sorry for the delay
