2012-02-13T10:21:00.000Z	escott	dwade09_	lsmod | grep vid and then try and rmmod the relevant drivers

2012-02-13T10:24:00.000Z	dwade09_	escott	 done.
2012-02-13T10:24:00.000Z	escott	dwade09_	no if it worked the light would have already gone off
2012-02-13T10:25:00.000Z	escott	dwade09_	you could blacklist the module in /etc
2012-02-13T10:25:00.000Z	escott	dwade09_	maybe if its never loaded the hardware will never be turned on
2012-02-13T10:26:00.000Z	dwade09_	escott	 can you whisper me the directions to blacklist it?

2012-02-13T10:30:00.000Z	dwade09_	escott	 here is the big question, i have a blackberry 9300 curve, any way when i hook it to my laptop it will let me trade files from the blackberry to the laptop and vise versa?
