2008-02-25T21:48:00.000Z	neeto		I am trying to run MAME, and even with no controller/keyboard plugged in, something seems to be stuck pointing up, because when I get into the menu, the selection is scrolling to the next item faster and faster, and it accellerates. This seems to happen on xmame, sgl-mame, xmess and even the windows version of mame running over wine. does anyone have any ideas as to how to fix this?
2008-02-25T21:48:00.000Z	Slart	neeto	sounds like it think's a joystick is attached perhaps
2008-02-25T21:49:00.000Z	neeto	Slart	I've run mame with and without the -joystick flag, it seems to make no difference
2008-02-25T21:49:00.000Z	Slart	neeto	it was just a guess.. I've never run mame myself.. just sounded like a joystick problem
2008-02-25T21:49:00.000Z	neeto	Slart	No worries, thanks though. I'll try #mame
2008-03-01T03:22:00.000Z	Slart	neeto	there are some keymap options in System, Preferences, Keyboard. See if you find anything useful there
2008-06-27T15:35:00.000Z	Slart	neeto	afaik mtab is just a simple output of the current status.. fstab is where the configuration is done
2008-06-27T15:37:00.000Z	neeto	Slart	I see, well riddle me this: Depending on what devices I have plugged in at one time, sometimes a certain drive isn't always in, say /dev/sdc1. In this case, is there a way to identify the drive by a unique hardware address?
2008-06-27T15:38:00.000Z	Slart	neeto	correct.. that's why you can identify a drive by UUID instead of device file.. type !uuid for more info, sudo blkid to get a list of uuids
2008-10-07T01:21:00.000Z	Slart	neeto	I don't know if "eject" does things differently.. worth a try, perhaps
2009-01-13T05:15:00.000Z	Slart	neeto	have you checked the man page? I think there's a switch
2009-01-13T05:15:00.000Z	neeto	Slart	checked, but I didn't see one
2009-01-13T05:16:00.000Z	neeto	Slart	ah yeah, you're right... it's worded differently than I had expected it to be.
2009-01-13T05:16:00.000Z	Slart	neeto	you could try -u
2009-01-13T05:16:00.000Z	Slart	neeto	it will still overwrite if the filer you're copying is newer..
2009-01-13T05:18:00.000Z	Slart	neeto	if you want more options when moving files you can often use rsync instead of cp/mv..
2009-01-13T05:19:00.000Z	neeto	Slart	I've never used rsync... I am backing up my music from one harddrive to another, you think it would work a lot better in this situation?
2009-01-13T05:20:00.000Z	Slart	neeto	it wont be faster or anything.. but rsync has some extra bling bling.. progress bars and such.. and I think it can copy only if the destination doesn't exist like you were asking for
2009-01-13T05:21:00.000Z	neeto	Slart	sweet, progress bars are awesome.
2009-01-13T05:21:00.000Z	Slart	neeto	I can't really say I know rsyncs syntax by heart..but I don't think you need to be a rocket scientist to use it
2009-01-13T05:21:00.000Z	neeto	Slart	naw it looks fine, I can figure it out.
