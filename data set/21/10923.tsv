I am using the ubuntu live cd, it looks like the partition where the fie is is mounted on hda5, but it isnt writeable, what is the command to make it writeable drive?
2005-06-05T12:54:00.000Z	bob2	Llamabutcher	if it's ntfs, you can't
2005-06-05T12:54:00.000Z	bob2	Llamabutcher	unless you install captive-ntfs
2005-06-05T12:55:00.000Z	Llamabutcher	bob2	is that strictly for the live version?
2005-06-05T12:55:00.000Z	bob2	Llamabutcher	no, it's a general linux thing
2005-06-05T12:55:00.000Z	bob2	Llamabutcher	apt-get works on the live cd, yes
2005-06-05T12:56:00.000Z	Llamabutcher	bob2	is the actual package called captive-ntfs?
2005-06-05T12:56:00.000Z	bob2	Llamabutcher	no
2005-06-05T12:58:00.000Z	Llamabutcher	bob2	what is the command to install captive-ntfs
2005-06-05T12:59:00.000Z	bob2	Llamabutcher	there are lots of them
2005-06-05T13:07:00.000Z	bob2	Llamabutcher	did you configure the network yet?
2005-06-05T13:09:00.000Z	bob2	Llamabutcher	you can ping google.com?
2005-06-05T13:12:00.000Z	Llamabutcher	bob2	yes I can ping www.google.com
2005-06-05T13:13:00.000Z	Llamabutcher	bob2	what difference does it make if i can ping www.google.com?
2005-06-05T13:14:00.000Z	bob2	Llamabutcher	that means your network at least somewhat works
2005-06-05T13:15:00.000Z	bob2	Llamabutcher	could do
2005-06-05T13:17:00.000Z	bob2	Llamabutcher	sudo apt-setup
2005-06-05T13:21:00.000Z	Llamabutcher	bob2	what should i type into the ftp mirror in apt-setup? I can only find http ones
2005-06-05T13:21:00.000Z	bob2	Llamabutcher	you can't use http?
2005-06-05T13:23:00.000Z	Llamabutcher	bob2	i dunno... what else could this message mean? E: Method http has died unexpectedly!
2005-06-05T13:24:00.000Z	bob2	Llamabutcher	perhaps that the cd is broken, or the network connection or the apt config or ...
