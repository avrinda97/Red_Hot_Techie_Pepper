2008-12-05T19:11:00.000Z	sipior	ksbalaji_	and just what are the permissions on the directory .gnupg? they should be rwx------, i believe.
2008-12-05T19:15:00.000Z	ksbalaji_	sipior	got disconnected! any idea?

2008-12-05T19:16:00.000Z	sipior	ksbalaji_	yes, i asked what the permissions were on the directory .gnupg. they should be rwx------.
2008-12-05T19:16:00.000Z	ksbalaji_	sipior	yes.
2008-12-05T19:17:00.000Z	sipior	ksbalaji_	yes? do you mean that the permissions of the directory .gnupg are, in fact, rwx------?
2008-12-05T19:19:00.000Z	ksbalaji_	sipior	I right clicked on .gnupg and hit properties>permissions. I see root create and delete files.
2008-12-05T19:20:00.000Z	sipior	ksbalaji_	try this: open up a terminal, and type "ls -ld .gnupg"
2008-12-05T19:20:00.000Z	sipior	ksbalaji_	to be more specific, "ls -ld ${HOME}/.gnupg"
2008-12-05T19:21:00.000Z	ksbalaji_	sipior	drwxrwxr-x 2 root balaji 4096 2008-12-05 18:41 .gnupg
2008-12-05T19:22:00.000Z	ksbalaji_	sipior	drwxrwxr-x 2 root balaji 4096 2008-12-05 18:41 /home/balaji/.gnupg
2008-12-05T19:22:00.000Z	sipior	ksbalaji_	yeah that's...incorrect. two things: you don't want user root owning the directory, and the permissions are not nearly restrictive enough. try this: "sudo chown -R balaji .gnupg", and then "chmod 700 .gnupg"
2008-12-05T19:25:00.000Z	ksbalaji_	sipior	now drwx------ 2 balaji balaji 4096 2008-12-05 18:41 /home/balaji/.gnupg
2008-12-05T19:25:00.000Z	sipior	ksbalaji_	work any better?
2008-12-05T19:26:00.000Z	ksbalaji_	sipior	can I now proceed with my original no GPG public key rectification now?
2008-12-05T19:26:00.000Z	sipior	ksbalaji_	give it a try
2008-12-05T19:32:00.000Z	sipior	ksbalaji_	did that change work for you?
2008-12-05T19:33:00.000Z	ksbalaji_	sipior	Hey! you are great! that solved my problem. I could update without errors now. Do I have to change back the permissions now?
2008-12-05T19:34:00.000Z	sipior	ksbalaji_	don't change them back, unless you want it to break again :) glad you have it working.
2008-12-05T19:34:00.000Z	ksbalaji_	sipior	thank you! have a nice day/night! and bye!
