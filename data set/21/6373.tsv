2008-04-25T02:29:00.000Z	ceil420		how long does it usually take for the new ubuntu version to be attainable from update-manager?
2008-04-25T02:29:00.000Z	arbrandes	ceil420	you mean, after the servers aren't so bogged down? Dunno, a few days?
2008-04-25T02:30:00.000Z	ceil420	arbrandes	i mean until it stops telling me that i'm up to date and won't even offer the download :x i'd take it at 20kb/s
2008-04-25T02:30:00.000Z	arbrandes	ceil420	it should be available now
2008-04-25T02:30:00.000Z	arbrandes	ceil420	the problem might be that the servers are so bogged down that you're not getting the latest version of update-manager.
2008-04-25T02:30:00.000Z	ceil420	arbrandes	bah, knew i shoulda got the RC a few days ago ><
2008-04-25T02:31:00.000Z	arbrandes	ceil420	well, there are lotsa RC folks complaining that they can't get the release version for the same reason, so... :)
2008-04-25T02:31:00.000Z	arbrandes	ceil420	I recommend getting the DVD torrent and upgrading from it: http://www.acc.umu.se/~mighty/ubuntu/ubuntu-8.04-dvd-i386.iso.torrentW
2008-04-25T02:31:00.000Z	arbrandes	ceil420	or rather: http://www.acc.umu.se/~mighty/ubuntu/ubuntu-8.04-dvd-i386.iso.torrent
2008-04-25T02:31:00.000Z	ceil420	arbrandes	i'd be happy with RC; all i really wanna do is update libconfuse so i can install awesome wm :x
2008-04-25T02:31:00.000Z	ceil420	arbrandes	also, i don't have a dvd drive
2008-04-25T02:32:00.000Z	arbrandes	ceil420	no need for a DVD drive.  Just get the iso and mount it via loop device.
2008-04-25T02:32:00.000Z	ceil420	arbrandes	no room for a dvd iso :x
2008-04-25T02:32:00.000Z	arbrandes	ceil420	then again, you could always upgrade from the alternate cd torrent.  It's there, too: http://www.acc.umu.se/~mighty/ubuntu/
2008-04-25T02:33:00.000Z	arbrandes	ceil420	beware that there might be packages that need to be downloaded from the net, if using the alternate cd.  That's what I'm doing, by the way.
2008-04-25T02:34:00.000Z	ceil420	arbrandes	i don't wanna fight with it, i'll just wait for a nice 'n' easy update-manager download :p if apt-get update will hurry up :x
2008-04-25T02:38:00.000Z	arbrandes	ceil420	lol
2008-04-25T02:41:00.000Z	ceil420	arbrandes	i wasn't :p
2008-04-25T02:42:00.000Z	arbrandes	ceil420	(me neither, but don't tell anyone)
2008-04-25T02:50:00.000Z	ceil420	arbrandes	apt-get remove has never failed me :o
2008-04-25T02:50:00.000Z	arbrandes	ceil420	well, until relatively recently it would not auto-remove unused packages.
