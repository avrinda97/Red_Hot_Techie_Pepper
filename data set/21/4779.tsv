2008-02-18T10:49:00.000Z	ph0rensic	nickrud	Hey question.. say I already dualboot and I wanna give the 64-bit version a go. I already have my drives partitioned and everything... When I install the 2nd linux operating system on my machine, does GRUB reconfigure for me automatically to show the new 64-but kernel?
2008-02-18T10:51:00.000Z	ph0rensic	nickrud	Did you get my last message to you?
2008-02-18T10:51:00.000Z	nickrud	ph0rensic	mised it
2008-02-18T10:52:00.000Z	nickrud	ph0rensic	yes, it does
2008-02-18T10:52:00.000Z	ph0rensic	nickrud	So then when os would be in charge of grub, the new one or the first installed one?
2008-02-18T10:53:00.000Z	nickrud	ph0rensic	the last installed os
2008-02-18T10:53:00.000Z	ph0rensic	nickrud	That is what I was thinking .. ok thanks
2008-02-18T10:54:00.000Z	nickrud	ph0rensic	if you want a different one to do it, while that os is active do  sudo grub-install /dev/hda (or sda)
2008-02-18T10:55:00.000Z	nickrud	ph0rensic	um,  sudo update-grub && sudo grub-install /dev/<device> that is, so all the os's will be listed
2008-02-18T10:55:00.000Z	ph0rensic	nickrud	got it thanks bro
2008-02-19T09:56:00.000Z	ph0rensic	nickrud	he has the latest libdvd and all that?
2008-02-19T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	ph0rensic	yes, it's not even seeing his dvd's. None of them are. Errors opening them
2008-02-19T12:02:00.000Z	ph0rensic	nickrud	Is there a preferred file system to use for setting up a share that ubuntu users and windows users can access?

2008-02-19T12:06:00.000Z	nickrud	ph0rensic	sorry, I forgot to answer. On the same machine? ntfs is good enough, you can use fs-driver.org for ext2 if you like. samba for between machines
2008-03-02T10:09:00.000Z	nickrud	ph0rensic	hi
2008-03-02T10:17:00.000Z	ph0rensic	nickrud	I suggested the proprietary driver manager
2008-03-02T10:17:00.000Z	nickrud	ph0rensic	good choice
2008-03-02T10:18:00.000Z	ph0rensic	nickrud	he said he did it that way but the 3d test failed..? ATI...
2008-03-02T10:30:00.000Z	nickrud	ph0rensic	I let floodbot be the arbiter of that these days. The uber-ops set that :)
2008-03-02T10:31:00.000Z	ph0rensic	nickrud	hehe ;-)
