2008-04-14T19:23:00.000Z	harsh1		My Network usage always reports, I am uploading 217 kb/s and I am receiving 391 Kb/s (varies evry time), even if my computer is idle in Ubuntu 7.10?
2008-04-14T19:24:00.000Z	Sturmeh	harsh1	is this "Local Network" or "Internet" usage?
2008-04-14T19:24:00.000Z	Sturmeh		got no idea jamiejackson ( as to where they are stored )
2008-04-14T19:26:00.000Z	harsh1	Sturmeh	I am chcking this in System Monitor utility in Resources Tab.
2008-04-14T19:27:00.000Z	Sturmeh	harsh1	do you have a home network?
2008-04-14T19:27:00.000Z	harsh1	Sturmeh	No
2008-04-14T19:28:00.000Z	Sturmeh	harsh1	check your isp usage and make sure you haven't been using "alot" or anything, it's probably local throughput.
2008-04-14T19:28:00.000Z	Sturmeh	harsh1	i take you aren't downloading updates or anything when you are "idle"
2008-04-14T19:29:00.000Z	harsh1	Sturmeh	No, none of the programs that uses Internet like Torrent clients etc are running.
2008-04-14T19:30:00.000Z	Sturmeh	harsh1	disconnect your internet cables for a moment and see if the activity stops, and if anything produces an error etc.
2008-04-14T19:30:00.000Z	Sturmeh	harsh1	and then come back ofcause
2008-04-14T19:30:00.000Z	harsh1	Sturmeh	ok, but one question before disconnecting.
2008-04-14T19:31:00.000Z	Sturmeh		as many as you like harsh1
2008-04-14T19:31:00.000Z	Sturmeh		thats the one
2008-04-14T19:32:00.000Z	harsh1	Sturmeh	What information will be displayed in the System Monitor->Resources(Tab)->Network History->(Received, sent)?
2008-04-14T19:33:00.000Z	Sturmeh		google the error Morydd refrain from repeating it here
2008-04-14T19:33:00.000Z	Sturmeh	harsh1	not sure what you mean, it logs network activity.
2008-04-14T19:34:00.000Z	Sturmeh		u google errors
2008-04-14T19:34:00.000Z	Sturmeh		it's very unlikely someone in here has encountered the same error message and remembers it
2008-04-14T19:34:00.000Z	Sturmeh		if they have they would have said it already
2008-04-14T19:34:00.000Z	harsh1	Sturmeh	I was asking this question because this is the place where it is showing Sent=317 Kb/s and received=117 kb/s, is this normal?
