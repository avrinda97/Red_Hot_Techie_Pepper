2007-02-25T06:21:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	yes
2007-02-25T06:21:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	I use ssh
2007-02-25T06:21:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	Places> Connect to Server, then use your network IP adress
2007-02-25T06:22:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	that is if both linux run linux, otherwise you should use samba
2007-02-25T06:22:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	yes
2007-02-25T06:22:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	try finding something similar to Connect to a server in KDE...
2007-02-25T06:23:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	just a sec ;-)
2007-02-25T06:27:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	can't seem to find a graphical interface for that, but you can always use samba...
2007-02-25T06:43:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	i haven't...
2007-02-25T06:44:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	but you can do it manually

2007-02-25T06:45:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	it will show as a normal folder in your file manager
2007-02-25T06:46:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	alternatively, you could use Samba
2007-02-25T06:46:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	try ifconfig on your computers, this should give you your local IP adress
2007-02-25T06:48:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	ifconfig |grep inet
2007-02-25T07:06:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	put sudo in front
2007-02-25T07:09:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	TRY USING SUDO
2007-02-25T07:10:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	nope, I used the graphical interface
2007-02-25T07:11:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	to connect remotely, I used the tool that exists in Gnome
2007-02-25T07:12:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	lesshaste	yes I know, ive never set up fuse
