2009-06-05T15:44:00.000Z	Macfudd1		I removed and installed Deluge because it was stuck on something, and the GUI changed completely. also the second install required deluge-torrent-common where I only had deluge-torrent before
2009-06-05T15:45:00.000Z	nikola	Macfudd1	maybe it had themes installed? or it's a new release
2009-06-05T15:45:00.000Z	Macfudd1	nikola	it seems to have gone backwards
2009-06-05T15:46:00.000Z	nikola	Macfudd1	hmm... what do you mean "backwards"?
2009-06-05T15:47:00.000Z	Macfudd1	nikola	the GUI was much sleeker and user-friendly before. it had more options and better precision
2009-06-05T15:47:00.000Z	nikola		Hmm, maybe they changed it in the new version?
2009-06-05T15:48:00.000Z	nikola	Macfudd1	Hmm, maybe they changed it in the new version? (that answer was for yeh)
2009-06-05T15:48:00.000Z	Macfudd1		why would they make it worse?
2009-06-05T15:48:00.000Z	Macfudd1		there's no improvement though
2009-06-05T15:49:00.000Z	Macfudd1		and what of the  -common thing
2009-06-05T15:49:00.000Z	nikola	Macfudd1	you maybe had themes installed for it?
2009-06-05T15:50:00.000Z	Macfudd1		I don't remember ever installing a theme
2009-06-05T15:50:00.000Z	nikola		Hmm
2009-06-05T15:50:00.000Z	Macfudd1		and there were more options
2009-06-05T15:50:00.000Z	Macfudd1		better features
2009-06-05T15:50:00.000Z	nikola		One question, did you install it from Manager or from a website?
2009-06-05T15:53:00.000Z	Macfudd1	nikola	synaptic
2009-06-05T15:53:00.000Z	nikola	Macfudd1	try teh Add/remove option
2009-06-05T15:53:00.000Z	Macfudd1		deluge isn't in it
2009-06-05T15:53:00.000Z	nikola		try refreshing packages
2009-06-05T15:54:00.000Z	Macfudd1	nikola	how?
