2011-07-26T22:54:00.000Z	coz_	th1	 I see... did you check to see if kdirstat is still being developed or maintained?
2011-07-26T22:55:00.000Z	th1	coz_	I don't think it has changed in many years
2011-07-26T22:55:00.000Z	coz_	th1	  from what I see  the last date was 2006
2011-07-26T22:57:00.000Z	coz_	th1	  I believe t he original application was named  sequoiaview  but for windows,, I believe it runs in wine
2011-07-26T22:58:00.000Z	coz_	th1	 I see
2011-07-26T22:58:00.000Z	th1	coz_	but like I said, it was still on the Launchpad page and works
2011-07-26T22:59:00.000Z	coz_	th1	  what about fsview  for konqueror
2011-07-26T22:59:00.000Z	th1	coz_	then I have to install all of the KDE, I haven't tried that but I might do it on the main PC some day
2011-07-26T23:00:00.000Z	coz_	th1	  that was not a real recommendation,, i have hard people having issues with it
2011-07-26T23:02:00.000Z	coz_	th1	 is filelight still available?
2011-07-26T23:03:00.000Z	coz_	th1	 ok that may be at least one alternative although I have not used it.. I have use kdirstat and liked it but have not really found a equal replacemnt
2011-07-26T23:04:00.000Z	th1	coz_	yeah that's why I think it was a shame to delete it when it was useful and didn't have a better replacement
2011-07-26T23:04:00.000Z	coz_	th1	  well talk to the developers about it,,
2011-07-26T23:05:00.000Z	th1	coz_	anyway mission accomplished I now have 4GB free
2011-07-26T23:05:00.000Z	coz_	th1	 ah ok :)
2011-07-26T23:05:00.000Z	th1	coz_	I always use kdirstat when I run out of space
2011-07-26T23:06:00.000Z	coz_	th1	 I thought it was useful myself
