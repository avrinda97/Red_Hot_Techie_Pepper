2010-08-12T16:04:00.000Z	D4CH		How come I have two?
2010-08-12T16:04:00.000Z	D4CH		How do I make it into one?
2010-08-12T16:05:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	D4CH	two.. what?
2010-08-12T16:06:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	D4CH	you have four partitions, not two..
2010-08-12T16:06:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	D4CH	the second one isn't an actual partition, more of a "grouping" one
2010-08-12T16:07:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	D4CH	baggage from DOS days ..
2010-08-12T16:09:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	D4CH	you seem to have two installations .. of ubuntu ?
2010-08-12T16:09:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	D4CH	pastebin: mount
2010-08-12T16:10:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	D4CH	you didn't screw up, you just didn't reuse the partitions left over from the first attempt
2010-08-12T16:10:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	D4CH	paste the output of the 'mount' command
2010-08-12T16:10:00.000Z	D4CH	ilovefairuz	I started using ubuntu yesterday, how do i do it?
2010-08-12T16:11:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	D4CH	type sudo apt-get install pastebinit && mount | pastebinit -
2010-08-12T16:12:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	D4CH	do you synaptic running or updates being downloaded?
2010-08-12T16:16:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	D4CH	install and use gparted to delete the extra partitions but leave /dev/sda6 alone
2010-08-12T16:17:00.000Z	D4CH	ilovefairuz	Which is my OS? >.<
2010-08-12T16:17:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	D4CH	 beware that you won't be able to delete the "extended" partition (the grouping on the right) because ubuntu is located inside of it, so if you still want to, you'll have to reinstall ubuntu and select "erase all disk"
2010-08-12T16:18:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	D4CH	it's the one inside the grouping on the right named 36 gb ext4
2010-08-12T16:19:00.000Z	D4CH	ilovefairuz	Can I add it the now unallocated space to my installation of ubuntu, or will I have to boot a live CD to use gparted and do it?
2010-08-12T16:21:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	D4CH	yes, you'll have to use the live cd
2010-08-12T16:34:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	D4CH	for bootable large iso images, burning at high speeds may cause burn errors
