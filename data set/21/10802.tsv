2005-08-05T07:36:00.000Z	matthew_		how do i customise my ubuntu desktop? anyone?
2005-08-05T07:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	a start is to install gnome-themes-extras from synaptic
2005-08-05T07:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	you'll need the universe repository
2005-08-05T07:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	no, just use the synaptic package manager
2005-08-05T07:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	automagically :)
2005-08-05T07:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	just open up the themes dialogue
2005-08-05T07:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	gnome-look.org is a good place to browse :)
2005-08-05T08:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	just drag it onto the theme dialogue
2007-08-04T08:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	try typing "mail" to see
2007-08-04T08:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	heh - don't worry about it too much : it is probably just something harmless unless you are running a server or something
2007-08-04T08:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	you can make it go away by uninstalling mailx
2007-08-04T08:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	or postfix or both
2007-08-04T08:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	they are messages from root usually - often about cron jobs etc
2007-08-04T08:56:00.000Z	matthew_	thoreauputic	 right... how do you delete the messages and/or tell it to stop telling me that there are messages.
2007-08-04T08:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	you only see them if you have postfix or another mail transport agent installed
2007-08-04T08:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	if you don't understand them, uninstall mailx
2007-08-04T08:57:00.000Z	matthew_	thoreauputic	 I do understand the messages, I just have no reason to see them. I don't need them for anything.  They are useless to me. I don't need to be notified every time a cron job runs.  and I don't know how to delete the messages.
2007-08-04T08:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	I've told you several times - if you don't want them, uninstall mailx and /or postfix
2007-08-04T08:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	or whatever mail agent is generating them ( postfix is most likely)
2007-08-04T08:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	probably not
2007-08-04T08:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	matthew_	it's a mail server basically
