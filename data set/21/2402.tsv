2009-12-20T16:07:00.000Z	wgrant	Psinetic	root has all privileges.
2009-12-20T16:07:00.000Z	wgrant	Psinetic	If you have sudo access, you can do anything.
2009-12-20T16:07:00.000Z	Psinetic	wgrant	well... :( not fair
2009-12-20T16:07:00.000Z	wgrant	Psinetic	It is the superuser. That is the point of it.
2009-12-20T16:08:00.000Z	Psinetic	wgrant	can i make a second sudo password that has different permissions? like, it can install stuff and upgrade do the common stuff but nothing serious?
2009-12-20T16:16:00.000Z	Psinetic	wgrant	that's just retarded. so there's essentially no way at all to lock down your own system? no offense calling it retarded, but it just seems to me like there should be SOMETHING put in place so people can do that
2009-12-20T16:15:00.000Z	wgrant	Psinetic	If you can install software, you can execute code as root.
2009-12-20T16:16:00.000Z	wgrant	Psinetic	You can lock down your system. But if you can install software that can install code that runs as root, you can by extension install code and run it as root.
2009-12-20T16:18:00.000Z	wgrant	Psinetic	You can have a completely locked down account, yes.
2009-12-20T16:18:00.000Z	wgrant	Psinetic	But having a locked down account with the ability to install arbitrary software is contradictorty.
2009-12-20T16:19:00.000Z	Psinetic	wgrant	i'm just looking for parental controls essentially
2009-12-20T16:20:00.000Z	wgrant	Psinetic	... you need to be an administrator on Windows to install most software too.
2009-12-20T16:21:00.000Z	Psinetic	wgrant	is there perhaps a way to make it where the admin account has to first "approve" the software being installed?
2009-12-20T16:22:00.000Z	wgrant	Psinetic	At that point you might as well just not grant your account sufficient privileges to install software.
2009-12-20T16:23:00.000Z	Psinetic	wgrant	well no, i don't think so. i'd still be able to install, but only if the admin account approves it first. so it could go in like a que or something until they approve it
2009-12-20T16:24:00.000Z	wgrant	Psinetic	It's surely much easier to... tell them.
2009-12-20T16:24:00.000Z	Psinetic	wgrant	tell them and have them install it?
2009-12-20T16:24:00.000Z	wgrant	Psinetic	Yes.
2009-12-20T16:24:00.000Z	wgrant	Psinetic	That serves exactly the same function.
2009-12-20T16:25:00.000Z	Psinetic	wgrant	alright. i can do that. need to setup my system first though and all that fun jazz
