2009-04-25T06:19:00.000Z	Huufarted		Anybody here used Ubuntu Netbook on a eee 1000 yet?
2009-04-25T06:20:00.000Z	finn	Huufarted	i'm using it on a toshiba nb100
2009-04-25T06:20:00.000Z	Huufarted	finn	what wifi chipset does that use?
2009-04-25T06:21:00.000Z	finn	Huufarted	ath5k_pci
2009-04-25T06:21:00.000Z	Huufarted	finn	I mean what chipset in the wifi itself? Atheros?  5007?  5008?
2009-04-25T06:21:00.000Z	finn		worked straight away with no configuration, but there is an option for a closed driver as well.  hang on let me find out
2009-04-25T06:22:00.000Z	finn	Huufarted	AR242x 802.11abg Wireless PCI Express Adapter (rev 01)  that's what lspci says, not sure which particular chipset
2009-04-25T06:22:00.000Z	Huufarted	finn	thanks.  :)
2009-04-25T06:23:00.000Z	Huufarted	finn	did the wifi work immediately after install of UNR?
2009-04-25T06:23:00.000Z	finn		yep
2009-04-25T06:23:00.000Z	finn		it even worked in the live session
2009-04-25T06:23:00.000Z	Huufarted	finn	I looked up the AR242x.  That uses the AR5007EG chipset, identical to mine.  :)
2009-04-25T06:24:00.000Z	finn		according to a quick google the nb100 has the Atheros AR5007EG, same as you
2009-04-25T06:24:00.000Z	Huufarted	finn	aye.  :)  Just found that out.  Did it work immediately after you installed UNR or did you have to get the ath5k from the web first?
2009-04-25T06:25:00.000Z	finn	Huufarted	it worked even in the live session before installing to hdd. After installation no action required, it just worked. The only bit of the NB100 that required some manual config was the microphone, but that
2009-04-25T06:25:00.000Z	finn		is toshiba for you
2009-04-25T06:26:00.000Z	Huufarted	finn	that rocks.  Does UNR come installed with netbook-launcher and Maxium already installed and running?
2009-04-25T06:28:00.000Z	finn	Huufarted	not sure about Maxium, but it's got the netbook launcher thing
2009-04-25T06:29:00.000Z	Huufarted	finn	every time you opened a window, did it max out the screen or did it have the standard title bar with the Maximize, Minimize, and Close buttons?
2009-04-25T06:30:00.000Z	Huufarted	finn	I'm wasting your time lol...  I can just as easily boot the .img and find out myself off of the live image.
2009-04-25T06:30:00.000Z	finn	Huufarted	no problem, yeah, it has maxium
