2009-11-26T16:55:00.000Z	gui7		isn't it a bit of a hassle to have to re-install everything when you re-isntall ubuntu? or do you just re-isnatll ubuntu and windows?
2009-11-26T16:56:00.000Z	gui7		when you do a clean install of ubuntu, what exactly do you have to reinstall/mess with?

2009-11-26T17:00:00.000Z	gui7		i'm just afraid the grub in my mbr may be poitning somewhere and then /boot is no longer there
2009-11-26T17:01:00.000Z	indus	gui7	did u create a separate /boot?
2009-11-26T17:01:00.000Z	gui7		not yet
2009-11-26T17:01:00.000Z	gui7	indus	im just looking on what i WILL do
2009-11-26T17:02:00.000Z	gui7		would i have to mess with fstab or any of that?
2009-11-26T17:02:00.000Z	gui7		!fstab
2009-11-26T17:04:00.000Z	gui7		!partitions
2009-11-26T17:04:00.000Z	gui7		so to install grub in a separate partitions i wouldnt need to mess with fstab?
2009-11-26T17:07:00.000Z	gui7		is there an easy way to list all partitions and their properties (ie file system, size, etc) easily?
2009-11-26T17:08:00.000Z	indus		the grub can be installed to a partition too isntead of the mbr
2009-11-26T17:08:00.000Z	gui7		ok good then
