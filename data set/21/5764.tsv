2007-12-05T12:30:00.000Z	Darius08x		Well crap, it's still not working. Gonna ask again one last time. I just recently installed ubuntu desktop 7.10, booted it up, logged in then got scsi 2:0:0:0: rejecting I/O dead device error. I then reboot, and get grub error 17, I then have gone to try and reinstall. But when I get to the "prepare partitions" it doesn't list that I have any.
2007-12-05T12:31:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	hmm, any show in GPartEd?
2007-12-05T12:35:00.000Z	Darius08x	scguy318	It's scanning all devices still..taking a bit
2007-12-05T12:37:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	a minute max, there might be something up with that HDD
2007-12-05T12:37:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	what does sudo fdisk -l say?
2007-12-05T12:42:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	sudo fdisk -l? like the letter L?
2007-12-05T12:52:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	if you need access to your HDD data, I advise plugging it into another machine
2007-12-05T12:52:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	I suspect something hardware wise
2007-12-05T12:53:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	well, I found a bad memory module in a new one that had strange crashes :P
2007-12-05T12:59:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	or a new computer :P
2007-12-05T13:01:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	I'm afraid to say this but your hard drive might have crapped out or something :(
2007-12-05T13:08:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	then that Windows partition is bai bai if you were not aware
2007-12-05T13:09:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	oh, ok!
2007-12-05T13:09:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	that was guided - resize :)
2007-12-05T13:09:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	but anyway
2007-12-05T13:09:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	the partition screen basically says nice and unreadable your HDD?
2007-12-05T13:09:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	probably best shot now is to plug HDD into another machine, see if you can read anything out
2007-12-05T13:10:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	:(
2007-12-05T13:12:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	right now I guess if you can, burn or make a USB bootable for Linux System Rescue CD or Rescubuntu Remix
2007-12-05T13:13:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	might be a shot at data recovery
2007-12-05T13:19:00.000Z	scguy318	Darius08x	wish you luck with your probs, but I must go for the night :( cya
