2008-01-18T18:27:00.000Z	Omegacenti		I am not sure, but I think either my HD, or my controller, of my motherboard crashed.
2008-01-18T18:27:00.000Z	Omegacenti		I have been looking everywhere on google, supoprt forums, anything to figure out what went bad. :(
2008-01-18T18:29:00.000Z	Omegacenti		I am not sure, but I think either my HD, or my controller, of my motherboard crashed. Need some help in troubleshooting to find out what went wrong.

2008-01-18T18:32:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	Omegacenti	What symptoms are you seeing?
2008-01-18T18:36:00.000Z	Omegacenti	ZionPsyfer	I am hearing a low buzz and then a shorter high buzz from the harddrive, last night I created the workaround for hdd unload/load cycles as directed by launchpad seeing that I was getting 80+ loads/unloads on idle per minute on my SMART functions.
2008-01-18T18:37:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	Omegacenti	does SMART report anything odd?
2008-01-18T18:37:00.000Z	Omegacenti	ZionPsyfer	I can't even access S.M.A.R.T because of a bios error code 0200 fixed disk error which I cannot resolve with either google, or forums as to the exact nature of the failiure.
2008-01-18T18:38:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	Omegacenti	Unplugging the hdd resolves the 0200?
2008-01-18T18:39:00.000Z	Omegacenti	ZionPsyfer	Yes it does, and I can boot a live cd after that.
2008-01-18T18:39:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	Omegacenti	Thinkpads in general work great.
2008-01-18T18:40:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	Omegacenti	Alright then it's almost certainly the hdd.  Do you have an alternate that you can try to plug in?
2008-01-18T18:40:00.000Z	Omegacenti	ZionPsyfer	not atm.
2008-01-18T18:40:00.000Z	Omegacenti	ZionPsyfer	this is the second harddrive that has crashed in this laptop :/
2008-01-18T18:42:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	Omegacenti	Ouch!  one thing you can do is when you have ubuntu up and running next, install the 'smartmontools' package.  You can get SMART info from the disk. (sorry if you already knew that)
2008-01-18T18:42:00.000Z	Omegacenti	ZionPsyfer	no problem and I did :) thats how I got my load/unload cycle count increase/hr
2008-01-18T18:43:00.000Z	Omegacenti	ZionPsyfer	the problem now though is that I can't even boot a livecd with the harddrive in, because it doesn't boot all the way.
2008-01-18T18:45:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	Omegacenti	I've had weirdness with bad hard drives causing like 2 minute delays for the POST, or 10 minute boot times from a CD.  A new hdd solved the problem.  I'm not sure if it was IRQ goofiness or just the system attempting ide resets so often that it borked other things... but I'd put money on the drive rather than the controller or mobo  as of right now.
2008-01-18T18:53:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	Omegacenti	sounds good, ikonia has great advice.  A few hours of homework before the purchase can save a ton of headaches and work. =)
2008-01-18T19:01:00.000Z	Omegacenti	ZionPsyfer	blah, went to the compatibility confirmed page on ubuntu website, haven't yet to see a thinkpad :)
2008-01-18T19:02:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	Omegacenti	Hmmm, I've ran it great on my T23, A31 and R61i.  =P  That's only my experience though.
