2011-10-04T23:34:00.000Z	Steve132-2_	jrib	Sorry, got disconnected
2011-10-04T23:35:00.000Z	Steve132-2_	jrib	libatlas3gf-base
2011-10-04T23:35:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	and what do you believe it should conflict with?
2011-10-04T23:37:00.000Z	Steve132-2_	jrib	according to the list on synaptic: "conflicts libblas3gf <1.2-5"
2011-10-04T23:38:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	and what version of libblas3gf have you installed?
2011-10-04T23:38:00.000Z	Steve132-2_	jrib	fair enough, I have libblas 1.2-8
2011-10-04T23:39:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	state what you want :)
2011-10-04T23:39:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	what happens when you attempt to remove libblas3gf?
2011-10-04T23:41:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	it doesn't seem to be removing atlas, just the -dev packages for it
2011-10-04T23:41:00.000Z	Steve132-2_	jrib	I noticed that, but don't I want the -dev packages for it?
2011-10-04T23:41:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	do you?
2011-10-04T23:41:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	for what?
2011-10-04T23:42:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	if you're programming using libatlas in C then yes you want them
2011-10-04T23:43:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	see the dependencies for libatlas-dev
2011-10-04T23:44:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	anyway I imagine your real question since it seems you have a need for these headers is how to configure what libraries octave uses
2011-10-04T23:44:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	probably
2011-10-04T23:45:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	you should check for documentation in /usr/share/doc/octave to see if there is anything relevant there
2011-10-04T23:47:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	are you sure octave doesn't choose atlas even if both are installed?
2011-10-04T23:47:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	how?
2011-10-04T23:54:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	have you read /usr/share/doc/octave3.2/README.Atlas.gz ?
2011-10-04T23:56:00.000Z	jrib	Steve132-2_	so you should be able to reinstall the blas package you removed if you need the headers and just use the alternatives system to make sure octave uses atlas
