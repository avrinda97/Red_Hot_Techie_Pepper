2009-05-13T10:11:00.000Z	nickolaus		I upgraded my laptop and I'm getting " kernel panic - not syncing : VFS: unable to mount root FS on unknown-block" when it boots. Any ideas?
2009-05-13T10:12:00.000Z	vertix	nickolaus	EXACTLY the same error i get on 8.10

2009-05-13T10:13:00.000Z	nickolaus	vertix	i got it upgrading to 8.10
2009-05-13T10:14:00.000Z	vertix	nickolaus	looks like there is a bug in this version (8.10)

2009-05-13T10:14:00.000Z	nickolaus	vertix	is there a fix? i need to get it up and running asap.
2009-05-13T10:14:00.000Z	vertix		[0.700244] Please append correct "root=" option; here are available partitions:
2009-05-13T10:14:00.000Z	vertix		[0.700329 Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount fs on unknown-block (8,1)
2009-05-13T10:15:00.000Z	vertix	nickolaus	can you read my errors and see if this is what YOU get?
2009-05-13T10:15:00.000Z	nickolaus	vertix	kernel panic - not syncing : VFS: unable to mount root FS on unknown-block (0,0) not 8,1
2009-05-13T10:15:00.000Z	vertix	nickolaus	i've been screwing with this thing for a week without sleep
2009-05-13T10:16:00.000Z	vertix	nickolaus	that's ok. i got that one also, block number does not matter, it comes in several flavors depending on how you are trying to but it
2009-05-13T10:17:00.000Z	vertix	nickolaus	what drive are you using? did you say you are trying to put it on laptop?
2009-05-13T10:18:00.000Z	vertix	nickolaus	do you know the sata controller chipset brand and manufacturer?
2009-05-13T10:18:00.000Z	nickolaus	vertix	yeah. I was told it was because the kernal was never upgraded because it failed to complete the upgrade.
2009-05-13T10:19:00.000Z	vertix	nickolaus	i don't get what you mean about kernel upgrade
2009-05-13T10:20:00.000Z	vertix	nickolaus	who told you this and can you tell me exactly what they told you?
2009-05-13T10:21:00.000Z	vertix	nickolaus	the problem with kernel is that it boots off of liveCD, so there is something really funky with 8.10. it does not look that straightforward
2009-05-13T10:23:00.000Z	vertix		anybody knows if i can upgrade to 9.04 off of 8.10 live CD? cause i can't fry from ISO
2009-05-13T10:24:00.000Z	vertix	nickolaus	do you have a sata drive?
