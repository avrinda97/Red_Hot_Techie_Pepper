2005-11-20T12:52:00.000Z	Delvien	trappist	its telling me '$HOME' must exist and belong to you in order for the installation to proceed you may need to log in as root or use su rather than use sudo.. I tried all three methods none work

2005-11-20T12:53:00.000Z	trappist	Delvien	yes

2005-11-25T13:16:00.000Z	Delvien	trappist	CrossOver is slow, and unreliable
2005-11-25T13:16:00.000Z	trappist	Delvien	it's neither in my experience, but I'm pretty sure it's the only solution for what you're trying to do, unless you want some virtualization like vmware or something
2005-11-25T13:18:00.000Z	trappist	Delvien	I'm not a photoshop guy but I run apps in cxoffice all the time, and I find that it works quite nicely.  especially newer versions.
2005-11-25T13:18:00.000Z	Delvien	trappist	i have 4.1 , doesnt work too good lol.. but it is the demo...
2005-11-25T13:18:00.000Z	trappist	Delvien	the demo is fully functional, so that wouldn't be it.  5.0 is available, though.
