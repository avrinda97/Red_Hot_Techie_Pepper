2009-08-05T20:49:00.000Z	Shoe		I think the package installer for limewire is fired. It's been stuck on preparing-sun-java6-jre
2009-08-05T20:50:00.000Z	wizz	Shoe	you haven't java yet?
2009-08-05T20:51:00.000Z	Shoe	wizz	I don't know
2009-08-05T20:52:00.000Z	Shoe	wizz	what do I search for in Add/Remove?
2009-08-05T20:54:00.000Z	wizz	Shoe	install it again, when it's installing java, you must be roll down 'TERMINAL' and follow thats instruction
2009-08-05T20:54:00.000Z	Shoe	wizz	what?
2009-08-05T20:55:00.000Z	wizz	Shoe	Please do what i say.
2009-08-05T20:55:00.000Z	Shoe	wizz	I don't know what you mean by rolling down terminal. Just open the terminal while it's installing and it'll tell me what to do?
2009-08-05T20:58:00.000Z	wizz	Shoe	no when you install limewire, you can look on bottom of windows of install the word 'TERMINAL' with lil triangle beside it
2009-08-05T21:00:00.000Z	Shoe	wizz	I'm at the package installer and the only options are install and details
2009-08-05T21:01:00.000Z	wizz		install first
2009-08-05T21:01:00.000Z	wizz	Shoe	install first
2009-08-05T21:01:00.000Z	Shoe	wizz	now what?
2009-08-05T21:02:00.000Z	wizz	Shoe	when it stuck, roll down the lil triangle at the bottom installtion window
2009-08-05T21:02:00.000Z	Shoe	wizz	the other package installer froze and won't close, so I can't use this one right now. How do I close the other package installer?
2009-08-05T21:03:00.000Z	wizz	Shoe	i don't know
2009-08-05T21:04:00.000Z	Shoe		does anyone know what to type into a terminal to close an unresponsive program?
2009-08-05T21:05:00.000Z	wizz	Shoe	if it happen to me i will restart my system (close any windows first, and press ctrl+alt+backspace)
