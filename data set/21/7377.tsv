2006-10-27T11:17:00.000Z	harisund		Does anybody know if I can do a file transfer that involves root permission in one step?
2006-10-27T11:17:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	harisund	sudo cp ?
2006-10-27T11:18:00.000Z	harisund	ianmacgregor	aaaah .. no. I have /etc/proftpd.conf on my Fedora box, which I want to move to /etc/proftpd.conf on my Ubuntu box. Can I do it in one step?
2006-10-27T11:18:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	harisund	Are you able to mount the fedora partition in your Ubuntu?
2006-10-27T11:19:00.000Z	harisund	ianmacgregor	eh? no . I can't. They are on two seperate networks not easily accessible except through ssh.
2006-10-27T11:19:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	harisund	You can do it via ssh with scp
2006-10-27T11:19:00.000Z	harisund	ianmacgregor	then I would need two steps..
2006-10-27T11:20:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	harisund	If you are at the Ubuntu box: scp user@host:/path/to/file /path/to/target (where target is a /path/file on the Ubuntu box)
2006-10-27T11:20:00.000Z	harisund	ianmacgregor	yeah but what is the /path/to/target on the Ubuntu box is in /etc ???
2006-10-27T11:20:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	harisund	scp = secure copy, you only need on step if using scp
2006-10-27T11:21:00.000Z	harisund	ianmacgregor	no. I will have to first copy as a regular user into somewhere in my home directory then use sudo cp to move it into my /etc.
2006-10-27T11:21:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	harisund	You can "target" anywhere and then just cp to the proper dir, or you can scp blah blah /etc
2006-10-27T11:21:00.000Z	harisund	ianmacgregor	ok never mind. I will just enable my root account. Sorry for troubling you :)
2006-10-27T11:22:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	harisund	It's not a good idea to enable the root account.. this can be done without the root account being enabled.
2006-10-27T11:22:00.000Z	harisund	ianmacgregor	why is it not a good idea to enable root account?
2006-10-27T11:24:00.000Z	harisund	ianmacgregor	yeah yeah I know the routine. just that I am a long time Linux user, and like to do things the traditional way. Now if enabling root account breaks Ubuntu in anyway that's a pain. But if you are only mentioning so for security reasons and such, I am fine, no problem.
2006-10-27T11:25:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	harisund	Yeah, I was mentioning it for security reasons and also because enabling the root account is not supported :)
2006-10-27T11:25:00.000Z	harisund	ianmacgregor	supported by what? You mean if I have the Canonical official support and I enable root account canonical won't support?
2006-10-27T11:25:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	harisund	If you're a long time Linux user, you should be able to do it without the root account ;)
2006-10-27T11:26:00.000Z	harisund	ianmacgregor	yes, there are plenty of ways it can be done without root. I could do --> sudo sh -c "scp remote:file local:file" for starters
2006-10-27T11:27:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	harisund	Yes, and then sudo cp or sudo mv
