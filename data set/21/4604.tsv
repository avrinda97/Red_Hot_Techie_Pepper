2008-07-04T13:50:00.000Z	usr13		Where do we find recent updates?
2008-07-04T13:51:00.000Z	usr13		What packages were recently updated?
2008-07-04T13:52:00.000Z	DistroJockey	usr13	I use the  File - History  menu in Synaptic
2008-07-04T13:55:00.000Z	DistroJockey	usr13	log.1 is the log before the last .log
2008-07-04T13:56:00.000Z	usr13	DistroJockey	But  2008-06-01 07:35 /var/log/dpkg.log is empty
2008-07-04T13:57:00.000Z	DistroJockey	usr13	not sure on when the logs get started. May be at boot ?
2008-07-04T13:57:00.000Z	usr13	DistroJockey	I just did  apt-get update   but did not update anything.
2008-07-04T13:58:00.000Z	DistroJockey	usr13	sudo apt-get update  = update's the current lists,  sudo apt-get upgrade  (after an update) get's new stuff
2008-07-04T14:00:00.000Z	usr13	DistroJockey	But   sudo apt-get upgrade   will do a distributon upgrade.  Right?
2008-07-04T14:00:00.000Z	usr13	DistroJockey	Not sure if I want to do that yet.
2008-07-04T14:00:00.000Z	DistroJockey	usr13	nope, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade does that
2008-07-04T14:00:00.000Z	usr13	DistroJockey	Oh. Ok.
2008-07-04T14:14:00.000Z	DistroJockey	usr13	ohh :(
2008-07-04T14:09:00.000Z	DistroJockey	usr13	I'd wait a bit before upgrading and try again later
2008-07-04T14:13:00.000Z	DistroJockey	usr13	if you after a way for it to do auto updates at a certain frequency, you can look in  System - Administration - Software Sources  in the  Updates tab
2008-07-04T14:13:00.000Z	usr13	DistroJockey	Are you talking about dist-upgrade? or.... just package upgrades?
2008-07-04T14:13:00.000Z	DistroJockey	usr13	just package
2008-07-04T14:14:00.000Z	usr13	DistroJockey	I'm doing this via ssh.
2008-07-04T14:18:00.000Z	DistroJockey	usr13	well, I got openoffice and kernel updates just over 2 hours ago, but the kernel was the same and no reboot was suggested
2008-07-04T14:18:00.000Z	usr13	DistroJockey	Very good. Tnx
2008-07-04T14:19:00.000Z	DistroJockey	usr13	no problem, you're welcome
