2010-07-05T15:06:00.000Z	abhi_nav		wubi? what is wubi to do with grub restoration?
2010-07-05T15:06:00.000Z	NeverCast	abhi_nav	That is something I have always wondered, Does wubi just use the Windows boot loader? or install the GRUB loader?
2010-07-05T15:07:00.000Z	abhi_nav	NeverCast	how wubi can use grub? its INSIDE windwos naa? I mean its like an normal aps to win? how can it edit mbr?
2010-07-05T15:07:00.000Z	NeverCast	abhi_nav	Well the kernel images are in the windows partition sure.
2010-07-05T15:08:00.000Z	NeverCast	abhi_nav	But it isn't like a Virtual Machine, the kernel is actually loaded
2010-07-05T15:08:00.000Z	NeverCast	abhi_nav	I would believe Wubi would use GRUB bootloader
2010-07-05T15:11:00.000Z	NeverCast	abhi_nav	that's okay it was just chit-chat.
2010-07-05T15:17:00.000Z	NeverCast	abhi_nav	I'm not sure if he used wubi
2010-07-05T15:17:00.000Z	NeverCast	abhi_nav	regardless, Wubi still uses the GRUB loader
2010-07-05T15:18:00.000Z	abhi_nav	NeverCast	yah that is what I try to clear
2010-07-05T15:18:00.000Z	abhi_nav	NeverCast	yes but id dont messes with mbr?
2010-07-05T15:19:00.000Z	NeverCast	abhi_nav	What do you mean doesn't mess with the MBR, GRUB is written to the MBR.
2010-07-05T15:20:00.000Z	abhi_nav	NeverCast	I am totally confused. I never used wubi. but tell me that if one installed ubuntu inside windows i.e. wubi right? so it install under windows like any other ap? then how it can manipulate real mbr?
2010-07-05T15:21:00.000Z	NeverCast	abhi_nav	It doesn't install inside windows, It just convinces the average windows user that it has, so they can remove an entire oper' from Add/Remove.
2010-07-05T15:22:00.000Z	abhi_nav	NeverCast	ok. Still not understood. but is ok. leave it. lets see if we can help him.
2010-07-05T15:25:00.000Z	NeverCast	abhi_nav	IF he can get back lol.
2010-07-05T15:25:00.000Z	abhi_nav	NeverCast	:D lol really. yes it is here really a problem of broadband connection. I am also just lost you see? like that
2010-07-05T15:26:00.000Z	NeverCast	abhi_nav	Nope it's not an application
2010-07-05T15:27:00.000Z	abhi_nav	NeverCast	Dr_Willis ok. thanks.
2010-07-05T15:27:00.000Z	NeverCast	abhi_nav	It just has an Application for adding and removing the distro (:
