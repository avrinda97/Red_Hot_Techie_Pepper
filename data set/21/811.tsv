2011-06-01T06:55:00.000Z	bkfitz		You using unity or 'classic'?
2011-06-01T06:55:00.000Z	bkfitz		if you are using 'classic' have you tried any screenlets
2011-06-01T06:55:00.000Z	bkfitz		or can you try one for me... i think i've discovered a bug - see if you can add 'clearcalendar'
2011-06-01T06:56:00.000Z	bkfitz		nothing bad happens, it just wont add to the desktop
2011-06-01T06:56:00.000Z	bkfitz		other screenlets will add fine, that one won't
2011-06-01T06:57:00.000Z	bkfitz		no prob thx
2011-06-01T06:58:00.000Z	bkfitz		Anyone else think Ubuntu may have 'jumped the shark' with this change to Unity?>
2011-06-01T06:58:00.000Z	bkfitz		No prob.
2011-06-01T07:00:00.000Z	Gorlak	bkfitz	nope doesnt work for me either
2011-06-01T07:00:00.000Z	Gorlak	bkfitz	other widgets work but not that one
2011-06-01T07:00:00.000Z	bkfitz	Gorlak	thx... now I just have to figure out how to submit a bug
2011-06-01T07:00:00.000Z	bkfitz	Gorlak	what a pain... I loved that screenlet :)
2011-06-01T07:00:00.000Z	Gorlak	bkfitz	i think you have to have a launchpad account to start with
2011-06-01T07:00:00.000Z	Gorlak		yea,
2011-06-01T07:01:00.000Z	bkfitz	Gorlak	ugh... anyone want to submit it for me :)

2011-06-01T07:01:00.000Z	Gorlak	bkfitz	you sure there isnt already a bug report submited, it seems like a pretty obvious bug
2011-06-01T07:02:00.000Z	bkfitz	Gorlak	done a bit of googling and havent found anything, but....
2011-06-01T07:02:00.000Z	Gorlak	bkfitz	i know how that goes
2011-06-01T07:02:00.000Z	bkfitz	Gorlak	thx for checking... Anyone else here have the ability to submit bugs?
