2008-03-14T01:09:00.000Z	testic		I am back again, with the same CD eject problem; Ubuntu simply will not eject the CD, I have just rebooted and removed the CD that was in, now I want to insert another, but cannot. any idea?
2008-03-14T01:10:00.000Z	Alan_M	testic	does your cd drive have a "pinhole" type thing on the cd tray?
2008-03-14T01:11:00.000Z	testic	Alan_M	yes it does, but I hope you are not about to suggest that I use that every time I wish to use a CD
2008-03-14T01:11:00.000Z	Alan_M		Testic, only temporarily :)
2008-03-14T01:11:00.000Z	testic	Alan_M	what would you suggest I do in the future?
2008-03-14T01:12:00.000Z	Alan_M	testic	I would say order a new drive, sounds like the motors burned out....but..im just saying this from what I've seen in comments...im not sure I have been here for your whole conversation.
2008-03-14T01:13:00.000Z	Alan_M		Does the drive make any noise when you press eject testic?
2008-03-14T01:13:00.000Z	testic	Alan_M	I am very sure the drive works, I was using it earlier in Windows, and when I rebooted I was able to eject it during the BIOS screen
2008-03-14T01:13:00.000Z	testic	Alan_M	no noises, no error messages displayed
2008-03-14T01:13:00.000Z	Alan_M		Oh, well...hmmmm
2008-03-14T01:13:00.000Z	Alan_M	testic	im scratching my head on this one buddy, im at a loss here :(
2008-03-14T01:14:00.000Z	testic	Alan_M	me too, the drive worked just fine last time I booted into Ubuntu
2008-03-14T01:15:00.000Z	Alan_M		Did you change any settins since the last time testic?
2008-03-14T01:15:00.000Z	testic	Alan_M	nothing at all
2008-03-14T01:15:00.000Z	Alan_M		wow...um.
2008-03-14T01:16:00.000Z	Alan_M		some setting somewhere got messed up somehow, but...what...heh, im trying to think of everything and I cant..
2008-03-14T01:16:00.000Z	Alan_M		!iso | Devourer
2008-03-14T01:17:00.000Z	Alan_M		oops, wrong one..that was for mounting not making my bad :(
2008-03-14T01:22:00.000Z	Alan_M		thanks ompaul, I was at a loss for commands there for a sec.
2008-03-14T01:22:00.000Z	Alan_M		heh
2008-03-14T01:32:00.000Z	testic	Alan_M	"sudo hdparm -w /dev/hdb"  has enabled me to open my CD drive, but being a noob I dont know what I have done :)
