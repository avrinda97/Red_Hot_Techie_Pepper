2006-04-02T13:09:00.000Z	_jason	curley_sue	paste the first lines of /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname please
2006-04-02T13:11:00.000Z	curley_sue	_jason	no need for paste in my case:
2006-04-02T13:11:00.000Z	curley_sue	_jason	~$ more /etc/hosts
2006-04-02T13:11:00.000Z	_jason	curley_sue	and what is in /etc/hostname?
2006-04-02T13:11:00.000Z	curley_sue	_jason	EA (my comp-name)
2006-04-02T13:12:00.000Z	curley_sue	_jason	I deleted so lines using Network-admin. I guess played too much with it
2006-04-02T13:12:00.000Z	_jason	curley_sue	ok you will need to either su to root if you have access to root or boot in recovery mode and insert this line at the beginning of /etc/hosts: 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost EA
2006-04-02T13:12:00.000Z	_jason	curley_sue	do you know how to edit files in cli?
2006-04-02T13:13:00.000Z	curley_sue	_jason	ok I already rebooted as root, I'll try that. don't know cli. I use vim.
2006-04-02T13:13:00.000Z	_jason	curley_sue	heh that's what I mean, cli is just command line interface :)
2006-04-02T13:15:00.000Z	curley_sue	_jason	well, newbie (7 months and still - newbie ;-)
2006-04-02T13:16:00.000Z	curley_sue	_jason	got my sudo bak :)!
2006-04-02T13:16:00.000Z	_jason	curley_sue	great
2006-04-02T13:19:00.000Z	_jason	curley_sue	probably some ipv6 stuff?  to tell you the truth I don't know what it does, but I have it in mine if you want me to pastebin it...
2006-04-02T13:20:00.000Z	curley_sue	_jason	any idea which prog creates it? which should be there?
2006-04-02T13:20:00.000Z	_jason	curley_sue	I have one line taht reads # (added automatically by netbase upgrade), so maybe a dpkg-reconfigure of netbase will do it, but I am speculating
2006-04-02T13:24:00.000Z	curley_sue	_jason	u did it again! 'dpkg-reconfigure netbase' (root-priv) and there back! thanx again!
2006-04-02T13:35:00.000Z	_jason	curley_sue	I looked at it but I don't really know why your light wouldn't turn off.  Does it turn off after a few minutes?  maybe it is finishing writing something
2006-04-02T13:37:00.000Z	curley_sue	_jason	it's this way for longer than ten min. It is not supposed to be writing anything
2006-04-02T13:40:00.000Z	curley_sue	_jason	lullabud got to go. thanx for all the help!
