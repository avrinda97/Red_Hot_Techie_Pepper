2009-10-08T07:45:00.000Z	mralexandro	pornstar	i am looking into it. i made him install system updates, and to go into hardware drivers afterwards
2009-10-08T07:48:00.000Z	pornstar	mralexandro	mhh have u tried to configure the connection manually?
2009-10-08T07:49:00.000Z	mralexandro	pornstar	nope, i am not there

2009-10-08T07:50:00.000Z	mralexandro	pornstar	lots of people with the same problem in ubuntu forums, looking for solutions there now
2009-10-08T07:53:00.000Z	pornstar	mralexandro	what happens when u plug the modem directly to ethernet
2009-10-08T07:54:00.000Z	mralexandro	pornstar	he is on internet with lan, if that is what you ment
2009-10-08T07:54:00.000Z	pornstar	mralexandro	mhh weird.. ive had that problem before but for me its just kind of a glitch
2009-10-08T07:55:00.000Z	mralexandro	pornstar	what do you mean with a glitch?
2009-10-08T07:56:00.000Z	pornstar	mralexandro	it doesnt displays correctly on the screen but after a few attempts it works
2009-10-08T07:57:00.000Z	pornstar	mralexandro	i suppose you've tried to turn wifi on and off with your laptop switch, reseting the modem etc..
2009-10-08T07:57:00.000Z	mralexandro	pornstar	at least he say hi did, but i guess he should try some more
2009-10-08T07:58:00.000Z	mralexandro	pornstar	think i will ask him to get in here via xchat
2009-10-08T08:00:00.000Z	pornstar	mralexandro	ok
