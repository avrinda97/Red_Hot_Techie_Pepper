2007-05-03T14:42:00.000Z	ussjoin	Kazol	The network manager in Feisty rocks-- I highly recommend it.
2007-05-03T14:42:00.000Z	ussjoin	Kazol	And in general my experience with wifi under Feisty (I use ipw3945) has been more positive than ever before.
2007-05-03T14:43:00.000Z	ussjoin	Kazol	The new netmanager should be better than that, even.
2007-05-03T14:43:00.000Z	Kazol	ussjoin	I had to use "NetworkManager Applet 0.6.2" instead of ndiswrapper to get my Belkin wifi to work.
2007-05-03T14:43:00.000Z	ussjoin	Kazol	I understand. Ndiswrapper is only a stopgap-- and not using it is therefore good as it makes your upgrade easier, not harder.
2007-05-03T14:44:00.000Z	Kazol	ussjoin	I'll try installing Edgy, then Feisty later today. I'm looking forward for it. I hope my wifi works!
2007-05-03T14:44:00.000Z	ussjoin	Kazol	You're on dapper now?
2007-05-03T14:46:00.000Z	Kazol	ussjoin	yes
2007-05-03T14:47:00.000Z	ussjoin	Kazol	I tend to (and this will give people in here heart attacks, but) upgrade fully at once.
2007-05-03T14:47:00.000Z	ussjoin	Kazol	I just find that gives me a smaller set of broken things to fix.
2007-05-03T14:48:00.000Z	Kazol	ussjoin	what do you mean? Reformat and install?
2007-05-03T14:48:00.000Z	ussjoin	Kazol	That said, I do that on my laptop, and my data's svned so if I have to work somewhere else for a day, that's OK.
2007-05-03T14:48:00.000Z	ussjoin	Kazol	I like that too :-) but linux people hate that. What I meant was go straight from Dapper to Feisty, or whatnot.
2007-05-03T14:48:00.000Z	Kazol	ussjoin	That is possible?
2007-05-03T14:49:00.000Z	Kazol	ussjoin	This is how I configured my wifi card: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185174 Will it work the same under Feisty?
2007-05-03T14:49:00.000Z	ussjoin	Kazol	Actually the skip upgrade's unsupported, looking at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/UpgradeFromOldVersion
2007-05-03T14:50:00.000Z	Kazol	ussjoin	I don't really mind installing Edgy as an intermediate step. But I am concerned whether this procedure: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185174 Will work in Feisty.
2007-05-03T14:52:00.000Z	ussjoin	Kazol	That page is pretty out of date. Ubuntu in 7.04 got a *lot* of companies to authorize firmware distribution-- so it's likely that it'll actually "just work."
2007-05-03T14:52:00.000Z	ussjoin	Kazol	That said, if you could plug in *during* the upgrade (as it might break in Edgy, then work again in Feisty) that might be useful.
2007-05-03T14:53:00.000Z	Kazol	ussjoin	cool, I'll do it. If for some reason something gets screwed up, could I revert back to Dapper?
2007-05-03T14:54:00.000Z	ussjoin	Kazol	No-- not really.
