2011-06-06T17:59:00.000Z	qtoran	revorad	we re a lil off topic here so before we get shout at i can just say if you re happy with dell stick with them, they re the best imo
2011-06-06T17:59:00.000Z	revorad	qtoran	why off topic? im need to run ubuntu on it
2011-06-06T18:00:00.000Z	qtoran	revorad	i am going off topic because im suggesting you brands without you asking :P by the way dell is usually pretty linux friendly, most models let you choose if you want intel card or ati / nvidia hybrid
