2009-08-18T23:39:00.000Z	haf1ztang		how do i learn about linux?
2009-08-18T23:40:00.000Z	MsMaco	haf1ztang	with a mouse?
2009-08-18T23:43:00.000Z	MsMaco	haf1ztang	you want to learn how to use the linux desktop?
2009-08-18T23:44:00.000Z	haf1ztang	MsMaco	not just linux desktop. i want to learn about linux..the system..
2009-08-18T23:44:00.000Z	MsMaco	haf1ztang	well if you want to get technical, linux is only the kernel...a collection of drivers, a scheduler, and bit to allocate memory
2009-08-18T23:45:00.000Z	MsMaco	haf1ztang	so youre gonna need to be more specific.  im guessing you dont mean to memorize every line of the kernel and work on the drivers just yet
2009-08-18T23:47:00.000Z	MsMaco	haf1ztang	i suggest starting out with learning your way around the desktop and learning the basic commands needed to admin a desktop system. once youve got that down, if you want to learn system administration, youll have the necessary base knowledge
2009-08-18T23:47:00.000Z	MsMaco	haf1ztang	start with the Official Ubuntu Book or the Ubuntu Pocket Guide (the latter is a free pdf)
2009-08-18T23:48:00.000Z	haf1ztang	MsMaco	is that possible for me learn unix in linux?
2009-08-18T23:48:00.000Z	MsMaco	haf1ztang	when its time to learn system administration stuff, the Linux Professionals Institute Certification study books are good for teaching you more obscure commands and the differences between different distros like Red Hat and Debian or Ubuntu
2009-08-18T23:48:00.000Z	MsMaco	haf1ztang	many of the commands are the same, but some file will be in different places
2009-08-18T23:50:00.000Z	MsMaco	haf1ztang	for example, i work on openafs. on solaris, kerberos goes in /etc/csw/bin/ but on suse its in /usr/lib/mit/bin/ and on red hat /usr/kerberos/bin/
2009-08-18T23:50:00.000Z	MsMaco	haf1ztang	er /opt/cws/bin/ for solaris, sorry
2009-08-18T23:51:00.000Z	haf1ztang	MsMaco	how come u can master is that ?
2009-08-18T23:51:00.000Z	haf1ztang	MsMaco	how come u can master in that ?
2009-08-18T23:51:00.000Z	haf1ztang	MsMaco	u must be spending much time
2009-08-18T23:51:00.000Z	MsMaco	haf1ztang	openafs is my day-job
2009-08-18T23:52:00.000Z	MsMaco	haf1ztang	so i have to learn these unix systems for work. today im working on aix.
2009-08-18T23:52:00.000Z	haf1ztang	MsMaco	proud of u
2009-08-18T23:53:00.000Z	haf1ztang	MsMaco	hw do you start anyway?
