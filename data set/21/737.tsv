2011-07-28T07:09:00.000Z	Darksmurf		I'm trying to create an 11.04 LiveUSB with persistance and I'm having some problems. I seem to remember a tool that used to be included in Ubuntu that would do exactly this, but I can't find it. I've tried using the Startup Disk Creator, but that just creates an Install USB disk. Google results seem to indicate this tool is the correct tool, and one tutorial specificly states that this tool can be used to create a bootable s
2011-07-28T07:09:00.000Z	Darksmurf		tick that can run AND install.. but I see no 'run' or 'live' option on the grub menu.
2011-07-28T07:10:00.000Z	Darksmurf		I'm using an 11.04 install ISO as my source. Any suggestiongs?
2011-07-28T07:10:00.000Z	Darksmurf		suggestions*
2011-07-28T07:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	Darksmurf	rather then Live+persistance, have you considered just installing onto the USB?
2011-07-28T07:13:00.000Z	Darksmurf	zykotick9	that would actually be prefered, and I would love to do that with a plain Debian install,  but the system I'm using this on has no optical drive, and I don't have any other USB sticks large enough to create a second install stick.
2011-07-28T07:16:00.000Z	zykotick9	Darksmurf	YES, with Ubuntu it will try to install Grub to the HD instead of the USB - you need to select "advanced" and change that.
2011-07-28T07:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	Darksmurf	yes

2011-07-29T08:07:00.000Z	Darksmurf	zykotick9	oops, k :-)
2011-07-29T09:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	Darksmurf	"mv /etc/init/gdm /etc/init/gdm.disabled" but tab complete to verify filename
2011-07-29T09:49:00.000Z	Darksmurf	zykotick9	sudo mv /etc/init.d/gdm /etc/init.d/gdm.disabled then sudo reboot still results in X starting.
2011-07-29T09:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	Darksmurf	/etc/init no init.d!
2011-07-29T09:50:00.000Z	Darksmurf	zykotick9	so rename gdm.conf ?
2011-07-29T09:51:00.000Z	zykotick9	Darksmurf	yup
2011-07-29T09:56:00.000Z	Darksmurf	zykotick9	that seems to have stopped X. I thought the boot hung because all I got was a black screen. I CTRL+ALT+DEL and now it is shutting down. I think I was on vterm 7, where the X display should have been.
2011-07-29T09:57:00.000Z	zykotick9	Darksmurf	that's been a bug for a while...
2011-07-29T09:57:00.000Z	Darksmurf	zykotick9	as it it defaults to black screen or it defaults to vt7?
2011-07-29T09:57:00.000Z	zykotick9	Darksmurf	the server folks where complaining about it in 10.04
2011-07-29T09:57:00.000Z	zykotick9	Darksmurf	vt7
2011-07-29T09:58:00.000Z	zykotick9	Darksmurf	glad to help
