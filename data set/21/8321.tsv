2007-01-26T10:25:00.000Z	sidolin		hey
2007-01-26T10:26:00.000Z	sidolin		is there already a qt4.2 and pyqt 4.2 package for ubuntu?
2007-01-26T10:26:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	take a look
2007-01-26T10:26:00.000Z	sidolin	mooky	in feisty is only 4.1
2007-01-26T10:26:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	so probably not
2007-01-26T10:29:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	build yourself a package
2007-01-26T10:29:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	why do you need that version ?
2007-01-26T10:29:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	what platform are they developing on
2007-01-26T10:30:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	well, seems silly to be developing on bleeding edge
2007-01-26T10:30:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	they will have to build a qt4.2 ubuntu/debian package
2007-01-26T10:31:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	thats part of consideration, support/usablility for people
2007-01-26T10:31:00.000Z	sidolin	mooky	or link static
2007-01-26T10:31:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	they should build a package for every distro they want support/compatability
2007-01-26T10:31:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	personal preference - link
2007-01-26T10:31:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	so why bother with ubuntu ?
2007-01-26T10:32:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	well, either build a package - or don't use it
2007-01-26T10:33:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	its not stable on read or write
2007-01-26T10:34:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	its better to accept cross-support file systems don't really work at the moment - use as a bare minimum
2007-01-26T10:34:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	thats the correct answer
2007-01-26T10:36:00.000Z	sidolin	mooky	you can install gentoo from ubuntu
2007-01-26T10:37:00.000Z	mooky	sidolin	yes, that is true using it as "host" sdistro for stage one
