2010-10-24T16:44:00.000Z	johnswr	YoungGUN	Insert USB fuzzstick. Launch the Startup Disk Creator. Format the fuzzstick if necessary. Set the install to the USB that shows the size. Point to the .iso file.
2010-10-24T16:44:00.000Z	YoungGUN	johnswr	ive done all that
2010-10-24T16:44:00.000Z	YoungGUN		but the problem im having is when i go to boot off the stick
2010-10-24T16:45:00.000Z	YoungGUN		it brings up a black screen with system linux blah blah bios copyright 97-2009
2010-10-24T16:45:00.000Z	johnswr	YoungGUN	 Haven't created a USB boot from 10.10. I'll have to give it a try.
2010-10-24T16:46:00.000Z	YoungGUN		yeah 9.10 worked fine no problems :X
2010-10-24T16:46:00.000Z	YoungGUN		but 10.10 doesnt seem to boot off stick
2010-10-24T16:46:00.000Z	YoungGUN		so im not sure if im missing something
2010-10-24T16:46:00.000Z	johnswr	YoungGUN	You could boot to the Live CD and create it from there, I believe
2010-10-24T16:46:00.000Z	YoungGUN		john i dont have any cd's :X
2010-10-24T16:47:00.000Z	johnswr	YoungGUN	Where's the .iso? Use Brasero to burn the .iso to a cd. No worries
