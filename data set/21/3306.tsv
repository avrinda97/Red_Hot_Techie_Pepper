2009-11-04T16:16:00.000Z	jrib	WishingMaster	login at tty1, create a new user, determine if you can login with the new user using gdm
2009-11-04T16:18:00.000Z	WishingMaster	jrib	there is no option for selecting GNOME or KDE , only tty1 is where i can login
2009-11-04T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	WishingMaster	ok, did you do what I said?
2009-11-04T16:20:00.000Z	WishingMaster	jrib	the screen that appears after ubuntu logo is a console screen
2009-11-04T16:20:00.000Z	jrib	WishingMaster	so you do not see gdm at all?
2009-11-04T16:20:00.000Z	WishingMaster	jrib	nope
2009-11-04T16:20:00.000Z	jrib	WishingMaster	check /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2009-11-04T16:21:00.000Z	WishingMaster	jrib	what is command to open a file in console?
2009-11-04T16:21:00.000Z	jrib	WishingMaster	you can use "less"
2009-11-04T16:22:00.000Z	WishingMaster	jrib	less xorg.o.log is that correct?
2009-11-04T16:22:00.000Z	jrib	WishingMaster	your link just tells me about someone buying a card on ebay.  Later in that thread though, someone says the STA driver is working.  Does the STA driver available in System -> Administration -> Software Sources not work for you?
2009-11-04T16:23:00.000Z	jrib	WishingMaster	no, give the whole path with the correct capitalization
2009-11-04T16:24:00.000Z	WishingMaster	jrib	what is the command to open a file in console window,pls give an example?
2009-11-04T16:25:00.000Z	jrib	WishingMaster	less /path/to/file
2009-11-04T16:25:00.000Z	WishingMaster	jrib	ok
2009-11-04T16:26:00.000Z	WishingMaster	jrib	is there a specific thing i should look for in xorg.log?
2009-11-04T16:26:00.000Z	jrib	WishingMaster	there's no such thing as xorg.log.  It's /var/log/Xorg.0.log .  Capitalization is important.  You should probably pastebin it and include it in your problem description
