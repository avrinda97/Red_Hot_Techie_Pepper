2006-08-06T08:00:00.000Z	harm_		i r need reformat :|
2006-08-06T08:00:00.000Z	Backeman	harm_	I have run terminal for a few year, but Im gettin lazy and like GUI :) So xubuntu wouldn't be to bad for the server, won't need any heavy stuff..
2006-08-06T08:01:00.000Z	harm_	Backeman	a GUI for a server is always a bad idea :S

2006-08-06T08:01:00.000Z	harm_	Backeman	it takes up space, install extra things u dont want, and like most things the simpler it is the less attention u need to give it

2006-08-06T08:19:00.000Z	harm_	Backeman	but the best way to see something is to do it
