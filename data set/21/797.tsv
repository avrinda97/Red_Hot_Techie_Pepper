2012-11-05T00:53:00.000Z	trism	s0up	anything funny in /var/log/x-?-greeter.log ?
2012-11-05T00:54:00.000Z	trism	s0up	sorry that is /var/log/lightdm/x-?-greeter.log
2012-11-05T00:54:00.000Z	s0up	trism	i do not see a greeter logs
2012-11-05T00:57:00.000Z	trism	s0up	how about lightdm.log ? is unity-greeter crashing?
2012-11-05T00:58:00.000Z	trism	s0up	dmesg might also tell you if it is
2012-11-05T00:59:00.000Z	trism	s0up	that is odd, what were you doing before it started?
2012-11-05T01:04:00.000Z	trism	s0up	you don't have a bunch of users in /etc/passwd do you? (it's an older accountservice bug)
2012-11-05T01:05:00.000Z	trism	s0up	would you mind pastebin lightdm.log and the greeter log (if there is anything in there)? you might also want to: sudo stop lightdm; so it calms down for the moment
2012-11-05T01:09:00.000Z	trism	s0up	if you have network access you could use pastebinit (after installing it)

2012-11-05T01:18:00.000Z	trism	s0up	hmm, this is the point I'd love to fire up a gdb session and see what unity-greeter is doing, if you were to install lightdm-gtk-greeter and switch to that, does the greeter come up?
2012-11-05T01:20:00.000Z	trism	s0up	it's okay, don't worry about it, try installing lightdm-gtk-greeter and set greeter-session=lightdm-gtk-greeter in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and start lightdm
2012-11-05T01:21:00.000Z	trism	s0up	no problem, it is a curious issue, I'm wondering if logging into the ubuntu session will give you the same sort of issues even without unity-greeter
2012-11-05T01:23:00.000Z	trism	s0up	so you managed to log in with lightdm-gtk-greeter? or not?
2012-11-05T01:23:00.000Z	trism	s0up	system seem okay? nothing using a ton of mem or cpu?
2012-11-05T01:24:00.000Z	trism	s0up	good to hear, at least it seems to be a specific bug in unity-greeter
2012-11-05T01:24:00.000Z	trism	s0up	can you pastebin the updates you did today, yesterday from /var/log/apt/history.log ?
2012-11-05T01:25:00.000Z	s0up	trism	https://paste.tinyw.in/index.php/view/50578805
2012-11-05T01:28:00.000Z	trism	s0up	oh hmm, I see the new glib/gtk from the gnome ppa
2012-11-05T01:28:00.000Z	trism	s0up	that would be my first guess
2012-11-05T01:29:00.000Z	trism	s0up	just a user
