2008-09-01T18:01:00.000Z	adi_		can anyone help me with issues of wireless intel pro 3945 abg on ubuntu 7.10
2008-09-01T18:02:00.000Z	adi_		my wireless card 3945 does not work
2008-09-01T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi_	can we have the wireless line from lspci
2008-09-01T18:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi_	its the config of uuntu so you're in the right place
2009-07-07T18:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi_	does anything show up in: sudo fdisk -l
2009-07-07T18:51:00.000Z	adi_	ActionParsnip	no, it shows me only the sda and sdb. sda it's the hard of the pc and sdb it's a sd card
2009-07-07T18:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi_	hmm
2010-06-10T22:35:00.000Z	adi_	ActionParsnip	i tried camorama* and it said there's no /dev/video*
2011-10-27T18:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi_	if you run:  smbtree  on the server, do you see the shares?
2011-10-27T18:45:00.000Z	adi_	ActionParsnip	smbtree shows nothing, apparently
2011-10-27T18:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi_	then the shares are not right
2011-10-27T18:46:00.000Z	adi_	ActionParsnip	I also tried configuring from various GUIs, like koomba2, smb4k or 'samba' (from ubuntu software center)
2011-10-27T18:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi_	I can give you my smb.conf if you want
2011-10-27T18:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/720754/
2011-10-27T18:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi_	you only need the bottom sections
2011-10-27T19:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi_	use pastebinit at cli, much easier ;)
2011-10-27T19:05:00.000Z	adi_	ActionParsnip	apparently, trying to paste other things works, just the smb.conf file hangs indefinitely :(
2011-10-27T19:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi_	bizarre
2011-10-27T19:08:00.000Z	adi_	ActionParsnip	even "pastebinit -i /etc/samba/smb.conf" hangs forever
2011-10-27T19:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi_	try copying the file to $HOME and pastebin that
