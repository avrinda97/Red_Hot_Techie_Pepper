2006-04-07T14:13:00.000Z	zipper		Can any of you guys recommend a good instant messenger client that i can use with the msn messenger protocol (and icq if possible, but not important) where i can see the ip of the people i have on my list?
2006-04-07T14:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	zipper	GAIM
2006-04-07T14:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	zipper	kopete also supports icq aim msn iirc
2006-04-07T14:13:00.000Z	zipper	IdleOne	i'm using gaim right now, but i cannot see the ip of the people who are on my list? Or am i just not looking hard enough?
2006-04-07T14:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	zipper	i dont know about that i dont use instant messaging . Im an irc kinda guy
2006-04-07T14:15:00.000Z	IdleOne	zipper	there is also Trillian but i dont know if it supports Linux
2006-04-07T14:16:00.000Z	zipper	IdleOne	does trillian have the ability to look up the ip of the people on my list?
2006-04-07T14:18:00.000Z	zipper	IdleOne	i'm sorry for bothering you again, but i never got an answer. If i use trillian, can i see the ip of the people on my msn list?
2006-04-07T14:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	zipper	np bother and I am not certain but it isnt open source and will have to pay for the full version and it is windows only
2006-04-07T14:20:00.000Z	zipper	IdleOne	aww, thats harsh. I could live with closed source and windows only, but i can't get myself to pay for an IM client. Thanks though
2006-04-07T14:20:00.000Z	IdleOne	zipper	give kopete a try: sudo apt-get install kopete
2007-08-10T06:12:00.000Z	IdleOne	zipper	/server irc.newnetwork.com PORT#
2007-08-10T06:12:00.000Z	zipper	IdleOne	great, thanks
2007-09-19T06:03:00.000Z	zipper	IdleOne	but now that i have actually bought the song, i should be able to play it. There must be some way to get rid of DRM? I've heard something about "fair2use" ?
2007-09-19T06:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	zipper	I dont know about that or how to remove the DRM. sorry :/
2007-09-19T06:05:00.000Z	IdleOne	zipper	I hear ya but we cannot help you circumvent the law
2007-09-19T06:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	zipper	but what we say can unintentioanly put someone else in jail or even us
2007-09-19T06:07:00.000Z	zipper	IdleOne	as i said, i believe it is legal in my country to remove drm, so no harm should be done by that
2007-09-19T06:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	zipper	it is illegal in my country and I will not help you . sorry
2007-09-19T06:09:00.000Z	zipper	IdleOne	i'm sorry, i left a bit early, didnt manage to read your reply. Mind pasting it again?
2007-09-19T06:10:00.000Z	IdleOne	zipper	it is offtopic and I am bored with the subject. my answer is NO
