2009-01-11T01:44:00.000Z	Galadx		anyone know why 8.04 comes up as a rar unlike 8.10
2009-01-11T01:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	Galadx	 Im not sure that anyone knows what you mean by saying 'comes up as a rar'
2009-01-11T01:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	Galadx	 if you mean to say that you downloaded a .iso file to your windows machine, and winrar is poping up when you click on the .iso Its because winrar  has decided to bset it self as the default app for .iso files..  (which is not too handy)
2009-01-11T01:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	Galadx	 you may want to download  imgburn for burning iso files under windows.  http://www.imgburn.com/
2009-01-11T01:47:00.000Z	Galadx	dr_willis	ok, so if i burn it its still going to burn the same right?
2009-01-11T01:47:00.000Z	Galadx	dr_willis	i have it already
2009-01-11T01:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	Galadx	 your system has winrar set to load the .iso is the whole issue..
2009-01-11T01:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	Galadx	  make imgburn the default app.
2009-01-11T01:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	Galadx	 i dont do windows support. :)  so no idea.
2009-01-11T01:49:00.000Z	Galadx	dr_willis	I got it
2009-01-11T01:50:00.000Z	Galadx	dr_willis	does installing ubuntu wipe my hard drives or do i have to do that first?
2009-01-11T01:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	Galadx	 depends on hwat you tell the installer to do. You can easially fdisk/delete the partitions first if you want
2009-01-11T01:51:00.000Z	Galadx	dr_willis	so it will gimme the option? (I want to, i have a virus) I'm installing it on my laptop, this is my desktop
2009-01-11T01:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	Galadx	 the disk partitionign tool can delete the partitions..
2009-01-11T01:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	Galadx	 or i recall it asking to 'use the whole drive' also
2009-01-11T01:53:00.000Z	Galadx	dr_willis	Im still burni8nf the cd... the last cd i tried didn't work... i got errors...
2009-01-11T01:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	Galadx	 i tnd to use unetbootin, and make bootable thumbdrives for my installs.
2009-01-11T02:09:00.000Z	Galadx	dr_willis	so i installed it, and im going through the setup, will it ask to partition the drives?
2009-01-11T02:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	Galadx	 it should.. read what the isntaller says and see. i recall it asking  'use all of the disk' and other questions
2009-01-11T02:18:00.000Z	Galadx	dr_willis	it said something about using the whole drive I think, then it had a bubble option under it
