2005-02-22T12:01:00.000Z	lavigj		guys, any idea what killed my wireless? I ran an update, it stopped working. I tried rolling back to the old madwifi drivers, nothing. the card works in windows so I think it si a config issue. Can I just totally take my wireless settings back to square one?
2005-02-22T12:02:00.000Z	carthik	lavigj	what were you using to make it work before?
2005-02-22T12:03:00.000Z	lavigj	carthik	I was using the madwifi drivers... it pretty much just worked.
2005-02-22T12:03:00.000Z	lavigj	carthik	I am about at my wits end here...
2005-02-22T12:06:00.000Z	lavigj	carthik	any suggestions?
2005-02-22T12:11:00.000Z	carthik	lavigj	sorry was away for a bit - I have not used madwifi, ever, so I wouldn't know. Try do a $sudo ifdown <your-interface> , and then an ifup, if you haven't already
2005-02-22T12:11:00.000Z	lavigj	carthik	done.
2005-02-22T12:11:00.000Z	lavigj	carthik	any suggestion on how to blow it all out?
2005-02-22T12:12:00.000Z	carthik	lavigj	apt-get remove <name-of-module> ?
2005-02-22T12:12:00.000Z	carthik	lavigj	and then an install, again..
2005-02-22T12:12:00.000Z	lavigj	carthik	did in synaptics actually
2005-02-22T12:12:00.000Z	carthik	lavigj	that's okay, in Synaptic, right click and remove the package, with all the files taht go with it, then
2005-02-22T12:13:00.000Z	carthik	lavigj	then try installing it again....
2005-02-22T12:13:00.000Z	carthik	lavigj	if the module has an associated service, try restarting it first...
2005-02-22T12:14:00.000Z	lavigj	carthik	yeah, i did that. I may try restarting again though, I hadn't thought of a module problem
2005-02-22T12:14:00.000Z	lavigj	carthik	I just realized the time, i need to get going. i appreciate the suggestion on the module
2005-02-22T12:14:00.000Z	carthik		like /etc/init.d/<module-name> stop (and then start)
2005-02-22T12:14:00.000Z	lavigj	carthik	thanks for that suggestion... I just want it to work becauswe I have no idea why it stopped.
2005-02-22T12:14:00.000Z	carthik	lavigj	looking in /etc/init.d/ will tell you if there is a module...
2005-02-22T12:15:00.000Z	carthik	lavigj	I know the feeling :| good luck
2005-02-22T12:15:00.000Z	lavigj	carthik	thanks
