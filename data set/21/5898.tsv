2007-07-16T15:38:00.000Z	leagris	matkix	I look like the driver you are trying to comile 0.3.6  is not compatible with the kernel version 2.6.20-15-generic used int Ubuntu.
2007-07-16T15:38:00.000Z	matkix	leagris	So what do you think I should do, I'm following this guide. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=3081
2007-07-16T15:40:00.000Z	leagris	matkix	you should search for a newer version of the driver that can compile for your kernel version
2007-07-16T15:42:00.000Z	leagris	matkix	there is a newer version of the triver here http://www.ralinktech.com/ralink/Home/Support/Linux.html
2007-07-16T15:43:00.000Z	matkix	leagris	So what changed would I need to make over what is listed in my guide?
2007-07-16T15:43:00.000Z	matkix	leagris	Is that the first one on the list?
2007-07-16T15:43:00.000Z	leagris	matkix	yes
2007-07-16T15:44:00.000Z	matkix	leagris	What about the other question?
2007-07-16T15:44:00.000Z	matkix	leagris	So what changed would I need to make over what is listed in my guide?
2007-07-16T15:44:00.000Z	matkix	leagris	Its the wireless part of the guide
2007-07-16T15:44:00.000Z	leagris	matkix	Once the new driver compile ok, the guide should be ok
2007-07-16T15:45:00.000Z	matkix	leagris	So I don't do the same before the compile?
2007-07-16T15:46:00.000Z	leagris	matkix	replace the source and follow-up the compilation stage
