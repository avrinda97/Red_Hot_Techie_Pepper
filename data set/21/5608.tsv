2008-04-11T23:34:00.000Z	shtoom		hi all of a sudden I've lost sound on my laptop and all the multimedia applications are simply hanging now
2008-04-11T23:34:00.000Z	shtoom		I am using ubuntu gusty
2008-04-11T23:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shtoom	please explain what all you did or installed prior to the problem
2008-04-11T23:35:00.000Z	shtoom	Jack_Sparrow	: as far as i can remember i've run update-manager
2008-04-11T23:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shtoom	Have you added any custom repos?  as in NON-standard ones
2008-04-11T23:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shtoom	no.. not universe..  here run this..  sudo apt-get install pastebinit  && cat /etc/apt/sources.list | pastebinit (Provide Pastebin link in channel)
2008-04-11T23:40:00.000Z	shtoom	Jack_Sparrow	here is the link http://pastebin.com/d2fc84707
2008-04-11T23:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shtoom	Problem was easy to spot.. you used automatix.. and the upgrade borked you ..
2008-04-11T23:42:00.000Z	shtoom	Jack_Sparrow	but I've rarely used automatix directly
2008-04-11T23:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shtoom	I guarantee that is your problem and unless you have a backup prior to using/installing automatix.  I dont have any solutions
2008-04-11T23:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shtoom	Constantly have people with that issue
2008-04-11T23:45:00.000Z	shtoom	Jack_Sparrow	But I see every time what update-manager is installing nothing sound related was upgraded before losing it
2008-04-11T23:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shtoom	Your source list has feisty repos, gutsy repos automatix repos plus backports
2008-04-11T23:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shtoom	Sorry, cant help with your situation..
2008-04-11T23:47:00.000Z	shtoom	Jack_Sparrow	Thanks for your time I'll dig deeper into it
2008-12-11T22:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shtoom	if not under home you will need sudo
2008-12-11T22:20:00.000Z	shtoom	Jack_Sparrow	I am root on the server
2008-12-11T22:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shtoom	you may have the path wrong
2008-12-11T22:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shtoom	setting a root pw is not advised
2008-12-11T22:27:00.000Z	shtoom	Jack_Sparrow	: rm says there is not such file are directory but ls displays it
2008-12-11T22:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shtoom	I cant help with that mess, not sure what happened to that
