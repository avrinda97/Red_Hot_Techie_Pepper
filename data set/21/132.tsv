2012-09-18T18:42:00.000Z	SaCruM		Question: My mozilla thunderbird don't get my e-mails automatically. Only if i open the application. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.. Is there a way to fix it or an alternative program that runs well on Ubuntu?
2012-09-18T18:43:00.000Z	bazhang	SaCruM	he may be thinking of evolution
2012-09-18T18:44:00.000Z	SaCruM	bazhang	and evolution is shown on the mail thingy next to my clock?
2012-09-18T18:44:00.000Z	bazhang	SaCruM	should do, yes; if you mean check mail etc under the envelope icon
2012-09-18T18:45:00.000Z	SaCruM	bazhang	yes. I'll install it, thanks. By the way, evolution is the native e-mail client on kubuntu, right?
2012-09-18T18:45:00.000Z	bazhang	SaCruM	not sure on that; perhaps ask in #kubuntu
2012-09-18T18:45:00.000Z	SaCruM	bazhang	well thank you very much :)
2012-09-18T18:45:00.000Z	bazhang	SaCruM	its kmail iirc
2012-09-18T20:19:00.000Z	bazhang	SaCruM	no need to repaste so quickly, give us a moment to check for the answer
2012-09-18T20:19:00.000Z	SaCruM	bazhang	i'm sorry.
2012-09-18T20:20:00.000Z	SaCruM	bazhang	i don't know :x
2012-09-18T20:20:00.000Z	bazhang	SaCruM	then check
2012-09-18T20:21:00.000Z	SaCruM	bazhang	how can i check that? :x
2012-09-18T20:22:00.000Z	SaCruM	bazhang	oh, found it. going to install it now :D
2012-09-18T20:22:00.000Z	bazhang	SaCruM	sudo apt-get install evolution-indicator from the terminal
2012-09-18T20:23:00.000Z	SaCruM	bazhang	done. I installed it. I'll be notificated now when i receive an email?
2012-09-18T20:28:00.000Z	SaCruM	bazhang	could you pm me? :x
2012-09-18T20:28:00.000Z	bazhang	SaCruM	ask in channel
2012-09-18T20:29:00.000Z	SaCruM	bazhang	i did. i'm just a bit slow to write .. I will be recieve a notification now? becouse i mean, there is an option "mail" that won't work now. That thing i installed just made the evolution name be shown on that notification icon :x
2012-09-18T20:30:00.000Z	bazhang	SaCruM	and you fully set up evolution?
2012-09-18T20:30:00.000Z	SaCruM	bazhang	well, i guess i did.
