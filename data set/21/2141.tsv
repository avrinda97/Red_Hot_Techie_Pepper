2010-01-05T06:43:00.000Z	lstarnes	mou	that kind of abusive language is not welcome here
2010-01-05T06:44:00.000Z	lstarnes	mou	it's probably a problem with the program
2010-01-05T06:44:00.000Z	lstarnes	mou	have you tried any other vnc programs?
2010-01-05T06:44:00.000Z	lstarnes	mou	what about tightvnc?
2010-01-05T06:44:00.000Z	mou	lstarnes	yeah that's the initial thing that started with the error
2010-01-05T06:46:00.000Z	lstarnes	mou	from what I can see in the screenshot posted earlier of tightvnc, you didn't start any X clients in that session
2010-01-05T06:46:00.000Z	lstarnes	mou	such as gnome-session
2010-01-05T06:46:00.000Z	mou	lstarnes	i thought that too and i altered the xstartup file to specifically start gnome-session
2010-01-05T06:46:00.000Z	lstarnes	mou	it might not read that file
2010-01-05T06:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	mou	what about manually launching it from the terminal?
2010-01-05T06:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	mou	any errors about $DISPLAY?
