2006-12-18T15:47:00.000Z	IndyGUnFreak		right.., but people used it, and thought they were a hacker.
2006-12-18T15:47:00.000Z	IndyGUnFreak		lol
2006-12-18T15:48:00.000Z	IndyGUnFreak		what was that movie that made hacking so hip?.. where the kid started the war?
2006-12-18T15:48:00.000Z	IndyGUnFreak		geez
2006-12-18T15:49:00.000Z	IndyGUnFreak		there's no questions being asked.
2006-12-18T15:49:00.000Z	IndyGUnFreak		that i can answer.
2006-12-18T15:49:00.000Z	IndyGUnFreak		whatever
2006-12-18T15:49:00.000Z	IndyGUnFreak		so why not just do a new install?
2006-12-18T15:50:00.000Z	IndyGUnFreak		3-4hrs for an upgrade?
2006-12-18T15:50:00.000Z	IndyGUnFreak		i did a new install in 25min
2006-12-18T15:50:00.000Z	un_operateur1	IndyGUnFreak	because a new install isnt the same as an upgrade :)
2006-12-18T15:51:00.000Z	un_operateur1	IndyGUnFreak	stop asking trivia then :)
2006-12-18T15:52:00.000Z	un_operateur1	IndyGUnFreak	guess there's a reason you've got "freak" in your name eh
2006-12-18T15:52:00.000Z	un_operateur1	IndyGUnFreak	upgrading windows aint the same lol
2006-12-18T15:52:00.000Z	un_operateur1	IndyGUnFreak	dont even compare windows to ubuntu -- dont even dare
2006-12-18T15:54:00.000Z	un_operateur1	IndyGUnFreak	I've  been dist-upgrading all the way from warty eh -- no problems ever -- i wouldnt dare do a fresh install because i've gotten my system down a bare minimum that an install would just ruin
2006-12-18T15:57:00.000Z	un_operateur1	IndyGUnFreak	just dont tell people not to not dist-upgrade -- its what happens in the linux world; its almost a norm
2006-12-18T06:34:00.000Z	un_operateur1	IndyGUnFreak	its rampant and we're always suffering :)
2006-12-18T06:36:00.000Z	un_operateur1	IndyGUnFreak	whats your "icon question" ?
2006-12-18T06:38:00.000Z	un_operateur1	IndyGUnFreak	I think -- gnome-theme-manager
2006-12-18T07:27:00.000Z	un_operateur1	IndyGUnFreak	paritioning makes it easier to manage different compartments of the file system -- it increases performance . etc
