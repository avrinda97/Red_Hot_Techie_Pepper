2006-10-20T09:29:00.000Z	Peacer	Miker64	turn off your computer, press f8 when you start it up and then press cd-rom, then you will soon get a menu, press the first one and when you then get a new desktop...
2006-10-20T09:30:00.000Z	Miker64	Peacer	ok Ill try it... though I think the CD will get lost
