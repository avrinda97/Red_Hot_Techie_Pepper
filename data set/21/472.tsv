2011-11-25T02:49:00.000Z	MissingNH2		for about 20 mins.
2011-11-25T02:49:00.000Z	MissingNH2		And then try again.
2011-11-25T02:50:00.000Z	MissingNH2		Also, take the battery out, plug it in and hold the power button
2011-11-25T02:50:00.000Z	MissingNH2		if its a battery problem, then it will work perfectly
2011-11-25T02:50:00.000Z	MissingNH2		again, if its a battery issue, then taking the battery out and turning it on while its plugged in will make it work.
2011-11-25T02:51:00.000Z	MissingNH2		i have no idea what 'flashed the phone to metro' means.
2011-11-25T02:51:00.000Z	MissingNH2		then its not a battery issue.
2011-11-25T02:51:00.000Z	MissingNH2		doesn't that void your warranty?
2011-11-25T02:52:00.000Z	MissingNH2		Oh yea, speaking of unity, I had a question too which wasn't answered
2011-11-25T02:52:00.000Z	MissingNH2		Anyone know how to control the unity sidebar hotspot? So it'll come out only when I move my mouse to the bottom left vs the whole left side?
2011-11-25T02:53:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	MissingNH2	You would need to add the feature to the Unity code base to get that feature
2011-11-25T02:54:00.000Z	MissingNH2	pragmaticenigma	I was hoping it was already implemented. I'm not that familiar with Ubuntu code. :/
2011-11-25T02:55:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	MissingNH2	sadly it's what would be considered a power user feature and Ubuntu developers haven't had time to add those enhancements yet
2011-11-25T02:55:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	MissingNH2	compiz has been around for a long time now... it's stable
2011-11-25T02:56:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	MissingNH2	You should be able to re-position the bar to the bottom of the screen I would think
2011-11-25T02:57:00.000Z	MissingNH2	pragmaticenigma	Nope, there was a bug report filed, and the devs said it didn't go with the idea of Unity or somesuch
2011-11-25T02:58:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	MissingNH2	LAME!
2011-11-25T02:58:00.000Z	MissingNH2	pragmaticenigma	I'll see if I can get a link to it. Twas the longest bug report I've ever seen.
2011-11-25T02:59:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	MissingNH2	I switched away from Ubuntu to Xubuntu awhile ago when Gnome was getting too bloated and didn't even want to think about unity
2011-11-25T03:00:00.000Z	MissingNH2	pragmaticenigma	I don't know what xubuntu is, I'll look it up
2011-11-25T03:01:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	MissingNH2	Xubuntu is all the same as ubuntu but uses the Xfce window manager...
