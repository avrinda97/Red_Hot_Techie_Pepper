2006-01-25T17:43:00.000Z	Razor-X	chicken-man	please wait about 8 minutes between question iterations
2006-01-25T17:43:00.000Z	Razor-X	chicken-man	We've heard you, it's just that the answer isn't known
2006-01-25T17:43:00.000Z	chicken-man	Razor-X	I don't have time to wait, I've had problems with ubuntu for 2 days !!
2006-01-25T17:44:00.000Z	Razor-X	chicken-man	we're not being paid to offer support, so you're going to have to hold your horses, my first Linux install took 2 weeks of tweaking to get the bare essentials working ;)
2006-01-25T17:45:00.000Z	chicken-man	Razor-X	lol well it worked on my old system without any problems
2006-01-25T17:48:00.000Z	Razor-X	chicken-man	as long as the network is powered by DHCP, Ethernet would work wonders
2006-01-25T17:48:00.000Z	chicken-man	Razor-X	I don't think it can detect my ethernet card :-/
2006-01-25T17:49:00.000Z	Razor-X	chicken-man	well, a $5 Ethernet card I picked up from Comp-USA, simple Yum-Cha Comp-USA brand, works fine
2006-01-25T17:49:00.000Z	chicken-man	Razor-X	So if I put my old ethernet card in that worked with Linux it should work ?
2006-01-25T17:49:00.000Z	Razor-X	chicken-man	yeahp
2006-01-25T17:50:00.000Z	chicken-man	Razor-X	good I'll go get it and install it :P
