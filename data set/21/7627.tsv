2007-07-10T12:57:00.000Z	yigal		does anyone know if it is possible to easily set up a mail server and use it to send all of the email messages I want to my pda?
2007-07-10T12:58:00.000Z	m0	yigal	smtp?
2007-07-10T12:58:00.000Z	yigal	m0	this would be fine
2007-07-10T12:59:00.000Z	yigal	m0	is it practically doable?
2007-07-10T12:59:00.000Z	m0	yigal	you could install an smtp server on yout machine
2007-07-10T12:59:00.000Z	yigal	m0	sure, is it difficult?
2007-07-10T13:00:00.000Z	yigal	m0	that sounds very nice, exactly.  so i could use procmail to sort my messages and then send them to a "black berry" account i could make
2007-07-10T13:00:00.000Z	m0	yigal	would sendmail be good?
2007-07-10T13:01:00.000Z	m0	yigal	there are many smtp, apt-cache search smtp
2007-07-10T13:01:00.000Z	yigal	m0	i think this would work
2007-07-10T13:02:00.000Z	m0	yigal	basically sme thing that php will access
2007-07-10T13:02:00.000Z	yigal	m0	why do i need php?
2007-07-10T13:02:00.000Z	yigal	m0	in this case?
2007-07-10T13:03:00.000Z	m0	yigal	I meant php uses the sendmail function
2007-07-10T13:03:00.000Z	m0	yigal	you could use teapop for pop3 server
2007-07-10T13:03:00.000Z	yigal	m0	maybe imap server would be better, then i wouldn't even have to store the messages on my pda.
2007-07-10T13:04:00.000Z	yigal	m0	but you are saying it is possible and not that difficult to get some system to work
2007-07-10T13:04:00.000Z	yigal	m0	?
2007-07-10T13:07:00.000Z	m0	yigal	if you would like IMAP then try courier-imap package
2007-07-10T13:07:00.000Z	yigal	m0	i will check it out
2007-07-10T13:08:00.000Z	m0	yigal	take a look at section 12 here: http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.06_p5
