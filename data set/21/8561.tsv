2008-10-28T04:54:00.000Z	alesan		I hope they deliver a new kernel, the one I have takes so long to resume from suspend my thinkpad
2008-10-28T04:54:00.000Z	esac	alesan	which thinkpad do you have ?
2008-10-28T04:55:00.000Z	alesan	esac	T61
2008-10-28T04:56:00.000Z	esac	alesan	t61p here, in hardy i was having the same issue. i got a new hal pushed down, and at the same time i used envy-ng to switch to the 177 driver and it fixed the issue for me
2008-10-28T04:56:00.000Z	esac		177 nvidia driver that is
2008-10-28T04:56:00.000Z	alesan	esac	uh? can you explain? what is a new hal "pushed down"??
2008-10-28T04:57:00.000Z	esac	alesan	software update
2008-10-28T04:57:00.000Z	alesan		what is envy-ng? 177 driver of what?
2008-10-28T04:57:00.000Z	esac	alesan	nvidia
2008-10-28T04:57:00.000Z	alesan	esac	I do not have nvidia graphics brrr...
2008-10-28T04:57:00.000Z	alesan		I have intel
2008-10-28T04:57:00.000Z	esac	alesan	hmm, maybe it was the hal that did it then
2008-10-28T04:59:00.000Z	alesan	esac	how did you install that new HAL?
2008-10-28T05:00:00.000Z	esac	alesan	although maybe hope for you. intrepid just suspended in about 5-10 seconds and resumed in 2-3 on my t61p with no issues
2008-10-28T05:01:00.000Z	alesan	esac	I'm still on the previous one
2008-10-28T05:01:00.000Z	alesan	esac	that is the name, the 'h' one
2008-10-28T05:01:00.000Z	esac	alesan	yes, hardy
2008-10-28T05:01:00.000Z	alesan	esac	that is why I hope they will upgrade the kernel in intrepid
2008-10-28T05:01:00.000Z	esac	alesan	im saying when it is released at the end of this month you might want to try it
2008-10-28T05:01:00.000Z	alesan	esac	of course I will upgrade
2008-10-28T05:01:00.000Z	esac	alesan	they did upgrade the kernel. it is 2.6.27-7 at this point, versus 2.6.24-21 in hardy
