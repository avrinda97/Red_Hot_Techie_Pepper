2007-12-14T13:52:00.000Z	_slacker__		i changed a few settings and now don't mount
2007-12-14T13:52:00.000Z	_slacker__		i want to rollback
2007-12-14T13:53:00.000Z	tuntun	_slacker__	I think you want "/etc/fstab"
2007-12-14T13:54:00.000Z	_slacker__	tuntun	no no, it's an external usb disk, i plugged it in, change a few setting on the Volume Properties, and when try to remount it fails
2007-12-14T13:55:00.000Z	_slacker__	tuntun	so i want to rollback that changes
2007-12-14T13:55:00.000Z	tuntun	_slacker__	how did you "change a few setting on the Volume Properties"?
2007-12-14T13:56:00.000Z	_slacker__	tuntun	right click on the mounted device => properties => Volume
2007-12-14T13:57:00.000Z	tuntun	_slacker__	so what did you change?
2007-12-14T13:59:00.000Z	_slacker__	tuntun	the fmask and dmask
2007-12-14T13:59:00.000Z	_slacker__	tuntun	i think it's gnome-volume who manage these setting right?
2007-12-14T14:00:00.000Z	_slacker__	tuntun	where can i delete my custom setting?
2007-12-14T14:03:00.000Z	tuntun	_slacker__	cant you do that in the same place that you changed them?
2007-12-14T14:03:00.000Z	_slacker__	tuntun	no, because i can't mount the device now, i right-clicked the icon of the mounted device in the desktop
2007-12-14T14:03:00.000Z	_slacker__	tuntun	but i already solved it :)
