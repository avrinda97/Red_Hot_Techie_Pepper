2010-02-08T11:07:00.000Z	dbluefield		thanx Jordan
2010-02-08T11:09:00.000Z	dbluefield		I've burned the Ubuntu ISO onto disk and will try to boot it --my windows XP boc has a C/drive(windowsOS) and a partitioned E drive for extras -- where will Ubuntu install?
2010-02-08T11:10:00.000Z	dbluefield		didnt understand that juan
2010-02-08T11:10:00.000Z	dbluefield		will it add another partition?
2010-02-08T11:11:00.000Z	dbluefield		when I turn the computer on - do I get a choice between windows and ubuntu?
2010-02-08T11:11:00.000Z	dbluefield		is that in the Bios --what does it look like?
2010-02-08T11:12:00.000Z	indus	dbluefield	it comes after the bios
2010-02-08T11:13:00.000Z	indus	dbluefield	stick with ext 3
2010-02-08T11:15:00.000Z	indus	dbluefield	i say stick with ext3 its proven
2010-02-08T11:21:00.000Z	indus	dbluefield	it will not !
2010-02-08T11:22:00.000Z	indus	dbluefield	dual boot is the most pratical way of installing linux
2010-02-08T11:23:00.000Z	indus	dbluefield	here is some neat advice, one partition of say 10 gb for / , the rest for /home and size of ram for /swap
2010-02-08T11:24:00.000Z	indus	dbluefield	thats of course if you have manual partitioning,
2010-02-08T11:24:00.000Z	indus	dbluefield	ubuntu doesnt make any unless you tell it
2010-02-08T11:25:00.000Z	indus	dbluefield	what is on E ?
2010-02-08T11:26:00.000Z	indus	dbluefield	first things first, just install it , then comes wine
2010-02-08T11:30:00.000Z	indus	dbluefield	you need to enter into bios by pressing some key say f12 f8 etc or maybe del key
2010-02-08T11:32:00.000Z	indus	dbluefield	good luck :)
2010-02-11T21:38:00.000Z	indus	dbluefield	mm why mess with xorg
