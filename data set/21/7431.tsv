2007-08-11T13:40:00.000Z	compwiz	SwiftNomAd	do you have a spare keyboard?
2007-08-11T13:40:00.000Z	compwiz	SwiftNomAd	do you have any other keyboards?
2007-08-11T13:40:00.000Z	compwiz	SwiftNomAd	did you try rebooting?
2007-08-11T13:42:00.000Z	compwiz	SwiftNomAd	did you edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf recently?
2007-08-11T13:43:00.000Z	compwiz	SwiftNomAd	and this is when they keyboard started doing that?
2007-08-11T13:44:00.000Z	compwiz	SwiftNomAd	it never did this in Windows?
2007-08-11T13:44:00.000Z	compwiz	SwiftNomAd	do you still have windows installed?
2007-08-11T13:45:00.000Z	compwiz	SwiftNomAd	do you have the linux livecd?
2007-08-11T13:45:00.000Z	compwiz	SwiftNomAd	you may want to put that in and see if the keyboard behaves weirdly
2007-08-11T13:46:00.000Z	compwiz	SwiftNomAd	if it does, the keyboard has a problem, most likely
2007-08-11T13:46:00.000Z	compwiz	SwiftNomAd	good luck :)
2007-08-11T13:47:00.000Z	compwiz	SwiftNomAd	no problem :)
