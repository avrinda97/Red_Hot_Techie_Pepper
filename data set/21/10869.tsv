2006-01-18T15:12:00.000Z	lukus001		does anyone know how to stop my desktop graphics from crashing? i cant really do anything when the whole screen goes all differerent colours?
2006-01-18T15:12:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	describe the issue a bit better....
2006-01-18T15:14:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	sounds like hardware problem -- video card overheating?
2006-01-18T15:16:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	could be a bug in Xorg, but that's unlikely. Which video card?
2006-01-18T15:18:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	that sounds new enough it could be a bit problematic.
2006-01-18T15:20:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	it is new and weird enough that it may be that well supported.
2006-01-18T15:20:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	what do you use it for?
2006-01-18T15:22:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	any accelerated 3D use?
2006-01-18T15:22:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	any high performance requirements?
2006-01-18T15:23:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	because if you use 3D you can always use the proprietary binary drivers from NVIDIA and hope they work better.
2006-01-18T15:24:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	also, a 6200 is good enough to play many pretty good games, from Quake3 upwards.
2006-01-18T15:24:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	yes, that.
2006-01-18T15:25:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	it is good enough for quite a few games, including Doom3 etc. In low res/quality. For Quake3 etc. it is gouing to be pretty fast.
2006-01-18T15:25:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	5FPS sounds more like improperly install binary drivers.
2006-01-18T15:25:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	or no installed. lets' see.
2006-01-18T15:28:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	wait a bit more...
2006-01-18T15:33:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	wait a bit more...
2006-01-18T15:33:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	I am trying to find a review I saw with fairly impressive numbers for a 6200.
2006-01-18T15:34:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	in the meantime you can look at the Ubuntu Wiki on how to do a proper installation of the NVIDIA driver.
2006-01-18T15:35:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	and it crashes?
2006-01-18T15:35:00.000Z	Blissex	lukus001	look at this and rejoice: http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=2238&p=7
