2005-02-28T08:35:00.000Z	rel		what i cannot figure is why when I select evolution-exchange for removal, apt wants to remove ubuntu-desktop metapackage
2005-02-28T08:36:00.000Z	hawke	rel	Because ubuntu-desktop depends on evolution-exchange
2005-02-28T08:37:00.000Z	rel	hawke	applies to fetchmail and webcal too. So, it doesnt remove all the packages what ubuntu-desktop provides
2005-02-28T08:39:00.000Z	hawke	rel	No...but if you're tracking hoary, you might want to keep an eye on ubuntu-desktop's depends so you can install the new stuff that it adds as time goes on.
2005-02-28T08:43:00.000Z	rel	hawke	in other words. with this metapackage removed I cannot upgrade its dependancies? And should apt-get it. Then it will reinstall the packages I just removed? Im dutch and my englisch isnt so good :/
2005-02-28T08:44:00.000Z	hawke	rel	You can upgrade its dependencies.  But if it depends on a new package, the new package will not automatically be pulled in.
2005-02-28T08:45:00.000Z	hawke	rel	if you watch the version number, and do 'apt-get install ubuntu-desktop' when it changes, you will get a list of other packages that it wants to pull in from dependencies, and then manually install those.
2005-02-28T08:45:00.000Z	rel	hawke	oke.. understand it. guess apt will mention that to me if these new pkgs where added. Il manually apt them if needed
2005-02-28T08:46:00.000Z	rel	hawke	okay. ty
2005-02-28T08:48:00.000Z	hawke	rel	I have, but IMO apt is quite better.
2005-02-28T08:49:00.000Z	rel	hawke	no doubt. second place is portage. they just need to provide a binary repository
2005-02-28T09:02:00.000Z	hawke	rel	Have you investigated the package 'kernel-package' for building a custom kernel?
2005-02-28T09:10:00.000Z	rel	hawke	about to..
2005-02-28T09:10:00.000Z	hawke	rel	If you need help, I exist.
2005-02-28T09:11:00.000Z	rel	hawke	thanks mate!
2005-02-28T09:13:00.000Z	hawke	rel	which is not to suggest that my existence is dependent on your need for assistance.
2005-02-28T09:13:00.000Z	rel	hawke	that package wants gcc3.3, any chance that I can set gcc3.4 for the compilations
2005-02-28T09:13:00.000Z	hawke	rel	Not sure, I think the kernel just uses whatever is 'gcc'
2005-02-28T09:13:00.000Z	rel	hawke	we all exist because we depend on eatchother somehow
2005-02-28T09:14:00.000Z	hawke	rel	This is true.
2005-03-07T14:04:00.000Z	rel	hawke	seen that, installed it. but version 0.3.8 sups dvd. and in repo onlt 0.3.6
