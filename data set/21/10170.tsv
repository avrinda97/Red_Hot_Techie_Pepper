2005-04-27T12:13:00.000Z	IIIEars		i was wrestling with knoppix for awhile - always fearing malware would cause me to lose the time invested setting up/tweaking it. Ubuntu is painless. (er, okay i haven't set up IPTables. - lol)
2005-04-27T12:14:00.000Z	IIIEars		Firestarter is installed? (crosses fingers) preconfigured?
2005-04-27T12:15:00.000Z	IIIEars		hm - even a n00b like me could do that much - lol
