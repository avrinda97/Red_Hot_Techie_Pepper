2008-08-31T02:36:00.000Z	RB2		When I go into Hardware Drives, the nVidia drivers are marked as enabled, but show "Not In Use". Why would this happen?
2008-08-31T02:36:00.000Z	RB2		Hardware drivers even
2008-08-31T02:37:00.000Z	usser	RB2	did u restart after u installed them?
2008-08-31T02:37:00.000Z	RB2	usser	yeah. X has been a bit messed up since I had to repair it via the Recovery Mode.
2008-08-31T02:37:00.000Z	usser	RB2	did u use restricted manager or did u install the drivers from nvidia.com?
2008-08-31T02:38:00.000Z	RB2	usser	the restricted manager
2008-08-31T02:38:00.000Z	RB2	usser	but now I'm making progress. before nvidia-xconfig was yellow about missing a device driver line. Now, it ran alright with no grumbling.
2008-08-31T02:39:00.000Z	RB2		s/yellow/yelling
2008-08-31T02:39:00.000Z	usser	RB2	hm, that is weird. can u do lsmod | grep nvidia. See whats displayed also do glxinfo | grep direct
2008-08-31T02:40:00.000Z	RB2	usser	sure. This all started when I installed the drivers for a cable tuner card. I've since removed those drivers.
2008-08-31T02:41:00.000Z	RB2	usser	the only one that returned anything was glxinfo: http://pastebin.com/d5a526a06
2008-08-31T02:42:00.000Z	usser	RB2	so lsmod | grep nvidia didnt return anything. err its glxinfo | grep direct not lsmod | grep glxinfo
2008-08-31T02:43:00.000Z	RB2	usser	ahhh I thought you were list a bunch of grep parameters. ;)
2008-08-31T02:43:00.000Z	usser	RB2	brb try sudo modprobe nvidia see what errors that spits out
2008-08-31T02:44:00.000Z	RB2	usser	glibx | grep direct: http://pastebin.com/d64d42c9f
2008-08-31T02:45:00.000Z	RB2	usser	the modprobe did nothing, just returned
2008-08-31T02:46:00.000Z	RB2	usser	I re-ran the nvidia-xconfig, so I'm going to reboot and I'll be back in a moment.
2008-08-31T02:53:00.000Z	RB2	usser	it's working now. :D
2008-08-31T02:53:00.000Z	usser	RB2	nice. im glad to hear that
2008-08-31T02:53:00.000Z	RB2	usser	the nvidia drivers are back and compiz is happy. Thanks for your time!
2008-08-31T02:54:00.000Z	usser	RB2	no problem
