2008-10-15T03:26:00.000Z	hunthunthunt_		Trying to upgrade php with aptitude - have downloaded php5_5.2.4-2ubuntu5.3_all.deb
2008-10-15T03:26:00.000Z	hunthunthunt_		to /usr/src but get an error when sudo aptitude install php5_5.2.4-2ubuntu5.3_all.deb
2008-10-15T03:26:00.000Z	jrib	hunthunthunt_	umm, just use aptitude upgrade.  You'll get the latest php in the repositories
2008-10-15T03:27:00.000Z	hunthunthunt_	jrib	 so -  aptidude upgrade php5?
2008-10-15T03:28:00.000Z	jrib	hunthunthunt_	no.  Just 'aptitude upgrade' will upgrade all the packages it can.  If you just want to upgrade package X specifically, then do 'aptitude install X'
2008-10-15T03:28:00.000Z	hunthunthunt_	jrib	 awesome - thanks :)
2008-10-15T03:28:00.000Z	jrib		!apt > hunthunthunt_
2008-10-15T03:30:00.000Z	hunthunthunt_	jrib	 Unfort did not solve my problem - latest GD library is not included in Ubuntu's PHP
2008-10-15T03:33:00.000Z	jrib	hunthunthunt_	is php5-gd what you want?
2008-10-15T03:34:00.000Z	hunthunthunt_	jrib	The version of php5-gd is out of date in Ubuntu - I need the latest
2008-10-15T03:35:00.000Z	jrib	hunthunthunt_	why is it out of date?
2008-10-15T03:35:00.000Z	jrib	hunthunthunt_	what's missing is what I mean
2008-10-15T03:35:00.000Z	hunthunthunt_	jrib	See - http://cumu.li/2008/5/13/recompiling-php5-with-bundled-support-for-gd-on-ubuntu
2008-10-15T03:38:00.000Z	jrib	hunthunthunt_	you are saying two different things.  On the one hand, you want the latest version of the library.  On the other hand you want php to use the bundled version of gd.  What do you want to do?
2008-10-15T03:38:00.000Z	hunthunthunt_	jrib	 I def want the latest :)
2008-10-15T03:39:00.000Z	jrib	hunthunthunt_	ok, bet then we come back to my original question.  What exactly is missing from the version ubuntu has?
2008-10-15T03:40:00.000Z	hunthunthunt_	jrib	Image manipulation - filters, rotate etc
2008-10-15T03:44:00.000Z	jrib	hunthunthunt_	don't know enough about libgd to help you.  I don't know which libgd you need to have those things, the bundled one or not
2008-10-15T03:45:00.000Z	hunthunthunt_	jrib	np - thanks for yr help :)
