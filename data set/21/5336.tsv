2007-11-06T22:30:00.000Z	gnurph69		okay - I'm running KDE (originally installed kubuntu) but I've had enough of it.  How can I install the gnome desktop from apt-get?  the stupid KDE "Add/Remove Programs" doesn't even give an option to install the gnome desktop stuff.
2007-11-06T22:30:00.000Z	superpigs	gnurph69	sudo apt-get install gnome
2007-11-06T22:30:00.000Z	superpigs	gnurph69	or try gnomedesktop
2007-11-06T22:31:00.000Z	superpigs	gnurph69	but might i advise you to look into the xfce desktop before you do gnome?
2007-11-06T22:32:00.000Z	gnurph69	superpigs	 xfce?  why?  isn't that a remote control system?
2007-11-06T22:32:00.000Z	gnurph69	superpigs	 ah, you mean a totally different desktop.
2007-11-06T22:32:00.000Z	superpigs	gnurph69	xfce is a lightwight GUI that looks both better and works better then gnome and kde. just a tip. look at their url before you do gnome.
2007-11-06T22:33:00.000Z	gnurph69	superpigs	 part of the ubuntu universe, or do I have to download and install from them?
2007-11-06T22:33:00.000Z	superpigs	gnurph69	http://www.xfce.org/ check it out. i think you can add some stuff in the repository list and do the sudo apt get
2007-11-06T22:36:00.000Z	superpigs	gnurph69	sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
2007-11-06T22:37:00.000Z	gnurph69	superpigs	 ah, this is the default desktop for xubuntu.
2007-11-06T22:37:00.000Z	superpigs	gnurph69	indeed
2007-11-06T22:37:00.000Z	superpigs	gnurph69	kubuntu = kde, ubuntu = gnom, xubuntu = xfce
2007-11-06T22:37:00.000Z	gnurph69	superpigs	 well, the gnome install is...installing.  I'll pull the trigger on xfce when it's done and take a look.
2007-11-06T22:38:00.000Z	superpigs	gnurph69	sure thing
2007-11-06T22:38:00.000Z	superpigs	gnurph69	once you get bored of thouse check out blackbox and fluxbox
2007-11-06T22:38:00.000Z	gnurph69	superpigs	 lol...and then call my friend Bill in Redmond.
2007-11-06T22:39:00.000Z	superpigs	gnurph69	lol lets not talk about that one. then i would need to get the cyklon b and load up my gas chamber he he
2007-11-06T22:41:00.000Z	gnurph69	superpigs	originally, I liked the KDE interface...but **** it's restrictive and not as useful as it appears at first glance.
2007-11-06T22:41:00.000Z	superpigs	gnurph69	i know. its like windows. you are like me. you want it sleek, usefull and looking good. you will probably end up using xfce.
2007-11-06T22:41:00.000Z	superpigs	gnurph69	but its okey. try them all. its nice experience
