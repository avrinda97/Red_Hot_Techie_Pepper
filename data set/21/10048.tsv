2005-05-28T15:21:00.000Z	nalioth	Recyclable	why don't you grab all the stuff mentioned at the last page you sent?
2005-05-28T15:22:00.000Z	Recyclable	nalioth	I'm trying, but none of the window themes i dl show up in the themes menu once installed
2005-05-28T15:23:00.000Z	nalioth	Recyclable	we can only try
2005-05-28T15:24:00.000Z	nalioth	Recyclable	so share your solution
2005-05-28T15:27:00.000Z	Recyclable	nalioth	i was looking in the wrong thing, lol. wasn't changing the frame in theme details, was looking for it in the general theme area
2005-05-28T15:28:00.000Z	nalioth	Recyclable	ah, well let us know of your progress (easy way to the OSX look is to buy a mac mini)
2005-05-28T15:30:00.000Z	Recyclable	nalioth	i think i prefer my a64 3000+ ;)
2005-05-28T15:31:00.000Z	nalioth	Recyclable	yes, i've been considering gettin another x86 machine (owned only macs for over 3 years) and it would probably be amd64
