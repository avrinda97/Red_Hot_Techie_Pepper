2008-09-07T23:08:00.000Z	jack__		can anyone give me a hand with gparted?
2008-09-07T23:09:00.000Z	jack__		has anyone got a problem with gparted where it doesn't detect any partitions?
2008-09-07T23:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	jack__	If you're running the gui version from the command line start it with sudo.  Never had it not detect partitions.
2008-09-07T23:10:00.000Z	jack__	Scunizi	im running it from the gparted livecd
2008-09-07T23:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	jack__	you should be good to go.  I haven't run that in a while so I can't remember the interface.  However, if it still holds true, in the upper right is a selection box for the different partitions.
2008-09-07T23:12:00.000Z	jack__	Scunizi	I know what you mean, but it says everything is unallocated space. all 242gb of my hdd
2008-09-07T23:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	jack__	sorry I'm at a loss. Do you have an OS installed on the HD? if so what? and if it's a nx what filesystem?
2008-09-07T23:13:00.000Z	jack__	Scunizi	I'm dual booting XP and gutsy
2008-09-07T23:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	jack__	have you tried running gparted from inside gutsy as a comparison?
2008-09-07T23:14:00.000Z	jack__	Scunizi	how do i find gparted in gutsy? i was looking earlier but couldnt seem to find it
2008-09-07T23:15:00.000Z	jack__	Scunizi	ah it wasn't installed, im installing now
2008-09-07T23:15:00.000Z	Scunizi	jack__	it's called partition editor ..
2008-09-07T23:15:00.000Z	jack__		oh is it
2008-09-07T23:15:00.000Z	Scunizi	jack__	after install then System/Admin/Partition Editor
2008-09-07T23:15:00.000Z	jack__	Scunizi	my bad
2008-09-07T23:15:00.000Z	Scunizi	jack__	np :)
2008-09-07T23:16:00.000Z	jack__	Scunizi	even if it does detect it, will i be able to change the partition i want, as its the linux that is mounted now i want to change
2008-09-07T23:17:00.000Z	jack__	Scunizi	nope still nothing :(
2008-09-07T23:17:00.000Z	Scunizi	jack__	nope.. to change a partition it has to be unmounted.  Weird that it doesn't detect.. I'll try mine.. it almost the same configuration.. xp/Hardy
2008-09-07T23:18:00.000Z	jack__	Scunizi	when i put in sudo fdisk /dev/sda, i get this
2008-09-07T23:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	jack__	do you only have one drive?
