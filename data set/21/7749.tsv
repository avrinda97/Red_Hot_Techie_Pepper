2006-07-26T15:11:00.000Z	warlock		Anyone know how to check the EXACT load on the cpu? I dont really understand what the 0.18/0.5 etc means on my sysinfo page (which is located at: http://dust2.mine.nu )
2006-07-26T15:11:00.000Z	warlock		how many % its using
2006-07-26T15:11:00.000Z	warlock		simple and easy :P

2006-07-26T15:12:00.000Z	sparkman	warlock	w
2006-07-26T15:12:00.000Z	sparkman	warlock	ps aux, top, w, uptime, etc
2006-07-26T15:12:00.000Z	sparkman	warlock	man w
2006-07-26T15:13:00.000Z	sparkman	warlock	basically # of threads vying for the cpu in the past 1,5,15 minutes
2006-07-26T15:15:00.000Z	sparkman	warlock	it's at the top of top
2006-07-26T15:15:00.000Z	sparkman	warlock	yes.  top.
2006-07-26T15:16:00.000Z	sparkman	warlock	man top :)  basically...
2006-07-26T15:17:00.000Z	sparkman	warlock	it's user, system, nice, idle, wait, something, something, iirc
2006-07-26T15:21:00.000Z	sparkman	warlock	i already told you that.  gkrellm is a gui and you are usigna server with (presumably) no X
2006-07-26T15:21:00.000Z	sparkman	warlock	there are other applications taht do what you need.  search for them
2006-07-26T15:23:00.000Z	sparkman	warlock	:<
2006-07-26T15:24:00.000Z	sparkman	warlock	anyways, top is just fine.  if you don't understand it's output, man top :)
2006-07-26T15:26:00.000Z	warlock	sparkman	it says 0.2% us, (us= usage?)
2006-07-26T15:27:00.000Z	sparkman	warlock	it's userland usage percent, iirc
2006-07-26T15:31:00.000Z	sparkman	warlock	but it is
2006-07-26T15:31:00.000Z	sparkman	warlock	when your load gets about 1.00
