2010-09-26T11:20:00.000Z	atxq_		I do not want to see ls like 10 times in the history; just once. is this possible?
2010-09-26T11:21:00.000Z	atxq_		in a row I understand; I want it only once in the whole history
2010-09-26T11:22:00.000Z	atxq_		I want just one instance of every cmd that I use, is this possible?
2010-09-26T11:22:00.000Z	atxq_		in all my history, I would like just to see cd .. once
2010-09-26T11:22:00.000Z	atxq_		okay
2010-09-26T11:23:00.000Z	atxq_		so if I add a script to .bashrc to not log repeated cmd, that would work?
2010-09-26T11:24:00.000Z	atxq_		thinking that maybe I can search the history first, and if cmd logged, it would not log it again
2010-09-26T11:25:00.000Z	atxq_		would this be possible? I am wondering if it is possible to search the log file before logging
2010-09-26T11:27:00.000Z	atxq_		I just do not want to log duplicate cmd
2010-09-26T11:28:00.000Z	atxq_		I hate it when I do not feel like typying and have to arrow key like 20 times to get to what I want to do
2010-09-26T11:29:00.000Z	sweetpi	atxq_	use tab completion or write a script
2010-09-26T11:29:00.000Z	atxq_		I am already thinking about this right now, but maybe with Perl
2010-09-26T11:30:00.000Z	atxq_		this option should have been implimented already in bash by now; the "do not log duplication" option
2010-09-26T11:33:00.000Z	sweetpi	atxq_	iirc the reason ive never used ignore dups is if you do: "cd /; ls; cd /tmp/foo; <evil_cmd>; cd /; ls; <up arrow><enter>" your not going to like the results. someone correct me if im wrong
2010-09-26T11:36:00.000Z	atxq_		I use history so I do not have to type stuff all the type; it is easier to arrow key it, but after seeing duplicated cmd in the history it gets annoying having to wait like a minute to get to the last instance when you used a cmd
2010-09-26T11:36:00.000Z	atxq_		just saying that there are certain moments when it would be nice to elimante duplications I guess; make life easier when you using the cli all the time
2010-09-26T11:36:00.000Z	atxq_		right?
2010-09-26T11:38:00.000Z	atxq_	Dr_Willis	what you think? I am sure many people would like this feature too
2010-09-26T11:39:00.000Z	atxq_		its all about preferences
2010-09-26T11:40:00.000Z	atxq_		preferences and options
2010-09-26T11:42:00.000Z	sweetpi	atxq_	looks like I was wrong, seems ignoredups only ignores commands you have repeated, so if you do "cd /; ls; ls; ls;" it will only log "cd /; ls"
