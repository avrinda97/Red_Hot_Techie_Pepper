2011-05-22T12:49:00.000Z	arand	windowsuser	No, 5.10 is not supported anymore
2011-05-22T12:55:00.000Z	arand	windowsuser	http://www.instantfundas.com/2010/03/boot-your-computer-from-iso-image-with.html
2011-05-22T12:56:00.000Z	arand	windowsuser	That might be useful, if you have BCD (w7 or vista)
2011-05-22T12:58:00.000Z	arand	windowsuser	Use easybcd to boot an ubuntu iso from the windoews bootloader.
2011-05-22T12:58:00.000Z	arand	windowsuser	I would assume so.
2011-05-22T13:05:00.000Z	arand	windowsuser	I would install easybcd, use that to boot a newly downloaded ubuntu iso of your choice, and then do a fresh install via that. If something goes wrong, you should be able to boot the 5.10 iso and and at least get a working system, and possibly debootstrap from there.
2011-05-22T13:08:00.000Z	arand	windowsuser	Find the option for ISO files in there, and point it to a dowanload of a new version of ubuntu.
2011-05-22T13:13:00.000Z	arand	windowsuser	I am guessing that if you reboot the computer and get to the windows boot menu (F8) you'd have the option to boot the iso now, (possibly you'd have to edit the boot menu in easybcd, or at least check it has added an extra entry)
2011-05-22T13:17:00.000Z	arand	windowsuser	Have you tried rebooting to the windows boot after doing this change?
2011-05-22T13:22:00.000Z	arand	windowsuser	EasyBCD (or similar tools) is likely the easiest way to do this, since it is a complated procedure to start off with.
2011-05-22T13:24:00.000Z	arand	windowsuser	Well if you don't want to learn it, then that's your choice, (People in ##windows might know more about the easybcd application in particular)
