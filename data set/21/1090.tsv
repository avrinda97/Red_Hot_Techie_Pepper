2011-02-05T10:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xgt001	ubuntu uses gnome + compiz/metacity by default, Lubuntu uses LXDE + openbox and is drastically lighter even than Xubuntu

2011-02-05T10:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xgt001	you can install gnome apps in LXDE if you wish

2011-02-05T11:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xgt001	you can find out more than we can tell you with a few simple websearches
