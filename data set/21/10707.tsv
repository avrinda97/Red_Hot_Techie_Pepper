2004-12-15T06:00:00.000Z	IBMAptiva		I install ubuntu, I try to reboot the machine, but it stops right before my other machine (laptop of some kind) uncompresses the kernel.
2004-12-15T06:00:00.000Z	potato_head	IBMAptiva	have you tried the other boot options in GRUB?
2004-12-15T06:01:00.000Z	IBMAptiva	potato_head	Like?
2004-12-15T06:01:00.000Z	potato_head		IBMAtiva: well I'm not sure. I think there's something like a safe mode, is there?
2004-12-15T06:02:00.000Z	IBMAptiva	potato_head	No... there is a recovery mode, but it doesnt help.

2004-12-15T06:04:00.000Z	IBMAptiva		elwood: My IBM Aptiva won't start Ubuntu after the install. It stops saying only the tings i can find when I press 'esc'

2004-12-15T06:26:00.000Z	potato_head	IBMAptiva	Hmmmm, just doing some googling.

2004-12-15T06:29:00.000Z	potato_head	IBMAptiva	if you subtract the amount of RAM that the onboard video uses, from your total RAM and pass it to linux as a boot command (ie. 'linux mem=124M' or whatever).
