2011-07-31T21:25:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Grav	i suppose you could check the plugin in what browser you use
2011-07-31T21:28:00.000Z	Grav	ThinkT510	zykotick9:  Flash version 10,3,181,14  ?
2011-07-31T21:30:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Grav	you made sure you're fully updated via the update manager?
2011-07-31T21:30:00.000Z	Grav	ThinkT510	There are updates for system too but i don't like them, they tend to break everything:/
2011-07-31T21:30:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Grav	what updates are listed?
2011-07-31T21:31:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Grav	can you see a flash or nvidia update in the update manager list?
2011-07-31T21:32:00.000Z	Grav	ThinkT510	So many time i have installed updates  to find next day that i can't login, something is not working, gnome is missing or some other crazy things. And it takes more and more space everytime. I'm using flashaid for firefox to update flash. Flash from updates never worked ok.
2011-07-31T21:33:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Grav	then i can't help you
2011-07-31T21:33:00.000Z	Grav	ThinkT510	Np i understand. I just thought there could be some setting to change.
2011-07-31T21:34:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Grav	the only thing i can suggest is to update to the latest flash
2011-07-31T21:40:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Grav	if you don't trust the updates how do you expect it to work?
2011-07-31T21:44:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Grav	and now here you are with new problems
2011-07-31T21:48:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Grav	if i didn't update i would still be having the problem you have with flash and nvidia
