2009-12-23T22:36:00.000Z	tolpico		Hello is there a bandwidth monitoring program for ubuntu like bitmeter http://codebox.org.uk/controller?page=bitmeter2   I want to monitor the network traffic at all times, probably the app sitting at a corner. Thanks.
2009-12-23T22:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tolpico	conky or gkrellm have real time network monitors (there are probably many more)
2009-12-23T22:38:00.000Z	tolpico	ZykoticK9	never hard about them, i will try them now, thanks
2009-12-23T22:49:00.000Z	tolpico	ZykoticK9	I installed conky through synaptic. Conky is not present in Applications menu anywhere. How can I run the app?
2009-12-23T22:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tolpico	try running it from a terminal -- FYI i don't use conky
2009-12-23T22:55:00.000Z	tolpico	ZykoticK9	about conky, its not present in edit menus. I tried running "conky" in terminal, it prints three lines, the last one being "Conky: drawing to single buffer". The process still running. Thanks, still finding other ways.
2009-12-23T22:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tolpico	sorry man i don't use conky so i have no idea
2009-12-23T22:57:00.000Z	tolpico	ZykoticK9	oh hey! it runs, alt f2 conky, thank you very much!! weird what hapenned when terminal. anyway thanks once again
2009-12-23T23:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tolpico	see http://paste.ubuntu.com/345469/ for nvidia settings fix
2009-12-23T23:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tolpico	sorry use http://paste.ubuntu.com/345474/ instead xorg.conf.backup can cause problems
2009-12-23T23:38:00.000Z	tolpico	ZykoticK9	i tried both, but it says the file doesnt exist, http://pastebin.com/m9131a8a
2009-12-23T23:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tolpico	you need to use "sudo nvidia-xconfig"
2009-12-23T23:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tolpico	also skip the "sudo mv xorg.conf xorg.conf.old" if you don't have an xorg.conf right now
2009-12-23T23:41:00.000Z	tolpico	ZykoticK9	oh thats what Flare183 was saying?, ok will try that now
2009-12-23T23:46:00.000Z	tolpico	ZykoticK9	thanks it saved. http://pastebin.com/m7a0ebdf4 just for understanding, in that text which one depicts the screen resoution? because I set it to 1152X... but those numbers arent present there
2009-12-23T23:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tolpico	screen resolution isn't in "your" xorg - did you save the changes after making the change?  Screen res is typically in the "Screen" section
2009-12-23T23:52:00.000Z	tolpico	ZykoticK9	yes that text file was the result of the commands you gave. now in nvidia when I try to save the setting it gives me preview of sorg.conf which contains 1152X... , but nvidia cant save it, No i am in a position with the text it hand but cant save it to it.
2009-12-23T23:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tolpico	are you using "sudo nvidia-settings" you need to in order to save changes
2009-12-23T23:54:00.000Z	tolpico	ZykoticK9	wow! thats done clean and perfect, thanks once again. so edits need to be done as super user. is there a mnnual where we can get the commands like "nvidia-settings"
2009-12-23T23:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tolpico	don't know of any Super manual sorry....  learn on a case by case basis i'm affraid
2009-12-23T23:56:00.000Z	tolpico	ZykoticK9	thank you very much, the support here at irc is encouraging me to learn more of ubuntu, Good day.
