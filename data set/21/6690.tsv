2007-05-29T15:50:00.000Z	emet		ok try this
2007-05-29T15:51:00.000Z	emet		ok just type "lspci" then
2007-05-29T15:51:00.000Z	emet		do this lspci | less
2007-05-29T15:51:00.000Z	emet		and look for anything related to a sound card
2007-05-29T15:52:00.000Z	emet		that is a list of all your computer's hardware (PCI)
2007-05-29T15:53:00.000Z	emet		nothing happened?
2007-05-29T15:53:00.000Z	emet		"| less" makes it easier to read a long list of things
2007-05-29T15:54:00.000Z	emet		it should say your sound card in lspci, if it does not it is a BUG in Ubuntu
2007-05-29T15:54:00.000Z	emet		the only sound card I know of that ISN'T supported in Ubuntu is Creative Labs new one
2007-05-29T15:55:00.000Z	emet		so anything else is a bug
2007-05-29T15:56:00.000Z	ttmrichter	emet	I've never had a sound card built into a laptop that was supported by Ubuntu.
2007-05-29T15:56:00.000Z	ttmrichter	emet	There's lots of sound cards unsupported by Ubuntu.
2007-05-29T15:57:00.000Z	emet		nt CrossX's card
2007-05-29T15:57:00.000Z	emet		it works
2007-05-29T15:57:00.000Z	emet	ttmrichter	the only one I know if is from CREATIVE LABS FX CARD
2007-05-29T15:58:00.000Z	ttmrichter	emet	Add any sound card in the Sony FX line and the SiS card on my current laptop then.
2007-05-29T15:58:00.000Z	ttmrichter	emet	In both those cases I had to use an external sound card to get sound.
2007-05-29T15:58:00.000Z	emet		well his card worked
2007-05-29T15:58:00.000Z	emet		in beta version of ubuntu
2007-05-29T15:58:00.000Z	emet		clearly it's supported
2007-05-29T15:59:00.000Z	ttmrichter	emet	Just because *YOU* haven't heard of cards that don't work doesn't mean they don't exist.
