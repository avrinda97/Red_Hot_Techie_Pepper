2008-10-28T19:19:00.000Z	skorasaurus		it was from my iBook, which suddenly died. it would boot up to even a livecd; after diagnosing the problem on several forums, it was a logic board problem
2008-10-28T19:20:00.000Z	skorasaurus		(i had experienced the exact symptoms 5 months earlier, and had the logic board replaced, this 2nd time around, my applecare had expired.
2008-10-28T19:21:00.000Z	skorasaurus		it was from a g4, ppc ibook (circa 2005)
2008-10-28T19:21:00.000Z	skorasaurus		I've did a bit of searching on it (on the ubuntu forums) and there is very little information on it.
2008-10-28T19:21:00.000Z	skorasaurus		it's still an hfs+ formatted hd
2008-10-28T19:22:00.000Z	skorasaurus		k
2008-10-28T19:22:00.000Z	skorasaurus		thank you ikonia
2008-10-28T19:22:00.000Z	musictoto	skorasaurus	is that hfs+ drive comming from your mac ?
2008-10-28T19:22:00.000Z	skorasaurus	musictoto	i removed the hard drive from the mac
2008-10-28T19:23:00.000Z	musictoto	skorasaurus	did you have Journaling enabled on that mac ?
2008-10-28T19:23:00.000Z	skorasaurus	musictoto	i'm not sure.
2008-10-28T19:24:00.000Z	musictoto	skorasaurus	because ubuntu can't read from hfs+ drives with journaling enabled... if it was enabled, you have to disable Journaling using a mac computer
2008-10-28T19:24:00.000Z	skorasaurus	musictoto	it was from a general consumer ibook g4, so i'm not sure if I had configured it or not.
2008-10-28T19:24:00.000Z	skorasaurus	musictoto	meh.
2008-10-28T19:25:00.000Z	musictoto	skorasaurus	i had the Journaling problem, there's only one way to solve it.
2008-10-28T19:25:00.000Z	musictoto	skorasaurus	but if it isn't that, i can't help you any further (my knowledge isn't big) :)
2008-10-28T19:25:00.000Z	skorasaurus	musictoto	which is to disable journaling in mac os x ?
2008-10-28T19:25:00.000Z	musictoto	skorasaurus	to disable journaling in mac osx, you must use 'diskutily'
2008-10-28T19:26:00.000Z	musictoto	skorasaurus	read here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2346494
2008-10-28T19:27:00.000Z	musictoto	skorasaurus	 i'm not sure if your problem is Journaling-related, but it could be if it's a hfs+ drive
2008-10-28T19:29:00.000Z	skorasaurus	musictoto	and ikonia: i'm not trying to write to the disk, just read it, so i can copy my data over to my ext3-formatted hd
