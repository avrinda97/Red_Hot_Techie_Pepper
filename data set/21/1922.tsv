2010-03-17T07:27:00.000Z	Spaztic_One		Is anyone here good at resolving sound issues? I've gone through guides and such, and I think that just complicated my issues.
2010-03-17T07:27:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Spaztic_One	clicking, pops, dropouts, static?
2010-03-17T07:34:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	LinuxGuy2009	Currently, no sound. It was working the other day, and I logged out, and when I logged back in, there was no sound. djuber: Desktop.
2010-03-17T07:44:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	LinuxGuy2009	Didn't you just spell it?
2010-03-17T07:44:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Spaztic_One	Point taken.
2010-03-17T08:05:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Spaztic_One	Whats up?
2010-03-17T08:06:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Spaztic_One	Have you tried removing pulseaudio to see if that fixes it up? Its pretty common for pulse to be buggy.
2010-03-17T08:07:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Spaztic_One	Ok so reinstall pulse and try that.
2010-03-17T08:08:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Spaztic_One	Could be a bug. Might have better luck with 9.04 or wait for 10.04 LTS?
2010-03-17T08:09:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	LinuxGuy2009	OK, how would I go about downgrading to Jaunty?
2010-03-17T08:10:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Spaztic_One	Backup your home and clean install.
2010-03-17T08:10:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	LinuxGuy2009	So I would need to make another CD?
2010-03-17T08:11:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Spaztic_One	If you dont already have one sure.
2010-03-17T08:13:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Spaztic_One	Uninstall it and reinstall it in Windows. I have no clue I stopped using Windows like 2 years ago.
2010-03-17T08:14:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	LinuxGuy2009	Yeah, I'm trying it out before I make the official move (or stay). So far, everything is great, except my audio. All the programs I want to keep run very well in WINE, and the others have equivalents for under the Linux Kernel.
2010-03-17T08:16:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	LinuxGuy2009	Oh, other reason for me to not change to Jaunty is that I would have to move my computer to a wired internet connection for it to fetch the updates to get my wireless NIC to work.
2010-03-17T08:16:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Spaztic_One	Well Im not forcing you into anything so its your call.
2010-03-17T08:17:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	LinuxGuy2009	Yes, I know. Do you have any other suggestions / advice for getting my audio working?
2010-03-17T08:18:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	LinuxGuy2009	Also, my computer doesn't appear to see my onboard audio...
2010-03-17T08:19:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	LinuxGuy2009	It did earlier, but not currently, and I switched to a different ouput, and its still not working.
2010-03-17T08:19:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Spaztic_One	sudo lshw -C sound
