2005-04-26T11:39:00.000Z	pimaniac	akk	i think hes seeing the camera input from the slot instead of his scanner
2005-04-26T11:39:00.000Z	pimaniac	akk	ill try asking for more
2005-04-26T11:40:00.000Z	akk	pimaniac	I think I had to modify a sane file under /etc/hotplug somewhere for my epson scanner.
2005-04-26T11:41:00.000Z	akk	pimaniac	sane-find-scanner is sometimes helpful.
2005-04-26T11:42:00.000Z	pimaniac	akk	so tell him to run that?
2005-04-26T11:42:00.000Z	akk	pimaniac	It's a start, anyway.
2005-04-26T11:42:00.000Z	akk	pimaniac	Unfortunately it's usually not very helpful about why it didn't find anything.
2005-04-26T11:44:00.000Z	pimaniac	akk	im telling him now :)
2005-04-26T11:45:00.000Z	pimaniac		this is fun...

2005-04-26T11:47:00.000Z	pimaniac		azz, how do you pick the source in xsane?
