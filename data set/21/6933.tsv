2007-01-09T16:44:00.000Z	phr34ck		Anjuta sucks.
2007-01-09T16:45:00.000Z	phr34ck		I never got it working correctly, specially when I choose "New project"
2007-01-09T16:46:00.000Z	phr34ck		now I got no C++/Java IDE ... I'm using gedit which is very hard since I have to work with multiple files in each project.
2007-01-09T16:47:00.000Z	phr34ck		I never got it work, specially when it comes to projects.
2007-01-09T16:48:00.000Z	phr34ck		It just gives loads of errors.
2007-01-09T16:49:00.000Z	yoshiznit123	phr34ck	although i think the language is a lot better, and  the class library is cleaner
2007-01-09T16:50:00.000Z	phr34ck	yoshiznit123	Java of course.
2007-01-09T16:50:00.000Z	yoshiznit123	phr34ck	C#, of course
2007-01-09T16:51:00.000Z	phr34ck	yoshiznit123	I wouldn't know about that since I never used C# and I never will. Just by knowing it's a rip of Java is enough for me for not using it.
2007-01-09T16:51:00.000Z	yoshiznit123	phr34ck	you really should, just because MS made it doesn't make it automatically bad - and Java was ripped off C++
2007-01-09T16:52:00.000Z	phr34ck	yoshiznit123	and now you have no idea what you're talking about. Java is WRITTEN in C++.
2007-01-09T16:52:00.000Z	yoshiznit123	phr34ck	yea but the syntax and similar is in that same family :-)
2007-01-09T16:54:00.000Z	phr34ck	yoshiznit123	you have to understand that Java is "Written" in C++.
2007-01-09T16:54:00.000Z	phr34ck	yoshiznit123	do you even know that Java Native Code is ?
2007-01-09T16:55:00.000Z	yoshiznit123	phr34ck	of course. i'm just saying the language itself is similar. also, i find java kinda weird, 3 different ways to get lengths of strings and arrays?
2007-01-09T16:55:00.000Z	phr34ck	yoshiznit123	and that is weird for you?
2007-01-09T16:55:00.000Z	yoshiznit123	phr34ck	yea there should only be one obvious way to do it :-)
2007-01-09T16:56:00.000Z	phr34ck	yoshiznit123	I pitty you if you're a programmer./
2007-01-09T16:57:00.000Z	yoshiznit123	phr34ck	have you ever tried python or boo?
2007-01-09T16:57:00.000Z	phr34ck	yoshiznit123	I'm familiar with python, but never really tried it.
2007-01-09T16:58:00.000Z	phr34ck	yoshiznit123	in Assembly you can make a pointer to a specific bit ... imagine that.
