2005-02-17T16:19:00.000Z	Xappe		hmm, installed graveman on hoary with apt-get source -b and dkpg to enable the mp3 support. now when I run synaptic it wants to upgrade graveman although the version is the same...why what how?
2005-02-17T16:21:00.000Z	topyli	Xappe	just hold the package ("pin" in synaptic IIRC)
2005-02-17T16:21:00.000Z	topyli	Xappe	seems to be "lock" in synaptic
2005-02-17T16:22:00.000Z	Xappe	topyli	mkay...i'll try that.
2005-02-17T16:23:00.000Z	topyli	Xappe	happened to me with gaim :)
2005-02-17T16:24:00.000Z	topyli	Xappe	the package in the repository probably has an "epoch" or whatever it's called, like version 1:1.1.1 while you just have 1.1.1
2005-02-17T16:27:00.000Z	Xappe	topyli	but the lock function does not seem to work. it unlocks it when I choose smart upgrade...
2005-02-17T16:30:00.000Z	topyli	Xappe	strange
2005-02-17T16:30:00.000Z	Xappe	topyli	yes
2005-02-17T16:31:00.000Z	topyli	Xappe	nothing should depend on graveman so why would it matter to any upgrade?
2005-02-17T16:32:00.000Z	Xappe	topyli	I don't know. installed all build-deps and install deps before dkpg -i
2005-02-17T16:33:00.000Z	Xappe	topyli	and afaik the existing binary in the repos does not have mp3 support
2005-02-17T16:33:00.000Z	topyli	Xappe	yeah, and even if you missed a graveman dependancy, it would simply be broken. but nothing depends on graveman :\
2005-02-17T16:36:00.000Z	topyli	Xappe	yeah, i'm clueless
2005-02-18T07:15:00.000Z	topyli	Xappe	still fighting eh? I'd just build another package and give it version number 8.2 :)
2005-03-05T10:16:00.000Z	Xappe	topyli	and I want worms 3d to work with linux
2005-03-05T10:18:00.000Z	topyli	Xappe	i wonder why there's no decent worms clone for linux. atomic tanks doesn't quite cut it yet :)
2005-03-05T10:19:00.000Z	topyli	Xappe	better than nothing! what are you referring to?
2005-03-05T10:20:00.000Z	Xappe	topyli	hmm...cant recall the name right now, but it lurched in the repos somewhere
2005-04-09T14:50:00.000Z	Xappe	topyli	well, lynx for the web and irssi for irc :)
2005-04-09T14:50:00.000Z	topyli	Xappe	sure. mutt and abook. when for scheduling, note for database and so on :)
