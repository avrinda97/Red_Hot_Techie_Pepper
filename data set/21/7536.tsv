2006-10-11T16:53:00.000Z	XenThraL		eh, I need help if anyone is willing
2006-10-11T16:54:00.000Z	XenThraL		"Hi, I'm having troubles configuring which sound device to use in KDE -- its quite frustrating, tried just about everything"
2006-10-11T16:54:00.000Z	XenThraL		not only the sound device orders keep changing
2006-10-11T16:54:00.000Z	XenThraL		but the 'default' one also changes
2006-10-11T16:54:00.000Z	XenThraL		tried to do a fix for it I found on the forums, but it didn't 'take' apparently
2006-10-11T16:55:00.000Z	XenThraL		Uh?
2006-10-11T16:55:00.000Z	XenThraL		no I went as root
2006-10-11T16:55:00.000Z	XenThraL		if root can't change it then, well, I'm pretty sure I'm screwed
2006-10-11T16:56:00.000Z	XenThraL		lol
2006-10-11T16:56:00.000Z	XenThraL		I think the fix didn't work rather then me writing it
2006-10-11T16:56:00.000Z	variant	XenThraL	you can setup a udev rule that will tell it exactly where to be :)
2006-10-11T16:57:00.000Z	variant	XenThraL	you are having the soundcard issue right?
2006-10-11T16:57:00.000Z	variant	XenThraL	you have more than one soundcard?
2006-10-11T05:05:00.000Z	variant	XenThraL	sorry aboutthat.. ssh dissconeccted me
2006-10-11T05:05:00.000Z	variant	XenThraL	you can setup a udev rule that will always assign the same deivce to the same name
2006-10-11T05:06:00.000Z	variant	XenThraL	take a look at /etc/udev/rules.d/20-names.rules
2006-10-11T05:08:00.000Z	variant	XenThraL	you see the different rules there?
2006-10-11T05:08:00.000Z	variant	XenThraL	its not far in
2006-10-11T05:09:00.000Z	XenThraL	variant	kromel found a forum link detailing exactly what I'm looking to do
2006-10-11T05:10:00.000Z	variant	XenThraL	cool, best do that way then :)
2006-10-11T05:30:00.000Z	XenThraL	variant	eh, the link I tried didn't really help, could you help me set up the udev rule ?
