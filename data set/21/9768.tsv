2006-01-13T09:44:00.000Z	rickard		How do I unzip *.rar files in Linux?
2006-01-13T09:45:00.000Z	brenner	rickard	you don't unzip, you unrar ... with unrar. :)
2006-01-13T09:50:00.000Z	brenner	rickard	you need to enable the multiverse repo
2006-01-13T09:59:00.000Z	brenner	rickard	it means you still haven't enabled multiverse
2006-01-13T09:59:00.000Z	rickard	brenner	how do I enable multiverse?
2006-01-13T09:59:00.000Z	brenner	rickard	check your pms
2006-01-13T10:01:00.000Z	rickard	brenner	I've done that
2006-01-13T10:02:00.000Z	brenner	rickard	did you reload/update?
2006-01-13T10:02:00.000Z	rickard	brenner	yea
2006-01-13T10:03:00.000Z	brenner	rickard	paste the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list to a pastebin
2006-01-13T10:05:00.000Z	rickard	brenner	ok.. but what is a pastebin?
2006-01-13T10:06:00.000Z	rickard	brenner	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6808
2006-01-13T10:09:00.000Z	brenner	rickard	sorry my firefox seems to be acting up.  could someone check out his sources.list? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6808  he's trying to enable multiverse to get unrar-nonfree
2006-01-13T10:13:00.000Z	rickard	brenner	what is supposed to be written in sources.list?
2006-01-13T10:13:00.000Z	brenner	rickard	looks like it's missing ... replace the contents with this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047
2006-01-13T10:13:00.000Z	brenner	rickard	you can do that with: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-01-13T10:14:00.000Z	brenner	rickard	save and close, then sudo apt-get update
2006-01-13T10:14:00.000Z	rickard	brenner	ok
2006-01-13T10:25:00.000Z	brenner	rickard	how's it going?
2006-01-13T10:26:00.000Z	rickard	brenner	- it worked all fine :)
2006-01-13T10:27:00.000Z	brenner	rickard	nice.  you've set up your repos now, so you hopefully won't complain about not finding stuff again. :D
