2011-11-04T19:09:00.000Z	lauratika		fuck this im reinstalling i hate ubuntu 11.10 so badly
2011-11-04T19:10:00.000Z	lauratika		im stuck cant change thmes, fonts, keyboard controls wont work (volume, lockscreen)
2011-11-04T19:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	lauratika	reinstalling an old version of ubuntu doesn't make sense (you'll have to update eventually) - if you hate Unity try another distro
2011-11-04T19:13:00.000Z	zykotick9	lauratika	sorry, my bad (when people make outbursts like that, it's usually Unity)
2012-06-01T02:24:00.000Z	zykotick9	lauratika	chromium != chrome
2012-06-01T02:25:00.000Z	zykotick9	lauratika	but chrome still has all the spying, if that's what you want
2012-06-01T02:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	lauratika	chromium gets features (except spying) before chrome actually...
2012-06-01T02:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	lauratika	chrome is based off of chromium source
2012-06-01T02:29:00.000Z	zykotick9	lauratika	you are on freenode now...
2012-06-01T02:29:00.000Z	lauratika	zykotick9	yes but im using operas chat,but seems im moving out as facebook want to buy it so looking for alternatives
2012-06-01T02:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	lauratika	i'd recommend using an IRC client for IRC channels... but that's perhaps just me
2012-06-01T02:31:00.000Z	zykotick9	lauratika	include the NIC of the person you are talking to
2012-06-01T02:32:00.000Z	zykotick9	lauratika	that worked on my side
2012-06-01T02:32:00.000Z	lauratika	zykotick9	thanx
2012-06-01T02:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	lauratika	if you want to help Google then use chromium, if you want to help the internet use firefox ;)
2012-06-01T02:34:00.000Z	lauratika	zykotick9	i been using opera for a looong time and its so hard to move to firefox i may need group support  sesssions for the move  :(  :o  :D
2012-06-01T02:35:00.000Z	zykotick9	lauratika	opera is even worse then chromium... non-free software
2012-06-01T02:35:00.000Z	lauratika	zykotick9	but i hear you...
2012-06-01T02:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	lauratika	i'm not the biggest firefox fan, but i use it and uzbl and elinks2 - depending on situtation
2012-06-01T02:36:00.000Z	lauratika	zykotick9	this is not an opera channel but you can judge a software by it's open source always.opera is a full suite more than a browser and i've been using it way before firefox even came out
2012-06-01T02:38:00.000Z	lauratika	zykotick9	and  it will be time to move from opera and i wonder now that ubuntu move to chromium how safe it is and how good i will give it a try i guess
