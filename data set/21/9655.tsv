2005-12-15T12:27:00.000Z	ClayG		how can I get my computers to stop changin private ip's ?I made entries in the my /etc/hosts file adding ip addies and the corresponding hosts but this doesn't seem to stop them from changing.
2005-12-15T12:27:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	ClayG	you can use static IP's
2005-12-15T12:28:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	ClayG	in the Networking applet - change DHCP to Static
2005-12-15T12:28:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	ClayG	 on your machine.
2005-12-15T12:28:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	ClayG	your router gets one IP from the ISP . You can leave that end alone.
2005-12-15T12:29:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	ClayG	 i have my network set up with static ips
2005-12-15T12:29:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	ClayG	 what desktop are you using, Gnome?
2005-12-15T12:30:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	ClayG	System> Admin > Networking
2005-12-15T12:30:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	ClayG	  okee, then click the interface (you prob only have one) click properties
2005-12-15T12:31:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	ClayG	then click on DHCP , change to Static, and enter an IP - something like 192.168.0.110
2005-12-15T12:32:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	ClayG	yup!
2005-12-15T12:32:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	ClayG	 then Gateway is the ip of your router. Mine is 192.168.0.1
2005-12-15T12:33:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	ClayG	 oh ok. You can always ping to see if it worked
2005-12-15T12:34:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	ClayG	does what automatically? the IPs?
