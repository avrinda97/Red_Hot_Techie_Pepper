2010-05-24T22:54:00.000Z	dipu_	ubuntunewbie	: swap will not show in filesystem
2010-05-24T22:55:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	dipu_	what do you mean ?
2010-05-24T22:56:00.000Z	dipu_	ubuntunewbie	: swap is not filesystem where you can store files ..its extension of memory ..used bu OS
2010-05-24T22:56:00.000Z	dipu_	ubuntunewbie	: used by** OS
2010-05-24T22:57:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	dipu_	there's no swap file on this new ubuntu 10.04 installed
2010-05-24T22:58:00.000Z	dipu_	ubuntunewbie	: u mean you did not create swap partition while installing ubuntu ?
2010-05-24T23:00:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	dipu_	while installing it create a swap partition but i had another ubuntu version install.So it take up 2 of the swap.But when I check at system monitor under file system tab it doesn't show the swap partition at all and my swap partition usage is 0 bytes
2010-05-24T23:00:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	dipu_	quite confusing ,
2010-05-24T23:01:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	dipu_	making it simple , it shows 7.6GB swap , and 0 byte use which mean it doesn't even use the swap i created
2010-05-24T23:01:00.000Z	dipu_	ubuntunewbie	: yes ... normally it will only use swap when RAM is full
2010-05-24T23:02:00.000Z	dipu_	ubuntunewbie	: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq
2010-05-24T23:03:00.000Z	dipu_	ubuntunewbie	: for a pc 7.6 GB swap seems too much to me
2010-05-24T23:08:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	dipu_	 aeon-ltd: 2GB , I assign 4GB of swap memory.The problem is I had another hard disk install with ubuntu 8.04 with same 4GB.I created another swap for ubuntu 10.04.Don't know what happen to the installation it auto assign both swap partition messing up mow
2010-05-24T23:10:00.000Z	dipu_	ubuntunewbie	:I believe u can use same swap partition will all linux systems ... need not create a new one for installation
2010-05-24T23:12:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	dipu_	 , that's the one which I dont know
