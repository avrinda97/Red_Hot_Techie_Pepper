2005-02-09T12:44:00.000Z	ExxonE		When I'm going to download with bittorent i get the following error: "ERROR: Could not load wxPython. In order to use this script, you must have wxPython installed. It is avaiable in the package libwxgtk2.3-python." but i can't find the package, anyone who have a bunch of good sources?
2005-02-09T12:45:00.000Z	popey	ExxonE	use btdownloadcurses instead?
2005-02-09T12:45:00.000Z	popey	ExxonE	it's popey, not popeye, it's a curses (text) based bit torrent client
2005-02-09T12:46:00.000Z	ExxonE	popey	ok.
2005-02-09T12:48:00.000Z	popey	ExxonE	you should already have btdownloadcurses, it comes with bittorrent
2005-02-09T12:49:00.000Z	ExxonE	popey	but I am so f**king bad in text-based prgms..
2005-02-09T12:49:00.000Z	popey	ExxonE	you don't need to be any "good" at anything.. you just run it with one parameter, the torrent file, job done
2005-02-09T12:51:00.000Z	ExxonE	popey	also, saving the torrentfile on disk, after that take it from console?
2005-02-09T12:51:00.000Z	popey	ExxonE	no, use nautilus
2005-02-09T12:54:00.000Z	ExxonE	popey	1. fetching the *.torrent 2: open with nautilus choosing to open with what?
2005-02-09T12:54:00.000Z	popey	ExxonE	download torrent, open terminal, cd to directory containing torrent, type bitdownloadcurses <torrentfilename>
2005-02-09T12:55:00.000Z	ExxonE	popey	allright! thanx! :D
