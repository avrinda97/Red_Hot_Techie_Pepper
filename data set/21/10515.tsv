2005-02-12T09:33:00.000Z	jeld		can anyone help me configure my sudoers?
2005-02-12T09:33:00.000Z	deshantm	jeld	edit /etc/sudoers
2005-02-12T09:33:00.000Z	jeld	deshantm	I have a particular problem, I am trying to add a program to start without a password
2005-02-12T09:34:00.000Z	jeld	deshantm	after I added a line with NOPASSWD: I am now never prompted for password
2005-02-12T09:34:00.000Z	jeld	deshantm	for any command
2005-02-12T09:34:00.000Z	deshantm	jeld	wow that's kinda cool but assuming not what you want?
2005-02-12T09:35:00.000Z	jeld	deshantm	the line reads myuser ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/firestarter
2005-02-12T09:35:00.000Z	deshantm	jeld	what are you trying to do?
2005-02-12T09:35:00.000Z	jeld	deshantm	I only want firestarter not to ask for password
2005-02-12T09:36:00.000Z	deshantm	jeld	oh i have never done that...
2005-02-12T09:36:00.000Z	jeld	deshantm	I am not very familiar with sudo and the man page on sudoers is kinda confusing :)

2005-02-12T09:44:00.000Z	deshantm	jeld	best link i have found so far
2005-02-12T09:45:00.000Z	jeld	deshantm	let me try, but this sounds exactly as what I am doing
2005-02-12T09:45:00.000Z	deshantm	jeld	this one too http://www.essenz.com/support/comp.unix.admin/Aug/27/110847.html
2005-02-12T09:45:00.000Z	deshantm	jeld	good luck
2005-02-12T09:48:00.000Z	jeld	deshantm	got it, the sudo cache was tricking me
2005-02-12T09:49:00.000Z	jeld	deshantm	this is a bit strange though
2005-02-12T09:51:00.000Z	jeld	deshantm	try this for fun: 1. open a new gnome terminal 2. sudo visudo <enter password> 3. close the terminal 4. open a new one and try the command again. It will not ask you for a password. I know that sudo remembers authentication info for some time, but I kinda figured that if I close the terminal it would forget that info. Looks that it goes by terminal device to differentiate between sessions
2005-02-12T09:52:00.000Z	jeld	deshantm	thanx
2005-02-12T09:56:00.000Z	deshantm	jeld	cool glad you got it i will try what you said
