2004-11-07T11:23:00.000Z	altan		oddabe did you try deleting non-MP3 files?
2004-11-07T11:23:00.000Z	altan		I think that might be the problem
2004-11-07T11:24:00.000Z	altan		what's the option to delete items in subfolders too with rm? -R?
2004-11-07T11:26:00.000Z	altan		oddabe19> altan, rm -r <--- doesn't see them
2004-11-07T11:26:00.000Z	altan		with rm -r *.jpg
2004-11-07T11:26:00.000Z	altan		ok
2004-11-07T11:28:00.000Z	altan		still not working, will spaces in the directory names do that?
2004-11-07T11:29:00.000Z	bob2	altan	rm -r dirname
2004-11-07T11:29:00.000Z	bob2	altan	that will get rid of everything in dirname
2004-11-07T11:37:00.000Z	bob2	altan	erm, of course
2004-11-07T11:37:00.000Z	bob2	altan	rm -r "whatever blah blah"
2004-11-07T11:37:00.000Z	altan	bob2	it's about 40 spaced directiies with more spaced directories in each of them
2004-11-07T11:37:00.000Z	bob2	altan	"didn't work"?
2004-11-07T11:37:00.000Z	bob2	altan	define that
2004-11-07T11:38:00.000Z	bob2	altan	since "rm *" gets dirs with spaces for me
2004-11-07T11:40:00.000Z	bob2	altan	yes, but your *shell* expands *.jpg, not rm
2004-11-07T11:40:00.000Z	bob2	altan	you want something like: find -name "*.jpg" -type f
2004-11-07T11:41:00.000Z	bob2	altan	which will print out all the files (type f) whose names match "*.jpg" (-name)
2004-11-08T10:06:00.000Z	bob2	altan	try a different one, but archive.ubuntu.com has ungodly amounts of bandwidth
2004-11-08T10:08:00.000Z	altan	bob2	nope, I'm using universe archive.ubuntu.com and getting 300-800 _bytes_ per second
2004-12-20T15:46:00.000Z	bob2	altan	you need to do it on /dev/hdc
