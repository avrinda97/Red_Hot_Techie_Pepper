2008-05-05T21:28:00.000Z	CShadowRun		getting graphics drivers to work != simple?
2008-05-05T21:28:00.000Z	CShadowRun		getting screens to maximize properly isn't simple either?
2008-05-05T21:28:00.000Z	CShadowRun		omg -_-
2008-05-05T21:28:00.000Z	CShadowRun		i used to have an ati and i had issues with that
2008-05-05T21:29:00.000Z	CShadowRun		and everyone in here told me to get an nvidia
2008-05-05T21:29:00.000Z	CShadowRun		now i have an nvidia you are whining about that too
2008-05-05T21:30:00.000Z	CShadowRun		heh
2008-05-05T21:30:00.000Z	CShadowRun		so why did people tell me to get an nvidia then?
2008-05-05T21:30:00.000Z	CShadowRun		well it's apparently not working :p
2008-05-05T21:31:00.000Z	CShadowRun		not being able to maximize a window is pretty annoying :p
2008-05-05T21:31:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	CShadowRun	nvidia works fine for me, perhaps there is a config issue? did you pastebin your xorg.conf? i missed the link if you did
2008-05-05T21:31:00.000Z	CShadowRun	ushimitsudoki	i'll paste it now.

2008-05-05T21:33:00.000Z	CShadowRun	ushimitsudoki	http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=15389 linking it again incase the netsplit made you miss it :p
2008-05-05T21:33:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	CShadowRun	I am looking at it now
2008-05-05T21:35:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	CShadowRun	This is the latest xorg.conf as generated by nvidia-settings? No hand-changes?
2008-05-05T21:40:00.000Z	CShadowRun	ushimitsudoki	any idea?
2008-05-05T21:40:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	CShadowRun	Here are my two suggestions: 1. Drop into a terminal, re=install the drivers and try the xorg.conf that the process will generate.
2008-05-05T21:40:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	CShadowRun	heck out my xorg.conf here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/10278/ and make similar changes
2008-05-05T21:41:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	CShadowRun	but keep in mind i am running 2 cards on 3 montiors
2008-05-05T21:41:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	CShadowRun	so don't just copy mine exactly
