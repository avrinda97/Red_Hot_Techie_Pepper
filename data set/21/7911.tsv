2008-09-10T03:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dashnu	what res are you trying to push on there
2008-09-10T03:52:00.000Z	dashnu	Jack_Sparrow	usually 800x600
2008-09-10T03:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dashnu	you are probably using more than 14 colors
2008-09-10T03:55:00.000Z	dashnu	Jack_Sparrow	how do I address that?
2008-09-10T03:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dashnu	reduce the number of colorsa in your image
2008-09-10T03:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dashnu	Use Gimp, Use Image, Scale Image and Reduce to 640 x 480 then using tools, color tools, posterize,, set to 14 colors,m save as xmp, archive with gz...
