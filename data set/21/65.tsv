2012-10-17T11:06:00.000Z	martimus		hey all, how might i go about changing my default file manager? im on a pretty standard setup of 12.04. the desktop can even stay nautilus, that doesnt matter.
2012-10-17T11:07:00.000Z	rinzler	martimus	in settings manager, choose preferred applications
2012-10-17T11:07:00.000Z	rinzler	martimus	there's an option for file manager. Came up on this myself.
2012-10-17T11:09:00.000Z	martimus	rinzler	i dont see an option for file manager
2012-10-17T11:09:00.000Z	rinzler	martimus	hmm... one sec...
2012-10-17T11:10:00.000Z	rinzler	martimus	under the utilities tab?
2012-10-17T11:13:00.000Z	martimus	rinzler	im not seeing an app called settings manager, or any tab called utilities in system settings :/
2012-10-17T11:16:00.000Z	rinzler	martimus	use the search bar to search for "settings manager". In there, you should see an icon that is labeled "Preferred Applications" and you should see an option for file manager under the utilities tab
2012-10-17T11:18:00.000Z	martimus	rinzler	^
2012-10-17T11:19:00.000Z	rinzler	martimus	hmm... that worked for me... Have you all your updates? (also was going to ask for mentions :P )
2012-10-17T11:20:00.000Z	martimus	rinzler	i think im up to date on everything (and yeah, i havent been on irc more than a couple times in the last few years, ive been forgetting :P)
2012-10-17T11:21:00.000Z	martimus	rinzler	is there a command i can type in to auto-update everything?
2012-10-17T11:21:00.000Z	rinzler	martimus	run "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade" in a terminal to make sure. If there are any significant updates, it'll ask you to confirm
2012-10-17T11:23:00.000Z	martimus	rinzler	i got a whole bunch of warnings like "W: Failed to fetch https://private-ppa.launchpad.net/commercial-ppa-uploaders/wizorb/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/binary-i386/Packages  The requested URL returned error: 401
2012-10-17T11:24:00.000Z	rinzler	martimus	assuming you're connected to teh internetz run just "sudo apt-get upgrade"
2012-10-17T11:40:00.000Z	martimus	rinzler	a good deal more searching (this time looking through the ubuntu forums page by page instead of using any actual search terms...) found me this: sudo apt-get install exo-utils, then exo-preferred-applications... and that opens the thing you were referring to
2012-10-17T11:41:00.000Z	rinzler	martimus	Heh. never came across that *scratches head* Glad you're all set, though!
2012-10-17T11:41:00.000Z	martimus	rinzler	that said, using it doesnt seem to have worked. crap.
2012-10-17T11:44:00.000Z	rinzler	martimus	well, shucks.
2012-10-17T11:46:00.000Z	martimus	rinzler	ah well. i appreciate the help. i'll try again another time when i'm *not* desperate for sleep due to it being 2:45am. 'night
2012-10-17T11:46:00.000Z	rinzler	martimus	well, then. I'm out of my element on that one :P I use a different environment than the one that is default installed, so I wouldn't be able to help very well :P Night!
