2007-07-19T15:47:00.000Z	Marlene		im sure its just your standard network easy ethernet card
2007-07-19T15:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Marlene	In order to help us help you, we need to know as much as possible about your hardware, wired, wireless, cable, dsl, router, version of ubuntu..
2007-07-19T15:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Marlene	There is no such thing
2007-07-19T15:49:00.000Z	Marlene		aight i have a cisco bridge going to a smc router then i have a cable coming out of the router to the machine
2007-07-19T15:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Marlene	Sorry, not trying to be cute or curt...
2007-07-19T15:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Marlene	Great start, we have a wired system
2007-07-19T15:49:00.000Z	Marlene		my other machine with ms vista are working
2007-07-19T15:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Marlene	Is it internal on a desktop, pcmcia on a laptop, usb off a port..?
2007-07-19T15:50:00.000Z	Marlene		off a port on a desktop
2007-07-19T15:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Marlene	So it is a usb network adapter...  so it should be easy to find out the make and model..
2007-07-19T15:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Marlene	It will probably end up being a broadcom BCM43xx chipset but we still need to check
2007-07-19T15:53:00.000Z	Marlene		aight well like i said im not at my machine, just to clairify i have to manually set the network up, because i know they are taking to eack other the activity light is working
