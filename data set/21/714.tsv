2011-07-17T01:08:00.000Z	wildbat	crunchy_	if you have spare drives ~ clone it first ~
2011-07-17T01:09:00.000Z	crunchy_		I am really appreciating the help here... I have not used irc since like '98... glad people are still on it.
2011-07-17T01:09:00.000Z	crunchy_		I dont really have one at the moment, but i will try to find one perhaps
2011-07-17T01:10:00.000Z	crunchy_		will testdisk ruin my drive by any chance
2011-07-17T01:12:00.000Z	wildbat	crunchy_	may be but chance are slim ~ it is decide for restore deleted partition. always backup if you can
2011-07-17T01:13:00.000Z	crunchy_	wildbat	i will read about it more online.  just one more question for now.  I notice that my irc icon flashes when you message me. is that becuase you used my name in the message field
2011-07-17T01:15:00.000Z	wildbat	crunchy_	yes
2011-07-17T01:15:00.000Z	crunchy_	wildbat	thanks!
