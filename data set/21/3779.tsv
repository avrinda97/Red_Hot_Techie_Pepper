2008-11-12T18:45:00.000Z	mick02		Hey folks, how can I search the contents of files in a folder for a certain word? I've a folder with about 700 documents in it and I'm looking to find an email address within those files
2008-11-12T18:45:00.000Z	jrib	mick02	plaintext?
2008-11-12T18:46:00.000Z	jrib	mick02	grep -R WORD DIRECTORY
2008-11-12T18:58:00.000Z	mick02	jrib	is there a way to grep through a samba share on a windows PC?
2008-11-12T18:59:00.000Z	jrib	mick02	I don't know.  I suppose if you mount it somewhere it should work
2009-01-28T17:47:00.000Z	jrib	mick02	best to just ask the channel your question.  If someone knows the answer, they will try to help you
2009-01-28T17:48:00.000Z	mick02	jrib	I've asked but no one can help me it seems
2009-01-28T17:48:00.000Z	jrib	mick02	right, so that means no one that read your question, knows the answer.  Try the forums and mailing list while you wait and then repeat your question in 10 minutes or so for the new eyeballs
2009-01-28T17:49:00.000Z	mick02	jrib	this was my last hope, I've already been around the Ubuntu forums, linuxquestions.org and all that but nothing, not to worry I'll plug away and see if I can sort it myself
2009-01-28T17:50:00.000Z	jrib	mick02	I'm merely telling you, that you should repeat your question later instead of saying "can anyone help me?" since people who just read "can anyone help me?" have no idea what you are talking about
2009-01-28T17:51:00.000Z	jrib	mick02	repeating the question would do the same thing
2009-01-28T17:53:00.000Z	mick02	jrib	well I got a response from a few people by asking if no one could help me, I got no reply when I posted the question so I guess one method didn't get the same response as the other therefore they aren't the same thing
2009-01-28T17:54:00.000Z	jrib	mick02	right, one is frowned upon, the other one isn't.  I don't think we need to discuss this anymore
2009-01-28T17:55:00.000Z	mick02	jrib	I would have left it, you wanted to discuss it. Thanks anyway
2009-02-13T17:37:00.000Z	jrib	mick02	reboot into recovery mode and reset the password
2009-02-23T19:38:00.000Z	jrib	mick02	"grep for 2 patterns" is ambiguous
2009-02-23T19:39:00.000Z	mick02	jrib	in this case it is something that I would need to do as all the lines that I'm looking for will have both patterns in the output
2009-02-23T19:39:00.000Z	jrib	mick02	grep A | grep B
2009-02-23T19:41:00.000Z	mick02	jrib	can I use both the greps in one after another, if I do will I just be passing a result like http://pastebin.com/f78b93446
2009-02-23T19:42:00.000Z	jrib	mick02	well you use them how I said... COMMAND | grep A | grep B
