2010-09-11T20:49:00.000Z	kronosphere		didn't anyone else have trouble with their Fn key not working?
2010-09-11T20:50:00.000Z	kronosphere		so everyone's Fn key is working properly?
2010-09-11T20:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kronosphere	 on my laptops. yes. they all have worked. (on the 4 ive had over the last few years)
2010-09-11T20:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kronosphere	 some laptops and wireless cards are very quirky. is that the ONLY fn key thats 'not working' ?
2010-09-11T20:54:00.000Z	kronosphere	Dr_Willis	smart~ The Fn Key is working with the screen brightness F7 and F8 keys
2010-09-11T22:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kronosphere	 or holding the paper up the the monitor tryign to 'scan' it.
2010-09-11T22:37:00.000Z	kronosphere	Dr_Willis	was that a bot (ubottu) that automatically put the pastebin info out?
2010-09-11T22:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kronosphere	 yes.
2010-09-11T22:41:00.000Z	kronosphere	Dr_Willis	what is the easy way to pastebin right from the terminal? I didn't understand how you would indicate which command lines to paste.
2010-09-11T22:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kronosphere	 use the 'pastebinit' command.
2010-09-11T22:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kronosphere	 pastebinit foobar.c
2010-09-12T16:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kronosphere	 i doubt if you can
2010-09-12T16:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kronosphere	 silverlight/moonlight is so new - and not common - that it may not work properly
2010-09-12T16:39:00.000Z	kronosphere	Dr_Willis	i think it is that they have many courses available for free, not just computer science, and they use whatever format they use for all of it
2010-09-12T18:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kronosphere	 i recall they get mounted soem where - check mount command and see whats in /media/
2010-09-12T19:03:00.000Z	kronosphere	Dr_Willis	i am not seeing host or media anywhere
2010-09-12T19:22:00.000Z	kronosphere	Dr_Willis	Katsumi32 : that was the solution, I just checked folders and paths until I found it, but you might want to keep that, if there is a place where all the solutions get stored?
2010-09-12T19:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kronosphere	 i have no issues finding my windows files... :)
2010-09-12T19:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kronosphere	 also that depends on the windows version to the actual path
2010-09-12T19:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kronosphere	 or check the forums first...
2010-09-12T19:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kronosphere	 and thers the ubuntu manual
