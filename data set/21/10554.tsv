2005-02-09T13:45:00.000Z	hou5ton		:-)
2005-02-09T13:45:00.000Z	farruinn	hou5ton	add this to your sources.list: deb http://ubuntu-bp.sourceforge.net/ubuntu/ warty-backports main universe
2005-02-09T13:49:00.000Z	farruinn	hou5ton	just to be sure you do'nt miss what crimsun said, backports can cause serious problems when upgrading to hoary, so you'll have to remove any installed backports
2005-02-09T13:50:00.000Z	farruinn	hou5ton	hoary will be frozen in april
2005-03-27T07:25:00.000Z	farruinn	hou5ton	you need to delete your backports line if you're upgrading - there is no backports for hoary [yet] 
2005-03-27T07:25:00.000Z	farruinn	hou5ton	that too
2005-03-27T07:25:00.000Z	hou5ton	farruinn	  ok ...
2005-03-27T07:28:00.000Z	farruinn	hou5ton	it depends on how you do your versioning
2005-03-27T07:29:00.000Z	hou5ton	farruinn	  I'm assuming Hoary has all the latest versions of apps
2005-03-27T07:29:00.000Z	farruinn	hou5ton	as new as you're going to get for Ubuntu
2005-03-27T07:57:00.000Z	farruinn	hou5ton	and get rid of the backports line
2005-03-27T09:44:00.000Z	hou5ton	farruinn	  ok ... got that hoary running. ....
2005-03-27T09:45:00.000Z	farruinn	hou5ton	awesome, everything working alright?
2005-03-27T09:46:00.000Z	hou5ton	farruinn	  where is grub .. ?  boot/grub/grub.conf?
2005-03-27T09:48:00.000Z	farruinn	hou5ton	I don't know offhand, I don't have a pc.  Do a sudo updatedb then a search
2005-03-27T09:48:00.000Z	farruinn	hou5ton	dpkg -L [package]  will always tell you what files are installed by a package
2005-03-27T09:57:00.000Z	farruinn	hou5ton	you have ubuntu-desktop installed?
2005-03-27T09:58:00.000Z	hou5ton	farruinn	  ya .. everything else seems to be here and working
2005-03-27T11:13:00.000Z	farruinn	hou5ton	make sure xchat is using esd?
