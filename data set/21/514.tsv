2011-10-31T14:18:00.000Z	KiwiK		Hey Guuys anyone there?
2011-10-31T14:18:00.000Z	ikonia	KiwiK	many of us
2011-10-31T14:18:00.000Z	KiwiK	ikonia	may i chat with you privately?
2011-10-31T14:19:00.000Z	ikonia	KiwiK	why ?
2011-10-31T14:19:00.000Z	KiwiK	ikonia	because i think the problem is a bit complicated
2011-10-31T14:19:00.000Z	ikonia	KiwiK	just ask the channel, then many people can help if it's complexs
2011-10-31T14:22:00.000Z	KiwiK	ikonia	Any idea?
2011-10-31T14:22:00.000Z	ikonia	KiwiK	maybe a bug in the applet
2011-10-31T14:22:00.000Z	ikonia	KiwiK	maybe worth someone else testing it too
2011-10-31T14:23:00.000Z	KiwiK	ikonia	U know how i can reset the applet?
2011-10-31T14:23:00.000Z	ikonia	KiwiK	no idea
2011-10-31T14:23:00.000Z	ikonia	KiwiK	remove it and re-add it
2011-10-31T14:23:00.000Z	ikonia	KiwiK	ok, so see if you can get someone else to test it by adding the applet
2011-10-31T14:25:00.000Z	KiwiK	ikonia	But if i delete it and readd it it doesnt make any space untill i restart.
2011-10-31T14:26:00.000Z	ikonia	KiwiK	ok, that sounds like a bug with the applet
2011-10-31T14:26:00.000Z	ikonia	KiwiK	or the rendering engine and how it deals with that applet
2011-10-31T14:27:00.000Z	ikonia	KiwiK	no - why are you not listening to what I'm saying
2011-10-31T14:27:00.000Z	ikonia	KiwiK	it's probably a bug - see if you can get someone else to test it and verify it behaves the same/different
2011-10-31T14:28:00.000Z	KiwiK	ikonia	well thanks anyways :)
2011-10-31T14:29:00.000Z	ikonia	KiwiK	if it's a bug it needs fixing, however you need to verify it is a bug, or the conditions of the bug
2011-10-31T14:29:00.000Z	KiwiK	ikonia	i guess its a bug
