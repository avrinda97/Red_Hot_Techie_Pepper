2008-12-24T19:34:00.000Z	Mageiriki-me-bas		hi.
2008-12-24T19:35:00.000Z	Mageiriki-me-bas		there's a problem here. I type "sudo ./scanmodem" in my terminal (in Ubuntu 8.10) and it asks for a password but I CANNOT WRITE ANY PASSWORDS.
2008-12-24T19:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Mageiriki-me-bas	you type but it does not show.. that is normal
2009-01-03T01:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Mageiriki-me-bas	livecd's do have partition editor
2009-01-03T01:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Mageiriki-me-bas	Did you umount it first
2009-01-03T01:52:00.000Z	Mageiriki-me-bas	Jack_Sparrow	how?
2009-01-03T01:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Mageiriki-me-bas	are you in gparted?
2009-01-03T01:52:00.000Z	Mageiriki-me-bas	Jack_Sparrow	yes.
2009-01-03T01:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Mageiriki-me-bas	then as it says, unmount those partitions, I hope you are running livecd or not using any of them
2009-01-03T01:53:00.000Z	Mageiriki-me-bas	Jack_Sparrow	yes im on live cd. But how can i unmount it?
2009-01-03T01:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Mageiriki-me-bas	gparted, select the partiition and unmount it.. it is in the menu
2009-01-03T01:55:00.000Z	Mageiriki-me-bas	Jack_Sparrow	i cant see it in any of the menus.
2009-01-03T01:55:00.000Z	Mageiriki-me-bas	Jack_Sparrow	ok i did find it.
2009-01-03T01:56:00.000Z	Mageiriki-me-bas	Jack_Sparrow	now to install ubuntu i must make a Primary partition with ext2 filesystem?
2009-01-03T01:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Mageiriki-me-bas	leave unallocated space and the installer will do the work
2009-01-03T01:57:00.000Z	Mageiriki-me-bas	Jack_Sparrow	actually... i have a 250GB disk and the gparted sees only 225 of it!
2009-01-03T01:58:00.000Z	Mageiriki-me-bas	Jack_Sparrow	how can i make it see all of the other 25GB of the disk?
2009-01-03T01:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Mageiriki-me-bas	Probably a hidden partition  as in a recovery partition in a dell or hp etc
2009-01-03T02:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Mageiriki-me-bas	See what bagel says, common issue
2009-01-03T02:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Mageiriki-me-bas	hardware mfg want to use the bigger of the two not what it can in reality hold
2009-01-03T03:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Mageiriki-me-bas	THis was reported to work..  've recently solved a users atheros wireless problems by following this thread here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=986072   product: AR242x 802.11abg Wireless PCI Express Adapter.. Post #10 in that forum
