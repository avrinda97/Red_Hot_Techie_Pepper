2009-11-02T14:06:00.000Z	Jester05		hey guys
2009-11-02T14:06:00.000Z	Jester05		so i'm transferring data from one esata to another.. pulling 40mb/s :)
2009-11-02T14:07:00.000Z	Jester05		anybody else trying out mythbuntu 9.10
2009-11-02T14:07:00.000Z	Jester05		i'm installing in in my mythbox currently :)
2009-11-02T14:07:00.000Z	Jester05		86% done
2009-11-02T14:08:00.000Z	Jester05		does it have a thing for two usb connections
2009-11-02T14:08:00.000Z	SilentDis	Jester05	what tv cap card do you use?
2009-11-02T14:08:00.000Z	Jester05	SilentDis	i'm sporting 2 150s and 2 Dvico (for digital)
2009-11-02T14:09:00.000Z	SilentDis	Jester05	i ask, becuase i'm having problems with my pchdtv card.  messes up my ps/2 ports when i'm using it, so i can't use keyboard :P
2009-11-02T14:09:00.000Z	Jester05	SilentDis	easy fix.. usb keyboard ;)
2009-11-02T14:10:00.000Z	SilentDis	Jester05	therein lies the other problem.  ever since putting it in, my usb 'dies' occasionally for no reason lol
2009-11-02T14:10:00.000Z	Jester05	SilentDis	it honestly sounds like a voltage problem
2009-11-02T14:11:00.000Z	Jester05	SilentDis	and synical .. both sound like wattage issues :)
2009-11-02T14:11:00.000Z	SilentDis	Jester05	motherboard limitation or too small of a psu?  psu is an antec 650
2009-11-02T14:12:00.000Z	Jester05	SilentDis	at 650w u shouldn't be pushing it :-\ maybe try bios but ur getting into uncharted territory messing w/ voltages in there
2009-11-02T14:13:00.000Z	SilentDis	Jester05	this is a stepping stone board for me.  ASRock 939dual.  has ide/sata, AGP and PCIe, etc etc. no further bios updates out there.  i'm thinking that, at this point, it's time to upgrade a bit, which is unfortunatly something i can't quite afford yet :P
2009-11-02T14:14:00.000Z	Jester05	SilentDis	you may want to check newegg's openbox mobos out
2009-11-02T14:15:00.000Z	SilentDis	Jester05	so, you're thinking voltage issue?  no, i'm not gonna blame you if i fry the machine, but the board has quite a few different options in that regard.  suggestions on what to bump (slowly) first?
2009-11-02T14:17:00.000Z	Jester05	SilentDis	def go up slowly.. if u dont see a change after increasing 1-2 clicks.. dont go further.. I'd then revaluate and try to come up w/ a different diagnosis
2009-11-02T14:18:00.000Z	SilentDis	Jester05	bump processor voltage?  that doesn't seem to make sense to me.  trying to find options for pci cards and such isn't netting any results though
2009-11-02T14:20:00.000Z	Jester05	SilentDis	I mean increase PCI voltage.. my mobo has that option.. tho my old board is a chaintech..
