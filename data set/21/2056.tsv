2010-02-02T20:15:00.000Z	IdleOne	ithingLinux	depending on the model, there may be a package that can be installed that will provide the 3g support. With the model a helper can search and perhaps find other users who have the same card and found a fix or maybe that card not have 3g supported in linux...
