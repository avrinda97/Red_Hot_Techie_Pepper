2009-02-27T13:24:00.000Z	matamou		hi, anyone know where to get Acer 7720Z laptop wireless drivers, im bored of this network cable ^^
2009-02-27T13:24:00.000Z	matamou		oh, forgot to add the ?
2009-02-27T13:24:00.000Z	matamou		how?
2009-02-27T13:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	matamou	that will tell you the wireless chip
2009-02-27T13:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	matamou	run lspci
2009-02-27T13:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	matamou	its a terminal command
2009-02-27T13:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	matamou	once you know the wireless chip (i'llbet money its a broadcom with it being an acer) you can look into how to get it installed
2009-02-27T13:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	matamou	its what you know that counts
2009-02-27T14:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	matamou	format the partition would be my guess, it will remove ALL data on the partition so copy out anything you want beforehand
2009-02-27T14:48:00.000Z	matamou	ActionParsnip	: will it harm the grub?
2009-02-27T15:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	matamou	run: gksudo gparted
2009-02-27T15:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	matamou	you can format it there and then use it as data storage or whatever you wish
2009-02-27T15:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	matamou	does it all show in: sudo fdisk -l
2009-02-27T15:27:00.000Z	matamou	ActionParsnip	it still shows only sda1 and sda2 there :o ?
2009-02-27T15:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	matamou	then im guessing your other partitions arenet seen. Im guessing those are your / and /swp
2009-04-01T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	matamou	boot to xp cd and reinstall the boot sector, the guys in ##windows will advise well
2009-04-01T18:38:00.000Z	matamou	ActionParsnip	thanks, I will ask them. But what do you mean exactly, reinstalling the boot sector?
2009-04-01T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	matamou	you need to run the fixmbr and fixboot command
2009-04-01T18:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	matamou	you need an XP cd to reinstall the boot sector, its a windows issue though
2009-04-06T14:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	matamou	i think vlc plays it, mplayer can with codecs (afaik)
