2007-05-30T06:25:00.000Z	Flannel	Chillyboarder	don't install automatix.  Its no good.
2007-05-30T06:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Chillyboarder	enable universe, and install gnome-ppp then.
2007-05-30T06:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Chillyboarder	you need to enable universe
2007-05-30T06:28:00.000Z	Chillyboarder	Flannel	1st link is 500 internal error, 2nd link dunt even work.
2007-05-30T06:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Chillyboarder	read what sldkfj just said
2007-05-30T06:31:00.000Z	Flannel	Chillyboarder	Automatix won't be able to help you there either.  Do you have the desktop CD or the alternate CD?
2007-05-30T06:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Chillyboarder	You don't need gnome-ppp to connect though.  That's just eyecandy.  Also, if you want, you can sneakernet it to that machine.
2007-05-30T06:39:00.000Z	Flannel	Chillyboarder	of course.  It comes ready for ppp too.

2007-05-30T06:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Chillyboarder	Of course you won't be able to install any additional packages.  You don't have the internet.  Which is whythe first link is there.

2007-05-30T06:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Chillyboarder	no.  But you shouldn't be using either.  use System > Administration > Networking
2007-05-30T06:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Chillyboarder	even if you only use it once. once you're connected, you can get gnome-ppp
2007-05-30T06:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Chillyboarder	No.  You'll use the networking GUI each time.  Until you install the gnome monitor
2007-05-30T06:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Chillyboarder	System > Admin  > Networking
2007-05-30T06:52:00.000Z	Chillyboarder	Flannel	I'm under my modem setings, and choose "tone" then click ok, then close, then go back to it, and its back to "pulse"
2007-09-08T08:12:00.000Z	Flannel	Chillyboarder	Have you tried 7.04?
