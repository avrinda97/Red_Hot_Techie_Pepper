2005-08-07T12:30:00.000Z	AvatarofVirgo		What happens if a storm nocks my power out, does it recover well?
2005-08-07T12:32:00.000Z	AvatarofVirgo		Is there any faster way to get cd's?  I'm kind of impatient.
2005-08-07T12:34:00.000Z	AvatarofVirgo		I have dialup.
2005-08-07T12:34:00.000Z	AvatarofVirgo		Not really, I live in area where I hate every one.  Don't ask.
2005-08-07T12:35:00.000Z	AvatarofVirgo		I've only lived here for about 5 years.
2005-08-07T12:35:00.000Z	AvatarofVirgo		I ordered some last night.
2005-08-07T12:37:00.000Z	AvatarofVirgo		I guess I can wait for it.  The quality of the cd's will be better then burned cd's.  I noticed cd-r's tend to scratch easy and don't last as long.
2005-08-07T12:38:00.000Z	AvatarofVirgo		I was just on there site and it said October.
2005-08-07T12:39:00.000Z	AvatarofVirgo		I guess I better get downloading, I'll still get the cd's in the mail any way.
2005-08-07T12:40:00.000Z	AvatarofVirgo		Is it just one cd iso?  Because that should take about oh 3 days on dialup.
2005-08-07T12:41:00.000Z	f_newton	AvatarofVirgo	yer gonna get the cds in the mail before you finish downloading the install iso then installing the rest of the os from thenet
2005-08-07T12:44:00.000Z	f_newton	AvatarofVirgo	I live in Dallas... maybe we can work something out
2005-08-07T12:45:00.000Z	AvatarofVirgo	f_newton	What do you have in mind?
2005-08-07T12:46:00.000Z	f_newton	AvatarofVirgo	thats what my laptop is
2005-08-07T12:47:00.000Z	f_newton	AvatarofVirgo	that sounds like a dell
2005-08-07T12:51:00.000Z	f_newton	AvatarofVirgo	look up your local LUG, linux users group
2005-08-07T12:52:00.000Z	f_newton	AvatarofVirgo	thats not a big deal
2005-08-07T13:14:00.000Z	f_newton	AvatarofVirgo	i think you can find a better laptop for around the same money dude
2005-08-07T13:16:00.000Z	f_newton	AvatarofVirgo	you can get, for example, a completely refurbished or new dell 1 gig laptop for under 500\
2005-08-07T13:16:00.000Z	f_newton	AvatarofVirgo	you live near one of the best dell outlet stores on the planet
2005-08-07T13:27:00.000Z	f_newton	AvatarofVirgo	that one would be perfect for you
