2006-06-27T15:08:00.000Z	dura		Depends
2006-06-27T15:08:00.000Z	dura		It's usually with the torrent... and it's usually hidden
2006-06-27T15:08:00.000Z	dura		so like .foo
2006-06-27T15:08:00.000Z	dura		If you have to type a password with sudo, just use su
2006-06-27T15:08:00.000Z	dura		or su -
2006-06-27T15:10:00.000Z	LjL	dura	where you talking to me about the "su -" thing?
2006-06-27T15:10:00.000Z	dura	LjL	No... just said it in general
2006-06-27T15:10:00.000Z	LjL	dura	anyway i don't see how you *can* use "su -" in ubuntu
2006-06-27T15:10:00.000Z	dura	LjL	I do it daily
2006-06-27T15:10:00.000Z	LjL	dura	except, that is, by... using sudo
2006-06-27T15:11:00.000Z	LjL	dura	then you have enabled the root password. while it's your right, as it's your computer, please don't advice doing that to people.
2006-06-27T15:11:00.000Z	dura	LjL	Using sudo and typing a password is just as redundent as using sudo su lol
2006-06-27T15:12:00.000Z	LjL	dura	deprecated? heck, no. it's just no longer needed. the standard way to pass options is "-x" or "--xyz", and while tar allows leaving the "-" out, it's certainly not deprecated
2006-06-27T15:12:00.000Z	LjL	dura	err, except that if you type "sudo su", you're using a program that changes your privileges (sudo) to run a program that changes your privileges (su) -- and that's redundant
2006-06-27T15:13:00.000Z	dura	LjL	You're preaching to the choir...
2006-06-27T15:25:00.000Z	dura	LjL	Are you a moderator?
2006-06-27T15:25:00.000Z	LjL	dura	please stop using that kind of tone on this channel, with Jimmey or with anyone else
2006-06-27T15:25:00.000Z	LjL	dura	why does it matter?
2006-06-27T15:26:00.000Z	dura	LjL	Unles you are, telling people how to treat others isn't your job.
2006-06-27T15:26:00.000Z	LjL	dura	ok, let's do the jobs to those who are appointed to it then
2006-06-27T15:27:00.000Z	dura	LjL	Did you read what he said to me?
