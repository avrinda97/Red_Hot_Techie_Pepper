2009-02-12T07:25:00.000Z	carpii		fdisk -l is no longer listing my /dev/hdb, and attempting to mount /dev/hdb1 is resulting in "wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdb"  what gives?
2009-02-12T07:26:00.000Z	carpii		Titan, im not sure. My web hosting provider just added it, but they mounted it as ext3 in /home2 which was working ok
2009-02-12T07:27:00.000Z	carpii		I just changed their entry in /etc/fstab and did "mount -a" and now its all gone pear shaped
2009-02-12T07:28:00.000Z	carpii		no Titan, its a physical local drive
2009-02-12T07:28:00.000Z	carpii		i do wolter
2009-02-12T07:29:00.000Z	wolter	carpii	thanks god. Are you having problems with suspend?
2009-02-12T07:29:00.000Z	carpii		hm, well i dont use ubuntu on it anymore :(
2009-02-12T07:29:00.000Z	carpii		but suspend problems are usually to do with a missing dell media partition i think
2009-02-12T07:30:00.000Z	carpii		Titan, http://paste.ubuntu.com/117099/
2009-02-12T07:30:00.000Z	wolter		oh carpii ... well, I am using ubuntu..
2009-02-12T07:30:00.000Z	wolter		linux should fix this immediately
2009-02-12T07:30:00.000Z	carpii		Titan, i changed it back to /home2, so afaik its the same as my webhost left it when it was mounted successfully
2009-02-12T07:31:00.000Z	wolter	carpii	when you did use ubuntu, were you able to suspend/sleep?
2009-02-12T07:31:00.000Z	carpii	wolter	im not sure its a linux problem specifically
2009-02-12T07:31:00.000Z	carpii	wolter	yes, but i made sure i didnt nuke the dell partition
2009-02-12T07:31:00.000Z	wolter	carpii	hm...
2009-02-12T07:31:00.000Z	wolter		i did nuked it haha
2009-02-12T07:31:00.000Z	wolter		but that shouldn't affect ubuntu at all.
2009-02-12T07:32:00.000Z	carpii	wolter	you have to be careful, because trying to use the media buttons when youve nuked the partition can render the machine unbootable :/
2009-02-12T07:32:00.000Z	carpii		at least thats what ive read in ubuntu forums. it happened lots
2009-02-12T07:32:00.000Z	wolter	carpii	well, i can always turn off by pressing the power-off button for some seconds..
