2011-01-17T01:26:00.000Z	EagleCZ		hello, I have few problems... First - my audio isn't working but i have installed the drivers that should work... now i cant find any settings for my sound input/output, any idea?
2011-01-17T01:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EagleCZ	run: alsamixer  in terminal, are the levels cranked and unmuted
2011-01-17T01:27:00.000Z	EagleCZ	ActionParsnip	alsamixer: error while loading shared libraries: libasound.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2011-01-17T01:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EagleCZ	can you also run:  wget -O alsa-info.sh http://alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && bash ./alsa-info.sh      say yes to the upload and give the red hyperlink  generated. Thanks
2011-01-17T01:28:00.000Z	EagleCZ	ActionParsnip	http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=75fa799ea92812495705e47c9b733982d0d729bb
2011-01-17T01:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EagleCZ	sudo apt-get install libasound2 libasound2-dev      should fix the missing file for you :)
2011-01-17T01:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EagleCZ	read your output, see how there are no utilities listed, thats not good. Try:   sudo apt-get --reinstall install alsa-utils    then rerun the alsa script, is it now present?
2011-01-17T01:31:00.000Z	EagleCZ	ActionParsnip	what was the script again please?
2011-01-17T01:33:00.000Z	EagleCZ	ActionParsnip	the reinstall went ok but alsamixer gives approximately this: cannot open mixer: file or directory does not exist
2011-01-17T01:34:00.000Z	EagleCZ	ActionParsnip	(im translating it from czech so it may varry)
2011-01-17T01:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EagleCZ	the command is: alsamixer   not just mixer
2011-01-17T01:35:00.000Z	EagleCZ	ActionParsnip	yes i did input alsamixer
2011-01-17T01:36:00.000Z	EagleCZ	ActionParsnip	eaglewatch@eaglewatch-pc:~$ sudo alsamixer
2011-01-17T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EagleCZ	no need for sudo
2011-01-17T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EagleCZ	don't add sudo to every file, you will break your OS
2011-01-17T01:36:00.000Z	EagleCZ	ActionParsnip	and yes, i tried both with and without sudo so it doesnt make difference
2011-01-17T01:37:00.000Z	EagleCZ	ActionParsnip	still does not exist
2011-01-17T01:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EagleCZ	then try:  sudo apt-get --reinstall install alsa-base
2011-01-17T01:39:00.000Z	EagleCZ	ActionParsnip	Still does not exist
2011-01-17T23:50:00.000Z	EagleCZ	ActionParsnip	Where can i found such command?
2011-01-17T23:52:00.000Z	EagleCZ	ActionParsnip	I just spent half an hour looking for it and nothing
