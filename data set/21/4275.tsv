2008-05-26T07:17:00.000Z	WobWork		hiho folks. We're trying to run an ubuntu box as a kiosk for a trade show, and we basically want to start firefox without any window manager. Is that possible?
2008-05-26T07:17:00.000Z	anirudh0	WobWork	yes...but you'll be pretty much stuck with firefox
2008-05-26T07:18:00.000Z	WobWork	anirudh0	That's fine =)
2008-05-26T07:18:00.000Z	anirudh0	WobWork	try using emerald with a transparent skin
2008-05-26T07:18:00.000Z	anirudh0	WobWork	i mean your computer will be useless except for the firefox window
2008-05-26T07:18:00.000Z	WobWork	anirudh0	how do you mean? All we need is the firefox functionality
2008-05-26T07:19:00.000Z	anirudh0	WobWork	even alt+f2 wont do anything...you'll have to login again
2008-05-26T07:19:00.000Z	anirudh0	WobWork	ok
2008-05-26T07:19:00.000Z	WobWork	anirudh0	aye, that's fine
2008-05-26T07:20:00.000Z	WobWork	anirudh0	I was under the impression that we just had to replace a call to the windowmanager in one of the startup scripts to call firefox, but we're having problems finding precisely where in ubuntu it lies.
2008-05-26T07:29:00.000Z	WobWork	anirudh0	Any ideas?
2008-05-26T07:59:00.000Z	WobWork	anirudh0	any pointers to my previous question, or should I toss it up again?
2008-05-26T08:00:00.000Z	anirudh0	WobWork	forgot your question :)
2008-05-26T08:00:00.000Z	WobWork	anirudh0	=)
2008-05-26T08:00:00.000Z	anirudh0	WobWork	the firefox thing right?
2008-05-26T08:00:00.000Z	WobWork	anirudh0	I was looking for a location in one of the startup scripts where I could replace the call for the windows manager and get it to just run firefox
2008-05-26T08:01:00.000Z	anirudh0	WobWork	not sure if that will work
2008-05-26T08:02:00.000Z	anirudh0	WobWork	add this to the session startup then ...firefox &&sudo killall compiz
2008-05-26T08:02:00.000Z	anirudh0	WobWork	in system->prefs->sessions
2008-05-26T08:02:00.000Z	WobWork	anirudh0	I'll give that a go
2008-05-26T08:03:00.000Z	anirudh0	WobWork	sure..good luck for the trade show
