2008-12-10T00:50:00.000Z	Slade605		Hey guys, I've volume adjusters on my Keyboard and it shows the volume going up but isn't changing anything at all, any suggestions on where to look?
2008-12-10T00:52:00.000Z	cousteau	Slade605	the speaker icon in your desktop may change
2008-12-10T00:52:00.000Z	cousteau		or, hover the speaker icon, read the volume, use the vol keys and hover the icon again
2008-12-10T00:52:00.000Z	Slade605	cousteau	That is the wierd thing, the onscreen volume level shows up and changes it, it USED TO work before getting my mic to work but now this doesn't adjust anything
2008-12-10T00:53:00.000Z	Slade605	cousteau	It feels like it's adjusting something I am not using like a surround sound speaker or something like that
2008-12-10T00:53:00.000Z	cousteau	Slade605	double-click the icon so you can see all your controls
2008-12-10T00:54:00.000Z	Slade605	cousteau	did that, and when i press it up or down it shows change, but none of them move, for playback or recording
2008-12-10T00:54:00.000Z	cousteau		maybe you changed the "controlled device"
2008-12-10T00:54:00.000Z	cousteau	Slade605	there are about 5 screens with different tabs
2008-12-10T00:56:00.000Z	cousteau	Slade605	which device is selected when you right-click the volume icon and select "preferences"?
2008-12-10T00:56:00.000Z	cousteau		mine is "ALSA mixer, Master mono"
2008-12-10T00:56:00.000Z	Slade605	cousteau	Master, under the HDA intel (ALSA Mixer)
2008-12-10T00:57:00.000Z	Slade605	cousteau	 when using the volume control with my mouse I adjust master under HDA intel and I can hear a clear difference in volume
2008-12-10T00:58:00.000Z	cousteau		but you can't hear any difference when you use the keys?
2008-12-10T00:58:00.000Z	Slade605	cousteau	and the icon matches the actual volume, the keys don't adjust the icon at all
2008-12-10T00:58:00.000Z	Slade605	cousteau	it does the whole onscreen speaker and volume level when I use the keys
2008-12-10T00:58:00.000Z	cousteau		maybe the keys are affecting another control, or no one
2008-12-10T00:59:00.000Z	Slade605	cousteau	that is what I am thinking, I just don't have any idea how to change it
2008-12-10T00:59:00.000Z	cousteau		oh, like the built-in amplifier
2008-12-10T00:59:00.000Z	Slade605	cousteau	 I did system >preferences > keyboard short cuts, and it's setup correctly
2008-12-10T01:00:00.000Z	Slade605	cousteau	 I just added a few more items to playback, and it looks like it's affecting microphone playback
