2007-10-28T04:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		 If you got a .iso file - you can esaially mount it to a directory

2007-10-28T04:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		Vmware-server is free to use - you can get a free serial # from the vmware web site.
2007-10-28T04:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		I missee why he was even needing to use vmware.
2007-10-28T04:39:00.000Z	ShoopedUp	Dr_Willis	I don't have a cd burner/dvd burner
2007-10-28T04:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ShoopedUp	 boot and do 'what' with it exactly?
2007-10-28T04:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ShoopedUp	 you can easially use vmware-server to boot iso files as a way to 'test' the live cd.
2007-10-28T04:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ShoopedUp	 virtualbox can do that also. but i had issues with some live cds last i tried it.
2007-10-28T04:44:00.000Z	ShoopedUp	Dr_Willis	Guru: sorry I was on the phone with a friend that neeeded the calculus homework.
2007-10-28T04:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ShoopedUp	 vmware will let yiu install to a 'virtual' drive. NOT a real physical one.
2007-10-28T04:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ShoopedUp	 its a simple way to play with new os's
2007-10-28T04:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ShoopedUp	  it could../ but vmware emulated different hardware also.. So you might not want to do that.
2007-10-28T04:47:00.000Z	ShoopedUp	Dr_Willis	what are my options for permanently installying ubuntu?
2007-10-28T04:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ShoopedUp	 very few that i know of. :) Ive never done it that way.  Theres network boots and other things.. but youve not given muchinfo on what other machines you may have.
2007-10-28T04:49:00.000Z	ShoopedUp	Dr_Willis	what machines should I list? Are you talking about virtual machines?
2007-10-28T04:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ShoopedUp	  if you want to test out linux, doing so in vmware will work rather well. YOu can proberly find premade vmware-images for ubuntu
2007-10-28T04:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ShoopedUp	 if you had more then 1 pc. you could set 1 up to boot/install onto the other.
2007-10-28T04:50:00.000Z	ShoopedUp	Dr_Willis	I have 3 personal computers
2007-10-28T04:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ShoopedUp	 check out that !install factoid then. you can set one to do a netboot  for the other you wish to install to. Good luck :)
2007-10-28T04:51:00.000Z	ShoopedUp	Dr_Willis	and Guru: Thanks you!
