2008-11-05T03:02:00.000Z	user2342	rubial	I googled and found how to replace it, but i did the wrong drive, how can I recover the drive now?
2008-11-05T03:03:00.000Z	rubial	user2342	what haveu done
2008-11-05T03:04:00.000Z	user2342	rubial	so I used terminal commands. Grub. then root (hd2,0), then setup (hd2,0) i believe, which is why its having problems now
2008-11-05T03:06:00.000Z	rubial	user2342	try root (hd0,0) then setup(hd0)
2008-11-05T03:07:00.000Z	rubial	user2342	sry use root (linux partiton) to acess grub files
2008-11-05T03:07:00.000Z	user2342	rubial	the problem at the moment isnt that grub isnt working, its that I can't access the drive I accidentally installed it to. I installed it to an external drive with just data on it in NTFS format
2008-11-05T03:08:00.000Z	user2342	rubial	so I need to remove grub from this drive (hd0 i believe), without killing the NTFS.
2008-11-05T03:09:00.000Z	rubial	user2342	thats should not be a problem whether u installed grub on a device or not u can acess it
2008-11-05T03:09:00.000Z	user2342	rubial	so what could cause the corruption?
2008-11-05T03:09:00.000Z	user2342	rubial	do you know of a way to remove grub?
2008-11-05T03:10:00.000Z	user2342	rubial	the other problem I have is i know I didnt install grub to hd0,0 how can I figure out where to make the root and where to do the setup?
2008-11-05T03:14:00.000Z	user2342	rubial	okay I did geometry
2008-11-05T03:15:00.000Z	user2342	rubial	I have found out that hd1,0 is linux , hd2 is my external ntfs, and hd0,0 is windows (hd0,1) is swap
2008-11-05T03:16:00.000Z	user2342	rubial	so I now what drive linux is on and everything else, is that what I set root to, and what i setup to?
2008-11-05T03:18:00.000Z	user2342	rubial	so I  want to root to the root of the linux drive, and then I want to setup to the drive with the MBR
