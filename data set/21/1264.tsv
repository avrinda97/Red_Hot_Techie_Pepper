2010-11-25T12:46:00.000Z	nomtv80	Okashi	yeh I haven't had a live cd for ubuntu not play sound for any comps I had.

2010-11-25T12:48:00.000Z	nomtv80	Okashi	have you tried a set of headphones
2010-11-25T12:49:00.000Z	Okashi	nomtv80	yeah, thourgh my speakers, I can try straight from the jack in the back if you'd like
2010-11-25T12:49:00.000Z	nomtv80	Okashi	so you know the speakers work
2010-11-25T12:50:00.000Z	nomtv80	Okashi	and the cable to them?
2010-11-25T12:51:00.000Z	Okashi	nomtv80	 OMG headphone work
2010-11-25T12:51:00.000Z	nomtv80	Okashi	it doesn't happen often but I've had jacks and cables fail a few times
2010-11-25T12:51:00.000Z	nomtv80	Okashi	there you go, computer fine ^_^
2010-11-25T12:51:00.000Z	Okashi	nomtv80	 that means there's something off with the speaker system right?
2010-11-25T12:52:00.000Z	Okashi	nomtv80	 I still might cry... my 2.1 speaker system....
2010-11-25T12:57:00.000Z	Okashi	nomtv80	Thank you, though I'm sad that something with my speakers is toasted I'm so glad that it's not a mobo/sound card issue.
2010-11-25T12:57:00.000Z	nomtv80	Okashi	anytime ;)
