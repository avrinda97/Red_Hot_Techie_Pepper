2006-11-10T16:29:00.000Z	trondare		ok, thanks anyways :(
2006-11-10T16:30:00.000Z	trondare		anyone else know how to fix gnome after it being borked by compiz?
2006-11-10T16:30:00.000Z	PuGz	trondare	i think i do... what have u done exactly?
2006-11-10T16:30:00.000Z	PuGz	trondare	and it failed and now ur gnome looks silly with no window titles?
2006-11-10T16:31:00.000Z	PuGz	trondare	oh... u have logged out and cant log in properly
2006-11-10T16:31:00.000Z	PuGz	trondare	different problem from what i thought
2006-11-10T16:31:00.000Z	PuGz	trondare	like Delkster said... did u put compiz in the gnome sessions so it automatically gets run when u log in?
2006-11-10T16:32:00.000Z	trondare	PuGz	i guess that's what the command does?
2006-11-10T16:32:00.000Z	PuGz	trondare	no... just running that command at the console doesnt do that i dont think
2006-11-10T16:32:00.000Z	trondare	PuGz	apparently :)
2006-11-10T16:33:00.000Z	trondare	PuGz	well actually, first i did just a 'compiz --replace gconf'
2006-11-10T16:34:00.000Z	trondare	PuGz	when i log in, gnome-settings-daemon is started, looks like that's what's hanging
2006-11-10T16:35:00.000Z	PuGz	trondare	you could try installing another window manager and using it to access the gconf-editor to fix any settings
2006-11-10T16:35:00.000Z	trondare	PuGz	what would i fix in the editor?
2006-11-10T16:35:00.000Z	PuGz	trondare	i dunno... perhaps search for some compiz stuff?
2006-11-10T16:37:00.000Z	trondare	PuGz	/ neil__ : any way i could reset _just_ the session settings?
2006-11-10T16:37:00.000Z	PuGz	trondare	dunno sorry
2006-11-10T16:54:00.000Z	trondare	PuGz	/ neil__ : fixed it, killed all instances of gconfd and removed .gconfd/saved_state
2006-11-10T16:54:00.000Z	PuGz	trondare	sweet... good work
2006-11-10T16:54:00.000Z	PuGz	trondare	something for me to commit to the old memory bank ;)
2006-11-10T16:55:00.000Z	PuGz	trondare	np... glad u fixed it
