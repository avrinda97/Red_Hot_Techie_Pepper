2005-02-08T13:01:00.000Z	mon		Hi, id like to chroot into my ubuntu partition, however i always get "permission denied". How's that possible?
2005-02-08T13:01:00.000Z	thenuke	mon	and you trying to do it as a root?
2005-02-08T13:02:00.000Z	mon	thenuke	yes. from gentoo. it works when i try to chroot into another partition+distro...
2005-02-08T13:02:00.000Z	thenuke	mon	:I
2005-02-08T13:03:00.000Z	thenuke	mon	well, if I were you, I would try to google 'chroot permission denied'
2005-02-08T13:03:00.000Z	thenuke		you might find similar cases with answers
2005-02-08T13:04:00.000Z	mon	thenuke	did, couldn't really find something relevant... it really seems ubuntu specific but i guess no one else has suffered this problem
2005-02-08T13:04:00.000Z	thenuke	mon	ok, that's weird then
2005-02-08T13:04:00.000Z	thenuke	mon	try also having a question in the forums?
2005-02-08T13:05:00.000Z	mon	thenuke	i know, that's what i'm here for :)
2005-02-08T13:05:00.000Z	mon	thenuke	good idea, i'll post there.
2005-02-08T13:06:00.000Z	mon	thenuke	oh, also i can't chroot to gentoo from within ubuntu. just to make thins more weird... (/bin/bash perm. denied)
2005-02-08T13:06:00.000Z	thenuke	mon	hm, I have had /dev/null : permission denied problems with chroot :)
2005-02-08T13:07:00.000Z	mon	thenuke	solved it?
2005-02-08T13:07:00.000Z	thenuke		that was corrected when I did umm.. what did I do.. .. umm.. I had to mount the partition which I wanted to chroot with -o bind option I guess
2005-02-08T13:07:00.000Z	thenuke		so you could try that too
2005-02-08T13:07:00.000Z	thenuke		mount /dev/hdX /mnt/hdX -o bind .. try that
2005-02-08T13:08:00.000Z	mon	thenuke	k i will
2005-02-08T13:12:00.000Z	thenuke		ooh, ubuntu-fi :D why I have not ever thought of that? even if I have seen many other countries have their own channels
2005-02-08T13:12:00.000Z	mon	thenuke	didn't mean to /msg btw
2005-02-08T13:13:00.000Z	thenuke	mon	heh, I do msg by accident ppl sooo often why I just try to say something to them :)
