2011-09-04T18:04:00.000Z	pr0zoid		can i duplicate my server simply by backing up all the files and restoring them to new ubuntu instance?
2011-09-04T18:05:00.000Z	pr0zoid		damn it..
2011-09-04T18:06:00.000Z	pr0zoid		the problem is that i don't have a place to store the backup on the server..
2011-09-04T18:07:00.000Z	pr0zoid		Gentoo64/thunsucker: i was thinking of mounting a windows share but i can't seem to access the file share from outside my network.
2011-09-04T18:08:00.000Z	pr0zoid		(ie. share on my local machine mounted on my linux server to create the location to store the backup)
2011-09-04T18:09:00.000Z	usr13	pr0zoid	If you try to access it from outside your network, you will have to take that up with your router, (or your sysadmin).
2011-09-04T18:15:00.000Z	pr0zoid	usr13	Yes.  I tried moving that machine to the dmz but that didn't help as well as port forward.
2011-09-04T18:16:00.000Z	usr13	pr0zoid	Well, that's what it takes, port forwarding.
2011-09-04T18:17:00.000Z	usr13	pr0zoid	Or create an alias on the router for it, (that is if you have another outside IP).
2011-09-04T18:19:00.000Z	pr0zoid	usr13	trying to mount windows fileshare here what i was trying to do - http://www.liberiangeek.net/2010/08/mount-windows-shares-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx-terminal/
2011-09-04T18:19:00.000Z	usr13	pr0zoid	but if you expose the server directly to the internet, you loose the security of being behind the router.
2011-09-04T18:20:00.000Z	pr0zoid	usr13	my local machine(win7) is behind a router the server(ubuntu10.04) is on the net
2011-09-04T18:20:00.000Z	usr13	pr0zoid	samba file sharing is designed to be done within a LAN
2011-09-04T18:21:00.000Z	usr13	pr0zoid	Punching a whole trhough a router for a samba share is beyond the scope of ubuntu support.
