2010-01-13T10:56:00.000Z	Jafah		! ok
2010-01-13T10:56:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	I have a nvidia 6200 card running on Karmic, is this the same withyou?
2010-01-13T10:57:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	go to System > Administration > Hardware drivers and choose the version 96 drivers, then click the "Activate" button at the bottom
2010-01-13T10:58:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	are you using compiz?
2010-01-13T10:59:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	the nvidia 6200 card does support compiz but there's a bug in the 5xxx and 6xxx cards that requires a special line in xorg.conf in order to run compiz
2010-01-13T11:04:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	ok, now y ou need to open a terminal and run this command: sudo nvidia-xconfig
2010-01-13T11:05:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	what was the error? use pastebin if needed
2010-01-13T11:06:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	we'll fix that, don't worry
2010-01-13T11:08:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	ok, now I need you to pastebin the contents of your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file to http://ubuntu.pastebin.com and give me the url
2010-01-13T11:12:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	ok, I got your paste, I'm looking it over
2010-01-13T11:15:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	you there?
2010-01-13T11:16:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	ok, your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file needs to look exactly like this: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/m231b086d
2010-01-13T11:17:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	That's including the fix for the compiz problem with your card. You should be able to save that file, log out and back in and everything should be fine including compiz if you want to run it
2010-01-13T11:17:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	the hardware drivers tool has never played well with the 6 series card
2010-01-13T11:18:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	I wasn't able to, not with the nvidia 6200 card, I think nvidia is phasing that card out
2010-01-13T11:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	I don't know about enabling it in bois, I never had to do that, you can just log out and back in and it should be ok
2010-01-13T11:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	or restart xserver
2010-01-13T11:24:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	alt+f2, type this in and run it: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2010-01-13T11:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	Then make the changes and save the file
2010-01-13T11:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	be aware that the "X" in X11 is an uppercase "X"
2010-01-13T11:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	Jafah	ok, let me know how it goes
