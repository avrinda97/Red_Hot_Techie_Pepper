2009-09-04T07:27:00.000Z	njero		hey all, I am sshed into a machine that is running as a desktop..  I am trying to remote reboot (as sudo), it says it is rebooting but never does
2009-09-04T07:28:00.000Z	neil_d	njero	does you terminal still respond to the keyboard?
2009-09-04T07:28:00.000Z	njero	neil_d	yep
2009-09-04T07:29:00.000Z	neil_d	njero	try "sudo -i" first
2009-09-04T07:30:00.000Z	njero	neil_d	sudo -i does the same
2009-09-04T07:30:00.000Z	njero	neil_d	if I try shutdown -r now that reboots right?
2009-09-04T07:30:00.000Z	njero	neil_d	I will try it, I just want to make sure if I succeed it comes back on :)
2009-09-04T07:31:00.000Z	neil_d	njero	that is important.  "sudo -i" is another way to get root access.
2009-09-04T07:31:00.000Z	njero	neil_d	read the man... yeah it is the same, sorry
2009-09-04T07:32:00.000Z	neil_d	njero	did "reboot" work?
2009-09-04T07:32:00.000Z	njero	neil_d	nope, not as sudo, not as root. shutdown -r now also did not work in either case
2009-09-04T07:32:00.000Z	njero	neil_d	is there a place in the logs I might find the error?
2009-09-04T07:35:00.000Z	njero	neil_d	no other ideas?
2009-09-04T07:36:00.000Z	neil_d	njero	no.
2009-09-04T07:36:00.000Z	njero	neil_d	okay, I will keep digging, cheers for trying :)
2009-09-04T08:09:00.000Z	neil_d	njero	I find pinging the host helpfull to know when it comes up, but be careful you aren't ping the DSL modem.
2009-09-04T08:09:00.000Z	njero	neil_d	it lives!
2009-09-04T08:09:00.000Z	njero	neil_d	I hve autossh setup so it calls me back :)
2009-09-04T08:09:00.000Z	neil_d	njero	great what fixed it?
2009-09-04T08:09:00.000Z	njero	neil_d	kahen: the solution totally sucks but worked :) http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=5193&page=3
2009-09-04T08:10:00.000Z	njero	neil_d	 I tried the last thing, then called /etc/init.d/reboot stop and voila
