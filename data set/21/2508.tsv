2011-12-12T11:05:00.000Z	theadmin	sasank	You probably want GameEditor or some stuff like that if you're so new to it
2011-12-12T11:07:00.000Z	theadmin	sasank	Sorry, does not exist
2011-12-12T11:15:00.000Z	theadmin	sasank	None, bah, ask somewhere else, this is NOT related to Ubuntu
2011-12-12T11:17:00.000Z	theadmin	sasank	It needs a bootloader
2011-12-12T11:19:00.000Z	theadmin	sasank	Their site.
2011-12-12T11:21:00.000Z	theadmin	sasank	Just google it already and you'll find your answers
2011-12-12T11:22:00.000Z	theadmin	sasank	You don't "get" c++, you get a c++ compiler. Ubuntu comes with one, it's called g++
2011-12-12T11:24:00.000Z	theadmin	sasank	in APT. You were told A THOUSAND OF GODDAMN TIMES
2011-12-12T11:26:00.000Z	theadmin	sasank	You can...
2011-12-12T11:27:00.000Z	theadmin	sasank	g++ something.cpp -o something.out
2011-12-12T11:39:00.000Z	theadmin	sasank	g++ file.cpp -o file.out
2011-12-12T12:13:00.000Z	theadmin	sasank	Whichever works for you
2011-12-12T12:13:00.000Z	theadmin	sasank	They are too different to compare
