2010-06-03T16:58:00.000Z	unop	holyguyver	i use aqualung
2010-06-03T16:59:00.000Z	holyguyver	unop	I have enver heard of aqualung?
2010-06-03T17:05:00.000Z	holyguyver	unop	tell me about aqualung?
2010-06-03T17:06:00.000Z	unop	holyguyver	well, seen as you're creating an .m3u. I'm not sure aqualung is for you - but it can easily handle thousands of entries as compared to some of the other stock players.
2010-06-03T17:08:00.000Z	holyguyver	unop	okay thanks for trying to help anyway :)
2010-06-03T17:09:00.000Z	unop	holyguyver	 http://aqualung.factorial.hu/screenshots.html
2010-06-03T17:09:00.000Z	unop	holyguyver	if you don't mind .xml playlists - aqualung should be great.
2010-06-03T17:10:00.000Z	holyguyver	unop	can it export to m3u or pls or such? as after I am done editing it I want it to be able to play in any player.
2010-06-03T17:11:00.000Z	unop	holyguyver	errm, no, not as far as I'm aware .. but you could fashion your own script to do that.
2010-06-03T17:12:00.000Z	holyguyver	unop	I am sorry, I am not a coder, so that would not be easy.
