2005-06-11T15:55:00.000Z	CoRzA		well it doesnt
2005-06-11T15:55:00.000Z	gm78	CoRzA	: No, you need to install the Nvidia drivers, you will on any distro. Any mainstream distro does not include the drivers because they are not open source
2005-06-11T15:56:00.000Z	CoRzA	gm78	i put Knoppix in before and it works fine
2005-06-11T15:56:00.000Z	gm78		well, open your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and tell me which display driver is installed
2005-06-11T15:57:00.000Z	CoRzA		i'd have to restart my computer to do that
2005-06-11T15:57:00.000Z	gm78	CoRzA	: what are you in right now?
