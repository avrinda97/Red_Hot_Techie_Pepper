2007-04-23T09:46:00.000Z	slavik	Sam__	if you have their residential package, they don't allow servers on those
2007-04-23T09:47:00.000Z	slavik	Sam__	if you have their residential package, you are not allowed to run a server of any kind, read their TOS :)
2007-04-23T09:51:00.000Z	slavik	Sam__	you have lots of filtered ports ...
2007-04-23T09:52:00.000Z	slavik	Sam__	as in someone is looking at the packets and then decides if it will let them through
2007-04-23T09:53:00.000Z	slavik	Sam__	I could try scanning all 65k ports ... but I am not going to do that
2007-04-23T09:55:00.000Z	slavik	Sam__	check your PM
2007-04-23T09:55:00.000Z	slavik	Sam__	2127 is filtered ... meaning not everything will go through
