2011-04-21T00:01:00.000Z	pluc		Hey folks. I seem to have misplaced my CTRL+C binding. It doesn't do anything anymore - but simply highlighting text will copy it. How can I restore the Copy key binding?
2011-04-21T00:02:00.000Z	maco	pluc	is this all over the desktop or just one app?
2011-04-21T00:03:00.000Z	pluc	maco	let me test
2011-04-21T00:03:00.000Z	maco	pluc	highlight to copy and middle click to paste is a feature on *all* Linux distros
2011-04-21T00:04:00.000Z	maco	pluc	ok so which app isnt letting you ctrl+C?
2011-04-21T00:04:00.000Z	pluc	maco	I don't middle click. I just select text and it goes in my clipboard, replacing whatever I had.
2011-04-21T00:04:00.000Z	pluc	maco	Chrome
2011-04-21T00:04:00.000Z	maco	pluc	if you middle click, you can paste what you've highlighted ;-)
2011-04-21T00:04:00.000Z	pluc	maco	Well actually, it could be because I was trying to paste content of my clipboard over a selection
2011-04-21T00:06:00.000Z	maco	pluc	mouse & keyboard buffer are supposed to be two separate ones (ie, you can copy one thing with the keyboard and another thing with the mouse and choose which to paste based on which you use for the pasting. i find this handy)
2011-04-21T00:06:00.000Z	maco	pluc	so trying to paste over highlighted text should work
2011-04-21T00:06:00.000Z	maco	pluc	i'm not really sure how Chromium handles keyboard shortcut stuff though :-/  i know in gnome apps you can turn on a setting where you're able to reset the shortcuts, which is what i was thinking you might have done
2011-04-21T00:07:00.000Z	pluc	maco	I understand what you're saying, but say I'm writing a blog post and I want to paste my clipboard over a selected sentence... I can't, because the selected sentence goes straight in my clipboard
2011-04-21T00:07:00.000Z	maco	pluc	do you have a clipboard manager in use?
2011-04-21T00:07:00.000Z	pluc	maco	Yes, Parcellite
2011-04-21T00:07:00.000Z	maco	pluc	because there should basically be two "slots" where copied stuff are stored, and the highlighted stuff should go into a different slot than the ctrl+c stuff. it shouldnt overwrite
2011-04-21T00:08:00.000Z	pluc	maco	let me try something.
2011-04-21T00:08:00.000Z	maco	pluc	hmm i havent used that one. does it list the last few things you copied?
2011-04-21T00:08:00.000Z	pluc	maco	Fixed it by disabling "Use Primary (Selection)" in Parcellite. Thanks!!
2011-04-21T00:09:00.000Z	maco	pluc	ooooh! the "combine both into one buffer" feature
2011-04-21T00:09:00.000Z	pluc	maco	exactly
