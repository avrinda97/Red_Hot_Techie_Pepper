2006-04-26T11:29:00.000Z	dli	noiesmo	mencoder (from mplayer), transcode, ffmpeg
2006-04-26T11:31:00.000Z	noiesmo	dli	hmm I want to say show people how to do something on ubuntu desktop and record it, so maybe video tut was wrong ??
2006-05-06T11:18:00.000Z	dli	noiesmo	I want scim be installed by default too, saving questions like how to type in another language
2006-05-06T11:19:00.000Z	noiesmo	dli	whaaat?
2006-05-06T11:19:00.000Z	dli	noiesmo	scim, the package
2006-05-27T14:42:00.000Z	dli	noiesmo	rsync -uv
2006-05-27T14:43:00.000Z	noiesmo	dli	using rysnc -rv with some excludes and includes
2006-05-27T14:43:00.000Z	dli	noiesmo	rsync -rvu
2006-05-27T14:43:00.000Z	dli	noiesmo	"man rsync" for more
2006-05-27T14:44:00.000Z	noiesmo	dli	will give it a go with the u flag
2006-05-27T14:45:00.000Z	noiesmo	dli	thought if I did rsync -rv /home/blah --include="blah" --exclude="*./" user@remote it would only update whats changed but maybe the u flags the go thanks for that
2006-05-27T14:48:00.000Z	noiesmo	dli	thanks very much that worked like a charm :)
2006-05-27T14:49:00.000Z	dli	noiesmo	so, try " man rsync " next time, I know it's a long man page
2006-05-27T14:50:00.000Z	noiesmo	dli	I did look at the man, but I was under the impression that rsync only copied files that had changed and didnt see the need for update flag but doh I was wrong
2006-05-27T14:58:00.000Z	noiesmo	dli	from looking at the man page if I add the --delete flag then anyfiles that the sender does not have will be removed from  the recievers system?
2006-05-27T14:59:00.000Z	dli	noiesmo	better test to make sure it's what you want
2006-05-27T15:00:00.000Z	noiesmo	dli	ok :)
2006-05-27T15:04:00.000Z	noiesmo	dli	thank you for your help the --delete cleared only what I explected ;)
2006-05-27T15:05:00.000Z	dli	noiesmo	have a look at rsnapshot , maybe, it's something helpful to you
2006-05-27T15:07:00.000Z	noiesmo	dli	ok I will, I mainly what to sync my home folder less a couple of things to my back server so if I get sick of this install I can just run my script then blow the install away without loosing emails and any other files etc I 'll chceck out the rnapshot to.
