2007-07-30T07:54:00.000Z	imikke		Hi, I'm running Ubuntu 7.04 and using the WUSB54G (by linksys) network card. About every 10-15 mins. the connection drops. I am not experincing the problem on any of my other PCs in the house. Any ideas?
2007-07-30T07:56:00.000Z	broman	imikke	... so am I... but I dont know the cause yet..
2007-07-30T07:57:00.000Z	imikke	broman	, are you using the same network adapter?
2007-07-30T07:57:00.000Z	broman	imikke	no... but I think its my ISP...
2007-07-30T07:57:00.000Z	broman	imikke	 ATT
2007-07-30T07:57:00.000Z	imikke		I have a 2wire gateway router, but I don't think it's the problem either
2007-07-30T07:58:00.000Z	imikke		I also have at&t
2007-07-30T07:59:00.000Z	broman	imikke	I am just running straight out of their dsl modem for now...
2007-07-30T07:59:00.000Z	imikke		right now I'm on vista, but i'm not being disconnected
2007-07-30T07:59:00.000Z	broman	imikke	.... and it only started recently doing that...
2007-07-30T07:59:00.000Z	imikke		same here
2007-07-30T08:00:00.000Z	imikke	broman	on this page it said the default drivers may not work in all cases https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/Linksys_WUSB54Gv4?highlight=%28WifiDocs%2FDevice%29
2007-07-30T08:00:00.000Z	imikke		So we may have to use ndiswrapper.
2007-07-30T08:00:00.000Z	broman	imikke	do you use torrent clients ?
2007-07-30T08:00:00.000Z	imikke		no I do not, broman
2007-07-30T08:01:00.000Z	imikke		is it easy to configure NDISwrapper?
2007-07-30T08:02:00.000Z	imikke		oh, let me try that
2007-07-30T08:03:00.000Z	broman	imikke	... hmmm... I do, and I thought I was being throttled... I have seen articles that say ATT is trying some new experiments... I am seriously considering cable soon...
2007-07-30T08:03:00.000Z	imikke	broman	but it's not happening to my windows or mac computers, only my ubuntu installation.
2007-07-30T08:03:00.000Z	imikke		so I doubt it's at&t.
2007-07-30T08:04:00.000Z	broman	imikke	thanks for that info...
