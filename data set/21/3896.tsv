2008-11-19T06:46:00.000Z	savid		I just upgrade to intrepid, but for some reason xorg isn't using the nvidia driver,   and nvidia isn't showing up in the restricted drivers list  like it used to.  Why is that?
2008-11-19T06:47:00.000Z	jrib	savid	did you check the release notes
2008-11-19T06:47:00.000Z	savid	jrib	negative :-p
2008-11-19T06:48:00.000Z	savid	jrib	thanks
2008-11-19T06:55:00.000Z	savid	jrib	ok, I installed nvidia-glx-177,  and went back to "Hardware Drivers",  and still don't see nvidia in the list...
2008-11-19T06:56:00.000Z	jrib	savid	right, that's not what I said :)  You were supposed to check if your card was mentioned in the release notes
2008-11-19T06:56:00.000Z	savid	jrib	it  was
2008-11-19T06:56:00.000Z	jrib	savid	did it say that you need to use nv now?
2008-11-19T06:58:00.000Z	savid	jrib	no, I want to use proprietary
2008-11-19T06:58:00.000Z	savid	jrib	I need to get xgl/compiz working
2008-11-19T06:59:00.000Z	jrib	savid	well "want" and "can" are two different things
2008-11-19T06:59:00.000Z	savid	jrib	 I understood,  but any idea why nvidia's not showing up in the restricted drivers list?
2008-11-19T07:00:00.000Z	jrib	savid	I think they are working on it.  nvidia needs to release compatible drivers for some cards and the new X
2008-11-19T07:03:00.000Z	savid	jrib	seriously? so I can't get accelerated nvidia working at all in intrepid?
2008-11-19T07:04:00.000Z	jrib	savid	if that's what it said in the release notes about your card, then you have to wait.  It's being worked on.  Check bugs.ubuntu.com, there may be some packages you can test (or not)
2010-12-23T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	savid	fuser
2010-12-23T06:21:00.000Z	savid	jrib	 would it be just "lsof /dev/dsp"?
2010-12-23T06:23:00.000Z	jrib	savid	you can use fuser or lsof sure
2011-09-10T01:46:00.000Z	jrib	savid	also, what does « ls /usr/bin/do-release-upgrade » return?
2011-09-10T01:48:00.000Z	jrib	savid	also, what does « ls /usr/bin/do-release-upgrade » return?
2012-02-21T20:30:00.000Z	jrib	savid	see if the wiki is any help
