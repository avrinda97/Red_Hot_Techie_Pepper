2005-12-02T13:31:00.000Z	KasperTech		I can provide SSH to it.
2005-12-02T13:32:00.000Z	KasperTech		Please anyone, I've just bought this laptop and I really want to make it work..
2005-12-02T13:32:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	KasperTech	lol.. good luck, took me 5 laptops to get mine working
2005-12-02T13:32:00.000Z	KasperTech	pppoe_dude	Would you mind having a go at mine then
2005-12-02T13:33:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	KasperTech	what do you need?
2005-12-02T13:33:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	KasperTech	whats the video card on it?
2005-12-02T13:33:00.000Z	KasperTech	pppoe_dude	An ATI X600 Mobility.
2005-12-02T13:34:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	KasperTech	did u check ati's website? they're slow in getting linux drivers, but they usually do eventually make them
2005-12-02T13:35:00.000Z	KasperTech	pppoe_dude	Yes, and I've also run them... but it doesn't work.
2005-12-02T13:36:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	KasperTech	you need to edit your Xorg.conf file too
2005-12-02T13:36:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	KasperTech	did you do that?
2005-12-02T13:37:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	KasperTech	lol
2005-12-02T13:37:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	KasperTech	I would just read all the details in the readme's that came with the drivers
2005-12-02T13:37:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	KasperTech	they're usually apain in the ass, but thats the only thing you can do
2005-12-02T13:38:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	KasperTech	from my experience Ubuntu is best on laptops
2005-12-02T13:38:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	KasperTech	you can try fedora core
2005-12-02T13:50:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	KasperTech	try commenting out dri in the Modules section in xorg.conf
2005-12-02T14:02:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	KasperTech	are you trying to play games or watch movies orwhat?
2005-12-02T14:02:00.000Z	KasperTech	pppoe_dude	I'm trying to make tuxracer run
2005-12-02T14:03:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	KasperTech	welll i dunno for tux racer, but you can try and mess with mplayer -vo, try "mplayer -vo help" and try different drivers
