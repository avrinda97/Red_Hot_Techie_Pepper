2008-10-13T04:42:00.000Z	comicinker1		how can I mount an image made with partimage?
2008-10-13T04:42:00.000Z	karsten	comicinker1	mount -o loop -t <filesystem> <image> <mountpoint>
2008-10-13T04:43:00.000Z	comicinker1	karsten	it was a fat32 filesystem. when I use -t vfat, I receive: bad superblock. the partimage file was decompressed with unp. any idea?
2008-10-13T04:44:00.000Z	karsten	comicinker1	I'm not familiar with partimage.  Is this a partitioned filesystem image?  Does it contain partitions within it, or is it just a flat filesystem image?
2008-10-13T04:44:00.000Z	karsten	comicinker1	If there are partitions within the image, you need to supply an offset.
2008-10-13T04:44:00.000Z	comicinker1	karsten	just a flat filesystem. are you german?
2008-10-13T04:45:00.000Z	karsten	comicinker1	Not usually.
2008-10-13T04:46:00.000Z	karsten	comicinker1	If it is partitioned, you need to specify an offset.  See:  http://www.unix.com/filesystems-disks-memory/24366-can-loopback-filesystem-partitioned.html
2008-10-13T04:46:00.000Z	karsten	comicinker1	... I've run into that with qemu disk images (as deckard did in that post).
2008-10-13T04:48:00.000Z	karsten	comicinker1	If the image is compressed, yes, you'll have to uncompress it.
2008-10-13T04:48:00.000Z	karsten	comicinker1	Just reading partimage docs.
2008-10-13T04:49:00.000Z	karsten	comicinker1	... and I think it compresses by default.  Unless there's a loopback compressed filesystem driver/module, you'll have to decompress the file yourself.
2008-10-13T04:53:00.000Z	comicinker1	karsten	when I gzip -d image.dat.gz, I receive a file image.dat, however when I type in file image.dat I receive: (...) fat16 device /dev/sde, original filename backup_sd_1gb.img, gzip compressed     why is image.dat still gzipped?
2008-10-13T04:54:00.000Z	karsten	comicinker1	Not sure.  You might try looking at the first few hundred bytes with a hex editor.  Or:  dd if=image.dat bs=512 count=1 | od -c | less
2008-10-13T04:54:00.000Z	karsten	comicinker1	... which dumps the first 512 bytes.  IIRC 'file' is looking at the first 1024 (max) bytes of a file to work out what it is.  It's guessing, might be wrong, may have found a gzip header within the disk image.
2008-10-13T04:55:00.000Z	karsten	comicinker1	Try mounting the file yourself.
2008-10-13T04:55:00.000Z	karsten	comicinker1	RTFM ;-)
2008-10-13T05:32:00.000Z	comicinker1	karsten	dd if=/dev/zero of=filePart.part bs=1000k count=1000 && losetup /dev/loop0 filePart.part && partimage restore /dev/loop0 image.img.gz && mount /dev/loop0 /mnt
2008-10-13T05:32:00.000Z	karsten	comicinker1	Success?
2008-10-13T05:32:00.000Z	karsten	comicinker1	There you go ;-)
2008-10-13T05:34:00.000Z	comicinker1	karsten	thanks ;)
