2008-05-20T12:01:00.000Z	wolfwalker		I found a solution, but apparently I'm to dumb to use it.
2008-05-20T12:01:00.000Z	wolfwalker		I tried to install Ubuntu on flash drive.  When booted, Grub said error 17.
2008-05-20T12:02:00.000Z	wolfwalker		Found out you had to go in and edit menu.lst
2008-05-20T12:02:00.000Z	wolfwalker		So I booted from the CD and edited the menu.lst in the flash drive.
2008-05-20T12:02:00.000Z	Bodsda	wolfwalker	you installed on usb or put live cdversion on usb?
2008-05-20T12:03:00.000Z	Bodsda	wolfwalker	you have to open with sudo       gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-05-20T12:03:00.000Z	Bodsda	wolfwalker	just copy and paste that line into a terminal it will bring up a gui text editor
