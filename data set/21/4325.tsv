2008-06-17T23:27:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	yep  semes FIrefox in Ubuntu Hardy Heron is an officla Mozilla release rather than an Ubuntu version
2008-06-17T23:28:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	 Ubuntu used to use  Ubuntu versions of Firefox which were very similar to the offical release
2008-06-17T23:28:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	and now it seems they use Mozilla bilds.  Hardy Heron came with Firefox Beta 5, but if you turn on proposed updates in the package manager, you can get a later version that way
2008-06-17T23:33:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	 software gets old.  and unsppourted the way it is
2008-06-17T23:34:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	 and Ubuntu can update their own version of Firefox sure,  and even Mozila's with the source code
2008-06-17T23:34:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	 yes an old version of Firefox can be updated in 20 years time, why since it's open source
2008-06-17T23:34:00.000Z	nabcore	SebNaitsabes	no they cannot; read the thread
2008-06-17T23:35:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	also most people would just upgrade to the next one,  or stay with a LTS untill the next.  and so really old versions of Ubuntu get obsolute with old Firefox's
2008-06-17T23:35:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	and Firefox  3.0 will probably be still being suppourted just about by the time  the next Ubuntu LTS is released.  I said just about suppourted since I am assuming by then a Firefox 4.0 may be out
2008-06-17T23:36:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	and you could just install iceweasel or whtever anyway if you want
2008-06-17T23:40:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	 Debian is open source and free GPL software only where as Ubuntu has some propritary stuff to
2008-06-17T23:42:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	 iceweasel is for software freedom extermists, as a result Firefox is way more used than Icewesel
2008-06-17T23:42:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	and that was meant to be extermists
2008-06-17T23:42:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	ah  extremeists
2008-06-17T23:43:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	 Richard Stallman that is a prime example of a free software extremist
2008-06-17T23:44:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	 iceweasel is made for people like  Richard Stallman
2008-06-17T23:45:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	nabcore	since open source isn't even good enough for them,  I mean  yeah propritary software tends to be yuck since the lack of freedoms and all that.  ,but open source and free GPL software are so similar
