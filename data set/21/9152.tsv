2007-12-29T04:45:00.000Z	LjL	rodolfo	a what?
2007-12-29T04:46:00.000Z	rodolfo	LjL	some versions of windows is limited...i mean you can install 2x2GB on a windows "starter" edition, but it will only recognize 2GB of your 4GB...(thats an example). does that happen on ubuntu?
2008-01-26T04:44:00.000Z	rodolfo	LjL	nice.
2008-01-26T03:57:00.000Z	LjL	rodolfo	« apt-cache policy libc6 » and there is no XFree86, there is X.Org, do « apt-cache policy xorg »
2008-01-26T04:00:00.000Z	rodolfo	LjL	that's weird then. I got xf86-video-intel-2.1.x from my update manager and I run the installer...
2008-01-26T04:00:00.000Z	LjL	rodolfo	what installer? are you on gutsy? there is no xf86-video-intel-2.1.X package in gutsy
2008-01-26T04:03:00.000Z	rodolfo	LjL	yes, there is. I enabled releases candidates and unsupported updates repositories from synaptic and I got this file and 'xserver-xorg-video-intel'...
2008-01-26T04:05:00.000Z	LjL	rodolfo	could you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list, i'm not really familiar with the names that Software Sources gives to repositories
2008-01-26T04:06:00.000Z	rodolfo	LjL	I will pates the output on pastebin. just want you to know that this is the direct link to the file I'm talking about: http://xorg.freedesktop.org/archive/individual/driver/xf86-video-intel-2.2.0.tar.bz2
2008-01-26T04:07:00.000Z	LjL	rodolfo	eh? that is not a *package*. that's just a tarball. it can't come from the update manager or from any repositories.
2008-01-26T04:08:00.000Z	rodolfo	LjL	I know. This is for those who wants to build the installer and run it with a newer version of xorg (1.4+)
2008-01-26T04:09:00.000Z	LjL	rodolfo	well you didn't make yourself clear, you were talking about packages coming from the update manager. anyway we absolutely do NOT recommend installing things like video drivers from tarballs.
2008-01-26T04:11:00.000Z	rodolfo	LjL	what other choice do I have? fot (unlucky)users who has a i915-based-laptop, there aren't any other options. this is the link: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/53496/
2008-01-26T04:14:00.000Z	LjL	rodolfo	i thought intels were among the best supported cards... is that not the case with the 915? anyway, probably unrelated but having gutsy-proposed enabled is pretty much a terrible idea
2008-01-26T04:16:00.000Z	rodolfo	LjL	true but all I got from this "best supported driver" is a trashy performance when running compiz fusion. Not to mention that games like war craft III run very well on winxp but on wine it SUCKS.
2008-01-26T04:17:00.000Z	LjL	rodolfo	it might work badly on WINE for reasons totally unrelated to the card driver... you know WINE is simply not yet on par with Windows. as for compiz well that's hardly a necessity... i mean, if you're willing to trade it for an unstable system, it's your call but
2008-01-26T04:19:00.000Z	rodolfo	LjL	just a sec
2008-01-26T04:34:00.000Z	rodolfo	LjL	I've read all the FAQs available and as far as I know, this scenario happens due to intel poor performance using openGL. when running the game on winxp works perfectly because windows uses D3D. wine uses openGL(correct me if i'm wrong)
2008-01-26T04:39:00.000Z	LjL	rodolfo	err, it's badly worded at least. OpenGL and Direct3D are two ways for programs to interface to graphics cards' 3D facilities. Direct3D is proprietary and *only* directly available on Windows. OpenGL is what Linux uses (and Windows can, too, use, but discourages). what WINE does is *emulate* Direct3D using OpenGL - in order for Windows programs, which expect Direct3D, to work. that is the case *on any graphics card*. no card on Linux supports Direct3D
2008-01-26T04:40:00.000Z	LjL	rodolfo	if you want to run Windows games, you're probably much better off using Windows. WINE currently cannot offer anything near the performance of a native Windows environment, and its Direct3D support is also pretty new (you might want to investigate Cedega as well, but that's commercial). no newer driver will give you native Direct3D support under Ubuntu.
2008-01-26T05:01:00.000Z	rodolfo	LjL	do you know where i can set an environment variable?
