2012-11-25T18:16:00.000Z	jokke		hi, i'm having trouble importing mp4 files in shotwell. It causes shotwell to freeze. Is this a known problem? Maybe with a fix
2012-11-25T18:16:00.000Z	jokke		?
2012-11-25T18:18:00.000Z	jokke		fspot has mono dependencies
2012-11-25T18:18:00.000Z	jokke		:P
2012-11-25T18:18:00.000Z	jokke		what about tags
2012-11-25T18:19:00.000Z	bekks	jokke	digikam
2012-11-25T18:20:00.000Z	jokke	bekks	yeah, digikam is awesome, but it's a little TOO packed with features for my needs, and besides i'd like a gnome application
2012-11-25T18:21:00.000Z	bekks	jokke	I havent found a single gnome application fitting my needs - I dont use all that digikam features, but only the ones I want/need.
2012-11-25T18:22:00.000Z	bekks	jokke	You dont have to install KDE for using digikam. Install digikam only.
2012-11-25T18:22:00.000Z	bekks	jokke	And since there is no sane, comparable solution like digikam in gnome - thats the best choice then.
2012-11-25T18:40:00.000Z	jokke	bekks	you had any problems importing mp4 files?
2012-11-25T18:33:00.000Z	jokke	bekks	maybe you're right, it just bugs me to download 131 MB of packages, which most are shared libs not used for anything else.. Installed size is 522 Mb.. Shotwell is what, 2 MB download and maybe 10 installed..
2012-11-25T18:34:00.000Z	bekks	jokke	Do you have a very smal hard disk? Like 1GB? hard disk space is about 20 cents per gigabyte currently.
2012-11-25T18:36:00.000Z	jokke	bekks	yeah i have a 256Gig ssd. :P Also i'm currently online using gprs at roughly 7kB/s.. So 131 Mb is alot.. :P
2012-11-25T18:37:00.000Z	bekks	jokke	The harddisk is about... 2000 times larger than what you want to download. The only reason _could_ be yourdownload speed. And still, digikam would be worth it.
2012-11-25T18:41:00.000Z	bekks	jokke	I never used shotwell, and sI had no problems using digikam so far.
2012-11-25T18:41:00.000Z	jokke	bekks	okay
2012-11-25T18:42:00.000Z	bekks	jokke	Wrong approach.
2012-11-25T18:42:00.000Z	bekks	jokke	And never had a working system, either. But thats OT in here.
2012-11-25T18:50:00.000Z	bekks	jokke	Guest23651 is the wrong one. :) Guest65503 already left.
2012-11-25T18:50:00.000Z	bekks	jokke	He may, although almost noone will understand him.
