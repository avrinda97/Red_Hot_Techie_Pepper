2005-12-16T15:30:00.000Z	joshi		is there option for
2005-12-16T15:30:00.000Z	joshi		'ls' so it shows dirs first then files?
2005-12-16T15:32:00.000Z	dooglus	joshi	that's a good question.  I don't think there is though.
2005-12-16T15:32:00.000Z	dooglus	joshi	you could write a shell function to do it that way though pretty easily
2005-12-16T15:33:00.000Z	joshi	dooglus	want to teach me? or give some link where i can read about it?
2005-12-16T15:33:00.000Z	dooglus	joshi	I'll see what I can knock up.  Just a mo.
2005-12-16T15:39:00.000Z	dooglus	joshi	something like http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/5629 is a start.
2005-12-16T15:39:00.000Z	dooglus	joshi	you just need to copy-paste that into your .bashrc file.  then 'lls' will act like the ls you want
2005-12-16T15:42:00.000Z	joshi	dooglus	i tryed you given link... didnt work
2005-12-16T15:42:00.000Z	dooglus	joshi	what happened?
2005-12-16T15:42:00.000Z	joshi	dooglus	it says that command was not found
2005-12-16T15:44:00.000Z	dooglus	joshi	run a new bash shell.  type "bash" in an existing terminal, or run a new terminal.
2005-12-16T15:45:00.000Z	joshi	dooglus	ok.. it works on with bash
2005-12-16T15:45:00.000Z	joshi	dooglus	is it possible to run without need to switch to bash?
2005-12-16T15:45:00.000Z	dooglus	joshi	it will work in every shell you open from now on.
2005-12-16T15:46:00.000Z	dooglus	joshi	you only had to run bash that time because you were using an old shell - it had already read your old .bashrc
2005-12-16T15:46:00.000Z	dooglus	joshi	you'll notice that "lls -l" won't work, for instance.
2005-12-16T15:47:00.000Z	dooglus	joshi	but what I've given you is a good start at making something better...
2005-12-16T15:47:00.000Z	joshi	dooglus	but lls -l works :D
2005-12-16T15:48:00.000Z	dooglus	joshi	it doesn't list directories first though - or if it does, you're lucky :)
2005-12-16T15:48:00.000Z	dooglus	joshi	"lls -l" is strict alphabetical order
