2006-09-03T15:09:00.000Z	opexoc		Can you tell me how Linus could write linux? I know that he modeled his kernel on unix kernel, but how he knew unix kernel is build?
2006-09-03T15:11:00.000Z	ChaosFan	opexoc	i believe he used "Operating Systems: Design and Implementation" by Tanenbaum
2006-09-03T15:11:00.000Z	ChaosFan	opexoc	and implemented what he needed, then he opened the source, users used it, and they implemented what they needed. so it did grow
2006-09-03T15:14:00.000Z	opexoc	ChaosFan	I read that he was reading some source of some educational unix-like-kernel, maybe written by Tanenbaum... but if it is true, so how Tanenbaum knew how should looks like the unix kernel?
2006-09-03T15:15:00.000Z	ChaosFan	opexoc	he read the minix source
2006-09-03T15:15:00.000Z	ChaosFan	opexoc	thats the example OS discussed in the aforementioned book
2006-09-03T15:16:00.000Z	ChaosFan	opexoc	but minix uses a microkernel, linus decided to use a monolithic one, and how tanenbaum kew about the unix kernel... i think he just had enough experienced, he already taught the subject for a while back then
2006-09-03T15:16:00.000Z	opexoc	ChaosFan	hmm... so Minix has open soruce? Is it unix? Is there any unix which has open source?
2006-09-03T15:17:00.000Z	ChaosFan	opexoc	linux, for example. and minix is "open for educational purposes"
2006-09-03T15:18:00.000Z	opexoc	ChaosFan	hm... linux is not a unix...
2006-09-03T15:18:00.000Z	ChaosFan	opexoc	it's unix-like, but what do you want?
2006-09-03T15:19:00.000Z	opexoc	ChaosFan	 I want to find out is there truly unix which has open source?
2006-09-03T15:19:00.000Z	ChaosFan	opexoc	due to SCO, the answer to this question must be "no".
2006-09-03T15:20:00.000Z	opexoc	ChaosFan	so... minix is not really unix...
2006-09-03T15:21:00.000Z	ChaosFan	opexoc	only unix is really unix. and unix is owned by SCO.
2006-09-03T15:21:00.000Z	opexoc	ChaosFan	and linus did not base on true unix
2006-09-03T15:22:00.000Z	opexoc		I have gone there...
2006-09-03T15:22:00.000Z	ChaosFan	opexoc	i send you a private message
2006-09-03T15:23:00.000Z	opexoc	ChaosFan	I did not see any...
2006-09-03T15:24:00.000Z	ChaosFan	opexoc	my fault, the other channel, then
2006-09-03T15:28:00.000Z	opexoc	ChaosFan	but something else question I have... Could you back to #ubuntu-offtopic?
