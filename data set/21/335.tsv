2012-04-30T02:45:00.000Z	L3top	usr13	pers0n this is the second case of this reported today.
2012-07-19T02:12:00.000Z	L3top	usr13	I am pretty good in this arena if you get stuck.
2012-07-19T02:28:00.000Z	L3top	usr13	mac
2012-07-19T02:32:00.000Z	usr13	L3top	I think it was only a failed attempt at humor
2012-07-19T07:56:00.000Z	L3top	usr13	nothing is overheating atm. He installed fan control, and noticed his main fan on laptop was non functional.
2012-07-19T07:57:00.000Z	usr13	L3top	Your logic is correct...
2012-07-19T08:01:00.000Z	usr13	L3top	or  pastebinit /sys/devices/virtual/thermal
2012-07-19T08:33:00.000Z	L3top	usr13	It will never authenticate. No matter what you do.
2012-08-03T07:38:00.000Z	usr13	L3top	How do we know he doen't have a separate partition for /home/ ?
2012-08-03T07:39:00.000Z	L3top	usr13	I don't... it should be self evident if he does.
2012-08-03T07:40:00.000Z	L3top	usr13	I mean only that that doesn't happen by accident or automation. I didn't think explaining that if you had purposefully set a separate partition with home on it, that you would follow that advice, as it would have been done for this purpose.
2012-08-03T07:41:00.000Z	usr13	L3top	But it can be done after the fact as well.
2012-08-03T07:42:00.000Z	usr13	L3top	... in preparation for a distribution upgrade.
2012-08-03T07:43:00.000Z	L3top	usr13	he is wanting to do a fresh install of 1204 rather than upgrade through 3 versions... I do not believe that there can be an after the fact if it has not already been done for this purpose. Perhaps I misunderstand.
2012-08-03T07:43:00.000Z	usr13	L3top	Never mind...
2012-08-09T19:09:00.000Z	usr13	L3top	I don't think a screenshot will help us all that much.  He obviously has a video driver issue, or just screensize
2012-08-09T19:10:00.000Z	L3top	usr13	as near as I can decipher he is referring to something INSIDE a vm...
2012-08-09T19:10:00.000Z	usr13	L3top	Oh, ok. Well, I stand corrected.
2012-08-23T22:29:00.000Z	usr13	L3top	What?
2012-08-24T03:12:00.000Z	L3top	usr13	/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head
2012-08-24T03:14:00.000Z	L3top	usr13	sorry cat /etc/resolvconf/resolve.conf.d/head
