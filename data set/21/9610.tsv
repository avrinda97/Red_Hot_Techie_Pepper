2006-01-21T15:21:00.000Z	johnl		heh, ask away.
2006-01-21T15:21:00.000Z	johnl		let everyone hear it
2006-01-21T15:22:00.000Z	LaserJock	johnl	ok, I only have a terminal open right now and my free -m output says 400 MB of memory (out of 512)
2006-01-21T15:23:00.000Z	LaserJock	johnl	my computer seems to be using a lot of swap and firefox has been freezing a lot when I try to add a bookmark
2006-01-21T15:23:00.000Z	LaserJock	johnl	and synaptic or building packages (basically anything CPU or IO intensive) seems to drag my system a lot
2006-01-21T15:23:00.000Z	johnl	LaserJock	Ubuntu breezy?
2006-01-21T15:24:00.000Z	LaserJock	johnl	no dapper
2006-01-21T15:24:00.000Z	LaserJock	johnl	reboot seems to help but then the memory usage keeps going up until after a few days it is hard to use
2006-01-21T15:24:00.000Z	LaserJock	johnl	seems like a mem leak of some kind to me
2006-01-21T15:25:00.000Z	LaserJock	johnl	but it started doing this to me a few weeks ago so I wonder if it was one of the kernel upgrades
2006-01-21T15:26:00.000Z	johnl	LaserJock	how are you measuring memory usage?
2006-01-21T15:26:00.000Z	LaserJock	johnl	well, free -m and top
2006-01-21T15:27:00.000Z	johnl	LaserJock	is it slow now?  can you paste the output from free -m?
2006-01-21T15:29:00.000Z	LaserJock	johnl	right now it seems ok, I have only a termianl open and here is the free -m output http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/7224
2006-01-21T15:29:00.000Z	LaserJock	johnl	but when I have firefox and thunderbird open my memory get's eaten up and pretty soon I have nothing free
2006-01-21T15:31:00.000Z	LaserJock	johnl	I just don't see any reason why just having a terminal open I should have 400MB used
2006-01-21T15:31:00.000Z	LaserJock	johnl	but it does take a few days to get that way
2006-01-21T15:33:00.000Z	LaserJock	johnl	I just opened up firefox and it is just sitting there and I can see the mem usage go up 1MB at a time
2006-01-21T15:33:00.000Z	johnl	LaserJock	I think the problem is that so much is changing with dapper, it'd be difficult to pinpoint what was causing the problem exactly.
2006-01-21T15:33:00.000Z	LaserJock	johnl	exactly
2006-01-21T15:33:00.000Z	johnl	LaserJock	 can you roll back to an older dapper kernel?
