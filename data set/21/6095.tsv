2007-06-08T08:29:00.000Z	cables	logmein	pidgin is gaim, how is gaim better than pidgin?
2007-06-08T08:29:00.000Z	logmein	cables	pidgin has shitty text editing features, its downgraded the ability to have multi colored text and so forth
2007-06-08T08:29:00.000Z	logmein	cables	plus most plugin packages don't work with it
2007-06-08T08:30:00.000Z	cables	logmein	stick with Gaim on Feisty, but when Gutsy comes out all the packages will be for Pidgin.
2007-06-08T08:30:00.000Z	logmein	cables	then I'm going to have to modify the pidgin source with some old gaim features
2007-06-08T08:30:00.000Z	cables	logmein	that's totally not true, it has the same formatting toolbar Gaim had.
2007-06-08T08:31:00.000Z	logmein	cables	try to have part of what you type in one font with color then the next part different font and color so forth
2007-06-08T08:31:00.000Z	logmein	cables	you can't emphasize what you type
2007-06-08T08:31:00.000Z	cables	logmein	when you say gaim, are you referring to 1.5?
2007-06-08T08:31:00.000Z	cables	logmein	sure can, I just did. I had multiple fonts and colors and stuff across different parts of a message.
2007-06-08T08:32:00.000Z	cables	logmein	2.0.1
2007-06-08T08:33:00.000Z	cables	logmein	Pidgin is one of the best clients I've used, but not for supporting each protocol's features.
2007-06-08T08:33:00.000Z	cables	logmein	I think they're going to consider working on voice/video support in v3
2007-06-08T08:33:00.000Z	logmein	cables	there has already been some work done on that if you check sourceforge
2007-06-08T08:33:00.000Z	logmein	cables	all they have to do is get it working properly
2007-06-08T08:34:00.000Z	cables	logmein	I know there are builds of Gaim w/ audio support, but they're based on 1.5
2007-06-08T08:34:00.000Z	logmein	cables	I want festival to work with gaim too
2007-06-08T08:34:00.000Z	cables	logmein	it does
2007-06-08T08:35:00.000Z	cables	logmein	you can't expect Ubuntu's plugin packages to support Pidgin. However, Gutsy will have all the same plugin packages, except for Pidgin.
2007-06-08T08:35:00.000Z	cables	logmein	Gaim beta 6 is basically the same as Pidgin, so you should stick with that for the time being (because it's supported w/ packages from the repos)
2007-06-08T08:35:00.000Z	cables	logmein	but in Gutsy, Pidgin will do everything Gaim 2 b 6 does
