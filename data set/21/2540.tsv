2009-09-13T20:20:00.000Z	euphorian		does anyone use fluxbox anymore
2009-09-13T20:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	euphorian	yeah, its cool
2009-09-13T20:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	euphorian	I use LXDE mainly but fluxbox is great
2009-09-13T20:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	euphorian	thres a few ways to make it act different but it is a massive bloat in ram
2009-09-13T20:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	euphorian	you could try swiftfox or kazenchase
2009-09-13T20:31:00.000Z	euphorian	ActionParsnip	thanks ill try that
2009-09-13T20:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	euphorian	they use gecko for rendering etc but are lighter
2009-09-13T20:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	euphorian	kazencase is the default browser in fluxbuntu
2009-09-13T20:33:00.000Z	euphorian	ActionParsnip	i started with standard ubuntu but wanted to optimize it so i tried XFCE and now im trying fluxbox
2009-09-13T20:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	euphorian	try a few, see which you like. LXDE is light too and has a menu button in the bottom left which flux doesnt have, flux has great support for shortcut combinations
2009-09-13T20:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	euphorian	swappiness dictates how ofter your swap partition is used, if you have acres of ram you can set the swappiness quite low so the system doesnt use the swap unless really needed. If you have not then a higher value can help
2009-09-13T20:37:00.000Z	euphorian	ActionParsnip	I have only 512mb of ram
2009-09-13T20:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	euphorian	then you'll need to evaluate your game, I have 2Gb ram now and a swappiness of 5 so it doesnt get used as I rarely exceed this
2009-09-13T20:41:00.000Z	euphorian	ActionParsnip	I installed swiftfox from an apt repository, and it does not run
2009-09-13T20:42:00.000Z	euphorian	ActionParsnip	is it a gnome App?
2009-09-13T20:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	euphorian	maybe it doesnt like your ~/.mozilla directory. rename it then rerun the browser
2009-09-13T20:42:00.000Z	euphorian	ActionParsnip	no go
2009-09-13T20:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	euphorian	ok then rename it back
2009-09-13T20:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	euphorian	i just installed ot from: http://getswiftfox.com/deb.htm using the deb and its ok
2009-09-13T20:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	euphorian	didnt have to rename my profile either
2009-09-13T20:53:00.000Z	euphorian	ActionParsnip	Worked from .deb package
