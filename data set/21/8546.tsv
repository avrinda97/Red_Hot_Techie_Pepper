2006-04-28T05:47:00.000Z	volmarias		Hi, I'm having trouble trying to compile anything with GTK. I am told that the gtk/gtk.h include is not found. However, I'm pretty certain that I've installed GTK and gtk-dev
2006-04-28T05:47:00.000Z	volmarias		What should I do?
2006-04-28T05:47:00.000Z	biovore	volmarias	sudo apt-get install libgtk1.2-dev
2006-04-28T05:48:00.000Z	volmarias	biovore	it is already installed.
2006-04-28T05:49:00.000Z	biovore	volmarias	what are you tring to build?
2006-04-28T05:51:00.000Z	biovore	volmarias	not familuar with the toshiba tools..
2006-04-28T05:51:00.000Z	volmarias	biovore	it's irrelevant. Its the fact that including gtk/gtk.h doesn't work in the source
2006-04-28T05:51:00.000Z	volmarias	biovore	I suspect that if I tried to do the GTK hello world program, it would do just the same
2006-04-28T05:51:00.000Z	biovore	volmarias	is there a gtk.h in /usr/include/gtk?
2006-04-28T05:52:00.000Z	biovore	volmarias	the gtk/gtk.h  is in referance to /usr/include..  so might need a simlink or something
2006-04-28T05:53:00.000Z	volmarias	biovore	I'll give that a shot and let you know. Glad to have help instead of messageboards filled with "Go install gtk!"
2006-04-28T05:54:00.000Z	biovore	volmarias	like alot of code made by these hardware manufactures it fairly messed up..  probably dosn't get the correct information out of pkg-config for gtk
2006-04-28T05:54:00.000Z	volmarias	biovore	it's actually user created
2006-04-28T05:55:00.000Z	biovore	volmarias	is it giving you this error on ./configure?
2006-04-28T05:55:00.000Z	volmarias	biovore	I just hope that it'll actually do something for me. I'm sick of the absurdly long load times.
2006-04-28T05:55:00.000Z	volmarias	biovore	make depend.
2006-04-28T05:55:00.000Z	biovore	volmarias	hmm , sound like toshiba need to learn how to make configure files..
2006-04-28T05:56:00.000Z	volmarias	biovore	it's not toshiba, it's a "fan" created set of utils
2006-04-28T05:57:00.000Z	volmarias	biovore	)!(&*@!!^...
2006-04-28T05:57:00.000Z	biovore	volmarias	ok
2006-04-28T09:34:00.000Z	volmarias	biovore	if you're here, I get the feeling that you know this one :)
