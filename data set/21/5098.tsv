2008-12-27T11:51:00.000Z	nickrud	bashca	you have yourself in some groups you shouldn't be, uucp is one. The ones I listed are the ones that are set by default in intrepid. Ubuntu is trying to move away from using groups for hardware perms

2008-12-27T12:19:00.000Z	nickrud	bashca	dialout is the ppp user, if you're a member of that it should work. But I last used ppp several years ago, and am rusty
