2010-05-11T16:59:00.000Z	frustrated		why do you guys release 10.04 when it doesnt work?
2010-05-11T16:59:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	frustrated	It is working just fine for me, as does it for quite a lot of people.
2010-05-11T17:01:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	frustrated	perhaps some more info would be useful... will it not start? Does it not detect something? Don't you like the interface?
2010-05-11T17:02:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	frustrated	and if you try to start it via command line, will it load or error out?
2010-05-11T17:04:00.000Z	frustrated	s3r3n1t7	gnome-network-manager: command not found
2010-05-11T17:04:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	frustrated	hmm, a sec ... checking for the correct command
2010-05-11T17:06:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	frustrated	you're referring to the default network manager of the gnome desktop, correct? Then it's the network manager you're referring to specifically?
2010-05-11T17:07:00.000Z	frustrated	s3r3n1t7	yes
2010-05-11T17:07:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	frustrated	is the applet running in the right top of your screen? Run in a console ==> nm-applet (without the arrows, ofc)
2010-05-11T17:08:00.000Z	frustrated	s3r3n1t7	no, it's not running
2010-05-11T17:09:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	frustrated	and if you run nm-applet, what is the output?
2010-05-11T17:13:00.000Z	frustrated	s3r3n1t7	it loads in the upper right hand corner, and shows it as connected after i click connect, but pages wont load
2010-05-11T17:14:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	frustrated	and by pages I assume you mean a general webpage? How are you connected to the internet, via a cable or via wireless? Can you try to ping google.com for example?
2010-05-11T17:18:00.000Z	frustrated	s3r3n1t7	pings come back fine
2010-05-11T17:19:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	frustrated	then your web should be working just fine. Which page are you trying to show? Would it be possible this site is down?
2010-05-11T17:19:00.000Z	frustrated	s3r3n1t7	google.com, yahoo.com, msn.com
2010-05-11T17:20:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	frustrated	hmm ... yeah those sites are up. Have you tried a different browser? It would appear your web connection is working just fine.
2010-05-11T17:20:00.000Z	frustrated	s3r3n1t7	yes i have
2010-05-11T17:21:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	frustrated	then i'm afraid i'm at a loss. Considering that ping works but your browser doesn't, I don't see where the problem lies.
