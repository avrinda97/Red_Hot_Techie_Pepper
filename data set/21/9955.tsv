2005-06-09T08:22:00.000Z	adaran		i have a problem with evolution that is distro unrelated: version 2.0 and above do not work with my companies exchange server
2005-06-09T08:23:00.000Z	adaran		now here's my real problem: i want to install evolution 1.4 - however, i can't find it in  my repositories
2005-06-09T08:23:00.000Z	adaran		(using apt-cache search evolution) - is it still in the official repositories (evolution-1.4 is what i'm looking for)
2005-06-09T08:25:00.000Z	adaran		can anyone help me obtain evolution-1.4 packages?
2005-06-09T08:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adaran	evo 2 is pretty tightly integrated with gnome 2.10, I'd say
2005-06-09T08:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adaran	you may be out of luck
2005-06-09T08:26:00.000Z	adaran	thoreauputic	well yes, but it's broken, that's why i need 1.4
2005-06-09T08:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adaran	I understand
2005-06-09T08:26:00.000Z	adaran	thoreauputic	ah, damnit, it looks like evolution and gnome are going down the drain =/
2005-06-09T08:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adaran	I tend to agree, sadly - I use fluxbox or xfce4 mostly
2005-06-09T08:27:00.000Z	adaran	thoreauputic	well i usually get flamed when i say i use kde =)
2005-06-09T08:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adaran	I expect breezy will use the next version
2005-06-09T08:28:00.000Z	adaran	thoreauputic	well, what's the current version? i have to admit, i haven't been a 100% - i don't use ubuntu, but debian rather, but i'm helping a colleague out - he's having the same problems i have, they are ubuntu related, and i just need ubuntu/apt to install 1.4
2005-06-09T08:28:00.000Z	adaran	thoreauputic	though, i might add, i'm a candidate for ubuntu if debian doesn't drop some archs and hurry up with sarge =)
2005-06-09T08:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adaran	I don't know enough to help with evo 1.4.*, sorry
2005-06-09T08:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adaran	maybe someone else will know - tried the mailing list?
2005-06-09T08:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adaran	using debian repos is deprecated ....
2005-06-09T08:31:00.000Z	adaran	thoreauputic	so it's compiling from source for 1.4? :P
2005-06-09T08:31:00.000Z	adaran	thoreauputic	i wouldn't mind having both installed
2005-06-09T08:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	adaran	I guess you could try it as a test and see if it breaks?
2005-06-09T08:32:00.000Z	adaran	thoreauputic	ah well it's not that important i guess
