2010-06-02T21:52:00.000Z	microbalrog		Hello
2010-06-02T21:52:00.000Z	microbalrog		I have a small problem with the unrar program
2010-06-02T21:53:00.000Z	microbalrog		it claims that any .rar files it tries to open are empty
2010-06-02T21:53:00.000Z	microbalrog		and when it is ordered to extract them just creates an empty folder
2010-06-02T21:53:00.000Z	microbalrog		and names it after the file
2010-06-02T21:53:00.000Z	microbalrog		what to do, what to do?
2010-06-02T21:55:00.000Z	comag	microbalrog	maybe the unrar shipped with ubuntu is unable to read your rars
2010-06-02T21:55:00.000Z	microbalrog		<comag> microbalrog: maybe the unrar shipped with ubuntu is unable to read your rars <- it didn't ship with Ubuntu
2010-06-02T21:55:00.000Z	microbalrog		I installed it
2010-06-02T21:55:00.000Z	comag	microbalrog	then you installed the wrong ;)
2010-06-02T21:56:00.000Z	microbalrog		which is the right, then?
2010-06-02T21:56:00.000Z	comag	microbalrog	there are an open source implementation and a closed source binary which is better
2010-06-02T21:57:00.000Z	microbalrog		is  sudo apt-get install unrar the right one?
2010-06-02T21:58:00.000Z	microbalrog		I installed that soreau
2010-06-02T21:58:00.000Z	comag	microbalrog	http://rarlab.com/download.htm
2010-06-02T21:59:00.000Z	microbalrog	soreau	and yet I can't actually install rar archives
2010-06-02T22:01:00.000Z	microbalrog		yes that's what I meant
2010-06-02T22:01:00.000Z	microbalrog		sorau: what I mean is I already installed unrar, or at least Terminal is telling me that
2010-06-02T22:01:00.000Z	microbalrog		sorau: and yet clicking on any .rar files just claims the archives have no files in them
2010-06-02T22:02:00.000Z	microbalrog	soreau	which is untrue as I have several different archives tht several other people have used them successfully
2010-06-02T22:02:00.000Z	comag	microbalrog	try it via command line
