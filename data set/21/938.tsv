2011-05-03T17:14:00.000Z	thegoodcushion		I find that in 10.04 I have the su command and none of my passwords work with it.  1) Is su officially supported now?  2)  Why don't my passwords work?
2011-05-03T17:16:00.000Z	thegoodcushion		crikey*
2011-05-03T17:16:00.000Z	thegoodcushion		How do I know how much RAM it's using?
2011-05-03T17:16:00.000Z	nanomad	thegoodcushion	free -m
2011-05-03T17:16:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	nanomad	Looks like I have 3.5 gigs
2011-05-03T17:17:00.000Z	nanomad	thegoodcushion	32bit os?
2011-05-03T17:17:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	nanomad	Yeah 32 bit OS on a 64 bit CPU
2011-05-03T17:17:00.000Z	nanomad	thegoodcushion	videocard?
2011-05-03T17:17:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	nanomad	discrete nvidia
2011-05-03T17:18:00.000Z	nanomad	thegoodcushion	on 32bit OS part of the address space is used to address devices such as the GPU
2011-05-03T17:18:00.000Z	nanomad	thegoodcushion	so 3.5 gigs is normal
2011-05-03T17:19:00.000Z	nanomad	thegoodcushion	you should use a 64bit OS if you need the extra 500Mb
2011-05-03T17:28:00.000Z	nanomad	thegoodcushion	not everyone wants PAE
2011-05-03T17:29:00.000Z	nanomad	thegoodcushion	of course
2011-05-03T17:29:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	nanomad	So what do I do?  Run in text mode?
2011-05-03T17:31:00.000Z	nanomad	thegoodcushion	you could have built the driver manually using dkms ;)
2011-05-03T17:31:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	nanomad	Homey don't play that
2011-05-03T17:35:00.000Z	nanomad	thegoodcushion	what's the error?
2011-05-03T17:36:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	nanomad	On boot up I get a screen saying drivers gave an error
2011-05-03T17:39:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	nanomad	why are you saying that?
2011-05-03T17:40:00.000Z	nanomad	thegoodcushion	nvidia+intel+how switching = nvidia driver not working
