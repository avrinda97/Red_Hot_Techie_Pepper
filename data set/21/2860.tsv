2010-01-30T19:41:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Bash	google for 'compiz-check' and use it to debug compiz for you
2010-01-30T19:44:00.000Z	Bash	mkanyicy	its saying everything is ok
2010-01-30T19:44:00.000Z	Bash	mkanyicy	but its not working...

2010-01-30T19:55:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Bash	the commandline ' cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep AIGLX' is equivalent to ' grep AIGLX /var/log/Xorg.0.log'
