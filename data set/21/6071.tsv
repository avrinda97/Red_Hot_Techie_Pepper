2007-06-13T09:04:00.000Z	rbil	MacDrunk	you need to create a samba user
2007-06-13T09:23:00.000Z	rbil	MacDrunk	and you are sharing a directory on your Linux box?
2007-06-13T09:23:00.000Z	MacDrunk	rbil	yes
2007-06-13T09:24:00.000Z	rbil	MacDrunk	and you've created a user/password pair for samba?
2007-06-13T09:25:00.000Z	rbil	MacDrunk	have u restarted samba server since creating password?
2007-06-13T09:28:00.000Z	rbil	MacDrunk	restart samba server .... sudo /etc/init.d/smb restart
