2009-11-20T09:11:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Hey guys have they fixed the annoyances with installing kde alongside gnome, kinda like some kde logos/screens etc override the system?
2009-11-20T09:12:00.000Z	puff	linuxguy2009	As of earlier this week, I believe "no"
2009-11-20T09:12:00.000Z	puff	linuxguy2009	I was helping somebody sort out a problem where we had installed gnome desktop and then they wanted kde, then they upgraded to karmic.
2009-11-20T09:12:00.000Z	puff	linuxguy2009	and kxm and gdm were fighting, so they could'nt use xdmcp.
2009-11-20T09:12:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	puff	thank you
2009-11-20T09:12:00.000Z	puff	linuxguy2009	So, I'm not certainyl what problems exactly you were worried about, but it appears that one isn't solved yet.
2009-11-21T06:13:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	puff	CTRL+ALT+DEL to bring up the shutdown menu. Choose suspend.
2009-11-21T06:13:00.000Z	puff	linuxguy2009	That only gives me "log out" and "Switch usre"
2009-11-21T06:14:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	puff	What version of Ubuntu?
2009-11-21T06:15:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	puff	ALT+F1 over to system, prefs, keyboard shortcuts. Set your own keystroke for suspend.
2009-11-21T06:15:00.000Z	puff	linuxguy2009	Ah,http://www.objectivistcenter.org/cth--1782-blink_think.aspx neat.
2009-11-21T06:17:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	puff	Did I miss something? Whats the article?
2009-11-21T06:17:00.000Z	puff	linuxguy2009	Which?
2009-11-21T06:17:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	puff	linuxguy2009: Ah,http://www.objectivistcenter.org/cth--1782-blink_think.aspx neat.
2009-11-21T06:18:00.000Z	puff	linuxguy2009	Oops, sorry, that was a miskey.  Interesting review, though.
2009-11-21T06:18:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	puff	hehe thats ok
2009-11-21T06:20:00.000Z	puff	linuxguy2009	Dangit, the suspend doesn't appear to work. Hm.
2009-11-21T06:20:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	puff	What did you set the shortcut to?
2009-11-21T06:20:00.000Z	puff	linuxguy2009	alt-pause.
2009-11-21T06:21:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	puff	try another one besides pause maybe unusable. Try something simple first to see if it works. Then change it later.
2009-11-21T06:21:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	puff	ctrl+alt+s for example
