2011-08-09T17:07:00.000Z	Tophen		On extremely slow.... Anything I can do?
2011-08-09T17:08:00.000Z	Tophen		How?
2011-08-09T17:08:00.000Z	Tophen		Sorry I'm new to linux.
2011-08-09T17:09:00.000Z	Tophen		Oh god what have I gotten myself into.
2011-08-09T17:10:00.000Z	Tophen		Look. I started a format on my external 500gb format from fat32 to EXT4. I accidentally did it on 1.0.
2011-08-09T17:10:00.000Z	Tophen		Ok.
2011-08-09T17:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Tophen	what's the issue ?
2011-08-09T17:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Tophen	how did you start it on usb1 speed ?
2011-08-09T17:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Tophen	I believe that's not correct
2011-08-09T17:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Tophen	the mkfs command does not have an option for "USB speed"
2011-08-09T17:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Tophen	just let it run,
2011-08-09T17:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Tophen	unknown, it depends on a lot of things
2011-08-09T17:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Tophen	just let it run,
2011-08-09T17:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Tophen	tell you waht then - power off the machine
2011-08-09T17:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Tophen	you don't seem to want to hear advice, so just unplug it and walk away
2011-08-09T17:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Tophen	you had no idea how long it will take, and your making comments like "this will take years" how do you know if you have no idea how long it will take
2011-08-09T17:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Tophen	then calm down and stop talking nonsense, and listen to people trying to help you
