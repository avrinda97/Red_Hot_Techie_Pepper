2010-07-10T00:34:00.000Z	hylian		hello all i am running ubuntu 10.04 lts amd 64 version. is there another option for me besides sun java which is apparently not available?
2010-07-10T00:36:00.000Z	hylian		why doesnt ubuntu's synaptic offer sun java for amd 64 bit machines, when it exists (am currently downloading it via sun's website...)?
2010-07-10T00:38:00.000Z	trism	hylian	it is in the partner repo
2010-07-22T21:38:00.000Z	trism	hylian	java -jar file.jar
2010-07-22T21:39:00.000Z	hylian	trism	thanx ill try that
2010-07-22T21:41:00.000Z	hylian	trism	it opens with openjdk instead of sun's jdk, which gives the game weird sound errors. is there a way to differentiate, or can i just uninstall openjdk>
2010-07-22T21:42:00.000Z	trism	hylian	if you have sun-java you should probably remove openjdk, but you could specify the absolute path to the correct java binary
2010-07-22T21:43:00.000Z	hylian	trism	i appreciate that, but since i did not install openjdk, im assuming a program i installed did. hmm. where would those bimaries be?
2010-07-22T21:46:00.000Z	trism	hylian	dpkg -L sun-java6-jdk; and look for the java binary
2010-07-22T21:48:00.000Z	trism	hylian	actually it is probably in sun-java6-bin
2010-07-22T21:53:00.000Z	hylian	trism	thank you bye!
2011-06-28T06:44:00.000Z	trism	hylian	you can't run gnome-terminal without x, you can create a new .desktop file in /usr/share/xsessions copying the xterm.desktop and replace the references to xterm with gnome-terminal and log into that
2011-06-28T06:45:00.000Z	hylian	trism	i want to run x. please read the entire stream, thank you.
2011-06-28T06:45:00.000Z	trism	hylian	oh sorry, I misread that
2011-06-28T06:46:00.000Z	hylian	trism	great idea! i think i'll try that!
2011-06-28T07:01:00.000Z	hylian	trism	works like a charm, or should i say "working" like a charm, thanks!
2011-06-28T07:33:00.000Z	hylian	trism	this is working perfect! :)
2011-06-28T07:38:00.000Z	trism	hylian	glad to hear it
2011-08-18T22:39:00.000Z	trism	hylian	flashplugin-nonfree is just a transitional package that installs flashplugin-installer
2011-08-18T22:40:00.000Z	hylian	trism	hmm, interesting. i have had better luck with the nonfree version, but i can sum that up as dumb luck too.
2012-07-14T00:25:00.000Z	trism	hylian	could try: https://launchpad.net/classicmenu-indicator
