2007-07-21T16:57:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude		I downloaded a package from the synaptic called "Desktop Search" which adds a little magnifying glass to my panel that allows search. Am I under the right impression that it does not search the entire file system, but only the home directory?
2007-07-21T05:07:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude		What's the best way to search for a file throughout the entire file system -- through the GUI not terminal ?
2007-07-21T05:08:00.000Z	arso	Newbie_Dude	 places, search for a file?
2007-07-21T05:08:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	arso	cool didn't know that was there, thanks
2007-07-21T05:09:00.000Z	arso	Newbie_Dude	 np
2007-07-21T05:40:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	arso	exaile is an MP3 player similar to iTunes but less bloated and cooler. :) It is the gnome equivelant of Amarok
2007-07-21T05:40:00.000Z	arso	Newbie_Dude	 oh , do you recommend it?
2007-07-21T05:40:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	arso	i'm using it right now, so far it is the best i've found for Ubuntu. I think I got mine from www.getdeb.net
2007-07-21T05:41:00.000Z	arso	Newbie_Dude	 great, isnt it available through synaptic?
2007-07-21T05:41:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	arso	it is but an earlier version... www.getdeb.net I believe has a later version. Synaptic programs are updated once every 6 months, at the same time as the new Ubuntu versions are released.
2007-07-21T05:42:00.000Z	arso	Newbie_Dude	 ah, and isnt there a command to check for updates for already installed programs ors omething?
2007-07-21T05:42:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	arso	no idea
2007-07-21T05:43:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	arso	0.2.8? I'm using 0.2.9.. No idea about synaptic, I got mine from www.getdeb.net
2007-07-21T05:44:00.000Z	arso	Newbie_Dude	 yea i found .9 on getdeb
2007-07-21T05:45:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	arso	Getdeb.net is nice because it allows newbies like myself to easily install programs, just double-click and it installs.
2007-07-21T05:45:00.000Z	arso	Newbie_Dude	 oh , nice, i thought id be complicated
2007-07-21T05:46:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	arso	any file that has the ".DEB" at the end is already packaged. So you double-click and it'll download any needed dependencies. :) I wouldn't make you download some version you had to compile. ;) I can't even do that myself.
2007-07-21T05:46:00.000Z	arso	Newbie_Dude	 great,
2007-07-21T05:46:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	arso	25, but ask in #ubuntu-offtopic for that kind of thing :)
2007-07-21T05:50:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	arso	personally i'd get rid of amarok first (i'm a freak like that) but it won't affect performance
2007-07-21T05:50:00.000Z	arso	Newbie_Dude	 i see, i would remove it anyway, dont want unwanted apps
