2007-03-22T09:22:00.000Z	gatekeep		ev64: if you need to be bailed out of trouble i might be around
2007-03-22T09:23:00.000Z	gatekeep		ev64: features?? comes with Compviz and crap by default, Xorg 7.1 i have to check a bunch of crap been playing like mad ... too much to list really
2007-03-22T09:23:00.000Z	bruenig	gatekeep	are you sure by default, I read they backed off on that by default, easy to enable, but not default
2007-03-22T09:25:00.000Z	bruenig	gatekeep	yeah it says composite by default was deferred, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/composite-by-default
2007-03-22T09:26:00.000Z	gatekeep	bruenig	interesting cuz Herd 5 still has the compositing manager
2007-03-22T09:26:00.000Z	bruenig	gatekeep	however, accelerated x is enabled. So presumably installing compiz and beryl should be simple
2007-03-22T09:26:00.000Z	gatekeep	bruenig	they may have turned of Composite from the way it was defaulted on but im not sure, due to my ATI situation i need it off anyway
2007-03-22T09:27:00.000Z	gatekeep	bruenig	accelerated X ... is nice but im stuck with Xgl which isn't too bad
2007-03-22T09:27:00.000Z	bruenig	gatekeep	ok, well anyways no compiz and beryl
2007-03-22T09:28:00.000Z	gatekeep	bruenig	hmmm ... well must be just Herd 5 that comes with it default
2007-03-22T09:28:00.000Z	bruenig	gatekeep	did you try herd 5
2007-03-22T09:28:00.000Z	gatekeep	bruenig	i mean it is installed default but not enabled
2007-03-22T09:28:00.000Z	gatekeep	bruenig	i have Herd 4 and 5 on disc
2007-03-22T09:28:00.000Z	bruenig	gatekeep	well seems odd that it would be deferred and be on those disks
2007-03-22T09:28:00.000Z	gatekeep	bruenig	this laptop im on was installed Herd 5 and had compiz installed
2007-03-22T09:29:00.000Z	gatekeep	bruenig	who knows ... but its easy enough to install
