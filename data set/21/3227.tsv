2009-02-25T04:06:00.000Z	brandonp		hey guys, quick question. is there a way to resize the default window size for applications, because a lot of windows that I open are too big, meaning they go below the lower taskbar

2009-02-25T04:09:00.000Z	brandonp		max res that my netbook alows
2009-02-25T04:09:00.000Z	brandonp		allows
2009-02-25T04:09:00.000Z	brandonp		no jack_sparrow, its intrepid
2009-02-25T04:10:00.000Z	brandonp		no, its 1024x600 actually
2009-02-25T04:11:00.000Z	brandonp		jack_sparrow, this happened when I activated special effects for windows. such as making them shake when I drag them etc
2009-02-25T04:13:00.000Z	brandonp		jack_sparrow its 1024x600 16:9
2009-02-25T04:14:00.000Z	brandonp		jack_sparrow Its not compiz , the effects are stock on intrepid under appearance tabs
2009-02-25T04:14:00.000Z	brandonp		ohhhh sorry, didn't know it was compiz
2009-02-25T04:14:00.000Z	hmw	brandonp	- you can move windows by holding ALT and clicking somwhere in the window
2009-02-25T04:15:00.000Z	brandonp	hmw	, compiz disables window resizing i think
2009-02-25T04:15:00.000Z	hmw	brandonp	- do you still see the title and border (close buttons, etc)=
2009-02-25T04:16:00.000Z	brandonp	hmw	yea the top is perfect, the windows are oversized at the bottom they run below the bottom taskbar
2009-02-25T04:18:00.000Z	brandonp	hmw	for example i cant resize the window that comes out here on x=chat.. when i click on edit, preferences
2009-02-25T04:18:00.000Z	hmw	brandonp	- then i think, your only chance is the ALT+DRAG trick, to see the buttons on th bottom
2009-02-25T04:20:00.000Z	hmw	brandonp	- i didnt follow your earlier conversation here. if disabling compiz would help, i would be very surprised. or did you want to disable something else?
2009-02-25T04:21:00.000Z	brandonp	hmw	yea well i guess its compiz, im talking about when you click on system preferences appearance effects, then you check the special effects
2009-02-25T04:21:00.000Z	brandonp	hmw	if i click on standard effects, then the windows are fine, if i click on enhanced effects, then the windows are oversized
2009-02-25T04:22:00.000Z	hmw	brandonp	- well that sounds like compiz :) if it is really compiz, you could try to install compiz-settings-manager and tweak the thing, until it behaves. good luck!
2009-02-25T04:25:00.000Z	hmw	brandonp	- its strange, because my compiz doesnt change window sizes. there should be a chance, to "repair" this. ask in #compiz, as it seems to be an uncommon issue. Only thing, I could think of, would be compiz changing screen resolution.
