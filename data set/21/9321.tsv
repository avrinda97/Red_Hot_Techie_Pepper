2007-12-29T05:53:00.000Z	Jan`		That is an interesting idea though.
2007-12-29T05:53:00.000Z	Jan`		Especially if... it can write to NTFS disks?
2007-12-29T05:54:00.000Z	Jan`		Oooo.
2007-12-29T05:54:00.000Z	Jan`		Since when was the NTFS write support not "highly experimental?"
2007-12-29T05:55:00.000Z	Jan`		Christ on a bike
2007-12-29T05:55:00.000Z	Jan`		Do you speak English?
2007-12-29T05:56:00.000Z	Jan`		What on earth did I say that wasn't family friendly, anyway?
2007-12-29T05:57:00.000Z	Jan`		I'm googling for info here and I keep finding lines like this: ppc-sources-benh-2.4-21-r2 has hfsplus support in kernel.
2007-12-29T05:57:00.000Z	Jan`		What does that actually mean?
2007-12-29T05:58:00.000Z	Jan`		I mean they're talking about Gentoo there, I think, but does that mean it supports it or not?
2007-12-29T05:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Jan`	 its inlcuded. :) i guess you can say.
2007-12-29T06:07:00.000Z	Jan`	Dr_willis	I assume it needs some sort of disk to work on.
2007-12-29T06:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Jan`	 the live cd? Nope - it dosent.
2007-12-29T06:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Jan`	 I use them in mechines with no HD at all.
2007-12-29T06:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Jan`	 if thats the case - then yoyu SHOULD have backups allready.
2007-12-29T06:15:00.000Z	Jan`	Dr_willis	We do, in a way, but it's a major PITA to restore the data.
2007-12-29T06:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Jan`	 what sort of Guarentee do you want...  If you are that paranoid then use a test machine.
2007-12-29T06:16:00.000Z	Jan`	Dr_willis	Good idea.
2007-12-29T06:17:00.000Z	Jan`	Dr_willis	The issue is that it's a video edit station with several jobs on it. Those jobs can be restored using edit decision lists from the original video tape.
2007-12-29T06:17:00.000Z	Jan`	Dr_willis	Hell yes.
2007-12-29T06:18:00.000Z	Jan`	Dr_willis	I'll do it on the office PC.
