2009-12-25T06:47:00.000Z	neezer		is there a conky channel?
2009-12-25T06:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 not that ive noticed.. but the homepage/forums are very good for conky
2009-12-25T06:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 its a neat tool.. and very annoying in many ways. :)
2009-12-25T06:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 that shouldent be too hard.
2009-12-25T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 conky can do that. of course tehres non-conky ways of monitoring a log file also
2010-02-14T07:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 perhaps #networking
2010-02-14T07:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 dns is what looks up www.whatever.com to the ip it actually is
2010-02-14T07:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 not sure what you are trying to do exactly. but i bet its not got a lot to do with 'dns'
2010-02-14T07:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 the 'dynamic dns' service - lets your clients update a web site with their current ip. so yo can always find them from the internet  - but thats a specific service/tool running
2010-02-14T07:06:00.000Z	neezer	Dr_Willis	I guess I don't even know what that means....
2010-02-14T07:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 check out 'dyndns' or other tools.
2010-02-14T07:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 a dynamic dns client/service lets you do that IF the machines are set up right
2010-02-14T07:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 then you setup a webserver and let them acccess it.
2010-02-14T07:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 its much easier to just use a site like dropbox, or ubuntuone, or similer
2010-02-14T07:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 you are not running services on your pc you dont need.. = safer
2010-02-14T07:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 yes. Go read up at the Dyndns web site. :)
2010-02-14T07:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 thers other services that do a similer thing, DynDNS is just a common/big one
2010-02-14T07:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 your router has to set up port forwarding  yes.
2010-02-14T07:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 and forward other ports.
2010-02-14T07:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 This DOES open up your pc to potential attacks. thats why i dont use it.
2010-02-14T07:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	neezer	 this is why we are saying using dropbox or other services is safer way to get files to other people
