2007-03-27T06:50:00.000Z	neozen	tomw1	lol... you had to use ndiswrapper to get it working
2007-03-27T06:51:00.000Z	neozen	tomw1	you said it was prism2 based
2007-03-27T06:51:00.000Z	neozen	tomw1	shouldn't have to use ndis for prism2 's
2007-03-27T06:51:00.000Z	neozen	tomw1	but if it works... and it works reliably...
2007-03-27T06:52:00.000Z	neozen	tomw1	so you didn't use ndiswrapper?
2007-03-27T06:52:00.000Z	neozen	tomw1	I'm confuzzled
