2009-02-02T22:41:00.000Z	woernsn		hey there.. can anybody help me with my grub-problem..?
2009-02-02T22:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woernsn	What is your grub problem
2009-02-02T22:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woernsn	Keep questions all on one line so I can read more easilly
2009-02-02T22:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woernsn	Did you just reinstall windows
2009-02-02T22:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woernsn	Are you running livecd on the problem system now
2009-02-02T22:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woernsn	Is this a real install or was it a wubi install from inside windows
2009-02-02T22:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woernsn	Are you running livecd on the problem system now
2009-02-02T22:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woernsn	You will need a livecd in order to fix this
2009-02-02T22:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woernsn	Sure.. all on one line
2009-02-02T22:49:00.000Z	woernsn	Jack_Sparrow	yesterday everything went right but when i started my system today again it says in grub "Debian GNU/Linux, kernel 2.6.27-11-generic" instead of "Ubuntu 8.10, kernel 2.6.27-11-generic". And when my computer tries to boot it it just says "Error 11: Unrecognized device string. Press any key to continue..."
2009-02-02T22:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woernsn	Looks like you tried to insall another nix.. still cant be fixed without a livecd
2009-02-02T22:51:00.000Z	woernsn	Jack_Sparrow	i just wanted you to know ;) i will be back in few minutes with a livecd
2009-02-02T22:57:00.000Z	woernsn	Jack_Sparrow	so i'm back again
2009-02-02T22:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woernsn	Livecd and you can open a terminal
2009-02-02T22:58:00.000Z	woernsn	Jack_Sparrow	yes
2009-02-02T22:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woernsn	ONe sec, I have a long command for you to paste
2009-02-02T22:58:00.000Z	woernsn	Jack_Sparrow	oke.. i'll be patient ;)
2009-02-02T22:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woernsn	sudo apt-get install pastebinit  && cp /etc/fstab ~/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt && sudo fdisk -l >> ~/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt && sudo blkid >> ~/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt && lsb_release -a >> ~/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt && cat /boot/grub/menu.lst >> ~/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt && cat /home/$USER/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt | pastebinit  (Provide Pastebin link in channel)
2009-02-02T23:00:00.000Z	woernsn	Jack_Sparrow	No LSB modules are available.
2009-02-02T23:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	woernsn	YOu need to run those commands against the hard drive not from the live part of the session.. I am also running out of time
