2008-07-15T03:39:00.000Z	Ziggy		Anyone know where I can find a xorg file that isn't modified.
2008-07-15T03:39:00.000Z	Reformer81	Ziggy	In the backup you should have made before changing the original.
2008-07-15T03:40:00.000Z	Ziggy		Yea exactly I was given someone elses xorg to configure my graphics driver, because my resolution was messed up.
2008-07-15T03:40:00.000Z	Ziggy		So I have a feeling it's why I can't boot from CD
2008-07-15T03:40:00.000Z	Reformer81	Ziggy	If you need to recreate it, however, just run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-07-15T03:41:00.000Z	Ziggy		Reformer8: Will that fix it?
2008-07-15T03:41:00.000Z	Ziggy		just type that in terminal?
2008-07-15T03:41:00.000Z	Reformer81	Ziggy	It's possible.
2008-07-15T03:41:00.000Z	Ziggy		Thanks, I'll try
2008-07-15T03:43:00.000Z	Ziggy		Reformer8: Not much happened there it was just some "keyboard" config
2008-07-15T03:43:00.000Z	Ziggy	xxploit	?
2008-07-15T03:44:00.000Z	Reformer81	Ziggy	If you go through the whole thing, it should also configure your mouse and video driver
2008-07-15T03:44:00.000Z	Ziggy		I did
2008-07-15T03:45:00.000Z	Ziggy		Reformer8: This is what happened afterwards, xserver-xorg postinst warning: overwriting possibly-customised configuration
2008-07-15T03:45:00.000Z	Ziggy		   file; backup in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.20080714174235
2008-07-15T03:45:00.000Z	Reformer81	Ziggy	Right... go through it.
2008-07-15T03:45:00.000Z	Reformer81	Ziggy	You may need to do it with sudo.
2008-07-15T03:45:00.000Z	Ziggy		I did
2008-07-15T03:46:00.000Z	Ziggy		Man I give up
2008-07-15T03:47:00.000Z	Reformer81	Ziggy	Well, next time, always make a backup of any configuration files you change.
2008-07-15T03:47:00.000Z	Reformer81	Ziggy	Not only should it be common sense, it should also be a part of ANY tutorial you follow online.
