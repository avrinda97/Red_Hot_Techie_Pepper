2011-01-21T21:28:00.000Z	abstrakt		ok, serious issues... I did an ubuntu system update and now my system is fucked
2011-01-21T21:28:00.000Z	abstrakt		I can still boot in to windows, but Ubuntu is giving me error messages
2011-01-21T21:28:00.000Z	SA-Geoff	abstrakt	how far does the boot process get?
2011-01-21T21:28:00.000Z	abstrakt	SA-Geoff	depends on which kernel I select
2011-01-21T21:29:00.000Z	SA-Geoff	abstrakt	if you select the previous kernel does it boot all the way?
2011-01-21T21:29:00.000Z	abstrakt	SA-Geoff	atually no, that's what's so concerning, it dumps me to the (initramfs) prompt
2011-01-21T21:30:00.000Z	SA-Geoff	abstrakt	are you running stock ubuntu or are you running one that requires a different kernel such as ubuntu studio or perhaps running xen vm?
2011-01-21T21:30:00.000Z	abstrakt	SA-Geoff	stock
2011-01-21T21:30:00.000Z	abstrakt	SA-Geoff	I run Ardour and stuff but I don't have linux-rt
2011-01-21T21:30:00.000Z	abstrakt	SA-Geoff	I don't bother with installing "Studio" or "K-Ubuntu" I just install vanilla Ubuntu and then install other packages if I want them
2011-01-21T21:33:00.000Z	SA-Geoff	abstrakt	is there any way you can access /etc/fstab ?
2011-01-21T21:34:00.000Z	SA-Geoff	abstrakt	i doubt it
2011-01-21T21:35:00.000Z	SA-Geoff	abstrakt	can you access /etc/fstab ?
2011-01-21T21:45:00.000Z	abstrakt	SA-Geoff	ok well my previous nix still boots... I've been running 10.10 for a month or two now
2011-01-21T21:46:00.000Z	abstrakt	SA-Geoff	so I'm in 10.04 and I have access to the 10.10 partition, so how should I go about diagnosing this?
2011-01-21T21:46:00.000Z	SA-Geoff	abstrakt	are you using ext4?
2011-01-21T21:46:00.000Z	abstrakt	SA-Geoff	hrm, not absolutely sure
2011-01-21T21:46:00.000Z	abstrakt	SA-Geoff	actually don't think so, but it's possible... I'm using whatever the default was for 10.10
2011-01-21T21:46:00.000Z	SA-Geoff	abstrakt	i'd back up your files onto the 10.04 and reinstall.  something horrible has happened on that system
2011-01-21T21:47:00.000Z	SA-Geoff	abstrakt	the time it would take to recover it will be much longer than backing up and reinstalling
2011-01-21T21:48:00.000Z	abstrakt	SA-Geoff	tripple sunnuva... either amount of time is time I don't have :(
