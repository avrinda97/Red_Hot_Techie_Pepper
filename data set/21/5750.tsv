2007-08-14T14:51:00.000Z	Rasimu		Hi, i'm trying to run my sshd on my ubuntu. I succeed conecting to the localhost from the same computer using ssh but when trying to reach it from other computers on the lan I get a connection refused error
2007-08-14T14:51:00.000Z	Rasimu		any ideas?
2007-08-14T14:52:00.000Z	Jin	Rasimu	you need to open a port for ssh
2007-08-14T14:52:00.000Z	Jin	Rasimu	should be port number 22
2007-08-14T14:52:00.000Z	Rasimu		Jim: how do I do that?
2007-08-14T14:53:00.000Z	Rasimu		How can I check if the 22 port is closed?
2007-08-14T14:53:00.000Z	Jin	Rasimu	it is closed by default
2007-08-14T14:54:00.000Z	Rasimu	Jin	so where should I configure this?
2007-08-14T14:54:00.000Z	Jin	Rasimu	try the application called firestarter
2007-08-14T14:55:00.000Z	Jin	Rasimu	firestarter is a tool for you to configure the firewall
2007-08-14T14:56:00.000Z	Rasimu	Jin	is it a command line util?
2007-08-14T14:56:00.000Z	Jin	Rasimu	a GUI
2007-08-14T14:56:00.000Z	Rasimu	Jin	hmm I don't have a gui on that box
2007-08-14T14:57:00.000Z	Jin	Rasimu	then you need a shell script
2007-08-14T14:57:00.000Z	Jin	Rasimu	do a search on Kiss my firewall using google
2007-08-14T14:57:00.000Z	Rasimu	Jin	but you guess it's a firewall thingy?
2007-08-14T14:57:00.000Z	Jin	Rasimu	it is a very easy shell script to config your firewall
2007-08-14T14:57:00.000Z	Jin	Rasimu	yea
2007-08-14T14:57:00.000Z	Rasimu	Jin	thanks a lot
2007-08-14T14:57:00.000Z	Rasimu	Jin	will check it out
2007-08-14T14:58:00.000Z	Jin	Rasimu	if you have the port open on your ubuntu and still can't ssh into it, check your router/switch
