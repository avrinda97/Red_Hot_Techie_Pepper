2010-04-27T06:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	goddard	what did you install that messed with java?
2010-04-27T06:12:00.000Z	goddard	Scunizi	gcj
2010-04-27T06:13:00.000Z	goddard	Scunizi	gcj
2010-04-27T06:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	goddard	gcj ?? what's that?
2010-04-27T06:15:00.000Z	goddard	Scunizi	gcj is a exe builder for java that is horrible
2010-04-27T06:16:00.000Z	Scunizi	goddard	ah.. now I remember.. uninstall that "offending" program if it isn't already gone then use synaptic to reinstall sun-java6- jre  should fix things up..
2010-04-27T06:17:00.000Z	goddard	Scunizi	alright will give it a go
2010-04-27T06:22:00.000Z	goddard	Scunizi	it is still giving me the gcj reference even after reinstalling sun-java6-jre is that the only installs I should of used?
2010-04-27T06:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	goddard	wild shot in the dark here.. but even after uninstalling a program the configuration file is typically left behind in your home directory as a hidden directory.. open nautilus and ctrl+h to reveal hidden stuff and search for gcj or .gcj
2010-04-27T06:25:00.000Z	goddard	Scunizi	ok will give it a go
2010-04-27T06:27:00.000Z	goddard	Scunizi	found it in usr/lib and deleted that but nothing in my home directory but still same issue
2010-04-27T06:27:00.000Z	Scunizi	goddard	it's got something someplace.. was this program in the repos or from some 3rd party?
2010-04-27T06:28:00.000Z	goddard	Scunizi	third party
2010-04-27T06:28:00.000Z	goddard	Scunizi	but i got it from the repos i mean
2010-04-27T06:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	goddard	repos wouldn't be 3rd party.. how did you uninstall? synaptic?
2010-04-27T06:30:00.000Z	goddard	Scunizi	synaptic
2010-04-27T06:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	goddard	try a "sudo apt-get autoremove" .. probably won't make a difference.. you might have to file a bug about this one.. also check the ubuntuforums.org for more info.
2010-04-27T06:33:00.000Z	goddard	Scunizi	did that and it removed some things, but still same error
2010-04-27T06:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	goddard	I'm stuck.. maybe someone with more experience in that area can help.. sorry but I've run out of ideas.
2010-04-27T06:34:00.000Z	goddard	Scunizi	thanks though
