2011-05-16T02:05:00.000Z	daniel_		ok so i changed my splash screen is there anyway to change the startup sound
2011-05-16T02:06:00.000Z	coz_	daniel_	 not easily even if at all.. there was a point before natty was even on t he board that a gui tool was going to be developed for this,, I assume you mean those darn bongos ...yes?
2011-05-16T02:06:00.000Z	daniel_	coz_	yes i hate them lol but im using 10.10 if that makes things esier?
2011-05-16T02:07:00.000Z	coz_	daniel_	 no it doesnt make it easier,, the last three from 10.04 to 11.04  it is a pain in the rear and last I tired it screwed things up
2011-05-16T02:07:00.000Z	coz_	daniel_	 you can shut it of under system/preferences/ startup applications  ..I believe th e log in sound is listed there
2011-05-16T02:08:00.000Z	coz_	daniel_	rathere shut it off
2011-05-16T02:08:00.000Z	daniel_	coz_	damn haha my friends allways make fun of my laptop cause they say it sounds ancient so ive been working on finding ways to make ubuntu not look so old lol found this overglossed theme witch helps lol but that damn sound ill try to just shut if off like u said
2011-05-16T02:09:00.000Z	coz_	daniel_	 I understand :)
2011-05-16T02:13:00.000Z	daniel_	coz_	hey i found this you think it will work with 10.10 ?http://ubuntulinux.co.in/blog/ubuntu/ubuntu-9-10/startup-sound-changing-in-ubuntu-9-10-karmic/
2011-05-16T02:14:00.000Z	coz_	daniel_	  never tried that one,, cant hurt I suppose ;)
2011-05-16T02:15:00.000Z	daniel_	coz_	ok just wanted a second opinion before i did it and something be changed in 10.10 and i screw my system up cause i almost have it perfect for me
2011-05-16T02:16:00.000Z	coz_	daniel_	 it might be safer just to disable the sound
2011-05-16T02:16:00.000Z	daniel_	coz_	hmm yeh no reason to fool with something so little
2011-05-16T02:16:00.000Z	coz_	daniel_	 I have not tested this and dont want to say that it will work,, it should  but I would put the sound in the location of the default sound
2011-05-16T02:17:00.000Z	coz_	daniel_	  I just keep my sound off  especially for those darn bongos :")
2011-05-16T02:18:00.000Z	coz_	daniel_	 as I said there were plans to create a easy to use utility for this .. apparenlty it fell t hrough
2011-05-16T02:18:00.000Z	daniel_	coz_	maybe cause its just so little not worth the effort?
2011-05-16T02:19:00.000Z	coz_	daniel_	 well maybe ,, but there was a small contest for new sounds including the login sound,, I even put in a couple packages for it,,   I didnt hear anything about anyone's packages being chosen and apparenlty they werent since we still have the same sounds
2011-05-16T02:20:00.000Z	daniel_	coz_	i got it off and im looking at this startup aplications should i turn off more cause i dont use ubuntu 1 or remote desktop or at least i dont think i do
2011-05-16T02:21:00.000Z	coz_	daniel_	 if you dont need them turn them off,, leave pulseaudo stuff alone  but bluetooth  etc  should be inf and if not you can reneable then on the next boot
2011-05-16T02:22:00.000Z	daniel_	coz_	alright well thanks alot now i have them damn bongs off lol
