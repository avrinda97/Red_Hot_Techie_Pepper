2007-07-23T14:27:00.000Z	tetonca		jet: he said it failed so I told him to apt-get update first.
2007-07-23T14:29:00.000Z	tetonca		I brought Alsa flowers.  She turned me down.  Then I gave her a box of chocolates.  Same outcome.
2007-07-23T14:31:00.000Z	tetonca		It .. was a joke.  He asked about Alsa experts.  That's a sound driver. /rimshot fades fast
2007-07-23T14:31:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	- Alsa can be a bit of a B*
2007-07-23T14:31:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	- but much nicer than her worthless sister Oss
2007-07-23T14:32:00.000Z	tetonca	dominussuus	heh.
2007-07-23T15:12:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	don't forget that Gates also tries to patent it and sell licenses back to Linux
2007-07-23T14:48:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	- I think his sources are pointing to the CD instead of the site
2007-07-23T14:52:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	- I thought it was the other way around
2007-07-23T14:53:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	right, misread your message :D
2007-07-23T15:02:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	but it doesn't work the same way as in Windows...
2007-07-23T15:03:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	of course... :D...
2007-07-23T15:21:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	... for the same reason that Macs haven't done the same
2007-07-23T15:13:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	then why does AMD exist if Microsoft provides the cheap hardware?
2007-07-23T15:15:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	the people to blame are the people in the Unix wars... if they weren't so busy fighting in the late 80s then they would have been able to stop Microsoft
2007-07-23T15:16:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	the x86 chips are soooo 1993 anyway
2007-07-23T15:17:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	so there were, but the point is that they turned their back on MS
2007-07-23T15:17:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	... until it was too late
2007-07-23T15:18:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	MS is still very dangerous, but I agree that Google is starting to become evil
2007-07-23T15:19:00.000Z	tetonca	dominussuus	http://www.landley.net/notes.html and search 'Paul Graham'.  MS is dead.  Also check out 'Stallman' on same page.
2007-07-23T15:20:00.000Z	dominussuus	tetonca	MS still has its hands in too many pies and I don't think that Canonical is going to be in a position to seize control of the desktop market by 08
