2008-10-07T20:18:00.000Z	bustaplz2		If I run sudo apt-get upgrade via ssh and disconnect before the operation finishes, will this stop the operation?
2008-10-07T20:19:00.000Z	draven1005	bustaplz2	yes.   start it with screen, then detach the screen and exit
2008-10-07T20:19:00.000Z	bustaplz2		you mean start it ON the machine rather than remotely?
2008-10-07T20:20:00.000Z	draven1005	bustaplz2	thats a better solution, but with screen you can do it remote.
2008-10-07T20:20:00.000Z	bustaplz2		what do you mean?
2008-10-07T20:21:00.000Z	draven1005	bustaplz2	sudo apt-get install screen    Then, man screen
2008-10-07T20:21:00.000Z	bustaplz2		oh i thought you were talking about screen as in monitor
2008-10-07T20:22:00.000Z	bustaplz2		to be clear, I'm connected via ssh on Putty
2008-10-07T20:23:00.000Z	bustaplz2		would screen be installed on the ssh host machine or on the remote machine?
2008-10-07T20:23:00.000Z	draven1005	bustaplz2	you install screen on the machine you want to upgrade.   sudo apt-get install screen       Then, man screen
2008-10-07T20:24:00.000Z	bustaplz2		okay
2008-10-07T20:24:00.000Z	bustaplz2		i probably should have done that before i did sudo apt-get upgrade huh?
2008-10-07T20:25:00.000Z	draven1005	bustaplz2	yes....
2008-10-07T20:25:00.000Z	bustaplz2		=D live and learn!
2008-10-07T20:25:00.000Z	draven1005	bustaplz2	also, please prefix replies with the name of the person you are replying to.
2008-10-07T20:25:00.000Z	bustaplz2	draven1005	okay, sorry
2008-10-07T20:26:00.000Z	draven1005	bustaplz2	aww, now i can see your replies much easier.  thanks
2008-10-07T20:26:00.000Z	bustaplz2	draven1005	i'm in class so I don't know if the upgrade will finish before I have to shut down =P
2008-10-07T20:26:00.000Z	bustaplz2	draven1005	How bad will that screw things up?
2008-10-07T20:27:00.000Z	draven1005	bustaplz2	if you use screen, then detach the screen you can safely close your ssh connection.
2008-10-07T20:29:00.000Z	bustaplz2	draven1005	Looks like I'm in the clear, upgrade just finished. Going to install screen and play around with it a bit. Thanks for the advice!
