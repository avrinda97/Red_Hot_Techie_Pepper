2010-03-02T01:42:00.000Z	Nolan2		Okay, so seriously, no one can help me?
2010-03-02T01:43:00.000Z	Nolan2		Heh.
2010-03-02T01:44:00.000Z	Nolan2		brb, going to try something different...
2010-03-02T01:45:00.000Z	Nolan2		Well, what other way can I put it?
2010-03-02T01:45:00.000Z	Nolan2		It looks like it's going to load, but it just displays a blinking _
2010-03-02T01:45:00.000Z	Nolan2		And does nothing.
2010-03-02T01:46:00.000Z	Nolan2		Yeah Olu, It does the same thing.
2010-03-02T01:47:00.000Z	Nolan2		The Windows Boot files are still there, and the OS is too.
2010-03-02T01:48:00.000Z	Nolan2		Sorry about that histo.
2010-03-02T01:48:00.000Z	Nolan2		That was to Olu.
2010-03-02T01:50:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Nolan2	are you trying to remove Windows to install Linux?
2010-03-02T01:51:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Nolan2	do you have two logical partitions on the Hard Drive?
2010-03-02T01:52:00.000Z	Nolan2	Curly_Q	Nope.
2010-03-02T01:54:00.000Z	Nolan2	Curly_Q	Idk...
2010-03-02T03:18:00.000Z	Nolan2	Curly_Q	do you have any other solutions to my issue? :/
2010-03-02T03:20:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Nolan2	Sorry for not following completely what you were doing. However, I do know that there might be a CMOS setup problem. What is happening now with your installation?
2010-03-02T03:21:00.000Z	Nolan2	Curly_Q	Okay, I just tried creating a boot command for grub to load the windows partition, and it's still just displaying a blinking _ lol.
2010-03-02T03:23:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Nolan2	try this. If you have a Windows 98 boot disk with SMART on it, do an fdisk and check if there is stuff on your partitions. It will tell you also what type of file system is there lest it be NTFS or 32 or 16 bit and so. Also what Operating system are you using with Windows?
2010-03-02T03:28:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Nolan2	what is happening is that your MBR (Master Boot Record) is corrupted.
2010-03-02T03:30:00.000Z	Nolan2	Curly_Q	I can mount the partition from Ubuntu and access all of the data on that partition
2010-03-02T03:31:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Nolan2	the next thing to do is to copy that data, however, you may still run into a problem. The type of file system that is looking at that data may convert it while copying. Use the NTFS Windows to copy that data unless Ubuntu has a perfect replication of that data. Then burn it on a CD or copy it to another drive.
