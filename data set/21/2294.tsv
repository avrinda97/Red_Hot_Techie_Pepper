2011-02-25T20:35:00.000Z	lolcatz		hmm hi there... I am a bit perplexed that on meerkat amd64, my cpu scaling is not supported (cpu freq) doesn't work, which I most certianly need to on this buid.so I thought I'd compile a new ubuntu kernel branch for myself but it seems cpufreq is available by default sigh. ideaS? known issu(s) or? B. I was wondering how large the 2.6.35-ubuntu kernel compilation dirs take up? roughyl.. could an6yone hint to me, as I wish to try and se
2011-02-25T20:35:00.000Z	lolcatz		e if I can keep it under 1.5 GB and compile it in my ram :)
2011-02-25T20:35:00.000Z	lolcatz		erm I think some lines got eaten up :/
2011-02-25T20:36:00.000Z	lolcatz		roasted, well you can set up a ddaeom onr cronjob to do so but you would need to have either a password,known network or similar
2011-02-25T20:37:00.000Z	lolcatz		Roasted_,
2011-02-25T20:37:00.000Z	lolcatz		daemon or cronjob
2011-02-25T20:38:00.000Z	lolcatz		so is there some reason why cpufreq wouldn't be 'enabled' or working under meerkat 64, ona desktop with recognised components?
2011-02-25T20:38:00.000Z	Roasted_	lolcatz	well like with Windows, it connects to the wireless network even before the user logs in. That way when a domain user logs in, it can authenticate. With Linux, though, it doesn't connect until a local user is already logged in, which begs the obvious question - how in the flippin world am I supposed to use a wireless Linux system with LDAP?
2011-02-25T20:42:00.000Z	lolcatz	Roasted_	a quick overview http://luv.asn.au/overheads/linux-startup.html
2011-02-25T20:46:00.000Z	lolcatz	Roasted_	, my point being you can initiliase some shell scripts which can do the network hunt for you before login, this is for sure..
2011-02-25T21:01:00.000Z	Roasted_	lolcatz	hey some people are telling me I just need to check "available to all users" in network manager for the SSID. Do you know how I can test this to see if I have a connection @ login screen?
2011-02-25T21:05:00.000Z	Roasted_	lolcatz	yo... seems as if "available to all users" in network manager is all I had to do.
2011-02-25T21:05:00.000Z	Roasted_	lolcatz	I enabled it and @ login screen did a CTRL ALT F2 and ran ifconfig, and I had an IP. I went back, disabled it, rebooted, CTRL ALT F2 and ifconfig again, no IP...
2011-02-25T21:06:00.000Z	lolcatz	Roasted_	 ! see, the experienced ones always know what they talk about.. I am liek George Double_U Bush: SPeak out of my arse, then I attempt to think and realise I can't think as my answer has no true meaning to the question!
2011-02-25T21:06:00.000Z	Roasted_	lolcatz	I have no idea what you just said.
2011-02-25T21:07:00.000Z	lolcatz	Roasted_	I know :)
2011-02-25T21:07:00.000Z	Roasted_	lolcatz	I like your style.
2011-02-25T21:09:00.000Z	lolcatz	Roasted_	my point was that hmm, I won't be your best bet on solving your problem..
2011-02-25T21:09:00.000Z	Roasted_	lolcatz	I wasn't asking for help. I was telling you how I solved the question I asked you about earlier :P
2011-02-25T21:10:00.000Z	lolcatz	Roasted_	 I mean... ye I know I saw it and was nice to see hwo easy it was .. but then it seemd you hit another issue?
2011-02-25T21:10:00.000Z	Roasted_	lolcatz	well I had 2 questions, 1 was solved
