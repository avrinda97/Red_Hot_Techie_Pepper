2007-03-01T13:26:00.000Z	omegabeta		 Depends: nvidia-kernel-common  but it is not installable
2007-03-01T13:26:00.000Z	omegabeta		
2007-03-01T13:26:00.000Z	omegabeta		so when i try to instal the common, the does not work either
2007-03-01T13:27:00.000Z	omegabeta		yep
2007-03-01T13:27:00.000Z	omegabeta		it will let me install nvidia-glx by itself though, which wants to install a 385 kernel aswell.. should i just do that>?
2007-03-01T13:27:00.000Z	omegabeta		386*
2007-03-01T06:33:00.000Z	omegabeta		Weird question, is there a way to make an Ubuntu install CD that installs everything the way it is now, drivers and all? just like a normal install.. but not?
2007-03-01T06:33:00.000Z	posingaspopular	omegabeta	yes, you can make a custom install cd
2007-03-01T06:34:00.000Z	omegabeta	posingaspopular	Niiice, any info on that? just.. spent 9 hours getting the net/graphics/ other stuff to work and i dont ever EVER want to have to do that again.. so would like to make my own custom install that imnstalls everything how it is
2007-03-01T06:35:00.000Z	posingaspopular	omegabeta	umm not really, my brother and i have been toying with the idea of figuring out it but thats a 'summer' project
2007-03-01T06:35:00.000Z	posingaspopular		i do know its possible though
2007-03-01T06:35:00.000Z	omegabeta		haha no worries
2007-03-01T06:35:00.000Z	omegabeta		opps wait a minute
2007-03-01T06:35:00.000Z	omegabeta		aha
2007-03-01T06:36:00.000Z	omegabeta	posingaspopular	donwload "Reconstructer" images everything and makes an install, just found it :)
2007-03-01T06:36:00.000Z	posingaspopular		oh awesome
2007-03-01T06:36:00.000Z	posingaspopular		Reconstrutcter
2007-03-01T06:36:00.000Z	posingaspopular		thats great
2007-03-01T06:36:00.000Z	omegabeta	posingaspopular	Hell yes, and by the looks of it.. its fool proof.. the first options i can see here aree "Create Live cd" and "Create install"
