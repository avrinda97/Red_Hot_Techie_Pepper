2008-05-12T14:52:00.000Z	magnetron	Deags	i don't understand your question
2008-05-12T14:53:00.000Z	magnetron	Deags	i use bluetooth daily, works nice
2008-05-12T14:58:00.000Z	Deags	magnetron	ok installed ubuntu 8.04 and i got a bluetooth dongle from walmart brand iogear model# GBU221-321 and i plugged it in and of course my lil bluetooth icon poped up it detects my headset plantronics just fine but my phone the vx8600 from lg does not work doesnt even show up on the list ( its in discovery mode and bluetooth is on ) so i google instructions on my specific phone on ubuntu and they say do these steps 1. sudo apt-get insta

2008-05-12T15:03:00.000Z	magnetron	Deags	what do you mean when you say that "your phone doesn't show up in bluetooth"?
2008-05-12T15:09:00.000Z	Deags	magnetron	: find anything wierd about those instructions why they would work for him and not me?
2008-05-12T15:10:00.000Z	magnetron	Deags	you still haven't answered my question what isn't working for you.
2008-05-12T15:11:00.000Z	Deags	magnetron	o i did i must have spelled ur name wrong so it didnt show up lol it doesnt show up in the browse  devices
2008-05-12T15:12:00.000Z	magnetron	Deags	try to send a file from the phone to the pc
2008-05-12T15:12:00.000Z	Deags	magnetron	i cannot my phone doesnt see my pc either
2008-05-12T15:13:00.000Z	magnetron	Deags	since it's working for your headset, and PC, it has to be a problem with the phone.
2008-05-12T15:17:00.000Z	Deags	magnetron	could it be the channel are there channels in bluetooth like wireless internet?
2008-05-12T15:17:00.000Z	magnetron	Deags	no.
2008-05-12T15:18:00.000Z	Deags	magnetron	i dont get it at all then could it be because its linux should i try wine installing the cd that came with it?
2008-05-12T15:19:00.000Z	magnetron	Deags	no. your bluetooth and ubuntu works just fine, since you can find and connect to the headset. make sure to read your phone manual on how to activate bluetooth.
2008-05-12T15:21:00.000Z	Deags	magnetron	i apreciate your attempt at helping me can i throw one more problem your way that may or maynot be linked?
2008-05-12T15:22:00.000Z	magnetron	Deags	ask your questions to the channel, the ones who knows the answer will answer.
