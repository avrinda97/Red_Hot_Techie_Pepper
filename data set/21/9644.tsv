2005-08-10T08:26:00.000Z	ateoh211		hello, would anyone be willing to help me to troubleshoot wvdial?
2005-08-10T08:26:00.000Z	ateoh211		apt-cache search filename
2005-08-10T08:28:00.000Z	ateoh211		I run setup for the modem and put a username a pword in for my isp...
2005-08-10T08:28:00.000Z	ateoh211		sometime it hangs after -->Modem initialized   -->Please enter password(or empy password to stop):
2005-08-10T08:30:00.000Z	ateoh211		We are trying to start a community program, ubuntu on donated systems for those who can't afford.
2005-08-10T08:30:00.000Z	ateoh211		but I'm having a heck of a time with this modem
2005-08-10T08:30:00.000Z	ateoh211		does anyone do dial up anymore?
2005-08-10T08:32:00.000Z	ateoh211		..setup?
2005-08-10T08:33:00.000Z	nickrud	ateoh211	use pppconfig, not wvdial
2005-08-10T08:42:00.000Z	ateoh211	nickrud	thanks, that got me closer, I'm actually getting a handshake, but can't tell why it fails
2005-08-10T08:43:00.000Z	ateoh211	nickrud	my username and password are definitely correct
2005-08-10T08:47:00.000Z	nickrud	ateoh211	sorry, just dropped back in
2005-08-10T08:48:00.000Z	nickrud	ateoh211	try this: start a gnome-terminal, and execute tail -f /var/log/syslog
2005-08-10T08:49:00.000Z	nickrud	ateoh211	then, in another gnome terminal, try pon. There may be some useful messages on the other terminal
2005-08-10T08:50:00.000Z	ateoh211	nickrud	ok, LCP: timeout sending Config-Requests, connection terminated, receive seril link is not 8-bit clean: Problem: all had bit 7 set to 0
2005-08-10T08:50:00.000Z	nickrud	ateoh211	I have _never_ seen anything like that, so, maybe direwolf has some pointers
2005-08-10T08:52:00.000Z	ateoh211	nickrud	should I be able to see my password in the clear in the logs, I don't, but I'm just curious if that's the problem
2005-08-10T08:52:00.000Z	nickrud	ateoh211	maybe, paste the total errors to pastebin, I may recognize something :)
2005-08-10T08:53:00.000Z	nickrud	ateoh211	I've diagnosed dialup errrors since 300kbs
2005-08-10T08:54:00.000Z	ateoh211	nickrud	i'm wondering if maybe I need our vpn client
2005-08-10T08:56:00.000Z	nickrud	ateoh211	not if it is just 'get my machine talking to another machine that will be my gateway'. But, corporate stuff cancels all normality.
