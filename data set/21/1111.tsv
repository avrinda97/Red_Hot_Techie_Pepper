2012-08-26T23:57:00.000Z	vaio		need some help with lid actions on ubuntu 10.04... laptop lid-close/open: suspend/hibernate doesn't work. can anyone help? thanks
2012-08-26T23:57:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	how much ram do you have?
2012-08-26T23:57:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	and how much swap do you have?
2012-08-26T23:58:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	ok, thought i'd try the simplest problem
2012-08-27T00:00:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	and you have it set to suspend/hibernate in the power settings when you close the lid?
2012-08-27T00:00:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	well then i can't help you
2012-08-27T00:03:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	i think swap is for hibernation, suspension is to ram
2012-08-27T00:06:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	you're not using any special boot parameters are you?
2012-08-27T00:08:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	acpi
2012-08-27T00:09:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	sorry, i meant acpi options can be set at boot, hence my question about boot parameters
2012-08-27T00:10:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	if acpi was off then the lid action wouldn't be regestered/recognised
2012-08-27T00:11:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	whats the output of: lsmod
2012-08-27T00:15:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	copy and paste it to a paste site
2012-08-27T00:15:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	pastebin.com
2012-08-27T00:21:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	hmm, i can't see any reference to acpi in there
2012-08-27T00:23:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	i guess it depends on your model, i use thinkpads so i have thinkpad_acpi listed in lsmod
2012-08-27T00:24:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	maybe your equivilant is sony_laptop
2012-08-27T00:25:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	i don't know enough to be of help sorry
2012-08-27T00:25:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	maybe sony_laptop is your acpi module, like thinkpad_acpi is mine
2012-08-27T00:26:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	yeah, neither do i
2012-08-27T00:26:00.000Z	ThinkT510	vaio	that would be the kernel's job
