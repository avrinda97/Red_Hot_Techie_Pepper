2007-04-14T06:58:00.000Z	ajehuk	reep	- unless they are referred to elsewhere in the configuration...
2007-04-14T06:59:00.000Z	reep	ajehuk	they shouldn't be, unless it's been manually edited, apache2.conf includes mods-enabled/*
2007-04-14T07:00:00.000Z	ajehuk	reep	- I know - in this case though apache2 was installed with another package so could have a n/s conf, and I believe the symlink has been removed - and now apache2 refuses to start as it cannot find it...
2007-04-14T07:01:00.000Z	reep	ajehuk	ah, then you're probably right
2007-04-14T07:08:00.000Z	ajehuk	reep	- |Amon| - wow - you two just describes a nihtmare...
2007-04-14T07:12:00.000Z	ajehuk	reep	- php.ini
2007-04-14T07:13:00.000Z	reep	ajehuk	should be seperate dirs for php4 and php5, so if php4 don't get loaded, php4's php.ini should get read
2007-04-14T07:13:00.000Z	ajehuk	reep	- true - php4 was installed tho and only a sim link has been removed so ... hmmm
2007-04-14T07:15:00.000Z	ajehuk	reep	- any opinion on the above?
2007-04-14T07:17:00.000Z	reep	ajehuk	not sure... the only reference to php4, from apache2's point of view should be those two symlinks in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled... ecpessially after reconfiguring apache2
2007-04-15T06:39:00.000Z	ajehuk	reep	- hello again (deja-vu) :)
2007-04-15T06:40:00.000Z	reep	ajehuk	hehe, someone should file a bug on php
2007-04-15T06:41:00.000Z	ajehuk	reep	- bug? what bug - everything works fine for me here - EBCK if ever I saw one.. :)
2007-04-15T06:59:00.000Z	ajehuk	reep	- tbuss - this is what I was driving at yesterday when I suggested reinstalling apache (which rewrites the configs) and purging php4
2007-04-15T07:03:00.000Z	ajehuk	reep	- tbuss - great minds, and thinking alike - methinks
2007-04-15T07:07:00.000Z	ajehuk	reep	- are you fairly familiar with the more recent ubuntu installers?
2007-04-15T07:08:00.000Z	reep	ajehuk	I've installed Dapper and Edgy a couple of times... Tried upgrading from dapper to feisty some time ago, but it screwed up beryl, so I just reinstalled edgy
2007-04-15T07:09:00.000Z	ajehuk	reep	- what I meant was - formatiing part - is it still the old style (ala debian) front end or is it all fancy pants these days?
2007-04-15T07:10:00.000Z	reep	ajehuk	don't know what debian uses, but I was a bit annoyed that I only got two options... Let ubuntu repartition the drive, or do it manually (with gparted)
2007-04-15T07:10:00.000Z	reep	ajehuk	I seem to remember that when I installed dapper, I had more choices
2007-04-15T07:11:00.000Z	ajehuk	reep	: that clarifies it for me, - yeah cant reember the last version I used but it *was* the standard debian installer albeit for ubuntu, whith the whole range of options - guided partitionaing manual, auto all in one etc..
