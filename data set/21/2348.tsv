2009-11-02T17:38:00.000Z	danukman		hi can anyone help me (im a newbie) with a printer issue?
2009-11-02T17:40:00.000Z	danukman		i've downloaded both a cupswrapper and lpd debian file for my printer, but one isn't installing
2009-11-02T17:40:00.000Z	danukman		borther 2050N
2009-11-02T17:40:00.000Z	danukman		brother*
2009-11-02T17:41:00.000Z	danukman		yup
2009-11-02T17:41:00.000Z	wirechief	danukman	you may need csh with brother and install it first
2009-11-02T17:41:00.000Z	danukman		downloaded from the site
2009-11-02T17:41:00.000Z	danukman		csh??? wirechief
2009-11-02T17:41:00.000Z	danukman		sorry bit of a newbie
2009-11-02T17:42:00.000Z	wirechief	danukman	yes csh or tcsh, i have a mfc490cn and it needed those first, its on the install instructions at brothers site
2009-11-02T17:42:00.000Z	danukman		ok thanks i'll have a look
2009-11-02T17:43:00.000Z	wirechief	danukman	also you have to install lpr before the cupswrapper
2009-11-02T17:43:00.000Z	danukman		yeah the lpr failed to install
2009-11-02T17:43:00.000Z	danukman		could be a bad download?
2009-11-02T17:43:00.000Z	danukman		so i might try getting it again
2009-11-02T17:44:00.000Z	wirechief	danukman	dont know, but i would follow their install instructions.
2009-11-02T17:44:00.000Z	danukman		ok thx wirechief, thanks for you time! :)
2009-11-02T17:46:00.000Z	wirechief	danukman	all i know is printing in linux is a pita with brother, after you get it working then a cups update comes along and you have to reinstall :(  I have a guide someplace i could pastebin it
2009-11-02T17:47:00.000Z	danukman	wirechief	might be a case of just using my xp side of the system?
2009-11-02T17:48:00.000Z	danukman	wirechief	I did see a guide somewhere in brother printers, but I gave up the other day, and now can't find the page on it!
2009-11-02T17:54:00.000Z	wirechief	danukman	steps ive used in the past, your model probably is different and of course the .debs to install  >>http://pastebin.com/f412e588f
