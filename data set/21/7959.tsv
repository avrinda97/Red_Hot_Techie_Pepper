2011-02-24T17:34:00.000Z	YBinnenweg		okay... but I need to acces it from my windows comp. because I need my music on windows to sync it via itunes with my iphone

2011-02-24T17:36:00.000Z	YBinnenweg		a program called ext2fsd

2011-02-24T17:37:00.000Z	YBinnenweg		thats what i need :P
2011-02-24T17:37:00.000Z	YBinnenweg		i don't want to have 2 times 13 gigs of music xD
2011-02-24T17:37:00.000Z	jrib	YBinnenweg	so don't encrypt your music
2011-02-24T17:32:00.000Z	jrib	YBinnenweg	it's encrypted
2011-02-24T17:33:00.000Z	jrib	YBinnenweg	I'm not sure that's easily done on windows
2011-02-24T17:33:00.000Z	jrib	YBinnenweg	right, well when you log-in on ubuntu it will be automatically decrypted
2011-02-24T17:36:00.000Z	jrib	YBinnenweg	like I said, I don't think that will be easy.  You can read the details of the setup at the link I gave you
2011-02-24T17:38:00.000Z	jrib	YBinnenweg	I am telling you that you did, your home is encrypted
2011-02-24T17:39:00.000Z	jrib	YBinnenweg	at install there is an option to encrypt your home directory
2011-02-24T17:40:00.000Z	jrib	YBinnenweg	what you described earlier indicates that your home is encrypted, you can refuse to believe it, but that won't really change much :)
2011-02-24T17:40:00.000Z	jrib	YBinnenweg	just create some directory like /shared and move your music there (do this in ubuntu)
2011-02-24T17:41:00.000Z	jrib	YBinnenweg	the link I gave you tells you how to disable it altogether if you prefer
2011-02-24T17:44:00.000Z	jrib	YBinnenweg	stop pressing enter please
