2009-07-15T22:53:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved		can someone tell me if the 9.04 has the real cisco built in the kernel or does it use vpnc to connect
2009-07-15T22:53:00.000Z	mgolisch	ubuntuisloved	?
2009-07-15T22:53:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	mgolisch	just wondering if it's a real cisco built in or not
2009-07-15T22:53:00.000Z	mgolisch	ubuntuisloved	it doenst come with any vpn client
2009-07-15T22:54:00.000Z	mgolisch	ubuntuisloved	but you can install vpnc from the repos or compile the cisco one from source
2009-07-15T22:54:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	mgolisch	I know but you can install on 9.04 the vpnc-network manager module or such
2009-07-15T22:54:00.000Z	mgolisch	ubuntuisloved	i just use vpnc, it works flawless for me
2009-07-15T22:55:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	mgolisch	I keep getting disconnected on idle
2009-07-15T22:55:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	mgolisch	I also use vpnc right now
2009-07-15T22:56:00.000Z	mgolisch	ubuntuisloved	we have some old pix, i had problems with vpnc at first, it somehow killed the tunnel all the time, i think that was a result of some buggy dead peer detection code in vpnc, once i disabled that feature it worked well for me
2009-07-15T22:57:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	mgolisch	damn yes my network admin at work uses pix he loves them
2009-07-15T22:57:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	mgolisch	how do i disable that dead peer connection
2009-07-15T22:59:00.000Z	mgolisch	ubuntuisloved	you can start vpnc with --dpd-idle 0 to disable dead peer detection
2009-07-15T22:59:00.000Z	mgolisch	ubuntuisloved	there is also a config variable for that you can set in your config file
2009-07-15T22:59:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	mgolisch	thanks man I'm gonna try it
2009-07-15T23:01:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	mgolisch	since your so well educated let me ask do you also ever get issues with /etc/resolv.conf not returning back to default before vpn
2009-07-15T23:01:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	mgolisch	it doesnt happen all the time just some times
2009-07-15T23:02:00.000Z	mgolisch	ubuntuisloved	i have it very often, that after i vpnc-disconnect it doenst revert back to the old resolv.conf
2009-07-15T23:02:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	mgolisch	yes have you found a fix for that
2009-07-15T23:02:00.000Z	mgolisch	ubuntuisloved	but i was yet too lazy to look for a solution
2009-07-15T23:02:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	mgolisch	hhaha
