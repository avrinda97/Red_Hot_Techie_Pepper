2009-10-08T05:08:00.000Z	jonLappy	ed	So there isn't any way to unplug the webcam and plug it in.. that would make this easier.
2009-10-08T05:08:00.000Z	ed	jonLappy	lol no, im using a laptop its built into de screen
2009-10-08T05:08:00.000Z	jonLappy	ed	right. How about replace camera with video and try running that?
2009-10-08T05:09:00.000Z	ed	jonLappy	didnt understand..
2009-10-08T05:10:00.000Z	jonLappy	ed	`dmesg|grep video'
2009-10-08T05:12:00.000Z	jonLappy	ed	your webcam should work. Now type in `sudo apt-get install cheese` (or is cheese preinstalled?)
