2007-12-06T03:57:00.000Z	wpk	crdlb	why so/
2007-12-06T03:57:00.000Z	crdlb	wpk	because there are no advantages
2007-12-06T03:58:00.000Z	crdlb		it has higher performance for high-end calculation, but desktops don't do that
2007-12-06T03:58:00.000Z	wpk	crdlb	have you tested that?
2007-12-06T03:58:00.000Z	crdlb		it's more work for no gain
2007-12-06T03:58:00.000Z	wpk	crdlb	have you tested that?
2007-12-06T03:59:00.000Z	crdlb	wpk	there are lots of benchmarks
2007-12-06T03:59:00.000Z	wpk	crdlb	link?
2007-12-06T04:00:00.000Z	crdlb	wpk	showing what exactly?
2007-12-06T04:00:00.000Z	wpk	crdlb	advantages of 32bit over 64bit
2007-12-06T04:01:00.000Z	crdlb	wpk	it's just less tested and newer, and there are no *advantages*
2007-12-06T04:01:00.000Z	crdlb		to 64bit
2007-12-06T04:01:00.000Z	wpk	crdlb	speed?
2007-12-06T04:01:00.000Z	crdlb		it's not faster for a desktop
2007-12-06T04:02:00.000Z	crdlb		you're not doing tons of floating-point calculations
2007-12-06T04:02:00.000Z	wpk	crdlb	well yes I am, but it doesn't matter
2007-12-06T04:03:00.000Z	crdlb	wpk	if you are, then use 64bit
2007-12-06T04:03:00.000Z	crdlb		most people aren't
2007-12-06T04:05:00.000Z	wpk	crdlb	besides, what cpu-specific optimizations does 32bit ubuntu have?
2007-12-06T04:06:00.000Z	crdlb	wpk	none? they might -mtune to i686 ...
2007-12-06T04:07:00.000Z	wpk	crdlb	it can't use any of the i686 cpu ALU instructions
