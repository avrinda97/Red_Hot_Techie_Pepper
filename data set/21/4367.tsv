2010-05-12T19:32:00.000Z	joaopinto		ryanakca, because LVM adds management complexity, and not much value on a desktop configuration
2010-05-12T19:32:00.000Z	joaopinto		ops, was for ryoohki ^
2010-05-12T19:32:00.000Z	ryoohki	joaopinto	it's not harder in any way
2010-05-12T19:31:00.000Z	joaopinto	ryoohki	no, I don't recommend using lvm on a desktop
2010-05-12T19:31:00.000Z	ryoohki	joaopinto	and why not?
2010-05-12T19:32:00.000Z	ryoohki	joaopinto	not it adds flexibility and control
2010-05-12T19:32:00.000Z	joaopinto	ryoohki	it hads the fliexbility and control that you need on a server, not on a desktop
2010-05-12T19:33:00.000Z	ryoohki	joaopinto	there is no diff from a server to a desktop except the graphics interface
2010-05-12T19:34:00.000Z	joaopinto	ryoohki	uh ? my desktop systems don't have external storage or SANs, and they don't get their disk changed/replaced frequently :)
2010-05-12T19:34:00.000Z	ryoohki	joaopinto	there is no reason to want flexibility on a server and not on a desktop
2010-05-12T19:34:00.000Z	joaopinto	ryoohki	comparing desktop use to server use is non sense :)
2010-05-12T19:34:00.000Z	ryoohki	joaopinto	no usb hds? never fill the drive and add another one?
2010-05-12T19:35:00.000Z	ryoohki	joaopinto	you are being dogmatic - servers are simpler - no graphics card...
2010-05-12T19:35:00.000Z	joaopinto	ryoohki	no, the disks I have from 3 years ago suite well my needs, if I need to change I can afford the downtime, unlike on a server
2010-05-12T19:35:00.000Z	joaopinto	ryoohki	server is a role, not a specification, there are plenty of servers with graphical cards
2010-05-12T19:37:00.000Z	ryoohki	joaopinto	but generally that's the main differnce
2010-05-12T19:37:00.000Z	ryoohki	joaopinto	that and audio
2010-05-12T19:38:00.000Z	ryoohki	joaopinto	duh - of course
2010-05-12T19:39:00.000Z	ryoohki	joaopinto	servers generally don't provide a multimedia console
2010-05-12T19:39:00.000Z	ryoohki	joaopinto	a cell phone can be a sever...
2010-05-12T19:40:00.000Z	joaopinto	ryoohki	please stop, go offtopic please
