2009-03-31T00:14:00.000Z	ChotaZ		any MSN client for linux with msn plus???
2009-03-31T00:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ChotaZ	MSN Plus is not a good program
2009-03-31T00:15:00.000Z	ChotaZ	sebsebseb	Why's that, I liked it on windows ^^
2009-03-31T00:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ChotaZ	even if you say no to the sponser program, you could get malicious program spyware or some such installed  for it
2009-03-31T00:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ChotaZ	 what I said above
2009-03-31T00:16:00.000Z	ChotaZ	sebsebseb	just wanted to get rid of the BBCode on my contacts names <.<
2009-03-31T00:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ChotaZ	 MSN plus won't work in  Wine,  Windows Live Messenger won't either or won't work well.  both programs aren't that good
2009-03-31T00:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ChotaZ	and MSN plus was only made, since Live Messenger wasn't good enough in the first place.  there are some resonable MSN  alternatives for Linux
2009-03-31T00:18:00.000Z	ChotaZ	sebsebseb	Like amsn pidgin and emesene?
2009-03-31T00:18:00.000Z	ChotaZ	sebsebseb	msn had msnplus like plugins, without the malicious software
2009-03-31T00:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ChotaZ	sure and Kmess,  and  Mercury Messenger  which is closed source made by only one guy and you need Java for it
2009-03-31T00:18:00.000Z	ChotaZ	sebsebseb	I mean emesene*
2009-03-31T00:18:00.000Z	ChotaZ	sebsebseb	but file transfers with the latest WLM versions werent working so I had to drop it
2009-03-31T00:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ChotaZ	MSN there are much better networks out there.   if you really must have  MSN plus well...
2009-03-31T00:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ChotaZ	if  you really must have stupid MSN plus.  you can  have  Live Messenger and MSN plus in a Windows virtual machine inside Ubuntu, as long as your computer has enough RAM
2009-03-31T00:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ChotaZ	and yes Jabber is a nice network since it's open source
2009-03-31T00:22:00.000Z	ChotaZ	sebsebseb	you didnt understand me, I wanted an alternative for linux, not to use the original malicious software ;)
2009-03-31T00:22:00.000Z	ChotaZ	sebsebseb	www.emesene.org something like that but had working file transfers
2009-03-31T00:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ChotaZ	well there isn't  really a proper alternative,  since  Desktop Linux does not have enough market share,  and so it hardly has any crapware :D if any at all
2009-04-01T03:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ChotaZ	is Flash installed?
2009-04-01T03:54:00.000Z	ChotaZ	sebsebseb	Yes I can see youtube vids just fine
