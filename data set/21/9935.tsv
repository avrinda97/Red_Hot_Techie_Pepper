2005-06-16T06:04:00.000Z	debugger		hi
2005-06-16T06:04:00.000Z	debugger		why does unbunu have inetd running by default?  it doesn't seem to launch any daemon, thou...
2005-06-16T06:05:00.000Z	crimsun	debugger	neither default Warty nor Hoary enable inetd
2005-06-16T06:05:00.000Z	debugger	crimsun	humm, why do I have it running then?
2005-06-16T06:06:00.000Z	debugger	crimsun	I just installed ubuntu, using the "server" option on the bootable cd.
2005-06-16T06:06:00.000Z	crimsun	debugger	oh, server
2005-06-16T06:06:00.000Z	crimsun	debugger	desktop (normal) definitely doesn't enable it
2005-06-16T06:06:00.000Z	debugger	crimsun	so why "server" has it?  it doesn't lauch anything..
2005-06-16T06:07:00.000Z	crimsun	debugger	not my ballpark
2005-06-16T06:07:00.000Z	debugger	crimsun	if I simulate a erase, it will try to remove: at* mailx* mutt* netbase* netkit-inetd* postfix* postfix-tls* ppp* pppconfig* pppoeconf*
2005-06-16T06:07:00.000Z	debugger		  telnet* ubuntu-base*
2005-06-16T06:07:00.000Z	debugger	crimsun	NB: ubuntu-base is in there!
2005-06-16T06:08:00.000Z	debugger	crimsun	I find it harder to beleive that you don't have the inetd package installed :|
2005-06-16T06:09:00.000Z	crimsun	debugger	I didn't say I don't have it installed
2005-06-16T06:09:00.000Z	debugger	crimsun	oh, sorry, you said you didn't have it enabled :/
2005-06-16T06:10:00.000Z	debugger	crimsun	anyways, can you check it?  eg: ps ax|grep inetd ?
2005-06-16T06:10:00.000Z	crimsun	debugger	hmm, I don't have it enabled
2005-06-16T06:11:00.000Z	crimsun	debugger	I believe I manually checked, though
2005-06-16T06:11:00.000Z	debugger	crimsun	how do you enable/disable it?
2005-06-16T06:11:00.000Z	debugger	crimsun	I did it with: update-rc.d -f inetd remove   is the the right thing to do?
2005-06-16T06:11:00.000Z	crimsun	debugger	yep
