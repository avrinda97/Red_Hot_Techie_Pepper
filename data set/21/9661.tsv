2005-08-10T10:17:00.000Z	shammy		Why won;t it recognize the drive and put an icon on the desktop anymore when i put a cd in? I need to get the kernel headers but can't without the install cd
2005-08-10T10:18:00.000Z	avanspronsen	shammy	have you removed the CD entry from /etc/apt/sources.list?
2005-08-10T10:18:00.000Z	shammy	avanspronsen	nope, this is a fresh install and i've done nothing but reconfigure x
2005-08-10T10:19:00.000Z	avanspronsen	shammy	if you remove the cd entry you will force apt to go to the online repositories
2005-08-10T10:20:00.000Z	shammy	avanspronsen	I need the kernel headers so i can install ndiswrapper and get my internet working, so i can't get the online repositories
2005-08-10T10:20:00.000Z	avanspronsen	shammy	gotcha
2005-08-10T10:21:00.000Z	shammy	avanspronsen	what is the cdrom's name so i can mount it manually?
2005-08-10T10:23:00.000Z	avanspronsen	shammy	depends, how many hard drives?
2005-08-10T10:24:00.000Z	shammy	avanspronsen	2 hardrives, one cdrom/dvd drive
2005-08-10T10:24:00.000Z	avanspronsen	shammy	/dev//hdc
2005-08-10T10:24:00.000Z	shammy	avanspronsen	ok thanks
2005-08-10T10:24:00.000Z	avanspronsen	shammy	give it a try, let me know
2005-08-10T10:25:00.000Z	shammy	avanspronsen	one more thing, suppose it gets mounted correctly, how can i specify the cd is in that dir to get the headers?
2005-08-10T10:26:00.000Z	avanspronsen	shammy	just do your apt-get install, it should find it if it is mounted
2005-08-10T10:26:00.000Z	shammy	avanspronsen	thanks alot
2005-08-10T10:27:00.000Z	avanspronsen	shammy	np, I am just learning this stuff too, hopefully I got you going in the right direction :-)
2005-08-10T10:31:00.000Z	shammy	avanspronsen	i just tryed mounting the cdrom drive, it's spinning and the terminal is at a blank line, like something is happening..but it's still going, how long would it take?
2005-08-10T10:32:00.000Z	avanspronsen	shammy	shouldn't take long at all
2005-08-10T10:34:00.000Z	avanspronsen	shammy	If you type mount in a terminal windows you don't see a line with /media/cdrom?
2005-08-10T10:35:00.000Z	shammy	avanspronsen	i need to go do ctr c like xenguy said, but last time i looked it was still processing something
2005-08-10T10:35:00.000Z	avanspronsen	shammy	ok, sounds good
