2008-08-16T06:26:00.000Z	Slade	d4t4min3r	how set are you in using rhythmbox?
2008-08-16T06:27:00.000Z	d4t4min3r	Slade	im not sure why
2008-08-16T06:27:00.000Z	d4t4min3r	Slade	what would you sugest
2008-08-16T06:27:00.000Z	Slade	d4t4min3r	cause you could run other music players... XMMS, AmaroK, etc
2008-08-16T06:28:00.000Z	d4t4min3r	Slade	i tried to run amarok but it installs the older version.. amarok 2 i think it is .. is out
2008-08-16T06:28:00.000Z	Slade	d4t4min3r	ok, so download the latest version, compile and install :)
2008-08-16T06:28:00.000Z	d4t4min3r	Slade	does amarok 2 do ipod
2008-08-16T06:28:00.000Z	d4t4min3r		like... transfer files and stuff
2008-08-16T06:29:00.000Z	Slade	d4t4min3r	yes. If you mount the ipod (mount -t hpfsplus /dev/xxxx /mnt/ipod)  where xxxx is the physical device... it will read it
2008-08-16T06:29:00.000Z	d4t4min3r		Slade... ohoh it doesnt mount it itself
2008-08-16T06:29:00.000Z	Slade		well
2008-08-16T06:29:00.000Z	Slade		actually
2008-08-16T06:29:00.000Z	Slade		i lie
2008-08-16T06:29:00.000Z	Slade		because if the ipod is plugged in, you'll see it on your desktop
2008-08-16T06:30:00.000Z	d4t4min3r		Slade... any idea why rhytmbox just stoped working
2008-08-16T06:30:00.000Z	Slade		so it's probably in /media/<your name's> ipod
2008-08-16T06:30:00.000Z	Slade	d4t4min3r	maybe it wants higher wages or more vacation hours?
2008-08-16T06:36:00.000Z	d4t4min3r	Slade	how could i get the newest version of amarok agin
