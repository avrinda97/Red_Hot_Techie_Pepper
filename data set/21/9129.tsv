2005-11-07T17:26:00.000Z	bolrod		why do it with sudo
2005-11-07T17:26:00.000Z	bolrod		?
2005-11-07T17:26:00.000Z	bolrod		execute*
2005-11-07T17:28:00.000Z	bolrod		if someone gets into my account...  they can perform sudo
2005-11-07T17:28:00.000Z	bolrod		now .. they cant
2005-11-07T17:28:00.000Z	bolrod		and since I run most programs as normal user
2005-11-07T17:28:00.000Z	bolrod		I'd have to create another user .. without sudo
2005-11-07T17:28:00.000Z	bolrod		which is basically the same as removing myself from sudo
2005-11-07T17:28:00.000Z	bolrod		right?
2005-11-07T17:29:00.000Z	bolrod		oh...
2005-11-07T17:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	bolrod	someone finding out your root account pw could do the same thing...
2005-11-07T17:29:00.000Z	bolrod	Madpilot	but I'm not using the root account for irc
2005-11-07T17:29:00.000Z	bolrod		and stuff
2005-11-07T17:30:00.000Z	bolrod		yes...
2005-11-07T17:31:00.000Z	bolrod		anyway.. what is the link to this wiki? :)  it seems quite dead still
2005-11-07T17:32:00.000Z	bolrod		hmm.... ubuntu needs to upgrade their servers... I think :)
2005-11-07T17:32:00.000Z	Madpilot	bolrod	slashdot hit...
2005-11-07T17:33:00.000Z	bolrod	Madpilot	so? :)   shouldn't they be prepared for that
2005-11-07T17:34:00.000Z	bolrod		you can open /etc/fstab without root too.. just not alter it
2005-11-07T17:34:00.000Z	bolrod		I think
2005-11-07T17:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	bolrod	I'm not sure there really is such a thing as "being prepared for slashdot"...
