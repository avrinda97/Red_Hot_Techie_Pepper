2006-04-04T16:59:00.000Z	pengo		eog is shit. what's a good image viewer?
2006-04-04T16:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pengo	depends on preference - I like gqview personally
2006-04-04T16:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pengo	or see if you like gthumb
2006-04-04T05:00:00.000Z	pengo	thoreauputic	just want something that doesn't crash, and will precache the next image
2006-04-04T05:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pengo	I've never seen gqview crash
2006-04-04T05:00:00.000Z	pengo	thoreauputic	i'll give it a go. thanks.
2006-04-04T05:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pengo	don't know about the precaching...
2006-04-04T05:01:00.000Z	pengo	thoreauputic	does "next" work quickly?
2006-04-04T05:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pengo	seems fine here - you can scroll through imgages with the mouse scroll wheel too
2006-04-04T05:02:00.000Z	pengo	thoreauputic	cool. i'm downloading.
2006-04-04T05:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pengo	if you like small and fast, feh is nice - but it is a CLI app
2006-04-04T05:03:00.000Z	pengo	thoreauputic	nah, i prefer bloated, functional, and usable :)
2006-04-04T05:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pengo	feh is *very* functional and usable, and powerful too
2006-04-04T05:04:00.000Z	pengo	thoreauputic	ok i'll check it out too :)
2006-04-04T05:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pengo	for instance   feh -ZFrD 1 .   will give a screenshow of the current dir with a 1 second interval, fullscreen and recursive
2006-04-04T05:05:00.000Z	pengo	thoreauputic	nice
2006-04-04T05:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pengo	the man page is actually quite informative :)
2006-04-04T05:06:00.000Z	pengo	thoreauputic	an informative man page! heavens no! ... gqview does precaching. wonderful :)
2006-04-04T05:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pengo	 ;-)
2006-04-04T05:11:00.000Z	pengo	thoreauputic	gqview lets you rename a file (ctrl-r). and will autorotate with EXIF info. i'm happy now.
2006-04-04T05:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pengo	glad to hear it :)
