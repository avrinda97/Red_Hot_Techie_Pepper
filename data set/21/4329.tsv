2008-05-13T17:55:00.000Z	BUGabundo_work	DracoZA	no prob
2008-05-13T17:55:00.000Z	BUGabundo_work	DracoZA	can you repay back by testing sshfs?
2008-05-13T17:55:00.000Z	BUGabundo_work		to see if it is just me, or if it is a bug?
2008-05-13T17:55:00.000Z	DracoZA	BUGabundo_work	you tell me how and sure
2008-05-13T17:56:00.000Z	BUGabundo_work	DracoZA	sudo apt-get install sshfs (if you don't have it yet)
2008-05-13T17:56:00.000Z	BUGabundo_work	DracoZA	then just run it from a shell
2008-05-13T17:57:00.000Z	DracoZA	BUGabundo_work	k where do you want me to connect to ?
2008-05-13T17:58:00.000Z	BUGabundo_work	DracoZA	no need to connect nowhere
2008-05-13T17:58:00.000Z	BUGabundo_work		just test it
2008-05-13T17:59:00.000Z	BUGabundo_work	DracoZA	if it fails, as it does with me, you get a lot of lines with dump
2008-05-13T17:59:00.000Z	DracoZA	BUGabundo_work	it runs : "missing host" is the response
2008-05-13T17:59:00.000Z	BUGabundo_work		so it is on my side
2008-05-13T18:00:00.000Z	BUGabundo_work		thanks, DracoZA
