2007-12-02T06:28:00.000Z	bulmer		mic21-> is that an error from your log file?
2007-12-02T06:28:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	it's the error on the client with dmesg.
2007-12-02T06:29:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	yes and the home dir is mounted; but i can't login because of the timeout
2007-12-02T06:30:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	i mean with gnome; a simple login on the terminal is ok.
2007-12-02T06:30:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	yes
2007-12-02T06:31:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	on the clients ?
2007-12-02T06:38:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	I can't check now because I am not in the office but I know that I have installed nfs-common and portmap on the clients. The problem is appeared when we have change the address from 10.0.0.0 to 192.168.1.0. We have restarted the server but we can see some old entries in /var/lib/nfs/rmtab.
2007-12-02T06:40:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	some client address with old address 10.0.0.*
2007-12-02T06:42:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	my entry in the exports file is /home/ldap  192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
2007-12-02T06:44:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	but they don't exist anymore, is it a "trick" to clean the table ?
2007-12-02T06:45:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	do you think that the time out could come from those old entries ?
2007-12-02T06:47:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	the network is good, everything else works "fine" (1Gbps, cat 6 RJ45 cable).
2007-12-02T06:50:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	because before the change to 192.168.1.0 it was working well, we never had had timeout.
2007-12-02T06:53:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	ok, i will try the clear the table and to change sync to async. thank you for you help ;)
2007-12-02T07:02:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	I forget to say about an error (on ther server) when we restart the NFS server (with dmesg) : lockd_down: lockd failed to exit, clearing pid - nfsd: last server has exited - nfsd: unexporting all filesystems
2007-12-02T07:05:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	which lockfile ? in the /var/lib/nfs directory ?
2007-12-02T07:08:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	in /var/lock, I just have two empty directories "apache2" and "lvm"; I found an other lock file called /proc/lock, but I don't think it is that.
2007-12-02T07:09:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	when I stop the NFS server, the lockd process are still alive.
2007-12-02T07:17:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	ok I will search for it; if I can't solve the problem, do you think using NFS4 may solve it ? it is as stable as NFSv3 on gusty ?
2007-12-02T07:23:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	I will try if it doesn't work ... I have an other problem : with PAM, i am not able to use the pam_group.so plugin to attach local group to my ldap users ...
2007-12-02T07:24:00.000Z	mic21	bulmer	okey, btw thanks a lot for all the details and idea you found ;)
