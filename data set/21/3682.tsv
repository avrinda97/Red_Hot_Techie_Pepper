2008-10-31T12:02:00.000Z	PeterBye		well Jon said we could call them anytime for tech support but he didn't give me the number before he went on vacation

2008-10-31T12:03:00.000Z	reqqit	PeterBye	where did Jon go on holiday?
2008-10-31T12:04:00.000Z	reqqit	PeterBye	does Jon like you? Or is he a little cold with you?
2008-10-31T12:05:00.000Z	reqqit	PeterBye	give him credit, he does more than wiring and stuff
2008-10-31T12:06:00.000Z	reqqit	PeterBye	my guess is Jon doesn't like you Pete, and wanted to palm off having to support your inane queries about the computer system while he was diving for treasure. :(
2008-10-31T12:07:00.000Z	reqqit	PeterBye	Jon told me that he left you Mike Hunt's number
2008-10-31T12:07:00.000Z	reqqit	PeterBye	maybe someone there knows Mike's number
2008-10-31T12:09:00.000Z	reqqit	PeterBye	Jon was clear, but I don't have Mike's extension number, go and ask around see if anyone has him on their lists
2008-10-31T12:10:00.000Z	reqqit	PeterBye	I told you, go and ask some other people in your department if their have seen Mike Hunt anywhere around, he can fix it
2008-10-31T12:10:00.000Z	PeterBye	reqqit	i already tried that - the only one here now is Jerry and he didn't answer my question
2008-10-31T12:10:00.000Z	reqqit	PeterBye	ask jerry if he has seen Mike Hunt lately
2008-10-31T12:11:00.000Z	PeterBye	reqqit	i asked him - he didn't answer he just turned around at his desk
2008-10-31T12:11:00.000Z	reqqit	PeterBye	Demand that he tells you what he thinks of Mike Hunt
