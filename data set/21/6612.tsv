2007-03-08T14:35:00.000Z	crdlb	pauldaoust	that's it (it's in the topic :) )
2007-03-08T14:30:00.000Z	crdlb	pauldaoust	please pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2007-03-08T14:33:00.000Z	crdlb	pauldaoust	please pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2007-03-08T14:33:00.000Z	pauldaoust	crdlb	working on it; pastebin is reallllly slow right now
2007-03-08T14:33:00.000Z	crdlb	pauldaoust	use the ubuntu pastebin
2007-03-08T14:35:00.000Z	pauldaoust	crdlb	found it. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9293/
2007-03-08T14:35:00.000Z	pauldaoust	crdlb	not sure if that's the Ubuntu pastebin you meant, but...
2007-03-08T14:36:00.000Z	pauldaoust	crdlb	dang. I shoulda read the topic :-S
2007-03-08T14:39:00.000Z	pauldaoust	crdlb	anything untoward? I did notice that the display device was recognised as CRT-0; I don't know if that means it wasn't detected properly through DPMS.... or what.
2007-03-08T14:40:00.000Z	crdlb	pauldaoust	pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf for completeness
2007-03-08T14:43:00.000Z	pauldaoust	crdlb	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9294/
2007-03-08T14:46:00.000Z	crdlb	pauldaoust	you have two monitors?
2007-03-08T14:47:00.000Z	pauldaoust	crdlb	no; I did a while ago, but I don't anymore. It didn't seem to hurt to have the TwinView stuff in xorg.conf, even with only one monitor, so I left it in there.
2007-03-08T14:48:00.000Z	crdlb	pauldaoust	try commenting the twinview stuff out
2007-03-08T14:55:00.000Z	pauldaoust	crdlb	well, I've made the requisite changes to xorg.conf; I'm gonna restart my session.
2007-03-08T14:58:00.000Z	pauldaoust	crdlb	thanks; that worked like a charm! I have no idea why it caused problems out of the blue like that...
2007-03-08T15:00:00.000Z	crdlb	pauldaoust	generally the simpler a config file is, the better it will run :)
2007-03-08T15:00:00.000Z	pauldaoust	crdlb	you're probably right. I'm sure you noticed all the config bits I left in there, for all the different video cards and monitors I plug into it on occasion...
2007-03-08T15:01:00.000Z	crdlb	pauldaoust	most of that config is not loaded because it is not referenced by the ServerLayout section, so those parts can be left alone
2007-03-08T15:02:00.000Z	pauldaoust	crdlb	oh, that's good. I thought it loaded them, probed the hardware, etc even before it got to the ServerLayout section. Anyway, thanks again for the help, and now I've gotta start work!
