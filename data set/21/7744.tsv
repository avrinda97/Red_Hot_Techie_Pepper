2010-06-27T21:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MBG1987	Which version of Dreamweaver?
2010-06-27T21:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MBG1987	to be honest, there are some alright WYSIWYG 's for  Desktop Linux, but none of them are as good as Dreamweaver really
2010-06-27T21:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MBG1987	no I meant hrm as in like thinking
2010-06-27T21:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MBG1987	the good news is
2010-06-27T21:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MBG1987	you can probably Wine Dreamweaver quite nicely, but may hae to set it up a bit
2010-06-27T21:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MBG1987	also with enough RAM and such, you can run it in a Windows virtual machine
2010-06-27T21:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MBG1987	not if you set the vm up properly it won't I guess
2010-06-27T21:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MBG1987	ask the developers of it or something
2010-06-27T21:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MBG1987	Ubuntu Tweak is not an offical  Ubuntu program
