2009-05-09T19:27:00.000Z	Lademord		Someone help, please. I am running jaunty, and have installed the adobe-flashplugin and flashplugin-installer packages, but I still cannot play YouTube-videos - I simply get a black square where the video is supposed to be
2009-05-09T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lademord	does it show in about: plugins
2009-05-09T19:34:00.000Z	Lademord	ActionParsnip	yes it does
2009-05-09T19:41:00.000Z	Lademord	ActionParsnip	any ideas? It shows up in the plugin section so I guess it is installed correctly. Also, the flash  animation at http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/ shows fine (albeit without sound)
2009-05-09T19:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lademord	are you running a 64bit ubuntu?
2009-05-09T19:41:00.000Z	Lademord	ActionParsnip	no I'm not
2009-05-09T19:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lademord	weird, 32bit is usually awesome with flash, you could download the tar.gz from www.adobe.com
2009-05-09T19:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lademord	and put the .so file in n~/.moziila/plugins
2009-05-09T20:02:00.000Z	Lademord	ActionParsnip	erhm... there is no plugins folder in ~/.mozilla
2009-05-09T20:07:00.000Z	Lademord	ActionParsnip	where did you go?
2009-05-09T20:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lademord	?
2009-05-09T20:08:00.000Z	Lademord	ActionParsnip	there is no ~/.mozilla/plugins folder
2009-05-09T20:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lademord	you need to make it: mkdir ~/.mozilla/plugins
2009-05-09T20:12:00.000Z	Lademord	ActionParsnip	damn that doesn't work either
2009-05-09T20:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lademord	thats how i always do it, the repo never works for me, its another way to tackle it
2009-05-09T20:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lademord	i know of it but i think they do the same deal. you could try: sudo apt-get --purge remove flashplayer-*; sudo apt-get --purge autoremove; sudo apt-get clean; sudo apt-get install flashplayer-nonfree
2009-08-26T00:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lademord	boot to live cd or root recovery mode and run fsck
2009-08-26T00:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lademord	and get a new drie. Make sure your backups are recent
2009-08-26T00:39:00.000Z	Lademord	ActionParsnip	how do I run fsck? Just Terminal -> 'fsck' ?
2009-08-26T00:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lademord	they are parts of the drive that are physically damaged
2009-08-26T00:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lademord	if you need drive speed then scsi can help. You need special hardware for scsi
