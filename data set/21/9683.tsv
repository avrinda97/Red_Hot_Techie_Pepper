2005-07-31T08:22:00.000Z	Vytas		Hello, I've helped my friend with his ubuntu on various issues, but now I'm puzzled myself
2005-07-31T08:22:00.000Z	Vytas		Is it an easy way to use maromedia-flash on amd64?
2005-07-31T08:23:00.000Z	Vytas		*macromedia
2005-07-31T08:23:00.000Z	bob2	Vytas	you have to ask macromedia to port it
2005-07-31T08:23:00.000Z	Vytas	bob2	there are some ways to use 32bit firefox
2005-07-31T08:24:00.000Z	bob2	Vytas	not really
2005-07-31T08:24:00.000Z	bob2	Vytas	perhaps i386 mozilla from mozilla.org with ia32-libs would work
2005-07-31T08:26:00.000Z	bob2	Vytas	they don't appear to be
2005-07-31T08:26:00.000Z	Vytas	bob2	have you tried them yourself?
2005-07-31T08:26:00.000Z	bob2	Vytas	no, I don't use flash at all
2005-07-31T08:34:00.000Z	bob2	Vytas	you don't generally use gui tools for that
2005-07-31T08:34:00.000Z	Vytas	bob2	I want to know
2005-07-31T08:34:00.000Z	bob2	Vytas	you edit /etc/fstab once and leave it alone
2005-07-31T08:34:00.000Z	bob2	Vytas	for dynamic things (like usb hard disks), they get mounted automatically
2005-07-31T08:34:00.000Z	Vytas	bob2	but partitions don't
2005-07-31T08:35:00.000Z	Vytas	bob2	yes
2005-07-31T08:36:00.000Z	bob2	Vytas	why not just automate it?
2005-07-31T08:36:00.000Z	Vytas	bob2	but automating at install time
2005-07-31T08:37:00.000Z	Vytas	bob2	that's a good idea
2005-07-31T08:37:00.000Z	Vytas	bob2	it isn't at the moment
2005-07-31T08:38:00.000Z	Vytas	bob2	by the way, I tried it on hoary today
