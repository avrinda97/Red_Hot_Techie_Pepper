2007-05-16T09:39:00.000Z	danny3793		By the way guys, i must say, Linux handles my Nvidia card/chipset MUCH better than Vista did :D
2007-05-16T09:39:00.000Z	Khrajin	danny3793	The only thing Vista is good for is a door-stop.
2007-05-16T09:42:00.000Z	Khrajin	danny3793	:P sounsd painful, but symbolically acceptable
2007-05-16T09:43:00.000Z	danny3793	Khrajin	xD, Even when my gfx card was on the restricted drivers, it ran better than on Vista, i wish i could use some programs like i can use on Windows, but thats way less than what Linux has given me so far :D
2007-05-16T09:44:00.000Z	Khrajin	danny3793	I'm only on windows for a few reasons: 1 World of Warcraft 2: Progress Quest. Although I havn't tried PQ in Wine yet.
2007-05-16T09:45:00.000Z	danny3793	Khrajin	I am using WoW perfectly with Cedega, im getting 60FPS inside of Stormwind :P
2007-05-16T09:45:00.000Z	Khrajin	danny3793	Don't you have to pay for Cedega?
2007-05-16T09:46:00.000Z	danny3793	Khrajin	yes, but its $15 (3 month min. purchase) and then if you no longer pay for the sub. you dont get updates, but you still get to use the program ;)
2007-05-16T09:46:00.000Z	Khrajin	danny3793	Free WoW on XP or 15$ for the same thing and not needing to reboot... Hmm..
2007-05-16T09:46:00.000Z	danny3793	Khrajin	id go with the $15 one time fee, just so i dont have to reboot ;)
2007-05-16T09:47:00.000Z	Khrajin	danny3793	lol, I'm fine with rebooting for now. We'll see in a few weeks as I transition to Kubuntu nearly 100%
2007-05-16T09:47:00.000Z	Khrajin	danny3793	I have an ATI Radeon 1400 Mobility and Fiesty isn't <3ing it.
2007-05-16T09:48:00.000Z	danny3793	Khrajin	ahhh, ATI :S, that sucks lol
2007-05-16T09:58:00.000Z	Khrajin	danny3793	What other games have you tried on Cedega?
2007-05-16T09:58:00.000Z	danny3793	Khrajin	just WoW xD, i may try a few others just to see how they handle, such as Civ4, C&C3, and maybe AoE: 3
