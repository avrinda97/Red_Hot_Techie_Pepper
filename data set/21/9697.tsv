2005-07-27T06:47:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker		i have kubuntu, and i also have ubuntu livecd, im currently out of cd's and bandwidth, is it possible to use the stuff off livecd to switch the kubuntu installed over to gnome?
2005-07-27T06:47:00.000Z	Seveas	Chris_Tucker	no, the live cd contains no packages
2005-07-27T06:47:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	Seveas	damn .. that sucks
2005-07-27T06:56:00.000Z	Seveas	Chris_Tucker	what kind of os are you on now?
2005-07-27T06:57:00.000Z	Seveas	Chris_Tucker	I guess the best option is to download the ubuntu installer iso and use that at home to install ubuntu-desktop
2005-07-27T06:59:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	Seveas	is there a way to get teh ubuntu-desktop and its requisites .debs via what i have (livecd and w98)?
2005-07-27T06:59:00.000Z	Seveas	Chris_Tucker	it is possible but very difficult because you will have to figure out all dependencies yourself
2005-07-27T07:00:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	Seveas	not if what im trying rigth now works, if it does, synaptic will tell me them
2005-07-27T07:00:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	Seveas	how, if i know them?
2005-07-27T07:45:00.000Z	Seveas	Chris_Tucker	sudo chmod -x /etc/init.d/ntpdate
2005-07-27T12:06:00.000Z	Seveas	Chris_Tucker	apt-cache show $packagename
2005-07-28T11:02:00.000Z	Seveas	Chris_Tucker	but Ubuntu does not include the realtime stuff patches to the kernel
2005-09-10T14:12:00.000Z	Seveas	Chris_Tucker	you need ndiswrapper
2005-09-30T13:07:00.000Z	Seveas	Chris_Tucker	system -> admin -> printing
2005-09-30T13:08:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	Seveas	what would the username and password for the default be?
2005-09-30T13:09:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	Seveas	what would the username and password for the default be?
2005-09-30T13:10:00.000Z	Seveas	Chris_Tucker	default what?
2005-09-30T13:10:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	Seveas	if there is no password, persay, that the user sees, any windows computer on the network can print to the printer in question without entering a password
2005-09-30T13:11:00.000Z	Seveas	Chris_Tucker	then don't enter one
2005-09-30T13:12:00.000Z	Seveas	Chris_Tucker	wouldn't know...
2006-02-20T06:25:00.000Z	Seveas	Chris_Tucker	c:\Program Files (or even having c:\ and d:\) is an utterly broken concept
