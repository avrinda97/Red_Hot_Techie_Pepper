2010-09-14T03:31:00.000Z	wippler		ok, I'll do that now.....but another question: some people suggested that you need to get it to boot with resolution of 1024x600 by changing a Xorg.conf file.....but I can't find this anywhere (or the ETC folder for that matter)
2010-09-14T03:31:00.000Z	wippler		haha, you've given me your time, I'm grateful for that Emanon

2010-09-14T03:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wippler	the file doesnt exist by default but if one exists, it will be obeyed
2010-09-14T03:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wippler	if you use this: http://idyllictux.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/lucidubuntu-10-04-high-resolution-plymouth-virtual-terminal-for-atinvidia-cards-with-proprietaryrestricted-driver/   until the embedded video, you can set the boot res
2010-09-14T03:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wippler	if one doesnt exist (default in Lucid) then udev will attempt to detect stuff, sometimes it works, sometimes not
2010-09-14T03:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wippler	you just need to edit /etc/X11/org.conf and find samples online. If you want to make a skeleton file, boot to root recovery mode and run: Xorg --configure
2010-09-14T03:42:00.000Z	wippler	ActionParsnip	untill now I think it doesn't exist (searched the flash drive), but where do I put the file if I want it to be obeyed by default?
2010-09-14T03:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wippler	run: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf   you now have write access to the file.
2010-09-14T03:43:00.000Z	wippler	ActionParsnip	there's an example over here, and I've got the Xorg.conf file from there   -------->>>> http://webbookblog.com/reinstalling-ubuntu-or-other-linux-on-the-webbook/
2010-09-14T03:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wippler	cool, copy it in and reboot, if its good, cool. You can tweak with more options to get (maybe) better performance
2010-09-14T03:45:00.000Z	wippler	ActionParsnip	copy it to the root or  syslinux or......there's lots of folders :P
2010-09-14T03:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wippler	whatever gets you write access to the file
2010-09-14T03:47:00.000Z	wippler	ActionParsnip	Um....I already have write access because I'm using the USB as a regular drive right now......after I copy Xorg.conf to it, I'll plug it into the webbook and begin installing.....but the thing is I don't know where exactly the Xorg.conf is supposed to go (trying to clear it up for you :D )
2010-09-14T03:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wippler	if you read the xorg.conf is very readbale
2010-09-14T03:51:00.000Z	wippler	ActionParsnip	oh ok.....thanks! I don't see a ETC folder, so i'm assuming I can just make a new  etc/x11 then put the Xorg.conf in there?
2010-09-14T03:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wippler	the X11 (not x11) folder, already exists
