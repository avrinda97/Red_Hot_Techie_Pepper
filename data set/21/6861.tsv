2007-04-03T13:11:00.000Z	jshriver		greetings
2007-04-03T13:11:00.000Z	jshriver		I'm looking at my weblogs and I see I have a good bit of traffic coming from arpanet, what is this now adays?
2007-04-03T13:12:00.000Z	jshriver		Anyone else get arpanet on their weblogs?
2007-04-03T13:14:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	Do you mean records that have feilds like 'xxx.xx.xx.in-addr-arpa' ? or do they explicitly say arpanet?
2007-10-18T22:24:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	they should be up
2007-10-18T22:25:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	not yet.
2008-02-08T21:01:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	have you tried just: apt-get source libjpeg ?
2008-12-18T23:53:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	Right click on the top of the menu and go to edit menus.
2010-03-10T23:02:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	Generally you don't want to do that, but you can do: gpg -d 0 < some_file_with_the_passphrase
2010-03-10T23:03:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	Er, my brain had an oops its: gpg --passphrase-fd 0 < some_file_with_the_passphrase   OR if your gpg version supports it you can use --pasphrase-file thefilename
2010-03-10T23:04:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	Oh. and it looks like some versions of gpg also support putting --passphrase theactualpassphrase
2010-03-10T23:04:00.000Z	jshriver	Pici	hrm might have to do that then.  Problem is my password is dynamic changes daily so I dont store it in plain text.  Is there another way to specify it?
2010-03-10T23:05:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	That seems to be available in the version thats in Karmic.  I know that on a RedHat install that I use those are not available.
2010-04-19T19:57:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	: Please join #ubuntu+1 for Lucid/10.04 support/discussion.
2010-04-23T21:16:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	for a whole bunch of files? or just for one?
2010-04-23T21:17:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	rename 's/\.mp3.*/.mp3/' SModcast-*
2010-04-23T21:21:00.000Z	jshriver	Pici	you rock
2010-08-09T21:03:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	I'd guess gnome-volume-manager (for managing volumes, not sound)
2010-08-09T21:04:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	Its not used in >= karmic
2012-01-09T22:17:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	Karmic is no longer supported. Its repositories are no longer online.
2012-01-09T22:18:00.000Z	Pici	jshriver	If you really really really need to use them, they can be found at old-releases.ubuntu.com, but you really really really should consider upgrading to 10.04
