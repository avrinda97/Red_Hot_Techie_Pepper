2004-12-23T14:18:00.000Z	gangalino		how do you configure the soundcard, my system beeps but it says there's no soundcard (even though it shows up in the system configuration/device mgr. as a NeoMagic 2360 [MagicMedia 256ZX audio] 
2004-12-23T14:18:00.000Z	gangalino		I've already tried the noacpi options
