2010-03-21T09:45:00.000Z	FriGiN		Morning everyone. anyone wanna help out a newbie to ubuntu with an install question
2010-03-21T09:45:00.000Z	DasEi	FriGiN	ask
2010-03-21T09:52:00.000Z	DasEi	FriGiN	you will have to delete sda5 to get it one space
2010-03-21T09:53:00.000Z	DasEi	FriGiN	are you using the desktop-live cd ?
2010-03-21T09:54:00.000Z	DasEi	FriGiN	additional question, have you got a (small) additional, free usb-stick ?
2010-03-21T09:56:00.000Z	DasEi	FriGiN	k, that's just an extracautious idea, backup the working mbr, case things go wrong, so win is still intact; as I got you you got a grub now with win, but not ubu working
2010-03-21T09:57:00.000Z	DasEi	FriGiN	no, ubu installs wherever you like it, but to resize, spaces have to be next to each other
2010-03-21T09:58:00.000Z	DasEi	FriGiN	for hibernating it is important , if you got more then enough ram, don't really need swap that big
2010-03-21T10:00:00.000Z	DasEi	FriGiN	yep, at 2 gig systemram, I'd place a swap also apart from suspend
2010-03-21T10:01:00.000Z	FriGiN	DasEi	how do you mean place a swap also apart from suspend
2010-03-21T10:02:00.000Z	DasEi	FriGiN	swap is needed if apps consumed the ram, 2 gigs are not too less, but are reachable by heavy usage
2010-03-21T10:03:00.000Z	FriGiN	DasEi	yup understand that. but you said apart.. so another swap space?
2010-03-21T10:03:00.000Z	DasEi	FriGiN	in spite of was meant
2010-03-21T10:04:00.000Z	FriGiN	DasEi	so one single 2048 swap and a 60019 working part should be sufficient is what your telling me correct?
2010-03-21T10:04:00.000Z	DasEi	FriGiN	yes
2010-03-21T10:04:00.000Z	FriGiN	DasEi	awesome thy
2010-03-21T10:05:00.000Z	DasEi	FriGiN	just pick a empty usb stick, boot live, get it done
2010-03-21T10:05:00.000Z	DasEi	FriGiN	go ahead
2010-03-21T10:07:00.000Z	DasEi	FriGiN	you can do it later, either have an extra data partiton there, or , if you put the nix-partition (root) as you called it, next to it, can enlarge the ubuntu-one to that space
2010-03-21T10:08:00.000Z	FriGiN	DasEi	tyvm thats what i had thought.. just been so long since i did anything in linux i feel like a newborn all over.
2010-03-21T10:08:00.000Z	DasEi	FriGiN	be welcome
