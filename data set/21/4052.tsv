2010-11-12T01:13:00.000Z	gamerpro2000		Can someone please look at my bug report and at least give me a workaround.  I'm getting desperate: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/674112
2010-11-12T01:14:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	if there is no work around in the bug report, one has not yet been released
2010-11-12T01:17:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	what do you want from us ?
2010-11-12T01:17:00.000Z	gamerpro2000	ikonia	I would ust like a bit of help to eliminate the segmentation fault.  I've been screaming for help for over two months
2010-11-12T01:17:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	ok - so how can we do that ?
2010-11-12T01:18:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	yes, but even if I do, it's not going to "fix" it
2010-11-12T01:18:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	you need to log a bug, and wait for it to be progressed, talking in here isn't going to get a patch released
2010-11-12T01:19:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	ok, so you need to progress the bug
2010-11-12T01:19:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	well, log a bug, provide feed back in it, work with the package maintainers
2010-11-12T01:21:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	you don't want to be changing xorg versions
2010-11-12T01:21:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	you want to be progressing the bug
2010-11-12T01:21:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	someone else was in early with the same problem exactly
2010-11-12T01:22:00.000Z	gamerpro2000	ikonia	leprechau thank you guys a lot :)
2010-11-12T01:27:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	don't do it
2010-11-12T01:27:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	progress the bug with people who know what they are doing
2010-11-12T01:28:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	if you can't even find the source - your out of your league, progess the bug with people who understand it
2010-11-12T01:28:00.000Z	gamerpro2000	ikonia	how do I progress a bug report?
2010-11-12T01:28:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	as I told you earlier, log the bug, pass notes on it, chase the bug owner, find the package maintainers, push them to put a fix in place, get it filtered down the chain
2010-11-12T01:29:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	a seg fault is not going to get fixed over night
2010-11-12T01:29:00.000Z	ikonia	gamerpro2000	accept it, push the bug hard and work on it
2010-11-12T01:29:00.000Z	gamerpro2000	ikonia	appreciated.  Thank you.
