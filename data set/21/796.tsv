2011-08-22T08:09:00.000Z	nykur		(just reposting in case someone who just joined knows...) My wireless connection is very jumpy. Using a realtek chip and the rtl8192ce module
2011-08-22T08:11:00.000Z	hylian	nykur	are you asking a question? (i don't think i caught it...)
2011-08-22T08:12:00.000Z	nykur	hylian	Yes, I'm having serious issues with my wireless. Don't even know where too start troubleshooting
2011-08-22T08:12:00.000Z	hylian	nykur	ohh boy... well i can try and help ya.
2011-08-22T08:13:00.000Z	nykur	hylian	Many thanks! I'll try to describe the issue...
2011-08-22T08:14:00.000Z	nykur	hylian	It will work for a short period of time, then slow down to a halt, even though it says it's connected
2011-08-22T08:16:00.000Z	hylian	nykur	strange. when it does, can you try and ping google.com? have you seen if there is any net communications for anything, any port? although i don't know why that would happen.. maybe it's a hardware issue, are you using ndiswrapper?
2011-08-22T08:18:00.000Z	nykur	hylian	It will work perfectly for a minute, sometimes longer. Then it's like it gets clogged. it'll stay connected but I can't actually connect to anything. I am not using ndiswrapper, maybe I should?
2011-08-22T08:18:00.000Z	hylian	nykur	what hardware are you using?
2011-08-22T08:20:00.000Z	nykur	hylian	Realtek RTL8188ce wifi adapter on a Toshiba Satellite Pro c660. Should I be more specific?
2011-08-22T08:21:00.000Z	nykur	hylian	Do you want output from any particular command?
2011-08-22T08:22:00.000Z	hylian	nykur	no that's good. hmmm.. i'll be honest, i've never had any serious problems with wifi in linux, but i am gonna take a look, brb
2011-08-22T08:22:00.000Z	nykur	hylian	thanks
2011-08-22T08:25:00.000Z	nykur	hylian	The funny thing is I used to have another Satellite runnning Xubuntu for years, but it suddenly started acting this way sometime after Hardy or Intrepid.
2011-08-22T08:27:00.000Z	hylian	nykur	ok, i managed to dig up that there is a new driver for that card, and this is a problem with the 11.04, and i think the 10's. here's the link to where i got my info: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1814675
2011-08-22T08:28:00.000Z	hylian	nykur	so i think yuo need to implement the new driver...
2011-08-22T08:28:00.000Z	nykur	hylian	nice, thanks! I'll look into it. I just have to find the driver now:-)
2011-08-22T08:29:00.000Z	hylian	nykur	there is a link to the driver, i believe, on that website.
2011-08-22T08:31:00.000Z	nykur	hylian	yes I saw it now thanks. I'll try this. For what it's worth I can confirm that the 3.0 kernel in LMDE does not fix this. Running Natty now so hopefully this will:-)
2011-08-22T08:31:00.000Z	hylian	nykur	hope it helps! :)
2011-08-22T08:32:00.000Z	nykur	hylian	Me to;-)
