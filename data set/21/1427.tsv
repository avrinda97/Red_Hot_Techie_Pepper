2010-09-16T17:37:00.000Z	beefncheese		any help with getting a terminator to run a command as i open for example archey
2010-09-16T17:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	beefncheese	 i seem to recall terminator taking the same options as gnome-terminal does for that. Since it is using gnome-terminal
2010-09-16T17:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	beefncheese	   terminator -e vim
2010-09-16T17:39:00.000Z	beefncheese	Dr_Willis	so how would i go about getting the terminal to run the command "archey" as i open it
2010-09-16T17:44:00.000Z	beefncheese	Dr_Willis	hey figured out i needa edit myh .bashrc. Is this correct
2010-09-16T17:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	beefncheese	 'terminator -e COMMANDTORUN'    no need to msee with the bashrc
