2008-11-07T09:50:00.000Z	erikg		upgraded to intrepid and now my X keyboard configuration is borked
2008-11-07T09:50:00.000Z	erikg		the left arrow key is alt
2008-11-07T09:50:00.000Z	erikg		the up arrow key is NoSymbol
2008-11-07T09:51:00.000Z	erikg		the windows key is NoSymbol
2008-11-07T09:51:00.000Z	jrib	erikg	i've seen that issue a couple of times (unless you were here before).  Try checking bugs.ubuntu.com for an open bug
2008-11-07T09:51:00.000Z	erikg	jrib	great
2008-11-07T09:51:00.000Z	erikg	jrib	will do
2008-11-07T09:52:00.000Z	jrib	erikg	one possible workaround would be to revert to your old xorg.conf for the keyboard setup or just make hal not use evdev for your keyboard (that's my guess)
2008-11-07T09:52:00.000Z	erikg	jrib	reconfiguring xorg.conf didn't work
2008-11-07T09:53:00.000Z	erikg	jrib	hal is behaving like a certain computer which they once sent to one of the moons of jupiter
2008-11-07T09:53:00.000Z	jrib	erikg	not reconfiguring.  Use your old one and add the right option so it's used for configuring input devices (man xorg.conf, search for hal)
2008-11-07T09:54:00.000Z	jrib	erikg	are you on intrepid?
2008-11-07T09:54:00.000Z	jrib	erikg	it's there
2008-11-07T09:54:00.000Z	erikg	jrib	Hal?
2008-11-07T09:54:00.000Z	jrib	erikg	HAL
2008-11-07T09:55:00.000Z	erikg	jrib	ohh... maybe the upgrade didn't complete and i still have the  old xserver
2008-11-07T09:55:00.000Z	jrib	erikg	X -version
2008-11-07T09:56:00.000Z	erikg	jrib	2:1.4.1
2008-11-07T09:57:00.000Z	jrib	erikg	yep, you're right about being on the old X server
2008-11-07T09:57:00.000Z	erikg	jrib	i'm dist-upgrading now
2008-11-07T09:57:00.000Z	erikg	jrib	it hadn't completed because of conflicts
