2012-09-21T08:07:00.000Z	tomreyn	Vivekananda	http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/
2012-09-21T08:10:00.000Z	Vivekananda	tomreyn	I am there but how do I locate which file to view coz there is no file named #ubuntu only
2012-09-21T08:10:00.000Z	tomreyn	Vivekananda	there is. http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2012/09/21/%23ubuntu.html
2012-09-21T08:13:00.000Z	Vivekananda	tomreyn	I got it thanks
2012-09-21T08:13:00.000Z	tomreyn	Vivekananda	this internet address i posted cntains a calendar date in reverse notation.
2012-09-21T08:17:00.000Z	Vivekananda	tomreyn	I got it thanks. The one question I ask and am confused quite often is for example I am installing abs-guide now coz I need it now but in a few days i wont and then how do I know what programs I have installed already on my laptop and also what did I install something for
2012-09-21T08:21:00.000Z	tomreyn	Vivekananda	there is software-center which can tell you what's already installed, sorted into categories. there's also synaptic and a couple other package managers which could tell.
2012-09-21T08:22:00.000Z	tomreyn	Vivekananda	to get a full list of all installed packages, run "dpkg -l" in a terminal window. to inspect previously installed packages, look at /var/log/apt/history.log
2012-09-21T08:24:00.000Z	Vivekananda	tomreyn	sofware-centre , If I understand correctly only tells me about the gui packages installed. I am looking for the non gui ones . Also is !apt  a command ?
2012-09-21T08:27:00.000Z	tomreyn	Vivekananda	if you type !apt here in the chat alone on a single line, then ubottu, the friendly channel bot, will consider this a command and respond to it. it is not a common command on ubuntu's command line interface, i.e. the linux shell, though.
2012-09-21T08:33:00.000Z	Vivekananda	tomreyn	alos I installed abs-guide but how do I run it on the cmd
2012-09-21T08:36:00.000Z	tomreyn	Vivekananda	this is a book, i don't think it is meant ot be 'run'.
2012-09-21T08:37:00.000Z	tomreyn	Vivekananda	run "dpkg -L abs-guide" to get a list of all files which were placed on your computer when this package was installed
2012-09-21T08:38:00.000Z	Vivekananda	tomreyn	I meant that if it is a book how do I go through it like a tutorial or something
2012-09-21T08:39:00.000Z	tomreyn	Vivekananda	i have not used it before, but based on the files it contains, which are mostly html and shell skript files in an 'examples' subdirectory, you seem to be supposed to point your web browser to file:///usr/share/doc/abs-guide/html/ to get started
2012-09-21T08:46:00.000Z	tomreyn	Vivekananda	have fun learning shell skripting. if i was to recommend adidtional resources, i'd point you to #bash here on freenode as well as well as the bash related pages on this wiki http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ (a great resource)
2012-09-21T08:49:00.000Z	Vivekananda	tomreyn	thanks
2012-09-21T08:56:00.000Z	tomreyn	Vivekananda	unless: You're both welcome. ;-)
2012-09-21T09:19:00.000Z	Vivekananda	tomreyn	so after I finish learning shell script and cron jobs I am still not sure if I will be able to set up a backup rsync system where if it does not run at a specific time it pops up an error whenever I next switch on the system or sth
2012-09-21T09:23:00.000Z	tomreyn	Vivekananda	you will also need to read the rsync man page, and possibly something on how you make such messages pop up. but besides that, you may well be able to do so by then.
