2006-12-18T09:05:00.000Z	dabaR	malt	change permissions to only allow either 0 or 1 as the others(world) permission. (sudo chmod 711 /home/*)
2006-12-18T09:06:00.000Z	dabaR	malt	they are not a lock on exit, they are a lock on entrance, permissions are.
2006-12-18T09:07:00.000Z	malt	dabaR	will 711 make them stick to there directory?
2006-12-18T09:07:00.000Z	dabaR	malt	it will make them not go into other people's dirs if all the dirs have that permission
2006-12-18T09:08:00.000Z	dabaR	malt	I told you the right permission. sudo chmod 711 /home/*
2006-12-18T09:15:00.000Z	malt	dabaR	it also lets them view other stuff on my server thats not him when they view files for example like /etc/
2006-12-18T09:19:00.000Z	dabaR	malt	ask in #ubuntu-desktop, or #ubuntu-motu
2006-12-18T09:20:00.000Z	dabaR	malt	no, not you.
