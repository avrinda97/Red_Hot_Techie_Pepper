2006-08-06T10:41:00.000Z	HackerX_	Flannel	doesnt have the sources to get those
2006-08-06T10:42:00.000Z	Flannel	HackerX_	did you add the source repositories to your repository list?

2006-08-06T10:43:00.000Z	HackerX_	Flannel	im using all that are in  there
2006-08-06T10:43:00.000Z	Flannel	HackerX_	hmm?  have you added the source repositories?
2006-08-06T10:44:00.000Z	Flannel	HackerX_	and you updated your cache after that?
2006-08-06T10:44:00.000Z	Flannel	HackerX_	try downloading those files by themselves, since they're apparently what are in the repositories.  You shouldnt get any problems
2006-08-06T10:46:00.000Z	HackerX_	Flannel	where from?
2006-08-06T10:46:00.000Z	Flannel	HackerX_	the repositories, main I imagine.

2006-08-06T10:55:00.000Z	HackerX_	Flannel	ok well this laptop is going threw a window real soon. i had to reinstall and i had it b4 someone game me a apt-get command that fixed everything but i cant figure out what it was
2006-08-06T10:56:00.000Z	Flannel	HackerX_	you'll have to look at other repositories, GAIM might have a repository for it.  If it's a dependency of some package you got, then I imagine itll be getable where you got that package
