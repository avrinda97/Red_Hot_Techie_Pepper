2006-03-07T14:27:00.000Z	slabby		I have installed all fine apart from one problem it wouldnt auto find my network so I config'd it myself. I am pretty sure ive done it right. Then when the install was all finished (or so i believe). It started to load then came up with and error on X server. It offers me information about the error and says to check for new versions of X server in the internet, and when reading further down it says "no screens found"

2006-03-07T14:34:00.000Z	slabby		hope that makes sense
2006-03-07T14:34:00.000Z	cmpalmer	slabby	your problem is not a network problem
2006-03-07T14:34:00.000Z	cmpalmer	slabby	look at the errors it gives you
2006-03-07T14:34:00.000Z	cmpalmer	slabby	that will tell you what you need to fix when you reconfigure xorg
2006-03-07T14:36:00.000Z	slabby	cmpalmer	stupendo44 : what do i need to do then? do you want more info from the error?
2006-03-07T14:47:00.000Z	cmpalmer	slabby	then your xorg.conf is telling xorg to look for something other than your video card
2006-03-07T14:59:00.000Z	cmpalmer	slabby	try that
2006-03-07T14:49:00.000Z	slabby	cmpalmer	: I have a Radeon X800 - PCI express
2006-03-07T14:49:00.000Z	cmpalmer	slabby	yes
2006-03-07T14:53:00.000Z	cmpalmer	slabby	try the ati driver
2006-03-07T14:57:00.000Z	cmpalmer	slabby	correct
2006-03-07T15:01:00.000Z	slabby	cmpalmer	it is 64bit still ok?
