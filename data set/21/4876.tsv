2010-11-12T04:16:00.000Z	Firefishe	rww	I've seen that page, and my setup is different, somehow.
2010-11-12T04:16:00.000Z	Firefishe	rww	 The 'Regional and Language' section isn't in the place those instructions say it is.
2010-11-12T04:17:00.000Z	rww	Firefishe	ah. I think some of the System Settings stuff got moved around in KDE 4.5. I don't have it handy to look for where it moved to, though >.>
2010-11-12T04:17:00.000Z	rww	Firefishe	It'll be in there somewhere, though.
2010-11-12T04:18:00.000Z	Firefishe	rww	 I'm looking for it, but it's possibly not there anymore.
2011-02-23T03:54:00.000Z	rww	Firefishe	not really, no
2011-02-23T03:54:00.000Z	Firefishe	rww	jrib:  thank you, I thought as much
2011-02-23T03:54:00.000Z	rww	Firefishe	if you stay on 10.04, you have the benefit of it being an LTS, so it's supported for 3 years (instead of 18 months) and can be upgraded directly to the next LTS when it comes out.
2011-02-23T03:55:00.000Z	Firefishe	rww	 really?  I did not know that about the LTS releases.  I have no problems with lucid, in fact, it's been the most stable u(k)(x)ubuntu I've used.
2011-02-23T03:57:00.000Z	Firefishe	rww	 backports keeps kde up to date, so I'm good there.  Haven't had a chance to try the new gnome yet...is there a way to try it out in a stand-alone fashion, perhaps?
2011-02-23T03:57:00.000Z	rww	Firefishe	put it on a USB stick and try it in Live USB?
2011-02-23T03:57:00.000Z	Firefishe	rww	 I guess that'd work.  usb images are on the main site, correct?
2011-02-23T03:58:00.000Z	rww	Firefishe	you use the normal ISO image with Startup Disk Creator (found under System -> Administration, I think)
2011-03-16T10:58:00.000Z	rww	Firefishe	no, that's Debian.
2011-03-16T10:58:00.000Z	Firefishe	rww	 Egads!  Please!  Smite me!
2011-03-16T10:59:00.000Z	rww	Firefishe	I would have better standing to do this if I didn't use squeeze ;)
2011-03-16T10:59:00.000Z	Firefishe	rww	 gotcha
2011-08-18T23:33:00.000Z	rww	Firefishe	yes
2011-08-18T23:34:00.000Z	Firefishe	rww	 thank you
2011-08-18T23:34:00.000Z	Firefishe	rww	 nice to see you again, btw...been a while :)
