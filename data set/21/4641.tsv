2008-03-16T02:33:00.000Z	bazhang	albyyx	what seems to be the issue?
2008-03-16T02:34:00.000Z	albyyx		well as i told you installed kde and removed it with sudo aptitude, to that point. all fine, but the kde apps keep on being in my gnome menu, like amarok konkeror and others, now i've launched a synaptic and checking for kde i see them all under the gnome icon, like if they were still installed
2008-03-16T02:34:00.000Z	albyyx		that's more or less it bazhang  so i wanted to make sure that i can remove them from synaptic without danger
2008-03-16T02:35:00.000Z	bazhang		http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/puregnome albyyx will get rid of all kde stuff
2008-03-16T02:35:00.000Z	albyyx		nope bazhang  already did it, and it's still there
2008-03-16T02:35:00.000Z	albyyx		yet, when i type the sudo aptitude, it says no packages to remove
2008-03-16T02:37:00.000Z	bazhang	albyyx	try launching one of the kde apps and see what happens
2008-03-16T02:38:00.000Z	albyyx		they work bazhang
2008-03-16T02:38:00.000Z	albyyx		and then i have the knotify from kde crash handler
2008-03-16T02:38:00.000Z	bazhang	albyyx	then you did not follow the instructions on the link I gave you correctly
2008-03-16T02:39:00.000Z	albyyx		let me see it again
2008-03-16T02:39:00.000Z	bazhang	albyyx	scroll up
2008-03-16T02:40:00.000Z	albyyx		i have it opened still no worries i was just seeing again the link, problem is that i dont remember if i used apt-get or aptitude.. but i should be able to see that in the console... hold on please...
2008-03-16T02:41:00.000Z	albyyx		hmmm bazhang  this is strange, i installed with sudo aptitude iinstall kubuntu-desktop and i removed it with sudo aptitude remove kubuntu-desktop as in the link, i tried once again and says no packages to remove but there must be some package (more than *some*) because the apps are there and i can see them from synaptic...
2008-03-16T02:42:00.000Z	bazhang	albyyx	you need to paste into the console the long list of packages on that link puregnome; just doing kubuntu-desktop is not enough
2008-03-16T02:42:00.000Z	albyyx		ah i see that's the step i missed thanks a lot bazhang  :))))
2008-03-16T02:44:00.000Z	albyyx	bazhang	 what's the adress for the pastebin?
2008-03-16T02:44:00.000Z	bazhang		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ albyyx
2008-03-16T02:44:00.000Z	albyyx		thanks :) i found out what was wrong... synaptic was opened :P
2008-03-16T02:45:00.000Z	albyyx		thanks bazhang  it's removing a lot of things ^_^
2008-03-16T02:45:00.000Z	bazhang	albyyx	no worries ;]
