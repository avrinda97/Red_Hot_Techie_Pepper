2011-04-03T00:37:00.000Z	Packrat_Mobile		AMD Phenom II X6 100T - Asus MS498TD EVO 3, 2 TB WD's, 1 60 GB OCZ SSD, Trying to run 2 of the WDs in a RAID 1 Mirrored Setup. Trying to run the other two in Seperate Spanned Arrays. I set /Home to mount on the RAID 1, install/partition goes fine through the Alternate Install CD, and when it comes time to Boot it says "The Drive for /Home is not available or ready yet."
2011-04-03T00:39:00.000Z	_Alex__		Is it a good idea to set up a RAID 1 (Mirroring) on 2 2Tb Drives?
