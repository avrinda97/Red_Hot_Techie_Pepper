2011-09-09T15:09:00.000Z	RedViper		This code allows me to shutdown my computer, how do I cancel it, in the terminal? sudo shutdown -h 13:00
2011-09-09T15:10:00.000Z	jrib	RedViper	tried searching « man shutdown » for "cancel"?  You can search man pages by typing: /cancel<enter>, then pressing 'n' and 'N' to go to next and previous hits
2011-09-09T15:22:00.000Z	jrib	RedViper	why do you keep repeating your question and ignoring replies?
2012-02-27T18:10:00.000Z	jrib	RedViper	10.04 is the latest LTS release
2012-02-27T18:10:00.000Z	jrib	RedViper	why do you want LTS though?
2012-02-27T18:11:00.000Z	RedViper	jrib	Because I am not to fond of settingup my system every 6 months
2012-02-27T18:12:00.000Z	jrib	RedViper	you can upgrade between releases; no need to setup again
2012-02-27T18:13:00.000Z	RedViper	jrib	I heard Upgrading was not as good as a new install. True?
2012-02-27T18:13:00.000Z	jrib	RedViper	I'd recommend you install 11.10 and then upgrade to 12.04 when it is released in april
2012-02-27T18:13:00.000Z	jrib	RedViper	good in what way?
2012-02-27T18:14:00.000Z	RedViper	jrib	As in it's different or more buggy
2012-02-27T18:14:00.000Z	jrib	RedViper	no, that's not true at all
2012-02-27T18:14:00.000Z	RedViper	jrib	Would you mind if I PM you or do you want me to stay here?
2012-02-27T18:15:00.000Z	jrib	RedViper	here is better
2012-02-27T18:16:00.000Z	RedViper	jrib	I am not a fan of unity, in fact I despise it. I use compiz to customise my desktop and Unity does not support it> your opinion?
2012-02-27T18:17:00.000Z	jrib	RedViper	you can install whatever window manager/desktop environment you want and select it at the login screen
2012-02-27T18:18:00.000Z	jrib	RedViper	I'd suggest something like xfce if you want a more traditional gnome-2ish environment
2012-02-27T18:19:00.000Z	RedViper	jrib	I am undecided now - 10.04 or 11.10?
2012-02-27T18:20:00.000Z	jrib	RedViper	why don't you try 11.10 and if it doesn't work out, you can always just install 10.04 over it.  Installs take like 15 minutes at most
2012-02-27T18:22:00.000Z	RedViper	jrib	The problem is I need to get my system up and running. I have 10.04 on CD and I need to download 11.10. I see your an Ubuntu fan through and through
2012-02-27T18:23:00.000Z	jrib	RedViper	ok install 10.04 then :)  See with 10.04 you'll need to upgrade to 12.04 before april of 2013.  With 11.10, you'll need to upgrade to 12.04 before april 2013 as well
