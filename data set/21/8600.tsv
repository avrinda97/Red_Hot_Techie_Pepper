2006-03-19T13:01:00.000Z	wuzzy		hi! today when i got home i can't boot my ubunu! it goes black after i choose ubuntu from the grub menu. then it loads the hd for a while and then stops. thats it. xp boots fine. can i enable some logging or something?
2006-03-19T13:01:00.000Z	chuckyp	wuzzy	you can select recovery mode singl user?
2006-03-19T13:02:00.000Z	chuckyp	wuzzy	then run the command to check the file system or flag it to be checked
2006-03-19T13:02:00.000Z	wuzzy	chuckyp	can i select that from grub?
2006-03-19T13:03:00.000Z	chuckyp	wuzzy	yes should be an option
2006-03-19T13:03:00.000Z	chuckyp	wuzzy	when you get to the grub menu right under the normal kernel there should be a recovery mode.
2006-03-19T13:03:00.000Z	wuzzy	chuckyp	ok i'll try.. how can i tell if it is a hd issue? i suspect one of my hds is failing on e.. it says missing interrups and so on i dmseg the last weeks..
2006-03-19T13:05:00.000Z	chuckyp	wuzzy	wuzzy you can fsck it.
2006-03-19T13:06:00.000Z	wuzzy	chuckyp	do you meen the recovery option in grub? that gives the same result..
2006-03-19T13:36:00.000Z	chuckyp	wuzzy	animation?
2006-03-19T13:37:00.000Z	chuckyp	wuzzy	the cursor wait?
2006-03-19T13:37:00.000Z	wuzzy	chuckyp	yeah, lines that kind of "scale" up" to the program windows.. ehh..
2006-03-19T13:37:00.000Z	chuckyp	wuzzy	don't knwo what you are talking about?  are you running xgl?
2006-03-19T13:38:00.000Z	wuzzy	chuckyp	yeah, but this is not part of compiz.. it feels "old", just like lines that give the illusion of thefirefox  winow coming from the panel
2006-03-19T13:39:00.000Z	chuckyp	wuzzy	The effect you are talking about is an xgl thing.  Its like the menu is out of focus for a second is what you mean?
2006-03-19T13:41:00.000Z	wuzzy	chuckyp	this is difficult to explain.. no its not like that.. it draws, first i small rectangle with blue lines, then it draws a bigger rectangle, and then a bigger one, do you follow?
2006-03-19T13:41:00.000Z	chuckyp	wuzzy	yes but I don' thave that problem
2006-03-19T13:42:00.000Z	wuzzy	chuckyp	strange, i haven't changed anything.. and xgl work perfect for me.. this dow not feel like xgl
2006-03-19T13:43:00.000Z	wuzzy	chuckyp	 its just simple, blue 1pixel rectangles..
2006-03-19T13:43:00.000Z	chuckyp	wuzzy	don't have that on my screen.
2006-03-19T13:43:00.000Z	wuzzy	chuckyp	ok, thanks anyway!
