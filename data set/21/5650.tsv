2007-09-05T14:43:00.000Z	yokomo		how do I tell if I have OpenGL direct rendering set up right? I have a ATI X1300 card, envy installed
2007-09-05T14:45:00.000Z	yjwong	yokomo	in a normal X server, type "fglrxinfo" (without the quotes) in the Terminal
2007-09-05T14:46:00.000Z	yokomo	yjwong	all that tells me is that I have OpenGL version string 2.0.6458 (8.36.5)
2007-09-05T14:46:00.000Z	yjwong		um, sorry, i said the wrong command
2007-09-05T14:46:00.000Z	yjwong		it is "glxinfo | grep rendering"
2007-09-05T14:47:00.000Z	yjwong		if everything is well and working, it should say: direct rendering: Yes
2007-09-05T14:47:00.000Z	yokomo		hrm
2007-09-05T14:47:00.000Z	yokomo		says "No"
2007-09-05T14:47:00.000Z	yokomo		for direct rendering
2007-09-05T14:47:00.000Z	yjwong		did you disable Composite in xorg.conf?
2007-09-05T14:48:00.000Z	yokomo		Xlib: extension "Xfree86-DRI" missing on display ";1.0"
2007-09-05T14:48:00.000Z	yokomo	yjwong	I don't believe I did
2007-09-05T14:48:00.000Z	yjwong		uh, you are running glxinfo under Xgl, yes?
2007-09-05T14:48:00.000Z	yokomo		I think so
2007-09-05T14:48:00.000Z	yokomo		I installed compiz
2007-09-05T14:49:00.000Z	yjwong	yokomo	if compiz would work then everything is well
2007-09-05T14:49:00.000Z	yokomo		weird that it would not come up then
2007-09-05T14:49:00.000Z	yjwong		under Xgl direct rendering would always be "no"
2007-09-05T14:49:00.000Z	yokomo		oh
2007-09-05T14:50:00.000Z	yokomo		so, if I want to run games with cedega do I have to turn it on?
2007-09-05T14:50:00.000Z	yjwong	yokomo	not neccessarily
