2012-11-22T12:39:00.000Z	Gnomex	nowayride	What ur mean..?
2012-11-22T12:40:00.000Z	nowayride	Gnomex	any half decent hosing company would put DoS protection up quick, that script's been out a while
2012-11-22T12:41:00.000Z	Gnomex		Owwh.. that means that script out of date for a now.?? Hmmm..
2012-11-22T12:41:00.000Z	nowayride	Gnomex	not that it's out of date, but that technique has been out for a few years and most DDoS mitigation tools have had time to update it. Think of it like trying to use an old trojan on a computer with an updated antivirus
2012-11-22T12:42:00.000Z	Gnomex		Hmm.. Oowwh.. i see tat.. Thanks for tat info Nowayride..

2012-11-22T12:43:00.000Z	nowayride	Gnomex	Likely you'll shut down the server until either the admin catches on or if they have HTTP monitoring when it pops up, then they put something like Guard in place and you might get some legitimate traffic blocked
