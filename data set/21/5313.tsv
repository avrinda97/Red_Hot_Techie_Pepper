2007-11-26T13:05:00.000Z	lemons		uh. So. Yeah. My laptop has been overheating (100C) a lot ever since I got ubuntu.
2007-11-26T13:06:00.000Z	lemons		Only since I got ubuntu in fact. It's never overheated before.
2007-11-26T13:06:00.000Z	lemons		Yeah
2007-11-26T13:06:00.000Z	lemons		._. It's not overheating right at this moment
2007-11-26T13:08:00.000Z	lemons		Uh. It doesn't just start overheating as soon as it is on. Usually after a few hours of use it will start in the 80s or 90s
2007-11-26T13:08:00.000Z	lemons		Oh, but youtube videos for some reason make it heat up REALLY fast
2007-11-26T13:08:00.000Z	lemons		Yeah, I realize this.
2007-11-26T13:08:00.000Z	lemons		But 100C is insane
2007-11-26T13:09:00.000Z	lemons		Yeah, it's at 62C. right now.
2007-11-26T13:09:00.000Z	lemons		But I've been told that's normal for AMD or whatever.
2007-11-26T13:09:00.000Z	mavi-	lemons	what kind of laptop is it?
2007-11-26T13:10:00.000Z	mavi-	lemons	get a fan plate if you are using it mostly at home, and turn off compiz when you arent
2007-11-26T13:12:00.000Z	mavi-	lemons	clean out your fans as step one
2007-11-26T13:13:00.000Z	mavi-	lemons	compiz are ubuntus 3d effects desktop
2007-11-26T13:14:00.000Z	mavi-	lemons	you can right click the panel and add the CPU speed meter
2007-11-26T13:14:00.000Z	mavi-	lemons	then you see if your CPU drops down to lower mhz when it isnt in use
2007-11-26T13:14:00.000Z	mavi-	lemons	if it doesnt then your speed step isnt working, that would make some extra heat to
2007-11-26T13:16:00.000Z	mavi-	lemons	then search for CPU and you find it
2007-11-26T13:18:00.000Z	mavi-	lemons	if it doesnt, we have found a possible heat source =)
2007-11-26T13:19:00.000Z	mavi-	lemons	is it a 800mhz laptop?
2007-11-26T13:20:00.000Z	mavi-	lemons	listen to your fans, are they running?
