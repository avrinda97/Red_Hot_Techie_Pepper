2004-10-15T07:26:00.000Z	digerati_		I'm thinking about beginning to use ubuntu. I have a few questions though.
2004-10-15T07:26:00.000Z	digerati_		I'm assuming it uses apt-get as a package manager?
2004-10-15T07:27:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	digerati_	synaptic is the default gui frontend, accessible from the menus
2004-10-15T07:28:00.000Z	digerati_	jgeorgeson	- I see. Are the packages it gets compiled from source, or are they binary?
2004-10-15T07:28:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	digerati_	not sure i understand what you're asking, do you mean like gentoo is installed from source?
2004-10-15T07:29:00.000Z	digerati_	jgeorgeson	Aye.
2004-10-15T07:29:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	digerati_	no
2004-10-15T07:29:00.000Z	digerati_	jgeorgeson	- Could you possibly name some of the differences I might encounter between gentoo and ubuntu?
2004-10-15T07:30:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	digerati_	never used gentoo. ubuntu is based on debian, only it is much nicer
2004-10-15T07:30:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	digerati_	by nicer, i mean there is much less maunal configuration to do
2004-10-15T07:30:00.000Z	digerati_	jgeorgeson	I have only seen Ubuntu with Gnome as the WM. Is it possible to use *box?
2004-10-15T07:32:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	digerati_	probably, I see fluxbox listed
2004-10-15T07:32:00.000Z	digerati_	jgeorgeson	- D'you know how easy it would be to get my dlink card working?
2004-10-15T07:33:00.000Z	digerati_	jgeorgeson	- Would I still have to build the acx100 drivers (or is there native support)?
2004-10-15T07:34:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	digerati_	no idea. you could check on #debian-boot to see if the installer supports that NIC
2004-10-15T07:34:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	digerati_	if the installer does, than the installed system will to. if not, the installed system still might
2004-10-15T07:37:00.000Z	digerati_	jgeorgeson	- what version of Xorg does Ubuntu use?
2004-10-15T07:37:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	digerati_	it uses xfree86 for no, next release should be changing to xorg
2004-10-15T07:37:00.000Z	digerati_	jgeorgeson	- Ah.
2004-10-15T07:41:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	digerati_	you can access them as a network share, or mounted vfat or ntfs if it is a local drive
2004-10-15T07:42:00.000Z	digerati_	jgeorgeson	It is a local drive :) A local drive that will be formatted.
