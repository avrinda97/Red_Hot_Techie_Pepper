2011-08-18T14:23:00.000Z	makara	mssever	they are two unrelated questions
2011-08-18T14:19:00.000Z	mssever	makara	I didn't catch the beginning of your problem, but if it's too difficult to get a solution here, try askubuntu..com
2011-08-18T14:22:00.000Z	makara	mssever	thanks I'll try them. Let me repeat here once more if you could take a look please
2011-08-18T14:23:00.000Z	mssever	makara	How does this affect wifi? Or am I confusing you sith someone else?
2011-08-18T14:25:00.000Z	mssever	makara	I don't know much about X issues, but I suspect that a wrong driver is being loaded somehow
2011-08-18T14:28:00.000Z	makara	mssever	the driver should be fine because I can switch the resolution, but the config file is not saving properly
2011-08-18T14:28:00.000Z	makara	mssever	maybe about the wifi question then
2011-08-18T14:28:00.000Z	mssever	makara	Have you tried backing up and deleting Xorg.conf?
2011-08-18T14:29:00.000Z	mssever	makara	These days, many configurations don't require an Xorg.conf
2011-08-18T14:29:00.000Z	mssever	makara	Can you repeat your wifi question?
2011-08-18T14:35:00.000Z	makara	mssever	i have pc with a d-link wifi device. it can detect wifis in the area, but stalls on authentication. i get the same log output as this bug report https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/753174
2011-08-18T14:36:00.000Z	makara	mssever	I installed the natty-proposed kernel updates ...38-11 and still it gives the same error
2011-08-18T14:38:00.000Z	mssever	makara	I don't have a browser open at the moment to look at the bug, but I don't have any special knowledge of working around kernel bugs. Sorry
2011-08-18T14:38:00.000Z	makara	mssever	I've heard about other problem with WAP, but when I use WEP or no authentication it still gives issues. i think its a broader issue than just the wifi because my GSM modem also gives trouble, as double the ethernet after every 3rd boot or so
2011-08-18T14:39:00.000Z	mssever	makara	I'm sorry. I don't really know anything about those kinds of problems. My wireless works perfectly, so I've never had to troubleshoot it.
2011-08-18T14:40:00.000Z	makara	mssever	are you just a friendly, or do you work for Canonical?
2011-08-18T14:40:00.000Z	mssever	makara	I don't work for Canonical, and neither do most people here
2011-08-18T14:40:00.000Z	mssever	makara	This is just a community support channel
2011-08-18T14:40:00.000Z	mssever	makara	nothing official
2011-08-18T14:41:00.000Z	mssever	makara	No. To get official support, you have to purchase a support contract from Canonical
2011-08-18T14:43:00.000Z	mssever	makara	I just like helping. As do most other people
