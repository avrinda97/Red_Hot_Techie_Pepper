2006-07-15T08:36:00.000Z	knownot	hastesaver	no
2006-07-15T08:37:00.000Z	knownot	hastesaver	what do you mean destroyed?
2006-07-15T08:39:00.000Z	hastesaver	knownot	can you help?
2006-07-15T08:41:00.000Z	knownot	hastesaver	know why my box wont work with smp
2006-07-15T08:41:00.000Z	hastesaver	knownot	sorry, I'm too poor for this barter system to work :(
2006-07-15T08:42:00.000Z	knownot	hastesaver	lol
2006-07-15T08:42:00.000Z	hastesaver	knownot	but do you have an idea what will happen now? I'm afraid of rebooting...
2006-07-15T08:43:00.000Z	knownot	hastesaver	what is mounted under /mnt usually?
2006-07-15T08:43:00.000Z	knownot	hastesaver	 nothing of importance to system booting usually
2006-07-15T08:45:00.000Z	hastesaver	knownot	nothing in my /etc/fstab, and nothing listed by "mount". Does this mean it's safe??
2006-07-15T08:45:00.000Z	knownot	hastesaver	most probably
2006-07-15T08:46:00.000Z	knownot	hastesaver	nothing
2006-07-15T08:46:00.000Z	knownot	hastesaver	ubuntu seems to use /media for most stuff
2006-07-15T08:47:00.000Z	hastesaver	knownot	yes, thankfully. Nothing at all in your /mnt? That's a relief :)
2006-07-15T08:57:00.000Z	hastesaver	knownot	It's worse than that. I can't remove it, or move it, or anything. "cannot lstat `mnt': Input/output error". Do you know what to do now? :)
2006-07-15T08:58:00.000Z	knownot	hastesaver	it is a IDE drive, not SATA/scsi?
2006-07-15T09:03:00.000Z	hastesaver	knownot	I fixed my system, and all it took was a "umount /mnt". Thanks for the hints, and sorry I can't help you with smp :)
2006-07-15T09:03:00.000Z	knownot	hastesaver	np
2006-07-15T09:14:00.000Z	knownot	hastesaver	so you can spend countless hours configuring KDE to you likeing, I switched back to gnome :P
