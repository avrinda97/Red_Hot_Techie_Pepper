2007-09-19T07:05:00.000Z	Draggin		I am brand spanking new to Ubuntu (and linux in general, for that matter) and I need some help... I'm struggling with the installation... Anyone willing to give me advice?
2007-09-19T07:05:00.000Z	marcus	Draggin	what's up?
2007-09-19T07:07:00.000Z	marcus	Draggin	what kind of computer are you on?
2007-09-19T07:08:00.000Z	marcus	Draggin	what was it getting stuck on?
2007-09-19T07:11:00.000Z	marcus	Draggin	sorry, i've got nothing for that one
2007-09-19T07:11:00.000Z	marcus	Draggin	have you tried installing in a different mode?
2007-09-19T07:11:00.000Z	marcus	Draggin	perhaps safe graphics mode?
2007-09-19T07:12:00.000Z	marcus	Draggin	There's an option on the install menu
2007-09-19T07:13:00.000Z	marcus	Draggin	I'm not sure of the exact name, but when you boot the install CD it's the second option, i believe
2007-09-19T07:13:00.000Z	marcus	Draggin	What version of windows is it?
2007-09-19T07:14:00.000Z	marcus	Draggin	http://www.matthewjmiller.net/howtos/dual-boot-linux-and-windows/

2007-09-19T07:24:00.000Z	marcus	Draggin	what's up?
2007-09-19T07:24:00.000Z	marcus	Draggin	Oh?  what's the problem?
2007-09-19T07:25:00.000Z	marcus	Draggin	well, it's possible, yes
2007-09-19T07:26:00.000Z	marcus	Draggin	Linux rescue CD?  wtf?
2007-09-19T07:29:00.000Z	marcus	Draggin	if you mess something up, there's a good chance you can fix it from the ubuntu livecd
