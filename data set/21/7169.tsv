2008-04-01T03:35:00.000Z	Slart	mrkeishii	you're trying to update to 2.4.0, right?
2008-04-01T03:36:00.000Z	Slart	mrkeishii	irc is a much nicer place if you think a second before you type.. try writing all you want to say on one line.. and start the line with the nick of the person you're talking to

2008-04-15T00:34:00.000Z	Slart	mrkeishii	same thing as envy? then don't.. try !envy
2008-04-15T00:34:00.000Z	Slart	mrkeishii	you do not need it.. we do not support it
2008-04-15T00:35:00.000Z	Slart	mrkeishii	you install wine.. and a graphics driver with 3d acceleration
2008-04-15T00:35:00.000Z	Slart	mrkeishii	wine is installed using synaptic.. drivers can be installed using restricted drivers manager
2008-04-15T00:36:00.000Z	Slart	mrkeishii	it's on the ubuntu site.. but it's kind of out-of-the-way.. do you want the torrent?
