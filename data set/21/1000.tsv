2011-03-08T21:36:00.000Z	MisterTickles		Hey guys, I installed UNR 10.10 on my netbook but I can't figure out how to connect to the internet through my wireless router. I've been trying since yesterday but the OS just won't show me the wireless networks. It's becoming urgent I get connected and would appreciate some help.
2011-03-08T21:38:00.000Z	MisterTickles		Can anyone at all help me out?

2011-03-08T21:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MisterTickles	 does the 'addational drivers' tool suggest any other drivers for your wireless?
2011-03-08T21:40:00.000Z	MisterTickles	Dr_Willis	I'll try to find that additional drivers thing. I'm entirely new to Linux.
2011-03-08T21:41:00.000Z	MisterTickles	Dr_Willis	When I click on the little ubuntu icon on the top left then search for additional drivers, I see two tools. One which's icon is a chip and a lock in front of it, the other which is a box with a ruler and other stuff in it.
2011-03-08T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MisterTickles	 i dont use the netbook edition. so not sure what you are refering to.
2011-03-08T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MisterTickles	 open terminal and run 'gksudo jockey-gtk' perhaps. :)
2011-03-08T21:43:00.000Z	MisterTickles	Dr_Willis	I did that, it prompted me for my pass which I put in and I got: Downloading package indexes failed, please check your network status. Most drivers will not be available.
2011-03-08T21:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MisterTickles	 i would connect a wired cable.. and let it check again. yoru wireless card may need addational drivers.
2011-03-08T21:44:00.000Z	MisterTickles	Dr_Willis	Is it okay if I stay here to inform you of progress?
2011-03-08T21:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MisterTickles	 as long as you are going to run a cable.. do a update/upgrade also.
2011-03-08T21:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MisterTickles	 Ive not had to mess with wireless in ages.. so  You got most all tehinfo ui ahve on the topic. :) otheres in here may be able to help with other issues that come up.
2011-03-08T21:46:00.000Z	MisterTickles	Dr_Willis	I plugged in an ethernet cable. I'm now connected to the internet.
2011-03-08T21:46:00.000Z	MisterTickles	Dr_Willis	Do I try gksudo jockey-gtk again?
2011-03-08T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MisterTickles	 yes.
2011-03-08T21:48:00.000Z	MisterTickles	Dr_Willis	I did, it did some updating or something. Now it popped up an issue about there being no proprietary drivers in use on this system with "Broadcom STA wireless driver">
2011-03-08T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MisterTickles	 if you are lucky thats all you needed.
2011-03-08T21:49:00.000Z	MisterTickles	Dr_Willis	What would have been the manual equivalent to typing gksudo jockey-gtk in terminal?
2011-03-08T21:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MisterTickles	 system -> admin -> addational drivers.
2011-03-08T21:52:00.000Z	MisterTickles	Dr_Willis	That fixed it!! Thank you so much!
