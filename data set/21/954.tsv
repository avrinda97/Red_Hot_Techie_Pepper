2012-02-17T00:20:00.000Z	[snake]		hello, I just installed a game(Halo CE) and when I open it in wine the resolution is too high, how can I fix this? I can't see anything, my monitors limit is 1366x768@60hz
2012-02-17T00:21:00.000Z	cypher-neo	[snake]	Open "Configure Wine" and change the monitor resolution
2012-02-17T00:22:00.000Z	cypher-neo	[snake]	It would be under "Graphics". You can limit the size of the virtual desktop
2012-02-17T00:23:00.000Z	[snake]	cypher-neo	It didn't work I think the virtual desktop is for icons... instead of placing them(shortcuts) on your gnome desktop.
2012-02-17T00:24:00.000Z	cypher-neo	[snake]	I know it works that way, becuase I've used it to limit the desktop size of several other applications of mine.
2012-02-17T00:24:00.000Z	cypher-neo	[snake]	And, no, virtual desktop has nothing to do with icons.
2012-02-17T00:25:00.000Z	[snake]	cypher-neo	oh- okay, well I tried a few different that I knew should work and they didn't because the application is not following the rules then.
2012-02-17T00:25:00.000Z	cypher-neo	[snake]	You have to restart the application to make the rules stick.
2012-02-17T00:26:00.000Z	[snake]	cypher-neo	I did
2012-02-17T00:26:00.000Z	cypher-neo	[snake]	You restarted Halo CE?
2012-02-17T00:27:00.000Z	[snake]	cypher-neo	yeah.
2012-02-17T00:28:00.000Z	[snake]	cypher-neo	notepad isn't constricted to my smaller virtual desktop either...
2012-02-17T00:28:00.000Z	[snake]	cypher-neo	it works on all areas of my desktop
2012-02-17T00:29:00.000Z	cypher-neo	[snake]	But the window size of the Wine program should be fixed.
2012-02-17T00:29:00.000Z	cypher-neo	[snake]	And once it's fixed to a certain size it also is smaller.
2012-02-17T00:29:00.000Z	[snake]	cypher-neo	for notepad yes. for halo no.
2012-02-17T00:30:00.000Z	cypher-neo	[snake]	Is there an option within Halo itself to run in a window?
2012-02-17T00:31:00.000Z	cypher-neo	[snake]	If you can set Halo to run windowized it should abide by the Wine config
2012-02-17T00:31:00.000Z	[snake]	cypher-neo	there might be, and there is a place to change screen resolution for when it starts too... only one problem I can't see where to click to get to it.
2012-02-17T00:32:00.000Z	[snake]	cypher-neo	hey... it worked AUTOMAGICALLY
2012-02-17T00:33:00.000Z	[snake]	cypher-neo	I think it's because I turned the desktop back off... which is weird because it didn't work like that initially. thanks though!
