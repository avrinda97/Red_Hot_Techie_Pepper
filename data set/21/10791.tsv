2004-11-09T06:25:00.000Z	Delgul	Treenaks	So how do they pay for the developers they hired?
2004-11-09T06:21:00.000Z	Treenaks	Delgul	what do you want to know...
2004-11-09T06:22:00.000Z	Delgul	Treenaks	Ok, I am confused about the package management. Will I have my apt-get update/upgrade and can I upgrade into eternity?
2004-11-09T06:23:00.000Z	Delgul	Treenaks	Cool... freedom of choice in KDE/Gnome?
2004-11-09T06:23:00.000Z	Delgul	Treenaks	Kernel 2.6 or 2.4?
2004-11-09T06:23:00.000Z	Treenaks	Delgul	2.6
2004-11-09T06:23:00.000Z	Delgul	Treenaks	ALSA or OSS audio?
2004-11-09T06:23:00.000Z	Treenaks	Delgul	freedom of choice, basically.. but KDE is not supported (you can install it, not guarantees)
2004-11-09T06:23:00.000Z	Treenaks	Delgul	ALSA, OSS emu
2004-11-09T06:24:00.000Z	Delgul	Treenaks	Cool... where's the catch then? Can I install it comercially for my customers without starting to pay?
2004-11-09T06:25:00.000Z	Treenaks	Delgul	it's Free.. just like Debian is
2004-11-09T06:26:00.000Z	Treenaks	Delgul	uhhh.. isn't that in the FAQ?

2004-11-09T06:26:00.000Z	Delgul	Treenaks	You are right, perhaps I should read that one too ;-) What is your general impression Treenaks?
2004-11-09T06:27:00.000Z	Treenaks	Delgul	I love it :)
2004-11-09T06:27:00.000Z	Treenaks	Delgul	I've become an instant Ubuntu salesman ;)
2004-11-09T06:27:00.000Z	Delgul	Treenaks	Any points you don love that you want to share?
