2007-06-06T09:17:00.000Z	steel_lady		please, I need help with an installation
2007-06-06T09:17:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	What do you need?
2007-06-06T09:18:00.000Z	steel_lady	PurpZeY	I am trying to install IDL oficial trial package following instructions but it does not work
2007-06-06T09:19:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	Link to instructions?
2007-06-06T09:20:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	what step are you up to?
2007-06-06T09:21:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	You are trying to set the "predefined options" ?
2007-06-06T09:21:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	did you set the predefined options using sudo/
2007-06-06T09:23:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	The first step there... ITT-DIR/idl64/bin/idl_setup.bash
2007-06-06T09:23:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	I am guessing that ITT-DIR is /usr/bin/ITT (or something similar, but I have no way of knowing.
2007-06-06T09:24:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	That is probably necessary.
2007-06-06T09:25:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	Ok.
2007-06-06T09:27:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	You ran it with sudo, right?
2007-06-06T09:27:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	yeah, that's good then.
2007-06-06T09:28:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	ok. what is it?
2007-06-06T09:30:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	It is possible, I mean, why not keep walking through the install.
2007-06-06T09:31:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	So then, you are set?
2007-06-06T09:35:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	No problem.
2007-06-06T10:31:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	It's not all that difficult...their software isn't free, so if you want to use it, you should pay for it.
2007-06-06T10:32:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	I need a ride to work tomorrow, since my car is in the shop, should I just steal my roommates car just for tomorrow?
2007-06-06T10:32:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	Call them and get the eval liscense by phone.
2007-06-06T10:33:00.000Z	PurpZeY	steel_lady	He *might* but he'd give it to me, I wouldn't take his keys.
