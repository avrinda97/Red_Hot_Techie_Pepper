2006-05-22T10:53:00.000Z	GaiaX11		I've asked the reason why they gave the names: Hoary; Breeze; Warty - to Ubuntu but it has been difficult to get an answer. Anyone here knows?
2006-05-22T10:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	GaiaX11	 the big guy has a funny sence of Humor.
2006-05-22T10:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	GaiaX11	 they are just names that match the animal names.
2006-05-22T10:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	GaiaX11	 they all had animal names - you aparently just read the first half of the names. check ubuntu homepage for details :P
2006-05-25T11:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	GaiaX11	 could be the audio is in a codec it cant handle
2006-05-25T11:38:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Dr_Willis	how can i discover?
2006-05-25T11:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	GaiaX11	 run the player from the shell and see if any error messages are shown. also try othe rplayers. and check into the 'verbose' message options of the players.
2006-05-25T11:39:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Dr_Willis	 I have so many codecs installed but there is one: something like gst-register that i need. I think!
2006-05-25T11:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	GaiaX11	 dont sound familer.. try vlc, or some other players.
2006-05-25T11:41:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Dr_Willis	this is the message:  totem dvl-animatrix.avi
2006-05-25T11:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	GaiaX11	 i would say.. dont use totem. try vlc
2006-06-14T09:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	GaiaX11	 a small fan  - may be for the north bridge. you can get large heatsink replacements for the fan for like $5
2006-06-14T09:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	GaiaX11	 or get a new better fan for it for about $14
2006-06-14T09:18:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Dr_Willis	Do you think that if i use the machine without it anything could go wrong?
2006-06-14T09:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	GaiaX11	 it may crash if ya play games.. or may over heat and crash
2006-06-14T09:30:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Dr_Willis	do i have to get the same model of asus motherboard northbridge heatsink to replace the other or it does not matter?
2006-06-14T09:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	GaiaX11	  i doubt it it matters. check out that xoxide.com (i think) site that sells parts.
2006-06-14T09:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	GaiaX11	 i got a large heatsink to replace the fan on my main pc.. then opened it up and realized it allready had one. :P
