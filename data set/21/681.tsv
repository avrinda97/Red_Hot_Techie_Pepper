2011-08-06T14:48:00.000Z	karni		Hi guys. I'm having issues booting 10.04.3 from USB key. It tells me "Unknown keyword in configuration file: gfxboot"
2011-08-06T14:49:00.000Z	karni		I've booted it from USB key.
2011-08-06T14:49:00.000Z	karni		I have also tried re-burning the iso onto the USB, still same issue.
2011-08-06T14:49:00.000Z	karni		I also can't find other 10.04 version than 10.04.3
2011-08-06T14:49:00.000Z	karni		Any hints how can I boot the 10.04.3 installer?
2011-08-06T14:50:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	karni	try unetbootin
2011-08-06T14:53:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	karni	Try using unetbootin
2011-08-06T14:53:00.000Z	karni	GirlyGirl	I'll try that (does it run on Ubuntu?)

2011-08-06T14:57:00.000Z	karni	GirlyGirl	How do you know? I thought iso is just an iso :<
2011-08-06T14:57:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	karni	You're welcome
2011-08-06T15:11:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	karni	Glad it worked out karni!

2011-08-06T15:12:00.000Z	karni	GirlyGirl	No! Can't be! Seriously ;)! <3
2011-08-06T15:13:00.000Z	karni	GirlyGirl	'guys' term is a unisex thing :)
2011-08-06T15:14:00.000Z	karni	GirlyGirl	You really think he meant that? #ubuntuone is much more heavy than this channel at this time of day :) I don't think it's a problem.
2011-08-06T15:14:00.000Z	karni	GirlyGirl	But I'm happy to hear about ubuntu-offtopic
