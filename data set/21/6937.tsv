2010-05-27T21:51:00.000Z	Innomen		hey all, how can I use disk utility run from a live cd to set the primary boot parition from one drive to another?
2010-05-27T21:53:00.000Z	kwtm	Innomen	Primary boot partition ... you mean you select which partition you would boot from, by default?
2010-05-27T21:53:00.000Z	Innomen	kwtm	yes
2010-05-27T21:54:00.000Z	kwtm	Innomen	I think this is what you are asking: you have installed Ubuntu 10.04 but are set up for dual booting so you can choose to boot something else (Windows?  Ubuntu 9.10?)  You can always choose which partition to boot into (not boot "from") but you want to change the default so you don't have to select it each time.  Yes?
2010-05-27T21:55:00.000Z	Innomen	kwtm	negative, I am using an Ubuntu live cd to manage a windows machine, I can find no documentation for "disk utility" via Google, I want to for the machine to boot from a given parition (which it sees) I just don't know how to convey my wish to disk utility
2010-05-27T21:57:00.000Z	kwtm	Innomen	I guess what I'm asking is, what (if any) is allowing you to boot from various partitions in the Windows machine (without using any live CD)?  If nothing, then you have to install GRUB (or SmartBoot or some other such program).  You can also "install" it on a CD so you don't touch the hard drive, but you would need to insert the CD each time.
2010-05-27T21:58:00.000Z	kwtm	Innomen	If there is already a program such as GRUB, you would need instructions for that specific program.  If it's Grub, people here are probably familiar with it.
2010-05-27T21:59:00.000Z	Innomen	kwtm	it currently boots from the windows, I don't need it to multiboot, I just need it to boot from a different drive, is diskutility unable to change which drive has priority?
2010-05-27T21:59:00.000Z	Innomen	kwtm	once it boots from the hp parition its going to wipe the rest of the machine anyway
2010-05-27T21:59:00.000Z	kwtm	Innomen	When you say "disk utility" you seem to be referring to a specific disk utility, but I'm not familiar with this.  Does it come with Ubuntu?  (I use Kubuntu myself.)
2010-05-27T22:00:00.000Z	kwtm	Innomen	Oh, I think I see what you mean.  The partition table can set one of the primary partitions (but not a secondary partition) with a boot flag.  I think you can do that from fdisk.
2010-05-27T22:00:00.000Z	Innomen	kwtm	yeah that's all its called in Ubuntu 10, "disk utility" (which makes googleing for information about it a DREAM let me tell you)
2010-05-27T22:01:00.000Z	kwtm	Innomen	fdisk is the basic text-based program; a more sophisticated one is "parted", and there are several GUI's for it, like "gparted" or "qtparted".
2010-05-27T22:01:00.000Z	kwtm	Innomen	You'd think QtPartEd is just the KDE (Qt) version of GPartEd, but I've used both and GPartEd has more features.
2010-05-27T22:02:00.000Z	Innomen	kwtm	NightlyUser, what operation must I perform with either app? How can I launch gparted?
2010-05-27T22:02:00.000Z	kwtm	Innomen	Yeah, I notice that Ubuntu has these touchy-feely names like "A Web Browser", which makes things frustrating.
2010-05-27T22:02:00.000Z	kwtm	Innomen	You can type "gparted" from the command line (boot up Ubuntu live, then go to Terminal).
2010-05-27T22:02:00.000Z	Innomen	kwtm	excellent thank you
2010-05-27T22:03:00.000Z	kwtm	Innomen	Wait...
2010-05-27T22:03:00.000Z	kwtm	Innomen	Just tried it on my Kubuntu system and there is no such command... you might have to try "sudo gparted"...I will try now.
2010-05-27T22:04:00.000Z	kwtm	Innomen	Okay, you'd have to "sudo apt-get install gparted" first, but I think it will then install from Live CD and you don't need an internet connection for that.
