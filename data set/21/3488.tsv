2008-12-15T06:20:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid		i installed amule on my linux and it used to run fine. but now when i wanna start it in applications- internet-amule, i get the error that the permissions on the configuration directory are too strict. but i didn't chnage them, and b4 it worked. what went wrong?
2008-12-15T06:20:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid		and what permissions should i give to the directory /usr/local/bin?
2008-12-15T06:21:00.000Z	raylu	AndreasMadrid	you shouldn't touch those permissions, and that's not the configuration directory
2008-12-15T06:21:00.000Z	raylu	AndreasMadrid	global configurations are usually in /etc, but it's likely talking about local permissions in your home directory. try "ls -A ~"
2008-12-15T06:21:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid	raylu	not?
2008-12-15T06:22:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid	raylu	I'm new to linux: ls -A ~ where in a special directory?
2008-12-15T06:22:00.000Z	raylu	AndreasMadrid	~ = /home/$USER
2008-12-15T06:22:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid	raylu	ah
2008-12-15T06:23:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid	raylu	ok, this listed files and directories. and now?
2008-12-15T06:24:00.000Z	raylu	AndreasMadrid	now, find the configuration directory it's talking about
2008-12-15T06:25:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid	raylu	it spoke of /usr/local/bin   in ~ I only have .local/share
2008-12-15T06:27:00.000Z	raylu	AndreasMadrid	hrm. i'm not sure then. it'd be helpful if they told you which directory they were talking about
2008-12-15T06:28:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid	raylu	i just gave the user i am, the right to cretate and delete files in /usr/local/bin, and now the program is happy
2008-12-15T06:29:00.000Z	raylu	AndreasMadrid	um
2008-12-15T06:29:00.000Z	raylu	AndreasMadrid	now your system is unhappy
2008-12-15T06:29:00.000Z	raylu	AndreasMadrid	you shouldn't edit files in /usr/local/bin
2008-12-15T06:30:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid	raylu	oh
2008-12-15T06:30:00.000Z	raylu	AndreasMadrid	what app is this? i think you should copy the binary file to your home dir and run it from somewhere in tere
2008-12-15T06:32:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid	raylu	maybe i installed it in the wrong directory, that may be the cuase. I will try to reinstall it. Thank you.
2008-12-15T06:34:00.000Z	raylu	AndreasMadrid	and you should change those permissions for /usr/local/bin asap
2008-12-15T06:35:00.000Z	AndreasMadrid	raylu	yes, changes already undone. Thank you
