2011-10-16T02:11:00.000Z	MyNickIsLongerTh		Another question: When I enter the virtual desktop, I'm presented with 4 desktops.  If I click one, it shows that one at about 90% scale, and I have to click on it again to enter it.  Why is it doing this, and is there a way to make it just switch to the correct desktop?
2011-10-16T02:11:00.000Z	yagoo	MyNickIsLongerTh	they're called workspaces.. try not to say "virtual" desktop.. it can be very misleading
2011-10-16T02:12:00.000Z	MyNickIsLongerTh		yahoo: ?  The name virtual desktop dates back to the Sun window manager.  What makes it confusing?
2011-10-16T02:13:00.000Z	yagoo	MyNickIsLongerTh	vmware /virtual box..
2011-10-16T02:13:00.000Z	yagoo	MyNickIsLongerTh	virtualization is the big thing these days..
2011-10-16T02:14:00.000Z	MyNickIsLongerTh		yahoo: ok, so is there a way to get more than 4 workspaces, spaces, or desktops (whatever you wish to call them), and to get ubuntu to jump into the workspace  I click on instead of showing me that weird preview?
2011-10-16T02:15:00.000Z	yagoo	MyNickIsLongerTh	don't say I'm calling them this. This is what gnome and kde call them.. Workspaces.. I'm not making up the vocabulary .. so don't argue with me onthis thanks..
2011-10-16T02:16:00.000Z	MyNickIsLongerTh	yagoo	whatever you wish to call them is fine.  I'm not asking about vocabulary.  I'm asking about how to alter their behavior.
2011-10-16T02:17:00.000Z	yagoo	MyNickIsLongerTh	Gnome desktop is Ubuntu's default desktop.  If you say virtual desktop.. fine.. just don't tell others to follow your own vocabulary because i'm not.
2011-10-16T02:17:00.000Z	yagoo	MyNickIsLongerTh	you're still very new to linux I see.. So learn from the others. Thanks.
2011-10-16T02:17:00.000Z	MyNickIsLongerTh		yahoo: I've been running Linux since 1994.
2011-10-16T02:17:00.000Z	MyNickIsLongerTh		yahoo, that is
2011-10-16T02:19:00.000Z	MyNickIsLongerTh		ok, so let me try the question again.  Is there a way to get Ubuntu to switch directly to the desktop, workspace, space, or whatever you wish to call it in the workspace manager, rather than showing a 90% preview first?
2011-10-16T02:20:00.000Z	yagoo	MyNickIsLongerTh	you're new to Linux. I doubt u use linux since 1994.
2011-10-16T02:20:00.000Z	yagoo		lol
2011-10-16T02:21:00.000Z	yagoo	MyNickIsLongerTh	i have unix guys 20 years in the unix business saying they know everything.. and get pissed off at the linux learning curve.. saying how linux should be like unix.. so i pretty much know where u come from..
2011-10-16T02:21:00.000Z	MyNickIsLongerTh		yahoo: umm.  OK.  That's your choice.
2011-10-16T02:21:00.000Z	MyNickIsLongerTh	yagoo	Ummm...OK.
2011-10-16T02:22:00.000Z	yagoo	MyNickIsLongerTh	you did not use Linux since 1994. I don't have to pretend everything you say sounds smart.
2011-10-16T02:22:00.000Z	yagoo		eh
2011-10-16T02:22:00.000Z	MyNickIsLongerTh	yagoo	I've not claimed to know everything.  I've asked a question.  Do you know the answer?  If not, it's not productive to guess how long I've been using what OS or what I know about Linux
