2007-05-11T10:30:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		Can compiling a custom kernel increase the overall speed of ubuntu?
2007-05-11T10:30:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	by a few ms at boot, maybe.
2007-05-11T10:31:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	put it this way, the speed difference will not offset the amount of time spent trying to compile one.
2007-05-11T10:32:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	unless you use your computer for a few thousand years
2007-05-11T10:32:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	surprisingly long. not to mention the amount of times you will mess it up, and read docs
2007-05-11T10:32:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	there are ways to make it more responsive than ripping the engine out
2007-05-11T10:33:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	what speed CPU do you have?
2007-05-11T10:33:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	about 3 hrs id say + 3 or so hours making it compile correctly
2007-05-11T10:35:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	there are alot of performance settings that might be disabled
2007-05-11T10:35:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	hdparm
2007-05-11T10:36:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	its a tool that shows that paramaters, like DMA are set on a particular drive
2007-05-11T10:44:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	have you got prelinking turned on?
2007-05-11T10:46:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	prelinking is not needed in feisty, sorry
2007-07-30T06:09:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	make a cup of coffee, walk around the block, make another cup of coffee, have a nap, and it might be 50% done
2007-07-30T06:09:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	yep
2007-07-30T06:09:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	~30 mins if youre lucky
2007-07-30T06:11:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	hahaha............
2007-07-30T06:11:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	um what are you compiling in there before you melt your cpu?
2007-07-30T06:13:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	good luck. btw custom kernel problems shouldnt be reported to launchpad, obviously
2007-07-30T06:18:00.000Z	Toma-	PrimoTurbo	just to be certain, make an average of how fast firefox loads with 'time firefox' then test it out after you have compiled your new kernel
2007-07-30T06:18:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo	Toma-	Will do thanks for the tip
