2006-08-16T12:36:00.000Z	typhoid		hello!  could someone please remind me where to look for    httpd?  i forget   =(
2006-08-16T12:36:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	typhoid	/etc/apache2 ?
2006-08-16T12:37:00.000Z	typhoid	fyrestrtr	nope, but thank you fro trying!
2006-08-16T12:37:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	typhoid	I didn't understand what you asked to be honest. What do you mean you can't find it?
2006-08-16T12:38:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	typhoid	sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start :)
2006-08-16T12:39:00.000Z	typhoid	fyrestrtr	thanks a ton! that's what i was looking for =D
2006-08-16T12:47:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	typhoid	apache IS httpd
2006-08-16T12:48:00.000Z	typhoid	fyrestrtr	hmm...  i'm not sure what to make of this then:  * Forcing reload of apache 2.0 web server... apache2: Could not determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1 for ServerName
2006-08-16T12:48:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	typhoid	nothing, its normal if you don't have a proper DNS setup.
2006-08-16T12:49:00.000Z	typhoid	fyrestrtr	i'm talking about the part where it says httpd is not running, and it just hangs..
2006-08-16T12:49:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	typhoid	means, that apache can't lookup your fqdn, so its using 127.0.0.1 as its server name.
2006-08-16T12:49:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	typhoid	type sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
2006-08-16T12:49:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	typhoid	then, point your browser to http://127.0.0.1/
2006-08-16T12:50:00.000Z	typhoid	fyrestrtr	, that's what I did to get the message you saw..  when i type it the command hangs up and says httpd is not running
2006-08-16T12:51:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	typhoid	just do what I said please, and tell me what you see in your browser.
2006-08-16T12:51:00.000Z	typhoid	fyrestrtr	: i did it and got this: * Forcing reload of apache 2.0 web server... apache2: Could not determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1 for ServerName
2006-08-16T12:52:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	typhoid	yes, I know what you got on the console, just browse to http://127.0.0.1/
2006-08-16T12:53:00.000Z	typhoid	fyrestrtr	the server is still running but it's not reloaded the modules..      thanks for your help though =D  i think i need to go to maybe the mono channel hehe
2006-08-16T12:54:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	typhoid	you are using mono?!
2006-08-16T13:01:00.000Z	typhoid	fyrestrtr	: yup =D     , i'm trying to at least
2006-08-16T13:02:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	typhoid	you should have said that from the beginning. The information you see on the console, is not an error messages, just informative.
