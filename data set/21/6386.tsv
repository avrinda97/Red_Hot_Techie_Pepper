2009-01-04T11:55:00.000Z	darren_		is there any thing in ubuntu that allows file/folder permissions similar to windows (this is the only fault im finding but 1 that id like to be able to use)
2009-01-04T11:55:00.000Z	darren_		i dont want to use goups if possible unless i can assign a user to multiple groups
2009-01-04T11:55:00.000Z	wj32	darren_	yes, the thing I hate most about standard linux is that security sucks
2009-01-04T11:55:00.000Z	wj32		by security i mean the theoretical stuff like ACLs
2009-01-04T11:56:00.000Z	wj32		of course practically windows sucks at security
2009-01-04T11:56:00.000Z	wj32	darren_	try using a filesystem which supports ACLs like XFS or JFS
2009-01-04T11:57:00.000Z	darren_	wj32	could you expand on that please (also i dont htink it sucks)
2009-01-04T11:57:00.000Z	wj32	darren_	you don't think just having the simplistic model of user, group, and world sucks? well, some filesystems support ACLs, if that's what you're looking for
2009-01-04T11:58:00.000Z	wj32	darren_	i'm presuming you want to assign permissions to specific users
2009-01-04T11:58:00.000Z	darren_	wj32	just makes it difficult haha. yes thats what i want to do
2009-01-04T11:59:00.000Z	wj32	darren_	what filesystem do you use?
2009-01-04T11:59:00.000Z	wj32	darren_	or to make it more specific, what filesystem is the file/folder you want to control on
2009-01-04T11:59:00.000Z	darren_	wj32	ok i dont know what im using, i just installed ubuntu haha
2009-01-04T12:00:00.000Z	wj32	darren_	ok then i'm assuming you're using ext3. that does have support for ACLs i think. you'll have to use command line tools to set ACLs though
2009-01-04T12:01:00.000Z	darren_	wj32	ok ill look into that on good old google thanks
2009-01-04T12:01:00.000Z	wj32	darren_	try getfattr and setfattr
2009-01-04T12:01:00.000Z	darren_	wj32	my package manager shows i have acl installed
2009-01-04T12:02:00.000Z	wj32	darren_	you need the "attr" package
2009-01-04T12:02:00.000Z	darren_	wj32	and how do i get that?
2009-01-04T12:03:00.000Z	wj32	darren_	actually, try google. i'm not so sure the "attr" package is what you're looking for
2009-01-04T12:03:00.000Z	darren_	wj32	ok will do cheers mate
