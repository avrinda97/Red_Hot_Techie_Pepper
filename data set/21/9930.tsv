2009-09-24T15:45:00.000Z	shawn_		Theres like this thing to add to my toolbar on Ubuntu that can change my CPU frequency... Whats the difference if I have it on 1.60 Ghz or 2.13
2009-09-24T15:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	shawn_	speed and power draw. more speed more power (and heat)
2009-09-25T00:55:00.000Z	shawn_	erUSUL	Have you ever tried the 64 bit version?  Will I still beable to use most of the programs in synaptic?
2009-09-25T00:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	shawn_	yes reinstall is the best option
2009-09-25T00:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	shawn_	i run 64 bit since intrepid
2009-09-25T00:56:00.000Z	shawn_	erUSUL	and everything works fine?
2009-09-25T00:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	shawn_	yes
2009-09-25T00:56:00.000Z	shawn_	erUSUL	thanks Ill definately switch to that now then to take advantage of my 8 gigs of RAM
2009-09-29T01:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	shawn_	could be just that they choose to put the version of the bios in the filename extension
2009-09-29T01:07:00.000Z	shawn_	erUSUL	could it sitll be a .bin and I should treat it like that?
2009-09-29T01:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	shawn_	yes; but really check carefully the instructions in the manufacturer website. Be very carefull a wrong bios flashing can brick your motherboard
2009-09-29T01:09:00.000Z	shawn_	erUSUL	well the guide MSI gave me with the download is ridiculous... Its telling me to execute an exe (flasher) from the A: prompt that wasnt even the same exe as the one they gave me and telling me to use a Bios file that isnt that same number
2009-09-29T01:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	shawn_	:|
2009-09-29T01:10:00.000Z	shawn_	erUSUL	does it assume Im going to go download a flasher from somewhere else?
2009-09-29T01:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	shawn_	you should only use the tools the manufacturer gaves you
2009-09-29T01:11:00.000Z	shawn_	erUSUL	then the guide is wrong they gave me
2009-09-29T01:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	shawn_	in the msi website ?
2009-09-29T01:12:00.000Z	shawn_	erUSUL	yessir
2009-09-29T01:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	shawn_	i do not know what more to add. is your decision to make... to flash the bios with what you got or not
2009-10-17T22:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	shawn_	sudo lsof -i :ftpport
2009-10-17T22:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	shawn_	yep the --> very secure ftp daemon
