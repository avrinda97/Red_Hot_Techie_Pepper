2008-06-06T03:54:00.000Z	DJ_Cranky		here is my question, i am trying to configure samba, i am admin, but i do not own /var/lib/samba/usershares it is owned by root i need permissions there in order to add shares is there any way to do this in sudo without logging in to root as i do not think that is a good idea
2008-06-06T03:55:00.000Z	DJ_Cranky		anyone know?
2008-06-06T03:55:00.000Z	DJ_Cranky		what is that?
2008-06-06T03:56:00.000Z	DJ_Cranky		yes, the folder is owned by root
2008-06-06T03:56:00.000Z	DJ_Cranky		i know it is bad to log in as root so i need to know how to take ownership in sudo
2008-06-06T03:56:00.000Z	DJ_Cranky		right?
2008-06-06T03:57:00.000Z	thesilentwarrior	DJ_Cranky	i am trying to make a simple right-click -> Sharing Options -> Share

2008-06-06T04:07:00.000Z	DJ_Cranky	thesilentwarrior	yes i did, would you like to know how
2008-06-06T04:08:00.000Z	DJ_Cranky	thesilentwarrior	sudo -s | cd /var/lib/samba | chmod 777 usershares    - |'s indicate new lines of terminal code
2008-06-06T04:09:00.000Z	thesilentwarrior	DJ_Cranky	chmod: cannot access `usershares': No such file or directory
2008-06-06T04:10:00.000Z	DJ_Cranky	thesilentwarrior	try mkdir usershares?
2008-06-06T04:10:00.000Z	thesilentwarrior	DJ_Cranky	duh xD, but now  bash: echo: write error: Broken pipe
2008-06-06T04:10:00.000Z	DJ_Cranky	thesilentwarrior	you sudo'd right/.
2008-06-06T04:11:00.000Z	thesilentwarrior	DJ_Cranky	yes,  sudo -s | cd /var/lib/samba | chmod 777 Share
2008-06-06T04:11:00.000Z	DJ_Cranky	thesilentwarrior	you need to chmod 777 usershares not Share
2008-06-06T04:12:00.000Z	thesilentwarrior	DJ_Cranky	Share is the name of folder
2008-06-06T04:12:00.000Z	DJ_Cranky	thesilentwarrior	the folder needs to be called usershares in order for samba service to work with it
2008-06-06T04:13:00.000Z	thesilentwarrior	DJ_Cranky	same error ><
