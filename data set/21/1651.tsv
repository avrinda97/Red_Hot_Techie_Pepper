2010-07-14T11:34:00.000Z	thune3	no-name-	is that ^M carriage-return (possibly on the first line of the ./configure script) causing a problem?
2010-07-14T11:36:00.000Z	no-name-	thune3	no idea
2010-07-14T11:36:00.000Z	thune3	no-name-	can you pastebin the configure script?
2010-07-14T11:37:00.000Z	no-name-	thune3	ok
2010-07-14T11:37:00.000Z	no-name-	thune3	http://pastebin.com/qhVYSEz2
2010-07-14T11:38:00.000Z	no-name-	thune3	not sure why that came up as double lined
2010-07-14T11:39:00.000Z	thune3	no-name-	if there is a space on the first line between #! and /bin/sh, i think it needs to be removed.
2010-07-14T11:40:00.000Z	no-name-	thune3	removed the space. same error
2010-07-14T11:41:00.000Z	thune3	no-name-	then the error might be because each line is terminated with CR and then NEWLINE. (which is why the double space in pastebin)
2010-07-14T11:41:00.000Z	no-name-	thune3	ok. what do i do to fix that?
2010-07-14T11:47:00.000Z	thune3	no-name-	do you have a link to the original package that has the configure file. I need to test a command before recommending it.
2010-07-14T11:47:00.000Z	no-name-	thune3	yea sure
2010-07-14T11:48:00.000Z	no-name-	thune3	http://www.gens.me/downloads.shtml ----> Gens 2.14 Source
2010-07-14T11:48:00.000Z	thune3	no-name-	an easier option might be to add a line at the top #!/bin/sh, and then remove the original one below it. But i'll test commands
2010-07-14T11:50:00.000Z	no-name-	thune3	#!/bin/sh, or #!/bin/sh    ?
2010-07-14T11:57:00.000Z	no-name-	thune3	any luck with that command?
2010-07-14T12:02:00.000Z	thune3	no-name-	geirha has it. "dos2unix" if you want that is available in package 'tofrodos', though the others will work.
2010-07-14T12:20:00.000Z	thune3	no-name-	i ran tofrodos on your configure file and it certianly fixed the first problem, i then also had to run it on config.sub and config.guess. Configure then ran but hit some weird error later.
2010-07-14T12:20:00.000Z	thune3	no-name-	i mean dos2unix
2010-07-14T12:22:00.000Z	no-name-	thune3	this is weird i installed tofrodos but there is no dos2unix command
2010-07-14T12:29:00.000Z	thune3	no-name-	that is bizarre, should be in /usr/bin/dos2unix : This is equivalent and works: tr -d "\015" < ./configure > ./configure
