2007-02-13T12:33:00.000Z	pavs		whats the most important linux certification?
2007-02-13T12:33:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	personal opinion
2007-02-13T12:35:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	so forget about certification until your not new
2007-02-13T12:36:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	how about just play with linux
2007-02-13T12:36:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	forget certification
2007-02-13T12:37:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	you'll get no-one with out just playing
2007-02-13T12:40:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	how do you know its interesting if you've not read it ?
2007-02-13T12:41:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	thats crap - you can't base a topic you know nothing about as "interesting" based on a few pages of a book you've not read
2007-02-13T12:42:00.000Z	pavs	ikonia	"interesting" is an opinion, you may not share it.
2007-02-13T12:43:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	its like me reading a few pages of atomic fusion - and saying "interesting topic" I know nothing about atomic fusion, so I can't make that call reading a few pages on a topic I know nothing about
2007-02-13T12:45:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	but how do you know it interests you when you know nothing about it ?
2007-02-13T12:47:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	then why did you say you where new to linux - if you know ubuntu ?
2007-02-13T12:48:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	so 3 weeks = not know ubuntu
2007-02-13T12:54:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	thats nonsense
2007-02-13T12:55:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	the layout of components and the package managment is the main difference
2007-02-13T12:55:00.000Z	pavs	ikonia	calling me crap and now nonsense:)
2007-02-13T12:55:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	I didn't call you crap
2007-02-13T12:55:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	I said your statment was nonsense
2007-02-13T12:56:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	its not about making me happy - you just made a wrong statment
2007-02-13T12:57:00.000Z	pavs	ikonia	package management in most major distro are differant anyways
2007-02-13T12:57:00.000Z	ikonia	pavs	not really as there are only 3 or 4 main ones, but the 3 or 4 main ones are the ones that seperate themselves
