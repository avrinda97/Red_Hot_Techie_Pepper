2007-03-01T08:26:00.000Z	dyrne	Kawasaxi	windows? ntfs?
2007-03-01T08:29:00.000Z	dyrne	Kawasaxi	think of root as c:\  and swap as your page file
2007-03-01T08:29:00.000Z	dyrne	Kawasaxi	swap is virtual memory
2007-03-01T08:30:00.000Z	dyrne	Kawasaxi	well it depends. but if you are just going to have / and swap   which is the simplest setup then yes. swap should just be equal to ram generally
2007-03-01T08:33:00.000Z	dyrne	Kawasaxi	id recommend at 5 gigs at least maybe 8 or so since everything is going under / but base install at least 4 gigs id say
2007-03-01T08:33:00.000Z	dyrne	Kawasaxi	desktop or laptop?
2007-03-01T08:34:00.000Z	dyrne	Kawasaxi	the only real reason for swap == ram is for hibernate. i dont really have more than 256mb for swap on my desktop
2007-03-01T08:40:00.000Z	dyrne	Kawasaxi	resize your windows you mean?
2007-03-01T08:41:00.000Z	dyrne	Kawasaxi	ive never done that so im not sure.  i havent used the livecd really yet
2007-03-01T08:41:00.000Z	dyrne	Kawasaxi	server installs
2007-03-01T08:43:00.000Z	dyrne	Kawasaxi	from livecd you might just run gparted if its installed if not just install it from package manager. but you might not need to to that
