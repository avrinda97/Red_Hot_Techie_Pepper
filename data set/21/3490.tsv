2008-12-13T03:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_eXeCuTeR	Installing via apt / synaptic didn't work?
2008-12-13T03:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_eXeCuTeR	Whait before you do that
2008-12-13T03:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_eXeCuTeR	What was the problem with the version of bochs from the repositories ( synaptic / apt-get ) ?
2008-12-13T03:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_eXeCuTeR	What happens when you run "sudo apt-get install bochs" is there an error? If so please pastebin it
2008-12-13T03:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_eXeCuTeR	What files, there are other packages available like "bochsbios" that might have what you need
2010-08-19T23:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_eXeCuTeR	Yes, that would work.
2010-08-19T23:19:00.000Z	_eXeCuTeR	Jordan_U	didn't work :o
2010-08-19T23:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_eXeCuTeR	In what way did it not work?
2010-08-20T01:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_eXeCuTeR	Do you have universe enabled? (unless you're in a LiveCD session it should be enabled by default).
2010-08-20T01:02:00.000Z	_eXeCuTeR	Jordan_U	when I go to synaptics, there are really not much of packages.
2010-08-20T01:03:00.000Z	_eXeCuTeR	Jordan_U	universe enabled? don't know what's that and i'm not using LIVECD
2010-08-20T01:03:00.000Z	_eXeCuTeR	Jordan_U	running sudo apt-get update now. hold on
2010-08-20T01:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_eXeCuTeR	Open System > Administration > Software Sources and make sure that all of the "Downloadable from the internet" check boxes (except source, which isn't needed but can't hurt) are checked.
