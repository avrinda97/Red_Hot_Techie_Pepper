2009-01-06T15:16:00.000Z	Louando		hi, i have ubuntu running as a NAT for my network
2009-01-06T15:16:00.000Z	Louando		every now and then webbrowsing
2009-01-06T15:16:00.000Z	Louando		i get blank pages
2009-01-06T15:16:00.000Z	Louando		and i have to refresh to view the content?
2009-01-06T15:17:00.000Z	Louando		what would cause such an issue?
2009-01-06T15:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Louando	ping a web ip, for 10 - 15 mins, see if packets get dropped
2009-01-06T15:18:00.000Z	Louando	ActionParsnip1	it is not dropping anything?
2009-01-06T15:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Louando	browse the web, when it happens, check the ping
2009-01-06T15:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Louando	no packet loss when the pages are blank?
2009-01-06T15:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Louando	try pings from the client system instead of the router box, see if they are dropped
2009-01-06T15:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Louando	ping from the route box out and browse
2009-01-06T15:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Louando	maybe you could check the logs on the router box
2009-01-06T15:23:00.000Z	Louando	ActionParsnip1	syslog would have details?
2009-01-06T15:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Louando	run the http proxy with logging enabled and read the logs
2009-01-06T15:24:00.000Z	Louando	ActionParsnip1	error does not present when running a proxy
2009-01-06T15:27:00.000Z	Louando	ActionParsnip1	ubuntu-server doesnt come with anything annoying like grsecurity or similar
2009-01-06T15:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Louando	i couldnt tell you, ive never needed to use it
2009-01-06T15:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Louando	my current server runs gentoo
2009-01-06T15:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Louando	id check your ics settings on the sharing box
2009-01-06T15:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Louando	takes about 2 hours to get an ok system with me but my connection is slow and so are my computers so I leave them overnight doing stuff
2009-01-06T15:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Louando	that may help (the factoid links)
