2008-06-27T22:24:00.000Z	DJAdmiral		Hey, I'm installing Ubuntu on my Dad's laptop - this is the first time I've seen the Install inside Windows option - what advantages does it have over having a separate partition for Ubuntu?

2008-06-27T22:26:00.000Z	Wolphie	DJAdmiral	Please elaborate
2008-06-27T22:27:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Wolphie	Well I'm using the Desktop 8.04 install CD
2008-06-27T22:28:00.000Z	Wolphie	DJAdmiral	A partition is exactly like having another hard drive, except partitions are on the same hard drive.
2008-06-27T22:28:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Wolphie	I'm not *that* stupid.
2008-06-27T22:28:00.000Z	Wolphie	DJAdmiral	If the operating system has access to the hard drive, then all you need to do is mount the partitions in linux.
2008-06-27T22:30:00.000Z	Wolphie	DJAdmiral	No, you cannot boot ubuntu from within windows (like with a virtual machine), you have to select what operating system to boot from in the boot manager
2008-06-27T22:30:00.000Z	Wolphie	DJAdmiral	However, using wubi is much the same as installing Linux and Windows on seperate partitions
2008-06-27T22:31:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Wolphie	unop: I see. So there's no real advantage other than not having to bother with partitions whatsoever.
2008-06-27T22:31:00.000Z	Wolphie	DJAdmiral	The only difference is that you can access the Linux file system from within windows. But you've always been able to access the windows partition inside linux if you mount it and it's not locked
2008-06-27T22:32:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Wolphie	That's what I wanted to know - you can access the linux filesystem from within windows to copy files from ubuntu to linux, correct?
2008-06-27T22:32:00.000Z	Wolphie	DJAdmiral	No, there isn't an advantage in that respect. However, if you're like me and enjoy learning new things then it's best to do it all yourself
2008-06-27T22:34:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Wolphie	unop: but can you access the linux filesystem from within windows, Wolphie?
2008-06-27T22:35:00.000Z	Wolphie	DJAdmiral	Yes, you can. Except you need to be careful when moving files back and forth, and putting them into the right directories.
2008-06-27T22:35:00.000Z	Wolphie	DJAdmiral	Otherwise you could corrupt the ubuntu installation.
2008-06-27T22:35:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Wolphie	Exactly how can you do this?
2008-06-27T22:36:00.000Z	Wolphie	DJAdmiral	Ubuntu is installed under the C: drive, C:\ubuntu I think.
2008-06-27T22:36:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Wolphie	But can you go into C:\ubuntu and copy files from there?
2008-06-27T22:37:00.000Z	Wolphie	DJAdmiral	I don't see no reason why not, although I don't use Wubi. But I would assume so.
2008-06-27T22:37:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Wolphie	unop: I believe it would be installed into a file, because of the filesystem differences and limitations. I'll do some googling.
