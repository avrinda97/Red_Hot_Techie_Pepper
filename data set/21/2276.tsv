2012-01-27T03:01:00.000Z	jeagle		Anyone know how to make a multi-page pdf text-readable via the command line? :)
2012-01-27T03:03:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jeagle	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdftotext
2012-01-27T03:03:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jeagle	i've used a related tool, pdftohtml, it worked okay
2012-01-27T03:04:00.000Z	jeagle	aeon-ltd	Yeah I just need to make it text readable. Does it convert it to another format? It has to stay in pdf when I'm done. :3
2012-01-27T03:05:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jeagle	i don't think there is utility that can just 'read' it on the fly and keep it as it is
2012-01-27T03:06:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jeagle	but you'll get the pdf then it's text form as 2 different files, that's how it was with pdftohtml
2012-01-27T03:07:00.000Z	jeagle	aeon-ltd	ok, so it outputed the text as a text file, how would I layer the text then on the pdf? :)
2012-01-27T03:07:00.000Z	jeagle	aeon-ltd	Thank you for helping me!^-^
2012-01-27T03:09:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jeagle	what do you mean 'layer the text'?
2012-01-27T03:12:00.000Z	jeagle	aeon-ltd	Ok, for example, when you have a PDF file, you want to be able to select or highlight text. So you have to use OCR or some other way to recognize text and it layers it on top of the pdf file.
2012-01-27T03:13:00.000Z	jeagle	aeon-ltd	My posts are really delayed today. @.@
2012-01-27T03:19:00.000Z	jeagle	aeon-ltd	Any thoughts ?^-^
2012-01-27T03:20:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jeagle	yes sounds possible
2012-01-27T03:20:00.000Z	jeagle	aeon-ltd	Hoping I fixed this huge lag issue. lol
2012-01-27T03:20:00.000Z	jeagle	aeon-ltd	Yay I did!^-^
2012-01-27T03:21:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jeagle	i've never used pdftotext so i don't know how accurate it is
2012-01-27T03:21:00.000Z	jeagle	aeon-ltd	I've been searching for days... It's really tough finding a solution... To be honest, I don't care about accuracy, I just need to select the text and highlight it. :)
2012-01-27T03:23:00.000Z	jeagle	aeon-ltd	I'm wrting a script that merges several file types into one MASTER pdf file. then It has to have text-readable functionality added to it.
2012-01-27T03:23:00.000Z	jeagle	aeon-ltd	Very tough, though pdftotext seems to be promissing if I can layer them on top of eachother. :)
2012-01-27T03:24:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jeagle	ok, good luck with project
2012-01-27T03:25:00.000Z	jeagle	aeon-ltd	Thank you so much for your help^^
