2005-04-04T09:18:00.000Z	karsten		what's the supported upgrade path from Debian woody = Ubuntu?  Hoary or Warty?
2005-04-04T09:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karsten	there isn't a "supported" path, AFAIK :)
2005-04-04T09:20:00.000Z	karsten	thoreauputic	IIRC there was an item on the Wiki about it.
2005-04-04T09:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karsten	hmm... OK... I guess it's possible - as far as I know, it's not encouraged ;)
2005-04-04T09:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karsten	but if you're the karsten I'm thinking you are, you will know how to avoid the pitfalls
2005-04-04T09:21:00.000Z	karsten	thoreauputic	Got someone trying an Debian install w/ ls-120 superdisk, floppy, various rootfs issues.  My recommendation is to either put the HD in another system or another system's CD in this one.
2005-04-04T09:22:00.000Z	karsten	thoreauputic	I can.  The n00b I'm assisting may not ;-)
2005-04-04T09:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karsten	:)
2005-04-04T09:22:00.000Z	karsten	thoreauputic	Yo're you IRL?
2005-04-04T09:22:00.000Z	karsten	thoreauputic	s/Yo/who/
2005-04-04T09:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karsten	sorry I lost you there ?
2005-04-04T09:24:00.000Z	karsten	thoreauputic	Where do I know you from?
2005-04-04T09:24:00.000Z	karsten	thoreauputic	...or vice versa.
2005-04-04T09:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karsten	a /whois tells me who you are and I've red some of your stuff :)
2005-04-04T09:24:00.000Z	karsten	thoreauputic	OK.
2005-04-04T09:25:00.000Z	karsten	thoreauputic	I get that a lot ;-)
2005-04-04T09:27:00.000Z	karsten	thoreauputic	Wrote the book, kthx
2005-04-04T09:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karsten	hehe
2005-05-14T13:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karsten	"badvertised" is a nice typo ;)
2005-05-14T13:42:00.000Z	karsten	thoreauputic	Who says it's a typo?
2005-05-14T13:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	karsten	heheh OK, just checking - a nice coinage then ;)
