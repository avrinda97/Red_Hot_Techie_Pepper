2006-06-18T15:42:00.000Z	Bassetts		when using screen, how do i close a screen
2006-06-18T15:43:00.000Z	jrib	Bassetts	ctrl-a ?   <-- that will give you a nice list of commands
2006-07-05T16:14:00.000Z	jrib	Bassetts	tr
2006-07-05T16:14:00.000Z	Bassetts	jrib	what is tr?
2006-07-05T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	Bassetts	a program, 'man tr' for the full story, but for what you want you can do: tr '[A-Z] ' '[a-z] ' < infile > outfile
2006-10-15T06:28:00.000Z	jrib	Bassetts	foobar2000 is nice
2007-06-23T06:36:00.000Z	jrib	Bassetts	~/.irssi/scripts/   you mean scripts?
2007-06-23T06:37:00.000Z	Bassetts	jrib	yes, i made a folder called scripts in ~/.irssi but it keeps saying script not found
2007-06-23T06:37:00.000Z	jrib	Bassetts	how are you trying to load it?
2007-06-23T06:38:00.000Z	jrib	Bassetts	does it work if you omit the ".pl"?
2007-06-23T06:38:00.000Z	Bassetts	jrib	no
2007-06-23T06:39:00.000Z	jrib	Bassetts	that should work, does it tab complete it?
2007-06-23T06:39:00.000Z	Bassetts	jrib	no
2007-06-23T06:41:00.000Z	jrib	Bassetts	check spelling (it's probably case sensitive) and try a different script
2007-06-23T06:42:00.000Z	Bassetts	jrib	ok
2007-06-26T07:38:00.000Z	jrib	Bassetts	you can add places if you create a bookmark in nautilus
2007-06-26T07:39:00.000Z	Bassetts	jrib	ubuntu has added two folders to the places menu that i dont want there
2007-06-26T07:39:00.000Z	jrib	Bassetts	which ones
2007-06-26T07:40:00.000Z	Bassetts	jrib	Downloads was a bookmark, but Documents is fixed there
2007-06-26T07:41:00.000Z	jrib	Bassetts	yeah someone asked this once.  It's an ubuntu (debian?) patch to nautilus.  The only way to make it not do that is either call the folder something other than "Documents" or to rebuild the package without the patch
2007-06-26T07:42:00.000Z	Bassetts	jrib	ok, ill just make my folders lowercase, its the linux way anyway
