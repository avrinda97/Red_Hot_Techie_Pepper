2006-01-25T15:04:00.000Z	ompaul	nevyn	I have run debian unstable and experimental but that is another story
2006-01-25T15:04:00.000Z	nevyn	ompaul	you think it breaks less than ubuntu unstable or more?
2006-01-25T15:05:00.000Z	nevyn	ompaul	the options were dapper or go to linux.conf.au running XP and that would have got me lynched ;)
2006-01-25T15:05:00.000Z	ompaul	nevyn	ahhh now there is something, that is a reason for running it
2006-01-25T15:07:00.000Z	ompaul	nevyn	considering that in October it was SID but is getting to Ubuntu stable then the path starts out rocky and then turns into stable
2006-01-25T15:08:00.000Z	nevyn	ompaul	they have sync's still
2006-01-25T15:08:00.000Z	ompaul	nevyn	that time and curve of smoothing things over is not at all like deb

2006-01-25T15:12:00.000Z	nevyn	ompaul	I find navigation of ubuntu's systems less straightforward than debian but it may just be what I'm used to
2006-01-25T15:13:00.000Z	ompaul	nevyn	http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/dapper-changes is for the software updates and there is something during an install of "let us know your hardware" ther is something on the wiki but I have not had a coffee yet - trying to ween self off that stuff
