2012-11-05T03:49:00.000Z	bsmith0931		i have a very old palm m130, i want to read text files on it, what encodings do i need
2012-11-05T03:50:00.000Z	dsprc	bsmith0931	they have their own format. but you can use jpilot and its utilities to send and recieve palmdoc files from the device
2012-11-05T03:51:00.000Z	bsmith0931		jpilot isnt working
2012-11-05T03:51:00.000Z	bsmith0931		i have the cradle and the usb connection to the computer
2012-11-05T03:51:00.000Z	dsprc	bsmith0931	are you able to hotsync the device?
2012-11-05T03:51:00.000Z	bsmith0931		yes but only on windows
2012-11-05T03:52:00.000Z	bsmith0931		im on ubuntu lucid
2012-11-05T03:55:00.000Z	dsprc	bsmith0931	have you played around with the "sync port" settings yet?
2012-11-05T03:56:00.000Z	dsprc	bsmith0931	should have had this problem last week before my m130 died on me :P
2012-11-05T03:57:00.000Z	bsmith0931	dsprc	 to try and make it work yestreday, i dont even remeemberdsprc:  ummm, maybe i did so many tweaky thing
2012-11-05T04:01:00.000Z	dsprc	bsmith0931	you can try to 'dmesg | tail' and see if its being recognized
2012-11-05T04:02:00.000Z	bsmith0931	dsprc	i did the "press the hotsync button" -fu but it never worked
2012-11-05T04:03:00.000Z	dsprc	bsmith0931	assuming everything is kosher, you sometimes have to be ninja on the hotsync and press it from the palm first, then quickly again in jpilot
2012-11-05T04:03:00.000Z	bsmith0931	dsprc	also, i have a crapload of text files sorted into many different folders, what will make them readable on the palm, wi\th minimal garbage chars due to encoding probelms?
2012-11-05T04:04:00.000Z	dsprc	bsmith0931	are you using a specific reader or just Memo on the palm?
2012-11-05T04:05:00.000Z	bsmith0931		umm how would i use memo on the palm
2012-11-05T04:07:00.000Z	dsprc	bsmith0931	you just import them in the palmdoc format and $DEITY willing they automagically appear there
2012-11-05T04:07:00.000Z	bsmith0931	dsprc	what palmdoc format
2012-11-05T04:07:00.000Z	bsmith0931	dsprc	can memo read sd cards?
2012-11-05T04:09:00.000Z	dsprc	bsmith0931	it should be able to (IIRC) by ticking the menu at the top right and selecting the card. havent used the m1xx series i years tho.
2012-11-05T04:13:00.000Z	dsprc	bsmith0931	youre better off getting a dedicated reader though. http://www.memoware.com/mw.cgi/?screen=help_format
