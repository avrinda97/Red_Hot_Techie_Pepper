2005-02-24T16:11:00.000Z	bascule	saif	if you compiled it yourself that is
2005-02-24T16:12:00.000Z	saif	bascule	no, i have the installation cd!

2005-02-24T16:16:00.000Z	bascule	saif	you have installed ubuntu, or this is during the install?
2005-02-24T16:16:00.000Z	saif	bascule	right at the start.
2005-02-24T16:17:00.000Z	saif	bascule	well, i used the same cdrom to instal into 3 other machines and i had no problems!
2005-02-24T16:17:00.000Z	bascule	saif	did you check the md5 of the disc before burning it?
2005-02-24T16:17:00.000Z	bascule	saif	it isn't a tiny machine mith an MSI crom is it?
2005-02-24T16:18:00.000Z	saif	bascule	it's anormal machine, not tiny, and the disc is the one that i got from ubuntu ( official ) the motherboard is slotek and cpu amd

2005-02-24T16:20:00.000Z	saif	bascule	oh, nop never heard of it, it's not the tiny pc manufacturer, nor is it Tiny! :) yes, VIA
2005-02-24T16:21:00.000Z	bascule	saif	I had a machine for repair the other day, Tiny VIA chipset, not even knoppix could boot it, XP was fine though :(

2005-02-24T16:23:00.000Z	bascule	saif	try knoppix on it, see how it does, if it is fine submit an ubuntu bug to the ISO section
