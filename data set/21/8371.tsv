2006-06-05T11:52:00.000Z	troy_s		flannel:  i think you are ill informed.
2006-06-05T11:53:00.000Z	troy_s		aj_riddle: knowledge first and foremost.
2006-06-05T11:53:00.000Z	troy_s		aj_riddle:  that said, i would feel a whole lot better starting with openbsd as a webserver for you out of the gate.
2006-06-05T11:54:00.000Z	troy_s		aj_riddle:  it has a plethora of more secure features.  further still, you will learn enough about how a server operates to be more confident with linux.
2006-06-05T11:54:00.000Z	troy_s		aj_riddle:  you need build-essential.
2006-06-05T11:55:00.000Z	troy_s		aj_riddle:  needless to say, don't rush it.  learn as much as you can before you setout to prevent bad habits and bad exploitation potential.
2006-06-05T11:56:00.000Z	troy_s		angfangs:  you only have one option across a network if you want security:  ssh.
2006-06-05T11:56:00.000Z	troy_s		cokencode:  locate requires a database:  use find (man find for more info)
2006-06-05T11:57:00.000Z	troy_s		cokencode: add xchat via apt-get or another package manager frontend.
