2008-09-24T20:45:00.000Z	bdbdbd		fresh install of ubuntu
2008-09-24T20:45:00.000Z	bdbdbd		installed SDL successfully?
2008-09-24T20:45:00.000Z	bdbdbd		removed sdl-debian
2008-09-24T20:45:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bdbdbd	SDL says WTFF ? wow :)
2008-09-24T20:47:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bdbdbd	Have you checked the forums?
2008-09-24T20:47:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bdbdbd	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=896050
2008-09-24T20:48:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bdbdbd	indeed
2008-09-24T20:49:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bdbdbd	have you checked the ./configure options and config.status report to see if it isn't used some library that is required for what you need?
2008-09-24T20:51:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bdbdbd	when you run ./configure there are usually many options you can pass, and the Ubuntu packages will do that from their debian/rules script. Maybe you're not including all the options needed to create the package in a configuration that is suitable
2008-09-24T20:53:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bdbdbd	Why would it?
2008-09-24T21:15:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bdbdbd	Where are you getting the source from? Let me try recreating the issue
2008-09-24T21:17:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bdbdbd	SDL-1.2.13.tar.gz ?
2008-09-24T21:18:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bdbdbd	ok... what is the ./configure command you're issuing ?
2008-09-24T21:23:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bdbdbd	If you examine the build logs (https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libsdl1.2/1.2.13-1ubuntu1/+build/483974) for the Ubuntu package you'll see it uses "./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-rpath --enable-dlopen --enable-dependency-tracking --enable-arts-shared=no --enable-alsa-shared=no --enable-esd-shared=no --enable-pulseaudio-shared=no --build x86_64-linux-gnu --disable-debug $SWITCHES)"
2008-09-24T21:23:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bdbdbd	no!!!
2008-09-24T21:24:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bdbdbd	That is based on a set of patches being applied so likely won't work... I'm just pointing out key differences you need to investigate
2008-09-24T21:25:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bdbdbd	install the ubuntu source package and inspect it to see the patches it applies: apt-get source libsdl1.2debian
2008-09-25T02:01:00.000Z	bdbdbd	IntuitiveNipple	any idea what to do?  even the version you gave me reports SDL_INIT_VIDEO problems
2008-09-25T02:03:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	bdbdbd	It sounds like you've not got the prerequisites that SDL expects. I don't use it so I can't help there
