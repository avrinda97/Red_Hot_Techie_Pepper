2010-05-22T03:56:00.000Z	john_someguy		Helloo. My Fujitsu Siemens computer is running hot. How do I enable power management, cpu scaling, or speedstep.. or something to keep it cool
2010-05-22T03:57:00.000Z	dancek	john_someguy	are you sure it's not just the way the computer is (i know many fujitsu-siemens laptops are really hot)
2010-05-22T03:58:00.000Z	john_someguy	dancek	wait...
2010-05-22T03:58:00.000Z	john_someguy	dancek	cpufrequtils-info gives: current CPU frequency is 800 MHz
2010-05-22T03:59:00.000Z	dancek	john_someguy	what cpu is it?
2010-05-22T03:59:00.000Z	john_someguy	dancek	its a celeron 1.7ghz.. so i guess speedstep works?
2010-05-22T03:59:00.000Z	dancek	john_someguy	so it seems
2010-05-22T03:59:00.000Z	john_someguy	dancek	its so anoying, the fan runs at 100% most of the time. stops 10 secs. then goes again! driving me nuts. how about undervolt?
2010-05-22T04:02:00.000Z	dancek	john_someguy	you might want to open the computer and use pressurized air to get all the accumulated dust out... i don't really know about kernel powersave features other than speedstep
2010-05-22T04:02:00.000Z	dancek	john_someguy	someone else here might know more about linux cpu power management
2010-05-22T04:02:00.000Z	john_someguy	dancek	ok thanks. well i did try to clean it... maybe i should drill some holes :D
2010-05-22T04:03:00.000Z	john_someguy		!tell me about undervolting
2010-05-22T04:03:00.000Z	dancek	john_someguy	how old is the computer btw?
2010-05-22T04:03:00.000Z	john_someguy	dancek	manufactured late 2005... it's an Amilo Pro v2045
2010-05-22T04:04:00.000Z	dancek	john_someguy	i'm a little interested since i've had a fujitsu-siemens laptop myself in 2007 or so, and actually i've only had bad experiences with their machines :)
2010-05-22T04:05:00.000Z	dancek	john_someguy	also my girlfriend currently has one and my mother another one :P
2010-05-22T04:06:00.000Z	john_someguy	dancek	ok cool :) well, this is my first fujitsu... just bought it 2nd hand just to have a laptop. normally i'm on a stationary one
2010-05-22T04:06:00.000Z	dancek	john_someguy	ok, well good luck with it :)
2010-05-22T04:07:00.000Z	john_someguy	dancek	i do believe there can be some serious undervolting to this machine. speedstep works fine, so it's getting too much juice :((
2010-05-22T04:07:00.000Z	john_someguy	dancek	thanks :)
2010-05-22T04:08:00.000Z	dancek	john_someguy	happy to help!
