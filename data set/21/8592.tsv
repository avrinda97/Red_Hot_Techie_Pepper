2006-05-28T09:46:00.000Z	NoelJB		well, I guess I'll see if anyone has any thoughts on this cardbus problem while I start burning RHEL install disks <<sigh>>
2006-05-28T09:48:00.000Z	NoelJB		Or is this some OTHER server that you are trying to connect to?
2006-05-28T09:49:00.000Z	nickrud	NoelJB	have you searched the wiki for _usable_ cardbus info
2006-05-28T09:51:00.000Z	NoelJB	nickrud	such as?  and please note again: it WORKS if I boot the LiveCD, it FAILS when I boot the installed system that the LiveCD installed.
2006-05-28T09:53:00.000Z	nickrud	NoelJB	http://wiki.ubuntu.com ; and check https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bugs as well
2006-05-28T09:53:00.000Z	NoelJB	nickrud	anything specific, or just a blanket suggestion?  Because I've been there and elsewhere googling and searching for this stuff.
2006-05-28T09:54:00.000Z	nickrud	NoelJB	no, a lot of people don't know those resources, wasn't sure if you did. You sounded like you could make a decent bug report
2006-05-28T09:55:00.000Z	NoelJB	nickrud	probably, expecially if I had the time.  I have a friend who works at Ubuntu, so I'll ping him during the week and pass it directly.
2006-05-28T09:57:00.000Z	NoelJB	nickrud	by the way, if you see people complaining that VMware and Dapper don't play well, the two things I found were (a) you need to install linux-headers-<arch> because linux-kernel-headers still refers to the old kernel --- that will allow you to compile the eth driver.  Next, you need to download and install special mouse and video drivers because VMware's standard ones don't ship for Xorg 7.  Details on the VMware forums.
2006-05-28T09:59:00.000Z	NoelJB	nickrud	?
2006-05-28T09:59:00.000Z	nickrud	NoelJB	just checking the bot link here
2006-05-28T10:00:00.000Z	nickrud	NoelJB	I don't use vmware, but someone might like your link
2006-05-28T10:00:00.000Z	NoelJB	nickrud	they'll need it.  The Wiki is not up-to-date on the subject.  :)
2008-01-11T10:02:00.000Z	nickrud	NoelJB	talk about it in #ubuntu+1 , they probably would want to troubleshoot it
2008-01-11T10:03:00.000Z	NoelJB	nickrud	I will, but thought that the basic question might be answerable here.  They're quiet on +1.  The more serious issue with Hardy is that hotswapping is badly broken (at least on my system for all versions of hardy).
2008-01-11T10:05:00.000Z	nickrud	NoelJB	well you are running a system that's supposed to be broken right now
2008-01-11T10:07:00.000Z	NoelJB	nickrud	I've no problem with that idea.  That's why I started testing it early and often.
2008-01-11T10:07:00.000Z	NoelJB	nickrud	like voting in Chicago.
2008-01-11T10:09:00.000Z	nickrud	NoelJB	lol, I usually wait until about a month or two before release.
2008-01-11T10:37:00.000Z	NoelJB	nickrud	I've got Gutsy on one USB external drive, Hardy on another, MS-Windows on the internal drive.  Working toward being able to ditch MS-Windows as my host system, and use Ubuntu.  So testing early and often for hardware support is key.
2008-01-11T10:38:00.000Z	nickrud	NoelJB	yup, I see your reasons. I'm more patient :)
