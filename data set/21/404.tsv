2012-01-09T01:03:00.000Z	stowoda		I am using ubuntu 11.10. How to find out if my graphics-card drivers are installed properly?
2012-01-09T01:03:00.000Z	xtreamer	stowoda	go to the system settings menu
2012-01-09T01:04:00.000Z	stowoda	xtreamer	and then?
2012-01-09T01:05:00.000Z	xtreamer	stowoda	you click on additional drivers and you should be prompted if your video driver is uptodate
2012-01-09T01:07:00.000Z	stowoda	xtreamer	no proprietary driver..
2012-01-09T01:08:00.000Z	xtreamer	stowoda	come again, what are you trying to do?

2012-01-09T01:11:00.000Z	stowoda	xtreamer	hmm. ok if you say so. thx
2012-01-09T01:13:00.000Z	xtreamer	stowoda	: try system settings -> system info -> graphics. :)
2012-01-09T01:15:00.000Z	stowoda	xtreamer	driver: unknown
2012-01-09T01:15:00.000Z	xtreamer	stowoda	that means you don't have any driver installed
2012-01-09T01:15:00.000Z	xtreamer	stowoda	go to the update manager and click check
2012-01-09T01:16:00.000Z	xtreamer	stowoda	it should find a driver for your graphics card, else you should search a driver for it on google
2012-01-09T01:16:00.000Z	stowoda	xtreamer	all right. thx
