2011-06-23T17:03:00.000Z	sammmy		is there anyway to get suspend to work with a wubi installation, or is it not possible?
2011-06-23T17:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	sammmy	 im not sure its possible..   it may need a actual swap partition.
2011-06-23T17:04:00.000Z	sammmy	dr_willis	doesn't suspend just work off the ram?
2011-06-23T17:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	sammmy	 they alwasy seem to be changeing the names...  I can never which  one is  'to ram' and what one is 'to hard drive'
2011-06-23T17:09:00.000Z	sammmy	dr_willis	suspend is to ram, while hibernate is to drive.
2011-06-23T17:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	sammmy	 i seem to recall the terms 'suspend to ram and suspend to disk' used in the past also.. :)
2011-06-24T19:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	sammmy	 you got a swap partition of at least your ram size? if not more?
2011-06-24T19:01:00.000Z	sammmy	dr_willis	I'm not sure.
2011-06-24T19:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	sammmy	 time to check i guess. :) free command, and sudo fdisk -l
2011-06-24T19:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	sammmy	 wubi? i dont think ibernate works with wubi
2011-06-24T19:02:00.000Z	sammmy	dr_willis	darn. Maybe I should consider a real partition on my drive.
2011-06-25T21:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	sammmy	 its a security feature. only the sudo/admin user can do specific things
2011-06-26T13:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	sammmy	 'gksudo gedit /path/to/file.txt'
2011-06-26T13:47:00.000Z	sammmy	dr_willis	why gksudo and not just sudo?
2011-06-26T13:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	sammmy	 run from a terminal,  getting it to use the dir from some differnt natuilus window?
2011-06-26T13:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	sammmy	 or what do you mean exactly?
2011-06-26T13:50:00.000Z	sammmy	dr_willis	well, if I have a directory open in nautilus, is there a way to run a command on that directory without needing to open terminal and then cd-ing to the directory I already have open in nautilus?
2011-06-26T13:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	sammmy	 you can drag/drop a directory icon to a terminal  window (or a file) and i think it fills in the path.
2011-06-26T13:52:00.000Z	sammmy	dr_willis	still have to open a terminal and then cd then drag and drop. Would be cool if nautilus had a run command feature, maybe in the future it will.
2011-06-26T13:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	sammmy	 ive seen nauilus variants with terminals embeded in them on the f8 key.
2011-06-26T13:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	sammmy	 to set up proper variables so gui apps run properly
