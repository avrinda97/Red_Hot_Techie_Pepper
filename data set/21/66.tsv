2012-11-03T20:55:00.000Z	gaetano		wich is the best program for developers like dreamweaver in windows?
2012-11-03T20:56:00.000Z	decbot	gaetano	are you writing html/css or are you working in something like java and c?
2012-11-03T20:58:00.000Z	gaetano	decbot	im working with HTML/CSS and java and PHP
2012-11-03T21:00:00.000Z	decbot	gaetano	geany might be as close as you get to dreamweaver. some people might use eclipse.  but even something like gedit, emacs, or vim could work
2012-11-03T21:01:00.000Z	decbot	gaetano	but I don't know of anything of the top of my head that does code completion and site synchronization
2012-11-03T21:03:00.000Z	gaetano	decbot	ok thanks! so they are right for develop site!?
2012-11-03T21:04:00.000Z	decbot	gaetano	well, it's not as complete as dreamweaver, but better than window's notepad and OSX's textedit
2012-11-03T21:05:00.000Z	decbot	gaetano	it will do the syntax highlighting, but it won't always catch bad code
2012-11-03T21:06:00.000Z	gaetano	decbot	are these programs findable on ubuntu software center?
2012-11-03T21:08:00.000Z	decbot	gaetano	I think so, I know they are in synaptic
2012-11-03T21:09:00.000Z	gaetano	decbot	so here in ubuntu there is not a program good like deamwaver for develop sites!? do u suggest to install windows alongside ubuntu if i need to develop!?
2012-11-03T21:14:00.000Z	decbot	gaetano	you can run dreamweaver in wine if you must have dreamweaver. In linux, you're more likely to use more simple tools to accomplish a task than using a single complex tool like dreamweaver
2012-11-03T21:15:00.000Z	gaetano	decbot	is wine a virtual machine?
2012-11-03T21:16:00.000Z	decbot	gaetano	so, in linux I use geany and vim to edit my html/css/javascript/php, use chrome and firefox to view the edits, and use gftp to upload the changes to my site
2012-11-03T21:17:00.000Z	decbot	gaetano	wine "Wine Is Not an Emulator" ... it is not a virtual machine, but an application that lets you run native windows binaries in linux
2012-11-03T21:19:00.000Z	gaetano	decbot	so with wine i can even run photoshop cs6?
2012-11-03T21:21:00.000Z	decbot	gaetano	winedb.org has the offical answers. I've ran Photoshop CS5.5 in wine, and I know Illustrator in CS5.5 will not run, but I havent tried dreamweaver
2012-11-03T21:22:00.000Z	gaetano	decbot	and where i find wine? on software center?
2012-11-03T21:22:00.000Z	decbot	gaetano	it should be there
2012-11-03T21:25:00.000Z	decbot	gaetano	check out winedg.org, it will have the answers and the best help on how to get CS6 running in linux
2012-11-03T21:26:00.000Z	gaetano	decbot	ok! thank u for help!
