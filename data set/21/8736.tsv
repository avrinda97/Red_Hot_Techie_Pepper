2006-06-16T10:46:00.000Z	leonassan		I'm sorry to ask again, but I think it might have gotten missed. I want to set up an FTP server on my Ubuntu install, how do I do that?
2006-06-16T10:47:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	but troy_s is right, better to use ssh. :)
2006-06-16T10:48:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	well, since it's your server, you can jsut tell the people to use sftp instead of ftp :)
2006-06-16T10:48:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	but anyway, if you really want ftp, just use any one of the ftp daemons. check out the list:
2006-06-16T10:49:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	i don't have an ftp server set up myself (ssh is good for me :) ), but i've heard that pure-ftpd is pretty decent. don't know if it has a gui though...
2006-06-16T10:52:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	gftp is just an ftp CLIENT, not server
2006-06-16T10:53:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	yes, it can be used for file transfer just as regular ftp. you just need to have an sftp-capable client.
2006-06-16T10:54:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	at least not if it's a USB1 drive :)
2006-06-16T10:54:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	heh, that explains it
2006-06-16T10:55:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	heh, that's some pretty heavy double duty there.
2006-06-16T10:58:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	are you running the synaptic package manager?
2006-06-16T10:58:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	did you enable the multiverse and universe repos?
2006-06-16T11:00:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	from menu, select settings>repositories (or something similar), and then check the universe and multiverse checkboxes
2006-06-16T11:00:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	or as an alternative, you can edit /etc/apt/sources.list file directly. (btw, just for the record, you running dapper or breezy?)
2006-06-16T11:02:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	ok. i'm doing breezy, so the exact menu options may be different for you.
2006-06-16T11:02:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	but anyway, so have you found the universe and multiverse checkboxes?
2006-06-16T11:03:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	cool :) hey, we all go through it at first. slowly the cluelessness dissolves away. somewhat. :)
2006-06-16T11:05:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	lamp is the std abbrev for "linux, apache, mysql, php" since its such a frequent server config
2006-06-16T11:06:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	ah. well, there should be some howto tutorials on the ubuntuforums, search for lamp.
2006-06-16T11:26:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	use command "id" to find out your uid and your gid and etc
2006-06-16T11:26:00.000Z	nanotube	leonassan	gid = group id :)
