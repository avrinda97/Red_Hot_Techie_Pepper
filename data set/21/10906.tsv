2005-04-10T05:54:00.000Z	black_nightmare		anyone?
2005-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	black_nightmare		someone want to explain this to me?? ....
2005-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	black_nightmare		Package acroread is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2005-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	black_nightmare		This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
2005-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	black_nightmare		is only available from another source
2005-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	black_nightmare		E: Package acroread has no installation candidate
2005-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	black_nightmare		*sighs*
2005-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	black_nightmare		airox..how do I do that in terminal now?
2005-04-10T05:56:00.000Z	black_nightmare		deb hoary universe is already uncommented (did that before for synaptic)
2005-04-10T05:57:00.000Z	black_nightmare		so any idea about apt-get not finding reader?
2005-04-10T05:58:00.000Z	topyli	black_nightmare	marillat has acroread 5
2005-04-10T06:00:00.000Z	topyli	black_nightmare	ESC, then :wq (to save & quit)
2005-04-10T06:01:00.000Z	topyli	black_nightmare	it goes hand in hand with the reader, so C. Marillat is the keeper of the plugin as well
2005-04-10T06:04:00.000Z	topyli	black_nightmare	you don't need xpdf in the menus. you rarely want to look at an empty xpdf :)
2005-04-10T06:16:00.000Z	topyli	black_nightmare	not sure. the update-notifier is a userspace program, it shouldn't be able to actually apt-get update
2005-04-10T06:17:00.000Z	topyli	black_nightmare	then again, there may be a system daemon on the background, and the notifier just queries that daemon
2005-04-10T06:20:00.000Z	topyli	black_nightmare	apt-get update still needs to be run as root
2005-04-10T06:21:00.000Z	topyli	black_nightmare	i'm just saying, the notifier can't do that because it's a user process. so there has to be a daemon with more privileges on the background
2005-04-10T06:23:00.000Z	topyli	black_nightmare	just install wajig and administer your box with a single command :)
2005-04-10T06:24:00.000Z	topyli	black_nightmare	hold on, i'll look up a link for you
2005-04-10T06:26:00.000Z	topyli	black_nightmare	here's a summary. it's a great summary. i wrote it myself. it's great. http://uclinux.info/wiki/index.php/Maintaining_a_Debian_box_with_Wajig
