2006-06-06T16:29:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		Guys, I'm thinking of running Dapper on VMWARE
2006-06-06T16:29:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		Should I?
2006-06-06T16:29:00.000Z	DarkLegacy		I've got a laptop with Dapper but the god damn ethernet connection doesn't work
2006-06-06T16:30:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DarkLegacy	well you'll need to look into compiling a kernel module for it
2006-06-06T16:31:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DarkLegacy	you sure the kernel doesn't recognise it?
2006-06-06T16:32:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DarkLegacy	have you tried experimenting with autonegotiate/speed/duplex setting with mii-tool?
2006-06-06T16:32:00.000Z	DarkLegacy	Frogzoo	no I haven't
2006-06-06T16:33:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DarkLegacy	'sudo apt-get install net-tools'
2006-06-06T16:39:00.000Z	DarkLegacy	Frogzoo	net-tools already installed
2006-06-06T16:40:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DarkLegacy	yup
2006-06-06T16:40:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DarkLegacy	damn, try 'sudo ethtool eth0'  (or whatever)
2006-06-06T16:42:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DarkLegacy	mii-tool
2006-06-06T16:43:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DarkLegacy	k, that sound right?
2006-06-06T16:44:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DarkLegacy	you just plug straight into the modem? no hub
2006-06-06T16:45:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DarkLegacy	& dhcp has worked from the router previously?
2006-06-06T16:46:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DarkLegacy	ok, so just to be sure try 'sudo dhclient eth0' again..
2006-06-06T16:47:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DarkLegacy	oh - first do 'sudo ifconfig eth0 up'
2006-06-06T16:47:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DarkLegacy	please pastebin /etc/network/interfaces
2006-06-06T16:48:00.000Z	DarkLegacy	Frogzoo	can't paste anything there's no internet connection on my laptop
2006-06-06T16:48:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DarkLegacy	ifconfig |grep eth0    gives?
2006-06-06T16:49:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DarkLegacy	& still 'sudo dhclient eth0'   no dice?
