2009-01-04T21:45:00.000Z	Akiva		Hello, I am looking for some help resizing my /root partition. I don't have enough room to update to 8.10. I tried using gparted via the 8.10 livecd but i could only shrink my /home partition. Even after this, when I had available space, I coudlnt figure out how to make / bigger
2009-01-04T21:45:00.000Z	Akiva		Any help would be greatly appreciated
2009-01-04T21:46:00.000Z	the_squircle	Akiva	you can't resize it while booted to it, try to do it from the LiveCD
2009-01-04T21:46:00.000Z	Akiva	the_squircle	I tried from the live cd
2009-01-04T21:46:00.000Z	the_squircle	Akiva	what error is it throwing when you try to shrink it?
2009-01-04T21:47:00.000Z	Akiva	the_squircle	I could shrink my /home partition without any problems and I applied it, which left me with available space.
2009-01-04T21:48:00.000Z	the_squircle	Akiva	Click 'n drag...
2009-01-04T21:48:00.000Z	the_squircle	Akiva	what program are you using to do your partitioning?
2009-01-04T21:49:00.000Z	the_squircle	Akiva	it doesn't
2009-01-04T21:49:00.000Z	the_squircle	Akiva	what filesystem is / using?
2009-01-04T21:50:00.000Z	the_squircle	Akiva	when you click on the partition and click grow/shrink... are you not able to drag it larger?
2009-01-04T21:51:00.000Z	Akiva	the_squircle	No, I cannot make it larger
2009-01-04T21:51:00.000Z	the_squircle	Akiva	does it show that there is the possibility to make it larger?
2009-01-04T21:52:00.000Z	Akiva	the_squircle	No, it doesn't. I have SDA1, which is my /root
2009-01-04T21:52:00.000Z	the_squircle	Akiva	nope....
2009-01-04T21:53:00.000Z	the_squircle	Akiva	it should show that there is some empty space (grey) on either side of the coloured (blue?) root partition... if there is no grey (empty space) adjacent to the partition, there is nowhere to expand to.
2009-01-04T21:55:00.000Z	Akiva	the_squircle	I don't know why there wouldn't be any space showing, though. I just shrunk my /home partition by 5 gigs
2009-01-04T21:56:00.000Z	the_squircle	Akiva	Did you click apply?
2009-01-04T21:56:00.000Z	the_squircle	Akiva	Can you provide a screenshot? it might be able to help. It's ok if you can't.
2009-01-04T21:57:00.000Z	Akiva	the_squircle	Perhaps I should retry with the LiveCD?
2009-01-04T21:58:00.000Z	the_squircle	Akiva	that should work.... I'm just re-installing GParted so I can take a look for you and give you some more help.
