2008-05-06T13:08:00.000Z	Ademan		anyone know of a mail checker applet for GNOME that works for any email service?
2008-05-06T13:08:00.000Z	Ademan		preferably one that works with epiphany
2008-05-06T13:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ademan	theres a tray service for thunderbird. not sure. erm...google have one too
2008-05-06T13:09:00.000Z	Ademan	ActionParsnip	thanks, yeah i'm sorta familiar with the thunderbird one, basically that only for epiphany... i'll look around, thanks
2008-05-06T13:12:00.000Z	Ademan	ActionParsnip	for the record it looks like there's a plugin for epiphany that will make it notify you of new mail, and if you set it to automatically check for new mail, it'll do so
2008-05-06T13:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ademan	im just throwing what i know out there. i dont use epiphany, sorry dude
2008-10-13T15:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ademan	its in kde though
2009-01-23T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ademan	i have it
2009-01-23T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ademan	my guess is its the random seed
2009-01-23T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ademan	no, the random seed starts at a random place in ram and just moves along, reading the data size for the requested number then moving along
2009-01-23T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ademan	thats how random numbers are made
2009-09-11T16:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ademan	the rock says..
2009-09-11T16:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ademan	+1million
2009-09-11T16:36:00.000Z	Ademan	ActionParsnip	haha, thanks, i immediately went on to call "irc" an application though :-p
2009-09-11T16:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ademan	irc is a protocol RFC 1459
2009-09-11T16:39:00.000Z	Ademan	ActionParsnip	yeah, i was pointing out my own mistake immediately after
2009-12-08T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ademan	its just an Ubuntu OS with a PAE enabled kernel and no desktop
2009-12-08T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ademan	you can install a virtual server like ESX or qemu as you wish from there
2009-12-08T16:09:00.000Z	Ademan	ActionParsnip	certainly, it's just there's a postgres user that postgres runs as, and www-data for web data (i don't remember if apache actually runs as that user or not) but my point is that if ubuntu has a user intended for running qemu or other virtualization software, i'd like to use it
2009-12-08T16:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ademan	not sure but you can certainly add yourself to groups to get access as well as make groups to then apply to stuff to give you access
2009-12-08T16:12:00.000Z	Ademan	ActionParsnip	yeah, i just didn't want to make a 'qemu' user if there was already a 'vmrunner' user or something, you know?
