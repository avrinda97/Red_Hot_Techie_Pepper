2010-03-04T05:54:00.000Z	Merritt		Hope someone has insight: Fresh install of Kubuntu 9.10, no sound at all. In KMix enabled all channels, none are muted and volume turned up. lspci reports Creative Labs CA0106 Soundblaster. Seems to be loaded fine. aplay -l gives nothing, Configure Desktop > Multimedia > Device > Test gives no sound either. Pulse audio is not installed (surprisingly was not by default), ran purge pulseaudio to be sure. Ideas? Thanks
2010-03-04T05:55:00.000Z	Younder	Merritt	check is sound is enabled for that user
2010-03-04T05:55:00.000Z	Merritt	Younder	I manually added user to the 'audio' group
2010-03-04T05:55:00.000Z	Younder	Merritt	then it should work
2010-03-04T05:56:00.000Z	Merritt	Younder	You'd think ;)
2010-03-04T05:56:00.000Z	Younder	Merritt	so there's a error. read it
2010-03-04T05:56:00.000Z	Merritt	Younder	Haven't gotten any sort of error so far
2010-03-04T05:57:00.000Z	Younder	Merritt	you wouldn't from a bach file. You need to type it in.

2010-03-04T06:09:00.000Z	Merritt	Younder	I've gone through the troubleshooting again, still no change.. one sound card reported, seems to be loaded, it is card0.. I am at a loss..
2010-03-04T06:11:00.000Z	Younder	Merritt	I am pretty sure  you missed System->Administration->Users and Groups)
2010-03-04T06:12:00.000Z	Younder	Merritt	you need to allow sound
2010-03-04T06:13:00.000Z	Merritt	Younder	Do you happen to know the equivilant in Kubuntu?
2010-03-04T06:13:00.000Z	Merritt	Younder	For managing groups and users
2010-03-04T06:14:00.000Z	Younder	Merritt	sorry no
2010-03-04T06:14:00.000Z	Merritt	Younder	k, i'll fiddle til I find out what the module is
2010-03-04T06:20:00.000Z	Merritt	Younder	Alright (apparently not installed by default >_>) . I double-checked, this user is a member of the group 'audio' and there is no group 'sound'
