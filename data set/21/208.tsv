2012-05-29T09:04:00.000Z	xclusive585		I didnt realize there was a Kernel 11.10
2012-05-29T09:05:00.000Z	xclusive585		I do I do
2012-05-29T09:05:00.000Z	xclusive585		hallow :-) it rocks if you can get it running. It's not user friendly as a headless server
2012-05-29T09:06:00.000Z	hallow	xclusive585	it works for the rest of my stuff but for some reason it freezes on one of my folders
2012-05-29T09:07:00.000Z	xclusive585		I had that issue. You most likely have a file in there that is slightly corrupt and ps3medaiserver's thumbnail generator freezes the program
2012-05-29T09:08:00.000Z	xclusive585	hallow	if you disable thumbnails, or previews, whatever it's called, it wont do that, otherwise you just need to figure out which file it is...
2012-05-29T09:08:00.000Z	hallow	xclusive585	ohhh yea that might be it because I downloaded a couple of torrents onto my HDD and I'm trying to stream the yu yu hakusho I just got
2012-05-29T09:09:00.000Z	hallow	xclusive585	yea I'm prob going to start eliminating files but if it's the actual video file then I'm fucked lol
2012-05-29T09:10:00.000Z	xclusive585		I've had video files that play fine, freeze up because of that thumbnail generator
2012-05-29T09:11:00.000Z	xclusive585	hallow	If you break the videos down into a few folders it will be easier to find out which one is broken.
2012-05-29T09:12:00.000Z	hallow	xclusive585	all of my movies/anime are in individual folders for each title (I'm a neat freak with that stuff) and I did disable the thumbnails but it still froze I think it might be my subtitles file or something
2012-05-29T09:12:00.000Z	hallow	xclusive585	is it possible that the fact that my torrent program is connected to the files currently could also be a problem or is that irrelevant
2012-05-29T09:12:00.000Z	hallow		?
2012-05-29T09:14:00.000Z	xclusive585	hallow	totally possible, but not probable
2012-05-29T09:15:00.000Z	hallow	xclusive585	ah
2012-05-29T09:15:00.000Z	xclusive585	hallow	most likely, there is simply one corrupt video file
2012-05-29T09:16:00.000Z	hallow	xclusive585	yea there is and it's in one of the episodes but I'm going to have to figure out another day because that's about 200 episodes I have to go through to find a potential corrupt video file lol I'm going to have to call it a night on this endeavor
2012-05-29T09:17:00.000Z	xclusive585		all in one folder! wow
2012-05-29T09:17:00.000Z	hallow	xclusive585	well yea because it was the yu yu hakusho collection so it downloaded all the sagas in one bulk I didn't get to organize them yet
2012-05-29T09:17:00.000Z	xclusive585	hallow	if you have a file browser that can produce thumbnails for you, that may give away the culprit easier
2012-05-29T09:19:00.000Z	hallow	xclusive585	true I'm just going to watch something else though I'll give it a run tomorrow thanks for everything I really appreciate it
