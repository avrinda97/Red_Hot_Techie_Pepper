2005-12-08T08:58:00.000Z	SockerFot	_jason	im trying to install Azureus bittorrent client wich i just downloaded
2005-12-08T08:59:00.000Z	_jason	SockerFot	it may be easier to follow the wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AzureusHowTo
2005-12-09T09:19:00.000Z	_jason	SockerFot	unrar-nonfree is the package name (ther is also unrar-free but doesn't open latest rar files)
2005-12-09T09:20:00.000Z	_jason	SockerFot	have you installed "unrar-nonfree" in synaptic/apt-get?
2005-12-09T09:20:00.000Z	SockerFot	_jason	now i have
2005-12-09T09:21:00.000Z	SockerFot	_jason	and now what the hell? it said there where no files to extract. LOL
2005-12-09T09:21:00.000Z	_jason	SockerFot	the syntax is "unrar x filename"
2005-12-09T09:21:00.000Z	_jason	SockerFot	if you wish you can use the archive manager (just double click on your file in nautilus)
2005-12-09T09:23:00.000Z	_jason	SockerFot	it's a closed format I believe
2005-12-09T09:23:00.000Z	SockerFot	_jason	wich means?
2005-12-09T09:23:00.000Z	_jason	SockerFot	doesn't have to do with costing anything
