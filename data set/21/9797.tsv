2006-08-20T12:43:00.000Z	blocky		is that if i fuck it up
2006-08-20T12:43:00.000Z	blocky		or is that a possibility either way
2006-08-20T12:43:00.000Z	blocky		btw its my home partition not the root
2006-08-20T12:44:00.000Z	blocky		my mistake
2006-08-20T12:44:00.000Z	blocky		i have a 250gb drive split into halves
2006-08-20T12:44:00.000Z	blocky		one for winxp and one for /home on reiserfs
2006-08-20T12:45:00.000Z	blocky		and i want to nuke the xp and give the whole drive to /home
2006-08-20T12:45:00.000Z	blocky		D:
2006-08-20T12:45:00.000Z	blocky		would it be safer to copy the whole thing to an xp box over SAMBA, reformat the drive, and copy it all back?
2006-08-20T12:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	blocky	 or check out the mondo/mindi backup/restore system
2006-08-20T12:48:00.000Z	blocky	dr_willis	would I have permission problems if i backed up and restored using an NTFS on XP over samba
2006-08-20T12:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	blocky	 i am betting yes.
2006-08-20T12:56:00.000Z	blocky	dr_willis	tar files will retain directory hierarchy and permissions, correct?
2006-08-20T12:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	blocky	 well for a ntfs partition - i dont think sp
2006-08-20T13:01:00.000Z	blocky	dr_willis	but can it do it over samba
2006-08-20T13:02:00.000Z	blocky	dr_willis	why is mondo better than tar?
2006-08-20T13:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	blocky	 its a  backup/restore system that is designed to do differnet things. :P depends on youyr needs
2006-08-20T13:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	blocky	 nuke to me implies DELETE - not backup
2012-01-27T07:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	blocky	kernel version. x version. driver versions... one or more
2012-05-04T08:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	blocky	 cant say ive noticed that.
