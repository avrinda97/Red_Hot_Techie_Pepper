2007-01-04T07:43:00.000Z	Spaghetti_Knife	bruenig	Decoding.
2007-01-04T07:43:00.000Z	bruenig	Spaghetti_Knife	copy that install-css.sh line
2007-01-04T07:43:00.000Z	bruenig	Spaghetti_Knife	it should install something
2007-01-04T07:43:00.000Z	Spaghetti_Knife	bruenig	How should it install something? It just names a file.
2007-01-04T07:44:00.000Z	bruenig	Spaghetti_Knife	just copy and paste it, it runs a script which installs it
2007-01-04T07:44:00.000Z	Spaghetti_Knife	bruenig	I even tried just typing that line, and it didn't work.
2007-01-04T07:44:00.000Z	bruenig	Spaghetti_Knife	put it in the terminal
2007-01-04T07:44:00.000Z	bruenig	Spaghetti_Knife	did you do the commands above that first?
2007-01-04T07:44:00.000Z	Spaghetti_Knife	bruenig	oh, it worked.
2007-01-04T07:44:00.000Z	Spaghetti_Knife	bruenig	Thanks. I just left out the "examples" part.
2007-01-04T07:45:00.000Z	Spaghetti_Knife	bruenig	Then it worked.

2007-01-04T07:45:00.000Z	Spaghetti_Knife	bruenig	Thanks.
