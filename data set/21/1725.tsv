2010-10-27T18:57:00.000Z	dlyneswork		Is linux 2.6.32 available for Jaunty?
2010-10-27T18:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dlyneswork	jaunty is EOL and not supported now dude
2010-10-27T18:58:00.000Z	dlyneswork	ActionParsnip	that doesn't mean that 2.6.32 wouldn't be available
2010-10-27T18:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dlyneswork	it will be hard to find debs for it as its not supported, you could compile the source or find somewhere with debs for the kernel
2010-10-27T18:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dlyneswork	due to it being EOL you will have a hard time finding stuff
2010-10-27T19:00:00.000Z	dlyneswork	ActionParsnip	theoretically 2.6.32 from 10.04 should work though, shouldn't it?  seeing as how it shouldn't be dependent on libc?
2010-10-27T19:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dlyneswork	if you want to try it you can but the Lucid kernel is compiled for Lucid
2010-10-27T19:01:00.000Z	dlyneswork	ActionParsnip	well, is there a switch for dpkg that will tell me about any dependencies?
2010-10-27T19:01:00.000Z	dlyneswork	ActionParsnip	9.1 and higher have other issues that currently prevent us from using them
2010-10-27T19:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dlyneswork	if you dont have the deps, the package will not install and the output wil tell you what is needed
2010-10-27T19:02:00.000Z	dlyneswork	ActionParsnip	and we don't have the time to fix those issues until another month down the road, or so
2010-10-27T19:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dlyneswork	theres this I just found: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
2010-10-27T19:02:00.000Z	dlyneswork	ActionParsnip	linux-image still includes the modules?
2010-10-27T19:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dlyneswork	should do yes
2010-10-27T19:03:00.000Z	dlyneswork	ActionParsnip	thanks
2010-10-27T19:03:00.000Z	dlyneswork	ActionParsnip	much appreciated
2010-10-27T19:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dlyneswork	what you are doing is not hugely advised and not supported so you are flying by the seat of you pants dude :)
2010-10-27T19:06:00.000Z	dlyneswork	ActionParsnip	yeah...just trying a quick fix for the time being on a test machine
2010-10-27T19:06:00.000Z	dlyneswork	ActionParsnip	if it works, we'll deploy it onto the cluster
2010-10-27T19:06:00.000Z	dlyneswork	ActionParsnip	otherwise, we'll have no choice but to try to get 10.04 working, i think...or maybe forgo this kernel altogether until a month down the road
2010-10-27T19:47:00.000Z	dlyneswork	ActionParsnip	Thanks...seems to have worked....needed to download the nvidia driver from their website, because the jaunty version didn't work with the upgraded kernel
