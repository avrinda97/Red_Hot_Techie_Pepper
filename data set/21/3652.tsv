2008-11-04T02:55:00.000Z	WIGGMPk		Does anyone have a recommendation on partition sizes for a 149.05GiB hard drive? I at least want a separate / (root), /home, Swap, and possibly /boot, /usr, /var, /tmp (but im not sure of the benifiets of the last 4
2008-11-04T02:56:00.000Z	cyr1	WIGGMPk	: what sort of machine is this for?
2008-11-04T02:56:00.000Z	cyr1	WIGGMPk	: if its for a workstation there's little use for partition subdivision

2008-11-04T02:57:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	cyr1	so this would only be beneficial in server use?
2008-11-04T02:58:00.000Z	cyr1	WIGGMPk	: typically, yea, for limiting the ability for multiusers to ddos by filling up root filesystem, etc
2008-11-04T02:59:00.000Z	cyr1	WIGGMPk	: personally for a workstation I see little benefit to multiple partitions (other than /boot and swap)
2008-11-04T02:59:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	cyr1	wow, how to do you DDoS a file system? do you have any literature on that off hand?
2008-11-04T02:59:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	cyr1	we
2008-11-04T02:59:00.000Z	cyr1	WIGGMPk	by, say, using dd on a filesystem with no quotas, etc
2008-11-04T03:00:00.000Z	cyr1		i.e create some huge files, and the system runs out of space, etc
2008-11-04T03:00:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	cyr1	well I have read that /boot being separate is no longer really needed because modern PC's can handle the larger disks, but I am very interested in separating the /home directory to make upgrading and disaster recovery easier
2008-11-04T03:00:00.000Z	cyr1	WIGGMPk	: that is actually ONE possible other one to seperate
2008-11-04T03:01:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	cyr1	wouldnt dd with no quotes be a matter of poor user privileges?
2008-11-04T03:01:00.000Z	cyr1	WIGGMPk	: obviously ;-)
2008-11-04T03:01:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	cyr1	I guess people would still want to be cautious.. makes sence
2008-11-04T03:01:00.000Z	cyr1	WIGGMPk	: but sometimes it's unintentional, say a high volume mail server
2008-11-04T03:02:00.000Z	cyr1	WIGGMPk	: you'd want a seperate /var partition (and preferably a seperate drive array) for something like that
2008-11-04T03:02:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	cyr1	i see
2008-11-04T03:03:00.000Z	cyr1	WIGGMPk	: for a workstation, i agree, /home is a good choice to make its own partition, and I'd probably give a good 60+% of the drive to it
2008-11-04T03:03:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	cyr1	thank you for your advice, I appreciate it
