2007-10-10T16:46:00.000Z	Twiinz		Hi there
2007-10-10T16:47:00.000Z	Twiinz		i'm setting up a linux server that will server an heterogeneous network of linux windows and mac clients, i wonder what that's best way to provide shared hard disk to this network
2007-10-10T16:49:00.000Z	Twiinz		samba support is somewhat dodgy in OSX though
2007-10-10T16:49:00.000Z	Twiinz		and the number of windows machine is very limited compared to the number of linux and OS X boxes, isn't there another option to smb ?
2007-10-10T16:50:00.000Z	rake|lurk	Twiinz	any os comes with FTP support, usually via a GUI even (even if nothing else than a browser - uploading via browser isn't as intuitive though)
2007-10-10T16:51:00.000Z	Twiinz	rake|lurk	unfortunatly OS X Finder doesnt upload files to FTP
2007-10-10T16:52:00.000Z	rake|lurk	Twiinz	so, pick the pain.  someone is going to have to go through some extra steps.  seems like OS X folks are hurting one way or another - I'd go with reliability over flakiness
2007-10-10T16:52:00.000Z	rake|lurk		and there's FTP clients available - and tell the users, this is the new file server browser.... lol
2007-10-10T16:53:00.000Z	Twiinz		ah well
2007-10-10T16:53:00.000Z	rake|lurk		sorry
2007-10-10T16:53:00.000Z	rake|lurk		we got linux, windows, os x at work too
2007-10-10T16:53:00.000Z	rake|lurk		heck, vista has to browse by IP
2007-10-10T16:53:00.000Z	rake|lurk		it's the worst
2007-10-10T16:53:00.000Z	Twiinz		ouch
2007-10-10T16:54:00.000Z	rake|lurk		aye
2007-10-10T16:54:00.000Z	Twiinz		maybe there's a way for setting up nfs for windows
2007-10-10T16:54:00.000Z	Twiinz		that'd be the absolute best
2007-10-10T16:54:00.000Z	rake|lurk		win svr?
2007-10-10T16:54:00.000Z	rake|lurk		pretty sure...
2007-10-10T16:54:00.000Z	Twiinz		win client
2007-10-10T16:55:00.000Z	rake|lurk	Twiinz	Yup!  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/324055  google to teh rescue
