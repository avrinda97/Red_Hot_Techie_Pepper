2011-08-09T08:58:00.000Z	meoblast001		so i broke APT?
2011-08-09T08:59:00.000Z	meoblast001		what full command?
2011-08-09T08:59:00.000Z	meoblast001		lsof /var/lib/dpkg/lock?
2011-08-09T08:59:00.000Z	meoblast001		that gave no output at all
2011-08-09T08:59:00.000Z	meoblast001		i already did
2011-08-09T08:59:00.000Z	meoblast001		oh, the command
2011-08-09T09:00:00.000Z	meoblast001		sudo apt-get purge mysql-client-5.1 mysql-client mysql-client-core-5.1 mysql-common mysql-server mysql-server-5.1 mysql-server-core-5.1
2011-08-09T09:00:00.000Z	meoblast001		i could put sudo apt-get * there
2011-08-09T09:00:00.000Z	meoblast001		anything involving apt-get will cause that
2011-08-09T09:00:00.000Z	meoblast001		<meoblast001> E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable) E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
2011-08-09T09:00:00.000Z	dsnyders	meoblast001	what about apt-get clean
2011-08-09T09:01:00.000Z	meoblast001	dsnyders	nope
2011-08-09T09:02:00.000Z	dsnyders	meoblast001	you don't have another package manager open. do you?
2011-08-09T09:03:00.000Z	meoblast001	dsnyders	no i do not
2011-08-09T09:04:00.000Z	dsnyders	meoblast001	you were sshing into a remote machine and running apt and the ssh connection broke?
2011-08-09T09:10:00.000Z	dsnyders	meoblast001	is apt working now?
2011-08-09T09:13:00.000Z	dsnyders	meoblast001	my man page for dpkg does not list a -l option.
2011-08-09T09:17:00.000Z	dsnyders	meoblast001	I think that that means mysql is up and running.  You need to configure it now.
2011-08-09T09:18:00.000Z	meoblast001	dsnyders	looks eerily similar to the cannot connect message it gives me every time i try to use the database
2011-08-09T09:22:00.000Z	dsnyders	meoblast001	I found mysql difficult to set up and use by itself.  I wound up using a web interface program called phpmysqladmin or some such thing.
2011-08-09T09:24:00.000Z	dsnyders	meoblast001	YOu may also wish to head over to the #mysql chat group to see what they have to say.
