2011-02-06T16:20:00.000Z	shooood		what does " Wrong architecture 'amd64'  " mean ????
2011-02-06T16:20:00.000Z	red2kic	shooood	It mean you need to use 32bit, I suppose.
2011-02-06T16:21:00.000Z	shooood	red2kic	: it appears when i tried to install skype
2011-02-06T16:22:00.000Z	red2kic	shooood	Run "uname -m" -- It'll tell you what machine you have. If you're on amd64, you may have to install lib32.
2011-02-06T16:29:00.000Z	shooood	red2kic	: does this lib 32 support skype ???
2011-02-06T16:30:00.000Z	red2kic	shooood	Afaik, there are no amd64 binary for skype, only i386.
