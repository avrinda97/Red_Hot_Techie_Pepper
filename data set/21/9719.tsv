2005-07-24T07:47:00.000Z	bojangles	axis^zzz	you better be sure to give them ubuntu for free ....especially if you include the AFPL licensed version of ghostscript because Aladdin does not mess around and if you make any money they legally have claims against you.
2005-07-24T07:47:00.000Z	bojangles	axis^zzz	the AFPL is not the GPL
2005-07-24T07:47:00.000Z	bojangles	axis^zzz	google "AFPL License"
2005-07-24T08:17:00.000Z	bojangles	axis^zzz	here axis...get informed and be aware of what you do....pay particular attention to any transfer of money associated with distribution of the program whether on the new computers you sell or on CDS...however you distribute it.
2005-07-24T08:18:00.000Z	bojangles	axis^zzz	and realize there are a variety of other similar type licenses in the open-source mixture...that is not pure GNU/GPL
2005-07-24T08:18:00.000Z	axis^zzz	bojangles	: but ubuntu is pure, ?
2005-07-24T08:19:00.000Z	axis^zzz	bojangles	I don't want to sell ubuntu, i want to sell computers. i'd sell them the computer for the same price even if they didn't want ubuntu on their system
2005-07-24T08:19:00.000Z	bojangles	axis^zzz	well ubuntu is not charging any money....but if they try ....lots of people will come after them...with valid legal rights to take away their money
2005-07-24T08:20:00.000Z	axis^zzz	bojangles	 so as long as i FULLY state my intentions, i should be clear.
2005-07-24T08:20:00.000Z	bojangles	axis^zzz	no..just don't try to make any money....then you won't be a target
2005-07-24T08:21:00.000Z	axis^zzz	bojangles	Well i doubt i'll make forbes top 10
