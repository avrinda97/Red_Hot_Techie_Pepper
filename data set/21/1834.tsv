2010-04-16T06:42:00.000Z	roark_	Losha	yes :)
2010-04-16T06:25:00.000Z	Losha	roark_	so you're saying you want the external drive to mirror the laptop?
2010-04-16T06:25:00.000Z	roark_	Losha	yes
2010-04-16T06:26:00.000Z	roark_	Losha	actually more than that when I delete somehting on my laptop it shouldn't be deleted on external HDD... since my laptop can store only 200GB but external hdd can store 1 TB....
2010-04-16T06:27:00.000Z	Losha	roark_	well rsync would be the first thing that comes to mind. But you should consider doing 'proper' backups to the hard drive instead of just accumulating stuff there with rsync...
2010-04-16T06:29:00.000Z	roark_	Losha	could you tell me what you meant by 'proper backups' ... i was thinking of rsyncing my home folder of my laptop to external hdd
2010-04-16T06:33:00.000Z	Losha	roark_	a proper backup means you can restore the state of the laptop *exactly* to how it was at a previous time. With your rsync scheme, you get a muddle of current and deleted files: it's ok for those 'whoops, I didn't mean to delete that file' moments, but it's doesn't support restoring full state...
2010-04-16T06:33:00.000Z	roark_	Losha	cool got it
2010-04-16T06:38:00.000Z	roark_	Losha	i always wanted to ask ... is !who case insensitive.. and can tab be any punctuation mark like . , : ;
2010-04-16T06:39:00.000Z	roark_	Losha	cant realy try bcos i dont know what happes on your end
2010-04-16T06:41:00.000Z	Losha	roark_	not sure what you're asking. tab is the tab key. It autocompletes names in most clients, in a client-specific way...
2010-04-16T06:41:00.000Z	roark_	Losha	oops dint know that
2010-04-16T06:42:00.000Z	roark_	Losha	awesome more productive
2010-04-16T06:42:00.000Z	Losha	roark_	saves a buttload of typing...
2010-04-16T07:04:00.000Z	Losha	roark_	I keep half a dozen files from /etc. I can recover almost all config from those few files. Parts of /home I can't live without get backed up when I remember...
2010-04-16T07:06:00.000Z	Losha	roark_	the reason people use rsync is because it can be configured to avoid copying files which haven't changed....
2010-04-16T07:06:00.000Z	roark_	Losha	cool then it makes lot of sense to stick with rsync...
2010-04-16T07:06:00.000Z	roark_	Losha	since changes in files are smaller than actual files themselves... i thought you meant the same thing
2010-04-16T07:07:00.000Z	Losha	roark_	the only thing better than rsync would be a proper full/incremental backup program...
2010-04-16T07:09:00.000Z	Losha	roark_	I can't remember if rsync will only transmit the changed blocks in a file, but it definitely knows to skip over files which have no changes...
2010-04-16T07:11:00.000Z	Losha	roark_	ah, here it is, from the man page: "...The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to transfer just the differences between two sets of files across the network connection, using an efficient checksum-search algorithm.."
