2010-09-01T16:09:00.000Z	jeepersz		I can't download all the dumb stuff it says because I don't have an internet connection to do it
2010-09-01T16:10:00.000Z	jeepersz		those programs don't work in windows
2010-09-01T16:10:00.000Z	jeepersz		I can't look at the website in ubuntu, either
2010-09-01T16:11:00.000Z	jeepersz		It looks like i have to compile drivers
2010-09-01T16:11:00.000Z	jeepersz		and identify my modem
2010-09-01T16:11:00.000Z	jeepersz		and blah blah blah
2010-09-01T16:12:00.000Z	jeepersz		I also didn't like the install. It was resizing my partitions before I even knew what it was up to. It could have said that was what I was agreeing to
2010-09-01T16:14:00.000Z	jeepersz		it's just retarded. I could use a real partition manager just fine, but it's dumbed down to the point of being obtuse
2010-09-01T16:15:00.000Z	jeepersz		and then grub wouldn't install. That failed. So now i have ubuntu on a partition I can't boot to, and if I do, dialup doesn't work
2010-09-01T16:15:00.000Z	jeepersz		yay, ubuntu!
2010-09-01T16:16:00.000Z	kpkarl	jeepersz	because Ubuntu is a separate operating system, it is not possible to install it inside your windows partition
2010-09-01T16:19:00.000Z	kpkarl	jeepersz	I'm sorry you're having trouble with Ubuntu, may I recommend you try installing inside a virtual machine next time
2010-09-01T16:22:00.000Z	kpkarl	jeepersz	how were you installing Ubuntu? via Wubi.exe or cd or usb?
2010-09-01T16:22:00.000Z	jeepersz	kpkarl	cd
2010-09-01T16:23:00.000Z	kpkarl	jeepersz	did you get an error message?
2010-09-01T16:23:00.000Z	jeepersz	kpkarl	Something vague about the grub pkg fialing to install
2010-09-01T16:25:00.000Z	kpkarl	jeepersz	ok, I see. well, I know there was a problem with 10.04 and grub that has sense been fixed. Other than that, I can't really say much
2010-09-01T16:29:00.000Z	jeepersz	kpkarl	So what am I supposed to do? try to install grub manually?
2010-09-01T16:30:00.000Z	kpkarl	jeepersz	you could. Do you want to try that?
2010-09-01T16:32:00.000Z	kpkarl	jeepersz	I can give you the command. Otherwise, to remove ubuntu you can delete the ubuntu partitions with gparted, then expand the windows partition, then use your windows CD to reinstall the windows bootloader
2010-09-01T16:35:00.000Z	kpkarl	jeepersz	to install grub run(using the cd): sudo grub-install /dev/sda
