2012-05-20T01:39:00.000Z	Conradzz		this is getting so annoying
2012-05-20T01:41:00.000Z	Conradzz		I swear...I'm about done with linux, this shit is getting old quick, I just removed/downgraded the majority of the updates I've done in the past 3 days
2012-05-20T01:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	drop the lagnauge
2012-05-20T01:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	if you're done with linux, that's fine, type /part and use what ever OS you want
2012-05-20T01:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	don't need to hear you swearing about it and complaining
2012-05-20T01:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	stop - no more language/name calling, stop it now
2012-05-20T01:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	I assure you people can
2012-05-20T01:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	doesn't mean others can't help
2012-05-20T01:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	really, so you think I don't help, no problem then
2012-05-20T01:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	I was just typing askgin you for info on your problem
2012-05-20T01:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	there is no-one in here who's job it is to get more people to use linux
2012-05-20T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	if you want help, just ask explaining your problem, and if someone can help, I'm sure they will
2012-05-20T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	no no, not every few seconds,
2012-05-20T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	just ask, wait - 10 - 15 minutes (if no-one responds) try again
2012-05-20T01:49:00.000Z	Conradzz	ikonia	how long have you used linux?
2012-05-20T01:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	that doesn't matter
2012-05-20T01:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	I'm not interested in detailing my CV to you, if you need help, ask the channel
2012-05-20T01:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	it's not closed minded, there is a channel of 1600 people , ask the question, someone will be able to help hopefully
2012-05-20T01:52:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	final chance - ask a question or be quiet
2012-05-20T01:52:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	if someone can and will help, they need to see the question
2012-05-20T01:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Conradzz	ok, you've asked the channel, if someone knows the answer/how to help and wants to they will respond
