2011-04-24T14:09:00.000Z	kaatta	syrinx_	emacs?
2011-04-24T14:08:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaatta	you could always use Emacs!
2011-04-24T14:09:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaatta	emacs.
2011-04-24T14:09:00.000Z	kaatta	syrinx_	emacs is...?
2011-04-24T14:10:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaatta	its hard to explain what emacs is
2011-04-24T14:10:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaatta	it's a pretty intense thing
2011-04-24T14:10:00.000Z	kaatta	syrinx_	oh emacs is an alternative for IDLE, ok... hmm, lubuntu have that available?
2011-04-24T14:10:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaatta	emacs is available for pretty much all Unix-based/like system
2011-04-24T14:11:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaatta	be warned, its NOT easy to use. easy to learn, extremely hard to master
2011-04-24T14:11:00.000Z	kaatta	syrinx_	thanks for the tip. would be a good idea then to get familiar with emacs if i intend to move into other programming languages after i get comfy in python
2011-04-24T14:13:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaatta	not exactly an IDE, but a text editor that does EVERYTHING. Someone even wrote an FPS in emacs
2011-04-24T14:13:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaatta	that is exactly the point, at its core, it's just a text editor
2011-04-24T14:13:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaatta	but you can do SO much in it that it is basically an OS
2011-04-24T14:13:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaatta	obviously, its not as easy to use as an IDE
2011-04-24T14:14:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaatta	worth learning though, because you can program pretty much anything with it, and it's considerably smaller than an IDE
2011-04-24T14:16:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaatta	you can even use it without a DE, ie, you can ssh into a box and use emacs to edit whatever you need to edit, ala vi
2011-04-24T14:17:00.000Z	kaatta	syrinx_	thank you, i will def be looking into it right away. appreciate the tip
2011-04-24T14:17:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaatta	all you have to do is "apt-get install emacs
2011-04-24T14:33:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaatta	3 hours!? for a half a gig?
2011-04-24T14:34:00.000Z	kaatta	syrinx_	i get like 800kbps speed on my work internet
2011-04-24T14:34:00.000Z	syrinx_	kaatta	ouch
