2004-11-15T12:20:00.000Z	BrittBS	jdub	this came up on ddl recently didn't it? (at least in reference to the bugreport)
2004-11-15T12:20:00.000Z	jdub	BrittBS	hrm, don't recall
2004-11-15T12:21:00.000Z	BrittBS	jdub	i thought elijah had been working on revisiting the task order stuff
2004-11-15T12:38:00.000Z	jdub	BrittBS	(yay! thanks)
2004-11-15T12:38:00.000Z	BrittBS	jdub	:)
2004-11-15T12:51:00.000Z	jdub	BrittBS	(EDITOR=nano visudo)
2004-11-15T12:52:00.000Z	BrittBS	jdub	ah cool! i didn't know that worked like that
2004-11-15T12:57:00.000Z	jdub	BrittBS	that's not really a bug, dude (and he's not connecting to localhost...)
2004-11-15T12:57:00.000Z	BrittBS	jdub	sorry wasn't really following convo ... and connecting to localhost running vncserver works properly, so shouldn't vino also?
2004-11-15T12:58:00.000Z	jdub	BrittBS	'properly'? :)
2004-11-15T12:58:00.000Z	BrittBS	jdub	non-spastically :)
2004-11-15T12:59:00.000Z	jdub	BrittBS	vino exports the current session, you can't connect to the current session on the current session and expect it to do something 'non-spastic' ;)
2004-11-15T12:59:00.000Z	BrittBS	jdub	report a sane error that you souldn't eb doing that
2004-11-15T12:59:00.000Z	jdub	BrittBS	similarly if you connect to a remote host and subsequently connect to the current session... ;)
2004-11-15T13:00:00.000Z	jdub	BrittBS	for localhost, that's doable
2004-11-15T13:00:00.000Z	jdub	BrittBS	although you can't tell which user's session you're connecting to
2004-11-15T13:02:00.000Z	BrittBS	jdub	can't because it hasn't been implemented in gnome-session or can't because it's not technically practical?
2004-11-15T13:02:00.000Z	jdub	BrittBS	the user's vino server would have to expose the username
2004-11-15T13:04:00.000Z	BrittBS	jdub	hmm. ok well i need to look at the vino details a bit more
2004-11-15T13:08:00.000Z	jdub	BrittBS	halting problem?
2004-11-15T13:10:00.000Z	jdub	BrittBS	oh. heh, totally missed it in context.
