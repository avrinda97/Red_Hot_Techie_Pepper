2008-07-06T14:40:00.000Z	fent		it keeps directing me to mozilla.com/firefox
2008-07-06T14:41:00.000Z	fent		i was trying to get ff3 for work here
2008-07-06T14:41:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	what version of ubuntu are you using
2008-07-06T14:41:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	8.04 ?
2008-07-06T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	firefox 3 is already installed
2008-07-06T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	for work ?
2008-07-06T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	you already have it
2008-07-06T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	it's already installeded "for work" ?
2008-07-06T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	so what OS is your work machine running ?
2008-07-06T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	so why is that anything to do with ubuntu ?
2008-07-06T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	why are you asking in an ubuntu support channel
2008-07-06T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	again - nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-07-06T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	you work for an ISP, there must be a lot of networking/internet support there
2008-07-06T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	and tools for diags
2008-07-06T14:44:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	your question and support request has nothing to do with ubuntu or the ubuntu support community.
2008-07-06T14:44:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	thats support
2008-07-06T14:44:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	and yes, I can get there
2008-07-06T14:44:00.000Z	ikonia	fent	perhaps find a better generic support channel for that sort of request in future
