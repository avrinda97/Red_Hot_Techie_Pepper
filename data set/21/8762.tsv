2006-01-16T06:24:00.000Z	_jacob		you know what you can do...you can try "apt-get install kscreensaver -s" see the deps on that and maybe see what you are missing
2006-01-16T06:24:00.000Z	_jacob		has anyone got bmpx to work?
2006-01-16T06:24:00.000Z	_jacob		i am really struggling

2006-01-16T06:25:00.000Z	_jacob		some libdbus crap
2006-01-16T06:25:00.000Z	_jacob		i don't think its libs i think its fonts
2006-01-16T06:26:00.000Z	_jacob		hmm
2006-01-16T06:27:00.000Z	_jacob		i think these guys are worth install...can't do harm i think...libqt3-mt  libarts1c2 libopenexr2c2 libpcre3 menu-xdg

2006-01-16T06:28:00.000Z	_jacob		so ANYONE bmpx ?!? i am desperate
2006-01-16T06:28:00.000Z	crimsun	_jacob	the deb linked from BMPx's wiki should work just fine
2006-01-16T06:29:00.000Z	crimsun	_jacob	what does it break on?
2006-01-16T06:30:00.000Z	crimsun	_jacob	it just needs to be recompiled against the newer libdbus-1-dev
2006-01-16T06:30:00.000Z	crimsun	_jacob	(and of course the corresponding libdbus-glib-1-dev)
2006-01-16T06:42:00.000Z	_jacob	crimsun	looking good so far...still making
2006-01-16T06:45:00.000Z	_jacob	crimsun	scan.c: In function `scan_devices':
2006-01-16T06:45:00.000Z	crimsun	_jacob	the api changed; it has to be updated. Did you check out trunk?
2006-01-16T06:47:00.000Z	_jacob	crimsun	any other ideas?
2006-01-16T06:47:00.000Z	crimsun	_jacob	I'm sorry, but I don't have to debug the compilation currently. I have a faculty meeting in a few minutes.
2006-01-16T06:48:00.000Z	crimsun	_jacob	I'll do a build after I return, ETA 2hrs.
2006-01-16T06:49:00.000Z	crimsun	_jacob	no, we're not going to have BMPx in Dapper.
