2006-12-26T09:09:00.000Z	SubMOA		btw, it's been years since I've been in a "chat-room" (it was AOL) and I must say, I've lost my touch for keeping up with all the chatter!!!
2006-12-26T09:11:00.000Z	SubMOA		still lots of info
2006-12-26T09:11:00.000Z	SubMOA		i just heard it was "dangerous" by the ubotu
2006-12-26T09:12:00.000Z	IdleOne	SubMOA	rpm may break your system as they arent made for ubuntu. ubuntu uses .deb
2006-12-26T09:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	SubMOA	 it's like using diesel in a unleaded fuel only car. it will run but it prolly will F everything up :)
2006-12-26T09:18:00.000Z	IdleOne	SubMOA	 it's really simple dont use rpm's on ubuntu
2007-03-15T16:20:00.000Z	IdleOne	SubMOA	not sure what you are compiling but in terminal just type make
2007-03-15T16:22:00.000Z	IdleOne	SubMOA	like I said I am not certain what it is you are compiling
2007-03-15T16:23:00.000Z	IdleOne	SubMOA	usualy it's ./configure make and then make install
2007-03-15T16:23:00.000Z	SubMOA	IdleOne	so i just typed "make" and it did some hoodoo voodoo, now "make install"
2007-03-15T16:25:00.000Z	IdleOne	SubMOA	is there not a readme file in the .gz file you downloaded?
2007-03-15T16:25:00.000Z	SubMOA	IdleOne	I'm an idiot... I'm sorry, RTFM, I know... I looked, but I must have glazed over it...
2007-03-15T16:26:00.000Z	SubMOA	IdleOne	turns out the readme is junk
2007-03-15T16:26:00.000Z	IdleOne	SubMOA	no no we dont use the RTFM in here . I was saying check the readme file because it should have instructions on installing
2007-03-15T16:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	SubMOA	yes sudo
2007-03-15T16:29:00.000Z	IdleOne	SubMOA	listen to cafuego sudo checkintall will make a .deb you can uninstall if need to later
