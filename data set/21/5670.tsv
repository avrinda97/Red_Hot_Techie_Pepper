2011-10-15T11:58:00.000Z	Strav		Can anyone try to reproduce the bug I'm talking about? (I'd wish to confirm it before reporting to launchpad if necessary)
2011-10-15T12:00:00.000Z	Strav		any channels for bug reports?
2011-10-15T12:02:00.000Z	phlak_user	Strav	 did you see if its already been reported?
2011-10-15T12:05:00.000Z	phlak_user	Strav	what might the bug be, pray tell?
2011-10-15T12:07:00.000Z	Strav	phlak_user	there's some kind of reset going on, my not sure of which part of unity, but this happens when switching between applications with alt-tab (it especially occurs when switching between a QT and gtk application but I also got the same problem when switching between google chrome and gnome-terminal so..)
2011-10-15T12:07:00.000Z	phlak_user	Strav	you mean like between skype and terminal?
2011-10-15T12:08:00.000Z	Strav	phlak_user	possibly yes.
2011-10-15T12:08:00.000Z	phlak_user	Strav	let me check
2011-10-15T12:08:00.000Z	Strav	phlak_user	let me try
2011-10-15T12:08:00.000Z	Strav	phlak_user	thanks
2011-10-15T12:09:00.000Z	Strav	phlak_user	I don't have the issue with skype
2011-10-15T12:11:00.000Z	Strav	phlak_user	same problem with vlc though (if you have it installed)
2011-10-15T12:12:00.000Z	phlak_user	Strav	ok
2011-10-15T12:13:00.000Z	phlak_user	Strav	ok it doesnt happen with Skype and any other gnome app
2011-10-15T12:13:00.000Z	phlak_user	Strav	let me see if i have vlc
2011-10-15T12:14:00.000Z	Strav	phlak_user	thanks :)
2011-10-15T12:23:00.000Z	Strav	phlak_user	any luck testing the switching between vlc and a gtk app (that is if your vlc is using QT)
2011-10-15T12:23:00.000Z	phlak_user	Strav	installing vlc now (after the upgrade, it vanished)
2011-10-15T12:24:00.000Z	Strav	phlak_user	ok... got a similar issue to when I upgraded to beta2, freakin perl-base had dependency problem, ended up removing half of my desktop
2011-10-15T12:27:00.000Z	phlak_user	Strav	tried with vlc too (but it has a gtk gui)
2011-10-15T12:29:00.000Z	Strav	phlak_user	you don't have any regular QT application beside of skype?
