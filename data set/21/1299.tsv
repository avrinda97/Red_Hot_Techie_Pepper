2010-11-08T14:09:00.000Z	frustro	dsf	look at s5 resume if you're looking for WOL.
2010-11-08T14:10:00.000Z	frustro	dsf	hibernate and suspend disables hardware to conserve power, that's it's nature.
2010-11-08T14:10:00.000Z	dsf	frustro	So there is no way?
2010-11-08T14:11:00.000Z	dsf	frustro	The way should turn on suspend/hibernate ?
2010-11-08T14:11:00.000Z	dsf	frustro	turn off.
2010-11-08T14:12:00.000Z	frustro	dsf	i forget which is which, but one takes the system into low power mode, disables all but cpu (on lowest clock and memory. the other takes RAM and creates file on HDD and powers off system
2010-11-08T14:12:00.000Z	frustro	dsf	are you trying to disable power management features so always on?
2010-11-08T14:13:00.000Z	dsf	frustro	I have this thing. In my workplace I have to work remotely into a virtual machine. So my computer stay opened all the time, but when it hibernates I lost the ssh connection and all my opened files will have to be reopened again.
2010-11-08T14:14:00.000Z	frustro	dsf	ur system goes into power management mode (PM for sort from now on) and you lose files?
2010-11-08T14:14:00.000Z	frustro	dsf	on remote server? how are u remote? SSH?
2010-11-08T14:15:00.000Z	dsf	frustro	I don't loose files. I loose the connection into those files. So when I reconnect I have to reopen the files again all over.
2010-11-08T14:19:00.000Z	frustro	dsf	 the remote server determins the timeout of the session is lost. just disable power management on the local machine.
2010-11-08T14:23:00.000Z	dsf	frustro	What is TSGateway?
2010-11-08T14:23:00.000Z	frustro	dsf	um, remote desktop to win box.
2010-11-08T14:24:00.000Z	dsf	frustro	gogeta1, How does it work?
2010-11-08T14:25:00.000Z	frustro	dsf	do you know if ur remote server disco is from power management on local box or inactivity?
2010-11-08T14:26:00.000Z	dsf	frustro	I don't know but why the remote server disco is important here? The problem is the hibernation of my personal computer.
2010-11-08T14:27:00.000Z	frustro	dsf	well, why waste all this time, go from ourt first resposne, turn off power mangement.
2010-11-08T14:28:00.000Z	dsf	frustro	Yeah. Think is the best way to. The screen option would be great. But for now maybe I'll pass. But the solution of install my own bin of screen or byobu will be tested. Thank you all.
