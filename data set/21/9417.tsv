2005-09-26T16:01:00.000Z	onkarshinde	kikisawaa	Must be somewhere in Applications->System Tools->Printing where you modify printing preferences.
2005-09-26T16:04:00.000Z	onkarshinde	kikisawaa	Did you find the Printing tool? Page setup can be found in properties of printer.
2005-09-26T16:05:00.000Z	onkarshinde	kikisawaa	Look Into Applications->System Tools or System->Preferences. You should find something related to printer.
2005-09-26T16:11:00.000Z	onkarshinde	kikisawaa	How about System->Administration?
2005-09-26T16:15:00.000Z	onkarshinde	kikisawaa	right click on the printer and select properties
2005-09-26T16:20:00.000Z	onkarshinde	kikisawaa	Have you configured the printer?
2005-09-26T16:22:00.000Z	onkarshinde	kikisawaa	which printer?
2005-09-26T16:24:00.000Z	onkarshinde	kikisawaa	I mean printer manufacture and model?
2005-09-26T16:24:00.000Z	kikisawaa	onkarshinde	kikisawaa: I mean printer manufacture and model?>>>> my printer is epson c45
2005-09-26T16:27:00.000Z	kikisawaa	onkarshinde	what should i do nxt?
2005-09-26T16:28:00.000Z	onkarshinde	kikisawaa	Have you configured your printer?
2005-09-26T16:33:00.000Z	onkarshinde	kikisawaa	Do you mean your printer is connected to server which has windows and you want to print from workstation which is on linux?
2005-09-26T16:35:00.000Z	kikisawaa	onkarshinde	kikisawaa: Do you mean your printer is connected to server which has windows and you want to print from workstation which is on linux? >>>>> yha if it do..???  but somehow i cnt still find the landscape.
2005-09-26T16:35:00.000Z	onkarshinde	kikisawaa	Are you currently able to print from linux box to the printer?
2005-09-26T16:38:00.000Z	onkarshinde	kikisawaa	Beyond my knowledge.
2005-09-26T16:41:00.000Z	onkarshinde	kikisawaa	I don't know hoe to share printers on networks.
2005-09-26T16:44:00.000Z	onkarshinde	kikisawaa	perhaps you are asking wrong question in wrong manner. So I can't understand your situation at all. Anyway, I have to go.
