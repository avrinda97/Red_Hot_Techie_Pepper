2012-05-07T23:21:00.000Z	kanapka		hi
2012-05-07T23:22:00.000Z	kanapka		who can help me set up flash for lubuntu? (if someone has the time?)
2012-05-07T23:23:00.000Z	Floyd42	kanapka	i think you can just install the "lubuntu-restricted-extras" package which includes flash
2012-05-07T23:24:00.000Z	kanapka	Floyd42	i've installed that, installed flashplugin-install too, I can see flash in plugins both in Firefox and chromium (enabled), but the videos don't work - i get a black screen on youtube
2012-05-07T23:25:00.000Z	Floyd42	kanapka	what sort of browser plugins do you have? specifically, noscript/flashblock kind .. those might be blocking flash
2012-05-07T23:25:00.000Z	kanapka	Floyd42	and chromium says 'missing plugin'
2012-05-07T23:27:00.000Z	kanapka	Floyd42	i don't have noscript or flashblock, only Icedtea, Windows Media Player, quick time and so, it's a pretty fresh install
2012-05-07T23:28:00.000Z	Floyd42	kanapka	windows media player?  i thought you were on ubuntu, or linux.  hmm .. i'm not sure about windows stuff.
2012-05-07T23:29:00.000Z	Floyd42	kanapka	but if you're using the dev version of chrome, try disabling the inbuilt pdf viewer, restart the browser, and try again.
2012-05-07T23:29:00.000Z	kanapka	Floyd42	it's called Gecko Media Player, it just says Windows media player on the top. sorry for the mistake
2012-05-07T23:31:00.000Z	kanapka	Floyd42	i've disabled everything except flash. do I need to restart chromium to test?
2012-05-07T23:31:00.000Z	Floyd42	kanapka	couple more suggestions. 1) remove all installed flash packages & reinstall it.  2) in firefox, install the add-on called "flash-aid" and restar the browser and try again.
2012-05-07T23:31:00.000Z	Floyd42	kanapka	yeah, try after restarting
2012-05-07T23:34:00.000Z	kanapka	Floyd42	still  says 'missing plugin'
2012-05-07T23:35:00.000Z	Floyd42	kanapka	sorry, i'm out of ideas. perhaps someone else can help you.
2012-05-07T23:35:00.000Z	kanapka	Floyd42	thanks for your time anyway :)
2012-05-07T23:35:00.000Z	Floyd42	kanapka	sure :)
2012-05-07T23:37:00.000Z	Floyd42	kanapka	if you're using chromium-browser, try downloading chrome from the website and installing it.  it comes preconfigured with flash, see ifthat works.
2012-05-07T23:37:00.000Z	kanapka	Floyd42	will try if flashdoctor fails
2012-05-07T23:55:00.000Z	kanapka	Floyd42	& MyJin: google chrome's flash works fine, thanks a lot for your help guys. for some reason I thought I can't get chrome for linux, only chromium
2012-05-07T23:55:00.000Z	Floyd42	kanapka	you're welcome.  glad it's working.
