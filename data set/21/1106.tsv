2011-08-01T21:35:00.000Z	gulzar	ThinkT510	but wth slow internet (cell phone).. I want to keep the softwares of ubuntu just the desktop to be changed.
2011-08-01T21:36:00.000Z	gulzar	ThinkT510	I went for Lxde in Debian and Knoppix and it performs BEST so want the same environment
2011-08-01T21:37:00.000Z	ThinkT510	gulzar	fair enough, i just thought having lubuntu would be more lightweight than having ubuntu + unity + lxde
2011-08-01T21:40:00.000Z	gulzar	ThinkT510	Sure. I have 1 GB of RAM with acceleration so no problem with Unity but I am interested in speed and ubuntu is installed on my external HDD for portability. I want Lxde so to use it on old PCs in College. But want to use Firefox Libreoffice and installing them on pure LXDE means lots of MBs which with my cell phone will take days to install so wanted to use LXDE. If problem persists them will PURGE unity. ;)
2011-08-01T21:41:00.000Z	ThinkT510	gulzar	good to see you have a plan, hope it works for you
2011-08-01T21:44:00.000Z	gulzar	ThinkT510	hope so. I make lots of plans like copying Arch from VB, installing Arch on pendrive, Using all envionments on Debian, and many more but This one should work.    Lets see what is the result. One more thing- In Knoppix Lxde+Compiz works like anything but here on Ubuntu it never....Not even on Debian +Lxde. with mint gnome some basic effects works. Why is it so?
2011-08-01T21:46:00.000Z	ThinkT510	gulzar	i'm more of an xfce guy, never been big on compiz so i couldn't tell you
2011-08-01T21:48:00.000Z	gulzar	ThinkT510	Ok. then is it possible to have nice look for apps like office. earlier I was using Xubuntu but Libreoffice looked like Windows95. I mean something like as gnome apps on KDE.similarly Gnome apps on Xfce?
2011-08-01T21:50:00.000Z	ThinkT510	gulzar	i see what you mean, it looks fine to me under my arch install though; prehaps it is a theme setting somewhere
2011-08-01T21:50:00.000Z	gulzar	ThinkT510	ok...
2011-08-01T21:51:00.000Z	gulzar	ThinkT510	Thank You!
2011-08-01T21:51:00.000Z	ThinkT510	gulzar	no worries :)
2011-08-01T22:52:00.000Z	ThinkT510	gulzar	if you don't want everything lubuntu-desktop drags in then you would have to select what you want bit by bit
2011-08-01T22:53:00.000Z	gulzar	ThinkT510	so is metapackage from USC do the same thing?
2011-08-01T22:54:00.000Z	ThinkT510	gulzar	try the lxde metapackage wols suggests
2011-08-01T22:59:00.000Z	ThinkT510	gulzar	sudo apt-get install lxde
2011-08-01T23:02:00.000Z	ThinkT510	gulzar	sudo apt-get install lxde
2011-08-01T23:03:00.000Z	ThinkT510	gulzar	sudo apt-get install lxde
2011-08-01T23:04:00.000Z	gulzar	ThinkT510	this is 12MB. Lets try this first.
2011-12-05T19:20:00.000Z	ThinkT510	gulzar	wxwidgits?
