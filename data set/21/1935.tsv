2010-07-13T01:05:00.000Z	rblst		hello; i have installed thunderbird 3 over my old thunderbird 2 profile; everything works okay, but there are two folders with the name of my two accounts that are empty and cannot be removed: http://img706.imageshack.us/i/thunderbird3.png/; can anyone help me  to remove them?
2010-07-13T01:06:00.000Z	zus	rblst	 try to rename them and then delete them? maybe
2010-07-13T01:06:00.000Z	rblst	zus	i'll try that
2010-07-13T01:08:00.000Z	zus	rblst	 you can also try in nautilus as root i think its sudo nautilus,...or something i've been useing kubuntu  so gnome is still fresh to me
2010-07-13T01:10:00.000Z	rblst	zus	i can not rename them
2010-07-13T01:11:00.000Z	zus	rblst	 try to then in "sudo nautilus" in the terminal it'll open  nautilus in root so make sure you want them gone for real
2010-07-13T01:12:00.000Z	rblst	zus	can you please take a look at the image, i want to get rid of the folders, not my acounts: http://img706.imageshack.us/i/thunderbird3.png/
2010-07-13T01:14:00.000Z	zus	rblst	  itll open nautilus with root privileges and you can navigate to the folder so you can delete them.... thats why i said make sure you want them gone.
2010-07-13T01:16:00.000Z	rblst	zus	okay, i'll check if they exist in the file hierarchy
2010-07-13T01:20:00.000Z	rblst	zus	i can't locate them in the .thunderbird directory, i think they were created inside thunderbird 3
2010-07-13T01:21:00.000Z	rblst	zus	maybe it is not possible to remove them :/
2010-07-13T01:23:00.000Z	zus	rblst	 it is, when you open nautilus  with root, just navigate to the folder you want as if normal....
2010-07-13T01:23:00.000Z	zus	rblst	 just be carefull as root
2010-07-13T01:24:00.000Z	rblst	zus	i think we misunderstand each other, these folders are "virtual" folders that corrspond to different files in the filesystem, have you looked at my screeenshot?
2010-07-13T01:26:00.000Z	zus	rblst	 i didnt realized they were virtual folders,
2010-07-13T01:26:00.000Z	zus	rblst	 they should be in your home folder still maybe under the hidden folders
2010-07-13T01:27:00.000Z	rblst	zus	thunderbird stores its stuff in ~/.thunderbird
2010-07-13T01:28:00.000Z	zus	rblst	 then open nautilus in root navigate to !/.thunderbird and look for the files ya may have to hit ctrl+H in each folder to see the hidden files....
2010-07-13T01:29:00.000Z	zus	rblst	 i had to find where my drive_c was in wine since some how i or the system must have put it in a different place.
2010-07-13T01:29:00.000Z	rblst	zus	i don't think you get my problem, but thanks anyway for being helpful
2010-07-13T01:29:00.000Z	zus	rblst	 :0 good luck
