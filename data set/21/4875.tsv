2008-08-02T07:57:00.000Z	rww		(the one that mentions pango, that is)
2008-08-02T07:57:00.000Z	RequinB4	rww	that's not the cleanest either, gdm is a package just like anything else, see above
2008-12-06T23:06:00.000Z	rww	RequinB4	what type of icons? The contents of ~/Desktop/ or the contents of your home folder, or stuff like "My Computer", "trash", etc.
2008-12-06T23:07:00.000Z	RequinB4	rww	~/Desktop/ Something I did about 3 months ago stopped it and now i can't turn it back on XD
2008-12-06T23:09:00.000Z	rww	RequinB4	take a look in ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs and check XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$HOME/Desktop"
2008-12-06T23:09:00.000Z	RequinB4	rww	that's not the issue
2008-12-06T23:10:00.000Z	rww	RequinB4	okay. Err, the related gconf-editor settings are /apps/nautilus/desktop and /apps/nautilus/preferences/desktop_is_home_dir. Might be others I've not seen before...
2008-12-06T23:11:00.000Z	rww	RequinB4	does your Desktop folder have a special desktop icon when you view it in Nautilus?
2008-12-06T23:11:00.000Z	RequinB4	rww	yes, which is why i think it's nautlius not drawing it
2008-12-06T23:12:00.000Z	RequinB4	rww	nothing is checkd in /apps/nautilus/desktop but that shouldn't matter
2008-12-06T23:12:00.000Z	rww	RequinB4	oh. Yeah, I've seen that before, but I can't remember why either. I'll mull it over and see if I can think of anything; in the meantime, I guess google =/
2008-12-06T23:13:00.000Z	RequinB4	rww	got it
2008-12-06T23:13:00.000Z	RequinB4	rww	/apps/nautilus/preferences/showdesktop
2008-12-06T23:13:00.000Z	RequinB4	rww	you'd think they'd have a more direct way of doing it
2008-12-06T23:14:00.000Z	rww	RequinB4	Oh, I see. Thanks :)
2008-12-17T02:20:00.000Z	rww	RequinB4	sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M, where sda is whatever your harddrive actually is, and 1M is the block size (and you can tinker with it to see what value of bs is fastest)
2008-12-17T02:26:00.000Z	RequinB4	rww	thanks, anyway to determine which bs is fastest or just guess?
2008-12-17T02:27:00.000Z	rww	RequinB4	There probably is, but I ended up just running 1K, 10K, 100K, 1M, 10M, 100M, etc., for about 20 seconds each and choosing the largest.
2008-12-17T02:27:00.000Z	rww	RequinB4	choosing the fastest **
2008-12-17T02:28:00.000Z	RequinB4	rww	aight, that's basically what i figured.  is the syntax exactly 10K, 1M, etc and not 1024 etc
2008-12-17T02:29:00.000Z	rww	RequinB4	i think either works. check the man page ;)
