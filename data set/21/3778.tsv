2009-01-12T00:20:00.000Z	strange		thats the problem ^
2009-01-12T00:20:00.000Z	ikonia	strange	what card is it ?
2009-01-12T00:22:00.000Z	strange	ikonia	trust speedshare pci

2010-04-30T13:03:00.000Z	ikonia	strange	how did you instrall the nvidia drivers ?
2010-04-30T13:03:00.000Z	strange	ikonia	downloaded the driver, killed gnome and ran it. i didnt download latest though but .15 the latest had a wrong kernel image with it
2010-04-30T13:03:00.000Z	ikonia	strange	why did you download the driver, and not use the official/supported restricted driver manager ?
2010-04-30T13:04:00.000Z	strange	ikonia	because the official restricted driver is old? this one works fine, the restricted drivers mess up the console resolution just the same
2010-04-30T13:04:00.000Z	ikonia	strange	as fasta said, the nvidia drivers are not controlled by the xorg drivers, they are frame buffers
2010-04-30T13:05:00.000Z	strange	ikonia	so i have to alter stuff in kernel ?
2010-04-30T13:05:00.000Z	ikonia	strange	just frame buffer config in your boot options
2010-04-30T13:06:00.000Z	strange	ikonia	do you have an url to where i can read up on it?
2010-04-30T13:06:00.000Z	ikonia	strange	no
2010-04-30T13:06:00.000Z	strange	ikonia	ok google here i come :)
2010-04-30T13:12:00.000Z	strange	ikonia	i found the framebuffer option where is menu.lst located with grub2 ?
2010-04-30T13:12:00.000Z	ikonia	strange	/etc/grub
2010-04-30T13:24:00.000Z	strange	ikonia	i had to edit grub.cfg setgfxpayload and now its all sorted
2010-04-30T13:24:00.000Z	ikonia	strange	nice job
