2006-01-12T06:36:00.000Z	bunghole		i don't need 3d acceleration really, if i just use the nv driver it should work correct?
2006-01-12T06:36:00.000Z	bunghole		i've always had to build the kernel module for nvidia myself in debian and modprobe it, or use module-assistant etc.
2006-01-12T06:37:00.000Z	bunghole		but this ubuntu is crappin my mind
2006-01-12T06:37:00.000Z	bunghole		no dice
2006-01-12T06:39:00.000Z	Sanne	bunghole	I also needed to install linux-restricted-modules-(kernel-version)-nvidia-legacy and linux-restricted-modules-(kernel-version) in addition to what the wiki said.
2006-01-12T06:41:00.000Z	bunghole		well i have to resort to using the nv drivers as apposed to nvidia
2006-01-12T06:41:00.000Z	bunghole		can i just build the kernel module myself and install it
2006-01-12T06:41:00.000Z	bunghole		?
2006-01-12T06:41:00.000Z	bunghole		the debian way?
2006-01-12T06:41:00.000Z	bunghole		or is that not recommended, because i've done everything the wiki said, but still nvidia module can't be found/loaded
