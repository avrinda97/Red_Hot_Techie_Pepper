2010-03-17T11:23:00.000Z	ranjan	rww	ya..thats what i suggested
2010-04-20T14:24:00.000Z	rww	ranjan	what do you think that command should do?
2010-04-20T14:25:00.000Z	ranjan	rww	the which command outputs the string ie the file path...and ln should count it
2010-04-20T14:25:00.000Z	ranjan	rww	isnt it??
2010-04-20T14:25:00.000Z	rww	ranjan	ln is used to making symlinks, not for counting things
2010-04-20T14:26:00.000Z	ranjan	rww	oh sorry my mistake....take the another thing.....
2010-04-20T14:26:00.000Z	ranjan	rww	which ssh | ldd
2010-04-20T14:26:00.000Z	ranjan	rww	why doesnt this work
2010-04-20T14:26:00.000Z	rww	ranjan	presumably because ldd is also not for counting things
2010-04-20T14:27:00.000Z	rww	ranjan	are you trying to print the shared module dependencies of the ssh program?
2010-04-20T14:27:00.000Z	ranjan	rww	no i know that...but the output  of which is not passed to ldd
2010-04-20T14:27:00.000Z	ranjan	rww	yes
2010-04-20T14:27:00.000Z	rww	ranjan	ldd `which ssh`
2010-04-20T14:27:00.000Z	ranjan	rww	i know that ldd /usr/bin/ssh will do
2010-04-20T14:28:00.000Z	ranjan	rww	llutz but why the way i said dont work??
2010-04-20T14:28:00.000Z	ranjan	rww	llutz whats the reason
2010-04-20T14:28:00.000Z	rww	ranjan	because | pipes the stdout of which to the stdin of ldd, which is entirely different from putting the output of which in the argument list of ldd
