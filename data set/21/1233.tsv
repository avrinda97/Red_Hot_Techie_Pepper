2010-12-16T04:00:00.000Z	noobie25		does anyone know if i have trouble with ubuntu dual screen...if i'll have any luck with kubuntu???
2010-12-16T04:01:00.000Z	grim__	noobie25	which graphics card do you use?
2010-12-16T04:01:00.000Z	grim__	noobie25	for me it was a bit tricky, but in general it works
2010-12-16T04:03:00.000Z	noobie25	grim__	 ati radeon 9600 [rv350]
2010-12-16T04:14:00.000Z	noobie25	grim__	 sorry i got disconnected ...  i dont have a radeon-kms.conf file...
2010-12-16T04:15:00.000Z	noobie25	grim__	 sorry, i got disconnected.... what initial problems were you having with you ati card?
2010-12-16T04:18:00.000Z	noobie25	grim__	  do you think you can help me with the ati driver?  i really like ubuntu's look and would like to continue using it.
2010-12-16T04:18:00.000Z	noobie25	grim__	 do you know if using kubuntu, i'll have better luck?
2010-12-16T04:19:00.000Z	grim__	noobie25	I'm running a ATI Radeon HD4750 and and 2 Monitors with different resolutions, I tried to configure dual monitor mode with the open ati driver but had no luck, so I changed to the proprietary driver from ATI and solved all problems, had some trouble to install but in the end everything was fine
2010-12-16T04:20:00.000Z	grim__	noobie25	I think it makes no difference using kubuntu
2010-12-16T04:20:00.000Z	noobie25	grim__	  i've been having trouble trying to proprietary ati install.... none of them lets me run.   how did you get it installed?"
2010-12-16T04:20:00.000Z	noobie25	grim__	 thanks...
2010-12-16T04:21:00.000Z	noobie25	grim__	  i'm going to try one last time with any of tq's suggestion to get the proprietary software installed....and then try another distro.
2010-12-16T04:21:00.000Z	grim__	noobie25	hm.. don't really know anymore, but the forums helped out
2010-12-16T04:21:00.000Z	noobie25	grim__	  which forum?
2010-12-16T04:21:00.000Z	grim__	noobie25	naaah that's not a distribution issue
2010-12-16T04:22:00.000Z	grim__	noobie25	ubuntu forums I guess, but there are a lot of other sites dealing with that problem
2010-12-16T04:22:00.000Z	noobie25	grim__	 is it the same problem i am having....where half the extended screen gets scrambled?
2010-12-16T04:23:00.000Z	grim__	noobie25	as I said I can't really remember, I'm running this configuration now for quite some time and never touched the configs again :D
2010-12-16T04:25:00.000Z	noobie25	grim__	 thank you ...i'll look for that posting
2010-12-16T04:25:00.000Z	grim__	noobie25	good luck
