2007-07-09T07:37:00.000Z	the_consul		I'm having a heck of a time getting cron to display a gui app...I've tried dozens of variations trying to set the DISPLAY variable and I still get nothing...What does the value 0 represent exactly?
2007-07-09T07:38:00.000Z	Pelo	the_consul	I use this line it might help 0 *     * * *   export DISPLAY=:0 && gdesklets restart
2007-07-09T07:39:00.000Z	the_consul	Pelo	I tried that exactly, except for the restart portiong...I just tried to open an app new, and I get nothing...
2007-07-09T07:39:00.000Z	Pelo	the_consul	 try with start maybe , restart is just for my own setup
2007-07-09T07:39:00.000Z	Pelo	the_consul	 "how" are you editing cron ?
2007-07-09T07:40:00.000Z	the_consul	Pelo	Tried adding restart and still nothing...sudo crontab -e....
2007-07-09T07:41:00.000Z	Pelo	the_consul	 is this an app that needs to run as root ?    like an antivirus ?  cause if not just do crontab -e to run it for the user
2007-07-09T07:41:00.000Z	Pelo	the_consul	 can I see the line ?
2007-07-09T07:44:00.000Z	Pelo	the_consul	I take it you don'T want deluge to run all the time ?
2007-07-09T07:44:00.000Z	the_consul	Pelo	nope, I'm on satellite connection and only have unlimited bandwidth for 3 hours late at night
2007-07-09T07:45:00.000Z	Pelo	the_consul	can you run  deluge  regularly ? I just mean to start it , because I haven'T been able to start it on my computer
2007-07-09T07:45:00.000Z	Pelo	the_consul	 you might consider using  utorrent on wine  it has a schedular in it
2007-07-09T07:46:00.000Z	the_consul	Pelo	yeah, I downloaded v0.5.2 earlier today and it works fine
2007-07-09T07:46:00.000Z	Pelo	the_consul	ok so first donT' run it as  root,   just use crontab -e not sudo crontab
2007-07-09T07:47:00.000Z	the_consul	Pelo	I'll give it a try without using root...
2007-07-09T07:48:00.000Z	Pelo	the_consul	 try this line in  crontab -e   41 *     * * *   export DISPLAY=:0 && deluge
2007-07-09T07:48:00.000Z	Pelo	the_consul	 the small amount of bandwidh is probably  dht and scrapping,  you might want to turn those off
2007-07-09T07:50:00.000Z	the_consul	Pelo	Man, I'm an idiot...I've been at this for hours...the non-sudo crontab did the trick...thanks a bunch for the help
2007-07-09T07:50:00.000Z	Pelo	the_consul	you're welcome , I take visa
2007-07-09T07:51:00.000Z	Pelo	the_consul	fyi  only use sudo crontab  for jobs that require root access
2007-07-09T07:51:00.000Z	the_consul	Pelo	Lesson learned
