2011-09-03T07:08:00.000Z	cab938_dt		I want to boot to a usb key, but I would prefer if the key was not fat32, suggestions?
2011-09-03T07:09:00.000Z	cab938_dt		The startup disk creator eats whatever is there and drops as fat32, so I get max 4gb files
2011-09-03T07:09:00.000Z	urlin2u	cab938_dt	boot what?
2011-09-03T07:09:00.000Z	cab938_dt		Just the 1104 startup disk
2011-09-03T07:10:00.000Z	cab938_dt		so I can have a casper environment and run from machine to machine with it
2011-09-03T07:10:00.000Z	cab938_dt		It's a 16gb key I'm using
2011-09-03T07:10:00.000Z	urlin2u	cab938_dt	do a full install.
2011-09-03T07:11:00.000Z	cab938_dt		So I did that, and first I partitioned the key into two disks, an ext3 and a ntfs, thinking "haha, I am so smart, now I can use part of the key in windows too"
2011-09-03T07:11:00.000Z	cab938_dt		but my laptop, which would boot from the startup disk created key, would not boot from this one
2011-09-03T07:11:00.000Z	cab938_dt		and windows had no idea what the key was
2011-09-03T07:11:00.000Z	cab938_dt		don't know if the arrangement of partitions mattered, the ext3 one was first
2011-09-03T07:11:00.000Z	urlin2u	cab938_dt	ypou put the ntfs at the front of the thumb.
2011-09-03T07:12:00.000Z	cab938_dt		I didn't, do I need to?
2011-09-03T07:12:00.000Z	cab938_dt		ubuntu can see them both, fwiw
2011-09-03T07:12:00.000Z	urlin2u	cab938_dt	yes and just do a full install the casper will fill up, and is pretty much impossible to clean.
2011-09-03T07:13:00.000Z	cab938_dt		urist, so ntfs in the first location, then a full install on the ntfs drive?  or onto the ext3 in the second partition?
2011-09-03T07:14:00.000Z	urlin2u	cab938_dt	ntfs first, ubuntu will only install to a ext type use ext4
2011-09-03T07:14:00.000Z	cab938_dt	urlin2u	ok, is there anything special i need to do to make sure i can boot from the ext part?  I don't understand why the laptop won't boot from it right now
2011-09-03T07:17:00.000Z	urlin2u	cab938_dt	you have to install the grub bootloader to  the thumb, use the something else option in the install where asked where the install goes, there is a dropdown there to choose where grub goes, to the thumbs mbnr which has no partition numbers for example sdb.
2011-09-03T07:17:00.000Z	urlin2u		mbr
2011-09-03T07:17:00.000Z	cab938_dt	urlin2u	ok, I'll give it a wing
