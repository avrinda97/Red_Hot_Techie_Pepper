2005-07-10T08:49:00.000Z	adamh		Has anyone here installed ubuntu on a flash drive?
2005-07-10T08:49:00.000Z	jmjones	adamh	hee hee - actually, the latest ati driver on ati's website is *almost* usable.
2005-07-10T08:49:00.000Z	jmjones	adamh	thought about it...never tried
2005-07-10T08:49:00.000Z	adamh	jmjones	As long as ATI's drivers crash when I resume from suspend, I'm sticking with the free ones :)
2005-07-10T08:50:00.000Z	jmjones	adamh	i can't get anything to come back from suspend - fglrx or the plain ati ones
2005-07-10T08:50:00.000Z	adamh	jmjones	The plain ones work fine for me :)
2005-07-10T08:50:00.000Z	jmjones	adamh	what vidio card you got
2005-07-10T08:51:00.000Z	adamh	jmjones	Radeon Mobility 9000
2005-07-10T08:51:00.000Z	adamh	jmjones	Have you played with /etc/default/acpi-support? :)
2005-07-10T08:51:00.000Z	jmjones	adamh	 what driver are you using?
2005-07-10T08:51:00.000Z	adamh	jmjones	Whichever one Ubuntu auto-detects :)
2005-07-10T08:51:00.000Z	adamh	jmjones	I've got ACPI_SLEEP_MODE=mem, SAVE_VBE_STATE=true, USE_DPMS=true, and that's it
2005-07-10T08:52:00.000Z	jmjones	adamh	do glxinfo | more
2005-07-10T08:52:00.000Z	jmjones	adamh	did you hack that or is that how it came?
2005-07-10T08:52:00.000Z	adamh	jmjones	I hacked it to enable ACPI_SLEEP_MODE=mem, it didn't come that way. Not sure about the rest
2005-07-10T08:52:00.000Z	adamh	jmjones	But in general, for me, Hoary Just Worked :)
2005-07-10T08:53:00.000Z	jmjones	adamh	i've hacked on a bunch of acpi stuff and can't get it working right.....
2005-07-10T08:53:00.000Z	adamh	jmjones	I didn't touch any of that. (My laptop is a Dell Inspiron 600m, btw)
2005-07-10T08:53:00.000Z	jmjones	adamh	i've got the inspiron 9300
2005-07-10T08:54:00.000Z	jmjones	adamh	i'll carry on hacking....
