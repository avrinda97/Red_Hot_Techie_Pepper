2010-06-02T05:40:00.000Z	RegressLess	minimec	that last link referred to a Master bug report. can you help me decipher what it's telling me to do?
2010-06-02T05:45:00.000Z	minimec	RegressLess	I am just reading through follow the Bug thread from #35 on. They are trying different things with /etc/xorg.conf and disabeling kms
2010-06-02T05:47:00.000Z	RegressLess	minimec	this is all over my head. I tried the patch mentioned at the top and the repository no longer exists.
2010-06-02T05:48:00.000Z	minimec	RegressLess	That is a clean install right? I would step back to jaunty 9.04. There seem to be a lot of problems with intel drivers and the newer xservers...
2010-06-02T05:49:00.000Z	minimec	RegressLess	Means... Do a new clean jaunty install.
2010-06-02T05:49:00.000Z	RegressLess	minimec	is there an easy way to "step back"?
2010-06-02T05:49:00.000Z	RegressLess	minimec	make a jaunty cd and start fresh?
2010-06-02T05:49:00.000Z	minimec	RegressLess	No. You need to install a new clean jaunty
2010-06-02T05:49:00.000Z	minimec	RegressLess	Yes,
2010-06-02T05:50:00.000Z	RegressLess	minimec	windows 7 bootleg it is
2010-06-02T05:51:00.000Z	minimec	RegressLess	Hmmm... I don't have much wxperience with dual boot, and no experience with win7
2010-06-02T05:52:00.000Z	RegressLess	minimec	I'm just saying that I have a copy of win7 here as a last option and since I want to go home, get laid, and go to bed, I'm going that route. I don't have all night.
2010-06-02T05:52:00.000Z	minimec	RegressLess	OK ;)
