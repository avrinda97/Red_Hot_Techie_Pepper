2005-07-08T07:52:00.000Z	AlexBO		I've searched for more of one hour in the web, but I've not find anythings.
2005-07-08T07:52:00.000Z	penguin42	AlexBO	parallel port scanners are evil magic
2005-07-08T07:53:00.000Z	AlexBO	penguin42	what is "evil magic"?
2005-07-08T07:53:00.000Z	penguin42	AlexBO	Well, normally pretty hard to get to work reliably
2005-07-08T07:57:00.000Z	penguin42	AlexBO	Which package is it that is part of?
2005-07-08T07:59:00.000Z	AlexBO	penguin42	i've download the packages from the SANE site
2005-07-08T08:00:00.000Z	penguin42	AlexBO	Oh - why? Ubuntu has sane, and it seems to have the umax_pp driver in
2005-07-08T08:02:00.000Z	AlexBO	penguin42	i've tried to start X-Sane, but it doen't find a scanner
2005-07-08T08:03:00.000Z	penguin42	AlexBO	Which Umax model did you say it was?
2005-07-08T08:04:00.000Z	AlexBO	penguin42	UMAX Astra Scanner 1220P
2005-07-08T08:04:00.000Z	penguin42	AlexBO	Hmm right, that should work - ok, it might be a permission thing, it definitely says oyu might need to be root to get to the parallel port
2005-07-08T08:08:00.000Z	AlexBO	penguin42	[umax_pp_low]  sanei_umax_pp_InitPort cannot use direct hardware access
2005-07-08T08:09:00.000Z	penguin42	AlexBO	Do you have a /dev/parport0 ?
2005-07-08T08:10:00.000Z	AlexBO	penguin42	how i can see it?
2005-07-08T08:10:00.000Z	penguin42	AlexBO	ls -l /dev/parport0
2005-07-08T08:10:00.000Z	AlexBO	penguin42	no such files or directories
2005-07-08T08:11:00.000Z	penguin42	AlexBO	Hmm - neither do I - I wonder how we educate ubuntu about parallel ports?
2005-07-08T08:11:00.000Z	AlexBO	penguin42	well, i don't know...
2005-07-08T08:12:00.000Z	penguin42	AlexBO	Hmm - let me have a dig - unless anyone else knows the magic?
2005-07-08T08:13:00.000Z	penguin42	AlexBO	I think the first thing is to get Ubuntu to see parallel por t- until then you aren't going to get very far :-)
2005-07-08T08:14:00.000Z	AlexBO	penguin42	okey, how i can make it?
