2009-06-19T04:57:00.000Z	reya276		Can anyone tell me what is the path to edit hard drive entries something like fstat or something
2009-06-19T04:58:00.000Z	edbian	reya276	Hard drive entries???
2009-06-19T04:58:00.000Z	edbian	reya276	Do you mean /etc/fstab?
2009-06-19T04:58:00.000Z	reya276	edbian	yes, thank you
2009-06-19T05:01:00.000Z	reya276	edbian	how can I apply permissions of 777 to a removeable drive such as a WD My Book?
2009-06-19T05:02:00.000Z	reya276	edbian	I tried doing chmod 777 /media/My Book, but that did not work
2009-07-08T03:34:00.000Z	edbian	reya276	Not directly I don't think.
2009-07-08T03:35:00.000Z	reya276	edbian	Ok so can I upgrade 7.10 to 8.04 or 8.10?
2009-07-08T03:35:00.000Z	edbian	reya276	That you can definitely do.
2009-07-08T03:35:00.000Z	reya276	edbian	ok so I can do 7.10 to 8.10
2009-07-08T03:36:00.000Z	edbian	reya276	no.  You have to go one at a time.  7.10 to 8.04 to 8.10 to 9.04
2009-07-08T03:36:00.000Z	edbian	reya276	The only except is LTS to LTS (8.04 to whatever the next one will be)
2009-07-08T03:36:00.000Z	edbian	reya276	Do you have data that you don't want to lose on the ubuntu install?  It is probably easier to just get a 9.04 disk and reinstall the O.S. if not.
2009-07-08T03:37:00.000Z	reya276	edbian	right I was thinking of that but not an option right now
2009-07-08T03:38:00.000Z	reya276	edbian	I have some data but I can always backup MYSQL and tranfer that to my PC here
2009-07-08T03:38:00.000Z	edbian	reya276	You could (if you have room) make a new partition that will become your /home.  Copy all of you /home onto the new partition and install 9.04 over the old partition mounting the new /home.  Does that make sense?
2009-07-08T03:39:00.000Z	edbian	reya276	It is risky doing it remotely :)
2009-07-08T03:39:00.000Z	reya276	edbian	yeah you have a point
2009-07-08T03:39:00.000Z	reya276	edbian	k I wont go there, I guess it will have to wait.
2009-07-08T03:39:00.000Z	reya276	edbian	thanks
2009-07-08T03:39:00.000Z	edbian	reya276	NP!
