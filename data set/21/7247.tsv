2006-12-09T12:27:00.000Z	elfreakz	nolimitsoya	thanks for the ext2 ifs for windows link :)
2006-12-09T12:29:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	elfreakz	you can use ext2/3 as any other partition
2006-12-09T12:29:00.000Z	elfreakz	nolimitsoya	so if i wanted to move files from xp to ubuntu partition, so i need to go to fat32 partition first, or i can directly move and copy it between 2 ext3 partition?
2006-12-09T12:29:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	elfreakz	you can use ext2/3 as any other partition
2006-12-09T12:30:00.000Z	elfreakz	nolimitsoya	that will sure no data corrupted?
2006-12-09T12:30:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	elfreakz	its reasonably safe
2006-12-09T12:30:00.000Z	elfreakz	nolimitsoya	thanks :)
2006-12-09T12:31:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	elfreakz	unlike ntfs, ext is very well documented and open source, so its easy toprogram drivers for
2006-12-09T12:32:00.000Z	elfreakz	nolimitsoya	but my XP partition is already NTFS... so i cant copy/move files from ubuntu ext3 to XP or vise versa?
2006-12-09T12:32:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	elfreakz	hasnt this been clarified a number of times? ntfs writing from linux is dangerous, and ext3 acces from windows is perfectly fine
2006-12-09T12:33:00.000Z	elfreakz	nolimitsoya	so if i use xp, i can get ubuntu file.. but NO/DONT when i use ubuntu to get something from XP NTFS.. am i right?
2006-12-09T12:34:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	elfreakz	its perfectly simple realy, and i cant explain it better than has already been explained. jori, such tabels are ogus
