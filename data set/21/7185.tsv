2006-11-17T12:21:00.000Z	psycode		anyone know the commands i can use to configure default gateway / dns name servers?
2006-11-17T12:23:00.000Z	Crayden	psycode	If you're not comfortable with the 'Networking' utilitt from the system menu, try editing /etc/resolv.conf for DNS, and 'route' for adding/removing gateways (ie. 'route add default gw 10.0.0.1' will make 10.0.0.1 your default gateway)
2006-11-17T12:24:00.000Z	Crayden	psycode	just plain 'route' shows the routing table, and you can also use 'ifconfig' (ie. ifconfig eth0) to view and edit IP settings for the ethernet card
2006-11-17T12:24:00.000Z	psycode	Crayden	warkruid, thanks i'll try that...
2006-11-17T12:25:00.000Z	psycode	Crayden	am i supposed to "reset" my networking or something to make changes apply?
2006-11-17T12:26:00.000Z	Crayden	psycode	No need for that, no
2006-11-17T12:26:00.000Z	Crayden	psycode	..of course, you need to be root to do anything with that stuff.
2006-11-17T12:26:00.000Z	psycode	Crayden	yes i'm aware to that ;)
2006-11-17T12:28:00.000Z	psycode	Crayden	are you sure no software reset is needed? like in windows i would do "renew ip"
2006-11-17T12:29:00.000Z	Crayden	psycode	Changing the routing table, editing the resolv.conf for DNS and changing the IP address of the network card - none of these need a restart/reset
2006-11-17T12:30:00.000Z	Crayden	psycode	If you're having problems, maybe there's another route setting that's conflicting with the one you just set.  If you want to change your IP you just have to do 'ifconfig eth0 up 10.0.0.100' to get that ip, and that's it
2006-11-17T12:31:00.000Z	psycode	Crayden	no it's not that, it seems like a dns issue since directly targeting google's ip answers to ping
2006-11-17T12:33:00.000Z	Crayden	psycode	but pinging google.com instead of the ip doesn't work...  Does 'cat /etc/resolv.conf' spit out the right DNS servers?
2006-11-17T12:33:00.000Z	psycode	Crayden	yes and yes... i know it's odd :P
2006-11-17T12:33:00.000Z	Crayden	psycode	there should be single lines, each reading "nameserver 123.123.123.124'
2006-11-17T12:33:00.000Z	Crayden		hmh :/
2006-11-17T12:33:00.000Z	psycode	Crayden	yup
2006-11-17T12:33:00.000Z	Crayden	psycode	And you get a ping reply from the DNS servers?
2006-11-17T12:34:00.000Z	psycode	Crayden	yes..
2006-11-17T12:34:00.000Z	psycode	Crayden	ha! google.com answers now :) thanks for the help :)
2006-11-17T12:34:00.000Z	Crayden	psycode	Yay :o)
