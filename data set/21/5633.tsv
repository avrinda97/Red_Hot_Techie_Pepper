2007-09-15T16:59:00.000Z	BernieMac		how can I check the size of my swap partition?
2007-09-15T05:00:00.000Z	rafaelscj	BernieMac	system _ admin > system monitor
2007-09-15T05:02:00.000Z	BernieMac	rafaelscj	thanks, it says that I'm using 0 of 376.5MB, does that actually mean that I have only 365.5mb in my swap partition??
2007-09-15T05:02:00.000Z	rafaelscj	BernieMac	yes
2007-09-15T05:03:00.000Z	BernieMac	rafaelscj	thats outrageously small isn't it? I did the auto install so ubuntu chose the size
2007-09-15T05:03:00.000Z	rafaelscj	BernieMac	how much RAM do you have?
2007-09-15T05:04:00.000Z	BernieMac	rafaelscj	1 gig
2007-09-15T05:04:00.000Z	rafaelscj	BernieMac	376,5 is more then enough
2007-09-15T05:07:00.000Z	BernieMac	rafaelscj	I am using 464.4Mb out of 1002.4MB of memory and 0mb out of 376.5Mb of swap
2007-09-15T05:08:00.000Z	rafaelscj	BernieMac	you only need to have more swap if you want to use hybernate
2007-09-15T05:09:00.000Z	BernieMac	rafaelscj	ok thanks! I'm pretty new to linux, I've only been playing for about a week now
2007-09-15T05:09:00.000Z	rafaelscj	BernieMac	enjoy it :)
2007-09-15T05:10:00.000Z	BernieMac	rafaelscj	thanks! I am so far, I find myself spending less and less time in windows as the days pass
2007-09-15T05:22:00.000Z	rafaelscj	BernieMac	sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-09-15T05:22:00.000Z	BernieMac	rafaelscj	thanks!
2007-09-16T16:50:00.000Z	BernieMac	rafaelscj	you aren't running desktop effects are you?
2007-09-16T16:51:00.000Z	rafaelscj	BernieMac	is that the cause?
2007-09-16T16:52:00.000Z	BernieMac	rafaelscj	could be, mine gets finicky with effects on, only vlc will run and I have to have it full screened on its own desktop and switch between then and another quickly for video to run
2007-09-16T16:52:00.000Z	BernieMac	rafaelscj	I've heard other people have had the issue of audio and no video with effects on too
2007-09-16T16:53:00.000Z	rafaelscj	BernieMac	you're right, I got, thanks
2007-09-16T16:53:00.000Z	BernieMac	rafaelscj	no prob
