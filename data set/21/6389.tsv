2008-08-10T17:36:00.000Z	drazak	DozedOnLinux	that's a root dns server
2008-08-10T17:36:00.000Z	drazak	DozedOnLinux	it's the NA root dns server
2008-08-10T17:41:00.000Z	drazak	DozedOnLinux	wrong
2008-08-10T17:41:00.000Z	drazak	DozedOnLinux	internic
2008-08-10T17:41:00.000Z	drazak	DozedOnLinux	level3 owns the ip
2008-08-10T17:42:00.000Z	drazak	DozedOnLinux	whomever owns the ip doesn't necessarily mean who owns the server :P
2008-08-10T17:42:00.000Z	drazak	DozedOnLinux	that's actually a multihomed ip address, so level3 is just one of the paths
2008-08-10T17:42:00.000Z	drazak	DozedOnLinux	not saying you don't :P
2008-08-10T17:44:00.000Z	drazak	DozedOnLinux	it lets him use dns for now
2008-08-10T17:45:00.000Z	drazak	DozedOnLinux	heh, not what I was saying, but sure
2008-08-10T17:46:00.000Z	drazak	DozedOnLinux	4.2.2.1 the rootdns server is multihomed on level3 and other tier2 internet connections
