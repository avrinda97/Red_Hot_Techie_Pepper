2006-11-02T14:27:00.000Z	flasher		or do i always have to type in the gdm restart command, savvas, nothlit
2006-11-02T14:27:00.000Z	flasher		?
2006-11-02T14:27:00.000Z	savvas	flasher	you can reboot, yes
2006-11-02T14:27:00.000Z	flasher	savvas	thanks so much!!!
2006-11-02T14:28:00.000Z	savvas	flasher	one hint though
2006-11-02T14:28:00.000Z	flasher	savvas	yes?
2006-11-02T14:29:00.000Z	savvas	flasher	when you have to upgrade your distro again, use the dist-upgrade, and then sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop and sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2006-11-02T14:29:00.000Z	flasher	savvas	ok. i hope  i remember that.
2006-11-02T14:30:00.000Z	flasher	savvas	because what i did was this: 1) in sources.list, replace the word dapper with edgy. 2) apt-get update 3)apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-11-02T14:30:00.000Z	flasher	savvas	are these 3 steps insufficient?
2006-11-02T14:32:00.000Z	savvas	flasher	normally the update-manager should help you upgrading your distro: gksu "update-manager -c"
2006-11-02T14:32:00.000Z	flasher	savvas	yes, but for xubuntu people, they said update-manager had a problem, so that's why i didn't use it.
2006-11-02T14:33:00.000Z	savvas	flasher	oh ok, well the howto for edgy updates is here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades#head-d8c4cd1dd987e54723fef2760b37f9279487551f
2006-11-02T14:33:00.000Z	savvas	flasher	sorry, i meant upgrade to edgy :)
2006-11-02T14:35:00.000Z	flasher	savvas	thanks once again for helping a xubuntu cousin! 8-)
2006-11-02T14:35:00.000Z	savvas	flasher	n/p :)
2006-11-02T14:36:00.000Z	savvas	flasher	just keep it open-source :P
2006-11-02T14:36:00.000Z	flasher	savvas	yes sir! 8-]
