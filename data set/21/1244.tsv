2010-12-27T17:49:00.000Z	SubstreamAI		it doesn't work
2010-12-27T17:50:00.000Z	SubstreamAI		I installed EGGDROP myself, I shoudl be the owner, nto 'root'
2010-12-27T17:50:00.000Z	SubstreamAI		I used Syn. Pack. Man....
2010-12-27T17:50:00.000Z	SubstreamAI		that's what I've been saying
2010-12-27T17:52:00.000Z	SubstreamAI		I'm logged in as MyUserName, and from there I installed EggDrop using the Synaptic Package Manager (SPM).  SPM then installed it to /usr/share/eggdrop and gave the following permissions drwxr-xr-x owner: 'root'
2010-12-27T17:52:00.000Z	SubstreamAI		and now, I can't write there!
2010-12-27T17:52:00.000Z	SubstreamAI		Eggdrop doesn't have permission to write to its own folder and neither do I
2010-12-27T17:52:00.000Z	SubstreamAI		I want the permissions to be drwxrwxr-x
2010-12-27T17:53:00.000Z	SubstreamAI		who is 'root'??
2010-12-27T17:53:00.000Z	SubstreamAI		what does that mean when that's the owner?
2010-12-27T17:53:00.000Z	rs0832	SubstreamAI	root is the ultimate power user in a linux system
2010-12-27T17:54:00.000Z	rs0832	SubstreamAI	lock you out?
2010-12-27T17:54:00.000Z	rs0832	SubstreamAI	ubuntu doesnt support a root user
2010-12-27T17:54:00.000Z	rs0832	SubstreamAI	it is meant as a security measure
2010-12-27T17:55:00.000Z	rs0832	SubstreamAI	yes.. root owns everything
2010-12-27T17:55:00.000Z	rs0832	SubstreamAI	it is made that way for security
2010-12-27T17:59:00.000Z	rs0832	SubstreamAI	a daemon is kind like a bot that is always running in the background on a system
2010-12-27T18:01:00.000Z	rs0832	SubstreamAI	how did you install it?
2010-12-27T18:03:00.000Z	rs0832	SubstreamAI	how did you install it?
2010-12-27T18:04:00.000Z	rs0832	SubstreamAI	then nothing is wrong with it
2010-12-27T18:04:00.000Z	rs0832	SubstreamAI	maybe it's meant to be run as root
