2010-06-09T10:19:00.000Z	Gryllida		hello?
2010-06-09T10:19:00.000Z	nanotube	Gryllida	o/
2010-06-09T10:20:00.000Z	nanotube	Gryllida	just firefox, or everything? there's system -> preferences -> appearance -> fonts...
2010-06-09T10:21:00.000Z	Gryllida	nanotube	I turned it off in the place you're saying about but Firefox ignored my wish to turn it off despite several reboots
2010-06-09T10:24:00.000Z	nanotube	Gryllida	hrm... no idea sorry. maybe you can try stock firefox off mozilla.com and see if that behaves any different?
2010-06-09T10:29:00.000Z	nanotube	Gryllida	well... in that case... you may be kinda sol...
2010-06-09T10:33:00.000Z	Gryllida	nanotube	how do I fix smoothing issue?
2010-06-09T10:33:00.000Z	nanotube	Gryllida	no idea, sorry...
2010-06-09T10:33:00.000Z	Gryllida	nanotube	hmm
2010-06-09T10:34:00.000Z	Gryllida	nanotube	very uncomfortable, actually.
2010-06-09T10:34:00.000Z	Gryllida	nanotube	do you have font smoothing in your firefox now?
2010-06-09T10:34:00.000Z	nanotube	Gryllida	probably... i have my fonts setting set to "subpixel smoothing"...
2010-06-09T10:37:00.000Z	Gryllida	nanotube	please try to set hinting to yes and smoothing to none and to observe whether firefox ignores your preference
2010-06-09T10:41:00.000Z	Gryllida	nanotube	can you try to set it to no smoothing and restart Firefox, will it change anything? as for me, it just ignores my preference
2010-06-09T10:42:00.000Z	nanotube	Gryllida	tried... firefox ignores the settings.
2010-06-09T10:43:00.000Z	Gryllida	nanotube	so? what do I do? It is difficult for me to read smoothed fonts.
2010-06-09T10:43:00.000Z	nanotube	Gryllida	hrm... try following some/any of the suggestions referenced in this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1200992
2010-06-09T10:44:00.000Z	nanotube	Gryllida	though most of the people there seem to be trying to get smoothing /working/ rather than /off/... the idea of creating a .fonts.conf with the requisite settings could be your ticket
2010-06-09T10:51:00.000Z	Gryllida	nanotube	ok but that file only contains hinting settings while I want to turn SMOOTHING off
2010-06-09T10:55:00.000Z	Gryllida	nanotube	ok but that file only contains hinting settings while I want to turn SMOOTHING off ------- are you sure that this is the full solution?
2010-06-09T10:58:00.000Z	nanotube	Gryllida	well, apparently not. i'm just throwing out some ideas for you. i personally have no clue "what the solution is"...
