2006-06-20T05:00:00.000Z	jamey		When I plug in a USB pen drive, it is not automounted nor do I have any /dev/sda*. I'm using 6.06 LTS. Any ideas?
2006-06-20T05:00:00.000Z	apokryphos	jamey	/dev/sdb*?
2006-06-20T05:00:00.000Z	jamey	apokryphos	when I do /dev/s (tab) it only shows shm and snd. No sdb.
2006-06-20T05:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	jamey	are you sure it's plugged in and turned on if it needs to be?
2006-06-20T05:01:00.000Z	jamey	apokryphos	yes it's plugged into Bus 003 when I use lsusb. And it's USB powered, the light is on.
2006-06-20T05:03:00.000Z	jamey	apokryphos	any ideas?
2006-06-20T05:03:00.000Z	apokryphos	jamey	well, plug it in again and then dmesg to see what it's doing
2006-06-20T05:04:00.000Z	jamey	apokryphos	[4295458.153000]  usb-storage: device found at 5 .. [4295458.153000]  usb-storage: waiting for device to settle before scanning
2006-06-20T05:05:00.000Z	apokryphos	jamey	nothing else, now?
2006-06-20T05:06:00.000Z	jamey	apokryphos	http://dawley.me.uk/dmesg
2006-06-20T05:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	jamey	well, there you go, it should be /dev/sda1
2006-06-20T05:07:00.000Z	jamey	apokryphos	but it isn't! Even when I'm root it still has no sda
2006-06-20T05:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	jamey	are you sure? sudo ls /dev/sda* ?
2006-06-20T05:09:00.000Z	jamey	apokryphos	why oh why does ls bring it up but normal browsing does not? Oh well
2006-06-20T05:09:00.000Z	jamey	apokryphos	is there a quick way to mount it now?
2006-06-20T05:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	jamey	err, so it was brought up?
2006-06-20T05:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	jamey	I thought you said it wasn't :P
2006-06-20T05:10:00.000Z	apokryphos	jamey	anyhow, see if it's not already mounted in /media
2006-06-20T05:10:00.000Z	jamey	apokryphos	no it isn't in /media
2006-06-20T05:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	jamey	then mount it... sudo mkdir /media/usb && sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/usb -t vfat
2006-06-20T05:12:00.000Z	jamey	apokryphos	thanks a bunch
