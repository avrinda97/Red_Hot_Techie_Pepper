2009-12-28T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	katyrolfe1971	what are you running them with? dosbox? wine?
2009-12-28T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	katyrolfe1971	sudo apt-get install wine

2009-12-28T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	katyrolfe1971	looks like the version number is relevant, some wont run. some run amazingly
2009-12-28T16:06:00.000Z	katyrolfe1971	ActionParsnip	 I am really new to all of this, and I'm not sure what you mean for me to do?
2009-12-28T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	katyrolfe1971	install wine using software center
2009-12-28T16:12:00.000Z	katyrolfe1971	ActionParsnip	 I have downloaded WINE but I still get this message when i try to run SetupNow.exe   "End-of-central-directory signature not found......"  This is a truncated message by the way...
2009-12-28T16:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	katyrolfe1971	what version is it? 1 2 or 3?
2009-12-28T16:14:00.000Z	katyrolfe1971	ActionParsnip	 It says v254.1 on the disk
2009-12-28T16:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	katyrolfe1971	ok let me websearch
2009-12-28T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	katyrolfe1971	i'm guessing its the first one
2009-12-28T16:17:00.000Z	katyrolfe1971	ActionParsnip	 OK so what must I do?
2009-12-28T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	katyrolfe1971	ok does the game install or is that where you fall short?
2009-12-28T16:19:00.000Z	katyrolfe1971	ActionParsnip	 I get it installed and I can click on all the Icons, even the little graphic is there for it, I just can't make it run.  I used to click on the SetupNow.exe in Windows, but that just gives me the error message
2009-12-28T16:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	katyrolfe1971	ok thats cool, get the latest patch for the game
2009-12-28T16:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	katyrolfe1971	you may also benefit from the lastest wine from here: http://www.winehq.org/download/deb
2009-12-28T16:19:00.000Z	katyrolfe1971	ActionParsnip	 Sorry to be a pain, where would I get that from?
