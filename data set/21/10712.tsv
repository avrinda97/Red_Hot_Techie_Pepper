2005-04-27T15:24:00.000Z	Zugot		the doc is so large, it won't even open on my windows xp desktop with 256MB of memory without some crazy swapping
2005-04-27T15:26:00.000Z	Zugot		anyone here custom compiles their kernels?   i know how to create a new kernel, i just want to make sure i'm doing it the ubuntu way
2005-04-27T15:28:00.000Z	Zugot		breezy is cool as of right this second.   i won't speak for next week
2005-04-27T15:29:00.000Z	Zugot		but breezy is really just hoary right now.   not much work has gone into it
2005-04-27T15:29:00.000Z	Zugot		breezy is still using the same kernel...
2005-04-27T15:30:00.000Z	Zugot		i'll be happy when they upgrade mono to 1.1.x
2005-04-27T15:30:00.000Z	Zugot		newer 2.6.11 kernel
2005-04-27T15:30:00.000Z	Zugot		i'm going to work a beagle like product for kde
2005-04-27T15:31:00.000Z	Zugot		i need to work on my mythtv box today
2005-04-27T15:31:00.000Z	Zugot		i just can't convince myself to get on it

2005-04-27T15:33:00.000Z	Zugot		thanks
2005-04-27T15:33:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Zugot	conceptually it is a little different, but it is the same idea as to what the final product does
2005-04-27T15:37:00.000Z	|QuaD-		so, i am not sure where to ask this, so i hope this is the correct place. I am looking to purchase a ubuntu hoary based shell (monthly fee) with a good uptime (free would be better, but i don't mind paying). does anyone know where i could do so? (if not ubuntu based, debian based)
2005-04-28T16:02:00.000Z	Zugot	|QuaD-	thanks for the link
2005-04-28T16:03:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Zugot	np
