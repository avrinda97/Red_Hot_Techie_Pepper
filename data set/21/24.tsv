2004-12-12T13:40:00.000Z	jdub		depends if you've got a good reason for ordering an insane amount.
2004-12-12T13:41:00.000Z	|QuaD|		i want 20 x86, 5 ppc, and 10 AMD64s
2004-12-12T13:41:00.000Z	|QuaD|		is that insane?
2004-12-12T13:41:00.000Z	jdub		not even remotely
2004-12-12T13:42:00.000Z	|QuaD|	jdub	so somewhere around 5o is fine
2004-12-12T13:42:00.000Z	|QuaD|		i just want to distribute them
2004-12-12T13:42:00.000Z	jdub	|QuaD|	you can order more than that. shipping is the expensive bit, not pressing the cds.
2004-12-12T13:42:00.000Z	|QuaD|	jdub	we pay shipping???
2004-12-12T13:43:00.000Z	jdub		depends what you mean by "we"
2004-12-12T13:43:00.000Z	jdub		you didn't see a credit card field on the order form, did you?
2004-12-12T13:43:00.000Z	|QuaD|		who pays
2004-12-12T13:44:00.000Z	|QuaD|		haha
2004-12-12T13:44:00.000Z	|QuaD|		good point
2004-12-12T13:44:00.000Z	jdub	|QuaD|	shipit's pretty clear: "The Ubuntu team will send you Ubuntu CDs at no charge, for you to install and share. We will cover the cost of shipping the CDs to you as well."
