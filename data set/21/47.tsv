2012-11-08T10:03:00.000Z	markhammel		ah i thought it might be that. c_smith  great tip
2012-11-08T10:05:00.000Z	markhammel		great its loading ill see if it works now
2012-11-08T10:05:00.000Z	markhammel		my terminal ended at 2% [1 virtualbox-4.2 915 kB/59.9 MB 2%]
2012-11-08T10:05:00.000Z	markhammel		when i tried to dl the new one.. i hope its supposed to look like that.
2012-11-08T10:06:00.000Z	markhammel		hmm but i have virtual box installed
2012-11-08T10:06:00.000Z	markhammel		is it possible the old one never uninstalled correctly
2012-11-08T10:08:00.000Z	markhammel		hmm i just noticed i could see my kindle from the usb button at the bottum of virtual drive
2012-11-08T10:08:00.000Z	markhammel		its installing the drivers  r now for it apparently.
2012-11-08T10:08:00.000Z	markhammel		i mean thats not what i neeed it to see i need it to see my iphone... but thats a good sign.
2012-11-08T10:09:00.000Z	c_smith	markhammel	I take it you installed the extensions?
2012-11-08T10:10:00.000Z	markhammel		Yeah c_smith the extension installed fine.. im jsut still wondering about the 2% thing and how if it only ran 2 % am i running virtual box now effectively
2012-11-08T10:10:00.000Z	c_smith		hmmmm..... that's not something I seen Ubuntu do.
2012-11-08T10:10:00.000Z	markhammel		hmm its showing my iphone as an unknown device... and says installation failed.
2012-11-08T10:10:00.000Z	c_smith		but it seems to work correctly
2012-11-08T10:11:00.000Z	markhammel		maybe i should scroll up and redo the steps
2012-11-08T10:12:00.000Z	c_smith	markhammel	might be a good idea
2012-11-08T10:14:00.000Z	markhammel	c_smith	i think its cause i had a second virtualbox running even when i tried to delete it
2012-11-08T10:14:00.000Z	c_smith	markhammel	might be.
2012-11-08T10:15:00.000Z	markhammel		hmm when i try sudo apt-get purge virtualbox
2012-11-08T10:15:00.000Z	markhammel		it says virtual box is not installed so not removed
2012-11-08T10:16:00.000Z	markhammel	c_smith	does this look normal? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1341789/
