2007-10-28T03:02:00.000Z	cdm10		Any Epiphany users in here?
2007-10-28T03:03:00.000Z	cdm10		I'm looking for something like Firefox has that lets me specify custom searches that I can access through the URL bar... in Firefox I can right-click on a search field and add a keyword for it, but Epi's Smart Bookmarks only seem to work on selected text.
2007-10-28T03:04:00.000Z	crdlb	cdm10	it's unintuitive but it can be done
2007-10-28T03:04:00.000Z	cdm10	crdlb	how?
2007-10-28T03:04:00.000Z	crdlb	cdm10	search for some random term, "foo", then bookmark that page, but before adding it, change "foo" to "%s"
2007-10-28T03:05:00.000Z	crdlb	cdm10	then it will show up in the dropdown with "Search the web"
2007-10-28T03:05:00.000Z	cdm10	crdlb	okay, thanks.
2007-10-28T03:56:00.000Z	cdm10	crdlb	mind if I ask you a quick Epi question?
2007-10-28T03:56:00.000Z	crdlb	cdm10	go ahead :)
2007-10-28T03:56:00.000Z	cdm10	crdlb	How do I add a greasemonkey script?
2007-10-28T03:57:00.000Z	crdlb	cdm10	with the greasemonkey extension enabled, just right click the script link and select install
2007-10-28T03:58:00.000Z	cdm10	crdlb	ah, thanks. Perhaps it would be wise for it to detect that the URL I'm viewing is a greasemonkey script, and offer to install it.
2007-10-28T04:01:00.000Z	cdm10	crdlb	How do I remove a userscript when it's installed?
2007-10-28T04:03:00.000Z	crdlb	cdm10	you have to delete it from ~/.gnome2/epiphany/extensions/data :) (no ui unfortunately)
2007-10-28T04:03:00.000Z	cdm10	crdlb	yuck, ok.
2007-10-28T04:19:00.000Z	cdm10	crdlb	More Epi questions... is there a keyboard shortcut to cycle through tabs, like ctrl-tab in FF?
2007-10-28T04:20:00.000Z	crdlb	cdm10	well there's ctrl+pgup/pgdown
2007-10-28T04:20:00.000Z	cdm10	crdlb	ok, that's a little awkward, but I can handle...
2007-10-28T04:21:00.000Z	crdlb	cdm10	also there's an #epiphany channel on irc.gnome.org :)
2007-10-28T04:21:00.000Z	cdm10	crdlb	Fine, send me off somewhere else :)
2007-10-28T04:23:00.000Z	cdm10	crdlb	found it: http://www.sstuhr.dk/epiphany-extensions/#installation
