2010-04-15T23:08:00.000Z	W43372		I'm having an issue with Firefox recently. The browser crashes after being open for a few seconds, the process 'firefox-bin' is listed as Zombie and when I try to restart it tells me that 'firefox-bin' is non responsive and gives me the option of canceling or rebooting anyway.
2010-04-15T23:08:00.000Z	xangua	W43372	have you tried with a fresh fx profile¿¿
2010-04-15T23:09:00.000Z	W43372	xangua	?
2010-04-15T23:12:00.000Z	W43372	xangua	New fx profile?
2010-04-15T23:13:00.000Z	xangua	W43372	new or fresh fx(firefox) profile
2010-04-15T23:13:00.000Z	W43372	xangua	How do I do that?
2010-04-15T23:14:00.000Z	xangua	W43372	just open your home and type control+h; search for the hidden .firefox and move it to somewhere else
2010-04-15T23:14:00.000Z	xangua	W43372	then try to launch fx again
2010-04-15T23:15:00.000Z	W43372	xangua	Thanks, I'll try that. Does that mean that all of my addons and bookmarks and such will go away when I do this?
2010-04-15T23:15:00.000Z	xangua	W43372	only temporaly; it that doesn't work you can put .firefox where it was
2010-04-15T23:15:00.000Z	W43372	xangua	And if it does work?
2010-04-15T23:16:00.000Z	xangua	W43372	then something is wrong with your original profile; maybe some addon
2010-04-15T23:16:00.000Z	W43372	xangua	I just looked in home. I don't have a .firefox...
2010-04-15T23:17:00.000Z	xangua	W43372	sorry, it is .mozilla
2010-04-15T23:18:00.000Z	W43372	xangua	Found it, do I move the whole mozilla folder somewhere else, or do I just move the firefox folder within?
2010-04-15T23:19:00.000Z	xangua	W43372	just the firefox folder profile if you have other mozilla apps
2010-04-15T23:22:00.000Z	W43372	xangua	Losha: that solution didn't do anything. I thought it was, but I checked and there's still a firefox-bin zombie process, and when I tabbed back to check on the browser, it hung.
2011-05-03T00:17:00.000Z	xangua	W43372	first run: sudo apt-get update  , try again
2011-05-03T00:18:00.000Z	W43372	xangua	still got the same error
2011-05-03T00:19:00.000Z	xangua	W43372	you want to install 'compiz-settings-manager' not 'ccsm' since it does not exist
