2005-09-10T06:55:00.000Z	thellama		would any of you recommend installing xmms?
2005-09-10T06:56:00.000Z	nickrud	thellama	sure, it's nice
2005-09-10T06:57:00.000Z	nickrud	thellama	now, that's a matter of taste, and rhythmbox suits my tast :)
2005-09-10T07:01:00.000Z	nickrud	thellama	yup, pretty much so. except, you may want to exchange beep-media-player for xmms
2005-09-10T07:02:00.000Z	thellama	nickrud	beep media player?
2005-09-10T07:02:00.000Z	nickrud	thellama	the successor to xmms
2005-09-10T07:09:00.000Z	nickrud	thellama	the ability to play some video's that totem cannot, from what I hear. I also prefer the way mplayer and firefox interact when I have mozilla-mplayer installed.
2005-09-10T07:10:00.000Z	thellama	nickrud	thanks, I think I keep from installing it, I was just wondering since I used vlc on osx
2005-09-10T07:11:00.000Z	nickrud	thellama	I don't watch a lot of video on my pc (I prefer my tv) but mozilla-mplayer is worth looking at for streaming video.
2005-09-10T07:13:00.000Z	thellama	nickrud	would you recommend mplayer or vlc then?
2005-09-10T07:14:00.000Z	nickrud	thellama	I'd recommend both. They just take a bit of space on your disk, and don't conflict.
2005-09-10T07:15:00.000Z	thellama	nickrud	really? but then I'd to pick one for each video! ;)
2005-09-10T07:28:00.000Z	thellama	nickrud	thanks
2005-09-10T07:29:00.000Z	nickrud	thellama	ignore the last, I was lazy
2005-09-10T07:29:00.000Z	thellama	nickrud	oh no it's totally fine! :)
2005-09-10T07:35:00.000Z	nickrud	thellama	there's not a single app for that; grip or sound-juicer for ripping, rhythmbox/muine for cataloging seem to be the current answers.
2005-09-10T08:34:00.000Z	nickrud	thellama	that stuff is not ready for prime time yet, but it is pretty if it works
2005-09-10T10:04:00.000Z	nickrud	thellama	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/969 is a very good list to use
2005-09-10T10:05:00.000Z	nickrud	thellama	assuming I'm not sucking hind tit on this answer, I've been in and out
2005-09-10T10:06:00.000Z	nickrud	thellama	thanks, there have been days when that was not the case :)
2005-09-10T10:13:00.000Z	nickrud	thellama	probably pointless, since most stuff in backports is backported from breezy, if I understand correctly.
