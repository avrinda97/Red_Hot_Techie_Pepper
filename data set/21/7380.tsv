2008-01-18T10:38:00.000Z	badkitty	Jacob	you can always dual boot, or even test out the OS before you install it
2008-01-18T10:39:00.000Z	badkitty	Jacob	It is very likely you will ned help
2008-01-18T10:40:00.000Z	badkitty	Jacob	If you made it this far, you will do just fine
2008-01-18T10:43:00.000Z	badkitty	Jacob	Any IRC chat client is fine, You can even use chatzilla or the default one that comes with pidgin
2008-01-18T10:46:00.000Z	badkitty	Jacob	You plan on completely moving to ubuntu or do you want to dualboot
2008-01-18T10:47:00.000Z	badkitty	Jacob	Depends, if your worried... dualboot that wa yo can use both, but you need the space for it
2008-01-18T10:48:00.000Z	badkitty	Jacob	Thats enough still
2008-01-18T10:48:00.000Z	badkitty	Jacob	What OS do you currently have?
2008-01-18T10:50:00.000Z	badkitty	Jacob	Basically the ubuntu install does all the work for you, the main thing is setting up the partitions and making sure when you install, ubuntu knows to install only to the empty partition
2008-01-18T10:52:00.000Z	badkitty	Jacob	When you start your pc it will give you a menu and you press up and down keys to select the system
2008-01-18T10:53:00.000Z	badkitty	Jacob	Grub is a bootloader. It runs when the system is started and tells the computer how to load the various installed system
2008-01-18T10:54:00.000Z	badkitty	Jacob	YEs I do.. fedora was too big for me to burn all the cd's
2008-01-18T10:54:00.000Z	badkitty	Jacob	for GRUB?
2008-01-18T11:00:00.000Z	badkitty	Jacob	hmm is he a moderator
2008-01-18T11:01:00.000Z	badkitty	Jacob	See you soon once you have everything installed
