2010-08-27T22:42:00.000Z	Guptan		Any help? Wubi installation got stuck at grub rescue screen after installing package grub-pc package?
2010-08-27T22:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guptan	uhmm
2010-08-27T22:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guptan	did you have a working Wubi install, and then install Grub into it yourself?
2010-08-27T22:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guptan	much better in the long run to use a proper partitioned install by the way of any Desktop Linux distro, be that Ubuntu, or something else
2010-08-27T22:43:00.000Z	Guptan	sebsebseb	Yes I'd a working wubi installation. Then software updates installed grub-pc along with it
2010-08-27T22:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guptan	so Grub got updated, and messed up?
2010-08-27T22:43:00.000Z	Guptan	sebsebseb	yeah i think so
2010-08-27T22:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guptan	ok why were you doing Wubi?  rather than installing from a Live CD by the way?
2010-08-27T22:44:00.000Z	Guptan	sebsebseb	my cd writer was not working then :)
2010-08-27T22:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guptan	i'll look at the bug link that LibertyZero gave
2010-08-27T22:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guptan	hold on
2010-08-27T22:45:00.000Z	Guptan		sebsebseb:okz
2010-08-27T22:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guptan	ok I understand that, you probably don't quite just yet
2010-08-27T22:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb		wow LibertyZero that bug sucks
2010-08-27T22:48:00.000Z	Guptan	sebsebseb	any chance to get it working again?
2010-08-27T22:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guptan	Have you got a Windows CD or DVD?
2010-08-27T22:48:00.000Z	Guptan	sebsebseb	seems like I will require windows installation CD
2010-08-27T22:48:00.000Z	Guptan	sebsebseb	Nope
2010-08-27T22:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guptan	ah
2010-08-27T22:49:00.000Z	Guptan	sebsebseb	any other work arounds?
2010-08-27T22:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guptan	right lets go pm,  since I will go a bit off topic,  and then if I can't help, you can ask here again
