2008-12-23T21:29:00.000Z	VSpike		What's the best scheme for dual booting 7.10 and 8.04? I have two separate partitions, but how should I set up grub?
2008-12-23T21:29:00.000Z	nDevastator	VSpike	you would just want to make sure to have a selection for all options in your grub... im not sure if there is a "best scheme" per se
2008-12-23T21:30:00.000Z	VSpike	nDevastator	so create the menu entries manually?
2008-12-23T21:31:00.000Z	nDevastator	VSpike	yes you can edit your grub @ sudo gedit /boot/grub/menus.lst
2008-12-23T21:32:00.000Z	nDevastator	VSpike	im sorry it would be sudo nano /boot/grub/menus.lst
2008-12-23T21:32:00.000Z	VSpike	nDevastator	both will create menu.lst files in their own /boot/grub/ with their own kernels automagically added... but can I have a single menu that is automatically maintained? Or should I chain the second from the first
2008-12-23T21:33:00.000Z	nDevastator	VSpike	honestly i typically make a seperate boot partition... you might need to refer to someone else in this situation
2008-12-23T21:33:00.000Z	VSpike	nDevastator	and how do you stop them both stomping on each other all the time?
2008-12-23T21:33:00.000Z	VSpike	nDevastator	actually, they are both sharing a separate boot partition at the moment :)
2008-12-23T21:34:00.000Z	VSpike	nDevastator	I was just wondering what the canonical way is.. after all, if you have windows, ubuntu will create a menu entry for it automatically ... so would it not make sense that it would handle additional ubuntu installs somehow?
2008-12-23T21:34:00.000Z	nDevastator	VSpike	it would seem like that would be the case
2008-12-23T21:35:00.000Z	nDevastator	VSpike	must admit im by far no guru
2008-12-23T21:35:00.000Z	VSpike	nDevastator	And I think in a vanilla install it does somehow, but I'm not sure how to get back to that position from the slightly odd custom setup I have :)
2008-12-23T21:36:00.000Z	nDevastator	VSpike	when you say they are sharing a boot partition what boot loader is on that partition
2008-12-23T21:36:00.000Z	VSpike	nDevastator	grub - with a manually maintained menu.lst
2008-12-23T21:36:00.000Z	VSpike	nDevastator	I disabled the automatic generation of menu items because they both kept nuking each other
2008-12-23T21:36:00.000Z	nDevastator	VSpike	okay so do this... whichever ubuntu you installed last... edit that grub to have all necessary options
2008-12-23T21:37:00.000Z	VSpike	nDevastator	but when the other one has a kernel update it will overwrite the mbr
2008-12-23T21:38:00.000Z	VSpike	nDevastator	I've done it with arch and ubuntu on another system by getting arch to install grub on the partition instead of the mbr and then chaining the second grub from the main ubuntu one that lives in the mbr and ubuntu partition
2008-12-23T21:39:00.000Z	nDevastator	VSpike	yes thats what i was saying to do by editting the last installed ubuntu
2008-12-23T21:39:00.000Z	nDevastator	VSpike	edit the grub on that ubuntu partition instead of the MBR
