2012-11-11T21:06:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	You mentioned your laptop broke? Do you need help with something buddy?
2012-11-11T21:13:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	Is there option on your screen, a button to adjust resolution? That could fix it.
2012-11-11T21:16:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	Awesome ;)
2012-11-11T22:25:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	I might help you, I've used emulators.
2012-11-11T22:26:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	Look online for Zsnes emulator. And I'm not sure if even NES ROM would work, since I think it's meant for NES games not SNES.
2012-11-11T22:27:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get install zsnes
2012-11-11T22:29:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	http://www.zsnes.com/
2012-11-11T22:30:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	You need to compile it.
2012-11-11T22:31:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	You sure there isn't zsnes in repositories, since I typed sudo apt-get install zsnes, it showed right away.
2012-11-11T22:32:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	dr_willis: I have 32 bit, and it can install here too.
2012-11-11T22:33:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	Go to software sources, Ubuntu software tab, and check all there.
2012-11-11T22:34:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	Change "download from" to different server.
2012-11-11T22:37:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	Did you change the server from software sources and tried to download it? Please post results here.
2012-11-11T22:42:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	TRy this, go to software sources, other software tab, and check independent repositories if they aren't.
2012-11-11T22:42:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	Check those independent from other sources, than sudo apt-gte update from terminal and try to install now.
2012-11-11T22:47:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	You're missing repositories I guess.
2012-11-11T22:49:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	Yes. You just need to add those missing repositories. I'll help you, let me check.
2012-11-11T22:51:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	Go to software sources, other software tab, add source: deb http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu quantal main
2012-11-11T22:55:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	Do sudo apt-get update
2012-11-11T23:00:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	 Go to that extracted zsnes download with terminal cd /location of zsnes/ than go to src, cd src, than "sudo ./configure", "sudo make", "sudo make install"
2012-11-11T23:09:00.000Z	thelinux	Bier__	sudo apt-get install nasm. And try to compile again zsnes.
