2007-07-08T10:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		Dosent work
2007-07-08T10:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		Yep
2007-07-08T10:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		we tried all the different ways
2007-07-08T10:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		I remember there was a way to dd a copy of the mbr...
2007-07-08T10:36:00.000Z	xtknight	Jack_Sparrow	probably dd if=source of=dest bs=440 count=1
2007-07-08T10:36:00.000Z	xtknight	Jack_Sparrow	try bs=446 instead*
2007-07-08T10:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	xtknight	That looks like it.. any documentation with that..
2007-07-08T10:36:00.000Z	xtknight	Jack_Sparrow	well here is the MBR layout: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record
2007-07-08T10:37:00.000Z	xtknight	Jack_Sparrow	code area is first 446 bytes of the disk.
2007-07-08T10:37:00.000Z	xtknight	Jack_Sparrow	so input would for example be /dev/sda, and output maybe /dev/sdb.  but not /sda1 sdb2 etc.. just sda sdb
2007-08-18T12:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	xtknight	but that is right other than needing sudo?
2007-08-18T12:43:00.000Z	xtknight	Jack_Sparrow	"sudo fdisk -l > ~/myoutput"
2007-08-18T12:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	xtknight	perfect thanks...
2007-12-25T07:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	xtknight	Careful hacking the ipods, I would hate to see you brick it
2007-12-25T07:14:00.000Z	xtknight	Jack_Sparrow	well last thing i tried i ended up Resetting via iTunes on the authorized windows machine and it was ifne
2007-12-25T07:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	xtknight	Just wanted to give a word of caution on doing that.
2007-12-25T07:15:00.000Z	xtknight	Jack_Sparrow	ya i might just hook it up to my VM thru usb
2008-01-26T22:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	xtknight	It just wants you to edit your xorg..
2008-01-26T22:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	xtknight	AN earlier version of K3b had a built in option to enter password for sudo in order to make the changes needed to setup the user with burning rights..
2008-01-26T22:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	xtknight	Things like that can be added program by program, but really isnt needed.
