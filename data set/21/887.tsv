2011-05-11T08:28:00.000Z	escott	trism	KM0201 ok thanks i don't use the commnd line apt enough
2011-05-25T07:53:00.000Z	escott	trism	which is bull**** because the point is to chroot in, the only versions that matter are the versions on the already installed system
2011-05-25T07:55:00.000Z	trism	escott	oh, I see your point, yes it is awkwardly worded
2011-05-25T07:57:00.000Z	escott	trism	unless there was a big libc change or if the 9.10 and later libc cannot interface with 9.4 and earlier kernels... and its been a while since that kind of incompatiblity has been introduced
2012-01-11T08:01:00.000Z	trism	escott	have you seen this? http://www.humans-enabled.com/2011/12/how-to-fix-samsung-galaxy-nexus-mtp.html
2012-01-11T08:17:00.000Z	escott	trism	thanks. i ended up just using samba for this, but i'll bookmark it for the future
2012-03-31T22:17:00.000Z	escott	trism	sweet thanks
2012-04-01T02:38:00.000Z	trism	escott	the (no effects) variant uses metacity but the other one uses compiz
2012-04-01T02:38:00.000Z	trism	escott	well, at least in 12.04, hmm
2012-04-01T02:39:00.000Z	escott	trism	im a little confused about what that gnome-panel is. its linked to gtk-3 is just the gtk2 panel that is ported to gtk3 but minus all the widgets or is it the gnome classic mode to gnome-shell?
2012-04-01T02:41:00.000Z	trism	escott	it is both, it is the old gnome-panel ported to gtk3, it is also the fallback mode for gnome-shell (using metacity), and the applets are still there, some may not work though if they haven't been ported to gtk3
2012-04-01T02:42:00.000Z	escott	trism	wasn't there for a time a gnome-shell/mutter based "look and feel of gnome 2" but it really used mutter/shell/javascript?
2012-04-01T02:43:00.000Z	trism	escott	there is cinnamon that linux mint uses (and there is a ppa for ubuntu around somewhere), which does that to gnome-shell
2012-04-01T02:45:00.000Z	escott	trism	i guess im confused about the relationship between gnome-shell fallback mode and the gnome-panel gtk3 port.
2012-05-31T06:43:00.000Z	trism	escott	I have a sandisk cruzer, and removed u3 with the windows too, the other device is gone after, works fine for liveusb
2012-05-31T06:43:00.000Z	escott	trism	ok i guess ill boot windows later then
2012-10-26T06:01:00.000Z	trism	escott	it is in software-properties-gtk now
2012-10-26T06:02:00.000Z	escott	trism	thanks, blastedt its software-properties-gtk now with the backend being ubuntu-drivers (if you need a text mode tool)
2012-11-26T09:33:00.000Z	escott	trism	thats hardly being creative... what about changing init to /bin/bash
2012-11-26T09:33:00.000Z	trism	escott	indeed
