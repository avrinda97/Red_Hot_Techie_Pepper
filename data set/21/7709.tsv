2006-07-29T08:51:00.000Z	Tamale		Is ssh server off by default in dapper?
2006-07-29T08:51:00.000Z	longwave	Tamale	yes, sshd is not installed by default (though it may be on the server version)
2006-08-04T10:22:00.000Z	longwave	Tamale	hot-pluggable and removable are the same thing, surely?
2006-08-04T10:22:00.000Z	Tamale	longwave	 I honestly didn't think so
2006-08-04T10:22:00.000Z	longwave	Tamale	the only non-removable devices are things like hard disks that can't be switched out after booting
2006-08-04T10:25:00.000Z	longwave	Tamale	that is just a device - the media is the bit you mount, so that's the removable part
2006-08-04T10:27:00.000Z	Tamale	longwave	 So a USB flash drive is a device that ubuntu mounts the media automatically for, correct?  I guess this is what I was calling "Hot-pluggable"
2006-08-04T10:27:00.000Z	longwave	Tamale	yes
2006-08-04T10:37:00.000Z	Tamale	longwave	what do you recommend for irc
2006-08-04T10:38:00.000Z	longwave	Tamale	x-chat or irssi
2006-08-04T11:08:00.000Z	longwave	Tamale	some of the improvements are noted in launchpad: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/edgy/+specs
2006-08-05T07:21:00.000Z	longwave	Tamale	you can have both those installed at the same time
2006-08-05T07:21:00.000Z	Tamale	longwave	but i don't need the 386 do i ?
2006-08-05T07:21:00.000Z	longwave	Tamale	if you don't want any -386 kernels remove linux-image-386 to stop it upgrading those
2006-08-05T07:22:00.000Z	Tamale	longwave	can i just do an apt-get remove on the original kernel ?
2006-08-05T07:23:00.000Z	longwave	Tamale	yes, that should work, but linux-image-386 is a metapackage that always depends on the latest -386 kernel, so if you don't want new ones installed remove that too
2006-08-12T13:04:00.000Z	longwave	Tamale	pastebin your .htaccess
2006-08-12T13:11:00.000Z	longwave	Tamale	you might need the "AllowOverride AuthConfig" in a <Directory> section to let the Auth commands be used in .htaccess
2006-08-12T13:12:00.000Z	longwave	Tamale	by default .htaccess is restricted so you can only use a certain set of config commands in there
2006-08-13T16:26:00.000Z	longwave	Tamale	"dpkg -l" shows you installed packages
2006-08-13T16:26:00.000Z	Tamale	longwave	 Thanks!
