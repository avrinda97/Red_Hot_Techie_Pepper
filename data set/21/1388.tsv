2010-10-07T04:00:00.000Z	phil_in_london	betz	does the embedded system have a wput command, or perhaps an ftp client?
2010-10-07T04:01:00.000Z	betz		i know it runs busybox, its a apacer al670 multimediaplayer
2010-10-07T04:01:00.000Z	phil_in_london		busybox should at least have tftp
2010-10-07T04:02:00.000Z	phil_in_london		if you're wondering whats on your ubuntu side, you do have scp available.
2010-10-07T04:02:00.000Z	betz		and can i scp over telnet
2010-10-07T04:02:00.000Z	betz		?
2010-10-07T04:03:00.000Z	phil_in_london	betz	you can scp over ssh, that may be available on your device.
2010-10-07T04:03:00.000Z	phil_in_london	betz	does your device have sendmail available? does your device have a usb port? does it have support for vfat/msdoc/ext file systems? many questions without a good knowledge of the device.
2010-10-07T04:05:00.000Z	phil_in_london		yeah, it may have tftpd, but its usually an option when compiling "TO" the embedded device.
2010-10-07T04:05:00.000Z	phil_in_london	betz	its got a usb port and DOES support usb hard drive.
2010-10-07T04:06:00.000Z	betz		portscan showed me 80 and 23
2010-10-07T04:06:00.000Z	phil_in_london		so, no ssh then.
2010-10-07T04:06:00.000Z	betz		yes, it has a usb port
2010-10-07T04:06:00.000Z	phil_in_london		and no ftp either.
2010-10-07T04:06:00.000Z	phil_in_london		just telnet and web.
2010-10-07T04:06:00.000Z	phil_in_london	betz	have you telnet'd to it yet, did a little poking around?
2010-10-07T04:06:00.000Z	betz		yes, i'm in right now
2010-10-07T04:07:00.000Z	phil_in_london	betz	all you need to do is find out where it mounts the usb drives. Maybe start with a usb stick. Put some files on it, look for the mount point and see if its the same files you'd put on the stick.
2010-10-07T04:08:00.000Z	phil_in_london	betz	once the usb stick is installed, a mount command should show you your mount points, and I would assume that this device will do an auto mount.
2010-10-07T04:09:00.000Z	phil_in_london	betz	a dmesg command might also show you the mount point as well.
2010-10-07T04:13:00.000Z	betz	phil_in_london	ilovefairuz: got it working with usb, thanks
