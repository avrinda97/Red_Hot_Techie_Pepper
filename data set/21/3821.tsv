2012-09-11T19:10:00.000Z	TomM2		There's nothing in /boot/grub/menu.lst?
2012-09-11T19:10:00.000Z	TomM2		Latest version.
2012-09-11T19:10:00.000Z	TomM2		I'm on ubuntu 11.10
2012-09-11T19:11:00.000Z	TomM2		Thanks.
2012-09-11T19:12:00.000Z	TomM2		I don't think I'm looking for that.
2012-09-11T19:12:00.000Z	TomM2		Let me explain, I want it to say "Mocha" when my system boots.
2012-09-11T19:12:00.000Z	TomM2		In grub it would be "e" right?
2012-09-11T19:13:00.000Z	TomM2		But I need to do it while logged in.
2012-09-11T19:14:00.000Z	DasEi	TomM2	so you want an espeak, say in /etc/rc.local, for instance or in a cronjob, or even in a upstart-event
2012-09-11T19:14:00.000Z	TomM2	dr_willis	Well I ran "figlet Mocha" in terminal and I want the output to display on boot.
2012-09-11T19:15:00.000Z	TomM2	dr_willis	MOTD.
2012-09-11T19:15:00.000Z	TomM2		Like on boot.
2012-09-11T19:16:00.000Z	TomM2		Well when I did "e" on one of my kernels I saw you could add your own lines of text to it such as "echo" I have tested it and I confirm it working.
2012-09-11T19:17:00.000Z	TomM2		Yet where is the data for the kernel stored?
2012-09-11T19:17:00.000Z	TomM2	dr_willis	Well where is it stored anyway?
2012-09-11T19:17:00.000Z	DasEi	TomM2	/boot
2012-09-11T19:18:00.000Z	TomM2		I know.
2012-09-11T19:18:00.000Z	TomM2		But how do you edit the kernel while logged in.
2012-09-11T19:18:00.000Z	DasEi	TomM2	you won't else would have to rebuild init.rd
2012-09-11T19:18:00.000Z	TomM2		If you have ever held shift on boot and then pressed "e" you should understand.
2012-09-11T19:19:00.000Z	DasEi	TomM2	it's clear, mind DrWillis
