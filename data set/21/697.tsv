2011-07-26T13:00:00.000Z	Bluetegu		I'm getting hard time installing ubuntu 11.04 64bit on my T420
2011-07-26T13:01:00.000Z	Bluetegu		First the disk partitioning failed
2011-07-26T13:02:00.000Z	nit-wit	Bluetegu	how did you partition?
2011-07-26T13:02:00.000Z	Bluetegu	nit-wit	used the default partitioning suggested in the installation disk
2011-07-26T13:03:00.000Z	nit-wit	Bluetegu	which is? there are several options at the choice window
2011-07-26T13:06:00.000Z	nit-wit	Bluetegu	generally with a dual boot you want to build the partitions in gparted, or the custom install the last line at the bottom, you could wipe Windows if your not careful
2011-07-26T13:07:00.000Z	nit-wit	Bluetegu	you also must know the limitations of primary partitions as well 4 per hd, or 3 and a extended for the linux/
2011-07-26T13:08:00.000Z	nit-wit	Bluetegu	I would only shrink W7 with its disk manager but gparted will work be careful
2011-07-26T13:10:00.000Z	Bluetegu	nit-wit	Thanks, I'll take a look at disk manager. The idea here is also to shrink the partition and let then ubuntu install do the rest.
2011-07-26T13:11:00.000Z	nit-wit	Bluetegu	I have seen a ot of people when I helped at the UF, who let ubuntu do the work and ended up with a wiped W7.
2011-07-26T13:13:00.000Z	Bluetegu	nit-wit	I don't want to be one of those... Where is the disk manager? Its not in System Tools folder?
2011-07-26T13:14:00.000Z	nit-wit	Bluetegu	in the admin of W7 type disk mana   and you will create new partitions or something like that I'm on W7 now but in a limited account I can't acces it.
2011-07-26T13:15:00.000Z	nit-wit	Bluetegu	I'm going to go to admin be right back
2011-07-26T13:15:00.000Z	Bluetegu	nit-wit	found it...
2011-07-26T13:20:00.000Z	Bluetegu	nit-wit	yes, thanks.
2011-07-26T13:20:00.000Z	Bluetegu	nit-wit	I see the option to shrink the partition
2011-07-26T13:25:00.000Z	Bluetegu	nit-wit	I think I understand now why the ubuntu install partitioning failed. When I press the shrink volume option, it tells me that you can not shrink beyond the point where the unmovable files are located, and gives maximum size of 190G, which is less than what the ubuntu partitioning tried to do.
2011-07-26T13:27:00.000Z	nit-wit	Bluetegu	and if you use gparted to go past that you may have problems, you aware of partitions amounts correct
2011-07-26T13:28:00.000Z	nit-wit	Bluetegu	when I want more space I shutdown the paging, I don't really use the recovery poinys, and defragg to get a smaller shrink
2011-07-26T13:28:00.000Z	Bluetegu	nit-wit	Many thanks. Hopefully I wont have problems going this route.
2011-07-26T13:28:00.000Z	nit-wit	Bluetegu	back up the W7 if you can
