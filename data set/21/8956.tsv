2005-12-08T07:05:00.000Z	SockerFot		exactly
2005-12-08T07:05:00.000Z	SockerFot		thats what i did next
2005-12-08T07:06:00.000Z	SockerFot		i burned it as a image bootable cd
2005-12-08T07:06:00.000Z	SockerFot		and thats when DR-dose came upp
2005-12-08T07:07:00.000Z	SockerFot		if i look at the imagebootableburnedcd in windows, there is also only one ISO-file
2005-12-08T07:07:00.000Z	SockerFot		should i mount it in daemon tools and burn as a copy?
2005-12-08T07:08:00.000Z	SockerFot		but
2005-12-08T07:08:00.000Z	SockerFot		the help on the page says i should only burn it as a data CD
2005-12-08T07:08:00.000Z	SockerFot		and thats exactly what i did the first time
2005-12-08T07:08:00.000Z	SockerFot		so what the fuck man
