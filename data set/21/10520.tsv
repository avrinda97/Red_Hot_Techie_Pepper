2007-06-09T09:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	p1ls	 often ive copied the contents of ALL the cd's to a single dir and ran the installer from there.
2007-06-09T09:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	p1ls	 having to swap out install cd's has always been a bit of a problem.
2007-06-09T09:23:00.000Z	p1ls		so your saying, i should copy two cds, and run em from a dicectory?
