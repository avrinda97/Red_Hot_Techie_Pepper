2011-09-01T15:16:00.000Z	Calinou		go in /home/your_username/.xchat2
2011-09-01T15:16:00.000Z	Calinou		there should be a config file
2011-09-01T15:16:00.000Z	Calinou		check inside, and use ctrl+f to find anything which is related to hiding
2011-09-01T15:16:00.000Z	Calinou		enable it, save, and reload xchat
2011-09-01T15:17:00.000Z	Calinou		*facedesk*
2011-09-01T15:17:00.000Z	Calinou		xchat + windows = sucks
2011-09-01T15:17:00.000Z	Calinou		dunno
2011-09-01T15:19:00.000Z	Calinou		it's a channel
2011-09-01T15:19:00.000Z	Calinou		you shouldn't use xchat on windows anyway... it sucks
2011-09-01T15:19:00.000Z	Calinou		it's not even free
2011-09-01T15:19:00.000Z	theadmin	Calinou	Somebody made a cygwin-based free version somewhere
2012-01-22T20:42:00.000Z	theadmin	Calinou	java path? huh?
2012-01-22T20:42:00.000Z	theadmin	Calinou	You mean the default java binary used?
2012-01-22T20:46:00.000Z	Calinou	theadmin	so yeah... how to? I tried to follow the method on the java website, had to revert the edit to bashrc
2012-01-22T20:47:00.000Z	theadmin	Calinou	Well, "update-alternatives" should be used iirc, but I'm not an Ubuntu user so I can't tell you the exact command(s).
2012-01-22T20:51:00.000Z	Calinou	theadmin	got an idea. is it possible to "create" a command so "sunjava6" points to sun's java 6 instead of openjdk?
2012-01-22T20:52:00.000Z	theadmin	Calinou	I guess, just make a script in /usr/local/bin/
2012-09-19T19:55:00.000Z	Calinou	theadmin	is a capital R needed?
2012-09-19T19:56:00.000Z	theadmin	Calinou	I don't see a lowercase "-r" option anywhere in man chown... So I think yes.
2012-10-10T10:30:00.000Z	Calinou	theadmin	heh, the installer should tell you what it does when you use the other options too, imo (just a suggestion)
2012-10-10T10:30:00.000Z	theadmin	Calinou	Yeah it's obvious, have no idea why it doesn't do that
