2008-10-31T04:34:00.000Z	n8tuser	wers	some features are not familiar to us yet, so perhaps you can google?
2008-10-31T04:54:00.000Z	n8tuser	wers	far too new, so it has not been updated, wait in a couple of days perhaps?
2008-10-31T04:55:00.000Z	wers	n8tuser	i cant even see xchat
2008-10-31T04:55:00.000Z	wers	n8tuser	or gnome-do but i can install em using sudo apt-get

2008-10-31T04:56:00.000Z	wers	n8tuser	i have no problem with that. i'm wondering why uninstalled apps wont show up on synaptic
2008-10-31T04:57:00.000Z	n8tuser	wers	uninstalled? are they even listed as potentially to be installed?
2008-10-31T04:57:00.000Z	wers	n8tuser	they're not even listed
2008-10-31T04:58:00.000Z	n8tuser	wers	far too new i say, wait in  few days or so..
2008-10-31T04:58:00.000Z	wers	n8tuser	uninstalled apps dont appear at all, even the ones that should obviously be on the official repos
2008-10-31T04:59:00.000Z	wers	n8tuser	http://paste.ubuntu.com/64921/
2008-10-31T05:00:00.000Z	n8tuser	wers	so it is there, do the same for the ones you are looking for

2008-10-31T05:01:00.000Z	n8tuser	wers	its okay to admit operator error
2008-10-31T05:01:00.000Z	wers	n8tuser	what's operator error?
2008-10-31T05:01:00.000Z	wers	n8tuser	maybe, what fixed it was to update package list
2008-10-31T05:02:00.000Z	n8tuser	wers	if you have not done update, then yeah
