2007-02-02T09:16:00.000Z	Wimpog		GUYS, how can I boot from CD in grub when the system starts up?
2007-02-02T09:16:00.000Z	frogzoo	Wimpog	usually change your bios to look for cd first
2007-02-02T09:17:00.000Z	Wimpog	frogzoo	I did set boot priorities to CD, but it does not boot from CD
2007-02-02T09:17:00.000Z	frogzoo	Wimpog	maybe the cds not bootable
2007-02-02T09:18:00.000Z	Wimpog	frogzoo	it should be...
2007-02-13T10:03:00.000Z	frogzoo	Wimpog	nopers, means they did away with inittab :)
2007-02-13T10:04:00.000Z	frogzoo	Wimpog	look in /etc/event.d/
2007-02-13T10:06:00.000Z	Wimpog	frogzoo	inittab isn't present in /etc/event.d
2007-02-13T10:06:00.000Z	frogzoo	Wimpog	no, because upstart doesn't use inittab, it uses scripts
2007-02-13T10:07:00.000Z	Wimpog	frogzoo	So why don't I have inittab file at all?
2007-02-13T10:07:00.000Z	frogzoo	Wimpog	cos edgy uses upstart
2007-02-13T10:08:00.000Z	Wimpog	frogzoo	whereis that upstart? Like I want to check the boot level, where do I see that?
2007-02-13T10:08:00.000Z	frogzoo	Wimpog	just 'runlevel' will do that, but to change default bootlevel, well hmm..
2007-02-13T10:09:00.000Z	frogzoo	Wimpog	check /etc/event.d/rc-default
2007-02-13T10:10:00.000Z	Wimpog	frogzoo	it doesn't say how to change the default run level
2007-02-13T10:12:00.000Z	Wimpog	frogzoo	I also saw very few (like 2 or 3)  messages on startup, until I removed 'quite' in the menu.lst where it said 'quite splash' IS THIS OK??? I mean is it OK that I did not see many messages like starting dns, starting dhcp, starting mysqld, etc...
2007-02-13T10:12:00.000Z	frogzoo	Wimpog	that's what quiet does
2007-02-13T10:13:00.000Z	Wimpog	frogzoo	I'm in the middle of either something is wrong with my system OR that's how it should be... I'm clueless right now
2007-02-13T10:13:00.000Z	frogzoo	Wimpog	no /etc/inittab on edgy is the default
2007-02-13T10:14:00.000Z	Wimpog	frogzoo	because before I had Hoary and later upgraded to edgy. That had inittab. BUT now i reformated the HDD and installed fresh edgy.
2007-02-13T10:15:00.000Z	frogzoo	Wimpog	correct - no inittab is needed for a default edgy install
