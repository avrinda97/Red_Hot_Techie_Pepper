2006-08-01T09:28:00.000Z	jordan		Please respond
2006-08-01T09:29:00.000Z	jordan		but how would i set it up?
2006-08-01T09:31:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	jordan	 why don't you just use a crossover cable
2006-08-01T09:31:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	jordan	 you could connect the two computers with a crossover cable then use something like firestarter to enable connection sharing (with something like a secondary ethernet connection or wireless)
2006-08-01T09:33:00.000Z	jordan	joshuapurcell	Whats a crossover cable?
2006-08-01T09:33:00.000Z	jordan	joshuapurcell	And how much are they :(
2006-08-01T09:34:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	jordan	 it's an ethernet cable with the wires on both ends matched up to allow computer-to-computer talking (rather than computer-to-switch). they cost about $10-$15 bucks at any best buy or compusa, or you can find out how to make one from a regular cable online
2006-08-01T09:35:00.000Z	jordan	joshuapurcell	Are they the onse that are used for The direct rougher to Pc connection?
2006-08-01T09:36:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	jordan	 once you get a crossover cable you can connect your PCs together, make sure you assign an IP address/subnet on both machines on the same network, then you should be able to talk between them
2006-08-01T09:36:00.000Z	jordan	joshuapurcell	But would i have one? Like a Dsl connection card
2006-08-01T09:37:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	jordan	 you probably don't have a crossover cable unless you know about it... many modems and routers made today don't require a crossover cable... they can automatically tell what you are using
2006-08-01T09:37:00.000Z	jordan	joshuapurcell	What does it look like?
2006-08-01T09:37:00.000Z	jordan	joshuapurcell	I have 100's of cords...
2006-08-01T09:38:00.000Z	jordan	joshuapurcell	And ones fron radioshack i dont know what they do..
2006-08-01T09:38:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	jordan	 but computer ethernet cards can't automatically tell what you are trying to connect them to. crossover cables look exactly like regular ones, but the only difference would be the pinouts on one of the ends. there are only two ways any ethernet cable would normally be pinned out
2006-08-01T09:40:00.000Z	jordan	joshuapurcell	I'll have to look that up
2006-08-01T09:40:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	jordan	 i think i sent a link above
