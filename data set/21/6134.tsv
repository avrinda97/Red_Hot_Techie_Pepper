2007-05-30T05:58:00.000Z	jamster545		i did
2007-05-30T05:58:00.000Z	ajax4_	jamster545	Did you try running it from the command line and reading the output?
2007-05-30T05:58:00.000Z	ajax4_	jamster545	You'd have to post the output on pastebin before anyone on here would be able to guess why you are having problems.
2007-05-30T05:59:00.000Z	ajax4_	jamster545	I don't think it will let you. What problems are you having with pastebin?
2007-05-30T06:00:00.000Z	ajax4_	jamster545	You can try it.
2007-05-30T06:01:00.000Z	ajax4_	jamster545	Try to send me a private message with the output
2007-05-30T06:02:00.000Z	ajax4_	jamster545	Now send me the output through the private chat.
2007-05-30T06:02:00.000Z	ajax4_	jamster545	I saw the hello. Now paste the output.
2007-05-30T06:03:00.000Z	jamster545	ajax4_	ok
2007-05-30T06:03:00.000Z	jamster545	ajax4_	it might take a minute to type the whole output
2007-05-30T06:03:00.000Z	ajax4_	jamster545	Don't type it, cut and paste it.
2007-05-30T06:04:00.000Z	ajax4_	jamster545	How can you sure it will be exact then?
2007-05-30T06:09:00.000Z	jamster545	ajax4_	i got disconnected
2007-05-30T06:10:00.000Z	ajax4_	jamster545	Okay. Just paste that stuff to me privately when you can.
2007-05-30T06:12:00.000Z	jamster545	ajax4_	i sent it
2007-05-30T06:13:00.000Z	jamster545	ajax4_	are you there?
2007-05-30T06:13:00.000Z	ajax4_	jamster545	I got it. I'm reading it but I can't help. I know how you can paste your stuff into pastebin though so someone else can help.
2007-05-30T06:14:00.000Z	ajax4_	jamster545	Try pasting that output into pastebin but make sure you turn on JavaScript first.
2007-05-30T06:16:00.000Z	ajax4_	jamster545	The ghost is gone now.
