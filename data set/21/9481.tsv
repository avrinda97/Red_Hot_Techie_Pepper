2006-05-21T10:09:00.000Z	Agent_bob		ok anyone watch vidios in console with vlc ?
2006-05-21T10:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	I use mplayer.
2006-05-21T10:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	might need an AA or a caca plugin dohickey
2006-06-03T12:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	nope.
2006-06-03T12:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	suggest you google
2007-10-16T13:06:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	It exists, thats what hes trying to tell you.  It's called gnome-open
2008-03-03T09:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	two reasons, root account has no password (is locked), second, root is disabled form logging in via SSH usually
2008-03-03T09:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	The root account is locked by default (as no password).  And then view in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and look at... well, near the top.  PermitRootLogin, it's no by default on dapper anyway
2008-03-03T09:50:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	You never said that, now did you?
2008-03-03T09:52:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	And you do have a root password?
2008-03-03T09:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	This channel assumes you don't have a root password set, so your question didn't seem odd in the first place (we get that sort of nescience all the time)
2008-03-26T06:37:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	no, thats backwards.
2008-03-26T06:39:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	Hmm, no, it's not backwards.  It just defies logic.
2008-07-20T12:51:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	Than ~/bin?
2008-07-20T12:52:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	/bin is flat wrong
2008-10-05T04:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	Any particular reason you're on dapper still?
2008-10-05T04:37:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	You might try contacting your LoCo team, see if they can get you a Hardy disk.
2008-10-05T04:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	Wifi is a lot easier on Hardy than it is on Dapper, that's for sure.  Lot more supported without any hassle.
2008-10-05T04:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	8.04.1 has most of the updates already.  And they can always give you an 8.04.2 disk in January, and that'll have the updates included (that is, the alternate CD, which can be used to update)
2008-10-05T04:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	Dapper is going to have just as many, if not more, updates than Hardy.
2008-10-05T07:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Agent_bob	he doesn't have them.
