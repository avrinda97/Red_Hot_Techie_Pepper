2006-11-19T07:00:00.000Z	Skwid_		and it seems that im running xgl + compiz now, even without chosing it when logging in !
2006-11-19T07:00:00.000Z	Skwid_		isn't that odd ?
2006-11-19T07:01:00.000Z	Skwid_		:)
2006-11-19T07:02:00.000Z	Skwid_		there is real transparency
2006-11-19T07:03:00.000Z	Skwid_		desktop switching is like a 3d cube
2006-11-19T07:03:00.000Z	Skwid_		no it's gnome
2006-11-19T07:04:00.000Z	Skwid_		i love this ! but it's really awkward
2006-11-19T07:05:00.000Z	Skwid_		what am i running then ?
2006-11-19T07:05:00.000Z	Skwid_		:)
2006-11-19T07:07:00.000Z	Skwid_		anybody have a clue where my transparent windows and 3d desktop switching could come from if it's not compiz ?
2006-11-19T07:08:00.000Z	steffl	Skwid_	don`t you know what you have changed?
2006-11-19T07:08:00.000Z	Skwid_	steffl	i just upgraded to edgy
2006-11-19T07:08:00.000Z	Skwid_	steffl	unless it's all just gnome 2.16 features ...
2006-11-19T07:09:00.000Z	steffl	Skwid_	it won`t come with the default installation
2006-11-19T07:09:00.000Z	steffl	Skwid_	so must have had s.th. like compiz installed before
2006-11-19T07:10:00.000Z	Skwid_	steffl	yeah, i had compiz installed before
2006-11-19T07:10:00.000Z	Skwid_	steffl	but before, i had to log into gdm with the XGL option
2006-11-19T07:10:00.000Z	Skwid_		now, im regularly logged in ...
2006-11-19T07:12:00.000Z	steffl	Skwid_	then it will be still compiz
2006-11-19T07:13:00.000Z	steffl	Skwid_	you just don`t need the XGL option anymore, I guess
2006-11-19T07:13:00.000Z	Skwid_	steffl	that's weird ... cause i have no 'compix' process running
