2010-01-20T03:44:00.000Z	Darkedge	unop	Sorry, I kinda wanted it to be replaced with nothing..
2010-01-20T03:44:00.000Z	unop	Darkedge	and that's what the command does
2010-01-20T03:45:00.000Z	Darkedge	unop	Well I looked in one of the .desktop files, and its been replaced with "" not a black space =/
2010-01-20T03:46:00.000Z	unop	Darkedge	was   ShowOnlyIn=GNOME   originally quoted in the file??
2010-01-20T03:46:00.000Z	Darkedge	unop	I don't think so.
2010-01-20T03:47:00.000Z	unop	Darkedge	 can you put show us just the original line ??
2010-01-20T03:48:00.000Z	Darkedge	unop	Can't you just peice a command to search for "" and replace? thanks.
2010-01-20T03:48:00.000Z	Darkedge	unop	=/ I don't have the original file sorry.
2010-01-20T03:49:00.000Z	unop	Darkedge	 sed -i 's/\"\"//g' /usr/share/applications/*
2010-01-20T03:51:00.000Z	Darkedge	unop	=/ that aren't working
2010-01-20T03:53:00.000Z	unop	Darkedge	you wanted to replace two double-quote marks with nothing, right?

2010-01-20T04:01:00.000Z	unop	Darkedge	for your future reference, there's #bash, ##sed and #awk ...
2010-01-20T04:01:00.000Z	Darkedge	unop	ok thanks
2010-01-20T06:15:00.000Z	unop	Darkedge	could it be because you've been playing about with the /usr/share/applications/gnome-panel.desktop file?
2010-01-20T06:18:00.000Z	Darkedge	unop	Yeah, I added "showingnomeonly" if that changes anything.
2010-01-20T06:18:00.000Z	unop	Darkedge	probably your problem then
