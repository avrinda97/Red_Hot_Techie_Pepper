2007-01-02T15:22:00.000Z	Jan18		Hello! Someone knows how i can fix this? jan@ubuntu:~$ debian/rules updateconfigs
2007-01-02T15:22:00.000Z	Jan18		-bash: debian/rules: No such file or directory
2007-01-02T15:23:00.000Z	fowlduck	Jan18	it doesn't appear that there is a debian/rules file that exists.  Are you doing packaging of some sort?
2007-01-02T15:23:00.000Z	Jan18	fowlduck	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile - I try to get 1000HZ (/boot/config-...)
2007-01-02T15:25:00.000Z	fowlduck	Jan18	can you paste the result of ls -la from your current directory?
2007-01-02T15:26:00.000Z	fowlduck	Jan18	in the future, try to paste in the pastebin
2007-01-02T15:27:00.000Z	Jan18	fowlduck	Know what i have to do?
2007-01-02T15:28:00.000Z	fowlduck	Jan18	please pastebin the results of ls -la in that directory (pastebin is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org

2007-01-02T15:30:00.000Z	fowlduck	Jan18	you're trying to run debian/rules but there is no debian directory in your current directory
2007-01-02T15:32:00.000Z	fowlduck	Jan18	looks like you need to navigate to the directory where you extracted or downloaded the kernel source
2007-01-02T15:36:00.000Z	Jan18	fowlduck	"locate debian" gives no match..
2007-01-02T15:37:00.000Z	fowlduck	Jan18	ok, can you pastebin the contents of your current terminal so I can see all that you have done so far with this whole kernel compile?
2007-01-02T15:37:00.000Z	fowlduck	Jan18	also, no offense intended, but if you can't locate the file to run, you may want to reconsider compiling a new kernel until you understand the linux system and command line a little better..
2007-01-02T15:40:00.000Z	Jan18	fowlduck	I only want to change the HZ from 250 to 1000. Not recompil the kernel.. Thought i could do it with "debian/rules updateconfigs"-command.
2007-01-02T15:40:00.000Z	fowlduck	Jan18	you mean MHz?
2007-01-02T15:41:00.000Z	Jan18	fowlduck	No. I mean CONFIG_HZ=1000
2007-01-02T15:42:00.000Z	fowlduck	Jan18	I don't think I know what you're doing, or that you're aware of the possible and probably ramifications of changing the kernel configuration without knowing precisely what you're doing
2007-01-02T15:44:00.000Z	fowlduck	Jan18	what makes you think the 250 isn't the proper configuration?
2007-01-02T15:49:00.000Z	Jan18	fowlduck	all my other servers with 5.04 (this is 6.x) has 1000 HZ. 250 HZ gives me wrong FPS at counter-strike servers..
2007-01-02T15:51:00.000Z	fowlduck	Jan18	ok, well that makes sense, to change your kernel config is something I'm not experienced with on Ubuntu, and I'm afraid you have now stepped outside of my area of expertise, sorry
