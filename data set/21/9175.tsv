2005-10-29T09:09:00.000Z	alakhia		thought it would be just one message
2005-10-29T09:09:00.000Z	sproingie	alakhia	it's possibly a glibc incompatbility.  only tarantella support would know for sure
2005-10-29T09:10:00.000Z	alakhia	sproingie	hmm, well, thought I would run it by you guys first
2005-10-29T09:10:00.000Z	alakhia	sproingie	searching on internet only points me to hummingbird having similar issues
2005-10-29T09:11:00.000Z	sproingie	alakhia	syntax errors sounds like formats changed, maybe extra crud in the files that tarantella can't deal with
2005-10-29T09:11:00.000Z	alakhia	sproingie	and they refer XKEYSYMDB file that needs to be set correctly
2005-10-29T09:11:00.000Z	sproingie	alakhia	that sounds like it could be related ... try it
2005-10-29T09:12:00.000Z	sproingie		exceed's pretty different from tarantella, but maybe it's the same prob
2005-10-29T09:12:00.000Z	alakhia	sproingie	but the help is specific to hummingbird. Basically telling hummingbird on where to find that file.
2005-10-29T09:12:00.000Z	alakhia		sproingie; also, X doesn't seem to have that file. Or atleast not on my system
2005-10-29T09:12:00.000Z	sproingie	alakhia	perhaps tarantella has a setting that looks for that file too.  a lot of stuff in X moved around between breezy and hoary
2005-10-29T09:13:00.000Z	alakhia	sproingie	but i can't find the file myself
