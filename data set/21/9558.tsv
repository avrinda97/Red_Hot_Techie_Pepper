2005-08-31T11:52:00.000Z	franco64		learn linux from beginner to advance there is always thing to learn
2005-08-31T11:53:00.000Z	franco64		coyctecm: to learn any linux u first have to go beyond yourself
2005-08-31T11:54:00.000Z	franco64		and this is a great start for anyone
2005-08-31T11:54:00.000Z	franco64		there is plenty of info and irc chats for people to get to grips with this
2005-08-31T11:54:00.000Z	franco64		u have to push yourself or why go to linux
2005-08-31T11:55:00.000Z	franco64		stay with windows (aarrgghh) or mac (which i have to say i do love) have loads of macs
2005-08-31T11:56:00.000Z	franco64		and the mac os is just another linux (sort of distro) and that is what got me interested in linux
2005-08-31T11:56:00.000Z	franco64		well adriyel i have a pc that has windows and ubuntu twin boot
2005-08-31T11:57:00.000Z	franco64		i have three macs which i love to do graphics (which i have to say that linux is not the great at)
2005-08-31T11:57:00.000Z	franco64		and linux for system admin stuff
2005-08-31T11:58:00.000Z	deprave	franco64	......system administration is done on macs, unix boxes, xbox's, TI83 graphing calculators. you're just making excuses not to learn
2005-08-31T11:59:00.000Z	franco64	deprave	maybe
2005-08-31T12:00:00.000Z	deprave	franco64	: no, linux isn't.
2005-08-31T12:01:00.000Z	deprave	franco64	OSX is powered on a FreeBSD based system, which is not Linux. being a system administrator i would hope you could differentiate the two
2005-08-31T12:02:00.000Z	franco64	deprave	the structure is still the same
2005-08-31T12:02:00.000Z	deprave	franco64	hardly, maybe the core principals
2005-08-31T12:03:00.000Z	deprave	franco64	: i haven't used mac since i was in grade school, i use unix for desktop operations and 'system administration' as you put it
2005-08-31T12:06:00.000Z	deprave	franco64	anything you can do on your little mac boxes i can do on any pc, and probably better. and also my dad can beat your dad up
2005-08-31T12:06:00.000Z	deprave	franco64	: it's a joke
2005-08-31T12:06:00.000Z	deprave	franco64	yes but i read at a college level
2005-08-31T12:08:00.000Z	deprave	franco64	: your theory is humerous
