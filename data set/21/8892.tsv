2006-06-29T06:25:00.000Z	cartesian1984	edu	Try using a command line smb client and see if it gives you an error.
2006-06-29T06:27:00.000Z	edu	cartesian1984	good idea, how?
2006-06-29T06:27:00.000Z	cartesian1984	edu	I don't know of any, let me ask some other friends.
2006-06-29T06:28:00.000Z	edu	cartesian1984	thanks a lot
2006-06-29T06:28:00.000Z	cartesian1984	edu	do sudo apt-get install smbclient
2006-06-29T06:28:00.000Z	cartesian1984	edu	No problem.
2006-06-29T06:29:00.000Z	edu	cartesian1984	I have already installed... I can run smbclient now
2006-06-29T06:29:00.000Z	cartesian1984	edu	all right, try accessing that share, then.
2006-06-29T06:34:00.000Z	edu	cartesian1984	it connects OK
2006-06-29T06:34:00.000Z	cartesian1984	edu	Ok....odd.....maybe its a problem with the browser then?
2006-06-29T06:34:00.000Z	cartesian1984	edu	Or maybe the hostname was changed
2006-06-29T06:35:00.000Z	edu	cartesian1984	I know what's the problem now: NETBIOS hostname
2006-06-29T06:37:00.000Z	edu	cartesian1984	smbclient //server/shared DOES NOT WORK, but smbclient //192.168.2.1/shared works OK
2006-06-29T06:37:00.000Z	cartesian1984	edu	oh, all right.
2006-06-29T06:38:00.000Z	edu	cartesian1984	thanks for your help
2006-06-29T06:38:00.000Z	cartesian1984	edu	no problem
2006-06-29T06:40:00.000Z	edu	cartesian1984	do you know how the hostname ATLAS can be associated with its IP?
2006-06-29T06:41:00.000Z	cartesian1984	edu	sorry...dunno.
