2009-08-25T04:36:00.000Z	mnaines		How much of a difference does 100mA make on battery runtime for laptops?
2009-08-25T04:36:00.000Z	Ben64	mnaines	depends how much said laptop uses per minute
2009-08-25T04:36:00.000Z	mnaines	Ben64	Is there a way I can determine that?
2009-08-25T04:37:00.000Z	Ben64	mnaines	i have an old xubuntu on my laptop, the power manager shows power usage in graph form
2009-08-25T04:37:00.000Z	mnaines	Ben64	Hmm...Would the "Battery Charge Monitor" applet show that?
2009-08-25T04:38:00.000Z	Ben64	mnaines	not sure what it was called on my computer
2009-08-25T04:39:00.000Z	mnaines	Ben64	depends on what mode I set it for...If I set it for OnDemand or Performance, it is exactly 4 hours of runtime on a 6000mAh battery, but if I manually set the CPU frequency for 800MHz (it can go up to 1.86GHz), the time goes up to exactly 5 hours on a full charge
2009-08-25T05:01:00.000Z	Ben64	mnaines	lol, they can't do anything
2009-08-25T05:02:00.000Z	mnaines	Ben64	oh, they can...I routinely go into the Hacker's Lounge on Yahoo and see them selling credit card and bank account info
2009-08-25T05:02:00.000Z	Ben64	mnaines	where do i find said area
2009-08-25T05:03:00.000Z	mnaines	Ben64	go into Yahoo Chat list and look for the category "Computers and Internet" then look for "Hacker's Lounge:1"
2009-08-25T05:03:00.000Z	Ben64	mnaines	on messenger?
2009-08-25T05:04:00.000Z	mnaines	Ben64	Yes...Feel free to call them Script Kiddies, too, just to see what they can do
2009-08-25T08:36:00.000Z	Ben64	mnaines	you know of a good card for packet injection? :)
2009-08-25T08:37:00.000Z	mnaines	Ben64	let me see if I can find you a good list
2009-08-25T08:49:00.000Z	mnaines	Ben64	Linux is one of those things where you never stop learning
2009-08-25T08:49:00.000Z	Ben64	mnaines	oh i know
2009-08-25T08:49:00.000Z	mnaines	Ben64	Hence why I chose it to enter the world of Linux
2009-08-25T08:51:00.000Z	mnaines	Ben64	I like Ubuntu because its not much different from Windows in terms of user-friendliness, and its easy enough to figure out that a little bit of effort and some help from Google and you can pretty much go it alone
2009-08-25T08:51:00.000Z	Ben64	mnaines	but it doesn't lock you out of advanced functions, if you choose to use em
2009-08-25T08:53:00.000Z	mnaines	Ben64	nope, and I like the fact that the gui has a small footprint...4GB of hard drive space and 512MB of RAM are all that is needed, and with a dual-core at 800MHz on each core, I never notice a difference in performance
