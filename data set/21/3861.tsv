2009-07-07T05:38:00.000Z	Babbleback		i have a netbook running the netbook remix.. its got problems so i was going to reinstall... i am attempting to save the data by booting from a UNR flash drive and copy the data to another flash drive.. it fails to copy because it says i don't have access to the files i am trying to copy... how do i copy these files
2009-07-07T05:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Babbleback	 the files have different owners/permissions - so you will need to access them with root rights.

2009-07-07T05:39:00.000Z	Babbleback	Dr_Willis	where are the drives mounted
2009-07-07T05:40:00.000Z	Babbleback	Dr_Willis	not /mnt that folder is empty
2009-07-07T05:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Babbleback	 Mount the filesystem somewhere then.
2009-07-07T05:40:00.000Z	Babbleback		i was attempting to use the file browser built in... the drives are already mounted
2009-07-07T05:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Babbleback	 they are proberly not mounted automacally anywhere.
2009-07-07T05:40:00.000Z	Babbleback	Dr_Willis	 they are because i'm browsing them
2009-07-07T05:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Babbleback	 when you access them - THEN they get mounted. to /media/ i imagine.. not /mnt/
2009-07-07T05:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Babbleback	 try the mount command and see?
2009-07-07T05:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Babbleback	 ubuntu uses /media  not /mnt
2009-07-07T05:42:00.000Z	Babbleback		i found them in media
2009-07-07T05:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Babbleback	 amazing. :)
2009-07-07T05:42:00.000Z	Babbleback		read is available for the drive that i want to copy from though
2009-07-07T05:42:00.000Z	Babbleback		for user group and other
2009-07-07T05:44:00.000Z	Babbleback	Dr_Willis	you say that i have to set permissions but i already have read permissions for the drive that is not allowing me to copy from it
2009-07-07T05:49:00.000Z	Babbleback	Dr_Willis	i am able to do it in bash using sudo.. how would i have done it as root using the GUI file browser
2009-07-07T05:57:00.000Z	Babbleback	Dr_Willis	well I guess i should at least thank you for pointing me to the correct mount location
2009-07-07T05:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Babbleback	 yep. Ubuntu Basics
2009-07-07T05:59:00.000Z	Babbleback	Dr_Willis	do you know how to execute commands as root using the GUI?
