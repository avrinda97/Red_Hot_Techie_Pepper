2005-08-08T07:46:00.000Z	grigora		hi, could someone tell me how I can get foreign characters (Armenian) to show up in OpenOffice. I set up the keyboard layout and was able to type in the test box correctly, however when I do the same in OO, I get gibberish, thanks
2005-08-08T07:48:00.000Z	reka	grigora	er, perhaps install the armenian language support package for OO?
2005-08-08T07:49:00.000Z	grigora	reka	thanks, but what exactly is it? do you have a package name?
2005-08-08T07:50:00.000Z	reka	grigora	er, excuse my ignorance, but what's your language called?  i can't find armenian
2005-08-08T07:52:00.000Z	grigora	reka	it's called Armenina
2005-08-08T07:52:00.000Z	grigora	reka	typo: Armenian
2005-08-08T07:53:00.000Z	reka	grigora	*nod*  sorry, not sure... i can't find an armenian package when i 'apt-cache search openoffice language'
2005-08-08T07:54:00.000Z	reka	grigora	try searching the forums/wiki/googling
2005-08-08T07:54:00.000Z	reka	grigora	unless someone else who has installed language support in OO can help
2005-08-08T07:55:00.000Z	grigora	reka	thanks for trying
2005-08-08T08:03:00.000Z	reka	grigora	it's in universe
2005-08-08T08:04:00.000Z	grigora	reka	what does that mean? I am very new to Ubuntu, so please bear with me
2005-08-08T08:04:00.000Z	reka	grigora	you need to enable a certain repository the package is in
2005-08-08T08:05:00.000Z	reka	grigora	by default, it's disabled
2005-08-08T08:06:00.000Z	grigora	reka	thanks
2005-08-08T08:10:00.000Z	grigora	reka	I got Universe added and was able to install xfonts* packages, how do I now tell my system to use it? TIA
2005-08-08T08:12:00.000Z	reka	grigora	good questio
2005-08-08T08:13:00.000Z	reka	grigora	i'm not sure exactly....i've never had the need to install another language's fonts. sorry.
2005-08-08T08:13:00.000Z	reka	grigora	but i'd assume they'd be installed/set-up for you automatically if you installed via apt-get/synaptic
2005-08-08T08:53:00.000Z	reka	grigora	nice.  you got it working?
2005-08-08T08:53:00.000Z	grigora	reka	not really, I was just testing GAIM, but OO doesn't displays the chars correctly
