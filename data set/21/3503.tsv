2008-12-11T11:46:00.000Z	almark		:Severian And my card is a Ati radeon 8500
2008-12-11T11:47:00.000Z	almark		:Severian I know for a fact all versions work in windows, but that not important.
2008-12-11T11:48:00.000Z	almark		:Severian  you should try Blender its great the most amazing CG can be made with it.
2008-12-11T11:49:00.000Z	almark		I am having a problem with Blender lets say all the new versions to work with my ati card in linux it just crashes the computer hard what can I do?
2008-12-11T11:50:00.000Z	almark		:Severian  go to blender.org for the tutorial is is hugh I mean hugh, and try blendernation.org or com blenderunderground.com blendernewbies.com
2008-12-11T11:51:00.000Z	almark		:Severian  go to blender.org gnome.com or look for that lots of video tuts, there is so much stuff on it you can't miss it. Gimp is harder to find help though
2008-12-11T11:51:00.000Z	almark		:Severian  welcome, I just hope you can find them just google them prob work ;)
2008-12-11T11:52:00.000Z	almark		Why does my ati card freez my computer with its DRI working when I use Blender if anyone knows the answer it will be greatly appreciated
2008-12-11T11:53:00.000Z	scunizi	almark	do you have effects running? like compiz.. turn them off as a test
2008-12-11T11:54:00.000Z	almark	scunizi	thanks for the answer, I dont think so but glxgears work
2008-12-11T11:54:00.000Z	almark	scunizi	I don't have compiz atm I will later prob
2008-12-11T11:55:00.000Z	scunizi	almark	sorry I'm out of ideas. maybe a larger swap file? or low memory problem... processor old?
2008-12-11T11:55:00.000Z	almark	scunizi	It does this in Gentoo too so I know its my ati card or the fast that xfree is to new for my card, and the computer just freezes hard, I have to press the pwr button in just to hard boot the thing
2008-12-11T11:56:00.000Z	almark	scunizi	its the DRI module that does it, If I disable it in Gentoo it works but slower and no problems, I have a P4 3ghz runnning ram 1gb
2008-12-11T11:57:00.000Z	scunizi	almark	not having used ati, I'm at a loss .. 1gb might be low depending on the graphic.
2008-12-11T11:59:00.000Z	almark	scunizi	we all know that what doesn't work in Linux will in windows, but it works fine in windows because the drivers for ati are in windows. But the ones that are in Ubuntu and Gentoo are either to new or something else I can't remidy, opengl works in linux  Ubuntu so I don't know what to do
2008-12-11T12:00:00.000Z	almark	scunizi	I'll try the blender channel maybe they can shed some light on this
2008-12-11T12:00:00.000Z	scunizi	almark	have you checked ati for any newer drivers .. I seem to remember that they just recently released something new.. a driver or catalyst or something.
2008-12-11T12:03:00.000Z	almark	scunizi	Catalyst is what windows uses for Ati, yet ppl keep telling me the new ati drives do not support my card
