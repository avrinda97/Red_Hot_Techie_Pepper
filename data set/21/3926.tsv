2009-01-14T12:04:00.000Z	Omoikane__	kranny	it seems to be tied to the bookmarks or profile in firefox. If I add enough bookmarks the title bar disappears and the program flashes every time I do something.
2009-01-14T12:05:00.000Z	Omoikane__	kranny	you ever hear of something like that?
2009-01-14T12:07:00.000Z	Omoikane__	kranny	looking for the version now. Not sure where to look.
2009-01-14T12:08:00.000Z	Omoikane__	kranny	3.0.5
2009-01-14T12:09:00.000Z	Omoikane__	kranny	what was that?
2009-01-14T12:11:00.000Z	Omoikane__	kranny	what does f11 do?
2009-01-14T12:12:00.000Z	Omoikane__	kranny	yes
2009-01-14T12:14:00.000Z	Omoikane__	kranny	thank you. do you know anything media buttons? like mute buttons on a laptop? I installed ibex and my mute button stopped working.
2009-01-14T12:17:00.000Z	Omoikane__	kranny	dell inspiron 1525
2009-01-14T12:19:00.000Z	Omoikane__	kranny	how do make sure?
2009-01-14T12:20:00.000Z	Omoikane__	kranny	I have it set to auto detect
2009-01-14T12:24:00.000Z	Omoikane__	kranny	it does have the correct device selected and the correct button is set to the correct function.
2009-01-14T12:27:00.000Z	Omoikane__	kranny	it's weird because it was working before when I had hardy and once I installed ibex it stopped working.
2009-01-14T12:49:00.000Z	Omoikane__	kranny	the interesting thing is that the mute image doesn't flash up. That means that it's not getting through somewhere.
