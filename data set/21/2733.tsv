2010-11-20T06:16:00.000Z	yxz97		Hello
2010-11-20T06:16:00.000Z	yxz97		does anyone here is official support?
2010-11-20T06:16:00.000Z	yxz97		well i have a simple request
2010-11-20T06:17:00.000Z	yxz97		why the hell is not the torrent for version 10.10 here http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/downloadmirrors#dvd
2010-11-20T06:18:00.000Z	yxz97		both
2010-11-20T06:19:00.000Z	rww	yxz97	Erm, it is. That page links to mirrors like (once you select version) http://mirror.mcs.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu-iso/DVDs/ubuntu/10.10/release/ , which have .torrent links
2010-11-20T06:22:00.000Z	rww	yxz97	I don't know if there's a language barrier here, but adding "hell" to random sentences isn't necessary or nice.
2010-11-20T06:22:00.000Z	yxz97	rww	I don't know if there is a language missunderstaning with you, but I said hell just because...
2010-11-20T06:23:00.000Z	yxz97	rww	just because .....
2010-11-20T06:23:00.000Z	yxz97	rww	without intention at alll...
2010-11-20T06:23:00.000Z	rww	yxz97	Then don't. It's making your attitude seem problematic :(
2010-11-20T06:24:00.000Z	yxz97	rww	why?
2010-11-20T06:25:00.000Z	yxz97	rww	your semantic is not my aim ;-)
2010-11-20T06:26:00.000Z	rww	yxz97	being polite isn't unreasonable.
2010-11-20T06:27:00.000Z	yxz97	rww	L
2010-11-20T06:31:00.000Z	rww	yxz97	because 10.04 is a Long Term Support release
2010-11-20T06:32:00.000Z	yxz97	rww	are you engineer or just programmer?
2010-11-20T06:32:00.000Z	rww	yxz97	6.06, 8.04, and 10.04 are LTSes. They're generally spaced every two years.
2010-11-21T09:15:00.000Z	rww	yxz97	That's not what !language is for.
2011-01-07T05:13:00.000Z	rww	yxz97	15GB, per https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements
2011-01-07T05:14:00.000Z	rww	yxz97	20GB is plenty. I've used 5GB for a VM and had it still work.
