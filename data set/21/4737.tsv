2009-01-25T15:29:00.000Z	cristi	jim_p	i also installed xserver-xgl, however i think it wasn't such a good idea. Is it ok to remove it now?
2009-01-25T15:30:00.000Z	cristi	jim_p	You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver. Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server.
