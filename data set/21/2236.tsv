2012-01-12T23:37:00.000Z	ssta	iceroot	maybe apt-cache showpkg, which gives all the reverse-dependencies might shed some light?
2012-01-12T23:40:00.000Z	iceroot	ssta	thank you i will have a look at it
2012-02-02T23:05:00.000Z	iceroot	ssta	because its allowed
2012-02-02T23:06:00.000Z	ssta	iceroot	well, yes.  so are lots of things.  Doesn't make them a good idea
2012-02-02T23:06:00.000Z	iceroot	ssta	why on earth would you put a white space in a filename?
2012-02-02T23:06:00.000Z	ssta	iceroot	anyway, ls and wc are both performing as documented there
2012-02-02T23:06:00.000Z	ssta	iceroot	I wouldn't
2012-02-02T23:07:00.000Z	iceroot	ssta	and because there are strange specialcases there a good ways (for a in ./*) and bad ways (ls | do something)
2012-02-02T23:09:00.000Z	ssta	iceroot	for x in... type constructs break on files with any whitespace...
2012-02-02T23:09:00.000Z	iceroot	ssta	quote
2012-02-02T23:10:00.000Z	iceroot	ssta	for a in ./* do echo "$a" done    there are never problems with white-spaces in $a when you use "$a"
2012-08-01T12:12:00.000Z	iceroot	ssta	its killall foo   which is killing all instances of foo
2012-08-01T12:13:00.000Z	ssta	iceroot	I know what it is...
2012-08-01T12:14:00.000Z	ssta	iceroot	my point still stands.  killall isn't so much bad practice as it is a dangerous habit
2012-08-01T12:16:00.000Z	iceroot	ssta	the same for rm
2012-08-01T12:16:00.000Z	iceroot	ssta	or any other command
2012-08-01T12:16:00.000Z	ssta	iceroot	wel, rm behaves the same on any system
2012-08-01T12:50:00.000Z	iceroot	ssta	i dont see a single reason where root is needed instead of sudo
2012-08-01T12:50:00.000Z	iceroot	ssta	but if you know one, i am interested
2012-08-01T12:51:00.000Z	ssta	iceroot	ry moving /home to a different partition...
2012-08-01T12:51:00.000Z	iceroot	ssta	sudo dd
