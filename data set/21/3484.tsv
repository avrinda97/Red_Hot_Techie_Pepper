2009-03-07T15:54:00.000Z	Mpole	b1n42y	that link assumes that i am already on 8.04. the route is long but worthwhile. i need to go to 7.10, then 8.04 then 8.10

2009-03-07T15:54:00.000Z	Mpole	b1n42y	am currently having problems going to 7.10. how do i do that from the terminal?
2009-03-07T15:55:00.000Z	b1n42y	Mpole	In my opinion backup your docs and do fresh install
2009-03-07T15:55:00.000Z	Mpole	b1n42y	i guess i should download the 8.10 ISO, right?
2009-03-07T15:56:00.000Z	Mpole	b1n42y	this laptop has a dual OS... Windows XP and Ubuntu. If i install a fresh 8.10 distro, will the WinXP be removed or the 7.10 will be simply upgraded?
2009-03-07T15:58:00.000Z	b1n42y	Mpole	hmmm, well where it installs depends on which partitions you choose, however im not sure about grub, best read
2009-03-07T16:21:00.000Z	Mpole	b1n42y	One last question. The Mozilla-Thunderbird email client is in the form of a .tar file. Where are the installations instructions for it>?
2009-03-07T16:22:00.000Z	b1n42y	Mpole	i think it install by deafult on 8.10
2009-03-07T16:22:00.000Z	b1n42y	Mpole	that is i have it and i dont remember installing it
2009-03-07T16:23:00.000Z	Mpole	b1n42y	ok. lemme google then. lol
2009-03-07T16:23:00.000Z	b1n42y	Mpole	there you go lol
