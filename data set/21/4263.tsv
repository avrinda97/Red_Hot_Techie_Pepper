2008-07-21T22:55:00.000Z	glitsj16	Anarhist	check the "about:plugins" url in firefox to get the version number for flash
2008-07-21T22:57:00.000Z	glitsj16	Anarhist	many people have had the sound-hijacking issue, like Dein suggests, upgrading to flash player 10 beta usually fixes this
2008-07-21T22:58:00.000Z	Anarhist	glitsj16	can i do that with apt-get or do i have to uninstall it there, and the do manual install?
2008-07-21T22:59:00.000Z	glitsj16	Anarhist	you will have to get the flash 10 beta from adobe's site (get the tarball) .. i would suggest leaving the flash 9 there for a minute, it woill make life easier whin installing the beta, if you want, we'll guide you through
2008-07-21T23:00:00.000Z	Anarhist	glitsj16	i'll try it on my own, i'll be back if i have some serious problems
2008-07-21T23:00:00.000Z	glitsj16	Anarhist	no problem
2008-07-21T23:01:00.000Z	glitsj16	Anarhist	just get the correct path where your firefox picks up the libflashplayer.so while you still have one, and use that to drop the new one in later and you'll be fine
2008-07-21T23:15:00.000Z	glitsj16	Anarhist	and check https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PulseAudio too, there's a section for known issues with flash/firefox and pulseaudio
2008-07-21T23:08:00.000Z	glitsj16	Anarhist	it always does that, try wget http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/flashplayer10/flashplayer10_install_linux_070208.tar.gz
2008-07-21T23:09:00.000Z	Anarhist	glitsj16	just got it, hopefully put everything in the right place
2008-07-21T23:09:00.000Z	glitsj16	Anarhist	okay, hope it improves your issue
2008-07-21T23:10:00.000Z	Anarhist	glitsj16	vlc give out sound when playing files, but flash doesn't
2008-07-21T23:11:00.000Z	glitsj16	Anarhist	do you use pulseaudio ?
2008-07-21T23:11:00.000Z	Anarhist	glitsj16	how do i check?
2008-07-21T23:12:00.000Z	glitsj16	Anarhist	no pulseaudio like ALSA is a system wide sound system
2008-07-21T23:12:00.000Z	Anarhist	glitsj16	i know, but i have also-utils in my init.d and pulseaudio
2008-07-21T23:13:00.000Z	glitsj16	Anarhist	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4928900 has some things you can look into getting flash and pulseaudio to play nice
2008-07-21T23:15:00.000Z	Anarhist	glitsj16	i think i'll deal with that later, i'm going to bookmark these for now... don't really have that much time on my hands at the moment. Thanks a lot though
2008-07-21T23:16:00.000Z	glitsj16	Anarhist	no problem, it's indeed something you'd want to do without time-pressure, goodluck :)
