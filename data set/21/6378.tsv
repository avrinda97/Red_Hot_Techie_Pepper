2007-04-15T12:42:00.000Z	TimonUbuntu		Can anybody please recommend a good firewall?
2007-04-15T12:43:00.000Z	draeath	TimonUbuntu	man iptables
2007-04-15T12:43:00.000Z	draeath	TimonUbuntu	built-in
2007-04-15T12:43:00.000Z	TimonUbuntu		cheers
2007-04-15T12:46:00.000Z	TimonUbuntu	draeath	, what sort of set up does iptables have as default? does it filter troublesome/high risk ports by default?
2007-04-15T12:46:00.000Z	draeath	TimonUbuntu	completely open by default
2007-04-15T12:46:00.000Z	TimonUbuntu	draeath	thanks mate. i'm reading the man pages now
2007-04-15T12:47:00.000Z	draeath	TimonUbuntu	http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Firewall-HOWTO.html
2007-04-15T12:47:00.000Z	TimonUbuntu		my gaim won't even send messages. I can recieve messages but nobody can recieve mine
2007-04-15T12:47:00.000Z	TimonUbuntu	draeath	Thanks, checking it out now
2007-04-15T12:47:00.000Z	draeath	TimonUbuntu	much better than what I could do. I actually don't have firewalls inside my network
2007-04-15T12:48:00.000Z	draeath	TimonUbuntu	wait, that doc is old
2007-04-15T12:48:00.000Z	TimonUbuntu	draeath	, I've got a moderately tight firewall on my router, should that be enough?

2007-04-15T12:49:00.000Z	draeath	TimonUbuntu	as tight as you can get it. Make sure you cant reconfigure the router from the internet.
2007-04-15T12:49:00.000Z	draeath	TimonUbuntu	wireless?
2007-04-15T12:49:00.000Z	TimonUbuntu	draeath	yes, wireless
2007-04-15T12:49:00.000Z	TimonUbuntu	draeath	i had some problems getting it perfected with ubuntu, but all is good now
2007-04-15T12:49:00.000Z	draeath	TimonUbuntu	make sure you are using WPA (WEP might as well be nothing, if you are keeping attackers out)
2007-04-15T12:50:00.000Z	TimonUbuntu	draeath	, i know what you mean, it takes about 20 minutes to crack WEP now
2007-04-15T12:50:00.000Z	TimonUbuntu	draeath	, I had a look at aircrack-ng , unfortunately i couldnt see how long it took because my wifi drivers dont support injection as yet
