2007-07-31T14:42:00.000Z	TTilus	me_	there is SATA with one disk and IDE with no devices
2007-07-31T14:43:00.000Z	TTilus	me_	dunno what it _really_ means, but i'd say it just does not have any devices attached
2007-07-31T14:44:00.000Z	TTilus	me_	you _have_ a dvd drive?
2007-07-31T14:44:00.000Z	TTilus	me_	has it ever worked?
2007-07-31T14:45:00.000Z	TTilus	me_	if the dvd _has_ worked, where?
2007-07-31T14:45:00.000Z	TTilus	me_	whoa, if you managed to install, then its definitely working, what happens if you insert cd or dvd?
2007-07-31T14:47:00.000Z	TTilus	me_	what happens if you insert cd or dvd?
2007-07-31T14:48:00.000Z	TTilus	me_	 do you have any /dev/hd* devices?
2007-07-31T14:49:00.000Z	TTilus	me_	do you _have_ any /dev/hd* devices?

2007-07-31T15:00:00.000Z	TTilus	me_	when i compare to mine, you seem to be lacking modules cdrom and ide_cd
2007-07-31T15:02:00.000Z	TTilus	me_	which means it was a success
2007-07-31T15:02:00.000Z	TTilus	me_	now $ lsmod | grep ide
2007-07-31T15:02:00.000Z	TTilus	me_	see anything?
