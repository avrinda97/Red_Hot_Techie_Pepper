2007-10-19T01:11:00.000Z	Evanlec	Sp0tUb	do 'sudo mount <device> <target>'
2007-10-19T01:12:00.000Z	Sp0tUb	Evanlec	Maybe asking stupid, but where do i see what device it is and the target? :-)
2007-10-19T01:13:00.000Z	Evanlec	Sp0tUb	the target is just whatever directory u want to mount it to, such as /media/disk, to find the device try 'sudo fdisk -l'
2007-10-19T01:13:00.000Z	Sp0tUb	Evanlec	sudo fdisk -l ?
