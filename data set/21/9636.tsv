2005-08-10T14:49:00.000Z	bimberi	tlord___	are you using the account you created during install?
2005-08-10T14:49:00.000Z	tlord___	bimberi	yup.
2005-08-10T14:49:00.000Z	tlord___		It worked fine for quite some time :)
2005-08-10T14:50:00.000Z	tlord___		But about a month ago went crazy.
2005-08-10T14:51:00.000Z	tlord___	bimberi	I've been busy (and low on bandwidth) in that time, figured I would just burn the live CD iso and boot into it, then see if that let me edit appropriate files, but ... I can't even get it to boot from the Live CD now. (This is on an iBook; I hold down D at boot to force it to boot from the optical drive, but it's not working ...)
2005-08-10T14:52:00.000Z	bimberi	tlord___	hm - i was about to suggest booting from the livecd too :)
2005-08-10T14:53:00.000Z	bimberi	tlord___	open a terminal and type "groups", do you see an "admin" group in the list?
2005-08-10T14:54:00.000Z	tlord___	bimberi	hold a sec :)
2005-08-10T14:54:00.000Z	tlord___	bimberi	Yes, "admin" is there.
2005-08-10T14:57:00.000Z	bimberi	tlord___	You'll need to boot to recovery mode (for superuser access) and check the file /etc/sudoers
2005-08-10T14:57:00.000Z	tlord___		how do I boot to recovery mode?
2005-08-10T14:57:00.000Z	tlord___	bimberi	how do I boot to recovery mode? :)
2005-08-10T14:57:00.000Z	tlord___		Ah, thanks.
2005-08-10T14:57:00.000Z	tlord___		when I check that file, what might I then do?
2005-08-10T14:58:00.000Z	bimberi	tlord___	it should be a boot option in grub when booting (note - i don't know PPC well though)
2005-08-10T14:59:00.000Z	tlord___	bimberi	much appreciated! I will play a bit. First, I'm copying off what I can from the hard disk; I *can* mount an external disk (no su password required) and transfer off my various artifacts.
2005-08-10T14:59:00.000Z	tlord___		I may be back on later, but not tonight ;)
2005-08-10T14:59:00.000Z	bimberi	tlord___	I the following line in /etc/sudoers:
2005-08-10T15:00:00.000Z	bimberi	tlord___	dave    ALL=(ALL) ALL
2005-08-10T15:00:00.000Z	bimberi	tlord___	(where "dave" is my username)
2005-08-10T15:00:00.000Z	bimberi	tlord___	you should have something similar
