2005-12-20T09:06:00.000Z	ajulius		how do i scan my ports in linux?
2005-12-20T09:06:00.000Z	ajulius		to see whos using my active ports
2005-12-20T09:07:00.000Z	sethk	ajulius	netstat -a
2005-12-20T09:07:00.000Z	ajulius	sethk	thanks, also how do i get firewall ips? i assume ubuntu has a firewall active?
2005-12-20T09:07:00.000Z	ajulius	sethk	or does ubuntu come with firewall off by default?
2005-12-20T09:07:00.000Z	sethk	ajulius	I'm not sure, I don't use fake firewalls.
2005-12-20T09:08:00.000Z	ajulius		whos using a fake firewall
2005-12-20T09:08:00.000Z	sethk	ajulius	iptables -l will show you what filtering is enabled
2005-12-20T09:08:00.000Z	ajulius		whatever comes in ubuntu i mean
2005-12-20T09:08:00.000Z	sethk	ajulius	anyone who thinks a firewall is software configuration rather than a separate machine.  :)
2005-12-20T09:08:00.000Z	sethk	ajulius	IP filtering is not a firewall.  But the abuse of the language has, alas, become pervasive
2005-12-20T09:09:00.000Z	sethk	ajulius	which is not to say that ip filtering isn't a good thing.  and iptables is an excellent ip filter.  iptables running on a separate machine, with some proxies, makes an excellent firewall
2005-12-20T09:10:00.000Z	ajulius		needed to use sudo
2005-12-20T09:10:00.000Z	ajulius		for iptables
2005-12-20T09:10:00.000Z	ajulius		but it says nothing
2005-12-20T09:10:00.000Z	ajulius		hmm
2005-12-20T09:10:00.000Z	ajulius		so ubuntu doesnt have a firewall on by default?
2005-12-20T09:11:00.000Z	sethk	ajulius	I believe you have to install and configure it
2005-12-20T09:12:00.000Z	ajulius	sethk	yeah firestarter
2005-12-20T09:12:00.000Z	ajulius	sethk	so with linux its fine to have no firewall?
2005-12-20T09:12:00.000Z	ajulius	sethk	 See with windows its a necessity to have a firewall
