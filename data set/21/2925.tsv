2009-05-15T01:30:00.000Z	danno67		need some help mounting an Iphone and browsing it
2009-05-15T01:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	danno67	An un-jailbroken iphone can't be mounted
2009-05-15T01:31:00.000Z	danno67	Jordan_U	I can mount it under regular Ubuntu just fine
2009-05-15T01:31:00.000Z	danno67	Jordan_U	and yes it jailbroken
2009-05-15T01:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	danno67	What is the problem?
2009-05-15T01:32:00.000Z	danno67	Jordan_U	I am using Crunchbang, an Ubuntu fork. its not mounting automatically. is there some sort of app that I need to install to mount it. Other USB stuff works ok
2009-05-15T01:34:00.000Z	danno67	Jordan_U	still there?
2009-05-15T01:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	danno67	Yes, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPhone for instructions on how to mount an iphone
2009-05-15T01:36:00.000Z	danno67	Jordan_U	will take a look at it...
2009-05-15T01:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	danno67	page up
2009-05-15T01:43:00.000Z	danno67	Jordan_U	hmm, that document is helpful but still doesn't answer my question specifically. Let me put it another way.
2009-05-15T01:44:00.000Z	danno67	Jordan_U	if I have a device showing up on lsusb but not in fdisk -l why would that be???
2009-05-15T01:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	danno67	The iphone is not an external disk, unlike pretty much every other MP3 player on the planet it uses a proprietary protocall ( over tcp/ip I think, don't remember the details ) so it is NOT a block device
2009-05-15T01:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	danno67	File transfer to an iphone is closer to file transfer to a NAS than an external USB drive
2009-05-15T01:47:00.000Z	danno67	Jordan_U	hmm, I just can't figure out why it would mount under my full blown Jaunty install but not under my minimal Crunchbang install. There has gotta be something I am missing
2009-05-15T01:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	danno67	Did you install ipod-convienience like the instructions say?
2009-05-15T01:48:00.000Z	danno67	Jordan_U	Is that part of Jaunty, because I didn't install that under Jaunty and I can still see my Iphone
2009-05-15T01:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	danno67	I don't know
2009-05-15T01:51:00.000Z	danno67	Jordan_U	never mind...I will just wait until I can get to my regular computer. Its going to be tied up for hours while it tries to recover some data off an NTFS drive. I guess I will wait until it finishes.
2009-05-15T01:51:00.000Z	danno67	Jordan_U	but thanks for the help.
