2010-06-24T15:16:00.000Z	jkalex05		unfortunately no
2010-06-24T15:17:00.000Z	jkalex05		whats the next question
2010-06-24T15:17:00.000Z	jkalex05		joshmuffin the problem is you have grub2
2010-06-24T15:17:00.000Z	jkalex05		use grub
2010-06-24T15:18:00.000Z	jkalex05		cocaine is a hell of a drug
2010-06-24T15:18:00.000Z	jkalex05		i uninstalled grub2 and put on grub on lucid
2010-06-24T15:19:00.000Z	jkalex05		its probably a driver
2010-06-24T15:20:00.000Z	jkalex05		reformat and install
2010-06-24T15:20:00.000Z	jkalex05		linux isnt like windows you cant just do a restore to yesterday if you fux it up
2010-06-24T15:20:00.000Z	ddilinger	jkalex05	depends on the backups you keep :P
2010-06-24T15:21:00.000Z	jkalex05		basically he raped his os in the ass
2010-06-24T15:21:00.000Z	ddilinger	jkalex05	a copy of /etc along with dpkg --get-selections and you can pretty much get it all back(not counting user settings)
2010-06-24T15:21:00.000Z	jkalex05		and now it wont boot
2010-06-24T15:21:00.000Z	jkalex05		not if you cant load
