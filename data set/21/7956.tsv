2007-03-26T15:08:00.000Z	Apoc		hello?
2007-03-26T15:09:00.000Z	Apoc		ok, can anyone give me a hand with some extremely minor noobish questions?
2007-03-26T15:10:00.000Z	Apoc		a'ight, i'm just curious how i access a different hard drive
2007-03-26T15:10:00.000Z	Apoc		ok?
2007-03-26T15:10:00.000Z	jrib	Apoc	what filesystem?
2007-03-26T15:15:00.000Z	Apoc	jrib	the script tells me there are no useable partitions found
2007-03-26T15:15:00.000Z	jrib	Apoc	pastebin the output of 'sudo fdisk -l'
2007-03-26T15:26:00.000Z	jrib	Apoc	hmm I don't see any other partitions on there
2007-03-26T15:26:00.000Z	jrib	Apoc	where do you believe it is supposed to be?
2007-03-26T15:26:00.000Z	Apoc	jrib	don't have a clue, i just started using Ubuntu today, got sick of windows
2007-03-26T15:26:00.000Z	jrib	Apoc	are you still able to boot into windows (by selecting it at the grub menu)?  Also, do you have more than one hard drive?
2007-03-26T15:27:00.000Z	Apoc	jrib	i wiped windows out after backing up my files onto the NTFS PATA harddrive, and installed ubuntu onto a 200gb SATA hard drive
2007-03-26T15:28:00.000Z	jrib	Apoc	I see, so ubuntu isn't seeing that second hard drive at all
2007-03-26T15:28:00.000Z	Apoc	jrib	not at all apparently
2007-03-26T15:28:00.000Z	Apoc	jrib	would it make a difference that the second drive is on IDE and the one ubuntu is installed on is SATA?
2007-03-26T15:29:00.000Z	jrib	Apoc	there have been some issues with that recently... does it use jmicron?
2007-03-26T15:29:00.000Z	Apoc	jrib	don't have a clue
2007-03-26T15:30:00.000Z	jrib	Apoc	what chipset on the mobo?
2007-03-26T15:31:00.000Z	Apoc	jrib	Nvidia nforce 4 SLI
2007-03-26T15:32:00.000Z	jrib	Apoc	well it sounds like this https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/57502 even if we are not sure that your mobo uses the jmicron controller.  Maybe someone else here has more info about that
2007-03-26T15:34:00.000Z	Apoc	jrib	ubuntu recognizes my PATA optical drives though
