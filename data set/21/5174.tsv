2011-03-13T03:31:00.000Z	soreau	aroman	Find the entry you don't want and uncheck it there
2011-03-13T03:31:00.000Z	aroman	soreau	any idea how to do that from terminal?

2011-03-24T06:54:00.000Z	soreau	aroman	chown the directory to your user again?
2011-03-24T06:55:00.000Z	soreau	aroman	What is the directory you're in? Use 'sudo chown -R $USER /path/to/src/dir/' as your normal user
2011-03-24T06:56:00.000Z	aroman	soreau	oh I see now
2011-03-24T06:56:00.000Z	soreau	aroman	I am hoping you will ;)
2011-03-24T06:56:00.000Z	aroman	soreau	ls -lah reveals all
2011-03-24T06:57:00.000Z	soreau	aroman	As you normal user: sudo chown -r $USER $HOME
2011-03-24T06:57:00.000Z	soreau	aroman	As you normal user: sudo chown -R $USER $HOME
2011-03-24T06:58:00.000Z	aroman	soreau	oh, it's more root owned stuff
2011-03-24T06:58:00.000Z	soreau	aroman	As your normal user: sudo chown -R $USER $HOME
2011-03-24T07:01:00.000Z	soreau	aroman	General rule of thumb: you should be able to compile anything as user (provided the user owns the src dir) but should use root when installing (to a perfix the user doesnt own, like standard /usr )
