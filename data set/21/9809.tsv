2005-07-06T12:39:00.000Z	GuBA|off		Hello, i have a problem --> I cannot mount the diskettes on Hoary
2005-07-06T12:39:00.000Z	GuBA|off		some idea of what it can be?
2005-07-06T12:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	GuBA|off	you mean 3.5 inch or 5.25 inch diskettes? what error do you get when mounting?
2005-07-06T12:46:00.000Z	GuBA|off	HappyFool	3.5 --> Unable to mount the selected volume.
2005-07-06T12:46:00.000Z	GuBA|off	HappyFool	--> mount: I could not determine the filesystem type, and none was specified
2005-07-06T12:48:00.000Z	GuBA|off	HappyFool	I have 90 machines with Hoary and everything presents the problem
2005-07-06T12:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	GuBA|off	hrm. are you sure the disk is ok?
2005-07-06T12:49:00.000Z	GuBA|off	HappyFool	completely, they are new discs, I have proven more than 20 discs
2005-07-06T12:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	GuBA|off	have they been formatted yet?
2005-07-06T12:51:00.000Z	GuBA|off	HappyFool	yes, the majority has been formatted in GuiDOuS , is a College ...
2005-07-06T12:51:00.000Z	GuBA|off	HappyFool	many of the users still use that system (Win)
2005-07-06T12:51:00.000Z	GuBA|off	HappyFool	Window$
2005-07-06T12:53:00.000Z	GuBA|off	HappyFool	before we had Debian Sarge and FC-2 and worked without problems discs
2005-07-06T12:53:00.000Z	HappyFool	GuBA|off	try 'sudo mount -t vfat /dev/fd0 /media/floppy0'  (assuming that /media/floppy0 exists)
2005-07-06T12:55:00.000Z	GuBA|off	HappyFool	of that way if he works, but the users are not very capable for the handling of the terminal,
2005-07-06T12:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	GuBA|off	hrm, sorry. i don't use diskettes, i don't know what the problem is
2005-07-06T12:56:00.000Z	GuBA|off	HappyFool	I need that the users can mount discs through the graphical surroundings
2005-07-06T12:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	GuBA|off	you can take a look at the 'mtools' package - it provides dos-like copy/directory listing commands
2005-07-06T12:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	GuBA|off	sorry, i don't have a solution for that
2005-07-06T12:57:00.000Z	GuBA|off	HappyFool	ok. thx ... where I can report that error?
2005-07-06T12:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	GuBA|off	you can try bugzilla.ubuntu.com
