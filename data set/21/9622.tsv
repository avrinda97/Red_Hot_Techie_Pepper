2005-08-12T09:49:00.000Z	Subfix		When Ubuntu is loading I get this error scrolling like 8 times:  modprobe : FAILED : could not load /lib/modules/2.6.11-6mdk/modules.deb no such file or directory          could this be why my USB mouse isn't working? ...what exactly is it anyways?
2005-08-12T09:50:00.000Z	Doomhammer	Subfix	yea, that's probobly it... those are kernel modules that it isn't loading, similar to "drivers" for WinBlows
2005-08-12T09:50:00.000Z	Subfix	Doomhammer	Ah, I thought they had to do with drivers... I've installed it twice and had the same error... is there a way to download modules.deb alone so I can stick it in?
2005-08-12T09:51:00.000Z	Doomhammer	Subfix	hmm, not that I know of :/
2005-08-12T09:51:00.000Z	Subfix		crikey
2005-08-12T09:51:00.000Z	Subfix	Doomhammer	out on a limb here, but do you think you could supply it? ....
2005-08-12T09:52:00.000Z	Doomhammer	Subfix	sure, i'll look if I have one... but it might screw you up -- you're on x86 right?
2005-08-12T09:52:00.000Z	Subfix	Doomhammer	yeah I am, but hey it's worth a shot :D
2005-08-12T09:53:00.000Z	Doomhammer	Subfix	hmm, that dir doesn't exist... you're on ubuntu right ? :S
2005-08-12T09:53:00.000Z	Subfix	Doomhammer	indeed, latest one too.. just d/led the ISO off the main site about 2 days ago
2005-08-12T09:54:00.000Z	Doomhammer	Subfix	well mine definately won't work, we're using different versions of the kernel... i have 2.6.10 but you have 2.6.11
2005-08-12T09:54:00.000Z	Subfix	Doomhammer	i see. thanks for the attempt..
2005-08-12T09:54:00.000Z	Doomhammer	Subfix	np, i'm sure someone else has a 2.6.11 kernel if you want to try :/
2005-08-12T09:56:00.000Z	Subfix	Doomhammer	I just mounted the ubunto drive to mandriva and searched and found modules.deb in /lib/modules/2.6.10-5-386    ...does that mean anything to you? :P
2005-08-12T09:56:00.000Z	Doomhammer	Subfix	you found modules.deb on the ubuntu system, or the mandriva system?
2005-08-12T09:57:00.000Z	Subfix	Doomhammer	ubuntu... but wait. it's .dep ...wtf is .dep? ...
2005-08-12T09:57:00.000Z	Doomhammer	Subfix	LOL! no idea, but a .deb is a package -- whe you apt-get something, it downloads the .deb and isntalls it
2005-08-12T09:57:00.000Z	Subfix	Doomhammer	yeah. this is weird :(
2005-08-12T09:59:00.000Z	Subfix	Doomhammer	is .ko a driver file?
2005-08-12T09:59:00.000Z	Doomhammer	Subfix	yea, that's a kernel module... same with .so and .o
2005-08-12T09:59:00.000Z	Subfix	Doomhammer	ok. modules.dep is a text files full of paths to .ko files etc.
