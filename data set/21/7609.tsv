2006-09-11T15:13:00.000Z	lupine_85		no, unrar and unrar-nonfree for that
2006-09-11T15:14:00.000Z	lupine_85		(unrar won't do more recent .rar files, most specifically those with passwords)
2006-09-11T15:15:00.000Z	Adam	lupine_85	will the p7-zip do a good job unraring?  or should I get a different package?  I have a lot of recent RAR backups.
2006-09-11T15:17:00.000Z	lupine_85	Adam	unrar
2006-09-11T15:17:00.000Z	Adam	lupine_85	I installed the former (the later gives me the same problem)
2006-09-11T15:18:00.000Z	lupine_85	Adam	strange. Presumably it doesn't know about "unrar-nonfree" the binary
2006-09-11T15:19:00.000Z	Adam	lupine_85	what does it even install :)
2006-09-11T15:19:00.000Z	Adam	lupine_85	I installed it, I don't even know where the binary is.
2006-09-11T15:25:00.000Z	Adam	lupine_85	yeah, I've been looking for a replacement for Skype just so I won't have to do that :)
2006-09-11T15:26:00.000Z	Adam	lupine_85	too bad both don't have Win32 version
2006-09-11T15:27:00.000Z	Adam	lupine_85	really?  btw, what makes it "best"?
2006-09-11T15:28:00.000Z	Adam	lupine_85	how's the speech quality?
2006-09-11T15:28:00.000Z	Adam	lupine_85	http://www.gnomemeeting.org/index.php?rub=5 -> "windows    * No files available yet." :(
2006-09-11T15:30:00.000Z	lupine_85	Adam	depends on the codec. Pretty good generally
2006-09-11T15:31:00.000Z	Adam	lupine_85	cool, I hope I can get my friends to use it.
2006-09-11T15:32:00.000Z	lupine_85	Adam	since it's SIP, there's a load of different clients they could use
2006-09-11T15:33:00.000Z	lupine_85	Adam	you can even get hardware (ATAs) that you plug into your router; a normal phone plugs into that, and you can make calls as usual
2006-09-11T15:34:00.000Z	Adam	lupine_85	interesting. btw, there's a rumor Skypw will never be available for 64 as it is too tightly coupled with some 32bit-only libraries
2006-09-11T15:35:00.000Z	lupine_85	Adam	doubtful - most of the world will be 64-bit in a few years
2006-09-11T15:35:00.000Z	Adam	lupine_85	yeah, the same rumor claims Skype (in its current state) is doomed :)
