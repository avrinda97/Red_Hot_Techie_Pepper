2009-11-07T20:17:00.000Z	Xpistos		Is it possible to change the login screen in 9.10?
2009-11-07T20:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Xpistos	GDM 2  can't be themed like the old one,  if you want themses you can try KDM instead
2009-11-07T20:18:00.000Z	Xpistos	sebsebseb	was that an ubuntu limitation of gnome?
2009-11-07T20:18:00.000Z	Xpistos	sebsebseb	or a gnome limitation
2009-11-07T20:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Xpistos	No with  GDM 2  the  developers are happy since they have cleaner code to  maintain, but  quite a lot of users want themes like the old one
2009-11-07T20:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Xpistos	There is a way to change icons and colours and that's it
2009-11-07T20:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Xpistos	unless you edit source code or something
2009-11-08T08:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Xpistos	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2009-11-08T08:45:00.000Z	Xpistos	sebsebseb	I have it
2009-11-08T08:45:00.000Z	Xpistos	sebsebseb	do you have ffmpeg installed>
2009-11-08T08:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Xpistos	don't think so
2009-11-08T08:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Xpistos	not sure if I ran restricted extras command for this install, but  should be able to play AVI after running that
2009-11-08T08:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Xpistos	ok
2009-11-08T08:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Xpistos	by the way good idea to md5sum ISO's before burning their contents to CD,  and checking  the code matches
2009-11-08T08:50:00.000Z	Xpistos	sebsebseb	Thanks I got that. Besides I want to install fresh from the 9.10 release and not the beta and update. I want to see the nice pictures on the install
2009-11-08T08:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Xpistos	Well do what I just said then
2009-11-08T08:50:00.000Z	Xpistos	sebsebseb	I am checking the iso I have now
2009-11-08T08:51:00.000Z	Xpistos	sebsebseb	or as soon as I find it
2009-11-08T08:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Xpistos	http://releases.ubuntu.com/9.10  you can find the code it needs to be in one of those fiels
2009-11-08T08:59:00.000Z	Xpistos	sebsebseb	I will hollar at you later my friend
2009-11-08T09:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Xpistos	I am leaving here soon
