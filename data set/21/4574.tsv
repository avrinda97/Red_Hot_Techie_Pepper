2008-06-01T07:55:00.000Z	yaris12346789		is DSL same as ubuntu in terms of performance and capabilities ?
2008-06-01T07:55:00.000Z	yaris12346789		also does xubuntu come with security stuff like antivirus, firewall ?
2008-06-01T07:56:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yaris12346789	it has a firewall (iptables) but does not have an anticirus nor does it need one
2008-06-01T07:56:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yaris12346789	clamav exists, but it does not need one
2008-06-01T08:31:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yaris12346789	I think so, but you can't install xubuntu on it
2008-06-01T08:32:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yaris12346789	you could use wubi
2008-06-01T10:56:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yaris12346789	is the desktop wired or wireless?
2008-06-01T10:56:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yaris12346789	dhcp?
2008-06-01T10:57:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yaris12346789	is it behind a router?
2008-06-01T10:57:00.000Z	yaris12346789	Starnestommy	yes
2008-06-01T10:57:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yaris12346789	and is it connected to the router by an ethernet cable?

2008-06-01T10:58:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yaris12346789	try running sudo dhclient eth0
2008-06-02T05:14:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yaris12346789	I suspect a problem with xorg.conf
2008-06-02T05:15:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yaris12346789	you probably just need to add a new screen section to xorg.conf
2008-06-02T05:15:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yaris12346789	open /etc/X11/xorg.conf
