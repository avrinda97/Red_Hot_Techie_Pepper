2009-08-24T00:31:00.000Z	mutenewt		im using the standard .profile but scripts in my ~/bin directory are not found.  what am i doing wrong?
2009-08-24T00:32:00.000Z	Flannel	mutenewt	Did you create ~/bin recently?
2009-08-24T00:33:00.000Z	mutenewt	Flannel	why?
2009-08-24T00:33:00.000Z	Flannel	mutenewt	You'd have to create a new terminal before it'll work (or source your profile again)
2009-08-24T00:33:00.000Z	mutenewt	Flannel	understood but thats not the problem, I have had /bin for a while just first time tried running a script from there
2009-08-24T00:34:00.000Z	Flannel	mutenewt	Alright.  So is ~/bin in your path?  What's the path to the script, and what are its permissions?
2009-08-24T00:35:00.000Z	mutenewt	Flannel	not a permission issue (wont work with sudo either).  doesn't find file/directory ...
2009-08-24T00:36:00.000Z	mutenewt	Flannel	 looks like .profile adds it to path if it exists.  no?
2009-08-24T00:36:00.000Z	Flannel	mutenewt	er, not working with sudo doesn't mean it's not a permission issue.
2009-08-24T00:36:00.000Z	Flannel	mutenewt	`echo $PATH` in a terminal and check it see if its there.
2009-08-24T00:37:00.000Z	mutenewt	Flannel	its there
2009-08-24T00:37:00.000Z	Flannel	mutenewt	Alright, and what are the permissions on the script?
2009-08-24T00:38:00.000Z	mutenewt	Flannel	one sec
2009-08-24T00:39:00.000Z	Flannel	mutenewt	(you can just `ls -l ~/bin` and then copy/paste that whole line here)
2009-08-24T00:40:00.000Z	mutenewt	Flannel	rwxr-xr-x 1
2009-08-24T00:42:00.000Z	Flannel	mutenewt	And does that script work when you specify it explicitly? (full path to it?)
2009-08-24T00:42:00.000Z	mutenewt	Flannel	yep
2009-08-24T00:42:00.000Z	Flannel	mutenewt	ie: `/home/me/bin/script`
2009-08-24T00:43:00.000Z	mutenewt	Flannel	yep
2009-08-24T00:45:00.000Z	mutenewt	Flannel	scripts works, path is ok but still wont find it w/o explicitly pointing to file.  :(
2009-08-24T00:56:00.000Z	mutenewt	Flannel	 ill keep look for a solution (confused atm) but if you think of something pls let me know
