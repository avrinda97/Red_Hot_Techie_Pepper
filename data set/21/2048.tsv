2010-02-06T13:55:00.000Z	Gryllida		Hi. Suppose I've installed a STS version of Ubuntu and did some things (for example, installed LyX and changed wallpaper). Then on some date I found that a newer LTS version of Ubuntu is available. Would an update require me to re-install LyX and to change wallpaper again? Or just a reboot, and everything fine?
