2009-08-24T00:07:00.000Z	notwist	mnaines1	15 should be enough if youre just planning on having ubuntu in that space and no videos/whatever
2009-08-24T00:07:00.000Z	mnaines1	notwist	what I plan to do is have nothing but ubuntu and an 8GB swap partition on the boot drive (a 32GB solid-state drive) and using the 150GB drive for extra storage
2009-08-24T00:08:00.000Z	notwist	mnaines1	8 gb swap is a lot unless you have something like 4 gb of RAM
2009-08-24T00:09:00.000Z	notwist	mnaines1	if you have 1x32 and 1x150 I would recommend using 4 gb as swap, the rest for ubuntu and the 150 for data
2009-08-24T00:09:00.000Z	mnaines1	notwist	that I do...My laptop is an Intel Cor2 Duo with 2GB of RAM, but for my birthday I am going to have it upgraded to 4GB of CAS-4 RAM and a 32GB solid-state drive
2009-08-24T00:09:00.000Z	notwist	mnaines1	4 gb swap is fine for 4 gb ram to
2009-08-24T00:10:00.000Z	mnaines1	notwist	I usually have a habit of allocating 2x the RAM as swap space
2009-08-24T00:10:00.000Z	notwist	mnaines1	im not sure but isnt swap only used when ram is full?
2009-08-24T00:10:00.000Z	notwist	mnaines1	any more than 100 % of RAM as swap seems like overkill
2009-08-24T00:11:00.000Z	notwist	mnaines1	oh, well 200 % still seems like a lot
2009-08-24T00:11:00.000Z	notwist	mnaines1	but if you're willing to spend the space go for it :p
2009-08-24T00:12:00.000Z	mnaines1	notwist	the main thing I am going for is using a 150GB Raptor drive as a plug-and-play drive and the 32GB SSD as the internal boot drive
2009-08-24T00:12:00.000Z	notwist	mnaines1	well 2 gb back and forth makes a big difference on a 32 gb drive
2009-08-24T00:12:00.000Z	mnaines1	notwist	what do you know about RAM?
2009-08-24T00:13:00.000Z	mnaines1	notwist	no...My question now is does 4-4-4-12 RAM have any noticeable performance gain over 5-5-5-15 RAM?
2009-08-24T00:14:00.000Z	notwist	mnaines1	i dont think so, usually you dont need to worry too much about RAM performance unless you're a gamer
2009-08-24T00:14:00.000Z	notwist	mnaines1	which i suppose youre not if youre using ubuntu :)
2009-08-24T00:14:00.000Z	mnaines1	notwist	actually, I am a gamer...Warzone2100 and Tremulous are the two games I play on Ubuntu
2009-08-24T00:15:00.000Z	notwist	mnaines1	never heard of them :)
2009-08-24T00:16:00.000Z	notwist	mnaines1	you should still look up customer reviews
2009-08-24T00:16:00.000Z	notwist	mnaines1	before buying any computer parts :)
