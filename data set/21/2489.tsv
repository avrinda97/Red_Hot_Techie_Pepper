2011-11-14T07:09:00.000Z	welder		Ubuntu is a big mess now that Unity is default... it's all locked down where you can't customize anything! How do I change Empathy settings? How do I remove the top bar that wastes my screen space?!? Why is there a global 'Online Accounts' setting that doesn't work yet!???!
2011-11-14T07:10:00.000Z	welder		Ubuntu is no longer the best desktop OS
2011-11-14T07:11:00.000Z	welder		I like the side bar with program icons, but I hate how nothing can be customized anymore
2011-11-14T07:13:00.000Z	|Slacker|	welder	install ccsm and then you can customize unity a bit
2011-11-14T07:14:00.000Z	welder	|Slacker|	i've alredy installed ccsm but there is a huge lack of Unity options
2011-11-14T07:15:00.000Z	|Slacker|	welder	hmmm...I see...
2011-11-14T07:34:00.000Z	|Slacker|	welder	dude, there's an option in empathy preferences for you to select the size of friggin' avatars
2011-11-14T07:37:00.000Z	welder	|Slacker|	I don't have any empathy options in the top bar when Empathy is selected
2011-11-14T07:38:00.000Z	|Slacker|	welder	how come dude
2011-11-14T07:40:00.000Z	welder	|Slacker|	i dunno but see for yourself
2011-11-14T07:41:00.000Z	welder	|Slacker|	http://bayimg.com/daKDfaADP my mouse was over the top bar and no options
2011-11-14T07:41:00.000Z	welder	|Slacker|	how do you change your Empathy options?
2011-11-14T07:42:00.000Z	|Slacker|	welder	I use pidgin
2011-11-14T07:42:00.000Z	welder	|Slacker|	pidgin supports OTR right? maybe I'll just use it too
2011-11-14T07:43:00.000Z	|Slacker|	welder	yeah it supports
2011-11-14T07:44:00.000Z	|Slacker|	welder	when I selecte pidgin and put the mouse on the taskbar, I can see the menu no problems, it doesn't happen there?
2011-11-14T07:44:00.000Z	welder	|Slacker|	no, its not available for Empathy
2011-11-14T07:45:00.000Z	welder	|Slacker|	part of the new Ubuntu mindset of removing control from the user
2011-11-14T07:46:00.000Z	|Slacker|	welder	I disagree...I used empathy before and the menu was there
2011-11-14T07:46:00.000Z	welder	|Slacker|	maybe its a bug on my system
2011-11-14T07:47:00.000Z	|Slacker|	welder	maybe..
