2012-04-21T20:45:00.000Z	milen8204	auronandace	My system cant read a txt files on my language
2012-04-21T20:45:00.000Z	auronandace	milen8204	which language? what program are you opening the text file with?
2012-04-21T20:47:00.000Z	milen8204	auronandace	the language is Bulgarian (Cyrillic ) like Russian and the gedit see only symbols
2012-04-21T20:47:00.000Z	milen8204	auronandace	like this Äèøàé, äúëáîêî è áàâíî
2012-04-21T20:48:00.000Z	auronandace	milen8204	those don't appear as symbols to me (but i'm on pcbsd9 at the mo)
2012-04-21T20:49:00.000Z	milen8204	auronandace	they are symbols for me what should I do ?
2012-04-21T20:50:00.000Z	auronandace	milen8204	i'm guessing here but you could look for language packs in synaptic, any bulgarian cyrillic one you haven't installed?
2012-04-21T20:52:00.000Z	milen8204	auronandace	I will see what is going to happen in Synaptic
2012-04-21T21:01:00.000Z	milen8204	auronandace	nothing happen still see symbols
2012-04-21T21:02:00.000Z	auronandace	milen8204	did you install anything from synaptic? any more language packs?
2012-04-21T21:04:00.000Z	auronandace	milen8204	and you restarted afterwards i guess?
2012-04-21T21:04:00.000Z	milen8204	auronandace	I am trying to set subtitles  on my VLC
2012-04-21T21:04:00.000Z	milen8204	auronandace	yes i did
2012-04-21T21:05:00.000Z	auronandace	milen8204	hmm, most perplexing.. not sure what to suggest next sorry
