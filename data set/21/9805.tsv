2005-07-07T09:29:00.000Z	kvidell	Brenton	mount it -ro (read only)
2005-07-07T09:30:00.000Z	Brenton	kvidell	 do I have to unmount it first?
2005-07-07T09:30:00.000Z	kvidell	Brenton	uh huh.
2005-07-07T09:31:00.000Z	Brenton	kvidell	how do I do that :)
2005-07-07T09:31:00.000Z	kvidell	Brenton	sudo umount /mount/point works
2005-07-07T09:32:00.000Z	Brenton	kvidell	cool, so now I want to do "sudo mount -t -ro ntfs /dev/hda5 /mnt/ddrive?"
2005-07-07T09:34:00.000Z	Brenton	kvidell	sudo mount -t ntfs -ro /dev/hda5 /mnt/ddrive  ...cause it didn't work
2005-07-07T09:35:00.000Z	kvidell	Brenton	so apparently, try what I said but remove the "o" from -ro.
2005-07-07T09:36:00.000Z	Brenton	kvidell	worked, but still getting permissions errors
2005-07-07T09:37:00.000Z	kvidell	Brenton	Are you trying to browse as root?
2005-07-07T09:38:00.000Z	Brenton	kvidell	I'm on a live CD trying to extract crap from my failed HD
2005-07-07T09:40:00.000Z	Brenton	kvidell	yes
2005-07-07T09:41:00.000Z	kvidell	Brenton	Well, as long as it's mounted read only I don't see any harm in sudo nautilus
2005-07-07T09:42:00.000Z	Brenton	kvidell	YES! You rock!
2005-07-07T10:17:00.000Z	kvidell	Brenton	Hehe. Happy it worked for you :)
2005-07-07T10:31:00.000Z	Brenton	kvidell	one more question, how do I "scandisk" my bad drive?
2005-07-07T10:31:00.000Z	kvidell	Brenton	fsck and badblocks
2005-07-07T10:33:00.000Z	Brenton	kvidell	I tried "sudo fsck /dev/hda" but it's saying something about it not being ext2
2005-07-07T10:34:00.000Z	kvidell	Brenton	try fsck -t ntfs /dev/hda1
2005-07-07T10:39:00.000Z	Brenton	kvidell	how does badblocks work? when you run it and the numbers pop up, are those blocks that are bad?
2005-07-07T10:45:00.000Z	kvidell	Brenton	I'm not really sure.. the man page is kind of uninformative too
