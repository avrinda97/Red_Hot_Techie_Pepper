2009-11-16T06:58:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	johnny05	What peice of hardware is it?
2009-11-16T06:59:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	johnny05	Try to connect to the network is a good way to test it. Or "sudo lshw -c lan"
2009-11-16T06:59:00.000Z	johnny05	linuxguy2009	i can connect to the internet through the eth0 connection, i want the ath0 to work.

2009-11-16T07:03:00.000Z	johnny05	linuxguy2009	any ideas? i'm doing this from command line only.
2009-11-16T07:03:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	johnny05	Looks like the wireless card is detected just fine.
2009-11-16T07:04:00.000Z	johnny05	linuxguy2009	it does. so how can i tell if it's the madwifi driver or something else?
2009-11-16T07:04:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	johnny05	Do you have the wireless antenna turned on, on your router?
2009-11-16T07:04:00.000Z	johnny05	linuxguy2009	routers fine, i'm connected to it on this computer.
2009-11-16T07:05:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	johnny05	Did the device work out of the box? Also did you install other drivers?
2009-11-16T07:05:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	johnny05	Your trying to see which on actually worked?
2009-11-16T07:06:00.000Z	johnny05	linuxguy2009	the adapter works when running a desktop install of ubuntu. right now i'm trying a minimal install. compiled the madwifi driver, but not sure if i installed it correctly.
2009-11-16T07:07:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	johnny05	Well if the device wasnt detected before and now it is detected after a driver install I would have to say yeah. I miss something?
2009-11-16T07:07:00.000Z	johnny05	linuxguy2009	so is there any way to check if a particular driver has been loaded
2009-11-16T07:08:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	johnny05	No idea.
2009-11-16T07:09:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	johnny05	Was there a driver to begin with? And you wanted to replace it?
2009-11-16T07:09:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	johnny05	Your not telling me something here.
2009-11-16T07:11:00.000Z	johnny05	linuxguy2009	if a minimal ubuntu install of 9.04 has a wireless driver, than it did. i tried installing madwifi. i would like to know if i did it successfully?
2009-11-16T07:12:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	johnny05	Not sure. I personally would have done a "sudo lshw -c lan" before and after the install and it would tell you right away.
