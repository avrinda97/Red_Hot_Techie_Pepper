2009-01-20T23:41:00.000Z	plytheman		oops, one sec
2009-01-20T23:42:00.000Z	plytheman		 ls -l /usr/local/games
2009-01-20T23:42:00.000Z	plytheman		total 0
2009-01-20T23:42:00.000Z	plytheman		-rw-r--r-- 1 plytheman root 0 2009-01-20 13:40 nwn
2009-01-20T23:43:00.000Z	ASULutzy	plytheman	that needs to be a folder, and it's not
2009-01-20T23:43:00.000Z	ASULutzy	plytheman	folders are marked with d and are executable. You have a file called nwn?
2009-01-20T23:43:00.000Z	ASULutzy	plytheman	You sure you don't want that to be a folder?
2009-01-20T23:44:00.000Z	plytheman	ASULutzy	i don't know why its not a folder or where the 'nwn' came from, I'm assuming thats as far as the .sh got in the installation
2009-01-20T23:45:00.000Z	ASULutzy	plytheman	You could always paste the .sh file to a pastebin and we could look through it for some sanity checking
2009-01-20T23:46:00.000Z	plytheman	ASULutzy	 I got it from a huge thread in Ubuntu forums, didn't see anyone with my problem tho
2009-01-20T23:46:00.000Z	plytheman	ASULutzy	so I think its something on my end
2009-01-20T23:46:00.000Z	ASULutzy	plytheman	What is the specific error that you get when you run the script?
2009-01-20T23:53:00.000Z	plytheman	ASULutzy	/games/nwn is owned by me and all permissions but the installer still isn't working
2009-01-20T23:53:00.000Z	ASULutzy	plytheman	What is the error now?
2009-01-20T23:53:00.000Z	plytheman	ASULutzy	same thing,
2009-01-20T23:54:00.000Z	ASULutzy	plytheman	Paste the error message into a pastebin along with the output of ls -l in the folder you are trying to install to
2009-01-20T23:54:00.000Z	ASULutzy	plytheman	paste the error to a pastebin and also paste the output of ls -l in /usr/local/games/
2009-01-20T23:57:00.000Z	ASULutzy	plytheman	Weird,
2009-01-21T00:04:00.000Z	ASULutzy	plytheman	The script must not be coded correctly, the directory is definitely writable, could always paste the script to a pastebin and we could take a look
2009-01-21T00:04:00.000Z	plytheman	ASULutzy	I'll google the error message first, if I don't find anything I'll pastebin it
