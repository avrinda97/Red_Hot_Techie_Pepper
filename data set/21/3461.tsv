2008-12-27T09:44:00.000Z	adam7	deadamerican	what flash applet is choppy?
2008-12-27T09:45:00.000Z	deadamerican	adam7	not an applet, all flash based video and websites, like watching in slow motion
2008-12-27T09:45:00.000Z	adam7	deadamerican	what graphics card?
2008-12-27T09:47:00.000Z	deadamerican	adam7	what video card you have?
2008-12-27T09:51:00.000Z	adam7	deadamerican	it's official title is : ATI Catalystâ„¢ 8.12 Proprietary Linux x86 Display Driver
2008-12-27T09:52:00.000Z	deadamerican	adam7	dont care what they call it, they are using "friendly" terms since people are still trying to make linux more accessible
2008-12-27T09:54:00.000Z	deadamerican	adam7	does it with both 32 and 64 for me
2008-12-27T09:55:00.000Z	deadamerican	adam7	but i guess its a nvidia issue, passing most options in xconfig seem to have no effect, except nologo
2008-12-27T09:58:00.000Z	deadamerican	adam7	see what i wrote?
2008-12-27T09:58:00.000Z	adam7	deadamerican	yeah, and I don't have any suggestions
