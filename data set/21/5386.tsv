2007-10-24T11:35:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov		Hello everyone
2007-10-24T11:35:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov		What is the most commonly used mail server for Linux-based servers?
2007-10-24T11:36:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov		I'm trying to host email on my own domain
2007-10-24T11:36:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov		Sendmail never worked for me
2007-10-24T11:36:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov		Once again: Sendmail itself doesn't interest me, I know nothing about it and I can't set it up to use MySQL as far as I know
2007-10-24T11:36:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov		I was looking at either Postfix, or Qmail
2007-10-24T11:37:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov		Wow
2007-10-24T11:38:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov		I want to host on my own domain, but my main problem is that Gmail and other big names reject my servers' emails
2007-10-24T11:38:00.000Z	jimmydee	AirstrikeIvanov	turn on smtp authentication
2007-10-24T11:39:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov	jimmydee	I had used Postfix combined with Courier IMAP/POP together
2007-10-24T11:39:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov		This time I am going to do Qmail for sending, but now what do I use for IMAP and POP?
2007-10-24T11:39:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov		stick with Courier?
2007-10-24T11:39:00.000Z	jimmydee	AirstrikeIvanov	I use deeproot mail server, google it, its groovy
2007-10-24T11:41:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov		Jimmydee: Searching up Deeproot Mail Server leads me to a Linux distro?
2007-10-24T11:41:00.000Z	jimmydee	AirstrikeIvanov	you got it
2007-10-24T11:41:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov		But I already have Linux
2007-10-24T11:41:00.000Z	jimmydee	AirstrikeIvanov	its a debian variant
2007-10-24T11:41:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov		took me two months to set it up
2007-10-24T11:41:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov		i already have Ubuntu
2007-10-24T11:41:00.000Z	AirstrikeIvanov		got DNS, apache, and a game server working on it
2007-10-24T11:41:00.000Z	jimmydee	AirstrikeIvanov	you really wanted to buy a new shiny mailserver anyway didnt you?
