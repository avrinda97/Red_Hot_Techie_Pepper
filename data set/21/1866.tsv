2011-02-04T22:55:00.000Z	BlaDe^	undecim	 yes
2011-02-04T22:56:00.000Z	undecim	BlaDe^	Is it currently connected to AC power?
2011-02-04T22:56:00.000Z	BlaDe^	undecim	 yes
2011-02-04T22:56:00.000Z	undecim	BlaDe^	Was it connected on boot?
2011-02-04T22:56:00.000Z	BlaDe^	undecim	yes, it's almost always connected.... i've had this problem for months.. but finally decided to try and do something about it
2011-02-04T22:56:00.000Z	BlaDe^	undecim	 I also had the issue on 10.04
2011-02-04T22:56:00.000Z	undecim	BlaDe^	My guess would be that it's a BIOS setting
2011-02-04T22:57:00.000Z	undecim	BlaDe^	But that could be wrong
2011-02-04T22:57:00.000Z	BlaDe^	undecim	 what should I look for? the bios is pretty basic for this laptop
2011-02-04T22:58:00.000Z	undecim	BlaDe^	Anything to do with clock speed or performance. Though unless you changed it yourself, I don't see any reason for it to be limiting your CPU speed
2011-02-04T22:58:00.000Z	BlaDe^	undecim	Nah I haven't touched it.
2011-02-04T22:59:00.000Z	BlaDe^	undecim	thanks for your help
2011-02-04T22:59:00.000Z	undecim	BlaDe^	Is your laptop running hot or anything?
2011-02-04T22:59:00.000Z	BlaDe^	undecim	 nope, 48degrees for the CPU
2011-02-04T22:59:00.000Z	undecim	BlaDe^	In my experience, AMD boards like to have hardware control of CPU frequency...
2011-02-04T22:59:00.000Z	BlaDe^	undecim	 I see
2011-02-04T23:00:00.000Z	undecim	BlaDe^	e.g., my laptop will only go to 1/2 speed if not plugged in
2011-02-04T23:00:00.000Z	BlaDe^	undecim	 I rarely utilise all the CPU anyway so it's not a major issue, just irritating
2011-02-04T23:00:00.000Z	undecim	BlaDe^	It might be the powernow driver, too
2011-02-04T23:00:00.000Z	BlaDe^	undecim	 that'td make proc/cpuinfo report the wrong data?
2011-02-04T23:01:00.000Z	undecim	BlaDe^	No
