2012-08-27T03:24:00.000Z	hector		how do I check if my graphics card is running a Nouveau driver or a proprietary one?
2012-08-27T03:25:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	hector	lspci -vvv usually shows driver loaded also
2012-08-27T03:27:00.000Z	hector	SolarisBoy	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation Device 1213 (rev a1) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
2012-08-27T03:27:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	hector	look at the text under it, there should be a line like 'Driver:'
2012-08-27T03:28:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	hector	for example mine says 'Kernel driver in use: i915' below the VGA section as im using an intel card
2012-08-27T03:28:00.000Z	hector	SolarisBoy	nope.. the text under it has something else, do you mind if i put it on pastebin?
2012-08-27T03:28:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	hector	sure go ahead
2012-08-27T03:30:00.000Z	hector	SolarisBoy	http://pastebin.com/GuJzS811
2012-08-27T03:31:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	hector	you have an intel onboard chip
2012-08-27T03:31:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	hector	you will the line here 'Kernel driver in use: i915' thats the driver your using i915
2012-08-27T03:31:00.000Z	hector	SolarisBoy	i guess i have an onboard from ivy bridge plus a gtx 670m
2012-08-27T03:31:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	hector	yes you do
2012-08-27T03:32:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	hector	oh i see now you have two
2012-08-27T03:32:00.000Z	hector	SolarisBoy	sorry for being a faggot but do you have any clue of how to make my gtx 670m work? i`ve been trying all the day and the last time i tried to install a driver manually i messed up with the resolution and i had to reinstall my system. jockey dont show any proprietary driver to download.
2012-08-27T03:37:00.000Z	hector	SolarisBoy	and Dr_Willis, if it really uses optimus there`s a workround for it i guess (google says so) http://bumblebee-project.org/
2012-08-27T03:40:00.000Z	hector	SolarisBoy	i tried to do that earlier with the driver 304.37 which is the latest for gtx 670m
2012-08-27T03:43:00.000Z	hector	SolarisBoy	how can i be sure that this card uses nvidia optimus technology?
2012-08-27T03:43:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	hector	no clue - i didn't know what optimus technology was until Dr_Willis stated it
2012-08-27T03:47:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	hector	silly question - does the noveau driver work?
2012-08-27T03:47:00.000Z	hector	SolarisBoy	i dont`t know m8.. i don`t even know how to check it tbh
2012-08-27T08:23:00.000Z	hector	SolarisBoy	it`s working now
