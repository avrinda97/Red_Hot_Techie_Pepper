2008-09-29T14:24:00.000Z	ikonia	mija	so today ?
2008-09-29T14:21:00.000Z	ikonia	mija	there was an update a day or so ago for some of the core libraries for thunderbird/firefox, it may sound obvious but if you have done this updated with thunderbird or firefox running,you need to restart them
2008-09-29T14:22:00.000Z	mija	ikonia	i had restartet 3 times
2008-09-29T14:22:00.000Z	ikonia	mija	no problem, I had to make sure you'd tried it
2008-09-29T14:22:00.000Z	ikonia	mija	what is the problem ?
2008-09-29T14:23:00.000Z	ikonia	mija	when did you update ?
2008-09-29T14:24:00.000Z	ikonia	mija	Hmmm not sure what's out today and whats required, again, this may sound obvious, but rebooting the box to make sure your updates are applied is a good step forward before panicing
2008-09-29T14:25:00.000Z	mija	ikonia	ok i will reboot my machine again... be back in 5 minutes
2008-09-29T14:25:00.000Z	ikonia	mija	I know its "obvious" but it doesn't hurt to make sure updates are applied
2008-09-29T14:29:00.000Z	mija	ikonia	it looks like that i am be stupid.... but the reboot of the complete machine solve's the problem.... i don't know why. The only thing why a reboot is needed are on kernel upgrades. But for only one package?....
2008-09-29T14:30:00.000Z	ikonia	mija	nah, if libraries update that the desktop needs you need to restart X (which a reboot does)
2008-09-29T14:31:00.000Z	mija	ikonia	i believe you.. but i have made a ctrl + alt + backspace
2008-09-29T14:31:00.000Z	ikonia	mija	depends what was updated
2008-09-29T14:31:00.000Z	mija	ikonia	easy... important is that it works
2008-09-29T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	mija	I'll look at what the recent updates are today
