2007-01-24T09:26:00.000Z	ehird		Yes, Ubuntu 6.10 DOES install perfectly on the new intel macs!!!
2007-01-24T09:26:00.000Z	ehird		\o/
2007-01-24T09:26:00.000Z	bitmvnch	ehird	not quite perfectly, but it works.
2007-01-24T09:26:00.000Z	ehird	bitmvnch	it's working perfectly here
2007-01-24T09:27:00.000Z	bitmvnch	ehird	be sure to note that if you don't set up Boot Camp's BIOS emulation, you don't get accelerated video.
2007-01-24T09:27:00.000Z	ehird	bitmvnch	yep, i did
2007-01-24T09:27:00.000Z	bitmvnch	ehird	well, ubuntu doesn't work perfectly until it doesn't need BIOS emulation. ;)
2007-01-24T09:28:00.000Z	bitmvnch	ehird	did you not have to install lilo yourself via apt or something? i recall also having to do that step by hand.
2007-01-24T09:28:00.000Z	ehird	bitmvnch	yeah, i had to backup+restore the mbr three times :P. then install lilo, but liloconf barfed so i had to manually write one
2007-01-24T09:29:00.000Z	bitmvnch	ehird	sounds familiar..
2007-01-24T09:32:00.000Z	bitmvnch	ehird	hum, i had no trouble with airport iirc, only the ati drivers
2007-01-24T09:32:00.000Z	ehird	bitmvnch	it doesnt even show upa s a device here
2007-01-24T09:35:00.000Z	ehird	bitmvnch	no
2007-01-24T09:35:00.000Z	ehird	bitmvnch	the low end odel does
2007-01-24T09:35:00.000Z	bitmvnch	ehird	yours have ATI or NV then?
2007-01-24T09:36:00.000Z	bitmvnch	ehird	boot camp will always do that, you can't fix it.
2007-01-24T09:37:00.000Z	bitmvnch	ehird	i think future iterations of BC will improve
2007-01-24T09:46:00.000Z	bitmvnch	ehird	no idea here.
2007-01-24T09:47:00.000Z	bitmvnch	ehird	probably not?
