2006-12-23T14:25:00.000Z	cius		question about xorg, I have multiple device, monitor, and screen sections setup for my two monitors, my computer monitor and my television.  the television is screen 1, and computer monitor is screen 0.  if I setup a server layout for just the television, should "startx -- -layout TVOnly" not start xorg only upon the television?  TVOnly would be the identifier of the server layout for just the tv.
2006-12-23T14:25:00.000Z	timtrimble	cius	 most likely, yes
2006-12-23T14:26:00.000Z	cius	timtrimble	were there any specific things you had to do?  unusual settings maybe?
2006-12-23T14:26:00.000Z	timtrimble	cius	 what kind of gfx card?  ati or nvidia?
2006-12-23T14:27:00.000Z	cius	timtrimble	I have two more layouts, one for monitor only and one for tv and monitor and both work.  I have an nvidia card.
2006-12-23T14:27:00.000Z	cius	timtrimble	the TVOnly layout is the only one giving me trouble...  :-)
2006-12-23T14:27:00.000Z	timtrimble	cius	 i know exactly what you mean.
2006-12-23T14:28:00.000Z	timtrimble	cius	 i looked in the nvidia docs and eventually figured it out, let me see here, though.
2006-12-23T14:28:00.000Z	cius	timtrimble	would you mind possible pastebinning your xorg.conf for me?  I can compare it to mine and see if I see any major differences
2006-12-23T14:30:00.000Z	timtrimble	cius	- i assume you're using s-video, for "TVOutFormat", do you have "SVIDEO" or "S-VIDEO"?
2006-12-23T14:30:00.000Z	cius	timtrimble	I have S-Video
2006-12-23T14:30:00.000Z	timtrimble	cius	 change it to "SVIDEO" without a dash
2006-12-23T14:31:00.000Z	cius	timtrimble	I'll try that, but I think I've tried it before. I'll brb, gonna see if it works.
2006-12-23T14:32:00.000Z	timtrimble	cius	 k, i think it was something wierd like that
2006-12-23T14:37:00.000Z	cius	timtrimble	there was no change, I got the same error
2006-12-23T14:38:00.000Z	timtrimble	cius	 i forget what eventually got it to work.  i'll email my xorg.conf if you like
2006-12-23T14:39:00.000Z	cius	timtrimble	could you pastebin it?
2006-12-23T14:39:00.000Z	timtrimble	cius	 yeah gimme a sec
2006-12-23T14:39:00.000Z	cius	timtrimble	I appreciate it, very much.  :-)
2006-12-23T14:43:00.000Z	timtrimble	cius	 http://pastebin.com/843907
2006-12-23T15:45:00.000Z	cius	timtrimble	after comparing my xorg.conf to yours, I have been unable to solve the problem.  Would you be able to link me to the NVIDIA documentation you used?  Maybe I can figure it out from those.
