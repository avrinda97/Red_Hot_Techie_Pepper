2007-05-30T16:49:00.000Z	abo		automount of usb digital camera isn't working, anyone can help? (it used to work perfectly before)
2007-05-30T16:50:00.000Z	sacater	abo	hi, could you be a little more specific, can you say what process is failing?
2007-05-30T16:52:00.000Z	abo	sacater	no process is failing (or at least I can't see any failing) but I plug the camera and It does not mount, and I don't know how to see the device, I do lsusb and can see that it's detected properly
2007-05-30T16:52:00.000Z	abo	sacater	mounting is the problem as I don't know which /dev/<dev>...
2007-05-30T16:52:00.000Z	sacater	abo	is it one of those funny ones, where you plug it in when the camera is turned off, then turn it on after its been plugged in, to 'wake it up' as it were
2007-05-30T16:55:00.000Z	abo	sacater	I didn't did it both ways, plug and turn on and turn on and plug... I can see in the system process monitors that there is an impulse... so it should work
2007-05-30T16:56:00.000Z	sacater	abo	do you have everything installed that you need, libraries for example
2007-05-30T16:56:00.000Z	abo	sacater	it used to work untill 2 weeks ago (when I tried it the last time) today I tried it and it didn't work
2007-05-30T16:57:00.000Z	sacater	abo	hmm, have you had any software updates since then?
2007-05-30T16:57:00.000Z	abo	sacater	yes many, yesterday there was a kernel upgrad
2007-05-30T16:58:00.000Z	sacater	abo	oooooh, so there was, that may be it, kernel controls hardware
2007-05-30T05:00:00.000Z	abo	sacater	is there a way I can tell which /dev/<device> is connected to the camera.. I know that I can do lsusb, and I get : Bus 005 Device 008: ID 054c:0010 Sony Corp. DSC-S30/S70/S75/F505V/F505/FD92 Cybershot/Mavica Digital Camera... is there a way to go from one to the other?
2007-05-30T05:00:00.000Z	sacater	abo	can you try booting into the previous kernel for me
2007-05-30T05:00:00.000Z	sacater	abo	maybe
2007-05-30T05:01:00.000Z	sacater	abo	try the older kernel please, see if that one still works, that way we may know if its to do with the kernel
2007-05-30T05:01:00.000Z	abo	sacater	ok I will
2007-05-30T05:01:00.000Z	sacater	abo	go into -15
2007-05-30T05:01:00.000Z	sacater	abo	not the new -16
2007-05-30T05:08:00.000Z	abo	sacater	you are right... it worked fine now
2007-05-30T05:08:00.000Z	sacater	abo	right
2007-05-30T05:08:00.000Z	sacater	abo	please type /j #ubuntu-devel
