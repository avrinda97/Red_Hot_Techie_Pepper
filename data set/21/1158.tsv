2011-01-19T06:27:00.000Z	Poshe		How do you open sdcc? I installed it following the instructions but I can't seem to open it?
2011-01-19T06:29:00.000Z	schnuffle	Poshe	http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/doc/sdccman.html/node37.html
2011-01-19T06:30:00.000Z	Poshe	schnuffle	I can't OPEN the app.
2011-01-19T06:32:00.000Z	schnuffle	Poshe	what happens when to execute sdcc in a terminal?
2011-01-19T06:33:00.000Z	Poshe	schnuffle	how do I execute sdcc in terminal?
2011-01-19T06:36:00.000Z	Poshe	schnuffle	I know how to open terminal... but how do you open this sdcc?
2011-01-19T06:42:00.000Z	Poshe	schnuffle	I'm not sure what you mean by binary?
2011-01-19T06:38:00.000Z	schnuffle	Poshe	sdcc is a comand line too so you just enter sdcc and it should run. the tool has no GUI
2011-01-19T06:38:00.000Z	Poshe	schnuffle	sadly, it doesn't run...
2011-01-19T06:38:00.000Z	Poshe	schnuffle	I'm trying to sudo apt-get it right now.
2011-01-19T06:39:00.000Z	Poshe	schnuffle	command not found
2011-01-19T06:39:00.000Z	schnuffle	Poshe	and how did you install it
2011-01-19T06:39:00.000Z	Poshe	schnuffle	followed the instructions of copying the files into my /usr/local
2011-01-19T06:39:00.000Z	Poshe	schnuffle	or something like that.
2011-01-19T06:40:00.000Z	schnuffle	Poshe	so where is the binary  located /usr/local/bin?
2011-01-19T06:43:00.000Z	schnuffle	Poshe	an executable file called sdcc
2011-01-19T06:46:00.000Z	Poshe	schnuffle	I can't seem to be able to find the file actually, in local/bin. there's only a local/share
2011-01-19T06:50:00.000Z	schnuffle	Poshe	please elaborate on your install steps.
2011-01-19T06:51:00.000Z	Poshe	schnuffle	I don't think it's an actual program... thanks though...
