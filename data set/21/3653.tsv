2009-04-28T14:27:00.000Z	belim	arvind_khadri	oh... Even for something like evolution which is already broken? lol
2009-04-28T14:28:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	belim	yes, dont do that....
2009-04-28T14:28:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	belim	what exactly do you mean by broken over here?
2009-04-28T14:29:00.000Z	belim	arvind_khadri	well the evolution-exchange plugin constantly says "Lost Connection to Exchange Backend" which seems to be a very old bug which was resolved as I was using it fine in 8.10 but is now a problem again. And the MAPI support seems massively unstable, I can list the issues if you like?... :)
2009-04-28T14:30:00.000Z	belim	arvind_khadri	It is really annoying as I NEED exchange support lol

2009-04-28T14:33:00.000Z	belim	arvind_khadri	LOL! oh right. Well googling didnt come up with anything except really old issues. I will take a look though. Launchpad?
2009-04-28T14:33:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	belim	ya launchpad :) , how did they fix it in 8.10 , was it a patch ?
2009-04-28T14:35:00.000Z	belim	arvind_khadri	I dont know. The problem seemed to be back around version 7.10 and seemed to just be working when I installed 8.10 (only been a ubuntu user for a while. Came over from Gentoo! ;)
2009-04-28T14:35:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	belim	.oh, did you run updates today, to see if the bug has already been squished
2009-04-28T14:36:00.000Z	belim	arvind_khadri	I have run updates today yes. No joy.... :(
2009-04-28T14:37:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	belim	i would advice you to report a bug in LP,  and wait for some few days, maybe the devs are already on it :)
2009-04-28T14:37:00.000Z	belim	arvind_khadri	nice one. I will do :)
2009-04-28T14:38:00.000Z	belim	arvind_khadri	I am reading through one now anyway
