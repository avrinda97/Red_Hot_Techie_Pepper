2008-10-26T23:26:00.000Z	ransom		I've got a Core Duo iMac and I've installed hardy.  I got the wireless to work using b43 drivers and b43-firmware.  however, after i updated it stopped working.  according to the hardware drivers program, it is enabled but "not in use." any suggestions?
2008-10-26T23:27:00.000Z	ikonia	ransom	enable them
2008-10-26T23:27:00.000Z	ransom	ikonia	they are enabled.  i even re-enabled them.  they are still listed as "not in use"
2008-10-26T23:27:00.000Z	ikonia	ransom	check if they are leaded with lsmod
2008-10-26T23:28:00.000Z	ransom	ikonia	how do i do that?
2008-10-26T23:28:00.000Z	ikonia	ransom	type lsod
2008-10-26T23:28:00.000Z	ikonia	ransom	lsmod
2008-10-26T23:29:00.000Z	ransom	ikonia	what does that do?
2008-10-26T23:29:00.000Z	ikonia	ransom	show the kernel modules (drivers) loaded
2008-10-26T23:30:00.000Z	ransom	ikonia	if it is not loaded, how do i load it?
2008-10-26T23:30:00.000Z	ikonia	ransom	check if it's loaded first
2008-10-26T23:30:00.000Z	ransom	ikonia	okay, i'm going to have to switch from os x to ubuntu, be back in a sec
2008-10-26T23:34:00.000Z	ransom	ikonia	i don
2008-10-26T23:35:00.000Z	ransom	ikonia	i don't see the driver, but i do see ndiswrapper.  is that interfering with it?
2008-10-26T23:40:00.000Z	ransom	ikonia	the broadcom drivers did not show up in lsmod
2008-10-26T23:40:00.000Z	ikonia	ransom	ok, so they are genuinly not in use then, do the drivers require ndiswrapper ?
2008-10-26T23:41:00.000Z	ransom	ikonia	no, they are linux drivers made by the manufacturer.  i had to install a firmware driver called b43-firmware that is closed source, but the drivers themselves are free software off the ubuntu cd
2008-10-26T23:41:00.000Z	ikonia	ransom	did your update update the kernel
2008-10-26T23:42:00.000Z	ransom	ikonia	yes
2008-10-26T23:42:00.000Z	ikonia	ransom	kernel updates can break drivers (3rd party)
2008-10-26T23:42:00.000Z	ikonia	ransom	I would re-do the install process now the new kernel is running
