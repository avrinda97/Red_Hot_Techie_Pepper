2010-10-06T19:23:00.000Z	Ken8521	moonunit	you couldn't have been there more than 10sec
2010-10-06T19:27:00.000Z	Ken8521	moonunit	why not insall ubuntu and put openbox on it, if thats what you want?
2010-10-06T19:28:00.000Z	Ken8521	moonunit	what are the specs of the machine you're using?
2010-10-06T19:29:00.000Z	Ken8521	moonunit	why are you running crunchbang on a system that fast?
2010-10-06T19:29:00.000Z	Ken8521	moonunit	it's not really new.. it's based on ubuntu 9.10
2010-10-06T19:30:00.000Z	Ken8521	moonunit	well what were you using before  you tried crunchbang?
2010-10-06T19:30:00.000Z	Ken8521	moonunit	i said based on, not supported by..
2010-10-06T19:30:00.000Z	Ken8521	moonunit	what were you using prior to trying crunchbang?
2010-10-06T19:31:00.000Z	Ken8521	moonunit	ok, so either you didn't like ubuntu(which led you to crunchbang) or you just constantly need change.
2010-10-06T19:32:00.000Z	Ken8521	moonunit	in vbox?
