2008-06-01T02:09:00.000Z	dyerseve		anyone know how to make mount -t cifs use netbios name resolution instead of dns?
2008-06-01T02:09:00.000Z	stu	dyerseve	you have a DNS server on this network ??
2008-06-01T02:10:00.000Z	dyerseve	stu	i dont have a dns server, but it seems to be resolving the name to some random computer somewhere on the internet rather than using netbios name resolution
2008-06-01T02:11:00.000Z	stu	dyerseve	you might need samba to use wins resolution; during the samba install it will ask you questions about using wins server etc. Whether linux can actually broadcast for a netbios resolution I dont know - I just use IP addresses
2008-06-01T02:12:00.000Z	stu	dyerseve	also, if your hostname is responding to a computer on the internet you must be adding some kind of dns suffix automatically in your networking - you could try remove that
2008-06-01T02:12:00.000Z	dyerseve	stu	doesn't that require actually having a wins server on the network? also, smbclient does broadcast for netbios resolution (once i changes smb.conf to say name resolve order = lmhosts bcast host wins); if smbclient can do it shouldn't cifs be able to as well?
2008-06-01T02:13:00.000Z	stu	dyerseve	thats what I am not sure about, I know samba can use wins... I dont know about cifs
2008-06-01T02:13:00.000Z	stu	dyerseve	any windows server on your network (master browser) could act as a wins server
2008-06-01T02:16:00.000Z	dyerseve	stu	having a wins server wasn't necessary with windows; anyway, how do i check for/remove a dns suffix? (right now the xp machine im trying to connect to is just called "quark")
2008-06-01T02:17:00.000Z	stu	dyerseve	in a workgroup environment the windows boxses elect a master browser - this server keeps track of who is who, its not a wins server like it is in a domain enivonment but there is a degree of netbios/wins resolution
2008-06-01T02:17:00.000Z	stu	dyerseve	have you given your ubuntu server a FQDN? such as box.somewhere.com or just a hostname such as box ?
2008-06-01T02:18:00.000Z	dyerseve	stu	both the ubuntu machine and the windows machine im trying to connect to just have hostnames (like box)
2008-06-01T02:19:00.000Z	stu	dyerseve	and when you ping quark from the terminal is it resolving to to quark.something ? what IP address are you getting back?
2008-06-01T02:19:00.000Z	stu	dyerseve	why not just use IP addresses by the way ?
2008-06-01T02:21:00.000Z	dyerseve	stu	ping quark tries to ping 8.15.7.117; not sure what that ip is or where its coming up with it
2008-06-01T02:22:00.000Z	dyerseve	stu	the ip changes depending on what network im on, which interface the other computer is using
2008-06-01T02:22:00.000Z	stu	dyerseve	any chance you have an actiontech router?
2008-06-01T02:24:00.000Z	stu	dyerseve	any chance you have an actiontec router?
2008-06-01T02:24:00.000Z	stu	dyerseve	reason I ask is http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r19363239-Actiontec-Router-weirdness-bugand-thoughts-GPL-code-CD
2008-06-01T02:25:00.000Z	dyerseve	stu	i have a siemmens and a zyxel router on this network
2008-06-01T02:25:00.000Z	stu	dyerseve	thats a really weird IP address to be getting a resolution of... why not sure the IP address of quark or whatever it was called?
