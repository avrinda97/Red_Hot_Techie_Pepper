2008-12-18T07:12:00.000Z	fep		i have a problem in ubuntu 8.10, when i start a mpeg/mpg movie it starts and quits as the movie starts, anyone know what codecs i need to install? apt-get what? =)
2008-12-18T07:12:00.000Z	bazhang	fep	did you install ubuntu-restricted-extras ?
2008-12-18T07:13:00.000Z	fep	bazhang	no, i will do now
2008-12-18T07:13:00.000Z	fep	bazhang	how with aptget?
2008-12-18T07:14:00.000Z	bazhang	fep	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2008-12-18T07:17:00.000Z	fep	bazhang	it was already the newest version
2008-12-18T07:18:00.000Z	bazhang	fep	do you also have w32codecs from medibuntu.org ? what format is the movie
2008-12-18T07:21:00.000Z	fep	bazhang	still just quits
2008-12-18T07:22:00.000Z	bazhang	fep	well not all mpeg work is this via totem or other
2008-12-18T07:23:00.000Z	fep	bazhang	via mplayer and totem, when i use GNOME Mplayer it plays the sound
2008-12-18T07:23:00.000Z	bazhang	fep	what about vlc and did you install the other codecs I told you to
2008-12-18T07:30:00.000Z	fep	bazhang	no, i installed all vlc things, it also quits when i start a movie
2008-12-18T07:31:00.000Z	bazhang	fep	just this particular file or all video in your possession
2008-12-18T07:32:00.000Z	bazhang	fep	you have compiz running? how much ram and what other apps you have open
2008-12-18T07:32:00.000Z	fep	bazhang	i dont think i have too much open
2008-12-18T07:33:00.000Z	bazhang	fep	that is a big culprit for eating up ram, may want to get fusion icon to switch on and off when not watching movies
2008-12-18T07:33:00.000Z	fep	bazhang	fusion icon ?
2008-12-18T07:33:00.000Z	bazhang	fep	it is a applet that lets you turn compiz on and off from your panel
2008-12-18T07:34:00.000Z	fep	bazhang	i understand, but how do i get that switch in my panel?
2011-10-06T02:51:00.000Z	bazhang	fep	try the backtrack support channel. it's not supported here
2011-10-06T02:52:00.000Z	bazhang	fep	www.ubuntu.com get the iso and burn to cd or usb stick
