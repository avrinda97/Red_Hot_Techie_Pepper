2009-05-22T20:53:00.000Z	r3dux		What's your current hostname?
2009-05-22T20:53:00.000Z	r3dux		man hostame
2009-05-22T20:53:00.000Z	r3dux		No manual entry for hostame
2009-05-22T20:53:00.000Z	r3dux		OR not...
2009-05-22T20:54:00.000Z	r3dux		typo... soz =)
2009-05-22T20:54:00.000Z	r3dux		man HOSTNAME not hostame
2009-05-22T20:56:00.000Z	r3dux		Bohne, you'll be lucky to get any optical out of a HDA-Intel. Make sure you have the latest Alsa (1.0.19 as of speaking) - but even then, I doubt it
2009-05-22T20:57:00.000Z	r3dux		Bohne, have you tried "auto", "default", "6stack-dig", etc etc to try to find a version that works? You can look up the options avail for HDA-Intel, I just don't know them off the top of my head...
2009-05-22T20:58:00.000Z	r3dux		gnome-alsamixer
2009-05-22T20:58:00.000Z	b0hne	r3dux	is coax or any other connection known to work?
2009-05-22T20:58:00.000Z	r3dux		No hitting M for mute/unmute...
2009-05-22T20:59:00.000Z	r3dux		I have no idea, sorry b0hne --- my HDA-Intel ALC889 works for laptop speakers, and I use this cheap-ass external SB16 with optical/in/out to push stuff to speakers or record

2009-05-22T21:00:00.000Z	r3dux		Yum :)
2009-05-22T21:04:00.000Z	r3dux		I changed my NAS mounting from sbbfs to cifs today because, apparently, smbfs is depracated... Still works, don't know why I bothered...
2009-05-22T21:04:00.000Z	r3dux		"smbfs"
2009-05-22T21:05:00.000Z	r3dux		Raex - which soundcard?
2009-05-22T21:07:00.000Z	r3dux		Plugged in HDMI the other day to watch an avi on screen - lovely picture, zero sound. Worked first time in Vista. =/
2009-05-22T21:07:00.000Z	r3dux	Jugger	> System | Adminstration | NVIDIA X Server Settings
2009-05-22T21:07:00.000Z	b0hne	r3dux	sorry for delay. so it will be best to check out for a good working soundcard to have my optical device feeded :D btw my ati sound over hdmi didnt even work in vista ;)
