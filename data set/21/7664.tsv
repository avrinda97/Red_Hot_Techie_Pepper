2007-07-16T16:51:00.000Z	Tama00		lol so you guys all think its normal that nvidia-xconfig conflicts with nvidia-glx hhaha
2007-07-16T16:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	Tama00	Why not?
2007-07-16T16:55:00.000Z	Stormx2	Tama00	What exactly are you trying to do here?
2007-07-16T16:55:00.000Z	Tama00	Stormx2	dont worry... i just wanted the gui thing for nvidia settings and its already included
2007-07-16T05:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	Tama00	No, it isn't. I think it's called X because a previous windowing system was called W, or something
2007-07-16T05:01:00.000Z	Tama00	Stormx2	so the next windows system will be called y :D
2007-07-16T05:02:00.000Z	Stormx2	Tama00	Not really, X is pretty well established. Note that you're not actually using X, you're using X.org, which is a fork of X.
2007-07-16T05:03:00.000Z	Tama00	Stormx2	isnt it a fork of X11
2007-07-16T05:04:00.000Z	Stormx2	Tama00	Uhg, whatever... I forget
2007-07-16T05:05:00.000Z	Tama00	Stormx2	but maybe it was called W because of Xerox..
2007-07-16T05:06:00.000Z	Stormx2	Tama00	Actually, there wasn't a W. I'm thinking of B/C. Anyway, why would it be because of Xerox?
2007-07-16T05:06:00.000Z	Tama00	Stormx2	because Xerox the now photocoping company was the first place they invented the GUI
2007-07-16T05:07:00.000Z	Tama00	Stormx2	thats right it was Apple or Microsoft
2007-07-16T05:09:00.000Z	Stormx2	Tama00	The GUI is an evolutionary thing. No one "invented" it.
2007-07-16T05:10:00.000Z	Tama00	Stormx2	nar actually Xerox did :P and microsoft and apple both claimed they did and sued each other for ages over it then they finally discovered that they both copied xerox (yes they actualyl went there and saw it from xerox) and xerox said they didnt want to sue anyone over it
2007-07-16T05:12:00.000Z	Stormx2	Tama00	That is a very absolutist view. As I previously said, no one invented the GUI we know today. It was an evolution involving many companies/individuals.
2007-07-16T05:12:00.000Z	Stormx2	Tama00	It's like asking who invented the internet. The people who made TCP/IP? HTTP? Copper cable?
2007-07-16T05:13:00.000Z	Tama00	Stormx2	yeah but who came up with the idea for the internet was the inventor
2007-07-16T05:14:00.000Z	Stormx2	Tama00	Again, an over simplification. Who came up with the idea that two transistors can interact? Who came up with the idea of connecting one computer to another? The idea of the HTTP protocol etc.
2007-07-16T05:15:00.000Z	Tama00	Stormx2	yeah you can answer those questions lol
2007-07-16T05:15:00.000Z	Stormx2	Tama00	Continue in #ubuntu-offtopic.
