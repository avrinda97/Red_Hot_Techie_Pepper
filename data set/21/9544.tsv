2008-04-09T13:20:00.000Z	aftertaf		hey :) i'm considering making a bootable usb HDD with ubuntu, to be used for image duplication.
2008-04-09T13:21:00.000Z	aftertaf		what's the easiest way of instyalling ubuntu on a usb HDD?
2008-04-09T13:22:00.000Z	aftertaf		basically i want to ditch Ghost and DOS
2008-04-09T13:22:00.000Z	aftertaf		i hate having to resort to tacky dos boot disks for anything bootable...
2008-04-09T13:22:00.000Z	aftertaf		there is clonezilla that looks good
2008-04-09T13:23:00.000Z	aftertaf		but not yet used, just read up
2008-04-09T13:23:00.000Z	cwillu	aftertaf	the installing-ubuntu-on-an-eeepc has a good write up of installing a livecd onto usb
2008-04-09T13:23:00.000Z	aftertaf	cwillu	thx :)
2008-04-09T13:25:00.000Z	aftertaf	cwillu	ntfs partitions :(
2008-04-09T13:25:00.000Z	aftertaf	cwillu	for DD etc. plus the size of direct duplication is too big for distributing...
2008-04-09T13:26:00.000Z	aftertaf	cwillu	you have a url for the eeepc thing, google fills me with randomness :)
2008-04-09T13:26:00.000Z	cwillu	aftertaf	dd if=/dev/sda1 bs=65536 | gzip | netcat target.host is the command line burned into my brain :p
2008-04-09T13:30:00.000Z	aftertaf	cwillu	thx a lot man, good help :)
2008-04-09T13:31:00.000Z	cwillu	aftertaf	you're not trying hard enough
2008-04-09T13:31:00.000Z	cwillu	aftertaf	I needed xp for work, and so I converted the company to ubuntu :p
2008-04-09T13:32:00.000Z	cwillu	aftertaf	you could use wine with the libs, no?
2008-04-09T13:33:00.000Z	aftertaf	cwillu	thinking of trying it too :) just for the libs, while compiling C++ for linux?
2008-04-09T13:34:00.000Z	aftertaf	cwillu	er, yeah  sorry :)
2008-04-09T13:36:00.000Z	aftertaf	cwillu	wine? ok worth a try.... using the windiws compiled executables and the librarires...?
2008-04-09T13:37:00.000Z	cwillu	aftertaf	yep
2008-04-09T14:01:00.000Z	aftertaf	cwillu	thanks again :)
