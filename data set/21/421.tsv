2012-05-28T06:15:00.000Z	Malsasa		Hello, i wanna compile a program from source in Maverick. Anybody can give me suggestion? What application I should compile?
2012-05-28T06:15:00.000Z	Malsasa		I wanna learn compiling from source.
2012-05-28T06:16:00.000Z	Malsasa		GNU Hello is a program?
2012-05-28T06:16:00.000Z	muelli	Malsasa	? you can compile anything, really.. apt-get source $package will get you the source of any package and "dpkg-builddep" (I think) will get you the necessary dependencies.
2012-05-28T06:18:00.000Z	muelli	Malsasa	compile hello, world.
2012-05-28T06:30:00.000Z	muelli	Malsasa	just do "apt-get source" on anything, really...
2012-05-28T06:26:00.000Z	muelli	Malsasa	compile hello, world.
2012-05-28T06:27:00.000Z	Malsasa	muelli	i have done it.
2012-05-28T06:27:00.000Z	muelli	Malsasa	great. Now you've learnt to compile.
2012-05-28T06:29:00.000Z	muelli	Malsasa	then follow the instructions in the README or INSTALL file more closely.
2012-05-28T06:29:00.000Z	Malsasa	muelli	i have done it many many times
2012-05-28T06:30:00.000Z	Malsasa	muelli	Give me one example, a tarball easy to compile.
2012-05-28T06:30:00.000Z	muelli	Malsasa	then either you haven't done it correctly or the instructinos are bad.
2012-05-28T06:30:00.000Z	Malsasa	muelli	a program who dont need many dependencies...
2012-05-28T06:31:00.000Z	Malsasa	muelli	yes the answer is i haven't done it correctly
2012-05-28T06:32:00.000Z	muelli	Malsasa	you know what? You'd solve your problem much quicker if you actually told us *what* the problem is.. i.e. error messages or the like...
2012-05-28T06:32:00.000Z	Malsasa	muelli	my general problems is: no such files or directories
2012-05-28T06:37:00.000Z	muelli	Malsasa	why don't you just try for yourself and come back if you do have problems..?
2012-05-28T06:38:00.000Z	Malsasa	muelli	i have done it for many times and fault at all, this is my  problems :) So i ask now :D
2012-05-28T06:38:00.000Z	muelli	Malsasa	not a good approach.
2012-05-28T06:38:00.000Z	Malsasa	muelli	Yes, it is true.
