2008-11-10T09:32:00.000Z	whochismo		and yes, i already tried those websites... with no success...
2008-11-10T09:33:00.000Z	whochismo		there is not a way to "repair" an ubuntu instalation?
2008-11-10T09:34:00.000Z	nickrud	whochismo	lots of ways. check for loaded modules first:   lsmod | grep snd , you should see a handful of modules regarding sound
2008-11-10T09:36:00.000Z	whochismo	nickrud	i don't have any module loaded regarding sound
2008-11-10T09:37:00.000Z	nickrud	whochismo	hm, compiling kernel modules can be problematic, and hard to troubleshoot. Did the install complete successfully?
2008-11-10T09:37:00.000Z	whochismo	nickrud	i only tried to install the realktec drivers, and yes, it seemed to complete successfully, but without finding any appropiate driver for my computer
2008-11-10T09:38:00.000Z	nickrud	whochismo	I have no experience with that sound chip, so I'd be stabbing in the dark trying to troubleshoot remotely. I'd suggest posting to that thread for help.
2008-11-10T09:39:00.000Z	nickrud	whochismo	oh, you had working sound at one time, with the default install? Prior to running that script?
2008-11-10T09:40:00.000Z	whochismo	nickrud	yes, exactly
2008-11-10T09:41:00.000Z	nickrud	whochismo	sudo apt-get install --reinstall  linux-image-$(uname -r) should get you back your sound then
2008-11-10T09:41:00.000Z	nickrud	whochismo	you'll need to reboot after running that
2008-11-10T09:41:00.000Z	whochismo	nickrud	i already rebooted
2008-11-10T09:42:00.000Z	nickrud	whochismo	did you run the reinstall command above?
2008-11-10T09:44:00.000Z	nickrud	whochismo	run the reinstall command I gave you above, then reboot
2008-11-10T09:44:00.000Z	nickrud	whochismo	and you'll probably need to remove any changes to alsa-base you made
2008-11-10T09:45:00.000Z	whochismo	nickrud	i'm running the command right now, sorry, i missed that line
2008-11-10T09:45:00.000Z	nickrud	whochismo	get a better irc client, it'll highlight lines written to you ;)
2008-11-10T09:46:00.000Z	whochismo	nickrud	i use pidgin, it highlight the lines.. it's just me, that I never pay enough attention
2008-11-10T09:46:00.000Z	nickrud	whochismo	heh. That's why I also have a chime set for lines with my nick, I'm inattentive a lot also
2008-11-10T10:03:00.000Z	whochismo	nickrud	it worked, i can listen to music right now
2008-11-10T10:04:00.000Z	nickrud	whochismo	yw
