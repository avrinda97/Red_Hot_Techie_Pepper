2007-12-18T13:13:00.000Z	Kalamansi		what kind of apps to install to monitor and block website and limit bandwidth?
2007-12-18T13:14:00.000Z	dadehoog	Kalamansi	when you say bandwidth, you mean an allocated quota per time period, or shaping ?
2007-12-18T13:14:00.000Z	dadehoog	Kalamansi	for traffic shaping you want to look into iptables, but you'll probably want a graphical user interface configuration tool ... (anyone know any ..?)
2007-12-18T13:17:00.000Z	dadehoog	Kalamansi	If you're looking at traffic filtering ... squid (a caching proxy server, which can also help to save total bandwidth) is also capable of filtering traffic by URI, and iptables rules can limit particular hosts/ports too
2007-12-18T13:17:00.000Z	dadehoog	Kalamansi	before you install anything ... starting reading and googling - have a look at the Ubuntu Server stuff
2007-12-18T13:21:00.000Z	dadehoog	Kalamansi	you do need a script, but firestarter will help you to write it (behind the scenes)
2007-12-18T13:24:00.000Z	Kalamansi	dadehoog	bazhang: im not familiar with the script and i dont know how to apply it...
2007-12-18T13:24:00.000Z	dadehoog	Kalamansi	try firestarter
2007-12-18T13:25:00.000Z	dadehoog	Kalamansi	and start googling and reading the ubuntu server stuff

2007-12-18T14:00:00.000Z	Kalamansi	dadehoog	how to install ssh?so i could access my ubuntu box (office) to my home
2007-12-18T14:01:00.000Z	dadehoog	Kalamansi	I really, really think you should read the Ubuntu Server guide :)
