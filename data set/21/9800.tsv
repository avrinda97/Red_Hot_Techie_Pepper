2005-07-09T16:18:00.000Z	mig`		i'm about to install ubuntu from the dvd, however in order for it to work, i am going to have to make sure the initrd file loads usb2.0 drivers (so that the kernel can find the hdd where i'm going to install ubuntu to), is there a way to do this from the installer? or do i have to install ubuntu, then boot into the livecd and recompile the initrd file?
2005-07-09T16:18:00.000Z	mig`		please someone help me, its the only thing keeping me from using ubuntu at the moment, and i want to use ubuntu
2005-07-09T16:19:00.000Z	mig`		i dont know how to make an initrd file, or (better yet) can i specify built in usb 2.0 support into the kernel?
2005-07-09T16:19:00.000Z	mig`		(from the installer)
2005-07-09T16:21:00.000Z	mig`		i've completed 1st stage of install before, however i can't boot into the system after the reboot
2005-07-09T16:23:00.000Z	mig`		my guess is that it can't find the block device (because the usb driver hasn't been installed and thus it cant detect it)
2005-07-09T16:23:00.000Z	mig`		i install grub to the usb hdd, and in bios i make it primary disk, so i just boot into ubuntu (if its plugged in)
2005-07-09T16:24:00.000Z	mig`		heh, my wireless card was detected too :p
2005-07-09T16:24:00.000Z	mig`		ok, i'm checking out the wiki
