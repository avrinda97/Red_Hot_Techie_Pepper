2005-07-07T11:30:00.000Z	avalost		Is ubuntu worth the switch from other distros?
2005-07-07T11:32:00.000Z	avalost		mandrake
2005-07-07T11:33:00.000Z	avalost		I have to admit i'm getting sort of sick of mandriva, especially with them pushing the "club" all the while
2005-07-07T11:34:00.000Z	avalost		can ubuntu use debian packages?
2005-07-07T11:34:00.000Z	nalioth	avalost	so dump mandriva and move to ubuntu
2005-07-07T11:34:00.000Z	nalioth	avalost	its not recommend to use debian packages
2005-07-07T11:35:00.000Z	avalost	nalioth	concerned about ease of use & easy transition
2005-07-07T11:35:00.000Z	nalioth	avalost	transition?
2005-07-07T11:36:00.000Z	nalioth	avalost	ubuntu is much easier than mandrake
2005-07-07T11:36:00.000Z	nalioth	avalost	you use apt-get (or one of its frontends) to install what you want
2005-07-07T11:37:00.000Z	nalioth	avalost	whatever you like, ubuntu IS linux
2005-07-07T11:37:00.000Z	nalioth	avalost	ubuntu IS linux
2005-07-07T11:39:00.000Z	nalioth	avalost	very up to date
2005-07-25T07:01:00.000Z	nalioth	avalost	your character set is incomplete (or your client won't display those characters)
2005-07-25T07:02:00.000Z	avalost	nalioth	I see the characters, but still can't make sense of it
2005-10-23T12:48:00.000Z	avalost	nalioth	am I besmirched for no reason or should I have not had any breezy updates in the past few days?
2005-10-23T12:49:00.000Z	nalioth	avalost	breezy finalled on the 13th. you should only see security updates from now on
2005-10-23T12:50:00.000Z	avalost	nalioth	hopefully we'll see new cairo/pango/bmpx and a few other choice packages
2005-10-23T12:51:00.000Z	nalioth	avalost	looks like it's more compiling (or pray for backports, eh? j/k)
2005-10-23T12:51:00.000Z	nalioth	avalost	makes life fun when time to upgrade
2006-05-13T16:30:00.000Z	avalost	nalioth	maybe meant 'fsck'? lol
