2006-09-07T13:39:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ricostallion: it won't
2006-09-07T13:39:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ricostallion: it probably was.
2006-09-07T13:40:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ricostallion: lsmod|grep snd-via
2006-09-07T13:40:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ricostallion: you assume correctly
2006-09-07T13:40:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ricostallion: hopefylly, yes.
2006-09-07T13:41:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ricostallion: if it doesn't: sudo modprobe snd-via82xx
2006-09-07T13:41:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ricostallion: that should probably fix your sound card issue.
2006-09-07T13:41:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ricostallion: to load this module automatically when you start add the following to /etc/modules : snd-via82xx
2006-09-07T13:42:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ricostallion: sudo only asks for passwords ever so often.
2006-09-07T13:42:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ricostallion: check to see if installing that module fixed your sound card.
2006-09-07T13:42:00.000Z	RicoStallion	BlueEagle	I'm not sure what you mean by adding it to etc/modules. where is that?

2006-09-07T13:46:00.000Z	RicoStallion	BlueEagle	where should I look for alsamixer?
2006-09-07T13:47:00.000Z	RicoStallion	BlueEagle	alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device
2006-09-07T13:49:00.000Z	RicoStallion	BlueEagle	Nothing returned
