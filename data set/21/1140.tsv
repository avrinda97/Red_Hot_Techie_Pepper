2011-01-24T02:28:00.000Z	c3l		ive got a problem with flash playing stuttery sometimes, ubuntu 10.10 on a new laptop, got ubuntu-restricted-extras installed. what could it be, how to get it to flow better?
2011-01-24T02:29:00.000Z	Lucase	c3l	How did you install flash
2011-01-24T02:29:00.000Z	Lucase	c3l	are you talking about FlashPlayer Plugin ?
2011-01-24T02:54:00.000Z	c3l	Lucase	nope, so it could be a firefox problem?
2011-01-24T02:39:00.000Z	c3l	Lucase	shouldnt flasplayer be in ubuntu restricted extras
2011-01-24T02:40:00.000Z	Lucase	c3l	I don't think so.
2011-01-24T02:41:00.000Z	c3l	Lucase	well flash does play. what should i install then?
2011-01-24T02:42:00.000Z	Lucase	c3l	then what is your problem ?
2011-01-24T02:42:00.000Z	c3l	Lucase	its stuttering, even though its buffered
2011-01-24T02:42:00.000Z	Lucase	c3l	Ok then I am asking, how and where did you install the flash player
2011-01-24T02:46:00.000Z	c3l	Lucase	well, at installation I chose to install 3d party software for media compatibility, and after install I installed ubuntu restricted extras. I never specifically/manually installd a flash player
2011-01-24T02:47:00.000Z	Lucase	c3l	That may be a graphic card related problem ? I'm not too sure about it .
2011-01-24T02:48:00.000Z	c3l	Lucase	I did enable the nvidia proprietary drives
2011-01-24T02:48:00.000Z	c3l	Lucase	maybe I should try and disable that, and see what happens
2011-01-24T02:49:00.000Z	Lucase	c3l	you will lose your resolution and many configs this is not recommended.
2011-01-24T02:50:00.000Z	c3l	Lucase	but I couldnt see any drawbacks before I installed/activated the proprietary nvidia drivers, I dont understand how it can suddenly cause problems afterwards. but okay, what other possible solutions are there?
2011-01-24T02:51:00.000Z	Lucase	c3l	Reinstall manually the flash player.
2011-01-24T02:51:00.000Z	c3l	Lucase	I have no idea what flashplayer ubuntu uses per default..
2011-01-24T02:52:00.000Z	Lucase	c3l	Go see the flash player that is currently installed into you package manager.
2011-01-24T02:52:00.000Z	c3l	Lucase	nofrillz: yes, I installed (and reinstalled) the restricted extras package, still flash is stuttering. got nvidia proprietary drives enabled
2011-01-24T02:53:00.000Z	Lucase	c3l	have you tried Chromium ?
