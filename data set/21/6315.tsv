2007-04-28T12:40:00.000Z	dxdt		that is weird that the cpu scaling isn't done automatically
2007-04-28T12:40:00.000Z	dxdt		mine is for my pentium m
2007-04-28T12:40:00.000Z	micahspoop	dxdt	I am having the same problem with my computer
2007-04-28T12:41:00.000Z	dxdt	micahspoop	what problem?  I think you misunderstood, my pentium-m does speedstepping fine.
2007-04-28T12:41:00.000Z	micahspoop	dxdt	ah, mine doesn't
2007-04-28T12:41:00.000Z	dxdt		micahcowan, really?
2007-04-28T12:42:00.000Z	dxdt		micahcowan, see anything unusual if you cat /proc/cpu ?
2007-04-28T12:42:00.000Z	micahspoop	dxdt	no such file directory
2007-04-28T12:43:00.000Z	dxdt		micahcowan, I mean cat /proc/cpuinfo ?
2007-04-28T12:43:00.000Z	dxdt		no question mark
2007-04-28T12:43:00.000Z	dxdt		cat /proc/cpuinfo
2007-04-28T12:46:00.000Z	micahspoop	dxdt	I sent you a message with what I got from the cat proc/cpuinfo
2007-04-28T12:47:00.000Z	dxdt	micahspoop	weird, that looks OK and all.... hmmm
2007-04-28T12:47:00.000Z	dxdt		I'm not sure what the problem could be.  It just doesn't seem to drop down to 800mhz like it should, right?
2007-04-28T12:48:00.000Z	micahspoop		yeah
2007-04-28T12:48:00.000Z	micahspoop		it runs at 1.3 all the time
2007-04-28T12:48:00.000Z	dxdt		if you do top, there isn't a program actually demanding lots of cpu power is that?  Like something that froze without you knowing?
2007-04-28T12:49:00.000Z	micahspoop		no, I am pretty much a fresh install
2007-04-28T12:49:00.000Z	dxdt	micahspoop	well I mean check top to make sure something just didn't happen to freeze I mean
2007-04-28T12:49:00.000Z	micahspoop		oh ok
2007-04-28T12:53:00.000Z	micahspoop	dxdt	nothing is frozen
