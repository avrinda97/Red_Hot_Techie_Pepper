2007-08-18T14:43:00.000Z	Lindar		Hello hello.
2007-08-18T14:43:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	hey
2007-08-18T14:44:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	"sudo apt-get install build-essentials"
2007-08-18T14:44:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	or maybe build-essential (without s)... can't remember
2007-08-18T14:44:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	yea, the LiveCD has everything you need.
2007-08-18T14:44:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	it'll ask you to put your CD in
2007-08-18T14:45:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	no, it'll specifically ask you, THEN you put the CD in. :)
2007-08-18T14:45:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	so maybe the best idea *looks at keen101* is to put your CD in first
2007-08-18T14:46:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	no
2007-08-18T14:46:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	well, yea, kind of
2007-08-18T14:46:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	but if you do it manually, you get into "dependency hell"
2007-08-18T14:46:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	with apt-get, you avoid all that because apt-get does it for you
2007-08-18T14:47:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	so if you can't use apt-get, and you MUST MUST MUST do it manually, then consider the next 30-60 minutes used for getting all the packages you need ready. :)
2007-08-18T14:50:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	nope
2007-08-18T14:50:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	cpp and gpp _maybe_
2007-08-18T14:51:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	but only install those if ndiswrapper doesn't compile
2007-08-18T14:59:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	joys
2007-08-18T15:01:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	oh, yea, yeap
2007-08-18T15:01:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	#ndiswrapper
2007-08-18T15:01:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	they will know
2007-08-18T15:01:00.000Z	javaJake	Lindar	I could tell you, but I'm leaving, so. :(
