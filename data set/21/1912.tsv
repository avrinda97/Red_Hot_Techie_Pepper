2010-03-19T00:43:00.000Z	airtonix	s4aluck	why not just use the ppa?

2010-03-19T00:47:00.000Z	s4aluck	airtonix	http://www.techdrivein.com/2010/02/ubuntuzilla-repository-makes-firefox-36.html read the coments
2010-03-19T00:47:00.000Z	airtonix	s4aluck	yes i saw the page and i dont see any reason to use it over the ppa.
2010-03-19T00:47:00.000Z	airtonix	s4aluck	its also not for karmic.
2010-03-19T00:48:00.000Z	s4aluck	airtonix	cause when new version comes you have again to look for ppa but ubuntuzulla aotomaticaly upgrade it

2010-03-19T00:49:00.000Z	airtonix	s4aluck	looks like that one ppa holds many versions
2010-03-19T00:51:00.000Z	s4aluck	airtonix	yeah, it depends on your test which to take
2010-03-19T00:52:00.000Z	airtonix	s4aluck	to be honest that script looks complicated too
2010-03-19T00:54:00.000Z	s4aluck	airtonix	http://paste.ubuntu.com/397454/ read it
2010-03-19T00:56:00.000Z	airtonix	s4aluck	note the "daily" on that ppa. and if i have to start using more than one program to update my software ill go back to using windows.
2010-03-19T00:58:00.000Z	s4aluck	airtonix	no, you will recieve a notice and if you like to upgrade it  you have to open the terminal as usual
2010-03-19T00:59:00.000Z	airtonix	s4aluck	and to be honest why should i start having seperate update managers for just one program? counter productive.
2010-03-19T01:01:00.000Z	s4aluck	airtonix	it's up to you. if you think tha ppa install to you is better than ubuntuzulla do your way
2010-03-19T01:02:00.000Z	s4aluck	airtonix	I prefer the ubuntuzilla way that's all
2010-03-19T01:03:00.000Z	airtonix	s4aluck	thats nice but when you are offering help to novices, its generally best to provide methods that conform the standard system of installing and updating software.
2010-03-19T01:04:00.000Z	s4aluck	airtonix	I am also novice but I prefer that way too
2010-03-19T01:13:00.000Z	s4aluck	airtonix	i think that you are trying to teach the novices the laziest way or the "windows" way to deal with the software for linux, uh?
