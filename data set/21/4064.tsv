2008-07-22T18:52:00.000Z	gjut	histo	I tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg several times, as you suggested. No luck
2008-07-22T19:00:00.000Z	gjut	histo	nyyt: thanks
2008-07-22T19:02:00.000Z	gjut	histo	How much do I need to uninstall in order to use envyng? Or does synaptic take care of that?
2008-07-22T19:03:00.000Z	histo	gjut	what exactly have you tried doing?
2008-07-22T19:03:00.000Z	histo	gjut	have you tried the restricted driver?
2008-07-22T19:04:00.000Z	histo	gjut	if this is just a normal nvidia card just use the restricted driver.
2008-07-22T19:04:00.000Z	gjut	histo	Yes, the nvidia-glx-legacy
2008-07-22T19:04:00.000Z	histo	gjut	So what is the problem then?
2008-07-22T19:06:00.000Z	histo	gjut	You need to check the hardware list and see which nvidia driver you are supposed to be using. Because I doubt its nvidia-glx-legacy
2008-07-22T19:06:00.000Z	histo	gjut	and envy will not work for your situation.
2008-07-22T19:06:00.000Z	gjut	histo	ok
2008-07-22T19:07:00.000Z	histo	gjut	let me check the list hol don
2008-07-22T19:08:00.000Z	histo	gjut	I did not see what snmpee_ suggestion was I came in the middle of this. You started asking me questions.
2008-07-22T19:09:00.000Z	histo	gjut	but you do need nvidia-glx-legacy and the kernel module installed for that card to work properly.
2008-07-22T19:10:00.000Z	histo	gjut	well if you just installed your kernel probably did upgrade
2008-07-22T19:10:00.000Z	histo	gjut	when you updated
2008-07-22T19:11:00.000Z	histo	gjut	there are binary driver howtos on the wiki.ubuntu.com
2008-07-22T19:11:00.000Z	gjut	histo	you are right!
2008-07-22T19:11:00.000Z	histo	gjut	then snmpee_ suggestions will work you need to recompile the kernel module
2008-07-22T19:11:00.000Z	histo	gjut	or install it from the repos
