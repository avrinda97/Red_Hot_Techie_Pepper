2007-09-05T14:29:00.000Z	nucco		how do i check free disk space on an ubuntu system via the terminal?
2007-09-05T14:29:00.000Z	sauvin	nucco	df -h
2007-09-05T14:30:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	thanxs
2007-09-05T14:30:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	worked like a charm :))
2007-09-05T14:32:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	i can do the tar and gzip part
2007-09-05T14:33:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	i'm attempting to do the tar/gzip with --remove-files
2007-09-05T14:34:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	yes, i have an ftp server on my local network
2007-09-05T14:35:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	can i pipe the output of tar/gzip to the ftp?
2007-09-05T14:35:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	oh my god... tar/gzip just deleted 30GB of my data!!!!
2007-09-05T14:39:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	my free space hasn't increased
2007-09-05T14:41:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	tar -cfz --remove-files ./Documents
2007-09-05T14:44:00.000Z	sauvin	nucco	do an ls -a and look for the LATEST timestamped file. MAYBE tar created a file, but I doubt it :(
2007-09-05T14:45:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	ok
2007-09-05T14:48:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	no luck, even /tmp is empty
2007-09-05T14:50:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	is it possible to ftp the folder across as-is?
2007-09-05T14:51:00.000Z	sauvin	nucco	possibly - can you log onto the target machine and wget the folder?
2007-09-05T14:53:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	i have to have either ftp or http on machine A
2007-09-05T14:54:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	quite complicated: it was the samba share
2007-09-05T14:54:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	making it accessible via http shouldn't be too difficult...
2007-09-05T14:54:00.000Z	sauvin	nucco	the folks on #linux will probably have a better idea how to accomplish this kind of task.
2007-09-05T15:00:00.000Z	nucco	sauvin	i haven't got a functioning Xserver
