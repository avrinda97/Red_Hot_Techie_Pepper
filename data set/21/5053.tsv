2008-05-10T08:10:00.000Z	yit4s		what is wine?
2008-05-10T08:10:00.000Z	yit4s		can i install it on ubuntu?
2008-05-10T08:11:00.000Z	yit4s		what is the difference between wine and qemu?
2008-05-10T08:11:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	wine is a compatibility layer and doesn't need you to install windows on it.  qemu requires that you install windows on it
2008-05-10T08:12:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	you have to install windows in qemu to run windows stuff.  Wine doesn't need you to install windows in it
2008-05-25T08:38:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	it's because of dhclient automatically setting DNS servers.  To fix that, change the prepend domain-name-servers setting in /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
2008-05-25T08:42:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	add this to the bottom: prepend domain-name-servers <first-ip>,<second-ip>;
2008-05-25T08:43:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	if the first ip were 192.168.1.1 and the second were 10.0.0.1, add "prepend domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1,10.0.0.1;"
2008-05-25T08:46:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	just add the line that I told you to add at the end of the file
2008-05-25T08:46:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	it doesn't matter where it is, as long as it's on a separate line
2008-05-25T08:50:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	you can still change the DNS settings
2008-05-25T09:29:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	hit the power button?
2008-05-25T13:17:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	it depends on the software
2008-05-25T13:18:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	chmod +x file.bin, then sudo ./file.bin
2008-05-25T13:18:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	but try to find a .deb package of it first
2008-05-25T13:20:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	bin
2008-05-25T13:21:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	anywhere
2008-05-25T13:22:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	just cd to to the directory that it's in before running it
2008-05-25T13:28:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	/usr/local
2008-05-25T13:29:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	linux uses various directories for program files, but ones that aren't part of the base system or from the package manager should be in /usr/local
2008-05-25T13:42:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yit4s	check the instructions for its use
