2011-07-19T19:24:00.000Z	dsnyders	recon69_lap	what do you mean?
2011-07-19T19:24:00.000Z	recon69_lap		like getting the euro symbol if it's not on you keyboard
2011-07-19T19:25:00.000Z	dsnyders	recon69_lap	The euro symbol is not part of ascii
2011-07-19T19:25:00.000Z	recon69_lap	dsnyders	that was just an example, i need other ascii symbols
2011-07-19T19:26:00.000Z	dsnyders		!keyboard
2011-07-19T19:28:00.000Z	recon69_lap		thx dsnyders, might allow me to do what i want, shift key stopped working on keyboard and it's a giant pain
2011-07-19T19:29:00.000Z	dsnyders	recon69_lap	you could try popping the cap off the key and seeing if there's dirt lodged in there.
2011-07-19T19:29:00.000Z	recon69_lap	dsnyders	no, they all stopped working
2011-07-19T19:29:00.000Z	recon69_lap	dsnyders	has to be wiring
2011-07-19T19:30:00.000Z	dsnyders	recon69_lap	$5-$10 will get you a new keyboard.
2011-07-19T19:30:00.000Z	recon69_lap	dsnyders	not for a laptop
2011-07-19T19:31:00.000Z	recon69_lap	dsnyders	really just missing the 'at' symbol
2011-07-19T19:31:00.000Z	dsnyders	recon69_lap	$500-$1000 will get you a new laptop keyboard (along with all the fixin's like hard drive screen, etc. :-)
2011-07-19T19:34:00.000Z	dsnyders	recon69_lap	I've just been googling "linux alt codes".  There might be some help there.
2011-07-19T19:36:00.000Z	recon69_lap	dsnyders	thx, might end up buying that keyboard lol
2011-07-19T19:39:00.000Z	dsnyders	recon69_lap	Check this site: http://alt-codes.org/linux/
2011-07-19T19:48:00.000Z	recon69_lap	dsnyders	think i'm stuffed, need shift key to get those unicode chars
2011-07-19T19:49:00.000Z	dsnyders	recon69_lap	Maybe you could plug in a usb keyboard until you get things set up?
2011-07-19T19:50:00.000Z	recon69_lap	dsnyders	thx for the help, i'll eather get a keyboard or find a work around
2011-07-19T19:50:00.000Z	dsnyders	recon69_lap	You're welcome.
