2011-04-01T03:13:00.000Z	maco	bin_bash	yes, its commonly recommended
2011-04-01T03:17:00.000Z	bin_bash	maco	in grsync are there any options i should enable or disable?
2011-04-01T03:18:00.000Z	maco	bin_bash	thatd totally depend on your use case and what YOU want it to do
2011-04-01T03:18:00.000Z	bin_bash	maco	I just want to be able to restore my home folder
2011-04-01T03:19:00.000Z	maco	bin_bash	you're doing the backup right now?
2011-04-01T03:19:00.000Z	bin_bash	maco	yes
2011-04-01T03:19:00.000Z	maco	bin_bash	is there an "archive" option? rsync on the command line has that, and it just automatically includes all the options you'd want for a backup
2011-04-01T03:20:00.000Z	bin_bash	maco	no
2011-04-01T03:20:00.000Z	maco	bin_bash	doesn't mean they're all actually at their keyboards
2011-04-01T03:20:00.000Z	bin_bash	maco	that's my point

2011-04-01T03:23:00.000Z	bin_bash	maco	if I use rsync from the terminal how do i know which options to use
2011-04-01T03:31:00.000Z	maco	bin_bash	i use rsync -av src dest
2011-04-01T03:32:00.000Z	maco	bin_bash	-a = archive (backup), -v = tell me what you're doing (verbose)
2011-04-01T03:33:00.000Z	bin_bash	maco	can i do it while i'm using the computer
2011-04-01T03:44:00.000Z	maco	bin_bash	i usually do, though it is *Possible* to get some weirdness if you happen to be editing a file at the moment it is copied
