2010-01-27T03:48:00.000Z	agliodbs		can anyone help me with a "Pen drive does not contain operating system" error on a Dell Mini?
2010-01-27T03:48:00.000Z	frostburn	agliodbs	you need to make sure that the usb drive has the bootable flag set...
2010-01-27T03:49:00.000Z	agliodbs	frostburn	oh, thanks.  how do I do that?
2010-01-27T03:50:00.000Z	agliodbs		i used usbcreator to populate the drive
2010-01-27T03:52:00.000Z	frostburn	agliodbs	i haven't done it in a while, this should help http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/how-to-a-bootable-flag-on-usb-stick-664033/    how did you originally build this usb key?   I've always had success with unetbootin
2010-01-27T03:53:00.000Z	agliodbs	frostburn	how do  set the bootable flag?
2010-01-27T03:54:00.000Z	frostburn	agliodbs	i guess first thing first, how did you create the bootable usb key?
2010-01-27T03:54:00.000Z	agliodbs	frostburn	using usb-creator
2010-01-27T03:58:00.000Z	frostburn	agliodbs	ah funny, i've never been able to get that to work before...  I've always used unetbootin (in the repositories)...  anyway to verify that the boot flag is set,   do a sudo fdisk -l   and make sure there's an * next to the boot disk
2010-01-27T03:59:00.000Z	agliodbs	frostburn	ok, trying
2010-01-27T03:59:00.000Z	agliodbs	frostburn	I need to reboot from HDD first
2010-01-27T03:59:00.000Z	agliodbs	frostburn	is there any way to set the boot flag for an existing USB, or do I need to reformat it?
2010-01-27T04:00:00.000Z	frostburn	agliodbs	you can set it using fdisk again    sudo fdisk /dev/sda1234   where 1234 is the drive in question... then go to the menu, press a   to make it bootable, then w to write
2010-01-27T04:01:00.000Z	agliodbs	frostburn	fdisk thinks the drive is bootable
2010-01-27T04:03:00.000Z	agliodbs		unetbootin isn't in apt-get ....
2010-01-27T04:03:00.000Z	frostburn	agliodbs	then it should work, i'd still try unetbootin ... i've always had success with that  otherwise, not sure how else i can help... might be a hardware issue too... my dell doesn't boot from the latest iso either
2010-01-27T04:04:00.000Z	agliodbs	frostburn	oh?  which dell do you have?
2010-01-27T04:04:00.000Z	frostburn	agliodbs	it's an old optiplex (tower)
2010-01-27T04:05:00.000Z	agliodbs	frostburn	ah
2010-01-27T04:05:00.000Z	agliodbs	frostburn	you said it was an issue specifically with the latest ISO?
2010-01-27T04:06:00.000Z	frostburn	agliodbs	yeah, the iso boots fine in other pcs, but doesn't in mine.  older iso's work fine though...   I'd post on the ubuntu forums to see if there's anyone else having the same issue
