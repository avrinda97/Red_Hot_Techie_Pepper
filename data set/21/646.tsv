2012-06-09T01:32:00.000Z	Plizzo		Hi, I installed Ubuntu Server 11.10 64-bit a couple of months back, and I've been getting some help from people here to set things up
2012-06-09T01:32:00.000Z	Plizzo		Although, I seem to have downgraded my kernel to a generic 32-bit one, and now I can't manage to install the 64-bit linux-image-server one. It's installed and all, but I can't choose it as my default kernel anywhere
2012-06-09T01:34:00.000Z	genii-around	Plizzo	What is the result of: apt-cache policy linux-image-$( uname -r)

2012-06-09T01:36:00.000Z	genii-around	Plizzo	Yes, this is odd if you originally installed a 64 bit kernel.
2012-06-09T01:37:00.000Z	Plizzo	genii-around	I was so damn sure that I installed a 64-bit system, and if I am wrong and accidentally installed a 32-bit one I'd be very much annoyed with myself
2012-06-09T01:37:00.000Z	Plizzo	genii-around	Would my server recognize 8GB of ram if it was 32-bit?
2012-06-09T01:38:00.000Z	Plizzo	genii-around	MemTotal:        8177912 kB
2012-06-09T01:39:00.000Z	genii-around	Plizzo	What is the result of: sudo lshw -C system| grep width
2012-06-09T01:39:00.000Z	Plizzo	genii-around	width: 32 bits
2012-06-09T01:39:00.000Z	genii-around	Plizzo	That's what the Physical Address Extensions kernel does, lets 32 bit cpu address more than about 3.2Gb of ram
2012-06-09T01:40:00.000Z	Plizzo	genii-around	I've been seriously wondering why I have no 64-bit things running :/
2012-06-09T01:40:00.000Z	Plizzo	genii-around	Are there some issues with 32-bit systems and files over 2GB?
2012-06-09T01:40:00.000Z	Plizzo	genii-around	My rTorrent is reporting files larger than 2GB as 2GB, but everything works just fine
2012-06-09T01:41:00.000Z	Plizzo	genii-around	It's just very annoying, because I can never see the real filesize there
2012-06-09T01:41:00.000Z	Plizzo	genii-around	Sorry, not rTorrent, avalanche - the web gui
2012-06-09T01:42:00.000Z	genii-around	Plizzo	Sounds like something specific to rTorrent
2012-06-09T01:42:00.000Z	Plizzo	genii-around	In rTorrent they display fine, but in the web UI they do not
2012-06-09T01:43:00.000Z	Plizzo	genii-around	I helped a friend of mine set up an exact copy of my rTorrent setup, but he does have a 64-bit system
2012-06-09T01:43:00.000Z	genii-around	Plizzo	Haven't dealt with rTorrent before. But i would suspect something like the maximum size of the variable they are using to display the filesize is set too low somehow
2012-06-09T01:44:00.000Z	Plizzo	genii-around	It seems that my xmlrpc version is low :/
