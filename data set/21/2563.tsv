2009-09-03T03:24:00.000Z	kazorin		Hey is this a place I can ask for some help? I have a sound issue.
2009-09-03T03:24:00.000Z	person	kazorin	yes
2009-09-03T03:25:00.000Z	kazorin	person	Thanks. I only have a C-Media USB adapter for headsets, a fairly new one, and I get no sound. Even though I hear the clicking and stuff when my comp comes on.
2009-09-03T03:27:00.000Z	person	kazorin	I can't really help; have you got volume unmuted and turned up? Have you tried other output devices e.g. hDA Intel, AC/97 with different things like ALSA, Pulseaudio, etc? Apart from that, I can't really help.
2009-09-03T03:27:00.000Z	person	kazorin	Ask the channel, not me :P
2009-09-03T03:28:00.000Z	kazorin	person	I just got off Windows 7. >.> Thanks.
2009-09-03T03:28:00.000Z	person		Nautilus is telling me that the atime of all the files in a directory on my USB stick is the time of the last time I mounted it. How can I view the real atimes?
2009-09-03T03:28:00.000Z	person	kazorin	s'okay
2009-09-03T03:28:00.000Z	kazorin		Does anyone here know how to make a C-Media USB headset adapter work in Jaunty?
2009-09-03T03:29:00.000Z	person	kazorin	I'm assuming you right-clicked and said 'open volume control' ?
2009-09-03T03:29:00.000Z	person	kazorin	On the sound applet, that is?
2009-09-03T03:29:00.000Z	kazorin	person	Yeah, I opened volume control. Tried editing System>Properties>Sound too. OSS gives me a steady beep under testing but other then that, no sound.
2009-09-03T03:30:00.000Z	person	kazorin	Have you used different applications to test sound?
2009-09-03T03:30:00.000Z	kazorin	person	I have no sound to test. I did just install flash on FF, maybe I'll give a youtube video a try, one second.
2009-09-03T03:31:00.000Z	person	kazorin	Yeah, I dunno maybe it's the audio playback engine thingy
2009-09-03T03:31:00.000Z	person		Or whatever you call it, things like gstreamer, xine, etc
2009-09-03T03:31:00.000Z	kazorin	person	English...? XD And, nope, no playback on firefox either.
2009-09-03T03:32:00.000Z	person	kazorin	Are Master and PCM turned up?
2009-09-03T03:32:00.000Z	kazorin	person	Yeah I have everything up. This OS was just installed today, everything's standard. Tried one fix in the alsa-base but that didn't work so I reverted it.
2009-09-03T03:33:00.000Z	person	kazorin	Ask somebody more skilled than me :P
2009-09-03T03:33:00.000Z	kazorin	person	Thanks anyways :D
