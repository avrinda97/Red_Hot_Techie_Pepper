2008-11-01T11:04:00.000Z	ay^	kebomix	try killing nm-applet
2008-11-01T11:04:00.000Z	kebomix	ay^	how ?
2008-11-01T11:05:00.000Z	ay^	kebomix	do ps aux | awk /nm-applet/

2008-11-01T11:09:00.000Z	ay^	kebomix	the first part of that line is your login name, the second is nm-applets PID
2008-11-01T11:10:00.000Z	ay^	kebomix	to kill it we now type "kill PID"
2008-11-01T11:10:00.000Z	ay^	kebomix	but what just a second with that
2008-11-01T11:10:00.000Z	ay^	kebomix	it MIGHT disconnect you from internet
2008-11-01T11:11:00.000Z	ay^	kebomix	if, for some reson starting it again doesn√§t work, you might have to reboot to get it up again
2008-11-01T11:11:00.000Z	kebomix	ay^	i rebooted it up 1 time , still have same problem
2008-11-01T11:12:00.000Z	ay^	kebomix	okay, so then this might not work, but at least when you start it with "nm-applet" it might give you an error message
