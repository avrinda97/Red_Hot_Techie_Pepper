2010-05-03T21:06:00.000Z	uLinux		trailers
2010-05-03T21:08:00.000Z	_jesse_	uLinux	he means if you watch the video in flash in your browser, it should be in the tmp files somewhere
2010-07-27T06:19:00.000Z	_jesse_	uLinux	make sure you have localhost in /etc/hosts
2010-07-27T06:19:00.000Z	uLinux	_jesse_	ill check
2010-07-27T06:20:00.000Z	uLinux	_jesse_	127.0.0.1 localhost
2010-07-27T06:28:00.000Z	_jesse_	uLinux	looks good
2010-07-27T06:28:00.000Z	_jesse_	uLinux	the two IP thing is just because there is an IPv6 address for localhost too
2010-07-27T06:28:00.000Z	uLinux	_jesse_	I thought I disabled ipv6 :\
2010-07-27T06:29:00.000Z	_jesse_	uLinux	comment out the lines in /etc/hosts for ipv6 then
2010-07-27T06:30:00.000Z	uLinux	_jesse_	take a look http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=J7V9Ynei
2010-07-27T06:30:00.000Z	_jesse_	uLinux	yes, you have the IPv6 lines there
2010-07-27T06:31:00.000Z	uLinux	_jesse_	I know :P I added them to disable ipv6... how can that conflict with localhost? in my other pc it works fine :(
2010-07-27T06:31:00.000Z	_jesse_	uLinux	::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback still maps 'localhost' to an ipv6 address
2010-07-27T06:31:00.000Z	_jesse_	uLinux	see the line?
2010-07-27T06:32:00.000Z	_jesse_	uLinux	then localhost is still mapping to two addresses
2010-07-27T06:32:00.000Z	uLinux	_jesse_	ill uncomment that line
2010-07-27T06:32:00.000Z	_jesse_	uLinux	it isn't commented
2010-07-27T06:33:00.000Z	uLinux	_jesse_	typo :P
2010-07-27T06:36:00.000Z	uLinux	_jesse_	tks for the help now localhost scanning works
2010-07-27T06:36:00.000Z	_jesse_	uLinux	np :)
