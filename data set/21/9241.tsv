2006-01-21T10:18:00.000Z	cribbon		hey all
2006-01-21T10:18:00.000Z	cribbon		i'm having a problem, i cannot reach ubuntuforums.org , but i can on windows. Anyone got any guesses?
2006-01-21T10:19:00.000Z	_jason	cribbon	I can't reach it either, seems to be down
2006-03-03T15:11:00.000Z	_jason	cribbon	~/.gnome*, delete them
2006-03-03T15:11:00.000Z	cribbon	_jason	can you tell me something more about what things will be removed ?
2006-03-03T15:12:00.000Z	_jason	cribbon	even better would be for you to just rename them, that way you won't lose anything
2006-03-03T15:12:00.000Z	_jason	cribbon	all your settings are stored in those two directories
2006-03-03T15:12:00.000Z	cribbon	_jason	ah, excellent. ( So i rename them with .backup_gnomeXX and logs out and in, thus creating a new automazid config ? )
2006-03-03T15:13:00.000Z	_jason	cribbon	that's the plan :), .gnome and .gnome2 should do it
2006-03-03T15:13:00.000Z	cribbon	_jason	thanks =)
2006-03-03T15:24:00.000Z	cribbon	_jason	I still had the same splash and background. No panels avavible.
2006-03-03T15:25:00.000Z	cribbon	_jason	hrm, just got an idea, do you know where the falesafe config is stored ? Maybe we could make them "default" somehow ?
2006-03-03T15:25:00.000Z	_jason	cribbon	someone mentioned mv'ing ~/.gconf and ~/.gconfd
2006-03-03T15:26:00.000Z	_jason	cribbon	you could just create a new user
2006-03-03T15:26:00.000Z	cribbon	_jason	i'll try the new user way. =)
2006-03-03T15:26:00.000Z	_jason	cribbon	gconf controls the splash so you might want to try those two directories first
2006-03-03T15:27:00.000Z	cribbon	_jason	the splash isnt the problem. I have the same splash in failsafe and there it works.
2006-03-03T15:27:00.000Z	_jason	cribbon	k
2006-03-22T16:35:00.000Z	_jason	cribbon	edit the file ~/.gnome2/session-manual
2006-03-22T16:38:00.000Z	cribbon	_jason	hrm, i cannot find the values i addes in ~.gnome2/session
2006-03-22T16:39:00.000Z	cribbon	_jason	the file session-manual does not exist.
