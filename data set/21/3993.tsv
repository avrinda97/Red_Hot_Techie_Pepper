2012-05-11T02:57:00.000Z	platinum		hey everyone, where can I ask a really newbie question about ubuntu server?
2012-05-11T02:59:00.000Z	platinum		okay here goes. I set up a ubuntu server 64 bit on an IBM xServer like. 6 years ago. Now I want to upgrade, but found you can only do fresh install when it's that old. I have not touched the server since I set it up and forgot what I did. Is there any way to keep settings (hostname, apache setup, ip addresses and such)?
2012-05-11T03:00:00.000Z	ellis	platinum	do you remember what/if any settings you made when you set up the server?
2012-05-11T03:17:00.000Z	platinum	ellis	thank you and have a good evening.
2012-05-11T03:01:00.000Z	platinum	ellis	it acts as a firewall and proxy and has squid, apache2, and squidGuard. other than that, no. The thing has worked like a dream so I haven't messed with it. Also I don't have much linux experience. :)
2012-05-11T03:03:00.000Z	platinum	ellis	I know.. I have been doing the "if it aint broke" for many years, but it's running like 6.04 or something and I do worry about the lack of updates/support. I'd like to go to 12.04 LTS.
2012-05-11T03:03:00.000Z	ellis	platinum	yeah It's a good time to change since it's right after the release of an LTS version
2012-05-11T03:04:00.000Z	platinum	ellis	yep that's what I was thinking. :) but it sure would save time if I could transfer some of my settings and not try to do the whole thing from scratch again. And I'd like it to be as transparent to the users as possible.
2012-05-11T03:04:00.000Z	ellis	platinum	If you have an external HD that's big enough to clone your filesystem, it's incredibly easy to do that. So clone the files, reformat your computer then just copy settings/files from your clone as and when you find things that need configuring
2012-05-11T03:05:00.000Z	ellis	platinum	would result in system down time though, if that's critical
2012-05-11T03:08:00.000Z	ellis	platinum	as long as you can copy files back and forth from the drive, then that's all that matters. All you're really doing is copying every single file from the computer over to the drive, then you can selectively copy important ones back again once you're on 12.04
2012-05-11T03:08:00.000Z	ellis	platinum	check this out https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Full_System_Backup_with_rsync
2012-05-11T03:10:00.000Z	platinum	ellis	yes, okay that's great I just hope my config files will work with my newer versions and that I can find where they go :) Thanks for the article, I will try rsync, currently my backups are done with tar.
2012-05-11T03:10:00.000Z	platinum	ellis	will I be able to copy some file that sets a runlevel (I think that's what it called) where there is no desktop? That's how it is currently configured.
2012-05-11T03:13:00.000Z	ellis	platinum	the benefit of rsync is that it's incredibly stupid. All it does it create a mirror image of your files which you can sift through, no need to unpack/compress etc. As for the runlevel, you'll have to ask some server gurus that, I don't know so much when it comes to Server setups. If you just want a computer without a graphic environment (command line), that'd be easy enough to do
2012-05-11T03:14:00.000Z	ellis	platinum	you wouldn't even need to change anything unless you wanted to, all Linux boxes can drop to the command line by just pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1/F2/F3/etc
2012-05-11T03:15:00.000Z	platinum	ellis	yes I have been reading the article about rsync and it looks like it will work really well for what I would need. An exact copy would be absolutely wonderful.  I do prefer that the server boots to a console though. Makes it easier for me since all the server stuff I do seems to use command line anyway.
2012-05-11T03:15:00.000Z	platinum	ellis	I am sure there are howtos on line since I have figured it out once before.
2012-05-11T03:15:00.000Z	platinum	ellis	thank you very much for your help. I just need to figure out how I configured my RAID1 and partitions.
2012-05-11T03:16:00.000Z	ellis	platinum	yes I expect so. Uninstalling any graphic components should be easy enough. Don't even mention RAID to me haha, bad memories. no problem
2012-05-11T03:17:00.000Z	ellis	platinum	you too
