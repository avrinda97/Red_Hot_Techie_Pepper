2009-06-30T00:21:00.000Z	Shardded		help needed pleas
2009-06-30T00:22:00.000Z	mbeierl	Shardded	do you have the source code for the d-link card drivers?
2009-06-30T00:24:00.000Z	mbeierl	Shardded	is the file a ".tgz" or ".tar.gz" file?
2009-06-30T00:26:00.000Z	Shardded	mbeierl	it was tgz til i ran tar xzvf rhinefet.tgz
2009-06-30T00:26:00.000Z	mbeierl	Shardded	ok, so it unpacked the sources into a directory.  you need to "cd" into that directory.  tell me, is there a ".configure" file in the directory (ls -l .configure)
2009-06-30T00:29:00.000Z	Shardded	mbeierl	: no no .configure
2009-06-30T00:29:00.000Z	mbeierl	Shardded	^
2009-06-30T00:34:00.000Z	Shardded	mbeierl	: if i run make it starts off fine and then starst giving me a hole load of errors
2009-06-30T00:36:00.000Z	mbeierl	Shardded	it must be that the driver needs source code or other libraries that are not located on the same computer as the one trying to do the installation.  Do you have another computer with Ubuntu and network access?  or can you switch to a wired network temporarily?
2009-06-30T00:37:00.000Z	Shardded	mbeierl	: i have my ubuntu pc and then this vista pc  and i need to get the ethernet up and running on the ubuntu but its not working :)
2009-06-30T00:38:00.000Z	mbeierl	Shardded	it is the wireless network that is not working or the wired network?  I mistook your question for wireless as that is the most common problem
2009-06-30T00:39:00.000Z	Shardded	mbeierl	its a wired D-Link Ether net card DFE-520TX to be exsact
2009-06-30T00:42:00.000Z	Shardded	mbeierl	and i followed the install instructoins to a t its just when i get to step 5 it just tells me compile the drivers and it will generate a rhinefet.o that it loosses me
2009-06-30T00:44:00.000Z	mbeierl	Shardded	what instructions?  From where are you reading them>
2009-06-30T00:45:00.000Z	mbeierl	Shardded	from the CD?  or... a web site?
2009-06-30T00:45:00.000Z	Shardded	mbeierl	: driver cd
2009-06-30T00:46:00.000Z	mbeierl	Shardded	ok, now I understand.  as someone earlier mentioned, you might be trying to do something that is not needed.  You have installed Ubuntu on the computer, right?
2009-06-30T00:47:00.000Z	Shardded	mbeierl	: yes
2009-06-30T00:47:00.000Z	mbeierl	Shardded	you should be able to go to the main menu -> system -> preferences -> Network Connections
2009-06-30T00:47:00.000Z	mbeierl	Shardded	does it show anything under the "Wired" tab?
2009-06-30T00:48:00.000Z	Shardded	mbeierl	: brb
