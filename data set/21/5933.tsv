2007-07-06T05:15:00.000Z	ZuluKunt	ubuntu_	read some manual
2007-07-06T05:16:00.000Z	ZuluKunt	ubuntu_	no one can post a complete guide on how to install vista and ubuntu
2007-07-06T05:26:00.000Z	ZuluKunt	ubuntu_	XP doesn't know how to read/write to linux and mac partitions
2007-07-06T05:33:00.000Z	ZuluKunt	ubuntu_	then read some guides so you REALLY know what you're doing
2007-07-06T05:35:00.000Z	ZuluKunt	ubuntu_	what do you have on your hard drive right now?
2007-07-06T05:36:00.000Z	ZuluKunt	ubuntu_	ok, install ubuntu on the C drive, but make sure you select the empty drive, cuz in ubuntu there is no C, D whatever
2007-07-06T05:38:00.000Z	ZuluKunt	ubuntu_	so boot from the cd
2007-07-06T05:38:00.000Z	ZuluKunt	ubuntu_	what does that mean?

2007-07-06T05:39:00.000Z	ZuluKunt	ubuntu_	press enter
2007-07-06T05:40:00.000Z	ZuluKunt	ubuntu_	will due respect, it would take me a lifetime to tell you every keystroke you have to press to install the thang
