2011-04-08T23:27:00.000Z	[snake]		How can I use ffmpeg to convert a ton of files all at once, that are in subdirectories of directories. (convert: /path/allfiles)
2011-04-08T23:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	[snake]	 some shell scripting/ and use of find. is one way.
2011-04-08T23:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	[snake]	 find is worth learning about. :)
2011-04-08T23:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	[snake]	 or write up a script/batch file that does the work in parts. so you can monitor whats going on.
2011-04-08T23:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	[snake]	  you could put it in a text editor and edit each line, with ffmpeg -whateveroptions  yourstuff  otheroptions     then run it as a batch file..
2011-04-08T23:37:00.000Z	[snake]	Dr_Willis	and how would I tell it to keep the name?
2011-04-08T23:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	[snake]	 give it the name as an output file. Check the ffmpeg docs.
2011-04-08T23:38:00.000Z	[snake]	Dr_Willis	edit each line lol? there's 1,459 lines.
2011-04-08T23:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	[snake]	 you edit EVERY LINE and make a batch file/script out of it...
2011-04-08T23:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	[snake]	 smart text editing is a good skill to have.
2011-04-08T23:38:00.000Z	[snake]	Dr_Willis	yeah and piping output is a much easier, and effective way of doing it.
2011-04-08T23:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	[snake]	 go do it then..
2011-04-08T23:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	[snake]	 ive often made scripts that generate 'batch files' for long tasks. :)
2011-04-09T00:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	[snake]	 also watch out for spaces in filename/paths when doing this sort of task.
2011-04-09T00:15:00.000Z	[snake]	Dr_Willis	AHH TOAST!!!
2011-04-09T00:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	[snake]	 use of single quotes may be required around the path/names
2011-05-09T18:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	[snake]	 what video chipset was this?
2011-05-09T18:41:00.000Z	[snake]	Dr_Willis	it is a NVIDIA GeForce 6150SE nForce 430
2011-05-09T18:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	[snake]	 could be its using the neauvu or whatever its spelt driver.
2011-05-09T18:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	[snake]	 ive had  that driver work with some of my nvidia systems.. some not at all.. and some sort of worked. :)
2011-05-09T18:43:00.000Z	[snake]	Dr_Willis	idk... I just activated one in the restricted drivers...
