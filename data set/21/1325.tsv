2010-10-24T10:08:00.000Z	unperson	gMinuses	You could probably do a minimal install and then use dselect.
2010-10-24T10:10:00.000Z	unperson	gMinuses	Sounds like maybe tasksel is the modern equivalent.
2010-10-24T10:11:00.000Z	unperson	gMinuses	I haven't used anything like that in a long time, but I remember installing Debian and choose which software I wanted with dselect.
2010-10-24T10:12:00.000Z	gMinuses	unperson	I just installed opensuse the other day, and it supports choosing packages to install. So i'd really like ubuntu to have this feature.
2010-10-24T10:13:00.000Z	gMinuses	unperson	I'm checking Tasksel out.
2010-10-24T10:13:00.000Z	unperson	gMinuses	Remember Ubuntu is pretty closely focused around ease of use, so I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.
2010-10-24T10:14:00.000Z	unperson	gMinuses	It's just not a feature that is probably widely desired.  If that's up your alley,  would suspect Debian might suit you better.  To a large degree there's not that huge a difference between Ubuntu and Debian.
2010-10-24T10:15:00.000Z	unperson	gMinuses	Personally, I just figure the normal install is mostly stuff I want, and then I can always apt-get remove stuff I don't want.
2010-10-24T10:15:00.000Z	gMinuses	unperson	OK, may be I should install Debian. but can I add ppa source to Debian?
2010-10-24T10:16:00.000Z	unperson	gMinuses	You've got me.  I really haven't used Debian since before Ubuntu existed.
2010-10-24T10:17:00.000Z	unperson	gMinuses	You probably can't use the Ubuntu ones with Debian (or well, maybe you can but it's probably asking for conflicts).  But there may be equivalent stuff for Debian.
2010-10-24T10:17:00.000Z	gMinuses	unperson	It's OK. I will find that out myself. Thanks for your help.
2010-10-24T10:19:00.000Z	unperson	gMinuses	Right.  Certainly you could ask around in #debian
2010-10-24T10:21:00.000Z	gMinuses	unperson	two more quick question: does apt-get remove completely removes everything relates to that package? will it leave garbages? and how do I find all packages used by a certain piece of software? I tried to remove all packages contains phrase "evolution" and I was prompted that gnome-desktop would be removed too.
2010-10-24T10:24:00.000Z	unperson	gMinuses	apt-get remove will not remove some files, containing settings and things I think.  But apt-get purge will
2010-10-24T10:25:00.000Z	unperson	gMinuses	In the info for a package you can see which packages are dependent on that package.
2010-10-24T10:26:00.000Z	unperson	gMinuses	You can definitely see that in Synaptic.
2010-10-24T10:26:00.000Z	unperson	gMinuses	gnome-desktop may just be a meta-package.
2010-10-24T10:27:00.000Z	unperson	gMinuses	Meaning it may not actually install anything, it's just a placeholder that depends on a bunch of other things.  So that by installing that you'll install all those things at once.
2010-10-24T10:27:00.000Z	gMinuses	unperson	Thanks, I didn't check package dependence. Will do that in the future.
2010-10-24T10:28:00.000Z	unperson	gMinuses	It should say in the package description if it's just a meta-package.
