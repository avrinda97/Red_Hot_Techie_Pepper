2009-03-17T06:25:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	zamba	why not install an older OS version in a chroot or VM ?

2009-03-17T06:52:00.000Z	zamba	IntuitiveNipple	why can't i see them here?
2009-03-17T06:52:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	zamba	Is that dapper?
2009-03-17T06:52:00.000Z	zamba	IntuitiveNipple	this is dapper, yeah
2009-03-17T06:52:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	zamba	oh yeah I see it is :p
2009-03-17T06:53:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	zamba	Is dapper out of support? If so, the packages will have been removed from the archives
2009-03-17T06:53:00.000Z	zamba	IntuitiveNipple	according to some other person here on the channel, it was still in support
2009-03-17T06:54:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	zamba	yeah... the archive has them: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/php4/
2009-03-17T06:54:00.000Z	zamba	IntuitiveNipple	so i have to install the packages manually?
2009-03-17T06:54:00.000Z	zamba	IntuitiveNipple	instead of using apt?
2009-03-17T06:55:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	zamba	When you do apt-cache search php4 does it report no package found?
2009-03-17T06:55:00.000Z	zamba	IntuitiveNipple	i found them now :)
