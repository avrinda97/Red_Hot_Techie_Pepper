2011-11-02T14:08:00.000Z	dmb__		anyway, initially things seem bette!
2011-11-02T14:09:00.000Z	dmb__		how do I get rid of the wierd new scrollbars? (clearly I'm too old for change)
2011-11-02T14:10:00.000Z	dmb__		instead of showing a wide bar within gtk windows, it shows a thin new bar that changes when I hover over it
2011-11-02T14:10:00.000Z	dmb__		it shows a scrolly when I hover
2011-11-02T14:10:00.000Z	dmb__		I find it hard to judge the size of the area with this new (slicker looking) scrolly
2011-11-02T14:11:00.000Z	dmb__		ah
2011-11-02T14:11:00.000Z	dmb__		progress...
2011-11-02T14:11:00.000Z	dmb__		;-)
2011-11-02T14:11:00.000Z	dmb__		thanks again
2011-11-02T14:11:00.000Z	dmb__		fixing the 'composing' glytch is a massive win
2011-11-02T14:11:00.000Z	cablop	dmb__	what ubuntu? 11.10?
2011-11-02T14:12:00.000Z	dmb__	cablop	yeah
2011-11-02T14:12:00.000Z	cablop	dmb__	did you play with gnome 3 before?
2011-11-02T14:12:00.000Z	dmb__	cablop	for about 30 seconds on 11.04 before I began to feel physically sick and switched back to gnome
2011-11-02T14:13:00.000Z	cablop	dmb__	no more gnome 2.x in 11.10
2011-11-02T14:13:00.000Z	dmb__	cablop	I bet I can build it ;-)
2011-11-02T14:13:00.000Z	cablop	dmb__	i think there's a ppa for that somewhere
2011-11-02T14:14:00.000Z	cablop	dmb__	a PPA is like a repo, but smaller and simplier
2011-11-02T14:14:00.000Z	dmb__	cablop	ic
2011-11-02T14:16:00.000Z	dmb__	cablop	devi: sorry if I came across as rude
2011-11-02T14:19:00.000Z	cablop	dmb__	it is going to provide you some docks for your system, but it looks like the best gnome panel replacement ever
