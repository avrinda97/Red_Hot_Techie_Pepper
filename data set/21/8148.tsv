2007-10-09T09:58:00.000Z	john_doe	erUSUL	thanks, but I don't have any problems with my onboard card.
2007-10-09T09:58:00.000Z	john_doe	erUSUL	it's not sound in general, it's using two cards....
2010-01-02T17:49:00.000Z	john_doe	erUSUL	sure
2010-01-02T17:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	john_doe	can you post the exact mplayer error message ?
2010-01-02T17:54:00.000Z	john_doe	erUSUL	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d1ddc9277
2010-01-02T17:55:00.000Z	john_doe	erUSUL	notice that the pulse problem is when using sudo where the output is fine
2010-01-02T17:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	john_doe	have you checked that the audio is not muted in pulseaudio ?? silly but would be not the firs time
2010-01-02T17:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	john_doe	right click on the volume icon
2010-01-02T17:56:00.000Z	john_doe	erUSUL	no, I haven't
2010-01-02T17:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	john_doe	open the volume manager and check all sliders too
2010-01-02T17:56:00.000Z	john_doe	erUSUL	it must be a command line solution
2010-01-02T17:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	john_doe	with mplayer playing that's it
2010-01-02T17:59:00.000Z	john_doe	erUSUL	I don't have a graphical interface. can I unmute pulseaudio from bash?
2010-01-02T18:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	john_doe	try alsamixer
2010-01-02T18:03:00.000Z	john_doe	erUSUL	alright. It surprises me that it's not installed. Is that weird to you too?
2010-01-02T18:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	john_doe	well dunno; i upgrade. maybe a clean install wont include it becouse pulseaudio
2010-01-02T18:05:00.000Z	john_doe	erUSUL	(I upgraded too). it's a usb card. it doesn't have any mixer elements so alsamixer doesn't start. I suppose it's a software layer I need to unmute. I thought that would be pulseaudio.
2010-01-02T18:08:00.000Z	john_doe	erUSUL	got it. pulseaudio used the wrong audio device. Changed it with pavucontrol
2010-01-02T18:09:00.000Z	john_doe	erUSUL	thanks for helping me out!
2010-01-02T18:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	john_doe	no problem
