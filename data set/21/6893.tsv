2007-01-07T06:39:00.000Z	Wakeskat	BackPacker	my computer froze when i typed that command
2007-01-07T06:40:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	well, again there might be something in /var/log/messages... You've really got problems with that box, haven't you? I can see you reinstalling soon...
2007-01-07T06:41:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	Have you tried turning beryl off? (if that's possible)
2007-01-07T06:41:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	you mean the 'less' command? 'less /var/log/messages' or 'less ~/.xsession-errors'
2007-01-07T06:42:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	but you said you didn't have the 'less' command installed
2007-01-07T06:42:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	oh well, one less mistake  :-)
2007-01-07T06:43:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	OK
2007-01-07T06:43:00.000Z	Wakeskat	BackPacker	http://rafb.net/p/nwRo9297.html
2007-01-07T06:44:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	Is that all of it? Just 22 lines?
2007-01-07T06:45:00.000Z	Wakeskat	BackPacker	 i cant get it to go up anymore
2007-01-07T06:45:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	What you posted shows that the machine went down, but doesn't give any indication as to why
2007-01-07T06:46:00.000Z	Wakeskat	BackPacker	how do i scroll up in the terminal. page up wont work and theres nothing to slide
2007-01-07T06:46:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	hold down the shift key and use the up/down arrows and PageUP, PageDn
2007-01-07T06:47:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	Unless anyone else has any ideas...
2007-01-07T06:48:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	Whatever is causing it isn't putting any helpful messages anywhere
2007-01-07T06:48:00.000Z	Wakeskat	BackPacker	http://rafb.net/p/TxQ2dy77.html
2007-01-07T06:49:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	Again, line 12 shows that the machine went down, but again there's no indication as to why
2007-01-07T06:54:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	Try checking out /var/log/kernel/errors using the less command
2007-01-07T06:55:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	Forgot to say, you need to use sudo: sudo less /var/log/kernel/errors
2007-01-07T06:56:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	you don't have a /var/log/kernel/errors file?
2007-01-07T06:59:00.000Z	BackPacker	Wakeskat	that's the one. But I have to say right now, I'm not sure I'd know what to look for
