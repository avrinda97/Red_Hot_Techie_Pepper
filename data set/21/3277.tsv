2009-02-10T00:26:00.000Z	jacksonhyde		sweet...now it's ubuntu time.
2009-02-10T00:26:00.000Z	jacksonhyde		thanks for all your help guys - I got one more question actually..
2009-02-10T00:27:00.000Z	jacksonhyde		Does anyone have any experience of using a D-LINK DWL-G650 wifi card with the Madwifi drivers and 8.10?
2009-02-10T00:27:00.000Z	kavity	jacksonhyde	I use the madwifi driver, but I don't have that card.
2009-02-10T00:27:00.000Z	jacksonhyde		On the madwifi site it says it runs on 7.10 (downloading as we speak...), but I'd love to use Ibex.
2009-02-10T00:28:00.000Z	kavity	jacksonhyde	The reason I stopped using ubuntu to go to another distro was because ibex wouldn't use my atheros(runs on madwifi) card, and I got annoyed, but this install it works fine, same laptop(just a few months later)
2009-02-10T00:28:00.000Z	jacksonhyde		weird...
2009-02-10T00:28:00.000Z	jacksonhyde		I dunno how much gyp I get from my missus if I installed Linux on her laptop though...
2009-02-10T00:29:00.000Z	jacksonhyde		she gets annoyed when I tell her to boot up Firefox on my mac. :)
2009-02-10T00:29:00.000Z	kavity	jacksonhyde	You could install a virtual PC thing on windows, if you just want to try it out.
2009-02-10T00:29:00.000Z	jacksonhyde		She says "Where's the internet?" (looking for a small ugly blue 'e' icon...
2009-02-10T00:29:00.000Z	kavity		Also, you could change your icons for her. :)
2009-02-10T00:29:00.000Z	jacksonhyde		ali: yeah? got a link?
2009-02-10T00:29:00.000Z	jacksonhyde	kavity	heh..genius!
