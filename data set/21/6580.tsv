2007-03-06T17:28:00.000Z	PirateHead	juice`	can you install anything?
2007-03-06T17:29:00.000Z	PirateHead	juice`	like, for example, knoppix?
2007-03-06T17:29:00.000Z	PirateHead	juice`	microsoft does NOT have a microkernel
2007-03-06T17:29:00.000Z	PirateHead	juice`	unless something changed recently...?
2007-03-06T17:31:00.000Z	juice`	PirateHead	yes, i can install anything, like debian, but not ubuntu
2007-03-06T17:46:00.000Z	PirateHead	juice`	I hate Gigabyte stuff. =P
2007-03-06T17:46:00.000Z	PirateHead	juice`	get a nice FIC motherboard
2007-03-06T17:47:00.000Z	juice`	PirateHead	i just bought it and it's nice ;)
2007-03-06T17:47:00.000Z	juice`	PirateHead	XBitlabs reviewed it high, and i personally think it's good motherboard. quite cheap for what i get
2007-03-06T17:48:00.000Z	PirateHead	juice`	I have no loyalty. =P
2007-03-06T17:49:00.000Z	PirateHead	juice`	 besides, Ubuntu is based on Debian, uses many of the same programs as Debian does, etc. Debian is well-established as a high-quality OS.
2007-03-06T17:50:00.000Z	PirateHead	juice`	it's a real shame that it won't Just Work(tm), and unforunately I have no experience relevant to how you might get things working. I hope somebody answers your forum post.
2007-03-06T06:21:00.000Z	PirateHead	juice`	evidently, few people understand the problem
2007-03-06T06:21:00.000Z	PirateHead	juice`	you need to find or submit a relevant bugzilla entry, not rely on the unofficial forums
2007-03-06T06:22:00.000Z	PirateHead	juice`	if you find an old bugzilla entry, try to get the train moving again by sending out a few emails
2007-03-06T06:25:00.000Z	juice`	PirateHead	ok, i will try that
2007-03-06T06:27:00.000Z	juice`	PirateHead	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub/+bug/64574
2007-03-06T06:32:00.000Z	PirateHead	juice`	have you tried using LILO?
2007-03-06T06:32:00.000Z	PirateHead	juice`	might that possibly help anything?
