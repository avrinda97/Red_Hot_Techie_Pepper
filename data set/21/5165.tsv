2011-09-24T16:23:00.000Z	todd_		DerHeks: How do you run cheese to take a single picture? I cant seem to find the man pages for command line arguments?
2011-09-24T16:24:00.000Z	todd_		lol
2011-09-24T16:24:00.000Z	todd_		I am looking for a command that I can execute that will take a single picture from my webcam, BUT I want it to prompt the user with a preview so they can be sure its in frame... help!?
2011-09-24T16:26:00.000Z	todd_		DerHeks: No I want to take 1 and only one pic, but I only want it taken when the persons face is in frame, not 1/2 off the screen
2011-09-24T16:26:00.000Z	todd_		DerHeks: Make sense?
2011-09-24T16:28:00.000Z	soreau	todd_	streamer -f jpeg -o /path/to/image.jpeg then script it to show you the image and do what you want
2011-09-24T16:28:00.000Z	todd_	soreau	No streamer takes a picture immediatly, so the person Im taking a pic of is probably 1/2 out of frame, is there a way to get it to wait till the person is in frame?
2011-09-24T16:29:00.000Z	soreau	todd_	There is no program to do that. You just have to take the pic, open it to view it and decide if its acceptable then delete and repeat if not etc
2011-09-24T16:30:00.000Z	soreau	todd_	You need to write a script to suit your needs
2011-09-24T16:32:00.000Z	soreau	todd_	take pic, open it to view, if acceptable, enter y, else enter n and have it delete the image and start at step one
2011-09-24T16:34:00.000Z	soreau	todd_	You are making this way more difficult than what it is
2011-09-24T16:34:00.000Z	soreau	todd_	There are a plethora of tools and ways to do this. Get creative.
2011-09-24T16:35:00.000Z	todd_	soreau	OK simplify it for me... please :-)
2011-09-24T16:35:00.000Z	soreau	todd_	In one word? Cheese.
2011-09-24T16:35:00.000Z	todd_	soreau	OK how do I know when the picture was taken with cheese?
2011-09-24T16:35:00.000Z	soreau	todd_	You will have to try it and find out for yourself
2011-09-24T16:36:00.000Z	todd_	soreau	ok so you are giving me advice about something you really do not know about,... thanks :-(
2011-09-24T16:37:00.000Z	soreau	todd_	The point is that you need to try things and figure it out. My do a web search with google about exactly what you want
2011-09-24T16:38:00.000Z	todd_	soreau	Obviously, and I did that, I would not waste your time on something I did not try and research first
2011-09-24T16:38:00.000Z	soreau	todd_	You arent the first one to use a webcam on linux
2011-09-24T16:39:00.000Z	todd_	soreau	obviously, and I dont appreciate being talked down to
