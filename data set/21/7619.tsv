2006-08-21T16:52:00.000Z	dbernar1	inzoy	you read the wpa supplicant howto?
2006-08-21T16:53:00.000Z	dbernar1	inzoy	show us what you did, what you read, and what the issue was with what you were following.
2006-08-21T16:57:00.000Z	dbernar1	inzoy	what steps did you go through?
2006-08-21T05:00:00.000Z	dbernar1	inzoy	are you sure wpasupplicant is installed?
2006-08-21T05:02:00.000Z	dbernar1	inzoy	you have the network manager installed?
2006-08-21T05:03:00.000Z	dbernar1	inzoy	and do you see the network manager?
2006-08-21T05:03:00.000Z	inzoy	dbernar1	hmm yes
2006-08-21T05:05:00.000Z	dbernar1	inzoy	and using network manager does nothing for you?
2006-08-21T05:06:00.000Z	dbernar1	inzoy	it says to just use the net manager for wpa
2006-08-21T05:07:00.000Z	dbernar1	inzoy	you went through Edit /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf to include your network.?
2006-08-21T05:09:00.000Z	dbernar1	inzoy	no, it needs no wpasuppluicant. just follow the last instructions I gave you if you had not.
2006-08-21T05:13:00.000Z	dbernar1	inzoy	did you listen to what I said?
2006-08-21T05:15:00.000Z	inzoy	dbernar1	what exactly should i do?
