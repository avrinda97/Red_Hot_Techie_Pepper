2006-03-31T12:24:00.000Z	unforgettableid	clever	no

2006-03-31T12:24:00.000Z	unforgettableid	clever	tail in 1, access video in the other.
2006-03-31T12:30:00.000Z	unforgettableid	clever	oh. :(
2006-03-31T12:31:00.000Z	unforgettableid	clever	do you use screen(1)
2006-03-31T12:32:00.000Z	unforgettableid	clever	it wouldve showed up in syslog.
2006-03-31T12:35:00.000Z	clever	unforgettableid	my kernel had a panic attack
2006-03-31T12:35:00.000Z	unforgettableid	clever	really?
2006-03-31T12:35:00.000Z	unforgettableid	clever	use a different kernel.
2006-03-31T12:36:00.000Z	unforgettableid	clever	then that was smart of you to use c-a-F1, i wouldnt have thought of it.
2006-03-31T12:45:00.000Z	unforgettableid	clever	that sucks. try google for the exact panic message. if you cant see it use 80x50. if no luck try the newest kernel from kernel.org. if no luck, try the appropriate mailing list, kernel or v4l.
2006-03-31T12:54:00.000Z	unforgettableid	clever	get another
2006-03-31T12:55:00.000Z	unforgettableid	clever	maybe there are kernel binaries available.
