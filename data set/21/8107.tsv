2007-11-19T01:04:00.000Z	Maximus		how does one find out what version of grub they have?
2007-11-19T01:04:00.000Z	Pelo	Maximus	 you have grub one,  grub 2 isn'T realy final yet
2007-11-19T01:05:00.000Z	Maximus	Pelo	are you good with grub because the guys in #grub always ask, can you reproduce the prob. with grub 2......
2007-11-19T01:06:00.000Z	Pelo	Maximus	 I can help some but tell me the problem first , concisely
2007-11-19T01:07:00.000Z	Maximus	Pelo	system wont boot, i was getting error #17 my menu.1st and device.map are at http://pastebin.ubuntu-nl.org/45050 and http://pastebin.ubuntu-nl.org/45051
2007-11-19T01:08:00.000Z	Pelo	Maximus	hold on , let me have a look
2007-11-19T01:09:00.000Z	Maximus	Pelo	I have 1 ide drive and 2 sata which i set up as mdraid0, i used the first 512mb of each drive as /boot and swap, then used the free space left on each to create the raid
2007-11-19T01:09:00.000Z	Pelo	Maximus	do you get as far as the grub boot menu ?
2007-11-19T01:09:00.000Z	Maximus	Pelo	no
2007-11-19T01:10:00.000Z	Pelo	Maximus	 did you play around with the boot order of your hdd in the bios ? change it and try , let me know how it goes
2007-11-19T01:11:00.000Z	Maximus	Pelo	I have boot option as sata, i tried changing it to hdd 0 but still no boot
2007-11-19T01:11:00.000Z	Pelo	Maximus	which hdd is windows on ?
2007-11-19T01:12:00.000Z	Maximus	Pelo	 if it helps the ide drive is hdc and the sata are sda and sdb, and i believe its picking them up in that order
2007-11-19T01:13:00.000Z	Pelo	Maximus	from what I am reading in your menu.lst file the windows hdd should be the one set to boot in the bios,  make sure that is the case
2007-11-19T01:13:00.000Z	Maximus	Pelo	no windows, thats a storage drive with ntfs file system, i dont know where it got the other os from, unless i had windows on that drive sometime or other...?
2007-11-19T01:13:00.000Z	Maximus	Pelo	give me a minute to go double check it
2007-11-19T01:14:00.000Z	Pelo	Maximus	 ok , I think I have the general idea now,  you're gonna need the supergrub cd  to make sure that the phase one is on the correct hdd and that it point to phase2 ( menu.lst) on the correct partiton,   check the last link on the msg taht ubotu will give you , toward the bottom of the page is a link for the cd's iso , just burn and bood from it, several menues will help you fix the problem
2007-11-19T01:17:00.000Z	Maximus	Pelo	ok, i will check out that page
2007-11-19T01:28:00.000Z	Maximus	Pelo	are you familiar with super grub?  i don't know if i should pick automatic or the advanced
2007-11-19T01:30:00.000Z	Pelo	Maximus	 I used it once long ago,  you need to do two things,  tell it where to set phase one ( on the boot hdd) and tell it where the /boot/grub/menu.lst file is located ,   not sure how it is worded in the supergrub cd I don'T remember ,  just look around I recall it's not overly confusing
2007-11-19T01:58:00.000Z	Maximus	Pelo	i must be stupid cause i cant figure it out :)
