2011-08-28T20:31:00.000Z	volga629	o0splitpaw0o	that was a mistake install new kernel :-(
2011-08-28T20:33:00.000Z	o0splitpaw0o	volga629	 well possibly no, might of been an update that is all
2011-08-28T20:34:00.000Z	volga629	o0splitpaw0o	yes the problem my laptop down for 2 second day and I don't see solution
2011-08-28T20:35:00.000Z	o0splitpaw0o	volga629	I'd run sudo apt-get -f install. anything damaged or misisng will be pulled, but from those massaged, accessing ca.ubuntu.com timing out  I assume a network side issue. not on your side, but to that url whereever it's trying to pull that update from
2011-08-28T20:37:00.000Z	o0splitpaw0o	volga629	I would connect it via a network cable to the network and run that to repair it. if you have no connection, then check if network is connecting by typing in sudo ifconfig eth0
2011-08-28T20:38:00.000Z	volga629	o0splitpaw0o	the question right now how to restore the nvidia driver
2011-08-28T20:38:00.000Z	o0splitpaw0o	volga629	should show you an ip there.
2011-08-28T20:39:00.000Z	volga629	o0splitpaw0o	is no internet connection problem I am be able go to internet, and network up and running
2011-08-28T20:40:00.000Z	o0splitpaw0o	volga629	you can do this. reboot it. at the prompt select "ubuntu recovery mode" > Then select load default driver> This will load a basic vga driver for you. at the login prompt> select "ubuntu classic" (or it will just tell you it has to load into classic mode by default)> Then once in goto System>Administration> Additional Drivers> Select the Recommended Nvidia Driver and apply changes> Then reboot
2011-08-28T20:41:00.000Z	volga629	o0splitpaw0o	that like a solution let me try thank you
2011-08-28T20:42:00.000Z	o0splitpaw0o	volga629	Then it's just a bad repository it's trying to access right now. run sudo apt-get --autoremove and it will remove conflicting packages and get you stable
2011-08-28T20:44:00.000Z	volga629	o0splitpaw0o	let me try reocevery mode
2011-08-28T20:45:00.000Z	volga629	o0splitpaw0o	sudo apt-get -f install nvidia-173-kernel-source  ----> this is solution
