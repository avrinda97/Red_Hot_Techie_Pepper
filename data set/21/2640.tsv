2009-08-11T01:06:00.000Z	VCoolio	{DJ}	yes, pretty much all of us are running python, you already do if you run update manager
2009-08-11T01:06:00.000Z	{DJ}	VCoolio	are you running python 2.6
2009-08-11T01:07:00.000Z	VCoolio	{DJ}	also, yes; but these are not helpful questions
2009-08-11T01:07:00.000Z	VCoolio	{DJ}	what do you want to do and what's the problem?
2009-08-11T01:08:00.000Z	{DJ}	VCoolio	I just want to upgrade to python 2.6 in order to get Pyzor working
2009-08-11T01:08:00.000Z	{DJ}	VCoolio	so the main point here is to upgrade to python 2.6
2009-08-11T01:08:00.000Z	{DJ}	VCoolio	can you help
2009-08-11T01:09:00.000Z	VCoolio	{DJ}	check for python2.6 in synaptic
2009-08-11T01:10:00.000Z	VCoolio	{DJ}	behold, you can just "sudo apt-get install python2.6"
2009-08-11T01:11:00.000Z	VCoolio	{DJ}	check your app for other dependencies like pythongtk and stuff
2009-08-11T01:12:00.000Z	VCoolio	{DJ}	are you compiling Pyzor? then you'll also need python2.6-dev
2009-08-11T01:13:00.000Z	{DJ}	VCoolio	Im on Ubuntu LTS any recommendations like sources i can add to apt get install afterwards or do u recommend compiling from source
2009-08-11T01:14:00.000Z	VCoolio	{DJ}	I definitely recommend adding sources instead of compiling; you'll get updates and all; use system > admin > software sources or add /etc/apt/sources.list manually
2009-08-11T01:15:00.000Z	{DJ}	VCoolio	what sources shall i add ? any idea ? sorry for being such a newby
2009-08-11T01:16:00.000Z	VCoolio	{DJ}	sources to add depend on applications / things you want to install, there are lots of them
2009-08-11T01:16:00.000Z	{DJ}	VCoolio	I am running Ubuntu LTS latest version i beleive it was 8 if im not mistaken
2009-08-11T01:19:00.000Z	VCoolio	{DJ}	try to use the stuff that already is in the ubuntu repos, it is safe and stable; if you want newest version or apps or apps that are not in the default, add repos; there is a thread on ubuntuforums in the forum cafe about repos
2009-08-11T01:20:00.000Z	VCoolio	{DJ}	so just look at the apps you use; if you're satisfied, don't bother; if newer versions have features you need, add the repos for it
2009-08-11T01:21:00.000Z	{DJ}	VCoolio	any idea where i can ask for the right repos for python 2.6 ?
2009-08-11T01:25:00.000Z	VCoolio	{DJ}	right here; isn't it in the default repos? isn't it in synaptic
