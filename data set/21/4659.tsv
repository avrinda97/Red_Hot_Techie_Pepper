2009-02-04T21:39:00.000Z	nanotube	woden	ah, in that case, you can use any linux livecd to boot from.
2009-02-04T21:40:00.000Z	nanotube	woden	and no, never heard of erd commander... it seems like it's just your regular livecd, but with windows? :)
2009-02-04T21:40:00.000Z	woden	nanotube	 Yea, but is there a linux program that does what I want?
2009-02-04T21:40:00.000Z	nanotube	woden	yes, it's called a text editor to edit the /etc/passwd file :)
2009-02-04T21:40:00.000Z	woden	nanotube	yea its a livecd with a windows environment, but the thing i want is the app that lets you change admin password on the windows install.
2009-02-04T21:41:00.000Z	woden	nanotube	 No it's a change of the password on the local windows hard drive.
2009-02-04T21:41:00.000Z	nanotube	woden	oh you want to change a /windows/ password using a linux bootcd, is that what youre saying?
2009-02-04T21:41:00.000Z	woden	nanotube	 Yep.
2009-02-04T21:42:00.000Z	nanotube	woden	if it's windows, and erd commander works on it, why not use it?
2009-02-04T21:42:00.000Z	woden	nanotube	 I don't want to use erd commander though.  I want to know if there a program that runs on linux that has the equivalent functionality.
2009-02-04T21:42:00.000Z	nanotube	woden	why are you looknig for something else?
2009-02-04T21:43:00.000Z	nanotube	woden	ah so you have a dual boot system, and you want to access the windows partition and change the password there?
2009-02-04T21:43:00.000Z	woden	nanotube	 Because I have a custom linux live cd that I am using that has a bunch of other tools on it like clonezilla, gparted, and a special shredding program for hard drives, and I want to add this other tool also.
2009-02-04T21:43:00.000Z	nanotube	woden	aha, in that case... you are looking for program called "chntpw"
2009-02-04T21:44:00.000Z	nanotube	woden	(stands for "change nt password" :) )
2009-02-04T21:44:00.000Z	nanotube	woden	see this link for some info: http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml
