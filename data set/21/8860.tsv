2007-04-04T08:39:00.000Z	cookie		Hi all, I have problem installing or removing any packages on my ubuntu-feisty. It complained something with the cluster management system. here is the error message: invoke-rc.d: initscript clvm, action "start" failed.
2007-04-04T08:39:00.000Z	cookie		dpkg: error while cleaning up:
2007-04-04T08:39:00.000Z	cookie		 subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 3
2007-04-04T08:39:00.000Z	cookie		Removing ubuntu-desktop ...

2007-04-04T08:39:00.000Z	cookie		E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
2007-04-04T08:40:00.000Z	cookie		anybody had this issue before?
2007-04-04T08:40:00.000Z	Flannel	cookie	#ubuntu+1 or Feisty support, thanks
2008-03-23T03:12:00.000Z	Flannel	cookie	yes
2008-03-23T03:12:00.000Z	Flannel	cookie	No, that's a security risk
2008-03-23T03:13:00.000Z	cookie	Flannel	Why? I want to know what passwords my user tried to login with(me being an admin)
2008-03-23T03:13:00.000Z	Flannel	cookie	because other users would be the same, (you'd be able to see their failed password attempts) and that would give you hints as to their password (here, or otherwise).
2008-03-23T03:14:00.000Z	cookie	Flannel	Exactly. So could it be possible to modify the sshd logging system to give passwords too?
2008-03-23T03:15:00.000Z	Flannel	cookie	I would hope not.  Since that's really a bad idea.  What do you hope to gain from doing so?
2008-03-23T03:16:00.000Z	cookie	Flannel	Well, for the past 2 days...some fuckers try to connect to my box with users like admin, root and fluffy(wtf?). they connect to me from firewalls and switches
2008-03-23T03:16:00.000Z	cookie	Flannel	all the ip's come from italy
2008-03-23T03:17:00.000Z	Flannel	cookie	knowing the passwords they're trying won't really help.  You should look into denyhosts
2008-03-23T03:17:00.000Z	cookie	Flannel	Yes. And leave them a nice little message. GET THE F*** OUT
2008-03-23T03:18:00.000Z	cookie	Flannel	that is also legal. thanks
2008-03-23T03:18:00.000Z	Flannel	cookie	DenyHosts is in the repositories too, if you didn't notice.
