2007-04-23T08:22:00.000Z	aro	Jahmon	complaining won't make it go faster
2007-04-23T08:23:00.000Z	aro	Jahmon	OK but complaining still won't make it better
2007-04-23T08:39:00.000Z	aro	Jahmon	have you tried www.google.com and searching for your issue to see if others have the same problem?
2007-04-23T08:40:00.000Z	aro	Jahmon	have you tried www.ubuntuforums.org and searching for your issue to see if others have the same problem?
2007-04-23T08:40:00.000Z	aro	Jahmon	I can't just wave a magic wand and make your card install itself
2007-04-23T08:41:00.000Z	aro	Jahmon	I suggested you read forums to see if someone has your issue 20 minutes ago, and you've done nothing but say you hate Linux. In that time you probably could have researched the problem online by now.
2007-04-23T08:41:00.000Z	aro	Jahmon	reading a forum does not require Linux expertise.
2007-04-23T08:41:00.000Z	aro	Jahmon	this is not an official ubuntu IRC channel with paid tech support, these are volunteers.
2007-04-23T08:42:00.000Z	aro	Jahmon	reading forums does not require you to know Linux.
2007-04-23T08:42:00.000Z	aro	Jahmon	searching google does not require you to know Linux/
2007-04-23T08:42:00.000Z	aro	Jahmon	no, but in some cases it takes longer than expected ot get things running.
