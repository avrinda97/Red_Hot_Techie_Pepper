2007-06-08T09:45:00.000Z	rajiv_nair		my system with feisty gets really slow after ive seen some videos in youtube or after ive played some flv files from my hardisk using totem. I have beyl+XGL running and beryl animations also drag considerably. Any solution to this?
2007-06-08T09:46:00.000Z	rajiv_nair		khermans_: i didnt have this problem when i was on dapper :(
2007-06-08T09:47:00.000Z	rajiv_nair		and even now beryl runs smoothly even when sys is heavily loaded as long as i dont touch flash
2007-06-08T09:47:00.000Z	rajiv_nair		and sys continues to drag even after ive closed that particular firefox session or stopped playing an flv
2007-06-08T09:49:00.000Z	rajiv_nair		cpu disk and mem everythin seems fine if  go with the numbers shown in system monitor
2007-06-08T09:49:00.000Z	adelie	rajiv_nair	sounds like a caching issue. are you using firefox for playing videos?
2007-06-08T09:49:00.000Z	rajiv_nair	adelie	firefox just for youtube
2007-06-08T09:51:00.000Z	adelie	rajiv_nair	try clearing the cache from the tools menu
2007-06-08T09:53:00.000Z	rajiv_nair	adelie	problem still there
2007-06-08T09:53:00.000Z	adelie	rajiv_nair	only other work around I can think is look for flash process and kill it / restart.
2007-06-08T09:54:00.000Z	rajiv_nair	adelie	system restart works fine :D, but i dont wanna reboot my sys every single time i watch something on youtube :((
2007-06-08T09:54:00.000Z	adelie	rajiv_nair	try to find a process hogging lots of resources and kill it
2007-06-08T09:57:00.000Z	rajiv_nair	adelie	will do
2007-06-08T09:57:00.000Z	rajiv_nair	adelie	switched to metacity and back to beryl
2007-06-08T09:59:00.000Z	rajiv_nair	adelie	yes AIGLX is there. but my card is an ATI and propreitary ATI drivers dont support AIGLX
2007-06-08T10:05:00.000Z	rajiv_nair	adelie	nvidia driver??..me on ATI
2007-06-08T10:06:00.000Z	rajiv_nair	adelie	but ATI drivers dosent support AIGLX
2007-06-08T10:07:00.000Z	rajiv_nair	adelie	:) ??
2007-06-08T10:08:00.000Z	rajiv_nair	adelie	and how do i do force restart XGL without logging out?
2007-06-08T10:11:00.000Z	rajiv_nair	adelie	"sudo top -bn1 | grep XGL" didnt return anything
2007-06-08T10:12:00.000Z	rajiv_nair	adelie	but the thought of having to do it after watching a video on youtube everytime :(
