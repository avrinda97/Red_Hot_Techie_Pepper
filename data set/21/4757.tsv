2008-08-06T14:14:00.000Z	db92		shouldnt apt-get install linux-source-2.6.24 gimme the latest 2.6.24, or at least the one i have installed? i just apt-get install linux-source-2.6.24 and im on 2.6.24-19 but it gave me sources for 2.6.24-3 :||||
2008-08-06T14:14:00.000Z	wols_	db92	3 is lower than 19
2008-08-06T14:14:00.000Z	db92	wols_	thats what im talking about :|||
2008-08-06T14:14:00.000Z	wols_	db92	and what are your deb-src lines?
2008-08-06T14:16:00.000Z	db92	wols_	i dunno exactly how you mean it, but every line i got is of this style deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ hardy-security main restricted and they are all uncommented :p
2008-08-06T14:16:00.000Z	wols_	db92	I want to know all your deb-src lines. I say what I mean
2008-08-06T14:16:00.000Z	wols_	db92	you are most likely lacking such a line for security updates
2008-08-06T14:16:00.000Z	db92	wols_	i suppose a paste of the sources.list would then suffice :||
2008-08-06T14:17:00.000Z	db92	wols_	http://pastebin.com/f669880d7
2008-08-06T14:19:00.000Z	wols_	db92	http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/linux-image-2.6.24-19-generic asd you can see there, the source exists in the repos
2008-08-06T14:21:00.000Z	wols_	db92	then your packages lists are out of date or there are errors when you update them
2008-08-06T14:21:00.000Z	wols_	db92	delete them all and apt-get update again
2008-08-06T14:27:00.000Z	wols_	db92	apt-cache policy linux-source-2.6.24
2008-08-06T14:28:00.000Z	wols_	db92	pastebin the apt-cache output please
2008-08-06T14:31:00.000Z	wols_	db92	pastebin?
2008-08-06T14:32:00.000Z	db92	wols_	of the apt-cache?
2008-08-06T14:32:00.000Z	db92	wols_	or whatever? :p
2008-08-06T14:36:00.000Z	wols_	db92	I am still waiting for the paste
2008-08-06T14:37:00.000Z	db92	wols_	of what ffs?
2008-08-06T14:37:00.000Z	db92	wols_	the last paste you asked for i gave :|||
