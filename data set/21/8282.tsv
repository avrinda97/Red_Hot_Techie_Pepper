2006-05-19T06:17:00.000Z	deus_		how can i get the chroot system to read the mounted cdrom?
2006-05-19T06:18:00.000Z	high-freq	deus_	should be the same... mount /dev/??? /mnt/???
2006-05-19T06:19:00.000Z	deus_	high-freq	well its not, it wont mount on /chroot/media/cdrom
2006-05-19T06:19:00.000Z	high-freq	deus_	well if your chrooted then your basically in your system.... so just do  mount /dev/??? /media/cdrom
2006-05-19T06:21:00.000Z	deus_	high-freq	well i im in the chroot there is no fstab to use is there?
2006-05-19T06:22:00.000Z	high-freq	deus_	did u have a previous install?  if so when u say when your chrooted..that means u are now in your system...should be in /etc/fstab  see if u have that
2006-05-19T06:22:00.000Z	deus_	high-freq	what i mean is that i wasnt told to copy the fstab from my original system to the chroot
2006-05-19T06:24:00.000Z	high-freq	deus_	is this a new hd install or somethin?  cuz i'm still not gettin you...when u chroot into your hd...then you should see 'everything' that you have installed...the base system and all
2006-05-19T06:24:00.000Z	deus_	high-freq	when im in the chroot i cant see the base system, the root is then /chroot
2006-05-19T06:25:00.000Z	high-freq	deus_	chroot is there for those that need to fix their system...so they load a liveCD and chroot into their system and that means you are now on using your hd like you first boot up...
2006-05-19T06:25:00.000Z	deus_	high-freq	hmm, this is a 32-bits chroot
2006-05-19T06:26:00.000Z	high-freq	deus_	weird....what bout /chroot/etc/fstab?  is that there?
2006-05-19T06:26:00.000Z	deus_	high-freq	well as i said, i didnt create one, because i wasnt told to, i dont know the consquence of that
2006-05-19T06:27:00.000Z	deus_	high-freq	i do have a fstab file but its empty
2006-05-19T06:27:00.000Z	high-freq	deus_	every install auto creates it
2006-05-19T06:27:00.000Z	high-freq	deus_	do  cat /chroot/etc/fstab
2006-05-19T06:28:00.000Z	deus_	high-freq	nevermind
2006-05-19T06:30:00.000Z	high-freq	deus_	are u using the liveCD?
2006-05-19T06:31:00.000Z	deus_	high-freq	no im not using a liveCD, im using a folder that got system files in it, 32 bit versions, so i cant use mplayer with all its glory in my amd64 system
2006-05-19T06:35:00.000Z	deus_	high-freq	i gotta go, thanks for the attention anyway
2006-05-19T06:35:00.000Z	high-freq	deus_	ya sorry bud...didn't really know what u meant by chroot....only to fix your system is what i kinda know...
