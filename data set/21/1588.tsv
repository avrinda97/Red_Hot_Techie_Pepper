2011-09-19T20:45:00.000Z	hidensoft	tensorpudding	ok thanks
2011-09-19T20:36:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hidensoft	that PPA doesn't support natty
2011-09-19T20:36:00.000Z	hidensoft	tensorpudding	so what i can do ?
2011-09-19T20:36:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hidensoft	maybe
2011-09-19T20:37:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hidensoft	you might need to fork his packages
2011-09-19T20:38:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hidensoft	obviously, the guy who made that PPA has abandoned it, the last time new versions passed was a year ago
2011-09-19T20:38:00.000Z	hidensoft	tensorpudding	can you tell me how or give me a link ?
2011-09-19T20:38:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hidensoft	there's no easy route to packaging
2011-09-19T20:39:00.000Z	hidensoft	tensorpudding	so there is no way to installing pdt on ubuntu 11.4 ?
2011-09-19T20:39:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hidensoft	you can install the packages that are provided with eclipse
2011-09-19T20:40:00.000Z	hidensoft	tensorpudding	so there is no way with apt-get :)
2011-09-19T20:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hidensoft	yes
2011-09-19T20:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hidensoft	well
2011-09-19T20:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hidensoft	you can do what the guy who did that PPA did, and take the upstream and package them
2011-09-19T20:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hidensoft	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Complete
2011-09-19T20:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hidensoft	it's pretty daunting
2011-09-19T20:43:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hidensoft	given that someone else did the hard work of writing packages, adapting them to natty//oneiric wouldn't be impossible
2011-09-19T20:44:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hidensoft	a PPA is a place with packages
2011-09-19T20:44:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hidensoft	they're hosted at LP, the site for Ubuntu development
2011-09-19T20:44:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hidensoft	https://launchpad.net/~yogarine/+archive/eclipse is the site for the PPA you were using
