2006-12-19T11:01:00.000Z	leobloom		ehm for those of you who don't know Italian it says that the libgutenprintuil is not installable coz it's not complete
2006-12-19T11:01:00.000Z	jrib	leobloom	what version of ubuntu? what are you trying to install? Pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list please
2006-12-19T11:02:00.000Z	jrib	leobloom	type 'gedit /etc/apt/sources.list' in a terminal then copy and paste into http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org, then give us a url
2006-12-19T11:05:00.000Z	jrib	leobloom	no, you made a typo
2006-12-19T11:06:00.000Z	jrib	leobloom	space after "gedit"
2006-12-19T11:11:00.000Z	jrib	leobloom	apt-cache policy cinepaint
2006-12-19T11:12:00.000Z	jrib	leobloom	yes, then pastebin the output
2006-12-19T11:14:00.000Z	jrib	leobloom	try to put my name in your replies or I'll miss them
2006-12-19T11:15:00.000Z	leobloom	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37928/
2006-12-19T11:15:00.000Z	jrib	leobloom	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cinepaint
2006-12-19T11:17:00.000Z	leobloom	jrib	I've  typed that and it always tells me that the problem is with that lib
2006-12-19T11:19:00.000Z	jrib	leobloom	see https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/cinepaint/+bug/75020
2006-12-19T11:19:00.000Z	leobloom	jrib	should I do something else? Dunno, what if I tried to manually install that lib? do you think it'd work?
2006-12-19T11:20:00.000Z	jrib	leobloom	find out if cinepaint really needs that dependency.  If it doesn't then i would download the source pacakge, remove the deb, and rebuild it
2006-12-19T11:21:00.000Z	jrib	leobloom	I'll walk you through, it's simple.  But find out if it really requires that dependency first
2006-12-19T11:26:00.000Z	jrib	leobloom	here's a better bug report: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/cinepaint/+bug/65457
2006-12-19T11:27:00.000Z	jrib	leobloom	that one is "fix released" :)
