2005-04-03T16:01:00.000Z	Redwraith111		has anyone had any x problems? like going to tty2 then back to 7 and the system crashes
2005-04-03T16:01:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	Redwraith111	that would be a video driver/hardware problem
2005-04-03T16:01:00.000Z	Redwraith111		like the fglrx?
2005-04-03T16:01:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	Redwraith111	older/less-supported video cards often have that sort of problem
2005-04-03T16:01:00.000Z	Redwraith111		that i installed
2005-04-03T16:02:00.000Z	Redwraith111		also.. if i log out i get stuck at a black screen?
2005-04-03T16:02:00.000Z	Redwraith111		like from gnome?
2005-04-03T16:02:00.000Z	Redwraith111		and i cant do anything?
2005-04-03T16:02:00.000Z	Redwraith111		vid card aswell?
2005-04-03T16:03:00.000Z	Redwraith111	Quinn_Storm	could that me it aswell?
2005-04-03T16:03:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	Redwraith111	not sure about the log-out problem
2005-04-03T16:03:00.000Z	Redwraith111		I think x is broked
2005-04-03T16:03:00.000Z	Redwraith111		lol
2005-04-03T16:03:00.000Z	Redwraith111		Im going to format
2005-04-03T16:03:00.000Z	Redwraith111		Also I cannot switch back to tty2 Quinn_Storm
2005-04-03T16:04:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	Redwraith111	well, it sounds like it probably is a vid card/driver problem
2005-04-03T16:04:00.000Z	Redwraith111		can i fix it?
2005-04-03T16:04:00.000Z	Redwraith111		i have the fglrx
2005-04-03T16:04:00.000Z	Redwraith111		the ubuntu package
2005-04-03T16:05:00.000Z	Redwraith111		if I modprobe fglrx Quinn_Storm and it doesnt say anything does that mean those drivers are loaded and im not in Vesa?
2005-04-03T16:05:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	Redwraith111	not sure
