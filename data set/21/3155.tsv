2011-02-04T06:41:00.000Z	Brandon___		Hi, everyone. I'm using the Wubi installer on a raid 0 system and am getting an error that states the root filesystem isn't defined.
2011-02-04T06:42:00.000Z	Brandon___		Anyone have a solution to this?
2011-02-04T06:43:00.000Z	Brandon___		er, 8 GB ram I mean
2011-02-04T06:45:00.000Z	Brandon___		So, does anyone have a solution to the root file system error on a wubi install?
2011-02-04T06:46:00.000Z	Brandon___		Anyone here familiar with Wubi at all?
2011-02-04T06:48:00.000Z	Brandon___		That was kinda rude
2011-02-04T06:48:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Brandon___	you might have an NTFS error. Sorry, I don't know the debugging, that's a Windows filesystem it sits on
2011-02-04T06:50:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Brandon___	I set up a laptop for work with wubi, and had a problem with my filesystem. I had to reinstall -- lost what I had, which was no big deal for me.
2011-02-04T06:52:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Brandon___	partitioning is a good thing. If I wanted to run Wubi again I'd give it it's own D: drive
2011-02-04T06:57:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Brandon___	you change any entries in the Windows boot loader? It sounds like an entry in there is pointing to something moved or nonexistent
2011-02-04T06:57:00.000Z	Brandon___	jimcooncat	it's an entry that Wubi puts in itself
2011-02-04T06:58:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Brandon___	yes, it makes an entry in there.
2011-02-04T06:58:00.000Z	Brandon___	jimcooncat	that's what I'm saying
2011-02-04T07:00:00.000Z	Brandon___	jimcooncat	Using a RAID 0
2011-02-04T07:01:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Brandon___	that makes me suspect an NTFS error even more. You may want to run fsck or chkdsk or scandisk or whatever can check errors on the filesystem. RAID0 can introduce errors, though normal Windows usage can too.
2011-02-04T07:03:00.000Z	Brandon___	jimcooncat	that's the basics. I've re-created the raid and even reinstalled win just to see if it'd have any affect
2011-02-04T07:06:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Brandon___	reinstalling windows and rebuilding the raid must have wiped out the wubi file -- or did you restore it?
2011-02-04T07:06:00.000Z	Brandon___	jimcooncat	I reinstalled wubi AFTER the fact, yes.
2011-02-04T07:08:00.000Z	Brandon___	jimcooncat	what would the next approach be?
2011-02-04T07:08:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Brandon___	like I said, check the filesystem. Or commit to a reinstall.
2011-02-04T07:09:00.000Z	Brandon___	jimcooncat	it's been done already and still no juice
