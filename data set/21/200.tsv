2012-11-23T20:21:00.000Z	Kowalczyk		hi. im having a trouble with wireless on my ubuntu laptop. the wireless is working it just doesnt see my wlan essid here at home. mint. slackware.arch and every other sees it. just not ubuntu
2012-11-23T20:22:00.000Z	TJ-	Kowalczyk	What frequency band and standard is the AP using?
2012-11-23T20:23:00.000Z	Kowalczyk	TJ-	2.437GHz channel 6. it stands on automatic. if I change channel the network is unstable.
2012-11-23T20:24:00.000Z	TJ-	Kowalczyk	I'm just checking the obvious things first, bear with me! Is the AP using 40MHz channels (HT a.k.a. 802.11n) ?
2012-11-23T20:25:00.000Z	TJ-	Kowalczyk	OK, so unlikely to be a 'n' thing then. Is the SSID hidden?
2012-11-23T20:25:00.000Z	TJ-	Kowalczyk	At the terminal do you get any result from "sudo iwlist wlan0 scan" (assuming the interface is called wlan0)
2012-11-23T20:26:00.000Z	Kowalczyk	TJ-	no. doesnt show up
2012-11-23T20:26:00.000Z	TJ-	Kowalczyk	I'm hot on this - I spent the entire morning reconfiguring my hostapd 802.11n into n-mode and checking it from the laptop that has an Intel 4965abgn card.
2012-11-23T20:26:00.000Z	Kowalczyk	TJ-	so no go... was the same with 12.04
2012-11-23T20:26:00.000Z	TJ-	Kowalczyk	Is the WLAN card PCI or USB?
2012-11-23T20:27:00.000Z	TJ-	Kowalczyk	Can you check this for me to find its PCI ID: "lspci -nn | egrep -i '(net|eth|wire)'
2012-11-23T20:28:00.000Z	TJ-	Kowalczyk	That's great... now do it again with "lspci -nn" so we can see the PCI Vendor:Product ID :)
2012-11-23T20:29:00.000Z	TJ-	Kowalczyk	great thanks, let me do a quick bit of research
2012-11-23T20:33:00.000Z	TJ-	Kowalczyk	What's the driver? bcrmsmac ?
2012-11-23T20:34:00.000Z	Kowalczyk	TJ-	hmmm. not sure.. or bwl
2012-11-23T20:34:00.000Z	TJ-	Kowalczyk	try lspci -nnvv | grep -A 15 'BCM'
2012-11-23T20:35:00.000Z	Kowalczyk	TJ-	http://pastebin.com/72a1yR7U
2012-11-23T20:39:00.000Z	TJ-	Kowalczyk	The "wl" driver is the Broadcom proprietary driver; did you try the Linux-included brcmsmac previously?
2012-11-23T20:39:00.000Z	Kowalczyk	TJ-	no
2012-11-23T20:40:00.000Z	TJ-	Kowalczyk	I'm assuming you installed the proprietary driver using the package bcmwl-kernel-source ?
2012-11-23T20:40:00.000Z	Kowalczyk	TJ-	yes
