2007-03-05T07:10:00.000Z	TridenT_Boy3555		I feel like I am just someone typing away in a chatroom that ignores me
2007-03-05T07:10:00.000Z	TridenT_Boy3555		How glorious
2007-03-05T07:11:00.000Z	Flannel	TridenT_Boy3555	Your last URL gets cutoff (afer au8), and people hear you.
2007-03-05T07:13:00.000Z	Flannel	TridenT_Boy3555	what USB devices do you have?
2007-03-05T07:14:00.000Z	TridenT_Boy3555	Flannel	USB mouse that's all
2007-03-05T07:15:00.000Z	Flannel	TridenT_Boy3555	Odd.  Try using the alternate CD to install
2007-03-05T07:16:00.000Z	Flannel	TridenT_Boy3555	Instead of the "desktop" (live CD), get the "Alternate" CD
2007-03-05T07:16:00.000Z	TridenT_Boy3555	Flannel	Mine isn't Live :( I couldn't find LIVE CD :(
2007-03-05T07:16:00.000Z	Flannel	TridenT_Boy3555	you have the Desktop CD, that is the liveCD
2007-03-05T07:17:00.000Z	TridenT_Boy3555	Flannel	Uhh...LiveCD=Load to ram and go righto?
2007-03-05T07:18:00.000Z	TridenT_Boy3555	Flannel	Pelo I also have the 64-bit
2007-03-05T07:18:00.000Z	Flannel	TridenT_Boy3555	Right, that's the Desktop CD, you want the alternate CD, same place, literally changing 'desktop' to 'alternate' in that URL *should* get you it
2007-03-05T07:19:00.000Z	TridenT_Boy3555	Flannel	pelo, arrenlex...running out of CDs
