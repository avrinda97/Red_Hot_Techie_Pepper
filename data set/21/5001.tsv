2008-01-25T14:44:00.000Z	un_op	shishio	let's have look at the output you get when you try and start frostwire from the terminal
2008-01-25T14:44:00.000Z	un_op	shishio	use the !pastebin
2008-01-25T14:45:00.000Z	shishio	un_op	it says this line"ls: /opt/j*: No such file or directory
2008-01-25T14:46:00.000Z	shishio	un_op	OOPS, you don't seem to have a valid JRE. FrostWire works best with Sun JRE available at http://www.java.com
2008-01-25T14:47:00.000Z	un_op	shishio	hold on
