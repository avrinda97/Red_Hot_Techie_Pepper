2010-07-29T00:16:00.000Z	jaapz		i have aproblem playing my mp3's
2010-07-29T00:16:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jaapz	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras (type this in a terminal)
2010-07-29T00:16:00.000Z	jaapz	ilovefairuz	already done that
2010-07-29T00:17:00.000Z	jaapz	ilovefairuz	problem is: all players stall when you start playing an mp3
2010-07-29T00:17:00.000Z	jaapz	ilovefairuz	it says its playing but it isnt
2010-07-29T00:18:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jaapz	did you install the extra codecs?
2010-07-29T00:18:00.000Z	jaapz	ilovefairuz	as in: ubuntu-restricted-extras?
2010-07-29T00:19:00.000Z	jaapz	ilovefairuz	if so, yes
2010-07-29T00:20:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jaapz	try running one of them from the command line and see  if it spews any error messages
2010-07-29T00:20:00.000Z	jaapz	ilovefairuz	will try with totem now
2010-07-29T00:21:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jaapz	you can try the 'ffplay' command from ffmpeg
2010-07-29T00:22:00.000Z	jaapz	ilovefairuz	no output at all with the --debug flag
2010-07-29T00:23:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jaapz	in ffplay ?
2010-07-29T00:25:00.000Z	jaapz	ilovefairuz	ffplay is also stuck but without any mentionable output
2010-07-29T00:25:00.000Z	jaapz	ilovefairuz	could you sum up to me what i need to install to play an mp3 file again? ubuntu-restricted-extras, and..?
2010-07-29T00:26:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jaapz	just that
2010-07-29T00:26:00.000Z	jaapz	ilovefairuz	would restarting help?
2010-07-29T00:26:00.000Z	jaapz	ilovefairuz	would be weird
2010-07-29T00:26:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jaapz	no idea but you could try
2010-07-29T00:27:00.000Z	jaapz	ilovefairuz	could it be because i manually compiled alsa 1.0.23?
