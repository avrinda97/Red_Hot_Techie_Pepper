2009-12-16T12:06:00.000Z	tuxd		can someone help me install a tarball.gz?
2009-12-16T12:07:00.000Z	apocalypt	tuxd	what's the problem
2009-12-16T12:07:00.000Z	tuxd	apocalypt	I'm not good a command line
2009-12-16T12:08:00.000Z	tuxd	apocalypt	I got to the dir  [cd dir] and did ./configure... when I try make it won't
2009-12-16T12:09:00.000Z	apocalypt	tuxd	did u read the README?
2009-12-16T12:09:00.000Z	tuxd	apocalypt	 it has an INSTALL file I have open
2009-12-16T12:10:00.000Z	apocalypt	tuxd	u need to compile it. before ./configure , make, make install u need to install build-essentials
2009-12-16T12:12:00.000Z	tuxd	apocalypt	when I was on the ubuntu official documentation pages, the link to 'build-essentials' said I had it installed (though I didn't do it manually myself).   I'm kind of a noob in terms of doing things from scratch.  If it's in the Synaptic, I'm all set, but I want to learn more than that.
2009-12-16T12:13:00.000Z	apocalypt	tuxd	in README there u can read if u need to compile the package or if there is a bash to install this package. at first u have to upack tar.gz with "sudo tar xvfz file.tar.gz"
2009-12-16T12:15:00.000Z	apocalypt	tuxd	did u try to find that package in repository maybe u can install it through apt-get or aptitude from the repository
2009-12-16T12:16:00.000Z	tuxd	apocalypt	is that different from extracting?
2009-12-16T12:17:00.000Z	apocalypt	tuxd	that's complete different because it doesn't use your tar.gz file.it will install a package from repository. which program u want to install?
2009-12-16T12:18:00.000Z	tuxd	apocalypt	 wp tray 0.5.4  wallpaper changer
2009-12-16T12:20:00.000Z	apocalypt	tuxd	try in terminal "sudo aptitude install wallpaper-tray" it could be what u want
2009-12-16T12:23:00.000Z	tuxd	apocalypt	 msg from terminal says "unable to lock administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?"
2009-12-16T12:24:00.000Z	apocalypt	tuxd	close synaptic or the package manager u have open in the X enviroment
2009-12-16T12:29:00.000Z	apocalypt	tuxd	u got it?
2009-12-16T12:30:00.000Z	tuxd	apocalypt	it seemed to do it's thing from terminal, but I'm not sure where to access the program now
2009-12-16T12:30:00.000Z	apocalypt	tuxd	after install the tray should be on your panel
2009-12-16T12:32:00.000Z	tuxd	apocalypt	that's what I thought...but I see date/time, volume, network connection, and screenlet mgr... no new icons
2009-12-16T12:32:00.000Z	apocalypt	tuxd	if it doesn't work try this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=803103 or that https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WallpaperTray
