2008-01-19T19:45:00.000Z	bazhang	mirdin76	just say not to envy
2008-01-19T19:46:00.000Z	mirdin76	bazhang	OK, but i can't install/configure the newer nvidia driver myself
2008-01-23T10:34:00.000Z	bazhang	mirdin76	windows? as in windows xp?
2008-01-23T10:35:00.000Z	mirdin76	bazhang	yeah, ndiswrapper style
2008-01-23T10:36:00.000Z	bazhang	mirdin76	youre asking about how to install windows drivers for windows xp? on #ubuntu ?
2008-01-23T10:37:00.000Z	mirdin76	bazhang	no, friend, I'm trying to understand my failure to load a windows wireless driver using ndiswrapper, or any other way for that matter
2008-01-23T10:38:00.000Z	mirdin76	bazhang	but if I have any Windows XP questions I'll be sure to ask them here first as well
2008-01-23T10:39:00.000Z	bazhang	mirdin76	haha
2008-01-23T10:39:00.000Z	mirdin76	bazhang	haha --ha
2008-04-25T21:39:00.000Z	bazhang	mirdin76	sure it is no problem
2008-04-25T21:40:00.000Z	mirdin76	bazhang	should I back up everything first you think?
2008-04-25T21:40:00.000Z	bazhang	mirdin76	is this via the net or fresh install
2008-04-25T21:41:00.000Z	mirdin76	bazhang	upgrade via the net
2008-04-25T21:41:00.000Z	bazhang	mirdin76	always a good idea to back up crucial data; whether an upgrade or not
2008-04-25T21:43:00.000Z	mirdin76	bazhang	true, I guess I'm wondering if things like fstab setup and like emusicj music downloader will be messed up
2008-04-25T21:43:00.000Z	mirdin76	bazhang	guess one way to find out
2008-04-25T21:44:00.000Z	bazhang	mirdin76	you may want to wait a bit to find out specific info like that--or spend time in here afterwards ;]
2008-04-25T21:44:00.000Z	mirdin76	bazhang	yeah OK thanks
2008-05-02T21:19:00.000Z	bazhang	mirdin76	even the minimal?
2008-05-02T21:23:00.000Z	mirdin76	bazhang	the alternate? yes, even the alternate
2008-05-02T21:24:00.000Z	mirdin76	bazhang	oh, no I don't have any internet connection to it though
