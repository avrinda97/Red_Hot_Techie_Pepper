2006-02-18T15:51:00.000Z	rublind		Is it possible to install ubuntu via floppies?
2006-02-18T15:52:00.000Z	amphi	rublind	ubuntu has no boot floppies
2006-02-18T15:52:00.000Z	rublind	amphi	is there a way to create one or something?
2006-02-18T15:52:00.000Z	amphi	rublind	did the debian base system -> ubuntu thing not work?
2006-02-18T15:52:00.000Z	rublind	amphi	getting debian is proving to be difficult in itself.
2006-02-18T15:53:00.000Z	amphi	rublind	I thought you had debian stable floppy net install going ok for you
2006-02-18T15:53:00.000Z	rublind	amphi	yeah, but that's sarge, and I wanted etch, and to get etech is a big problem, and it just led me in circles.
2006-02-18T15:54:00.000Z	rublind	amphi	what I really want is ubuntu, and I don't know how I'm going to get it.
2006-02-18T15:55:00.000Z	amphi	rublind	did you try installing debian base system, change sources.list, and doing apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade ?
2006-02-18T15:55:00.000Z	amphi	rublind	that's what I'd try
2006-02-18T15:55:00.000Z	amphi	rublind	with sarge
2006-02-18T15:56:00.000Z	rublind	amphi	okay, I'll give that a shot. I'll need the ubuntu sources, I'll ask for them later. :)
2006-02-18T16:04:00.000Z	rublind	amphi	when I'm going to be updating from sarge, will I need to have xorg, kde or gnome already installed?
2006-02-18T16:05:00.000Z	amphi	rublind	no, as I said, my feeling is you want as little debian as possible; just base system
2006-02-18T16:05:00.000Z	rublind	amphi	okay.
2006-02-18T16:05:00.000Z	amphi	rublind	then change you sources.list and apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-02-18T16:06:00.000Z	amphi	rublind	then try apt-get install [k] ubuntu-desktop or whatever
2006-02-18T16:06:00.000Z	rublind	amphi	well, I'm still kind of far from that, so, I'll get back to ya. I'm just trying to stop myself from getting bored.
2006-02-18T16:07:00.000Z	amphi	rublind	heh
2006-02-18T16:27:00.000Z	rublind	amphi	can I pm you?
2006-02-18T16:27:00.000Z	amphi	rublind	sure
