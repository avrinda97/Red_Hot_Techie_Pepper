2011-11-03T13:23:00.000Z	jasef	perlzoc	don't you just have to change 'server' to your server IP, and 'server_port' to the port?
2011-11-03T13:23:00.000Z	jasef	perlzoc	looks like some proxies need 'server_type' as well though
2011-11-03T13:24:00.000Z	jasef	perlzoc	what's the problem with that?
2011-11-03T13:25:00.000Z	perlzoc	jasef	 this is the problem http://pastebin.com/PkjUqfF2
2011-11-03T13:26:00.000Z	jasef	perlzoc	Hmm... seems like it's saying it only wants to play with hosts that are on a local network.
2011-11-03T13:27:00.000Z	jasef	perlzoc	I'm looking to see if it's possible to change this behaviour
2011-11-03T13:28:00.000Z	perlzoc	jasef	 take a look here http://tsocks.sourceforge.net/faq.php#local
2011-11-03T13:28:00.000Z	perlzoc	jasef	 i didn't understand what means
2011-11-03T13:30:00.000Z	jasef	perlzoc	if you make the change I suggested, tell me how it works?
2011-11-03T13:32:00.000Z	perlzoc	jasef	Gtk-Message: (for origin information, set GTK_DEBUG): failed to retrieve property `GtkTreeView::odd-row-color' of type `GdkColor' from rc file value "((GString*) 0x95c3050)" of type `GString'
2011-11-03T13:32:00.000Z	perlzoc	jasef	 and the zattoo player stay blanck
2011-11-03T13:34:00.000Z	jasef	perlzoc	hold on a moment, I'm trying to see what happens when I use the settings, or does your server need authentication?
2011-11-03T13:35:00.000Z	perlzoc	jasef	free swiss proxy server 31.7.60.5:8080
2011-11-03T13:35:00.000Z	perlzoc	jasef	 on my browser works properly setted as proxy 5
2011-11-03T13:39:00.000Z	jasef	perlzoc	funny thing. With my configuration set to your proxy server - I get no errors, but using tsocks on firefox for example doesn't change anything
2011-11-03T13:39:00.000Z	perlzoc	jasef	 can u pastebin your configuration ?
2011-11-03T13:43:00.000Z	jasef	perlzoc	the socks server doesn't seem to be responding at all. I will still paste my configuration however, as it does work. You would still have to change the IP to a working server though, as the one you provided doesn't seem to work. http://paste.ubuntu.com/727085/
2011-11-03T13:45:00.000Z	perlzoc	jasef	 this server works 100% using firefox and foxyproxy s
2011-11-03T13:46:00.000Z	jasef	perlzoc	Are you sure that it's the same IP? And is definitely a SOCKS proxy and not a HTTP proxy?
2011-11-03T13:47:00.000Z	jasef	perlzoc	phlak_user, perhaps it's region restricted.
2011-11-03T13:48:00.000Z	jasef	perlzoc	try the config I linked you too, see if it works for you. Could you also paste the results of inspectsocks 31.7.60.5 8080 ?
