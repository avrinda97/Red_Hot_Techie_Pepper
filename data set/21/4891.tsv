2008-12-01T06:22:00.000Z	histo	MTecknology	then need to enable remote assistance and you just use remote desktop viewer
2008-12-01T06:23:00.000Z	MTecknology	histo	thanks
2008-12-01T06:23:00.000Z	histo	MTecknology	actually terminal server client or rdekstop will work.
2008-12-01T06:23:00.000Z	histo	MTecknology	the other option is they can install some sort of vnc server.  But if they hit start and go to help then click on remote asisstance it will walk them trhough sending an invite etc..
2008-12-01T06:24:00.000Z	MTecknology	histo	how do they request help from my system?
2008-12-01T06:25:00.000Z	histo	MTecknology	they have the option of sending an email invite but youjust need their ip to connect to them with rdesktop
2008-12-01T06:26:00.000Z	histo	MTecknology	they can also right click on my computer and enable remote assistance and you can install rdesktop and connect to them.
2008-12-01T06:27:00.000Z	MTecknology	histo	trying to connect said connection to ip:5900 was closed
2008-12-01T06:27:00.000Z	histo	MTecknology	you have to use rdesktop

2008-12-01T06:36:00.000Z	MTecknology	histo	I'm trying to have him make a user/pass for me.... he's an idiot
2008-12-01T06:37:00.000Z	histo	MTecknology	the other PITA is if he's behind a router he may have to forward what ever port windows is using for that.
