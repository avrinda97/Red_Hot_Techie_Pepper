2008-02-20T03:19:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb		I need some help with Samba. Anyone available?
2008-02-20T03:21:00.000Z	danand	natlinuxnewb	- what are you trying to do?
2008-02-20T03:23:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	danand	 I have 2 HDs. One WinXP, this one Ubuntu7.10. AFAIK I have installed Samba. I have successfully got ubuntu to see the WinXP HD, but have not had any luck getting WINxp to see the Ubuntu shares.
2008-02-20T03:25:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	danand	fyi I got ubuntu to see the Win HD by using the ntfs plugin (i think thats what it was)
2008-02-20T03:28:00.000Z	danand	natlinuxnewb	- Samba is an application that allows you to connect to your linux box and view files etc from a windows machine over a network. ie it is a file server. linux can read ntfs (windows) filesystems but not the other way round. you don't need nfs or samba to view files that are located on different disks on the same machine
2008-02-20T03:29:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	danand	How do you mean?
2008-02-20T03:29:00.000Z	danand	natlinuxnewb	- are your windows and linux drives on the same machine?
2008-02-20T03:30:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	danand	yes. How do i get windows to see and acces the ubuntu shared drives?
2008-02-20T03:30:00.000Z	danand	natlinuxnewb	- ok. Not by using samba :). Samba is used so windows machines can access linux boxes over the internet.
2008-02-20T03:31:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	danand	oh. But isnt that what I want as well?
2008-02-20T03:32:00.000Z	danand	natlinuxnewb	- no. unless you have other windows machines that you want to be able to access your gnu/linux box with. ie by r-clicking my computer and "mapping network drive" in windows.
2008-02-20T03:33:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	danand	Well i do and will want that as well, but I cant see my ubuntu HD in windows
2008-02-20T03:34:00.000Z	danand	natlinuxnewb	- ok. Samba is good :). I know what you want is possible - have you google'd??
2008-02-20T03:35:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	danand	 I've been reading https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently but they arent really talking about what I want to do
2008-02-20T03:36:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	danand	 setting up ubuntu to see windows was easy.
2008-02-20T03:37:00.000Z	danand	natlinuxnewb	- wait one .. brb
2008-02-20T03:41:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	danand	I found this: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/7040, https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-users/2007-March/110018.html, https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/17346, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=178845 And although this is useful its still not talking about how to get WinXP to see with read/write access to the ubuntu shares.
2008-02-20T03:43:00.000Z	danand	natlinuxnewb	- your filesystem on ubuntu (if you did a default install) is ext3 file system. you can access this from windows using a tool downloadable at http://www.fs-driver.org/. Take a look at this first though ( http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1126732 ), and read the FAQ on the http://www.fs-driver.org/ page.
2008-02-20T03:48:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	danand	I think that is exactly what i need. Thanks. 5 stars. Ill try it and report back if it works.
2008-02-20T03:50:00.000Z	danand	natlinuxnewb	- cool. :). let us know if it works ok or not! and be sure to read up on it first!
2008-02-20T03:50:00.000Z	natlinuxnewb	danand	willdo
