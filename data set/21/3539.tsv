2009-01-16T12:07:00.000Z	sonoblaise		I'm trying to install GSynaptics to configure my laptop's touch pad...  the thing is that it tells me to turn SHMConfig to TRUE in xorg.conf or in XF86Config...  I found xorg.conf, but I don't know where to put the option...  anyone ould give me a cue?  thanks!
2009-01-16T12:07:00.000Z	nickrud	sonoblaise	in the mouse section
2009-01-16T12:07:00.000Z	nickrud	sonoblaise	doh, in the touchpad section :)
2009-01-16T12:09:00.000Z	sonoblaise	nickrud	 the thing is that my xorg.conf is pretty empty...  I'll go check again to be sure
2009-01-16T12:10:00.000Z	nickrud	sonoblaise	if there's no synaptic touchpad section (I don't have my laptop handy) it's easy to create one
2009-01-16T12:11:00.000Z	sonoblaise	nickrud	 where is xorg.conf supposed to be already.Ã©..  i forgot (sorry!)
2009-01-16T12:11:00.000Z	nickrud	sonoblaise	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-01-16T12:13:00.000Z	sonoblaise	nickrud	thanks... I'm always looking in /usr/...  so now im in it, there is nothing about touchpad or mouse
2009-01-16T12:13:00.000Z	nickrud	sonoblaise	ok, put a copy on http://paste.ubuntu.com
2009-01-16T12:14:00.000Z	sonoblaise	nickrud	http://paste.ubuntu.com/105441/
2009-01-16T12:17:00.000Z	nickrud	sonoblaise	a sec
2009-01-16T12:17:00.000Z	sonoblaise	nickrud	 no prob!  thanks!
2009-01-16T12:24:00.000Z	nickrud	sonoblaise	http://paste.ubuntu.com/105444/ . Got distracted by an admin issue in another channel, sorry. This should do the job
2009-01-16T12:25:00.000Z	sonoblaise	nickrud	 Thanks a lot!  I'm still learning the tircks of linux slowly but surely
2009-01-16T12:26:00.000Z	nickrud	sonoblaise	enjoy. With ubuntu, you should only need to learn as you go. If you lose your mouse (not likely, but I couldn't actually test that xorg.conf) let me kno0w
2009-01-16T12:28:00.000Z	sonoblaise	nickrud	that wont be right now: I'm running low on battery and my AC adapter is at home and downloads ar on the way... but if you can tell me what the device and protocol options represent it would help me really understand :)
2009-01-16T12:30:00.000Z	nickrud	sonoblaise	man xorg.conf goes into some detail
2009-01-16T12:32:00.000Z	sonoblaise	nickrud	ok, i'll read it.. i already redirected the man output to a textfile for later reading
2009-01-16T12:33:00.000Z	nickrud	sonoblaise	all man is doing is formatting files in /usr/share/man
2009-01-16T12:33:00.000Z	nickrud	sonoblaise	another interesting place for docs is /usr/share/doc/<packagename>. Some have more than others, all have the changelogs
2009-01-16T12:34:00.000Z	sonoblaise	nickrud	yeah I knonw, but man xorg.conf > something.txt still works ;)
