2007-05-15T09:45:00.000Z	Jack_Smirnoff		I need to reinstall XP... I have a dual boot setup...  I plan on using the Super Grub Boot CD...  Is there anything I should check or make note of BEFORE I reinstall XP.  Like which partition is swap and which one has Ubuntu...
2007-05-15T09:46:00.000Z	nomin	Jack_Smirnoff	make sure you back up all your data in case something goes wrong.
2007-05-15T09:46:00.000Z	Jack_Smirnoff		Nothing in Ubuntu I can do without..
2007-05-15T09:46:00.000Z	Jack_Smirnoff		I have everything on a shared partition
2007-05-15T09:47:00.000Z	nomin	Jack_Smirnoff	windows might erase your linux bootloader so you might need to use a live cd to chroot into you linux installation to reinstall the bootloader.
2007-05-15T09:48:00.000Z	Jack_Smirnoff		That is why I was going to use the SGR cd..
2007-05-15T09:48:00.000Z	Jack_Smirnoff		I am sure it with change the mbr
2007-05-15T09:49:00.000Z	Jack_Smirnoff		and setting root user is not advised
2007-05-15T09:50:00.000Z	nomin	Jack_Smirnoff	if all you're doing is reinstalling windows then all you'll probably need to worry about is data on the windows partition getting erased and the boot loader.  If you're planning on changing your partitioning scheme things would get more complex.
2007-05-15T09:52:00.000Z	Jack_Smirnoff		nomin..  nuthing on the XP partition I need to woory about... I keep everything on other partitions and drives...  How about a quick refresh on what to use in UB to see my HD0 SD0 etc so I can point grub to the right partition.
2007-05-15T09:52:00.000Z	nomin	Jack_Smirnoff	sudo fdisk -l
2007-05-15T09:53:00.000Z	Jack_Smirnoff		thanks
2007-05-15T09:53:00.000Z	nomin	Jack_Smirnoff	make sure windows doesn't try to format your linux partitions.
2007-05-15T09:53:00.000Z	Jack_Smirnoff	nomin	is that dash EYE or Ell
2007-05-15T09:53:00.000Z	nomin		l and in lamb
2007-05-15T09:54:00.000Z	Jack_Smirnoff		thanks... I am comfortable that I will not overwrite my partition table..
2007-05-15T09:54:00.000Z	nomin	Jack_Smirnoff	the "l" stands for "list" because you want to list your partitions
2007-05-15T09:55:00.000Z	nomin	Jack_Smirnoff	when I reinstalled windows I disabled the bootloader first.  I'm using a different distro with my bootloader though and I don't think you can disable the bootloader with ubuntu.
2007-05-15T09:55:00.000Z	Jack_Smirnoff		Wish me luck... I have a cool XP cd that lets me do an unattended install in 7 minutes...
2007-05-15T09:56:00.000Z	nomin	Jack_Smirnoff	 btw, I can do just about anything on linux now that I can do on windows.
2007-05-15T09:57:00.000Z	Jack_Smirnoff	nomin	agreed, except that I get paid to work in windows...
