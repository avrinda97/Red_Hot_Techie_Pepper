2005-11-25T07:42:00.000Z	Urthm0ver		how do I configure breezy to work with a remote Xserver?  what do I need to change on the host(this ubuntu system)?
2005-11-25T07:44:00.000Z	Urthm0ver		does anyone know how to server Zwindows to a remote system?
2005-11-25T07:44:00.000Z	Urthm0ver		Xwindows
2005-11-25T07:44:00.000Z	Urthm0ver		vnc is too slow
2005-11-25T07:44:00.000Z	Urthm0ver		I guess none of you even really knows enough to help ?
2005-11-25T07:45:00.000Z	rabeldable	Urthm0ver	vnc is fast for me
2005-11-25T07:46:00.000Z	Urthm0ver		over vpn I think compressed ssh would give me better performance
2005-11-25T07:47:00.000Z	Urthm0ver		there is no such thing as sudo apt-get install XDM
2005-11-25T07:47:00.000Z	Urthm0ver		or something similar
2005-11-25T07:47:00.000Z	rabeldable	Urthm0ver	You might have a packet fragmentation problem check you MTU size
2005-11-25T07:47:00.000Z	rabeldable		anyone know how to add factoids to ubotu?
2005-11-25T07:48:00.000Z	Urthm0ver	rabeldable	and where do
2005-11-25T07:48:00.000Z	Urthm0ver		I check that?
2005-11-25T07:48:00.000Z	rabeldable	Urthm0ver	ifconfig -a and look for MTU size
2005-11-25T07:49:00.000Z	Urthm0ver		cause I'm almost positive running the Xserver locally will be guaranteed better performanbce..think about it...less size in the packets...and it's not like a screen capture
2005-11-25T07:49:00.000Z	rabeldable	Urthm0ver	if its 1500 try to lower it in incriments of 20 to find the "sweet spot"
2005-11-25T07:49:00.000Z	Urthm0ver		so back to the original question does anyone in here know what configs I need to change or what services to start in order to connect to the Xserver of the ubuntu installation from a remote system?
2005-11-25T07:50:00.000Z	Urthm0ver		I'll try to do that while I hope that others actually know what I'm talking about
2005-11-25T07:51:00.000Z	rabeldable	Urthm0ver	have you looked at ssh -X for X11 forwarding, and when you get there type startx.
2005-11-25T07:51:00.000Z	rabeldable		you need a Xclient installed on the system your going from.
2005-11-25T07:53:00.000Z	Urthm0ver	rabeldable	 I'm a linux noob.....specifically what config file and where in it do I need to make a switch...then what can I do to test that the ssh service is running and listening properly to forward X11
