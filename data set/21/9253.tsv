2005-11-17T16:28:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mmiikkee12	congrats
2005-11-17T16:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mmiikkee12	older moniter or older video card?
2005-11-17T16:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mmiikkee12	what is the res. set at 1200?
2005-11-17T16:32:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	gnomefreak	didn't work
2005-11-17T16:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mmiikkee12	have you tried to configure your x- setup yet?
2005-11-17T16:33:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	gnomefreak	was i supposed to...?
2005-11-17T16:34:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	gnomefreak	is it really hard to configure? (this is one of the few things i've never done with linux)
2005-11-17T16:35:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mmiikkee12	 not really but i cant remember the command :( i wanna say its gedit x-session/xorg but its been so long
2005-11-17T16:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mmiikkee12	thats where it should be
2005-11-17T16:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mmiikkee12	its gonna be colorfull i think its blue
2005-11-17T16:40:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mmiikkee12	before you get to the moniter part make sure it has the right one
2005-11-17T16:41:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	gnomefreak	or anyone: Use kernel framebuffer device interface?
2005-11-17T16:42:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mmiikkee12	 sure go for it
2005-11-17T16:43:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mmiikkee12	ill be back in a few time for a smoke
2005-11-17T16:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mmiikkee12	add a 3.4 or a 4.0 to the end
2005-11-18T17:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mmiikkee12	 im not sure any linux has to reboot after updates unless its kernel or something like that
2005-11-18T17:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mmiikkee12	 to me nothing about windows is "safe"
2005-11-18T17:46:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mmiikkee12	 you just installed linux dont give up already
2005-11-18T17:48:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mmiikkee12	 with linux you can be tweeking your system for 10 years
