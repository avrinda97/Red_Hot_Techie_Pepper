2006-05-22T13:40:00.000Z	Pimpshizzled	nanotube	do you use ubuntu?
2006-05-22T13:40:00.000Z	nanotube	Pimpshizzled	well,  yea, that's why i am on #ubuntu :)
2006-05-22T13:41:00.000Z	Pimpshizzled	nanotube	lol, im a bit new here, this is my second day using ubuntu, its pretty sweet, windows xp has recently been made my secondry boot because of it
2006-05-22T13:41:00.000Z	Pimpshizzled	nanotube	but tell me, is there anything you could suggest for me to improve gnome visually, anywhere i should have a good look?
2006-05-22T13:41:00.000Z	nanotube	Pimpshizzled	heh nice
2006-05-22T13:41:00.000Z	Pimpshizzled	nanotube	id love a bit of transpareny on here
2006-05-22T13:42:00.000Z	nanotube	Pimpshizzled	well, i like the default gnome look myself ;) but you can look at gnome.org and look at their theme collection
2006-05-22T13:55:00.000Z	Pimpshizzled	nanotube	since your on a roll mate, i got a really daft question for ya, but it has me in circles :P how do i set my mp3 so they automatically open in 'beep' media player?
2006-05-22T13:56:00.000Z	nanotube	Pimpshizzled	right click on an mp3, select "openwith" and find beepmediaplayer in there.
2006-05-22T13:56:00.000Z	nanotube	Pimpshizzled	that to make sure it shows up in the openwith list
2006-05-22T13:56:00.000Z	Pimpshizzled	nanotube	done that a few times, it was the first thing i tried
2006-05-22T13:56:00.000Z	nanotube	Pimpshizzled	then, right click on an mp3, select properties, select the "open with" tab, and check the radio button next to beep
2006-05-22T13:56:00.000Z	Pimpshizzled	nanotube	it shows it 3 times, lol
2006-05-22T13:57:00.000Z	nanotube	Pimpshizzled	and that will make it open in beep automatically upon doubleclick.
2006-05-22T13:57:00.000Z	Pimpshizzled	nanotube	i might just uninstall totem, its doing my brain in, lol
2006-05-22T13:57:00.000Z	nanotube	Pimpshizzled	haha 3 times eh. well that should make it easy to find in the "openwith" list in properties.
2006-05-22T13:58:00.000Z	nanotube	Pimpshizzled	to make totem more useful, do "sudo apt-get install totem-xine". that installs another backend for totem, that is able to play a lot more stuff. still not as good as mplayer, but decent. :)
