2010-06-10T08:34:00.000Z	mib_mib_		can someone help ssh into my server? i'm locked out for some reason... it was working a few weeks ago.
2010-06-10T08:34:00.000Z	mib_mib_		i can login through the web console to administer it
2010-06-10T08:35:00.000Z	Docteh	mib_mib_	what kind of problem, times out, connection refused or it just doesn't like your password?
2010-06-10T08:36:00.000Z	mib_mib_	Docteh	it just times out, doesn't even say anything back to me
2010-06-10T08:36:00.000Z	Docteh	mib_mib_	are you sshing to right hostname, also check firewall/port forwards
2010-06-10T08:36:00.000Z	Docteh	mib_mib_	is a web console a command line?
2010-06-10T08:37:00.000Z	mib_mib_	Docteh	yeah, i added the port to my local router to allow the proper ssh port. I can ssh on a different port to a different server fine. I turned the firewall off on the server
2010-06-10T08:39:00.000Z	Docteh	mib_mib_	is the server in question on a home internet connection? my isp blocks incoming to port 22
2010-06-10T08:39:00.000Z	mib_mib_	Docteh	nah its slicehost
2010-06-10T08:40:00.000Z	mib_mib_	Docteh	on my belkin router it asks for inbound port, private ip address and private port -- the open port on my server is 8787, does this mean i put 8787 in both inbound port and private port?
2010-06-10T08:40:00.000Z	mib_mib_	Docteh	or do i use 22 on private port and 8787 on inbound port?
2010-06-10T08:41:00.000Z	Docteh	mib_mib_	if you cant ssh in to your slice, and you can get on IRC from behind your router, probably dont have to worry about the router
2010-06-10T08:43:00.000Z	mib_mib_	Docteh	okay, when i use the -vv option for ssh it says connection refused
2010-06-10T08:43:00.000Z	Docteh	mib_mib_	do netstat -ntpl on the slice and see what port sshd is listening on
2010-06-10T08:45:00.000Z	mib_mib_	Docteh	yeah its listening on the same port i'm trying to ssh into
2010-06-10T08:58:00.000Z	mib_mib_	Docteh	here is my sshd conf file http://pastebin.com/MEPvCfGi
2010-06-10T09:00:00.000Z	Docteh	mib_mib_	try to ssh to the box from the box like: ssh 209.2.3.3 -p 8787
2010-06-10T09:00:00.000Z	mib_mib_	Docteh	yep thats what i'm doing
2010-06-10T09:02:00.000Z	mib_mib_	Docteh	okay so try to ssh to the box from the box
2010-06-10T09:02:00.000Z	mib_mib_	Docteh	let me try that
2010-06-10T09:05:00.000Z	mib_mib_	Docteh	okay, so it worked fine, sshing from the remote box to itself using both 127.0.0.1 and its own ip address
