2006-02-26T09:44:00.000Z	_jason	shortjollio	you shouldn't need to write to /usr, but if you really believe you do, use sudo
2006-02-26T09:44:00.000Z	shortjollio	_jason	i know about sudo but is there a way to do it without going into th terminal
2006-02-26T09:45:00.000Z	_jason	shortjollio	what are you trying to do exactly?
2006-02-26T09:45:00.000Z	shortjollio	_jason	i downloaded some new brushes for gimp and id like to put them in the brush folder
2006-02-26T09:46:00.000Z	_jason	shortjollio	put them in ~/.gimp-2.2/brushes/
2006-02-26T09:46:00.000Z	shortjollio	_jason	how?
2006-02-26T09:46:00.000Z	_jason	shortjollio	open nautilus and navigate to .gimp-2.2/brushes in your $HOME, then copy and paste
2006-02-26T09:47:00.000Z	_jason	shortjollio	you'll need to show hidden folders (press ctrl+h)
2006-02-26T09:48:00.000Z	shortjollio	_jason	ok thx, that works
2006-02-26T09:51:00.000Z	shortjollio	_jason	i dont see the new brushes tho when i use gimp
2006-02-26T09:51:00.000Z	_jason	shortjollio	did you close gimp and start it up again
