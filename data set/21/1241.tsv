2012-04-27T21:57:00.000Z	pratz		hey guys I have ubuntu 10.04 and would like to upgrade to 12.04, how ??
2012-04-27T21:58:00.000Z	Monotoko	pratz	"do-release-upgrade"
2012-04-27T21:58:00.000Z	pratz	Monotoko	but i guess before that I have to update my current 10.04 , correct ?
2012-04-27T21:59:00.000Z	Monotoko	pratz	yeah.. make sure you're up to date, then use "do-release-upgrade" - you may want to wait as the servers are still being overloaded
2012-04-27T22:00:00.000Z	pratz	Monotoko	but the main concern is, I am using screen terminal emulator, and will it work with unity ??
2012-04-27T22:01:00.000Z	Monotoko	pratz	are you using the server version or the desktop version..?
2012-04-27T22:01:00.000Z	pratz	Monotoko	desktop version
2012-04-27T22:02:00.000Z	Monotoko	pratz	it will update you to unity... however, you're probably better doing a fresh install... upgrades are still a rough ride
2012-04-27T22:02:00.000Z	pratz	Monotoko	I am a programmer and I normally prefer, screen, yeahconsole and vim , vim will surely work but I am not sure of the other two
2012-04-27T22:02:00.000Z	Monotoko	pratz	they'll all work fine in 12.04
2012-04-27T22:02:00.000Z	Monotoko	pratz	if anything is going to go wrong, it'll be your GUI
2012-04-27T22:02:00.000Z	pratz	Monotoko	a fresh install will not be possible for me as I have lot of data now
2012-04-27T22:03:00.000Z	Monotoko	pratz	then my advice would be to not upgrade until you've taken a backup
2012-04-27T22:03:00.000Z	pratz	Monotoko	so, if we consider the worst condition, how can I gain back my GUI ??
2012-04-27T22:04:00.000Z	Monotoko	pratz	with a reinstall... however it is possible that it might all die so I would backup just in case.... nmittal, sorry... can you post the contents of "sudo fdisk -l" into pastebin?
2012-04-27T22:04:00.000Z	pratz	Monotoko	but I have data which is more than 600GB and it is not possible for me to find a spare hard disk
2012-04-27T22:04:00.000Z	Monotoko	pratz	then I repeat, don't attempt an upgrade
2012-04-27T22:05:00.000Z	pratz	Monotoko	so, how do I get ubuntu 12.04 ??
2012-04-27T22:06:00.000Z	pratz	Monotoko	there should be a way
2012-04-27T22:06:00.000Z	Monotoko	pratz	the way is to backup... always have a backup, it's foolish not to
2012-04-27T22:07:00.000Z	Monotoko	pratz	nothing in the world recommends you upgrade without a backup
