2008-05-14T07:48:00.000Z	Baatti		someone please help me, I'm really upset...  I just downloaded and burned the Ubuntu 8.04 .ISO...I'm trying to install it inside windows...it goes through the checksums and then starts creating an image, it gets to about 711MB out of 733MB or something, then it stops and says "Cannot access CD, it may be being used by another program."  Which as far as I know, it ain't!  Any ideas?
2008-05-14T07:49:00.000Z	Baatti		also, I can't get it to load as a live CD...it get's to about 3% of the kernel, then it says, Cannot access Boot disc
2008-05-14T07:50:00.000Z	soldats	Baatti	you should burn at the lowest speed
2008-05-14T07:50:00.000Z	Baatti		ok, I'll try that
2008-05-14T07:51:00.000Z	soldats	Baatti	also i think you meant the cd wouldnt boot but you can check it by running as a livecd and click the check cd for errors button
2008-05-14T07:51:00.000Z	Baatti		ok, let me try reburning it at a slower speed, then I'll check for errors at reboot
2008-05-14T07:51:00.000Z	Baatti		thanks guys
2008-05-14T07:51:00.000Z	Baatti		I'll probably be back soon
2008-05-14T07:51:00.000Z	Baatti		peace
2008-05-14T07:51:00.000Z	soldats	Baatti	good luck
2008-05-14T07:51:00.000Z	Baatti		thanks
2008-05-14T07:54:00.000Z	Baatti		hey again..another question...which write method should I use? Session-At-Once?
2008-05-14T07:55:00.000Z	soldats	Baatti	write the cd as a RAW/DAO and at the lowest speed as a single session i believe
2008-05-14T07:56:00.000Z	Baatti		I have the following options: SAO, TAO, TAO with no pregap, raw96r and raw16
2008-05-14T07:58:00.000Z	Baatti	soldats	 I have the following options: SAO, TAO, TAO with no pregap, raw96r and raw16
2008-05-14T07:59:00.000Z	soldats	Baatti	i think you need the raw16 most likely not to sure though. what app are you using

2008-05-14T08:00:00.000Z	soldats	Baatti	1 sec
2008-05-14T08:00:00.000Z	Baatti		kk
2008-05-14T08:01:00.000Z	soldats	Baatti	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto this should have the correct method. it sounded like you did it fine but this gives you examples to check it for errors
2008-05-14T08:02:00.000Z	Baatti	soldats	thanks
