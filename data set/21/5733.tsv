2007-09-27T13:23:00.000Z	marko-_-	LjL	well i went to Programs and then add-remove and it suddenly freezed
2007-09-27T13:23:00.000Z	LjL	marko-_-	ah, then not apt-get
2007-09-27T13:23:00.000Z	LjL	marko-_-	it's "Add/Remove Programs"
2007-09-27T13:23:00.000Z	marko-_-	LjL	well it has all the programs like apt-get right ?;D
2007-09-27T13:23:00.000Z	LjL	marko-_-	the backend is still APT (the Debian/Ubuntu package manager), but APT is a different thing from apt-get
2007-09-27T13:24:00.000Z	marko-_-	LjL	ok thanks
2007-09-27T13:24:00.000Z	LjL	marko-_-	have you tried just clicking on the Close button of the window and waiting a while?
2007-09-27T13:25:00.000Z	LjL	marko-_-	then hit Alt+F2 and type "xkill". you'll see a crosshair instead of the normal mouse button. click inside that winow.
2007-09-27T13:25:00.000Z	LjL	marko-_-	i meant, instead of the normal mouse *cursor*
2007-12-20T02:14:00.000Z	LjL	marko-_-	first thing is, try from a live CD « sudo mount /dev/whatever /some/temporary/directory » where /dev/whatever is the Windows partition
2007-12-20T02:17:00.000Z	marko-_-	LjL	thanks
2009-05-27T19:14:00.000Z	LjL	marko-_-	what channel are you after?
2009-05-27T19:15:00.000Z	marko-_-	LjL	thank you
2009-05-27T19:21:00.000Z	LjL	marko-_-	maybe. is this ontopic for here though?
