2005-01-01T13:01:00.000Z	jdub	anir	now you're starting to define the issue :)
2005-01-01T13:02:00.000Z	jdub	anir	the problem here is that, for various reasons, FOSS is locked out of a lot of multimedia formats and protocols
2005-01-01T13:02:00.000Z	jdub	anir	so in large part, we cannot use these things easily on linux
2005-01-01T13:03:00.000Z	jdub	anir	for the more technically minded, there are ways around this, but it involves downloading software because none of it can be shipped with Ubuntu itself for legal reasons
2005-01-01T13:04:00.000Z	jdub	anir	are you using warty or hoary?
2005-01-01T13:04:00.000Z	anir	jdub	i am using warty
2005-01-01T13:04:00.000Z	jdub	anir	ok, so those are the initial security updates available for warty
2005-01-01T13:06:00.000Z	jdub	anir	you get all the required software from the CD only with ubuntu too, but you have additional needs
2005-01-01T13:08:00.000Z	jdub	anir	that's ok :)
2005-01-01T13:10:00.000Z	jdub	anir	enoug thanks.
2005-01-01T13:14:00.000Z	jdub	anir	there is no need to continue this discussion.
2005-01-01T13:14:00.000Z	jdub	anir	we're listening, just keep it on-topic please.
2005-01-01T13:19:00.000Z	anir	jdub	i beg an apology
2005-01-01T13:21:00.000Z	jdub	anir	so there are programs around that will help you run windows software on linux (generally not games), but these are for special cases. in general, there's no point switching to linux while continuing to use windows software.
2005-01-01T13:23:00.000Z	jdub	anir	people work on what's important to them.
