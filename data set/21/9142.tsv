2005-11-02T14:27:00.000Z	joeb		anybody ever tried to get a creative zen nano plus working with ubuntu?
2005-11-02T14:28:00.000Z	targetx	joeb	nope, but I think it just works as a regular USB Mass Storage Device
2005-11-02T14:29:00.000Z	joeb	targetx	i thought so too
2005-11-02T14:29:00.000Z	joeb	targetx	but it just locks everything up
2005-11-02T14:29:00.000Z	targetx	joeb	ooh... maybe dmesg output or /var/log/messages* can assist you in tracing down what the problem is ?
2005-11-02T14:30:00.000Z	joeb	targetx	you get the message of a new usb devices in /var/log/messages but if you try to cat /proc/bus/usb/devices
2005-11-02T14:30:00.000Z	joeb	targetx	it locks until you remove the zen
2005-11-02T14:30:00.000Z	targetx	joeb	rephrase that sentence please. it doesn't make sence
2005-11-02T14:30:00.000Z	targetx	joeb	ok I get it now after your sec comment
2005-11-02T14:31:00.000Z	joeb	targetx	:) sorry habit of typing in a less crowded channel
2005-11-02T14:31:00.000Z	targetx	joeb	no problem!
2005-11-02T14:32:00.000Z	targetx	joeb	I suggest googling for it.. something like 'using zen on linux' for example.. I think that, if there is a fix, google knows it
2005-11-02T14:32:00.000Z	joeb	targetx	in windows, it does indeed come up as a mass storage thing, but in linux it come up and nothing, i have tried gnomad2 and that just hangs, I have tried a standard pen drive to make sure Im not going mad and that works
2005-11-02T14:32:00.000Z	joeb	targetx	looks like im hosed then, have been googling for about an hour :(
2005-11-02T14:33:00.000Z	joeb	targetx	right im off to the pub sod this ;)
2005-11-02T14:33:00.000Z	targetx	joeb	ahh crap.. I'm suspecting that it is something in the kernel that is not responding to some querry made by the zen
2005-11-02T14:33:00.000Z	targetx	joeb	maybe you can try upgrading your kernel .. which kernel are you using ?
2005-11-02T14:34:00.000Z	joeb	targetx	well i have a week off work, how hard can it been to write a device driver? (2.6.12-8-386 ooh not 12-9 will have to check that)!
2005-11-02T14:34:00.000Z	joeb	targetx	cheers for you help, i really am off now
2005-11-02T14:34:00.000Z	targetx	joeb	goodbye!
2005-11-02T14:34:00.000Z	targetx	joeb	(perhaps try 686 kernel :P)
