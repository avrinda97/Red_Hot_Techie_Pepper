2006-01-13T10:41:00.000Z	hyakuhei		take esd out of the gnome startup process and try again
2006-01-13T10:41:00.000Z	boxy	hyakuhei	im listening to Lynyrd Skynyrd on Rythembox
2006-01-13T10:41:00.000Z	hyakuhei	boxy	doesnt matter
2006-01-13T10:41:00.000Z	boxy		So it's safe to assume my sound isn't broken?
2006-01-13T10:41:00.000Z	hyakuhei	boxy	no
2006-01-13T10:42:00.000Z	boxy	hyakuhei	so what should i try? or do you have a link?
2006-01-13T10:42:00.000Z	hyakuhei	boxy	sound could be coming through esd / artsd (kde) / alsa / oss(emulation)
2006-01-13T10:42:00.000Z	hyakuhei	boxy	when its taking ages to boot, drop to another terminal, run top and see whats going on
2006-01-13T10:42:00.000Z	hyakuhei		or pstree gdm
2006-01-13T10:43:00.000Z	boxy	hyakuhei	esd is running in top is that good?
2006-01-13T10:43:00.000Z	hyakuhei	boxy	wont hurt anything if you kill it, see if your boot speeds up when you do
2006-01-13T10:44:00.000Z	boxy	hyakuhei	okay thanks is there anything else i can try while im at it?
2006-01-13T10:44:00.000Z	hyakuhei	boxy	dont know really, just watch top, see if anything is maxing out
2006-01-13T10:44:00.000Z	boxy	hyakuhei	i figure i might as well try a few things since it takes like 8 minutes to load
2006-01-13T10:44:00.000Z	boxy		aight thanks
2006-01-13T10:44:00.000Z	boxy		btw how do i set my domain name?
2006-01-13T10:44:00.000Z	boxy		and is there really anything it should be set to?
2006-01-13T10:45:00.000Z	boxy	hyakuhei	would setting my domain name on this computer help, if so how do i set it?
2006-01-13T10:46:00.000Z	hyakuhei	boxy	nope, shouldnt effect the load time of gnome at all
