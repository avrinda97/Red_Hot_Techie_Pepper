2008-12-19T13:55:00.000Z	darkrubicant		Windows was installed, I've completely formatted it, but the MBR seems to be persistent.
2008-12-19T13:56:00.000Z	darkrubicant		for instance, the grub loader on this hard-drive recognizes that that hard-drive still has a MBR that contains windows xp and ubuntu
2008-12-19T13:57:00.000Z	darkrubicant		even though I've inserted a new MBR for windows with Ms-sys and I've attempted to wipe that drive
2008-12-19T13:57:00.000Z	darkrubicant		It's a western digital 250 gig sata drive, I suppose I have a few questions
2008-12-19T13:57:00.000Z	darkrubicant		could it have MBR protection?
2008-12-19T13:57:00.000Z	darkrubicant		yes
2008-12-19T13:57:00.000Z	darkrubicant		I want to wipe the darn thing completely
2008-12-19T13:58:00.000Z	darkrubicant		yes I have
2008-12-19T13:58:00.000Z	darkrubicant		I've formatted in ext2 and 3, fat32, and ntfs
2008-12-19T13:58:00.000Z	darkrubicant		Same error everytime I try and the MBR persists.
2008-12-19T13:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	darkrubicant	if you want it clean you can use a disk scrubber
2008-12-19T13:58:00.000Z	darkrubicant	ActionParsnip1	such as?
2008-12-19T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	darkrubicant	there are some on the ultimate boot cd, it alternates bits 5 times per bit to make sure its REALLY hard to recover
2008-12-19T14:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	darkrubicant	dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda (for example replace hda with the name of the drive (not partition))
2008-12-19T14:01:00.000Z	darkrubicant	ActionParsnip1	where can I get my hands on the ultimate boot cd, if possible I can also scrub the hard-drive from the operating system i'm on right now, this system has two hard-drives in it, and the hard-drive i'm currently on has Ubuntu, whereas the other drive had ubuntu and windows xp and now i'm simply trying to get windows xp reinstalled on it.
2008-12-19T14:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	darkrubicant	www.ultimatebootcd.com
2008-12-19T14:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	darkrubicant	its free and awesome
2008-12-19T14:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	darkrubicant	its also got a TONNE of other tools too
2008-12-19T14:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	darkrubicant	like drive testing apps from the major hdd manufacturers
2008-12-19T14:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	darkrubicant	all good stuff, everyone should have a copy
2008-12-19T14:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	darkrubicant	its pretty decent, just needs some extra config some times. check appdb for compatibility
