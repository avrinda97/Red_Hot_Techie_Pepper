2012-09-03T20:27:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		This is weird.
2012-09-03T20:27:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		My windows 7 installation
2012-09-03T20:27:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		or rather, any another partition on my hard drive isn't being detected
2012-09-03T20:27:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		and instead is showing unallocated space
2012-09-03T20:27:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		What could be causing this?
2012-09-03T20:28:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		I'm trying to install Windows 7 and Ubuntu ( actually, Xubuntu) side by side
2012-09-03T20:28:00.000Z	yeats	Foxhoundz	does 'sudo fdisk -l' show the windows partition?
2012-09-03T20:28:00.000Z	Foxhoundz	yeats	is that a question?
2012-09-03T20:29:00.000Z	yeats	Foxhoundz	yes, as indicated by the "?" at the end of it
2012-09-03T20:29:00.000Z	Foxhoundz	yeats	it's showing two ntfs partitions on sda1 and sda2
2012-09-03T20:29:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		so it does indeed detect it
2012-09-03T20:30:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		but gparted shows 100% free unallocated space
2012-09-03T20:30:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		so does the Xubuntu installer
2012-09-03T20:30:00.000Z	yeats	Foxhoundz	can you paste a screenshot of what you're seeing on gparted?
2012-09-03T20:30:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		okay
2012-09-03T20:33:00.000Z	Foxhoundz	yeats	well....I can't show you the screenshot at the moment
2012-09-03T20:33:00.000Z	yeats	Foxhoundz	ok
2012-09-03T20:33:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		network card is not being detected
2012-09-03T20:33:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		and I'm having trouble mounting my USB flash drive
2012-09-03T20:34:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		but those are problems for another day. I just wish I could figure out what's causing it to be not detected
2012-09-03T20:35:00.000Z	yeats	Foxhoundz	seen this (and other forums threads)?: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1510017
