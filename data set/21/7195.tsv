2008-11-12T21:05:00.000Z	dromer	daan	ubuntu has that tendency yes -_-
2008-11-12T21:11:00.000Z	daan	dromer	what's the problem?
2008-11-12T21:12:00.000Z	dromer	daan	it seems to get loaded just fine (if I can believe Xorg.0.log) but I only get a blank screen and my monitor goes to standby
2008-11-12T21:14:00.000Z	daan	dromer	you don't even get the low graphics option ?
2008-11-12T21:15:00.000Z	dromer	daan	I don't get anything
2008-11-12T21:16:00.000Z	daan	dromer	can you run a failsafe Gnome session? or don't you know how to do it?
2008-11-12T21:17:00.000Z	dromer	daan	running Kubuntu 8.10
2008-11-12T21:17:00.000Z	daan	dromer	ahh
2008-11-12T21:18:00.000Z	daan	dromer	umm, well in ubuntu, at the login screen there's a button with "Options" on it, and then you can select a session type.. But I don't know how to do it on KDE.. hang on and I'll consolidate the google :)
2008-11-12T21:18:00.000Z	dromer	daan	how can I get a login-screen is X doesn't work, silly :P
2008-11-12T21:19:00.000Z	daan	dromer	wow.. I thought it went black when logging in xD
2008-11-12T21:19:00.000Z	daan	dromer	that's pretty nasty
2008-11-12T21:20:00.000Z	daan	dromer	are you running kubuntu 8.10?
2008-11-12T21:20:00.000Z	dromer	daan	yes, I just said that
2008-11-12T21:21:00.000Z	daan	dromer	ohh missed that one, sorry.. the new X version does seem to cause a lot of problems.. you could try downgrading to 8.04 and wait for a possible fix
2008-11-12T21:22:00.000Z	daan	dromer	that's the best I can help you.. I don't really think there's an easy fix for it
2008-11-12T21:22:00.000Z	daan	dromer	or you could try reinstalling it
2008-11-12T21:23:00.000Z	daan	dromer	I'll do some googling on it, see if there's any fix or possible explanation
2008-11-12T21:24:00.000Z	daan	dromer	seems to be a common problem
2008-11-12T21:25:00.000Z	daan	dromer	somebody gets it to work by pressing ctrl + alt + backspace when the screen goes blank.. ctrl + alt + F1 and then Ctrl + Alt + F7 seems to work aswell
2008-11-12T21:25:00.000Z	daan	dromer	after that reinstalling the graphics driver seems to fix it.. at least temporarily
