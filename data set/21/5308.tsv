2009-08-15T23:48:00.000Z	n2diy	diddy	let me take a look.
2009-08-15T23:52:00.000Z	n2diy	diddy	I see a nvidia  G7600?
2009-08-15T23:52:00.000Z	diddy	n2diy	that is my video card.
2009-08-15T23:52:00.000Z	diddy		I have a pinnacle tv card in there also. Just installed it.
2009-08-15T23:52:00.000Z	diddy		n2I have a pinnacle tv card in there also. Just installed it.
2009-08-15T23:53:00.000Z	diddy	n2diy	I have a pinnacle tv card in there also. Just installed it.
2009-08-15T23:53:00.000Z	n2diy	diddy	do you have a make and model for the pinnacle?
2009-08-15T23:54:00.000Z	diddy	n2diy	unfortunately not. I thought I could find it out via some command. I didn't use the TV card for a long time and threw the box away. I don't recall what model it is.
2009-08-15T23:56:00.000Z	n2diy	diddy	ok, I didn't see anything about pinnacle, but it could be listed by make and model? You can get that off the card from the FCC ID#, and google.
2009-08-15T23:56:00.000Z	diddy	n2diy	I will have a look. Thx for your help.

2009-08-16T00:01:00.000Z	diddy	n2diy	there is no such thing on the card. There is only a sticker with a barcode some long number just underneath it Pinnacle systems GmbH and some other long number followed by (h)
2009-08-16T00:03:00.000Z	diddy	n2diy	I have a /dev/video0 so that means that it was recognized, right?
2009-08-16T00:04:00.000Z	diddy	n2diy	at least that is what it says in the wiki I am just looking at.
2009-08-16T00:05:00.000Z	diddy		What program can I use to record TV with my TV card?
2009-08-16T00:05:00.000Z	diddy		xawtv ?
2009-08-16T00:13:00.000Z	diddy	n2diy	I have a picture it works! xawtv works! *happy* But I don't have a sound. :(
