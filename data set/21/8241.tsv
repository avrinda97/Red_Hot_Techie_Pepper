2010-09-12T21:14:00.000Z	ericblair		why when i've upgraded to a relatively same model dell inspiron (1525 to 15r) am i having problems with touchpad (no toucpad tab in mouse preferences to disable the touchped 'tap to click' functionality) --is there none on the later model?  it renders the machine unuseable - dell laptop ubuntu 10.04
2010-09-12T21:15:00.000Z	ericblair		it doesn't run ubuntu dell inspiron latest cheapo laptop
2010-09-12T21:15:00.000Z	ericblair		because of that
2010-09-12T21:15:00.000Z	ericblair		hell forget it i'm going to have to move to fedora this is ridiculous
2010-09-12T21:16:00.000Z	ericblair		this is a conspiracy between dell and ubuntu people rendering ubuntu unuseable on latest dell laptops this is ridiculous
2010-09-12T21:16:00.000Z	ericblair		this is why dell has withdrawn ubuntu in europe
