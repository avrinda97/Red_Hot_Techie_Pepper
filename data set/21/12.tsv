2004-10-27T06:17:00.000Z	rublind		Excellent
2004-10-27T06:18:00.000Z	rublind		Is there a maximum of how many free cd's you can get?
2004-10-27T06:19:00.000Z	rublind		52.5 MB seems a bit small >_<
2004-10-27T06:19:00.000Z	rublind		I ordered more than 20 cd's, I ordered 200 something. ^_^
2004-10-27T06:19:00.000Z	rublind		I'm going to be handing them out like crazy.
2004-10-27T06:19:00.000Z	rublind		Try it.
2004-10-27T06:20:00.000Z	rublind		What, too many?
2004-10-27T06:20:00.000Z	rublind		What is ubuntu ?
2004-10-27T06:21:00.000Z	rublind		What does it mean.
2004-10-27T06:21:00.000Z	rublind		In what language?
2004-10-27T06:21:00.000Z	jdub	rublind	'be excellent to each other'
2004-10-27T06:34:00.000Z	jdub	rublind	before installing anything manually, check that it's available in ubuntu (including universe)
2004-10-27T06:34:00.000Z	jdub	rublind	if it's definitely not there, i'd recommend using gnu stow (which works with /usr/local)
2004-10-27T06:35:00.000Z	jdub	rublind	with gnu stow, you install to /usr/local/stow/<package> and it manages symlinks back to /usr/local for you
2004-10-27T06:35:00.000Z	jdub	rublind	what do you need to install manually?
2004-10-27T06:36:00.000Z	jdub	rublind	apt-cache show stow
2004-10-27T06:36:00.000Z	rublind	jdub	I'm not on ubuntu yet, I'm just curious
2004-10-27T06:36:00.000Z	jdub	rublind	that's how i'd recommend handling it on any distro. but you shouldn't need to build stuff on ubuntu.
2004-10-27T06:37:00.000Z	rublind	jdub	I would if there are no RPMS for it...
2004-10-27T06:38:00.000Z	jdub	rublind	ubuntu is based on debian (so uses deb, not rpm), and includes most of what's packaged in debian as unsupported packages. ie., most of the free software world. ;)
2004-10-27T14:24:00.000Z	jdub	rublind	apt-get install build-essential
