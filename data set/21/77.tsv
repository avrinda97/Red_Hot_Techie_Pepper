2012-10-19T06:15:00.000Z	bkfitz		Question: Does anyone know how to change the purple boot splash screen/background?  I've tried ubuntu tweak (which successfully changed the 'login' background, but not the boot splash screen), and I've also tried installing a new Plymouth theme (solar) which successfully changed the screen that comes up when I shutdown, but still doesn't change the initial boot screen purple.
2012-10-19T06:15:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	bkfitz	you could replace the image file directly...
2012-10-19T06:16:00.000Z	bkfitz	DaemonicApathy	I think I tried that as well... how would you do that
2012-10-19T06:16:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	bkfitz	Hold on, I'll find the path for you.
2012-10-19T06:20:00.000Z	bkfitz	DaemonicApathy	going to reboot to try something... be back in 3
2012-10-19T06:22:00.000Z	bkfitz	DaemonicApathy	back... love how fast :)
2012-10-19T06:23:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	bkfitz	SSD is always amazing. :-) I can't seem to remember where the purple background is, though...
2012-10-19T06:23:00.000Z	bkfitz	DaemonicApathy	yeah... SSD on a shweeet new lenovo x1 carbon
2012-10-19T06:25:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	bkfitz	No. GRUB is just a boot manager, not the settings on your OS.
2012-10-19T06:26:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	bkfitz	Unless that was the screen you were trying to change?
2012-10-19T06:46:00.000Z	bkfitz	DaemonicApathy	well.... when I boot up, I first see a black screen with lenovo etc, then a purple blank one, then a purple one with ubuntu text, then login screen.  I want to change two purple ones
2012-10-19T06:46:00.000Z	bkfitz	DaemonicApathy	I've successfully changed the login screen with ubuntu tweak
2012-10-19T06:47:00.000Z	bkfitz	DaemonicApathy	I'm not really sure what "Plymouth" is, but I've read a lot about that
2012-10-19T06:47:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	bkfitz	drop any image you like into /boot/grub/, and that should change the grub screen too.
2012-10-19T06:48:00.000Z	bkfitz	DaemonicApathy	tried that and it didn't work
2012-10-19T06:49:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	bkfitz	a few other options: http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/10/grub-splash-image/
2012-10-19T06:50:00.000Z	bkfitz	DaemonicApathy	I'm not dual booted, so I don't really care about grub actually... I think boot skips right past it and goes straight to Ubuntu (correct me if I'm wrong)
2012-10-19T06:53:00.000Z	bkfitz	DaemonicApathy	tried this as well: sudo update-alternatives --config default.plymouth
2012-10-19T06:54:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	bkfitz	Well, I'm a lot more useful with grub than with the boot splash, unfortunately. I do wish you luck.
2012-10-19T06:57:00.000Z	bkfitz	DaemonicApathy	found solution on that page: sudo update-initramfs -k all -u
2012-10-19T06:58:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	bkfitz	Awesome. Good on ya. ^_^
