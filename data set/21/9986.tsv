2005-06-02T09:13:00.000Z	crimsun	raz	what happens when you use mplayer -ao esd foo ?
2005-06-02T09:22:00.000Z	raz	crimsun	here's what i get for "mplayer -ao esd foo" in a terminal:
2005-06-02T09:22:00.000Z	crimsun	raz	that's not the error. Use pastebin.com for the real flood.
2005-06-02T09:31:00.000Z	raz	crimsun	http://pastebin.com/289889
2005-06-02T09:32:00.000Z	crimsun	raz	"foo" is a placeholder. Substitute a real filename.
2005-06-02T09:33:00.000Z	raz	crimsun	do i have to give the full path and the extension of the file?
2005-06-02T09:34:00.000Z	crimsun	raz	no, but the path must be valid
2005-06-02T09:34:00.000Z	raz	crimsun	ok, its running.. says Starting playback, runs.. no sound tho.
2005-06-02T09:34:00.000Z	crimsun	raz	amixer output to pastebin
2005-06-02T09:35:00.000Z	raz	crimsun	roger that
2005-06-02T09:35:00.000Z	raz	crimsun	 uhm, wait, what do you mean by 'amixer output'? copy/paste to pastebin?
2005-06-02T09:42:00.000Z	raz	crimsun	 stopped it w/ ctrl+c after a couple of secs.. but here: http://pastebin.com/289899
2005-06-02T09:43:00.000Z	crimsun	raz	ok, so mplayer works with esd.
2005-06-02T09:43:00.000Z	crimsun	raz	do you hear anything?
2005-06-02T09:44:00.000Z	raz	crimsun	nope, nothing.
2005-06-02T09:44:00.000Z	crimsun	raz	did you paste your amixer output?
2005-06-02T09:46:00.000Z	raz	crimsun	never mind my stupidity, it does run from the Terminal with that cmd. I'll try w/o the Terminal.
2005-06-02T09:46:00.000Z	crimsun	raz	but can you hear anything?
2005-06-02T09:47:00.000Z	raz	crimsun	yes, absolutely.
2005-06-02T09:47:00.000Z	crimsun	raz	ok, so it does work? ok.
2005-06-02T09:48:00.000Z	raz	crimsun	on a totally unrelated topic.. is there a way to disable the little animation ubuntu performs when you minimize windows?
