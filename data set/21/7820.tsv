2006-07-09T13:49:00.000Z	sharms		!tell zgat about wireless
2006-07-09T13:49:00.000Z	zgat	sharms	i have read all that and tried it, still cant get it to werk...
2006-07-09T13:49:00.000Z	sharms	zgat	is it an encrypted connection?
2006-07-09T13:50:00.000Z	sharms	zgat	does the router act as a dhcp server, have mac address protection disabled, and your client set to obtain address automatically?
2006-07-09T13:51:00.000Z	zgat	sharms	yes it is, i cant even connect to the router from this pc....wlan0 has no signal
2006-07-09T13:51:00.000Z	sharms	zgat	move the router closer and try again
2006-07-09T13:52:00.000Z	zgat	sharms	the router is 2 feet away already
2006-07-09T13:52:00.000Z	sharms	zgat	is it broadcasting its ssid?
2006-07-09T13:53:00.000Z	zgat	sharms	yes, i have a windows machine connected wirelessy as we speak
2006-07-09T13:53:00.000Z	sharms	zgat	and where do you get the impression there isn't a signal in linux? what application tells you this?
2006-07-09T13:54:00.000Z	zgat	sharms	i added network monitor to my panel, and there it sez no signal
2006-07-09T13:54:00.000Z	sharms	zgat	I am going to say it is near 100% chance you just misconfigured it
2006-07-09T13:55:00.000Z	sharms	zgat	I can't be there to help you through this, but I would give the advise of try out network-manager
2006-07-09T13:55:00.000Z	sharms	zgat	it is a little more automated
2006-07-09T13:55:00.000Z	zgat	sharms	how do i go about checking and correcting???
2006-07-09T13:56:00.000Z	sharms	zgat	either keep asking here about your configuration and have someone else help you, or else try network-manager
2006-07-09T13:57:00.000Z	sharms	zgat	I thought this was a wireless network issue, not a graphics card issue.
2006-07-09T13:58:00.000Z	sharms	zgat	I don't see how ATI fits into your network problems.
2006-07-09T14:02:00.000Z	sharms	zgat	disable the network interface in the ubuntu config
2006-07-09T14:02:00.000Z	sharms	zgat	network-manager won't use it if ubuntu is using it
