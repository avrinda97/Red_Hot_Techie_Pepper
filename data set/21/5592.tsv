2010-01-31T11:14:00.000Z	candy		pen drive is not being detected in my ubuntu 9.10.... what to do??
2010-01-31T11:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy	I saw some of your stuff before, why can't you install from CD?
2010-01-31T11:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy	ok I don't know, and good luck
2010-02-10T23:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy	With enough RAM and such you can virtual machine Windows for the program, also the program might work under Wine.
2010-02-10T23:08:00.000Z	candy	sebsebseb	isnt there any alternate software like coral draw in ubuntu??
2010-02-10T23:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy	Well there are alternative graphics programs, The GIMP, Inkscape etc, however they aren't that likely to open up a Coral Draw file I expect, since how it's a propritary format, and not that popular.
2010-02-10T23:10:00.000Z	candy	sebsebseb	i tried opening with inkspace but i couldnt see the contents
2010-02-10T23:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy	Have you tired Coral Draw in Wine?
2010-02-10T23:11:00.000Z	candy	sebsebseb	nope coz i want one in ubuntu
2010-02-10T23:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy	Wine runs in Ubuntu, and  when you open up Wine programs it's rather similar to a native app,  it just opens and you can use it
2010-02-10T23:12:00.000Z	candy	sebsebseb	i ll try it
2010-02-10T23:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy	Do you have a Windows CD/DVD?
2010-02-10T23:16:00.000Z	candy	sebsebseb	yep
2010-02-10T23:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy	 Which one? also how much RAM you got?
2010-02-10T23:17:00.000Z	candy	sebsebseb	ram 3 gb, win 7
2010-02-10T23:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy	Wine and  Windows virtual machine's are your options,  unless you can find an alternative program that opens up your file that and is native
2010-02-10T23:19:00.000Z	candy	sebsebseb	hmmm i think i got to use wine till i find one here
2010-02-10T23:23:00.000Z	candy	sebsebseb	yep
2010-02-10T23:23:00.000Z	candy	sebsebseb	how did  u know??
2010-02-10T23:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy	I don't think many guys would call themselves candy on IRC,  good IRC nick by the way
2010-02-10T23:24:00.000Z	candy	sebsebseb	thanks:-)
