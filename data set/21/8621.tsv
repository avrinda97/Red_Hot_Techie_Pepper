2006-03-02T08:13:00.000Z	Tolli^BNC		lol .. idleone how the heck u uninstall things.
2006-03-02T08:14:00.000Z	Tolli^BNC		can anyone please tell me what linux is for use.. its damn slower then windows in desktop mode... its advanced to work with .. and its messy .. ?
2006-03-02T08:14:00.000Z	soundray	Tolli^BNC	not everyone seems to be having the same experience as you.
2006-03-02T08:15:00.000Z	Tolli^BNC		but how can i configure it properly when i never used this thing before.
2006-03-02T08:15:00.000Z	Tolli^BNC		i found linux wery fast using the only base files like only "dos" mode .. but thats impossible to work with
2006-03-02T08:15:00.000Z	soundray	Tolli^BNC	you've come to the right place for help. Just be patient and give it a chance. You will find that it's worth it.
2006-03-02T08:16:00.000Z	Tolli^BNC		well .. random packages is the one the packages the site told me was teh right once.. since i needed apache and acces from my windows somehow to it.
2006-03-02T08:17:00.000Z	soundray	Tolli^BNC	I do all my important stuff on the commandline -- I find GUI's impossible to work with seriously. All a matter of perspective I guess.
2006-03-02T08:17:00.000Z	Tolli^BNC		sundray patient.. hmm well still my linux just gone more and more bugged .. when i type sudo apt-get update it gives me lots of errors.
2006-03-02T08:17:00.000Z	Tolli^BNC	soundray	i would want my linux to be runed only on commandline but since its impossible to get the things to work ... what shall i do?
2006-03-02T08:18:00.000Z	soundray	Tolli^BNC	it's not "linux gone... bugged" -- your sources.list is probably wrong.
2006-03-02T08:18:00.000Z	Tolli^BNC		yeah it is..
2006-03-02T08:18:00.000Z	Tolli^BNC		cuz i changed it with the one that it said on .. the page that was out of date ...
2006-03-02T08:18:00.000Z	Tolli^BNC		cuz it told me it was the way to get the package i wanted to work lol
2006-03-02T08:18:00.000Z	soundray	Tolli^BNC	go to source-o-matic and build a new sources.list from scratch.
2006-03-02T08:18:00.000Z	soundray		!easysource
2006-03-02T08:19:00.000Z	Tolli^BNC		hoary or the other one .. what shall i use?
