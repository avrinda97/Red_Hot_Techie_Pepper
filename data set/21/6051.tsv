2007-06-12T13:03:00.000Z	Stormx2	SinLuZ	Language... Listen, if I find you a guide will you stop bugging us?
2007-06-12T13:03:00.000Z	Stormx2	SinLuZ	Are you on amd64?
2007-06-12T13:04:00.000Z	Stormx2	SinLuZ	Okay. You've downloaded the ndiswrapper source and untarred it, right?
2007-06-12T13:04:00.000Z	Stormx2	SinLuZ	Locate the folder you untarred it too.
2007-06-12T13:05:00.000Z	Stormx2	SinLuZ	Is there a "debian" folder there?
2007-06-12T13:07:00.000Z	Stormx2	SinLuZ	"Note: this is a defunct method written for hoary. Breezy and dapper both come with precompiled ndiswrapper modules. If those do not work try using the instructions on the ndiswrapper website. Dapper includes drivers for broadcom that do not require ndiswrapper as well."
2007-06-12T13:08:00.000Z	Stormx2	SinLuZ	looks like ndiswrapper is installed already.
2007-06-12T13:08:00.000Z	Stormx2	SinLuZ	Find a working guide. Check ubuntuforums.org
