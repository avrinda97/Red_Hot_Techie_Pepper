2007-09-02T10:26:00.000Z	goose		I'm sure this is an incredibly stupid and easy to answer question, but how do I get the shutdown button to go back all the way in the top right corner? it's outside the main tray...
2007-09-02T10:26:00.000Z	MeRodent	goose	right select and unlock the buttons.
2007-09-02T10:26:00.000Z	MeRodent		then right select and choose move.
2007-09-02T10:28:00.000Z	goose	MeRodent	it won't move any further to the right. I have shutdown, a dividing line, ktorrent, xchat, rythembox, wcid, battery, sound, clock
2007-09-02T10:28:00.000Z	MeRodent	goose	are any panel buttons in the spot you want to move the button too that are locked?
2007-09-02T10:29:00.000Z	goose	MeRodent	the clock is..
2007-09-02T10:29:00.000Z	MeRodent	goose	unlock it before you can move anything to the spot.
2007-09-02T10:29:00.000Z	MeRodent		it has to move too.
2007-09-02T10:30:00.000Z	goose	MeRodent	I unlocked the clock, but it still won't let me flush the shutdown button in the far right corner
2007-09-02T10:30:00.000Z	MeRodent	goose	is the shutdown button also unlocked?
2007-09-02T10:30:00.000Z	goose		yes
2007-09-02T10:31:00.000Z	MeRodent	goose	you don't have a double line of dots (handle) there that's locked?
2007-09-02T10:31:00.000Z	goose		ah
2007-09-02T10:31:00.000Z	goose	MeRodent	they were locked
2007-09-02T10:31:00.000Z	MeRodent	goose	bingo?
2007-09-02T10:31:00.000Z	goose		oh shit
2007-09-02T10:32:00.000Z	goose	MeRodent	I clicked remove from panel, now ktorrent, xchat, wicd, and rythembox are all gone
2007-09-02T10:34:00.000Z	MeRodent	goose	just click on add to panel and choose notification area.
2007-09-02T10:34:00.000Z	goose	MeRodent	alright, I got all my icons back
2007-09-02T10:34:00.000Z	goose		thanks
2007-09-02T10:35:00.000Z	MeRodent	goose	no probs.
