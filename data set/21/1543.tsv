2011-01-25T08:17:00.000Z	tacotron		hey guys.. im trying to compile alsa utils from source, when doing make install i get a line: /bin/bash: m: command not found, what is this command??
2011-01-25T08:18:00.000Z	tacotron		the error comes up in the middle of install
2011-01-25T08:18:00.000Z	maco	tacotron	sounds like a bug in whatever script you're running. ive never heard of an "m" command
2011-01-25T08:20:00.000Z	maco	tacotron	alsa and oss are both possible sound drivers / low-leel libraries. alsa has the upstream kernel's blessing, oss does not. they each support a wide range of hardware, but it is not an identical subset, so it's possible switching from one to the other can clear up an issue
2011-01-25T08:21:00.000Z	maco	tacotron	which ALC259 do you have? "lspci -vv | grep -A1 0403"
2011-01-25T08:23:00.000Z	tacotron	maco	that doesnt return anything
2011-01-25T08:24:00.000Z	maco	tacotron	ok how about:  grep Subsystem /proc/asound/card*/codec*
2011-01-25T08:25:00.000Z	maco	tacotron	hang on....given that new versions of alsa are packaged and in the repositories, why were you trying to compile it at all?
2011-01-25T08:25:00.000Z	tacotron	maco	was following the snd-hda-intel guide for ubuntu
2011-01-25T08:26:00.000Z	maco	tacotron	link please? i want to see who's recommending doing that when linux-backports-modules-alsa-maverick-generic exists
2011-01-25T08:26:00.000Z	maco	tacotron	(and -karmic- and -lucid- )
2011-01-25T08:27:00.000Z	maco	tacotron	ALC259 is in no way specific
2011-01-25T08:27:00.000Z	maco	tacotron	but things are fixed on individual hardware basis
2011-01-25T08:28:00.000Z	maco	tacotron	thats why i asked for the Subsystem Id listed in the codec dump
2011-01-25T08:28:00.000Z	tacotron	maco	your command didnt work, said the directory does not exist
2011-01-25T08:29:00.000Z	maco	tacotron	no /proc/asound? oooh well then... thats an interesting level of failure there
2011-01-25T08:29:00.000Z	maco	tacotron	well, unless you already removed alsa, in which case it makes sense
2011-01-25T08:29:00.000Z	maco	tacotron	but alright, have fun with oss. if it doesnt work out, switch back to alsa before asking help in here as oss isnt supported in ubuntu
2011-01-25T08:30:00.000Z	tacotron	maco	alright, thanks
2011-01-25T09:09:00.000Z	tacotron	maco	you said earlier that the latest Alsa stuff is in the repos?
2011-01-25T11:15:00.000Z	tacotron	maco	are you still there?
