2011-02-28T05:01:00.000Z	skutr3_		hello?
2011-02-28T05:02:00.000Z	skutr3_		ok so videos and music on the internet cut out. i think it might be a flash problem... can anyone help?
2011-02-28T05:02:00.000Z	Ampelbein	skutr3_	depends, what flash library are you using, what browser, what hardware?
2011-02-28T05:04:00.000Z	skutr3_	Ampelbein	im using the flash plugin installed by default on ubuntu installation with google chrome (same problem on firefox)
2011-02-28T05:05:00.000Z	Ampelbein	skutr3_	can you run 'dpkg -l | grep flash' and tell me what it says? use pastebin if it's multiple lines please
2011-02-28T05:08:00.000Z	Ampelbein	skutr3_	what processor type do you have?
2011-02-28T05:08:00.000Z	skutr3_	Ampelbein	amd dual core
2011-02-28T05:09:00.000Z	Ampelbein	skutr3_	32 or 64 bit ubuntu?
2011-02-28T05:09:00.000Z	skutr3_	Ampelbein	64 bit
2011-02-28T05:10:00.000Z	Ampelbein	skutr3_	ok, and what graphics adapter are you using? if it's nvidia, what driver?
2011-02-28T05:10:00.000Z	skutr3_	Ampelbein	how do i check that?
2011-02-28T05:11:00.000Z	Ampelbein	skutr3_	'lspci | grep VGA'

2011-02-28T05:14:00.000Z	Ampelbein	skutr3_	can you try right-clicking a flash video, go to settings and enable/disable hardware acceleration and see if that helps?
2011-02-28T05:15:00.000Z	skutr3_	Ampelbein	ok
2011-02-28T05:16:00.000Z	skutr3_	Ampelbein	it was already enable
2011-02-28T05:16:00.000Z	skutr3_	Ampelbein	enabled*
2011-02-28T05:18:00.000Z	Ampelbein	skutr3_	if you are somewhat experienced with ubuntu you can try the 64bit flashplugin from https://launchpad.net/~sevenmachines/+archive/flash, but I wouldn't recommend that if you don't know what you are doing.
2011-02-28T05:18:00.000Z	skutr3_	Ampelbein	ok*
2011-02-28T05:19:00.000Z	Ampelbein	skutr3_	the problem seems to be that the 32bit plugin causes problems in 64bit environments so you'd have to wait till adobe releases a proper 64bit plugin in the official partner repository for ubuntu
2011-02-28T05:20:00.000Z	skutr3_	Ampelbein	but this link should work til then?
