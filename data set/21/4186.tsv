2008-08-05T18:39:00.000Z	Gnea	dmseg	what's your proof that it's a virus?
2008-08-05T18:40:00.000Z	dmseg	Gnea	all machines are automatically downlaoding porn and making icons like "freeporn.exe"
2008-08-05T18:41:00.000Z	Gnea	dmseg	sounds more like a hoard of horny users :)
2008-08-05T18:41:00.000Z	dmseg	Gnea	i dont want to talk on porn but the virus if it is ok
2008-08-05T18:41:00.000Z	Gnea	dmseg	what machines? running ubuntu?
2008-08-05T18:42:00.000Z	dmseg	Gnea	ubuntu 8.04
2008-08-05T18:42:00.000Z	Gnea	dmseg	there's this thing called 'sarcasm', it tends to help break the ice of the situation a bit.. you should consider it now and then
2008-08-05T18:42:00.000Z	Gnea	dmseg	so the links to freeporn.exe are showing up on ubuntu desktops, not wintendo machines?
2008-08-05T18:43:00.000Z	dmseg	Gnea	yep on windows and ubuntu both however freeporn.exe dosent work on ubuntu but yes ubuntu systems are infected too so we shut down the server for now
2008-08-05T18:44:00.000Z	Gnea	dmseg	so what's the problem?
2008-08-05T18:45:00.000Z	Gnea	dmseg	why don't you run a virus scan on the systems and take the virus out?
2008-08-05T18:46:00.000Z	dmseg	Gnea	doing that but the virus sits on samba so when it sees the machines shoop!!! it starts running and iam doing scans on ubuntu with calm av
2008-08-05T18:47:00.000Z	Gnea	dmseg	sounds good - do you have virus scanners working on the wintendo-side of things?
2008-08-05T18:47:00.000Z	dmseg	Gnea	yep and i found it
2008-08-05T18:47:00.000Z	Gnea	dmseg	excellent.

2008-08-05T18:52:00.000Z	Gnea	dmseg	so what sort of virus is it showing up as?
