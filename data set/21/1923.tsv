2010-03-16T09:47:00.000Z	Spaztic_One		anyone know why the system monitor reports CPS usages over 100% ?
2010-03-16T09:47:00.000Z	Spaztic_One		Interesting.
2010-03-16T09:48:00.000Z	Spaztic_One		so, are all apps on linux dual core compatible then?
2010-03-16T09:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spaztic_One	All apps will work with dual core CPUs, but many will only utilize one core at a time.
2010-07-14T04:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spaztic_One	What is the output of "rfkill list"?
2010-07-14T04:28:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Jordan_U	soft block no, hard block yes
2010-07-14T04:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spaztic_One	I assume you've tried rfkill unblock?
2010-07-14T04:29:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Jordan_U	Not yet, wasn't aware of that.
2010-07-14T04:31:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Jordan_U	Doesn't seem to undo the hard block.
2010-07-14T04:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spaztic_One	Didn't expect it to (but it was worth trying). Is there any option for this in the BIOS?
2010-07-14T04:32:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Jordan_U	and Dr_Willis :: It might be worthy of note to say that my wifi button doesn't do anything,. and the status light (for on/off) acts as an activity light, switching between orange and blue as wireless network activity occurs.
2010-07-14T04:33:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Jordan_U	There isn't an option in the BIOS. Closest thing I have found has been enabling booting from a network.
2010-07-14T05:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spaztic_One	Have you tried calling the manufacturer?
2010-07-14T05:06:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Jordan_U	No, And I don't suspect they would care to talk to me. I bought this laptop used off of ebay about 3 weeks ago.
2010-07-14T05:08:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Jordan_U	Also, if it was working and stable, it should be able to become so again, shouldn't it?
2010-07-14T05:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spaztic_One	Yes, but it may require a hardware fix rather than a software one.
2010-07-14T05:09:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Jordan_U	Hmm, would there be any way for me to determine that one way or another myself and then preform the fix on my own?
2010-07-14T05:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spaztic_One	I don't know, you might ask in ##hardware
2010-09-28T04:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spaztic_One	Did you get my answer before I lost my connection?
2010-09-28T04:03:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Jordan_U	no, I did not.
2010-09-28T04:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spaztic_One	You can get to a terminal via ctrl+alt+F1 (ctrl+alt+F7 to get back) then run "DISPLAY=:0.0 metacity --replace"
