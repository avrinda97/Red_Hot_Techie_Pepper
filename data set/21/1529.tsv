2011-03-17T05:03:00.000Z	bl4ckcomb		when installing ubby from the live cd, after partitioning the disks and clicking install, is it normal that the wait cursor is turning around for like 10 minutes without any new window popping up?

2011-03-17T05:12:00.000Z	wechat	bl4ckcomb	you will see a slideshow :) - 15 minutes to make a coffee
2011-03-17T05:13:00.000Z	bl4ckcomb	wechat	I know I'm supposed to see that, but I don't see it...
2011-03-17T05:14:00.000Z	bl4ckcomb	wechat	is it formatting my disks before the slideshow window appears or does it do that while it's on the screen?

2011-03-17T05:15:00.000Z	wechat	bl4ckcomb	o, I don't know exactly. But thereis a checkbox - show much more info in the bottom of the window
2011-03-17T05:15:00.000Z	bl4ckcomb	wechat	I told you twice: there is no window showing up
2011-03-17T05:34:00.000Z	bl4ckcomb	wechat	it seems like the installation was frozen last time. after the reboot everything went fine.
