2006-09-03T06:42:00.000Z	caseyomah		Yes, there is an OSS onboard and no way to disable.
2006-09-03T06:43:00.000Z	caseyomah		OSS doesn't install either, that's why I installed the SB Live! knowing Linux's compatibility with Creative cards.
2006-09-03T06:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	caseyomah	I have never seen an onboard sound card that count not be disabled

2006-09-03T06:43:00.000Z	caseyomah		It doesn't show up in Device Manager and mixer says Gstreamer no cards.
2006-09-03T06:44:00.000Z	caseyomah		First one I've seen too, this is a Compaq Presario 5192.

2006-09-03T06:44:00.000Z	caseyomah		I didn't even bother looking at a hardware interrupt... that's probably it.

2006-09-03T06:47:00.000Z	caseyomah		No return, back to prompt, do I need to su first?
2006-09-03T06:48:00.000Z	caseyomah		I just plugged in a Logitech USB Headset (Playstation 2)...
2006-09-03T06:48:00.000Z	caseyomah		"FATAL: Module emu10k1 not found."
2006-09-03T06:49:00.000Z	caseyomah	BlueEagle	The Logitech works, and shows up in System/Preferance/Sound.

2006-09-03T06:50:00.000Z	caseyomah		That's the point.
2006-09-03T06:52:00.000Z	caseyomah		 grepping emu10k1 or snd-emu10k1 from a lsmod returns nothing.
2006-09-03T06:52:00.000Z	caseyomah		It seems like a hardware detection problem not a driver issue...
2006-09-03T06:53:00.000Z	caseyomah		Unfortunately I can't verify that the BIOS sees the card, it's a junky BIOS.
2006-09-03T06:54:00.000Z	caseyomah		Once again, no return.
