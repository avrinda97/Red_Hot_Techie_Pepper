2009-09-22T10:22:00.000Z	Boffo		i did a chkdsk earlier, because xp wasnt booting at all, just a black screen, so i did it in recovery console, xp works again, but i still cant partition
2009-09-22T10:22:00.000Z	musikgoat		that is the best set of steps, basically what mouseclone said :P
2009-09-22T10:23:00.000Z	Boffo		how long should a defrag take (roughly) on my 250 gig hd with 90 gig's free?
2009-09-22T10:23:00.000Z	musikgoat	Boffo	depends, probly a few hours
2009-09-22T10:24:00.000Z	musikgoat	Boffo	the higher percentage frag the longer, but since you have alot of space it will be quicker
