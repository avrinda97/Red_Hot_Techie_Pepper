2009-04-05T17:51:00.000Z	mrwes	zilleplus	what does your /etc/network/interfaces look like?
2009-04-05T17:53:00.000Z	mrwes	zilleplus	should look something like this http://pastebin.com/f4b813e2d
2009-04-05T17:54:00.000Z	mrwes	zilleplus	that's from my Ubuntu server
2009-04-05T17:55:00.000Z	mrwes	zilleplus	Well.. that should give your server a static IP, or you can set it from the router -- well on most routers
2009-04-05T17:56:00.000Z	mrwes	zilleplus	I'm assuming your router is 192.168.1.1
2009-04-05T17:58:00.000Z	mrwes	zilleplus	the server is 'hard' wired to the router?
2009-04-05T17:59:00.000Z	mrwes	zilleplus	hrmm...the cable is OK?
2009-04-05T18:00:00.000Z	mrwes	zilleplus	from the server, does lspci show the ethernet controller card?
2009-04-05T18:01:00.000Z	mrwes	zilleplus	yah from the server type    lspci
2009-04-05T18:03:00.000Z	mrwes	zilleplus	ok..did you configure your /etc/network/interfaces ?
2009-04-05T18:04:00.000Z	mrwes	zilleplus	your router is 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 ?
