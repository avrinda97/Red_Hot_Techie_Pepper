2005-09-01T15:51:00.000Z	dylanrogers		after enabling dma, must i log off/reboot, etc?
2005-09-01T15:52:00.000Z	ce33na	dylanrogers	how did you enable it?
2005-09-01T15:52:00.000Z	dylanrogers		with the ubuntu wiki page
2005-09-01T15:52:00.000Z	ce33na		did you enter a command at the command line or did you make a config change? I havent read the wiki page
2005-09-01T15:53:00.000Z	dylanrogers	ce33na	i did both
2005-09-01T15:53:00.000Z	ce33na	dylanrogers	if you entered the hdparm command successfully, then you do not need to reboot
2005-09-01T15:54:00.000Z	dylanrogers	ce33na	one last question:  is there a tool out there for linux that will convert mp3s to oggs?
2005-09-01T15:55:00.000Z	ce33na	dylanrogers	yes. I did it in the reverse, so someone could use my ogg files. I do not remember what I used. I do remember checking out Audacity at that time so maybe that was it.
2005-09-01T15:55:00.000Z	dylanrogers	ce33na	could you find out for me?  or does anybody else know?
2005-09-01T15:56:00.000Z	ce33na	dylanrogers	a google search on ogg, mp3, and linux would tell you far more than I could
2005-09-01T15:56:00.000Z	dylanrogers	ce33na	dma is not working
2005-09-01T15:56:00.000Z	ce33na		then the command was not entered correctly
2005-09-01T15:57:00.000Z	ce33na		let me check out the wiki
2005-09-01T15:57:00.000Z	dylanrogers	ce33na	thanks
2005-09-01T15:58:00.000Z	ce33na	dylanrogers	it will take me a few minutes, my boy is playing online games...they are bandwidth hogs
2005-09-02T16:01:00.000Z	ce33na	dylanrogers	the hdparm command in the wiki does not enable dma, it only shows your current setup
2005-09-02T16:01:00.000Z	ce33na	dylanrogers	let me see if I can find some good documentation on hdparm
2005-09-02T16:02:00.000Z	ce33na	dylanrogers	oops...I stand corrected. It does show how to enable dma
2005-09-02T16:03:00.000Z	ce33na		  "sudo hdparm -d1 /dev/hdc" enables dma on hdc (usually the cdrom)
2005-09-02T16:06:00.000Z	dylanrogers	ce33na	ill try
2005-09-02T16:07:00.000Z	dylanrogers	ce33na	its on
