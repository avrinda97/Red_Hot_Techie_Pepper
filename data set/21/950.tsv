2012-09-04T00:55:00.000Z	[twisti]		ever since upgrading from LTS 10 to LTS 12 precise, i get these error messages on login. reboot doesnt fix them. can someone help me figure out what to do about it/what it means ? *** /dev/md2 will be checked for errors at next reboot *** *** /dev/md1 will be checked for errors at next reboot ***
2012-09-04T00:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	[twisti]	after a certain number of mounts, the filesystems are fscked whether they need it or not
2012-09-04T00:58:00.000Z	[twisti]	gordonjcp	i would happily accept that, if they were
2012-09-04T00:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	[twisti]	tried fscking manually?
2012-09-04T00:58:00.000Z	[twisti]	gordonjcp	dont really know what that is or how i would do that
2012-10-27T01:50:00.000Z	gordonjcp	[twisti]	read up on ssh-keygen
2012-10-27T01:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	[twisti]	basically you can generate a pair of keys for encryption, one of which you keep secret and one of which you can disseminate widely
2012-10-27T01:52:00.000Z	[twisti]	gordonjcp	do you understand from the context of that site what the identification IS FOR ?
2012-10-27T01:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	[twisti]	yes
2012-10-27T01:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	[twisti]	that's it exactly
2012-10-27T01:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	[twisti]	if you wanted me to access your server, you'd ask me for my public key
2012-10-27T01:54:00.000Z	gordonjcp	[twisti]	the trick is, the keys work in pairs and if you encrypt with one you must decrypt with the other
2012-10-27T01:54:00.000Z	gordonjcp	[twisti]	imagine a cashbox you can only lock with one key and unlock with a different key
2012-10-27T01:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	[twisti]	what are you committing it to?
2012-10-27T01:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	[twisti]	or rather, what exactly are you trying to do here?
2012-10-27T01:55:00.000Z	[twisti]	gordonjcp	the git server that hopefully ill have running by the end of that advice
2012-10-27T01:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	[twisti]	right
2012-10-27T01:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	[twisti]	well, if you're connecting to remote servers via SSH you probably want to be using sshkeys anyway
2012-10-27T01:56:00.000Z	[twisti]	gordonjcp	for a very loose definition of 'want' :|
2012-10-27T01:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	[twisti]	yes, it's a pain in the backside right now, because it's all new, you don't understand it, and you can't see where it's useful
2012-10-27T01:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	[twisti]	stick with it and you'll see exactly why it's useful :-)
