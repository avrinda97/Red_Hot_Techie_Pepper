2008-04-05T13:32:00.000Z	pajamian	Cyborg	unop_ just gave you a link which will help you.  Your problem is that you have a version of ubuntu that is too old to have ntfs support.
2008-04-05T13:34:00.000Z	pajamian	Cyborg	you need ntfs-3g as many have already said, but your version of ubuntu doesn't supply it, so you need to do a bit mroe work to get it going.  Read the info at the link unop_ gave you it is the best help you will get.

2008-04-05T13:40:00.000Z	pajamian	Cyborg	this is the title of the page that unop_ linked to: NTFS-3G - Read & Write NTFS in Linux plus specific Ubuntu Dapper install instructions
2008-04-05T13:40:00.000Z	pajamian	Cyborg	note the "specific Ubuntu Dapper install instructions"
2008-04-05T13:41:00.000Z	pajamian	Cyborg	follow those "instructions" and ntfs will work.
2008-04-05T13:41:00.000Z	pajamian	Cyborg	end of story.
