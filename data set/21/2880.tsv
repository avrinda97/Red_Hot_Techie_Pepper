2009-07-13T05:34:00.000Z	jvogel	Reitz	theres a way you can get a copy from Dell
2009-07-13T05:34:00.000Z	jvogel	Reitz	theres a form you fill out
2009-07-13T05:35:00.000Z	jvogel	Reitz	http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dellcare/en/backupcd_form?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs&redirect=1
2009-07-13T05:39:00.000Z	jvogel	Reitz	use link igot you for discs
2009-07-13T05:39:00.000Z	jvogel	Reitz	iso is probably INSIDE rar
2009-07-13T05:39:00.000Z	jvogel	Reitz	extract rar (unrar)
2009-07-13T05:41:00.000Z	jvogel	Reitz	... you need to unrar the file d00d
2009-07-13T05:41:00.000Z	jvogel	Reitz	terminal --> unrar file.rar
2009-07-13T05:41:00.000Z	jvogel	Reitz	then iso should be in there assuming that's what you wanted to install
2009-07-13T05:43:00.000Z	jvogel	Reitz	do you have unrarA?
2009-07-13T05:43:00.000Z	jvogel	Reitz	sudo apt-get install unrar
