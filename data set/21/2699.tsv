2010-01-08T02:44:00.000Z	JenniferB		how can I see what ports are listening for traffic ?
2010-01-08T02:44:00.000Z	JenniferB		how can I make sure that no known has entered and left a backdoor
2010-01-08T02:46:00.000Z	airtonix	JenniferB	try running : onboard
2010-01-08T02:47:00.000Z	airtonix	JenniferB	woops mistell
2010-01-08T02:50:00.000Z	JenniferB	airtonix	where you talking to me ?
2010-01-08T02:50:00.000Z	airtonix	JenniferB	no it was a mistell
2010-01-08T02:52:00.000Z	airtonix	JenniferB	you can use jnettop
2010-01-08T02:55:00.000Z	airtonix	JenniferB	i use this command in a desktop shortcut to do this : xterm -geometry 200x124+30+400 -e watch -d "netstat -ntauple" &
2010-01-08T02:55:00.000Z	airtonix	JenniferB	the relevant part of that is : netstat -ntauple
2010-01-08T02:58:00.000Z	airtonix	JenniferB	which one are you looking at ? netstat or jnettop ?
2010-01-08T02:58:00.000Z	airtonix	JenniferB	look at the program on the far right
2010-01-08T03:01:00.000Z	JenniferB	airtonix	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/m6615a266
2010-01-08T03:03:00.000Z	airtonix	JenniferB	ports which where used previously
2010-01-08T03:03:00.000Z	airtonix	JenniferB	you'll see every two seconds that when netstat updates the screen you'll see the changes get highlighted
2010-01-08T03:04:00.000Z	airtonix	JenniferB	yes, you may find jnettop a bit more sane to give you this information
2010-01-08T03:05:00.000Z	airtonix	JenniferB	actually i mean this command : watch -d "netstat -ntauple"
2010-01-08T03:07:00.000Z	airtonix	JenniferB	jnettop won't tell you the program using the connection though,
2010-01-08T03:08:00.000Z	airtonix	JenniferB	which is why i use this script in my ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/monitor-connections.sh (http://paste.ubuntu.com/353153/)
2010-01-08T03:10:00.000Z	JenniferB	airtonix	I saved that script, thanks very much.. xterm is graphical ?
2010-01-08T03:11:00.000Z	airtonix	JenniferB	the xterm is there because i use it from a gui desktop, you can just run  : watch -d "netstat -ntauple"
2010-01-08T03:11:00.000Z	JenniferB	airtonix	got it.. thanks again :)
