2008-09-02T19:25:00.000Z	leeping2008		Hey there, I've looked at many .screenrc files on the Internet, and not one of them tells me how to bind my mouse buttons to certain functions.  Basically, I want to turn copy-mode on and off using my mouse buttons 4 and 5, but I don't know how to bind the buttons to certain functions!  Can anyone tell me how to do this?  Thanks!
2008-09-02T19:26:00.000Z	MikeSeth	leeping2008	I don't think screen interacts with a mouse at all
2008-09-02T19:26:00.000Z	MikeSeth	leeping2008	actually it does have limited mouse support but it isnt mentioned in the manpage
2008-09-02T19:27:00.000Z	leeping2008	MikeSeth	and erUSUL, thanks... kind of a shame though, currently I can scroll with the mouse wheel in copy mode, it would just be very nice to activate and deactivate the mode with mouse buttons, much like binding key presses... maybe I can translate mouse buttons into key presses using Xmodmap??
2008-09-02T19:28:00.000Z	MikeSeth	leeping2008	the scrolling feature is implemented in VT, not in screen itself as far as I know
2008-09-02T19:28:00.000Z	MikeSeth	leeping2008	imo if you are the kind of person that uses screen to the point of writing your own rc files, you may want to get AWAY from the mouse
2008-09-02T19:28:00.000Z	leeping2008	MikeSeth	I'm actually using gnome-terminal with screen.  When copy mode is off, the mouse wheel scrolls the command history.  With copy mode on, I can scroll in the scroll-buffer.
2008-09-02T19:29:00.000Z	MikeSeth	leeping2008	oh. Then you may want to apt-get source screen and look at the Ubuntu-specific patches
2008-09-02T19:29:00.000Z	leeping2008	MikeSeth	I don't think I'll ever get away from using the mouse - I'm using screen mainly for its detachability, it's really awesome
2008-09-02T19:29:00.000Z	leeping2008	MikeSeth	thanks. I'll look at those ... but perhaps I'll look at xmodmap first and map button presses to keystrokes
2008-09-02T19:29:00.000Z	MikeSeth	leeping2008	you would. You'll get hooked on emacs and you'll despise everything GUI ;>
2008-09-02T19:30:00.000Z	leeping2008	MikeSeth	I do use emacs, but I still like to have it in windows ;P
2008-09-02T19:30:00.000Z	MikeSeth	leeping2008	I am on Windows right now and I am not using my mouse at all
2008-09-02T19:30:00.000Z	MikeSeth		;>
2008-09-02T19:31:00.000Z	leeping2008	MikeSeth	wow.  But why stay away from using a mouse?  Pointing and clicking is inherently convenient in many situations
2008-09-02T19:31:00.000Z	MikeSeth	leeping2008	because switching hands interrupts thought flow
2008-09-02T19:31:00.000Z	leeping2008	MikeSeth	never heard that before.  Sounds interesting though. :)
2008-09-02T19:32:00.000Z	MikeSeth	leeping2008	generally, knowing basic emacs/shell keys makes you productive in many, many applications
2008-09-02T19:32:00.000Z	leeping2008	MikeSeth	do you use the emacs shell?
2008-09-02T19:32:00.000Z	MikeSeth	leeping2008	in the time between your and mine last line, I switched to MSN to write a couple of lines to the boss, jumped to a box to start the bots, and opened a new term with manual pages - interaction non-stop
2008-09-02T19:33:00.000Z	MikeSeth	leeping2008	yeap
