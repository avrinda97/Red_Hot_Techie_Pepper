2008-10-31T04:43:00.000Z	scientes	jrib	or the full capibilities of your hardware....
2008-11-05T18:14:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	depends on the 3rb party
2008-11-05T18:15:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	in general, if a package does not override an existing package (especially libraries), it's probably ok
2008-11-06T18:09:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	gdmflexiserver -nl
2008-11-17T05:08:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	why?
2008-11-17T05:09:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	you aren't making sense
2008-11-17T05:10:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	try to keep responses on a single line.  What exactly is your issue?
2008-11-17T05:11:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	so just grab the tar.gz from adobe's site
2008-11-17T05:12:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	though really on intrepid, nspluginwrapper is a lot better.  My browser has not crashed once
2008-11-17T05:13:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	you just copy the .so to the right directory
2008-11-19T04:43:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	huh?
2008-11-21T01:49:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	the fixing part isn't ugly :)
2008-11-25T08:40:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	#ubuntu-offtopic
2012-04-13T02:55:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	use a symlink
2012-04-13T02:55:00.000Z	scientes	jrib	but that doesn't deal with language changing
2012-04-13T02:56:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	how so?  Maybe I don't understand what exactly you want to accomplish.  Anyway, those things are defined in ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs
2012-04-13T03:00:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	what exactly do you want to happen?  Give a specific example please.
2012-04-13T03:01:00.000Z	scientes	jrib	i think i am going to use the sticky bit. Anyways, 4 users, homes on SSDs, their media and downloads go the the hard drive, but they dont have to know that. if you create a new user and it asks "do you want to change the names of /Music, etc" then it will still work, and the same with new users
2012-04-13T03:01:00.000Z	scientes	jrib	seems like i could change that file in /etc/skel
2012-04-13T03:03:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	the system-wide config is in /etc/xdg.  Though it seems like you can't avoid creating symlinks unless you don't care that the users won't have those directories available to them under their $HOME
2012-04-13T03:03:00.000Z	jrib	scientes	when in doubt, go with default: ext4
