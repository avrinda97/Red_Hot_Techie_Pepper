2005-05-07T16:46:00.000Z	Janux		how do you take screenshot in Ubuntu?
2005-05-07T16:47:00.000Z	holy_cow	Janux	print screen also works
2005-05-07T16:48:00.000Z	holy_cow	Janux	alt / prt screen takes snapshot of app window only
2005-05-07T06:13:00.000Z	holy_cow	Janux	you can load a knoppix live cd all into ramdisk sure
2005-05-07T06:13:00.000Z	holy_cow	Janux	you would be surprised just how 'unfast' programs actually load :)
2005-05-07T06:13:00.000Z	holy_cow	Janux	it's not that impressive to be perfectly honest
2005-05-07T06:14:00.000Z	Janux	holy_cow	really....hmm.....cuz some programs that I run really loads very slowly for startup...
2005-05-07T06:15:00.000Z	holy_cow	Janux	open office is slow, gimp is slow relatively speaking
2005-05-07T06:15:00.000Z	Janux	holy_cow	ya, what about gimp? if I put it on RAM does it load faster?
2005-05-07T06:15:00.000Z	Janux	holy_cow	ic ic...
2005-05-07T06:16:00.000Z	holy_cow	Janux	yes, but it's not so significantly faster to really be worth the trouble to set it up
2005-05-07T06:16:00.000Z	holy_cow	Janux	actually get a knoppix cd, load it into ram there is a boot command line you pass to it to do that
2005-05-07T06:16:00.000Z	Janux	holy_cow	ya I heard that loading Ramdisk is just a kernel boot command
2005-05-07T06:17:00.000Z	holy_cow	Janux	i was expecting it to be faster but to be honest the executables still haveto run, check stuff, setup stuff, claim resources and so on, so not unexpected
2005-05-07T06:18:00.000Z	holy_cow	Janux	as opposed to say having a running application already in the background, opening up a new window in open office or gimp is instantaneous because requesting a new window for example is orders of magnitude less than starting up the initial binaries
2005-05-07T06:18:00.000Z	holy_cow	Janux	in other words, depends how you look at the whole process
2005-05-07T06:19:00.000Z	Janux	holy_cow	ic....cuz I really like the idea of ramdisk
2005-05-07T06:19:00.000Z	holy_cow	Janux	then try knoppix all in ram, see for your self
2005-05-07T06:20:00.000Z	Janux	holy_cow	true...what about Ubuntu Live CD? same thing?
2005-05-07T06:20:00.000Z	holy_cow	Janux	i don't know if that has all to ram capability
2005-05-07T06:21:00.000Z	Janux	holy_cow	okay..I will try both...hehee...thx a lot
