2007-05-04T14:15:00.000Z	brainiac8008		i have dapper.  If I have the feisty disk, when I install, can I just put it in ext3 over Dapper?
2007-05-04T14:16:00.000Z	soundray	brainiac8008	you could, but it's best to (have a backup and) tell the installer to format the dapper root partition.
2007-05-04T14:17:00.000Z	brainiac8008	soundray	how do i format the dapper root partition?
2007-05-04T14:17:00.000Z	soundray	brainiac8008	it's a tick box in the feisty installer.
2007-05-04T14:18:00.000Z	soundray	brainiac8008	choose manual partitioning
2007-05-04T14:18:00.000Z	brainiac8008	soundray	so all I have to do is backup, do a format of the dapper root partition, and then install feisty?
2007-05-04T14:18:00.000Z	brainiac8008	soundray	and what is the "dapper root partition"?  ext3?
2007-05-04T14:19:00.000Z	soundray	brainiac8008	even easier. You let the installer do it all for you.
2007-05-04T14:20:00.000Z	soundray	brainiac8008	by dapper root partition I mean the partition where the system files of your old installation went. Yes, it's very probably ext3-formatted.
2007-05-04T14:20:00.000Z	brainiac8008	soundray	i don't feel very comfortable by letting it doing it all automatically if that's what you mean
2007-05-04T14:21:00.000Z	soundray	brainiac8008	the installer (ubiquity by name) is so well tested that you're more likely to screw up than it (at least if you're like me ;)
2007-05-04T14:22:00.000Z	brainiac8008	soundray	but won't I have to tell it somehow that I want ext3 formatted?
2007-05-04T14:23:00.000Z	soundray	brainiac8008	no. If you want anything other than ext3, you have to use the Alternate CD.
2007-05-04T14:25:00.000Z	brainiac8008	soundray	I do want ext3 but you said before that there is a tick box in manual mode to tell it to format ext3.  If I select automatic mode, how will it know to format it?  and how will it know that I don't want to create a second ext3 partition?
2007-05-04T14:25:00.000Z	soundray	brainiac8008	there is a tick box to format it. You don't get a choice as to the file system.
2007-05-04T14:26:00.000Z	soundray	brainiac8008	you've got a backup, right? Stop worrying and get to work (is my suggestion)
2007-05-04T14:26:00.000Z	brainiac8008	soundray	thanks, i'll work on it.  I just don't want to screw up my hard drive with more partitions than I want.
2007-05-04T14:27:00.000Z	soundray	brainiac8008	there is very little danger of that.
2007-05-04T14:27:00.000Z	brainiac8008	soundray	ok, thanks again.  see ya
2007-05-13T13:44:00.000Z	soundray	brainiac8008	just go through the install process. Choose manual partitioning. ubiquity will find your swap partition and offer you ways of using it.
2007-05-13T13:45:00.000Z	brainiac8008	soundray	okay, ty.
