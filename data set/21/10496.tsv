2005-02-17T13:59:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Shinitenshi	totem-xine
2005-02-17T13:59:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Shinitenshi	You'll need to install libdvdcss as well.  totem-xine is integrated well with GNOME.
2005-02-18T11:09:00.000Z	Shinitenshi	ficusplanet	its installed
2005-02-18T11:10:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Shinitenshi	Download that and then run sudo ndiswrapper -i on the inf file that is in the WinXP folder of that zip.  OK?
2005-02-18T11:11:00.000Z	Shinitenshi	ficusplanet	band url
2005-02-18T11:11:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Shinitenshi	Try this one: http://web.belkin.com/support/download/downloaddetails.asp?file_id=1431
2005-02-18T11:12:00.000Z	Shinitenshi	ficusplanet	i tried getting it yesterday but iwas a bad url, so i got the exe from the belkin site
2005-02-18T11:13:00.000Z	Shinitenshi	ficusplanet	i downloaded the windows driver yesterday its in my home dir, its just the version 2 instead of the 3rd
2005-02-18T11:13:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Shinitenshi	OK.  I'll post the realtek drivers on my server.  Just a sec.
2005-02-18T11:13:00.000Z	Shinitenshi	ficusplanet	thx
2005-02-18T11:13:00.000Z	Shinitenshi	ficusplanet	that driver is for ver 3 my card is ver 2
2005-02-18T11:15:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Shinitenshi	That's the card and the model number, but if you run lspci you should be able to get a chipset, too.
2005-02-18T11:16:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Shinitenshi	It's no problem.  Just run lspci in a terminal and then look for the section that refers to your wireless card.
2005-02-18T11:18:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Shinitenshi	I don't think so.  I expect it will mention belkin
2005-02-18T11:19:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Shinitenshi	That output may also contain rtl8180 somewhere.  If you having trouble, you can just post the output somewhere and I'll look through it.
2005-02-18T11:19:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Shinitenshi	Could you post or email the output of lspci to me?
2005-02-18T11:21:00.000Z	Shinitenshi	ficusplanet	ok check your mail
2005-02-18T11:22:00.000Z	Shinitenshi	ficusplanet	brb
