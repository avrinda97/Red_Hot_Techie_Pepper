2012-02-08T06:40:00.000Z	nnatomltop		Can some one explain to me why ubuntu went with a program called apt daemon  ... That eats all the cpu and seems to fail at its job half the time.
2012-02-08T06:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nnatomltop	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-02-08T06:43:00.000Z	nnatomltop	ActionParsnip	Sadly Apt-Daemon was the last straw for me.  I tried to tolerate ubuntu.  I switched all 4 systems over to Debian. The one last ubuntu system I just kill apt daemon every time it starts up and manually tell apt-get to upgrade.
2012-02-08T06:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nnatomltop	so why are you here? This is a support channel...?
2012-02-08T06:44:00.000Z	nnatomltop	ActionParsnip	Because I am hopeing you can give me an idea of how to remove apt-daemon for good from my last remaining system. I don't have time to deal with it.
2012-02-08T06:49:00.000Z	nnatomltop	ActionParsnip	I needed a simple system that my clients can use.  Not one that changes entirely every upgrade.  After ubuntu switched to Unity fully and messed up the updating system.   I had to remove my social and phisical support of the system. I can no longer trust ubuntu.   I seem to still be cleaning up the mess.
2012-02-08T06:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nnatomltop	you don't have to use unity
2012-02-08T06:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nnatomltop	I use LXDE and there is no Unity there. Also if you use xfce or KDE or ANY other DE, you will not get Unity by default
2012-02-08T06:53:00.000Z	nnatomltop	ActionParsnip	Alright I will have to figure that out later.   Still I preferred ubuntu when it was simple and sleak, close to Debian.  ....   Do I just use apt-get install gnome to get back to the base system ?
2012-02-08T06:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nnatomltop	Unity is a shell for Gnome, you already have gnome installed if you are using Unity
2012-02-08T06:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nnatomltop	I suggest you run:  sudo apt-get install xfce4    and install xfce, use the xfce session and it will feel like Gnome2
2012-02-08T06:56:00.000Z	nnatomltop	ActionParsnip	How do I switch shells?  and remove apt-daemon .....  742MB ram for the base system is unacceptable I feel like I am using windows.    One last question How does unity interact with the system and is it disabled by default?
2012-02-08T06:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nnatomltop	if you install gnome-shell you can press ALT+F2 and run:  gnome-shell --repace   and use that
2012-02-08T06:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nnatomltop	if you wnat to switch desktop (not shell) then you need to log off and select it at login
2012-02-08T06:59:00.000Z	nnatomltop	ActionParsnip	Thanks.    Do you know what apt-daemon was supposed to accomplish.  It really confuses me.  Its like a big fancy annoying thing for what should be a simple user initiated simple public task.
2012-02-08T06:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nnatomltop	not sure, is it ran as root or as user?
2012-02-08T07:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nnatomltop	could try marking it as not executable and reboot, see if it helps :) You can always boot to liveCD and tweak it back if it causes issues
2012-02-08T07:00:00.000Z	nnatomltop	ActionParsnip	It seems to be run as root.  Does not seem to talk to the update manager well.  Eats a lot of cpu and dosn't show what its doing.  I have a habit of killing things that I don't know what they are doing.
2012-02-08T07:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nnatomltop	https://launchpad.net/aptdaemon shows what it does
2012-02-08T07:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nnatomltop	you can also see the bugs reported for the package
2012-02-08T07:05:00.000Z	nnatomltop	ActionParsnip	Frankly that discription scares me, As a sys admin I don't want things out of my control.  I like to know EXACTLY what my computer is doing and why and who did it.  Aptdaemon almost is like saying, Users we now allow you to be stupid and install anything you like, Including viruses.
