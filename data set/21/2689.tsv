2009-07-25T20:39:00.000Z	thepeon		ssh mike@192.168.1.1
2009-07-25T20:41:00.000Z	thepeon		opps, sorry, ip is 192.168.1.103
2009-07-25T20:41:00.000Z	ztw4726	thepeon	try   nc 192.168.1.1 22   you should see something like: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_4.7p1 Debian-8ubuntu1.2
2009-07-25T20:42:00.000Z	thepeon	ztw4726	would I run that on the server or client?
2009-07-25T20:42:00.000Z	ztw4726	thepeon	on the client if 192.168.1.1 is the servers's ip
2009-07-25T20:43:00.000Z	thepeon	ztw4726	burkmat it's sitting, no connection no error yet
2009-07-25T20:44:00.000Z	ztw4726	thepeon	then you cannot reach the server on tcp port 22
2009-07-25T20:44:00.000Z	ztw4726	thepeon	check if any iptables rules on the server block incoming traffic
2009-07-25T20:48:00.000Z	ztw4726	thepeon	how did you check?
2009-07-25T20:51:00.000Z	ztw4726	thepeon	does the server have more than one ethernet interface?
2009-07-25T20:52:00.000Z	thepeon	ztw4726	yes, but it's not currently connected
2009-07-25T20:53:00.000Z	ztw4726	thepeon	try running tcpdump on the server's interface which is connected to the switch: sudo tcpdump -ni ethX   (where X could be 0 or 1)
2009-07-25T20:55:00.000Z	thepeon	ztw4726	ok, now what am i looking for with the tcpdump?
2009-07-25T20:55:00.000Z	ztw4726	thepeon	you look for tcp port 22 packets
2009-07-25T20:57:00.000Z	thepeon	ztw4726	ok, not seeing anything and I tried connecting from the client with tcpdump running
2009-07-25T20:57:00.000Z	ztw4726	thepeon	then the packets aren't physically arriving on the server
2009-07-25T20:58:00.000Z	ztw4726	thepeon	try ping and see if tcpdump shows that
2009-07-25T20:58:00.000Z	thepeon	ztw4726	seeing the ping
2009-07-25T20:59:00.000Z	ztw4726	thepeon	then something IS filtering the port 22 traffic
2009-07-25T20:59:00.000Z	ztw4726	thepeon	you pinged the server from the client, right?
2009-07-25T21:00:00.000Z	thepeon	ztw4726	yes
