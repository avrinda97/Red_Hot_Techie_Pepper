2011-02-07T21:47:00.000Z	NikS		Got a doubt, I downloaded compiz, but none of the effects are working..!
2011-02-07T21:48:00.000Z	NikS		I enabled cube, and rotate cube.. nothing..! also downloaded compiz fusion icon to be sure that compiz is enabled..
2011-02-07T21:48:00.000Z	Fuchs	NikS	does  ps aux | grep -i compiz   report it as running?
2011-02-07T21:54:00.000Z	NikS	Fuchs	do not understand the output, should I paste it here?
2011-02-07T21:54:00.000Z	Fuchs	NikS	no. Use a pastebin.
2011-02-07T21:55:00.000Z	NikS	Fuchs	*I* do not understand the output,  should I paste it here? <edit>
2011-02-07T22:00:00.000Z	NikS	Fuchs	here is the link: http://paste.ubuntu.com/563966/
2011-02-07T22:01:00.000Z	Fuchs	NikS	compiz is not running
2011-02-07T22:01:00.000Z	Fuchs	NikS	try  compiz -replace & disown
2011-02-07T22:07:00.000Z	NikS	Fuchs	something happened and I lost the title bars of all windows.. keyboard input was not working as well.. tried to launch compiz fusion icon, and brought it all back.. but still cant rotate the desk..
2011-02-07T22:08:00.000Z	Fuchs	NikS	yes, because probably now compiz again is not running
2011-02-07T22:08:00.000Z	Fuchs	NikS	it would be good to have the error messages that came when you tried to launch it
2011-02-07T22:12:00.000Z	NikS	Fuchs	here is the link: http://paste.ubuntu.com/563969/
2011-02-07T22:12:00.000Z	Fuchs	NikS	your graphic card is blacklisted
2011-02-07T22:12:00.000Z	NikS	Fuchs	some drivers missing or something? mine is quite an old pc..! Blacklisted?? did not get it!
2011-02-07T22:13:00.000Z	Fuchs	NikS	the compiz developers keep a list of hardware on which compiz is not supported. Your graphic card is on that list.
2011-02-07T22:14:00.000Z	Fuchs	NikS	there used to be a way to work around this blacklist (even though it is not recommended), but Ubuntu disabled that in it's packages.
2011-02-07T22:14:00.000Z	NikS	Fuchs	ohh..! :( that is bad!
2011-02-07T22:15:00.000Z	NikS	Fuchs	anyway, I am quite happy with the way ubuntu looks by default.. Animations can wait for my next pc! :) thanks for your help and time! much appreciated! :)
2011-02-07T22:17:00.000Z	Fuchs	NikS	no problem, have fun with ubuntu anyway
2011-02-07T22:17:00.000Z	NikS	Fuchs	:)
