2007-08-10T12:39:00.000Z	Pelo	dresden	  the path shuld be  /media/nameofthedriveonyourdesktop
2007-08-10T12:40:00.000Z	Pelo	dresden	 in ubuntu  ntfs partitions are read only by default,  it is not someting wrong that you did,  to make them read/wirte you need to perform a few extra operations,  I am not sure they will be permanent with a usb drive
2007-08-10T12:41:00.000Z	Pelo	dresden	 if it appears on your desktop just rightl click and pick unmount in the menu
2007-08-10T12:43:00.000Z	Pelo	dresden	    from the terminal    sudo umount /media/Black64
2007-08-10T12:47:00.000Z	Pelo	dresden	great
2007-08-10T12:47:00.000Z	Pelo	dresden	try just unpluging and plugging in it ,  usb should mount automaticaly
2007-08-10T12:48:00.000Z	Pelo	dresden	 make sure it is powered on
2007-08-10T12:48:00.000Z	Pelo	dresden	internal drives  is  sudo mount /dev/sd**  /mountpoint
2007-08-10T12:49:00.000Z	Pelo	dresden	 you need to have a mountpoint made    sudo mkdir /****     use something in /media if you want it to show on your desktop or  in /mnt if you don'T
2007-08-10T12:52:00.000Z	Pelo	dresden	 we love you to
2007-08-10T12:52:00.000Z	Pelo	dresden	 sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
