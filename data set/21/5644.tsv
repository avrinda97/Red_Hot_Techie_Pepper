2007-10-19T07:11:00.000Z	cdm10	Ward1983	go to System>Admin>Update Manager and hit Check
2007-10-19T07:11:00.000Z	cdm10	Ward1983	but I'd wait a few days, until the servers speed up.
2007-10-19T07:12:00.000Z	Ward1983	cdm10	and should not all my applications keep working, can i go easily back?
2007-10-19T07:12:00.000Z	cdm10	Ward1983	No, you'll have to reinstall.
2007-10-19T07:12:00.000Z	Ward1983	cdm10	all of my software?
2007-10-19T07:13:00.000Z	cdm10	Ward1983	if stuff breaks during the upgrade, you may be able to fix it by asking here. Otherwise, you may need to reinstall Ubuntu.
2007-10-19T07:14:00.000Z	Ward1983	cdm10	i'm talking about my software, if some of it does not work after the successfull update.. what can i do?
2008-05-25T06:08:00.000Z	cdm10	Ward1983	Somewhat... try asking
2008-05-25T06:09:00.000Z	Ward1983	cdm10	ok thanx, well i followed page 75 of their manual, someone from #ubuntu-nl advised me to do that
2008-05-25T06:09:00.000Z	cdm10	Ward1983	what's your question?
2008-05-25T06:09:00.000Z	Ward1983	cdm10	but now my system has no connection to the internet anymore :s
2008-05-25T06:09:00.000Z	cdm10	Ward1983	I'm afraid I can't really help with that...
2008-05-25T06:09:00.000Z	Ward1983	cdm10	no prob maybe someone else :)
2008-05-25T06:10:00.000Z	cdm10	Ward1983	can you send me a link to the manual you read? We might be able to try to reverse what you did...
2008-05-25T06:10:00.000Z	Ward1983	cdm10	that link would be on the desktop, can give it to you in a bit, im outside with my laptop atm

2008-05-25T06:12:00.000Z	Ward1983	cdm10	http://www.virtualbox.org/download/1.6.0/UserManual.pdf
2008-05-25T06:12:00.000Z	cdm10	Ward1983	ugh, sorry, I'm totally out of my depth here... Linux networking is not something I'm familiar with.
