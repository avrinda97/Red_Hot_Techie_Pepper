2011-06-02T08:29:00.000Z	Gskellig		yeah raju "ubuntu" is unity and "ubuntu classic" is gnome
2011-06-02T08:29:00.000Z	Gskellig		i choose "ubuntu"
2011-06-02T08:29:00.000Z	Gskellig		but still no unity
2011-06-02T08:30:00.000Z	Raikia	Gskellig	try "killall mutter"
2011-06-02T08:34:00.000Z	Raikia	Gskellig	try typing "unity" command?
2011-06-02T08:38:00.000Z	Raikia	Gskellig	Now, does it should you a normal gnome desktop interface?  or just, like, a background picture?
2011-06-02T08:39:00.000Z	Gskellig	Raikia	its normal gnome
2011-06-02T08:40:00.000Z	Raikia	Gskellig	It might be because it detects that your computer doesnt have the specifications required to run unity, so it goes to gnome
2011-06-02T08:41:00.000Z	Raikia	Gskellig	Because it does do that.
2011-06-02T08:42:00.000Z	Raikia	Gskellig	Go to System -> Administration -> Additional Drivers.  Are any listed (that say "not used")
2011-06-02T08:44:00.000Z	Raikia	Gskellig	If natty is booting into a full gnome environment, it definitely is detecting your hardware is incapable to run unity.  My only thought is that the LiveCD auto-activated your other graphics card, and wubi read your Windows configuration to get access to the graphics cards (so it was mis-interpreted)
2011-06-02T08:44:00.000Z	Raikia	Gskellig	I'm not a professional at this at all....I'm just trying to help :-/
2011-06-02T08:45:00.000Z	Raikia	Gskellig	My only suggestion is to install that nvidia driver, see if it works with it, and then uninstall it if it doesnt
2011-06-02T08:45:00.000Z	Raikia	Gskellig	The LiveCD auto-activates drivers that your computer needs
2011-06-02T08:45:00.000Z	Raikia	Gskellig	why?
2011-06-02T08:50:00.000Z	Gskellig	Raikia	"unable to create openGL context" and "Xlib: extension GLX missing on display ":0.0".
2011-06-02T08:56:00.000Z	Raikia	Gskellig	lspci -v
2011-06-02T09:02:00.000Z	Raikia	Gskellig	^
2011-06-02T09:03:00.000Z	Raikia	Gskellig	So you need to install/use a better driver
