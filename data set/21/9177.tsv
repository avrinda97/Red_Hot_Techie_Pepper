2006-10-17T14:25:00.000Z	jenda		Is there a good GUI configuration tool for wireless networking?

2006-10-17T14:26:00.000Z	jenda		err... susscorfa: thx
2006-10-17T14:26:00.000Z	canllaith	jenda	if you want to configure it, try network-manager-gnome.
2006-10-17T14:27:00.000Z	canllaith		netstumbler is for wardriving.
2006-10-17T14:28:00.000Z	jenda	canllaith	That's not the default gnome network-admin, is it? (DL'ing 200 megs of edgy updates, so can't check apt)
2006-10-17T14:28:00.000Z	canllaith	jenda	No, it's much nicer :)
2006-10-17T14:29:00.000Z	jenda	canllaith	will check. thx
2006-10-17T14:29:00.000Z	jenda	canllaith	the wardriving issue not that bad either, though :) I'm doing it for various univ. networks, so I dunno how this will work...
2006-10-17T14:30:00.000Z	canllaith	jenda	I have a WPA network at work and WEP at home, and switching between them is pretty painless with networkmanager.
2006-10-17T14:31:00.000Z	canllaith		is anyone in here using edgy with a sony vaio ?
2006-10-17T14:31:00.000Z	jenda	canllaith	cool. I'm still worried about the driver on the card... but then again, I don't know yet if it works, so the worry might be unnecessary.
2006-10-17T14:31:00.000Z	canllaith	jenda	I bought an intel machine, makes life a lot easier.
2006-10-17T14:34:00.000Z	jenda	canllaith	I believe I have intel too. It's an Acer Aspire 1652
2006-10-17T14:34:00.000Z	jenda	canllaith	is there a way to find out for sure
2006-10-17T14:34:00.000Z	jenda		(I know the CPU is intel)
2006-10-17T14:35:00.000Z	canllaith	jenda	Do you have linux on it now? If so, lspci and read the output
2006-10-17T14:35:00.000Z	jenda	canllaith	yay. Network controller: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 2200BG Network Connection
2006-10-17T14:36:00.000Z	jenda		I only use linux.
2006-10-17T14:36:00.000Z	jenda		Only Ubuntu :)
2006-10-17T14:36:00.000Z	canllaith	jenda	Then you shouldn't have any problems :) The Intel stuff is very well supported. I have the 3945ABG and it's great.
