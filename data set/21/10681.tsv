2005-01-28T09:25:00.000Z	spiral	mjg59	just put the dmesg output...
2005-01-28T09:25:00.000Z	mjg59	spiral	Ah, that's you? Thanks
2005-01-28T09:25:00.000Z	spiral	mjg59	:-)
2005-01-28T09:26:00.000Z	mjg59	spiral	Can you add /var/log/dmesg as well?
2005-01-28T09:26:00.000Z	spiral	mjg59	allright :-)
2005-01-28T09:31:00.000Z	spiral	mjg59	done :-)
2005-01-28T09:34:00.000Z	mjg59	spiral	Ok, thanks. The lack of battery is due to it being a smart battery rather than a traditional one - with luck, we'll have that supported in Hoary
2005-01-28T09:39:00.000Z	mjg59	spiral	The speedstep bit is a bit harder.
2005-01-28T09:40:00.000Z	spiral	mjg59	sgnifff... And for the battery... Is that smart battery, when will there be a driver for it on hoary ?
2005-01-28T09:40:00.000Z	mjg59	spiral	Depending on how things go, possibly some time next week
2005-01-28T09:41:00.000Z	spiral	mjg59	all right for this one, so... Will apt-get -u dist-upgrading grab this automatically ?
2005-01-28T09:41:00.000Z	mjg59	spiral	Yes
2005-01-28T09:41:00.000Z	spiral	mjg59	nice for this one... And about speedstepping, have you got any idea why this doesn't work, or maybe sladen ?
2005-01-28T09:42:00.000Z	mjg59	spiral	sladen is the right person to talk to, but it's due to your ACPI tables not seeming to contain enough information
2005-01-28T09:42:00.000Z	spiral	mjg59	how should I do this ?
2005-01-28T09:43:00.000Z	spiral	mjg59	or fix these boring ACPI tables ?
2005-01-28T09:43:00.000Z	mjg59	spiral	sladen's probably the right person to talk to - I'm afraid I don't know too much about it
2005-01-28T10:41:00.000Z	spiral	mjg59	have you ?
2005-01-28T10:43:00.000Z	spiral	mjg59	is that right ? Do I have a "smart battery" ? Shall it be handled in ubuntu ?
2005-02-03T06:00:00.000Z	mjg59	spiral	The acpi-devel mailing list
2005-02-03T06:02:00.000Z	spiral	mjg59	I'm looking at it
