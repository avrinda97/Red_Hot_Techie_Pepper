2010-02-02T03:56:00.000Z	shawnboy		Do people use IRC as IM (meaning for just chatting, not about anything in particular)? If so, what server/room is used for that?
2010-02-02T03:56:00.000Z	rww	shawnboy	#defocus or #ubuntu-offtopic
2010-02-04T06:30:00.000Z	rww	shawnboy	no
2010-02-08T12:18:00.000Z	rww	shawnboy	which programming language?
2010-02-08T12:19:00.000Z	rww	shawnboy	#ubuntu-offtopic might be of more help
2010-07-26T09:52:00.000Z	rww	shawnboy	dhclient deals with resolv.conf using the information it gets from your dhcp server
2010-07-26T09:52:00.000Z	rww	shawnboy	and yes, if you're using /etc/network/interfaces you should remove network manager. It's not supposed to interfere, but it sometimes does.
2010-07-26T09:53:00.000Z	shawnboy	rww	remove, or can I simply disable somehow at first to make sure all works ok?
2010-07-26T09:57:00.000Z	rww	shawnboy	no idea about 1), but 2) would be "sudo apt-get purge network-manager" (and say yes if it complains that it has to remove network-manager-gnome)
2010-07-26T09:57:00.000Z	shawnboy	rww	point well taken, but still at least it's all setup in one place (my pfSense box which controls PS3 and several client PCs) as opposed to each of several clients.
2010-08-20T12:43:00.000Z	rww	shawnboy	seahorse-plugins adds the gedit plugin, iirc
2010-08-20T12:43:00.000Z	shawnboy	rww	oh. I didn't know that. thanks.
2010-08-20T12:43:00.000Z	rww	shawnboy	it used to be installed by default; there was some reason for changing that that I forget
2010-08-20T12:59:00.000Z	shawnboy	rww	just installed seahorse-plugins. That added encrypt/decrypt to file context menu in nautilus. Thanks again! I needed that.
2010-08-20T13:05:00.000Z	shawnboy	rww	Awesome, it enables me to add the "Clipboard Text Encryption" applet to the list of applets I can put on the panel, also. I really wanted that but thought it disappeared after jaunty.
2010-12-29T02:19:00.000Z	rww	shawnboy	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2010-12-29T02:20:00.000Z	shawnboy	rww	randomOfAmber , so is it gnome-desktop or ubuntu-desktop?
2010-12-31T15:28:00.000Z	rww	shawnboy	no
2010-12-31T15:28:00.000Z	shawnboy	rww	so what needs them uses them, otherwise no big deal having them installed and available?
2010-12-31T15:28:00.000Z	rww	shawnboy	correct
2010-12-31T15:28:00.000Z	shawnboy	rww	thank you very much.
