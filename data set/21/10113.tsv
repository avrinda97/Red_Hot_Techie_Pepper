2005-05-20T16:53:00.000Z	cirkit_		No what i wanted did not start at all
2005-05-20T16:55:00.000Z	cirkit_		ok
2005-05-20T16:57:00.000Z	cirkit_		ok
2005-05-20T05:55:00.000Z	cirkit_		I tried compiling gaim in ubuntu but it seems ubuntu is broken
2005-05-20T05:55:00.000Z	cirkit_		*** GTK+ 2.0 is required to build Gaim; please make sure you have the GTK+
2005-05-20T05:56:00.000Z	cirkit_		but there is a new version of gaim that ubuntu doesnt have yet
2005-05-20T05:56:00.000Z	cirkit_		i mean apt-get
2005-05-20T05:56:00.000Z	cirkit_		why doenst ubuntu have gtk?
2005-05-20T05:56:00.000Z	bob2	cirkit_	why do you want the new version?
2005-05-20T05:56:00.000Z	bob2	cirkit_	of course it has gtk, don't be silly
2005-05-20T05:57:00.000Z	bob2	cirkit_	it doesn't install every single development package by default, though, because that would be stupid
2005-05-20T05:57:00.000Z	bob2	cirkit_	you need to run 'sudo apt-get install build-essential ; sudo apt-get build-dep gaim'
2005-05-20T05:58:00.000Z	bob2	cirkit_	yes, run the command I gave you
2005-05-20T05:58:00.000Z	cirkit_	bob2	im running the build-dep gaim one
2005-05-20T05:58:00.000Z	bob2	cirkit_	no, run the command I gave you
2005-05-20T05:58:00.000Z	bob2	cirkit_	good
2005-05-20T06:00:00.000Z	bob2	cirkit_	think about it...how many potential sets of headers are there in ubuntu? hundreds, if not thousands.  installing them all would be silly.
2005-05-20T06:01:00.000Z	bob2	cirkit_	no, that's not what 'apt-get upgrade' does, please read the man page
2005-05-20T06:01:00.000Z	bob2	cirkit_	also, hoary is frozen, and will not be getting new versions of software
