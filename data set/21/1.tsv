2005-01-13T08:36:00.000Z	setite		fedora developers decided to take that out
2005-01-13T08:36:00.000Z	setite		f******
2005-01-13T08:36:00.000Z	setite		i doubt it
2005-01-13T08:36:00.000Z	setite		but it can read
2005-01-13T08:36:00.000Z	setite		so i dont have to redownload my mp3s

2005-01-13T08:37:00.000Z	setite		i was just guessing
2005-01-13T08:38:00.000Z	setite		why is ntfs writing such a taboo
2005-01-13T08:38:00.000Z	setite		cancel out the taboo word
2005-01-13T08:38:00.000Z	lifeless	setite	because its so easy to get wrong.
2005-01-13T08:38:00.000Z	setite		its taboo for the fedora folks
2005-01-13T08:38:00.000Z	lifeless	setite	the current code corrupts the ntfs database.
2005-01-13T08:38:00.000Z	setite		i dont know if it sucks.. but the people in its channel do
2005-01-13T08:39:00.000Z	setite		i didnt like having to redownload my mp3s
2005-01-13T08:39:00.000Z	setite		why
2005-01-13T08:39:00.000Z	setite	ubuntu	reads ntfs
2005-01-13T08:39:00.000Z	setite		no need
2005-01-13T08:39:00.000Z	lifeless		http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net/status.html
2005-01-13T08:39:00.000Z	setite		and having to figure out how to use yum just to get xmms-mp3
2005-01-13T08:39:00.000Z	lifeless	setite	also NT can read ext3
