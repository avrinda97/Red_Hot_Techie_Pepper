2007-08-01T09:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ashfire908	msttcorefonts are in one of the repos if you want those
2007-08-06T07:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ashfire908	are you using gparted or qtparted...  did you unmount the partition before trying this.. are you running livecd or working from an installed setup
2007-08-06T07:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ashfire908	Just unmount it after running gparted.
2007-11-27T05:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ashfire908	!enter
2007-11-27T05:34:00.000Z	Ashfire908	Jack_Sparrow	you have no sense of humor
2007-11-27T05:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ashfire908	NOne at all actually
2008-02-13T08:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ashfire908	Do you have untrusted people using shell accounts on your computer?
2008-02-13T08:22:00.000Z	Ashfire908	Jack_Sparrow	no, still though i don't want to download it for like a half an hour and slow my connection down just to have to download it all over again.
2008-02-13T08:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ashfire908	If you dont have untrusted people using shell accounts on your system then the exploit isnt an issue
2008-03-19T21:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ashfire908	you dont make a persistent livecd..   the usb stick makes it persistent
2008-03-19T21:21:00.000Z	Ashfire908	Jack_Sparrow	that's what i meant
2008-03-19T21:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ashfire908	see pendrivelinux
2008-03-20T19:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ashfire908	If you are trying to add unsupported repos, may I ask which ones and for what purpose
2008-03-20T19:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Ashfire908	gksudo gedit /apt/sources.list
