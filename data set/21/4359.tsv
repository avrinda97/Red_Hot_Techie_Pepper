2008-06-16T18:28:00.000Z	bullgard4		Midnight Commander shows for a certain directory, which I created myself, "User: root/root". How can I change this to "User: detlef/detlef"?
2008-06-16T18:30:00.000Z	ruiboon	bullgard4	sudo chown -r detlef:detlef /path/to/dir
2008-06-16T18:33:00.000Z	bullgard4	ruiboon	"detlef@MD97600:~$ sudo chown -r detlef:detlef ~/detlef2; [sudo] password for detlef: ***; chown: invalid option -- r"
2008-06-16T18:34:00.000Z	ruiboon	bullgard4	sorry. should be -R (that will change the owner and grp for the files/dir under that dir)
2008-06-16T18:36:00.000Z	bullgard4	ruiboon	Sorry. "detlef@MD97600:~$ sudo chown -R detlef:detlef ~/detlef2" But thereafter Midnight Commander still shows: "User: root/root".
2008-06-16T18:39:00.000Z	ruiboon	bullgard4	i am not sure about MC, but could you check the permission with terminal?
2008-06-16T18:45:00.000Z	bullgard4	ruiboon	"detlef@MD97600:~$ LC_ALL=C ls -al /home/detlef/detlef2/; total 28; drwxr-xr-x   3 detlef detlef  4096 Jun 16 11:15 .; drwxr-xr-x 131 detlef detlef  8192 Jun 16 15:10 ..; drwx------   2 detlef detlef 16384 Jun 16 11:15 lost+found"
2008-06-16T18:47:00.000Z	ruiboon	bullgard4	that output shows that is has been chown to ur user and group
2008-06-16T18:48:00.000Z	ruiboon	bullgard4	i am not sure how mc works, but could you reopen mc and check if it is still root?
2008-06-16T18:49:00.000Z	bullgard4	ruiboon	I closed mc. I reopened mc. Same result.
2008-06-16T18:52:00.000Z	ruiboon	bullgard4	could you try to recreate a new directory and check if it is still under root. if so, try changing it to your user. next check if terminal and mc display the correct user/grp
2008-06-16T18:54:00.000Z	bullgard4	ruiboon	How should I 'recreate' a new directory?
2008-06-16T18:54:00.000Z	ruiboon	bullgard4	create a new directory like how you created detlef2. the name of the dir doesnt matter
2008-06-16T18:55:00.000Z	bullgard4	ruiboon	I cannot do what you are asking me to do. I do not have available another empty partition.
2008-06-16T18:56:00.000Z	ruiboon	bullgard4	hang on, while i apt-get mc and try it
2008-06-16T19:07:00.000Z	ruiboon	bullgard4	i get it. /home/detlef/detlef2/ is a mount point. you will change the mount option, but i am not exactly sure on how to do it.
2008-06-16T19:09:00.000Z	bullgard4	ruiboon	A mount point. And a mount point is no file?
2008-06-16T19:11:00.000Z	ruiboon	bullgard4	lets put it this way. a mount point is a special directory that allows you to access another partition. (this is called drives in windows) normally, this is mounted at boot time so it the user is root
2008-06-16T19:13:00.000Z	bullgard4	ruiboon	Yes, I have configured this partition so that it mounts at boot time.
2008-06-16T19:42:00.000Z	ruiboon	bullgard4	what do you mean by 2 users? if is User: detlef/detlef ? The first one is your username and the second one is your group
2008-06-16T19:43:00.000Z	bullgard4	ruiboon	Yes, I meant 'detlef/detlef' in mc.  So you have given the explanation.
