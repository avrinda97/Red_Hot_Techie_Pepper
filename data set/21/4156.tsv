2010-11-20T09:01:00.000Z	mappum		how can i set my libraries I have recently installed (apt-get) to be included in g++?
2010-11-20T09:02:00.000Z	Skapare	mappum	"my libraries" are your own personal ones?  installed by what means?
2010-11-20T09:03:00.000Z	mappum	Skapare	ones I am assuming are standard such as zlib and pnglib, i used apt-get
2010-11-20T09:26:00.000Z	Skapare	mappum	normally that's done in the including source's #include directive
2010-11-20T09:27:00.000Z	Skapare	mappum	where did zlib.h get installed at?
2010-11-20T09:27:00.000Z	mappum	Skapare	i dont know, i used apt-get
2010-11-20T09:28:00.000Z	Skapare	mappum	do command:  ls -l /usr/include/zlib.h
2010-11-20T09:30:00.000Z	Skapare	mappum	install zlib-dev
2010-11-20T09:31:00.000Z	Skapare	mappum	hold on, let me check packages
2010-11-20T09:32:00.000Z	Skapare	mappum	try zlib1g-dev
2010-11-20T09:33:00.000Z	mappum	Skapare	thank you, it worked. I am just wondering, where did you go to find that?
2010-11-20T09:34:00.000Z	Skapare	mappum	I have a collection of files I generated by having aptitude get a package list then generate info on every package ... a four hour long run
2010-11-20T09:35:00.000Z	Skapare	mappum	unfortunately, the script uses some C programs I wrote, too ... so it's not ready for public use
2010-11-20T09:36:00.000Z	Skapare	mappum	eventually it will be
2010-11-20T09:36:00.000Z	mappum	Skapare	maybe it should be turned into a public service rather than a public script
2010-11-20T09:36:00.000Z	Skapare	mappum	that's an idea, too
2010-11-20T09:37:00.000Z	Skapare	mappum	not sure what the best WUI would be for it ... but I could just provide a tarball of all the data each week and let someone else do the web part
2010-11-20T09:38:00.000Z	Skapare	mappum	would be nice if ubuntu.com just did this ... that, afterall, have the master data
2010-11-20T09:38:00.000Z	Skapare	mappum	and that data downloads via apt-get update
2010-11-20T09:39:00.000Z	mappum	Skapare	have you contacted them? that would be pretty helpful to the community
2010-11-20T09:40:00.000Z	Skapare	mappum	as soon as I get lxc working right, I'll set up doing this for a few versions of ubuntu
