2012-04-15T11:23:00.000Z	manjrem	pawan_tejwani	so you are connting the usb dongle directly to the linux box and its not connecting ... is that it?
2012-04-15T11:23:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani	manjrem	the USB dongle is working fine but my home network (through router wired and wireless) is not connecting to internet, thought its working on windows
2012-04-15T11:25:00.000Z	manjrem	pawan_tejwani	what i am trying to know is if the dongle is connected to some router or is it directly connected to some machine
2012-04-15T11:25:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani	manjrem	its directly connected to ubuntu machine.
2012-04-15T11:28:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani	manjrem	what should i do so that it works fine... when I installed ubuntu it was working perfectly fine... I configured it via NetworkManager with manual IPs it worked fine then too but when I rebooted the system it now doesn't connect !
2012-04-15T11:37:00.000Z	manjrem	pawan_tejwani	what is your default gateway?
2012-04-15T11:38:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani	manjrem	routers IP address is the default gateway : 10.10.10.1
2012-04-15T11:39:00.000Z	manjrem	pawan_tejwani	check in network manager if your dns is configured
2012-04-15T11:39:00.000Z	manjrem	pawan_tejwani	also let me know the response for "ping 8.8.8.8"
2012-04-15T11:40:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani	manjrem	dns is configured in router itself so I put ip address same as routers in dns. and I have put openDNS ips in router for dns address.
2012-04-15T11:40:00.000Z	manjrem	pawan_tejwani	so what is the outcome of nslookup and ping?
2012-04-15T11:45:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani	manjrem	This is the output of ping its resolving the names to IPs but not able to exchange packets... tested with other sites also ... http://fpaste.org/Cubf/
2012-04-15T11:47:00.000Z	manjrem	pawan_tejwani	there is something wrong with the routing on your box ... please help me with the output of "route -n"
2012-04-15T11:51:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani	manjrem	http://paste.ubuntu.com/930656/
2012-04-15T11:51:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani	manjrem	I again and again have to disconnect from home router to connect to internet... :(
2012-04-15T11:55:00.000Z	manjrem	pawan_tejwani	10.10.10.0 is not a valid IP address for the netmask 255.255.255.0 ... changing the IP assigned to eth0 to may be 10.10.10.1 or something should do the trick
2012-04-15T11:56:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani	manjrem	I am trying that
2012-04-15T11:59:00.000Z	manjrem	pawan_tejwani	so its working now?
2012-04-15T11:59:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani	manjrem	no man I am pasting the configuration details for my home network, please check it out if I am wrong somewhere.
2012-04-15T12:01:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani	manjrem	where to paste screenshots ? I am not aware of !!! can you please let me know ?
2012-04-15T12:09:00.000Z	manjrem	pawan_tejwani	do it the same way you were doing it before
