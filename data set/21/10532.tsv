2005-02-11T11:41:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	I've had trouble getting it working, too.  Have you tried netapplet?
2005-02-11T11:42:00.000Z	steve	ficusplanet	where can I get it from
2005-02-11T11:43:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	You just need the newer wireless-tools and netapplet from Debian unstable.
2005-02-11T11:45:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	No, I just did dpkg -i filename1 filename 2
2005-02-11T11:46:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	here's a screenshot: http://www.thecardinal1978.com/GNOME/Screenshot.png
2005-02-11T11:48:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	Yeah, just a sec.
2005-02-11T11:50:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	just google for debian ubstable netapplet.  You need that package and wireless-tools 0.27
2005-02-11T12:02:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	Alright, I'll grab it really quick.
2005-02-11T12:03:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	np
2005-02-11T12:06:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	OK.  Head over to http://www.thecardinal1978.com/GNOME/debs/  Download both packages and install them with "sudo dpkg -i file1 file2"
2005-02-11T12:06:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	np
2005-02-11T12:10:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	you don't need to uncompress them.  You can just open a terminal and type "sudo dpkg -i" then drag each file into the terminal and press enter.
2005-02-11T12:33:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	sure.  But pm them to me.  Don't flood this channel.
2005-02-11T12:18:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	Drag the .deb files into the terminal.
2005-02-11T12:23:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	What error are you getting?
2005-02-11T12:24:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	it's -i not --i.  Sorry if I mistyped that.
2005-02-11T12:28:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	Gah.  Just a sec.
2005-02-11T12:32:00.000Z	ficusplanet	steve	OK, it's at http://www.thecardinal1978.com/GNOME/debs/
