2009-09-26T23:08:00.000Z	linked_		can anyone help me figure out why xserver won't let me click on anything in any window, but still switches workspaces fine, lets me type (but not key combo) in xchat, i can maximize/restore but not stretch or move this window
2009-09-26T23:09:00.000Z	linked_		sometimes, if i close all open windows, the next window i open will respond to clicks until i open a second window(or tab in firefox), then everything stops working
2009-09-26T23:10:00.000Z	n8bounds	linked_	is your window manager broken? can you see the maximize, minimize and close buttons?
2009-09-26T23:10:00.000Z	n8bounds	linked_	try running metacity --replace
2009-09-26T23:10:00.000Z	linked_	n8bounds	i see the buttons and all proper WM decorations
2009-09-26T23:10:00.000Z	linked_	n8bounds	it does this persistently after reboots
2009-09-26T23:11:00.000Z	n8bounds	linked_	are you using compiz, or no?
2009-09-26T23:12:00.000Z	linked_	n8bounds	yup
2009-09-26T23:12:00.000Z	n8bounds	linked_	try turning it off
2009-09-26T23:12:00.000Z	linked_	n8bounds	can i do that from tty0?
2009-09-26T23:12:00.000Z	n8bounds	linked_	killall compiz.real or something
2009-09-26T23:12:00.000Z	n8bounds	linked_	search through ps for compiz
2009-09-26T23:13:00.000Z	linked_	n8bounds	killall compiz.real worked
2009-09-26T23:14:00.000Z	n8bounds	linked_	can you hit ALT+F2 and get a command prompt? if so can you do the metacity --replace thing?
2009-09-26T23:16:00.000Z	n8bounds	linked_	do you have another user on this box? you could always add one from the tty, but i wonder if this isnt just some screwed up profile
2009-09-26T23:16:00.000Z	linked_	n8bounds	i'll try that, good idea
2009-09-26T23:16:00.000Z	n8bounds	linked_	okay, nevermind, its something worse
2009-09-26T23:17:00.000Z	n8bounds	linked_	what is this graphics card anyway? ohhh ur on a MAC
2009-09-26T23:17:00.000Z	n8bounds	linked_	is this the Intel graphics, nVidia or ATI
2009-09-26T23:20:00.000Z	n8bounds	linked_	try using the radeon or radeonhd drivers
2009-09-26T23:21:00.000Z	linked_	n8bounds	better performance from that, right?
