2008-06-28T21:59:00.000Z	Kidfork		 Im having a little trouble with Ubuntu, When i installed it inside-windows the instatlation worked perfectly, however, it installed fine, and i was able to log on once to Ubuntu. (im using the live cd version at the moment) BUt when i try to do it now it goes to the loading screen stops and i get a command line "Busy box v.1.3 Debain 1.1.1-5ubuntu12 Built in shell (Ash) Initramfs
2008-06-28T21:59:00.000Z	RAdams	Kidfork	your kernel isn't being loaded
2008-06-28T21:59:00.000Z	Kidfork	RAdams	How can i make it load?
2008-06-28T22:00:00.000Z	RAdams	Kidfork	did you opt out of installing grub when you installed ubuntu?
2008-06-28T22:01:00.000Z	Kidfork	RAdams	?
2008-06-28T22:01:00.000Z	RAdams	Kidfork	when you installed ubuntu, did you specifically tell it NOT to install GRUB?
2008-06-28T22:01:00.000Z	RAdams	Kidfork	if you don't know, the answer is most likely "no" :)
2008-06-28T22:03:00.000Z	Kidfork	RAdams	Well i installed it directly through WUBI so there was no option about that, i can still go back into windows, too bad its screwed up.
2008-06-28T22:04:00.000Z	RAdams	Kidfork	ok. so when you first start your computer, you have the option to pick between windows and ubuntu?
2008-06-28T22:06:00.000Z	Kidfork	RAdams	Correct
2008-06-28T22:07:00.000Z	RAdams	Kidfork	ok, can you send me your /boot/grub/menu.lst? i realize you can't boot into Ubuntu, one really quick way to grab it might be to install imaginary fs from www.fs-driver.org so you can mount your ext3 in Windows
2008-06-28T22:10:00.000Z	Kidfork	RAdams	Can i install Ubuntu and dual-boot with windows with WUBI?
2008-06-28T22:10:00.000Z	Kidfork	RAdams	Because i installed WUBI in Windows-Safemode
2008-06-28T22:11:00.000Z	RAdams	Kidfork	why in safe mode?
2008-06-28T22:11:00.000Z	Kidfork	RAdams	Idk why but one day i logged on WIndows and it was always crashing and lagging, but when i poped in the ubuntu live cd everything worked fine, thats why in safe mode
2008-06-28T22:12:00.000Z	RAdams	Kidfork	installing wubi in safe mode is not recommended
2008-06-28T22:12:00.000Z	Kidfork	RAdams	I didn't realy have much of a choice
2008-06-28T22:13:00.000Z	RAdams	Kidfork	might be time to reinstall and fix Windows then. Because installing it in safe mode is not likely to result in a workable environment
2008-06-28T22:14:00.000Z	Kidfork	RAdams	Any idea on how to reinstall windows without its disc
2008-06-28T22:14:00.000Z	RAdams	Kidfork	you can't.
2008-06-28T22:14:00.000Z	RAdams	Kidfork	unless you have some kind of recovery partition on your hard drive
