2009-09-24T11:08:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	what's the problem?
2009-09-24T11:08:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	trying to get your splashimage.xpm.gz to load in grub?
2009-09-24T11:09:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	actually you could use startupmanager to load it
2009-09-24T11:09:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	the file of your splashimage must be in /boot/grub, or atleast on your /boot partition
2009-09-24T11:10:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	actually it must be in /boot/grub/splashimages
2009-09-24T11:11:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	well my menu.lst has this line
2009-09-24T11:11:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	splashimage=/grub/splashimages/grub-splash-dark.xpm.gz
2009-09-24T11:11:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	no /boot in there, so take off /boot if you have it, just start from /grub
2009-09-24T11:15:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	/boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-09-24T11:16:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	then just add it
2009-09-24T11:16:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	splashimage=/grub/splashimages/grub-splash-dark.xpm.gz
2009-09-24T11:16:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	just rename it to your file
2009-09-24T11:18:00.000Z	jimbeam12	ewp	should i put that line on the start of the menu.lst
2009-09-24T11:19:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	i suggest anywhere before your OS list
2009-09-24T11:20:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	there should be a commented example for you in the file already
2009-09-24T11:39:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	any luck?
2009-09-24T11:42:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	well my splashimage file is located in /boot/grub/splashimages and here's a copy of my menu.lst. other than that idk what to tell ya :-P http://paste.ubuntu.com/276822/
2009-09-24T11:42:00.000Z	ewp	jimbeam12	yes startupmanager does suck but i use it for quick editing
