2010-08-14T11:18:00.000Z	rajatkhanduja	tanath	sry for the pasting
2010-08-14T11:18:00.000Z	rajatkhanduja	tanath	should I add it to fstab!
2010-08-14T11:19:00.000Z	tanath	rajatkhanduja	/dev/sda1 should be your root...
2010-08-14T11:19:00.000Z	rajatkhanduja	tanath	/dev/sda is the root ... I'm using a dual boot system. and /dev/sda1 refers to the Windows primary partition

2010-08-14T11:26:00.000Z	rajatkhanduja	tanath	isn't there any way to do it using the cmd line...just curious
2010-08-14T11:27:00.000Z	tanath	rajatkhanduja	of course. most prefer GUI though. you could configure things manually, but that way is faster
