2011-05-24T19:38:00.000Z	thegoodcushion		also, I want Windows to be the default now, not Ubuntu
2011-05-24T19:39:00.000Z	thegoodcushion		How do I make Windows the default one?
2011-05-24T19:40:00.000Z	Caboose885	thegoodcushion	you can install a tool via synaptic called "Startup-manager"
2011-05-24T19:40:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	Caboose885	thx
2011-05-24T19:42:00.000Z	Caboose885	thegoodcushion	I had a login keyring and I ended up deleting it because it was annoying. I have a user password and thats good enough for me
2011-05-24T19:43:00.000Z	Caboose885	thegoodcushion	brb switching to gnome
2011-05-24T19:45:00.000Z	Caboose885	thegoodcushion	It should be (under GNOME at least) System-->Preferences-->Passwords and Encryption keys
2011-05-24T19:46:00.000Z	Caboose885	thegoodcushion	you do know the passwords to connect back to the networks correct?
2011-05-24T19:46:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	Caboose885	Oh I still want it to be automatic
2011-05-24T19:47:00.000Z	Caboose885	thegoodcushion	it will be if you remove the "Passwords:login"
2011-05-24T19:47:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	Caboose885	okay, will try that
2011-05-24T19:47:00.000Z	Caboose885	thegoodcushion	but you will have to re-enter your passwords to the network once you delete the keys
2011-05-24T19:48:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	Caboose885	right, well that's not what I want
2011-05-24T19:48:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	Caboose885	What I did was that I changed my user account password just to keep it dynamic, and now I get an extra dialog telling me my login keyring password is different
2011-05-24T19:49:00.000Z	Caboose885	thegoodcushion	oh, right click on the Passwords:login folder and click change. It will prompt you for a new password :)
2011-05-24T19:55:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	Caboose885	that worked perfectly
2011-05-24T19:58:00.000Z	Caboose885	thegoodcushion	you can make custom menu entries under the /etc/grub.d/ directory
2011-05-24T19:58:00.000Z	Caboose885	thegoodcushion	it even has an empty 40_custom file waiting for you ;)
2011-05-24T19:58:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	Caboose885	Yes, I can
2011-05-24T20:07:00.000Z	Caboose885	thegoodcushion	what I did to customize grub and save time was copy the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file into the 40_custom file and made the changes from that.
2011-05-24T20:07:00.000Z	Caboose885	thegoodcushion	then run sudo update-grub and you should be good to go
