2010-10-08T07:56:00.000Z	szpuni	tomla4444	what you are looking for
2010-10-08T07:57:00.000Z	szpuni	tomla4444	this is not windows channel ;) but you can install ubuntu on raid 1 no problem
2010-10-08T07:58:00.000Z	szpuni	tomla4444	it depends what kind of raid you are looking for software or hardware
2010-10-08T08:01:00.000Z	szpuni	tomla4444	i don't know that software but you can use vmware or any any virtualisation tool but you will relay on windows for handeling drives
2010-10-08T08:06:00.000Z	szpuni	tomla4444	as far as i read this is software to run ubuntu with windows but i never see it
2010-10-08T08:06:00.000Z	szpuni	tomla4444	why don't you repartition your drive leave some space and install ubuntu as separate system?
2010-10-08T08:08:00.000Z	szpuni	tomla4444	yes it will only thing is you can see 2 drives apart of one
2010-10-08T08:08:00.000Z	szpuni	tomla4444	then you need to set up software raid1
2010-10-08T08:09:00.000Z	szpuni	tomla4444	in this case google will help you there is a lot of info
2010-10-08T08:10:00.000Z	szpuni	tomla4444	welcome in linux world ;)
2010-10-08T08:11:00.000Z	szpuni	tomla4444	it's not so hard it's acctally very simple
2010-10-08T08:12:00.000Z	szpuni	tomla4444	if you have hardware wich linux kernel support then no problem it will recognaize staight away
2010-10-08T08:15:00.000Z	szpuni	tomla4444	use livecd ;)
2010-10-08T08:15:00.000Z	szpuni	tomla4444	just type in google linux software raid and read
