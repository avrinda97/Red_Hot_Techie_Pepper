2008-10-11T12:16:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	five	Yes, I can with Hardy on x86_64 (amd64) with Firefox 3.0.3, OpenJDK and IceadTea
2008-10-11T12:17:00.000Z	five	IntuitiveNipple	the ninjavideo helper java applet?
2008-10-11T12:18:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	five	Yes, the helper applet in the pop-up window
2008-10-11T12:19:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	five	It took some time for the security dialog to appear
2008-10-11T12:26:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	five	No, believe it or not, I spend more time programming
2008-10-11T12:26:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	five	 Mine's mostly kernel code, and fixing bugs in various applications and packages. It's a never-ending quest for perfection :)
2008-10-11T12:29:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	five	How about running Windows in a virtual-machine guest? Then you can be uni-boot :)
2008-10-11T12:30:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	five	Because, Windows is accessible at the same time Ubuntu is running, and in a Window too
2008-10-11T12:36:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	five	The standard Hardy configuration of NetworkManager, wpa_supplicant, and network-manager-gnome shouldn't have any serious issues.
2008-10-11T12:38:00.000Z	five	IntuitiveNipple	yeah, im not really sure why it wont allow me to log on, im gonna talk to the IT guys at UA and see if they know what it is, if not then im gonna come back here and ask you guys for some help
2008-10-11T12:38:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	five	Try the latest NetworkManager 0.7 - it has vastly improved the support for those situations. I helped someone a couple weeks ago at Uni get connected to their secured uni network, was pretty easy.
2008-10-11T12:39:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	five	the NetworkManager PPA has the 0.7 versions for Hardy
