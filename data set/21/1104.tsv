2011-05-09T17:05:00.000Z	kyle___	ThinkT510	Yeh

2011-05-09T17:07:00.000Z	kyle___		basicly the images folder is default I want to exstend to another partion with way more space.
2011-05-09T17:07:00.000Z	kyle___		so I thought i could add a mount point.
2011-05-09T17:08:00.000Z	kyle___		They need to be there at boot?  soft links ok?
2011-05-09T17:08:00.000Z	kyle___		i'm adding the mount to the fstab file
2011-05-09T17:09:00.000Z	kyle___		/dev/sda3/images1/dataext3defaults00
2011-05-09T17:09:00.000Z	kyle___		with tabs
2011-05-09T17:10:00.000Z	kyle___		Dr_willis: did you see cmd line?
2011-05-09T17:11:00.000Z	kyle___		already mounted...
2011-05-09T17:11:00.000Z	kyle___		i can't see it. how do i clear mounts
2011-05-09T17:11:00.000Z	kyle___		mounts.
2011-05-09T17:14:00.000Z	ThinkT510	kyle___	hang on... /images1/data already has data in it and now you want to make that directory into a partition?
2011-05-09T17:15:00.000Z	kyle___		the partion is empty
2011-05-09T17:17:00.000Z	ThinkT510	kyle___	you said the images folder was default and you want to extend the space available to it by making it a seperate partition, yes?
