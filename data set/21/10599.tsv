2005-01-23T15:04:00.000Z	daniels		we are booting linux in about 30 seconds, on very slow laptop disks
2005-01-23T08:27:00.000Z	daniels		that bug's weird, and I haven't figured out how to trigger it or why it happens yet
2005-01-23T08:27:00.000Z	daniels		if there's nothing left, xorg should seize ownership
2005-01-23T08:27:00.000Z	daniels		if xfree86 purges and xorg is installed, it should hand over to xorg
2005-01-23T08:28:00.000Z	daniels		then again, those scripts are gargantuan and obtuse, so mere mortals have no hope of ever understanding how or why they work/don't work
2005-01-23T08:29:00.000Z	gomez	daniels	heh :)
2005-01-23T08:30:00.000Z	gomez	daniels	also, might be a silly question, but why is my desktop having refresh issues? is it a composite manager thing or something?
2005-01-23T08:30:00.000Z	daniels	gomez	define 'refresh issues'
2005-01-23T08:31:00.000Z	gomez	daniels	bakcground present but nautilus icons missing until mouse over
2005-01-23T08:31:00.000Z	daniels	gomez	ugh.  what chipset?
2005-01-23T08:31:00.000Z	gomez	daniels	also, everything is slow as hell
2005-01-23T08:32:00.000Z	gomez	daniels	TNT... also using 'nvidia' driver (don't hurt me!)
2005-01-23T08:33:00.000Z	gomez	daniels	as this is my first exposure to xorg, I'm not really aware of all the issues - I've read about a few but of course they didn't mean much to me at the time...
2005-01-23T08:33:00.000Z	gomez	daniels	disabling composite?
2005-01-23T08:35:00.000Z	daniels	gomez	composite is disabled by default
2005-01-23T08:36:00.000Z	gomez	daniels	I thought I remembered reading that. 'nv' works well btw
2005-01-23T08:36:00.000Z	gomez	daniels	(not surprisingly)
2005-01-23T08:39:00.000Z	daniels	gomez	heh, i blame the nvidia driver, then
2005-01-23T08:39:00.000Z	gomez	daniels	also, thanks for all your hard work
2005-01-23T08:39:00.000Z	gomez	daniels	hoary is looking very nice
2005-01-23T08:39:00.000Z	daniels	gomez	thanks a lot :) hoary is mostly done by Keybuk, it seems
