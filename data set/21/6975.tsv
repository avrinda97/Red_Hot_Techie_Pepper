2006-12-29T08:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		thats crazy
2006-12-29T08:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		it is.
2006-12-29T08:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		lol
2006-12-29T07:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		how do you check the installed system memory on an Ubuntu 6.10 machine?
2006-12-29T07:03:00.000Z	stefg	IndyGunFreak	choose the memtest86 option at boot
2006-12-29T07:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	stefg	what if memtest86 isn't one of my boot options?
2006-12-29T07:10:00.000Z	stefg	IndyGunFreak	then you don't have it ... :-) but never mind, it's just a memory test. i misunderstood your question: 'checking ram' is _testing_ for me, not finding the 'amount of free ram'
2007-07-12T15:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	stefg	bug ridden?.. hmm
2007-10-08T05:33:00.000Z	stefg	IndyGunFreak	doesn't know about ubotu. THAT'S blasphemy :-)
2007-10-08T05:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	stefg	lol
2007-10-08T05:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	stefg	whats wget -el?
2007-10-08T05:34:00.000Z	stefg	IndyGunFreak	man wget :-)
2007-11-04T18:12:00.000Z	stefg	IndyGunFreak	but newbs are more likely to screw up... so if they need a reinstall, they loose their settings
2007-11-04T18:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	stefg	i see the point... but if they hose up while partitioning, they're likely gonna bonk their windwos partition.. thus why i dont' recommend it.
2007-11-04T18:13:00.000Z	stefg	IndyGunFreak	gParted will take care of the 'mess up NTFS'-part anyway... :-)
2007-11-04T18:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	stefg	which is a problem in itself, i cant' get gparted to load on my desktop..lol, it loads fine on my laptop.. not sure what the issue is.. but i've got a live CD of it.
2007-11-04T18:18:00.000Z	stefg	IndyGunFreak	hildegard no longer true for gutsy. the version in the repos is outdated and has a severe security flaw
2008-01-20T18:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	stefg	thats awesome, hadnm't heard of that.... can you do that from the live CD?
2008-01-20T18:20:00.000Z	stefg	IndyGunFreak	only if you install that from Live environment (it's optional)...
2009-02-07T18:09:00.000Z	stefg	IndyGunFreak	GeffIsLegend ... wait, IndyGunFreak is right.... a wine-driveb game should be installed automatically to the emulated wine c:-drive in ~/.wine
