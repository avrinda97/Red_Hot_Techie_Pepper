2008-11-07T22:35:00.000Z	Cyde		Is there a nice GUI app for editing fstab, like how gparted is a nice GUI app for fdisk?
2008-11-07T22:37:00.000Z	ardchoille	Cyde	fstab is just a text file
2008-11-07T22:38:00.000Z	Cyde	ardchoille	Yes, I'm aware of what fstab is.
2008-11-07T22:38:00.000Z	Cyde	ardchoille	But editing fstab, especially to add a new drive, requires lots of consultation with the man page to get the options right.
2008-11-07T22:38:00.000Z	Cyde	ardchoille	A nice GUI app would make it easier to edit, especially for the average desktop user.
2008-11-07T22:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	Cyde	you have a good point, perhaps file a new item in brainstorm
2008-11-07T22:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	Cyde	I just did that yesterday
2008-11-07T22:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	Cyde	I used: /dev/sdb1       /mnt/sdb1       ext3    defaults,errors=remount-ro 0       2
2008-11-07T22:42:00.000Z	Cyde	ardchoille	Is it unimaginative that all of my HD mount points are /a, /b, and /z ?
2008-11-07T22:42:00.000Z	Cyde	ardchoille	Here's what I just used:   /dev/sdb1 /b auto nouser,atime,auto,rw,nodev,noexec,nosuid 0 0
2008-11-07T22:44:00.000Z	ardchoille	Cyde	ah, ok, well I just used the fstab entry for /dev/sda1 as a template for my /dev/sdb1
2008-11-07T22:44:00.000Z	Cyde	ardchoille	I went through the whole man page and assembled all of the options that I felt were appropriate.
2008-11-07T22:44:00.000Z	ardchoille	Cyde	good job
2008-11-07T22:44:00.000Z	Cyde	ardchoille	Would've been a lot nicer to just have a GUI with a bunch of checkboxes for each option and a description of what it does.
2008-11-07T22:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	Cyde	you should brainstorm that idea, it's nice
2008-11-07T22:45:00.000Z	Cyde	ardchoille	Well, I've been editing fstab since Red Hat 6, so it's not exactly foreign to me, but I figured there'd be a GUI by now.
2008-11-07T22:50:00.000Z	Cyde	ardchoille	Ooooh, look what I found:  http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/323/
2008-11-07T22:51:00.000Z	ardchoille	Cyde	nice find!
2008-11-07T22:51:00.000Z	Cyde	ardchoille	If you have a Brainstorm account, please vote it up.
2008-11-07T22:54:00.000Z	ardchoille	Cyde	will do
2008-11-07T22:55:00.000Z	ardchoille	Cyde	voted :) Thanks for the info
