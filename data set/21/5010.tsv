2008-01-14T12:54:00.000Z	radetsky		starting over again
2008-01-14T12:55:00.000Z	radetsky		I have a drive which won't mount and which will not allow me to fsck it, but smartctl reports that it is in OK health
2008-01-14T12:56:00.000Z	radetsky		it was working fine, then I unmounted it and turned it off, and when I turned it back on it wouldn't work
2008-01-14T12:56:00.000Z	radetsky		suggestions?
2008-01-14T12:56:00.000Z	radetsky		s/suggestions/suggestions please/
2008-01-14T12:57:00.000Z	webman	radetsky	pastebin the whole output from dmesg after you attempt to fsck the drive
2008-01-14T13:09:00.000Z	radetsky	webman	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/51874/
2008-01-14T13:16:00.000Z	webman	radetsky	so sdb is a usb flash disk or a usb HDD adaptor ?
2008-01-14T13:16:00.000Z	radetsky	webman	an external drive enclosure with an internal drive inside
2008-01-14T13:17:00.000Z	webman	radetsky	I would suggest try to install the HDD internally and see how it works
2008-01-14T13:19:00.000Z	radetsky	webman	ok, but I probably can't do it for a while
2008-01-14T13:21:00.000Z	webman	radetsky	I had a usbb enclosure do that to me once, it mostly worked, but never worked 100% after it started doing that..... but the drive would always work when connected internally
2008-01-14T13:23:00.000Z	radetsky	webman	wait, you mean that at first the drive did not do that, but then it started to do that?
2008-01-14T13:23:00.000Z	webman	radetsky	yes
2008-01-14T13:23:00.000Z	radetsky	webman	as in this is possibly symptomatic of mechanical failure of the enclosure?
2008-01-14T13:25:00.000Z	webman	radetsky	that is what I assumed in the end..... so I threw it out
2008-01-14T13:27:00.000Z	webman	radetsky	probably better to test it under windows before you complain about that one....
2008-01-14T13:28:00.000Z	radetsky	webman	as far as they'll know, I did ;)
2008-01-14T13:29:00.000Z	webman	radetsky	they will want "windows" error messages :).... anyway, it is also a good 'test' to ensure there is no linux driver problem/etc ....
2008-01-14T13:30:00.000Z	radetsky	webman	which do you think doesn't work under linux, usb or ide?
2008-01-14T13:31:00.000Z	webman	radetsky	well, I know usb works well under linux (usb-storage) but it could be some weird usb-storage problem with that device you have....
