2011-07-11T14:07:00.000Z	a|3x	iceroot	http://pastebin.com/96B0TVpi
2011-07-11T14:08:00.000Z	iceroot	a|3x	ok. you are only using offical repos + vbox-repo. did you run sudo apt-get update already?
2011-07-11T14:09:00.000Z	a|3x	iceroot	well the update manager popped up and i hit update
2011-07-11T14:10:00.000Z	a|3x	iceroot	i mean, i hit install updates
2011-07-11T14:10:00.000Z	iceroot	a|3x	ok please run "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
2011-07-11T14:10:00.000Z	iceroot	a|3x	if there are any errors please put them to pastebin
2011-07-11T14:11:00.000Z	a|3x	iceroot	i don't want to upgrade to 10.10
2011-07-11T14:12:00.000Z	a|3x	iceroot	by the way, i have software raid (mirroring for my 2 identical drives) and i have full disk encryption
2011-07-11T14:13:00.000Z	iceroot	a|3x	great :) that is the part i am doing at the moment with my system :) or better i am trying it
2011-07-11T14:13:00.000Z	a|3x	iceroot	well i did it using alternate ubuntu installer
2011-07-11T14:14:00.000Z	iceroot	a|3x	i am trying the step in an already running system
2011-07-11T14:18:00.000Z	a|3x	iceroot	hwq001, oh never mind, apparently my /boot ran out of space, when are they going to fix default /boot partition size?!!
2011-07-11T14:18:00.000Z	iceroot	a|3x	there is no reason to do that
2011-07-11T14:18:00.000Z	iceroot	a|3x	but 11.04 is not using /boot as extra partitoon anymore
2011-07-11T14:19:00.000Z	iceroot	a|3x	how about removing unsed kernels
2011-07-11T14:21:00.000Z	a|3x	iceroot	how are you going to boot and initialize your software raid and full disk encryption without a boot partition?
2011-07-11T14:22:00.000Z	iceroot	a|3x	that is the point i am asking myself at the moment
2011-07-11T14:22:00.000Z	iceroot	a|3x	i was very surprised ubuntu didnt create /boot
2011-07-11T14:23:00.000Z	iceroot	a|3x	as it seems i will reinstall and use the alternate-cd instead of fighting with this fresh instalation
