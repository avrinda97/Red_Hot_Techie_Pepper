2010-03-01T19:41:00.000Z	hl_99		hey there, i would like to test my hard drive very intensively. does anybody know some good test tools?
2010-03-01T19:42:00.000Z	solid_liquid	hl_99	you can use SMART for that
2010-03-01T19:43:00.000Z	hl_99		ok solid_liquid, how exactly can i do that?
2010-03-01T19:43:00.000Z	solid_liquid	hl_99	aptitude install smartmontools
2010-03-01T20:06:00.000Z	hl_99	solid_liquid	ok i got smartmontools after some trouble but it should be working. how can i perform an extensive test of my drive?
2010-03-01T20:07:00.000Z	solid_liquid	hl_99	man smartclt
2010-03-01T20:07:00.000Z	solid_liquid		er
2010-03-01T20:07:00.000Z	solid_liquid	hl_99	man smartctl
2010-03-01T20:10:00.000Z	hl_99		how can i figure out the "name" of my hard drive? i dont have write access btw
2010-03-01T20:14:00.000Z	hl_99	solid_liquid	i just get permission denied for smartctl -t long /dev/hdb and for other devices as well
2010-03-01T20:15:00.000Z	solid_liquid	hl_99	you have to run that as root
2010-03-01T20:15:00.000Z	solid_liquid	hl_99	so, prepend  sudo  to the command
2010-03-01T20:15:00.000Z	hl_99		ok i think it is running now
2010-03-01T20:16:00.000Z	hl_99		it says i need to wait for like 6 hours, i'd just like to see a log or results
2010-03-01T20:23:00.000Z	hl_99	solid_liquid	im curious if the test is really running, because my drive isnt making any noise and the hdd light isnt really indicating a lot of load
2010-03-01T20:24:00.000Z	solid_liquid	hl_99	yeah, that's normal
2010-03-01T20:25:00.000Z	solid_liquid	hl_99	it's strange how it works, but you won't notice any noises or lights coming from the drive, but the test is really running
2010-03-01T20:37:00.000Z	hl_99	solid_liquid	and when the test is complete i should get the results via        smartctl -l selftest /dev/sdb           right?
2010-03-01T20:38:00.000Z	solid_liquid	hl_99	yep
2010-03-01T20:38:00.000Z	hl_99	solid_liquid	ok thank you ; )
2010-03-01T20:39:00.000Z	solid_liquid	hl_99	np
