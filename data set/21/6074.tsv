2007-06-11T08:32:00.000Z	phantam1		is it nvidia-settings?
2007-06-11T08:33:00.000Z	Toma-	phantam1	the 'nvidia-settings' tool is by far the easiest way, if youre running the nvidia driver
2007-06-11T08:35:00.000Z	Toma-	phantam1	run 'glxinfo'
2007-06-11T08:40:00.000Z	Toma-	phantam1	its supported. im using it right here
2007-06-11T08:41:00.000Z	Toma-	phantam1	having a look at your poastebin. 1 moment
2007-06-11T08:42:00.000Z	Toma-	phantam1	right youre not using the nvidia driver at this moment. can you please put a copy of xorg.conf up on pastebin?
2007-06-11T08:46:00.000Z	Toma-	phantam1	yeh youre still using the nv driver.
2007-06-11T08:47:00.000Z	Toma-	phantam1	the nv driver = 2d driver
2007-06-11T08:49:00.000Z	Toma-	phantam1	thats because youre not usng the nvidia driver
2007-06-11T08:49:00.000Z	Toma-	phantam1	yep
2007-06-11T08:54:00.000Z	phantam1	Toma-	ok nvidia-glx is installed... now what... log out and log back in?
2007-06-11T08:55:00.000Z	Toma-	phantam1	yeh restart X... easiest way it to log out, then at the GDM screen, hit Clt-Alt-Backspace then log in
