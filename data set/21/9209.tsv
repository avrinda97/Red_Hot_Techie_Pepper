2005-10-26T10:34:00.000Z	notChankster		Ive got a question about mounting a NTFS drive to be writeable
2005-10-26T10:35:00.000Z	notChankster		basically I'm trying to remove some files on a drive because windows wont let me remove them
2005-10-26T10:36:00.000Z	sizzam	notChankster	 like said above, its experimental and extremely dangerous, but here's a page to check out:   http://www.jankratochvil.net/project/captive/
2005-10-26T10:37:00.000Z	notChankster		Sizzam: so if i shouldnt do it, do you have an idea of how to remove a file that windows wont let me delete?
2005-10-26T10:37:00.000Z	notChankster	sizzam	ive already tried booting into safe mode
2005-10-26T10:37:00.000Z	sizzam	notChankster	  can you delete it in Windows Safe Mode?
2005-10-26T10:37:00.000Z	sizzam		lol
2005-10-26T10:37:00.000Z	notChankster		beat ya
2005-10-26T10:37:00.000Z	sizzam	notChankster	 is it possible that a windows process is holding onto it, even in safe mode?
2005-10-26T10:38:00.000Z	notChankster	sizzam	its possible but I cant find any process threads attached to those files
2005-10-26T10:38:00.000Z	sizzam	notChankster	 is it in your /temp folder or anything like that
2005-10-26T10:39:00.000Z	notChankster	sizzam	No, one file is on my desktop, the other files are on a different partition
2005-10-26T10:39:00.000Z	sizzam		hmm
2005-10-26T10:39:00.000Z	sizzam		whats the extension on the file
2005-10-26T10:39:00.000Z	notChankster	sizzam	one is a .exe another a .dll
2005-10-26T10:40:00.000Z	sizzam	notChankster	 that leads me to believe that it may be in use
2005-10-26T10:41:00.000Z	sizzam	notChankster	 will it let you drag it into another folder or anything
2005-10-26T10:41:00.000Z	notChankster	sizzam	No
2005-10-26T10:41:00.000Z	notChankster	sizzam	i'll brb going to try something
2005-10-26T10:42:00.000Z	sizzam	notChankster	 unless you can narrow down an app loading at startup, maybe via msconfig,  you might be looking at using the recovery console
