2009-09-05T09:48:00.000Z	LucidGuy		incase anyone is interested .. I have giving the toshiba nb200 netbook a good run for its money with ubuntu and overall Im not happy and will be returning it.
2009-09-05T09:48:00.000Z	shiki-	LucidGuy	whats wrong with it?
2009-09-05T09:49:00.000Z	LucidGuy	shiki-	 I hate the sound quality of the speakers.  The return key drives me nuts.  And its way too much work to even get the speakers/sound to work in general.  Ohh and the battery life is horrible.
2009-09-05T09:50:00.000Z	shiki-	LucidGuy	why do you use Ubuntu on it in the first place?..ehhh
2009-09-05T09:50:00.000Z	LucidGuy	shiki-	 was that a serious question?
2009-09-05T09:50:00.000Z	shiki-	LucidGuy	of course
2009-09-05T09:51:00.000Z	LucidGuy	shiki-	because I prefer linux over windows
2009-09-05T09:51:00.000Z	LucidGuy	shiki-	 Do you honestly believe there is a distro out there that will properly support that netbooks hardware better then UNR?
2009-09-05T09:51:00.000Z	shiki-	LucidGuy	why not?
2009-09-05T09:52:00.000Z	shiki-	LucidGuy	even if there is no *buntu in the name, it should work
2009-09-05T09:52:00.000Z	LucidGuy	shiki-	 you have an nb200?
2009-09-05T09:52:00.000Z	LucidGuy	shiki-	huh?
2009-09-05T09:53:00.000Z	shiki-	LucidGuy	its a sound system like Alsa+Pulseaudio. JUst eats less, knows more, works better.. (just supports less hardware).
2009-09-05T09:54:00.000Z	LucidGuy	shiki-	 ..ohh thought you were refering to OSS as in a distro.  I got all the hardware to work on the nb200 .. and yes you have to use OSS4 on it.
2009-09-05T09:54:00.000Z	shiki-	LucidGuy	ah.. so? whats wrong with sound now? OSS should work on it
2009-09-05T09:54:00.000Z	LucidGuy	shiki-	 but then I went to karmic and performed the same steps to get oss up and running etc .. and urg never worked like intrepid or jaunty
2009-09-05T09:55:00.000Z	shiki-	LucidGuy	why would you use a not-yet-complete distro?
2009-09-05T09:55:00.000Z	LucidGuy	shiki-	 I was hopeing that it would support the sound/wifi better then jaunty did without the annoying steps to patch.
2009-09-05T09:56:00.000Z	LucidGuy	shiki-	do you have an nb200?  and if so what os/distro do you have running on it?
2009-09-05T09:56:00.000Z	shiki-	LucidGuy	well.. in such cases, you should just try to use other distro.
2009-09-05T09:57:00.000Z	LucidGuy	shiki-	how similiar 100,200,2005? .. and did all the hardware work out of the box?
