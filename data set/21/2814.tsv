2009-06-12T21:29:00.000Z	newUbux		my Ubuntu doesn't have sound anymore after I got my wireless working? did I block out something that might've affected the sound performance?
2009-06-12T21:30:00.000Z	newUbux		does anyone know why my sound went away?
2009-06-12T21:32:00.000Z	newUbux		why don't I have sound?
2009-06-12T21:34:00.000Z	newUbux		i have no sound? what happened?
2009-06-12T21:34:00.000Z	SeanJM	newUbux	did sound suddenly stop working? or never worked?
2009-06-12T21:35:00.000Z	SeanJM	newUbux	did you go to System->Preferences->Sound?
2009-06-12T21:37:00.000Z	SeanJM	newUbux	okay, click test on the 1st one okay?
2009-06-12T21:39:00.000Z	SeanJM	newUbux	that is fine. Try that drop down menu there, and switch the selection to another sound driver
2009-06-12T21:39:00.000Z	SeanJM	newUbux	then click test again
2009-06-12T21:40:00.000Z	SeanJM	newUbux	untill you get to a driver that works, it wont take long
2009-06-12T21:41:00.000Z	SeanJM	newUbux	yes, it will produce a medium pitch tone
2009-06-12T21:42:00.000Z	SeanJM	newUbux	out of none of them?
2009-06-12T21:42:00.000Z	newUbux	SeanJM	none of them works
2009-06-12T21:43:00.000Z	SeanJM	newUbux	that is not good.
2009-06-12T21:43:00.000Z	newUbux	SeanJM	ok. i was trying to get the wireless connection working. and i did! but now the sound is gone
2009-06-12T21:44:00.000Z	SeanJM	newUbux	oh, so you had switchy switchy happen eh
2009-06-12T21:44:00.000Z	newUbux	SeanJM	is there any chance i might've blacklisted something i shouldn't have?
2009-06-12T21:44:00.000Z	SeanJM	newUbux	Possibly, I do not know how to help you with that issue--funny enough I am having a sound issue myself.
