2006-11-02T13:32:00.000Z	RawSewage		what do I use to encode mp3 to ogg?  lame or liblame0
2006-11-02T13:32:00.000Z	savvas	RawSewage	i use soundkonverter, it works pretty good in gnome desktop too
2006-11-02T13:33:00.000Z	RawSewage	savvas	I tried it, but when I click STart, nothing happens
2006-11-02T13:34:00.000Z	savvas	RawSewage	in simple or detailed mode?
2006-11-02T13:35:00.000Z	RawSewage	savvas	idk.  I'll install it again and check
2006-11-02T13:37:00.000Z	savvas	RawSewage	install it with: sudo apt-get install soundkonverter vorbis-tools
2006-11-02T13:37:00.000Z	RawSewage	savvas	ok
2006-11-02T13:37:00.000Z	savvas	RawSewage	sorry, lame too: sudo apt-get install soundkonverter vorbis-tools lame
2006-11-02T13:40:00.000Z	RawSewage	savvas	do I need to restart x?
2006-11-02T13:40:00.000Z	savvas	RawSewage	no why?
2006-11-02T13:40:00.000Z	RawSewage	savvas	still nothing happening
2006-11-02T13:41:00.000Z	RawSewage	savvas	maybe it has to do with Edgy
2006-11-02T13:41:00.000Z	savvas	RawSewage	ok, tell me what you do
2006-11-02T13:41:00.000Z	RawSewage	savvas	I add files.  I set it to encode to ogg level 100.  I click STart...  and all files just say  Waiting...  but nothing is happening
2006-11-02T13:42:00.000Z	savvas	RawSewage	in simple mode or detailed mode?
2006-11-02T13:43:00.000Z	RawSewage	savvas	oh, ok.  I guess Simple mode is broken.  Detailed mode is working
2006-11-02T13:44:00.000Z	RawSewage	savvas	oh, maybe what I did was not set anything in Simple mode.  probably my fault
2006-11-02T13:44:00.000Z	RawSewage	savvas	I went to Detailed to set the Ogg qualtiy, then went back to Simple
2006-11-02T13:44:00.000Z	RawSewage	savvas	my fault
2006-11-02T13:45:00.000Z	savvas	RawSewage	hehe, ok, simple mode works too though
2006-11-02T13:45:00.000Z	RawSewage	savvas	ok
