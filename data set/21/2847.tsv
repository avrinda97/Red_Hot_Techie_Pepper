2009-06-19T09:28:00.000Z	InfoMoMo		Hey guys! Where would I copy an application if i want to run it? /usr/bin/, /bin/, /sbin/ ? Thanks in advance
2009-06-19T09:29:00.000Z	ectospasm	InfoMoMo	don't put it anywhere unless you want it to be system wide, just leave it in your home directory
2009-06-19T09:29:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	ectospasm	system wide yes, i would like to run it from anywhere
2009-06-19T09:29:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	ectospasm	it is a VOIP soft phone.
2009-06-19T09:29:00.000Z	ectospasm	InfoMoMo	so, put it in /home/user/bin and add that to your permanent PATH in .bashrc
2009-06-19T09:29:00.000Z	InfoMoMo		thnaks
2009-06-19T09:30:00.000Z	ectospasm	InfoMoMo	or, install it to /usr/local/bin
2009-06-19T09:30:00.000Z	ectospasm	InfoMoMo	the install script should handle that part, though
2009-06-19T09:31:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	ectospasm	it does not install, just runs
2009-06-19T09:31:00.000Z	ectospasm	InfoMoMo	sounds like a poorly designed package, IMO
2009-06-19T09:31:00.000Z	ectospasm	InfoMoMo	what softphone is this?
2009-06-19T09:33:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	ectospasm	http://storage.counterpath.com/downloads/X-Lite_Install.tar.gz?platform=linux&product=xlite
2009-06-19T09:33:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	ectospasm	X-Lite
2009-06-19T09:34:00.000Z	ectospasm	InfoMoMo	XLite didn't work for me the last time I tried it.  You may want to run it in place before you copy it to your system folders
2009-06-19T09:35:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	ectospasm	it usually works for me on my systems
2009-06-19T09:36:00.000Z	ectospasm	InfoMoMo	IIRC X-lite is no longer being maintained, so good luck!
2009-06-19T09:36:00.000Z	ectospasm		...at least the Linux port isn't
2009-06-19T09:36:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	ectospasm	IIRC ?
2009-06-19T09:36:00.000Z	ectospasm	InfoMoMo	If I Remember Correctly
2009-06-19T09:38:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	ectospasm	sure is, v4 is coming out :D
2009-06-19T09:39:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	ectospasm	and by the way, it is one of the softphones that works out of the box with sipxecs
