2012-08-29T00:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	powerplay	try running:  source ~/.bashrc
2012-08-29T00:32:00.000Z	powerplay	ActionParsnip	that wierd because right now everything is listen in same white color as of now
2012-08-29T00:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	powerplay	try the command I gave
2012-08-29T00:33:00.000Z	powerplay	ActionParsnip	wow it worked! many thanks, could u give me more details on what the command does
2012-08-29T00:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	powerplay	it runs the commands that configure the shell properly, you don't have a ~/.profile file
2012-08-29T00:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	powerplay	run:  sudo cp /root/.profile $HOME; sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.profile       and it will be fine
2012-08-29T00:34:00.000Z	powerplay	ActionParsnip	awseome, and what do i do if i want to change up the colors?
2012-08-29T00:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	powerplay	not sure of the actual colour change but the default bash ones are used
2012-08-29T00:36:00.000Z	powerplay	ActionParsnip	alright thanks a lot for your help again!!!
2012-08-29T01:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	powerplay	what if you run:  source ~/.bashrc
2012-08-29T01:29:00.000Z	powerplay	ActionParsnip	ya but i have to run that everytime i open up the terminal
2012-08-29T01:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	powerplay	then run:  sudo cd /root/.profile $HOME; sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.profile
2012-08-29T01:30:00.000Z	powerplay	ActionParsnip	im just trying to figure out whats going on under the hood
2012-08-29T01:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	powerplay	and it will run in each terminal automagically
2012-08-29T01:30:00.000Z	powerplay	ActionParsnip	does that command create a new profile?
2012-08-29T01:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	powerplay	just the file ~/.profile
2012-08-29T01:31:00.000Z	powerplay	ActionParsnip	I see so what happens under the hood after executing that command, is the terminal condigured to read from bashrc everytime i open it?
2012-08-29T01:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	powerplay	yes, the .profile file makes it happens, sounds like yours is different
