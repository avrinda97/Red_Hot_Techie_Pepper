2007-10-22T06:25:00.000Z	danny3793		is there anything i can do to keep this darn LiveCD for 7.10 from crashing?? even starting with safe gfx does not work
2007-10-22T06:25:00.000Z	danny3793		it starts up and after like 10 seconds it freezes and theres random colors around the screen in horizontal lines, so i know its a video problem, can someone help me disable whatever is causing this?
2007-10-22T06:26:00.000Z	nexano	danny3793	whats your video card?
2007-10-22T06:26:00.000Z	danny3793	nexano	Nvidia, integrated graphics, let me find you the exact type
2007-10-22T06:26:00.000Z	nexano	danny3793	dont bother
2007-10-22T06:27:00.000Z	nexano	danny3793	try ctrl+alt+f1 and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-10-22T06:27:00.000Z	danny3793	nexano	sure thing if i can do it before it freezes
2007-10-22T06:28:00.000Z	nexano	danny3793	check private
2007-10-22T06:28:00.000Z	nexano	danny3793	it most likely doesnt freeze, it just screws up, had the same problem ehre
2007-10-22T06:34:00.000Z	danny3793	nexano	does it save these values?? like if i restart will these values be saved?
2007-10-22T06:35:00.000Z	nexano	danny3793	if youre referring to the dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg values yes
2007-10-22T06:35:00.000Z	nexano	danny3793	they require you to restart :P
2007-10-22T06:35:00.000Z	danny3793	nexano	how do i restart from this prompt thing?
2007-10-22T06:35:00.000Z	nexano	danny3793	well, either do a ctrl-alt-F1 when the screens fucks up, or start in recovery mode i suppose
2007-10-22T06:45:00.000Z	danny3793	nexano	you still here?
2007-10-22T06:47:00.000Z	danny3793	nexano	I tried what you said and it still is freezing, infact it forze first time i logged int
2007-10-22T07:49:00.000Z	danny3793	nexano	yeah? lol
2007-10-22T07:49:00.000Z	nexano	danny3793	i havent been paying attention here, but are you having trouble booting from the livecd?
2007-10-22T07:50:00.000Z	danny3793	nexano	i can get in, but it freezes almost instantly, i think its a video error
2007-10-22T07:53:00.000Z	danny3793	nexano	i found a topic earlier discussing that, the dude suggested to just use the restricted drivers, but one person used Envy and it worked for them
2007-10-22T11:00:00.000Z	nexano	danny3793	still here?
