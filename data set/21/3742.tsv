2011-06-28T07:50:00.000Z	morth		me too hehe
2011-06-28T07:51:00.000Z	morth		guys, i have a problem.
2011-06-28T07:51:00.000Z	morth		/dev/loop0 says available 14.4gb and /dev/sda3 (/host) shows 51.7gb
2011-06-28T07:51:00.000Z	morth		how do i make it so i can use that 51gb?
2011-06-28T07:52:00.000Z	morth		because when im trying to install my game it says im running out of space
2011-06-28T07:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morth	run:  ln -s /host ~/Windows\ Files             and you can save stuff on your NTFS partition
2011-06-28T07:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morth	run the command I gave in a terminal and you will get a new folder in $HOME  when you save stuff in there it will go onto your NTFS files
2011-06-28T07:57:00.000Z	morth	ActionParsnip	i just typed in " ln -s /host ~/Windows\ Files" and it didn't do anything.. atleast i dont think it did
2011-06-28T07:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morth	open your home folder ;)
2011-06-28T08:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morth	it made a link which is like a windows shortcut but a tonne more powerful. It just makes things easier when you want to access your windows data
2011-06-28T08:01:00.000Z	morth	ActionParsnip	will it let me use my files? ie- i want to play a game from my windows partiton will Wine let me? - i was going to just copy the folder over to Ubuntu.. :s
2011-06-28T08:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morth	you can also write data there too so you can save your goat porn/justin beiber MP3s/glee episodes to your windows files and use that space
2011-06-28T08:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morth	games will not work, you will need to install them in wine
2011-06-28T08:02:00.000Z	morth	ActionParsnip	sweet, because i have alot of goatporn.
2011-06-28T08:03:00.000Z	morth	ActionParsnip	well how can i install games with/to wine?
2011-06-28T08:03:00.000Z	morth	ActionParsnip	i can just use the folder we've created?
2011-06-28T08:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morth	you will need to run the installer, then more the ~/.wine folder to the ntfs partition, the symlink the .wine folder so that it looks like it is stored in the original place but its merely a link
2011-06-28T08:35:00.000Z	morth	ActionParsnip	i have got it working thank you, i just copied my Game folder into the folder we've created it booted up properly im running around ingame zero lag.
2011-06-28T11:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morth	I chat and web browse, ubuntu does that, why pay for an OS?
2011-06-28T11:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morth	you'll learn with time
