2012-11-22T20:02:00.000Z	ccsteale	p0rk	let me know how it goes :)
2012-11-22T19:42:00.000Z	ccsteale	p0rk	does running fdisk -l or parted -l show anything useful?
2012-11-22T19:43:00.000Z	ccsteale	p0rk	anything obvious in dmesg?
2012-11-22T19:44:00.000Z	p0rk	ccsteale	hang on gotta boot back up and check
2012-11-22T19:46:00.000Z	ccsteale	p0rk	seems like boot config is messed up to be honest, can you mount /dev/sda5 to /mnt and run grub-update or grub-install?
2012-11-22T19:47:00.000Z	p0rk	ccsteale	thats actually what ive been trying, but when i boot to a livecd or anything else, there are no sd* devices in /dev/
2012-11-22T19:48:00.000Z	ccsteale	p0rk	is this in a laptop/desktop/server? id advise pulling the drive our and back in and checking what dmesg as to say to see if it picks the drives up and if it does it seems like its going to be a driver issue, most likley no support from the kernel for the drives which is why it drops back to grub shell
2012-11-22T19:49:00.000Z	p0rk	ccsteale	ok, ill take a look. i had lost a drive last week nad just tossed in an old 2.5" to tinker with
2012-11-22T19:55:00.000Z	p0rk	ccsteale	booted into system rescue cd, now i can see the drive at least
2012-11-22T20:20:00.000Z	p0rk	ccsteale	im trying to do a grub-install but it says "Probing devices to guess BIOS drives. This may take a long time."
2012-11-22T20:21:00.000Z	ccsteale	p0rk	run - grub-install /dev/sda that should be done within the minute see if that works
2012-11-22T20:23:00.000Z	ccsteale	p0rk	sounds like the device map might be foobarred
2012-11-22T20:23:00.000Z	ccsteale	p0rk	mount your boot partitions to /boot and run
2012-11-22T20:23:00.000Z	ccsteale	p0rk	grub-mkdevicemap --device-map=/boot/grub/device.map
2012-11-22T20:23:00.000Z	ccsteale	p0rk	things should be fine to run grub install then
2012-11-22T20:27:00.000Z	ccsteale	p0rk	could always try doing that, it would most likley fix the issue, but i hate being defeated by a bad install :P one last effort  - try grub-update /dev/sda
2012-11-22T20:36:00.000Z	p0rk	ccsteale	this is only a test case anyway until i get new drives where i have to reinstall everything again
2012-11-22T21:47:00.000Z	p0rk	ccsteale	i tried the 12.10 install on 2 different drives and got the same error, installation failed at the install the system step
2012-11-22T21:49:00.000Z	ccsteale	p0rk	might be lack of driver support in the 12.10 kernel, let me know if it works on 12.04 and let me know you drive types later and ill take a look at that
2012-11-22T21:59:00.000Z	p0rk	ccsteale	looks like the 12.04 install worked fine
2012-11-22T22:09:00.000Z	p0rk	ccsteale	rebooting into os for first time
