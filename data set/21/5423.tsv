2007-11-25T13:29:00.000Z	MooCows		Hello, I was thinking about setting up a dual boot , I have 2 partitions on this HD right now, one is a small 10 GB partition
2007-11-25T13:29:00.000Z	MooCows		Would that be good enough to install Ubuntu for testing
2007-11-25T13:31:00.000Z	MooCows		Also, how would I set it up to dual boot?
2007-11-25T13:31:00.000Z	MooCows		So that it doesn't damange the windows side
2007-11-25T13:32:00.000Z	rhs	MooCows	yes
2007-11-25T13:33:00.000Z	MooCows		So I don't have to do any fancy stuff with lilo (Or whatever) ?  I had to do a bunch of junk back in Mandrake for lilo to work out when I was dual booting Win98SE
2007-11-25T13:34:00.000Z	rhs	MooCows	ubuntu installs grub (which replaces lilo) automatically
2007-11-25T13:35:00.000Z	MooCows		OK , so pretty much all I should have to do is move the data off the other parition, go and install Ubuntu on the smaller partition , and make sure it's going to use it, and I should be fine for booting XP AND Ubuntu ?
2007-11-25T13:36:00.000Z	rhs	MooCows	read the documentation first for installing, and at installation choose to partition manually
2007-11-25T13:36:00.000Z	rhs	MooCows	I'm going to find some doc for you
2007-11-25T13:40:00.000Z	rhs	MooCows	there's the problem of the MBR
2007-11-25T13:48:00.000Z	rhs	MooCows	do you need more help ?
2007-11-25T13:48:00.000Z	MooCows	rhs	what problem of the MBR
2007-11-25T13:49:00.000Z	MooCows		The MBR in windows ?
2007-11-25T13:49:00.000Z	rhs	MooCows	once grub is installed, you will always have a menu at startup, unless you reinstall windows
2007-11-25T13:50:00.000Z	MooCows	rhs	that's what I want.  Or are you talking about if I was to format the parition which Ubuntu would be installing to, I STILL would have the grub menu ?
2007-11-25T13:51:00.000Z	rhs	MooCows	you would still have the menu, there's a workaround but it's complicated
2007-11-25T13:51:00.000Z	rhs	MooCows	http://www.matthewjmiller.net/howtos/dual-boot-linux-and-windows/
2007-11-25T13:51:00.000Z	MooCows	rhs	OK, so What are you talking about "The problem" ?
2007-11-25T13:53:00.000Z	rhs	MooCows	hum, i made a mistake
2007-11-25T13:54:00.000Z	rhs	MooCows	no the menu whouldn't be here and you coulndn't boot your windows
