2008-09-26T17:07:00.000Z	gharz		guys, i've 1 server and how do i connect to it? in windows i ican connect to it using putty.exe... sshs connection... any application that does the same way in ubuntu?
2008-09-26T17:07:00.000Z	cfm	gharz	type ssh
2008-09-26T17:11:00.000Z	gharz	cfm	sorry i'm not sure how it works... do i have to type in ssh 192.168.254.13? the port is 22.
2008-09-26T17:11:00.000Z	gharz	cfm	ssh 192.168.254.13 doesn't connect and no result shows
2008-09-26T17:20:00.000Z	cfm	gharz	Sorry, afk.  ssh then the ip or DNS name should work.  If it's not, check are you running ssh daemon on different port than 22?
2008-09-26T17:24:00.000Z	gharz	cfm	let me check on it.
2008-09-26T17:24:00.000Z	gharz	cfm	thanks!
2008-09-26T17:32:00.000Z	gharz	cfm	if i run ssh server.host.name... i'm getting Name or service not known
2008-09-26T17:33:00.000Z	cfm	gharz	Can you ping the host?  You say you can get into this box in Putty alright?
2008-09-26T17:35:00.000Z	gharz	cfm	yes. i can get into it using putty.exe
2008-09-26T17:40:00.000Z	cfm	gharz	I'm afraid I'm not sure what the problem is then - Putty and ssh should be behaving the same!  Try a "ssh -v -v -v hostname" and see if the debug info gives you any more hints.
2008-09-26T17:40:00.000Z	gharz	cfm	tripe -v?
2008-09-26T17:40:00.000Z	cfm	gharz	Yes, it increases debug up to a max of three.
2008-09-26T17:41:00.000Z	gharz	cfm	debug1: Reaing config data /etc/ssh/ssh_config debug1: Apllying options for * debug2: ssh_connect: needpriv 0
2008-09-26T17:42:00.000Z	gharz	cfm	ssh glark.yaqoub.lan: Name or service not known
2008-09-26T17:43:00.000Z	cfm	gharz	It's really not resolving that name.  You're sure a "ping hostname" from the same box - same shell - works?
2008-09-26T17:43:00.000Z	cfm	gharz	Okay, try a ssh -v -v -v 192.168.254.13
2008-09-26T17:47:00.000Z	gharz	cfm	just 1 last question? how do i log in? do i just type ssh? or ssh IPAddress? ssh hostname?
2008-09-26T17:47:00.000Z	gharz	cfm	then i'll start from there
2008-09-26T17:48:00.000Z	cfm	gharz	ssh will give you a username prompt unless you pass -lmyusername to it, it will prompt for a password unless you're using a certificate.  Get past that are you're in a shell.
2008-09-26T17:48:00.000Z	cfm	gharz	and ssh will take either hostname or ip address - either is good.  Will ask you to confirm fingerprint on first connect.
