2010-01-22T09:39:00.000Z	DARKGuy		Hey, I have a 9800GTX+ and ubuntu insists on installing 18X drivers when there are 195.X drivers available. Does anybody know a way to force it? I installed it yesterday through the .bin installer + nvidia-xconfig and today it is like if I hadn't installed it before :/
2010-01-22T09:40:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	DARKGuy	Uninstall the 18X thing first in Hardware Drivers (if you haven't done that).
2010-01-22T09:40:00.000Z	DARKGuy	kinja-sheep	I never installed it in first place :P
2010-01-22T09:40:00.000Z	DARKGuy	kinja-sheep	but it insists on downloading it when I try to enable compiz :(
2010-01-22T09:40:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	DARKGuy	Oh really? That is crazy. :\
2010-01-22T09:40:00.000Z	DARKGuy	kinja-sheep	totally o.O
2010-01-22T09:41:00.000Z	DARKGuy	kinja-sheep	and duh! it had 173 enabled :/
2010-01-22T09:41:00.000Z	DARKGuy		wtf with nvidia and ubuntu, their drivers are always outdated :(
2010-01-22T09:41:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	DARKGuy	See !latest for a reason.
2010-01-22T09:42:00.000Z	DARKGuy		!latest
2010-01-22T09:42:00.000Z	DARKGuy	kinja-sheep	Ah I see XD. Well at least it's not debian @.@. Is there a way to have the latest of the latest ?
2010-01-22T09:43:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	DARKGuy	For your Nvidia issues, you might want to try #nvidia -- Also, if you want to have latest of the latest (in everything), consider using ArchLinux at the least.
2010-01-22T09:43:00.000Z	DARKGuy	kinja-sheep	I have, but it's a pain to maintain, so that's why I moved to Ubuntu to *use* the PC instead of tweak with it, but this is ridiculous.
2010-01-22T09:44:00.000Z	DARKGuy	kinja-sheep	and this isn't an nvidia issue, it's an *ubuntu* issue :/
2010-01-22T09:45:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	DARKGuy	It also does mean they might know how to overcome this *ubuntu* issue -- if that's an *ubuntu* issue or *nvidia* issue.
2010-01-22T09:45:00.000Z	DARKGuy	kinja-sheep	well in that you're right, I guess I'll give it a shot
2010-01-22T09:46:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	DARKGuy	And the fact that you said you moved to Ubuntu to *use* the PC, forget about 19X, just use the *d* thing. Don't tweak it. :-)
2010-01-22T09:46:00.000Z	DARKGuy	kinja-sheep	XD I would, but video drivers are very, -very- important for me to have updated :P.... software can stay on "stable" for all I care xD
2010-01-22T09:50:00.000Z	DARKGuy	kinja-sheep	well just in case, this seems to fix it ^_^ -> http://www.webupd8.org/2009/08/how-to-install-nvidia-190xx-drivers-in.html
2010-01-22T09:51:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	DARKGuy	Thanks for the head up.
2010-01-22T09:52:00.000Z	DARKGuy	kinja-sheep	no prob :p
