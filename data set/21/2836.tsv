2009-07-07T22:47:00.000Z	Apollo2366		Hey, my friend is running Jaunty with all updates installed. Up until now he hasn't had any problems with it, but today he tried accessing the music on his phone, an LG Rumor, via USB. He says that the computer doesn't even recognize the phone. Help?
2009-07-07T22:48:00.000Z	edbian	Apollo2366	Is there a /dev file made when the phone is plugged in?
2009-07-07T22:49:00.000Z	Apollo2366	edbian	not sure, where would I check?
2009-07-07T22:49:00.000Z	Apollo2366	edbian	probably in /dev righht?
2009-07-07T22:49:00.000Z	edbian	Apollo2366	You can look at /dev directly and also run "dmesg" before and after plugging the phone in.
2009-07-07T22:50:00.000Z	Apollo2366	edbian	thanks. I'll come back here with the out-put
2009-07-07T22:51:00.000Z	edbian	Apollo2366	Look at both places before and after you plug the phone in.
2009-07-07T22:57:00.000Z	edbian	Apollo2366	How's it going?
2009-07-07T22:57:00.000Z	Apollo2366	edbian	it's taking a while, we're doing this over IM
2009-07-07T22:58:00.000Z	edbian	Apollo2366	Are you in turn helping somebody else?  Why not just have that person get on the irc channels?
2009-07-07T22:59:00.000Z	Apollo2366	edbian	I'm working on getting him in here now, and also he says it created a file whenever he plugged the phone in
2009-07-07T23:00:00.000Z	edbian	Apollo2366	If the phone is a USB storage device it should create a file.  That is correct :)
2009-07-07T23:04:00.000Z	Apollo2366	edbian	so now what? He still can't access the phone
2009-07-07T23:04:00.000Z	edbian	Apollo2366	does it have a /dev  ?  What did dmesg say?  I'm just trying to find out if ubuntu sees the phone at all.
2009-07-07T23:05:00.000Z	Apollo2366	edbian	we've determined that it does create a /dev file whenever he plugs it in. He still hasn't run dmesg yet and I'm still trying to get him in here.
2009-07-07T23:06:00.000Z	edbian	Apollo2366	When he does get in here get him into a room with just him you and I
2009-07-07T23:06:00.000Z	edbian	Apollo2366	What is the dev file?  /dev/sdb1 or something?  When he puts files on the phone does he usually just drag and drop them into the folder the gnome makes??
2009-07-07T23:06:00.000Z	Apollo2366	edbian	how do I do that? Make a room, that is.
2009-07-07T23:08:00.000Z	edbian	Apollo2366	you just "/join #a room that doesn't already exist" to create a new room.  Then tell me and him the name you choose so we can "/join <room>"
2009-07-07T23:09:00.000Z	Apollo2366	edbian	the room is #edbian-apollo-mike
2009-07-07T23:10:00.000Z	edbian	Apollo2366	I'm there!
