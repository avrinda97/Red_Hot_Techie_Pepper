2010-12-29T14:45:00.000Z	woot_woot	alif	dont be logged in as root and dont sudo
2010-12-29T14:45:00.000Z	woot_woot	alif	then the application you start wont run as root
2010-12-29T14:47:00.000Z	alif	woot_woot	but this program ask me use my root, for run it
2010-12-29T14:48:00.000Z	woot_woot	alif	if the application tells you to run as root, it means it needs permissions your user doesn't have
2010-12-29T14:48:00.000Z	woot_woot	alif	so you have to run it with sudo or as root

2010-12-29T14:56:00.000Z	woot_woot	alif	backtrack user has permissions your ubuntu user account doesn't have

2010-12-29T15:05:00.000Z	woot_woot	alif	 you will have to google how to add yourself to sudoers file. you clearly don't know enough about linux for me to feel comfortable telling you how to do it
2010-12-29T15:05:00.000Z	alif	woot_woot	: how i can run this program not as root??
