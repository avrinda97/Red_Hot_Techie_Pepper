2005-06-09T10:07:00.000Z	shad0w1e		I tried out gentoo , it was a failure but I really learned how linux worked from it and now I can probably do my own crazy ass install
2005-06-09T10:08:00.000Z	nalioth	shad0w1e	if you change the install lang to chinese or sanskrit, it all becomes a crazy ass install
2005-10-05T15:32:00.000Z	nalioth	shad0w1e	are you compiling in a terminal?
2005-10-05T15:33:00.000Z	shad0w1e	nalioth	I'm using the NVIDIA installer
2005-10-05T15:33:00.000Z	nalioth	shad0w1e	in a terminal?
2005-10-05T15:33:00.000Z	shad0w1e	nalioth	yes
2005-10-05T15:33:00.000Z	nalioth	shad0w1e	type this before you run the installer export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-<whatever>
2005-10-05T15:35:00.000Z	shad0w1e	nalioth	thanks so much!!!!
