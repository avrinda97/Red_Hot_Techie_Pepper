2010-07-20T23:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	in what context?
2010-07-20T23:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	installing a program you can use software centre. Nice and simple
2010-07-20T23:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	there is an update manager app under the system menu
2010-07-20T23:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	why are those hard?
2010-07-20T23:32:00.000Z	aleksi	ActionParsnip	they dont work.
2010-07-20T23:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	can you expand on that please
2010-07-20T23:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	details and any error messages you get are useful
2010-07-20T23:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	edgy isn't supported anymore so the repos won't have folders and debs for edgy
2010-07-20T23:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	hardy, jauny, karmic and lucid are supported here and maverick in #ubuntu+1
2010-07-20T23:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	watch the language please. This is a family channel
2010-07-20T23:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	you can use usb-creator-gtk and the lucid iso, or if you have a windows machine there are apps for putting iso files on usb to install from
2010-07-20T23:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	if you have a windows machine around: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/create-a-ubuntu-9-10-live-usb-in-windows/
2010-07-20T23:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	remember to md5sum the iso so you know the file is complete and consistant
2010-07-20T23:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	the link ubottu gave tells you how you can upgrade EOL releases
2010-07-20T23:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	you will need to jump to the next release, then the next, then the next. It'd be a lot uicker and cleaner to clean install
2010-07-20T23:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	lsb_release -c ,will tell you
2010-07-20T23:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aleksi	system -> admin ,should be in there. Not sure about edgy
2010-07-20T23:49:00.000Z	aleksi	ActionParsnip	its not there so thats why i am stuck
