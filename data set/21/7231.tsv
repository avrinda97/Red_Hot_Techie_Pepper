2008-06-28T06:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	craigbass1976	-d is for installing a development release
2008-06-28T06:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	craigbass1976	I am guessing that you do *not* want to do that
2008-06-28T06:46:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Jordan_U	well, I need to get out of dapper
2008-06-28T06:46:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Jordan_U	and don't really feel like reinstalling
2008-06-28T06:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	craigbass1976	Then just do "update-manager" do NOT put a -d at the end
2008-06-28T06:46:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Jordan_U	update-manager wasn't giving me the option to upgrade
2008-06-28T06:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	craigbass1976	Then add "-c"
2010-09-05T02:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	craigbass1976	Yes, testdisk has an option for that (can't remember off hand how to get to it). What is the filestem and what error do get when mounting it though?
2010-09-05T02:25:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Jordan_U	erUSUL forget it.  I didn't realize photorec was part of testdisk.  I'm copying files off now, will reformat/repartition the disk when I'm done, and tell the guy "it's not a backup if it's your only copy, dump to this AFTER YOU'VE ALREADY SAVED LOCALLY."
2010-12-23T06:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	craigbass1976	nm-applet
2010-12-23T06:12:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Jordan_U	thanks.  It says it's already running, ps confirms this.  Darned if I see it anywhere though.
2010-12-23T06:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	craigbass1976	I missed where Livin4Jesus stated what nvidia card he has. What makes you think that it's a problem with a legacy nvidia card?
2010-12-23T06:15:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Jordan_U	Meh?  I'm talking about network manager, not nvidia
2011-08-19T22:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	craigbass1976	You will need to install the windows jre in wine.
2011-08-19T22:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	craigbass1976	What are you actually trying to run?
2011-08-19T22:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	craigbass1976	It's a java app, what happens when you try to run it from a linux JRE?
2011-08-19T23:21:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Jordan_U	it didn't run back when I tried the mac version a few months ago; I think it's still making calls to OS specific stuff.
2012-05-12T04:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	craigbass1976	How did you configure the script to run at boot? How are you running it after boot?
2012-05-12T04:14:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Jordan_U	update-rc.d start-stream defaults  where start-stream is a script that restarts icecast (in case it wasn't running) and starts darkice using suchandsuch as a config file
2012-05-12T04:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	craigbass1976	I asked two questions. You answed only one of them.
2012-05-12T04:18:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Jordan_U	Oh.  After boot I just do a /etc/init.d/start-stream
