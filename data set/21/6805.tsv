2007-01-26T16:04:00.000Z	ikonia	pbureau	probably
2007-01-26T16:08:00.000Z	ikonia	pbureau	looked like /proc/cpuinfo
2007-01-26T16:13:00.000Z	ikonia	pbureau	whats the problem ?
2007-01-26T16:15:00.000Z	ikonia	pbureau	how does it know network/none-network - it should just be mount points
2007-01-26T16:16:00.000Z	ikonia	pbureau	shouldn't be on an ip - should be mounted
2007-01-26T16:21:00.000Z	ikonia	pbureau	is the network drive a seperate device or a drive in an ubuntu server
2007-01-26T16:21:00.000Z	ikonia	pbureau	thats because your not mounting the drive
2007-01-26T16:21:00.000Z	ikonia	pbureau	you clearly know it all......come back when you want to chat
2007-01-26T16:21:00.000Z	ikonia	pbureau	perhaps thats what you should have asked before shooting me down with "for the record you don't do...blah blah"
2007-01-26T16:22:00.000Z	ikonia	pbureau	if you want to fool your device - you'll have to mount it
2007-01-26T16:23:00.000Z	ikonia	pbureau	what file system is it running
2007-01-26T16:24:00.000Z	ikonia	pbureau	ok - so you want to mount it over samba
2007-01-29T12:57:00.000Z	ikonia	pbureau	not without cannon support it doesn't
2007-02-14T08:50:00.000Z	ikonia	pbureau	pardon ?
