2007-04-02T09:47:00.000Z	maxxism		hey all.  anyone good with NFS?   I am having some speed issues mounting NFS shares over 100MB network.  it takes over 3 minutes mount a share.  they mount and work ok.  but it never used to take this long.
2007-04-02T09:48:00.000Z	craigbass1976	maxxism	I just ran into the same problem today.  Are you mounting a big export?
2007-04-02T09:48:00.000Z	maxxism	craigbass1976	 one is 120GB.  the other one is 40.
2007-04-02T09:49:00.000Z	maxxism	craigbass1976	 i recently upgraded the client side to feisty.  the server is still edgy
2007-04-02T09:50:00.000Z	craigbass1976	maxxism	hmmm.  Well, I had the exact same setup in Fedora5 (on server and client) and today when I finally set it up again (dapper server and edgy client) it's slow as hell.
2007-04-02T09:50:00.000Z	maxxism	craigbass1976	 yeah.  its odd.  It was wicked fast before with edgy edgy.
2007-04-02T09:50:00.000Z	craigbass1976	maxxism	I also notice real slow ssh logins at first too.  Takes forever after taking the password.  But now it's ok.
2007-04-02T09:51:00.000Z	maxxism	craigbass1976	 ssh is fine here.
2007-04-02T09:51:00.000Z	craigbass1976	maxxism	wick fast?  Are you up here in the NE with me?
2007-04-02T09:51:00.000Z	maxxism	craigbass1976	 canada west
2007-04-02T09:51:00.000Z	craigbass1976	maxxism	I didn't know they said wicked out there too.  Us Mainahs get made fun of for it.
2007-04-02T09:52:00.000Z	maxxism	craigbass1976	funny.
2007-04-02T09:53:00.000Z	maxxism	craigbass1976	i wonder if problem is feisty based for me..
2007-04-02T09:54:00.000Z	craigbass1976	maxxism	I don't know.  Like I said, dapper server and edgy client are slow here on mounting.  After that I'm ok, but mounting takes forever.
2007-04-02T09:55:00.000Z	maxxism	craigbass1976	before it was like mounting a drive in the machine.  hmmm maybe my exports file is buggared
2007-04-02T09:56:00.000Z	craigbass1976	maxxism	I'm not used to this weird exports (UUID blahblah) file.  I wonder if they have anything to do with it.
2007-04-02T09:57:00.000Z	maxxism	craigbass1976	I didnt use UUID
2007-04-02T09:57:00.000Z	maxxism	craigbass1976	I didnt use UUID's  i think thats the new fstabs
2007-04-02T09:58:00.000Z	craigbass1976	maxxism	well, I've never seen them before today.  When I went into exports I said "wtf is this" and then found out that you don't have to have that line
2007-04-02T09:59:00.000Z	maxxism	craigbass1976	i am gonna take another look.
2007-04-02T10:00:00.000Z	maxxism	craigbass1976	 yeah man.   I dont see any UUID stuff in my exports
