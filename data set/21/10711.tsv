2005-04-03T08:37:00.000Z	zooko		greetings, people of #ubuntu!
2005-04-03T08:37:00.000Z	zooko		This doesn't work: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/KernelBuildpackageHowtob
2005-04-03T08:37:00.000Z	zooko		on my current hoary amd64 system.
2005-04-03T08:38:00.000Z	zooko		It compiled the whole thing, then got an error attempting to ls something "amd64" something "generic".
2005-04-03T08:38:00.000Z	zooko		This failure of ls caused it not to create the .deb file.  :-?
2005-04-03T08:39:00.000Z	zooko		When did it fork?
2005-04-03T08:39:00.000Z	tritium	zooko	try using kernel-package to build your kernel
2005-04-03T08:40:00.000Z	zooko	tritium	I have tried that.  Unfortunately the resulting kernel couldn't boot...
2005-04-03T08:49:00.000Z	tritium	zooko	kernel-package
2005-04-03T08:58:00.000Z	tritium	zooko	which one is it?
2005-04-03T08:59:00.000Z	tritium	zooko	ghc6 is available, at least on i386
2005-04-03T09:00:00.000Z	tritium	zooko	do you have universe included in your /etc/apt/sources.list?
2005-04-03T09:34:00.000Z	tritium	zooko	there are configs in /boot for kernel images you have installed
2005-04-03T09:34:00.000Z	zooko	tritium	excellent!  Thanks!
2005-04-04T11:20:00.000Z	tritium	zooko	bugzilla.ubuntu.com
2005-04-04T11:20:00.000Z	zooko	tritium	thanks
2005-04-05T08:42:00.000Z	tritium	zooko	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RootSudo is what you're referring to
2005-05-14T09:24:00.000Z	tritium	zooko	no, in fact, it's not supported.  Don't use it
2005-05-14T09:24:00.000Z	tritium	zooko	2.6.11 has no linux-restricted-modules, and is not supported
2005-05-14T09:29:00.000Z	tritium	zooko	you're using linux-source-2.6.10 ?
2005-05-14T09:32:00.000Z	zooko	tritium	yes
