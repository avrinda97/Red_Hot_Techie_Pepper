2009-12-06T12:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	merciless	 tried it via a command line yet?
2009-12-06T12:34:00.000Z	merciless	Dr_Willis	darksector; i have some important files in my usb copied from a windows system which i have to use.... usually it automounts but now it isn't mounting manually also....i inserted it in my friends system again and it is asking me to format the drive....i dont want to lose the data
2009-12-06T12:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	merciless	 try the -t vfat or -t ntfs option perhaps.
2009-12-06T12:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	merciless	 use 'sudo fdisk -l' to see what fs the device is.

2009-12-06T13:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	merciless	 assume people on irc have a 40 sec attention span.. :) whats not working?
2009-12-06T13:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	merciless	 i dont rember what your original problem is/was.
2009-12-06T13:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	merciless	 if windows says its 'bad' and wants to reformat it. its possible it is bad.
2009-12-06T13:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	merciless	 if it has a windows filesystem on it. I would suggest letting windows try to 'fix' it. you could dd it to a file under linux as extra protection.
2009-12-06T13:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	merciless	 dd it to a file.  and try to recover data from that dd image.
2009-12-06T13:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	merciless	 what does 'sudo fdisk -l' say about the device - what filesystem?
2009-12-06T13:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	merciless	 its a command to dump data to a file.
2009-12-06T13:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	merciless	 notice how below that - it dosent say any info about the device.. thats... not good.
2009-12-06T13:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	merciless	 'dd if=/dev/sdc of=myusb.img'   should image it to the file.
2009-12-06T13:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	merciless	 try to mount it via the mount command and loop option
2009-12-06T13:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	merciless	  sudo mount whatever.img /mnt/  -t vfat (or whatever) -o loop
2009-12-06T13:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	merciless	 or some similer to that command.
2009-12-06T13:35:00.000Z	merciless	Dr_Willis	lluz; any idea?
2009-12-06T13:36:00.000Z	merciless	Dr_Willis	lluz; I have very important data....i dont know why its showing me empty
