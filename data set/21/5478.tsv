2007-11-02T09:23:00.000Z	Chamunks		More importantly is it possible to recover data off a usb key disk thats been formatted?
2007-11-02T09:23:00.000Z	Chamunks		or simply erased from the filesystem
2007-11-02T09:23:00.000Z	scguy318	Chamunks	probably Photorec or testdisk
2007-11-02T09:23:00.000Z	scguy318	Chamunks	most likely only the partition table was wiped
2007-11-02T09:24:00.000Z	Chamunks	scguy318	well the goal is to find a way to irrecoverably remove a file in an instant of urgency
2007-11-02T09:24:00.000Z	scguy318	Chamunks	ah, you want to securely delete a file
2007-11-02T09:24:00.000Z	Chamunks	scguy318	yep :)
2007-11-02T09:25:00.000Z	scguy318	Chamunks	the shred command I think?
2007-11-02T09:25:00.000Z	Chamunks	scguy318	I'm just kindof delving into the whole concept of flash disk data destruction
2007-11-02T09:25:00.000Z	scguy318	Chamunks	man shred for info
2007-11-02T09:26:00.000Z	Chamunks	scguy318	well lets say I use a keydisk to contain some keyfiles for some encrypted disks and encrypted volumes contained within this volume
2007-11-02T09:26:00.000Z	scguy318	Chamunks	playing with TrueCrypt
2007-11-02T09:26:00.000Z	Chamunks	scguy318	in a sense the destruction of the known keyfiles would render the password useless
2007-11-02T09:27:00.000Z	scguy318	Chamunks	so I'm guessing you want to wipe those keyfiles?
2007-11-02T09:27:00.000Z	Chamunks	scguy318	among other things yeah im just trying to conceptualise the perfect framework for data security
2007-11-02T09:27:00.000Z	Chamunks	scguy318	if the situation ever arrose yes
2007-11-02T09:28:00.000Z	scguy318	Chamunks	well, don't look at me, my password is 12345 :P
2007-11-02T09:28:00.000Z	scguy318	Chamunks	my Ubuntu account pass anyway
2007-11-02T09:28:00.000Z	Chamunks	scguy318	im thinking maybe depending on the extremity of the situation just a microwave would suffice
2007-11-02T09:29:00.000Z	Chamunks	scguy318	i sure hope you dont have ssh enabled to the public if your flaunting that fact :P
2007-11-02T09:29:00.000Z	scguy318	Chamunks	no services on here
