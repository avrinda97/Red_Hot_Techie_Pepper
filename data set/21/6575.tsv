2007-03-06T14:12:00.000Z	gyaresu	Defro_G	Ethernet over USB? Is that what you mean?
2007-03-06T14:13:00.000Z	Defro_G	gyaresu	crdlb: I'ts a USB direct Link cable goes on usb port's and make a "network" for 2 pc's
2007-03-06T14:13:00.000Z	Defro_G	gyaresu	crdlb: But i don't see nothing
2007-03-06T14:15:00.000Z	gyaresu	Defro_G	Is this a special usb cable? Some device you bought? or Just a standard one?
2007-03-06T14:16:00.000Z	Defro_G	gyaresu	yes it's a special cable the same conectors in both sides, (i hope you understand me)
2007-03-06T14:21:00.000Z	Defro_G	gyaresu	i read something about "usbnet driver" but i don't know how it works....if i connect the cable nothing happen
2007-03-06T14:22:00.000Z	gyaresu	Defro_G	Ethernet over usb is not a common thing (interesting though) have you got a link?
2007-03-06T14:23:00.000Z	Defro_G	gyaresu	http://www.linux-usb.org/usbnet/
2007-03-06T14:24:00.000Z	gyaresu	Defro_G	Looking.
2007-03-06T14:27:00.000Z	gyaresu	Defro_G	So you have one of these special cables then?
2007-03-06T14:27:00.000Z	gyaresu	Defro_G	Cool.
2007-03-06T14:30:00.000Z	gyaresu	Defro_G	From the look of it you can 'sudo modprobe usbnet' to get the driver and then check 'dmesg' to see if devices have been recognised. BTW 'ethtool' is a great prog for looking at ethernet devices and seeing what the hardware is running at.
2007-03-06T14:33:00.000Z	Defro_G	gyaresu	i try rigth now tnx
2007-03-06T14:38:00.000Z	Defro_G	gyaresu	i got that http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8980/
2007-03-06T14:41:00.000Z	gyaresu	Defro_G	Ok. So usbnet is loaded. You still want the end of dmesg to see what device name it's given your device. Or ifconfig. then 'sudo ethtool ethX' (or whatever)
2007-03-06T14:45:00.000Z	Defro_G	gyaresu	nothing on dmesg
2007-03-06T14:45:00.000Z	Defro_G	gyaresu	ok thank a lot y search........
2007-03-06T14:46:00.000Z	gyaresu	Defro_G	'ifconfig' ?
2007-03-06T14:47:00.000Z	gyaresu	Defro_G	Once you've got a device listed then you need to assign and IP to it.. I hope this is worth it. You'd be better off with a couple of network cards... Anyway. Good lukc.
