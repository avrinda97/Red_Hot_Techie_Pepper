2007-12-02T22:29:00.000Z	breakerfall		this distro has, quite possibly, the worst installation I've ever seen. It simply stinks.
2007-12-02T22:29:00.000Z	LjL	breakerfall	got a question, or simply want to moan?
2007-12-02T22:30:00.000Z	LjL	breakerfall	then #ubuntu-offtopic please
2007-12-02T22:31:00.000Z	LjL	breakerfall	can you reach a terminal by hitting Alt+F1?
2007-12-02T22:31:00.000Z	breakerfall	LjL	no, the computer hangs.
2007-12-02T22:32:00.000Z	LjL	breakerfall	start in recovery mode then, type « sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg », and select "vesa" as the display driver, then try booting normally
2007-12-02T22:32:00.000Z	breakerfall	LjL	I'll give it a try, thanks.
2007-12-02T22:37:00.000Z	breakerfall	LjL	that doesn't work
2007-12-02T22:38:00.000Z	LjL	breakerfall	doesn't work because it still hangs, or doesn't work because the command doesn't work?
2007-12-02T22:38:00.000Z	breakerfall	LjL	the command doesn't work...
2007-12-02T22:38:00.000Z	LjL	breakerfall	well what does it complain about?
2007-12-02T22:39:00.000Z	breakerfall	LjL	a warning that I'm overwriting the config
2007-12-02T22:39:00.000Z	LjL	breakerfall	try without the "-phigh" then (it will ask many questions then, the defaults should be fine however)
2007-12-02T22:41:00.000Z	breakerfall	LjL	still no joy
2007-12-02T22:47:00.000Z	LjL	breakerfall	i'm not sure i know how to help you further
2007-12-02T22:47:00.000Z	breakerfall	LjL	I used another method to change the xorg.conf to vesa
2007-12-02T22:49:00.000Z	LjL	breakerfall	then it's likely not X. check /var/log/syslog and /var/log/boot and /var/log/kern.log from recovery mode, see what's done last during boot before it hangs
2007-12-02T22:54:00.000Z	breakerfall	LjL	all of my log files are empty
2007-12-02T22:54:00.000Z	LjL	breakerfall	in that case the problem is *well* before X get started, i'd say...! do you even seen the splash screen?
2007-12-02T22:55:00.000Z	breakerfall	LjL	yeah, the splash screen with the progress bar?
2007-12-02T22:55:00.000Z	LjL	breakerfall	yes... the logs really shouldn't be empty if you see that :|
