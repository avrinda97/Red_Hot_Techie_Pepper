2012-01-10T11:07:00.000Z	ponrajuganesh_		I am trying to use password less ssh, it is working for the user:temp but not the root user? what could be the problem?
2012-01-10T11:07:00.000Z	ponrajuganesh_		could anyone help pls
2012-01-10T11:08:00.000Z	Skeme	ponrajuganesh_	dont do that
2012-01-10T11:08:00.000Z	Skeme	ponrajuganesh_	let them sudo
2012-01-10T11:08:00.000Z	Skeme	ponrajuganesh_	dont let root ssh in with no password JC
2012-01-10T11:08:00.000Z	ponrajuganesh_		I need to send many files to other server and then start them, for every scp I cant ask for the sw @Skeme
2012-01-10T11:09:00.000Z	ponrajuganesh_		only so asking ? pls do get the ways or if anyother way is there? Skeme
2012-01-10T11:10:00.000Z	Skeme	ponrajuganesh_	check ssh-copy-id but again I would probably not recommend doing that from root
2012-01-10T11:11:00.000Z	Skeme	ponrajuganesh_	su to root, then ssh-copy-id root@remoteserver.com .. then put in your password .. done
2012-01-10T11:11:00.000Z	ponrajuganesh_		I understand Y u say those, but is there any other way? @Skeme, need to send an xml file and a java file and should start the java file
2012-01-10T11:13:00.000Z	Skeme	ponrajuganesh_	not sure how you could execute the java file after scping it up there.. maybe make a script on the remote server to scp Pull the file to it, then execute it
2012-01-10T11:14:00.000Z	ponrajuganesh_		Ya that could be done @Skeme , but the thing is need to send these files with the scp , every time it may be asking password, so is there any other way to make the scp not to ask password?
2012-01-10T11:15:00.000Z	ponrajuganesh_		I mean I could run a code there after scping @Skeme, but the problem is to pass those files with the password
2012-01-10T11:15:00.000Z	Skeme	ponrajuganesh_	yes, once you do the ssh-copy-id .. it will no longer ask for password
2012-01-10T11:16:00.000Z	ponrajuganesh_		is this command right should ? ssh-copy-id root@remoteSErverIP @Skeme
2012-01-10T11:17:00.000Z	ponrajuganesh_		I am getting this as error, @Skeme "mkdir: Failed to make directory "~/.ssh"; No such file or directory sh: ~/.ssh/authorized_keys: cannot create"
2012-01-10T11:18:00.000Z	Skeme	ponrajuganesh_	run ssh-keygen first
2012-01-10T11:19:00.000Z	ponrajuganesh_	Skeme	are these the steps 1.ssh-keygen 2.ssh-copy-id root@remoteIPaddress or should we add any more
2012-01-10T11:20:00.000Z	Skeme	ponrajuganesh_	that should do it.. when you run ssh-keygen just take all the default answers.. then run #2
2012-01-10T11:21:00.000Z	ponrajuganesh_	Skeme	it says the same error?
2012-01-10T11:24:00.000Z	Skeme	ponrajuganesh_	umm thats weird that you cant make a folde rin your home dir
