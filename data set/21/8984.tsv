2006-05-13T16:42:00.000Z	zelevw		rudemeister: yes, through ssh...possible?
2006-05-13T16:43:00.000Z	zelevw		rudemeister: can u point me in the right direction?
2006-05-13T14:31:00.000Z	zelevw		hi...is it normal for prelink to take very long after installing updates to your system?  it also complained that some files had the wrong magic bytes in them...
2006-05-13T05:02:00.000Z	zelevw		hi...the most bizarre thing is happening to my system...im now connected using mIRC through a vmware XP session but if I try to connect with xchat from within ubuntu 5.10 it just hangs...what could it be? it started happening after i upgraded the firmware on my router...it only happens at the office...if i go home it works like a charm...gdesklets wont update either...???
2006-05-13T05:03:00.000Z	zelevw		BitchX also hangs trying to connect
2006-05-13T05:04:00.000Z	timeless	zelevw	not that i'm a native here, but does telnet irc.server 6667 work?
2006-05-13T05:04:00.000Z	zelevw	timeless	ill try it rite now.
2006-05-13T05:05:00.000Z	zelevw	timeless	Trying 1.0.0.0... then it stays there...I tried that before...
2006-05-13T05:06:00.000Z	zelevw	timeless	i used irc.debian.org 6667
2006-05-13T05:06:00.000Z	zelevw	timeless	but 1.0.0.0 shows up...???
2006-05-13T05:06:00.000Z	zelevw	timeless	i can dig, nslookup, ftp no problem
2006-05-13T05:08:00.000Z	timeless	zelevw	did you get a connection?
2006-05-13T05:09:00.000Z	zelevw	timeless	it resolves...but telnet still tries to go to 1.0.0.0
2006-05-13T05:09:00.000Z	timeless	zelevw	ok, iniku is probably right, but i'm not the one to know how to disable ipv6, good luck
2006-05-13T05:09:00.000Z	zelevw	timeless	thank you.
2006-05-13T05:11:00.000Z	timeless	zelevw	i don't suppose windows is using pppoe?

2006-05-13T05:12:00.000Z	timeless	zelevw	this would be a question for the windows network neighborhood/configuration or something
2006-05-13T05:13:00.000Z	zelevw	timeless	the xp session works fine...my ubuntu doesnt
2006-05-13T05:13:00.000Z	zelevw	timeless	vmware is being natted
