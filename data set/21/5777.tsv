2007-12-20T09:31:00.000Z	ogre		whats the difference between the ubuntu cd installer and dvd installer? are there more packages ir something?
2007-12-20T09:32:00.000Z	jrib	ogre	same thing except dvd contains all of the main and restricted repos on it, so you can use the dvd as a repo instead of going online
