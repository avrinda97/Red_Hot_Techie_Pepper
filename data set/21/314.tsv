2012-03-28T16:08:00.000Z	iNable		hi
2012-03-28T16:10:00.000Z	iNable		using 11.10 with gnome-shell instead of unity... worked fine for a while but now if i open up the "dashboard" and start typing to open apps the whole window manager restarts and sometimes even just breaks without restarting forcing me to plull the plug... googled and didn't really found something... any ideas?
2012-03-28T16:11:00.000Z	bazhang	iNable	what graphics card, which drivers how installed,
2012-03-28T16:11:00.000Z	iNable		nvidia geforce gt8600m latest nvidia drivers installed
2012-03-28T16:12:00.000Z	bazhang		nvidia-current? iNable from where
2012-03-28T16:12:00.000Z	iNable		nothing in particular
2012-03-28T16:13:00.000Z	iNable	bazhang	first via adding a ppa, but after installing the nvidia-current driver ubuntu told me there's a recomended newer driver... so i installed via the advanced driver options
2012-03-28T16:14:00.000Z	bazhang	iNable	and how did you remove the ppa
2012-03-28T16:14:00.000Z	iNable	bazhang	standard i guess simply removing from the list
2012-03-28T16:15:00.000Z	bazhang	iNable	not using ppa purge? just manually editing the sources.list and removing the drivers with the package manager or what
2012-03-28T16:16:00.000Z	iNable		just manually removing
2012-03-28T16:16:00.000Z	bazhang	iNable	with which command
2012-03-28T16:17:00.000Z	iNable		it might have something to do with docky becuase it get some errors ... docky needs composition
2012-03-28T16:17:00.000Z	iNable		but in my optionion i configured everything right
2012-03-28T16:17:00.000Z	bazhang	iNable	using which command to remove the drivers manually
2012-03-28T16:18:00.000Z	iNable	bazhang	ehm i don't understand... i just installed the new ones and removed the reposity from my package list... do i have to remove the driver itself before isntalling a new one?!
2012-03-28T16:18:00.000Z	bazhang	iNable	of course yes
2012-03-28T16:19:00.000Z	iNable		oh ... didn√Ñt know that...
2012-03-28T16:19:00.000Z	iNable		*didn't
2012-03-28T16:19:00.000Z	bazhang		!ppa-purge | iNable
