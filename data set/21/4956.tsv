2008-03-20T18:45:00.000Z	sugoruyo		does anyone know anything about the problem i just mentioned?
2008-03-20T18:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sugoruyo	usb is slow. have patience
2008-03-20T18:47:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ActionParsnip	3 hours ago i'd get 5.5mb/s
2008-03-20T18:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sugoruyo	do it over night :)
2008-03-20T18:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sugoruyo	is the usb drive basically a hdd in a caddy. as you could dismantle it and use PATA speed (or SATA if thats what it is)
2008-03-20T18:53:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ActionParsnip	it's a Seagate FreeAgent, not really dismantleable unless you wanna void the warranty and break stuff in the process (no screws, it's clipped on and has two clips that break when you open it)
2008-03-20T18:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sugoruyo	ah, no dice there then. I always make sure they are dismantlable for REAL speed (USB s slow)
2008-03-20T18:54:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ActionParsnip	i don't really mind USB speed...
2011-03-09T13:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sugoruyo	the top lines are the name and installed versions. The list below are what versions are available and on what server
2011-03-09T13:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sugoruyo	why does it need to be official?
2011-03-09T13:16:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ActionParsnip	i'd like it to be from the designers of the debian packaging system, but it doesn't *need* to be, i just want to know more about what metadata the system keeps about a package, i'm doing some work on explaining linux to some technical, non-linuxy people and package management is a big thing in our context
2011-03-09T13:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sugoruyo	optional means you installed it or it was pulled down as a recommended package
2011-03-09T13:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sugoruyo	the suggested packages are nice to have but are nonessential
2011-03-09T13:18:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ActionParsnip	yeah, i get that, but i doubt it's documented as such by the designers of dpkg
2011-03-09T13:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sugoruyo	it will be very documented. So people coding apps usd the same stuff
2011-03-09T13:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sugoruyo	think about what a Linux distro ACTUALLY is and what it is madd off
2011-03-09T13:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sugoruyo	many small projects combine to make the distro so the xorg team will work very closely with intel for their driver to work and it will ALL be documented
2011-03-09T13:23:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ActionParsnip	that's somewhat irrelevant to what i want
2011-03-09T13:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sugoruyo	you doubt the documentation of dpkg. I'm telling you it is due to the nature of Linux
2011-03-09T13:26:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ActionParsnip	i don't doubt the docs of dpkg, i'm trying to find if there is one (and which one) contains the info i need
2011-03-09T13:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sugoruyo	ask the devs I'm sure they can help. recognosco's link looks like a good start. You can also read the manpages of the commands
