2007-01-26T14:45:00.000Z	eternalswd	shifty	what codecs does mplayer list
2007-01-26T14:46:00.000Z	eternalswd	shifty	that are in the file even if it doesn't play
2007-01-26T14:47:00.000Z	eternalswd	shifty	not what codecs mplayer has, what codecs it lists for the file in question when run from the command line ie what decoders does it try to open?
2007-01-26T14:49:00.000Z	eternalswd	shifty	when running mplayer from the terminal, there should be a bunch of output in that terminal, something like "Opening video decoder: [ffmpeg]  FFmpeg's libavcodec codec family" should be in that output
2007-01-26T14:50:00.000Z	eternalswd	shifty	does the file play at all?  ie is the video blocky?
2007-01-26T15:00:00.000Z	eternalswd	shifty	what version of ubuntu do you have?
2007-01-26T15:04:00.000Z	eternalswd	shifty	what are you trying to remove?
2007-01-26T15:07:00.000Z	eternalswd	shifty	In synaptic, you can click the search button and search for packages. ie in this case search for mplayer
2007-01-26T15:08:00.000Z	eternalswd	shifty	In synaptic, then on the package listing you right click on the package and it gives you the option to "Mark for removal"
2007-01-26T15:09:00.000Z	eternalswd	shifty	In synaptic, then click apply and it should remove it.  If it is a dependency of other installed packages it will warn you
2007-01-28T09:27:00.000Z	eternalswd	shifty	are you using 2.0 or 1.5?
