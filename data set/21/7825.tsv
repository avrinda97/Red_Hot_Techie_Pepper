2006-09-25T15:16:00.000Z	DaRE		i cant partition? ive seen people talking about 2oses on 1 hdd
2006-09-25T15:16:00.000Z	DaRE		how would i go about setting up grub?
2006-09-25T15:18:00.000Z	DaRE		grub install
2006-09-25T15:18:00.000Z	someusernoob	DaRE	i dont liek to say it, but Vista (or windows) doesnt really want you to dualboot, so you'll lose grub anyway. What is your partition lay out now?
2006-09-25T15:19:00.000Z	someusernoob	DaRE	so you have a ext3 (ubuntu) partition and a swap partition?
2006-09-25T15:20:00.000Z	someusernoob	DaRE	install gparted from the repo's, and create a new NTFS partition with it.
2006-09-25T15:21:00.000Z	someusernoob	DaRE	then install Vista on that partition, it will remove grub, since Vista uses his own boot record, but dont worry, you can recover grub, and add Vista to it
2006-09-25T15:21:00.000Z	someusernoob	DaRE	on the internet you can find a lot of ways to recover grub
2006-09-25T15:23:00.000Z	someusernoob	DaRE	as far as i know, if you reinstall grub on your ubuntu partition, it will automaticly add ubuntu, and also vista, but im not sure of that last one, but you can manually add to the grub's menu.lst, but you have to install grub before you can do that
2006-09-25T15:25:00.000Z	someusernoob	DaRE	yep, but im not 100% sure it adds it automaticly, ive never installed windows after ubuntu, i only installed ubuntu and removed windows :D
2006-09-25T15:25:00.000Z	someusernoob	DaRE	ok, good luck!
2006-09-25T15:28:00.000Z	someusernoob	DaRE	or if you are more experienced with linux, you can partition with the alternate cd too, but it is more complicated then doing it with the live cd
2006-09-25T15:28:00.000Z	someusernoob	DaRE	with installer i meant gparted in the system menu...it is early :)
2006-09-25T15:29:00.000Z	someusernoob	DaRE	the live CD is on of the best things, and can help you in a lot of situations
