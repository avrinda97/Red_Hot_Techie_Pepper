2007-05-05T15:28:00.000Z	Fezzler		Having trouble
2007-05-05T15:29:00.000Z	Fezzler		Anyone able to assist newbie?
2007-05-05T15:30:00.000Z	Fezzler		Ubuntu Fiesty Fawn locked up after daughter was scrolling through screen saver selection
2007-05-05T15:30:00.000Z	Fezzler		I had to reboot and the computer rebooted to root@computername: #
2007-05-05T15:31:00.000Z	Fezzler		On start-up it said their were problems with corrupted files
2007-05-05T15:32:00.000Z	Fezzler		I ran fsck -y and then it booted back to gnome
2007-05-05T15:32:00.000Z	Fezzler		but I really have no idea what I'm doing
2007-05-05T15:33:00.000Z	Fezzler		Is there a Ubuntu program to check if my harddisk is bad?
2007-05-05T15:33:00.000Z	neildarlow	Fezzler	most likely a configuration file was damaged, fsck moved it to lost+found and it was recreated at next GNOME start
2007-05-05T15:43:00.000Z	neildarlow	Fezzler	look into your AGP settings e.g. Fast Write and speed
2007-05-05T15:44:00.000Z	neildarlow	Fezzler	you can explicity set them in /etc/X11/xorg.conf. the manpage for xorg.conf and your video driver will help
2007-05-05T15:45:00.000Z	neildarlow	Fezzler	disabling AGP fast write and setting speed to 4x might help. try each in turn
2007-05-05T15:46:00.000Z	neildarlow	Fezzler	you got it
2007-05-05T15:47:00.000Z	neildarlow	Fezzler	Applications|Accessories|Terminal and sudo
2007-05-05T15:48:00.000Z	neildarlow	Fezzler	from X, Ctrl-Alt-F1 and log in
2007-05-05T15:50:00.000Z	neildarlow	Fezzler	your GNOME session
2007-05-05T15:54:00.000Z	neildarlow	Fezzler	good. logout and Alt-F7 to get back to GNOME
2007-05-06T16:08:00.000Z	neildarlow	Fezzler	if Ctrl-Alt-Del won't reboot your system, it's a reset/power off i'm afraid
2007-05-06T16:09:00.000Z	neildarlow	Fezzler	what filesystem are you using?
2007-05-06T16:10:00.000Z	neildarlow	Fezzler	no, the underlying filesystem. Ext3 or something else?
2007-05-06T16:12:00.000Z	neildarlow	Fezzler	then it's probably Ext3 but it should handle lock-ups reasonably well
