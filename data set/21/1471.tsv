2010-11-04T20:38:00.000Z	ubuntunewb		so after waiting patiently for over 1/2 hr, still no help, where is the communit at
2010-11-04T20:38:00.000Z	area51pilot	ubuntunewb	 :) whats your question?
2010-11-04T20:40:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	area51pilot	i have one of those seemingly infamous 'GNOME Power Manager has not been installed correctly' problems in ubuntu 10.10 netbook edition
2010-11-04T20:42:00.000Z	area51pilot	ubuntunewb	well unfortunately, off hand I dont know the answer.  I will look around real quick for some options
2010-11-04T20:43:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	area51pilot	i tried numerous provided solutions out there but since i'm a newb on linux, i'm not familiar with sudo commands besides what's explicitly given that i can just copy
2010-11-04T20:44:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	area51pilot	but any help/suggestions you can that i can try out, all the more welcome :)
2010-11-04T20:45:00.000Z	area51pilot	ubuntunewb	I understand .... just hang out a few and I will look around. Someone else may be able to help also, just ask your question again if unanswered for some time
2010-11-04T20:46:00.000Z	area51pilot	ubuntunewb	is that the only message u get? any other abnormal behavior
2010-11-04T20:47:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	area51pilot	i suspect that i might have run out of HD space but after using the 'df' command, i'm only using 70156812 of the available 73900256 1K blocks
2010-11-04T20:48:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	area51pilot	and that's the only abnormal behavior experienced so far
2010-11-04T20:49:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	area51pilot	and i don't know how to get access to internet connection from the terminal either
2010-11-04T20:51:00.000Z	area51pilot	ubuntunewb	what kind of iNet access are you trying to get from terminal thats not available in the desktop?
2010-11-04T20:51:00.000Z	area51pilot	ubuntunewb	should be available as well
2010-11-04T20:52:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	area51pilot	i'm trying to hop onto the campus wifi
2010-11-04T20:52:00.000Z	area51pilot	ubuntunewb	your issue looks like it may be caused due to low space in the root drive
2010-11-04T20:59:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	area51pilot	and also thanks a lot for coming to my aid also, appreciate it!
2010-11-04T20:59:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	area51pilot	and if you know of any good linux books for beginners to learn from, please share
2010-11-04T21:00:00.000Z	area51pilot	ubuntunewb	the web has a lot of great resources  :)
2010-11-04T21:00:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	area51pilot	well what the few place(s) you would go to then? :)
2010-11-04T21:01:00.000Z	area51pilot	ubuntunewb	and the old faithful method is to get a machine and just start working it a little at a time ... whats the worst thatcan happen .... start over???  :P
2010-11-04T21:02:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	area51pilot	well i'll definitely start tinkering around more once i get a handle on the command lines haha, but after i offload all my files onto external storage :D
