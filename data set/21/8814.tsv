2006-01-07T11:32:00.000Z	ColonelPanique	MacXimain	: coompile it from source?
2006-01-07T11:32:00.000Z	ColonelPanique	MacXimain	: compile it even
2006-01-07T11:32:00.000Z	MacXimain		i have the Dapper Live CD and seem to be a newer version there
2006-01-07T11:33:00.000Z	MacXimain		compiling from source is not my friend.... I never have any luck :(
2006-01-07T11:33:00.000Z	MacXimain		if i can just upgrade my Samba i won't bother with Dapper
2006-01-07T11:33:00.000Z	ColonelPanique	MacXimain	: is there a specific feature or fix found in the latest version of Samba that you must have?  if not then you really don't have to get the latest version of Samba, or anything else for that matter... ;-P
2006-01-07T11:34:00.000Z	MacXimain		The newer version is Suppose to fix a problem with My Mac OS Hanging when it gets to the linux box... Seems to be a known issue according to the kubuntu forums
2006-01-07T11:35:00.000Z	MacXimain		...and why is that topyli
2006-01-07T11:36:00.000Z	ColonelPanique	MacXimain	: the kubuntu forums are not authoritative for Samba fixes.  if such an issue exists, and has been fixed, it will be listed in the Samba changelog / release notes, which are authoritative sources of information on Samba...
2006-01-07T11:37:00.000Z	MacXimain		the latest version of Samba is 3.0.21 ... the latest in the Repositories is 3.0.14
2006-01-07T11:38:00.000Z	MacXimain		i ran the live CD and the version there is 3.0.20
2006-01-07T11:39:00.000Z	MacXimain		it suppose to be enough
2006-01-07T11:39:00.000Z	MacXimain		so how do i build from that then??
2006-01-07T11:40:00.000Z	ColonelPanique	MacXimain	: have a look at Samba changes: http://us2.samba.org/samba/history/samba-3.0.21a.html  NO mention of any Mac OS X related issues going back to version 3.0.4 ;-)
2006-01-07T11:40:00.000Z	MacXimain		i need to add the dapper repositories right?
2006-01-07T11:42:00.000Z	MacXimain		I was reading this forum and it talks about it here
2006-01-07T11:42:00.000Z	MacXimain		http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=108691&highlight=samba
2006-01-07T11:43:00.000Z	MacXimain	topyli	 so what exactly do i need to add to have the repos
2006-01-07T11:45:00.000Z	MacXimain		ok kinda thought so but good to make sure
2006-01-07T11:45:00.000Z	ColonelPanique	MacXimain	: that forum says nothing about requiring the latest version of Samba...you don't really need it.  you should spare yourself the grief of trying to go to bleeding edge when you don't need it.
