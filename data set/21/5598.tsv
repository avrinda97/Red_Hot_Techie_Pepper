2007-09-17T12:19:00.000Z	Avulture		what is the importance of  the terminal in ubuntu ?
2007-09-17T12:19:00.000Z	Avulture		or in Linux Generally
2007-09-17T12:20:00.000Z	bruenig	Avulture	it is the most important thing if you wish to have any linux independence
2007-09-17T12:20:00.000Z	Avulture	bruenig	is it the same as Windows command prompt ?
2007-09-17T12:21:00.000Z	bruenig	Avulture	no.........................
2007-09-17T12:22:00.000Z	Avulture	bruenig	any good site for Linux beginners ?
2007-09-17T12:35:00.000Z	bruenig	Avulture	guis are front ends and they fail
2007-09-17T12:36:00.000Z	bruenig	Avulture	the point is this, what happens when the packaging overlords screw up and you boot and don't have a gui?
2007-09-17T12:36:00.000Z	bruenig	Avulture	as has happened before in ubuntu
2007-09-17T12:36:00.000Z	bruenig	Avulture	reinstall time for you if you don't know your way around the terminal
2007-09-17T12:36:00.000Z	Avulture	bruenig	i think you are right
2007-09-17T12:38:00.000Z	bruenig	Avulture	the terminal is far easier to do many many things and most who know it prefer it
2007-09-17T12:39:00.000Z	Avulture	bruenig	DO you think in the near future , OSes would still depend on terminals ?
2007-09-17T12:41:00.000Z	bruenig	Avulture	terminal commands is a bit misleading, a program can be run in the terminal, if you call that a command, than it is the number of programs that exist
2007-09-17T12:41:00.000Z	Avulture	bruenig	i meant general commands.. like for example Ping for windows
2007-09-17T12:43:00.000Z	Avulture	bruenig	 i even didn't try to use windows terminal if i lost my admin password
2007-09-17T12:52:00.000Z	Avulture	bruenig	 i read in wikipedia that , there is also hardware terminals
2007-09-17T12:53:00.000Z	bruenig	Avulture	maybe you mean tty or virtual consoles
2007-09-17T12:53:00.000Z	Avulture	bruenig	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal
2007-09-17T12:54:00.000Z	bruenig	Avulture	yeah that's fine, I don't know what you want
2007-09-17T12:55:00.000Z	Avulture	bruenig	do you think that voice commands could make terminals just old tenets?
