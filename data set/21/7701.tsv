2007-10-19T15:29:00.000Z	cwill1	hal9000	under intel, yes
2007-10-19T15:29:00.000Z	cwill1	hal9000	which?
2007-10-19T15:29:00.000Z	cwill1	hal9000	gotta use intel, the i810 driver won't be accelerated
2007-10-19T15:30:00.000Z	cwill1	hal9000	if xserver-xorg-video-intel doesn't work, you're out of luck for anything reasonably performing
2007-10-19T15:30:00.000Z	cwill1	hal9000	I know
2007-10-19T15:30:00.000Z	cwill1	hal9000	i810 isn't accelerated, so all the graphics are computed slowly by the cpu
2007-10-19T15:30:00.000Z	cwill1	hal9000	feisty or gutsy?
2007-10-19T15:31:00.000Z	cwill1	hal9000	then the particular chipset may not be able to display it accelerated

2007-10-19T15:34:00.000Z	hal9000	cwill1	have you seen?
2007-10-19T15:35:00.000Z	hal9000	cwill1	now i will try with the live
2007-10-19T15:35:00.000Z	cwill1	hal9000	you might need to set the ram explictly, but try the live cd
2007-10-19T15:36:00.000Z	cwill1	hal9000	videoram in the device section, ya
