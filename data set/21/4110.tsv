2008-07-18T13:41:00.000Z	Flannel	paul_5666	You don't fsck mounted harddrives
2008-07-18T13:42:00.000Z	Flannel	paul_5666	Yes
2008-07-18T13:45:00.000Z	Flannel	paul_5666	ntfs is the fs type, not ntfs-3g
2008-07-18T13:45:00.000Z	paul_5666	Flannel	how do i define that?
2008-07-18T13:45:00.000Z	Flannel	paul_5666	What command are you giving?
2008-07-18T13:46:00.000Z	Flannel	paul_5666	-t ntfs
2008-07-18T13:46:00.000Z	Flannel	paul_5666	If you don't specify a type, it guesses from your fstab, which is ntfs-3g
2008-07-18T13:46:00.000Z	paul_5666	Flannel	same error
2008-07-18T13:47:00.000Z	Flannel	paul_5666	What line are you using now?
2008-07-18T13:47:00.000Z	paul_5666	Flannel	fsck -p -f -t ntfs /media/windows_virtual
2008-07-18T13:48:00.000Z	Flannel	paul_5666	without sudo?
2008-07-18T13:48:00.000Z	paul_5666	Flannel	im root already
2008-07-18T13:49:00.000Z	Flannel	paul_5666	type fsck and hit tab twice, do you see fsck.ntfs?
2008-07-18T13:49:00.000Z	Flannel	paul_5666	I'm not really sure you can fsck an ntfs drive, now that I'm actually thinking.
2008-07-18T13:49:00.000Z	paul_5666	Flannel	nope dont see it
2008-07-18T13:50:00.000Z	Flannel	paul_5666	I imagine you can't fsck ntfs, which makes sense.  What are you trying to fix?
2008-07-18T13:50:00.000Z	paul_5666	Flannel	its just saying the ntfs journal did something
2008-07-18T13:51:00.000Z	Flannel	paul_5666	You'll probably wind up needing to boot windows and fix it.
2008-07-18T13:51:00.000Z	Flannel	paul_5666	"fix it" probably means clean shutdown.
2008-07-18T13:52:00.000Z	paul_5666	Flannel	ok
