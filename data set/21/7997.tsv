2008-03-30T00:59:00.000Z	Jero	ikonia	i cant find a driver for my wireless adapter
2008-03-30T00:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Jero	is it supported ?
2008-03-30T00:59:00.000Z	Jero	ikonia	i..dont know
2008-03-30T00:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Jero	what model is it
2008-03-30T01:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Jero	check the url from ubotu, see if it's listed as supported
2008-03-30T01:01:00.000Z	Jero	ikonia	ubotu?  (is a linux & irc noob)
2008-03-30T01:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Jero	you should have recieved a private message from ubotu
2008-03-30T01:02:00.000Z	Jero	ikonia	awesome, thanks
2008-03-30T01:04:00.000Z	Jero	ikonia	its not there
2008-03-30T01:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Jero	how about that url
2008-03-30T01:06:00.000Z	Jero	ikonia	nope, cant find it
2008-03-30T01:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Jero	Hmmm I don't know that card, so I don't know if it's supported, but it doesn't look good
2008-03-30T01:07:00.000Z	Jero	ikonia	sorry, its not a card..its an external usb adapter
2008-03-30T01:09:00.000Z	Jero	ikonia	sudo makemywirelesswork =P
2008-03-30T01:13:00.000Z	Jero	ikonia	so if its not on those lists, theres no way i can get it to work?  not even if i can find someone to write a driver?
2008-03-30T01:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Jero	no-one will "write a driver for you", it's not a 10 minute job
2008-03-30T01:14:00.000Z	Jero	ikonia	i know that...but there are those that may
2008-03-30T01:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Jero	there is not, if no driver exists, it's probably because it needs to be reverse engineered
2008-03-30T01:15:00.000Z	Jero	ikonia	ok...thanks for your help
