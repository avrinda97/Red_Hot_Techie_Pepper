2006-01-15T12:09:00.000Z	bipolar		is there a way to stop ssh from encrypting the ip/hostname in the known_hosts file?
2006-01-15T12:10:00.000Z	soundray	bipolar	I know what you mean, I see this in breezy, too.
2007-03-09T12:49:00.000Z	soundray	bipolar	is this a survey?
2007-03-09T12:49:00.000Z	bipolar	soundray	heh... no. I have this setup and I'm trying to get the full res out of it.
2007-03-09T12:50:00.000Z	soundray	bipolar	then you need to say something like 'I'm running an external display on card XY currently at 800x600 -- it should run at 1920x1200 -- how do I fix this?'
2007-03-09T12:51:00.000Z	soundray	bipolar	then someone will ask ubotu to tell you about fixres
2007-03-09T12:51:00.000Z	bipolar	soundray	HAHA
2007-03-09T12:52:00.000Z	bipolar	soundray	the problem is, I'm no noob, and I've tried a lot of thing to get this to work. I'm in the middle of reinstalling fglrx to see if it works in feisty.
2007-03-09T12:53:00.000Z	soundray	bipolar	apologies, but your question sounded extremely noobish ("anyone...")
2007-03-09T12:53:00.000Z	bipolar	soundray	I am going over that page though. maybe it has something I missed :)
2007-03-09T12:53:00.000Z	soundray	bipolar	go to #ubuntu+1 to ask about feisty please
2007-03-09T12:53:00.000Z	bipolar	soundray	I try to sound helpless so I get sympithy :)
2007-03-09T12:53:00.000Z	bipolar	soundray	I will. my main attempt was in edgy though.
2007-03-09T12:55:00.000Z	soundray	bipolar	in my experience, the questions that fetch the best answers are 'I'm trying this and that, but I hit this and that snag -- how to fix?' If you've read docs, mention which ones.
2007-03-09T12:55:00.000Z	bipolar	soundray	I'll do that next time. thanks. :)
2007-03-09T13:22:00.000Z	bipolar	soundray	can you tell ubotu to send me that link again please?
2007-03-09T13:22:00.000Z	soundray	bipolar	remind me
2007-03-09T13:22:00.000Z	bipolar	soundray	resolution problems
2007-03-09T13:23:00.000Z	bipolar	soundray	thanks :)
2007-03-16T07:14:00.000Z	soundray	bipolar	is that what -m connlimit is for?
2007-03-16T07:14:00.000Z	bipolar	soundray	I think so. I'd have to check the howto again
