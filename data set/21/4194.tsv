2008-07-11T20:29:00.000Z	Xavura		oh
2008-07-11T20:29:00.000Z	Xavura		yeah that's kind of what I need, how to pop up the menu with a keystroke
2008-07-11T20:29:00.000Z	Xavura		but for the TOP  menus I think you can use alt
2008-07-11T20:30:00.000Z	Xavura		yeah that works, in most apps anyway
2008-07-11T20:30:00.000Z	Xavura		say if I'm going through my music using the arrow keys
2008-07-11T20:30:00.000Z	Xavura		and I want to rename them, there's no way to trigger the right click menu without the mouse
2008-07-11T20:31:00.000Z	Xavura		Raskall_: err that looks like a menu? explain
2008-07-11T20:31:00.000Z	Xavura		err no just space, super, ctrl
2008-07-11T20:32:00.000Z	Xavura		ctrl super alt space alt super ctrl
2008-07-11T20:32:00.000Z	Xavura		Nobody know of a way to open right click menus with the keyboard
2008-07-11T20:32:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Xavura	The little button between alt and ctrl on the right side?
2008-07-15T22:00:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Xavura	sounds like something bad happened, maybe try ctrl+alt+f1 to switch tty and then dmesg | tail
2008-07-16T21:03:00.000Z	Xavura	ASULutzy	that's actually quite a good idea
2008-07-16T21:12:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Xavura	There's really no reason vesa shouldn't work (it won't give you 3d but it should work)
2008-07-16T21:15:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Xavura	When you set the driver to "vesa" in xorg.conf, that should definitely work, have you tried booting into failsafe gnome?
2008-07-16T21:15:00.000Z	Xavura	ASULutzy	Will that work for compiz fusion effects, someone said it has no 3d but I have had this card working beautifully, with compiz fusion and no display issues
2008-07-16T21:15:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Xavura	No, vesa won't work with compiz
2008-07-16T21:16:00.000Z	Xavura	ASULutzy	Then that isn't what I'm looking for, I'm looking for the one I had from the beginning (installation) that worked perfectly fine with no display issues
2008-07-16T21:16:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Xavura	What other drivers work for 3d on an ati card other than fglrx?
2008-07-16T21:17:00.000Z	Xavura	ASULutzy	Well, they all seem to work except one
2008-07-16T21:17:00.000Z	Xavura	ASULutzy	But they all have display issues
