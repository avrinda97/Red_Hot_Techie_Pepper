2007-02-16T10:27:00.000Z	GMWeezel		For some reason, only one sound application is allowed access to my audio i/o layer.
2007-02-16T10:27:00.000Z	GMWeezel		At a time to qualify it.
2007-02-16T10:28:00.000Z	GMWeezel		I get the problem with all apps.
2007-02-16T10:29:00.000Z	GMWeezel		Can I disable audio I/O locking?
2007-02-16T10:29:00.000Z	cables	GMWeezel	I just joined, but it sounds like your audio software is using OSS and not ALSA, which means only one can be used at a time.
2007-02-16T10:30:00.000Z	GMWeezel	cables	Can I force them to use ALSA?
2007-02-16T10:30:00.000Z	cables	GMWeezel	what programs are they?
2007-02-16T10:30:00.000Z	GMWeezel	cables	Flash, Audacity, YSFlight simulator, most games
2007-02-16T10:31:00.000Z	cables	GMWeezel	there's a program you can install that will put an OSS emulation wrapper around those programs to have them use ALSA.
2007-02-16T10:31:00.000Z	cables	GMWeezel	"sudo aptitude install alsa-oss"
2007-02-16T10:31:00.000Z	GMWeezel	cables	must it be configured for every single application or will it automatically wrap them all?
2007-02-16T10:32:00.000Z	cables	GMWeezel	you'll have to change the menu entries for those programs to have them run through it
2007-02-16T10:32:00.000Z	GMWeezel	cables	So it's probably not a sound card issue?
2007-02-16T10:32:00.000Z	cables	GMWeezel	you just need to run the app as "aoss <appname>". You can do that to test it, then change your menu entries to do that.
2007-02-16T10:32:00.000Z	cables	GMWeezel	definitely not a soundcard issue
2007-02-16T10:33:00.000Z	GMWeezel	cables	What about embedded applications like flash and java?
2007-02-16T10:34:00.000Z	cables	GMWeezel	those are stealing sound too? Are you using Flash 7?
2007-02-16T10:35:00.000Z	GMWeezel	cables	I don't have Java installed but when I am running flash, I can't run Audacity; I was just assuming Java since everything else does but flash 100% sure
2007-02-16T10:35:00.000Z	GMWeezel	cables	I need to check the version though; one moment
2007-02-16T10:36:00.000Z	GMWeezel	cables	Adobe Flash player 9 but anything I have run that plays sound except Gaim hogs my sound i/o layer.
2007-02-16T10:37:00.000Z	cables	GMWeezel	there's a way to get Firefox to use aoss for its sound. But hold on, Ubotu has a factoid about sound, and you may want to read that to see if anything solves your problems. Some apps will still need to use AOSS however.
