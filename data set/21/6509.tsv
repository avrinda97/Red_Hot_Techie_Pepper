2007-04-11T06:31:00.000Z	zbrown	ravi_master	you have your socket options setup on the server?
2007-04-11T06:32:00.000Z	zbrown	ravi_master	what version of ubuntu is the client?
2007-04-11T06:32:00.000Z	ravi_master	zbrown	3.0.22
2007-04-11T06:33:00.000Z	zbrown	ravi_master	no the ubuntu distro version (ie: 6.06 LTS, 6.10, 7.04)
2007-04-11T06:34:00.000Z	zbrown	ravi_master	in the [global]  sectin of the smb.conf, put the option "log level = 8"
2007-04-11T06:34:00.000Z	zbrown	ravi_master	if you want more detailed logs, ususally its set to 2, and can't be maximally set to 10
2007-04-11T06:34:00.000Z	ravi_master	zbrown	this is for the client side right?
2007-04-11T06:34:00.000Z	zbrown	ravi_master	whats the network infrastructure look like ravi_master ?
2007-04-11T06:34:00.000Z	zbrown	ravi_master	no, server side, in the case of windows, you'll need to check its errors, sorry i thought you were on Linux
2007-04-11T06:34:00.000Z	zbrown	ravi_master	err sorry i thought your server was linux for a minute
2007-04-11T06:35:00.000Z	ravi_master	zbrown	this setup is still working fine in between a laptop plugged into the same router as the windows server and ubuntu client
2007-04-11T06:35:00.000Z	ravi_master	zbrown	that laptop is running windows
2007-04-11T06:35:00.000Z	zbrown	ravi_master	well, either way, whats the network infrastructure?
2007-04-11T06:36:00.000Z	ravi_master	zbrown	ok, it's just a netgear router
2007-04-11T06:36:00.000Z	zbrown	ravi_master	full duplex?
2007-04-11T06:36:00.000Z	ravi_master	zbrown	yeah
2007-04-11T06:36:00.000Z	zbrown	ravi_master	hmmm, i'm not sure then, i've never dealt with samba clients. i generally serve via linux
2007-04-11T06:37:00.000Z	zbrown	ravi_master	check your server's logs though
2007-04-11T06:37:00.000Z	ravi_master	zbrown	hold on, seems like I get rx errors on a ping too
2007-04-11T06:37:00.000Z	ravi_master	zbrown	just didn't ping long enough
