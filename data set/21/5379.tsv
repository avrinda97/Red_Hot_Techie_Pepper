2007-10-25T19:13:00.000Z	blakeg	keito	what about using reiserfs instead of ext3? any problems?
2007-10-25T19:13:00.000Z	keito	blakeg	is it supported by windoze?
2007-10-25T19:14:00.000Z	blakeg	keito	im not sure, but is reiserfs any better than ext3?
2007-10-25T19:14:00.000Z	keito	blakeg	a tad more unstable (apparently) than ext3 though I've heard it still rocks
2007-10-25T19:14:00.000Z	blakeg	keito	for running linux
2007-10-25T19:14:00.000Z	keito	blakeg	see above!

2007-10-25T19:15:00.000Z	blakeg	keito	that works too... i just wondered since i thought i'd try a reiserfs system.. my data is all stored on an EXT3 formatted drive, but everything else is reiser

2007-10-25T19:17:00.000Z	keito		right I have a question, I just reformatted new external to ext3 using a livecd.  this is now owned by root as I ran gparted from termianl with sudo.  can I change (and should i) the owner/mod for the drive.  and how do I best go about it?
2007-10-25T19:17:00.000Z	blakeg	keito	sudo nautilus (if you have gnome installed) and then change the permissions for the directory/drive if need be
2007-10-25T19:18:00.000Z	keito	blakeg	much obliged
2007-10-25T19:18:00.000Z	keito	blakeg	thats a trick I can't believe I missed.  i could do it with the automatix nautilus scripts but I knew there was a better way.  that is it. danke
2007-10-25T19:20:00.000Z	blakeg	keito	np, i had to figger that one out myself when i was first starting out :)
