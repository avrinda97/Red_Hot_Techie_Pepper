2012-11-16T05:32:00.000Z	billybigrigger		is it possible for someone to help me out quick, my friend brought me a computer and his external hard disk, (his gf formatted the external with apple time machine) and i'm wondering if there's any ubuntu tools to recover the formatted windows partition?
2012-11-16T05:33:00.000Z	billybigrigger		is gparted's "Attempt Data Rescue.." going to cut it?
2012-11-16T05:33:00.000Z	bkc_	billybigrigger	that depends
2012-11-16T05:35:00.000Z	bkc_	billybigrigger	as I said, that depends :)
2012-11-16T05:38:00.000Z	bkc_	billybigrigger	that's good, now try "Attempt Data Rescue"
2012-11-16T05:41:00.000Z	billybigrigger	bkc_	ok, i ran it, any idea how long this takes?
2012-11-16T05:58:00.000Z	billybigrigger	bkc_	escott thanks, if your around when im back ill probably ping :P
2012-11-16T05:41:00.000Z	bkc_	billybigrigger	no idea... depends on a gazillion different things :)
2012-11-16T05:48:00.000Z	billybigrigger	bkc_	ok so how does gparted data recovery compare to some other "pro" recovery tools
2012-11-16T05:48:00.000Z	bkc_	billybigrigger	about the same or better...
2012-11-16T05:51:00.000Z	billybigrigger	bkc_	is it normal to still be "searching for file systems on /dev/sdc"
2012-11-16T05:52:00.000Z	bkc_	billybigrigger	As I said previously, it depends on a gazillion different things... it can take from a couple of minutes too a couple of days/weeks...
2012-11-16T05:53:00.000Z	bkc_	billybigrigger	yes, that's normal. and it's exactly like escott said :)
2012-11-16T05:53:00.000Z	bkc_	billybigrigger	and like I said, it depends on your setup...
2012-11-16T05:55:00.000Z	bkc_	billybigrigger	you also have too consider stull like poor usb-drivers, bad cables, crappy buffering, etc.etc.etc... :)
2012-11-16T05:55:00.000Z	billybigrigger	bkc_	i understand that
2012-11-16T06:00:00.000Z	bkc_	billybigrigger	just don't be supprised if it doesn't find anything thou... MBR->GPT and NTFS->whatever-apple-uses is quite destructive sometimes...
2012-11-16T06:27:00.000Z	billybigrigger	bkc_	escott is it safe to stop gparted's data recovery?
2012-11-16T06:27:00.000Z	bkc_	billybigrigger	yes
2012-11-16T06:27:00.000Z	billybigrigger	bkc_	aware of any log i can tail -f to see any actual progress?
2012-11-16T06:30:00.000Z	bkc_	billybigrigger	no logs, and I'm farily sure that gparted won't help (as the actual partition-info is probably overwritten). however there are applications (free & non-free) for retreiving different types of files (e.g. photos, music, etc.) but those take TIME too run through... especially on such a large disk :)
