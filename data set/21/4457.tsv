2011-07-04T22:36:00.000Z	moonchild		hey guys, I have a question about fakeraid on an x58 chipset
2011-07-04T22:36:00.000Z	ikonia	moonchild	don't use it
2011-07-04T22:37:00.000Z	ikonia	moonchild	unwise
2011-07-04T22:38:00.000Z	ikonia	moonchild	no, fakeraid has terrible support under linux, which is the most likley issue, it can't see the partition table
2011-07-04T22:39:00.000Z	moonchild	ikonia	the OS actually can
2011-07-04T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	moonchild	then what's your question ?
2011-07-04T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	moonchild	what partition table is it using, ms dos or gpt ?
2011-07-04T22:41:00.000Z	moonchild	ikonia	at this point, whatever win7 tried to do
2011-07-04T22:41:00.000Z	ikonia	moonchild	I suspect that fact that it's complaining means it can't see the partition table on the meta device
2011-07-04T22:41:00.000Z	ikonia	moonchild	fdisk -l will listed it
2011-07-04T22:42:00.000Z	moonchild	ikonia	mind if we take this to pm?
2011-07-04T22:42:00.000Z	ikonia	moonchild	I don't see a reason to
2011-07-04T22:43:00.000Z	ikonia	moonchild	I won't talk to you until you return
2011-07-04T22:45:00.000Z	moonchild	ikonia	looks like fdisk is thoroughly confused
2011-07-04T22:45:00.000Z	ikonia	moonchild	probably because it can't read the partition table due to the meta device not being supported, as fakeraid sucks
2011-07-04T22:54:00.000Z	ikonia	moonchild	it can't read the partition table
2011-07-04T22:54:00.000Z	ikonia	moonchild	certainly not
2011-07-04T23:46:00.000Z	moonchild	ikonia	still here?
2011-07-04T23:47:00.000Z	ikonia	moonchild	yes
2011-07-04T23:48:00.000Z	ikonia	moonchild	no problem, big topic,
2011-07-04T23:49:00.000Z	ikonia	moonchild	I advised against that, but "ok"
