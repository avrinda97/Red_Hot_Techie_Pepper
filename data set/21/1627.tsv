2011-02-17T20:06:00.000Z	delinquentme		so ive got some firefox weirdness going on .. basically it says its already running .. when i dont have a ff screen to play with
2011-02-17T20:06:00.000Z	delinquentme		so .. how do i kill it all and start over .. or are there other options like a task manager
2011-02-17T20:08:00.000Z	milamber	delinquentme	you can also try:  ps aux | grep firefox
2011-02-17T20:09:00.000Z	delinquentme	milamber	that looks bamf
2011-02-17T20:10:00.000Z	milamber	delinquentme	glad you like it. did you find your process id?
2011-02-17T20:11:00.000Z	milamber	delinquentme	does the process hang or does it not return anything? does it dump you back at the prompt?
2011-02-17T20:12:00.000Z	delinquentme	milamber	doesnt return anything and doesnt return me to prompt
2011-02-17T20:13:00.000Z	milamber	delinquentme	try just: ps aux
2011-02-17T20:14:00.000Z	delinquentme	milamber	it comes up there!
2011-02-17T20:14:00.000Z	milamber	delinquentme	ok: kill -9 <processid>
2011-02-17T20:15:00.000Z	delinquentme	milamber	do i need to exit that to the prompt first?
2011-02-17T20:16:00.000Z	delinquentme	milamber	exited it .. tried it .. returned me ot prompt
2011-02-17T20:17:00.000Z	milamber	delinquentme	ps aux should just list what processes are running and dump you back to the prompt. what you really need is the process id (PID) of firefox. when you did the ps aux did you see firefox?
2011-02-17T20:18:00.000Z	delinquentme	milamber	so thje PID was 2101
2011-02-17T20:22:00.000Z	milamber	delinquentme	. . . how are things going?
2011-02-17T20:31:00.000Z	delinquentme	milamber	im just gonna reboot :D but thanks for you time very very much :D
2011-02-17T20:31:00.000Z	milamber	delinquentme	any time. sorry i couldn't be more help.
2011-12-17T21:13:00.000Z	milamber	delinquentme	you can use the bot: msg ubottu !info <packagename>
2011-12-17T21:14:00.000Z	milamber	delinquentme	with a / in front of the msg
2011-12-17T21:16:00.000Z	delinquentme	milamber	awesome workaround :D
2012-04-21T06:12:00.000Z	milamber	delinquentme	how did you install it?
