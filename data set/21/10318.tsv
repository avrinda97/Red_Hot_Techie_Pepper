2005-04-06T14:03:00.000Z	saik0		OK I have to ask again, If windows is on /dev/hda5 then I should point grub to (hd2,4) correct?
2005-04-06T14:03:00.000Z	eyequeue	saik0	 you are sure it's not 0,4 ?
2005-04-06T14:03:00.000Z	saik0	eyequeue	how would I tell?
2005-04-06T14:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	saik0	 woulnd't 2.4 mean the fith partition on the third physical drive?  that wouldn't be hda, that would be hdc
2005-04-06T14:05:00.000Z	saik0	eyequeue	I made a mistake, I meant hdc5
2005-04-06T14:05:00.000Z	saik0	eyequeue	It's a laptop, the HD is recognized as hdc for some reason
2005-04-06T14:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	saik0	 hdc5 would be 2,4, yes
2005-04-06T14:06:00.000Z	saik0	eyequeue	crap, well then something else is broke
2005-04-06T15:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	saik0	 i seem to think i'm connected to the internet here
2005-04-06T15:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	saik0	 can you ping by ip number?
2005-04-06T15:44:00.000Z	saik0	eyequeue	I sure can, I've pinged my router
2005-04-06T15:45:00.000Z	eyequeue	saik0	 dhcp involved?
2005-04-06T15:45:00.000Z	saik0	eyequeue	correct
2005-04-06T15:45:00.000Z	eyequeue	saik0	 system > administration > networking
2005-04-06T15:46:00.000Z	eyequeue	saik0	 look under dns
2005-04-06T15:46:00.000Z	eyequeue	saik0	 then try pinging each server there by ip address
2005-04-06T15:46:00.000Z	saik0	eyequeue	the only IP there is the router IP
2005-04-06T15:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	saik0	 okay, there's the problem, the router is not telling you your isp's dns servers
2005-04-06T15:48:00.000Z	saik0	eyequeue	well tats not good at all, how do I fix this
2005-04-06T15:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	saik0	 first off, i'd check into what is wrong with the router, but may i /msg you?
2005-04-06T15:49:00.000Z	saik0	eyequeue	yep /msg away
