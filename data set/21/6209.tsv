2007-05-10T05:18:00.000Z	jlu	kitche	its not the codecs. i lack hardware accelleration. and with beryl it's even worse.
2007-05-10T05:19:00.000Z	jlu	kitche	everything looks like crap. especially in full-screen.
2007-05-10T05:19:00.000Z	kitche	jlu	then don't use beryl
2007-05-10T05:20:00.000Z	kitche	jlu	beryl/compiz still ahevs oem problems with playing videos among other multimedia things
2007-05-10T05:21:00.000Z	jlu	kitche	hehe, yeah, well. i guess i could get rid of beryl (even though it was acctually what made me go ubuntu). but, even if i do, things do not work properly. in mplayer it works somewhat better than in totem, but there's still problems with motion.
2007-05-10T05:21:00.000Z	kitche	jlu	what's your video card?
2007-05-10T05:21:00.000Z	jlu	kitche	i915
2007-05-10T05:22:00.000Z	kitche	jlu	that should have hardware acceleration
2007-05-10T05:24:00.000Z	kitche	jlu	yeah see XGL actually takes away hardware acceleration but think your probably using AIGLX which comes with X
2007-05-10T05:24:00.000Z	kitche	jlu	what does glxinfo|grep rendering tell you in a terminal
2007-05-10T05:25:00.000Z	jlu	kitche	without beryl running it says "direct rendering Yes"
2007-05-10T05:27:00.000Z	jlu	kitche	i while back when i was messing with this someone told me to configure gstreamer using some command i cant remember to use "vx".
2007-05-10T05:33:00.000Z	jlu	kitche	you don't happen to know the command for changing video output in totem? there was some special program that had to be run, not like mplayer where you can change things from within the program...
2007-05-10T05:34:00.000Z	kitche	jlu	nope but it's probably -nv maybe or xv added to the totem command
2007-05-10T05:35:00.000Z	jlu	kitche	it was gstreamer-config or something... hmm. thanks anyway...
2007-05-10T05:35:00.000Z	jlu	kitche	:)
2007-05-10T05:35:00.000Z	kitche	jlu	well it all depends on what totem is using sicne it can use gstreamer or xine think my way is the xine way
2007-05-10T05:36:00.000Z	jlu	kitche	would you say xine is better (to me it's just another acronym.. :) )
2007-05-10T05:36:00.000Z	kitche	jlu	it might be but myself I use vlc since it handles everything that I want
2007-05-10T05:39:00.000Z	jlu	kitche	i've tried vlc too. under beryl it crashes like a plane from an hezbollah conference.
