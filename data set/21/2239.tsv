2009-11-30T00:25:00.000Z	Zabbadahu		has anybody run into an installation issue where the HDD does not register when trying to boot from the disk?
2009-11-30T00:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zabbadahu	when you are in the live CD run: dmesg | less     and read
2009-11-30T00:28:00.000Z	Zabbadahu	ActionParsnip	Thanks will check that out
2009-11-30T01:09:00.000Z	Zabbadahu	ActionParsnip	I finally got into live and ran dmesg | less
2009-11-30T01:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zabbadahu	cool, what does it say about the PATA / SATA controller
2009-11-30T01:12:00.000Z	Zabbadahu	ActionParsnip	looking it is a big list lol
2009-11-30T01:12:00.000Z	Zabbadahu	ActionParsnip	I also burned an alternate install just incase it is a raid issue
2009-11-30T01:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zabbadahu	yes, its your system loading. read what it says
2009-11-30T01:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zabbadahu	you may also want to run: sudo fdisk -l    to see what partitions can be seen
2009-11-30T01:14:00.000Z	Zabbadahu	ActionParsnip	yes it was not coming up with anything last night with the i386 version
2009-11-30T01:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zabbadahu	ok do the controllers get detected and are the drives seen in the dmesg output
2009-11-30T01:19:00.000Z	Zabbadahu	ActionParsnip	 I found one it says ata1: SATA Link up 3.0 Gbps (SStatus 123 Scontrol 300)
2009-11-30T01:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zabbadahu	ok does it give it a disk name like sda
2009-11-30T01:21:00.000Z	Zabbadahu	ActionParsnip	no it is giving an error ata1.00: failed to IDENTIFY (I/O error, err_mask=0x4)
2009-11-30T01:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zabbadahu	there is your issue, websearch for that to see what it means
2009-11-30T01:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zabbadahu	your drive may need boot options or it may be failing, the websearch will show you. You could also default the BIOS to failsafe options
2009-11-30T01:23:00.000Z	Zabbadahu	ActionParsnip	the drive is currently 100% NTFS with XP on it that boots fine
2009-11-30T01:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zabbadahu	the websearch will show you whats going on
2009-11-30T01:36:00.000Z	Zabbadahu	ActionParsnip	 found some info need to research
2009-11-30T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zabbadahu	have fun fellah
2009-11-30T01:37:00.000Z	Zabbadahu	ActionParsnip	not likely it says it may be a bridge chipset problem I need to research the mobo specs and see if that is the problem
