2008-07-11T14:31:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	what part of ubuntu do you want to update
2008-07-11T14:31:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	if the error is a few lines long, please use a pastebin
2008-07-11T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	what done to your system - why is it looking in /usr/local/lib
2008-07-11T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	have you compiled anything by source
2008-07-11T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	did you do "make install" on anything ?
2008-07-11T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	yes, build-essential
2008-07-11T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	did you compile anything from source
2008-07-11T14:34:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	it looks like you've some how managed to like some of the libraries the package manager wants to use to non-existant libraries in /usr/local
2008-07-11T14:34:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	I can't quite see how you've done that though
2008-07-11T14:35:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	what else did you do "make install" on
2008-07-11T14:35:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	ok - now we are getting some where
2008-07-11T14:35:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	vmware did not need you to compile gcc
2008-07-11T14:36:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	well, it looks like you've messed up your libraries pretty good. The quickest and easiest way to resolve this is to re-install ubuntu and get help before messing up your system, we can help you do the things you want properly
2008-07-11T14:37:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	if you tell us what you want to do on your clean system we can help and explain what we are doing and why
2008-07-11T14:38:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	I'm around most of the time
2008-07-11T14:38:00.000Z	ikonia	simon_	and plenty of others in here can help
