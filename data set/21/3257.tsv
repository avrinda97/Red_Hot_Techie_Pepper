2009-05-08T07:22:00.000Z	syntax\	vimpulse	i was wondering if deleting /host and breaking that partition would cause my system to fail.
2009-05-08T07:22:00.000Z	vimpulse	syntax\	 what partition is /host on?  what fs type?  try:  ls -l /host && stat /host
2009-05-08T07:23:00.000Z	syntax\	vimpulse	what do you wanna see?
2009-05-08T07:24:00.000Z	vimpulse	syntax\	 ls -l /host && stat /host && mount
2009-05-08T07:26:00.000Z	syntax\	vimpulse	/dev/sda2 on /host type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,user_id=0,group_id=0,allow_other,blksize=4096)
2009-05-08T07:26:00.000Z	vimpulse	syntax\	 ps -ef | grep -i ntfs
2009-05-08T07:27:00.000Z	syntax\	vimpulse	its not an ntfs partition as i see it..
2009-05-08T07:27:00.000Z	vimpulse	syntax\	 ls -l /host && stat /host
2009-05-08T07:28:00.000Z	syntax\	vimpulse	http://pastebin.com/d658ab696
2009-05-08T07:29:00.000Z	vimpulse	syntax\	 looks like NTFS or fat32.  probably NTFS.
2009-05-08T07:29:00.000Z	syntax\	vimpulse	you think i can delete it without harming the system?
2009-05-08T07:35:00.000Z	syntax\	vimpulse	was able to figure it out, anyways i can't delete /host
