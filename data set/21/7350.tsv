2006-12-26T08:56:00.000Z	gregcha117		can anybody help me out ?
2006-12-26T08:57:00.000Z	gregcha117		I'm in need of some help from somoene.... i was in the middle of downloading a dvd on my mounted windows drive, and apparently i ran out of space, i tryed deleting some files and realized they just disappeared but no space was freed up and now i cant start windows and the mounted drive disappeared :| anyone know how to fix this?
2006-12-26T08:58:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	your windows partition is fat32 i take it?
2006-12-26T08:58:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	you have fuse setup on ubuntu then?
2006-12-26T09:00:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	ok...  so you mounted the ntfs partition as read/write (probably using fuse or the like) and when it filled up, it just de-mounted, and now windows won't boot at all.  is that correct?
2006-12-26T09:01:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	I almost hate to say this... but you might be fscked.  :(  i have yet to toy with the rw stuff for NTFS, as there's warnings all over the place that it can cause problems.  I'm betting something got overwritten in the FS and the table is borked.  there should be an fsck.ntfs installed along with the fuse tools, might try running that on the partition.
2006-12-26T09:03:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	so long as fsck.ntfs got installed, you should be able to do this:  sudo fsck -C -f /dev/mountpointofntfsdrive
2006-12-26T09:06:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	no, what was the actual mount point (like /dev/hda1 or something)?
2006-12-26T09:08:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	sounds like you need another package along with it.  along with that ntfs-3g stuff, did you add a repo to your system, or was it just a single .deb file you downloaded?
2006-12-26T09:09:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	right... when you installed it, did you add a repository to do so, or did you just download a .deb file and go?
2006-12-26T09:11:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	ok, so you added a repository.  you might just need to run another apt-get line to get the fsck util
2006-12-26T09:14:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	ok, it looks like the package you'll need is ntfsprogs.  sudo apt-get install ntfstools
2006-12-26T09:16:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	sudo fsck -C -f /dev/hda1 (or whatever the device name was)
2006-12-26T09:17:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	try it directly:  sudo fsck.ntfs -C -f /dev/devicepoint
2006-12-26T09:18:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	after that, i don't know what to tell you, unfortunatly :(
2006-12-26T09:19:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	only thing I can say is for future refrence:  use windows to write into ext3, do not use linux to write into ntfs.  sorry I don't have better advice.  might be best to throw it back into the chatroom though (restate your question again), and see if anyone else has a better suggestion/solution
2006-12-26T09:21:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	sorry :(
2006-12-26T09:47:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	ok... were you able to clear some space on that drive then?
2006-12-26T10:04:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	it drops them into .Trash-<username>.  you can empty it by right clicking the icon in the lower right corner :)
2006-12-26T10:06:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	show hidden files on the partition you're working on, and check for a .Trash-<username> folder.  they should be in there.  you can delete them from a command prompt if need be.
2006-12-26T10:10:00.000Z	SilentDis	gregcha117	the trash 'folder' on the drive is the 'regular' trash bin.  that's how nautilus works (it's normal behavior).  you can enable an option to 'permanantly delete' under nautilus, but I'd recommend against it, you can hose yourself pretty good without a saftey net.  never a bad idea to have a 'plan b', which is what that trash thing does ;)
