2011-06-26T21:36:00.000Z	weokoh		hi everyone, i know this is probably off topic as it should belong to #sanitarium  or #ucrazybro  but I would like to ask some questions about ubuntu (perhaps this involves Linux in general)  and web browsing, I'm well aware i should leave the windows mindset and worry less since Linux is more secure and less prone to "you click you get owned" stuff but recently i have started to supply a web browsing service (internet point wannabe) to people that aren't t
2011-06-26T21:36:00.000Z	weokoh		hat aware of scam sites viruses and so, even though its hard to get a virus on Linux could anyone suggest me some ways to make it harder for any potential threat coming from the web (please note i say web as web pages, not usb keys and all that) while using firefox? many thanks in advance to anyone who could save my lil brain from this paranoia lol
2011-06-26T21:38:00.000Z	sudokill	weokoh	look at apparmor
2011-06-26T21:38:00.000Z	weokoh	sudokill	did it, im enforcing the firefox default profile, could you give me some informations about it please? what it protects what no? on various forums i read the "default one" is not enough
2011-06-26T21:39:00.000Z	weokoh	sudokill	would you suggest anything else?
2011-06-26T21:39:00.000Z	sudokill	weokoh	youd need to look at apparmor threads, you can restirct the program how you like e.g only let it write to your downloads folder etc etc
2011-06-26T21:40:00.000Z	sudokill	weokoh	what r u actually afraid of? itshould be fine even without apaprmor
2011-06-26T21:40:00.000Z	weokoh	sudokill	do you know what would be the worst thing that may happen using that setup?
2011-06-26T21:41:00.000Z	sudokill	weokoh	if apparmor is set up good then i doubt much could happen at all
2011-06-26T21:42:00.000Z	weokoh	sudokill	what you mean by setup good? i only enforced the ubuntu profile
2011-06-26T21:42:00.000Z	sudokill	weokoh	imo your being too paranoid, the fact you cant get viruses on linux is a major security bonus over windows as it is
2011-06-26T21:43:00.000Z	weokoh	sudokill	your opinion is shared by me too, im way too paranoid lol
2011-06-26T21:44:00.000Z	weokoh	sudokill	you think i would have major advantages using grsecurity? can you briefly (i dont want to flood the channel with our convo) list some of its advantages?
2011-06-26T21:44:00.000Z	sudokill	weokoh	it depends, what do you do? just browse the web? grsecurity has a lot of features... randomization etc
2011-06-26T21:45:00.000Z	weokoh	sudokill	just browse the web, no servers if thats the question
2011-06-26T21:46:00.000Z	weokoh	sudokill	what you mean "im into security"
2011-06-26T21:46:00.000Z	weokoh	sudokill	yeah that was a dumb question lol, i meant to ask, you do anything "more" than what you suggested?
2011-06-26T21:47:00.000Z	weokoh	sudokill	i dumped windows in 2003 because of antiviruses, didnt want to think something so crappy was running with admin privileges LOL
2011-06-26T21:48:00.000Z	weokoh	sudokill	 dr_willis: thank you very much for all the info, much much much appreciated :D
2011-06-26T21:48:00.000Z	weokoh	sudokill	 dr_willis: next is calling the sanitarium and lock me in
2011-06-26T21:51:00.000Z	weokoh	sudokill	being a lil more paranoid than what reality offers (yet i never seen a linux user getting harmed by a website, and many claim that they go on adult ones LOL) would you say that my setup is fine for now? i may take some time to grub documentation but they ll keep using internet and go on malware filled (i suppose only for windows but the js is a cross platform threat) sites
