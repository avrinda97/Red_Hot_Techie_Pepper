2006-12-30T13:39:00.000Z	ken		HELP: My Ubuntu boot-up is very slow, so i de-activated the splash screen to check where it was taking a long time, and i discovered that at the command "configuring network interfaces..." Ubuntu gets freezed up for quite some time 20-25seconds. What do i do to get this right?
2006-12-30T13:39:00.000Z	harrisony1	ken	how you connect to intenet

2006-12-30T13:40:00.000Z	ken	harrisony1	i ran "sudo pppoeconf" the first time, to make sure that Ubuntu automatically connects to the net without asking me anythying everytime i start it

2006-12-30T13:47:00.000Z	ken	harrisony1	But theres only one wired connection (my current ADSL) on, whats the use of disabling the only (single) and working Internet connection

2006-12-30T17:54:00.000Z	ken	harrisony1	I want kde, but if i install kde-desktop than kde's apps show in GNOME and vice versa, but if i dont want all that clutter, i.e. if select kde, than only kde apps, and if i select GNOME only GNOME apps, is there some way to do that?
2006-12-30T17:55:00.000Z	harrisony1	ken	get a kubuntu cd and dual boot ubuntu and kubuntu only way i can think
