2009-12-11T22:31:00.000Z	ciphergoth	livingdaylight	you want ubuntu-de and you shouldn't ask to ask, just ask - see the toppic
2009-12-11T22:34:00.000Z	ciphergoth	livingdaylight	what do you mean "I can only do memtest"?
2009-12-11T22:35:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ciphergoth	: it won't let me choose rescue mode
2009-12-11T22:35:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ciphergoth	and i can't choose rescue mode iwth previous kernel
2009-12-11T22:36:00.000Z	ciphergoth	livingdaylight	so the option you want is visible, but you can't highlight it?
2009-12-11T22:37:00.000Z	ciphergoth	livingdaylight	please don't do that again
2009-12-11T22:37:00.000Z	ciphergoth	livingdaylight	have you tried a different keyboard
2009-12-11T22:37:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ciphergoth	no
2009-12-11T22:37:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ciphergoth	: what makes you think it is the keyboard?
2009-12-11T22:37:00.000Z	ciphergoth	livingdaylight	explains both noise and cursor behaviour
2009-12-11T22:38:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ciphergoth	: noise is a rapid tuttuttuttutututt sound (not beep - tut)
2009-12-11T22:39:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ciphergoth	After i swith on it makes the sound like some old arcade game... tuctuctuc tuc...
2009-12-11T22:40:00.000Z	ciphergoth	livingdaylight	does the cursor still move by itself with the new keyboard?.#
2009-12-11T22:40:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ciphergoth	ok i just rebooted... i am in GNUGRUB   and i cannot use keyboard to move
2009-12-11T22:41:00.000Z	ciphergoth	livingdaylight	this is with a different keyboard?
2009-12-11T22:41:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ciphergoth	no, keyboard is not flashing around now
2009-12-11T22:41:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ciphergoth	same
2009-12-11T22:41:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ciphergoth	i think it was flashing around when i was still 'online'
2009-12-11T22:41:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ciphergoth	i missrememberd... what is happening in grub is that i am on Memory test and cant scroll up with arrows to other linux gerneic pae options
2009-12-11T22:42:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ciphergoth	why would computer make beep sounds because of keyboard? makes no sense
