2006-09-16T15:54:00.000Z	__krugger__	mad_man	just don't delete the partition where the grub files are in :)
2006-09-16T15:57:00.000Z	mad_man	__krugger__	and QTParted will do the trick for deleting a partition ?
2006-09-16T15:58:00.000Z	__krugger__	mad_man	think so though I have never used it
2006-09-16T15:59:00.000Z	mad_man	__krugger__	any orther suggestions for a program that i can have a look see for this job ?
2006-09-16T16:00:00.000Z	__krugger__	mad_man	I usually use fdisk to delete, but parted or any other can do it
2006-09-16T16:00:00.000Z	__krugger__	mad_man	you are not trying to resize are you?
2006-09-16T16:00:00.000Z	mad_man	__krugger__	thank you for your help and input
2006-09-17T16:02:00.000Z	mad_man	__krugger__	yes/no/maybe i wood like to delete a partiton and add that to another partition with a o/s on it. can this be done ?
2006-09-17T16:03:00.000Z	__krugger__	mad_man	if the partition you are adding is after the partition with the OS it might work
2006-09-17T16:04:00.000Z	__krugger__	mad_man	as the superbloc has to be in the start of the partition
2006-09-17T16:05:00.000Z	mad_man	__krugger__	partiton is before.
2006-09-17T16:06:00.000Z	__krugger__	mad_man	than you probably will have trouble joining them
2006-09-17T16:08:00.000Z	mad_man	__krugger__	more trouble thans it's worth then ? no rush here | i will do some reading on this matter
2006-09-17T16:09:00.000Z	__krugger__	mad_man	most partitions can be increased by pulling the end, I don't think you can mess witht he start
2006-09-17T16:09:00.000Z	__krugger__	mad_man	but maybe there are ways I don't know about :)
2006-09-17T16:10:00.000Z	mad_man	__krugger__	maybe there is a way to have a partition jump over to the rear of a nother partition :-)
2006-09-17T16:12:00.000Z	__krugger__	mad_man	you don't seem to have a boot partition. If it is only data you could send all the files to another place and delete both partitions to make a big one.
2006-09-17T16:12:00.000Z	__krugger__	mad_man	and then copy the data back
