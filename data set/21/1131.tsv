2011-01-27T13:22:00.000Z	gunndawg		Hey Gnea!
2011-01-27T13:23:00.000Z	Gnea	gunndawg	yo
2011-01-28T16:46:00.000Z	Gnea	gunndawg	if you think you can help, feel free to jump in :)
2011-01-29T14:30:00.000Z	Gnea	gunndawg	make sure you're downloading for the correct version of gnome
2011-01-29T15:04:00.000Z	Gnea	gunndawg	give him the direct url to the theme you're referencing
2011-01-29T15:04:00.000Z	Gnea	gunndawg	and don't mess with ikonia :)
2011-01-29T15:05:00.000Z	Gnea	gunndawg	show us the direct URL for one that actually failed for you
2011-01-29T15:16:00.000Z	Gnea	gunndawg	don't open the file, just drag it from the download location
2011-01-29T15:18:00.000Z	Gnea	gunndawg	can you open a terminal and type ls -l in the downloads folder?
2011-01-29T15:21:00.000Z	Gnea	gunndawg	try logging out/logging in
2011-01-31T14:23:00.000Z	Gnea	gunndawg	oddly enough, a #weechat does exist :)
2011-01-31T14:24:00.000Z	gunndawg	Gnea	yeah but they offered only "read the FAQ" which I did look over
2011-01-31T14:24:00.000Z	Gnea	gunndawg	then tell them the FAQ didn't cover it
2011-01-31T14:25:00.000Z	gunndawg	Gnea	based off prior experience (not saying all) with trying to get ubuntu help on irc I'll get the response "look harder"
2011-01-31T14:25:00.000Z	gunndawg	Gnea	instead of actual help
2011-01-31T14:26:00.000Z	Gnea	gunndawg	keep in mind that the help you're looking for is with a specific application, which could be ran from slackware or redhat, thus it is distribution independent and the help channel for that application is the best place to ask, even if some of the people there aren't knowledgable
2011-02-03T15:05:00.000Z	gunndawg	Gnea	hey can I PM you ?
2011-02-03T15:06:00.000Z	Gnea	gunndawg	k
2011-02-10T13:10:00.000Z	Gnea	gunndawg	hi
2011-02-10T13:31:00.000Z	gunndawg	Gnea	May I PM you?
2011-02-10T13:50:00.000Z	gunndawg	Gnea	you around ?
