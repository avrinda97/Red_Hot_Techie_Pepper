2006-12-10T11:32:00.000Z	nn		but it irritates teh crap out of me
2006-12-10T11:33:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	nn	shut off bluetooth on your phone
2006-12-10T11:33:00.000Z	nn	nolimitsoya	yea, i kinda need that or i cant talk to people
2006-12-10T11:33:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	nn	can you necrypt it?
2006-12-10T11:34:00.000Z	nn	nolimitsoya	it's only to things it's peered with before
2006-12-16T07:13:00.000Z	nn	nolimitsoya	great but that wont run on a sidekick or in an ssh session
2006-12-24T14:23:00.000Z	nn	nolimitsoya	nooo
2006-12-25T07:33:00.000Z	nn	nolimitsoya	no, that's a driver issue
2006-12-25T07:33:00.000Z	nn	nolimitsoya	seems to be a chipset bug
2006-12-25T07:33:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	nn	i cant match that to things working in the live environment
2006-12-25T07:34:00.000Z	nn	nolimitsoya	Different driver maybe being loaded
2006-12-25T07:34:00.000Z	nn	nolimitsoya	there's a good possibility it's a tulip or ne2k clone
2006-12-25T07:34:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	nn	that might be the case, but id start with the simple and obvious before going exotic...
2006-12-25T07:35:00.000Z	nn	nolimitsoya	NETDEV WATCHDOG timeouts are usually buggy chipsets
2006-12-25T07:41:00.000Z	nn	nolimitsoya	i for some reason suspected it was an old realtek
2006-12-25T07:41:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	nn	and right you where :)
2006-12-25T07:49:00.000Z	nn	nolimitsoya	is there a /proc entry showing what driver is loaded for say 'eth0'?
2006-12-25T07:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	nn	should be. i havent a clue as the where though :)
2006-12-25T07:50:00.000Z	nn	nolimitsoya	heh i've not touched linux until recently for over 2 years
2006-12-25T07:50:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	nn	i just began last year :)
