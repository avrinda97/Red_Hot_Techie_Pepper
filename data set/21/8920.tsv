2006-01-20T12:30:00.000Z	j2daosh		its telling me its a not a directory....
2006-01-20T12:31:00.000Z	j2daosh		this is wrong with my command line seveas?  sudo mount -o loop /hda1/FANTASTIC_FOUR_169.ISO /media/cd-rom2
2006-01-20T12:32:00.000Z	j2daosh		its just what i call the drectory... not really a cd-rom
2006-01-20T12:33:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	j2daosh	: mplayer /hda1/FANTASTIC_FOUR_169.ISO -ovc copy -oac copy -of mpeg -noskip would dump it for you into mpeg2 (chances are it would)
2006-01-20T12:33:00.000Z	j2daosh		still didn't work
2006-01-20T12:33:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	j2daosh	: use mencoder not mplayer
2006-01-20T12:34:00.000Z	j2daosh		yeah but how do i mount that file though
2006-01-20T12:34:00.000Z	j2daosh		lol dont make me say why
2006-01-20T12:36:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	j2daosh	: if you use mencoder on it you dont need to mount it and the resulting file should work in any media player
2006-01-20T12:37:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	j2daosh	: i think its a ufs file system though, try mount with -t ufs ?
2006-01-20T12:38:00.000Z	j2daosh	lsuactiafner	im not trying to just watch it.... lol why would i be wanting to mount it ::hint hint::

2006-01-20T12:39:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	j2daosh	: if you want to encode it use mencoder with better options then
2006-01-20T12:40:00.000Z	j2daosh	lsuactiafner	ok... im trying to burn it to a disc... i need to mount it to use dvdshrink
