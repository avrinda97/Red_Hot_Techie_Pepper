2008-09-28T05:35:00.000Z	ibkanat		why would my new computer connect to the internet direct through the cable modem but wont work with the router
2008-09-28T05:35:00.000Z	ibkanat		it is gigabit
2008-09-28T05:36:00.000Z	ibkanat		wont ping through but connect ubuntu up to the cable modem and it works like a dream
2008-09-28T05:36:00.000Z	ibkanat		other computers running ubuntu on the next work work fibe
2008-09-28T05:37:00.000Z	ibkanat		no network experts
2008-09-28T05:37:00.000Z	ibkanat		even tried ethtool -s eth0 speed 100
2008-09-28T05:37:00.000Z	kitche	ibkanat	sounds like a dead port on the router
2008-09-28T05:38:00.000Z	ibkanat	kitche	no works on other computer just pop out the cable and plug it in
2008-09-28T05:38:00.000Z	kitche	ibkanat	then it should work on the computer that is having issues since it sounds like a router issue
2008-09-28T05:38:00.000Z	ibkanat		but ifconfig shows no rx tx
2008-09-28T05:38:00.000Z	kitche	ibkanat	does the computer in question have its ethernet seen>?
2008-09-28T05:39:00.000Z	ibkanat		how do I check?
2008-09-28T05:39:00.000Z	kitche	ibkanat	ifconfig -a you should see eth0 or something close to it
2008-09-28T05:39:00.000Z	ibkanat		yeah eth0
2008-09-28T05:39:00.000Z	ibkanat		I assigned a static ip
2008-09-28T05:40:00.000Z	ibkanat		and the gateway is set but the router cant see it and wont communicate no pings even
2008-09-28T05:40:00.000Z	kitche	ibkanat	well sounds like it's how you configured the machine most likely does dhcp work at all? just to rule something out
2008-09-28T05:40:00.000Z	ibkanat		yes if directly connected to the cable modem
2008-09-28T05:41:00.000Z	ibkanat		its a fresh install of hard heron
2008-09-28T05:41:00.000Z	kitche	ibkanat	well directly connected to the cable modem using dhcp won't rule anything out with the router now will it
2008-09-28T05:42:00.000Z	ibkanat	kitche	thanks got to go
