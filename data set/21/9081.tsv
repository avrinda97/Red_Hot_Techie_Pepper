2006-06-06T05:55:00.000Z	mwe	Weirdbro	why would you want that?
2006-06-06T05:56:00.000Z	Weirdbro	mwe	I'm trying to set up a testing server on Ubuntu Desktop
2006-06-06T05:57:00.000Z	mwe	Weirdbro	yes. what's wrong with the group
2006-06-06T05:58:00.000Z	Weirdbro	mwe	but if I set the apache.conf to my user/group, phpmyadmin refuses to work
2006-06-06T05:58:00.000Z	mwe	Weirdbro	so add yourself to the appropiate groups
2006-06-06T05:58:00.000Z	mwe	Weirdbro	don't do that
2006-06-06T05:58:00.000Z	Weirdbro	mwe	I mean, the user and group options in apache.conf
2006-06-06T05:58:00.000Z	mwe	Weirdbro	that's crappy administration
2006-06-06T05:58:00.000Z	Weirdbro	mwe	How do I add myself to a group?
2006-06-06T05:59:00.000Z	Weirdbro	mwe	And the Wiki instructs you to do it in the LAMP guide, so I thought it was good
2006-06-06T05:59:00.000Z	mwe	Weirdbro	sudo gpasswd -a user group
2006-06-06T05:59:00.000Z	mwe	Weirdbro	huh?
2006-06-06T05:59:00.000Z	mwe	Weirdbro	what wiki. I'm gonna change that
2006-06-06T06:00:00.000Z	mwe	Weirdbro	that's braindead
2006-06-06T06:00:00.000Z	mwe	Weirdbro	link please. I'll change it
2006-06-06T06:01:00.000Z	Weirdbro	mwe	://wiki.ubuntu.com/ApacheMySQLPHP section 7
2006-06-06T06:18:00.000Z	Weirdbro	mwe	Actually, the braindead thing was helpful, don't remove it
