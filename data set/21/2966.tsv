2009-05-04T01:31:00.000Z	zero_mass		I have been serving my own private repository to conserve bandwidth but since installing jaunty apt complains about a missing Release.gpg file. What is this about?
2009-05-04T01:32:00.000Z	zero_mass		and im still struggling to get apt to update from my local ftp repository
2009-05-04T01:33:00.000Z	simplyc	zero_mass	 did you import the key file?
2009-05-04T01:35:00.000Z	zero_mass	simplyc	i followed a tutorial on creating a gpg key, importing the key in apt and then signing the Release file. But no joy.
2009-05-04T01:36:00.000Z	zero_mass	simplyc	the tutorial made it seem as if there was nothing overly involved about getting a secure apt setup
2009-05-04T01:36:00.000Z	zero_mass	simplyc	is there not a way to disable apt from checking for gpg signed release file?
2009-05-04T01:43:00.000Z	simplyc	zero_mass	 what tutorial?
2009-05-04T01:43:00.000Z	zero_mass	simplyc	http://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt
2009-05-04T01:45:00.000Z	simplyc	zero_mass	 what does it say when you try to install now?
2009-05-04T01:46:00.000Z	zero_mass	simplyc	W: Failed to fetch ftp://localhost/linux/ubuntu/dists/jaunty/Release  Unable to find expected entry  main/binary-i386/Packages in Meta-index file (malformed Release file?)
2009-05-04T01:47:00.000Z	zero_mass	simplyc	i have created the top-level Release file and signed it with a gpg key which I have imported to apt and that is the message it returns
2009-05-04T01:54:00.000Z	simplyc	zero_mass	 did you try file instead of ftp?
2009-05-04T01:56:00.000Z	zero_mass	simplyc	i have not. I am trying to get ftp to work as this machine will serve to another on my network
2009-05-04T01:56:00.000Z	simplyc	zero_mass	 have you verified you can ftp to that location?
2009-05-04T01:57:00.000Z	zero_mass	simplyc	indeed, and files have correct premissions and are downloadable
2009-05-04T01:58:00.000Z	simplyc	zero_mass	 what does your source line look like?
2009-05-04T01:59:00.000Z	zero_mass	simplyc	deb ftp://localhost/linux/ubuntu jaunty main multiverse restricted universe
2009-05-04T02:03:00.000Z	zero_mass	simplyc	i have been serving a local repository since fiesty. my apt has only been insisting on a Release.gpg file since i installed jaunty yesterday. Can the apt security check not be turned off?
2009-05-04T03:02:00.000Z	zero_mass	simplyc	i have followed the guide you gave, but the error regarding the missing Release.gpg file persists.
2009-05-04T03:03:00.000Z	zero_mass	simplyc	it works like a charm with a file repo but that has its limitations for my purposes
2009-05-04T03:05:00.000Z	zero_mass	simplyc	is there a way to configure apt's behaviour for network based updates?
