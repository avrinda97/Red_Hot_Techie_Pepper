2007-05-12T08:10:00.000Z	danny3793		as Vista is just flat out a polished turd
2007-05-12T08:10:00.000Z	danny3793		lol
2007-05-12T08:11:00.000Z	danny3793		i cant even play a game, but yet i have a nVIDIA GeForce 6100 nForce 405 chipset
2007-05-12T08:11:00.000Z	danny3793		im going to have to check if that chipset is even available, i sure hope that chipset is compliant
2007-05-12T08:11:00.000Z	danny3793		lemme go check
2007-05-12T08:12:00.000Z	danny3793		i have one more question
2007-05-12T08:12:00.000Z	danny3793		to even play a game or use any app that ran on windows (not C# apps) would i NEED cadega?
2007-05-12T08:12:00.000Z	danny3793		and if so is there anyway to tell how exactly that all works?
2007-05-12T08:13:00.000Z	danny3793		because ive never actually gotten to installing Ubuntu fully onto one of my PCs before
2007-05-12T08:13:00.000Z	jrib	danny3793	there is wine or you can run windows in a virtual machine
2007-05-12T08:14:00.000Z	jrib	danny3793	do you know about mono?
2007-05-12T08:15:00.000Z	jrib	danny3793	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_%28software%29
2007-05-12T08:17:00.000Z	jrib	danny3793	"allow"
2007-05-12T08:20:00.000Z	jrib	danny3793	mono is packaged, use your favorite package manager (the runtime is installed by default btw)
2007-05-12T08:21:00.000Z	danny3793	jrib	what do you mean use my fave. package manager? and do you mean the runtime is included with Ubuntu?
2007-05-12T08:41:00.000Z	jrib	danny3793	it's working fine here
2007-05-12T08:54:00.000Z	danny3793	jrib	how exactly is feisty used?
2007-05-12T08:54:00.000Z	jrib	danny3793	what do you mean?  feisty is just a version of ubuntu
2007-05-12T08:55:00.000Z	danny3793	jrib	oh so basically, it just runs itself? and i dont need to do anything other than install Ubuntu and it works alongside?
2007-05-12T08:56:00.000Z	jrib	danny3793	"it" is what in that sentence?
