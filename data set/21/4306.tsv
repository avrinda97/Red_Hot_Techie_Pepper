2008-05-18T07:01:00.000Z	ev0luti0nXtinct		can someone tell me why.... my Ubuntu guest OS won't install on VMWare Server... its having issues finding hardware for the CD-ROM drive as it progresses through the install... It starts the install but when you set the keyboard layout after that it goes to Detect hardwrae for CD-ROM and it just stalls.

2008-05-18T07:05:00.000Z	ev0luti0nXtinct		i don't even know what pastebin is even for....
2008-05-18T07:06:00.000Z	Shadow420	ev0luti0nXtinct	pastebin is a site to allow to post multi-line text without flooding the room
2008-05-18T07:06:00.000Z	ev0luti0nXtinct		ohhhhhhh
2008-05-18T07:07:00.000Z	Shadow420	ev0luti0nXtinct	it's very handy when you are needing help with ubuntu interworkings
2008-05-18T07:08:00.000Z	ev0luti0nXtinct		well i wish i could show you the text of whats going on lol but this is during the ubuntu install... I've set VMWare to automatically detect CD-ROM drive. and i'm using SCSI drive 0:0 for the install... Which worked for Win2k3 but not for any linux distro
2008-05-18T07:08:00.000Z	ev0luti0nXtinct	Shadow420	makes sense :) now i know! haha
2008-05-18T07:09:00.000Z	Shadow420	ev0luti0nXtinct	well I would suggest u use your real hardware and make a partition( laptop) or get another Hard Drive (desktop)
2008-05-18T07:10:00.000Z	ev0luti0nXtinct	Shadow420	shouldn't have to do this.... The whole point of a beefy server is to serve VPC's
