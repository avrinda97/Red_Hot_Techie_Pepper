2005-06-02T06:40:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		oh dude..i've been talking to a bot..lame
2005-06-02T06:41:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		i just compiled it.
2005-06-02T06:41:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		i was told that binaries do not "store" the location of the libs they were compiled against, but use environment variables to look for them.
2005-06-02T06:41:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		i thought bots weren't allowed in here.
2005-06-02T06:42:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		uhh..then why did he keep saying irrelevant things that sounded like something a bot would say?
2005-06-02T06:42:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		troll?
2005-06-02T06:42:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		dude, you are talking like a bot.
2005-06-02T06:43:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		i don't see an answer anywhere there.
2005-06-02T06:43:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		nothing he said was related to my question remotely.
