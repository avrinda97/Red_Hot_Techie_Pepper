2009-04-05T19:40:00.000Z	new2ubuntu		ljl: ok well im trying to get on my wireless WPA2 network, and when i click on the internet icon at the top, there are no listed networks, this makes me think that i don't have the drivers installed that i need. So i need help first finding the right linux drivers, and then installing them, and ive heard WPA2 is harder to get working, so ill need help when it comes to that.
2009-04-05T19:42:00.000Z	new2ubuntu		ljl: no wireless extensions on all three
2009-04-05T19:43:00.000Z	new2ubuntu		ljl: my question is, how does noone know how to do this, isnt it rather basic??
2009-04-05T19:44:00.000Z	new2ubuntu		ljl: don't know, i can tell you my computer model and you could prolly find out, but i dont know how to check
2009-04-05T19:45:00.000Z	new2ubuntu		ljl: really im wondering is my card unsupported, or am i just doing something wrong...
2009-04-05T19:45:00.000Z	new2ubuntu		ljl: how to check?
2009-04-05T19:45:00.000Z	doleyb	new2ubuntu	What is your card name?
2009-04-05T19:46:00.000Z	doleyb	new2ubuntu	run lspci if that'll help
2009-04-05T19:46:00.000Z	doleyb	new2ubuntu	so run lspci and look for something like it
2009-04-05T19:48:00.000Z	doleyb	new2ubuntu	Look for Atheros, i bet you have atheros
2009-04-05T19:49:00.000Z	doleyb	new2ubuntu	The reason I think he has Atheros is because ubuntu doesn't work it :(
2009-04-05T19:50:00.000Z	new2ubuntu	doleyb	my computer is a little less than a year old
2009-04-05T19:55:00.000Z	doleyb	new2ubuntu	You can read the description https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-restricted-modules-2.6.24/+bug/182489
2009-04-05T19:55:00.000Z	doleyb	new2ubuntu	(But following the directions from that bug page is Not easy!)
2009-04-05T20:06:00.000Z	doleyb	new2ubuntu	jaunty is the next version of ubuntu, coming out this month
2009-04-05T20:07:00.000Z	new2ubuntu	doleyb	o ok, well ill update it when it comes to that... i dont fell like going through the process again
2009-04-05T20:07:00.000Z	doleyb	new2ubuntu	maybe getting jaunty would fix your trouble, you can get it now... but maybe it cause you other trouble.
