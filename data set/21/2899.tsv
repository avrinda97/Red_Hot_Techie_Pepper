2009-09-09T16:24:00.000Z	amagee		ok (sorry if i'm being irritating but this is slightly different again).. any ideas why i can sftp root@mydomain.com but not sftp myuser@mydomain.com ?
2009-09-09T16:26:00.000Z	sipior	amagee	can you log in normally using ssh?
2009-09-09T16:26:00.000Z	amagee	sipior	yes
2009-09-09T16:26:00.000Z	sipior	amagee	try adding the -v switch, and seeing what sftp reports.
2009-09-09T16:28:00.000Z	amagee	sipior	http://dpaste.com/91381/
2009-09-09T16:30:00.000Z	sipior	amagee	what's your default shell upon login to that system?
2009-09-09T16:30:00.000Z	amagee	sipior	bash
2009-09-09T16:30:00.000Z	amagee	sipior	also, it was working till fairly recently.. i'm not sure what i've done except install flash media server :S
2009-09-09T16:31:00.000Z	sipior	amagee	the target machine also runs ubuntu?
2009-09-09T16:31:00.000Z	amagee	sipior	yeah
2009-09-09T16:32:00.000Z	sipior	amagee	on the remote machine, what are the permissions for /dev/null?
2009-09-09T16:33:00.000Z	amagee	sipior	crw-------
2009-09-09T16:33:00.000Z	sipior	amagee	try "sudo chmod 777 /dev/null", and try sftp again.
2009-09-09T16:33:00.000Z	sipior	amagee	or 666, really
2009-09-09T16:33:00.000Z	amagee		wow, that worked
2009-09-09T16:33:00.000Z	amagee		thanks :D
2009-09-09T16:33:00.000Z	amagee		(care to explain?)
2009-09-09T16:34:00.000Z	sipior	amagee	sftp wants to write to /dev/null. that explains why root could use sftp, but your login couldn't.
2009-09-09T16:34:00.000Z	amagee	sipior	what would have changed that?  it was working before..
2009-09-09T16:35:00.000Z	amagee		and why does it want to write to /dev/null
2009-09-09T16:35:00.000Z	sipior	amagee	(i don't know why sftp desperately needs to write to /dev/null :-)
