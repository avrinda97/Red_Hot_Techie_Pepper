2009-06-25T08:31:00.000Z	evon		thanks
2009-06-25T08:31:00.000Z	evon		Can someone please tell me the name of a good free data recovery program for linux?
2009-06-25T08:32:00.000Z	evon		I really screwed up my ubuntu partition and i need to recover data from it
2009-06-25T08:32:00.000Z	losher	evon	screwed it up how? The details matter....
2009-06-25T08:34:00.000Z	evon	losher	I started a windows installation on a separate HD but then I shut down the computer in the middle of the installation.  Then when i restarted my comp said I had an invalid partition table. so then i used testdisk and tried to restore the partition but it restored partitions from long ago. so no it's telling me I don't even have and bootable media
2009-06-25T08:35:00.000Z	evon	losher	so i just want to recover the files and do a fresh install. liveCDs are need reading any partitions or files that i need
2009-06-25T08:37:00.000Z	evon	losher	any ideas?
2009-06-25T08:38:00.000Z	losher	evon	I agree with manish. First step is to load the live cd and look around & see if your data is on any readable partition. Given that testdisk has restored the wrong partition table, unless you can find the correct one, you may be screwed....
2009-06-25T08:39:00.000Z	evon	losher	testdisk did restore the wrong one. i just don't know how to find the right one now
2009-06-25T08:40:00.000Z	losher	evon	 it will, of course, be of zero consolation to be told that you were supposed to backup any essential data before you mess with partitions
2009-06-25T08:40:00.000Z	losher	evon	try testdisk again and see if you can find the correct partition table?
2009-06-25T08:40:00.000Z	evon	losher	i barely understand the info it's giving me
2009-06-25T08:41:00.000Z	losher	evon	sorry, I've never used it. Maybe someone else knows....??
2009-06-25T08:42:00.000Z	evon	losher	so there's no program that will just scan the entire HD and find the files I need?
2009-06-25T08:42:00.000Z	losher	evon	not that I know of. Anyone?
2009-06-25T08:58:00.000Z	losher	evon	but you *did* interrupt a windows install. right?
2009-06-25T08:58:00.000Z	evon	losher	correct
2009-06-25T09:06:00.000Z	losher	evon	man dd
2009-06-25T09:06:00.000Z	evon	losher	?
2009-06-25T09:11:00.000Z	losher	evon	happy birthday from your PC....
