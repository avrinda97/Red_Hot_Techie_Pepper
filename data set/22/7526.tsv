2006-03-11T07:08:00.000Z	LjL	GDG	that package should definitely exist... would you paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to the pastebin?
2006-03-11T07:08:00.000Z	LjL		cannot even exploit properly, tsk
2006-03-11T07:09:00.000Z	GDG	LjL	I have uncomment all
2006-03-11T07:10:00.000Z	LjL	GDG	well, specifically, do you have "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu breezy main restricted" ?
2006-03-11T07:13:00.000Z	GDG	LjL	yes
2006-03-11T07:14:00.000Z	LjL	GDG	perhaps you could try a different mirror. i can assure you "libstdc++6" is a valid package
