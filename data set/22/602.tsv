2011-06-26T23:32:00.000Z	sudokill		that imo is the only minus of ssd
2011-06-26T23:33:00.000Z	sudokill		i used to use truecrypt all the time for hdds
2011-06-26T23:33:00.000Z	sudokill		for full disk
2011-06-26T23:33:00.000Z	sudokill		nah i dont encrypt now either
2011-06-26T23:33:00.000Z	sudokill		encryption is becomming sort of a trend like vms
2011-06-26T23:33:00.000Z	sudokill		lol
2011-06-26T23:34:00.000Z	DriverIssues	sudokill	 I don't know if an ssd is going to slow down to hdd speeds, I daresay that's exagerrated
2011-06-26T23:35:00.000Z	DriverIssues	sudokill	 What did they use?
2011-06-26T23:35:00.000Z	DriverIssues	sudokill	 Hm... interesting.
2011-06-26T23:39:00.000Z	sudokill	DriverIssues	2gb i think
2011-06-27T00:08:00.000Z	sudokill	DriverIssues	maybe some power saving thing
2011-06-27T00:09:00.000Z	DriverIssues	sudokill	 It was, I was just surprised it went down so low while I was doing something mildly cpu-intesnive
2011-06-27T00:09:00.000Z	sudokill	DriverIssues	sorry i wasnt following ur posts but in the bios you should be able to turn power saving off, but now youve realised its working u should leaev it
2011-06-27T00:15:00.000Z	sudokill	DriverIssues	the cpu downclocls to save power, just like gpus do
2011-06-27T00:16:00.000Z	DriverIssues	sudokill	 I know I know, I just felt the downclocking was a little too aggressive and might be messed up, turned out it wasn't, problem solved
2011-06-27T00:16:00.000Z	sudokill	DriverIssues	its supposed to be super low clock speed otherwise no point in power saving
2011-06-27T00:17:00.000Z	sudokill	DriverIssues	my gpu downclocks to 50mhz when idle
2011-06-27T00:19:00.000Z	sudokill	DriverIssues	no it shouldnt do but the sound "engine" is different on linux
2011-06-27T00:20:00.000Z	DriverIssues	sudokill	 eh... well, I shouldn't complain.  But how do I mute a sound source
2011-06-27T00:20:00.000Z	sudokill	DriverIssues	in the soun options icon thing you should be able to select devices there, right click and choose mute i think
2011-06-27T00:23:00.000Z	DriverIssues	sudokill	 it doesn't recognize the two devices as separate
2011-06-27T00:23:00.000Z	sudokill	DriverIssues	try typing alsamixer see if u can mute it there, type m to mute
