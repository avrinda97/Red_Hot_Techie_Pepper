2005-12-21T15:09:00.000Z	ispiked		what controls what goes in the notification area?
2005-12-21T15:09:00.000Z	ispiked		how do network status applets get in there?
2005-12-21T15:09:00.000Z	ispiked		it wasn't like this on Fedora.
2005-12-21T15:10:00.000Z	crimsun	ispiked	they're applets. Secondary-click the top panel, choose Add to Panel
2005-12-21T15:10:00.000Z	ispiked	crimsun	I know they're applets. What I'm asking is what determines whether or not an applet goes in the notification area.
2005-12-21T15:12:00.000Z	crimsun	ispiked	can you rephrase your question?
2005-12-21T15:13:00.000Z	ispiked	crimsun	why do some applets, such as network monitor show up in the GNOME Notification Area applet?
2005-12-21T15:16:00.000Z	crimsun	ispiked	it's not actually in the notification area
2005-12-21T15:16:00.000Z	ispiked	crimsun	ah, it's just to the right of it?
2005-12-21T15:16:00.000Z	crimsun	ispiked	correct.
2005-12-21T15:16:00.000Z	ispiked	crimsun	thanks. :)
2005-12-21T15:16:00.000Z	ispiked	crimsun	do you go to the trilug meetings, or do you just hang out in the channel?
2005-12-21T15:17:00.000Z	crimsun	ispiked	I'm a regular at the meetings (but didn't go this month)
2005-12-21T15:18:00.000Z	ispiked	crimsun	cool. might have to figure out who are you sometime. :P
2005-12-28T16:50:00.000Z	crimsun	ispiked	of course
2005-12-28T16:50:00.000Z	ispiked	crimsun	alright. trying to figure out why I can't use options led=1 on my intel wireless card.
2005-12-28T16:50:00.000Z	crimsun	ispiked	what syntax are you using in /etc/modprobe.d/foo ?
2005-12-28T16:50:00.000Z	ispiked	crimsun	if it doesn't work with `modprobe ipw2200 led=1' is it most likey their problem?
2005-12-28T16:51:00.000Z	ispiked	crimsun	`options ipw2200 led=1'.
2005-12-28T16:52:00.000Z	crimsun	ispiked	hmm, appears to work here in 6.04, can't speak for 5.10
2005-12-28T16:52:00.000Z	ispiked	crimsun	hrm... using 5.10 here.
2005-12-29T17:45:00.000Z	ispiked	crimsun	thanks.
