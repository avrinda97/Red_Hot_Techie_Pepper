2010-05-27T08:32:00.000Z	merischino		right
2010-05-27T08:32:00.000Z	merischino		this same disc, DID boot, which is how i got the install that was corrupted on it in the first place.
2010-05-27T08:33:00.000Z	merischino		AND, i performed a safe mode boot (attempted, 4 times, 4 different ways) that ultimately gave me at least the option to "check the cd" which, of course, also crapped out without a result of any kind.
2010-05-27T08:34:00.000Z	merischino		that pre-boot little menu gave me the choices to download broken packages (failed) check the cd (failed) and boot in safe mode (failed) and boot normally (failed)
2010-05-27T08:34:00.000Z	merischino		i don't have a windows cd.
2010-05-27T08:35:00.000Z	merischino		acrimmer, yes, i ran the live cd check disk. it failed.
2010-05-27T08:36:00.000Z	merischino		right, acerimmer. so, the current status is, that pc is dead until/unless i am able to get the live usb install stick configured correctly,w hich is wher ei am asking for help.
2010-05-27T08:36:00.000Z	merischino		I need to get that sucker configured, and working, so i can save my other pc.
2010-05-27T08:36:00.000Z	merischino		unless someone has other ideas.
2010-05-27T08:37:00.000Z	merischino		acerimmer. ok thats news to me. that's why i'm here. where do i get m35checksum, and how do I run it? (the iso file just completed downloading)
2010-05-27T08:37:00.000Z	wildbat	merischino	 so you have a pc taht can make the usb ?
2010-05-27T08:40:00.000Z	merischino	wildbat	i just borrowed one that is all ready to make the usb right now. usb is formatted and in place. iso files are downloaded (thought i'd do multiple live version for other than ubuntu options also if neeeded) and i just need to know the steps to follow.
2010-05-27T08:41:00.000Z	wildbat	merischino	easiest way is to install grub4dos or grub2 and d iso loop mount booting
2010-05-27T08:42:00.000Z	wildbat	merischino	persistent live session that allow you save changes in between live session
2010-05-27T08:42:00.000Z	merischino	wildbat	i tried fixing grub2 about 4 different times prior to restarting the pc and losing everything. not sure grub was the problem. and, the disaster that was happening is, no matter which os i chose to boot, it would hang and end up with a black screen. forcing me to forcefully turn it off.
2010-05-27T08:43:00.000Z	wildbat	merischino	you upgraded from grub to grub2?
2010-05-27T08:44:00.000Z	merischino	wildbat	yes, i upgraded from grub to grub2 prior to rebooting my system.
2010-05-27T08:46:00.000Z	wildbat	merischino	numbers of ppl have that issue ~ after upgrading ~ some hange forever ~ some hangs for 1-2min ~... i dunno how t fix that ~ suggesting renaming the /boot do a total reinstall of grub2 , remember to restore the kernel and initrd files . or just reinstall every from ground zer
2010-05-27T08:47:00.000Z	merischino	wildbat	not sure any of those are an option just now, not able to boot the machine at all. so reinstall from ground zero seems to be the option.
2010-05-27T08:48:00.000Z	wildbat	merischino	make a boot USB and install then ~ if you need windows ~ install windows first .
2010-05-27T08:50:00.000Z	merischino	wildbat	working on it!
2010-05-27T10:45:00.000Z	wildbat	merischino	are you connected to a router?
