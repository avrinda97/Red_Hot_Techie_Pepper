2007-04-25T16:24:00.000Z	ller3w		Can someone please help me.  I am trying to establish an internet connection with Belking Wireless G Router.  I can connect to the router, but it seems to not be routing to the internet. Any assistance would be great.
2007-04-25T16:25:00.000Z	phoeni1	ller3w	can you ping the router?
2007-04-25T16:25:00.000Z	ller3w	phoeni1	yes.
2007-04-25T16:26:00.000Z	phoeni1	ller3w	try pinging google
2007-04-25T16:26:00.000Z	ller3w	phoeni1	Doesn't work.
2007-04-25T16:26:00.000Z	ller3w	phoeni1	I used the numerics from a website I found.
2007-04-25T16:27:00.000Z	phoeni1	ller3w	does the router interface say its connected?, can you connect via ethernet?
2007-04-25T16:28:00.000Z	phoeni1	ller3w	you need to set the router via the web interface..
2007-04-25T16:28:00.000Z	ller3w	phoeni1	I'm not having any luck.
2007-04-25T16:29:00.000Z	ller3w	phoeni1	I have tried that.  Something is wrong.
2007-04-25T16:29:00.000Z	phoeni1	ller3w	did you try the wizard?
2007-04-25T16:29:00.000Z	ller3w	phoeni1	Yes.
2007-04-25T16:30:00.000Z	phoeni1	ller3w	were you connected directly from the modem to computer before you connected the router?
2007-04-25T16:30:00.000Z	ller3w	phoeni1	Yes.
2007-04-25T16:30:00.000Z	ller3w	phoeni1	I am currently connected using the wireless router under Windows xp.
2007-04-25T16:31:00.000Z	phoeni1	ller3w	do you mean to say that you can connect wirelessly to the internet from a windows machine via the router?
2007-04-25T16:32:00.000Z	ller3w	phoeni1	Yes. That is what I am doing now.
2007-04-25T16:32:00.000Z	ller3w	phoeni1	For some unknown reason, ubuntu is giving me a headache.
2007-04-25T16:33:00.000Z	phoeni1	ller3w	can you ping your windows machine?
2007-04-25T16:34:00.000Z	ller3w	phoeni1	rather.
2007-04-25T16:34:00.000Z	phoeni1	ller3w	try releasing the ip from windows by ipconfig /release then try booting into ubuntu
2007-04-25T16:35:00.000Z	ller3w	phoeni1	Okay, I will try that.
