2009-07-05T11:18:00.000Z	Hopsnick		what's the command to see the list of commands associated with a given program?
2009-07-05T11:20:00.000Z	Hopsnick		define:bow
2009-07-05T11:21:00.000Z	Hopsnick		some day we'll have define bots implanted in our minds
2009-07-05T11:21:00.000Z	Hopsnick		shift: like a restore default feature?
2009-07-05T11:22:00.000Z	Hopsnick		what's ubuntu's equivalent to a windows registry?
2009-07-05T11:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	there isn't one
2009-07-05T11:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	I think at one stage they tried to make something similar, but it's not needed
2009-07-05T11:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	they as in Linux programmers  not Ubuntu
2009-07-05T11:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	yeah and you need to be a Windows geek to understand it properly, same thing for the Blue Screen Of Death error messges :D
2009-07-05T11:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	program files  it depends on  the program where those go exactly, but program user data goes in hidden .folders in home
2009-07-05T11:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	you know about those already?
2009-07-05T11:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	ok let's say for example   the Firefox profile had gone wrong
2009-07-05T11:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	then the hidden .mozilla folder  could just be removed or moved, when Firefox is opended again,  it's like Firefox was just installed and was running for the first time
2009-07-05T11:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	or view > show hidden files and folders,   and view  > list and then press type, and   things are in a nice list in alphabetical order by type
2009-07-05T11:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	so if some program meses up instead of just  uninstalling it and re installing
2009-07-05T11:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	you can delete or move it's .folder
2009-07-05T11:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	and then you got new settings when  you re open
2009-07-05T11:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	default settings
2009-07-05T11:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	yep if you remove a  program it's .folder may still be left there,  even if you  tell it to remove the config files
2009-07-05T11:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	also it's good to learn the commands for basic things like this.  sudo apt-get install program    and then  sudo apt-get  purge  program to remove the program and config files.  or  sudo apt-get remove to remove just the program,   now  that wasn't that difficult was it? :) :D
2009-07-05T11:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Hopsnick	and  when running commands,  you need the  synaptic package manager or add/remove programs closed, or you will get an error message,  because they are just GUI's for the commands
