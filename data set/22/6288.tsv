2007-01-06T06:40:00.000Z	alink1000		wow... that... so didn't work
2007-01-06T06:40:00.000Z	alink1000		It just brought be to this black screen with a command type of line.
2007-01-06T06:40:00.000Z	alink1000		that's it.
2007-01-06T06:40:00.000Z	alink1000		I want to higher my resolution, not fix it.
2007-01-06T06:40:00.000Z	alink1000		and that thing that I was told did nothing.
2007-01-06T06:41:00.000Z	alink1000		so... anyone wanna help? I'd like to higher my resolution more than 800x600...
2007-01-06T06:41:00.000Z	alink1000		that one thing someone else told me
2007-01-06T06:41:00.000Z	alink1000		and then gave me a link
2007-01-06T06:41:00.000Z	alink1000		but I want to higher my resolution, not fix it.
2007-01-06T06:41:00.000Z	rioghal	alink1000	have you tried running this command?:  sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2007-01-06T06:42:00.000Z	rioghal	alink1000	that should allow you to add other resolutions to xorg
2007-01-06T06:44:00.000Z	rioghal	alink1000	onboard graphics? nvidia? ATI?
2007-01-06T06:45:00.000Z	rioghal	alink1000	I don't know anything about ATI, but I have onboard graphics and I chose via. Is there a driver listed something like ati?
2007-01-06T06:46:00.000Z	rioghal	alink1000	please be patient, I can only type with my left hand, the right hand got broken in a soccer game last week 
2007-01-06T06:46:00.000Z	rioghal	alink1000	I would select the ati driver and see if that works
2007-01-06T06:48:00.000Z	rioghal	alink1000	did you restart xorg?
2007-01-06T06:49:00.000Z	rioghal	alink1000	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart    but be aware that command will close x windows and all apps that depend on x
2007-01-06T06:50:00.000Z	rioghal	alink1000	when x is restarted, it should have the new resolutions available
2007-01-06T06:51:00.000Z	rioghal	alink1000	what I did was CTRL+ALT+F1, add the resolutions, restart xorg, CTRL+ALT+F7 and the new resolutions were there
2007-01-06T07:10:00.000Z	rioghal	alink1000	here are two very good starting points for docs: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/  and  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UserDocumentation
2007-01-06T07:11:00.000Z	rioghal	alink1000	 http://ubuntuforums.org/  has also saved my backside more times than I can count
2007-01-06T07:13:00.000Z	rioghal	alink1000	the safe bet is to use something like "sudo appname" for command line apps, and "gksu appname" for gui apps. example: "gksu synaptic"  will open the synaptic gui
