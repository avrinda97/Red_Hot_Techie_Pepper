2009-12-25T16:11:00.000Z	elzoog		Hey everybody I have a question
2009-12-25T16:12:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	go for it
2009-12-25T16:13:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	heh, I get that at work ... it has something to do with the avahi service
2009-12-25T16:14:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	oh, crazy ... the brightness change notifier keeps doing that?
2009-12-25T16:15:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	it's a live session?
2009-12-25T16:16:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	so much for that. was wondering if it'd be isolated to the live session ... have you tried playing with the brightness keys on the laptop at all ... maybe something is stuck?
2009-12-25T16:16:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	that's what it looks like to me
2009-12-25T16:17:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	yeah, you could sudo apt-get remove libnotify
2009-12-25T16:21:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	it'll remove the notification package ... the program that's showing any of those popups
2009-12-25T16:21:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	it's kind of a shotgun approach, but it'd get rid of the popups   :-D
2009-12-25T16:23:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	there's probably a way ... I remember hearing about a project which lets you make your own live cds off of a customized install
2009-12-25T16:24:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	maybe this will help http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=688872
2009-12-25T16:25:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	no harm in it
2009-12-25T16:26:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	it's pretty easy to do ... from your live environment, use gparted to resize the Windows partition. Then you can install Ubuntu on the freed remaining space. It'll use grub as the bootloader, so you'll be able to easily choose between Windows and Ubuntu ... but make sure to make a copy of your MBR in case you want to remove Ubuntu/Grub and go back to pure windows
2009-12-25T16:27:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	give netbook remix a try. they've come a long way, and it's quite nice now. Worst case scenario, you can change a setting in UNR and get the normal desktop
2009-12-25T16:27:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	well, you never know   :-)
2009-12-25T16:33:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	they'd want you to buy new keys whatever the occasion   :-)
2009-12-25T16:34:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	yes. it's a different point in space-time, so you should get authorization for each new quantum
2009-12-25T16:36:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	I recently installed Windows 7 on a computer then decided to not use it. Instead, I wanted it on another computer. Installed it on the new one but it refused to activate. Called them up and they reactivated, no questions asked. The process kinda sucks, but whatever
2009-12-25T16:37:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	the auto/online activation will probably fail ... but they'll probably honor it on the phone
2009-12-25T16:40:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	Windows 7 is very good, surprisingly enough
2009-12-25T16:42:00.000Z	digitalchemist	elzoog	I'll have to start going to church then!
