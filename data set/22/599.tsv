2011-06-30T08:24:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	pksadiq	what is that?
2011-06-30T08:25:00.000Z	pksadiq	THIS_IS_INSANE	can you play them on your ubuntu? can you browse the zune files using terminal?
2011-06-30T08:29:00.000Z	pksadiq	THIS_IS_INSANE	by the way, you might try, go to terminal and cd to it's path and try to copy
2011-06-30T08:29:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	pksadiq	I can't find the path, that's the problem
2011-06-30T08:29:00.000Z	pksadiq	THIS_IS_INSANE	can you browse it through file browser?(nautilus)
2011-06-30T08:30:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	pksadiq	yes.
2011-06-30T08:30:00.000Z	pksadiq	THIS_IS_INSANE	ok, then in terminal try gksudo nautilus        and browse the zune and copy the file to the computer through the same nautilus
2011-06-30T08:31:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	pksadiq	okay
2011-06-30T08:32:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	pksadiq	suddenly, my zune disappeared... it's still available through the normal file browser, but not root...
2011-06-30T08:32:00.000Z	pksadiq	THIS_IS_INSANE	is it shown in the Places> computer ?
2011-06-30T08:33:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	pksadiq	yep. but not in nautilus from root
2011-06-30T08:33:00.000Z	pksadiq	THIS_IS_INSANE	ok, in terminal try to cd to /media/  and see whether its seen there
2011-06-30T08:34:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	pksadiq	already ahead of you, it's not there, or in /dev
2011-06-30T08:36:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	pksadiq	any ideas?
2011-06-30T08:36:00.000Z	pksadiq	THIS_IS_INSANE	would you like to waste some time at pm?
2011-06-30T08:36:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	pksadiq	pm?
2011-06-30T09:19:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	pksadiq	what the fuck did that just do to my computer?
2011-06-30T09:22:00.000Z	pksadiq	THIS_IS_INSANE	better, live it to M$ :(
2011-06-30T09:24:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	pksadiq	I'm not mad at you, my computer went to a text screen, and I never got back to the desktop.
2011-06-30T09:24:00.000Z	pksadiq	THIS_IS_INSANE	my bad :(
2011-06-30T09:25:00.000Z	THIS_IS_INSANE	pksadiq	it's no big deal, I just had to reboot 3 times (two were cause of my shitty bios)
