2005-10-25T07:12:00.000Z	caonex		i have installed the latest gnome 2.10, and i make use of the international characters. I noticed the system changed the old us-international, so this time i have selected us with dead keys. However, it does not seem to work like us international, what could be wrong?

2005-10-25T07:18:00.000Z	caonex	dooglus	it might be different my problem
2005-10-25T07:18:00.000Z	caonex	dooglus	i am not using a french layout along with an us
2005-10-25T07:18:00.000Z	caonex	dooglus	and it accepts the configuration as opposed to him/her
2005-10-25T07:18:00.000Z	dooglus	caonex	maybe, but that bug is bigger than it looks
2005-10-25T07:19:00.000Z	caonex	dooglus	the layout i chose us with deadkeys has more than 2 chars per key, how can you select the other two?
2005-10-25T07:19:00.000Z	caonex	dooglus	i have not found anything like that on google, that may solve my problem
2005-10-25T07:20:00.000Z	dooglus	caonex	there's a fix in http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=15372
2005-10-25T07:20:00.000Z	caonex	dooglus	wow, awsome let me check
2005-10-25T07:27:00.000Z	caonex	dooglus	i might have overlooked it, but it seems that their problem is mainly switching from one language to another.
2005-10-25T07:28:00.000Z	dooglus	caonex	did you try using the 'alt gr' key?
2005-10-25T07:29:00.000Z	caonex	dooglus	i do not understand very well that?
2005-10-25T07:29:00.000Z	caonex	dooglus	i thought it was just to change from one language to another
2005-10-25T07:30:00.000Z	dooglus	caonex	you can use alt-gr to get the other characters on each key
2005-10-25T07:32:00.000Z	caonex	dooglus	what is gr?
2005-10-25T07:32:00.000Z	dooglus	caonex	caonex: see your space bar?  big rectangular key at the bottom?  what's to its right?
2005-10-25T07:33:00.000Z	caonex	dooglus	an alt key.
2005-10-25T07:33:00.000Z	dooglus	caonex	use it to get the other characters
2005-10-25T07:34:00.000Z	caonex	dooglus	oh that means right alt
2005-10-25T07:34:00.000Z	caonex	dooglus	i tried that already
2005-10-25T07:34:00.000Z	caonex	dooglus	i kept thinking it was alt + something else
