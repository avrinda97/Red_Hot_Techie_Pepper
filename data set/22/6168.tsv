2006-12-09T06:29:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle1		Well, I mean, I want one drive for movies, one for music, one for documents, etc...I just want the separate drives, rather than being all on the same machine, to be on diff. machines. If the term 'decentralized fileserving network' makes any sense. xD
2006-12-09T06:30:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle1		^^
2006-12-09T06:31:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle1		I don't need help -yet-, I just need to know if its possible before I get this new machine. xD
2006-12-09T06:31:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle1		Set this one up yesterday...it works so far >.> Lol
2006-12-09T06:33:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle1		Question aboutt eh /etc/exports file though.
2006-12-09T06:34:00.000Z	lovloss	Music_Shuffle1	you have to edit the fstab file to include the devices and the folders they go in.
2006-12-09T06:35:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle1		Right, I got that, except...when I reboot my router/modem, the IP's of the machines change, so in my /etc/exports, I need to include something for that, or it dies.
2006-12-09T06:35:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle1		So if I use a * before the (rw as opposed to a specific IP, it'll be ok, yes?
2006-12-09T06:36:00.000Z	lovloss	Music_Shuffle1	woo thats complicated.
2006-12-09T06:37:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle1	lovloss	heh...so I can't just use the * to allow it from all IP's? Or should I specify as like 192.168.1.*?
2006-12-09T06:37:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle1		How do I set fixed ones?
2006-12-09T06:37:00.000Z	lovloss	Music_Shuffle1	I think i would allow all IPs personally
2006-12-09T06:38:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle1	lovloss	I think that's what I'll do...just because...I dunno how to set it up otherwise. :p
2006-12-09T06:38:00.000Z	lovloss	Music_Shuffle1	Yeah, plus your in Linux so... security issues arent that big a deal
2006-12-09T06:39:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle1		Well, I'm making it rw...what are the odds of someone else accessing the drive and erasing it all? >.> Good?
2006-12-09T06:39:00.000Z	lovloss		heh. very very bad, Music_Shuffle1
2006-12-09T06:39:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle1		Seen online? You're not serious, are you? >.>
2006-12-09T06:40:00.000Z	lovloss	Music_Shuffle1	Well as you are linux and using dial up, and not windows on broadband, you are at the very bottom of a hacker's black list
2006-12-09T06:41:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle1	lovloss	Linux and broadband.* =/
2006-12-09T06:41:00.000Z	lovloss	Music_Shuffle1	 Oh! Well , how good's your router
2006-12-09T06:41:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle1		Quite? Haven't had all my files ransacked yet. xD
2006-12-09T06:42:00.000Z	lovloss	Music_Shuffle1	Personally i hate messing with IPs and ports. The website of your router often has good info on it.
