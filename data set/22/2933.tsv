2009-02-20T10:27:00.000Z	TiZ		Hi. I have a strange bug in Firefox and Swiftfox, with the SVN Murrine engine. With the latest version installed, I have a white border around my address bar and search bar. It goes away if I mouse over it, but it comes back if I do, well, most anything. Can anyone help me fix this? I can upload a screenshot of the problem if necessary.
2009-02-20T10:28:00.000Z	bruenig	TiZ	firefox is not exactly the most true to form gtk implementation
2009-02-20T10:28:00.000Z	bruenig	TiZ	or I should say, it doesn't implement gtk in a very sane way
2009-02-20T10:28:00.000Z	bruenig	TiZ	so you need to get another theme or hack the one you have
2009-02-20T10:28:00.000Z	TiZ	bruenig	I know. But it's really weird. I seem to be like, the only person with this bug. There's like one other person, and he didn't get it solved.
2009-02-20T10:29:00.000Z	bruenig	TiZ	get another theme or hack
2009-02-20T10:29:00.000Z	TiZ	bruenig	It happens with all murrine themes while the SVN version of Murrine is installed.
2009-02-20T10:29:00.000Z	bruenig	TiZ	you know what's up
2009-02-20T10:30:00.000Z	bruenig	TiZ	there is no magic command to get you ought of this, hack or move along to something else
2009-02-20T10:31:00.000Z	TiZ	bruenig	Uh... huh? I'm not looking for a magic command. I'm looking for assistance, any knowledge whatsoever that might help me solve this, rather than ignoring it or rolling back to Intrepid's Murrine (I can't do that now, my theme uses a bunch of SVN stuff now).
2009-02-20T10:33:00.000Z	bruenig	TiZ	hack the source
2009-02-20T10:33:00.000Z	TiZ	bruenig	You're kidding, right? :|
2009-02-20T10:37:00.000Z	bruenig	TiZ	your problem is clear, I mean even if one doesn't know what source changes need to be done, one can identify that your problem is a source problem
2009-02-20T10:38:00.000Z	bruenig	TiZ	there is no way around that. If the source is bad either on ff end or your engine's end, you can't do anything but fix that
2009-02-20T10:40:00.000Z	TiZ	bruenig	What you're saying mostly makes sense. I don't mean to be adversarial, but Firefox is the most popular browser for Linux, and there are loads of murrine-svn themes on gnome-look. If it was a source problem, wouldn't it be more widespread? I'm not trying to be argumentative, it just doesn't make sense.
2009-02-20T10:41:00.000Z	bruenig	TiZ	firefox is well known as having a hacked together gtk setup, it is not like other apps
2009-02-20T10:41:00.000Z	TiZ	bruenig	I'm well aware of that.
2009-02-20T10:42:00.000Z	bruenig	TiZ	I have themes that work everywhere else except firefox's input boxes where for some reason the background is black and the letters are black. Everywhere else any other input in any other app is grey on black, but not firefox in what is seemingly an identical sort of thing
2009-02-20T10:42:00.000Z	bruenig	TiZ	so it is more widespread, but what people do is they move along to other themes. You don't see bug reports on themes usually because the are millions of them
2009-02-20T10:43:00.000Z	TiZ	bruenig	I don't imagine that people would file bug reports on themes. But if it was so simple as a source problem, everyone who wanted to make or use Murrine SVN themes would be bothering the hell out of Cimi, and he'd either fix it, or svn murrine wouldn't be used. That's the way I imagine it, anyways.
2009-02-20T10:44:00.000Z	bruenig	TiZ	it is a firefox source problem
2009-02-20T10:45:00.000Z	TiZ	bruenig	I understand your point fully well. I think you understand mine, too. At this point, we're just back-and-forthing with no real constructiveness. :P
