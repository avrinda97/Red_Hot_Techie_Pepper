2005-03-27T08:42:00.000Z	robodex		yeah
2005-03-27T08:42:00.000Z	robodex		I can use that for individual programs, though?
2005-03-27T08:43:00.000Z	robodex		cool. if I switch back to ubuntu today I'll most likely ask you again for the url :p
2005-03-27T08:43:00.000Z	robodex		is it possible to install warty and then do a dist-upgrade to installing the hoary pr?
2005-03-27T08:44:00.000Z	robodex		awesome
2005-03-27T08:44:00.000Z	robodex		one more question... does doing a dist-upgrade upgrade just the software you have installed, or does it install new software as well? I wanna do a REALLY minimal install (only a 4gb hd)
2005-03-27T08:46:00.000Z	robodex		hmm. then I'll most likey just do a full install, do a dist-upgrade, and then remove all the software I don't need
2005-03-27T08:46:00.000Z	robodex		yeah, I know... xorg is actually the reason I want hoary
2005-03-27T08:47:00.000Z	robodex		hmmm that's cool
2005-03-27T08:49:00.000Z	robodex		ah, I have another question, one that I shoulda asked when I was still using ubuntu... How much of GNOME can I remove in ubuntu while still keeping the system stable? I used xfce exclusively, but I didn't know what I should/shouldn't remove from GNOME. I still wanted to use GNOME-based apps
2005-03-27T08:50:00.000Z	kotatsu	robodex	you can remove all of gnome if you want
2005-03-27T08:50:00.000Z	kotatsu	robodex	the ubuntu default install is just geared towards making GNOME usable out of the box, but there's no reason to keep if you don't need it... although I would recommend just doing a minimal install and adding xfce if you don't want anything associated with GNOME
2005-03-27T08:51:00.000Z	kotatsu	robodex	you could always just load xfce and use that, no reason to remove GNOME
2005-03-27T08:54:00.000Z	kotatsu	robodex	the drive will fail eventually and you'll lose everything anyway ;)
2005-03-29T08:57:00.000Z	kotatsu	robodex	I have 129 updates and 5 new packages I'm installing atm =) it's been like this throughout hoary
2005-03-29T08:58:00.000Z	kotatsu	robodex	better in what way? it's a personal preference
2005-03-29T08:58:00.000Z	kotatsu	robodex	I prefer evo, I know people who prefer thunderbird
2005-03-29T08:59:00.000Z	kotatsu	robodex	I even ran balsa for a while... between thunderbird and balsa I'd use balsa, but I like evo more than either
2005-03-29T08:59:00.000Z	kotatsu	robodex	evo is a PIM, thunderbird is just a mail reader
2005-03-29T08:59:00.000Z	kotatsu	robodex	you have to train the filter - make sure you mark stuff as "not spam"
2005-03-29T09:00:00.000Z	kotatsu	robodex	I don't get much spam but I know one person who uses both evo and thunderbird and *much* prefers thunderbird's spam filter
2005-03-29T09:01:00.000Z	robodex	kotatsu	I get well over 400 spams a day, so even with marking stuff as not spam I still get alot of stuff I shouldn't be getting
