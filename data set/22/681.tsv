2011-05-12T18:31:00.000Z	usr13	hseritt	ls /var/lib/dpkg/info/iptables*
2011-05-12T18:32:00.000Z	usr13	hseritt	You will [more-than-likely] see that it is installed.
2011-05-12T18:32:00.000Z	usr13	hseritt	Do they have openssh-server installed?
2011-05-12T18:33:00.000Z	hseritt	usr13	that file/dir does not exist
2011-05-12T18:33:00.000Z	hseritt	usr13	yes they do
2011-05-12T18:34:00.000Z	hseritt	usr13	again i can connect easily to them with redhat and windows
2011-05-12T18:34:00.000Z	usr13	hseritt	They may be behind a firewall router that will not allow port 22 from outside.
2011-05-12T18:34:00.000Z	usr13	hseritt	From outside?
2011-05-12T18:34:00.000Z	hseritt	usr13	im not on the outside ... im on the same subnet
2011-05-12T18:34:00.000Z	usr13	hseritt	nmap -p 22 server-ip-here
2011-05-12T18:34:00.000Z	hseritt	usr13	i can however connect via ssh to a server on the outside which is the same server
2011-05-12T18:35:00.000Z	usr13	hseritt	Should say   22/tcp open  ssh
2011-05-12T18:36:00.000Z	hseritt	usr13	Nmap scan report for 10.213.166.210
2011-05-12T18:37:00.000Z	usr13	hseritt	Ok you should be able to  connect.
2011-05-12T18:37:00.000Z	usr13	hseritt	Oh, wait. that's port 21 not 22
2011-05-12T18:37:00.000Z	hseritt	usr13	still cant
2011-05-12T18:37:00.000Z	usr13	hseritt	sshd listens on port 22
2011-05-12T18:38:00.000Z	hseritt	usr13	how come i still cant connect? it shows 22 if you look further down
2011-05-12T18:38:00.000Z	hseritt	usr13	21 is for ftp
2011-05-12T18:39:00.000Z	usr13	hseritt	Well, if it says 22 is open, that means that port 22 is open and sshd is listening behind it, so you should be able to connect.  Show us the command you are using to try and connec, (but mask the IP address).
2011-05-12T18:40:00.000Z	usr13	hseritt	And what error do you get?
2011-05-12T18:42:00.000Z	usr13	hseritt	Can you ssh into anything else on  your LAN?
