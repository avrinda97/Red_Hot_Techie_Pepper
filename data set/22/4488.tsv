2007-12-28T06:41:00.000Z	kompute1		Does anyone use a TTS application to have the computer read text??? I don't know how to open Ocra, I tried installing Ksayit and KTTSmgr, but none of them seem to work. Does anyone have experince with Text-to-Speech?
2007-12-28T06:42:00.000Z	LjL	kompute1	the only decent TTS engine there is around is Festival, i bet all those applications you've tried need it installed. what language do you need it for?
2007-12-28T06:44:00.000Z	kompute1	LjL	hey again, I need it in english, KTTS was aking me to locate Festival, but I didn't know where to point it and /usr/bin/festival dd not work
2007-12-28T06:45:00.000Z	LjL	kompute1	ok, start by doing « echo "This is a test." | festival --tts » to see if festival itself works
2007-12-28T06:46:00.000Z	kompute1	LjL	BRB, downloading it
2007-12-28T06:47:00.000Z	LjL	kompute1	you'll also need a voice besides the "festival" package itself. get festvox-kallpc16k for male american english
2007-12-28T06:50:00.000Z	kompute1	LjL	what are the other voices I can install and do i gut apt-get install them?
2007-12-28T06:51:00.000Z	LjL	kompute1	yes, of course, both festival and the voices can be obtained with apt-get or Synaptic. do an « apt-cache search festival » to list all the voices, or « apt-cache search festival english » for just the english ones
2007-12-28T07:11:00.000Z	kompute1	LjL	- I installed the voices, not I get "Linux: can't open /dev/dsp" when i echo text and pipe it through festival
2007-12-28T07:12:00.000Z	LjL	kompute1	uhm, are you on KDE?
2007-12-28T07:13:00.000Z	kompute1	LjL	no just plain ubuntu (gnome)
2007-12-28T07:13:00.000Z	LjL	kompute1	oh, i thought you were on KDE given you tried kttsd etc... i don't know, i'm on KDE myself, it's possible that /dev/dsp is blocked by the GNOME sound daemon i guess
2007-12-28T07:14:00.000Z	kompute1	LjL	i tried kttsd because it was the only choice i was given
2007-12-28T07:16:00.000Z	LjL	kompute1	what are you looking for exactly? a screen reader, or just a wait to read text files aloud...?
2007-12-28T07:18:00.000Z	kompute1	LjL	I'm looking for TTS - I have KSayIt to work, but theres a lot of echo in the voice
2007-12-28T07:19:00.000Z	LjL	kompute1	echo? that's weird... Festival's voices certainly aren't top quality (not comparable to most commercial TTS, no), but *echo* is kind of weird
2007-12-28T07:20:00.000Z	kompute1	LjL	any idea how I can use AT&T voices or other voices?
2007-12-28T07:22:00.000Z	LjL	kompute1	not really, i don't think they're supported by festival, i really think you'd have to resort to commercial third-party solutions
2007-12-28T07:22:00.000Z	kompute1	LjL	I swiched the audio from aRts to ALSA, that took away the echo
2007-12-28T07:25:00.000Z	LjL	kompute1	other TTS frontends / screen readers specifically for GNOME aside from "gnome-orca" are "lsr" and "gnopernicus", in case you want to give those a try. the audio quality will still depends on festival though
2007-12-28T07:25:00.000Z	kompute1	LjL	I do, but I have no idea how to open orca...
2007-12-28T07:26:00.000Z	LjL	kompute1	cannot help you must since i don't have GNOME... if it's not in the menu, you can always try « dpkg -L gnome-orca | grep bin » to see what the main executable program is
