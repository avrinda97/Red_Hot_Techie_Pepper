2010-09-24T00:30:00.000Z	ikonia	scriptwarlock	where did you get that package
2010-09-24T00:30:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	ikonia	somewhere from eee
2010-09-24T00:30:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	ikonia	got the hardest app to remove
2010-09-24T00:30:00.000Z	ikonia	scriptwarlock	ok, contact them as either a.) their remove script is messed up, or b.) someones deleted the python script it needs
2010-09-24T00:31:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	ikonia	any manual method? like deleteing some files?
2010-09-24T00:31:00.000Z	ikonia	scriptwarlock	you really don't want to do deleting files
2010-09-24T00:32:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	ikonia	well actuall the error is just inside the bin/dpkg
2010-09-24T00:32:00.000Z	ikonia	scriptwarlock	no, it's because a.) the remove script from the package is broke b.) someone has removed the python script it wants to call
2010-09-24T00:32:00.000Z	ikonia	scriptwarlock	it's nothing to do with dpkg
2010-09-24T00:33:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	ikonia	ah ok thanks
