2009-10-24T12:17:00.000Z	sam_		how i install games on ubuntu
2009-10-24T12:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 fire up package manager - look for games..
2009-10-24T12:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	claifyu what you are doing.
2009-10-24T12:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 if you want to run windows games you need to uise WINE and theres no guarentees that any of them wil work with wine
2009-10-24T12:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 check the wine app database for the specific ga,e
2009-10-24T12:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 that new 'quake live' works in ubuntu  (the browser based quake game just released a few weeks ago)  and see what iceroot  said.
2009-10-24T12:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 theres also several games out that use the Q3 source engine that are very nice
2009-10-24T12:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 if its slow its slow. what sort of answer are you expecting?
2009-10-24T12:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 if the servers are only giving you stuff at 10k/s then it wont matter.. but theres not any magical trick to make your dialup run as fast as a T1
2009-10-24T12:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 go to some place that has free wireless and use that I guess.
2009-10-24T12:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 no idea. I dont use mobile networking.. i rarely use wireless
2010-01-14T07:16:00.000Z	sam_	Dr_Willis	you may want to google ebox for a gui server solution for ubuntu
2010-01-14T07:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 i dont need  to use the server editions. the desktop ed works fine for me
2010-01-14T07:17:00.000Z	sam_	Dr_Willis	fine, it is not considered good practice. If you are happy to take risks that is up to you
2010-01-14T07:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 yea My home lan of 3 pc's is in danger of my dog haxxoring it. :)
2010-06-26T18:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 sudo make uninstall
2011-01-02T19:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 fdisk, or gparted. or just reformat ti some new clean filesystem
2011-04-16T13:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 depends on the video codec and player and your system specs.
2011-04-17T17:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 update the listing, upgrade, try it again.
2011-04-17T17:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 its possible that server is down.
2011-04-17T17:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sam_	 i seem to recall someone else having an issue with that esarlier today
