2006-02-20T09:49:00.000Z	Mordof	wastrel	yeah, except X showed errors and then after 5 seconds decided to work
2006-02-20T09:49:00.000Z	Mordof	wastrel	im afraid to restart my computer again
2006-02-20T09:50:00.000Z	Mordof	wastrel	it said X failed to start... maybe that was just from before

2006-02-20T10:45:00.000Z	wastrel	Mordof	 i'm thinking you need to get some video driver modules starting on boot maybe?
2006-02-20T10:45:00.000Z	Mordof	wastrel	NO! thats the problem!!!
2006-02-20T10:46:00.000Z	wastrel	Mordof	 ?
2006-02-20T10:46:00.000Z	Mordof	wastrel	installing drivers is why im having these problems

2006-02-20T12:36:00.000Z	Mordof	wastrel	what drivers are installed
2006-02-20T12:38:00.000Z	wastrel	Mordof	 hmm...  probably best to have a look at /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-02-20T12:39:00.000Z	wastrel	Mordof	 maybe  grep Driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf

2006-02-20T12:42:00.000Z	wastrel	Mordof	 you can just put the commands in a file and run the file
2006-02-20T12:43:00.000Z	Mordof	wastrel	yeah but it sometimes asks if i want to continue [y|n] , how do i hook that?
2006-02-20T12:43:00.000Z	wastrel	Mordof	 ah good point, i imagine there's a command line switch for apt that avoids that
2006-02-23T10:05:00.000Z	Mordof	wastrel	yup
2006-03-06T11:15:00.000Z	wastrel	Mordof	 there's a mail notification applet for gnome
