2008-08-25T11:52:00.000Z	hiptobecubic		I need to make a particular domain so that it is accessed using only wifi.  I believe   route add -host <hostname> dev ath0   will accomplish this. does that sound right?
2008-08-25T11:53:00.000Z	wols	hiptobecubic	put it into your /etc/network/interfaces via post-up script
2008-08-25T11:53:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	wols	what is post-up script?
2008-08-25T11:53:00.000Z	wols	hiptobecubic	a feature of /etc/network/interfaces. man interfaces
2008-08-25T11:53:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	wols	ok thanks
2008-08-25T12:08:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	wols	http://pastebin.com/f52875dfa    like this?
2008-08-25T12:11:00.000Z	wols	hiptobecubic	no. you need to write a script and call that
2008-08-25T12:13:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	wols	where are user scripts usually stored?
2008-08-25T12:14:00.000Z	wols	hiptobecubic	/etc/network/if-up.d/
2008-08-25T12:15:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	wols	and in there is just a script with the route command?
2008-08-25T12:16:00.000Z	wols	hiptobecubic	yes
2008-08-25T12:16:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	wols	it shouldn't right?
2008-08-25T12:17:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	wols	ok. and lastly, in the interfaces file then it will be     iface ath0 post-up <script>
2008-08-25T12:17:00.000Z	wols	hiptobecubic	no. read the manpage more carefully. it has examples too
2008-08-25T12:20:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	wols	do you have to include inet dhcp? i left it out because i wasn't sure.    http://pastebin.com/fcfa8d28
2008-08-25T12:21:00.000Z	wols	hiptobecubic	you forgot auto ath0
2008-08-25T12:24:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	wols	i guess i'm a bit confused about what this interfaces file REALLY does. before i added that bit at the end, all it had was loopback stuff in it. how does ath0 and eth0 function then? why don't you need auto ath0 and auto eth0 for the interfaces to work?
2008-08-25T12:24:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	wols	what brings them 'up' ?
2008-08-25T12:24:00.000Z	wols	hiptobecubic	/etc/init.d/networking
2008-08-25T12:25:00.000Z	wols	hiptobecubic	it is your network confing
2008-08-25T12:25:00.000Z	wols	hiptobecubic	ubuntu uses gnome-network-manager as well.
2008-08-25T12:29:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	wols	i think this would be easier using /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/    i'll try it there. thanks for your help :)
