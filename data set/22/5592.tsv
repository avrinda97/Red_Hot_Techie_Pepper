2007-04-14T13:54:00.000Z	kitche	gene6482	is the intel_snd8x0 module loaded?
2007-04-14T13:54:00.000Z	gene6482	kitche	how do i check?
2007-04-14T13:55:00.000Z	kitche	gene6482	lsmod|grep intel and see if it says that
2007-04-14T13:56:00.000Z	gene6482	kitche	it says other intel things, but not that
2007-04-14T13:57:00.000Z	kitche	gene6482	ok try this sudo modprobe intel_snd8x0
2007-04-14T13:57:00.000Z	gene6482	kitche	module not found
2007-04-14T13:58:00.000Z	kitche	gene6482	hmm it might be in the kernel but probably not, that might be your problem but I could have gotten the module name wrong hang on a sec
2007-04-14T13:58:00.000Z	kitche	gene6482	ah its snd_intel8x0
2007-04-14T13:59:00.000Z	gene6482	kitche	its there
2007-04-14T13:59:00.000Z	kitche	gene6482	ok is your PCM and Master volumes high?
2007-04-14T14:00:00.000Z	gene6482	kitche	yes, and nothing is muted, i followed a how to on the forums with no luck
2007-04-14T14:00:00.000Z	gene6482	kitche	it appears like it should be working but isnt
2007-04-14T14:02:00.000Z	kitche	gene6482	hmm how far is your volume turned up
2007-04-14T14:02:00.000Z	gene6482	kitche	heres the how-to i followed http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=406676&highlight=sound+update
2007-04-14T14:02:00.000Z	gene6482	kitche	all the way
2007-04-14T14:03:00.000Z	kitche	gene6482	odd it should be working
2007-04-14T14:03:00.000Z	gene6482	kitche	thats what i thought, but no luck, and it worked fine before i switched from vista
2007-04-14T14:04:00.000Z	kitche	gene6482	try this alsamixer and see if it's low
2007-04-14T14:06:00.000Z	kitche	gene6482	ok do you by chance have two sound cards like one onboard and one a card maybe it's using the wrong card but if that's not it then I can't really help you but crimson knows about sound more
2007-04-14T14:07:00.000Z	gene6482	kitche	i dont believe i have 2
