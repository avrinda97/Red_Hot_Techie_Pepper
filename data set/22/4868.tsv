2007-09-27T16:13:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsocleve1	What is your graphics card?
2007-09-27T16:14:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsocleve1	Hmm, my guess is that it's maybe an onboard nvidia or intel card.
2007-09-27T16:14:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsocleve1	the lspci command run from a terminal should give you a list of your cards
2007-09-27T16:16:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsocleve1	okay, lets see what google turns up on the S3 Unichrome Pro
2007-09-27T16:17:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsocleve1	I've found a post on the ubuntuforums that seems slightly promising
2007-09-27T16:22:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsocleve1	Did you follow the links in the post?  They led to a page that says how to get the card running.
2007-09-27T16:27:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsocleve1	do you know how to get to the folder in a terminal?
2007-09-27T16:28:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsocleve1	preferably although that too can be done from the terminal.
2007-09-27T16:29:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsocleve1	you're going to need to use the 'cd' command (change directory).
2007-09-27T16:30:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsocleve1	Could you prefix your responses with my name?  it highlights them in my chat client, making it easier to read.  Is there a file in there called README or doc or some such?
2007-09-27T16:32:00.000Z	mrnotsocleve1	peabody	no there isnt. only viamenu, vinstall_2D and vunistall
2007-09-27T16:33:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsocleve1	wow, that's certainly minimal, well, try typing ./viamenu
2007-09-27T16:33:00.000Z	mrnotsocleve1	peabody	and subfolders for several distributions but no readmes
2007-09-27T16:33:00.000Z	mrnotsocleve1	peabody	he's starting the installation but all he does is telling me he's denied  permissions
2007-09-27T16:34:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsocleve1	try sudo ./viamenu
2007-09-27T16:35:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsocleve1	when asked for a password, type yours, it won't echo, that's okay.
2007-09-27T16:35:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsocleve1	Did it tell you anything?
2007-09-27T16:36:00.000Z	mrnotsocleve1	peabody	yea, asked me to type 1 to install, then told me it was done and how to uninstall
2007-09-27T16:36:00.000Z	mrnotsocleve1	peabody	but i guess its not over yet cause i stil got the same gfx obviously
2007-09-27T16:36:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsocleve1	You have to reboot when installing graphics adapters (or at the very least kill X with ctrl+alt+backspace)
2007-09-27T16:37:00.000Z	mrnotsocleve1	peabody	okay, i will reboot then! thank you so much for your help, it really makes the difference :)
