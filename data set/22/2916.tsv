2009-06-10T15:51:00.000Z	cypha		i guess
2009-06-10T15:51:00.000Z	cypha		yeah
2009-06-10T15:52:00.000Z	cypha		but how do you do that?
2009-06-10T15:52:00.000Z	cypha		i downloaded a theme that looks mac-ish, but it isn't letting me use it as a theme
2009-06-10T15:52:00.000Z	cypha		is it not allowed in gnome?
2009-06-10T15:52:00.000Z	cypha		i have gnome-do
2009-06-10T15:53:00.000Z	cypha		are any of the three that ziroday mentioned GNome?
2009-06-10T15:53:00.000Z	gartral	cypha	warning about AWN.. it *must* have a compositing manager to run!
2009-06-10T15:54:00.000Z	gartral	cypha	nautilus *can* be used as a compositin manager if your tight on resources... but I can only get awn to run with it...
2009-06-10T15:55:00.000Z	gartral	cypha	docky
2009-06-10T15:55:00.000Z	gartral	cypha	look for screenshots on wikipedia of all the docks
2009-06-10T15:56:00.000Z	gartral	cypha	that's why we have autoremove
2009-06-10T15:57:00.000Z	gartral	cypha	sudo apt-get autoremove
2009-06-10T15:58:00.000Z	gartral	cypha	either way, the both edit the same databases, and both can (un)install anything you installed wit any other Apt-method (including GUIs)
2009-06-10T16:09:00.000Z	gartral	cypha	it did.. but it left the old kernal as a backup incase your system goes wonkey
2009-06-10T16:10:00.000Z	gartral	cypha	why? it's only taking up about 5mb
2009-06-10T16:24:00.000Z	gartral	cypha	apt-cache search <package name> from terminal, or use gksu synaptic for a GUI
2009-06-10T16:26:00.000Z	gartral	cypha	sudo apt-get remove --force ggl-qt does nothing?
2009-06-11T07:11:00.000Z	gartral	cypha	try Gizmo!
2009-06-11T07:12:00.000Z	gartral	cypha	a more open VOiP client, compatable with Skype nets
2009-06-11T07:13:00.000Z	gartral	cypha	correct, and Gizmo has it's own side network
