2009-01-04T16:37:00.000Z	sarmisak	harlemdavvey	you have a default firewall on your router, just login to your router and check your user manual
2009-01-04T16:37:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	sarmisak	how can i login to my router?
2009-01-04T16:37:00.000Z	sarmisak	harlemdavvey	and do not post your questions repeatedly
2009-01-04T16:37:00.000Z	sarmisak	harlemdavvey	use your user manual, it's different for different routers / adsl modems
2009-01-04T16:38:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	sarmisak	i have an alice w-gate telsey router
2009-01-04T16:38:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		maybe is there something on the net about it?
2009-01-04T16:39:00.000Z	sarmisak	harlemdavvey	google it then :)
2009-01-04T16:40:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	sarmisak	ok, i'll google it but i don't know what to look for..? what should i type in my search? i've tried to look for it till now but i found nothing useful looking for "router firewall ubuntu install"
2009-01-04T16:40:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	sarmisak	can you tell me something more precisely?
2009-01-04T16:40:00.000Z	sarmisak	harlemdavvey	you are asking a hardware specific question, I cannot help you about it, try your user manual or ask assistance from the manufacturer
2009-01-04T16:41:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	sarmisak	ok then, thx you so much :)
2009-01-04T16:45:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	sarmisak	do you know something about how to update repositories in my system??
2009-01-04T16:45:00.000Z	sarmisak	harlemdavvey	try this in a terminal window; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade;
2009-01-04T16:46:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	sarmisak	is that everything i have to do? i tried both commands.. so i think i have an up2date computer right now, do i?

2009-01-04T16:47:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	sarmisak	ok and should i install an antivirus application for my ubuntu?
2009-01-04T16:50:00.000Z	sarmisak	harlemdavvey	no need for that, you should be virus free for another decade or so
