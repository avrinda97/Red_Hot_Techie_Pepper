2009-01-08T22:28:00.000Z	Wingard		Omnydevi: NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (version 177)
2009-01-08T22:29:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	i would give that a whirl mate. For some reason or another 177 gives me utter hell
2009-01-08T22:26:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	 you are not using the driver then
2009-01-08T22:27:00.000Z	Wingard	omnydevi	Xorg.conf has Driver "nvidia", but it seems to be being ignored.
2009-01-08T22:27:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	that explains much of the issue. Click System - Administration - Hardware Drivers
2009-01-08T22:27:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	do you see nvidia as being activated? If so, which version?
2009-01-08T22:28:00.000Z	Wingard	omnydevi	One moment.
2009-01-08T22:28:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	I can't get 177 to work on mine either...is 173 recommended?
2009-01-08T22:29:00.000Z	Wingard	omnydevi	It isn't, but I could try it.
2009-01-08T22:29:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	i would deactivate 177, reboot, and activate 173 and reboot again
2009-01-08T22:30:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	we'll be here!
2009-01-08T22:30:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	not sure if that will do it or not, i just switched so i still have rebooting habits :(
2009-01-08T22:31:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	damn winblows nasty habits!!!
2009-01-08T22:31:00.000Z	Wingard	omnydevi	I switched last night. I used hacked Windows XP, so I didn't restart often. <_<
2009-01-08T22:44:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	try a full reboot :D
2009-01-08T22:44:00.000Z	Wingard	omnydevi	I did try that
2009-01-08T22:44:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	you have envyng?
2009-01-08T22:45:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	yeah, open synaptic and search envyng, install and try that
2009-01-08T22:46:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	you could edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and use VESA instead of nVidia or NV, that should get you a better resolution
2009-01-08T22:46:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	keen
2009-01-08T22:49:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	yeah, once you have it installed, do envyng -t from terminal. Uninstall the current driver and full reboot. When it comes back up, envyng -t and install the 173 driver. Reboot and when it comes up you should be good to go
2009-01-08T22:51:00.000Z	omnydevi	Wingard	yes
