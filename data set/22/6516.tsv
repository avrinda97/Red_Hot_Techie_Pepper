2007-04-06T10:20:00.000Z	berent		guys /girls help me
2007-04-06T10:21:00.000Z	berent		i was moving a directory from one volume to another like mv /hda1/dir /hda2/dir and power went off in between.How will i recover it
2007-04-06T10:22:00.000Z	Daverocks	berent	try fsck
2007-04-06T10:22:00.000Z	berent	Daverocks	: what will it do?
2007-04-06T10:23:00.000Z	Daverocks	berent	check filesystem and try to fix errors. look at "man fsck" for options
2007-04-06T10:24:00.000Z	berent	Daverocks	: fs is ok as i booted it but now if i try to move it then the dir will be overwritten without the part which was transferred before power cut
2007-04-06T10:25:00.000Z	berent	Daverocks	: fs is ok as i booted it but now if i try to move it then the dir will be overwritten without the part which was transferred before power cut
2007-04-06T10:26:00.000Z	Daverocks	berent	um, the filesystem can be ok and accessible, but still have errors
2007-04-06T10:27:00.000Z	berent	Daverocks	: ok but now the dir at original place is gone
2007-04-06T10:27:00.000Z	berent	Daverocks	: is there any chance
2007-04-06T10:27:00.000Z	Daverocks	berent	hm, and not all of it is transferred to where you wanted?
2007-04-06T10:27:00.000Z	berent	Daverocks	: yes
2007-04-06T10:38:00.000Z	berent	Daverocks	: what does e2fsck -b =>alternative superblock mean
2007-04-06T10:39:00.000Z	Daverocks	berent	i don't know much about the innards of filesystems, but i know that e2fsck is generally run on UNmounted filesystems
2007-04-06T10:40:00.000Z	Daverocks	berent	yeah, what brought you to e2fsck? it's different to fsck
2007-04-06T10:43:00.000Z	Daverocks	berent	not sure, i don't use fsck manually, you can just specify _one_ mount point or device for fsck to check instead of -A
2007-04-06T11:01:00.000Z	Daverocks	berent	install applications that are expecting a typical linux filesystem structure?
2007-04-06T11:01:00.000Z	Daverocks	berent	i mean, _are_ you installing those types of apps?
2007-04-06T11:01:00.000Z	berent	Daverocks	: like crystalreports
2007-04-06T11:01:00.000Z	berent	Daverocks	: may be wine related also, then?
2007-04-06T11:02:00.000Z	Daverocks	berent	not sure
2007-04-20T08:46:00.000Z	Daverocks	berent	that's the default behaviour in ubuntu because "ls" is aliased to ls with colour options
