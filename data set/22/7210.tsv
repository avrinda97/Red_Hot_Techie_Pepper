2006-08-15T11:40:00.000Z	karl		on my xubuntu laptop, when I plug in my network card and look in dmesg, it tells me that acpi turned off my pcimcia card slot. This only happens with a broadcom card; an orinoco works fine. Any idea what is up?
2006-08-15T11:41:00.000Z	karl		no
2006-08-15T11:41:00.000Z	karl		rt2500
2006-08-15T11:41:00.000Z	karl		orasis, yes
2006-08-15T11:42:00.000Z	karl		orasis, this has happened to me twice
2006-08-15T11:43:00.000Z	karl		that worked once
2006-08-15T11:43:00.000Z	karl		the next time it happened that file was gone
2006-08-15T11:43:00.000Z	karl		so I reinstalled :(
2006-08-15T11:43:00.000Z	Tonren	karl	lame...
2006-08-15T11:44:00.000Z	karl	Tonren	if you do a shift-delete it will delete the file instead of trashing it
2006-08-15T11:44:00.000Z	Tonren	karl	I think taht could work... also there's an option to include a "Delete (bypass trash)" context menu item
2006-08-15T11:44:00.000Z	Tonren	karl	It should be smart enough to figure it out by itself though.  That is extremely unexpected behavior
2006-08-15T11:47:00.000Z	Tonren	karl	fluxbox was too hardcore for me.  I stuck with GNOME.
2006-08-15T11:48:00.000Z	Tonren	karl	I tried out Xfce, but it had some serious usability flaws that eventually drove me back to GNOME
2006-08-15T11:48:00.000Z	karl	Tonren	agreed
2006-08-15T11:48:00.000Z	Tonren	karl	KDE was great for a while, but it clobbered my GNOME, and it was very, VERY bloated
2006-08-15T11:49:00.000Z	karl	Tonren	chances are you are still using dapper
2006-08-15T11:50:00.000Z	Tonren	karl	There are reasons to stay with Breezy?
2006-08-15T11:51:00.000Z	karl	Tonren	roger that
2006-08-15T11:53:00.000Z	Tonren	karl	Is there a way to actually just permanently disable Network Manager?
2006-08-15T11:53:00.000Z	karl	Tonren	iunno
2006-08-15T11:53:00.000Z	Tonren	karl	because it hinders WAY more than it helps.  It's gotta be the buggiest freaking GUI ever
