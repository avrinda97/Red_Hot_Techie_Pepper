2010-09-01T11:57:00.000Z	joljam	Jordan_U	After the installation, I am booting with the live CD. What should I do? Should I type mount in the terminal?
2010-09-01T11:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joljam	Yes.

2010-09-01T12:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joljam	Can you follow this guide: http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide and tell me what the exact error from grub-install is?
2010-09-01T12:08:00.000Z	joljam	Jordan_U	when I type in sudo fdisk -l in the terminal i get the message saying "Unable to seek on /dev/sda
2010-09-01T12:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joljam	Something is definitely odd then. Is your hardware special in any way that you can think of?
2010-09-01T12:10:00.000Z	joljam	Jordan_U	its a HP Pavilion 64 bit onto which i am installing a 32 bit ubuntu
2010-09-01T12:12:00.000Z	joljam	Jordan_U	.. last time I installed ubuntu 10.04 it was an upgrade from 9.10 not a full blown install
2010-09-01T12:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joljam	What is the output of "sudo blkid"?

2010-09-01T12:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joljam	Ok, so you have some type of RAID (or at least blkid thinks you do). Do you know anything about it?
2010-09-01T12:18:00.000Z	joljam	Jordan_U	I do not know about it
2010-09-01T12:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joljam	Can you pastebin the output of "ls -l /dev/mapper/"?
2010-09-01T12:21:00.000Z	joljam	Jordan_U	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/GWdxBQrWÂ 
2010-09-01T12:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joljam	You should be able to do "sudo fdisk -l /dev/mapper/pdc_bcdhdijdfb"
2010-09-01T12:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joljam	Continue following the instructions from there.
2010-09-01T12:24:00.000Z	joljam	Jordan_U	Thanks . let me try it out
2010-09-01T12:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joljam	You're welcome. Even if it does work you may want to consider disabling RAID in the BIOS and re-installing Ubuntu with the "nodmraid" option. What you have is called Fake RAID, called that because companies try to pass it off as true hardware RAID when all it is is some code in the BIOS and software raid. It's often a pain to deal with as Fake RAID is generally proprietary and poorly documented (if at all).
2010-09-01T12:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joljam	The only real advantage is that you can boot windows from it. While linux can boot from pure software RAID, windows can't.
2010-09-01T12:32:00.000Z	joljam	Jordan_U	In fact I do not want to have the ability to boot Windows
2010-09-01T12:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	joljam	I need to leave so I can't walk you through disabling Fake RAID in your BIOS and booting the install CD with the "nodmraid" option but I will be here tomorrow and maybe someone else can help you also.
