2011-06-19T03:07:00.000Z	danny		Hey, I think my help thread on ubuntu forums may have died (the guys hasn't responded in a number of hours). Can someone take a look please? the url is ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=10954391#post10954391
2011-06-19T03:09:00.000Z	danny		Does anyone have time to check out my thread or should I try a different channel?
2011-06-19T03:10:00.000Z	pfifo	danny	this is in a virtual machine?
2011-06-19T03:10:00.000Z	pfifo	danny	you cant use that usb device in a virtual machine iirc, only usb storage will work
2011-06-19T03:11:00.000Z	danny	pfifo	Oh, so I need to dualboot?
2011-06-19T03:11:00.000Z	pfifo	danny	what you need todo is bridge the wireless connection from windows into your VM
2011-06-19T03:11:00.000Z	danny	pfifo	I have wireless in my VM, but I need to access the actual device for kismet
2011-06-19T03:12:00.000Z	pfifo	danny	you need to dualboot, or check out the aircrack livecd for a ready to go patched ndiswrapped drivers for kismet
2011-06-19T03:13:00.000Z	danny	pfifo	Ready to go? As in I install the things from the cd and my usb device will plug n play?
2011-06-19T03:13:00.000Z	pfifo	danny	ready to go as you put the cd in your computer and boot, no install or anything
2011-06-19T03:14:00.000Z	pfifo	danny	backtrack and aircrack livecd are both like that
2011-06-19T03:14:00.000Z	danny	pfifo	oh I see
2011-06-19T03:14:00.000Z	danny	pfifo	I tried to use backtrack too but it didn't recognize my usb thing
2011-06-19T03:14:00.000Z	danny	pfifo	albeit in VM
2011-06-19T03:14:00.000Z	pfifo	danny	youll never get it to work in a vm
2011-06-19T03:15:00.000Z	pfifo	danny	just boot that CD and your set!
2011-06-19T03:15:00.000Z	danny	pfifo	Ok, would the same work for backtrack?
2011-06-19T03:16:00.000Z	danny	pfifo	Like, could I boot from the backtrack live cd and have everything ready to go?
2011-06-19T03:16:00.000Z	pfifo	danny	yeah, but im not 100% sure of how well maintained backtracks drivers are for kismet, it can do alot more, where as aircrack is specifically for kismet/airocrack
2011-06-19T03:17:00.000Z	danny	pfifo	Alright thanks! So I should be downloading the "Slitaz Aircrack-ng Distribution" to boot from, right?
2011-06-19T03:18:00.000Z	pfifo	danny	sounds good
2011-06-19T03:18:00.000Z	danny	pfifo	perfect, thanks!
