2010-02-19T13:34:00.000Z	justin22885		has anyone here ever installed ubuntu from the 12mb network install image?
2010-02-19T13:35:00.000Z	justin22885		im doing that now.. its download and installing the base system now
2010-02-19T13:35:00.000Z	justin22885		my laptop uses wifi, so i had to share internet with my desktop
2010-02-19T13:36:00.000Z	justin22885		im trying to decide exactly what to install after the base command line system is up and running
2010-02-19T13:37:00.000Z	justin22885		which distro did you use actionparsnip?
2010-02-19T13:37:00.000Z	justin22885		i have 1gb RAM and a 1.6ghz cpu
2010-02-19T13:37:00.000Z	justin22885		this is a netbook
2010-02-19T13:38:00.000Z	justin22885		the LXDE screenshots remind me of windows xp
2010-02-19T13:39:00.000Z	justin22885		maybe, lightness is a good idea, though this netbook will run windows 7 and vista, id like to keep it to windows xp or lesser level of latency
2010-02-19T13:40:00.000Z	paotzu	justin22885	I have same configuration, run full ubuntu no issues
2010-02-19T13:41:00.000Z	paotzu	justin22885	use afterstep
2010-02-19T13:43:00.000Z	paotzu	justin22885	use wdm like redhat 5
2010-02-19T13:45:00.000Z	paotzu	justin22885	if you want to speed your laptop, use gparted to resize your hard disk, dd to backup the file, and then install a ssd hard disk and dd the file back.
2010-02-19T13:45:00.000Z	paotzu	justin22885	can you run gnome or... you are sticking to afterstep?
2010-02-19T13:46:00.000Z	paotzu	justin22885	just remember single cell is better
2010-02-19T13:47:00.000Z	paotzu	justin22885	afterstep is very old, lightweight window manager
2010-02-19T13:53:00.000Z	paotzu	justin22885	use non-partisan-dm package
2010-02-19T13:53:00.000Z	justin22885	paotzu	what is that?
2010-02-19T13:55:00.000Z	paotzu	justin22885	In all seriousness, you can use SLiM, Orthos, Enter, etc...
2010-02-19T14:08:00.000Z	paotzu	justin22885	absolute
2010-02-19T14:09:00.000Z	paotzu	justin22885	try compiz-deskmenu
2010-02-19T14:11:00.000Z	paotzu	justin22885	it is a generic program menu for compiz fusion that you can go in and edit what you want etc
