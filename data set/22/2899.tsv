2010-01-17T20:18:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89		If I connect a USB - serial adapter. Which would be the address to get to the serial port?
2010-01-17T20:19:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89		would it be /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyUSB0?
2010-01-17T20:21:00.000Z	LjL	natrixnatrix89	if it works, i think it should be something like /dev/ttyUSB0
2010-01-17T20:22:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	LjL	What do you mean - if it works?
2010-01-17T20:22:00.000Z	LjL	natrixnatrix89	well, i mean the adapter might not be recognized... but hopefully it will
2010-01-17T20:24:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	LjL	dmesg says: http://paste.ubuntu.com/358077/
2010-01-17T20:24:00.000Z	LjL	natrixnatrix89	then it should definitely be recognized at /dev/ttyUSB0
2010-01-17T20:25:00.000Z	LjL	natrixnatrix89	yes.
2010-01-17T20:26:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	LjL	The problem Is I have connected a weather station to that port. But when I run wview and tell it to use this address, the daemons start, but it says its still starting
2010-01-17T20:27:00.000Z	LjL	natrixnatrix89	it might be waiting for some flow control signal that never gets activated. have a look at the flow control options. you should probably also try debugging using the package "minicom" (a simple terminal emulator)
2010-01-17T20:28:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	LjL	what is flow control, and what exactly do I have to try? Sorry i'm such a newbie.. I just really want to set up the weather station..
2010-01-17T20:30:00.000Z	LjL	natrixnatrix89	it might end up being a bit complicated. serial ports (the RS232 interface) have a pin or two that are used to say "yes, i'm here, i'm a serial device, and i'm ready to send/receive". those are called RTS/CTS (ready to send / clear to send).  alternatively, another method of flow control is called XON/XOFF, and doesn't use any additional pins
2010-01-17T20:30:00.000Z	LjL	natrixnatrix89	it's possible, for example, that your program expects RTS/CTS signals, but those aren't carried by the adapter.
2010-01-17T20:30:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	LjL	I just installed minicom. What can I do with it?
2010-01-17T20:30:00.000Z	LjL	natrixnatrix89	how you would tell your software to ignore them... i don't know that.
2010-01-17T20:30:00.000Z	LjL	natrixnatrix89	you can try to see the raw output that's coming from the serial port, if any.
2010-01-17T20:31:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	LjL	how do I change the port on minicom?
2010-01-17T20:33:00.000Z	LjL	natrixnatrix89	i don't really remember these details
2010-01-17T20:34:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	LjL	Ok. then how do I see what information is it sending?
2010-01-17T20:37:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	LjL	I just connected to /dev/ttyUSB0, but all I see is this http://paste.ubuntu.com/358082/
2010-01-17T20:38:00.000Z	LjL	natrixnatrix89	well, i don't think i can help you further... all i can say is try playing with minicom settings (search for RTS/CTS, for one, and try activating or deactivating it), also find out what speed the port is running at, and see if anything ever shows up.
2010-01-17T20:39:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89	LjL	really thanks for your help!
