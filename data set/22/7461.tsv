2006-03-28T17:48:00.000Z	Zibby	RipVanFish	does your DHCP server require sending a host name?
2006-03-28T17:49:00.000Z	RipVanFish	Zibby	yes, I think it might
2006-03-28T17:49:00.000Z	Zibby	RipVanFish	Sec, have to pull up a Ubuntu box to look at something. ;)
2006-03-28T17:49:00.000Z	RipVanFish	Zibby	come to think of it they need the host name and my ethernet address
2006-03-28T17:50:00.000Z	Zibby	RipVanFish	Edit /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf, add a line send host-name "hostname";
2006-03-28T17:50:00.000Z	Zibby	RipVanFish	then do ifdown eth0; ifup eth0 and cross your fingers
2006-03-28T17:51:00.000Z	RipVanFish	Zibby	alright I'll give this a try
2006-03-28T06:05:00.000Z	RipVanFish	Zibby	came back with error temporary name resolution or something
2006-03-28T06:09:00.000Z	Zibby	RipVanFish	If you configure it with a static IP does it work?
2006-03-28T06:09:00.000Z	RipVanFish	Zibby	doesn't work even then
2006-03-28T06:09:00.000Z	Zibby	RipVanFish	What kind of network card?
2006-03-28T06:10:00.000Z	RipVanFish	Zibby	- Realtek RTL8201CL 10/100 Ethernet LAN PHY
2006-03-28T06:10:00.000Z	RipVanFish	Zibby	it's integrated

2006-03-28T06:13:00.000Z	Zibby	RipVanFish	looks like the driver may not be in Ubuntu based on a quick google search :)
2006-03-28T06:14:00.000Z	RipVanFish	Zibby	according to this it should be working https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/24801
2006-03-28T06:16:00.000Z	Zibby	RipVanFish	are you installing Dapper?
2006-03-28T06:16:00.000Z	RipVanFish	Zibby	It's already installed
2006-03-28T06:49:00.000Z	Zibby	RipVanFish	try the driver provided by VIA as previously suggested.
2006-03-28T06:50:00.000Z	RipVanFish	Zibby	oh that directed me to an XP driver :S
2006-03-28T06:52:00.000Z	RipVanFish	Zibby	aha I found something
2006-03-28T06:53:00.000Z	RipVanFish	Zibby	can you send me that link again just in case?
