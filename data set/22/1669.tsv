2010-08-06T22:00:00.000Z	bjhaid		hi, i successfully had a adhoc wifi connection with a vista machine, but i could not share files, i have samba installed, can anyone pls help out on this?
2010-08-06T22:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	bjhaid	adhoc conection so you can ping him?
2010-08-06T22:02:00.000Z	bjhaid	sacarlson	i can ping, though it took a while before i had a succesful ping
2010-08-06T22:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	bjhaid	do you just want to move one file or many?
2010-08-06T22:03:00.000Z	bjhaid	sacarlson	i wan to be able to share resources, move files and sorts, just be able to access both pcs
2010-08-06T22:06:00.000Z	bjhaid	sacarlson	i wan to be able to share resources, move files and sorts, just be able to access both pcs
2010-08-06T22:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	bjhaid	can you connect with a wire first and get the samba working before you deal with the wifi problems?
2010-08-06T22:09:00.000Z	bjhaid	sacarlson	with wire, without samba i can access the vista machine, and that's adequate for me, though i would like to get samba working but what i have already would be adequate with the wifi
2010-08-06T22:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	bjhaid	I have had many problems getting security setup on samba with windows.  every time it takes me 2 hours to get to work
2010-08-06T22:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	bjhaid	if I move files it sometimes easier to setup apache2 on my ubuntu and have the windows just get it from a browser
2010-08-06T22:12:00.000Z	bjhaid	sacarlson	i am not really interested in getting samba work, with wired connection i can access windows so all i would want is to access windows from ubuntu
2010-08-06T22:13:00.000Z	bjhaid	sacarlson	apache2 how do i get that done
2010-08-06T22:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	bjhaid	oh windows from ubuntu that's not going to help you then
2010-08-06T22:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	bjhaid	I guess you will need samba then
2010-08-06T22:15:00.000Z	bjhaid	sacarlson	lemme know how u get the apache2 done, could be an interesting challenge
2010-08-06T22:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	bjhaid	iktomi  maybe that would be easier.  nfs has very little security
2010-08-06T22:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	bjhaid	iktomi: only thing I used nfs for was boot off network
2010-08-06T22:17:00.000Z	bjhaid	sacarlson	how do i get nfs working?
2010-08-06T22:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	bjhaid	google find the driver
2010-08-06T22:18:00.000Z	bjhaid	sacarlson	the driver works on both right?
2010-08-06T22:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	bjhaid	setup the nfs on windows first nfs is easy on linux
2010-08-06T22:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	bjhaid	but I don't recall using it for this before but eather way will work eather get samba to work or nfs on windows
