2006-10-31T11:34:00.000Z	cieffe		hi everybody
2006-10-31T11:34:00.000Z	cieffe		maybe i found a bug, but i don't know so i ask here
2006-10-31T11:34:00.000Z	cieffe		use nautilus to copy or move file from my usb disk is very slow
2006-10-31T11:35:00.000Z	cieffe		and use the processor
2006-10-31T11:35:00.000Z	cieffe		too much
2006-10-31T11:36:00.000Z	cieffe		if i do a cp form terminal it is fast or better is normal :)
2006-10-31T11:38:00.000Z	teledyn	cieffe	is it a FAT volume?
2006-10-31T11:38:00.000Z	teledyn	cieffe	what does mount show the device as?
2006-10-31T11:38:00.000Z	cieffe	teledyn	no XFS, but with a FAT the problem is the same
2006-10-31T11:39:00.000Z	cieffe	teledyn	/dev/sda1 on /media/MAXTOR type xfs (rw,nosuid,nodev)
2006-10-31T11:39:00.000Z	teledyn	cieffe	hmm okay its not using the slow usb driver
2006-10-31T11:40:00.000Z	cieffe	teledyn	with dapper there isn't this problem
2006-10-31T11:40:00.000Z	teledyn	cieffe	do you see any errors in syslog?
2006-10-31T11:40:00.000Z	cieffe	teledyn	i take a look now
2006-10-31T11:41:00.000Z	cieffe	teledyn	but the strange is the if I use a terminal, inside gnome, it si fast
2006-10-31T11:41:00.000Z	teledyn	cieffe	in that case...
2006-10-31T11:42:00.000Z	teledyn	cieffe	i have no idea.  maybe its related to FAD but that's just a wild guess
2006-10-31T11:43:00.000Z	cieffe	teledyn	FAD? what is it?
2006-10-31T11:43:00.000Z	cieffe	teledyn	syslog seems ok
2006-10-31T11:43:00.000Z	teledyn	cieffe	i think that's the name.  the gnome file monitoring daemon thing
2006-10-31T11:43:00.000Z	cieffe	teledyn	thanks anyway :)
2006-10-31T11:44:00.000Z	cieffe	teledyn	yes, maybe you right, do you know how to stop it ?
