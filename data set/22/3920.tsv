2008-04-29T14:22:00.000Z	cmol	whiteeagle	usplash stops at "reading files needed to boot" and then boots on in text mode
2008-04-29T14:23:00.000Z	cmol	whiteeagle	I made som changes to my swaps UUID in fstab according to a bug repport on launchpad..
2008-04-29T14:24:00.000Z	whiteeagle	cmol	can you revert to original?
2008-04-29T14:24:00.000Z	cmol	whiteeagle	original fstab?
2008-04-29T14:25:00.000Z	whiteeagle	cmol	yes
2008-04-29T14:25:00.000Z	whiteeagle	cmol	just see will the system boot in visual mode
2008-04-29T14:26:00.000Z	cmol	whiteeagle	i upgraded from gutsy to hardy, and thats when it happend, so if the old fstab i stored somewhere i'd could?
2008-04-29T14:27:00.000Z	whiteeagle	cmol	I think that gedit stores a hidden backup in the folder
2008-04-29T14:28:00.000Z	whiteeagle	cmol	I think it ended with a ~
2008-04-29T14:28:00.000Z	whiteeagle	cmol	that saved me a lot of times
2008-04-29T14:30:00.000Z	cmol	whiteeagle	I found the file, but is that from before my update from gutsy to hardy?
2008-04-29T14:30:00.000Z	whiteeagle	cmol	I don't know exactly
2008-04-29T14:32:00.000Z	cmol	whiteeagle	I have made changes to the file afterwards so i persume it would be that version of the file i'd revert?
2008-04-29T14:33:00.000Z	whiteeagle	cmol	yes
2008-04-29T14:33:00.000Z	whiteeagle	cmol	in that case yes
2008-04-29T14:34:00.000Z	cmol	whiteeagle	Damn.. And the guys at launchpad doesn't answer..
