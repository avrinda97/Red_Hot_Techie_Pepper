2009-03-17T13:30:00.000Z	BABER		what command i have to use for run ssh?
2009-03-17T13:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	BABER	ssh is the command in terminal
2009-03-17T13:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	BABER	for the client
2009-03-17T13:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	BABER	windows doesnt naturally have an ssd server
2009-03-17T13:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	BABER	then you will need to instal an ssh service on your windows box t connect to, ##windows can advise there
2009-03-17T13:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	BABER	if you want to connect TO windows FROM linux
2009-03-17T13:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	BABER	if you want to use a windows client to connect to an ubunt ssh server then putty is a fine choice
2009-03-17T13:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	BABER	when you connect, log in as you
2009-03-17T13:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	BABER	loggin in as root over ssh is a really bad idea anyways
2009-03-17T14:19:00.000Z	BABER	ActionParsnip1	how can find ports?
2009-03-17T14:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	BABER	ports of what, can you expand on your vague question
2009-03-17T14:21:00.000Z	BABER	ActionParsnip1	ports that are opened or i have used them
2009-03-17T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	BABER	netstat -a
2009-03-17T14:22:00.000Z	BABER	ActionParsnip1	for example how can understand pidgin is use from which port?
