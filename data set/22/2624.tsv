2009-04-25T14:00:00.000Z	Szaboka	maodun	yes
2009-04-25T14:00:00.000Z	Szaboka	maodun	tried to blacklist alsa
2009-04-25T14:01:00.000Z	Szaboka	maodun	but i got rid of that thanks to LordKow
2009-04-25T14:01:00.000Z	maodun	Szaboka	 in sound preferences, is everything set to use 'ALSA'?
2009-04-25T14:03:00.000Z	Szaboka	maodun	i tell you, i got that info to install oss instead... didnt really know that it's a sh't actually
2009-04-25T14:03:00.000Z	Szaboka	maodun	and now i dont have alsa in the playback properties
2009-04-25T14:03:00.000Z	Szaboka	maodun	actually at the mixers
2009-04-25T14:04:00.000Z	Szaboka	maodun	"device" sorry - there is 'playback: null otput'
2009-04-25T14:04:00.000Z	Szaboka	maodun	"device" sorry - there is 'playback: null output' **
2009-04-25T14:05:00.000Z	maodun	Szaboka	hmm, I don't really know how to help you much beyond telling you to try to be sure all the necessary alsa stuff is installed and then to configure everything to use that. sorry, and good luck!
2009-04-25T14:05:00.000Z	Szaboka	maodun	can you help me in Installing all those ALSA stuff please?
2009-04-25T14:06:00.000Z	Szaboka	maodun	so where from and how to?
2009-04-25T14:09:00.000Z	maodun	Szaboka	sorry, i'm really not an expert on linux sound issues - i just resolved one myself and thought i might be able to help if you had the same problems. but google around for 'ubuntu no sound' and you should find a couple of pages that recommend loads of packages to make sure you have installed and tell you configs to check
2009-04-25T14:09:00.000Z	Szaboka	maodun	thank you for your help :)
2009-04-25T14:09:00.000Z	maodun	Szaboka	wish i could help more. good luck!
