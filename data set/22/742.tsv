2011-05-25T03:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	sudo apt-get --reinstall install xubuntu-desktop      should do it
2011-05-25T03:28:00.000Z	MK``	ActionParsnip	actually refreshing my software sources fixed it. It removed all my PPAs though... didn't know it would do that

2011-05-28T10:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	been reading omgubuntu eh ;)
2011-05-28T10:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	hehe it's listed there, I expect we'll get a lot of folks asking
2011-05-28T11:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	why is kde aimed at windows folks and not gnome?
2011-05-28T11:13:00.000Z	MK``	ActionParsnip	Well, all of Linux is aimed at it, I mean in the overall way things are presented and organized
2011-05-28T11:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	both can be manipluated and changed...
2011-05-28T11:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	what about Enlightenment, or Awesome or flwm, or openbox, or fluxbox and all the other DEs available...
2011-05-28T11:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	you can run just openbox without DE
2011-05-28T11:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	it would give less flexibility if it was
2011-08-08T01:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	try:  sudo update-alternatives â€“config default.plymouth
2011-08-08T01:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	http://idyllictux.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/lucidubuntu-10-04-high-resolution-plymouth-virtual-terminal-for-atinvidia-cards-with-proprietaryrestricted-driver/     may help
2011-12-04T07:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	do you have the libdvdcss installed?
2011-12-04T07:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	didn't see it mixed in with the other text
2011-12-04T07:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	try gnome-mplayer :)
2011-12-04T07:13:00.000Z	MK``	ActionParsnip	when I try to open it with Gnome-mplayer without menus, it does not work. If I try it with menus, it runs extremely choppy.
2011-12-04T07:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	is the DVD player SATA?
2012-11-07T06:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	blacklist the driver module
2012-11-07T06:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MK``	if you blacklist the driver, it won't get loaded and the system will stay silent
