2005-03-11T15:42:00.000Z	racingcamel		I have just installed ubuntu and as I was downloading udates it froze for 15 mins after which i restarted my computer. It appeared fine until it claimed to be finished and left me with a command prompt instead of a Graphical Login. How do I get gnome to work correctly?
