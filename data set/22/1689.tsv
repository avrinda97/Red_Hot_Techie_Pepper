2010-05-20T01:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	no, but if you use Wubi, there will be performance issues on Ubuntu,  you may not notice them though
2010-05-20T01:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	that's one reason why it's better to use a proper partitioend install instead :)
2010-05-20T01:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	yes and most people don't want to just get rid of Ubuntu either, once they have tried it
2010-05-20T01:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	in fact many will want to get rid of Windows once trying it
2010-05-20T01:04:00.000Z	chkdsk	sebsebseb	I've been using Ubuntu for a few days and if I was forced to make the choice, windows would win outright. I'm a gamer :P
2010-05-20T01:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	this idea that Ubuntu  or other Linux distros sucks for gaming, isn't really  true
2010-05-20T01:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	since there are quite a lot of good native games, plus  it is possible to have a lot of Windows games working well in Wine
2010-05-20T01:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	also apparnatly its better to play games on a console than on a PC
2010-05-20T01:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	a lot of games will work in a WIndows virtual machine also
2010-05-20T01:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	ok  3D gaming is a bit hrm at the moment, but that's getting there,  and depending on your hardware, that may work well now
2010-05-20T01:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	most or all 2D games for Windows though, I expect will work well in a Windows virtual machine
2010-05-20T01:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	so dual boot with Windows if you want, and use that for gaming,  and  a Linux distro, for actsaul computing?
2010-05-20T01:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	there are quite a few good native Linux 3D games :)
2010-05-20T01:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	they have done a Steam for Mac, and I have read that Steam for Linux is coming soon
2010-05-20T01:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	if the support pages mention Linux, they are probably also rather out to date
2010-05-20T01:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	I have read quite a lot of recent stuff, that is saying that Steam for Linux is coming
2010-05-20T01:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	soon
2010-05-20T01:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	also you can run Steam in Wine quite well, as far as I know
2010-05-20T01:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	since quite a lot of people do that
2010-05-20T01:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	if you must use propritary games,  and won't use Wine or  a Windows virtual machine,  fine just use Windows on a pshyical install for that.
2010-05-20T01:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chkdsk	for actsaul computing though, Linux distros tend to be better :)
