2008-02-17T03:15:00.000Z	mysterycool	alexrudd	nothing happens :s
2008-02-17T03:16:00.000Z	alexrudd	mysterycool	  Nothing is supposed to happen yet.  That's just making the file executable so you can run it with the next line
2008-02-17T03:19:00.000Z	mysterycool	alexrudd	something is wrong
2008-02-17T03:20:00.000Z	mysterycool	alexrudd	i did that then the installation begun then at the desktop a new folder was created called RealPlayer and then the installation finished but i cant find the actual realplayer :s
2008-02-17T03:20:00.000Z	mysterycool	alexrudd	i checked the Applications menu and its not there :s

2008-02-17T03:21:00.000Z	mysterycool	alexrudd	huh?
2008-02-17T03:26:00.000Z	alexrudd	mysterycool	Go to the realplayer directory in a terminal
2008-02-17T03:26:00.000Z	alexrudd	mysterycool	and type ./realplay.bin
2008-02-17T03:26:00.000Z	mysterycool	alexrudd	a new folder has been created called RealPlayer and the installation was done via the terminal
2008-02-17T03:27:00.000Z	mysterycool	alexrudd	ok so i go to the realplayer folder or .bin file?
2008-02-17T03:28:00.000Z	alexrudd	mysterycool	Well, I doubt you want to launch it from the terminal all the time, so point the launcher to the bin file
2008-02-17T03:29:00.000Z	alexrudd	mysterycool	It's somewhat odd installing an executable to ~/Desktop rather than /usr/bin but it will work fine
