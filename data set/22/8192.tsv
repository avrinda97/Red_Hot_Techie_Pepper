2007-02-08T08:53:00.000Z	||cw		after upgrading from dapper to edgy, i'm getting anacron emails with "/usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d: 274: /sbin/runlevel: not found", I also get it from some package install scripts as well
2007-02-08T08:54:00.000Z	||cw		and I do not have /sbin/runlevel, is that bad?  and what package would it be in?
2007-02-08T08:54:00.000Z	soundray	||cw	upstart-compat-sysv
2007-02-08T08:55:00.000Z	||cw	soundray	k, I have none of the upstart stuff installed, shoudl I uninstall sysv-rc?
2007-02-08T08:56:00.000Z	||cw	soundray	do i also need upstart-logd?
2007-02-08T08:56:00.000Z	soundray	||cw	you did an upgrade to edgy without switching to upstart?
2007-02-08T08:56:00.000Z	||cw	soundray	guess so, i just did a dist-upgrade
2007-02-08T08:57:00.000Z	soundray	||cw	that may not have been enough. It's generally better to use update-manager
2007-02-08T08:57:00.000Z	||cw	soundray	been bitten twice by that, restarted/crashed X server in the middle of the update
2007-02-08T08:58:00.000Z	soundray	||cw	is a fresh install an option?
2007-02-08T08:59:00.000Z	||cw	soundray	heh, I haven't "fresh installed" this one since debian sarge :D
2007-02-08T08:59:00.000Z	soundray	||cw	I went from sarge to dapper, then did a fresh install with edgy. Much smoother than the upgraded installation...
2007-02-08T09:00:00.000Z	||cw	soundray	yeah, except for the update takes and hour and fresh install takes a day for me to be productive again
2007-02-08T09:02:00.000Z	soundray	||cw	yeah, except that your upgrade wrecked things apparently
2007-02-08T09:02:00.000Z	||cw	soundray	not too badly, it's still usable
2007-02-08T09:03:00.000Z	||cw	soundray	though the more likely cause was me switching from gnome to xfce and uninstalling as much of the gnome stuff as I could
2007-02-08T09:04:00.000Z	soundray	||cw	/sbin/runlevel is provided by either sysvinit or upstart-compat-sysv, hope that helps
2007-02-08T09:04:00.000Z	||cw	soundray	I'll try switching to upstart, thanks.
2007-02-08T10:04:00.000Z	soundray	||cw	please don't recommend that -- you can get a messed-up environment that way
2007-02-08T10:05:00.000Z	||cw	soundray	messed up how, i hate it when I'm told that something I've been using fine for years is "bad" with wavy arms
2007-02-08T10:06:00.000Z	soundray	||cw	'sudo su', 'sudo su -', 'sudo bash', 'sudo sh' all give you mixtures of environment variables from your user and your root. sudo -i is sane. See also !worksforme
2007-02-08T10:08:00.000Z	||cw	soundray	thanks, that makes sense.  though I've been using su for years and the - is supposed to make a new clean env.  I would agree that just su can make with the confusion
