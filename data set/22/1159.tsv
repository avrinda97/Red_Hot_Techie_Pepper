2011-07-27T14:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	alaing	 why are you usig ftp anyway. why not ssh or samba
2011-07-27T14:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	alaing	 yes
2011-07-27T14:08:00.000Z	alaing	dr_willis	 i tried winscp but it just never seemed to work
2011-07-27T14:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	alaing	 works fine for me...
2011-07-27T14:12:00.000Z	alaing	dr_willis	 i'm using vsftpd server
2011-07-27T14:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	alaing	 i dont use ftp servers any more. just ssh/scp these days.
2011-07-27T14:13:00.000Z	alaing	dr_willis	check my other msgs what could cause my win7 machien to simple hand putty
2011-07-27T14:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	alaing	 no idea. i use ssh/putty/winscp from win7 all the time with no issues
2011-07-27T14:15:00.000Z	alaing	dr_willis	would you mind helping me setup my connection??
2011-07-27T14:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	alaing	 i just install ssh server, and putty/winscp and often xming, i dont really setup anything special at all
2011-07-27T14:17:00.000Z	alaing	dr_willis	how do i check what ssh server I'm running?
2011-07-27T14:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	alaing	 the default one most people use is the openssh-server
2011-07-27T14:20:00.000Z	alaing	dr_willis	i just checked my process and noticed sshd one running with would be openssh-server right?
2011-07-27T14:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	alaing	 if thats the one you installed..
2011-07-27T14:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	alaing	 ssh -v localhost    tells version at top also..
2011-07-27T14:24:00.000Z	alaing	dr_willis	 Open SSH 5.8 but it says the connection refused
2011-07-27T14:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	alaing	 you cant ssh to yourself? you are doing this as a user
2011-07-27T14:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	alaing	 you must tell it the port to use then
2011-08-02T23:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	alaing	 cp -R foo bar
2011-08-02T23:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	alaing	  You really may want to go spend some time reading some command line basics guides.. :)
2011-08-02T23:21:00.000Z	alaing	dr_willis	i'll work through that tutorial
