2006-10-21T11:39:00.000Z	protex		Hello guys! I'm about to be a new Ubuntu user; I'm moving over from Gentoo, just burning the install now. =] 
2006-10-21T11:39:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	protex	Awesome :)
2006-10-21T11:44:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	protex	I would suggest to install from the Alternate cd and build from there.
2006-10-21T11:44:00.000Z	protex	ianmacgregor	Aye, the alternate CD differs in which way?
2006-10-21T11:44:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	protex	It's a text-based installer.. and since you're coming from gentoo, I would think you can handle it
2006-10-21T11:45:00.000Z	protex	ianmacgregor	Oh, awesome. =). Although I've never install Ubuntu before, so does that text installer have instructions?
2006-10-21T11:45:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	protex	The desktop cd is a livecd with a gui installer, but I have never used it
2006-10-21T11:45:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	protex	It's quite easy to understand.. I know an 8 year old who used it and didn't have any questions until the partitioning section :)
2006-10-21T11:59:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	protex	I use only those and they have tons of stuff in them
2006-10-21T12:00:00.000Z	protex	ianmacgregor	Alright awesome! I'm looking specifically for the nvidia beta drivers, and beryl
2006-10-21T12:33:00.000Z	protex	ianmacgregor	Will that alternate CD allow me to customize my partitioning scheme?
2006-10-21T12:33:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	protex	Yes, I use it to setup my own parition scheme before installiung
2006-10-21T12:34:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	protex	I have a feeling you're going to like the alternate cd
2006-10-21T12:34:00.000Z	protex	ianmacgregor	And what is Ubuntu's default? I, personally use XFS. Does Ubuntu have any need for certain folders to be mounted on seperate paritions? (as /usr/portage/) in gentoo
2006-10-21T12:35:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	protex	No idea about that, I just always use ext3 and the only custom thing I do is have /home on /dev/hdb1
2006-10-21T12:36:00.000Z	protex	ianmacgregor	Alrighty, thank you. =)
2006-10-21T12:44:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	protex	:)

2006-10-21T12:45:00.000Z	protex	ianmacgregor	Alright, I have my crappy laptop on next to me, I'm going to join this channel from there so I can ask for guidance if need be
2006-10-21T12:46:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	protex	Good idea
2006-10-21T12:46:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	protex	crappy laptop? you mean a craptop?
2006-10-21T12:46:00.000Z	protex	ianmacgregor	Precisely! P2 400mhz, meh get's the job done
