2007-11-17T07:51:00.000Z	jessd	cake45	It tells tar to extract a gzip file and tell you what it decompresses as it does it
2007-11-17T07:52:00.000Z	cake45	jessd	I dled a gzip and it gives me an error when I run that command
2007-11-17T07:52:00.000Z	jessd	cake45	What's the error?
2007-11-17T07:53:00.000Z	jessd	cake45	Do "ls -lh ndiswrapper-1.49.tar.gz"
2007-11-17T07:53:00.000Z	jessd	cake45	Does that return anything?
2007-11-17T07:53:00.000Z	jessd	cake45	Try cd ~/Desktop
2007-11-17T07:54:00.000Z	jessd	cake45	then try the ls command again

2007-11-17T07:55:00.000Z	jessd	cake45	awesome; now it should decompress for you
2007-11-17T07:56:00.000Z	jessd	cake45	Put the word tar in front of that last command
2007-11-17T07:57:00.000Z	jessd	cake45	tar is the command, -zxcf are the options you're passing to it
2007-11-17T08:01:00.000Z	jessd	cake45	sudo
2007-11-17T08:15:00.000Z	cake45	jessd	justin@ubuntu3:~/Desktop/ndiswrapper-1.49$ sudo ndiswrapper -i bcmwl5.inf
2007-11-17T08:15:00.000Z	jessd	cake45	Sorry, my card doesn't use ndiswrapper
