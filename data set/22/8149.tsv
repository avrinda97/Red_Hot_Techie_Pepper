2006-02-20T09:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		Only one Freenode staff on right now!
2006-02-20T09:01:00.000Z	elkbuntu	tonyyarusso	then get them here
2006-02-20T09:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	elkbuntu	Trying.
2006-02-20T12:59:00.000Z	elkbuntu	tonyyarusso	Longhorn is going to need it, apparantly ;)
2006-02-20T12:59:00.000Z	elkbuntu	tonyyarusso	so you'll be hearing more about 4gb ram ;)
2006-02-20T13:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	elkbuntu	You mean that-which-is-totally-unnecessary-for-me-to-blow-good-money-on-now-that-I've-seen-the-light-of-Linux of course, right? ;)
2006-02-20T13:00:00.000Z	elkbuntu	tonyyarusso	no. you asked who needs 4gb ram... longhorn users will ;) and of course imagine the speeeeeed
2006-02-20T13:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	elkbuntu	However, I have seen the sysreqs of Longhorn/Vista/whatever we'll call it, and frankly I think it's f*&%ing ridiculous.
2006-02-20T13:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	elkbuntu	Yes, the speed, of my wallet emptying to buy that much RAM.
2006-02-20T13:01:00.000Z	elkbuntu	tonyyarusso	i know. when's it supposely due out? 3rd quarter? i'm yet to see a 4ghz processor on the market
2006-02-20T13:01:00.000Z	elkbuntu	tonyyarusso	well, local market
2006-02-20T13:02:00.000Z	elkbuntu	tonyyarusso	it's going to flop unless they reassess reality
2006-02-20T13:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	elkbuntu	Whenever the heck they feel like it.  Last I heard was only "expected before the end of the year", but see IE7 for M$ timetables.
2006-02-20T13:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	elkbuntu	Especially if we can do something about it it will!  (I blog about Ubuntu occasionally, who else does?  Planning to chronicle an entire Dapper install to use experience.)
2006-02-20T13:04:00.000Z	elkbuntu	tonyyarusso	i dont see them making the best of the opportunity, they're getting way ahead of themselves if they expect people to be able to afford both a new OS and whizz bang hardware to run it on
2006-02-20T13:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	elkbuntu	That's what I said.  Upgrading OS: $2000 vs. 'apt-get dist-upgrade'  A toughie!
2006-02-20T13:05:00.000Z	elkbuntu	tonyyarusso	hehe. i wasnt arguing with that, but simply stating that i dont think we're going to need to worry much about LH because of it
2006-02-20T13:05:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	elkbuntu	I agree.
2006-06-02T06:57:00.000Z	elkbuntu	tonyyarusso	apt-cache policy <package> works also
2006-06-02T06:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	elkbuntu	Yes, it does.  Today I'm working on the assumption that a lot of people want GUI instructions though ;)
2006-06-02T06:59:00.000Z	elkbuntu	tonyyarusso	meh
2007-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	elkbuntu	tonyyarusso	yeah so stupid they're cute
