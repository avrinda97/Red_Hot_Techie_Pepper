2011-01-16T17:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	thauriswulfa	did you try change mirror site?
2011-01-16T17:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	thauriswulfa	what version of ubuntu are you running in this instance
2011-01-16T17:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	thauriswulfa	in the future put all you info on one line I missed your version because it had already scrolled off my screen and also harder for me to support you and others at the same time
2011-01-26T08:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	thauriswulfa	can you try fsck on the partition you have problems with?
2011-01-26T08:27:00.000Z	thauriswulfa	sacarlson	: wait i am givin a try
2011-01-26T08:29:00.000Z	thauriswulfa	sacarlson	here's the output of fsck , but still not mountable fsck from util-linux-ng 2.17.2
2011-01-26T08:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	thauriswulfa	so it tests clean?  show us fdisk -l
2011-01-26T08:31:00.000Z	thauriswulfa	sacarlson	nothing happened  . after executing that command
2011-01-26T08:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	thauriswulfa	also we should see /etc/fstab file contents,  does your user have priv to mount?
2011-01-26T08:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	thauriswulfa	you must be sudo to run fdisk   so sudo fdisk -l
2011-01-26T08:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	thauriswulfa	so nothing is mounted?
2011-01-26T08:35:00.000Z	thauriswulfa	sacarlson	output of /etc/fstab is herehttp://paste.ubuntu.com/558383/
2011-01-26T08:36:00.000Z	thauriswulfa	sacarlson	: what should i do?
2011-01-26T08:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	thauriswulfa	ok so witch one do we want to mount?
2011-01-26T08:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	thauriswulfa	try  sudo mkdir /mnt ; sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
2011-01-27T17:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	thauriswulfa	I don't see any package with that name but I do see php-mail  so maybe sudo apt-get install php-mail
2011-01-27T17:14:00.000Z	thauriswulfa	sacarlson	thanx
