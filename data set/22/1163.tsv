2011-01-12T00:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	sniperjo_	did you try CTRL+ALT+F2 to get to a tty.. ?
2011-01-12T00:53:00.000Z	sniperjo_	Scunizi	yeah, its weird, it changes the blue "no input screen" to a completely black screen.
2011-01-12T00:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	sniperjo_	can you boot into the rescue kernel?
2011-01-12T00:56:00.000Z	sniperjo_	Scunizi	no just goes black screen, but i can ssh into it
2011-01-12T00:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	sniperjo_	do you have an nvidia card?
2011-01-12T00:57:00.000Z	sniperjo_	Scunizi	GMA950 i think, riddled with problems...
2011-01-12T00:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	sniperjo_	that's it?  800x600?  yea.. issues with that card.. sorry I'm not good with diagnostics with that one.
2011-01-12T00:58:00.000Z	sniperjo_	Scunizi	its terrible, works with other monitors DVI and VGA  through the converter, just not with this monitor
2011-01-12T01:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	sniperjo_	perhaps when ssh'd into the machine you can "xrandr" and it should give you what the default values that are currently output to the monitor .. the one with an * will be the current default.. if there's nothing then you'll have to manually tell xrandr what to use
2011-01-12T01:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	sniperjo_	also  if the wrong one is chosen ie resolution and refresh rate.. you can change that as well.
2011-01-12T01:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	sniperjo_	sounds like xrandr couldn't pick up any data from the monitor so it didn't know how to address it.
2011-01-12T01:04:00.000Z	sniperjo_	Scunizi	i know all the specs for the monitor
2011-01-12T01:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	sniperjo_	then type xrandr in cli of the ssh window and see what the system report
2011-01-12T01:05:00.000Z	sniperjo_	Scunizi	 http://pastebin.com/hhCNVCmh
2011-01-12T01:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	sniperjo_	looks like the vfreq and hfreq is WAY out of spec.. should be closer to 55 or 60
2011-01-12T01:06:00.000Z	sniperjo_	Scunizi	i cant xrandr because im ssh from a remote comp
2011-01-12T01:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	sniperjo_	it's not a gui app.. and will work on cli
2011-01-12T01:06:00.000Z	sniperjo_	Scunizi	that is the output from get-edid | parse-edid
2011-01-12T01:07:00.000Z	sniperjo_	Scunizi	 do i need to export DISPLAY or something ? otherwise i get "cant open display" with xrandr
2011-01-12T01:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	sniperjo_	hummm... not sure.. I'll have ubottu send you the help link on xrandr and resolution.. both links might shed some light on it.  The temp method would also be to do what the previous persion mentioned and add vga to xorg.conf.. sorry can't help with that one.
2011-01-12T01:11:00.000Z	sniperjo_	Scunizi	but if i run xrandr from a remote ssh it runs differently, dont i need to export the display or something
2011-01-12T01:11:00.000Z	sniperjo_	Scunizi	as if i was trying to run an app on the host computer
