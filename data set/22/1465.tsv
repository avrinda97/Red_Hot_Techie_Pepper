2010-08-24T17:09:00.000Z	mae_tae		hi people, i tried to implement thin client but i found an error in installing ltsp-client-core, it says cannot be installed on this regular machine, how do i fix this?
2010-08-24T17:11:00.000Z	moldy	mae_tae	which command did you run exactly?
2010-08-24T17:12:00.000Z	mae_tae	moldy	when i tried to install openssh-server
2010-08-24T17:12:00.000Z	moldy	mae_tae	we need to know the exact commands you entered, otherwise we will not be able to help
2010-08-24T17:13:00.000Z	mae_tae		moldy the client can now receive the ip address from the server but it seems it fails on TFTP
2010-08-24T17:13:00.000Z	moldy	mae_tae	check your server-side tftp logs
2010-08-24T17:14:00.000Z	mae_tae	moldy	what directory and what file? sorry im new to networking
2010-08-24T17:15:00.000Z	mae_tae	moldy	do i need also to modify /etc/network/interface? do i need to assign IP address on their?
2010-08-24T17:16:00.000Z	moldy	mae_tae	usually not
2010-08-24T17:16:00.000Z	moldy	mae_tae	i'd run tftpd in the foreground to see what is going on
2010-08-24T17:16:00.000Z	moldy	mae_tae	stop the running tftpd, then run "tftpd -L"
2010-08-24T17:18:00.000Z	mae_tae	moldy	ah ok, again, so its just fine if i dont assign any IP on interface?
2010-08-24T17:19:00.000Z	moldy	mae_tae	no, your server must have an ip address, of course
2010-08-24T17:19:00.000Z	moldy	mae_tae	and it must be a fixed one
2010-08-24T17:20:00.000Z	moldy	mae_tae	it does not matter *how* the server gets the address, but it must have one
2010-08-24T17:20:00.000Z	mae_tae	moldy	it seems that error comes out when i tried to install openssh-server, it came out that blue dialog box, and displays ltsp-client-core cannot be installed on this machine
2010-08-24T17:20:00.000Z	moldy	mae_tae	you still did not give me the exact commands you were running. i cannot help without them.
2010-08-24T17:20:00.000Z	mae_tae	moldy	i see, so that means on example eth0, i will assign a fixed IP address
2010-08-24T17:21:00.000Z	moldy		i have no idea where, why and how you were trying  to install openssh-server
2010-08-24T17:21:00.000Z	moldy		i cannot help you if you don't give me more exact information
2010-08-24T17:22:00.000Z	mae_tae	moldy	its alright, sorry i can no longer try it again, im no longer in the lab, but what i remember example when i try this command sudo apt-get install openssh-server, thats all
2010-08-24T17:25:00.000Z	mae_tae	moldy	seems this command ltsp-update-sshkeys, i remember when i type that it seems that i wasnt install something like that
