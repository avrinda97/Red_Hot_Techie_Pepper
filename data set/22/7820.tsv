2006-09-19T08:54:00.000Z	fredl		how does NetworkManager get started up? I don't find it in any rc files
2006-09-19T08:55:00.000Z	ubuntu	fredl	 /etc/init.d/networking ??
2006-09-19T08:55:00.000Z	fredl	ubuntu	nope. The NetworkManager daemon
2006-09-19T08:55:00.000Z	ubuntu	fredl	 try this , as rot type network-admin
2006-09-19T08:56:00.000Z	fredl	ubuntu	network-manager, not network-admin :)
2006-09-19T08:56:00.000Z	fredl	ubuntu	network-manager is supposed to automatically detect wireless networks.
2006-09-19T08:57:00.000Z	fredl	ubuntu	ok, sorry for misunderstanding you then, lemme start up network-admion
2006-09-19T08:58:00.000Z	fredl	ubuntu	so where in network-admin do I find anything about how NetworkManager is started up?
2006-09-19T08:58:00.000Z	fredl	ubuntu	yes I do. that's been there forever. But it doesn't mention anything about network-manager
2006-09-19T08:59:00.000Z	ubuntu	fredl	 clik on ur connection, there and choose activate
2006-09-19T09:00:00.000Z	fredl	ubuntu	I know, I'm talking over the connection right now. I think you're misunderstanding me...
2006-09-19T09:01:00.000Z	fredl	ubuntu	my aironet card works fine, there's no problem there. But recently some news has been released about network-manager, I guess it's a tool that comes from Fedora. It should detect multiple wireless networks and give you a choice which one to connect to
2006-09-19T09:01:00.000Z	fredl	ubuntu	don't worry about it :) you try :)
2006-09-19T09:01:00.000Z	ubuntu	fredl	 i dont think there is anything like network -manager on ubuntu
2006-09-19T09:01:00.000Z	fredl	ubuntu	yes there is :) apt-get install network-manager
2006-09-19T09:02:00.000Z	fredl	ubuntu	it actually starts up a daemon called NetworkManager and it listens to wireless interface (as well as wired interfaces for that matter) for network SID's
2006-09-19T09:03:00.000Z	fredl	ubuntu	problem is that the NetworkManager daemon doesn't see my card :/
2006-09-19T09:03:00.000Z	ubuntu	fredl	 i c
2006-09-19T09:03:00.000Z	fredl	ubuntu	despite it being an aironet card.
2006-09-19T09:03:00.000Z	ubuntu	fredl	ndiswraooer?
2006-09-19T09:04:00.000Z	fredl	ubuntu	no, the aironet is recognized natively by Linux
2006-09-19T09:04:00.000Z	fredl	ubuntu	which was a good reason to purchase it.
