2008-10-15T23:52:00.000Z	jharkn		sounds like macvr's menu.lst maybe wasn't updated?
2008-10-15T23:54:00.000Z	macvr	jharkn	i checked the menu.lst i have 3 options.> default, 24-21, 24-19 ... default points to initrd.gz which has kernel 24-19 is this normal?
2008-10-15T23:55:00.000Z	macvr	jharkn	what kernel are u using?
2008-10-15T23:56:00.000Z	jharkn	macvr	sounds like you need to change your menu.lst to me, I'm on arch though personally, not ubuntu (well I do have ubuntu on a partition)
2008-10-15T23:58:00.000Z	jharkn	macvr	when I updated my ubuntu kernel last the menu.lst update was interactive and I could choose to do it manually.  maybe you did that by accident?
2008-10-15T23:59:00.000Z	macvr	jharkn	i didnt get the gurb update :( are using 24-21?
2008-10-16T00:00:00.000Z	jharkn	macvr	just update your menu.lst manually, that's what I'd do. no I'm not, I'm on 2.6.27-ARCH.
2008-10-16T00:00:00.000Z	macvr	jharkn	do u have a /boot/initrd.gz file?
2008-10-16T00:01:00.000Z	jharkn	macvr	I'll check my /boot now for ya
2008-10-16T00:04:00.000Z	jharkn	macvr	on my ubuntu /boot I have no initrd.gz but I'm not up-to-date either
2008-10-16T00:04:00.000Z	jharkn	macvr	but I'd guess you shouldn't have one unless you did it yourself
2008-10-16T00:05:00.000Z	macvr	jharkn	i think that newer versions dont have /boot/initrd.gz i heard that intrepid doesnt have that file too...
2008-10-16T00:05:00.000Z	jharkn	macvr	initrd.img-2.6.24-19-generic is what I have
2008-10-16T00:06:00.000Z	macvr	jharkn	i have that too..
2008-10-16T00:06:00.000Z	macvr	jharkn	thats my third option..
2008-10-16T00:08:00.000Z	jharkn	macvr	do you have an equivalent file for the latest kernel?
2008-10-16T00:08:00.000Z	jharkn	macvr	and a vmlinuz of course...
2008-10-16T00:09:00.000Z	macvr	jharkn	i have the /boot/initrd.img-2.6.24-21-generic and else... i could toggle the options... but i dont know if it is normal to hav the default option to remain at the older kernel after an update?
2008-10-16T00:10:00.000Z	jharkn	macvr	no it isn't otherwise it wouldn't bother updating ;)
2008-10-16T00:13:00.000Z	jharkn	macvr	if you have both of: /boot/initrd.img-2.6.24-21-generic vmlinuz-2.6.24-21-generic
2008-10-16T00:13:00.000Z	jharkn	macvr	then update your grub.lst manually
2008-10-16T00:14:00.000Z	jharkn	macvr	paste your menu.lst
