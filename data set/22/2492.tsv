2009-06-01T13:09:00.000Z	ignusb		hello. I've just installed ubuntu 9.04 on my desktop from the live-cd, now getting "GRUB - Error 17" every time I try to boot. I've tried a filesystem check/repair on each of the partitions of the HDD it's installed on, I've tried re-installing/re-configuring GRUB, and it stays as just Error 17. My config is 3 HDD's, ubuntu installed on the 3rd HDD as seen in the BIOS, WXP installed on the 1st, I'd like to be able to dual boot. At the moment,
2009-06-01T13:09:00.000Z	ignusb		I can't single boot however, so that would be a nice start. Any suggestions from anyone of what I can do next?
2009-06-01T13:10:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	what does grub error 17 mean?
2009-06-01T13:13:00.000Z	ignusb	Slart	I can't work out what error 17 is, though it appears to be when GRUB can find the partition, but can't mount it for some reason, possibly that it doesn't recognise the FS. I used the ubuntu auto-partition thing, so it's set to ext3
2009-06-01T13:14:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	did you have a pastebin of your /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
2009-06-01T13:15:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	blank? ehm.. that's bad.. really sure it's blank?
2009-06-01T13:15:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	what's the setup of your machine? ubuntu version? number of drives? separate partitions for things?
2009-06-01T13:18:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	ah.. that would explain it.. so now you have a menu.lst file, right?
2009-06-01T13:19:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	ok.. let's see what we can do... if you open the file up you'll first see a lot of text.. comments and settings bla bla bla..some way down in the file you'll see a list of kernels.. about 5 lines for each kernel.. do you see that part?
2009-06-01T13:20:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	if you look at my file at http://pastebin.com/f40922f2d  , the part I'm talking about starts at line 133
2009-06-01T13:22:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	have you edited this file by hand?
2009-06-01T13:24:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	hmm.. let me check some stuff.. you've got some strange things in your file but I'm not sure if it's something they've changed in jaunty
2009-06-01T13:28:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	ok, it was as I suspected.. it's a new jaunty thing.. your menu.lst file looks ok
2009-06-01T13:30:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	nah... from what I can tell your menu.lst file looks ok... the uuid's might be wrong but I don't really know how to check that
2009-06-01T13:31:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	I would try reinstalling grub, just because it's a pretty easy and quick solution if it works
2009-06-01T13:32:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	you're not using some BIOS feature to select which hard drive to boot from?
2009-06-01T13:32:00.000Z	ignusb	Slart	not that I'm aware of.
2009-06-01T13:33:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	no need to check.. you would know if you were =)
2009-06-01T13:33:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	some BIOS have a little boot menu of their own.. where the different drives popup and you can select one to boot from
2009-06-01T13:34:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	then try a reinstall of grub.. if that doesn't fix it write a post on the forums
2009-06-01T13:35:00.000Z	ignusb	Slart	already reinstalled twice, so to the forums it is.
2009-06-01T13:36:00.000Z	Slart	ignusb	you're welcome.. hope you get it fixed
