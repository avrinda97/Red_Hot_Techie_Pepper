2007-06-15T12:37:00.000Z	crabgrass		here's my situation: i had a cdrom drive in my machine when i installed, so grub was made including that drive, then i removed it and put a dvdrw in its place... and now i can't read off the drive. do i need to rebuild grub?
2007-06-15T12:38:00.000Z	slytherin	crabgrass	What has grub to do with cd drive?
2007-06-15T12:39:00.000Z	crabgrass	slytherin	i don't know... it reads from a file when it boots, yes?
2007-06-15T12:39:00.000Z	slytherin	crabgrass	Grub is installed to your hard disk.
2007-06-15T12:40:00.000Z	crabgrass	slytherin	well, then, what controls how ubuntu accesses my ide drives?
2007-06-15T12:41:00.000Z	slytherin	crabgrass	Let's first separate the problems you have. What are you exactly trying to do? Access the newly installed DVD drive or what?
2007-06-15T12:42:00.000Z	crabgrass	slytherin	right now i'm trying to rip an audio cd, and it's not detecting the drive
2007-06-15T12:43:00.000Z	crabgrass	slytherin	also, i'd like to 'clean up' grub, if there's any sort of reconfigure option... i'm getting a whole lot of strange messages at boot
2007-06-15T12:43:00.000Z	slytherin	crabgrass	You may need to edit /etc/fstab and replace /dev/something with new value
2007-06-15T12:44:00.000Z	slytherin	crabgrass	For grub cleaning you can try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub'
2007-06-15T12:44:00.000Z	crabgrass	slytherin	and if that kills my machine, how do i get it back, assuming i made a backup?
2007-06-15T12:45:00.000Z	slytherin	crabgrass	It won't kill.
2007-06-15T12:48:00.000Z	slytherin	crabgrass	ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/
2007-06-15T12:48:00.000Z	slytherin	crabgrass	you can always use normal entries instead of uuid i.e. /dev/something
2007-06-15T12:49:00.000Z	crabgrass	slytherin	would that have any benefit over uuid's?
2007-06-15T12:50:00.000Z	slytherin	crabgrass	No difference in case of optical drive, but UUID are prefered in case of hard disk IMHO
2007-06-15T12:50:00.000Z	crabgrass	slytherin	alright
2007-06-15T12:50:00.000Z	crabgrass	slytherin	why are they preferred?
2007-06-15T12:51:00.000Z	slytherin	crabgrass	Don't really have much info. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingUUID
2007-06-15T12:51:00.000Z	crabgrass	slytherin	thanks, reading
2007-06-15T12:52:00.000Z	crabgrass	slytherin	ah, i get it
