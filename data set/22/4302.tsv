2008-01-29T10:20:00.000Z	soldats	singlesun	huh. most of the apps in ubuntu are written in python
2008-01-29T10:21:00.000Z	singlesun	soldats	i mean... how do you launch the interactive interface to do programming in python on ubuntu... i just switched over from winblows a little while ago
2008-01-29T10:21:00.000Z	singlesun	soldats	is there a gui based app you can use... instead of running python in term?
2008-01-29T10:22:00.000Z	soldats	singlesun	open a terminal and type python. youll get the python interface. if you want the gui-ish one youll need to install "idle"
2008-01-29T10:22:00.000Z	singlesun	soldats	yeah... that is what i was referring to.... i will check out this idle package real quick. ;) thx man
