2007-06-21T11:20:00.000Z	unfo	k1gw1	good idea.
2007-06-21T11:30:00.000Z	unfo	k1gw1	if you report your idea at https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/+filebug they will consider it.
2007-06-21T11:30:00.000Z	unfo	k1gw1	want me to help you?
2007-06-21T11:30:00.000Z	k1gw1	unfo	what idea?
2007-06-21T11:30:00.000Z	unfo	k1gw1	to list a list of people who donated money
2007-06-21T11:31:00.000Z	k1gw1	unfo	ohhh, I was mostly joking, about the source code thing. That'd be unnecessary bloat, but I suppose a page online broken into levels might be okay. But I just donated $100 5 mins ago :-P
2007-06-21T11:31:00.000Z	unfo	k1gw1	thanks!
2007-06-21T11:37:00.000Z	unfo	k1gw1	when people donate money, their name should go on a page online
2007-06-21T11:38:00.000Z	k1gw1	unfo	I suppose it's not a bad idea.. offtopic for here, but could perhaps encourage more people to do so
2007-06-21T11:38:00.000Z	unfo	k1gw1	and also the list of people should be in the About Ubuntu... dialog box.
2007-06-21T11:38:00.000Z	unfo	k1gw1	i think it's an excellent idea.  why don't you report it?
2007-06-21T11:39:00.000Z	k1gw1	unfo	okay, where?
2007-06-21T11:40:00.000Z	unfo	k1gw1	use your ShipIt userid and password if you have one.
2007-06-21T11:41:00.000Z	unfo	k1gw1	i suggest you file 2 separate bug reports: 1. they should make a list online, and 2. they should add a list to the About Ubuntu... dialog box.
2007-06-21T11:43:00.000Z	unfo	k1gw1	i also suggest you file the 2nd bug in the binary package "gnome"
2007-06-21T11:55:00.000Z	unfo	k1gw1	i'm curious, did the bug filing work?
2007-06-21T11:55:00.000Z	k1gw1	unfo	i did the webpage one then got distracted haha
2007-06-21T11:56:00.000Z	unfo	k1gw1	thats ok :) what's the webpage one bug ID number?
2007-06-21T11:57:00.000Z	k1gw1	unfo	121499
2007-06-21T12:15:00.000Z	unfo	k1gw1	I see that Corey Burger forwarded your request to Mark Shuttleworth, the founder of the company behind Ubuntu.
2007-06-21T12:16:00.000Z	unfo	k1gw1	thanks for sending it :)
