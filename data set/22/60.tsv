2012-09-10T08:14:00.000Z	Dark-Magician-Gi		How do I save changes to /etc/default/grub?
2012-09-10T08:16:00.000Z	Dark-Magician-Gi		I don't understand. I'm in the '/etc/default/grub' file now. It doesn't list save as an option. It does list exit though.
2012-09-10T08:17:00.000Z	Dark-Magician-Gi		I've already edited it. I changed 'GRUB_DEFAULT=0' to 'GRUB_DEFAULT=4'
2012-09-10T08:18:00.000Z	nerdbromancer	Dark-Magician-Gi	you also need to update-grub as root
2012-09-10T08:18:00.000Z	Dark-Magician-Gi		Yeah, that I read. I'm not sure how to save the change first though.
2012-09-10T08:18:00.000Z	nerdbromancer		like after you have done the changes and saved them
2012-09-10T08:18:00.000Z	nerdbromancer	Dark-Magician-Gi	it should let you if you are root
2012-09-10T08:19:00.000Z	Dark-Magician-Gi		Hm, I'll take another look at it.
2012-09-10T08:22:00.000Z	Dark-Magician-Gi		I used 'suno nano /etc/default/grub' to access it.
2012-09-10T08:22:00.000Z	Dark-Magician-Gi		I clicked exit then save. Now it says Uncomment to disable graphical terminal/file name to write
2012-09-10T08:23:00.000Z	Dark-Magician-Gi		I have no idea what to do here.
2012-09-10T08:23:00.000Z	nerdbromancer	Dark-Magician-Gi	and suDO not suNo if thats what you were typing
2012-09-10T08:23:00.000Z	Dark-Magician-Gi		Yeah, sudo. That was a typo. Sorry.
2012-09-10T08:23:00.000Z	Dark-Magician-Gi		Options are: gethelp, cancel, dos format, mac format, append, prepend, backup file
2012-09-10T08:24:00.000Z	nerdbromancer	Dark-Magician-Gi	its all good, thats super strange though
2012-09-10T08:24:00.000Z	Dark-Magician-Gi		That is after I clicked exit>save
2012-09-10T08:24:00.000Z	nerdbromancer	Dark-Magician-Gi	nm, with nano you just exit and save
2012-09-10T08:25:00.000Z	nerdbromancer	Dark-Magician-Gi	you go to quit "and then its like  'you want to save' and you say 'yes, save it to grub'"
2012-09-10T08:25:00.000Z	Dark-Magician-Gi	nerdbromancer	I didn't get that.
2012-09-10T08:25:00.000Z	Dark-Magician-Gi		How do I confirm the file name. I guess it's 'append'?
2012-09-10T08:25:00.000Z	Dark-Magician-Gi		It's the only command I can think of it being.
2012-09-10T08:26:00.000Z	nerdbromancer	Dark-Magician-Gi	what tj said
