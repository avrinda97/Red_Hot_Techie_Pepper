2009-04-04T23:56:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	jdu: specifically, airodump to log packets, aireplay to inject & do known wifi attacks, and aircrack to recover passwords from logged traffic by airodump
2009-04-04T23:57:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	what driver?
2009-04-04T23:58:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	isn't that a wireless PCI card? I think it works out of the box, at least it does for me
2009-04-05T00:00:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	why? :P
2009-04-05T00:02:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	unpack it first.. tar -xzf driver.tar.gz
2009-04-05T00:02:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	unpack it: tar -xzf rt2500-cvs-daily.tar.gz
2009-04-05T00:06:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	exactly what i said: 'cd rt2500-cvs-daily'
2009-04-05T00:08:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	do an ls -l and check what new directory you got.. I dont know the actual name
2009-04-05T00:15:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	k
2009-04-05T00:16:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	just hit 'cd rt25[tab][enter]'
2009-04-05T00:18:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	exactly what i said :P
2009-04-05T00:19:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	no, apply common sense to what I said
2009-04-05T00:20:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	type 'cd rt25' hit TAB, hit ENTER
2009-04-05T00:21:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	I'm not really familiar with rt2500, but there usually is a 'Module' or 'module' driver.. just check if there is with 'ls'
2009-04-05T00:24:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	cd 'Module'
2009-04-05T00:24:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	'cd Module'**
2009-04-05T00:26:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	that's why I told you to check for a Module directory, make a pastebin of the output of 'ls'
2009-04-05T00:31:00.000Z	clearscreen	yup_	just make a pastebin :P
