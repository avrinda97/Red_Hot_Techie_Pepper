2006-01-07T12:54:00.000Z	PeteyPablo		how do i tar.gz a file from command line?
2006-01-07T12:55:00.000Z	PeteyPablo		?
2006-01-07T12:55:00.000Z	yaaar	PeteyPablo	you need to get the utility "tar" by apt-getting it, then read its man page for extraction usage
2006-01-07T12:55:00.000Z	PeteyPablo		i just want to archive some files.
2006-01-07T12:56:00.000Z	yaaar	PeteyPablo	wait, sorry, i'm nuts
2006-01-07T12:56:00.000Z	yaaar	PeteyPablo	you don't need to apt-get it
2006-01-07T12:56:00.000Z	PeteyPablo		i know ..
2006-01-07T12:56:00.000Z	PeteyPablo		so tar -c -gzip file ?
2006-01-07T12:56:00.000Z	yaaar	PeteyPablo	that i think will output it to stdout
2006-01-07T12:56:00.000Z	PeteyPablo		whats stdout ?
2006-01-07T12:57:00.000Z	PeteyPablo		i want to make a archive like archive manager does
2006-01-07T12:57:00.000Z	yaaar	PeteyPablo	in this case, the screen
2006-01-07T12:57:00.000Z	yaaar	PeteyPablo	you probably want to do      tar -xvzf outputfile.tgz inputfile
2006-01-07T12:57:00.000Z	yaaar	PeteyPablo	doh!@
2006-01-07T12:57:00.000Z	yaaar	PeteyPablo	you probably want to do      tar -cvzf outputfile.tgz inputfile
2006-01-07T12:58:00.000Z	yaaar	PeteyPablo	see, the -f option tells it to write the end result to a file....without it, it just spews into the screen (stdout)
2006-01-07T12:58:00.000Z	PeteyPablo	yaaar	tanks
2006-01-07T12:59:00.000Z	yaaar	PeteyPablo	however, you can redirect stdout to a file as well, or to another program....like this:    tar -czv inputfile >> outputfile.tgz
2006-01-07T13:00:00.000Z	yaaar	PeteyPablo	the >> takes the stdout and appends it to the end of a file (creating it if nonexistant). you can use > instead of >> to start at the beginning of the file instead of appending, overwriting anything that's there. and you can use | to send it to std input on another program
2006-01-07T13:01:00.000Z	PeteyPablo	yaaar	linux is so powerful :-P
2006-01-07T13:01:00.000Z	yaaar	PeteyPablo	well, more accurately, bash is powerful
2006-01-07T13:01:00.000Z	yaaar	PeteyPablo	but yes, it is.
