2008-05-24T16:06:00.000Z	dgz		guys, please tell me how am i supposed to install nvidia drivers since sudo tells me it's unable to resolve my host
2008-05-24T16:06:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	use: System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers
2008-05-24T16:06:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	to fix your unrelated sudo problem, pastebin your error and the command you run
2008-05-24T16:07:00.000Z	dgz	jrib	you know i wont do that, right?
2008-05-24T16:07:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	why?
2008-05-24T16:08:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	you just told me sudo "tells" you something.  I want to know exactly what it tells you.  Do you understand?
2008-05-24T16:09:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	good.  Now tell us the contents of your /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts files.  Use the pastebin
2008-05-24T16:10:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	it doesn't work because your sudo is already broken
2008-05-24T16:11:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	okay, but can you pastebin the files so we can help you?
2008-05-24T16:13:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	there's no other way
2008-05-24T16:13:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	well you can use nano instead of vi
2008-05-24T16:17:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	here's what mine looks like: http://paste.ubuntu.com/14298/
2008-05-24T16:17:00.000Z	dgz	jrib	what should i do then?
2008-05-24T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	change "jrib" to "krassi-desktop" in the file I pastebinned
2008-05-24T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	you are using System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers  to install them?
2008-05-24T16:55:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	better to use the repositories
2008-05-24T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	you get free security upgrades and your X doesn't break on kernel upgrades
2008-05-24T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	sure, or let the gui do it for you.  Same result
2008-05-24T17:00:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	it's a command you execute.  Nothing to edit
2008-05-24T17:01:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	verify xorg.conf is using the nvidia driver now
2008-05-24T17:03:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	you would need to restart X after you verify xorg.conf is in order
2008-05-24T17:04:00.000Z	jrib	dgz	save what you are working on, log out, hit ctrl-alt-backspace
