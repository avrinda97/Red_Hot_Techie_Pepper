2005-10-31T12:05:00.000Z	Severian	phiqtion	Install java first.  Then, just go to the azeurus site and install their installer.  It worked fine for me.
2005-10-31T12:08:00.000Z	phiqtion	Severian	which one?
2005-10-31T12:13:00.000Z	phiqtion	Severian	which one?
2005-10-31T12:14:00.000Z	Severian	phiqtion	which one what?
2005-10-31T12:14:00.000Z	phiqtion	Severian	azureus
2005-10-31T12:15:00.000Z	phiqtion	Severian	GTK or MOTIF?
2005-10-31T12:15:00.000Z	phiqtion	Severian	or source
2005-10-31T12:16:00.000Z	Severian	phiqtion	I don't know what you are asking.  I installed the 1.5 version of Sun Jave and the latest azeurus.
2005-10-31T12:16:00.000Z	Severian	phiqtion	GTK
2005-10-31T12:16:00.000Z	phiqtion	Severian	GTK is a auto installer? how do i install it?
2005-10-31T12:17:00.000Z	Severian	phiqtion	the gtk libraries are already in Ubuntu.  They are an important part of GNOME.
2005-10-31T12:19:00.000Z	Severian	phiqtion	I had no dependancies to resolve when I installed azeurus, as long as I had a java runtime already installed.  I am research now to see if any jre besides Sun's should work.
2005-10-31T12:19:00.000Z	Severian	phiqtion	There is a wiki and a nice online forum.
2005-11-01T12:43:00.000Z	Severian	phiqtion	there is a way to use mplayer at the command line and have it save streams.  I have seen it done, but don't know the syntax, off hand.
2005-11-01T12:57:00.000Z	Severian	phiqtion	you could run a windows virtual machine in a vmware player hosted on Ubuntu.  But, why would you want to.  XP is awful.
2005-11-01T12:58:00.000Z	phiqtion	Severian	where can i get vmware from?
2005-11-01T12:59:00.000Z	Severian	phiqtion	www.vmware.com   The player itself is now free, but you have to have the commercial version($200) to create the virtual machines.
2005-11-01T13:23:00.000Z	Severian	phiqtion	Be aware that to do VMWare right you should have a gig of ram or better.
2005-11-01T13:24:00.000Z	phiqtion	Severian	i got 1gb and 2gb swap
2005-11-01T13:42:00.000Z	Severian	phiqtion	open another terminal prompt and type   which make
2005-11-01T13:42:00.000Z	phiqtion	Severian	thanks
