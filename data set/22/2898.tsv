2012-02-04T20:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danes	I'd check the HCL to see which work TBH
2012-02-04T20:18:00.000Z	danes	ActionParsnip	Whoa! I appreciate that you want to help but honestly I have no idea what those acronyms mean so I couldn't understand much
2012-02-04T20:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danes	HCL = hardware compatibility list
2012-02-04T20:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danes	TBH = to be honest
2012-02-04T20:19:00.000Z	danes	ActionParsnip	now that makes more sense hehe thanks. Any idea where can I find a list with compatible HW?

2012-02-11T23:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danes	you could have easily found those...
2012-02-11T23:20:00.000Z	danes	ActionParsnip	for some reason the privacy link is not installed/showing up in  my pc... Do I have to install something else?...
2012-02-11T23:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danes	not so far as I know, you can just manipulate the hidden files in $HOME
2012-04-07T19:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danes	tried a different browser?
2012-04-07T19:25:00.000Z	danes	ActionParsnip	not really, which one would you recommend?
2012-04-07T19:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danes	what have you tried?
2012-04-07T19:25:00.000Z	danes	ActionParsnip	firefox
2012-04-07T19:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danes	chromium maybe, its in the repos
2012-04-07T19:26:00.000Z	danes	ActionParsnip	is it a simplified version of google chrome?
2012-04-07T19:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danes	no, its the open source ne which chrome is based on (chrome adds a lot of proprietary lumps)
2012-04-07T19:27:00.000Z	danes	ActionParsnip	ok, thanks
2012-04-07T19:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danes	and no tracking stuff :)
2012-04-07T19:28:00.000Z	danes	ActionParsnip	excellent! that was my main concern. I always avoided chrome for that reason
