2006-06-07T13:16:00.000Z	Warbo	acke	Do you know about the sun-java5 packages?
2006-06-07T13:18:00.000Z	acke	Warbo	no i dont know about the. i got a jreversnumber.bin file that contains what i need i think i just need to get it running?!
2006-06-07T13:18:00.000Z	acke	Warbo	and i dont know how to install .bin files in linux
2006-06-07T13:19:00.000Z	Warbo	acke	It is quite simple to install so called ".bin" files, but I would not recommend it. There are packages in Synaptic called sun-java5-something (bin, doc, etc) which will be nice and update themselves and install dependencies and stuff. They are better than the bin file
2006-06-07T13:21:00.000Z	Warbo	acke	Also, unless you know you need java1.5 ("java5"), for example Azureus needs it, then you can install the slightly older j2re1.4 package
2006-06-07T13:26:00.000Z	acke	Warbo	thanks, yeah i need 1.5, as i need a specific package from that version. (java.util.concurrent). but yeah version 1.5.X was installed already thanks. just had to find it. now my environment complains on missing java VM..
2006-06-07T13:27:00.000Z	Warbo	acke	If you install galternatives and run it with sudo then you can set your system's default Java version (among other things)
2006-06-07T13:27:00.000Z	acke	Warbo	thanks installing it now

2006-06-07T13:30:00.000Z	Warbo	acke	Sorry, I've never used Eclipse. I do know that it likes to do it's own thing though, so it may be a problem with Eclipse's config rather than the system's
