2007-06-15T16:37:00.000Z	maccam94		someone please help me manually remove a package
2007-06-15T16:37:00.000Z	maccam94		synaptic and apt-get CANNOT remove it
2007-06-15T16:38:00.000Z	maccam94		anybody? please? this broken package has been annoying me for DAYS, and it's preventing synaptic from installing other unrelated packages >_<
2007-06-15T16:40:00.000Z	nickrud	maccam94	could you post the output of aptitude reinstall <brokenpackage> on a pastebin
2007-06-15T16:41:00.000Z	nickrud	maccam94	I've manually edited the pre & post rm scripts for packages in /var/lib/dpkg/info before when I've had issues like that
2007-06-15T16:41:00.000Z	maccam94	nickrud	sounds complicated
2007-06-15T16:41:00.000Z	nickrud	maccam94	usually not too. post the error from the aptitude run
2007-06-15T16:45:00.000Z	maccam94	nickrud	http://pastebin.com/929251 i highlighted a couple lines, because regardless of what I try to install it tries to install that package first
2007-06-15T16:46:00.000Z	nickrud	maccam94	is mysql running right now?
2007-06-15T16:47:00.000Z	nickrud	maccam94	ps -A | grep mysql will tell you; you'd have a task called mysqld if it's running
2007-06-15T16:48:00.000Z	maccam94	nickrud	i don't believe so, lemme double check
2007-06-15T16:49:00.000Z	nickrud	maccam94	if you do, kill it and mysqld_safe (if it's present)
2007-06-15T16:49:00.000Z	maccam94	nickrud	done
2007-06-15T16:51:00.000Z	nickrud	maccam94	ok, edit /var/lib/dpkg/mysql-server-5.0.prerm, and put exit 0 on line 2. Then run the remove again. This will skip trying to shut down mysql during the run
2007-06-15T16:55:00.000Z	maccam94	nickrud	ok, now it seems to be hanging on configuring the new mysql package
2007-06-15T16:57:00.000Z	nickrud	maccam94	try installing mysql-server-5.0
2007-06-15T16:59:00.000Z	nickrud	maccam94	similar enough, I'd say. Try simply removing mysql-server-5.0. Get that done
2007-06-15T05:00:00.000Z	nickrud	maccam94	and for luck, use purge
2007-06-15T05:00:00.000Z	maccam94	nickrud	tried purging it, and it failed
2007-06-15T05:01:00.000Z	nickrud	maccam94	it should, after that change we made
2007-06-15T05:02:00.000Z	nickrud	maccam94	all good now then?
2007-06-15T05:04:00.000Z	nickrud	maccam94	you should still have your database in /var/lib/mysql , just reinstall mysql & reattach ;)
