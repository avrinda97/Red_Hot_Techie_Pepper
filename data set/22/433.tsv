2011-10-06T22:24:00.000Z	griffrez		And after the update, Ubuntu started thinking that my hardware couldn't run Unity.
2011-10-06T22:24:00.000Z	griffrez		But it can, it was running in the beginning
2011-10-06T22:25:00.000Z	griffrez		siavash, I never installed drivers, to start off
2011-10-06T22:25:00.000Z	griffrez		I started Ubuntu for the first time
2011-10-06T22:25:00.000Z	griffrez		Started updating
2011-10-06T22:25:00.000Z	griffrez		And got that problem
2011-10-06T22:25:00.000Z	griffrez		It crashed
2011-10-06T22:25:00.000Z	griffrez		Sorry, ubottu
2011-10-06T22:25:00.000Z	griffrez		(probably a bot... but still.)
2011-10-06T22:26:00.000Z	griffrez		I'm doing the "Partial Upgrade" it is telling me to do.
2011-10-06T22:26:00.000Z	siavashserver	griffrez	which card? and which drivers? (open source iguess)
2011-10-06T22:26:00.000Z	griffrez		Siavash, my GPU is an ATI Radeon HD 4770. Drivers... the ones that come with Ubuntu's installation.
2011-10-06T22:27:00.000Z	siavashserver	griffrez	try installing prop drivers
2011-10-06T22:28:00.000Z	griffrez	siavashserver	I once had a small problem with prop drivers a little time ago
2011-10-06T22:28:00.000Z	griffrez		I installed it, and on the boot, Linux was outputting a video signal that my monitor could not interpret.
2011-10-06T22:28:00.000Z	siavashserver	griffrez	no issues here. catalyst 11.8 + radeonhd 4890
2011-10-06T22:29:00.000Z	griffrez	siavashserver	I think it has to do with the refresh rate my monitors give out to understand it can stand.
2011-10-06T22:30:00.000Z	griffrez	siavashserver	Then the driver starts sending signal at that RR that is not supported, crashing video signal.
2011-10-06T22:30:00.000Z	griffrez		I tried using the drivers that you can get on ATI's website itself and it worked
2011-10-06T22:30:00.000Z	siavashserver	griffrez	with opensource drivers?
2011-10-06T22:30:00.000Z	siavashserver		those issues ^
2011-10-06T22:31:00.000Z	griffrez	siavashserver	I had that problem with the drivers that come up with the Linux GUI
