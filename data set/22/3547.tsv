2008-08-08T11:38:00.000Z	xPhilosx		uhh, quick question, im using Ubuntu Hardy, no matter what I do after I edit /etc/network/interfaces, it refuses to assign a static IP
2008-08-08T11:39:00.000Z	xPhilosx		why wont Ubuntu allow me to manually configure my eth connections?
2008-08-08T11:39:00.000Z	xPhilosx		I end up with the same defaulted garbage each time I change my network interfaces file
2008-08-08T11:40:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	xPhilosx	it should, what's the problem?
2008-08-08T11:41:00.000Z	xPhilosx	joejoecircusboy	no idea, it keeps defaulting to a DHCP address
2008-08-08T11:42:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	xPhilosx	hmm did you disable "roaming" or whatever it's called
2008-08-08T11:42:00.000Z	xPhilosx	joejoecircusboy	 yeah, but it wont disable, roaming seems to be the only thing that works
2008-08-08T11:46:00.000Z	xPhilosx	joejoecircusboy	I think persistent rules was ruining me
2008-08-08T11:47:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	xPhilosx	persistence rules? Not familar with that...
2008-08-08T11:47:00.000Z	xPhilosx	joejoecircusboy	something that "helps" you by not allowing certain things to be changed, /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
2008-08-08T11:48:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	xPhilosx	oh, udev... ya ya... those are good things actually (I believe they ensure a given piece of hardware is always assigned the same device file)
2008-08-08T11:48:00.000Z	xPhilosx	joejoecircusboy	welp, ill see if that was my prob
2008-08-08T11:48:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	xPhilosx	Without that, you may find the ethernet devices change around (if you install a new one)
2008-08-08T12:35:00.000Z	xPhilosx	joejoecircusboy	i didnt try that yet, no
2008-08-08T12:33:00.000Z	xPhilosx	joejoecircusboy	have you ever had a problem with Ubuntu having a stranglehold on your network settings?
2008-08-08T12:34:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	xPhilosx	I think some of the files in /etc related to networking are generated from XML files (in gconf?)
2008-08-08T12:34:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	xPhilosx	To restore some temporary sanity, did you try chattr +i on your interface file?
2008-08-08T12:35:00.000Z	xPhilosx	joejoecircusboy	this is nuts, ifconfig gives me eth0 and eth2, i do sudo ifdown eth2 and it tells me eth2 isnt valid (and it shouldnt be, its not in my interfaces file)
2008-08-08T12:35:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	xPhilosx	that wll make the file immutable (not a solution, but will prevent it from being overwritten at least)
2008-08-08T12:36:00.000Z	xPhilosx	joejoecircusboy	its not being overwritten
2008-08-08T12:37:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	xPhilosx	See PM msg
2008-08-08T13:12:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	xPhilosx	yo
