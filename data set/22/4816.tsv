2007-11-30T23:23:00.000Z	insllvn		ok best i can figure this HDD is not formated, or is formated to some obscure BS proprietary format so is there a way to format an unlabeled disk?
2007-11-30T23:23:00.000Z	insllvn		possibly a command line option?
2007-11-30T23:25:00.000Z	insllvn		i can't find any info on the format command, does anyone know the syntax, and if/how i can point it at a specific directory/disk?
2007-11-30T23:25:00.000Z	Pici	insllvn	the command is mkfs, read the manpage.  Or use gparted/parted if you need more guidance
2007-11-30T23:26:00.000Z	insllvn	Pici	thank you
2007-11-30T23:33:00.000Z	insllvn	Pici	I get "file too large while trying to determine filesystem size" the drive is 160GB
2007-11-30T23:33:00.000Z	Pici	insllvn	with which tool?
2007-11-30T23:34:00.000Z	Pici	insllvn	Do you have a gui on that computer, gparted is much easier to use
2007-11-30T23:38:00.000Z	Pici	insllvn	I believe there is a 'capabilities' (or similar) option somewhere in gparted, does it list labelling for your filesystem type?
2007-11-30T23:42:00.000Z	insllvn	Pici	Show Features perhaps? the whole thing is unallocated at the current time
2007-11-30T23:43:00.000Z	Pici	insllvn	ah, okay. Why dont you go ahead and make the filesystem, format it and worry about the label afterwards?
2007-11-30T23:44:00.000Z	insllvn	Pici	i only have the option to set the label, it grays out practically everything else
2007-11-30T23:47:00.000Z	Pici	insllvn	Have you created a parition yeT?
2007-11-30T23:48:00.000Z	insllvn	Pici	almost all my options are grayed out in gparted. there are currently no partitions, and no way i can see to make one
2007-11-30T23:48:00.000Z	Pici	insllvn	How did you run gparted?
2007-11-30T23:52:00.000Z	insllvn	Pici	I don't see a tools menu... I have GParted, Edit, View, Device, Partition, Help
2007-11-30T23:52:00.000Z	Pici	insllvn	How did you start gparted?
2007-11-30T23:54:00.000Z	insllvn	Pici	I started it from System>Administration i thought you meant a tools menu in GParted
2007-11-30T23:54:00.000Z	Pici	insllvn	Nope, Did it prompt you for the root password when you started it?
2007-11-30T23:55:00.000Z	Pici	insllvn	You could try doing it from the LiveCD or from a Gparted LiveCD, I've never had issues with either of those.
2007-12-01T00:00:00.000Z	insllvn	Pici	thanks for the help I will try from the live CD
2007-12-01T00:01:00.000Z	Pici	insllvn	good luck
