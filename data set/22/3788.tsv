2008-07-17T17:04:00.000Z	chao1		does anyone know of a way to recover data from a corrupted ext3 filesystem?
2008-07-17T17:04:00.000Z	chao1		:'(
2008-07-17T17:06:00.000Z	chao1		well I dont see it when I open places
2008-07-17T17:06:00.000Z	chao1		in ubuntu
2008-07-17T17:06:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	were you able to see it before ?
2008-07-17T17:07:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	okay, check out that data recovery page i'd suggest and look into ddrescue
2008-07-17T17:11:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	do you have a live cd at hand ?
2008-07-17T17:15:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	if you could paste it on the net somewhere and give us the link people can take a look yes
2008-07-17T17:16:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	always a good idea to let several people take a peak, far from an expert in data recovery personally
2008-07-17T17:17:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	yes, ask away
2008-07-17T17:19:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	do you know what filesystem(s) the disk in question has ? fsck can do some repair attempts, but you'll need to know the correct switches, look at the "man fsck", i'm doing the same as we type
2008-07-17T17:20:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	ok thx, i'll try to put together a fsck command you can run from live cd, just don't try to mount the partition in question, that could make things worse
2008-07-17T17:26:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	no rush
2008-07-17T17:28:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	yes, a paste service, plenty of those around, just provide us with the link here after you pasted that log
2008-07-17T17:37:00.000Z	chao1	glitsj16	what now?
2008-07-17T17:39:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	there's a few unrecovered read errors in there, boot from live cd like mechdave suggested and run "fsck /dev/sda2 (if that is the correct partition, thought you mentioned that during the conversation here) ..
2008-07-17T17:42:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	fsck /dev/sda2 will do i think, if not, run an extra fsck on all of them, doens't hurt
2008-07-17T17:43:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	that's from the live cd you ran that ?
2008-07-17T17:51:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	going over the man page for fsck, i do think you should run it from a live cd, now fsck relies on your /etc/fstab to run the checks and that doesn't seem to work
2008-07-17T17:53:00.000Z	chao1	glitsj16	I will be back
2008-07-17T17:53:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	okay, goodluck
2008-07-17T18:07:00.000Z	glitsj16	chao1	wb, any luck running the fsck command ?
