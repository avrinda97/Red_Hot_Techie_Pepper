2007-08-06T08:52:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		Also too, I am talking about an NTFS external USB hard drive.  Does NTFS-3G work well with external hard drives when writing to them?  Windows is NOT on this external hard drive.. obviously.
2007-08-06T08:52:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	External and internal drives will work the same
2007-08-06T08:56:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	No (well, except with third party drivers)
2007-08-06T08:57:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	or NTFS with ntfs-3g
2007-08-06T10:36:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	Because it's not patented
2007-08-06T10:37:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	I didn't, no
2007-08-06T10:38:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	yeah, that's why it's in universe and not multiverse
2007-08-06T10:40:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	well, they do care.  They can't do anything about it though.
2007-08-06T10:43:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	Flannel	if microsoft does care about NTFS-3G, why don't they bother to fight it?  Maybe they don't want to bother fighting something so small?
2007-08-06T10:44:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	because they have no legal grounds to fight it.
2007-08-06T10:45:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	Lets move this to #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-08-07T10:11:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	home is your leftover space (since it's the place all your personal stuffs goes).  / can be... uh, 30GB will be more than enough.  10GB is probably more too.
2007-08-08T13:29:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	no, logical partitions go inside of extended partitions
2007-08-08T13:29:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	Flannel	do I need to make any primary partitions?
2007-08-08T13:30:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	Flannel	can I take the free space, and make the swap, /, and /home all logical drives?
2007-08-08T13:30:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	Yep.  Make the freespace one large extended partition, and then put the logical stuff inside of that
2007-08-08T13:31:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	Flannel	I'm at the setup wizard now.
2007-08-08T13:31:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	logicals only exist in an extended.  I don't think you'll be able to create logicals without an extended
2007-08-08T13:32:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	Flannel	so if I create swap, /, and /home as logical partitions, ubuntu will create an extended drive out of /dev/hda, and place these logical drives inside of it????
2007-08-08T13:34:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	I don't know.  Logicals *cannot* exist outside of an extended.  I don't think you're able to create logical before creating an extended.  Just make a single extended partition using all the free space, and then logicals inside of that.
2007-08-08T13:34:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	alright, then make logicals
2008-07-27T06:18:00.000Z	Flannel	CheeseGardener	#ubuntu-offtopic would be the appropriate place
