2008-12-08T19:10:00.000Z	jim_p	Pnux	what is the name of the package you searched for removal?

2008-12-08T19:11:00.000Z	jim_p	Pnux	i would go with cups-common
2008-12-08T19:12:00.000Z	Pnux	jim_p	scary.. a few packages and ubuntu-desktop
2008-12-08T19:12:00.000Z	jim_p	Pnux	ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. it can be safely removed
2008-12-08T19:13:00.000Z	Pnux	jim_p	do i have to re instal it after removing?
2008-12-08T19:13:00.000Z	jim_p	Pnux	no. meta package = a package-shortcut of more packages
