2009-08-14T04:50:00.000Z	blknite		does anyone know how to reset the sudoers file -- I have added myself to a group and now no sudo and (default) no root passwd....:(...It is a complexed raid setup so I do not want to reinstall if I can help it
2009-08-14T04:52:00.000Z	mykola	blknite	have you accidentally removed yourself from the "wheel" group? if you have, just edit /etc/group and put yourself back
2009-08-14T04:54:00.000Z	blknite	mykola	no root?
2009-08-14T04:54:00.000Z	mykola	blknite	you need to be root to edit that file
2009-08-14T04:54:00.000Z	mykola	blknite	aah... right.
2009-08-14T04:55:00.000Z	mykola	blknite	fire up a recovery shell
2009-08-14T04:55:00.000Z	mykola	blknite	we can give you CLI instructions if you like
2009-08-14T04:55:00.000Z	blknite	mykola	Please
2009-08-14T04:56:00.000Z	mykola	blknite	allright. are you using the affected computer right now, or are you on another one?
2009-08-14T04:56:00.000Z	blknite	mykola	I'm on a good box..the other is next to me
2009-08-14T04:57:00.000Z	mykola	blknite	great :) reboot and select the recovery option from grub when it comes up (you may have to hit escape)
2009-08-14T04:58:00.000Z	mykola	blknite	it should drop you into a simple root shell
2009-08-14T05:01:00.000Z	mykola	blknite	you still there? :)
2009-08-14T05:02:00.000Z	blknite	mykola	yes...got a phone call...
2009-08-14T05:03:00.000Z	mykola	blknite	k then :) when you are in the root shell, nano /etc/group
2009-08-14T05:03:00.000Z	blknite	mykola	in the shell..THANK YOU!
2009-08-14T05:05:00.000Z	mykola	blknite	you got it from here? :D
2009-08-14T05:09:00.000Z	blknite	mykola	yes, thank you - you saved me hours and tears :)
2009-08-14T05:10:00.000Z	mykola	blknite	works now? :D
2009-08-14T05:10:00.000Z	mykola	blknite	nice ^_^
2009-08-14T05:10:00.000Z	mykola	blknite	for the future though, you may wanna password your grub... you know... easy root access and all? :)
2009-08-14T05:11:00.000Z	blknite	mykola	will do - thanks again
