2008-07-06T03:53:00.000Z	akuma5		have any of you setup a file server?
2008-07-06T03:53:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	yes
2008-07-06T03:55:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	ok, tell us what you have done so far and where you are encountering trouble at
2008-07-06T03:59:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	ok, and what are you having trouble with?
2008-07-06T04:00:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	why did you skip it, it's the most important part
2008-07-06T04:02:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	go through the how to again -- and when done, issue this command.  sudo mount -a .. when done, verify that the share is mounted with   mount
2008-07-06T04:02:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	yes, please
2008-07-06T04:05:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	the tutorial is asking you to edit the /etc/fstab file -- so you need to open it up like this.   gksu gedit /etc/fstab
2008-07-06T04:05:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	once you have the editor open -- make a new entry following the template given in the howto
2008-07-06T04:06:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	do you want to connect to a network share or do you want to setup a server?
2008-07-06T04:08:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	this howto is showing you how to connect to a share and created a "mapped drive" (in windows terminology) -- change that line there to something like //yourserver/sharename  /path/to/mountpoint smbfs  username=yourusername,password=yourPassWord 0 0
2008-07-06T04:10:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	take into consideration what Brandano just said too
2008-07-06T04:56:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	at a terminal
2008-07-06T04:56:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	enter that command and press RETURN when ready to execute it
2008-07-06T04:58:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	that command returns nothing if it completed successfully -- that command creates a directory for you - check to see if it was created
2008-07-06T04:58:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	what do you mean?
2008-07-06T04:59:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	well, ok - you have to have some experience understanding this error - it means that the directory /mount does not exist -- try using /media instead
2008-07-06T05:00:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	 sudo mkdir -v /media/my_share
2008-07-06T05:01:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	you could create /mount first and then create /mount/my_share -- but we already have a directory to house things like this -- so why not use it
2008-07-06T05:06:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	again, at a terminal
2008-07-06T05:06:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	make sure you substitute the right values there -- only you know what they are unfortunately :)
2008-07-06T05:06:00.000Z	unop	akuma5	they should be quite self-explanatory
