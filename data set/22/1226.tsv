2011-09-12T17:31:00.000Z	ahmad_		hi guys... im new to ubuntu and i got a question regarding Nvidia.
2011-09-12T17:32:00.000Z	ahmad_		my screen only gets to 640x480. i cant change it.
2011-09-12T17:33:00.000Z	ServerTech	ahmad_	nvidia graphics cards require third party drivers. Install the driver and it would be fine.
2011-09-12T17:34:00.000Z	ServerTech	ahmad_	enable the driver?
2011-09-12T17:35:00.000Z	ServerTech	ahmad_	not enabled then.
2011-09-12T17:36:00.000Z	ServerTech	ahmad_	i don't exactly remember the location:/ i would tell you after my ubuntu finishes installation
2011-09-12T17:37:00.000Z	ahmad_	ServerTech	ok thx :D
2011-09-12T17:38:00.000Z	ServerTech	ahmad_	^_^ do you have the nvidia settings application?
2011-09-12T17:38:00.000Z	ahmad_	ServerTech	yes
2011-09-12T17:39:00.000Z	ServerTech	ahmad_	which nvidia graphics card are we talking of here?
2011-09-12T17:40:00.000Z	ahmad_	ServerTech	Geforce 250GTS
2011-09-12T17:42:00.000Z	ServerTech	ahmad_	2560x1600 thats the maximum digital resolution. Open up the application and does it allow you to change the resolution? Also, is your monitor capable of going to such a resolution?
2011-09-12T17:43:00.000Z	ahmad_	ServerTech	i can only change to 640x480. My monitor is an 22" monitor that can handle 1,680 x 1,050.
2011-09-12T17:45:00.000Z	ServerTech	ahmad_	hold on. my gui update will finish in sometime.
2011-09-12T17:45:00.000Z	ahmad_	ServerTech	ok thx
