2006-10-28T15:24:00.000Z	marcin_ant		hi guys how can I test which sata driver is used by my machine?
2006-10-28T15:24:00.000Z	marcin_ant		I got asus p5b mobo and barracuda 7200.10 hdd which supports ncq
2006-10-28T15:26:00.000Z	dabaR	marcin_ant	does lsmod show anything about sata?
2006-10-28T15:27:00.000Z	marcin_ant	dabaR	yes it does
2006-10-28T15:27:00.000Z	dabaR	marcin_ant	what exactly? ?
2006-10-28T15:27:00.000Z	marcin_ant	dabaR	unfortunately it shows both two drivers
2006-10-28T15:28:00.000Z	marcin_ant	dabaR	ahci and ata_piix
2006-10-28T15:28:00.000Z	dabaR	marcin_ant	so you would like to know which one is used? I think both it both are shown.
2006-10-28T15:28:00.000Z	dabaR	marcin_ant	try modinfo <modName>
2006-10-28T15:29:00.000Z	marcin_ant	dabaR	ok there is some additional info but how can I get information which hdd uses which driver?
2006-10-28T15:30:00.000Z	dabaR	marcin_ant	they probably use both modules.
2006-10-28T15:30:00.000Z	marcin_ant	dabaR	ahci supports ncq and other nice toys, while ata_piix is older one and doesn't support ncq
2006-10-28T15:30:00.000Z	dabaR	marcin_ant	that is just a guess though, I have no idea.
2006-10-28T15:31:00.000Z	marcin_ant	dabaR	I got two sata controllers onboard - intel ich8 and jmicron...
2006-10-28T15:31:00.000Z	dabaR	marcin_ant	google a little with those models, to see what modules they use in linux is best advice I can come up with
2006-10-28T15:33:00.000Z	dabaR		!ru
2006-10-28T15:36:00.000Z	marcin_ant	dabaR	thanks for help I just found some usefull information in hal-device-manager
2006-10-28T15:37:00.000Z	dabaR	marcin_ant	welcome
2006-10-28T15:38:00.000Z	marcin_ant	dabaR	and now I know that my hdd which is connected to ich8 controller with ata_piix driver while jmicron controller uses ahci driver...
2006-10-28T15:38:00.000Z	dabaR	marcin_ant	cool
2006-10-28T15:39:00.000Z	marcin_ant	dabaR	cool that I got this info but it sucks that my machine uses this driver - need to reboot and change bios settings
2006-10-28T15:39:00.000Z	marcin_ant	dabaR	thanks again
