2010-01-02T01:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trism	gotcha, thanks :D
2010-01-03T00:46:00.000Z	trism	ActionParsnip	something like this maybe? http://x4.6times7.org/dokuwiki/doku.php/devlog/blog/streaming_on_ubuntu_8.04_with_pulseaudio
2010-02-19T21:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trism	I miss menu.lst. simpler times

2010-09-14T23:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trism	weird how it does that ain't it, considering file extensions are fairly meaningless
2010-09-14T23:24:00.000Z	trism	ActionParsnip	yes, but it seems to be the trend with many of the /etc config directories lately

2012-06-27T23:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trism	no idea what it does tbh, I just find links
2012-06-27T23:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	trism	seems I use a different internet than everyone else....

2012-10-19T07:19:00.000Z	trism	ActionParsnip	I think non-pae kernels were dropped completely in 12.10 so lubuntu or xubuntu probably won't help
