2005-09-28T05:10:00.000Z	sobersabre		is it safe to apt-get dist-upgrade to breezy from hoary ?
2005-09-28T05:12:00.000Z	looksaus	sobersabre	most of the time, breezy seems to be in a more or less releasable state
2005-09-28T05:13:00.000Z	looksaus		if you feel a bit adventurous
2005-09-28T05:13:00.000Z	sobersabre	looksaus	what are the unresolved problems ?

2005-09-28T05:15:00.000Z	looksaus		sobresabre, I've experienced little or no problems upgrading, but then again, I'm used to administering several server systems running Debian

2005-09-28T05:17:00.000Z	sobersabre		As long as my laptop boots, mounts and exec's it is enough. X is nice too... will I have these ?
