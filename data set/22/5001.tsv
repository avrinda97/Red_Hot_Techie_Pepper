2007-10-28T22:27:00.000Z	pga		I've just installed Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, because that's the CD I have for it, that was send to me by Canonical, how do I go on about upgrading from 6.06 to 7.10? sudo apt-get dist-ugrade?
2007-10-28T22:28:00.000Z	pga		shinao1 That's the problem, I don't see it in Update Manager, I've got 170 updates, to update, and none of them is dist-upgrade.
2007-10-28T22:28:00.000Z	Konam	pga	For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
2007-10-28T22:35:00.000Z	pga	Konam	Thanks. I have 6.06, and I want to install 7.10, Do I have to install 6.10, 7.04 THEN 7.10? Or can't I install straight-away to 7.10?
2007-10-28T22:37:00.000Z	Konam	pga	I think you can't go straight to 7.10
2007-10-28T22:38:00.000Z	pga	Konam	How about straight to 7.04? Oh man, upgrading to 6.10, 7.04, 7.10 eats up a lot of hdd space.
2007-10-28T22:39:00.000Z	Konam	pga	not really, the older packages are purged
2007-10-28T22:39:00.000Z	Konam	pga	I think the best you can do is order the 7.10 CDs and make a fresh install
2007-10-28T22:39:00.000Z	pga	Konam	I've ordered 6.06 LTS last year, and it showed up in my doorstep last month.
2007-10-28T22:41:00.000Z	Konam	pga	OMG!
2007-10-28T22:41:00.000Z	Konam	pga	that's weird
2007-10-28T22:42:00.000Z	pga	Konam	I'll just stick with 6.06 for now, cause it's LTS after all :)
2007-10-28T22:43:00.000Z	Konam	pga	that's the best thing you could do, do you have a good internet connection?
2007-10-28T22:44:00.000Z	pga	Konam	1Mbps here.
2007-10-28T22:44:00.000Z	Konam	pga	¬¬
2007-10-28T22:44:00.000Z	Konam	pga	you could download the latest version of ubuntu, it will be finished in 2 hours or less
2007-10-28T22:45:00.000Z	Konam	pga	and make a fresh install
2007-10-28T22:45:00.000Z	pga	Konam	Nah, the DVD version would take 2+ hours.
2007-10-28T22:45:00.000Z	Konam	pga	then why you don't download the .iso that fits you best?
2007-10-28T22:49:00.000Z	pga	Konam	I'll just wait for 8.04 ..
2007-10-28T22:49:00.000Z	Konam	pga	ok, whatever
2007-10-28T22:49:00.000Z	pga	Konam	yup, whatever.
