2006-09-19T05:12:00.000Z	fatbrain		How do I manuall install .deb files?
2006-09-19T05:12:00.000Z	fatbrain		!deb
2006-09-19T05:12:00.000Z	fatbrain		heh
2006-09-19T05:12:00.000Z	fatbrain		silly me
2006-09-19T05:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	fatbrain	sudo dpkg -i foo.deb
2006-09-19T08:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	fatbrain	file a bug on it? ;-)
2006-09-19T08:05:00.000Z	fatbrain	eyequeue	tried to :P
2006-09-19T08:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	fatbrain	i was jking, but i do know you can file one on the web, or via email too i believe  watch ubotu
2006-09-19T08:06:00.000Z	fatbrain	eyequeue	I know, but still, a bug app that relies on some lib that's broken, sucks
2006-09-19T08:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	fatbrain	yeah, the strange irony makes me smile, but it definitely isn't good for it to remain that way at all
2006-09-19T08:07:00.000Z	eyequeue	fatbrain	the day before you do, may i make a suggestion?
2006-09-19T08:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	fatbrain	df -h, to see your own usage patterns, then you can partition as you may like, at least a /home so reinstalls are more painless, heh
2006-09-19T08:09:00.000Z	fatbrain	eyequeue	will do.
2006-09-19T08:13:00.000Z	eyequeue	fatbrain	you want to low-lever format it?  or make a filesystem on it?  mkfs is probably what you want
2006-09-19T08:13:00.000Z	fatbrain	eyequeue	thanks
2006-09-19T08:13:00.000Z	eyequeue	fatbrain	mkfs.(and then press tab, you'll see a lot of choices for fs heh)
2006-09-19T13:29:00.000Z	eyequeue	fatbrain	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2006-09-19T13:30:00.000Z	fatbrain	eyequeue	ah, already installed it
2006-09-25T05:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	fatbrain	enable multiverse, then sudo apt-get install unrar
2006-09-25T05:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	fatbrain	needs sudo
2006-09-25T05:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	fatbrain	nothing ever needs sudo su
2006-09-25T05:06:00.000Z	fatbrain	eyequeue	needs?
