2010-07-15T14:46:00.000Z	MetalGeek_N00b		If not couls someone suggest a resource ans i cant find anything
2010-07-15T14:47:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	MetalGeek_N00b	Um...what is the question?
2010-07-15T14:48:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	MetalGeek_N00b	Um...did you make sure that you've got all the theme engines installed? You can open Synaptic Package Manager and type "theme-engine" in the search field, then just pick all the theme engines listed, install them, then try again...
2010-07-15T14:49:00.000Z	MetalGeek_N00b	YankDownUnder	Thanks mate will go try now
2010-07-15T14:51:00.000Z	MetalGeek_N00b	YankDownUnder	ok, confused myself already Synaptic Package Manager? sorfware center, or synaptic repository
2010-07-15T14:52:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	MetalGeek_N00b	System => Administration => Synaptic Package Manager
2010-07-15T14:54:00.000Z	MetalGeek_N00b	YankDownUnder	Cool, doing it now, didnt even know that was there
2010-07-15T14:54:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	MetalGeek_N00b	Coolbeans...now you do - HOWEVER, bear in mind that sometimes folks try to use theme packages that are either outdated, or just not properly put together...
2010-07-15T14:57:00.000Z	MetalGeek_N00b	YankDownUnder	so you think i should download the hole list that i get from searching theme-engine
2010-07-15T14:58:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	MetalGeek_N00b	The ones you probably want are aurora, murrine and that's about it, really...that should do the trick - however, if you're going to muck around with your themes, get 'em all.
2010-07-15T15:03:00.000Z	MetalGeek_N00b	YankDownUnder	Is there no way to tell what my theme needs as to download all is over 500 mb
2010-07-15T15:03:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	MetalGeek_N00b	Um...did you just pick the engines, or did you pick like everything mate?
2010-07-15T15:04:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	MetalGeek_N00b	Um...mate...just pick the bits that say "theme-engine" - not all the rest...all you want is the engine for the themes...
2010-07-15T15:07:00.000Z	MetalGeek_N00b	YankDownUnder	thats better thanks 11mb
2010-07-15T15:07:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	MetalGeek_N00b	11 is more than 10
2010-07-15T15:08:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	MetalGeek_N00b	It's a reference to "This is Spinal Tap" - never mind.
2010-07-15T15:10:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	MetalGeek_N00b	Good on ya - been there done that twice already...so my skin's a bit tougher on that note... :)
2010-07-15T15:12:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	MetalGeek_N00b	Blessings mate
2010-07-15T15:15:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	MetalGeek_N00b	Can't say's I've seen that theme on gnome-look.org before....
2010-07-15T15:40:00.000Z	MetalGeek_N00b	YankDownUnder	Have you got a second?
