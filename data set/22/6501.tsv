2007-10-24T01:33:00.000Z	musashi		how can i fix an error that says "Can't create test file /var/lib/mysql/host.lower-test; mysqld does not have access rights to directory"
2007-10-24T01:34:00.000Z	preaction	musashi	give access rights to that directory? usually by changing the owner of that director to the user mysql is running as (usually "mysql")
2007-10-24T01:35:00.000Z	musashi	preaction	what is the exact command, i think i messed up my stuff enough. is it sudo chown -R mysql /var/lib/mysql
2007-10-24T01:36:00.000Z	preaction	musashi	sounds right. try it
2007-10-24T01:38:00.000Z	preaction	musashi	what's changed since yesterday?
2007-10-24T01:38:00.000Z	musashi	preaction	installed lighttpd and php
2007-10-24T01:38:00.000Z	musashi	preaction	which both work fine
2007-10-24T01:39:00.000Z	preaction	musashi	the error you just got means that mysql is not running
2007-10-24T01:39:00.000Z	musashi	preaction	but what could have caused that? i didnt change anything about the mysql stuff yesterday
2007-10-24T01:40:00.000Z	preaction	musashi	i dont know
2007-10-24T01:41:00.000Z	musashi	preaction	i need the databases that are in mysql, if i reinstall will it kill them?
2007-10-24T01:41:00.000Z	preaction	musashi	don't reinstall, start it again
2007-10-24T01:41:00.000Z	musashi	preaction	dunno how ;_;
2007-10-24T01:41:00.000Z	preaction	musashi	sudo invoke-rc.d mysql start
2007-10-24T01:43:00.000Z	musashi	preaction	it just failed.
2007-10-24T01:43:00.000Z	preaction	musashi	so check the error log
2007-10-24T01:43:00.000Z	musashi	preaction	im noob ;_; where is that at
2007-10-24T01:44:00.000Z	preaction	musashi	probably /var/log/ <- somewhere, i don't know either. maybe #mysql knows more
2007-10-24T01:44:00.000Z	musashi	preaction	its empty... theres a #mysql?
2007-10-24T01:45:00.000Z	preaction	musashi	your entire /var/log directory is empty? i find that difficult to believe. yes, there's a #mysql. use /list to get a list of channels on freenode
2007-10-24T01:48:00.000Z	musashi	preaction	i meant the mysql.log was empty
2007-10-24T02:00:00.000Z	musashi	preaction	i take it thats bad D:
