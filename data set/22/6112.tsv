2006-12-23T16:27:00.000Z	un_operateur	glyn	in most cases its safe to replace every edgy with hoary
2006-12-23T16:31:00.000Z	un_operateur	glyn	just replace every instance of the work edgy with hoary
2006-12-23T16:34:00.000Z	un_operateur	glyn	you need to update apt first -- run this -- sudo aptitude update
2006-12-23T16:35:00.000Z	un_operateur	glyn	it means you have two enries in sources.list pointing to the same location
2006-12-23T16:36:00.000Z	un_operateur	glyn	hold up
2006-12-23T16:37:00.000Z	un_operateur	glyn	-- this is exactly what your sources.list should look like -- http://pastebin.ca/289687
2006-12-23T16:39:00.000Z	un_operateur	glyn	numbers??
2006-12-23T16:40:00.000Z	un_operateur	glyn	you mean the line numbers on the left?? no no, they shouldnt be included
2006-12-23T16:41:00.000Z	un_operateur	glyn	did you update apt afterwards?
2006-12-23T16:42:00.000Z	un_operateur	glyn	I just searched http://packages.ubuntu.com for gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg -- it seems it is not included on hoary
2006-12-23T16:43:00.000Z	un_operateur	glyn	one sec
2006-12-23T16:45:00.000Z	un_operateur	glyn	here http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/g/gst-ffmpeg/gstreamer0.8-ffmpeg_0.8.7-7ubuntu1_i386.deb
