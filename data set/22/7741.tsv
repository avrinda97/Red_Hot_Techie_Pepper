2006-01-07T11:44:00.000Z	Marc_D		Does anyone here know how to bypass the "Could not execute the external program msiexec.exe"  when installing Counter Strike Source?
2006-01-07T11:44:00.000Z	Marc_D		I'm trying to do that, lol! :(
2006-01-07T11:45:00.000Z	Marc_D		Yes
2006-01-07T11:45:00.000Z	Marc_D		I have Cedega though. :(
2006-01-07T11:46:00.000Z	Marc_D		And it says clearly on the cedega forums that it's suported
2006-01-07T11:47:00.000Z	Marc_D		Doh :(
2006-01-07T11:47:00.000Z	Marc_D		lol, thanks for the help Tim
2006-01-07T11:48:00.000Z	Marc_D		Jrex linux, do you have YAhoo/Msn/AIM?
2006-01-07T11:49:00.000Z	Marc_D		Yea, Jrex, what do you need linux for?
2006-01-07T11:49:00.000Z	Marc_D		Just have someone do it for you if that's all you need.
2006-01-07T11:50:00.000Z	Coag	Marc_D	what a horrible thing to say
2006-01-07T11:50:00.000Z	Marc_D	Coag	I'm sorry - But Im' being honest. If he doesnt plan to use it on a regular basis he really dosent need to know the ins and outs of linux
2006-01-07T11:51:00.000Z	Coag	Marc_D	life is composed of the experiences within, it's possible to just have someone else do things for you for everything, but then what do you learn?
2006-01-07T11:53:00.000Z	Marc_D	Coag	I guess you've got a point.  I'll resign to say that If I was in his position, I wouldnt learn it just for a server that I'd only interface with for certian things - But I'm not, I'm in tech suport and taking a ton of Techie classes so I need linux (And linux is just more fun)
2006-01-07T11:53:00.000Z	Coag	Marc_D	I agree linux is just more fun :)
2006-01-07T11:54:00.000Z	Marc_D	Coag	<3 the agreements in the middle of disagreements (you see what I did there, <3 is a heart :P )
2006-01-07T11:54:00.000Z	Coag	Marc_D	:P
2006-01-07T11:55:00.000Z	Marc_D	Coag	no chance you play Counterstrike Source, is there? I need someone to walk me through the install
2006-01-07T11:56:00.000Z	Marc_D	Coag	can we speak in a private room, it's hard to read here.
2006-01-07T11:56:00.000Z	Coag	Marc_D	sure thing
2006-01-07T11:59:00.000Z	Marc_D	Coag	can you see the dialoug window?
