2011-08-14T10:06:00.000Z	marezz		Hi everyone, I got a problem with watching videos, screen is black but I can hear the audio, I can only see parts of the video when I open dropdown menu in the player, when I open new window over the player I can see the video like on this screen shot http://imagebin.org/167757 This happens with every player, anyone knows how to fix this?
2011-08-14T10:06:00.000Z	ldr	marezz	could be realted to some compositing stuff of your window manager, which one are you using unity?
2011-08-14T10:06:00.000Z	marezz	ldr	I use ubuntu classic
2011-08-14T10:06:00.000Z	marezz	ldr	without effects
2011-08-14T10:07:00.000Z	ldr	marezz	hmm maybe try diffrent outputs with mplayers -vo option to see if its happens with everyone
2011-08-14T10:10:00.000Z	ldr	marezz	i would still recommend trying diffrent video outputs maybe you find one which works
2011-08-14T10:10:00.000Z	marezz	ldr	Which one should I try?
2011-08-14T10:11:00.000Z	ldr	marezz	xvidix,xv,opengl,sdl to start with all of the x ones if you have no luck
2011-08-14T10:16:00.000Z	marezz	ldr	Still not working
2011-08-14T10:17:00.000Z	ldr	marezz	you tried all of them?
2011-08-14T10:17:00.000Z	marezz	ldr	 Yes
2011-08-14T10:18:00.000Z	marezz	ldr	Note that I watched videos earlier today, not sure whats wrong...
2011-08-14T10:18:00.000Z	ldr	marezz	which player did you use? mplayer? maybe mplayers console output can give you some hint
2011-08-14T10:18:00.000Z	marezz	ldr	smplayer
2011-08-14T10:19:00.000Z	ldr	marezz	try running mplayer from the console and see what the output tells you maybe you find something useful
2011-08-14T10:19:00.000Z	marezz	ldr	 How do I do that?
2011-08-14T10:20:00.000Z	ldr	marezz	open terminal and type mplayer <videofile>
2011-08-14T10:20:00.000Z	ldr	marezz	you need to replace <videofile> with the filename and location of the videpo you want to play of course
2011-08-14T10:23:00.000Z	marezz	ldr	Ok I did it
2011-08-14T10:24:00.000Z	ldr	marezz	why not? maybe you need to close the player beforehand
2011-08-14T10:24:00.000Z	marezz	ldr	u was right :)
2011-08-14T10:25:00.000Z	marezz	ldr	Here it is http://pastebin.com/1DS6i51k
