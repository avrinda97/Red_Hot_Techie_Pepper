2007-07-08T16:27:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula		mount: unknown filesystem type 'LVM2_member' -- I have a nearly hosed hard drive that I have connected via USB adapter...can anyone help me possibly bypass this error?
2007-07-08T16:29:00.000Z	Cappy	Oni-Dracula	sounds like the filesystem type isn't being recongnised - is there data already on the disk?
2007-07-08T16:29:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Cappy	it was an ubuntu install that a couple weeks ago decided to stop booting (hard drive going bad?)
2007-07-08T16:30:00.000Z	Cappy	Oni-Dracula	do you get any output in your syslog?
2007-07-08T16:30:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Cappy	you mean from the install that's on the USB hard drive that can't be mounted? No, grub wasn't able to load a partition
2007-07-08T16:31:00.000Z	Cappy	Oni-Dracula	its sound to me that the ubuntu installer has installed onto aLVM group which it now can't find cause of the new instalation
2007-07-08T16:31:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Cappy	any way to bypass so I can access the /home directory?
2007-07-08T16:32:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Cappy	or is it completely hosed and has to be formatted
2007-07-08T16:32:00.000Z	Cappy	Oni-Dracula	I'm not sure never had to get past that problem before Anyone else had to do this?

2007-07-08T05:01:00.000Z	Cappy	Oni-Dracula	could also be LVM if you selected that at install time
2007-07-08T05:02:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Cappy	Shadow6363, syslog sez [ 6853.494831]  EXT3-fs: Magic mismatch, very weird !
2007-07-08T05:03:00.000Z	Cappy	Oni-Dracula	in a termial what does sudo cfdisk /dev/sdb show?
2007-07-08T05:03:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Cappy	it says it's time to cry... because it shouldn't say NTFS like it does
2007-07-08T05:05:00.000Z	Cappy	Oni-Dracula	arse :(
2007-07-08T05:05:00.000Z	Cappy	Oni-Dracula	sure its the right disk?
2007-07-08T05:05:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Cappy	well it's the only other disk attached to this thing besides the drive I boot to (which is 'buntu)
2007-07-08T05:06:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Cappy	I wonder if the darksun package might have something for this situation
2007-07-08T05:06:00.000Z	Cappy	Oni-Dracula	the darksun?
2007-07-08T05:07:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Cappy	a package known as Darksun that contains stuff like ntfsundelete
2007-07-08T05:08:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Cappy	it's not in any repos though it seems :-/ gotta boot to SLAX to use it
2007-07-08T05:08:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	Cappy	thanks for the help :)
