2008-02-26T20:31:00.000Z	AJC_Z0		I'm just about to do so. Anything you'd like to warn me/us about?
2008-02-26T20:32:00.000Z	DB42	AJC_Z0	well my system borked in the middle
2008-02-26T20:34:00.000Z	DB42	AJC_Z0	it tells me there is a newline miossing in teh language-pack-en-base list file, and doesn't continue/install
2008-02-26T20:35:00.000Z	AJC_Z0	DB42	Was any other process affected that you noticed?
2008-02-26T20:36:00.000Z	DB42	AJC_Z0	nop, but it should very well be because my comp borked in the middle of the upgrade
2008-02-26T20:38:00.000Z	DB42	AJC_Z0	again, if you can send me the list file before updating...
2008-02-26T20:38:00.000Z	AJC_Z0	DB42	Borkage comes in many varieties. Did your system crash and catch fire, carry on unaffected except for the error from the update, or something in between?
2008-02-26T20:38:00.000Z	AJC_Z0	DB42	What list file?
2008-02-26T20:39:00.000Z	DB42	AJC_Z0	i did an upgrade, the machine shutdown not safely, thats it
2008-02-26T20:40:00.000Z	AJC_Z0	DB42	It shut down because it crashed? Because you told it to? Because...?
2008-02-26T20:40:00.000Z	DB42	AJC_Z0	i wish i knew.. again, it stoped working, not shutdown (it's a laptop)
2008-02-26T20:41:00.000Z	AJC_Z0	DB42	I'm not trying to give you a hard time, but it would help at least one person (me) if you could say in technical terms what happened when you applied the update
2008-02-26T20:41:00.000Z	DB42	AJC_Z0	the computer turned off
2008-02-26T20:42:00.000Z	AJC_Z0	DB42	I'm inclined to agree that a language pack update is very unlikely to have that effect, no matter how broken
2008-02-26T20:43:00.000Z	DB42	AJC_Z0	this is why i want the dpkg files from somebody before updating, so i can see if it fixes my probelm..
2008-02-26T20:44:00.000Z	AJC_Z0	DB42	I just applied the updates (the base and other) with no problems. I tried to copy the detailed output bu the window closed before I could copy it
2008-02-26T20:45:00.000Z	DB42	AJC_Z0	now i dont need any files
2008-02-26T20:45:00.000Z	AJC_Z0	DB42	So you need a time machine
2008-02-26T20:46:00.000Z	DB42	AJC_Z0	nah... just a bit of listening before doing
2008-02-26T21:14:00.000Z	AJC_Z0	DB42	There's something dodgy about that .deb. Just see the filename - language-pack-en-base_1%3a7.10+20080205_all
2008-02-26T21:16:00.000Z	DB42	AJC_Z0	so what to do ?
2008-02-26T21:17:00.000Z	AJC_Z0	DB42	I don't know. Unfortunately I have yet to enjoy the experience of unbreaking a patch on Ubuntu
