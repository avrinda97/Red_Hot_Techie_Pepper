2007-02-26T13:20:00.000Z	ray_		hey, I'm having some trouble connecting to my windows computer. Can anyone help?
2007-02-26T13:22:00.000Z	ray_		I can't connect to my windows computer on any level, RDP,  PING... nothing
2007-02-26T13:22:00.000Z	ray_		the windows machine is up and online
2007-02-26T13:23:00.000Z	ray_		lol, gj
2007-02-26T13:23:00.000Z	ray_		anyone have any ideas why I can't even ping the windows machine?
2007-02-26T13:24:00.000Z	ray_		jeez, I can't even connect to my router
2007-02-26T13:24:00.000Z	ray_		no route to host
2007-02-26T13:25:00.000Z	ray_		how am I even online if that's the case?
2007-02-26T13:26:00.000Z	IcemanV9	ray_	it would be better if you can check to see if win32 box is connected to network (ipconfig in cmd)
2007-02-26T13:26:00.000Z	ray_	IcemanV9	it's on the network
2007-02-26T13:27:00.000Z	IcemanV9	ray_	can win32 ping your ubuntu box?
2007-02-26T13:28:00.000Z	IcemanV9	ray_	hm. okay. router is doing something with local networking.
2007-02-26T13:29:00.000Z	IcemanV9	ray_	if you cannot access the router, then it might be a good idea to reset it. (i have done it before)
2007-02-26T13:32:00.000Z	IcemanV9	ray_	can you access the router by wired, not wireless?
2007-02-26T13:32:00.000Z	IcemanV9	ray_	good idea, dude :)
2007-02-26T13:34:00.000Z	IcemanV9	ray_	good. check out all options and see if all boxes can talk to each other.
2007-02-26T13:35:00.000Z	IcemanV9	ray_	well. it could be anything. you'll have to play with it 'til all machines can talk to each other.
2007-02-26T13:35:00.000Z	ray_	IcemanV9	I don't even know where to start
2007-02-26T13:37:00.000Z	IcemanV9	ray_	can you ping win32 box now?
2007-02-26T13:37:00.000Z	IcemanV9	ray_	ah! then try RDP
2007-02-26T13:38:00.000Z	IcemanV9	ray_	ok. you'll need to find out why on the router. linksys or d-link?
2007-02-26T13:39:00.000Z	IcemanV9	ray_	i could do it on wireless with linksys. i didn't do anything special on the router. why don't you check the security page | wireless tab
