2007-12-13T14:49:00.000Z	kousotu		and hence I have th ever-annoying "tri-boot on grub" issue
2007-12-13T14:50:00.000Z	kousotu		I need to complie a program that doesn't have a "makefile" how would I do so
2007-12-13T14:51:00.000Z	kousotu		but I'm working on booting it seperatly
2007-12-13T14:51:00.000Z	gonzoism	kousotu	does it have autoconf or automake stuff for making it ?  is it perl stuff ?   is there a readme or install or similiar ?
2007-12-13T14:51:00.000Z	kousotu	gonzoism	the app? lemme check
2007-12-13T14:52:00.000Z	kousotu	gonzoism	nope
2007-12-13T14:52:00.000Z	gonzoism	kousotu	hmm...  small program ?   few files ?   maybe just run gcc on it.
2007-12-13T14:53:00.000Z	kousotu	gonzoism	it's secondlife
2007-12-13T14:53:00.000Z	gonzoism	kousotu	gcc -i whatever.c++  -o whatever_you_want_bin_name_to_be
2007-12-13T14:54:00.000Z	gonzoism	kousotu	oh.  there should be build instructions somewhere, or a linux folder, or a howto on a the net or something.  check for a docs or Documentation folder too.  maybe builds folder will have a linux script
2007-12-13T14:55:00.000Z	kousotu	gonzoism	hm.. seems to already be compiled, according to Lindinlabs
2007-12-13T14:56:00.000Z	gonzoism	kousotu	is there a bin/ directory ?
2007-12-13T14:56:00.000Z	kousotu	gonzoism	Pirate_Hunter: I use NTFS mounting on linux
2007-12-13T14:57:00.000Z	kousotu	gonzoism	yes
2007-12-13T14:57:00.000Z	gonzoism	kousotu	^
2007-12-13T15:00:00.000Z	kousotu	gonzoism	question...
2007-12-13T15:02:00.000Z	gonzoism	kousotu	dunno...   you can run the command, file bin/filename on it and see what kind of file it is.
