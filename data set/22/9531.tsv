2004-10-17T07:33:00.000Z	socomm		Yes Y! games are all Java if I'm not mistaken.

2004-10-17T07:36:00.000Z	socomm		Remember you did not set your root password when you installed.
2004-10-17T07:36:00.000Z	socomm		You can set you're password by rebooting pressing ESC and going into safe mode.
2004-10-17T07:37:00.000Z	socomm		Then type passwd and set your root passwd.
2004-10-17T07:37:00.000Z	socomm		after that ctl^D shoot boot you back in.

2005-08-09T06:08:00.000Z	socomm	HrdwrBoB	Mind your business.
