2004-10-01T12:48:00.000Z	linux_mafia	wido	usb-bt is perfect on my box
2004-10-01T12:49:00.000Z	linux_mafia	wido	what exactly are you trying to do with bt?
2004-10-01T12:50:00.000Z	wido	linux_mafia	i'm trying to upload files from my mobile to the pc and back
2004-10-01T12:50:00.000Z	linux_mafia	wido	did you add jdubs bt repo?
2004-10-01T12:50:00.000Z	wido	linux_mafia	i had it working with gentoo and it looks as if all needed modules are loaded by ubuntu
2004-10-01T12:51:00.000Z	wido	linux_mafia	nope. were is it located?
2004-10-01T12:52:00.000Z	linux_mafia	wido	deb http://people.no-name-yet.com/~jdub/warty ./
2004-10-01T12:52:00.000Z	linux_mafia	wido	apt-get install gnome-bluetooth
2004-10-01T13:07:00.000Z	linux_mafia	wido	all good ma?
2004-10-01T13:08:00.000Z	wido	linux_mafia	nope. the bluetooth device is still not detected :(
2004-10-01T13:09:00.000Z	linux_mafia	wido	you got bluez-utils?
2004-10-01T13:11:00.000Z	wido	linux_mafia	argh. suddenly it is detected. like magic ;) i did nothing then a 'hcitool scan' and there it was. strange. i really did nothing. i can send you my bash history to prove it ;)
2004-10-01T13:12:00.000Z	linux_mafia	wido	sweet, get gnome-phone-manager, that rules
2004-10-01T13:14:00.000Z	wido	linux_mafia	ok, i'll try it
2004-10-01T13:52:00.000Z	wido	linux_mafia	the phone manager is quite cool. but it would be bercool to call via bluetooth :)
2004-10-01T13:53:00.000Z	linux_mafia	wido	yeah, or if it could somehow match the numbers to names in your address book, so it had caller id, but still, i like it
2004-10-01T14:07:00.000Z	wido	linux_mafia	i wanted to get started with mono after my exams. maybe i'll do some hacking to integrate the evolution addressbook into gnome phone manager :)
2004-10-01T14:07:00.000Z	linux_mafia	wido	you would be the man
2004-10-01T14:08:00.000Z	linux_mafia	wido	perhaps you could use some of the address book lookup applet code?
2004-10-01T14:09:00.000Z	wido	linux_mafia	yes, that would be ideal. but first i have to get used to mono/gtk. until now i've only done python/qt development
2004-10-05T15:31:00.000Z	linux_mafia	wido	hows our bt address app coming ;)
2004-10-05T05:21:00.000Z	wido	linux_mafia	moin. unfortunately i haven't done anything yet. i'm currently busy with my math exams and my primary project
