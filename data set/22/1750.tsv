2010-01-22T09:08:00.000Z	Nichod		Well anyone knowledgeable know why Ubuntu 9.04 would install fine, but 9.10 wouldn't?
2010-01-22T09:08:00.000Z	Nichod		Everytime I downloaded a 9.10 image it had an error in one file. And would cut off mid-installation.
2010-01-22T09:09:00.000Z	loops	Nichod	different kernels, probably a regression.   What hardware are you on, and what do you mean by "doesn't install" ?
2010-01-22T09:09:00.000Z	Nichod	loops	it would simple say that an error occurred during installation (check harddrive, makesure CD fine, etc.)
2010-01-22T09:11:00.000Z	loops	Nichod	you might want to try installing from a USB thumb drive instead of CD
2010-01-22T09:12:00.000Z	Nichod	loops	i tried installing with wubi, used unetbootin to create a usb burn, downloaded direct from ubuntu.com and downloaded a torrent.
2010-01-22T09:13:00.000Z	loops	Nichod	when you say "error in one file", were you getting an error message?
2010-01-22T09:13:00.000Z	loops	Nichod	something isn't adding up.
2010-01-22T09:13:00.000Z	Nichod	loops	the error in 1 file was when scanning the disc for errors
2010-01-22T09:14:00.000Z	Nichod	loops	using the built in scan tool on the disc
2010-01-22T09:14:00.000Z	loops	Nichod	which disk, the USB thumb drive?
2010-01-22T09:15:00.000Z	Nichod	loops	i technically tried installing 5 times. two of them using a CD and both times i checked the CD it said it had a file with an error. and it was from two different download locations that had sums checked
2010-01-22T09:16:00.000Z	loops	Nichod	sometimes the disk-check does mess up.   But lets ignore that for a second, what happened when you installed from USB thumb drive?
2010-01-22T09:16:00.000Z	Nichod	loops	it wouldn't even read from the USB drive.
2010-01-22T09:16:00.000Z	Nichod	loops	9.04 ran from same usb drive fine.
2010-01-22T09:17:00.000Z	loops	Nichod	my guess is you're having more than one problem.
2010-01-22T09:18:00.000Z	loops	Nichod	i would ignore the disk-check and proceed with install, if it gives you an error, work from there
2010-01-22T09:18:00.000Z	Nichod	loops	probably. just happy 9.04 is installed. just wondering if any known issues with 9.10 and hardware exist. any significant ones. i did do a search and came across other people that did the disk check and came up with the same error in a single file that had the same problem, but no one game a response to their problem on the forums.
2010-01-22T09:21:00.000Z	Nichod	loops	how about any issues with scsi drives and karmic?
2010-01-22T09:21:00.000Z	loops	Nichod	yes someone earlier complained of issue installing with SCSI cdrom, and had to go to USB
2010-01-22T09:22:00.000Z	Nichod	loops	well it's a scsi hd
2010-01-22T09:22:00.000Z	loops	Nichod	could be a problem of course, it's a new kernel, there might be a regression
