2009-03-11T00:03:00.000Z	Viata	coreyman	Ok.  So in the menu bar at the top, when you select "connect to server," and type the machine name of the server followed by the folder, what happens?  (in this format: \\machine-name\folder-name)

2009-03-11T00:08:00.000Z	Viata	coreyman	in the menu, when you click on "network" underneath the different home folders (on the non server), do you see any other machines in your network workgroup, including the one you want to connect to?

2009-03-11T00:13:00.000Z	Viata	coreyman	I'm not sure, to be honest.  I haven't networked windows to Ubuntu machines and vica versa before.  I'm sorry.
