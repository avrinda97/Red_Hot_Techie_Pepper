2011-01-01T16:04:00.000Z	amfamf		I downloaded and installed ubuntu now and it's my first time using this os... I had a great time with my first day and it seems that I'm getting it. I can't find the programming language support though? any idea on this?
2011-01-01T16:04:00.000Z	amfamf		c++,java
2011-01-01T16:05:00.000Z	amfamf		ok
2011-01-01T16:05:00.000Z	amfamf		i thought you have to go to -sudo or something
2011-01-01T16:05:00.000Z	Gimbli	amfamf	For Java I would recommend eclipse. If you want to program in C++ I would choose the Qt Creator as an IDE
2011-01-01T16:05:00.000Z	amfamf		so i have to go to the package manager
2011-01-01T16:06:00.000Z	amfamf		so which is much better install the ide's packed with the compilers?
2011-01-01T16:06:00.000Z	amfamf		like codeblocks and eclipse?
2011-01-01T16:06:00.000Z	amfamf		or install it via package manager
2011-01-01T16:07:00.000Z	Gimbli	amfamf	depends on your needs I guess. if you do not have any special recommendations you can install them via package manager
2011-01-01T16:07:00.000Z	Gimbli	amfamf	s/recommendations/requirements/ ;)
2011-01-01T16:08:00.000Z	amfamf	Gimbli	is that a directory which i can access through the terminal?
2011-01-01T16:09:00.000Z	amfamf		I am so noob
2011-01-01T16:09:00.000Z	Gimbli	amfamf	what kind of directory do you mean? if you mean the package manager I would recommend the "GUI" way via synaptic
2011-01-01T16:09:00.000Z	amfamf		hahahha not that
2011-01-01T16:09:00.000Z	amfamf		the s/recommendations/requirements u say
2011-01-01T16:09:00.000Z	amfamf		sori man
2011-01-01T16:09:00.000Z	Gimbli	amfamf	no problem ;)
2011-01-01T16:10:00.000Z	Gimbli	amfamf	sorry, gotta be off now. perhaps someone else can guide you to install the IDEs you want :)
2011-01-01T16:10:00.000Z	amfamf		guess i have to study more on linux commands and the architecture of it... I totally love this ubuntu
2011-01-01T16:11:00.000Z	amfamf	Gimbli	I'll just google it...
2011-01-01T16:11:00.000Z	Gimbli	amfamf	ah, it should not be that difficult. everything you need can be found in the repositories, I guess
