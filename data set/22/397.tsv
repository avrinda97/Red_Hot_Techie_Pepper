2011-10-28T12:36:00.000Z	s0nee	soreau	is there any way to enable line in playback in ubuntu ?
2011-10-28T12:37:00.000Z	soreau	s0nee	What do you mean?
2011-10-28T12:38:00.000Z	soreau	s0nee	sure
2011-10-28T12:38:00.000Z	soreau	s0nee	Have you tried alsamixer? (arrow keys to navigate, 'm' to (un)mute channels)
2011-10-28T12:39:00.000Z	s0nee	soreau	ok i'll try it
2011-10-28T12:48:00.000Z	s0nee	soreau	i tried different options but still no sound. any ideas ?
2011-10-28T12:48:00.000Z	soreau	s0nee	Well if you don't have a pre-amp (like an effects pedal) then you might need to plug it into the microphone jack
2011-10-28T12:49:00.000Z	soreau	s0nee	line-in is typically unamplified
2011-10-28T12:49:00.000Z	s0nee	soreau	im routing from an amp
2011-10-28T12:50:00.000Z	soreau	s0nee	The other obvious issue is making sure the connections are physically and electrically sound
2011-10-28T12:51:00.000Z	soreau	s0nee	Also make sure you're selecting the right audio device in alsamixer with F6
2011-10-28T12:52:00.000Z	s0nee	soreau	im pretty sure that line in and out are fine. also im using the correct sound card (f6)
2011-10-28T12:53:00.000Z	soreau	s0nee	It should work then. Do any of the other input jacks work? mic?
2011-10-28T12:53:00.000Z	s0nee	soreau	any other options ? i tried jack before but it had too much noise
2011-10-28T12:54:00.000Z	s0nee	soreau	i tried both front and rear
2011-10-28T12:55:00.000Z	soreau	s0nee	It largely depends on your audio hardware and where the hardware lives in your machine. For example, having a PCI audio card too close to the video card or other hardware could have crosstalk/noise
2011-10-28T12:55:00.000Z	soreau	s0nee	If it's an on-board audio chip, there's not a whole lot you can do to move it obviously
2011-10-28T12:56:00.000Z	soreau	s0nee	Ideally, you'd have a decent PCI card installed in the furthest PCI slot on the mobo
2011-10-28T12:56:00.000Z	s0nee	soreau	i do know that. it worked on windows with almost no noise so i believe i can get it work on ubuntu
2011-10-28T12:57:00.000Z	soreau	s0nee	Another factor could be pulseaudio
2011-10-28T13:02:00.000Z	s0nee	soreau	thanks though
2011-10-28T13:03:00.000Z	soreau	s0nee	jack seems to offer the most control for me but line-in should work
