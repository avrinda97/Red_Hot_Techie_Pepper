2005-03-18T12:21:00.000Z	helloyo	ells	i'm new to ubuntu, but i have used dvdrip a lot
2005-03-18T12:21:00.000Z	ells	helloyo	cool
2005-03-18T12:22:00.000Z	helloyo	ells	not 100% sure, but i can point you in the right direction
2005-03-18T12:22:00.000Z	ells	helloyo	okay, how can I make a dvd to watch on my home player using the vobs
2005-03-18T12:22:00.000Z	helloyo	ells	dvds are encrypted with css, so you need that library, but with dvdrip you should already have it. the problem with dvdrip is that it rips titles, not the whole dvd. might be best to copy the whole dvd, and burn that exactly, not sure how this works though sorry
2005-03-18T12:22:00.000Z	ells	helloyo	I ripped it
2005-03-18T12:23:00.000Z	helloyo	ells	a lot of dvd players can play vobs if thats how you want to watch it
2005-03-18T12:23:00.000Z	ells	helloyo	okay, how can I compile it
2005-03-18T12:23:00.000Z	ells	helloyo	i tried just copying the vobs, that did not work
2005-03-18T12:24:00.000Z	helloyo		ells? compile? no need to do that
2005-03-18T12:24:00.000Z	helloyo		can you view the vobs with any media players?
2005-03-18T12:24:00.000Z	ells	helloyo	when i copied the vobs, that did not work
2005-03-18T12:24:00.000Z	ells		I can watch them
2005-03-18T12:24:00.000Z	helloyo	ells	have you tried burning them to dvd and trying that on your player?
2005-03-18T12:25:00.000Z	helloyo		dodgy, but it might work
2005-03-18T12:25:00.000Z	ells	helloyo	yeap
