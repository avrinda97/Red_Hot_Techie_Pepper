2007-04-21T15:55:00.000Z	foug		is there a way to "dump" my memory?
2007-04-21T15:56:00.000Z	randomwalker	foug	sudo cp /dev/mem filename
2007-04-21T15:56:00.000Z	foug	randomwalker	file name? when i mean by dump is clear all my cached memory
2007-04-21T15:57:00.000Z	randomwalker	foug	i have no idea how to do that
2007-04-21T15:57:00.000Z	foug	randomwalker	darn
2007-04-21T15:58:00.000Z	randomwalker	foug	try googling for linux clear file cache or something like that
2007-04-21T15:59:00.000Z	foug	randomwalker	is it bad that all my memory is cached? all the time
2007-04-21T15:59:00.000Z	randomwalker	foug	no, if you needed memory for programs it would automatically clear the cache
2007-04-22T16:05:00.000Z	randomwalker	foug	right click on trash folder, empty trash
2007-04-22T16:05:00.000Z	foug	randomwalker	terminal command
2007-04-22T16:06:00.000Z	randomwalker	foug	in the command line, go to the trash folder and "rm *"
2007-04-22T16:06:00.000Z	randomwalker	foug	be careful, that's dangerous
2007-04-22T16:06:00.000Z	foug	randomwalker	cool thanks
2007-04-22T16:08:00.000Z	randomwalker	foug	in nautulis select "show hidden files"
2007-04-22T16:09:00.000Z	randomwalker	foug	or Ctrl+H
2007-04-22T16:09:00.000Z	foug	randomwalker	ok i see it now, hmm, everything is in my home folder
2007-04-22T16:09:00.000Z	foug	randomwalker	different form windows and kind of annoying, lol
2007-04-22T16:09:00.000Z	randomwalker	foug	once you get used to it it makes a lot more sense
2007-04-22T16:10:00.000Z	randomwalker	foug	that everything is in the same place
2007-04-22T16:10:00.000Z	foug	randomwalker	cool
2007-04-22T16:10:00.000Z	randomwalker	foug	stuff that begins with a dot is hidden by default
