2005-02-22T11:43:00.000Z	tezza		it seems that i have sound modules loaded but i have no sound at all? anyone using the ATI Technologies Inc IXP150 AC'97 Audio Controller for sound?
2005-02-22T11:44:00.000Z	crimsun	tezza	warty?
2005-02-22T11:44:00.000Z	tezza	crimsun	yes
2005-02-22T11:44:00.000Z	crimsun	tezza	you need a newer version of ALSA.
2005-02-22T11:44:00.000Z	tezza	crimsun	what's the best way to go about that?
2005-02-22T11:45:00.000Z	crimsun	tezza	sudo aptitude install build-essential kernel-package linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2005-02-22T11:46:00.000Z	crimsun	tezza	then: wget http://ftp.wa.au.debian.org/debian/pool/main/a/alsa-driver/alsa-source_1.0.8-4_all.deb
2005-02-22T11:46:00.000Z	crimsun	tezza	then: sudo dpkg -i alsa-source_1.0.8-4_all.deb
2005-02-22T11:46:00.000Z	crimsun	tezza	then: sudo dpkg-reconfigure alsa-source
2005-02-22T11:47:00.000Z	crimsun	tezza	then please read the documentation at /usr/share/doc/alsa-source/README.Debian
2005-02-22T11:50:00.000Z	tezza	crimsun	ok cool - after all that is a reboot needed?
2005-02-22T11:50:00.000Z	crimsun	tezza	no, a removal of the current ALSA modules and a reinsertion of the newly-compiled and -installed ALSA modules
2005-02-22T11:51:00.000Z	crimsun	tezza	a reboot will be simpler, but it's not required.
2005-02-22T11:58:00.000Z	tezza	crimsun	i did all that it said within that file but i get a dependency errors
2005-02-22T12:00:00.000Z	crimsun	tezza	which dependency is missing?
2005-02-22T12:00:00.000Z	tezza	crimsun	it's in #flood
2005-02-22T12:05:00.000Z	crimsun	tezza	ok, you'll need more dependencies because alsa-driver has been updated to require additional 1.0.8 versions.
2005-02-22T12:05:00.000Z	crimsun	tezza	/j #alsa
2005-02-24T11:27:00.000Z	tezza	crimsun	you around mate?
2005-02-24T11:27:00.000Z	crimsun	tezza	aye
2005-02-26T14:16:00.000Z	crimsun	tezza	sudo aptitude remowe foo
2005-02-27T13:46:00.000Z	tezza	crimsun	that MARK in /var/log/messages - i can't find anything in man syslog.conf or /etc/syslog.conf about taking that out?
