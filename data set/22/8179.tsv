2005-10-06T16:32:00.000Z	n00bster		i chaecked in Synaptic and sow that it's not installed !!!
2005-10-06T16:33:00.000Z	rob_p	n00bster	 It's not installed by default.  So install it if you need it.
2005-10-06T16:34:00.000Z	n00bster		but i just scannd my ports online , and ther is not a single port open, gottabe Firewall, no ?
2005-10-06T16:35:00.000Z	rob_p	n00bster	 Probably because you are behind a NAT router.
2005-10-06T16:35:00.000Z	n00bster		oh,, yes i em :}
2005-10-06T16:35:00.000Z	rob_p	n00bster	 Then you probably don't want to fool with a local firewall.
2005-10-06T16:36:00.000Z	n00bster		forgot all about this, so whay my frid cannot connect to my desktop? i'm using vnc4server
2005-10-06T16:36:00.000Z	rob_p	n00bster	 You'll have to set up port forwarding on your router for that.
2005-10-06T16:36:00.000Z	n00bster		ectually my router is not blocking eny ports
2005-10-06T16:37:00.000Z	n00bster		hmm... how do i go about doing this (Alcatel STH)
2005-10-06T16:37:00.000Z	n00bster		you know what port vnc4server uses ?
2005-10-06T16:37:00.000Z	rob_p	n00bster	 Can't help you there.  You'll have to read the manual that came with it.
2005-10-06T16:38:00.000Z	n00bster		but with windows eny app that i appruve in the xp firewall, get access !!
2005-10-06T16:39:00.000Z	n00bster		no eny configurations are needed in the router ..
2005-10-06T16:39:00.000Z	rob_p	n00bster	 Then either your router is not doing NAT or else it is already configured to forward inbound connections (like DMZ).
2005-10-06T16:41:00.000Z	n00bster	rob_p	can yuo ping me ?
2005-10-06T16:41:00.000Z	rob_p	n00bster	 In that case, you shouldn't have to mess with the router.  However, you will need to know which local IP address is configured as the DMZ address if that's the case.
