2007-04-02T15:46:00.000Z	Ryugin		Hello. Gparted can't detect my drives. Can someone help?
2007-04-02T15:47:00.000Z	Ryugin		Me?
2007-04-02T15:47:00.000Z	Ryugin		Oh.
2007-04-02T15:48:00.000Z	Ryugin		Hello. Gparted and the Ubuntu installer can't detect my drives. Can someone help?
2007-04-02T15:48:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	new install or rescuing a installation?
2007-04-02T15:49:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	what is currently on your drive?
2007-04-02T15:50:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	what does gparted say when you start it up?
2007-04-02T15:50:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	did you boot up with a live-cd? If yes, which one?
2007-04-02T15:51:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	open a terminal-window and run "cfdisk", what does it say?
2007-04-02T15:54:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	thats okay, do you see any partitions now?
2007-04-02T15:56:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	do you use a tutorial to install ubuntu and vista for dual-boot?
2007-04-02T15:57:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	Try this one http://www.eloff.se/tutorials.php?ubuntu_vista_dualboot
2007-04-02T15:59:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	do you have the CD's to install it afterwards?
2007-04-02T16:00:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	recover CD's only i guess then?
2007-04-03T16:01:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	i understand
2007-04-03T16:01:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	you should be able to burn a recovery-CD from your rescue-partiton. Just don't ask me how. I'm not expert on the details
2007-04-03T16:08:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	I'm bit at a loss here...
2007-04-03T16:10:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	it *could* be that you harddrive controler isn't support by the kernel yet
2007-04-03T16:11:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	maybe try to download a beta-version of ubuntu-feisty-fawn live-cd and try gparted again
2007-04-03T16:13:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	thats pretty common with open-source projekts... people rarly put 1.0 versions out because they still want to polish their babies ;)
2007-04-03T16:14:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	I wish you best luck with the beta... maybe if you manage to get your hands on a more 'dated' computer or maybe in half a year you hardware on your new compaq will be supported (if the beta still doesn't support it now)
2007-04-03T16:15:00.000Z	madmike_	Ryugin	good luck
