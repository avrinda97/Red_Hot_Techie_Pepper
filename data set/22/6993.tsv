2007-05-07T12:26:00.000Z	jrib	johnficca	does it happen if you open a new terminal?
2007-05-07T12:26:00.000Z	jrib	johnficca	from your menu
2007-05-07T12:31:00.000Z	jrib	johnficca	I've seen that problem before, there is a thread on the forums about it.  But I don't remember seeing a definitive answer

2007-05-07T12:36:00.000Z	jrib	johnficca	I do know that if i have an old screen session lying around, I get that same behavior and I believe it is because the DBUS env variables are old and no longer point to the correct DBUS session for my user (I logout and log back in while keeping screen running)
2007-05-07T12:47:00.000Z	jrib	johnficca	try gksudo and gksu and see if there is a difference
2007-05-07T12:48:00.000Z	jrib	johnficca	what is "it"?  both gksu and gksudo?
2007-05-07T12:53:00.000Z	jrib	johnficca	how comfortable are you messing with files on your system??
2007-05-07T12:54:00.000Z	johnficca	jrib	I'm ok with it
2007-05-07T12:54:00.000Z	jrib	johnficca	in /root, get rid of most of the config stuff (just rename .foo to .foo.backup), especially .gnome2 and .gconf
2007-05-07T12:58:00.000Z	johnficca	jrib	rename all of the folder in there
2007-05-07T12:58:00.000Z	jrib	johnficca	try just .gnome2 and .gconf
2007-05-07T12:59:00.000Z	jrib	johnficca	try gksudo gedit again
2007-05-07T12:59:00.000Z	johnficca	jrib	hey I think it works now
2007-05-07T13:00:00.000Z	johnficca	jrib	is that it ?
2007-05-07T13:03:00.000Z	johnficca	jrib	ubuntu remade .gconf and .gnome2 is that ok
2007-05-07T13:06:00.000Z	johnficca	jrib	ok now the problem is back
2007-05-07T13:49:00.000Z	jrib	johnficca	hmm does it go away again if you delete those files again?
