2005-09-16T08:56:00.000Z	Bac9		anyone have experiance with gdm, specifically how to get a user list into it and how to get the userlist to show users?
2005-09-16T08:58:00.000Z	dabaRCo	Bac9	ya, I do. you want a list of possible users, and pictures for their faces instead the question marks?
2005-09-16T08:59:00.000Z	Bac9	dabaRCo	pictures I don't care about, but a list of possible users I want
2005-09-16T09:01:00.000Z	Bac9	dabaRCo	does the standard greater have the browser?
2005-09-16T09:01:00.000Z	Bac9	dabaRCo	I tried graphical greeter and some themes do have browser but it has no users in it
2005-09-16T09:02:00.000Z	Bac9	dabaRCo	it's called gdmlogin
2005-09-16T09:03:00.000Z	Bac9	dabaRCo	in any case I don't really care which one I use as long as there's a user list with _actual_ users
2005-09-16T09:03:00.000Z	Bac9	dabaRCo	I tried both gdmlogin and gdmgreeter
2005-09-16T09:04:00.000Z	Bac9	dabaRCo	Greeter= parameter in gdm.conf
2005-09-16T09:04:00.000Z	dabaRCo	Bac9	you played with that already?
2005-09-16T09:05:00.000Z	Bac9	dabaRCo	yeah, kinda, but can't get a user list at all in gdmlogin and in gdmgreeter the themes with userlist just bring up an empty list
2005-09-16T09:05:00.000Z	dabaRCo	Bac9	did you back up the initial file?
2005-09-16T09:06:00.000Z	Bac9	dabaRCo	I've not erased anything, just comented out what was there, so I kinda have the original
2005-09-16T09:07:00.000Z	dabaRCo	Bac9	well, what I would do, is restore the original. Then, I would set up the graphical greeter to happy gnome with browser, and that would give me what I understand you want./
2005-09-16T09:08:00.000Z	Bac9	dabaRCo	I can set up "happy gnome with browser" but the browser list is empty
2005-09-16T09:08:00.000Z	Bac9	dabaRCo	if I allow all users on the system to be there then it only finds two system users
2005-09-16T09:09:00.000Z	Bac9	dabaRCo	it doesn't find any users above uid1000
2005-09-16T09:09:00.000Z	dabaRCo	Bac9	well, that is strange. its just worked here before.
2005-09-16T09:09:00.000Z	Bac9	dabaRCo	and everyone in #gnome on irc.gnome.org is sleeping
2005-09-16T09:09:00.000Z	Bac9	dabaRCo	any advice?
2005-09-16T09:09:00.000Z	dabaRCo	Bac9	no, not really...
2005-09-16T09:11:00.000Z	Bac9	dabaRCo	know any place that I can get advice from?
