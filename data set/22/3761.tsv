2008-06-25T19:27:00.000Z	Sylphid|work		hello, im having some issues with my realtek wireless adapter... lsusb reveals the ID 0bda:8187 ... the problem is that the wireless adapters range is significantly lower when using ubuntu vs windows
2008-06-25T19:28:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Sylphid|work	Is that a USB adapter? the lsusb ID looks familiar
2008-06-25T19:28:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	ASULutzy	yes it is
2008-06-25T19:28:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Sylphid|work	the trendnet tew-424ub?
2008-06-25T19:29:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Sylphid|work	Or maybe mine is just close to that, heh, I don't have it plugged in right now :P
2008-06-25T19:29:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	ASULutzy	im not to sure how can i check without cracking the case?
2008-06-25T21:47:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Sylphid|work	Is the range actually less or do the bars just appear lower than your used to?
2008-06-25T21:47:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	ASULutzy	the range is less
2008-06-25T21:48:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Sylphid|work	Are you using native linux drivers or ndiswrapper?
2008-06-25T21:48:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	ASULutzy	native
2008-06-25T21:49:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Sylphid|work	Heh, I don't know then :) I have the same lsusb id on my trendnet tew424-ub and use native linux drivers and I notice the range on it is far far less than my internal broadcom which is using ndiswrapper
2008-06-25T21:49:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	ASULutzy	at a range of about 50ft or so when in windows I have no packet loss with 1ms response time but in ubuntu i cant even pass traffic until i move about 5 ft closer
2008-06-25T21:50:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Sylphid|work	fozilla: I'm unaware of a way to "crank up the juice" to a wireless card... Maybe something in iwconfig I'm unaware of
2008-06-25T21:51:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Sylphid|work	maybe iwconfig wlan0 power on|off|etc would help
2008-06-25T21:51:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	ASULutzy	i have tried changing the txpower but it maxes at 27db (501mw)... even tried bumping it down to 20db (251mw) thinking it might be over powering and sending dirty signal but no help
2008-06-25T21:51:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Sylphid|work	That changes the power manage attributes and modes of the device
2008-06-25T21:53:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	ASULutzy	turning off power management gives this error
2008-06-25T21:53:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Sylphid|work	I'm recompiling the drivers for my tew-424ub right now and then I'll see if I can play around with it
2008-06-25T21:54:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	ASULutzy	ty
2008-06-25T21:57:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Sylphid|work	Hmmm yea... http://paste.ubuntu.com/22900/ and trying to change any of the settings with power management gave me a Operation not permitted (as root)
2008-06-25T21:58:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	ASULutzy	hmm.... iwlist shows the txpower just fine for me
2008-06-25T21:59:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	ASULutzy	however the power management shows the same as it does on yours
