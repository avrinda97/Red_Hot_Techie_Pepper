2010-11-21T04:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	just install openssh-server and port forward port 22 TCP and you can connect to it
2010-11-21T04:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	are you using a router?
2010-11-21T04:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	i'd also have the server using static IP so DHCP lease expiration doesn't mess with the link
2010-11-21T04:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	makes life easier :)
2010-11-21T04:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	you can also install the DUC client on the server if its on 24/7
2010-11-21T05:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	try using tab to complete nics
2010-11-21T05:05:00.000Z	shmup	ActionParsnip	yeah, I was being lazy. :/
2010-11-21T05:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	its an extra single key,.....
2012-09-19T00:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	install lm-sensors and it should install what you need
2012-09-19T00:48:00.000Z	shmup	ActionParsnip	:/ hah well thanks, i'm glad that'll fix it
2012-09-19T00:50:00.000Z	shmup	ActionParsnip	hm, same situation. ./configure yells at libpeas
2012-09-19T00:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	what are you compiling?
2012-09-19T00:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-09-19T00:53:00.000Z	shmup	ActionParsnip	precise
2012-09-19T00:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alexmurray/indicator-sensors; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install indicator-sensors
2012-09-19T00:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	bit easier
2012-09-19T00:55:00.000Z	shmup	ActionParsnip	can you give me a .. hint.. on how to even come to that conclusion
2012-09-19T00:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	duckduckgo has a ppa search bang, or you can use: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas
2012-09-19T00:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	duckduckgo has:   !ppa indicator-sensors     and it will search the launchpad PPAs
2012-09-19T01:03:00.000Z	shmup	ActionParsnip	the actual problem was.. libpeas-1.0 wasnt good enough, because libpeas-dev worked
2012-09-19T01:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	nice
2012-09-19T01:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shmup	the bang syntax for searching PPAs is dead handy
