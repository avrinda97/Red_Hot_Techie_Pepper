2008-08-27T09:07:00.000Z	tico_		How can I format a partition via command line?
2008-08-27T09:07:00.000Z	therealnanotube	tico_	if you already have a partition, just need to format, look at "mkfs"
2008-08-27T09:10:00.000Z	tico_	therealnanotube	does that support ntfs file system?
2008-08-27T09:11:00.000Z	therealnanotube	tico_	yea, look at "man mkfs.ntfs" for details.
2008-08-27T09:12:00.000Z	tico_	therealnanotube	nt for man mkfs.ntfs
2008-08-27T09:13:00.000Z	therealnanotube	tico_	clarify what you said? what do you mean "nt for man mkfs.ntfs" ?
2008-08-27T09:14:00.000Z	tico_	therealnanotube	man for that returns nothing
2008-08-27T09:14:00.000Z	therealnanotube	tico_	how about "man mkntfs"
2008-08-27T09:15:00.000Z	therealnanotube	tico_	you also have to install package 'ntfsprogs'
2008-08-27T09:15:00.000Z	tico_	therealnanotube	nothing on that too
2008-08-27T09:15:00.000Z	therealnanotube	tico_	do you have that one installed?
2008-08-27T09:16:00.000Z	tico_	therealnanotube	let me check
2008-08-27T09:18:00.000Z	tico_	therealnanotube	I need to see if it has it on a boot cd im making
2008-08-27T09:20:00.000Z	therealnanotube	tico_	well, if it's not, that's what you need. ntfsprogs.
2008-08-27T09:21:00.000Z	tico_	therealnanotube	ok
2008-08-27T09:23:00.000Z	tico_	therealnanotube	i need to figure out how to get that on the boot cd now lol. I just need the boot cd to format a parition and copy files from an iso to it. backup/restore
2008-08-27T09:25:00.000Z	therealnanotube	tico_	why does the partition need to be ntfs, anyway? maybe it would be easier to just use ext3, or fat32?
2008-08-27T09:26:00.000Z	tico_	therealnanotube	its for windows
2008-08-27T09:26:00.000Z	tico_	therealnanotube	its for someone whos just starting off with computers in a diff. country, and if somethings messes up I want them to be able to restore it by just putting in one cd
2008-08-27T09:27:00.000Z	therealnanotube	tico_	so try fat32 - windows should have no problems with it?
2008-08-27T09:28:00.000Z	therealnanotube	tico_	unfortunately i don't know how to make a custom livecd, so i'm suggesting what i know. :) i'm sure it's possible to include ntfsprogs in there, i just don't know how.
2008-08-27T09:30:00.000Z	tico_	therealnanotube	well yea, hard part is figuring out how :P thanks for all the help tho
