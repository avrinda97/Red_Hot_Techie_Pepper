2010-01-19T10:58:00.000Z	syn-ack	brandon-	check out bleachbit
2010-01-19T11:00:00.000Z	syn-ack	brandon-	well... in Ubuntu that's kinda hard to say with somethings... really a default install is really quite small
2010-01-19T11:01:00.000Z	syn-ack	brandon-	They're called "threads"
2010-01-19T11:05:00.000Z	syn-ack	brandon-	I'd go to the site, download the correct edition and reinstall.
2010-01-19T11:14:00.000Z	syn-ack	brandon-	apt-get remove apache
2010-01-19T11:07:00.000Z	syn-ack	brandon-	First off, and I'm not trying to be rude or anything, I've used linux for more years than I care to admit and I'm going to tell you that while you CAN remove all that stuff you don't need, it's only going to cause you more of a headache that it's worth
2010-01-19T11:10:00.000Z	syn-ack	brandon-	That's one of the things I would personally keep on the system since removing it will also remove it's deps which include network manager
2010-01-19T11:13:00.000Z	syn-ack	brandon-	what does lsb_release -a tell you?
2010-01-19T11:14:00.000Z	syn-ack	brandon-	I understand you're upset but you really do need need to calm down now, or you won't be getting anymore help
2010-01-19T11:18:00.000Z	syn-ack	brandon-	After apache uninstalls you may also want to an apt-get autoremove to remove it's deps that it's no longer using
2010-01-19T11:20:00.000Z	syn-ack	brandon-	wth is this facebook thing you're talking about now?
2010-01-19T11:21:00.000Z	syn-ack	brandon-	ah.... thats why you need to check deps before you go installing things all will nill like that
2010-01-19T11:21:00.000Z	syn-ack	brandon-	synaptic will list the deps as will apt-cache policy
