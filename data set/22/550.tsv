2011-07-28T17:16:00.000Z	ronin___	dli	I need to install a virtual machine to install ubuntu on it
2011-07-28T17:16:00.000Z	dli	ronin___	cat /proc/cpuinfo is enough to see whether your CPU supports KVM
2011-07-28T17:16:00.000Z	ronin___	dli	and install some program
2011-07-28T17:17:00.000Z	ronin___	dli	KVM is it right for this problem
2011-07-28T17:17:00.000Z	dli	ronin___	KVM is better, if your CPU supports it, otherwise, you may try vbox
2011-07-28T17:18:00.000Z	ronin___	dli	Yes my support both of the cpu
2011-07-28T17:20:00.000Z	dli	ronin___	then, follow the ubuntu doc to install KVM, and guest OS, and you can use a program like ksnapshot or gnome-screenshot to get pictures of the installation (KVM window)
2011-07-29T11:15:00.000Z	ronin___	dli	I install and work with VMM but I need to open memory stick, Do u have any suggestion?
