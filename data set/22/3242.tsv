2009-02-05T06:17:00.000Z	nsgn		goodevening all. currently booted off the live cd on my living room computer, evaluating ubuntu for use on my TV
2009-02-05T06:18:00.000Z	nsgn		i'm having visual tearing and stuttering issues playing back full screen video content
2009-02-05T06:18:00.000Z	nsgn		the graphics card is fairly recent (but not cutting edge) nvidia. does the live-cd load all nvidia stuff?
2009-02-05T06:18:00.000Z	nsgn		if so, what are my options? if not, will installing fully give me accelerated video?
2009-02-05T06:19:00.000Z	usser	nsgn	no, it starts up with opensource noveau driver
2009-02-05T06:19:00.000Z	nsgn	usser	are you saying just on the live-cd?
2009-02-05T06:21:00.000Z	usser	nsgn	on livecd and when u initially install ubuntu it defaults to opensource driver, if your card is supported by ubuntu it'll prompt you to install a proprietary nvidia driver, if its not you can always get the driver from nvidia.com, heres instructions to install it manually from nvidia.com https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaManual
2009-02-05T06:21:00.000Z	nsgn	usser	awesome. just wanted to ensure i'd have smooth as butter playback on my HD tv
2009-02-05T06:22:00.000Z	usser	nsgn	what resolution?
2009-02-05T06:22:00.000Z	nsgn	usser	agh, i forget exact WxH. its 720p
2009-02-05T06:23:00.000Z	nsgn	usser	i'm connecting via a DVI to HDMI cable
2009-02-05T06:23:00.000Z	usser	nsgn	shouldnt be any problems, nvidia is usually pretty good at detecting resolutions, got pretty nonstandard 1360x768 detected out of the box
2009-02-05T06:23:00.000Z	nsgn	usser	awesome. hows video playback under ubuntu? i've never used it for HD playback
2009-02-05T06:30:00.000Z	usser	nsgn	with a powerful graphics card and cpu you shouldnt have any problems. although i dont think bluerays are supported
2009-02-05T06:32:00.000Z	nsgn	usser	i'm not doing bluray disks, but am playing back 1080 HD mpeg4 files. its a core 2 duo with a nice nvidia and 2gb ram. should be ok i'm guessing
2009-02-05T06:34:00.000Z	usser	nsgn	yea you should be fine, take a look at extra codecs though
2009-02-05T06:35:00.000Z	nsgn	usser	thanks
2009-02-05T06:47:00.000Z	usser	nsgn	yes you can
2009-02-05T06:47:00.000Z	usser	nsgn	get unetbootin, it even has a windows version
2009-02-05T06:48:00.000Z	nsgn	usser	i'm on a mac :/
2009-02-05T07:11:00.000Z	usser	nsgn	p3s are still great!
2009-02-05T07:11:00.000Z	nsgn	usser	im in the resale business
