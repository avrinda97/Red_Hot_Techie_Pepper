2009-05-06T08:48:00.000Z	Severian	mantis	on the remote linux machine, when you attach to the samba share, username should be guest,
2009-05-06T08:49:00.000Z	mantis	Severian	I guessed so. If I try with user 'guest' and no password, I get the result above. A fail message with 'failed to read shares'
2009-05-06T08:50:00.000Z	Severian	mantis	password should also be guest.
2009-05-06T08:50:00.000Z	Severian	mantis	that is a microsoft decision, not samba
2009-05-06T08:51:00.000Z	mantis	Severian	Isn't there a way to set it up with no password ?
2009-05-06T08:52:00.000Z	Severian	mantis	yes, but not an easy one.
2009-05-06T08:52:00.000Z	mantis	Severian	I've been follwing various docs that attempt to show how to set up samba with passwordless access.
2009-05-06T08:53:00.000Z	Severian	mantis	one step at a time.  Can you connect now?
2009-05-06T08:53:00.000Z	mantis	Severian	I'm still getting the above failure message.
2009-05-06T08:53:00.000Z	Severian	mantis	did you use my smb.conf file?
2009-05-06T08:53:00.000Z	mantis	Severian	And the share isn't visible from my windows machine.
2009-05-06T08:55:00.000Z	mantis	Severian	Sorry, I didn't see your paste. I got cut off from the nets for a few minutes.

2009-05-06T08:56:00.000Z	mantis	Severian	thanks. I'll give that a shot and get back to you in a sec...
2009-05-06T09:05:00.000Z	mantis	Severian	Success!
2009-05-06T09:05:00.000Z	Severian	mantis	Good.
2009-05-06T09:05:00.000Z	mantis	Severian	I can now see the shares on my ubuntu machine from my windows machine
2009-05-06T09:05:00.000Z	Severian	mantis	The windows machines should connect and not ask for passwords.
2009-05-06T09:06:00.000Z	mantis	Severian	That is exactly what is happening. I will look over the file you've given me and look for where I went wrong.
2009-05-06T09:06:00.000Z	Severian	mantis	Good luck.
2009-05-06T09:07:00.000Z	mantis	Severian	I'm still not seeing the shares from my ubuntu machine. But I'll take it from here before I ask for more help. Thank you very much.
2009-05-06T09:08:00.000Z	mantis	Severian	Brack10: which ubuntu are you using ?
