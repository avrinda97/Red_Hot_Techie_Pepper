2008-05-13T15:43:00.000Z	simplexio	ubuntunoob	best quess is that you need to go into bios and enable it
2008-05-13T15:44:00.000Z	ubuntunoob	simplexio	 the bios for my HP laptop is INCREDIBLY limited,  I notice the words "Bios Bug" flash when I load the live session.
2008-05-13T15:45:00.000Z	simplexio	ubuntunoob	what dmesg says about your wireless
2008-05-13T15:46:00.000Z	simplexio	ubuntunoob	in terminal type dmesg .. or dmesg | grep <something>
2008-05-13T15:46:00.000Z	ubuntunoob	simplexio	 dmesg?
2008-05-13T15:46:00.000Z	simplexio	ubuntunoob	dmesg shows kernel messages
2008-05-13T15:47:00.000Z	simplexio	ubuntunoob	so it should be able see if kernel did report somereason why wireless isnt working or if it dosent even notice that there is wireless
2008-05-13T15:48:00.000Z	ubuntunoob	simplexio	is there a way to search through the terminal for specific terms/phrases?
2008-05-13T15:48:00.000Z	simplexio	ubuntunoob	dmesg | grep net
2008-05-13T15:49:00.000Z	simplexio	ubuntunoob	means dmesg output is forwarded to grep which search line which matches ti its input in example "net"
2008-05-13T15:49:00.000Z	ubuntunoob	simplexio	WOW....
2008-05-13T15:50:00.000Z	simplexio	ubuntunoob	in linux, there is allways some way to do stuff in terminal effeciently
2008-05-13T15:50:00.000Z	ubuntunoob	simplexio	help me interpret what im seeing here
2008-05-13T15:51:00.000Z	simplexio	ubuntunoob	give me link into pastebin
2008-05-13T15:52:00.000Z	ubuntunoob	simplexio	http://paste.ubuntu.com/11826/
2008-05-13T15:53:00.000Z	simplexio	ubuntunoob	you did get it wrong... grep net was exxample, do like grep wireless or grep somethign you try yo look
2008-05-13T15:53:00.000Z	simplexio	ubuntunoob	and paste whole dmesg into there
2008-05-13T15:56:00.000Z	ubuntunoob	simplexio	http://paste.ubuntu.com/11827/
