2005-10-17T16:32:00.000Z	xml-blog		hi all, anyone up for helping out with a breezy upgrade problem? I am halfway through the upgrade and it errored out dpkg-deb: subprocess paste killed by signal (Broken pipe)
2005-10-17T16:32:00.000Z	xml-blog		.
2005-10-17T16:33:00.000Z	xml-blog		i am running a gnome session but it's dying trying to update kde libs
2005-10-17T16:33:00.000Z	foXgamer	xml-blog	How did you do the upgrade? Through apt-get or using the upgrade gui?
2005-10-17T16:35:00.000Z	foXgamer	xml-blog	If you use the update gui program, you can de-select the gdk and just keep gnome updates.
2005-10-17T16:36:00.000Z	foXgamer	xml-blog	When you come to upgrade, you can go through them and de-select anything that you don't need.
2005-10-17T16:39:00.000Z	foXgamer	xml-blog	Are you using breezy?
2005-10-17T16:41:00.000Z	foXgamer	xml-blog	This may solve your problems. Breezy is very gnome friendly. I use it fine :)
2005-10-17T16:42:00.000Z	xml-blog	foXgamer	it's if failing *during* the upgrade to breezy. hoary was a-ok.
2005-10-17T16:43:00.000Z	foXgamer	xml-blog	hmm. I am guessing that you have already checked the possibility of a cd error?
2005-10-17T16:43:00.000Z	xml-blog	foXgamer	not using CD. Upgrading from hoary via apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-10-17T16:44:00.000Z	foXgamer	xml-blog	Ah. I have never done that so I can't think what it could be. Unless there is a conflict between the two. Have you tried running from the prompt rather than the gui?
2005-10-17T16:45:00.000Z	xml-blog	foXgamer	yes i was running from gnome-term
2005-10-17T16:45:00.000Z	xml-blog	foXgamer	scary huh?
2005-10-17T16:45:00.000Z	foXgamer	xml-blog	hehe. Does sound like it :) I mean from the prompt - actually come right out of the gui back to the prompt
2005-10-17T16:46:00.000Z	xml-blog	foXgamer	oh you mean quit X
2005-10-17T16:46:00.000Z	foXgamer	xml-blog	Yes. If there is a conflict with the current gnome-gui, then this should solve that problem.
2005-10-17T16:46:00.000Z	xml-blog	foXgamer	been running linux 6 months, not that brave yet ;)
2005-10-17T16:46:00.000Z	xml-blog	foXgamer	will try if all else fails ;)
2005-10-17T16:47:00.000Z	foXgamer	xml-blog	Have faith in yourself! I've only been using linux for two months. The thing to remember is that everything you do can be undone
2005-10-17T06:03:00.000Z	foXgamer	xml-blog	look at man apt-get
2005-10-17T06:06:00.000Z	foXgamer	xml-blog	Don't worry. It's still all new to me too.
