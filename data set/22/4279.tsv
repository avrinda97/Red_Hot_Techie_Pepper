2008-01-31T04:20:00.000Z	linchapulin		Anyone had trouble with Audacity closing down when clicking the record button?
2008-01-31T04:22:00.000Z	linchapulin		Ironman1::
2008-01-31T04:23:00.000Z	linchapulin		Ironman1:: Sorry bout that...it is a file permissions problem that you have to correct with umask in your fsab file..I assume the external drive is ntfs/fat32?
2008-01-31T04:23:00.000Z	linchapulin		Ironman1:: I meant *fstab*
2008-01-31T04:24:00.000Z	linchapulin		edueb:: What happens when you alt-tab?
2008-01-31T04:25:00.000Z	edueb	linchapulin	i can scroll between the apps
2008-01-31T04:26:00.000Z	edueb	linchapulin	but i want to see the apps on the panel
2008-01-31T04:27:00.000Z	linchapulin		edueb:: I understand...however I have never felt a need to delve into how to change the default way the panel is setup..sorry
2008-01-31T04:28:00.000Z	edueb	linchapulin	ok. do you think that erasing the gnome conf i can solve the problem?
2008-01-31T04:29:00.000Z	linchapulin		edueb:: Probably an unwise choice..I would see the config file itself in your home folder and see if there is any comments in there on how to change the panel
2008-01-31T04:30:00.000Z	edueb	linchapulin	i know but i'm quite new on ubuntu and i don't know where to put my hands
2008-01-31T04:32:00.000Z	linchapulin		edueb:: Well that is ok everyone starts somewhere...I would suggest google or ubuntuforum.org to search and see if anyone(more than likely) has wanted to make the change as you do
2008-01-31T04:33:00.000Z	linchapulin		Ironman1:: Or sudo -i
2008-01-31T04:33:00.000Z	edueb	linchapulin	thank you for the help ;)
2008-01-31T04:34:00.000Z	linchapulin		edueb:: No problem..BTW I did look in my own hidden directory you have to issue ls -al in a folder to see them..they are prefixed with a period..therefore hidden
2008-01-31T04:35:00.000Z	linchapulin		edueb:: There was nothing in there that looked like a config file...usally end in .conf  .... so it is more than likely in a different directory path
2008-01-31T04:35:00.000Z	edueb	linchapulin	yes i'm using nautilus with hidden files enabled. i'll try to make a copy of the dir and than delete the original
2008-01-31T04:36:00.000Z	linchapulin		edueb:: All that will do is to recreate what you already have there I believe
2008-01-31T04:36:00.000Z	edueb	linchapulin	but it should recreate with default settings
2008-01-31T04:36:00.000Z	linchapulin		Hey Dr_willis
2008-01-31T04:37:00.000Z	linchapulin	edueb	We are talking Gnome here no? Yes you are correct
2008-01-31T04:37:00.000Z	edueb	linchapulin	yes gnome 2.20
