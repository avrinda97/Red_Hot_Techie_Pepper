2006-06-11T09:32:00.000Z	h3h_timo		has anyone used an ipod with linux??
2006-06-11T09:32:00.000Z	Sivik	h3h_timo	it shouldn't be hard
2006-06-15T10:07:00.000Z	Sivik	h3h_timo	probably, but amd is better
2006-06-15T10:08:00.000Z	h3h_timo	Sivik	ive read better things about the intel centrino dual core for laptops
2006-06-15T10:08:00.000Z	h3h_timo	Sivik	its better for power saving and stuff liek that
2006-06-15T10:08:00.000Z	Sivik	h3h_timo	i don't believe that, thats what the new turion dual core are for
2006-06-15T10:09:00.000Z	h3h_timo	Sivik	also.. just so you know.. i wanted to get an amd.. but i read lots of reviews.. and i found a great laptop.. if you wana check it out ill give you a link

2006-06-15T10:10:00.000Z	Sivik	h3h_timo	but its a ati video card, and its hard to get ati to work correctly with linux
2006-06-15T10:10:00.000Z	Sivik	h3h_timo	especially the x cards
2006-06-15T10:11:00.000Z	Sivik	h3h_timo	i'm sorry
2006-06-15T10:11:00.000Z	h3h_timo	Sivik	but do you think it woudl be a good laptop otherwise?
2006-06-15T10:11:00.000Z	Sivik	h3h_timo	acer has good amd boards as well
2006-06-15T10:12:00.000Z	h3h_timo	Sivik	lol i already bought that one.. its being shipped as we speak.. im planning on getting another when i go into my junior year of college

2006-06-15T10:16:00.000Z	Sivik	h3h_timo	yes, i wouldn't buy it
2006-06-15T10:16:00.000Z	h3h_timo	Sivik	but, thats because you would want linux on it correct?
