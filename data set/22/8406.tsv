2005-08-24T05:57:00.000Z	DVSoftware	snorks	you don't need it
2005-08-24T05:57:00.000Z	snorks	DVSoftware	ok. would you like to help me tomorrow when i have cedega4-4-1?
2005-08-24T05:58:00.000Z	snorks	DVSoftware	I have to turn to mean means to get cedega :/ I live in Norway and don't possess a legal VISA to get an account on transgaming.org :/ I have money for it and I would gladly pay, but I can't. Is there any way you want to send it to me instead of me having to download it as torrent? :))
