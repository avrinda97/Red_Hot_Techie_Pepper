2008-12-30T09:40:00.000Z	Chaorain		is there a command to search inside all the man pages?
2008-12-30T09:40:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Chaorain	man -k IIRC
2008-12-30T10:11:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Chaorain	#xubuntu would be your best bet
2009-02-07T08:58:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Chaorain	Do you have the advanced compiz settings manager?
2009-02-07T09:00:00.000Z	Chaorain	WebcamWonder	I think so is that System>Preferences>Compiz Settings config manager?
2009-02-07T09:00:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Chaorain	Same path, but Advanced Desktop Settings (something like that... Advanced...)
2009-02-07T09:03:00.000Z	Chaorain	WebcamWonder	hm I don't see it
2009-02-07T09:04:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Chaorain	Wait, let me get the package name, I always forget it
2009-02-07T09:05:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Chaorain	^^
2009-02-07T09:05:00.000Z	Chaorain	WebcamWonder	k
2009-02-07T09:05:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Chaorain	Install that package to get the glories of everything compiz can offer :P
2009-02-07T09:07:00.000Z	Chaorain	WebcamWonder	apt-get says its installed with the latest version
2009-02-07T09:08:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Chaorain	System -> Prefs -> Advanced Desktop Effect Seettings, you don't see it?
2009-02-07T09:09:00.000Z	Chaorain	WebcamWonder	no just the Compizsettings manager.
2009-02-07T09:09:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Chaorain	That, my friend, is very weird
2009-02-07T09:10:00.000Z	Chaorain	WebcamWonder	I think it is the same thing
2009-02-07T09:11:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Chaorain	Does it give you a rteally big window with many diff plugin support optins?
2009-02-07T09:11:00.000Z	Chaorain	WebcamWonder	yes. Let me find a picture of it
2009-02-07T09:12:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Chaorain	Ok, that means you have it. They must have renamed it in Intrepid, anyways.. you can go into the settings of the 3d cube plugins and tweak with them
2009-02-07T09:17:00.000Z	Chaorain	WebcamWonder	ok, when I don't use distortion the image is the right size but when I use distortion it looks better but is out of proportion. can you help?
2009-02-07T09:17:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Chaorain	Compiz specific stuff, nope? I don't even run it. Plain old metacity for me :)
2009-02-07T09:21:00.000Z	Chaorain	WebcamWonder	thanks anyway. I really want good graphics
