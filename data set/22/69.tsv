2012-11-28T03:19:00.000Z	sam_nazarko		still no answer after a week so i'm assuming lvm and mdadm is broken in 12.04
2012-11-28T03:20:00.000Z	sam_nazarko		why does grub-install segfault on installing to an mdadm
2012-11-28T03:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sam_nazarko	Please pastebin the exact command you're running, and the complete output.
2012-11-28T03:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sam_nazarko	Well, it shouldn't segfault, but that's still not the correct command. grub's boot sector needs to be installed to a device that actually exists (at least as far as the boot firmware is concerned).
2012-11-28T03:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sam_nazarko	What member devices constitute this RAID array?
2012-11-28T03:22:00.000Z	sam_nazarko	Jordan_U	well running it on sdc/sdd which are my raid1 drives doesn't work
2012-11-28T03:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sam_nazarko	What is the output of "sudo grub-install /dev/sdc"?
2012-11-28T03:23:00.000Z	sam_nazarko	Jordan_U	install has failed so i have chvted and am chrooted in with mounted proc, dev, sys
2012-11-28T03:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sam_nazarko	No.
2012-11-28T03:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sam_nazarko	Did you create the array from member partitions, or "raw" unpartitioned drives?
2012-11-28T03:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sam_nazarko	You can't do that, it doesn't leave any room to safely embed a bootloader.
2012-11-28T03:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sam_nazarko	For msdos labels the area between the MBR and first partition is used.
2012-11-28T03:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sam_nazarko	Yes, more than enough.
2012-11-28T03:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sam_nazarko	You're welcome.
2012-11-28T03:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sam_nazarko	Make sure that at the end of all this "debconf-show grub-pc" lists the /dev/disk/by-id/ symlinks for *both* of the drives whose partitions make up the array (and no partitions, as grub's boot sector still needs to go in the MBR). If they're not both listed by that command, then run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc" to select them both (this will prevent problems on upgrades).
2012-11-28T03:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sam_nazarko	You're welcome.
2012-11-28T03:56:00.000Z	sam_nazarko	Jordan_U	still there?
2012-11-28T03:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sam_nazarko	Yes.
2012-11-28T04:02:00.000Z	sam_nazarko	Jordan_U	I see no references to /dev
2012-11-28T04:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sam_nazarko	Then the package isn't configured to install grub anywhere on upgrades. Run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc" to change that (it will also ask other configuration questions, you can keep them at their defaults). Space bar to select a device, Enter to continue to the next question.
2012-11-28T04:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sam_nazarko	You're welcome.
2012-11-28T04:08:00.000Z	sam_nazarko	Jordan_U	it booted
