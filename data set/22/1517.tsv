2010-04-25T00:50:00.000Z	mozir		I'm trying to get started with GCC, but it keeps saying that my input file doesn't exist. Where do I have to put it so I can just access it via "gcc myfile.cpp"?
2010-04-25T00:52:00.000Z	mozir		Sorry, disconnected. Does somebody know what I'm doing wrong with GCC?
2010-04-25T00:54:00.000Z	mozir		Okay... I tried it with putting sudo in front of the command and it worked.
2010-04-25T00:54:00.000Z	mozir		Seems like you always have to put sudo in front of every command just so
2010-04-25T00:55:00.000Z	mozir		Works better then huh?
2010-04-25T00:55:00.000Z	guntbert	mozir	don't do that!  only use sudo/gksudo if you *must*
2010-04-25T00:56:00.000Z	mozir	guntbert	Not even g++/gcc works without sudo
2010-04-25T00:56:00.000Z	guntbert	mozir	then you did something *very* wrong with your system
2010-04-25T00:57:00.000Z	mozir	guntbert	Just installed.
2010-04-25T00:57:00.000Z	guntbert	mozir	please be serious - I installed scores of systems - such a case never occured to me
2010-04-25T01:05:00.000Z	guntbert	mozir	please pastebin the output of ls -la /home/myacc/Desktop
2010-04-25T01:10:00.000Z	guntbert	mozir	good - but still it worries me that you seem to "need sudo for everything"  - is that so or was it exaggerated a bit?
2010-04-25T01:11:00.000Z	mozir	guntbert	I'm new and got confused by something in the terminal making me think the cwd is /Desktop
2010-04-25T01:11:00.000Z	mozir	guntbert	But gcc tried to run in /home, which I don't have the rights for
2010-04-25T01:11:00.000Z	mozir	guntbert	So I just tried sudo and it logically worked
2010-04-25T01:13:00.000Z	guntbert	mozir	oh, ok - yes thats the "solution" - but please keep in mind that it is mainly the reduced rights for a normal user, that makes linux less prone to viruses and such things
2010-04-25T01:14:00.000Z	guntbert	mozir	so needing sudo should always be sort of an alarm signal: "possible danger ahead"
2010-04-25T01:14:00.000Z	mozir	guntbert	I know, and it indeed was a bit exaggerated
2010-04-25T01:15:00.000Z	guntbert	mozir	next security thing: normally the "current directory" is not in the search path for executable programs so you would type ./hw  in the directory
2010-04-25T01:22:00.000Z	guntbert	mozir	edit .profile in your home directory, it contains settings for PATH, you can use the last 3 lines as example
2010-04-25T01:22:00.000Z	mozir	guntbert	Thanks a lot
2010-04-25T01:23:00.000Z	guntbert	mozir	have fun with ubuntu :)
