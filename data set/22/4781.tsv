2008-04-28T03:07:00.000Z	Odd-rationale		I'm trying out freenx for the first time, however, I am getting an error whenever I try to add a user to the nxserver. Does anyone know much about freenx? Thanks!
2008-04-28T03:08:00.000Z	ubutom	Odd-rationale	I installed it a while ago on an old desktop of mine, I simply login there with my user-account i created on that machine
2008-04-28T03:09:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubutom	yeah, but when I do "sudo nxserver --useradd odd-rationale" I get an some errors...
2008-04-28T03:10:00.000Z	ubutom	Odd-rationale	If you already have an user account there, it should suffice to login with your user-account. it uses ssh, so it should work
2008-04-28T03:11:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubutom	I don't have to add it to nx user list?
2008-04-28T03:12:00.000Z	ubutom	Odd-rationale	no, if you simply use the nx client on another pc and use your user account on the remote server, it will work
2008-04-28T03:12:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubutom	ok. i'll try...
2008-04-28T03:12:00.000Z	ubutom	Odd-rationale	did and does for me ;-)
2008-04-28T03:12:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubutom	thanks!
2008-04-28T03:13:00.000Z	ubutom	Odd-rationale	did it work?
2008-04-28T03:13:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubutom	hold on. I'll report back...
2008-04-28T03:42:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubutom	It didn't work...
2008-04-28T03:43:00.000Z	ubutom	Odd-rationale	Mine still works, just tested it with my old machine
2008-04-28T03:44:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubutom	did you need to configure the nxserver in anyway?
2008-04-28T03:44:00.000Z	ubutom	Odd-rationale	As I said, I have a user account on that other machine, i login there with the password that user has on the remote machine, and it works. Didnt have to add a user there
2008-04-28T03:44:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubutom	what did you use as hostname?
2008-04-28T03:45:00.000Z	ubutom	Odd-rationale	its a way back, I dont remember if i had to set up something, but im pretty sure i didnt have to add a user.
2008-04-28T03:45:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubutom	ok. Thanks for the help. I'll try reading some more documentation...
2008-04-28T03:45:00.000Z	ubutom	Odd-rationale	In my case its the name of the remote server, i call it PIII for the Pentium III Coppermine inside ;-)
2008-04-28T03:47:00.000Z	ubutom	Odd-rationale	Anyway, nx is a nice thing.... its better than vnc imo
2008-04-28T03:47:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubutom	seems faster...
2008-04-28T03:48:00.000Z	ubutom	Odd-rationale	It is :-)
