2007-03-31T09:25:00.000Z	Foon		just because of the log file
2007-03-31T09:26:00.000Z	Foon		from 1995-ish
2007-03-31T09:26:00.000Z	Foon		what're the odds?
2007-03-31T09:26:00.000Z	Foon		(probably nil?)
2007-03-31T09:26:00.000Z	Foon		it wasn't important anyway
2007-03-31T09:28:00.000Z	Foon		so, does the .xsession-errors file just continue to grow like that?
2007-03-31T09:28:00.000Z	Foon		should I add a cron job that deletes it on occasion or something?
2007-03-31T09:30:00.000Z	Foon		...
2007-03-31T09:30:00.000Z	Foon		I just deleted the 7GB log file
2007-03-31T09:30:00.000Z	Foon		but conky (on my linux screen) says I only gained 0.01GB?
2007-03-31T09:30:00.000Z	vox754	Foon	I wasn't following that, so tell me, what 7 GB log?
2007-03-31T09:31:00.000Z	Foon	vox754	.xsession-errors caused by cmatrix misfiring
2007-03-31T09:32:00.000Z	Foon	vox754	anyone?
2007-03-31T09:32:00.000Z	vox754	Foon	reboot?
2007-03-31T09:33:00.000Z	Foon	vox754	why should I have to? ..honest question
2007-03-31T09:33:00.000Z	vox754	Foon	YES. Reboot is a good way. Honest answer.
2007-03-31T09:34:00.000Z	Foon	vox754	heh
2007-03-31T09:42:00.000Z	Foon	vox754	you were right, conky now displays 16GBs free as it should
2007-03-31T09:43:00.000Z	vox754	Foon	I'm glad. I guess reboot works from time to time.
2007-03-31T09:43:00.000Z	Foon	vox754	yeah, but why didn't the change get noticed right away?
2007-03-31T09:44:00.000Z	vox754	Foon	who knows, maybe some unfinished process
2007-03-31T09:44:00.000Z	Foon	vox754	oh, weird
