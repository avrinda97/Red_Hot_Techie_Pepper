2008-12-19T14:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raylu	theres a tool to populat the xorg.conf file
2008-12-19T14:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raylu	if you run gksudo nvidia-settings with no nvidia driver loaded it tells you the command
2008-12-19T14:35:00.000Z	raylu	ActionParsnip1	oh, right. it's nvidia-xconfig, but yeah
2008-12-19T14:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raylu	yeah it should populate it good, that restart x server and rerun nvidia-settings
2008-12-19T14:36:00.000Z	raylu	ActionParsnip1	everything is crystal clear after reading mplayer manpage
2008-12-19T14:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raylu	try ffmpeg / mencoder ;)

2009-02-26T14:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raylu	is that synonymous with forwarding X or is that more like VNC?
2009-02-26T14:19:00.000Z	raylu	ActionParsnip1	it's a way of compressing X
2009-02-26T14:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raylu	oooh i like
2009-02-26T14:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raylu	thanks for the tip duder

2009-02-26T14:21:00.000Z	raylu	ActionParsnip1	i use mutt for e-mail, rtorrent, and there's mpd/mocc
2009-02-26T14:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raylu	i know but ktorrent has a rad web interface using php and XUL remote works bob-on with my G1 phone ;D
2009-02-26T14:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raylu	its like iphone+itunes = G1phone + amarok XUL remote
2009-02-26T14:23:00.000Z	raylu	ActionParsnip1	i have no idea why you would want iphone+itunes. i do everything remotely too, but everything runs in screen
2009-02-26T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raylu	mine runs on my g1 phone, i can do the same with mplayer
2009-04-30T14:25:00.000Z	raylu	ActionParsnip1	as a note, not quoting the *.wmv will make bash interpret it as all the files with a .wmv extension in the current directory if there are any
2009-04-30T14:26:00.000Z	raylu	ActionParsnip1	-iname
2009-04-30T14:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	raylu	ahhhh nice
