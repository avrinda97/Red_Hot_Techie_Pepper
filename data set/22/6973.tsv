2006-06-15T05:38:00.000Z	anarqi		well its up to you, either change the init.d directly or get xubuntu-desktop package which has service-admin
2006-06-15T05:38:00.000Z	anarqi		check the forums?
2006-06-15T05:40:00.000Z	anarqi		check your compiler (gcc) in synaptic
2006-06-15T05:40:00.000Z	anarqi		and mark it to reinstall or fix broken dependencies
2006-06-15T05:42:00.000Z	anarqi		mojojo fix broken dependencies
2006-06-15T05:42:00.000Z	Xgates	anarqi	say pop up Synaptic and look at this --->  xubuntu-system-tools I think this might have that
2006-06-15T05:35:00.000Z	Xgates	anarqi	well I was looking at rcconf and bum but those aren't listed so I guess just disable the files in /etc/init.d then
2006-06-15T05:37:00.000Z	Xgates	anarqi	I don't see any service-admin in Synaptic coming up
2006-06-15T05:43:00.000Z	anarqi	Xgates	dont apt-get that
2006-06-15T05:44:00.000Z	Xgates	anarqi	ahh
2006-06-15T05:44:00.000Z	Xgates	anarqi	ok, plus that is Ubuntu's version of XFce if I want to run it yea?
2006-06-15T05:45:00.000Z	Xgates	anarqi	ok thanks
2006-06-15T05:48:00.000Z	Xgates	anarqi	otherwise if I want to just disable the scripts you have to like chmod -x to disable them
2006-06-15T05:50:00.000Z	anarqi	Xgates	You should use update-rc.d to disable services from starting up if you dont use xubuntu
2006-06-15T05:51:00.000Z	Xgates	anarqi	ok
2006-06-15T05:53:00.000Z	Xgates	anarqi	since Ubuntu has gdm installed for Gnome, then what do you use to boot into xubuntu as a graphical manager to boot either Gnome or XFce? I know how to do all of this by xinitrc but I thought I'd go the display manager bootup....
2006-06-15T05:56:00.000Z	Xgates	anarqi	with update-rc.d it seems you need to know the runlevels, but how do you just stop something like lvm, what cmd would you use for it?
2006-06-15T05:57:00.000Z	Xgates	anarqi	ok so do the same for all the others like that I want to disable?
2006-06-15T05:59:00.000Z	Xgates	anarqi	ok thanks, and one last one, then if I wanted to enable it, how would I run it?
2006-06-15T06:01:00.000Z	Xgates	anarqi	what is your definition of a bootup service I don't follow
2006-06-15T06:03:00.000Z	Xgates	anarqi	ok so --->  update-rc.d lvm defaults ?
2006-06-15T06:04:00.000Z	Xgates	anarqi	what did you mean by bootup services, everything that is in /etc/init.d does bootup at startup, so to me I would call that/all of them bootup services
