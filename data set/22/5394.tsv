2007-05-12T08:28:00.000Z	usser	cjae	sudo dpkg --purge wine
2007-05-12T08:29:00.000Z	cjae	usser	thanks
2009-03-03T07:19:00.000Z	usser	cjae	/boot will go into sda1
2009-03-03T07:20:00.000Z	cjae	usser	right but what sector because I am getting grub error 18 which is boot boundry limit (8 gigs - new disk in old machine)
2009-03-03T07:20:00.000Z	cjae	usser	what I can't figure out is why /boot gets installed beyond sector 1023
2009-03-03T07:21:00.000Z	usser	cjae	its not that fine tuned, once you allocated spaced, filesystem decides where to put stuff
2009-03-03T07:21:00.000Z	cjae	usser	by default
2009-03-03T07:22:00.000Z	usser	cjae	and its usually not /boot that matters, /boot can be anywhere on the harddrive really, its the bootloader that spits that error, and bootloader is a small portion of code residing in the mbr or first 1023 sectors of a partition
2009-03-03T07:22:00.000Z	usser	cjae	but yea its really weird that it did manage to install itself way off limits
2009-03-03T07:23:00.000Z	cjae	usser	grub looks for /boot so is important
2009-03-03T07:24:00.000Z	usser	cjae	well did you try the suggested fix, ie create a separate boot partition in the beginning of the drive
2009-03-03T07:25:00.000Z	cjae	usser	can you tell what sector your /boot was installed too
2009-03-03T07:26:00.000Z	usser	cjae	i just don't know, the only thing i know is my /boot is not on a separate partition and my grub is in mbr
2009-03-03T07:26:00.000Z	cjae	usser	so I can see if a reinstall is necessary cause I would like to know if this is going to happen on all machines I want to install on
2009-03-03T07:27:00.000Z	usser	cjae	your setup is pretty normal, most common in fact, im not sure what went wrong, maybe the bios IS involved somehow, i did hundreds installations with pretty much the same settings
2009-03-03T07:27:00.000Z	usser	cjae	are you using RAID?
2009-03-03T07:27:00.000Z	cjae	usser	the ubuntu installer should not install /boot beyond 1023 though right, I wish to not a /boot first if it is just a installer
2009-03-03T07:28:00.000Z	cjae	usser	problem
2009-03-03T07:28:00.000Z	cjae	usser	no
2009-03-03T07:29:00.000Z	usser	cjae	i wouldn't know why it did it. But really try a separate /boot partition. its a good practice anyway. too bad ubuntu thinks otherwise
2009-03-03T07:30:00.000Z	cjae	usser	thats probably what I m going to have to do
