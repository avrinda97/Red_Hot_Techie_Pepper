2010-02-03T04:48:00.000Z	benkay86		I'm not entirely sure how to use the search command properly (try typing "help search").
2010-02-03T04:48:00.000Z	benkay86		However, you might at least try the following to command to get yourself into Windows:
2010-02-03T04:49:00.000Z	benkay86		root=(hd0,0)
2010-02-03T04:49:00.000Z	benkay86		chainloader +1
2010-02-03T04:49:00.000Z	arand	benkay86	mind the "set" root... there
2010-02-03T04:49:00.000Z	benkay86	arand	Thank you, that should be "set root=(hd0,0)"
2010-02-03T04:50:00.000Z	arand	benkay86	and (hd0,1)
2010-02-03T04:52:00.000Z	arand	benkay86	actually it co-relates well with the sda# notation so in that sense it's ok, still pretty weird to have two diff counters in one designation...
2010-02-03T04:53:00.000Z	arand	benkay86	There√§s always ubottus !grub2, and the official grub wiki...
2010-02-03T04:56:00.000Z	arand	benkay86	I do know that my Vista-chainlod looks like this: http://pastebin.com/m7ffc65cd
2010-02-03T04:57:00.000Z	arand	benkay86	so maybe the insmod ntfs is missing?
2010-02-03T04:57:00.000Z	benkay86	arand	My thoughts exactly.
2010-02-03T04:58:00.000Z	benkay86	arand	Do you happen to know the syntax required to get "search" to look for a file like GRUB's find?
2010-02-03T04:59:00.000Z	arand	benkay86	This pretty much says it all (NOT!):http://grub.enbug.org/search
2010-02-03T05:00:00.000Z	benkay86	arand	That would be funny if GRUB2 weren't the default bootloader.
2010-02-03T05:00:00.000Z	arand	benkay86	Otherwise http://grub.enbug.org/CommandList seems to have some doc for most of the commands
2010-02-03T05:01:00.000Z	benkay86	arand	It just points to the documentation from legacy GRUB.
2010-02-03T05:03:00.000Z	arand	benkay86	ah, right..
2010-02-03T05:17:00.000Z	arand	benkay86	Here's documentation for search btw: http://imagebin.org/83083 (vbox is convenient;)
2010-02-03T05:18:00.000Z	benkay86	arand	The other thing that irks me about GRUB2 is that the only way to obtain the information you just got is to reboot. In legacy grub, it was possible to go to the grub prompt simply by running "grub".
2010-02-03T05:18:00.000Z	arand	benkay86	indeed..
2010-02-03T05:20:00.000Z	benkay86	arand	apollo: OK, so it looks like GRUB2 is actually working just fine since it is able to load both the Linux kernel and the Windows bootloader. The problem seems to be somewhere later in the boot process.
