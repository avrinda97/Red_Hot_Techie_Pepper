2009-06-07T06:27:00.000Z	Flannel	InfoMoMo	You need to do sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-06-07T06:29:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	Flannel	apt-get dist-upgrade worked for mencode and mplayer, but linux-generic linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic linux-restricted-modules-generic are still KEPT BACK
2009-06-07T06:29:00.000Z	Flannel	InfoMoMo	dist-upgrade has them kept back?  Or upgrade?

2009-06-07T06:41:00.000Z	Flannel	InfoMoMo	Alright, your problem is because you have jaunty-proposedn enabled.  You need to disable it.
2009-06-07T06:41:00.000Z	Flannel	InfoMoMo	-proposed is for things that aren't yet ready for -updates, and sometimes (like today) they contain things with unsatisfiable dependencies.
2009-06-07T06:42:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	Flannel	ahh ok
2009-06-07T06:43:00.000Z	Flannel	InfoMoMo	Indeed.
2009-06-07T06:44:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	Flannel	 : thanks brother
2009-06-07T06:44:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	Flannel	Coke ?
2009-06-07T06:45:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	Flannel	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade worked
2009-06-07T06:45:00.000Z	Flannel	InfoMoMo	right. The issue was the -proposed stuff
2009-06-07T06:45:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	Flannel	i wanted to stay at the cutting edge of things, guess i was too close and was at the bleading edge :D
2009-06-07T06:46:00.000Z	InfoMoMo	Flannel	reboot required
