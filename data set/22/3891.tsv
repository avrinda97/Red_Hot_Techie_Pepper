2008-05-08T11:09:00.000Z	doug	cognatus	i was under sound prefrences i changed the output to alc883 analog.
2008-05-08T11:01:00.000Z	cognatus	doug	what kind of audio out does your mobo have and what are you using? looks like it thinks you're plugged into "front"
2008-05-08T11:02:00.000Z	doug	cognatus	movie player and not sure on the rest but i am using headphones.
2008-05-08T11:02:00.000Z	cognatus	doug	next to the clock on the top panel is there a sound volume icon? if so right click it -> Open Volume Control
2008-05-08T11:03:00.000Z	cognatus	doug	i mean what kind of hardware "female plugs" does it have
2008-05-08T11:03:00.000Z	doug	cognatus	yes and its a HDA Nvidia (alsa mixer)
2008-05-08T11:04:00.000Z	doug	cognatus	yes
2008-05-08T11:05:00.000Z	doug	cognatus	yes everything worked out fine.
2008-05-08T11:06:00.000Z	doug	cognatus	im under sound prefrences i hit test and i hear nothing
2008-05-08T11:07:00.000Z	cognatus	doug	try unplugging all your audio equipment (headphones, speakers, everything)
2008-05-08T11:08:00.000Z	doug	cognatus	i fixed it.
2008-05-08T11:08:00.000Z	cognatus	doug	O
2008-05-08T11:13:00.000Z	doug	cognatus	why does that make a dif?
2008-05-08T11:14:00.000Z	cognatus	doug	because some mobos have a feature where when you plug headphones into the front-panel audio it mutes the rest of the onboard audio
2008-05-08T11:15:00.000Z	doug	cognatus	ah ok well thank you for taking the time and helping me with this.
