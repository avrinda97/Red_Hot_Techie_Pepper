2007-01-15T15:14:00.000Z	Surfnkid		hi, is there a console player like amarok?
2007-01-15T15:14:00.000Z	Surfnkid		without all the memory boggling of amarok
2007-01-15T15:15:00.000Z	cld2	Surfnkid	are you takling about a cli or ncurses based music player?
2007-01-15T15:15:00.000Z	Surfnkid	cld2	yeah im using mocp now for mp3s but would that work to for online streams?
2007-01-15T15:16:00.000Z	cld2	Surfnkid	I dont know, I was going to say mocp. I havent tried with streams though
2007-01-15T15:16:00.000Z	Surfnkid	cld2	let me try n see :)
2007-01-15T15:17:00.000Z	Surfnkid	cld2	ugh... it works, i mocp with an amarok stream, thanks!
2007-01-15T15:17:00.000Z	cld2	Surfnkid	np, you fixed it your self ;)
2007-01-15T15:27:00.000Z	Surfnkid	cld2	hey trying to find a file on the hdd thru cli, do i use grep?
2007-01-15T15:40:00.000Z	cld2	Surfnkid	did you find that file? you would use find / -name filename
2007-01-15T15:41:00.000Z	Surfnkid	cld2	trying to, will use ur advice :)
2007-01-15T15:42:00.000Z	cld2	Surfnkid	if you know where it might be, like say /var you can do '   sudo find /var -name filename
2007-01-15T15:42:00.000Z	Surfnkid	cld2	thats for filenames right? and for a string inside a file?
2007-01-15T15:43:00.000Z	cld2	Surfnkid	if you know the filename you want to look for the string you can do grep pattern filename
2007-01-15T15:43:00.000Z	cld2	Surfnkid	if you dont you can used the -exec feature or find to execute a grep on each file it finds or you can pipe | to xargs and do the same
2007-01-15T15:45:00.000Z	Surfnkid	cld2	grep pattern filename < will that look in the whole root?
2007-01-15T15:45:00.000Z	Surfnkid	cld2	oh nevermind thats for string sorry
2007-01-15T15:45:00.000Z	cld2	Surfnkid	grep pattern * will look
2007-01-15T15:45:00.000Z	cld2	Surfnkid	how about you tell me what you are trying to find and ill show you how?
2007-01-15T15:46:00.000Z	Surfnkid	cld2	ok well its an xml file i had the name close, its Cool-Streams.xml which ive already found, but i wasnt sure where it was. but its /usr/share/apps/amarok
2007-01-15T15:47:00.000Z	cld2	Surfnkid	ok cool.
2007-01-15T15:48:00.000Z	Surfnkid	cld2	now i have to drill those commands in me so i dont forget them lol
