2008-10-10T07:21:00.000Z	mynameistux		can I ask pc hardware related questions here, or is it strictly ubuntu only?
2008-10-10T07:22:00.000Z	mynameistux		you know how people say certain old computers will only recognise a HDD up to a certain size, why is that, or is it all FUD?
2008-10-10T07:23:00.000Z	mynameistux		I have a computer from 2002, running ubuntu server, and I want to know if I can put a 1TB hdd into it
2008-10-10T07:23:00.000Z	mynameistux		so, its purely a windows related thing, I thought it might have somthing to do with the BIOS
2008-10-10T07:24:00.000Z	mynameistux		it will prolly be fat32
2008-10-10T07:24:00.000Z	mynameistux		k, thx
2008-10-10T07:25:00.000Z	mynameistux		ooookay, why
2008-10-10T07:25:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	mynameistux	the windows nt 5.x installer will refuse to install partitions larger than 20g as fat32, even though fat32 can support larger drives.  Maybe that fact has contributed to the rumors you hear
2008-10-10T07:26:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	mynameistux	so that includes windows 2000/xp/vista
2008-10-10T07:26:00.000Z	mynameistux		I remeber reading something about that, wikipedia has a table of various filesystems maximum file size, and maximium FS size
2008-10-10T07:27:00.000Z	mynameistux		well, I might want to acces somthing dicercly with a windows pc, the chances are slim, but I may want to use windows for gaming one day
2008-10-10T07:27:00.000Z	mynameistux		so, I want to use somthing accesible to windows and lnx
2008-10-10T07:28:00.000Z	mynameistux		aaah screw it, ext3, if I need to use windows, I will DL the ext3 thing for windows
2008-10-10T07:28:00.000Z	mynameistux		I support open standereds, w00t, go me etc
2008-10-10T07:28:00.000Z	mynameistux		yeah, thats what I will get if I need to
2008-10-10T07:29:00.000Z	mynameistux		yeah, but you never no what will come up
2008-10-10T07:30:00.000Z	mynameistux		as I said, the chances of my using windows for gaming is slim, I will prolly virtualise, but I want to keep my options open
2008-10-10T07:30:00.000Z	mynameistux		and, if I have a LAN party, someone using windows, might want to acces my server
2008-10-10T07:30:00.000Z	mynameistux	neeto	is right, but I don't want to pay for a windows licence
2008-10-10T07:31:00.000Z	mynameistux		they can go and get the ext3 thing, its not my problem
2008-10-10T07:31:00.000Z	mynameistux		yeah, I never pay for stuff, but when I am in a forum or on irc, I pretend I pay for stuff
2008-10-10T07:31:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	mynameistux	you can serve files simply with apache...
