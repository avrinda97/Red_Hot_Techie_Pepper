2012-07-06T14:21:00.000Z	gaelfx	gogli	if you're talking about keeping RAM open, that's not gonna do anything but take up more RAM every 15 minutes
2012-07-06T14:23:00.000Z	gogli	gaelfx	i know , it will take attention of the CPU but i want to understand all this stuff .I'm a learner not a expert .  : )  Just chill bro , i want to try every thing
