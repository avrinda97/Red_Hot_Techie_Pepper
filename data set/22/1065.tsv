2011-12-27T11:34:00.000Z	blackshirt	almoxarife	ohhh... maybe better run it on windows :D
2012-10-31T07:34:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackshirt	right, inf
2012-11-14T10:16:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackshirt	nat uses your host to dhcp, bridge uses your router and host only will not get out
2012-11-14T10:17:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackshirt	for normal access to the internet i use bridged
2012-11-14T10:17:00.000Z	blackshirt	almoxarife	when we use bridging, thats mean we still can connect to out in guest os ?
2012-11-14T10:18:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackshirt	bridged allows the guest to access the internet according to the rules set by the router, getting an ip from the router, nat would carry the rules set by the host
2012-11-14T10:19:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackshirt	to the world nat looks like the host squacking
2012-11-14T10:20:00.000Z	blackshirt	almoxarife	okey ... So is it possible to use our own local dns server in our guest to serve dns resolving ?
2012-11-14T10:20:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackshirt	you want to use the guest as in the guest running on the host as the dns server?
2012-11-14T10:21:00.000Z	blackshirt	almoxarife	i have setup private dns server in guest
2012-11-14T10:22:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackshirt	the guest cant be the only source for dns for the host, because the host will be/should be looking for dns service prior to the guest os being up, unless you can get around that
2012-11-14T10:23:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackshirt	i have a server on my internal network dishing out dns(cache-dnsmasq) but its up usually 24/7, so nothing else is left dns'less :)
2012-11-14T10:26:00.000Z	blackshirt	almoxarife	i want my own local dns to serve the guest os, not host
2012-11-14T10:26:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackshirt	then you want to run 'nat' , and let the 'host' dns-serve the 'guest'
2012-11-14T10:27:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackshirt	what is 'local', define that
2012-11-14T10:31:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackshirt	if you are running a dns server on your local net, and you want the 'guest' to use 'it', and 'it' is not the 'host' , then we are back to 'bridged' , the setting up of where the guest got dns would be done within the guest os
2012-11-14T10:32:00.000Z	blackshirt	almoxarife	local mean for dns installed on this guest
2012-11-14T10:32:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackshirt	what Jordan_U said
2012-11-15T11:52:00.000Z	blackshirt	almoxarife	what you mean with it ?
2012-11-15T11:54:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackshirt	<Stanley00> jiltdil: then chgrp that prog, and add user to the group. that's easy. <-- what Stanley00 said
2012-11-22T10:44:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackshirt	ntfs has to be fixed from the windows side
