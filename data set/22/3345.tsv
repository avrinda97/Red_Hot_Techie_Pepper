2008-11-24T01:27:00.000Z	paul68		Hi I know my question is going  towards off topic however I'm still going to ask it is there to your knowledge a distro that handles creatives xfi cards without a problem
2008-11-24T01:28:00.000Z	Slart	paul68	I don't think it's a distro problem.. more of a "creative being bad people"-problem
2008-11-24T01:30:00.000Z	paul68	Slart	lol ok but are there distros arround that don't react as painfull to creatives cards?
2008-11-24T01:31:00.000Z	Slart	paul68	you can run ubuntu with a x-fi card.. but there are no drivers available.. afaik there is only windows drivers available
2008-11-24T01:31:00.000Z	Slart	paul68	so.. the only distro that can use x-fi cards would be.. windows =/
2008-11-24T01:32:00.000Z	paul68	Slart	that was not an option lol
2008-11-24T01:32:00.000Z	Slart	paul68	there are supposed to be some beta-drivers from creative.. last time I checked they only supported oss but things might have changed since then
2008-11-24T01:32:00.000Z	paul68	Slart	those are a pain to install aswell
2008-11-24T01:33:00.000Z	Slart	paul68	be sure to tell creative that when you email them to complain
2008-11-24T01:33:00.000Z	paul68	Slart	the drivers I mean
2008-12-04T01:10:00.000Z	Slart	paul68	unmounting a partition doesn't hurt it in any way.. you can't unmount the system partition while using it, of course
2008-12-04T01:11:00.000Z	paul68	Slart	how do I resize it then?
2008-12-04T01:12:00.000Z	Slart	paul68	boot from a live cd
2008-12-04T01:12:00.000Z	paul68	Slart	and run gparted then
2008-12-04T01:12:00.000Z	Slart	paul68	exactly
2008-12-04T01:12:00.000Z	paul68	Slart	ok thanks
2009-01-16T01:39:00.000Z	Slart	paul68	imagemagick is great for command line image manipulation
2009-01-16T01:42:00.000Z	paul68	Slart	ok and what would the command be to reduce all images from directory x to 800x640?
2009-01-16T01:43:00.000Z	Slart	paul68	not sure.. it might be the "convert" command.. there are good documentation on their site
2009-01-16T01:44:00.000Z	Slart	paul68	here's some info on the convert command http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php
2009-01-16T01:44:00.000Z	paul68	Slart	thanks
2009-05-07T18:48:00.000Z	Slart	paul68	virtualbox
