2010-01-02T00:44:00.000Z	Snump		I'm trying to get my ATI driver working in 9.10 and I'm trying to install the linux-restricted packages
2010-01-02T00:45:00.000Z	Snump		I tried using apt-get but it doesn't find "linux-restricted-packages" module
2010-01-02T00:45:00.000Z	Snump		anyone?
2010-01-02T00:45:00.000Z	legend2440	Snump	you mean    ubuntu-restricted-extras ?
2010-01-02T00:49:00.000Z	legend2440	Snump	amd stopped supporting the radeon xpress 1250 so only option is the open source radeon driver
2010-01-02T00:54:00.000Z	legend2440	Snump	yes i know there are no proprietary drivers for that card you have to use the opensource drivers
2010-01-02T00:55:00.000Z	legend2440	Snump	amd stopped supporting the x1250
2010-01-02T00:55:00.000Z	Snump	legend2440	ok, sorry I missed that.
2010-01-02T00:57:00.000Z	Snump	legend2440	my problem is the screen has a max resolution of 1680x1050 but I can only go to 1280 x 800
2010-01-02T00:57:00.000Z	Snump	legend2440	so do I need the correct driver?
2010-01-02T00:59:00.000Z	legend2440	Snump	in terminal type  xrandr  is   1680x1050   and option?
2010-01-02T01:00:00.000Z	Snump	legend2440	no
2010-01-02T01:00:00.000Z	legend2440	Snump	what is the best option?
2010-01-02T01:00:00.000Z	Snump	legend2440	1280 x 800
2010-01-02T01:02:00.000Z	Snump	legend2440	I read that it has native res of 1680.
