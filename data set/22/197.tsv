2012-06-12T22:33:00.000Z	Antonis		my solution was to buy a playstation 3 :P
2012-06-12T22:34:00.000Z	csharp	Antonis	try 'sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gtk2-engines gtk2-engines-murrine gtk2-engines-pixbuf gtk2-engines-oxygen ibus-gtk libcanberra-gtk-module libgail-common libgtk2.0-0 librsvg2-common'
2012-06-12T22:35:00.000Z	Antonis	csharp	and then?
2012-06-12T22:35:00.000Z	csharp	Antonis	those are the "unmet dependencies" so try to install the original packages
2012-06-12T22:36:00.000Z	csharp	Antonis	can you pastebin the error?
2012-06-12T22:38:00.000Z	Antonis	csharp	here it is http://paste.ubuntu.com/1037742/
2012-06-12T22:39:00.000Z	csharp	Antonis	okay - I see
2012-06-12T22:39:00.000Z	csharp	Antonis	have you installed software with ppas? or any other custom debs?
2012-06-12T22:40:00.000Z	Antonis	csharp	plenty.. I also upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04 so it's a mess I believe
2012-06-12T22:40:00.000Z	csharp	Antonis	yeah - looks like you would have some cleanup to do before this would work :-/
2012-06-12T22:41:00.000Z	Antonis	csharp	been trying to avoid.. no time :\ and I don't know where to start.. isn't there a way to force install it or something?
2012-06-12T22:43:00.000Z	csharp	Antonis	there may be a way to force install each package, but it would not be recommended
2012-06-12T22:43:00.000Z	csharp	Antonis	I might consider a fresh install :-/
2012-06-12T22:43:00.000Z	Antonis	csharp	that's what I would recommend myself as well :p.. the problem is the time it will take :\
2012-06-12T22:48:00.000Z	Antonis	csharp	is there a way to remove all ppas and make everything back to default?
2012-06-12T23:06:00.000Z	csharp	Antonis	sorry - was focused elsewhere - you should be able to go to Ubuntu Software Center -> Edit -> Software Sources - Other Software tab and unclick the PPAs you no longer need, then 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
2012-06-12T23:09:00.000Z	Antonis	csharp	but it seems that not all ppas are listed there?
2012-06-12T23:14:00.000Z	csharp	Antonis	then you might need to 'sudo editor /etc/apt/sources.list' and manually comment out any other unwanted sources and move any files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ to [filename].old or something
2012-06-12T23:14:00.000Z	csharp	Antonis	(if you prefer gedit, just do 'gksudo gedit' in place of 'sudo editor'
2012-06-12T23:15:00.000Z	Antonis	csharp	so I can't just remove the files from the folder?
2012-06-12T23:16:00.000Z	csharp	Antonis	you can do that too - I'm just conservative that way ;-)
2012-06-12T23:41:00.000Z	Antonis	csharp	okay I have now removed each and every ppa except of 5.. I did dist-upgrade but nothing happened.. I mean nothing installed/removed/replaced... should I reboot or something?
