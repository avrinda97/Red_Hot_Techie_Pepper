2005-10-19T10:14:00.000Z	erikcore	haselden	i don't have any tabs opening here
2005-10-19T10:16:00.000Z	haselden	erikcore	have you modified your apt sources file?  transcode is available via apt
2005-10-19T10:16:00.000Z	erikcore	haselden	yeah, i added the ones listed on the dvd::rip site
2005-10-19T10:17:00.000Z	erikcore	haselden	i even tried to build from a tarball but i'm getting all sorts of problems
2005-10-19T10:17:00.000Z	haselden	erikcore	i just apt-get'ed dvdrip today and it works....hang on
2005-10-19T10:18:00.000Z	erikcore	haselden	it's saying i need transcode and i can't install that either, apt-get or build from source
2005-10-19T10:18:00.000Z	erikcore	haselden	infact, transcode seems to be the big problem
2005-10-19T10:19:00.000Z	haselden	erikcore	you running breezy or hoary?
2005-10-19T10:19:00.000Z	erikcore	haselden	breezy
2005-10-19T10:20:00.000Z	haselden	erikcore	do you have universe uncommented in your sources.list?
2005-10-19T10:21:00.000Z	haselden	erikcore	i didn't add any external ones...just uncommented the universe/multiverse
2005-10-19T10:22:00.000Z	erikcore	haselden	i uncommented both, and i've googled the shit out of this problem... it doesn't seem like a lot of people are having luck with transcode
2005-10-19T10:22:00.000Z	haselden	erikcore	maybe i got lucky.?? i did it a few hours ago, and dvdrip pops up for me
