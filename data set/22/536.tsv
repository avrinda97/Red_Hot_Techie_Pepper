2011-08-03T13:59:00.000Z	lpc2011		Error
2011-08-03T13:59:00.000Z	lpc2011		Could not open location 'file:///media/

2011-08-03T13:59:00.000Z	lpc2011		Thanks.
2011-08-03T13:59:00.000Z	lpc2011		sorry
2011-08-03T14:00:00.000Z	MrsB	lpc2011	is there anything in the cd drive?
2011-08-03T14:01:00.000Z	lpc2011		yes. the files and the cd drive gets mounted even it give the error message posted.
2011-08-03T14:03:00.000Z	MrsB	lpc2011	try with something you know that works in the cd drive. Im not certain but it appears it isnt actually mounted
2011-08-03T14:03:00.000Z	lpc2011	MrsB	yes. the drive gets mounted anyway, but it does not launch nautilus. I still have to click on it using Places on Computer
2011-08-03T14:06:00.000Z	lpc2011	MrsB	there is the live CD (10.04lts) on it right now.
2011-08-03T14:07:00.000Z	MrsB	lpc2011	are you saying you are running from the live cd or that it is just in the drive?
2011-08-03T14:08:00.000Z	lpc2011	MrsB	I'm not running from it.
2011-08-03T14:09:00.000Z	MrsB	lpc2011	I'd expect to see something like /media/disk or /media/cdrom or /media/<cd title> when it was mounted. Is there anything in your /media directory?
2011-08-03T14:13:00.000Z	lpc2011	MrsB	I sent my reply via past.ubuntu.com.
2011-08-03T14:14:00.000Z	MrsB	lpc2011	you'll have to paste the link
2011-08-03T14:14:00.000Z	lpc2011		sorry guys... http://paste.ubuntu.com/657797/
2011-08-03T14:15:00.000Z	MrsB	lpc2011	Is it trying to open the right thing when you click it in Places menu?
2011-08-03T14:18:00.000Z	lpc2011	MrsB	http://paste.ubuntu.com/657801/
2011-08-03T14:23:00.000Z	lpc2011	MrsB	Could not open location 'file:///media/(drive or cd-rom)
2011-08-03T14:26:00.000Z	MrsB	lpc2011	Im not sure how that menu is generated, I think its probably done dynamically. The only reason I can really think of for the error is that it is trying to open something which isn't there or an incorrect path to it. If that is OK tho then I would keep asking every so often and eventually somebody with moar brainz will come along :)
2011-08-03T14:27:00.000Z	lpc2011	MrsB	I tried the ubuntu forums, with no luck either. Thanks!
