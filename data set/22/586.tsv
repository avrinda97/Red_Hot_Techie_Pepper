2011-07-20T22:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Codehotter: root login is disabled so you will more than likely be logged in as your user.

2011-07-20T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codehotter	what is the output of: lsb_release -d
2011-07-20T22:57:00.000Z	codehotter	ActionParsnip	Description: Ubuntu 11.04
2011-07-20T23:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codehotter	try being your user and use sudo as the OS is designed
2011-07-20T23:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codehotter	is the partition mounted writable?
2011-07-20T23:18:00.000Z	codehotter	ActionParsnip	/proc/mounts shows /dev/xvda1 / ext3 rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,barrier=0,data=ordered 0 0
2011-07-20T23:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codehotter	did you try using sudo as your user?
2011-07-20T23:19:00.000Z	codehotter	ActionParsnip	No.
2011-07-20T23:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codehotter	worth a try.
2011-07-20T23:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codehotter	could always boot live cd and edit the file there. I suspect apparmor is stopping you as the OS is not designed to have root logging in, nor is it needed.
2011-07-20T23:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codehotter	yes
2011-07-20T23:25:00.000Z	codehotter	ActionParsnip	why?
2011-07-20T23:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codehotter	its an (i)nteractive sudo session and is closer to if you run each command prefixed with sudo
2011-07-20T23:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codehotter	does: gksudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces    work as your first user?
2011-07-20T23:28:00.000Z	codehotter	ActionParsnip	First of all, this is a console session, not a graphical session. Surely you don't believe I would start my graphical shell as root?
2011-07-20T23:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codehotter	you run EVERY process as root if you log in as root. Web browsers, email clients, everything. So a malicious web script will get full system access and can run riot on your OS
2011-07-20T23:30:00.000Z	codehotter	ActionParsnip	you missed the part where this isn't a graphical shell, and I'm administrating the system, using another system - one with a graphical shell - to check the web and my email.
2011-07-20T23:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codehotter	basically logging on as not root gives huge security which you gutted from your OS. The fact that you are asking WHY its bad shows your ignorance and is exactly why you should NOT log on as root and re-disable the account
2011-07-20T23:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	codehotter	its not the apps themselves. Its what others can do to those apps
2011-07-20T23:36:00.000Z	codehotter	ActionParsnip	what do you mean others can do to those apps? What apps? Apps in the official ubuntu repos can have malicious code?
