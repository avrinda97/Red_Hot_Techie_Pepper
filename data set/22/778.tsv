2011-03-19T21:40:00.000Z	Sary_		Anyone out there to help me out with some problems installing ubuntu?
2011-03-19T21:40:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	Sure, what's the problem.
2011-03-19T21:40:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	ok...
2011-03-19T21:41:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	Your bios actually has nothing to do with Windows
2011-03-19T21:41:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	Change the bios to ask you at boot time if you can.  Often that is much more clear.
2011-03-19T21:42:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	Well ever bios is a little different.  You're gonna have to hunt around you menus.  It's probably near the boot order option
2011-03-19T21:43:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	The bios is completely finished doing everything it does by the time windows is running.  If windows is even loading!
2011-03-19T21:43:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	I have no clue what 'go into set up using this key' is
2011-03-19T21:45:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	That is my suggestion yes.  If you tell it to boot CD rom then HDD and there is no CD in the drive or the CD is not bootable, then the machine will go to the hdd and boot windows.  That's probably what is happening wit the USB drive
2011-03-19T21:46:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	Don't worry about CD drive.  You don't have one and you're not using one.  I was just giving that as an example
2011-03-19T21:47:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	3 years with computers?!  How do you live?  Anyway, one of two things are going wrong.  One, the usb drive is set set up correctly.  2 the bios is not trying to boot it.  Unfortunately I can't think of a way to test each individually.  I suggest messing with the bios some more and at least confirm that the USB drive should have booted.
2011-03-19T21:48:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	If you can get the BIOS to ask you what to boot ti will be very clear whether or not the USB drive is set up correctly
2011-03-19T21:49:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	I'm not familiar with the screen you're talking about.  I can't say what it means.
2011-03-19T21:50:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	You got it. :)
2011-03-19T21:52:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	:)  have fun
2011-03-19T22:37:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	usb boot on a netbook right...
2011-03-19T22:39:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	You told it to boot a CD drive it doesn't have!
2011-03-19T22:40:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	ooooo
2011-03-19T22:40:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	Yeah the drive is not set up correctly
2011-03-19T22:44:00.000Z	Sary_	edbian	did I lose ya?
2011-03-19T22:44:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	I just don't know how to fix it :(
2011-03-19T22:44:00.000Z	edbian	Sary_	Good luck!
