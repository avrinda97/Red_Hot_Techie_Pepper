2009-04-11T14:19:00.000Z	adi1		i dont mean from inside ff
2009-04-11T14:20:00.000Z	adi1		multiple accounts?
2009-04-11T14:20:00.000Z	grawity	adi1	How about Thunderbird?
2009-04-11T14:21:00.000Z	grawity	adi1	Because they are _mail_ apps.
2009-04-11T14:21:00.000Z	grawity	adi1	There are many reasons why someone would not want a web-based mail.
2009-04-11T14:23:00.000Z	grawity	adi1	1) Poor internet connection. 2) Privacy. 3) Security. 4) Easier management of multiple accounts. 5) To annoy people like you.
2009-04-11T14:23:00.000Z	grawity	adi1	Not everyone uses Gmail.
2009-04-11T14:25:00.000Z	grawity	adi1	HTTPS only protects one connection - between your computer and the Google server. The rest is unencrypted. And about multiple accounts - you _just_ asked how to manage two at the same time.
2009-04-11T14:28:00.000Z	grawity	adi1	veloc1ty: Also, I invite you to #ubuntu-offtopic .
2009-10-03T17:58:00.000Z	grawity	adi1	Use ffmpeg.
2009-10-03T18:00:00.000Z	grawity	adi1	ffmpeg -vcodec mpeg4 -f avi -i file.vob file.avi
2009-10-03T18:00:00.000Z	adi1	grawity	: thanks
2009-10-03T18:01:00.000Z	grawity	adi1	Ah, forgot -acodec libmp3lame
2009-10-03T18:01:00.000Z	adi1	grawity	| so i should install ffmpeg from synaptic and that will do...?
2009-10-03T18:06:00.000Z	adi1	grawity	| i installed ffmpeg from synaptic but i cant find enywhere
2009-10-03T18:06:00.000Z	grawity	adi1	Accessories --> Terminal.
2009-10-03T18:07:00.000Z	adi1	grawity	| i dont know how to work it from terminal
2009-10-03T18:08:00.000Z	grawity	adi1	I already gave you the command.
2009-10-03T18:08:00.000Z	grawity	adi1	You can try avidemux, I think it has a GUI.
2009-10-03T18:08:00.000Z	grawity	adi1	But this is Linux, and everything's based on command-line programs.
