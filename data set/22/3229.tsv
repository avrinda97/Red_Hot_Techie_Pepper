2008-11-05T08:15:00.000Z	vasilisa		my little brother cant get wireless working. He's going to torrent XP and give up on linux if he cant. Help me save him, please :(
2008-11-05T08:15:00.000Z	Dominik2	vasilisa	is he hooked up to a active internet connection?
2008-11-05T08:16:00.000Z	vasilisa	Dominik2	He successfuly connected by wire, but he wants the wireless to run.
2008-11-05T08:16:00.000Z	Dominik2	vasilisa	the reason why i was asking is because I had the same problem untill I hooked up to the internet, updated linux, and then downloaded the drivers
2008-11-05T08:17:00.000Z	vasilisa	Dominik2	Their wireless is hooked up, we did update, and we used wcutter to acquire the drivers from broadcom
2008-11-05T08:18:00.000Z	Dominik2	vasilisa	does the connection show up under if you type: sudo lshw -C network

2008-11-05T08:22:00.000Z	Dominik2	vasilisa	do you have the wireless manager in your taskbar (next to your time)?
2008-11-05T08:23:00.000Z	vasilisa	Dominik2	The network manager is, no wireless manager
2008-11-05T08:24:00.000Z	Dominik2	vasilisa	click on it and tell me what you see, I see two categories: Wired Network (under which I see nothing) and then Wireless Network (under which I see a bunch of access points)
