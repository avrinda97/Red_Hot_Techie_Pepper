2010-09-05T21:49:00.000Z	martez89		hey when I try sudo apt-get update I get this error: W: GPG error: http://ppa.launchpad.net maverick Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: KEY. After that I put this in the terminal: gpg --keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys KEY. But than it says gpgkeys: key KEY not found on keyserver..
2010-09-05T21:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	martez89	I know those can be fixed but most the time I ignore the key errors.  I don't think it breaks anything it's just a security risk.
2010-09-05T21:51:00.000Z	martez89	sacarlson	I fixed two other errors like this, so I was wondering why this fix didn't work
2010-09-05T21:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	martez89	maybe the server is down?  maybe it has a mirror site.
2010-09-05T21:53:00.000Z	martez89	sacarlson	how do I check that?
2010-09-05T21:53:00.000Z	martez89	sacarlson	its about the http://ppa.launchpad.net maverick Release
2010-09-05T21:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	martez89	 you can go to synaptic and setup>repositories>download from
2010-09-05T21:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	martez89	 oh then they give you instructions on the ppa site but I'm not sure those have mirrors.  you might just have to wait till the server start working again in a day or two.
2010-09-05T21:58:00.000Z	martez89	sacarlson	I don't think the server is the problem, because I fixed two of those errors from the same ppa without problems, only for this one it doesnt find the gpgkey
2010-09-05T21:58:00.000Z	martez89	sacarlson	will adding the ppa again maybe solve the problem?
2010-09-05T21:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	martez89	 did you fix those keys today?  time is an important factor.
2010-09-05T21:59:00.000Z	martez89	sacarlson	about ten minutes ago
2010-09-05T21:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	martez89	I'm not sure
2010-09-05T22:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	martez89	 that ppa stuf is in flux they guy that wrote may not even know how to setup keys.  it's done by people like you and me.
2010-09-05T22:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	martez89	 ppa is try at your own risk.
2010-09-05T22:02:00.000Z	martez89	sacarlson	I now used this: gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv KEY and now it imported a gpg key
2010-09-05T22:03:00.000Z	martez89	sacarlson	thanks for your help :)
2010-09-05T22:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	martez89	see just a server problem they don't always work
2010-09-05T22:03:00.000Z	martez89	sacarlson	I will try another server when I get this problem again in the future
2010-09-05T22:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	martez89	I don't think that's an option on ppa.  but maybe they do.
2010-09-05T22:05:00.000Z	martez89	sacarlson	I think it was a problem with the authentication @ software sources
2010-09-05T22:06:00.000Z	martez89	sacarlson	Launchpad VLC is now added
