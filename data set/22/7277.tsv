2007-06-13T16:40:00.000Z	SveinT		Hi, my swap got messed up so I reformatted my swap partition. But how do I permanently mount it as a swap?
2007-06-13T16:41:00.000Z	SveinT		that will permanantly make it swap? tried the swap on option in gparted
2007-06-13T16:41:00.000Z	SveinT		but that only made it work for that session
2007-06-13T16:42:00.000Z	SveinT		I did nothing at all...I have no idea, but suddenly I lost the swap. WHen launching gparted it told me that the partition was of an unknown format
2007-06-13T16:43:00.000Z	SveinT		UUID=59c7443b-009a-44bb-9e29-20d21dc92a9d none swap sw 0 0
2007-06-13T16:45:00.000Z	mc44	SveinT	you need to change that uuid
2007-06-13T16:45:00.000Z	SveinT		mc: ok, I see...how do I figure out the UUID? :)
2007-06-13T16:46:00.000Z	mc44	SveinT	easier just to use the label
2007-06-13T16:46:00.000Z	mc44	SveinT	i.e. do you know what /dev/hd... it is?
2007-06-13T16:46:00.000Z	SveinT		mc: yes, /dev/sda5
2007-06-13T16:47:00.000Z	mc44	SveinT	then just replace the "uuid=blah" with "/dev/sda5"
2007-06-13T16:47:00.000Z	SveinT		ok, I see
2007-06-13T16:47:00.000Z	SveinT		thanks a lot
2007-06-13T16:48:00.000Z	SveinT		guess I gotta restart then and see...thanks again for the help

2007-06-13T16:53:00.000Z	SveinT		I don't think it worked.... swapon -a displays nothing and df doesn't display it as well
2007-06-13T16:55:00.000Z	SveinT	nanotaboada	I restarted so it should have updated
2007-06-13T16:55:00.000Z	SveinT		swapon -s displays the partition
2007-06-13T16:55:00.000Z	SveinT		does that mean it's working?
2007-06-13T16:56:00.000Z	SveinT		ah, so it's working
2007-06-13T16:56:00.000Z	SveinT		nice
2007-06-13T16:56:00.000Z	mc44	SveinT	see :P
