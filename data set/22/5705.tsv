2007-05-15T05:47:00.000Z	neosimago		hi guys. i've got a kernel compile that returns this error: any ideas why? ubuntu/ms/memstick.c:16:28: error: linux/memstick.h: No such file or directory :: ubuntu/ms/memstick.c:27: warning: struct memstick_device_id declared inside parameter list
2007-05-15T05:48:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	missing declare in a header
2007-05-15T05:48:00.000Z	neosimago	ikonia	that would be part of the code then?
2007-05-15T05:49:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	either that or it conflicts with the headers you have installed on your ssytem
2007-05-15T05:49:00.000Z	neosimago	ikonia	how do i set my headers and make them line up?
2007-05-15T05:49:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	you can't really
2007-05-15T06:24:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	I've told you
2007-05-15T06:25:00.000Z	neosimago	ikonia	and i've removed all but the default headers.
2007-05-15T06:25:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	1.) are you building a kernel or a module 2.) what module 3.) what kernel version
2007-05-15T06:27:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	answer my questions
2007-05-15T06:28:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	I'll ask you ago
2007-05-15T06:28:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	1.) are you building a module or a kernel 2.) what module 3.)what kernel
2007-05-15T06:29:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	1.) why are you building a kernel 2.) what version of the kernel
2007-05-15T06:30:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	what slack are you cutting out ?
2007-05-15T06:31:00.000Z	neosimago	ikonia	drivers that i won't load, and add drivers i do load into the kernel.
2007-05-15T06:31:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	seems a pointless task when a.) you don't know how to debug the problems b.) you have no reason to do it
2007-05-15T06:32:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	nope
2007-05-15T06:32:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	the kernel tree is fine - hence why there is an existing kernel
2007-05-15T06:33:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	you'r doing this from the vanilla kernel.org source ?
2007-05-15T06:34:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	you're going to make things hard for you
2007-05-15T06:34:00.000Z	neosimago	ikonia	my mistake, i got the source from Synaptec
2007-05-15T06:34:00.000Z	ikonia	neosimago	ok - so the source tree is fine as thats the one used to build ubuntu kernels
