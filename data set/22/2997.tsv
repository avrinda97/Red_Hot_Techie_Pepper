2010-08-15T06:52:00.000Z	BaKKaR		my question is, I am trying to install a php/mysql application and i have placed it in the script directory in the correct place. However when I try to begin the installation it says "This install has no rights to create or update file data.php. so I am not sure but I do belive this might be a file permission issue. Can someone shed some light for me on this one please.
2010-08-15T06:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	BaKKaR	I think you could use sudo install.sh  to have superuser access at install
2010-08-15T06:55:00.000Z	BaKKaR	sacarlson	what I am trying to install is a web application. Something is similar to joomla or wordpress where you go to http://path-to-directory/scropt/install.php. and it gives  me this error when i am trying to install it.
2010-08-15T06:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	BaKKaR	don't you have admin priv?
2010-08-15T06:56:00.000Z	BaKKaR	sacarlson	yes i do have admin priv but the thing is, how to setup a permission for that directory for the installer to work. can you help me with that pls as a starter
2010-08-15T06:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	BaKKaR	I think you need to setup the config dir to 777 to start setup security after it installs
2010-08-15T06:57:00.000Z	BaKKaR	sacarlson	so is it like #>chmod +777 directory-name, just like this?
2010-08-15T06:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	BaKKaR	that sounds good
2010-08-15T06:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	BaKKaR	man chmod
2010-08-15T06:59:00.000Z	BaKKaR	sacarlson	i have tried that but it is invalid mod, i think i the command can be setup or syntax is different
2010-08-15T06:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	BaKKaR	chmod 777 yourfile
2010-08-15T07:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	BaKKaR	take out th + you had there
2010-08-15T07:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	BaKKaR	oh or dir  chmod 777 /theplace/yourdir
2010-08-15T07:01:00.000Z	BaKKaR	sacarlson	ok i have tried that but still same error
2010-08-15T07:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	BaKKaR	just open the whole /var/www then
2010-08-15T07:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	BaKKaR	not sure what dir you put it in
2010-08-15T07:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	BaKKaR	 maybe it's just a symlink  make sure if it is that you chmod at what it points to
2010-08-15T07:03:00.000Z	BaKKaR	sacarlson	i have it saved in the /opt/lampp/htdocs directory, i am running the xampp server
2010-08-15T07:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	BaKKaR	so no symlinks?
2010-08-15T07:04:00.000Z	BaKKaR	sacarlson	no symlinks.
2010-08-15T07:05:00.000Z	BaKKaR	sacarlson	lemme take a second look as well
2010-08-15T07:08:00.000Z	BaKKaR	sacarlson	no symplinks there. Just the installation directory
