2007-07-03T08:28:00.000Z	ubuntuEdg1		pici  , i don't have a monitor connected to it
2007-07-03T08:28:00.000Z	Pici	ubuntuEdg1	so why do you have an xserver running at all?
2007-07-03T08:29:00.000Z	Pici		!dualmonitor | faidillinger
2007-07-03T08:29:00.000Z	ubuntuEdg1	Pici	i stopped gdm
2007-07-03T08:30:00.000Z	ubuntuEdg1		sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2007-07-03T08:32:00.000Z	Pici	ubuntuEdg1	if you arent using the xserver at all, you might want to remove the ubuntu-desktop metapackage.  Check out the dependencies first to make sure you arent getting rid of something you might need though.
2007-07-03T08:32:00.000Z	ubuntuEdg1	Pici	xserver is different from gdm ?
2007-07-03T08:32:00.000Z	Pici	ubuntuEdg1	well, just stopping the gdm is a temporary solution.  It will start up again next time you reboot.
2007-07-03T08:33:00.000Z	ubuntuEdg1	Pici	 i know how to stop it permanently
2007-07-03T08:33:00.000Z	Pici	ubuntuEdg1	okay :)
2007-07-03T08:33:00.000Z	ubuntuEdg1		can i stop xserver
2007-07-03T08:33:00.000Z	ubuntuEdg1		sudo /etc/ini.d/xserver stop
2007-07-03T08:34:00.000Z	Pici	ubuntuEdg1	er, I dont think theres an init.d entry for the xserver.
2007-07-03T08:35:00.000Z	ubuntuEdg1		ahh i see
2007-07-03T08:35:00.000Z	ubuntuEdg1		any thing i can help you with pici
