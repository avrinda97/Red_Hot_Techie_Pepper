2007-11-08T06:28:00.000Z	SuperSnout		So.. how would I go about installing azureus if i shouldn't do it manually?
2007-11-08T06:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	SuperSnout	Applications -> Add / Remove
2007-11-08T06:28:00.000Z	SuperSnout	Jordan_U	I can't find it in add remove
2007-11-08T06:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	SuperSnout	Did you set it to show all applications?
2007-11-08T06:29:00.000Z	SuperSnout	Jordan_U	I don't think i've set it to do anything
2007-11-08T06:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	SuperSnout	The option is in the top right
2007-11-08T06:31:00.000Z	SuperSnout	Jordan_U	thanks! :D
2007-11-08T06:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	SuperSnout	You can scan yourself thorugh a proxy
2007-11-08T06:42:00.000Z	SuperSnout	Jordan_U	how would I do that?
2007-11-08T06:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	SuperSnout	Use nmap with torify
2007-11-08T06:47:00.000Z	SuperSnout	Jordan_U	just downloaded nmap
2007-11-08T06:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	SuperSnout	I guess just keep using the service you were using :)
2007-11-08T06:48:00.000Z	SuperSnout	Jordan_U	service?
2007-11-08T06:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	SuperSnout	The site you were using
2007-11-08T06:49:00.000Z	SuperSnout	Jordan_U	what site? :/
2007-11-08T06:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	SuperSnout	online-nmap.com
2007-11-08T06:50:00.000Z	SuperSnout	Jordan_U	I just used the terminal command to install it..
2007-11-08T06:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	SuperSnout	scguy318 noted that nmap over tor will be very slow and I thought you already knew about the online services ( someone was talking about them and I thought it was you )
2007-11-08T06:52:00.000Z	SuperSnout	Jordan_U	oh, yeah, I'm not sure if the online service worked properly.. and I wasn't using nmap.. I'll check it out though
2007-11-08T06:54:00.000Z	SuperSnout	Jordan_U	it says I'm blocking ping probes :(
2007-11-08T06:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	SuperSnout	Then your computer probably isn't even accessable from the internet, have you set up any port forewarding?
2007-11-08T06:55:00.000Z	SuperSnout	Jordan_U	yes
