2009-06-05T02:33:00.000Z	DanDan		I have a noob Q .. lol ... does this command actually work ? >> sudo apt-get remove --force-yes .. Do I add the pkg name in the end ?
2009-06-05T02:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DanDan	odd command
2009-06-05T02:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DanDan	if you want to remove a program and it's config files this will work :)   sudo apt-get purge programname
2009-06-05T02:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DanDan	I can't see a need to use force in the command you gave,  you could just  sudo apt-get remove programname  and  that will leave config files or whaetver to
2009-06-05T02:35:00.000Z	DanDan	sebsebseb	: .. I wish I can burn those pkg config files lol ! is there anyway :| !!
2009-06-05T02:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DanDan	purge is for the program and it's config
2009-06-05T02:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DanDan	you could burn the stuff from /etc onto a CD I assume
2009-06-05T02:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DanDan	config files???
2009-06-05T02:36:00.000Z	DanDan	sebsebseb	: .. Yea I know and tried that it doesnt work :( .. .. and by burn I really mean BURN with fire ! :P
2009-06-05T02:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DanDan	are you usre your not getting mixed up here with program user data, for example the hidden .mozilla in home, which is your Firefox profile
2009-06-05T02:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DanDan	are you sure above
2009-06-05T03:37:00.000Z	DanDan	sebsebseb	: 1004112 kB equals how many GB :P ?
2009-06-05T03:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DanDan	don't know
2009-06-08T19:57:00.000Z	DanDan	sebsebseb	: so I can .deb packages but never a debian repository ?
2009-06-08T19:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DanDan	  Some  DEBS I think are made for both Ubuntu and Debian,  but most will only be made for Ubuntu or Debian
2009-06-08T19:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DanDan	or Debs are only made for Debian or Ubuntu
2009-06-08T19:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DanDan	by adding the Debian repos you will end up getting  Debian Debs, not Ubuntu Debs
2009-06-08T19:59:00.000Z	DanDan	sebsebseb	: ok .. I have this experimental debian repository in my sources.list ... and I have done an update after it ...someone in here thinks it might be the cause of the flashplugin broken package ... can I remove it all without a fresh reinstall of Ubuntu !!!?
2009-06-08T20:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DanDan	using Debian repos in Ubuntu is a bad idea,  it might have caused your issue,  but  recently  I have noticed a lot of people having problems with installing  Flash in here,  and none of them added a Debian repo
2009-06-08T20:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DanDan	weird how installing Flash  seems to have become a common 9.04 issue
2009-06-08T20:02:00.000Z	DanDan	sebsebseb	: .. I would love just to remove the flash from my ubuntu right now ! lol
2009-06-08T22:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DanDan	simple by knowing if you  have a 64bit proccessor or not
