2009-03-05T23:31:00.000Z	oCean_	edi_99	when JAVA_HOME is set, it runs just fine
2009-03-26T15:48:00.000Z	oCean_	edi_99	common opinion (from what I learn here) is that the sun package in the repositories works ok
2009-03-26T15:45:00.000Z	oCean_	edi_99	what jdk is on sun's webpage? Is it a .deb to install? Actually, in the ubuntu repo's is the "sun-java6-jdk"
2009-03-26T15:46:00.000Z	edi_99	oCean_	i did install that one but I cannot compile applets
2009-03-26T15:47:00.000Z	edi_99	oCean_	a guy i know said that I should go with the jdk pack on sun's web page, then it'll work fine
2009-03-26T15:47:00.000Z	edi_99	oCean_	I'm just not very "handy" with ubuntu...still learning
2009-03-26T15:48:00.000Z	oCean_	edi_99	is it installed correctly and default? (e.g. what do you get when you do "java -version" ?)
2009-03-26T15:49:00.000Z	edi_99	oCean_	http://rafb.net/p/KH47tC46.html
2009-03-26T15:50:00.000Z	oCean_	edi_99	ok, that is still openJDK, not the sun version
2009-03-26T15:50:00.000Z	oCean_	edi_99	have you done "sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk" ?
2009-03-26T15:51:00.000Z	oCean_	edi_99	If not yet, then do so to install the sun jdk
2009-03-26T15:52:00.000Z	edi_99	oCean_	should I try to uninstall it and then reinstall the jdk package form repos then?
2009-03-26T15:53:00.000Z	oCean_	edi_99	uninstalling the other version is not required. Just run "sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk"
2009-03-26T15:53:00.000Z	edi_99	oCean_	it says the latest version is already installed
2009-03-26T15:55:00.000Z	oCean_	edi_99	ok, so it IS installed. Then you have to set it as default. type "sudo update-alternatives --list java"
2009-03-26T15:57:00.000Z	edi_99	oCean_	OK, I've got Java 6-sun and java-6-openjdk ... I guess I should use the first one as default. How do I switch?
2009-03-26T15:58:00.000Z	oCean_	edi_99	indeed. Run "sudo update-alternatives --config java", then choose for the sun thing. Then try java -version again
2009-03-26T15:59:00.000Z	edi_99	oCean_	I believe it's done. Thank you very much for your help
2009-03-26T15:59:00.000Z	oCean_	edi_99	you're welcome
2009-03-26T16:00:00.000Z	edi_99	oCean_	 oh, another thing, is there any way to delete the other java version
2009-03-26T16:01:00.000Z	oCean_	edi_99	sure, if you really want it gone, "sudo apt-get remove openjdk-6-jdk" <-- if that is the correct packagename....
2009-03-26T16:01:00.000Z	edi_99	oCean_	ok got it. thanks again
