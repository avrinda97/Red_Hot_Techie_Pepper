2006-01-28T17:49:00.000Z	lightbright	quacker	 I only seek to make it most secure as human possible for me and still be connected to the Inet ;)

2006-01-28T17:49:00.000Z	lightbright	quacker	L(
2006-01-28T17:49:00.000Z	quacker	lightbright	apt-get install checksecurity aide cron anacron snort bastille
2006-01-28T17:50:00.000Z	lightbright	quacker	sounds complicated :P
2006-01-28T17:51:00.000Z	lightbright	quacker	whats checksecurity aide cron anacron snort bastille?
2006-01-28T17:52:00.000Z	lightbright	quacker	why did you say I shold install checksecurity aide cron anacron snort bastille?
2006-01-28T17:52:00.000Z	quacker	lightbright	look up the descriptions in your package manager of choice
2006-01-28T17:52:00.000Z	quacker	lightbright	they're not that hard to configure (except snort) -- they have scripts
2006-01-28T17:52:00.000Z	quacker	lightbright	you can also jsut by a 'broadband Inet gateway' or 'home office router'
2006-01-28T17:53:00.000Z	lightbright	quacker	im also using rootkithunter, that good?
2006-01-28T17:54:00.000Z	lightbright	quacker	you use rootkithunter also?
2006-01-28T17:54:00.000Z	quacker	lightbright	if yoiu get a rootkit that it know how to detect -- yes, but at that point I think you're hooped anyhow.
2006-01-28T17:55:00.000Z	quacker	lightbright	the best staregy is to KEEP rootkits OUT

2006-01-28T17:58:00.000Z	quacker	lightbright	I'd relax though, most worms and trojan propagate through insecure M$ implementations of protocols like SMB (NetBIOS/NTLanManager), HTML (IE/Windows explorer) ActiveX, DCOM+, RDP and of course SMTP 'M$ VirusLook Express'
2006-01-28T17:58:00.000Z	lightbright	quacker	ok
2006-01-28T06:08:00.000Z	lightbright	quacker	when I try to run bastille, it says: WARNING: /usr/bin/perl cannot find Perl module Tk.
2006-01-28T06:08:00.000Z	lightbright	quacker	any solution?
2006-01-28T06:11:00.000Z	quacker	lightbright	try installing Tk8.4 seperately and look in the 'recommended' section for the Perl mod (using Synaptic)
2006-01-28T06:12:00.000Z	quacker	lightbright	or search the Development section
