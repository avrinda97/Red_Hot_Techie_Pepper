2007-12-21T05:08:00.000Z	shadowblade		Don't know if people here can help with this...When I try to boot into my vista partition from grub, my computer just restarts and comes back to grub. Anyone have any ideas?
2007-12-21T05:09:00.000Z	nickrud	shadowblade	sudo fdisk -l , does that show your partitions? (just stab in the dark)
2007-12-21T05:10:00.000Z	shadowblade	nickrud	yep, theyre all there
2007-12-21T05:10:00.000Z	shadowblade	nickrud	i can see the partition just fine from here (ubuntu)
2007-12-21T05:11:00.000Z	nickrud	shadowblade	ok, my partition table got trashed by an install once, had to reinstall vista. Thats good for you. Is your vista on partition 1?
2007-12-21T05:11:00.000Z	shadowblade	nickrud	sda3
2007-12-21T05:12:00.000Z	nickrud	shadowblade	hm, a sec
2007-12-21T05:13:00.000Z	nickrud	shadowblade	sorry, I thought I had some down time at work. brb
2007-12-21T05:13:00.000Z	shadowblade	nickrud	np
2007-12-21T05:16:00.000Z	nickrud	shadowblade	while I'm finishing here, could you put your /boot/grub/menu.lst on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-12-21T05:21:00.000Z	shadowblade	nickrud	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/49088/
2007-12-21T05:27:00.000Z	nickrud	shadowblade	sorry, still here
2007-12-21T05:28:00.000Z	shadowblade	nickrud	np
2007-12-21T05:29:00.000Z	shadowblade	nickrud	only a couple thing i still use windows for
2007-12-21T05:33:00.000Z	nickrud	shadowblade	back for real now. Your grub looks good, has vista booted before?
2007-12-21T05:34:00.000Z	shadowblade	nickrud	yea
2007-12-21T05:35:00.000Z	nickrud	shadowblade	then I'm clueless, it's usually a problem with windows not being on the first partition (I never install it otherwise). Sorry
2007-12-21T05:36:00.000Z	shadowblade	nickrud	can i just like rename and rearrange the partitions so vista is on sda1
2007-12-21T05:36:00.000Z	shadowblade	nickrud	in gparted
2007-12-21T05:36:00.000Z	nickrud	shadowblade	not to my knowledge, no. Slart seems to know editing grub, maybe when he's done he can take a look
2007-12-21T05:36:00.000Z	shadowblade	nickrud	ok
2007-12-21T05:37:00.000Z	shadowblade	nickrud	thanks for trying
