2009-01-15T03:06:00.000Z	hatter243	KenBW2	you have to get your friend to tell you his public IP address
2009-01-15T03:52:00.000Z	hatter243	KenBW2	set up her router to port foward your request to her IP
2009-01-15T03:52:00.000Z	KenBW2	hatter243	what's the chances it'll already be set up as needed?
2009-01-15T03:52:00.000Z	hatter243	KenBW2	1%
2009-01-15T03:53:00.000Z	KenBW2	hatter243	suppose it was, what would i type
2009-01-15T03:53:00.000Z	hatter243	KenBW2	Unless she knows what she's doing and has done it before....
2009-01-15T03:53:00.000Z	hatter243	KenBW2	ssh 111.111.111.111
2009-01-15T03:53:00.000Z	KenBW2	hatter243	connection timed out
2009-01-15T03:54:00.000Z	hatter243	KenBW2	then port forwarding on her router hasn't been set up
2009-01-15T03:54:00.000Z	KenBW2	hatter243	on a scale of 1-10 how hard is it to do
2009-01-15T03:55:00.000Z	hatter243	KenBW2	pretty easy, but she's got to do it from her end. Look up the model of her router and google "Port Forwarding <routername>"
2009-01-15T03:56:00.000Z	KenBW2	hatter243	ok thanks :)
2009-01-15T03:56:00.000Z	hatter243	KenBW2	Good luck!
2009-01-15T03:57:00.000Z	KenBW2	hatter243	she's wip[ed Windows and ubuntu wont log in - so she's created a big metal box :D
2009-01-15T03:57:00.000Z	hatter243	KenBW2	You'll most likely have to be able to physically access the machine. SSH won't do the trick if it's a brick
2009-01-15T03:58:00.000Z	KenBW2	hatter243	Ctrl+alt+F1 works
2009-01-15T03:58:00.000Z	KenBW2	hatter243	and she lives in Finland - that's a long journey from England :D
2009-01-15T03:58:00.000Z	hatter243	KenBW2	do you know if she ever install the ssh package? Ubuntu by default does not support incoming SSH connections
2009-01-15T03:59:00.000Z	KenBW2	hatter243	i got her to istal openssh-server
2009-01-15T03:59:00.000Z	hatter243	KenBW2	so find the model of her router, and figure out how to forward port 22 on it over the TCP protocol
2009-01-15T04:00:00.000Z	KenBW2	hatter243	will do, but tomorrow. it's time i was in bed lol
2009-01-15T04:00:00.000Z	hatter243	KenBW2	hah, good luckl
