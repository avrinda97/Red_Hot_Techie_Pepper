2008-09-21T05:31:00.000Z	belkinhelp2		i have an irritating problem
2008-09-21T05:31:00.000Z	belkinhelp2		i just swapped hard drives
2008-09-21T05:31:00.000Z	belkinhelp2		into a new system
2008-09-21T05:32:00.000Z	belkinhelp2		how can i get ubuntu to KEEP the monitor settings?
2008-09-21T05:32:00.000Z	belkinhelp2		it always reverts back to PnP
2008-09-21T05:33:00.000Z	belkinhelp2		also, the graphic card driver always reverts back to a generic VESA driver
2008-09-21T05:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	Put whatever specific settings you want in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-09-21T05:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	Is the problem just that you aren't getting the correct driver / screen resolution? What is this about two drives?
2008-09-21T05:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	Where are you changing the settings?
2008-09-21T05:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	What version of Ubuntu are you using, screens and graphics doesn't really work very well ( it's not even shown in the most recent version of Ubuntu )
2008-09-21T05:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	Any reason you aren't using 8.04? It may solve your problem
2008-09-21T05:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	What do you mean? Is it the same install just on a different drive? Because that shouldn't make any difference
2008-09-21T05:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	Did you use screens and graphics on your initial install?
2008-09-21T05:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	Use the default ( in fact you can generate a default config no questions asked with "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh )
2008-09-21T05:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	You can't
2008-09-21T06:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	Is that a good thing or a bad thing :) ?
2008-09-21T05:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	Try this quickly, quit dpkg-reconfigure and just run "sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.probably_useless_backup" then restart X, it might just work and it will use all default settings and autodetection from Xorg itself
2008-09-21T05:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	Log out then back in again
2008-09-21T06:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	Don't use screens and graphics, it's more likely to screw things up than do any good
2008-09-21T06:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	You can change the resolution for your specific user ( won't affect login screen ) with System -> Preferences -> Resolution
2008-09-21T06:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	np
2008-09-21T06:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	belkinhelp2	I would grab a hardy liveCD and see how many problems go away with it before doing anything else
