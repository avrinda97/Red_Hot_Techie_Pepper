2007-05-08T06:47:00.000Z	bob111	jhford	atheros
2007-05-08T06:48:00.000Z	jhford	bob111	hmm, have you gone into the restriced driver manager?
2007-05-08T06:59:00.000Z	jhford	bob111	it fixed itself automagically! network manager is an fiddly app
2007-05-08T07:00:00.000Z	jhford	bob111	why?  it is one release
2007-05-08T07:01:00.000Z	jhford	bob111	pidgin is just GAIM 2.0 Beta7
2007-05-08T07:01:00.000Z	jhford	bob111	NOOOOO
2007-05-08T07:02:00.000Z	jhford	bob111	it is horible, don't use any of those crap scripts
2007-05-08T07:02:00.000Z	jhford	bob111	what do you want to use it for
2007-05-08T07:02:00.000Z	jhford	bob111	easy ubunutu is just as bad
2007-05-08T07:02:00.000Z	jhford	bob111	those are simple
2007-05-08T07:03:00.000Z	jhford	bob111	they are garbage.  make sure you have all the repositories enabled in synaptic, then search for flash non-free, sun-java6
2007-05-08T07:04:00.000Z	jhford	bob111	also, install gstreamer0.10 good bad ugly including multiverse versions
2007-05-08T07:04:00.000Z	jhford	bob111	also install the xine/libxine ffmpeg plugin, and get a real media player (VLC/Mplayer)
2007-05-08T07:05:00.000Z	jhford	bob111	mozilla-mplayer
