2010-10-24T03:32:00.000Z	Ghosty	svchost1	whats your Q
2010-10-24T03:33:00.000Z	Ghosty		but as for my question, what packages are required to only run java
2010-10-24T03:33:00.000Z	svchost1	Ghosty	i am trying to install the drivers for this video card, but because i dont have them, the resolution is 800x600 and i cant make it larger. unfortunately, the window for this thing is longer than 800x600 so it runs off the screen
2010-10-24T03:34:00.000Z	Ghosty	svchost1	wow... umm
2010-10-24T03:34:00.000Z	Ghosty	svchost1	can you resize the window?
2010-10-24T03:34:00.000Z	svchost1		no
2010-10-24T03:35:00.000Z	Ghosty	svchost1	if you cant see the window, id suggest using terminal to install your drivers?
2010-10-24T03:35:00.000Z	svchost1		the terminal opens this thing
2010-10-24T03:35:00.000Z	svchost1		so...
2010-10-24T03:35:00.000Z	Ghosty	svchost1	one moment...
2010-10-24T03:36:00.000Z	Ghosty	svchost1	alt+f8 should force a resize, i think
2010-10-24T03:36:00.000Z	Ghosty	svchost1	just select the window
2010-10-24T03:36:00.000Z	svchost1		only forcesa horizontal resize
2010-10-24T03:36:00.000Z	svchost1		not vertical
2010-10-24T03:36:00.000Z	Ghosty		grr
2010-10-24T03:36:00.000Z	Ghosty		oh
2010-10-24T03:37:00.000Z	Ghosty	svchost1	i was gonna say that, lol
2010-10-24T03:37:00.000Z	Ghosty	svchost1	so , select the window, alt+f8, then up/down arrow for verticle resize
