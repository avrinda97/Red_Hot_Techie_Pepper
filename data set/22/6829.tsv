2006-07-18T06:38:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	yuppers
2006-07-18T06:39:00.000Z	easyu	frogzoo	i tried to learn how to setup linux for weeks and made basically no progress during the last two years.
2006-07-18T06:40:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	then maybe the easyubuntu route's what you need to get a usable system to work on
2006-07-18T06:41:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	trouble is, with easyubuntu if you run into probs, it's usually harder to fix
2006-07-18T06:42:00.000Z	easyu	frogzoo	i do not have the permission to write to a partition that was included during the install ...
2006-07-18T06:43:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	if you can't write to it - leave it alone, it's not hurting you
2006-07-18T06:44:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	what's the path?
2006-07-18T06:45:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	& you can't write to it ? o.O ???
2006-07-18T06:45:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	ls -ld /media/sda4
2006-07-18T06:46:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	chown easyu:easyu /dev/sda4
2006-07-18T06:50:00.000Z	easyu	frogzoo	i did: sudo chown easyu:easyu /dev/sda4, but that did not change anything.
2006-07-18T06:50:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	are you logged in as easyu ?
2006-07-18T06:52:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	ls -ld /media/sda4
2006-07-18T06:54:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	thought you chowned it to easyu ?
2006-07-18T06:55:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	chown hope:hope /dev/sda4
2006-07-18T06:55:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	sudo chown hope:hope /dev/sda4          (soz)
2006-07-18T06:57:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	unmount the drive, unplug it & plug it back in again....
2006-07-18T06:58:00.000Z	easyu	frogzoo	sda1 is /
2006-07-18T07:00:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	so what's sda4 doing mounted at /media ?  methinks you should mount this somewhere other than /media
2006-07-18T07:00:00.000Z	easyu	frogzoo	should i change it in fstab ?
2006-07-18T07:06:00.000Z	frogzoo	easyu	yes, edit /etc/fstab
