2011-01-22T05:52:00.000Z	Varc	gnewb	I am new in Linux and i wanna work in it so i am reading  abook and work with Ubuntu for see options
2011-01-22T05:53:00.000Z	gnewb	Varc	That is the way to do it, as always RTM, then read it again, and always make a backup.
2011-01-22T05:54:00.000Z	Varc	gnewb	What is RTM ?
2011-02-09T04:25:00.000Z	gnewb	Varc	You can use the Synaptic Package Manager to search for those.
2011-02-09T04:26:00.000Z	Varc	gnewb	How they will need find?
2011-02-09T04:26:00.000Z	gnewb	Varc	Is it a USB or PCI device?
2011-02-09T04:27:00.000Z	Varc	gnewb	hell men i can't say you because is for a friend and he is not online now
2011-02-09T04:28:00.000Z	gnewb	Varc	Ok, find out which one, then is some terminal calls, ,, one moment..
2011-02-09T04:29:00.000Z	Varc	gnewb	Ok, thanks
2011-02-09T04:30:00.000Z	gnewb	Varc	It is either lspci or lsusb, that will show what the version of it is as installed.
2011-02-09T04:31:00.000Z	gnewb	Varc	After you get an output from that command, you will know what drivers to install.
2011-02-09T04:33:00.000Z	gnewb	Varc	Yes, after getting the correct data from the ls output, then is pretty basic, search ralink in synaptic, but here is the warning, match the output of the lspci/lsusb with the proper available driver and is off to the races.
2011-02-09T04:33:00.000Z	Varc	gnewb	I see, thanks you very much for your help
2011-02-09T04:34:00.000Z	gnewb	Varc	You are very welcome, I just had to do the same thing last week, works fine.
2011-02-09T04:35:00.000Z	Varc	gnewb	Ok, cool my friend will be happy
2011-02-09T04:36:00.000Z	gnewb	Varc	Also look at the Supported Hardware page, just a double check thing to see it that driver is ready or if you need to run the Binary driver.
2011-02-09T04:36:00.000Z	Varc	gnewb	That can be a option, maeby he don't do it
2011-02-09T04:39:00.000Z	gnewb	Varc	Here is that page:> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
