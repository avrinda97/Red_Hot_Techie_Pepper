2007-04-02T13:59:00.000Z	KnowledgEngineer		for update a kernel: apt-get install xxxx ?
2007-04-02T13:59:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	too vague.  what do you mean?
2007-04-02T14:03:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	current ubuntu kernel or new vanilla one?
2007-04-02T14:04:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	sudo apt-get install linux-source
2007-04-02T14:04:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	 then use make-kpkg, see "Master Kernel Thread" on Ubuntu forums for easy instructions.
2007-04-02T14:08:00.000Z	KnowledgEngineer	xtknight	i need this: cp /boot/config-2.6.17-11-generic /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.17/.config
2007-04-02T14:09:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	yea
2007-04-02T14:09:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	if you want current config, that sounds right
2007-04-02T14:09:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	the ngo make menuconfig, set timer Hz, etc...
2007-04-02T14:12:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	sudo make clean?
2007-04-02T14:17:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	maybe you want tickless realtime patches or sometihng
2007-04-02T14:17:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	erm... <what> problem?
2007-04-02T14:18:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	you mean like the one that says 125,250 , 1000 Hz?
2007-04-02T14:23:00.000Z	KnowledgEngineer	xtknight	http://rafb.net/p/PaU1bK89.html
2007-04-02T14:23:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/dialog.h:31:20: error: curses.h: No such file or directory
2007-04-02T14:23:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	follow the 'sudo apt-get' at beginning of 'Master Kernel Thread'. follow all steps
2007-04-02T14:41:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	low latency is not 1000hz
2007-04-02T14:41:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	low latency is another option
2007-04-02T14:58:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	low latency desktop...preemptible kernel
2007-04-02T15:07:00.000Z	KnowledgEngineer	xtknight	i added the support in the configuration file using make menuconfig
2007-04-02T15:08:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	i don't know, dude.  follow the tutorial.  it has everything you need.
2007-04-02T15:09:00.000Z	xtknight	KnowledgEngineer	yes, it does.  it makes a deb which you install.
