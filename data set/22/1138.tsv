2010-09-26T15:20:00.000Z	Sterist	gotwig	so what's the problem lol
2010-09-26T15:21:00.000Z	Sterist	gotwig	are you trying to make a custom ubuntu installation or just some apps?
2010-09-26T15:23:00.000Z	Sterist	gotwig	i just downloaded APTonCD. just install whatever you want to burn, then when you click "create" it will appear on the list
2010-09-26T15:24:00.000Z	Sterist	gotwig	it's an app install cd for ubuntu
2010-09-26T15:25:00.000Z	Sterist	gotwig	now we're going back a few questions :P are you trying to install ubuntu or just apps?
2010-09-26T15:26:00.000Z	Sterist	gotwig	okay then, 1sec
2010-09-26T15:27:00.000Z	Sterist	gotwig	what you need then is Ubuntu Customization Kit
2010-09-26T15:28:00.000Z	Sterist	gotwig	then just do a standard install and then use a APTonCD .... cd
