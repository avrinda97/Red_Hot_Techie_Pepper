2007-09-07T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	xazo	is there a good reason for not using the packages in the repositories?
2007-09-07T05:46:00.000Z	jrib	xazo	evolution-exchange is in the repositories, there's no need to compile it
2007-09-07T05:47:00.000Z	jrib	xazo	just get evolution-exchange and save the compiling step...
2007-09-07T05:48:00.000Z	jrib	xazo	no, you don't need evolution-dev.  All you do is 'sudo apt-get install evolution-exchange' and you are done
2007-09-07T05:50:00.000Z	jrib	xazo	no, the evolution-dev will not install evolution-exchange.
2007-09-07T05:53:00.000Z	jrib	xazo	is there a good reason for compiling 2.10.3 instead of using the version in the repositories?
2007-09-07T05:54:00.000Z	xazo	jrib	when i run apt-get evolution-exchange i get this reply ---> evolution-exchange is already the newest version.
2007-09-07T05:54:00.000Z	jrib	xazo	is there a good reason for compiling 2.10.3 instead of using the version 2.10.1 in the repositories?
2007-09-07T05:56:00.000Z	jrib	xazo	you need to do 'sudo apt-get install build-essential && sudo apt-get build-dep evolution-exchange' and then do the normal ./configure routine (see ubotu's message)
2007-09-07T06:08:00.000Z	xazo	jrib	I just ran the commands to install evolution-exchange; sudo apt-get install build-essential & sudo apt-get build-dep evolution-exchange, ./configure and make and make install.
2007-09-07T06:08:00.000Z	jrib	xazo	ok
2007-09-07T06:08:00.000Z	xazo	jrib	after install, i open evolution and is still version 2.10.1 and not 2.10.3
2007-09-07T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	xazo	were there errors?  You might need to restart or something because I have no idea how evolution-exchange works but it probably stays open in the background
2007-09-07T06:10:00.000Z	xazo	jrib	if it worked, i should be able to open evolution, click on ABOUT and have correct version. yes?
2007-09-07T06:11:00.000Z	jrib	xazo	evolution-exchange probably runs in the background and the old one is still running
2007-09-07T08:21:00.000Z	xazo	jrib	im trying to use a VPN program. I imported a Cisco PFC file, attempt to connect. it fails. I wonder if security on Ubuntu is blocking this VPN connection. Any ideas?
2007-09-07T08:22:00.000Z	jrib	xazo	by default, ubuntu ships with no iptables rules so no ports are blocked
2007-09-07T08:27:00.000Z	xazo	jrib	 I get a connection failed (timeout) error when trying to connect to work using KVpnc. I imported my Cisco PFC file.
2007-09-07T08:27:00.000Z	jrib	xazo	I don't know about that
2007-09-11T10:32:00.000Z	xazo	jrib	do you know of linux program that allows for MS Office to run on linux? I open Wine and select executable but nothing happens. Im thinking WINE isnt my answer. or is it?
2007-09-12T06:20:00.000Z	jrib	xazo	crossover office runs MS office in linux btw
2007-09-12T06:21:00.000Z	jrib	xazo	don't know about 2007
