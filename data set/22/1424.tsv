2010-10-13T00:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dcplaya	if you run: sudo lshw -C network     you can find the chip and search for guides. If you compiled your wifi driver you will need to recompile it against the new driver (for example)
2010-10-13T00:10:00.000Z	dcplaya	ActionParsnip	it worked natively in 10.04 so I did no compiling myself
2010-10-13T00:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dcplaya	then you may need to remove the driver and then reinstall it to make it fly
2010-10-13T00:10:00.000Z	dcplaya	ActionParsnip	how do I remove it?
2010-10-13T00:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dcplaya	well, i have no idea what wireless chip you have. If you tell me I may be able to tell you
2010-10-13T00:12:00.000Z	dcplaya	ActionParsnip	rtl8192SE   realtech
2010-10-13T00:13:00.000Z	dcplaya	ActionParsnip	 it just says "PCI (sysfs)" when i run that command
2010-10-13T00:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dcplaya	wait a whil, it'll say
2010-10-13T00:15:00.000Z	dcplaya	ActionParsnip	 ok it came up,  where does it say the driver in use?
2010-10-13T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dcplaya	read the text, it says
2010-10-13T00:16:00.000Z	dcplaya	ActionParsnip	no driver is listed
2010-10-13T00:18:00.000Z	dcplaya	ActionParsnip	so I dont think a driver is installed. I have tried the driver from realtek website (followed the directions, make then make install then reboot) and still doesnt work
2010-10-13T00:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dcplaya	read the capabilities section
2010-10-13T00:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dcplaya	sudo lshw -C network | grep driver    should show you
2010-10-13T00:21:00.000Z	dcplaya	ActionParsnip	the capabilities line for the wireless says "  capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list"   there is a driver listed for my wired network though
2010-10-13T00:23:00.000Z	dcplaya	ActionParsnip	when i try to make install for the linux drivers from realtek I get an error on it and it doesnt install it seems
2010-10-13T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dcplaya	you may have to install the backport modules
2010-10-13T00:27:00.000Z	dcplaya	ActionParsnip	linux-backports-modules-wireless-maverick-generic  is that the right backport?
2010-10-13T00:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dcplaya	sounds good to me :)
2010-10-13T00:48:00.000Z	dcplaya	ActionParsnip	installing that backport and then make install the wifi drivers still didnt work. still gave an error
