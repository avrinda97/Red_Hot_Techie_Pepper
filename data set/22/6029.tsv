2007-08-28T09:55:00.000Z	sipior	xtknight	bit surprising (i assumed there there was an easy way to do it), but i think your suggestion might be the only option :)
2007-08-28T09:55:00.000Z	xtknight	sipior	i haven't looked very hard
2007-08-28T09:56:00.000Z	sipior	xtknight	nor have i, but it doesn't look like any of the dpkg or apt- tools do this
2007-08-28T09:56:00.000Z	xtknight	sipior	it would probably be one of the developer deb tools
2007-08-28T09:57:00.000Z	sipior	xtknight	apt-listchanges
2007-08-28T09:58:00.000Z	xtknight	sipior	interesing.  crashes on gutsy
2007-08-28T09:58:00.000Z	xtknight	sipior	just apt-listchanges pkgname  right?
2007-08-28T10:00:00.000Z	sipior	xtknight	actually, reading the man page, it appears to do exactly what you suggested for the changelog :)
2007-08-28T10:00:00.000Z	xtknight	sipior	can you get apt-listchanges to work at all?
2007-08-28T10:00:00.000Z	sipior	xtknight	not yet
2007-08-28T10:01:00.000Z	xtknight	sipior	now im not horrible with google or anything but wow i cant find any instructions on how to use this :p
2007-08-28T10:01:00.000Z	sipior	xtknight	i think the status of this program may currently be "b0rked"
2007-08-28T10:02:00.000Z	xtknight	sipior	i'm going to file a bug about this
2007-08-28T10:02:00.000Z	sipior	xtknight	hold off on that
2007-08-28T10:03:00.000Z	sipior	xtknight	i think you need to invoke it on an actual deb package, not the name of the package
2007-08-28T10:03:00.000Z	xtknight	sipior	well if i do this, this is all it says "Reading changelogs... Done" :p
2007-08-28T10:04:00.000Z	sipior	xtknight	yeah, it assumes that you want to see the difference between a package you just grabbed and the one on your system.
2007-08-28T10:04:00.000Z	xtknight	sipior	ok i guess this isnt much use at least for me
2007-08-28T10:04:00.000Z	sipior	xtknight	yeah, sadly
2007-08-28T10:04:00.000Z	xtknight	sipior	wait
2007-08-28T10:04:00.000Z	xtknight	sipior	use the -a switch
2007-08-28T10:04:00.000Z	xtknight	sipior	e.g.  apt-listchanges -va /var/cache/apt/archives/bip_0.6.0-2ubuntu1_amd64.deb
