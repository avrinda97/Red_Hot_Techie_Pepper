2008-03-13T04:06:00.000Z	mindheavy		is there a way to force an unmount?
2008-03-13T04:07:00.000Z	sfears	mindheavy	sudo umount /mounted/folder
2008-03-13T04:07:00.000Z	mindheavy	sfears	its giving me a device busy error, but i cannot find anything i have open accessing the drive
2008-03-13T04:08:00.000Z	sfears	mindheavy	you could always log out to force the unmount.
2008-03-13T04:09:00.000Z	mindheavy	sfears	you know of a way to list what might be keeping this drive busy? all i did was copy a few files to it from a terminal, then closed that terminal and tried unmounting it from the desktop icon
2008-03-13T04:10:00.000Z	sfears		no i don't mindheavy, but i'd like to
2008-03-13T04:10:00.000Z	mindheavy		thanks anyhow, i'll log out i suppose
2008-03-13T04:10:00.000Z	sfears		and i'd imagine there is someway to force the unmount.. but i'm not sure what that is either
2008-03-13T04:10:00.000Z	sfears		hold on mindheavy
2008-03-13T04:10:00.000Z	sfears		let me look something up
2008-03-13T04:10:00.000Z	mindheavy		sure
2008-03-13T04:11:00.000Z	sfears		umount -f
2008-03-13T04:11:00.000Z	sfears		-f     Force unmount (in case of an unreachable NFS system).  (Requires kernel 2.1.116 or later.)
2008-03-13T04:12:00.000Z	sfears		did that work mindheavy?
2008-03-13T04:12:00.000Z	mindheavy	sfears	that command is returning "umount: /media/64MB: device is busy:
2008-03-13T04:13:00.000Z	mindheavy	sfears	even with the force
2008-03-13T04:13:00.000Z	sfears		alright.. hold
2008-03-13T04:18:00.000Z	sfears	mindheavy	try fuser -v /directory/mounted
2008-03-13T04:20:00.000Z	mindheavy	sfears	ah! right after i copied those files, emerald went down, and from that same terminal, i ran 'emerald &'   'fuser' reported emerald when i ran it, maybe if i kill that PID (and possibly emerald again) it'll let me umount
2008-03-13T04:20:00.000Z	sfears		try it out
2008-03-13T04:20:00.000Z	sfears		i think that command tells you what process is using the specified directory
2008-03-13T04:20:00.000Z	mindheavy	sfears	yes, that worked hah, wonder why that command was keeping the drive busy, i thought 'emerald &' would run 'emerald' and exit
