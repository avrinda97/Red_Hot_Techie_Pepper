2009-08-20T09:53:00.000Z	cpu_temp		hi, I want to know whats a safe cpu temperature, mine shows "Thermal 1: ok, 90.0 degrees C"
2009-08-20T09:53:00.000Z	sp_	cpu_temp	that's quite hot
2009-08-20T09:53:00.000Z	sp_	cpu_temp	where did you get that number?
2009-08-20T09:54:00.000Z	cpu_temp	sp_	I do acpi -V
2009-08-20T09:54:00.000Z	cpu_temp	sp_	isnt it suposed to be 60 C ?
2009-08-20T09:54:00.000Z	sp_	cpu_temp	mine is 30ยบ... depends a lot on the cpu
2009-08-20T09:54:00.000Z	sp_		90 is way too hot though
2009-08-20T09:55:00.000Z	cpu_temp	sp_	do you know any other command to check ?
2009-08-20T09:55:00.000Z	cpu_temp	sp_	I am using intel centrino duo, core 2 duo
2009-08-20T09:55:00.000Z	cpu_temp		on Lenovo thinkpad T60
2009-08-20T09:55:00.000Z	sp_	cpu_temp	cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature
2009-08-20T09:56:00.000Z	cpu_temp	sp_	yes it shows 90C for both :(
2009-08-20T09:56:00.000Z	sp_	cpu_temp	are your legs on fire?
2009-08-20T09:57:00.000Z	cpu_temp	sp_	should I try cleaning up the cpu fan ?
2009-08-20T09:57:00.000Z	cpu_temp	sp_	I cleaned it up about a month ago
2009-08-20T09:57:00.000Z	sp_	cpu_temp	your cpu should never run that hot, it's designed to shut down at 70-80ยบ
2009-08-20T09:57:00.000Z	cpu_temp		ok
2009-08-20T09:57:00.000Z	cpu_temp		what do you suggest sp_ ?
2009-08-20T09:57:00.000Z	sp_		but of course, if the fan is acting up, and you're experiencing related issues, cleaning it is a good idea
2009-08-20T09:58:00.000Z	sp_	cpu_temp	is it a laptop?
2009-08-20T09:58:00.000Z	cpu_temp		yes!
2009-08-20T09:58:00.000Z	sp_	cpu_temp	if you can touch the bottom without getting burned, I think it's safe to assume it's not really 90ยบ
