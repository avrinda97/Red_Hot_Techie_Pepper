2011-03-14T10:52:00.000Z	Ant13	larious	branded key?
2011-03-14T10:53:00.000Z	larious	Ant13	EC226
2011-03-14T10:53:00.000Z	Ant13	larious	have you tried from network manager to go on mobile connection after key has been plugged for 5 minutes?
2011-03-14T10:54:00.000Z	larious	Ant13	Yah but it request for APN which my modem can find automatically by win xp
2011-03-14T10:55:00.000Z	Ant13	larious	for apn informations you should either contact your provider or just take a look at their site, what operator are you with?
2011-03-14T10:56:00.000Z	larious	Ant13	 Multilinks telecom Blue broadband
2011-03-14T10:57:00.000Z	Ant13	larious	you should contact them or copy the apn from windwos
2011-03-14T10:59:00.000Z	larious	Ant13	How do I copy from window?
2011-03-14T10:59:00.000Z	Ant13	larious	in the key you re supposed to find an autoconfigurationblabla file, install it , go on key's control panel and get infos about apn, i suggest though to call your operator
2011-03-14T11:01:00.000Z	larious	Ant13	Please you will need to guide me on how to copy that
2011-03-14T11:02:00.000Z	Ant13	larious	since i'm not with your operator it would be hard for me , since most of those configurators are proprietary and vary from operator to operator, you should ask their technical support for more details, unless someone gets u to automatically find it
2011-03-14T11:28:00.000Z	larious	Ant13	is it possible to get the apn by myself cos here they dont know much about linux or apn stuff
2011-03-14T11:28:00.000Z	Ant13	larious	apn doesnt depend on system
2011-03-14T11:29:00.000Z	larious	Ant13	I know but they believe that I want to steal from there network through the apn
2011-03-14T11:30:00.000Z	Ant13	larious	its impossible to do so lol
2011-03-14T11:33:00.000Z	larious	Ant13	I try to install the dashboard of the network and it through wine but wine cant install FILES
2011-03-14T11:34:00.000Z	larious	Ant13	Wine cant install win DLL and Win information files
2011-03-14T11:35:00.000Z	Ant13	larious	im sorry, i dont know much of it, its supposed to work without anything, you should retry with your operator
