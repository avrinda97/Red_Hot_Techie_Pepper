2006-09-08T16:35:00.000Z	frojnd		I am using kubuntu and I got disk whic is NTFS formated
2006-09-08T16:35:00.000Z	frojnd		how can I format it in something that linux likes it
2006-09-08T16:35:00.000Z	frojnd		and it's cheked for linux that works properly
2006-09-08T16:36:00.000Z	SpComb	frojnd	well, you can wipe the partition and put ext3 onto it... do you need to continue using the NTFS partition from windows or keep the data?
2006-09-08T16:37:00.000Z	frojnd	SpComb	no I don't use wins anymore
2006-09-08T16:37:00.000Z	frojnd		I hate them :P

2006-09-08T16:39:00.000Z	SpComb	frojnd	then you can just do "mkfs.ext3 /dev/hd<whateveritis><partition>", that will replace the NTFS partition with ext3, keep in mind that it will also destory all data on that partition
2006-09-08T16:41:00.000Z	frojnd		keep in mind that it will also destory all data on that partition I allready make sure that data can go to***
2006-09-08T16:41:00.000Z	frojnd		:P
2006-09-08T16:48:00.000Z	frojnd	SpComb	what's the difference between fat32 and exte
2006-09-08T16:48:00.000Z	frojnd		beside that ext3 is linux only
2006-09-08T16:50:00.000Z	SpComb	frojnd	uh, I don't know any details, but FAT32 is ancient (win98 anyone?), ext3 is more recent...
2006-09-08T16:51:00.000Z	frojnd		ok..
2006-09-08T16:51:00.000Z	frojnd		let's format it ;)
2006-09-08T16:51:00.000Z	SpComb	frojnd	definatly use ext3 if possible...
2006-09-08T16:51:00.000Z	frojnd		ok..
2006-09-08T16:52:00.000Z	frojnd		so ext3 will cover 400gb of HD ?
2006-09-08T16:52:00.000Z	frojnd		k
2006-09-08T16:52:00.000Z	SpComb	frojnd	ext3 can handle terabytes
