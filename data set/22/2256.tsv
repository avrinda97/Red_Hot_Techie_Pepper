2009-08-05T00:33:00.000Z	RebelZero	Drained	only a 64-bit OS will support 64-bit. If you don't know what your OS is, then you.... nvm... just wasting my time
2009-08-05T00:33:00.000Z	Drained		no Dey0sa: it doesn't, over 70% nividia card users get hardware driver "back end" error:
2009-08-05T00:34:00.000Z	Drained		and we can't use that method.
2009-08-05T00:34:00.000Z	Drained		Rebel: you're wrong,
2009-08-05T00:34:00.000Z	Drained		a x86 processor can run 64bit and a 64bit can run 32bit.
2009-08-05T00:35:00.000Z	RebelZero	Drained	don't worry.. I stopped caring a few minutes ago. Good luck with your issue.
2009-08-05T00:35:00.000Z	Drained		Funny how half you people blurt out answers which lead to useless downloads and useless commands, i'll just go run x64 windows.
2009-08-05T00:36:00.000Z	Drained		lawl, yes it can.

2009-08-05T00:38:00.000Z	Drained		i just dont want to insert it, and then try to install 64bit and it failing. then having to redownload and reburn a x86 version
2009-08-05T00:39:00.000Z	Drained		i've never used it so i don't know, so will it support 64?
2009-08-05T00:39:00.000Z	Drained	edbian	stop blurting out answers. and learn to read properly, i said its not installed/inserted, it's going on my childs custom build.
