2008-02-28T23:27:00.000Z	rrplay	tushyd	i mean pixels   try nvidia-xserver ot nvidia-xsettings
2008-02-28T23:28:00.000Z	rrplay	tushyd	dpkg-reconfigure-xserver
2008-02-28T23:28:00.000Z	rrplay	tushyd	nvidia-settings
2008-02-28T23:30:00.000Z	tushyd	rrplay	nvidia-settings is giving me an error: you do not appear to be running the Nvidia X driver
2008-02-28T23:30:00.000Z	tushyd	rrplay	but if I do nvidia-xconfig and then restart X, it boots into low-res mode
2008-02-28T23:31:00.000Z	rrplay	tushyd	do you get an nvidia logo on boot?
2008-02-28T23:32:00.000Z	rrplay	tushyd	did you reconfigure your x server dpkg-reconfigure-xserver ?
2008-02-28T23:36:00.000Z	tushyd	rrplay	i just did the reconfiguring, should I restart X?
2008-02-28T23:37:00.000Z	tushyd	rrplay	i'll restart X and then come back
