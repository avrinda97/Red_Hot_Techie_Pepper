2007-12-09T04:52:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kitofhawaii	what is the effect on lag and the effect on speed?
2007-12-09T04:51:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	Ashfire908	number of packets the output queue can hold. it helps throttle outbound bandwidth
2007-12-09T04:52:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	Ashfire908	no effect, the queue will empty out as fast as it takes. 1000 packets is normal (same as on a cisco router)
2007-12-09T04:53:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kitofhawaii	but then why does the man file mention lag?
2007-12-09T04:54:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	Ashfire908	well technically it's fifo by default (you can change this but it's not exactly something i'd recommend unless you're using your system as a router)
2007-12-09T04:55:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kitofhawaii	i'm trying to impove my ppp0 connection on my server/gateway.
2007-12-09T04:55:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	Ashfire908	so in fifo you can have contention for bandwidth (aka lag...) weighted fair queue's another option but it takes a bit to set up
2007-12-09T04:56:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kitofhawaii	uh in english?
2007-12-09T04:56:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	Ashfire908	how much bandwidth do you have/how much bandwidth are you trying to use?
2007-12-09T04:57:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kitofhawaii	max speed i have seen is ~17 KB/s
2007-12-09T04:57:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kitofhawaii	wvdial/ifup sets it by default at 3.
2007-12-09T04:58:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	Ashfire908	eh for dialup hmm yah i can't really think of much that'd improve lag
2007-12-09T04:59:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kitofhawaii	ok then
2007-12-09T04:59:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	Ashfire908	(assuming it's dialup, or is it DSL?)
2007-12-09T05:00:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	Ashfire908	are you using PPP as in dialup, or PPP as in broadband?
2007-12-09T05:00:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kitofhawaii	it's a dialup connection via a cell phone in "high-speed" data packet mode
2007-12-09T05:00:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kitofhawaii	dialup
2007-12-09T05:01:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kitofhawaii	gtg eat
2007-12-09T05:01:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	Ashfire908	17.8KB/sec's pretty fast for cell phone. that's 144kbps.  i think most cell phone dialups top out at ~168kbps
2007-12-09T05:02:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kitofhawaii	i said ~17 KB/s. it's usally in the 16 KB/s range. if it gets to 17, it's like 17.0 or 17.1.
2007-12-09T05:03:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kitofhawaii	ok gtg.
2007-12-09T05:03:00.000Z	kitofhawaii	Ashfire908	that's pretty typical. i think you're maxing out, if you want faster you have to go to EDGE or another high speed cell connection (ttyl have fun)
