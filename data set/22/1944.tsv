2009-11-14T01:52:00.000Z	IrssiNoMerci		saji:sudo -s = it literally means "sudo to a shell as specified by SHELL enviro-variable" ; the -i means "Initial shell" as per the passwd file shell field entry
2009-11-14T01:53:00.000Z	saji	IrssiNoMerci	Thanks... Can you help with my mounting problem of NTFS partition?
2009-11-14T01:54:00.000Z	IrssiNoMerci	saji	for example, if i really want to sudo into a root csh, I could set the envirovariable SHELL to csh then sudo into it with sudo -s
2009-11-14T01:54:00.000Z	IrssiNoMerci	saji	whereas just using sudo -i would give me my normal initial shell (bash on this machine)
2009-11-14T01:56:00.000Z	saji	IrssiNoMerci	Can u please help me to solve a problem i have in mounting?
2009-11-14T01:56:00.000Z	IrssiNoMerci	saji	just ask i have to eat soon but other may jump in to help, go ahead
2009-11-14T02:00:00.000Z	saji	IrssiNoMerci	I was copying a file to my NTFS partitions, then my laptop's battery was over, it got powered off... Now I'm unable to mount that partition as any user except root....
2009-11-14T02:00:00.000Z	IrssiNoMerci	saji	ok, sometimes a NTFS filseystemgets marked as "dirty" due to a incomplete unmount
2009-11-14T02:01:00.000Z	IrssiNoMerci	saji	were u using NTFS-3G to mount the f/s ?
2009-11-14T02:02:00.000Z	saji	IrssiNoMerci	How can I know that? I just click the partition in NAutilus, and it gets mounted.. No idea about the internals...
2009-11-14T02:02:00.000Z	IrssiNoMerci	saji	ok thats the NTFS-3G way then I think
2009-11-14T02:02:00.000Z	IrssiNoMerci	saji	via fuse etc , 1 minute please
2009-11-14T02:02:00.000Z	saji	IrssiNoMerci	ok...
2009-11-14T02:03:00.000Z	IrssiNoMerci	saji	do you have Micro$oft Windows on the amchine as well? can you boot into windows and check the drive that way?
2009-11-14T02:04:00.000Z	saji	IrssiNoMerci	I'm able to mount the partition as root, in Ubuntu itself, and it works fine in Windows Vista too...
2009-11-14T02:06:00.000Z	IrssiNoMerci	saji	OK, i'd recommend running the Vista diskcheck, is it checkdisk? maybe? , just becasue you shut down uncleanly. its a Miscor$oft f/s, so they know the real secrets :)
2009-11-14T02:06:00.000Z	saji	IrssiNoMerci	So no Ubuntu way to do things??
2009-11-14T02:07:00.000Z	IrssiNoMerci	saji	are you sure its not just asking for "sudo" style authentication to mount the f/s? I dont run NTFS you see, but I ythink maybe it likes you to be n admin user....perhaps
2009-11-14T02:07:00.000Z	IrssiNoMerci	saji	but like i said, if it shut down uncleanly best be safe and check under windoze
2009-11-14T02:08:00.000Z	IrssiNoMerci	saji	well, not really, you _can_ force the "dirty-bit" to be unchecked, but thats risky in theory
2009-11-14T02:10:00.000Z	IrssiNoMerci	saji	although NTFS is way better than the FAT f/systems, it's not what I'd call "robust" compared to things like UFS, ZFS, ext3/4 etc
2009-11-14T02:12:00.000Z	saji	IrssiNoMerci	main plus of NTFS to FAt is the security aspect....
