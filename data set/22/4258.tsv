2008-02-11T08:12:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		ok I've lost my sound, I updated System76, rebooted, nothing is working. I tried going into update manager and package manager, i get this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/55563/plain/
2008-02-11T08:13:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		then I just realized I blindly followed forum posts and got the system76 driver, and I don't have a system76
2008-02-11T08:13:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		so... first step IO'd like to take is removing that system76 update haha
2008-02-11T08:13:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		i've been searching the forums and trying to fix this for hours
2008-02-11T08:14:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		i updated Alsa and now my soundcard isn't being read at all
2008-02-11T08:14:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		!killupdatemanager
2008-02-11T08:15:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		anyway, so how do I get my signatures verified
2008-02-11T08:16:00.000Z	visualdeception	ahorriblemess	another option is install htop...then find the update manager
2008-02-11T08:16:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		htop?
2008-02-11T08:16:00.000Z	visualdeception	ahorriblemess	yes, do sudo aptitude install htop
2008-02-11T08:16:00.000Z	visualdeception		runs in command line
2008-02-11T08:16:00.000Z	visualdeception		very nice
2008-02-11T08:17:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	visualdeception	ok I did that... what did that do?
2008-02-11T08:17:00.000Z	visualdeception		ahor
2008-02-11T08:17:00.000Z	visualdeception	ahorriblemess	now type in htop
2008-02-11T08:17:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		ok
2008-02-11T08:17:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		did that
2008-02-11T08:17:00.000Z	visualdeception	ahorriblemess	and search for the update manager, click f9 and kill
2008-02-11T08:17:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		what does that do exactly
2008-02-11T08:18:00.000Z	visualdeception		basically runs the same command that was told above....only sort of graphically...if you call it that
2008-02-11T08:19:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	visualdeception	I searched and it's not there
2008-02-11T08:19:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	visualdeception	oh wait there's "update-notifier" is that it?
