2005-04-25T15:19:00.000Z	WeirdAl		Filesystem question
2005-04-25T15:19:00.000Z	WeirdAl		I have a partition mounted to /wine
2005-04-25T15:20:00.000Z	WeirdAl		What do I put in fstab so that users can write to /wine?
2005-04-25T15:20:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	I think set the gid in the options to a common group, and set a umask that gives group write permission (or open it to the world)
2005-04-25T15:35:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	users just lets users mount it. look at the uid/gid/umask options
2005-04-25T15:36:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	uid and gid are the user and group (numeric IDs, found in /etc/passwd and /etc/group) that will own the file system
2005-04-25T15:37:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	the umask will set the permission bits
2005-04-25T15:40:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	yeah
2005-04-25T15:42:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	I suspect, however, that group 1000 is the private group created for your account, so you might consider using the 'users' group or, creating a wine group, and adding everyone who gets to write to the /wine partition to that group
2005-04-25T15:43:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	ok. you probably don't need to mess with umask, then. why not just run wine out of you home directory in that case?
2005-04-25T15:44:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	ah
2005-04-25T15:44:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	start with 007 and play around until it's right
2005-04-25T15:49:00.000Z	WeirdAl	jgeorgeson	I set it uid=1000,gid=1000 and it's still mounted as root/root
2005-04-25T15:50:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	did you umount after editing /etc/fstab?
2005-04-25T15:52:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	I'm not sure ext2 supports uid/gid. for some reason I assumed vfat
2005-04-25T15:54:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	files under /wine are owned by root, or /wine itself?
2005-04-25T15:54:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	what if you create a file under /wine?
2005-04-25T15:55:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	ok, you and webtoe are going to love this, instead of uid/gid, give the users option and mount it as yourself rather than as root
2005-04-25T15:59:00.000Z	WeirdAl	jgeorgeson	guess what?
2005-04-26T16:02:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	so you umount /wine, edit fstab to have defaults,users, mount as yourself, and it's all owned as root?
2005-04-26T16:02:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	WeirdAl	chown syntax looks fine
