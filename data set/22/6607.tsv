2006-10-11T13:56:00.000Z	es1		how valuable did you say your data was?
2006-10-11T13:57:00.000Z	es1		What's the cost of losing it?
2006-10-11T13:57:00.000Z	es1		Okay, not trying to be a pain, only trying to understand.  Then why do the conversion?  I missed that part.
2006-10-11T13:58:00.000Z	es1		I understand them
2006-10-11T13:58:00.000Z	es1		then
2006-10-11T13:59:00.000Z	es1		unfortunately, anon32, you are stuck with a bunch of bad solutions.
2006-10-11T13:59:00.000Z	es1		I'm really sorry because I truly understand where you are at because I've been there
2006-10-11T13:59:00.000Z	es1		yes they are.
2006-10-11T13:59:00.000Z	es1		Best of luck
2006-10-11T14:00:00.000Z	es1		crimagdk: fsck is never fast
2006-10-11T14:00:00.000Z	CromagDK	es1	hmm ok
2006-10-11T14:00:00.000Z	es1		you may be seeing journaling kicking in
2006-10-11T14:01:00.000Z	CromagDK	es1	nothing no.
2006-10-11T14:01:00.000Z	es1	anon32	don't know yet.  Haven't tried it
2006-10-11T14:01:00.000Z	CromagDK	es1	just fsck /dev/sda2 and 1 sec after it tells me its clean
2006-10-11T14:01:00.000Z	es1		you might also try jfs
2006-10-11T14:01:00.000Z	es1		Cromagdk: all that problem.  It's just checking the clean flag
2006-10-11T14:02:00.000Z	es1		you need to force it to do an fsck sometime.  These switches are in the man page
2006-10-11T14:02:00.000Z	CromagDK	es1	oh ok. so what can i do to check the disc more ?
2006-10-11T14:02:00.000Z	CromagDK		floppy disk ?
2006-10-11T14:02:00.000Z	es1		bad blocks
2006-10-11T14:02:00.000Z	CromagDK	es1	ah ye thnkix
