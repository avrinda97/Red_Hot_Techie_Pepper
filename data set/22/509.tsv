2011-08-15T18:35:00.000Z	ThePendulum		Hey. I've got a problem. Everytime my PC returns from Suspend, my internet connection isn't working. I've tried disconnecting/reconnecting, and to disable/enable networking. The only thing that seems to work is to physically plug in/out my internet cable
2011-08-15T18:36:00.000Z	thunsucker	ThePendulum	what version of ubuntu do you have
2011-08-15T18:36:00.000Z	ThePendulum	thunsucker	11.04
2011-08-15T18:36:00.000Z	thunsucker	ThePendulum	hmmm i know that 10.04 had a lot of issues with that
2011-08-15T18:37:00.000Z	ThePendulum	thunsucker	I guess they haven't been solved in 11.04 yet :O Or I'm just doing something incredibly wrong
2011-08-15T18:38:00.000Z	thunsucker	ThePendulum	jus ta moment let me look around, is it a desktop or laptop?
2011-08-15T18:38:00.000Z	ThePendulum	thunsucker	It's a desktop. It's a physical connection, not wi-fi
2011-08-15T18:40:00.000Z	thunsucker	ThePendulum	found a thread that is new that talks about your problem, sounds like they made a change to the way acpi handles networking on suspend: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1777685
2011-08-15T18:40:00.000Z	ThePendulum	thunsucker	I had weird issues during installation as well. At the timezone window, the installation would freeze unless I would install it without internet connection.
2011-08-15T18:40:00.000Z	ThePendulum	thunsucker	Does the thread solve the issue as well?
2011-08-15T18:40:00.000Z	thunsucker	ThePendulum	is your nic a broadcom? they haven't posted back but it sounds like a valid resolution
2011-08-15T18:42:00.000Z	ThePendulum	thunsucker	My network card is built into the motherboard. Allow me a minute to find out more details about it
2011-08-15T18:42:00.000Z	thunsucker	ThePendulum	if i had to guess i would say it's a broadcom
2011-08-15T18:42:00.000Z	ThePendulum	thunsucker	I never heard of broadcom before regarding my PC, so I doubt it
2011-08-15T18:43:00.000Z	thunsucker	ThePendulum	give that link a try, it's modern and it seems there is an off and on option, try both to see what happens
2011-08-15T18:44:00.000Z	ThePendulum	thunsucker	Would you mind directing me to the actual link? Thanks :p
2011-08-15T18:44:00.000Z	ThePendulum	thunsucker	A found it, I missed it. Sorry!

2011-08-15T18:45:00.000Z	thunsucker	ThePendulum	all good
2011-08-15T18:46:00.000Z	ThePendulum	thunsucker	The thread seems to deal with wireless connections that become invisible. I am using a physical cable connection, and it's visible after suspend, but it just won't connect
2011-08-15T18:47:00.000Z	thunsucker	ThePendulum	the same principle applies. wireless will acti differently with the same problem vs wired. The thread is about acpi suspending the networking and freezing or not becoming available. therefore it should still apply
2011-08-15T18:48:00.000Z	ThePendulum	thunsucker	I'll have another look at it. Thank you for reminding me of the word 'wired' by the way. And thank you for your support! :)
