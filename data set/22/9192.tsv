2005-03-19T09:46:00.000Z	quarupt		has anyone in here ever used the real vnc java applet from a web browser to connect to there box via vino?
2005-03-19T09:48:00.000Z	prego	quarupt	shouldn't be a problem
2005-03-19T09:49:00.000Z	quarupt	prego	well i didnt know if it was feature of just realvnc or vino as well
2005-03-19T09:50:00.000Z	quarupt	prego	cause i cant seem to get it working, then again, i dont have the firefox java plugin installed yet eitther, cant remeber how
2005-03-19T09:52:00.000Z	quarupt	prego	all i get when i try to connect is RFB 003.007
2005-03-19T09:54:00.000Z	quarupt	prego	so can ya help?
2005-03-19T09:55:00.000Z	prego	quarupt	all I can say is that I've used vino with other machine vncvieiwer... and I didn't have a problem eventhough vncviewer I used is quite old (at a RH7.3 machine)
2005-03-19T09:56:00.000Z	quarupt	prego	no im trying to use the java applet via a browser to connect, it uses something different i think
2005-03-19T09:56:00.000Z	prego	quarupt	I tried java applet long time ago and didn't require anything special as far as I recall...
2005-03-19T09:57:00.000Z	prego	quarupt	except of java, obviously
2005-03-19T09:57:00.000Z	prego	quarupt	however it was slower compared to standalone vncviewer
2005-03-19T10:01:00.000Z	prego	quarupt	you are right, it doesn't work
2005-03-19T10:01:00.000Z	prego	quarupt	probably vino does not offer the java applet
2005-03-19T10:02:00.000Z	prego	quarupt	You are right again, I'm sorry
2005-03-19T10:02:00.000Z	prego	quarupt	"normal" vncserver should be enough
2005-03-19T10:03:00.000Z	prego	quarupt	vncserver is not at ubuntu packages?
2005-03-19T10:04:00.000Z	prego	quarupt	btw, I'm getting same message for vncserver
2005-03-19T10:05:00.000Z	quarupt	prego	ok thx
2005-03-19T10:05:00.000Z	prego	quarupt	perhaps there is some configuration option for that
2005-03-19T10:08:00.000Z	quarupt	prego	but where, i could never find a conf for vino
2005-03-19T10:11:00.000Z	prego	quarupt	I don't know if vino depends on vncserver; if such, probably it is matter of vncserver configuration...
2005-03-19T10:12:00.000Z	prego	quarupt	nope, vino seems to be independent from vncserver
