2008-05-24T08:17:00.000Z	Wangberg		does anyone know if you can backup or save pidgin user logs ?
2008-05-24T08:17:00.000Z	Wangberg		well, i'm installing a new distro
2008-05-24T08:18:00.000Z	Wangberg		but i just wanted to back them up and keep them for records
2008-05-24T08:18:00.000Z	Wangberg		garrett: how ?
2008-05-24T08:19:00.000Z	Wangberg		i can't access them in that format
2008-05-24T08:19:00.000Z	Wangberg		i would have to go throuh and copy/paste text
2008-05-24T08:19:00.000Z	Wangberg		i don't want to do that
2008-05-24T08:19:00.000Z	garrett__	Wangberg	uh... what?
2008-05-24T08:17:00.000Z	garrett__	Wangberg	pidgin has native support for conversation logs, no?
2008-05-24T08:17:00.000Z	garrett__	Wangberg	or do you mean once it's logged, some way to automatically back it up?
2008-05-24T08:18:00.000Z	garrett__	Wangberg	just upload them somewhere
2008-05-24T08:19:00.000Z	garrett__	Wangberg	well, you could, for example, make a .tar file of them or a .zip or whatever and upload them to divshare?
2008-05-24T08:19:00.000Z	garrett__	Wangberg	or you could burn them to cd?
2008-05-24T08:19:00.000Z	garrett__	Wangberg	your logs are stored as text files
2008-05-24T08:20:00.000Z	garrett__	Wangberg	wait.. what?
2008-05-24T08:20:00.000Z	garrett__	Wangberg	they're not logged anywhere if you aven't enabled logging
2008-05-24T08:20:00.000Z	garrett__	Wangberg	no, this is why you ate yourself
2008-05-24T08:20:00.000Z	garrett__	Wangberg	check your homedir
2008-05-24T08:21:00.000Z	garrett__	Wangberg	look in your ~/.purple directory.  find what you want.  make an archive of it.  upload tat somewhere.
2008-05-24T08:23:00.000Z	garrett__	Wangberg	and just as a heads up, think through what you ask a little bit.  like, imagine you were writing a quick email to someone and you wanted to give tem all the facts so they could work from that
2008-05-24T08:23:00.000Z	garrett__	Wangberg	it helps prevent miscommuncations and frustration
2008-05-24T08:24:00.000Z	garrett__	Wangberg	"where does gaim store log files" would have been a better question
