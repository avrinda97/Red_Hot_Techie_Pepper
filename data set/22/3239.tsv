2011-03-25T19:10:00.000Z	ruan	Kalisto	hmmmm
2011-03-25T19:10:00.000Z	ruan	Kalisto	try it through gedit now

2011-03-25T19:15:00.000Z	Kalisto	ruan	ok after edit of sources.list and then update i get: GPG error: http://ppa.launchpad.net maverick Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key
2011-03-25T19:18:00.000Z	ruan	Kalisto	hmmm
2011-03-25T19:24:00.000Z	ruan	Kalisto	that might have been the reason all other methods failed
2011-03-25T19:24:00.000Z	ruan	Kalisto	glad that it's working now though
2011-03-25T19:25:00.000Z	Kalisto	ruan	yea and lucky i know my way around ubuntu a bit. hope that does not happen to any new users.
