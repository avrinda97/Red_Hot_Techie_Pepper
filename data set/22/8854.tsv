2009-08-16T05:07:00.000Z	GuidMorrow		WTH! :"Error: Conflicts with the installed package 'virtualbox-ose'"
2009-08-16T05:07:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	GuidMorrow	You can only have one edition of VirtualBox installed at a time, either OSE or the commercial closed-source version.
2009-08-16T05:07:00.000Z	GuidMorrow		!
2009-08-16T05:09:00.000Z	GuidMorrow		crap, what will this do to my virtual disk image?!
2009-08-16T05:09:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	GuidMorrow	I hit the same thing, all I did was uninstall the OSE and install the closed source one
2009-08-16T05:09:00.000Z	Q_Continuum		I didn't do a purge or anything
2009-08-16T05:09:00.000Z	Q_Continuum		and it kept (and used) the same config file(s)
2009-08-16T05:10:00.000Z	GuidMorrow		but what about the vdi
2009-08-16T05:13:00.000Z	GuidMorrow		...
2009-08-16T05:13:00.000Z	GuidMorrow		now I can't find it, where's the program?!
2009-08-16T05:13:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	GuidMorrow	VDI?  Should be fine.  Those are under .VirtualBox
2009-08-16T05:14:00.000Z	Q_Continuum		The commercial version doesn't make a shortcut.
2009-08-16T05:14:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	GuidMorrow	I created a shortcut on the top bar, command is... VirtualBox
2009-08-16T05:14:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	GuidMorrow	Also, #vbox - join it.  That's the channel for Virtual Box :-D
2009-08-16T05:24:00.000Z	GuidMorrow		well those guys are certainly no help, they're thinking WIndoze

2009-08-16T05:35:00.000Z	GuidMorrow		why did "virtualbox-3.0" appear in the computer janitor? something's wrong with the package
2009-08-16T05:36:00.000Z	GuidMorrow		!janitor
2009-08-16T05:37:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	GuidMorrow	I just have a shortcut set to run 'VirtualBox' and that works.
