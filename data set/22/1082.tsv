2012-03-18T05:53:00.000Z	BLZbubba_		ok what does it take to get ubuntu to leave resolv.conf alone?  is it possible to just dpkg -r resolv.conf?
2012-03-18T05:54:00.000Z	BLZbubba_		or will the upstart house of cards come crashing down on that too
2012-03-18T05:55:00.000Z	BLZbubba_		you don't have a choice
2012-03-18T05:55:00.000Z	BLZbubba_		it is there by default and overwrites resolv.conf
2012-03-18T05:55:00.000Z	BLZbubba_		the only thing worse than resolvconf is Network Manager
2012-03-18T05:56:00.000Z	BLZbubba_		how about /etc/network/interfaces and resolv.conf and that should be it; is there a way to set it up that way?
2012-03-18T05:56:00.000Z	BLZbubba_		and systemd instead of #$^ upstart
2012-03-18T05:56:00.000Z	BLZbubba_		on precise, it doesn't look like i have network manager installed
2012-03-18T05:56:00.000Z	scientes	BLZbubba_	agreed
2012-03-18T05:57:00.000Z	scientes	BLZbubba_	oh woah, you having trouble with dnsmasq?
2012-03-18T05:57:00.000Z	scientes	BLZbubba_	you can turn that off (i did)
2012-03-18T05:58:00.000Z	BLZbubba_	scientes	no i think it is resolv.conf, it made some retarded symlink to /run/resolvconf.  l4me
2012-03-18T05:58:00.000Z	scientes	BLZbubba_	but it works
2012-03-18T05:59:00.000Z	BLZbubba_	scientes	the symlink doesn't work for crap.  dnsmasq isn't installed either
2012-03-18T05:59:00.000Z	scientes	BLZbubba_	dnsmasq IS installed, just not the dnsmasq package
2012-03-18T05:59:00.000Z	scientes	BLZbubba_	but 100% agreed on the systemd thing
2012-03-18T06:00:00.000Z	scientes	BLZbubba_	why don't you just use debian, that has systemd
2012-03-18T06:01:00.000Z	BLZbubba_	scientes	i usually do but when new LTS releases come out i'll give them another try
2012-03-18T06:02:00.000Z	scientes	BLZbubba_	ubuntu LTS always have buggy and old universe packages
2012-03-18T06:02:00.000Z	scientes	BLZbubba_	which is just an import from debian testing
2012-03-18T06:02:00.000Z	scientes	BLZbubba_	and you can always use a newer kernel package from unstable
2012-03-18T06:03:00.000Z	BLZbubba_	scientes	yeah i use debian for "real" servers but i have a set of mythbuntu machines
