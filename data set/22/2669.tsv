2009-04-10T04:05:00.000Z	Rangoe		can someone please give me some hints on grub4dos
2009-04-10T04:06:00.000Z	DasEi	Rangoe	what do you want to achieve ?
2009-04-10T04:09:00.000Z	DasEi	Rangoe	do the other options work ?
2009-04-10T04:10:00.000Z	Rangoe	DasEi	none work
2009-04-10T04:10:00.000Z	Rangoe	DasEi	im kinda desperate on this, i dont understand where did grub4dos came from or why does it show those 3 options it doesnt make any sense
2009-04-10T04:11:00.000Z	DasEi	Rangoe	it sounds like there is a grub installed that doesn't boot anymore; do you kow if there was a linux on before ?
2009-04-10T04:12:00.000Z	Rangoe	DasEi	im not sure it could be.. i didnt install it myself. What would you normally do in order to fix the boot
2009-04-10T04:13:00.000Z	Rangoe	DasEi	i would try an 2003 repair install but it doesnt boot from cd, only cd that boots is the one from hp which only allows me to do a clean install
2009-04-10T04:18:00.000Z	DasEi	Rangoe	that's bad, no live-cd bootable .. can you acces the drive in another way (f.e. hang the hd in a working pc ?) ?
2009-04-10T04:19:00.000Z	Rangoe	DasEi	yea thats another issue.. the 5 hds are ~SAS which means i cant connect em to a sata (no cables)
2009-04-10T04:20:00.000Z	DasEi	Rangoe	but you say the hp disk boots.., which other boot-cd's did you try ?
2009-04-10T04:21:00.000Z	Rangoe	DasEi	only the hp one, i tried the 2003 server bootable cd on my home computer and its bootable and workin
2009-04-10T04:25:00.000Z	Rangoe	DasEi	that server is working as a dhcp server / domain server, all the ppl that work in the company saved their files in there. i guess it would be used for business
2009-04-10T04:27:00.000Z	Rangoe	DasEi	is grub4dos similar to partition magic as a software?
2009-04-10T04:27:00.000Z	Rangoe	DasEi	oki tks
2009-04-10T04:28:00.000Z	DasEi	Rangoe	also checkout #grub
2009-04-10T04:28:00.000Z	Rangoe	DasEi	yea im in there asking but no do atm
2009-04-10T04:28:00.000Z	DasEi	Rangoe	case it's a pure windows install: #windows
2009-04-10T04:29:00.000Z	Rangoe	DasEi	ty so much for all the hints brb
2009-04-10T04:29:00.000Z	DasEi	Rangoe	so first try to get a live cd to boot, as you can't acces the pc in another way
2009-04-10T04:29:00.000Z	DasEi	Rangoe	cu
2009-04-10T04:29:00.000Z	Rangoe	DasEi	ok will do
