2012-09-11T23:43:00.000Z	Pazzie		i can stream everything with the best quality and the ps3 have dts-hd support and 3d support same as my reciever and tv
2012-09-11T23:44:00.000Z	Pazzie		and the ps3 is the only console who support those things
2012-09-11T23:45:00.000Z	Troy^		i had problems with cinavia and other encoding bullcrap. with my HTPC and my ubuntu server it's perfect.
2012-09-11T23:46:00.000Z	Pazzie		but Troy^  i bought also new network cables and i have everything wired (except my laptop) and that change allot i my internal network speed, after that everyting was perfect, the best quality, and no more hickups
2012-09-11T23:47:00.000Z	Pazzie		1080P DTS-HD no problem
2012-09-11T23:47:00.000Z	Troy^		yea i can do it over 802.11n with my HTPC though..
2012-09-11T23:48:00.000Z	Pazzie		okay, well i dont use wireless for streaming so i dont have that challence ;)
2012-09-11T23:48:00.000Z	Troy^		yea ps3 is only 802.11g which really is a big downfall of the ps3
2012-09-11T23:49:00.000Z	Pazzie		i have another question, what size do you recommend for the OS disk? 10GB?
2012-09-11T23:49:00.000Z	Pazzie		more or less?
2012-09-11T23:49:00.000Z	Troy^		10gb is pretty small is your /home/ going to be on there as well?
2012-09-11T23:50:00.000Z	Pazzie		yes (i must say i am new to linux)
2012-09-11T23:50:00.000Z	Pazzie		i am a windows server guy normaly
2012-09-11T23:50:00.000Z	Troy^	Pazzie	this is for a desktop correct? I would definietly allocated double that to an install of ubuntu
2012-09-11T23:50:00.000Z	Pazzie	Troy^	no its for ubuntu server
2012-09-11T23:51:00.000Z	Troy^	Pazzie	10gb is fine then really..
