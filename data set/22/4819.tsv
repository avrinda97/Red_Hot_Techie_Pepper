2011-10-16T03:15:00.000Z	Fishscene	deebee	The network in 11.10 crashes at random, a filesystem check is triggered every time I boot, and I can NOT get in remotely with SSH, despite removing IPTables and not having ufw installed.
2011-10-16T03:18:00.000Z	deebee	Fishscene	and this is all on Ubuntu within a VM?
2011-10-16T03:18:00.000Z	Fishscene	deebee	Yes.
2011-10-16T03:18:00.000Z	deebee	Fishscene	had it been working previously, or is it a fresh install that's always been broken?
2011-10-16T03:21:00.000Z	deebee	Fishscene	so what's your priority? Getting ssh access working?
2011-10-16T03:22:00.000Z	Fishscene	deebee	Priority 1: get ssh working so I can SFTP in and grab data off.
2011-10-16T03:22:00.000Z	deebee	Fishscene	Ok, have you done any network troubleshooting? E.g, pinging the VM?
2011-10-16T03:23:00.000Z	deebee	Fishscene	or pinging hosts from within the VM
2011-10-16T03:23:00.000Z	Fishscene	deebee	Good question. Seems I can't ping from the VM to anywhere.
2011-10-16T03:23:00.000Z	deebee	Fishscene	can you pastebin the output of ifconfig?
2011-10-16T03:24:00.000Z	deebee	Fishscene	ok
2011-10-16T03:24:00.000Z	Fishscene	deebee	I only have a local adapter. No network adapter
2011-10-16T03:24:00.000Z	deebee	Fishscene	ok, well revert the VM and let me know what happens
2011-10-16T03:24:00.000Z	deebee	Fishscene	I'm guessing you don't have a snapshot pre-upgrade anymore? :)
2011-10-16T03:25:00.000Z	Fishscene	deebee	If I can get my files off, I can revert to pre-upgrade
2011-10-16T03:25:00.000Z	Fishscene	deebee	Retrieving files now  \:D/
2011-10-16T03:26:00.000Z	deebee	Fishscene	glad it's working for you :)
2011-10-16T03:26:00.000Z	Fishscene	deebee	Sometimes I need someone to slap me into "think through" mode. Thanks!
2011-10-16T03:26:00.000Z	deebee	Fishscene	you can actually mount VMware disk images to read files from them in a lot of situations. Worth knowing for the future if you didn't already
2011-10-16T03:26:00.000Z	deebee	Fishscene	we all do it from time to time :)
2011-10-16T03:27:00.000Z	Fishscene	deebee	Also, I discovered I can have multiple snapshots now, so when I said I had committed the VM, I thought I was overwriting my old snapshots.
2011-10-16T03:27:00.000Z	deebee	Fishscene	snapshots are your friend, especially when it comes to major system changes :)
