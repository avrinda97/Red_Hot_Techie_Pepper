2008-07-20T12:35:00.000Z	MooCow		ok /home/michael/Desktop/newbloot/trunk/infobot trunk is the directory infobot is the app
2008-07-20T12:37:00.000Z	MooCow		ok
2008-07-20T12:38:00.000Z	MooCow		i usually use ./infobot when im in the directory to launch the app
2008-07-20T12:38:00.000Z	MooCow		but i need to do all of this in one swoop
2008-07-20T12:40:00.000Z	MooCow		gimme the code to run gui sudo nautliss
2008-07-20T12:41:00.000Z	MooCow		yep thanks
2008-07-20T12:41:00.000Z	MooCow		you know the very base directory, /?
2008-07-20T12:42:00.000Z	MooCow		Is it ok to put stuff there?
2008-07-20T12:42:00.000Z	MooCow		or will the computer implode?
2008-07-20T12:42:00.000Z	wols	MooCow	don't
2008-07-20T12:44:00.000Z	wols	MooCow	you don't want to have infobot file in / at all
2008-07-20T12:45:00.000Z	wols	MooCow	copy the infobot to /usr/local/bin  and you can run it from everywhere
2008-07-20T12:46:00.000Z	wols	MooCow	that won't help with launching at startup btw
2008-07-20T12:50:00.000Z	wols	MooCow	do what Flannel just told you
2008-07-20T13:00:00.000Z	wols	MooCow	you've been told time and again. this won't change
2008-07-20T13:01:00.000Z	wols	MooCow	/etc/rc.local
2008-07-20T13:17:00.000Z	wols	MooCow	where on your disk is that infobot script?
2008-07-20T13:17:00.000Z	wols	MooCow	tell us the complete path for the file
2008-07-20T13:19:00.000Z	wols	MooCow	cd /;/home/michael/desktop/newbloot/trunk/infobot
2008-07-20T13:20:00.000Z	wols	MooCow	answer me. what does the command I gave you produce?
2008-07-20T13:22:00.000Z	wols	MooCow	that is what happens whenyou put it into /etc/rc.local too
