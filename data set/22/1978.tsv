2009-12-23T06:53:00.000Z	scott_ino2	jolaren	are you trying to use a stable build or a more recent one
2009-12-23T06:54:00.000Z	scott_ino2	jolaren	what hardware are you using for this?
2009-12-23T06:55:00.000Z	scott_ino2	jolaren	if it's new it's possible it just doesn't like your hardware

2009-12-23T07:00:00.000Z	scott_ino2	jolaren	i don't know if it's specific, just know the guide I followed told me to get a certain one that had the ION drivers in it.....
