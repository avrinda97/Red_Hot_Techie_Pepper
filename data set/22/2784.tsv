2009-04-20T09:22:00.000Z	xangua	sheena1	you can use FEBE to back up bookmarks, prefs, history, passwords, etc
2009-04-20T09:22:00.000Z	sheena1	xangua	thanks, i'll try and find that
2009-04-20T09:23:00.000Z	xangua	sheena1	FEBE + CLEO to backup addons and themes in a sinble xpi file
2009-04-20T09:25:00.000Z	sheena1	xangua	no themes, so no worries there. thanks so much for the resource!
2009-04-20T10:02:00.000Z	sheena1	xangua	i think that is what i just did tonight ?
2009-04-20T09:53:00.000Z	xangua	sheena1	what is your problem with youtube videos¿ '
2009-04-20T09:53:00.000Z	sheena1	xangua	they won;t play. when I open a youtube video, the firefox "locks up" (turns grey) and i have to force quit
2009-04-20T09:54:00.000Z	xangua	sheena1	the problem is ONLY with youtube videos
2009-04-20T09:54:00.000Z	sheena1	xangua	Ted.com videos won't play either, and some websites. i'm thinking its a flash issue
2009-04-20T09:54:00.000Z	xangua	sheena1	do you use (K)(X)Ubuntu 8.04 ¿
2009-04-20T09:55:00.000Z	sheena1	xangua	Ubuntu 8.10
2009-04-20T10:01:00.000Z	sheena1	xangua	did you have any other ideas?
2009-04-20T10:02:00.000Z	xangua	sheena1	i have 2, you could backup the important things in your FF profile, create a new one and import the important tho the new profile
2009-04-20T10:02:00.000Z	xangua	sheena1	the other is to use a Greasemonkey Script
2009-04-20T10:03:00.000Z	sheena1	xangua	i have no idea what a greasemonkey script is, but i'm pretty desperate
2009-04-20T10:04:00.000Z	xangua	sheena1	greasemonkey is an Addon for Firefox and Scipt are like little programs, to make the pages act diferent
2009-04-20T10:04:00.000Z	sheena1	xangua	i'll look into that too
2009-04-20T10:05:00.000Z	xangua	sheena1	for example i use this scriot to play youtube videos with Mplayer, instead of Flash> http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/38074
2009-04-20T10:06:00.000Z	sheena1	xangua	cool. so it overrides flash alltogether, then
2009-04-20T10:06:00.000Z	xangua	sheena1	and this is another script from the same author for youtube embed videos > http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/46219
2009-04-20T10:08:00.000Z	sheena1	xangua	i've saved both those. nice to have another option in case i can't make it work. frustrating that it DID work before, and now doesn't. i'm thinking backup and re-install the whole darn OS might be the best option at this point..
2009-04-20T10:13:00.000Z	sheena1	xangua	thanks for your help. i gotta run for the night, but i really appreciate it. if i ever get this figured out, i'll come back and let you all know. i appreciate the help VERY much.
