2010-09-17T20:19:00.000Z	nul		I have a shell script question if possible (mayeb using cat, awk, sed, etc...) if i want to nab lets say line 3 of file, until 2nd to last line, is that possible?
2010-09-17T20:20:00.000Z	jrib	nul	sure, either use sed or head/tail together
2010-09-17T20:20:00.000Z	nul		it's not going to 8ghz, CoSmO
2010-09-17T20:21:00.000Z	nul		It might slow it down
2010-09-17T20:21:00.000Z	nul		but not 8ghz.
2010-09-17T20:21:00.000Z	nul		haha
2010-09-17T20:21:00.000Z	nul		it would go down to 1.8 maybe ;)
2010-09-17T20:22:00.000Z	nul	CoSmO	well congratulations you have the fastest laptop processor ever built.. or its being dumb ;)
2010-09-17T20:23:00.000Z	nul	CoSmO	it's not 8ghz dude
2010-09-17T20:23:00.000Z	nul		is it quad core?
2010-09-17T20:23:00.000Z	jrib		!ppc | Delphious
2010-09-17T20:23:00.000Z	nul		well, its not 8ghz.. thas not scaling
2010-09-17T20:24:00.000Z	nul		its 2.26 x 2, which isnt really even 4ghz
2010-09-17T20:24:00.000Z	nul		does it have HT?
2010-09-17T20:24:00.000Z	nul		that would explain teh 8ghz
2010-09-17T20:24:00.000Z	nul		the*
2010-09-17T20:24:00.000Z	nul		"4 cores x 2.26 obviously means 8ghz"
2010-09-17T20:24:00.000Z	nul		hehe
2010-09-17T20:24:00.000Z	jrib		!flash | mada
2010-09-17T20:28:00.000Z	nul	CoSmO	anyway dude I don't really care, it's not running at 8ghz even if ti says so
2010-09-17T20:48:00.000Z	nul		if I want to get lines 3 to 123 of a file, using tail, head, or any other thing, how do I do that?
2010-09-17T20:48:00.000Z	jrib	nul	I said to use sed :)  sed -n START,ENDp
