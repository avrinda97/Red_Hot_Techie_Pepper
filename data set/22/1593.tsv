2010-08-11T14:41:00.000Z	bacon		can someone just confirm me that the ar tool should work well with tar.gz archives?
2010-08-11T14:43:00.000Z	Oer	bacon	manual gives me : a limit on  member-name length may be imposed for compatibility with archive formats maintained with other tools.  If it exists, the limit is often 15 characters
2010-08-11T14:44:00.000Z	bacon	Oer	when it says member-name, does it means the file nalme?
2010-08-11T14:44:00.000Z	Oer		bacon yes, see the description in man
2010-08-11T14:44:00.000Z	Oer		typical of formats related to a.out

2010-08-11T14:45:00.000Z	bacon	Oer	and it didn't change anything
2010-08-11T14:45:00.000Z	bacon	Oer	i'll read the man more carefully, thx for your help
