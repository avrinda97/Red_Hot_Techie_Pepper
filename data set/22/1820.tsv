2012-11-03T01:32:00.000Z	linusoleander		I can do it for mysql, postgresql, redis and so on
2012-11-03T01:34:00.000Z	linusoleander		I need to know the pid for a specific process to be able to track it
2012-11-03T01:34:00.000Z	linusoleander		I don't understand why that's strange
2012-11-03T01:34:00.000Z	jrib	linusoleander	so record the pid when you start it, no?
2012-11-03T01:35:00.000Z	linusoleander	jrib	How?
2012-11-03T01:35:00.000Z	jrib	linusoleander	how are you starting it?
2012-11-03T01:35:00.000Z	jrib	linusoleander	and what is "it"?
2012-11-03T01:36:00.000Z	linusoleander	jrib	Just by calling it. "/usr/bin/mybinary"
2012-11-03T01:36:00.000Z	linusoleander	jrib	It's a bunch of different background processes
2012-11-03T01:37:00.000Z	jrib	linusoleander	that information is available as some bash variable.  See its documentation.  Better yet, ask #bash as they might suggest to you a better way to do what you want
2012-11-03T01:38:00.000Z	linusoleander	jrib	Yes, I know that. but I need to know the exact possision of the pid file before starting it
2012-11-03T01:38:00.000Z	jrib	linusoleander	what?  Why is there suddenly a "pid file" involved?
2012-11-03T01:39:00.000Z	linusoleander	jrib	I need the pid file. Have you ever used monit, god or bluepill?
2012-11-03T01:39:00.000Z	jrib	linusoleander	no.
2012-11-03T01:40:00.000Z	linusoleander	jrib	Anyhow, I need to write a pid file for any background process I start
2012-11-03T01:40:00.000Z	jrib	linusoleander	I think you should state what your actual goal is.
2012-11-03T01:40:00.000Z	linusoleander		I've a background process that's being tracked by monit. Monit needs the pid file to be able to track it
2012-11-03T01:41:00.000Z	jrib	linusoleander	so if a program creates a pid file, give monit the pid file.  If a program does not create a pid file, create it.
2012-11-03T01:41:00.000Z	jrib	linusoleander	although I imagine if you ask monit support there may be a "better way"
2012-11-03T01:43:00.000Z	jrib	linusoleander	here read this: http://mmonit.com/wiki/Monit/FAQ#pidfile
2012-11-03T01:44:00.000Z	linusoleander	jrib	I was a bit fast there, I'm not using monit atm, I'm using bluepill. Thanks anyway
2012-11-03T01:44:00.000Z	linusoleander	jrib	But I get the point
