2007-11-28T01:54:00.000Z	ikonia	pete83	please don't use phrases like WTF
2007-11-28T01:55:00.000Z	pete83	ikonia	Sorry, I forgot you were an 18th century victorian. Won't happen again
2007-11-28T01:55:00.000Z	ikonia	pete83	I'm not, but the channels have rules on langauge, so drop the attitude and get with the program
2007-11-28T01:57:00.000Z	pete83	ikonia	Show me the written rules, or give me a link, or else stop bullying users
2007-11-28T01:57:00.000Z	ikonia	pete83	the rules and guidlines are in the topic
2007-11-28T01:57:00.000Z	ikonia	pete83	asking someone to not use offensive language is not bullying
2007-11-28T01:57:00.000Z	ikonia	pete83	as I said, those are the rules, drop the attitude and get with them
2007-11-28T01:57:00.000Z	pete83	ikonia	there is nothing about it in the topic
2007-11-28T01:58:00.000Z	ikonia	pete83	there are links to be read in the topic
2007-11-28T01:58:00.000Z	ikonia	pete83	or you're welcome to join #ubuntu-ops and ask about the rules
2007-11-28T01:58:00.000Z	pete83	ikonia	and none of them say what you claim. Send me the link
2007-11-28T01:58:00.000Z	ikonia	pete83	you can also read the link from ubotu
2007-11-28T01:59:00.000Z	ikonia	pete83	the link from ubotu will show you the guidelines of the channel
2007-11-28T01:59:00.000Z	pete83	ikonia	thank you, I am reading it now
2007-11-28T01:59:00.000Z	ikonia	pete83	super
2007-11-28T02:00:00.000Z	pete83	ikonia	that's a great Code of Conduct. It is all about attitudes of respect and cooperation. But it says NOTHING about vulgar expressions of surprise, which is what I was using.
2007-11-28T02:01:00.000Z	ikonia	pete83	respect to others is not bad langague
2007-11-28T02:01:00.000Z	ikonia	pete83	the bottom line is, don't use bad language
2007-11-28T02:01:00.000Z	pete83	ikonia	no, bad language is often disrespectful, but in my case it was clearly not a personal attack
2007-11-28T02:02:00.000Z	ikonia	pete83	I didn't say it was a personal attack I asked you not to use it. Either don't use it, or take the issue up in #ubuntu-ops
2007-11-28T02:02:00.000Z	pete83	ikonia	but it's only disrespectful if its an attack
2007-11-28T02:02:00.000Z	ikonia	pete83	don't use the language, or take it up in ubuntu-ops
