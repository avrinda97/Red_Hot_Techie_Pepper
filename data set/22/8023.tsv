2006-03-08T15:09:00.000Z	CanadianSnow		So is there any way to get amsn 0.95 on ubuntu?
2006-03-08T15:09:00.000Z	CanadianSnow		because I used to have it, but then it got messed up, and I tryied to re-install it and now it doesn't work or something :(
2006-03-08T15:11:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	yes there is. just get it from the site
2006-03-11T16:20:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	so is your question "how can i start gparted"?
2006-03-11T16:20:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	type "gparted"
2006-03-11T16:21:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	you need to give a URL
2006-03-11T16:23:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	a URL to the thing *you* pastebinned
2006-03-11T16:25:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	if you want to resize/modify your boot partition, then yeah.
2006-03-11T16:25:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	anyway, you don't have gparted *installed*, so the problem right now is not with gparted, but with the repositories
2006-03-11T16:40:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	try plain "sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"
2006-03-11T16:47:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	if you change any mounted partitions, yeah
2006-03-11T16:48:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	(and "mounted partitions" *does* include the partition you're running ubuntu from)
2006-03-11T16:49:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	dunno exactly what it does, since i use qtparted (not that i use it often anyway)
2006-03-11T16:49:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	in any case, you cannot mount your boot partition, so if you want to resize that one, you really will have to use a live cd
2006-03-11T16:56:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	don't think you need to, you can run gparted from the live cd
2006-03-11T16:56:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	i think it's installed by default
2006-03-11T16:57:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	yeah, just let it boot
2006-03-11T16:58:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	what do you mean?
2006-03-11T16:58:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	of course, you have to *start* gparted after it's booted
2006-03-11T16:58:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	if i'm right that it's installed by default, it will be under Apps somewhere, like Apps / System / Partition editor or similar... if i'm wrong, then "sudo apt-get install gparted" first
2006-03-11T16:59:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	don't think you can
2006-03-17T17:38:00.000Z	LjL	CanadianSnow	Totem, Kaffeine, VLC, mplayer, xine-ui... pick your choice
