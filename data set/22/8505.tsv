2005-07-24T16:14:00.000Z	Velcan		i tried to get my dwl-g630 working for like a day 1/2 before i fed it to the dog
2005-07-24T16:15:00.000Z	MIK3MAN	Velcan	dont tell me that!! I worked with tritium for 2 days to find out I had a bad burn of ubuntu
2005-07-24T16:16:00.000Z	Velcan		the 630 was like the only damn dlink in the dwl-g series that wasnt classified as supposed to work off install

2005-07-24T16:16:00.000Z	Velcan		and the dog got a snack too :) lol
2005-07-24T16:16:00.000Z	MIK3MAN		bob: dont worry, I have a different version and its on the list, I am just a noob when it comes to manual install. Go ahead and tell me what to do plz
