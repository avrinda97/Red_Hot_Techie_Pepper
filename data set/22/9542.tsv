2004-09-30T11:37:00.000Z	DimSum		But it shouldn't be default
2004-09-30T11:38:00.000Z	DimSum		Doesn't matter
2004-09-30T11:38:00.000Z	DimSum		Anyway, the package manager on Unbuntu needs work
2004-09-30T11:38:00.000Z	DimSum		It's ass-hard to see which packages to install for development
2004-09-30T11:38:00.000Z	DimSum		...
2004-09-30T11:38:00.000Z	DimSum		You do realise that in Windows 95, the default behaviour was "spatial"
2004-09-30T11:38:00.000Z	DimSum		Yes it was
2004-09-30T11:39:00.000Z	DimSum		And Microsoft ran a $250,000 usability study
2004-09-30T11:39:00.000Z	djempak	DimSum	uh... so you're telling us that you used Windows 95 for a long time?
2004-09-30T11:39:00.000Z	DimSum	djempak	Sure, I used it until 2K came out
2004-09-30T11:40:00.000Z	djempak	DimSum	you sure it was a computer... and not you dreaming?
2004-09-30T11:40:00.000Z	DimSum	djempak	have you ever even used Windows?
2004-09-30T11:42:00.000Z	djempak	DimSum	win95 didn't add the information of the client statistics to a database
2004-09-30T11:42:00.000Z	DimSum	djempak	Your point?
2004-09-30T11:42:00.000Z	djempak	DimSum	making sure you weren't talking nonsense ;p
2004-09-30T11:44:00.000Z	DimSum	djempak	My point is, it's an inefficient interface method, and one which Gnome shouldn't have forced on their users by default
2004-09-30T11:44:00.000Z	djempak	DimSum	then change it. it's simple. if you don't know howto change it, don't use it, don't complain
2004-09-30T11:44:00.000Z	DimSum	djempak	I have changed it.
2004-09-30T11:44:00.000Z	djempak	DimSum	then don't complain.
2004-09-30T11:44:00.000Z	djempak	DimSum	yeah, you really should
