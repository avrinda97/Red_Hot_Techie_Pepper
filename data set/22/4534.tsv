2007-12-13T09:05:00.000Z	lnxdb		hi
2007-12-13T09:06:00.000Z	lnxdb		is there a way to remove a drive of cd-rom without shutting down the linux like in windows xp?
2007-12-13T09:07:00.000Z	quitte	lnxdb	how is it connected?
2007-12-13T09:08:00.000Z	lnxdb	quitte	this is connected with ide flat cables
2007-12-13T09:08:00.000Z	quitte	lnxdb	pata is not hot plug. don't do it in windows, either
2007-12-13T09:10:00.000Z	quitte	lnxdb	you can unload modules in linux,too. but really don't do it. get sata drives
2007-12-13T09:12:00.000Z	quitte	lnxdb	yes. still it's stupid. pata is not hot pluggable. period.
2007-12-13T09:14:00.000Z	quitte	lnxdb	yes. unload the module of your pata controller. only possible if your rootfs isnt connected thre
2007-12-13T09:14:00.000Z	quitte	lnxdb	or even better: don't do it!
2007-12-13T09:15:00.000Z	quitte	lnxdb	you might destroy your cdrom any other devices connected to the ide bus. the mainbbord and the psu.
2007-12-13T09:15:00.000Z	lnxdb	quitte	hummm
2007-12-13T09:16:00.000Z	quitte	lnxdb	also a fuse might break shutting down other machines. and those are rather likely to happen
2007-12-13T09:16:00.000Z	lnxdb	quitte	this is not a good choice?
2007-12-13T09:16:00.000Z	quitte	lnxdb	pata is not hotpluggable
2007-12-13T09:16:00.000Z	quitte	lnxdb	never was.
2007-12-13T09:16:00.000Z	lnxdb	quitte	and sata?
2007-12-13T09:16:00.000Z	quitte	lnxdb	sata is hot pluggable
2007-12-13T09:18:00.000Z	lnxdb	quitte	ok, but if i unload the modules in linux maybe this works right?
2007-12-13T09:20:00.000Z	quitte	lnxdb	as it worked in xp it might survive. stil a really, really bad idea to do.
2007-12-13T09:22:00.000Z	lnxdb	quitte	hummm... i don't think this, because in the servers versions of windows this is a normal step... i read this in some forums...
2007-12-13T09:22:00.000Z	lnxdb	quitte	i will find some here, wait...
2007-12-13T09:25:00.000Z	lnxdb	quitte	there is a technology named of hot swap that permitts the removal of a drive when a os is running, in real time... (but only a hd that dont have an os installed)
