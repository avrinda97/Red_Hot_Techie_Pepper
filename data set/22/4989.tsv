2008-04-18T04:17:00.000Z	Daisuke_Laptop		okay, how (again) do i find out what's using a particular module?
2008-04-18T04:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Daisuke_Laptop	modules only work for specific hardware
2008-04-18T04:18:00.000Z	Daisuke_Laptop	ikonia	thank you for that bit of wisdom, but that's not what i asked.
2008-04-18T04:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Daisuke_Laptop	what is the question then
2008-04-18T04:19:00.000Z	Daisuke_Laptop	ikonia	the question is what i asked - how to find out what's using a particular module
2008-04-18T04:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Daisuke_Laptop	and if you understood what I said rather than giving me a star response, you'd know
2008-04-18T04:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Daisuke_Laptop	modules can only be used by specific hardware , so therefore if you have an ipw2000 module loaded for example it can ONLY be used by your intel wirless card
2008-04-18T04:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Daisuke_Laptop	processes don't use modules
2008-04-18T04:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Daisuke_Laptop	what modules are you talking about, kernel modules, xorg modules ?
2008-04-18T04:21:00.000Z	Daisuke_Laptop	ikonia	let me give you a quick example
2008-04-18T04:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Daisuke_Laptop	ok, I see what your getting at
2008-04-18T04:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Daisuke_Laptop	with that, thats actually "device file" related
2008-04-18T04:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Daisuke_Laptop	so you know that that module is a "sound" module, so anything using your sound card will need to be shut down
2008-04-18T04:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Daisuke_Laptop	or anything that "locks" your sound card
2008-04-18T04:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Daisuke_Laptop	so in that sort of senario, just work it backwards, eg: module = hardware $X - what software will use hardware $X I'll disalbe it
2008-08-15T05:28:00.000Z	Daisuke_Laptop	ikonia	go to the link that popped up when i entered that
2008-08-15T05:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Daisuke_Laptop	entered what ?
2008-08-15T05:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Daisuke_Laptop	yes it will
2008-08-15T05:45:00.000Z	Daisuke_Laptop	ikonia	ah, nice
2008-08-15T05:45:00.000Z	Daisuke_Laptop	ikonia	wasn't sure that would actually change
2008-08-15T05:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Daisuke_Laptop	base doesn't relese does, check it out
2008-08-15T05:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Daisuke_Laptop	handy to know base release and current update
