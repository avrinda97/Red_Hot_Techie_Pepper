2007-05-29T05:36:00.000Z	nickrud	groove	it keeps at least some of it in apps/system/networking (access it with gconf-editor)
2007-05-29T05:36:00.000Z	groove	nickrud	i've done a gconf-tool --dump and can find any of the settings
2007-05-29T05:37:00.000Z	nickrud	groove	a couple of wireless networks I've defined are in there; network-manager is black magic for me at the moment
2007-05-29T05:39:00.000Z	groove	nickrud	actually, i can't find /apps/system at all ...
2007-05-29T05:40:00.000Z	nickrud	groove	sorry, system is a top level tree, drop the app (I type that from muscle memory, I guess)
2007-05-29T05:41:00.000Z	groove	nickrud	no /system/networking either
2007-05-29T05:42:00.000Z	nickrud	groove	maybe it's only there because I defined some wireless networks ...
2007-05-29T05:44:00.000Z	nickrud	groove	I'm thinking about ditching network manager for a while. I don't understand it, and don't have the inclination to learn
2007-05-29T05:46:00.000Z	groove	nickrud	what will you use to change networks then?
2007-05-29T05:46:00.000Z	nickrud	groove	I used iwconfig and scripts a couple years ago, I might dust that off. I just started using a laptop again
2007-05-29T05:47:00.000Z	nickrud	groove	also I used something called wifi-radar, it's still around but I haven't tried it recently
2007-05-29T05:48:00.000Z	groove	nickrud	well thanks for your help anyway
2007-05-29T05:48:00.000Z	nickrud	groove	I was kinda hoping you'd end up showing me :)
2007-05-29T05:49:00.000Z	groove	nickrud	main problem i'm facing is that i can't see where it stores the settings
2007-05-29T05:58:00.000Z	groove	nickrud	aha, the old version of network-admin (run from /usr/bin/network-admin) stores its details in ~/.gnome2/network-admin-locations
2007-05-29T05:59:00.000Z	nickrud	groove	one step closer :)
2007-05-29T06:09:00.000Z	groove	nickrud	hmm, seems the network manager in feisty is simply running through gksu, therefore the settings are stored in /root/.gnome2/network-admin-locations
2007-05-29T06:09:00.000Z	groove	nickrud	can you see your settings in that location?
2007-05-29T06:10:00.000Z	nickrud	groove	oh, now that really sucks, I don't automatically back up that dir
2007-05-29T06:10:00.000Z	nickrud	groove	and explicitly, yes
2007-05-29T06:11:00.000Z	groove	nickrud	well, it works for me anyway, i mainly wanted to know where the settings were
2007-05-29T06:12:00.000Z	nickrud	groove	I have a better idea of what it's doing, now that I see how it's saving. Thanks
