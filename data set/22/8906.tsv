2005-04-24T15:14:00.000Z	Fast240Z		so I don't have to type the -d?
2005-04-24T15:16:00.000Z	Fast240Z		it still gave me errors
2005-04-24T15:16:00.000Z	Fast240Z		yes I did
2005-04-24T15:17:00.000Z	Fast240Z		exact command was "alien winex3.3.1.rpm"
2005-04-24T15:17:00.000Z	Fast240Z		(the winex part is longer, I just didn't feel like typing it all here)
2005-04-24T15:18:00.000Z	Fast240Z		oh, sorry, I did type sudo
2005-04-24T15:18:00.000Z	Fast240Z		yes I have
2005-04-24T15:19:00.000Z	Fast240Z		the type "sudo passwd root"
2005-04-24T15:19:00.000Z	Fast240Z		*type
2005-04-24T15:20:00.000Z	Fast240Z		yeah, I'm still having some problems with alien, its still giving me errors...anyone know of any other windows emulator?
2005-04-24T15:20:00.000Z	jason	Fast240Z	QEMU
2005-04-24T15:20:00.000Z	Fast240Z		okay, what about converting a tarball file?  alien will do that too
2005-04-24T15:20:00.000Z	Fast240Z		qemu?  can I apt-get that?
2005-04-24T15:20:00.000Z	Fast240Z		or use synaptic to find it
2005-04-24T15:21:00.000Z	Fast240Z		I didn't search for wine, just winex
2005-04-24T15:21:00.000Z	jason	Fast240Z	yes U can apt-get
2005-04-24T15:22:00.000Z	jason	Fast240Z	please note qemu is a virtual PC you need to install windows on it.
2005-04-24T15:22:00.000Z	Fast240Z	jason	is that the same with wine?
2005-04-24T15:22:00.000Z	Fast240Z	jason	I know that winex wasn't like that
2005-04-24T15:22:00.000Z	Fast240Z		cool, I'll try wine
2005-04-24T15:23:00.000Z	Fast240Z		what do you mean
2005-04-24T15:23:00.000Z	jason	Fast240Z	no wine is not an emulator, its libraries to run windows stuff
