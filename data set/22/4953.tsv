2007-12-19T04:17:00.000Z	staykovmarin		hi i am curious, i am running feisty with gnome, would i be able to just download the xubuntu iso and update to gutsy that way?
2007-12-19T04:18:00.000Z	macogw	staykovmarin	none of your gnome stuff would be updated.  you'd still have to update all of ubuntu-desktop
2007-12-19T04:19:00.000Z	staykovmarin	macogw	soundray: is there a way i can install xfce without downloading it? ie, a cd or something like that
2007-12-19T04:20:00.000Z	macogw	staykovmarin	if you get the xubuntu alternate cd, you can add it as a repo and install xubuntu-desktop from it
2007-12-19T04:20:00.000Z	staykovmarin	macogw	thank you, i will do that
2007-12-19T04:22:00.000Z	macogw	staykovmarin	you need the gutsy xubuntu and ubuntu alternate cds.  install the upgrade from the ubuntu one, then install xubuntu-desktop from the xubuntu one
2007-12-19T04:27:00.000Z	macogw	staykovmarin	yes, it has to be alternate in order to use it as a repository
2007-12-19T04:28:00.000Z	staykovmarin	macogw	okay so i will get that one, the live cd so i can update to gutsy, and what else do i need to get xfce?
2007-12-19T04:28:00.000Z	macogw	staykovmarin	no not live cd.  you cant update from live cd.  it has to be the alternate.
2007-12-19T04:29:00.000Z	staykovmarin	macogw	okay, so i am getting the alternate gutsy update one, do i need the alternate xfce one as well?
2007-12-19T04:29:00.000Z	macogw	staykovmarin	yes.  both have to be alternate.
2007-12-19T04:30:00.000Z	macogw	staykovmarin	system > admininstration > software sources lets you add the alternate cds as repositories
2007-12-19T04:31:00.000Z	staykovmarin	macogw	so if i get the alternate cd for XFCE, i can add it, and install xfce that way AFTER i update to gutsy? right?
2007-12-19T04:31:00.000Z	macogw	staykovmarin	yes.
2007-12-19T15:27:00.000Z	macogw	staykovmarin	and if it's ntfs, there are crazy things windows couldve done to it before
2007-12-19T15:27:00.000Z	macogw	staykovmarin	should always defrag ntfs before partitioning, and if the partitioner warns you it could be inconsistent, do as it says and chkdsk /f from windows twice
2007-12-19T15:30:00.000Z	macogw	staykovmarin	there's actually like 3 knowledgeable people and 7 newbies in here right now.
2007-12-19T15:31:00.000Z	macogw	staykovmarin	what format was the partition?
2007-12-19T15:31:00.000Z	staykovmarin	macogw	it was fat32
2007-12-19T15:31:00.000Z	macogw	staykovmarin	there are diagnostic tools on Helix (Knoppix based forensics distro that runs from cd) that you can use for recovery
2007-12-19T15:39:00.000Z	macogw	staykovmarin	any will do
2007-12-19T15:44:00.000Z	macogw	staykovmarin	if you have two optical drives
