2010-07-02T20:43:00.000Z	sathyabhat		Greetings.
2010-07-02T20:44:00.000Z	sathyabhat		Need some help with ntfs-3g, ntfscp and compressed ntfs files, help would be much appreciated.
2010-07-02T20:46:00.000Z	sathyabhat		I have Win 7 / Ubuntu wubi / openSUSE 11.2 install. Now I compressed the root folder, so Win 7 stopped booting, throws bootmgr is compressed
2010-07-02T20:46:00.000Z	bluebaron	sathyabhat	what boot manager?
2010-07-02T20:47:00.000Z	sathyabhat		Is there a way I can decompress the file by copying to my ext3 partition ? I tried this [ http://serverfault.com/questions/137877/decompressing-files-on-an-ntfs-volume-from-linux/137906#137906 ] but seems now ntfscp does copy with compress attribute
2010-07-02T20:47:00.000Z	bluebaron	sathyabhat	doesn't matter ... just look up the instructions for reinstalling the boot manager to the boot record ... prolly just needs to be rewritten
2010-07-02T20:48:00.000Z	sathyabhat	bluebaron	I'm not sure which bot manager is being used. I'm guessing WIn 7's default + wubi which boots into Ubuntu
2010-07-02T20:49:00.000Z	bluebaron		just get super grub disk or something
2010-07-02T20:49:00.000Z	bluebaron		yeah that's what it's called
2010-07-02T20:49:00.000Z	bluebaron		that will fix you up
2010-07-02T20:49:00.000Z	sathyabhat	bluebaron	Part of the problem is that my laptop dvd drive is conked,so I can't use the WIn 7 disk image. to fix it up.
2010-07-02T20:50:00.000Z	bluebaron	sathyabhat	do you have a usb key?
2010-07-02T20:50:00.000Z	sathyabhat	bluebaron	yes
2010-07-02T20:50:00.000Z	bluebaron		there you go
2010-07-02T20:50:00.000Z	sathyabhat	bluebaron	Still fuzzy about how to install Win's boot manager using super grub disk
2010-07-02T20:51:00.000Z	bluebaron	sathyabhat	it's not your windows loader that's fucked
2010-07-02T20:51:00.000Z	sathyabhat	bluebaron	oh ?
2010-07-02T20:52:00.000Z	bluebaron		yes ... i'm pretty sure sgd will get you fixed up
2010-07-02T20:53:00.000Z	sathyabhat	bluebaron	Alright, i'll d/l it and try it.
2010-07-02T21:09:00.000Z	sathyabhat	bluebaron	Used SuperGrubDisk, got access to my openSUSE partition. Thanks.
2010-07-02T21:09:00.000Z	bluebaron	sathyabhat	awesome sauce
2010-07-02T21:10:00.000Z	sathyabhat	bluebaron	Thanks for the pointer to SGD. I'll prolly figure out how to get Windows running, but I'm in no hurry to do that.
