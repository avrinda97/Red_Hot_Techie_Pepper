2005-02-15T14:24:00.000Z	neom		any of you guys see xandros before?
2005-02-15T14:25:00.000Z	neom		It'
2005-02-15T14:25:00.000Z	neom		It's a distro.....
2005-02-15T14:26:00.000Z	neom		You ever seen it running?
2005-02-15T14:26:00.000Z	neom		I've heard some interesting things about it at work today.
2005-02-15T14:27:00.000Z	neom		lifeless - Fuck user friendly, it runs -all- windows programs provided they have a valid install protocal.

2005-02-15T14:29:00.000Z	neom		Well, that's what I was shown at work today by the rep. I took installed frash install, took a windows xp office CD, installed it, and ran it. And then he took a half life cd, installed it and ran it.
2005-02-15T14:29:00.000Z	mcphail	neom	try CrossoverOffice on any distro
2005-02-15T14:30:00.000Z	neom	mcphail	- That's not the point.
2005-02-15T14:30:00.000Z	mcphail	neom	isn't that what is running in xandros???
2005-02-15T14:31:00.000Z	neom		Well, he said they build the os to run windows applications. And he told me that if we implment it, it would run everything we currently run on windows.
2005-02-15T14:31:00.000Z	neom		mc - Not that I am aware of.
2005-02-15T14:31:00.000Z	neom		But I odn't know.
2005-02-15T14:32:00.000Z	neom		Anyway, what I was asking was, has anyone seen this implemented on a wide scale. I've only seen it on one pc from a company rep.. I wondered if anyone else has seen it running.
2005-02-15T14:32:00.000Z	neom		That was my next question.
2005-02-15T14:32:00.000Z	mcphail	neom	I've never used Xandros but I believe the subscription fee covers the cost of Crossover.
2005-02-15T14:32:00.000Z	neom		I asked the rap that and he kinda avoided the question.
2005-02-15T14:33:00.000Z	neom		*rep
2005-02-15T14:33:00.000Z	mcphail	neom	give me a minute and i'll find a link about the viruses...
2005-02-15T14:35:00.000Z	neom		yup
