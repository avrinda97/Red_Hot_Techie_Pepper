2012-04-22T00:18:00.000Z	dipper		I built my own kernel
2012-04-22T00:18:00.000Z	dipper		3.0.22
2012-04-22T00:18:00.000Z	dipper		but my system is installed using WUBI
2012-04-22T00:18:00.000Z	dipper		yeah
2012-04-22T00:18:00.000Z	dipper		:)
2012-04-22T00:18:00.000Z	dipper		sorry
2012-04-22T00:18:00.000Z	dipper		my system is installed using WUBI
2012-04-22T00:19:00.000Z	dipper		so the problem is that my own kernel is stuck in initramfs
2012-04-22T00:19:00.000Z	dipper		I can still boot using others
2012-04-22T00:19:00.000Z	Gnea	dipper	did you generate an initrd.img?
2012-04-22T00:20:00.000Z	Gnea	dipper	okay, using make-kpkg? and what version of ubuntu?
2012-04-22T00:21:00.000Z	dipper	Gnea	i generated my kernel as Ubuntu documentation describes, I got deb packages, REASON says = ALERT! /dev/disk/by-uuid/ not found
2012-04-22T00:22:00.000Z	Gnea	dipper	okay, well as of 10.04, the initrd files have to be copied manually and mkinitrd ran on its own after make-kpkg is done and the packages are installed... did you go through these steps in that order?
2012-04-22T00:23:00.000Z	dipper	Gnea	I am not sure
2012-04-22T00:23:00.000Z	Gnea	dipper	well, what version are you on? lsb_release -r
2012-04-22T00:24:00.000Z	dipper	Gnea	I am on 3.0.0.17 and I built 3.0.22, but I actually wanted to modify the same version
2012-04-22T00:25:00.000Z	Gnea	dipper	I'm talking about ubuntu version, not kernel version
2012-04-22T00:25:00.000Z	dipper	Gnea	11.10
2012-04-22T00:26:00.000Z	Gnea	dipper	okay, and which documentation are you using?
2012-04-22T00:28:00.000Z	dipper	Gnea	let me go back and read about ram disk
2012-04-22T00:28:00.000Z	Gnea	dipper	okay
