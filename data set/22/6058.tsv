2006-12-28T10:53:00.000Z	VoX		why would i get a systemload of 6+ when copying files from a pata drive to a sata drive? the pata drive has dma enabled, rest of the system is essentially idle.
2006-12-28T10:53:00.000Z	chand|	VoX	not a big load for this
2006-12-28T10:54:00.000Z	VoX	chand|	well when it causes text input into a terminal session to lag by multiple seconds, i'd call that a slight issue..
