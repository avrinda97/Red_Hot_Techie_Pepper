2011-01-18T23:59:00.000Z	Sprechkaese		hello, i need detailed information to a problem caused my a hard drive, anyone here can help?
2011-01-19T00:01:00.000Z	Sprechkaese		I have a harddrive which seems to have a software problem. when i plug it in (via USB) is is listet at /dev/sdb1 (seen via "mount") but when I try to rescue data with ddrescue it can not be found
2011-01-19T00:01:00.000Z	Sprechkaese		also e2fsck can not find it
2011-01-19T00:02:00.000Z	Sprechkaese		ddrescue: cannot open input file: No such file or directory
2011-01-19T00:02:00.000Z	Sprechkaese		mount gives: /dev/sdb1 on /media/5EDC593FDC59129F type fuseblk (rw)
2011-01-19T00:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sprechkaese	is it mounted when you usd dd_rescue?
2011-01-19T00:03:00.000Z	Sprechkaese		when i plug it in, i can see the drive, for a short time and have no exit to it, afterwards it dissapeares and another one "is mounted", but there is no data on that "new" disc
2011-01-19T00:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ayecee: ls doesn't show files on raw block devices
2011-01-19T00:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!antivirus
2011-01-19T00:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ayecee: makes sense
2011-01-19T00:05:00.000Z	Sprechkaese	ayecee	yes, it says no such directory
2011-01-19T00:06:00.000Z	Sprechkaese		i tried to remount the drive, and that worked
2011-01-19T00:06:00.000Z	Sprechkaese		but still there are no files on the drive
2011-01-19T00:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sprechkaese	the partition needs to be unmounted to use dd_rescue
2011-01-19T00:06:00.000Z	Sprechkaese		although i see that 164GB are used space via right click
2011-01-19T00:07:00.000Z	Sprechkaese		/dev/sda  /dev/sda1  /dev/sda2  /dev/sda5  /dev/sda6  /dev/sda7  /dev/sdc  /dev/sdc1
2011-01-19T00:07:00.000Z	Sprechkaese		no, sdc1 is my other hard drive
2011-01-19T00:08:00.000Z	Sprechkaese		friend brought it to me saying it does not work on windows anymore
2011-01-19T00:09:00.000Z	Sprechkaese		tried that, cant find it either
2011-01-19T00:09:00.000Z	Sprechkaese		its a SATA, hooked op via a sata/usb converter
2011-01-19T00:09:00.000Z	Sprechkaese		converter works, tried it on another drive
2011-01-19T00:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sprechkaese	if the data is needed, unmount all the drives partitions and use foremost to attempt a data recover on the raw drive
