2011-01-15T11:46:00.000Z	JackyAlcine		Help! hard drive problem! I can't format and it's complaining about a failure.
2011-01-15T11:46:00.000Z	ddr400	JackyAlcine	what type of failure?
2011-01-15T11:47:00.000Z	ddr400	JackyAlcine	you have to tell us which SMART parameters are failing
2011-01-15T11:49:00.000Z	ddr400	JackyAlcine	do immediately a backup
2011-01-15T11:50:00.000Z	ddr400	JackyAlcine	i guess no, they are hardware problems on the drive, if you have the warranty do a RMA now
2011-01-15T11:51:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	ddr400	>_< This is horrible. p_res, should I just ignore it for now while I wait for the warranty shipment?
2011-01-15T11:52:00.000Z	ddr400	JackyAlcine	i quote p_res answer
2011-01-15T11:52:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	ddr400	fsck returns an bad magic number error p_res how about zero-bitting?
2011-01-15T11:53:00.000Z	ddr400	JackyAlcine	you have to use Seagate's own software to do that
2011-01-15T11:55:00.000Z	ddr400	JackyAlcine	have you understood our last answers?
2011-01-15T11:56:00.000Z	ddr400	JackyAlcine	you ran it from a dos bootable usb key :-D
2011-01-15T11:59:00.000Z	ddr400	JackyAlcine	you you need to pick a different hard disk, i strongly recommend you to pick a WD one
2011-01-15T12:00:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	ddr400	I'll try to keep that in mind in the near future.
2011-01-15T12:40:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	ddr400	I got around the issue by formatting it to the Minix format.
2011-01-15T13:37:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	ddr400	I tried formatting the system to jfs, and it seemed to work.
2011-01-15T13:37:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	ddr400	But it hung on the Ubuquity installer.
2011-01-15T13:38:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	ddr400	It doesn't work with any of the ext* family formats.
2011-01-15T13:39:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	ddr400	It can format to Minix, FAT16/32, or even swap.
2011-01-15T13:41:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	ddr400	I don't have a Windows system to run it on though. Should I try WINE'ing it?
2011-01-15T13:48:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	ddr400	I found something! They have a Seagate recovery system based on FreeDOS!
2011-01-15T13:51:00.000Z	ddr400	JackyAlcine	i told you
2011-01-15T13:52:00.000Z	ddr400	JackyAlcine	try a low level format, could save you hard disk
