2006-04-03T11:56:00.000Z	rkalsi		Hi Guys. first timer installing ubuntu. Got stuck at Installing the base system step...
2006-04-03T11:56:00.000Z	trappist	rkalsi	first guess there is 'bad cd'
2006-04-03T11:57:00.000Z	rkalsi		At about 6%, it complains about not being able to download smome package & then gives an error & stops
2006-04-03T11:57:00.000Z	rkalsi	trappist	i tried with 2 different CDs
2006-04-03T11:57:00.000Z	rkalsi		inboth cases, it gets stuck at 6%
2006-04-03T11:57:00.000Z	rkalsi		so there is surely, sthing else going wrong
2006-04-03T11:57:00.000Z	trappist	rkalsi	you burned these yourself?
2006-04-03T11:57:00.000Z	rkalsi		One via post, the other i burned frm iso..
2006-04-03T11:58:00.000Z	trappist	rkalsi	if the cd's are good, my next guess is bad hard drive or damaged filesystem - you could try reformatting
2006-04-03T11:58:00.000Z	rkalsi		I did,, that doesnt complain at all..
2006-04-03T11:58:00.000Z	rkalsi		formatting seems all good.
2006-04-03T11:58:00.000Z	trappist	rkalsi	happen to know what package and the text of the error message?
2006-04-03T11:58:00.000Z	rkalsi		 question ? WHat are the basic partitions needed ?
2006-04-03T11:59:00.000Z	rkalsi		I have root, /home & swap memory
2006-04-03T11:59:00.000Z	trappist	rkalsi	you can get away with just / - how to partition depends on how you plan to use it
2006-04-03T11:59:00.000Z	rkalsi	trappist	the errors go of too fast, cant really tell which one is the first
2006-04-03T11:59:00.000Z	rkalsi		it seems to be some ;libraries..
2006-04-03T12:00:00.000Z	rkalsi	trappist	any other ideas, other than bad disk,?
2006-04-03T12:01:00.000Z	trappist	rkalsi	bad cdrom drive?  it totally sounds like the problem is with getting a package from the cd to the hard drive, in which case it's either the media or a hardware issue
2006-04-03T12:01:00.000Z	trappist	rkalsi	you could try flight5 and see if you have better luck with that
2006-04-03T12:01:00.000Z	rkalsi		flight5 ?
2006-04-03T12:01:00.000Z	trappist	rkalsi	sort of a preview of the next version
