2011-07-09T02:35:00.000Z	Delrayne	mongy	so what do I have to do to make it work?
2011-07-09T02:35:00.000Z	mongy	Delrayne	I just came here, I dont know what you done already
2011-07-09T02:36:00.000Z	Delrayne	mongy	^
2011-07-09T02:37:00.000Z	mongy	Delrayne	well the lp-phy model is the low power model and only really supported by the sta driver.. I tried b43 and its utter junk
2011-07-09T02:37:00.000Z	mongy	Delrayne	remove all what you installed and reinstall bcmwl-kernel-source
2011-07-09T02:37:00.000Z	Delrayne	mongy	I don't really understand that..wish I could share your grief, but yeah.
2011-07-09T02:38:00.000Z	mongy	Delrayne	you can install it during install of ubuntu btw.
2011-07-09T02:38:00.000Z	mongy	Delrayne	in fact, if that stupid bug ubuntu refuse to fix is still there, its actually best to do that
2011-07-09T02:39:00.000Z	mongy	Delrayne	sudo modprobe wl
2011-07-09T02:40:00.000Z	mongy	Delrayne	I used this one since 8.04 without problems
2011-07-09T02:40:00.000Z	Delrayne	mongy	did that and just gave me a fresh new prompt
2011-07-09T02:41:00.000Z	mongy	Delrayne	now do you have wireless options in network managers?
2011-07-09T02:41:00.000Z	Delrayne	mongy	the sudo command didn't do anything.
2011-07-09T02:42:00.000Z	mongy	Delrayne	it wont show any output..... thats fine
2011-07-09T02:43:00.000Z	mongy	Delrayne	sudo rmmod b43
2011-07-09T02:44:00.000Z	Delrayne	mongy	ERROR: Module b43 does not exist in /proc/modules
2011-07-09T02:44:00.000Z	mongy	Delrayne	reboot then.
2011-07-09T02:46:00.000Z	mongy	Delrayne	 dude.  just choose install, tick both boxes for updates and 3rd party software, it will hang for a little, then your driver will be installed.  then connect to net with network manager and continue with partitioner etc.
2011-07-09T02:46:00.000Z	mongy	Delrayne	thats the easy way around this
2011-07-09T02:47:00.000Z	Delrayne	mongy	usr13: thanks for all the help and patience.
