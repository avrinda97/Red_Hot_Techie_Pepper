2009-09-12T08:44:00.000Z	Logomachist		I have a problem. After logging in, the desktop comes up but without the menu bar. I have a mouse cursor, and I have wallpaper and  ctrl + alt + delete works. The "Help" button on the "restart the computer" menu brings up the help window but without the title bar. But that's all I can get to. Alt + F2 doesn't work. Has anyone else run into anything like this?

2009-09-12T09:53:00.000Z	mezquitale	Logomachist	you want to talk to a guru, you have to come back when someone like DrWillis is around
2009-09-12T09:55:00.000Z	mezquitale	Logomachist	sounds like your bug and socratees bug should be sent in to the developers
2009-09-12T09:58:00.000Z	mezquitale	Logomachist	your luck just got better Dr_Willis is in the house
2009-09-12T10:07:00.000Z	mezquitale	Logomachist	 you have to type the name first, as in the first few letters, then tab it, if he's using xchat he'll see it red and he'll know it's addressed to him
2009-09-12T10:13:00.000Z	mezquitale	Logomachist	there are other gurus that come in the room every now and then so don't despair, just try different times, it's night time most of America, maybe some europeans will log in when it's night time in their time zone

2009-09-12T10:24:00.000Z	Logomachist	mezquitale	How do I create another user w/out the GUI?
2009-09-12T10:25:00.000Z	mezquitale	Logomachist	try what Peddy is suggesting first, if you still cant resolve your problem then just goggle on how to add/remove users using the command line
2009-09-12T10:25:00.000Z	Logomachist	mezquitale	ok
2009-09-12T10:28:00.000Z	mezquitale	Logomachist	dont capitalize his nick, nobody likes that, instead type the first few letters of his nick, tab it and use the nick exactly as it appears
