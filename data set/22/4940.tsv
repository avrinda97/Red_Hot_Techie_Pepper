2008-01-19T22:39:00.000Z	nownot_	un0p	yes well i have several sites on my home server and i want to set them up on vhost so nownot.sytes.net will take me to my blog
2008-01-19T22:40:00.000Z	un0p	nownot_	you need to make sure all hostnames resolve to your machines ip address (192.168.2.7 possible?) then -- you do that by configuring your DNS server or /etc/hosts
2008-01-19T22:40:00.000Z	nownot_	un0p	yes it just confused me
2008-01-19T22:40:00.000Z	un0p	nownot_	what confused you?
2008-01-19T22:41:00.000Z	nownot_	un0p	what exactly i need to put an how
2008-01-19T22:42:00.000Z	un0p	nownot_	i'm not sure whether you are setting up vhosts for a local intranet or you want people on the internet to be able to view content on the vhosts ?
2008-01-19T22:42:00.000Z	un0p	nownot_	what are the vhosts names?
2008-01-19T22:42:00.000Z	nownot_	un0p	i want to be able to go to nownot.sytes.net on the internet and it take me to /var/www/blog on my home server
2008-01-19T22:42:00.000Z	nownot_	un0p	vhost name is blog
2008-01-19T22:43:00.000Z	un0p	nownot_	well, ok, does nownot.sytes.net resolve to your public ip address ?
2008-01-19T22:43:00.000Z	nownot_	un0p	this is my apache2 -S
2008-01-19T22:45:00.000Z	nownot_	un0p	any ideas?
2008-01-19T22:47:00.000Z	un0p	nownot_	well, if this is your website http://nownot.sytes.net -- i think it's jsut a matter of adding another vhost configuration file and apache should take care of the rest
2008-01-19T22:48:00.000Z	nownot_	un0p	how the hell did that work?
2008-01-19T22:48:00.000Z	un0p	nownot_	whats that?
2008-01-19T22:49:00.000Z	un0p	nownot_	the only thing i am concerned about is nownot.sytes.net resolves to one IP but a different one is shown on the browser when i navigate to http://nownot.sytes.net
2008-01-19T22:49:00.000Z	un0p	nownot_	maybe you configured that intentionally -- but it sure as hell is weird
2008-01-19T22:50:00.000Z	nownot_	un0p	can i pm  i get lost in here/
2008-01-19T22:52:00.000Z	nownot_	un0p	ok well what do you mean different ip when i go to either i get the same ip
2008-01-19T22:53:00.000Z	un0p	nownot_	well, if i query a dns server -- nownot.sytes.net resolves to 204.16.252.xx  but when i navigate to nownot.sytes.net, i get redirected to 71.170.196.xxx:8080
2008-01-19T22:54:00.000Z	nownot_	un0p	well maybe its b/c im going through no-ip.com for dns?
2008-01-19T22:55:00.000Z	un0p	nownot_	it shouldn't matter  -- maybe the change in DNS still hasn't propogated over to my ISPs dns server ust yet .. never mind, if it's working for you, its good :)
