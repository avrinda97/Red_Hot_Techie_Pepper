2011-04-29T13:53:00.000Z	ilon		just upgraded, unity is.... different.
2011-04-29T13:54:00.000Z	ilon		where did my taskbar go?! :<<
2011-04-29T13:54:00.000Z	incorrect1	ilon	its on the left hand side
2011-04-29T13:54:00.000Z	ilon	incorrect1	no, thats a launcherbar :(
2011-04-29T13:55:00.000Z	incorrect1	ilon	all your tasks should be there
2011-04-29T13:55:00.000Z	ilon	incorrect1	so they should, but its more of a "programbar" than a taskbar
2011-04-29T13:56:00.000Z	incorrect1	ilon	well to me it encompasses all the same functionality, list of apps and their status
2011-04-29T13:56:00.000Z	ilon	incorrect1	how can i customize it?
2011-04-29T13:57:00.000Z	ilon	incorrect1	problem is that since i usally have alot o windows open, the old taskbar was rather nice for me to switch between windows
2011-04-29T13:57:00.000Z	incorrect1	ilon	same here
2011-04-29T13:58:00.000Z	ilon	incorrect1	i know the concept from OS X, but it feels half done :(
2011-04-29T13:59:00.000Z	incorrect1	ilon	i agree,
2011-04-29T13:59:00.000Z	ilon	incorrect1	guess i have to switch to something else as usual :(
2011-04-29T14:00:00.000Z	ilon	incorrect1	yeah, seems too early, shouldve came as optional for another few months
2011-04-29T14:00:00.000Z	incorrect1	ilon	i bet in a week i will get irritated and go back to gnome2 or find a unity ppa
2011-04-29T14:00:00.000Z	ilon	incorrect1	i'll probably just switch back to XFCE / FFWM again
2011-04-29T14:01:00.000Z	incorrect1	ilon	11.10 will see it mature
2011-04-29T14:01:00.000Z	ilon	incorrect1	yeah, i can only imagine how bad that would be on my workstation at home with 3x2 physical monitors
2011-04-29T14:24:00.000Z	ilon	incorrect1	irony, worthless on the internet since -90s
2011-04-29T14:25:00.000Z	incorrect1	ilon	i don't have any milk for my coffee this morning
2011-04-29T14:26:00.000Z	ilon	incorrect1	you can take some of mine, my coffe allmost came in return this morning :(
