2008-11-10T06:36:00.000Z	panfist	karsten	i have been messing with mixer settings all weekend. i have tried sending audio over HDMI and analog. i havent been able to successfully install any drivers besides those that were installed during the ubuntu installation
2008-11-10T06:36:00.000Z	karsten	panfist	You do have sound at startup?
2008-11-10T06:37:00.000Z	karsten	panfist	Does your user belong to the 'audio' group?  Can root run sound programs?
2008-11-10T06:37:00.000Z	panfist	karsten	i am using 8.04 server 64 bit. before the splash screen i see some startup text scrolling by and i can hear an audible hiss during this part of the boot, and then no other sound
2008-11-10T06:37:00.000Z	panfist	karsten	i have not tried running any sound programs as root, so far i have just been testing in system>preferences>sound
2008-11-10T06:37:00.000Z	karsten	panfist	That hiss may not be system sound.
2008-11-10T06:38:00.000Z	panfist	karsten	well if my analog cables between speaker and motherboard are not plugged in i dont hear it
2008-11-10T06:38:00.000Z	karsten	panfist	I generally install 'sox' which includes the 'play' command.  That should be able to play any sound file.
2008-11-10T06:38:00.000Z	karsten	panfist	Hrm.
2008-11-10T06:38:00.000Z	panfist	karsten	how would i add myself to the audio group
2008-11-10T06:39:00.000Z	karsten	panfist	sudo adduser <your user ID> audio
2008-11-10T06:39:00.000Z	karsten	panfist	Log off and back in for it to take effect.
2008-11-10T06:39:00.000Z	panfist	karsten	i am already a member of the audio group, so that's not the issue
2008-11-10T06:40:00.000Z	karsten	panfist	Ok.
2008-11-10T06:40:00.000Z	karsten	panfist	You've read the audio factoid?
2008-11-10T06:40:00.000Z	karsten	panfist	Gotta split.
2008-11-10T06:40:00.000Z	panfist	karsten	thanks
