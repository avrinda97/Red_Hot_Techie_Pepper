2005-04-04T09:31:00.000Z	keizer		Ubuntu didn't ask me for a root password!
2005-04-04T09:32:00.000Z	keizer		Site Error
2005-04-04T09:32:00.000Z	keizer		An error was encountered while publishing this resource.
2005-04-04T09:32:00.000Z	keizer		The site isn't working
2005-04-04T09:33:00.000Z	keizer		Where?
2005-04-04T09:35:00.000Z	keizer		LMAO
2005-04-04T09:37:00.000Z	keizer		OMG this is such a lame hack
2005-04-04T09:37:00.000Z	keizer		I like using root
2005-04-04T09:37:00.000Z	Kamion	keizer	set the root password, then ('sudo passwd root'); it's just a default
2005-04-04T09:38:00.000Z	keizer	Kamion	I'm trying to use Sudo and it says my user is not in the sudoers file
2005-04-04T09:39:00.000Z	Kamion	keizer	erm; is that a fresh install? did anything funny happen during the install?
2005-04-04T09:41:00.000Z	Kamion	keizer	you could certainly boot in recovery mode and repair it, though
2005-04-04T09:41:00.000Z	Kamion	keizer	again, from what CD?
2005-04-04T09:41:00.000Z	Kamion	keizer	Hoary has not been released. What test CD did you use?
2005-04-04T09:41:00.000Z	Kamion	keizer	there are a *lot* of possibilities
2005-04-04T09:42:00.000Z	keizer	Kamion	 I downloaded it two days ago
2005-04-04T09:42:00.000Z	Kamion	keizer	so a daily build, or a preview, or Array CD 7, or what?
2005-04-04T09:42:00.000Z	keizer	Kamion	Preview
2005-04-04T09:43:00.000Z	Kamion	keizer	'passwd root' and set a root password
2005-04-04T09:43:00.000Z	Kamion	keizer	then you can use su all you want
2005-04-04T09:43:00.000Z	Kamion	keizer	impressive, I've installed preview lots and never saw that bug
2005-04-04T09:43:00.000Z	Kamion	keizer	yes, what lamont said
