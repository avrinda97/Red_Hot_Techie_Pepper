2008-06-11T18:07:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		that's how mine's setup, and I get 100megs a second
2008-06-11T18:08:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		my config was built with gproftpd, and I set it to no cap
2008-06-11T18:09:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		arg
2008-06-11T18:09:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		there is a cap
2008-06-11T18:09:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		lol
2008-06-11T18:10:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		it's 2444 up and 1794 down
2008-06-11T18:10:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		lemme fix that and see what it says
2008-06-11T18:10:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		no idea
2008-06-11T18:10:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		just gonna crank it until it doesn't go anymore
2008-06-11T18:11:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		basically, the higher you set the numbers, the faster it goes, I'm just gonna try like 999999
2008-06-11T18:12:00.000Z	rampageoberon	RabidWeezle	its kilobytes/s
2008-06-11T17:59:00.000Z	rampageoberon	RabidWeezle	would you know why I am able to get a full 100mbit over dc++ but only 45mbit over ftp? out of curiosity
2008-06-11T18:01:00.000Z	rampageoberon	RabidWeezle	umm, how can i check, using proftpd and not seen any such cap in the conf file
2008-06-11T18:02:00.000Z	rampageoberon	RabidWeezle	can't do gproftpd as its a server os and no gui
2008-06-11T18:03:00.000Z	rampageoberon	RabidWeezle	maybe if you can locate the line in the gproftpd conf file
2008-06-11T18:05:00.000Z	rampageoberon	RabidWeezle	thanks :)
2008-06-11T18:05:00.000Z	rampageoberon	RabidWeezle	not sure if its a system wide thing as get max 4mb/s over http too (lighttpd server)
2008-06-11T18:08:00.000Z	rampageoberon	RabidWeezle	from what i can see there is some ratelimiting (TransferRate RETR 1794 for example) i'll check more on this
2008-06-11T18:08:00.000Z	rampageoberon	RabidWeezle	i have no such lines in my config
2008-06-11T18:09:00.000Z	rampageoberon	RabidWeezle	thanks for this, i'll play around with my config and see what happens
2008-06-11T18:10:00.000Z	rampageoberon	RabidWeezle	hehe, i thought there was
2008-06-11T18:10:00.000Z	rampageoberon	RabidWeezle	what units are those in
