2007-04-30T11:55:00.000Z	jrsims		hey, is there a way I can make wireshark start with admin options without typing sudo first?
2007-04-30T11:55:00.000Z	jrsims		Like if I launched it from the menu?
2007-04-30T11:57:00.000Z	jrsims		I will try gksu
2007-04-30T11:58:00.000Z	clearzen	jrsims	if you can I would compile the latest svn source...it allows realtime monitoring of the packets. I think it is much better than the wireshark in the repos
2007-04-30T11:58:00.000Z	jrsims	clearzen	I am spoiled by apt though!
2007-04-30T11:58:00.000Z	clearzen	jrsims	It rocks. trust me :)
2007-04-30T11:59:00.000Z	jrsims	clearzen	if I do what you say, I wont have to wait until packet capture is complete to view packet detail?
2007-04-30T11:59:00.000Z	jrsims	clearzen	NICE
2007-04-30T11:59:00.000Z	clearzen	jrsims	It's great for authoring packets in real time
2007-04-30T12:00:00.000Z	jrsims	clearzen	for man in the middle?
2007-04-30T12:00:00.000Z	clearzen	jrsims	or chop chop or aircrack-ptw...so many uses
2007-04-30T12:00:00.000Z	jrsims	clearzen	you use airsnort or kismet?
2007-04-30T12:01:00.000Z	jrsims	clearzen	ok, I'm sold. what are the steps?
2007-04-30T12:02:00.000Z	clearzen	jrsims	kismet and aircrack suite, cowpatty all the usual tools. Go to the main site and go to the dev branch and get the latest svn tarball, unzip ./configure &&make && sudo checkinstall
2007-04-30T12:35:00.000Z	jrsims	clearzen	hey, you here?
2007-04-30T12:35:00.000Z	jrsims	clearzen	in wireshark... is there a way to do a search in sent/received plaintext?
2007-04-30T12:36:00.000Z	clearzen	jrsims	yeah, did you run into a problem?
2007-04-30T12:37:00.000Z	jrsims	clearzen	no
2007-04-30T12:37:00.000Z	clearzen	jrsims	So what do you think then?
2007-04-30T12:37:00.000Z	jrsims	clearzen	it is sweet
2007-04-30T12:38:00.000Z	clearzen	jrsims	if you are looking to get reconstruct a packet stream filtering by MAC would help you quite a bit if that is what you mean.
2007-04-30T12:42:00.000Z	clearzen	jrsims	I have a 600 page book on ethereal/wirshark you may like it is called Syngress.Wireshark.and.Ethereal.Network.Protocol.Analyzer.Toolkit. I would at least get it for reference if you want to use wireshark effectively.
