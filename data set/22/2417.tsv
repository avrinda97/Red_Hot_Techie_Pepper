2009-06-17T15:02:00.000Z	GenericBox		Hi. I was wondering if someone could help me install Ubuntu. I have a problem (I think). I'm semi noob :P
2009-06-17T15:02:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	ask away
2009-06-17T15:05:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	reboot into windows, and run a disk check
2009-06-17T15:06:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	you'll need to reboot windows twice (cleanly!) and then reboot (cleanly!) into the ubuntu installer
2009-06-17T15:06:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	ubuntu's installer won't touch a windows disk by default if it's been marked as not cleanly shut down
2009-06-17T15:10:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	you need to boot into windows, run the disk check, the disk check will ask you to reboot so it can scan the disk, and then you need to reboot again into ubuntu
2009-06-17T15:18:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	not terribly
2009-06-17T15:26:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	should Just Work now ;p
2009-06-17T15:37:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	how recently you've made backups of things you can't bare to lose mostly.  You can always resize again later, although it gets time consuming
2009-06-17T15:37:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	50/50 split for now is safe
2009-06-17T15:38:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	by default, ubuntu can read windows files, but there's no really good way for windows to read ubuntu's files
2009-06-17T15:47:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	the resize?  yes
2009-06-17T16:03:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	only really during the install, although there's not a whole lot in the way of settings to be imported
2009-06-17T16:03:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	you can always copy stuff over by hand
2009-06-17T16:03:00.000Z	GenericBox	cwillu	ok - im just worried about duplicating what i dont need. Are the settings important? Because I can still access them anyway right?
2009-06-17T16:04:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	duplication really isn't a huge deal from a space perspective.  I mean, the most wasteful duplication of configuration settings and documents and so forth still wouldn't fill a 10gb drive, let alone the 150gb - 500gb drive you probably have :)
2009-06-17T16:31:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	do you remember the username and password you set during the install?
2009-06-17T16:31:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	if not, you can reset the password by booting into the recovery console and running passwd <your username>
2009-06-17T16:32:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	reboot, and hit escape at the grub prompt
2009-06-17T16:33:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	ls /home/ will show a list
2009-06-17T16:37:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	enable the multiverse repository, and then install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2009-06-17T16:40:00.000Z	cwillu	GenericBox	yes, works pretty much the same way
