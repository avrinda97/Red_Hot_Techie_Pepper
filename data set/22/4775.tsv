2010-09-30T00:00:00.000Z	jrib	turgon_	you would never want to do that
2010-09-30T00:00:00.000Z	turgon_	jrib	y? what if i know what's in the folder?
2010-09-30T00:01:00.000Z	jrib	turgon_	based on what you tried.  Why exactly do you want to do this?
2010-09-30T00:02:00.000Z	turgon_	jrib	i have a folder containing configuration for mc, mocp etc... each one contains an executable file... in the main folder is a file called 'script' that calls the files in the subdirectories... they are not executable yet.. and i dont wana do it manually!
2010-09-30T00:02:00.000Z	jrib	turgon_	777 is not the proper way to do that
2010-09-30T00:04:00.000Z	jrib	turgon_	if you still aren't sure what you need to do, give more details (use a pastebin if you need to)
2010-09-30T00:04:00.000Z	turgon_	jrib	chmod -r 777 ./ does not work
2010-09-30T00:05:00.000Z	jrib	turgon_	I just said you didn't want to do that...
2010-09-30T00:05:00.000Z	turgon_	jrib	fine :D what to do then? :)
2010-09-30T00:05:00.000Z	jrib	turgon_	start by undoing what you did
2010-09-30T00:05:00.000Z	turgon_	jrib	done
2010-09-30T00:07:00.000Z	turgon_	jrib	thx :)
2010-09-30T00:07:00.000Z	jrib	turgon_	hmm?
2010-09-30T00:07:00.000Z	turgon_	jrib	i did chmod -r ./* ... the subdirectories became unaccessible :P
2010-09-30T00:08:00.000Z	turgon_	jrib	dont worry it fine :)
2010-09-30T00:08:00.000Z	jrib	turgon_	that's not a valid command
2010-09-30T00:08:00.000Z	jrib	turgon_	ok
2010-09-30T00:08:00.000Z	turgon_	jrib	though it worked :S
2010-09-30T00:08:00.000Z	jrib	turgon_	oh wait it is valid.  Okay makes sense
2010-09-30T00:08:00.000Z	turgon_	jrib	owww wait.... it made the files wx... how can i make them rwx ?
2010-09-30T00:09:00.000Z	jrib	turgon_	-R is recursive.  You're going to break things...
