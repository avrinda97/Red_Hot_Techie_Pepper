2010-08-24T17:23:00.000Z	itsux2bu		what was that keystroke to get a run box again?
2010-08-24T17:23:00.000Z	cypher-neo	itsux2bu	Alt-F2
2010-08-24T17:29:00.000Z	cypher-neo	itsux2bu	What desktop are you trying to start?
2010-08-24T17:31:00.000Z	itsux2bu	cypher-neo	sorry i meant to say..  how do i make it so the desktop doesn't start at boot time.. i'm using gnome..   'start gdm'  starts it manually..
2010-08-24T17:32:00.000Z	cypher-neo	itsux2bu	When you start up the computer, and you get to the log in page, there are a few things you can select on the bottom. All you need to do is select GDM, and it will start using that.
2010-08-24T17:34:00.000Z	itsux2bu	cypher-neo	 no.. i want to boot WITHOUT the desktop?  don't i need to edit some file at the command line level?
2010-08-24T17:36:00.000Z	cypher-neo	itsux2bu	No. You can do that from the log in page as well.
2010-08-24T17:36:00.000Z	cypher-neo	itsux2bu	It will boot to a Terminal command line
2010-08-24T17:36:00.000Z	cypher-neo	itsux2bu	One sec. I'm looking for the exact command now though to make it permanent
2010-08-24T17:37:00.000Z	itsux2bu	cypher-neo	i configured the desktop to not ask for a login.. it goes right into desktop..
2010-08-24T17:38:00.000Z	cypher-neo	itsux2bu	Oh. I always leave the password option on...
2010-08-24T17:39:00.000Z	cypher-neo	itsux2bu	In that case, you will need to edit a file... which can be a hassle.
2010-08-24T17:40:00.000Z	itsux2bu	cypher-neo	everything is a hassle in  *nix  but i've learned to live with it
2010-08-24T17:40:00.000Z	cypher-neo	itsux2bu	It would save you a lot of hassle if you just enabled the login page. On the login page you can use the menu option "Select Session" to boot into command line, or any other installed session.
2010-08-24T17:41:00.000Z	itsux2bu	cypher-neo	ok.. ok.. how do i do that?
2010-08-24T17:41:00.000Z	itsux2bu	cypher-neo	how do i turn on login screen
2010-08-24T17:42:00.000Z	cypher-neo	itsux2bu	Umm, try this. Hold down SHIFT to display the menu during boot
2010-08-24T17:43:00.000Z	cypher-neo	itsux2bu	So once the loading screen pops up, hold down Shift and the menu should display... I think.
2010-08-24T17:46:00.000Z	cypher-neo	itsux2bu	The only page I could find which comes close to what you are looking for is: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Common%20Boot%20Options
2010-08-24T17:47:00.000Z	itsux2bu	cypher-neo	it's got my login or  other
2010-08-24T17:47:00.000Z	itsux2bu	cypher-neo	i see not other choices
2010-08-24T17:48:00.000Z	cypher-neo	itsux2bu	It's at the bottom of the screen. There are options available for Location, Keyboard, and Session
