2009-11-06T00:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	lronic	if you are already logged in as root there is no need to "sudo" anything -- you're already root!
2009-11-06T00:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	lronic	try without sudo
2009-11-06T00:28:00.000Z	lronic	ZykoticK9	it still dont work
2009-11-06T00:29:00.000Z	lronic	ZykoticK9	-bash: gedit: command not found
2009-11-06T00:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	lronic	try logging in as a regular using
2009-11-06T00:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	lronic	s/using/user
2009-11-06T00:29:00.000Z	lronic	ZykoticK9	-bash: s/using/user: No such file or directory
2009-11-06T00:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	lronic	sorry - that was me correcting my typo -- try logging in as a regular using instead of as root
2009-11-06T00:30:00.000Z	lronic	ZykoticK9	how do i do that ?
2009-11-06T00:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	lronic	log in as a regular user?  are you running off of a livecd or something unusual?
2009-11-06T00:32:00.000Z	lronic	ZykoticK9	this is a server box
2009-11-06T00:32:00.000Z	lronic	ZykoticK9	let me tell you what happen,,i install tight vnc and every thing when i view it with vnc viewer i dont see the desktop all i see is a gray screen
2009-11-06T00:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	lronic	i don't think even server default to logging in as the root account -- can't you just log in as a user?  who is in the admin group?
2009-11-06T00:33:00.000Z	lronic	ZykoticK9	root
2009-11-06T00:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	lronic	sorry i can't help you.  good luck.
