2010-12-26T07:47:00.000Z	TheWarden		Merry Christmas
2010-12-26T07:48:00.000Z	TheWarden		I have an issue that is really bugging me. I altered my account in Ubunutu 10.10 to not prompt for a password. Now I can't login unless I go to the shell.
2010-12-26T07:48:00.000Z	TheWarden		I receive the following error message "Could not update ICEauthority file
2010-12-26T07:49:00.000Z	TheWarden		then I click the button and it shows "There is a problem with the config server /usb/libgconf2-4/gconf-sanity-check-2 exited with status 256)
2010-12-26T07:50:00.000Z	TheWarden		There must be something I can do to resolve this without having to re-install Ubuntu. It worked slick with no issues prior to me changing my account to not prompt for login password. Hell if I knew how to put it back I would.
2010-12-26T07:50:00.000Z	TheWarden		damn gui has gotten me confused
2010-12-26T07:50:00.000Z	TheWarden		yes I've tried google but so far no luck locating a solution.
2010-12-26T07:51:00.000Z	histo	TheWarden	system >admin > login screen
2010-12-26T07:52:00.000Z	histo	TheWarden	To re-enable the password that is.
2010-12-26T07:52:00.000Z	TheWarden	histo	Ahh I do that in the shell prompt? Remember I can't login via the GUI anymore.
2010-12-26T07:53:00.000Z	histo	TheWarden	what did you do under users and groups?
2010-12-26T07:54:00.000Z	TheWarden	histo	I set it to not prompt for password
2010-12-26T07:54:00.000Z	histo	TheWarden	you can't in there so I'm not quite sure what you did.
2010-12-26T08:32:00.000Z	histo	TheWarden	yeah it's only addition is part of the admin group
2010-12-26T08:33:00.000Z	TheWarden	histo	ahh okay so I should be able to just create another account with sudo permissions and apart of the admin group and all should be good. On the other hand in theory one would think I could go into my home directory and delete it all then
2010-12-26T08:33:00.000Z	TheWarden	histo	login via the GUI and it should work.
2010-12-26T08:33:00.000Z	histo	TheWarden	yeah you can create another account and just add them to admin group and it would be the same as the install does.
2010-12-26T08:34:00.000Z	TheWarden	histo	ahh okay perfect but I still have to grant sudo permissions right or does the admin group do that in Ubuntu?
2010-12-26T08:35:00.000Z	histo	TheWarden	yeah that's what the admin group is.
2010-12-26T08:36:00.000Z	TheWarden	histo	oh okay, great. Thanks.
2010-12-26T08:38:00.000Z	histo	TheWarden	i was trying to tell you about visudo if you look above I messaged theadmin by mistake
2010-12-26T08:45:00.000Z	histo	TheWarden	what's that?
