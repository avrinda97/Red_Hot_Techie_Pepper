2011-05-16T15:04:00.000Z	nancho		Hi, I'd like to know if to add space on the systme partition is possible.
2011-05-16T15:05:00.000Z	DasEi	nancho	if there is space before or behind can be freed, yes, else can have a new partiton, so yes
2011-05-16T15:06:00.000Z	DasEi	nancho	just make this your new /home and copy things over (move) ?!
2011-05-16T15:07:00.000Z	nancho	DasEi	but I havefirst to move the partition because they're not the one beside the other.
2011-05-16T15:08:00.000Z	DasEi	nancho	you could just use this 210gb for additional /home, tell it to fstab, mount it, copy - then delete your old data over, then delete old /home
2011-05-16T15:09:00.000Z	DasEi	nancho	just check by df -h in current home, space is enough
2011-05-16T15:11:00.000Z	nancho	DasEi	I do not speak about /home because my partition is used for data (who can be whitten and read on windows and linux)
2011-05-16T15:12:00.000Z	DasEi	nancho	you initally wanted more space, and said you got an additional partition, so my idea
2011-05-16T15:15:00.000Z	DasEi	nancho	depends, works only easily if it's next to your existing root
2011-05-16T15:16:00.000Z	nancho	DasEi	I thiunk I'll reinstall all the OS with at least 10 Gio.
2011-05-16T15:16:00.000Z	DasEi	nancho	run gparted an post a screenshot
2011-05-16T15:17:00.000Z	DasEi	nancho	/home is where all your personal stuff goes, and a 10G is not much for a whole os
2011-05-16T15:18:00.000Z	nancho	DasEi	I don't need a /home in fact because of my partition data (210 Gio is amply enough)
2011-05-16T15:18:00.000Z	DasEi	nancho	which size has your current root ?
2011-05-16T15:19:00.000Z	nancho	DasEi	what do you mean? The syst partition ?
2011-05-16T15:20:00.000Z	nancho	DasEi	where do you post a picture?
