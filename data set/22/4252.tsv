2008-02-26T03:02:00.000Z	_Oz_		how do I change the color of the desktop "panels" on the bottom taskbar? they default to an ugly tan/brown color and changing themes doesn't help?
2008-02-26T03:03:00.000Z	ere4si	_Oz_	right click the panel then select properties then the background tab
2008-02-26T03:04:00.000Z	_Oz_	ere4si	I do that but still don't see it!
2008-02-26T03:04:00.000Z	ere4si	_Oz_	then select solid colour
2008-02-26T03:04:00.000Z	_Oz_	ere4si	I'm talking about the desktop ICONS in the bottom right corner
2008-02-26T03:05:00.000Z	ere4si	_Oz_	for that you need a theme that does that for you
2008-02-26T03:06:00.000Z	_Oz_	ere4si	I've installed several different themes but that part never changes.
2008-02-26T03:06:00.000Z	ere4si	_Oz_	I installed a dark theme that did , so you need to find one that does that...
2008-02-26T03:07:00.000Z	_Oz_	ere4si	ok
2008-02-26T03:07:00.000Z	_Oz_	ere4si	thanks for trying to help
2008-03-01T02:44:00.000Z	ere4si	_Oz_	I copy a 700mb file from my server to a usb stick connected to my main pc in 1min20sec with 10/100
2008-03-01T02:45:00.000Z	_Oz_	ere4si	that seems faster than me
2008-03-01T02:45:00.000Z	ere4si	_Oz_	that's through a netgear router
2008-03-01T02:46:00.000Z	ere4si	_Oz_	is it wireless you're doing that with?
2008-03-01T02:46:00.000Z	_Oz_	ere4si	no
2008-03-01T18:39:00.000Z	ere4si	_Oz_	  top    in the terminal is the command - then hit   k   then type the pid
2008-03-01T18:39:00.000Z	_Oz_	ere4si	thanks
2008-03-01T18:40:00.000Z	ere4si	_Oz_	there is a panel app called force quit that I use for that - it's easier
2008-03-01T18:47:00.000Z	ere4si	_Oz_	I have disk usage analyser in my menu
2008-03-01T19:00:00.000Z	_Oz_	ere4si	how do you do it, man?  You're constantly here helping people.
2008-03-01T19:01:00.000Z	ere4si	_Oz_	just interested :)
2008-03-02T18:33:00.000Z	ere4si	_Oz_	gnome-panel - no "s" on the end
