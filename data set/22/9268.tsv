2011-06-14T21:22:00.000Z	user_		i'm trying to use /etc/fstab to auto mount by buffalo, i know this works, but i have just reinsatlled and now can't get it working. It shouldn't be this hard.  Any help please. Says special device does not exist. //192.168.1.210/data  /media/Data xfs guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8,codepage=unicode,unicode  0  0
2011-06-14T21:23:00.000Z	dr_willis_	user_	 you are using 'xfs' for a samba share? or nfs share?
2011-06-14T21:24:00.000Z	user_	dr_willis_	it's a xfs file type..
2011-06-14T21:24:00.000Z	dr_willis_	user_	 then where is the ///192.xx.xx/data comming from?
2011-06-14T21:25:00.000Z	user_	dr_willis_	it's a local network device. IP is correct and UNC is also correct including caps.
2011-06-14T21:27:00.000Z	user_	dr_willis_	I can mount by clicking it.. Can we do that then revirse engineer that?
2011-06-14T21:29:00.000Z	dr_willis_	user_	 so its being shared by what service?    i cant recall ever seeing xfs used that way
2011-06-14T21:30:00.000Z	dr_willis_	user_	 you are accessing it vya the network -> type address whats the url to it?  ctrl-l to show the address of the file manager once you are in a dir on the gizmo
2011-06-14T21:30:00.000Z	dr_willis_	user_	 like escott  is saying.. if its a SAMBA or NFS share - i dont think you  want to use the 'xfs' filetype.
2011-06-14T21:31:00.000Z	user_	dr_willis_	Well the format on the drive says xfs but i don't remember the setting from before. It looks like a SAMBA share
2011-06-14T21:31:00.000Z	dr_willis_	user_	 if its a samab share - it dosent matter WHAT the actual drive is formated to.. your remote box sees it as a 'samba' share..
2011-06-14T21:32:00.000Z	dr_willis_	user_	 so you want cifs or smbfs i think to mount it that way
2011-06-14T21:33:00.000Z	user_	dr_willis_	Wrong FS Type
2011-06-14T21:35:00.000Z	dr_willis_	user_	 you must insrtall the smbfs package also
2011-06-14T21:36:00.000Z	dr_willis_	user_	 i always use the ip - rarely if ever the servername..  unles si set up the hosts file to map name->ip
2011-06-14T21:37:00.000Z	user_	dr_willis_	YOU HIT IT !!!
2011-06-14T21:38:00.000Z	user_	dr_willis_	but i have warning: Warning: mapping 'guest' to 'guest,sec=none'
2011-06-14T21:38:00.000Z	user_	dr_willis_	Warning: ignoring deprecated smbfs option 'codepage=unicode'
2011-06-14T21:39:00.000Z	dr_willis_	user_	 read that wiki page i posted.. it details  some errors.. cifs has changed stuff differntly then smbfs
2011-06-14T21:40:00.000Z	user_	dr_willis_	did you write this wiki?
2011-06-14T21:40:00.000Z	dr_willis_	user_	 nope.
2011-06-14T21:46:00.000Z	dr_willis_	user_	 that would help. :)
