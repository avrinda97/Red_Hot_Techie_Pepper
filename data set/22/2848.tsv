2009-02-21T11:08:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian		what is the best way to keep two folders in ubuntu synchronized ( same copy of files and keep them updated) ?
2009-02-21T11:10:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian		can someone explain how i can use rsync ?
2009-02-21T11:12:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian		can someone tell me how i can set rsync to automatically back up a folder whenever changes are made ?
2009-02-21T11:13:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	you don't run it whenever something changes.  Your best bet is to make a cron entry
2009-02-21T11:15:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	check the link that ubottu posted about cron
2009-02-21T11:15:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	easiest way:  rsync -av /sourcedir /destdir
2009-02-21T11:17:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	cron is your best bet and you WILL want to learn it at some point
2009-02-21T11:18:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	you can simply share a directory on your unix box with Samba and then just view it over the share
2009-02-21T11:19:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	you can also use a program on Windows perhaps like UltraEdit that can open the file up over FTP so when you save it, it saves it right back to the server
2009-02-21T11:20:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	rsync will work fine
2009-02-21T11:21:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	but either cron or a startup script is your best bet
2009-02-21T11:22:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	once the sync is up and going, probably not, but it will do that ALL of the time, even when you're in the process of editing it
2009-04-04T07:10:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	have you tried restarting X after the change?
2009-04-04T07:10:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	Huufarted	how do i do that ?
2009-04-04T07:10:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	try Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
2009-04-04T07:11:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	IT WILL LOG YOU OUT, save your work first.
2009-04-04T07:11:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	or what gigabites2 said.  :)
2009-04-04T07:14:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	Huufarted	how else can i restart X ?
2009-04-04T07:15:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	the easiest way is to just do this from a terminal (because I'm lazy with describing GUI solutions):  sudo reboot  (will reboot your computer entirely)
2009-04-04T07:19:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	have you tried the 'Mouse' settings in your Preferences menu?
2009-04-04T07:20:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	Huufarted	yeah thats the first thing i said, that setting doesnt have any reflection on the device for some reason
2009-04-04T07:20:00.000Z	Huufarted	spaceBARbarian	sorry, I'm out of suggestions then.  I apologize
