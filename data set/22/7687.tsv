2006-02-20T13:04:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde		is there any way to verify that my PCMCIA slot is functional short of installing win32 as a test???
2006-02-20T13:04:00.000Z	setuid	KoruptidPryde	KNOPPIX
2006-02-20T13:04:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	setuid	any specific commands?
2006-02-20T13:04:00.000Z	setuid	KoruptidPryde	pop in a pcmcia card
2006-02-20T13:05:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	setuid	i'm on ubuntu and it doesn't seem to be recognizing
2006-02-20T13:05:00.000Z	setuid	KoruptidPryde	uhm... what?
2006-02-20T13:06:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	setuid	I'm running ubuntu.... I've put a card into my PCMCIA slot.... dmesg shows that it detects the card being inserted..... but i can't seem to pull up any information about the inserted card
2006-02-20T13:07:00.000Z	setuid	KoruptidPryde	perhaps its not a supported card?
2006-02-20T13:07:00.000Z	setuid	KoruptidPryde	perhaps you need a module loaded?
2006-02-20T13:07:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	setuid	that's what I'm trying to determine..... i've inserted two different linksys cards, but i currently don't have anything else i could insert in order to test
2006-02-20T13:08:00.000Z	setuid	KoruptidPryde	Try finding the right module, if it exists
2006-02-20T13:10:00.000Z	setuid	KoruptidPryde	If the card isnt' recognized, then you can't pull up info on it
2006-02-20T13:10:00.000Z	setuid	KoruptidPryde	tried cardinfo?
2006-02-20T13:11:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	setuid	what I'm trying to do is verify that the bus is functioning properly before I order a $70 PCMCIA wireless network adapter
2006-02-20T13:16:00.000Z	setuid	KoruptidPryde	Then it probably works
2006-02-20T13:16:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	setuid	but then why can't I see either of the two different and functional cards in lspci?
2006-02-20T13:17:00.000Z	setuid	KoruptidPryde	what makes you think the bus is broken?
2006-02-20T13:17:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	setuid	the fact that nothing shows up in lspci after inserting two different cards
2006-02-20T13:17:00.000Z	setuid	KoruptidPryde	did you install the driver/module for those cards?
2006-02-20T13:18:00.000Z	setuid	KoruptidPryde	Try a card that Linux supports
2006-02-20T13:19:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	setuid	I can't without buying one... and I don't want to buy one if it turns out my bus is bad
2006-02-20T13:19:00.000Z	setuid	KoruptidPryde	Go to an electronics store (Radio Shack? Apple Store) and bring your laptop, plug in a card, and see if it sees it
