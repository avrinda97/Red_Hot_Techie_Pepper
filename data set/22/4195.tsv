2008-10-01T18:20:00.000Z	extor		Are there any plans to enable selinux extensions by default in the next ubuntu release, like fedora has done already?
2008-10-01T18:20:00.000Z	jim_p	extor	do you really need selinux?
2008-10-01T18:21:00.000Z	extor	jim_p	not sure but it sounds really sexy and "must have"
2008-10-01T18:21:00.000Z	jim_p	extor	nonsense. selinux is something to be used by companies and stuff. no benefit for the simple user
2008-10-01T18:22:00.000Z	extor	jim_p	doesn't a simple user want to be safe from online threats?
2008-10-01T18:23:00.000Z	jim_p	extor	that is what firewalls are for, and iptables is perfect for thet job.
2008-10-01T18:25:00.000Z	jim_p	extor	go here and look at the pic http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selinux . are you a large company that needs policies and stuff?
2008-10-01T18:26:00.000Z	jim_p	extor	it is definitely useless for the simple user
2008-10-01T18:40:00.000Z	jim_p	extor	i dont know. i have used it once to recover some deleted photos from a CF card
2008-10-22T13:46:00.000Z	jim_p	extor	killall gnome-panel
2008-10-22T13:46:00.000Z	extor	jim_p	it is still blank
2008-10-22T13:47:00.000Z	jim_p	extor	the panel is there but it does not have open windows listed?
2008-10-22T13:47:00.000Z	extor	jim_p	correct
2008-10-22T13:49:00.000Z	jim_p	extor	right click on an empty panel area and "add to panel" > "window selection" maybe (i am in greek and i dont know if its correct translation)
2008-10-22T13:50:00.000Z	extor	jim_p	I have a window selectOR not selection...I tried it but it just added an x-chat icon to the bottom panel which is otherwise blank
2008-10-22T13:51:00.000Z	jim_p	extor	let me make a new panel to find what it is
2008-10-22T13:51:00.000Z	jim_p	extor	window list ??
2008-10-22T13:52:00.000Z	extor	jim_p	that did it. They look a bit odd but yeah they are back
2008-10-22T13:52:00.000Z	jim_p	extor	right click > add to panel > window list ??
2008-10-22T13:52:00.000Z	extor	jim_p	yeah that worked
2008-10-24T12:46:00.000Z	jim_p	extor	try to run apt-cdrom with the cdrom unmounted
2008-10-24T12:48:00.000Z	extor	jim_p	had to trick it by mounting it in another tty just before hitting enter
