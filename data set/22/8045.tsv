2010-04-27T19:25:00.000Z	mark1		so this is a random question, ... does any one know if i can make a folder hidden in linux, (but the windows attribute hidden - not putting a period before the name)
2010-04-27T19:26:00.000Z	mark1		no its not possible ?
2010-04-27T19:26:00.000Z	linxeh	mark1	assuming I understand you right - you want to hide a folder on linux that doesnt start with a . ?
2010-04-27T19:27:00.000Z	mark1	linxeh	yea i guess thats about right
2010-04-27T19:27:00.000Z	linxeh		so you want to make the folder "MyFolder" hidden ?
2010-04-27T19:28:00.000Z	mark1	linxeh	oer yea but the hardware im trying to hide the folder from doesnt register it as being hidden if it has a . in front of the name
2010-04-27T19:28:00.000Z	linxeh	mark1	file a bug with that software I guess, or move the folder somewhere else :o
2010-04-27T19:30:00.000Z	mark1	linxeh	the thing it , its not software its hardware, a media player to be more specific, and i need to be able to do this frequently and i cant just be moving 500GB folders on a daily bases
2010-04-27T19:31:00.000Z	linxeh	mark1	moving a folder to another folder is instant
2010-04-27T19:31:00.000Z	linxeh	mark1	assuming it is on the same filesystem
2010-04-27T19:31:00.000Z	mark1	linxeh	not when you have to move it from a portable hard drive
2010-04-27T19:31:00.000Z	mark1	linxeh	and not when its a 500GB folder
2010-04-27T19:31:00.000Z	linxeh	mark1	then thats not on the same filesystem
2010-04-27T19:32:00.000Z	linxeh	mark1	is this movable hard drive formatted fat32 ?
2010-04-27T19:32:00.000Z	mark1		no, ntfs
2010-04-27T19:32:00.000Z	mark1	linxeh	no ntfs
2010-04-27T19:32:00.000Z	linxeh	mark1	ok, then you can probably do what you want
2010-04-27T19:32:00.000Z	mark1	linxeh	got any clues how ?
2010-04-27T19:32:00.000Z	mark1		without restarting to windows ?
2010-04-27T19:33:00.000Z	linxeh	mark1	yeah, hang on
2010-04-27T19:33:00.000Z	mark1		thanks
2010-04-27T19:37:00.000Z	linxeh	mark1	hmm, I was hoping for a tool that manipulated the ntfs file attributes but I'm struggling to find one - the ntfsprogs tools dont appear to do the right things
