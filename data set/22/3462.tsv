2008-09-24T20:02:00.000Z	Neaai		When I check the "hardware drivers" I can see an entry for Athereos HAL and another one for Athereos 892.11 wireless lan card. Does that mean it has detected the wireless properly ?
2008-09-24T20:03:00.000Z	mgolisch	Neaai	not realy, it just means that the drivers have been enabled it doesnt realy mean the driver detected your card
2008-09-24T20:04:00.000Z	mgolisch	Neaai	dmesg|grep wifi
2008-09-24T20:04:00.000Z	mgolisch	Neaai	is there an error message from the atheros hal?
2008-09-24T20:04:00.000Z	Neaai	mgolisch	 wifi%d: unable to attach hardware: 'Hardware revision not supported' (HAL status 13)
2008-09-24T20:05:00.000Z	Neaai	mgolisch	seems like there's an error all right
2008-09-24T20:05:00.000Z	mgolisch	Neaai	yeah the hal doesnt support your card, what you can try is compiling the latest madwifi snapshot yourself, they have some snapshots that have a newer hal
2008-09-24T20:06:00.000Z	Neaai	mgolisch	I see. How equal are the ubuntu precompiled binaries against the source tree ?
2008-09-24T20:06:00.000Z	Neaai	mgolisch	I mean, if I got the source and just complied, would it give me the precomplied that ubuntu suplies ?
2008-09-24T20:11:00.000Z	mgolisch	Neaai	you would have to reinstall the selfbuild madwifi driver on each kernel update
2008-09-24T20:14:00.000Z	Neaai	mgolisch	That sucks a bit, having to recompile the kernel. But after all I'm thinking I don't need to follow every kernel update
2008-09-24T20:15:00.000Z	Neaai	mgolisch	once and if I have that running I guess I'll settle for that kernel revision
2008-09-24T20:15:00.000Z	Neaai	mgolisch	And moreover, recompliling the kernel on my own might mess up the nVidia drivers
2008-09-24T20:16:00.000Z	mgolisch	Neaai	its basicaly just change to the directory you downlaoded the source to, make clean;make sudo make install then reboot and it should work again
2008-09-24T20:16:00.000Z	Neaai	mgolisch	I fear I won't be able to use the nVidia drivers, which I currently use from the stock kernel binaries
2008-09-24T20:17:00.000Z	mgolisch	Neaai	sure you can, its just compiling your own kernelmodules for madwifi, you dont need to build a custom kernel for that
2008-09-24T20:27:00.000Z	Neaai	mgolisch	I see that my installation has included the package "linux-headers-2.6.24-19 which is what I currently use. Would these sufice for compling the madwifi module and HAL ?
2008-09-24T20:28:00.000Z	mgolisch	Neaai	yeah just install build-essential package and make sure the linux-header package matching your running kernel is installed, and of course download one of the snapshots that contain the newer hal
2008-09-24T20:29:00.000Z	Neaai	mgolisch	ok I'll do that. So I'm away now compiling-in-attempt :D
2008-09-24T20:37:00.000Z	Neaai	mgolisch	Compiling went flawless. In the madwifi.tar.gz there was an INSTALL file that showed a way to insert the modules created. But I gather I'd have to unload the current modules first. Is it enough to uncheck the Athereos HAL and the Athereos 802.11 entries in Administration->Hardware Drivers ?
2008-09-24T20:38:00.000Z	mgolisch	Neaai	uncheck those, but the make install target should unlaod them automaticaly usualy
2008-09-24T20:39:00.000Z	Neaai	mgolisch	Ah I see. Well anyhow I'll have to go eat first before my food break is over and then I'll continue. Thanks for the help so far mgolisch. :)
