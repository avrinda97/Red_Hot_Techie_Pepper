2008-01-31T00:55:00.000Z	Boglizk		My sound has started to act up when playing with Firefox (flash) or an audio-player. But not with mplayer.
2008-01-31T00:56:00.000Z	Boglizk		I only have one soundcard.
2008-01-31T00:56:00.000Z	crimsun	Boglizk	gutsy?
2008-01-31T00:56:00.000Z	crimsun	Boglizk	are you using alsa directly?
2008-01-31T00:56:00.000Z	Boglizk	crimsun	I think so.
2008-01-31T00:57:00.000Z	crimsun	Boglizk	does closing all other audio apps before starting Firefox to view a Flash applet work?
2008-01-31T00:59:00.000Z	crimsun	Boglizk	are you referring to quality-wise?
2008-01-31T00:59:00.000Z	crimsun	Boglizk	what level is PCM set to?
2008-01-31T00:59:00.000Z	Boglizk	crimsun	No idea, where do i check that?
2008-01-31T01:00:00.000Z	crimsun	Boglizk	using any mixer utility, e.g., amixer, alsamixer, aumix, the speaker icon in the upper right corner of the top panel in GNOME, ...
2008-01-31T01:01:00.000Z	Boglizk	crimsun	The sound level is 100% percent, if thats what  you were meaning.
2008-01-31T01:02:00.000Z	crimsun	Boglizk	too high.  Try decreasing it to < 50%.
2008-01-31T01:02:00.000Z	Boglizk	crimsun	Wow, that worked. Thanks alot
2008-02-03T04:00:00.000Z	crimsun	Boglizk	then you'll need to use the update-fonts* utilities.
2008-02-03T03:43:00.000Z	crimsun	Boglizk	drop it into ~/.fonts/, run `sudo fc-cache -f -v` in a terminal, then close and reopen whichever font selector.
2008-02-03T03:44:00.000Z	crimsun	Boglizk	so the question is about configuring wireless on your Ubuntu install?  Which Ubuntu release?
2008-02-03T03:51:00.000Z	Boglizk	crimsun	I tried what you told me (the font thing), but it doesn't work. I have the font in both .pcf and .fon-format, neither shows up.
2008-02-03T03:52:00.000Z	crimsun	Boglizk	that's for TrueType format.
2008-02-03T03:52:00.000Z	Boglizk	crimsun	So.. is there any solution?
2008-02-03T03:53:00.000Z	crimsun	Boglizk	do you have the font in TT format?
2008-02-03T03:53:00.000Z	Boglizk	crimsun	No, i have it in .fon and .pcf. It wasn't available in ttf.
2008-02-03T04:00:00.000Z	crimsun	Boglizk	see their respective man pages
