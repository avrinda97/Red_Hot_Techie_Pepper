2007-05-16T11:09:00.000Z	RedACE		Why isn't my clock automatically being synced to a time server?
2007-05-16T11:10:00.000Z	PriceChild	RedACE	that isn't set up by default afaik
2007-05-16T11:10:00.000Z	RedACE	PriceChild	that's silly
2007-05-16T11:10:00.000Z	PriceChild	RedACE	why?
2007-05-16T11:10:00.000Z	PriceChild	RedACE	it involves installing more packages (easily done via gui)
2007-05-16T11:10:00.000Z	RedACE	PriceChild	why would you not synchronize?
2007-05-16T11:10:00.000Z	PriceChild	RedACE	because you haven't got the internet?
2007-05-16T11:11:00.000Z	RedACE	PriceChild	so then the synchronization fails. It should still try by default
2007-05-16T11:11:00.000Z	PriceChild	RedACE	if you can synchronise you can quickly dl a couple of packages which would have taken up space ont he cd
2007-05-16T11:11:00.000Z	RedACE	PriceChild	I'm saying it should be default
2007-05-16T11:11:00.000Z	RedACE	PriceChild	by your login, ubuntu should do nothing and come with no software by default and the user should have to know to install everything.
2007-05-16T11:12:00.000Z	PriceChild	RedACE	ubuntu has a big "one cd install" thing going on.
2007-05-16T11:13:00.000Z	PriceChild	RedACE	Its about 3 or 4 clicks and a password to get that working.
2007-06-01T14:30:00.000Z	PriceChild	RedACE	please stay on topic.
2007-06-04T07:10:00.000Z	PriceChild	RedACE	that is not recommended. /msg ubotu upgrade
2007-06-04T07:10:00.000Z	RedACE	PriceChild	are you kidding?
2007-06-04T07:11:00.000Z	PriceChild	RedACE	I am not no.
2007-06-04T07:11:00.000Z	PriceChild	RedACE	ubuntu != ubuntu
2007-06-04T07:11:00.000Z	PriceChild	RedACE	please "/msg ubotu upgrade" and read the recommended method.
2007-06-04T07:15:00.000Z	PriceChild	RedACE	its not broken, its just safer to use the upgrade-manager tools
2007-06-04T07:16:00.000Z	PriceChild	RedACE	that's fine
2007-06-04T07:16:00.000Z	PriceChild	RedACE	only when upgrade distributions is it highly recommended to use upgrade-manager
