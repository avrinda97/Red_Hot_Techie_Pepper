2010-08-26T04:30:00.000Z	ComradeHaz`		Hi all, has a fix for the nvidia GT220 fan not being slowed by the drivers been found yet?
2010-08-26T04:30:00.000Z	ComradeHaz`		On just about all nvidia cards, yes.
2010-08-26T04:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ComradeHaz`	tried the 356 driver?
2010-08-26T04:32:00.000Z	ComradeHaz`	ActionParsnip	what do you mean by 356?
2010-08-26T04:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ComradeHaz`	sorry, 256
2010-08-26T04:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ComradeHaz`	ok, thats cool
2010-08-26T04:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ComradeHaz`	log a bug
2010-08-26T04:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ComradeHaz`	or you can try the driver from the nvidia site itself

2010-09-19T01:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ComradeHaz`	because people were losing work or something. I have no idea.
2010-09-19T01:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ComradeHaz`	i know, go figure

2010-09-19T02:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ComradeHaz`	windows is a different OS so what it does or doesnt do is of zero value
2010-09-19T02:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ComradeHaz`	very unlikely as you can see the bootup before the OS even loads
2010-09-19T02:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ComradeHaz`	the system wont even POST if the GPU is fried
2010-09-19T23:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ComradeHaz`	history | grep sudo
2011-09-23T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ComradeHaz`	ask and see
2011-09-23T15:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ComradeHaz`	try:  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install ubiquity gparted      then try the installation
2011-09-23T15:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ComradeHaz`	I assume you have web access. You will need to do this in the 'test ubuntu' desktop
2011-09-23T15:46:00.000Z	ComradeHaz`	ActionParsnip	Think maybe I explained badly. I'm running a live 'install' and partitioning disks from there.
2011-09-23T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ComradeHaz`	yes, you can still update the apps in the live environment, the changes just dont stick between reboots
2011-09-23T15:47:00.000Z	ComradeHaz`	ActionParsnip	oh, sure, I know, but I don't think the latest version is in the repo's.. Let me try an upgrade though. DIdn't think of that
