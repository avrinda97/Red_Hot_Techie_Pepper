2008-02-18T15:31:00.000Z	ikonia	msdtux	ubuntu --> Microsoft = One setup/think mircrosoft --> ubuntu = totally different thing
2008-02-18T15:33:00.000Z	ikonia	msdtux	can you explain your problem, are you trying to get windows to connect to an ubuntu server, or ubuntu to connect to a window server
2008-02-18T15:34:00.000Z	msdtux	ikonia	I´m trying to connect to windows client from ubuntu.
2008-02-18T15:34:00.000Z	ikonia	msdtux	where is the share you want to connect to, is the share on the windows machine, or the ubuntu machine
2008-02-18T15:35:00.000Z	msdtux	ikonia	the share is on windows machine.
2008-02-18T15:35:00.000Z	ikonia	msdtux	ok - so how are you trying to connect
2008-02-18T15:36:00.000Z	msdtux	ikonia	I´m typing smb://192.168.1.17 in the location bar of nautilus.  192.168.1.17 is my windows machine.
2008-02-18T15:36:00.000Z	ikonia	msdtux	and do you have "smbclient" installed ?
2008-02-18T15:37:00.000Z	ikonia	msdtux	and "smbfs"
2008-02-18T15:37:00.000Z	msdtux	ikonia	smbfs and smbclient is already the newest version.
2008-02-18T15:38:00.000Z	ikonia	msdtux	and it was installed from the ubuntu repo
2008-02-18T15:38:00.000Z	ikonia	msdtux	does your "linux" username match the windows username on the windows share ?
2008-02-18T15:38:00.000Z	ikonia	msdtux	do you have basic connection to the windows machine (can you ping it etc)
2008-02-18T15:39:00.000Z	msdtux	ikonia	yes... both using the same username and password...
2008-02-18T15:39:00.000Z	msdtux	ikonia	I can ping from ubuntu to windows machine, and I can connect from windows machine to ubuntu share...
2008-02-18T15:39:00.000Z	ikonia	msdtux	have you tried mounting it from the command line or from teh "connect to" gui
2008-02-18T15:41:00.000Z	msdtux	ikonia	I haven´t try to mount it using command line...
2008-02-18T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	msdtux	try the "connect to " gui in "places"
2008-02-18T15:42:00.000Z	msdtux	ikonia	what do you mean by ¨connect to ¨ gui....
2008-02-18T15:42:00.000Z	msdtux	ikonia	do you mean, at places --> connect to server ?
2008-02-18T15:51:00.000Z	msdtux	ikonia	its not working (places --> connect to server...)
