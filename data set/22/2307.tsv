2009-08-05T09:27:00.000Z	wcryer		anyone know how to fix an ethernet card that has the correct driver but no ip address
2009-08-05T09:27:00.000Z	mechtech	wcryer	ifconfig
2009-08-05T09:28:00.000Z	wcryer	mechtech	what can i tell from that, im really new to linux
2009-08-05T09:29:00.000Z	wcryer	mechtech	under eth0:avahi it shows a self assigned ip
2009-08-05T09:30:00.000Z	mechtech	wcryer	open a command terminal and you can read the man pages (manual pages) by typing "man whatever" then enter
2009-08-05T09:30:00.000Z	mechtech	wcryer	you want to learn about "interfaces", "ifconfig" and "iwconfig" for wireless
2009-08-05T09:31:00.000Z	mechtech	wcryer	btw...what ip address do you have?
2009-08-05T09:32:00.000Z	wcryer	mechtech	the one it shows for the eth0:avahi is 169.....that business and in the graphic interface it just shows zeros for everything
2009-08-05T09:32:00.000Z	mechtech	wcryer	you mean the gui "Network Manager"?
2009-08-05T09:33:00.000Z	wcryer	mechtech	i dont think its network manager it is just the basic lower right thing in mint
2009-08-05T09:34:00.000Z	mechtech	wcryer	not familiar with mint...does it look like wifi signal strength bars?
2009-08-05T09:35:00.000Z	wcryer	mechtech	it looks like a LAN in windows, overlapping screens
2009-08-05T09:35:00.000Z	mechtech	wcryer	click on it and tell me what you see
2009-08-05T09:37:00.000Z	wcryer	mechtech	i see how retarded i am, ive been fricken right clicking this entire time
2009-08-05T09:37:00.000Z	wcryer	mechtech	even have my wireless card now, fml
2009-08-05T09:37:00.000Z	mechtech		any body know why when I add a song to a playlist in VLC, the durations reads 0:00 and the file won't play?
2009-08-05T09:37:00.000Z	wcryer		thanks
2009-08-05T09:38:00.000Z	mechtech	wcryer	no problem?
2009-08-05T09:38:00.000Z	mechtech		wcryer...meant .
2009-08-05T09:39:00.000Z	wcryer	mechtech	yeah im good, thanks for your help, any pointers on setting up samba and whatever the print server thing is called
2009-08-05T09:39:00.000Z	mechtech		mezguitale: yes...I can play the files if I open the file itself, and I've been making playlists for days already, just suddenly today I can't
2009-08-05T09:43:00.000Z	mechtech	wcryer	don't know much about samba...haven't used it, but the CUPS setup is what you want for setting up your printer...you'll need the ip address if your printer is networked, and for multi function devices, you'll most definitely need the appropriate software
