2006-11-09T17:02:00.000Z	SpAc		Hi, can someone point me to a good howto on running up a multiboot (Win + Ubuntu) on a single drive?
2006-11-09T17:04:00.000Z	SpAc		thanks everyone... so then it wouldn't be hard to run 2 distro's of linux + win?
2006-11-09T17:05:00.000Z	SpAc		Hey, I'm switching to Linux! :) Just keeping win on there for those 1 or two windows things ;)
2006-11-09T17:06:00.000Z	AlienX	SpAc	i would suggest using dapper if you're going to switch from windows to ubuntu
2006-11-09T17:07:00.000Z	AlienX	SpAc	Dapper is much more stable and edgy still hasn't gotten all of the kinks worked out as far as hardware detection goes.
2006-11-09T17:07:00.000Z	SpAc	AlienX	ok, even though it is the latest stable release?
2006-11-09T17:08:00.000Z	AlienX	SpAc	absolutely. Dapper really isn't much different from Edgy and it's quite a bit more stable.
2006-11-09T17:09:00.000Z	AlienX	SpAc	well, you can take my advice or leave it but I've been around for a while and would like to think I have a good idea what I'm talking about :)
2006-11-09T17:10:00.000Z	SpAc	AlienX	I don't doubt it! I'm the one seeking your advice. I was just commenting on how unstable windows is for me
2006-11-09T17:11:00.000Z	AlienX	SpAc	yeah, I'm not a fan of windows myself and haven't run it in several years. If you're new to linux, you're going to want something that's a bit easier to use and more stable than Edgy in my opinion.
2006-11-09T17:12:00.000Z	SpAc	AlienX	Ok. I've been looking around for some time, and I really like the look of Ubuntu. I've been using it on and off on another machine. But I've decided to take the plunge and move to Linux on my main desktop
2006-11-09T17:13:00.000Z	SpAc	AlienX	I'm not a total newbie to Linux. I've been running a debian server for a few years now. That's been really handy in getting to know your way around the console.
2006-11-09T17:13:00.000Z	AlienX	SpAc	ubuntu is great. I highly suggest giving it a go. I've used several distros over the years and this is the one which I most prefer at the moment.
2006-11-09T17:14:00.000Z	AlienX	SpAc	as an example. Edgy doesn't like my external HDD which was never any issue in dapper but the new hardware detection tool isn't exactly ready for mainstream yet IMO
2006-11-09T17:15:00.000Z	AlienX	SpAc	I'm probably not a good person to ask about fedora. I don't play nicely with it
2006-11-09T17:16:00.000Z	SpAc	AlienX	Not a fan huh!
2006-11-09T17:16:00.000Z	AlienX	SpAc	not particularly. Many people absolutely love it but I've never much gotten along with fedora.
2006-11-09T17:17:00.000Z	SpAc	AlienX	Was thinking of running up a copy of that too
2006-11-09T17:17:00.000Z	AlienX	SpAc	my advice is to try out  several distros and find out which one(s) you like the most
2006-11-09T17:17:00.000Z	SpAc	AlienX	I was going to put on the 64 version of Ubuntu. Wise idea?... yes... I have a 64bit machine
2006-11-09T17:18:00.000Z	AlienX	SpAc	I have no idea as I don't run a 64 bit machine
2006-11-09T17:18:00.000Z	AlienX	SpAc	you could ask on the ubuntu forum. It's pretty good and many people offer great advice
