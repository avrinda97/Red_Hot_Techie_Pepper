2008-01-08T14:07:00.000Z	atm0sph	MicronXD	is that dbus a part of gatreamer or no?
2008-01-08T14:07:00.000Z	atm0sph	MicronXD	sorry I dont know then.

2008-01-08T14:08:00.000Z	MicronXD	atm0sph	I'm using knoppix
2008-01-08T14:08:00.000Z	atm0sph	MicronXD	why do you need to update dbus then?>  is something not working?
2008-01-08T14:08:00.000Z	MicronXD	atm0sph	i did "apt-get install dbus"
2008-01-08T14:09:00.000Z	MicronXD	atm0sph	but it said i have the latest version
2008-01-08T14:09:00.000Z	MicronXD	atm0sph	then when I tried to install "bluez-utils", its says I don't have dbus 0.35 or newer
2008-01-08T14:10:00.000Z	MicronXD	atm0sph	so i believe apt-get is looking for dbus on the disc
2008-01-08T14:10:00.000Z	atm0sph	MicronXD	apt-get should be looking at url's
2008-01-08T14:10:00.000Z	MicronXD	atm0sph	but I'm not sure how to get "apt-get" to look on the web
2008-01-08T14:12:00.000Z	MicronXD	atm0sph	eek idk
2008-01-08T14:13:00.000Z	atm0sph	MicronXD	type gedit /etc/apt/sources.list &
