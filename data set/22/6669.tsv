2007-07-03T08:29:00.000Z	peepsalot		not sure though
2007-07-03T08:29:00.000Z	peepsalot		it's only 100mb /boot
2007-07-03T08:31:00.000Z	peepsalot		i'm not sure which things I can safely delete from /boot
2007-07-03T08:33:00.000Z	peepsalot		ok down to 44m yay
2007-07-03T08:35:00.000Z	peepsalot		feisty has nvidia drivers in repos now?
2007-07-03T08:36:00.000Z	peepsalot		how can i get nvidia drivers installed so that every kernel update does not break x?
2007-07-03T08:37:00.000Z	macogw	peepsalot	if the drivers arent in the repos and linux-restricted-modules, you can't.
2007-07-03T08:37:00.000Z	macogw	peepsalot	youll have to recompile on each kernel upgrade
2007-07-03T08:38:00.000Z	peepsalot	macogw	i think the drivers are in the repos, i'm just not sure what package i need
2007-07-03T08:57:00.000Z	macogw	peepsalot	what driver do you use?
2007-07-03T08:58:00.000Z	peepsalot	macogw	just whatever the latest nvidia driver is
2007-07-03T08:58:00.000Z	macogw	peepsalot	is it nvidia-glx or nvidia-glx-new or nvidia-glx-legacy?
2007-07-03T08:59:00.000Z	macogw	peepsalot	or is it something else?
2007-07-03T08:59:00.000Z	peepsalot	macogw	well, previously i was using the install file from the nvidia site, and just now i was trying to use nvidia-glx.  it looks like i also have nvidia-common installed
2007-07-03T08:59:00.000Z	macogw	peepsalot	what card is it?
2007-07-03T09:00:00.000Z	peepsalot	macogw	not sure exactly, it's a laptop, couple years old.
2007-07-03T09:00:00.000Z	macogw	peepsalot	do "lspci" and see what it is
2007-07-03T09:01:00.000Z	peepsalot	macogw	NVIDIA Quadro FX Go700 rev a1
2007-07-03T09:02:00.000Z	peepsalot	macogw	i never use the "legacy" drivers, just the regular ones from nvidia always worked fine.  it's just annoying to reinstall after every update
2007-07-03T09:03:00.000Z	macogw	peepsalot	legacy wont work.  your card's newer.
2007-07-03T09:03:00.000Z	macogw	peepsalot	nvidia-glx-new *should* work
2007-07-03T09:08:00.000Z	peepsalot	macogw	nvidia-glx-new does not seem to work either
