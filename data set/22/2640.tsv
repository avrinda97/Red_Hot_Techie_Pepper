2009-08-23T02:33:00.000Z	nmvictor		hi, i have placed a folder abs_guide which contains .html files including index.html in /var/www.However,when i point my browser to http://localhost/abs_guide/index,html, i get apache2 claims that i do not have permissions to access that page?why is this the case?
2009-08-23T02:34:00.000Z	Flannel	nmvictor	apache runs as the user www-data, make sure your files are readable by www-data
2009-08-23T02:35:00.000Z	nmvictor	Flannel	how do i do that?
2009-08-23T02:36:00.000Z	Flannel	nmvictor	The easiest (short term) way is to make them world readable.
2009-08-23T02:40:00.000Z	nmvictor	Flannel	thanks, it did work.That was easy...
2010-06-05T01:41:00.000Z	Flannel	nmvictor	How did you set the term variable?
2010-06-05T01:41:00.000Z	nmvictor	Flannel	it must have been set by ubuntu, i have never set it
2010-06-05T01:43:00.000Z	nmvictor	Flannel	were you going to help?
2010-06-05T01:43:00.000Z	Flannel	nmvictor	Oh, I'm sorry, I read that as you've already tried and it wasn't working.  Alright.  Do you want xterm-256colors or xterm-256colors-bce?
2010-06-05T01:44:00.000Z	nmvictor	Flannel	xterm-256colors
2010-06-05T01:46:00.000Z	Flannel	nmvictor	Alright, you want to add that to your ~/.profile (or ~/.bash_profile if .profile doesn't exist), to the top, add: export TERM=xterm-256colors
2010-06-05T01:46:00.000Z	Flannel	nmvictor	If you just want to set it temporarily (for this session) just use `TERM=xterm-256colors` at your prompt before running the other commands
2010-06-05T01:47:00.000Z	nmvictor	Flannel	thanks, will the latter require a reboot
2010-06-05T01:47:00.000Z	Flannel	nmvictor	Usually it's a terminal that sets it though, not your bashrc/bash profile
2010-06-05T01:47:00.000Z	Flannel	nmvictor	So, check your terminal options to see if you can set it there, that's the better way to do it
2010-06-05T01:48:00.000Z	Flannel	nmvictor	If you just use the TERM=xterm-256color at your prompt, no you don't need to restart, and it also won't save if you exit this session
2010-06-05T01:49:00.000Z	nmvictor	Flannel	gnome terminal doesnt seem to have that capability
2010-06-05T01:50:00.000Z	Flannel	nmvictor	Which capability?
2010-06-05T01:50:00.000Z	nmvictor	Flannel	to set the TERM variable as you had suggested
2010-06-05T01:51:00.000Z	Flannel	nmvictor	Which method?
2010-06-05T02:24:00.000Z	nmvictor	Flannel	I did that, and then `echo $TERM` and it still echoe xterm, i rebooted, no difference.what could be the problem?
