2006-10-23T14:55:00.000Z	NeoThermic		my ubuntu CD got so hot during install that it has melted the CD pen writing off
2006-10-23T14:55:00.000Z	NeoThermic		ah, crap. I've just installed ubuntu, and I get the message: Hard disk boot sector invalid
2006-10-23T14:57:00.000Z	NeoThermic		eeep, what went wrong? :|
2006-10-23T14:57:00.000Z	NeoThermic		ok, I don't think grub or equivalent was installed, any help on checking if it was and if not, how to install it?
2006-10-23T14:58:00.000Z	Flannel	NeoThermic	the first link there tells you how to reinstall (yes, its for recovering from windows, but how it got uninstalled isnt important)
2006-10-23T15:03:00.000Z	NeoThermic	Flannel	those instructions didn't appear to work, upon booting the disk up I do not get an area to type anything, yet alone a boot: prompt. I can, however, use the CD to boot into the HD install of ubuntu; is there anything I can do from there?
2006-10-23T15:03:00.000Z	Flannel	NeoThermic	that's for the Alternate CD, you want the LiveCD/Desktop instructions
2006-10-23T15:04:00.000Z	NeoThermic	Flannel	ah :)
2006-10-23T15:06:00.000Z	NeoThermic	Flannel	I'm still a bit out of my depth here :S
2006-10-23T15:06:00.000Z	Flannel	NeoThermic	You know where you have them in linux? (hda1, hdb5, etc?)
2006-10-23T15:07:00.000Z	NeoThermic	Flannel	yeah, I can pull up `mount` to tell me
2006-10-23T15:07:00.000Z	Flannel	NeoThermic	and /boot?
2006-10-23T15:08:00.000Z	Flannel	NeoThermic	then /boot is inside of /, so your boot partition is on hda1, which in grub speak is 0,0
2006-10-23T15:08:00.000Z	Flannel	NeoThermic	so, either hd(0,0) or hda1, depending on where you're inputting it
2006-10-23T15:09:00.000Z	Flannel	NeoThermic	yes
2006-10-23T15:09:00.000Z	Flannel	NeoThermic	whatever that howto says... I don't have it memorized ;)  but, talking to grub, (hd0,0), to linux: hda1
2006-10-23T15:11:00.000Z	NeoThermic	Flannel	ace, I hope this works :)
2006-10-23T15:12:00.000Z	NeoThermic	Flannel	no dice, same message on boot.
2006-10-23T15:13:00.000Z	Flannel	NeoThermic	you followed those instructions on how to reinstall grub? but it didn't reinstall?
2006-10-23T15:13:00.000Z	NeoThermic	Flannel	grub said it succeeded in install
2006-10-23T15:13:00.000Z	Flannel	NeoThermic	what error does it give you on boot?
