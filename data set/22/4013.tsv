2008-12-24T10:23:00.000Z	stan		whats the linux firewall called?
2008-12-24T10:23:00.000Z	dmsuperman	stan	iptables ?
2008-12-24T10:26:00.000Z	stan	dmsuperman	pics or it didnt happen
2008-12-24T10:29:00.000Z	stan	dmsuperman	whats that white thing?  doesnt it cause cancer? (on the left, is that a 17", 19" wide?)
2008-12-24T10:29:00.000Z	dmsuperman	stan	mysticdarkhack: Then the 22" wide and 17" full LCDs on the left are my main monitors, I have 5 workspaces running on those
2008-12-24T10:30:00.000Z	stan	dmsuperman	thats depressing.. a 17" is about the same size as a 22" wide (the 22 is wider, naturally)
2008-12-24T10:30:00.000Z	dmsuperman	stan	That's the whole point of a widescreen, it's not supposed to be that much taller :P
2008-12-24T10:31:00.000Z	stan	dmsuperman	dont mind me.. i just bought a 37" lcd tv and realized its not any bigger than a 30" tv for most stuff :(
2008-12-24T10:31:00.000Z	dmsuperman	stan	Yeah, TVs as monitors are pretty pointless
2008-12-24T10:31:00.000Z	stan	dmsuperman	what mobo do you have that runs two cards at 16x?  Most run the primary at 16, the secondary at 8x
2008-12-24T10:31:00.000Z	dmsuperman	stan	You don't get any more pixel area than a 24"
2008-12-24T10:31:00.000Z	stan	dmsuperman	but to play dvds -- super useful.
2008-12-24T10:32:00.000Z	dmsuperman	stan	2x16x :)
2008-12-24T10:32:00.000Z	dmsuperman	stan	XFX 780i SLI something-or-other

2008-12-24T10:36:00.000Z	dmsuperman	stan	When I sit on my couch, I can control XBMC with it :D
2008-12-24T10:37:00.000Z	stan	dmsuperman	how is XBMC under Linux?  My xbox just died.. and I <3<3<3 xmbc.. but it couldnt handle highdef rips.. and now I have this 1080p 37" tv... and a core duo laptop w/ no lcd....
2008-12-24T10:37:00.000Z	dmsuperman	stan	They ported it like almost 2 months ago :D
2008-12-24T10:37:00.000Z	stan	dmsuperman	can you just throw anything at it like xmbc on the xbox?
2008-12-24T10:38:00.000Z	dmsuperman	stan	Yeah, it even reads ISOs like normal DVDs and reads videos out of archives :O
