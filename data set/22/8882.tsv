2005-09-23T15:45:00.000Z	kuru		okay guys.. I just upgraded some things from hoary to breezy
2005-09-23T15:45:00.000Z	kuru		and X died
2005-09-23T15:45:00.000Z	kuru		seems that it's a common problem, but none of the fixes on the forums seem to do it for me
2005-09-23T15:45:00.000Z	kuru		could not open default font 'fixed';
2005-09-23T15:45:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	kuru	: dist-upgrade, not some things...
2005-09-23T15:45:00.000Z	kuru	lsuactiafner	all i wanted was hpijs and hplip
2005-09-23T15:46:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	kuru	: something compiled for breezy wont work on your system, different glibc as far as i understand.
2005-09-23T15:46:00.000Z	kuru	lsuactiafner	I can understand the glibc stuff.. which was upgrded..
2005-09-23T15:47:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	kuru	: if you want those apps compile from from source next time
2005-09-23T15:47:00.000Z	kuru	lsuactiafner	hardly a reasonable way to do things
2005-09-23T15:47:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	kuru	: but right now your xorg aint compiled for the new glibc aint it?
2005-09-23T15:47:00.000Z	kuru	lsuactiafner	so it did upgrade it.. makes sense
2005-09-23T15:47:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	kuru	: 2 source packages do not take any time @ all.
2005-09-23T15:47:00.000Z	kuru	lsuactiafner	not sure why the fonts are not able to open though
2005-09-23T15:47:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	kuru	: now your broken system takes up much more time
2005-09-23T15:47:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	kuru	: do a dist-upgrade
2005-09-23T15:48:00.000Z	kuru	lsuactiafner	doing it.. estimates a day to finish :(
2005-09-23T15:48:00.000Z	kuru	lsuactiafner	surely there is a quicker way ;)
2005-09-23T15:48:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	kuru	: will take me around 2 week to have my dist-upgrade finished.
2005-09-23T15:48:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	kuru	: no.
2005-09-23T15:49:00.000Z	kuru	lsuactiafner	so I have one doing the upgrade and another one I'm trying to tinker with while the other is downloading
2005-09-23T06:29:00.000Z	kuru	lsuactiafner	so i've done the dist-upgrade, but no dice
