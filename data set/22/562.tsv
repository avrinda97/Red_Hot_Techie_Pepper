2012-02-05T05:07:00.000Z	funnyfingers		The file doesn't exist.
2012-02-05T05:08:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	that's not an ubuntu install
2012-02-05T05:08:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	the ubuntu install doesn't get put in that location
2012-02-05T05:08:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	what distro is it ?
2012-02-05T05:08:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	ok - so where did you get mysql from ?
2012-02-05T05:08:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	so they are the people who will support you
2012-02-05T05:09:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	you've not using ubuntu's mysql
2012-02-05T05:09:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	ubuntus does have a socket file
2012-02-05T05:09:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	it's not an ubuntu software product or problem
2012-02-05T05:10:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	the daemon creates it
2012-02-05T05:10:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	again #vmware is the channel for this
2012-02-05T05:11:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	yes it is, it's a vmware product, this isn't an ubuntu issue/application
2012-02-05T05:13:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	also http://support.zimbra.com/supportlogin.php
2012-02-05T05:13:00.000Z	funnyfingers	ikonia	you are missing my whole question.
2012-02-05T05:14:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	that's fine, however that product is a custom vmware product maintained and supported by vmware
2012-02-05T05:14:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	that's why I'm linking you to the #vmware channel and the Zimba support resources,
2012-02-05T05:15:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	the mysql daemon creates/removes the socket file now
2012-02-05T05:15:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	however as this is a custom mysql build, we can't really say how it is supposed to be setup
2012-02-05T05:17:00.000Z	funnyfingers	ikonia	and I said earlier I am going to dig through the debian mysql daeom and see how they create it.
2012-02-05T05:17:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	how will that add any value when it's a custom build
2012-02-05T05:18:00.000Z	ikonia	funnyfingers	you need to be talking to vmware, the debian build will be different
