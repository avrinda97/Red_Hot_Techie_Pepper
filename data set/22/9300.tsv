2004-12-27T10:41:00.000Z	diego	da_bon_bon	you don't download a hoary install disc (yet), if that's what you're looking for
2004-12-27T10:41:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	diego	oh that was what i was looking for. then how do i get hoary?
2004-12-27T10:42:00.000Z	diego	da_bon_bon	you use hoary repositories and dist-upgrade
2004-12-27T10:43:00.000Z	diego	da_bon_bon	yeah, there's no hoary install discs available yet to my knowledge so you need warty first

2004-12-27T10:55:00.000Z	diego	da_bon_bon	i'm 16 too. w00t for 16-year olds
2004-12-27T10:57:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	diego	yes. w00t nice to have someone of my age out here :)
2004-12-27T10:57:00.000Z	diego	da_bon_bon	i guess you'd be interested in learning that "have been born" is considered awkward (if not incorrect) because "have been" implies it has happened many times/over an extended period of time...and i assume you were only born once.
2004-12-27T10:57:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	diego	i am soooo sorry i was playin yahoo pool and was typing in hurry, so the grammatical mistake
2004-12-27T10:58:00.000Z	diego	da_bon_bon	oh no problem, just trying to help you learn the language (I come from Argentina, myself, but now I live in Texas)
2004-12-27T10:59:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	diego	i know the language quite well, tho mistakes do happen! actually i was typing too fat
2004-12-27T10:59:00.000Z	diego	da_bon_bon	and apparently you still are typing too 'fat' :)
2004-12-27T11:00:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	diego	LOL. sorry again!
