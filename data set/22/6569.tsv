2006-09-23T09:57:00.000Z	ArrenLex	sethk	I didn't get any warnings when I installed Ubuntu. Can you give an example?
2006-09-23T09:57:00.000Z	sethk	ArrenLex	not installing ubuntu, installing the nvidia X drivers for linux.
2006-09-23T09:58:00.000Z	sethk	ArrenLex	no
2006-09-23T09:58:00.000Z	sethk	ArrenLex	those are burried
2006-09-23T09:58:00.000Z	sethk	ArrenLex	it asks you whether to look for a precompiled module.  then it tells you it didn't find a precompiled module.
2006-09-23T09:59:00.000Z	sethk	ArrenLex	indeed.  I'm talking about doing it a different way because he didn't succeed in doing it that way.
2006-09-23T09:59:00.000Z	sethk	ArrenLex	I don't know why it failed.  dummkauf, what happens when you follow the howto?
2006-10-08T12:10:00.000Z	ArrenLex	sethk	Windows' *
2006-10-08T12:18:00.000Z	ArrenLex	sethk	why would you need the livecd to repair the root filesystem?
2006-10-08T12:19:00.000Z	sethk	ArrenLex	because you can't repair a file system while it is mounted
2006-10-08T12:20:00.000Z	ArrenLex	sethk	that admin console doesn't mount the filesystem AFAIK; that's why your /etc/fstab says "defaults,errors=remount-ro" for the options on the root fs. So you can repair it.
2006-10-08T12:20:00.000Z	sethk	ArrenLex	it's mounted read only, but it is still mounted
2006-10-08T12:23:00.000Z	ArrenLex	sethk	the reason you can't fsck a mounted filesystem is because the inodes are in use and the counts are wrong and all these things, and it closes files which can't be closed because they are open and corrupts everything. If you mount a filesystem readonly, it's still in virgin state. You can't fix a filesystem if you can't read it; the livecd mounts it readonly anyway.
2006-10-08T12:29:00.000Z	ArrenLex	sethk	the library is part of a debian package. It's set up properly.
2006-10-08T12:30:00.000Z	sethk	ArrenLex	the only way to get that error is if the library is not in the library path (or it isn't there in the first place, or it is damaged)
2006-10-08T12:30:00.000Z	ArrenLex	sethk	He's running an AMD64 system. If he has the wrong arch library, he'll get the same message.
2006-10-08T12:31:00.000Z	sethk	ArrenLex	true
2006-10-08T12:32:00.000Z	sethk	ArrenLex	I think he's knowlegable enough to have avoided that pitfall
2006-10-08T12:32:00.000Z	ArrenLex	sethk	I quote: "harrism: don't see a 64 bit version," That means that something, somewhere, is 32-bit.
2006-10-08T12:34:00.000Z	sethk	ArrenLex	actually I think he's running something that was linked against a different arch, or a different path.  remember that the library path can be compiled into the running binary
2006-10-08T12:34:00.000Z	sethk	ArrenLex	but you are probably correct, rereading what he said.
2006-10-08T12:34:00.000Z	ArrenLex	sethk	exactly, I think he's running a 32-bit mupen on a 64-bit system, which means his 32-bit mupen is looking for a 32-bit libsdl and finding a 64-bit it can't handle, causing that error.
