2009-11-02T00:02:00.000Z	TxHawks		Hi, I've just installed 9.10 on an eeepc 1005ha. After installing the backports alsa driver the microphone works, but it is really extremely weak. Any ideas on how to fix this?
2009-11-02T00:02:00.000Z	om26er	TxHawks	change mic volume?
2009-11-02T00:03:00.000Z	TxHawks	om26er	not that simple :) it's on max

2009-11-02T00:03:00.000Z	om26er	TxHawks	no mic after i first change the volume from mixer
2009-11-02T00:04:00.000Z	TxHawks	om26er	I have mic, just very low. It stays low even if I plug an external mic. It was ok in Jaunty

2009-11-02T00:05:00.000Z	TxHawks	om26er	yep

2009-11-02T00:11:00.000Z	TxHawks	om26er	the low volume issue
2009-11-02T00:12:00.000Z	om26er	TxHawks	not yet
2009-11-02T00:12:00.000Z	TxHawks	om26er	can't find nothing on it on the web either
2009-11-02T00:13:00.000Z	om26er	TxHawks	which app you using for mic
2009-11-02T00:13:00.000Z	om26er	TxHawks	empathy?

2009-11-02T00:15:00.000Z	TxHawks	om26er	well, thanks anyway
2009-11-02T00:17:00.000Z	TxHawks	om26er	another thing that's strange is that there isn't anywhere to pick the input device
2009-11-02T00:17:00.000Z	TxHawks	om26er	not in alsamixer and not in the gnome applet
2009-11-02T21:24:00.000Z	TxHawks	om26er	did you manage to fix the mic low volume problem?
2009-11-02T21:25:00.000Z	om26er	TxHawks	i have not used it with empathy but in pidgin its working fine
