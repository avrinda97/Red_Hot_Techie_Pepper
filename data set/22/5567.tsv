2007-04-13T06:50:00.000Z	mokchin	foxiness	sudo dpkg -L <package-name>
2007-04-13T06:50:00.000Z	mokchin	foxiness	it's pretty straight forward. you get the package from the repo and let the package manager do the magic.
2007-04-13T06:51:00.000Z	mokchin	foxiness	afterwards use dpkg -L <package-name> to figure out where it is installed
