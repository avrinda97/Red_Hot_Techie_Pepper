2008-04-26T19:15:00.000Z	ifireball	pwm	my scroll buffer is limited, what are you trying to do?
2008-04-26T19:23:00.000Z	pwm	ifireball	I'm trying to get a remote login to gdm
2008-04-26T19:24:00.000Z	ifireball	pwm	with XDMCP?
2008-04-26T19:24:00.000Z	pwm	ifireball	yes
2008-04-26T19:24:00.000Z	ifireball	pwm	what seems to be the problem?
2008-04-26T19:25:00.000Z	pwm	ifireball	is there a way to go somewhere with less traffic?
2008-04-26T19:27:00.000Z	ifireball	pwm	are you registered with nickserv?
2008-04-26T19:27:00.000Z	pwm	ifireball	don't think you can read my messages
2008-04-26T19:28:00.000Z	ifireball	pwm	yeah, I need to allow you somehow, can't quite remember how to do that, w8
2008-04-26T19:28:00.000Z	pwm	ifireball	i have enabled remote gdm login using gdmsetup but when i execute X -broadcast/-query etc I get the grey X window screen with only the cursor, no greeter
2008-04-26T19:30:00.000Z	ifireball	pwm	what have you configured for use on remote connections? the greeter of the themed login?
2008-04-26T19:31:00.000Z	pwm	ifireball	greeter style: = plain#
2008-04-26T19:32:00.000Z	ifireball	pwm	sounds like a networking/bandwidth problem, may it be that the host you're connecting to cannot back-resolve the host you're connecting from?
2008-04-26T19:32:00.000Z	ifireball	pwm	if reverse-resolution isn't working properly gdm can take a LOT of time to show the greeter
2008-04-26T19:33:00.000Z	pwm	ifireball	- howto find that out? I was working OK with gentoo before I installed ubuntu
2008-04-26T19:34:00.000Z	ifireball	pwm	I see, try running "host <ip.of.client.here>" on the server and make sure you get the right name back
2008-04-26T19:35:00.000Z	pwm	ifireball	can we go to ubunto-iso only 4 users there
2008-04-26T19:35:00.000Z	ifireball	pwm	also do a sanity check, make sure you see gdm listening on port 177 when you run "sudo netstat -lupn"
2008-04-26T19:37:00.000Z	pwm	ifireball	right host says ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
2008-04-26T19:37:00.000Z	pwm	ifireball	could it be an ipv6 problem?
2008-04-26T19:38:00.000Z	ifireball	pwm	you mean the "host" command gave you that? that means you have a DNS problem (not sure its related though)
2008-04-26T19:42:00.000Z	ifireball	pwm	if you see it listen as :::177 its ok
