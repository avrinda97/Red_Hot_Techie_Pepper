2009-06-24T06:37:00.000Z	licul		any good debugger for linux?
2009-06-24T06:38:00.000Z	ShortWave	licul	did you get that?
2009-06-24T06:38:00.000Z	licul	ShortWave	ok. i'll google it for more info. Thanks
2009-06-24T06:38:00.000Z	ShortWave	licul	ddd = Data Display Debugger.
2009-06-24T06:39:00.000Z	licul	ShortWave	is ddd a gui application?
2009-06-24T06:39:00.000Z	ShortWave	licul	apt-get install ddd is a good start
2009-06-24T06:39:00.000Z	ShortWave	licul	Yes
2009-06-24T06:39:00.000Z	ShortWave	licul	I presume you know how to compile for debugging, yes?
2009-06-24T06:39:00.000Z	licul	ShortWave	oh. there is no internet connection at home. i have to install it manually. =(
2009-06-24T06:40:00.000Z	ShortWave	licul	No need for snarkiness, it was a fair question.
2009-06-24T06:43:00.000Z	licul	ShortWave	how about IDA pro?
2009-06-24T06:43:00.000Z	ShortWave	licul	That's a windows debugger, is it not?
2009-06-24T06:44:00.000Z	ShortWave	licul	And that's more of a DISASSEMBLER, not neccessarily a debugger.
2009-06-24T06:44:00.000Z	licul	ShortWave	ok.
2009-06-24T06:47:00.000Z	licul	ShortWave	i have downloaded ddd_3.3.11-1_i386.deb, how about its dependicies? i'm using ubuntu 7.4
2009-06-24T06:47:00.000Z	ShortWave	licul	Probably needs gdb
2009-06-24T06:47:00.000Z	ShortWave	licul	at the very least...and Motif.
2009-06-24T06:48:00.000Z	licul	ShortWave	alright. i'll check it out once i got home. thanks again. :)
2009-06-24T06:48:00.000Z	ShortWave	licul	I do believe you could look the package up and see what deps it has...
2009-06-24T06:50:00.000Z	licul	ShortWave	there are so many files to download. are there any ways that i can download it in a single package?
2009-06-24T06:50:00.000Z	licul	ShortWave	its a misery
