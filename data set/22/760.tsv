2011-10-20T01:18:00.000Z	[twisti]		so nobody has any idea of how to even get a valid error message out of sshd ?
2011-10-20T01:20:00.000Z	[twisti]		can anyone even read me ?
2011-10-20T01:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[twisti]	I see your text, yes
2011-10-20T01:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[twisti]	I'm connected via ssh now (from work)
2011-10-20T01:22:00.000Z	[twisti]	ActionParsnip	thats, uh, nice for you. not really sure why you told me though :p
2011-10-20T01:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[twisti]	well when i log in I get a message from sshd, don't I..?
2011-10-20T01:25:00.000Z	[twisti]	ActionParsnip	maybe, i dont know. do you ?
2012-09-17T02:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[twisti]	if you boot to the server installation, you can press CTRL+ALT+F1 and get a terminal
2012-09-17T02:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[twisti]	the regular download has the option to run a live desktop and not install
2012-10-12T18:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[twisti]	if you run:    /usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-updates-available     are you told?
2012-10-12T18:56:00.000Z	[twisti]	ActionParsnip	thanks, i just read on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareUpdates that i have to install that ;)
2012-10-12T18:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[twisti]	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1275049
2012-10-12T18:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[twisti]	no, ubuntu uses deb
2012-10-12T18:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[twisti]	no dep hell is when you need to scour the web to satisfy deps
2012-10-12T18:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[twisti]	then find that that too has deps you need to satisfy
2012-10-12T19:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[twisti]	well yeah, that will install the whole gnome desktop for you
2012-10-12T19:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[twisti]	/etc/update-motd.d   just like my pastebin shows
2012-10-12T19:08:00.000Z	[twisti]	ActionParsnip	i dont understand what youre trying to say
2012-10-12T19:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[twisti]	its the location of the script.
2012-10-12T19:09:00.000Z	[twisti]	ActionParsnip	yes, on your pc. do you suggest that i refence the file on your pc via ftp ? or email them to me ?
2012-10-12T19:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[twisti]	I already cat'd the files, so you have the contents....
2012-10-12T19:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[twisti]	isn't it the same as me sending you the file?
