2007-04-25T12:48:00.000Z	dbxwanderer		Thanks for your help, when the buzz dies down a bit and you guys aren't swamped. I'd like to chat with you all again to learn all these details. unless yo can recommend a good website? I know a fair amount on xp stuff but am a complete noob on linux.
2007-04-25T12:49:00.000Z	dbxwanderer		I do have samba on the linux box
2007-04-25T12:49:00.000Z	dbxwanderer		I dont know if sharing is enabled on my XP PC though. When I try and share a folder -- the check box that normally says "Share this folder" is all grey'd out.
2007-04-25T12:50:00.000Z	dbxwanderer		Hmmm
2007-04-25T12:50:00.000Z	dbxwanderer		So essentially I could set up my router to port forward certain applications to a specific local ip
2007-04-25T12:51:00.000Z	dbxwanderer		And I could access it remotely?
2007-04-25T12:51:00.000Z	dbxwanderer		I'll have to have you show me that someday
2007-04-25T12:52:00.000Z	dbxwanderer		ok i'll read up on those websites
2007-04-25T12:52:00.000Z	dbxwanderer		It would be nice to memorize a lot of the commands, what each folder is for, networking capabilities configurations and compatibilities, etc.
2007-04-25T12:53:00.000Z	dbxwanderer		ok whats SSH exactly?
2007-04-25T12:53:00.000Z	Gumby	dbxwanderer	it allows people to hack you
2007-04-25T12:53:00.000Z	Gumby	dbxwanderer	hehe, just kitting.  its a secure server so that a person can log into and administrate their pc from a remote location
2007-04-25T13:01:00.000Z	Gumby	dbxwanderer	yes, www.google.com :)
2007-04-25T13:14:00.000Z	Gumby	dbxwanderer	which makes it quite safe because as soon as an exploit is found it will be reported and then fixed.  unlike MS where it gets fied when they feel its a threat to their finances
2007-04-25T13:17:00.000Z	Gumby	dbxwanderer	when you connect to a mail server with a mail client you have a client (your pc) and a server (probably your ISP).  you connect to them, transfer data, then log off.  ssh is essentially a client/server relationship similar to your mail client/server (in that there is a client connecting to a server and exchanging information).  this is grossly oversimplifying things, but ssh is just a client connecting to a server over a sec
2007-04-25T13:23:00.000Z	Gumby	dbxwanderer	you can create an entry in /etc/fstab for it. I think there is a gui way as well
2007-04-25T13:27:00.000Z	Gumby	dbxwanderer	just run gparted
2007-04-25T13:28:00.000Z	Gumby	dbxwanderer	install gparted via synaptic and then you could either find it in the ubuntu menu or open a console and do sudo gparted
2007-04-25T13:29:00.000Z	Gumby	dbxwanderer	the package installer in ubuntu
2007-04-25T13:30:00.000Z	Gumby	dbxwanderer	open a console, sudo apt-get install gparted
2007-04-25T13:30:00.000Z	Gumby	dbxwanderer	and synaptic IS there. system->administration->synaptic package manager
2007-04-25T13:44:00.000Z	Gumby	dbxwanderer	you can auto mount an ntfs partition.  its just writing to it that isnt 100% stable.  but there is a driver that has write support
