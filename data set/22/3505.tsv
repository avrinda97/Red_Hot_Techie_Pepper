2009-07-06T07:25:00.000Z	mdg		hi Ruby !
2009-07-06T07:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdg	no she is going  to do Samba, once she has the shared folder sorted out and that
2009-08-01T06:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdg	yeah :)
2009-08-01T06:56:00.000Z	mdg	sebsebseb	thanks for helping jonesy_  :)
2009-11-30T05:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdg	yeah 8.10 a rather nice release,  unfortunatly though support will be running out soon
2009-11-30T05:30:00.000Z	mdg	sebsebseb	I
2009-11-30T05:31:00.000Z	mdg	sebsebseb	I've been dragging my feet...
2009-11-30T05:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdg	ok the ethernet on the other computer didn't just work with 8.10, but other then that,  it's been a good release for me, but then I wanted Ext4 so bye bye 8.10
2009-11-30T05:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdg	meaning what exactly?
2009-11-30T05:31:00.000Z	mdg	sebsebseb	so no major problems with 9.10 for you?
2009-11-30T05:32:00.000Z	mdg	sebsebseb	the backing stuff up - I always rearrange stuff
2009-11-30T05:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdg	I had a sound issue,   after running a virtual machine, then losing sound on the host, but other then that no actsaul issues,  just features I didn't like, hence dumping it for another distro
2009-11-30T05:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdg	9.04  is an ok release
2009-11-30T05:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdg	,but if you stay on 8.10 for now,  you can clean install and put 10.04 on when that's out
2009-11-30T05:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdg	that's a good idea, since then you get Ext4 and Grub 2 by default :)  you won't get that when upgrading from 8.10, through 9.04, and 9.10.  plus  the 9.04 to 9.10 upgrade might go wrong on you
2009-11-30T05:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdg	10.04 is the next Long Term Support release
2009-11-30T05:35:00.000Z	mdg	sebsebseb	I will probably wait - time to clear things out I don't want anymore
2009-11-30T05:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdg	hmm going back to the issue that I had with 9.10 and coudn't be bothered to try and fix since  decided to put on another distro instead.   I wasn't that clear,  I had log in sound for 9.10 and such, but once I ran a virtual machine,  I lost the sound on the 9.10 host.
2009-11-30T05:39:00.000Z	mdg	sebsebseb	what distro to you go with?
2009-11-30T05:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdg	Mandriva
2009-11-30T07:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mdg	^^^^^^
