2007-04-09T13:44:00.000Z	velko	telos	you're asking for a flame ware ;-)
2007-04-09T13:44:00.000Z	velko	telos	war*
2007-04-09T13:45:00.000Z	telos	velko	>< I'm just newbie :s
2007-04-09T13:45:00.000Z	velko	telos	ok. then you can go with one partition for /, one for /home and one for swap
2007-04-09T13:45:00.000Z	telos		Ok i just formatted my HDD, and now i want to know what partitions i need
2007-04-09T13:46:00.000Z	telos		i have swap 768 mb
2007-04-09T13:46:00.000Z	telos		i have ext3 10gb
2007-04-09T13:46:00.000Z	velko	telos	separate /home is nice so that your data does not get wiped out if you have to reinstall or change distro
2007-04-09T13:46:00.000Z	telos		and rest 64 gb NTFS
2007-04-09T13:46:00.000Z	velko	telos	swap is a must have (still)
2007-04-09T13:46:00.000Z	telos		i have windows on other hdd
2007-04-09T13:46:00.000Z	velko	telos	and you have to install the main system in /
2007-04-09T13:47:00.000Z	telos		so i should create 3 partitions for ubuntu, 1 swap and 2 ext3?
2007-04-09T13:47:00.000Z	velko	telos	the thread scrolls fast and i missed your comments because you're not including my nick in your answers. type vel[TAB]  and ti will be autocompleted
2007-04-09T13:48:00.000Z	velko	telos	if you use my nick i'll see your messages highlighted
2007-04-09T13:49:00.000Z	telos	velko	i don't know still if i should make 3 partitions or 2 ><
2007-04-09T13:50:00.000Z	velko	telos	look: the bare minimum is one partition: /
2007-04-09T13:50:00.000Z	telos	velko	it works better if its on 3 partitions or 2
2007-04-09T13:50:00.000Z	velko	telos	wait a second i'll explain it and you will decide for yourself
2007-04-09T13:51:00.000Z	telos	velko	you can pm me also if you want :)
