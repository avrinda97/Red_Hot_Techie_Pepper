2006-03-26T06:49:00.000Z	Zanth		I must have a menu.lst somewhere...and grub must be accessing it...but I can't find it anywhere
2006-03-26T06:49:00.000Z	kingspawn	Zanth	find / -name menu.lst -print
2006-03-26T06:49:00.000Z	Zanth	kingspawn	I did that already...no luck
2006-03-26T06:49:00.000Z	kingspawn	Zanth	and your os still boots?
2006-03-26T06:51:00.000Z	Zanth	kingspawn	yes, I can boot into 2.6.12-10-amd64-smp, a myriad of other options and my XP on another SATA drive
2006-03-26T06:51:00.000Z	kingspawn	Zanth	find "device.map" then
2006-03-26T06:52:00.000Z	kingspawn	Zanth	just to be sure, you are finding "menu.lst" (list) and not menu.1st( first), right?
2006-03-26T06:52:00.000Z	kingspawn	Zanth	what about device.map?
2006-03-26T06:53:00.000Z	kingspawn	Zanth	fantastic :)
2006-03-26T06:53:00.000Z	kingspawn	Zanth	okay, find vmlinuz*
2006-03-26T06:55:00.000Z	kingspawn	Zanth	i'd appreciate if you prefix your messages to me with my nick. what else is in /boot?
2006-03-26T06:57:00.000Z	Zanth	kingspawn	I have what looks like a whole lot of kernel files, vmlinuz-x... some config version, abis,
2006-03-26T06:57:00.000Z	kingspawn	Zanth	use pastebin.com to paste your whole "ls"
2006-03-26T06:57:00.000Z	Zanth	kingspawn	an initrd. img etc
2006-03-26T06:58:00.000Z	Zanth	kingspawn	I can't get to a web browswer
2006-03-26T06:58:00.000Z	kingspawn	Zanth	PM me then
2006-03-26T07:00:00.000Z	Zanth	kingspawn	I think pm's are not permissible?
2006-03-26T07:00:00.000Z	kingspawn	Zanth	you have to register with "nickserv" first
2006-03-26T07:01:00.000Z	kingspawn	Zanth	/msg nickserv help register -> or the other way around
2006-03-26T07:01:00.000Z	Zanth	kingspawn	thanks, is there a simple way to do this?
2006-03-26T07:01:00.000Z	Zanth	kingspawn	thanks
2006-03-26T07:01:00.000Z	kingspawn	Zanth	never a simple way :)
