2007-01-22T07:31:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	kiamo	i use the xine backend for totem and i think its a lot better, that has menus etc.
2007-01-22T07:32:00.000Z	kiamo	CookedGryphon	how do i do that?
2007-01-22T07:32:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	kiamo	apt-get install totem-xine
2007-01-22T07:35:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	kiamo	the only thing i can think of is if your graphics drivers don't like it, and so your x server dies, and gets restarted
2007-01-22T07:36:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	kiamo	what graphics drivers are you using?
2007-01-22T07:38:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	kiamo	yet they play without menus in totem-gstreamer?
2007-01-22T07:41:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	kiamo	well you should be able to change by right clicking and skipping to chapter, but that's far from ideal. Thing is if gstreamer can play it, why can't anything else
2007-01-22T07:42:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	kiamo	to put totem back to playing them without menus do apt-get install totem-gstreamer by the way
2007-01-22T07:43:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	kiamo	all i can think of is the output method causing the problem in xine... are you usig xgl or anything by the way?
2007-01-22T07:44:00.000Z	kiamo	CookedGryphon	yea im using fglrx
2007-01-22T07:46:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	kiamo	i wonder if totem-xine would work in a plain x session...
2007-01-22T07:46:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	kiamo	can you test that?
2007-01-22T07:46:00.000Z	kiamo	CookedGryphon	how ?
2007-01-22T07:47:00.000Z	kiamo	CookedGryphon	i tried to play dvds from the cmd line with mplayer but that didnt work either, altho i did get sound
2007-01-22T07:49:00.000Z	kiamo	CookedGryphon	with vlc it just closes the program after a segmentation error, and mplayer i cant remember what it said...
2007-01-22T07:56:00.000Z	kiamo	CookedGryphon	now mplayer is saying that it cant be installed on my computer type (amd64)
2007-01-22T08:08:00.000Z	kiamo	CookedGryphon	sorry this is taking so long
2007-01-22T08:09:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	kiamo	i'm not sure, haven't ever used the ati drivers
2007-01-22T08:10:00.000Z	kiamo	CookedGryphon	(mplayer is compiling btw)
2007-01-22T08:19:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	kiamo	mv
2007-01-22T08:21:00.000Z	kiamo	CookedGryphon	im done haha, opening up gmplayer gives me errors instantly...
2007-01-22T08:21:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	kiamo	ah well, at least you've got somethign to work with,
