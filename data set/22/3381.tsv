2009-05-25T02:26:00.000Z	Daps		I had a hard disk running Windows, i just installed on my linux box, can can't seem to format it with cfdisk... any idea why? can't delete the windows systems files either...
2009-05-25T02:27:00.000Z	Gnea	Daps	are you root?
2009-05-25T02:27:00.000Z	Daps	Gnea	yea.. I did the whole sudo thing
2009-05-25T02:27:00.000Z	Gnea	Daps	try gparted instead of cfdisk
2009-05-25T02:27:00.000Z	Daps	Gnea	tried that too
2009-05-25T02:28:00.000Z	Gnea	Daps	what kind of disk is it? internal or external?
2009-05-25T02:28:00.000Z	Daps	Gnea	gparted won't even lot me format it at all, its internal
2009-05-25T02:28:00.000Z	Gnea	Daps	and you're booted to livecd?
2009-05-25T02:29:00.000Z	Daps	Gnea	i don't know what that is
2009-05-25T02:29:00.000Z	Gnea	Daps	it's the Ubuntu cdrom that lets you choose to enter install mode or boot to a desktop off of the cd... hence, 'livecd' :)
2009-05-25T02:30:00.000Z	Daps	Gnea	oh no i booted off of a hard disk that exists already, just took another hard drive off a windows machine and wanted to use it for storage etc...
2009-05-25T02:31:00.000Z	Gnea	Daps	weird... try it with the livecd and see what happens
2009-05-25T02:31:00.000Z	Gnea	Daps	also make sure it's not mounted
2009-05-25T02:31:00.000Z	Daps	Gnea	you mean do the whole install thing
2009-05-25T02:31:00.000Z	Gnea	Daps	uh, no.
2009-05-25T02:31:00.000Z	Daps	Gnea	i'll give it a shot unmounted... thanks
2009-05-25T02:31:00.000Z	Gnea	Daps	yeah, it's not going to allow you to do anything if it's mounted - the whole disk has to be unmounted
2009-05-25T02:31:00.000Z	Daps	Gnea	i think that should work
2009-05-25T02:31:00.000Z	Gnea	Daps	:)
2009-05-25T02:32:00.000Z	Daps	Gnea	Thanks :D
2009-05-25T02:37:00.000Z	Daps	Gnea	thanks it worked
