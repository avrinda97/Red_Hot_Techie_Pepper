2012-03-11T19:39:00.000Z	auronandace	sacarlson	after he has installed windows how is he going to boot ubuntu to run grub-update?
2012-03-11T19:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	auronandace	arunkumar413: you will need a bootable usb pen drive or cd disk or pxe boot or ??
2012-03-11T19:42:00.000Z	auronandace	sacarlson	yes i agree but he said he doesn't have a livecd and its not really practical to get one
2012-03-11T19:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	auronandace	and usb flash drive or pxe are those posible?
2012-03-11T19:43:00.000Z	auronandace	sacarlson	i wouldn't know about pxe, but he just said no to cd or usb
2012-03-11T19:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	auronandace	at that point I would go to the store and get a new $3 usb flash disk then, or maybe a spare hard disk?
2012-03-11T19:45:00.000Z	auronandace	sacarlson	i don't know his circumstances sorry, usbs are cheap here in the uk too
2012-03-11T19:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	auronandace	even if pxe boot off lan is posible it can get more complicated on the first run
2012-03-11T20:00:00.000Z	auronandace	sacarlson	isn't rmmod used to remove a module from the kernel? and modprobe to load/unload it?
2012-03-11T20:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	auronandace	that sound about write, but some devices need more time to settle
2012-03-11T20:05:00.000Z	auronandace	sacarlson	i think the manpages say to use modprobe -r to unload it
2012-03-11T20:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	auronandace	yes I also see that recomended in the man rmmod page,  but it's worked for me in the past, don't recall myself ever using the modprobe -r
2012-03-11T20:08:00.000Z	auronandace	sacarlson	can't say i have much experience with modprobe myself (yay, i'm learning)
2012-03-11T20:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	auronandace	ya modprobe -r looks better since it also pulls other modules that depend on the one you remove
2012-03-11T20:08:00.000Z	auronandace	sacarlson	ah, cool
2012-04-16T14:53:00.000Z	auronandace	sacarlson	doesn't networkmanager overwrite /etc/network/interfaces ?
2012-04-16T14:54:00.000Z	sacarlson	auronandace	not as far as I know,  maybe at install?  but I was told the method to set static was to modify /etc/network/interfaces
2012-04-16T14:55:00.000Z	auronandace	sacarlson	ah, i may be remembering wrongly then, thanks for the info
2012-06-09T17:19:00.000Z	auronandace	sacarlson	sda6 is a linux partitition
2012-06-09T17:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	auronandace	is that a question if so yes
2012-06-09T17:20:00.000Z	auronandace	sacarlson	so you meant fsxk not chkdsk?
2012-06-09T17:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	auronandace	your right fsck  mino123  sudo fsck /dev/sda6
