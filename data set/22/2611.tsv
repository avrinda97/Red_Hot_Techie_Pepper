2009-11-17T16:20:00.000Z	indus	zcat[1]	i didnt disconnect though
2009-11-17T16:21:00.000Z	indus	zcat[1]	also good to use -v with fsck or maybe even vv
2009-11-17T16:22:00.000Z	zcat[1]	indus	 the output of fsck is quite confusing enough thanks
2009-11-26T14:02:00.000Z	zcat[1]	indus	 my kids can figure out how to add things to the panel... it can't be that difficult to figure out ;)
2009-11-26T14:02:00.000Z	indus	zcat[1]	i shouldnt be searching for an applet as simple as windows list
2009-11-26T14:03:00.000Z	indus	zcat[1]	you assume all users will search heaven and earth to figure out where windows disappeared, how can ubuntu be so stupid
2009-11-26T14:03:00.000Z	indus	zcat[1]	3 years and it still is the same
2009-11-26T14:03:00.000Z	zcat[1]	indus	 it's only a problem is you DELETE one of the panels.. in the default install everything is there
2009-11-26T14:04:00.000Z	indus	zcat[1]	hmm yeah ok got it now
2009-11-26T14:04:00.000Z	indus	zcat[1]	Madpilot aah missed that completely, i always delete the panel to create new one. thats why
2009-11-26T14:04:00.000Z	zcat[1]	indus	 the thing to do is move everything to one panel before you delete the other
2010-06-23T15:09:00.000Z	indus	zcat[1]	is that a gui tool ?
2010-06-23T15:10:00.000Z	zcat[1]	indus	 you haven't looked very hard. Open synaptic, search for 'backup'
2010-06-23T15:10:00.000Z	indus	zcat[1]	ok
2010-06-23T15:17:00.000Z	indus	zcat[1]	no issues, for every ActionParsnip there is one indus
2010-06-23T15:19:00.000Z	zcat[1]	indus	 the command line is very powerful, but also you really can do just about anything from the GUI as well
2010-06-23T15:25:00.000Z	indus	zcat[1]	grsync seems quite good
2010-06-23T15:26:00.000Z	zcat[1]	indus	 also be aware that many of the "GUI tools" are just a front end and invoke the same command line tools to actually do the work ;)
2010-06-23T15:26:00.000Z	indus	zcat[1]	yes i did create a small gui app once :) using tk
2010-07-12T14:53:00.000Z	indus	zcat[1]	yesssssssss so true, its the worst video editor i have ever seen, and it doenst even work properly
2010-07-12T14:54:00.000Z	zcat[1]	indus	 the scarey thing, gimp was damn near even a better video editor...
