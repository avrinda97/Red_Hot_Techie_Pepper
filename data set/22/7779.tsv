2005-12-29T16:05:00.000Z	burning_bronx		true
2005-12-29T16:06:00.000Z	burning_bronx		Ubuntu goes with metacity
2005-12-29T16:07:00.000Z	burning_bronx		allow me to explain
2005-12-29T16:07:00.000Z	burning_bronx		Gnome and KDE are desktop environments
2005-12-29T16:07:00.000Z	burning_bronx		the window manager is something different
2005-12-29T16:07:00.000Z	burning_bronx		Gnome uses Metacity
2005-12-29T16:08:00.000Z	burning_bronx		and you can use openbox for example
2005-12-29T16:08:00.000Z	burning_bronx		then of course this includes a fair share of command line
2005-12-29T16:08:00.000Z	burning_bronx		heh
2005-12-29T16:08:00.000Z	HeartBT	burning_bronx	there is an easy way, but...
2005-12-29T16:14:00.000Z	HeartBT	burning_bronx	prob. soaps on there.
2005-12-29T16:19:00.000Z	HeartBT	burning_bronx	you paly with dapper yet?
2005-12-29T16:19:00.000Z	burning_bronx	HeartBT	been using dapper since it started
2005-12-29T16:19:00.000Z	HeartBT	burning_bronx	and....?  fairly stable with cd2?
2005-12-29T16:20:00.000Z	HeartBT	burning_bronx	kewl  Now, you were there for the hoary>breezy upgrade, was it a reinstall like situation or did it upgrade to stable ok.
2005-12-29T16:21:00.000Z	burning_bronx	HeartBT	I haven't done a fresh install since hoary
2005-12-29T16:21:00.000Z	HeartBT	burning_bronx	So maybe I should have not wasted the time dl'ing Kububu breezy and just have done dapper?
2005-12-29T16:22:00.000Z	burning_bronx	HeartBT	using dapper may break your system fatally
2005-12-29T16:29:00.000Z	burning_bronx	HeartBT	there is a serious media blackout about her
2005-12-29T16:30:00.000Z	burning_bronx	HeartBT	is correct
2005-12-31T11:42:00.000Z	HeartBT	burning_bronx	is there a file I can add to my home dir to enable composite estensions to just my sessions?
