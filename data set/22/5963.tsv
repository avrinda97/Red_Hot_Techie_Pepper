2007-01-15T11:12:00.000Z	tfny1		How to find the /dev/ file for the partition ? fdisk shows me there is a hdb (and a hdb1) but mount tells me that this does not exist
2007-01-15T11:12:00.000Z	tfny1		it?
2007-01-15T11:13:00.000Z	Pommie	tfny1	if fdisk reports that you have a partition at hdb1, perhaps try mounting /dev/hdb1.
2007-01-15T11:16:00.000Z	Pommie	tfny1	:  Try this command as superuser... cd /dev && MAKEDEV generic
2007-01-15T11:18:00.000Z	tfny1	Pommie	is working
2007-01-15T11:18:00.000Z	Pommie	tfny1	after that finishes, try the mount again.
2007-01-15T11:21:00.000Z	Pommie	tfny1	what's the output from   ls -l /dev/hdb1 ?
2007-01-15T11:22:00.000Z	tfny1	Pommie	no such file or dir
2007-01-15T11:24:00.000Z	Pommie	tfny1	hang on, lemme research something
2007-01-15T11:26:00.000Z	Pommie	tfny1	: These are just regular IDE drives, right?
2007-01-15T11:26:00.000Z	tfny1	Pommie	yes
2007-01-15T11:28:00.000Z	Pommie	tfny1	: in fdisk /dev/hdb, try verifying your partition table with the 'v' command.
2007-01-15T11:29:00.000Z	tfny1	Pommie	"Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary"
2007-01-15T11:30:00.000Z	Pommie	tfny1	I suspect that your drive partition is mangled
2007-01-15T11:31:00.000Z	Pommie	tfny1	what do you get in fdisk's 'p' output?
2007-01-15T11:36:00.000Z	Pommie	tfny1	: line 2 of the fdisk 'p' output should show how many cylinders. If the #cyls for your hdb1 partition is beyond that, your partition table may be mangled.
2007-01-15T11:38:00.000Z	tfny1	Pommie	19457 cylinders
2007-01-15T11:39:00.000Z	Pommie	tfny1	: The number before that, the End. Not the #blocks.
2007-01-15T11:43:00.000Z	Pommie	tfny1	: re your massive "End" count. I really think your partition is mangled, and that's why the kernel isn't recognizing the drive partition correctly.
2007-01-15T11:43:00.000Z	tfny1	Pommie	ok
2007-01-15T11:44:00.000Z	Pommie	tfny1	If the data is important, back it up, then destroy the partitions and recreate
2007-01-15T11:44:00.000Z	tfny1	Pommie	ok, I will
