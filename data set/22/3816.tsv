2008-05-31T20:24:00.000Z	anirudh0	philsf	do you think people would find out that they are talking to a bot?
2008-05-31T20:25:00.000Z	philsf	anirudh0	to a bot that has one line? :)
2008-05-31T20:25:00.000Z	anirudh0	philsf	hiw do you know that i am not a bot ;)
2008-05-31T20:26:00.000Z	philsf	anirudh0	since you are infinitely more sofisticated than danone???, I'll have to ask Mr. Harisson Ford
2008-05-31T20:27:00.000Z	anirudh0	philsf	how would an actor know about the turing test?
2008-05-31T20:28:00.000Z	philsf	anirudh0	oh, my... these people today have no respect for the classics...

2008-05-31T20:44:00.000Z	philsf	anirudh0	gcc command is provided by the gcc package
2008-05-31T20:45:00.000Z	philsf	anirudh0	oh, I missed the point
2008-06-12T22:58:00.000Z	anirudh0	philsf	think or know?
2008-06-12T22:58:00.000Z	philsf	anirudh0	know
2008-06-12T22:59:00.000Z	anirudh0	philsf	i think version history is shown on the wiki..find out who wrote it, then mail and clarify
2008-06-12T22:59:00.000Z	anirudh0	philsf	imho
2008-06-12T23:00:00.000Z	philsf	anirudh0	Khisanth: it makes a big confusion for newcomers that try to setup palm devices - the instructions are terribly outdated, and the method described there is not recommended anymore, AFAIK
2008-06-12T23:00:00.000Z	philsf	anirudh0	good point, I'll look into it
2008-06-12T23:00:00.000Z	anirudh0	philsf	you could always start a new wiki page
2008-06-12T23:01:00.000Z	philsf	anirudh0	that's why I thought of a bug report, so there could be some discussion between others that know how to do it right, and craft a consensus text
