2010-01-07T01:03:00.000Z	Rodensky		Hello ppl - ubuntu 9.04 - many times the sound suddenly stops working, what should I do?
2010-01-07T01:05:00.000Z	Rodensky		I restart my pc everytime in order to get the sound back on, untill the next time it goes off (laptop without external speakers, nothing muted)
2010-01-07T01:07:00.000Z	sfears	Rodensky	you've tried "alsamixer" at a command prompt to make sure nothing is muted, or you use your volume control panel?
2010-01-07T01:08:00.000Z	Rodensky	sfears	- i use the ctrl center -> sound
2010-01-07T01:10:00.000Z	Rodensky	sfears	- done - how do i read it? i mean, i see 4 colums painted fully, 2 with 00 under them, 1 without, another 1 with 00, and for empty ones (on with MM under it, one with 00 and 2 more with MM)
2010-01-07T01:11:00.000Z	Rodensky	sfears	- and above it says Item: Master [dB gain=0.00]
2010-01-07T01:12:00.000Z	sfears	Rodensky	those are your volume levels.. if they're all painted they're all turned up.. use your arrow keys to move left and right and turn volumes up and down
2010-01-07T01:15:00.000Z	Rodensky	sfears	- the colums change, yet i can't hear anything
2010-01-07T01:16:00.000Z	sfears	Rodensky	i would say you have some programming taking control of the sound card and muting your speakers.. or you have loose wires
2010-01-07T01:16:00.000Z	Rodensky	sfears	- it has something to do with pulseaudio or something like that?
2010-01-07T01:21:00.000Z	Rodensky	sfears	- i can't uninstall pulseaudio with synaptic, it says that i have to uninstall ubuntu-desktop with it
2010-01-07T01:25:00.000Z	Rodensky	sfears	- remove along with ubuntu-desktop? "ubuntu-desktop" sound too important... :]
2010-01-07T01:26:00.000Z	sfears	Rodensky	guntbert says ubuntu-desktop is a meta-package... extras & stuff.. it shouldn't be a problem.. but i'm not 100% on that
2010-01-07T01:28:00.000Z	Rodensky	sfears	- i think Skype causes these problems because right now i re-opened it and i heared the loading sound when it connects, and that's the only thing i can hear right now - the Skype. is it possible that Skype is messing with my sound?
2010-01-07T01:28:00.000Z	Rodensky	sfears	- and now i can hear all automated sounds that the skype makes but not the people with whom i'm trying to talk
2010-01-07T01:31:00.000Z	Rodensky	sfears	- i have to use skype, turning it off or uninstalling it is not an option for me. how do i make skype use alsa?
2010-01-07T01:33:00.000Z	sfears	Rodensky	there's a configrue skype control panel in there somehwere.. i don't use skype so i don't know
2010-01-07T02:12:00.000Z	Rodensky	sfears	 - every is up....
2010-01-07T02:12:00.000Z	sfears	Rodensky	uninstall skype.. see if it fixes your problem.. you can reinstall after you've diagnosed
2010-01-07T02:17:00.000Z	Rodensky	sfears	- i uninstalled skype and still - no sound
2010-01-07T02:18:00.000Z	Rodensky	sfears	- ok i'll restart
2010-01-07T02:21:00.000Z	Rodensky	sfears	- i restarted - no luck
