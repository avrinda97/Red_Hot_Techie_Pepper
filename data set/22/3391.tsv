2010-02-25T23:25:00.000Z	Industrial		Is there any way I can generate the xorg.conf file from the current settings? I need to make sure that it uses intel drivers and there being no xorg.conf I do not know where to look for that.
2010-02-25T23:25:00.000Z	DasEi1	Industrial	yes, open teminal
2010-02-25T23:26:00.000Z	DasEi1	Industrial	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2010-02-25T23:26:00.000Z	Industrial	DasEi1	what does that do exactly? :)
2010-02-25T23:27:00.000Z	DasEi1	Industrial	it's an automatism , that reads hardwareinfo and (re-)creates xorg.conf with basic settings
2010-02-25T23:27:00.000Z	Industrial	DasEi1	okay nice
2010-02-25T23:29:00.000Z	Industrial	DasEi1	this gets me nothing actually. it doesnt generate a xorg.conf at all and I googled it to see what it looks like but I dont get a config menu, just my shell back.
2010-02-25T23:31:00.000Z	DasEi1	Industrial	gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf   (wath up, case-sensitiv)
2010-02-25T23:31:00.000Z	Industrial	DasEi1	the file doesnt exist, should I touch it?
2010-02-25T23:33:00.000Z	DasEi1	Industrial	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg    << should be there after, sure no typos ?
2010-02-25T23:33:00.000Z	Industrial	DasEi1	yes, it just yields me the shell
2010-02-25T23:34:00.000Z	DasEi1	Industrial	if you run it a second time, shall also tell overwriting/backing up old one
2010-02-25T23:35:00.000Z	Industrial	DasEi1	it doesnt seem to be doing anything, the file stays empty
2010-02-25T23:35:00.000Z	DasEi1	Industrial	sudo apt-get install pastebinit
2010-02-25T23:36:00.000Z	DasEi1	Industrial	(you can copy and paste from messenger to trml to avoid typos)
2010-02-25T23:36:00.000Z	DasEi1	Industrial	pastebinit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2010-02-25T23:37:00.000Z	DasEi1	Industrial	give url from last cmd here
2010-02-25T23:37:00.000Z	Industrial	DasEi1	I know how to open a file. its empty. the reconfigure isnt doing anything.
2010-02-25T23:37:00.000Z	DasEi1	Industrial	which version of ubuntu are you running ? no x installed (unlikely) ?
2010-02-25T23:38:00.000Z	DasEi1	Industrial	pastebinit /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2010-02-25T23:41:00.000Z	Industrial	DasEi1	https://gist.github.com/55a3f6a4cbf8e8b03d6a
2010-02-25T23:43:00.000Z	Industrial	DasEi1	you can see that its trying to use 4 display drivers or something :S
