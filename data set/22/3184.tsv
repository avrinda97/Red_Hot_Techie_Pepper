2009-08-30T14:09:00.000Z	_raven_		is possible to speed up a video using mencoder or ffmpeg?
2009-08-30T14:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_raven_	 you mean play at double speed for example?
2009-08-30T14:11:00.000Z	_raven_	Dr_Willis	yes i need to convert it to mpeg and to speed it up to double speed at the same process (if possible)
2009-08-30T14:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_raven_	 check the ffmpeg and mencoder docs.faq's i imgine both can do it. i just dont know the proper arguments..
2009-08-30T14:12:00.000Z	_raven_	Dr_Willis	i did... but google e.g. only gives me hits for speed up the encoding process....
2009-08-30T14:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_raven_	 i think you may want to change the FPS. but  not sure if thats right or not. Perhaps a mencoder/ffmpeg channel, or video editing channel may have a better 'term' to use
2009-08-30T14:14:00.000Z	_raven_	Dr_Willis	i mean the video should have double speed/half length. possibly reframing is the right way but i did not find anything yet
2009-08-30T14:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_raven_	 tip on doing it in vlc --> http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=60075&start=0

2009-08-30T14:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_raven_	 http://www.linuxjournal.com/video/linux-howto-video-editing-magic-ffmpeg        seems like it covers it.. its a video tutorial however. :)
2009-08-30T14:19:00.000Z	_raven_	Dr_Willis	i'll try... in addition to that there should be a way through a mjpeg-pipe... i'll see

2009-12-05T18:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_raven_	 perhaps use compiz features.. or as i said.. make a wide wallpaper that has the 2 you want to use side by side
2009-12-05T18:45:00.000Z	_raven_	Dr_Willis	ok tnx
2010-11-14T15:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_raven_	 there may be some PPA's or you could always use source.
2010-11-14T15:11:00.000Z	_raven_	Dr_Willis	i tried everything with the tarball - make gives me errors all the time
2010-11-14T15:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_raven_	 sudo apt-get build-deps unison   that will install all the needed deps.  then isntall build-essential package.. and it should compile.
2010-11-14T15:16:00.000Z	_raven_	Dr_Willis	invalid operation with build-deps
2010-11-14T15:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_raven_	 it may be build-dep
2010-11-14T15:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_raven_	 tab completion works for apt-get options. :)
