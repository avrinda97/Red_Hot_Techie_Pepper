2011-01-06T15:33:00.000Z	tehbaut		ok, my maverick livecd really isn't booting... I just get an eternal spinning disk after clicking on Try Ubuntu
2011-01-06T15:34:00.000Z	tehbaut		any ideas what's going on?
2011-01-06T15:34:00.000Z	will___	tehbaut	tried running the CD integrity test?
2011-01-06T15:34:00.000Z	tehbaut	will___	nope, is that something I can do from the disk itself?
2011-01-06T15:35:00.000Z	tehbaut		it's odd because it's been booting just fine until now
2011-01-06T15:35:00.000Z	will___	tehbaut	should do, when it's booting up you should see it right there
2011-01-06T15:35:00.000Z	tehbaut		what could possibly have caused it to stop working now?
2011-01-06T15:35:00.000Z	will___	tehbaut	http://static.howtoforge.com/images/the_perfect_desktop_ubuntu7.04/1.jpg <=== something like that. it COULD look different on the 10.10 live CDs
2011-01-06T15:36:00.000Z	tehbaut	will___	ah, yeah that menu is hidden now on 10.10
2011-01-06T15:36:00.000Z	will___	tehbaut	okay, well if you can unhide it somehow then you should be able to find the test there
2011-01-06T15:37:00.000Z	will___	tehbaut	other than that, i can only advise you to try things like booting it in safe graphics mode, for example
2011-01-06T15:38:00.000Z	will___	tehbaut	so it's either an incompatibility with your hardware and ubuntu (in which case you need to fiddle with different boot options) or the CD is just bad, which will require either reburning one on a slower speed setting, or using better CDs... etc.
2011-01-06T15:39:00.000Z	tehbaut	will___	but that's just it... it's been booting just fine up until now... including 20 minutes ago... and I never removed it from the tray, so it's not like it acquired a scratch since then
2011-01-06T15:40:00.000Z	tehbaut		installer seems to work though, just not the trial
2011-01-06T15:40:00.000Z	will___	tehbaut	you could try using the CD in a different computer or a different CD in the same computer
2011-01-06T15:40:00.000Z	will___	tehbaut	that'll help you diagnose the problem
2011-01-06T15:41:00.000Z	tehbaut		heh, now the trial is working... man, this makes no sense :P
2011-01-06T15:41:00.000Z	will___	tehbaut	if it helps, i've always found liveCDs to be incredibly flakey
2011-01-06T15:41:00.000Z	will___	tehbaut	i usually use USB sticks instead
2011-01-06T15:42:00.000Z	tehbaut	will___	I would, but I can't get any USB sticks to boot on this machine for the life of me
2011-01-06T15:42:00.000Z	tehbaut		been able to do it before, but not lately
2011-01-06T15:43:00.000Z	will___	tehbaut	gotta love terrible, inconsistent BIOS menus for configuring boot orders
