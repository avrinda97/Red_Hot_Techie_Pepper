2010-12-16T03:30:00.000Z	KM0201	oxyrosis	are you sure it's not muted?
2010-12-16T03:31:00.000Z	KM0201	oxyrosis	well, how does lspci identify your sound device.. that would be a place to start
2010-12-16T03:32:00.000Z	oxyrosis	KM0201	how do i do that?
2010-12-16T03:32:00.000Z	KM0201	oxyrosis	open a terminal, and type "lspci" no quotes, and hit enter(thats a lowercase L)... look through the output, and find your sound device, don't paste your whole lspci here.
2010-12-16T03:33:00.000Z	KM0201	oxyrosis	yeah.. hang on.. i've red about a problemw / that device.
2010-12-16T03:35:00.000Z	KM0201	oxyrosis	open a terminal and type     alsamixer   hit enter... and see if any of those are muted

2010-12-16T03:37:00.000Z	KM0201	oxyrosis	i've solved the problem w/ that device before, but it was a long time ago, and i'm trying to remember what the issue was
2010-12-16T03:38:00.000Z	KM0201	oxyrosis	just curious, what kind of laptop do you have?
2010-12-16T03:39:00.000Z	KM0201	oxyrosis	what kind of laptop is it?
2010-12-16T03:40:00.000Z	oxyrosis	KM0201	this is a desktop. i just installed a new motherboard/cpu/ram
2010-12-16T03:41:00.000Z	KM0201	oxyrosis	what version of ubuntu are you using again?
2010-12-16T03:43:00.000Z	KM0201	oxyrosis	type this w/o quotes... "/join #km0201"  i think i found the answer, but it's fairly detailed....

2010-12-16T06:48:00.000Z	KM0201	oxyrosis	lol, sound cards are cheap.
