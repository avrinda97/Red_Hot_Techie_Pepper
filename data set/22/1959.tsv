2009-11-08T02:54:00.000Z	pochi	JakobLaursen	ok, maybe this will work for you then: edit the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-ath_pci.conf and comment out the like that says "blacklist ath5k" (put a # in front of that line)
2009-11-08T02:55:00.000Z	pochi	JakobLaursen	then reboot. hopefully that will resolve it. did for me :)
