2009-12-22T23:47:00.000Z	Some_Person		GDebi says a .deb I made conflicts with a package I have installed, but said package is not installed!
2009-12-22T23:48:00.000Z	Some_Person		GDebi says that a .deb I made conflicts with a package I have installed, but said package is not installed
2009-12-22T23:49:00.000Z	Some_Person		My .deb is supposed to conflict with that package, but for some reason GDebi thinks I have it installed
2009-12-22T23:50:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Some_Person	what are the packages in question?
2009-12-22T23:50:00.000Z	Some_Person	ChogyDan	supertux-data
2009-12-22T23:51:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Some_Person	that is what you are installing?  what is the package that is conflicting?
2009-12-22T23:52:00.000Z	Some_Person	ChogyDan	I made a .deb for the latest SVN version of supertux (named supertux-svn), and I purposely made it conflict with supertux and supertux-data. But GDebi says I have supertux-data installed, when I don't/
2009-12-22T23:53:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Some_Person	hmmm.   what does dpkg say when you use that?
2009-12-22T23:56:00.000Z	Some_Person	ChogyDan	nevermind, I found the problem
2009-12-22T23:56:00.000Z	Some_Person	ChogyDan	I accidentally made it depend on and conflict with supertux-data
2009-12-22T23:57:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Some_Person	I was guessing that it was something like that  :)
2010-11-18T08:52:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Some_Person	are you waiting for pulseaudio to load?  redundent question, but is that what you are doing?
2010-11-18T08:54:00.000Z	Some_Person	ChogyDan	I need to delete the .pulse folder, but not so early that it gets recreated when pulseaudio loads
2010-11-18T08:54:00.000Z	Some_Person	ChogyDan	It's a temporary fix for this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/644644
2010-11-18T08:54:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Some_Person	have you tried an upstart script?
2010-11-18T08:55:00.000Z	Some_Person	ChogyDan	No, I haven't. When would that load?
2010-11-18T08:55:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Some_Person	well, upstart controls everything
2010-11-18T08:59:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Some_Person	on, maybe you could make an upstart script with something like start on started pulseaudio /n exec /bin/sleep 30 /n exec rm the_file
2010-11-18T08:59:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Some_Person	s/on/ok/
2010-11-18T09:01:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Some_Person	if you need syntax help to test that idea, let me know
2010-11-18T09:16:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Some_Person	oh, nother idea, just blank the file and that chattr -i file.  Anyway, gl
2010-11-18T09:27:00.000Z	Some_Person	ChogyDan	I got it to work with a shell script
