2004-12-27T08:19:00.000Z	Cloudchaser		i wish they sold the clamshell ones here
2004-12-27T08:20:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	no wifi or bluetooth builtin :(
2004-12-27T08:21:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	i would be satisfied with an sl-6000 if they weren't 3x the price of the competition
2004-12-27T08:22:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	any idea why zaurus's are soo expensive?
2004-12-27T08:22:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	about $600
2004-12-27T08:23:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	i hear there is one being sold in america
2004-12-27T08:23:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	what you think of the new clamshell
2004-12-27T08:24:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	still upset about no wifi
2004-12-27T08:25:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	hmm, i neeed it
2004-12-27T08:27:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	yeah.... i still have a while before i give up my sidekick or they offer sync, so I am not seriously looking yet
2004-12-27T08:28:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	i love it. the restrictions make it an advantage, imho
2004-12-27T08:31:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	they make an ssh app, and are about to release the vnc one
2004-12-27T08:32:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	i don't mind paying for most apps if i plan to use them, but the ssh app is $10 (most are 4.99 or 2.99)
2004-12-27T08:32:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	yea
2004-12-27T08:33:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	what phone
2004-12-27T08:34:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	thats my problem with any company EXCEPT t-mobile... i pay so little for my phones and service
2004-12-27T08:34:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	i live in boston, every service has decent coverage
2004-12-27T08:36:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	i live about 70% in boston, 30% in NYC.... both of which do fine wiht most companies
2004-12-27T08:36:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	i drive.... i lose service for about 10 minutes on the border of mass and ct
2004-12-27T08:38:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	dont forget, i drive on major highways the whole time though... so any company that DOESN"T have service there is in trouble
2004-12-27T08:41:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Cloudchaser	thats maybe an answer for a developer
