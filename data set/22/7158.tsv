2006-10-03T11:05:00.000Z	j0lliyo		when i do modprobe ndiswrapper, i first get a segmentation fault, then when i try again it doesn't work at alle... just no response from the terminal until i press ctrl c
2006-10-03T11:05:00.000Z	j0lliyo		any idea what the problem might be?
2006-10-03T11:06:00.000Z	achandra	j0lliyo	this could easily be that the driver is incompatible...is it a bcm4318??
2006-10-03T11:06:00.000Z	j0lliyo	achandra	i've used the same driver before
2006-10-03T11:06:00.000Z	achandra	j0lliyo	other than that it could be an irq conflict as well
2006-10-03T11:06:00.000Z	j0lliyo		i just did a reinstall
2006-10-03T11:06:00.000Z	j0lliyo		and now it doesn't work
2006-10-03T11:06:00.000Z	achandra	j0lliyo	have you added any new device or memory??
2006-10-03T11:07:00.000Z	j0lliyo		don't think so
2006-10-03T11:07:00.000Z	j0lliyo		ah a sound card
2006-10-03T11:07:00.000Z	achandra		hmmm..
2006-10-03T11:07:00.000Z	j0lliyo		lsusb stops working aswell after i get the fault
2006-10-03T11:07:00.000Z	achandra		jolliyo: I had a similar problem when adding memory to my system...it just point blank freaked out when enabling ndiswrapper....due to irq conflict...another person had the same issue.
2006-10-03T11:08:00.000Z	achandra	j0lliyo	see comment above...that is what I can think of for now...
2006-10-03T11:08:00.000Z	achandra		jolliy0: does dmesg complain about anything or /var/log/messages?
2006-10-03T11:09:00.000Z	j0lliyo		ok thanks
2006-10-03T11:09:00.000Z	j0lliyo		i'll try it out some more when i get home from work
2006-10-03T11:10:00.000Z	j0lliyo		and no dmesg doesn't complain about anythinng
2006-10-03T11:11:00.000Z	achandra	j0lliyo	when you said it worked before...that was in linux right...or are you referring to before as in windows or something??
2006-10-03T11:11:00.000Z	j0lliyo		it's the exact same installation as i have now
2006-10-03T11:11:00.000Z	j0lliyo		installed ubuntu from the same cd
2006-10-03T11:12:00.000Z	achandra	j0lliyo	I have a suggestion...maybe starting deactivating or unplugging other devices and try it again...maybe you can isolate a conflict??
