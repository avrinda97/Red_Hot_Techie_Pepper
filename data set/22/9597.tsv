2005-09-17T11:49:00.000Z	bob2	eric123	yes, "xinerama" is the keyword
2005-09-17T11:49:00.000Z	bob2	eric123	you already have a driver that supports it
2005-09-17T11:51:00.000Z	bob2	eric123	you really found no documentation on google at all for "ubuntu xinerama howto"?
2005-09-17T11:52:00.000Z	bob2	eric123	now you know :)
2005-09-17T11:53:00.000Z	bob2	eric123	^

2005-09-17T11:58:00.000Z	bob2	eric123	which part of that page confuses you?
2005-09-17T11:59:00.000Z	bob2	eric123	do not paste in here
2005-09-17T11:59:00.000Z	bob2	eric123	you open a terminal
2005-09-17T11:59:00.000Z	bob2	eric123	applications -> system tools -> terminal

2005-09-17T12:02:00.000Z	bob2	eric123	the one you tried to do now
2005-09-17T12:03:00.000Z	bob2	eric123	then you're copying it wrong
2005-09-17T12:03:00.000Z	bob2	eric123	show us what you're pasting
2005-09-17T12:06:00.000Z	bob2	eric123	that doesn't show us the error at all
