2007-08-21T16:07:00.000Z	Rothgar		Guys quick question what is the difference between LTS and non LTS?
2007-08-21T16:07:00.000Z	Rothgar		I can't seem to find any information on it and I would have thought version 7 would be supported longer than the 6.x branch...
2007-08-21T16:08:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Rothgar	LTS == Long Time Support. The LTS releases are guaranteed to be supported with security fixes etc. for a certain amount of time
2007-08-21T16:08:00.000Z	Rothgar		So 7.x is newer then and will become LTS when 8.x comes out?
2007-08-21T16:08:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Rothgar	no, one of the 8.x releases will be LTS
2007-08-21T16:08:00.000Z	SlimeyPete		(iirc)
2007-08-21T16:09:00.000Z	SlimeyPete		most ubuntu releases aren't LTS
2007-08-21T16:09:00.000Z	Rothgar		Right but one in the 7.x branch will be?
2007-08-21T16:11:00.000Z	Rothgar		I assume the 7.x branch will go for a while then 8.x will come out once 7.x becomes stable and then 7.x will become LTS?
2007-08-21T16:11:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Rothgar	no, AFAIK LTS releases are LTS from the start. I don't think 7.x will ever be LTS.
2007-08-21T16:12:00.000Z	Rothgar		Right, so is it work going 7.04 or 6.06?
2007-08-21T16:12:00.000Z	Rothgar		worth*
2007-08-21T16:12:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Rothgar	for a office workstation or server, 6.06. For a home machine, 7.04.
2007-08-21T16:13:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Rothgar	7.04 is still "supported" with security updates - it's just that there's no guarantee as to how long such support will continue.
2007-08-21T16:13:00.000Z	Rothgar		Well I am going to try ubuntu on the server I am building up it was running Debian, thought I'd give it a shot, so 6.06 then?
2007-08-21T16:14:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Rothgar	yeah, go for 6.06 if you're planning on doing something important with your server
2007-08-21T16:14:00.000Z	SlimeyPete		I still run 6.06 on my home fileserver (havn't bothered to upgrade) and it works fine
2007-08-21T16:15:00.000Z	Rothgar		heh
2007-08-21T16:15:00.000Z	Rothgar		At least I can download it at 1.4MB/s :|
2007-08-21T16:16:00.000Z	Rothgar	SlimeyPete	It'll mainly be used for VMware
2007-08-21T16:16:00.000Z	Rothgar		Not sure if it's going to be any better than Debian for it
2007-08-21T16:17:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Rothgar	probably won't be, tbh. Ubuntu SEvr is basically identical to Debian.
