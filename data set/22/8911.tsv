2005-05-10T07:25:00.000Z	zxc		what's the command to install a .deb? the wiki page on it is 404'd
2005-05-10T07:25:00.000Z	zxc		thanks, does it have to be anywhere in particular?
2005-05-10T07:26:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	you can write it like dpkg -i /path/to/debfile
2005-05-10T07:26:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	so you can do it from any directory
2005-05-19T13:43:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	what kind of file
2005-05-20T12:33:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	your desktop is unresponsive?
2005-05-20T12:33:00.000Z	zxc	Fator_Dee	yes
2005-05-20T12:34:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	execute nautilus
2005-05-20T12:34:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	or look from system monitor if it's there and kill it!
2005-05-20T12:34:00.000Z	zxc	Fator_Dee	using the run command in gnome nothing appears to happen
2005-05-20T12:35:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	a sec
2005-05-20T12:35:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	system -> system monitor
2005-05-20T12:36:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	umm, it *should* be there
2005-05-20T12:37:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	well then, do a ps -A | grep nautilus
2005-05-20T12:37:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	no paste :-p
2005-05-20T12:37:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	kill those numbers
2005-05-20T12:38:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	kill "number"
2005-05-20T12:38:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	you might have to use sudo
2005-05-20T12:41:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	restart nautilus now
2005-05-20T12:42:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	yes
2005-05-20T12:51:00.000Z	zxc	Fator_Dee	I found out what triggers it, if I right click on an icon then go to properties nautilus crashes
2005-05-20T12:52:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	zxc	yah, nautilus is kind of buggy
