2006-08-07T14:01:00.000Z	Warbo	Copter	We said, ask away :)
2006-08-07T14:02:00.000Z	Warbo	Copter	sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin
2006-08-07T14:02:00.000Z	Warbo	Copter	Or use a GUI like System>Admin>Synaptic
2006-08-07T14:03:00.000Z	Warbo	Copter	Follow those instructions to get Universe
2006-08-07T14:05:00.000Z	Warbo	Copter	You have added Universe and reloaded you package lists?
2006-08-07T14:05:00.000Z	Copter	Warbo	yes
2006-08-07T14:05:00.000Z	Warbo	Copter	Hmm, which Ubuntu are you on (version)?
2006-08-07T14:05:00.000Z	Warbo	Copter	Well the "!info packagename" command only gives info on Dapper packages, so I don't know whether it exists in Hoary
2006-08-07T14:06:00.000Z	Copter	Warbo	so what does this mean? LOL
2006-08-07T14:06:00.000Z	Warbo	Copter	It means that it is in Hoary's Universe
2006-08-07T14:07:00.000Z	Copter	Warbo	so why isn't it working for me after adding the universe again?
2006-08-07T14:07:00.000Z	Warbo	Copter	Dunno, you tried using Synaptic or something? (is aptitude in Hoary?)
2006-08-07T14:07:00.000Z	Copter	Warbo	okay -- onto my next question because this one if more important.
2006-08-07T14:08:00.000Z	Warbo	Copter	I would try aptitude then
2006-08-07T14:09:00.000Z	Copter	Warbo	 I have some network equipment that has the option of adding a syslog server IP to send syslogs to -- how would I set up syslogd to do accept this?  I have been trying hardcore to get it working, but I cant seem to do it.  Also -- I have downloaded syslog-ng and the installation had no success for the past four hours or so, so this seems out of the question to use syslog-ng.  Can you please help me with this?
2006-08-07T14:09:00.000Z	Warbo	Copter	Woah! That is way beyond me, sorry
2006-08-07T14:10:00.000Z	Copter	Warbo	could anyone here help me?
2006-08-07T14:10:00.000Z	Warbo	Copter	Try asking the channel (many people don't read messages addressed to specific people)
