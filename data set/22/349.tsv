2011-11-26T11:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	hopp3r	 also you may want to track down some little video that other linux users in here can also try to play.
2011-11-26T11:52:00.000Z	hopp3r	dr_willis	how about, I updated my ubuntu which used to be installed on another PC, whose hard drive I took, and put in my new system (i upgraded the install for possible driver issues)
2011-11-26T11:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	hopp3r	 its possible its a video driver issue. what video card you have?
2011-11-26T11:53:00.000Z	hopp3r	dr_willis	NVIDA something or other
2011-11-26T11:55:00.000Z	hopp3r	dr_willis	heh, I am watching a "legal" version of the simpsons here
2011-11-26T11:56:00.000Z	hopp3r	dr_willis	yeah, I installed one

2011-11-26T11:56:00.000Z	hopp3r	dr_willis	well, not from the package menu
2011-11-26T11:57:00.000Z	hopp3r	dr_willis	I went to the "Additional Drivers" window
2011-11-26T12:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	hopp3r	 in vlc. under tools -> preferances, video. 'output' theres differnt outputs you can try.
2011-11-26T12:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	hopp3r	 also the overlay setting may or may not be an issue
