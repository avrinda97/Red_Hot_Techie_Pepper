2009-02-16T22:55:00.000Z	jose		all: are you sure I don't have to "shrink" my c drive on vista before using a live cd of intrepid ibex to be able to run both vista AND ubuntu on my machine?
2009-02-16T22:55:00.000Z	jose		all: i've read both
2009-02-16T22:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	jose	no; the installer can shrink the partition it is recomended to defrag C: though
2009-02-16T22:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	jose	but you can shrink it from windows beforehand if you want to. it is not neccesary but you can do it
2009-02-16T22:57:00.000Z	jose	erUSUL	thank you.  how much room should the ubuntu part be?  I have one HD which is about 250GB
2010-07-11T16:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	jose	i would fsck the filesystem « sudo touch /forcefsck » reboot
2010-07-11T20:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	jose	"sudo apt-get clean" can give you some space back
2010-07-11T20:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	jose	after that see if /var/ still occupies to much space
2010-07-11T20:30:00.000Z	jose	erUSUL	did that
2010-07-11T20:30:00.000Z	jose	erUSUL	/var/?
2010-07-11T20:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	jose	where logs are kept among other things --> « sudo du -hs /var/ »
2010-07-11T20:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	jose	that's not too much. use Aplications>Admin..>to see where the space is "wasted"
2010-07-11T20:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	jose	no aplications>accesories>disk use analizer
2010-07-11T20:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	jose	so what is complaining about no space left ?
2010-07-11T20:37:00.000Z	jose	erUSUL	started this morning. got error message that i was running out of space
2010-07-11T20:38:00.000Z	jose	erUSUL	checked properties of filesystem flder. says only 3.2GB of space available. it makes no sense to me
2010-07-11T20:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	jose	it may be a filsystem error. pass a fsck tro the partition
2010-07-11T20:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	jose	it may be a filesystem error. pass a fsck to the partition
2010-07-11T20:39:00.000Z	jose	erUSUL	what's the terminal command for that?
2010-07-11T20:39:00.000Z	jose	erUSUL	I love the terminal
2010-07-11T20:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	jose	easiest way if it is the root partition is to do « sudo touch /forcefsck  » and reboot. the fsck will pass during boot
2010-07-11T20:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	jose	the other way is to use a livecd becouse mounted partitions can not be checked
