2005-05-24T06:07:00.000Z	yahalom		how can i download language support .deb packages and burn them to cd?
2005-05-24T06:09:00.000Z	klaas	yahalom	apt-get -d {packages}, maybe it'll get the dependencies too.
2005-05-24T06:09:00.000Z	yahalom	klaas	the whole point is that i wont have an internet connection, so i need to make a cd with the language support to install on site
2005-05-24T06:09:00.000Z	klaas	yahalom	If you run apt-get clean beforehand, you can find the packages in /var/cache/apt/archives
2005-05-24T06:10:00.000Z	klaas	yahalom	When you get them, burn them.
2005-05-24T06:11:00.000Z	klaas	yahalom	A filemanager as well.
2005-05-24T06:13:00.000Z	yahalom	klaas	file manager?
2005-05-24T06:13:00.000Z	klaas	yahalom	Sorry, wrong name.. other discussion.
2005-05-24T06:13:00.000Z	yahalom	klaas	np
2005-05-24T06:14:00.000Z	klaas	yahalom	Yup
2005-05-24T06:16:00.000Z	klaas	yahalom	#apt-get clean && apt-get -d {packages} && cp /var/cache/apt/archives/* .
2005-05-24T06:16:00.000Z	yahalom	klaas	what will that do?
2005-05-24T06:17:00.000Z	klaas	yahalom	Clear the downoaded packages, download the required packages, and copy them to the current dir.
2005-05-24T06:18:00.000Z	yahalom	klaas	u wanted me to copy it the way it was?
2005-05-24T06:19:00.000Z	klaas	yahalom	all packages that are downloaded through apt are stored in /var/cache/apt/archives.
2005-05-24T06:19:00.000Z	klaas	yahalom	apt-get clean removes all packages from that directory. they are not needed since they're already installed.
2005-05-24T06:19:00.000Z	yahalom	klaas	i get u, just it said that {packages} doesn exist
2005-05-24T06:20:00.000Z	klaas	yahalom	{packages} should be replaced with the packages you need..
2005-05-24T06:20:00.000Z	yahalom	klaas	oj
2005-05-24T06:20:00.000Z	yahalom	klaas	ok
2005-05-24T06:21:00.000Z	klaas	yahalom	you might want to create a new dir. in your homedirectory and run the commands from within that directory. there.
