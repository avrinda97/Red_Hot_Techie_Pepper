2005-12-28T13:43:00.000Z	Steil	blanky	I still use slack once in a while for my fileservers, but for desktop I'm probably sticking with ubuntu

2005-12-28T13:46:00.000Z	Steil	blanky	have you prelinked or changed your video driver?
2005-12-28T13:47:00.000Z	blanky	Steil	I downloaded and installed the ati drivers from apt, and they worked, I ran games such as UT2K4 extremely nicely
2005-12-28T13:47:00.000Z	blanky	Steil	however, it's my wndow redrawings
2005-12-28T13:47:00.000Z	blanky	Steil	I was checking my xorg.conf to see if it was a problem in there
2005-12-28T13:47:00.000Z	blanky	Steil	it was alright, then I heard about the backingstop and renderaccel options, I tried and nothing worked (ATI)
2005-12-28T13:48:00.000Z	blanky	Steil	yes
2005-12-28T13:49:00.000Z	blanky	Steil	any ideas? :(

2005-12-28T13:50:00.000Z	blanky	Steil	no, what is that?
2005-12-28T13:50:00.000Z	Steil	blanky	sudo apt-get install prelink
2005-12-28T13:50:00.000Z	blanky	Steil	okay, and then what
