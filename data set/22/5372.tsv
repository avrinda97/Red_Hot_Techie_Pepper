2007-05-15T07:50:00.000Z	IntelleCT	Tom47	I meant apt-get...sorry
2007-05-15T07:50:00.000Z	IntelleCT	Tom47	what's a repos?
2007-05-15T07:51:00.000Z	Tom47	IntelleCT	 repo = repository ... the places where the software "reposes"
2007-05-15T07:51:00.000Z	IntelleCT	Tom47	not sure...where can I get that info?
2007-05-15T07:59:00.000Z	IntelleCT	Tom47	I'm using universe and backports repos
2007-05-15T08:03:00.000Z	IntelleCT	Tom47	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/20916/
2007-05-15T08:08:00.000Z	Tom47	IntelleCT	try starting synaptic and use the reload button
2007-05-15T08:09:00.000Z	Tom47	IntelleCT	cannot see any immediate issue there with that ... you are using the us repositories
2007-05-15T08:09:00.000Z	IntelleCT	Tom47	can I use synaptic from the command line?  I don't have a gui installed.
2007-05-15T08:09:00.000Z	Tom47	IntelleCT	ahhhh
2007-05-15T08:10:00.000Z	Tom47	IntelleCT	no you are stuck with apt-get
2007-05-15T08:10:00.000Z	Tom47	IntelleCT	i really cannot see whay its not working
2007-05-15T08:10:00.000Z	IntelleCT	Tom47	yea, it's weird.  I can ping, ssh, winscp but can't connect to the repos
2007-05-15T08:11:00.000Z	IntelleCT	Tom47	it's a built-in NIC so I'm thinking I should try installing a different NIC
2007-05-15T08:11:00.000Z	Tom47	IntelleCT	yes i can use firefox to get at them as well
2007-05-15T08:12:00.000Z	Tom47	IntelleCT	what is the error message again???
2007-05-15T08:15:00.000Z	IntelleCT	Tom47	it does not reach any of them...that's the same error for all the repos
2007-05-15T08:22:00.000Z	Tom47	IntelleCT	sorry the only thing i would do is to reboot n hope that that might clear its throat
2007-05-15T08:22:00.000Z	IntelleCT	Tom47	that doesn't work either.  I'm stumped
2007-05-15T08:23:00.000Z	IntelleCT	Tom47	thanks for your help
