2008-08-26T18:21:00.000Z	sharperguy		Anyone know how I can connect to a router via USB as opposed to ethernet?
2008-08-26T18:21:00.000Z	Chousuke	sharperguy	usually you don't.
2008-08-26T18:21:00.000Z	Chousuke	sharperguy	unless your router supports USB (never seen one that does)
2008-08-26T18:22:00.000Z	sharperguy	Chousuke	Well this one does...
2008-08-26T18:22:00.000Z	Chousuke		it's not a winmodem, is it?
2008-08-26T18:22:00.000Z	sharperguy		It's a router]
2008-08-26T18:22:00.000Z	Chousuke		routers usually have multiple ethernet ports :/
2008-08-26T18:22:00.000Z	sharperguy		It has 2 ethernet pots
2008-08-26T18:22:00.000Z	sharperguy		*ports, a usb and wifi
2008-08-26T18:22:00.000Z	Chousuke		you should use them
2008-08-26T18:23:00.000Z	sharperguy		dont have enough cables
2008-08-26T18:23:00.000Z	Chousuke		buy some. :p
2008-08-26T18:23:00.000Z	sharperguy		I have like 20 mins to get this done
2008-08-26T18:23:00.000Z	Chousuke		trying to get the USB to work is probably more trouble than trying to get the USB thing to work.
2008-08-26T18:24:00.000Z	Chousuke		*if* the router even supports a network connection over the USB port.
2008-08-26T18:24:00.000Z	Chousuke		which it may not.
2008-08-26T18:24:00.000Z	Chousuke		er hwhh.
2008-08-26T18:24:00.000Z	Chousuke		sorry, my previous sentence was nonsensical :D
2008-08-26T18:24:00.000Z	Chousuke		I meant to say that trying to get the USB port to work is more trouble than buying a cable :p
2008-08-26T18:25:00.000Z	sharperguy	Chousuke	yeah well I have limited time just now
2008-08-26T18:26:00.000Z	Chousuke	sharperguy	do you een have a USB cable to plug the thing into the computer?
2008-08-26T18:26:00.000Z	Chousuke	sharperguy	try doing that first :P
