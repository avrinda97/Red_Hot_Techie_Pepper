2005-06-18T12:37:00.000Z	forsaker8k6		?
2005-06-18T12:37:00.000Z	firasR	forsaker8k6	 however I won't be startin' a flame war about which is better :)

2005-06-18T12:38:00.000Z	forsaker8k6		because GNOME vs KDE is one of the most debated topics on the web i think

2005-06-18T12:41:00.000Z	forsaker8k6		i tryed KDE some time ago.. but i don't liked it
2005-06-18T12:41:00.000Z	forsaker8k6		as someone said: too many K
