2010-03-27T22:13:00.000Z	acicula	donpinto	it defaults to wired over wireless
2010-03-27T22:14:00.000Z	acicula	donpinto	have you setup a wireless network via the network applet in the taskbar?
2010-03-27T22:14:00.000Z	acicula	donpinto	try using the standard ubuntu tools
2010-03-27T22:16:00.000Z	acicula	donpinto	its a lot easier doing it via the nm-applet
2010-03-27T22:17:00.000Z	acicula	donpinto	there is an applet in the taskbar that shows you are connecte
2010-03-27T22:17:00.000Z	acicula	donpinto	quite possibly its already runnin?
2010-03-27T22:17:00.000Z	acicula	donpinto	try it without the ./
2010-03-27T22:18:00.000Z	acicula	donpinto	if you dont have nm-applet you have either a very weird ubuntu, a very old ubuntu or you are not runnin ubuntu at all
2010-03-27T22:19:00.000Z	acicula	donpinto	you have a wired connection? what ubuntu flavour are you using?
2010-03-27T22:19:00.000Z	acicula	donpinto	plug in the network cable and install the packages then, and try again with nm-applet
2010-03-27T22:22:00.000Z	acicula	donpinto	your card is recognized since it shows up, you just seem unable to configure a wireless connection
2010-03-27T22:24:00.000Z	acicula	donpinto	what are you using
