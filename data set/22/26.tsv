2012-11-18T17:01:00.000Z	abailarri		Hi all, I have filezilla in ubuntu 12.04, but it does not work, is unable to connect to any server
2012-11-18T17:03:00.000Z	bekks	abailarri	So whats the error message then - here, filezilla works perfectly.
2012-11-18T17:05:00.000Z	abailarri	bekks	thi is the error:
2012-11-18T17:05:00.000Z	bekks	abailarri	An you are specifying an FTP server?
2012-11-18T17:10:00.000Z	abailarri	bekks	yes, but do not connect to any server
2012-11-18T17:10:00.000Z	bekks	abailarri	Do you have an example server?
2012-11-18T17:11:00.000Z	abailarri	bekks	but are private!
2012-11-18T17:11:00.000Z	bekks	abailarri	Maybe ther do not run on the standard ports.
2012-11-18T17:14:00.000Z	abailarri	bekks	Before, it connected well to these servers
2012-11-18T17:15:00.000Z	abailarri	bekks	The problem appeared yesterday. Began to cease to connect yesterday
2012-11-18T17:15:00.000Z	bekks	abailarri	Did you ensure you are using the correct ports?
2012-11-18T17:15:00.000Z	abailarri	bekks	yes
2012-11-18T17:16:00.000Z	abailarri	bekks	If I try it with Windows, it works perfectly with the same data connection.
2012-11-18T17:16:00.000Z	bekks	abailarri	Do you even have a working networking connection using Ubuntu?
2012-11-18T17:17:00.000Z	abailarri	bekks	yes
2012-11-18T17:26:00.000Z	abailarri	bekks	You know that it is?
2012-11-18T17:26:00.000Z	bekks	abailarri	I know what?
2012-11-18T17:27:00.000Z	abailarri	bekks	my problem with Filezilla
2012-11-18T17:28:00.000Z	bekks	abailarri	I have no further idea, since filezilla is working fine here, and we've stepped through the obvious misconfigurations.
2012-11-18T17:32:00.000Z	abailarri	bekks	i tried with other ftp client with the same configuration, and it works perfectly
2012-11-18T17:33:00.000Z	bekks	abailarri	You could create a bug report then.
2012-11-18T17:33:00.000Z	abailarri	bekks	where?
