2010-10-04T13:09:00.000Z	tgywa		Hi every one
2010-10-04T13:10:00.000Z	tgywa		I can't refirect the output of a binary to a file ... can any one help me ... this is what I treid ...
2010-10-04T13:10:00.000Z	tgywa		root@testrelay:/usr/lib/lmbench/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu# ./bw_tcp localhost > myfile
2010-10-04T13:11:00.000Z	tgywa		hello lovefairuz ... have u seen my question?
2010-10-04T13:12:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tgywa	try  ./bw_tcp localhost >> myfile 2>&1
2010-10-04T13:13:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tgywa	the binary may be writing to "standard error" not just "standard out"
2010-10-04T13:14:00.000Z	tgywa	ilovefairuz	ok .... but ... is that the way ... in other binaries too?
2010-10-04T13:14:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tgywa	depends on the code of each binary
2010-10-04T13:14:00.000Z	tgywa	ilovefairuz	it worked ... many thanks ....
2010-10-25T14:00:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tgywa	top or htop
2010-10-25T14:01:00.000Z	tgywa	ilovefairuz	I am using top ... but seems less summerized?
2010-10-25T14:01:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tgywa	use htop and turn off showing threads from the options
2010-10-25T14:02:00.000Z	tgywa	ilovefairuz	thanks ... but how can I turn of the showing thrreads option.?
2010-10-25T14:03:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tgywa	f2 or use the mouse to click it, works in terminal
2010-10-25T14:11:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tgywa	are you running a multicore machine?
2010-10-25T14:12:00.000Z	tgywa	ilovefairuz	yes
2010-10-25T14:12:00.000Z	tgywa	ilovefairuz	cpu cores       : 2
2010-10-25T14:12:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tgywa	divide these figures by the number of cores to get the true ones
2010-10-25T14:20:00.000Z	tgywa	ilovefairuz	but still it is too high ... even if I divided the load by two. .... load average: 3.20, 5.18, 17.14 ... is like this when there is no major process running ... anything to check?
2010-10-25T14:21:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tgywa	not at all, something is consuming your cpu
2010-10-25T14:22:00.000Z	tgywa	ilovefairuz	I use both top and htop ... but can't see any process using CPU more than 0.0 %
2010-10-25T14:24:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tgywa	are you running compiz?
