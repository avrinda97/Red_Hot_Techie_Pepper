2005-10-16T06:11:00.000Z	nihao		hello, how to know if I have swap partition or not?
2005-10-16T06:12:00.000Z	intelikey	nihao	"free" will tell you if a swap partition is enabled.    "fdisk -l" will tell you if one exists.
2005-10-16T06:21:00.000Z	intelikey	nihao	i said eariler "fdisk -l"  to see if any swap partition exists.
2005-10-16T06:32:00.000Z	intelikey	nihao	`if' /dev/hda8 exists in the output of "fdisk -l /dev/hda" then "sudo mkswap /dev/hda8 ;swapon -a "    if you want swap.....  i don't use swap here.... it slows this thing down.....
2005-10-16T06:36:00.000Z	nihao	intelikey	slept : I am asking for this, because my computer always get frozen with only 2-3 applications open.
2005-10-16T06:37:00.000Z	nihao	intelikey	slept : I have 256mb memory, maybe that's too little. so I think if swap would help.
2005-10-16T06:38:00.000Z	intelikey	nihao	maybe...  but this box only has 98m ram and no swap.   you should boot memtest next time and test your memory sticks
2005-10-16T06:40:00.000Z	nihao	intelikey	amazaing that you run it with 98MB :-) this is annoying me so much that I thought it was a fault in kernel...
2005-10-16T06:41:00.000Z	intelikey	nihao	also you have a non-standard configuration there.    because fdisk -l should never return without listing all parts/hd's
2005-10-16T06:42:00.000Z	intelikey	nihao	i run linux on a laptop with 24m ram and 48m swap
2005-10-16T06:42:00.000Z	nihao	intelikey	sorry, I found previously I didn't use sudo
2005-10-16T06:44:00.000Z	nihao	intelikey	incredible :-) but I don't know how I can fix the problem to my ubuntu package...
2005-10-16T06:44:00.000Z	nihao	intelikey	I use gnome. maybe this is too heavy
2005-10-16T06:45:00.000Z	nihao	intelikey	here is warings from fdisk "The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 9729.
2005-10-16T06:45:00.000Z	nihao	intelikey	does this matter?
2005-10-16T06:47:00.000Z	nihao	intelikey	ok, nice to know.
2005-10-16T06:53:00.000Z	nihao	intelikey	slept : but how to automatically enable swap during booting?
2005-10-16T06:53:00.000Z	intelikey	nihao	it will now.
2005-10-16T06:54:00.000Z	intelikey	nihao	unless you have monkey'd with the scripts in /etc/init.d/ (like i always do) then it will automaticly enable it at boot time.
2005-10-16T06:56:00.000Z	nihao	intelikey	slept : /etc/fstab is as it is now for a long time. but I see the difference in TOP command after I input "swapon" commands as you instructed. so a bit weird to me...
2005-10-16T07:14:00.000Z	intelikey	nihao	danimarquez wine ?    how about you type "sudo apt-get install wine " in a terminal?
2005-10-16T07:16:00.000Z	nihao	intelikey	it doesn't matter. I make the similar mistakes often :)
