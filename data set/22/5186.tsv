2007-06-28T13:52:00.000Z	xbadger		thanks anyway twisties
2007-06-28T13:52:00.000Z	xbadger		I didn't find a solution on forums
2007-06-28T13:53:00.000Z	fisons	xbadger	do you use any special resolutions in xorg? are there any modelines in your yourg.conf?
2007-06-28T13:57:00.000Z	xbadger		thanks for asking fisons, I don't use any special resolution, is the 1024x768@85 Hz wich works fine on my monitor.you see the problem is somehow from xorg because in old dapper version everything wwas fine with same settings. I add the correct modeline using xvidtune but anytime i reboot the settings are lost. somehow the sequence modeline is bypassed in xorg.conf
2007-06-28T13:58:00.000Z	fisons	xbadger	did you try disabling the modeline?
2007-06-28T13:58:00.000Z	xbadger		yes with no luck
2007-06-28T14:00:00.000Z	xbadger	fisons	i found a lot of those problems on ubuntuforums.org but no  one has a good answer for the problem. everyone advice to use modeline but when I reboot the settings are lost. the equence is bypassed in xorg.conf. i don't know why
2007-06-28T14:00:00.000Z	fisons	xbadger	sorry, got no idea - maybe you can find something strange in /var/log/xorg.0.log?
2007-06-28T14:00:00.000Z	xbadger		k thx i tried
2007-06-28T14:01:00.000Z	xbadger		maybe with the next xorg release that thing will be solved
2007-06-28T14:01:00.000Z	xbadger		maybe is some kind of stupid bug
2007-06-28T14:01:00.000Z	fisons	xbadger	did you bugreport it?
2007-06-28T14:02:00.000Z	fisons	xbadger	if you bugreport it, chances it'll be solved raise
2007-06-28T14:02:00.000Z	xbadger	fisons	no but i'll check the bug report list and if it's not listed there i'll post
2007-06-28T14:02:00.000Z	xbadger		thx man hope will be resolve
2007-06-28T14:02:00.000Z	fisons	xbadger	yes ;) good luck
2007-06-28T14:03:00.000Z	xbadger		untill then i stick to 1024x768@75
2007-06-28T14:03:00.000Z	fisons	xbadger	could it be your modeline is somehow invalid?
2007-06-28T14:04:00.000Z	xbadger		i don't think so because it is generated with xvidtune
2007-06-28T14:04:00.000Z	xbadger		show option
2007-06-28T14:04:00.000Z	xbadger		i heard that the new xorg does not support the modeline thing
2007-06-28T14:04:00.000Z	fisons	xbadger	ok, understand
