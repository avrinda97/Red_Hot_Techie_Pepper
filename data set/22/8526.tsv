2005-09-12T16:14:00.000Z	test34		did anybody created a package to make lexmark z33 driver installation easier ? (it's kind of messed up from what I'm reading right now..)
2005-09-12T14:35:00.000Z	test34		by default ubuntu don't have a firewall ?
2005-09-12T14:35:00.000Z	nalioth	test34	by default, the firewall isnt enabled
2005-09-12T14:36:00.000Z	test34	nalioth	shouldnt it have a stateful packet inspection install by default ?
2005-09-12T14:37:00.000Z	nalioth	test34	ubuntu was meant for desktop use, not for hardcore server folks (although it can be run in that capacity easily)
2005-09-12T14:38:00.000Z	test34	nalioth	I'm talking about desktop.. like the firewall included with windows xp
2005-09-12T14:38:00.000Z	nalioth	test34	iptables is an integral part of any linux distro

2005-09-12T14:38:00.000Z	test34	nalioth	I know, but shouldn't it be enabled by default
2005-09-12T14:39:00.000Z	nalioth	test34	by default, there is nothing listening on an ubuntu install
2005-09-12T14:40:00.000Z	test34	nalioth	yeah but you don't need to be a server to have apps that listen to a port.. I still think it should be enabled..
2005-09-12T14:40:00.000Z	test34	nalioth	for example, xchat is installed by default
2005-09-12T14:42:00.000Z	nalioth	test34	as mentioned. iptables is available for your use (firewall, internet sharing, etc) but not enabled by default (cuz nothing is listening to the door for the knock)
2005-09-12T14:42:00.000Z	test34	nalioth	and if you only have stateful inspection, a server would not work by default
2005-09-12T14:43:00.000Z	nalioth	test34	yer talkin over my head, hoss
2005-09-12T14:43:00.000Z	test34	nalioth	you are.. are you a bot or something
2005-09-12T14:44:00.000Z	nalioth	test34	what?
2005-09-15T09:33:00.000Z	nalioth	test34	obvious question: is it installed?
2005-09-15T09:33:00.000Z	test34	nalioth	yes
2005-09-15T09:34:00.000Z	nalioth	test34	breezy is still rough around the edges
2005-09-15T09:34:00.000Z	test34	nalioth	open-ssh-client and open-ssh-server and ssh
2005-09-19T16:05:00.000Z	nalioth	test34	w32codecs
