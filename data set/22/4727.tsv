2008-12-18T07:38:00.000Z	Etherael		is there a way to stop automounting under ~/.gvfs and mount under /mnt instead? annoying to try and access files in mounted filesystems when all mounted filesystems are under a hidden directory.
2008-12-18T07:39:00.000Z	fryguy	Etherael	you shouldn't be manipulating .gvfs manually
2008-12-18T07:39:00.000Z	Etherael	fryguy	Why not?
2008-12-18T07:40:00.000Z	fryguy	Etherael	it's a virtual filesystem
2008-12-18T07:40:00.000Z	Etherael	fryguy	so I should scrap it and just use smbmount / nfs whatever if I actually want to really use it like a real filesystem and .gvfs is just there for pose value?
2008-12-18T07:41:00.000Z	fryguy	Etherael	what exactly are you doing that makes you think you need to be using .gvfs
2008-12-18T07:41:00.000Z	Etherael	fryguy	I have a codebase under windows on a vm that I want to edit files on and keep under RCS with git, so I just use the VM to run IIS and otherwise forget about it, and run jEdit / git on my linux desktop to actually do work.
2008-12-18T07:42:00.000Z	fryguy	Etherael	so use samba
2008-12-18T07:42:00.000Z	Etherael	fryguy	it seems work fine when I just cd into the directories under .gvfs and treat it like a real filesystem, like I was able to git init git add git commit and also jedit all my source files.
2008-12-18T07:43:00.000Z	Etherael	fryguy	why does "connect to server" use gvfs if it's a better idea to use samba?
2008-12-18T07:43:00.000Z	fryguy	Etherael	why not just run git on windows and remote branch?  pretty offtopic but whatever
2008-12-18T07:43:00.000Z	Etherael	fryguy	cause then I'd actually have to use windows to do the RCS instead of what I do now which is just run the server in the background and just use it as a server only and otherwise forget about it.
2008-12-18T07:43:00.000Z	fryguy	Etherael	it isn't a better idea.  gnome needs a way to dynamically create mounts to display to a user in nautilus, and so it uses a hidden directory called .gvfs for that purpose.
2008-12-18T07:44:00.000Z	Etherael	fryguy	So in what sense is an smb filesystem mounted under ~/.gvfs/ via fuse.gvfs different to an smb filesystem mounted using smbmount under /mnt? different drivers?
2008-12-18T07:45:00.000Z	fryguy	Etherael	one, it's fuse, two, it's permissions are different, 3 it's non-persistent
2008-12-18T07:46:00.000Z	Etherael	fryguy	Non persistent? ... if you make changes to the filesystem while it's mounted under fuse, they persist after unmounting, so I can only assume you mean you have to remount it every reboot or something manually?
2008-12-18T07:46:00.000Z	fryguy	Etherael	if you restart gnome it's gone
2008-12-18T07:46:00.000Z	fryguy	Etherael	the mount that is
2008-12-18T07:48:00.000Z	fryguy	Etherael	right.  It has to get mounted somewhere so that gnome programs can manipulate the mounted files.  Gnome handles the mounting for you
2008-12-18T07:48:00.000Z	Etherael	fryguy	OK, so can I tell gnome to mount it somewhere else?
2008-12-18T07:48:00.000Z	fryguy	Etherael	if you want to handle the mounting yourself, use the standard mechanisms (mount, smbmount, fstab, etc)
2008-12-18T07:48:00.000Z	fryguy	Etherael	no idea, i don't use gnome
