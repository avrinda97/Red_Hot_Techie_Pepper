2007-02-08T10:11:00.000Z	shmeelAway		hi, does any1 know a script that allows me to open things as root with a right click and going to script?
2007-02-08T10:12:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	you mean like open it in a text editor as root? I have something like that...
2007-02-08T10:13:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	in a text editor as root? I have a script that does that, I can pastebin it and tell you where to put it.
2007-02-08T10:13:00.000Z	shmeelAway	cables	sure, thanks
2007-02-08T10:17:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/4684/
2007-02-08T10:17:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	take out the line numbers first though
2007-02-08T10:18:00.000Z	shmeelAway	cables	where do i put the file?
2007-02-08T10:18:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts
2007-02-08T10:21:00.000Z	shmeelAway	cables	didn't work =.=
2007-02-08T10:22:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	run this command: killall nautilus
2007-02-08T10:22:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	then right click on something and look at the scripts submenu
2007-02-08T10:26:00.000Z	shmeelAway	cables	still not there -.-
2007-02-08T10:26:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	i'm going to look into something
2007-02-08T10:26:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	you don't need to edit anything...
2007-02-08T10:27:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	this script is for making you not have to use that command
2007-02-08T10:28:00.000Z	shmeelAway	cables	i have that script already aparently, but i just wnated something so that i could open say my external harddrive as root
2007-02-08T10:29:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	then you change gedit to nautilus.
2007-02-08T10:30:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	make a copy of the script, rename it something different, and edit it so that it opens nautilus and not gedit
2007-02-08T10:33:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	no problem
2007-03-12T09:28:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	in the advanced volume settings, do you see a "headphones" slider or something like that?
2007-03-12T09:29:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	I had that problem, and someone told me how to fix it... but I don't remember it now.
2007-03-12T09:37:00.000Z	cables	shmeelAway	here
