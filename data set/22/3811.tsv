2008-05-24T20:41:00.000Z	keyplute		zanberdo...three times...yep, CD is good, and just to amke sure downloaded bother versions again
2008-05-24T20:41:00.000Z	keyplute		same problem
2008-05-24T20:41:00.000Z	DrBanzai	keyplute	How old is the target computer?
2008-05-24T20:42:00.000Z	keyplute	DrBanzai	 It's a P4 2.0, 2 40 GB Hard Drives (no dual boot or anything, just want a second drive in linux for extra storage, 1 GB Ram
2008-05-24T20:43:00.000Z	keyplute		Zanberdo...Install crashes at 6% with Fatal Error Everytime with alternate install.....and with the normal install, it doesn't give me a percent, starts to install, and crashes, and returns back to the Live CD Icon
2008-05-24T20:43:00.000Z	DrBanzai	keyplute	And it always stops at 6%, regardless of which cd you use?
2008-05-24T20:44:00.000Z	keyplute	DrBanzai	 alternate always stops at 6% with the linux red screen of death
2008-05-24T20:44:00.000Z	DrBanzai	keyplute	What was on the drive before?
2008-05-24T20:44:00.000Z	keyplute	DrBanzai	 Regardless of One IDE hard Drive, or two hard drives connected, and regardless of which hard drive I use
2008-05-24T20:45:00.000Z	keyplute		Had a hardy install on one of the drives (different config) and XP was on the second drive.  However, I used Ultimate Boot CD to wipe partition tables, boot sectors, and performed low level formats on each drive.  THat waas my first thought was maybe a grub issue
2008-05-24T20:46:00.000Z	DrBanzai	keyplute	Hmmmm...well, the only thing I can think of to try would be to burn a new cd, and about 2x and see if that works.
2008-05-24T20:46:00.000Z	keyplute	DrBanzai	 If this helps any...whenever the launcher starts to install, I am getting an ACPI error as well
2008-05-24T20:47:00.000Z	DrBanzai	keyplute	In that case, at the boot prompt type no=acpi
2008-05-24T20:47:00.000Z	DrBanzai	keyplute	Or maybe just no acpi
2008-05-24T20:47:00.000Z	keyplute		What does the ACPI do?
2008-05-24T20:48:00.000Z	DrBanzai	keyplute	It's something to do with power management, and some implimentations are buggy
2008-05-24T20:48:00.000Z	keyplute		Alright, well I will try everything again...it is just hard, because of course it gets past the partitioning, so it's a pain to go back and destroy partition tables everytime it fails...but I do, to make sure that it's not a GRUB issue
2008-05-24T20:49:00.000Z	DrBanzai	keyplute	Good luck
