2009-12-30T00:48:00.000Z	James_-_		I have a windows xp home system (inlaws computer) that I want to SSH in to from my ubuntu however in a few hours I will be leaving and be over 400 miles away.... What I need is a recommendation for OpenSSH server for Windows and also a recommendation for some kind of program that will allow me to find out what the IP address is remotely... ANy idea? I have never done any SSH on a Windows system
2009-12-30T00:49:00.000Z	llutz	James_-_	try openssh in cygwin (slow) or freesshd (native win)
2009-12-30T00:50:00.000Z	llutz	James_-_	for ip, use dyndns.org or no-ip.com account
2009-12-30T00:50:00.000Z	James_-_	llutz	thanks will look in to freesshd...
2010-01-13T22:46:00.000Z	llutz	James_-_	man sshd_config
2010-01-13T22:46:00.000Z	James_-_	llutz	what will i be changing there
2010-01-13T22:47:00.000Z	llutz	James_-_	read it
2010-01-13T22:47:00.000Z	James_-_	llutz	ok will do
2010-01-13T22:52:00.000Z	llutz	James_-_	if sshd_config won't fit your needs, use /etc/hosts.allow
2010-01-13T22:54:00.000Z	James_-_	llutz	is sshd_config am i wanting to change the listenAddress ?
2010-01-13T22:55:00.000Z	llutz	James_-_	if you have several IPs, you can. AllowUser/DenyUser or groups with ip-ranges would work too
2010-01-13T22:58:00.000Z	llutz	James_-_	then use /etc/hosts.allow "sshd: 192.168.x."
2010-01-13T22:58:00.000Z	llutz	James_-_	replace with your network
2010-01-13T22:59:00.000Z	llutz	James_-_	and make sure to have "ALL: ALL: DENY" in /etc/hosts.deny
2010-01-13T23:00:00.000Z	llutz	James_-_	yup
2010-01-13T23:02:00.000Z	James_-_	llutz	this is a fresh install and there isn't anything in my hosts.allow file, do i need to do anything other than open it in an editor and add a line at the end?
2010-01-13T23:02:00.000Z	llutz	James_-_	no, just "sudo nano /etc/hosts.allow" to make your changes
2010-01-13T23:03:00.000Z	llutz	James_-_	nothing special with that file, except i think you cannot use cidr notation for networks
2010-01-13T23:09:00.000Z	James_-_	llutz	you said before "and make sure to have "ALL: ALL: DENY" in /etc/hosts.deny"  will that deny any and all request to anything unless I allow it in Allow, thereby requiring me to add allows for everything else i want to do like run a SAMBA server ?
2010-01-13T23:13:00.000Z	James_-_	llutz	ok I did what we talked about above and now where I could ssh in before i get connection closed by remote host
2010-01-13T23:16:00.000Z	James_-_	llutz	ok I did what we talked about above and now where I could ssh in before i get connection closed by remote host thoughts anyone?
