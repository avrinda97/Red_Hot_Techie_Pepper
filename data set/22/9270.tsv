2005-01-17T09:59:00.000Z	ObsidianX		hey why does the ubuntu not detect any partitions past 1?
2005-01-17T10:00:00.000Z	ObsidianX		ubuntu install cd*
2005-01-17T10:00:00.000Z	ObsidianX		its loading the correct module for my ide bus
2005-01-17T10:01:00.000Z	ObsidianX		but then only /dev/ide/blah/blah/blah/part1 and disc are shown
2005-01-17T10:03:00.000Z	ObsidianX		if i could make a block device pointing to the other partitions that would probably fix it but i dont know what the major/minor numbers are for partitions
2005-01-17T10:04:00.000Z	subterrific	ObsidianX	so basically your problem is that udev isn't creating a /dev/hdXN entry for the drive?
2005-01-17T10:08:00.000Z	ObsidianX	subterrific	any ideas?
2005-01-17T10:08:00.000Z	subterrific	ObsidianX	you're having this problem when you're booted off the install cd?
2005-01-17T10:11:00.000Z	ObsidianX	subterrific	if i knew what the minor numbers for the partitions were i could create the block devices myself
2005-01-17T10:13:00.000Z	subterrific	ObsidianX	why are you even using the console on the install cd?
2005-01-17T10:13:00.000Z	subterrific	ObsidianX	just run through the installer...
2005-01-17T10:15:00.000Z	subterrific	ObsidianX	?
2005-01-17T10:15:00.000Z	ObsidianX	subterrific	i've resorted to the console because the graphical can't seem to make the devices on its own
2005-01-17T10:17:00.000Z	subterrific	ObsidianX	so when you get to the partition step it shows no devices?
2005-01-17T10:17:00.000Z	ObsidianX	subterrific	oh it finds the partitions in the partitioner, but only because its reading from the 'disc' or 'hda' file
2005-01-17T10:19:00.000Z	subterrific	ObsidianX	define nothing works
2005-01-17T10:19:00.000Z	subterrific	ObsidianX	like it won't partition the drives?
2005-01-17T10:19:00.000Z	subterrific	ObsidianX	or it won't install packages
2005-01-17T10:24:00.000Z	ObsidianX	subterrific	wont partition/mount the drive
2005-01-17T10:25:00.000Z	subterrific	ObsidianX	are you trying to do a custom partition scheme or just the default?
2005-01-17T10:25:00.000Z	ObsidianX	subterrific	custom
2005-01-19T15:58:00.000Z	subterrific	ObsidianX	i'm here now
