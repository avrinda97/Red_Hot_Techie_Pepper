2005-02-05T10:01:00.000Z	Djm		stupid install question to you lot..but which kernel?
2005-02-05T10:01:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	default, to start with.  at least, that's what I do.
2005-02-05T10:02:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	the one you don't specify.  :)
2005-02-05T10:03:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	uh, it never asks me.  How did you get to that point?  :)
2005-02-05T10:03:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	I assume you have a Warty install Cd, yes?
2005-02-05T10:03:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	x86?
2005-02-05T10:04:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	uh... can you describe where you are in the installation process?  have you already specified a disk, done the partitioning, etc?
2005-02-05T10:04:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	oh, you're ahead of me.  keep typing.  :)
2005-02-05T10:05:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	have you already rebooted?
2005-02-05T10:05:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	oh - I meant that you were answering my question before I asked it; not that I had no idea how to help (which might also be true).
2005-02-05T10:06:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	which kernels is it offering to you?
2005-02-05T10:06:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	sorry; I didn't see your post.
2005-02-05T10:07:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	I have no idea why it's asking at all, but I'd pick linux-image-2.6.8.1-3-386 if I were you.
2005-02-05T10:08:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	I would.
2005-02-05T10:11:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	are you installing to a regular EIDE disk, a scsi disk, or something else crazy?
2005-02-05T10:14:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	np
2005-02-05T10:14:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	good luck.
2005-02-05T10:14:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	getting a better drive might double your XP uptime
2005-02-05T10:14:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	but it will expand your Ubuntu installability and uptime almost infinitely  ;)
2005-02-05T10:15:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	oh, I understand.  You can't install XP either.
2005-02-05T10:15:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	sounds like a new HDD is the way to go
2005-02-05T10:16:00.000Z	moquist	Djm	true HW problems tend to be really weird.
