2007-03-26T05:34:00.000Z	jrib	mihailo	I'm not sure what you are asking, but I'm sure the answer is probably either tab, space, or enter
2007-03-26T05:35:00.000Z	jrib	mihailo	or the arrow keys
2007-03-26T05:37:00.000Z	mihailo	jrib	can i pm you about this?
2007-03-26T05:38:00.000Z	jrib	mihailo	it's better if you ask here so everyone can help
2007-03-26T05:39:00.000Z	mihailo	jrib	ok, so... basically i love ubuntu but i have 2 problems that i cannot solve
2007-03-26T05:52:00.000Z	jrib	mihailo	have you followed the wiki guide to install the nvidia drivers?
2007-03-26T05:53:00.000Z	jrib	mihailo	what was the result?
2007-03-26T05:55:00.000Z	jrib	mihailo	which step are you on on the wiki?
2007-03-26T06:20:00.000Z	mihailo	jrib	hi again! i get stuck at step no10 i think. when nvidia writes the xorg file, the x server chrashes with this:  cant start x: api mismatch, nvidia kernel module is 1.0-9755 while xmodule is 1.0-9746
2007-03-26T06:21:00.000Z	jrib	mihailo	are you using the official ubuntu repositories only and installing nvidia-glx from there?
2007-03-26T06:22:00.000Z	mihailo	jrib	im now in recovery mode so i cant check synaptic
2007-03-26T06:22:00.000Z	jrib	mihailo	apt-cache policy nvidia-glx
2007-03-26T06:23:00.000Z	mihailo	jrib	nvidia-glx:
2007-03-26T06:24:00.000Z	mihailo	jrib	nvidia-glx:
2007-03-26T06:25:00.000Z	jrib	mihailo	yeah, you're using albertmilone's repo.  I don't know how to fix this right away.  Using 'envy' might take care of it or someone here might know more
2007-03-26T06:26:00.000Z	mihailo	jrib	i tried using envy but it cant find my card... and when i try manuall install it also chrashes x server
2007-03-26T06:26:00.000Z	jrib	mihailo	use official repositories then, that's my suggestion
2007-03-26T06:27:00.000Z	mihailo	jrib	ok, will do. but what now? should I uninstall something?
2007-03-26T06:28:00.000Z	jrib	mihailo	maybe this can help you http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Latest_Nvidia_Edgy .  I'm just pointing you at docs because I don't have any experience here
2007-03-26T06:28:00.000Z	jrib	mihailo	the part about kernel upgrades will probably fix your issue
