2006-01-09T16:23:00.000Z	GodIsDead		Hello
2006-01-09T16:24:00.000Z	GodIsDead		I'm somewhat new to Linux, and am trying to run Ubuntu from an external hard drive.
2006-01-09T16:24:00.000Z	GodIsDead		While http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=80811 is a great post, it doesn't appear to have much info on how to boot to a USB device if one's BIOS doesn't support USB booting.
2006-01-09T16:25:00.000Z	GodIsDead		Using the Ubuntu install disk as a Boot Disc, is their a command I can use to boot to the usb device?
2006-01-09T16:27:00.000Z	GodIsDead		? Anyone have any ideas?
2006-01-09T16:28:00.000Z	GodIsDead		What procedure/commands to use when trying to use the Install CD as a Boot Disc to boot to an external USB device.
2006-01-09T16:29:00.000Z	mwe	GodIsDead	you installed ubuntu to an external disk?
2006-01-09T16:30:00.000Z	GodIsDead	mwe	 Thanks for helping!
2006-01-09T16:31:00.000Z	GodIsDead	mwe	 Finished installing as per the http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=80811 instructions
2006-01-09T16:31:00.000Z	GodIsDead	mwe	The problem is that my computer doesn't support USB booting, so I can't go to the next and final phase.
2006-01-09T16:32:00.000Z	mwe	GodIsDead	Well then I think you have a problem
2006-01-09T16:32:00.000Z	GodIsDead	mwe	 But I've read that it is possible to use the Install CD as a boot disk to load to a device regardless of whether the BIOS supports it natively.
2006-01-09T16:33:00.000Z	GodIsDead	mwe	 So while it *would* be a pain in the arse to re-type commands every time I want to reboot, it is possible to circumvent the BIOS to do so.
2006-01-09T16:33:00.000Z	GodIsDead	mwe	 I mean, I was definitely able to access and edit the files on the external using "rescue"...
2006-01-09T16:34:00.000Z	mwe	GodIsDead	it's not a problem to mount the disk and access the files. it's the booting part I'm worried about
2006-01-09T16:36:00.000Z	GodIsDead	mwe	 ...  it is quite possible that my def of "booting" is imprecise or inacurate.  In my mind the goal is to just get into the GUI without having a bunch of stuff running in the background.  Just find a way to load mount the device and then jump into using it fully.
2006-01-09T16:37:00.000Z	mwe	GodIsDead	I have never tried myself, but I read about smart boot manager. I think maybe it can do it
2006-01-09T16:38:00.000Z	mwe	GodIsDead	http://linux.simple.be/tools/sbm. I don't know if it supports usb drives though.
2006-01-09T16:38:00.000Z	GodIsDead	mwe	 I'll look into Smart Boot Manager - it certainly helps that I can have a live cd to play with - but somebody at my local usergroup mentioned (http://olylug.com/olug/read.php?1,280) "So will the Ubuntu install, I put on an external hard-disk, boot with a Breezy Badger install disk if I type: linux root=/dev/sda2"
2006-01-09T16:49:00.000Z	GodIsDead	mwe	SBM doesn't do USB, I regret.
2006-01-09T16:50:00.000Z	mwe	GodIsDead	too bad :|
2006-01-09T16:50:00.000Z	GodIsDead	mwe	Any other boot disks, or a way to properly use the install disc as a boot disc?
