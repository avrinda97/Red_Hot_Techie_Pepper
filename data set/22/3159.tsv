2011-06-28T11:19:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	morth	the great thing about Linux is that you can really take control of your machine
2011-06-28T11:20:00.000Z	morth	noisewaterphd	i agree, i feel win7 is holding me back.
2011-06-28T11:23:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	morth	there is a really great book that I always recommend to new *nix folks called Unix Power Tools. That book is a great start to learning the power of your new OS of choice
