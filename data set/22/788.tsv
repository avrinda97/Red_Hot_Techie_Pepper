2011-05-05T23:07:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	You came to the right place :)
2011-05-05T23:07:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	what card do you have?
2011-05-05T23:08:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	broadcom bcm43XX ???
2011-05-05T23:08:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	yes pm me
2011-07-21T00:23:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	virtual box is in the repos.  But how did you install it?
2011-07-21T00:23:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	Can you be more specific
2011-07-21T00:23:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	it is yes
2011-07-21T00:24:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	It's in universe  (but this probably won't help us remove it)
2011-07-21T00:24:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	sure :)
2011-07-21T00:25:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	complete removal removes settings files in /etc/ and such as well as the actual program executable
2011-07-21T00:25:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	virtual box is not dual boot :)
2011-07-21T00:26:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	It allows you to run two os's at the same time on one machine
2011-07-21T00:26:00.000Z	mang0	edbian	exactly, i'm deleting vb in favour of dual boot
2011-07-21T00:26:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	ahhh :)
2011-07-21T00:26:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	Sure, was virtual box installed via repos?
2011-07-21T00:26:00.000Z	mang0	edbian	yes, I remember reading the description now
2011-07-21T00:28:00.000Z	mang0	edbian	I used to dual boot winXP and ubuntu, but my computer messed up, had to reformat both hdds, I reinstalled ubuntu and now I'm reinstalling windows after trying VB :P
2011-07-21T00:28:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	You can install something in the terminal from the repos. I do it all the time
2011-07-21T00:28:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	FYI, this is going to mess up your bootloader grub but it is a known issue and there is a fix.
2011-07-21T00:29:00.000Z	mang0	edbian	I know, I've done it before
2011-07-21T00:29:00.000Z	edbian	mang0	oh good :)
