2006-08-08T09:17:00.000Z	timothy		can anyone help me with a problem mounting a hard drive?
2006-08-08T09:18:00.000Z	Khamael	timothy	what is the problem?
2006-08-08T09:20:00.000Z	Khamael	timothy	have you formatted it?
2006-08-08T09:21:00.000Z	Khamael	timothy	well, you have to format it first. you in ubuntu now?
2006-08-08T09:26:00.000Z	Khamael	timothy	try "sudo apt-get install gparted"
2006-08-08T09:27:00.000Z	timothy	Khamael	OK, installed
2006-08-08T09:27:00.000Z	Khamael	timothy	have you ever used partition magic?
2006-08-08T09:27:00.000Z	timothy	Khamael	no
2006-08-08T09:28:00.000Z	Khamael	timothy	then I suggest you either read "man gparted" or find yourself a good how-to before you proceed
2006-08-08T09:28:00.000Z	Khamael	timothy	when you are ready, you type "sudo gparted"
2006-08-08T09:29:00.000Z	Khamael	timothy	but don`t do anything without knowing what you are doing
2006-08-08T09:29:00.000Z	Khamael	timothy	that said, gparted is easy touse
2006-08-08T09:30:00.000Z	timothy	Khamael	ok, thanks. If I just want to have one partition taking the entire disk, is there a simple way to do this? I have used partitioners before, just not partition magic.
2006-08-08T09:30:00.000Z	Khamael	timothy	run "sudo gparted" and have a look
2006-08-08T09:30:00.000Z	timothy	Khamael	I don't want an OS install or anything, just a place for file storage
2006-08-08T09:31:00.000Z	Khamael	timothy	it is a matter of clicking on the right partition and selecting format to ext3 or something like that
2006-08-08T09:31:00.000Z	timothy	Khamael	I have, and it looks simple to use. I gues the only question I'm asking is if there needs to be some small special partition to allow mounting later on
2006-08-08T09:32:00.000Z	Khamael	timothy	on my system I have 3 partitions, 30GB,50GB and 200 GB
2006-08-08T09:33:00.000Z	Khamael	timothy	I don`t excactly know what you mean. you can have as small or large partitions you like
2006-08-08T09:33:00.000Z	timothy	Khamael	ok, nevermind, my question was irrelevent. thanks for your help
2006-08-08T09:33:00.000Z	Khamael	timothy	np
2006-08-08T09:54:00.000Z	timothy	Khamael	I have formatted the hard drive and i see it as such in fdisk, but i am still unable to mount the drive
