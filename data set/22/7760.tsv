2006-01-04T06:27:00.000Z	Seveas	Draken	did you perhaps do a server install?
2006-01-04T06:27:00.000Z	Seveas	Draken	odd, are you in the admin group (the id command should tell)
2006-01-04T06:28:00.000Z	Seveas	Draken	then check later, the user created when installing should be in the admin group
2006-01-06T12:57:00.000Z	Seveas	Draken	then apt-get update && apt-get install nvidia-glx
2006-01-06T12:57:00.000Z	Draken	Seveas	im not a idiot
2006-01-06T12:58:00.000Z	Seveas	Draken	and why doesn't it download?
2006-01-06T12:58:00.000Z	Draken	Seveas	i dont know, it just says getting headers 0%
2006-01-06T12:59:00.000Z	Seveas	Draken	and any other apt-get install works?
2006-01-06T12:59:00.000Z	Seveas	Draken	apt-cache policy nvidia-glx
2006-01-06T13:00:00.000Z	Draken	Seveas	i cant
2006-01-06T13:00:00.000Z	Seveas	Draken	command line works too
2006-01-06T13:01:00.000Z	Seveas	Draken	that says very little
