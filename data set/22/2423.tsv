2009-06-15T08:47:00.000Z	wizzo50		Does anyone know how to setup the security McAfee that I am registered with through my broadband service, Windstream?
2009-06-15T08:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	on ubuntu?
2009-06-15T08:48:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	I don't believe you can use that on linux and you wouldn't need to either
2009-06-15T08:50:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	yes
2009-06-15T08:50:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	an antivirus isn't needed, and a firewall is provided by default
2009-06-15T08:51:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	do you have a router?
2009-06-15T08:53:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	the router should provide a firewall
2009-06-15T08:55:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	I said that
2009-06-15T08:55:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	it's ubuntu, not unbuntu
2009-07-26T13:18:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	please don't shout "help".  It depends on what you downloaded
2009-07-26T13:18:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	particularly what format it is
2009-07-26T13:19:00.000Z	wizzo50	lstarnes	Anything, just as if your on WIndows with firefox.
2009-07-26T13:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	it still depends on the file format and what it is
2009-07-26T13:19:00.000Z	wizzo50	lstarnes	*.exe
2009-07-26T13:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	ubuntu doesn't use .exe natively
2009-07-26T13:20:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	you have to use wine if you want to run .exe files in ubuntu
2009-09-04T08:21:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	tar xzf file.tar.gz
2009-09-04T08:37:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	isn't pulseaudio installed by default?
2009-09-04T08:38:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	you may need to check the mixer settings
2009-09-04T08:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	have you tried https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting ?
2009-09-04T08:49:00.000Z	lstarnes	wizzo50	try changing all of them (except the last dropbox) to PulseAudio Sound Server
