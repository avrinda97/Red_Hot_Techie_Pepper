2008-01-18T13:53:00.000Z	BloodyScum		i just installed some updates, and now my azureus wont open.. every time i clike it nothing happens, so i tried typing in the terminal "azuerus" and got "The program 'SWT' received an X Window System error.  This probably reflects a bug in the program.  The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'. (Details: serial 261 error_code 11 request_code 148 minor_code 5)

2008-01-18T13:53:00.000Z	BloodyScum		sorry for so many lines
2008-01-18T13:54:00.000Z	_sidd	BloodyScum	Yes... I'm having problems with eclipse... seems like the most recent xserver update doesn't seem to work with java (graphical apps).
2008-01-18T13:55:00.000Z	BloodyScum	_sidd	is there a way to roll baxk the xserver update untill this is fixed?
2008-01-18T13:56:00.000Z	_sidd	BloodyScum	I am looking to do exactly that... looking at some forums right now...
2008-01-18T13:56:00.000Z	_sidd	BloodyScum	Let me know if you find anything.
2008-01-18T13:56:00.000Z	BloodyScum	_sidd	ok, you to
2008-01-18T13:57:00.000Z	_sidd	BloodyScum	There is a way to install a specific version of a package with apt-get... but I don't know what the previous version of the xserver.
2008-01-18T13:58:00.000Z	BloodyScum	_sidd	W_McL no i dont, and is there an update log?
2008-01-18T14:04:00.000Z	_sidd	BloodyScum	Right... but the basic error seems to be the BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation) from the xserver.
2008-01-18T14:07:00.000Z	_sidd	BloodyScum	W_McL: The bugreport lists the previous version of the xserver that the guy backed off to. We can do the same.
2008-01-18T14:10:00.000Z	_sidd	BloodyScum	I tried sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-core=1.3.0.0.dfsg-12ubuntu8, but it can't find that version. :-|
2008-01-18T14:11:00.000Z	BloodyScum	_sidd	W_McL: well maybe we can find the package without apt-get
2008-01-18T14:12:00.000Z	_sidd	BloodyScum	Good idea.
2008-01-18T14:17:00.000Z	_sidd	BloodyScum	W_McL: Aha! I managed to downgrade the xserver.
2008-01-18T14:18:00.000Z	_sidd	BloodyScum	W_McL: sudo aptitude install xserver-xorg-core=2:1.3.0.0.dfsg-12ubuntu8
2008-01-18T14:20:00.000Z	_sidd	BloodyScum	Yea... now to check if that worked... see you in a bit.
2008-01-18T14:24:00.000Z	BloodyScum	_sidd	u here?
2008-01-18T14:27:00.000Z	_sidd	BloodyScum	W_McL: Phew! It works... good to have eclipse working again.
2008-01-18T14:28:00.000Z	BloodyScum	_sidd	W_McL: yeah it worked, nice job
2008-01-18T14:30:00.000Z	_sidd	BloodyScum	See ya.
