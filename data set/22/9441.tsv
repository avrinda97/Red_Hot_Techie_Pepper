2004-11-06T08:32:00.000Z	dayson		I need the fonts for a windows program I am runing in cedega
2004-11-06T08:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dayson	Have you checked in synaptic t see if it's available as a deb?
2004-11-06T08:33:00.000Z	dayson	thoreauputic	its not there
2004-11-06T08:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dayson	what is it? win ttf fonts or something like that?
2004-11-06T08:33:00.000Z	dayson	thoreauputic	yes its msfonts
2004-11-06T08:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dayson	see if you can find a package called msttcorefonts
2004-11-06T08:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dayson	I'm on debian , so it may be that package isn't available on ubuntu - but a deb for it exists
2004-11-06T08:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dayson	it enables you to install ms fonts
2004-11-06T08:37:00.000Z	dayson	thoreauputic	I found msttcorefonts and I'm installing that
