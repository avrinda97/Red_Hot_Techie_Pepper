2005-06-24T13:21:00.000Z	simone		Hi... did my first ubuntu install ever. First experience with debian ... very limited experience with Mandrake Linux. I tried to run an AVI- file but got the following message: Totem could not play file due to missing decoders. What should I do?
2005-06-24T13:22:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	take a look at wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2005-06-25T08:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	does sound in other applications work?
2005-06-25T08:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	e.g., do you hear the startup ubuntu sound when you login?
2005-06-25T08:12:00.000Z	simone	HappyFool	...yes
2005-06-25T08:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	i have normal xine, not totem-xine, but i can try to help
2005-06-25T08:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	is there a 'settings' menu, or maybe 'Edit -> Preferences', something like that ?
2005-06-25T08:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	yes
2005-06-25T08:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	well, totem-xine
2005-06-25T08:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	hmm
2005-06-25T08:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	sorry, i don't have totem-xine, and it looks like installing it will remove totem-gstreamer, and i don't want to do that
2005-06-25T08:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	let me see in plain xine can play avis -- one moment
2005-06-25T08:22:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	you need to use backports for those, i think
2005-06-25T08:22:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats should tell you how
2005-06-25T08:23:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	heh. it's a web address
2005-06-25T08:25:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	hmm, sorry, that page doesn't mention w32codecs
2005-06-25T08:25:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	try ubuntuguide.org
2005-06-25T08:27:00.000Z	simone	HappyFool	and Threaputic: Thank you I will do some reading, and hopefully I don't have to come back to bother your.
2005-07-06T13:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	cmatheson: you need to 'sudo chown -R weiers /home/weiers'
2005-07-06T14:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	these problems are most likely because of residual mandrake gnome cruft in your /home/weiers directory
2005-07-06T14:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	reinstalling might be easiest; you could also try erasing (or renaming) directories and files like ~/.gnome2, ~/.gconf, ~/.gconfd etc.
2005-07-06T14:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	simone	this would be from a text-mode console, after you've logged out
