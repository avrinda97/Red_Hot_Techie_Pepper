2008-12-26T16:14:00.000Z	Gnea	worldcitizen09	at the boot screen, press F6 and delete the following words from the sequence: quiet splash
2008-12-26T16:16:00.000Z	Gnea	worldcitizen09	you need to read what it says and decide from there.
2008-12-26T16:29:00.000Z	Gnea	worldcitizen09	it sounds like you have a bad video driver
2008-12-26T16:30:00.000Z	Gnea	worldcitizen09	what video card do you have?
2008-12-26T16:30:00.000Z	worldcitizen09	Gnea	I downloaded the Linux mint and the same problem came up. they boot fine in safe graphics mode but then i cannot change resolution later
2008-12-26T16:31:00.000Z	Gnea	worldcitizen09	then you have a hardware problem.
2008-12-26T16:32:00.000Z	worldcitizen09	Gnea	the display driver in windows is  VIA/S3G UniChrome Pro IGP. It works fine in Linux with ubuntu 8.04 or linux mint 5 but not with 8.10 etc
2008-12-26T16:33:00.000Z	Gnea	worldcitizen09	i see. you can try changing the display driver from S3 to VESA when it boots to safe graphics mode
2008-12-26T16:34:00.000Z	worldcitizen09	Gnea	can u give me a bit of guidance on that
2008-12-26T16:35:00.000Z	Gnea	worldcitizen09	when ubuntu starts, does it give you the option of booting into single-user mode?
2008-12-26T16:36:00.000Z	worldcitizen09	Gnea	perhaps so, I can check later when i boot in there. I know i have to fill in user name and password
2008-12-26T16:37:00.000Z	Gnea	worldcitizen09	sounds good. you may also want to read and bookmark this page: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=342115
2008-12-26T16:45:00.000Z	worldcitizen09	Gnea	I looked at the page. Thanks a lot. My mother board is Gigabyte K8M800 which is mentioned there. however I dont understand the change of settings. Can u please help with xorg etc
2008-12-26T16:45:00.000Z	Gnea	worldcitizen09	once you are able to boot the system into single-user mode, you will be able to change the /etc/X11/xorg.conf then
2008-12-26T16:48:00.000Z	worldcitizen09	Gnea	is there a motherboard for amd platform that will install ubuntu as a breeze or should i switch over to intel
2008-12-26T16:49:00.000Z	worldcitizen09	Gnea	I am thinking of upgrading to amd 5000+ or intel dual core
2008-12-26T16:49:00.000Z	Gnea	worldcitizen09	I really am not sure what is a good motherboard that's new these days
2008-12-26T16:50:00.000Z	Gnea	worldcitizen09	you should stick with AMD
2008-12-26T16:51:00.000Z	Gnea	worldcitizen09	Tyan and Asus are preferable.
2008-12-26T16:52:00.000Z	Gnea	worldcitizen09	we'll be here :)
