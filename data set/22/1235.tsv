2010-11-10T15:30:00.000Z	MikeH		Morning (or evening) guys.
2010-11-10T15:30:00.000Z	MikeH		Having troubles
2010-11-10T15:31:00.000Z	MikeH		I've set some files to g+w (-rw-rw-r--) chgrp them to 'mygroup', but owner is mike. I've added another user 'bob' added him to ehd group, but he still does not have permission to write to these files?
2010-11-10T15:32:00.000Z	wechat	MikeH	chgrp, chmod
2010-11-10T15:32:00.000Z	MikeH	wechat	yes, I've chgrp -R ehd . and then chmod -R g+w .
2010-11-10T15:34:00.000Z	wechat	MikeH	usermod
2010-11-10T15:35:00.000Z	MikeH	wechat	usermod -a -G mygroup bob
2010-11-10T15:36:00.000Z	wechat	MikeH	: gconf-editor > apps > nautilus > set advanced permission > you will see everything in rwx-style
2010-11-10T15:37:00.000Z	MikeH	wechat	I do not have X installed.
2010-11-10T15:38:00.000Z	wechat	MikeH	true-lish
2010-11-10T15:38:00.000Z	MikeH	wechat	'-rw-rw-r--' suggests that group permissions are working ok, anyway?
2010-11-10T15:39:00.000Z	wechat	MikeH	: files or folders? without x you can't open folders then try rwX
2010-11-10T15:39:00.000Z	MikeH	wechat	files
2010-11-10T15:41:00.000Z	MikeH	wechat	lrwxrwxrwx  1 mike mike   21 2010-11-10 10:22 tomato -> /home/mike/dev/tomato
2010-11-10T15:44:00.000Z	wechat	MikeH	: links doesn't follow the rights probably
2010-11-10T15:44:00.000Z	wechat	MikeH	what are the rights for tomato?
2010-11-10T15:47:00.000Z	MikeH	wechat	lestat : lol `newgrp` didn't do it.
2010-11-10T15:47:00.000Z	wechat	MikeH	there are differnet groups -- try everything from the beginning
2010-11-10T15:50:00.000Z	MikeH	wechat	is there another way?
2010-11-10T15:50:00.000Z	MikeH	wechat	I don't want files another user creates being inaccessible?
2010-11-10T15:51:00.000Z	wechat	MikeH	chmod 700 file
2010-11-10T15:52:00.000Z	MikeH	wechat	I think you misunderstand. I'm worried about not being able to access new files
