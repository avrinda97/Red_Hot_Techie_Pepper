2007-09-23T16:19:00.000Z	Crozar		i need help run'ing virtual box please.
2007-09-23T13:00:00.000Z	Crozar		can some1 help me with VirtualBox? i have downloaded and installed it but on procedure #2 after putting the source theyr is something about a key and how can u do that
2007-09-23T13:01:00.000Z	PriceChild	Crozar	something about a key? Could you be more exact... especially as this software isn't in ubuntu its gonna be harder for us to help if you don't give us any information
2007-09-23T13:03:00.000Z	Crozar	PriceChild	well after installing  i have added the sources.list with a code givin in virtualbox . site , then it asks me about the innotek public key for apt-secure i downloaded that it says u can add the key with apt-key add innotek i did but gives me an eror
2007-09-23T13:04:00.000Z	PriceChild	Crozar	right :) Ok you can ignore these warnings if you want, they are not critical... or you can search for innotek's gpg key to add in system > admin > software sources
2007-09-23T13:05:00.000Z	Crozar	PriceChild	 but i cant see the app to launch virtual box :/
2007-09-23T13:05:00.000Z	PriceChild	Crozar	is it installed?
2007-09-23T13:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	Crozar	after adding the line to your sources.list then you need to apt-get install the package?
2007-09-23T13:08:00.000Z	PriceChild	Crozar	yuo didn't tell me the first bit... if you've isntalled it from a deb, no need to add the line to sources.list
2007-09-23T13:08:00.000Z	PriceChild	Crozar	I "think" it is located in "applications > other" or "applications > system tools"
2007-09-23T13:08:00.000Z	Crozar	PriceChild	 i did the exact procedure from this site look http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
2007-09-23T13:09:00.000Z	PriceChild	Crozar	wget http://www.virtualbox.org/debian/innotek.asc
2007-09-23T13:09:00.000Z	PriceChild	Crozar	apt-key add innotek.asc

2007-11-21T02:57:00.000Z	PriceChild	Crozar	give details of what you're trying to do... what you're tried, and what isn't working, including errors etc.
2007-11-21T02:58:00.000Z	PriceChild	Crozar	I've never used a tablet, but if you do the 3 things i said earlier (you've achieved 1) someone might be able to help
