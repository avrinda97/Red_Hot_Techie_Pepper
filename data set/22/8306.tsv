2006-04-30T12:23:00.000Z	holycow	Flannel	indeed
2006-04-30T12:20:00.000Z	Flannel	holycow	actually, it's right in the center of each eye, where the optical nerve leaves.
2006-04-30T12:22:00.000Z	Flannel	holycow	who cares what he says, he's acting immature regarding bugs, not worth my time.
2006-04-30T12:29:00.000Z	holycow	Flannel	i bet his password is something like 'flannel' or 'password'
2006-05-27T13:26:00.000Z	Flannel	holycow	eh, desktop polish isn't nearly as important as the userbase (that helps, instead of 'RTFM's)
2006-05-27T13:26:00.000Z	holycow	Flannel	well i'm a cranky bastard, it is appreciated in hindsight that you guys do keep it nice and friendly in here on purpose
2006-05-27T13:27:00.000Z	Flannel	holycow	not only that, but it only gets better, because as we're helpful, people stay.  First as lurkers for more information, then they start dishing out factoids, etc.  Its a vicious cycle.
2006-05-27T13:28:00.000Z	holycow	Flannel	indeed, i never expected that at all actually
2006-09-04T14:18:00.000Z	holycow	Flannel	congratulations on killing the conversation
2006-09-04T14:19:00.000Z	Flannel	holycow	shrug, its what usually happens when you ask people to go to -offtopic, not that anyone who suggests it is trying to kill it.
2006-09-04T14:19:00.000Z	holycow	Flannel	i'm kidden, indeed
2006-12-23T15:46:00.000Z	Flannel	holycow	yes, it does.  You want the "mini" ISO: help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2006-12-23T15:47:00.000Z	holycow	Flannel	oh really
2006-12-23T16:05:00.000Z	holycow	Flannel	interesting i didn't know about that channel
2006-12-27T16:12:00.000Z	Flannel	holycow	no it doesn't.
2006-12-27T16:13:00.000Z	Flannel	holycow	ubuntu does not freeze off of unstable every six months
2006-12-27T16:14:00.000Z	holycow	Flannel	dude please.  stop saying dumb things.
2006-12-27T16:14:00.000Z	Flannel	holycow	stop being wrong.
2006-12-27T16:15:00.000Z	holycow	Flannel	stop messeging me.  ubuntu freezes off of debian unstable.  if you didn't know that i'm terribly sorry.
2008-08-17T12:09:00.000Z	Flannel	holycow	#ubuntu-offtopic would be a better place to mention that
2008-08-17T12:11:00.000Z	holycow	Flannel	i distinctly remember not asking you for permission
2008-08-17T12:11:00.000Z	Flannel	holycow	Please keep it on topic, general discussion isn't on topic.
