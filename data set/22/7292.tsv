2006-05-01T14:58:00.000Z	Quan-Time		hey. me and a friend have a fair bit of experience with linux.. but currently we both use winxp.. we are sick to death of the problems we get.. i have a nvidia triple monitor display. TV / LCD off a 7800gtx and a CRT on a 6200 (also PCIe). he has a ATI and dual monitor.. how much grief are we gonna encounter by installing and trying to get multi monitors working ?
2006-05-01T14:59:00.000Z	DBO	Quan-Time	you wont have much, he will have more
2006-05-01T15:00:00.000Z	Quan-Time	DBO	excellent.. thats what i like to hear. i used mdk10.1 for about 6 months with ati.. and hated every min of it (about a year ago).. and since now i have nvidia again.. thought id do the big switch...
2006-05-01T15:01:00.000Z	DBO	Quan-Time	Im not sure about that third output, probably going to have a bit of trouble with that triple monitor deal, but I didnt think the 7800GTX could do dual AND tv at the same time (I have one myself)...
2006-05-01T15:02:00.000Z	Quan-Time	DBO	its a nvidia thing.. you have 3 outputs.. 2 DVI (or dvi and dsub) and TV.. you can only use 2 at the same time
2006-05-01T15:03:00.000Z	DBO	Quan-Time	that is what I thought
2006-05-01T15:04:00.000Z	DBO	Quan-Time	Im not saying it cant be done, but I dont think it can be done with one card all being run at the same time.  At any rate I wouldnt know where to start with the tv, but the two monitors will essentially work out of the box with the nvidia drivers
2006-05-01T15:06:00.000Z	Quan-Time	DBO	xconfig86 can do it... tv-out shouldnt be an issue. ive done it before.. just have to specify res / hz..
2006-05-01T15:06:00.000Z	DBO	Quan-Time	cool, do a writeup of what you do step for step, I may end up using it =)
2006-05-01T15:07:00.000Z	Quan-Time	DBO	HARHRAH.. fair enough.. i just dont know about 2 video cards is all.. thats basically my issue.. but since they are both nvidia core. i cant see too much of an issue. if i pull it off, ill explain how i do it later :)
2006-05-01T15:09:00.000Z	DBO	Quan-Time	people still own dreamcasts? =P
2006-05-01T15:10:00.000Z	Quan-Time	DBO	dreamcast also has the VGA output attachment.. so i can tak it to LANs and things with mates, and play on LCDs.. works sweet
2006-05-01T15:11:00.000Z	DBO	Quan-Time	me, and guillem101, I hate to say it, but we have wondered offtopic, we need to take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
2006-05-01T15:28:00.000Z	DBO	Quan-Time	it should work fine, but ubuntu has something of a bad habit of "seeing through" hardware RAID...
2006-05-01T15:28:00.000Z	Quan-Time	DBO	explain this "seeing thru" thing.. meaning, it wont work with raid ?
2006-05-01T15:29:00.000Z	DBO	Quan-Time	in some rare cases, despite hardware RAID being set up, ubuntu will still detect both hard drives individually
2006-05-01T15:32:00.000Z	DBO	Quan-Time	you need to take this conversation to #ubuntu-offtopic ... sorry
2006-05-01T15:33:00.000Z	Quan-Time	DBO	10-4
2006-05-05T11:20:00.000Z	DBO	Quan-Time	with different images?
2006-05-05T11:20:00.000Z	Quan-Time	DBO	mouse slides across all 3
2006-05-05T11:20:00.000Z	DBO	Quan-Time	niiiiice =)
2006-05-05T11:20:00.000Z	Quan-Time	DBO	yer.. ive had linux for about 2hrs now... so ive done well ;)
