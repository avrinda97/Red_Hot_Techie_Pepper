2008-11-01T06:18:00.000Z	blak		Everytime I use gnome network manager and I use an encrypted wireless network it asks for a keychain password... i don't know where or h ow to set this up... If i don't use this i have to put in the wifi key every time i restart the computer. What is going on with this after 8.10 update?
2008-11-01T06:19:00.000Z	n8tuser	blak	put it in the interfaces file,  man interfaces please
2008-11-01T06:19:00.000Z	n8tuser		Malgra-> you have to tell me about your wifi nic card
2008-11-01T06:20:00.000Z	n8tuser		Malgra->   man interfaces   to get an idea of what should be on that file
2008-11-01T06:21:00.000Z	blak	n8tuser	this does not address the keyring/keychain issue
2008-11-01T06:21:00.000Z	n8tuser		Malgra-> if you are using dhcp for it, it would a simple line of   iface wlan0 inet dhcp
2008-11-01T06:21:00.000Z	n8tuser		blak-> try it first, put your wpa2 keys on that file
2008-11-01T06:23:00.000Z	blak	n8tuser	What is the point of this new keychain thing and using network manager in gnome then? You are basically suggesting to not even use them?
2008-11-01T06:24:00.000Z	n8tuser		blak-> that keychain is required for access to network interfaces
2008-11-01T06:24:00.000Z	blak	n8tuser	it suggest i have set a keychain password, i never was given the option, how do i set my keychain password?
2008-11-01T06:24:00.000Z	n8tuser		blak-> what i said is try to put your wpa/wpa2 key in the interfaces file, and see if it still requires you to fool around with keyring stuff
2008-11-01T06:25:00.000Z	n8tuser	blak	oh i am not aware you have not setup your keyring password, it is usually the root password..
2008-11-01T06:25:00.000Z	blak	n8tuser	alright i understand that, i think it would be better to utilize this "new" keyring thing though so it is not just sitting in my interfaces  file you know?
2008-11-01T06:25:00.000Z	blak	n8tuser	how do you set it?
2008-11-01T06:26:00.000Z	n8tuser	blak	what sits on your interfaces file is the wpa2 key not the root password
2008-11-01T06:26:00.000Z	n8tuser	blak	its been a while, but lets see.. what happens when you do a sudo -i
2008-11-01T06:26:00.000Z	blak	n8tuser	of course, yes the root pass would make sense for the keyring password but it isnt that i guess... it asked to set it once and i thought i did but it obvviously isnt that password either... i never noticed keyring anything until after update to intrepid
2008-11-01T06:27:00.000Z	blak	n8tuser	switches to root
2008-11-01T06:27:00.000Z	n8tuser	blak	why did you even upgraded to ibex?
2008-11-01T06:27:00.000Z	blak	n8tuser	why not?
2008-11-01T06:27:00.000Z	n8tuser	blak	then once it switches, type  passwd
2008-11-01T06:27:00.000Z	n8tuser	blak	is there a necessity to upgrade?
