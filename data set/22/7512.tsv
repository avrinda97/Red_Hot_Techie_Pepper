2009-03-02T23:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	Incarus	the thing is it's setup to give Mac users access to a MS online system.. any guidance on how to go about this would be great.
2009-03-02T23:11:00.000Z	Incarus		<Scunizi>, do you want to connect ubuntu and ms?
2009-03-02T23:12:00.000Z	Incarus		<Scunizi>, over citrix?
2009-03-02T23:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	Incarus	I'd like to connect Ubuntu to this online site that's utilizing citrix for Mac Access.
2009-03-02T23:13:00.000Z	Incarus		<Scunizi>, Ubuntu -> Mac -> MS
2009-03-02T23:13:00.000Z	Incarus		<Scunizi>, do you want to access ms or mac?
2009-03-02T23:14:00.000Z	Incarus		<Scunizi>, hm, you want to connect the citrix server
2009-03-02T23:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	Incarus	well... sort of I guess.. the site is ties specifically to IE6+ and the folks that manage the system have finally realized that MS is not the only game in town and have set up citrix access for macs..

2009-03-02T23:15:00.000Z	Scunizi	Incarus	If I can utilize the Mac portal on citrix via Ubuntu it would simplify my life tremendously.
