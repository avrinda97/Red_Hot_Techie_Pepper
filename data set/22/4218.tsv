2008-02-17T17:59:00.000Z	peppers		hi there
2008-02-17T18:00:00.000Z	peppers		I was wondering, is there a command or commands that allows you to check the current doenstream and upstream?
2008-02-17T18:00:00.000Z	peppers		yes
2008-02-17T18:01:00.000Z	peppers		upstream and downstream in b/s or KiB/s
2008-02-17T18:01:00.000Z	peppers		there ain't a ubuntu 6.04
2008-02-17T18:02:00.000Z	peppers		there's 6.06 which is the LTS
2008-02-17T18:02:00.000Z	peppers		so ye, that one is still suported until 2009 I think
2008-02-17T18:02:00.000Z	peppers		ty Starnestommy didn't know :P
2008-02-17T18:02:00.000Z	artti	peppers	so i upgrade then to 6.06 LTS
2008-02-17T18:03:00.000Z	peppers	artti	you'd be better upgrading to 7.10 (current) or waiting for 8.04 and just using that
2008-02-17T18:03:00.000Z	artti	peppers	I have 5.10, can't directly to 7.10
2008-02-17T18:04:00.000Z	peppers	artti	then you need to go 6.06 --> 6.10 --> 7.04 --> 7.10
2008-02-17T18:05:00.000Z	artti	peppers	i'm currentlu doing that
2008-02-17T18:06:00.000Z	artti	peppers	can't do fresh install 7.10.
2008-02-17T18:06:00.000Z	artti	peppers	havent' install cd, can't burn cd
2008-02-17T18:07:00.000Z	artti	peppers	so step by step is faster and less headache
2008-02-17T18:08:00.000Z	peppers	artti	all you'll have to do is open the update manager. it'll tell you there's a new ubuntu version avaliable and you select upgrade and it does it all on its own.
2008-02-17T18:09:00.000Z	artti	peppers	synaptic?
2008-02-17T18:10:00.000Z	peppers	artti	I think so. not sure, I use kde
2008-02-17T18:11:00.000Z	artti	peppers	i've looked that page. But i can't see option to upgrade from 5.10 to 7.10
2008-02-17T18:12:00.000Z	peppers	artti	you'll have to upgrade 5.10 to 6.06 then 6.06 to 6.10 etc etc
2008-02-17T18:12:00.000Z	artti	peppers	that i'm currently doing.
