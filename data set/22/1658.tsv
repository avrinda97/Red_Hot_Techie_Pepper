2010-02-26T19:34:00.000Z	alfatau		hello, i installed a command line debian 9.10 desktop. now i would want to connect with my external 56k dialup modem, but i'm always getting the error pppd "Remote message: Autentication failed" even if i used the same user/passwd i'm using now to connect here. what can i do? thank you for your attention
2010-02-26T19:35:00.000Z	rifter	alfatau	doyou hear the modem connecting at least?
2010-02-26T19:36:00.000Z	alfatau	rifter	yes, the preceeding message was "Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/ttyS1"
2010-02-26T19:37:00.000Z	alfatau	rifter	if it can be useful...
2010-02-26T19:40:00.000Z	rifter	alfatau	well it's been awhile since I dealt with ppp but I am thinking about an authentication method issue. you say you are connecting now with the same name and password.. under what os?
2010-02-26T19:41:00.000Z	alfatau	rifter	now windows xp
2010-02-26T19:42:00.000Z	alfatau	rifter	i noticed looking at /var/log/syslog there's a message saying "PAP Autentication failed"... while i choosed CHAP from pppconfig...
2010-02-26T19:43:00.000Z	rifter	alfatau	yeah that's what I am thinking of
2010-02-26T19:43:00.000Z	rifter	alfatau	some isps used mschap
2010-02-26T19:43:00.000Z	rifter	alfatau	which is a windows-only extension of chap
2010-02-26T19:43:00.000Z	rifter	alfatau	but I think there is a solution let me see
2010-02-26T19:44:00.000Z	alfatau	rifter	well, is there a way to use CHAP? i choosed CHAP in pppconfig... while pppd still tries connecting using PAP?
2010-02-26T19:45:00.000Z	rifter	alfatau	you have t o use what the isp is using
2010-02-26T19:45:00.000Z	rifter	alfatau	I am looking at the methods for getting mschap on there
2010-02-26T19:46:00.000Z	rifter	alfatau	although.. maybe you should see what happens when you choose pap since it's saying pap authentication failed
2010-02-26T19:46:00.000Z	alfatau	rifter	thank you. i'm looking what method my isp wants we use...
2010-02-26T19:47:00.000Z	alfatau	rifter	so i should chooose pap instead of chap?
2010-02-26T19:48:00.000Z	rifter	alfatau	you should try it and see, meanwhile I am looking into how to get the mschap modules on so you can use that in case the answer is to use mschap
2010-02-26T19:49:00.000Z	rifter		actually you don't want to write to /dev/null like that
2010-02-26T19:50:00.000Z	alfatau	rifter	ok
2010-02-26T19:50:00.000Z	alfatau	rifter	i need to disconnect. i'll come back in a while (i hope with ubuntu box), thank you a lot
2010-02-26T19:51:00.000Z	rifter	alfatau	ok see you soon
