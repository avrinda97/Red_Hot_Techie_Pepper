2005-08-31T16:07:00.000Z	maz		thanks peeps - just tried 'play' and the command wasn't found
2005-08-31T16:09:00.000Z	maz		so does this mean xmms is inherently unable to play wmv files?
2005-08-31T16:09:00.000Z	maz		yes Ng, I installed w32codecs

2005-08-31T16:10:00.000Z	maz		extremely happy with ubuntu - it spanks my old Win98 and red hat 9
2005-08-31T16:10:00.000Z	maz		can even do video editing... never worked that out on red had nine
2005-08-31T16:10:00.000Z	maz		that's possible Ng - see what Tom_W just wrote too

2005-08-31T16:18:00.000Z	clem_yeats	maz	there's nothing much in Canberra is there ?
2005-08-31T16:18:00.000Z	clem_yeats	maz	: I like the kind of cemetery in Canberra.. with the fake people standing up... I though that was really cool.
2005-08-31T16:20:00.000Z	clem_yeats	maz	: well.. it was interesting.. I staid there for two days.

2005-08-31T16:45:00.000Z	clem_yeats	maz	what kind of channel are you looking for ?
2005-08-31T16:47:00.000Z	clem_yeats	maz	: the freenode network is full of geeks and most of its channels are computer related..
2005-08-31T16:48:00.000Z	clem_yeats	maz	: to chat about "life" outside the computer room try quakenet, dalnet, efnet, ircnet etc etc
2005-08-31T16:48:00.000Z	clem_yeats	maz	: these are IRC networks, not channels.
