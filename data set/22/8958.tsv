2005-07-12T08:50:00.000Z	bddebian	steven_	Well it isn't better than sex if that is what you mean ;-)
2005-07-12T08:52:00.000Z	bddebian	steven_	So get installing! ;-)
2005-07-12T08:56:00.000Z	bddebian	steven_	Find out about what?
2005-07-12T08:57:00.000Z	bddebian	steven_	Should be able to, though you might need w32codecs or some such
2005-07-12T08:57:00.000Z	bddebian	steven_	Of course :-)
2005-07-12T08:58:00.000Z	bddebian	steven_	So use synaptic or aptitude
2005-07-12T08:59:00.000Z	bddebian	steven_	apt is a front-end for dpkg to install packages
2005-07-12T09:02:00.000Z	bddebian	steven_	That would be kubuntu
2005-07-12T10:03:00.000Z	bddebian	steven_	Congrats.  Welcome to the fold. :-)
2005-07-12T10:06:00.000Z	bddebian	steven_	Aye, or use apt-get
2005-07-12T10:07:00.000Z	bddebian	steven_	kubuntu
2005-07-12T10:10:00.000Z	bddebian	steven_	xpde? ;-P
