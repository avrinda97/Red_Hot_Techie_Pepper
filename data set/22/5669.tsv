2007-03-29T09:16:00.000Z	sharkp		Does Feisty directly read NTFS partitions?
2007-03-29T09:16:00.000Z	sharkp		Will Feisty directly read NTFS partitions?
2007-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	SeveredCross	sharkp	Read, yes, write no.
2007-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	sharkp	SeveredCross	thanx
2007-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	SeveredCross		To write, you need fuse/ntfs-3g.
2007-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	sharkp	SeveredCross	I need to work with a liveCd on a NTFS partition
2007-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	sharkp		how can I do?
2007-03-29T09:18:00.000Z	SeveredCross	sharkp	The LiveCD will read NTFS partitions, you just have to mount them.
2007-03-29T09:18:00.000Z	SeveredCross		First, you might need sudo mkdir /mnt/ntfs
2007-03-29T09:18:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Then
2007-03-29T09:18:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Try sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hdax /mnt/ntfs
2007-03-29T09:18:00.000Z	sharkp		oh, so my problem is solved? After mounting the partition, Can I write on it?
2007-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	SeveredCross	sharkp	You cannot write on it with the standard NTFS driver, you need to install fuse/ntfs-3g.
2007-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	SeveredCross		!fuse | sharkp
2007-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	SeveredCross		^^
2007-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	sharkp		So, I must install fuse...But Can I use it with a liveCD?
2007-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Yes.
2007-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	SeveredCross		You can install things on a LiveCD, using sudo apt-get
2007-03-29T09:20:00.000Z	sharkp	SeveredCross	thanx
2007-03-29T09:20:00.000Z	SeveredCross		They'll be installed with your system if you decide to install it to hard drive.
2007-03-29T09:20:00.000Z	sharkp	SeveredCross	yes, but without installing anybody,can I use it?
