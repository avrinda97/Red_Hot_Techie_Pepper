2011-02-09T12:48:00.000Z	ubuntuliveuser		I believe that is done in the BIOS
2011-02-09T12:50:00.000Z	ubuntuliveuser		Okay.  But I do remember it being an option in the BIOS on all my machines.
2011-02-09T12:51:00.000Z	ubuntuliveuser		There is usually a jumper on the motherboard to reset the bios password
2011-02-09T12:52:00.000Z	ubuntuliveuser		Who knows how to restore Grub2 when it nothing ever works?
2011-02-09T12:52:00.000Z	ubuntuliveuser		Noone on any channel can answer.
2011-02-09T12:53:00.000Z	ubuntuliveuser		NOTHING works and I am tired of getting that web address no offense.
2011-02-09T12:55:00.000Z	ubuntuliveuser		Too many times.
2011-02-09T12:55:00.000Z	ubuntuliveuser		As well as too many other Grub websites.
2011-02-09T12:55:00.000Z	ubuntuliveuser		Absolutely everything ends the same: FAIL!
2011-02-09T12:56:00.000Z	ubuntuliveuser		Any way to do upgrade and save all the files/programs already installed?
2011-02-09T12:56:00.000Z	nit-wit	ubuntuliveuser	download a supergrub ISO boot it into the ubuntu and reload the mbr from there.
2011-02-09T12:59:00.000Z	nit-wit	ubuntuliveuser	http://www.supergrubdisk.org/
2011-02-09T13:07:00.000Z	nit-wit	ubuntuliveuser	if you can run this script and pastebin it we could probably get to an answer.http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/
2011-02-09T13:08:00.000Z	nit-wit	ubuntuliveuser	if you do this use the tab complete on my nick so I am notified you posted the pastebin.
2011-02-09T13:11:00.000Z	nit-wit	ubuntuliveuser	are you talking to me
2011-02-09T13:12:00.000Z	nit-wit	ubuntuliveuser	are you on the live ubuntu cd
2011-02-09T13:13:00.000Z	nit-wit	ubuntuliveuser	you will have to elaborate on not getting the script to run.
2011-02-09T13:15:00.000Z	ubuntuliveuser	nit-wit	http://pastebin.com/pKKU9gFB
2011-02-09T13:17:00.000Z	nit-wit	ubuntuliveuser	you have grub in this line Boot files/dirs:   /boot.ini /ntldr /NTDETECT.COM /boot/grub/core.img
2011-02-09T13:17:00.000Z	nit-wit	ubuntuliveuser	that is the XP C
2011-02-09T13:19:00.000Z	nit-wit	ubuntuliveuser	theoretically it should be doing the opposite, if the sdb drive is being read first have you checked
2011-02-09T13:20:00.000Z	nit-wit	ubuntuliveuser	if you don't tab finish itis hard to tell who your answering
