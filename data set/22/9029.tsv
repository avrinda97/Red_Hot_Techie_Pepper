2005-06-05T12:01:00.000Z	bob2	pinPoint	do you know about SNMP in general?
2005-06-05T12:01:00.000Z	bob2	pinPoint	also, do you care if you use mrtg, or are you just trying to get pretty bandwidth graphs?

2005-06-05T12:02:00.000Z	pinPoint	bob2	i want it to draw those graphs for me

2005-06-05T12:03:00.000Z	pinPoint	bob2	:: env LANG=C /usr/bin/mrtg
2005-06-05T12:06:00.000Z	pinPoint	bob2	did you have anything in mind...
2005-06-05T12:07:00.000Z	bob2	pinPoint	I was going to suggest rrdtool, which has much better docs
2005-06-05T12:07:00.000Z	pinPoint	bob2	is it dependable?
2005-06-05T12:07:00.000Z	bob2	pinPoint	yes
2005-06-05T12:07:00.000Z	bob2	pinPoint	of course
2005-06-05T12:08:00.000Z	bob2	pinPoint	it's the successor to mrtg, more or less
2005-06-05T12:08:00.000Z	pinPoint	bob2	cacti better?
2005-06-05T12:09:00.000Z	bob2	pinPoint	I think cacti works on top of rrdtool
