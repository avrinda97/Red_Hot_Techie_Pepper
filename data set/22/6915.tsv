2006-07-21T14:33:00.000Z	azureal	mwe	is that what i'm looking for?
2006-08-09T05:05:00.000Z	azureal	mwe	i think you tried to answer my question about fonts, but wrote 'ravenous' ... so I tried copying the .pcf.gz into /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc, mkfontdir .  ,but then xlsfonts does not return it
2006-08-09T05:07:00.000Z	mwe	azureal	did you mkfontdir after cd /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc and also xset fp rehash afterwards?
2006-08-09T05:07:00.000Z	azureal	mwe	i said, nvm!! =P thx
2006-08-09T05:08:00.000Z	mwe	azureal	because it wont work if you sudo mkfontdir while $PWD is not the right dir. but ok. odd though
2006-08-09T14:11:00.000Z	azureal	mwe	were you the one who helped me that one time?
2006-08-09T14:11:00.000Z	azureal	mwe	w/ fonts? =P
2006-08-09T14:11:00.000Z	mwe	azureal	I think so yes
2006-08-09T14:14:00.000Z	azureal	mwe	they show up, so
2006-08-09T14:14:00.000Z	azureal	mwe	yea, they showed up for him in xlsfonts but
2006-08-09T14:22:00.000Z	mwe	azureal	I think it's not unicode enabled
2006-08-09T14:22:00.000Z	mwe	azureal	maybe that's it
2006-08-09T14:22:00.000Z	mwe	azureal	I switched to rxvt-unicode for the that reason
2006-08-09T14:22:00.000Z	azureal	mwe	oh, how do i fix that? (i was mainly using just xterm)
2006-08-09T14:22:00.000Z	mwe	azureal	use another terminal emulator
2006-08-09T14:30:00.000Z	mwe	azureal	really aterm is not cool with unicode
2006-08-09T14:30:00.000Z	mwe	azureal	it will print bogus
2006-08-09T14:32:00.000Z	mwe	azureal	copy paste this '' to your aterm and you'll see what I mean
2006-08-10T15:50:00.000Z	azureal	mwe	don't repeat =P
2006-08-10T15:50:00.000Z	mwe	azureal	;)
2006-08-10T15:51:00.000Z	mwe	azureal	don't repeat
