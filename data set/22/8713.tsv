2005-06-04T13:17:00.000Z	neofax		Hello everyone!
2005-06-04T13:18:00.000Z	neofax		OK, try running sudo ifconfig
2005-06-04T13:19:00.000Z	neofax		Let us know the first three octets of your IP
2005-06-04T13:19:00.000Z	neofax		Such as 192.168.0.???
2005-06-04T13:19:00.000Z	neofax		Yes, the one that cannot connect
2005-06-04T13:20:00.000Z	neofax		OK, at least we know you have a internal IP.  Did you manually set that up in UBUNTU?
2005-06-04T13:21:00.000Z	neofax		Because a normalcable does not switch the first and the eighth cable so they cannot connect
2005-06-04T13:23:00.000Z	toxicfum1	neofax	i don't see "default gateway" anywhere in the ifconfig command's results
2005-06-04T13:24:00.000Z	toxicfum1	neofax	how do i set the gateway?
2005-06-04T13:25:00.000Z	toxicfum1	neofax	okay i typed it and got a result
2005-06-04T13:26:00.000Z	toxicfum1	neofax	that's right
2005-06-04T13:28:00.000Z	toxicfum1	neofax	okay
2005-06-04T13:29:00.000Z	toxicfum1	neofax	it says destination host unreachable
2005-06-04T13:30:00.000Z	toxicfum1	neofax	prettysure it is..it was working fine when i botoed the laptop into windows..and since then i restarted into ubuntu andhaven't removed the cable
2005-06-04T13:31:00.000Z	toxicfum1	neofax	okay
2005-06-04T13:31:00.000Z	toxicfum1	neofax	then?
2005-06-04T13:32:00.000Z	toxicfum1	neofax	what name should i give next to it?
2005-06-04T13:34:00.000Z	toxicfum1	neofax	it's LAXO
2005-06-04T13:34:00.000Z	toxicfum1	neofax	okay, close the file now?
2005-06-04T13:35:00.000Z	toxicfum1	neofax	okay, it's done
2005-06-04T13:36:00.000Z	toxicfum1	neofax	it says "Connect: Network is unreachable" :(
2005-06-04T13:37:00.000Z	toxicfum1	neofax	I think it's cause i removed the cable and put it back in..do i have to restart now?
