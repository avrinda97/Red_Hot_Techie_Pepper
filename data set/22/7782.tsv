2005-12-28T13:40:00.000Z	M3G4		1GHz is still kinda fast, and it is nowhere near this slow even in memory hungry WinXP
2005-12-28T13:40:00.000Z	M3G4		192MB with 8MB shared with GFX
2005-12-28T13:41:00.000Z	M3G4		if I added more ram, would it improve speed much?
2005-12-28T13:42:00.000Z	M3G4		the system generally crawls - from window rendering to actually launching applications
2005-12-28T13:43:00.000Z	M3G4		I'll add some more RAM In the new year then
2005-12-28T13:43:00.000Z	M3G4		but until then it'll have to plod along like this. what sort of RAM would be optimal for this PC?
2005-12-28T13:43:00.000Z	M3G4		256?
2005-12-28T13:44:00.000Z	M3G4		512MB for a 1GHz machine?
2005-12-28T13:44:00.000Z	M3G4		isn't that overkill?
2005-12-28T13:44:00.000Z	M3G4		and generally slow performance :p
2005-12-28T13:44:00.000Z	pashaw	M3G4	  how much swap space is used  in "top"
2005-12-28T13:45:00.000Z	pashaw	M3G4	 open a terminal and type   top
2005-12-28T13:45:00.000Z	pashaw	M3G4	   hit Q  to stop it
2005-12-28T13:46:00.000Z	pashaw	M3G4	  im using 192mb ram laptop right now
2005-12-28T13:46:00.000Z	pashaw	M3G4	  its pokey  but  usable
2005-12-28T13:47:00.000Z	pashaw	M3G4	   the 2nd column not the first one
2005-12-28T13:48:00.000Z	pashaw	M3G4	  the first column is total   2nd column in USED
2005-12-28T13:49:00.000Z	pashaw	M3G4	  thats only 12mb swapped
2005-12-28T13:50:00.000Z	pashaw	M3G4	  mine Swap:   875532k total,    48828k used,   826704k free,    63044k cached
2005-12-28T13:50:00.000Z	pashaw	M3G4	  video driver not setup correctly in xorg.conf
2005-12-28T13:51:00.000Z	M3G4	pashaw	- it was originally set to S3 ProSavage which is what it is, then I got told to switch to VESA
2005-12-28T13:52:00.000Z	pashaw	M3G4	  haha      operator error   would be the excuse
