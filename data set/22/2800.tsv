2009-06-27T22:25:00.000Z	sillyCEO		But I don't know how to see all the things I am currently running (like the task manager of windows)

2009-06-27T22:26:00.000Z	sillyCEO		Is there one for pulling up all apps running?
2009-06-27T22:27:00.000Z	sillyCEO		I'm trying to pull up something that resembles 'task manager'- somthing to show me what's running.
2009-06-27T22:27:00.000Z	sillyCEO		not sure what 'hotkey' would do that.
2009-06-27T22:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sillyCEO	from a command line two things of interest for you 1) "top" and 2) "ps aux", have fun

2009-06-27T22:29:00.000Z	sillyCEO		OK then, I'm a dumb nooob.

2009-06-27T22:30:00.000Z	sillyCEO		Wow there are a alot of processes. I bet I could shut half of them down! The trick is knowing which!
2009-06-27T22:31:00.000Z	sillyCEO		good idea mickster04. Might just do that.
2009-06-27T22:31:00.000Z	sillyCEO		Hey, I'm trying to write a script that will launch Firefox upon startup.
2009-06-27T22:31:00.000Z	sillyCEO		BUT I need to wait a bit (so wifi can connect)
2009-06-27T22:32:00.000Z	sillyCEO		How's this:
2009-06-27T22:32:00.000Z	sillyCEO		sleep 1000
2009-06-27T22:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sillyCEO	System / Preferences / Startup Application - then ADD firefox.  Easier then a script that's for sure.
