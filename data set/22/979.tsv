2011-09-24T02:51:00.000Z	sburwood1		Is there a list of network devices (usb, pci, or pcie) that are "guaranteed" to work with Ubuntu, whether it be 32 or 64 bit
2011-09-24T02:52:00.000Z	sburwood1		like there is with Sane for the scanners
2011-09-24T02:52:00.000Z	MeanEYE	sburwood1	Ubuntu has a list of certified hardware. Most of drivers are in kernel so I hope they have a list too. :D
2011-09-24T02:53:00.000Z	sburwood1	MeanEYE	I ask that question because I haven't yet found something to help me with the installation of a USB Wifi key from D-link
2011-09-24T02:53:00.000Z	MeanEYE	sburwood1	Does `lsusb` command list it?
2011-09-24T02:55:00.000Z	MeanEYE	sburwood1	And what `ifconfig -a` shows?
2011-09-24T03:01:00.000Z	sburwood1	MeanEYE	I did ifconfig without prefacing with sudo.  It came back with no reference to the Wifi key I have
2011-09-24T03:02:00.000Z	sburwood1	MeanEYE	Which thing is the most interesting to look at, eth0, lo, or vboxnet 0?
2011-09-24T03:03:00.000Z	MeanEYE	sburwood1	eth0 is you ethernet, vboxnet is virtual nat for vbox
2011-09-24T03:04:00.000Z	MeanEYE	sburwood1	lo = loopback
2011-09-24T03:05:00.000Z	sburwood1	MeanEYE	When I did  do lsusb, it came back with Bus 002 Device 004: ID 2001:3c17 D-Link Corp.
2011-09-24T03:06:00.000Z	MeanEYE	sburwood1	can you give me the exact model?
2011-09-24T03:06:00.000Z	sburwood1	MeanEYE	As far as I can tell (nothing is written on the key), it is a DWA-135
2011-09-24T03:07:00.000Z	MeanEYE	sburwood1	Oh, that one... Did you try playing with ndiswrapper?
2011-09-24T03:08:00.000Z	sburwood1	MeanEYE	I know that it exists, but playing around with that, I haven't yet done
2011-09-24T03:09:00.000Z	MeanEYE	sburwood1	I think that's the only way. I could be wrong but installing windows drivers for such poorly supported devices is th eonly way if you ask me.
2011-09-24T03:10:00.000Z	sburwood1	MeanEYE	can you give me a crash course in playing with ndiswrapper?
2011-09-24T03:10:00.000Z	MeanEYE	sburwood1	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
2011-09-24T03:10:00.000Z	sburwood1	MeanEYE	Can't hurt
2011-09-24T03:11:00.000Z	MeanEYE	sburwood1	Well, ask someone else to confirm that I gave you the right link. Am not sure. Haven't played with ndis for some time now. ndisgtk comes preinstalled on Mint so I never had any problems with the installation itself but I never used windows drivers. Looks simple and easy to use.
2011-09-24T03:12:00.000Z	sburwood1	MeanEYE	I am hesitant whenever someone tells me that something is easy
2011-09-24T03:13:00.000Z	MeanEYE	sburwood1	I said it looks easy to use :D ... I can make it complicated for you if you wish :D
