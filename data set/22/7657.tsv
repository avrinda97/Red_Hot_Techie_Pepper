2006-06-05T06:44:00.000Z	grap		can anyone help? im in nvidia trouble
2006-06-05T06:45:00.000Z	ynef	grap	what does the log file tell you? what error messages do you get?
2006-06-05T06:47:00.000Z	grap	ynef	jhunter good luxk!
2006-06-05T06:48:00.000Z	grap	ynef	basically it said that the version did not match
2006-06-05T06:50:00.000Z	grap	ynef	can you help?
2006-06-05T06:51:00.000Z	ynef	grap	not unless I see the errors X told you -- they are more specific than you think :)
2006-06-05T06:51:00.000Z	grap	ynef	i cant find it, because it now works fine, but when i will reboot it will fail again
2006-06-05T06:52:00.000Z	ynef	grap	how annoying -- what did you do to fix it this time?
2006-06-05T06:52:00.000Z	grap	ynef	i found it!
2006-06-05T06:53:00.000Z	ynef	grap	the lines before that?
2006-06-05T06:53:00.000Z	ynef	grap	and have you consulted the NVIDIA README file? ;)
2006-06-05T06:53:00.000Z	grap	ynef	i guess there is a simple solution
2006-06-05T06:55:00.000Z	ynef	grap	tell me exactly what you did, step by step
2006-06-05T06:55:00.000Z	ynef	grap	(and preface every line with "ynef", so I get it highlighted -- please!) :)
2006-06-05T06:56:00.000Z	grap	ynef	firstly i installed the propietary nvidia driver and it failed because of my xorg.conf so i decided to install the ones from ubuntu repositories
2006-06-05T06:57:00.000Z	ynef	grap	right. so doesn't the proprietary drivers have some kind of "uninstall" feature?
2006-06-05T06:57:00.000Z	grap	ynef	that's all, the only thing i have to do now, everytime when i reboot, is to reinstall the propietary drivers and it works
2006-06-05T06:57:00.000Z	grap	ynef	i guess so, i'll look for it
2006-06-05T06:59:00.000Z	grap	ynef	done, lets try it again, rebooting!
2006-06-05T07:00:00.000Z	ynef	grap	great -- good luck :)
2006-06-05T07:09:00.000Z	grap	ynef	it worked!
2006-06-05T07:10:00.000Z	ynef	grap	nice! congratulations, man! :)
