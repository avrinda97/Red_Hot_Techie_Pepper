2007-08-10T05:30:00.000Z	LiberCogito	Chousuke	it still has its bugs.
2007-08-10T05:30:00.000Z	Chousuke	LiberCogito	It does, but it'll refuse operations that would not succeed.
2007-08-10T05:31:00.000Z	Chousuke	LiberCogito	so it won't break NTFS partitions
2007-08-10T05:32:00.000Z	LiberCogito	Chousuke	Read that back to yourself and tell me you honestly think it makes sense.
2007-08-10T05:32:00.000Z	Chousuke	LiberCogito	sean: there are some cases where NTFS-3g is not able to perform a write. It'll however refuse the operation in that case, so no damage will be done
2007-08-10T05:33:00.000Z	LiberCogito	Chousuke	Yes, and Vista is a stable groundbreaking OS.  Don't believe all the documentation you read.
2007-08-10T05:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	LiberCogito	I haven't really seen any reports of NTFS volumes broken by ntfs-3g yet.
2007-08-10T05:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	LiberCogito	But I do know it's widely used
2007-08-10T05:35:00.000Z	LiberCogito	Chousuke	don't read, eh?  googling "feisty ntfs write broken" returns 60,400 results.
2007-08-10T05:37:00.000Z	LiberCogito	Chousuke	you know what happened when I tried to write to NTFS?
2007-08-10T05:37:00.000Z	Chousuke	LiberCogito	with ntfs-3g?
2007-08-10T05:37:00.000Z	LiberCogito	Chousuke	It unmounted the drive.  permanently.  It could not be remount, no matter what I did.
2007-08-10T05:37:00.000Z	LiberCogito	Chousuke	yep.  had to reinstall ubuntu.
2007-08-10T05:37:00.000Z	LiberCogito	Chousuke	But hey, the documentation says it works, so that must be true!
2007-08-10T05:38:00.000Z	LiberCogito	Chousuke	It also completely corrupted a hard drive on a completely different computer.
2007-08-10T05:38:00.000Z	LiberCogito	Chousuke	Sounds like you're an idiot that believes any documentation.
2007-08-10T05:39:00.000Z	Chousuke	LiberCogito	I don't know what happened with your disk, but I resent being called an idiot. :P
2007-08-10T05:40:00.000Z	LiberCogito	Chousuke	And I resent that you think that your personal OPINION is somehow more relavent to an actual experience.
2007-08-10T05:40:00.000Z	Chousuke	LiberCogito	which version of ntfs-3g was this?
2007-08-10T05:40:00.000Z	LiberCogito	Chousuke	not at either computer,so I couldn't tell you.
2007-08-10T05:40:00.000Z	LiberCogito	Chousuke	Nor do I really care to.
2007-08-10T05:40:00.000Z	LiberCogito	Chousuke	Three other people witnessed both crashes.  It happened.  Deal.
