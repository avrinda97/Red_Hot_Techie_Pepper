2005-01-13T17:46:00.000Z	exlt	neighborlee	for what it is worth, I for one, do not want JRE/SDK installed by default, and appreciate those that do not force software on me - never miss not having it installed
2005-01-13T17:46:00.000Z	neighborlee	exlt	not forcing things is GOOD..making things a BITCH to install is NOT ;-)
2005-01-13T17:46:00.000Z	neighborlee	exlt	I presume you want linux to succeced as well yes ?
2005-01-13T17:47:00.000Z	exlt	neighborlee	in my opinion, it has - I have been using it since about 1996, and have a nice job supporting it's use on servers
2005-01-13T17:49:00.000Z	neighborlee	exlt	you said it -)..'servers'..desktop wize its still sucking back burner because of silly things like java not preinstalled....ask suzie to install java 'that way' and I guarantee you she will say: ' oh george get that POC off my hd right now and put windows back I'm not dealing with it' << why?..because windows makes it so easy: download: double click and play..you see my point ?
2005-01-13T17:52:00.000Z	exlt	neighborlee	and the 500 people that I work with, primarily use Linux on the desktop, right along with our secretaries, HR people, etc - you just don't seem to be working with the right enterprise-level-minded IT folks  ;)
2005-01-13T17:52:00.000Z	neighborlee	exlt	you said it...IT FOLKS
2005-01-13T17:53:00.000Z	neighborlee	exlt	no offense and i'm happy for 'your office'..but IT folks are NOT suze homemaker ;-))
2005-01-13T17:55:00.000Z	exlt	neighborlee	well, my wife, parents, brother, several 70-80+ year old neighbors which I have donated desktops - ALL non-technical people and using linux, don't seem to hold the same opinions that you are voicing so loudly...
2005-01-15T16:39:00.000Z	neighborlee	exlt	I agree '100%'
2005-01-15T16:39:00.000Z	neighborlee	exlt	I know...I've tried it and 'no thanks'
2005-01-15T16:40:00.000Z	neighborlee	exlt	I figure if I want to compile EVERYTHING ill just find job as a computer programmer..but in my real life I could care lesss ;-))
