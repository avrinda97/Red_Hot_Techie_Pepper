2007-01-16T15:58:00.000Z	niru		Jordan_U:do you know the solution
2007-01-16T15:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niru	Depends on the problem ;) whats wrong?
2007-01-16T16:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niru	Yes.
2007-01-16T16:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niru	I don't know, sorry :(
2007-01-16T16:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niru	Why are you compiling libtasn1-2 from source anyways?
2007-01-16T16:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niru	libtasn1-2 is available in the repos though
2007-01-16T16:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niru	libtasn1-2 is available in the repos though, why do you need to compile from source?
2007-01-16T16:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niru	Ahh, OK. sudo apt-get build-dep <package name> is a nice command but only works for packages that have a version in the repositories, so it would work in this case
2007-01-16T16:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niru	Yes, and not having the correct build dependencies is the most common problem when compiling :)
2007-01-16T16:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niru	sudo apt-get source --build libtasn1-2 if you are using the source package from the repositories.
2007-06-17T11:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niru	I don't know how but I don't see why not.
2007-06-17T11:33:00.000Z	niru	Jordan_U	I asked because ubuntu has a dark seen but I have a multi colour file
2007-06-20T11:10:00.000Z	niru	Jordan_U	any idea
2007-06-20T11:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	niru	Without knowing what caused the problem exactly I would suggest trying the alternate CD as it often works when the LiveCD does not
2007-06-20T11:13:00.000Z	niru	Jordan_U	I just created a cd and testing it shows the above problem
2007-06-20T11:14:00.000Z	niru	Jordan_U	could you guess what could be the problem
