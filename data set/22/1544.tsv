2010-04-15T22:14:00.000Z	g33kergRL		i'm having problems with step 4 in the install process, is there a guide with screen shots?
2010-04-15T22:16:00.000Z	g33kergRL		i can't find the step by step install guide with pics for 8.04!
2010-04-15T22:17:00.000Z	g33kergRL		i can't find the step by step install guide with pics for 8.04!
2010-04-15T22:18:00.000Z	Losha	g33kergRL	if you can't find a guide, come back. Maybe we can talk you through step 4. I've installed 8.04 lots of times...
2010-04-15T22:19:00.000Z	g33kergRL	Losha	please, help me i can't find a guide
2010-04-15T22:19:00.000Z	Losha	g33kergRL	so what is it you're stuck at?
2010-04-15T22:21:00.000Z	g33kergRL	Losha	1. it doesn't offer me dual booting and 2. i've created partitions but it says nowhere explicitely "i will install on those ext3 partitions and not wipe your ntfs partion, no way no how"
2010-04-15T22:22:00.000Z	Losha	g33kergRL	the best defense against that kind of mistake is to make a full backup of your ntfs partition before you install. That way, even the worst fumble will be recoverable...
2010-04-15T22:23:00.000Z	g33kergRL	Losha	i have that
2010-04-15T22:23:00.000Z	g33kergRL	Losha	do you know a solution?
2010-04-15T22:24:00.000Z	Losha	g33kergRL	ok, then the worst that can happen is you will have to do a restore if it all goes wrong. If you have manually partitioned, I recall there is a window in the partition editor where it says which partitions will be formatted (there's a column with checkmarks in it). Can you see that?
2010-04-15T22:26:00.000Z	g33kergRL	Losha	yes
2010-04-15T22:26:00.000Z	g33kergRL	Losha	if i check mark those drives the ohters will be safe?
2010-04-15T22:27:00.000Z	Losha	g33kergRL	only the partitions with format checkmarks will get their data erased, so as long as that's correct, you won't lose data. The rest will be untouched...
2010-04-15T22:31:00.000Z	Losha	g33kergRL	also, if I recall correctly, the boot manager has it's own little dialog which comes later in the installation process. Usually, it autodetects the windows installation and 'does the right thing'. If it doesn't, you can usually correct it manually after linux boots...
2010-04-16T06:54:00.000Z	g33kergRL	Losha	there's a fine line between responsible modding and Irc nazism
2010-04-16T06:55:00.000Z	Losha	g33kergRL	true, and I don't always agree with the ops either, but it was both off-topic *and* blue...
2010-04-16T06:56:00.000Z	Losha	g33kergRL	he's a smurf. And he's successfully trolled us....
2010-04-16T06:57:00.000Z	g33kergRL	Losha	ah, actually, i was saying TO phoebus "he's blue" about YOU ....
2010-04-16T06:57:00.000Z	Losha	g33kergRL	power corrupts, but intermittent power corrupts absolutely....
2010-04-16T06:57:00.000Z	g33kergRL	Losha	jokes about THAT i don't find funny at all
2010-04-16T06:58:00.000Z	Losha	g33kergRL	enough. Take it offtopic if you want to continue, ok?
