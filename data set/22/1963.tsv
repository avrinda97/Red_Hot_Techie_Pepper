2010-01-07T01:29:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	i recently had and solved this problem.  i shall explain
2010-01-07T01:30:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	go to System -> Preferences -> Sounds -> Applications (a tab, next to "Output")
2010-01-07T01:31:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	and there will be one for skype that is muted, scroll it up and hopefully you'll start hearing stuff.  i only had to do this once, then skype sound worked afterwards.
2010-01-07T01:32:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	you don't have to make skype use alsa.
2010-01-07T01:32:00.000Z	Rodensky	ozzloy	- where do i find these system prefs?
2010-01-07T01:32:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	"System" is at the top left of the screen usually
2010-01-07T01:32:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	next to Applications and Places
2010-01-07T01:33:00.000Z	Rodensky	ozzloy	- i have only system notifications on my gnome panel...
2010-01-07T01:34:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	do you have the sound icon?  you could right-click that and go down to "Preferences"
2010-01-07T01:34:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	sorry, "Sound Preferences"
2010-01-07T01:35:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	also, how do you not have anything in your gnome-panel other than system notifications?  did you remove everything?  you don't even have a clock?
2010-01-07T01:36:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	alternatively, you could go to terminal and type "gnome-volume-control"
2010-01-07T01:36:00.000Z	Rodensky	ozzloy	- i removed everything, all i usually need are just launchers..
2010-01-07T01:37:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	ok, go to "Applications"
2010-01-07T01:37:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	it's a tab next to "Output"
2010-01-07T01:37:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	make sure skype is running
2010-01-07T01:38:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	do you know what version of ubuntu you're running?
2010-01-07T01:38:00.000Z	Rodensky	ozzloy	9.04
2010-01-07T01:39:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	this might be a difference between 9.04 and 9.10 then, sorry
2010-01-07T01:39:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	in 9.10, skype shows up in the list of applications currently using sound, and one of the sliders was set to 0, so i moved it to 80-ish
2010-01-07T01:40:00.000Z	ozzloy	Rodensky	i suggest moving to 9.10.  good luck with all that.  i'm off to get lunch
2010-01-07T01:41:00.000Z	Rodensky	ozzloy	- i tried 9.10 and hated it, the sound worked but all other things did not. Bon apetit...
