2009-11-17T04:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	perscitus	only if you let it.. there is a manual partition and setup option on install..
2009-11-17T04:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	perscitus	you're wrong.. been doing it that way for 5 years
2009-11-17T04:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	perscitus	bootloader.. true.. however after install you can put it where you want it.
2009-11-17T04:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	perscitus	you didn't say bootloader previously.. just the install location.
2009-11-17T04:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	perscitus	you can do that with a windows cd.. fixmbrr
2009-11-17T04:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	perscitus	not sure about win7 but it worked on xp & vista
2009-11-17T04:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	perscitus	you can add the boot flag with gparted.. System>Admin>partiton manager .. if it's not there then sudo apt-get install gparted
2009-11-17T05:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	perscitus	once you fix the MBR how are you going to choose the linux install to boot?  will you use the windows boot loader to do it or change in the bios?
2009-11-17T05:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	perscitus	typically /
2009-11-17T05:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	perscitus	you can put grub anywhere.. or everywhere.. why not just use it where it landed?
2009-11-17T05:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	perscitus	ok.. I use to do that.. so you can put grub on both HDD's  and accomplish that.. the new grub is a little different though.. look for the right docs for grub2.. it's typically done from a "grub>" type prompt.
2009-11-17T05:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	perscitus	keep in mind though.. when you pull a drive the uuid or drive designations in grub might not reflect what the system is actually seeing... yes bot grubs will point to the linux hdd for the config.. thats where linux lives
2009-11-17T05:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	perscitus	uuid can also change based on the position of the drive on the motherboard.
2009-11-17T05:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	perscitus	ok.. good luck.. I"ve gotta run
