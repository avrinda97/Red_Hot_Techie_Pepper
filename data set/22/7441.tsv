2006-03-29T12:33:00.000Z	scotth	nestorm	whats up to my soundcard?
2006-03-29T12:33:00.000Z	scotth		are you asking what my soundcard is? or something else?
2006-03-29T12:34:00.000Z	nestorm		mmm, sorry scotth
2006-03-29T12:34:00.000Z	nestorm		I mean, you have a problem with your soundcard, do you?
2006-03-29T12:35:00.000Z	scotth		its cool
2006-03-29T12:35:00.000Z	scotth		Im trying to be able to play music while using team speak... my music is playing through esd and I understand that alsa supports dmix, but I can't get it to use it and provide multiple output
2006-03-29T12:36:00.000Z	nestorm		esd is quite outdated, isn't it?
2006-03-29T12:36:00.000Z	nestorm		you better use gstreamer
2006-03-29T12:37:00.000Z	scotth		if I use gstreamer then I only get one output to the sound card
2006-03-29T12:37:00.000Z	nestorm	scotth	how comes?
2006-03-29T12:37:00.000Z	scotth		plus my prefered music player is muine and it only uses 0.8.0
2006-03-29T12:37:00.000Z	nestorm		wich model is your soundcard?
2006-03-29T12:38:00.000Z	scotth		cause muine goes through gstreamer 0.8 and then I have gstreamer to use esd... when I set it to alsa I can only play one stream at a time
2006-03-29T12:38:00.000Z	scotth	nestorm	Ensoniq 5880 AudioPCI

2006-03-29T12:39:00.000Z	scotth		snd_ens1371
2006-03-29T12:40:00.000Z	nestorm	scotth	did you configure that or did ubuntu do it?
2006-03-29T12:41:00.000Z	scotth		configure what? the driver? naw its a stock dapper install... very little tweaking with the hardware(which makes me very happy)
2006-03-29T12:41:00.000Z	nestorm	scotth	that's great, but anyway, I don't know what could happen to your sound
2006-03-29T12:41:00.000Z	nestorm	scotth	are you runnig gnome or kde?
