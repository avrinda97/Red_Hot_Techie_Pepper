2005-06-06T07:37:00.000Z	danko123456		so, this xfce is better for memory consumption, and that?

2005-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	lalo	danko123456	much better; I have been using it for months, but I eventually got annoyed by the simple-mindedness of the panel and started gradually moving back to gnome
2005-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	danko123456		weklll, they should be able to ping it if they have teh ssame gateway.
2005-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	danko123456	lalo	better for mem management, that is what you are replying to, right?
2005-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	lalo	danko123456	yes
2005-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	danko123456		thanks.
2005-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	danko123456		Ill try that, I guess, I have some time.
2005-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	danko123456		I have to get a computer working...
2005-06-06T07:41:00.000Z	danko123456		and its a little older, and gnome used to bog it down too much.
2005-06-06T07:41:00.000Z	lalo	danko123456	for ex (about the panel), it's rather annoying how much work it is to create a launcher for something that you already have in the menu
2005-06-06T07:41:00.000Z	danko123456	lalo	aha...yeah...I guess.
2005-06-06T07:41:00.000Z	danko123456		Ill see.
2005-06-06T07:41:00.000Z	danko123456		Its for a girl, anyhow, I dont know, we'll see.
2005-06-06T07:42:00.000Z	danko123456		Il install warty, then upgrade.
2005-06-06T07:42:00.000Z	lalo	danko123456	on the other hand it took me a few months to get annoyed at it, so it's probably good enough :-)
