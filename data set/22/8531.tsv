2005-07-20T11:39:00.000Z	La_PaRCa		I think its time I update to hoary
2005-07-20T11:39:00.000Z	La_PaRCa		:/
2005-07-20T11:41:00.000Z	La_PaRCa		Is there a way to update from warty to hoary without install cds?
2005-07-20T11:42:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	La_PaRCa	yes. change warty to hoary in your /etc/apt/sources.list then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-07-20T11:43:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Computer__Guru	um, already did that. But I am still running XFree
2005-07-20T11:44:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	La_PaRCa	you should probably exit to cli before attempting a dist-upgrade
2005-07-20T11:45:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Computer__Guru	how to kill X?
2005-07-20T11:46:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	La_PaRCa	CTRL-ALT-F1 -then- login as root -then- killall -9 X && killall -9 gdm
2005-07-20T11:46:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	La_PaRCa	send me a msg, illw alk you through it step by step, you missed a step
2005-07-26T12:42:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	La_PaRCa	 ya got me, i was just offering up a ridiculously unpractical way to go at the problem :D
2005-07-26T12:45:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Computer__Guru	your way is not only impractical, its impossible.
2005-07-26T12:46:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	La_PaRCa	 is it? alrighty then, allow me to ammend my statement. You should instead download random pieces of the file, and see which one, when patched, corrects the checksum :D
2005-07-26T12:46:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Computer__Guru	oh, now that makes far more sense!
2005-07-28T11:02:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Computer__Guru	um, I just noticed I installed xfce not xfce4
2005-07-28T11:02:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Computer__Guru	uninstalled that and went for xfce4
2005-07-28T11:03:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Computer__Guru	another thing. My firefox started acting weird after the last update. It now doesnt open links to zip or pdf files for some reason.
2005-07-28T12:13:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Computer__Guru	who is ever gonna ask that tho?
2005-07-28T12:59:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Computer__Guru	thats what makes the community great.
2005-07-28T12:59:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	La_PaRCa	okay, my point was if you need instructions on how to use gaim... actually getting to the howto is out of the question, lol
2005-07-28T13:11:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Computer__Guru	ah, you have it easy
2005-07-28T13:11:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Computer__Guru	its not complex at all
2005-07-28T13:13:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Computer__Guru	rofl
