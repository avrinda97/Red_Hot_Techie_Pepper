2007-03-06T14:10:00.000Z	rickympl		everytime i try to send someone a file in xchat it times out, can anyone help me?
2007-03-06T14:11:00.000Z	LjL	rickympl	you have a router that does NAT.
2007-03-06T14:11:00.000Z	rickympl	LjL	but i have the ports that i use in xchat, routed in the router
2007-03-06T14:12:00.000Z	LjL	rickympl	those ports being what, 6667? that's not the port for DCCs

2007-03-06T14:13:00.000Z	rickympl	LjL	im using ports 10051 to 10070 and they r routed to my ip
2007-03-06T14:13:00.000Z	rickympl	LjL	ill take a look at that, thx
2007-03-06T14:15:00.000Z	LjL	rickympl	then it ought to work, if your IRC client is really using those ports... you aren't using some firewalling software or something like that?
2007-03-06T14:15:00.000Z	rickympl	LjL	i have nothing, at least i dont think so
2007-03-06T14:16:00.000Z	LjL	rickympl	try sending me a random file
2007-03-06T14:17:00.000Z	LjL	rickympl	it's trying to send to port 10051 indeed
2007-03-06T14:18:00.000Z	rickympl	LjL	so wut else might be wrong? iptables?
2007-03-06T14:19:00.000Z	LjL	rickympl	if you've never added any rules to iptables, no
2007-03-06T14:19:00.000Z	rickympl	LjL	nope
2007-03-06T14:19:00.000Z	LjL	rickympl	i'm portscanning you by the way - no harm intended of course, i'm just trying to see if i can find a clue
2007-03-06T14:19:00.000Z	rickympl	LjL	k
2007-03-06T14:21:00.000Z	rickympl	LjL	nevermind, i think i know y, i have one adsl modem that connects to adsl and to the router, this modem is not forwarding the port to the router
2007-03-06T14:21:00.000Z	LjL	rickympl	try typing "netcat -l -p 10051" (this will instruct your computer to listen for incoming TCP connections on port 10051 - tell me when you've typed this, i'll try to connect manually)
2007-03-06T14:22:00.000Z	LjL	rickympl	oh, if the modem is itself a router, that'll be it yeah
2007-03-06T14:22:00.000Z	rickympl	LjL	duh such a simple thin, i forgot to forward on that modem
2007-03-06T14:23:00.000Z	rickympl	LjL	thx
2007-03-06T16:01:00.000Z	rickympl	LjL	i think i fixed the port forwarding prob, can i try to send u a file to c?
