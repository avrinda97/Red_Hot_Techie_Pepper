2007-03-15T14:46:00.000Z	Julie		how can i make a shortcut with a file on the desktop like i used to do with windows?
2007-03-15T14:46:00.000Z	cables	Julie	right click > make link
2007-03-15T14:58:00.000Z	cables	Julie	Ubotu is a bot.
2007-03-15T15:00:00.000Z	cables	Julie	you create the link there, then drag it to the desktop.
2007-03-15T15:03:00.000Z	cables	Julie	hold on, let me go through this from the beginning.
2007-03-15T15:03:00.000Z	cables	Julie	please go to the external drive and right click the My Documents folder, then click Make Link.
2007-03-15T15:04:00.000Z	cables	Julie	is the external drive a Windows drive?
2007-03-15T15:04:00.000Z	cables	Julie	Windows drive?
2007-03-15T15:05:00.000Z	cables	Julie	is that a My Documents folder from Windows?
2007-03-15T15:06:00.000Z	cables	Julie	try saving a file to that drive to test things
2007-03-15T15:07:00.000Z	cables	Julie	sure... it doesn't matter
2007-03-15T15:08:00.000Z	Julie	cables	i did, worked
2007-03-15T15:08:00.000Z	cables	Julie	ok.
2007-03-15T15:09:00.000Z	cables	Julie	can you open a terminal?
2007-03-15T15:09:00.000Z	cables	Julie	what did bafoc say?
2007-03-15T15:09:00.000Z	cables	Julie	that will sorta work but it's not ideal
2007-03-15T15:10:00.000Z	cables	Julie	let's try something else first.
2007-03-15T15:11:00.000Z	cables	Julie	!who | Julie was a command to tell Ubotu to tell you to use my nick in front of messages to me :)
2007-03-15T15:11:00.000Z	cables	Julie	do you know the path to that documents folder?
2007-03-15T15:11:00.000Z	cables	Julie	not the right place to talk about this, let's deal with your link problem first.
2007-03-15T15:12:00.000Z	cables	Julie	can we PM? This is a bit too hectic
2007-03-15T15:13:00.000Z	cables	Julie	can you type this? /join #cables2
