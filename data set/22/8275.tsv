2005-09-19T14:34:00.000Z	sipior	vladuz976	well, what sort of errors
2005-09-19T14:35:00.000Z	sipior		?
2005-09-19T14:35:00.000Z	vladuz976	sipior	man: can't set the locale; make sure $LC_* and $LANG are correct
2005-09-19T14:35:00.000Z	sipior	vladuz976	what does "echo $LANG" and "echo $LC_ALL" say?
2005-09-19T14:36:00.000Z	vladuz976	sipior	echo $LANG says "en" and echo $LC_ALL
2005-09-19T14:36:00.000Z	vladuz976		 is blank
2005-09-19T14:37:00.000Z	sipior	vladuz976	try "export LANG=en_US.UTF-8" and "export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8" and then retry
2005-09-19T14:38:00.000Z	sipior	vladuz976	assuming english is what you want :)
2005-09-19T14:38:00.000Z	vladuz976	sipior	yes, english is what i want
2005-09-19T14:39:00.000Z	vladuz976	sipior	but that will only be for that term, right?
2005-09-19T14:39:00.000Z	sipior	vladuz976	yeah, you'll have to add it to .bashrc or the like
2005-09-19T14:39:00.000Z	vladuz976	sipior	how just at the end?
2005-09-19T14:39:00.000Z	sipior	vladuz976	that'd be fine
2005-09-19T14:40:00.000Z	vladuz976	sipior	i am just wondering what happened that i need to change it now
2005-09-19T14:40:00.000Z	sipior	vladuz976	i couldn't say
2005-09-19T14:41:00.000Z	vladuz976	sipior	but if i add it to .bashrc it will always be set the right way for this user right?
2005-09-19T14:42:00.000Z	sipior	vladuz976	yes, should be. though you might want to add it to .gnomerc, if that's what you use. .bashrc will only set it for applications you launch from the shell
2005-09-19T14:42:00.000Z	vladuz976	sipior	i use enlightenment 17
2005-09-19T14:43:00.000Z	vladuz976	sipior	actually this occured the first time when i got bluefish with aptitude
2005-09-19T14:43:00.000Z	sipior	vladuz976	not sure if e17 sources .bash_profile on login, but try adding it there and make sure it's propagated when you restart your X window session
2005-09-19T14:44:00.000Z	vladuz976	sipior	just add the same to that file at the end?
2005-09-19T14:44:00.000Z	sipior	vladuz976	yep
