2012-01-09T08:06:00.000Z	Glacia		can anyone help me update to 11.10 please
2012-01-09T08:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Glacia	what release are you on now?
2012-01-09T08:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Glacia	its a good first thing. I have no way of knowing what you have tried, do I?
2012-01-09T08:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Glacia	if you run:  sudo apt-get update     is it smooth with no warnings about keys or 404s?
2012-01-09T08:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Glacia	Assuming it's smooth, run: sudo apt-get install update-manager-core; gksudo gedit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades          change:  Prompt=lts   to: Prompt=normal    if necessary, save the new file, close gedit then run: sudo do-release-upgrade
