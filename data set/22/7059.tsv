2007-07-24T11:36:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn		which torrent client will let me seed more then one file at a time?
2007-07-24T11:36:00.000Z	bruenig	wckdkl0wn	almost all of them
2007-07-24T11:37:00.000Z	bruenig	wckdkl0wn	in fact I can't think of one that won't
2007-07-24T11:37:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	bruenig	only one i got to work was the default one that came with ubuntu.. but i cant open more then one file cause it says that the port is in use
2007-07-24T12:18:00.000Z	bruenig	wckdkl0wn	gnome-desktop is a meta package, it doesn't matter just remove it
2007-07-24T12:18:00.000Z	bruenig	wckdkl0wn	yes ubuntu-desktop I meant too, weird that we both erred
2007-07-24T12:19:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	bruenig	so its ok to remove that? that wont mess up my desktop?
2007-07-24T12:19:00.000Z	bruenig	wckdkl0wn	yes remove it, it is one of the unfortunate flaws of apt that it is even necessary
2007-07-24T12:23:00.000Z	bruenig	wckdkl0wn	$(dpkg -L bittornado | grep \/usr\/bin)
2007-07-24T12:23:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	bruenig	what do i do with that?
2007-07-24T12:24:00.000Z	bruenig	wckdkl0wn	copy and paste it
2007-07-24T12:24:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	bruenig	bash: /usr/bin: is a directory
2007-07-24T12:24:00.000Z	bruenig	wckdkl0wn	copy and paste the entire thing at once including the dollar parenthesis
2007-07-24T12:25:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	bruenig	i did and i put it in terminal and it gave me that
2007-07-24T12:25:00.000Z	bruenig	wckdkl0wn	ok do this: $(dpkg -L bittornado | grep \/usr\/bin/.)
2007-07-24T12:25:00.000Z	bruenig	wckdkl0wn	ok do this: $(dpkg -L bittornado | grep \/usr\/bin\/.)
2007-07-24T12:26:00.000Z	bruenig	wckdkl0wn	did you do that second one?
2007-07-24T12:26:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	bruenig	yea got an error   http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31036/
2007-07-24T12:29:00.000Z	bruenig	wckdkl0wn	looks like the app is broken or there are missing dependencies
2007-10-19T02:03:00.000Z	bruenig	wckdkl0wn	checking mirrors could mean that it is going through each of them to test speed which would obviously take some time, abstraction makes it hard to understand what is going on so yeah could be that. Hooray gui.
2007-10-19T02:04:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	bruenig	its been at 82% for the past 20 mins lol
2007-10-19T02:04:00.000Z	bruenig	wckdkl0wn	well user-friendliness takes precedence over usefulness so just wait I guess or kill it, whichever
