2012-01-27T21:57:00.000Z	nyrpnz	gunfire	my guess is paros is a command-line tool?
2012-01-27T21:57:00.000Z	gunfire	nyrpnz	when i run paros in terminal a GUI interface in displayed
2012-01-27T21:58:00.000Z	nyrpnz	gunfire	I'd suggest System-Preferences-Main Menu
2012-01-27T21:58:00.000Z	gunfire	nyrpnz	it's not over there, i chk it thrice .. :(
2012-01-27T21:59:00.000Z	nyrpnz	gunfire	you can add it manually with System->preferences->main menu
2012-01-27T22:00:00.000Z	gunfire	nyrpnz	what's the defualt directory where this application gets installed ?
2012-01-27T22:02:00.000Z	nyrpnz	gunfire	somewhere in system files... what are you trying to do exactly?
2012-01-27T22:03:00.000Z	gunfire	nyrpnz	in mainmenu, when i am trying to create a launcher of that program it is asking me about the directory of the program where it is installed so that it can link to it.
2012-01-27T22:04:00.000Z	nyrpnz	gunfire	the application should be in system path
2012-01-27T22:04:00.000Z	gunfire	nyrpnz	where in system path ??
2012-01-27T22:04:00.000Z	nyrpnz	gunfire	if you can launch it from the terminal with "paros" the same thing should work in the application dialog
2012-01-27T22:05:00.000Z	gunfire	nyrpnz	ok let me try it
