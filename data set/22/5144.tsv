2008-05-31T00:40:00.000Z	Dr_Link	gordonjcp	I asked twice, without asking first... and I was ignored both times
2008-05-31T00:40:00.000Z	Dr_Link		In the Sound manager, I have set up to Ensoniq AudioPCI (which is the ONLY PCI one listed, I have integrated sound disabled and the speakers plugged into the sound card
2008-05-31T00:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dr_Link	I don't care
2008-05-31T00:40:00.000Z	Dr_Link		when I play a test sound, I hear a "beeeeeeeeep" from the speakers. When I play any other sound, such as that from a .avi file or from .mp3 files that I know work, because I previously could use sound... I hear silence.
2008-05-31T00:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dr_Link	ask the question, I'm not crawling back through a mile of text to find it
2008-05-31T00:40:00.000Z	Dr_Link		I just did.
2008-05-31T00:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dr_Link	ok, *no* sounds play at all apart from the test sound?
2008-05-31T00:41:00.000Z	Dr_Link		That is correct.
2008-05-31T00:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dr_Link	in Preferences are all the sound settings set to ALSA?
2008-05-31T00:42:00.000Z	Dr_Link		<gordonjcp> Dr_Link: in Preferences are all the sound settings set to ALSA? <-- yes.
2008-05-31T00:44:00.000Z	Dr_Link		<Warbo> Dr_Link, perhaps it's to do with gstreamer or something? Try looking in gstreamer-properties <-- I see nothing wrong.
2008-05-31T00:45:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dr_Link	can you play back any .wav files?
2008-05-31T00:45:00.000Z	Dr_Link		.wav?
2008-05-31T00:46:00.000Z	Dr_Link		I don't believe I have any .wav
2008-05-31T00:46:00.000Z	Dr_Link		I have .mp3, though.
2008-05-31T00:46:00.000Z	Dr_Link		Hrm, it seems to be playing now.
2008-05-31T00:46:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dr_Link	ok, what have you got it playing?
2008-05-31T00:47:00.000Z	Dr_Link		some .mp3's I downloaded.
2008-05-31T00:47:00.000Z	Dr_Link		Plays perfectly.
2008-05-31T00:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dr_Link	hm
2008-05-31T00:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dr_Link	bit of an odd one, what did you change?
