2006-10-08T13:10:00.000Z	SeraVitae		could anyone suggest an email server for linux that i could use? i wish to setup an IMAP system so i can get my pop3 emails stored on my home server so i can browse them at uni
2006-10-08T13:11:00.000Z	SeraVitae		actually i'd like some fancy web interface one that had a calendar and stuff in it, but fat chance.
2006-10-08T13:12:00.000Z	Arafangion	SeraVitae	You seem to be confusing IMAP with POP3
2006-10-08T13:12:00.000Z	SeraVitae	Arafangion	- not really.
2006-10-08T13:12:00.000Z	Arafangion	SeraVitae	Ahh, I see.  Use postfix, dovecot, and fetchmail.
2006-10-08T13:18:00.000Z	SeraVitae	Arafangion	- mdaemon was nice
2006-10-08T13:18:00.000Z	Arafangion	SeraVitae	Who the heck decides that "logging" is merely a feature added in version EIGHT of their server?
2006-10-08T13:19:00.000Z	SeraVitae	Arafangion	- who the hell gets upset about pedantic things and misformed expectations?
2006-10-08T13:19:00.000Z	Arafangion	SeraVitae	logging isn't exactly a "pedantic" expectation.
2006-10-08T13:20:00.000Z	Arafangion	SeraVitae	Suppose you download and setup your fancy email server.
2006-10-08T13:20:00.000Z	Arafangion	SeraVitae	And one day it stops working - how do you find out what is wrong, without logs?
2006-10-08T13:21:00.000Z	Arafangion	SeraVitae	Or suppose you have to investigate some issue, how do you do so, without logs?
2006-10-08T13:21:00.000Z	SeraVitae	Arafangion	- but by that time, it won't matter, because your head would've exploded.
2006-10-08T13:22:00.000Z	Arafangion	SeraVitae	How so?
2006-10-08T13:22:00.000Z	SeraVitae	Arafangion	- never mind
2006-10-08T13:22:00.000Z	Arafangion	SeraVitae	Heck, how do the *developers* implement the damn thing without some logging?
2006-10-08T13:30:00.000Z	Arafangion	SeraVitae	Unlimited, eh?
2006-10-08T13:30:00.000Z	Arafangion	SeraVitae	I've only got 1.5mbit/s :(
2006-10-08T13:31:00.000Z	Arafangion	SeraVitae	Then, I have three times the bandwidth than you.
2006-10-08T13:31:00.000Z	Arafangion	SeraVitae	You have unlimited downloads - not unlimited bandwidth.
2006-10-08T13:31:00.000Z	SeraVitae	Arafangion	- you need a spliff dude. :D
2006-10-08T13:32:00.000Z	Arafangion	SeraVitae	Trust me, there's a huge difference when you start managing servers.
