2006-07-27T10:39:00.000Z	ttyfscker		fusionxn1:: where di you get xchat from?
2006-07-27T10:40:00.000Z	ttyfscker		fusionxn1:: do apt-get install xchat
2006-07-27T10:40:00.000Z	ttyfscker		umm
2006-07-27T10:41:00.000Z	ttyfscker		fusionxn1:: its the extra stuff.. the good stuff usually
2006-07-27T10:41:00.000Z	ttyfscker		fusionxn1:: it runs fine
2006-07-27T10:42:00.000Z	ttyfscker		fusionxn1:: add universe to your /etc/apt/source.list
2006-07-27T10:42:00.000Z	ttyfscker		you can do it in synaptic too
2006-07-27T10:42:00.000Z	ttyfscker		under the repo config..
2006-07-27T10:43:00.000Z	ttyfscker		redcard:: yea go ahead and help him.. i dont run the gui
2006-07-27T10:44:00.000Z	ttyfscker		i think n00bs should learn the cli first instead of getting spoiled to a gui..  often that is the case and people avoid the powerful features in the cli. and then they complain later that linux isnt working as good as windows..
2006-07-27T10:46:00.000Z	nevyn	ttyfscker	don't get me wrong the cmdline rocks but at the end of the day filling your head with arcane commands and syntaxes isn't what people need a computer to do.
2006-07-27T10:46:00.000Z	nevyn	ttyfscker	computers can become something of their own end
2006-07-27T10:46:00.000Z	nevyn	ttyfscker	while I agree with you to soem extent
2006-07-27T10:47:00.000Z	nevyn	ttyfscker	I can most likely do things in vi and bash that'd make your head spin
2006-07-27T10:48:00.000Z	nevyn	ttyfscker	yeah but most of them learned enough to have a simple menu that got them into wordperfect 5 or into lotus 123
2006-07-27T10:50:00.000Z	nevyn	ttyfscker	I'd probably use cp but the majority of people would use a file manager like nautilus or konq for that task
2006-07-27T10:51:00.000Z	nevyn	ttyfscker	the majority of people in the WORLD would us a file browser
2006-07-27T10:52:00.000Z	nevyn	ttyfscker	no but we're not talking about best practice here...
2006-07-27T10:53:00.000Z	nevyn	ttyfscker	that's bs and you know it.
2006-07-27T10:53:00.000Z	nevyn	ttyfscker	there are layers that you just don't care about... and don't worry about
2006-07-27T10:55:00.000Z	nevyn	ttyfscker	you're not starting at the bottom
2006-07-27T10:55:00.000Z	nevyn	ttyfscker	the bottom would be the kernel then the c library then the shell etc
