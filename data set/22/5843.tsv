2007-03-03T12:24:00.000Z	mag_		helllo, when i boot with a usb-disk plugged in the system hangs, how can i solve this ?
2007-03-03T12:24:00.000Z	slippyr4	mag_	hangs how? does linux at least partially start? and errors?
2007-03-03T12:26:00.000Z	mag_	slippyr4	well the system starts to boot and after 5s it hangs
2007-03-03T12:27:00.000Z	slippyr4	mag_	do you see anything to do with linux? or is it just your bios stuff ?
2007-03-03T12:28:00.000Z	slippyr4	mag_	: are you using edgy or dapper
2007-03-03T12:29:00.000Z	mag_	slippyr4	edgy
2007-03-03T12:30:00.000Z	slippyr4	mag_	can you boot *without* the usb stuck in?
2007-03-03T12:30:00.000Z	mag_	slippyr4	yes works fine
2007-03-03T12:31:00.000Z	slippyr4	mag_	when you try to boot from the USB, when it hangs, does it say something about waiting for root filesystem? or a kernel-panic, unable to find root fs?
2007-03-03T12:33:00.000Z	mag_	slippyr4	no i am not booting from it . and it somehow starts to start linux ... well I will try again to get the excqct error ... one second
2007-03-03T12:45:00.000Z	slippyr4	mag_	but did you see any errors at the point it hung?
2007-03-03T12:48:00.000Z	mag_	slippyr4	yes - well actually there is no error
2007-03-03T12:48:00.000Z	slippyr4	mag_	did it say anything about root filesystems?
2007-03-03T12:48:00.000Z	mag_	slippyr4	i get : [17179576.628000]  hub 2-0:1.0: USB hub found   [17179576.628000]  hub 2-0:1.0: 3 ports detected
2007-03-03T12:49:00.000Z	slippyr4	mag_	perhaps pastebin your dmesg output, and highlight where it hung
2007-03-03T12:50:00.000Z	mag_	slippyr4	than it hangs and when i unplug the disk it continues with : [17179577.524000]  PCI: Enabling device 0000:00:1c.3 (0000 -> 0002) [17179577.524000]  ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1c.3[D]  -> GSI 23 (level, low) -> IRQ 193  [17179577.524000]  ehci_hcd 0000:00:1c.3: EHCI Host Controller [17179577.524000]  ehci_hcd 0000:00:1c.3: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 3
2007-03-03T12:51:00.000Z	slippyr4	mag_	it's not what i thought it might be then. ooi, can you access that usb key if you plug it in after you've booted?
2007-03-03T12:58:00.000Z	mag_	slippyr4	yes - do you still want me to paste my dmesg output ?
2007-03-03T12:58:00.000Z	slippyr4	mag_	no need
2007-03-03T12:59:00.000Z	mag_	slippyr4	its  a fat fs might that be a problem ?
2007-03-03T12:59:00.000Z	slippyr4	mag_	it should not matter in the slightest
2007-03-03T13:01:00.000Z	slippyr4	mag_	maybe your stick is a bit knackered
