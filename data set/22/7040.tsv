2006-09-04T05:11:00.000Z	JohnsonE		is there any way i can associate torrents with utorrent AND have it open with wine?
2006-09-04T05:11:00.000Z	liquidten2	JohnsonE	 type int he following:
2006-09-04T05:11:00.000Z	liquidten2	JohnsonE	pico /usr/bin/TORRENT
2006-09-04T05:11:00.000Z	liquidten2	JohnsonE	"sudo nano /usr/bin/TORRENT" to be specific
2006-09-04T05:12:00.000Z	JohnsonE	liquidten2	it yped pico /usr/bin/TORRENT, should I do the other?
2006-09-04T05:12:00.000Z	liquidten2	JohnsonE	You should use Sudo, and make sure you have at least some editor editing the file
2006-09-04T05:13:00.000Z	liquidten2	JohnsonE	then type in "/usr/bin/wine /home/username/.wine/drive_c/Program\ files/WHERE/EVER/utorrent/IS.exe"
2006-09-04T05:13:00.000Z	liquidten2	JohnsonE	then press control+x and choose to save it
2006-09-04T05:14:00.000Z	liquidten2	JohnsonE	then type in "sudo chmod+x /usr/bin/TORRENT", and then right click on a torrent file, choose properties, find "open with", choose an "other" option, and type in manually the command "TORRENT".
2006-09-04T05:17:00.000Z	liquidten2	JohnsonE	"chmod +x /usr/bin/TORRENT"
2006-09-04T05:21:00.000Z	liquidten2	JohnsonE	What does "cat `which TORRENT` say.
2006-09-04T05:21:00.000Z	liquidten2	JohnsonE	copy and paste the command.  It uses the ````` key next to the `, above the tab.
2006-09-04T05:22:00.000Z	liquidten2	JohnsonE	"/usr/bin/wine  /home/ssb/.wine/etcetcetc"
2006-09-04T05:24:00.000Z	liquidten2	JohnsonE	type the command, "TORRENT"
2006-09-04T05:25:00.000Z	liquidten2	JohnsonE	make the text file read:  "/usr/bin/wine /home/ssb/.wine/drive_c/Program\ files/utorrent.exe"  Notice the lack of slash after wine.
