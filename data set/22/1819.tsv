2009-12-29T08:58:00.000Z	ezra14		luis: ok, i'm back.
2009-12-29T08:59:00.000Z	luisgmarine	ezra14	what program are you using to chat?
2009-12-29T09:00:00.000Z	luisgmarine	ezra14	say my full name so I can see it, since x-chat highlights all text with my name on it
2009-12-29T09:00:00.000Z	ezra14	luisgmarine	pidgin, on windows xp. i have ubuntu up right now
2009-12-29T09:00:00.000Z	luisgmarine	ezra14	sweet that works
2009-12-29T09:01:00.000Z	luisgmarine	ezra14	ok, open up terminal and type in "sudo lshw -C network" without the quotes
2009-12-29T09:03:00.000Z	ezra14	luisgmarine	ok, i did that, but then it says password for ezra, and it won't let me type right next to it, so i have to press enter, and then it gives me like a second to type in my password, which isn't enough time
2009-12-29T09:03:00.000Z	luisgmarine		lol
2009-12-29T09:03:00.000Z	luisgmarine	ezra14	ok when it asks you for the password just type in your regular user password
2009-12-29T09:05:00.000Z	ezra14	luisgmarine	i don't have the opportunity to type anything. it says "password for ezra:" i can't type on this line, so i have to go to the line below it, but then after like a second it says "sorry, try again"
2009-12-29T09:05:00.000Z	luisgmarine	ezra14	that's fine, when you are typing that password you aren't suppose to see anything
2009-12-29T09:07:00.000Z	luisgmarine	ezra14	did it work?
2009-12-29T09:07:00.000Z	ezra14	luisgmarine	ooooh. ok ok. i got it. i thought it was just trying to piss me off
