2010-08-18T12:14:00.000Z	Gnea	etherealite	that was meant for you ^^^
2010-08-18T12:14:00.000Z	etherealite	Gnea	USB Microsoft Microsoft 3-Button Mouse with IntelliEye(TM)
2010-08-18T12:15:00.000Z	etherealite	Gnea	Its looking like I need to write a udev rule
2010-08-18T12:15:00.000Z	Gnea	etherealite	is it slow all the time or only if it's plugged/unplugged?
2010-08-18T12:16:00.000Z	Gnea	etherealite	have you checked the laser portion on the bottom of the mouse to make sure there isn't like a small hair or piece of lint in the way?
2010-08-18T12:22:00.000Z	etherealite	Gnea	yes I have checked for hair and stuff, there's none, plus it works fine with windows.
2010-08-18T12:26:00.000Z	Gnea	etherealite	have you tried it with gpm?
2010-08-18T12:33:00.000Z	etherealite	Gnea	does gpm that work with xorg?
2010-08-18T12:35:00.000Z	Gnea	etherealite	yes, you can switch between console and X and still have a working mouse.... well, that's a matter of debate at this point :)
2010-08-18T12:38:00.000Z	etherealite	Gnea	seems to me like its not going to help me when I'm in X, only in console .
2010-08-18T12:39:00.000Z	Gnea	etherealite	point is, will it be slow in console or not?
2010-08-18T12:59:00.000Z	Gnea	etherealite	of course you do, one is for 9.10 the other is for 10.04
2010-08-18T12:59:00.000Z	etherealite	Gnea	look closer specifically this line in the 9.10 docs:  The x11_options properties are not supported in Ubuntu 10.04. Use xorg.conf.d snippets instead.
2010-08-18T13:00:00.000Z	Gnea	etherealite	exactly.
2010-08-18T13:00:00.000Z	Gnea	etherealite	still, you should be able to use GpM.
2010-08-18T13:02:00.000Z	etherealite	Gnea	I know I can use gpm when i'm doing console work, but most of my work is done in X in a web browser.
2010-08-18T13:02:00.000Z	Gnea	etherealite	you still haven't answered my question: is the mouse still slow with gpm or not?
2010-08-18T13:03:00.000Z	etherealite	Gnea	haven't tried yet be right back.
2010-08-18T13:27:00.000Z	etherealite	Gnea	I tested out gpm like you said. Mouse was still slow.
2010-08-18T13:28:00.000Z	Gnea	etherealite	okay, so the problem is definately with the mouse, or the way the protocol is trying to work
2010-08-18T13:31:00.000Z	etherealite	Gnea	so if I know that the problem is with udev?
2010-08-18T13:31:00.000Z	Gnea	etherealite	well, I wouldn't say udev is the problem, but likely the solution
