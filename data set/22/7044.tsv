2008-07-30T00:04:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		Bogus8; after you start a shell you could do sudo bash .. that would have the current terminal running as root. dangerous but do'able
2008-07-30T00:05:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	well, in my other installs I always set up visudo to not ask via "<username>        ALL= NOPASSWD:  ALL"
2008-07-30T00:06:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	well, that is what I'm trying to achieve actually... I want to be able to sudo without the need for the password.. not just sudo into a root shell.. but anytime I sudo
2008-07-30T00:08:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	well, I don't want to ALWAYS sudo, i just don't want the password prompt when I do
2008-07-30T00:12:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	I will try that out... but why isn't the same line from my debian box working on this box?
2008-07-30T00:13:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	but sudo is sudo :p
2008-07-30T00:13:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	if it is different I can accept that... but that is all I was asking is is it different and if so then  how do I fix it... you seem to have answered that... thanks
2008-07-30T00:14:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	thank you for assisting me against your better judgement ;)
2008-07-30T00:15:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	don't guess there is a way to make visudo work like debian (IE: it edits it in nano essentially)
2008-07-30T00:15:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	RAWR!! chaos! ;)
2008-07-30T00:16:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	and that will change which one visudo evokes?
2008-07-30T00:17:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	cool, will be a good thing to know if it works! ;)
2008-07-30T00:21:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	not to keep pressing the issue but shouldn't that same visudo line work if instead of /usr/bin/sudo you just had ALL ?
2008-07-30T00:24:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	right, just in other lines they use "ALL" like for root and stuff... and I've done it before.. .just never on ubuntu
2008-07-30T00:24:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	ALL meaning all commands obviously
2008-07-30T00:26:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	roger... thanks for you assistance... it's hard to tell if it's working right away with the timestamp thing ;)
2008-07-30T00:27:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	oh, I got several open here ;)  so each new terminal (log in) is a new timestamp?
2008-07-30T00:32:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	:p I had this problem before :p
2008-07-30T00:33:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	oh, I missed the question ;)
2008-07-30T00:33:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	haha.. yeah, that's my fault :p
2008-07-30T00:34:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	well, it's not rocket science and I've done it a dozen times before (and multiple keys per box)
2008-07-30T00:39:00.000Z	Bogus8	bastid_raZor	I looked at the keys in nano (my old faithful editor) and it looks fine... I even moved "known host" just to eliminate that and still "Permission denied (publickey)."
