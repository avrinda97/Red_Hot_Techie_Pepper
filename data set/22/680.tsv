2011-05-17T13:01:00.000Z	raviepic3		people i installed eclipse in /opt directory, but i want to launch the program without going to the particular directory. I heard i need to set path. when i google it they talk about writing the bin directory inside profile.d file
2011-05-17T13:01:00.000Z	raviepic3		that the way ?
2011-05-17T13:02:00.000Z	danslo	raviepic3	without going to the particular directory? just use a launcher imo, why would you want to start eclipse from console anyway
2011-05-17T13:03:00.000Z	raviepic3	danslo	not eclipse, any custom installed applications i want to launch by pressing Alt+f2 and hit the command
2011-05-17T13:05:00.000Z	raviepic3	danslo	thank you will have a look now
2011-05-17T13:05:00.000Z	raviepic3	danslo	++
2011-05-17T13:06:00.000Z	danslo	raviepic3	oh actually, people recommend "Gnome Do" instead of launchy :) may be worth checking out more
2011-05-17T13:08:00.000Z	raviepic3	danslo	launchy not in ubuntu repo nor does gnome-do
2011-05-17T13:08:00.000Z	danslo	raviepic3	they may have deprecated gnome-do in favor of unity (it works similarly, I guess)
2011-05-17T13:09:00.000Z	raviepic3	danslo	these search utilities will eat more hardware resources in the process of indexing ?
2011-05-17T13:09:00.000Z	danslo	raviepic3	but actually gnome do is in my repositories :)
2011-05-17T13:09:00.000Z	raviepic3	danslo	which version of ubuntu you are running ?
2011-05-17T13:09:00.000Z	danslo	raviepic3	probably, but I dont think it will be at all noticable
2011-05-17T13:10:00.000Z	danslo	raviepic3	natty
2011-05-17T13:10:00.000Z	raviepic3	danslo	my bad, even i have it in my repo
2011-05-17T13:11:00.000Z	danslo	raviepic3	I've only ever used gnome do
2011-05-17T13:12:00.000Z	raviepic3	danslo	oh
2011-05-17T13:16:00.000Z	raviepic3	danslo	yeah, gnome-do searches for existing commands
2011-05-17T13:16:00.000Z	danslo	raviepic3	if I remember correctly there are a bunch of plugins you can enable/disable too :)
2011-05-17T13:17:00.000Z	raviepic3	danslo	yeah, amazing. looking at it as we speak
2011-05-17T13:22:00.000Z	raviepic3	danslo	export PATH=${PATH}:/opt/eclipse worked
2011-05-17T13:22:00.000Z	danslo	raviepic3	np :)
