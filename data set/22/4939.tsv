2008-01-31T02:45:00.000Z	brandon__		flare183, i had to install package esound and set Sound Events to ESD to get sound events to work.... will not work with alsa
2008-01-31T02:46:00.000Z	brandon__		you really want ultimate ubuntu
2008-01-31T02:47:00.000Z	brandon__		is there any all in one gnome multimedia thing?
2008-01-31T02:47:00.000Z	nemilar	brandon__	that's what totem is
2008-01-31T02:48:00.000Z	nemilar	brandon__	but the consensus is that totem is The Worst Program Ever Written
2008-01-31T02:48:00.000Z	brandon__	nemilar	no... with a library, kinda like rhytembox
2008-01-31T02:48:00.000Z	nemilar	brandon__	you mean that does both music and movies?
2008-01-31T02:48:00.000Z	brandon__	nemilar	yes
2008-01-31T02:49:00.000Z	nemilar	brandon__	hmm, not that I know of..
2008-01-31T02:49:00.000Z	brandon__	nemilar	kinda like windows media player... no offence to anyone
2008-01-31T02:49:00.000Z	nemilar	brandon__	I think the new version of totem is supposed to have library support, or something
2008-01-31T02:49:00.000Z	nemilar	brandon__	will be out in a couple of months
2008-01-31T02:50:00.000Z	brandon__	nemilar	ok.. guess ill just have to wait
2008-01-31T02:59:00.000Z	nemilar	brandon__	which p3p service?
2008-01-31T03:00:00.000Z	brandon__	nemilar	gnutella with build in playback support... if possible
2008-01-31T03:00:00.000Z	brandon__	nemilar	not limewire though
2008-01-31T03:00:00.000Z	nemilar	brandon__	I don't think you'll find one with play-back support
2008-01-31T03:00:00.000Z	nemilar	brandon__	the unix philosophy is generally, "one program, one task" or "do one thing and do it right"
2008-01-31T03:01:00.000Z	brandon__	nemilar	yeah, i can understand that, but gtk-gnutella doesnt even let you launch the song with a different app, you have to open it manually
2008-01-31T03:03:00.000Z	nemilar	brandon__	I think that's the only one out there...most people these days use bittorrent
2008-01-31T03:03:00.000Z	nemilar	brandon__	clients for old p2p networks don't get much attention anymore
2008-01-31T03:06:00.000Z	nemilar	brandon__	there are a slew of them... ktorrent, azureus, deluge, transmission ... it's a personal-taste thing
