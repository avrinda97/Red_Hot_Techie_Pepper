2006-06-07T10:26:00.000Z	adrigen		hello...
2006-06-07T10:26:00.000Z	adrigen		i have a question which I think should be simpl
2006-06-07T10:26:00.000Z	adrigen		e but im stuck...
2006-06-07T10:26:00.000Z	adrigen		how do I install a "binary"?
2006-06-07T10:27:00.000Z	JerKB	adrigen	if it's a deb, use dpkg -i <filename>
2006-06-07T10:28:00.000Z	adrigen	JerKB	so i dont uncompress it first?
2006-06-07T10:28:00.000Z	JerKB	adrigen	nope, dpkg takes care of that.
2006-06-07T10:31:00.000Z	adrigen	JerKB	"dpkg: requested operation requires superuser privilege
2006-06-07T10:31:00.000Z	JerKB	adrigen	oops, put sudo in front of it.  sudo dpkg -i <filename>
2006-06-07T10:40:00.000Z	adrigen	JerKB	I get "sudo dpkg -i Home/downloaded/ConsultComm-3.1.1.zip
2006-06-07T10:40:00.000Z	JerKB	adrigen	 err... ok if it's a .zip you'll have to extract that, yes.  Then look for a file possibly with a .bin extention.
2006-06-07T10:41:00.000Z	JerKB	adrigen	if nothing else there's usually a README file
2006-06-07T10:54:00.000Z	adrigen	JerKB	sorry I missed your response if you gave one, but do you know what Im doing wrong by getting this:sudo dpkg -i Home/downloaded/ConsultComm-3.1.1.zip
2006-06-07T10:54:00.000Z	JerKB	adrigen	a zip file isn't installed with dpkg, only .debs
2006-06-07T10:55:00.000Z	JerKB	adrigen	unzip the file and look for a README or INSTALL that will probably tell you what you need to do.
2006-06-07T10:56:00.000Z	JerKB	adrigen	 or check with the program's website to see if there are any installations instructions.
2006-06-07T10:57:00.000Z	adrigen	JerKB	frustratingly the readme/faq doesnt have installation instructions nor does the website
2006-06-07T10:58:00.000Z	JerKB	adrigen	/msg me a link to the website where you got the program and I'll take a look
2006-06-07T11:01:00.000Z	adrigen	JerKB	there aren't any instructions but there are alternative downloads: an "RPM" and an "IzPack Installer" should I go for one of those?
2006-06-07T11:02:00.000Z	JerKB	adrigen	I'm looking at the website now.  You can try the .rpm but you'll have to use alien to convert it to a .deb
2006-06-07T11:03:00.000Z	adrigen	JerKB	is this pretty standard operation for installing stuff on linux?
2006-06-07T11:04:00.000Z	JerKB	adrigen	no, just some programs that aren't widely used aren't packaged in distros.
