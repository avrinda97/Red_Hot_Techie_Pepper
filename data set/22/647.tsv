2011-06-01T23:58:00.000Z	Cleofas		And it doesn't run from the bios.
2011-06-01T23:58:00.000Z	KM0201	Cleofas	if you've burned it that many times either 1. it's a bad ISO, download again, or 2. you're not burning correctly.
2011-06-01T23:59:00.000Z	Cleofas	KM0201	I downloaded it from the offcial site.
2011-06-01T23:59:00.000Z	KM0201	Cleofas	that doesn't really mean anything, but ok.
2011-06-01T23:59:00.000Z	Cleofas	KM0201	what do you mean?

2011-06-02T00:00:00.000Z	Cleofas		The image file is complete, I've burned it several times and it's not that you need to be an engineer to burn a cd.
2011-06-02T00:00:00.000Z	Cleofas	KM0201	I've seen it already.
