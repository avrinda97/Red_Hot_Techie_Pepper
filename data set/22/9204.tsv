2005-02-02T13:32:00.000Z	racoontje		hey
2005-02-02T13:32:00.000Z	racoontje		is it ok to use debian sources in ubuntu as well?
2005-02-02T13:33:00.000Z	racoontje		you see, ubuntu is a bit too spoonfed to me... but using ubuntu packages in debian breaks a lot because debian has archaic packages :-|
2005-02-02T13:33:00.000Z	Nafallo	racoontje	you don't HAVE to install ubuntu-meta packages...
2005-02-02T13:34:00.000Z	racoontje	Nafallo	you do if you want xorg...
2005-02-02T13:34:00.000Z	racoontje	Nafallo	oh wait
2005-02-02T13:34:00.000Z	Nafallo	racoontje	nope. you just install xorg. you don't have to install ubuntu-desktop ;-)
2005-02-02T13:34:00.000Z	racoontje	Nafallo	you were talking about how ubuntu can be consoleish?
2005-02-02T13:35:00.000Z	racoontje	Nafallo	can it? really? great!
2005-02-02T13:35:00.000Z	Nafallo	racoontje	nope, how you don't need it to be "spoonfeed" ;-)
2005-02-02T13:35:00.000Z	racoontje	Nafallo	if so, how about the package richness of the apt tree?
2005-02-02T13:35:00.000Z	racoontje	Nafallo	I use a lot of the science/math stuff
2005-02-02T13:36:00.000Z	Nafallo	racoontje	hoary tracks debian sid, so it shouldn't mather :-).
2005-02-02T13:36:00.000Z	racoontje		ok, so maybe I'll try ubuntu :-) where can I see the pkg'es?
2005-02-02T13:36:00.000Z	racoontje	Nafallo	has anyone told you guys you may want to find a new name? Hoary sounds wrong ;-)
2005-02-02T13:36:00.000Z	Nafallo	racoontje	hoary+1 is bendy :-P.
2005-02-02T13:37:00.000Z	Nafallo	racoontje	what's sounds most wrong? ;-)
2005-02-02T13:37:00.000Z	racoontje	Nafallo	how big is the apt repo of ubuntu compared to debian?
2005-02-02T13:38:00.000Z	Nafallo	racoontje	dunno really. you ask what packages from debian isn't in ubuntu for a specific arch?
2005-02-02T13:40:00.000Z	racoontje		is it possible to install ubuntu with the grey openbox & grey unthemed xdm I've grown to love? ;-)
2005-02-02T13:41:00.000Z	racoontje		ok thx
2005-02-02T13:41:00.000Z	Nafallo	racoontje	I haven't tried, but in theory; yes.
