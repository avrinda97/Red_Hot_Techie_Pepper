2008-12-06T12:55:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Cobalt	Yes, via udev-rules.
2008-12-06T12:56:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Cobalt	Oh, wait, and labels.
2008-12-06T12:56:00.000Z	Cobalt	zhaozhou	and that's possible without losing data on the said drive?
2008-12-06T12:56:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Cobalt	said?
2008-12-06T12:57:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Cobalt	oh wait
2008-12-06T12:57:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Cobalt	Yes, sure, just label it, it'll be fine.
2008-12-06T12:57:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Cobalt	or udev-rule it.
2008-12-06T12:57:00.000Z	Cobalt	zhaozhou	umm, is it possible to label the drives without losing information already stored on them?
2008-12-06T12:57:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Cobalt	Yes. :-) i think you have command named e2label or alike
2008-12-06T12:58:00.000Z	Cobalt	zhaozhou	udev-rule seemed a little too complex for what i wanted to do. i just want to assign a sane name to the drive/partition.
2008-12-06T12:58:00.000Z	Cobalt	zhaozhou	thanks, i'll look into that.
2008-12-06T12:59:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Cobalt	Well, it depends on where you want the name, really.
2008-12-06T12:59:00.000Z	Cobalt	zhaozhou	how do you mean?
2008-12-06T12:59:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Cobalt	If you label it you wont really be able to see the name in average days, it'll just be a label. You can look it up, but you wont see it.
2008-12-06T13:00:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Cobalt	If you udev-rule it you have a character device to use that's correctly named, but this does not matter when it's mounted anyway.
2008-12-06T13:00:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Cobalt	Lastly, you could mount it on a named point, but this will not be consistant.
2008-12-06T13:01:00.000Z	Cobalt	zhaozhou	the behaviour i was seeking was, when, for example, i mount an _ntfs_ partition, for example, it has the descriptive name i had on it before i switched to linux as the name that comes up in GNOME...
2008-12-06T13:02:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Cobalt	That's probably the label, yes.
2008-12-06T13:02:00.000Z	Cobalt	zhaozhou	ah, well, anyways, thanks, i'll google a bit on it and see what that turns up.
2008-12-06T13:03:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Cobalt	e2label. :-)
2008-12-06T13:03:00.000Z	Cobalt	zhaozhou	thanks again. :D
2008-12-06T13:03:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Cobalt	np. :-)
