2009-05-30T00:02:00.000Z	Dunge		I'm using ubuntu 8.04 on a vmware workstation winxp host, I'm trying to use a software that use the framebuffer. When starting it I get " Direct/Util: opening '/dev/fb0' and '/dev/fb/0' failed --> No such file or directory"... so how do I tell my ubuntu to have a framebuffer?
2009-05-30T00:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Dunge	load the apropiate fb driver ? or the vesa one ?
2009-05-30T00:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	Dunge	the vesa one should work on wevery card...
2009-05-30T00:05:00.000Z	Dunge	erUSUL	well I tried "modprobe vesafb"... it rebooted instantaneously xorg but it still dont work afterward
2009-05-30T00:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	Dunge	well fb + xorg at the same tie is not allways a good combination
2009-05-30T00:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	Dunge	fb is for VT consoles.
2009-05-30T00:08:00.000Z	Dunge	erUSUL	: you think I just kill xorg(ctrl+alt+backspace) then modprobe vesafb and /dev/fb0 should happens?
2009-05-30T00:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	Dunge	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2009-05-30T00:15:00.000Z	Dunge	erUSUL	: as I though, it don't works... vesafb is loading in the kernel modules but still no /dev/fb*
2009-05-30T00:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Dunge	then i dunno sorry :|
2009-05-30T00:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Dunge	what graphic card does vmware emulates ?
2009-05-30T00:19:00.000Z	Dunge	erUSUL	: don't know
2009-05-30T00:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Dunge	old-releases.ubuntu.com
2009-05-30T00:29:00.000Z	Dunge	erUSUL	: sorry for late response, but why are you giving me that link?
2009-05-30T00:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Dunge	was a mistake ; sorry.
2009-09-11T19:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	Dunge	vfat has weird "modes" to decide what it converts or not
2009-09-11T19:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	Dunge	see the mout man page the vfat section
2009-09-11T19:44:00.000Z	Dunge	erUSUL	: ok
2009-09-11T19:52:00.000Z	Dunge	erUSUL	: As I see, fat will always fuck up names if it's all in uppercase of all in lower case, wheter I use any shortname mode... that's crappy
2009-09-11T19:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	Dunge	the price for MS compatibility i guess
2009-09-11T19:54:00.000Z	Dunge	erUSUL	: When I create a file in windows all in uppercase, it don't transform it automatically on mount..
2009-09-11T19:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Dunge	dunno what to add. there is some reason i'm sure for this
