2007-04-13T10:30:00.000Z	jskulski		is anyone familiar with the rt61 driver? the driver is loaded ok, and i had entered the information in the network manager and iwconfig gives the right SSID and all that. iwpriv does not seem to want to change anything
2007-04-13T10:31:00.000Z	zero88	jskulski	do u get signal status?
2007-04-13T10:32:00.000Z	jskulski	zero88	 not sure how you test that, but dhclient wlan0 seems like its communicating something.
2007-04-13T10:33:00.000Z	zero88	jskulski	do you see the computer monitors in the top right? are they blinking at all?
2007-04-13T10:33:00.000Z	jskulski	zero88	 nothing on my bar
2007-04-13T10:35:00.000Z	zero88	jskulski	oh. go to system>admin>networking
2007-04-13T10:35:00.000Z	zero88	jskulski	under network settings.click on the dns tab
2007-04-13T10:37:00.000Z	jskulski	zero88	nothing in dns. dhclient wlan0 gives no DHCPOFFERS. in the rt61 faq, it says to use iwpriv but that doesn't seem to want to work either
2007-04-13T10:37:00.000Z	zero88	jskulski	is you wireless on eth1 eth0 or what?
2007-04-13T10:38:00.000Z	zero88	jskulski	try  sudo ifdown wlan0   then sudo ifup wlan0
2007-04-13T10:39:00.000Z	zero88	jskulski	hmmm.how did u load the drivers?
2007-04-13T10:39:00.000Z	jskulski	zero88	well I'm pretty sure tey were pre loaded. 6.10
2007-04-13T10:40:00.000Z	zero88	jskulski	hmmm.what does  ifconfig   show you.paste it in the pastebin
2007-04-13T10:41:00.000Z	zero88	jskulski	yes
2007-04-13T10:41:00.000Z	jskulski	zero88	oh maybe then its incomplete. let me try to install the drivers again
2007-04-13T10:42:00.000Z	zero88	jskulski	ok and in the network settings, did u see a wireless connection?
2007-04-13T10:42:00.000Z	jskulski	zero88	not a great way for me to paste (on a different non networked computer), anything you're interested in? wlan0 has a hwaddr and all
2007-04-13T10:42:00.000Z	jskulski	zero88	yeah there's two actually wlan0 and wmaster0. wlan0 has a hw addr and wmaster0 does not. but wmaster0 has nothing to offer in the iwpriv.
2007-04-13T10:44:00.000Z	jskulski	zero88	the guide i am working off of is from jan06 though. =\
2007-04-13T10:45:00.000Z	zero88	jskulski	hm could be out of date.but if you say the drivers are already preloaded for 6.10 you shouldnt have to load them.just type in the WEP esid and you should be good
2007-04-13T10:45:00.000Z	zero88	jskulski	so you configured the wireless connection?
2007-04-13T10:46:00.000Z	jskulski	zero88	 yeah through the network manager. it says in this guide that the drivers come with it but need the firmware, i'm gonna try that. even though its from 6.06
