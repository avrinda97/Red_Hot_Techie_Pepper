2011-04-21T04:21:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	No boot option? in grub?
2011-04-22T03:59:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	Had you installed Windows XP on that laptop before?
2011-04-22T04:00:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	Yeah, try removing the hdd
2011-04-22T04:01:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	Windows XP have lots of checking in hdd, which might cause a lot of problem
2011-04-22T04:01:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	hello
2011-04-22T04:02:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	Did you already checked your hdd in Disk Utility? Because you said before that it's acting strange
2011-04-22T04:04:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	Try clicking on the SMART Data button then check if there's a bad sector, try some self-test
2011-04-22T04:11:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	not sure, but select a hdd first in the left
2011-04-22T04:12:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	On the right of Format Drive?
2011-04-22T04:12:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	Below that is the SMART Data button
2011-04-22T04:13:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	Yeah, lots of changes in the UI. But it will still show healthy if the no. of bad sectors is below 100 (?)
2011-04-22T04:14:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	What are the buttons below the status of the hdd?
2011-04-22T04:14:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	It will be good if you could also check your RAM if it is not damaged, just to make sure
2011-04-22T04:15:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	Yes
2011-04-22T04:16:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	I think that more info holds the the info for the no. of bad sectors
2011-04-22T04:18:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	Maybe its not in the hdd, try RAM
2011-04-22T04:21:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	only hdd
2011-04-22T04:39:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	Then maybe that's the problem. You may also read some articles in the web for installing that OS, I don't have any experience with that laptop
2011-04-22T04:41:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	Yeah, I think it's good, my computer here is setup that way
2011-04-22T04:42:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	Not sure, but it seems its the same, but real ide is definitely slower
2011-04-22T04:44:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	dunno, but I used 64-bit before
2011-04-22T04:50:00.000Z	Galeon	KINGOFSWORDS	some do it overnight
