2009-10-09T10:18:00.000Z	cabaro	hd409	maybe enable remote connection on windows, then connect using tsclient, works for me
2009-10-09T10:19:00.000Z	cabaro	hd409	thats to connect to your ubuntu ssh with X enabled
2009-10-09T10:20:00.000Z	cabaro	hd409	connect to remote windows client, or what?
2009-10-09T10:20:00.000Z	hd409	cabaro	to access the teamviewer of my windows
2009-10-09T10:21:00.000Z	cabaro	hd409	ok, i'll google teamviewer.. one moment
2009-10-09T10:23:00.000Z	cabaro	hd409	if you don't want to forward RDC port, then vnc viewer would probably be easiest.
2009-10-09T10:25:00.000Z	hd409	cabaro	ill install vnc viewer here in my ubuntu 9.04?then install tightvnc server in windows?
2009-10-09T11:24:00.000Z	cabaro	hd409	is your windows client machine and linux client machine on same network? windows being the one you could connect from.
2009-10-09T11:27:00.000Z	hd409	cabaro	: yes the same network.i tried differenet network works well with win to win vnc even remote and local works like a charm.except ubuntu to win vnc
2009-10-09T11:29:00.000Z	cabaro	hd409	is there a reason why you don't use RDC connection?
