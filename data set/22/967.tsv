2010-12-23T07:07:00.000Z	doomcup_		My problem is I can see my windows box on the network
2010-12-23T07:07:00.000Z	doomcup_		But when I try to send something to the printer or access the shares it asks for authentication
2010-12-23T07:07:00.000Z	doomcup_		In a neverending loop
2010-12-23T07:07:00.000Z	doomcup_		It won't accept anything
2010-12-23T07:08:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	doomcup_	we've all had that problem!
2010-12-23T07:08:00.000Z	doomcup_	UnholyTerror	is there a way to fix it?
2010-12-23T07:08:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	doomcup_	did you set up the share on the windows side?
2010-12-23T07:08:00.000Z	doomcup_		Yes
2010-12-23T07:09:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	doomcup_	is the workgroup correct?
2010-12-23T07:09:00.000Z	doomcup_		Yes
2010-12-23T07:11:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	doomcup_	you could try uninstalling/reinstalling SAMBA...
2010-12-23T07:11:00.000Z	doomcup_		Tried that
2010-12-23T07:11:00.000Z	doomcup_		No dice
2010-12-23T07:12:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	doomcup_	I've never had a problem, never had to even touch a samba config file... sorry.
2010-12-23T07:14:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	doomcup_	/usr/share/doc/samba*
2010-12-23T07:15:00.000Z	doomcup_	UnholyTerror	what do I do here?
2010-12-23T07:16:00.000Z	UnholyTerror	doomcup_	read.
2010-12-23T07:16:00.000Z	doomcup_		Ah, RTFM
2010-12-23T07:16:00.000Z	doomcup_		How informative

2010-12-23T07:16:00.000Z	doomcup_		I'll ask somewhere else
