2008-08-16T05:35:00.000Z	Elijah		what does the [-r] in cp -r   do, i know it means recursive but I do not get it?
2008-08-16T05:35:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	recursive means it goes down all the sub folders and files
2008-08-16T05:46:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	not if the file or object is in that current folder
2008-08-16T05:47:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	where do you want to copy the html folder to?
2008-08-16T05:49:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	easiest and safest way: cp -rf /path/to/source/html   /path/to/destination-folder/html
2008-08-16T05:51:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	if the html folder is in the CURRENT directory you are in, you don't need the full path for the <FROM> part of the cp command
2008-08-16T05:52:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	/ is the path separator in linux. ie /home/elijah   means go to the home folder of the root directory(/) then go to the elijah folder inside the home directory
2008-08-16T05:53:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	no prob bob
2008-08-16T05:53:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	for the copy command? no.
2008-08-16T05:54:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	man cp :)  look at the options, it'll explain each one.
2008-08-16T05:56:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	the -rf means "force copy recursively"  if that makes sense to you. The man page will help you understand it better :)
2008-08-16T05:58:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	show me the command
2008-08-16T06:01:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	hang one
2008-08-16T06:02:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	does the /home/40151/.home/domains  folder exist?
2008-08-16T06:05:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	hang one..
2008-08-16T06:07:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	good. So you're set?
2008-08-16T06:08:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	are you familiar with DOS?
2008-08-16T06:10:00.000Z	Elijah	Slade	yeah, i have used command prompt in windows quite a few times, not sure if I used the actual dos program though
2008-08-16T06:11:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	same concept with linux. alot of dos commands are synonimus to linux commands...   cd = cd.  copy = cp  mv = move,  etc
2008-08-16T06:11:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	if you ever figure that out, make sure you let  me know :)
2008-08-16T07:07:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	tar zxvf <file name>
2008-08-16T07:15:00.000Z	Slade	Elijah	i prefer gzip
