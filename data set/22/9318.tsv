2005-03-25T06:09:00.000Z	binbrain	mdke	so for ppc you suggest not bleeding?
2005-03-25T06:09:00.000Z	mdke	binbrain	i would never recommend bleeding
2005-03-25T06:16:00.000Z	binbrain	mdke	sorry, /me going bleeding hoary
2005-03-25T06:16:00.000Z	mdke	binbrain	what is the reason?
2005-03-25T06:17:00.000Z	binbrain	mdke	stable is no fun
2005-03-25T06:17:00.000Z	mdke	binbrain	sure it is
2005-03-25T06:17:00.000Z	mdke	binbrain	unstable is not fun
