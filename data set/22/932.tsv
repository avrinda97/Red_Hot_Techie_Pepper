2011-07-24T02:01:00.000Z	linux_noob		ok, i have an x800 ati card, i have no clue how to install xf86.conf to make the card work, i have found out flgrx does not support it anymore
2011-07-24T02:01:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	linux_noob	have you tried to install the ATI drivers yet through "Additional Drivers" program?
2011-07-24T02:03:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	linux_noob	HAVE you installed the drivers or is that what you're asking? I don't exactly know what xff86.conf is so that's why I'm aksing.
2011-07-24T02:05:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	linux_noob	what do you mean you downloaded it from x.org?  don't you have to install the drivers from ATI's website?
2011-07-24T02:06:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	linux_noob	which version of ubuntu do you have?
2011-07-24T02:08:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	linux_noob	how did you download the unsupported drivers from amd? I reason that the supported ones are easy to get...

2011-07-24T02:25:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	linux_noob	yeah linux just doesn't have the market share that windoz has, so ATI doesn't really care as much... so is ur card supported?
2011-07-24T02:25:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	linux_noob	what's ur card again?
2011-07-24T02:29:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	linux_noob	sudo apt-get install glxinfo
2011-07-24T02:46:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	linux_noob	somehwere I heard they were better supported than ATI, but not too sure... I haven't really had any probs with my comps yet
2011-07-24T02:47:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	linux_noob	I personally like NVidia better though. never had a problem with them
