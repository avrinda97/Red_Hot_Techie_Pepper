2009-12-02T10:17:00.000Z	kanhaiya_kk		hi all, i am using ubuntu. i tried to install ubuntu karmic in new partition. After installation i found that, sda5 partition which was also ubuntu partition get converted into lost+found, for ex(#2679148 etc)
2009-12-02T10:18:00.000Z	Billiard	kanhaiya_kk	all partitions will have a lost+found directory on them
2009-12-02T14:02:00.000Z	Billiard	kanhaiya_kk	what do you mean its converted into lost+found
2009-12-02T14:03:00.000Z	Billiard	kanhaiya_kk	all partitions have a lost+found directory
2009-12-02T14:03:00.000Z	kanhaiya_kk	Billiard	that partition now contains only lost+found directory
2009-12-02T14:03:00.000Z	Billiard	kanhaiya_kk	you formated it then, its empty
2009-12-02T14:04:00.000Z	kanhaiya_kk	Billiard	df -h shows  that it contains data of 30GB
2009-12-02T14:05:00.000Z	Billiard	kanhaiya_kk	could try fsck on it
2009-12-02T14:06:00.000Z	kanhaiya_kk	Billiard	fsck is giving output clean /dev/sda5
2009-12-02T14:09:00.000Z	kanhaiya_kk	Billiard	you there ?
2009-12-02T14:10:00.000Z	Billiard	kanhaiya_kk	yeah
2009-12-02T14:11:00.000Z	kanhaiya_kk	Billiard	fsck is giving output clean /dev/sda5
2009-12-02T14:12:00.000Z	Billiard	kanhaiya_kk	i think files get moved to lost+found when the filesystem gets messed up
2009-12-02T14:13:00.000Z	kanhaiya_kk	Billiard	may be
2009-12-02T14:13:00.000Z	kanhaiya_kk	Billiard	so is there any method to restore that ?
2009-12-02T14:14:00.000Z	kanhaiya_kk	Billiard	basically im concerned about data.
2009-12-02T14:14:00.000Z	Billiard	kanhaiya_kk	find the files in the lost+found dir ?
2009-12-02T14:16:00.000Z	kanhaiya_kk	Billiard	that directory is hsowing hundreds of files like #34545, #2343 etc
2009-12-02T14:17:00.000Z	Billiard	kanhaiya_kk	yup
2009-12-02T14:18:00.000Z	kanhaiya_kk	Billiard	do you have any idea ?
2009-12-02T14:18:00.000Z	Billiard	kanhaiya_kk	of what?
2009-12-02T14:20:00.000Z	Billiard	kanhaiya_kk	some files may be fine, but maybe not
