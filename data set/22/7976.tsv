2006-05-22T15:08:00.000Z	bobslaede		ey, i got a amd64 cpu, is it just me, or is the repository not as huge, as with a normal 32 bit cpu - course with the breezy 64bit
2006-05-22T15:09:00.000Z	bobslaede		when dapper comes out, what is the bennefit of installing the 64bit version, and not the 32bit, when i have to hack around alot with the 64bit
2006-05-22T15:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobslaede	you don't, really, unless you're in desperate need of flash and/or wmv9
2006-05-22T15:11:00.000Z	bobslaede	apokryphos	well, i do like flash, and use it on the web, and in my work and wmv9 too i spose
2006-05-22T15:12:00.000Z	bobslaede	apokryphos	how about the speed of the computer, how much do i loose by using the 32bit version?
2006-05-22T15:12:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobslaede	then you can either have a 32bit chroot, 32bit install, or a BiArch supporting distro :P
2006-05-22T15:13:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobslaede	no idea of percentages, but if you're only using 32bit libs then there's really not much difference to having had a 32-bit processor
2006-05-22T15:13:00.000Z	bobslaede	apokryphos	i think i have the 32bit firefox
2006-05-22T15:13:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobslaede	suffice it to say I think it's certainly worth it :P
2006-05-22T15:13:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobslaede	huh?
2006-05-22T15:13:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobslaede	not on your amd64 ubuntu, unless it's in chroot
2006-05-22T15:14:00.000Z	bobslaede	apokryphos	dunno :p but i think maybe most of my libs and apps are 32bit
2006-05-22T15:14:00.000Z	bobslaede	apokryphos	maybe not then :p
2006-05-22T15:14:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobslaede	if you had a 32bit install they would be
2006-05-22T15:14:00.000Z	bobslaede	apokryphos	i have a 64bit install
2006-05-22T15:15:00.000Z	bobslaede	apokryphos	so a 32bit install would work just as good then? well, i wouldnt feel the different?
2006-05-22T15:16:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobslaede	obviously not. You wouldn't really be using the fact that it's a *64-bit processor*
2006-05-22T15:16:00.000Z	bobslaede	apokryphos	but i dont really *need* 64bit on my workstation?
2006-05-22T15:17:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobslaede	it can run a 32bit installation just fine, yes. It just wouldn't get all the advantages of a 64bit install
2006-05-22T15:18:00.000Z	bobslaede	apokryphos	but theres still disadvantages i spose, when i need everyday stuff like flash, and i had some problems with firefox in the beginning
2006-05-22T15:18:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobslaede	yes, on a pure ubuntu 64bint installation, there's no flash. Ubuntu isn't BiArch
2006-05-22T15:19:00.000Z	bobslaede	apokryphos	yeah... but what are the advantages then?
