2008-06-05T05:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NewfieLinux	You can then format or just use your olf windows partition for data
2008-06-05T05:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NewfieLinux	It will see your windows install and offer to shrink the partition and setup dual boot
2008-06-06T03:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NewfieLinux	lspci lsusb  or lshw
2008-06-06T03:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NewfieLinux	 if you do "sudo lshw -C network" what is the card/chipset?
