2007-03-04T15:10:00.000Z	khaije	ghatak	do you have the appropriate drivers activated?
2007-03-04T15:11:00.000Z	ghatak	khaije	yes the drivers are correct,
2007-03-04T15:11:00.000Z	ghatak		let me paste the Xorg.log output in pastebin
2007-03-04T15:13:00.000Z	ghatak	khaije	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8514/
2007-03-04T15:16:00.000Z	khaije	ghatak	checking it out now
2007-03-04T15:21:00.000Z	khaije	ghatak	can you pastebin the result of the glxinfo command? also have you edited xorg.conf manually and did you get the driver from repo's or website?
2007-03-04T15:28:00.000Z	ghatak		any luck with that glx error mate ?
2007-03-04T15:29:00.000Z	ghatak	khaije	any luck mate ?
2007-03-04T15:30:00.000Z	khaije	ghatak	did you post answers to the questions i asked? i didn't see it...
2007-03-04T15:43:00.000Z	ghatak		 khaije:  i got dc'ed, sorry i did not see it. apologies
2007-03-04T15:44:00.000Z	khaije	ghatak	i just asked if you could pastebin the output to 'glxinfo' and how you installed the drivers
2007-03-04T15:46:00.000Z	ghatak	khaije	right, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8515/, i installed the drivers using the article on ubuntu site for nvidia binary driver. I would mention that i had a driver before this which i downloaded from nvidia site and it was giving me grief.
2007-03-04T15:48:00.000Z	ghatak	khaije	i also found that symlink libGLcore.so.1 was pointing to the old driver /usr/lib/libGLcore.so.1.0.9631 while there is another one now which is /usr/lib/libGLcore.so.1.0.8774 , i am changed the symlink and X has come up, but the resolution is weired, it only now shows 1024x768 as max
2007-03-04T15:49:00.000Z	ghatak	khaije	the resolution with /usr/lib/libGLcore.so.1.0.9631 is ok, but glx wont load
2007-03-04T15:53:00.000Z	ghatak	khaije	i hope you got all that info ?
2007-03-04T16:22:00.000Z	ghatak		 X is not loading GLX extension, my card is NVidia GForce4 440MX, see glx failing in Xorg.log >>

2007-03-04T16:23:00.000Z	ghatak		please help
2007-03-04T16:37:00.000Z	khaije	ghatak	i would reccomend (1)using the repo'd nvidia blobs instead of any other ones for simplicity and ease , also (2) purge and reinstall the xserver-xorg-core package , and (3) dist-upgrade if you haven't done that lately
2007-03-04T16:39:00.000Z	ghatak	khaije	right, trying that now
2007-03-04T16:40:00.000Z	khaije	ghatak	sorry my comp is slow and a little overloaded atm
