2009-10-23T13:17:00.000Z	CHESLYN		hi everyone
2009-10-23T13:17:00.000Z	CHESLYN		can ubuntu catch a virus?]
2009-10-23T13:18:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 anything is possible...but  probably unlikely
2009-10-23T13:19:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 however you can google  clamav  viruses ... they do have a virus report tools  and most likely a list of known viruses
2009-10-23T13:21:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 two of my nephews actually caught a virus on their systems but both were servers and its likely they didnt set them up properly
2009-10-23T13:30:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 is is very unlikely you have one
2009-10-23T13:30:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 what is happening with it that you suspedt a virus?
2009-10-23T13:33:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 ah I see  mm...well clamav might be able to to help  perhpas  rkhunter  maybe
2009-10-23T13:41:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 you mean can a system survive a fan that is not working?
2009-10-23T13:42:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 a pentium  can survive an amd will die  so the answer is no it will not run for long and certainly wont last
2009-10-23T13:44:00.000Z	CHESLYN	coz_	no because i had a pentium that runs with out a fan on the CPU
2009-10-23T13:47:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 no I am saying the pentium can likely survive a broken fan for a short period of time
2009-10-23T13:47:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 and amd processor will likely burn up
2009-10-23T13:48:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 also an cpu without a fan that is working can...with the heat buildup...burn up other chips on the board
2009-10-23T13:51:00.000Z	CHESLYN	coz_	can you maybe say how long approximately does it take to burn the chip?
2009-10-23T13:51:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 depends on the cpu and how long you run it without a fan
2009-10-23T13:52:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 you are running the risk of overheating the    system and motherboard  exposing other chips to overheating and likely burning up
2009-10-23T13:53:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 although this is not a hardware troubleshooting  channel ....if the fan is not working...shut down the system...take out the fan.... get a bowl  deep enough to cover the fan   fill it wil alcohol and switch the fan around...there is a slight chance it is just dirty
2009-10-23T13:53:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 just be sure the fan is completely dry before turning on the system,
2009-10-23T13:57:00.000Z	CHESLYN	coz_	you know what ? i had a pentium that was running with a broken fan for mouths now im not sure whats happening
2009-10-23T13:58:00.000Z	coz_	CHESLYN	 mm  well I suggest cleaning or replacing the fan
2009-10-23T13:59:00.000Z	CHESLYN	coz_	but i think it can still go for mouths or years like this ....mm wow ne
