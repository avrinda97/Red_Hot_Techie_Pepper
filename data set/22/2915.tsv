2009-01-25T20:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	iamarockstar	if vista is sharing the connection i'd ask in ##windows
2009-01-25T20:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	iamarockstar	if the windows system is configured it will kick out dhcp. if not you can set the ubuntu systems on static ip to accommodate the new setup
2009-01-25T20:36:00.000Z	iamarockstar	ActionParsnip1	what do u mean by windows sys is configured?pls help me
2009-01-25T20:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	iamarockstar	if the windows system ics also includes a dhcp server then the linux systems will get dhcp automatically
2009-01-25T20:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	iamarockstar	if not you will have to setup static ip
2009-01-25T20:38:00.000Z	iamarockstar	ActionParsnip1	so does vista businness edition have ics with dhcp?
2009-01-25T20:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	iamarockstar	i dunno
2009-01-25T20:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	iamarockstar	just make sure the shared connection has a different network address as between the vista system and your adsl connection thingy
2009-01-25T20:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	iamarockstar	you need to setup 2 networks essentially
2009-01-25T20:42:00.000Z	iamarockstar	ActionParsnip1	u mean one nw on vista and one on ubuntu?
2009-01-25T20:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	iamarockstar	if you connect to a router giving the usual 192.168.0.x ip then setup the other network to use 192.168.2.x
2009-01-25T20:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	iamarockstar	the vista one, you have 2 networks, the one between the connection and the vista box, then one between vista and the linux boxes
2009-01-25T20:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	iamarockstar	if you dont have the networks seperated, it won't work
2009-01-25T20:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	iamarockstar	the ics factoid may help
