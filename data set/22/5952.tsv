2007-02-10T08:50:00.000Z	ivx		did anyone ever know they had www.google.com/linux
2007-02-10T08:50:00.000Z	unop	ivx	 thats been around for some 3-4 years now
2007-02-10T08:52:00.000Z	unop	ivx	 its to search for linux related webpages -- it narrows down the search so that you don't get windows or other specific results
2007-02-10T08:52:00.000Z	ivx	unop	oh cool. i stubled across it when i was looking at google.com on archive.org
2008-08-29T04:15:00.000Z	unop	ivx	is the shared folder a local directory or a network share?
2008-08-29T04:15:00.000Z	ivx	unop	local dir, I just have one computer,
2008-08-29T04:17:00.000Z	unop	ivx	put both users in a common group .. make that group owner of the directory and mount it under your home directories (see the --bind option to mount for that)
2008-08-29T04:17:00.000Z	unop	ivx	you might also like to chmod g+s /that/directory to make life a little easier
2008-08-29T04:26:00.000Z	ivx	unop	thanks
2008-08-29T05:07:00.000Z	unop	ivx	do you create files using nautilus?
2008-08-29T05:07:00.000Z	ivx	unop	yes i'm testing it right clicking and create file
2008-08-29T05:09:00.000Z	ivx	unop	I tried what you said to do before, but i'm having a sharing problem, would you suggest using NFS to share files?
2008-08-29T05:09:00.000Z	ivx	unop	for just one computer?
2008-08-29T05:10:00.000Z	unop	ivx	no NFS is overkill -- the problem is not how you have setup the share .. just the way nautilus creates files, it does not obey the umask .. so it's hard to create files/directories with the right permissions
2008-08-29T05:11:00.000Z	ivx	unop	but if i was creating a file with lets say gimp would that be the correct permissions? i set the folder to g+s
2008-08-29T05:11:00.000Z	unop	ivx	 you could modify the umask in /etc/profile to  umask 002  .. that will ensure nautilus creates file properly .. but it will still struggle with directories
2008-08-29T05:12:00.000Z	unop	ivx	yea, i'm not sure .. but i am pretty sure that even gimp is affected by this bug
2008-08-29T05:13:00.000Z	ivx	unop	so how fast do they usually fix bugs?
2008-08-29T05:14:00.000Z	unop	ivx	well, hard to say -- depends on the priority assigned to bugs .. and this one is classified as a 'low priority' one .. there's no telling, a couple of weeks perhaps
2008-08-29T05:15:00.000Z	ivx	unop	oh, well thanks for your help
2008-08-29T05:15:00.000Z	unop	ivx	this might be a workaround in the time being .. see the last post here. http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-40617.html
2008-08-29T05:17:00.000Z	ivx	unop	thanks
