2006-12-13T10:31:00.000Z	yoshig3		Can someone help me wiht a graphics problem please?
2006-12-13T10:32:00.000Z	yoshig3		I'm getting extremely crappy graphics performance on a GeForce4 MX 4000 PCI with the beta drivers, and I've tried all of the drivers except for 9X31.
2006-12-13T10:32:00.000Z	yoshig3		Anyone have any ideas?
2006-12-13T10:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	yoshig3	have you actually stated your problem?
2006-12-13T10:33:00.000Z	yoshig3	thoreauputic	yes I have.
2006-12-13T15:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	yoshig3	complaining about Ubuntu in an Ubuntu channel isn't likely to win you a lot of friends :)
2006-12-13T15:21:00.000Z	yoshig3	thoreauputic	You weren't here for the whole conversation
2006-12-13T15:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	yoshig3	especially when you are really complaining  about proprietary drivers, apparently
2006-12-13T15:22:00.000Z	yoshig3	thoreauputic	Don't try to put me down right now, I'm not in the mood for it.
2006-12-13T15:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	yoshig3	I'm not trying to put you down - i ubderstand that this is frustrating
2006-12-13T15:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	yoshig3	have a nice life :)
2006-12-13T15:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	yoshig3	OK - we got the point - see you whenever
2006-12-13T15:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	yoshig3	if you aren't happy no-one is forcing you to stay with ubuntu
2006-12-13T15:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	yoshig3	this is getting close to trolling, sorry
2006-12-13T15:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	yoshig3	please stop or I will have to ask you to leave - stay on topic or go
2006-12-13T15:32:00.000Z	yoshig3	thoreauputic	I completely understand, it probably sounds like I'm trying to put ubuntu down, but I'm really not. I really do like it, it just doesn't work for me
2006-12-13T15:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	yoshig3	OK - just stay on topic, please
2006-12-13T16:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	yoshig3	actually you can do almost anything without X ( mail, copy files etc etc and even look at pictures)
2006-12-13T16:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	yoshig3	there are limits of course :)
