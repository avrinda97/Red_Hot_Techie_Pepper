2008-10-23T09:28:00.000Z	Sammy		question.. can we install oracle in ubutu. thats posible??
2008-10-23T09:28:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	Probably.  Google for install or see if someone knows specifically.
2008-10-23T09:28:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	My general understanding is that Oracle's actually working specificaly with Ubuntu though they may target specific LTS releases.
2008-10-23T09:32:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	as user or root?
2008-10-23T09:33:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	As user:  'crontab'.  As root:  edit /etc/crontab, or better, /etc/cron.d/<file>
2008-10-23T09:33:00.000Z	Sammy	karsten	i'm root
2008-10-23T09:34:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	Root also has its own user corontab (maintained with the 'crontab' command and installed in /var/spool/cron/ (I think), but Don't Use That in general.
2008-10-23T10:13:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	cornd.pid is a file that contains the PID (process ID) of the currently running cron daemon.  Sometimes the file hangs around after cron has died.  What's the error message?
2008-10-23T10:15:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	What are you trying to run?  What do you want to have happen and when?
2008-10-23T10:15:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	My suggestion would be to look at /etc/crontab, /etc/cron.d/, and/or /etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}
2008-10-23T10:16:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	As a user?
2008-10-23T10:16:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	... as opposed to by root?
2008-10-23T10:16:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	'crontab'
2008-10-23T10:16:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	man 5 crontab will give you the file format.
2008-10-23T10:17:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	<minute> <hour> <day of month> <month> <day of week> <command>

2008-10-23T10:48:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	What are you trying?  What error doe you get?

2008-10-23T10:50:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	So I gathered.  Please provide the command used and error message received.  Pastebin these.
2008-10-23T10:51:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	Run an update.
2008-10-23T10:51:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	.. and retry.  Ensure you don't have any networking issues.
2008-10-23T10:52:00.000Z	karsten	Sammy	If you haven't updated package lists and the package file has been removed you'll get that message.
