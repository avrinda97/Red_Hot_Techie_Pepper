2011-05-23T02:13:00.000Z	peterhil		The Win 7 requirements are RIDICULOUS!
2011-05-23T02:14:00.000Z	peterhil		16 Gb of HD and 1 GB RAM
2011-05-23T02:14:00.000Z	peterhil		WTF?
2011-05-23T02:14:00.000Z	sudokill	peterhil	whats wrong
2011-05-23T02:14:00.000Z	sudokill	peterhil	Win 7 should run on any pc
2011-05-23T02:17:00.000Z	sudokill	peterhil	why use windows 7 just for web browsing? why not use ubuntu
2011-05-23T02:18:00.000Z	sudokill	peterhil	it should run ok 512 is minimum ur CPU is slow though
2011-05-23T02:18:00.000Z	peterhil	sudokill	I'm installing this machine for a friend's dad. I asked the same question and said Gnome 3 IS easier than Win7, but the friend still wants win
2011-05-23T02:19:00.000Z	sudokill	peterhil	what exactly is the problem ur having?
2011-05-23T02:19:00.000Z	sudokill	peterhil	wont it install at all?
2011-05-23T02:50:00.000Z	peterhil	sudokill	I just asked about should windows be installed before ubuntu on a dual boot setup or on a separate partition. Other than that, my problem is that I have to install the bloat that win7 is and waste disk space.
2011-05-23T02:50:00.000Z	sudokill	peterhil	if ur dual booting install windows first cos windows boot loader dont recognise linux
2011-05-23T02:51:00.000Z	sudokill	peterhil	its easier than having to redo grub etc
2011-05-23T02:51:00.000Z	peterhil	sudokill	Yes, escott and cablop told me that if I install Ubuntu first, I need to reinstall grub
2011-05-23T02:52:00.000Z	sudokill	peterhil	 easybcd is to configure boot options
2011-05-23T02:52:00.000Z	sudokill	peterhil	i think its only for windows dual boots not sure never used it
2011-05-23T02:53:00.000Z	sudokill	peterhil	windows doesnt recognise
2011-05-23T02:55:00.000Z	sudokill	peterhil	is the ext drive a data one? if not u dont need a driver you dont need to have access to it
2011-05-23T02:56:00.000Z	peterhil	sudokill	the ext partition that I thought might be shared, will be home
2011-05-23T02:57:00.000Z	sudokill	peterhil	ok
2011-05-23T02:58:00.000Z	sudokill	peterhil	i have no idea how reliable those drivers are
2011-05-23T02:59:00.000Z	peterhil	sudokill	If it doesn't work, then I resize the Win or /home to accomodate for a FAT32 parition
