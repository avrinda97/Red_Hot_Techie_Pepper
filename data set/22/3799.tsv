2008-08-18T09:25:00.000Z	Rhorse	Mecha25	and searching
2008-08-18T09:26:00.000Z	Mecha25	Rhorse	yes... I wish it wasn't so dang slow
2008-08-18T09:26:00.000Z	Rhorse	Mecha25	only on startup not once started; it's quick
2008-08-18T09:26:00.000Z	Mecha25	Rhorse	I'm using it... it's slow
2008-08-18T09:27:00.000Z	Mecha25	Rhorse	I'm on a 1.8GHZ single core
2008-08-18T09:27:00.000Z	Rhorse	Mecha25	similar here, 1.4 centrino.
2008-08-18T09:27:00.000Z	Rhorse	Mecha25	about 4000
2008-08-18T09:30:00.000Z	Rhorse	Mecha25	dunno. I like that it adds to your library cumulatively and ignores folders that arent mounted, and then uses them when it detects them
2008-08-18T09:30:00.000Z	Mecha25	Rhorse	when you sort your library, does it take a couple seconds for all the songs to be listed?
2008-08-18T09:31:00.000Z	Rhorse	Mecha25	sure, anytime the *whole* lib needs to be sorted, read, etc, it's a bit of a wait
2008-08-18T09:31:00.000Z	Mecha25	Rhorse	that's what I mean.  Banshee doesn't have that wait, same situation
2008-08-18T09:32:00.000Z	Rhorse	Mecha25	really? I would have thought that was just running out of cycles...
2008-08-18T09:32:00.000Z	Mecha25	Rhorse	it's because it's written in python
2008-08-18T09:32:00.000Z	Rhorse	Mecha25	true!
2008-08-18T09:33:00.000Z	Rhorse	Mecha25	but python is pretty quick
2008-08-18T09:33:00.000Z	Rhorse	Mecha25	 I haven't tried banshee yet
2008-08-18T09:34:00.000Z	Mecha25	Rhorse	no.  it's interpreted, an order of magnitude slower than C or C++, which are compiled
2008-08-18T09:34:00.000Z	Mecha25	Rhorse	http://banshee-project.org/
2008-08-18T09:34:00.000Z	Mecha25	Rhorse	get the new version, not the one in the repos
2008-08-18T09:35:00.000Z	Rhorse	Mecha25	tnx fer the reccomend
2008-08-18T09:35:00.000Z	Mecha25	Rhorse	it won't mass-tag-edit like Quod Libet can... but then again nothing does
2008-08-18T09:36:00.000Z	Rhorse	Mecha25	won't ex falso work with banshee?
