2009-03-01T12:28:00.000Z	vigo	livingdaylight	Use the Restore at boot, you can choose the previous kernel or whatever.
2009-03-01T12:29:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vigo	because i did upgrade from feisty all previous kernels are of the 8.10 variety
2009-03-01T12:30:00.000Z	vigo	livingdaylight	That is why every OS suggests that regular backups are made of stable installs. Ubuntu and others have a restore feature in the boot or grub that can help that.
2009-03-01T12:31:00.000Z	vigo	livingdaylight	Reboot. select the last stable kernel
2009-03-01T12:32:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vigo	thx, but as i said i tried your suggestion to no avail
2009-03-01T12:33:00.000Z	vigo	livingdaylight	I did the same thing, had to re-install once, once I used the restore, I do not know if that is still available after a kernel/distro upgrade.
2009-03-01T12:33:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vigo	apparently not
2009-11-04T18:34:00.000Z	vigo	livingdaylight	If you want to use or prefer Pidgin. use it, look at Debian.org or Launchpad for the reasoning why packages were are are removed/replaced.
2009-11-04T18:35:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vigo	that is why i am asking because i presume there was some rationale behind replacing a seemingly superior app, pidgin in this case, with and inferior one, and i don't want to mess my system up if there is such a rationale behind it
2009-11-04T18:38:00.000Z	vigo	livingdaylight	The explanation and reasoning for the removal from the Default Install is explained in detail at Launchpad.net and Debian.org. Yes, there was some reasoning to it being depreciated, but it still exists and you or anyone are free to choose what you prefer to use. I forget the actual reasoning, so I suggested that you look them up and decide for yourself.
2009-11-04T18:39:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vigo	can you give me a link to that to help me understand?
2009-11-04T18:40:00.000Z	vigo	livingdaylight	am on it now......
2009-11-04T18:40:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vigo	thank you :D
2009-11-04T18:43:00.000Z	vigo	livingdaylight	Here is one: http://packages.qa.debian.org/p/pidgin.html
2009-11-04T18:44:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vigo	thx aggain
2009-11-04T18:44:00.000Z	vigo	livingdaylight	You are very welcome.
