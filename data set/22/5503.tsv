2010-02-21T16:13:00.000Z	nameless`		i have an old ubuntu hardy that i cannot uninstall, but i have to install gtk 2.18 on it
2010-02-21T16:14:00.000Z	nameless`		i tried the hardy-backport but it's not the 2.18 version
2010-02-21T16:14:00.000Z	nameless`		how can i install gtk 2.18 on a ubuntu hardy LTS edition
2010-02-21T16:15:00.000Z	ardchoille	nameless`	that would likely require you to upgrade so many packages that it would no longer be ubuntu hardy
2010-02-21T16:16:00.000Z	ardchoille	nameless`	the next LTS release (Lucid) will be out in April
2010-02-21T16:18:00.000Z	nameless`	ardchoille	i don't care i need it very quick i'll do the transformation after
2010-02-21T16:18:00.000Z	nameless`	ardchoille	what do i have to do ? use the 9.10 sources.list ?
2010-02-21T16:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	nameless`	quick? It won't be quick at all, you're better off waiting for Lucid
2010-02-21T16:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	nameless`	using the 9,.10 sources list would trash your system
2010-02-21T16:19:00.000Z	nameless`	ardchoille	i can't and my update only focus on gtk 2.18
2010-02-21T16:20:00.000Z	nameless`	ardchoille	do you know the way to do it i don't care if i have to reinstall my system in a week
2010-02-21T16:20:00.000Z	nameless`	ardchoille	but i really need 2.18 right now :)
2010-02-21T16:20:00.000Z	ardchoille	nameless`	you cannot install 2.28 on Hardy in a quick manner and expect it to run correctly.
2010-02-21T16:20:00.000Z	nameless`	ardchoille	i think it's possible
2010-02-21T16:20:00.000Z	ardchoille	nameless`	Trsut me, it isn't
2010-02-21T16:20:00.000Z	nameless`	ardchoille	give me a reason
2010-02-21T16:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	nameless`	it's not possible to do what you want to do and having a working Hardy system. End of story
2010-02-21T16:21:00.000Z	nameless`	ardchoille	i DO not want to have a working hardy system
2010-02-21T16:21:00.000Z	nameless`	ardchoille	i said that
2010-02-21T16:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	nameless`	then simply upgrade
2010-02-21T16:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	nameless`	But it will no longer be HArdy LTS
