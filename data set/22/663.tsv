2011-07-12T04:29:00.000Z	Talaskina		anyone have any info on what encyption types are recoverable?
2011-07-12T04:30:00.000Z	sudokill	Talaskina	what do you mean
2011-07-12T04:32:00.000Z	Talaskina	sudokill	there are some encryption schemes out there, methods or types, that have a master key that can be recovered even without the right passphrase, specifically I am trying to find out what standards those are, like is AES effected, or twofish, or whatever. i would prefer to avoid them if possible :)
2011-07-12T04:32:00.000Z	sudokill		no idea
2011-07-12T04:33:00.000Z	sudokill		all i know is AES is generally fine and reliable and fast
2011-07-12T04:33:00.000Z	sudokill		i think youd be safe with plain aes
2011-07-12T04:33:00.000Z	Talaskina	sudokill	yes, but i am trying to find out if aes does have the recoverable part
2011-07-12T04:34:00.000Z	sudokill		everyone seems to be fully encrypting drives nowadays
2011-07-12T04:35:00.000Z	Talaskina	sudokill	its the best thing, tho i dont know how much longer it will last, DOJ is trying to force a woman to decrypt her drive
2011-07-12T04:35:00.000Z	sudokill		DOJ?
2011-07-12T04:35:00.000Z	Talaskina	sudokill	department of justice, america
2011-07-12T04:35:00.000Z	sudokill		i used to fully encrypt my drives years ago
2011-07-12T04:36:00.000Z	sudokill		but then i realised i dont need it lol
2011-07-12T04:36:00.000Z	sudokill	Talaskina	i dont know the laws in US. in the UK by law you have to reveal password
2011-07-12T04:37:00.000Z	sudokill		but if you havent got illegal stuff, just your bank details etc then dont see what you got to worry about with the government
2011-07-12T04:37:00.000Z	Talaskina	sudokill	i saw that, you could just forget it or, idk house the actual info out of country
2011-07-12T04:37:00.000Z	sudokill		i know
2011-07-12T04:37:00.000Z	sudokill		i dont know how it works because anyone could easily forget a long password
2011-07-12T04:39:00.000Z	Talaskina	sudokill	i never liked that analogy, I have data and i perfer it to be encrypted so no one can see, even if its nothing illegal, I wouldnt want random goverment people shuffling through my stuff just because they 'suspect' something,
2011-07-12T04:39:00.000Z	sudokill		meh i wouldnt care
2011-07-12T04:39:00.000Z	sudokill		i think the whole "privacy" thing is overkill nowadays
2011-07-12T04:39:00.000Z	Talaskina	sudokill	at this point its half principle, and half protection of private data.
