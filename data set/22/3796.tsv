2008-05-30T04:17:00.000Z	Ahadiel	HackOfChris	Using any addons?
2008-05-30T04:17:00.000Z	HackOfChris	Ahadiel	that's with no addons
2008-05-30T04:17:00.000Z	Ahadiel	HackOfChris	And where were you in WoW?
2008-05-30T04:18:00.000Z	HackOfChris	Ahadiel	I was in SW, but I moved out into Elwen Forest, and still same fps
2008-05-30T04:18:00.000Z	Ahadiel	HackOfChris	Hrm, what video card are you running?
2008-05-30T04:19:00.000Z	HackOfChris	Ahadiel	onboard, intel 945
2008-05-30T04:19:00.000Z	Ahadiel	HackOfChris	That's why. The Intel GMA945/50 is not meant for gaming.
2008-05-30T04:20:00.000Z	HackOfChris	Ahadiel	yeah, but I was expecting more, since I get about 400% more than that in windows
2008-05-30T04:20:00.000Z	Ahadiel	HackOfChris	Still, I wouldn't expect much from the Intel GMA945
2008-05-30T04:24:00.000Z	Ahadiel	HackOfChris	They won't =/
2008-05-30T04:25:00.000Z	HackOfChris	Ahadiel	i know, but they should
2008-05-30T04:25:00.000Z	HackOfChris	Ahadiel	LOL
2008-05-30T04:26:00.000Z	Ahadiel	HackOfChris	I can try it right now if you'd like.
2008-05-30T04:27:00.000Z	HackOfChris	Ahadiel	that would be kewl of ya
2008-05-30T04:31:00.000Z	Ahadiel	HackOfChris	Downloading iTunes as we speak.
2008-05-30T04:31:00.000Z	HackOfChris	Ahadiel	kewl
2008-05-30T04:31:00.000Z	HackOfChris	Ahadiel	If I have xp installed, shouldnt all of the software for vista run in XP atm?
2008-05-30T04:32:00.000Z	Ahadiel	HackOfChris	It depends? Some Windows software uses Vista specific API
2008-05-30T04:33:00.000Z	HackOfChris	Ahadiel	well, they are requiring vista, so i guess I need install vista....That sucks
2008-05-30T04:48:00.000Z	Ahadiel	HackOfChris	Itunes seems to work fine.
2008-05-30T04:48:00.000Z	Ahadiel	HackOfChris	In VirtualBox that is
2008-05-30T04:48:00.000Z	HackOfChris	Ahadiel	ok
