2006-05-27T16:57:00.000Z	DJ_Danni		?
2006-05-27T16:57:00.000Z	nickrud	DJ_Danni	what are you trying to do?
2006-05-27T16:58:00.000Z	nickrud	DJ_Danni	sudo apt-get install xine-ui to get xine. If you're a beginner in Linux, here's a hard and fast rule: never ever use .rpm in ubuntu
2006-05-29T10:31:00.000Z	nickrud	DJ_Danni	mplayer (according to gentoo) is supposed to play nsv , do you have a stream to test?
2006-05-29T10:33:00.000Z	nickrud	DJ_Danni	a sec, I have to reinstall mplayer (a side effect of the wvidal fiasco)
2006-05-29T10:34:00.000Z	nickrud	DJ_Danni	working here with mplayer
2006-05-29T10:36:00.000Z	nickrud	DJ_Danni	I think it's using the w32codecs to play that, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats for windows codecs,
2006-05-29T10:39:00.000Z	nickrud	DJ_Danni	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats see alternate media players & windows codecs

2006-05-29T11:28:00.000Z	nickrud	DJ_Danni	the best way to get those codecs for nsv is https://wiki.ubuntu.com//RestrictedFormats#head-16ea04e7e1ecd06555912ba3f470b56563cbd85d
2006-05-29T11:29:00.000Z	nickrud	DJ_Danni	they will extracted automatically to /usr/lib/win32 if you do those two steps
2007-08-25T09:03:00.000Z	nickrud	DJ_Danni	you can see what iptable rules are running with sudo iptables -L
2007-08-25T09:07:00.000Z	DJ_Danni	nickrud	are you there?
2007-08-26T08:05:00.000Z	nickrud	DJ_Danni	sudo iptables -F will flush all the current rules
2007-08-26T08:06:00.000Z	nickrud	DJ_Danni	then sudo iptables -L will list the active ones
