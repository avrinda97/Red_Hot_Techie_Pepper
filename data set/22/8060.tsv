2005-10-24T14:04:00.000Z	KenSentMe1		where can i find the .skype file?
2005-10-24T14:05:00.000Z	KenSentMe1		it hasn't worked btw
2005-10-24T14:05:00.000Z	Jowi	KenSentMe1	/home/username/.Skype (it's a capital S in .Skype)
2005-10-24T14:09:00.000Z	KenSentMe1	Jowi	the problem is the fill in field in Skype
2005-10-24T14:10:00.000Z	Jowi	KenSentMe1	all your settings will disappear, but it is worth a shot to delete the .Skype directory. 'rm -rf /home/username/.Skype'
2005-10-24T14:12:00.000Z	KenSentMe1	Jowi	the password field won't take the 7th and 8th char, both being a non-numerical
2005-10-24T14:12:00.000Z	KenSentMe1	Jowi	like & and %
2005-10-24T14:13:00.000Z	KenSentMe1	Jowi	could this be because i'm on a laptop?
2005-10-24T14:13:00.000Z	Jowi	KenSentMe1	oh, i never heard of that problem...
2005-10-24T14:14:00.000Z	KenSentMe1	Jowi	me neither
2005-10-24T14:14:00.000Z	Jowi	KenSentMe1	i mean, all the % and stuff work everywhere else
2005-10-24T14:14:00.000Z	KenSentMe1	Jowi	i can't even paste the password in the field, can you?
2005-10-24T14:14:00.000Z	Jowi	KenSentMe1	will check. wait
2005-10-24T14:14:00.000Z	KenSentMe1	Jowi	k
2005-10-24T14:15:00.000Z	Jowi	KenSentMe1	yep, i can paste my password
2005-10-24T14:16:00.000Z	Jowi	KenSentMe1	maybe you should try to remove and install skype again
2005-10-24T14:27:00.000Z	KenSentMe1	Jowi	i reinstalled, but it doesn't work
2005-10-24T14:28:00.000Z	Jowi	KenSentMe1	ouch. that's the weirdest thing i ever heard of.
2005-10-24T14:29:00.000Z	KenSentMe1	Jowi	how did you install Skype?
2005-10-24T14:29:00.000Z	KenSentMe1	Jowi	i've installe through the SkypeHowTo from the ubuntu wiki
2005-10-24T14:29:00.000Z	Jowi	KenSentMe1	i think it may be that your password contain % and stuff. change your password at skype.com to a somewhat normal one might help.
2005-10-24T14:31:00.000Z	Jowi	KenSentMe1	there is only one way to install skype. sudo dpkg -i skype.deb
