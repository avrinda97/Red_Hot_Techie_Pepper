2010-07-14T12:59:00.000Z	bj0ng0		ffs how is this even possible, running rfcomm connect in terminal myself just connected me to the bluetooht device, running it from a script at login, breaks bluetooth, restart/shutdown, and now after a reboot bluetooth icon is gray, but still says that BT is on hehe blargh time for another reinstall, or just another dist  ;(
2010-07-14T12:59:00.000Z	tech2077	bj0ng0	the startup breaks it since it is a user based program
2010-07-14T13:00:00.000Z	bj0ng0	tech2077	 heh whatnow? ;)
2010-07-14T13:01:00.000Z	tech2077	bj0ng0	put it under startup applications, thats starts on login
2010-07-14T13:01:00.000Z	bj0ng0	tech2077	 thats what i did  ;)
2010-07-14T13:01:00.000Z	tech2077	bj0ng0	then make it wait until bluetooth daemon is on
2010-07-14T13:02:00.000Z	bj0ng0	tech2077	 well BT isnt working at all now, so even if i could make it wait... x)
2010-07-14T13:02:00.000Z	tech2077	bj0ng0	it's broken even after restart
2010-07-14T13:02:00.000Z	bj0ng0	tech2077	 yes  ;(
2010-07-14T13:03:00.000Z	tech2077	bj0ng0	even after reinstall :(
2010-07-14T13:03:00.000Z	bj0ng0	tech2077	 no, after i reinstalled ubuntu, everything worked fine, until i wanted it to autoconnect to GPS heh
2010-07-14T13:04:00.000Z	tech2077	bj0ng0	there is a option i think for autoconnect on the icon gui thing for gnome-bluetooth
2010-07-14T13:05:00.000Z	bj0ng0	tech2077	 no there is not, some sites tells me to edit hci.conf or /default/bluetooth  but no such files, and some tells me to add my device to /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf  but no cigar! ;(
2010-07-14T13:06:00.000Z	tech2077	bj0ng0	sorry to head about that
2010-07-14T13:07:00.000Z	bj0ng0	tech2077	 nice, ill start on my reinstall  lol

2010-07-14T13:10:00.000Z	bj0ng0	tech2077	 heh i wish it was so simple, but there aint no /etc/default/bluetooth  x)
2010-07-14T13:10:00.000Z	tech2077	bj0ng0	just do the whole setup, from start to there
2010-07-14T13:11:00.000Z	bj0ng0	tech2077	 i have, everything works/worked  but not the autoconnect things, cus there are no files to edit  ;)
2010-07-14T13:11:00.000Z	tech2077	bj0ng0	type this in bash sudo apt-get install bluez && sudo apt-get install bluez-utils
2010-07-14T13:13:00.000Z	bj0ng0	tech2077	both are already the newest version   ;)
2010-07-14T13:14:00.000Z	tech2077	bj0ng0	can you do a pm, this is sorta bothersom with the huge text inbetween
