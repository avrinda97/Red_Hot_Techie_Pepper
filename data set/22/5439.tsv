2007-06-04T07:00:00.000Z	aa_		so, the dapper installer cannot find my SATA drive, suggestions?
2007-06-04T07:02:00.000Z	Gnea	aa_	you don't have a choice, you have to work on it now and then.
2007-06-04T07:02:00.000Z	aa_	Gnea	I don't understand
2007-06-04T07:03:00.000Z	Gnea	aa_	that's the problem.  software evolves, it gets better and better, that's just how it works. to demand that it remains static would cause everything to break and fall apart.
2007-06-04T07:04:00.000Z	aa_	Gnea	I don't need much improvement, I just need security fixes until 2011
2007-06-04T07:05:00.000Z	Gnea	aa_	you seem to have a problem with reality - you're either going to have to get with the program or the program will get with you.
2007-06-04T07:06:00.000Z	aa_	Gnea	I think you have the problem with reality, upgrading a server to a new operating system every six months is insanity
2007-06-04T07:06:00.000Z	Gnea	aa_	who does that?
2007-06-04T07:07:00.000Z	aa_	Gnea	but feisty will be depracated in 6 months
2007-06-04T07:07:00.000Z	aa_	Gnea	I won't be getting security updates. How awful
2007-06-04T07:07:00.000Z	Gnea	aa_	so keep up and fix it
2007-06-04T07:08:00.000Z	Gnea	aa_	i take it you aren't an administrator
2007-06-04T07:08:00.000Z	aa_	Gnea	now really, are you suggesting I fix a depracated OS instead of using dapper? now who is having trouble with reality?
2007-06-04T07:08:00.000Z	aa_	Gnea	only when I have to, I am a dev
2007-06-04T07:09:00.000Z	Gnea	aa_	okay, well then you should either learn how to admin a box or get someone to help you admin it
2007-06-04T07:09:00.000Z	aa_	Gnea	that is the whole point of using a long-term ubuntu release
2007-06-04T07:10:00.000Z	aa_	Gnea	actually, I am adebian user for 7nearly 10 years, I'll just use debian stable
2007-06-04T07:10:00.000Z	Gnea	aa_	good idea, etch is pretty good, and you can just s/etch/stable/g and it'll catch the upgrades on its own.
2007-06-04T07:11:00.000Z	Gnea	aa_	i've been using debian for a decade as well.
2007-06-04T07:11:00.000Z	aa_	Gnea	then you see why I want to use dapper, not feisty :)
2007-06-04T07:13:00.000Z	Gnea	aa_	doesn't make a difference to me, the point is that you require a solution that is guaranteed to flat-line you in 4 years, not 2.  if running debian stable makes it work, then go for it.  i don't care why you want to run dapper. :)
2007-06-04T07:14:00.000Z	aa_	Gnea	right well, feisty won't flat line me for another 6 months
