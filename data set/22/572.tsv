2011-12-13T04:17:00.000Z	Escherial		hey, why are all the backgrounds on eclipse tooltips black after upgrading to 11.10?
2011-12-13T04:17:00.000Z	forceflow	Escherial	are you sure you're running eclipse with Sun's Java
2011-12-13T04:17:00.000Z	Escherial		er, or more helpfully, how would i go about changing them? :)
2011-12-13T04:17:00.000Z	forceflow		and nog GCJ (open source java)
2011-12-13T04:17:00.000Z	forceflow		sorry, GJC I think that is
2011-12-13T04:18:00.000Z	forceflow	Escherial	check set-alternatives java
2011-12-13T04:18:00.000Z	Escherial	forceflow	you're right, i'm using openjdk
2011-12-13T04:19:00.000Z	forceflow	Escherial	you better change to SUN jdk if you want eclipse to display properly, I'm afraid
2011-12-13T04:19:00.000Z	forceflow		I think that's the problem
2011-12-13T04:19:00.000Z	Escherial		strange that this should've changed between 11.04 and 11.10
2011-12-13T04:19:00.000Z	forceflow	Escherial	eclipse updated too ...
2011-12-13T04:19:00.000Z	forceflow	Escherial	other thing to try: switch to non-accelerated desktop (ubuntu 2D, or simple, or whatever it's called nowadays :) )
2011-12-13T04:19:00.000Z	Escherial		the tooltips display properly, just with a black background; is there perhaps a way to change the system-wide tooltip background color?
2011-12-13T04:21:00.000Z	Escherial	forceflow	actually, argh, just changing the theme from "radiance" to something else improved the situation dramatically (light-blue background instead of black)
2011-12-13T04:21:00.000Z	Escherial		i may change over to sun's jvm if i encounter problems, but it seems like openjdk is working well enough for now
2011-12-13T04:22:00.000Z	forceflow	Escherial	strange ... well, glad it helped
2011-12-13T04:22:00.000Z	forceflow	Escherial	are you running eclipse from the repos or the latest version from site?
2011-12-13T04:22:00.000Z	Escherial		from the repos, i believe
2011-12-13T04:22:00.000Z	forceflow		Might be interesting to download the latest version (it's just unzipping to a folder and running it) to check
2011-12-13T04:23:00.000Z	forceflow		As long as you select a different workspace folder, it won't interfere with the other eclipse(s) you have running :)
2011-12-13T04:25:00.000Z	Escherial	forceflow	interesting idea, i'll try it when i get a moment :) thanks for the help, by the way
2011-12-13T04:26:00.000Z	forceflow	Escherial	no problem
