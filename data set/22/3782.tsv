2008-06-14T06:41:00.000Z	Leefmc		Where do you manually install things in Ubuntu? Ie, Blender, GoogleAppEngine server, etc?
2008-06-14T06:42:00.000Z	ubunubi	Leefmc	Depends on the program. If it's in a repository, use Synaptic...if it's source code, gotta compile it. if it's a deb package, gotta download it, open it and install it
2008-06-14T06:42:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	^^
2008-06-14T06:43:00.000Z	ubunubi	Leefmc	thanks ;)
2008-06-14T06:43:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	So, what if its none of those 3?
2008-06-14T06:43:00.000Z	ubunubi	Leefmc	Could you be more specific? What format IS it in?
2008-06-14T06:44:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	^^
2008-06-14T06:45:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	Blender comes as a .. tar, heh. No installer of any form, it runs out of the directory you unzip it to.
2008-06-14T06:45:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	And the google app i'm talking about seems to be similar, except its specifically having to do with python.
2008-06-14T06:46:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	Well i mean, so there is no .. standard? Ubuntu just wants you to shove crap where ever? Seems odd. heh
2008-06-14T06:47:00.000Z	ubunubi	Leefmc	For a program to support to Ubuntu "standard"....it has to be packaged as a *deb file, or a deb file in a repository. that's the purpose of the deb file, is to tell everything where to get stored, so that it does it the "ubuntu-way"
2008-06-14T06:47:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	Yea, but im asking how do _i_ do it the "ubuntu way" :o
2008-06-14T06:49:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	Well, im not wondering how to install.. i just figured there was a standard where most programs sat. If not, i can make my own, no biggie.
2008-06-14T06:51:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	Yea. Heh, i mean.. I've got my blender directory sitting in "/usr/local/" which just seems.. odd. Yet i was told to. Though there seems to be no reason why, since i just created a symlink to a dif spot anyway.. its just hacky.. heh
2008-06-14T06:51:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	Yea i know, thats why im asking for this simple case of "where to shove crap" heh
2008-06-14T06:52:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	I don't like the feel of "shoving crap" in /usr/local/
2008-06-14T06:53:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	I know, i just wanted to shove it where it belonged haha. Guess they dont really belong anywhere heh
2008-06-14T06:54:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	Sounds good, thank you
2008-07-11T05:50:00.000Z	ubunubi	Leefmc	i'd abandon both and just use synaptic..but unop will probably chime in and dissagree  :P
2008-07-11T05:50:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	That doesn't help me over ssh heh
2008-07-11T05:51:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	I didnt, but then again i didnt mention anything about a 3rd option. ;P
2008-07-11T05:51:00.000Z	Leefmc	ubunubi	So if you wanna get technical, hehe
