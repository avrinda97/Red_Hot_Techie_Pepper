2008-06-01T10:38:00.000Z	zachalink	usser	that didn't fix anything. not the sound, and not the pausing thing.
2008-06-01T10:40:00.000Z	usser	zachalink	hm that usually solves the issues, did u restart firefox, try killall pulseaudio && pulseaudio &
2008-06-01T10:40:00.000Z	usser	zachalink	the pausing thing is because of the sound
2008-06-01T10:41:00.000Z	zachalink	usser	do I do killall pulseaudio && pulseaudio & in terminal?
2008-06-01T10:41:00.000Z	usser	zachalink	yea

2008-06-01T10:47:00.000Z	zachalink	usser	they are supposed to be like that?
2008-06-01T10:48:00.000Z	usser	zachalink	the first one is something to worry about, quit all applications that use sound
2008-06-01T10:48:00.000Z	zachalink	usser	I have no applications open that use sound.
2008-06-01T10:48:00.000Z	usser	zachalink	try to restart
