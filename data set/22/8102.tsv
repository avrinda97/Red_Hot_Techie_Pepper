2005-11-30T16:18:00.000Z	chrisx1		how do i mount my USB device till i get my Breezy disk from my dads?
2005-11-30T16:20:00.000Z	pawan	chrisx1	modprobe usbcore uhci_hcd scsi_mod
2005-11-30T16:21:00.000Z	pawan	chrisx1	: I think that's the bunch of modules you need. Then fdisk -l to see what sda you have
2005-11-30T16:23:00.000Z	chrisx1	pawan	 Its not on there
2005-11-30T16:23:00.000Z	pawan	chrisx1	huh? you were talking about a webcam? I gave you the hints for a flashdrive :-/
2005-11-30T16:25:00.000Z	pawan	chrisx1	do: lsmod | grep scsi       and      lsmod | grep usb         do you get output for both?
2005-11-30T16:25:00.000Z	chrisx1	pawan	Initializing USB Mass Storage driver...
2005-11-30T16:26:00.000Z	pawan	chrisx1	watch it with the pasting
2005-11-30T16:26:00.000Z	chrisx1	pawan	sorry and yes it does give outputs
2005-11-30T16:26:00.000Z	pawan	chrisx1	: then fdisk -l   should  show sda or sdb or something.
2005-11-30T16:27:00.000Z	pawan	chrisx1	run fdisk -l as root.
2005-11-30T16:27:00.000Z	chrisx1	pawan	 can i paste the outputto u in pm?
2005-11-30T16:29:00.000Z	pawan	chrisx1	anyway, paste to http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl

2005-11-30T16:40:00.000Z	pawan	chrisx1	: beats me. Maybe you should rmmod the usb and scsi mods an try again.
2005-11-30T16:40:00.000Z	chrisx1	pawan	how?
2005-11-30T16:43:00.000Z	pawan	chrisx1	do an lsmod to check the scsi and usb modules are out the kernel, then modprobe them into the kernel again. Maybe last time the thing went glitchy.
2005-11-30T16:44:00.000Z	pawan	chrisx1	make sure the flash drive is in before you modprobe
2005-11-30T16:44:00.000Z	pawan	chrisx1	assuming nothing else is scsi, yes, rmmod them and the usb stuff.
2005-11-30T16:46:00.000Z	chrisx1	pawan	done
2005-11-30T16:47:00.000Z	pawan	chrisx1	I hope your keyboard isn't usb ;-)
