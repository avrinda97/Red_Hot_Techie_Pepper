2007-01-09T12:39:00.000Z	adaptr	riotkittie	what behaviour
2007-01-09T12:39:00.000Z	riotkittie	adaptr	the behavior jlewis_ is talking about
2007-01-14T16:29:00.000Z	adaptr	riotkittie	I dare you to run paint
2007-01-14T16:30:00.000Z	riotkittie	adaptr	i might :P  i havent touched paint since ~92.  i wonder if it still has the spray can tool
2007-01-14T16:31:00.000Z	adaptr	riotkittie	it probably has at least one more button by now, although I must say it hasn;t changed that much in 15+ years :)
2007-01-14T16:32:00.000Z	adaptr	riotkittie	MS probably thought it a good idea  not to mess with their one stable application
2007-01-14T16:32:00.000Z	riotkittie	adaptr	ew. did you have to mention the number of years?  i feel old now.
2007-01-14T16:32:00.000Z	adaptr	riotkittie	own up to it, mate :)
2007-01-14T16:36:00.000Z	adaptr	riotkittie	perfectly clear to me :)
2007-01-21T12:18:00.000Z	adaptr	riotkittie	tilda ?
2007-01-21T12:18:00.000Z	adaptr	riotkittie	oh.. aha, I have yakuake :)
2007-01-21T12:18:00.000Z	riotkittie	adaptr	ah :)
2007-02-03T06:55:00.000Z	adaptr	riotkittie	that's useless if you don't know what the problem is
2007-02-03T06:55:00.000Z	adaptr	riotkittie	if the liveCD b0rks then reconfigure is also not very likely to help
2007-02-19T06:12:00.000Z	adaptr	riotkittie	as long as grub can find a kernel, that's enough
2007-10-17T23:29:00.000Z	riotkittie	adaptr	#ubuntu+1 for gutsy support
2007-10-17T23:30:00.000Z	adaptr	riotkittie	heh should have known
