2005-04-17T13:36:00.000Z	closure		i have a problem with ubuntu
2005-04-17T13:36:00.000Z	closure		perhaps someone else has as well
2005-04-17T13:36:00.000Z	Arnia	closure	Settle out of court ;)
2005-04-17T13:37:00.000Z	closure		when i close my laptop and i open it back up
2005-04-17T13:37:00.000Z	closure		it will not reload
2005-04-17T13:37:00.000Z	Arnia	closure	Ctrl + Alt + 7 then touch a key
2005-04-17T13:37:00.000Z	closure		it stays black like it's suspended but i've set it to not goto suspend
2005-04-17T13:37:00.000Z	closure	Arnia	hrm
2005-04-17T13:37:00.000Z	closure		ok
2005-04-17T13:37:00.000Z	closure		is there a way to make it automatic?
2005-04-17T13:38:00.000Z	closure		or simply not goto suspend like that?
2005-04-17T13:38:00.000Z	Arnia	closure	I think its an ACPI bug. Its not suspending, just changing terminals
2005-04-17T13:38:00.000Z	closure	Arnia	 so what exactly does ctrl+alt+7 do?
2005-04-17T13:39:00.000Z	Arnia	closure	Changes the virtual terminal to the one X (the graphics layer) sits on
2005-04-17T13:40:00.000Z	closure		well if it's just changing terminals why does it goto a black screen
2005-04-17T13:40:00.000Z	closure		wouldn't it be a console login?
2005-04-17T13:40:00.000Z	Arnia	closure	Not if the terminal isn't one with a login attached
2005-04-17T13:40:00.000Z	Arnia	closure	Like I said, I think its ACPI messing up
2005-04-17T13:43:00.000Z	closure	Arnia	what is ACPI?
2005-04-17T13:44:00.000Z	Arnia	closure	The power management 'standard' used on PCs
2005-04-17T13:44:00.000Z	Arnia	closure	Its not a very strictly followed standard though
2005-04-17T13:44:00.000Z	Arnia	closure	And hence sometimes the software support messes up
