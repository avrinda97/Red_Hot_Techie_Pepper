2010-02-02T10:20:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Blue11	what provoked all that info? i mean what command brought it about?
2010-02-02T10:21:00.000Z	Blue11	arghh2d2	dmsg and mtp-detect
2010-02-02T10:23:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Blue11	try unplugging it then ls /dev/  then plug it back in, wait a sec, and run ls /dev again and see if theres a new device listed, usually like sda or sdb or hda or hdb maybe
2010-02-02T10:24:00.000Z	Blue11	arghh2d2	okay
2010-02-02T10:25:00.000Z	Blue11	arghh2d2	whoa that's a lot of output
2010-02-02T10:25:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Blue11	look for a differnce in the hd and sd areas
2010-02-02T10:26:00.000Z	Blue11	arghh2d2	i think I will put output to files and then run diff
2010-02-02T10:27:00.000Z	Blue11	arghh2d2	diff output:  23a24
2010-02-02T10:29:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Blue11	i googled it and it looks like you might need to use the mtp plugin with rhythmbox, have you tried that?
2010-02-02T10:30:00.000Z	Blue11	arghh2d2	well no -- this sorta was a show stopper for me:  Feb  1 20:44:04 Homer kernel: [360360.004490] scsi 14:0:0:0: Device offlined - not ready after error recovery
2010-02-02T10:31:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Blue11	you could also try: mkdir ~/fuze && sudo mount /dev/libmtp-1-6 ~/fuze
2010-02-02T10:38:00.000Z	Blue11	arghh2d2	the hokey pokey solution -- http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/61  BUT it does work - 2 hands needed!
2010-02-02T10:40:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Blue11	nice
2010-02-02T10:41:00.000Z	Blue11	arghh2d2	heh  -- it's a 2 handed operation for sure - but it did mount
2010-02-02T10:41:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Blue11	as long as the cat gets skinned, all that matters
2010-02-02T10:42:00.000Z	Blue11	arghh2d2	well it's steller transfer rate of 2.6 meg/sec
2010-02-02T10:49:00.000Z	Blue11	arghh2d2	wow the hokey pokey worked!
