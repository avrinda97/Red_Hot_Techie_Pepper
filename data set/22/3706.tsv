2008-12-07T21:51:00.000Z	aditya1		I just updated  my system (ubuntu 8.04) to the latest available packages yesterday. Initially when i start the computer , the keyboard works properly, after some time it stops working completely and at times starts again. Is this some kind system problem ?? or my computer has been infected by some malicious program,virus,etc ?
2008-12-07T21:52:00.000Z	ompaul	aditya1	have you rebooted since you upgraded?
2008-12-07T21:53:00.000Z	aditya1	ompaul	joaopinto: i know there are no viruses but the KBD stops working at times
2008-12-07T21:53:00.000Z	ompaul	aditya1	did you reboot?
2008-12-07T21:53:00.000Z	aditya1	ompaul	joaopinto: yes , i have rebooted several times
2008-12-07T21:54:00.000Z	ompaul	aditya1	try to see if there is another upgrade still available (i.e. something did not upgrade yesterday that should have)
2008-12-07T21:54:00.000Z	aditya1	ompaul	i just checked before 10 mins
2008-12-07T21:55:00.000Z	aditya1	ompaul	and everything is updated..
2008-12-07T21:55:00.000Z	ompaul	aditya1	put the keyboard in a different slot
2008-12-07T21:56:00.000Z	aditya1	ompaul	have only one slot, but i checked the keyboard in centOS and it works well on it....currently i am on ubuntu 8.04
2008-12-07T21:57:00.000Z	ompaul	aditya1	and you have checked it on centos since this problem started?
2008-12-07T21:57:00.000Z	aditya1	ompaul	yes, everything is well on centOS
2008-12-07T21:58:00.000Z	ompaul	aditya1	looks like hal is having a problem and other than use a different port I don't have an answer for you
2008-12-07T21:59:00.000Z	aditya1	ompaul	:: hal is having a problem ???
2008-12-07T21:59:00.000Z	ompaul	aditya1	the hardware abstraction layer
2008-12-07T22:00:00.000Z	aditya1	ompaul	ok
2008-12-07T22:00:00.000Z	ompaul	aditya1	however what you describe is typical of some hardware problem with a keyboard or the machine itself
2008-12-07T22:01:00.000Z	aditya1	ompaul	is there a possibility of my keystrokes being sent to some one else ?
2008-12-07T22:01:00.000Z	ompaul	aditya1	is it wireless?
2008-12-07T22:01:00.000Z	aditya1	ompaul	no
2008-12-07T22:02:00.000Z	ompaul	aditya1	then no
2008-12-07T22:02:00.000Z	aditya1	ompaul	ok...thanks
