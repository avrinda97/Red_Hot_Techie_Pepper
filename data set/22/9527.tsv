2005-03-07T08:19:00.000Z	djk1		so, I can't install gnome because of libnautilus2-2 not being available.
2005-03-07T08:19:00.000Z	djk1		is there any way around that?
2005-03-07T08:21:00.000Z	djk1		goddamnit
2005-03-07T08:21:00.000Z	djk1		:(
2005-03-07T08:21:00.000Z	djk1		ok
2005-03-07T08:21:00.000Z	djk1		I'm running hoary but I'll go get it
2005-03-07T08:23:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djk1	I don't even have that package installed just remove it
2005-03-07T08:23:00.000Z	djk1		it is removed
2005-03-07T08:23:00.000Z	djk1		that's the thing
2005-03-07T08:23:00.000Z	djk1		when I try to install 'gnome'
2005-03-07T08:23:00.000Z	djk1		it says it can't install that because gnome-desktop-environment isn't installed
2005-03-07T08:23:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djk1	I upgraded the other day and it's not install on my system
2005-03-07T08:23:00.000Z	djk1		when I try to install THAT package, it claims nautilus-media is not installed
2005-03-07T08:24:00.000Z	djk1		and when I try to install nautilus-media it complains about libnautilus2-2
2005-03-07T08:24:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djk1	can you try to install ubuntu-desktop
2005-03-07T08:24:00.000Z	djk1		I'll give it a shot
2005-03-07T08:25:00.000Z	djk1		ok ubuntu-desktop is installing again
2005-03-07T08:25:00.000Z	djk1		hopefully this will fix it LinuxJones, thanks.
2005-03-07T08:25:00.000Z	djk1	tubezeroonethree	that doesn't install libnautilus2-2
2005-03-07T08:25:00.000Z	djk1		tried already
2005-03-07T08:25:00.000Z	djk1		:)
2005-03-07T08:25:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djk1	it will be fine :)
