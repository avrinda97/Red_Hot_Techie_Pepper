2006-03-20T13:08:00.000Z	rob138		like when you are on a word document or webpage, and you want to scroll down, or scroll through items in nautilis, you normally can hold down an arrow key to do so, but i have to keep pushing it per each entry/scroll

2006-03-20T13:09:00.000Z	martyv	rob138	so we are talking about an auto-repeat?
