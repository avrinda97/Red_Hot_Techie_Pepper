2006-09-22T07:28:00.000Z	jrib	sess	/msg ubotu foo is bar      <-- he will relay the information to operators for review
2007-02-03T17:58:00.000Z	jrib	sess	that's a bad idea probably
2007-02-03T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	sess	just call python2.5 when you want python2.5
2007-02-03T06:02:00.000Z	sess	jrib	I can't manually call it, beryl requires python 2.5, as a result its broken
2007-02-03T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	sess	what exactly in beryl requires python 2.5?
2007-02-03T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	sess	edit the python script and change the first line to call python2.5 then.  That is what I would do
2007-02-03T06:03:00.000Z	sess	jrib	I did that, then I get the error that the modules that were installed are missing
2007-02-03T06:04:00.000Z	sess	jrib	yet when I call it with python 2.4 the modules are present, so they've been installed into teh wrong place
2007-02-03T06:04:00.000Z	sess	jrib	and I don't actually KNOW where they are :(
2007-02-03T06:04:00.000Z	jrib	sess	that's the thing... python2.4 looks in python2.4 areas, python2.5 looks in different places
2007-02-03T06:05:00.000Z	jrib	sess	I think the best course of action is to try #ubuntu-xgl, #beryl, or the beryl forums since this is probably affecting a lot of people
2007-02-03T06:06:00.000Z	jrib	sess	if you really want to test your theory that this will work, just create a link named "python" in /usr/local/bin that points to /usr/bin/python2.5 .  Like I said though, i think that's a bad idea and you should remove it after you test this
2007-02-03T06:06:00.000Z	sess	jrib	I did that too, didn't work still can't find the modules
2007-02-03T06:07:00.000Z	jrib	sess	what modules exactly?
2007-02-03T06:08:00.000Z	sess	jrib	Im assuming berylsettings.so
2007-02-03T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	sess	what makes you think you need 2.5?
2007-02-03T06:09:00.000Z	sess	jrib	says so in the forum when I found that someone else had the same problem as me
2007-02-03T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	sess	ah ok
