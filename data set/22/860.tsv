2011-03-03T07:51:00.000Z	crimsonmane		My Linksys Wireless USB 600 device likes to "stop functioning." It was necessarily installed via NDISwrapper. The time-out used to occur when going idle but i now notice it timed-out when not idle. In fact i was in here. Only a system reboot brings it back to life. After a time-out the computer thinks its still alive. Any thoughts are much appreciated. Private Messages accepted. Thanks.
