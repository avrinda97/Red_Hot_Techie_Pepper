2010-02-26T05:01:00.000Z	Guest51742	Typos_King	i already have that installed.....(?)
2010-02-26T05:01:00.000Z	Typos_King	Guest51742	    b43-fwcutter, no, you have to get it from the repos.... the .o files you can dl from that url
2010-02-26T05:02:00.000Z	Guest51742	Typos_King	it says it's already installed...i'm purging it and reinstalling it now
2010-02-26T05:02:00.000Z	Typos_King	Guest51742	    k, then if it's already installed, run the lines it has there, to include the firmware files, and reboot when done
2010-02-26T05:03:00.000Z	Guest51742	Typos_King	it seems like the only line to run is apt-get install b43.....  am i wrong?
2010-02-26T05:04:00.000Z	Typos_King	Guest51742	      check in Bash if it's installed, type b43-fw<tab>
2010-02-26T05:04:00.000Z	Guest51742	Typos_King	I just purged it. im going to install now. but that link you sent me only says to install it - there's nothing else to do
2010-02-26T05:04:00.000Z	Guest51742	Typos_King	my output didn't look like his
2010-02-26T05:05:00.000Z	Typos_King	Guest51742	      ... lemme check a better url
