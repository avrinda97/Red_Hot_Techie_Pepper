2005-01-01T09:25:00.000Z	Blackwell		hm. good to see that it is not only java developers who get "deprecated" wrong all the time. ;)
2005-01-01T09:26:00.000Z	Pozac	Blackwell	its deprecation or what win32 has become :)
2005-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pozac	win32, deprecated? funk, nobody told me. i need to tell my boss, we need to cancel the current project. :)
2005-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	Pozac	Blackwell	Its not. It should. :)
2005-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pozac	ah, perhaps, like any c level api :)
2005-01-06T11:37:00.000Z	Pozac	Blackwell	do you run nautilus in browser mode?
2005-01-06T11:37:00.000Z	Pozac	Blackwell	I dont think there is a side-pane in nautilus default mode
2005-01-06T11:37:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pozac	aha. the goal is to have that helpful tree view. the side pane seems to be able to display that, that got me the idea to open it...
2005-01-06T11:38:00.000Z	Pozac	Blackwell	correct
2005-01-06T11:42:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pozac	i don't know what mode it is in. how do i find out?
2005-01-06T11:43:00.000Z	Pozac	Blackwell	System -> Settings -> File Manager -> Behaviour -> Always use Browser
2005-01-06T11:43:00.000Z	Pozac	Blackwell	(my Gnome is not english, so it's not 100% correct)
2005-01-06T11:45:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pozac	i see. sucks not to have the english variant, makes communication hard. which is why i installed the english variant. unfortunately it defaults to english keyboard layout then. makes entering more special chars a challenge...:|
2005-01-06T11:46:00.000Z	Pozac	Blackwell	:(
2005-01-06T11:46:00.000Z	Pozac	Blackwell	but you did enable the browser mode?
2005-01-06T11:47:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pozac	i cannot find something called "system" already. there is Computer/"System Configuration"
2005-01-06T11:49:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pozac	top menu bar, "Computer", "System Configuration", is that what you are refering to?
2005-01-06T12:02:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pozac	ah, firing up nautilus with "nautilus --browser" did the job. thank you.
2005-01-06T13:50:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pozac	ah, thank you.
2005-01-06T13:51:00.000Z	Pozac	Blackwell	gdm usually shows the error msg when it fails though
2005-01-06T14:14:00.000Z	Pozac	Blackwell	gnome-vfs now uses a user-space mount thingie, so it's in /tmp somewhere
2005-01-06T14:14:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pozac	i see
