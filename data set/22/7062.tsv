2007-02-27T15:18:00.000Z	bluesign	bruenig	thanks a lot
2007-02-27T15:21:00.000Z	bruenig	bluesign	you would need two drives
2007-02-27T15:22:00.000Z	bluesign	bruenig	2 cd/dvd drives?
2007-02-27T15:22:00.000Z	bruenig	bluesign	yeah one running the live cd and the other for burning
2007-02-27T15:34:00.000Z	bluesign	bruenig	as i don't have two drives, can grub boot iso ?
2007-03-25T11:22:00.000Z	bruenig	bluesign	are you sure that is the name of it, generally ubuntu doesn't name it /dev/dvd it names it /dev/hd something
2007-03-25T11:22:00.000Z	bluesign	bruenig	it is /dev/hdc actualy, /dev/dvd is symlinked to it i guess
2007-03-25T11:22:00.000Z	bruenig	bluesign	well try mounting /dev/hdc
2007-03-25T11:23:00.000Z	bluesign	bruenig	same result
2007-03-25T11:23:00.000Z	bruenig	bluesign	where is it mounting?
2007-03-25T11:23:00.000Z	bluesign	bruenig	/media/cdrom0
2007-03-25T11:23:00.000Z	bruenig	bluesign	and there is nothing in there?
2007-03-25T11:24:00.000Z	bruenig	bluesign	mounted inside /media/cdrom0
2007-03-25T11:24:00.000Z	bruenig	bluesign	so /media/cdrom0/dvd
2007-03-25T11:25:00.000Z	bruenig	bluesign	but you are telling me it is /media/cdrom0/dvd
2007-03-25T11:25:00.000Z	bluesign	bruenig	yep
2007-03-25T11:25:00.000Z	bruenig	bluesign	that doesn't make any sense in any possible way
2007-03-25T11:26:00.000Z	bluesign	bruenig	yep that's why I  cannot understand
2007-03-25T11:27:00.000Z	bluesign	bruenig	how can i troubleshoot?
2007-03-25T11:27:00.000Z	bruenig	bluesign	I don't know, if you do figure it out though, tell me
2007-03-25T11:27:00.000Z	bluesign	bruenig	ok :)
