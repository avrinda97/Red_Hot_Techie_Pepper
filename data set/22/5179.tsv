2008-04-28T04:03:00.000Z	Pelo	psycardis	adding it to /etc/local.rc maybe ?
2008-04-28T04:05:00.000Z	Pelo	psycardis	my mistake   /etc/rc.local  it is used to list scripts you want to run on startup
2008-04-28T04:08:00.000Z	Pelo	psycardis	 toward the end,  I use it to start fancontrol,   add the path and file you need at the end of the file assuming this line is to start a process or perform an action ,   in my case  /etc/init.d/fancontrol
2008-04-28T04:10:00.000Z	Pelo	psycardis	 you still haveniT' told me what the line you want to add is ? what werer you tring to put in the other file ?
2008-04-28T04:11:00.000Z	Pelo	psycardis	put that line in exactly like that
2008-04-28T04:12:00.000Z	Pelo	psycardis	you also have the option to create the file yo were told to put it in , that might work to
2008-04-28T04:12:00.000Z	Pelo	psycardis	I'm only guessing but yes
