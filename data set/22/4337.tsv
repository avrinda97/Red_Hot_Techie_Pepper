2011-03-23T03:21:00.000Z	icewaterman		i have sound in some applications if i specify them to use alsa

2011-03-23T03:23:00.000Z	icewaterman	ActionParsnip	acer extensa 5635
2011-03-23T03:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icewaterman	did you add: options snd-hda-intel model=acer    in /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
2011-03-23T03:26:00.000Z	icewaterman	ActionParsnip	not yet
2011-03-23T03:26:00.000Z	icewaterman	ActionParsnip	i will reboot to see if that works
2011-03-23T03:29:00.000Z	icewaterman	ActionParsnip	adding that line didnt help :-(
2011-03-23T03:30:00.000Z	icewaterman	ActionParsnip	the chip seems to be from Conexant
2011-03-23T03:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icewaterman	can you give the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && bash ./alsa-info.sh
2011-03-23T03:35:00.000Z	icewaterman	ActionParsnip	http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=672f7fd18974b71e707db3727bcd8c8213ce7f26
2011-03-23T03:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icewaterman	try running: alsamixer    and cranking levels and unmjuting as needed
2011-03-23T03:37:00.000Z	icewaterman	ActionParsnip	thats the first thing i tried
2011-03-23T03:38:00.000Z	icewaterman	ActionParsnip	alsamixer doesnt show me pulse, only the device directly
2011-03-23T03:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	icewaterman	also try in alsa-base.conf   model=generic   or    model=laptop   instead of   model=acer   like before
2011-03-23T03:59:00.000Z	icewaterman	ActionParsnip	neither option helped with my connexant soundcard (intel-hda)
2011-03-23T04:24:00.000Z	icewaterman	ActionParsnip	i dont know what exactly changed, but my sound issue disappeared. its not any change to alsa-base.conf etc.
2011-03-23T04:25:00.000Z	icewaterman	ActionParsnip	thx for help, sorry i cannot tell what really fixed the problem, since i've undone every change i made (and rebooted afterwards9
