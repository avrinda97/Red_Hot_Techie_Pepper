2006-02-24T12:02:00.000Z	speyer		why removing totem player will remove ubuntu-desktop too ? its this ok ?
2006-02-24T12:02:00.000Z	_jason	speyer	it is ok, ubuntu-desktop is just a meta package
2006-02-24T12:03:00.000Z	speyer	_jason	thanks
2006-02-24T12:08:00.000Z	speyer	_jason	whats this evolution package for ? its really required ?
2006-02-24T12:08:00.000Z	_jason	speyer	I think parts of gnome depend on it, not sure.  It's a mail client
2006-02-24T12:09:00.000Z	_jason	speyer	you can try and see how much stuff it will take with it
2006-02-24T12:09:00.000Z	speyer	_jason	it will also remove evolution-plugins and evolution-exchange
2006-03-01T12:40:00.000Z	_jason	speyer	/ignore them?
2006-03-01T12:40:00.000Z	speyer	_jason	well they still can ping the server :)
2006-03-01T12:40:00.000Z	speyer	_jason	so thats not a good option ...
2006-03-01T12:40:00.000Z	_jason	speyer	oh, thought you meant on irc
2006-03-01T12:40:00.000Z	speyer	_jason	yeah on irc too
2006-03-01T12:41:00.000Z	_jason	speyer	block their ip with a firewall then?
2006-03-01T12:41:00.000Z	speyer	_jason	well let`s say im not at home .. its there not a way to drop anything coming from the same ip more then 3 time`s ping or whatever in 2 min ?
2006-03-01T12:42:00.000Z	speyer	_jason	like if you ping me more then 3 times in 2 min then iptables will deog any other pings from you
2006-03-01T12:42:00.000Z	_jason	speyer	yeah, I've seen something like that, I can't remember what it is called.  Someone else here probably knows
2006-03-01T12:43:00.000Z	_jason	speyer	I think ubuntuforums.org was where I saw it so you may want to try searching while you wait around here for an answer
2006-03-01T12:44:00.000Z	speyer	_jason	firestarter shows me a big list with hostnames , looks like people tryed to get into the smtp and http server , which doesnt even run :)
2006-03-01T12:45:00.000Z	speyer	_jason	they tryed , port 25 and 80 bassic...
2006-03-02T07:39:00.000Z	_jason	speyer	you can use k3b, or gnomebaker.  But k3b is better
2006-03-02T07:42:00.000Z	_jason	speyer	just use gnomebaker then and see if it does what you need it to.  If you find it's lacking, then install k3b
2006-03-02T07:42:00.000Z	speyer	_jason	well can this gnomebaker burn all the files as k3b ?
