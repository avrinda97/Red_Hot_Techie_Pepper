2006-03-31T17:12:00.000Z	tkup	mi6	there's a chance that the hard drive is going bad, especially the sector where /etc/pam.d resides
2006-03-31T17:13:00.000Z	mi6	tkup	Negative redguy told me to run fsck, and it ran fine no errors.
2006-03-31T17:14:00.000Z	tkup	mi6	boot the kernel with the option 'noinotify'
2006-03-31T17:16:00.000Z	mi6	tkup	Ok at grup prompt i edit the command line and insert -noinotify , is that what i should do ??
2006-03-31T17:16:00.000Z	mi6	tkup	Ok at grub prompt i edit the command line and insert -noinotify , is that what i should do ??
2006-03-31T17:17:00.000Z	tkup	mi6	insert inotify within the line that's similar to "/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.10-5-386 root=/dev/hda1 ro quiet splash" without the hiphen/dash
2006-03-31T17:17:00.000Z	tkup	mi6	in my case that would be /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.10-5-386 root=/dev/hda1 ro noinotify quiet splash
2006-03-31T17:17:00.000Z	mi6	tkup	ok thanx rebooting again, will be back soon.
2006-03-31T17:28:00.000Z	mi6	tkup	still not able to login, but...but now pam.d is completely empty
2006-03-31T17:38:00.000Z	tkup	mi6	remove the directory /etc/pam.d and create a file /etc/pam.conf with these lines in it http://pastebin.com/622443
2006-03-31T17:38:00.000Z	tkup	mi6	remove /etc/pam.d only if it contains nothing
2006-03-31T17:43:00.000Z	mi6	tkup	please see my status update at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=150133
2006-03-31T17:43:00.000Z	tkup	mi6	so how were you able to use your system without it freezing on you?
2006-03-31T17:45:00.000Z	mi6	tkup	i think while there was anything in /etc/pam.d/ it froze up in all Knoppix, ubuntu live & normal grub boot
2006-03-31T17:46:00.000Z	mi6	tkup	now i booted using ubuntu recovery and did ls -l /etc/pam.d/ it did not freeze like b4 when i did it
2006-03-31T17:46:00.000Z	mi6	tkup	/etc/pam.d/ is empty now
2006-03-31T17:47:00.000Z	mi6	tkup	should i check again with knoppic
2006-03-31T17:50:00.000Z	tkup	mi6	if your machine has internet access, do this at the shell prompt: apt-get remove libpam-modules; apt-get install libpam-modules
2006-03-31T17:51:00.000Z	mi6	tkup	going for reboot to try apt-get command failing which regenerating pam.conf like you said, c ya in a moment
