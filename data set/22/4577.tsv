2007-12-27T02:26:00.000Z	LimCore		hello,  how to rebuild the kernel that I have (in 7.10 amd64 bit) but exacly for my amd64 (not generic) SMP,  and while aplying to it grsecurity patch? (so perhaps it will be other version like 23.9)
2007-12-27T02:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	LimCore	also grsecurity is a *very* *intrusive* patch. i do not think is a good idea to use it
2007-12-27T02:32:00.000Z	LimCore	erUSUL	well, I need a grsecurity... any other way to use it?
2007-12-27T02:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	LimCore	if you really need there is no other way... go ahead and compile a custom kernel
2007-12-27T02:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	LimCore	mldonkey connects to a few servers (3 or 4) at once
2007-12-27T02:36:00.000Z	LimCore	erUSUL	well I started ML donkey but it isnt conntect.... what now O_o
2007-12-27T02:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	LimCore	are you using the web interface?
2007-12-27T02:37:00.000Z	LimCore	erUSUL	hmm no... just srtarted mlgui
2007-12-27T02:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	LimCore	maybe you need to import a servers.met file first like in amule the web interface has the option of import a Server.met i can't see it in mlgui...
2007-12-27T02:41:00.000Z	LimCore	erUSUL	uhm
2007-12-27T02:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	LimCore	mldonkey works for me
2007-12-27T02:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	LimCore	amule is fragile
2007-12-27T02:42:00.000Z	LimCore	erUSUL	well it do not have any serves I can onnect to
2007-12-27T02:42:00.000Z	LimCore	erUSUL	can you give me url of a popular server or something?
2007-12-27T02:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	LimCore	as i said you need to import an initial servers.met file
2007-12-27T02:43:00.000Z	LimCore	erUSUL	where from / how?
2007-12-27T02:45:00.000Z	LimCore	erUSUL	can you just give me IP of a server then
2007-12-27T02:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	LimCore	wait a minute
