2006-11-25T14:37:00.000Z	nilson		completely new to debian/ubuntu-what is universe
2006-11-25T14:37:00.000Z	nilson		Im from gentoo
2006-11-25T14:37:00.000Z	nilson		how do I get it
2006-11-25T14:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	By editing your xources.list file or with System -> Administration -> Software sources.
2007-10-28T08:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	Gutsy?
2007-10-28T08:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	have you tried System -> Administration -> Restricted Driver Manager?
2007-10-28T08:21:00.000Z	nilson	Jordan_U	I have the window up but I did disable the stock bcm43xx driver as per the ndiswrapper instructions
2007-10-28T08:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	You should always try the native drivers before ndiswrapper
2007-10-28T08:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	remove bcm43xx from the blacklist
2007-10-28T08:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	Unblacklist bcm43xx and grab the file that restricted manager needs from another computer
2007-10-28T08:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	It gives you a URL to get it from when you try to enable it in Restricted Manager
2007-10-28T08:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	np :)
2007-10-28T10:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	What is the problem?
2007-10-28T10:07:00.000Z	nilson	Jordan_U	the damn fsck freezes up like every time I boot now
2007-10-28T10:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	Ooh, not good, are you sure that your drive is not failing?
2007-10-28T10:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	fsck should definitely not be running every boot
2007-10-28T10:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	Well you should have
2007-10-28T10:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	That is about the worst thing you could do
2007-10-28T10:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	Though there should be HD activity
2007-10-28T10:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	Try booting without the "splash" parameter
2007-10-28T10:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	Is the only reason why you don't want to install because you will have to get your wireless working again?
2007-10-28T10:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nilson	Now that you know to use the native drivers instead of ndiswrapper wireless should be easy
