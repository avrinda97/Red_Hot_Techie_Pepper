2006-10-26T07:57:00.000Z	kuja		I want to put the Ubuntu repository of i386 packages on my iPod so I can upgrade at home. What's the easy way?
2006-10-26T07:57:00.000Z	kuja		I want all i386 packages from main, multiverse, restricted, and universe. How can I do this?
2006-10-26T07:58:00.000Z	dabaR	kuja	download the iso to the ipod, then install from the iso
2006-10-26T07:58:00.000Z	kuja	dabaR	The ISO doesn't have the other pools like multivers and universe
2006-10-26T07:59:00.000Z	dabaR	kuja	yes, it does not.
2006-10-26T07:59:00.000Z	kuja	dabaR	I want them.
2006-10-26T08:00:00.000Z	dabaR	kuja	well, you will have to download them by hand then. You are not gonna download all of universe and multivers. you can find out what packages you have installd with sudo dpkg -l at home, and then download newest versions of all your packages at packages.ubuntu.com
2006-10-26T08:00:00.000Z	kuja	dabaR	That's a lot of packages to download by hand, even if I *knew* what needed to be upgraded.
2006-10-26T08:01:00.000Z	dabaR	kuja	no
2006-10-26T08:19:00.000Z	dabaR	kuja	does google?
2006-10-26T08:19:00.000Z	kuja	dabaR	There was one link, but it's dead. Everything else, nothing knows.
2006-10-26T11:50:00.000Z	dabaR	kuja	visit the components page about ubuntu.
2006-10-26T11:51:00.000Z	dabaR	kuja	go read the components page
2006-12-09T09:20:00.000Z	dabaR	kuja	so it does hd(4,X)?
2006-12-09T09:21:00.000Z	kuja	dabaR	No, it does root=/dev/hdd2, when it should be root=/dev/hdb2
2006-12-09T09:21:00.000Z	dabaR	kuja	in menu.lst?
2006-12-09T09:23:00.000Z	dabaR	kuja	grub reads the /boot/grub/menu.lst file, afaik.
2006-12-09T09:23:00.000Z	kuja	dabaR	Yes, now what does update-grub read?
2006-12-09T09:23:00.000Z	dabaR	kuja	the man page does not talk about it?
2006-12-09T09:23:00.000Z	kuja	dabaR	I've been searching for an hour (and I've read the man page)
2006-12-09T09:24:00.000Z	dabaR	kuja	afaik also, it should also not read device nodes, but devices
2006-12-09T09:25:00.000Z	dabaR	kuja	when you run update-grub, do you have hdd mounted as root? you need to chroot, then.
