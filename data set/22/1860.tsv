2009-12-19T10:21:00.000Z	zoug	dumducky	using synaptic?
2009-12-19T10:22:00.000Z	dumducky	zoug	it's not in the repositories available from a live CD -- I just looked
2009-12-19T10:22:00.000Z	zoug	dumducky	you can update the repo in live-cd
2009-12-19T10:23:00.000Z	dumducky	zoug	is it in 'Universe' ?
2009-12-19T10:24:00.000Z	zoug	dumducky	sys admn:universe, yeah
2009-12-19T10:24:00.000Z	zoug	dumducky	reload synaptic
2009-12-19T10:25:00.000Z	zoug	dumducky	reload synaptic and make sure universe is activated in your sources..
2009-12-19T10:25:00.000Z	dumducky	zoug	reloading packages...
2009-12-19T10:27:00.000Z	zoug	dumducky	EastDallas: why do all that to install aptoncd?
2009-12-19T10:30:00.000Z	zoug	dumducky	why would you want default packages from a live-cd through aptoncd?
2009-12-19T10:31:00.000Z	dumducky	zoug	CDMA connection to Inet -- just want to install Gnome in environment with *no* Inet.  Was thinking I could just wget all the .debs, copy to locally mounted media, reboot and install with dpkg -i but Gnome has *major* dependencies and recommends and packages.ubuntu.com does not have *metapackages*  (the 'virtual' section is .  empty)  [takes_breath()-1]....
2009-12-19T10:35:00.000Z	zoug	dumducky	are you done installing aptoncd?
2009-12-19T10:36:00.000Z	dumducky	zoug	at 20kBps, took a while just to refresh package lists... working...
2009-12-19T10:38:00.000Z	dumducky	zoug	seems like APTonCD wasn't in the Universe repo...  =oP
2009-12-19T10:38:00.000Z	zoug	dumducky	i double checked it
2009-12-19T10:38:00.000Z	zoug	dumducky	it is there..
2009-12-19T10:39:00.000Z	zoug	dumducky	did you activated the universe repo from your sources?
2009-12-19T10:41:00.000Z	zoug	dumducky	cant you wget it
2009-12-19T11:00:00.000Z	dumducky	zoug	type !help at in any window for a list of irssi commands -- there is a command switch to do what you want -- something like VERBOSE()
2009-12-19T11:01:00.000Z	zoug	dumducky	hmm
