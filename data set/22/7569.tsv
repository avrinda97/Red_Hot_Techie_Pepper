2006-05-27T16:42:00.000Z	Marsmensch		anyone has a pretty nice index.php for indexing und creating thumbails from a directory with images? sorry for ot
2006-05-27T16:44:00.000Z	Marsmensch		hey zuhause01, join #ubuntu-de for german help ;)
2006-05-27T06:29:00.000Z	Marsmensch		hmmm i tried gallery now, doesn't really impress me much. :-/
2006-05-27T06:30:00.000Z	apokryphos	Marsmensch	yeah, it's not great. Use flickr 8)
2006-05-27T06:32:00.000Z	Marsmensch	apokryphos	flickr? never heard about it? at the moment i use a shellscript, creating thumbnails and html code for me ... thought php would be nicer ... but it's also harder
2006-05-27T06:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	Marsmensch	shellscript might be good practice for bash :P, but there are already some decent enough simplistic HTML converters out there (Konqueror has an option, Digikam too)
2006-05-27T06:33:00.000Z	Marsmensch	apokryphos	you have some scrennshoots or something?
2006-05-27T06:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	Marsmensch	http://flickr.com is flickr, by the way
2006-05-27T06:34:00.000Z	Marsmensch	apokryphos	yeah, you know the google prog to create websites? i have used shellscript to create so looking code ;)
2006-05-27T06:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	Marsmensch	erm, I guess I could take one now
2006-05-27T06:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	Marsmensch	yeah, good for your grandma, bad for anyone who knwos about html/css :P
2006-05-27T06:36:00.000Z	apokryphos	Marsmensch	http://giannaros.org/hmlgallery.png
2006-05-27T06:36:00.000Z	apokryphos	Marsmensch	dang, wrong image
2006-05-27T06:37:00.000Z	Marsmensch	apokryphos	yes, i have seen ;)
2006-05-27T06:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	Marsmensch	http://giannaros.org/htmlgallery.png
2006-05-27T06:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	Marsmensch	of course the basics there are configurable. Digikam has a few more options though, you can have galleries like: http://www.omat.nl/drupal/?q=node/75
2006-05-27T06:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	Marsmensch	not greatly beautiful, of course; but simplistic and very quickly generated.
2006-05-27T06:39:00.000Z	apokryphos	Marsmensch	the html gallery?
2006-05-27T06:41:00.000Z	Marsmensch	apokryphos	2 more questions: can you say something about the size of the prog? and second, how to use it? is it like a prog or more like a webinterface?? yeah the html gallery ... contains also css ;-)
2006-05-27T06:41:00.000Z	apokryphos	Marsmensch	the first one I showed you a screeny from is just an option in konqueror. Tools > Create Image Gallery
2006-05-27T06:43:00.000Z	apokryphos	Marsmensch	Konqueror is KDE's File Manager and Web Browser
2006-05-27T06:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	Marsmensch	digikam has an option too, though; it's available in the repositories
