2007-08-21T14:51:00.000Z	tigran		Hey, my internet (wifi) is really unstable, its connected but I can't load web pages and takes forever to connect to IRC. What can I do?
2007-08-21T14:52:00.000Z	HighNo	tigran	are you connecting via dsl?
2007-08-21T14:53:00.000Z	tigran	HighNo	yes
2007-08-21T14:55:00.000Z	HighNo	tigran	do you know your network interface's name?
2007-08-21T14:56:00.000Z	HighNo	tigran	try sudo ifconfig ath0 mtu 1400
2007-08-21T14:57:00.000Z	tigran	HighNo	nope, same thing
2007-08-21T14:58:00.000Z	tigran	HighNo	yes, ping works
2007-08-21T14:58:00.000Z	HighNo	tigran	- hm, maybe there is some proxy setting in your browser?
2007-08-21T14:59:00.000Z	tigran	HighNo	I dont use proxies
2007-08-21T14:59:00.000Z	HighNo	tigran	that's what might cause the problem - just check it...
2007-08-21T15:02:00.000Z	tigran	HighNo	no proxy, direct connection to internet in firefox
2007-08-21T15:04:00.000Z	HighNo	tigran	do you have nmap installed?
2007-08-21T15:05:00.000Z	tigran	HighNo	I dont think so
2007-08-21T15:05:00.000Z	HighNo	tigran	correct
2007-08-21T15:06:00.000Z	tigran	HighNo	Won't download, stuck at 0%
2007-08-21T15:07:00.000Z	tigran	HighNo	I just re-did it and worked second time, nmap installed, what do I do now?
2007-08-21T15:08:00.000Z	HighNo	tigran	that sounds odd again - one time working - next time not
2007-08-21T15:08:00.000Z	tigran	HighNo	I know, its completly random
2007-08-21T15:09:00.000Z	HighNo	tigran	I would have wanted to check whether the connection doesn't even initialize or if the connection just doesnt transfer data
2007-08-21T15:11:00.000Z	HighNo	tigran	very odd that is...
2007-08-21T15:11:00.000Z	tigran	HighNo	Can the problem be from my router itself?
2007-08-21T15:12:00.000Z	HighNo	tigran	of course it could be not correctly routing your requests - even more so because it does NAT too but to test that you would need another pc
