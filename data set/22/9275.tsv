2005-01-16T15:15:00.000Z	jmob		classpath is compatable with JDK 1.0 supposedly :)
2005-01-16T08:37:00.000Z	jmob		Have I broken my packages somehow? http://rafb.net/paste/results/icRwSD65.html
2005-01-16T08:37:00.000Z	jmob		Seems all of the dev related X packages depend on 4.3.0.dfsg.1-6ubuntu25 but I have 4.3.0.dfsg.1-6ubuntu25.1 stuff installed.
2005-01-16T08:38:00.000Z	ogra	jmob	is your universe enabled ?
2005-01-16T08:38:00.000Z	jmob	ogra	yes
2005-01-16T08:44:00.000Z	ogra	jmob	you shouldnt mix debian with ubuntu.....
2005-01-16T08:45:00.000Z	jmob	ogra	yes, I'm aware
2005-01-16T08:45:00.000Z	ogra	jmob	for the worst case you could compile the packages from the debian source with ubuntu dependencys
2005-01-16T08:45:00.000Z	jmob	ogra	however, there were serveral packages that weren't present anywhere on ubuntu, afaict
2005-01-16T08:46:00.000Z	ogra	jmob	mplayer for example is in multiverse....what else did you miss ?
2005-01-16T08:47:00.000Z	jmob	ogra	I'm probably just mistaken, I don't think I had multiverse in my sources.list at the time.
2005-01-16T08:48:00.000Z	ogra	jmob	ubuntu is a 100% sync from sid....even if some packages dont build, you will still have 99% of them available ;)
2005-01-16T08:49:00.000Z	jmob	ogra	Yes, it seems like mixing the two will eventually cause very bad dependancy problems.
2005-01-16T08:50:00.000Z	ogra	jmob	a bug ? about what ?
2005-01-16T08:50:00.000Z	jmob	ogra	I can't install any dev packages, my orginal question :)
2005-01-16T08:51:00.000Z	jmob	ogra	any dev packages related to X at least
2005-01-16T08:51:00.000Z	ogra	jmob	its clearly not supported to mix the distros....
2005-01-16T08:51:00.000Z	jmob	ogra	yes, but I don't think that caused the problem
2005-01-16T08:51:00.000Z	ogra	jmob	so what app do you want to blame for that ?
2005-01-16T08:51:00.000Z	jmob	ogra	eh?
2005-01-16T08:52:00.000Z	ogra	jmob	if you got a bug you need to assign it to an app....so you want to blame apt/synaptic for mixing up your repo lists ?
2005-01-16T08:54:00.000Z	jmob	ogra	Not exactly! I think all the dev packages need to be updated to reflect the version change from 4.3.0.dfsg.1-6ubuntu25 to 4.3.0.dfsg.1-6ubuntu25.1
