2007-04-22T14:21:00.000Z	brunoUT		how did that person do that with the taskbar on the bottom?
2007-04-22T14:21:00.000Z	mlgx	brunoUT	: I guess it's simply a background image
2007-04-22T14:22:00.000Z	brunoUT		what?
2007-04-22T14:22:00.000Z	brunoUT		im talkin about the taskbar

2007-04-22T14:22:00.000Z	brunoUT		how did he do that?
2007-04-22T14:22:00.000Z	mlgx	brunoUT	: right click on it > properties > appearance, there you can choose to use a background for it
2007-04-22T14:23:00.000Z	mlgx	brunoUT	: with a good png image, you can obtain a good rendering of the taskbar :)
2007-04-22T14:23:00.000Z	brunoUT	mlgx	there is no properties when i right click....just appearance and there is nothing there to make it look like that
2007-04-22T14:23:00.000Z	mlgx	brunoUT	: or maybe a theme, I don't know evrey of them but I guess there are some very stylish ones
