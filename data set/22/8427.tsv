2007-08-10T05:29:00.000Z	dresden		OK Sauvin and LiberCogito and others, heres my new plan, please tell me if its a good idea OK?? 1) wipe the whole HDD and load my working Win2kPro NTFS backup on the WHOLE drive (as i normally do),  2) Defrag the HELL out of it,  3) shrink NTFS and create 42 GB free space,  4) create a 30 GB FAT32 space,  and 4) then create a 12 GB free space for ubuntu  5) install ubuntu,  6) use FAT32 to transfer files inbetween OS ??????
2007-08-10T05:29:00.000Z	dresden		 good idea??
2007-08-10T05:30:00.000Z	Chousuke	dresden	Ubuntu can safely write files to NTFS
2007-08-10T05:30:00.000Z	Chousuke	dresden	with ntfs-3g
2007-08-10T05:30:00.000Z	Chousuke	dresden	it's safe. You don't need fat32
2007-08-10T12:32:00.000Z	Chousuke	dresden	no, no.
2007-08-10T12:32:00.000Z	Chousuke	dresden	usually NTFS (and FAT) drives are mounted with root-only permissions
2007-08-10T12:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	dresden	you need to manually specify permissions if you want a non-root user to access it.
2007-08-10T12:35:00.000Z	Chousuke	dresden	You'll want to specify a umask for the mounted fat or ntfs drives.
2007-08-10T12:35:00.000Z	Chousuke	dresden	Honestly, I don't know why ubuntu defaults to root-only permisisons
2007-08-10T12:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	dresden	umask means the permissions you give to the mounted drive.
2007-08-10T12:37:00.000Z	Chousuke	dresden	I'm assuming you're unable to write to a drive that you mounted? is that ntfs or fat?
2007-08-10T12:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	dresden	open the terminal and type "mount"
2007-08-10T12:42:00.000Z	Chousuke	dresden	gnome should automount them for you
