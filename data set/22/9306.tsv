2005-08-24T10:23:00.000Z	thezombiehunter		can anyone help me
2005-08-24T10:25:00.000Z	DonL	thezombiehunter	you're looking at two different systems. They have different plusses and minuses. I prefer Linux personally, and I'll deal with the game thing as it comes
2005-08-24T10:26:00.000Z	DonL	thezombiehunter	the best way to turn someone off of something is to try too hard to convince them. Linux is something people come to, something not sold to people
2005-08-24T10:29:00.000Z	DonL	thezombiehunter	was sound working with SB?
2005-08-24T10:31:00.000Z	DonL	thezombiehunter	reboot?
2005-08-24T10:33:00.000Z	DonL	thezombiehunter	I had problems with the onboard system I had, but I put a SB live card in and it fixed it. Probably could have made the other work if I'd tried harder
2005-08-24T10:34:00.000Z	DonL	thezombiehunter	are the volumes turned up? I know that sounds stupid, but I've done that myself a few times
2005-08-24T10:37:00.000Z	DonL	thezombiehunter	can you beg borrow or steal another sb card? That was my fix, I don't know about you.
2005-08-24T10:38:00.000Z	DonL	thezombiehunter	so you got it working?
2005-08-24T10:48:00.000Z	DonL	thezombiehunter	you're welcome. Glad to help
2005-08-24T10:50:00.000Z	DonL	thezombiehunter	go to the Ubuntu site and check out the wiki and the help stuff. It's all there
2005-08-24T10:51:00.000Z	DonL	thezombiehunter	it's been a while since I've done it. But that's where I found the answers
2005-08-24T10:53:00.000Z	DonL	thezombiehunter	it's the only card I've found that works all the time for me
