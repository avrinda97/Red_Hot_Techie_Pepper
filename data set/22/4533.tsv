2007-12-13T21:42:00.000Z	XiXaQ	loke_	I can't find that in synaptic?
2007-12-13T21:43:00.000Z	loke_	XiXaQ	It's not in synaptic, as far as I know.
2007-12-13T21:43:00.000Z	loke_	XiXaQ	The link I pointed you to has packages.
2007-12-13T21:43:00.000Z	XiXaQ		it looks nice, but it's not the one I was looking for.

2007-12-13T21:44:00.000Z	loke_		That looks like UPS, just cut down.
2007-12-13T21:51:00.000Z	XiXaQ	loke_	:( whah, why can't people use a bugtracker instead of having a thousand pages of forum posts that you have to browse through?
2007-12-13T21:52:00.000Z	loke_	XiXaQ	People are impatient. ;)
2007-12-13T21:52:00.000Z	XiXaQ		loke_? It's alot faster to use launchpad than it is to manually sift through each bug manually every time.
2007-12-13T21:53:00.000Z	XiXaQ	loke_	I was completely unable to find the deb for it, because I don't have the time to browse the hundreds of threads and posts and fine-read it for a link.
