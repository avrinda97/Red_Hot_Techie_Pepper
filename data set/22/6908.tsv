2006-06-25T12:53:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1		yo! I have a problem with my upgrade... little help?
2006-06-25T12:55:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1		anyone know why all my programs quit the moment I type in a dialogue box like admin password or gaim chat box?
2006-06-25T12:57:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1		anyone had problems with their keyboard after upgrading to dapper from breezy?
2006-06-25T12:59:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1		anyone... anyone at all?
2006-06-25T13:00:00.000Z	jenda	monomaniacpa1	can you describethe problem?
2006-06-25T13:01:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1	jenda	whenever I type in a dialogue box like a admin passwd for example, the program quits.
2006-06-25T13:03:00.000Z	jenda	monomaniacpa1	that's probably not a keyboard problem - could you be more specific?
2006-06-25T13:03:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1		If I typed a message in this dialogue box the program would quit/disappear.
2006-06-25T13:04:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1		*I am using a PC atm*
2006-06-25T13:05:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1		it only started after I changed some settings under the Keyboard GUI. I have put them back (I hope) to no avail.
2006-06-25T13:11:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1	jenda	any ideas
2006-06-25T13:12:00.000Z	jenda	monomaniacpa1	please be more specific: what program was it that quit - what did you have to do to make it quit - what do you mean by using a PC ATM?
2006-06-25T13:13:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1	jenda	any program with a text entry box. Specifically gaim and when I try to enter the admin password for programs like synaptic.  I am using a PC AT THE MOMENT
2006-06-25T13:14:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1		as soon as I touch a letter or number on my keyboard the program quits
2006-06-25T13:14:00.000Z	jenda	monomaniacpa1	oh ok... and what do you mean by PC - x86?
2006-06-25T13:15:00.000Z	jenda	monomaniacpa1	not sure... are there any places where the kbd works fine?
2006-06-25T13:16:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1		firefox. But that now quits within five seconds for no apparent reason, without touching a key
2006-06-25T13:18:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1		OK problems worse than I thought - most programs won't open or when they do, they quit within a few seconds of opening.
2006-06-25T13:18:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1		plus the homefile opens often making me suspect it was to do with kbd shortcuts
2006-06-25T13:27:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1	jenda	I now have firefox open without it quitting, by changing keyboard to generic. No other programs will open/remain open, however.
2006-06-25T13:29:00.000Z	jenda	monomaniacpa1	no idea, sorry. maybe a key is stuck.
2006-06-25T13:30:00.000Z	monomaniacpa1	jenda	thats what I would have guessed but the laptops built in kbd doesn't work either.
