2010-05-01T10:04:00.000Z	Guest10713		hi guys, question: when i "make" i get this error "make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1" any clues as to what packages i need?
2010-05-01T10:05:00.000Z	undecim	Guest10713	Can you put the last several lines that output onto http://paste.ubuntu.com/ , and then paste the link back here?
2010-05-01T10:05:00.000Z	Guest10713	undecim	sure
2010-05-01T10:06:00.000Z	Guest10713	undecim	http://paste.ubuntu.com/425677/
2010-05-01T10:09:00.000Z	undecim	Guest10713	Well, I don't see anything in that output that tells me if you are missing anything.
2010-05-01T10:10:00.000Z	undecim	Guest10713	Although I'll point out that quakeforge has a repository for debian/ubuntu if you are using i386 (32-bit)
2010-05-01T10:10:00.000Z	Guest10713	undecim	omg no way
2010-05-01T10:11:00.000Z	Guest10713	undecim	whats it called exactaly?
2010-05-01T10:11:00.000Z	undecim	Guest10713	looks like it's a version behind though.
2010-05-01T10:11:00.000Z	undecim	Guest10713	It's on the download page at http://www.quakeforge.net/files.php
2010-05-01T10:12:00.000Z	Guest10713	undecim	awww yeah i saw that one allready
2010-05-01T10:12:00.000Z	Guest10713	undecim	thanks for your help though
2010-05-01T10:14:00.000Z	undecim	Guest10713	In the INSTALL file in the source download lists the packages you should have. Make sure you have the "-dev" packages of each one that is available.
2010-05-01T10:15:00.000Z	Guest10713	undecim	ok ill look again
2010-05-01T10:16:00.000Z	Guest10713	undecim	ive been chasing this for a few hours now
2010-05-01T10:17:00.000Z	undecim	Guest10713	My guess is you are missing the Ogg Vorbis package, since you failed in the sound folder. Do you have libogg-dev?
2010-05-01T10:17:00.000Z	Guest10713	undecim	gettin it now
2010-05-01T10:19:00.000Z	Guest10713	undecim	no luck after that one
2010-05-01T10:20:00.000Z	undecim	Guest10713	Any change in the output?
2010-05-01T10:21:00.000Z	Guest10713	undecim	nope, i may just try the old version, its funny they give you the "deb" to add to get it with apt but they dont tell you what they call it exactaly
2010-05-01T10:23:00.000Z	undecim	Guest10713	Googling around, it looks like this has been a problem since edgy.
2010-05-01T10:25:00.000Z	Guest10713	undecim	well thanks for the help man, im gonna give up and turn in tonight, thanks!
