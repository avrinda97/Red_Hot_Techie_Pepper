2005-05-23T15:50:00.000Z	_hp_		anyone here got the logitech media keyboard buttons to work?
2005-05-23T15:50:00.000Z	_hp_		my ubuntu works swell
2005-05-23T15:51:00.000Z	_hp_		[X-Pro] DarkGhost, that's pretty annoying
2005-05-23T15:52:00.000Z	_hp_		so, is there any utility that will let me pogram my keyboard because i've got special buttons
2005-05-23T15:52:00.000Z	_hp_		this isn't #uberaolhaxors [X-Pro] DarkGhost
2005-05-23T15:53:00.000Z	_hp_		any ops around?
2005-05-23T15:53:00.000Z	_hp_		ajmitch_, bob2, crimsun, daniels, tritium ?
2005-05-23T15:54:00.000Z	_hp_		-[X-Pro] DarkGhost- VERSION mIRC v6.16 Khaled Mardam-Bey
2005-05-23T15:54:00.000Z	_hp_		i didn't know mIRC ran on ubuntu
2005-05-23T15:56:00.000Z	_hp_		seems ubuntu is not really meant for servers, but for people who want to use linux as their desktop
2005-05-23T15:56:00.000Z	topyli	_hp_	it's just as well for a server. pretty much like debian
2005-05-23T15:58:00.000Z	topyli	_hp_	depening on the type of server, you may want something with a longer life time than ubuntu (debian, rhle/clones)...
2005-05-23T15:59:00.000Z	topyli	_hp_	by life time i mean release cycle of course :)
2005-05-23T15:59:00.000Z	_hp_	topyli	my server came with redhat enterprise and i never bothered to change it... it just works
2005-05-23T15:59:00.000Z	topyli	_hp_	exactly
2005-05-23T15:59:00.000Z	_hp_	topyli	although if i ever wanted to change it i would probably install gentoo on it
2005-05-23T16:00:00.000Z	topyli	_hp_	too unpredictable :)
2005-05-24T16:00:00.000Z	_hp_	topyli	although you go a weeny bit faster
2005-05-24T16:00:00.000Z	_hp_	topyli	if not gentoo, then freebsd
2005-05-24T16:01:00.000Z	topyli	_hp_	yeah. i guess the bsd's would be nice too, but i've not messed with them
2005-05-24T16:02:00.000Z	_hp_	topyli	i've ran it for a limited amount of time, it was nice, but not as a desktop. best *nix desktop i've seen is ubuntu, and mac os x
2005-05-24T16:09:00.000Z	topyli	_hp_	there's no development stuff on the cd. it's in the main repository still
