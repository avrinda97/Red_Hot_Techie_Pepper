2005-04-22T06:36:00.000Z	Xgates		anyone compiled their kernel, for the life of me I have all the correct settings for my hardware but this thing keeps doing a panic on install, I need someone to look at this .config I did and see if anyone can see the problem
2005-04-22T06:37:00.000Z	Xgates		lol
2005-04-22T06:39:00.000Z	Xgates		all I can think is that Ubuntu is setup that is needs [ ]  Power Management support  compiled in
2005-04-22T06:40:00.000Z	Xgates		that is./it ....
2005-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	Xgates		YEs of course and SO I can learn how this distro is working
2005-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	Xgates		I'm a hands on guy
2005-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	Xgates		hehe
2005-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	Xgates		but this is getting WAY out of hand here
2005-04-22T06:42:00.000Z	Xgates		no one in here has compiled their kernel?
2005-04-22T06:42:00.000Z	saik0	Xgates	I used to run gentoo
2005-04-22T07:24:00.000Z	saik0	Xgates	what 'restricted modules' are you using
2005-04-22T07:26:00.000Z	Xgates	saik0	ok I didnt install any so I need them for the k7 image?
2005-04-22T07:26:00.000Z	saik0	Xgates	I think you want this package linux-restricted-modules-2.6.10-5-k7
2005-04-22T07:26:00.000Z	Xgates	saik0	there wasnt any of them installed btw
2005-04-22T07:27:00.000Z	saik0	Xgates	actually linux-restricted-modules-k7 is a metapackage that will depend on the latest one
2005-04-22T07:29:00.000Z	Xgates	saik0	all I see it say is linux-restricted-modules-k7 2.6.10-7
2005-04-22T07:30:00.000Z	Xgates	saik0	I dont see any linux-restricted-modules-2.6.10-5-k7
2005-04-22T07:32:00.000Z	saik0	Xgates	do you have the restricted repo in your apt sources? I think it comes enabled by default. Updated from Warty or Hoary install
2005-04-22T07:33:00.000Z	Xgates	saik0	I found it doing apt-cache search, just couldnt seem to find it in Synaptic
2005-04-22T07:35:00.000Z	Xgates	saik0	ahh its under Misc Text based in Synaptic
2005-04-22T08:14:00.000Z	Xgates	saik0	forgot if I said thanks but that worked :-)
2005-04-22T08:14:00.000Z	saik0	Xgates	yep, glad I could help
