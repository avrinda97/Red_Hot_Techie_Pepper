2007-01-24T17:16:00.000Z	TheVault		Thanks DARKGuy
2007-01-24T17:17:00.000Z	TheVault		Alright, my Ubuntu 6.10 just finished downloading, lemme burn it on a disc and lemme dual boot on my laptop for the first time(this is taking a big step for me because I test everything on my desktop first)...Wish me luck guys
2007-01-24T17:18:00.000Z	TheVault		wait a sec, the Ubuntu 6.10 i jus downloaded, is that a LIVE CD also?
2007-01-24T17:20:00.000Z	TheVault		I just downloaded Ubuntu 6.10, is that also a Live CD when I go to burn it?
2007-01-24T17:21:00.000Z	TheVault		no, its an ISO file thats going to be burned to a DVD since I have no blank CDs
2007-01-24T17:22:00.000Z	TheVault		Can I use a DVD to burn Ubuntu 6.10 to and install it?
2007-01-24T06:24:00.000Z	TheVault		I got a question on which option I should check. I am at the installation screen on Ubuntu 6.10. I just made a new partition(well I resized my C: which has Xp on it.) I have 13gig unallocated space....which option should I check at the installer to put Linux on the unallocated?
2007-01-24T06:24:00.000Z	TheVault		if you need the options let me know
2007-01-24T06:26:00.000Z	TheVault		I need one on help with how to install linux
2007-01-24T06:26:00.000Z	TheVault		*one on one help
2007-01-24T06:26:00.000Z	Flannel	TheVault	which installer are you using? Desktop CD (liveCD) or Alternate CD (textmode)?
2007-01-24T06:27:00.000Z	Flannel	TheVault	you just do a normal installation, and you'll need to format that 13 gigs for linux to use them (that's in the installer), do you have a particular set of options you're unsure about? (having myself not used the liveCD installer in... forever)
2007-03-03T15:35:00.000Z	Flannel	TheVault	that depends on what you mean by 'KDE'
2007-03-03T15:35:00.000Z	TheVault	Flannel	What do you mean?
2007-03-03T15:35:00.000Z	Flannel	TheVault	do you just want Kubuntu installed?  Or, You want the 'official' KDE (which has some differences from Kubuntu), or do you just want a minimal KDE WM?
2007-03-03T15:37:00.000Z	Flannel	TheVault	ubuntu and kubuntu are both Ubuntu, the former two are desktop environments, and  you can have htem both insalled on the same Ubuntu system
2007-03-03T15:37:00.000Z	Flannel	TheVault	install the 'kubuntu-desktop' package, to get Kubuntu
2007-03-03T15:37:00.000Z	TheVault	Flannel	How would I do that then?
2007-03-03T15:38:00.000Z	Flannel	TheVault	yep.  You choose between them when you login
2007-03-03T15:39:00.000Z	Flannel	TheVault	nope.  They both sit on the same Ubuntu (the distro) installation
2007-03-03T15:39:00.000Z	Flannel	TheVault	install 'kubuntu-desktop'
2007-03-03T15:41:00.000Z	Flannel	TheVault	no, that's just dualboot.  Ubuntu (the distro, where you can run Ubuntu (the DE) or Kubuntu (the DE)) and Windows
