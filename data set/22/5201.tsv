2007-07-11T08:13:00.000Z	astro76	dissection	with ntfs-3g it's not risky
2007-07-11T08:13:00.000Z	dissection	astro76	Okay, thats what I was using :)
2007-07-11T08:13:00.000Z	astro76	dissection	only risky to enable write with the old driver, and then only to the partition you're writing.. but anyway
2007-07-14T09:36:00.000Z	astro76	dissection	0.5.5 is for ntfs-config only
2007-07-14T09:37:00.000Z	dissection	astro76	Oh? So which one should I use, ntfs-config, or ntfs-3g?
2007-07-14T09:37:00.000Z	astro76	dissection	ntfs-config is a configuration utility for ntfs-3g
2007-07-14T09:38:00.000Z	dissection	astro76	Ah, I see. I just checked synaptic, and it says the installed version is 1:1.328-1, if I do an apt-get ntfs-3g, will it upgrade it to the latest stable one?
2007-07-14T09:39:00.000Z	astro76	dissection	that is the latest in feisty
2007-07-14T09:39:00.000Z	dissection	astro76	So should I just leave it as it is, or is it recommended that I download it from the website and compile it?
2007-07-14T09:39:00.000Z	astro76	dissection	leave it it works fine
2007-07-14T09:40:00.000Z	dissection	astro76	Okay :), just needed to be sure that the one I have is stable too, so I can make sure I won't suffer any dataloss ;D~
2007-07-14T09:41:00.000Z	astro76	dissection	if you notice on the website 1.328 is only from this March, also any security or critical updates will be provided by apt-get update
2007-07-17T10:43:00.000Z	dissection	astro76	rpm as in the files will be with .rpm extension?
2007-07-17T10:44:00.000Z	astro76	dissection	if it's for fedora or redhat I'm assuming theyre .rpm
2007-07-17T10:49:00.000Z	dissection	astro76	there are no .rpm files, and the README file says I have to type "sh install" to install it. What kind of file needs that command?
2007-07-18T06:55:00.000Z	astro76	dissection	adding it to .bashrc makes it permanent

2007-07-20T05:37:00.000Z	dissection	astro76	Saw that link already. I'm connected through a router though.
2007-09-26T09:02:00.000Z	astro76	dissection	you need the alternate cd to install on raid
2007-09-26T09:03:00.000Z	dissection	astro76	If I install it on either of my drives, will I lose my existing OS?
2007-09-26T09:03:00.000Z	astro76	dissection	I'm sure it would destroy your raid, obviously
2007-09-26T09:09:00.000Z	dissection	astro76	If I install dmraid, will it still mess up my Windows installation?
