2008-12-03T11:41:00.000Z	Sierradump		Where can I find the temperature of my room...
2008-12-03T11:41:00.000Z	Sierradump		*haha I mean processsor?
2008-12-03T11:43:00.000Z	rlt	Sierradump	if arrenlex's suggestion doesn't work, look into lm_sensors
2008-12-03T11:43:00.000Z	rlt	Sierradump	sorry, lm-sensors **
2008-12-03T11:44:00.000Z	rlt	Sierradump	if you go the lm-sensors route, there's a gnome panel applet for it in package sensors-applet
2008-12-03T11:45:00.000Z	rlt	Sierradump	probably a command line thingie for it too, but I don't know it off the top of my head
2008-12-03T11:45:00.000Z	Sierradump	rlt	 so do I have do download the sensors applet?
2008-12-03T11:46:00.000Z	rlt	Sierradump	if you want to use it, yeah. It's sensors-applet in the repos.
2008-12-03T11:47:00.000Z	Sierradump	rlt	 looking for sensors-applet
2008-12-03T12:00:00.000Z	rlt	Sierradump	Issue "sudo sensors-detect", hit YES to every question, then do "sudo /etc/init.d/module-init-tools", then do "sudo sensors -s", then it should be set up right
2008-12-03T12:01:00.000Z	rlt	Sierradump	once it's set up, "sensors" to see temps from the command line, or if you installed the applet, add "Hardware Sensors Applet" to your panel.
2008-12-03T12:12:00.000Z	Sierradump	rlt	 when I type in sensors I get 4 "core" temperatures -  Core0 Temp:  27* c  / Core0 Temp: 26* c / Core1 Temp:  33* c  / Core1 Temp: 28* c
2008-12-03T12:12:00.000Z	Sierradump	rlt	 Does that look right?
2008-12-03T12:14:00.000Z	rlt	Sierradump	not sure why you have two of each Core... I'm guessing you're on a dual-core machine, though, which is why you have Core0 and Core1.
2008-12-03T12:15:00.000Z	rlt	Sierradump	here's the output of sensors on my machine, for comparison: http://pastebin.com/f72acc5ed
2008-12-03T12:15:00.000Z	Sierradump	rlt	 10-4  -- just installed a dual core processor!
2008-12-03T12:16:00.000Z	Sierradump	rlt	 Here is my pastebin of my sensors output:  http://pastebin.com/m3d68bd43   What do you think?
2008-12-03T12:19:00.000Z	rlt	Sierradump	not sure why you have two sensors per core, but agree with arrenlex on that. The temperatures look about right, esp. if you're not running CPU-intensive stuff right now.
2008-12-03T12:24:00.000Z	Sierradump	rlt	/ arrenlex :  No cpu intensive applications... Just Xchat and a couple firefox windows, skype, and a terminal :)  Computer doesn't seem to be running any faster (but does show dual core)... Went from MK-36 single core 2.0ghz to TL-60 dual core 2.0ghz.
2008-12-03T12:25:00.000Z	Sierradump	rlt	/ arrenlex:  just wanted to make sure I put the thermal paste on correctly :)  Had to ditch factory thermal "pad" in lieu of some thermal paste I had lying around!
2008-12-03T12:25:00.000Z	rlt	Sierradump	hah! Yeah, those temps look fine :)
2008-12-03T12:33:00.000Z	Sierradump	rlt	 just downloaded "gkrellm"  and that shows 4 random temps and 1 cpu temp.  Cpu temp is 51* C so I am thinking processor isn't "cold" but also isn't OVERHEATING!
