2006-04-19T05:01:00.000Z	Seveas	harisund	yes, we're on this half
2006-04-19T05:02:00.000Z	harisund	Seveas	Oh ok .. I see.. thanks ..picture is kind of bit more clear now ..
2006-04-19T05:06:00.000Z	Seveas	harisund	other side of the split
2006-04-19T05:06:00.000Z	harisund	Seveas	Ah I get it .. ok .. just curious ..
2006-05-19T10:45:00.000Z	harisund	Seveas	that page only takes me to a mailing list email. Where can I get the iso's from?
2006-05-19T10:46:00.000Z	Seveas	harisund	the latter part "join #ubuntu+1 for discussion and support"
2006-07-11T16:05:00.000Z	Seveas	harisund	it'll only work with the nx 1.5 client
2006-07-11T16:08:00.000Z	Seveas	harisund	first get it working with the nomachine key...
2006-07-11T16:08:00.000Z	harisund	Seveas	how do I get it working? I mean, how do I check, the thing is I have a Ubuntu server and a Windows client.
2006-07-11T16:12:00.000Z	harisund	Seveas	thanks for your help ... it also appears NoMachine have a free .deb of NX server 2.0 on their web site .. I am going to try that out as well :)
2006-07-11T11:53:00.000Z	harisund	Seveas	I don't know if you are around .. but FreeNX server from your repos work just fine with absolutely no configuration, from a Windows client as long as i am using client version 1.5 and not 2.0 .. thanks a ton for that .. do you know whether the NX will work if I have something other than Gnome? Say XFCE?
2006-08-03T15:59:00.000Z	Seveas	harisund	correct
2006-08-21T10:34:00.000Z	Seveas	harisund	install dhcp3-server and get that working on the local net, then come back for nat ;)
2006-08-21T10:34:00.000Z	harisund	Seveas	I see, so dhcp3-server installs that. Can I configure it to be a DHCP server on only eth1 and not eth0 (since eth0 is public, to the modem, and eth1 is to the switch, my local LAN)
2006-08-21T10:34:00.000Z	Seveas	harisund	yes
2006-08-23T12:16:00.000Z	Seveas	harisund	-c
