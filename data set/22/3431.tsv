2009-02-18T08:45:00.000Z	hlm		how do I end a program that was opened in a terminal, that has no GUI?
2009-02-18T08:45:00.000Z	redvamp128	hlm	 goto system- administration- system monitor- then process tab and find it in the list-- then right click choose kill task
2009-02-18T08:45:00.000Z	hlm	redvamp128	its not in the list
2009-02-18T08:46:00.000Z	hlm	redvamp128	metasploit framework web gui
2009-02-18T08:47:00.000Z	redvamp128	hlm	 is it still open on your desktop ?
2009-02-18T08:47:00.000Z	hlm	redvamp128	no
2009-02-18T09:15:00.000Z	redvamp128	hlm	 I know the simple way to kill it-- just ctl-alt-backspace then log back in and the process should be stopped
2009-02-18T09:15:00.000Z	hlm	redvamp128	no thanks, I dont want to restore all my running apps
2009-02-21T06:34:00.000Z	redvamp128	hlm	 packages has that file (though you may find your self in dependency trolling) Ubuntu -- Package Search Results -- libxvidcore4 <http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libxvidcore4&amp;searchon=names&amp;suite=all&amp;section=all>
2009-02-21T06:34:00.000Z	hlm	redvamp128	I have already installed it and since then restarted
2009-02-21T06:34:00.000Z	redvamp128	hlm	 I would also grab the -dev one also
2009-02-21T06:35:00.000Z	redvamp128	hlm	 it could be that it ran out of room to say that is what it needed.
2009-02-21T06:36:00.000Z	hlm	redvamp128	I have about 16 gigs left on my hard drve
2009-02-21T06:36:00.000Z	redvamp128	hlm	 Not room on your hard drive but in the dependency -- for example it ran out of room to say libxvidcore4-dev (where it ran out of room to display the -dev)
2009-02-21T06:37:00.000Z	hlm	redvamp128	I got ya now, thanks
2009-02-21T06:37:00.000Z	redvamp128	hlm	 since it appears as though you are trying to install the xvid-dev (development)
2009-02-21T06:38:00.000Z	hlm	redvamp128	what is my best bet of fixing this, it has to be dev since I have the notdev version of it
2009-02-21T06:40:00.000Z	redvamp128	hlm	 what are you trying to install/do?
2009-02-21T06:41:00.000Z	hlm	redvamp128	I am trying to install linux video convertor for psp more info at:  https://sourceforge.net/projects/pspvc/
