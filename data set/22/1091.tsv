2011-05-01T07:50:00.000Z	MadRobot	KM0201	how do I use the panel-indicators?
2011-05-01T07:51:00.000Z	MadRobot	KM0201	where do I find them?
2011-05-01T07:51:00.000Z	KM0201		Maddogm: on unity?.. you install them from synaptic.. if you mean the panel applets, they don't wrk on unity, you have to be using gnome classic
2011-05-01T07:52:00.000Z	KM0201		Maddogm: i think you can create a panel.. and add the panel applets to it.. but th top panel.. you won't be able to add applets to it... unless they are indicator applets
2011-05-01T07:53:00.000Z	MadRobot	KM0201	oh, I see. That's quite disappointing if you ask me. Thanks though.
2011-05-01T07:53:00.000Z	KM0201	MadRobot	Gnome is getting away from the panel applets, and moving towards indicator applets.. it's honestly not surprising...
2011-05-01T07:53:00.000Z	MadRobot	KM0201	how do I add them to the indicator?
2011-05-01T07:54:00.000Z	KM0201	MadRobot	if an indicator applet is available.. msot fo the time, you install them from synaptic
2011-05-01T07:54:00.000Z	KM0201		someone kick that clown
2011-05-01T07:54:00.000Z	MadRobot	KM0201	no need to add anything at all?
2011-05-01T07:55:00.000Z	KM0201	MadRobot	nope.. just install them in synaptic, and it will get added to the indicator applet tray (up by the clock)
2011-05-01T07:58:00.000Z	MadRobot	KM0201	It's not about the indicator-applets themselves. What actually disappointing is having to add them from Synaptic (or the terminal).
2011-05-01T07:58:00.000Z	KM0201	MadRobot	i agree.. i always kinda liked "right clicking the panel" and adding them.
2011-05-01T07:58:00.000Z	KM0201		made it simple
2011-05-01T07:59:00.000Z	KM0201	MadRobot	not to mention, some of the panel applets, have not been properly implemented into indicator applets yet (like system monitor)
2011-05-01T07:59:00.000Z	MadRobot	KM0201	thanks to this issue alone, I assure you that quite many of those who interested in Ubuntu will walk away from just because of that.
2011-05-01T08:00:00.000Z	KM0201	MadRobot	maybe.. it'll just take some adjusting to... unity kept giving my machine issues, so i just switched to xfce, which is similar enough to ubuntu.
2011-05-01T08:00:00.000Z	KM0201		classic gnome
2011-05-01T08:01:00.000Z	MadRobot	KM0201	I think I might do the same. :\
2011-05-01T08:01:00.000Z	KM0201	MadRobot	xfce4 is slick.. i like it... disable compositing, and its very fast (or if you've got a newer PC, it'll be fast w/ it)
2011-05-01T08:01:00.000Z	KM0201	MadRobot	but its not as user friendly as gnome.. but i have used it before, and like it
2011-05-01T08:02:00.000Z	MadRobot	KM0201	Yeah,
