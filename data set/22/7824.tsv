2006-01-19T12:55:00.000Z	gpled	Nightwind	scsi cd should work
2006-01-19T12:55:00.000Z	Nightwind	gpled	the BIOS doesn't allow booting from SCSI
2006-01-19T12:56:00.000Z	gpled	Nightwind	you can get a disk, that will do that for you
2006-01-19T12:57:00.000Z	gpled	Nightwind	a floppy disk
2006-01-19T12:58:00.000Z	gpled	Nightwind	you boot off a floppy, that in turn boots off the cd
2006-01-19T13:00:00.000Z	gpled	Nightwind	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SmartBootManagerHowto
2006-01-19T13:01:00.000Z	Nightwind	gpled	I have been there
2006-01-19T13:01:00.000Z	Nightwind	gpled	that doesn't tell me how to put Ubuntu on floppys
2006-01-19T13:02:00.000Z	gpled	Nightwind	the file you are tying to put on a floppy is to big.  it will not fit.
2006-01-19T13:03:00.000Z	Nightwind	gpled	I understand that but there should be some way to span mutiple floppies
2006-01-19T13:04:00.000Z	gpled	Nightwind	you can, but you would have to brake it up, and then you can not run the code
2006-01-19T13:05:00.000Z	gpled	Nightwind	have you also looked in your scsi controler at boot up?
2006-01-19T13:07:00.000Z	gpled	Nightwind	how big is your hard drive?
