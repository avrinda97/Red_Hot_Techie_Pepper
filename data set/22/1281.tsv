2010-07-22T00:55:00.000Z	fablinix	justin_	just install ubuntu-restricted-extra from the software center, it includes flash along with other things you usually need
2010-07-22T01:00:00.000Z	fablinix	justin_	I had to run this script on one of my computers: http://www.myscienceisbetter.info/install-native-64bit-flash-player-10-on-linux.html
2010-07-22T01:01:00.000Z	justin_	fablinix	ill try it if this next thing does not work
2010-07-22T01:01:00.000Z	fablinix	justin_	ok, flash can be a pain in the ... sometimes in linux :(
2010-07-22T01:10:00.000Z	fablinix	justin_	right under the title, "You are using Ubuntu XX.XX"
2010-07-22T01:12:00.000Z	fablinix	justin_	you could also run lsb_release -a in a terminal
2010-07-22T01:15:00.000Z	fablinix	justin_	oh you are after that, run uname -a
2010-07-22T01:16:00.000Z	fablinix	justin_	try the script I linked before, just save it somewhere and run it, it should do everything for you, if that doesn't work then I don't know
2010-07-22T01:18:00.000Z	fablinix	justin_	http://www.myscienceisbetter.info/flash-player/native-64bit-flash-installer.sh and after you've downloaded it, right click » properties » permissions » tick allow executing file as program, and then double click the file
2010-07-22T01:24:00.000Z	fablinix	justin_	still not working?
2010-07-22T01:28:00.000Z	fablinix	justin_	aw :( I don't know then, that script fixed my issues
2010-07-22T01:42:00.000Z	fablinix	justin_	Opera and Chromium are good
