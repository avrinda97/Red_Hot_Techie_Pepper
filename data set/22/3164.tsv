2009-08-05T10:06:00.000Z	Shu		Can someone help me?
2009-08-05T10:08:00.000Z	Shu		I need to know how to install stuff! Ubuntu is so confusing! Like, when I click install to install the newest version of firefox (or any program for that matter) i'll select run and it will auto choose the program to run it with, then I get an error when I try to run it. Also, the plugins that I need to watch videos from youtube etc. won't download
2009-08-05T10:09:00.000Z	Shu		For what, shoving sticks up orifices?
2009-08-05T10:09:00.000Z	mezquitale	Shu	one step at a time please, first which program would you like to install?
2009-08-05T10:12:00.000Z	mezquitale	Shu	first go to "software sources" in "System-->Administration" and enable universe, restricted, and multiverse
2009-08-05T10:12:00.000Z	mezquitale	Shu	xchat-gnome is almost as hideous as redmond
2009-08-05T10:16:00.000Z	mezquitale	Shu	first go to "software sources" in "System-->Administration" and enable universe, restricted, and multiverse == READ the text and click on the squares
2009-08-05T10:17:00.000Z	mezquitale	Shu	click on "software sources", you can enable all of those in "software sources"
2009-08-05T10:17:00.000Z	Shu	mezquitale	They are all already checked, and so is main
2009-08-05T10:17:00.000Z	mezquitale	Shu	now click on "Add/remove" and install xchat
2009-08-05T10:19:00.000Z	Shu	mezquitale	I just go to download Xchat, save to my desktop,and then what?
2009-08-05T10:20:00.000Z	mezquitale	Shu	you have to be specific in what youre trying to accomplish.  Do you want to install software on a machine that is connected to the internet???
2009-08-05T10:23:00.000Z	mezquitale	Shu	how did you install xchat on your laptop?
2009-08-05T10:26:00.000Z	mezquitale	Shu	turn on your other machine with ubuntu and go over the things I just described.  With ubuntu you dont have to download anything and run an "exe" file.  All you have to do is go to "add/remove" search for xchat and install the software, it is really that easy
2009-08-05T10:27:00.000Z	Shu	mezquitale	if I go to, say, download Xchat from a link on the internet, I would click save to desktop, then after it finishes putting it onto my desktop, I go to add/remove, select XChat, and then....?
2009-08-05T10:29:00.000Z	mezquitale	Shu	no.  You are not listening.  In order to install software you can do it 2 ways.  One, connect your machine to the internet then go to "add/remove" and install whatever you want.  The other choice is to download the "exe" file for ubuntu, which is a ".deb" file.  If you want to download the ".deb" file go to google and download the ".deb" file for xchat.  Once you have the ".deb" file for xchat all you have to do is copy it to yo
2009-08-05T10:32:00.000Z	mezquitale	Shu	you are not listening.
2009-08-05T10:33:00.000Z	mezquitale	Shu	i know youre just as surprised as I am but it's actually quite possible, not matter how much bill told you that it's not
2009-08-05T10:34:00.000Z	mezquitale	Shu	connect your machine to the internet, go to "add/remove", search for the software that you want, and ubuntu will install it for you, no need to google for the file, download it, click on it, install it, nothing.  Just connect your machine to the internet, go to "add/remove", and install, that's it!! No gimmicks!!  No fraud!!!
2009-08-05T10:35:00.000Z	mezquitale	Shu	come back when you are on your ubuntu machine
