2007-04-02T05:24:00.000Z	madman91		How do I find out which program was written in which language?
2007-04-02T05:24:00.000Z	gnomefreak	madman91	look at the source code or look for docs on it
2007-04-02T05:25:00.000Z	madman91	gnomefreak	i tried.. there must be an easier way
2007-04-02T05:25:00.000Z	gnomefreak	madman91	what program?
2007-04-02T05:26:00.000Z	madman91	gnomefreak	well.. lets say.. xchat
2007-04-02T05:26:00.000Z	madman91	gnomefreak	or gaim
2007-04-02T05:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	madman91	pick an app but i believe both are C or C++
2007-04-02T05:27:00.000Z	madman91	gnomefreak	is there a definite way to know?
2007-04-02T05:27:00.000Z	madman91	gnomefreak	like a database?
2007-04-02T05:28:00.000Z	gnomefreak	madman91	look at the source code. alot of apps are not written in one lang.
2007-04-02T05:28:00.000Z	gnomefreak	madman91	no no database that im aware of
2007-04-02T05:28:00.000Z	madman91	gnomefreak	.. so one program can be made of many languages? ... twisted...
2007-04-02T05:28:00.000Z	gnomefreak	madman91	yes
2007-04-02T05:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	madman91	most likely its your Usplash configuration (i cant think of the usplash folder off hand)
2007-04-02T05:29:00.000Z	madman91	gnomefreak	? usplash ?
2007-04-02T05:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	madman91	yes usplash. madman91 please run sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-04-02T05:31:00.000Z	madman91	gnomefreak	but where did you get usplash from? ... i didnt ask anything about booting
2007-04-02T05:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	madman91	99% of time when you boot you get that because the usplash is at a higher rate than your monitor
2007-04-02T05:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	madman91	i told you what to do
2007-04-02T05:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	madman91	while booting == im betting you never see usplsh
2007-04-02T05:32:00.000Z	madman91	gnomefreak	NO.. it was madmax .. not madman91
2007-04-02T05:32:00.000Z	madman91	gnomefreak	:)
