2007-11-19T06:54:00.000Z	Lapinux		does ubuntu server install disk support raid or do i have to use the alternate text only install?
2007-11-19T06:54:00.000Z	Pelo	Lapinux	I beleive that server and alt cd both have the raid stuff on them
2007-11-19T06:55:00.000Z	Lapinux	Pelo	i think you helped me earlier with the grub problem?
2007-11-19T06:56:00.000Z	Pelo	Lapinux	I may have, what is your current issue ?
2007-11-19T06:57:00.000Z	Lapinux	Pelo	system wont boot :)
2007-11-19T06:57:00.000Z	Pelo	Lapinux	 with the super grub cd right ?
2007-11-19T06:57:00.000Z	Lapinux	Pelo	i tried it, i must be stupid cause it was confusing...
2007-11-19T06:59:00.000Z	Pelo	Lapinux	how old is this install of ubuntu on your comp ?
2007-11-19T06:59:00.000Z	Lapinux	Pelo	brand new on the one im having issues with
2007-11-19T06:59:00.000Z	Lapinux	Pelo	i have a ide drive as storage, it says its hdc, then i have 2 sata drives
2007-11-19T06:59:00.000Z	Pelo	Lapinux	 just clean install it , it will be easier,  the grub issue will take care of itself
2007-11-19T07:00:00.000Z	Lapinux	Pelo	i dont think it will, it was a fresh install, and it didnt work
2007-11-19T07:00:00.000Z	Pelo	Lapinux	 my recommendation is that you change the boot hdd in the bios to the hdd you will install ubuntu on before you install ubuntu
2007-11-19T07:01:00.000Z	Lapinux	Pelo	it was set to sata, which is where i installed ubuntu
2007-11-19T07:01:00.000Z	Pelo	Lapinux	unplug the storage hdd before proceeding you can add it to grub after ward
2007-11-19T07:01:00.000Z	Lapinux	Pelo	i was going to reinstall without the ide drive hooked up, then hook it up later, am stil afaid it will mess up when i do hook it up
2007-11-19T07:02:00.000Z	Pelo	Lapinux	it shouldn'T not as long as it is not set as the boot hdd
2007-11-19T07:02:00.000Z	Lapinux	Pelo	? if its a storage drive, i wouldnt add it to grub ?
2007-11-19T07:03:00.000Z	Lapinux	Pelo	well my thought was the bios treats the ide's as the first drives and the sata after that, even though i tell it to boot sata first
2007-11-19T07:03:00.000Z	Pelo	Lapinux	grub should only list  OS not drives
2007-11-19T07:04:00.000Z	Pelo	Lapinux	 leave the storage hdd in then, put it as boot hdd, in the bios and let phase one of grub install to it , that will solve the problem but you won't be able to boot fi you remove the storage hdd afterward
2007-11-19T07:05:00.000Z	Lapinux	Pelo	yeah, i understand that
