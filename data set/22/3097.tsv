2008-12-08T01:16:00.000Z	rafting		what type of person is ubuntu geared at? casual user, programmer, sys admin?
2008-12-08T01:17:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	if you're comparing between linux distros I'd say it's as casual as it gets.. user friendly.. works out of the box etc
2008-12-08T03:20:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	a quick format can be undone by simple downloadable tools anyone can use.. if you do it properly it gets harder.. but there are still ways.. but now they cost money.. a lot of money
2008-12-08T03:21:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	think of it as painting a house.. you can paint it again.. but there will still be ways of finding out the old color.. right?
2008-12-08T03:22:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	same thing with hard drives.. you can use wipe to write random stuff several times.. it takes a lot of time though
2008-12-08T03:27:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	it's not electronics.. it's magnetics =)
2008-12-08T03:28:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	you have a platter you can change some magnetic property on.. if it's magnetized in one way you call it 1, another way it's a 0.. but you can magnetize most of it.. but there will still be old traces left..
2008-12-08T03:29:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	but this doesn't make it recoverable by just using "Undelete 2000 turbo plus"... you have to send it to a lab.. and they will have to reconstruct the data.. bit by bit..
2008-12-08T03:29:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	so it's really really really expensive..
2008-12-08T03:30:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	if you just want to make sure your old files aren't recoverable you can use wipe.. it writes random stuff where the file were.. then you end up having to send the drive to that expensive lab if you want the files back.. and I doubt anything you can put on a hard drive is worth that kind of money
2008-12-11T03:15:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	do you have some kind of wireless router?
2008-12-11T03:15:00.000Z	rafting	Slart	yes
2008-12-11T03:15:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	can't you connect to it using the wired connection?
2008-12-11T03:16:00.000Z	rafting	Slart	the wired is setup differently it was a huge pain in the ass to get it working in the first place
2008-12-11T03:16:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	then you need to read the manual for the router.. or temporarily use some other computer that *can* connect to the wireless network
2008-12-11T03:17:00.000Z	rafting	Slart	ok im dumb im using vista now, so how can i change the authoirty? and to what?
2008-12-11T03:17:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	that would depend entirely on your router..
2008-12-11T03:17:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	usually is has some kind of web interface where you can change stuff
2008-12-11T03:20:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	sounds reasonable
2008-12-11T03:21:00.000Z	rafting	Slart	but what should I then set it to? because now i have wpa-personal and I give the correct key and cant log on.
2008-12-11T03:22:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	I'm horrible with wireless and all it's encryptions.. you'll be better off asking the channel for wireless advice
2008-12-12T01:04:00.000Z	Slart	rafting	you have to disable authentication on the wireless router.. usually via some kind of web-interface
