2009-05-05T12:12:00.000Z	KB1JWQ		What's the Ubuntu equivalent to chkconfig --list on redhat based stuff?
2009-05-05T12:12:00.000Z	aspidites	KB1JWQ	and what does chkconfig --list do?
2009-05-05T12:14:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	aspidites	So chkconfig postfix on sets postfix to start at boot, chkconfig postfix off disables it at boot, and --list shows what services start at particular runlevels.
2009-05-05T12:15:00.000Z	aspidites	KB1JWQ	aah. sorry, not sure of the equivalent
2009-05-05T12:15:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	aspidites	No worries.  Thanks anyway. :)
2009-05-05T12:16:00.000Z	aspidites	KB1JWQ	seems the package exists on debian though, so it should be the same in ubuntu
2009-05-05T12:16:00.000Z	aspidites	KB1JWQ	http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=chkconfig
2009-05-05T12:17:00.000Z	aspidites	KB1JWQ	it'd be your basic sudo apt-get install chkconfig
2009-05-05T12:19:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	aspidites	Was hoping not to install it; it feels like cheating to turn Ubuntu into RedHat. :-p
2009-05-05T12:20:00.000Z	aspidites	KB1JWQ	lol. fair enough
2009-05-06T11:11:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	aspidites	The /topic there gives great pointers.
2009-05-06T11:11:00.000Z	aspidites	KB1JWQ	i've been a few times, but i wouldn't say go to an irc chat to LEARN a langauge. maybe for getting help, sure. or if you already know a bit /topic is fine
2009-05-06T11:12:00.000Z	aspidites	KB1JWQ	of ourse, this is just MHO
2009-05-06T11:12:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	aspidites	Heh, the topic there includes a link to said tutorial. :)
2009-05-06T11:12:00.000Z	aspidites	KB1JWQ	touche. never bothered clicking on it, considering i just recently got hyperlinks working in terminals
2009-05-06T11:12:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	aspidites	Copy/paste works wonders though. :)
2009-05-06T11:13:00.000Z	aspidites	KB1JWQ	i also just recently learned how to copy/paste from a terminal ;-) (shift+insert)
2009-05-06T11:13:00.000Z	aspidites	KB1JWQ	using urxvt, so no gui right-clicking here
2009-05-06T11:15:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	aspidites	ITYM ctrl alt backspace?
2009-05-06T11:15:00.000Z	aspidites	KB1JWQ	youre right. duno why i forgot to add the alt
2009-05-06T11:15:00.000Z	aspidites	KB1JWQ	most of my bindings use alt, so i just forget it
2009-05-06T11:16:00.000Z	aspidites	KB1JWQ	heck, you're talking to a guy that swapped his caps lock and ctrl keys ;-)
