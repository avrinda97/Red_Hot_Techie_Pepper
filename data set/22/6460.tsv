2006-12-16T07:29:00.000Z	blanky		hey guys, I was downloading eclipse-sdk through sudo apt-get install, but it was a 100 something MB download, I stopped it with CTRL+C because I don't wnat to download it right now, is there a way to remove the stuff it downloaded?
2006-12-16T07:29:00.000Z	blanky		anyone
2006-12-16T07:29:00.000Z	blanky		okay just ignore me, guys :'(
2006-12-16T07:30:00.000Z	SilentDis	blanky	 it'll store the partial files in a partial area until you finish the install
2006-12-16T07:30:00.000Z	SilentDis	blanky	 they won't affect your machine at all.
2006-12-16T07:31:00.000Z	SilentDis	blanky	 yes, clean will kill the debs
2007-02-20T10:13:00.000Z	blanky	SilentDis	sorry dont know what you mean, but maybe /etc/apt/sources.list is what you want?
2007-02-20T10:14:00.000Z	SilentDis	blanky	just installed xubuntu on a laptop, it's gotta pull 127mb of updates.  not gonna happen.  was figuring since I'm running the same distro on this machine (ubuntu 6.10), I could use it's apt-cache as a repository of sorts for that machine.
2007-02-20T10:15:00.000Z	SilentDis	blanky	easy enough to nfs share out out my local /var/cache/apt/archives afterall :)
2007-02-20T10:16:00.000Z	blanky	SilentDis	there's an apt command I forgot what it was (try apt help or something) where it just downloads the deb's and doesn't install them, then I guess you can install them yourself with something like sudo dpkg -i *.deb
2007-02-20T10:16:00.000Z	blanky	SilentDis	and elyon225, though there's probably an easier way to do it, I think SilentDis knows more than me here
2007-02-20T10:17:00.000Z	SilentDis	blanky	sort of.  this machine is fully updated.  it's cache has a good amount of the .debs I'd need.  I can easily share out the /var/cache/apt/archives on this machine.
2007-02-20T10:17:00.000Z	blanky	SilentDis	ohhh I see what you mean, you already have them
2007-02-20T10:18:00.000Z	blanky	SilentDis	sorry man I don't know, I think you know more than me, but couldn't you set the path in /etc/apt/sources.list?
2007-02-20T10:18:00.000Z	SilentDis	blanky	yep
2007-02-20T10:19:00.000Z	SilentDis	blanky	checking the list now... I am not sure how to specify it though.  that's a collection of repos in there, is it possible to specify a directory as a repo?
2007-02-20T10:20:00.000Z	blanky	SilentDis	I'm sorry, I don't know, though I'm pretty sure. I suggest going into #debian and asking, pretending you use debian
2007-02-20T10:21:00.000Z	SilentDis	blanky	no need to pretend.  I'm pretty proficient in a linux environment, just don't know the ins and outs of the apt package system yet is all :)
2007-02-20T10:21:00.000Z	blanky	SilentDis	yeah it looks like you know lots :D still, the debianers can be pretty mean :(
2007-02-20T10:21:00.000Z	blanky	SilentDis	even IF you use debian hehe
2007-02-20T10:22:00.000Z	SilentDis	blanky	*shrug* every group has it's... interesting... members.  there's always people willing to help too.  just gotta look around a bit is all.  :)
