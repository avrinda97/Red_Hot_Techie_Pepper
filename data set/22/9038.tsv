2005-12-08T17:51:00.000Z	Orporg		Ok.  I put in the following:  IP Address: 192.168.0.104, Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0.  Gateway address: 192.168.2.1.  Do I just hit OK now?
2005-12-08T17:52:00.000Z	Orporg		Should I activate and deactivate the wlan0?
2005-12-08T17:53:00.000Z	Orporg		Still nothing
2005-12-08T17:54:00.000Z	Orporg		The Ubuntu machine is a desktop.  The Mac machine is a laptop.  The Windows is a desktop.
2005-12-08T17:54:00.000Z	Orporg		No
2005-12-08T17:54:00.000Z	Orporg		It's just good ol' PCI
2005-12-08T17:56:00.000Z	Orporg		I can't, sorry.  If it helps, the access point is about 3 feet from the computer so signal strength isn't a problem
2005-12-08T17:58:00.000Z	Orporg		It says:  No scan results when I put in: "iwlist wlan0 scan"
2005-12-08T17:59:00.000Z	Orporg		I have no signal strength meter in Linux.  I'm going off the other machine's signal
2005-12-08T17:59:00.000Z	Orporg		I wish I had another one of these damn cards
2005-12-08T06:00:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	Orporg	try 'ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 up && iwlist eth0 scan'
2005-12-08T06:00:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	Orporg	yeah.
2005-12-08T06:02:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	Orporg	did you try 'ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 up && iwlist eth0 scan' yet?
2005-12-08T06:03:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	Orporg	some cards won't scan unless they are "up", and sometimes you have to try multiple times. Is this something you done with ndiswcrapper
2005-12-08T06:05:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	Orporg	yeah, it's for getting windows drivers installed for wireless.
2005-12-08T06:06:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	Orporg	you said it said Mode: Auto? in iwconfig?
2005-12-08T06:06:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	Orporg	try 'sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode managed'
2005-12-08T06:07:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	Orporg	then run iwconfig again and see if it's connected.
2005-12-08T06:07:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	Orporg	also - are you using WEP?
2005-12-08T06:11:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	Orporg	you shouldn't have to use ndiswrapper if it's showing wlan0.
2005-12-08T06:11:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	Orporg	does your laptop have a hotkey type thing like Fn F11 to turn the wirelss on/off?
2005-12-08T06:12:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	Orporg	hehe, if it's even a laptop.
