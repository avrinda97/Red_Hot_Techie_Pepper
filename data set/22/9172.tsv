2005-02-13T13:53:00.000Z	Martok		We're all Linux users here... we're all ok.
2005-02-13T13:54:00.000Z	Martok		We're all using the same kernel, damn!
2005-02-13T13:56:00.000Z	Martok		And who here seriously uses the HURD?
2005-02-13T13:58:00.000Z	Martok		Ubuntu is friendly, thank god for that.
2005-02-13T13:59:00.000Z	Martok		Gnome is way better.
2005-02-13T14:00:00.000Z	Martok		I couldn't even get the Live CD to boot on my HP notebook.
2005-02-13T14:00:00.000Z	Martok		Give me Gnome or give me the console!
2005-02-13T14:02:00.000Z	Martok		I'm still waiting for an LCARS based window manager, heh heh heh.
2005-02-13T14:02:00.000Z	Martok		Indigo magic? I don't know what that is.
2005-02-13T14:02:00.000Z	nanophase	Martok	 well I thing that would be cool once we drop this whole PC architecture we have today :)
2005-02-13T14:03:00.000Z	Martok	nanophase	Do you know of any cool novel window managers?
2005-02-13T14:04:00.000Z	nanophase	Martok	 nope, I made a skin for Evidence  (lcars) tho
2005-02-13T14:04:00.000Z	nanophase	Martok	 they just don't make sense
2005-02-13T14:06:00.000Z	nanophase	Martok	 haha, you may understand what I mean after a bit of usage
2005-02-13T14:06:00.000Z	nanophase	Martok	  Do you have a 3D mouse?
2005-02-13T14:06:00.000Z	Martok	nanophase	I think you're just mad that I'm going into the future while you stay in the past.
2005-02-13T14:06:00.000Z	nanophase	Martok	 no commend on that one, good luck with 3ddesktop!
2005-02-13T14:06:00.000Z	Martok	nanophase	I'm moving forward while you're staying in the same place.
2005-02-13T14:08:00.000Z	nanophase	Martok	 I tried 3ddesktop way before you knew it exists so that's all about future :>
2005-02-13T14:09:00.000Z	Martok	nanophase	When I get back I'll be all 3Dized, while you'll still be all 2Dized and low tech.
2005-02-13T14:13:00.000Z	nanophase	Martok	 well either that or you don't have any idea about what you are saying, you decide :)
