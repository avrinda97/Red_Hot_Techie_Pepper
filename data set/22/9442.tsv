2005-03-18T17:30:00.000Z	theine		hi, do ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile get sourced when gnome starts up?
2005-03-18T17:30:00.000Z	theine		they don't, do they?
2005-03-18T17:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	theine	/etc/bash.bashrc  I think
2005-03-18T17:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	theine	system wide
2005-03-18T17:33:00.000Z	theine	thoreauputic	ok, but i would really need to set user specific environment variables
2005-03-18T17:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	theine	.bashrc is for non-login shells, IIRC
2005-03-18T17:36:00.000Z	theine	thoreauputic	yes, but if i set an environment variable in ~/.bashrc, for example firefox doesn't know of it when launched from the gnome menu, does it?
2005-03-18T17:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	theine	I guess not
2005-04-14T13:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	theine	in gnome? You usually set $PATH on the commandline or editing .bashrc or similar
2005-04-14T13:29:00.000Z	theine	thoreauputic	apokryphos: guys, i know, but it only sets the path in the shell
2005-04-14T13:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	theine	/etc/bash.bashrc if I remember correctly
2005-04-14T13:32:00.000Z	theine	thoreauputic	Apparently one can set the path in ~/.gnomerc
2005-04-14T13:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	theine	ah, useful :)
2005-08-02T05:33:00.000Z	theine	thoreauputic	but ubuntu freezes sid, not sarge, doesn't it?
2005-08-02T05:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	theine	yes, but they are still out of synch
2005-08-02T05:34:00.000Z	theine	thoreauputic	fair enough
2006-01-15T06:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	theine	the lines are there in ,bashrc - just a question of removing the #
2006-01-15T06:48:00.000Z	theine	thoreauputic	I know
2006-01-15T06:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	theine	OK :)
2006-01-15T06:48:00.000Z	theine	thoreauputic	that's why I said `uncomment that line' :)
2006-01-15T06:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	theine	actually it is an if statement ( 3 lines ) to be pedantic :)
2006-01-15T06:49:00.000Z	theine	thoreauputic	you're right
