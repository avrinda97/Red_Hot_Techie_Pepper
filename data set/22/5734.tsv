2008-01-02T01:27:00.000Z	killux		Hey, I just tried to install Xubuntu 7.10 on my PS3 which has 2.10 firmware but I am getting some errors. Everything goes fine until when its installing the kernel. The kernel it's trying to install is called "linux-cell". The error message is this: "An error was returned while trying to install the kernel into the target system." Does anyone know why this happens and how I can fix this?
2008-01-02T01:28:00.000Z	tbuss	killux	choose reinstall base system, then it will give three options when installing the kernel, choose the last option
2008-01-02T01:28:00.000Z	killux	tbuss	thanks
2008-01-02T01:29:00.000Z	killux	tbuss	will that kernel work with 2.10 firmware?
2008-01-02T01:30:00.000Z	tbuss	killux	it should, I updated to latest firmware before install, check the forums a psubuntu.com
2008-01-02T01:30:00.000Z	killux	tbuss	not really of any help those forums
2008-01-02T01:31:00.000Z	tbuss	killux	the problem you are having is addressed there, it is were I found a resolution
2008-01-02T01:32:00.000Z	killux	tbuss	when you were installing, did you use a wired connection?
2008-01-02T01:32:00.000Z	tbuss	killux	not at first ;)
2008-01-02T01:33:00.000Z	tbuss	killux	wireless is tricky, if you can install initially with wired I would recommend it
2008-01-02T01:33:00.000Z	killux	tbuss	OK
2008-01-02T01:42:00.000Z	killux	tbuss	im on the part of selectng and installing software and its hanging at like 6%
2008-01-02T01:42:00.000Z	tbuss	killux	give it some time, it hung for a while with me also
2008-01-02T01:43:00.000Z	killux	tbuss	ok
2008-01-02T01:43:00.000Z	tbuss	killux	did you choose to overwrite current files or keep existing
2008-01-02T01:43:00.000Z	killux	tbuss	^
2008-01-02T01:44:00.000Z	tbuss	killux	when reinstalling the base system it should have prompted you about files already installed, did you choose to keep or reinstall completely
2008-01-02T01:44:00.000Z	killux	tbuss	was that the wrong move?
2008-01-02T01:45:00.000Z	tbuss	killux	did you choose to keep?
2008-01-02T01:45:00.000Z	killux	tbuss	yes
2008-01-02T01:46:00.000Z	tbuss	killux	okay, when it gets to the part with the kernel you should be prompted with three choices, remember to choose the last option
2008-01-02T01:47:00.000Z	tbuss	killux	okay, give it some time, my install hung on 6% also.
