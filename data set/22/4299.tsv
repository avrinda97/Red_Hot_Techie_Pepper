2008-12-15T14:05:00.000Z	Bryan	rww	well I installed icedtea6-plugin and it's not working in my browser ;/
2008-12-15T14:05:00.000Z	rww	Bryan	which browser are you using?
2008-12-15T14:05:00.000Z	rww		!hostname | ja660k
2008-12-15T14:05:00.000Z	Bryan	rww	firefox
2008-12-15T14:05:00.000Z	Bryan		firefox3 to be more specific
2008-12-15T14:06:00.000Z	rww	Bryan	navigate to "about:plugins" in firefox and see if there's an entry in there for "IcedTea Web Browser Plugin"
2008-12-15T14:07:00.000Z	Bryan	rww	:s nothing.
2008-12-15T14:09:00.000Z	rww	Bryan	so there are other plugins in there, but the IcedTea one is missing?
2008-12-15T14:10:00.000Z	Bryan	rww	no there is no entry for java at all.
2008-12-15T14:10:00.000Z	Bryan		-_-;
2008-12-15T14:11:00.000Z	Bryan	rww	My name is bryan and I am a noob. I had disabled java in the FF preferences.
2008-12-15T14:11:00.000Z	rww	Bryan	if you don't have an aversion to non-free software, you could try installing Sun's Java plugin instead and see if that works better...
2008-12-15T14:11:00.000Z	rww	Bryan	hehe, it works now?
2008-12-15T14:11:00.000Z	Bryan	rww	actually, I had wanted that.
2008-12-15T14:11:00.000Z	Bryan		Because I'm trying to play a game, and the icedtea plugin kinda...well..It does preform as well as I would like :c
2008-12-15T14:12:00.000Z	rww	Bryan	hehe. So IcedTea appears when you enable Java again?
2008-12-15T14:12:00.000Z	Bryan		yes it does indeed
2008-12-15T14:13:00.000Z	Bryan	rww	But I would rather use Sun's java plugin; because it preforms a bit better for what I want to do with the java plugin.
2008-12-15T14:13:00.000Z	rww	Bryan	okay. I think the Sun Java plugin is sun-java6-jre? I'm not sure. If you want other similar stuff, you could install ubuntu-restricted-extras, which definitely has it.
2008-12-15T14:13:00.000Z	Bryan		ah mmk
2008-12-15T14:14:00.000Z	rww	Bryan	ubuntu-restricted-extras also includes non-free flash and various other stuff like that. But yeah, I know for sure that after installing that you'll have Sun's java plugin.
