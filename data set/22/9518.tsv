2004-10-13T09:54:00.000Z	DimSum		I'm a Windows user anyway, I'm just hanging out here because I love the Ubuntu look and feel
2004-10-13T09:54:00.000Z	DimSum		I ported their theme, Human, to XP ;P
2004-10-13T09:54:00.000Z	DimSum		Yeah
2004-10-13T09:54:00.000Z	DimSum		Linux is unusable as a main OS, though... just something to play with, really
2004-10-13T09:55:00.000Z	DimSum		Hmmm, only if they didn't encounter any problems with it in the course of their work
2004-10-13T09:56:00.000Z	DimSum		Windows and OS X has Linux beat hands-down in that respect
2004-10-13T09:56:00.000Z	DimSum		Windows more than OS X, as well.
2004-10-13T09:57:00.000Z	DimSum		Obviously you've never used Windows properly, then.
2004-10-13T09:57:00.000Z	DimSum		I use all five major platforms on a daily basis, and I have never had a single issue with Windows since Windows ME, oooh... 4 years ago now.
2004-10-13T09:58:00.000Z	jkg	DimSum	have you had problems with your networking randomly stopping working under Ubuntu?
2004-10-13T09:58:00.000Z	DimSum	jkg	Yes
2004-10-13T09:59:00.000Z	DimSum	jkg	Had to edit the network conf files to get it to work again, since the Network Settings applet didn't actually work.
2004-10-13T10:00:00.000Z	DimSum	jkg	Fedora isn't bad, either, but it's still LINUX
2004-10-13T10:00:00.000Z	DimSum	jkg	Then you might want to consider that you're having hardware issues
2004-10-13T10:02:00.000Z	DimSum	jkg	Keep up to date with patches and you won't have any issues.
2004-10-13T10:02:00.000Z	jkg	DimSum	what because the patches fix issues that don't exist until the patch is released, or something/
2004-10-13T10:03:00.000Z	DimSum	jkg	No, it's that nobody KNOWS about them until the patch is released
2004-10-13T10:06:00.000Z	jkg	DimSum	I'm really not sure why you're here. if Windows is perfection personified, and nothing else is worth considering...
2004-10-13T10:07:00.000Z	DimSum	jkg	As I've said earlier, I'm here because I happen to think that Ubuntu is the best distro of a barely tolerable bunch, and I like the UI
2004-10-13T10:07:00.000Z	DimSum	jkg	just out of interest, what version of Windows do you run at the moment?
2004-10-13T10:07:00.000Z	DimSum	jkg	Specifics...
