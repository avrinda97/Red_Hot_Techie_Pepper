2011-07-11T02:26:00.000Z	Phr3d-13		well, for anyone interested...
2011-07-11T02:26:00.000Z	Phr3d-13		i found a patch guide to hopefully get my vt6410 (pci ide card) working
2011-07-11T02:27:00.000Z	pfifo	Phr3d-13	have fun with that
2011-07-11T05:10:00.000Z	Phr3d-13	pfifo	i re-compiled from this guide http://it-kediri.com/?p=80
2011-07-11T05:05:00.000Z	pfifo	Phr3d-13	sources are about 200MB or so
2011-07-11T05:05:00.000Z	pfifo	Phr3d-13	erm source + archive is about 100 mb or so, double that to 200mb to be safe
2011-07-11T05:06:00.000Z	pfifo	Phr3d-13	are you building lots of modules?
2011-07-11T05:08:00.000Z	pfifo	Phr3d-13	maybe gcc isnt using the -pipe option, hence dumping everything into /tmp
2011-07-11T05:08:00.000Z	pfifo	Phr3d-13	you should know exactly what your building, thats the whole point of compiling your own kernel :)
2011-07-11T05:10:00.000Z	Phr3d-13	pfifo	i believe all i turned on was something to support my pci ide card
2011-07-11T05:11:00.000Z	pfifo	Phr3d-13	all that did was take me to some youtube clone site
2011-07-11T05:11:00.000Z	Phr3d-13	pfifo	hmmmmm
2011-07-11T05:13:00.000Z	pfifo	Phr3d-13	well I doubt there much there to explain disk usage. Is there anyreason why you need to limit disk usage during compile?
2011-07-11T05:14:00.000Z	Phr3d-13	pfifo	almost ran out of space compiling the kernel, but now its done, and i can't figure out which one it is
2011-07-11T05:15:00.000Z	pfifo	Phr3d-13	should be in arch/i386/ (or x86)
2011-07-11T05:17:00.000Z	Phr3d-13	pfifo	no arch folder
2011-07-11T05:18:00.000Z	pfifo	Phr3d-13	well if your guide omits that part then it might as well be a youtube clone
2011-07-11T05:22:00.000Z	Phr3d-13	pfifo	http://pastebin.com/ktxLarJT   pasted guide i followed and the one diff i did
2011-07-11T05:23:00.000Z	pfifo	Phr3d-13	12. Once the kernel is built it will be one directory up in the ~/source file we were originally working in.
2011-07-11T05:24:00.000Z	pfifo	Phr3d-13	not sure, i build kernel with `make -j3`
2011-07-11T05:25:00.000Z	pfifo	Phr3d-13	something like arch/i386/vmlinuz
2011-07-11T05:26:00.000Z	pfifo	Phr3d-13	might be kernel/arch/i386/vmlinuz
