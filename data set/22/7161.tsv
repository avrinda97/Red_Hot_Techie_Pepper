2006-07-04T16:44:00.000Z	Schalken		is there anything that can be used to increase system performance?
2006-07-04T16:45:00.000Z	cwillu	Schalken	is there anything that can make me run faster?
2006-07-04T16:46:00.000Z	Schalken	cwillu	see above
2006-07-04T16:46:00.000Z	cwillu	Schalken	again, doesn't tell me much, but I'll take a guess that you might be swapping a bit aggressively
2006-07-04T16:46:00.000Z	cwillu	Schalken	try sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=0
2006-07-04T16:47:00.000Z	cwillu	Schalken	see why I asked?  :)
2006-07-04T16:48:00.000Z	Schalken	cwillu	uhm, i just did 'sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=0', what did i just do?
2006-07-04T16:49:00.000Z	cwillu	Schalken	it tells the kernel to not swap out processes until absolutely neccessary;  if apps are hanging for a few seconds at a time, it's generally a good approach
2006-07-04T16:49:00.000Z	cwillu	Schalken	but i still don't know if that's your problem :)
2006-07-04T16:49:00.000Z	Schalken	cwillu	hmm
2006-07-04T16:50:00.000Z	cwillu	Schalken	open a terminal window
2006-07-04T16:51:00.000Z	Schalken	cwillu	flying by
2006-07-04T16:51:00.000Z	Schalken	cwillu	zoom
2006-07-04T16:51:00.000Z	cwillu	Schalken	okay, doesn't sound like the vid card
2006-07-04T16:52:00.000Z	cwillu	Schalken	can you describe what you mean by slow?
2006-07-04T16:54:00.000Z	Schalken	cwillu	well its kinda the drawing. as i drag a window around the screen, it lags behind. and you can kinda see the window being drawn from top to bottom with each refresh of movement. (about 3 times a second)
2006-07-04T16:54:00.000Z	Schalken	cwillu	do you know what i mean? its like its struggling to draw the window on the screen.
2006-07-04T16:55:00.000Z	cwillu	Schalken	how do the screensaver's look?  (esp the 3d ones)
2006-07-04T16:55:00.000Z	Schalken	cwillu	like hell. as i said everything opengl runs at a frame every couple of seconds.
2006-07-04T16:57:00.000Z	Schalken	cwillu	hmmm. maybe it better run like anything when i get my geforce 6200. but right now im trying to do some word processing and scrolling the page goes really badly. :(
2006-07-04T16:59:00.000Z	cwillu	Schalken	what type of mb?
2006-07-04T05:00:00.000Z	Schalken	cwillu	gigabyte sis 661fx chipset with DDR400
