2012-11-22T00:18:00.000Z	GandalfB		Bobweaver, ok do you want me to pastebin the output from that grep?
2012-11-22T00:20:00.000Z	GandalfB		Bobweaver, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1375508/
2012-11-22T00:20:00.000Z	trism	GandalfB	dkms status; is also interesting if you haven't already pasted that
2012-11-22T00:24:00.000Z	trism	GandalfB	yeah added means it hasn't built yet, are we sure the headers are installed? dpkg -l 'linux-headers*'
2012-11-22T00:26:00.000Z	GandalfB	trism	I've run that, but the output is not meaninful to me, want me to pastebin it
2012-11-22T00:28:00.000Z	trism	GandalfB	ah yeah, sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r);
2012-11-22T00:29:00.000Z	trism	GandalfB	you have one of the packages but you need the arch specific version too
2012-11-22T00:29:00.000Z	trism	GandalfB	you may want linux-headers-generic too so future kernel upgrades will rebuild the nvidia module
2012-11-22T00:30:00.000Z	trism	GandalfB	make sure you type that command exactly, I see bobweaver posted it earlier
2012-11-22T00:30:00.000Z	GandalfB	trism	do I get that with apt-get install linux-headers-generic ?
2012-11-22T00:31:00.000Z	trism	GandalfB	yes
2012-11-22T00:33:00.000Z	trism	GandalfB	after that, check: dkms status; to see if the module built
2012-11-22T00:34:00.000Z	trism	GandalfB	it should say: nvidia-current, 304.64: installed
2012-11-22T00:34:00.000Z	GandalfB	trism	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1375547/
2012-11-22T00:35:00.000Z	GandalfB	trism	looks like it has to me
2012-11-22T00:35:00.000Z	trism	GandalfB	yep looks good to me too
2012-11-22T00:36:00.000Z	trism	GandalfB	definitely a good idea to reboot after rebuilding the nvidia module
2012-11-22T00:39:00.000Z	GandalfB	trism	yay freak yes fixed
2012-11-22T00:41:00.000Z	trism	GandalfB	excellent, glad to hear it
2012-11-22T00:44:00.000Z	trism	GandalfB	nvidia-settings?
2012-11-22T00:49:00.000Z	trism	GandalfB	it is okay, it is bug 1068341
2012-11-22T00:57:00.000Z	trism	GandalfB	yeah it is unfortunately a bit buggy, but as long as you have linux-headers-generic install you should be good from now on
