2008-08-12T22:19:00.000Z	Paavi2_0		i tried to resize the 1st partition on my usb-flash/stick/memory (/dev/sdb) and would've liked to create a second one, but gparted complains: http://paveaani.dyndns.org/gparted_details.htm i've got billix on this stick and have done: 'install-mbr -p1 /dev/sdb' and 'syslinux -s /dev/sdb1' ...any other ways to create a second partition on usb-memorystick?
2008-08-12T22:20:00.000Z	wols	Paavi2_0	pastebin english please. we can#t read that
2008-08-12T22:22:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	wols	yes you can, the lines in finnish aren't relevant...that's the standard output from my gparted. i'm sorry that part of it is in deed in finnish
2008-08-12T22:22:00.000Z	wols	Paavi2_0	then make it english
2008-08-12T22:38:00.000Z	wols	Paavi2_0	we don't support DSL or anything else but ubuntu
2008-08-12T22:38:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	wols	well my problem is on gparted _in_ ubuntu
2008-08-12T22:49:00.000Z	wols	Paavi2_0	your mkfs was wrong and made a booboo
2008-08-12T22:49:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	wols	any idea how to solve that?
2008-08-12T22:50:00.000Z	wols	Paavi2_0	redo the filesystem. is the fs really fat?
2008-08-12T22:52:00.000Z	wols	Paavi2_0	please answer me
2008-08-12T22:53:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	wols	fat16 it claims to be
2008-08-12T22:53:00.000Z	wols	Paavi2_0	I don't ask you what it claims to be but what is IS
2008-08-12T22:53:00.000Z	wols	Paavi2_0	linux partitions where linux itself is installed as fat is very very rare
2008-08-12T22:53:00.000Z	wols	Paavi2_0	file -s <dev file of usb partition>
2008-08-12T22:54:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	wols	mount says vfat, gparted says fat16
2008-08-12T22:54:00.000Z	wols	Paavi2_0	don't mount it when you use gparted. delete the partition again. make the filesystem under windows that should fix it.
2008-08-12T22:56:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	wols	it's fat (16bit), haven't got any windows (argh!) :(
2008-08-12T22:56:00.000Z	wols	Paavi2_0	use freedos maybe? if you can
2008-08-12T22:56:00.000Z	wols	Paavi2_0	or make the partition in gparted?
2008-08-12T22:58:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	wols	delete sdb1 and make a new one? i hope it doesn't turn this thing into waste.
2008-08-12T22:58:00.000Z	wols	Paavi2_0	the mkfs command you used before made a fat that windosw won't like according to gparted
2008-08-12T23:00:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	wols	that's the partition that came on this stick i just bought today :) just added mbr to it...
