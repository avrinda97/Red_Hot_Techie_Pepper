2012-03-01T11:20:00.000Z	Guest40224		Spotify used to open fine using wine, now it doesn't
2012-03-01T11:20:00.000Z	Guest40224		Have they changed it recently?
2012-03-01T11:21:00.000Z	crizzy	Guest40224	i use native linux client, works fine
2012-03-01T11:21:00.000Z	Guest40224	crizzy	Don't you need premium for the native client?
2012-03-01T11:21:00.000Z	crizzy	Guest40224	yes, you do. but i need it for android/3g streaming anyway
2012-03-01T11:22:00.000Z	Guest40224	crizzy	Well, yeah, I can't afford that haha. I use google music for my android streaming.
2012-03-01T11:23:00.000Z	crizzy	Guest40224	it's only like 9,90eur/month :)
2012-03-01T11:23:00.000Z	crizzy	Guest40224	price of a burger meal here :P
2012-03-01T11:24:00.000Z	crizzy	Guest40224	isn't google music us-only anyway? :/
2012-03-01T11:25:00.000Z	Guest40224	crizzy	I'm not sure about google music's global availability
2012-03-01T11:25:00.000Z	Guest40224	crizzy	Although from what I've used it seems really well done.  The beta phase was shaky, but now it really seems to have come together.
2012-03-01T11:26:00.000Z	crizzy	Guest40224	take a look here: http://gnome-shell.deviantart.com/gallery/29380653
2012-03-01T11:27:00.000Z	crizzy	Guest40224	also here http://abhizweblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/some-gtk-3-themes-ubuntu-n-fedora.html
2012-03-01T11:28:00.000Z	Guest40224	crizzy	I think someone else was looking for the themes
2012-03-01T11:31:00.000Z	Guest40224	crizzy	I change my wallpaper like every day.  I'm a fan of reddit.com/r/earthporn  NOTE: That is not actually porn, it is entirely SFW.
2012-03-01T11:42:00.000Z	crizzy	Guest40224	i think you should add the spotify repository key to get them verified
2012-03-01T11:42:00.000Z	Guest40224	crizzy	Why does it stop all my like 300+ updates though, why can't I just skip the spotify one?
2012-03-01T11:42:00.000Z	crizzy	Guest40224	http://www.spotify.com/fi/download/previews/ see here anyway
2012-03-01T11:43:00.000Z	crizzy	Guest40224	make all those steps, then spotify updates should have no problem
