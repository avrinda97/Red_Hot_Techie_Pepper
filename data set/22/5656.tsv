2007-04-02T16:57:00.000Z	nickk		does anyone know how to load a script (self written) on startup?
2007-04-02T16:57:00.000Z	crimsun	nickk	see /etc/rc.local
2007-04-02T16:58:00.000Z	nickk	crimsun	i'm looking at it right now... should I just add my code at the end of whatever is already there?
2007-04-02T16:59:00.000Z	crimsun	nickk	before the `exit 0'
2007-04-02T16:59:00.000Z	nickk	crimsun	there is no `exit 0` in the file
2007-04-02T05:00:00.000Z	crimsun	nickk	...there should be at the end
2007-04-02T05:00:00.000Z	nickk	crimsun	it ends with `esac`
2007-04-02T05:00:00.000Z	crimsun	nickk	dapper? edgy? feisty?
2007-04-02T05:00:00.000Z	nickk	crimsun	edgy
2007-04-02T05:01:00.000Z	nickk	crimsun	any ideas?
2007-04-02T05:01:00.000Z	crimsun	nickk	can you pastebin your /etc/rc.local, please?
2007-04-02T05:02:00.000Z	nickk	crimsun	how do i pastebin... what is that? (sorry i'm pretty new)
2007-04-02T05:03:00.000Z	nickk	crimsun	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13448/
2007-04-02T05:04:00.000Z	crimsun	nickk	err, you can't be looking at /etc/rc.local
2007-04-02T05:04:00.000Z	nickk	crimsun	not so sure what you mean
2007-04-02T05:04:00.000Z	crimsun	nickk	that file that you pastebinned references /etc/rc.local in a shell command, so checking for the existence of itself is meaningless...
2007-04-02T05:05:00.000Z	crimsun	nickk	you need to look at /etc/rc.local  (the file)
2007-04-02T05:05:00.000Z	nickk	crimsun	i'm in /etc/init.d/ right now
2007-04-02T05:05:00.000Z	crimsun	nickk	cat /etc/rc.local
2007-04-02T05:06:00.000Z	nickk	crimsun	i see... how do I edit that? when i open it with gedit thats not the code i see
2007-04-02T05:07:00.000Z	crimsun	nickk	gksu 'gedit /etc/rc.local'
2007-04-02T05:07:00.000Z	nickk	crimsun	thank you so much :)
