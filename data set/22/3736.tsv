2008-07-22T11:53:00.000Z	error404notfound		how to use a network printer on command line?
2008-07-22T11:55:00.000Z	fde	error404notfound	links ipaddress:631 ?
2008-07-22T11:55:00.000Z	fde	error404notfound	of your machine.
2008-07-22T11:55:00.000Z	error404notfound	fde	it's a network printer, I know ts ip...
2008-07-22T11:55:00.000Z	fde	error404notfound	yes... but you want to configure it on the local machine...
2008-07-22T11:56:00.000Z	fde	error404notfound	that will present you with a web interface to configure cups
2008-07-22T11:57:00.000Z	error404notfound	fde	yup, I am on a terminal, I want to add it from terminal such that it appears in Gnome's system > administration > printing or KMenu > System Settings > Printers
2008-07-22T11:58:00.000Z	fde	error404notfound	Umm, you probably already have the driver... look through http://www.openprinting.org/printer_list.cgi
2008-07-22T12:00:00.000Z	error404notfound	fde	driver is not the issue, I just wanna add it from the cmmandline such that it also appears in GUI, its useful for my script
2008-07-22T12:01:00.000Z	fde	error404notfound	Configure it in the GUI, it'll work everywhere... make sure you have cups-bsd installed, then pipe docs through lpr
2008-07-22T12:02:00.000Z	error404notfound	fde	naaaahhhh, I want to add and configure it using shell, so that I create a script and give it to my users so they won't call me every now and then when they need to add the printer
2008-07-22T12:03:00.000Z	fde	error404notfound	distribute your cups.conf  ?
2008-07-22T12:04:00.000Z	fde	error404notfound	uhh... cupsd.conf ... sorry
2008-07-22T12:05:00.000Z	error404notfound	fde	distributing that will do the job?
2008-07-22T12:05:00.000Z	fde	error404notfound	sure
2008-07-22T12:08:00.000Z	error404notfound	fde	but cupsd.conf doensn't contain anything about that printer, neither its uri, nor anything else
2008-07-22T12:09:00.000Z	fde	error404notfound	Have you configured it via system-config-printer yet? look around in /etc/cups/ for other files you might want.
2008-07-22T12:10:00.000Z	error404notfound	fde	I am on ubuntu, and I using System > Admin > Printing
2008-07-22T12:10:00.000Z	fde	error404notfound	Umm, that is system-config-printer
2008-07-22T12:11:00.000Z	fde	error404notfound	look in /etc/cups/ for the files you need... everything you want is in there. there is no cli utility to configure cups
2008-07-22T12:11:00.000Z	error404notfound	fde	there is this printer.conf
2008-07-22T12:12:00.000Z	fde	error404notfound	Fresh install today, so I can't really reference specific files right now... sounds about right though.
