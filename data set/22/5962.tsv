2007-02-23T07:21:00.000Z	unop	IndyGunFreak	 in which context?
2007-02-23T07:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	unop	just saying the numbers not being sequential, doesn't seem like it should be that big of a deal.. its not to me anyways
2007-02-23T07:22:00.000Z	unop	IndyGunFreak	 ohh i see, no, it doesnt make any difference really (only that some people might suffer sever agitation and heat-strokes as a result) :)

2007-02-24T09:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	unop	you disagree?
2007-02-24T09:56:00.000Z	unop	IndyGunFreak	 yes, because if you dont protect your computer with one, you have no control over what originates from your computer itself
2007-02-24T09:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	unop	let me clarify that, i use a hardware firewall/router i've tweaked pretty well.
2007-02-24T09:57:00.000Z	unop	IndyGunFreak	 can that firewall (tweaked so well) control what originates on your computer that's destined for hosts on your LAN ?
