2007-09-07T14:28:00.000Z	betatest20		Q: how do I disable the zoom effect (this black frame) for resizing windows?
2007-09-07T14:29:00.000Z	Jowi	betatest20	we can not actually see what you see. which window manager are you using?
2007-09-07T14:30:00.000Z	betatest20	Jowi	I use ordenary ubuntu I guess, how do I find out more data that might help you?
2007-09-07T14:31:00.000Z	Jowi	betatest20	i don't know of a zoom in standard ubuntu. beryl has got a zoom. have you installed beryl or compiz?
2007-09-07T14:31:00.000Z	betatest20	Jowi	it's doinf it when I minimize a window to the taskbar, e.g
2007-09-07T14:32:00.000Z	Jowi	betatest20	ahhh. you mean it is a minimize animation?
2007-09-07T14:32:00.000Z	betatest20	Jowi	that must be it
2007-09-07T14:32:00.000Z	betatest20	Jowi	just an empty  wireframe
2007-09-07T14:33:00.000Z	Jowi	betatest20	I found an option in gconf-editor in /desktop/gnome/interface/enable_animations
2007-09-07T14:34:00.000Z	betatest20	Jowi	found that. do you think I have to restart x to apply the change?
2007-09-07T14:35:00.000Z	Jowi	betatest20	no, the changes should be seen immediately i think. maybe you need to log out.
2007-09-07T14:35:00.000Z	betatest20	Jowi	I will do that and report back, t.y. so far
2007-09-07T14:37:00.000Z	betatest20	Jowi	that didn't do the trick
2007-09-07T14:38:00.000Z	Jowi	betatest20	how about /apps/panel/global/enable_animations? (sorry i can not be more precise, i don't use gnome myself)
2007-09-07T14:38:00.000Z	betatest20	Jowi	need to relog, brb
2007-09-07T14:42:00.000Z	betatest20	Jowi	nope, still no luck, and I disabled all the occurances of "animation" in gconf
2007-09-07T14:44:00.000Z	Jowi	betatest20	then i have no idea...
2007-09-07T14:45:00.000Z	betatest20	Jowi	no biggie, thanks for your suggestions!
2007-09-07T14:51:00.000Z	betatest20	Jowi	I found a semi solution: /apps/metacity/general/reduced_resources if ticked the animation is gone, but you only see a wireframe of the window if you move it.
2007-09-07T14:53:00.000Z	Jowi	betatest20	typical. gnome (or metacity as the window manager is called) is making it difficult to tweak things nowadays.
2007-09-07T14:54:00.000Z	Jowi	betatest20	you can replace metacity with something else if you like though (I won't go into details about that since you have so many to choose from)
2007-09-07T14:55:00.000Z	betatest20	Jowi	thanks for the info, I will diig deep into that matter
