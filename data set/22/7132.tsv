2006-10-22T15:30:00.000Z	Zambezi		Anyone know rsync? I can't make it work.
2006-10-22T15:30:00.000Z	crimsun	Zambezi	what syntax are you using?
2006-10-22T15:32:00.000Z	Zambezi	crimsun	I'm trying to block external access so I addes my IP in the computer with a special port. And then I wrote: (hold on).
2006-10-22T15:33:00.000Z	Zambezi	crimsun	rsync -avz folder user@ip::/home/user
2006-10-22T15:33:00.000Z	crimsun	Zambezi	terminate the path on the destination properly.
2006-10-22T15:34:00.000Z	crimsun	Zambezi	for more detail, see rsync(1)
2006-10-22T15:34:00.000Z	crimsun	Zambezi	furthermore, make sure tcp/873 is not blocked.
2006-10-22T15:36:00.000Z	Zambezi	crimsun	I'm not comfortable open ports in IPCop, but I haven't blocked it, maybe it is blocked by default.
2006-10-22T15:47:00.000Z	Zambezi	crimsun	I tried now and it starts to send the file, but aborts and says rsync: mkstemp "/USER@IP::/home/.USER.CIgim8" failed: No such file or directory (2). Uppercase means that the original text is replaced.
2006-10-22T15:48:00.000Z	crimsun	Zambezi	that's a syntax issue, then.
2006-10-22T15:49:00.000Z	Zambezi	crimsun	Is it because I put two line in the rsync.conf-file in /etc/?
2006-10-22T15:49:00.000Z	crimsun	Zambezi	what did you modify?
2006-10-22T15:50:00.000Z	Zambezi	crimsun	One second.
2006-10-22T15:51:00.000Z	Zambezi	crimsun	--address=IP // --port=XXXX. IP is IP on this machine. I saved the file as rsync.conf in /etc/. It's a try to block external access.
2006-12-29T16:48:00.000Z	crimsun	Zambezi	mirror.
2006-12-29T16:55:00.000Z	Zambezi	crimsun	Thanks for the help.
2007-03-02T08:19:00.000Z	crimsun	Zambezi	generally one would want a separation of orthogonal services/daemons, yes
2007-03-02T08:20:00.000Z	Zambezi	crimsun	That's why I haven't installed it yet. But I'm not to happy to have five computer running 24/7 when I might have to pay the bill myself.
2007-03-02T08:21:00.000Z	crimsun	Zambezi	then consider using VM images
2007-03-02T08:22:00.000Z	Zambezi	crimsun	I might do. But can I have a webserver and virtual computer on a P3 550 with 512 MB ram or should I add 256 MB? Both computers running Dapper drake without X.
2007-03-02T08:28:00.000Z	crimsun	Zambezi	the more RAM the better
2007-03-02T08:31:00.000Z	Zambezi	crimsun	768 MB ram for two computer without X. It should be fine or I can buy another 256 MB, but not now.
