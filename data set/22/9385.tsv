2004-12-21T06:00:00.000Z	jcole	gen	i've got a useful little mount script i wrote for myself for ubuntu, run it as root and it'll add your partitions - http://jcole.org/mount_all_drives.sh
2004-12-21T06:03:00.000Z	jcole	gen	unmount your extra drives and try that script i gave you
2004-12-21T06:03:00.000Z	jcole	gen	vi /etc/fstab if you want to modify any extras
2004-12-21T06:03:00.000Z	gen	jcole	which script?
2004-12-21T06:04:00.000Z	jcole	gen	http://jcole.org/mount_all_drives.sh

2004-12-21T06:05:00.000Z	jcole	gen	if the drive is already mounted, that script won't mount it again
