2005-08-02T11:51:00.000Z	dabaR	Adross	if you are using gnome, there is a thing that runs with gnome called gnome-volume-manager, and it automounts(or is set to taht by default, anyhow) all shizzes that you connect.
2005-08-02T11:52:00.000Z	dabaR	Adross	if you are not using gnome, well, you could run the volume-manager in a terminal, it should work.
2005-08-02T11:52:00.000Z	Adross	dabaR	no such luck here
2005-08-02T11:52:00.000Z	Adross	dabaR	using gnome, but it did not automount
