2006-01-09T12:16:00.000Z	yaaar		] BreliC[: well, even before i look at that lsmod, i can say with some certainty that you're running without usb-2.0 capability
2006-01-09T12:17:00.000Z	yaaar		] BreliC[: you see how the usb controller lines say "unknown device" ....the autodetect doesn't recognize what usb chipset it is, so presumably it's loading only the most generic/lowest common denominator drivers
2006-01-09T12:17:00.000Z	yaaar		k
2006-01-09T12:17:00.000Z	yaaar		you say it's an nforce4 board
2006-01-09T12:18:00.000Z	] BreliC[	yaaar	yes
2006-01-09T12:19:00.000Z	] BreliC[	yaaar	MSI amd64 nforce4
2006-01-09T12:04:00.000Z	] BreliC[	yaaar	is OpenGL superior to DirectX?
2006-01-09T12:04:00.000Z	] BreliC[	yaaar	because i remember way back that windows games were OpenGL, then they switched
2006-01-09T12:05:00.000Z	] BreliC[	yaaar	hehe, sorry :)
2006-01-09T12:05:00.000Z	] BreliC[	yaaar	ahh, gotcha
2006-01-09T12:07:00.000Z	] BreliC[	yaaar	so an 80MB CD shouldn't take about 4-5 minutes to transfer, right?
2006-01-09T12:08:00.000Z	] BreliC[	yaaar	pretty sure i am.  i wonder if it has anything to do with the fact that my mobo is nForce4.  do i need drivers for it?
2006-01-09T12:08:00.000Z	] BreliC[	yaaar	DVD burner... 16x write, and accesses CD at 52x I think

2006-01-09T12:16:00.000Z	] BreliC[	yaaar	http://pastebin.com/490519 for lsmod
2006-01-09T12:17:00.000Z	] BreliC[	yaaar	i did install the restricted modules
2006-01-09T12:17:00.000Z	] BreliC[	yaaar	hmm, could it be the lack of nForce4 drivers?
2006-01-09T12:17:00.000Z	] BreliC[	yaaar	i know there are some available at the nVidia site but wasn't sure what kind of problems I'd run itno
