2006-10-29T16:31:00.000Z	terrox		whats the easiest way to install nvidia drivers for a fx5200 on Edgy? everything just gives me bad results
2006-10-29T16:32:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	apt-get install nvidia-glx and change nv to nvidia in xorg.conf
2006-10-29T16:32:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	prepend sudo to the command
2006-10-29T16:33:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	i heard about that config thing fucking it up
2006-10-29T16:33:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	well, can you fix that error ?
2006-10-29T16:34:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	no, installing the ubuntu-glx is the same everywhere
2006-10-29T16:34:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	just the sudo configure something is not cool
2006-10-29T16:35:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	can you get your old xorg.conf back ?
2006-10-29T16:35:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	well, then try only changing "nv" to "nvidia" there to activate the driver, i heard that the sudo config thing makes problems, and i always did it that way
2006-10-29T16:37:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	nvidias fault
2006-10-29T16:38:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	please highlight me with my full name
2006-10-29T16:39:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	well the serious people do not care because it isn't oficially supported because its not open source
2006-10-29T16:55:00.000Z	terrox	ProN00b	do I need to install anything else?
2006-10-29T16:56:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	i didn't
2006-10-29T16:57:00.000Z	terrox	ProN00b	k thanks. Funny how none of the guides or anything worked but this simple method does.. I better post that in LEgend forums
2006-10-29T16:59:00.000Z	terrox	ProN00b	you wouldn't happen to have tried Legends in ubuntu have you?
2006-10-29T16:59:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	no, what exactly is that ?
2006-10-29T17:00:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	chmod +x ?
2006-10-29T17:01:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	chmod +x installer.sh
2006-10-29T17:03:00.000Z	terrox	ProN00b	now it says it cant find it
2006-10-29T17:04:00.000Z	ProN00b	terrox	obviously you need to replace installer.sh with the filename of the installer
2006-10-29T17:05:00.000Z	terrox	ProN00b	yeah I know that but its still not finding it after chmod
