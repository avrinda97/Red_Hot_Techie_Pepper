2009-09-03T13:30:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	where is the data that shows benchmark scores on Linux? :/
2009-09-03T13:32:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	you should upgrade to 3.5. it's a lot faster.
2009-09-03T13:32:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	though, it's not as fast as the webkit-based browsers.
2009-09-03T13:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	hm. what graphics card do you have?
2009-09-03T13:33:00.000Z	uni4dfx	Chousuke	GeForce 8600M GT
2009-09-03T13:39:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	it's called shiretoko because Firefox 3.0 is called firefox on ubuntu.
2009-09-03T13:39:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	and since you can have both installed at the same time, you need something to differentiate.
2009-09-03T13:40:00.000Z	uni4dfx	Chousuke	couldn't it just be replaced?
2009-09-03T13:40:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	no, because Jaunty is stable.
2009-09-03T13:40:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	major version upgrades are forbidden.
2009-09-03T13:40:00.000Z	uni4dfx	Chousuke	IMHO, that is just plain stupid
2009-09-03T13:40:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	but people asked for 3.5, so the ubuntu people provided it as an optional install.
2009-09-03T13:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	it's what guarantees that thinks keep working.
2009-09-03T13:41:00.000Z	uni4dfx	Chousuke	well so much for the 'linux choice and configurability'
2009-09-03T13:42:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	bah. that's just bull :)
2009-09-03T13:42:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	you can always backport the package, or install the development version of Ubuntu.
2009-09-03T13:42:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	OR just use the shiretoko package like everyone else...
2009-09-03T13:43:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	the point is, Jaunty is stable, and people need to be able to trust that no major changes happen.
2009-09-03T13:43:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	going from 3.0 to 3.5 is a major change.
2009-09-03T13:43:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	which is why it just can't happen.
2009-09-03T13:44:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	it's different on windows where you have no real package management and your software is always your own responsibility.
2009-09-03T13:44:00.000Z	Chousuke	uni4dfx	but Ubuntu actually helps you to keep your software stable and secure.
