2006-10-17T09:58:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	ReverseBlade	That doesn't answer our questions. ravenwritingdes1 and I want to start in console not a gui login
2006-10-17T09:59:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	ianmacgregor	that you have to remove running gdm from your init scripts. I don't see it is necessary. If you want to fix something you can always try safemod or ctrl F'
2006-10-17T09:59:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	ReverseBlade	I understand that you don't see it as necessary, but the purpose of this channel is to get a question asnwered :)
2006-10-17T10:00:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	ianmacgregor	I can search it in google and tell it to you in 5 min
2006-10-17T10:00:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	ReverseBlade	Please do not recommend automatix in this channel
2006-10-17T10:00:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	ianmacgregor	you can do it as well, it is a simple question
2006-10-17T10:00:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	ianmacgregor	you are not the authority to tell me what I recommend
2006-10-17T10:01:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	ReverseBlade	Please just answer people's questions instead of all this. I don't want to have to place you on my ignore list.
2006-10-17T10:01:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	ianmacgregor	what do you want exactly ?
2006-10-17T10:02:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	ReverseBlade	I'll ask someone else, you don't seem to want to answer my question that will allow me to handle my system the way I want.
2006-10-17T10:03:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	ianmacgregor	ok ask someone else
2006-10-17T10:08:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	ianmacgregor	remove gdm and you will get in console
2006-10-17T10:08:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	ReverseBlade	Thanks
2006-10-18T10:48:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	ReverseBlade	Please do not recommend automatix.. it isn't supported configuration
2006-10-18T10:49:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	ianmacgregor	I disagree

2006-10-18T10:49:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	ReverseBlade	Talk to the ops, then
2006-10-18T10:49:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	ianmacgregor	why ?
2006-10-18T10:50:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	ianmacgregor	why ?
2006-10-18T10:51:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	ianmacgregor	, why mentioning about automatix is a bad thing
2006-10-20T09:31:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	ReverseBlade	Please do NOT recommend automatix in this channel. It isn't supported configuration. Just because something works for you, doesn't mean it will work for others.
2006-10-20T09:31:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	ianmacgregor	I will
