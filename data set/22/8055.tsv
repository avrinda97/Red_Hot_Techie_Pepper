2005-12-07T12:15:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Kayde	That's fine.
2005-12-07T12:16:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Kayde	They are normally built in.
2005-12-07T12:17:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Kayde	What is the issue?

2005-12-07T12:22:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Kayde	You should have to give me an address or something.
2005-12-07T12:27:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Kayde	Found it, wait a sec.
2005-12-07T12:28:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Kayde	is it on all programs, or just the desktop?
2005-12-07T12:30:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Kayde	System->ADminstration->Device Manager, I believe.
2005-12-07T12:31:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Kayde	is checking.
2005-12-07T12:33:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Kayde	It should say Radeon, or GeForce, nVidia, or ATI...
2005-12-07T12:34:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Kayde	Are you on a notebook or desktop?
2005-12-07T12:34:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Kayde	OK.
2005-12-07T12:35:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Kayde	Yes.

2005-12-07T12:48:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Kayde	Application->Accessories->Terminal.
2005-12-07T12:57:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Kayde	I am sure this problem can be fixed at some point.
