2006-12-07T12:16:00.000Z	ArwynH	Bakefy	what is your video card?
2006-12-07T12:16:00.000Z	Bakefy	ArwynH	do you have any ideas... it says that if I get out of opengl mode it will run faster

2006-12-07T12:17:00.000Z	Bakefy	ArwynH	my card may be old, but google earth works on windows just fine
2006-12-07T12:17:00.000Z	ArwynH	Bakefy	hmm a it dated, but I'm not sure of the specs of google earth. What drivers are you running?
2006-12-07T12:18:00.000Z	ArwynH	Bakefy	the defaults?
2006-12-07T12:18:00.000Z	Bakefy	ArwynH	yes... i havent changed anything
2006-12-07T12:18:00.000Z	ArwynH	Bakefy	then changing drivers will probably help.
2006-12-07T12:18:00.000Z	Bakefy		does nvida offer drivers?
2006-12-07T12:18:00.000Z	ArwynH	Bakefy	i havn't done this myself, but there is a howto. one minute and i'll look up the link.
2006-12-07T12:19:00.000Z	ArwynH	Bakefy	yes. but it's easier to get them through ubuntu, i'll look up the link.
2006-12-07T12:20:00.000Z	ArwynH	Bakefy	what ubuntu version are you running?
2006-12-07T12:21:00.000Z	Bakefy		the newest

2006-12-07T12:24:00.000Z	ArwynH	Bakefy	by all I'm assuming you have more than 2. I've heard it is possible, but I've never tried or heard how to do it. Sorry.
