2005-12-07T12:52:00.000Z	trappist	Mabus06	it doesn't work like that.  most apps have many components that get installed into their appropriate locations.
2005-12-07T14:21:00.000Z	Mabus06	trappist	have you read it?
2005-12-07T14:19:00.000Z	trappist	Mabus06	don't tell people not to tell people to rtfm.  often it's exactly what they need.
2005-12-07T14:21:00.000Z	trappist	Mabus06	the code of conduct instructs you not to point people toward documentation?
2005-12-07T14:21:00.000Z	Mabus06	trappist	code of conduct tells people to be friendly, not insult people and be disrespectful
2005-12-07T14:22:00.000Z	trappist	Mabus06	read and signed.  I would submit that telling people it's unhelpful to point other people to documentation is disrespectful.
2005-12-07T14:22:00.000Z	Mabus06	trappist	okay well you're submitting nonsense
2005-12-07T14:23:00.000Z	trappist	Mabus06	'rtfm n00b' would have been unhelpful.  what he said wasn't.
2005-12-07T14:24:00.000Z	Mabus06	trappist	it wasn't helpful. I'm the judge. If you ask a question, you're the judge of what's helpful. If you signed the CoC please adhere to it and stop harassing me.
