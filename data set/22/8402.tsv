2007-04-28T16:25:00.000Z	ciga		anyone knows how to boot up with kernel 2.4 on ubuntu?
2007-04-28T16:26:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	ciga	boot ubuntu hoary hedgehog?
2007-04-28T16:26:00.000Z	ciga		zcat[1] : I have edgy.
2007-04-28T16:26:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	ciga	there's possibly still a 2.4 kernel package, check the repos.. but why would you want to ?
2007-04-28T16:27:00.000Z	ciga		zcat[1] , kevi1 : I compiled my own, and boot with 2.4.27-2-686 (it is in edgy), but still does not work.
2007-04-28T16:28:00.000Z	ciga		zcat[1] , kevi1 : I got an error installing the kernel "W: kernel 2.4.27-2-686 too old for initramfs on i386", so I tried to compile my own, but it says "FATAL: kernel too old"
2007-04-28T16:28:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	yup
2007-04-28T16:28:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	ciga	that seems clear enough :)
2007-04-28T16:29:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	ciga	sounds like you need to build in whatever filesystem support and other options are required, and build a kernel without initramfs support
2007-04-28T16:29:00.000Z	ciga		zcat[1] : what? it is in the offical distro and you cannot boot up with it? :) would it supposed to be clear?
2007-04-28T16:30:00.000Z	ciga		zcat[1] : so you think disabling initramfs support would solve my problem?
2007-04-28T16:30:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	ciga	the error message suggests that..
2007-04-28T16:30:00.000Z	ciga		zcat[1] : okay, I give it a try.
2007-04-28T16:31:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	having 2.4.27-2-686 in the official distro is only a trap then? :)
2007-04-28T16:31:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	performance.
2007-04-28T16:31:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	ciga	you might have to play with the options in /boot/grub/menu.lst too, I'm not sure 2.4 can handle things like filesystem labels either
2007-04-28T16:31:00.000Z	ciga		zcat[1] : I have done that also.
2007-04-28T16:32:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	I have an old box that might work better with 2.4
2007-04-28T16:32:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	I used to have 2.4 on debian. I want to give it a try.
2007-04-28T16:33:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	ciga	You can probably make it work but if you plan to use it, you'll be aware of the differences and what 2.4 kernels can't do that your ubuntu system will be expecting it to handle..
2007-04-28T16:33:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	gw/fw/mail/smb
2007-04-28T16:34:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	ciga	personally I'd use something like xubuntu or even puppy linux on an old box, rather than downgrading the kernel
