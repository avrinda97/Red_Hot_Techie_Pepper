2008-12-10T20:45:00.000Z	jolter		is there any reason to get the ubuntu 8.10 64bit version?
2008-12-10T20:46:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	jolter	over 2gb of ram?
2008-12-10T20:46:00.000Z	jolter	fivetwentysix	no 512mb ram
2008-12-10T20:48:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	jolter	stick with 32-bit, 64-bit applications tend to use more memory since their long variables can hold much larger numbers which means taking up much more memory even if it's not being fully used
2008-12-10T20:48:00.000Z	jolter	fivetwentysix	yeah i will do so :)
2008-12-10T20:49:00.000Z	jolter	fivetwentysix	I would like to install ubuntu 8.10 on my mothers HP 6715s laptop but it does not work @ all :(
2008-12-10T20:50:00.000Z	jolter	fivetwentysix	I really dont know but i've been doing some readings about hp laptops and linux and that it's a bad combination but I dont know if that's true
2008-12-10T20:51:00.000Z	jolter	fivetwentysix	but the PcLinuxOS did work on that laptop though
2008-12-10T20:51:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	jolter	It sounds like it's a old laptop and ubuntu doesn't detect the display card or monitor.
2008-12-10T20:51:00.000Z	jolter	fivetwentysix	but when I try to run the Ubuntu Live CD I get lots of error messages
2008-12-10T20:51:00.000Z	jolter	fivetwentysix	well it's and AMD 3800+
2008-12-10T20:53:00.000Z	jolter	fivetwentysix	but the last version i've tried was hardy
2008-12-10T20:53:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	jolter	8.10 is much more polished and has much better hardware support
2008-12-10T20:54:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	jolter	you should give it a try.
2008-12-10T20:54:00.000Z	jolter	fivetwentysix	yeah i'm going to burn 8.10 right now
2008-12-10T20:54:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	jolter	my same computer im using now use to have wireless conflicts, graphic card glitches, and tons of other issues
2008-12-10T20:55:00.000Z	jolter	fivetwentysix	ok
2008-12-10T20:55:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	jolter	I just switched back to Ubuntu from Vista and I think my hair isnt turning gray
2008-12-10T20:55:00.000Z	jolter	fivetwentysix	haha :D
2008-12-10T20:56:00.000Z	jolter	fivetwentysix	well in about 10 minutes i'm gonna give that laptop another try
2008-12-10T20:57:00.000Z	jolter	fivetwentysix	Ubuntu 8.10 works really well on my Toshiba Tecra computer :)
2008-12-10T20:57:00.000Z	jolter	fivetwentysix	even though the computer is old :)
