2009-11-25T13:12:00.000Z	stonewash	SpaceGhostC2C	good evening
2009-11-25T13:12:00.000Z	stonewash	SpaceGhostC2C	how to add/enable default root account
2009-11-25T13:12:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	stonewash	Well I'll give you the link. But it's not really something good to enable
2009-11-25T13:13:00.000Z	stonewash	SpaceGhostC2C	right now i am using root shell.
2009-11-25T13:13:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	stonewash	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo
2009-11-25T13:13:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	stonewash	Why are you using a root shell? Why not use sudo? It's more secure.
2009-11-25T13:14:00.000Z	stonewash	SpaceGhostC2C	but even this account has read only permission to /etc/groups and ...
2009-11-25T13:14:00.000Z	stonewash	SpaceGhostC2C	/etc/group and /etc/gshadow files are cleared
2009-11-25T13:14:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	stonewash	Then you need to add the user to the sudoers.
2009-11-25T13:15:00.000Z	stonewash	SpaceGhostC2C	it looks like system is locked
2009-11-25T13:15:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	stonewash	as root, type this command and add your normal user to the sudoers. visudo
2009-11-25T13:15:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	stonewash	what do you mean by locked?
2009-11-25T13:16:00.000Z	stonewash	SpaceGhostC2C	thanks
2009-11-25T13:16:00.000Z	stonewash	SpaceGhostC2C	brb
2009-11-25T13:23:00.000Z	stonewash	SpaceGhostC2C	visudo return -- read-only-filesystem
2009-11-25T13:23:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	stonewash	is this filesystem you're in a ubuntucd?
2009-11-25T13:23:00.000Z	stonewash	SpaceGhostC2C	no
2009-11-25T13:24:00.000Z	stonewash	SpaceGhostC2C	this is clean 9.10 install
2009-11-25T13:24:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	stonewash	I know it sounds annoying, but try to burn the disk again, then reinstall. Sometimes it's simpler than working it out. If you'd like to work it out send me a PM.
2009-11-25T13:25:00.000Z	stonewash	SpaceGhostC2C	tried to add a new least privileged user. and script deleted all groups
2009-11-25T13:25:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	stonewash	I suggest for best use of your time, to reinstall ubuntu and if the problem persists, then come here.
