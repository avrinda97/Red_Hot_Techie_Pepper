2010-09-07T17:58:00.000Z	gschwepp	whatlinux	if you boot your system from a 10 gb usb stick you must config your bios ...
2010-09-07T17:58:00.000Z	gschwepp	whatlinux	so if you use a external hdd via usb. you can boot it if you get it into your bootsequence in you bios
2010-09-07T18:00:00.000Z	gschwepp	whatlinux	you must connect you 10 gb hdd in any way to your computer. if you want to boot it.
