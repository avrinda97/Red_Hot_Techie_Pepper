2010-05-19T14:40:00.000Z	K10		whats going on here?
2010-05-19T14:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	K10	the kernel dropped some buffer cache to load VBox
2010-05-19T14:41:00.000Z	K10	erUSUL	but the buffer and caches are not changed, only the used memory (second line)?
2010-05-19T14:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	K10	1114 --> 917 ?
2010-05-19T14:42:00.000Z	K10	erUSUL	yes
2010-05-19T14:42:00.000Z	K10	erUSUL	and as i know, in free the first line includes buffer/caches, the second line exclude this
2010-05-19T14:47:00.000Z	K10	erUSUL	maybe i missinterpret them?
2010-05-19T14:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	K10	the question is why you have more free memory after starting VirtualBox ?
2010-05-19T14:49:00.000Z	K10	erUSUL	exactly
2010-05-19T14:50:00.000Z	K10		thats why iam asking?
2010-05-19T14:50:00.000Z	K10		:D
2010-05-19T14:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	K10	then i dunno; but why do you care ?
2010-05-19T14:54:00.000Z	K10	erUSUL	?
2010-05-19T14:55:00.000Z	K10	erUSUL	because im interessted on this...its a little bit strange :D
2010-05-19T14:55:00.000Z	K10		to start a program and get memory free
2010-05-19T14:55:00.000Z	K10		:D
2010-05-19T14:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	K10	it is not easy to know why the kernel decided to free the memory ....
2010-05-19T14:56:00.000Z	K10	erUSUL	ok, thank you
