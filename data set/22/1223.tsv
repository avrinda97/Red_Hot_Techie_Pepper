2010-08-11T04:43:00.000Z	guest99		I can't boot to windows. Help please?
2010-08-11T04:44:00.000Z	profxavier	guest99	new install ?
2010-08-11T04:44:00.000Z	guest99	profxavier	yes new install
2010-08-11T04:44:00.000Z	profxavier	guest99	which did you install second ?
2010-08-11T04:44:00.000Z	guest99	profxavier	linux
2010-08-11T04:44:00.000Z	profxavier	guest99	what seems to be the problem then, in detail, all on one line
2010-08-11T04:45:00.000Z	guest99	profxavier	I have to menu choice, but when booting to it i get "unknown device" and "unknown partition" then it goes back to grub
2010-08-11T04:46:00.000Z	profxavier	guest99	did you install Ubuntu on the Windows partition?
2010-08-11T04:46:00.000Z	guest99	profxavier	windows is on the first drive, ubuntu on the second drive
2010-08-11T04:46:00.000Z	profxavier	guest99	so you believe the Windows partition is still intact ?
2010-08-11T04:47:00.000Z	guest99	profxavier	it is.
2010-08-11T04:47:00.000Z	profxavier	guest99	and GRUB [ if that is your bootloader], offers Windows as an option, but will not boot into it?
2010-08-11T04:48:00.000Z	guest99	profxavier	yes grub has the option but errors out when booting to it
2010-08-11T04:48:00.000Z	profxavier	guest99	did you see anything unusual during the installation, to cause GRUB to be configured incorrect ?
2010-08-11T04:49:00.000Z	guest99	profxavier	no pretty normal install
2010-08-11T04:49:00.000Z	guest99	profxavier	the only thing not default was I choose to install to the second drive rather than resize windows
2010-08-11T04:50:00.000Z	profxavier	guest99	unusual, do you have just one drive, or multiples ? [with the OSes on it]
2010-08-11T04:51:00.000Z	guest99	profxavier	2 drives. a 320 as the first with windows xp on ntfs. the second is 2 TB with a swap and a / as ext4
2010-08-11T04:52:00.000Z	profxavier	guest99	can you pull the Ubuntu drive and confirm you can launch into windows, then you will know its an issue with GRUB
2010-08-11T04:53:00.000Z	guest99	profxavier	I have run the windows recovery and did a fixmbr. It booted windows. Then I used a live cd to reinstall grub, and now I'm back to where I started. So yes it is a grub problem.
2010-08-11T04:54:00.000Z	guest99	profxavier	yes it does work
2010-08-11T04:55:00.000Z	profxavier	guest99	ok, so it is an issue with GRUB, I dont believe I can help you further with it, sorry
