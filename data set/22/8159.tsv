2005-10-14T09:15:00.000Z	chavo	tuxedo_kamen	did you mount the iso at /mnt/cdrom?
2005-10-14T09:17:00.000Z	chavo	tuxedo_kamen	what happens when you run apt-cdrom add ?
2005-10-14T09:18:00.000Z	tuxedo_kamen	chavo	I get this error, among others -> E: Failed to mount the cdrom.
2005-10-14T09:18:00.000Z	chavo	tuxedo_kamen	I know I've done this, but I think I'm forgetting something
2005-10-14T09:19:00.000Z	chavo	tuxedo_kamen	my bad, mount it at /cdrom and it will work

2005-10-14T09:28:00.000Z	chavo	tuxedo_kamen	o_0
2005-10-14T09:29:00.000Z	chavo	tuxedo_kamen	so it worked?
2005-10-14T09:33:00.000Z	tuxedo_kamen	chavo	but now I have another problem.... how can I remove all the packages I don't use? do I have to do it by hand?
2005-10-14T09:33:00.000Z	chavo	tuxedo_kamen	well yeah
2005-10-14T09:34:00.000Z	tuxedo_kamen	chavo	but is it possible that I remove something that will make my ubuntu don't work anymore?
2005-10-14T09:34:00.000Z	chavo	tuxedo_kamen	no, it won't remove anything necessary for the computer to work
2005-10-14T09:49:00.000Z	chavo	tuxedo_kamen	it overwrites the old stuff
2005-10-14T09:50:00.000Z	chavo	tuxedo_kamen	why?
2005-10-14T09:51:00.000Z	chavo	tuxedo_kamen	-rw-r--r--  1 root root 1266857 Aug 30 19:14 /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.12-8-k7
2005-10-14T09:52:00.000Z	chavo	tuxedo_kamen	you can remove it but it really doesn't matter.
