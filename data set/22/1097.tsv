2010-10-11T20:36:00.000Z	soc		well, i need some of the java's NIO2 libraries, which are only available on jdk7
2010-10-11T20:36:00.000Z	soc		nad i removed jdk6, but there are still things on the system, as it seem,s
2010-10-11T20:38:00.000Z	soc		if i want to remove them, synaptic wants to reinstall openjdk
2010-10-11T20:38:00.000Z	soc		not from synaptic i guess
2010-10-11T20:40:00.000Z	soc		forcefully removing packages does
2010-10-11T20:41:00.000Z	soc		looool ... and of course, if i try to remove openjdk, it wants to install sun-java again ... WTF?
2010-10-11T20:42:00.000Z	darael	soc	If you have aptitude installed (ie not-maverick) you can run "aptitude why sun-java" (if not, you could always add aptitude :) to find out what it is that's depending on java.
2010-10-11T20:46:00.000Z	soc	darael	ok, i could remove it now with aptitude
2010-10-11T20:47:00.000Z	darael	soc	Interesting, I wasn't expecting that.
2010-10-11T20:47:00.000Z	darael	soc	Probably some of them were depending on sun-java.
2010-10-11T20:48:00.000Z	soc	darael	well, it will be easier to download and install maven, eclipse, netbeans myself than teaching ubuntu to use the java version _i_ tell it
2010-10-11T20:48:00.000Z	darael	soc	...Or more likely, on some virtual package /provided/ by sun-java and openjdk.
2010-10-11T20:50:00.000Z	soc	darael	*sigh* ... i can't install openjdk-7-jre, because that thing suggests icedtea6-plugin ...
2010-10-11T20:50:00.000Z	darael	soc	You can install with --no-suggests (I think) since suggests aren't hard depends.
2010-10-11T20:50:00.000Z	soc	darael	with aptitude again, then?
2010-10-11T20:51:00.000Z	darael	soc	I think so.  Or you can just add "icedtea6-plugin-" to the end of the install command with aptitude /or/ apt-get (but note the trailing -)
2010-10-11T20:52:00.000Z	soc	darael	icedtea6-plugin pulls in the whole openjdk6 stack
2010-10-11T20:52:00.000Z	soc	darael	 sudo aptitude install --no-suggests openjdk-7-jre  <-- doesn't work, "aptitude: unrecognised option '--no-suggests'"
2010-10-11T20:53:00.000Z	darael	soc	Ah.
2010-10-11T20:55:00.000Z	darael	soc	Try running "sudo aptitude install openjdk-7-jre icedtea6-plugin:" (with the trailing : - it tells it to leave that package in the state it's in.)
2010-10-11T20:55:00.000Z	soc	darael	no, still wants to install those java6 things
2010-10-11T20:56:00.000Z	darael	soc	Hmm, I'm nearly out of ideas, then.  You could try telling it (at the y/n prompt) :<packagename> to get it to keep those packages uninstalled.
