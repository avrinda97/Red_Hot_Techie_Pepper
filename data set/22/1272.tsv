2010-10-17T21:55:00.000Z	StaRetji1		Folks, how to stop ubuntu from popping up "System policy prevents modification of system settings" whenever I want to connect to a hotspot. Thx!
2010-10-17T21:56:00.000Z	StaRetji1		it asks password each time, I would really like to stop that operation once for good
2010-10-17T21:56:00.000Z	linduxed	StaRetji1	is it a regular install?
2010-10-17T21:57:00.000Z	StaRetji1	linduxed	nope, minimal ubuntu and the xfce4 install via apt-get
2010-10-17T21:57:00.000Z	StaRetji1	linduxed	and thx for reply :)
2010-10-17T21:57:00.000Z	StaRetji1	linduxed	maverick, latest
2010-10-17T21:58:00.000Z	linduxed	StaRetji1	i guess it could have something to do with the session not being authenticated
2010-10-17T21:58:00.000Z	linduxed	StaRetji1	what DM are you using?
2010-10-17T21:58:00.000Z	StaRetji1	linduxed	actually, I've done autologin. Ehm, DM?
2010-10-17T21:59:00.000Z	linduxed		desktop manager
2010-10-17T21:59:00.000Z	StaRetji1		xfce4 gnome
2010-10-17T21:59:00.000Z	linduxed		stuff like GDM, KDM, SliM
2010-10-17T21:59:00.000Z	StaRetji1		gdm
2010-10-17T22:01:00.000Z	linduxed		it sounds like it's a problem with the authentication, i'd guess that because it autologins it doesn't start an authenticated session
2010-10-17T22:01:00.000Z	linduxed		this is just a guess theough
2010-10-17T22:01:00.000Z	linduxed	StaRetji1	forgot to highligt
2010-10-17T22:02:00.000Z	linduxed	StaRetji1	if it is something like that you need to start xfce with ck-launch-session
2010-10-17T22:02:00.000Z	StaRetji1	linduxed	I could agree, how can I autologin with password, or to automatically authenticate. This is making problem, I have xbmc autostarting on my netbook and it hangs because of this. It asks for password and starts xbmc. If I could remove this somehow
2010-10-17T22:04:00.000Z	StaRetji1	linduxed	I've ran ck-launch-session from terminal, but it is still the same
2010-10-17T22:12:00.000Z	StaRetji1	linduxed	I've added .xinitrc to my home dir and it starts xfce4 like this: exec ck-launch-session startxfce4 However "System policy prevents modification of system settings" still comes up :/
2010-10-17T22:16:00.000Z	linduxed	StaRetji1	then i have no idea
2010-10-17T22:17:00.000Z	StaRetji1	linduxed	ok, thx mate
