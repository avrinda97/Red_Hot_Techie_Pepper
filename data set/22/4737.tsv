2008-03-07T00:27:00.000Z	david__	isaacj87	yes, the dock
2008-03-07T00:28:00.000Z	isaacj87	david__	like Jack_Sparrow said...use cairo-dock or Avant Window Navigator
2008-03-07T00:32:00.000Z	isaacj87	david__	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/cairo-dock/
2008-03-07T00:32:00.000Z	isaacj87	david__	you can find the deb there
2008-03-07T00:32:00.000Z	david__	isaacj87	exactly, do i need to install cairo dock and also plugins or only the first one?
2008-03-07T00:32:00.000Z	isaacj87	david__	install cairo-dock first...than the plugins
2008-03-07T00:34:00.000Z	isaacj87	david__	not sure. but my guess is extra stuff like battery monitor, weather...stuff like that

2008-03-07T00:40:00.000Z	david__	isaacj87	yes, i think i need to run cairo-dock in terminal
2008-03-07T00:41:00.000Z	isaacj87	david__	no, just press alt+f2
2008-03-07T00:41:00.000Z	isaacj87	david__	then type: cairo-dock
