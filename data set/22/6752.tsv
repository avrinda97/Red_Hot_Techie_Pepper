2006-08-05T08:28:00.000Z	vinibaggio		Hi, I'm new to Linux and Ubuntu and I'm having trouble to use java-based applications. I'm trying to use jEdit but I can't type double quotes ("), only single quotes '. I'm using us-international keyboard layout...
2006-08-05T08:30:00.000Z	madnificent	vinibaggio	you can change the layout in gnome, and read where the characters are :)
2006-08-05T08:30:00.000Z	madnificent	vinibaggio	I'm not on ubuntu now, so it's a bit hard to help you
2006-08-05T08:30:00.000Z	madnificent	vinibaggio	if that doesn't work, you can check which characters you get trough the command line (but that's evil)
2006-08-05T08:30:00.000Z	vinibaggio	madnificent	oops, I'm using KDE... Well all GTK and QT applications works with " as you can see :) only java applications. I have the same trouble with netbeans
2006-08-05T08:31:00.000Z	madnificent	vinibaggio	eww, that's evil
2006-08-05T08:31:00.000Z	vinibaggio	madnificent	I can't even try a hello world example without copying and pasting only....
2006-08-05T08:32:00.000Z	madnificent	vinibaggio	did you try netbeans?
2006-08-05T08:32:00.000Z	madnificent	vinibaggio	or does that give you the same problem
2006-08-05T08:32:00.000Z	vinibaggio	madnificent	yes, same problem
2006-08-05T08:32:00.000Z	vinibaggio	madnificent	I didn't try eclipse.... Lemme check, but i think it will work
2006-08-05T08:33:00.000Z	madnificent	vinibaggio	in that case, it doesn't solve your problem, but you can get further...
2006-08-05T08:33:00.000Z	madnificent	vinibaggio	maybe you need to install an other java vm . . . (the official one might work)
2006-08-05T08:34:00.000Z	vinibaggio	madnificent	I dont think i have many choices, but I think it will work since its GTK... Only Swing (or the kit jedit and netbeans uses)
2006-08-05T08:34:00.000Z	vinibaggio	madnificent	Thats a possibility, I'm using sun's
2006-08-05T08:34:00.000Z	madnificent	vinibaggio	hmmm, suns should work :)
2006-08-05T08:36:00.000Z	vinibaggio	madnificent	Ok, eclipse works, thanks! But well.... The problem is veeeery weird
2006-08-05T08:37:00.000Z	madnificent	vinibaggio	you can get further... I do wonder what the problem is (maybe a configuration here or there)
2006-08-05T08:38:00.000Z	vinibaggio	madnificent	Can you tell me so I can investigate?
2006-08-05T08:39:00.000Z	madnificent	vinibaggio	I honoustly can't tell you... there must be some configuration file conserning java... but I don't know where it is, and what is in it... so...
2006-08-05T08:39:00.000Z	vinibaggio	madnificent	Ok, no problem, thanks!
2006-08-05T08:40:00.000Z	madnificent	vinibaggio	np
