2007-07-21T07:31:00.000Z	jmchaffie		anyone willing to answer a most likely simple ahoutcast question?
2007-07-21T07:31:00.000Z	jmchaffie		*shoutcast
2007-07-21T07:32:00.000Z	jmchaffie		I tried several times and noone answered is why. - question slearly stated to follow :)
2007-07-21T07:34:00.000Z	jmchaffie		I've tried both icecaast and shoutcast + idjc. works great local network. I've done everything I can find as far as making sure porst 8000-8001 are open on the router, but no go for outsiders. any ideas?
2007-07-21T07:34:00.000Z	jmchaffie		Wondering if anyone has had same experience and it's something simple I probably have overlooked.
2007-07-21T07:36:00.000Z	jmchaffie		port forwarding is enabled, however I'm unsure of dmz. I will have to check that, had not heard of that until now.
2007-07-21T07:36:00.000Z	jmchaffie		I will have to research it before I do it. I've not heard of it until you mentioned it just now.
2007-07-21T07:37:00.000Z	jmchaffie		It's just odd that everything seems to work great, and I get "touches" from the shoutcast server (yp server) but nobody can get to me)
2007-07-21T07:38:00.000Z	bulmer	jmchaffie	do you have a firewall rule that prevents those ports from being hit?
2007-07-21T07:49:00.000Z	bulmer	jmchaffie	okay well that tells you, no rules so it is open
2007-07-21T07:44:00.000Z	bulmer	jmchaffie	type iptables -vL  to see if any rules are set
2007-07-21T07:49:00.000Z	jmchaffie	bulmer	(sorry, forgot name intro) well, there are three entries, INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD, with "policy ACCEPT 0 packets, o bytes) and no information below the headers on all of those.
2007-07-21T07:50:00.000Z	jmchaffie	bulmer	ok that's good. Well, I'm stumped then. I've worked on it for hours. a couple of days now actually. I guess I'll keep poking at it. Research the dmz thing.
2007-07-21T07:51:00.000Z	bulmer	jmchaffie	what kind of dsl modem/router you have in front of your ubuntu?
2007-07-21T07:53:00.000Z	jmchaffie	bulmer	It's a Buffalo AirStation
2007-07-21T07:53:00.000Z	jmchaffie	bulmer	Also, one protocol I'm not familiar with is UPnP - it is enabled, can this cause any grief?
2007-07-21T07:53:00.000Z	bulmer	jmchaffie	i dont know about that protocol either
2007-07-21T07:55:00.000Z	jmchaffie	bulmer	I figured it was... just wasn't sure if it would cause issues. I have everything setup static though.
2007-07-21T07:57:00.000Z	bulmer	jmchaffie	does your AP allocates or reserves those ip range as static ?
2007-07-21T07:59:00.000Z	jmchaffie	bulmer	Well, I setup my machine as a static address, then setup the ip range in the router... I'll check but not sure there is a specific 'static' setting for range... then I have port forwarding for MY ip.
2007-07-21T08:01:00.000Z	bulmer	jmchaffie	yeah check those..and i have not used the port forwarding on those kind of routers, i normally put my linux (as router with iptables) in the dmz
2007-07-21T08:02:00.000Z	jmchaffie	bulmer	ok cool, thanks tons. Gives me much more to go on for now. At least I now have a new angle to go on instead of beating my head against the wall on the same stuff! :)
