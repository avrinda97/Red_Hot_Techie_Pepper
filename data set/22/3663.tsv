2008-07-17T22:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	chriswr	wubi is not the normal partition type install....  At best I can see it for testing, but NOT for everyday use
2008-07-17T22:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	chriswr	not full versions the way I assume you are thinking
2008-07-17T22:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	chriswr	you can install XP in vbox.. but it is not full featured with directx and all of that
2008-07-17T22:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	chriswr	yes..

2008-07-17T23:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	chriswr	There are some workarounds on the wubi site but best to start over
2008-07-17T23:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	chriswr	avoid installing from inside windows with wubi
2008-07-17T23:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	chriswr	yes, you can still dual boot if you do a normal install on a sep partition
2008-07-19T06:08:00.000Z	chriswr	Jack_Sparrow	what do xmms them files edit?
