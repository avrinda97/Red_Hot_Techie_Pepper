2006-11-30T09:48:00.000Z	Lovloss		That makes me sad, though. because windows vista's going to be offering the effects
2006-11-30T09:49:00.000Z	Lovloss		i dont like them being ahead :(
2006-11-30T09:49:00.000Z	Lovloss		well how can i safely unisntall it anyway
2006-11-30T09:50:00.000Z	Lovloss		it really bound itself to my graphics setup
2006-11-30T09:52:00.000Z	Lovloss		If i uninstall beryl, will i have to reinstall any graphics software? i imagine it wrote over my nvidia drivers
2006-11-30T09:52:00.000Z	Lovloss		Okay now i want it
2006-11-30T09:53:00.000Z	Lovloss		Oy, there's soooo much stuff to back up though
2006-11-30T09:54:00.000Z	Lovloss		thank you mheath. it sounds easier
2006-11-30T09:54:00.000Z	Lovloss		lol
2006-11-30T09:55:00.000Z	Lovloss		so aiglx is like beryl, it flips your screen and does that zoom thing?
2006-11-30T09:55:00.000Z	kitche	Lovloss	aiglx is like XGL
2006-11-30T09:55:00.000Z	kitche	Lovloss	beryl is like compiz
2006-11-30T09:56:00.000Z	kitche	Lovloss	either one but I would recommand beryl since compiz dis missign a lot of plugins
2006-11-30T09:58:00.000Z	kitche	Lovloss	beryl is actually good but it's meant to work with kde xfce or gnome really
2006-11-30T10:00:00.000Z	kitche	Lovloss	how are you trying to start beryl are you logging into gnome then running beryl-manager? or are you doing it another way just wondering sicne I usualyl log in to X then run beryl-manager & in a console
2006-11-30T10:00:00.000Z	Lovloss	kitche	i just type 'beryl' into a terminal and it starts up....
2006-11-30T10:02:00.000Z	Lovloss	kitche	well ill be a monkey's uncle
2006-11-30T10:03:00.000Z	kitche	Lovloss	beryl-manager starts up the whole beryl system which makes it more complete
2006-11-30T10:03:00.000Z	kitche	Lovloss	you can make one
2006-12-03T12:03:00.000Z	kitche	Lovloss	do sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop that will stop X and take you to the console
2006-12-05T09:20:00.000Z	kitche	Lovloss	well if you don't know what you did then no one else will either
2006-12-05T09:21:00.000Z	kitche	Lovloss	log is in /var/log don't know the sub directory or if apt uses it
