2005-11-24T15:18:00.000Z	Nytryx		ok so my PPC wont boot from the ubuntu install cd iso ppc that i downloaded any suggestions?
2005-11-24T15:20:00.000Z	Nytryx		ok can i have some help please?
2005-11-24T15:20:00.000Z	Nytryx		probably
2005-11-24T15:21:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	What PPC is it; at what speed and with what software did you burn the iso?
2005-11-24T15:22:00.000Z	Nytryx	cafuego	it a Power mac 7200/120 i burned with nero and at i think 24x down to 8x
2005-11-24T15:22:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	Yeah, OldWorld; they need special care (and the 7200 range needs BURNING)
2005-11-24T15:23:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	You need a smallish (100 Mb) MacOS partition with: 1 BootX, 2 The install kernel 3. The installer initrd image or a 'miboot' floppy.
2005-11-24T15:24:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	Yeah, odlworld macs are FUN!
2005-11-24T15:24:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	Probably reburn the ISO and 4X and try it on the iBook again
2005-11-24T15:25:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	You're going to cry about slowness when eventually running it on the 7200.
2005-11-24T15:25:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	You hold own c until it's booted off the cd.
2005-11-24T15:26:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	The 7200 is going to do poo even with xfce. I have 2 of them here to back that claim up :-)
2005-11-24T15:27:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	Sorry, they're 7100/80's (Just checked)
2005-11-24T15:28:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	Yes, but THAT uses a G4. The 7200 has a 601.
2005-11-24T15:30:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	You *can* make it work, but I'd probably not use X. You need to use BootX and a macOS aprtition to make that thing run Linux. it's not going to ever boot frm the CD.
2005-11-24T15:31:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	here ya go: http://lists.debian.org/debian-powerpc/2003/10/msg00478.html
2005-11-24T15:33:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	I concur.
2005-12-20T17:38:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	it's in dapper, currently NOT stable.
2005-12-20T17:44:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	no, just checking component pricing
2005-12-20T06:00:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	No, it was designed properly and not hacked in :-)
2005-12-20T06:02:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	Default Gnome has Application -> Internet -> Terminal Server Client, which does windows remote desktop.
2005-12-20T06:03:00.000Z	cafuego	Nytryx	if you want to use vnc or freenx, you'll need to install those on both linux and Windows.
