2006-10-26T07:45:00.000Z	redcard	sethk	Personally, I'm liking it.
2006-10-26T07:47:00.000Z	sethk	redcard	u+rw,a+x
2006-10-26T07:47:00.000Z	redcard	sethk	But what if I'm such a pro that I automatically know what that is numerically?
2006-10-26T07:48:00.000Z	sethk	redcard	then you are deceiving yourself
2006-10-26T07:48:00.000Z	redcard	sethk	No.  I think you're deceiving people.
2006-10-26T07:48:00.000Z	sethk	redcard	not at all.  go to any uni, ask any professor
2006-10-26T07:49:00.000Z	redcard	sethk	I advise you to check out the code, then :)  It converts all those u+rw's and such to numbers.
2006-10-26T07:49:00.000Z	sethk	redcard	of course it does
2006-10-26T07:50:00.000Z	sethk	redcard	that's the entire point
2006-10-26T07:50:00.000Z	sethk	redcard	you don't get it at _all_
2006-10-26T07:50:00.000Z	sethk	redcard	the program will convert it correctly.  that's why you use symbols
2006-10-26T07:50:00.000Z	redcard	sethk	Oh.. so now you're insulting the intelligence of someone you've NEVER met.
2006-10-26T07:50:00.000Z	sethk	redcard	has nothing to do with intelligence
2006-10-26T07:50:00.000Z	redcard	sethk	Then you're calling me ignorant?
2006-10-26T07:50:00.000Z	sethk	redcard	no, just wrong
2006-10-26T07:51:00.000Z	sethk	redcard	but that's ok, it's very common with younger sys admins.  they learn, eventually
2006-10-26T07:51:00.000Z	redcard	sethk	You're cute.  How long have you been doing the linux thing?
2006-10-26T07:51:00.000Z	sethk	redcard	well, I've been doing unix for about 35 years
2006-10-26T07:51:00.000Z	sethk	redcard	linux hasn't been around that long, of course,
2006-10-26T07:52:00.000Z	sethk	redcard	I have not insulted anyone, and it would really be best if you would restrain yourself.
2006-10-26T07:58:00.000Z	sethk	redcard	some of the extensions I like aren't available for ff 2 yet, also.
2006-10-26T08:06:00.000Z	sethk	redcard	why?  you don't need to use the RSS
