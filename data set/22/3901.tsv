2008-04-30T23:34:00.000Z	soundray	Sherry345	when it enters busybox, there should be some sort of error or explanation
2008-04-30T23:36:00.000Z	Sherry345	soundray	can u tell me how to load ubuntu :(
2008-04-30T23:38:00.000Z	soundray	Sherry345	it's too bad that there doesn't seem to be a clue as to why it starts busybox rather than Ubuntu.
2008-04-30T23:38:00.000Z	soundray	Sherry345	have you tried booting from a CD?
2008-04-30T23:41:00.000Z	soundray	Sherry345	would it be terrible to just try and install it again?
2008-04-30T23:41:00.000Z	Sherry345	soundray	i have to kill myself :D
2008-04-30T23:42:00.000Z	soundray	Sherry345	regard that option as a last resort please ;)
2008-04-30T23:43:00.000Z	Sherry345	soundray	i am uninstalling it
2008-04-30T23:44:00.000Z	soundray	Sherry345	no, it isn't. You just had bad luck.
2008-04-30T23:44:00.000Z	soundray	Sherry345	can happen with any OS
2008-04-30T23:44:00.000Z	Sherry345	soundray	i have faced this problem 3 times and i did same, uninstalling uninstalling
2008-04-30T23:47:00.000Z	soundray	Sherry345	you should check the integrity of the CD. There is a boot option for that.
