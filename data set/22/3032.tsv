2009-02-13T04:02:00.000Z	wolter		how can i check two big text files for their differences?
2009-02-13T04:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolter	 the 'diff' command. is often used for that. there even color-varints of diff to make it more clear
2009-02-13T04:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolter	 now understanding the diff output.. thats a harder task. :)
2009-02-13T04:10:00.000Z	wolter	Dr_Willis	nah, its not that hard. The first file's lines are identified with a '<', while the second file's lines are identified with a '>'. The numbers above are just the line numbers, i think.
2009-05-23T23:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolter	 not normally needed these days..  but theres a factoid onit
2010-01-20T04:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolter	 permission issues most likely
2010-01-20T04:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolter	 check in #ubuntuone im not sure its possible
2010-10-10T11:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolter	 how could you even manage to do that?
2010-10-10T11:21:00.000Z	wolter	Dr_Willis	haha, i mean i moved it but I never saw the moved copy of it
2010-10-10T11:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolter	 if it truely got 'moved' to /dev/null then its been deleted
2010-10-10T11:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolter	 its possible its just lost somewhere... :) or has a name change..
2010-10-10T11:23:00.000Z	wolter	Dr_Willis	well  I don't think it could have been moved to /dev/null specifically, but I do not know how did I manage to copy it and then lose it on the next second without doing anything
2010-10-10T11:24:00.000Z	wolter	Dr_Willis	I was literally moving from folder to folder, there were two files. I performed a rename to one of them, and then I saw they were not present in the destination location
2010-10-10T11:27:00.000Z	wolter	Dr_Willis	i was willing to find an undeletion method http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rm_(Unix)
2010-10-10T11:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolter	 i guess you can try. You did check in your 'trash' ?
2010-10-10T11:27:00.000Z	wolter	Dr_Willis	so undeletion is possible on ubuntu?
2010-10-10T11:37:00.000Z	wolter	Dr_Willis	moved files are deleted with rm?
2010-10-10T11:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolter	 moving a file to /dev/null is the same as deleting them
2010-10-10T11:37:00.000Z	wolter	Dr_Willis	but a normal move through nautilus?
2010-10-10T11:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolter	 Im not even sure how you would move somthing to /dev/null in Nautilus.. or why you are even using the term /dev/null :) its a very specific thing..
2010-10-10T11:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolter	 so he somewhere got the term /dev/null in his head. :)
2010-10-10T11:42:00.000Z	wolter	Dr_Willis	lol, that was just a joke! I meant that I moved a file (through GUI, Jordan_U) and though there were no errors, it never reached its destination
