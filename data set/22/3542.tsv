2008-08-10T05:14:00.000Z	Knightbd		Anyone here able to help me find and mount an external hard drive that does NOT show under fdisk ?
2008-08-10T05:15:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	Run the program "tail -f /var/log/messages", plug the device in and turn it on, and then paste the new output somewhere.
2008-08-10T05:18:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	Do you know the filesystem on the device?  Is it just an external drive or a memory card reader?
2008-08-10T05:20:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	What /dev/sd* devices do you have?
2008-08-10T05:20:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	One of them should be your external drive, and the others your Linux partitions.
2008-08-10T05:22:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	You don't have a /dev/sdb?
2008-08-10T05:26:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	You start typing my name and hit tab to autocomplete with most programs
2008-08-10T05:27:00.000Z	Knightbd	goodbyegravity_	easy enough, but that's what shows up
2008-08-10T05:27:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	Do "ls /dev | grep sd" and see if you have anything other than /dev/sda
2008-08-10T05:27:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	If not, it sounds like it's not being installed as a block device, in which case I can't help any further.  :(
2008-08-10T05:29:00.000Z	Knightbd	goodbyegravity_	(comma=next line) ptysd,sda, sda1, sda2, sda3, sda4, ttysd
2008-08-10T05:30:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	That's weird, but I don't know anything about using dd.  :(  Sorry.
2008-08-10T05:30:00.000Z	Knightbd	goodbyegravity_	well, thanks for the help thus far, I know a little more than I did when I started.
2008-08-10T05:30:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	Let me plug in my external and see what kind of stuff it tells me.
2008-08-10T05:34:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	Your drive isn't being read correctly.  I'll paste all of the stuff that pops up for me
2008-08-10T05:36:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	http://paste.ubuntu.com/36052/
2008-08-10T05:37:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	Sorry, I think I pasted it twice there.
2008-08-10T05:38:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	It should be creating a /dev/sdb device.  You may want to try repartitioning it and reformatting it.
2008-08-10T05:38:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	Or find a way to make sure it isn't the external device or the adapter inside that's causing the problem.
2008-08-10T05:39:00.000Z	Knightbd	goodbyegravity_	I'm gonna try and put what I can into my buddies ftp server from my laptop (windows) it reads fine but oh...wait....theres some crazy encription on it right now..
2008-08-10T05:40:00.000Z	Knightbd	goodbyegravity_	 maybe if I remove the encryption, and format it as a basic NTFS filesystem
2008-08-10T05:40:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	Knightbd	Yeah, I think that's the problem.  You would have to mount the drive in a special manner to access it with encryption.
