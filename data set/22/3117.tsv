2009-06-23T00:02:00.000Z	FFMike		i'm running livecd to see how i like this before I install, and I'm  having difficulty connecting evolution to gmail
2009-06-23T00:02:00.000Z	FFMike		is this because I'm on livecd or is there an issue there I'm missing
2009-06-23T00:02:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	what seems to be the difficulty?
2009-06-23T00:03:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	what server?
2009-06-23T00:04:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	You need to enable POP or IMAP from gmail and use the appropriate settings in evolution
2009-06-23T00:05:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	Are you using POP or IMAP?

2009-06-23T00:22:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	yes
2009-06-23T00:23:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	10 GB is good to start with
2009-06-23T00:44:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	you need some help with partitioning buddy?
2009-06-23T00:45:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	Okay. Do you know much about linux file systems and mount points?
2009-06-23T00:46:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	In order to install Ubuntu, you need to parition your drive. Don't use Windows-based partitioning tools to create partitions on which you're going to install Ubuntu.
2009-06-23T00:47:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	Boot into Ubuntu from the Live CD and click on Install. Use the partitioning tool in the installer to do set up your partitions. :)
2009-06-23T00:48:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	okay, here's a very basic summary of the types of file systems. ntfs is windows-only. ext3 and ext4 are for linux. fat16/fat32 partitions can be easily accessed by both linux and windows. And you need a swap partition as well
2009-06-23T00:49:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	You can choose from the installer whether you want to it use your entire drive, or just install alongside Windows.
2009-06-23T00:50:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	Okay. Here's what you need to do.
2009-06-23T00:50:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	How much RAM do you have?
2009-06-23T00:51:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	Okay - so use that as the size for your swap partition.
2009-06-23T00:52:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	In linux, it's not enough to just create a partition and a file system - in order for it to be accessible by Ubuntu, you need to use mount points.
2009-06-23T00:52:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	Exactly. Now about mount points.
2009-06-23T02:00:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	If it works, then leave it alone.
2009-06-23T02:23:00.000Z	tiyowan	FFMike	They're all pretty good
