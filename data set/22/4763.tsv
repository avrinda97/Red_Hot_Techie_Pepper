2007-10-20T20:45:00.000Z	hendrixski		jo, you may want to reconfigure the xserver
2007-10-20T20:45:00.000Z	hendrixski		jo3, you may want to reconfigure the xserver
2007-10-20T20:45:00.000Z	Jo3	hendrixski	thanks, how would I do that?
2007-10-20T20:46:00.000Z	hendrixski	Jo3	there's probably an easier way, but you can do it from command line: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver(or whatever... just type in xser and then hit tab, it will autocomplete it)
2007-10-20T20:47:00.000Z	hendrixski	Jo3	that will redo your graphics setup ... if your resolution gets HUGE after that, just reboot
2007-10-20T20:47:00.000Z	Jo3	hendrixski	Package `xserver' is not installed and no info is available., is that the problem?
2007-10-20T20:48:00.000Z	hendrixski	Jo3	oh... then I mis-diagnosed the problem... I may not be able to help you after all.  sorry :-(
2007-10-20T20:48:00.000Z	Jo3	hendrixski	well thanks for trying
2007-10-20T20:48:00.000Z	hendrixski	Jo3	people help me on here all the time,  I'm trying to give back best I can :-)
2007-10-20T20:52:00.000Z	Jo3	hendrixski	I have xserver-xorg, so I put in  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and it ran
2007-10-20T20:52:00.000Z	hendrixski	Jo3	did that help the problem?  It's usually how I just fix everything dealing with my display setup
2007-10-20T20:55:00.000Z	Jo3	hendrixski	well, im running a pci express card , and it says pci 0:16:0, is that right?
2007-10-20T20:55:00.000Z	Jo3	hendrixski	pci express bus identifier pci 1:0:0 ?
2007-10-20T20:56:00.000Z	hendrixski	Jo3	I usually go with the defaults on there
2007-10-20T20:56:00.000Z	hendrixski	Jo3	I tried switching from what came up on the screen once and it didn't work out too well... just trust the tool
2007-10-20T21:01:00.000Z	Jo3	hendrixski	ok, after running through dpkg reconfigure, I ran aticonfig --resolution=0 again, this time it gave me Segmentation fault (core dumped)
2007-10-20T21:02:00.000Z	hendrixski	Jo3	oh no, that doesn't sound good.  umm, you may want to check launchpad if anybody else posted that bug... because that's not normal, and if they did, post your experience, maybe some log files and hopefully soon one of the developers will fix it
2007-10-20T21:02:00.000Z	hendrixski	Jo3	Like I said, there are a few ATI problems going around, and tons of people giving the developers their information helps the developers
2007-10-20T21:03:00.000Z	Jo3	hendrixski	k, thanks
2007-10-20T21:03:00.000Z	hendrixski	Jo3	wish I could help you b etter
2007-10-20T21:24:00.000Z	Jo3	hendrixski	does anyone know why when I enable ati 3d drivers I cant get my screen res over 800x600?
