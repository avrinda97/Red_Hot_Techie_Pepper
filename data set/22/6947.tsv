2006-10-03T05:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	|_ocke	What did you use to do the partition editing
2006-10-03T05:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	|_ocke	You didnt try to move/resize mounted partitions did you?  Can you run live to verify the partition letters/numbers are still the same?
2006-10-03T05:48:00.000Z	|_ocke	Jack_Sparrow	yes, im in live right now with it booted
2006-10-03T05:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	|_ocke	gparted still shows everything the same?
2006-10-03T05:48:00.000Z	|_ocke	Jack_Sparrow	yes
2006-10-03T05:50:00.000Z	|_ocke	Jack_Sparrow	i used partition magic and i think it did something weird
2006-10-03T05:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	|_ocke	Ouch..
2006-10-03T05:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	|_ocke	Version 7 is iffy at best, hope you were using 8 or above

2006-10-03T05:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	|_ocke	Not knowing what Partition MAgically Did for you I dont have any answers.
