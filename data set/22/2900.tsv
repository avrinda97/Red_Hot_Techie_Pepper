2009-05-12T20:06:00.000Z	danes		hello, how can I fix my distribution using a live cd? I tried to upgrade, but for some reasons i ended up messing the file system. Is it possible to restore it without reinstalling everrything?
2009-05-12T20:07:00.000Z	danes		the latest one
2009-05-12T20:07:00.000Z	ikonia	danes	and what' the problem with it
2009-05-12T20:06:00.000Z	ikonia	danes	what distro are you using ?
2009-05-12T20:08:00.000Z	ikonia	danes	what happens when you try to boot ?
2009-05-12T20:10:00.000Z	danes	ikonia	well, it starts loading some things, then it stalls in a sort of command prompt, but it is not because some commands like ls don't work. I tried to update the kernel from terminal, but I  did something wrong.
2009-05-12T20:10:00.000Z	danes	ikonia	I just want to know if it is possible to overwrite / without affecting /home/
2009-05-12T20:11:00.000Z	ikonia	danes	sure if /home is on a seperate partition
2009-05-12T20:11:00.000Z	danes	ikonia	unfortunately, it is not. My netbook already had 3 partitions, and the last one is used for ubuntu :(
2009-05-12T20:12:00.000Z	danes	ikonia	so I only have one partition for ubuntu
2009-05-12T20:12:00.000Z	ikonia	danes	not possible then, I suggest you copy off your /home directories
2009-05-12T20:13:00.000Z	danes	ikonia	I guess that's the only solution
2009-05-12T20:15:00.000Z	danes	ikonia	ok, I'm no expert, so I have to make questions. Do I really need to create a partition for swap? is it really necessary?
2009-05-12T20:17:00.000Z	danes	ikonia	the thing is that I have one partition for swap, one for the recovery filesystem (windows), other for windows, and the last one for ubuntu. I think I  am limited to have only 4 partitions onthe hdd, is that necessarily true?
2009-05-12T20:17:00.000Z	ikonia	danes	if you use extened partition you can hav 16 - but you won't be able to do that while you'v got 4 partitions, you'd need to delete one
2009-05-12T20:19:00.000Z	danes	ikonia	ok, so then I can use extended partitions to install several linux distributions? Is there any advantage on having primary vs extended partitions?
2009-05-12T20:19:00.000Z	ikonia	danes	not really
2009-05-12T20:21:00.000Z	danes	ikonia	I thought that I could only use primary partitions. Then, can I use extended partitions to install more linux distributions?
2009-05-12T20:21:00.000Z	ikonia	danes	sure
2009-05-12T20:23:00.000Z	danes	ikonia	thank you, just one last question, would you suggest leaving swap, recovery, and ntfs partitions as primary and formating the rest to other extended partitions, or can I include swap as extended?
2012-02-04T20:23:00.000Z	ikonia	danes	research linux compatible devices,
2012-02-04T20:24:00.000Z	ikonia	danes	also check at what kernel level they are supported at to make sure the ubuntu version you want to use is at that level
