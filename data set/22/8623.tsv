2005-07-08T08:02:00.000Z	Kyral		Anyone know how to clear the GNOME Session save?
2005-07-08T08:02:00.000Z	Kyral		Somehow I have like 3 instances of XChat starting up
2005-07-08T08:03:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyral	take a look at system-preferences-session, you may be able to find the extra invocations there
2005-07-08T08:13:00.000Z	Kyral	nickrud	that example doesn't include Backports
2005-07-08T08:13:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyral	yes, on purpose
2005-07-08T08:13:00.000Z	Kyral	nickrud	why?
2005-07-08T08:17:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyral	it's complex, and, maybe since I've last looked, solved, but fundamentally, backports do not mesh nicely with upgrading to breezy when it's released.
2005-07-08T08:18:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyral	I'm parroting some more competent people when I say that
2005-07-10T14:08:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyral	rcconf, sysvconfig and sysv-rc-conf, but they're all ncuurses, not really gui
2005-07-10T14:14:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyral	invoke-rc.d <thing> status, if it's implemented
2005-12-28T08:16:00.000Z	Kyral	nickrud	What retarded ISP blocks port 80?
2005-12-28T08:16:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyral	I had one, not any more
2005-12-29T07:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyral	they are still in the repos
2006-05-27T05:03:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyral	updating sources from a console, going to kde
2006-05-27T05:04:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyral	heh. Except his sources didn't see kubuntu-desktop :)
2006-05-29T05:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyral	you missed blackbox, what's wrong with you :)
2006-06-15T08:02:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyral	that's not suid, u+s is suid i think
2006-06-15T08:02:00.000Z	Kyral	nickrud	oh all I know is that Linux ignores the SUID and SGID bits on shell scripts
2006-06-15T08:03:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyral	I didn't know that, worth knowing ;)
2006-06-21T08:15:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyral	what book?
2006-06-21T08:15:00.000Z	nickrud	Kyral	ah, cross reading, nm
2006-06-21T08:15:00.000Z	Kyral	nickrud	O'Reilly's "MySQL In A Nutshell"
