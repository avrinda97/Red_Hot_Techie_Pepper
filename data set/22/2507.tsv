2009-11-14T00:02:00.000Z	Wiseman		I'm trying to compile something from source and I keep getting a make: "*** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop." error.  Wtf?
2009-11-14T00:03:00.000Z	Wiseman		I am
2009-11-14T00:03:00.000Z	Wiseman		according to the tutorial
2009-11-14T00:03:00.000Z	Wiseman		I did that Dr_Willis
2009-11-14T00:03:00.000Z	Wiseman		the instructions are very clear
2009-11-14T00:03:00.000Z	Wiseman		and I'm following them to a tee, but I get an error
2009-11-14T00:05:00.000Z	Wiseman		I'm trying to install qjoypad so I can use my joystick in a game, but I can't get this program to compile
2009-11-14T00:06:00.000Z	Wiseman		I unpack the tar.gz with tar -xzvf, cd into the new directory, do a ./config, and then make, make install.  but make gives me an error that no makefile is found
2009-11-14T00:08:00.000Z	Wiseman		 ./configure: No such file or directory
2009-11-14T00:08:00.000Z	Wiseman		doing ./config comes up with a few options, all of which are set correctly, and it says "type make then make install to install"
2009-11-14T00:08:00.000Z	llutz	Wiseman	no INSTALL or README?
2009-11-14T00:09:00.000Z	Wiseman		qjoypad-4.0.0
2009-11-14T00:09:00.000Z	Wiseman	llutz	yes, the install and readme all say to do exactly what I'm doin

2009-11-14T00:09:00.000Z	Wiseman		./config: line 66: qmake: command not found
2009-11-14T00:10:00.000Z	llutz		*surprise*
2009-11-14T00:10:00.000Z	Wiseman		does that mean I need to install qmake?
2009-11-14T00:10:00.000Z	Wiseman		couldn't find package qmake
