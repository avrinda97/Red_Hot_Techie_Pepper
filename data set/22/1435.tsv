2010-05-16T05:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mah2223_	Have you tried booting with an older kernel version?
2010-05-16T05:37:00.000Z	mah2223_	Jordan_U	yes i have tried every one in my grub menu to no avail, thank you though!
2010-05-16T05:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mah2223_	What repository did you get updates from? (I think the installer can install while keeping /home, even if it's not a separate partition, but I doubt that is necessary)
2010-05-16T05:40:00.000Z	mah2223_	Jordan_U	unfortunately i am not sure what the repository was and i think there actually may have been more than one
2010-05-16T05:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mah2223_	I'd say back up your /home but try to re-install without reformating the partition anyway. I think it will work.
2010-05-16T05:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mah2223_	Compiz settings are stored in /home
2010-05-16T05:45:00.000Z	mah2223_	Jordan_U	thank you. this re-install idea is what i originally had in mind but i am not sure how to do it!
2010-05-16T05:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mah2223_	Choose manual partitioning, select your current Ubuntu partition to be used as '/' and be sure to uncheck the box that says to reformat the partition
2010-05-16T05:48:00.000Z	mah2223_	Jordan_U	thank you very much you are a kind and noble gentlemen. I will attempt this straightaway.
2010-05-16T05:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mah2223_	You're welcome.
2010-05-16T06:07:00.000Z	mah2223_	Jordan_U	still around?? :-)
2010-05-16T06:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mah2223_	I'm back
2010-05-16T06:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mah2223_	What aren't you sure about exactly?
2010-05-16T06:30:00.000Z	mah2223_	Jordan_U	other kind men have been trying to help me follow your instructions but i don't know where to select '/' mount point
2010-05-16T06:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mah2223_	See this screenshot: http://silverwav.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/screenshot-prepare-partitions-firefox1.jpg
2010-05-16T06:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mah2223_	Where in that screenshot "Mountpoint" is set to "/backup2" you want it to be just "/"
2010-05-16T06:32:00.000Z	mah2223_	Jordan_U	thank you O sherpa of ubuntu
2010-05-16T06:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mah2223_	That may be caused by the same root problem that prevented you from booting.
2010-05-16T06:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mah2223_	Could you pastebin the output of "dmesg"?
2010-05-16T06:42:00.000Z	mah2223_	Jordan_U	certainly
2010-05-16T06:43:00.000Z	mah2223_	Jordan_U	can you just tell me how to get you that information?
2010-05-16T06:48:00.000Z	mah2223_	Jordan_U	i dont really know how to use IRC very well is there a way to do the colon thing to you and the other guy as well?
