2011-11-04T02:18:00.000Z	yoshi9099		Anyone have any experience with networking in ubuntu?
2011-11-04T02:19:00.000Z	rixter__	yoshi9099	yes, but you will need to be a little bit more specific.
2011-11-04T02:20:00.000Z	rixter__	yoshi9099	dhcp?
2011-11-04T02:20:00.000Z	yoshi9099	rixter__	yes
2011-11-04T02:22:00.000Z	rixter__	yoshi9099	have you seen if aa-logprof is complaining about something?
2011-11-04T02:24:00.000Z	yoshi9099	rixter__	how do I check that? I last booted a week ago.
2011-11-04T02:25:00.000Z	yoshi9099	rixter__	I've got it. only ntpd is in 'complain mode'. interesting, i've never used this apparmour thing, just browsed logs
2011-11-04T02:26:00.000Z	rixter__	yoshi9099	just a guess, but I'd bet if you reboot and type 'route' you'd be missing your gateway under default
2011-11-04T02:26:00.000Z	rixter__	yoshi9099	when you aren't working does 'ip a' show an ip address?
2011-11-04T02:27:00.000Z	yoshi9099	rixter__	ifconfig shows an ip address when it isnt' working
2011-11-04T02:27:00.000Z	rixter__	yoshi9099	can you ping locally?
2011-11-04T02:27:00.000Z	yoshi9099	rixter__	no
2011-11-04T02:28:00.000Z	rixter__	yoshi9099	are you pinging locally by ip or name?
2011-11-04T02:28:00.000Z	yoshi9099	rixter__	by name
2011-11-04T02:29:00.000Z	yoshi9099	rixter__	I don't know why I typed that, I meant by ip. I can't ping the gateway or any other host
2011-11-04T02:29:00.000Z	rixter__	yoshi9099	I had an issue like this once, but I was using static ip's and i had set it both inside of gnome desktop and /etc/network/interfaces
2011-11-04T02:30:00.000Z	rixter__	yoshi9099	I think it was a conflict between the WM and the networking service.
2011-11-04T02:31:00.000Z	yoshi9099	rixter__	I don't have a display hooked up to the box at present. What command can I run on CLI with an exported X display?
2011-11-04T02:45:00.000Z	rixter__	yoshi9099	"rixter__: I don't have a display hooked up to the box at present. What command can I run on CLI with an exported X display?" I honestly don't remember.
2011-11-04T02:46:00.000Z	yoshi9099	rixter__	I just opened up xfce4_panel and opened networking from in there, but there doesn't look like there is much in there.
2011-11-04T02:48:00.000Z	rixter__	yoshi9099	I honestly don't know why the network must be restarted before it starts up correctly.
2011-11-04T02:49:00.000Z	rixter__	yoshi9099	have you checked the system logs to see if its erroring on startup?
