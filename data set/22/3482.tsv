2009-07-15T12:39:00.000Z	neil		I'm sorry to go on about this but has anyone got any ideas on why the resolution isn't working. It's just that I am looking to move to a linux OS permanently but I want to try using it on my windows system first and I really can't use it properly if I only have a small window sized display
2009-07-15T12:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	what is the output of:   lspci | grep -i vga
2009-07-15T12:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	its a command line command, run i in terminal
2009-07-15T12:46:00.000Z	neil	ActionParsnip1	It says: 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: InnoTek Systemberatung GmbH VirtualBox Graphics Adapter
2009-07-15T12:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	ok, so its a virtualbox
2009-07-15T12:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	have youinstalled the guest additions?

2009-07-15T12:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	edit your xorg.conf and make the display sections similar
2009-07-15T12:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	actually i'd just use the whole thing
2009-07-15T12:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	your keyboard may be different (that example uses US layout, you can omit that line)
2009-07-15T12:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	you will need    gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf    to edit ti
2009-07-15T12:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	if you tab complete my name its easier, and it will highlight your text
2009-07-15T12:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	you will learn
2009-07-15T12:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	you need to get that text file as it is in the link i gave, then reboot. As long as you have the guest additions installed correctly then it will be fine
2009-07-15T12:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	you needed to execute the .run file on the guest additions CD for your architecture
2009-07-15T12:57:00.000Z	neil	ActionParsnip1	I did the run for the additions and I have got the text file and I'm just gonna reboot see if that sorts it. Thank you and I will be back to et you know if I am up and running or not
2009-07-15T13:03:00.000Z	neil	ActionParsnip1	Nope, still no joy. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit crap because I feel like I'm bugging people, I feel like I should know the basics before I start asking for help but I can't start learning the basic until I can actually use my full screen.
2009-07-15T13:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	its all learning dude, dont sweat it
2009-07-15T13:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	maybe someone in #vbox can help
2009-07-15T13:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	as you use the OS you will get better at it
2009-07-15T13:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	just like i'm sure you are with microsoft products
2009-07-15T13:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	neil	as is ask.com  msn.com  yahoo.com
