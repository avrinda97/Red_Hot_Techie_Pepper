2007-05-22T06:12:00.000Z	foso		ok, sorry, i missed whats going on i guess
2007-05-22T06:13:00.000Z	foso		awesome
2007-05-22T06:15:00.000Z	foso		ok
2007-05-22T06:15:00.000Z	foso		one more question, does it display your name when i click on your name first?
2007-05-22T06:17:00.000Z	rococo	foso	run "glxinfo|grep rendering" in a terminal and see it's enabled
2007-05-22T06:19:00.000Z	rococo	foso	I think that's your problem
2007-05-22T06:20:00.000Z	foso	rococo	that will make it check all the repositories?
2007-05-22T06:22:00.000Z	rococo	foso	huh?
2007-05-22T06:22:00.000Z	foso	rococo	you told me to run a command that would fix my problem, what problem? sorry
2007-05-22T06:23:00.000Z	rococo	foso	oh, sorry. that command was to check if you had that problem. the problem is that your card driver isn't working quite right with your card, or all the options aren't enabled. I'll get to helping you fix it in a sec - sorry, I answered too many people in here at once ;-)
2007-05-22T06:24:00.000Z	foso	rococo	im confused, i think im good thanks!
2007-05-22T06:25:00.000Z	foso	rococo	my card is working fine
2007-05-22T06:25:00.000Z	rococo	foso	well, the direct rendering part of it isn't if it said "no." having direct rendering working will make everything work much, much better in fullscreen
2007-05-22T06:26:00.000Z	foso	rococo	ok thanks, ill hang on until you have time to tell me how to enable it
2007-05-22T06:26:00.000Z	rococo	foso	that guide I linked you to has an awesome place to start
2007-05-22T06:26:00.000Z	foso	rococo	thanks ill check it!
