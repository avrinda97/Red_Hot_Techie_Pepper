2012-10-12T03:05:00.000Z	VanZan		I used YUMI to install Ubunut 12.04 to a USB key. Is there any way I can download files to the same USB key please? Thank you!
2012-10-12T03:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	VanZan	 it should be formated to fat32 normally. you can still use any space on it to save things. unless the installer made a persistant home/save file. then it should let you save to it also under the ubuntu os.
2012-10-12T03:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	VanZan	 mounted how exactly? can root write to it?
2012-10-12T03:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	VanZan	 use sudo to see if root can write to it....
2012-10-12T03:08:00.000Z	VanZan	dr_willis	what is the command i should use please?
2012-10-12T03:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	VanZan	 perhaps 'sudo touch /whatever/the/path/is/to/the/usb/testfile'
2012-10-12T03:10:00.000Z	VanZan	dr_willis	did that mate and nothing happened?
2012-10-12T03:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	VanZan	 look on the flash and see if the file is there..
2012-10-12T03:11:00.000Z	VanZan	dr_willis	It's not there!
2012-10-12T03:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	VanZan	 what was the exact command you used?
2012-10-12T03:11:00.000Z	VanZan	dr_willis	sudo touch /cdrom/download
2012-10-12T03:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	VanZan	 its very possible that /cdrom/ is mounted read only. the mount command may show you.
2012-10-12T03:12:00.000Z	VanZan	dr_willis	Can you tell me the full mount command please? I'm sorry I'm a complete Linux noob!
2012-10-12T03:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	VanZan	 just 'mount' shows whats mounted where
2012-10-12T03:14:00.000Z	VanZan	dr_willis	/dev/sdb1 on /cdrom type vfat (rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=cp437,iocharset=iso8859-1,shortname=mixed,errors=remount-ro)
2012-10-12T03:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	VanZan	 so do a 'cd /cdrom' and see what files are therel. see if you can make a file. it seems to be mounted RW.
2012-10-12T03:15:00.000Z	VanZan	dr_willis	it says "permission denied"
2012-10-12T03:18:00.000Z	VanZan	dr_willis	Don't give up on me mate!!! :)
2012-10-12T03:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	VanZan	 remount it with the correct options would be my suggestion.
2012-10-12T03:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	VanZan	 you did try makign the file as root? or a user?
2012-10-12T03:18:00.000Z	VanZan	dr_willis	as a user
2012-10-12T03:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	VanZan	 so try as root with sudo again...
