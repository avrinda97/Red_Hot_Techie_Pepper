2007-05-18T08:11:00.000Z	Toma-	tri3axe	nvclock can control fan speed, not sure it the 8xxx series up supported yet
2007-05-18T08:12:00.000Z	Toma-	tri3axe	its in the repositories, but you might need to get the 0.8beta2 version from their website
2007-05-18T08:23:00.000Z	Toma-	tri3axe	run 'nvclock_gtk'
2007-05-18T08:24:00.000Z	Toma-	tri3axe	dont expect great things.
2007-05-18T08:25:00.000Z	Toma-	tri3axe	never said there was :D read the man pages on nvclock
2007-05-18T08:29:00.000Z	Toma-	tri3axe	are you certain its running that hot?

2007-05-18T08:41:00.000Z	Toma-	tri3axe	id say (and this might or might not work) get the /src/nclock.c file and swap it with the 0.8beta2 you have
