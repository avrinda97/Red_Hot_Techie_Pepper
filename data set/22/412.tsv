2011-10-18T06:16:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	rjyoung	Have you tried rebooting?

2011-10-18T06:18:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	rjyoung	Try switching themes. Did you do anything with Emerald?
2011-10-18T06:19:00.000Z	rjyoung	KatsumeBlisk	 nope just the little button on the left hand side of window
2011-10-18T06:19:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	rjyoung	So just the 'X', '-', and maximize? Mind sending me a screenshot?

2011-10-18T06:20:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	rjyoung	Upload it somewhere like imgur or tinypic and give me a link to it.

2011-10-18T06:28:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	rjyoung	Move your mouse to the top left. You're just maximized. ;)
2011-10-18T06:28:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	rjyoung	As far as I can tell, anyway.
2011-10-18T06:28:00.000Z	rjyoung	KatsumeBlisk	 look where it says status
2011-10-18T06:29:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	rjyoung	oh. XD HOld on.
2011-10-18T06:30:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	rjyoung	I'm not sure. Sorry. My only guess was the reboot to restart compiz.
2011-10-18T06:31:00.000Z	rjyoung	KatsumeBlisk	is there a way to reset compiz
2011-10-18T06:31:00.000Z	rjyoung	KatsumeBlisk	settings
2011-10-18T06:34:00.000Z	rjyoung	KatsumeBlisk	was going to search though forums but dunno what to look for
2011-10-18T06:34:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	rjyoung	No that I know of. There's a command. It might be "compiz --restart" I think.
2011-10-18T06:35:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	rjyoung	I don't have compiz, so I'm not sure.
