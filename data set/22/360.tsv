2011-11-19T01:48:00.000Z	bekks	TK5791	please behave and use words without *, so others actually understand what you mean.
2011-11-19T01:50:00.000Z	bekks	TK5791	No. I just want to understand whats your problem with what exactly. Just describe it in detail, then someone can help you maybe.
2011-11-19T01:51:00.000Z	bekks	TK5791	You have to have an active password, and then you can turn the authentication off.
2011-11-19T01:52:00.000Z	bekks	TK5791	You cannot login without an deactivated password ;)
2011-11-19T01:53:00.000Z	bekks	TK5791	How do you know you have a deactivated password?
2011-11-19T01:54:00.000Z	bekks	TK5791	"login to the user accounts" means what exactly?
2011-11-19T01:55:00.000Z	bekks	TK5791	And a not shown password doesnt mean it is a) deactivated or b) not set. It isnt shown. It cannot be shown since all that is stored is the hash of the password.
2011-11-19T01:56:00.000Z	bekks	TK5791	Read what I wrote seconds ago.
2011-11-19T01:57:00.000Z	bekks	TK5791	Then enable autologin.
2011-11-19T01:57:00.000Z	bekks	TK5791	Autologin is just enabled.
2011-11-19T01:59:00.000Z	bekks	TK5791	"doesnt work" means "I forgot the new one".
2011-11-19T13:17:00.000Z	bekks	TK5791	Ask your real question.
2011-11-19T13:19:00.000Z	bekks	TK5791	Use your webbrowser.
2011-11-19T13:19:00.000Z	bekks	TK5791	Go to their website, login to your notes, done.
2011-11-19T13:19:00.000Z	TK5791	bekks	didn't know they did a web browser version
2011-11-19T13:20:00.000Z	bekks	TK5791	That is their key feature...
2011-11-19T13:21:00.000Z	TK5791	bekks	I'll have a look at their web feature
2011-11-19T13:21:00.000Z	TK5791	bekks	thank you
