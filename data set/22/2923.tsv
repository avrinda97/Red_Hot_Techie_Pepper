2009-05-13T20:28:00.000Z	kixx		There has been a resource intensive process running on my laptop  (Jaunty) for the last 3 hours.  Any ideas what this might be, or what logs I can check to find out?
2009-05-13T20:28:00.000Z	sipior	kixx	"top" would generally show the culprit process.
2009-05-13T20:31:00.000Z	kixx	sipior	thanks, it looks like w3m
2009-05-13T20:32:00.000Z	sipior	kixx	it's a text-based web browser
2009-05-13T20:34:00.000Z	kixx	sipior	VCoolio: thanks.  That can'be be eating all my resources... I'll keep checking.
2009-05-13T20:34:00.000Z	sipior	kixx	which resources? memory? cpu cycles? hard disk space?
2009-05-13T20:36:00.000Z	kixx	sipior	memory, cpu cycles, constant disk read/write.  it has slowed the responsiveness of the system to useless... almost like an indexing cron job or something.
2009-05-13T20:37:00.000Z	sipior	kixx	how long has it been a problem?
2009-05-13T20:39:00.000Z	kixx	sipior	Today, for the first time.  It's been going to three hours.
2009-05-13T20:40:00.000Z	kixx	sipior	I want to track it down before I shut the machine down.
2009-05-13T20:41:00.000Z	sipior	kixx	when you run top, which processes are hanging out at the top of the cpu usage list?
2009-05-13T20:41:00.000Z	sipior	kixx	(besides top)
2009-05-13T20:43:00.000Z	kixx	sipior	multiload-apple, chipcardd4, Xorg, w3m, gnome-terminal, kswapd0
2009-05-13T20:44:00.000Z	sipior	kixx	if you kill w3m, do things improve?
2009-05-13T20:46:00.000Z	kixx	sipior	Yeah, w3m was the culprit.  Any idea why?
2009-05-13T20:46:00.000Z	sipior	kixx	depends on what pages it was viewing.
2009-05-13T20:47:00.000Z	kixx	sipior	I never use it, is there a cron job that uses it?
2009-05-13T20:47:00.000Z	sipior	kixx	not to my recollection
2009-05-13T20:48:00.000Z	kixx	sipior	Thanks.  Mmmm... makes me wonder what just happened to my laptop?
2009-05-13T20:49:00.000Z	sipior	kixx	probably nothing untoward. if it happens again, look to see how long the process has been running, and the username of the owner.
2009-05-13T20:50:00.000Z	kixx	sipior	OK, Thanks again for the timely help :-)
2009-05-13T20:51:00.000Z	sipior	kixx	no trouble
