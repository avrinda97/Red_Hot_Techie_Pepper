2010-10-24T11:04:00.000Z	Diamondcite	MissingPerson	Do these subs work when NOT hard coded?
2010-10-24T11:05:00.000Z	MissingPerson	Diamondcite	Not in VLC, but I have confirmed them to work on another system
2010-10-24T11:05:00.000Z	Diamondcite	MissingPerson	How about in mplayer ?
2010-10-24T11:06:00.000Z	Diamondcite	MissingPerson	There is a chance you might need to make the subs UTF-8 before they'll work right.
2010-10-24T11:08:00.000Z	Diamondcite	MissingPerson	name your subs the same name as the video but keep the extesion as .smi and play the file using the mplayer command line
2010-10-24T11:09:00.000Z	MissingPerson	Diamondcite	doesn't work, how can i change them to UTF-8?
2010-10-24T11:10:00.000Z	Diamondcite	MissingPerson	I don't know a proper way.. but the improper way.. open it up in a text editor which CAN see it properly.
2010-10-24T11:13:00.000Z	MissingPerson	Diamondcite	Every text editor loads up gibberish
2010-10-24T11:14:00.000Z	Diamondcite	MissingPerson	Is this linux korean capable?
2010-10-24T11:14:00.000Z	Diamondcite	MissingPerson	How about renaiming it from .smi to .txt and try to open it in firefox?
2010-10-24T11:15:00.000Z	MissingPerson	Diamondcite	same problem
2010-10-24T11:16:00.000Z	Diamondcite	MissingPerson	Will you mind going through some troubles to get this to work? (quite a bit might need to be installed too)
2010-10-24T11:20:00.000Z	MissingPerson	Diamondcite	Tried using a different sub file for the same movie, same language, same problem.
2010-10-24T11:21:00.000Z	Diamondcite	MissingPerson	Do you know the original character encoding of the file?
2010-10-24T11:21:00.000Z	Diamondcite	MissingPerson	Actually can you send me the subs alone? I need to experiment a little.
2010-10-24T11:22:00.000Z	MissingPerson	Diamondcite	can't tell you
2010-10-24T11:25:00.000Z	Diamondcite	MissingPerson	I see... well then good luck figuring out the encoding "iconv -f <whatever the korean encoding is> -t utf8 [filename] > [newfilename]"
