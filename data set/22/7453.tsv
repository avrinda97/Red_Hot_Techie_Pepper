2006-09-20T12:37:00.000Z	fredl		shoot, network-manager won't detect my ipw2200 wireless card.
2006-09-20T12:37:00.000Z	fredl		What's up with that network-manager, it won't recognize two of the most common wireless cards, the Intel Pro and the Aironet.
2006-09-20T12:37:00.000Z	fredl		another typical Redhat product :(
2006-09-20T12:37:00.000Z	POVaddct	fredl	does iwconfig see it?
2006-09-20T12:38:00.000Z	fredl	POVaddct	yeah, it even comes up fine because it's configured in the network-config
2006-09-20T12:38:00.000Z	fredl	POVaddct	when I nm-tool though, it says no recognized interfaces
2006-09-20T12:38:00.000Z	POVaddct	fredl	btw, aironet is not very common nowadays
2006-09-20T12:38:00.000Z	fredl	POVaddct	come on, support for it has been in the kernel forever.
2006-09-20T12:39:00.000Z	fredl	POVaddct	that's one of the reasons I bought it.
2006-09-20T12:39:00.000Z	POVaddct	fredl	yeah, but that minipci card is only built in rather old notebooks
2006-09-20T12:39:00.000Z	fredl	POVaddct	not the minipci card, I got a PCMCIA card.
2006-09-20T12:39:00.000Z	POVaddct	fredl	oh, okay
2006-09-20T12:40:00.000Z	fredl	POVaddct	I even bought myself an old AP340 access point :)
2006-09-20T12:40:00.000Z	POVaddct	fredl	i'd prefer something which is supported by the madwifi driver. you can build APs with it :)
2006-09-20T12:41:00.000Z	fredl	POVaddct	just coz they're so cool and have a clue about 802.1x accounting.
2006-09-20T12:41:00.000Z	fredl	POVaddct	argh, AP on your wireless card?? *yikes* I know organisations that punish people for doing so. Doesn't that put the card in ad-hoc mode?
2006-09-20T12:41:00.000Z	POVaddct	fredl	not ad-hoc, but master mode
2006-09-20T12:42:00.000Z	fredl	POVaddct	ok now that's interesting.
2006-09-20T12:42:00.000Z	POVaddct	fredl	sometimes when i travel by train, i bullshit other people by running a fake hotspot
2006-09-20T12:43:00.000Z	fredl	POVaddct	LOL.
2006-09-20T12:44:00.000Z	fredl	POVaddct	here in .nl we call that Jip & Janneke language :P
2006-09-20T12:45:00.000Z	POVaddct	fredl	hehe
