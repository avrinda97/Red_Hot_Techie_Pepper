2008-07-24T13:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	does it run with gksudo (just to test)
2008-07-24T13:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	just type gksudo before the application you normally run
2008-07-24T13:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	you can also autocomplete names in irc ;)
2008-07-24T13:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	I put your name at the start so you know im addressing you
2008-07-24T13:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	right click the item -> properties
2008-07-24T13:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	try tab completing the command
2008-07-24T13:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	type half a command and press tab
2008-07-24T13:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	no, that only gives you the command you need to run from command line to run the same app
2008-07-24T13:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	ok, the menu thing you have essentially gives you a pretty thing to click to run your apps
2008-07-24T13:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	you can do exactly the same thing from command line, you can do everything at cli that you can do in gui
2008-07-24T13:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	if you want to launch an app with admin privs you'll need gksudo
2008-07-24T13:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	so you find out the program to run then type it out but put gksudo at the start
2008-07-24T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	ok any output?
2008-07-24T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	you need that library
2008-07-24T13:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	try sudo apt-get install libglitz
2008-07-24T13:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	try tab completing it :D
2008-07-24T13:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	I might have some gold for you
2008-07-24T13:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	seems you arent alone: http://fixunix.com/ubuntu/512311-anyone-get-cairo-dock-work-hardy.html
2008-07-24T13:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XazzzaX	but.
