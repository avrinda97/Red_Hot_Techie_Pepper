2006-03-27T11:58:00.000Z	rainbowjoshua		Anyone here gotten Ubuntu installed on a SATA drive?
2006-03-27T11:59:00.000Z	react-	rainbowjoshua	yes
2006-03-27T12:00:00.000Z	rainbowjoshua	react-	I'm having a hard time with it.  I was trying to get it to join my IDE (which has a rather defuct failed Dapper on it, but important data), and now I've got that drive disconnected, just trying to get Breezy into the SATA alone.
2006-03-27T12:00:00.000Z	rainbowjoshua		No matter how I install, the install finishes, and I get NON SYSTEM DISK ERROR.
2006-03-27T12:04:00.000Z	react-	rainbowjoshua	are you sure you have your bios set to boot off the correct HD?
2006-03-27T12:06:00.000Z	rainbowjoshua	react-	Well, the BIOS has very few options for the SATA.  It just assigns the SATA to the IDE interface, it seems.  The only other options are to disable it or to assign it to RAID.
2006-03-27T12:07:00.000Z	react-	rainbowjoshua	there should be a option in your bios to set the boot option, ie 1st floppy 2nd cdrom 3rd some-harddisk,
2006-03-27T12:08:00.000Z	react-	rainbowjoshua	make sure you have the SATA disk before any other harddrives
2006-03-27T12:08:00.000Z	rainbowjoshua	react-	There is, but SATA isn't in there, only IDE hard drive, CDROM, floppy, etc.
2006-03-27T12:08:00.000Z	react-	rainbowjoshua	what motherboard do you have?
2006-03-27T12:09:00.000Z	rainbowjoshua	react-	ATI RS480M2  You just gave me the idea, and I'm checking for BIOS updates.
2006-03-27T12:26:00.000Z	rainbowjoshua	react-	I think there is a new version of my BIOS.  I hope it's that simple. The error I'm getting now is GRUB Loading stage1.5 and then Error 2
2006-03-27T12:26:00.000Z	react-	rainbowjoshua	did you change anything to get that new grub error?
2006-03-27T12:27:00.000Z	rainbowjoshua	react-	Well, I installed like 5 times last night, with different partition situations.  Most of them didn't get to grub, this one does.
2006-03-27T12:27:00.000Z	rainbowjoshua	react-	I know I've got a small /boot partition
2006-03-27T12:28:00.000Z	react-	rainbowjoshua	is your /boot just ext3?
2006-03-27T12:28:00.000Z	rainbowjoshua	react-	The installer says so.
2006-03-27T12:29:00.000Z	react-	rainbowjoshua	if it's trying to load grub then i don't think upgrading your bios will help
2006-03-27T12:29:00.000Z	react-		have you googled that grub error?
2006-03-27T12:30:00.000Z	rainbowjoshua	react-	I'm booting to the CD.  I want to try to get to the /boot partition and see the grub config stuff... I'm not totally sure how.
2006-03-27T12:30:00.000Z	rainbowjoshua		How do I get into recovery mode from the install CD?
2006-03-27T12:31:00.000Z	react-	rainbowjoshua	can't tell you off the top of my head, check the ubuntu website
