2011-11-15T21:03:00.000Z	mengesb	ikonia	i'm still awaiting a bit of help myself here
2011-11-15T21:03:00.000Z	mengesb	ikonia	don't know why .profile is not getting sourced
2011-11-15T21:04:00.000Z	ikonia	mengesb	that's fine, but you don't need to use this channel for that username conversation
2011-11-15T21:04:00.000Z	ikonia	mengesb	I've just told you 2 reasons
2011-11-15T21:05:00.000Z	mengesb	ikonia	two reasons for my issue? where?
2011-11-15T21:05:00.000Z	ikonia	mengesb	ahhh, I said it to malaphus instead of you, sorry
2011-11-15T21:05:00.000Z	ikonia	mengesb	scroll up a few lines if you can
2011-11-15T21:07:00.000Z	ikonia	mengesb	.profile is not for bash by default, ubuntu put a hack in the .bashrc file to source it
2011-11-15T21:08:00.000Z	ikonia	mengesb	.profile is for bourne/korn shell, .bashprofile and .bashrc are for bash
2011-11-15T21:08:00.000Z	mengesb	ikonia	so instead i should use .bash_profile?
2011-11-15T21:08:00.000Z	ikonia	mengesb	yes, but again, it's for login shells
2011-11-15T21:09:00.000Z	mengesb	ikonia	ok, so then what's the difference between gnome-terminal and a login shell?
2011-11-15T21:10:00.000Z	mengesb	ikonia	cause it apparently didn't matter in 10.04LTS
2011-11-15T21:10:00.000Z	ikonia	mengesb	yes, and I've just told you where to look for potential changes
2011-11-15T21:11:00.000Z	mengesb	ikonia	with bash -l it is
2011-11-15T21:11:00.000Z	ikonia	mengesb	ok, so the issue is gnome-terminal is not a login shell by default
2011-11-15T21:12:00.000Z	mengesb	ikonia	well there's no man entry for gnome-terminal
2011-11-15T21:16:00.000Z	mengesb	ikonia	... i have to manually dictate 'run command as login shell' ... what the...
2011-11-15T21:17:00.000Z	ikonia	mengesb	have you read the documentation ?
2011-11-15T21:17:00.000Z	mengesb	ikonia	found a random post on lq
2011-11-15T21:17:00.000Z	mengesb	ikonia	stupid changes to gnome-terminal ... ugh
2011-11-15T21:17:00.000Z	mengesb	ikonia	no, it was correct
