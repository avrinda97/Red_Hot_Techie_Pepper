2010-03-12T07:43:00.000Z	Losha	Slyboots	either your install CD is faulty, or your raid is faulty. Pray it's the former. Did it pass the self test?
2010-03-12T07:44:00.000Z	Losha	Slyboots	bad news. You need expert raid help. Beyond me, I'm afraid...
2010-03-12T07:47:00.000Z	Losha	Slyboots	luckily you've lost no data if you've just made the array. Try a more stable distro e.g. 8.04?
2010-03-12T07:49:00.000Z	Losha	Slyboots	sorry, but I wouldn't run 9.10 on a mission critical server. It's just not mature enough...
2010-03-12T07:55:00.000Z	Losha	Slyboots	I don't know of an OS where that's *guaranteed* not to happen. Even w*dows users have install problems...
2010-03-12T07:57:00.000Z	Losha	Slyboots	less chance of that happening with 8.04, but no guarantees. You could always ask for your money back...
2010-03-12T07:57:00.000Z	Losha	Slyboots	understood...
2010-03-12T08:00:00.000Z	Losha	Slyboots	the point about 8.04, which is a long term support release, is that it's all bugfixes and no new features. It's your best bet for stability. But no guarantees, sorry...
2010-03-12T08:01:00.000Z	Losha	Slyboots	start an 8.04 download before you go...
2010-03-12T08:05:00.000Z	Losha	Slyboots	sorry. What are you gonna do next?
2010-03-12T08:06:00.000Z	Losha	Slyboots	try a different distro?
2010-03-12T08:07:00.000Z	Losha	Slyboots	cheers...
