2009-12-26T20:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	considering how uncommon that problem is, it will likely take a while for any of us to find a possible solution
2009-12-26T20:36:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	it appears to reference something about gconf
2009-12-26T20:37:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	you might need to remove or rename your ~/.gconf temporarily
2009-12-26T20:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	#ubuntu on chat.freenode.net
2009-12-26T20:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	~/.gconf
2009-12-26T20:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	~/ is automatically expanded to equal /home/USERNAME/
2009-12-26T20:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	just /home/username
2009-12-26T21:13:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	you're welcome
2009-12-26T21:13:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	btw, I think your ! key might be feeling a bit sore
2009-12-26T21:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	or nautilus & disown
2009-12-26T21:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	don't do that as root
2009-12-26T21:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	what are you trying to do in response to that?
2009-12-26T21:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	don't do it from the system monitor
2009-12-26T21:32:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	use ps ax | grep nautilus, find the PID of nautilus run by root, then use sudo kill PID
2009-12-26T21:32:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	replace ax with aux
2009-12-26T21:32:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	the PID is the number after the username
2009-12-26T21:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	it should regardless of the kernel version
2009-12-26T21:44:00.000Z	lstarnes	Rob215	the versions in the update manager are slightly different than what the linux kernel's developers make
