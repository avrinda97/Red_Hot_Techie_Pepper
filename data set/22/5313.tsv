2007-11-26T03:55:00.000Z	jonaskoelker		question: I have two ogg files, song.ogg and guitar.ogg, that I want to mix together to one ogg files containing them both played simultaneously; how can I do this?
2007-11-26T03:55:00.000Z	Slart	jonaskoelker	try audacity

2009-02-02T21:38:00.000Z	Slart	jonaskoelker	yes.. the very same.. coming up with original nicks for irc is hard..
2009-02-24T02:30:00.000Z	Slart	jonaskoelker	I think flash uses what firefox uses.. and that can be set using a setting in "about:config"
2009-02-24T02:31:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Slart	what's the pref name?
2009-02-24T02:31:00.000Z	Slart	jonaskoelker	I'm looking.. I configured it myself only a month or so ago.. but I've already forgotten what it was called =)
2009-02-24T02:34:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Slart	wouldn't it make sense that firefox doesn't know about sound natively, but lets plugins handle that?
2009-02-24T02:34:00.000Z	Slart	jonaskoelker	ah.. it was in /etc/firefox-3.0/firefoxrc .. there is a keyword FIREFOX_DSP=
2009-02-24T02:35:00.000Z	Slart	jonaskoelker	I think you can set it to padsp or aoss to use pulseaudio or alsa respectively
2009-02-24T02:35:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Slart	/etc/firefox-3.0/firefoxrc doesn't exist on my box... hmm...
2009-02-24T02:36:00.000Z	Slart	jonaskoelker	nothing firefox at all in /etc for you?
2009-02-24T02:37:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Slart	/etc/firefox-3.0/pr{ef,ofile} alright, but locate firefoxrc is empty
2009-02-24T02:37:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Slart	so how do you make firefox use something else?
2009-02-24T02:38:00.000Z	Slart	jonaskoelker	hmm.. I've got the pref and profile folders too.. but also this firefoxrc... hang on.. let me pastebin it for you

2009-02-24T02:48:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Slart	doesn't work :(
2009-02-24T02:48:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Slart	no value of FIREFOX_DSP seems to work for me
2009-05-08T02:41:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Slart	and remove the livecd and put in the blank how?  ...
2009-05-08T02:41:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Slart	has this been solved for jaunty?
2009-05-08T02:41:00.000Z	Slart	jonaskoelker	does it really need the cd once it has created the ram drive?
