2011-03-02T11:07:00.000Z	Ep1kMalware		did it return an error?
2011-03-02T11:07:00.000Z	Ep1kMalware		ah
2011-03-02T11:08:00.000Z	Ep1kMalware		sda/sdb are your only annoucned devices..
2011-03-02T11:08:00.000Z	Ep1kMalware		1 sec
2011-03-02T11:09:00.000Z	Ep1kMalware		it's been a while since I've worked with fstab, while back I had a gnarly external drive..
2011-03-02T11:09:00.000Z	Ep1kMalware		let me read the man page
2011-03-02T11:09:00.000Z	Ep1kMalware		meanwhile, let's create a temporary mount folder
2011-03-02T11:09:00.000Z	Ep1kMalware		do sudo cd /mnt || mkdir /mnt
2011-03-02T11:10:00.000Z	Ep1kMalware		but we're having trouble figuring out what the system is calling it, if at all.
2011-03-02T11:11:00.000Z	Ep1kMalware		I couldn't remember if linux has a /mnt folder or not.
2011-03-02T11:13:00.000Z	Starminn	Ep1kMalware	It does have a /mnt folder, but it seems to use /media as its default mount point stuff.
2011-03-02T11:13:00.000Z	Ep1kMalware	Starminn	right on.
2011-03-02T11:14:00.000Z	Ep1kMalware	Starminn	I like /mnt for testing device mounts :)
2011-03-02T11:14:00.000Z	Starminn	Ep1kMalware	Yeah, I was going to say that if I had to guess for a reason it even has /mnt to begin with is because it's what people are used to. *shrug*
2011-03-02T11:21:00.000Z	Starminn	Ep1kMalware	If you would please, listen to ubottu. ;)
2011-03-02T11:21:00.000Z	Ep1kMalware	Starminn	I'm right about to /ignore it actually
2011-03-02T11:22:00.000Z	Starminn	Ep1kMalware	I would advise against that. I would say it would be easier to simply type "fal [TAB]" "message in a cohesive, readable sentence" than to fight me on this one.
2011-03-02T11:22:00.000Z	Starminn	Ep1kMalware	Please and thank you
2011-03-02T11:23:00.000Z	Ep1kMalware	Starminn	I'd rather not have a bot highlight me multiple times for a stupid typo.
2011-03-02T12:03:00.000Z	Starminn	Ep1kMalware	kurtis fallguy: Try some of those
2011-03-02T12:08:00.000Z	Starminn	Ep1kMalware	So use on of the ones from !find
2011-03-02T12:08:00.000Z	Ep1kMalware	Starminn	I don't use ubuntu lol
