2010-01-26T19:28:00.000Z	g0		Hi, I'm to ping my lan computer from wan ip address... I've disabled ufw, iptables, and my router is forwarding the port. Is there anything else I should be aware of? <- ubuntu 9.04
2010-01-26T19:29:00.000Z	Jon123	g0	ping from both directions and then you will know
2010-01-26T19:30:00.000Z	g0	Jon123	I'm confused, I can ping the wan address from the lan
2010-01-26T19:31:00.000Z	Jon123	g0	on so you just want to see if your ubuntu box can be seen from the internet?
2010-01-26T19:31:00.000Z	g0	Jon123	Yes, I want to make it so, because I want to configure a webserver
2010-01-26T19:33:00.000Z	Jon123	g0	keep in mind some isp will filter incoming ports on your connection.  Google for a portscan on your connection.
2010-01-26T19:33:00.000Z	Jon123	g0	ping from the subnet will tell you nothing about what the wider net sees
2010-01-26T19:33:00.000Z	g0	Jon123	Good point, ill check that
2010-01-26T19:46:00.000Z	g0	Jon123	I think your right, I used this port scanner to scan 1-400 and even though it reveals services, all ports are closed :/
2010-01-26T19:47:00.000Z	Jon123	g0	how is your isp?
2010-01-26T19:48:00.000Z	g0	Jon123	My isp is at&t
2010-01-26T19:48:00.000Z	g0	Jon123	U-verse
2010-01-26T19:49:00.000Z	Jon123	g0	oh, I know verizon locks down port 80, you can reconfig the server if you really want or just run the server on the subnet and get a host when you want to put it out there
2010-01-26T19:50:00.000Z	g0	Jon123	Ya, I'm trying to find an open port now, that I can just map to my router or something
2010-01-26T19:51:00.000Z	Jon123	g0	reconfig apache to use a different port, thin you need to do it the other way, port forward an open port to 80 on the server ip
2010-01-26T19:58:00.000Z	g0	Jon123	I'm not sure if its the isp... I put DMZ mode on, and I'm using a port scanner from the internet, all the ports are still closed?
2010-01-26T19:59:00.000Z	g0	Jon123	They wouldn't block every port under 400 would they?
2010-01-26T19:59:00.000Z	Jon123	g0	just cause it is in the DMZ does not mean it is out there if the ISP is port blocking
2010-01-26T20:00:00.000Z	Jon123	g0	try different ports like ftp, smtp, ssh, those should be open
2010-01-26T20:12:00.000Z	g0	Jon123	Their is a port 6881 that is open through the router. When I do port scan on 6881 I get no response, so it could be router... is there any way to find the source of this problem?
2010-01-26T20:14:00.000Z	Jon123	g0	oopse http://myip:6881
2010-01-26T20:16:00.000Z	Jon123	g0	the myip is your wan ip
