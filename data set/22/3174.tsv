2008-12-10T05:19:00.000Z	storrgie		i mean server
2008-12-10T05:19:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	storrgie	gedit? :-)
2008-12-10T05:19:00.000Z	storrgie	musikgoat|main	its a headless box, i want to edit the files over ssh
2008-12-10T05:20:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	storrgie	yes,  create a "connect to server" connection via sftp (ssh), and then edit with gedit
2008-12-10T05:20:00.000Z	storrgie	musikgoat|main	how do you do that? I know how to do sftp but dont know how to use it.
2008-12-10T05:21:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	storrgie	so start with the "connect to server" and if you plan to do this alot, i recommend creating a bookmark

2008-12-10T07:17:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	storrgie	i don't think the quattro cards work with the default drivers...
