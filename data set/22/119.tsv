2012-06-30T12:43:00.000Z	solidus-river		hey all, i installed 12.04 fine but when i reboot x is in a black screen with a cursor and some graphical glitches sometimes, how do i disable 3d?
2012-06-30T12:43:00.000Z	solidus-river		i believe this is bieng caused by 3d support
2012-06-30T12:43:00.000Z	solidus-river		is there a quick key combination?
2012-06-30T12:43:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	solidus-river	/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p
2012-06-30T12:44:00.000Z	solidus-river	ghostchick2013	from a basic terminal? the desktop is unusuable
2012-06-30T12:45:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	solidus-river	 in a ctrl + alt+ f1 type unity --reset or --replace
2012-06-30T12:46:00.000Z	solidus-river	ghostchick2013	i set it to auto log in the user, how can i remove that setting
2012-06-30T12:47:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	solidus-river	 did you tried the unity --reset first ?
2012-06-30T12:48:00.000Z	solidus-river	ghostchick2013	unity --reset segfaulted
2012-06-30T12:49:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	solidus-river	 you did it  in a ctrl + alt+f1 terminal no
2012-06-30T12:49:00.000Z	solidus-river	ghostchick2013	yes
2012-06-30T12:50:00.000Z	solidus-river	ghostchick2013	not as sudo though
2012-06-30T12:50:00.000Z	solidus-river	ghostchick2013	just in virtual terminal 1 as my main user
2012-06-30T12:56:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	solidus-river	 there is some gnome based ubuntu remasters i have seen
2012-06-30T12:57:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	solidus-river	 is unity still bugging on you?
2012-06-30T12:57:00.000Z	solidus-river	ghostchick2013	not sure, i realized i did apt-get update instead of apt-get upgrade so i'm running that now and seeing i fthat resolves the issue
2012-06-30T13:01:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	solidus-river	 normally we should be able to fix it all and  you could have gnome-shell, unity 3d and 2d at log in so you can choose
2012-06-30T13:11:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	solidus-river	   edit the lightdm.conf to log in the unity2d instead
2012-06-30T13:11:00.000Z	solidus-river	ghostchick2013	where would i locate this?
2012-06-30T13:17:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	solidus-river	 when you say it does not segfault, does it work though?
2012-06-30T13:17:00.000Z	solidus-river	ghostchick2013	no, it just successfully reset's and it shows a black screen with a cursor when i check terminal 7
2012-06-30T13:20:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	solidus-river	 i kinda think i know where the pb is now that you talked about gtk and such , will see with the pastebin
