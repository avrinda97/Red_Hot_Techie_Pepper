2006-02-22T06:37:00.000Z	Mordof	KerPlunk_	i thought cedega costed money
2006-02-22T06:38:00.000Z	KerPlunk_	Mordof	it does
2006-02-22T06:39:00.000Z	KerPlunk_	Mordof	transgaming created cedega off a fork of wine from awhile ago when wine was still under a bsd style license. You can have anonymous cvs access to cedega and compile it yourself.
2006-02-22T06:39:00.000Z	KerPlunk_		But there are legal restrictions and it's not technically free software.
2006-02-22T06:40:00.000Z	Mordof	KerPlunk_	any chance you could help me with thaT? :P
2006-02-22T06:40:00.000Z	KerPlunk_	Mordof	wine now is licensed under lgpl, which means any code from when the license was changed for wine from bsd to lgpl..can't be used by cedega.
2006-02-22T06:41:00.000Z	KerPlunk_	Mordof	just illegally download it
2006-02-22T06:41:00.000Z	KerPlunk_		fuck transgaming
2006-02-22T06:41:00.000Z	KerPlunk_	Mordof	check www.thepiratebay.org
2006-02-22T06:41:00.000Z	KerPlunk_		transgaming is "making a quick buck" off the back of the Wine project,
2006-02-22T06:42:00.000Z	Mordof	KerPlunk_	if it was just off of wine... cedega wouldnt support alot more
2006-02-22T06:42:00.000Z	Mordof		their support page is huge
2006-02-22T06:42:00.000Z	KerPlunk_	Mordof	right
2006-02-22T06:44:00.000Z	KerPlunk_	Mordof	type this as root "apt-get install bittornado; btdownloadcurses http://static.thepiratebay.org/downloadtorrent/3407082.torrent/Cedega_5_DEP.3407082.TPB.torrent;"
2006-02-22T06:44:00.000Z	KerPlunk_	Mordof	Then you have the free version of Cedega.
2006-02-22T06:44:00.000Z	Mordof	KerPlunk_	nah, i think im actually gonna pay for it
2006-02-22T06:44:00.000Z	Mordof	KerPlunk_	its not that expensive
2006-02-22T06:46:00.000Z	KerPlunk_		You mean you have to keep paying them every month
2006-02-22T06:47:00.000Z	Mordof	KerPlunk_	no, you only have to pay for 1 month.. you just dont get any service or stuff after that month ends, you can still use cedega
