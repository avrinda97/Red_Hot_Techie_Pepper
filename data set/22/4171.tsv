2008-02-29T10:08:00.000Z	nixbox		I have an HP dv2500 with Intel Wireless WifiLink 4965 AGN wireless card, somehow the wireless interface is not showing up after I have restarted the system, the wireless modules are loaded as indicated by lsmod, they are "iwl4965"
2008-02-29T10:09:00.000Z	nixbox		i have tried doing modeprobe -r iwl4965 and then doing modeprobe iwl4965 again
2008-02-29T10:09:00.000Z	nixbox		crackhead100, do you know if you card associates with an access point? you can check this using iwconfig
2008-02-29T10:10:00.000Z	crackhead100	nixbox	it's associated with the right access point..
2008-02-29T10:10:00.000Z	crackhead100		or seems to be..
2008-02-29T10:11:00.000Z	nixbox	crackhead100	is that access point under your control? Do you know it is running DHCP ?
2008-02-29T10:11:00.000Z	crackhead100	nixbox	it's a d-link wireless router, very simple, and yes, i think it uses dhcp.. dont know why it wouldnt.. it's connected fine before to othe rlaptops runnign windows and whatever else..
2008-02-29T10:12:00.000Z	nixbox		which wireless security mode does the wireless router use?

2008-02-29T10:14:00.000Z	nixbox	crackhead100	oh I mean, which security mode does the wireless router use? WPA, WEP etc?
2008-02-29T10:14:00.000Z	crackhead100		it's using wpa 40 bit or something right now.. 0000000000.. a form of that

2008-02-29T10:18:00.000Z	crackhead100		well, i was using wireless assistant.. but it doesn't work.. i try iwconfig and it sets fine.. but then i try to get a lease from the router and get a connection, and it doesnt.. just 255.255.255.255 during dhcpdiscover or whatever.. and then no leases.. sleeping..
