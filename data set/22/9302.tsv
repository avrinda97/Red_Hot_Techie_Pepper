2009-01-14T22:51:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	fire terminal and see host google.com
2009-01-14T22:51:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	or cat /etc/resolv.conf
2009-01-14T22:52:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	that way you see if its a name resolution problem
2009-01-14T22:52:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	konqueror is a browser
2009-01-14T22:53:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	a different take on what firefox, internet explorer and safari do
2009-01-14T22:54:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	how's it going?
2009-01-14T22:57:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	already solved the network problem or?
2009-01-14T22:59:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	you could very well have two ip's but in any ordinary desktop/laptop situation its gonna be more an annoyance than advantage
2009-01-14T22:59:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	you have two interfaces configured?
2009-01-14T23:00:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	just drop both and reconnect the one you want to use
2009-01-14T23:00:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	that'll do it
2009-01-14T23:01:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	did you already check host google.com and /etc/resolv.conf
2009-01-14T23:01:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	you could also check routes (sudo route), pastie.org the results
2009-01-14T23:03:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	map?
2009-01-14T23:03:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	it's a file
2009-01-14T23:03:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	containing information which your box uses to resolve internet names to ip addresses (and more...)
2009-01-14T23:05:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	gotta go, sorry, hope you get things sorted out with somebody else
2009-01-14T23:05:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	that looks just fine
2009-01-14T23:05:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	does host google.com work?
2009-01-14T23:05:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	type "host google.com" to terminal and press ret
2009-01-14T23:06:00.000Z	TTilus	biggi	i told you to pastie.org the result!
