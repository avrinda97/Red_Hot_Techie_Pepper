2012-04-18T13:02:00.000Z	PedroGomes		HI, if I have 2 OS in the same disk, each of them having it separated /boot partition.
2012-04-18T13:02:00.000Z	PedroGomes		When I'm in the second installed OS I can edit the grub.cgf to selected OS1 as default, but how can I do this when I'm at OS1?
2012-04-18T13:03:00.000Z	APoulos	PedroGomes	`sudo apt-get install grub-customizer`
2012-04-18T13:04:00.000Z	PedroGomes	APoulos	 graphical, or it was a command line interface
2012-04-18T13:04:00.000Z	APoulos	PedroGomes	its graphical
2012-04-18T13:05:00.000Z	PedroGomes	APoulos	thanks, and gl with your problem
2012-04-18T13:09:00.000Z	APoulos	PedroGomes	if you
2012-04-18T13:10:00.000Z	APoulos	PedroGomes	if you're trying to get Grub to recognize the new OS entry you may need go `sudo update grub`
2012-04-18T13:10:00.000Z	APoulos	PedroGomes	what OS's are you trying to dual boot?
2012-04-18T13:12:00.000Z	APoulos	PedroGomes	if I can ask, what OS's are you trying to dual boot? because if one of them is Windows, GRUB doesnt work well with windows
2012-04-18T13:12:00.000Z	PedroGomes	APoulos	for now a 12.04 and a 11.10, but I intend to do it generic. An yes i run update-grub, "update-grub2" to be precise
2012-04-18T13:12:00.000Z	PedroGomes	APoulos	only linuxs
2012-04-18T13:13:00.000Z	APoulos	PedroGomes	have you tried installing Boot-repair?
2012-04-18T13:14:00.000Z	APoulos	PedroGomes	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
2012-04-18T13:14:00.000Z	APoulos	PedroGomes	that should set your grub menu straight and find all your OS's
2012-04-18T13:15:00.000Z	APoulos	PedroGomes	APoulos, also - if you're using 11.10 - you can run Startup-Manager - sadly Startup-manager doesnt work well with 12.04
2012-04-18T13:15:00.000Z	PedroGomes	APoulos	I'm trying to automize a installation on remote servers so this kind of tool is not a choice
2012-04-18T13:15:00.000Z	APoulos	PedroGomes	oh, nevermind
2012-04-18T13:16:00.000Z	APoulos	PedroGomes	that's out of my league
2012-04-18T13:17:00.000Z	PedroGomes	APoulos	I have all working except for this little hack to change grub entries, but thanks anyway
2012-04-18T13:18:00.000Z	PedroGomes	APoulos	I guess I will do a forum post
2012-04-18T13:18:00.000Z	APoulos	PedroGomes	you're welcome - tried to help the best I could
