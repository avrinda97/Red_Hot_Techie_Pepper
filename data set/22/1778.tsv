2010-01-10T01:49:00.000Z	NoOneHere		i just booted with windows now
2010-01-10T01:49:00.000Z	DreamDemon	NoOneHere	Only for that modem to be used by multiple computers is some sort of NAT device like a broadband router
2010-01-10T01:49:00.000Z	NoOneHere	DreamDemon	i am using direct conection to the modem
2010-01-10T01:50:00.000Z	NoOneHere		so i should run on it: sudo pppoeconfig
2010-01-10T01:51:00.000Z	NoOneHere		and what it does ?
2010-01-10T01:51:00.000Z	DreamDemon	NoOneHere	thats a bad idea and not a good practice. Software firewalls are not the greatest and NAT gives you better general protection from the nasties of internet a$$holes
2010-01-10T01:53:00.000Z	NoOneHere		ok i will boot now on ubunto and will try to use it
2010-01-10T01:53:00.000Z	DreamDemon	NoOneHere	Also, connecting via usb to the cable modem is unnecessary as the modem can be connected to via ethernet.  Thus is youu done need ppoe, it's just a dhcp connection
2010-01-10T01:54:00.000Z	NoOneHere	DreamDemon	i connected my modem via ethernet
2010-01-10T01:54:00.000Z	DreamDemon	NoOneHere	Shouldnt need pppoe unless your ISP requires it
2010-01-10T01:54:00.000Z	NoOneHere		i am having dial up here on windows
2010-01-10T01:55:00.000Z	NoOneHere		ok i am going to ubunto now
2010-01-10T01:55:00.000Z	DreamDemon	NoOneHere	Do you have you ubunto box up and running?
2010-01-10T01:55:00.000Z	NoOneHere		DreamDemon:no i have to switch to it
2010-01-10T01:56:00.000Z	DreamDemon	NoOneHere	you can check the file /etc/network/interfaces to see if your nic is activating on boot
2010-01-10T01:56:00.000Z	NoOneHere	DreamDemon	i am logging in as admin
2010-01-10T01:57:00.000Z	DreamDemon	NoOneHere	 Your logging in as root on your ubuntu install?
2010-01-10T01:57:00.000Z	NoOneHere		DreamDemon:yes
2010-01-10T01:58:00.000Z	DreamDemon	NoOneHere	bad idea.  use the account it had you create when you installed and do sudo for everything.  You should not need to log into root as it poses some security risks, esp with you being directly connected to the internet
2010-01-10T01:58:00.000Z	DreamDemon		bah
2010-01-10T01:58:00.000Z	DreamDemon		It's amazing some of the bad habits/uneducated habits people have
2010-01-10T02:05:00.000Z	NoOneHere	DreamDemon	you here ?
