2009-01-13T22:37:00.000Z	wolter		hcitools cannot detect my bluetooth
2009-01-13T22:39:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	wolter	 I have a Ubuntu running on Dell XPS 1530.  It worked.  You only have to configure few things for touchpad (otherwise the mouse get crazy when you use touchpad) and few other things.  It's fine and working great for me.
2009-01-13T22:40:00.000Z	wolter	jinja-sheep	nice to know it.. my touchpad needed some fixes as well, but i am having problems with my webcam and my bluetooth... m1530 has bluetooth right?
2009-01-13T22:41:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	wolter	 Sure if you bought it with Bluetooth.  I was able to get my mouse to work with Bluetooth.
2009-01-13T22:41:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	wolter	 Not sure about webcam.  I have no needs for webcam + fingerprint.  <_<
2009-01-13T22:42:00.000Z	wolter	jinja-sheep	em, could you download cheese to see if it works right away and then you tell me?
2009-01-13T22:42:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	wolter	 Uh.  OKay.
2009-01-13T22:49:00.000Z	wolter	jinja-sheep	any success?
2009-01-13T22:49:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	wolter	 Had some issues at first.  And then it worked.
2009-01-13T22:49:00.000Z	wolter	jinja-sheep	which issues?
2009-01-13T22:50:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	wolter	 Nothing really.  It weren't showing anything at first.  Few restart with the applications then it displayed a video.  Overall, no issues.
2009-01-13T22:51:00.000Z	wolter	jinja-sheep	did it freeze when you tried to close it?
2009-01-13T22:51:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	wolter	 I closed it.  No freezing.
2009-01-13T22:53:00.000Z	wolter	jinja-sheep	sorry to bother you, but which webcam do you have?
2009-01-13T22:53:00.000Z	wolter	jinja-sheep	lsusb and tell me if it is omnivision
2009-01-13T22:55:00.000Z	wolter	jinja-sheep	no problem then...
2009-01-13T23:31:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	wolter	 What was it that you asked from me?
2009-01-13T23:31:00.000Z	wolter	jinja-sheep	do see which webcam you had built in
2009-01-13T23:31:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	wolter	 The command I meant.
2009-01-13T23:32:00.000Z	wolter	jinja-sheep	lsusb
2009-01-13T23:32:00.000Z	wolter	jinja-sheep	also, if you could run gstreamer-properties afterwards, that would be great
2009-01-13T23:34:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	wolter	 Let me get on the laptop.
