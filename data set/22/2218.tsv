2009-08-18T22:47:00.000Z	sqwable		is there a 64bit wubi or something? im running 32bit windows though..
2009-08-18T22:47:00.000Z	sqwable		:)
2009-08-18T22:49:00.000Z	sqwable		wtf.. why does wubi 8.10 run but not 9.04 :(  do not want
2009-08-18T22:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sqwable	Wubi is a bit bad for varous reasons, your better off doing a proper partitioned install.
2009-08-18T22:51:00.000Z	sqwable	sebsebseb	bad in what way? (I've had a wubi install of ubuntu on my laptop for months, didnt notice anything bad)
2009-08-18T22:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sqwable	things can mess up,  and then you can't boot up  Ubuntu, if  Windows mess's up  badly enough  Ubuntu will as well,   it  will  probably run a bit slower  than a proper partitioned install
2009-08-18T22:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sqwable	if  your Ubuntu install mess's up you can't just stick in a Live CD, and  gain access to your data
2009-08-18T22:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sqwable	with Wubi
2009-08-18T22:54:00.000Z	sqwable	sebsebseb	those are good points.. I guess I will do a proper install after checking if all my hardware is supported (I already have a partition from my removed fedora 11 install)
2009-08-18T22:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sqwable	not that difficult to set up a proper dual boot set up,  but even better get rid of Windows,  or   run it inside Ubuntu in a virtual machine,   depending on how much RAM you have, and what apps you want to run
2009-08-18T22:55:00.000Z	sqwable	sebsebseb	the only reason I use windows is for the games I play
2009-08-18T22:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sqwable	removed Fedora 11 why?  and left some kind of partition behind hmm?
2009-08-18T22:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sqwable	certain Windows games  people can get working  rather well in Wine  these days, or the commercial for money,  Crossover Games/Office  or  maybe the commercial for money Cedega.    Also Virtualbox 3.0  and such are getting there  for  3D games support  it seems,  but   people say 3D  Windows games are slow in Virtualbox.   There are also good native Linux games, you just need to know where to get them from.
2009-08-18T22:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sqwable	it has that now or was that 8 hmm,   well  you can try 3D gaming in it now if you want
2009-08-18T22:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sqwable	probably won't have much luck though
2009-08-18T23:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sqwable	yeah and there's http://www.reactos.org   been around quite a lot of years now, but development is slow,  so still alpha.   ,but  yeah eventually  loads of people won't  need  Windows anymore, espesailly if  a lot more apps  go online,   off  topic now, and I think this is a nice ending for it
2009-08-18T23:03:00.000Z	sqwable	sebsebseb	oh, reactOS theyre still working on that? :P
2009-08-18T23:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sqwable	yep :)
2009-08-18T23:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sqwable	more and more apps go online, and then eventaully  will get to a stage where people just need a simple  OS with a browser,   and  then who needs Windows?
2009-08-18T23:05:00.000Z	sqwable	sebsebseb	windows lite/cloud/web3.0 will takes its place then
2009-08-18T23:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sqwable	ReactOS and Wine  use some of the  same code or whatever,  check out there site properly  if  you  want,  it  explains stuff
2009-08-18T23:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sqwable	off topic  the end,   back to support or whatever,   in  my case  Karmic alpha4 stuff :)
