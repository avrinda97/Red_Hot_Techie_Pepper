2005-10-01T09:59:00.000Z	sdali		Has anyone successfully upgraded libc6 to 2.3.2.ds1-21? If so, please tell me where you got it, and how you installed it.
2005-10-01T10:00:00.000Z	crimsun	sdali	do not mess with libc6 if you don't know darned well what you're doing.
2005-10-01T10:01:00.000Z	crimsun	sdali	transcode is in breezy/multiverse
2005-10-01T10:02:00.000Z	crimsun	sdali	don't even think about trying to fudge libc6 into your Ubuntu system
2005-10-01T10:02:00.000Z	sdali	crimsun	but it tells me that it needs the updated libc6
2005-10-01T10:03:00.000Z	crimsun	sdali	you should test breezy, then, since transcode is in breezy/multiverse
2005-10-01T10:03:00.000Z	sdali	crimsun	Here's a duh question for you. Can I use Breezy "ports" if I've got Hoary loaded?
2005-10-01T10:04:00.000Z	crimsun	sdali	there are backports for hoary based on breezy packages. I don't recommend them generally.
2005-10-01T10:05:00.000Z	sdali	crimsun	Thanks for the help.
2005-10-02T06:16:00.000Z	crimsun	sdali	by default Ubuntu does nothing with iptables+netfilter
2005-10-02T06:16:00.000Z	sdali	crimsun	Then how in the heck did it get enabled, with somewhat intelligent entries if ubuntu didn't do it?
2005-10-02T06:18:00.000Z	crimsun	sdali	what got enabled?
2005-10-02T06:18:00.000Z	sdali	crimsun	/var/log/messages shows it like this:
2005-10-02T06:18:00.000Z	crimsun	sdali	that means there's kernel support for it enabled. That doesn't mean a firewall is ACTIVE.
2005-10-02T06:19:00.000Z	sdali	crimsun	iptables shows my DNS servers, both of my eth interfaces, and it appears that it has also looked at the static routes I have setup.
2005-10-02T06:20:00.000Z	crimsun	sdali	huh?
2005-10-02T06:20:00.000Z	sdali	crimsun	shorewall isn't enabled, and firestarter was never configured.
2005-10-02T06:21:00.000Z	crimsun	sdali	I have no idea what you're asking
2005-10-02T06:21:00.000Z	crimsun	sdali	there is no firewall configured by default. If you want one enabled, you have to install one and configure it, then activate it.
2005-10-02T06:22:00.000Z	sdali	crimsun	"iptables -L " shows that something has considered my "setup" (interfaces, DNS, static routes) and it has made the entries in the iptables (kernel). So, if ubuntu didn't do that for me, then ... ?
2005-10-02T06:23:00.000Z	sdali	crimsun	I guess I need to look closer to see if firestarter did it for me.
