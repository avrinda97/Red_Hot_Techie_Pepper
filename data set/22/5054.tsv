2008-07-22T21:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fwaokda	 theres some tricks to do that. Or thers some Hit F12 and have one popdown tools also.
2009-07-15T10:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fwaokda	 tell the channel your video card for starters and how its connected to the monitor.
2009-07-15T10:59:00.000Z	fwaokda	Dr_Willis	ATI Radeon 4850 HD
2009-07-15T10:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fwaokda	 i find that janotor tool to be the kind of thing that should of not been included
2009-07-15T11:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fwaokda	 it most likely removed your fglrx drivers - you could rerun the 'hardware drivers' tool and it may want to reinstall them
2009-07-15T11:00:00.000Z	fwaokda	Dr_Willis	ya I know I thought it was gonna get rid of unused packages but boy was I wrong
2009-07-15T11:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fwaokda	 it removes unofficial packages I think. :)  ive never really messed withit once i saw what it was wanting to remove
2009-07-15T11:01:00.000Z	fwaokda	Dr_Willis	well I didn't use hardware drivers tool instead I installed them manually from drivers @ ati.com
2009-07-15T11:01:00.000Z	fwaokda	Dr_Willis	the ones in hardware drivers didn't work for me
2009-07-15T11:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fwaokda	 it wants to remove opera and a few other  not in the normal repos packages here..
2009-07-15T11:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fwaokda	 i would reinstall them from ati.com - if there was a kernel upgrade THAT would rewuire you to reinstall them from ati.com each time the kernel updates
2009-07-15T11:02:00.000Z	fwaokda	Dr_Willis	ok I'll do a reinstall of them thanks
2009-07-15T11:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fwaokda	 that will be needed EACH time theres a kernel update.. most likely.. somthing to rember
2009-07-15T11:03:00.000Z	fwaokda	Dr_Willis	ok thanks
2011-08-23T00:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fwaokda	 windows wants a cr and lf at the end of each line.. linux/unix only needs one.. theres some text2dos or similer commands that can 'fix' it..
2011-08-23T00:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fwaokda	 may be dos2unix or unix2dos commands.. been ages since ive had to mess withit.
2011-08-23T00:37:00.000Z	fwaokda	Dr_Willis	for windows or ubuntu?
2011-08-23T00:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fwaokda	 yes.. :)  i imgine its been ported to windows some how.. and its in linux.
2011-08-23T00:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fwaokda	 theres prob. a dozen tools to convert the things.
2011-08-23T00:38:00.000Z	fwaokda	Dr_Willis	well i just need one ;P
2011-08-23T00:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fwaokda	 so you need to decide what os you want to do the converting in...
