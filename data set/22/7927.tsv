2005-12-14T15:45:00.000Z	Badm4n		i have been tried to use ipmassq and edit /etc/ipmasq/rules/A80firewall.def ... then i put EXTERNAL_TCP_ALLOW="80 443" .. why my client still can access other port ?

2005-12-14T15:48:00.000Z	soundray	Badm4n	I'm not the firewall expert, but I heard that firestarter is fairly easy to use.
2005-12-14T15:48:00.000Z	Badm4n		i use ipmassq during to handle my iptables rules too
2005-12-14T15:49:00.000Z	Badm4n		cause im newbie here
2005-12-14T15:50:00.000Z	Badm4n	soundray	if i use firestarter should i apt-get remove my ipmassq ?
2005-12-14T15:50:00.000Z	soundray	Badm4n	no, if there's a conflict, apt-get will warn you.
2005-12-14T15:52:00.000Z	Badm4n		ok
2005-12-14T15:52:00.000Z	Badm4n		firestarter running
2005-12-14T15:52:00.000Z	Badm4n		what shoul i put
2005-12-14T15:52:00.000Z	Badm4n		to block all port from client except 80 and 443
2005-12-14T15:54:00.000Z	soundray	Badm4n	as I say I don't know much about firewalls on Ubuntu. Look in /usr/share/doc/firestarter, maybe starting with README.Debian. Try man firestarter. Look at config files in /etc/firestarter, etc.
