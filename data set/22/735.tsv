2011-08-19T03:55:00.000Z	cykros		and then probably remake the user.
2011-08-19T03:55:00.000Z	cykros		idk, someone else may have a simpler alternative
2011-08-19T03:56:00.000Z	cykros		hmm. idk, never used thunar
2011-08-19T03:57:00.000Z	cykros		yea, scp, or sftp
2011-08-19T03:58:00.000Z	cykros		alright, trying admin privileges on my new user. this better not work, because i don't need another user able to sudo./
2011-08-19T03:59:00.000Z	cykros		though, i guess i could change my sudo policy to require the root password instead of the user's
2011-08-19T03:59:00.000Z	cykros		it's not that i don't trust my user, its that i don't want the account to be used for privilege escalation if compromised.
2011-08-19T03:59:00.000Z	cykros		heh, the user happens to be my girlfriend of 1+ years, and meanwhile is computer illiterate
2011-08-19T03:59:00.000Z	cykros		well, may as well be.
2011-08-19T04:00:00.000Z	cykros		ahh, good. that didn't work.
2011-08-19T04:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cykros	What is the output of "groups"?
2011-08-19T04:05:00.000Z	cykros	Jordan_U	adm cdrom plugdev admin along with the group named after the user itself
2011-08-19T04:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cykros	You're missing "audio".
2011-08-19T04:07:00.000Z	cykros	Jordan_U	see, my primary user doesn't have audio either.
2011-08-19T04:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cykros	Your user should be in the audio group by default, can you think of why you aren't in the audio group?
2011-08-19T04:09:00.000Z	cykros	Jordan_U	when i created the account at installation, it was not selected
2011-08-19T04:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cykros	Have you tried muting then unmuting the volume as the new user?
2011-08-19T04:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cykros	What do you see when you run "alsamixer" as the new user?
2011-08-19T04:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cykros	You have two sound cards?
2011-08-19T04:36:00.000Z	cykros	Jordan_U	at this point i think i'm scratching my hypothesis that this is a permissions thing and more a pulseaudio being weird thing.
2011-08-19T04:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cykros	Try asking in #pulseaudio
2011-08-19T04:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cykros	You're welcome.
