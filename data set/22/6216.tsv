2007-01-30T12:08:00.000Z	genii	mooky	Maybe put user lpadmin or so in group www-user it it's trying to use some web interface
2007-01-30T12:10:00.000Z	genii	mooky	If you can find the root of the webpage system for that page check then to see if creating a web password for it with htpasswd works
2007-01-30T12:11:00.000Z	genii	mooky	What url is it using?
2007-01-30T12:11:00.000Z	genii	mooky	So in main area of /var/www
2007-01-30T12:13:00.000Z	genii	mooky	Ah, OK. So it's the line printing daemon running on port 631
2007-01-30T12:14:00.000Z	genii	mooky	If using inetd check the inetd.conf file to see if there is an entry for it. Also in /etc/services to see the port 631 entry is uncommented and so on
2007-01-30T12:15:00.000Z	genii	mooky	np
2007-01-30T12:17:00.000Z	genii	mooky	Anyhow, occurs to me that if your system is using inetd/xinetd you may not have some default entry for lpd on port 631. also the port may be still commented out in the /etc/services section
2007-01-30T12:19:00.000Z	genii	mooky	Check your cgi-common area then. I think it's usually somewhere like /usrshare/cgi-bin
2007-01-30T12:20:00.000Z	genii	mooky	It must have some embedded webserver otherwise it wouldn't run.
2007-01-30T12:21:00.000Z	genii	mooky	Well, regardless of what server is underneath then, the executables for it will be in the cgi common dirs
2007-01-30T12:21:00.000Z	genii	mooky	Might be permissions are screwy there for it to run or so
2007-01-30T12:25:00.000Z	genii	mooky	Since multiple webservers use the common cgi-bin dir, and web applications which use executables normally look there for these things. Also in this directory structure there is usually found application-specific directories containing perl or php scripts etc which are for specific control programs.
2007-01-30T12:27:00.000Z	genii	mooky	LOL OK... I'll look into exactly where this thing should be then. Do you know the exact packagename again?
2007-01-30T12:28:00.000Z	genii	mooky	OK researching now
2007-01-30T12:29:00.000Z	genii	mooky	Do you get any result from cli command lpinfo -v ?
2007-01-30T12:29:00.000Z	genii	mooky	OK
2007-01-30T12:30:00.000Z	genii	mooky	OK Trying to find out
2007-01-30T12:31:00.000Z	genii	mooky	http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/10/13/enabling-cupsys-web-admin-interface/
2007-01-30T12:32:00.000Z	genii	mooky	Lemme know if it works :)
2007-01-30T12:33:00.000Z	genii	mooky	NP, but wasn't me that solved it LOL
