2007-12-06T17:59:00.000Z	peter77		hi, I'm having problems mounting an NTFS partition, it used to mount fine before gutsy
2007-12-06T17:59:00.000Z	peter77		I have shutdown windows properly and reinstalled the ntfs-3g drivers
2007-12-06T18:01:00.000Z	peter77		so can anyone help me with my ntfs mounting problem?
2007-12-06T18:03:00.000Z	peter77		I know what ntfs-3g is, I want to know why fuse is claiming that the device is busy
2007-12-06T18:03:00.000Z	damaltor	peter77	while mounting?
2007-12-06T18:03:00.000Z	damaltor	peter77	or while unmounting?
2007-12-06T18:06:00.000Z	damaltor	peter77	is the mount point created?

2007-12-06T18:08:00.000Z	damaltor	peter77	does read-only mounting work with "mount"?
2007-12-06T18:15:00.000Z	peter77	damaltor	what would be the command to mount a partition read only?
