2012-02-28T07:37:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	did windows show in the terminal?

2012-02-28T07:52:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	cool hold on
2012-02-28T07:55:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	couple of problems you need a boot flag on the windows partition and you need these files to boot it  /bootmgr /Boot/BCD I can help you do thi if you have a W7 recovery or install disc. You also appear to have a boot partition sda1 that you don't need.
2012-02-28T07:58:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	you need the files I posted to boot windows in the windows partition.
2012-02-28T07:58:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	windows will not boot without these.  /bootmgr /Boot/BCD
2012-02-28T07:59:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	you should see this Boot files:        /bootmgr /Boot/BCD  /Windows/System32/winload.exe
2012-02-28T08:00:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	easy fix with a recovery or install disc of W7.
2012-02-28T08:04:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	cool you need to install gparted in ubuntu and put a boot flag on the sdb1 partition I can give you the commands to load those files using the repair terminal from the booted W7 disc, this will not work if you do not put that bootflag on the windows partition first.
2012-02-28T08:15:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	cool do you have a W7 recovery or install disc or thumb that can be booted?
2012-02-28T08:15:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	yep. :)
2012-02-28T08:16:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	cool
2012-02-28T08:16:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	no problem.:)
2012-02-28T08:49:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	cool boot it and follow these instructions there is a W7 forum link for orientation if needed. http://paste.ubuntu.com/813664/
2012-02-28T08:52:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	cool you will get a chkdsk prompt to run on reboot, you will need to boot straight to winows or into ubuntu to run sudo update-grub to add the windows to grub.
2012-02-28T09:04:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	is it the same 32bit or 64bit?
2012-02-28T09:07:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	not sure on that you might try the ##windows channel.
2012-02-28T09:09:00.000Z	urfr332gO	phi__	strange realy NTLDR is XP I believe.
