2008-06-29T11:28:00.000Z	the1		hi
2008-06-29T11:28:00.000Z	maco	the1	welcome to the matrix
2008-06-29T11:29:00.000Z	the1	maco	how to setup my ssh server
2008-06-29T11:29:00.000Z	maco	the1	install openssh-server
2008-06-29T11:32:00.000Z	maco	the1	uh, so what else do you ned to do?
2008-06-29T11:33:00.000Z	the1	maco	: got 1 modem and 1 router
2008-06-29T11:33:00.000Z	the1	maco	and 1 public IP
2008-06-29T11:33:00.000Z	maco	the1	ok....? so daisy chain the router to the modem to the internet and connect yourself to the router...i dont get it
2008-06-29T11:33:00.000Z	maco	the1	and you want to know how to set up port forwarding on your router?
2008-06-29T11:33:00.000Z	maco	the1	that'd be a question for the router's documentation
2008-06-29T11:34:00.000Z	the1	maco	yaaa...but on my router or modem
2008-06-29T11:34:00.000Z	maco	the1	if they both do dhcp, then both
2008-06-29T11:34:00.000Z	the1	maco	yaa got dhcp
2008-06-29T11:34:00.000Z	the1	maco	on modem what port should I put
2008-06-29T11:34:00.000Z	maco	the1	er, i didnt mean dhcp, i meant NAT
2008-06-29T11:35:00.000Z	maco	the1	22 is always ssh or sftp
2008-06-29T11:36:00.000Z	maco	the1	it's possible to do it on other ports if you need to ssh through somewhere that doesn't allow you to use ssh connections...sshing over 443 is generally safe since 443 is https so everybody allows it
2008-06-29T11:36:00.000Z	the1	maco	then I should put port 22 on my modem and router.
2008-06-29T11:36:00.000Z	maco	the1	try just the router first. if that doesnt work, then modem too
2008-06-29T11:37:00.000Z	the1	maco	how about my machine, do I need to configure the IPTABLES
2008-06-29T11:39:00.000Z	maco	the1	iptables will automatically allow the daemon to listen on 22 when it's started
2008-06-29T11:40:00.000Z	the1	maco	ok
