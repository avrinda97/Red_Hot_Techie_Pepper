2010-02-09T03:27:00.000Z	vinse		i plugged my pc into my work network, i can see other machines but i cant get to the internet -- i cant ping google by name or ip -- any help is appreciated
2010-02-09T03:27:00.000Z	nibbler	vinse	check if you got a default gateway (route -n) and how far you get (tracepath www.google.com)
2010-02-09T03:28:00.000Z	vinse	nibbler	i do not have any gateway listed when i do sudo route
2010-02-09T03:28:00.000Z	nibbler	vinse	so your companys DHCP does not assign a gateway to you?  can be.... no gateway, no inet
2010-02-09T03:29:00.000Z	vinse	nibbler	i'm sure they'd be willing to assign me one, i just didn't get it
2010-02-09T03:30:00.000Z	nibbler	vinse	do you use dhcp for configuration, or did you assign an ip yourself?
2010-02-09T03:30:00.000Z	vinse	nibbler	i had to explicitly set my ip in order to ping anything.  i couldn't even see other machines until i did "sudo ifconifg eth0 inet 192..."
2010-02-09T03:31:00.000Z	nibbler	vinse	ah ok, then you need to set your router the like, just check the other boxes for their router (and dns)
2010-02-09T03:32:00.000Z	vinse	nibbler	router = gateway?
2010-02-09T03:32:00.000Z	nibbler	vinse	yep
2010-02-09T03:32:00.000Z	vinse	nibbler	and how do i set those explicitly? also with ifconfig?
2010-02-09T03:32:00.000Z	nibbler	vinse	first try : sudo dhclient eth0 - maybe there is a dhcp server running.
2010-02-09T03:33:00.000Z	nibbler	vinse	dns is set by "nameserver 1.2.3.4" in /etc/resolv.conf, router by "route add default gw 1.1.1.3"
2010-02-09T03:33:00.000Z	vinse	nibbler	i tried that before i set my ip, it didnt work
2010-02-09T03:33:00.000Z	nibbler	vinse	both can be controlled via /etc/network/interfaces for a more permanent setup
2010-02-09T03:34:00.000Z	nibbler	vinse	well, dont now how you tried before
2010-02-09T03:34:00.000Z	nibbler	vinse	just pick up the info at another box
2010-02-09T03:40:00.000Z	vinse	nibbler	thank you! setting everything explicitly did the trick
2010-02-09T03:40:00.000Z	nibbler	vinse	welcome
2010-02-17T02:40:00.000Z	vinse	nibbler	it's a pretty old laptop, but an ibm, not anything exotic
2010-02-17T02:40:00.000Z	nibbler	vinse	once you have a working one, be happy. onrmally you should never have any problem with it, unless you have hardware that just "does not work" (means: not supported by kernel). whatever, even after updating, you can chose to boot an older kernel in the boot menu, if the latest one should be broken for oyu
2010-02-17T02:41:00.000Z	nibbler	vinse	could be some problem with the network driver.... could... but who cares, it seems to be fixed :)
