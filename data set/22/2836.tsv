2009-02-16T04:48:00.000Z	codeguru	wickers	what was the issue
2009-02-16T04:48:00.000Z	wickers	codeguru	it served me well, did dual monitors with xrandr without a fuss, etc...
2009-02-16T04:49:00.000Z	wickers	codeguru	flash was too much for it to handle, and some other desktop tasks bogged it down quite a bit
2009-02-16T04:49:00.000Z	wickers	codeguru	but mind you, this was a 701, so celeron 700mhz proc
2009-02-16T04:49:00.000Z	codeguru		so would you suggest i go from xandros to ubuntu ?
2009-02-16T04:49:00.000Z	codeguru		the problem is xandros is too restrictive
2009-02-16T04:50:00.000Z	wickers	codeguru	the big thing was video playback... linux, even with all the right drivers and others, just did not fair well with video playback on heavy codecs... so I installed XP through an image called EeeXP
2009-02-16T04:50:00.000Z	wickers		intel video on XP sadly is much better
2009-02-16T04:50:00.000Z	codeguru		xandros is really useless, and i personally hate windows
2009-02-16T04:50:00.000Z	wickers	codeguru	I actually found the best linux for the EeePC was xandros with extensions
2009-02-16T04:51:00.000Z	wickers	codeguru	have you unified the filesystem for extra space? added other repos?
2009-02-16T04:51:00.000Z	codeguru		how do i get the extensions, i wanted to java 6.0 and couldn't get it
2009-02-16T04:51:00.000Z	wickers	codeguru	go to eeeuser.com
2009-02-16T04:51:00.000Z	wickers	codeguru	look at the wiki there
2009-02-16T04:51:00.000Z	codeguru		ok thank let me take a look
2009-02-16T04:51:00.000Z	wickers	codeguru	it says how to do pretty much any software tweak for your EeePC
2009-02-16T04:52:00.000Z	wickers	codeguru	ubuntu runs rather well for genearl use... but it is a bit heavier than the default xandros, so it all depends on your preference and how you use the EeePC
2009-02-16T04:53:00.000Z	codeguru		thanks wickers i have a relatively newer model, i.e. 900 mhz
2009-02-16T04:54:00.000Z	codeguru		and don't want to do much fancy things on it and for the most part xandros serves the purpose
2009-02-16T04:54:00.000Z	wickers	codeguru	but they don't run at that speed unless it's specific models... mine was listed as a 900mhz celeron but it's always downclocked on the 701s
2009-02-16T04:54:00.000Z	wickers	codeguru	some of the 900 series models run at the full rate by default...
