2008-07-15T11:50:00.000Z	Shujah	chriswr	canceling out how?
2008-07-15T11:54:00.000Z	Shujah	chriswr	most probably because of sound issues. change the sound mixer in menu > preferences > sounds and try to run two media apps simultaneously
2008-07-15T11:55:00.000Z	Shujah	chriswr	or run rhythem player then start titem like this > artsdsp totem
2008-07-15T12:02:00.000Z	Shujah	chriswr	there would be a a tab device under it. change it to alsa if its not there already
2008-07-15T12:03:00.000Z	Shujah	chriswr	you can use top or ps but not exactly a task manager like win
2008-07-15T12:06:00.000Z	Shujah	chriswr	and whats the result?
2008-07-15T12:09:00.000Z	Shujah	chriswr	yeah try moving it to alsa - or you can try a small tweak before, put eberything to pulseaudio & >  sudo gedit /etc/pulse/daemon.conf  serach line ; use-pid-file = yes < change yes to no and save , reboot
2008-07-15T12:20:00.000Z	Shujah	chriswr	do you have libflashsupport installed?
2008-07-15T12:21:00.000Z	Shujah	chriswr	yes
2008-07-15T12:23:00.000Z	Shujah	chriswr	go to menu > pref > sounds > turn esd on - should be in second tab
2008-07-15T12:26:00.000Z	Shujah	chriswr	sudo apt-get install alsa-oss <- this will install alsa-oss
2008-07-15T12:27:00.000Z	Shujah	chriswr	try like this opena  sound app run a mp3 or something open second app like > terminal alsa-oss rhythem box or any media player
2008-07-15T12:31:00.000Z	Shujah	chriswr	sorry its aoss
2008-07-15T12:33:00.000Z	Shujah	chriswr	go to menu - pref - sounds and change everything to pulse audio - that is first two to auto detect 3rd 4th to pulseaudio and last to alsa
2008-07-15T12:37:00.000Z	Shujah	chriswr	if the problem surtfaces again you might kill the pulseaudio and hopefully it'll work
