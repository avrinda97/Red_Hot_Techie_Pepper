2008-06-24T15:51:00.000Z	Danish989		does anyone know how to find ip address using ubuntu's network tools?
2008-06-24T15:51:00.000Z	Danish989		or how to work netstat in ubuntu?
2008-06-24T15:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Danish989	ip address of what?
2008-06-24T15:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Danish989	if you want that you can get netstat -a
2008-06-24T15:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Danish989	then start a p2p file transfer and run it again and compare
2008-06-24T15:55:00.000Z	Danish989	ActionParsnip	thanks :) I did the same in windows, but just couldn't figure it out in ubuntu, I'm new to linux
2008-06-24T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Danish989	same command
2008-06-24T15:55:00.000Z	Danish989	ActionParsnip	yeah, totally slipped out of my mind that terminal is the command substitute
2008-06-24T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Danish989	i use yakuake in kde
2008-06-24T15:56:00.000Z	Danish989	ActionParsnip	I read somewhere that it should be easier and probably even GUI based if we use the Ubuntu Network Tools?
2008-06-24T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Danish989	gui is slow man
2008-06-24T15:56:00.000Z	Danish989	ActionParsnip	true, but is that possible?
2008-06-24T15:57:00.000Z	Danish989	ActionParsnip	I do see a netstat tab in the network tools, cannot figure out how that works though ... and are there any particular advantages of using Yakuake over the default terminal?
2008-06-24T15:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Danish989	i dunno, i se cli so much now
2008-06-24T15:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Danish989	its a cli command
2008-06-24T15:58:00.000Z	Danish989	ActionParsnip	does Gnome have some terminal emulators of it's own?
2008-06-24T15:58:00.000Z	Danish989	ActionParsnip	or do I install Yakuake with all those KDE packages
2008-06-24T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Danish989	you'll need kde apps for yakuake
2008-06-24T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Danish989	gnome uses terminal
2008-06-24T15:59:00.000Z	Danish989	ActionParsnip	aren't there more?
2008-06-24T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Danish989	theres thousands
2008-06-24T16:00:00.000Z	Danish989	ActionParsnip	do you know any good one?
