2006-08-04T15:06:00.000Z	goonies		my wireless connection seems to drop every 15 minutes, can someone help me figure out the problem
2006-08-04T15:07:00.000Z	ucordes	goonies	you allready checked if you have a stable signal?
2006-08-04T15:07:00.000Z	goonies	ucordes	how do u check that
2006-08-04T15:08:00.000Z	ucordes	goonies	you should have a fancy green bar, top right that shows your wireless status. click on it to get more info
2006-08-04T15:09:00.000Z	ucordes	goonies	you can also check it out in console: iwlist eth0 scan <- where eth0 is your network interface
2006-08-04T15:11:00.000Z	ucordes	goonies	nothing it was there out of the box. just right click your panel and click add to panel. you should see network monitor

2006-08-04T15:14:00.000Z	ucordes	goonies	ok then your interface does not support signal quality then.
2006-08-04T15:14:00.000Z	ucordes	goonies	may i ask what your ap is? you in a college or something?
2006-08-04T15:16:00.000Z	ucordes	goonies	did you install any driver for your interface?
2006-08-04T15:19:00.000Z	goonies	ucordes	well i can tell what my signal strength is on windows =\
2006-08-04T15:19:00.000Z	ucordes	goonies	so you gotta know wether you get a stable signal or not

2006-08-04T15:28:00.000Z	ucordes	goonies	if i knew how you could try to debug your connection and see what happens when the disc. appears. but if you can't even tell what signal quality you have...
