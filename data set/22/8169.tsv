2005-10-18T06:33:00.000Z	damo21		i cant get breezy on my laptop it keeps failing
2005-10-18T06:33:00.000Z	Kamion	damo21	alt-f3 and look for error messages there
2005-10-18T06:33:00.000Z	Kamion	damo21	smells of a scratched CD or a dirty CD drive to me, though
2005-10-18T06:35:00.000Z	damo21	Kamion	can u help me im not sure what to do with this
2005-10-18T06:36:00.000Z	Kamion	damo21	well, there should be dpkg output on alt-f3 about the installation of initramfs-tools
2005-10-18T06:36:00.000Z	Kamion	damo21	does it look like that was successful, or are there error messages?
2005-10-18T06:37:00.000Z	Kamion	damo21	oh, "packages have unmet dependencies", didn't see that. Is it more specific than that?
2005-10-18T06:37:00.000Z	damo21	Kamion	it says base-config: Depends: gettext-base but is not going to be installed
2005-10-18T06:37:00.000Z	Kamion	damo21	ok, sounds like something failed earlier on; I'd (a) try burning your CD at a lower speed, (b) if that doesn't help, invest in a CD / CD-drive cleaning kit
2005-10-18T06:38:00.000Z	damo21	Kamion	yeah i wish i had a few blanks this stupid rw cd is buggered
2005-10-18T06:41:00.000Z	Kamion	damo21	umount /cdrom; eject
2005-10-18T06:42:00.000Z	Kamion	damo21	anna-install eject-udeb, try again
2005-10-18T06:43:00.000Z	Kamion	damo21	(this is dodgy installer hacking, but never mind)
