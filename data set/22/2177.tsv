2009-09-03T22:34:00.000Z	Quasar1048		I never understood why this stuff works so easily for everyone else...
2009-09-03T22:34:00.000Z	Quasar1048		this stuff just needs to get more organized, its all a disaster
2009-09-03T22:35:00.000Z	Quasar1048		ten different tutorials to do the same thing- each one works  for a different person... shouldnt be like that
2009-09-03T22:35:00.000Z	Pici	Quasar1048	Can you pastebin the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list using http://paste.ubuntu.com please?

2009-09-03T22:41:00.000Z	Pici	Quasar1048	Your repositories were messed up, the pastebinned link I shared should fix everything.  Just run your normal update procedure and you should be all set.

2009-09-03T23:06:00.000Z	Pici	Quasar1048	I need to deal with another issue here at work, That error isn't tough to fix, but I unforunately don't have time to help you out.  Someone else here should be able to assist you, just explain the current issue you are having (once you get this working your update process should work fine)
2009-09-03T23:09:00.000Z	Quasar1048	Pici	Thats alright... actually that works out, because I have something i have to do as well, lol. Thanks for the help though.. I'm sure I'll get this fixed, somehow I always manage...
