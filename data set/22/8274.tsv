2005-09-18T08:21:00.000Z	notnilC		there seems to be only certain things i can't access on the net with firefox
2005-09-18T08:22:00.000Z	notnilC		anyone got ideas on why that it?
2005-09-18T08:22:00.000Z	notnilC		is?
2005-09-18T08:22:00.000Z	notnilC		most websites
2005-09-18T08:23:00.000Z	sipior	notnilC	maybe you have ecn turned on?
2005-09-18T08:23:00.000Z	sipior	notnilC	what is in the file /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp
2005-09-18T08:25:00.000Z	sipior	notnilC	different problem, then. can you ping the same sites?
2005-09-18T08:25:00.000Z	notnilC	sipior	yes
2005-09-18T08:25:00.000Z	sipior	notnilC	do you have a web proxy turned on?
2005-09-18T08:27:00.000Z	sipior	notnilC	Edit->Preferences->General->Connection
2005-09-18T08:30:00.000Z	sipior	notnilC	but you can ping hotmail?
2005-09-18T08:30:00.000Z	sipior	notnilC	try another browser?
2005-09-18T08:33:00.000Z	sipior	notnilC	not sure i follow you. the browser is on the local machine?
2005-09-18T08:33:00.000Z	sipior	notnilC	and it doesn't work either?
2005-09-18T08:35:00.000Z	sipior	notnilC	is hotmail the only site you can't reach? maybe a certificate problem?
2005-09-18T08:36:00.000Z	sipior	notnilC	all right, i'm officially baffled. maybe the problem is the underlying network?
2005-09-18T08:37:00.000Z	sipior	notnilC	do you have a firewall between you and the outside world?
2005-09-18T08:38:00.000Z	sipior	notnilC	maybe outgoing http is blocked to certain sites
2005-09-18T08:38:00.000Z	sipior	notnilC	though it admittedly seems rather random
2005-09-18T08:38:00.000Z	sipior	notnilC	hmm. sorry, without seeing the machine directly, i'm out of things to try
