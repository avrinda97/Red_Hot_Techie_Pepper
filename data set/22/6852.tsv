2006-11-06T06:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	user-land	gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-11-06T06:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	user-land	<hint> please know what your doing before trying it as it can leave your system bootless
2006-11-06T07:00:00.000Z	user-land	gnomefreak	i don't know what i'm doing :-) i see menu.lst is still the one from Ubuntu. however i have now a boot record that lists Suse as the first option, and i would like to place Ubuntu (which is now second) there first. do i need to do this in lilo ?
2006-11-06T07:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	user-land	look at help.ubuntu.com there is a section in there that tells you how to do it
2006-11-06T07:02:00.000Z	user-land	gnomefreak	is it searchable ? i don't see grub mentioned there.
2006-11-06T07:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	user-land	hold on ill get you the page

2006-11-06T07:06:00.000Z	user-land	gnomefreak	thanks, but the menu.lst is still the original ubuntu one. but it is not in effect anymore. how can i overwrite the record now in effect, generated by Suse ?
2006-11-06T07:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	user-land	did you install ubuntu or suse last
2006-11-06T07:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	user-land	it should already be using suses than

2006-12-21T06:41:00.000Z	gnomefreak	user-land	does it concern 3.0?
2006-12-21T06:42:00.000Z	gnomefreak	user-land	if you have a link let me see it anyway but if 2.0.0.1 fixes it than its already been requested
