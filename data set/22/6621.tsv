2010-01-20T10:00:00.000Z	IdleOne	scunizi	after resizing doesn't gparted auto mount the partition?
2010-01-20T10:01:00.000Z	scunizi	IdleOne	no. not unless you tell it to
2010-05-14T18:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	scunizi	the cd and dvd do the same default install, just that the dvd has more packages on it
2010-05-14T18:28:00.000Z	scunizi	IdleOne	that's what I thought. so it shouldn't take up any more space than the standard install..
2010-05-14T18:28:00.000Z	IdleOne	scunizi	nope it should'nt
2010-05-14T18:29:00.000Z	scunizi	IdleOne	b a n k i x seems to think it does. I'm of your opinion though.
2010-05-14T18:34:00.000Z	IdleOne	scunizi	I have not tried a DVD install but I would assume that default == default. the dvd may offer to install extra packages which the cd does not do, in that case I can see how it would be easy to confuse what default is :)
2010-05-14T18:35:00.000Z	scunizi	IdleOne	as I understand it the dvd offers additional languages and DM's to install. may also have more apps for installation from the cd when needed for those in limited or metered connection areas
