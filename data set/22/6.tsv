2004-11-12T17:18:00.000Z	desp		hello
2004-11-12T17:19:00.000Z	desp		I just installed Ubuntu (Warty Warthog) on an OldWorld PowerMac 7300, and I can't boot from my new ext3 partition
2004-11-12T17:19:00.000Z	desp		I get a kernel panic at startup, because VFS is unable to find the root device
2004-11-12T17:19:00.000Z	mdz	desp	are you sure it's OldWorld?  I'm surprised it got that far
2004-11-12T17:21:00.000Z	desp	mdz	yes, I am sure it's OldWorld. it's not really hard to use BootX, you know
2004-11-12T17:22:00.000Z	desp	mdz	the only thing you need to do to boot on OldWorld is to use BootX, copy the initrd.gz & vmlinux files into some Mac OS partition, and you're set
2004-11-12T17:22:00.000Z	mdz	desp	OldWorld is not supported by Warty
2004-11-12T17:22:00.000Z	desp	mdz	do you have anything else to say besides "not supported"?
2004-11-12T17:23:00.000Z	mdz	desp	nope, sorry.  I don't have any OldWorld systems
2004-11-12T17:23:00.000Z	mdz	desp	and we didn't test on them
2004-11-12T17:25:00.000Z	desp	mdz	the problem is described in detail at http://www.linuxforum.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=71998&st=15
2004-11-12T17:26:00.000Z	mdz	desp	is the right module even being loaded to recognize your SCSI controller?
2004-11-12T17:27:00.000Z	desp	mdz	I assume that it is being loaded, since I managed to format that SCSI disk using the Ubuntu installer while booted from the CD
2004-11-12T17:28:00.000Z	mdz	desp	same kernel, but which initrd?
2004-11-12T17:33:00.000Z	desp	mdz	let me rephrase -- where can I find that initrd that is generated during the install?
2004-11-12T17:46:00.000Z	desp	mdz	thanks for the help, and sorry for being so harsh before
2004-11-19T12:07:00.000Z	mdz	desp	it's generally better to just ask your question; if someone can answer, they'll hear
2004-11-19T12:08:00.000Z	desp	mdz	right. well, whenever I try to open an existing file with vim/gvim, it displays both the beginning and the end of the file, which is rather odd to me, a novice. :P
2004-11-19T12:09:00.000Z	mdz	desp	I've never seen the behaviour you describe
2004-11-19T12:10:00.000Z	desp	mdz	are there any config files used by vim that could've gone bad?
2004-11-19T12:10:00.000Z	mdz	desp	there are config files which could have been changed, but if you leave them alone they generally don't spoil ;-)
2004-11-19T12:17:00.000Z	desp	mdz	it's the folds mechanism automatically applying to all my LaTeX documents I was trying to edit
