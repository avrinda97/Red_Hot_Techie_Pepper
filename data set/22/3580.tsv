2009-02-08T02:49:00.000Z	Gnea	Jan|	the same way you install it to an IDE
2009-02-08T02:51:00.000Z	Jan|	Gnea	how do I know if VIA VT8237 is supported?
2009-02-08T02:52:00.000Z	Gnea	Jan|	what is that? a SATA controller?
2009-02-08T02:52:00.000Z	Gnea	Jan|	is that an Asus A8V motherboard?
2009-02-08T02:55:00.000Z	Jan|	Gnea	yes it's an ASUS A8V Deluxe
2009-02-08T02:57:00.000Z	Jan|	Gnea	yes it's an ASUS A8V Deluxe

2009-02-08T02:59:00.000Z	Gnea	Jan|	please, no dcc chat
2009-02-08T03:00:00.000Z	Jan|	Gnea	Ive got an ASUS A8V Deluxe yes
2009-02-08T03:01:00.000Z	Gnea	Jan|	no need to repeat yourself. have you tried installing it yet?
2009-02-08T03:01:00.000Z	Jan|	Gnea	yes it would not work
2009-02-08T03:01:00.000Z	Gnea	Jan|	that's a bit too vague. any chance of clearing it up?
2009-02-08T03:01:00.000Z	Jan|	Gnea	however if I tried to install debian it worked..
2009-02-08T03:03:00.000Z	Gnea	Jan|	it would be helpful if you could shed light on the exact problem(s) you ran into - simply stating that the sata controller was the problem doesn't say anything. do you have any evidence to back it up? any dmesg errors?
2009-02-08T03:05:00.000Z	Jan|	Gnea	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=885712
2009-02-08T03:08:00.000Z	Gnea	Jan|	wow, so that happened last summer... have you tried 8.10?
2009-02-08T03:09:00.000Z	Jan|	Gnea	not yet
2009-02-08T03:09:00.000Z	Gnea	Jan|	it has a newer kernel, you should try it out
2009-02-08T03:09:00.000Z	Jan|	Gnea	like I said debian worked fine and I find this weird since ubuntu is based on it
2009-02-08T03:10:00.000Z	Jan|	Gnea	yeah will keep in mind to try it out
2009-02-08T03:11:00.000Z	Gnea	Jan|	perhaps you've misunderstood what 'based on' actually means - yes, ubuntu uses the same package management system, but the packages, while some of them are rebranded from debian, are sourcefully different. therefore, ubuntu is not debian and different results are to be expected.
