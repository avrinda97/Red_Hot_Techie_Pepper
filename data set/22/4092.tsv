2008-11-09T15:10:00.000Z	Yuji1	bazhang	Wouldn't happen to know how to resolve Nvidia failing at every startup from the upgrade from 8.04 to 8.10 would you?
2008-11-09T15:10:00.000Z	bazhang	Yuji1	which card and what version of ubuntu, which drivers and how installed
2008-11-09T15:11:00.000Z	bazhang	Yuji1	did you check release notes?
2008-11-09T15:12:00.000Z	Yuji1	bazhang	I read about Nvidia drivers being leaned towards a free open-source instead of those proprietaries, but I prefer the proprietaries...
2008-11-09T15:13:00.000Z	Yuji1	bazhang	I do not want to use the new ones..Nothing has worked any way. :(
2008-11-09T15:13:00.000Z	bazhang	Yuji1	not sure about that card sorry
2008-11-09T15:14:00.000Z	Yuji1	bazhang	Its any card. I've tried several.
2008-11-09T15:14:00.000Z	bazhang	Yuji1	the 7300 works flawlessly here
2008-11-09T15:14:00.000Z	bazhang	Yuji1	doubtful
2008-11-09T15:20:00.000Z	Yuji1	bazhang	Do you think a full fresh install would resolve this issue? ...I've so much on this installation, settings I mean.
2008-11-09T15:20:00.000Z	bazhang	Yuji1	does the livecd work okay? what about creating a new user and trying that
2008-11-09T15:38:00.000Z	Yuji1	bazhang	I tried apt-get install nvidia-glx-177 Results:
2008-11-09T15:39:00.000Z	bazhang	Yuji1	this is hardy?
2008-11-09T15:39:00.000Z	bazhang	Yuji1	what is with that kernel
2008-11-09T15:40:00.000Z	bazhang	Yuji1	what does uname -a show
2008-11-09T15:46:00.000Z	bazhang	Yuji1	having a current kernel will do that :)
2008-11-09T15:47:00.000Z	Yuji1	bazhang	But then desktop effects aren't enabled..
2008-11-09T15:47:00.000Z	bazhang	Yuji1	why not use compiz-decorator
2008-11-09T15:48:00.000Z	bazhang	Yuji1	emerald is fairly flawed imo
2008-11-09T15:48:00.000Z	Yuji1	bazhang	Well it doesn't flaw for how it used to work...
2008-11-09T15:58:00.000Z	Yuji1	bazhang	uname -a still shows 2.6.24-19-generic.
