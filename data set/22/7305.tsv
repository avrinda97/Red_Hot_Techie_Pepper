2010-03-18T18:23:00.000Z	cajun		I have a dual boot system with Ubuntu Karmic and XP. My HDD has 3 partitions. For some reason the 3rd partition requires a root password  but the XP one doesn't. I did not set this up but I want that 3rd partition to automount on startup. How do I do this?
2010-03-18T18:24:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	 did you by chance try to install ubuntu ...something went wrong and you reinstalled from the live cd?
2010-03-18T18:25:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	 ok and when you put in your password can you mount that partition?
2010-03-18T18:26:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	 ok and is this an ntfs partition?
2010-03-18T18:27:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	 here is one soluton  http://maketecheasier.com/auto-mount-your-ntfs-partition-in-ubuntu/2009/04/14   however ...I would research this just abit before attempting it  just in case
2010-03-18T18:28:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	 I am testing that now so hold on
2010-03-18T18:29:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	 well I also have dual boot with 2 ntfs partitions under windows...however neither of them auto mount  and i dont want them to  but  it is possible
2010-03-18T18:29:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	 that particular application mentioned on that  link I gave you seems to work
2010-03-18T18:32:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	 that one I am not sure of...i might have to actually see what is going on with your system to give a decent answer :)
2010-03-18T18:37:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	 ah its fat32   now I see
2010-03-18T18:39:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	 well then since that is fat32 i am not sure that little application would work for you
2010-03-18T18:41:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	 ok just one bit of info   type    coz  then hit the tab button to complete my nick  this way I will be informed on the irc client that someone is speaking with me :)
2010-03-18T18:41:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	  you should practice that with each person you talk with :)
2010-03-18T18:43:00.000Z	cajun	coz_	using the tab sure beats remembering which command alerts the recipient.
2010-03-18T18:43:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	  yeah  its difficutlt to keep track of who is talking to whom without nick complettion
2010-03-18T18:43:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	 :)
2010-03-18T18:44:00.000Z	cajun	coz_	someone should fix the bot so the instructions are more clear for newbies.
2010-03-18T18:44:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	 i also have xchat alert me with a sound if I am not looking at the screen..something I used to hate but found useful especially on support days :)
2010-03-18T18:45:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	 well sometimes..as in this channel ..there are so many of the bot offerings I cant keep track of them myself
2010-03-18T18:46:00.000Z	cajun	coz_	i hear ya. it's hard for me to keep track myself sometimes.
2010-03-18T18:48:00.000Z	cajun	coz_	paranoid_pedlar : thank you so much for you help. have a great day.
2010-03-18T18:48:00.000Z	coz_	cajun	 no problem
