2007-05-04T08:08:00.000Z	mat1980	triex	there are 2 applets, one for monitoring the battery and one for control the cpu speed.
2007-05-04T08:11:00.000Z	triex	mat1980	i think my laptop may not be supported
2007-05-04T08:11:00.000Z	mat1980	triex	go to directory /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0 and tell what is in there
2007-05-04T08:13:00.000Z	triex	mat1980	folders: cpufreq and topology + crash notes
2007-05-04T08:14:00.000Z	mat1980	triex	go into cpufreq and list what there is in, please
2007-05-04T08:17:00.000Z	triex	mat1980	a lot of things, folders: ondemand and stats, then affected_cpus, cpuinfo_cur_freq (there's an X in the corner), cpuinfo_max_freq, cpuinfo_min_freq, scaling_available_frequencies, scaling_available_governors, scaling_cur_freq, scaling_driver, scaling_governor, scaling_max_freq, and scaling_min_freq
2007-05-04T08:17:00.000Z	triex	mat1980	quite an exhaustive list
2007-05-04T08:18:00.000Z	mat1980	triex	thanks, sorry but I'm working on a desktop, and my laptop is at home :) well... go on...
2007-05-04T08:18:00.000Z	mat1980	triex	give me what is the content of scaling_available_frequencies
2007-05-04T08:19:00.000Z	triex	mat1980	says it could not open it
2007-05-04T08:21:00.000Z	mat1980	triex	open a terminal and give the command     cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies
2007-05-04T08:21:00.000Z	mat1980	triex	the command is without new lines, sorry
2007-05-04T08:21:00.000Z	triex	mat1980	how do i open a terminal?
2007-05-04T08:22:00.000Z	mat1980	triex	application->accessories->console
2007-05-04T08:24:00.000Z	triex	mat1980	no such file
