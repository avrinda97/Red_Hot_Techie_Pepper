2010-03-13T00:13:00.000Z	theadmin	richthegeek	Oh, uninstall? Since when?
2010-03-13T00:13:00.000Z	richthegeek	theadmin	sorry, I got confused.. I have two .bashrc aliases for "install" and "uninstall"
2010-03-13T00:14:00.000Z	theadmin	richthegeek	Hm, i just have an alias for "sudo apt-get" (it's "apt")
2010-03-13T00:14:00.000Z	richthegeek	theadmin	that also works but I rarely do anything other than install/remove
2010-03-13T00:31:00.000Z	theadmin	richthegeek	Spaces are important, or else apt-get will pass that semicolon in package name and... epic fail
2010-03-13T00:32:00.000Z	richthegeek	theadmin	really? I thought the ; was a syntax char in bash and would recognise it as such
2010-03-13T00:32:00.000Z	theadmin	richthegeek	Well, apt-get is kinda stupid sometimes
2010-03-13T00:32:00.000Z	richthegeek	theadmin	nope, that command worked fine. Bash is cleverer than you give it credit for
2010-03-13T00:33:00.000Z	theadmin	richthegeek	Hem, it didn't work on Mint. Weird.
2010-03-13T00:33:00.000Z	richthegeek	theadmin	might use a different terminal emulator by default
2010-03-13T00:34:00.000Z	theadmin	richthegeek	Modified gnome-terminal. Nevertheless, it still is bash.
2010-03-13T00:34:00.000Z	richthegeek	theadmin	maybe apt has been patched then
2010-03-13T00:45:00.000Z	theadmin	richthegeek	sudo caches the password for 5 minutes or so
2010-03-13T00:46:00.000Z	richthegeek	theadmin	yes, it asked me for the password so it required auth
2010-03-13T00:48:00.000Z	richthegeek	theadmin	you could bind one to a bash script if you wanted
2010-03-13T00:54:00.000Z	richthegeek	theadmin	it's a bash fork attack
2010-05-17T19:39:00.000Z	theadmin	richthegeek	We can't help with hacking.
2010-05-17T19:40:00.000Z	richthegeek	theadmin	not hacking, educational purposes
2010-05-17T19:40:00.000Z	richthegeek	theadmin	that is, it's not a commercial file or anything, just a friend wanted to see if I could and gave me a few clues for what hte password might be (names of classmates etc)
2010-05-17T19:41:00.000Z	theadmin	richthegeek	However, I suppose that "for p in 'cat passwordlist.file' ; do unrar -p $p ; done" (or something. I don't remember how you specify a password for unrar. But I guess that'd work)
2010-05-17T19:41:00.000Z	richthegeek	theadmin	ok - will it return a non-zero value if the password is incorrect?
2010-05-17T19:49:00.000Z	richthegeek	theadmin	acicula: thanks, got a loop running on it now, checking for the return $? ostensibly but mostly keeping an eye out for a value that didn't say "CRC failed"... bleedin challenges. Time to break out the sha1 in revenge!
