2008-11-22T11:49:00.000Z	ziroday	Ratchet--	great! Have fun
2008-11-22T11:39:00.000Z	ziroday	Ratchet--	take a look at avant-window-navigator
2008-11-22T11:40:00.000Z	Ratchet--	ziroday	 I am very new to Ubuntu. Life isn't as simple as that. Where is this at?
2008-11-22T11:40:00.000Z	ziroday	Ratchet--	sure, you can install the package from the repos
2008-11-22T11:41:00.000Z	Ratchet--	ziroday	I don't understand. I am looking for instructions on getting Kxdocker, as the instructions are unclear.
2008-11-22T11:41:00.000Z	ziroday	Ratchet--	so you want kxdocker as a dock or avant-window-navigator (awn) as a dock?
2008-11-22T11:41:00.000Z	Ratchet--	ziroday	KxDocker.
2008-11-22T11:42:00.000Z	ziroday	Ratchet--	are you using kde?
2008-11-22T11:42:00.000Z	Ratchet--	ziroday	Grub Ubuntu.
2008-11-22T11:42:00.000Z	Ratchet--	ziroday	Not sure what KDE is, and whether or not I got it.
2008-11-22T11:43:00.000Z	ziroday	Ratchet--	okay, I'll take that as Ubuntu (Gnome) instead of Kubuntu (KDE)
2008-11-22T11:43:00.000Z	Ratchet--	ziroday	 Yes, Gnome.
2008-11-22T11:43:00.000Z	ziroday	Ratchet--	which guide are you following currently?
2008-11-22T11:44:00.000Z	Ratchet--	ziroday	 Well, there's none on the website, which is why I got confused. I can download the source from the website, but I am unable to compile due to lack of help.
2008-11-22T11:45:00.000Z	ziroday	Ratchet--	okay, kxdocker doesn't appear to be in the repositories, futhermore its designed with KDE in mind, not Gnome. I strongly you recommend you use avant-window-navigator instead
2008-11-22T11:46:00.000Z	Ratchet--	ziroday	Hmkay. I'll try that. How I get it?
2008-11-22T11:46:00.000Z	ziroday	Ratchet--	you know how to install applications on ubunut?
2008-11-22T11:46:00.000Z	Ratchet--	ziroday	a) Add/Remove programs list. b) sudo apt-get install <package>
2008-11-22T11:46:00.000Z	Ratchet--	ziroday	all I know.
2008-11-22T11:47:00.000Z	ziroday	Ratchet--	okay thats fine, the package name is avant-window-navigator. So you can install it with sudo apt-get install avant-window-navigator
2008-11-22T11:47:00.000Z	Ratchet--	ziroday	 okay, let me try.
2008-11-22T11:49:00.000Z	Ratchet--	ziroday	thanks for your time and help. it worked. <3
