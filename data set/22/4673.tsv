2007-12-03T15:39:00.000Z	LeenuxRawksAll		big problems here...
2007-12-03T15:40:00.000Z	LeenuxRawksAll		I had 2 different ubuntu installs on my machine, one on sda1 and sda 3, well I deleted the one on sda3 and now I can't boot my primary partition, even after Re-installing ubuntu to the second partition
2007-12-03T15:41:00.000Z	LeenuxRawksAll		yes of course
2007-12-03T15:42:00.000Z	LeenuxRawksAll		basically, grub isn't seeing the other, older install
2007-12-03T15:44:00.000Z	dgjones	LeenuxRawksAll	are you abe to mount sda1 from within your fresh install to check what is in the first install's fstab? Possibly you just need to copy that info over into the fstab for the new install
2007-12-03T15:44:00.000Z	LeenuxRawksAll	dgjones	I try to open it and all I get is a "Lost and Found" folder...
2007-12-03T15:47:00.000Z	dgjones	LeenuxRawksAll	i'm not sure whats happened, but it sounds as though its been formatted if thats all thats left, can you tell how much free space and what size the partition was originally?
2007-12-03T15:47:00.000Z	LeenuxRawksAll		total capacity is 25gb with only 1.5 used
2007-12-03T15:48:00.000Z	LeenuxRawksAll		on sda1
2007-12-03T15:48:00.000Z	LeenuxRawksAll		I tried to Chown but it kept giving me "invalid user" errors...
2007-12-03T15:48:00.000Z	LeenuxRawksAll		It's still there... it's just not seeing it...
2007-12-03T15:49:00.000Z	dgjones	LeenuxRawksAll	1.5Gb seems low for an install of ubuntu though, thats what made me think it might have been formatted, is it the same format type ext3 etc as the new install
2007-12-03T15:49:00.000Z	LeenuxRawksAll		sda1 is ext3 and the new one is ext2
2007-12-03T15:49:00.000Z	LeenuxRawksAll		think that might be it?
2007-12-03T15:51:00.000Z	LeenuxRawksAll		see, I've had sda1 installed for months... and I created another partition with gparted and did another install of ubuntu on it, but decided to delete that new install, and for some reason, the old grub didn't click in to boot the system...
2007-12-03T15:52:00.000Z	LeenuxRawksAll		when I installed ubuntu on sda3 last time, it picked it right up...isn't there a way that I can add grub back to sda1?
2007-12-03T15:52:00.000Z	dgjones	LeenuxRawksAll	when I've had multiple installations, the grub that was used was the most recent one, so presumably deleting the original grub
2007-12-03T15:52:00.000Z	dgjones		!grub | LeenuxRawksAll, You could try this and see if it can redect your original install and
2007-12-03T15:53:00.000Z	LeenuxRawksAll		will do... I'll report back with progress
2007-12-03T15:53:00.000Z	LeenuxRawksAll		Thank you!
2007-12-03T15:53:00.000Z	dgjones	LeenuxRawksAll	Good luck, hope it works for you
