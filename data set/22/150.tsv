2012-05-20T13:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		hi miss_ubuntu
2012-05-20T13:40:00.000Z	miss_ubuntu	ActionParsnip	what tool do u use for searching only in filenames?
2012-05-20T13:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miss_ubuntu	locate
2012-05-20T13:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miss_ubuntu	you'll need to run:  sudo updatedb   first
2012-05-20T13:41:00.000Z	miss_ubuntu	ActionParsnip	locate is not as good as Everything.exe in windows
2012-05-20T13:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miss_ubuntu	how, updatedb makes a database of the files, so the search is instantaneous
2012-05-20T13:44:00.000Z	miss_ubuntu	ActionParsnip	can we customize locate to search only in particular directory?
2012-05-20T13:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miss_ubuntu	it's like searching a text file, its that fast, you can also grep the output and run commands on the output which windows can't do natively
2012-05-20T13:44:00.000Z	miss_ubuntu	ActionParsnip	can we customize locate to INDEX only in particular directory?
2012-05-20T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miss_ubuntu	to search a particular directory you'd need to grep, the database is ALL files
2012-05-20T13:45:00.000Z	miss_ubuntu	ActionParsnip	i wish u have used Everything.exe
2012-05-20T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miss_ubuntu	locate is a lot more powerful due to text streams in UNIX
2012-05-20T13:48:00.000Z	miss_ubuntu	ActionParsnip	how do u run updatedb instantaneously updated whenever a new file is created?
2012-05-20T13:48:00.000Z	miss_ubuntu	ActionParsnip	thanks for the help by the way
2012-05-20T13:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miss_ubuntu	you could cron a job
2012-05-20T13:49:00.000Z	miss_ubuntu	ActionParsnip	and fasta bundle of thnaks
2012-05-20T13:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miss_ubuntu	+1
2012-05-20T13:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miss_ubuntu	tried virtualbox?
2012-05-20T13:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miss_ubuntu	its different, try it
2012-05-20T13:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miss_ubuntu	try setting fewer resources to the guest OS
2012-05-26T14:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miss_ubuntu	does:  sudo shutdown -h now     shut it down?
