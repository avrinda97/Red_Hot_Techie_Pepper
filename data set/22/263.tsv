2012-02-19T22:11:00.000Z	craynerd		Hello, I`m a noob to ubuntu and I`ve been pleased so far. I`ve just purchased a Addon Wireless usb adapter that comes with a folder saying "linux drivers" and a readme. The readme makes NO sense and I`m not clear how to install it. Anyone give me a hand?
2012-02-19T22:12:00.000Z	mneptok	craynerd	forget the CD. just plug in the adpater.
2012-02-19T22:13:00.000Z	mneptok	craynerd	the driver may be in the kernel already. just try using the device.
2012-02-19T22:17:00.000Z	mneptok	craynerd	if the kernel module exists, it may not be loaded. if you don't kow the name of the module, the best course is to boot the machine with the adapter attached.
2012-02-19T22:20:00.000Z	mneptok	craynerd	the adapter will need to be plugged in while running this tool
2012-02-19T22:21:00.000Z	craynerd	mneptok	yes addapter is in.
2012-02-19T22:30:00.000Z	mneptok	craynerd	pastebin the output of "lsusb -vv"
2012-02-19T22:32:00.000Z	craynerd	mneptok	I`m going to struggle! I`ve just done as you asked but with no network, I can`t get to pastebin..
2012-02-19T22:32:00.000Z	craynerd	mneptok	bear with me, I`ll try and copy to memory stick and move it to this computer.
2012-02-19T22:37:00.000Z	craynerd	mneptok	http://pastebin.com/5NEmjv0Y
2012-02-19T22:37:00.000Z	craynerd	mneptok	the initial lssub is there... the Addon is listed as Realtek..
2012-02-19T22:39:00.000Z	mneptok	craynerd	that's a Realtek 8176 chipset you are using.
2012-02-19T22:41:00.000Z	mneptok	craynerd	but it's Realtek, as you see. have you tried booting the machine with the adapter attached?
2012-02-19T22:41:00.000Z	craynerd	mneptok	- it is definately that, as I`ve pulled it out and done the lsusb and it vanishes
2012-02-19T22:41:00.000Z	craynerd	mneptok	- could it be because this ubuntu is stripped down (I believe it is stripped down but it might not be!!)
2012-02-19T22:42:00.000Z	mneptok	craynerd	it's a matter of what kernel modules you have by default. unless someone stripped the kernel, i'll stand by my "boot with it attached" advice.
2012-02-19T22:43:00.000Z	craynerd	mneptok	I`ve had it in and booted many time...
2012-02-19T22:44:00.000Z	mneptok	craynerd	no, hopefully.
2012-02-19T22:44:00.000Z	craynerd	mneptok	in that case, I do appreciate your advice. But it doesn`t work when booted with it plugged in.
2012-02-19T22:46:00.000Z	craynerd	mneptok	have you any other suggestions. It is Ubuntu 10:04
2012-02-19T22:46:00.000Z	mneptok	craynerd	update and get a newer kernel that probably supports this chipset.
2012-02-19T22:48:00.000Z	mneptok	craynerd	then create a build environment and go through compiling your own module from the source code you have on that CD. or choose another adapter.
