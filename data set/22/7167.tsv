2006-06-22T14:57:00.000Z	mnk		where r the compiled kernel modles?
2006-06-22T14:58:00.000Z	mnk		all u guys r too busy for me :(
2006-06-22T14:58:00.000Z	P0ldy	mnk	are you trying to install via APT/synaptic?
2006-06-22T15:00:00.000Z	P0ldy	mnk	why?  There are free programs to do that that you can get without compiling
2006-06-22T15:00:00.000Z	mnk	P0ldy	yeah but i heard they r all unstable
2006-06-22T15:01:00.000Z	P0ldy	mnk	I wouldn't trust a product just because someone is selling it.  I've heard they're not *that* unstable.  Let me find you the howto...
2006-06-22T15:01:00.000Z	mnk	P0ldy	i did try it and i couldn't delete files that were created by windows!!!!! it kept saying file not found
2006-06-22T15:02:00.000Z	P0ldy	mnk	honestly, ANY ntfs writing on Linux is going to be risky because MS hasn't released the spec.  You take a chance either way.
2006-06-22T15:03:00.000Z	P0ldy	mnk	read through this thread : http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=142481
2006-06-22T15:03:00.000Z	mnk	P0ldy	yeah but that didn't work for me - whereas the bootable disk that paragon gave as a trial did work
2006-06-22T15:04:00.000Z	mnk	P0ldy	yeah that's the howto i tried
2006-06-22T15:04:00.000Z	mnk	P0ldy	btw thanks for ur help - i appreciate it
2006-06-22T15:04:00.000Z	mnk	P0ldy	 the thing is when i did that howto, it mounted ok, but the blasted thing wouldn't delete any files previously created by windows - it keps saying no such file or dir
2006-06-22T15:06:00.000Z	P0ldy	mnk	well, I'd post your problems there if you haven't.  There aren't many on Linux who will use paid software for ntfs and thus not many who can help you.  The short of it is that your issue is a dependency problem, and since you're compiling the paragon program doesn't come with the right dependencies (nor would you really want to install them -- it looks like it's requiring an older kernel version than you probably have)
