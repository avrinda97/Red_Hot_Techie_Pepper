2009-05-11T01:14:00.000Z	AustinS		MADE IT!  Gah people ask like linux is a breeze these days.  I will say it is 10000x better then before.
2009-05-11T01:16:00.000Z	AustinS		can you install Adobe Air using Apt-get or synaptic?  I can't find the package.  Am I missing a repository?
2009-05-11T01:16:00.000Z	Gho	AustinS	really?  I FF/RW in VLC frquently
2009-05-11T01:16:00.000Z	AustinS	Gho	How?  I want to drag a slider, not use ctrl+forward
2009-05-11T01:17:00.000Z	Gho	AustinS	fullscreen or windowed?
2009-05-11T01:18:00.000Z	Gho	AustinS	when fullscreen, I get a draggable 'progress bar' for a video onscreen.  When windowed, there's one in the main VLC window.
2009-05-11T01:19:00.000Z	AustinS	Gho	Even on embedded wmp videos in Firefox?
2009-05-11T01:19:00.000Z	Gho	AustinS	AH, that's the part I missed.  I don't watch a lot of embedded media
2009-05-11T01:22:00.000Z	Gho	AustinS	try ~/Desktop/AdobeAirInstaller.bin
2009-05-11T01:25:00.000Z	Gho	AustinS	I believe so..  what hhp2k1 said :)
2009-05-11T01:31:00.000Z	Gho	AustinS	/op1 or /opt?
2009-05-11T01:31:00.000Z	AustinS	Gho	let me copy and paste, tiny weird font
2009-05-11T01:31:00.000Z	AustinS	Gho	"/opt"
2009-05-11T01:32:00.000Z	Gho	AustinS	/opt is.. infrequently used, but it's not unheard of.
2009-05-11T01:32:00.000Z	AustinS	Gho	where are apps normally /bin or something?
2009-05-11T01:32:00.000Z	AustinS	Gho	usr/bin maybe?
2009-05-11T01:33:00.000Z	Gho	AustinS	most things end up under /usr or /usr/local, some some use /opt  (optional software) as some older UNIX systems didn't have /usr/local
2009-05-11T01:33:00.000Z	Gho	AustinS	it's a legacy thing
2009-05-11T01:38:00.000Z	Gho	AustinS	alt-shift-arrow
2009-05-11T01:39:00.000Z	Gho	AustinS	correctuon- ctrl-alt-shift-arrow
2009-05-11T01:39:00.000Z	AustinS	Gho	 there it goes :)
2009-05-11T01:57:00.000Z	Gho	AustinS	look into ufw and gufw
