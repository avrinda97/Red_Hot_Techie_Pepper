2007-03-19T14:36:00.000Z	Oswy		If the memtest fails, do I have a much bigger problem on my hands?
2007-03-19T14:36:00.000Z	Oswy		Haha.
2007-03-19T14:36:00.000Z	Oswy		Fair enough.

2007-03-19T14:31:00.000Z	eV_64	Oswy	why couldn't you boot to cd?
2007-03-19T14:33:00.000Z	eV_64	Oswy	run memtest?
2007-03-19T14:33:00.000Z	eV_64	Oswy	if they have it
2007-03-19T14:33:00.000Z	eV_64	Oswy	you boot to it
2007-03-19T14:34:00.000Z	eV_64	Oswy	do you remember it being an option?
