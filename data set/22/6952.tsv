2007-08-30T10:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo1	Have you bothered to read them..?
2007-08-30T10:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo1	How far do you get.. If you exhibit some knowledge that you treid, people are more willing to help.
2007-08-30T12:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo1	If you read the instructions... where did you stop or NOT understand them.  They are no different than the instructions we would type in manually here.
2007-08-30T12:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo1	NOT easier for us..
2007-08-30T12:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo1	You have shown NO interest in fixing it per the instructions we took a lot of time to write out.
2007-08-30T12:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo1	Nvidia are very easy... but there are many cards... it isnt hard... just read the instructions... and ask a question when you dont understand one of the things they tell you to do.
2007-08-30T12:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo1	You have been told that for several hours... if you get stuck, ask a well formed question about what you cant figure out
2007-08-30T12:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo1	Start with the one I just linked here... find your card maker then the chipset...  You need to do some reading.
2007-08-30T12:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo1	Yes I did...   Sorry but I dont have time to help you...
2007-08-30T12:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo1	What version of Ubuntu are you using
2007-08-30T12:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo1	You dont know what you installed?
2007-08-30T12:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo1	Type in a terminal                     lsb_release -a
2007-08-30T12:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo1	You will see you are using feisty...
2007-08-30T12:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo1	If you went to this page   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto  and selected nvidia.. It takes you to this page  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia   You are using 7.04 and the instructions are right there... I have no idea where you are getting that other info you pasted...
