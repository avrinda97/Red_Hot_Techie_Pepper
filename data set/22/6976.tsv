2006-06-14T13:11:00.000Z	Tommy2k4		another problem with the installer is that when defining the partitions, if you click on create after creating another one without first clicking on the the free space partition the installer will go blank and you have to go back and start the partitioning again
2006-06-14T13:12:00.000Z	Tommy2k4		is it possible repartition my drive from inside ubuntu

2006-06-14T13:38:00.000Z	Tommy2k4	count	 is there no simple way to just do it by pc name like i can in windows
2006-06-14T13:40:00.000Z	count	Tommy2k4	yeah, you can use netbios names if you have that installed on the windows machine
2006-06-14T13:40:00.000Z	count	Tommy2k4	it HIGHLY depends on your environment and setup on linux ANd windows
2006-06-14T13:42:00.000Z	Tommy2k4	count	i just used standard windows file sharing i dunno if that would be using netbios or not

2006-06-14T13:43:00.000Z	count	Tommy2k4	without a WINS server or dynamic dns it's not going to be reliable though
