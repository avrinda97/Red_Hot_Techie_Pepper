2005-07-10T10:10:00.000Z	freddy	SQFreak	USB ipod
2005-07-10T10:12:00.000Z	SQFreak	freddy	i'd imagine that's a little easier than a 1394 one (which is what I have...but only sync in Windows so I don't know how it goes in Ubuntu. Ubuntu detects an OHCI IEEE1394 controller, so I can't imagine it'd be that hard)
2005-07-10T10:13:00.000Z	freddy	SQFreak	damn im sorry man
2005-07-10T10:13:00.000Z	SQFreak	freddy	sorry about what?
2005-07-10T10:14:00.000Z	SQFreak	freddy	there's no problem. I can't test it now because I lost my 6-pin to 4-pin 1394 adapter, otherwise i'd test it.
2005-07-10T10:15:00.000Z	freddy	SQFreak	ah ok
2005-07-10T10:25:00.000Z	SQFreak	freddy	no, arentie was answering yes to installing XP on VMWare, no to freeness.

2005-07-10T11:02:00.000Z	SQFreak	freddy	I've still got my Hauppauge lying around somewhere. It's old and pretty crappy...
2005-07-10T11:07:00.000Z	SQFreak	freddy	can you lspci and tell me what it says about your TV Tuner Card?
2005-07-10T11:08:00.000Z	freddy	SQFreak	0000:06:01.0 Multimedia video controller: Brooktree Corporation Bt878 Video Capture (rev 11)
2005-07-10T11:12:00.000Z	SQFreak	freddy	that's odd. My WinTV Go was a BT878 and I had no problems. Is the module for it in your kernel?

2005-07-10T11:14:00.000Z	SQFreak	freddy	the color was a tad off, so I had to adjust it a little.
