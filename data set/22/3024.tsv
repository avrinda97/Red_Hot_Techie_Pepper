2009-01-20T08:16:00.000Z	thread		anybody have any idea why my video in, say, totem-gstreamer might be stretched vertically?
2009-01-20T08:16:00.000Z	thread		example: http://threadbox.net/broke-gstreamer.png
2009-01-20T08:18:00.000Z	miranda_psi	thread	its probably misreading the video aspect or the video file has incorrect aspect ratio
2009-01-20T08:18:00.000Z	thread	miranda_psi	the video file is fine. I can play them back fine in x11 mode
2009-01-20T08:18:00.000Z	thread		but the performance is terrible
2009-01-20T08:19:00.000Z	thread		where is the aspect ratio configured (that ... i guess gstreamer is gonna read from)
2009-01-20T08:21:00.000Z	miranda_psi	thread	what do you mean its fine in x11 mode?
2009-01-20T08:21:00.000Z	thread	miranda_psi	gstreamer-properties ... i was able to configure the gstreamer video driver there
2009-01-20T08:22:00.000Z	miranda_psi	thread	that is just the driver that gstreamer uses to output the video (it shouldn't affect the video ratio)
2009-01-20T08:22:00.000Z	thread	miranda_psi	well it does.
2009-01-20T08:22:00.000Z	miranda_psi	thread	what driver where you having problems with?
2009-01-20T08:23:00.000Z	thread	miranda_psi	Xv. it makes the video nice and smooth.
2009-01-20T08:25:00.000Z	miranda_psi	thread	yes xv is more efficient than the x11 driver - do you get the same problem with other players (e.g. mplayer)
2009-01-20T08:25:00.000Z	thread	miranda_psi	yeah, I get the same issue in miro as it employs gstreamer... mplayer works fine, though
2009-01-20T08:26:00.000Z	miranda_psi	thread	using xv in mplayer?
2009-01-20T08:26:00.000Z	miranda_psi		!ask
2009-01-20T08:27:00.000Z	thread	miranda_psi	yeah, actually... it is the xv driver that is working fine for mplayer
2009-01-20T08:28:00.000Z	miranda_psi	thread	then its probably a problem with the way gstreamer is talking to the xv driver - if you want to use the xv driver with totem you could try totem-xine
2009-01-20T08:30:00.000Z	thread	miranda_psi	yeah, xine is an option... i'd sorta rather just figure out what's wrong with gstreamer tho
2009-01-20T08:30:00.000Z	thread	miranda_psi	we'll try at this a little longer ;) thanks anyway
2009-01-20T08:32:00.000Z	miranda_psi	thread	maybe try the gstreamer channel (/join #gstreamer)
2009-01-20T08:32:00.000Z	thread	miranda_psi	i asked there first :)
