2009-08-29T03:54:00.000Z	teadict		Is there a trick so links run by default instead of asking for one of those 4 options?
2009-08-29T03:56:00.000Z	bucky	teadict	irssi will start with no options
2009-08-29T03:56:00.000Z	teadict	bucky	How does that solve my problme?
2009-08-29T03:56:00.000Z	bucky	teadict	but there's prolly a .links file that you can store defaults
2009-08-29T03:57:00.000Z	teadict	bucky	Where?
2009-08-29T03:59:00.000Z	teadict	bucky	Ubuntu keeps a .links file for default configuration of links?
2009-08-29T04:00:00.000Z	bucky	teadict	most user apps do have a similar file i would just assume
2009-08-29T04:02:00.000Z	bucky	teadict	i found a user's manual http://links.sourceforge.net/docs/manual-0.82-en/
2009-08-29T04:02:00.000Z	teadict	bucky	I'll give it a check
2009-08-29T04:03:00.000Z	teadict	bucky	Oh lawd.. Hehe.. Not links the application for text-based web browsing.. Just links.. As in make a link to an executable file and make it Run by default (I want to avoid that pop-up question: [Run in terminal] [Edit] [Cancel] [Run])
2009-08-29T04:05:00.000Z	bucky	teadict	is the file executable?
2009-08-29T04:05:00.000Z	teadict	bucky	Yes.. I've never known when Ubuntu asks for the action...
2009-08-29T04:06:00.000Z	bucky	teadict	how are you running it? by clicking on it?
2009-08-29T04:07:00.000Z	teadict	bucky	Made the executable file, and made a link, normal procedure. Double clicking pops up the question
2009-08-29T04:08:00.000Z	bucky	teadict	did you make a launcher on the desktop? and that's what your clicking?
2009-08-29T04:08:00.000Z	teadict	bucky	Yeap
2009-08-29T04:08:00.000Z	bucky	teadict	you made a link with ln -s ?
2009-08-29T04:09:00.000Z	teadict	bucky	No, graphically interfacing
2009-08-29T04:09:00.000Z	bucky	teadict	with a path directly to the exectuable?
2009-08-29T04:10:00.000Z	teadict	bucky	Yes..
2009-08-29T04:21:00.000Z	bucky	teadict	i can't reproduce the problem, i don't get that pop up box.. tho i have heard of this in this channel before
2009-08-29T04:23:00.000Z	teadict	bucky	No problemo. It won't kill me. Ty
