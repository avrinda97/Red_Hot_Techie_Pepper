2010-05-24T20:44:00.000Z	akincer		Tyring to install sun-java6-jdk and I'm not having any luck. already enabled the partner repositories in sources and I I get this error message in Synaptic: Package sun-java6-jdk has no available version, but exists in the database. This typically means that the package was mentioned in a dependency and never uploaded, has been obsoleted or is not available with the contents of sources.list
2010-05-24T20:46:00.000Z	akincer		Let me ask it another way -- HOW do I install sun-java6.jdk on 10.04?
2010-05-24T20:47:00.000Z	akincer		err, sun-java6-jdk rather
2010-05-24T20:47:00.000Z	trism	akincer	you need to add the partner repository
2010-05-24T20:47:00.000Z	akincer	trism	already did that. doesn't work
2010-05-24T20:48:00.000Z	akincer		I've enabled the partner repositories, updated apt, tried to install from both the CLI and Synaptic. Both fail

2010-05-24T20:49:00.000Z	akincer		sorry that was synaptic

2010-05-24T20:52:00.000Z	akincer		Replacing the sun jdk with openjdk was a fail. I'm sure there's all sorts of magical reasons for it, but I think that was a bad move
2010-05-24T20:52:00.000Z	akincer		sigh
2010-05-24T20:52:00.000Z	akincer		the partner repositories ARE enabled
2010-05-24T20:53:00.000Z	akincer		Sun dropped support for their jdk? Or do you mean just the Linux version?
2010-05-24T20:54:00.000Z	akincer		10.04
2010-05-24T20:55:00.000Z	trism	akincer	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list

2010-05-24T20:57:00.000Z	trism	akincer	you have karmic partner not lucid
2010-05-24T20:57:00.000Z	trism	akincer	change karmic to lucid in the partner lines and apt-get update; and it will work
2010-05-24T20:58:00.000Z	akincer		LOL
2010-05-24T20:58:00.000Z	akincer		didn't actually read it. just uncommented it
2010-05-24T20:58:00.000Z	akincer		Isn't that special
2010-05-24T20:59:00.000Z	trism	akincer	almost did the same when I tested the install just now, understandable
