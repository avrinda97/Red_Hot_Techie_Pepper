2008-07-23T14:39:00.000Z	sebrock	ActionParsnip	what??
2008-07-23T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sebrock	you should be able to yes
2008-07-23T14:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sebrock	you can always uninstall if its no good
2008-08-19T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sebrock	check your config to make sure nothing point to and cdrom stuff
2008-08-19T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sebrock	or create a symlink to he same files to keep it happy
2008-08-19T16:05:00.000Z	sebrock	ActionParsnip	problem is it still complains about missing drivers for CD-ROm
2011-01-26T23:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sebrock	yes but very not advised
2011-01-26T23:14:00.000Z	sebrock	ActionParsnip	is it not possibel to backport in anyway?
2011-01-26T23:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sebrock	you can install it but it may have newer deps and then they mayneed newer deps and you'll have some weird frankenstien install
2011-01-26T23:15:00.000Z	sebrock	ActionParsnip	well, Lucid has version 2.6.23 and Maverick 2.6.26. I thought LTS meant they create automatic backports?
2011-01-26T23:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sebrock	no, LTS just means it's supported for longer on the official repos
2011-01-26T23:16:00.000Z	sebrock	ActionParsnip	and what is official repos?
2011-01-26T23:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sebrock	the canonical servers you install software from and install updates from
2011-01-26T23:17:00.000Z	sebrock	ActionParsnip	oh, but not updates?
2011-01-26T23:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sebrock	how do you mean?
2011-01-26T23:22:00.000Z	sebrock	ActionParsnip	cant I create a backport myself somehow?
2011-07-12T22:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sebrock	set the BIOS to stop on no errors, may help. I'd ask in ##hardware
2011-07-12T22:10:00.000Z	sebrock	ActionParsnip	I'll try that thanks
