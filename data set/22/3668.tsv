2008-07-07T19:43:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	You could probably just delete the wine folder if you really wanted to
2008-07-07T19:44:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	Well, if that's definitely what you want to do, I guess you could just do rm -rf /home/$USER/.wine/
2008-07-07T19:46:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	if you really want to be sure to get everything you can put sudo in front of the command I gave
2008-07-07T19:46:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	But be very careful, if you type it in wrong you could hose your whole system.
2008-07-07T19:49:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	What happens when you do exactly this. Click Applications -> Accessories -> terminal, then type rm -rf /home/$USER/.wine/
2008-07-07T19:50:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	If you don't want wine anymore, sudo apt-get purge wine
2008-07-07T19:50:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	Nothing is good, that means it erased everything that was in your wine folder successfully. Now if you want to actually uninstall wine completely, you can do sudo apt-get purge wine
2008-07-07T20:01:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	lol, but pidgin has everything aim has plus more?
2008-07-07T20:03:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	If you actually want aim for linux. There's like, an aim 1.5, but it's terribad. You really should use pidgin.
2008-07-07T20:05:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	http://www.aim.com/get_aim/linux/latest_linux.adp there, have fun, it looks like it hasn't been updated in years.
2008-07-07T20:05:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	I just gave you the link. Have fun
2008-07-07T20:10:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	Linux is not Windows. Every question you've asked so far can basically be summed up by that.
2008-07-08T19:29:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	If you "want the option of ubuntu off the loader for windows" that means you want to uninstall ubuntu?
2008-07-10T20:21:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	just run ccsm
2008-07-10T20:21:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	all the compiz effect options are changeable from within there
2008-07-10T20:22:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	Here's exactly what you have to do. click applications ->accessories->terminal, then type sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install compiz-config-settings-manager && ccsm
2008-07-10T20:22:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	then run it. run ccsm.
2008-07-10T20:23:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	I just want you to run ccsm and edit the options in there.
2008-07-10T20:24:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	It's under animations, minimize effect, I believe
2008-07-10T20:27:00.000Z	gam3r111	ASULutzy	i cant find it under minimize effect?
2008-07-10T20:28:00.000Z	ASULutzy	gam3r111	Look harder. run ccsm, click animations, click the minimize animation tab, it's called airplane
