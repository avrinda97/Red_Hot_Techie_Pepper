2009-09-07T11:05:00.000Z	Darkebrz		Where do I find the C:/ Drive while in Ubuntu?
2009-09-07T11:05:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	its not called that in Ubuntu. its just /
2009-09-07T11:06:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	also i think you mean C:\ not C:/
2009-09-07T11:23:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	/dev/sda2 is your windows
2009-09-07T11:24:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	is ubuntu not installed? or is it a wubi install?
2009-09-07T11:19:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	whats the output of "sudo fdisk -l"? can you put it on paste.ubuntu.com ?
2009-09-07T11:22:00.000Z	Darkebrz	maco	Does that help?
2009-09-07T11:24:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	try "sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt"
2009-09-07T11:25:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	that should give you access to it in /mnt
2009-09-07T11:29:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	whats the output of plain old "mount"? does it list /dev/sda2 as already mounted on /mnt?
2009-09-07T11:30:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	if so you should be able to "ls /mnt" and see your windows disk
2009-09-07T11:30:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	ok so its already mounted
2009-09-07T11:31:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	now if you "ls /mnt" you should see the same thing as youd see with "dir C:\" on windows
2009-09-07T11:31:00.000Z	Darkebrz	maco	Yep
2009-09-07T11:34:00.000Z	Darkebrz	maco	Now how can I make it so I can look through that partition? I intended to add some files to Audacious
2009-09-07T11:35:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	um you can copy some files into wubi or you can ...hrm i guess you could setup /etc/fstab to automatically mount /dev/sda2 in a certain spot and tell audacious how to find those files for its library every time you boot
2009-09-07T11:36:00.000Z	Darkebrz	maco	Do you know why this partition is so hidden?
2009-09-07T11:37:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	its not...
2009-09-07T11:37:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	showed up in fdisk just fine
2009-09-07T11:38:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	i dont know how windows hierarchy goes but i imagine music is something like /mnt/Users/Documents and Settings/<your name>/My Documents/My Music/ ?
2009-09-07T11:39:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	O_O i still remembered it?
2009-09-09T04:25:00.000Z	maco	Darkebrz	it asks you
