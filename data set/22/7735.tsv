2006-01-10T09:32:00.000Z	JoeBlow	jenda	in europe it seems to be that they just flood the market with new artists to test of their good or not, and it gets old
2006-01-10T09:33:00.000Z	jenda	JoeBlow	sure, open bottle with corkscrew, and chug.

2006-01-13T08:01:00.000Z	jenda	JoeBlow	It's not an ntfs linux, just support
2006-01-13T08:02:00.000Z	JoeBlow	jenda	yea im aware of that, im just joking, because having any data u wanna use in linux on a ntfs partition is such a pain, i spend half my day messing with the hassle
2006-01-13T08:02:00.000Z	jenda	JoeBlow	Solution: do not use NTFS
2006-01-13T08:02:00.000Z	JoeBlow	jenda	as long as u dont want to play any modern games
