2009-11-25T17:04:00.000Z	wingzero		hi all
2009-11-25T17:04:00.000Z	wingzero		say is it normal for ubuntu to take up over 700 mb of memory for just running the system?
2009-11-25T17:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wingzero	no, thats pretty excessive
2009-11-25T17:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wingzero	try: sudo echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
2009-11-25T17:05:00.000Z	wingzero	ActionParsnip	i thought so, i also experience sudden freezes, sudden logouts and sudden reboots
2009-11-25T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wingzero	in a terminal
2009-11-25T17:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wingzero	did it help any?
2009-11-25T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wingzero	if you run: free -m   you should see a tonne more ram
2009-11-25T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wingzero	these are all to be pasted into a terminal, not irc
2009-11-25T17:10:00.000Z	wingzero	ActionParsnip	i ran them in a terminal but they are still running i see no output
2009-11-25T17:12:00.000Z	wingzero	ActionParsnip	what is a normal use of memry for just the ubuntu system?
2009-11-25T17:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wingzero	with full compiz and gnome desktop, about 400-500Mb i'd say
2009-11-25T17:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wingzero	it can be made less. mines using 495 with transmission running
2009-11-25T17:14:00.000Z	wingzero	ActionParsnip	now it uses 672 mb of memory with the destkop effect all tunred OFF, i have no idea why it uses so much
2009-11-25T17:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wingzero	run: top    see whats going on
2009-11-25T17:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wingzero	have you got video drivers running ok?
2009-11-25T17:18:00.000Z	wingzero	ActionParsnip	yes they are installed ok with the hardware drivers on the system menu
2009-11-25T17:21:00.000Z	wingzero	ActionParsnip	i have a total of 8 gig of memory, does that have anything to do with it? i am running ubuntu 9.10 64-bit
2009-11-25T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wingzero	no should be fine
2009-11-25T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wingzero	much of the "used" ram will be disk cache to make your slow hard drives access faster
2009-11-25T17:23:00.000Z	wingzero	ActionParsnip	if i do free -m, i see total 1996 used 7716 free 279 and cached 6902 is that normal?
2009-11-25T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wingzero	if you co-relate that with the output from: top    you'll see whats going on
