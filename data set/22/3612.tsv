2008-07-22T09:24:00.000Z	Dan6688		okay, this must be a really dumb question but, I've got an old PIII o' mine which is still running; think I could turn it into a server with a little mingling?
2008-07-22T09:24:00.000Z	Overand	Dan6688	yes
2008-07-22T09:24:00.000Z	Overand	Dan6688	I ran ubuntu-server on a PowerMac G4 400mhz =]
2008-07-22T09:24:00.000Z	Dan6688	Overand	would it be good enough?
2008-07-22T09:24:00.000Z	Overand	Dan6688	depends on what you want to do with it.
2008-07-22T09:24:00.000Z	Overand	Dan6688	the biggest bottleneck will be memory, likely
2008-07-22T09:25:00.000Z	Overand	Dan6688	'server' is a very, very wide category
2008-07-22T09:25:00.000Z	Dan6688	Overand	thanks =) originally I was about to rip it out and have a look at it, but I think I should be getting my server before I get my new laptop
2008-07-22T09:25:00.000Z	Overand	Dan6688	can I send you a link?
2008-07-22T09:25:00.000Z	Dan6688	Overand	yeah I reckon lol
2008-07-22T09:25:00.000Z	Dan6688	Overand	yup please
2008-07-22T09:41:00.000Z	Dan6688	Overand	I just joined that website o' yours =]
2008-07-22T09:30:00.000Z	Dan6688	Overand	LOL!
2008-07-22T09:31:00.000Z	Overand	Dan6688	By the way - I would strongly suggest you actually get the 'server edition'
2008-07-22T09:31:00.000Z	Overand	Dan6688	you don't need the overhead that having xwindows would cause
2008-07-22T09:31:00.000Z	Dan6688	Overand	of course, yeah
2008-07-22T09:41:00.000Z	Overand	Dan6688	oh?  weird
2008-07-22T09:42:00.000Z	Overand	Dan6688	that site's been offlin e for about 4 years, heh.
2008-07-22T09:42:00.000Z	Dan6688	Overand	Ugh, okay then, I didn't bother checking the date of the last posts lol
2008-07-22T09:42:00.000Z	Overand	Dan6688	people are trying to revive it, so have a blast
2008-07-22T09:42:00.000Z	Dan6688	Overand	so is THAT the performance I should be expecting? =P
2008-07-22T09:43:00.000Z	Overand	Dan6688	heh./
