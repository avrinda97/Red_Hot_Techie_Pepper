2005-04-11T07:25:00.000Z	gbhat		got a via8237 card with cmedia mixer
2005-04-11T07:25:00.000Z	gbhat		onboard
2005-04-11T07:25:00.000Z	gbhat		cant get a peep out of it
2005-04-11T07:26:00.000Z	revelater	gbhat	try unmuting everything in the control panel
2005-04-11T07:27:00.000Z	revelater	gbhat	unmute everything in the Via tab
2005-04-11T07:28:00.000Z	gbhat	revelater	everything is unmuted there
2005-04-11T07:28:00.000Z	revelater	gbhat	and make sure you have your speakers plugged in and turned on ;)
2005-04-11T07:28:00.000Z	revelater	gbhat	are you sure, did you scroll left (there are a lot of options)
2005-04-11T07:30:00.000Z	gbhat	revelater	it aint :(
2005-04-11T07:31:00.000Z	gbhat	revelater	I even disabled system sounds
2005-04-11T07:31:00.000Z	revelater	gbhat	did you blow your speakers?
2005-04-11T07:31:00.000Z	gbhat	revelater	they work when I boot into a different distro
2005-04-11T07:32:00.000Z	revelater	gbhat	when you turn your speakers all the way up, do they make more static noise than when the computer is off and speakers are all the way up?
2005-04-11T07:32:00.000Z	gbhat	revelater	never checked for that
2005-04-11T07:33:00.000Z	revelater	gbhat	it will tell you if there is something wrong with the speakers (getting a signal or not)
2005-04-11T07:33:00.000Z	gbhat	revelater	if it is  any help, unchecking and cheking the main control in kmix creates a noise from the speaker
2005-04-11T07:34:00.000Z	revelater	gbhat	alright are you sure that the kernel is USING the driver for your sound card?
2005-04-11T07:35:00.000Z	gbhat	revelater	how should I check that? lspci? lsmod?
2005-04-11T07:35:00.000Z	revelater	gbhat	not sure, i am new to linux but thats what it sounds like to me...
2005-04-11T07:36:00.000Z	revelater	gbhat	it still doesn't mean that it is using it...
2005-04-11T07:37:00.000Z	revelater	gbhat	i wish i could help, but it seems i cannt someone else will though i am sure, i have to go now though
