2009-08-20T21:17:00.000Z	sipior	GPL	have you actually seen such problems under linux?
2009-08-20T21:17:00.000Z	GPL	sipior	: Yes.
2009-08-20T21:17:00.000Z	sipior	GPL	perhaps you could post error messages for us to look at
2009-08-20T21:20:00.000Z	sipior	GPL	is it only an issue when the bittorrent client is running?
2009-08-20T21:20:00.000Z	GPL	sipior	: after Bittorrent Client runs, it corrupts the sockets, so  i 've to reset it somehow, after it all the things go fine ..
2009-08-20T21:21:00.000Z	sipior	GPL	you keep saying "corrupts the sockets", but i have no idea what you mean by that, or indeed how you verified that this in fact the issue.
2009-08-20T21:21:00.000Z	sipior	GPL	what steps have you taken to isolate the problem?
2009-08-20T21:21:00.000Z	GPL	sipior	: windowsxp.mvps.org/winsock.htm <- have a look here, maybe you get the idea
2009-08-20T21:22:00.000Z	GPL	sipior	: Under Windows, i used to do that, and everything went fine...
2009-08-20T21:22:00.000Z	sipior	GPL	we're talking about linux here, yes?
2009-08-20T21:23:00.000Z	GPL	sipior	: yes , but you can figure it out :) probably.
2009-08-20T21:24:00.000Z	sipior	GPL	if you try "ifconfig" for your network interface, does it report a large number of TX or RX errors?
2009-08-20T21:24:00.000Z	GPL	sipior	let me do so
2009-08-20T21:24:00.000Z	sipior	GPL	(collisions, dropped packets...)
2009-08-20T21:25:00.000Z	GPL	sipior	: output of ifconfig -> http://pastebin.com/m1afca9b6
2009-08-20T21:26:00.000Z	sipior	GPL	can you also paste a copy of netstat -antup when the network is behaving poorly?
2009-08-20T21:29:00.000Z	GPL	sipior	http://pastebin.com/m159b7d6b <- output of netstat -antup
2009-08-20T21:30:00.000Z	sipior	GPL	try shutting down your irc daemon, et alia, and see if one of these is the culprit.
2009-08-20T21:31:00.000Z	GPL	sipior	: i already tried that ...
2009-08-20T21:31:00.000Z	sipior	GPL	what is the *precise* behaviour you see when your network is erratic?
2009-08-20T21:32:00.000Z	sipior	GPL	also, any interesting log entries that coincide with the time of the issue?
2009-08-20T21:37:00.000Z	GPL	sipior	: i cant get into any of IM Protocols using Pidgin, i cant use IRC, it says Connection Lost at my end, and Connection reset by Peer, it's due to corrupted Sockets TCP/Ip Stacks, High network traffic etc. || I can Use HTTP thow, without any change .. in mIRC , i get 10053 error , when using other softwares, it just tries to reconnect me every time .. .. i 've watched .. over time, and it only happens after i use some bittorrent client like
