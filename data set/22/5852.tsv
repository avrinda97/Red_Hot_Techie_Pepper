2007-02-18T13:14:00.000Z	kane77		I have two scripts I'm trying to execute with other script.. the script looks like this #!/bin/bash (next line) /opt/script.sh (new line) /opt/script.php the first one doesnt get executed... why could that be?? (or alternatively is there a way to merge two scripts (one bash the other php) into one??
2007-02-18T13:15:00.000Z	colutti	kane77	the script has permission to execute? i mean chmod +x ...
2007-02-18T13:16:00.000Z	kane77	colutti	yes, and if I execute it manually then it executes...
2007-02-18T13:16:00.000Z	colutti	kane77	try this way sh /your_script
2007-02-18T13:16:00.000Z	kane77	colutti	ok
2007-02-18T13:20:00.000Z	kane77	colutti	no it doesnt work either...
2007-02-18T13:20:00.000Z	colutti	kane77	well ..
2007-02-18T13:20:00.000Z	colutti	kane77	how do you execute it manually?
2007-02-18T13:21:00.000Z	kane77	colutti	/opt/script.sh
2007-02-18T13:21:00.000Z	colutti	kane77	how about its permission?
2007-02-18T13:22:00.000Z	kane77	colutti	755 (rwxr-xr-x)
2007-02-18T13:22:00.000Z	colutti	kane77	well .. it should work .. i dont know whats going on ...
2007-02-18T13:23:00.000Z	kane77	colutti	well I have this script ftp_check (that runs the both .sh and .php scripts) and a link to it in /usr/bin
2007-02-18T13:24:00.000Z	kane77	colutti	when i run /opt/ftp_check it works but when I run only ftp_check *(the link in /usr/bin) then it doesnt run the shell script...
2007-02-18T13:24:00.000Z	colutti	kane77	weird
2007-02-18T13:24:00.000Z	kane77	colutti	and runs only the php script (???)
2007-02-18T13:24:00.000Z	colutti	kane77	very weird
2007-02-18T13:24:00.000Z	kane77	colutti	I think so :D
2007-02-18T13:25:00.000Z	colutti	kane77	you sure the first one doesnt execute?
2007-02-18T13:26:00.000Z	colutti	kane77	try to edit your script and write an echo "something" to see if it is executed ...
2007-02-18T13:27:00.000Z	colutti	kane77	i'm lost
2007-02-18T13:34:00.000Z	colutti	kane77	no problem
