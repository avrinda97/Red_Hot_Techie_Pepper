2011-04-29T00:31:00.000Z	plustax		Im in update manager running lucid lynx. and I dont see the new OS update anywhere
2011-04-29T00:31:00.000Z	plustax		how do I update from 10 to 11
2011-04-29T00:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	plustax	10.04 or 10.10 ?
2011-04-29T00:31:00.000Z	plustax	sebsebseb	i mean
2011-04-29T00:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	plustax	yep got to go through 10.10 to get 11.04
2011-04-29T00:35:00.000Z	plustax	sebsebseb	okay how do I go to 10.10 now
2011-04-29T00:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	plustax	you can upgrade to it, but  right now probably not the best time, repo's are probably pretty slow
2011-04-29T00:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	plustax	also by default 10.04 only shows Long Term Support releases
2011-04-29T00:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	plustax	by default LTS's only show other LTS's
2011-04-29T00:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	plustax	and in certain ways, you may find 10.04 better, so not sure if they got the try 11.04 online thing in a web browser up yet, but yeah that for example is a way to try 11.04
2011-04-29T00:36:00.000Z	plustax	sebsebseb	okay ill go 10.10 for now
2011-04-29T00:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	plustax	through 10.10
2011-04-29T00:39:00.000Z	plustax	sebsebseb	that just showed me how to get to 11
2011-04-29T00:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	plustax	system  > administration > update maanger
2011-04-29T00:39:00.000Z	plustax	sebsebseb	im there
2011-04-29T00:41:00.000Z	plustax	sebsebseb	pm
2011-04-29T00:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	plustax	you may have to enable the upgrade for 10.10.  keep it in the channel,  there are other people who should be able to help you better than I :)
2011-04-29T00:42:00.000Z	plustax	sebsebseb	yeah how do I do that?
2011-04-29T00:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	plustax	it should show in upgrade manager, but if not, uhmm probably in there some where to get it showing or something
2011-04-29T00:43:00.000Z	plustax	sebsebseb	i cant find it
2011-04-29T00:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	plustax	maybe you should just stay on 10.04,  10.10 and 11.04 don't really offer that much  proper advantage, well in my opinion :)
2011-04-29T00:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	plustax	plus 10.04 is Long Term Support :)
