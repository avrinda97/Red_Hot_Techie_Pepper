2006-07-15T10:40:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		oh holy shit
2006-07-15T10:40:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		it can't be piped
2006-07-15T10:41:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		bluefox@icebox:~/programming/ssp$ sudo cat /dev/mem > stuff
2006-07-15T10:41:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		cat: /dev/mem: Operation not permitted
2006-07-15T10:41:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		what the hell.
2006-07-15T10:41:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		but I can't pipe or redirect it.
2006-07-15T10:41:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		if I cat it > something or | something it says operation not permitted
2006-07-15T10:42:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		if I just cat it fucks my terminal hard.
2006-07-15T10:42:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		this sucks I just lost a big document
2006-07-15T10:42:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		hi fivre
2006-07-15T10:42:00.000Z	sproingie	bluefoxicy	please watch your language
2006-07-15T10:43:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	sproingie	I want to cat /dev/mem|grep -Hnr -n10 "License" > somefile.txt
2006-07-15T10:44:00.000Z	sproingie	bluefoxicy	that probably just isn't going to work.  cat is going to try to copy /dev/mem into a buffer ... which will appear in /dev/mem itself
2006-07-15T10:44:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	sproingie	 yes but the buffer will only exist in one place, so it'll spit that out too.
2006-07-15T10:45:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	sproingie	 the stuff is volatile, it's not a constant stream of information.  It's like reading a constantly changing file
2006-07-15T10:46:00.000Z	sproingie	bluefoxicy	isn't /dev/mem an image of the entire virtual address space of the current process though?  meaning it's always 2 gigs?
2006-07-15T10:46:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	sproingie	 that's kmem
2006-07-15T10:46:00.000Z	sproingie	bluefoxicy	i thought kmem was an image of the kernel's address space
2006-07-15T10:50:00.000Z	sproingie	bluefoxicy	i have no such problem with root being denied /dev/mem ... you running selinux or something?
2006-07-15T10:50:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	sproingie	 I'm on edgy..
2006-07-15T10:51:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	sproingie	 I get 2048 bytes out and then operation not permitted.
2006-07-15T10:51:00.000Z	sproingie	bluefoxicy	huh now that's odd
