2008-07-08T14:53:00.000Z	pradeep		how do i format
2008-07-08T14:54:00.000Z	genii	pradeep	Has it been partitioned already?
2008-07-08T14:54:00.000Z	genii	pradeep	If you run gparted it should help you partition then format it
2008-07-08T14:56:00.000Z	genii	pradeep	You can't format a disk that hasn't been partitioned yet. Gparted will let you do both in one shot
2008-07-08T15:08:00.000Z	genii	pradeep	The point of unplugging it then replugging it is to then look at the output of command: dmesg|tail  to discover what device it is. This is important so as not to format the wrong device.
2008-07-08T15:09:00.000Z	genii	pradeep	The command will have some line with something like:    /dev/sdd                or such
2008-07-08T15:11:00.000Z	genii	pradeep	Yes. I just told you that the reason to unplug and replug the usb pendrive is to determine then  which devicename it is receiving so that the correct device gets partitioned and then formatted
2008-07-08T15:13:00.000Z	genii	pradeep	OK. So now you need to know about pastebin website, so that you can post the result of command:  dmesg|tail                    to there
2008-07-08T15:13:00.000Z	genii	pradeep	After this we will know the devicename which is correct to partition then format
2008-07-08T15:14:00.000Z	genii	pradeep	Hopefully you did not accidentally say "yes" to the command you tried earlier when it told you sdb1 was mounted
2009-10-02T00:49:00.000Z	genii	pradeep	I just prefer using FasterFox addon
2009-10-02T00:49:00.000Z	pradeep	genii	but about tmpfs?
2009-10-02T00:50:00.000Z	pradeep	genii	ain't it good
2009-10-02T00:50:00.000Z	genii	pradeep	any time you're running out of ram ond not using hd it's going to be much faster of course
2009-10-02T00:51:00.000Z	pradeep	genii	hs as in hard disk? yeah just tried that tmpfs tweak
2009-10-02T00:52:00.000Z	pradeep	genii	don't know how fast it will be:-)
2009-10-09T21:11:00.000Z	genii	pradeep	We get many people who come just to try and cause problems, don't mind them much
