2006-10-21T11:49:00.000Z	rbil	BHSPitLappy	setup a high availability Linux :-)
2006-10-21T11:52:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	rbil	heh.
2006-10-21T12:18:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	rbil	oh yes, tons of bandwidth
2006-11-05T09:31:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	rbil	or, if it's more for windows, you could go NTFS and then install ntfs-3g on the linux box
2006-11-05T09:33:00.000Z	rbil	BHSPitLappy	how can anything be "more for windoze"? Anyone using Ubuntu will choose to run that more often than Windoze and will eventually drop Windoze all together.
2006-11-05T09:33:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	rbil	I meant if you're primarily using it for use with windows.
2006-11-05T09:34:00.000Z	rbil	BHSPitLappy	I know what you meant. But that "primarily" won't last that long. :-)
2006-11-05T09:35:00.000Z	rbil	BHSPitLappy	been my experience. Most people I communicate with, who have become familiar with GNU/Linux eventually drop Windoze altogether.
2006-11-05T09:36:00.000Z	rbil	BHSPitLappy	admittedly, I don't know many gamers, which is what that toy operating system is good for.
2006-11-05T09:36:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	rbil	I would, but then I'd lose some core, sometimes-necessary features.
2006-11-05T09:37:00.000Z	rbil	BHSPitLappy	a vm is the obvious answer for that
2006-11-05T09:37:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	rbil	completely incorrect. (for what I'm referring to)
2006-11-05T09:38:00.000Z	rbil	BHSPitLappy	curious, what core are you referring to? I just haven't seen it.
2006-11-05T09:38:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	rbil	sometimes I need to make a dial-up connection on this thing.
2006-11-05T09:39:00.000Z	rbil	BHSPitLappy	and you are going to dual-boot to accomplish that "core" task?
2006-11-05T09:39:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	rbil	derr, I guess I can live without a connection when it's absolutely essential.
2006-11-05T09:40:00.000Z	rbil	BHSPitLappy	don't use dialup, but surely GNU/Linux can handle that old task?
2006-11-05T09:40:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	rbil	unfortunately not. almost all modern modems you'll find in computers are WinModems
2006-11-05T09:41:00.000Z	rbil	BHSPitLappy	then buy a usr robotics REAL external modem on ebay. Geez. Keeping NTFS around and Windoze just for dialup is a bit sily. imho.
2006-11-05T09:42:00.000Z	rbil	BHSPitLappy	$10 sure beats keeping that toy operating system around. But maybe that's just me?
