2009-10-02T09:56:00.000Z	agliodbs		ubutu doesn't automount USB drives?
2009-10-02T09:58:00.000Z	agliodbs		really, I just plugged in a usb drive to my ubuntu machine
2009-10-02T09:58:00.000Z	agliodbs		and I need to manually mount it?
2009-10-02T10:00:00.000Z	agliodbs		hmmm, I see the issue
2009-10-02T10:01:00.000Z	agliodbs		how do I format a USBdrive in ubuntu?
2009-10-02T10:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	agliodbs	Same as any other drive, with your partitioning/formatting tool of choice.  I like gparted for graphical jobs.
2009-10-02T10:02:00.000Z	agliodbs	tonyyarusso	and for non-graphical?
2009-10-02T10:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	agliodbs	cfdisk
2009-10-02T10:03:00.000Z	agliodbs		ooooh
2009-10-02T10:03:00.000Z	agliodbs		cfdisk didn't like that drive
2009-10-02T10:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	agliodbs	uh oh, what happened?
2009-10-02T10:03:00.000Z	agliodbs		n
2009-10-02T10:03:00.000Z	agliodbs		Warning!!  Unsupported GPT (GUID Partition Table) detected. Use GNU Parted.
2009-10-02T10:04:00.000Z	agliodbs		gparted is a GUI tool, though, yes?
2009-10-02T10:05:00.000Z	agliodbs		:-(
2009-10-02T10:05:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	agliodbs	Intriguing.  Well, there's gparted and there's parted - parted is GNU parted, and gparted is the GNOME frontend - confusing I know.
2009-10-02T10:09:00.000Z	agliodbs	tonyyarusso	there isn't anything more user-friendly than parted?
2009-10-02T10:10:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	agliodbs	Well, you could probably use the other tool anyway, but I'm not sure what that error means, so doing what it says is probably safest.
2009-10-02T10:11:00.000Z	agliodbs	tonyyarusso	yeah, I'm just looking for a shortcut for "use the whole disk"
2009-10-02T10:11:00.000Z	agliodbs		which parted doesn't appear to have
2009-10-02T10:14:00.000Z	agliodbs		like, particularly, how do I guess the number for END for mkpartfs?
2009-10-02T10:15:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	agliodbs	Usually there's something that tells you the total number somewhere...
