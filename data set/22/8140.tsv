2005-10-14T12:33:00.000Z	HedgeMage	nalioth	I'm giving ubuntu a try because I'm considering putting my mom on it.  I used to reccommend Mandrake to newbies, but I don't like some of the changes since the whole Mandriva thing.
2005-10-14T12:33:00.000Z	nalioth	HedgeMage	well welcome and dont be afraid to ask us a thing
2005-10-14T12:34:00.000Z	HedgeMage	nalioth	why is the earth round?  Oh! You meant ask you about ubuntu! ;P
2005-10-14T12:34:00.000Z	nalioth	HedgeMage	we can discuss the world in #freenode or #ubuntu-offtopic, heh
2005-10-14T12:35:00.000Z	HedgeMage	nalioth	my first question is this: why didn't it ask me for a root pw during set up?
2005-10-14T12:43:00.000Z	HedgeMage	nalioth	how complicated is creating ubuntu packages compared to other distros?  Does ubuntu just use debian's system?
2005-10-14T12:43:00.000Z	nalioth	HedgeMage	yes
2005-10-14T13:00:00.000Z	HedgeMage	nalioth	may I /msg you?

2005-12-01T12:41:00.000Z	HedgeMage	nalioth	it's only taken me five years with the man to get him onto Linux 8)
2005-12-01T12:47:00.000Z	nalioth	HedgeMage	they either work well or as you've found on your own
2006-03-27T12:38:00.000Z	nalioth	HedgeMage	there is nobody in ##thunderbird or ##similar ?
2006-03-27T12:39:00.000Z	HedgeMage	nalioth	there apparently isn't one... they have it for firefox, but no answer there yet
2006-03-27T12:40:00.000Z	nalioth	HedgeMage	i'd think #mozilla would be a better place to ask (since it has mail/browser/etc)
2006-04-25T09:58:00.000Z	nalioth	HedgeMage	as i live and breathe! howdy! :)
2006-04-25T09:58:00.000Z	HedgeMage	nalioth	long time no see :P
