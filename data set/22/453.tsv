2011-09-23T11:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	Avoider	be careful otherwise if you want the cube I can give you a link, it is not tricky but you can loose everything while tweaking.
2011-09-23T11:52:00.000Z	Avoider		tweaking the side bar?
2011-09-23T11:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	Avoider	no any other plugins.
2011-09-23T11:52:00.000Z	Avoider		So is it best just to leave as defult?
2011-09-23T11:53:00.000Z	Avoider		Because im not so familliar with ubuntu yet
2011-09-23T11:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	Avoider	your choice you can gave the cube it just needs to be done with a little for-knowledge, of what to exspect.

2011-09-23T11:55:00.000Z	urlin2u	Avoider	I used this one in the beginning read carefully before do it. http://reformedmusings.wordpress.com/2011/05/05/howto-get-the-compiz-desktop-cube-in-ubuntu-11-04-natty-and-unity/
2011-09-23T11:56:00.000Z	Avoider		ok thanks
2011-09-23T11:57:00.000Z	urlin2u	Avoider	no problem, basically compiz has some refresh problems and the fusion icon that normaly restart compiz can be set up as a launcher to restart that is all the function it has in Natty.
