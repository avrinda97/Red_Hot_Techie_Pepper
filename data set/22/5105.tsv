2012-09-03T04:53:00.000Z	usr13	rhombus	Are you sure it's not a DVD iso?
2012-09-03T04:53:00.000Z	rhombus	usr13	Full disclosure -- it's a kubuntu iso.
2012-09-03T04:54:00.000Z	usr13	rhombus	So, what size is it?
2012-09-03T04:54:00.000Z	usr13	rhombus	and what is the name of it?
2012-09-03T04:55:00.000Z	rhombus	usr13	kubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-i386.iso
2012-09-03T04:56:00.000Z	rhombus	usr13	Size is 703.3
2012-09-03T04:56:00.000Z	usr13	rhombus	From http://www.kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/download "(the file size is 700MB)"
2012-09-03T04:56:00.000Z	rhombus	usr13	Not today it isn't :)
2012-09-03T04:57:00.000Z	usr13	rhombus	md5sum kubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-i386.iso  #And google the checksum
2012-09-03T04:57:00.000Z	rhombus	usr13	Done that already, the checksum is good.
2012-09-03T05:01:00.000Z	usr13	rhombus	Well, that looks to be accurate.  If you look at http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/precise/release/  near the bottom, it says:  "703M" for that ISO.  I assume it will fit.  What burning sofrware are you using?
2012-09-03T05:01:00.000Z	usr13	rhombus	Do you have 700M CDs?
2012-09-03T05:02:00.000Z	rhombus	usr13	I'm using k3b. The nominal size of the CD-Rs is 700 MB. The iso is exactly 703.3 MB, which is 0.5 MB shy of k3b's hard limit of 702.8 MB for that CD-R.
2012-09-03T05:03:00.000Z	usr13	rhombus	Do you have the 700M CDs, or some old 650M ones?
2012-09-03T05:04:00.000Z	usr13	rhombus	I don't know really, just speculating / guessing at a possible problem.
2012-09-03T05:04:00.000Z	rhombus	usr13	I have the 700 MB CD-Rs.
2012-09-03T05:05:00.000Z	rhombus	usr13	I think the problem is that whoever made the iso goofed and didn't check that it was within the size limit for the standard.
2012-09-03T05:05:00.000Z	rhombus	usr13	and... since this has happened before and was logged as a bug and fixed...
2012-09-03T05:05:00.000Z	usr13	rhombus	Ok, well there you go.
2012-09-03T05:06:00.000Z	rhombus	usr13	I was wondering if it was just a sub-distro problem, or if it happens to the core Ubuntu isos also.
2012-09-03T05:07:00.000Z	usr13	rhombus	I doubt that the issue would be related.
2012-09-03T05:08:00.000Z	rhombus	usr13	related to what?
