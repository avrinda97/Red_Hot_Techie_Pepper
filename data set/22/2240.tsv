2009-08-10T07:20:00.000Z	ElronMcBong		hello there. I have a fresh install of kubuntu on a machine that I cannot get online. Where can I download binaries of ubuntu packages? For some reason I cannot find a place. The webside that seems to provide them most likely (as derived through its name) is packages.ubuntu.com, which is offline. Today is such a weird day..
2009-08-10T07:21:00.000Z	boss_mc	ElronMcBong	check out aptoncd
2009-08-10T07:23:00.000Z	ElronMcBong	boss_mc	ubottu, jtaji: thanks a lot guys
2009-08-10T07:30:00.000Z	ElronMcBong	boss_mc	ubottu, jtaji: About aptoncd.. The only machine that is capable of connecting to the internet at the moment is a mac, with which I am here right now. So on a normal day packages.ubuntu.com would be my choice to download binary packages from the web, right?
2009-08-10T07:30:00.000Z	boss_mc	ElronMcBong	yeah, I think so
2009-08-10T07:31:00.000Z	ElronMcBong	boss_mc	hum, oh my
2009-08-10T07:33:00.000Z	boss_mc	ElronMcBong	or run the aptoncd in a livecd (if you have a 2nd cd drive) or in a liveusb (if you have one)
2009-08-10T07:36:00.000Z	ElronMcBong	boss_mc	Hm nice idea, I probably never would have had the idea by myself, to run a live cd on my fully working macbook :) But I think I will give it a try tomorrow, if I cannot fix wlan on the other machine by that time... Thanks again
2009-08-10T07:38:00.000Z	ElronMcBong	boss_mc	Actually I just wanted to download wicd right now... creating a whole package cd for that one application will be my last choice^^
2009-08-10T07:39:00.000Z	boss_mc	ElronMcBong	see what packages it depends on though
2009-08-10T07:52:00.000Z	ElronMcBong	boss_mc	I found a ftp mirror where I can grab the packages... http://mirror.bauhuette.fh-aachen.de/ubuntu/pool/universe/
2009-08-10T07:53:00.000Z	boss_mc	ElronMcBong	hmmm, where are you based?
2009-08-10T07:53:00.000Z	boss_mc	ElronMcBong	ok, perfect
2009-08-10T07:56:00.000Z	boss_mc	ElronMcBong	Depends: python, python-support (>= 0.7.1), python-gtk2, python-dbus, wpasupplicant, python-glade2, wireless-tools, dhcpd | dhcp3-client | pump, net-tools | ethtool, net-tools | iproute, adduser
2009-08-10T07:56:00.000Z	boss_mc	ElronMcBong	you'll need these :) (the ones with | between them are optional, i.e. at least one of net-tools or ethtool_
2009-08-10T08:03:00.000Z	ElronMcBong	boss_mc	These are some nice suggestions. I already toyed around with wpa_supplicant, that's why I was hoping that wicd does the trick instead. I'll have a look at all these applications.
2009-08-10T08:03:00.000Z	boss_mc	ElronMcBong	I meant that those were the package requirements for wicd
2009-08-10T08:04:00.000Z	boss_mc	ElronMcBong	so if you want to get the wicd package from your mirror, you'll need those installed before it will install itself
2009-08-10T08:04:00.000Z	ElronMcBong	boss_mc	Ah ok thanks, even better to know
2009-08-10T08:04:00.000Z	boss_mc	ElronMcBong	this is why we use apt! it sorts out dependency hell for you
2009-08-10T08:04:00.000Z	boss_mc	ElronMcBong	remember, each of those might have dependencies themselves...
2009-08-10T08:10:00.000Z	ElronMcBong	boss_mc	Yeah I know, actually I was using *bsd, gentoo already about five years ago and ubuntu in vmware from within os x. You know back then they either provided an iso image full of binaries or I would have a router that I could connect to without a problem. These days there is no binaries cd and I left my router in my old flat. Right now I am sharing internet with my neighbors who own the router and I bet the router is sp
