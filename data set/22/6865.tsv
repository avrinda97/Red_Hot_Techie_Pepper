2006-07-28T10:27:00.000Z	phazeman		does anone here uses some film scanner with ubuntu ?
2006-07-28T10:28:00.000Z	WhiteNinja	phazeman	u r meaning scanning dias?
2006-07-28T10:28:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	i mean a film dedicated scanner like my minolta dimage scan elite II
2006-07-28T10:29:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	 i don't know what is a dia scanner, but i have an epson flatbed also... but i think it will not be a problem since i've tried it already with the livecd
2006-07-28T10:30:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	i couldn't get te minolta to be recognized by sane though
2006-07-28T10:31:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	the epson worked right out of the box. the minolta was recognized just fine (as the log says) but i couldn't get it to work wit any scan software
2006-07-28T10:32:00.000Z	WhiteNinja	phazeman	u have looked at minolta.com?
2006-07-28T10:32:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	yep... since this model was discontinued loooong time ago - there is nothing about it there
2006-07-28T10:55:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	looks like there is a way to work with that scanner under linux.. it's the VueScan that makes it possible...
2006-07-28T10:56:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	:)
2006-07-28T10:56:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	my linux machine dead more then 2 weeks already so i've decided to find out if my scanners will work under linux... if they are - kubuntu, here we g again :)
2006-07-28T10:58:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	me != gnome... never liked it... lways been a KDE/Flux guy
2006-07-28T10:59:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	i've transferred from mandriva.. you know...
2006-07-28T10:59:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	i've found that installing ubuntu and then kde-dekstop makes the thingy better then installing the kubuntu :)
2006-07-28T11:00:00.000Z	WhiteNinja	phazeman	installing xyz-desktop is a good idea to have some basic files in it, too... but sometimes u will run in gnome-problems.. even in kde oder xfce
2006-07-28T11:01:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	basicly, you are right... but i can't force mself using something i don't really like...
2006-07-28T11:01:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	i still wait for the e17 ubuntu version :) thats why asked about ebuntu
2006-07-28T11:03:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	lolo
2006-07-28T11:04:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	you can do that with vmware you know...
2006-07-28T11:04:00.000Z	WhiteNinja	phazeman	not with directX
2006-07-28T11:05:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	use vmware for coding and native for gaming :)
2006-07-28T11:10:00.000Z	phazeman	WhiteNinja	COOL ! thanks
