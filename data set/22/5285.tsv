2007-06-02T14:31:00.000Z	g_zoli		Sorry I don't speek good english...
2007-06-02T14:32:00.000Z	g_zoli		Pls. help my
2007-06-02T14:32:00.000Z	g_zoli		I want upgrade my Kubuntu6.10 to ubuntu 7.10
2007-06-02T14:32:00.000Z	g_zoli		can I upgrade with Ubuntu live Cd
2007-06-02T14:33:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	i believe that you need the alternate (i.e., not live ) CD for upgrading
2007-06-02T14:41:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	i'm not quite following you there
2007-06-02T14:42:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	you currently have kubuntu installed, and you want to change to ubuntu? (i.e., 'gnome' ubuntu)
2007-06-02T14:43:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	i don't know for sure, but I don't think that you can easily 'cross-upgrade' from kubuntu 6.10 to ubuntu 7.04 using only the alternate cd
2007-06-02T14:45:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	there is a kubuntu alternate CD too, which might be helpful
2007-06-02T14:46:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	just to check: you don't have a fast internet connection?
2007-06-02T14:47:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	hm.  have you downloaded any CDs yet ?
2007-06-02T14:47:00.000Z	g_zoli	roryy	: yes I have 1 alternate and 1 live ubuntu 7.04 Cd
2007-06-02T14:49:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	do you perhaps have the ubuntu 6.10 alternate cd?
2007-06-02T14:49:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	well, I downloaded the ubuntu alternate CD
2007-06-02T14:50:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	i'm on dial-up (56k)
2007-06-02T14:51:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	it took about 30 hours (!).  If you have the patience, and it's affordable, i'd recommend downloading the kubuntu alternate CD
2007-06-02T14:51:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	otherwise it might be easiest to back up your personal data and do a clean install of ubuntu
2007-06-02T14:52:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	great.  have you read the upgrade instructions on the wiki?
2007-06-02T14:54:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	at the bottom of this page -- http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading  -- there are instructions for using the alternate CD with kubuntu
2007-06-02T14:55:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	unfortunately you need to install gksu for that to work
2007-06-02T14:58:00.000Z	roryy	g_zoli	unfortunately i'm very tired; i need to go to bed.  I hope someone else can help you.
