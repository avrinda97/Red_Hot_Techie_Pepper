2011-01-24T09:17:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	it might be easier if you use simple-ccsm
2011-01-24T09:17:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	It's easier to figure out at first
2011-01-24T09:18:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	use simple-ccsm
2011-01-24T09:25:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	I can help.  Install simple-ccsm
2011-01-24T09:25:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	:)
2011-01-24T09:26:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	the simple ccsm is in System -> preferences farther down (simple-ccsm)
2011-01-24T09:27:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	You don't have to switch channels.  I'll help you
2011-01-24T09:27:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	If we need to reset everything to the defaults we can do so by removing the hidden .compiz folder.  rm -r ~/.compiz
2011-01-24T09:28:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	how's it going?
2011-01-24T09:28:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	tha'ts ok.  What part are you confused about?
2011-01-24T09:29:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	first answer me this.  Do you have a simple-ccsm in System-> preferences   ?
2011-01-24T09:29:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	if you use simple-ccsm does it work? (we'll get to resetting the defaults after this)
2011-01-24T09:30:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	turn the cube on using simple-ccsm
2011-01-24T09:30:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	does that not work?
2011-01-24T09:31:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	ok.  open a terminal and run this command in it to reset compiz.  It deletes a folder
2011-01-24T09:31:00.000Z	edbian	grandmaster	the command: rm -r ~/.compiz
