2012-06-06T12:54:00.000Z	danabr		Yeah, exactly. It is actually a remote web server that has to be able to do printouts on the printers on the local network
2012-06-06T12:55:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	danabr	I've done "remote" printing before, but it was a network printer and I used ssh port-forwarding
2012-06-06T13:00:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	danabr	that is almost the exact setup I use (ssl my_server_ip -Lprinter_port:printer_ip:printer_port) then add the "localhost" printer in cups :)
2012-06-06T13:14:00.000Z	danabr	DarwinSurvivor	Hmm, I am trying to test port forwarding locally (by tunneling via localhost), but when I try to use lpr, it says "Connection refused"
2012-06-06T13:15:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	danabr	what port did you forward (just copy-paste your ssh command)
2012-06-06T13:15:00.000Z	danabr	DarwinSurvivor	The SSH tunnel connection says: "open failed: Connection refused"
2012-06-06T13:16:00.000Z	danabr	DarwinSurvivor	ssh -L 8324:localhost:689 daniel@localhost
2012-06-06T13:17:00.000Z	danabr	DarwinSurvivor	Sorry, it should be port 631
2012-06-06T13:17:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	danabr	you don't want to ssh into localhost, you want to ssh into the server that has access to the printers!
2012-06-06T13:18:00.000Z	danabr	DarwinSurvivor	Yeah, I know that, but currently I do not have that server. I just wanted to test that tunneling worked, and that cups did not complain
2012-06-06T13:18:00.000Z	danabr	DarwinSurvivor	I managed to get it to work. I had written the wrong port number for CUPS
2012-06-06T13:18:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	danabr	you can't forward to a port that is in use (try forwarding 631 to 632 to see if it's working)
2012-06-06T13:19:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	danabr	is the printer a network printer, or connected directly to the other machine?
2012-06-06T13:20:00.000Z	danabr	DarwinSurvivor	All printers will be network printers, all connected to one workstation that has an internet connection
2012-06-06T13:20:00.000Z	danabr	DarwinSurvivor	However, tunneling actually seems to work. Thanks a lot!
2012-06-06T13:20:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	danabr	do you need access to *all* printers, or just one?
2012-06-06T13:21:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	danabr	if you need to access a *lot* of internal resources, you may want to consider a VPN, it's more involved to set up, but may save some work in the future
2012-06-06T13:21:00.000Z	danabr	DarwinSurvivor	I need access to them all. I'll discuss a VPN with my boss.
2012-06-06T13:22:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	danabr	you can also port-forward directly to the printers, then you are accessing cups localy (may be more or less troublesome)
2012-06-06T13:23:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	danabr	just make sure you firewall the external machine, you don't want the entire internet being able to use those forwarded ports!
2012-06-06T13:23:00.000Z	danabr	DarwinSurvivor	Nah, I rather just port forward to one printer server. Then I just need to know the printer names in order to print with lpr.
2012-06-06T13:24:00.000Z	danabr	DarwinSurvivor	A firewall will be used of course :)
