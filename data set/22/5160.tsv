2007-07-05T14:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Humpy	well, good luck, why didn't you just install the current version?
2007-07-05T14:25:00.000Z	Humpy	IndyGunFreak	I dunno... lol is the 7.04 better?
2007-07-05T14:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Humpy	well, its current.
2007-07-05T14:25:00.000Z	Humpy	IndyGunFreak	so I am gonna install it then... but the cmd I am using should work?
2007-07-05T14:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Humpy	what command are you using?
2007-07-05T14:26:00.000Z	Humpy	IndyGunFreak	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2007-07-05T14:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Humpy	why are you trying to install ubuntu desktop? if you're using Gnome, the packages are already installed.
2007-07-05T14:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Humpy	in the feisty repos, that command should work.
2007-07-05T14:28:00.000Z	Humpy	IndyGunFreak	Well my goal is to use a GUI version
2007-07-05T14:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Humpy	so you're using CLI only?
2007-07-05T14:28:00.000Z	Humpy	IndyGunFreak	I dunno...
2007-07-05T14:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		you don't know/
2007-07-05T14:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		forget it... stick with windows
2007-07-05T14:29:00.000Z	Humpy	IndyGunFreak	I think I am not going to stick with windows, I am determined to learn this stuff
2007-07-05T14:29:00.000Z	Humpy	IndyGunFreak	Linux is more reliable and powerful, even though I dunno what I am doing
2007-07-05T14:30:00.000Z	Humpy	IndyGunFreak	but thanks for the help
