2012-02-16T23:31:00.000Z	Jonathan_	h00k	Do you know how to change the kernel, I used to be running an linux-server one, but not I'm running a generic
2012-02-16T23:21:00.000Z	h00k	Jonathan_	it could be a lot of things, i'd start by testing your memory
2012-02-16T23:22:00.000Z	Jonathan_	h00k	Alright, because I've been trying to fix it by upgrading my kernel and modifying boot entries etc.. but to not avail
2012-02-16T23:22:00.000Z	Jonathan_	h00k	I'll let a memtest sit over night
2012-02-16T23:22:00.000Z	h00k	Jonathan_	I had one do that, it turned out to be a bad L2 cache on my processor.
2012-02-16T23:22:00.000Z	h00k	Jonathan_	most likely hardware, though.
2012-02-16T23:23:00.000Z	Jonathan_	h00k	How do you test the CPU?
2012-02-16T23:23:00.000Z	Jonathan_	h00k	How do I test any hardware, except for smart statuses and memtests
2012-02-16T23:25:00.000Z	h00k	Jonathan_	let me look for what I used, standby.
2012-02-16T23:25:00.000Z	Jonathan_	h00k	when it freezes, the computer is still running, but it shuts down VPN, SSH, eth0 etc etc
2012-02-16T23:25:00.000Z	Jonathan_	h00k	It's not responding to anything though
2012-02-16T23:27:00.000Z	h00k	Jonathan_	did you check your logs for any kernel panics? they're in /var/logs, I'd start there. If the kernel is panicking without being able to write a log, you can configure it to dump the information out to a serial device, which is what I managed to figure out how to do.
2012-02-16T23:29:00.000Z	h00k	Jonathan_	this may help: http://www.iitk.ac.in/LDP/HOWTO/Remote-Serial-Console-HOWTO/index.html
2012-02-16T23:29:00.000Z	Jonathan_	h00k	There is nothing in the logs, I've tried tailing them over SSH
2012-02-16T23:29:00.000Z	h00k	Jonathan_	it might be failing before it gets to write them.
2012-02-16T23:30:00.000Z	Jonathan_	h00k	I probably is
2012-02-16T23:30:00.000Z	h00k	Jonathan_	this may help: http://www.vincentverhagen.nl/2008/08/07/capturing-linux-kernel-panic-info/
2012-02-16T23:32:00.000Z	Jonathan_	h00k	And I want to switch back
2012-02-16T23:33:00.000Z	h00k	Jonathan_	you can change what kernel you boot by holding down left-shift when GRUB appears
2012-02-16T23:33:00.000Z	Jonathan_	h00k	How do I do that
2012-02-16T23:34:00.000Z	h00k	Jonathan_	you can configure it in Grub,
2012-02-16T23:34:00.000Z	Jonathan_	h00k	I know I can do it in grub, but there's supposed to be a way to do it automaticly
