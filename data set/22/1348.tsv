2012-01-22T21:16:00.000Z	CyberDawg	ikonia	isnt dual boot and dual OS partitions different?
2012-01-22T21:17:00.000Z	ikonia	CyberDawg	sure, have I missunderstood what you want to do ?
2012-01-22T21:18:00.000Z	CyberDawg	ikonia	 I am pretty new to Linux and partitioning... I want to partition a drive for Windows 7 and Ubutu 11.10 with a common spane for my files
2012-01-22T21:18:00.000Z	ikonia	CyberDawg	ok, so do that, 3 partitions, ubuntu/windows/spare
2012-01-22T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	CyberDawg	fine,
2012-01-22T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	CyberDawg	it really doesn't matter
2012-01-22T21:19:00.000Z	CyberDawg	ikonia	more importantly I want to learn the "correct" way to go about it.... a site with those shiny little pics maybe?? :)
2012-01-22T21:20:00.000Z	ikonia	CyberDawg	there is no correct way, it's how you want to it
2012-01-22T21:20:00.000Z	CyberDawg	ikonia	Ive been told Windas gets pissed if its not first on the drive
2012-01-22T21:20:00.000Z	ikonia	CyberDawg	windows wants a small partition at the start for the install, sure, but the windows installer deals with that
2012-01-22T21:21:00.000Z	ikonia	CyberDawg	reading the dualboot info I gave you will explain this
2012-01-22T21:21:00.000Z	CyberDawg	ikonia	 thank you sir for your time :)
2012-01-22T21:24:00.000Z	ikonia	CyberDawg	that is incorrect
2012-01-22T21:24:00.000Z	ikonia	CyberDawg	|Anthony| is mistaken
2012-01-22T21:26:00.000Z	CyberDawg	ikonia	is it best to partition the drive into seperate sections or let the OS's duke it out...
2012-01-22T21:26:00.000Z	ikonia	CyberDawg	if you are going to have 2 OS's on the drive, they will have to be on seperate partitions
2012-01-22T21:27:00.000Z	CyberDawg	ikonia	correct but its it best to make the drive a single partition, install windos first, then Ubuntu  or use disk manager and chunkk it up first?
2012-01-22T21:27:00.000Z	ikonia	CyberDawg	again, the dualboot link I gave you earlier will explain this, but windows first is the common approach
2012-01-22T21:28:00.000Z	CyberDawg	ikonia	thanks again
2012-01-22T21:32:00.000Z	CyberDawg	ikonia	the dual boot url you shared is very informative and explains many of my questions regarding how the OS's think... thanks again
2012-01-22T22:07:00.000Z	CyberDawg	ikonia	was it you was discussing partitioning to a few minutes ago?
