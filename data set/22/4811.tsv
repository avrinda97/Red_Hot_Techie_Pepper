2009-10-03T22:23:00.000Z	yowshi	coz_	yeah changing ubuntu theme had no effect on firfox texxt
2009-10-03T22:23:00.000Z	yowshi	coz_	but i do like this high contrast inverse
2009-10-03T22:24:00.000Z	coz_	yowshi	 ok if that works then use it    because the issue is a little strange  I have not had that issue unless it was caused by a bad firefox theme or gtk2 theme
