2006-04-23T12:17:00.000Z	danielch		I have Ubuntu 5.10 and FC5 in my Toshiba TE2000 laptop, but Ubuntu sometimes freezes, FC5 doesn't. I have tried that booting with the option "nolapic noapic" and "acpi=off pci=noacpi", it seems better, but it still exists. However, FC4/5 works well using the default setting and the ACPI seems works. Anybody encountered that issue?
