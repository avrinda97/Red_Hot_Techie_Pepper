2012-02-03T14:59:00.000Z	damo22		what does ubuntu use for remote desktop sharing/
2012-02-03T14:59:00.000Z	damo22		what is the name of the program?
2012-02-03T14:59:00.000Z	theadmin	damo22	Vinagre if I recall right
2012-02-06T14:40:00.000Z	damo22	theadmin	i wouldnt call it an iso file, more like a .dd
2012-02-06T14:41:00.000Z	theadmin	damo22	If it's a real bootable Win7 stick created from an ISO, this is... supposed to work at least
2012-02-06T14:42:00.000Z	damo22	theadmin	sorry what was the question ?
2012-02-06T14:43:00.000Z	damo22	theadmin	is someone trying to make a bootable backup of a usb stick?
2012-02-06T16:13:00.000Z	theadmin	damo22	Technically yes, since a normal user can grab a livecd and boot. But other than that, well, the "chroot" command needs root priveleges.
2012-02-10T16:45:00.000Z	damo22	theadmin	destroying the bios? that would suck
2012-02-10T16:47:00.000Z	theadmin	damo22	Well, doesn't quite make it impossible though
2012-02-10T16:48:00.000Z	damo22	theadmin	would be easier to take a hammer to the mb
2012-02-12T19:05:00.000Z	damo22	theadmin	some people like a lot of nothing
2012-02-12T19:05:00.000Z	theadmin	damo22	But nothing is /dev/null. A zero is at least something :P
2012-02-12T19:06:00.000Z	damo22	theadmin	it would provide a great tool to mask a 40G series of bits and output another 40G of zeros
2012-02-12T19:07:00.000Z	theadmin	damo22	Well, yeah, but I still don't see the point... If you're trying to securely delete a file you can use shred...
2012-02-12T19:07:00.000Z	damo22	theadmin	securely deleting a file isnt done with zeros, its obvious that someone deleted the file
2012-02-12T19:08:00.000Z	theadmin	damo22	Which is why I'm asking -- what is the point? :D
2012-02-12T19:09:00.000Z	damo22	theadmin	it would be okay to dd zeros to the first 100Mb of the drive just to wipe most traces of the filesystem
2012-02-12T19:13:00.000Z	theadmin	damo22	Defrag a drive? There is e4defrag and such things...
2012-02-13T12:26:00.000Z	theadmin	damo22	Any sane client will do it. Hell, even Pidgin does that.
2012-02-13T12:26:00.000Z	damo22	theadmin	im on macosx running xchat and it does not autocomplete nicks
2012-02-14T18:50:00.000Z	theadmin	damo22	Two dashes (--no-recommends)
