2007-05-22T11:57:00.000Z	Beets		I really have no clue why setting resolution in Ubuntu is so incredible hard...
2007-05-22T11:58:00.000Z	shane634	Beets	edit xorg.conf is all
2007-05-22T12:33:00.000Z	shane634	Beets	what is the issue exactly?
2007-05-22T12:33:00.000Z	Beets	shane634	I can only choose between 640, 800, 1024 and 1280 in the resolution setting, and 60Hz in the refresh setting..
2007-05-22T12:34:00.000Z	shane634	Beets	can you set em in xorg.conf?
2007-05-22T12:34:00.000Z	Beets	shane634	that has no effect what so ever.. It is as if the Screen Resolution app lives its own life...
2007-05-22T12:35:00.000Z	shane634	Beets	yes it is a seperate deal can you post your xorg.conf in pastebin?
2007-05-22T12:36:00.000Z	Beets	shane634	pastebin is down.. what's the name of the other one again?
2007-05-22T12:36:00.000Z	shane634	Beets	beats me lol
2007-05-22T12:39:00.000Z	Beets	shane634	This is the modified-to-the bone version:  http://pastebin.ca/503057
2007-05-22T12:39:00.000Z	Beets	shane634	this is the original:  http://pastebin.ca/503059
2007-05-22T12:41:00.000Z	shane634	Beets	what are the actual issues?
2007-05-22T12:42:00.000Z	Beets	shane634	no matter what modelines I insert, it offers the same low res/refresh options in the "Screen Resolution" app
2007-05-22T12:42:00.000Z	shane634	Beets	ok
2007-05-22T12:43:00.000Z	Beets	shane634	I need to be able to set a usable res, like 1600x1200@75Hz
2007-05-22T12:43:00.000Z	shane634	Beets	you need to change the res lines to the highest res you can use is all
2007-05-22T12:43:00.000Z	shane634	Beets	add 1600.1200 on all lines
2007-05-22T12:43:00.000Z	Beets	shane634	I did that... but it doesn't respect it.
2007-05-22T12:44:00.000Z	shane634	Beets	did you save the file ??
2007-05-22T12:44:00.000Z	Beets	shane634	yup, naturally :-)
2007-05-22T12:45:00.000Z	shane634	Beets	for stuff and grins try it again
2007-05-22T12:48:00.000Z	shane634	Beets	any luck
