2007-07-19T10:05:00.000Z	Moduliz0r		Does uTorrent run well under Wine?
2007-07-19T10:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 seems to work  :)
2007-07-19T10:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 at least the older versions did.
2007-07-19T10:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 not sure thats in the latest release.. not sure if that feature works with wine either. ;)
2007-07-19T10:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 ick!
2007-07-19T10:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 seen that done like 15+ yrs ago.... badly
2007-07-19T10:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 back when they had real speakers.. not these little coinsized buzzers
2007-07-19T10:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 the 'beep' command can do different beeps.
2007-07-19T10:10:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	dr_willis	how did you do it?
2007-07-19T10:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 installed the beep command, and put some commands in the rc.local
2007-07-19T10:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 in /etc/ with all the rest of the config type files. :)
2007-07-22T13:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 easy way - put it in the rc.local script
2007-07-22T13:26:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	dr_willis	 Will it get run as root?
2007-07-22T13:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 you can always use su i think to make it run as other users of course.
2007-07-22T13:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 use su IN the rc.local script
2007-07-22T13:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 'man su'
2007-07-22T13:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 it has an option as to what user to run as- I belive.
2007-07-22T13:28:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	dr_willis	But without it, will it run as root in rc.local? thats what I want
2007-07-22T13:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 then of course it will run as root. :)
2007-07-22T13:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 might be Safer to runit as a user.. but it depends on how paranoid you are i ugess
2007-07-22T13:29:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	dr_willis	The script puts it down to a user
2007-07-22T13:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	Moduliz0r	 may wan tto check the advanced bash scripting guide, and the Bash docs for that. Its somthign to do with spawning a child process Ibelive
