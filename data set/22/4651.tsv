2008-06-29T13:20:00.000Z	Ralith	vox	no, it builds fine
2008-06-29T13:21:00.000Z	Ralith	vox	I can pastebin the exact errors; they're amazingly human readable
2008-06-29T13:23:00.000Z	vox	Ralith	what card?
2008-06-29T13:24:00.000Z	Ralith	vox	geforce 9600
2008-06-29T13:24:00.000Z	Ralith	vox	which is why I'm forced to do the manual install; ubuntu drivers don't do >8k series yet, apparently
2008-06-29T13:25:00.000Z	vox	Ralith	9600 or 9600gt?
2008-06-29T13:27:00.000Z	vox	Ralith	and which nvidia driver version
2008-06-29T13:28:00.000Z	Ralith	vox	one sec
2008-06-29T13:28:00.000Z	Ralith	vox	driver version 173.14.09
2008-06-29T13:29:00.000Z	Ralith	vox	er, had it slightly wrong earlier; card is a 9500 GS
2008-06-29T13:29:00.000Z	vox	Ralith	the GS isnt supported yet
2008-06-29T13:29:00.000Z	vox	Ralith	http://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_18897.html
2008-06-29T13:29:00.000Z	Ralith	vox	wait what
2008-06-29T13:30:00.000Z	Ralith	vox	GeForce 9500M GS
2008-06-29T13:30:00.000Z	Ralith	vox	that looks supported to me
2008-06-29T13:30:00.000Z	Ralith	vox	yes exactly
2008-06-29T13:32:00.000Z	vox	Ralith	does your bios let you change where the card gets its memmory allocation from?
2008-06-29T13:33:00.000Z	Ralith	vox	I don't know, but can check; what sort of options should I be expecting? Manual range specification, or autoselection provider, or what?
2008-06-29T13:33:00.000Z	vox	Ralith	to be honest im not sure, but most built-in gfx cards have options as to what section of memmory they should map to in bios
2008-06-29T13:44:00.000Z	Ralith	vox	unable to locate any promising looking options
