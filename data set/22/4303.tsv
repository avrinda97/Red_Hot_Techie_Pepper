2008-01-25T10:48:00.000Z	ganesh		how to update the grub while copying the file system from livecd
2008-01-25T10:48:00.000Z	mystik	ganesh	when using install-grub there's a command-line option to specify the root fs
2008-01-25T10:49:00.000Z	ganesh	mystik	i think i have to run this command throgh chroot
2008-01-25T10:49:00.000Z	ganesh	mystik	am i correct
2008-01-25T10:50:00.000Z	mystik	ganesh	yes, grub-install is a sudo command (required)
2008-01-25T10:50:00.000Z	ganesh	mystik	i did but im getting error
2008-01-25T10:50:00.000Z	mystik	ganesh	whats the error?
2008-01-25T10:50:00.000Z	ganesh	mystik	not able to read stage1
2008-01-25T10:51:00.000Z	ganesh	mystik	im not not getting the menu.lst also
2008-01-25T10:51:00.000Z	mystik	ganesh	you should do a full reinstall of grub, specifiying the current fs with command line parameters. it should re-create all necessary files and associations
2008-01-25T10:52:00.000Z	ganesh	mystik	how to reinstall the grub
2008-01-25T10:52:00.000Z	ganesh	mystik	how to reinstall the grub in the copied filesystem
2008-01-25T10:52:00.000Z	mystik	ganesh	from the command line run 'sudo grub-install' it will give you command line options, you'll want to set the root to the device that is your primary (booted) harddrive. eg. /dev/hda1
2008-01-25T10:54:00.000Z	ganesh	mystik	grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/newpartition /dev/hda1
2008-01-25T10:54:00.000Z	ganesh	mystik	this only gave an err not able to read stage1
2008-01-25T10:54:00.000Z	mystik	ganesh	it should be 'sudo grub-install --root-directory=/dev/hda1
2008-01-25T10:55:00.000Z	mystik	ganesh	if that doesn't work, mount /dev/hda1 using the mount command, then re-run the command with the mounted point rather than /dev/hda1
2008-01-25T10:55:00.000Z	ganesh	mystik	i mounted & ran the command
2008-01-25T10:56:00.000Z	mystik	ganesh	i'd recommend taking the specific error code to the support sites specific to grub.
2008-01-25T10:57:00.000Z	ganesh	mystik	tell the grub support site
2008-01-25T10:57:00.000Z	mystik	ganesh	you'll have to search for it.
2008-01-25T10:57:00.000Z	ganesh	mystik	ok thanks
