2008-08-23T09:44:00.000Z	calc	Bhavesh	memory helps, but cpu speed doesn't matter too much
2008-08-23T09:44:00.000Z	Bhavesh	calc	i am jealous :) i only got 1GB of memory
2008-08-23T09:45:00.000Z	Bhavesh	calc	memory helps building anything :) i have installed gentoo with less memory :)
2008-08-23T09:46:00.000Z	calc	Bhavesh	especially for something like OOo i easily swapped when building with just 2GB ram
2008-08-23T09:47:00.000Z	Bhavesh	calc	i have paid $45 for a stick of 256MB dimm
2008-08-23T09:48:00.000Z	Bhavesh	calc	nevermind :) u beat me
2008-08-23T09:49:00.000Z	calc	Bhavesh	yep, i'm an old geek ;-)
2008-08-23T09:49:00.000Z	Bhavesh	calc	i am young geek and proud of it :)
2008-08-23T09:50:00.000Z	Bhavesh	calc	i have matrox millenium with 2MB ram i paid $350 for
2008-08-23T09:51:00.000Z	calc	Bhavesh	yea i think it might have been a 4MB millenium, was around 1996/7
2008-08-23T09:52:00.000Z	calc	Bhavesh	three separate controller cards?
2008-08-23T09:52:00.000Z	Bhavesh	calc	1. built in, 2, built in with RAID, and 3, add on
2008-08-23T09:53:00.000Z	calc	Bhavesh	it should probably be trying to boot off the built in one
2008-08-23T09:53:00.000Z	Bhavesh	calc	when i take out the add in card, system boots just fine
2008-08-23T09:54:00.000Z	calc	Bhavesh	hmm maybe the add in card is doing something weird to the bios
2008-08-23T09:57:00.000Z	Bhavesh	calc	of course this is an old m/b dual PIII
2008-08-23T09:57:00.000Z	calc	Bhavesh	those were fun especially running dual overclocked celerons on them ;-)
2008-08-23T09:58:00.000Z	Bhavesh	calc	hehe well for now it's simple dual PIII @ 1G
2008-08-23T10:02:00.000Z	Bhavesh	calc	i think system doesn't like 3 ctrl cards
2008-08-23T10:03:00.000Z	calc	Bhavesh	maybe not
2008-08-23T10:07:00.000Z	Bhavesh	calc	i think system has issues having 3 controller cards
