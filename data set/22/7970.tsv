2005-11-16T08:53:00.000Z	DrKritical		Does anyone know of any documentation for setting up a virtual email server in ubuntu (I have an mx record pointed at my ip)
2005-11-16T08:53:00.000Z	Razor-X	DrKritical	if you want a real full-blown server, my suggestion is to read a *lot* of docs
2005-11-16T08:54:00.000Z	Razor-X	DrKritical	are you going to do SMTP forwarding, or will it act as a mail server?
2005-11-16T08:54:00.000Z	Razor-X	DrKritical	ok, that wouldn't be too hard
2005-11-16T08:55:00.000Z	Razor-X	DrKritical	I use a similar setup using fetchmail and nbsmtp
2005-11-16T08:55:00.000Z	DrKritical	Razor-X	Can you suggest a good program? mybe even one with a nice GUI :D
2005-11-16T08:55:00.000Z	Razor-X	DrKritical	oh um... *cough*
2005-11-16T08:55:00.000Z	Razor-X	DrKritical	I haven't seen much by the way of an MTA and GUI
2005-11-16T08:55:00.000Z	Razor-X	DrKritical	I have an actual working setup if you want that
2005-11-16T08:56:00.000Z	DrKritical	Razor-X	yes please!
2005-11-16T08:56:00.000Z	Razor-X	DrKritical	is nbsmtp in the breezy repos?
2005-11-16T08:56:00.000Z	Razor-X	DrKritical	(I use hoary, and it isn't, so I compiled it)
2005-11-16T08:56:00.000Z	DrKritical	Razor-X	one second
2005-11-16T08:57:00.000Z	DrKritical	Razor-X	nah it's not... whats that for? I thought fetchmail was an smtp server?
2005-11-16T08:57:00.000Z	Razor-X	DrKritical	fetchmail fetches your mail
2005-11-16T08:58:00.000Z	Razor-X	DrKritical	it's a severely limited MTA
2005-11-16T08:58:00.000Z	DrKritical	Razor-X	So fetchmail isn't really needed in what I want to do? I should be more concerned about nbsmtp?...
2005-11-16T08:58:00.000Z	Razor-X	DrKritical	yeah, pretty much
2005-11-16T08:58:00.000Z	Razor-X	DrKritical	fetchmail gets your mail, nbsmtp gives it
2005-11-16T08:59:00.000Z	DrKritical	Razor-X	I'm a little concerned compiling my own software for an smtp server... because I couldn't be trusted to keep it updated... know of any other software packages that do the same job avaliable in repos?
2005-11-16T08:59:00.000Z	Razor-X	DrKritical	nbsmtp is real simple to setup, assuming you use mutt, a tad bit harder if you don't, but still simple
2005-11-16T09:00:00.000Z	Razor-X	DrKritical	yeah, I thought the same too, but nbsmtp really works for this purpose, it is the ``No-Brainer SMTP server'' :P
