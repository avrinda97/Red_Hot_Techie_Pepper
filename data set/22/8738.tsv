2005-12-01T08:51:00.000Z	ogra	robotgeek	but i can answer you here ;)
2005-12-01T08:51:00.000Z	robotgeek	ogra	thanks
2005-12-01T08:51:00.000Z	ogra	robotgeek	the apps have gksudo in their .desktop files so enabling a root password only helps on console ...
2005-12-01T08:51:00.000Z	robotgeek	ogra	so it basically leaves you with 2 superusers
2005-12-01T08:52:00.000Z	ogra	robotgeek	indeed you could edit all the .desktop files (which hold the menu entries) but that would be reverted on upgrades
2005-12-01T08:52:00.000Z	ogra	robotgeek	nope, it leaves you with a sudo account and you have additionally enabled the root account ...
2005-12-01T08:52:00.000Z	robotgeek	ogra	but the gksudo will work with the user's password
2005-12-01T08:52:00.000Z	ogra	robotgeek	yup
2005-12-01T08:53:00.000Z	ogra	robotgeek	imho its totally pointless to enable root ... (others might disagree here :) )
2005-12-01T08:53:00.000Z	robotgeek	ogra	so, it just makes the system inherently more vulnerable
2005-12-01T08:53:00.000Z	robotgeek	ogra	i'm of the same opinion, but i need to know so that i can tell others :)
2005-12-01T08:54:00.000Z	ogra	robotgeek	it shouldnt make the system more vulnerable ... its just useless ...
2005-12-01T08:55:00.000Z	robotgeek	ogra	agreed. and a sudo passwd -l root will restore normalcy :)
2005-12-01T08:55:00.000Z	ogra	robotgeek	yup
2005-12-01T08:55:00.000Z	robotgeek	ogra	appreciate your help
2005-12-01T08:55:00.000Z	ogra	robotgeek	youre welcome :)
2005-12-01T08:56:00.000Z	robotgeek	ogra	i pretty much hang in here 12 outta 24 hours. it was kinda redundant asking in here :)
2005-12-01T08:57:00.000Z	ogra	robotgeek	yes, but we dont pam the -dev channel with support stuff ;)
2005-12-01T08:57:00.000Z	robotgeek	ogra	agreed, my bad.
2005-12-01T08:57:00.000Z	robotgeek	ogra	the question is, how do i find someone to bug. lol
2005-12-01T08:58:00.000Z	ogra	robotgeek	look in -dev and ping the people in here might work i guess ...
2005-12-01T08:58:00.000Z	robotgeek	ogra	good idea. tht shud work
