2005-06-25T12:11:00.000Z	RobNyc		how would ubuntu run on my celeron 633mhz 256mb pc ?
2005-06-25T12:11:00.000Z	RobNyc		is 512mb swap enough ?
2005-06-25T12:12:00.000Z	RobNyc		thanks
2005-06-25T12:14:00.000Z	RobNyc		Linux ubuntu 2.6.10-5-686 #1 Tue Jun 7 09:00:32 UTC 2005 i686 GNU/Linux
2005-06-25T12:14:00.000Z	RobNyc		installed the i686 kernel
2005-06-25T12:14:00.000Z	RobNyc		but it seems the i386 maybe runs faster
2005-06-25T12:14:00.000Z	RobNyc		i mean pc runs faster with i386 2.6.10 maybe than the i686 2.6.10 ?
2005-06-25T12:15:00.000Z	RobNyc		anyone seen difference between 2.6.10-i386 and 2.6.10-i686 ?
2005-06-25T12:16:00.000Z	crimsun	RobNyc	the latter has highmem support, for starters
2006-05-31T11:37:00.000Z	crimsun	RobNyc	in dapper we use smp alternatives, which does detection at boot time.
2006-05-31T11:37:00.000Z	crimsun	RobNyc	thus there's no need to have separate -smp flavours. They're all smp enabled.
2006-05-31T11:40:00.000Z	crimsun	RobNyc	getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN
2006-05-31T11:41:00.000Z	RobNyc	crimsun	*
2006-05-31T11:41:00.000Z	crimsun	RobNyc	at a terminal
2006-05-31T11:43:00.000Z	RobNyc	crimsun	it showed
2006-05-31T11:43:00.000Z	crimsun	RobNyc	and uname -r ?
2006-05-31T11:44:00.000Z	crimsun	RobNyc	so install -686
2006-05-31T11:44:00.000Z	RobNyc	crimsun	alright
2006-05-31T11:54:00.000Z	RobNyc	crimsun	i searched for linux-686 and i saw the linux-686-smp kernels now
2006-05-31T11:54:00.000Z	crimsun	RobNyc	they're just placeholders
2006-05-31T11:54:00.000Z	crimsun	RobNyc	crimsun@garnish:~$ uname -r
2006-12-04T08:54:00.000Z	crimsun	RobNyc	topic.
