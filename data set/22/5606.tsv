2007-04-04T05:08:00.000Z	Arta		Hello
2007-04-04T05:09:00.000Z	Arta		I have a quick question if anyone's willing: I've just switched to ubuntu from windows, and divx playback is *terrible* -- really blocky
2007-04-04T05:09:00.000Z	Arta		Is there something better than the method suggested in the ubuntu docs for getting multimedia stuff going?
2007-04-04T05:09:00.000Z	oxygenws	Arta	hi :D download easyubuntu and have fun :>
2007-04-04T05:09:00.000Z	Arta		easyubuntu?
2007-04-04T05:10:00.000Z	Arta		Aha
2007-04-04T05:10:00.000Z	Arta		Thanks, shall have a read
2007-04-04T05:10:00.000Z	oxygenws	Arta	google it
2007-04-04T05:11:00.000Z	oxygenws	Arta	download this and install: http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/files/easyubuntu_latest.deb
2007-04-04T05:13:00.000Z	Arta		hmm, fglrx supports 3D accelleration, right?
2007-04-04T05:32:00.000Z	Arta		hmm -- not much better. I think easyubuntu was installing the same things that the ubuntu docs tell you to?
2007-04-04T05:33:00.000Z	oxygenws	Arta	i used that for a long time and it works amazing for me.
2007-04-04T05:33:00.000Z	Arta		Ok
2007-04-04T05:33:00.000Z	Arta		Perhaps It's just me :(
2007-04-04T05:33:00.000Z	oxygenws	Arta	did you install it?
2007-04-04T05:33:00.000Z	Arta		which?
2007-04-04T05:34:00.000Z	oxygenws	Arta	easyubuntu
2007-04-04T05:34:00.000Z	Arta		Yup: Installed easyubuntu and then used that to install multimedia codecs
2007-04-04T05:35:00.000Z	Arta		But I think it installed the same things that this tells you to: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/codecs.html
2007-04-04T05:35:00.000Z	oxygenws	Arta	please install VLC too, and play your movies with VLC. then try MPlayer
2007-04-04T05:35:00.000Z	Arta		Ok, will do -- did try that yesterday but their repository was down
2007-04-04T05:39:00.000Z	Arta	oxygenws	VLC repository is still not working properly -- "Failed to fetch ftp://ftp.videolan.org/[...] /Packages.gz  Unable to fetch file, server said `Packages.gz: No such file or directory  "
