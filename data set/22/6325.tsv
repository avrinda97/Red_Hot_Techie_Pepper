2006-11-10T16:26:00.000Z	trondare		hm, after enabling compiz i can't login to gnome, anyone know how to get back to metacity again?
2006-11-10T16:27:00.000Z	neil__	trondare	choose gnome failsafe from the sessions menu of the greeter
2006-11-10T16:27:00.000Z	neil__	trondare	then you can fix the startup in your session
2006-11-10T16:27:00.000Z	trondare	neil__	ok, will try that, thanks
2006-11-10T16:28:00.000Z	trondare	neil__	not even failsafe gnome works :(
2006-11-10T16:29:00.000Z	trondare	neil__	the command i used was 'compiz --replace --indirect-rendering --strict-binding'
2006-11-10T16:29:00.000Z	neil__	trondare	i've never broken gnome that much. sorry, i can't help more
2006-11-10T16:30:00.000Z	neil__	trondare	and you didn't put it into your session startup programs?
2006-11-10T16:31:00.000Z	neil__	trondare	you probably forgot to add "gconf" to the end of the command
2006-11-10T16:31:00.000Z	trondare	neil__	no, gconf was there as well
2006-11-10T16:34:00.000Z	neil__	trondare	you might find something relating to compiz in ~/.config/autostart/
2006-11-10T16:34:00.000Z	trondare	neil__	will check that now
2006-11-10T16:34:00.000Z	trondare	neil__	no autostart in there
2006-11-10T16:35:00.000Z	neil__	trondare	where did you put the compiz command?
2006-11-10T16:35:00.000Z	trondare	neil__	in a terminal
2006-11-10T16:35:00.000Z	neil__	trondare	then i can't see that it would have broken gnome permanently
2006-11-10T16:36:00.000Z	trondare	neil__	neither can i, but so it did :)
2006-11-10T16:37:00.000Z	neil__	trondare	that's what i've been looking for
2006-11-10T16:38:00.000Z	neil__	trondare	does your .xsession-errors file give any clue?
2006-11-10T16:39:00.000Z	trondare	neil__	nope :(
2006-11-10T16:39:00.000Z	trondare	neil__	gnome-settings-daemon starts, but nothing happens after that
2006-11-10T16:54:00.000Z	neil__	trondare	well done
