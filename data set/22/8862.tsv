2005-05-04T11:19:00.000Z	ircbot_		okay everyone... seeing as the ops aren't doing shit... just put him on ignore and he will leave
2005-05-04T11:19:00.000Z	ircbot_		don't encourage the trolls
2005-05-04T11:19:00.000Z	ircbot_		and WHERE ARE THE FUCKING OPS
2005-05-04T11:21:00.000Z	ircbot_		i mean i have respect for the ops and the CoC, and i also like the allowance of off topic conversation, but sometimes we need ops
2005-05-04T11:21:00.000Z	ircbot_		#freebsd pulls it off nicely
2005-05-04T11:21:00.000Z	ircbot_		number one reason for divorce... marriage
2005-05-04T11:22:00.000Z	ircbot_		#gentoo doesn't really allow that much off topic stuff... #freebsd is pretty free range until people need help
2005-05-04T11:22:00.000Z	ircbot_		brb making sandwiches
2005-05-04T11:22:00.000Z	travail101	ircbot_	I talk off topic in there all the time... some people say come on guys, that's off topic, but i've never been booted
2005-05-04T11:23:00.000Z	ircbot_	travail101	i've never been kicked, but i usually see the conversation get stopped before it comes to kicking
2005-05-04T11:25:00.000Z	travail101	ircbot_	why not gentoo for the server?
2005-05-04T11:26:00.000Z	ircbot_	travail101	because it's only got 633mghz and 32 ram (gonna up it for 256megs soon)
2005-05-04T11:26:00.000Z	ircbot_	travail101	and i don't want my server offline for 3 days
2005-05-04T11:26:00.000Z	travail101	ircbot_	GRP
2005-05-04T11:26:00.000Z	travail101	ircbot_	precompiled binaries
2005-05-04T11:27:00.000Z	travail101	ircbot_	on a handy CD
2005-05-04T11:27:00.000Z	travail101	ircbot_	emerge --usepkg
2005-05-04T11:27:00.000Z	ircbot_	travail101	wouldn't help with that first sync and some of the other stuff
2005-05-04T11:27:00.000Z	travail101	ircbot_	webrsync
2005-05-04T11:27:00.000Z	travail101	ircbot_	GRP installs are designed to get a complete system installed without a network connection
2005-05-04T11:28:00.000Z	ircbot_	travail101	it's not happening heh... ima bsd it soon though... which i like over gentoo
2005-05-04T11:28:00.000Z	travail101	ircbot_	well i can't argue against bsd ;-)
