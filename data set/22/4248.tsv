2008-02-27T02:00:00.000Z	AstorZZZ		You know, i need an ide where i can ACTUALLY compile a hello world app
2008-02-27T02:02:00.000Z	DRebellion_	AstorZZZ	you tried vim and g++?
2008-02-27T02:02:00.000Z	DRebellion_	AstorZZZ	yes!
2008-02-27T02:03:00.000Z	DRebellion_	AstorZZZ	:O
2008-02-27T02:04:00.000Z	DRebellion_	AstorZZZ	gdb?
2008-02-27T02:05:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	DRebellion_	i have no clue how to get it running
2008-02-27T02:05:00.000Z	DRebellion_	AstorZZZ	mind pasting it?
2008-02-27T02:09:00.000Z	DRebellion_	AstorZZZ	how to run it? open up a terminal and type ./nameofprogram
2008-02-27T02:09:00.000Z	DRebellion_	AstorZZZ	use cd to get to the correct folder first of course
2008-02-27T02:11:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	DRebellion_	except there's no executable there
2008-02-27T02:12:00.000Z	DRebellion_	AstorZZZ	I have no idea how to use anjuta. I can tell you that you should use  g++ code.cpp -o nameofprogram and then ./nameofprogram.
2008-02-27T02:12:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	DRebellion_	And how do i debug it?
2008-02-27T02:12:00.000Z	DRebellion_	AstorZZZ	you need to debug a helloworld app? what exactly is the error message you receive?
2008-02-27T02:13:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	DRebellion_	How can i compile a opengl app with g++?
2008-02-27T02:13:00.000Z	DRebellion_	AstorZZZ	look up some opengl c++ tutorials on the net or buy/rent a book
2008-02-27T02:13:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	DRebellion_	hell, no, i expect to proceed with more complex apps, how do i debug em?
2008-02-27T02:14:00.000Z	DRebellion_	AstorZZZ	perhaps you should learn gdb
2008-02-27T02:14:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	DRebellion_	usually books dont cover compiling opengl apps with g++ from terminal
