2005-09-20T15:04:00.000Z	Krille		and feather
2005-09-20T15:05:00.000Z	Krille		can someone give me an IP that leads to a web page ?
2005-09-20T15:05:00.000Z	Krille		i want to see if my DNS is fishy
2005-09-20T15:05:00.000Z	Jowi	Krille	216.239.59.99 (gooogle)
2005-09-20T15:07:00.000Z	Jowi	Krille	when did it stop working?
2005-09-20T15:08:00.000Z	Krille	Jowi	seems i cant connect to google, thats it
2005-09-20T15:08:00.000Z	Jowi	Krille	lol
2005-09-20T15:09:00.000Z	Jowi	Krille	you can't even ping local machines (if you're behind a router)?
2005-09-20T15:11:00.000Z	Krille	Jowi	the google-thing and the ubuntu-thing are two different things really
2005-09-20T15:11:00.000Z	Jowi	Krille	yeah, i understood that :-)
2005-09-20T15:13:00.000Z	Jowi	Krille	well, run sudo network-admin. if your NIC can be seen there try to deactivate + activate. if your NIC is not there maybe you had an overload on the mobo....?
2005-09-20T15:15:00.000Z	Jowi	Krille	just try sudo network-admin first. see what happens.
2005-09-20T15:15:00.000Z	Krille	Jowi	ok hang on
2005-09-20T15:16:00.000Z	Jowi	Krille	ctrl-alt-backspace always restart X.
2005-09-20T15:18:00.000Z	Jowi	Krille	...so gnome hangs when you try to log in now?
2005-09-20T15:22:00.000Z	Jowi	Krille	network-admin only works graphically :-/
2005-09-20T15:23:00.000Z	Jowi	Krille	if you want to remove ALL your gnome-settings and have nothing to loose you can do it like this: log in where you are (not graphically) and type rm -rf .gnome* (note the period before gnome)
2005-09-20T15:24:00.000Z	Jowi	Krille	then do ALT-F7 and log in normally, that will re-create all gnome settings as if you logged in for the first time
2005-09-20T15:45:00.000Z	Jowi	Krille	since the live-cd's produce the same faults I would consider the posibility that the mobo is faulty after you kicked the powercord... just a pessimistic though :-/
2005-09-20T15:48:00.000Z	Jowi	Krille	ah, before I leave just a thing you can test: set a static IP
2005-09-20T15:48:00.000Z	Krille	Jowi	its not unrealistic actually. I dont know how the electrical system behaves for you yanks, but here you can sometimes have 220v connections (the one without any power supply, just that cable) that sort of ... hmm makes a "crackling" noise when you insert it and its not totally "straight" or "in" ....
2005-09-20T15:50:00.000Z	Jowi	Krille	a yank like me lives in France, but i am Swedish! haha. my powersupply crackles a bit as well when i put it in. no worries about that. anyway. I would try to set a static IP on the NiC before giving up on it :-) g'night all!
