2006-04-13T13:42:00.000Z	megaman123		no one familiar with DVB and ubuntu here ??
2006-04-13T13:44:00.000Z	arrinmurr	megaman123	well, i'm using dvb with kaffeine
2006-04-13T13:46:00.000Z	megaman123	arrinmurr	what dvb card do you have?
2006-04-13T13:47:00.000Z	arrinmurr	megaman123	Terratec Cinergy 1200 DVB-C
2006-04-13T13:47:00.000Z	megaman123	arrinmurr	i got it to scan but when i try to open xine it gives me a demux error
2006-04-13T13:48:00.000Z	arrinmurr	megaman123	you got what to scan?
2006-04-13T13:48:00.000Z	megaman123	arrinmurr	i got it to scan Hotbird and got the channels.conf
2006-04-13T13:49:00.000Z	megaman123	arrinmurr	and i get the szap to run
2006-04-13T13:49:00.000Z	arrinmurr	megaman123	hmm.. i  haven't really used the separate small utilities for scanning etc. for a long time, since kaffeine does it all
2006-04-13T13:50:00.000Z	megaman123	arrinmurr	what pre-req's do i need to have installed ??
2006-04-13T13:51:00.000Z	megaman123	arrinmurr	or do i find it in Synaptic??
2006-04-13T13:51:00.000Z	arrinmurr	megaman123	it brings everything it needs with it when it's being installed
2006-04-13T13:51:00.000Z	arrinmurr	megaman123	yes
2006-04-13T13:51:00.000Z	megaman123	arrinmurr	nice :)))
2006-04-13T13:52:00.000Z	arrinmurr	megaman123	but it's a kde program, so it will bring so kde libraries with it. it worth it though, unless you're going to make a pvr box or something, in which case something like mythtv or vdr would be better
2006-04-13T13:53:00.000Z	megaman123	arrinmurr	i can not get either of them to work :( been at it for the last 72 hours non stop
2006-04-13T13:54:00.000Z	arrinmurr	megaman123	yeah, kaffeine is like a heaven compared to them in that sense ;)
2006-04-13T13:55:00.000Z	megaman123	arrinmurr	i'll give it a try..i still have like 30 mins of updates to go
2006-04-13T13:56:00.000Z	arrinmurr	megaman123	but kaffeine is not a media center like mythtv, but just a media player with great dvb capabilities
2006-04-13T13:56:00.000Z	megaman123	arrinmurr	i will settle for anything that gives me dvb picture for now
2006-04-13T13:57:00.000Z	megaman123	arrinmurr	i'm telling u i've been trying to set vdr up for the last 3 days and i'm done
2006-04-13T13:57:00.000Z	arrinmurr	megaman123	hehe :)
