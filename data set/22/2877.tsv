2011-05-01T17:59:00.000Z	NickUK`		That's the thing I know I'm not upto date
2011-05-01T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	NickUK`	how?
2011-05-01T17:59:00.000Z	NickUK`		If I plug my BootUSB into my laptop and run Update-Manager it tells me there is an update and trys to install it from the USB.
2011-05-01T17:59:00.000Z	NickUK`		But for some reason it chucks errors at me, I cannot install from the USB as the screen turns like static you get from a TV but it doesn't move.
2011-05-01T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	NickUK`	what update?  Do « apt-cache policy PACKAGE » on the package
2011-05-01T18:00:00.000Z	NickUK`	jrib	- Can I pm you I can't read while everyone else is chatting and logging in/out of IRC
2011-05-01T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	NickUK`	if you must, but I'd prefer it if we stayed in channel (just read the highlighted text and ignore the rest)
