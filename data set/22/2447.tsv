2009-06-06T16:51:00.000Z	airbender	_spiff	for CIFS, there is a _netdev option to check if the net file system is up or not.
2009-06-06T16:51:00.000Z	airbender	_spiff	I am not sure of NFS has that option or not.
2009-06-06T16:52:00.000Z	_spiff	airbender	Hmm, an option for what. Does it go in /etc/fstab, or somewhere else?
2009-06-06T16:53:00.000Z	airbender	_spiff	should work fine under fstab.
2009-06-06T16:53:00.000Z	airbender	_spiff	just check if that option exists for NFS or not.
2009-06-06T16:55:00.000Z	_spiff	airbender	But if it is in fstab, how would X know not to start? My problem is not that home does not get mounted, but that it is not mounted at the time I log in.
2009-06-06T16:56:00.000Z	airbender	_spiff	then create a session under gnome and manually mount the folder again?
2009-06-06T16:57:00.000Z	airbender	_spiff	create a auto run session for gnome and let it run when you login
2009-06-06T16:59:00.000Z	airbender	_spiff	working?
2009-06-06T17:01:00.000Z	_spiff	airbender	I would rather have the init-script (which does the mount) wait until the mount is done, before starting X. I have been running Gentoo for years, and recently switched to Ubuntu on my desktop. Never had this problem before.
2009-06-06T17:02:00.000Z	airbender	_spiff	that's what I talked about. See if there is an option for networking delay like _netdev (network device), and you are good to go
2009-06-06T17:03:00.000Z	_spiff	airbender	Ahh, OK. I didn't realize that was what would happen from putting it in /etc/fstab. Thanks, I will check it out.
2009-06-06T17:03:00.000Z	airbender	_spiff	good luck
2009-06-06T17:07:00.000Z	airbender	_spiff	http://linux.die.net/man/5/nfs  maybe the timeout parameter will work. I guess.
2009-06-06T17:07:00.000Z	_spiff	airbender	I found /etc/inid.d/mountnfs.sh, which seems to do what I want, but perhaps I need to move gdm from S30 to some later point.
2009-06-06T17:07:00.000Z	airbender	_spiff	good point.
2009-06-06T17:12:00.000Z	_spiff	airbender	Will try to reboot and see if it works. Thanks so far!
2009-06-06T17:32:00.000Z	_spiff	airbender	Hmm. That didn't work. I tried putting mountnfs.sh at S29. It appears that _netdev is valid for nfs, but AFAICT it delays mounting the nfs until after the network is configured, not delaying the script until the mount is done.
2009-06-06T17:33:00.000Z	airbender	_spiff	you said you'd delay gdm script.
2009-06-06T17:34:00.000Z	airbender	_spiff	or change time out parameter for NFS?
2009-06-06T17:35:00.000Z	_spiff	airbender	Yeah, and I thought that would be done by putting mountnfs.sh at S29 and leaving gdm at S30. The whole idea of mountnfs.sh should be to delay the startup process until the devices are mounted.
2009-06-06T17:36:00.000Z	airbender	_spiff	or it will be just easier that you create a session under gnome, and let it remount the NFS when starting gnome. It'll be easier
