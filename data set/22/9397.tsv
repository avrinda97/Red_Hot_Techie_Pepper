2004-11-15T10:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	janice	the /etc/fstab file :)
2004-11-15T12:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	janice	jdub knows - follow his advice :)
2004-11-15T12:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	janice	not necessary, but possibly simpler unless you want to go into esoteric stuff... you have removed your user so the system doesn't see you as authorised to use sudo
2004-11-15T12:24:00.000Z	janice	thoreauputic	It sure was easy to do. (uh).
2004-11-15T12:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	janice	what? removing your user or installing ? :)
2004-11-17T12:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	janice	I suggest you see what /etc/network/interfaces says on the working live Cd, and copy that
2004-11-17T12:51:00.000Z	janice	thoreauputic	That is a very logical suggestion. I will try it.
2004-11-17T12:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	janice	can't hurt, anyway ;)
2004-11-17T12:56:00.000Z	janice	thoreauputic	after rebooting with the liveCD, the /etc/network/interfaces is blank except for two comment (#) lines.
2004-11-17T12:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	janice	and yet it works? very strange...
2004-11-17T13:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	janice	maybe check and compare the output of ifconfig to see what it is recognising
2004-11-17T13:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	janice	is this a cable connection? dsl?
2004-11-17T13:01:00.000Z	janice	thoreauputic	check with liveCD or boot into installed ubuntu?
2004-11-17T13:01:00.000Z	janice	thoreauputic	dsl
2004-11-17T13:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	janice	have you tried pppoeconfig?
2004-11-17T13:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	janice	sorry pppoeconf
2004-11-17T13:05:00.000Z	janice	thoreauputic	I think the ifconfig has given a clue to the problem. Ubuntu LiveCD is using eth1 for the internet connectivity; however, the installed Unbuntu is trying to use eth0.
2004-11-17T13:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	janice	aha - that would be it I suspect
2004-11-17T13:06:00.000Z	janice	thoreauputic	miral: I will reboot into installed ubuntu and try to change the network setting to eth1
2004-11-17T13:19:00.000Z	janice	thoreauputic	and mirak: I got it working. What I did was moved the ethernet cable to the alternate ethernet port (the motherboard has two built in ethernet jacks). However, there still wasn't internet connectivity. Using the networking GUI interface, I deleted the eth0 device and re-added it again. This seemed to reinitialize the device and internet connectivity began to work.
2004-11-17T13:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	janice	well done then :)
2004-11-17T13:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	janice	you're very welcome :)
