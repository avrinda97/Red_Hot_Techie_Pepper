2008-12-09T09:10:00.000Z	rww	Panarchy	you'll lose all your GNOME settings that way, not just the panel settings
2008-12-09T09:11:00.000Z	rww	Panarchy	try http://www.celsius1414.com/node/878 instead, perhaps? it seems to be more targeted
2008-12-09T09:15:00.000Z	rww	Panarchy	log out and log back in?
2008-12-09T09:15:00.000Z	rww	Panarchy	or "killall gnome-panel" maybe
2008-12-09T09:15:00.000Z	rww	Panarchy	it should automatically come back
2008-12-09T09:51:00.000Z	rww	Panarchy	what's the output of lsb_release -a?
2008-12-20T14:29:00.000Z	rww	Panarchy	cp -R source destination
2009-01-17T08:09:00.000Z	rww	Panarchy	You're missing the package human-icon-theme. Either install ubuntu-desktop to get that and other stuff, or install just the package and change your icon theme in Appearance Preferences.
2009-01-17T16:02:00.000Z	rww	Panarchy	and for some light, related, reading material, install the package ubuntu-artwork and read /usr/share/doc/ubuntu-artwork/copyright. If you're planning on redistributing Ubuntu stuff, have your lawyer read it too.
