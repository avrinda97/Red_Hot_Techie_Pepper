2006-11-19T07:44:00.000Z	Super_K		Im in Partition Magic right now, and wish to know what happens if I delete the Linux and Linux Swap partition. Will I just need to fix MBR?
2006-11-19T07:45:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	if you are going to have to fix the mbr, then don't delete them in the first place
2006-11-19T07:45:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	what are you trying to do?
2006-11-19T07:47:00.000Z	Super_K	sethk	I must delete linux
2006-11-19T07:47:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	why?  and, if so, what exactly do you think you would be fixing in the mbr?
2006-11-19T07:48:00.000Z	Super_K	sethk	I just want windows for now, I need those partitions, and I would need to fix mbr because GRUB is installed as master, right?
2006-11-19T07:48:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	no
2006-11-19T07:48:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	well, not as you wrote it
2006-11-19T07:48:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	you can install the windows boot loader which will cover up grub.  that will happen automatically if you do a windows install, or you can do it manually
2006-11-19T07:49:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	but that doesn't really have any interaction with the partitions, other than sharing the same sector
2006-11-19T07:49:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	you don't have to delete partitions to lose grub
2006-11-19T07:49:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	ok, that's a separate issue
2006-11-19T07:50:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	if you want the space, take the space, but it has no impact on installing the windows boot loader over grub
2006-11-19T07:50:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	I think what you are asking is, will grub stop working if you delete linux, and the answer is yes, if you have a typical isntallation
2006-11-19T07:50:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	if by "repair the mbr" you mean install the windows boot loader, then yes.
2006-11-19T07:50:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	I know, I'm just clearing up what interacts with what
2006-11-19T07:53:00.000Z	Super_K	sethk	can I fix MBR without the disc? Maybe a batch file on a usb of some sort?
2006-11-19T07:54:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	if you haven't killed linux yet, you can
2006-11-19T07:54:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	you can boot window, and then use windows to install the windows boot loader
2006-11-19T07:55:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	if you've already killed linux, you'll need a bootable cd (well, media) of some sort
2006-11-19T07:57:00.000Z	Super_K	sethk	these I assume?
2006-11-19T07:57:00.000Z	sethk	Super_K	that looks promising, definitely
