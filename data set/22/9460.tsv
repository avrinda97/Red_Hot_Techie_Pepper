2004-11-02T07:33:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	clochejm	cat /etc/resolv.conf
2004-11-02T07:34:00.000Z	clochejm	jgeorgeson	I already have it open... it has the same dns entries as windows does (windows works fine)
2004-11-02T07:34:00.000Z	clochejm	jgeorgeson	it's very strange behavior
2004-11-02T07:35:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	clochejm	so if you run 'host www.yahoo.dns' does it take longer to get a result than 'nslookup www.yahoo.com' in windows?
2004-11-02T07:36:00.000Z	clochejm	jgeorgeson	it actually returns the address pretty quickly
2004-11-02T07:37:00.000Z	clochejm	jgeorgeson	a site takes 20 times to start loading than it took to return the ips
2004-11-02T07:37:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	clochejm	so dns seems to be working fine. what browser are you using?
2004-11-02T07:37:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	clochejm	hm ...
2004-11-02T07:37:00.000Z	clochejm	jgeorgeson	I"m trying in mozilla... same result
2004-11-02T07:38:00.000Z	clochejm	jgeorgeson	I hit enter on www.google.com 20 seconds ago and it's still staying "resolving..."
2004-11-02T07:38:00.000Z	clochejm	jgeorgeson	is there another layer?
2004-11-02T07:40:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	clochejm	not that i'm a aware of. do you have a proxy configured in firefox? do you only get this lag in firefox?
2004-11-02T07:40:00.000Z	clochejm	jgeorgeson	it's the same in mozilla
2004-11-02T07:41:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	clochejm	well, they both use the gecko engine, so that might not be a good comparison
2004-11-02T07:41:00.000Z	clochejm	jgeorgeson	that's what I was thinking...
2004-11-02T07:41:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	clochejm	what about lynx/elinks/links, ftp, etc
2004-11-02T07:41:00.000Z	clochejm	jgeorgeson	I'll give links a try quiclk
2004-11-02T07:43:00.000Z	clochejm	jgeorgeson	well..the package manager takes a while to start as well
2004-11-02T07:43:00.000Z	clochejm	jgeorgeson	elinks took a while "looking up host"
2004-11-02T07:45:00.000Z	clochejm	jgeorgeson	firefox is set to direct connection
2004-11-02T07:47:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	clochejm	hm, i'm kinda stumped
2004-11-02T07:47:00.000Z	clochejm	jgeorgeson	yeah...me too...this is very strange... I've never had problems with other distros
