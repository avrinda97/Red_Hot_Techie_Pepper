2011-12-10T00:16:00.000Z	Amon-Ra	Ricklee	did u observe if it stops when it scans for cd-rom during installation ? actually if it says that installation completed immediately after
2011-12-10T00:18:00.000Z	Ricklee		Didn't see I have tried to install  4 times now with 3 different cds
2011-12-10T00:18:00.000Z	Amon-Ra		i hade  the same symptoms with 64 bit version
2011-12-10T00:19:00.000Z	Amon-Ra	Ricklee	re-install and check if during installation where it display the information (copying, installing etc) if it says "scanning cd-rom" and if the installation completes immediately after
2011-12-10T00:19:00.000Z	Ricklee		Ok one sec
2011-12-10T00:20:00.000Z	Amon-Ra	Ricklee	if it completes immediately after we faced the same issue...because the installations has more steps to do after "scanning cd-rom"
2011-12-10T00:21:00.000Z	Ricklee		How do I fix it?
2011-12-10T00:21:00.000Z	Ricklee		And no its not a new comp
2011-12-10T00:21:00.000Z	Amon-Ra		i just installed 11.04 , 64 bit which installed normally, and now i upgrade to 11.10
2011-12-10T00:22:00.000Z	Ricklee		I've had ubuntu bunch installed on this same comp bfore with no errors
2011-12-10T00:22:00.000Z	Amon-Ra		in case that it the same issue..but i had the same symptoms with your case
2011-12-10T00:25:00.000Z	Ricklee	Amon-Ra	what should I do if it is the cd rom error
