2005-10-14T16:48:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		sam2 yes
2005-10-14T16:48:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		guys? anyone know how to change the computers workgroup? i had done it but i have forgotten
2005-10-14T16:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	ThePyromaniac	look maybe in system -> admin -> networking -> general
2005-10-14T16:49:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac	HappyFool	that has PC name and domain
2005-10-14T16:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	ThePyromaniac	if there's no workgroup entry there, you'll need to edit smb.conf
2005-10-14T16:49:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac	HappyFool	i want the workgroup, but thanks mate :D
2005-10-14T16:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	ThePyromaniac	yeah, the wiki shows a different dialog box, which i don't get either.
2005-10-14T05:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	ThePyromaniac	i don't think that is correct; you don't need fat32 for samba
2005-10-15T11:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	ThePyromaniac	try installing python2.3
2005-10-15T11:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	ThePyromaniac	'sudo apt-get install python2.3'
2005-10-15T11:34:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac	HappyFool	says "Version of python on system is 2.4.2-0ubuntu2." when iretry the deb file
2005-10-15T11:35:00.000Z	HappyFool	ThePyromaniac	have you installed the python2.3 package? If you have and it still doesn't work, I guess that deb is not ubuntu-compatible
2005-10-15T11:37:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac	HappyFool	i have 2.4 apparently and it need 2.4
2005-10-15T11:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	ThePyromaniac	you need 2.3, from what you said earlier
2005-10-15T11:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	ThePyromaniac	then my guess is that .deb is not ubuntu-compatible
2005-10-15T11:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	ThePyromaniac	have you tried 'sudo apt-get install visualboyadvance' ?
2005-10-15T12:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	ThePyromaniac	try #python
2005-10-15T12:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	ThePyromaniac	check the precise version requirements for this app
2005-10-15T12:52:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac	HappyFool	aww, but its a problem with installing gnomeboyadvance lol. why does every program installation take me 3 hours?
2005-10-15T12:53:00.000Z	HappyFool	ThePyromaniac	all i can suggest is asking in #python
2005-10-15T12:57:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac	HappyFool	turns out its just cause i didnt fill in the path to visualboyadvance package. where would that be...
