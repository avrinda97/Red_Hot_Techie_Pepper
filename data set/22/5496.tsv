2007-04-23T09:05:00.000Z	SRed13		OK, Linux did not detect my wireless card on install.
2007-04-23T09:05:00.000Z	SRed13		I did iwconfig and it responds "No wireless extensions"
2007-04-23T09:06:00.000Z	bamafram	SRed13	what kind of video card?
2007-04-23T09:06:00.000Z	bamafram		errr
2007-04-23T09:06:00.000Z	bamafram		wireless card* :)
2007-04-23T09:06:00.000Z	SRed13		It is a DLink card
2007-04-23T09:07:00.000Z	bamafram	SRed13	that doesn't narrow it down much :)
2007-04-23T09:07:00.000Z	SRed13		DLink Wirelss G
2007-04-23T09:08:00.000Z	bamafram	SRed13	: Model number?
2007-04-23T09:08:00.000Z	SRed13	bamafram	is there an easy way for me to find out?  LIke a linux device manager?
2007-04-23T09:08:00.000Z	bamafram		lspci from the terminal
2007-04-23T09:08:00.000Z	bamafram		ther'es probably a GUI way to do it, but that's the fastest way I know
2007-04-23T09:08:00.000Z	bamafram		well, actually if it's a USB dongle, lsusb instead
2007-04-23T09:09:00.000Z	SRed13	bamafram	its a wireless card, not a dongle, and I don't have the gui installed
2007-04-23T09:09:00.000Z	bamafram	SRed13	you're chatting from the console?  Either way it's still "lspci"
2007-04-23T09:10:00.000Z	SRed13		bama, I'm running my windows laptop literally on top of the linux box
2007-04-23T09:11:00.000Z	SRed13		Bama, Atheros communications, inc AR5215 802.11abg NIC card
2007-04-23T09:12:00.000Z	bamafram	SRed13	I don't see why it matters.  If Ubuntu is at a part where you can click or type, you can get to a terminal.  If you have a GUI, it's Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal.  If you're at a "DOS" console, it's just "lspci"
2007-04-23T09:12:00.000Z	SRed13		its a dlink card, I guess atheros produces for them
2007-04-23T09:12:00.000Z	SRed13		Bamafram, I used lspci, "Ethernet controller: Atheros communication, inc. 145212 802.11 NIC rev 1"
2007-04-23T09:13:00.000Z	SRed13		Its actually a wi-fi, not ethernet card though
2007-04-23T09:15:00.000Z	bamafram	SRed13	what about ndiswrapper?
