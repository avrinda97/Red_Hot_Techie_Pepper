2009-03-17T22:22:00.000Z	nigtv		hello
2009-03-17T22:24:00.000Z	nigtv		i am currently installing xubuntu 7.10 onto a small workstation computer, and i could install ubuntu 7.10, or any other version if needed. I wanted to put snes9x (or zsnes, really), and have it boot DIRECTLY into that emulator, i have searched around all over, tried editing all of the bashrc and bashprofile files, changing init.d, etc, and havent gotten anything to work
2009-03-17T22:24:00.000Z	nigtv		i really need someone to help me because i am totally lost now
