2005-06-12T16:25:00.000Z	pedlar		hey, anybody tell me why i can't get gstreamer0.8-lame on an amd64 version of hoary?
2005-06-12T16:26:00.000Z	pedlar		no, i'm not
2005-06-12T16:26:00.000Z	pedlar		is there any way i could build it myself?
2005-06-12T16:28:00.000Z	pedlar		so could anybody help me with building gstreamer0.8-lame?
2005-06-12T16:28:00.000Z	kent	pedlar	why build it?
2005-06-12T16:30:00.000Z	kent	pedlar	if its not in the ubuntu archive, its probably becaus it didn't compile.  But, if your using Hoary it should be in the archive. Are you using restricted and universe?
2005-06-12T16:32:00.000Z	kent	pedlar	there is no package with the name gstreamer0.8-lame.  I cant find it either.
2005-06-12T16:32:00.000Z	kent	pedlar	and im using i386
2005-06-12T16:33:00.000Z	kent	pedlar	what made you think that there should exist such a package by the way? maybe its called something else?
2005-06-12T16:33:00.000Z	pedlar	kent	the ubuntu docs made me think it exists
2005-06-12T16:34:00.000Z	kent	pedlar	which doc? could you point me to that page?
2005-06-12T16:35:00.000Z	kent	pedlar	gstreamer0.8-mad  will give you mp3 support, if thats the package you are looking for.. ?
2005-06-12T16:36:00.000Z	pedlar	kent	i'm looking for encoding
2005-06-12T16:36:00.000Z	pedlar	kent	i've already gotten the mad package, they play fine
2005-06-12T16:37:00.000Z	kent	pedlar	if you read more carefully it says on that page that it is in Hoary-extras.  I dont know where that repositorie is :(
2005-06-12T16:38:00.000Z	kent	pedlar	section 2.2 on that page will tell you how to configure so that you get the hoary-extra repositorie. After that, you can install gstreamer0.8-lame  :)
2005-06-12T16:42:00.000Z	kent	pedlar	it doesn't show at all, or it shows the wrong version?
2005-06-12T16:42:00.000Z	pedlar	kent	no show
2005-06-12T16:42:00.000Z	kent	pedlar	have you ran "sudo apt-get update" (or updated the list in synaptic) ?
2005-06-12T16:43:00.000Z	kent	pedlar	and you ran that *after* you added the hoary-extra  right?
2005-06-12T16:43:00.000Z	pedlar	kent	and just did it again
2005-06-12T05:04:00.000Z	kent	pedlar	that meen you should file a bug on bugzilla.ubuntu.com, perhaps?  or ask those who maintain hoary-extra :)
