2009-10-16T03:14:00.000Z	hedkandi		which repository is libdvdcss in?
2009-10-16T03:14:00.000Z	hedkandi		restricted?
2009-10-16T03:15:00.000Z	The_Doctor	hedkandi	Try adding the medibuntu repro.
2009-10-16T03:16:00.000Z	hedkandi	The_Doctor	you mean repository?
2009-10-16T03:16:00.000Z	The_Doctor	hedkandi	Yes
2009-10-16T03:16:00.000Z	The_Doctor	hedkandi	That has all the multimedia codecs.
2009-10-16T03:16:00.000Z	hedkandi	The_Doctor	what's the package name?
2009-10-16T03:17:00.000Z	The_Doctor	hedkandi	Its not a package, its a repository. Do a google search on how add it.
2009-10-16T03:18:00.000Z	hedkandi	The_Doctor	ooh yes you are right
2009-10-16T03:19:00.000Z	hedkandi	The_Doctor	there's a package in ubuntu called libdvdread4
2009-10-16T03:20:00.000Z	hedkandi		which claims to contain dvd descrambling
2009-10-16T03:20:00.000Z	hedkandi		but it seems to be screwy
2009-10-16T03:20:00.000Z	The_Doctor	hedkandi	but I am surprised that when you tried to play the media you are having trouble with, you were not presented with a choice to install the codecs.
2009-10-16T03:23:00.000Z	hedkandi		why not put the codecs into ubuntu restricted or multiverse then?
2009-10-16T03:23:00.000Z	The_Doctor	hedkandi	they should be there. What was your problem/
2009-10-16T03:24:00.000Z	The_Doctor	hedkandi	Why were you asking for the codec/
2009-10-16T03:24:00.000Z	hedkandi		ok
2009-10-16T03:25:00.000Z	hedkandi		there doesn't seem to be an i686 version of these media codecs!
2009-10-16T03:25:00.000Z	hedkandi		which I think is a bit serious
2009-10-16T03:25:00.000Z	hedkandi		because i686 is much better than i386
2009-10-16T03:25:00.000Z	hedkandi		?
2009-10-16T03:25:00.000Z	The_Doctor	hedkandi	yes there is. What made you think you needed them. What didn't work?
