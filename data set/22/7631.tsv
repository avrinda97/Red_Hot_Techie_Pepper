2006-05-31T15:55:00.000Z	YogSothoth		Hi
2006-05-31T15:55:00.000Z	YogSothoth		When I boot Ubuntu my Windows disk is auto detected and auto mounted... but as root ! So I can't read it
2006-05-31T15:55:00.000Z	YogSothoth		How can I tell Ubuntu to mount it as my user?
2006-05-31T15:57:00.000Z	ompaul	YogSothoth	change the entry in fstab to change the word defaults into ntfs user,umask=000
2006-05-31T15:58:00.000Z	ompaul	YogSothoth	/dev/hda1       /media/windows  ntfs    nls=utf8,ro,user,umask=000 0       0  <<< it should look like that
2006-05-31T05:02:00.000Z	YogSothoth	ompaul	actually my fstab looks like this: http://rafb.net/paste/results/GaO0U413.html
2006-05-31T05:03:00.000Z	YogSothoth	ompaul	is that good if I replace it with that: http://rafb.net/paste/results/mIqq1I46.html
2006-05-31T05:04:00.000Z	ompaul	YogSothoth	yuk use paste.ubuntu-nl.com and put into it the following information >> cat /etc/fstab ; mount ; sudo fdisk -l   << that is what I want and stop using rafb.net I can't edit that page and hand it back to you paste.ubuntu-nl.org works better
2006-05-31T05:04:00.000Z	ompaul	YogSothoth	that is .org not like .com as I wrote at the beginning
2006-05-31T05:09:00.000Z	YogSothoth	ompaul	pastebin, nopaste, and now ubuntu-paste... how can I remember what to use for each channel ?! :-)
2006-05-31T05:11:00.000Z	ompaul	YogSothoth	paste.ubuntu-nl.org works well most people just don't want rubbish in their channel - the one I am suggesting is rather friendly and all i want is a url if you do it in that one I can send you back a url by working directly on your paste
2006-05-31T05:13:00.000Z	YogSothoth	ompaul	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14901
2006-05-31T05:13:00.000Z	ompaul	YogSothoth	thanks, back in a couple of minutes
2006-05-31T05:14:00.000Z	YogSothoth	ompaul	thank *you*!
2006-05-31T05:14:00.000Z	ompaul	YogSothoth	tell me, you only have 2 CDs and 1 floppy?
2006-05-31T05:19:00.000Z	YogSothoth	ompaul	yes, one dvd-rom, one cd-r and one floppy
2006-05-31T05:21:00.000Z	ompaul	YogSothoth	sorry I had to take a call will do that now
2006-05-31T05:26:00.000Z	ompaul	YogSothoth	here is the way that file should look>>  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14904 << >> sudo nano /etc/fstab << put that data inthere, then run this command >> sudo mount -a
2006-05-31T05:26:00.000Z	ompaul	YogSothoth	it will work every time after that
2006-05-31T06:31:00.000Z	YogSothoth	ompaul	I reboot and see now
2006-06-01T06:47:00.000Z	YogSothoth	ompaul	Hi! I forgot to say thanx yesterday: the fstab file works perfect! I can now access my Windows disk without being root!
2006-06-01T06:48:00.000Z	ompaul	YogSothoth	no problem, glad it worked for you
