2007-07-23T10:53:00.000Z	jaw		once the   IP works, then   add in the dyndns element to the mix
2007-07-23T10:55:00.000Z	jaw		make sure you try a few others besides 80.
2007-07-23T10:56:00.000Z	balleyne	jaw	but that shouldn't cause problems on his local network, and he can't even access it from other local machines yet
2007-07-23T10:56:00.000Z	jaw	balleyne	oh. oops(!). didn't realize that
2007-07-23T10:57:00.000Z	balleyne	jaw	yeah, good point though, I didn't realize that but it makes sense
2007-07-23T11:04:00.000Z	jaw	balleyne	I'm doing the same with dyndns. Locally I can access the machine from within my network (i'm on port 3000, but I get Connection Refused when trying the same with nc
2007-07-23T11:05:00.000Z	jaw	balleyne	I'm allowing port 3000 in my router on udp/tcp and forwarding it to my local ip within the network... anything obvious I might be missing?
2007-07-23T11:09:00.000Z	jaw	balleyne	thanks, I run nc 71.97.xx.xx 3000 and get (Unknown) : connection refused
2007-07-23T11:23:00.000Z	balleyne	jaw	np - have you tried viewing by your ip address?
2007-07-23T11:24:00.000Z	balleyne	jaw	k, so it's most likely an issue with your router
2007-07-23T11:24:00.000Z	balleyne	jaw	have you set up port mapping on the router?
2007-07-23T11:26:00.000Z	balleyne	jaw	an your sure that 192.168.1.47 is listening on 3000?
2007-07-23T11:26:00.000Z	balleyne	jaw	right
2007-07-23T11:27:00.000Z	balleyne	jaw	hmm, well, it's probably an issue with the router and port mapping rather than dynDNS right now, because first it's gotta be working by IP...
2007-07-23T11:28:00.000Z	jaw	balleyne	yes... could it be with the loopback problem?
2007-07-23T11:28:00.000Z	balleyne	jaw	I'd double check the settings on your router... I've used a similar model, but at my gf's place, so I don't have access to check the admin interface myself
2007-07-23T11:28:00.000Z	balleyne	jaw	I'm not really familiar with loopback (or at least with the term)
2007-07-23T11:29:00.000Z	jaw	balleyne	what's odd is the router shows 2 ip's for this computer, as if a different network pool feeds the wireless connections from local connections. i though it was 192.168.1.102, but then it also looked like it was 192.168.1.47
2007-07-23T11:30:00.000Z	balleyne	jaw	hmm, that's strange... but 47 works locally, not 102, right? (for access the web server)
2007-07-23T11:31:00.000Z	balleyne	jaw	have you given the machine a static ip?
2007-07-23T11:31:00.000Z	jaw	balleyne	- no static ip, and something's going on with the 102 vs 47 bit
2007-07-23T11:32:00.000Z	balleyne	jaw	you may want to give a static ip anyways (whether from the machine's settings, or by creating a rule in the router admin based on the machine's MAC address)... I have no idea if that's related to the 47v102 thing though
