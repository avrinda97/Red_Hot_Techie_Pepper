2011-06-10T20:03:00.000Z	bad_alloc		Hello I'm running an old ubuntu 8.10 (compatability reasons) and i cannot connect to wireless networks. DHCPDISCOVER fails with any wifi-manager I've tried (network-manager, wifi-radar and rutilt) This is the output I get in terminal when running any of those wifi-programs: http://cxg.de/_df1114.htm  How do I fix this?

2011-06-10T20:04:00.000Z	pfifo	bad_alloc	can you paste bin 'iwconfig' and 'iwlist'
2011-06-10T20:06:00.000Z	bad_alloc	pfifo	sorry no, the notebook is currently somewhere else. But I can tell you that It's the dell intel chipset on wlan0 and an ALFA awus036H I'm using. neither works.
2011-06-10T20:06:00.000Z	bad_alloc	pfifo	not a hardware fault though, the parallel windows can use wifi
2011-06-10T20:07:00.000Z	pfifo	bad_alloc	to fix the dhcpdiscover error... connect to a network with a dhcp server
2011-06-10T20:08:00.000Z	bad_alloc	pfifo	the network definately has a dhcp server, as two other computers use that server. only this notebook fails at it.
2011-06-10T20:08:00.000Z	pfifo	bad_alloc	sounds like your unable to connect to that network
2011-06-10T20:10:00.000Z	bad_alloc	pfifo	yes. but why? do I have to deal with it™ or could you give me some pointers to further resources?
2011-06-10T20:11:00.000Z	pfifo	bad_alloc	use iwconfig and iwscan to try and connect manually
2011-06-10T20:11:00.000Z	pfifo	bad_alloc	see where it fails in that process
2011-06-10T20:12:00.000Z	bad_alloc	pfifo	ok thanks for your time :)
2011-06-10T20:13:00.000Z	pfifo	bad_alloc	ive heard other praise wicd for is ability to connect to wireless when nm fails
2011-06-10T20:13:00.000Z	bad_alloc	pfifo	I've tried to install that once on that particular machine. as a result I lost most of my network config stuff.
2011-06-10T20:14:00.000Z	pfifo	bad_alloc	well yeah its an entirely seprate system from NM
2011-06-10T20:15:00.000Z	bad_alloc	pfifo	do you know if the nvidia GeForce 8400 G is supported in newer verseions of ubuntu (10.04+)
2011-06-10T20:16:00.000Z	bad_alloc	pfifo	I'm using 8.10 because of alledgedly unavalibale drivers for that graphics card. (i.e. without them the fan doesn't work and the card idles at 80°C)
2011-06-10T20:16:00.000Z	pfifo	bad_alloc	the nvidia site shows which cards are supported by the current blob, it should be
2011-12-16T22:32:00.000Z	pfifo	bad_alloc	you can add aspell back in later, if you dont get a different spellchecker from the liberoffice install
2011-12-16T22:33:00.000Z	bad_alloc	pfifo	how can i get a look at what's inside the libreoffice package? and what happens to my dictionaries?
2011-12-16T22:33:00.000Z	pfifo	bad_alloc	dpkg -L <deb file>
2011-12-16T22:34:00.000Z	pfifo	bad_alloc	im not sure ive never tried it
