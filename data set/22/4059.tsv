2008-06-02T19:32:00.000Z	sriramoman	natasha	oh! sorry
2008-06-02T19:32:00.000Z	sriramoman	natasha	i dint call out ur name while telling ur problem.
2008-06-02T19:33:00.000Z	sriramoman	natasha	i had mentioned that ATI has a worse driver than nvidea, so u will face more problems than the other person

2008-06-02T19:36:00.000Z	natasha	sriramoman	So do you suggest I update?

2008-06-02T19:41:00.000Z	sriramoman	natasha	ok
2008-06-02T19:42:00.000Z	natasha	sriramoman	By the way, do you know why, although I installed network-manager-vpnc and pptp and openvpn and all the dependencies, why can't I see an option to create a vpn connection when I click on the network icon?
2008-06-02T19:42:00.000Z	natasha	sriramoman	I had it before I reinstalled my system
2008-06-02T19:42:00.000Z	sriramoman	natasha	i have *never* been able to run vpn successfully in my life
2008-06-02T19:43:00.000Z	natasha	sriramoman	it worked fine before!
2008-06-02T19:43:00.000Z	natasha	sriramoman	Even worked after I reinstalled my system, and then when all this mess happened this option also disappeared!
2008-06-02T19:43:00.000Z	sriramoman	natasha	pls, i dont know about vpn, as it has never ever wrkd in my sys.
2008-06-02T19:44:00.000Z	natasha	sriramoman	Ok.
