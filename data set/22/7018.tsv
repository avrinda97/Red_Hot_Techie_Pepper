2006-07-04T08:26:00.000Z	chespirito		or anything similar to adobe after effects,or combustion,actually,the softwares i used on winblows
2006-07-04T08:26:00.000Z	juztin	chespirito	i got cinelerra to run with ubuntu
2006-07-04T08:27:00.000Z	chespirito	juztin	how? :P
2006-07-04T08:28:00.000Z	juztin	chespirito	it was on another install that is now gone...but if i remember correctly, i downloaded it from the website and installed it :P
2006-07-04T08:28:00.000Z	juztin	chespirito	however, it ran a little slow due to my lack of necessary ram (i only have 256)
2006-07-04T08:29:00.000Z	chespirito	juztin	the problem is that i can't compile it
2006-07-04T08:29:00.000Z	juztin	chespirito	why not?
2006-07-04T08:30:00.000Z	juztin	chespirito	might wanna take that to the cinelerra forums...i bet they could help
2006-07-04T08:30:00.000Z	juztin	chespirito	it looks like a pretty decent video editor, except for the horrible icons they use for their effects :P
2006-07-04T08:31:00.000Z	juztin	chespirito	they look like they were drawn by a 12 year old with MS Paint
2006-07-04T08:31:00.000Z	chespirito	juztin	well,if i wanted nice icons,i'd be on winblows :P
2006-07-04T08:31:00.000Z	juztin	chespirito	lol, gotcha :D
2006-07-04T08:31:00.000Z	juztin	chespirito	that's how i did it, what whyami just said
