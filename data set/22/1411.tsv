I 'm in japan now.I wonder it linxu os could work around the eerom by virtually set regdomain to japan?

2010-05-22T19:25:00.000Z	thinkdpadT42		I wonder if there is wireless driver expert here ....they should  know the in-deep principle ...
2010-05-22T19:26:00.000Z	acicula	thinkdpadT42	what is it that you are trying to do exactly? im pretty sure the wireless card in a t42 will work?
2010-05-22T19:27:00.000Z	thinkdpadT42		regdomain code is different among all t42 made for  locales...
2010-05-22T19:27:00.000Z	thinkdpadT42		any expers here????????????//
2010-05-22T19:27:00.000Z	thinkdpadT42		al  are users?damn
2010-05-22T19:28:00.000Z	acicula	thinkdpadT42	your question is unclear, what do you mean by regdomain is diferent for location

2010-05-22T19:30:00.000Z	acicula	thinkdpadT42	so you want to change the firmware so it enables channel 14?
2010-05-22T19:31:00.000Z	thinkdpadT42		acicula,I  want to enable channel 13,now it only work with channel 1 to 11

2010-05-22T19:34:00.000Z	acicula	thinkdpadT42	what is your wireless driver, it appears it defaults to 1-11 but may take an option to use channel 1-13, or even channel 14(only valid for japan)
2010-05-22T19:34:00.000Z	thinkdpadT42		I wonder if the option only work in some specific situations....
2010-05-22T19:35:00.000Z	acicula	thinkdpadT42	the driver will have to support it yes, but i cant look at that if i dont know the driver you are using
