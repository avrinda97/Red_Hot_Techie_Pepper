2009-10-03T23:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	PCTeacher012	how you learned all the stuff you know about windos ? ... let me guess using it over the years ;)
2009-10-03T23:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	PCTeacher012	there are not magic web pages/books. only experience :)
2009-10-03T23:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	PCTeacher012	once installed it will do. at least it does here... the faxt that it opens them does not guarantee the pexe will work ok
