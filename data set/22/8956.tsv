2006-05-26T06:12:00.000Z	gordonjcp	joshua	because sometimes better things are harder to do
2006-05-26T06:12:00.000Z	gordonjcp	joshua	it's quite hard to drive a very high-performance car, but it's definitely better fun
2006-05-26T06:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	joshua	ok, how is it turning out to be a nightmare?
2006-05-26T06:14:00.000Z	gordonjcp	joshua	have you read the page in the wiki?
2006-05-26T06:14:00.000Z	gordonjcp	joshua	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion <- that one?
2006-05-26T06:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	joshua	I don't know what you are saying
2006-05-26T06:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	joshua	what won't let you do what?
2006-05-26T06:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	joshua	so what *exactly* are you getting stuck at?
2006-05-26T06:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	joshua	it should just download it onto your desktop
2006-05-26T06:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	joshua	you can probably find it with "cd ~/Desktop"
2006-05-26T06:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	joshua	have you opened a terminal window?
2006-05-26T06:20:00.000Z	gordonjcp	joshua	in the terminal window type "cd ~/Desktop"
2006-05-26T06:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	joshua	sorted?
