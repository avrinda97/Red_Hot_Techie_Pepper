2007-06-08T10:34:00.000Z	VeganChick		does anyone know how to force a laptop to boot off a dvd...other than pressing 'c' upon boot?
2007-06-08T10:34:00.000Z	LordLimecat	VeganChick	you would change the boot order in the bios
2007-06-08T10:35:00.000Z	LordLimecat	VeganChick	youd probably want floppy-->cd-->harddrive
2007-06-08T10:35:00.000Z	VeganChick	LordLimecat	floppy? who uses that anymore?! haha...
2007-06-08T10:36:00.000Z	VeganChick	LordLimecat	what do i do to change the boot order in the bios?
2007-06-08T10:36:00.000Z	LordLimecat	VeganChick	TBH, i hate floppy drives, the power connector sucks and has shorted at LEAST one of my powersupplies
2007-06-08T10:36:00.000Z	LordLimecat	VeganChick	you press some F key @ boot up
2007-06-08T10:37:00.000Z	VeganChick	LordLimecat	so i just try one of those 3 and see what works?
2007-06-08T10:37:00.000Z	VeganChick	LordLimecat	ok
2007-06-08T10:38:00.000Z	VeganChick	LordLimecat	ok, restarting now w/ tab
2007-06-08T10:38:00.000Z	VeganChick	LordLimecat	eh...forgot to mention i'm on a G3 iBook
2007-06-08T10:47:00.000Z	VeganChick	LordLimecat	Stormx2: i don't get any response for 'tab', 'del', 'F2', 'F8', or 'F10'...and 'F12' is also 'eject', so it just spits my dvd out...anything else to try?
2007-06-08T10:49:00.000Z	LordLimecat	VeganChick	its not ubuntu, its macs using some crazy newfangled key to get into the bios
2007-06-08T10:51:00.000Z	LordLimecat	VeganChick	is trying to start up the live cd without having to hit that key
2007-06-08T10:52:00.000Z	VeganChick	LordLimecat	will do
2007-06-08T10:53:00.000Z	VeganChick	LordLimecat	not it
2007-06-08T10:53:00.000Z	LordLimecat	VeganChick	that thread may make more sense to you than me :)
2007-06-08T10:54:00.000Z	VeganChick	LordLimecat	rotfl...i've pretty much only ever used macs. used them my whole life.
2007-06-08T10:56:00.000Z	VeganChick	LordLimecat	i'm not dualbooting. forgot to mention that. the laptop has solely ubuntu on it...which was probably a mistake
2007-06-08T10:56:00.000Z	LordLimecat	VeganChick	i have no idea, but heres one more possible help:
2007-06-08T10:59:00.000Z	VeganChick	LordLimecat	i tried 'alt' and that got to the manual loader screen...but all that shows up is the linux hd...
2007-06-08T10:59:00.000Z	LordLimecat	VeganChick	:( i dont know
