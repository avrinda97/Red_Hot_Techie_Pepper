2007-01-13T12:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	Cygwin might have it
2007-01-15T16:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	lets put it this way, it is easier to do something wrong and screw up linux, it's also easy to do everything right and still screw up windows :)
2007-01-31T14:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	And on the PPC side nvidia is actually worse believe it or not :)
2007-03-27T14:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	Forgot a second "sudo"
2007-03-27T14:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	Never mind :)
2007-05-31T08:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	Shouldn't he just be able to remove both then re-install xorg?
2007-05-31T08:18:00.000Z	mneptok	Jordan_U	he doesn't remember what packages
2007-05-31T08:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	If he just removed packages ( like he says ) then he can chroot in and install ubuntu-minimal+desktop
2007-05-31T08:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	This is just temporary to do a one time chroot
2007-06-07T08:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	I need to go but it seems you know how to help jack|ass , remember to tell him to edit the automagic kernel section so the changes persist
2007-06-13T07:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	totem-gstreamer does not support DVD menus
2009-07-13T11:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	No it's not
2009-07-13T11:58:00.000Z	mneptok	Jordan_U	the upgrade will cause issues, as ubottu says
2009-07-13T11:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	I think update-manager re-installs it before upgrades automatically
2009-10-21T23:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	Not the hardware warentee
2009-10-21T23:32:00.000Z	mneptok	Jordan_U	yes, the hardware warrantee, in many cases.
2009-10-21T23:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	Support is not the same as replacing the hardware under warentee
2009-10-21T23:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	I've only encountered one person who claimed that using Linux voided my hardware warranty and that was an Apple store employee who was told by his manager that he was wrong
2010-02-10T11:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mneptok	Source on the xfs problems? Do they effect grub2?
2010-02-10T11:45:00.000Z	mneptok	Jordan_U	GRUB2 advertises better XFS support, but i still wouldn't trust /boot to XFS. just as i would not trust /boot to any encrypted filesystem.
2011-02-17T05:03:00.000Z	mneptok	Jordan_U	freebse is giving help, not asking for it
2012-03-13T03:02:00.000Z	mneptok	Jordan_U	correct, the grub-install is what's missing
