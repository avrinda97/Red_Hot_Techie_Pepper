2005-03-25T17:22:00.000Z	LordGrunt		how about my ./configure issue? ...?
2005-03-25T17:22:00.000Z	LordGrunt		checking build system type... configure: error: cannot guess build type; you must specify one
2005-03-25T17:22:00.000Z	LordGrunt		why is that happening?
2005-03-25T17:23:00.000Z	LordGrunt		or other case, how to install xorg?
2005-03-25T06:29:00.000Z	LordGrunt		hi
2005-03-25T06:30:00.000Z	LordGrunt		why there is so much of python all around in this distro? can i safely remove it?
2005-03-25T06:30:00.000Z	LordGrunt		yo, apo ;)
2005-03-25T06:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	LordGrunt	python is a favourite with the developers - I suspect things will break if you remove it
2005-03-25T07:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	LordGrunt	kdm
2005-03-25T07:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	LordGrunt	I suppose - haven't tried it. It would need to be made default I guess
2005-03-25T07:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	LordGrunt	why aren't you just using kubuntu?
2005-03-25T07:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	LordGrunt	that would be a reason... *grin*
2005-03-25T08:20:00.000Z	LordGrunt	thoreauputic	he have no ubuntu installed
2005-03-25T08:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	LordGrunt	yes he does - i spent about an hour in pm with him trying to get ppp working
2005-03-25T08:22:00.000Z	LordGrunt	thoreauputic	and works now? the system i mean? i thought he stopped install after net errors
2005-03-25T08:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	LordGrunt	he's trying to get isdn working ( fade3)
2005-03-25T14:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	LordGrunt	NEVER run X apps as root , unless specified for config etc
2005-03-25T14:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	LordGrunt	of course you did
2005-03-25T14:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	LordGrunt	read our lips: root is for administration
2005-03-25T14:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	LordGrunt	it *is* helping you to warn you not to run stuff as root
2005-03-25T14:09:00.000Z	LordGrunt	thoreauputic	save your time, what was working, needs to work still. that's all i asked
2005-03-25T14:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	LordGrunt	 google "mit-magic-cookie"
