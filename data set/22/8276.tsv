2007-08-10T06:38:00.000Z	CzarAlex		My system time is off by about 15 minutes. using CLI, how can I change/update this? Is there some command to sync with a server?
2007-08-10T06:38:00.000Z	sipior	CzarAlex	ntpdate
2007-08-10T06:39:00.000Z	CzarAlex	sipior	Lemme try that.
2007-08-10T06:39:00.000Z	CzarAlex	sipior	10 Aug 08:52:00 ntpdate[27858] : no servers can be used, exiting
2007-08-10T06:39:00.000Z	sipior	CzarAlex	you'll need to tell it which server to use, of course
2007-08-10T06:39:00.000Z	CzarAlex	sipior	I see :) where can I find a list?
2007-08-10T06:40:00.000Z	sipior	CzarAlex	i believe ntp.ubuntu.com works
2007-08-10T06:40:00.000Z	CzarAlex	sipior	Thanky.
2007-08-10T06:41:00.000Z	sipior	CzarAlex	there are also regional timeservers, possibly closer to where you are, network-wise
2007-08-10T06:41:00.000Z	CzarAlex	sipior	Understood. And everything seems to be fine now. Thanks!
2007-08-10T06:42:00.000Z	sipior	CzarAlex	glad to help
2007-08-10T07:09:00.000Z	sipior	CzarAlex	"unalias ls", then try gain
2007-08-10T07:09:00.000Z	CzarAlex	sipior	bash: unalias: ls: not found
2007-08-10T07:09:00.000Z	sipior	CzarAlex	odd. how did you change the default listing then?
2007-08-10T07:09:00.000Z	CzarAlex	sipior	I was trying to backup an mysql database but forgot to specifty a file to dump it to, so the text was all up on the screen. To abort, I did Ctrl+C and now the ls is borked.
2007-08-10T07:09:00.000Z	sipior	CzarAlex	try "stty sane" and then ls
2007-08-10T07:09:00.000Z	CzarAlex	sipior	no change.
2007-08-10T07:10:00.000Z	sipior	CzarAlex	but if you open another terminal, it displays fine, right?
2007-08-10T07:10:00.000Z	CzarAlex	sipior	Yes. another terminal window is fine.
2007-08-10T07:11:00.000Z	CzarAlex	sipior	i. uh.. closed off the ssh program, restarted it, and now it works fine?
2007-08-10T07:11:00.000Z	sipior	CzarAlex	well, terminals get b0rked sometimes :) probably just easiest to start fresh in another.
2007-08-10T07:11:00.000Z	CzarAlex	sipior	haha Thanks! *facepalms*
