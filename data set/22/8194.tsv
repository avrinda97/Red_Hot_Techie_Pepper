2005-10-08T09:23:00.000Z	Answer		Question: How do I get the last command issued from the history, from a shell script, without using UP Arrow or .bash_history?
2005-10-08T09:23:00.000Z	ccooke	Answer	what is the problem you're trying to solve?
2005-10-08T09:24:00.000Z	ccooke	Answer	you can get the last thing *typed* - history | tail -1
2005-10-08T09:24:00.000Z	Answer	ccooke	 When users issue certain commands I want to capture them instead of executing, with something like an alias that runs a script
2005-10-08T09:24:00.000Z	ccooke	Answer	... capture them?
2005-10-08T09:25:00.000Z	ccooke	Answer	you want to make certain commands do something else, basically?
2005-10-08T09:25:00.000Z	Answer	ccooke	Yes, to intercept potentially harmful commands like rm *
2005-10-08T09:25:00.000Z	ccooke	Answer	what would you want to do with them, afterwards?
2005-10-08T09:26:00.000Z	Answer	ccooke	No, email it to an administrator with whoami and date
2005-10-08T09:26:00.000Z	Answer	ccooke	and pwd also
2005-10-08T09:26:00.000Z	ccooke	Answer	okay. The simplest answer is "you can't"
2005-10-08T09:26:00.000Z	Answer	ccooke	 It is easy to alias rm to run a script that executes various commands, I just want to capture the command the user entered in that script.
2005-10-08T09:28:00.000Z	ccooke	Answer	okay. you can get the parameters of a script with "${@}" inside it.
2005-10-08T09:29:00.000Z	ccooke	Answer	but I think you should probably look at a restricted shell.
2005-10-08T09:29:00.000Z	Answer	ccooke	Yes I can get the script arguments, but the alias script wasn't getting the original command as an argument, so I wanted it from history.  I think renaming the rm binary will work
2005-10-08T09:30:00.000Z	ccooke	Answer	it will, as long as nobody finds out what rm has been renamed to :-)
2006-06-30T06:27:00.000Z	ccooke	Answer	1) Please don't repeat a question
2006-06-30T06:28:00.000Z	Answer	ccooke	answer the first time then. don't be a jerk
2006-06-30T06:29:00.000Z	ccooke	Answer	2) If they don't appear automatically, you can use 'killall gnome-panel' to force it to reload. If it doesn't appear then, the application you installed doesn't add a menu item. Add one yourself with Applications -> Accessories -> Alacarte menu editor
2006-06-30T06:29:00.000Z	ccooke	Answer	3) Being rude will not get you *any* answers. Calling people a jerk is being rude, as is repeating your question. This is a busy channel, please do not add even more noise to it.
