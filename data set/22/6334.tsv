2006-11-09T17:38:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	doubt it...what do you need
2006-11-09T17:39:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	can you be more specific?
2006-11-09T17:40:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	ok...what is no-ip...is it a .deb package or a binary? Where are you trying to put it?
2006-11-09T17:42:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	sounds like you are trying to compile a src file....rather a complicated task for a newbie. When you extracted it, it should have created a folder on the desktop, if you look in that folder, to you see something called Makefile, and something called configure?
2006-11-09T17:43:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	OK...we will give this a try, but it will probably not work and debugging it is not something we can do over IRC...but let's give this a go....
2006-11-09T17:43:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	open a terminal and type 'cd ~/Desktop'
2006-11-09T17:46:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	did you type the command I gave you?
2006-11-09T17:49:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	you downloaded the file to your desktop, right? Are you logged in as 'server'?
2006-11-09T17:50:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	ok...at the prompt type 'cd ~'
2006-11-09T17:50:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	now type 'ls' and see if there is a 'Desktop'
2006-11-09T17:51:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	OK...type 'cd Desktop'
2006-11-09T17:53:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	ok....now type 'configure' and see if it runs. If so, let it finish and let me know when
2006-11-09T17:53:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	oops....type './configure'....sorry
2006-11-09T17:54:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	type 'pwd' and let me know what it says
2006-11-09T17:56:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	is the 'd' in desktop upper or lower case?
2006-11-09T17:56:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	right...case is important....type 'ls' and see if you can spot the folder that was created on yoru desktop
2006-11-09T17:57:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	ok....type 'cd foldername' (you never told me what it is <smile>)
2006-11-09T17:59:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	now try './configure'
2006-11-09T06:00:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	if you type 'ls' do you see the files you saw earlier....Makefile and configure?
2006-11-09T06:01:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	then let's try this....type 'make' and see if that runs
2006-11-09T06:02:00.000Z	thor	SHR3K	then you don't have the compiler (gcc) or a bunch of other stuff installed. Like I said...really too complex for IRC
