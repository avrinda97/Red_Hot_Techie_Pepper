2007-03-27T13:43:00.000Z	shirish		Anybody knows how I can download a specific .deb through the universe repository through windows/firefox . I 'm not able to use apt-get or aptitude under ubuntu, something in my networking is broken.
2007-03-27T13:44:00.000Z	Flannel	shirish	packages.ubuntu.com, then once you find the packages, down near the bottom theres a table with the different arches, click the arch, and select a mirror
2007-10-30T08:11:00.000Z	Flannel	shirish	that's expected.  Ubuntu uses the debian apache config structure
2007-10-30T08:12:00.000Z	shirish	Flannel	can you help me , I'm trying to set http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/CouldNotDetermineServerName right, so I can restart & stop apache without issues
2007-10-30T08:12:00.000Z	shirish	Flannel	its going to be a local thing, just to see some stuff.
2007-10-30T08:13:00.000Z	Flannel	shirish	Add it to apache2.conf
2007-10-30T08:13:00.000Z	Flannel	shirish	apache2.conf is where serverwide configs go, then module configs go in their respective .conf files in mods-available, and virtualhost specific things go in their repsective VH files in sites-available
2007-10-30T08:13:00.000Z	shirish	Flannel	can I do something like ServerName shirish.example.com (it just needs any damn name or something in particular) ?
2007-10-30T08:14:00.000Z	Flannel	shirish	yeah, it should be somewhere that you can be found, whether thats a local thing (subnet IP) or a dyndns address, or whatnot
2007-10-30T08:14:00.000Z	shirish	Flannel	is it ok to talk in private? That way I can know what to do , I just want to play around with stuff, nothing big
2007-10-30T08:15:00.000Z	Flannel	shirish	Is this on a separate computer you've got on your LAN? (your private server) or is it your desktop that you're running apache on and'll be accessing it from that computer only?
2007-10-30T08:16:00.000Z	shirish	Flannel	the second one, a single desktop I'm running apache on & I'll be accessing from this computer only.
2007-10-30T08:16:00.000Z	Flannel	shirish	Alright, then go ahead and use 127.0.0.1 for your IP
2007-10-30T08:22:00.000Z	shirish	Flannel	Flynsarmy: guys this is what I've done at http://pastebin.ca/754669 is that good enough?
2008-05-09T07:01:00.000Z	shirish	Flannel	/etc/hostname has the name Mugglewille
2008-05-09T07:02:00.000Z	Flannel	shirish	but /etc/hosts doesn't I imagine
2008-05-09T07:02:00.000Z	Flannel	shirish	with the d?
2008-05-09T07:03:00.000Z	Flannel	shirish	also, 127.0.0.1 not 127.0.1.1
2008-05-09T07:04:00.000Z	shirish	Flannel	are u saying I should remove the d?
2008-05-09T07:04:00.000Z	Flannel	shirish	That second line should read: 127.0.0.1 M...whatever
2008-05-09T07:04:00.000Z	shirish	Flannel	Ok will do the changes.
2008-05-09T07:07:00.000Z	shirish	Flannel	corrected, thanx
