2011-06-11T22:05:00.000Z	touchpadlock		anyone know how to lock the touchpad during typing in ubuntu 11.04?
2011-06-11T22:05:00.000Z	escott	touchpadlock	see if there is a preference in the mouse settings
2011-06-11T22:05:00.000Z	touchpadlock	escott	its not
2011-06-11T22:33:00.000Z	escott	touchpadlock	it would be synaptics something
2011-06-11T22:34:00.000Z	touchpadlock	escott	i'll search for a synaptics package to install (i believe synaptic is also the package manager name)
2011-06-11T22:34:00.000Z	touchpadlock	escott	no, no software found in the software manager
2011-06-11T22:34:00.000Z	escott	touchpadlock	there are two things called synaptic one is the package manager the other is the touchpad driver
2011-06-11T22:34:00.000Z	touchpadlock	escott	okay, it is synaptiks
2011-06-11T22:36:00.000Z	escott	touchpadlock	assuming you are using xorg-input-synaptics driver for the touchpad the gnome mouse settings should show you a touchpad tab
2011-06-11T22:37:00.000Z	touchpadlock	escott	the computer came with ubuntu 11.04 already install, don't know, i could check apt-get to see if its installed
2011-06-11T22:38:00.000Z	escott	touchpadlock	grep -i synaptic /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2011-06-11T22:38:00.000Z	touchpadlock	escott	i checked for that synaptics-input-xorg program but there is a bug in apt-get where it will not check if you have the program installed first before telling you another program is locking dpkg
2011-06-11T22:39:00.000Z	touchpadlock	escott	with the grep nothing comes up; nano pulls it up and no findings of "synaptic" or "touchpad" in the log
2011-06-11T22:40:00.000Z	escott	touchpadlock	what kind of touchpad is this? what kind of laptop? what does xinput --list say about it
2011-06-11T22:40:00.000Z	touchpadlock	escott	i'll dump online the log, can you url me?
2011-06-11T22:42:00.000Z	touchpadlock	escott	http://paste.ubuntu.com/624495/
2011-06-11T22:44:00.000Z	escott	touchpadlock	seems that it doesn't recognize this touchpad and just assumes its a mouse
2011-06-11T22:44:00.000Z	escott	touchpadlock	probably the thing to do is force synaptics to control it
2011-06-11T22:44:00.000Z	touchpadlock	escott	its definately a touchpad, i am installing synaptiks (with a k) now, its 80 mb donwload
2011-06-11T22:45:00.000Z	escott	touchpadlock	see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1502560
2011-06-11T22:45:00.000Z	touchpadlock	escott	thanks, i'll use that when it installed, thanks again for your help and patience
