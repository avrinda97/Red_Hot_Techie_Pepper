2007-08-07T14:59:00.000Z	desertc__		<danv12>: you might have to do some reseach beyond this channel

2007-08-07T15:02:00.000Z	rdygo	desertc__	i tried :)
2007-08-07T15:03:00.000Z	rdygo	desertc__	this article doesn't work for me.
2007-08-07T15:03:00.000Z	desertc__	rdygo	this is problematic
2007-08-07T15:03:00.000Z	rdygo	desertc__	It installed well, but still gives "Error 15: File not found."
2007-08-07T15:03:00.000Z	desertc__	rdygo	... did you reseach by searching on the 'Net ?
2007-08-07T15:04:00.000Z	rdygo	desertc__	yes, i tried many tricks, but this problem still continues.
2007-08-07T15:04:00.000Z	desertc__	rdygo	I can't tell you the answer - I am no GRUB expert
2007-08-07T15:05:00.000Z	rdygo	desertc__	ok :(
2007-08-07T15:05:00.000Z	desertc__	rdygo	Quite frankly, I just shoot people in the right direction
2007-08-07T15:05:00.000Z	desertc__	rdygo	You know what the problem is - you just need a fix
2007-08-07T15:06:00.000Z	rdygo	desertc__	but i (and all of ubuntu and kubuntu channels) can't fix it, this is the problem :)
2007-08-07T15:06:00.000Z	rdygo	desertc__	safe mode fails.
