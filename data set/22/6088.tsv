2007-05-15T09:33:00.000Z	judah		can someone please tell me how to execute a sudo command in GNOME in the gui on fiesty?
2007-05-15T09:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	judah	what sudo command do you need?
2007-05-15T09:34:00.000Z	judah	IndyGunFreak	I need to copy a file from my home directory to the usr/share/ directory.  I was trying to use to open file browsers to drag and drop, but it says I don't have access to the directory. Even though I'm using the sudo account..
2007-05-15T09:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	judah	if you're using gnome.. open a terminal, and type gksudo nautilus
2007-05-15T09:41:00.000Z	judah	IndyGunFreak	thanks that worked.  But it was very slow. It looked liked in the terminal it was trying to make a "secure" connection?  is that right?
2007-05-15T09:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	judah	yeah, but it shoudln't have been slow.
2007-05-15T09:42:00.000Z	judah	IndyGunFreak	it is an older computer amdk400 or 450 with 300 megs of ram, would that make a difference?
2007-05-15T09:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	judah	probably.., are you running gnome?
2007-05-15T09:43:00.000Z	judah	IndyGunFreak	yeah.. day to day stuff in the gui isn't really that slow though, just when I tried to sudo nautilus thing..
2007-05-15T09:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	judah	ok.. just remember though, sudo orks, but when you run nautilus like that, you want to gksudo, not sudo.
2007-05-15T09:44:00.000Z	judah	IndyGunFreak	ok, thanks alot of the help. what does the "gk" signify?
2007-05-15T09:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	judah	its just a security issue of using sudo, instead of gksudo, with graphical programs... like nautilus
2007-05-15T09:45:00.000Z	judah	IndyGunFreak	ok.. thanks again man..
2007-05-15T09:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	judah	if you're staying in CLI, sudo is fine, but if the command is going to open a graphical program and give you root access, use gksudo.
2007-05-15T09:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		no problem
2007-05-15T09:47:00.000Z	judah	IndyGunFreak	ok, sometimes I just use the gui cause it's easier, other times I use the cli and knew how to use sudo in that enviroment, I just couldn't figure out the Graphical "sudo" thing..
2007-05-15T09:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	judah	yeah, once you get the hang of it, its easy.. but that PC, if you start to notice serious speed problems, etc, might be a little better suited to Xubuntu..
2007-05-15T09:49:00.000Z	judah	IndyGunFreak	yeah, this is just kinda of a testbed computer to check out fiesty.  I've used suse for years, so ubuntu does some things differently that is throwing me off a little..
2007-05-15T09:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	judah	oh i see, so you're not a complete newbie, just new to ubuntu
2007-05-15T09:50:00.000Z	judah	IndyGunFreak	yeah.. ;)
2007-05-15T09:51:00.000Z	judah	IndyGunFreak	gotta run, but thanks again mate!
2007-05-15T09:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	judah	np, take care
