2009-04-27T21:34:00.000Z	kryptik		I'm having trouble configuring my audio card. Could anyone point me in a direction to make the correct choices?
2009-04-27T21:36:00.000Z	kryptik		Is there an auto-config wizard for audio devices or something?
2009-04-27T21:37:00.000Z	kryptik		My audio card has worked before, but it is not working now.
2009-04-27T21:37:00.000Z	kryptik		When I go to preferences -> Sound and try different configurations the sound tests "work"
2009-04-27T21:38:00.000Z	kryptik		Audigy 2 ZS
2009-04-27T21:38:00.000Z	kryptik		Creative.
2009-04-27T21:39:00.000Z	kryptik		When I run test on the different options in Sound Preferences I hear a long beep on some, nothing on others and some won't configure at all to test.
2009-04-27T21:40:00.000Z	kryptik		okay
2009-04-27T21:42:00.000Z	C_Kode	kryptik	Do you see "Audigy A"?

2009-04-27T21:42:00.000Z	C_Kode	kryptik	How many channels do you see?
2009-04-27T21:43:00.000Z	kryptik	C_Kode	Card: PulseAudio    Chip: PulseAudio   View: [Playback] Capture  All     Item: Master

2009-04-27T21:44:00.000Z	kryptik	C_Kode	What do you mean? I opened a terminal and typed alsamixer.
2009-04-27T21:44:00.000Z	C_Kode		ok, press sideways, I think you're not seeing them all
2009-04-27T21:44:00.000Z	kryptik		K_Code: No I already tried that :(
2009-04-27T21:46:00.000Z	kryptik		K_Code: okay I pressed f5 and got it to show all, but I only see master and captur
2009-04-27T21:48:00.000Z	kryptik		Can anyone help me with my Audio card? I'm in the alsamixer and I've tried using the sound preferences but I can't seem to get anything to come out :/
2009-04-27T21:50:00.000Z	C_Kode	kryptik	Have you tried "alsa force-reload"
2009-04-27T21:50:00.000Z	kryptik	C_Kode	No, one moment.
