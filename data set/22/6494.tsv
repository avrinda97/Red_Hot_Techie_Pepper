2006-12-01T16:32:00.000Z	YoG		hi, can someone help me? when i start gnome and the network is on the panels crash... when i start with the network off (ifdown ra0) it loads ok
2006-12-01T16:33:00.000Z	mnepton	YoG	check the panel applets. one may rely on net connectivity (e.g. weather)
2006-12-01T16:34:00.000Z	YoG	mnepton	i tried removing all the applets - can there be "invisible" applets?
2006-12-01T16:34:00.000Z	mnepton	YoG	try moving .gconf aside and see wha'ppens.
2006-12-01T16:36:00.000Z	YoG	mnepton	is .gconf - what holds all the definitions for the panels?
2006-12-01T16:36:00.000Z	mnepton	YoG	.gconf = GNOME configuration settings.
2006-12-01T16:36:00.000Z	mnepton	YoG	lots of stuff in there, not just apnel applets. but if by moving it aside the problem disappears, you have a better idea of the culprit.
2006-12-01T16:39:00.000Z	YoG	mnepton	- just got an error window from gnome: "there was an error starting the GNOME setting deamon"... is it giving us any clues?
2006-12-01T16:39:00.000Z	mnepton	YoG	nope, that's expected. .gconf has gone "missing" but GNOME *should* load anyway.
2006-12-01T16:39:00.000Z	mnepton	YoG	it will complain, but still start. or should.
2006-12-01T16:39:00.000Z	YoG	mnepton	system exception: IDL:Bonobo/
2006-12-01T16:39:00.000Z	YoG	mnepton	I didn't remove .gconf yet
2006-12-01T16:40:00.000Z	YoG	mnepton	ok, will do.
2006-12-01T16:40:00.000Z	YoG	mnepton	what about .gconfd?
2006-12-01T16:41:00.000Z	mnepton	YoG	try with that in place, and if it fails, set that aside, too.
2006-12-01T17:21:00.000Z	YoG	mnepton	are you still here?
2006-12-01T17:22:00.000Z	mnepton	YoG	eye yam
2006-12-01T17:24:00.000Z	YoG	mnepton	- brb...
2006-12-01T17:26:00.000Z	YoG	mnepton	(sorry for the delay) i removed .gconf and .gconfd
2006-12-01T17:27:00.000Z	YoG	mnepton	the situation no is as follows: if i login gnome with networking it takes about ~3-5 minutes to login (from the greeter to the desktop) most of the time i see the brown screen. after which gnome starts ok (so it seems)
2006-12-01T17:28:00.000Z	YoG	mnepton	if i start gnome without networking it starts just fine
2006-12-01T17:28:00.000Z	YoG	mnepton	(no more than 20 secs.)
