2008-08-21T04:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	seekingtruth	avoid wubi
2008-08-21T04:59:00.000Z	seekingtruth	Jack_Sparrow	why avoid wubi?
2008-08-21T05:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	seekingtruth	read the faq on wubi.. I wont use, recommend nor support it
2008-08-21T05:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	seekingtruth	no
2008-08-21T05:00:00.000Z	seekingtruth	Jack_Sparrow	where is he faq that warns against using wubi?
2008-08-21T05:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	seekingtruth	Just read the wubi faq.. those are scary enough, although they are not intending to warn you about using it
2008-08-21T05:01:00.000Z	seekingtruth	Jack_Sparrow	where is the wubi faq?
2008-08-21T05:02:00.000Z	seekingtruth	Jack_Sparrow	do you mean http://launchpad.net/wubi/+filebug ?
2008-08-21T05:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	seekingtruth	I am saying wubi screwed up my entire ntfs drive and my windows install
2008-08-21T05:03:00.000Z	seekingtruth	Jack_Sparrow	ouch!  but I thought wubi didnt mess with that?
2008-08-21T05:03:00.000Z	seekingtruth	Jack_Sparrow	so wubi messed with your windows partition. MBR etc?
2008-08-21T05:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	seekingtruth	Wubi is entirely on your ntfs drive.. you are asking for problems
2008-08-21T05:04:00.000Z	seekingtruth	Jack_Sparrow	ok ill stick with using virtualbox then :P
2008-08-21T05:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	seekingtruth	at best.. it is for a windows user to try it out.  Never for long term use
2008-08-21T05:05:00.000Z	seekingtruth	Jack_Sparrow	if my windows is clean of any keyloggers, is it safe and secure to use Ubuntu via virtualbox as my netbanking browser?  safer than windows, right?
2008-08-21T05:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	seekingtruth	I would not do it..
2008-08-21T05:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	seekingtruth	Just poing out there are some not nice things that can happen
2008-08-21T05:08:00.000Z	seekingtruth	Jack_Sparrow	yeah, valid reasons to avoid it.  I will keep using Virtualbox to run ubuntu.  In vbox ubuntu also is encrypted, so thats good
