2011-06-19T05:40:00.000Z	moonchild		hey guys
2011-06-19T05:40:00.000Z	moonchild		I'm wondering if anyone here has any knowledge of the ath5k driver
2011-06-19T05:41:00.000Z	moonchild		I'm running into some networking issues, and I'm trying to weed out variables from a complex
2011-06-19T05:41:00.000Z	moonchild		setup
2011-06-19T05:42:00.000Z	seidos	moonchild	what about the driver?  like source code?
2011-06-19T05:42:00.000Z	moonchild		I'm not looking for source-level knowledge
2011-06-19T05:42:00.000Z	seidos		i haven't had any problem with ath5k, in 3 different distros now
2011-06-19T05:42:00.000Z	moonchild		just brain-dumps of what people know
2011-06-19T05:43:00.000Z	moonchild	seidos	would you mind a PM, if you've used ath5k cards a bit?
2011-06-19T05:43:00.000Z	seidos	moonchild	go for it
2011-06-19T05:44:00.000Z	moonchild		well, this question is about using the ath5k card in a firewall, and there are a lot of variables
2011-06-19T05:44:00.000Z	seidos	moonchild	oh yeah, i think policy is they prefer that it be logged
2011-06-19T05:45:00.000Z	seidos	moonchild	sounds like your question is with iptables or ufw then
2011-06-19T05:45:00.000Z	moonchild		alright I'll explain the problem in public
2011-06-19T05:45:00.000Z	moonchild		it may lie with iptables
2011-06-19T05:46:00.000Z	moonchild		ok, let me first describe the network topology
2011-06-19T05:46:00.000Z	moonchild		I've got a comcast cable box, connected to a 1st gen apple airport, connected via cable to a netgear b/g router
2011-06-19T05:47:00.000Z	moonchild		in my bedroom, I have a box that has a ath5k card that is acting as a firewall & router for my own stuff
2011-06-19T05:48:00.000Z	moonchild		I recently built a new machine and installed win7 on it
2011-06-19T05:49:00.000Z	moonchild		it seems every time the win7 box tries to do ipv6 update stuff, the wireless card in my firewall disassociates from the access point
2011-06-19T05:50:00.000Z	moonchild	seidos	did you absorb all of that amongst the other traffic?
2011-06-19T05:53:00.000Z	seidos	moonchild	nope.  once you said firewall it didn't seem like an ath5k issue to me
