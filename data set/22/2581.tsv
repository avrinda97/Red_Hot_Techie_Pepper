2010-05-02T18:10:00.000Z	Jenk		how do i get a list of the programs i've installed ?
2010-05-02T18:11:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Jenk	dpkg -l
2010-05-02T18:14:00.000Z	Jenk	bilalakhtar	umm, not libs and all... only the apps, say like codecs or some utility like GParted... how do I get a list of that ?
2010-05-02T18:14:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Jenk	use software center, since there is no other way to see the apps installed
2010-05-02T18:15:00.000Z	Jenk	bilalakhtar	am using 9.04... no Software Center... anyway to get a list ?
2010-05-02T18:16:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Jenk	I am afraid not.
2010-05-02T18:16:00.000Z	Jenk	bilalakhtar	thanx anyway...
2010-05-02T18:16:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Jenk	Well, one thing you should know, is that one application may consist of more than one package.
2010-05-02T18:17:00.000Z	Jenk	bilalakhtar	okay... but if i have the name of that app, the dependencies will be automatically installed , right ?
2010-05-02T18:17:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Jenk	Of course
2010-05-02T18:18:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Jenk	That's the main reason why apt was invented
2010-05-02T18:18:00.000Z	Jenk	bilalakhtar	yup, and anyway that apt keeps a file os programs currently installed by the user ?
2010-05-02T18:20:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Jenk	For that open up Synaptic and then see the history
2010-05-02T18:21:00.000Z	Jenk	bilalakhtar	thanx, but please, could you give some more details ?
2010-05-02T18:22:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Jenk	Open up the Synaptic package manager and select the History option from the first meny
2010-05-02T18:24:00.000Z	Jenk	bilalakhtar	that helps, but is there some way that i can get that list without it organised under dates and all ?
2010-05-02T18:25:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Jenk	What do you want to do ? You want to move to a new version of Ubuntu?
2010-05-02T18:25:00.000Z	Jenk	bilalakhtar	Yes... but I want to have my old apps as well... a list of them, that I can install on the new one...
2010-05-02T18:26:00.000Z	Jenk	bilalakhtar	than you, i've used that before but i'm moving to another version of ubuntu and doing a fresh install and then install all the apps that i had on my old system.
2010-05-02T18:30:00.000Z	Jenk	bilalakhtar	that command gives a list of everything that is installed in ubuntu after a fresh install + everything else after that. Is there anyway that i can get a list of all the apps installed after my install ?
2010-05-02T18:31:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Jenk	Sorry | can't do |ha|
2010-05-02T18:31:00.000Z	Jenk	bilalakhtar	thanx though, it helped... :)
