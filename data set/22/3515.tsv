2008-08-17T01:53:00.000Z	Agent_bob		ean you speak geek ?    what are you trying to do, cause i don't understand that.
2008-08-17T01:54:00.000Z	Ean	Agent_bob	Geek? I want to have my HDD as a folder under my home folder /home/user.
2008-08-17T01:55:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Ean	ok  set up /etc/fstab to mount it there
2008-08-17T01:56:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Ean	i don't know what fs you are talking about.  but if some M$ fs then you will need to specify uid/gid/?mask  or it won't be accessable to the yesr in question.   if a linux fs then just own it once mounted.
2008-08-17T01:57:00.000Z	Agent_bob		s/yesr/user
2008-08-17T01:57:00.000Z	Ean	Agent_bob	Ok, when I have edited my fstab file, can I reload it without restatign my system? :/
2008-08-17T01:58:00.000Z	Ean	Agent_bob	Just that when I installed Ubuntu I mounted the disk as /hallonsaft, but I didn't get any privilegies... ...
2008-08-17T01:58:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Ean	you don't "load" it per'se  mount just reads from it.    sudo mount -a   will mount what ever is in there with an auto mount setting
2008-08-17T01:59:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Ean	sounds like an M$ file system   ?
2008-08-17T01:59:00.000Z	Ean	Agent_bob	I meant more like reload the fstab so it used the new settigns... :P
2008-08-17T01:59:00.000Z	Agent_bob		again you don't load the fstab file at any time.
2008-08-17T02:00:00.000Z	Ean	Agent_bob	No, its just a simple ext3 system...
2008-08-17T02:00:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Ean	ok then fstab has nothing to do with permissions on it.    you will have to won or mod the fs root
2008-08-17T02:01:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Ean	example;   sudo chown ean /mountpoint/blah/
2008-08-17T02:01:00.000Z	Ean	Agent_bob	Ok
2008-08-17T02:02:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Ean	the root of the fs is the same as any folder or file in it.   it has permissions and ownership too
2008-08-17T02:02:00.000Z	Ean	Agent_bob	ok
2008-08-17T02:02:00.000Z	Ean	Agent_bob	but I got a NTFS, M$ in a folder under /home. That partition isn't listed under fstab, how can I change it to /home/user? :P
2008-08-17T02:03:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Ean	that partition also has no ownership/permissions bits.   so it's a mount option that sets those things.   sudo mount -o remount,umask=000 /mount/point/
2008-08-17T02:04:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Ean	you would probably be well advised to either enroll in linux file systems 101   or visit the infonode !ntfs
2008-08-17T02:04:00.000Z	Agent_bob		!ntfs > Ean
2008-08-17T02:05:00.000Z	Ean	Agent_bob	Ok, thanks for the help. I will try to read that ^^
