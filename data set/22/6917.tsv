2008-06-04T04:55:00.000Z	soundray	pain	you need to say what the problem is
2008-06-04T04:55:00.000Z	pain		Oh
2008-06-04T04:55:00.000Z	pain		I get to the boot menu, for Ubuntu or Xp and I choose Ubuntu and it takes me to the shell menu.
2008-06-04T04:56:00.000Z	soundray	pain	you get a busybox shell?
2008-06-04T04:56:00.000Z	pain		Yes
2008-06-04T04:56:00.000Z	soundray	pain	does it tell you why?
2008-06-04T04:56:00.000Z	pain	soundray	no
2008-06-04T04:57:00.000Z	soundray	pain	which version of Ubuntu?
2008-06-04T04:57:00.000Z	pain	soundray	newest 8.04 (I think)
2008-06-04T04:58:00.000Z	soundray	pain	which installation method did you use -- booted the installer from CD, or installed from within Windows?
2008-06-04T04:59:00.000Z	pain	soundray	Install from inside windows.
2008-06-04T05:01:00.000Z	pain		Hello
2008-06-04T05:02:00.000Z	soundray	pain	aka wubi -- this is a bit experimental still. Your hardware seems to have problems with wubi. The best advice I can give you is to install Ubuntu on a dedicated partition after booting from the Desktop CD.
2008-06-04T05:03:00.000Z	pain	soundray	my computer is really old, I'm suprised it will even install Ubuntu. But I will try this, May I fancy a PM?
2008-06-04T05:05:00.000Z	soundray	pain	no, I'm logging off in a minute. Do ask the channel again, though. I'll get the bot to send you a few helpful messages via pm. Also note that there are good video tutorials on the web, e.g. youtube.
