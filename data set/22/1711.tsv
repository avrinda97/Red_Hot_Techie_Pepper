2010-02-10T08:50:00.000Z	mattgyver		Hey guys, is there a way to recognize 4gb of ram in ubuntu without using the 64bit version?
2010-02-10T08:50:00.000Z	DaemonFC	mattgyver	Yes, use the PAE kernel
2010-02-10T08:50:00.000Z	mattgyver	DaemonFC	thanks ill look into it :)
2010-02-10T08:51:00.000Z	DaemonFC	mattgyver	I believe the PAE kernel can address up to 48 GB of RAM
2010-02-10T08:52:00.000Z	DaemonFC	mattgyver	Another thing you could do is use the 64-bit kernel on your 32-bit Ubuntu system
2010-02-10T08:52:00.000Z	mattgyver	DaemonFC	okay.. any idea whats the best most stable method?
2010-02-10T08:52:00.000Z	DaemonFC	mattgyver	Use the X86-64 version of Ubuntu is the best thing to do
2010-02-10T08:53:00.000Z	DaemonFC		PAE is kind of hacky and may aggravate some 3rd party driver
2010-02-10T08:53:00.000Z	mattgyver	DaemonFC	I would do that but ive just heard there are a lot of application compatibilty issues with the 64bit, and im not really ready to go that route yet
2010-02-10T08:53:00.000Z	DaemonFC		it's also a bit slower than the native addressing in the 64-bit kernel
2010-02-10T08:53:00.000Z	DaemonFC	mattgyver	There are no issues on the X86-64 version
2010-02-10T08:54:00.000Z	DaemonFC		there's 32-bit libraries that can be used for 32-bit compatibility
2010-02-10T08:54:00.000Z	DaemonFC		they're all brought in as dependences if you isntall Wine :)
2010-02-10T08:54:00.000Z	mattgyver		Okay, well then maybe ill dive into it, im about to reconfigure my system anyway in the next week or so cuz i got a new SSD to play with
2010-02-10T08:55:00.000Z	DaemonFC	mattgyver	The only reason to stay with 32-bit x86 version of Ubuntu is if your CPU does not support X86-64
2010-02-10T08:56:00.000Z	mattgyver	DaemonFC	then im a dummy cuz mine i deffinately a 64 bit :X
2010-02-10T08:57:00.000Z	DaemonFC	mattgyver	If you asked me in 2005/2006, I would have been insistent on staying with 32-bit x86 because the 32-bit compatibility libraries weren't really all there yet, but there's no good reason to not use X86-64 now
2010-02-10T08:58:00.000Z	mattgyver	DaemonFC	well ill deffinately give it a shot and see if it works out better for me, if it doesnt ill just roll back to 32bit
2010-02-10T08:58:00.000Z	DaemonFC		people liked to FUD X86-64 for a long time because of those early compatibility issues
2010-02-10T08:58:00.000Z	mattgyver	DaemonFC	that might be what i got traped in
2010-02-10T08:58:00.000Z	DaemonFC	mattgyver	Just bring in Wine and you'll have all the 32-bit compatibility environment you need because Wine depends on all of them
2010-02-10T08:58:00.000Z	mattgyver	DaemonFC	shall do :)
