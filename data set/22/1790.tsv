2011-04-30T23:29:00.000Z	bahamas		what should i do?
2011-04-30T23:29:00.000Z	bahamas		i've previously modified that file because i have a dual boot system
2011-04-30T23:30:00.000Z	osse	bahamas	how have you modified it? Which OS is the other one?
2011-04-30T23:30:00.000Z	bahamas	osse	i don't remember how i've modified it. the other OS is Windows XP
2011-04-30T23:31:00.000Z	osse	bahamas	I would suggest installing a new menu.lst. Grub has gotten pretty good at detect stuff lately.
2011-04-30T23:31:00.000Z	bahamas	osse	ok, thanks. i'll do that
2011-04-30T23:32:00.000Z	osse	bahamas	hold on. which versions are you upgrading from and to?
2011-04-30T23:32:00.000Z	bahamas	osse	^^
2011-04-30T23:33:00.000Z	osse	bahamas	is it too late? :P If I'm not mistaken 9.04 used grub, not grub2.
2011-04-30T23:33:00.000Z	osse	bahamas	I would still install a new one though, but make a backup of the original
2011-04-30T23:33:00.000Z	bahamas	osse	i already went ahead with the installation, if that's what you mean by "too late"
2011-04-30T23:34:00.000Z	osse	bahamas	it'll probably be fine. It's been a long time since I've had to modify the grub menu manually
2011-04-30T23:36:00.000Z	bahamas	osse	ok. another question: the installer is telling me that postgres 8.3 is obsolete but still installed and that i should install the latest packages. should i do that now or wait until the upgrading process finishes?
2011-04-30T23:36:00.000Z	osse	bahamas	but I apologize in advance if it turns out I've given som incredibly stupid advice.
2011-04-30T23:37:00.000Z	bahamas	osse	it's okay. i imagine it's not that hard to edit menu.lst again
2011-04-30T23:37:00.000Z	osse	bahamas	I would wait. In reality I don't think you have a choice since the package manager thingy is in use by the upgrade process.
2011-04-30T23:38:00.000Z	bahamas	osse	ok. i've moving forward
2011-04-30T23:39:00.000Z	osse	bahamas	I think I gotten the question about menu.lst before without me even changing the file myself at all. If you can't remember how you modified it it probably wasn't important :P Stuff like which is where on the menu and timeout and all that is easy to change. Are you going through a chain of upgrades or are you stopping at 9.10 ?
2011-04-30T23:40:00.000Z	bahamas	osse	well, my computer is pretty old. would a version newer than 9.10 work okay?
2011-04-30T23:41:00.000Z	bahamas	osse	i have a 2600 athlon cpu and 512 ram, iirc
2011-04-30T23:43:00.000Z	osse	bahamas	I'm not really sure. I can't think of anything that should make it slower except for fancier desktop effects which you can turn off.
2011-04-30T23:44:00.000Z	bahamas	osse	ah. ok. i think i'll wait though because this upgrade took about 2 hours, and i don't have the patience to wait more
