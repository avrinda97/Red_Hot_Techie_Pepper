2010-07-11T19:38:00.000Z	nicofs		Where can i set which kernel is booted? I just installed one, but it isn't used...
2010-07-11T19:39:00.000Z	MaRk-I	nicofs	if you installed through synaptic you need to reboot
2010-07-11T19:39:00.000Z	nicofs	MaRk-I	used terminal and rebooted... both 2 times...
2010-07-11T19:40:00.000Z	MaRk-I	nicofs	what's the output of:  uname -ar   ?
2010-07-11T19:41:00.000Z	nicofs	MaRk-I	Linux nicofs-netbook 2.6.32-23-generic #37-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jun 11 07:54:58 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux
2010-07-11T19:42:00.000Z	MaRk-I	nicofs	is that the old kernel showing up?
2010-07-11T19:43:00.000Z	nicofs	MaRk-I	that's not the one i installed... i guess it's the old one... i didn't check what the old one was...
2010-07-15T17:27:00.000Z	MaRk-I	nicofs	you could black list wmi
2010-07-15T17:27:00.000Z	nicofs	MaRk-I	how do i do that?
2010-07-15T17:28:00.000Z	MaRk-I	nicofs	what do you get in terminal with:  lsmod | grep acer-wmi
2010-07-15T17:29:00.000Z	nicofs	MaRk-I	nothing
2010-07-15T17:29:00.000Z	MaRk-I	nicofs	then you could try blacklisting it
2010-07-15T17:30:00.000Z	nicofs	MaRk-I	and how do i do that?
2010-07-15T17:31:00.000Z	MaRk-I	nicofs	do this:  sudo updatedb && locate blacklist.conf
2010-07-15T17:32:00.000Z	nicofs	MaRk-I	done. and now?
2010-07-15T17:32:00.000Z	MaRk-I	nicofs	did it tell you where's the blacklist.conf file?
2010-07-15T17:33:00.000Z	nicofs	MaRk-I	yes. open it in editor?
2010-07-15T17:33:00.000Z	MaRk-I	nicofs	yes gksu gedit
2010-07-15T17:34:00.000Z	nicofs	MaRk-I	i assume something like "blacklist acer-wmi" ?
2010-07-15T17:35:00.000Z	MaRk-I	nicofs	correct, add that line, save it and restart the pc, check if you get the error
2010-07-15T17:38:00.000Z	nicofs	MaRk-I	apparently it worked. Thanks for that.
2010-07-15T17:38:00.000Z	MaRk-I	nicofs	yw
