2006-07-20T11:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	prophet	if you can't install build-essential, there's something wrong with your sources.list... can you pastebin that?
2006-07-20T11:11:00.000Z	Madpilot	prophet	use the URL that humanpersonman just posted, put your sources.list there
2006-07-20T11:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	prophet	open a terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal) then do 'sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list'
2006-07-20T11:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	prophet	then copy/paste your sources.list file onto that pastebin site, and past ONLY the URL of that here
2006-07-20T11:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	prophet	good, now paste ONLY the pastebin URL you got here
2006-07-20T11:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	prophet	yes, that... looking now
2006-07-20T11:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	prophet	did you remove all the # characters from that file?
2006-07-20T11:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	prophet	don't do that
2006-07-20T11:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	prophet	Use this sources.list instead: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17674
2006-07-20T11:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	prophet	we fixed the places your computer was looking when it was trying to install stuff
2006-07-20T12:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	prophet	it's PDT right now
2006-07-20T12:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	prophet	look for Portland or one of the other big cities in Oregon
2006-07-20T12:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	prophet	either LA or Vancouver are in your timezone
2006-07-20T12:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	prophet	Boise is in Mountain TZ, that's why you're an hour out
