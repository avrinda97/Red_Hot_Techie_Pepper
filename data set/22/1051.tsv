2011-03-16T19:05:00.000Z	Grav		Is it me or there is something wrong with how ubuntu manages memory? I have 2GB RAM. After some time my memory is full, and everything freezes or crashes
2011-03-16T19:06:00.000Z	ruan	Grav	is an application taking all of the memory?
2011-03-16T19:06:00.000Z	ruan	Grav	check in system monitor, memory tab
2011-03-16T19:11:00.000Z	Grav	ruan	Yes. Applications are taking memory. I'm trying to run firefox and some other things like IDE, and it grows and grows in memory and freezes system. Ubunt can't clear it. Only sometimes it will kill random processes.
2011-03-16T19:11:00.000Z	ruan	Grav	which applications are taking memory?
2011-03-16T19:11:00.000Z	ruan	Grav	how much memory does the application take?
2011-03-16T19:11:00.000Z	ruan	Grav	what is your swap memory size?
2011-03-16T19:13:00.000Z	Grav	ruan	well now it looks like one tab in chrome is taking 450MB, firefox is taking 300mb ...
2011-03-16T19:14:00.000Z	Grav	ruan	I can disable them but it will grow anyway in few hours
2011-03-16T19:14:00.000Z	Grav	ruan	yes
2011-03-16T19:14:00.000Z	Grav	ruan	If i run virtualbox or rubymine ide i will kill my system now
2011-03-16T19:15:00.000Z	Grav	ruan	i'm not sure too if i got swap, there is none in system monitor
2011-03-16T19:15:00.000Z	ruan	Grav	what is the output of 'free' in a terminal then?
2011-03-16T19:15:00.000Z	ruan	Grav	and swap?
2011-03-16T19:16:00.000Z	ruan	Grav	does swapon -a enable swap?
2011-03-16T19:17:00.000Z	Grav	ruan	 swapon -a in terminal does nothing?
2011-03-16T19:18:00.000Z	ruan	Grav	is there a swap partition then? sudo fdisk -l
2011-03-16T19:20:00.000Z	ruan	Grav	is there one judging from the output from sudo fdisk -l?
2011-03-16T19:20:00.000Z	ruan	Grav	do you have pastebinit installed?
2011-03-16T19:21:00.000Z	ruan	Grav	ok.
2011-03-16T19:23:00.000Z	ruan	Grav	there isn't much reason to run firefox and chrome at the same time though
