2005-01-08T08:47:00.000Z	amh		I have an ASUS A8V mobo, AMD64 3500+, 2 SATA harddrives on the Promise sata controller, WindowsXP on one harddrive and i want to install Ubuntu on the other but I want to make sure this will work or I will need to reinstall windows and I dont want to do that.  My video card is nvidia 6800GT.  Would I have problems installing Ubuntu?  Fedora 2 works but Fedora 3 doesnt and I would like to...
2005-01-08T08:47:00.000Z	amh		...give Ubuntu a try.
2005-01-08T08:49:00.000Z	amh		Im concerned with booting to windows

2005-01-08T08:51:00.000Z	amh		So will Ubuntu work with nvidia 6800gt and will the kernel use my promise sata controller?(asus a8v mobo)?
2005-01-08T08:52:00.000Z	ogra	amh	for nvidia: https://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/BinaryDriverHowto
2005-01-08T08:53:00.000Z	ogra	amh	two commands and one reboot to install the driver ;)
2005-01-08T08:54:00.000Z	ogra	amh	nope, after first boot your system is configured with the free nv driver and drops you directly in a configured X....the two are for the nvidia binary driver from nvidia ;)
2005-01-08T08:59:00.000Z	ogra	amh	by default grub is used
2005-01-08T08:59:00.000Z	ogra	amh	and if you run into any probs we are all here in the cosy cradle of the #ubuntu community ;)

2005-01-08T09:31:00.000Z	ogra	amh	thats the point of ubuntu (heavy python usage everywhere)
