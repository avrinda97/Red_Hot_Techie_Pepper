2008-04-24T07:11:00.000Z	CyberCod	marcel	 what is the last thing that happened to it?
2008-04-24T07:11:00.000Z	marcel	CyberCod	it's a external HDD, i pluged it in, and it was marked as unallocated
2008-04-24T07:13:00.000Z	CyberCod	marcel	  what was the last system you had it plugged into... this same one?
2008-04-24T07:13:00.000Z	marcel	CyberCod	yes
2008-04-24T07:13:00.000Z	CyberCod	marcel	been close to any big magnets?
2008-04-24T07:13:00.000Z	marcel	CyberCod	and a windows dual boot before that
2008-04-24T07:13:00.000Z	marcel	CyberCod	no
2008-04-24T07:13:00.000Z	marcel	CyberCod	its been sitting where it is for about 6 months
2008-04-24T07:13:00.000Z	CyberCod	marcel	  what is the filesystem on it?
2008-04-24T07:14:00.000Z	marcel	CyberCod	NTFS
2008-04-24T07:14:00.000Z	CyberCod		there ARE data recovery centers that can take it apart physically and extract your data... but it is costly.  If the data is worth that much trouble and expense, that is the safest option
2008-04-24T07:15:00.000Z	CyberCod	marcel	 in all likelihood, its just the MBR and partition table that got bunked, and the data is still there
2008-04-24T07:16:00.000Z	marcel	CyberCod	i used testdisk and it came up with nothing
2008-04-24T07:16:00.000Z	CyberCod		if you had a backup of the partition table, (which I'm assuming you don't) you could just restore it... but without knowing EXACTLY what partitions were on it and where they started and ended precicely, you could just ruin all your data
2008-04-24T07:18:00.000Z	CyberCod		there is a small utility included with Partition Magic for Windoze that lets you edit the partition table directly... it may be able to get you closer to restoring the proper partition settings.  I don't know what the proper tool would be for linux.  I just use dd to backup and restore mine.  but you can't restore what you don't have backed up
2008-04-24T07:19:00.000Z	marcel	CyberCod	Plz tell me i can get it back
2008-04-24T07:19:00.000Z	marcel	CyberCod	theres some 400+gb of work on that that i simply cant loose
2008-04-24T07:20:00.000Z	CyberCod	marcel	you most likely can, if you unplug it right now, package it nicely and send it off to a data center.  If you keep futzing around with it, chances are you will lose it all.  Are you prepared to spend a couple hundred to get your data back?  If so, thats your answer.
2008-04-24T07:21:00.000Z	marcel	CyberCod	any other options?
