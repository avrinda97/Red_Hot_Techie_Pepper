2009-05-14T16:58:00.000Z	mib_qgfeh6		hello to all
2009-05-14T16:59:00.000Z	mib_qgfeh6		what is the best way to make 9.04 32bit "see" 4Gb of RAM?
2009-05-14T16:59:00.000Z	mib_qgfeh6		sorry for being on Mibbit, darn firewall
2009-05-14T17:00:00.000Z	mib_qgfeh6		i was told to install the server kernel but i am worried about losing modules and/or something else changing
2009-05-14T17:00:00.000Z	mib_qgfeh6		wouldn't it be better to recompile the stock kernel, only adding HIGHMEM64?
2009-05-14T17:00:00.000Z	mib_qgfeh6		or am I saying stupid things? :-)
2009-05-14T17:01:00.000Z	flintwingel	mib_qgfeh6	why do you not want to use a 64bit OS
2009-05-14T17:02:00.000Z	mib_qgfeh6	flintwingel	i have already installed everything and started working on this machine :-)
2009-05-14T17:02:00.000Z	mib_qgfeh6		also, the 64bit kernel has the same issue
2009-05-14T17:02:00.000Z	mib_qgfeh6		the stock kernels don't see 4Gb of RAM
2009-05-14T17:03:00.000Z	mib_qgfeh6		also, not everything plays nice with 64bit
2009-05-14T17:03:00.000Z	flintwingel	mib_qgfeh6	the 64bit kernel will, but you can't just copy  the 64bit kernel onto a 32bit install
2009-05-14T17:03:00.000Z	mib_qgfeh6	flintwingel	that's why i want to enable highmem on 32bit :-) it should be quite easy
2009-05-14T17:03:00.000Z	mib_qgfeh6		btw, are the server kernels really THAT different?
2009-05-14T17:04:00.000Z	flintwingel	mib_qgfeh6	you need to recompile the 32 bit kernel with the PAE extension
2009-05-14T17:04:00.000Z	flintwingel	mib_qgfeh6	but  its not good for performance
2009-05-14T17:05:00.000Z	mib_qgfeh6	flintwingel	and that's where i am stuck. i am following https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile, but i can't figure out how to configure the kernel
2009-05-14T17:05:00.000Z	mib_qgfeh6		i was used to make menuconfig
2009-05-14T17:06:00.000Z	mib_qgfeh6		but that guide (the "ubuntu" way) wants me to edit a config file i can't even find :-)
2009-05-14T17:07:00.000Z	flintwingel	mib_qgfeh6	kernel compile is not something you should do lightly
2009-05-14T17:08:00.000Z	flintwingel	mib_qgfeh6	if you only need is to use >3.5G RAM use the 64bit version
2009-05-14T17:08:00.000Z	flintwingel	mib_qgfeh6	I say t his for your onw peace of mind :)
