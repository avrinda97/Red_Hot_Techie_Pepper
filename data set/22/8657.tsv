2005-07-15T15:58:00.000Z	Ninwa		Does anybody know why Gnome every couple of hours or so randomly logouts?
2005-07-15T15:58:00.000Z	Ninwa		Is there a hotkey I may accidentally be pressing?
2005-07-15T15:59:00.000Z	Ninwa		Although the last time I wasn't even touching the keyboard.
2005-07-15T05:32:00.000Z	Ninwa		Is there a Linux command that I can use to restart services (e.g apache)
2005-07-15T05:32:00.000Z	mameluke	Ninwa	yes
2005-07-15T05:32:00.000Z	Ninwa	mameluke	Ok, thank you.
2005-07-15T05:32:00.000Z	mameluke	Ninwa	don't u want to know the command? ;)
2005-07-15T05:33:00.000Z	Ninwa	mameluke	Not if you wern't going to give it without making me fine tune my question, at least I know it exists now eh? :)
2005-07-15T05:33:00.000Z	Ninwa	mameluke	Okay yeah, what is it. :)
2005-07-15T05:34:00.000Z	mameluke	Ninwa	there are 2 ways i know.. i'll tell you both
2005-07-15T05:34:00.000Z	mameluke	Ninwa	both only work with sudo (ore as root)
2005-07-15T05:35:00.000Z	Ninwa	mameluke	That's expected, you're dealing with system services.
2005-07-15T05:35:00.000Z	mameluke	Ninwa	1) maybe you have a command calld apachctl or apache2ctl?
2005-07-15T05:35:00.000Z	Ninwa	mameluke	Yes.
2005-07-15T05:35:00.000Z	mameluke	Ninwa	e.g. apache2ctl restet <--- done ;)
2005-07-15T05:36:00.000Z	mameluke	Ninwa	and the cgray was even faster then me >_<
2005-07-15T05:36:00.000Z	Ninwa	mameluke	cgray, appreciate it.
2005-07-15T05:36:00.000Z	mameluke	Ninwa	 /etc/init.d/apache restart
2005-07-15T05:37:00.000Z	Ninwa	mameluke	It doesn't seem to work, oddly.
2005-07-15T05:37:00.000Z	mameluke	Ninwa	witch command?
2005-07-15T05:38:00.000Z	mameluke	Ninwa	 /etc/init.d/apache2 restart <- don't forget the 2 ;)
2005-07-15T05:39:00.000Z	mameluke	Ninwa	try with TAB, to find out how it's calles
