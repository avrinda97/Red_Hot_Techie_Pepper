2011-07-29T04:36:00.000Z	felipe_Brz		I would like some commands (like mkdir) not to require sudo permission anymore. Is that possible?
2011-07-29T04:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	felipe_Brz	yes it's possible
2011-07-29T04:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	felipe_Brz	it will need sudo and only sudoers will be able to do it but it won't require a password
2011-07-29T04:39:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	ActionParsnip	hmmm... I think what I really want is for a command not to require passwords, OR sudo
2011-07-29T04:39:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	ActionParsnip	 is that feasible?
2011-07-29T04:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	felipe_Brz	they will need to be in the admin group to use sudo, then the app will not ask for a password, you will lose all user control
2011-07-29T08:35:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	ActionParsnip	thank you
2011-07-30T00:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	felipe_Brz	it needs to be a member of the admin group so it can use sudo
2011-07-30T00:59:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	ActionParsnip	 admin group? Not 'sudo' group?
2011-07-30T00:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	felipe_Brz	no, in ubuntu its the admin group
2011-07-30T00:59:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	ActionParsnip	ok thanks
2011-07-30T00:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	felipe_Brz	if you su to a user who can use sudo and run:  groups    you will see
2011-07-30T01:01:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	ActionParsnip	The thing is that I'm using Filezilla, and I need to login as a user who can do these things I told you, but it can't be the root because Filezilla doesn't allow it.  I'm not sure whether the filezilla client will know it must type in 'sudo' every time it need to create a directoty or something like that
2011-07-30T01:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	felipe_Brz	then you will need to change the file ownerships etc so that the user has the right amount of access
2011-07-30T01:04:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	ActionParsnip	thank you
2011-07-30T04:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	felipe_Brz	you changed your hostname in /etc/hostname   but not in /etc/hosts
2011-07-30T04:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	felipe_Brz	you now need to reboot to root recovery mode and make the hostname in /etc/hostname resolve to 127.0.0.1 or sudo will not work
2011-07-30T05:01:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	ActionParsnip	 hmmm It's funny that I am allowed to run command that would require sudo without typing sudo
2011-07-30T05:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	felipe_Brz	that resolution needs to happen. Currently the OS cannot communicate between services
2011-07-31T00:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	felipe_Brz	you can change the prompt colour easily

2011-07-31T00:41:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	ActionParsnip	ok i'll look into that. thanks
