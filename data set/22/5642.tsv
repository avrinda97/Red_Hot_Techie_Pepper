2007-03-28T14:40:00.000Z	dxdt	n00biee	I think patebin might be broken right now....
2007-03-28T14:41:00.000Z	dxdt	n00biee	yeah, and when you get the link for the apache2.conf lemme know
2007-03-28T14:41:00.000Z	n00biee	dxdt	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12476/
2007-03-28T14:46:00.000Z	dxdt	n00biee	sorry I meant /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
2007-03-28T14:47:00.000Z	n00biee	dxdt	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12477/
2007-03-28T14:50:00.000Z	dxdt	n00biee	ok, now what is in the file /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.load   one line of text that says LoadModule php5_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so correct?
2007-03-28T14:51:00.000Z	n00biee	dxdt	i'm back
2007-03-28T14:51:00.000Z	dxdt	n00biee	ok, now what is in the file /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.load   one line of text that says LoadModule php5_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so correct?
2007-03-28T14:53:00.000Z	dxdt	n00biee	 it has that line in it?
2007-03-28T14:57:00.000Z	n00biee	dxdt	yup.. still saving, not viewing
2007-03-28T15:01:00.000Z	dxdt	n00biee	 does /var/log/apache2/error.log  say anything?
2007-03-28T15:06:00.000Z	dxdt	n00biee	sorry I think I'm about out of ideas on this problem.  If you haven't tried a full restart I would try that next.  Maybe after that heading to #apache   this is usually a simple problem to fix, but I can't see what is being missed...
2007-03-28T15:08:00.000Z	dxdt	n00biee	but yeah as a last try, just reboot the whole machine and then you might want to check out #apache
2007-03-28T15:09:00.000Z	n00biee	dxdt	thanx
2007-03-28T15:12:00.000Z	dxdt	n00biee	hey are you still here?
2007-03-28T15:12:00.000Z	dxdt	n00biee	 we should check one more thing
