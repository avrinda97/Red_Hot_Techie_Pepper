2006-10-09T13:22:00.000Z	dyn-afk		if you have a root account with a password you know then it's very easy to fix
2006-10-09T13:22:00.000Z	dyn-afk		sudo -i will do that too anon32
2006-10-09T13:23:00.000Z	dyn-afk		besides that...su means that you become a different user
2006-10-09T13:23:00.000Z	dyn-afk		which sudo doesn't
2006-10-09T13:24:00.000Z	dyn-afk		su username means you become that user
2006-10-09T13:24:00.000Z	dyn-afk		sudo is only used to hand out some root privileges
2006-10-09T13:25:00.000Z	dyn-afk		su is different from that
2006-10-09T13:25:00.000Z	dyn-afk		if you don't set the right permissions on a file/dir you might run into problems with sudo and you need su -
2006-10-09T13:26:00.000Z	dyn-afk		sudo isn't a full root, su - is
2006-10-09T13:27:00.000Z	dyn-afk		why would you want to have grub as a bootloader for a livecd maXlo ?
2006-10-09T13:28:00.000Z	maXlo	dyn-afk	I need to edit the boot options (it's a long story :S)
2006-10-09T13:28:00.000Z	maXlo	dyn-afk	I need to boot a windows partition :(
2006-10-09T13:28:00.000Z	dyn-afk	maXlo	then boot with the livecd, mount the root partition on the harddrive and change the option for grub
2006-10-09T13:29:00.000Z	maXlo	dyn-afk	it is not that easy. i had to romeve linux from that hard disk (my boss...), and i need to boot to windows. unfotunately, i screwed up the mbr
2006-10-09T13:30:00.000Z	dyn-afk	maXlo	you want to restore your mbr so windows will boot again?
2006-10-09T13:31:00.000Z	maXlo	dyn-afk	yes.... and i do not have the CD
2006-10-09T13:31:00.000Z	maXlo	dyn-afk	it is my job
2006-10-09T13:31:00.000Z	maXlo	dyn-afk	sorry:
2006-10-09T13:31:00.000Z	maXlo	dyn-afk	it is my job's laptop, the do not have the CD
2006-10-09T13:32:00.000Z	maXlo	dyn-afk	the disk is a SCSI one... any bootdisk will do? dont i need some special driver?
2006-10-09T13:33:00.000Z	maXlo	dyn-afk	i will try... i have a win xp xp1 installation disk, but i doesnot recognize my hard disk, and it refuses to open a rescue console
2006-10-09T13:33:00.000Z	maXlo	dyn-afk	so, i can not run fixmbr :D
