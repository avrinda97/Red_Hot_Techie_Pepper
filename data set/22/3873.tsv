2008-11-17T00:24:00.000Z	towlie		how reliable is the badblocks command at detecting hardware errors on a hard drive ?
2008-11-17T00:24:00.000Z	joaopinto	towlie	just as reliable as your hardk disk can be, reporting read errors :)
2008-11-17T00:24:00.000Z	towlie	joaopinto	so i take it that you mean that it is reliable
2008-11-17T00:25:00.000Z	joaopinto	towlie	yes
2008-11-17T01:45:00.000Z	joaopinto	towlie	is 1000 your user gid ?
2008-11-17T01:45:00.000Z	towlie	joaopinto	yea i think so
2008-11-17T01:46:00.000Z	joaopinto	towlie	type "id" on the terminal to be sure
2008-11-17T01:48:00.000Z	towlie	joaopinto	yes it is 1000
2008-11-17T01:50:00.000Z	towlie	joaopinto	are you here
2008-11-17T01:51:00.000Z	joaopinto	towlie	remove that umask option, and just use the uid option on mount
2008-11-17T01:52:00.000Z	towlie	joaopinto	ok so my mount command currently is  sudo mount -o rw,uid=1000 /dev/hdb2 /mnt/2nd-backup/ but its still read only
2008-11-17T01:52:00.000Z	joaopinto	towlie	check "dmesg" for errors during mount
2008-11-17T01:53:00.000Z	towlie	joaopinto	no error
2008-11-17T01:53:00.000Z	joaopinto	towlie	that's odd :\
2008-11-17T02:02:00.000Z	joaopinto	towlie	what was the problem ?
2008-11-17T02:03:00.000Z	towlie	joaopinto	this mount option worked: sudo mount -o rw,umask=000,uid=1000,gid=1000 /dev/hdb2 /mnt/2nd-backup/
2008-11-17T02:03:00.000Z	towlie	joaopinto	for some reason the root folder of the dirve is read only but the subfolder is fully read write
2008-11-17T02:04:00.000Z	joaopinto	towlie	you only need uid, the others do not matter
2008-11-17T02:04:00.000Z	towlie	joaopinto	in my case it does
2008-11-17T02:04:00.000Z	joaopinto	towlie	have you tried to chown the mount point before doing issuing the mount command ?
2008-11-17T02:04:00.000Z	towlie	joaopinto	yes but the mount changes the perms so its pointless
2008-11-17T02:04:00.000Z	joaopinto	towlie	it does not, those other options didn't added anything :)
