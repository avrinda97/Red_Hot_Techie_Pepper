2009-04-05T05:49:00.000Z	PCTeacher012		what is the package? and versions of each package -- @nillo
2009-04-05T05:50:00.000Z	nillo	PCTeacher012	Xabacus is one; have seen it on others.  Let me see if I can figure out the versions...
2009-04-05T05:50:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	nillo	okay, waiting on response
2009-04-05T05:51:00.000Z	nillo	PCTeacher012	I see what the deal is with Xabacus; one for Motif, one for plain X.  Not sure that's the issue on others.  Thought the description was identical.
2009-04-05T05:52:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	nillo	ah, is it duplicated in the main menu? or somewhere else?
2009-04-05T05:53:00.000Z	nillo	PCTeacher012	I have "All" packages, selected.  Not sure what you mean by "main menu".
2009-04-05T05:54:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	nillo	The menu that has all your programs, and where you go into to look for programs, is it duplicted in there? or do you want to remove the package itself?
2009-04-05T05:56:00.000Z	nillo	PCTeacher012	I think the Xabacus listing is just confusing in the Add/Remove programs app; seems to be two distinct packages.  MountManager, OTOH, I think has two identical entries...checking.
2009-04-05T05:56:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	nillo	Xabacus has multiple types, from what i understand, and ill check too
2009-04-05T05:57:00.000Z	nillo	PCTeacher012	Agreed on Xabacus.  It's just confusing to someone less familiar, like me.  Not sure what the deal is with MountManager.
2009-04-05T05:58:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	nillo	Some people like different versions, and sometimes it is an addon
2009-04-05T05:59:00.000Z	nillo	PCTeacher012	So it is normal to have separate packages in a default install?  That's confusing to me.
2009-04-05T06:00:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	nillo	Sometimes, depending on the install, Xabacus "Motif Version" is just an addon to have extra functionality, while the plain X version is the orignal, both are stand alone, but one can add to the other
2009-04-05T06:01:00.000Z	nillo	PCTeacher012	I'm past Xabacus; I understand the difference there.  MountManager is what is confusing me now.
2009-04-05T06:01:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	nillo	Different Package?
2009-04-05T06:01:00.000Z	nillo	PCTeacher012	Yes.
2009-04-05T06:02:00.000Z	nillo	PCTeacher012	MountManager appears to have two identical entries.
2009-04-05T06:03:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	nillo	The entries are exactly the same, which is odd. Maybe two different members put it in without checking for another one. Either one will work fine
2009-04-05T06:04:00.000Z	nillo	PCTeacher012	Should I file a bug of some sort?  Either to avoid the confusion, or to resolve the duplication?
2009-04-05T06:04:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	nillo	Yes please
2009-04-05T06:05:00.000Z	nillo	PCTeacher012	Thanks; enough for one night.
2009-04-05T06:05:00.000Z	PCTeacher012	nillo	Your welcome
