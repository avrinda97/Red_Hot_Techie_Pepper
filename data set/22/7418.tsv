2006-04-12T08:27:00.000Z	Kilter		I'm running ubuntu as a server, but managed to install x.  how can I get it not to start x on boot, and kill it now that it's running?
2006-04-12T08:28:00.000Z	harisund	Kilter	What do you mean install x?
2006-04-12T08:28:00.000Z	harisund	Kilter	If you have installed the Gnome package completely (as in for example apt-get install ubuntu-desktop) you can stop the X windows by doing "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
2006-04-12T08:28:00.000Z	Kilter	harisund	I installed a base system and X is there.  I just want to have it not start up
2006-04-12T08:29:00.000Z	harisund	Kilter	ok.. can you try doing "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop" and could you report back if X windows is stopped?
2006-04-12T08:29:00.000Z	Kilter		yup, give me a second
2006-04-12T08:31:00.000Z	harisund	Kilter	Sure, Take your time. Besides how are you on IRC? If you are using Gaim or X Chat, then if X windows closes down so will that ...
2006-04-12T08:32:00.000Z	Kilter	harisund	using another computer :)
2006-04-12T08:32:00.000Z	Kilter		actually, oddly enough I'm not getting any feedback from the box when I plub a monitor up... how odd
2006-04-12T08:33:00.000Z	Kilter		plug too
2006-04-12T08:33:00.000Z	harisund	Kilter	Ok cool.. I didn't understand your last statment?
2006-04-12T08:33:00.000Z	Kilter		I plug a monitor in, I'm not getting anything.  no signal detected
2006-04-12T08:33:00.000Z	Kilter		but the box is on, I have an ssh window into it now
2006-04-12T08:33:00.000Z	Kilter		how odd
2006-04-12T08:33:00.000Z	harisund		Oh that's funny. You had the X windows on the monitor earlier?
2006-04-12T08:34:00.000Z	harisund	Kilter	Try pressing Alt+F1 or Ctrl+Alt+F1 on the computer?
2006-04-12T08:34:00.000Z	Kilter		yes, yesterday.  I just noticed that I'm using a lot of ram and thought I'd shut down somethings that were never being used.  X being the primary of those
2006-04-12T08:34:00.000Z	Kilter		ok, will do
2006-04-12T08:35:00.000Z	Kilter		only 256.  I wasn't running much on it until the other day though, I'm going to put some more in this weekend
2006-04-12T08:35:00.000Z	Kilter		hmm, actually, I might just shut it down now and do that...
2006-04-12T08:35:00.000Z	harisund		*only* 256? kelter
2006-04-12T08:35:00.000Z	harisund	Kilter	ok catch up with you later.. hope that worked.. bye !
