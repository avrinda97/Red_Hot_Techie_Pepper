2010-06-03T14:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Alchimista	can you expand on that problem a bit, "what" doesn't open "which" folders
2010-06-03T14:16:00.000Z	Alchimista	ikonia	for example, the documents folder does not open, from places option
2010-06-03T14:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Alchimista	what happens when you try to open Documents from the palces option ?
2010-06-03T14:17:00.000Z	Alchimista	ikonia	shows the indication that it's oppening, and then disapears
2010-06-03T14:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Alchimista	ok - do you know how to open a shell ?
2010-06-03T14:17:00.000Z	Alchimista	ikonia	shel? command line?

2010-06-03T14:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Alchimista	can you please do "cd ~/Documents"
2010-06-03T14:19:00.000Z	Alchimista	ikonia	i'm in the Documents, tell me things..
2010-06-03T14:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Alchimista	do "ls" - does it work ?
2010-06-03T14:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Alchimista	but you can see listings ?
2010-06-03T14:22:00.000Z	Alchimista	ikonia	no, i did the dir to see the content
2010-06-03T14:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Alchimista	I asked you to use the command "ls"
2010-06-03T14:22:00.000Z	Alchimista	ikonia	using that command it only shows a name, wich is from a sub folder
2010-06-03T14:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Alchimista	do you have pastebin init installed ?

2010-06-03T14:32:00.000Z	Alchimista	ikonia	after inserting that code, should i restart ubuntu?
2010-06-03T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Alchimista	that's a simple solultion yes
2010-06-03T14:40:00.000Z	Alchimista	ikonia	now with the ls, i can get a list of folders
