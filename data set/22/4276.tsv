2010-02-04T09:54:00.000Z	zedster	mrpink57	me
2010-02-04T09:54:00.000Z	mrpink57	zedster	have you checked your inttab?
2010-02-04T09:54:00.000Z	zedster	mrpink57	no, what should I look for?
2010-02-04T09:55:00.000Z	mrpink57	zedster	near the bottom you should see your tty's its an obvious
2010-02-04T09:55:00.000Z	mrpink57	zedster	basically it should show telling tty to run in runlevels
2010-02-04T09:56:00.000Z	zedster	mrpink57	how do I access it?
2010-02-04T09:57:00.000Z	mrpink57	zedster	don't go monking around in there too much, just look for your tty
2010-02-04T09:58:00.000Z	zedster	mrpink57	I don;t have any  /etc/inttab file
2010-02-04T10:00:00.000Z	mrpink57	zedster	where you able to open your inittab?
2010-02-04T10:00:00.000Z	zedster	mrpink57	I think inittab is no longer used
2010-02-04T10:00:00.000Z	zedster	mrpink57	no
2010-02-04T10:02:00.000Z	mrpink57	zedster	apparently ubuntu does not use a inittab they use what is called upstart and its in /etc/event.d/rc-default
2010-02-04T10:02:00.000Z	zedster	mrpink57	upstart replaced inittab
2010-02-04T10:02:00.000Z	mrpink57	zedster	however I do not know if the file follows the same setup as a standard inittab
2010-02-04T10:04:00.000Z	zedster	mrpink57	still not finding it
2010-02-04T10:05:00.000Z	mrpink57	zedster	there is nothing under what I gave /etc/event.d/rc-default?
2010-02-04T10:05:00.000Z	zedster	mrpink57	no, no event.d directory
2010-02-04T10:06:00.000Z	mrpink57	zedster	try locate rc-default
2010-02-04T10:06:00.000Z	zedster	mrpink57	nothing
2010-02-04T10:07:00.000Z	mrpink57	zedster	either it has been chagned or you do not have something you need.  this is where I give you some money for gas and we go our seperate ways.
2010-02-04T10:07:00.000Z	zedster	mrpink57	thanks for the help
