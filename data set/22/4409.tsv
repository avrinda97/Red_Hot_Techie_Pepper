2012-03-16T23:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	could try lightspark or gnash instead. If you use YouTube a lot try using minitube and you can watch vids without flash :-)
2012-03-16T23:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	open source alterative to adobe flash

2012-03-17T00:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	enable the universe repo
2012-04-08T23:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	what if you rename your chromium config folder?
2012-04-08T23:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	rename it  to something different, anythng will do, just something different. That applies to when anyone says 'rename the folder' etc
2012-04-08T23:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	the folder will be in ~/.config
2012-04-09T00:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	then you'll have a problem
2012-04-09T00:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	why is it so hard to just add something like the number 1 to the end of the file name, something simple...
2012-04-09T00:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	could've usd nautilus like you do with your other file manipulations
2012-04-09T00:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	ok, rerun the browser so you get a default profle, is it ok?
2012-04-09T00:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	then its something with your old profile that has been added, or that the newer version doesn't like a config setting in your old profile
2012-04-09T00:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	what is the output of:  uname -m; lsb_release -sc
2012-04-09T00:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	and the output of:  uname -m
2012-04-09T00:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	then enable the partner repo and install adobe-flashplugin
2012-04-09T00:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	yes, in software centre
2012-04-09T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianp1992	indeed
