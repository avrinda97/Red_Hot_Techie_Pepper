2006-06-03T08:04:00.000Z	robotgeek		hmm, is it too late to be asking breezy questions?
2006-06-03T08:05:00.000Z	|rt|	robotgeek	breezy was so yesterday
2006-06-03T08:27:00.000Z	robotgeek	|rt|	broadcom should work nicely in dapper, look at the wiki article
2006-06-03T08:27:00.000Z	|rt|	robotgeek	been looking at it but it's a bit confusing....mentioned apple hardware and some new non-ndiswrapper driver or something
2006-06-03T08:28:00.000Z	robotgeek	|rt|	hmm, which part do you find confusing?
2006-06-03T08:28:00.000Z	robotgeek	|rt|	the broadcom device works great under dapper, i'm on it right now :)
2006-06-03T08:28:00.000Z	|rt|	robotgeek	at the moment ndiswrapper seems to load the device
2006-06-03T08:29:00.000Z	|rt|	robotgeek	but it's not connecting to anything
2006-06-03T08:29:00.000Z	|rt|	robotgeek	are you using diswrapper?
2006-06-03T08:29:00.000Z	robotgeek	|rt|	no, the native driver
2006-06-03T08:29:00.000Z	|rt|	robotgeek	when did a native driver show up for broadcom?  thought they were being pricks about their specs
2006-06-03T08:30:00.000Z	|rt|	robotgeek	ok i'll follow the wiki and do it that way
2006-06-03T08:30:00.000Z	robotgeek	|rt|	the driver was reverse engineered, so it works great
2006-06-03T08:30:00.000Z	|rt|	robotgeek	what do you need in /etc/network/interfaces for it to work (i'm still trying to figure out all the ubuntu way of dealing with config)
2006-06-03T08:56:00.000Z	|rt|	robotgeek	doesn't look like the bcm43xx driver is working for me anybetter than the ndiswrapper
2006-06-03T08:56:00.000Z	|rt|	robotgeek	lsmod shows that the bcm43xx isn't being used by any devices
2006-06-03T08:56:00.000Z	robotgeek	|rt|	can you check your router logs?
2006-06-03T08:56:00.000Z	robotgeek	|rt|	iwconfig
2006-06-03T08:57:00.000Z	|rt|	robotgeek	that shows that it's set to any ESSID etc
2006-06-03T08:57:00.000Z	|rt|	robotgeek	but if i try to bring it up it doesn't connect (there is an open network here in the building)
2006-06-03T09:01:00.000Z	|rt|	robotgeek	ifconfig shows eth1 (my wireless device)
2006-06-03T09:01:00.000Z	|rt|	robotgeek	but I cant' get it to get a ip from dhcp
