2007-08-28T09:58:00.000Z	PoofDaddy		I just inherited a new computer and not too familiar with computers and I'm a new Ubuntu user. The computer gives me the following message: http://www.nopaste.com/p/asQKbvLKF
2007-08-28T09:59:00.000Z	preaction	PoofDaddy	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg-xserver i think
2007-08-28T10:01:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	preaction	Jordan_U : I can't seem to get to the terminal on that computer.  It looks almost like a BIOS setup window.  I'm using a different computer.
2007-08-28T10:01:00.000Z	preaction	PoofDaddy	when grub loads, choose "recovery mode"
2007-08-28T10:03:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	preaction	I don't think that it's an option on that machine cause I tried that and it didn't work.
2007-08-28T10:03:00.000Z	preaction	PoofDaddy	are you sure it's an ubuntu machine?
2007-08-28T10:03:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	preaction	yes, but i was directing that to Jordan, not you
2007-08-28T10:04:00.000Z	preaction	PoofDaddy	then why is my name at the front of it?
2007-08-28T10:04:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	preaction	I didn't see any line of kernal for recovery mode.  in fact it only loaded Ubuntu up and had no options for anything else as far as I know
2007-08-28T10:04:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	preaction	I'm sorry.  My mistake.
2007-08-28T10:05:00.000Z	preaction	PoofDaddy	fiesty? when grub boots you should have two seconds to press "esc" to see the full grub menu
2007-08-28T10:06:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	preaction	I will try that now
2007-08-28T10:11:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	preaction	i did it when i saw the option to hit esc, but it just boots to Ubuntu immediately.
2007-08-28T10:11:00.000Z	preaction	PoofDaddy	looks like someone configured grub to skip that menu. you'll have to use a live CD to recover your X
2007-08-28T10:12:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	preaction	that I have and that I will do
2007-08-28T10:24:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	preaction	ok I got a live CD running.  What should I do now?  Open a terminal and run some commands, right?  Which ones?
2007-08-28T10:25:00.000Z	preaction	PoofDaddy	the first thing you'll want to do is mount your hard drive with ubuntu on it. then you want to "chroot" to the place you mounted that partition. then you can do :
2007-08-28T10:29:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	preaction	that live CD hasn't finished booting.  There seems to be an error.  I'm using Helix, since i lost my Knoppix.  It says HELIX IMAGE is a squashfs compressed image.  Does that mean anything to you?
2007-08-28T10:30:00.000Z	preaction	PoofDaddy	nothing whatsoever. any problem with getting a new live cd?
2007-08-28T10:32:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	preaction	helix is knoppix-based: http://www.e-fense.com/helix/index.php
2007-10-27T02:12:00.000Z	preaction	PoofDaddy	one gets package lists, one gets packages that have been changed
2007-10-27T02:14:00.000Z	PoofDaddy	preaction	so should I run each of those commands equally as much as the other?  Maybe one after the other every time?
