2007-02-17T08:24:00.000Z	__Ace2016__		Well whenever i've run bittorrent i've had majour fragmentation
2007-02-17T08:24:00.000Z	__Ace2016__		so ext3 needs a defrag tool
2007-02-17T08:24:00.000Z	xtknight	__Ace2016__	how did you read fragmentation levels?
2007-02-17T08:25:00.000Z	__Ace2016__	xtknight	i read it based on what my hard disks sound like when using the downloaded files
2007-02-17T08:25:00.000Z	xtknight	__Ace2016__	that does not indicate fragmentation, it could be hitting the page file instead of cache
2007-02-17T08:26:00.000Z	xtknight	__Ace2016__	in that case you can tune your VM.  set vm.swappiness to 100 to make reducing cache a last resort?
2007-02-17T08:27:00.000Z	__Ace2016__	xtknight	i don't use a swap file
2007-02-17T08:27:00.000Z	__Ace2016__	xtknight	they are just tv episodes in a massive torrent thats all
2007-02-17T08:27:00.000Z	xtknight	__Ace2016__	odd.  what filesystem?
2007-02-17T08:27:00.000Z	__Ace2016__	xtknight	it used to be xfs and then ext3
2007-02-17T08:28:00.000Z	xtknight	__Ace2016__	i think i may have experienced the same fragfmentation with huge files (like vmware images), and that's when i started using xfs ;)  i can't remember the linux cmd to check fragmentation
2007-02-17T08:29:00.000Z	xtknight	__Ace2016__	i think the statement applies to MOST people, but certainly not everybody.  ext3 CAN fragment
2007-02-17T08:29:00.000Z	__Ace2016__	xtknight	how do you know it was in 700 segments? is there a checking app?
2007-02-17T08:29:00.000Z	xtknight	__Ace2016__	yes, i'm trying to find it
2007-02-17T08:30:00.000Z	xtknight	__Ace2016__	i think it was called 'extents' but maybe it was only an xfs utility
2007-02-17T08:31:00.000Z	xtknight	__Ace2016__	actually it's 'filefrag'
2007-02-17T08:32:00.000Z	__Ace2016__	xtknight	thanks
2007-02-17T08:44:00.000Z	xtknight	__Ace2016__	ouch
2007-02-17T08:46:00.000Z	xtknight	__Ace2016__	this might work ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/defrag/   not sure if it works for ext3, but ext3 is based off ext2 so it should
2007-02-17T08:47:00.000Z	xtknight	__Ace2016__	actually it's proably not a wise idea to try o nxet3
2007-02-17T08:47:00.000Z	xtknight	__Ace2016__	on ext3*
2007-02-17T08:49:00.000Z	__Ace2016__	xtknight	i'm reformatting it wtih xfs, but i need to burn 25dvds first, maybe more
