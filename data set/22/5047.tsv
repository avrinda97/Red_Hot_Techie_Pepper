2008-12-10T06:37:00.000Z	RequinB4		lorenze: try turning pcm up?
2008-12-10T06:38:00.000Z	lorenzo	RequinB4	how do i do that?
2008-12-10T06:38:00.000Z	RequinB4	lorenzo	alsamixer (in terminal)
2008-12-10T06:40:00.000Z	lorenzo		RaquinB4, yeah the master's up, capture is 0 but I guess that has nothing to do with it right?
2008-12-10T06:40:00.000Z	RequinB4	lorenzo	there should be a pcm slider
2008-12-10T06:40:00.000Z	RequinB4	lorenzo	or maybe not... nevermind
2008-12-10T06:41:00.000Z	lorenzo	RequinB4	I only got master, capture, all. that's it
2008-12-10T06:41:00.000Z	lorenzo	RequinB4	any other ideas?
2008-12-10T06:41:00.000Z	RequinB4	lorenzo	well, how quiet is it? really really quiet to the point you think something is wrong or just not as loud as you think it would be
2008-12-10T06:42:00.000Z	lorenzo	RequinB4	it's not superquiet but still quieter than on Gutsy
2008-12-10T06:42:00.000Z	RequinB4	lorenzo	what is your sound card (lspci)
2008-12-10T06:43:00.000Z	lorenzo		 Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02)
2008-12-10T06:44:00.000Z	lorenzo	RequinB4	 Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02)
2008-12-10T06:44:00.000Z	RequinB4	lorenzo	hey, that's my sound card
2008-12-10T06:45:00.000Z	RequinB4	lorenzo	I needed to add a new driver to get mine working
2008-12-10T06:45:00.000Z	lorenzo	RequinB4	ah really?
2008-12-10T06:45:00.000Z	RequinB4	lorenzo	and you should have pcm there somewhere
2008-12-10T06:45:00.000Z	RequinB4	lorenzo	yeah, but that was in feisty so idk
2008-12-10T06:45:00.000Z	lorenzo	RequinB4	I can see PCM in the alsa mixer from icontray
2008-12-10T06:45:00.000Z	RequinB4	lorenzo	do what fliegenderfrosch said
2008-12-10T06:46:00.000Z	RequinB4	lorenzo	remember best quality sound is at 74% PCM, loudest at 100%
2008-12-10T06:46:00.000Z	lorenzo	RequinB4	fliegenderfrosch, ok you have been very kind, thanks for your time!
