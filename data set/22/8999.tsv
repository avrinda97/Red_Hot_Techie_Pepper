2005-04-22T05:24:00.000Z	saik0		so after installing spamassassin and having spamd running is my evolution mailbox being filtered??
2005-04-22T05:25:00.000Z	Guerin	saik0	have you told evolution to pipe mail through spamassassin
2005-04-22T05:25:00.000Z	saik0	Guerin	nope I was assuming it was'nt going to be that easy. How does one do that
2005-04-22T05:26:00.000Z	Guerin	saik0	make a rule for every message smaller than 250k, and choose pipe through /usr/bin/spamc
2005-04-22T05:27:00.000Z	Guerin	saik0	250k is the biggest message spamc/d will defaultly process
2005-04-22T05:29:00.000Z	saik0	Guerin	am I doing this through a terminal, or the GUI somewhere
2005-04-22T05:29:00.000Z	Guerin	saik0	you do this in the evolution gui
2005-04-22T05:34:00.000Z	saik0	Guerin	seems I'm blind. Could you offer something a bit more point-here anc click-there cuz I'm not seeing how to pipe anything through anyting in evolution
2005-04-22T05:35:00.000Z	Guerin	saik0	tools -> filters ; add
2005-04-22T05:36:00.000Z	saik0	Guerin	all I see is Pilot Settings and Manage Plugins in the Tools menu
2005-04-22T05:37:00.000Z	Guerin	saik0	what version?
2005-04-22T05:38:00.000Z	Guerin	saik0	woah, I'm way behind, then
2005-04-22T05:38:00.000Z	Guerin	saik0	2.0.3
2005-04-22T05:38:00.000Z	saik0	Guerin	it would be nice to send it through clamd too
2005-04-22T05:39:00.000Z	Guerin	saik0	that's possible, too; using the same principle
2005-04-22T05:39:00.000Z	Guerin	saik0	just try to find the "filters" section
2005-04-22T05:39:00.000Z	saik0	Guerin	though spam is definetly more of a problem then virii in linux (for now anyways)
2005-04-22T05:40:00.000Z	Guerin	saik0	spamassassin will get most virus-laden mails as collateral damage
2005-04-22T05:42:00.000Z	saik0	Guerin	I've been annoyed with Evolution adn gpilot as of late. I am | this | close to removing it and installing JPilot and Thunderbird or Sylpheed
2005-04-22T05:42:00.000Z	Guerin	saik0	i just use mutt... i only know because I set it up for my wife
2005-04-22T05:56:00.000Z	Guerin	saik0	can you not find any sort of filter config?
2005-04-22T05:57:00.000Z	saik0	Guerin	noe to speak of in my version. I see 2 checkboxes and thats it
