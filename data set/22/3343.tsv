2008-10-07T09:43:00.000Z	Lul2x		I'm basically looking for a good backup method and I thought RAID was the answer... now I'm having my doubts.
2008-10-07T09:44:00.000Z	Ward1983	Lul2x	for just data / files scp works well and pretty secure
2008-10-07T09:49:00.000Z	Ward1983	Lul2x	well if your power supply decides to go insane and breaks your drives you would have a problem (it doesnt happen much but you never know)
2008-10-07T09:49:00.000Z	Lul2x	Ward1983	that's a good point...
2008-10-07T09:49:00.000Z	Ward1983	Lul2x	you could take the drive out and only put it in to backup stuff
2008-10-07T09:50:00.000Z	Ward1983	Lul2x	but i wouldnt recommend that either to be honest
2008-10-07T09:50:00.000Z	Lul2x	Ward1983	I know that is probably a better idea but I know I will get lazy and want a "set it and forget it" option, lol
2008-10-07T09:51:00.000Z	Ward1983	Lul2x	there are these cheap ass sleds for drives, exist for both IDE and SATA :)
2008-10-07T09:51:00.000Z	Ward1983	Lul2x	those are pretty conveniant
2008-10-07T09:51:00.000Z	Lul2x	Ward1983	hmmm, may be worth looking into
2008-10-07T09:52:00.000Z	Ward1983	Lul2x	or get a good case which allows you to slide the drives out :p
2008-10-07T09:56:00.000Z	Ward1983	Lul2x	the server is ok, but you sohuld have a backup aswell imo
2008-10-07T09:57:00.000Z	Ward1983	Lul2x	preferably a different machine or even different location
2008-10-07T09:59:00.000Z	Lul2x	Ward1983	I agree. I just don't have another machine that is always going, which is part of my problem
2008-10-07T10:01:00.000Z	Ward1983	Lul2x	depends what speed your wireless connection has
2008-10-07T10:01:00.000Z	Ward1983	Lul2x	lol gigabit is WAY faster then any wireless
2008-10-07T10:02:00.000Z	Ward1983	Lul2x	if you dont use raw pictures or any craszy large resolutions it should work fine
2008-10-07T10:03:00.000Z	Lul2x	Ward1983	I work  a lot with RAW so the file sizes to get big >_<
2008-10-07T10:03:00.000Z	Ward1983	Lul2x	then wireless is probably a bit slow :p
2008-10-07T10:04:00.000Z	Ward1983	Lul2x	you should mention that next time, people tend to think jpeg if they read pictures
2008-10-07T10:04:00.000Z	Lul2x	Ward1983	yeah, sorry about that!
2008-10-07T10:04:00.000Z	Ward1983	Lul2x	no problem at all just a tip
