2008-11-22T04:25:00.000Z	unlink		the only thing i haven't tried is manually compiling a driver -- but that is not an option because i will not be present for future upgrades
2008-11-22T04:26:00.000Z	fde	unlink	keep things to one line, makes it easier to follow you... what exactly is your issue?
2008-11-22T04:28:00.000Z	fde	unlink	no offense, but you should have thought about that when purchasing the hardware... you can just lock the kernel at the current version though if everything works fine  :/
2008-11-22T04:28:00.000Z	unlink	fde	i didn't purchase the hardware, i'm helping someone else installl linux
2008-11-22T04:29:00.000Z	fde	unlink	see the bottom of that wiki page... they insisted on keeping the holding info on that page I guess...
2008-11-22T04:29:00.000Z	fde	unlink	I wrote the top part
2008-11-22T04:30:00.000Z	fde	unlink	that way, if you hold it, the kernel won't be upgraded ever again until the option is turned off manually... so you don't have to worry, but you might have to guide them through any security updated that might be an issue
2008-11-22T04:31:00.000Z	unlink	fde	yeah, i know about apt pinning, but that means no security fixes in the kernel
2008-11-22T04:31:00.000Z	fde	unlink	the top part is pinning, the bottom part is holding... hate that they confuse those two...
2008-11-22T04:33:00.000Z	fde	unlink	your options are: 1) replace the wireless nic with something better supported; 2) hold the kernel and lack security updates; 3) teach the user how to compile the drivers themselves when required; 4) Use an OS with better support for Atheros stuff... that's it.
2008-11-22T04:33:00.000Z	fde	unlink	Linux is accepting a lot of Atheros drivers right now... but apparently yours isn't there yet
2008-11-22T04:33:00.000Z	unlink	fde	do you know any distributions which have this packaged?
2008-11-22T04:34:00.000Z	fde	unlink	if ubuntu doesn't, no one does.
2008-11-22T04:34:00.000Z	fde	unlink	Ubuntu is about as lenient as it gets with non-gpl drivers
2008-11-22T04:34:00.000Z	unlink	fde	true but some (like sid) are more up-tod-ate
2008-11-22T04:35:00.000Z	fde	unlink	not really, afaik, sid froze some months ago for the release on lenny sometime in the next decade
2008-11-22T04:37:00.000Z	unlink	fde	i'm just very surprised that ndiswrapper didn't work... /var/log/messages even listed the encryption capabilities of wlan09
2008-11-22T04:37:00.000Z	fde	unlink	there are a lot of kernel developers fighting to get ndiswrapper to never be able to work...
2008-11-22T04:39:00.000Z	fde	unlink	if your card is listed on Fougner's link, use that... ndiswrapper is a horrible solution, and is considered illegal and unwelcomed.
2008-11-22T04:40:00.000Z	fde	unlink	it links Windows binary drivers into the linux kernel, against code that is GPL only... so it causes quite the stir
2008-11-22T04:40:00.000Z	unlink	fde	i know what it does
2008-11-22T04:52:00.000Z	fde	unlink	currently, I don't think Jaunty is being populated with anything new
