2007-03-06T11:05:00.000Z	ITS_FOR_REAL		Got problem choosing installer. i will run lamp on this computer but will also use it as a desktop... so wich installer should i choose then? :S
2007-03-06T11:05:00.000Z	LjL	ITS_FOR_REAL	it doesn't really matter, you can always install packages later.
2007-03-06T11:05:00.000Z	LjL		!lamp > ITS_FOR_REAL    (ITS_FOR_REAL, see the private message from Ubotu)
2007-03-06T11:07:00.000Z	ITS_FOR_REAL	LjL	yeah sure i know that... just curious what i will miss fresh out of the box in both cases ;)
2007-03-06T11:07:00.000Z	ITS_FOR_REAL	LjL	have they cut down on media progs in server version? etc
2007-03-06T11:08:00.000Z	ITS_FOR_REAL	LjL	do they both got simliar x?
2007-03-06T11:08:00.000Z	LjL	ITS_FOR_REAL	if you use the desktop CD, you will have the ubuntu-desktop package installed. same if you use alternate/minimal and install the desktop version. otherwise, you'll only have ubuntu-standard and/or ubuntu-minimal installed.
2007-03-06T11:08:00.000Z	LjL	ITS_FOR_REAL	the server version comes with no X at all.
2007-03-06T11:08:00.000Z	LjL		!server
2007-03-06T11:09:00.000Z	ITS_FOR_REAL	LjL	thats the answer i was looking for....  need x to go with.. or it will help anyway! thx alot
2007-03-06T11:10:00.000Z	LjL	ITS_FOR_REAL	but it does by no means mean that you can't install X later... it's a matter of doing "sudo apt-get install thedesktopyouwant", really. if you're unsure, use the minimal CD, that's only an 8 megs download, and it'll get the rest (whatever you tell it to get) off the net

2007-03-06T11:11:00.000Z	ITS_FOR_REAL	LjL	yeah sure i "know" but i got answer what i was looking for! thx alot
2007-03-06T11:14:00.000Z	ITS_FOR_REAL	LjL	since i will use it as a desktop with irc msn xmms etc etc it will prob be easier and faster to go with desktop. then install lamp. thats what i did last i tried and it worked out nice. just wondered if it was any huge bennefit going for server version instead but it doesnt sound so for me
2007-03-06T11:15:00.000Z	LjL	ITS_FOR_REAL	the server version comes with a tweaked kernel, that's all. but then if you're going to do desktop stuff, you don't want the tweaked kernel.
2007-03-06T11:15:00.000Z	ITS_FOR_REAL	LjL	yeah great
2007-03-06T11:15:00.000Z	LjL	ITS_FOR_REAL	and note that when i say "server version" i don't mean the "server" option in the alternate or minimal CDs, because they're two different things
2007-03-06T11:16:00.000Z	ITS_FOR_REAL		hehe yeah!!
2007-03-06T11:16:00.000Z	ITS_FOR_REAL	LjL	im stupid... but not that...
2007-03-06T11:16:00.000Z	ITS_FOR_REAL		:D
2007-03-06T11:16:00.000Z	LjL	ITS_FOR_REAL	it never seemed very obvious to me that there was a difference.
2007-03-06T11:18:00.000Z	ITS_FOR_REAL	LjL	hehe yeah ok. whats obvious to one... might not be obvious to another so its always good to tell it all ;)
