2006-06-24T13:44:00.000Z	scott__		please help me retrieve it back
2006-06-24T13:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	scott__	you can use a windows reccovery program.  I would try to get an image of the ipod before going any further.
2006-06-24T13:47:00.000Z	scott__	Jack_Sparrow	how would i go about doing that?
2006-06-24T13:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	scott__	do you have a ms box available?
2006-06-24T13:47:00.000Z	scott__	Jack_Sparrow	no :(
2006-06-24T13:48:00.000Z	scott__	Jack_Sparrow	ive found a windows program that says it will recover songs from an ipod though, trying it through wine atm
2006-06-24T13:49:00.000Z	scott__	Jack_Sparrow	program doesn runt under wine :(
2006-06-24T13:51:00.000Z	scott__	Jack_Sparrow	 true, will ave to go down a mates house, still annoying :(
2006-06-24T13:56:00.000Z	scott__	Jack_Sparrow	 just plugged my ipod back in, rythm box can see ALL the songs on it (and play them) only they arent all listed on my ipod, so it seems the ipod databse on the ipod has got corrupt? any way i can fix this?
2006-06-24T13:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	scott__	I dont know about that, I would pull them with rythem and save them to your PC the when you push them back Ipod should see them
2006-06-24T14:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	scott__	WIll acdeesee work under wine? There is an Ipod plugin for it that really works well..
2006-06-24T14:01:00.000Z	scott__	Jack_Sparrow	not a clue, never used it before :), trying gtkpod see if its got anything in there that could fix it
2006-06-24T14:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	scott__	can you mount it as a drive?
2006-06-24T14:03:00.000Z	scott__	Jack_Sparrow	yes, ive got it mounted atm, rythmbox and gtkpod can see ALL my songs, but on my ipod i can only see a few....
2006-06-24T14:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	scott__	 since it is mounted you should be able to copy them to a different location
2006-06-24T14:04:00.000Z	scott__	Jack_Sparrow	if worst comes to worst i will copy them off ipod to pc then back to ipod, but it means i will loose play counts, play lists etc
2006-06-24T14:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	scott__	that is better than losing all your music..
2006-06-24T14:05:00.000Z	scott__	Jack_Sparrow	definately :), cheers for ur help so far :()
2006-06-24T14:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	scott__	I loaded up the wifes Ipod once and havent messed with it much since
2006-06-24T14:07:00.000Z	scott__	Jack_Sparrow	lol
2008-03-13T01:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	scott__	yes
