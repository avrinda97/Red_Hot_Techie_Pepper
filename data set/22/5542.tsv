2007-04-19T06:23:00.000Z	delire	Zs	paste it in a pastebin.
2007-04-19T06:27:00.000Z	delire	Zs	i have no idea what your error is. please paste it in a pastebin
2007-04-19T06:27:00.000Z	delire	Zs	that's not information.
2007-04-19T06:27:00.000Z	delire	Zs	paste error output in a pastebin
2007-04-19T06:29:00.000Z	Zs	delire	what is pastebin, how to use?
2007-04-19T06:29:00.000Z	delire	Zs	paste the output to http://pastebin.com and describe the error in the same page: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2007-04-19T06:39:00.000Z	delire	Zs	and what's the problem. what doesn't work?
2007-04-19T06:40:00.000Z	delire	Zs	that's fine. you have two new kernels when you upgraded, so they were added to grub's menu.lst
2007-04-19T06:41:00.000Z	delire	Zs	each time a new kernel is installed, a new entry will be made in that list. if you don't want the old ones in there, you can remove them, but be very careful and be sure to back up your /boot/grub/menu.1st first.
2007-04-19T06:42:00.000Z	delire	Zs	i would leave what you have there alone. that's not a long list. on my current (Debian) machine i have about 15 kernels.
2007-04-19T06:43:00.000Z	delire	Zs	yes all you need to do is delete the lines. remember that for each new kernel added, there is a 'recovery' entry added. you only really have 2 kernels there! that's fine. leave it.
