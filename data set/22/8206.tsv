2005-10-01T13:42:00.000Z	boboboka		hello there
2005-10-01T13:42:00.000Z	boboboka		was wondering, how can I update my gaim ?
2005-10-01T13:43:00.000Z	boboboka		hey zblach.
2005-10-01T13:43:00.000Z	delire	boboboka	'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gaim' is the fast way.
2005-10-01T13:44:00.000Z	delire	boboboka	or just start up synaptic, update and then install gaim. there may not be a super recent version in the repository yet though.
2005-10-01T13:45:00.000Z	delire	boboboka	it may not be in the ubuntu repository yet.. hmm.
2005-10-01T13:46:00.000Z	delire	boboboka	well if you can stand waiting, i would. it might only be a week or so til it's packaged for ubuntu. otherwise remove game using synaptic and install it straight from a tarball, eg download it from their site.
2005-10-01T13:46:00.000Z	delire	boboboka	s/game/gaim ;) my mistake.
2005-10-01T13:49:00.000Z	delire	boboboka	i use dpkg-reconfigure locales to do this, but it's not reccommended for you. there may be a way in Gnome to set the default locale.
2005-10-01T13:50:00.000Z	delire	boboboka	yep, you can grab it all quite easily.
2005-10-01T13:50:00.000Z	delire	boboboka	yes.
2005-10-01T13:51:00.000Z	delire	boboboka	see what concept10 said..
2005-10-01T14:16:00.000Z	delire	boboboka	you've done nothing wrong. sadly i can't help because i don't run gnome here.
2005-10-01T14:17:00.000Z	delire	boboboka	are you sure that System -> Preferences doesn't have a language selector?
2005-10-01T14:18:00.000Z	boboboka	delire	atleast not in english. and not the direct translation from english to my lang.
2005-10-01T14:18:00.000Z	boboboka	delire	can you describe the icon?
2005-10-01T14:19:00.000Z	delire	boboboka	well i don't run gnome.. what is your native language?
2005-10-01T14:20:00.000Z	delire	boboboka	hmm, that's a tough one. i can't attempt a translation.
2005-10-01T14:21:00.000Z	boboboka	delire	what's written in the description of it? (when you move your mouse over it)
2005-10-01T14:21:00.000Z	delire	boboboka	again, you'll need to ask others what it looks like. i don't run anything like gnome.
2005-10-01T14:21:00.000Z	delire	boboboka	is that all the output?
2005-10-01T14:21:00.000Z	boboboka	delire	oh right..
