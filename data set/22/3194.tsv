2008-11-12T23:04:00.000Z	a3Dman		hey guys
2008-11-12T23:04:00.000Z	a3Dman		is there any way to force ubuntu to load with custom res ?
2008-11-12T23:05:00.000Z	a3Dman		I have reslution error
2008-11-12T23:05:00.000Z	a3Dman		out of sync
2008-11-12T23:05:00.000Z	a3Dman		n
2008-11-12T23:06:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist	a3Dman	yes its in xorg.conf
2008-11-12T23:06:00.000Z	a3Dman	Rioting_pacifist	I want to boot with 1024
2008-11-12T23:06:00.000Z	a3Dman		how to edit that ?
2008-11-12T23:07:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist	a3Dman	is your vsync wrong or just your res? if the screen is ok but too small then dpkg-reconfigure xorg-server should let you select avalible resultions, but im sure there will be an easier gnome way of doing it
2008-11-12T23:08:00.000Z	a3Dman		look Rioting_pacifist I boot and see the logon screen enter my name then password then I see sync error in monitor
2008-11-12T23:08:00.000Z	a3Dman		how to force it to load on 1024 Rioting_pacifist
2008-11-12T23:09:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist	a3Dman	It sounds like a gnome problem, which i dont know much about
2008-11-12T23:09:00.000Z	a3Dman		oh thanks
2008-11-12T23:12:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist	a3Dman	you could try moving your gnome directory, that may fix it
2008-11-12T23:12:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist		mv ~/.gnome ~/.gnome~
2008-11-12T23:13:00.000Z	a3Dman		I think it's a monitor HZ problem
2008-11-12T23:13:00.000Z	a3Dman		I'm trying with my other big monitor now Rioting_pacifist
2008-11-12T23:13:00.000Z	a3Dman		I hope this will work
2008-11-12T23:14:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist	a3Dman	whats weird is that the GDM login screen is at the correct hz but gnome itself is not
2008-11-12T23:14:00.000Z	a3Dman		yes
2008-11-12T23:14:00.000Z	a3Dman		logon screen is the right res but after logon I have the sync error Rioting_pacifist
2008-11-12T23:16:00.000Z	a3Dman	Rioting_pacifist	when you change resolution where ubuntu keep this setting or store that ?
