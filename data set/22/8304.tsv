2007-03-17T12:43:00.000Z	tungarbulb		I did as you said. Nothing. No response. Cursor just sits there
2007-03-17T12:43:00.000Z	tungarbulb		No response, no error message, no action of any kind.
2007-03-17T12:44:00.000Z	tungarbulb		That's right, but without the prompt.
2007-03-17T12:45:00.000Z	tungarbulb		Either something went flaky during the upgrade from Dapper to Edgy, or I punched the wrong button someplace.
2007-03-17T12:46:00.000Z	tungarbulb		Damn. So what do I do? Can I repair my installation or is it totally hosed?
2007-03-17T12:46:00.000Z	tungarbulb		What's IDK?
2007-03-17T12:46:00.000Z	tungarbulb		You too huh?
2007-03-17T12:47:00.000Z	tungarbulb		Any idea as to what else I could do in the way of research, repairs, etc.?
2007-03-17T12:48:00.000Z	tungarbulb		Can I re-run the upgrade?
2007-03-17T12:48:00.000Z	tungarbulb		I've been all over Synaptic. No dice. I wish there were some kind of diagnostic tool.
2007-03-17T12:49:00.000Z	Flannel	tungarbulb	What's your sources.list look like?  And, what errors does "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" give?
2007-03-17T12:50:00.000Z	Flannel	tungarbulb	Pastebin /etc/apt/sources.list (open it in a text editor)
2007-03-17T12:53:00.000Z	Flannel	tungarbulb	alright, then open a terminal, and 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
2007-03-17T12:54:00.000Z	Flannel	tungarbulb	I had said to pastebin your sources.list, so I gave you the URL, incase you didn't need it
2007-03-17T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	tungarbulb	alright, so, what's going wrong?
2007-03-17T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	tungarbulb	in a terminal, type "xmms" and see what errors it gives
2007-03-17T12:57:00.000Z	Flannel	tungarbulb	but, a quick way to fix it would be to remove xmms (completely), then reinstall
2007-03-17T12:59:00.000Z	Flannel	tungarbulb	Did you "remove" or "complete removal" in synaptic?
2007-03-17T13:00:00.000Z	Flannel	tungarbulb	Did you remove the package completely? or just "remove" it?
2007-03-17T13:03:00.000Z	Flannel	tungarbulb	I am.  I don't know what to say.  It not running, and not giving an error is most odd.
2007-03-17T13:04:00.000Z	Flannel	tungarbulb	Do you have /home on it's own partition?
2007-03-17T13:06:00.000Z	Flannel	tungarbulb	Ah, then... yeah.  Backup I suppose.  When you reinstall, you might want to put /home on it's own partition, to cut out the "backup" parts later, you can reinstall around all your personal stuff.
