2006-07-10T11:35:00.000Z	bala	bruenig	how to install in console mode like older ubuntu?
2006-07-10T11:35:00.000Z	bruenig	bala	download the server edition and when it boots up and you get logged in and the command prompt, just type 'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop'
2006-07-10T11:37:00.000Z	bala	bruenig	how to find what cd i have? one friend gave me
2006-07-10T11:37:00.000Z	bruenig	bala	do you have high speed internet?
2006-07-10T11:39:00.000Z	bala	bruenig	no ya
2006-07-10T11:39:00.000Z	bruenig	bala	go here and pick server, download it and then burn it to a disk as an image, put it in the disk drive and restart  http://mirror.cs.umn.edu/ubuntu-releases/6.06/
2006-07-10T11:39:00.000Z	bala	bruenig	i have one ubunto 6 cd
2006-07-10T11:39:00.000Z	bala	bruenig	my friend got it from shipit.ubuntu.com
2006-07-10T11:39:00.000Z	bruenig	bala	probably is impractical then to download it as it is 450 MB
2006-07-10T11:40:00.000Z	bala	bruenig	is there any other way to install it from my cd itself?
2006-07-10T11:41:00.000Z	bruenig	bala	that same problem occurred with my machine, it would stall on partition but unless you can download an image yourself, probably out of luck
2006-07-10T11:41:00.000Z	bruenig	bala	the same .iso that was alleged to be on the shipit cd, worked fine
2006-07-10T11:42:00.000Z	bala	bruenig	ya. i have the shipit cd only.
2006-07-10T11:43:00.000Z	bala	bruenig	net connection is very slow. cant download. it will take 2 days
2006-07-10T11:44:00.000Z	bruenig	bala	you could order more cds, which will take a month or so. Or you could download the .iso. Personally I would use bittorrent to download the .iso and just download whenever possible until I get it
2006-07-10T12:08:00.000Z	bala	bruenig	thanks ya. i download it and check.
