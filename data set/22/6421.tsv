2006-11-28T08:57:00.000Z	slinky_		I have lost my system completely because I didn't know how to recover it, can someome please help me
2006-11-28T08:59:00.000Z	Flannel	slinky_	you'll have to give more information.  What's wrong, what you did, etc, etc.  "Broken" doesn't tell us a whole lot
2006-11-28T09:01:00.000Z	slinky_	Flannel	I did a log-out session and then when if asked for id and password, it accepted them and then presented a black screen and an houtglass then went back to log-in screen
2006-11-28T09:01:00.000Z	Flannel	slinky_	you're using gnome?
2006-11-28T09:02:00.000Z	slinky_	Flannel	I had both KDE and Gnome installed
2006-11-28T09:02:00.000Z	Flannel	slinky_	and they both don't work?  (We'll fix gnome, I'm not sure about the exact file for KDE)
2006-11-28T09:03:00.000Z	slinky_	Flannel	neither logon would work, the only thing i could get up was the console and I didn't know enough to recover using the console, what i would like to know is what can I do next thime so I don't have to rebuild again
2006-11-28T09:04:00.000Z	slinky_	Flannel	I had to rebuilt using Dapper Drake, lost everything, I could not get internet access to ask for help
2006-11-28T09:04:00.000Z	Flannel	slinky_	sure.  Actually, try this.  At the login screen (GDM or KDM, depending on your setup), choose the "rescue mode" or "safe mode" or whatever, under "session", and login.  See if that works
2006-11-28T09:06:00.000Z	slinky_	Flannel	I no longer have that system, it's all gone, I am running Dapper Drake now, starting from scratch, what I don't know is what SHOULD i have done
2006-11-28T09:07:00.000Z	Flannel	slinky_	oh.  Well, that depends a lot about what's wrong.  Which couldve been a few things.  I imagine it was gnome/kde startup files.  Safe/whatever mode wouldve bypassed those.  Or you wouldve had to delete/disable them from the command line.  But, again.  It all depends.  Next time it happens, log on to here (via irssi on the command line if nothing else) and I'm sure someone will be able to diagnose/fix it.
2006-11-28T09:09:00.000Z	Flannel	slinky_	just remember that command ;)  Or, "irc" is symlinked to irssi (by default), and should launch another client if you've configured it that way.  So, just come here and ask.  Unfortunately, there is no definitive answer, like most things.
2006-11-28T09:10:00.000Z	slinky_	Flannel	I understand, been doing this since 1964 but am new to Linux and kind of lost :), thank you very much for your help
2006-11-28T09:11:00.000Z	slinky_	Flannel	One quick question please when you see 0ubuntu4, what does the 0 and the 4 represent?
2006-11-28T09:12:00.000Z	Flannel	slinky_	versions?  Can you psate the whole version number?
2006-11-28T09:13:00.000Z	slinky_	Flannel	when in Synaptic, it shows after the filename, I was wondering what the leading and trailing digits represent
2006-11-28T09:15:00.000Z	Flannel	slinky_	well, thats... which file?  thats a partial version number.  do you have a version column shrunk down or something?
2006-11-28T09:16:00.000Z	slinky_	Flannel	do you have a URL explaining the format by change, i'll have to check on screenlayout when i open it
2006-11-28T09:18:00.000Z	Flannel	slinky_	sure, like this: http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/gnome/abiword-gnome the version is (2.4.5-0ubuntu2)  which means when we added it to the repos, we got 2.4.5-0 (probably from debian) then if there's a "ubuntu#" that means that it's the # revision (in this case 2) specific to ubuntu.
2006-11-28T09:19:00.000Z	slinky_	Flannel	3:3.3.6 -1ubuntu6.1 Qt3 Developer ......, what is the first -1 represent?
2006-11-28T09:20:00.000Z	Flannel	slinky_	when we got it, it's probably debian got it as 3.3.6 then changed it to -1, then we go tit, then changed it a few times. to 6.1 (whatever that means, whether 6 major and 1 minior revision, or whatever)
2006-11-28T09:21:00.000Z	slinky_	Flannel	ok, that makes sense, thank you for all your help, and have a great day
