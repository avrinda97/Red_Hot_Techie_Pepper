2005-04-22T06:36:00.000Z	Xgates		anyone compiled their kernel, for the life of me I have all the correct settings for my hardware but this thing keeps doing a panic on install, I need someone to look at this .config I did and see if anyone can see the problem
2005-04-22T06:37:00.000Z	Xgates		lol
2005-04-22T06:39:00.000Z	Xgates		all I can think is that Ubuntu is setup that is needs [ ]  Power Management support  compiled in
2005-04-22T06:40:00.000Z	Xgates		that is./it ....
2005-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	Xgates		YEs of course and SO I can learn how this distro is working
2005-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	Xgates		I'm a hands on guy
2005-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	Xgates		hehe
2005-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	Xgates		but this is getting WAY out of hand here
2005-04-22T06:42:00.000Z	Xgates		no one in here has compiled their kernel?
2005-04-22T06:42:00.000Z	Reblended	Xgates	with updating, you keep your settings, yes?
2005-04-22T06:42:00.000Z	Xgates	Reblended	huh?
2005-04-22T06:42:00.000Z	Reblended	Xgates	when everyone updates ubuntu, the settings are saved?
2005-04-22T06:43:00.000Z	Xgates		I Just need someone to look at this .config to tell me if they see what it is Ubuntu needs, because as far as hardware goes on this box its correct
2005-04-22T06:43:00.000Z	Reblended	Xgates	like, I don't have to re-do tweaks, etc
2005-04-22T06:43:00.000Z	Reblended	Xgates	or do I have to patch all over again?
2005-04-22T06:43:00.000Z	Xgates	Reblended	hard to say depending on what type of kernel support they build into the distro next
2005-04-22T06:44:00.000Z	Reblended	Xgates	ic, yow
2005-04-22T06:44:00.000Z	Xgates	Reblended	typically you shouldnt have to mess with it on a update
2005-04-22T06:44:00.000Z	Reblended	Xgates	like, I wouldn't have to reset my themes, etc
2005-04-22T06:44:00.000Z	Xgates	Reblended	no themes have nothing to do with kernel support
2005-04-22T06:44:00.000Z	Reblended	Xgates	ok
2005-04-22T06:45:00.000Z	Xgates	Reblended	the kernel is more for hardware types of support
