2008-08-31T06:08:00.000Z	scifiguy951	outbriber	i want to log onto a laptop from this comp
2008-08-31T06:08:00.000Z	scifiguy951	outbriber	via router
2008-08-31T06:08:00.000Z	outbriber	scifiguy951	To log onto another computer, you need ssh.
2008-08-31T06:09:00.000Z	scifiguy951	outbriber	synaptic?
2008-08-31T06:09:00.000Z	outbriber	scifiguy951	ssh is installed by default on ubuntu machines. You run it from the command line like this: ssh user@ipaddress
2008-08-31T06:10:00.000Z	scifiguy951	outbriber	how do i get the ip and usernames?
2008-08-31T06:11:00.000Z	outbriber	scifiguy951	To get the ip, one way is to point your web browser to whatismyip.com. The username is just whatever you have set on there. Is the other computer running ubuntu/linux?
2008-08-31T06:12:00.000Z	scifiguy951	outbriber	no, i think its winXP
2008-08-31T06:14:00.000Z	outbriber	scifiguy951	You can log onto that using VNC. It will require a bit more setup. vncviwer should be on your ubuntu machine, you'll need to install UltraVNC or the like on the XP machine and set up a password. With VNC you actually see what is on the other computer's screen, but it is quite a bit slower than ssh.
