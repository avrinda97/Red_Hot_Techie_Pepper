2005-09-26T05:00:00.000Z	typo	dooglus	looks like it can't find the system libraries
2005-09-26T05:02:00.000Z	dooglus	typo	md5sum /usr/lib/mono/gac/glib-sharp/1.0.0.0__35e10195dab3c99f/glib-sharp.dll ?

2005-09-26T05:02:00.000Z	dooglus		13c3bd2b853a8f6245492a0ba0e867c9  /usr/lib/mono/gac/glib-sharp/1.0.0.0__35e10195dab3c99f/glib-sharp.dll here too
2005-09-26T05:02:00.000Z	typo	dooglus	yep, looks the same
2005-09-26T05:04:00.000Z	dooglus	typo	I don't know enough about mono to help.  Do you know how to find out where it looks for things?
2005-09-26T05:04:00.000Z	typo	dooglus	looks like it can't find the System assembly
2005-09-26T05:04:00.000Z	typo	dooglus	not really
2005-09-26T05:05:00.000Z	dooglus	typo	I'll try 'strace' to see what files it opens.  You should too.
2005-09-26T05:07:00.000Z	typo	dooglus	solved it
2005-09-26T05:07:00.000Z	dooglus	typo	oh, good.  how?
2005-09-26T05:07:00.000Z	typo	dooglus	I ran "apt-get install --reinstall mono-classlib-1.0"
2005-09-26T05:07:00.000Z	typo	dooglus	for some reason /usr/lib/mono/1.0/System.dll didn't exist although that package should contain it
