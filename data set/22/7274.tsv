2006-10-23T08:45:00.000Z	sparkleytone		i just did a dist-upgrade from breezy to dapper
2006-10-23T08:45:00.000Z	sparkleytone		and now i can't ssh to the box
2006-10-23T08:45:00.000Z	sparkleytone		it just closes the connection as soon as i make it
2006-10-23T08:45:00.000Z	sparkleytone		has anyone seen this problem?
2006-10-23T08:45:00.000Z	sparkleytone		its not logging any errors
2006-10-23T08:45:00.000Z	sobersabre	sparkleytone	maybe the signature of the server has changed
2006-10-23T08:45:00.000Z	sobersabre	sparkleytone	what do you mean "cannot connect"
2006-10-23T08:45:00.000Z	sobersabre	sparkleytone	then, you need to increase logging verbosity on the server and read its logs
2006-10-23T08:45:00.000Z	sobersabre	sparkleytone	and where are you looking for problems ?
2006-10-23T08:45:00.000Z	sobersabre	sparkleytone	sorry, look in /var/log, debug, auth, daemon etc.
2006-10-23T08:46:00.000Z	sparkleytone	sobersabre	nothing
2006-10-23T08:47:00.000Z	sobersabre	sparkleytone	are you sure you've restarted sshd on the server, and have enabled the logging ?
2006-10-23T08:47:00.000Z	sparkleytone	sobersabre	yup
2006-10-23T08:49:00.000Z	sobersabre	sparkleytone	have you done any network related hardware/software changes ? ( iptables rule... )
2006-10-23T08:50:00.000Z	sobersabre	sparkleytone	have you upgraded the kernel, rebooted etc. ?
2006-10-23T08:53:00.000Z	sobersabre	sparkleytone	after upgradeing things like glibc, modutils, etc. it is not so bad to reboot.
2006-10-23T08:58:00.000Z	sparkleytone	sobersabre	http://paste.lisp.org/display/28549
2006-10-23T09:01:00.000Z	sobersabre	sparkleytone	do you have "Protocol 1,2" in /etc/ssh/sshd_config ?
2006-10-23T09:01:00.000Z	sparkleytone	sobersabre	http://paste.lisp.org/display/28549#1
2006-10-23T09:01:00.000Z	sparkleytone	sobersabre	have Protocol 2
2006-10-23T09:02:00.000Z	sobersabre	sparkleytone	and in the client - in /etc/ssh/ssh_config
2006-10-23T09:03:00.000Z	sparkleytone	sobersabre	it all worked fine.  then upgraded server.  now it doesn't work.
