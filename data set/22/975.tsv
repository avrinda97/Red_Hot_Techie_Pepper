2011-02-01T11:17:00.000Z	jayd3e		anyone know how to download samba3 through apt-get instead of samba4?  b/c every time I do a sudo apt-get install samba, it installs 4
2011-02-01T11:18:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	jayd3e	sudo apt-cache search samba | grep -i samba3
2011-02-01T11:18:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	jayd3e	see if it's there, i think i heard it isn't
2011-02-01T11:19:00.000Z	jayd3e	Us3r_Unfriendly	ill check, why wouldn't it be?  The devs say on the wiki that samba4 shouldn't be used on a production server yet.  So I'm trying to use 3 and I can't? lol
2011-02-01T11:20:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	jayd3e	i have no idea, that's what i heard someone talking about here.  they could be wrong
2011-02-01T11:21:00.000Z	jayd3e	Us3r_Unfriendly	yah it isn't there
2011-02-01T11:21:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	jayd3e	yeah i don't see it either
