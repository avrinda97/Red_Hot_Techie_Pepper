2006-07-21T10:31:00.000Z	Ballsy		Anyone have good luck with SIS 760 vid chipsets when running Dapper LiveCD?  It freezes a while, then dumps me to a blank screen after 'configuring some drivers...ok' with blinking cursor.
2006-07-21T10:29:00.000Z	Ballsy		Hi Gang.  Could someone tell me how to boot into 'text mode' when using the LiveCD ?  I'm having video issues and need to get things going without X first.....
2006-07-21T10:29:00.000Z	aty	Ballsy	same problem. same question
2006-07-21T10:29:00.000Z	aty		:D
2006-07-21T10:30:00.000Z	Ballsy	aty	yes, I thought someone might remember me <g>
2006-07-21T10:30:00.000Z	aty	Ballsy	"Failed to start x server"?
2006-07-21T10:30:00.000Z	aty		no i dont remember you. i have the same problem with an nvidia gf2 card
2006-07-21T10:30:00.000Z	Ballsy	aty	I get as far as    'configuring some drivers...ok' which then dumps me to a blank screen with blinking cursor.
2006-07-21T10:31:00.000Z	aty		yeah and after the blinking cursor?
2006-07-21T10:31:00.000Z	Ballsy	aty	ah, understood.  SiS 760 on-board here....
2006-07-21T10:31:00.000Z	Ballsy	aty	after?  Nothing.  Sits there....indefinitely....
2006-07-21T10:31:00.000Z	aty		hmm.. i have got an error message too.. then sits there
2006-07-21T10:31:00.000Z	aty		:D
2006-07-21T10:32:00.000Z	aty		do you know how to reach the live-expert ?
2006-07-21T10:32:00.000Z	aty		because i have found everywhere this solution
2006-07-21T10:32:00.000Z	Ballsy	aty	I tried the amd64.iso as well (AMD Athlon 64 arch here) and it dies too, but with some error16 notes about segfaults.
2006-07-21T10:32:00.000Z	aty		but if i put it in the boot prompt it wont work
2006-07-21T10:32:00.000Z	aty		i have tried the desktop i386 iso
2006-07-21T10:32:00.000Z	aty		i have 32 bit system
2006-07-21T10:33:00.000Z	aty		but i cannot understand what the hell can be the problem...
2006-07-21T10:33:00.000Z	aty		anyone?:)
2006-07-21T10:33:00.000Z	Ballsy	aty	have you tried specifying just the number '3' as your boot option ?  That may (or may not?) take you to run level 3, without X.  It'll want you to log in though...not sure what the def user/pass would be....trying that now myself
