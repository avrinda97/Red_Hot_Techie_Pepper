2006-11-17T12:07:00.000Z	haxality		hey, I would like to remove esd from my 6.06 installation
2006-11-17T12:08:00.000Z	haxality		it says that I need to remove ubuntu-desktop, but I remember before I had no problems getting rid of it
2006-11-17T12:08:00.000Z	haxality		thank you
2006-11-17T12:08:00.000Z	haxality		ah, ok
2006-11-17T12:08:00.000Z	haxality		what is ubuntu-desktop, anyways?
2006-11-17T12:08:00.000Z	haxality		it sounded important
2006-11-17T12:09:00.000Z	Flannel	haxality	it's a meta package, depending on everything you need to have the full, complete "ubuntu" system
2006-11-17T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	haxality	no.  You'll lose nothing.
2006-11-17T12:17:00.000Z	Flannel	haxality	you must be removing something else then, not just ubuntu-desktop
2007-01-15T16:34:00.000Z	Flannel	haxality	sudo apt-get update
2007-01-15T16:34:00.000Z	haxality	Flannel	I still can't install packages
2007-01-15T16:34:00.000Z	Flannel	haxality	what error do you get?
2007-01-15T16:49:00.000Z	Flannel	haxality	that's ok.  You can back everything up, and reinstalls aren't that painful with proper backups
2007-01-15T16:50:00.000Z	Flannel	haxality	yeah, you might even be able to get a dpkg -l to work, so you even know what packages you have
2007-01-15T16:50:00.000Z	Flannel	haxality	dpkg -l
2007-01-15T16:50:00.000Z	Flannel	haxality	assuming it doesn't error ;)
2007-01-15T16:52:00.000Z	Flannel	haxality	/var/cache/dpkg/status should have indications of what you have installed
2007-01-15T16:53:00.000Z	Flannel	haxality	haha.  well, that explains why dpkg is borked ;)
2007-01-15T16:55:00.000Z	Flannel	haxality	were you playing around in a root terminal perhaps?
2007-01-15T16:56:00.000Z	haxality	Flannel	no.. all I've done root-wise in the last few hours is install that one piece of software, and do a whole bunch of apt-ing
2007-01-15T16:57:00.000Z	Flannel	haxality	remember to back up your /etc ;)  all that configuration stuff is what kills reinstalls.  Well, if you have apache configred and stuff
2007-01-15T16:58:00.000Z	Flannel	haxality	linux assumes you know what youre doing.  Whether that's for good, or for evil.
