2006-05-03T08:33:00.000Z	mram	muraii_	have you tried xfce?
2006-05-03T08:35:00.000Z	muraii_	mram	No.  I was thinking of toying with Zenwalk 2 distro, which comes outta the box with xfce.
2006-05-03T08:36:00.000Z	mram	muraii_	yah i know a guy who uses zenwalk but he converted over to ubuntu when told him how great it is ;-)
2006-05-03T08:37:00.000Z	muraii_	mram	The file manager is the tricky thing.  I've got Nautilus in my right-click menu, but it wants to throw an icon on my desktop for a network drive I have (the Mac).  Plus, I have to switch to a different desktop to get to my Openbox 3 right-click menu.  I need to find a file manager that doesn't hijack my menu.xml settings.
2006-05-03T08:38:00.000Z	mram	muraii_	hmm yeah i have my ssh drive and my network drive on the desktop also, and want to get right of
2006-05-03T08:38:00.000Z	muraii_	mram	Yeah, Zenwalk, being a Slackware derivative, sounds a bit more intermediate/advanced than I have the time to try out.
2006-05-03T08:38:00.000Z	muraii_	mram	I want no icons at all.  I never use 'em, so they're just clutter.
2006-05-03T08:39:00.000Z	mram	muraii_	i hear you on the no icons thing
2006-05-03T09:03:00.000Z	mram	muraii_	gnucash is it really that good?
2006-05-03T09:03:00.000Z	muraii_	mram	It looks nice.  That's as far as I've gone with it.
2006-05-03T09:03:00.000Z	mram	muraii_	:-) looking nice never hurt no one.
2006-05-03T09:04:00.000Z	muraii_	mram	True.
2006-05-03T09:04:00.000Z	muraii_	mram	Kind of.
2006-05-03T09:04:00.000Z	mram	muraii_	getting it right now to check it out
2006-05-03T09:05:00.000Z	muraii_	mram	Did you see the dependencies?
2006-05-03T09:06:00.000Z	mram	muraii_	synaptic got all i needed
2006-05-03T09:06:00.000Z	muraii_	mram	Yeah, it's painless.  I guess I'm still so used to Windows that when I see 20-30 other utilities and libraries going in my system, I'm something less than at ease.
2006-05-03T09:07:00.000Z	mram	muraii_	haha, i am trying to move away from windows!
2006-05-03T09:07:00.000Z	muraii_	mram	Me too.
2006-05-03T09:08:00.000Z	mram	muraii_	although xp pro is good, it's just microsoft makes it so hard to customize you system to make it your own, and with vista they are being more and more anal
2006-05-03T09:09:00.000Z	mram	muraii_	ttyl
2006-05-03T09:09:00.000Z	muraii_	mram	Yeah.  XP hogs the system I have it on (my work computer, so I don't own it).  I tried--what is it--NextLite or something, a way to replace iexplorer.exe as Windows shell.  That lets you customize similarly to Linux; but it seemed even MORE cumbersome.
