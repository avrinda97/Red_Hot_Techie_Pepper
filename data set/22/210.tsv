2012-05-11T16:11:00.000Z	bibi23		did someone already updated php from 5.3.2 to 5.4.3 on ubuntu? is it simple? and do we have to reinstall all the extensions as well (apc, memcache, ...) ?
2012-05-11T16:12:00.000Z	ikonia	bibi23	I'm not aware of a 5.4.3 update
2012-05-11T16:13:00.000Z	bibi23	ikonia	it was released a few days ago
2012-05-11T16:13:00.000Z	ikonia	bibi23	released where ?
2012-05-11T16:13:00.000Z	bibi23	ikonia	i don't know I just saw on php.net
2012-05-11T16:14:00.000Z	ikonia	bibi23	right, so that isn't an ubuntu pacakge, there is no ubuntu apckage
2012-05-11T16:14:00.000Z	ikonia	bibi23	use what ubuntu offers you and don't worry about it
2012-05-11T16:16:00.000Z	ikonia	bibi23	then use 5.3.2
2012-05-11T16:16:00.000Z	bibi23	ikonia	but it's very old, I can't believe there is no way to upgrade to a new version, even if it's not 5.4
2012-05-11T16:16:00.000Z	ikonia	bibi23	why do you want to upgrade ?
2012-05-11T16:17:00.000Z	ikonia	bibi23	what do you want that's not in the version you have ?
2012-05-11T16:17:00.000Z	bibi23	ikonia	no particular reason just to be up to date
2012-05-11T16:17:00.000Z	ikonia	bibi23	then don't
2012-05-11T16:17:00.000Z	ikonia	bibi23	the ubuntu guys are offering you the package that is best suited for the version of the OS and components you are running - use what they offer you
2012-06-19T14:15:00.000Z	ikonia	bibi23	apt-get install package, if it's installed it will say "package already installed"
2012-06-19T14:16:00.000Z	bibi23	ikonia	but I don't want to install it, just check if it's here
2012-06-19T14:16:00.000Z	ikonia	bibi23	dpkg -l | grep package
2012-06-19T14:18:00.000Z	bibi23	ikonia	ok it looks good thanks, but I don't understand why? it says dpkg is for debian packages, and I've never used it, how can it know wich packages are installed? apt-get and dpkg are the same?
2012-06-19T14:19:00.000Z	ikonia	bibi23	dpkg is the package manager for the "deb" package format used for both ubuntu and debian
2012-06-19T14:19:00.000Z	ikonia	bibi23	apt-get is an interface or "hook" into dpkg
2012-06-19T14:21:00.000Z	bibi23	ikonia	ok, but what shorcuts apt-get brings to us? the short name packages instead of the whole deb url?
2012-06-19T14:22:00.000Z	ikonia	bibi23	it doesn't give shortcuts
