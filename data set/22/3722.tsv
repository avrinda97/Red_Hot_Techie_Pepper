2008-06-15T17:46:00.000Z	Guest77423		sometimes when i try to run a program that belongs in my home directory (usually a hidden directory), i get a response " ... " is not owned by you
2008-06-15T17:47:00.000Z	Guest77423		how can i fix this?
2008-06-15T17:47:00.000Z	LimCore	Guest77423	paste the exact command
2008-06-15T17:47:00.000Z	Guest77423	LimCore	the exact command?
2008-06-15T17:48:00.000Z	LimCore	Guest77423	paste exactly what you do and what happens to demonstrate the problem
2008-06-15T17:51:00.000Z	Guest77423	LimCore	http://paste.ubuntu.com/20339/
2008-06-15T17:52:00.000Z	LimCore	Guest77423	what is the result of command:     ls -l  /home/jacob/ | grep .wine     if its 1 or 2 lines then paste here
2008-06-15T17:53:00.000Z	LimCore	Guest77423	best, execute:   sudo chown jacob.jacob  /home/jacob/.wine
2008-06-15T17:54:00.000Z	LimCore	Guest77423	this should fix this problem
2008-06-15T17:54:00.000Z	LimCore	Guest77423	that wine directory was not owned by you; probably you previously executed wine as root and this caused this problem.  command above should fix it
2008-06-15T17:55:00.000Z	LimCore	Guest77423	do the chown which I written and try again to run your program

2008-06-15T17:57:00.000Z	LimCore	Guest77423	why you do  sudo wine ... ?    try without the sudo.   just    wine Autorun.inf
2008-06-15T18:20:00.000Z	LimCore	Guest77423	what happens if you simply try the  wine ./Autorun.inf   without the "sudo" ?    (btw, for harder questions, try asking on ubuntu forums)
2008-06-15T18:22:00.000Z	LimCore	Guest77423	the problem is that you do not run Autorun.inf like that.
2008-06-15T18:22:00.000Z	LimCore	Guest77423	do:   cat Autorun.inf    and see the name of .exe  to be executed,  then run this exe by hand, like:   wine setup.exe   or  wine someprogram.exe  or whatever it is
2008-06-15T18:23:00.000Z	LimCore	Guest77423	ask #winehq about how to run Autorun.inf   or just run the .exe
2008-06-15T18:24:00.000Z	LimCore	Guest77423	you are running IRC client as root.  don't do that
2008-06-15T18:24:00.000Z	LimCore	Guest77423	run IRC client as normal user, not as root.
2008-06-15T18:25:00.000Z	Guest77423	LimCore	want me to re-run?
2008-06-15T18:25:00.000Z	LimCore	Guest77423	you are doing something wrong.....   reboot  computer,  open a termianl like  gnome-terminal or aterm   run:  id  (it should show that yu are john or something, NOT root) and then run in it  konversation  or xchat  or whatever client you are using
2008-06-15T18:27:00.000Z	Guest77423	LimCore	ok, i'll tell you the results
