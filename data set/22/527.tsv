2011-09-06T02:21:00.000Z	ubuntu2		I'm having some trouble with grub
2011-09-06T02:22:00.000Z	ubuntu2		was wondering if anyone here could help or point me somewhere that could
2011-09-06T02:23:00.000Z	urlin2u	ubuntu2	boot proble?
2011-09-06T02:27:00.000Z	urlin2u	ubuntu2	at all what do you see?
2011-09-06T02:28:00.000Z	urlin2u	ubuntu2	sorry look above
2011-09-06T02:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	ubuntu2	plug the thumb in and see if you get a grub menu, you probabaly put grub on the thumb.
2011-09-06T02:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	ubuntu2	use the channel no pm;s
2011-09-06T02:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	ubuntu2	run this script and pastebin the RESULTS.txt. http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/
2011-09-06T02:32:00.000Z	urlin2u	ubuntu2	if you have two HD's the grub bootloader may be in the other one, you can move it above the other in the bios.
2011-09-06T02:41:00.000Z	ubuntu2	urlin2u	I use 'sudo bash ~Desktop/boot_info_script.sh' and it tells me no such directory
2011-09-06T02:43:00.000Z	urlin2u	ubuntu2	you need the script unpacked and on the desktop.
2011-09-06T02:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	ubuntu2	put it on the desktop and copy and paste the command
2011-09-06T02:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	ubuntu2	cool,  http://paste.ubuntu.com/
2011-09-06T02:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	ubuntu2	put grub2 in the sdb mbr you also have two swaps. Put the sdb first in the bios if not already, or is not a slave. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling_GRUB2
2011-09-06T02:54:00.000Z	ubuntu2	urlin2u	only one HD shows up in my bios - the other is a old IDE slave that only has music on it.
2011-09-06T02:55:00.000Z	urlin2u	ubuntu2	since windows is booting I would just use easybsd, you have a cracked set up to be honest.
2011-09-06T02:56:00.000Z	ubuntu2	urlin2u	I don't understand how it got like that.. the only thing that should be on there is win7 and 30gb partition for ubuntu
2011-09-06T02:57:00.000Z	urlin2u	ubuntu2	2 W7 is one is a bootpartition, one is C
2011-09-06T02:57:00.000Z	urlin2u	ubuntu2	er XP
2011-09-06T02:58:00.000Z	urlin2u	ubuntu2	either vista or W7 looks like Vista
2011-09-06T03:13:00.000Z	ubuntu2	urlin2u	okay I ran boot repair - will see if that works brb
