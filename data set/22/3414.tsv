2011-11-25T04:41:00.000Z	happyface	bekks	or put that in .profile!
2011-11-25T04:41:00.000Z	bekks	happyface	Well, that would be the way for doing that with a dedicated irc user account on the server, yes.
2011-11-25T04:42:00.000Z	bekks	happyface	But thats a good point, I have to separate my user accounts a bit more :P
2011-11-25T04:45:00.000Z	bekks	happyface	Well, ubuntu doesnt at all using a windows based software raid :)
2011-11-25T04:45:00.000Z	happyface	bekks	it does in the live cd
2011-11-25T04:45:00.000Z	bekks	happyface	I know that it doesnt - it cant, technically :)
2011-11-25T04:46:00.000Z	happyface	bekks	well I can see my RAID parition with the live CD. Maybe the intel controller is really really good?
2011-11-25T04:47:00.000Z	bekks	happyface	well, lets start over. Which controller do you use exactly? did you setup the software raid using windows or ubuntu?
2011-11-25T04:49:00.000Z	happyface	bekks	well it's using intel rapid storage technology. I meant to asy "firmware RAID" rather than hardware/software RAID
2011-11-25T04:50:00.000Z	bekks	happyface	thats a clearly windows based technology.
2011-11-25T04:51:00.000Z	happyface	bekks	from wikipedia: "Linux supports Matrix RAID through device mapper (DM-RAID) and MD-RAID"
2011-11-25T04:51:00.000Z	bekks	happyface	matrix raid is another thing than rapid storage by intel ;)
2011-11-25T04:52:00.000Z	happyface	bekks	I probbaly don't know much about RAID, but that was from here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Rapid_Storage_Technology
2011-11-25T04:52:00.000Z	bekks	happyface	So which controller do you use exactly?
2011-11-25T04:53:00.000Z	bekks	happyface	first sentence in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Rapid_Storage_Technology
2011-11-25T04:54:00.000Z	happyface	bekks	intel P67 chipset
2011-11-25T04:54:00.000Z	bekks	happyface	Thats not hardware raid at all :)
2011-11-25T04:54:00.000Z	happyface	bekks	I know, I thought it was software
2011-11-25T04:55:00.000Z	happyface	bekks	but wikipedia says it's "firmware"
2011-11-25T04:55:00.000Z	bekks	happyface	Yes it basically is. There a firmware part which is used by some windows userland application.
2011-11-25T04:56:00.000Z	happyface	bekks	so how does linux see the partition? Because it definitely does
2011-11-25T04:56:00.000Z	bekks	happyface	Well, then startup your live cd and nopaste the output of "fdisk -l".
