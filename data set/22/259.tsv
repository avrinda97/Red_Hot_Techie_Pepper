2012-04-12T23:22:00.000Z	Kanerix		hi
2012-04-12T23:24:00.000Z	kame	Kanerix	mount: /media/sda1 not mounted already
2012-04-12T23:25:00.000Z	Kanerix	kame	um is that the actual mount point?
2012-04-12T23:26:00.000Z	kame	Kanerix	but I cant find sda1,2 or 3
2012-04-12T23:26:00.000Z	kame	Kanerix	wait :)
2012-04-12T23:28:00.000Z	kame	Kanerix	  /dev/sda1 on /media/sda1 type ext2 ....         but mount -o remount,rw /dev/sda1 doesn't work
2012-04-12T23:29:00.000Z	kame	Kanerix	no
2012-04-12T23:29:00.000Z	kame	Kanerix	only readable filesystem also with sudo
2012-04-12T23:30:00.000Z	kame	Kanerix	I want to reinstall Linux now
2012-04-12T23:31:00.000Z	kame	Kanerix	because it got broken :/   I used gentoo and cross-development but I dont know how to make my folder writeable :D
2012-04-12T23:32:00.000Z	kame	Kanerix	you mean chmod?
2012-04-12T23:33:00.000Z	Kanerix	kame	yep
2012-04-12T23:45:00.000Z	kame	Kanerix	Any ideas?
2012-04-12T23:45:00.000Z	Kanerix	kame	um did you check the permissions?
2012-04-12T23:45:00.000Z	Kanerix	kame	You might try unmounting the file system and running a fsck on it
2012-04-12T23:46:00.000Z	kame	Kanerix	731 for /mnt
2012-04-12T23:46:00.000Z	Kanerix	kame	you said it was mounted at /media/sda1
2012-04-12T23:48:00.000Z	kame	Kanerix	yes
2012-04-12T23:49:00.000Z	Kanerix	kame	so what does permissions of /mnt/ have to do with the permissions of /media/sda1/whatever
2012-04-12T23:52:00.000Z	kame	Kanerix	same permissions in mnt and media
2012-04-12T23:56:00.000Z	Kanerix	kame	how many times is /dev/sda1 mounted on your machine?
