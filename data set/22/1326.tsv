2010-06-26T03:59:00.000Z	Ricky123		hey
2010-06-26T03:59:00.000Z	Ricky123		is there any way for me to completely remoev all users from my linux?
2010-06-26T04:00:00.000Z	Ricky123		i mean, remove all of the passwords so they cannot login
2010-06-26T04:00:00.000Z	Ricky123		only with a ppk file or whateva
2010-06-26T04:00:00.000Z	peturi	Ricky123	would you like to delete the home directories as well?
2010-06-26T04:01:00.000Z	Ricky123	peturi	lol no
2010-06-26T04:01:00.000Z	peturi	Ricky123	so remove all users but keep their files?
2010-06-26T04:01:00.000Z	Ricky123	peturi	i just want to create a user and then set it back to the way it is now whereby nobody can login unless they got the private key
2010-06-26T04:03:00.000Z	peturi	Ricky123	I have never thougt of logging into the system using a keyfile, sorry.
2010-06-26T04:04:00.000Z	Ricky123	peturi	ya, they use is especially when accessing a server instance in cloud computing environments
2010-06-26T04:05:00.000Z	peturi	Ricky123	passwordless rsa authendication using a keyfile, ye?
2010-06-26T04:07:00.000Z	Ricky123	peturi	, yes that is what i'm using right now. But i'd like to temporarily create an admin password and then when I get home put it back to the way it is now
2010-06-26T04:07:00.000Z	Ricky123	peturi	do you know how i can do it?
2010-06-26T04:09:00.000Z	Ricky123	peturi	, will passwd --delete username work?
2010-06-26T04:10:00.000Z	peturi	Ricky123	You want to create a NEW user account with the same access to the system as the 'root' ?
2010-06-26T04:12:00.000Z	Ricky123	peturi	well, maybe i could just set a root password and use that acct and then somehow remove the pasword. passwd --delete root   should work to remove right?
2010-06-26T04:12:00.000Z	peturi	Ricky123	password --delete user, will do the trick.
2010-06-26T04:13:00.000Z	peturi	Ricky123	Maby it's not a good idea to play with the root account, better to create a new account and edit the /etc/passwd file and give the new user the UID 0, or better: add him to the /etc/sudoers file so he can use sudo to perform root operations
2010-06-26T04:15:00.000Z	Ricky123	peturi	i want to play with the root
2010-06-26T04:17:00.000Z	peturi	Ricky123	Then set the hroot password using passwd, play with it and remember to disable it again using the --delete option. Also make sure that you have "PermitRootLogin yes" in your /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2010-06-26T04:20:00.000Z	Ricky123	peturi	wait, instead I will put a password on the ubuntu user instead as it has sudo access
2010-06-26T04:20:00.000Z	peturi	Ricky123	Much better, you'll need to edit /etc/sudoers
