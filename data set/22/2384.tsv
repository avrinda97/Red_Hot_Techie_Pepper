2010-09-20T20:13:00.000Z	pp__		hi people, i'm trying to install a driver for my 5650 HD card on a 64bit 10.10 maverick system.. everything i'v tried so far has given nothing but errors
2010-09-20T20:14:00.000Z	pp__		okay
2010-09-20T20:15:00.000Z	BluesKaj	pp__	better to ask in #ubuntu+1 , it's the maverick chat
2010-09-21T19:43:00.000Z	BluesKaj	pp__	no audio ?
2010-09-21T19:45:00.000Z	pp__	BluesKaj	: no audio AND no video
2010-09-21T19:46:00.000Z	BluesKaj	pp__	which graphics card and what are you connecting the hdmi to ?
2010-09-21T19:47:00.000Z	pp__	BluesKaj	: Radeon Mobility HD 5650. laptop is vaio, tv is bravia
2010-09-21T19:48:00.000Z	BluesKaj	pp__	I have to ask, is the tv set to the proper input ?
2010-09-21T19:51:00.000Z	pp__	BluesKaj	: yes, i'm 100 procent sure. I just tried HDMI port 1 and 3 and input 1 and 3, and all i get is a black screen. when i try to set it up in system>pref>monitor it thinks my tv is 72" (it's 32) and when i apply the settings(enable tv screen) i get an xorg error, t doesn't support the resolution size - no matter which resoultion i pick
2010-09-21T19:53:00.000Z	pp__	BluesKaj	and i can't configure through the gfx driver, because i don't have one (ati+ubuntu= -.-)
2010-09-21T19:56:00.000Z	BluesKaj	pp__	do you have the ati control center installed ?
2010-09-21T19:57:00.000Z	pp__	BluesKaj	: i can't install fglrx
2010-09-21T19:57:00.000Z	BluesKaj	pp__	ok which driver do you have ?
2010-09-21T20:00:00.000Z	pp__	BluesKaj	i dont even know. i'm guessing the one that comes with ubuntu 10.04. as far as im concerned it's impossible to install any ati driver for my gfx card on ubuntu(i've been trying for the past 72 hours)
2010-09-21T20:05:00.000Z	BluesKaj	pp__	according to this page there is new fglrx prerelease driver available that works , check it out ,https://bugs.launchpad.net/archlinux/+source/fglrx-installer/+bug/544638
2010-09-21T20:06:00.000Z	pp__	BluesKaj	: thanks, i'll try it, can i get back to you if it fails?
2010-09-21T20:06:00.000Z	BluesKaj	pp__	yes , but I dunno how I can help :(
2010-09-21T20:10:00.000Z	pp__	BluesKaj	can you give me a step-by-step instruction on how to install that driver (including the steps on the homepage), i'm frankly quite confused :S
2010-09-21T20:11:00.000Z	BluesKaj	pp__	homepage ?
2010-09-21T20:12:00.000Z	pp__	BluesKaj	you gave me a link https://bugs.launchpad.net/archlinux/+source/fglrx-installer/+bug/544638
2010-09-21T20:13:00.000Z	pp__	BluesKaj	every link i press that looks like a download just leads me to another redirect to something unrelated
2010-09-21T20:17:00.000Z	pp__	BluesKaj	long story short you said "there is new fglrx prerelease driver available that works" - how do i install it? :)
