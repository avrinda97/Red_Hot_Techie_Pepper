2009-01-05T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	idesperado	why?
2009-01-05T18:02:00.000Z	idesperado	jrib	why??
2009-01-05T18:02:00.000Z	jrib	idesperado	yes.  Why do you you want to exactly?  Since the reason you want to affects how you would...
2009-01-05T18:04:00.000Z	idesperado	jrib	can you help me with my question?
2009-01-05T18:04:00.000Z	jrib	idesperado	You never answered mine.  Do you just not want X to startup by default forever?
2009-01-05T18:05:00.000Z	idesperado	jrib	...no...I wanna start x from cli with startx...
2009-01-05T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	idesperado	system -> administration -> services, disable graphical login
2009-01-05T18:06:00.000Z	idesperado	jrib	.....I'm not using gnome...
2009-01-05T18:06:00.000Z	jrib	idesperado	........ what are you using..........?

2009-01-05T18:07:00.000Z	idesperado	jrib	and I'm not boot into gnome env
2009-01-05T18:07:00.000Z	jrib	idesperado	If you don't have 'services-admin', then either install it or install sysv-rc-conf and use that to stop gdm from starting on runlevels 2-5
2009-01-05T18:08:00.000Z	idesperado	jrib	sysv-rc-conf.....can you tell which files decide and I can configure manually???
2009-01-05T18:08:00.000Z	jrib	idesperado	man update-rc.d
2009-01-05T18:09:00.000Z	idesperado	jrib	like the old /etc/inittab
2009-01-05T18:09:00.000Z	jrib	idesperado	runlevels 2-5 are identical by default so inittab isn't relevant
2009-01-05T18:10:00.000Z	jrib	idesperado	if you want to know how to use inittab for other reasons, see upstart.ubuntu.com.  It's not helpful here though
2009-01-05T18:10:00.000Z	idesperado	jrib	...runlevel 2-5 r identical???...I remembered runlevel 5 is graphical...
2009-01-05T18:11:00.000Z	jrib	idesperado	not on debian (and not on ubuntu)
2009-01-05T18:11:00.000Z	idesperado	jrib	no I'm not bothering with inittab...
