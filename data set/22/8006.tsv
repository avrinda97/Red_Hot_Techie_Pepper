2005-11-10T06:39:00.000Z	Inchabod		How can I add files to a NTFS slave harddrive?
2005-11-10T06:40:00.000Z	Inchabod		It's already mounted.
2005-11-10T06:40:00.000Z	mustard5	Inchabod	in general terms linux can't write to ntfs
2005-11-10T06:40:00.000Z	Inchabod	mustard5	How can I change general terms?
2005-11-10T06:40:00.000Z	Inchabod		lol
2005-11-10T06:40:00.000Z	mustard5	Inchabod	buy software that does the job :)
2005-11-10T06:41:00.000Z	mustard5	Inchabod	or set up a vfat partition to put stuff on..then transfer from vfat to ntfs in windows
2005-11-10T06:41:00.000Z	Inchabod		will that hurt my files?
2005-11-10T06:41:00.000Z	Inchabod		I got like 30gb of files on that hd.
2005-11-10T06:41:00.000Z	mustard5	Inchabod	will what hurt your files?
2005-11-10T06:42:00.000Z	mustard5	Inchabod	repartitioning your drive?
2005-11-10T06:42:00.000Z	Inchabod		Yeah
2005-11-10T06:42:00.000Z	mustard5	Inchabod	there is always potential for that yes...so backup before repartitioning
2005-11-10T06:42:00.000Z	Inchabod		Hmm oh well I think i'll just not back up these songs.
2005-11-10T06:42:00.000Z	Inchabod		Because it's my biggest hd
2005-11-10T06:42:00.000Z	Inchabod		with all the files.
2005-11-10T06:43:00.000Z	mustard5	Inchabod	you got an external usb device of some kind?
2005-11-10T06:43:00.000Z	mustard5	Inchabod	you could get an external usb drive formatted in vfat
2005-11-10T06:43:00.000Z	Inchabod	mustard5	Probably a flash drive
2005-11-10T06:43:00.000Z	Inchabod		nothing big.
2005-11-10T06:43:00.000Z	mustard5	Inchabod	k..well thats the state of affairs anyway :)
2005-11-10T06:45:00.000Z	mustard5	Inchabod	the reasons why are a bit long winded to go into here of course :)
