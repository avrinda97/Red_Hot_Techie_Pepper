2011-11-22T16:42:00.000Z	mazda01		anyone use passphrase ssh. i've been bothered by an issue forever and now i want to fix it. i have a file located in my home folder .ssh named id_rsa and everytime I log into an ssh server it first asks me what that passphrase and then I have to enter the password on the server I am trying to reach.
2011-11-22T16:42:00.000Z	mazda01		what gives with that, is that normal
2011-11-22T16:43:00.000Z	republic	mazda01	do you have your home directory encrypted?
2011-11-22T16:43:00.000Z	mazda01	republic	no
2011-11-22T16:43:00.000Z	mazda01	republic	maybe i am not suppose to have a file called id_rsa located within /home/daniel/.ssh/
2011-11-22T16:44:00.000Z	republic		I will point you into a website. Wait for seconds, I will get it for you
2011-11-22T16:44:00.000Z	republic		https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys
2011-11-22T16:44:00.000Z	republic	mazda01	please take a look at the site
2011-11-22T16:45:00.000Z	republic		look at the troubleshooting
2011-11-22T16:45:00.000Z	mazda01	republic	ok, thanks
2011-11-22T16:48:00.000Z	mazda01	republic	i've been using ubuntu since 2005 and like to thinkk i am pretty well versed on most things. i read that website and that's how i am setup BUT what I am saying is that i justr added a new machine on my network, it has ssh enabled but only to the internal network. it has password auth only, not key pair. WHY would i need to enter my passphrase to access it IF it only has password auth? that's my question I guess
2011-11-22T16:51:00.000Z	republic	mazda01	I am affraid I have no enough knowledge to answer your question. But, you can freely ask the question in #openssh if there is no one yet here answer your question
2011-11-22T16:52:00.000Z	mazda01	republic	awesome, thanks for pointing me to that channel. I appreciate it!
2011-11-22T16:54:00.000Z	republic		akubudakbaru, welcome, selamat datang :D
2011-11-22T17:17:00.000Z	mazda01	republic	just an FYI, i temp moved the ~/.ssh/id_rsa file and now i am only prompted to enter the password for the ssh server I am trying to connect to
2011-11-22T17:23:00.000Z	republic	mazda01	glad to hear that. But, I am currious with your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file. May I know whether PasswordAuthentication set to yes or no?
2011-11-22T17:23:00.000Z	republic	mazda01	I know perhaps it has nothing to do with your problem, but I am just curious
2011-11-22T17:24:00.000Z	mazda01	republic	you asking for that from the server i am trying to connect to OR the client on I am right now.
2011-11-22T17:24:00.000Z	republic		the server, if the machine belong to you
2011-11-22T17:28:00.000Z	mazda01	republic	on my client (comp I am sitting at) it's PasswordAuthentication no
2011-11-22T17:45:00.000Z	mazda01	republic	off course on the server i am trying to connect to it's Yes
2011-11-22T17:49:00.000Z	republic	mazda01	thank you. you have sate my curiosity
