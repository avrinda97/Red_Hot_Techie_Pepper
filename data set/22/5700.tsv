2007-03-24T13:44:00.000Z	Andeh		Can i burn ubuntu to a DVD?
2007-03-24T13:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Andeh	yeah, and if you want, there are DVDs as well.
2007-03-24T13:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Andeh	You should be fine.  People have done it before.
2007-06-23T14:07:00.000Z	Flannel	Andeh	it is.
2007-06-23T14:07:00.000Z	Andeh	Flannel	Then why did everyone else before you guys reccomend using it? I installed google earth, and lots of other things with it
2007-06-23T14:08:00.000Z	Flannel	Andeh	Because they're stupid and don't know any better.  We've NEVER recommended it.
2007-06-23T14:08:00.000Z	Flannel	Andeh	"before you guys" means "not in IRC", andeven then.
2007-06-23T14:09:00.000Z	Andeh	Flannel	Means you werent the one that reccomended it.
2007-06-23T14:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Andeh	We also don't provide support for Swiftfox (because it's not Free, well, and most of us haven't ever used it), but it should use similar, if not identical, directory structure to FF.
2007-06-23T14:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Andeh	Pidgin was released after Feisty was.  It'll be in Gutsy (well, it already is)
2007-06-23T14:11:00.000Z	Andeh	Flannel	It's not free because it IS free, but compiled optimised.
2007-06-23T14:12:00.000Z	Andeh	Flannel	In other words, there's nothing in it that's needs to be free
2007-06-23T14:12:00.000Z	Andeh	Flannel	it's just a compiled binary of something that is free.
2007-06-23T14:12:00.000Z	Flannel	Andeh	It is not Free.  It's illegal to distribute it.  But again, it should be identical to FF (unless he's done stupid things)
2007-06-23T14:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Andeh	No, I've told you.  None of us have used it.  BUT the directory structure SHOULD be identical.  And no, the guy who made swiftfox made it illegal to distribute it.
2007-06-23T14:15:00.000Z	Andeh	Flannel	No to what? We both know that.
2007-06-23T14:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Andeh	No.  We have never used swiftfox.  Why would we have any idea?  It *should* behave just like FF.
2007-06-23T14:16:00.000Z	Andeh	Flannel	Um... k...
2007-06-23T14:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Andeh	try http://forums.getswiftfox.com/
2007-06-23T14:29:00.000Z	Flannel	Andeh	it sets up the environment better for GUI's.  Using sudo you can get locking issues with stuff in your homedir
2008-06-19T09:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Andeh	Spore doesn't work anywhere yet.
2008-06-19T09:38:00.000Z	Andeh	Flannel	Yes it does. My friend just sent me screenshots of genitals he made in it
