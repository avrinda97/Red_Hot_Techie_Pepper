2006-10-06T08:42:00.000Z	syke		hi. after apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade yesterday and then a reboot, my dhclient segfaults consistently
2006-10-06T08:42:00.000Z	syke		I'm having to use another computer to be on the IRC channel
2006-10-06T08:42:00.000Z	syke		anyone seen something like this?
2006-10-06T08:43:00.000Z	syke		hi
2006-10-06T08:43:00.000Z	syke		is this #ubuntu-help?
2006-10-06T08:43:00.000Z	syke		I sure could use some help
2006-10-06T08:43:00.000Z	sethk	syke	yes.  ask a question.
2006-10-06T08:44:00.000Z	sethk	syke	that's odd.  any idea why?
2006-10-06T08:44:00.000Z	sethk	syke	do you know how to use a core file?
2006-10-06T08:45:00.000Z	syke	sethk	it crashes under gdb also
2006-10-06T08:45:00.000Z	sethk	syke	of course
2006-10-06T08:46:00.000Z	sethk	syke	it had better.  do you know how to interpret the gdb stack trace?
2006-10-06T08:46:00.000Z	syke	sethk	yes, I'm very familiar with gdb; but there's no symbols
2006-10-06T08:46:00.000Z	sethk	syke	if you can paste the stack trace onto the paste web site, we might get lucky and recognize something
2006-10-06T08:49:00.000Z	sethk	syke	you might try reinstalling the package that includes the dhclient program.
2006-10-06T08:50:00.000Z	syke	sethk	hm, ok.
2006-10-06T08:50:00.000Z	sethk	syke	hard to know without much more info.
2006-10-06T08:51:00.000Z	sethk	syke	probably not worth the time to track it down.
2006-10-06T08:51:00.000Z	syke	sethk	pastebin is being slow
2006-10-06T08:51:00.000Z	sethk	syke	k
2006-10-06T08:51:00.000Z	syke	sethk	http://pastebin.com/801137
2006-10-06T08:53:00.000Z	syke	sethk	any ideas?
