2007-05-06T13:24:00.000Z	dougsko	BigToe	you need to make a windows user that has the same username and password as on your ubuntu box
2007-05-06T13:27:00.000Z	BigToe	dougsko	do you know of a fix?
2007-05-06T13:28:00.000Z	dougsko	BigToe	give me a sec
2007-05-06T13:30:00.000Z	dougsko	BigToe	make sure your username and password are the same on both boxes. if theyre not, this will never work. once youre sure of that, try mounting the share using, the 'net share' command in windows.  it mounts the share manually, and ive had to use it before to do this. this site will help: http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/net_share.mspx?mfr=true
2007-05-06T13:30:00.000Z	dougsko	BigToe	and here: http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/file_srv_create_share.mspx?mfr=true
2007-05-06T13:30:00.000Z	BigToe	dougsko	erm... I'm using Vista :S
2007-05-06T13:31:00.000Z	dougsko	BigToe	whatev, thatll still probly work
2007-05-06T13:32:00.000Z	dougsko	BigToe	and you should probly ask in #windows too. but basically windows sucks so much that it cant even handle its own smb protocol properly. you wont have any of these problems when mounting samaba shares on a linux box
2007-05-06T13:36:00.000Z	BigToe	dougsko	I found one thing: my user account was Bigtoe on this PC and bigtoe on ubuntu
2007-05-06T13:37:00.000Z	dougsko	BigToe	yeah thatll cause problems
2007-05-06T13:38:00.000Z	dougsko	BigToe	dude, if youre talking to me, you need to prefix your statement with my nick, so i can see it :)
2007-05-06T13:38:00.000Z	BigToe	dougsko	I know. I'm used to small channels :P
2007-05-06T13:39:00.000Z	dougsko	BigToe	im tellin ya, try out the net share command. its like the manual way of doing what you want. and sometimes itll work when the "normal" way doesnt
2007-05-06T13:41:00.000Z	BigToe	dougsko	yay, it works!
2007-05-06T13:41:00.000Z	dougsko	BigToe	cool, howd you do it?
2007-05-06T13:41:00.000Z	dougsko	BigToe	good stuff
2007-05-06T13:41:00.000Z	BigToe	dougsko	I just did sudo smbpasswd -a system_username and entered the password
2007-05-06T13:41:00.000Z	BigToe	dougsko	of course, I replaced system_username with bigtoe :P
2007-05-06T13:42:00.000Z	dougsko	BigToe	nice
2007-05-06T13:42:00.000Z	BigToe	dougsko	now I need to install sshd so I can get my other monitor back on this PC :P
