2005-02-10T15:18:00.000Z	gepp1		Anyone in here know about jackit?
2005-02-10T15:19:00.000Z	LarstiQ	gepp1	yes
2005-02-10T15:20:00.000Z	gepp1	LarstiQ	 Is there any chance of it ever catching on?
2005-02-10T15:20:00.000Z	LarstiQ	gepp1	sure, I think it already has?
2005-02-10T15:20:00.000Z	gepp1	LarstiQ	 As it is, there are very few applications that use it.
2005-02-10T15:21:00.000Z	gepp1	LarstiQ	 The Ubuntu packages for it are largely broken.
2005-02-10T15:22:00.000Z	gepp1	LarstiQ	 The other thing;  even though it is good about latency, I'm getting lots of dropout, even with realtime enabled.
2005-02-10T15:23:00.000Z	LarstiQ	gepp1	hmm, what amounts are you thinking of when you say 'very few'?
2005-02-10T15:23:00.000Z	LarstiQ	gepp1	and qua drop outs, might want to patch your kernel
2005-02-10T15:24:00.000Z	gepp1	LarstiQ	 Well, Hydrogen, Ardour, XMMS... I have some applications happily working together, but the majority of things aren't JACK-enabled.  The gstreamer-jack package is broken, it appears.
2005-02-10T15:24:00.000Z	gepp1	LarstiQ	 How do you use the JACK plugin for ALSA?  I've downloaded libasound2-plugins, which is supposed to be the JACK plugin, but I'm not sure how to use it.
2005-02-10T15:24:00.000Z	LarstiQ	gepp1	ah, don't know about gstreamer
2005-02-10T15:25:00.000Z	gepp1	LarstiQ	 Alright.  XINE doesn't seem to be supported, and I don't really like MPlayer, but that's just preference.
2005-02-10T15:25:00.000Z	LarstiQ	gepp1	I'm only interested in producing sound, sequencers and synths. So if playback things are lacking, I wouldn't notice
2005-02-10T15:25:00.000Z	gepp1	LarstiQ	 Ah, alright.
2005-02-10T15:26:00.000Z	gepp1	LarstiQ	 As far as patching my kernel to fix dropouts;  isn't the realtime patch supposed to be relatively dangerous/insecure?
2005-02-10T15:26:00.000Z	LarstiQ	gepp1	Oh?
2005-02-10T15:27:00.000Z	gepp1	LarstiQ	 In the JACK documentation, it says that running JACK with realtime priorities can be dangerous, allowing a badly coded/malicious application to hang the entire system.
2005-02-10T15:28:00.000Z	LarstiQ	gepp1	potentially, yes
2005-02-10T15:28:00.000Z	LarstiQ	gepp1	but so is running configure install as root
2005-02-10T15:28:00.000Z	gepp1	LarstiQ	 Who runs configure as root?  =)
2005-02-10T15:29:00.000Z	LarstiQ	gepp1	doh, s/configure/make/
