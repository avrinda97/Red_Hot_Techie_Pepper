2009-10-03T01:52:00.000Z	fbdystang	modder	does ubuntu freeze on you by chance?
2009-10-03T01:52:00.000Z	modder	fbdystang	not at all man.. what's your problem?
2009-10-03T01:53:00.000Z	fbdystang	modder	well just built a new rig and it freezes randomly with ubuntu, I now have fedora running and it is stable. but i want ubuntu
2009-10-03T01:54:00.000Z	modder	fbdystang	well, what components did you build your pc with'?
2009-10-03T01:56:00.000Z	fbdystang	modder	intel DX58SO, 2x3 kingston triple channel ram. evga gtx 260
2009-10-03T01:57:00.000Z	modder	fbdystang	mmm that probably ubuntu doesn't like tthat gtx so much
2009-10-03T01:58:00.000Z	fbdystang	modder	what can i do for a workaround? what mobo you have?
2009-10-03T01:59:00.000Z	modder	fbdystang	well , it depends on whaht you expect your pc to do.. ar you a gamer? or what? i have a nice asus se p45 with socket 775
2009-10-03T02:01:00.000Z	fbdystang	modder	i only game every once in a while. mainly i need the extra resolution for multiple screens for work. why wouldn't ubuntu like the gtx260? is the card too new??
2009-10-03T02:03:00.000Z	modder	fbdystang	ok well.. you know there is always some problem with newest hardware out there..
2009-10-03T02:04:00.000Z	fbdystang	modder	I am a newbie to linux. how long do people usually have to wait for good drivers?
2009-10-03T02:05:00.000Z	modder	fbdystang	well it depends on what you want to do wih your pc, it depends on what you're looking for...
2009-10-03T02:07:00.000Z	fbdystang	modder	now that I have the card i just want stability. hehe
2009-10-03T02:08:00.000Z	modder	fbdystang	ahaha right well if you're finding yourself quite ok with fedora, why don't stick with it?
2009-10-03T02:09:00.000Z	fbdystang	modder	because of the cool people and support with ubuntu. should it be stable with karmic, maybe?
2009-10-03T02:11:00.000Z	modder	fbdystang	yes, it could absolutely be! i tell you my experience.. last year i culdn't use ubuntu 8.04 on my computers at all.. then when 8.10  came out i didn't now how but everything worked sucessfullly and i kept it :)
2009-10-03T02:12:00.000Z	fbdystang	modder	i wonder if i should attempt a prerelease of karmic?
2009-10-03T02:12:00.000Z	modder	fbdystang	no, wait the original release
2009-10-03T02:13:00.000Z	fbdystang	modder	may i ask why wait?
2009-10-03T02:15:00.000Z	modder	fbdystang	coz the prerelease is not stable in some cases and it has little "new" drivers compatibility .. the real new release is best because it is absolutely stable.. it is not a alpha release that is not complete
