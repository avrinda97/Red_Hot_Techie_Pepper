2006-02-24T10:57:00.000Z	damo21		Can someone help me, i really want an xfce ubuntu system but it seems to break things like printing.... is there a proper way to install xfce?
2006-02-24T10:58:00.000Z	damo21		yes i installed xubuntu-desktop, but what is xubuntu-live for??
2006-02-24T10:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	damo21	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2006-02-24T11:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	damo21	yes there will be (as far as we know)
2006-02-24T11:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	damo21	you can install xfce on breezy
2006-02-24T11:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	damo21	define breaks things
2006-02-24T11:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	damo21	im not real sure why. im assuming xubuntu-desktop is staying same in breezy
2006-02-24T11:06:00.000Z	damo21	gnomefreak	im hoping the permission bugs with HAL and stuff are fixed in dapper
2006-02-24T11:07:00.000Z	damo21	gnomefreak	for some reason, pmount is trying to automount the wrong partition on my usb sticks so i get an error every time i plug it in
2006-02-24T11:09:00.000Z	gnomefreak	damo21	you will have to wait and see if they include it in dapper last i heard was it will bve
2006-02-24T11:10:00.000Z	gnomefreak	damo21	yes
2006-02-24T12:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	damo21	fluxbox :)
2006-02-24T12:16:00.000Z	gnomefreak	damo21	i think xfce has that option in synaptic (extra package)
2006-02-24T12:16:00.000Z	gnomefreak	damo21	i cant tell you right now because xfce is broken in dapper
2006-02-24T12:16:00.000Z	damo21	gnomefreak	yes one day i will venture to fluxbox, but xfce works a charm in breezy
2006-02-24T12:18:00.000Z	damo21	gnomefreak	im all for using ubuntu endorsed window managers, when they fix xfce4 in dapper, i'll be upgrading
2006-02-24T12:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	damo21	they are upgrading xfce to newest version not sure how long it will be
2006-02-24T12:19:00.000Z	damo21	gnomefreak	cool, i can wait
2006-02-24T12:44:00.000Z	damo21	gnomefreak	why dont u have it
2006-02-24T12:44:00.000Z	gnomefreak	damo21	noone on dapper has it
2006-02-24T12:44:00.000Z	damo21	gnomefreak	awww sucks for you... im on 5.10 :D
