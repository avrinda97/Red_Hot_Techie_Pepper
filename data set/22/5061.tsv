2007-08-03T08:23:00.000Z	Smithers		Anyone have a suggestion for dealing with Rar archive files?
2007-08-03T08:24:00.000Z	neozen	Smithers	yeah... install unrar
2007-08-03T08:24:00.000Z	Smithers	neozen	I have using Synaptic but I'm unfamiliar on how to use it and there wasn't a good set of instructions around
2007-08-03T08:25:00.000Z	Smithers	neozen	ok
2007-08-03T08:25:00.000Z	neozen	Smithers	and type: sudo apt-get install unrar
2007-08-03T08:26:00.000Z	Smithers	neozen	I get a error saying that "unrar is not available. but is refrred to by another package"
2007-08-03T08:26:00.000Z	neozen	Smithers	no problem
2007-08-03T08:29:00.000Z	neozen	Smithers	if you're new to the terminal... I recommend following that guide
2007-08-03T08:29:00.000Z	Smithers	neozen	thanks, I will check it out now, I type the !rar command and I got a error about not have the GLIBC_2.4 (required by unrar) error
2007-08-03T08:30:00.000Z	Smithers	neozen	Yes
2007-08-03T08:30:00.000Z	neozen	Smithers	!rar is not a command
2007-08-03T08:30:00.000Z	neozen	Smithers	rar is
2007-08-03T08:30:00.000Z	Smithers	neozen	oh, sorry
2007-08-03T08:30:00.000Z	Smithers	neozen	I still ended up having that GLIBC_2.4 error
2007-08-03T08:31:00.000Z	neozen	Smithers	putting a exclamation point in front of words is usually done in irc when you want a bot to pay attention to what you're saying...
2007-08-03T08:31:00.000Z	neozen	Smithers	that's after installing unrar-free or unrar?
2007-08-03T08:32:00.000Z	Smithers	neozen	This was after I tried to apt-get the unrar
2007-08-03T08:33:00.000Z	neozen	Smithers	have you enabled the multiverse?
2007-08-03T08:33:00.000Z	Smithers	neozen	Actually I believe Unrar-Free is already installed on my system from yesterday when I did it with synaptic, I'm going to check out that link from the bot real quick on how to use it and I'll let you know what my progress is. Deal?
2007-08-03T08:34:00.000Z	neozen	Smithers	heh.. ok
2007-08-03T08:35:00.000Z	Smithers	neozen	Great, brb shortly
2007-08-03T10:31:00.000Z	Smithers	neozen	I never did get unrar to work but I'm still searching through the forums for an answer, I believe I've almost found the answer I'm just have to implement the different solutions I found. Got a quick question though, I lost my taskbar (with the applications, places, system, etc) on it how do I get it back?
