2008-08-09T14:31:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	hmm...im not understanding something.  if you want to back up everything, why do you want to reinstall in the first place?  are you trying to migrate from ubuntu 32-bit to ubuntu 64-bit?
2008-08-09T14:34:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	okay, then it sounds to me like you want to back up a few things then.  you want to backup your user data, and you want to have the same programs installed.  is that correct?
2008-08-09T14:34:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	ah.  Well then, clonezilla is not meant for that.
2008-08-09T14:36:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	in your case, what I would do is have Synaptic create a list of all the installed programs (if you do it through Synaptic, you don't have to worry about 32-bit/64-bit compatibility, etc), and copy the entire /home/username  (<-- whatever your username is) to your backup disk
2008-08-09T14:38:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	how many programs did you modify the config files for?  If its less than 10, i would suggest to simply copy them individually.
2008-08-09T14:39:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	system-wide settings (like networking, fstab, and xorg.conf) are not in the /home/username directory, so you will have to copy those yourself
2008-08-09T14:40:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	I dont know for sure, but my *guess* is probably.  So you want to copy /etc and /home/username to your backup media, and create a list of programs that you have installed.
2008-08-09T14:41:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	the only problem i can foresee is that i think some binaries are stored in /etc (anybody please correct me if im wrong), and so copying those binaries may break things
2008-08-09T14:43:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	any software setting that are specific to you are stored in /home/username
2008-08-09T14:46:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	To copy complete HDs or partitions, you can use Clonezilla.  But, if youre going to just copy everything back, it may be pointless.
2008-08-09T14:46:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	If you use the list of currently installed programs, installing programs becomes very easy
2008-08-09T14:49:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	reinstalling the OS will lose the currently install programs, yes.
2008-08-09T14:50:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	so, you basically want to roll back to your current state - ie before something gets messed up?
2008-08-09T14:51:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	okay...sorry it took me so long to understand that...seems I'm kind of slow tonight.
2008-08-09T14:52:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	then you will want to use Clonezilla
2008-08-09T14:53:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	i would backup the entire drive, or at least all of the Ubuntu partitions
2008-08-09T14:53:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	what are you backing up to?
2008-08-09T14:54:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	then i would just backup whatever partitions are in use by Ubuntu
2008-08-09T14:54:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	Actually, one sec, i may have a very useful link for you
2008-08-09T14:56:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	This page is not up-to-date yet, but I will try to get somebody to update it with how to get Clonezilla running and everything.  So, basically, just keep an eye on this page: http://ticc.mines.edu/csm/wiki/index.php/Imaging_Guide
2008-08-09T14:57:00.000Z	rustychicken	Silent123	np, good luck!  have fun messing around (its a great way to learn).
