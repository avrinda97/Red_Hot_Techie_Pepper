2007-07-08T16:30:00.000Z	rynb1n		i am trying to install ubuntu 7.04 on my macbook pro
2007-07-08T16:31:00.000Z	rynb1n		and i am running into x windows errors
2007-07-08T16:31:00.000Z	rynb1n		there is yes, and i guess i am aware of the problem and what i need to know how to do is
2007-07-08T16:31:00.000Z	rynb1n		how do you get into the manual text install of unbuntu
2007-07-08T16:32:00.000Z	rynb1n		so i can change the xserv.conf file
2007-07-08T16:32:00.000Z	Kryten107	rynb1n	that takes the alternate install CD
2007-07-08T16:33:00.000Z	Kryten107	rynb1n	actually yeah I just remembered how to do that
2007-07-08T16:33:00.000Z	Kryten107	rynb1n	well, when you boot the graphical LiveCD, everything works except X right?
2007-07-08T16:33:00.000Z	Kryten107	rynb1n	like, can you hear the drum beat?
2007-07-08T16:34:00.000Z	Kryten107	rynb1n	well when I'm installing on my laptop, the driver it defaults to doesn't work so I can't see anything but it makes the drum beat noise when it gets to where the login screen should be
2007-07-08T16:35:00.000Z	Kryten107	rynb1n	and then I just use Ctrl+Alt+F2 to switch into a terminal login and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg to switch to vesa
2007-07-08T16:36:00.000Z	Kryten107	rynb1n	well then the alternate cd is probably your best bet
2007-07-08T16:37:00.000Z	Kryten107	rynb1n	after you hear the startup noise that means it has booted properly and is at the GDM login screen
2007-07-08T16:38:00.000Z	Kryten107	rynb1n	well then the alternate cd is probably your best bet :P
2007-07-08T16:39:00.000Z	Kryten107	rynb1n	I'm not sure what they ship, but one of them might be the alternate CD, else you'd have to download an ISO
2007-07-08T16:41:00.000Z	Kryten107	rynb1n	it'll give you a similar menu to the regular CD, but instead of "Start Ubuntu" or whatever it'll have "Install Ubuntu with text installer"
2007-07-08T16:41:00.000Z	Kryten107	rynb1n	you're welcome
