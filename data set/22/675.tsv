2012-02-12T17:50:00.000Z	kalimojo		when i run fdisk -l i get "Disk /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 doesn't contain a valid partition table"
2012-02-12T17:50:00.000Z	ikonia	kalimojo	1.) you need to use sudo 2.) its an encypted device
2012-02-12T17:51:00.000Z	ikonia	kalimojo	then when you say what you did, you need to say "I did sudo fdisk -l" not "I did disk -l"
2012-02-12T17:52:00.000Z	kalimojo	ikonia	so that is a normal error message ?
2012-02-12T17:52:00.000Z	ikonia	kalimojo	it's not really an error message, the disk is encypted
2012-02-12T17:52:00.000Z	kalimojo	ikonia	: ok
2012-02-12T18:05:00.000Z	ikonia	kalimojo	you don't know, that is the massive risk/issue with PPAs
2012-02-12T18:06:00.000Z	ikonia	kalimojo	my personal research suggests there are VERY few that are safe to use
2012-02-16T19:42:00.000Z	kalimojo	ikonia	: what is the disk utility tool ?
2012-02-22T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	kalimojo	for what topic ?
2012-02-22T18:23:00.000Z	kalimojo	ikonia	: just general chat
2012-02-22T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	kalimojo	#defocus
2012-02-24T19:53:00.000Z	ikonia	kalimojo	depends if they know a security hole
2012-02-24T19:54:00.000Z	ikonia	kalimojo	if the person writing the attack knows of a security hole, sure
2012-02-24T19:54:00.000Z	ikonia	kalimojo	I can break into fort knocks if I know there is a hole in their security
2012-02-24T19:56:00.000Z	kalimojo	ikonia	: are you saying firefox is vulnerable ?
2012-02-24T19:57:00.000Z	ikonia	kalimojo	all software "may" be vulnerable the problem is you don't know of a vulnerablility until someone finds it
2012-02-24T19:57:00.000Z	kalimojo	ikonia	: are there any KNOWN vulnerabilities in FIREFOX ? that you know of ?
2012-02-24T19:58:00.000Z	ikonia	kalimojo	check the securit CVE reports, that will show you current alerts and versions
2012-03-01T17:06:00.000Z	ikonia	kalimojo	unity is gnome,
2012-03-01T17:07:00.000Z	kalimojo	ikonia	i want the gnome shell
2012-03-01T17:07:00.000Z	ikonia	kalimojo	then follow the info ubottu just gave you
