2011-03-10T10:19:00.000Z	LorgonJortle		I've uploaded an .ogv file and setup JWplayer on my site. When I view it in Chromium, it works just fine. If I view it in Firefox, however, it says there was an error, or it couldn't find the file. I've had multiple people on Windows tries it, too... none of them had it working.

2011-03-10T10:21:00.000Z	LorgonJortle		I'm sorry. This is the appropriate link: http://jyrangames.com/VideoTutorials/UnderstandingLOGL_GLib.html
2011-03-10T10:21:00.000Z	te	LorgonJortle	You can use mplayer or vlc.  (I prefer mplayer). Tell your windows users to try vlc.
2011-03-10T10:21:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	te	So you recommend just ditching JWPlayer?
2011-03-10T10:23:00.000Z	te	LorgonJortle	Or gxine... but that one.. I dono, I can't even get it to come up in gxine.  So I dono...
2011-03-10T10:24:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	te	Alright. Thanks for the suggestions.
2011-03-10T10:24:00.000Z	te	LorgonJortle	Oh I don't know.  I don't even know what JWPlayer is.  Never used it.
2011-03-10T10:25:00.000Z	te	LorgonJortle	You're going to have to ask someone else about this one.   I'm not able to access it at all.
2011-03-10T10:31:00.000Z	te	LorgonJortle	Is this a video that YOU are trying to share?
2011-03-10T10:31:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	te	It's my video that I've uploaded onto my website, yes.
2011-03-10T10:33:00.000Z	te	LorgonJortle	How long of a video is it?  (Time wize)?
2011-03-10T10:33:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	te	18 min
2011-03-10T10:33:00.000Z	te	LorgonJortle	Why don't you just share it via youtube?
2011-03-10T10:34:00.000Z	te	LorgonJortle	You can embed it from youtube on your website
2011-03-10T10:34:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	te	Time constraints + quality.
2011-03-10T10:35:00.000Z	te	LorgonJortle	Like this:  http://trryhend.startlogic.com/   (Just an example)
2011-03-10T10:41:00.000Z	te	LorgonJortle	Here is the way david miller does it, (maybe you can get a clue from his usage). See:  http://dave.frop.net/introduction_drupal_screencast
2011-03-10T10:42:00.000Z	te	LorgonJortle	Firefox supports ogv
2011-03-10T11:52:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	te	Does that work for you? http://jyrangames.com/VideoTutorials/UnderstandingLOGL_GLib.html
2011-03-10T11:56:00.000Z	te	LorgonJortle	Nope.  Just shows a green box in the upper left corner.
2011-03-10T12:01:00.000Z	te	LorgonJortle	Here is a portion of the code from Dave's page:  http://pastebin.com/czRY4xQq
2011-03-10T12:02:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	te	I've the same exact code now (trying it without JWPlayer) and it still works in Chromium, but not in FF.
