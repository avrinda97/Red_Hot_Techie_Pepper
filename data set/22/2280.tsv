2011-09-11T09:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	aaron11	 whats the exact nvidia chipset in use?
2011-09-11T09:55:00.000Z	aaron11	dr_willis	Its not nvidia
2011-09-11T11:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	aaron11	 so the plymouth animation works? but the login screen is all dark?
2011-09-11T11:22:00.000Z	aaron11	dr_willis	well not really but its just a blank purple screen first, then it goes dark and you can see the ubuntu logo in the purple screen then goes into login screen
2011-09-11T11:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	aaron11	 so you are using an nvidia video chipset?
2011-09-11T11:23:00.000Z	aaron11	dr_willis	Asked this question here before, maybe you dont remember. Im using intel card
2011-09-11T11:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	aaron11	 im lucky to rember my own name.
2011-09-11T11:23:00.000Z	aaron11	dr_willis	Well it is going dark
2011-09-11T11:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	aaron11	 the live cd - worked properly?
2011-09-11T11:24:00.000Z	aaron11	dr_willis	Well, the first boot, no, same problems. Second boot yes, it worked fine. I thought it was just something small that went wrong so I just installed it
2011-09-11T11:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	aaron11	 Hmm.. tested a live cd lately?  It would suck if this is actually some hardware issue you are chaseing.
2011-09-11T11:25:00.000Z	aaron11	dr_willis	No, it worked fin in fedora 14
2011-09-11T11:25:00.000Z	aaron11	dr_willis	Its a similar problem that I experienced with Gnome 3 in Fedora 15

2011-09-11T11:27:00.000Z	aaron11	dr_willis	This guy has the same problem, going to try his solution.
2011-09-11T11:29:00.000Z	aaron11	dr_willis	It could be the problem with the newest kernels
2011-09-11T11:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	aaron11	 tried  the beta release yet?
2011-09-11T11:29:00.000Z	aaron11	dr_willis	How can I get an older kernel?
2011-09-11T11:29:00.000Z	aaron11	dr_willis	The Beta of 11.10?
2011-09-11T11:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	aaron11	 they are in the repos i belive. ive rarely needed them
2011-09-11T11:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	aaron11	 if it dont work properly. it would be worthit to file a bug befor release
2011-09-11T11:31:00.000Z	aaron11	dr_willis	hmm... im going to reboot with the changes ive made to the rc.local. If it doesnt work ill come back.
