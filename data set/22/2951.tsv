2009-01-13T23:06:00.000Z	Damaki		I'm new to Ubuntu, I've just installed 8.10 on my desktop but I can't connect to a wireless network since I can't for the life of me find the option to do so. Right clicking on the Network Manager in the top taskbar gives me the option to edit connections which I have done, but there's no option to actually connect to the network.
2009-01-13T23:06:00.000Z	Damaki		The help file tells me to go to System -> Administration -> Network
2009-01-13T23:06:00.000Z	Damaki		But that option does not exist in the Administration menu
2009-01-13T23:06:00.000Z	Damaki		It should be.

2009-01-13T23:33:00.000Z	Damaki	Jack_Sparrow	it's no problem. I just need to get some drivers for my wireless adapter, which I thought would work but the version I have actually requires ndiswrapper and some 64-bit drivers :/

2009-01-13T23:52:00.000Z	Damaki	Jack_Sparrow	Those are the same drivers that are in the guide that I'm following. However, the guide states that those drivers don't work on the amd64 platform (which is what I'm on), and in which case, I should instead use the 3rd party drivers which it links to the forums. I'll wait for the forums to come back up instead.
2009-01-13T23:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Damaki	I tried
2009-01-13T23:52:00.000Z	Damaki	Jack_Sparrow	yeah, much appreciated!!
