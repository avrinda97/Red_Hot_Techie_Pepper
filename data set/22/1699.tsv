2010-02-13T22:08:00.000Z	IanWizard		I don't know who to inform about this.  But every time I try to download 9.10 desktop iso,  I get UNR instead.  I've done 64, and 32 bit.  Both go the respective UNR iso.

2011-04-10T20:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	IanWizard	you have to get a library for that texturwe compression to work with open source graphic drivers
2011-04-10T20:31:00.000Z	IanWizard	erUSUL	I assumed that it was a lib, but I have no idea which one, and when I search the repos, I can't find anything.
2011-04-10T20:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	IanWizard	well the problem is that the texture compression tech is patented that's why linux distro can not enable it by default
2011-04-10T20:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	IanWizard	the same happens with mp3 and a lot of other things that's why medibuntu exists
2011-04-10T20:34:00.000Z	IanWizard	erUSUL	(and restricted repos ;) )
2011-04-10T20:35:00.000Z	IanWizard	erUSUL	ok, so I need to find the right texture compression lib for the driver, wm, or app/engine?
2011-04-10T20:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	IanWizard	is for the graphic driver /mesa/lidrm etc ...
2011-04-10T20:35:00.000Z	IanWizard	erUSUL	nouveau
2011-04-10T20:36:00.000Z	IanWizard	erUSUL	ok, thank you :)

2011-04-10T20:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	IanWizard	if you use the propietary driver you will have no problem
2011-04-10T20:38:00.000Z	IanWizard	erUSUL	oh, wow, thanks :D

2011-04-10T21:01:00.000Z	IanWizard	erUSUL	thanks for the driver help :)
2011-04-17T02:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	IanWizard	use another terminal emulator
2011-04-17T02:52:00.000Z	IanWizard	erUSUL	Dr_Willis: I know that I could SIGSTOP it, but I still can't restart it and redirect the output (such as fg > /dev/tty1)
2011-04-17T02:52:00.000Z	IanWizard	erUSUL	I wan't thinking, or I would have.
