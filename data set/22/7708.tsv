2008-12-13T16:30:00.000Z	Kenny		Not quit sure.. I have a Nobilis laptop
2008-12-13T16:32:00.000Z	Kenny		All I hear is crackling in my speakers.  They worked for a couple weeks and then... nothing.
2008-12-13T16:33:00.000Z	Kenny		Im not dual booted.  Only OS is Ubuntu 8.10
2008-12-13T16:33:00.000Z	Kenny		No.. they are internal.
2008-12-13T16:34:00.000Z	Kenny		Not sure... I have a Nobilis laptop Tiyowan.
2008-12-13T16:35:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Kenny	Google keywords: Nobilis <your model number here> Sound
2008-12-13T16:35:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Kenny	Or instead of sound, Specs
2008-12-13T16:50:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Kenny	Generally, sound "drivers" are built into the kernel or compiled as modules.
2008-12-13T16:51:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Kenny	Was it working before?
2008-12-13T16:53:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Kenny	Have you used pulseaudio before?
2008-12-13T16:53:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Kenny	Then, try this, for curiosity if you're interested. Use the ubuntu package manager to uninstall pulseaudio, perhaps.
2008-12-13T16:54:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Kenny	Depends, really.. In the past I had a lot of trouble getting pulseaudio to do what I wanted, how I wanted, but that has been a long while back.
2008-12-13T16:59:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Kenny	Hmm.. Just for curiosity, try rebooting, now, I hate to suggest that idea, but is is, in this case, an easier quick test.
2008-12-13T17:07:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Kenny	Good question. I don't like pulseaudio, until it actually does something useful, like auto-direct sound to a USB headset, when plugged in, but I could never get hotswapping working right. ;)
2008-12-13T17:09:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Kenny	No problem. Perhaps later if you're feeling resourceful, and could find need for something like PulseAudio, later you can try actually solving it, but for now, at least it's working as expected.
2008-12-13T17:13:00.000Z	Kenny	Psi-Jack	Not to bug you with irrelevent questions... but how much do you know about Ubuntu and how long did it take you to get there??  What steps did you take??
2008-12-13T17:13:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Kenny	I have been using Linux since just a little before version 1.0 was FINALLY released. ;)
