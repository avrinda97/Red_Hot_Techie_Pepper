2010-07-07T02:25:00.000Z	tim_		I was using smuxi perfectly until I changed the preferences and now I can't open the program. It keeps crashing. I tried reinstalling with no luck. Any suggestions?
2010-07-07T02:25:00.000Z	slidinghorn	tim_	when you uninstalled, did you purge the config files?   sudo apt-get remove --purge appname
2010-07-07T02:27:00.000Z	tim_	slidinghorn	yes. Then, I reinstall and it doesn't launch.
2010-07-07T02:27:00.000Z	slidinghorn	tim_	have you launched it from command line (I personally don't know what smuxi is, so if that's the only way to launch, forgive me)?  what error messages are you given (use http://paste.ubuntu.com for multiple lines)

2010-07-07T02:34:00.000Z	tim_	slidinghorn	Any luck?
2010-07-07T02:35:00.000Z	slidinghorn	tim_	haven't found anything yet....still looking
2010-07-07T02:36:00.000Z	tim_	slidinghorn	Thanks. Maybe there is a problem with the build. I'm thinking since it's giving "Smuxi.Frontend.Gnome" that's a problem with the actual code, not the config.
2010-07-07T02:39:00.000Z	tim_	slidinghorn	Thanks for your help man. I'm thinking that it's a problem with the actual build. Nothing we can do. Thanks again!
2010-07-07T02:39:00.000Z	slidinghorn	tim_	if you'd like i can try to take a look at the config file...you can pastebin it, just make sure that you take your passwords out of it before posting
2010-07-07T02:40:00.000Z	tim_	slidinghorn	I can't even find the config file. It's not in my home or in /usr/share. I can't even find anything in gconf-editor
2010-07-07T02:40:00.000Z	slidinghorn	tim_	what about in ~/.config/smuxi/smuxi-engine.ini
2010-07-07T02:41:00.000Z	tim_	slidinghorn	Aha. Let me get that for you.
2010-07-07T02:41:00.000Z	slidinghorn	tim_	remember to remove your password(s)
2010-07-07T02:44:00.000Z	tim_	slidinghorn	http://paste.ubuntu.com/459995/ thanks so much.
2010-07-07T02:44:00.000Z	slidinghorn	tim_	no guarantees, as I have no experience with that program, but I'll try :)
2010-07-07T02:45:00.000Z	tim_	slidinghorn	thanks. If we can't make progress, can I just delete that .ini file?
2010-07-07T02:49:00.000Z	slidinghorn	tim_	sorry, couldn't find anything that was out of place :-\
2010-07-07T02:49:00.000Z	tim_	slidinghorn	AHA! I deleted it and restarted the program and it's fixed.
2010-07-07T02:49:00.000Z	tim_	slidinghorn	Thanks for your help!
2010-07-07T02:51:00.000Z	slidinghorn	tim_	glad you got it working...sorry I couldn't be of more assistance though :)
2010-07-07T02:52:00.000Z	tim_	slidinghorn	But you helped a lot! I wouldn't have found that config file without you!
