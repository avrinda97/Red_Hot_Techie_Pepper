2007-09-07T09:00:00.000Z	CountX		im getting some serious errors when trying to install ubuntu
2007-09-07T09:00:00.000Z	CountX		can anyone help
2007-09-07T09:00:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CountX	what kinda errors
2007-09-07T09:02:00.000Z	CountX	MasterShrek	it goes fine until it goes to load hardware drivers, where it fails to load the drivers for my wireless card, then it goes to "loading kernel modules..." and its still there....
2007-09-07T09:02:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CountX	and thats during the install correct? not the subsequent boot?
2007-09-07T09:03:00.000Z	CountX	MasterShrek	yes
2007-09-07T09:03:00.000Z	CountX	MasterShrek	its still there and wont go any further
2007-09-07T09:03:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CountX	can you disable your wireless card using a switch or in the bios just for the install?
2007-09-07T09:04:00.000Z	CountX	MasterShrek	im trying that right now
2007-09-07T09:08:00.000Z	CountX	MasterShrek	its still freezing but at a dif point
2007-09-07T09:08:00.000Z	CountX	MasterShrek	its at "activating swapfile swap..."
2007-09-07T09:10:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CountX	i think theres a way to boot that livecd without using swap, but i dont know how
2007-09-07T09:11:00.000Z	CountX	MasterShrek	what reason would there be for it not working?
2007-09-07T09:13:00.000Z	CountX	MasterShrek	the latest
2007-09-07T09:14:00.000Z	CountX	MasterShrek	i think somethng is happening now
2007-09-07T09:14:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CountX	beats me, i dunno why it would be hanging on swap
2007-09-07T09:15:00.000Z	CountX	MasterShrek	it went through that first boot stuff, and is now on a black screen
2007-09-07T09:19:00.000Z	CountX	MasterShrek	noapic nolapic acpi=off, that added to the boot options fixed it
2007-09-07T09:20:00.000Z	CountX	MasterShrek	the audio is all glitchy though....any reason for that?
2007-09-07T09:20:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CountX	yea i guess i didnt think of that, never had to use it, but ive heard it will work somtimes
2007-09-07T09:21:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CountX	you have to remember the entire os that you are entering is loading from a cd, much slower than a hard drive
2007-09-07T09:22:00.000Z	CountX	MasterShrek	its still loading the setup dialog....
