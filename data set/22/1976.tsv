2009-11-18T13:13:00.000Z	gwinbee		has anyone attempted to connect a realvnc enterprise viewer to vino (as in windows computer with the viewer, ubuntu with the server)? i'm getting a "no matching security types" error viewer-side.
2009-11-18T13:14:00.000Z	Spixx	gwinbee	try rdesktop?
2009-11-18T13:15:00.000Z	gwinbee	Spixx	i'm not sure if i'm using rdesktop or not, honestly. i attempted to set up remote viewing via system->preferences->remote desktop. i was under the impression that that was vino.
2009-11-18T13:16:00.000Z	Spixx	gwinbee	when I remote I use rdesktop it handles RDP well.
2009-11-18T13:18:00.000Z	gwinbee	Spixx	RDP? i don't know what that is, i'm sorry.
2009-11-18T13:18:00.000Z	Spixx	gwinbee	you are trying to remote against a windows host or?
2009-11-18T13:18:00.000Z	gwinbee	Spixx	ubuntu is the server, windows is the client
2009-11-18T13:19:00.000Z	gwinbee	Spixx	right
2009-11-18T13:20:00.000Z	Spixx	gwinbee	and you get an auth error?
2009-11-18T13:20:00.000Z	gwinbee	Spixx	also, seriously, #ubuntu is under attack by script kiddies? feels awful 1998 in here :)
2009-11-18T13:21:00.000Z	gwinbee	Spixx	perhaps i should try a different server ubuntu-side?
2009-11-18T13:22:00.000Z	Spixx	gwinbee	tightVNC server and thightvnc client is a protip :D
2009-11-18T13:23:00.000Z	gwinbee	Spixx	any idea if tightvnc server will be ok with realvnc viewer?
2009-11-18T13:23:00.000Z	Spixx	gwinbee	what type of server do you use?
2009-11-18T13:23:00.000Z	Spixx	gwinbee	nah sorry :/
2009-11-18T13:24:00.000Z	gwinbee	Spixx	like i said, i honestly don't even know what the VNC server is. it is whatever i access by going through system - preferences - remote desktop
2009-11-18T13:24:00.000Z	gwinbee	Spixx	i thought it was vino, but i could easily be wrong.
2009-11-18T13:25:00.000Z	Spixx	gwinbee	ahh, now I see, perhaps you need to try and use a standalone VNC server because I do not know what type this is :S
2009-11-18T13:26:00.000Z	gwinbee	Spixx	fair enough. in fact, i think i recall using tightvnc for this very purpose a long time ago.
2009-11-18T13:27:00.000Z	Spixx	gwinbee	yeah, I think that would be simpler. Got the feeling that the ubuntu way is for between ubuntu machines only
2009-11-18T13:27:00.000Z	gwinbee	Spixx	or realvnc is just a PITA :) thanks though, i'm off.
2009-11-18T13:27:00.000Z	Spixx	gwinbee	np have fun
