2005-04-14T08:47:00.000Z	bwlang	Dreamer3	dunno... but that happens when all of your processes don't go away after you quit your X session... do a ps aux | grep `whoami` at the command prompt to see what you're still running and kill those tasks (with a -9 signal if necessary)
2005-04-14T08:47:00.000Z	Dreamer3	bwlang	no, it happens before i start X the first time
2005-04-14T08:48:00.000Z	Dreamer3	bwlang	it was my sound... guess the driver wasn't fulled supporting... kill esd allowed gnome to startup
2005-04-14T08:48:00.000Z	Dreamer3	bwlang	i should get a forum accound and post taht
2005-04-14T08:49:00.000Z	bwlang	Dreamer3	bummer... i bet it will time out eventually  but it shouldn't block.
2005-04-14T08:49:00.000Z	Dreamer3	bwlang	agreed, but 5 minutes is too long to wait :)
2005-04-14T08:49:00.000Z	Dreamer3	bwlang	it was a big problem, few threads on the forums
2005-04-14T08:55:00.000Z	Dreamer3	bwlang	that's why i told his DSL
2005-04-14T08:55:00.000Z	Dreamer3	bwlang	it's a fun little distro
2005-04-14T08:55:00.000Z	Dreamer3	bwlang	i'm wanting to setup a PC with no moving parts running it now
2005-04-14T08:56:00.000Z	bwlang	Dreamer3	for no moving parts leaf is a great choice...

2005-04-14T08:57:00.000Z	Dreamer3	bwlang	true, depends on what he wants to do :)

2005-04-14T08:58:00.000Z	Dreamer3	bwlang	one of the CD drives is a bit flakey, but i think it was a good deal :)
2005-04-14T08:59:00.000Z	Dreamer3	bwlang	i had someone give me a XP 1800/128mb/20gig with a non-functional ME install... system was fine :)
