2007-02-05T15:29:00.000Z	xtknight		what's the package name for audacious?
2007-02-05T15:29:00.000Z	xtknight		looks just like xmms to be honest
2007-02-05T15:29:00.000Z	Stormx2	xtknight	Its not in the default edgy repos
2007-02-05T15:30:00.000Z	Stormx2	xtknight	Its an awful lot more up-to-date and usable
2007-02-05T15:30:00.000Z	xtknight	Stormx2	giving svn a shot..
2007-03-11T16:50:00.000Z	Stormx2	xtknight	ext3...
2007-03-11T16:51:00.000Z	xtknight	Stormx2	ext3 is not compatible with a windows driver for writing
2007-03-11T16:51:00.000Z	xtknight	Stormx2	afaik at least, ext3 uses journaling i dont believe the IFS driver has implemented that yet.  though it is backwards compatible it's probably a poor idea to write on ext3 with an ext2 driver
2007-03-11T16:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	xtknight	I could have sworn I've had write permission to an ext3 partition... 1 mo.
2007-03-11T16:52:00.000Z	xtknight	Stormx2	crimsun: gotcha.  i had just read somewhere else that it probably wasn't the best idea
2007-03-11T16:55:00.000Z	Stormx2	xtknight	Lazy ;)
2007-03-11T16:56:00.000Z	xtknight	Stormx2	gotcha, ext3 writing doesnt require a journal
2007-03-11T06:26:00.000Z	xtknight	Stormx2	that doesn't make much sense
2007-03-11T06:54:00.000Z	xtknight	Stormx2	IndyGunFreak, lachlan121 may have HW problems.
2007-03-25T07:46:00.000Z	xtknight	Stormx2	what do you mean the entire doc?
2007-03-25T07:46:00.000Z	xtknight	Stormx2	firefox should be checking the whole text box
2007-03-25T07:46:00.000Z	Stormx2	xtknight	I don't want it limited to text box. I'm designing something in XHTML...
2007-03-25T07:47:00.000Z	xtknight	Stormx2	oh.  hmm i dont know many Composer can do it?
2007-04-30T15:48:00.000Z	Stormx2	xtknight	How come?
2008-07-12T01:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	xtknight	that's only one of the steps.
2008-07-12T01:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	xtknight	and it's not the first.
2008-07-12T01:26:00.000Z	xtknight	Stormx2	o thought he got to taht point
