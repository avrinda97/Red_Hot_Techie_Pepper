2009-08-06T14:57:00.000Z	simion314		hi, how can i create a shortcvut to a folder (synlink). i want to link Documents in home to other folder , so if i save something in Documents it is saved in the new location, i read about symlinks but the examples are using mainly files not folders
2009-08-06T14:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	simion314	easy, move the folder to the new location, then run:   ln -s /path/to/new/location ~/linkname
2009-08-06T14:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	simion314	the link will mean when you save stuff to the link it will actually be saved in the new position
2011-02-11T14:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	simion314	can you use http://pastie.org and give the output of:  uname -a; lsb_release -a; echo; dpkg -l | grep flash; dpkg -l | grep gnash; dpkg -l | grep swf        thanks

2011-02-11T14:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	simion314	sudo apt-get --purge remove flashplugin-installer flashplugin-nonfree; sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree     then close all browsers and re-open should be ok
2011-02-11T14:19:00.000Z	simion314	ActionParsnip	thx, it worked
2011-11-11T16:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	simion314	could use nmap and scan the interface
2011-11-11T16:23:00.000Z	simion314	ActionParsnip	what should i scan with nmap the router IP?
2011-11-11T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	simion314	that isn't a full question
2011-11-11T16:25:00.000Z	simion314	ActionParsnip	i installed nmap ,looked at man and i see an example nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org  , my question is how to use it for my case? see the router open ports
2011-11-11T16:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	simion314	if you scan the router for open ports you can see what is open and closed
2011-11-11T16:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	simion314	use your routers WAN IP
2011-12-12T16:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	simion314	does the system have a make and model?
2011-12-12T16:36:00.000Z	simion314	ActionParsnip	this is my motherboard ASUS M4A88T-M/USB3  i can give more details about the hardware if needed
2011-12-12T16:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	simion314	if you run:  alsamixer   are all the levels unmuted and cranked?
2011-12-12T16:38:00.000Z	simion314	ActionParsnip	yes
2011-12-12T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	simion314	can you give the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh; chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh; ./alsa-info.sh
2011-12-12T16:39:00.000Z	simion314	ActionParsnip	the "Headphone" in alsamixer is grayedout/disabled

2011-12-12T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	simion314	keep hold of that, its dead useful. My sound troubleshooting isn't great
