2009-12-02T03:19:00.000Z	pspfreak		Hey guys. Is there a reason that flash is extremly slow?
2009-12-02T03:20:00.000Z	pspfreak		I have a 768MB Ram, 2.5GHZ, and 8MB video
2009-12-02T03:20:00.000Z	pspfreak		32 bit
2009-12-02T03:20:00.000Z	pspfreak		i got it from package manager
2009-12-02T03:20:00.000Z	pspfreak		no, i mean in the browser like firefox
2009-12-02T03:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	Flash in Firefox in Ubuntu can =  right issues,  but if you do it in another browser such as  Epiphany or Galeon you will probably find it works well.  sudo apt-get install epiphany-browser if you do just epiphany it will put on a game
2009-12-02T03:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	there's also Gnash and Swfdec as Flash alternatives
2009-12-02T03:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	There is no Safari for  Desktop Linux, however the rendering endgine for Safari Webkit  is based on KHTML  what Konqueror uses
2009-12-02T03:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	engine above
2009-12-02T03:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	ok np
2009-12-02T03:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	The bot didn't mention it, but you could also run Chromeium  which  Google Chrome is based on.
2009-12-02T03:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	and there's also Chrome for Desktop Linux
2009-12-02T03:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	Chromeium being open source :)   Google Chrome not being
2009-12-02T03:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	both similar
2009-12-02T03:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	Off topic really, but  I personally think it would be better for most web users to  be using Firefox most of the time :)  since it is the most used after that horrible default browser on Windows, I think you know the one I mean.  well IE8 is an improvement they say.   If enough web users use a decant browser, the web would improve a lot.
2009-12-19T08:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	http://releases.ubuntu.com/9.04  and I suggest md5sum/sha1suming or both your ISO before burning the contents to CD as well
2009-12-19T08:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	well 10.04 comes out at the end of April
2010-09-17T02:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	 9.04 is one of the best releases, it will run out of support at the end of next month,  10.10 final will come out on Sunday the 10th next month, and well if that won't work on your computer,  I expect some other distro would,  and probably not really a good idea for you to get 10.10 just yet
2010-09-17T02:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	if you want to get it a bit early, I would suggest the release candidate thats 30th September
2010-09-17T02:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	9.04 is awesome (except for a tiny little feature that I didn't like)
2010-09-17T02:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	Why don;'t you want to be on 9.04?
2010-09-17T02:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pspfreak	9.04 is one of the best versions of Ubuntu
