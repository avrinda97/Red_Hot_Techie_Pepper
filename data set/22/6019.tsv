2008-09-25T14:37:00.000Z	ja1		Hi! I just installed kubuntu. I need to recompile the kernel. Im unfamiliar with debian systems. Do I just get the latest kernel, unpack, make config   like I did in Red hat?
2008-09-25T14:38:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ja1	Is there a particular reason for rebuilding the kernel?
2008-09-25T14:39:00.000Z	ja1	IntuitiveNipple	Problems with the KDE4 graphics + tuning.
2008-09-25T14:41:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ja1	If you really need to edit the kernel then download the kernel-source and modify the package. apt-get source linux-source
2008-09-25T14:41:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ja1	or, even, sudo apt-get install linux-source
2008-09-25T14:42:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ja1	is it an mt adapter?
2008-09-25T14:42:00.000Z	ja1	IntuitiveNipple	mt sounds familiar.
2008-09-25T14:43:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ja1	maybe this?  Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0711:0230 Magic Control Technology Corp. MCT-232 Serial Port
2008-09-25T14:44:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ja1	the module for the MCT is mct_u232
2008-09-25T14:44:00.000Z	ja1	IntuitiveNipple	Yes, thats a MCT-232
2008-09-25T14:45:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ja1	If you want to hack the Ubuntu kernel, see this for starters: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelMaintenance
2008-09-25T14:46:00.000Z	ja1	IntuitiveNipple	Thanks.
2008-09-25T14:48:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ja1	No... that'll be just a matter of configuring the correct module for the hardware, using /etc/modprobe.d/options (when you've found the correct options of course!)
2008-09-25T14:49:00.000Z	ja1	IntuitiveNipple	Finding the options will take some research...
2008-09-25T14:49:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ja1	And your point is...? *grin*
2008-09-25T14:49:00.000Z	ja1	IntuitiveNipple	Hehe, *I got puppy eyes*
2008-09-25T14:50:00.000Z	ja1	IntuitiveNipple	I try to sort it myself, np.
2008-09-25T14:54:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ja1	Ubuntu is modular, if you want to know the exact kernel config look in /boot/config*  files - those are the options each kernel version used when building
2008-09-25T14:55:00.000Z	ja1	IntuitiveNipple	Ah, thats why I didnt find /proc/config.gz, they have changed it.
2008-09-25T14:58:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ja1	You should know the Linux world, you have to bring along your own motivation :)
2008-09-25T14:59:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ja1	Ikonia has had experience of people out of their depth then asking for help, and causing headaches for the people here that are willing to try and help, to the frustration of all concerned
2008-09-25T15:03:00.000Z	ja1	IntuitiveNipple	ikonia: I will repay your help by learning and helping others. So I guess I go recompile my kernel, loose the support, then come back to give support. (Probably I'll be back trying to get support inbetween :) Its faster to ask and get some directions than to have to try everything on your own. Keep the motivation up!
