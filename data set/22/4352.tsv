2010-05-14T23:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Mandriva always goes down smooth
2010-05-14T23:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Sealwithakiss: run: sudo lshw -C sound ,use the product line to find guides
2010-05-14T23:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Sealedwithakiss: if the system is a laptop then try: www.laptoplinux.com for guides on how to make it nice
2010-05-14T23:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Gribag: could add it to your startup items
2010-05-14T23:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Sealedwithakiss: if its branded then their may be guides for that but lshw should help as well as: lspci | grep -I audio
2010-05-14T23:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Xorwhy: lsb_release -a; uname -a
2010-05-14T23:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Gridbag: after logon. If you add the command to /etc/rc.local it will run just before gdm etc (add it above the exit. Line)
2010-05-14T23:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Kaosoft: you'd have to look at the changelogs. Why is recent important? They will chop and change newness as new releases appear
2010-05-14T23:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Isaac_: assuming the pc can boot usb ;)
2010-05-14T23:37:00.000Z	isaac_	ActionParsnip	assuming that of course, yes.
2010-05-14T23:41:00.000Z	isaac_	ActionParsnip	okay I'll ask you:  What do you do when a friend's computer is locked up with spyware and won't even boot so you can fix it?
2012-02-08T12:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isaac_	why do you not have the data backed up?
2012-02-08T12:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isaac_	as in, already backed up?
2012-02-08T12:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isaac_	But why is it not already backed up now?
2012-02-08T12:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isaac_	if your drive motor fails and the drive doesn't spin up, where is your data?
2012-02-08T12:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isaac_	if you can copy data to a USB drive, you can backup
2012-02-08T12:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isaac_	you can mount the wubi image from the ubuntu live CD.
2012-02-08T12:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isaac_	I suggest you REGULARLY backup your data, then you wouldn't have this situation.
2012-02-08T12:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isaac_	yes, you can mount the wubi disk image in liveCD, like I said..
2012-02-08T12:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isaac_	it should work if you copy over the configs
2012-02-08T12:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isaac_	you can always backup the default files and you can roll back
