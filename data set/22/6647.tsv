2006-09-01T07:43:00.000Z	Jamminpotato		if i want to set upa basic file server/bittorrenting box that would only be accessed via ssh from my main computer, what would be the best ubuntu setup for that? maybe ubuntu server+xfce or fluxbox?
2006-09-01T07:44:00.000Z	nozorro	Jamminpotato	common wisdom is not to use any graphical interface on a secure server at all
2006-09-01T07:44:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	nozorro	oh ok, i've never done the whole ssh thing before how exactly would it work?
2006-09-01T07:45:00.000Z	Jamminpotato		so jut ubuntu server then and ssh to it?
2006-09-01T07:45:00.000Z	nozorro	Jamminpotato	read up on it on the web, it's really not trivial
2006-09-01T07:45:00.000Z	nozorro		!ssh
2006-09-01T07:45:00.000Z	Jamminpotato		and then my current ocmputer will handle the windowing managing?
2006-09-01T07:46:00.000Z	nozorro	Jamminpotato	not sure what you mean, if your server has graphical interface installed, yes you can remotely use them from the local box
2006-09-01T07:46:00.000Z	nozorro	Jamminpotato	but you're better off not using any gr. interface on a public server
2006-09-01T07:47:00.000Z	nozorro	Jamminpotato	.. because of security
2006-09-01T07:47:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	nozorro	so if i use ssh to remotely login to it, then would i have to do everything by the command line?
2006-09-01T07:48:00.000Z	nozorro	Jamminpotato	yes you can remotely administer the server from command line (or using other interfaces). Linux is ideal for such things -- but like i said it's not trivial and you need to learn stuff
2006-09-01T07:49:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	nozorro	it will be on the same intranet as my main box and behidn a firewall and really only for my use and not visible to the outside, ....so would having a graphical interface be bad
2006-09-01T07:51:00.000Z	nozorro	Jamminpotato	in that case, if the firewall is tight enough, gr interface will be ok. but if your server, even being behind the firewall, is for public use, things are different. it depends a lot on concrete conditions
2006-09-01T07:52:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	nozorro	it wont be for pulbic use, well not this year, next year when im at college it will be...but that will be a next summer proejct
2006-09-01T07:52:00.000Z	Jamminpotato		right now its just for my use
2006-09-01T07:53:00.000Z	nozorro	Jamminpotato	ok in that case just install normal ubuntu (with desktop) or xubuntu on the server, plus the bittorrent server software. i can't tell you anything about the latter, though. In any case make sure the firewall is tight enough.
2006-09-01T07:54:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	nozorro	isn't there a special server ubuntu version?
2006-09-01T07:55:00.000Z	nozorro	Jamminpotato	yes but as it is common with Linux to do without graph. interface for servers, it is not included (i think) in ubuntu's server setup
2006-09-01T07:56:00.000Z	nozorro	Jamminpotato	to be frank, ubuntu server is just some kind of stripped down ubuntu if you ask me ... because there are better Linux distros for servers ... anyway it will help you to have the same distro on both server and desktop
2006-09-01T07:57:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	nozorro	thanks
2006-09-01T07:57:00.000Z	nozorro	Jamminpotato	there's a ton of documentation on the net about Linux servers, just grab it and read, read, read
