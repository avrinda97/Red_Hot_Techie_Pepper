2010-04-28T08:08:00.000Z	evilbug	un214	i'm supposed to do what with that?
2010-04-28T08:08:00.000Z	un214		is your linux system still running?
2010-04-28T08:09:00.000Z	evilbug	un214	here's something really cool. i'm using livecd to look into /etc and i see fstab right there...
2010-04-28T08:09:00.000Z	un214	evilbug	unfortunately taht /etc/fstab is for the livecd
2010-04-28T08:09:00.000Z	un214		now we get the harder job
2010-04-28T08:10:00.000Z	evilbug	un214	it says it's booted /dev/sda1 as /
2010-04-28T08:10:00.000Z	un214		what does df say?
2010-04-28T08:10:00.000Z	evilbug	un214	well i'm using an alternate disc with "fix a broken system".
2010-04-28T08:11:00.000Z	evilbug	un214	df says "/dev/sda1 mounted on /"
2010-04-28T08:11:00.000Z	evilbug	un214	so i am looking at my hdd.
2010-04-28T08:11:00.000Z	un214		ok can you see your /home?
2010-04-28T08:12:00.000Z	un214		(the contents of that is)
2010-04-28T08:12:00.000Z	evilbug	un214	indeed i can.
2010-04-28T08:13:00.000Z	un214		ok so the first line of /etc/fstab is "/dev/sda1 / ext3 relatime,errors=remount-ro 0 1
2010-04-28T08:13:00.000Z	un214		assuming your / really is ext3
2010-04-28T08:13:00.000Z	un214		file /dev/sda1 will tell you
2010-04-28T08:15:00.000Z	un214		evilbug??
2010-04-28T08:17:00.000Z	evilbug	un214	i ran "nano /etc/fstab" and it says "/ was on /dev/sda1 during installation".
2010-04-28T08:17:00.000Z	un214	evilbug	it sounds like your /etc/fstab is intact after all
2010-04-28T08:20:00.000Z	evilbug	un214	fun little issue, eh?
2010-04-28T08:21:00.000Z	un214	evilbug	I don't know sounds like your issue is elsewhere
