2011-03-05T22:13:00.000Z	dejan_		My ubuntu 10.10 is just installed and fine however when I edit text (copy cut) I spotted that whole system is freezing for very short time (1 sec) why this can be? I installed ubuntu wth no swap (0) maybe this is why or?
2011-03-05T22:13:00.000Z	dejan_		1 gb
2011-03-05T22:13:00.000Z	dejan_		I am not sure if this is happeing only in mozzila
2011-03-05T22:14:00.000Z	dejan_		what you think why this can happen?
2011-03-05T22:14:00.000Z	waxrose	dejan_	Ubuntu's default Firefox is a bit buggy anyways so that could be a reason.
2011-03-05T22:15:00.000Z	waxrose	dejan_	I am guessing that it is running on high processing.
2011-03-05T22:15:00.000Z	dejan_	waxrose	maybe its that the reason..
2011-03-05T22:16:00.000Z	waxrose	dejan_	The default Ubuntu tends to be a resource monster so some times.
2011-03-05T22:17:00.000Z	dejan_	waxrose	:  i will check in text editror ad report shortly - thanks
2011-03-05T22:17:00.000Z	waxrose	dejan_	Try using chromium-browser and seeing if you experience the same issue. If not then it's most likely firefox
2011-03-05T22:18:00.000Z	dejan_	waxrose	I will test yes and i will report
2011-03-05T22:19:00.000Z	dejan_	waxrose	btw swap is only used when whole ram is used at the moment?
2011-03-05T22:19:00.000Z	dejan_	waxrose	its ubuntu :S
2011-03-05T22:20:00.000Z	waxrose	dejan_	Yeah that is from my understanding.
2011-03-05T22:21:00.000Z	waxrose	dejan_	Go to system --> administration --> system monitor and check to see if some thing is taking up resources.
2011-03-05T22:22:00.000Z	dejan_	waxrose	no no my ram is free 800 mb
2011-03-05T22:23:00.000Z	waxrose	dejan_	ext4
2011-03-05T22:24:00.000Z	dejan_	waxrose	yes I think that, the first option that gave me..
2011-03-05T22:24:00.000Z	waxrose	dejan_	It's probably wise to always have a swap unless you have more than 4+ gigs of ram.
2011-03-05T22:24:00.000Z	dejan_	waxrose	its a matter of time when I reinstall it I had no experience with formmating
2011-03-05T22:25:00.000Z	waxrose	dejan_	You typically should stick to the default until you gain experience in formatting partitions.
2011-03-05T22:25:00.000Z	dejan_	waxrose	: what is default ? :S
