2005-06-06T08:32:00.000Z	Chicago60657		what's the command to set permissions on a directory (not a file)?
2005-06-06T08:32:00.000Z	Chicago60657		i know chmod...but chmod a+rw /mnt/win * did not work
2005-06-06T08:33:00.000Z	Chicago60657		why does ubuntu fucking lock me out of my windoze partition?
2005-06-06T08:33:00.000Z	Chicago60657		it's msdos
2005-06-06T08:33:00.000Z	Chicago60657		win 98
2005-06-06T08:33:00.000Z	pfp	Chicago60657	chmod -R a+rw /mnt/foo  <- recursive
2005-06-06T08:34:00.000Z	pfp	Chicago60657	also, chek mount options for msdos (man mount)
2005-06-06T08:34:00.000Z	Chicago60657		the fstab settings are fine
2005-06-06T08:35:00.000Z	Chicago60657		yes...i can read it fine...just won't allow me to move files fo it
2005-06-06T08:35:00.000Z	pfp		mount -t msdos -ouid=1000,gid=1000 might help
2005-06-06T08:36:00.000Z	Chicago60657		what's the basic difference between setting permission for a directory versus a file?
2005-06-06T08:37:00.000Z	Chicago60657		i can do everything under the sun as a user to my /mnt/win directory...except write...so i guess the solution is: Chicago60657: chmod -R a+rw /mnt/foo <- recursive  is that right??
2005-06-06T08:37:00.000Z	Chicago60657		sorry for the cut n paste
2005-06-06T08:38:00.000Z	Chicago60657		one more question please...how come i can't boot into gnome as root and do these permission issue that way?
2005-06-06T08:39:00.000Z	pfp	Chicago60657	does ubuntu show _you_ as owner of the files under /mnt/win?
2005-06-06T08:40:00.000Z	Chicago60657		well i can boot "recovery mode" which boots and brings me to a root prompt...but startx doesn't work and gdm just brings up the login screen...which of course, i can't log in as root.
2005-06-06T08:41:00.000Z	pfp		i think logging in to gnome as root would cause more problems than solve them :)
2005-06-06T08:41:00.000Z	Chicago60657	pfp	no i'm not the owner of the /mnt/win or it's files...i just want root to chmod my userid with write permission to the windoze hard drive...that's all!
2005-06-06T08:41:00.000Z	Chicago60657		look...i don't really give a fuck if i ruin the ubuntu installation...it's just a toy for now
2005-06-06T08:42:00.000Z	pfp	Chicago60657	you cant change the ownership of windoze files that way, because FAT doesn't know about file owners
2005-06-06T08:42:00.000Z	Chicago60657		oh...and a warning...i was playing a cd with .flac files on it...i had a small black marker smudge on the read side of the cd...when i got to the track with the ink blotch on it...it totally crashed ubuntu
2005-06-06T08:43:00.000Z	pfp	Chicago60657	thats why you have to specify uig=chicago,gid=chicago on mount options (fstab), replacing chicago w/ your userid
