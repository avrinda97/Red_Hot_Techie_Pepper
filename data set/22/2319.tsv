2009-07-18T11:42:00.000Z	Anish123		I cant boot into Ubuntu through uSB, only through CD, but I need it on a netbook, so
2009-07-18T11:42:00.000Z	Anish123		What should I do? I tried unetbootin to make it bootable, but shows the same message
2009-07-18T11:43:00.000Z	Anish123		Also, I heard that AMD 64 processors have a problem with running Jaunty
2009-07-18T11:43:00.000Z	Anish123		Jaunty
2009-07-18T11:43:00.000Z	Anish123		Yes
2009-07-18T11:43:00.000Z	Anish123		On my HD yes, but I need to get it on USB to get it onto netbook
2009-07-18T11:43:00.000Z	Anish123		Not working
2009-07-18T11:44:00.000Z	caffemisto	Anish123	the USB install is not working?
2009-07-18T11:44:00.000Z	Anish123		It shows the same message

2009-07-18T11:45:00.000Z	Anish123		I have it dual booting with Windows Vista Home Premiun 64 bit
2009-07-18T11:45:00.000Z	Anish123		And also, I have Ubuntu installed via Wubi
2009-07-18T11:45:00.000Z	caffemisto	Anish123	looks like something related to a storage device
2009-07-18T11:46:00.000Z	Anish123		Yes
2009-07-18T11:46:00.000Z	Anish123	thefrustratedopt	I need USB to make it boot on netbook - HP Mini. I need that as not a partition, but my primary OS
2009-07-18T11:47:00.000Z	caffemisto	Anish123	i would create a manual USB installation of Ubuntu with persistence
2009-07-18T11:47:00.000Z	caffemisto		on the USB key
2009-07-18T11:48:00.000Z	Anish123		OK
