2007-03-18T09:51:00.000Z	Pollywog		ndiswrapper for sound cards?
2007-03-18T09:51:00.000Z	Pollywog		I thought it was for wifi
2007-03-18T09:51:00.000Z	slavik	Pollywog	ndiswrapper si for entwork, but the idea can be applied to other drivers
2007-03-18T09:52:00.000Z	Pollywog	slavik	oic
2007-03-19T12:17:00.000Z	Pollywog	slavik	it keeps restarting or it just dies?
2007-03-19T12:21:00.000Z	Pollywog	slavik	did you check the log?
2007-03-19T12:22:00.000Z	slavik	Pollywog	which one?
2007-03-19T12:22:00.000Z	Pollywog	slavik	the log in /tmp
2007-03-19T12:23:00.000Z	slavik	Pollywog	you mean the X log in /var/log/ ?
2007-03-19T12:24:00.000Z	slavik	Pollywog	I don't see anything that resembles a log in /tmp
2007-03-19T12:25:00.000Z	Pollywog	slavik	cd to /tmp and use 'ls -l'
2007-03-19T12:28:00.000Z	slavik	Pollywog	there is .ICE-unix, .X11-unix and a .X0-lock
2007-03-19T12:28:00.000Z	Pollywog	slavik	try ~/.xsession-errors
2007-03-19T12:30:00.000Z	Pollywog	slavik	try also where Pestilence said...   in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2007-03-19T12:31:00.000Z	slavik	Pollywog	well, the old one (for the crashed session) caught sig 11
2007-03-19T12:32:00.000Z	slavik	Pollywog	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11078/
2007-03-19T12:34:00.000Z	Pollywog	slavik	I looked and I don't know why it is crashing
2007-03-19T12:35:00.000Z	slavik	Pollywog	there are problems with gnome-settings-daemon, too
2007-03-19T12:35:00.000Z	Pollywog	slavik	can you use kde without crashes?
2007-03-19T12:36:00.000Z	slavik	Pollywog	don't have kde on this system
2007-03-19T12:36:00.000Z	Pollywog	slavik	you could install something like icewm to test
2007-03-19T13:21:00.000Z	slavik	Pollywog	here's the weird thing ... my XGL session with ebryl does not crash ...
