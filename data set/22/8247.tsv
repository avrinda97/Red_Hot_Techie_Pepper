2005-09-24T11:40:00.000Z	redon2		this channel is chaotic. where are the kernel sources? (tried /usr/src)
2005-09-24T11:41:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	cd /usr/src/ and have a look if they are not there then you need to download them
2005-09-24T11:41:00.000Z	redon2	ompaul	they're not there. how can I get apt-get to fetch them?
2005-09-24T11:42:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	which kernel version are you running?
2005-09-24T11:44:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	go to system administration synaptic and then click on repositories
2005-09-24T11:44:00.000Z	redon2	ompaul	what next?
2005-09-24T11:45:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	there is a repositories button
2005-09-24T11:46:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	you need to add source
2005-09-24T11:47:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	click on settings and show hidden repos
2005-09-24T11:48:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	may be the source be with you
2005-09-24T11:51:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	click all and then on the right hand side click and start to type kernel you will find the info you need
2005-09-24T11:52:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	sorry it is, I forgot a step :-/
2005-09-24T11:53:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	tell it to reload
2005-09-24T11:54:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	several steps back - settings repositories settings
2005-09-24T11:54:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	thats hidden
2005-09-24T11:54:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	thats where hidden is
2005-09-24T11:55:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	if you can't do this then I do not think that you should be playing with the kernel you could break the machine in new and interesting ways
2005-09-24T12:09:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	for fun /msg ubotu sources and restricted that should keep you busy for ohh 5 minutes :)
2005-09-24T12:14:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	get some messages from ubotu?
2005-09-24T12:27:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	apt-get install build-essential you will want that for your compiler - remember this distro was not designed for the power user :)
2005-09-24T12:28:00.000Z	ompaul	redon2	but many many of them use it :-) ease of use
