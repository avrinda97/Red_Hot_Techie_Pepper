2012-01-08T13:31:00.000Z	mybox1776		I was wondering, for someone who wants to start from scratch learning UNBUNTU/Linux in general (desktop, DNS, DHCP, etc etc) what book would you recommend?  The "BIBLE" editions or the Orange "Unleashed" types?
2012-01-08T13:32:00.000Z	mybox1776		Like Ubuntu Unleashed 2011 edition?
2012-01-08T13:33:00.000Z	kcantu	mybox1776	it depends on what you mean by "from scratch"
2012-01-08T13:34:00.000Z	kcantu	mybox1776	i like the O'Reilly book, Robbins and Beebe's "Classic Shell Scripting"
2012-01-08T13:35:00.000Z	mybox1776		Im a Win Admin, and LINUX is something I want to implement. I want to scrap IIS and go w/ Apache....
2012-01-08T13:35:00.000Z	mybox1776		But, I want to learn Linux in general - if it all there i a book that can cover basic to advanced....
2012-01-08T13:36:00.000Z	mybox1776		these unleashed books look pretty good, but... O'Reilley looks advanced off the get go
2012-01-08T13:36:00.000Z	mybox1776		am I wrong?
2012-01-08T13:36:00.000Z	kcantu	mybox1776	then definitely you'll benefit from picking up more fluency with the shell, but probably want some more things to read, as well
2012-01-08T13:38:00.000Z	mybox1776		While I am here, can I ask a question about possible spawning processes that don't go away in the latest version I am runningn now?  For example, when running 'htop' I am seeing sooooooo many processes that are just sitting there doing nothing but taking up memory... and like, when I open chromium up, there are literally 30-30 PIDS
2012-01-08T13:39:00.000Z	kcantu	mybox1776	I am really curious about Michael Kerrisk's book, "The Linux Programming Interface" (this guy maintains the Linux manpages) http://man7.org/tlpi/index.html
2012-01-08T13:40:00.000Z	mybox1776		and whenever I go to a site w/ flash (youtube) the CPU cranks at 100% and when I close the browser the  .bin file forgot what it is) stays at 100%
2012-01-08T13:40:00.000Z	mybox1776		I know, but I literrally only have one tab open...  google mail...  and If I do have more then close out of them, they remain...  memory goes way down.   I have fast sony laptop w/ 4GB ram...
2012-01-08T13:40:00.000Z	mybox1776		I have like 520MB mem left avail.
2012-01-08T13:41:00.000Z	kcantu	mybox1776	Flash is a hideous wart
2012-01-08T13:41:00.000Z	mybox1776		tell me this anyone...   Ihave 67 of  /usr/sbin/console-kit-daemon --no daemon processes open
2012-01-08T13:41:00.000Z	kcantu	mybox1776	there are like a zillion tiny little background programs running that are never a problem, though (especially with Linux with a GUI running)
2012-01-08T13:42:00.000Z	mybox1776		no fresh install
2012-01-08T13:42:00.000Z	kcantu	mybox1776	FreeBSD/NetBSD people tell me BSD is wonderful because you don't see the clutter of so many programs running on a base system
2012-01-08T13:42:00.000Z	mybox1776		I apt'ed chromium-browser
2012-01-08T13:42:00.000Z	mybox1776	kcantu	can I send you a screencap?/
2012-01-08T13:43:00.000Z	kcantu	mybox1776	sure, but i bet the only problem is that Flash is a horrible piece of bloatware
