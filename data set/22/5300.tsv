2008-11-12T10:21:00.000Z	DasEi		﻿ fryguy: install alsamixer
2008-11-12T10:21:00.000Z	fryguy	DasEi	alsamixer is installed, as i mentioned, playing with the volume controls for master, pcm, and the other mixers has no effect (except muting and unmuting the internal speaker)
2008-11-12T10:23:00.000Z	fryguy	DasEi	yes, shows up correctly.  Like i said, sound comes out, just out of the internal speaker, and only full volume (or none at all)
2008-11-12T10:23:00.000Z	fryguy	DasEi	shows up just the same as it did in previous versions of ubuntu
2008-11-12T10:24:00.000Z	fryguy	DasEi	there's nothing in syslog related to audio problems
2008-11-12T10:24:00.000Z	fryguy	DasEi	there's nothing in any logs related to audio problems
2008-11-12T10:27:00.000Z	fryguy	DasEi	the correct driver is loaded, it's the same driver as was used in 8.04
2008-11-12T10:29:00.000Z	fryguy	DasEi	i'm not running gnome anymore, what is the command to bring up that dialog
2008-11-12T10:29:00.000Z	fryguy	DasEi	i'm not running kde
2008-11-12T10:29:00.000Z	fryguy	DasEi	as I asked, what is the command to bring up that dialog
2008-11-12T10:31:00.000Z	fryguy	DasEi	surface?
2008-11-12T10:32:00.000Z	fryguy	DasEi	i'm not running either of those
2008-11-12T10:32:00.000Z	fryguy	DasEi	I don't run a desktop environment
2008-11-12T10:33:00.000Z	fryguy	DasEi	I'm not running headless.
2008-11-12T10:33:00.000Z	fryguy	DasEi	I found the name of the command you are referring to.  I've changed things in here before, with no effect
2008-11-12T10:34:00.000Z	fryguy	DasEi	what?
