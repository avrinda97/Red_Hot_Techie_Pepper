2009-01-06T08:57:00.000Z	hellhound_		is there a way to set mouse buttons to move back, up and forward in nautilus?
2009-01-06T08:59:00.000Z	jrib	hellhound_	bind your keys using xbindkeys or imwheel
2009-01-06T09:01:00.000Z	hellhound_	jrib	 xbindkeys works for firefox and i have imwheel setup and configured using the button assignment i found through xev but it made no change in nautilus i used this site as a guide http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2006/12/02/imwheel-5-button-mouse-within-nautilus-ubuntu-610/
2009-01-06T09:03:00.000Z	jrib	hellhound_	the keyboard shortcuts for nautilus are the same for firefox and nautilus to go back and forward, so if it works in one, it has to work in the other
2009-01-06T09:04:00.000Z	jrib	hellhound_	it really doesn't make sense to use both xbindkeys and imwheel afaics
2009-01-06T09:04:00.000Z	jrib	hellhound_	at least not for binding the same key
2009-01-06T09:05:00.000Z	hellhound_	jrib	 that is what i thought but i could not think of anything else.  i know the shortcuts for firefox and nautilus are the same but trust me for some reason i have it working in firefox but not in nautilus
2009-01-06T09:06:00.000Z	jrib	hellhound_	ps -ef | egrep 'imwheel|xbindkey'
2009-01-06T09:08:00.000Z	hellhound_	jrib	 i get "1000     30696  30534     0  20:07 pts/0     00:00:00 egrep imwheel|xbindkey
2009-01-06T09:08:00.000Z	jrib	hellhound_	so neither imwheel nor xbindkeys is running?
2009-01-06T09:10:00.000Z	hellhound_	jrib	is that what is going on?  now that i look it seems that i am actually setting up firefox mouse button functionality through Xmodmap
2009-01-06T09:10:00.000Z	jrib	hellhound_	I doubt you need to use xmodmap
2009-01-06T09:11:00.000Z	hellhound_	jrib	 i do NEED that for my Logitech G15 keyboard
2009-01-06T09:11:00.000Z	jrib	hellhound_	aren't we talking about your mouse?
2009-01-06T09:12:00.000Z	hellhound_	jrib	 i guess i could get rid of pointer line and then have xbindkeys run for the mouse
2009-01-06T09:12:00.000Z	jrib	hellhound_	what is your pointer line doing?\
2009-01-06T09:13:00.000Z	hellhound_	jrib	 "pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 8 9 6 7"  i remember now that I used this line for the back and forward to work with my tilt action on the wheel and it works like a charm.... but not for nautilus
2009-01-06T09:14:00.000Z	jrib	hellhound_	did you make sure you still need it after upgrading to 8.10?
2009-01-06T09:15:00.000Z	hellhound_	jrib	 yes in fact i had to change it for 8.10... my mouse will work without it but not the tilt function and after a long time searching i found that as a resolution
2009-01-06T09:15:00.000Z	jrib	hellhound_	k, then just setup xbindkeys or imwheel now
2009-01-06T09:16:00.000Z	hellhound_	jrib	 so i should remove the pointer line in the xmodmap?
2009-01-06T09:16:00.000Z	jrib	hellhound_	nah, you can leave that
