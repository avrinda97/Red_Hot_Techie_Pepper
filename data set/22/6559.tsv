2006-11-05T16:24:00.000Z	trogdoor	kamui	No output, or did it say "0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded." ?
2006-11-05T16:24:00.000Z	kamui	trogdoor	0 newly installed, 0 to remove, 6 not upgraded
2006-11-05T16:25:00.000Z	trogdoor	kamui	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-11-05T16:26:00.000Z	kamui	trogdoor	some index files failed to download, they have been ignored or old ones used instead.
2006-11-05T16:26:00.000Z	trogdoor	kamui	Are you connected to the internet?
2006-11-05T16:27:00.000Z	kamui	trogdoor	yes, Im on the laptop im trying to upgrade typing to you now
2006-11-05T16:29:00.000Z	trogdoor	kamui	Strange, try: sudo apt-get update again just to be sure, if it doesn't work pastebin the output.
2006-11-05T16:32:00.000Z	kamui	trogdoor	I can't pastebin, is there a way I can pipe the content to a text file to send?  >> output.txt doesn't get everything
2006-11-05T16:32:00.000Z	kamui	trogdoor	I've got no X and no console mouse support
2006-11-05T16:33:00.000Z	trogdoor	kamui	Does it mention 404 anywhere?
2006-11-05T16:34:00.000Z	kamui	trogdoor	no, it seems to be saying that the packages are not in gzip format
2006-11-05T16:35:00.000Z	kamui	trogdoor	sub process gzip returned error code (1)
2006-11-05T16:35:00.000Z	trogdoor	kamui	A lot of people have been having that problem today.
2006-11-05T16:36:00.000Z	kamui	trogdoor	so, should I wait? keep trying? or just reinstall Dapper Drake?
2006-11-05T16:36:00.000Z	trogdoor	kamui	On what repositories is it having a problem?
2006-11-05T16:36:00.000Z	trogdoor	kamui	you can try: sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update.
2006-11-05T16:37:00.000Z	kamui	trogdoor	http://us.archive.ubuntu.com edgy/universe packages
2006-11-05T16:37:00.000Z	trogdoor	kamui	I would keep trying.
2006-11-05T16:40:00.000Z	trogdoor	kamui	does: sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update  do anything different?
