2009-02-24T02:43:00.000Z	pjsturgeon		so cant do step 1 lol
2009-02-24T02:45:00.000Z	oCean_	pjsturgeon	/var/run/mysqld is where the pid (and sock) file probably is
2009-02-24T02:50:00.000Z	oCean_	pjsturgeon	/var/run/mysqld is where the pid file for mysql should be
2009-02-24T02:50:00.000Z	pjsturgeon	oCean_	yea the host-name was throwing me, the file is just mysqld.pid
2009-02-24T02:51:00.000Z	oCean_	pjsturgeon	why would you kill what?
2009-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	pjsturgeon	oCean_	well step 1 of this mad guide is to kill mysql process. I can do that easily with kill -9 but this kill command its telling me to use does not work at all
2009-02-24T02:54:00.000Z	oCean_	pjsturgeon	I'm not sure what guide you are following, and to what reason. I have not seen/read you problem, but I would say /etc/init.d/mysqld stop is the proper command
2009-02-24T02:54:00.000Z	oCean_	pjsturgeon	"pidof mysqld" will also return the mysqld pid
2009-02-24T02:57:00.000Z	oCean_	pjsturgeon	setting mysql root pw is easy. Or did you forget the initial root pw ??
2009-02-24T02:57:00.000Z	pjsturgeon	oCean_	http://pastie.org/397842
2009-02-24T02:58:00.000Z	oCean_	pjsturgeon	is this your first login in the mysql server?
2009-02-24T02:59:00.000Z	pjsturgeon	oCean_	i have logged into the ubuntu server many times but never got into mysql
2009-02-24T02:59:00.000Z	oCean_	pjsturgeon	the mysql password for the root user is not necessarily the same as your own pw, which you enter using sudo
2009-02-24T02:59:00.000Z	oCean_	pjsturgeon	when installing mysql (through apt-get) you are asked (during install) for a password to set
2009-02-24T02:59:00.000Z	pjsturgeon	oCean_	yea it will be different to my user pass
2009-02-24T03:00:00.000Z	oCean_	pjsturgeon	since this is your first login in the mysql server, there is probably no rootpw setup right now
2009-02-24T03:00:00.000Z	oCean_	pjsturgeon	login using "mysql -u root" (nothing else, just that)
2009-02-24T03:00:00.000Z	pjsturgeon	oCean_	thts what i thought, i've been trying to find the command but all i can find is badly written guides
2009-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	oCean_	pjsturgeon	using password yes? That implies that you gave the -p option.
2009-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	oCean_	pjsturgeon	"mysql -u root" should give "using password no"
2009-02-24T03:05:00.000Z	pjsturgeon	oCean_	ahh great after all that (im in!) its not in here anyway. sodding jinzora bollocks!
2009-02-24T03:05:00.000Z	oCean_	pjsturgeon	errr, yes. There also might be a .my.cnf configfile in your homedirectory, which overrides things. Hmmm...
