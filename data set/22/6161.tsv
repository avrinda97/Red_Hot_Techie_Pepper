2007-05-23T07:06:00.000Z	Pelo	Henning	 you probably just need to edit your xorg.conf file to add the widescreen resolutions
2007-05-23T07:07:00.000Z	Pelo	Henning	  gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf     if you are on kubuntu replace gedit with kate
2007-05-23T07:11:00.000Z	Henning	Pelo	I have xorg.conf open, now what?
2007-05-23T07:12:00.000Z	Pelo	Henning	 scroll down to the screen resolutions and I'm pretty sure you'll figure out what you need to do
2007-05-23T07:13:00.000Z	Henning	Pelo	there's loads of stuff here, always starting with "depth", then a number, then the modes
2007-05-23T07:15:00.000Z	Henning	Pelo	there's loads of stuff here in xorg.conf, always starting with "depth", then a number, then the modes
2007-05-23T07:16:00.000Z	Henning	Pelo	my graphics card apparently is a "S3 Inc. VT8375 [ProSavage8 KM266/KL266] "
2007-05-23T07:17:00.000Z	Pelo	Henning	  you need to add the resolution you need to the list of resolutions
2007-05-23T07:17:00.000Z	Pelo	Henning	 it is further down in the file,  it lists all the resolutions you can use ,
2007-05-23T07:18:00.000Z	Henning	Pelo	i know, i found the list, but there are lots of "sublists"
2007-05-23T07:19:00.000Z	Pelo	Henning	 add the rez you need to each sublist and each colour depth
2007-05-23T07:19:00.000Z	Henning	Pelo	ok thanks
