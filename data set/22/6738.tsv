2006-12-07T17:44:00.000Z	ITSa341		Anyone got any advice on an EVDO ( cellular ) card for use in Ubuntu? I don't want to sign up for two years and buy a $100 card and find it won't work right.
2006-12-07T17:45:00.000Z	ITSa341		Has anyone here even tried cellular internet access with an Ubuntu laptop?
