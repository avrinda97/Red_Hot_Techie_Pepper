2010-03-23T15:26:00.000Z	vixus		what does the yellow spiky icon with an exclamation mark in the systray mean?
2010-03-23T15:26:00.000Z	vixus		it appeared during a freeze
2010-03-23T15:26:00.000Z	vixus		so yep
2010-03-23T15:27:00.000Z	vixus		couldn't click it :)
2010-03-23T15:27:00.000Z	vixus		but what kind of crash? kernel?
2010-03-23T15:27:00.000Z	elky	vixus	right-click?
2010-03-23T15:27:00.000Z	vixus		everything froze! no mouse movement or anything
2010-03-23T15:27:00.000Z	elky	vixus	ah, everything is still stuck?
2010-03-23T15:28:00.000Z	vixus	elky	yeah this is related to my `motherboard adventures' :D
2010-03-23T15:29:00.000Z	elky	vixus	if it's all still stuck, then it's a hard lock and is likely a kernel crash, yes.
2010-03-23T15:30:00.000Z	vixus	elky	hmm, happened when the installer partitioner was loading.. any idea what this could mean?
2010-03-23T15:31:00.000Z	elky	vixus	I really couldn't say, but if you have some funky partition types then it could be that, otherwise i'm at a loss.
2010-03-23T15:31:00.000Z	vixus		oh well..
2010-03-23T15:31:00.000Z	elky	vixus	if it's a live system you won't get the logs either
2010-03-23T15:32:00.000Z	vixus		nope :(
2010-03-23T15:32:00.000Z	vixus	elky	it also screwed up the liveCD menu when i rebooted
2010-03-23T15:32:00.000Z	elky	vixus	all i can suggest if it happens continually is to have a terminal window open tailing the logs while the installer progresses
2010-03-23T15:32:00.000Z	vixus	elky	how do I do that?
2010-03-23T15:33:00.000Z	elky	vixus	tail -f /var/log/messages
2010-03-23T15:33:00.000Z	vixus		ok thanks
2010-03-23T15:34:00.000Z	vixus		so messages is the log to go with?
2010-03-23T15:35:00.000Z	elky	vixus	it's less busy than syslog, but you can do syslog if you'd prefer
