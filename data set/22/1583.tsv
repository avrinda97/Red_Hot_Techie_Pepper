2010-08-04T03:40:00.000Z	tripelb		this goes buy so fast, pidgin, can I make the typeface smaller?
2010-08-04T03:40:00.000Z	red2kic	tripelb	Change your font size? (Maybe under Appearances)
2010-08-04T03:42:00.000Z	tripelb	red2kic	I cant find it. I looked everywhere inc under Preferences. That's why I want a terminal command IRC but noe seems to come installed.
2010-08-04T03:42:00.000Z	red2kic	tripelb	Right-click -- Change Desktop Backgrounds --> Fonts?
2010-08-04T03:43:00.000Z	red2kic	tripelb	On the desktop.
2011-01-24T13:12:00.000Z	red2kic	tripelb	devede-3.16.9-2 can convert AVI to DVD.
2011-01-24T13:16:00.000Z	tripelb	red2kic	am googling devede-3.16.9-2
2011-01-24T13:33:00.000Z	red2kic	tripelb	Devede does not do the job?
2011-01-24T13:33:00.000Z	tripelb	red2kic	I am just trying to install devede to make the avi file into a dvd. will it also copy a dvd to the hard drive?
2011-01-24T13:34:00.000Z	tripelb	red2kic	can I put more than one avi file on the dvd?
2011-01-24T13:35:00.000Z	red2kic	tripelb	dvdbackup can back up the dvd to the hard drive. If you wish to convert it to something smaller, check out handbrake or ogmrip. That's just for starters.
2011-01-24T13:35:00.000Z	tripelb	red2kic	when I tried to download devede from the webpage I got a message that there is n older version in a repository and that would be better supported. Should I install the deb from the webpage or go look for the older version.
2011-01-24T13:35:00.000Z	tripelb	red2kic	I go look for dvd backup
2011-01-24T13:36:00.000Z	red2kic	tripelb	I don't regularly use devede but I remember putting many avi as i can on one single dvd for my brother or such. So I know it can deal with many avis. As for older or newer version, it's your call. What works for me in the past can work for you presently. Check ppa or getdeb if you want newer version,.
2011-01-24T13:37:00.000Z	red2kic	tripelb	dvdbackup is commandline. I know brasero can do the job of 1-on-1 copy.
2011-01-24T13:39:00.000Z	tripelb	red2kic	I have copied all of your good advice into a notes file and will continue to follow it up tomorrow. Thank you so much.
2011-01-24T13:40:00.000Z	red2kic	tripelb	No problem. With dvdbackup, you're able to write a script that automagically do stuffs + notify ; convert if necessary. ;)
2011-03-23T00:59:00.000Z	red2kic	tripelb	10-15 minutes.
2011-05-04T12:18:00.000Z	red2kic	tripelb	hardinfo is a nice GUI tool.
2011-05-04T12:23:00.000Z	red2kic	tripelb	Check out hardinfo -- it can generate a report too.
2011-05-04T12:24:00.000Z	tripelb	red2kic	I will
2011-05-06T13:43:00.000Z	red2kic	tripelb	Link? :)
