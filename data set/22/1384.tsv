2010-12-23T20:00:00.000Z	linuxcrazy		I want to install a kodak scanner in ubuntu. How can I do it?
2010-12-23T20:00:00.000Z	dr4c4n	linuxcrazy	gscan2pdf
2010-12-23T20:02:00.000Z	linuxcrazy	dr4c4n	How could I know that it works?
2010-12-23T20:02:00.000Z	dr4c4n	linuxcrazy	I was surprised at the ability of that software to find and install the driver for different scanners :) Hope it works for you, you know how to install with apt-get right?
2010-12-23T20:02:00.000Z	linuxcrazy	dr4c4n	Yes, no problem
2010-12-23T20:02:00.000Z	dr4c4n	linuxcrazy	just try it out :) it has a good set of drivers to search for automatically
2010-12-23T20:03:00.000Z	dr4c4n	linuxcrazy	for example, my parents have a printer / scanner combo from hp, and I plugged it in the other day and gscan2pdf found it automatically and was up and running within a minute or two
2010-12-23T20:03:00.000Z	linuxcrazy	dr4c4n	thats great
2010-12-23T20:03:00.000Z	dr4c4n	linuxcrazy	it also saves to pdf, jpg, png and tiff formats, and will export any image u scan directly to gimp for manipulation
2010-12-23T20:05:00.000Z	dr4c4n	linuxcrazy	now all those ppl that really like to mess around with pdfs and images need to collaborate on a really good pdf editing program.. currently the options for open source do not allow insertion of images.. pdftk is the best for ripping different pdfs apart and stitching them back together. :)
2010-12-23T20:07:00.000Z	linuxcrazy	dr4c4n	didn't work! :(
2010-12-23T20:07:00.000Z	dr4c4n	linuxcrazy	what's ur model of scanner?
2010-12-23T20:07:00.000Z	linuxcrazy	dr4c4n	kodak i1120
2010-12-23T20:07:00.000Z	dr4c4n	linuxcrazy	1 moment, while I look to see if I can help u
2010-12-23T20:08:00.000Z	linuxcrazy	dr4c4n	OK
2010-12-23T20:12:00.000Z	dr4c4n	linuxcrazy	it appears there's no linux driver for your scanner, however, after a preliminary search
2010-12-23T20:12:00.000Z	dr4c4n	linuxcrazy	I was thinking you might be able to use the software that came with the scanner through wine :)
2010-12-23T20:13:00.000Z	linuxcrazy	dr4c4n	I did that
2010-12-23T20:13:00.000Z	linuxcrazy	dr4c4n	didn't work too
2010-12-23T20:14:00.000Z	linuxcrazy	dr4c4n	Tha only thing that worked was vuescan
2010-12-23T20:14:00.000Z	linuxcrazy	dr4c4n	and its paid
2010-12-23T20:14:00.000Z	dr4c4n	linuxcrazy	 ok good luck
