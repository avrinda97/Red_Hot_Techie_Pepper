2010-12-30T23:37:00.000Z	abhijeet		hi guys
2010-12-30T23:38:00.000Z	abhijeet		my splash screen got messed up after installing the Ati graphics drivers
2010-12-30T23:38:00.000Z	abhijeet		is there any soln for it to get it back
2010-12-30T23:38:00.000Z	abhijeet		without removing the drivers
2010-12-30T23:38:00.000Z	nit-wit	abhijeet	do you get the grub menu
2010-12-30T23:40:00.000Z	abhijeet	nit-wit	yeah.. now the progress buttons looks like small squares
2010-12-30T23:41:00.000Z	nit-wit	abhijeet	if you get the grub menu you can hit e and add nomodeset righ before the quiet splash in the kernel line, this gives you a low graphics mode
2010-12-30T23:41:00.000Z	abhijeet	nit-wit	will that resolve the issue
2010-12-30T23:41:00.000Z	nit-wit	abhijeet	you just ctrl+x to boot from the edit
2010-12-30T23:42:00.000Z	nit-wit	abhijeet	it may get you in in a low graphics to fix the problem
2010-12-30T23:42:00.000Z	abhijeet	nit-wit	if it got resolved then how can i make it permanent
2010-12-30T23:43:00.000Z	nit-wit	abhijeet	you added a graphics driver that messed up your splash, correct
2010-12-30T23:43:00.000Z	abhijeet	nit-wit	yes
2010-12-30T23:44:00.000Z	nit-wit	abhijeet	all this does is get you into a session in low graphics, was the generic driver working?
2010-12-30T23:44:00.000Z	abhijeet	nit-wit	generic driver is working but my system is getting hot and fans are running fast...
2010-12-30T23:45:00.000Z	nit-wit	abhijeet	not sure how a graphics driver would change that
2010-12-30T23:46:00.000Z	nit-wit	abhijeet	you added a ppa
2010-12-30T23:47:00.000Z	abhijeet	nit-wit	ppa of what??
2010-12-30T23:47:00.000Z	nit-wit	abhijeet	did you?
2010-12-30T23:47:00.000Z	abhijeet	nit-wit	there are lot of pps repos are there in my sources.list file
2010-12-30T23:47:00.000Z	nit-wit	abhijeet	did you add one like the xcrack drivers one
2010-12-30T23:48:00.000Z	abhijeet	nit-wit	i d't think so..
