2009-12-07T00:01:00.000Z	\\`oot		Hello?  How can I make sure my kernel is set up for HDMI-delivered audio?
2009-12-07T00:02:00.000Z	\\`oot		crap
2009-12-07T00:02:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	\\`oot	Every system's sound configuration are different. You might want to search for your hardware specs and see if it turned up. For my HTPC, I had to create a configuration file and leave it in ~ for it to work.
2009-12-07T00:02:00.000Z	\\`oot		aplay -l shows only "analog" ... so the system apprears not to see the digital HDMI port at all?
2009-12-07T00:03:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	\\`oot	Is it even toggled on in BIOS?
2009-12-07T00:03:00.000Z	\\`oot	leaf-sheep	yes ... and sad to say "it works in Win7" (since I dual-boot)
2009-12-07T00:04:00.000Z	\\`oot		I'm trying to dump the non-Ubuntu partition and this little glitch is holding me back
2009-12-07T00:04:00.000Z	leaf-sheep		!lnw | \\`oot :)
2009-12-07T00:04:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	\\`oot	What hardware?
2009-12-07T00:04:00.000Z	\\`oot		Compaq 8510w
2009-12-07T00:04:00.000Z	\\`oot	leaf-sheep	Compaq 8510w laptop
2009-12-07T00:05:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	\\`oot	Clean Karmic Installation or Upgrading?
2009-12-07T00:05:00.000Z	\\`oot	leaf-sheep	Clean ...
2009-12-07T00:05:00.000Z	\\`oot	leaf-sheep	output of "aplay -l" --> card 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: AD198x Analog [AD198x Analog]
2009-12-07T00:06:00.000Z	\\`oot		I've found a TON about the AD198x hardware ... but everyone seems to have it auto-detected as Analog & digital
2009-12-07T00:06:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	\\`oot	How about "sudo lshw -c sound" ?
2009-12-07T00:06:00.000Z	\\`oot	leaf-sheep	hold on, I'll paste-bin it, one sec
2009-12-07T00:07:00.000Z	\\`oot	leaf-sheep	http://pastebin.com/m1154b80
2009-12-07T00:10:00.000Z	\\`oot	leaf-sheep	Any thoughts?  I mean ... Ubuntu recognizes audio, and I get normal fine audio ... just not over HDMI
2009-12-07T00:11:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	\\`oot	Sorry. I have to go.  My brother wanted to go to ShopKo with me (because I have large vehicle that can haul furntiures).
2009-12-07T00:11:00.000Z	\\`oot	leaf-sheep	thanks anyway
2009-12-07T00:11:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	\\`oot	Stick around. Ask. Maybe I'll be back.
