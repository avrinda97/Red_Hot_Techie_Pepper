2007-12-01T07:44:00.000Z	danbhfive	user_	you could try e2undel
2007-12-01T08:06:00.000Z	danbhfive	user_	probably not, i dont think that works
2007-12-01T08:07:00.000Z	user_	danbhfive	what is the correct one?
2007-12-01T08:08:00.000Z	danbhfive	user_	why are you backing up /home?
2007-12-01T08:09:00.000Z	user_	danbhfive	i want to backup /home/user , not /home
2007-12-01T08:09:00.000Z	user_	danbhfive	i want to re-install my ubuntu
2007-12-01T08:09:00.000Z	user_	danbhfive	upgrade it to 7.10
2007-12-01T08:09:00.000Z	user_	danbhfive	because right now i use 7.04
2007-12-01T08:12:00.000Z	danbhfive	user_	do you want to be able to restore the files?
2007-12-01T08:14:00.000Z	danbhfive	user_	 sudo rsync -aS /home/<user>/. /<backup location>/.
2007-12-01T08:24:00.000Z	danbhfive	user_	gz is just compression, for a single file, tar binds several files together
2007-12-01T08:24:00.000Z	danbhfive	user_	i think you use them both to create an archive
2007-12-01T08:24:00.000Z	danbhfive	user_	but you should use the command I have you for /home
2007-12-01T08:24:00.000Z	user_	danbhfive	so can not to gzip /var/www   is that what you mean?
2007-12-01T08:24:00.000Z	user_	danbhfive	so i must tar it first
2007-12-01T08:25:00.000Z	danbhfive	user_	i think thats the case
2007-12-01T08:25:00.000Z	user_	danbhfive	then compress it, example use gz
2007-12-01T08:25:00.000Z	user_	danbhfive	ok thanks
2007-12-01T08:25:00.000Z	danbhfive	user_	tar can gzip it for you, just add a z directive, i believe
2008-06-28T02:02:00.000Z	user_	danbhfive	yes
2008-06-28T02:04:00.000Z	danbhfive	user_	i think thats true if you are running hordy-proposed.  The module building lags behind kernel updates, but thats what proposed is for...
2008-06-28T02:05:00.000Z	user_	danbhfive	cannot follow sorry, i just installed ubuntu and have it upgraded with the update manager. no manual repo source tweaking
