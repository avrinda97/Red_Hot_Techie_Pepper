2006-12-25T10:40:00.000Z	joejaxx	tsukoharu	writes zeros to the drive
2006-12-25T10:40:00.000Z	joejaxx	tsukoharu	that is something you do not tell new users to do
2006-12-25T10:40:00.000Z	joejaxx	tsukoharu	it wipes the entire drive
2006-12-25T10:41:00.000Z	joejaxx	tsukoharu	you want to format it?
2006-12-25T10:43:00.000Z	joejaxx	tsukoharu	what is not working on ubuntu?
2006-12-25T10:44:00.000Z	joejaxx	tsukoharu	what do you mean get it to work?
2006-12-25T10:47:00.000Z	joejaxx	tsukoharu	i am really surprised that it does not come up
2006-12-25T10:47:00.000Z	joejaxx	tsukoharu	normally it is the wireless
2006-12-25T10:48:00.000Z	joejaxx	tsukoharu	i know i was just saying it was weird that it did not pick up the ethernet
2006-12-25T10:49:00.000Z	joejaxx	tsukoharu	so eth0 does not come up when you type: ifconfig?
2006-12-25T10:53:00.000Z	joejaxx	tsukoharu	then your ethernet is recognized :)
2006-12-25T10:54:00.000Z	joejaxx	tsukoharu	if your network supports dhcp
2006-12-25T10:54:00.000Z	joejaxx	tsukoharu	do : sudo dhclient eth0
