2007-12-01T07:45:00.000Z	reallyjoel		The Screen Resolution app in system->preferences (in gnome) doesnt list the correct resolutions for my screen (its widescreen), so can i set it in another way?
2007-12-01T07:45:00.000Z	danbhfive	reallyjoel	are you using an nvidia?
2007-12-01T07:46:00.000Z	reallyjoel	danbhfive	yes, 6800gt
2007-12-01T07:47:00.000Z	danbhfive	reallyjoel	the nvidia drivers have a bug which scrambles the refresh rate listings, that might be your problem
2007-12-01T07:47:00.000Z	danbhfive		anyone know how to make a suggestion for ubotu?
2007-12-01T07:48:00.000Z	reallyjoel	danbhfive	well if that bug spills over to screen resolutions, but the refresh rate works fine
2007-12-01T07:48:00.000Z	danbhfive		no, i think its just refresh rates
2007-12-01T07:48:00.000Z	reallyjoel	danbhfive	SHOULD 'Screen Resolution' app list widescreen res's?
2007-12-01T07:49:00.000Z	reallyjoel		I mean, not should as in usability, but as in how its made currently
2007-12-01T07:49:00.000Z	danbhfive	reallyjoel	are you switching monitors by chance?
2007-12-01T07:50:00.000Z	reallyjoel	danbhfive	well yeah, but i switched gpu at the same time, from ati to nvidia, required an install of nvidia drivers and a reboot
2007-12-01T07:50:00.000Z	danbhfive	reallyjoel	anyway, you can use the command sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-org
2007-12-01T07:50:00.000Z	reallyjoel		used the proprietary drivers app for that
2007-12-01T07:51:00.000Z	danbhfive	reallyjoel	yeah, you need to reconfigure every time you switch monitors
2007-12-01T07:51:00.000Z	reallyjoel	danbhfive	is it scary?
2007-12-01T07:51:00.000Z	danbhfive		i believe
2007-12-01T07:51:00.000Z	danbhfive	reallyjoel	not if you know the specs of your monitor, which it sounds like you do
2007-12-01T07:52:00.000Z	danbhfive		!spanish | ubuntu
2007-12-01T07:52:00.000Z	reallyjoel	danbhfive	It says "Package `xserver-org' is not installed..." but that sounds strange..
2007-12-01T07:53:00.000Z	danbhfive	reallyjoel	er, i don't know the package for sure, use tab complete
2007-12-01T07:53:00.000Z	danbhfive	reallyjoel	xserver-xorg ?
2007-12-01T07:54:00.000Z	reallyjoel	danbhfive	hmm?
