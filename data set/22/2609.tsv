2009-12-20T01:21:00.000Z	VCoolio	thevishy	xflux
2009-12-20T01:22:00.000Z	thevishy	VCoolio	whats xflux
2009-12-20T01:22:00.000Z	VCoolio	thevishy	http://www.stereopsis.com/flux/  download, extract, move to /usr/local/bin and run it with your latitude
2009-12-20T01:22:00.000Z	VCoolio	thevishy	at dusk it will dim your monitor, at dawn it will brighten up
2009-12-20T01:25:00.000Z	thevishy	VCoolio	will it be like default ? i only want to use this software in night when I prefer ...not all the time
2009-12-20T01:28:00.000Z	VCoolio	thevishy	it will only run when you activate it; unless you put it in startup apps
2009-12-20T01:36:00.000Z	thevishy	VCoolio	what is the formt of giving latitue ?
2009-12-20T01:37:00.000Z	VCoolio	thevishy	hang on
2009-12-20T01:37:00.000Z	VCoolio	thevishy	like this for Netherlands: xflux -l 52.05
2010-05-02T01:42:00.000Z	VCoolio	thevishy	what do you mean scarpped?
2010-05-02T01:43:00.000Z	VCoolio	thevishy	I'm using it right now, it's alive and kicking
2010-05-02T01:44:00.000Z	VCoolio	thevishy	it's awesome, using it for two years now; find the easye17.sh script and compile from svn, or use the snapshot release; that is a bit outdated, either a new snapshot or first alpha release is coming soon
2010-05-02T01:45:00.000Z	VCoolio	thevishy	yes, I have 512 ram, it's very lightweight, comparable with openbox, but much more beautiful
2010-05-02T01:45:00.000Z	thevishy	VCoolio	how about from the repos ?
2010-05-02T01:45:00.000Z	VCoolio	thevishy	that's the e17-svn package? that works, it installs the scripts and then compiles from svn
2010-05-02T01:47:00.000Z	VCoolio	thevishy	be prepared that some packages may have been removed from the svn tree, so you need to remove those from the list in the scripts (/usr/bin/easye17.sh and/or /etc/easye17.conf), than start again;
2010-05-02T01:48:00.000Z	VCoolio	thevishy	also there is some (sometimes slow) support in #e, good luck with it
2010-05-02T01:52:00.000Z	VCoolio	thevishy	yes, 9.10 had ext4 already by default
