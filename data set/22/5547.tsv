2007-04-17T05:49:00.000Z	Juanca		Hi. Anybody can help me, I'm trying to install windows to dual boot, but some problem doesn't let me, could that be some left over of ubuntu?
2007-04-17T05:49:00.000Z	Shootfast_	Juanca	- what version of ubuntu and which windows
2007-04-17T05:50:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfast_	windows xp pro, and ubuntu 6.10
2007-04-17T05:50:00.000Z	Shootfast_	Juanca	- what is installed to which drives?
2007-04-17T05:52:00.000Z	Shootfast_	Juanca	- windows only likes to be installed on the first partition, after thats done, install ubuntu to another partition and grub will do the rest
2007-04-17T05:53:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfast_	No one. I've installed ubuntu partitioning the disk in 3, but after that I thought it'll be better if I dual boot, and with Gparted, using the live CD errased the partitons, then I take out the cd and tried to install and partition with windows, but it didn't.
2007-04-17T05:55:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfast_	Before this I've made a NTFS partition left blank for Installing windows afterwards. But somebody suggested me it's better if I partitioned the disk with windows first
2007-04-17T05:56:00.000Z	Shootfast_	Juanca	- yeah, windows sometimes doesnt like the ubutnu made ntfs partitions
2007-04-17T05:56:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfast_	Ok, but now wondows doesn't run
2007-04-17T05:56:00.000Z	Shootfast_	Juanca	- boot live cd and format entire drive
2007-04-17T05:56:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfast_	how do I do that
2007-04-17T05:56:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfast_	I'm in the live cd now
2007-04-17T05:57:00.000Z	Shootfast_	Juanca	- boot from ubuntu cd, then run Gparted (its in System, Administration, Gnome Partiton editor)
2007-04-17T05:57:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfast_	I know, thats what I did before
2007-04-17T05:57:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfast_	what next?
2007-04-17T05:58:00.000Z	Shootfast_	Juanca	- what does the windows disk say when you boot from it?
2007-04-17T06:00:00.000Z	Shootfast_	Juanca	- to format entire drive - click device then setdisk lable
2007-04-17T06:00:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfast_	It start normally, but after the initial checking the screen gets black and an error message appears in a blue screen saying windows stopped to avoid damaging the disck and blal blah blah
2007-04-17T06:01:00.000Z	Juanca	Shootfast_	Ok, what do I shoose?
2007-04-17T06:01:00.000Z	Shootfast_	Juanca	- msdos
