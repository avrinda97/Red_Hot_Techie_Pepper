2010-09-18T22:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	SomethingISodd	you are sure you have the headers for the kernel installed?
2010-09-18T22:23:00.000Z	SomethingISodd	erUSUL	 no. this is a new install and i know nothing about ubuntu.
2010-09-18T22:24:00.000Z	SomethingISodd	erUSUL	 everything thats been installed has been done through apt-get or the software center.
2010-09-18T22:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	SomethingISodd	maybe we should try to remove the packages that is giving problems « sudo aptitude remove fglrx-amdcccle fglrx »
2010-09-18T22:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	SomethingISodd	install ubuntu-restricted-extras you will want that ( includes flash )
2010-09-18T22:27:00.000Z	SomethingISodd	erUSUL	 not to sound like a complete noob. but how do i do that??
2010-09-18T22:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	SomethingISodd	with the software center for instance. search for ubuntu-restriced-extras package
2010-09-18T22:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	SomethingISodd	or in cli « sudo aptitude install ubuntu-restriced-extras »
