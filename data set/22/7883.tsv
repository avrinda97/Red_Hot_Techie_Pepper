2005-12-04T08:48:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	dotheuganda	i thought you are looking for java programmers ... lol ... you can save as anything then rename or use "filename.java"
2005-12-04T08:49:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	dotheuganda	yes ... btw kate is a text editor ... i sugggest you try scite or emacs/vi
2005-12-04T08:50:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	dotheuganda	then use scite ... btw try eclipse
2005-12-04T08:52:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	dotheuganda	same way you install other things
2005-12-04T08:53:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	dotheuganda	synaptic or apt-get ... you used them before right ??
2005-12-04T08:54:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	dotheuganda	apt-get is no different from yum .. if you used fedora before
2005-12-04T08:55:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	dotheuganda	time to read a lot of stuff :P
