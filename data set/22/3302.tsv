2008-10-17T20:50:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Akhanu`	dont know through what .. thats what I need help for!
2008-10-17T20:52:00.000Z	Akhanu`	GaMbi_DK	that's very broad. When you say mp4 player, it's a different box? Does that store media files? Where from did you delete your files ?
2008-10-17T20:53:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Akhanu`	I deleted the folder from my D-drive (NTFS access for both XP and Ubuntu).. I deleted the folder by mistake when I was running Ubuntu.. iw tryed cracked version of "Get Data Back" for both D and C drive.. no luck :(
2008-10-17T20:54:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Akhanu`	Thats when I remembered that I have most of the music on my Creative Zen Vision:M 40GB media player
2008-10-17T20:54:00.000Z	Akhanu`	GaMbi_DK	OK. How do you usually upload your media files at the Zen Vision ?
2008-10-17T20:56:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Akhanu`	from XP.. but wanna be able to do it from ubuntu... you move the files like you would to a flashstick.. not like Ipod with Itool etz
2008-10-17T20:56:00.000Z	Akhanu`	GaMbi_DK	so you connect it via usb to the computer
2008-10-17T20:57:00.000Z	Akhanu`	GaMbi_DK	and when you plug it in while in ubuntu, nothing happens ?
2008-10-17T20:57:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Akhanu`	 nothing at all
2008-10-17T20:58:00.000Z	Akhanu`	GaMbi_DK	does your zen vision show up when you issue:  lsusb
2008-10-17T20:59:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Akhanu`	lsusb?
2008-10-17T20:59:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Akhanu`	 aah.. sec
2008-10-17T20:59:00.000Z	Akhanu`	GaMbi_DK	it's a command to see your usb devices
2008-10-17T21:02:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Akhanu`	nothing..
2008-10-17T21:03:00.000Z	Akhanu`	GaMbi_DK	while in windows, you haven't had the need to install additional drivers for the Zen Vision, right ?
2008-10-17T21:06:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	Akhanu`	brb <- WinXP
2008-10-17T21:06:00.000Z	Akhanu`	GaMbi_DK	ok
