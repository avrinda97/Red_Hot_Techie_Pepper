2007-08-26T07:05:00.000Z	rafaelscj	KurtKraut	ok
2007-09-17T10:47:00.000Z	KurtKraut	rafaelscj	how much RAM do you have ?
2007-09-17T10:47:00.000Z	rafaelscj	KurtKraut	512Mb
2007-09-17T10:48:00.000Z	KurtKraut	rafaelscj	I think you shouldn't care about the login manager, mainly if you intend to switch from Gnome to KDE constantly.
2007-09-17T10:49:00.000Z	KurtKraut	rafaelscj	de nada.
2007-09-17T10:49:00.000Z	rafaelscj	KurtKraut	:)
2007-09-17T11:03:00.000Z	KurtKraut	rafaelscj	yes
2007-09-17T11:05:00.000Z	rafaelscj	KurtKraut	do you know how to change the session manager? is that in /etc/init.d?
2007-09-17T11:05:00.000Z	KurtKraut	rafaelscj	no, when GDM appears, there is some sort of 'options' menu at the bottom of the screen where you can choose if you want to load XFCE or Gnom
2007-09-17T11:05:00.000Z	KurtKraut	rafaelscj	*Gnome
2007-09-17T11:06:00.000Z	KurtKraut	rafaelscj	XFCE is nice for PCs with 256mb of RAM or less.
2007-09-23T10:53:00.000Z	KurtKraut	rafaelscj	aren't you able to set it to pt-br thru gnome ?
2007-09-23T10:54:00.000Z	rafaelscj	KurtKraut	yes, but it still don't work. I choose the default brazilian's layout (ABNT2)
2007-09-23T11:45:00.000Z	KurtKraut	rafaelscj	it should'nt be the correct approach but works :P
2007-09-23T11:47:00.000Z	rafaelscj	KurtKraut	is there other way to "dead" a key (it was using ascii)
2007-09-23T11:48:00.000Z	KurtKraut	rafaelscj	in theory, you should be able to write in a language different from your keyboard settings by making changes in xorg.conf I guess. But as nickrud said, backup this file. It may be overwritten during an upgrade
2007-09-23T11:50:00.000Z	rafaelscj	KurtKraut	I read something about xorg.conf. really there would be other way
2007-09-23T11:50:00.000Z	KurtKraut	rafaelscj	the guys in forum.ubuntubrasil.org were unable to help you ?
2007-09-23T11:51:00.000Z	rafaelscj	KurtKraut	I found at other forum.
2007-09-23T11:54:00.000Z	rafaelscj	KurtKraut	>>> Option  "XkbLayout" "es" <<< i think this is the line
2007-09-23T11:54:00.000Z	KurtKraut	rafaelscj	don't forget the workaround you did.
