2010-12-15T07:43:00.000Z	nicolaus		thats how i had it
2010-12-15T07:43:00.000Z	KM0201	nicolaus	you don't need to "forge"... just download the .deb from skype.com
2010-12-15T07:44:00.000Z	KM0201	nicolaus	if it's not in a repository, no
2010-12-15T07:44:00.000Z	KM0201	nicolaus	only if its in the repository
2010-12-15T07:49:00.000Z	KM0201	nicolaus	you realize in all the time you've been trying to do this, you could have already downloaded skype.from skype.com, and had it installed?
2010-12-15T07:54:00.000Z	KM0201	nicolaus	PM me, or answer mine, i'll tell you how to add the repo... you're making a mountain out of a mole-hill though
2010-12-15T08:49:00.000Z	KM0201	nicolaus	are you sure you dual booted?.. and didn't erase windows
2010-12-15T09:29:00.000Z	KM0201	nicolaus	why are you so sure of that?... can you mount the windows drive?
2010-12-26T06:34:00.000Z	KM0201	nicolaus	i thought you got it working the other day?
2010-12-26T06:35:00.000Z	KM0201	nicolaus	what kind of camera was it again?
2010-12-26T06:35:00.000Z	KM0201	nicolaus	see if lspci shows what it is.
2010-12-26T06:36:00.000Z	KM0201	nicolaus	hmm, check lsusb (can't imagine it being on the USB bus though)
2010-12-26T06:37:00.000Z	KM0201	nicolaus	well it's gotta be one of those two.
