2006-04-20T08:11:00.000Z	KNO3		Hi, when trying to build wine from source using APT, 'apt-get --build source wine' stops with error "checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
2006-04-20T08:11:00.000Z	KNO3		" "Build command 'cd wine-0.9.11~winehq1 && dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc' failed."
2006-04-20T08:11:00.000Z	roryy	KNO3	install build-essential
2006-04-20T08:12:00.000Z	roryy	KNO3	i'd guess something like 'apt-get build-dep wine' would also be helpful
2006-04-20T08:12:00.000Z	KNO3	roryy	 ok, thanks
2006-04-20T08:12:00.000Z	KNO3	roryy	 yes, i have already done that
2006-04-20T08:13:00.000Z	roryy	KNO3	I guess build-essential isn't in the build dependencies -- odd.
2006-04-20T08:14:00.000Z	KNO3	roryy	 build-essential is alrady installed to the newest version
2006-04-20T08:15:00.000Z	roryy	KNO3	hmm. And 'gcc -v' outputs something informative ?
2006-04-20T08:15:00.000Z	roryy	KNO3	in that case I don't know what the error is.  Are you running ubuntu 5.10 (breezy) ?
2006-04-20T08:16:00.000Z	KNO3	roryy	 yes AMD64
2006-04-20T08:17:00.000Z	roryy	KNO3	hmm. there seems to be no binary packages for wine on amd64 -- perhaps it can't be built there ? see http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=wine&searchon=names&subword=1&version=breezy&release=all
2006-04-20T08:19:00.000Z	KNO3	roryy	 wine has only had time to provide i386 versions
2006-04-20T08:21:00.000Z	KNO3	roryy	 yes, all the packages listed there are i386, apart from the libaries
2006-04-20T08:21:00.000Z	roryy	KNO3	well, my point is, if canonical/ubuntu can't build it, maybe it can't be done
2006-04-20T08:22:00.000Z	roryy	KNO3	maybe it's possible to do a 32-bit chroot thing, but that is beyond my knowledge
2006-04-20T08:22:00.000Z	KNO3	roryy	 yes, i thake your point, do you think that i meight just be better off instaling the i386 build provided
2006-04-20T08:23:00.000Z	roryy	KNO3	if you know how to do that, sure. I don't ;) sorry.
2006-04-20T08:24:00.000Z	KNO3	roryy	 ok, thanks for the help
2006-04-30T13:04:00.000Z	roryy	KNO3	try running 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2006-04-30T13:07:00.000Z	roryy	KNO3	runlevels work differently in ubuntu to redhat/suse
2006-04-30T13:07:00.000Z	roryy	KNO3	once the machine starts, trying Ctrl-Alt-F1 to get a console, or boot in recovery mode
