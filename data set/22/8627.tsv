2005-06-26T05:49:00.000Z	ChurcH_of_FoamY		is there a good program for burning cd's in ubuntu?
2005-06-26T05:50:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	gnomebaker or graveman are very good also
2005-06-26T05:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	so do we :)
2005-06-26T06:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	good idea
2005-07-29T07:30:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	yeah send your money to Linux Jones: Grand Cayman Islands, Grand Cayman :D
2005-08-25T07:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	you mena to make sure integrity of it's files and whatnot ?
2005-08-25T07:15:00.000Z	ChurcH_of_FoamY	LinuxJones	 yes
2005-08-25T07:17:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	after a fresh install you can install a file integrity checker (aide) then it will go over your system and record md5 checksum's of all your important file that you can check later (via cron job, [mailing your the results] ) to verify your system hasn't been rooted or modified without your permission.
2005-08-25T07:17:00.000Z	ChurcH_of_FoamY	LinuxJones	 ok you have my attention how to do this ^_^
2005-08-25T07:20:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	there are good tutorials on aide from google...there is nothing to it really. Update the database after a fresh install , it will spit out a database of your system. Then periodically run a comparison (via cron job) and it will mail the admin a summary of the differnences (if any). Best to search google or check the aide howto.
2006-02-26T09:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	like a cd collection ?
2006-02-26T09:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	or like inventory for a business ?
2006-02-26T09:15:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	so it would be lots and lots of inventory ?
2006-02-26T09:16:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	oh you can use openoffice base for something like that
2006-02-26T09:17:00.000Z	ChurcH_of_FoamY	LinuxJones	 so do you know of a program that can do that?
2006-02-26T09:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	yes open office has a database program called Base for small scale inventory stuff but you will have to enter all of the info by hand. It can be tied into other databases if you have the info already in a datatabase, providing Openoffice can open the database type.
2006-02-26T09:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	it's not a spreadsheet it's like dbase or whatever like foxpro.
2006-02-26T09:22:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	if you have flash installed here are some flash demos of base (the ones at the botton) >> http://k12edcom.org/?q=node/11
2006-02-26T09:25:00.000Z	ChurcH_of_FoamY	LinuxJones	 hey i can't get oo.o2 to work right keeps hanging on me for some reason any other ideas?
2006-02-26T09:25:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	what are you running breezy ?
2006-02-26T09:28:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	other than that I might suggest mysql, there are probably some nice gui tools for creating and managing the inventory much like Base does.
2006-02-26T09:28:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ChurcH_of_FoamY	best to look on the mysql website and see what gui interfaces they have to suite your needs.
