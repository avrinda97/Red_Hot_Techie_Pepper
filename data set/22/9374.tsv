2004-11-22T11:46:00.000Z	Ninko		how do i change really specific preferences in GNOME, e.g., autohide delay for panels
2004-11-22T11:46:00.000Z	Ninko		okey dokey
2004-11-22T11:47:00.000Z	Ninko		and an opinion question: which font do you use in GNOME?
2004-11-22T11:48:00.000Z	Ninko		ohhh is gconf-editor similar to regeit
2004-11-22T11:48:00.000Z	Ninko		haha ok
2004-11-22T11:50:00.000Z	Ninko		i know it's almost sacreligious to the linux crowd, but i wanted to use redmond95/microsoft sans serif
2004-11-22T11:50:00.000Z	Ninko		but since GTK uses the same font for all applications (including the message text in GAIM)...
2004-11-22T11:52:00.000Z	Ninko		=-o rapha: i just use debian unstable repository to download firefox
2004-11-22T11:53:00.000Z	Ninko		oh yeah, is there really a big difference between packages with "ubuntu" in their version names and normal debian packages?
2004-11-22T11:53:00.000Z	rapha	Ninko	Yes I do, but a URL is still needed.
2004-11-22T11:46:00.000Z	rapha	Ninko	Try the "gconf-editor" tool.
2004-11-22T11:47:00.000Z	rapha	Ninko	It's also in the menu under "System Tools" > "Configuration Editor".
2004-11-22T11:47:00.000Z	Ninko	rapha	i thought i had already checked through all the menus, but thanks
2004-11-22T11:47:00.000Z	rapha	Ninko	np. And personally I'm using the "Bitstream Vera" fonts.
2004-11-22T11:52:00.000Z	rapha	Ninko	what's the URL of that?
2004-11-22T11:53:00.000Z	Ninko	rapha	ummm you don't use synaptic?
2004-11-22T11:53:00.000Z	Ninko	rapha	http://http.us.debian.org/debian
2004-11-22T12:18:00.000Z	rapha	Ninko	Then there might not be one for that. But since this ISN'T Windows, you are free to go and change the source code!
2004-11-22T12:19:00.000Z	Ninko	rapha	http://www.fifi.org/doc/gnome-panel-data/html/panel/C/globalpanelprefs.html  <-- there's no menu like that in ubuntu?
2004-11-22T12:20:00.000Z	rapha	Ninko	That control center is VEEERY old.
2004-11-22T12:20:00.000Z	Ninko	rapha	haha, okay, but it still has auto-hide delay!
2004-11-22T12:22:00.000Z	rapha	Ninko	In gconf-editor, go to apps/panel/profiles/defailt/toplevels/<the panel you want to change>/ and find there "hide_delay".
