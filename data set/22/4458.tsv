2008-01-06T02:38:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6		zcat: There's no menubar.
2008-01-06T02:39:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6		zcat: Alt-F2 does nothing. Maybe the desktop/whatever isn't fully loaded?
2008-01-06T02:39:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6		zcat: No idea. Justed started the CD, there's only Examples and Install.
2008-01-06T02:40:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6		zcat: It's stopped loading. There's 240MB. I only have Nautilus accessible directly, besides the desktop icons.
2008-01-06T02:41:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6		zcat: I thought maybe it's "install only" or something.
2008-01-06T02:42:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6		zcat: I didn't plan on using it extensively, just for something specific.
2008-01-06T02:42:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6		zcat: Alternative install must be installed, right? :)
2008-01-06T02:43:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6		zcat: Not really. If it were memory, wouldn't it actively complain? And weren't the requirements 192MB?
2008-01-06T02:45:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6		zcat: I don't mind slow. It definitely seems slower than Knoppix 4, but it will do for now. If it allowed me more control.
2008-01-06T02:45:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6		zcat: Run some checksumming on a few files on NTFS.
2008-01-06T02:45:00.000Z	XBehave	ZiNC2^6	the alternate cd will run faster, the livecd will barely run without swap
2008-01-06T02:46:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	XBehave	Barely would be good enough. :)
2008-01-06T02:56:00.000Z	XBehave	ZiNC2^6	its possible but you would need to mount stuff yourself everytime, a better option for a liveCD bassed system IMO is knoppix (or gnoppix if you hate kde)
2008-01-06T02:56:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	XBehave	Haven't used it much, but I didn't like it, yes. And the little of Gnome I've seen in 7.10 seems nicer.
2008-01-06T03:06:00.000Z	XBehave	ZiNC2^6	 wubi can be used to install ubuntu to a file in a windows partition
2008-01-06T03:07:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	XBehave	What problems? I saw it on the CD. But I thought everything can be done through Ubuntu itself too.
2008-01-06T03:10:00.000Z	XBehave	ZiNC2^6	wubi is unofficial, there are some hacks needed to get ubunutu to work in a file so there can be issues my only experience was bad but do able
2008-01-06T03:11:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	XBehave	It's on the 7.10 CD, but unofficial? And what kind of problems? Destructive, or just... annoyances?
2008-01-06T03:13:00.000Z	XBehave	ZiNC2^6	well i ran into problems that i wouldnt of been able to solve if i was new
2008-01-06T03:14:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	XBehave	If your HDD/data wasn't touched, that's still not too bad.
2008-01-06T03:16:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	XBehave	That's odd. Why does it use more? KDE looked more cluttered. And Knoppix with KDE says it only needs 96MB of RAM for basic operation.
2008-01-06T03:33:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	XBehave	Thanks for the info.
