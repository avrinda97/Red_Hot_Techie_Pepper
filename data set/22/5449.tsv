2007-04-29T15:34:00.000Z	demonspork		How do I set up an extended partition in the manual partition setup during the Ubuntu Install?
2007-04-29T15:35:00.000Z	Flannel	demonspork	eh?  Make a partition, and flag it as extended
2007-05-03T10:14:00.000Z	Flannel	demonspork	thats because ubuntuguide isn't the official documentation, the official wiki is much better
2007-05-03T10:15:00.000Z	Flannel	demonspork	what didn't work about them?  What have you tried so far? etc
2007-05-03T10:17:00.000Z	demonspork	Flannel	I used both the Gstreamer and Xine versions of Totem, VLC, some other random one that I just decided to install to test some more
2007-05-03T10:17:00.000Z	Flannel	demonspork	did you install libdvdcss?
2007-05-03T10:18:00.000Z	Flannel	demonspork	Well, after youre done, check.  If you dont know, then most likely you haven't, which is why nothign works, you dont have the codec
2007-07-03T14:54:00.000Z	Flannel	demonspork	system startup? or user login?
2008-02-23T08:29:00.000Z	Flannel	demonspork	It shouldn't, no.
2008-02-23T08:29:00.000Z	Flannel	demonspork	of course, the mirrors are free to do whatever, they may even be being throttled
2008-02-23T08:29:00.000Z	demonspork	Flannel	I have been mirroring the ubuntu gutsy repo to an external hdd, and I have gotten about half way through and the download rate seems to have cut from 350 to 10kbps
2008-02-26T05:30:00.000Z	Flannel	demonspork	sudo -i, etc, etc.
2008-02-26T05:30:00.000Z	Flannel	demonspork	Whats the problem?
2008-06-18T09:37:00.000Z	Flannel	demonspork	Which directory are you looking to change?
2012-03-04T00:14:00.000Z	Flannel	demonspork	are you on Btrfs by any chance?
2012-03-04T00:14:00.000Z	demonspork	Flannel	no
2012-03-04T00:15:00.000Z	Flannel	demonspork	Is it chmodded 600?
2012-03-04T00:15:00.000Z	demonspork	Flannel	yes
2012-03-04T00:16:00.000Z	Flannel	demonspork	Can you please pastebin the terminal session where you're doing all of this?  The only thing I can think of is some small silly mistake somewhere, a second set of eyes may help.
2012-03-04T00:19:00.000Z	Flannel	demonspork	Which script did you use to install it?  I'm not familiar with CR48s at all.
2012-03-04T00:20:00.000Z	demonspork	Flannel	I used this script: http://chromeos-cr48.blogspot.com/2011/04/ubuntu-1104-for-cr-48-is-ready.html
2012-03-04T00:23:00.000Z	demonspork	Flannel	as requested, pastebin of me creating the swapfile: http://pastebin.com/NPa6FG6e
