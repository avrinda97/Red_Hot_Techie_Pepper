2004-10-13T10:08:00.000Z	nate		I take it Debian has no conception of a 'service'?
2004-10-13T10:08:00.000Z	nate		I miss SysV init
2004-10-13T10:08:00.000Z	nate		it is? Hmm
2004-10-13T10:09:00.000Z	nate		then why is there no GUI tool for managing services like there is in Fedora?
2004-10-13T10:10:00.000Z	nate		and in the Fedora world such a tool is the very first thing you look at after installing
2004-10-13T10:10:00.000Z	nate		which surprises me that it's not there
2004-10-13T10:11:00.000Z	nate		there's no chkconfig either
2004-10-13T10:12:00.000Z	nate		how can one admin SysV init without a chkconfig?
2004-10-13T10:12:00.000Z	nate		oww
2004-10-13T10:12:00.000Z	nate		that's pretty primitive
2004-10-13T10:12:00.000Z	wm_eddie	nate	or pretty advanced...
2004-10-13T10:14:00.000Z	wm_eddie	nate	I'm sure there's something in universe that can guify that
2004-10-13T10:14:00.000Z	wm_eddie	nate	have you tried apt-get install chkconfig?
2004-10-13T10:15:00.000Z	nate	wm_eddie	could not find package chkconfig
2004-10-13T10:15:00.000Z	wm_eddie	nate	well at least we tried :)
2004-10-13T10:16:00.000Z	wm_eddie	nate	what is it you want to do anyway?
2004-10-13T10:16:00.000Z	nate	wm_eddie	I want to find out what services are active
2004-10-13T10:16:00.000Z	wm_eddie	nate	I haven't really ever messed with any of that.
2004-10-13T10:21:00.000Z	wm_eddie	nate	I'm asking around.
2004-10-13T10:32:00.000Z	wm_eddie	nate	there's a KDE app called ksysv I think as well.
2004-10-13T10:44:00.000Z	wm_eddie	nate	< piman> You should manage it with update-rc.d, and run them with
2004-10-13T10:59:00.000Z	wm_eddie	nate	People say that we shouldn't be using apt-get as our front-end.
