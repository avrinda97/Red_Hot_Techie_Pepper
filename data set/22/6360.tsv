2007-06-13T11:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	Yes, I'll get the link

2007-06-13T11:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	Why are you compiling the new nvidia drivers?
2007-06-13T11:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	Try envy
2007-06-17T14:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	NTFS?
2007-06-17T14:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	Run an fsck to repair the disk
2007-06-17T14:12:00.000Z	robert_	Jordan_U	the disk is my /home drive
2007-06-17T14:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	I think that this command will make an fsck run the next time you boot : sudo touch /forcecheck
2007-09-05T16:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	Yes
2007-09-05T16:09:00.000Z	robert_	Jordan_U	I thought so.
2007-09-05T16:09:00.000Z	robert_	Jordan_U	then why does Setup always want to select the primary IDE disk on the laptop?
2007-09-05T16:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	You shouldn't use the regular installer for installing to a thumb drive, it will be too big and will wear out the drive quickly
2007-09-05T16:12:00.000Z	robert_	Jordan_U	what should I use? Im not planning on using it as a restore install
2007-09-05T16:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
2007-09-05T16:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	I don't know, wiki.ubuntu.com just likes https :)
2007-09-05T16:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	Live pen drive?
2007-09-05T16:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	syslinux won't boot from ext2 IIRC. the whole point is that it is only really using the Fat FIle system for a file called squashfs which is mounted as / in a live session
2007-12-03T11:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	Are you just getting squares?
2007-12-03T11:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	Do you have compiz-fusion-plugins-extra installed?
2007-12-03T11:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	Ahh, see crdlb's comment, it's in plugins-unsupported
2007-12-03T11:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	robert_	Apparently it's also not included in the default repositories, so your going to have to look around for a .deb or install it manually :(
