2011-03-20T02:47:00.000Z	nictrasavios	ubuntum0n	yes i do :) 7 infact.
2011-03-20T02:48:00.000Z	ubuntum0n	nictrasavios	i'm having an issue when i log out of an account. the screen just goes black and there isnt a login screen
2011-03-20T02:49:00.000Z	nictrasavios	ubuntum0n	hmm. dose it go black to a command line and some text? Or just black black. Is the computer still on or dose it appear shutdown? (sleep, hibernation,etc)
2011-03-20T02:49:00.000Z	nictrasavios	ubuntum0n	oh, and what level of user are you? Do you know a litte, or alot about ubuntu?
2011-03-20T02:50:00.000Z	ubuntum0n	nictrasavios	the computer is still running. no command line. not even by hitting 'control+alt+f1' or 'control+alt+f7'
2011-03-20T02:51:00.000Z	nictrasavios	ubuntum0n	have you done any odd customisation? such as messing with somthing known as "gdm" or have you changed the login manager in anyway?
2011-03-20T02:52:00.000Z	ubuntum0n	nictrasavios	no. i have version 10.04 on another computer and it runs fine. i just installed 10.10 via wubi on this computer. its also running windows
2011-03-20T02:52:00.000Z	nictrasavios	ubuntum0n	 i want you to go to your terminal, type in "lspci" and paste the results to http://paste.ubuntu.com/
2011-03-20T02:53:00.000Z	ubuntum0n	nictrasavios	thanks. will do
2011-03-20T02:53:00.000Z	nictrasavios	ubuntum0n	just send the link of the paste when done :)

2011-03-20T02:56:00.000Z	nictrasavios	ubuntum0n	alright, i did some research. , can you send me the link to your pastebin
2011-03-20T02:56:00.000Z	nictrasavios	ubuntum0n	im 70% sure i know whats causeing it :)
2011-03-20T02:58:00.000Z	ubuntum0n	nictrasavios	thanks for the help
2011-03-20T03:02:00.000Z	nictrasavios	ubuntum0n	alright, try turning off desktop effects. Its a problem with your graphics card, from looking through about 10-15 pages, i cannot find a solution. Most reinstalled... no word on if it helped or not. It seems many people have had this problem, Try looking for drivers for your hardware, i am ,personally, not knowlageable on drivers. But i from what i can see, your issue has everything to do with xwindows not starting properly
2011-03-20T03:02:00.000Z	nictrasavios		after a session has ended. One workaround for it is, instead of logging off, switch users instead. Although a little less secure, this may help. You said your running under a wubi install? This may be part of it. Although thats only an educated guess.
2011-03-20T03:02:00.000Z	ubuntum0n	nictrasavios	ok. thanks alot. i'll check it out
2011-03-20T03:04:00.000Z	ubuntum0n	nictrasavios	one more thing: the login screen will display correctly after a boot. but if you log off, blackness. the only resolve is to reboot (hassle but livable)
