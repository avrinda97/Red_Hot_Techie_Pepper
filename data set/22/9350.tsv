2011-10-15T11:57:00.000Z	chroot		i want to creat a usb startup disk in ubuntu , for windows , how
2011-10-15T11:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	 ive heard you can 'dd' the win7 iso to a pendrive.. but never tried it.
2011-10-15T12:04:00.000Z	chroot	dr_willis	what ?
2011-10-15T12:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	 Huh?
2011-10-15T12:06:00.000Z	chroot	dr_willis	i just want to install windows along with ubuntu for the other computer
2011-10-15T12:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	 and windows will overwrite the grub bootloader. and you will have to some how reparir the grub boot loader.
2011-10-15T12:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	 if you have a spare flash drive. you can set up grub on it in addation to on the hard drive. and use the pendrive to boot the linux os. after windows  overwrites grub..
2011-10-15T12:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	 you an put the iso on a usb in many differnt ways... if thats what you want.
2011-10-15T12:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	 i just use  the tools, or do an image to my pendrive.
2011-10-15T12:10:00.000Z	chroot	dr_willis	how , you must use a software , not just copy the iso file to your pendrive
2011-10-15T12:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	 you can use 'dd' to IMAGE the iso to a pendrive - starting with 11.10 - but that wont make a persistant save file.
2011-10-15T12:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	 i only use a persistant setup for a few special cases. I found them to be to fragile.
2011-11-10T14:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	 vlc foo.iso   may work
2011-11-10T14:13:00.000Z	chroot	dr_willis	vlc foo.iso isn't work, but Gskellig's working.
2012-02-13T13:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	ethtool. ifconfig
2012-02-13T13:34:00.000Z	chroot	dr_willis	thanks,
2012-02-13T13:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	you can change the mac yes
2012-02-13T13:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	 again. ifconfig. or ethtool
2012-02-13T14:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	 clarify what you mean
2012-02-13T14:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	 why do you have them installed then .
2012-02-13T14:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	 if upstart runs them check /etc/init.d  i think
2012-02-13T14:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	chroot	 ssh makes them redundant
