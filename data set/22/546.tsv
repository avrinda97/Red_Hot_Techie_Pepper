2011-08-01T16:10:00.000Z	somethinginteres		Hi all, I have Japanese language support installed alongside English. Sometimes when I am typing the language swaps to Japanese
2011-08-01T16:10:00.000Z	somethinginteres		I am wanting to work out how to change it back. There's no icon anywhere. Thanks
2011-08-01T16:11:00.000Z	ldr	somethinginteres	alt+alt or alt+shift lets you switch the layout on most systems
2011-08-01T16:12:00.000Z	ldr	somethinginteres	maybe that is what you accendentially doing when you are typing
2011-08-01T16:12:00.000Z	somethinginteres	ldr	yeah, it probably is. thanks! I will try that next time it occurs.
2011-08-01T16:13:00.000Z	somethinginteres	ldr	ok just tried it then. It did swap the language to Japanese but the same key combo wouldn't swap it back to English.
2011-08-01T16:15:00.000Z	ldr	somethinginteres	hmm it should sec
2011-08-01T16:17:00.000Z	ldr	somethinginteres	okay do the following go to system->preferences->kexyboard
2011-08-01T16:17:00.000Z	ldr	somethinginteres	Layout Options
2011-08-01T16:17:00.000Z	ldr	somethinginteres	expand group shift lock behavior their you can define your own switch key or i think completly deactivate it
2011-08-01T16:20:00.000Z	somethinginteres	ldr	OK I am in layout --> Options can't find "shift lock behaviour" group
2011-08-01T16:20:00.000Z	ldr		one sec
2011-08-01T16:20:00.000Z	somethinginteres	ldr	no problem
2011-08-01T16:20:00.000Z	ldr	somethinginteres	Group shift?
2011-08-01T16:20:00.000Z	ldr		or something i didnt have the same system here actually
2011-08-01T16:22:00.000Z	ldr	somethinginteres	 what desktop/ubuntu are you using?
2011-08-01T16:22:00.000Z	somethinginteres	ldr	Ubuntu 11.04 Unity 64 bit
2011-08-01T16:23:00.000Z	ldr	somethinginteres	maybe accesibility?
2011-08-01T16:24:00.000Z	ldr	somethinginteres	got it choose your layout, and then lcik keyboard preferences
2011-08-01T16:25:00.000Z	ldr	somethinginteres	then options and then their is a key to change layout option
2011-08-01T16:26:00.000Z	somethinginteres	ldr	hmm I just can't seem to find it. I'll see if I can do a screenshot
2011-08-01T16:28:00.000Z	somethinginteres	ldr	found it selected Alt + Shift didn't seem to make a difference, I've exited the app and will try again
