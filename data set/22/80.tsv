2012-08-19T16:48:00.000Z	KM0201	moosers	you'd probably want to use lxde w/ only 1gig of ram.. .at least in my opinion
2012-08-19T16:49:00.000Z	moosers		yeah this was what I was asking Dr_Willis if this is a good idea
2012-08-19T16:49:00.000Z	moosers		sudo apt-get install lxde
2012-08-19T16:49:00.000Z	moosers		i think this is all i need to do
2012-08-19T16:49:00.000Z	KM0201	moosers	i think you'd just install lubuntu-desktop...
2012-08-19T16:50:00.000Z	KM0201	moosers	or just download the lubuntu ISO, and boot it from a USB/CD
2012-08-19T16:50:00.000Z	moosers		yeah this is what Dr_Willis trying to explain me. sorry Dr_Willis
2012-08-19T16:50:00.000Z	moosers	KM0201	 can I donwload lubuntu-desktop from ubuntu software center?
2012-08-19T16:50:00.000Z	KM0201	moosers	yes
