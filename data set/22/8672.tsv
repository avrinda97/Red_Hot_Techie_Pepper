2008-02-10T00:15:00.000Z	ffm	ubuntu	wahts up?
2008-02-10T00:17:00.000Z	ubuntu	ffm	: error 15 , after editing "menu.lst" and deleting the added text !!
2008-02-10T00:17:00.000Z	ffm	ubuntu	do you have a livecd?
2008-02-10T00:17:00.000Z	ffm	ubuntu	and can you boot at all?
2008-02-10T00:17:00.000Z	ubuntu	ffm	: that's how i am here ! :)
2008-02-10T00:18:00.000Z	ffm	ubuntu	are you on the broken machine via a livecd?
2008-02-10T00:18:00.000Z	ffm	ubuntu	lets see... is /boot on a separate partition, or is all of / on the same partition? (Did you set up partitions yoruself, or do so automagicaly?)
2008-02-10T00:19:00.000Z	ubuntu	ffm	: myself
2008-02-10T00:20:00.000Z	ffm	ubuntu	is /boot on its own partition? or is it with the rest of / ?
2008-02-10T00:20:00.000Z	ubuntu	ffm	: na , they r together !
2008-02-10T00:21:00.000Z	ffm	ubuntu	then mount the partition, and chroot into it.
2008-02-10T00:21:00.000Z	ffm	ubuntu	ie if partition is mounted at /foo/bar, run "chroot /foo/bar" as root.
2008-02-10T00:22:00.000Z	ubuntu	ffm	: and ?
2008-02-10T00:22:00.000Z	ffm	ubuntu	"update-grub"

2008-02-10T00:25:00.000Z	ffm	ubuntu	reboot...
2008-02-10T00:26:00.000Z	ubuntu	ffm	: that's all ? well ... thx , i'll try !
2008-02-10T00:26:00.000Z	ffm	ubuntu	that should be it.
2008-02-10T00:35:00.000Z	ubuntu	ffm	: it didn't work :(
