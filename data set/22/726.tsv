2011-05-17T06:01:00.000Z	uabn93		Hi, is there a way to get back a file that was deleted through "gksudo nautilus". It never went to the trash, it just deleted it.
2011-05-17T06:02:00.000Z	escott	uabn93	it might be in root's trash which is not visible to normal users
2011-05-17T06:08:00.000Z	escott	uabn93	you should install etc-keeper for future instances like this. you can get the file back by finding what package it was in and reinstalling it
2011-05-17T06:09:00.000Z	uabn93	escott	do you know of any way of getting that file back? It wont let me compile unless the file is there.
2011-05-17T06:11:00.000Z	escott	uabn93	i would reinstall the firmware-ralink package
2011-05-17T06:15:00.000Z	uabn93	escott	won't work for my card but thanks for helping. bye.
2012-11-16T04:30:00.000Z	escott	uabn93	there are other ways to backup... if you want help with some of those just ask
2012-11-16T04:31:00.000Z	escott	uabn93	but i reached much the same conclusion about deja-dup and decided that wasn't the backup tool for me
2012-11-16T04:31:00.000Z	uabn93	escott	what do you mean other ways? do you suggest another program?
2012-11-16T04:31:00.000Z	escott	uabn93	i use rsync
2012-11-16T04:34:00.000Z	uabn93	escott	i really only used deja because it supports incremental backups WITH compression
2012-11-16T04:35:00.000Z	escott	uabn93	you can do the same with rsync but without the nasty tarballs
2012-11-16T04:36:00.000Z	uabn93	escott	cool. ill check out grsync because i dont feel comfortable with the cli version yet
2012-11-16T04:36:00.000Z	escott	uabn93	and unless you have lots of big text files im not sure what compression gets you. might be better to put it all on a filesystem that does compression
2012-11-16T04:39:00.000Z	uabn93	escott	I see. All i have related to that are books but thats pdf not txt
2012-11-16T04:40:00.000Z	escott	uabn93	i dont know what kind of compression ratios you will get with pdfs but its not going to be earth-shattering
2012-11-16T04:41:00.000Z	uabn93	escott	okay. so it wouldnt do much for music and video files either?
2012-11-16T04:41:00.000Z	escott	uabn93	no
2012-11-16T04:42:00.000Z	escott	uabn93	unless you are storing your music as wav files :)
2012-11-16T04:43:00.000Z	uabn93	escott	heh. I use flac but thats already compressed. i think i need to read up on compression
2012-11-16T04:44:00.000Z	escott	uabn93	long and short is only the first compression is likely to be helpful... unless the first compression is very poor a subsequent compression wont do much
2012-11-16T04:47:00.000Z	uabn93	escott	i appreciate your help
