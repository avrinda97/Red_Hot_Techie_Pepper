2009-05-05T11:13:00.000Z	Guest71437	raylu	cool thanks that takes care of part of the problem :)
2009-05-05T11:13:00.000Z	raylu	Guest71437	the other part?
2009-05-05T11:14:00.000Z	Guest71437	raylu	Im going to need something to write the ip and the port in this format ip:port to that file. but its in an xml document
2009-05-05T11:14:00.000Z	raylu	Guest71437	then this isn't part of the solution
2009-05-05T11:14:00.000Z	Guest71437	raylu	well actually let me ask you this first
2009-05-05T11:15:00.000Z	raylu	Guest71437	what you want is a script that parses the xml document and runs that command itself
2009-05-05T11:15:00.000Z	Guest71437	raylu	well the problem is i have this script that launches the program right? but it needs to add the argument +connect ip:port after the script if i run the script like ./scriptname +connect ip:port that wont work, for some reason it has to be in the file itself
2009-05-05T11:16:00.000Z	Guest71437	raylu	do you know why that might be?
2009-05-05T11:16:00.000Z	raylu	Guest71437	er, i don't understand
2009-05-05T11:17:00.000Z	Guest71437	raylu	alright so lets say you have a script and it is name beans right?
2009-05-05T11:17:00.000Z	Guest71437	raylu	so lets say you need to pass an argument to that script and the argument is +connect ip:port
2009-05-05T11:17:00.000Z	Guest71437	raylu	if INSIDE the script you add +connect ip:port to the end of the file, it will work
2009-05-05T11:18:00.000Z	Guest71437	raylu	but if you do ./beans +connect ip:port that wont work
2009-05-05T11:18:00.000Z	raylu	Guest71437	er, that's more of an issue with the script itself
2009-05-05T11:18:00.000Z	raylu	Guest71437	different scripting languages have different ways of handling arguments

2009-05-05T11:19:00.000Z	Guest71437	raylu	that is a post i made on it
2009-05-05T11:19:00.000Z	Guest71437	raylu	actually this one might be better http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=7214683#post7214683
2009-05-05T11:19:00.000Z	Guest71437	raylu	so you see that part that says <connect> and ip:port that is what it should be adding to the end of the script
2009-05-05T11:20:00.000Z	raylu	Guest71437	anyway, i need to go now; sorry
2009-05-05T11:20:00.000Z	Guest71437	raylu	ok no problem
