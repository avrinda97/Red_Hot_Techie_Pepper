2008-12-12T06:51:00.000Z	craigbass1976	qcjn	I just walked in so I didn't see your previous conversation
2008-12-12T06:52:00.000Z	qcjn	craigbass1976	you know about ssh ?
2008-12-12T06:52:00.000Z	craigbass1976	qcjn	I do.  What cooking?  You're logging into a new ubunt install?
2008-12-12T06:53:00.000Z	qcjn	craigbass1976	no, i m on 8.04, but i,M regularly having problem connecting no host
2008-12-12T06:53:00.000Z	craigbass1976	qcjn	connecting TO the 8.04 box?
2008-12-12T06:54:00.000Z	craigbass1976	qcjn	can you ever connect?
2008-12-12T06:56:00.000Z	qcjn	craigbass1976	once it connect's once it dont' ?
2008-12-12T06:56:00.000Z	craigbass1976	qcjn	 I was goingto have you look at /var/log/secure, but I don't see it on this box (Feisty)  I'm used to red hat.  Lemme keep looking...
2008-12-12T06:57:00.000Z	craigbass1976	qcjn	is there a /var/log/secure on your box?
2008-12-12T06:57:00.000Z	qcjn	craigbass1976	just now i,ve mange to get to the password, it seem's to wan,t to connect , but it doesn't show the prompt like ususal
2008-12-12T06:58:00.000Z	qcjn	craigbass1976	ok, it showa the prompt, but it took for ever
2008-12-12T06:58:00.000Z	craigbass1976	qcjn	I've noticed that Ubuntu is wicked slow in asking for a password the first few times I ssh in from a particular box.  It's ALWAYS slow when I'm using putty
2008-12-12T06:59:00.000Z	craigbass1976	qcjn	that is probably your problem too.  Are you using putty?
2008-12-12T07:02:00.000Z	craigbass1976	qcjn	so, you have an existing 8.04 install that you're trying to log into from another box that you have used for a while logging into this?
2008-12-12T07:03:00.000Z	craigbass1976	qcjn	I would log into it, then tail -f /var/log/auth.log, then open up another terminal and log into it again, and watch what's going on in the log file
2008-12-12T07:04:00.000Z	craigbass1976	qcjn	I've got to go, but I will come back in from the gutsy livecd
2008-12-12T07:04:00.000Z	qcjn	craigbass1976	i have 2 computers with ubuntu 8.04
