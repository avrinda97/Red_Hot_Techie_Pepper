2010-01-03T19:36:00.000Z	Undertow		Can someone help me with disabling onboard video?  Please take a look at this output: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d20c30f8c
2010-01-03T19:38:00.000Z	Undertow		I can do that, but shouldnt blacklisting the modules prevent it from working?
2010-01-03T19:38:00.000Z	Undertow		I have a garbage dell that only lets me choose onboard or auto in the bios
2010-01-03T19:39:00.000Z	Undertow		and I had to blacklist it before to get the nvidia to work
2010-01-03T19:39:00.000Z	iceroot	Undertow	disable it in bios
2010-01-03T19:39:00.000Z	Undertow		the problem is, when I boot with the nvidia adapter, it wont boot
2010-01-03T19:40:00.000Z	Undertow		I cant even get into recovery mode
2010-01-03T19:40:00.000Z	Undertow		and Im pretty sure its trying to use the onboard adapter in ubuntu
2010-01-03T19:40:00.000Z	Undertow		yeah
2010-01-03T19:40:00.000Z	Undertow		I always had to blacklist i915/agpgart before
2010-01-03T19:41:00.000Z	Undertow		and I'm just trying to verify that the onboard IS disabled by booting with it for now
2010-01-03T19:41:00.000Z	Undertow		and it never gets disabled
2010-01-03T19:41:00.000Z	Undertow		unless somehow the kernel is forcing it to use the i915 modules regardless of what I do with modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
2010-01-03T19:42:00.000Z	Undertow		which is seeming that way
2010-01-03T19:42:00.000Z	Undertow		is it possible to disable kernel modules from loading?  or is that what blacklist.conf does
2010-01-03T19:42:00.000Z	iceroot	Undertow	thats what blacklist does
2010-01-03T19:43:00.000Z	Undertow		so why does it still say it's being used after I blacklisted it?
2010-01-03T19:43:00.000Z	iceroot		!blacklist | Undertow
2010-01-03T19:43:00.000Z	Undertow	iceroot	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d20c30f8c
2010-01-03T19:43:00.000Z	Undertow		check that out please
2010-01-03T19:45:00.000Z	Undertow	iceroot	did you look at that output?
2010-01-03T19:45:00.000Z	iceroot	Undertow	dont have a x-server here
