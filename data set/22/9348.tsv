2011-07-16T22:24:00.000Z	Pin		Hi, How can I make my Ubuntu 11.04 Faster? Anything I can do to make it even faster? (tweaks etc?)
2011-07-16T22:24:00.000Z	Pin		!speed
2011-07-16T22:24:00.000Z	Pin		!fast
2011-07-16T22:24:00.000Z	Pin		!speedup
2011-07-16T22:24:00.000Z	Pin		!optimize
2011-07-16T22:26:00.000Z	Pin		!xserver? whats that, and how?
2011-07-16T22:26:00.000Z	Pin		lol @ ubottu
2011-07-16T22:27:00.000Z	Pin		?
2011-07-16T22:27:00.000Z	StevenR	Pin	ok. what do you want to make faster?
2011-07-16T22:28:00.000Z	StevenR	Pin	it gives you a text-mode login.
2011-07-16T22:28:00.000Z	StevenR	Pin	first find out where the bottleneck is then
2011-07-16T22:31:00.000Z	StevenR	Pin	first, you need to find out where the bottlenecks are.
2011-07-16T22:31:00.000Z	StevenR	Pin	are you running with effects disabled?
2011-07-16T22:33:00.000Z	StevenR	Pin	ok. well, you still need to analyse your system (using top, or system monitor, etc) to find out what's causing a performance bottleneck. Until you know what's slowing it down, how can you improve it?
2011-07-16T22:34:00.000Z	StevenR	Pin	open a terminal. run "top" (you'll probably also want to read the manpage for top too), and watch it.
2011-07-16T22:40:00.000Z	StevenR	Pin	no.
2011-07-16T22:41:00.000Z	StevenR	Pin	it would be better to analyse your system with tools like top to find out what's using resources and then basing your tuning on that.
2011-07-16T22:42:00.000Z	StevenR	Pin	how do you expect to fix it, without knowing why it's slow? (Yes, this involves work on your part to learn to use htop or top and interpret the results)
2011-07-16T22:43:00.000Z	StevenR	Pin	ok. well you need to *find out what these things are* :)
2011-07-16T22:44:00.000Z	StevenR	Pin	I've told you. Use htop or top.
2011-07-16T22:44:00.000Z	StevenR	Pin	first, work out what they are, then work out what to do about them :)
2011-07-16T22:45:00.000Z	StevenR	Pin	ok, well, what does htop say then?
