2005-08-08T09:54:00.000Z	luminerd	Seveas	it's on LQ, but I'm desperately in need of fast help!
2005-08-08T10:06:00.000Z	Seveas	luminerd	stop repeating and try the mailinglist/forums. it is clear that no-one in here can help you...
2005-08-08T10:07:00.000Z	luminerd	Seveas	I have posted it on the forums.  I am waiting for a response.
2005-08-08T10:08:00.000Z	luminerd	Seveas	and the only time I repeated was when you requested me to do so.  All other times I have rephrased.
