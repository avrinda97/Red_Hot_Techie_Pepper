2005-04-01T14:20:00.000Z	kotatsu	sylvesterxxl	get codecs from mplayerhq.hu for divx, for mp3 playback there are a ton of programs... beep, xmms, rhythmbox, etc.
2005-04-01T14:21:00.000Z	kotatsu	sylvesterxxl	check out the wiki at ubuntulinux.com for how to set up mp3 playback
2005-04-01T14:23:00.000Z	kotatsu	sylvesterxxl	they're not closed, that's just a notice before the main page
2005-04-01T14:24:00.000Z	kotatsu	sylvesterxxl	none, you just have to try them out to see which you like the most... I use beep media player
2005-04-01T14:25:00.000Z	kotatsu	sylvesterxxl	I like it
2005-04-01T14:25:00.000Z	kotatsu	sylvesterxxl	it's a fork of xmms, the perennial favorite linux music player
2005-04-01T14:28:00.000Z	sylvesterxxl	kotatsu	can u help me to install it? come with me to mplayerhq and tell me what files to download please
2005-04-01T14:29:00.000Z	sylvesterxxl	kotatsu	can u help me to install it? come with me to mplayerhq and tell me what files to download please
2005-04-01T14:29:00.000Z	kotatsu	sylvesterxxl	go to the download page and get the "essential codecs package"
2005-04-01T14:33:00.000Z	kotatsu	sylvesterxxl	you have to extract the files into /usr/local/lib/codecs
2005-04-01T14:36:00.000Z	sylvesterxxl	kotatsu	i go to usr them to local and to lib but there is no codec folder only i see is forther python 2.3
2005-04-01T14:37:00.000Z	kotatsu	sylvesterxxl	yes, you have to create it... alternatively, it looks like ubuntuguide.org has instructions on how to get the codecs
