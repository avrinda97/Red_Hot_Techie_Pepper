2005-07-10T09:36:00.000Z	nikkia	golgor	there are grub-floppy and grub-cd images on the net that can be used to repair a grub install
2005-07-10T09:42:00.000Z	nikkia	golgor	yes, IMO
2005-07-10T09:55:00.000Z	golgor	nikkia	query :P
2005-07-10T11:05:00.000Z	nikkia	golgor	use the .run
2005-07-10T11:06:00.000Z	golgor	nikkia	?
2005-07-10T11:06:00.000Z	nikkia	golgor	there should be a .run file available for the nforce drivers
2005-07-10T11:06:00.000Z	nikkia	golgor	i've never had any problems getting those to run on debian and debian-like systems
2005-07-10T11:07:00.000Z	nikkia	golgor	 no, i mean a .run file you can download from nvidia's site
2005-07-10T11:08:00.000Z	golgor	nikkia	where do you find those drivers, are they for nf2?
2005-07-10T11:08:00.000Z	nikkia	golgor	on nvidia's web site, by following the links for drivers
2005-07-10T11:09:00.000Z	golgor	nikkia	thanks
2005-07-10T11:09:00.000Z	nikkia	golgor	see, for example, the first link on this page: http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_nforce_1.0-0301.html
2005-07-10T11:11:00.000Z	golgor	nikkia	i get an error
2005-07-10T11:12:00.000Z	golgor	nikkia	the installation cant find any precompiled kernel interface
2005-07-10T11:14:00.000Z	golgor	nikkia	are you familiar with the error: "No precompiled kernel interface was found to match your kernel"
2005-07-10T11:14:00.000Z	nikkia	golgor	yes, it means you need the kernel headers to build the modules
2005-07-10T11:15:00.000Z	golgor	nikkia	and how to do that?
2005-07-10T11:15:00.000Z	nikkia	golgor	you'll need to download the .debs for the linux-headers packages manually, put them on a CD and carry them to the PC that way, i suspect (since i'm guessing the PC in question isn't online as it has no ethernet drivers without the nforce drivers)
2005-07-10T11:16:00.000Z	golgor	nikkia	im online with this computer (ubuntu) using another nw card
2005-07-10T11:16:00.000Z	nikkia	golgor	ok, then easy, just install the linux-headers package via your favourite package manager :)
2005-07-10T11:22:00.000Z	golgor	nikkia	do i need to reboot or something after installation?
2005-07-10T14:06:00.000Z	golgor	nikkia	are you there?
