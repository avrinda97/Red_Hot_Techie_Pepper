2006-07-27T14:00:00.000Z	userundefine	jordan_	what are you trying to make an IMG file of?
2006-07-27T14:01:00.000Z	userundefine	jordan_	ah.  Do you have the disk?
2006-07-27T14:04:00.000Z	userundefine	jordan_	then just make an ISO from it.  It's the same thing.  You can rename it from .iso to .img if you *must* have it as that and it should work.
2006-07-27T14:06:00.000Z	userundefine	jordan_	I've never installed Win2k so I can't help you slipstreaming, sorry
2006-07-27T14:10:00.000Z	userundefine	jordan_	if you have the files required from floppy, you could just create a virtual drive and point vmware to it, such as an ISO.  If you have the files on disk (as opposed to using your broken floppy), just use mkisofs -o /path/to/ISO/cd.iso /path/to/files/for/ISO
2006-07-27T14:11:00.000Z	userundefine	jordan_	that'd be what I'd try
2006-07-27T14:11:00.000Z	userundefine	jordan_	I put your full name in.  Just type the first few letters of a person's name a hit [TAB] , it autocompletes
2006-07-27T14:12:00.000Z	jordan_	userundefine	 This it?
2006-07-27T14:12:00.000Z	userundefine	jordan_	yep
2006-07-27T14:16:00.000Z	jordan_	userundefine	Wait for the (mkisofs -o /path/to/ISO/cd.iso /path/to/files/for/ISO) Thing. See i have a the file that needs to be on the floppy On my desktop and i need a .img
2006-07-27T14:16:00.000Z	jordan_	userundefine	Is There a way to make one from scratch
2006-07-27T14:16:00.000Z	userundefine	jordan_	what's the file's name?
2006-07-27T14:17:00.000Z	userundefine	jordan_	nevermind, that doesn't matter.
2006-07-27T14:17:00.000Z	jordan_	userundefine	/home/jordan/winnt.sif
2006-07-27T14:18:00.000Z	userundefine	jordan_	just put the file you want to burn in its own folder.  then do " mkisofs -o ~/floppy.iso /home/jordan/*folder*/ " where *folder* is the new folder you put the file in.  It'll make an ISO of the folder, and then just rename it from .iso to .img
