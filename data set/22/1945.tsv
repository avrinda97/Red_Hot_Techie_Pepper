2009-11-13T03:48:00.000Z	ElNombre		I need help playing DVDs, I've followed all the guides I can find, and I've installed every package I can... no matter what I try, I always get the same problem - it stutters and skips and it's just unwatchable, can anyone help me pelase?
2009-11-13T03:48:00.000Z	nyk2005	ElNombre	tried mplayer dvd:// ?
2009-11-13T03:49:00.000Z	ElNombre	nyk2005	sorry, what do you mean? I've tried using lots of different media players, it's always the exact same
2009-11-13T03:50:00.000Z	ElNombre	nyk2005	I typed it into the terminal, I have a bunch of text now, what should I be looking for?
2009-11-13T03:51:00.000Z	nyk2005	ElNombre	or just try to play one of the VOBs using mplayer.
2009-11-13T03:53:00.000Z	ElNombre	nyk2005	when I start browsing the DVD my whole computer starts stuttering... could this mean the hardware is the problem?
2009-11-13T03:56:00.000Z	ElNombre	nyk2005	I've tried opening the VOBs in mplayer, exactly the same thing happens
2009-11-13T03:56:00.000Z	nyk2005	ElNombre	if you copy them to hdd first too?
2009-11-13T03:59:00.000Z	ElNombre	nyk2005	I've copied a file over, it won't run though, and it has a little padlock icon. But since the whole computer stutters when I'm browsing the DVD, I'm guessing the hardware is at fault?
2009-11-13T03:59:00.000Z	ElNombre	nyk2005	wait, nevermind, I'm able to open it in VLC, it still stutters
2009-11-13T04:01:00.000Z	nyk2005	ElNombre	so something is too slow I guess? it also stutters from hdd? is your video card using it proper driver?
2009-11-13T04:02:00.000Z	ElNombre	nyk2005	when I was using windows DVDs played fine, so it's not a hardware issue. I've installed graphics drivers and I can play other media files fine, so I think my graphics card is working okay
2009-11-13T04:02:00.000Z	ElNombre	nyk2005	but yeah it is stuttering from the hard drive, so maybe my computer is having problems playing the VOG format..?
2009-11-13T04:05:00.000Z	nyk2005	ElNombre	is it an old computer?
2009-11-13T04:05:00.000Z	ElNombre	nyk2005	it's not amazingly new but like I say, DVDs still run find under windows
2009-11-13T04:06:00.000Z	nyk2005	ElNombre	what video card=
2009-11-13T04:06:00.000Z	ElNombre	nyk2005	ATI Radeon HD 2600 XT
2009-11-13T04:07:00.000Z	nyk2005	ElNombre	and X is using the ati driver or just vesa?
2009-11-13T04:08:00.000Z	ElNombre	nyk2005	I'm pretty sure I installed an ATI driver when I installed ubuntu, I was initially having similar problems playing any media at all, but after I installed the drivers it started working
2009-11-13T04:15:00.000Z	ElNombre	nyk2005	sorry if I'm being impatient, but are you still with me man?
2009-11-13T04:16:00.000Z	nyk2005	ElNombre	yes, but I'm out of ideas, sorry!
2009-11-13T04:16:00.000Z	ElNombre	nyk2005	don't worry man, thanks for the help :)
