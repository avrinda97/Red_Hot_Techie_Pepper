2005-12-15T10:53:00.000Z	MrBlowtatoes		crono@Knoppix:~$ sudo apt-get install synaptic
2005-12-15T10:53:00.000Z	MrBlowtatoes		E: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
2005-12-15T10:53:00.000Z	MrBlowtatoes		:/
2005-12-15T10:54:00.000Z	MrBlowtatoes		that nano command messed it up even more, not i can't even use apt-get
2005-12-15T10:54:00.000Z	MrBlowtatoes		now*
2005-12-15T10:55:00.000Z	shaggydoo	MrBlowtatoes	are you logged in as root or using sudo apt-get?
2005-12-15T10:55:00.000Z	shaggydoo	MrBlowtatoes	make sure synaptic is closed (or anything of the sort). then if sudo apt-get update still gives you an error, do "sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock"
2005-12-15T10:56:00.000Z	shaggydoo	MrBlowtatoes	scratch that last one, just reboot instead
2005-12-15T10:56:00.000Z	shaggydoo	MrBlowtatoes	reboot and apt will be good as new
2005-12-15T10:57:00.000Z	shaggydoo	MrBlowtatoes	oh fine, just do the "sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock"
2005-12-15T10:58:00.000Z	shaggydoo	MrBlowtatoes	that'll remove the lock for apt. for example, if you end a process and it had a lock, the lock will stay unless you remove it or reboot
2005-12-15T10:58:00.000Z	shaggydoo	MrBlowtatoes	kill 527
2005-12-15T10:59:00.000Z	shaggydoo	MrBlowtatoes	 sudo!
2005-12-15T11:05:00.000Z	shaggydoo	MrBlowtatoes	ctrl-o
2005-12-15T11:06:00.000Z	shaggydoo	MrBlowtatoes	oh vim, I always use nano
