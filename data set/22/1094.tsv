2011-01-14T01:29:00.000Z	KM0201	Phong_	gnome-look.org
2011-01-14T01:30:00.000Z	KM0201	Phong_	just the GUI mostly... but KDE sucks IMO.. :).. they all function pretty much the same
2011-01-14T01:38:00.000Z	KM0201	Phong_	to check an ISO and make sure it is "good"
2011-01-14T01:38:00.000Z	KM0201	Phong_	then thats fine, don't worry about it.
2011-01-14T01:40:00.000Z	KM0201	Phong_	thats a question only you can answer yourself... quit flooding the channel w/ nonsense
2011-06-05T08:01:00.000Z	KM0201	Phong_	whats the chipsets on them... ? my belkin works fine, plug it in, "just works"
2011-06-05T08:07:00.000Z	KM0201	Phong_	thats weird, i think mine is an 8053..
2011-06-05T08:07:00.000Z	KM0201	Phong_	well, yeah..
2011-06-05T08:08:00.000Z	Phong_	KM0201	it keeps on connecting but never connect and failed
2011-06-05T08:08:00.000Z	KM0201	Phong_	have you tried setting you  network to "no security" and seeing if it will connect?
2011-06-05T08:09:00.000Z	Phong_	KM0201	haven't try that yet
2011-06-05T08:12:00.000Z	KM0201	Phong_	i doubt that will work, as it seems to be a driver issue.. it was just a thought.
2011-06-05T08:13:00.000Z	KM0201	Phong_	you really need wired access to fix this problem.
2011-06-05T08:13:00.000Z	Phong_	KM0201	i'll give it a try
