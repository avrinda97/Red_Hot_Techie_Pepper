2008-06-12T01:20:00.000Z	tdela		I have windows xp installed and using my entire HDD, is it possible to partition my pc so I can install ubuntu on this PC for dual booting?
2008-06-12T01:21:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	yes
2008-06-12T01:21:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	the install process will help you repartition
2008-06-12T01:21:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	it uses gparted, open source partitioning program like partition magic
2008-06-12T01:22:00.000Z	tdela	HardDisk	you mean the ubuntu installer will let me slice this sucker in half? amazing.
2008-06-12T01:22:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	yep :)
2008-06-12T01:24:00.000Z	tdela	HardDisk	one more Q, do i need to reboot into the cd or do i partition and install while in windows? I guess i would need to reboot, wouldnt make sense to slice up something in use already.
2008-06-12T01:25:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	you do it when you're installing
2008-06-12T01:25:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	but as you were told defrag first
2008-06-12T03:30:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	I suggest you install virtualbox
2008-06-12T03:30:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	install virtualbox, then install windows in a vm environment, most developers use this method.
2008-06-12T03:31:00.000Z	tdela	HardDisk	oh really? not slow at all?
2008-06-12T03:31:00.000Z	tdela	HardDisk	is it free?
2008-06-12T03:31:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	yes it's free www.virtualbox.org
2008-06-12T03:32:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	if you need USB2.0 support and extra features install the one from sun, the OSE version is in the repo's but is not as feature filled as the regular.
2008-06-12T03:32:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	personally I run 2 vm's one xp and one windows 2003 server
2008-06-12T03:32:00.000Z	tdela	HardDisk	Thanks, I just need photoshop and illustrator though, perhaps visual studio but I can't imagine I'll be doing any C# work anymore.
2008-06-12T03:32:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	the good thing about vm's it won't affect anything else, imagine an OS inside it's own personal bubble anything happens, delete it and start over.
2008-06-12T03:33:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	photoshop CS2 works under wine in ubuntu
2008-06-12T03:33:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	but yes install virtualbox for all those packages
2008-06-12T03:39:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	you're perfect.
2008-06-12T03:42:00.000Z	HardDisk	tdela	or just boot each one and check :)
