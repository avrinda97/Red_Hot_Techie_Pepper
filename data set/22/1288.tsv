2010-09-14T14:41:00.000Z	umc		guys, can anyone please tell me what this error is from ? http://img714.imageshack.us/img714/1277/err1.jpg running ubuntu 10.04.1 64bit
2010-09-14T14:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	that's a kernel panic it looks like
2010-09-14T14:42:00.000Z	umc	tensorpudding	could this be because of hdd or ram failure ? or what causes panics like this usually ?
2010-09-14T14:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	kernel panics are often either broken hardware or broken drivers
2010-09-14T14:43:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	memtest is available from the grub boot menu
2010-09-14T14:44:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	it will usually be near the bottom, after the kernel boot options, with a name like Memory test (memtest86+)
2010-09-14T14:46:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	you can check for filesystem corruption somewhat using smart, assuming your motherboard supports it
2010-09-14T14:46:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	err, hdd corruption
2010-09-14T14:47:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	as for drivers, are you running any proprietary blob drivers?
2010-09-14T14:47:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	S.M.A.R.T., I mean. It's something that does diagnostics on hard drives
2010-09-14T14:47:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	it can be controlled through ubuntu's smart daemon
2010-09-14T14:48:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	if you didn't add any drivers in the after-install process, you won't be
2010-09-14T14:48:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Smartmontools
2010-09-14T14:48:00.000Z	umc	tensorpudding	I use it only as a server, no fancy video drivers, sound, etc. so only the default install stuff
2010-09-14T14:49:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	hmm, in that case it's highly unlikely that it's a driver error
2010-09-14T14:51:00.000Z	umc	tensorpudding	I have SMART support
2010-09-14T14:52:00.000Z	umc	tensorpudding	if I run smartctl, will it disrupt the server's activity ?
2010-09-14T14:52:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	while you're running a test on the drive, it may slighly decrease read/write performance on that drive
2010-09-14T14:53:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	but it doesn't require any special treatment
2010-09-14T14:53:00.000Z	umc	tensorpudding	and one last question, if it's a raid1, can I safely run the test on sda and sdb individually, one after another ?
2010-09-14T15:06:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	sorry, yeah, it should be fine
2010-09-14T15:07:00.000Z	tensorpudding	umc	smart is on a much lower level than software raid
