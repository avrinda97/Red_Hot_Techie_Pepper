2010-04-01T08:27:00.000Z	Orin		Would anyone mind assisting with a bit of an issue? I just installed 9.10 and when it goes into the logon screen, while loading, with the little white scrolling bit, my monitor will turn on for 2 seconds, then turn off and tell me there's no signal.
2010-04-01T08:27:00.000Z	Orin		This it will do forever and not load at all.. :(
2010-04-01T08:27:00.000Z	Orin		Just keeps flashing.
2010-04-01T08:27:00.000Z	Airris	Orin	to clarify : is this before or after you see the option to log in
2010-04-01T08:27:00.000Z	Orin		Before.
2010-04-01T08:27:00.000Z	Airris		or do you just see the loading screen right before that
2010-04-01T08:28:00.000Z	Orin		Loading screen just before it.
2010-04-01T08:28:00.000Z	Airris		I'm having this problem on one of my other linux computers
2010-04-01T08:28:00.000Z	Airris		try this out : hold shift during boot to get to grub
2010-04-01T08:28:00.000Z	Airris		boot into recovery mode
2010-04-01T08:28:00.000Z	Airris		then tell it to do normal boot, you'll be able to log in to a commandline version
2010-04-01T08:28:00.000Z	Airris		from there, type 'startx'
2010-04-01T08:29:00.000Z	Airris		It's a bit of a circular solution, but i haven't been able to figure out what causes that problem
2010-04-01T08:29:00.000Z	Airris		so at the very least you might have a way to log in
2010-04-01T08:29:00.000Z	Airris		this is assuming you're having the same issue
2010-04-01T08:29:00.000Z	Airris		Orin : oh : is your graphics card an onboard chip or something else that's a sufficiently non-common piece of hardware?
2010-04-01T08:30:00.000Z	Orin		On-board.
2010-04-01T08:30:00.000Z	Airris		Ah yea. I think you have the same issue
2010-04-01T08:30:00.000Z	Airris		whatever it is
2010-04-01T08:31:00.000Z	Airris		Orin : do that sequence i said. It should work. For me it also will allow the computer to boot normally the next couple times before reverting to being screwy
2010-04-01T08:32:00.000Z	Airris		Btw : can anyone read up and solve Orin's problem? I have no clue what's going on with that, but it was bothering me too a while back (I have a couple linux computers, and that's the current problem on *that* one. The question I keep asking tonight is for my laptop)
2010-04-01T08:32:00.000Z	Orin	Airris	thanks. That worked...
