2005-05-12T16:36:00.000Z	Shadow_Rage		simple fix
2005-05-12T16:36:00.000Z	MightyF	Shadow_Rage	no, its not.
2005-05-12T16:37:00.000Z	MightyF	Shadow_Rage	because ESD is still hogging the device, you need to get it to let it go when its not using it
2005-05-12T16:38:00.000Z	Shadow_Rage	MightyF	oh, a non-duplex soundcard?
2005-05-12T16:38:00.000Z	MightyF	Shadow_Rage	maybe, heh
2005-05-12T16:38:00.000Z	MightyF	Shadow_Rage	I just use what came with my mobo
2005-05-12T16:38:00.000Z	Shadow_Rage	MightyF	is it a cirrus logic?
2005-05-12T16:38:00.000Z	MightyF	Shadow_Rage	must be your sound card
2005-05-12T16:38:00.000Z	MightyF	Shadow_Rage	no
2005-05-12T16:39:00.000Z	MightyF	Shadow_Rage	check out this, #3: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RestrictedFormats
2005-05-12T16:40:00.000Z	MightyF	Shadow_Rage	rafael, I'm going back to my Security labs, I have tons to do, good luck on all that
2005-05-12T16:40:00.000Z	Shadow_Rage	MightyF	soundblaster cards multiplex, and so do terratecs, low end sound cards only allow one stream of audio to go into them
2005-05-12T16:40:00.000Z	Shadow_Rage	MightyF	so go with a soundblaster live, you can grab the 5.1's for under $30 these days
2005-05-12T16:41:00.000Z	MightyF	Shadow_Rage	no thanks, problem is already solved and I don't need that kind of sound quality
2005-05-12T16:53:00.000Z	MightyF	Shadow_Rage	Maybe esd is hogging the sound? ;P
2005-05-12T16:53:00.000Z	Shadow_Rage	MightyF	...huh?
2005-05-12T16:53:00.000Z	Shadow_Rage	MightyF	no, I can play oggs.
2005-05-12T16:53:00.000Z	MightyF	Shadow_Rage	gstreamer thing, lol
2005-05-12T16:53:00.000Z	MightyF	Shadow_Rage	;P
2005-05-12T16:54:00.000Z	Shadow_Rage	MightyF	mp3's won't play at all
2005-05-12T16:54:00.000Z	MightyF	Shadow_Rage	the ;P means i'm joking in a teasing way
