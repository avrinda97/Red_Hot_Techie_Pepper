2005-07-11T11:18:00.000Z	vladuz976		how do you search for packages with apt-get?
2005-07-11T11:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladuz976	 use apt-cache search
2005-10-03T10:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladuz976	 yes.
2005-10-03T10:02:00.000Z	vladuz976	Dr_Willis	where can i find out what repos i can add to my sources. list in breezy?
2005-10-03T10:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladuz976	 the .bashrc will read /etc/profile if its told to do so. (like   source /etc/profile)
2005-10-03T10:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladuz976	 thers also the .bash_profile
2005-10-03T10:46:00.000Z	vladuz976	Dr_Willis	so how come, edititng the PATH in /etc/profile has no effect?
2005-10-03T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladuz976	 it had an effect for me i think.. grep the files in /etc/ see what others are setting the path.
2005-10-03T10:50:00.000Z	vladuz976	Dr_Willis	PATH=~/bin:"${PATH}" change it to PATH=/opt/e17/bin:~/bin:"${PATH}" in .bash_profile if i wanna include /opt/e17/bin to my path?
2005-10-03T10:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladuz976	 well you need to EXPORT it.
2005-10-03T10:51:00.000Z	vladuz976	Dr_Willis	but then it will only stay for this terminal, next time i log in it's gone
2006-02-20T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladuz976	 it will proberly be said to not use either one. :P
2006-02-20T10:28:00.000Z	vladuz976	Dr_Willis	how come?
2006-02-20T10:28:00.000Z	vladuz976	Dr_Willis	on the forum they praise it
2006-02-20T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladuz976	 they can do a lot of things - and can break things
2006-02-20T10:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladuz976	 its 'best' to learn what they are doing and do the steps yourself. noting they do is that fancy.
2006-02-20T10:35:00.000Z	vladuz976	Dr_Willis	the codecs easyubuntu installs. where else can i get those from?
2006-02-20T10:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladuz976	 could check the Mplayer homepage - they have several collections
2006-03-31T11:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladuz976	 use the Dvi/digital if your video card supports it. Better picture.
2006-03-31T11:18:00.000Z	vladuz976	Dr_Willis	noticalble difference? is it worth the extra money?
2006-03-31T11:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladuz976	 in short YES yes Yes!
2006-03-31T11:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vladuz976	 :P
