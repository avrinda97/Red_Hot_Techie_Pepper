2011-09-11T08:34:00.000Z	excelsior1979		any good tutorials on setting up a multiple install USB?
2011-09-11T08:36:00.000Z	fermulator	excelsior1979	unetbootin <-- a program to load up ISOs, bootable, on USB keys
2011-09-11T08:37:00.000Z	excelsior1979		can it do multiple installs from one USB?
2011-09-11T08:37:00.000Z	excelsior1979		stick
2011-09-11T08:38:00.000Z	excelsior1979		tutorial link please?
2011-09-11T08:38:00.000Z	fermulator	excelsior1979	it only supports one from the GUI, i've wanted to do it for a while myself, yes qin -- would be awesome if you have info on that

2011-09-11T08:40:00.000Z	excelsior1979		It would be sweet if I could install every flavor of Ubuntu from a single USB, plus other select Linuxes...
2011-09-11T08:41:00.000Z	fermulator		qin/excelsior1979: clarification, are we trying to install multiple OSs onto a USB key, or have available multiple ISOs for booting to install OSs?
2011-09-11T08:41:00.000Z	excelsior1979		But what about the 32 bit v 64 bit?
2011-09-11T08:41:00.000Z	excelsior1979		I don't trust Windows with my USB.
2011-09-11T08:43:00.000Z	fermulator	excelsior1979	yes, that's what i'd like to do as well, have a "library" of installers on a single USB key (and you can pick which one to install .. Ubuntu desktop, Ubuntu alternate, Ubuntu server, 32-bit/64-bit, LTS, latest, etc.
2011-09-11T08:43:00.000Z	fermulator		theoretically once unetbootin does one, we should be able to easily augment the files to just add more ISOs to the file system, but I haven't had time to fiddle with it yet
2011-09-11T08:44:00.000Z	excelsior1979		I'm in Ubuntu right now
2011-09-11T08:45:00.000Z	excelsior1979		;) I'm trying to get a work computer to use Ubuntu. Everything here is sucky hardware. Which is why this tower requires an external dvd drive
2011-09-11T08:46:00.000Z	excelsior1979		ooh, gotta go sing happy birthday!
2011-09-11T08:47:00.000Z	fermulator		I've forgotten how to do this; in Ubuntu, 11.04, how to disable the Restart/Shutdown/Login confirmation prompt?
2011-09-11T08:48:00.000Z	fermulator		oh here it is apps > indicator-session >
2011-09-11T08:48:00.000Z	fermulator		> suppress_logout_restart_shutdown
