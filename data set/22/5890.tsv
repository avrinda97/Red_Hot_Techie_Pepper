2007-09-01T12:00:00.000Z	wolferine	GTroy	whats using the sound ?
2007-09-01T12:01:00.000Z	wolferine	GTroy	keep it to one line?
2007-09-01T12:01:00.000Z	wolferine	GTroy	have you tried to 'adjust' sound in alsamixer ?
2007-09-01T12:03:00.000Z	wolferine	GTroy	so you have multiple sound cards ?
2007-09-01T12:03:00.000Z	wolferine	GTroy	so is one not working, and the other is working ?
2007-09-01T12:04:00.000Z	wolferine	GTroy	what are you trying to listen to your audio in, one app is fine..
2007-09-01T12:05:00.000Z	wolferine	GTroy	can you configure which device handles your sound in that app ?
2007-09-01T12:06:00.000Z	wolferine	GTroy	pastebin the command lspci please
2007-09-01T12:08:00.000Z	GTroy	wolferine	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35883/
2007-09-01T12:08:00.000Z	wolferine	GTroy	so, are you able to do what I said ?
2007-09-01T12:09:00.000Z	wolferine	GTroy	then perhaps you might want to use an app you can configure
2007-09-01T12:10:00.000Z	GTroy	wolferine	I'll try vlc
2007-09-01T12:10:00.000Z	wolferine	GTroy	what do you currently have setup in vlc as the device ?
2007-09-01T12:11:00.000Z	GTroy	wolferine	nothing...just default
2007-09-01T12:11:00.000Z	wolferine	GTroy	is there a list to choose from ?
2007-09-01T12:12:00.000Z	wolferine	GTroy	maybe pick the device you want to work ?
2007-09-01T12:12:00.000Z	wolferine	GTroy	Audio->output modules->alsa
