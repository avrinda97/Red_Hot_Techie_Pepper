2008-02-20T22:42:00.000Z	Cew27		hey every one does anybody know how effective the wipe nautilus script is
2008-02-20T22:42:00.000Z	aoupi	Cew27	I recommend you use encryption for secret stuff
2008-02-20T22:43:00.000Z	Cew27	aoupi	wow this is awkward talking about this, anyhoo is it sucre using hte wipe script
2008-02-20T22:44:00.000Z	aoupi	Cew27	http://abaababa.ouvaton.org/wipe/wipe.1.html see important warning section
2008-02-20T22:44:00.000Z	aoupi	Cew27	"Wiping over NFS or over a journalling filesystem (ReiserFS etc.) will most probably not work" that part in particular, since I assume you use either ReiserFS or ext3, both being journaled
2008-02-20T22:45:00.000Z	aoupi	Cew27	soo encryption is the way to go
2008-02-20T22:45:00.000Z	Cew27	aoupi	thats it will it work with ubunt
2008-02-20T22:56:00.000Z	aoupi	Cew27	you're welcome
2008-02-20T22:48:00.000Z	aoupi	Cew27	you can do it from the ubuntu livecd, just run "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda1" replace sda1 with the partition you want wiped
2008-02-20T22:48:00.000Z	aoupi	Cew27	that will erase EVERYTHING on that partition
2008-02-20T22:51:00.000Z	aoupi	Cew27	they wont care about cracked software if that is all you are hiding
2008-02-20T22:52:00.000Z	Cew27	aoupi	*shifty look*
2008-02-20T22:52:00.000Z	aoupi	Cew27	and even if they do it will be enough with just normal delete
2008-02-20T22:53:00.000Z	Cew27	aoupi	im also selling an external hdd wich had a text file on it with log ins for many sites how can i wipe this? will boot and nuke be ok
2008-02-20T22:53:00.000Z	aoupi	Cew27	selling your HD, yes then you really should wipe it clean

2008-02-20T22:55:00.000Z	aoupi	Cew27	but in the future I recommend you encrypt personal/secret things soo you don't have to worry
2008-02-20T22:56:00.000Z	Cew27	aoupi	thaks for all the help people!
