2010-02-06T23:47:00.000Z	lenina		hi, why do these messages keep coming up in my /var/log/auth.log, even if i didn't sudo ? http://pastebin.com/m54e212a8
2010-02-06T23:49:00.000Z	ermac0	lenina	those messages show when you login as root on your local machine
2010-02-06T23:49:00.000Z	ermac0	lenina	auth.log tracks samba logins and pam logins
2010-02-06T23:50:00.000Z	lenina	ermac0	i don't have samba. what are pam logins ?
2010-02-06T23:51:00.000Z	ermac0	lenina	pam is what you use to login to your ubuntu session
2010-02-06T23:52:00.000Z	ermac0	lenina	if you didn't make that login , IE through a terminal window, then some program must have root access to login ..perhaps a script, but a user and only a user should know what runs on the machine
2010-02-06T23:54:00.000Z	lenina	ermac0	ok - this is strange, there are lots of these mesagges, but when i try to grep the process via ps aux, it shows nothing. there are several pid's and i tried a lot of them
2010-02-06T23:56:00.000Z	ermac0	lenina	you will not find the PID for it, because it opens and closes to fast
2010-02-06T23:57:00.000Z	lenina	ermac0	allright, but what is the explanation ?
2010-02-06T23:58:00.000Z	ermac0	lenina	if your worried do a who -a and kill any root sessions that are active.
2010-02-06T23:59:00.000Z	lenina	ermac0	no root session is open.. i'm worried because yesterday some guy tried to break in via ssh. and now there are lots of root logins i don't understand..
2010-02-07T00:01:00.000Z	lenina	ermac0	is there any secure option to check for backdoors, etc ?
2010-02-07T00:01:00.000Z	ermac0	lenina	make sure you have a strong password other than that you need a strong firewall, there will always be people that lurk in the broadcast ranges of ISP's
2010-02-07T00:02:00.000Z	ermac0	lenina	you could make sure you have ufw installed
2010-02-07T00:02:00.000Z	lenina	ermac0	it's installed, but doesn't seem to run oO
2010-02-07T00:04:00.000Z	ermac0	lenina	ufw status will tell you
2010-02-07T00:04:00.000Z	lenina	ermac0	i did sudo ufw enable and it shows this: http://pastebin.com/m55dfe7f9
2010-02-07T00:05:00.000Z	ermac0	lenina	try again
2010-02-07T00:06:00.000Z	ermac0	lenina	do ufw status first
2010-02-07T00:07:00.000Z	lenina	ermac0	ufw status said it was disabled
2010-02-07T00:08:00.000Z	ermac0	lenina	yea thats not good. enableing will good
2010-02-07T00:10:00.000Z	lenina	ermac0	i did that and this was the output: http://pastebin.com/m55dfe7f9
