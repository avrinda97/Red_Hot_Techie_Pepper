2011-08-26T22:00:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	LiranV	librarian-user01 fstab
2011-08-26T22:01:00.000Z	LiranV	[THC]AcidRain	in previous installation i didn't need to touch fstab... my dok just mounted itself automatically
2011-08-26T22:01:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	LiranV	but like anything. the more advanced it gets, the more problems you will have out of it
2011-08-26T22:02:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	LiranV	i had the same issue. i just had to modify fstab for my needs. and it works perfect now
2011-08-26T22:02:00.000Z	LiranV	[THC]AcidRain	im talking about the same ubuntu version..
2011-08-26T22:02:00.000Z	LiranV	[THC]AcidRain	it worked before
2011-08-26T22:02:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	LiranV	have you hooked your drive up to a windows computer lately?
2011-08-26T22:03:00.000Z	LiranV	[THC]AcidRain	i had 11.04 then linux mint 11 then yesterday installed 11.04 again and it doesn't work..
2011-08-26T22:03:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	LiranV	sounds like the permissions got changed. have you checked permission on the drive?
2011-08-26T22:04:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	LiranV	thats my main issue, everytime i hook my drive up to a windows computer, i have to manually change its permissions again. just so my box will mount it. regardless if i use fstab or not
2011-08-26T22:05:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	LiranV	open up a terminal. goto cd /dev/sdb1
2011-08-26T22:06:00.000Z	LiranV	[THC]AcidRain	copy what?
2011-08-26T22:08:00.000Z	LiranV	[THC]AcidRain	brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 49 2011-08-26 19:39 /dev/sdd1
2011-08-26T22:08:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	LiranV	and see, there is your problem
2011-08-26T22:09:00.000Z	LiranV	[THC]AcidRain	using "chown"?
2011-08-26T22:10:00.000Z	LiranV	[THC]AcidRain	but why it happens in the fist place? it wans't happening to me before with mint 11 or my last ubuntu install
2011-08-26T22:11:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	LiranV	my guess is that when you changed to mint, you ran something as sudo, and it changed the permission on the drive.
2011-08-26T22:12:00.000Z	LiranV	[THC]AcidRain	let me try that
2011-08-26T22:13:00.000Z	LiranV	[THC]AcidRain	it works!! youre the man... but I don't understant somthing
2011-08-26T22:13:00.000Z	LiranV	[THC]AcidRain	everything i plug can be sdd1... so how this permission work?
2011-08-26T22:14:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	LiranV	at this point. i would extract its uuid, and add that to fstab
2011-08-26T22:14:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	LiranV	you will also need to know the filesystem
