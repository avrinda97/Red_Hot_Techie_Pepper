2006-12-24T06:01:00.000Z	Death_Rider		hey
2006-12-24T06:01:00.000Z	Death_Rider		:)
2006-12-24T06:02:00.000Z	Death_Rider		i'm new to Linux, and Ubuntu, and i wanted to know, what SWAP is?
2006-12-24T06:02:00.000Z	Death_Rider		dunno :/
2006-12-24T06:02:00.000Z	Death_Rider		i've still got Windows and i want to find out as much as posible about linux
2006-12-24T06:03:00.000Z	Death_Rider		well what i know is that swap needs to be bigger then my ram
2006-12-24T06:04:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	roughly double of your ram.  in any case if you have a large hd say 40 gig plus  no harm in setting swap to be 2 gigs
2006-12-24T06:05:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	depends on your needs, the problem is that the installer will try to repartition your hd if windows is occupies all of the hd
2006-12-24T06:07:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	i would try it out and see what you like
2006-12-24T06:07:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	remember a couple of things:
2006-12-24T06:09:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	to be perfectly honest, i would invest in removable trays for your hds
2006-12-24T06:11:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	is this your first time installing linux?
2006-12-24T06:12:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	welcome to the dark side btw
2006-12-24T06:14:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	 no you should use a separate hd for linux
2006-12-24T06:14:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	you haveto be VERY careful with windows
2006-12-24T06:15:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	second, you haveto have windows installed first, then install ubuntu and grub boot manager (automaticly done for you)
2006-12-24T06:16:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	ah i misread :) yes less chance of messing up your windows stuff
2006-12-24T06:18:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	well the thing because drive 1 (windows) is going to be master
2006-12-24T06:19:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	yes, just the bootloader
2006-12-24T06:19:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	you can restore the bootloader for windows via windows restore disk
2006-12-24T06:20:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	if you had removable trays yep thats what you would do
2006-12-24T06:20:00.000Z	holycow	Death_Rider	its a great way to learn, it really keeps you safe, although its a bit of work to set it up at first
