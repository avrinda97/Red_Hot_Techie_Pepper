2008-08-28T22:19:00.000Z	CBprog		elusive, thanks that worked. do you know of any more packages that are up for downloads that may not be included in ubuntu which contain libraries for C++, DX, OpenGL, etc ? random question I know
2008-08-28T22:20:00.000Z	CBprog		does anyone know of any packages that contain the C++ libraries, or DirectX libraries, or OpenGL libraries?
2008-08-28T22:21:00.000Z	joaopinto	CBprog	opengl libraries are not on the opengl dev package, directx is not available on Linux
2008-08-28T22:22:00.000Z	CBprog	joaopinto	do you know if I download the libraries online, they will work on linux?
2008-08-28T22:22:00.000Z	joaopinto	CBprog	sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
2008-08-28T22:22:00.000Z	CBprog	joaopinto	thanks
2008-08-28T22:22:00.000Z	joaopinto	CBprog	before trying to develop on Ubuntu, you should learn to install software on it ;)
2008-08-28T22:23:00.000Z	CBprog	joaopinto	haha yea very true :P i'm new to linux though so i'm trying to get my programming set up here so i can prog elsewhere besides windows
2008-08-28T22:24:00.000Z	CBprog	joaopinto	i'm thinking the best IDE available for C++ is anjuta so I should just stick to programming within the terminal or ?? do you program?
2008-08-28T22:24:00.000Z	joaopinto	CBprog	I would recommend code::blocks
2008-08-28T22:25:00.000Z	CBprog	joaopinto	code::blocks ? i guess tha'd be another sudo apt-get install command ? or should i just sudo apt-cache search for that one?
2008-08-28T22:25:00.000Z	joaopinto	CBprog	I am not sure code blocks is arealdy on the repos, but you should be able to find a repository for it somewhere
2008-08-28T22:26:00.000Z	CBprog	joaopinto	i searched for it after doing an update to the cache but it didn't return anything for code::blocks
2008-08-28T22:26:00.000Z	CBprog	joaopinto	so i'll google it haha
2008-08-28T22:26:00.000Z	joaopinto	CBprog	http://www.getdeb.net/app/code::blocks
2008-08-28T22:27:00.000Z	CBprog	joaopinto	thanks bro
2008-08-28T22:28:00.000Z	CBprog	joaopinto	hmmm i think i'll install both then
2008-08-28T22:44:00.000Z	joaopinto	CBprog	the libraries are not installed with the IDE
2008-08-28T22:44:00.000Z	CBprog	joaopinto	such is life
2008-08-28T22:44:00.000Z	CBprog	joaopinto	so now the next question is... where can I find the libraries? haha
2008-08-28T22:45:00.000Z	joaopinto	CBprog	I already told you for the opengl case
2008-08-28T22:45:00.000Z	CBprog	joaopinto	yea i got those for sure, C++ though i'm not finding.... maybe i'll stick to codeblocks for C++?
