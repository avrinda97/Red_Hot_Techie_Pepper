2010-02-05T13:32:00.000Z	Myrtti	ae86-drifter_	we don't?
2010-02-05T13:33:00.000Z	Myrtti	ae86-drifter_	this channel just happens to be for ubuntu support only.
2010-02-05T13:34:00.000Z	Myrtti	ae86-drifter_	this is the place where the users come for help for their problems, not to discuss the difference of debian and ubuntu and who did what. Please join #ubuntu-offtopic if you've got a passion of discussing the matt4er
2010-02-05T13:34:00.000Z	ae86-drifter_	Myrtti	sorry, but i do have a serious problem with my laptop
2010-02-05T13:35:00.000Z	Myrtti	ae86-drifter_	looking at lastlog you've not asked yet, so let's hear it and perhaps we can help you with it
2010-02-05T13:36:00.000Z	ae86-drifter_	Myrtti	it has (had) dual boot with windows 7 and karmic, i was using windows to play games and updated a few drivers etc.... next reboot it will give GRUB ERROR
2010-02-05T13:36:00.000Z	Myrtti	ae86-drifter_	do you remember which grub error it gave?
2010-02-05T13:36:00.000Z	Myrtti	ae86-drifter_	the errors usually have error 15 or error 17 or similar
2010-02-05T13:37:00.000Z	ae86-drifter_	Myrtti	no i do not sorry, but i booted into a live CD and Gparted showed my ext4 partition as Unallocated!
2010-02-05T13:38:00.000Z	Myrtti	ae86-drifter_	wow. I'm guessing the error would have been 17 then, cannot locate system disc or similar...
2010-02-05T13:38:00.000Z	ae86-drifter_	Myrtti	i think it was file not found or something
2010-02-05T13:38:00.000Z	ae86-drifter_	Myrtti	so windows 7 just likes to kill linux partitions for no real reason..
2010-02-05T13:39:00.000Z	Myrtti	ae86-drifter_	yeah, well, I'm not surprised by anything that OS does.
2010-02-05T13:40:00.000Z	ae86-drifter_	Myrtti	i managed to recover it from a windows program, but in the process, my NTFS partition now shows unallocated in gparted
2010-02-05T13:40:00.000Z	Myrtti	ae86-drifter_	X-(
2010-02-05T13:41:00.000Z	ae86-drifter_	Myrtti	how can i fix it?
2010-02-05T13:41:00.000Z	ae86-drifter_	Myrtti	i have important data save games on my NTFS partition
2010-02-05T13:44:00.000Z	Myrtti	ae86-drifter_	I'm not too familiar with ntfs, I moved to Ubuntu before I got to know Windows and its filesystems too well
2010-02-05T13:44:00.000Z	ae86-drifter_	Myrtti	is there an issue with ext4?
2010-02-05T13:44:00.000Z	Myrtti	ae86-drifter_	there's a fair chance that gparted shows the partitions a bit wonky though.
2010-02-05T13:44:00.000Z	ae86-drifter_	Myrtti	i checked fdisk , and it always showed the same
