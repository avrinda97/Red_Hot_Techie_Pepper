2009-07-26T03:07:00.000Z	mido1		cliff: We'll need some more details.
2009-07-26T03:07:00.000Z	cliffbreaker	mido1	ok, tell me what kind of details you will need
2009-07-26T03:09:00.000Z	cliffbreaker	mido1	no, winxp occupied 30 GB and worked well, after that i repartitioned all space except winxp partition and it stopped booting although I can boot in linux
2009-07-26T03:13:00.000Z	cliffbreaker	mido1	yes I do
2009-07-26T03:14:00.000Z	cliffbreaker	mido1	what other options can I use?
2009-07-26T03:16:00.000Z	cliffbreaker	mido1	and can I do smth about it from linux? i have correct entry in menu.lst
2009-07-26T03:17:00.000Z	mido1	cliffbreaker	just a moment...
2009-07-26T03:18:00.000Z	mido1	cliffbreaker	In the section for booting windows xp in your menu.lst, what is the line starting with "root" or "rootnoverify"?
2009-07-26T03:20:00.000Z	cliffbreaker	mido1	rootnoverify
2009-07-26T03:20:00.000Z	mido1	cliffbreaker	That's all, nothing behind "rootnoverify"?
2009-07-26T03:21:00.000Z	cliffbreaker	mido1	also (hd0,0) in this line
2009-07-26T03:21:00.000Z	mido1	cliffbreaker	Ah, that's very important :-)
2009-07-26T03:22:00.000Z	cliffbreaker	mido1	yes, you're right
2009-07-26T03:22:00.000Z	mido1	cliffbreaker	Hmmm, then the entry seems to be okay.
2009-07-26T03:23:00.000Z	cliffbreaker	mido1	sure it's ok
2009-07-26T03:23:00.000Z	cliffbreaker	mido1	ok, what can I do about it without demolishing grub?
2009-07-26T03:24:00.000Z	mido1	cliffbreaker	I would suggest booting the install cd, using rescue mode, and then write a new bootsector via "fixboot" as next step
2009-07-26T03:24:00.000Z	mido1	cliffbreaker	Then grub should be able to boot windows again.
2009-07-26T03:25:00.000Z	cliffbreaker	mido1	well, not sure how to do it
2009-07-26T03:26:00.000Z	mido1	cliffbreaker	Just boot from your windows install cd.
2009-07-26T03:26:00.000Z	mido1	cliffbreaker	on the big blue screen, you're asked if you would like to install, or enter rescue mode.
2009-07-26T03:28:00.000Z	cliffbreaker	mido1	will I have to reinstall grub?
