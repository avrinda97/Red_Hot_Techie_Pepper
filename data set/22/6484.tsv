2007-06-20T14:53:00.000Z	livingdaylight		Guys: I am hoping someone can help me with wireless issue here.
2007-06-20T14:53:00.000Z	livingdaylight		 I was running wireless fantastic on my feisty box... but when i upgrade to ubuntustudio by adding the repos.. it broke my wireless and now i don't know how to enable it
2007-06-20T14:54:00.000Z	livingdaylight		iwconfig wlan0 essid linksys key *********** mode managed this was my command to connect to wireless using wlan0 and now it says it doesn't exist
2007-06-20T14:54:00.000Z	livingdaylight		Error for wireless request "Set ESSID" (8B1A) :  SET failed on device wlan0 ; No such device
2007-06-20T14:54:00.000Z	nimbo	livingdaylight	what does iwconfig say
2007-06-20T14:56:00.000Z	livingdaylight	nimbo	output: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26378/
2007-06-20T14:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight	nimbo	i never had the vmnet1 and vmnet8 before... ubutustudio broke my wirelss with their hacked kernel
2007-06-20T14:57:00.000Z	nimbo	livingdaylight	what is ubuntustudio
2007-06-20T14:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight	nimbo	i thought it was ubuntu+multimedia package + look
2007-06-20T14:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight	nimbo	http://www.ubuntustudio.org/
2007-06-20T14:59:00.000Z	livingdaylight	nimbo	one can add ubuntustudio repos to source.list and add ubuntustudio to desktop that way, which is how i did it, but it broke my wireless in the process
2007-06-20T15:00:00.000Z	nimbo	livingdaylight	does it modify the kernel?
2007-06-20T15:00:00.000Z	livingdaylight	nimbo	precisely
2007-06-20T15:00:00.000Z	nimbo		well, that is the problem then
2007-06-20T15:01:00.000Z	livingdaylight	nimbo	lol, i know but can it be fixed?
2007-06-20T15:01:00.000Z	nimbo		hm ... well i dunno if there is an easy way
2007-06-20T15:01:00.000Z	nimbo		get the kernel sources, recompile it with your wifi-drivers and there you go
2007-06-20T15:01:00.000Z	livingdaylight	nimbo	i don't mind as long as there is a way...
2007-06-20T15:02:00.000Z	livingdaylight	nimbo	lol...yea, right..... i can just about switch a computer on dude
2007-06-20T15:02:00.000Z	nimbo		hm too bad ^^
2007-06-20T15:02:00.000Z	nimbo		then send a bug report @ubuntustudio or so
2007-06-20T15:02:00.000Z	livingdaylight	nimbo	is this a regular thing everyone can do... recompile kernels with wifi drivers???
