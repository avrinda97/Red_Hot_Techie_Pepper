2008-09-03T23:52:00.000Z	nandemonai	Uplink	could be any number of things, something in session, too many apps in session, bad .gnome conf etc etc
2008-09-03T23:52:00.000Z	Uplink	nandemonai	hmmm i see a stupid search index load everytime i load up my ubuntu... i never use it :/
2008-09-03T23:53:00.000Z	nandemonai	Uplink	ah that would likely be the culprit. You can disable it I think..
2008-09-03T23:53:00.000Z	Uplink	nandemonai	what is that for?
2008-09-03T23:54:00.000Z	nandemonai	Uplink	it indexes your files for quick searching through tracker.
2008-09-03T23:55:00.000Z	Uplink	nandemonai	i meant if its necessary?
2008-09-03T23:55:00.000Z	nandemonai	Uplink	I'm pretty sure if you turn indexing off the tracker tool wont work so you might not be able to search for files in gnome. Not too sure.
2008-09-03T23:56:00.000Z	nandemonai	Uplink	honestly though I wouldn't turn it off..
2008-09-03T23:56:00.000Z	nandemonai	Uplink	it shouldn't be slowing down the system too much.
2008-09-03T23:56:00.000Z	Uplink	nandemonai	lOl ok mate thanx... so what can i do? :( i wanna speed up my startup screen... after i input my username and password it takes longer than usual before to load the desktop
2008-09-03T23:57:00.000Z	nandemonai	Uplink	it could be something else slowing it down. You could always try resetting gnome. Assuming your using gnome that is.
2008-09-03T23:59:00.000Z	Uplink	nandemonai	how can i reset my gnome?
