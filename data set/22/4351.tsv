2008-11-04T01:34:00.000Z	arun_		any idea how to get my default resolution to 1400x900 on hp s7712n desktop which has an intel 945GM card, i run intrepid. All I get is 1024x768
2008-11-04T01:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arun_	you need the 945 resolution package
2008-11-04T01:35:00.000Z	arun_	ActionParsnip	let me see if I can find it..thank you so much for giving me that clue
2008-11-04T01:36:00.000Z	arun_	ActionParsnip	is it still part of the repository. I cant seem to find it
2008-11-04T01:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arun_	did you try tab completing?
2008-11-04T01:40:00.000Z	arun_	ActionParsnip	 I did, they are saying tht they removed the 915resolution from intrepid and 945resolution does not exist
2008-11-04T01:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arun_	not sure, i always buy nvidia for simplicity
2008-11-04T01:42:00.000Z	arun_	ActionParsnip	what does this mean "Package 915resolution is not available, but is referred to by another package."
2008-12-02T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arun_	use sudo -i instead
2008-12-02T13:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arun_	you'd need sudo su, but sudo -i is advised
2008-12-02T13:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arun_	interactive, i'm just passing on what the ops tell folks
2008-12-02T13:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arun_	you should just sudo each command
2008-12-03T04:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arun_	id run fluxbox / xfce for lightness, ram is cheap though :)
2008-12-03T04:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arun_	its a window manager, the default window manager for ubuntu is metacity
2008-12-03T04:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arun_	the default in kde is kwin
2008-12-03T04:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arun_	you could install ubuntu, then sudo apt-get install fluxbox and change your session type to fluxbox, same apps, lighter frontend
2008-12-03T04:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arun_	you will have all the gnome apps, just that you will use them via fluxbox instead of metacity
2008-12-03T04:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arun_	its the same OS, just different apps installed by default
2008-12-03T04:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arun_	not much, if anything
