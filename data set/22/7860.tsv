2007-09-26T14:53:00.000Z	macd	darkangel	  yeah, its in main so it shouldnt need any modifications to sources.list
2007-09-26T15:27:00.000Z	macd	darkangel	what happens when you do 'sudo apt-get install linux-source'
2007-09-26T15:29:00.000Z	macd	darkangel	what release are you on?
2007-09-26T15:31:00.000Z	macd	darkangel	and you have already don 'sudo apt-get update' recently? linux-source is in main, so your default sources.list should be fine to get this package.
2007-09-26T15:32:00.000Z	macd	darkangel	it never finished the update?
2007-09-26T15:35:00.000Z	macd	darkangel	just goto http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/devel/linux-source-2.6.20 and download it.

2007-09-26T15:55:00.000Z	macd	darkangel	in case you cant find the download link http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-source-2.6.20/linux-source-2.6.20_2.6.20-16.32_all.deb
2007-09-26T15:55:00.000Z	macd	darkangel	then sudo dpkg -i linux-source-2.6.20/linux-source-2.6.20_2.6.20-16.32_all.deb
2007-09-26T16:03:00.000Z	macd	darkangel	I gave you the URL 3 times.
2007-09-27T16:04:00.000Z	macd	darkangel	in case you cant find the download link http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-source-2.6.20/linux-source-2.6.20_2.6.20-16.32_all.deb  then right click the package on your desktop and install it.
