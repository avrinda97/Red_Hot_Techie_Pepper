2005-03-06T09:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Abusive	OK you have Warty :)
2005-03-06T09:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Abusive	try typing apt-cache search mysql (you have universe repo enabled?)
2005-03-06T09:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Abusive	yes, #mysql sounds a good plan
2005-03-06T09:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Abusive	don't know exactly what you want : what about mysqlcc - The official GUI interface for MySQL
2005-03-06T09:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Abusive	it isn't in warty
2005-03-06T09:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Abusive	probably under a different name
2005-03-06T09:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Abusive	of course you can - it just requires you find out how
2005-03-06T09:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Abusive	have you enabled the universe repository?
2005-03-06T09:22:00.000Z	Abusive	thoreauputic	: how?
