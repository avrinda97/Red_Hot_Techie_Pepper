2006-07-31T15:45:00.000Z	DJAdmiral		I have a Compaq Presario Laptop, and to the best of my knowledge, it has an ATI Rage Mobility 128 video card with 8 megs of VRAM. How do I find out if Ubuntu works with my video card?
2006-07-31T15:45:00.000Z	sehute	DJAdmiral	google
2006-07-31T15:45:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	sehute	thank you, i'll try that now
2006-07-31T15:46:00.000Z	sehute	DJAdmiral	yw (I think it works with Ubuntu, as far as I can recall)
2006-07-31T15:52:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	sehute	darth_gimp: don't you just love dosbox?
2006-07-31T15:52:00.000Z	sehute	DJAdmiral	It's amazing. I love it :)
2006-07-31T15:52:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	sehute	lovely. Have you tried the other DOS Emulator though?
2006-07-31T15:55:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	sehute	between running SCUMM based dos games on DOSBOX and SCUMM based games in SCUMMVM, what would you go for?
2006-07-31T15:55:00.000Z	sehute	DJAdmiral	I would run Scumm based games in Scumm - it works smoother :)
2006-07-31T15:56:00.000Z	sehute	DJAdmiral	And I've tried dosemu a year or two ago. It worked okay, but not for old games and graphical applications
2006-07-31T15:56:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	sehute	that's what I thought - what SCUMM games do you have at the mo?
2006-07-31T15:56:00.000Z	sehute	DJAdmiral	:)
2006-07-31T15:57:00.000Z	sehute	DJAdmiral	I've got Beneath a Steel Sky and Queen of the Amazone Jungle...
2006-07-31T15:57:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	sehute	don't you mean flight of the amazon queen?
2006-07-31T15:57:00.000Z	sehute	DJAdmiral	but I've heard rumors of a very nice torrent that includes all the games in one huge package... ;)
2006-07-31T15:57:00.000Z	sehute	DJAdmiral	yeah, that one
2006-07-31T15:58:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	sehute	torrent? i have to look now!! :P

2006-07-31T15:58:00.000Z	sehute	DJAdmiral	monkey island 2 is a fantastic game, but I guess we're getting offtopic now ;)
2006-07-31T15:59:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	sehute	right then, im installing cedega atm, i need to get some more packages, eg. flex, bison
2006-07-31T16:00:00.000Z	sehute	DJAdmiral	well, I've never installed cedega
