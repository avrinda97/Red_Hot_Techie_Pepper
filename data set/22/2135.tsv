2010-04-23T13:15:00.000Z	theadmin		packages.ubuntu.com is horrible :/ Hardly could make any sense of what depends on what
2010-04-23T13:16:00.000Z	azlon	theadmin	thats the same problem i had. i looked at packages.ubuntu.com and had to open like 40 tabs just to make sure i got all the dependencies
2010-04-23T13:18:00.000Z	theadmin	azlon	Listen to what this guy says. You'll ruin your system.
2010-04-23T13:19:00.000Z	theadmin	azlon	Update to Karmic, then to Lucid.
2010-04-23T13:19:00.000Z	azlon	theadmin	wait... i think i have Karmic... 9.10 right? its hard to keep track of the names after a while...
2010-04-23T13:20:00.000Z	theadmin	azlon	Uhm. output of "lsb_release -src" please
2010-04-23T13:20:00.000Z	azlon	theadmin	9.10 Karmic...
2010-04-23T13:21:00.000Z	theadmin	azlon	Then just run "sudo do-release-upgrade -d" and tada.
2010-04-23T13:23:00.000Z	theadmin	azlon	RC, not beta. But second one sounds like a better idea
2010-04-23T13:23:00.000Z	azlon	theadmin	got it. thanks.
2010-04-23T13:23:00.000Z	theadmin	azlon	Unless you use RAID or Compiz often, because due to certain bugs, with them system becomes hardly usable
2010-04-23T13:23:00.000Z	azlon	theadmin	actually the reason i am formatting is to recove a RAID-5 (fake-raid)
2010-04-23T13:25:00.000Z	azlon	theadmin	whats the deal with RAID in 10.04? something to stay away from for a while?
2010-04-23T13:25:00.000Z	theadmin	azlon	Read the rc page on Ubuntu.com, has a clean explanation. Can't remember off top of my head
2010-04-23T13:25:00.000Z	azlon	theadmin	the package i wanted to download was mdadm, thats actually what started this whole mess...
2010-04-23T13:25:00.000Z	azlon	theadmin	ok, thanks
2010-04-23T14:44:00.000Z	theadmin	azlon	Yes
2010-04-23T14:46:00.000Z	azlon	theadmin	i am currently running a live version of 10.04 and using apt-get -d install to download mdadm and samba, can i get these files from my system later by just plugging in this thumb drive?
2010-04-23T14:47:00.000Z	theadmin	azlon	uuuh... o_O dunno
2010-04-23T14:47:00.000Z	azlon	theadmin	ok
2010-04-30T12:47:00.000Z	azlon	theadmin	hey man, you have any experience with mdadm?
2010-04-30T12:47:00.000Z	theadmin	azlon	No, no idea who that dad is.
