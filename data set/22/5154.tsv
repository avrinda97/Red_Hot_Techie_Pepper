2007-07-08T13:19:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Jordan_U	it seems its the combination of video card and whatever he uses to hook to his tv driving it nuts, but it worked with edgy's driver
2007-07-08T13:19:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Jordan_U	so we're trying it
2007-07-08T13:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	macogw-is-a-girl	And apt-get build dep didn't get the correct dependencies because of the different version? ( sorry, I just want to get caught up )
2007-07-08T13:22:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Jordan_U	i forgot about that command
2007-07-08T13:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	macogw-is-a-girl	Yes

2007-07-08T13:35:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Jordan_U	i didnt think it'd auto modprobe the new one though
2007-07-08T13:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	macogw-is-a-girl	X loads modules when it starts AFIK
2007-07-08T13:36:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Jordan_U	oh ok.  thatll probably be useful at some point
2007-07-08T13:36:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Jordan_U	any idea on relativeownershi's error?
2007-07-08T13:40:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Jordan_U	think an xorg reconfigure would do anything?
2007-07-08T13:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	macogw-is-a-girl	I don't think so but it would be interesting to see if i810 would be an option
2007-07-08T13:56:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Jordan_U	wait wait how do you do that?
2007-07-08T13:56:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Jordan_U	whats sysrq?

2007-07-08T14:00:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Jordan_U	cant X forward to a non-X-having computer
2007-07-08T14:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	macogw-is-a-girl	Yes, there is no "hidden bit" in Unix file systems, so it  is more just a convention that most apps follow to hide .files
