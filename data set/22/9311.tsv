2005-01-15T06:28:00.000Z	jdodson		copy an audio cd?
2005-01-15T06:28:00.000Z	khadyoung	jdodson	aye
2005-01-15T06:29:00.000Z	jdodson		i would use k3b.
2005-01-15T06:29:00.000Z	khadyoung	jdodson	dammit... That's not the answer I wanted to hear
2005-01-15T06:29:00.000Z	khadyoung	jdodson	I guess I have to give in and get some KDE fungus growing in my system
2005-01-15T06:29:00.000Z	jdodson	khadyoung	i know, i just havent found something really good that is #1 gnome based, #2 in universe.
2005-01-15T06:30:00.000Z	jdodson	khadyoung	plus i could only get it working in root mode, UGH.
2005-01-15T06:30:00.000Z	khadyoung	jdodson	How has linux gone this long without simple CD recording?
2005-01-15T06:31:00.000Z	jdodson	khadyoung	gnu/linux has had simple cd recording forever via the commandline:)  and more advanced functionality via k3b.
2005-01-15T06:31:00.000Z	jdodson		perhaps you mean, how has gnome ......
2005-01-15T06:31:00.000Z	jdodson		donl: you dont need that many at all, i think i needed like 3.
2005-01-15T06:31:00.000Z	khadyoung	jdodson	Well how does one copy an audio CD from the command line, then? .. :)
2005-01-15T06:32:00.000Z	jdodson		http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/CD-Writing-HOWTO.html
2005-01-15T06:32:00.000Z	jdodson		it looks like it has all the info you need.
2005-01-15T06:33:00.000Z	jdodson		obsitianx: Yes.
2005-01-15T06:34:00.000Z	khadyoung	jdodson	It just seems weird to me that other people seem OK with an OS that doesn't copy CDs or burn audio CDs.
2005-01-15T06:34:00.000Z	jdodson	khadyoung	the os does copy cds.
2005-01-15T06:34:00.000Z	khadyoung	jdodson	Not from GUI, though does it?
2005-01-15T06:34:00.000Z	jdodson	khadyoung	it has for sometime, ubuntu natively just does not make it really easy to do "everything".  then again neither does xp.
2005-01-15T06:35:00.000Z	jdodson	khadyoung	when you mean OS, do you mean ubuntu?
2005-01-15T06:35:00.000Z	khadyoung	jdodson	Yes, I meant Ubuntu. Sorry for any confusion
2005-01-15T06:35:00.000Z	jdodson	khadyoung	well ok, native in ubuntu you can create data cds via nautlius.
