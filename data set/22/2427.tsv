2009-06-13T11:23:00.000Z	noric		hi! I'm about to install 9.04 desktop i386 on my quadcore. Is SMP equiavalent to multicore support? i.e., do I need to compile a kernel to take advantage of my quadcore, or will it work out of the box?
2009-06-13T11:23:00.000Z	mykola	noric	quad works out of the box, im running one :D
2009-06-13T11:24:00.000Z	noric	mykola	Boobah said the opposite of you
2009-06-13T11:24:00.000Z	mykola	noric	i dunno. I have an intel core 2 quad and it's running just fine
2009-06-13T11:25:00.000Z	noric	mykola	does top show two cores, or how do you monitor that?
2009-06-13T11:25:00.000Z	mykola	noric	gnome system monitor shows all 4 cores... for instance, 1 is a 8% 2 is at 2.8% 3 is a 2 % and 4 is at 7% for me right now
2009-06-13T11:26:00.000Z	noric	mykola	any idea why Boohbah says I need SMP?
2009-06-13T11:26:00.000Z	mykola	noric	you have to ask him about that
2009-06-13T11:26:00.000Z	mykola	noric	it might be that ubuntu auto installs smp, in which case he would be right
2009-06-13T11:28:00.000Z	mykola	noric	just as i suspected ^_^
2009-06-13T11:29:00.000Z	mykola	noric	I've done no such thing. and I think i believe usser
2009-06-13T11:29:00.000Z	noric	mykola	I believe you guys, but why do the official docs say it isn't supported ??
2009-06-13T11:30:00.000Z	mykola	noric	can't answer that one. you could always just try and see what happens ^_^
2009-06-13T11:30:00.000Z	noric	mykola	suppose so :P
2009-06-13T11:44:00.000Z	mykola	noric	what is the difference between what you did and changing /etc/apt/sources.list?
2009-06-13T11:44:00.000Z	noric	mykola	just that i was trying to deviate as little from his path as possible
2009-06-13T11:45:00.000Z	noric	mykola	and I don't know much about where apt sources its sources from
2009-06-13T11:45:00.000Z	mykola	noric	i see. so is there any difference between the two?
2009-06-13T11:45:00.000Z	mykola	noric	ah... k
2009-06-13T11:51:00.000Z	mykola	noric	did you verify the cd after burning? :)
2009-06-13T11:51:00.000Z	noric	mykola	I verified my bootable usb key after creating :p
2009-06-13T11:52:00.000Z	mykola	noric	oops... got your name wrong. meant to say Joushua_Mayer
