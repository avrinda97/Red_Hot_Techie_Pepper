2005-03-24T07:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	spiderworm	 no
2005-03-24T07:31:00.000Z	spiderworm	eyequeue	everything is considered stable?
2005-03-24T07:31:00.000Z	eyequeue	spiderworm	 ubuntu's stable is much more recent than debian's, and there is also a development branch called hoary
2005-03-24T07:31:00.000Z	eyequeue	spiderworm	 warty is stable btw
2005-03-24T07:31:00.000Z	spiderworm		where can i see the stable package list?
2005-03-24T07:32:00.000Z	eyequeue	spiderworm	 i'd recommend starting with warty/stable, since it may be new enough for your needs
2005-03-24T07:32:00.000Z	spiderworm		ok ty
2005-03-24T07:33:00.000Z	spiderworm		warty is stable, hoary is testing?
2005-03-24T07:34:00.000Z	eyequeue	spiderworm	 there is not direct correleation to debian's testing or unstable, but hoary is the development branch, to become stable next month
2005-03-24T07:35:00.000Z	spiderworm		damn.  looks like fedora's pretty installer and booting screen had me deceived
2005-03-24T07:40:00.000Z	spiderworm		ok looks like i'll be switching to ubuntu.  the guys in #fedora that "help" others are even pricks.  pardon my french but fsck fedora and fsck them.
2005-03-24T07:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	spiderworm	 two points
2005-03-24T07:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	spiderworm	 i think ubuntu is a great distro
2005-03-24T07:42:00.000Z	spiderworm	eyequeue	yes?
2005-03-24T07:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	spiderworm	 i think #ubuntu also provides great support
2005-03-24T07:42:00.000Z	spiderworm		there must be a but coming?
2005-03-24T07:43:00.000Z	eyequeue	spiderworm	 it's nice that both happen together, but a distro can be technically competent without having great people running it, heh
2005-03-24T07:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	spiderworm	 yes i'm thinking of a non-linux *nix :)
2005-03-24T07:44:00.000Z	spiderworm	eyequeue	what do you mean?
2005-03-24T07:44:00.000Z	spiderworm	eyequeue	bsd?
2005-03-24T07:45:00.000Z	spiderworm	eyequeue	openbsd or freebsd?
2005-03-24T07:45:00.000Z	eyequeue	spiderworm	 yes, one of the bsd's, but i don't want to publically badmouth any and start flame wars
