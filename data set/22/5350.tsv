2007-05-23T12:26:00.000Z	orbisvicis		hmm i need a release date
2007-05-23T12:26:00.000Z	Flannel	orbisvicis	You should ask the enlightenment people.  I'm not even sure they have one
2007-06-13T05:31:00.000Z	Flannel	orbisvicis	You're doing this from apache?  is www-data part of the cd group?
2007-06-13T05:31:00.000Z	orbisvicis	Flannel	i just installed apache to learn it, but I havent configured it in any way .. how do I add www-data ?
2007-06-13T05:31:00.000Z	Flannel	orbisvicis	Well, are you trying to get apache to read CDs or something?  Or are they unrelated?
2007-06-13T05:31:00.000Z	orbisvicis	Flannel	no I just installed about 180 packages then I get this error so Im having trouble narrowing it down ... I am not trying to get apache to do anything
2007-06-13T05:38:00.000Z	orbisvicis	Flannel	is there any way I can figure out/narrow-down the error ?
2007-06-29T11:54:00.000Z	Flannel	orbisvicis	it uses UDP, so no.  You'll need to tunnel X through ssh.
2007-06-29T12:08:00.000Z	orbisvicis	Flannel	so if i want vncserver with seperate sessions, then 'system-prefs-remote desktop' wont work, && i need vnc4server ?
2007-06-29T12:10:00.000Z	Flannel	orbisvicis	I have no idea how VNC works.
2007-06-29T12:10:00.000Z	orbisvicis	Flannel	sorry 'bout that then
2007-06-30T09:30:00.000Z	Flannel	orbisvicis	oh, sorry.
2008-03-23T00:02:00.000Z	Flannel	orbisvicis	Why do you want to do that?
2008-03-23T00:03:00.000Z	orbisvicis	Flannel	for audio (high rez timers, tickless, and jackd)
2008-03-23T00:04:00.000Z	Flannel	orbisvicis	Ah, the correct reasons.  linux-image-rt is in universe
2008-03-23T00:05:00.000Z	orbisvicis	Flannel	i have that, and rebooted, and i look in / and find vmlinuz and vmlinuz.old, but uname -a returns 2.6.22-14-generic
2008-03-23T00:05:00.000Z	orbisvicis	Flannel	is there an extra step ?
2008-03-23T00:05:00.000Z	Flannel	orbisvicis	You'll need to select the RT image from GRUB
2008-03-23T00:06:00.000Z	orbisvicis	Flannel	ah. Thanks
2008-03-30T08:39:00.000Z	Flannel	orbisvicis	build-essential
2008-04-01T10:00:00.000Z	orbisvicis	Flannel	oh
