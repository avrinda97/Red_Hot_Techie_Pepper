2008-03-24T07:19:00.000Z	daved		kjp: does "stop" work and "restart" not work?

2008-03-24T07:41:00.000Z	daved	kjp2	looks like at some point ubuntu started symlinking /bin/sh to /bin/dash instead of /bin/bash
2008-03-24T07:41:00.000Z	daved		so bash-only crap doesnt work
2008-03-24T07:41:00.000Z	daved		took me forever to figure out what that == wouldnt work
