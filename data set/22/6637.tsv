2006-08-31T16:40:00.000Z	Arafangion		Wierd issue: Gnome's panel randomly rearranges itself from time to time.
2006-08-31T16:40:00.000Z	Arafangion		And I can't move things back!
2006-08-31T05:21:00.000Z	Arafangion		Sorry, *teleyinex*: Impossible.

2006-08-31T05:23:00.000Z	Arafangion	arag0rn	Actually, I just realised that my solution converts it to html, not docs.
2006-08-31T05:23:00.000Z	Arafangion	arag0rn	Not pdf's, I mean.
2006-08-31T05:24:00.000Z	Arafangion	arag0rn	Just a moment, I have to distill it out of my piece-of-crap-300-page-overdesigned-software-engineering-java-project-that-only-works-on-windows.
2006-08-31T05:24:00.000Z	Arafangion	arag0rn	Lost 4/20 marks just because a half page was the wrong damn font size! (2 sizes too small)
2006-08-31T05:27:00.000Z	snessubuntu	Arafangion	I typed wrong name, cabextact in terminal worked, I got alreaddy installed latest version

2006-08-31T05:29:00.000Z	Arafangion	arag0rn	Get: www.fussycoder.id.au/OOoConversionMacros.txt
2006-08-31T05:31:00.000Z	Arafangion	arag0rn	Sorry, try again.
2006-08-31T05:35:00.000Z	Arafangion	arag0rn	Do you know how to install macros into OpenOffice?
2006-08-31T05:35:00.000Z	Arafangion	arag0rn	If not, privmsg me.
2006-08-31T05:35:00.000Z	snessubuntu	Arafangion	it might be needed to say, when starting the IE install, first thing it says is: "IEs4Linux 2.0 is developed to be used with recent Wine versions (0.9.x). It seems that you are using an old version (). It's recommended that you update your wine to the latest version (Go to: winehq.com)." (I have wine 0.9.9 installed)
2006-08-31T05:37:00.000Z	Arafangion	arag0rn	Ahh, excellent. :)
2006-08-31T05:38:00.000Z	Arafangion	arag0rn	I seriously _hated_ this project :(
2006-08-31T05:43:00.000Z	Arafangion	arag0rn	du -h /media/cdrom: Total: 42 MB
2006-08-31T05:44:00.000Z	Arafangion	arag0rn	That was mostly the documentation!
2006-08-31T05:49:00.000Z	Arafangion	arag0rn	Still, 300 damn pages?
2006-08-31T05:49:00.000Z	Arafangion	arag0rn	For a freaking website generator! (Makes a table of contents)
2006-08-31T06:37:00.000Z	snessubuntu	Arafangion	if you're still there, got a clearer error message now: http://paste-bin.com/225
