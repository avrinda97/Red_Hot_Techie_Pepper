2006-06-10T14:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	gentoo_helper	get network manager
2006-06-10T14:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	gentoo_helper	If you're using dapper install network-manager-gnome
2006-06-10T14:48:00.000Z	gentoo_helper	Amaranth	Look. Isn't there a way I can do this on the command line? I usually use gentoo and I'm not that fond of the GUI. :(
2006-06-10T14:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	gentoo_helper	Why would you expect iwconfig to remember your password?
2006-06-10T14:49:00.000Z	gentoo_helper	Amaranth	Besides, I used network-manager-gnome and it worked just fine, it just won't reconfigure wlan0 on boot.
2006-06-10T14:50:00.000Z	gentoo_helper	Amaranth	Because I though the job of the /etc/network/interfaces file was to pass that information to iwconfig.
2006-06-10T14:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	gentoo_helper	it is, afaik
2006-06-10T14:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	gentoo_helper	but iwconfig doesn't write to /etc/network/interfaces
2006-06-10T14:51:00.000Z	gentoo_helper	Amaranth	Well...then shouldn't it pass my wep key to iwconfig?
2006-06-10T14:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	gentoo_helper	it should
2006-06-10T14:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	gentoo_helper	you might have found a bug
2006-06-10T14:52:00.000Z	gentoo_helper	Amaranth	A bug already? Damn. This is my first day... :(
2006-06-10T14:52:00.000Z	gentoo_helper	Amaranth	Well. I don't plan on submitting a bug report until I'm *really* sure something is amiss.
2006-06-10T14:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	gentoo_helper	you're putting things like wireless-essid Home in /etc/network/interfaces?
2006-06-10T14:54:00.000Z	gentoo_helper	Amaranth	Well yes.
2006-06-10T14:54:00.000Z	gentoo_helper	Amaranth	That's where the tool found under System --> Administration --> Networking put them. I am just checking those lines.
2006-06-10T14:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	gentoo_helper	I'd just use network-manager and a startup script that make sure wlan0 comes up right
2006-06-10T14:55:00.000Z	gentoo_helper	Amaranth	That's the other thing: How on earth do I get a script to run at startup? I've never needed to do that before.
2006-06-10T14:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	gentoo_helper	system startup or X login?
2006-06-10T14:56:00.000Z	gentoo_helper	Amaranth	Well. I just need it to run after /etc/init.d/networking does.
2006-06-10T14:56:00.000Z	gentoo_helper	Amaranth	I was going to write a simple script to do what I usually do (the whole iwconfig wlan0 essid ... thing)
2006-06-10T14:57:00.000Z	Amaranth	gentoo_helper	what nickrud said
