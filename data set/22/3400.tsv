2009-11-01T13:44:00.000Z	DasEi	harisund	sure ?
2009-11-01T13:33:00.000Z	DasEi	harisund	karmic ?
2009-11-01T13:33:00.000Z	harisund	DasEi	Doesn't matter which one .. any Linux. Dr_Willis xset dpms force off switches it off, but I have not started X
2009-11-01T13:35:00.000Z	DasEi	harisund	well, hal can do it, device-kit I think, too and next are power-saving related thincs (acpi) , so need more clearance
2009-11-01T13:35:00.000Z	harisund	DasEi	hmmm interesting
2009-11-01T13:36:00.000Z	harisund	DasEi	So what is used in 9.10? HAL or device-kit or ..?
2009-11-01T13:36:00.000Z	DasEi	harisund	device-kit, hal still available, acpi-event I think way to go (is it a laptop ?)
2009-11-01T13:37:00.000Z	harisund	DasEi	yes, old laptop :(
2009-11-01T13:37:00.000Z	DasEi	harisund	have you checked bios for powersaving config ?
2009-11-01T13:39:00.000Z	harisund	DasEi	nothing particular in the bios about power config
2009-11-01T13:40:00.000Z	DasEi	harisund	so can configure it under system > preferences > energy,  switch of monitor,  if acpi is supported
2009-11-01T13:41:00.000Z	harisund	DasEi	I don't have X running man. There is no System->preferences->Energy. I already know how to turn it off if I have X running, I am running just the command line ><
2009-11-01T13:44:00.000Z	DasEi	harisund	so why not use the dpms, if that works on that screen
2009-11-01T13:44:00.000Z	harisund	DasEi	because dpms can only be used if X is running and I am not running X
2009-11-01T13:46:00.000Z	DasEi	harisund	try edit xorg.conf
2009-11-01T13:47:00.000Z	harisund	DasEi	I don't have X running !!!! There's no xorg.conf at all !!!
2009-11-01T13:48:00.000Z	DasEi	harisund	http://paste.ubuntu.com/306508/   (/etc/X11/xorg.conf)  , no xserver at all ?
2009-11-01T13:48:00.000Z	harisund	DasEi	I don't have a xserver, nope.
2009-11-01T13:54:00.000Z	DasEi	harisund	have you got a file :  /etc/default/acpi-support
2009-11-01T13:55:00.000Z	harisund	DasEi	yeah I do
2009-11-01T13:57:00.000Z	DasEi	harisund	in there and the files around could be a solutin (sleep.sh) , you will have to enable a sleep mode for your display only, but I ge tired to dig for detials
2009-11-01T13:57:00.000Z	harisund	DasEi	that's cool man thanks don't worry about it
