2012-02-08T05:35:00.000Z	Canadian1296		I know I should ask to ask questions, but aI have a security question for Ubuntu 11.10. Should I ask it here or is there a deticated security channel?
2012-02-08T05:35:00.000Z	Canadian1296		**shouldn't
2012-02-08T05:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Canadian1296	oneiric is supported here, ask away
2012-02-08T05:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Canadian1296	the default install is pretty well setup. Just stick to using sudo when needed and you'll be ok
2012-02-08T05:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Canadian1296	you could use ufw to configure a firewall etc
2012-02-08T05:43:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ActionParsnip	Okay I'll do both, any other tips? I'm looking for over the top paranoid security here :P
2012-02-08T05:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Canadian1296	could use tor proxy if your tinfoil hat collection is vast
2012-02-08T05:44:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ActionParsnip	is there any way to force all outgoing connections through tor, or would I have to manually configure every application?
2012-02-08T05:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Canadian1296	there are guides online but you can make it the system wide setting
2012-02-08T05:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Canadian1296	why so paranoid?
2012-02-08T05:46:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ActionParsnip	Cause I can be :P I'm setting this up in virtualbox, which isnt ideal, but I just want to learn as much about security like this as I can. Better to be too paranoid than not paranoid enough :)
2012-02-08T05:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Canadian1296	sudo apt-get install lxde lightdm   works here :)
2012-02-08T05:53:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ActionParsnip	Okay, thanks :)
2012-02-08T06:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Canadian1296	true, you can make a backup of your disk image and restore if things go screwy
2012-02-08T06:29:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ActionParsnip	Exactly. Anyway I want to try that. Any ideas on how?
2012-02-08T06:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Canadian1296	no idea. I steer clear of encrypted drive nonesense, too many headaches
2012-02-08T06:30:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ActionParsnip	Okay, thanks anyways
2012-02-24T05:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Canadian1296	why not both :)
2012-02-24T05:16:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ActionParsnip	Okay I will
2012-03-05T04:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Canadian1296	you will need to delete the tables you made first, you can then uninstall the packages like any other app
2012-03-05T04:01:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ActionParsnip	Thanks
2012-05-29T07:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Canadian1296	you'll need a check to make sure that the file name doesn't already exist or the dest file will be overwritten
