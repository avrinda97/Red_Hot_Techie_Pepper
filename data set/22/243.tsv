2012-08-06T12:01:00.000Z	Kingsy		guys, anyone got some good info on drivers? more specifically the radeon open driver that ships with ubuntu ?
2012-08-06T12:02:00.000Z	Kingsy		no way.. that cant be true
2012-08-06T12:03:00.000Z	L3top	Kingsy	Do you have an ubuntu support question?
2012-08-06T12:04:00.000Z	Kingsy	L3top	well kinda, do you use that driver? if so have you noticed that its got really bad performance? I even get jumpy screensavers
2012-08-06T12:05:00.000Z	L3top	Kingsy	the open driver is rarely as capable of handling newer high end cards than the proprietary.
2012-08-06T12:06:00.000Z	Kingsy	L3top	do you know much about the AMD proprietary driver? it seems really flakey to me, or is that only because I used the catalyst control center ?
2012-08-06T12:06:00.000Z	Kingsy	L3top	it was so flakey I binned it
2012-08-06T12:08:00.000Z	L3top	Kingsy	the repository version of the radeon driver may not fully support your card. You can try downloading and installing from ATI.
2012-08-06T12:08:00.000Z	L3top	Kingsy	Stop asking if anybody uses a driver that covers literally hundreds of chipsets.
2012-08-06T12:09:00.000Z	Kingsy	L3top	I was asking more generically to get a feel if its giving good performance + stability
2012-08-06T12:09:00.000Z	Kingsy	L3top	download it from "ATI" ? is this a resource?
2012-08-06T12:10:00.000Z	L3top	Kingsy	lspci -nn | grep VGA
2012-08-06T12:10:00.000Z	Kingsy	L3top	I am not on the pc right now.. so nm
2012-08-06T12:11:00.000Z	L3top	Kingsy	AMD/ATI is the card manufactuerer.
2012-08-06T12:11:00.000Z	Kingsy	L3top	ah ok.. so just download the driver from the official site
2012-08-06T12:13:00.000Z	Kingsy	L3top	well my card the HD 6850 is pretty old.. but I know what you mean.. I guessed the proprietary driver would be better.. I will give it another go when I get in from work
2012-08-06T12:15:00.000Z	L3top	Kingsy	you cannot simply uninstall fglrx and run radeon btw. You must purge things... reinstall mesa... reconfigure xserver... That is probably at issue currently.
2012-08-06T12:15:00.000Z	L3top	Kingsy	I would love to help you do all that... but you arent here for support it seems.
2012-08-06T12:16:00.000Z	Kingsy	L3top	yeah just here to discuss this really.. I will be on the terminal later tonight if your around?
2012-08-06T12:22:00.000Z	L3top	Kingsy	http://askubuntu.com/questions/68306/how-do-i-restore-default-video-drivers
2012-08-06T12:26:00.000Z	Kingsy	L3top	wow yeah I didnt do that :P
2012-09-16T19:00:00.000Z	L3top	Kingsy	xorg.conf is depreciated, but you can generate one by closing any x windows (if you are using unity sudo service lightdm stop), and typing Xorg -configure  it will dump an xorg.conf.new in your home directory
