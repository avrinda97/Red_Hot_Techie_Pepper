2009-11-22T00:51:00.000Z	nonick1		Who can help me? When I press Ctrl+c in terminal (to stop some programms) nothing happends. It just prints letter "c" but not "^C" Earlier it works correctly. (Sorry. I know English very very bad)
2009-11-22T00:52:00.000Z	trism	nonick1	depends on the program, sometimes you need to ctrl+d
2009-11-22T00:52:00.000Z	nonick1	trism	for example find
2009-11-22T00:53:00.000Z	nonick1	trism	Ctrl+d not works too
2009-11-22T00:54:00.000Z	trism	nonick1	not sure what the problem is, ctrl+c should work fine with find
2009-11-22T00:59:00.000Z	nonick1	trism	can shotructs in compiz be a problem?
2009-11-22T01:00:00.000Z	trism	nonick1	did you recently configure new ones before ctrl+c stopped working in the terminal?
2009-11-22T01:01:00.000Z	nonick1	trism	maybe
2009-11-22T01:03:00.000Z	trism	nonick1	this is in gnome-terminal right?
2009-11-22T01:03:00.000Z	nonick1	trism	yes
2009-11-22T01:04:00.000Z	trism	nonick1	try resetting your keyboard to defaults in System/Preferences/Keyboard on the Layouts tab
2009-11-22T01:06:00.000Z	nonick1	trism	nothing changes
2009-11-22T01:12:00.000Z	trism	nonick1	in the keyboard layout options of System/Preferences/Keyboard on the layout tab, is the ctrl key position set to default?
2009-11-22T01:14:00.000Z	nonick1	trism	yes :(
2009-11-22T01:17:00.000Z	nonick1	trism	switching off comiz is not a solution too
2009-11-22T01:27:00.000Z	trism	nonick1	does ctrl+ anything work? can you copy and paste with ctrl+shift+c ctrl+shift+v?
2009-11-22T01:28:00.000Z	nonick1	trism	1) no, I can't copy from terminal using ctrl+c 2) that's interesting: when I push ctrl+c it prints russian letters
2009-11-22T01:31:00.000Z	trism	nonick1	interesting, I saw that in a bug report http://forum.soft32.com/linux/Bug-513261-gnome-terminal-Ctrl-modifier-work-ftopict475450.html but a later message said he reset his keyboard to defaults in the gnome keyboard properties and it was fixed, which is why I suggested that earlier, but didn't seem to help
2009-11-22T01:34:00.000Z	nonick1	trism	I will restart my computer
2009-11-22T01:37:00.000Z	nonick1	trism	AAAAAAAAAA!!! It works!!! Thank you very much!
2009-11-22T01:38:00.000Z	trism	nonick1	excellent!
2009-11-22T01:40:00.000Z	nonick1	trism	good night (there is GMT+2)
