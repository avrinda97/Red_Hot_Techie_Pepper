2006-06-06T14:22:00.000Z	rody-DruAl		cant get this thing to work :'(
2006-06-06T14:23:00.000Z	rody-DruAl		Why can't i get into a console screen? Can't i just boot into console somehow?
2006-06-06T14:24:00.000Z	skippy81	rody-DruAl	 if you want to kill xwindows off use /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2006-06-06T14:24:00.000Z	skippy81	rody-DruAl	 you can remove that script from the runlevels if you want to boot into a command line
2006-06-06T14:24:00.000Z	rody-DruAl	skippy81	where should i put that? I can't get to anything
2006-06-06T14:25:00.000Z	skippy81	rody-DruAl	 are you just in gnome now?
2006-06-06T14:25:00.000Z	skippy81	rody-DruAl	 ah i see
2006-06-06T14:25:00.000Z	skippy81	rody-DruAl	 will control-alt-backspace work? or control-alt-F2?
2006-06-06T14:26:00.000Z	rody-DruAl	skippy81	yes i get a black screen
2006-06-06T14:26:00.000Z	skippy81	rody-DruAl	hmm doesnt sound good :(
2006-06-06T14:27:00.000Z	skippy81	rody-DruAl	 sorry im out of ideas, beyond using the alternative installation CD
2006-06-06T14:27:00.000Z	skippy81	rody-DruAl	 i assume you are trying to boot off live cd at the moment
2006-06-06T14:29:00.000Z	rody-DruAl	skippy81	yes that's right, a live cd yeah
2006-06-06T14:29:00.000Z	skippy81	rody-DruAl	 i suggest you download the alternative cd
2006-06-06T14:30:00.000Z	skippy81	rody-DruAl	 alternative CD doesnt rely on starting gnome to install
2006-06-06T14:31:00.000Z	skippy81	rody-DruAl	 and one you have it installed on disk, you have options for adjusting the gnome/xorg configuration to get everything working
2006-06-06T14:32:00.000Z	rody-DruAl	skippy81	ahh ok, i just wanted to 'not' install but run it from cd :S .. but that's just not an option i see.. Any ideas on a different Linux distribution maybe which can run from a cd?
2006-06-06T14:33:00.000Z	skippy81	rody-DruAl	 mephis has a decent live CD
2006-06-06T14:33:00.000Z	skippy81	rody-DruAl	 although mephis itself i dont like
2006-06-06T14:34:00.000Z	rody-DruAl	skippy81	do you think that could work?
2006-06-06T14:34:00.000Z	rody-DruAl	skippy81	or is it just the same problem ?
2006-06-06T14:34:00.000Z	skippy81	rody-DruAl	 i dont see why it wouldnt work, your problem obviously isnt that bad, isnce the kernel boots ok
