2010-08-03T16:14:00.000Z	SteelWing		I have a problem with glib the explanation is here: http://pastebin.com/d0EC2hgC
2010-08-03T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	SteelWing	where did you install it to?
2010-08-03T16:16:00.000Z	SteelWing	jrib	the default location
2010-08-03T16:16:00.000Z	SteelWing	jrib	rather where make install pointed it to.
2010-08-03T16:16:00.000Z	jrib	SteelWing	I do not know this information.
2010-08-03T16:16:00.000Z	SteelWing	jrib	let me go look through it.
2010-08-03T16:19:00.000Z	SteelWing	jrib	hmm... I just noticed a big problem
2010-08-03T16:19:00.000Z	jrib	SteelWing	hmm?
2010-08-03T16:22:00.000Z	SteelWing	jrib	No dice.
2010-08-03T16:23:00.000Z	jrib	SteelWing	you still haven't answered my question
2010-08-03T16:24:00.000Z	SteelWing	jrib	I don't know where it installs to. According to the install instructions one of the files is in exec_prefix/lib/glib/include. But to behonest the instructions were merely ./configure, make, rm -rf 2 files, make install.. I'm sorry but I have no idea where this went to.
2010-08-03T16:26:00.000Z	jrib	SteelWing	either read the documentation or read "./configure --help"
2010-08-03T16:26:00.000Z	SteelWing	jrib	Just grew a brain and read through the steps terminal took. Looks like it went to /usr/local/lib
2010-08-03T16:26:00.000Z	jrib	SteelWing	ok.  Check if it is there
2010-08-03T16:28:00.000Z	SteelWing	jrib	Actually... it doesn't look like it.
2010-08-03T16:28:00.000Z	jrib	SteelWing	have you rebooted since uninstalling?
2010-08-03T16:29:00.000Z	SteelWing	jrib	My appologies once more. I've fallen under the linux stereotype that once you go linux rebooting is a thing of the past. I'll uninstall and reboot
2010-08-03T16:29:00.000Z	jrib	SteelWing	possible, but not worth it in this case
2010-08-03T16:31:00.000Z	SteelWing	jrib	hmm.. after uninstalling some files were removed from /usr/local/lib... I guess its possible it half installed..? Regardless I'm going to reboot now.
2010-08-03T16:46:00.000Z	SteelWing	jrib	Once again simple reboot conquers all. It is fixed. Thanks again.
2010-08-03T16:46:00.000Z	jrib	SteelWing	no problem
2010-08-03T16:46:00.000Z	jrib	SteelWing	the old glib was still in memory
