2009-09-24T11:56:00.000Z	Curly_Q		SWAP partition equals or not doubles the your RAM.
2009-09-24T11:57:00.000Z	umar	Curly_Q	which one of hte 4 is the SWAP partition?
2009-09-24T11:57:00.000Z	Curly_Q		The SWAP partition in Linux is the same as the " CONTIGUOUS" file in Windows. It works the same.
2009-09-24T11:58:00.000Z	Curly_Q		It should say /swap
2009-09-24T11:59:00.000Z	umar	Curly_Q	i dont have any partition with name /swap, the four that my System Monitor is showing are:  1) /, 2) /boot, 3) /home, and 4) /home/umar/.gvfs
2009-09-24T12:00:00.000Z	Curly_Q		The only difference is in Windows the SWAP or Contiguous file is not really a partition. However, you can use a separate hard drive with Windows to SWAP files as a contiguous file. it is involved, but you should get the idea.
2009-09-24T12:01:00.000Z	umar	Curly_Q	with sizes being: 1)37GB, 2)91MB,3)18.5Gb, and 4)37GB respectively
2009-09-24T12:01:00.000Z	Curly_Q		The point is that you need to install Ubuntu or any Linux Kernel with a /swap file.
2009-09-24T12:03:00.000Z	Curly_Q	CastilleV	learn POSIX COMPLIANT C and you will do good if you want to be a good programmer.
2009-09-24T12:04:00.000Z	Curly_Q		POSIX compliancy is a portable C language which works well with UNIX, LINUX, and Windows etc.
2009-09-24T12:06:00.000Z	umar	Curly_Q	just googled and found that gparted is a tool for resizing partitions. i need to install it using apt-get, and hopefully it is all straightforward from then on?
2009-09-24T12:07:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Lolek there is a PORT BLOCK somewhere there. Or a permissions problem. Or a network IP block on those particular PORTS.
2009-09-24T12:08:00.000Z	Curly_Q		What was the problem?
2009-09-24T12:09:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Great.
2009-09-24T12:11:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Lolek, as a Network Administrator, I see these problems all of the time. And the main problem and most sought after questions has to do with permissions problems. If you have a shell account, you don't have permissions unless the Network Administrator allows or permits your interactions.
2009-09-24T12:13:00.000Z	Curly_Q		With any LINUX or UBUNTU issue ROOT is everything. With permissions, you can control the world of Linux.
2009-09-24T12:15:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Nice point and well taken KingTiger01  <---------------------------<
2009-09-24T12:15:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Try a Wikipedia or a Google on that.
2009-09-24T12:16:00.000Z	umar	Curly_Q	found a solution, moving stuff out from there into /www/newfolder. actually the cirtual pc images were taking quite a lot of space
2009-09-24T12:17:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Umar that tells me a lot and as I said earlier, a small Hard Drive is useless.
2009-09-24T12:18:00.000Z	umar	Curly_Q	i mean i had two 5 GB images of a virtual pcs in my home folder, i just moved them out to create space. but for a better fix, shoudi use gparted?
