2005-03-19T16:48:00.000Z	windows-farhan		question.
2005-03-19T16:48:00.000Z	windows-farhan		whats up with the ubuntu package list?
2005-03-19T16:48:00.000Z	windows-farhan		i see a screenreader in the haurry package list
2005-03-19T16:48:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	First:  Don't say "question"; thats _why_ people are here. Second:  Be specific.
2005-03-19T16:49:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	 Install it, and boot into it.
2005-03-19T16:50:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	 What?
2005-03-19T16:50:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	 When else would you boot into something?
2005-03-19T16:50:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	 Why not just download kernel-image-2.4.27-speakup and boot that?
2005-03-19T16:50:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	 First off, it's
2005-03-19T16:51:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	 "kernel";  please don't deliberately mispell things;  it's confusing, and annoying as hell
2005-03-19T16:53:00.000Z	windows-farhan	geppy	is the speakup 2.4 included on the wordy or haury cds? so i can boot in to it in the install?
2005-03-19T16:54:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	 No.
2005-03-19T16:54:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	Yes, that's what I said.
2005-03-19T16:55:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	 Why not just install Hoary, and then install the speakup package?
2005-03-19T16:55:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	 'tisn't exactly difficult
2005-03-19T16:56:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	 Understood;   I hadn't thought of not being able to install.
2005-03-19T16:56:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	 it's possible to build your own CD, but it's kind of a pain in the ass
2005-03-19T16:56:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	As far as I know, speakup is for 2.4;  Ubuntu uses 2.6
2005-03-19T16:57:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	Right, but it's for 2.4
2005-03-19T16:57:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	 I'm confused.
2005-03-19T16:57:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	Perhaps you could have someone help you to install it?
2005-03-19T16:57:00.000Z	geppy	windows-farhan	 After finishing the install, it'd be simple enough to install speakup
