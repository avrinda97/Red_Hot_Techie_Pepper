2009-10-18T03:50:00.000Z	cody_	netbrain	I know that envy is iffy at best
2009-10-18T03:51:00.000Z	netbrain	cody_	then dont use envy..
2009-10-18T03:51:00.000Z	netbrain	cody_	its pretty easy to install the propriatery driver without
2009-10-18T03:51:00.000Z	cody_	netbrain	I need the nvidia proprietory driver, not the opensource nv drier
2009-10-18T03:51:00.000Z	cody_		driver*
2009-10-18T03:52:00.000Z	cody_	netbrain	I have tried: the driver from nvidia and sh nvidiadrivername.run and it damaged all video of ubuntu, forcing me to restore. I am now trying the driver in apt
2009-10-18T03:52:00.000Z	netbrain	cody_	apt-get install nvidia-glx-xxx nvidia-settings should do the trick
2009-10-18T03:53:00.000Z	netbrain	cody_	use package manager, dont go to nvidia.com to download drivers
2009-10-18T03:53:00.000Z	cody_	netbrain	That is what i just did, the package manager, installed nvidia-71-glx (the one for my card) and now it tells me to run nvidia-xconfig which doesnt exist?
2009-10-18T03:54:00.000Z	netbrain	cody_	and what did apt-file say?
2009-10-18T03:54:00.000Z	cody_	netbrain	apt-file is running as of now
2009-10-18T03:54:00.000Z	cody_		apt-file is updating i mean
2009-10-18T03:54:00.000Z	netbrain	cody_	what version of ubuntu are you running?
2009-10-18T03:54:00.000Z	cody_	netbrain	9.04
2009-10-18T03:59:00.000Z	cody_	netbrain	apt-file takes forever to update :p gonna go grab somethin to eat while it is, i will inform you when it is done
2009-10-18T03:59:00.000Z	netbrain	cody_	k.

2009-10-18T04:20:00.000Z	netbrain	cody_	did it work?
2009-10-18T04:40:00.000Z	cody_	netbrain	Sorry, i was not at my computer. None of those even support my card
