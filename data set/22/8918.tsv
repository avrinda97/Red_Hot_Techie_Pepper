2005-04-22T12:12:00.000Z	pseudo		is there a way to link the output?
2005-04-22T12:12:00.000Z	SeamusLP		pseudo what do you mean by link the output?
2005-04-22T12:13:00.000Z	pseudo		like get both soun systems to share the common dsp?
2005-04-22T12:14:00.000Z	SeamusLP	pseudo	I wish I knew of a way.  My solution was to ditch esd completely.  I configured totem to use alsa.  As far as getting your gnome sounds to go through alsa, I'm not so sure you can do that without some really dirty hacks.
2005-04-22T12:15:00.000Z	pseudo	SeamusLP	thanks
