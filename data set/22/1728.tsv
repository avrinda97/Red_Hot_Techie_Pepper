2010-07-08T17:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	razz1	 ssh has a -v and -vv and -vvv option that give more verbose error messages
2010-08-08T03:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	razz1	 you could set up gdm to autolog in to the user you want and set Gnme to  share teh desktop by default also.
2010-08-08T03:55:00.000Z	razz1	Dr_Willis	your idea sounds interesting,  I am using gnome, how can gnome share the desktop by default won't it need a vnc server?  I am fairly new to this
2010-08-08T03:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	razz1	 gnome has a vncserver built in. look in the users settings menu
2010-08-08T03:59:00.000Z	razz1	Dr_Willis	at present  I use the default vino server, not happy with it, that's why looking for other options.
2010-08-08T04:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	razz1	 shareing the virrent visible desktop is going to be more sluggish then haveing a 'seperate hidden desktop'   , FreeNX will give even better perforamce. but its harder to setup
2010-08-08T04:03:00.000Z	razz1	Dr_Willis	tried to setup freenx, but the setupnx file was missing when I installed freenx, to fix this I would have had to get that file from ubuntu forums, someone posted it there,  I don't want to that. Not sure whether it's wise to use executable files from forums!! I already have a secure ssh to the remote machine using keys.
2010-08-08T04:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	razz1	 ther is also an amterantive to freenx, but i forget its name. saw it on the (confuseing) nx ubuntu wiki page.
2010-08-08T04:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	razz1	 if its a linux to linux box. uyou could just ssh -X in and run whatever app you wanted. No need to have a full desktop going
2010-08-08T04:07:00.000Z	razz1	Dr_Willis	neatnx, or the nomachine proprietary one, yep I use x-forwarding via ssh most of the time, but the users on the remote system are not computer savvy .  I will need access to their desktop to show them stuff
2010-08-08T04:09:00.000Z	razz1	Dr_Willis	i asked around which implementation would be most responsive, most of them suggested  I try different options and pick one myself. Thats what I am doin
2010-08-08T04:11:00.000Z	razz1	Dr_Willis	when I ssh the remote system, and enter something like "evince xyz.pdf" at the remote machine's command prompt, xyz.pdf doesn't open on the remote machine's desktop. any guess why?
2010-08-08T04:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	razz1	 you diddnet 'ssh -X remotebox'
2010-08-08T04:16:00.000Z	razz1	Dr_Willis	but -X is for forwarding X, what I am trying to do is just open a pdf (it's already present in the remote's home folder,) on the remote machine
2010-08-08T04:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	razz1	 and you want it to appear on teh remote box? or locally?
2010-08-08T04:17:00.000Z	razz1	Dr_Willis	on the remote box
2010-08-08T04:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	razz1	 you need to set your DISPLAY and 'xhost' settings properly
2010-08-20T17:34:00.000Z	razz1	Dr_Willis	it has an alarm plugin, I think it created a task scheduler entry. I really miss it.
2010-08-20T17:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	razz1	 still. Ive never seen a way to schedule a 'wakup from suspend'  feature in any os..  Seen NIC's have a wakeup feature..
2010-08-20T17:39:00.000Z	razz1	Dr_Willis	even media centre had that functionality, my system used to wakeup from suspend, record and go to sleep again. I am pretty sure mythtv has that function, though I haven't used it. I will try the forums
2010-08-20T17:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	razz1	 my last experience with 'suspend' was lots of programs crashing. :)
2010-08-20T17:42:00.000Z	razz1	Dr_Willis	try the FEBE addon that way it's easy to transfer all your addons. By the way suspend works fine on my system but hibernation has issues. I guess its because I created swap after installing the system. its in my home folder. Need to fix it
