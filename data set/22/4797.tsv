2007-10-27T07:18:00.000Z	tiago		Hi all, any one care to help me install VMware player/server on Ubuntu 7.10 64bit? I've been trying for days
2007-10-27T07:19:00.000Z	LiMaO	tiago	why don't you try running virtualbox instead?
2007-10-27T07:20:00.000Z	tiago	LiMaO	I have images created in VMware on Windows i would like to run in Linux also
2007-10-27T07:21:00.000Z	LiMaO	tiago	vmware to virtualbox converter --> http://www.vivaolinux.com.br/scripts/verScript.php?codigo=3016  --  tell me if you can't read the page
2007-10-27T07:22:00.000Z	LiMaO	tiago	that way you may convert your images and use them on virtualbox
2007-10-27T07:22:00.000Z	tiago	LiMaO	would i have to convert it again when i want to open it in vmware on windows?
2007-10-27T07:23:00.000Z	LiMaO	tiago	you may keep both images, one for vmware and one for virtualbox
2007-10-27T07:23:00.000Z	LiMaO	tiago	i'm not sure about that converter though, i myself never tried it
2007-10-27T07:23:00.000Z	tiago	LiMaO	i might have to try this virtualbox people keep speaking of
2007-10-27T07:24:00.000Z	LiMaO	tiago	well, it's great, i can assure you
2007-10-27T07:25:00.000Z	tiago	LiMaO	is the performance better then vmware? and are there tools to improve guest os integration?
2007-10-27T07:26:00.000Z	LiMaO	tiago	as far as i'm concerned (considering lots of opinions all over the net), virtualbox is way better than vmware. runs faster, runs better.. i didn't try vmware myself, so i can't give you my opinion on that comparison, but yes virtualbox is great - for better os integration, it comes with virtualbox guest additions
2007-10-27T07:27:00.000Z	tiago	LiMaO	dystopianray, i think im sold :P
2007-10-27T07:27:00.000Z	LiMaO	tiago	http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Screenshots
2007-10-27T07:27:00.000Z	tiago	LiMaO	dystopianray has any one tryed running osx86 under virtual box?
2007-10-27T07:27:00.000Z	LiMaO	tiago	check out screenshots of vista running as guest on a linux host, and many other guest/host OS's combinations
2007-10-27T07:29:00.000Z	LiMaO	tiago	try virtualbox first.. then think if it's worth keeping vmware images ;)
2007-10-27T07:31:00.000Z	tiago	LiMaO	good advice  hehe
2007-10-27T07:31:00.000Z	LiMaO	tiago	btw, just out of curiosity (based on your name).. are you brazilian?
2007-10-27T07:32:00.000Z	tiago	LiMaO	Portuguese actually though i speak little of the language
2007-10-27T07:32:00.000Z	LiMaO	tiago	oh ok.. just asked because it's a known name =)
2007-10-27T07:33:00.000Z	tiago	LiMaO	thats cool mate, its funny hearing the many different pronunciations
