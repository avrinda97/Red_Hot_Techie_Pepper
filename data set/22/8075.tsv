2005-10-22T16:43:00.000Z	bluefox83		can someone sort out this sources.list entry for me? deb http://ftp.ale.org/pub/mirrors/ubuntu/ hoary hoary-backports hoary-security hoary-updates
2005-10-22T16:43:00.000Z	bluefox83		why the heck does ubuntu have everyone using sudo instead of just switching to root?
2005-10-22T16:44:00.000Z	bluefox83		sounds kind of assinine to me
2005-10-22T16:46:00.000Z	bluefox83		deb http://ftp.ale.org/pub/mirrors/ubuntu/ hoary hoary-backports hoary-security hoary-updates  <--what is wrong with that line?

2005-10-22T16:46:00.000Z	bluefox83		apt is built to use both http and ftp
2005-10-22T16:47:00.000Z	mwe	bluefox83	http://ftp. just sounds wrong to me
2007-04-26T12:14:00.000Z	mwe	bluefox83	the kernel will not upgraded in the repos
2007-04-26T12:14:00.000Z	bluefox83	mwe	why the furk not?
2007-04-26T12:14:00.000Z	mwe	bluefox83	because programs and kernel stay in the released versions
2007-04-26T12:14:00.000Z	bluefox83	mwe	what the heck does that mean?
2007-04-26T12:15:00.000Z	bluefox83	mwe	the current released versions of the software in the repos are the only versions that will ever be put in them?
2007-04-26T12:15:00.000Z	mwe	bluefox83	it means they extensively test versions of things before a release and that stability is more important than newest versions
2007-04-26T12:15:00.000Z	mwe	bluefox83	yes
2007-04-26T12:15:00.000Z	mwe	bluefox83	for a good reason
2007-04-26T12:16:00.000Z	bluefox83	mwe	does that also mean that we wont be getting the newest gaim? they changed names for 2.0.0 it's now pidgin
2007-04-26T12:16:00.000Z	mwe	bluefox83	yes
2007-04-26T12:16:00.000Z	mwe	bluefox83	some things are back-ported
2007-04-26T12:17:00.000Z	mwe	bluefox83	gaim is probably a good candidate
2007-04-26T12:17:00.000Z	bluefox83	mwe	yes i am correct, or yes we will be getting the new pidgin?
2007-04-26T12:17:00.000Z	mwe	bluefox83	yes, you are correct
2007-04-26T12:21:00.000Z	mwe	bluefox83	You will almost certainly be able to get the latest gaim either in backports or 3rd party repos
