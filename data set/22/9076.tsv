2005-03-21T17:11:00.000Z	InitMass		which is the best way to get sound out of all 6 of my speakers? i'm using alsa with esd
2005-03-21T17:12:00.000Z	djp	InitMass	Have you increased the wave suuround volume on your desktop?
2005-03-21T17:13:00.000Z	InitMass	djp	which control is that? i can't find it. but the volume is up in the gnome volume manager anyway
2005-03-21T17:14:00.000Z	djp	InitMass	right click on your volume control...
2005-03-21T17:14:00.000Z	djp	InitMass	click on open volume control...
2005-03-21T17:14:00.000Z	djp	InitMass	scroll through the alsa mixer and increase the wave surrond volume control
2005-03-21T17:15:00.000Z	djp	InitMass	that works for me in getting sound out of my 4.1 system
2005-03-21T17:17:00.000Z	InitMass	djp	i still can't find that wave setting. i'm using an external soundcard. but i've got an internal too
2005-03-21T17:18:00.000Z	InitMass	djp	if we begin with the tabs. there are two tabs called USB audio class driver (oss mixer) and then two called Intel 82801DB-ICH (alsa mixer)
2005-03-21T17:20:00.000Z	djp	InitMass	check the alsa mixer...
2005-03-21T17:20:00.000Z	djp	InitMass	what is your sound card by the way?
2005-03-21T17:22:00.000Z	InitMass	djp	the external is a hercules muse pocket
2005-03-21T17:28:00.000Z	InitMass	djp	if i type alsamixer -c 1 then i get No mixer elems found
2005-03-21T17:32:00.000Z	djp	InitMass	sorry, working here, so only ckecking in on the chat room when i can... does alsamixer open from the command line?
2005-03-21T17:32:00.000Z	InitMass	djp	yes. i choosed to do so
2005-03-21T17:35:00.000Z	djp	InitMass	this is now tricky due to the difference between soundcards. i have an sb live! so thing will be slightly different to you. try looking for wave, surround and pcm options and increase any volume levels that are not increased.
2005-03-21T17:38:00.000Z	InitMass	djp	but first off i have to make alsamixer use the external card and not the internal. when i start alsamixer it uses the internal and if i use alsamixer -c 1 which i think should be the external card i get the message No mixer elems found
2005-03-21T17:39:00.000Z	djp	InitMass	ahh, sorry. missed your earlier post. hmm... this is something i have not come across as i only use the one sound card.
2005-03-21T17:40:00.000Z	InitMass	djp	that step is very important. but hopefully i can take that step soon. unfortunately the people at #alsa are a sleep
2005-03-21T17:42:00.000Z	djp	InitMass	wake 'em up! best of luck. if i get come across an answer or somebody in a similar situation then i will try and help. good luck.
2005-03-21T17:43:00.000Z	InitMass	djp	thank you
2005-03-21T17:43:00.000Z	InitMass	djp	have a nice day
