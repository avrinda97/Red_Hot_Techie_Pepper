2007-12-24T18:31:00.000Z	chazco		Not too interested in learning right now, would rather have it working
2007-12-24T18:32:00.000Z	chazco		Mythtv doesnt work at all, despite being there... mysql wont go away (ive killed it for now, but it keeps restarting), no idea what else it started running
2007-12-24T18:33:00.000Z	chazco		No, it seriously doesnt work... Mysql errors from it, lock ups (on Linux!)...
2007-12-24T18:33:00.000Z	chazco		FInally made it start and it cant see my TV card (Kaffeine on Gnome can though)
2007-12-24T18:34:00.000Z	chazco		A total reinstall wont be too bad, just a hassle for packages that dont have .debs and rebuilding my TV card modules
2007-12-24T18:36:00.000Z	chazco		?
2007-12-24T18:36:00.000Z	chazco		I changed a setting (tcp_window_scaling) to fix it... i meant i dont know why it fixes it
2007-12-24T18:37:00.000Z	chazco		Yep, it doesnt help much
2007-12-24T18:38:00.000Z	chazco		sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras <-- that'll work right? (making a script to reinstall everything)
2007-12-24T18:39:00.000Z	chazco		Anyone know how to stop fsck running when on battery?
2007-12-24T18:39:00.000Z	brobostigon	chazco	no idea, sorry.

2008-02-24T23:48:00.000Z	brobostigon	chazco	try xmms or audacious, they already have all the codecs installed, you dont need to install all the codecs seperate

2008-02-24T23:51:00.000Z	chazco	brobostigon	- I answered you... think i'm having freenode issues. What i said was i'm trying to fix Totem ideally, but will try other apps if not
