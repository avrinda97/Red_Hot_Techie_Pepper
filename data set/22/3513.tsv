2009-10-10T06:03:00.000Z	Cyberworm	myron	thanks, I'll try that
2009-10-10T06:03:00.000Z	myron		cyberworm: no problem
2009-10-10T06:04:00.000Z	Cyberworm		but the problem is, I do have the drivers
2009-10-10T06:04:00.000Z	Cyberworm		and they are working
2009-10-10T06:04:00.000Z	Cyberworm		but they are not working that well without booting windows first
2009-10-10T06:06:00.000Z	myron		cyberworm: when you say without booting windows first, are you running ubuntu as a virtual machine?
2009-10-10T06:07:00.000Z	myron		cyberworm: or do you have a dual boot setup?
2009-10-10T06:07:00.000Z	Cyberworm		dual boot
2009-10-10T06:07:00.000Z	Cyberworm		I have to boot Ubuntu by booting Windows first, then restarting and booting Ubuntu, to get 100% performance
2009-10-10T06:07:00.000Z	myron		cyberworm: so you are saying that the card works better when you boot windows, shut it down and then boot ubuntu
2009-10-10T06:08:00.000Z	Cyberworm	myron	yes
2009-10-10T06:12:00.000Z	myron		cyberworm: that doesn't make any since at all. when a computer is rebooted, it clears all of the cache that is stored in the RAM. It would also clear the cache of your video card. Its like you are starting out with a blank slate on both...
2009-10-10T06:15:00.000Z	Cyberworm	myron	I know that it doesn't make sense, but it's just how it is :-/. Maybe I should note that I'm using a notebook. Maybe it's a PowrePlay problem
2009-10-10T06:15:00.000Z	myron		cyberworm: what are you seeing that tells you that your graphics card is functioning better when you run windows first?
2009-10-10T06:16:00.000Z	Cyberworm		fps from glxgears (ya I know...) and fps from several games
2009-10-10T06:16:00.000Z	myron		cyberworm: what brand notebook is it?
2009-10-10T06:16:00.000Z	Cyberworm		Toshiba
2009-10-10T06:16:00.000Z	Cyberworm		also gnome works better
2009-10-10T06:18:00.000Z	myron	Cyberworm	Is the factory os still installed, or did you format the entire hdd?
2009-10-10T06:18:00.000Z	Cyberworm		I formatted the entire hdd. There was Vista pre-installed and I don't like Vista :-/
2009-10-10T06:20:00.000Z	myron		cyberworm: have you tried installing ubuntu only? I have an hp notebook dualbooting with great luck. I actually think ubuntu runs smoother on it than windows xp.....
2009-10-10T06:21:00.000Z	Cyberworm	myron	no I haven't. It's my only computer and I'm mostly using it for playing games. But I do plan to remove Windows once I got a new desktop
