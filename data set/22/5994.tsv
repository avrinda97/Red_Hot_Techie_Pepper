2007-12-12T02:19:00.000Z	lakagna		No, it doesn't in Windows XP. I am using a Comtrend 536+ multiport router.
2007-12-12T02:20:00.000Z	lakagna		I tried sudo ifconfig eth0 down ... and then ifconfig eth0 up ... and it doesn't work.
2007-12-12T02:21:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	have you enabled azureus ports in virtual servers ?
2007-12-12T02:21:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	in your router ?
2007-12-12T02:22:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	is your router also a dhcp server ?
2007-12-12T02:22:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	then you need to configure a static ip address
2007-12-12T02:23:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168...  netmask 255.....  eth0 up
2007-12-12T02:24:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	and when you ifconfig it shows the proper ip address ? and netmask ?
2007-12-12T02:25:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	whats your router ip ?  and your static ip ? and the netmask ?
2007-12-12T02:26:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	seems good
2007-12-12T02:26:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	from windows it works fine ?
2007-12-12T02:26:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	or other OS ?
2007-12-12T02:27:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	yea, well if from windows it worked, it's not a tier 1 problem, in other words, hardware is fine
2007-12-12T02:28:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	you should be able to ping your router with:  ping 192.168.1.1
2007-12-12T02:29:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	did you try to enable dhcp on your router ? and leave your card on roaming mode ?
2007-12-12T02:30:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	i have router works fine for me
2007-12-12T02:30:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	and i have dhcp enabled... , but it's still weird, seems sort of like a time out problem
2007-12-12T02:31:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	check if your router doesn't have any timeout events enabled
2007-12-12T02:32:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	does this only happen when azureus is launched or bittorrent ?
2007-12-12T02:34:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	heh... ok , yea then network should be fine
2007-12-12T02:34:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	i would say to check on the enabled virtual servers and see if the ports are enabled for your host and forwarded properl
2007-12-12T02:34:00.000Z	juano__	lakagna	properly
