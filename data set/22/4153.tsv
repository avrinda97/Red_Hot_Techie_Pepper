2008-03-02T18:22:00.000Z	DellbuntuStudio5		Hi! Compiz makes windows act all wierd

2008-03-02T18:23:00.000Z	_Oz_		virtuaLbox
2008-03-02T18:23:00.000Z	DellbuntuStudio5	_Oz_	what's virtualbox?
2008-03-02T18:23:00.000Z	_Oz_	DellbuntuStudio5	never mind
2008-03-02T18:24:00.000Z	DellbuntuStudio5	_Oz_	Ubuntu was downloaded as an ISO and then burned to a CD
2008-03-02T18:25:00.000Z	_Oz_	DellbuntuStudio5	I understand
2008-03-02T18:25:00.000Z	_Oz_	DellbuntuStudio5	are you having compiz problems?
2008-03-02T18:25:00.000Z	_Oz_		actually I was just confused by his use of the word "windows" I think
2008-03-02T18:26:00.000Z	_Oz_		I was thinking he was running windows in a virtual machine and there are known conflicts between compiz and virtualbox
2008-03-02T18:26:00.000Z	_Oz_		but I think he just meant "windows" as in the windows of his applications in ubuntu, not windows itself
2008-03-02T18:27:00.000Z	DellbuntuStudio5		_Oz_:Compiz makes windows act all wierd. For example, The internet browser either becomes the background picture inside the window, or the background gets disorted. I'm running UbuntuStudio 7.10 with Compiz-Fusion 0.6.2
2008-03-02T18:27:00.000Z	_Oz_	DellbuntuStudio5	are you using KDE or Gnome?
2008-03-02T18:28:00.000Z	DellbuntuStudio5	_Oz_	I can only use Gnome! It's UbuntuStudio, not kubuntu im running!
2008-03-02T18:29:00.000Z	DellbuntuStudio5	_Oz_	Sorry. I'm Running Gnome
2008-03-02T18:29:00.000Z	_Oz_	DellbuntuStudio5	open a terminal and type "gnome-panels"
2008-03-02T18:30:00.000Z	DellbuntuStudio5	_Oz_	OK
2008-03-02T18:30:00.000Z	DellbuntuStudio5	_Oz_	The background got messed up, and i dont have wobbly windows effect on
2008-03-02T18:32:00.000Z	DellbuntuStudio5	_Oz_	It said "Bash: gnome-panels: command not found.
