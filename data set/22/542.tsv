2011-12-23T21:11:00.000Z	shiloh		im reading about MATE, is it possible to install mate on this?
2011-12-23T21:12:00.000Z	shiloh		i cant really use this at all
2011-12-23T21:14:00.000Z	auronandace	shiloh	try lxde or xfce or kde or even enlightenment
2011-12-23T21:14:00.000Z	auronandace	shiloh	xfce is my favourite
2011-12-23T21:14:00.000Z	shiloh	auronandace	never heard of enlightenment gui
2011-12-23T21:15:00.000Z	auronandace	shiloh	there is e16 and e17, e16 is the stable branch
2011-12-23T21:16:00.000Z	auronandace	shiloh	enlightenment is meant to be light on resources and rather flashy but i find it buggy and tacky looking
2011-12-23T21:16:00.000Z	shiloh	auronandace	well i didnt really want to hack this up and start adding dif gui's, unless i cant really customize this
2011-12-23T21:16:00.000Z	auronandace	shiloh	unity isn't very customisable, unless you want to break stuff
2011-12-23T21:16:00.000Z	auronandace	shiloh	gnome3 isn't much better either
2011-12-23T21:16:00.000Z	shiloh	auronandace	dont really need light, i have 8 gig ram
2011-12-23T21:17:00.000Z	auronandace	shiloh	its new
2011-12-23T21:18:00.000Z	auronandace	shiloh	unity isn't the way i'd use a computer (it tends to be better for touchscreens and netbooks)
2011-12-23T21:18:00.000Z	shiloh	auronandace	i understand new, and am fine with new, im not fine with limited cause i need to actually use my pc
2011-12-23T21:19:00.000Z	auronandace	shiloh	i like to use my pc too, which is why i don't use unity
2011-12-23T21:20:00.000Z	auronandace	shiloh	i highly recomend xfce, thats rather customisable and gtk based
2011-12-23T21:44:00.000Z	shiloh	auronandace	thank you for the help, im thinking its time for me to leave ubuntu and move on, i cant use this
2011-12-23T21:50:00.000Z	shiloh	auronandace	no im going to stay with gnome, i like gnome, i just cant use this GUI like this, i cant use a limited desktop. im dl'ing debian
2011-12-23T21:51:00.000Z	auronandace	shiloh	by gnome do you mean gnome2?
2011-12-23T21:51:00.000Z	shiloh	auronandace	no debian testing is gnome 3
2011-12-23T21:51:00.000Z	auronandace	shiloh	oh, i find gnome3 just as unusable as unity ::)
2011-12-23T21:58:00.000Z	auronandace	shiloh	kde also uses qt rather than gtkm but xfce uses gtk just like gnome
