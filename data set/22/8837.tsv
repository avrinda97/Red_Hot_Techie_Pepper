2005-05-10T14:18:00.000Z	mpq		I'm too used to gnome
2005-05-10T14:19:00.000Z	mpq		I don't want to learn to use something else
2005-05-10T14:20:00.000Z	mpq		how different is KDE from gnome?
2005-05-10T14:20:00.000Z	mpq		I don't know how to install it
2005-05-10T14:21:00.000Z	mpq		that seems too easy
2005-05-10T14:22:00.000Z	mpq		okay
2005-05-10T14:22:00.000Z	mpq		downloading it now
2005-05-10T14:22:00.000Z	mpq		what happens once it finishes?
2005-05-10T14:23:00.000Z	mpq		ok
2005-05-10T14:23:00.000Z	mpq		there's more than two?
2005-05-10T14:23:00.000Z	jamie	mpq	there's tons
2005-05-10T14:24:00.000Z	jamie	mpq	there's enlightenment, xfce, ice, fluxbox, and a bunch of others
2005-05-10T14:25:00.000Z	mpq	jamie	maybe it's a driver thing?
2005-05-10T14:31:00.000Z	jamie	mpq	not exactly, but some work much more natively with gnome
2005-05-10T14:31:00.000Z	jamie	mpq	since you have gnome, you'll have the libraries you need to run things
2005-05-10T14:32:00.000Z	jamie	mpq	the vast majority of things will work happily in either
2005-05-10T14:32:00.000Z	jamie	mpq	you'll need to log out and select kde as your environment before logging back in
2005-05-10T14:33:00.000Z	jamie	mpq	do you know  how to restart x?
2005-05-10T14:33:00.000Z	jamie	mpq	log out first, then hit ctrl+alt+backspace
2005-05-10T14:34:00.000Z	jamie	mpq	x is short for X11, the windowing system in linux
2005-05-10T14:35:00.000Z	jamie	mpq	sort of...  the desktop environment is a big set of things sitting on top of x
2005-05-10T14:46:00.000Z	jamie	mpq	usually gnome menu stuff is in a submenu in gnome
