2008-12-30T20:59:00.000Z	kitply		hi all, I have a samsung mp3 player, but when I connect it to the USB port Ubuntu 8.10 doesnt seem to identify it and the mp3 player starts charging instead. Are there any drivers available for this mp3 player for Ubuntu OS
2008-12-30T21:00:00.000Z	hspaans	kitply	what do you expect? it needs to be connected to rhythmbox?
2008-12-30T21:01:00.000Z	hspaans	kitply	do you see it as a storage device?
2008-12-30T21:02:00.000Z	kitply	hspaans	no i dont see it as a storage device
2008-12-30T21:02:00.000Z	kitply	hspaans	i would lik to see it as a storage device to copy/paste songs
2008-12-30T21:03:00.000Z	hspaans	kitply	plug it in and the send the output of the following command to pastebin : dmesg | tail && lsusb

2008-12-30T21:07:00.000Z	hspaans	kitply	your sure that it has real usb support?
2008-12-30T21:08:00.000Z	kitply	hspaans	I went to the samsung website to find suitable drivers/firmware for linux os. But they have only posted drivers for different Windows versions
2008-12-30T21:09:00.000Z	kitply	hspaans	this mp3 player was recognised by windows earlieronly after i had installed the specified drivers. But now i dont have a windows os. I use only linux
2008-12-30T21:10:00.000Z	hspaans	kitply	has the mp3 player also real name?
2008-12-30T21:11:00.000Z	kitply	hspaans	The real name of the player is Samsung Mp3 player ( model YPU2J)
2008-12-30T21:14:00.000Z	hspaans	kitply	it may work with MTP, but there appears to be a lot of issues with this device, both on Linux and on Windows
2008-12-30T21:15:00.000Z	kitply	hspaans	is there any other means that i can make ubuntu recognise it as a memory device. for eg: installing linux specific drivers or something of that sort?
2008-12-30T21:15:00.000Z	hspaans	kitply	it appears to be the MTP-route for you
2008-12-30T21:15:00.000Z	kitply	hspaans	what is MTP?
2008-12-30T21:16:00.000Z	hspaans	kitply	media transfer protocol
2008-12-30T21:17:00.000Z	kitply	hspaans	So do i have to install the MTP using apt command?
2008-12-30T21:19:00.000Z	hspaans	kitply	maybe, I'm not using MTP
2008-12-30T21:20:00.000Z	kitply	hspaans	Will I get any information regarding MTP in the Ubuntu wiki/forums?
