2007-05-15T06:57:00.000Z	mcn06		Hi
2007-05-15T06:57:00.000Z	mcn06		I'm running a toshiba laptop with ubuntu
2007-05-15T06:57:00.000Z	mcn06		I'm finding the fan isn't managed particularly well for the cpu
2007-05-15T06:57:00.000Z	mcn06		i.e.
2007-05-15T06:57:00.000Z	mcn06		it's either on 0 or full power
2007-05-15T06:57:00.000Z	mcn06		wheras in windows the speed is gradual and reflects how much work the comp is doing
2007-05-15T06:58:00.000Z	Pelo	mcn06	there are instructions here on fan control and cpu freq   http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty
2007-05-15T07:01:00.000Z	mcn06	Pelo	: I get the error whilst trying to do step 3 in the wiki "sudo modprobe speedstep-centrino
2007-05-15T07:02:00.000Z	Pelo	mcn06	lsmod  see if there is already a whatchamacallit running
2007-05-15T07:03:00.000Z	mcn06	Pelo	there's a number of cpu_freq processes
2007-05-15T07:03:00.000Z	Pelo	mcn06	  try  modprobe -r  processname to remove them one by one and then install the right one
2007-05-15T07:04:00.000Z	mcn06	Pelo	are you sure this won't potentially damage my system in any way?
2007-05-15T07:05:00.000Z	Pelo	mcn06	 if you are just removing the cpufreq process it will only stop your cpu freq from being adjusted
2007-05-15T07:06:00.000Z	mcn06	Pelo	trying to end one of them, I get "FATAL : Module is in use"
2007-05-15T07:06:00.000Z	Pelo	mcn06	  "processname stop" to stop the process,
2007-05-15T07:07:00.000Z	mcn06	Pelo	what's the command? "modprobe processname stop" doesn't seem to work
2007-05-15T07:07:00.000Z	Pelo	mcn06	 just processname stop,   like cpufreq-set stop , or whatever the process the system manager tells you is running
2007-05-15T07:08:00.000Z	Pelo	mcn06	 we're getting in to stuff I am not comfortable with here
2007-05-15T07:08:00.000Z	mcn06	Pelo	fair enough, just trying the stop command though it doesn't seem to work
2007-05-15T07:11:00.000Z	Pelo	mcn06	 congrats
2007-05-15T07:12:00.000Z	Pelo	mcn06	 there is also a file you can edit to make sure that is wath is loaded as default
2007-05-15T07:13:00.000Z	Pelo	mcn06	  check in the wiki it's part of the proceedure, it's a file you add about 5 lines to ,  in etc/init.d/cpufreq or soemthing
