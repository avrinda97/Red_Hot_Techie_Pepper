2011-01-15T00:58:00.000Z	zaery	grantsmith	it works fine on my desktop, sorry if this sounds condescending, but are you holding the mouse button down while dragging?
2011-01-15T00:58:00.000Z	grantsmith	zaery	yes i am. are you dragging from the wochspace switcher though ?
2011-01-15T00:59:00.000Z	grantsmith		workspace*
2011-01-15T00:59:00.000Z	zaery	grantsmith	oh i thought you were talking about things on the desktop. right click the desktop switcher, is it locked?
2011-01-15T01:00:00.000Z	zaery	grantsmith	oh, you wanted to drag an application from one workspace to another, using the desktop, right? that works fine for me, too
2011-01-15T01:00:00.000Z	grantsmith	zaery	the "lock to panel" doesnt seem to make a difference for me
2011-01-15T01:01:00.000Z	zaery	grantsmith	you can always just rightclick the title bar and select "move to workspace...."
2011-01-15T01:01:00.000Z	grantsmith	zaery	I can drag just fine on the workspace, but not within the workspace switcher
2011-01-15T01:02:00.000Z	grantsmith	zaery	and the hover tooltip just says "click to start dragging" lol
2011-01-15T01:02:00.000Z	zaery	grantsmith	well i can drag things from one workspace to another using the workspace switcher
2011-01-15T01:03:00.000Z	grantsmith	zaery	Hmmm.. wonder why i cant
2011-01-15T01:03:00.000Z	grantsmith	zaery	in fact I have two computers with ubuntu installed and neither one can
2011-01-15T01:04:00.000Z	zaery	grantsmith	are they of the same make/model/brand, and both of the same ubuntu version? It could be because i'm still on 10.04
2011-01-15T01:05:00.000Z	grantsmith	zaery	both on 10.4.1
2011-01-15T01:06:00.000Z	zaery	grantsmith	what computers are they?
2011-01-15T01:06:00.000Z	grantsmith	zaery	different hardware, but both 64bit
2011-01-15T01:07:00.000Z	zaery	grantsmith	i've got 32-bit
2011-01-15T01:07:00.000Z	grantsmith	zaery	ok, thanks.. i'll see if google can help :/
2011-01-15T01:08:00.000Z	zaery		anyone with 64-bit ubuntu 10.04 wanna drag an app from one workspace to another using the workspace switcher real quick?
2011-01-15T01:09:00.000Z	zaery		http://paste.ubuntu.com/554142/ is in my fstab, and i imported ssh keys to my other computer according to this: http://pkeck.myweb.uga.edu/ssh/ but it still won't mount my network drive on boot, can anyone help?
2011-01-15T01:11:00.000Z	grantsmith	zaery	it looks like a problem with Compiz. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8880489
2011-01-15T01:13:00.000Z	zaery	grantsmith	well, seeing as i don't have compiz on, that'd make sense
