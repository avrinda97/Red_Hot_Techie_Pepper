2012-09-21T14:45:00.000Z	J-man	wishin_master	jockey-gtk will help you maybe
2012-09-21T14:46:00.000Z	J-man		my bad :)
2012-09-21T14:47:00.000Z	wishin_master	J-man	is that a s/w?
2012-09-21T14:48:00.000Z	J-man	wishin_master	Yeah, it's a program which will search for additional drivers
2012-09-21T14:49:00.000Z	J-man	wishin_master	Or try the package bcmwl-kernel-source
2012-09-21T14:50:00.000Z	J-man	wishin_master	apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source; after you have that try jockey-gtk
2012-09-21T14:52:00.000Z	wishin_master	J-man	i tried activating the sta drivers from additional drivers but it didn't help.it says firmeware missing.
2012-09-21T14:53:00.000Z	J-man	wishin_master	What Ubuntu version are you using?
2012-09-21T14:53:00.000Z	wishin_master	J-man	12.04
2012-09-21T14:53:00.000Z	J-man	wishin_master	Try: modprobe -r b43 ssb wl;modprobe wl
2012-09-21T14:54:00.000Z	wishin_master	J-man	i have added b43 in the /etc/modules/ as well
2012-09-21T14:56:00.000Z	J-man	wishin_master	Hmm I had a bcm4300; it worked pretty much out of the box for me not sure what is going wrong
2012-09-21T14:58:00.000Z	wishin_master	J-man	once actionparsnip told me to add b43 to /etc/modules file then it started working fine but i recently formatted the sys since then i am not able to commect through wireless.
2012-09-21T14:58:00.000Z	J-man	wishin_master	You can try lspci -vvv and see which driver it tries to use and blacklist that in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
2012-09-21T14:59:00.000Z	J-man	wishin_master	Or revert the changes in /etc/modules and see what happens
2012-09-21T15:00:00.000Z	wishin_master	J-man	when i was using 10.04 at that time i tried blacklisting the drivers.
