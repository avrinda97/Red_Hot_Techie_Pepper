2005-04-10T08:56:00.000Z	peyre		Please someone help with upgrading from warty to hoary.
2005-04-10T08:56:00.000Z	eyequeue	peyre	 state the actual problem
2005-04-10T08:59:00.000Z	eyequeue	peyre	 package is installed properly here
2005-04-10T08:59:00.000Z	eyequeue	peyre	 rm the file and let it fetch it anew
2005-04-10T09:00:00.000Z	peyre	eyequeue	I've tried everything. How do I rm the file from the cache?
2005-04-10T09:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	peyre	 sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/diveintopython_5.4-1ubuntu1_all.deb
2005-04-10T09:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	peyre	 follow that with sudo apt-get --reinstall install diveintopython
2005-04-10T09:01:00.000Z	peyre	eyequeue	ok, hang on while I try that.
2005-04-10T09:02:00.000Z	eyequeue	peyre	 sure
2005-04-10T09:05:00.000Z	peyre	eyequeue	I got the same error, but then it did something else.
2005-04-10T09:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	peyre	 what would that be?
2005-04-10T09:06:00.000Z	peyre	eyequeue	peyre@PTL-Mobile:~ $ sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/diveintopython_5.4-1ubuntu1_all.deb
2005-04-10T09:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	peyre	no, i sked what it did, but anywy, let's move on
2005-04-10T09:09:00.000Z	eyequeue	peyre	 apparently your old dpkg package couldn't handle bzip2, just gzip, but the new can.  sooooo, plese try one more time (sorry) running sudo apt-get --reinstall install diveintopython
2005-04-10T09:11:00.000Z	peyre	eyequeue	Ok, that seemed to work. No errors anyway. Now, should I run dist-upgrade again?
2005-04-10T09:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	peyre	 yes, you managed to notice a problem though, so please consider reporting it on bugzilla so they cn fix it in time for the final release on 8 april
2005-04-10T09:13:00.000Z	peyre	eyequeue	yes, I will do so. Thank you for your help. Have yourself a cup of java. :-)
2005-04-10T09:23:00.000Z	peyre	eyequeue	are you still there? (I promise I won't flood. :-)
2005-04-10T09:24:00.000Z	eyequeue	peyre	 still here, coffee not quite done yet
2005-04-10T09:25:00.000Z	peyre	eyequeue	I got past the dpkg error, but now I am getting messages about also and bogofilter. The dist-upgrade still won't go through.
2005-04-10T09:26:00.000Z	peyre	eyequeue	sorry, I meant alsa.
2005-04-10T09:27:00.000Z	eyequeue	peyre	 right
