2008-10-17T09:01:00.000Z	[TiZ]		I'm trying to close up my customized liveCD so I can see how big it is before I go any further. But I can't do "sudo umount edit/dev". It tells me that the "device is busy." What do I do?

2008-10-17T09:09:00.000Z	[TiZ]		I'm not a bot. But I am severely annoyed.
2008-10-17T09:09:00.000Z	[TiZ]		And it's the same time I come in here too.
2008-10-17T09:10:00.000Z	[TiZ]		Each and every time, I come in here with a problem. I try to be patient and wait. I even help others while I wait! But no matter what, I am ignored, all the time! I'm sick of it!
2008-10-17T09:11:00.000Z	[TiZ]		I understand you're all volunteers and you don't HAVE to help me. But I've been in here like, 15 times with the same result each time.

2008-10-17T09:12:00.000Z	[TiZ]		I'm using the guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization, and I mounted edit/dev with sudo mount --bind /dev/ edit/dev
2008-10-17T09:12:00.000Z	Agent_bob	[TiZ]	find what is still in the mounted fs and close it
2008-10-17T09:12:00.000Z	Agent_bob	[TiZ]	a terminal or anything will hold a mount
2008-10-17T09:13:00.000Z	Agent_bob	[TiZ]	a terminal or anything will hold a mount, mounted  i should say.
2008-10-17T09:13:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Agent_bob	Okay. I'll close out my nautilus, gedit, and gnome-terminals.
2008-10-17T09:15:00.000Z	Agent_bob	[TiZ]	if it's any consolation, i put linux on a bootable flash stick   but i don't recall ever using it sense then.
2008-10-17T09:16:00.000Z	Agent_bob	[TiZ]	fuser
2008-10-17T09:16:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Agent_bob	I'm just trying to make it so that I won't have to install all my apps whenever I reinstall. And for the learning experience.
2008-10-17T09:16:00.000Z	Agent_bob	[TiZ]	yeah that last part was why i did.
2008-10-17T09:17:00.000Z	Agent_bob	[TiZ]	anyway fuser can find what is holding it open.  and as i recall some times one may need to "losetup" the loop device to get a clean dismount of loopfs
2008-10-17T09:19:00.000Z	Agent_bob	[TiZ]	ummm i'd say it is busy then...
2008-10-17T09:20:00.000Z	Agent_bob	[TiZ]	sync and go for it.
2008-10-17T09:24:00.000Z	Agent_bob	[TiZ]	gooday
