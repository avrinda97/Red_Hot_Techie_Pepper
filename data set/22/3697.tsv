2008-06-24T06:52:00.000Z	DrLame		Is ubuntu pretty friendly with wireless internet cards?
2008-06-24T06:52:00.000Z	bazhang	DrLame	what card
2008-06-24T06:53:00.000Z	DrLame	bazhang	it's built into the motherboard. Let me look it up real quick
2008-06-24T06:53:00.000Z	bazhang	DrLame	lspci in the terminal will tell you (just the one line)
2008-06-24T06:54:00.000Z	bazhang	DrLame	yes
2008-06-24T06:54:00.000Z	DrLame	bazhang	I don't think it's pci tho =X Think it'd still list?
2008-06-24T06:55:00.000Z	bazhang	DrLame	the lsusb :)
2008-06-24T06:57:00.000Z	DrLame	bazhang	cool =) lsusb will tell me if it's compatible? Or just what it sees it as so I can search for drivers? or...? Sry, new to linux
2008-06-24T06:57:00.000Z	bazhang	DrLame	that will tell us how good it is so we can tell you :)
2008-06-24T06:58:00.000Z	DrLame	bazhang	cool =) I'm gonna format a 320 gig hdd here in a min to use for linux. What do you reccomend I install?
2008-06-24T06:58:00.000Z	bazhang	DrLame	first tell us the output of lsusb for that nic :)
2008-06-24T06:59:00.000Z	DrLame	bazhang	I'm on windows at the moment =) Gonna set up a dual boot to linux. I guess I could dig out my old old ubuntu boot cd to see or something?
2008-06-24T07:00:00.000Z	bazhang	DrLame	or just look it up in the windows info (somewhere)
2008-06-24T07:01:00.000Z	bazhang	DrLame	is there no internal wireless on that?
2008-06-24T07:02:00.000Z	bazhang	DrLame	nah, you got it right the first time :)
2008-06-24T07:02:00.000Z	DrLame	bazhang	it's attached to the motherboard internally. It's not an external usb
2008-06-24T07:03:00.000Z	bazhang	DrLame	best way to find out is to boot up live cd and check if it sees your card :)
2008-06-24T07:03:00.000Z	bazhang	DrLame	same difference :)
2008-06-24T07:04:00.000Z	DrLame	bazhang	is there a link to the live cd handy?
2008-06-24T07:06:00.000Z	DrLame	bazhang	is Hardy Heron what I should be downloading?
2008-06-24T07:07:00.000Z	bazhang	DrLame	you might try gutsy, and if that goes well then hardy, really up to you though
2008-06-24T07:12:00.000Z	bazhang	DrLame	#ubuntu-offtopic for chatting :)
