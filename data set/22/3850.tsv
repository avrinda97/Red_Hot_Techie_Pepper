2009-04-30T16:18:00.000Z	zetheroo		I am finding the packaging management apps in jaunty, both in Kubuntu and Ubuntu, to be very unstable and glitchy ... sometimes getting stuck while reloading the sources, opening to no available packages or spitting out errors about something having crashed somewhere ...
2009-04-30T16:19:00.000Z	zetheroo		this is happening on two seperate machines with fresh installs and having reinstalled several times from USB flash disk and CD
2009-04-30T16:20:00.000Z	daftykins	zetheroo	how does package management perform from command line?
2009-04-30T16:23:00.000Z	daftykins	zetheroo	to be honest everything works absolutely fine here. just slow mirrors after release day, but that's all settled down for me where i am
2010-05-04T06:55:00.000Z	daftykins	zetheroo	how to do it? see samba
2010-05-04T06:57:00.000Z	zetheroo	daftykins	yeah ... I have been through all of that so many times .. but no sooner do I have it set up then it ceases to work suddenly
2010-05-04T06:58:00.000Z	daftykins	zetheroo	it might be worth talking to samba people about your config
2010-05-04T06:58:00.000Z	daftykins	zetheroo	could also be a driver issue with your server's given LAN interface
2010-05-04T06:59:00.000Z	daftykins	zetheroo	pretty sure hardy (8.04) still has a bit of support left, could be worth keeping it going
2010-05-04T07:00:00.000Z	zetheroo	daftykins	just extremely annoying that there are all these options in the GUI to share files and folders, but none of it works withotu tinkering in the background anyway
2010-05-04T07:00:00.000Z	zetheroo	daftykins	I left 8.04 a while back ...
2010-05-04T07:01:00.000Z	daftykins	zetheroo	ah i see just the GUI stuff, mmm that and properly configured samba will be totally different
2010-05-04T07:01:00.000Z	zetheroo	daftykins	exactly ... I think all that rubbish GUI stuff should be banished until it actually works!
2010-05-04T07:02:00.000Z	zetheroo	daftykins	its totally misleading ...
2010-05-04T07:02:00.000Z	daftykins	zetheroo	i know it works for some, plus things can't be trialled unless they're included. i understand your point though
2010-05-04T07:02:00.000Z	zetheroo	daftykins	although in 8.04 and prior to that it actually seemed to work pretty well .... I don't know what happened since then to mess it all up
2010-05-04T07:06:00.000Z	zetheroo	daftykins	my household has a shared MF unit as well as a lot of media content that we are used to having shared over the network ... and with Windows it all works 80 - 90 percent of the time ... whereas with Linux it's the complete opposite ... makes it very hard to use Linux at all with those issues ... I have even been over the Ubuntu docs and what I have seen is all really old material ...
2010-05-04T07:07:00.000Z	daftykins	zetheroo	i am totally not a Linux fanboy, i actually run windows 7 on my desktop at the moment, but i genuinely believe there to be more than just Ubuntu or Linux to blame there
2010-05-04T07:08:00.000Z	zetheroo	daftykins	how so ...
2010-05-04T07:08:00.000Z	daftykins	zetheroo	well if i'm reading you right, you refer to a multi-function printer device, those have shocking Linux support at the best of times
2010-05-04T07:09:00.000Z	zetheroo	daftykins	the one I have works very very well and has Linux support
2010-05-04T07:09:00.000Z	zetheroo	daftykins	it's an Epson
