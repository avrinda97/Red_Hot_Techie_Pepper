2008-04-25T10:09:00.000Z	mattycoze		hey does anyone know whether the Envy works in Ubuntu 8.04
2008-04-25T10:10:00.000Z	amirman84	mattycoze	from what i've heard you need a specific version of envy called envyNG for 8.04
2008-04-25T10:10:00.000Z	mattycoze	amirman84	is that in Synaptic?
2008-04-25T10:12:00.000Z	amirman84	mattycoze	i downloaded it off of their website but it didn't work for me but that was because i was using the older version of wubi for 8.04 that never finished the install. have you tried allowing backports and proposed packages in software sources?
2008-04-25T10:13:00.000Z	mattycoze	amirman84	no i haven't
2008-04-25T10:13:00.000Z	mattycoze	amirman84	what's the software repository i have to add in synaptic?
2008-04-25T10:14:00.000Z	mattycoze	amirman84	or is it already in the list
2008-04-25T10:15:00.000Z	mattycoze	amirman84	(i'm currently trying to download it from the software backports from synaptic; just letting it refresh the list; which is taking an unbelievably long time; perhaps becausethe server is being nuked atm)
2008-04-25T10:15:00.000Z	amirman84	mattycoze	i would STRONGLY recommend going into SYSTEM > ADMINISTRATION > SOFTWARE SOURCES and enabling "proprietary drivers for devices (restricted)" , "software restricted by copyright and legal issues (multiverse)" under the Ubuntu software tab
2008-04-25T10:16:00.000Z	mattycoze	amirman84	why so strongly recommended?
2008-04-25T10:16:00.000Z	amirman84	mattycoze	also allow third party software and proposed and backports under the updates tab
2008-04-25T10:17:00.000Z	amirman84	mattycoze	because i've spent weeks trying to get my wireless and graphics card to be supported in ubuntu, going through all the hassle of combing the forums and messing with code i had no idea about in the terminal when i didn't need to, when i allowed those software sources the drivers came in automatically and installed painlessly only requiring one reboot
2008-04-25T10:18:00.000Z	mattycoze	amirman84	oh
2008-04-25T10:19:00.000Z	mattycoze	amirman84	are you in aus? the sudo apt-get update process lags heaps on au.archive.ubuntu.com
2008-04-25T10:20:00.000Z	amirman84	mattycoze	no i'm in the US
2008-04-25T10:20:00.000Z	mattycoze	amirman84	reckon it'll be right if i change the server?
2008-04-25T10:24:00.000Z	mattycoze	amirman84	i get this from planet mirror; Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead. (plus a whole load of "failed to fetch")
2008-04-25T10:25:00.000Z	amirman84	mattycoze	i've gotten a similar thing before, i just ignored it like it was no big deal
2008-04-25T10:25:00.000Z	amirman84	mattycoze	keep in mind i'm a total noob but my system is running extremely stable so far
2008-04-25T10:31:00.000Z	mattycoze	amirman84	aha! success, it installed nicely
2008-04-25T10:31:00.000Z	mattycoze	amirman84	and happens to be working
2008-04-25T10:31:00.000Z	amirman84	mattycoze	awesome, i'm glad you were saved of the headaches i went through
