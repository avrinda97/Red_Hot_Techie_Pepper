2007-12-10T21:48:00.000Z	TBotNik_u		All:  Have a sound problem.  About 12 installs attemps now.  Always fails.  What I think, after watching the installs go by several times, is that there are certain directories needed and the permission have to be right, and I think they either do not get created or the permissions are not correctly set.  I'm trying to learn where the install writes it's log, so I can see what write errors occur and try to correct these.
2007-12-10T21:48:00.000Z	RedHeron	TBotNik_u	try: sudo atp-get install esound
2007-12-10T21:50:00.000Z	TBotNik_u	RedHeron	Little misspell there, but corrected and watching the install.
2007-12-10T21:50:00.000Z	RedHeron	TBotNik_u	had the same problem, that was my solution.
2007-12-10T21:51:00.000Z	TBotNik_u	RedHeron	Hope it works for me!
2007-12-10T21:56:00.000Z	TBotNik_u	RedHeron	Got msg "After unpacking 102kB of additional disk space will be used." but it did not install only downloaded.  What else is needed or do I re-init alsasound now?
2007-12-10T22:00:00.000Z	TBotNik_u	RedHeron	Re-ran alsa-info.sh.  PB at: http://pastebin.ca/811119.  Restarted alsa-utils, which restarted alsa, but still no sound.  What next?
2007-12-10T22:14:00.000Z	TBotNik_u	RedHeron	It never asked a Q
2007-12-10T22:14:00.000Z	TBotNik_u	RedHeron	Let me try again!
2007-12-10T22:15:00.000Z	TBotNik_u	RedHeron	Aha! Getting a "reading database thing now" did not do that before!
2007-12-10T22:16:00.000Z	TBotNik_u	RedHeron	Also got the "Unpacking" and "Setting Up" message, so restarted when it finished.  But still no sound.
2007-12-10T22:17:00.000Z	RedHeron	TBotNik_u	Try a reboot and see if that works,
2007-12-10T22:18:00.000Z	RedHeron	TBotNik_u	Shutting down sometimes helps.
2007-12-10T22:19:00.000Z	TBotNik_u	RedHeron	When I go to: <System> + <Preferences> + <Sound> and click to test get this error "audiotestsrc wave=sine freq=512 ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! gconfaudiosink: Could not open resource for writing.".  Also Speaker symbol still has the "/" for not active.
2007-12-10T22:20:00.000Z	RedHeron	TBotNik_u	Shutting down sometimes helps. Try restarting.
2007-12-10T22:22:00.000Z	TBotNik_u	RedHeron	The "alsa-info.sh" script errors looking for dir "/proc/asound" which it can not find.  Going to create that by hand and then try re-install.
2007-12-10T22:22:00.000Z	RedHeron	TBotNik_u	Just restart.
2007-12-10T22:27:00.000Z	TBotNik_u	RedHeron	When I do "mkdir /proc/asound" I get the error "mkdir: cannot create directory `/proc/asound': No such file or directory".  Wondering why?  Did "chmod 775 /proc" and no change.
2007-12-10T22:27:00.000Z	RedHeron	TBotNik_u	If you aren't willing to follow instructions, don't ask.
2007-12-10T22:28:00.000Z	TBotNik_u	RedHeron	Also have tons of numbered folders in "/proc".  Wonder if there is a directory number limit?
2007-12-10T22:29:00.000Z	RedHeron	TBotNik_u	Just restart.
2007-12-10T22:31:00.000Z	RedHeron	TBotNik_u	Just restart your computer and it will reconfig the sound with the new esound system, okay?
