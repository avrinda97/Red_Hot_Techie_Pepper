2010-12-22T15:18:00.000Z	FrozenKnight		How do I create a filter in synaptic? :D
2010-12-22T15:19:00.000Z	FrozenKnight		like, I'd like to be shown games that don't have "ball" in their name
2010-12-22T15:19:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	FrozenKnight	synaptic is like apt-cache search vs. sudo aptitude serch      more precise with aptitude i believe
2010-12-22T15:20:00.000Z	FrozenKnight	Us3r_Unfriendly	thanks, I have never used that search extensively, I should better find some tutorials somewhere.
2010-12-22T15:21:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	FrozenKnight	sudo apt-get install openshot
2010-12-22T15:21:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	FrozenKnight	it's like pitivi but easier with rendering
2010-12-22T15:23:00.000Z	FrozenKnight	Us3r_Unfriendly	thanks, saw it has something to do with regular expressions, I should be OK now :)
2010-12-22T15:23:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	FrozenKnight	your free to try it too
2010-12-22T15:24:00.000Z	FrozenKnight	Us3r_Unfriendly	it might actually help me... I was looking for a program like that the other day.
2010-12-22T15:26:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	FrozenKnight	Autonomiser:  I made this video with recordmydesktop and openshot
2010-12-22T15:53:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	FrozenKnight	what's the problem in aptitude?
2010-12-22T15:54:00.000Z	FrozenKnight	Us3r_Unfriendly	aptitude has no problem, the problem is me... I just can't figure out how to search for anything else than a precise term.
2010-12-22T15:54:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	FrozenKnight	apt-cache search video
2010-12-22T15:55:00.000Z	FrozenKnight	Us3r_Unfriendly	yeah, that's OK :) but how do I search not video :)
2010-12-22T15:55:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	FrozenKnight	how was the search output though?
2010-12-22T15:56:00.000Z	FrozenKnight	Us3r_Unfriendly	extensive (o.o)
2010-12-22T15:56:00.000Z	FrozenKnight	Us3r_Unfriendly	 cool.
2010-12-22T15:57:00.000Z	FrozenKnight	Us3r_Unfriendly	OK :) So here would be the thing I'm trying to achieve... I'm trying to show all the games, but hide those that come from kde :)
2010-12-22T16:01:00.000Z	FrozenKnight	Us3r_Unfriendly	!! Idea... apt-cache search games | grep "^kde"
2010-12-22T16:01:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	FrozenKnight	does that work better?
2010-12-22T16:02:00.000Z	FrozenKnight	Us3r_Unfriendly	bummer :/ I need to see how grep uses regular expressions.
2010-12-22T16:02:00.000Z	FrozenKnight	Us3r_Unfriendly	it showed me the groups of kdegames :D
