2007-10-06T15:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	yngone	dunno do "dpkg -L ipkungfu | less" to see the list of the files that the package installs
2007-10-06T15:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	yngone	how did you installed that package?
2007-10-06T15:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	yngone	'sudo apt-get install --reinstall ipkungfu'
2007-10-06T15:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	yngone	you have to use the one you instaled with apt-get not the one you downloaded to your desktop
2007-10-06T15:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	yngone	you can remove the one in your home safely
2007-10-06T15:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	yngone	no, now that it is installed you run it with 'sudo ipkungfu' no need to ut ./
2007-10-06T15:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	yngone	maybe it has a init script in /etc/init.d/
2007-10-06T15:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	yngone	too
2007-10-06T15:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	yngone	'sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash' and choose it not to be the default sh
2007-10-06T15:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	yngone	no
2007-10-06T16:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	yngone	try this first 'sudo /etc/init.d/ipkungfu start'
2007-10-06T16:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	yngone	to add it to the boot secuence do this 'sudo update-rc.d ipkungfu defaults'
2007-10-06T16:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	yngone	so it starts on every boot
2007-10-06T16:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	yngone	then everything is already set up
