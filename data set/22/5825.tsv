2007-07-28T15:35:00.000Z	ShackJack	Intensity	Refresh is not really the same phenomenon on LCDs as it is on CRTs - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate
2007-07-28T15:36:00.000Z	Intensity	ShackJack	What I am noticing now on my LCD is a kind of rescaling type effect.  I think that the monitor natively supports 1680x1050 but when it has to do 1600x1200, it has to choose an uneven correspondence of pixels (sometimes letting one pixel stand for two pixels in the translation).
2007-07-28T15:55:00.000Z	ShackJack	Intensity	Nope, see http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty#How_to_Correct_the_Graphics_Resolution_.28Intel.29
2007-07-28T15:57:00.000Z	Intensity	ShackJack	Is it possible that my monitor might support something more than 1680x1050?  That was the maximum I could see as an option in Windows.  I'm trying to find the model number on this Lenovo monitor that I have.  It seems fairly big.
2007-07-28T15:57:00.000Z	ShackJack	Intensity	True - but size doesn't matter... You should look up specs and see... Manuafacturer site will likely have it..
2007-07-29T16:05:00.000Z	Intensity	ShackJack	Okay, I've done all of the 915resolution configuration as suggested on the page.  Now the only thing I have yet to do is to decide what to do with xorg.conf.  Should I do another dpkg-reconfigure and assume that Debian will now understand there to be available a higher mode?  Or should I patch my existing xorg.conf?  In the latter situation, I guess I should leave the HorizSync at 28-96 and VertRefresh at 43-60 (I thi

2007-07-29T16:08:00.000Z	ShackJack	Intensity	jowi: I usuallt just ut the desired resolution first in xorg.conf and "force" the refresh values --- VertRefresh 80.0-80.0 etc...
2007-07-29T16:09:00.000Z	ShackJack	Intensity	Erm... should be 24 :)
2007-07-29T16:09:00.000Z	Intensity	ShackJack	Okay, so it seems to be fine (the 915resolution output at least).
2007-07-29T16:16:00.000Z	ShackJack	Intensity	see ubuntu guide :) ... 24 should be default depth...
2007-07-29T16:18:00.000Z	ShackJack	Intensity	Yeah check out font settings, subpixel rendering, etc... And I use Vista's candara as default font - pretty!
2007-07-29T16:18:00.000Z	Intensity	ShackJack	What do you mean by subpixel rendering?
2007-07-29T16:19:00.000Z	ShackJack	Intensity	See font settings... Prefs
2007-07-29T16:19:00.000Z	Intensity	ShackJack	Okay.  Do you know whether I might be able to get 1680x1050 in SVGA or framebuffer versions of VNC?  Or do I need to run X?
2007-07-29T16:20:00.000Z	ShackJack	Intensity	SOrry, can't tell you that :)
2007-07-29T16:21:00.000Z	Intensity	ShackJack	I'm connection to my previous vnc session at 1680x1050, and it's certainly fuzzier.  I am using an older laptop, but there has to be a reason for the greater fuziness.  I didn't expect that.  Could it be that my refresh rate might be too low?
2007-07-29T16:21:00.000Z	ShackJack	Intensity	Fuzziness in type - check font settings - fuzziness in everything - confirm you are at right res...
2007-07-29T16:23:00.000Z	Intensity	ShackJack	It can't be the font settings, because the VNC session has been kept alive in between the switch I made to a new laptop (it's a desktop that's still been running during the switch).  And, I am definitely at the correct resolution.  Thus, it seems to be a matter of the quality of the laptop's video card, or the settings that are being used to render 1680x1050 (there may be more than one refresh rate possible to render
2007-07-29T16:47:00.000Z	ShackJack	Intensity	Jiggle the cord! :)
2007-07-29T16:47:00.000Z	Intensity	ShackJack	I'd rather jiggle the laptop. :)
2007-07-29T16:48:00.000Z	Intensity	ShackJack	The laptop's pretty old...  But I can do a quick test - the third laptop I have is in between the ages of the two laptops, and it has etch installed on it.  So all I have to do is repeat the tweaks, and attempt to run the resolution as a comparison.
