2010-10-03T19:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alex_____	what wifi chip does the laptop has?
2010-10-03T19:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alex_____	lspci | grep -i net
2010-10-03T19:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alex_____	in a terminal
2010-10-03T19:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alex_____	anything else? maybe that's the wired nic
2010-10-03T19:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alex_____	that's the one
2010-10-03T19:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alex_____	are you connected to internet via wired?
2010-10-03T19:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alex_____	can you connect the laptop to internet somehow? just for a while
2010-10-03T19:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alex_____	:( that complicates the procedure a lot...
2010-10-03T19:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alex_____	we need to install the firmware for the card.
2010-10-03T19:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alex_____	if you can connect the laptop to internet is just « sudo aptitude install b43-fwcutter » and reboot
2010-10-03T19:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alex_____	but offline install is much complex
2010-10-03T19:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alex_____	you have to install b43-fwcutter from the ubuntu cd ( or downloading it from packages.ubuntu.com ) then download the fimware files and run a few commands
