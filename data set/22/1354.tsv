2010-06-14T06:15:00.000Z	tomreyn	varunthacker	so websites you cannot access are piratebay.org and others. can you provide some others? you can send them by /query (PM) if you like, but please let's continue here later.
2010-06-14T06:15:00.000Z	tomreyn	varunthacker	piratebay.org is not a particularly good site for testing against since it happens to be down regularly
2010-06-14T06:16:00.000Z	varunthacker	tomreyn	i can't even visit my blog :http://varunthacker.wordpress.com/
2010-06-14T06:18:00.000Z	tomreyn	varunthacker	what'S the error message firefox gives you?
2010-06-14T06:20:00.000Z	varunthacker	tomreyn	its still loading up... on the bottom left cornor it says waiting for s0.wordpress.com . And i have realized i cannot visit ant wp hosted blogs
2010-06-14T06:25:00.000Z	tomreyn	varunthacker	please close all firefox windows, then open a terminal window and type this: firefox -no-remote -safe-mode http://varunthacker.wordpress.com/
2010-06-14T06:26:00.000Z	tomreyn	varunthacker	then, _without_ ticking any of the checkboxes, click on "continue in safe mode"
2010-06-14T06:26:00.000Z	tomreyn	varunthacker	does your website fully load then?
2010-06-14T06:31:00.000Z	varunthacker	tomreyn	unfortunately no. Same message waiting for s0.wordpress.com
2010-06-14T06:31:00.000Z	tomreyn	varunthacker	can you access http://s0.wordpress.com ?
2010-06-14T06:35:00.000Z	varunthacker	tomreyn	now it says waiting for s0.wp.com. is it got to do with the last post on the forum i posted?
2010-06-14T06:38:00.000Z	tomreyn	varunthacker	the last post you have on the forum doesn't make much sense to me. please try this: open a terminal window, then type this and press enter when ready: nc -vv s0.wordpress.com 80
2010-06-14T06:39:00.000Z	tomreyn	varunthacker	you should then get to see this message: "Connection to s0.wordpress.com 80 port [tcp/www] succeeded!"
2010-06-14T06:39:00.000Z	varunthacker	tomreyn	i got that message
2010-06-14T06:39:00.000Z	tomreyn	varunthacker	if you get to see this message, please type this next: GET / HTTP/1.1
2010-06-14T06:39:00.000Z	tomreyn	varunthacker	then: Host: s0.wordpress.com
2010-06-14T06:40:00.000Z	tomreyn	varunthacker	then press enter twice
2010-06-14T06:41:00.000Z	tomreyn	varunthacker	you should then see this: http://pastebin.com/5S5VNT9C
2010-06-14T06:41:00.000Z	tomreyn	varunthacker	it's possible that your connection drops and you get bumped back to the shell if you type too slowly. if this happens then just restart from the 'nc' command above
