2004-10-13T15:10:00.000Z	crimsun		or simply use flac
2004-10-13T15:10:00.000Z	crimsun		etc.
2004-10-13T15:11:00.000Z	crimsun		now what's going to be interesting is how the FLAC 1.1.0 -> 1.1.1 transition occurs in Debian sid
2004-10-13T15:11:00.000Z	crimsun		there's a nice soname bump, and everything looks hairy
2004-10-13T15:12:00.000Z	jmhodges	crimsun	whats going on in the FLAC version bump that's causing hairyness?
2004-10-13T15:12:00.000Z	crimsun	jmhodges	.4 vs .6 for libflac4, and everything builds against the -dev
2004-10-14T05:15:00.000Z	crimsun	jmhodges	it has XFree86 4_3 branch + a ton of patches, so yes it supports XRANDR
2004-10-14T05:17:00.000Z	jmhodges	crimsun	ah, thanks
2005-01-14T11:15:00.000Z	crimsun	jmhodges	streamripper? ripcast?
2005-01-14T11:16:00.000Z	jmhodges	crimsun	streamripper is for shoutcast streams..
2005-01-14T11:18:00.000Z	crimsun	jmhodges	I'd grab them using mplayer's dump audio method
2005-01-14T11:19:00.000Z	jmhodges	crimsun	natch :)
2005-01-19T11:01:00.000Z	crimsun	jmhodges	don't use -scanbus
2005-01-19T11:02:00.000Z	jmhodges	crimsun	then what should i use?
2005-01-19T11:02:00.000Z	crimsun	jmhodges	use /dev/hdX directly
2005-01-19T11:02:00.000Z	crimsun	jmhodges	-dev=/dev/hdc for instance
2005-01-19T12:13:00.000Z	crimsun	jmhodges	you could use a bin+cue and cdrdao
2005-01-19T12:13:00.000Z	jmhodges	crimsun	eh?
2005-01-19T12:17:00.000Z	crimsun	jmhodges	the bin+cue & cdrdao reference is to create a bin+cue set of the audio
2005-01-19T12:17:00.000Z	jmhodges	crimsun	hmm. .neverdone that before
2005-01-23T11:15:00.000Z	jmhodges	crimsun	indeed
2005-01-29T12:57:00.000Z	crimsun	jmhodges	thanks to daniels, yes.
