2005-05-24T08:00:00.000Z	ogi_		Why does xmms hang when I try to play mp3's on it?
2005-05-24T08:00:00.000Z	Seveas	ogi_	because you need to change the output plugin to esd
2005-05-26T08:36:00.000Z	Seveas	ogi_	is it drm protected?
2005-05-26T08:36:00.000Z	ogi_	Seveas	 no idea..
2005-05-26T08:37:00.000Z	Seveas	ogi_	do other .wmv files work?
2005-05-26T08:38:00.000Z	Seveas	ogi_	then you probably need to fiddle with the mplayer config :)
2005-05-26T08:38:00.000Z	ogi_	Seveas	 not there either
2005-05-26T08:39:00.000Z	Seveas	ogi_	do you get an error when you start totem from a terminal and try to play the .wmv file?
2005-05-26T08:40:00.000Z	ogi_	Seveas	 how do I start if from terminal ? :)
2005-05-26T08:41:00.000Z	Seveas	ogi_	open a terminal (applications -> system tools -> terminal) and type: totem
2005-05-26T08:43:00.000Z	ogi_	Seveas	"there were no decoders found to handle the stream in file:....."

2005-05-26T08:46:00.000Z	Seveas	ogi_	did you install w32codecs?
2005-05-26T08:46:00.000Z	ogi_	Seveas	 yes
2005-05-26T08:52:00.000Z	ogi_	Seveas	 how do I find out if w32 are from marillat testing or unstable
2005-05-26T08:53:00.000Z	ogi_	Seveas	 20050412

2005-05-26T08:58:00.000Z	Seveas	ogi_	i have no idea, i can only say that it works for me, sorry...
2005-05-27T11:20:00.000Z	Seveas	ogi_	2.6.10-6
2005-06-03T16:54:00.000Z	Seveas	ogi_	put the .tgz file in ~/.xmms/Skins
2005-06-03T16:54:00.000Z	Seveas	ogi_	and try beep-media-player, it's a gtk2 port of xmms (ie: prettier)
2005-06-03T16:55:00.000Z	Seveas	ogi_	xmms plugins might work
