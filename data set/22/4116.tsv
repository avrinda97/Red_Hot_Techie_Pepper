2008-09-12T00:48:00.000Z	unfo	pisecx	what is your first language?
2008-09-12T00:48:00.000Z	pisecx	unfo	russian
2008-09-12T00:49:00.000Z	unfo	pisecx	did you know about #ubuntu-ru ? you may want to try them first, if they don't help you, try here
2008-09-12T00:49:00.000Z	pisecx	unfo	does it matter?
2008-09-12T00:49:00.000Z	pisecx	unfo	yes I know about ubuntu-ru. they know nothing about this problem, so I decided to ask here
2008-09-12T00:49:00.000Z	unfo	pisecx	it doesn't matter, but your question was hard to understand.
2008-09-12T00:49:00.000Z	unfo	pisecx	can you explain your question better?
2008-09-12T00:50:00.000Z	pisecx	unfo	sorry, I thought it's a know issue on a 8.10 better
2008-09-12T00:50:00.000Z	unfo	pisecx	what ubuntu are you using, what did you do, what happened, what did you expect should happen
2008-09-12T00:50:00.000Z	pisecx	unfo	http://news.softpedia.com/news/Ubuntu-8-10-Alpha-4-Screenshot-Tour-91907.shtml here is the description of new ubuntu 8.10 and they say about a bug with gnome look. I have the same, but has not found how to fix it.

2008-09-12T00:51:00.000Z	unfo	pisecx	no problem.  btw some free advice: you should use hardy instead, it works better for now :)
2008-09-12T00:52:00.000Z	pisecx	unfo	yes, I know, I use it. But I wanted to test a beta and install it on vmware machine
2008-09-12T00:52:00.000Z	unfo	pisecx	as you have seen, it still has bugs and is not ready for general public yet :)
