2006-12-03T17:11:00.000Z	MannyL		Hi I need some assistance. I have a PC with a SCSI Cd drive , IDE harddrives, no floppy and a nic that doesn't sup[ort network boots. The SCSI controller does not support bootable cd. Would someone help me get Ubuntu installed. It currently runs a dual boot of 2003 server and FreeDos but in Freedos it won't see the CD drive. I did copy the contents of the iso into the root of FreeDos's C
2006-12-03T17:13:00.000Z	carlfk	MannyL	when you say "nic dosn't support" have you seen the boot floppy that loads what is normaly in a PXE boot rom?

2006-12-03T17:15:00.000Z	MannyL	carlfk	how would I get that image into the system there is no floppy drive
2006-12-03T17:15:00.000Z	carlfk	MannyL	  ouch.  good q
2006-12-03T17:15:00.000Z	carlfk	MannyL	does it boot any linux right now?
2006-12-03T17:16:00.000Z	MannyL	carlfk	no just 2003 server and FreeDOS. To install FreeDos I had to put a 16 gig IDE drive in and use VMServer then mount the physical drive
2006-12-03T17:17:00.000Z	MannyL	carlfk	can I use loadlin from FreeDos to somehow kickstart the install?
2006-12-03T17:17:00.000Z	carlfk	MannyL	maybe.  I just discovered kexec, which loads and runs kernels from a booted linux
2006-12-03T17:19:00.000Z	carlfk	MannyL	which lets me wget the netboot kernel/initrd and run it, which starts the installer (it just takes over the system)
2006-12-03T17:19:00.000Z	carlfk	MannyL	give me a sec... I'll dig up the URL's I used.  worth a shot
2006-12-03T17:19:00.000Z	MannyL	carlfk	kexec sounds great to me but I need something that runs under 2003 or Dos
2006-12-03T17:20:00.000Z	carlfk	MannyL	you mentioned loadlin... may be the same thing as kexec
2006-12-03T17:21:00.000Z	carlfk	MannyL	find me a URL describing loadlin - I am interested.  pm it to me if you can - I am switching to another box for a min or 2

2006-12-03T17:31:00.000Z	carlfk	MannyL	check out the bottem of that page - I just added the wget commands for where you can get the installer.  see if that works with loadlin
