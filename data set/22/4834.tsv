2007-11-16T11:35:00.000Z	levander		I keep having to delete and recreate my Keyword Search in Firefox for the Ubuntu Forums.  Does that happen to everyone who's doing that?
2007-11-16T11:36:00.000Z	bazhang	levander	sounds like an issue for Mozilla channel
2007-12-14T19:51:00.000Z	bazhang	levander	using compiz?
2007-12-14T19:52:00.000Z	bazhang	levander	I had that same problem with many apps, til I shut off compiz
2008-01-22T11:41:00.000Z	levander	bazhang	Thanks, but that thread just says to use procmail in some specific case.
2008-01-22T11:46:00.000Z	bazhang	levander	 the only other (non-bug) link I found was asking users to learn mutt :{
2008-03-30T03:51:00.000Z	bazhang	levander	best ask that in #compiz-fusion
2008-03-30T04:10:00.000Z	bazhang	levander	he was totally new to ubuntu
2008-03-30T04:11:00.000Z	levander	bazhang	So, what makes it more difficult to install 64 bit for newbies?
2008-03-30T04:11:00.000Z	bazhang	levander	flash for one
2008-03-30T04:12:00.000Z	levander	bazhang	I thought that firefox plugin wrapper on 64 bit was supposed to work fine with flash?
2008-03-30T04:14:00.000Z	bazhang	levander	any commands ;]
2008-03-30T04:14:00.000Z	levander	bazhang	Like, there's no "Software Sources" dialog in 64 bits, so you have to use apt-get on the command line?
2008-03-30T04:15:00.000Z	bazhang	levander	this is getting a bit offtopic..
2008-03-30T04:16:00.000Z	bazhang	levander	actually folks here do know but this is not the 32/64 bit chat channel ;]
2008-03-30T04:17:00.000Z	levander	bazhang	Jack_Sparrow: You guys need to read the channel topic.
2008-03-30T04:17:00.000Z	bazhang	levander	haha
2008-08-20T10:44:00.000Z	bazhang	levander	you have to get it from their site
2008-08-20T10:46:00.000Z	levander	bazhang	Any idea why it's not in the repositories?  Like at least medibuntu?
2008-08-20T10:46:00.000Z	bazhang	levander	dont know why
2008-08-20T10:46:00.000Z	levander	bazhang	Thanks.
