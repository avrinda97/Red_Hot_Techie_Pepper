2008-09-11T05:06:00.000Z	grobda24	slashjamiec	why does this page https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/installation-guide/i386/hardware-supported.html say 486 is supported ? Confused :/
2008-09-11T05:07:00.000Z	slashjamiec	grobda24	I didn't say it wasn't, I said it would be a pain trying to run Ubuntu on a 486 and I personally wouldn't, but it's up to you to take the plunge and try and run a GUI on a 233mhz
2008-09-11T05:07:00.000Z	grobda24	slashjamiec	so it does it really take days to load ?
2008-09-11T05:08:00.000Z	slashjamiec	grobda24	Not days per-se, but some time, yes.
2008-09-11T05:09:00.000Z	slashjamiec	grobda24	I tried booting ubuntu off a livecd on a 533mhz PC, it took around 30 minutes to get to the desktop.
2008-09-11T05:09:00.000Z	grobda24	slashjamiec	hmmm, I'm not sure I agree with your approach, if they were running win98 on it. gnome with all the extras turned off should be ok. But no matter.
2008-09-11T05:09:00.000Z	grobda24	slashjamiec	30 mins is not days !
2008-09-11T05:10:00.000Z	slashjamiec	grobda24	Well, you try using gnome on a 233mhz PC :P
2008-09-11T05:10:00.000Z	grobda24	slashjamiec	yeah your recommended distros may be faster of course.
2008-09-11T05:10:00.000Z	grobda24	slashjamiec	I might have to but an old 486 just to try this :P
2008-09-11T05:12:00.000Z	slashjamiec	grobda24	Lol, you'll need to read the requirements on running a LiveCD of ubuntu on the ubuntu website. You need 256MB of ram I'd imagine.
2008-09-11T05:13:00.000Z	grobda24	slashjamiec	seems important seeing that Ubuntu is aimed at low resource users ?
2008-09-11T05:13:00.000Z	slashjamiec	grobda24	Not as low as a 486 for livecd, unfortunately. Maybe if you installed it instead of livecd and then went to fluxbox, then everything would work seamlessly.
2008-09-11T05:14:00.000Z	slashjamiec	grobda24	Fluxbox is a lightweight window manager, sorry
2008-09-11T05:15:00.000Z	grobda24	slashjamiec	who mentioned any livecd's ? I see your point though.
2008-09-11T05:15:00.000Z	slashjamiec	grobda24	I'm assuming since you're a new user you'd automatically use the livecd. Sorry.
2008-09-11T05:16:00.000Z	grobda24	slashjamiec	s'ok.
2008-09-11T05:16:00.000Z	slashjamiec	grobda24	ok
2008-09-11T05:20:00.000Z	grobda24	slashjamiec	I read something about Ubuntu for developing countries somewhere.
2008-09-11T05:22:00.000Z	slashjamiec	grobda24	Ubuntu develops everywhere. The name derives from an african word.
2008-09-11T05:23:00.000Z	grobda24	slashjamiec	well, anyway, we're down to semantics really. I can't find where I read about Ubuntu (the distro) in developing countries now. Interesting discussion. Laters.
2008-09-11T05:24:00.000Z	slashjamiec	grobda24	Right. I'm here for Ubuntu Support, not about story telling philosophy's, sorry
