2006-09-12T14:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CVirus	yes, that sometimes works
2006-09-12T14:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CVirus	you don't - you use  sudo dpkg -i /path/to/nameofdeb
2006-09-12T14:12:00.000Z	CVirus	thoreauputic	deps ?
2006-09-12T14:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CVirus	although in Dapper you can now just click on it and gdebi will run
2006-09-12T14:12:00.000Z	CVirus	thoreauputic	Kubuntu here
2006-09-12T14:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CVirus	what is this package?
2006-09-12T14:13:00.000Z	CVirus	thoreauputic	democracyplayer
2006-09-12T14:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CVirus	should install OK with dpkg I think
2006-09-12T14:13:00.000Z	CVirus	thoreauputic	will you tell me how to resolve deps for a local package ?
2006-09-12T14:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CVirus	if not the deps are fairly straightforward
2006-09-12T14:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CVirus	dpkg will tell you what is missing
2006-09-12T14:14:00.000Z	CVirus	thoreauputic	I know it will .. I dont want to resolve them manually
2006-09-12T14:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CVirus	well, democracyplayer is outside the repos - surely the web page tells you what it depends on?
2006-09-12T14:15:00.000Z	CVirus	thoreauputic	that doesnt answer my question
2006-09-12T14:15:00.000Z	CVirus	thoreauputic	how can I resolve the deps automaticaly for a local package
2006-09-12T14:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CVirus	it isn't magic - you can't wave a wand and have apt do stuff it isn't designed to do
2006-09-12T14:16:00.000Z	CVirus	thoreauputic	now that answers my question :-)
2006-09-12T14:20:00.000Z	CVirus	thoreauputic	to do what I wanted to do I had to put the .deb in /var/cache/apt/archives and then apt-get install it
2006-09-12T14:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CVirus	but not necessarily :)
2006-09-12T14:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CVirus	apt still needs to know where the deps are so if one of them isn't in the repos you are out of luck
2006-09-12T14:23:00.000Z	CVirus	thoreauputic	exactly
2006-09-12T14:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CVirus	no
