2006-12-30T10:09:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	provide me with a link to this forum you're talking about...
2006-12-30T10:12:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	huh? how about just clensing your cookies n stuff and try again?
2006-12-30T10:13:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	well, if you can't reach the site, can you reach other sites?
2006-12-30T10:17:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	and you can do a traceroute all the way?
2006-12-30T10:22:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	how do you connect not being able to reach a site into offended someone?
2006-12-30T10:23:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	if you can't reach the server, how would anyone ban you from the forum-part?
2006-12-30T10:23:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	you've got a glitch somewhere - try to reboot.
2006-12-30T10:25:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	try a different browser then
2006-12-30T10:25:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	and do a copy&paste on http://82.211.81.186/index.php?s=8cffc1decb516bb4baaace7d9ce877c0
2006-12-30T10:29:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	there's no way I can find your post with just the info gnome.
2006-12-30T10:31:00.000Z	ezman	ewook	Did you find it ???
2006-12-30T10:31:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	in what part? new to ubuntu,  main support, other support?
2006-12-30T10:33:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	what username did you post it with?
2006-12-30T10:35:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	now, since I've proven that it's still there - would you mind getting to work on acctually reaching the post yourself? =)
2006-12-30T10:37:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	and another thing, I don't use gnome nor kde ;)
2006-12-30T10:47:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	that nice.
2006-12-30T10:53:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	I can't really say that there's anything wrong with the site.
2006-12-30T10:53:00.000Z	ewook	ezman	so my tip is that you get yourself in ;)
