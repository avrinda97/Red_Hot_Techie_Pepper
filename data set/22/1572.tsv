2010-06-04T07:25:00.000Z	kzman		do you know how to reset the panel icons position ?
2010-06-04T07:26:00.000Z	edbian	kzman	Do you know about the hidden folders in your /home/userName  folder?
2010-06-04T07:27:00.000Z	kzman	edbian	what?
2010-06-04T07:27:00.000Z	edbian	kzman	Go there in nautilus and choose view -> show hidden files
2010-06-04T07:27:00.000Z	edbian	kzman	Any folder / file that starts with a "." will be hidden.
2010-06-04T07:28:00.000Z	kzman	edbian	And for what I should do that?
2010-06-04T07:28:00.000Z	edbian	kzman	All of those hidden files in your /home store your settings for all of your apps.  The gnome-panel is one of your apps.  If you delete one of those . folders then the settings for that app are erased and the next time the app starts the defaults are put there.
2010-06-04T07:29:00.000Z	edbian	kzman	So figure out (using google) where the gnome-panel folder is (probably some where under .gnome2) and delete it!
2010-06-04T07:29:00.000Z	edbian	kzman	Than re-start your gnome-panels
2010-06-04T07:30:00.000Z	kzman	edbian	ok i understood that now
2010-06-04T07:31:00.000Z	edbian	kzman	Awesome.  Good luck!
2010-06-04T07:31:00.000Z	kzman	edbian	and reboot, or logout?
2010-06-04T07:31:00.000Z	edbian	kzman	That would do it
2010-06-04T07:34:00.000Z	kzman	edbian	i dont have .gnome-panel and I lookedthe .gnome2/panel2.d and it's empty
2010-06-04T07:37:00.000Z	edbian	kzman	I'm looking for it too right now.
2010-06-04T07:38:00.000Z	edbian	kzman	Remove ~/.gconf/apps/panel  (the whole dir
2010-06-04T07:39:00.000Z	kzman	edbian	is it a secure deletion?
2010-06-04T07:39:00.000Z	edbian	kzman	What do you mean secure?
2010-06-04T07:41:00.000Z	kzman	edbian	I mean, if this deletion won't spoil gnome
2010-06-04T07:41:00.000Z	edbian	kzman	No, it will not ruin anything.
2010-06-04T07:41:00.000Z	edbian	kzman	It will make the gnome-panel have all the settings the same it did when you originially installed ubuntu
2011-06-02T06:20:00.000Z	edbian	kzman	I don't know what icon you're talking about but to get your borders back run compiz --replace&
