2008-03-29T09:43:00.000Z	cocox	Dr_willis	here it is =) thanks http://pastebin.com/m12f09c2e
2008-03-29T09:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis		I have to wonder.. if it wasent real.. wouldit also not be legal?
2008-03-29T09:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocox	 windows may not like   /dev/sda7           15634       19457    30716248+   7  HPFS/NTFS, since its a logical partition.  you have one of the most complex drive layouts ive seen in a LONG time..
2008-03-29T09:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocox	 whate version of windows you installing?
2008-03-29T09:46:00.000Z	cocox	Dr_willis	im trying to install XP.... befeore seveal times i ve installed XP on a logical partition
2008-03-29T09:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocox	 i always just put them in primaries. The drive layout may be the issue.   You could try formating tha paittion to ntfs.
2008-03-29T09:47:00.000Z	cocox	Dr_willis	is in NTFS isn't?
2008-03-29T09:48:00.000Z	cocox	Dr_willis	do you think there is any problem if that partition is too far away?
2008-03-29T09:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocox	 is it formated to ntfs?
2008-03-29T09:48:00.000Z	cocox	Dr_willis	i mean it is supoused to be near to de 1024 MB to be recognized??
2008-03-29T09:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocox	 hard to tell. I always have the habbit of putting windows on the first primary partition - to be super-safe
2008-03-29T09:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocox	 the 1024 limit - is not an issue i thought.. but heck it may still be.
2008-03-29T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocox	 actaually it was a 1024 cylinder limit i recall.. not 1024mb. :)
2008-03-29T09:49:00.000Z	cocox	Dr_willis	i think is an issue in older drives
2008-03-29T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocox	 thats possible.
2008-03-29T09:49:00.000Z	cocox	Dr_willis	yeah lol cant remember!
2008-03-29T09:49:00.000Z	cocox	Dr_willis	right im gonna try with a primary partition
2008-03-29T09:49:00.000Z	cocox	Dr_willis	thank you =)
