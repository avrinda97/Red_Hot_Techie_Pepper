2005-02-21T13:54:00.000Z	mpq		I have a problem
2005-02-21T13:54:00.000Z	mpq		I can't figure out how to install wine
2005-02-21T13:54:00.000Z	mpq		the directions on the wine website aren't helping
2005-02-21T13:54:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	apt-get install wine?
2005-02-21T13:55:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	you need to use sudo to modify anything outside of /home/username/
2005-02-21T13:57:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	What do you need wine for?
2005-02-21T13:58:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	you can also do gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-02-21T14:09:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	Yeah, I have no idea how they got it to install...
2005-02-21T14:14:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	If you want to see a cool music player check out quodlibet http://kai.vm.bytemark.co.uk/~piman/software/quodlibet.shtml
2005-02-21T14:24:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	But there are many interesting music players for linux.
2005-02-21T14:24:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	Lsongs?
2005-02-21T14:27:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	Do you have Bounce Connected?
2005-02-21T14:27:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	The problem with unicode mp3s is that it's worng.
2005-02-21T14:33:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	Grip is all you'll need for ripping cds
2005-02-21T14:35:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	http://www.musicbrainz.org/
2005-02-21T14:41:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	what are you compiling?
2005-02-21T14:41:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	this isn't gentoo
2005-02-21T14:43:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	compiling is ./configure && make
2005-02-21T14:43:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	But grip is already in the Ubuntu APT repository.
2005-02-21T14:44:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	Grip has a pretty terrible GUI, but it's the most configurable program.
2005-02-21T14:46:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	replace your /etc/apt/sources.list with mine http://wm-eddie.info/~wm_eddie/sources.list
2005-02-21T16:06:00.000Z	wm_eddie	mpq	you know QL has a function that can split a tag into two different tags.
