2008-04-01T05:37:00.000Z	saikor	sk8ball	I wouldn't recommend it.
2008-04-01T05:37:00.000Z	sk8ball	saikor	why is that?
2008-04-01T05:37:00.000Z	saikor	sk8ball	there is no way to tell if a disk has had the buffer flushed. So you could cause corruption
2008-04-01T05:37:00.000Z	sk8ball	saikor	what if its a dvdrw
2008-04-01T05:38:00.000Z	saikor	sk8ball	hrm...dunno.
2008-04-01T05:38:00.000Z	saikor	sk8ball	you could give it a go and let us know, but if you break something don't blame me.
2008-04-01T06:35:00.000Z	sk8ball	saikor	how do i do it... i dont have correct permissions
2008-04-01T06:35:00.000Z	saikor	sk8ball	^

2008-04-01T06:41:00.000Z	saikor	sk8ball	ohhh
2008-04-01T06:42:00.000Z	saikor	sk8ball	look in the /etc/X11 folder, there should be a backup in there
2008-04-01T06:42:00.000Z	sk8ball	saikor	thats what i thought xorg.conf.1
2008-04-01T06:43:00.000Z	saikor	sk8ball	cp the backup to /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-04-01T06:43:00.000Z	sk8ball	saikor	i cp'd the xorg.conf.1 to it, i figured this was it as there was like 3 of em, and i thought the other ones were my other attempts at fixing it
2008-04-01T06:44:00.000Z	saikor	sk8ball	log out then back in? did that work?
2008-04-01T07:22:00.000Z	sk8ball	saikor	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg was the answer to my problems
2008-04-01T07:23:00.000Z	saikor	sk8ball	ah, glad you got it running.
2008-04-01T07:23:00.000Z	sk8ball	saikor	thx for the help
2008-04-01T07:23:00.000Z	saikor	sk8ball	yeah that makes sense. I always forget you can do that.
