2008-04-11T01:27:00.000Z	Totem		I compiled a simple program in c++. Why can't I double click on it to run it? I don't want to have to open the terminal every time to run my programs.
2008-04-11T01:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Totem	if it is a terminal program you will have to do just that...
2008-04-11T01:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	Totem	keep the terminal open ;)
2008-04-11T01:28:00.000Z	Totem	erUSUL	oh, so if my program uses the cout stream, I will have to use the terminal no matter what?
2008-04-11T01:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	Totem	yep
2008-04-11T01:29:00.000Z	Totem	erUSUL	well, thanks
2008-04-11T01:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Totem	you can make a launcher that just do "gnome-terminal -e path/to/your/program"
2008-04-11T01:30:00.000Z	Totem	erUSUL	so the program would run if it didn't use the terminal?
2008-04-11T01:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Totem	assing it an icon and be done with it
2008-04-11T01:30:00.000Z	Totem	erUSUL	can I just double click on the launcher to run it?
2008-04-11T01:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	Totem	yep
2008-04-11T01:31:00.000Z	Totem	erUSUL	ok, thanks
2008-04-11T01:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	Totem	if you set up this way yes
2008-04-11T01:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Totem	you have to use some kind of widget lib gtk, qt, wxwindows, fltk, etc
2008-04-11T01:34:00.000Z	Totem	erUSUL	darn... how about if I use opengl; do I have to use one?
2008-04-11T01:35:00.000Z	Totem	erUSUL	nvm
2008-04-11T01:35:00.000Z	Totem	erUSUL	thanks
2008-04-11T01:35:00.000Z	Totem	erUSUL	do you happen to know what Firefox uses?
2008-04-11T01:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	Totem	it uses its own framework plus gtk and other low level libs like cairo and pango
2008-04-11T01:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Totem	just follow thwe instructions on the page ubotu told you
2008-04-17T22:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	Totem	mv folder destination/
2008-04-17T22:07:00.000Z	Totem	erUSUL	thanks
