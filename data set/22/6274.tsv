2009-06-18T15:33:00.000Z	oenone1		good evening
2009-06-18T15:33:00.000Z	oenone1		how do I install americas army in ubuntu ?
2009-06-18T15:34:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	have you downloaded it?
2009-06-18T15:36:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	I think it's the same in any linux variant.. you download the file.. run it.. it installs.. you run the game
2009-06-18T15:36:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	if it still has a linux client.. not sure about that
2009-06-18T15:37:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	if you can install it my guess is you will be able to play online
2009-06-18T15:38:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	yes, it's free
2009-06-18T15:39:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	hmm.. seems they discontinued the linux/mac version =/
2009-06-18T15:40:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	you can try wine.. see if it's listed in the application database
2009-06-18T15:42:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	I thought so too.. afaik it was a game for linux.. but they stopped releasing updates for the linux version..to bad
2009-06-20T14:58:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	not sure you can.. don't they require javascript and such?
2009-06-20T14:59:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	firefox? or you're on a command line?
2009-06-20T15:00:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	then firefox would be the easiest I guess
2009-06-20T15:01:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	not sure there is one.. not with the same functionality
2009-06-20T15:01:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	there is gwget.. but search in synaptic for download manager.. see what you find
2009-06-21T12:28:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	it didn't come with instructions? what kind of file do you have?
2009-06-21T12:29:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	chmod a+x yourawesomefile.bin    then    ./yourawesomefile.bin    should do it
2009-06-21T12:29:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	yes
2009-06-21T12:29:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	you're welcome
2009-06-21T12:31:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	nope, or.. there is one guy supporting it.. in his spare time or something like that
2009-06-21T12:33:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	gnome
2009-06-21T12:36:00.000Z	Slart	oenone1	no idea.. you didn't get a shortcut in any of the menus?
