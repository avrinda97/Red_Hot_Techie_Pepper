2006-08-19T09:37:00.000Z	scott_		Would someone like to help me out with a sound problem? i think i am just missing a group and need help to find out the default groups i need
2006-08-19T09:39:00.000Z	scott_		could someone just run "groups" for their main user and tell me what they have??
2006-08-19T09:41:00.000Z	scott_		how are you suppose to add groups to your user name correctly?
2006-08-19T09:41:00.000Z	jrib	scott_	addgroup
2006-08-19T09:41:00.000Z	scott_	jrib	as root right?
2006-08-19T09:42:00.000Z	jrib	scott_	yeah
2006-11-10T12:30:00.000Z	jrib	scott_	you should have maple10/bin/maple  (or at least this is how maple 9.5 does it)
2006-11-10T12:32:00.000Z	jrib	scott_	you can double click on that, or run it in a terminal
2006-11-10T12:34:00.000Z	jrib	scott_	ok, type '/home/scott/maple10/bin/maple' in a terminal and tell me the output
2006-11-10T12:36:00.000Z	jrib	scott_	if it is long, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-11-10T12:37:00.000Z	jrib	scott_	oh right, you want xmaple, not maple :)
2006-11-10T12:37:00.000Z	jrib	scott_	you may have some maple's running in the background now that you can't see... feel free to kill them
2006-11-10T12:40:00.000Z	jrib	scott_	don't you have it in that same folder?
2006-11-10T12:41:00.000Z	jrib	scott_	np, you can create a launcher for it in your menu now
2006-11-10T12:43:00.000Z	jrib	scott_	right click on the ubuntu icon by your menu and hit "edit menu", then add a new item and the command to run is '/home/scott/maple10/bin/xmaple'
2008-11-10T05:15:00.000Z	jrib	scott_	use hardy
2008-11-10T05:16:00.000Z	scott_	jrib	ok how can i completely downgrade after i've already upgraded to ibex?
2008-11-10T05:16:00.000Z	jrib	scott_	reinstall
2008-11-10T05:17:00.000Z	scott_	jrib	you mean like from a cd?
2008-11-10T05:17:00.000Z	jrib	scott_	yes.  Downgrading is not supported, so you need to reinstall if you want to use hardy
2008-11-10T05:19:00.000Z	scott_	jrib	IndyGunFreak: am i correct in thinking that the only way to get compiz working in ibex with an ati card is to...not use ibex, but downgrade to hardy?
2008-11-10T05:20:00.000Z	jrib	scott_	don't know, don't use ati
