2006-04-12T12:25:00.000Z	newbuntu		ive gotten good help before
2006-04-12T12:27:00.000Z	newbuntu		is there a way to config your alsa setup? I have alsa installed but I get no sound, kmix volumes are up, and the plug is in the right hole...
2006-04-12T12:28:00.000Z	newbuntu		just the onboard via
2006-04-12T12:30:00.000Z	newbuntu		sometimes it works on a reboot , sometimes not
2006-04-12T12:30:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbuntu	Intangir you should be able to disable on board sound in the bios
2006-04-12T13:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbuntu	you need to add an entry to /etc/modules & pass the io & irq as module parameters - suggest a quick google should sort it out
2006-04-12T13:06:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbuntu	if it's a motherboard sound card, it's not isa - it should show up with 'sudo lsmod'
2006-04-12T13:07:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbuntu	soz, 'sudo lspci'
2006-04-12T13:09:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbuntu	usually the kernel takes care of it completely
2006-04-12T13:12:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbuntu	you might see something like (if it's and AC97): Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp. 82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 03)
2006-04-12T13:13:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbuntu	yup
2006-04-12T13:13:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbuntu	we have a winner
2006-04-12T13:14:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbuntu	you may just need to change: sys -> prefs -> multimedia selector -> output (try either OSS or alsa), input = alsa
2006-04-12T13:17:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbuntu	from the toolbar
2006-04-12T13:17:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbuntu	system -> preferences -> multimedia selector
2006-04-12T13:18:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbuntu	yes, but I don't use kde, so I don't know
2006-04-12T13:18:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbuntu	someone will fix you up, I'm on my way out, so good luck
2006-07-08T13:54:00.000Z	Frogzoo	newbuntu	linus torvalds is entitled to his opinion
