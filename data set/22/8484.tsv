2005-07-31T15:12:00.000Z	erigato		is more swap space more effective than adding RAM?
2005-07-31T15:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	erigato	no
2005-07-31T15:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	erigato	RAM is an order of magnitude faster
2005-07-31T15:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	erigato	no
2005-07-31T15:14:00.000Z	erigato	thoreauputic	an=one order? bob says thousand times
2005-07-31T15:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	erigato	yeah, bob2 is right :)
2005-07-31T15:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	erigato	if you have a reasonable mount of RAM (say 512 or so ) you won't be swapping much anyway
2005-07-31T15:18:00.000Z	erigato	thoreauputic	ok i got 512 getting another 512 to add. but i wonder if it is worth putting the os on the faster hard drive
2005-07-31T15:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	erigato	depends how much faster the new drive is I suppose
2005-07-31T15:21:00.000Z	erigato	thoreauputic	5400rpm on the WD protege as compared to 7200rpm on the seagate barracuda
2005-07-31T15:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	erigato	well, it's up to you really - I don't think I would bother personally, but it depends how important the last bit of speed is to you (with 1gig of RAM it should be pretty snappy anyway)
2005-07-31T16:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	erigato	 partimage, from memory
2005-07-31T16:26:00.000Z	erigato	thoreauputic	what do you mean from memory
2005-07-31T16:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	erigato	just that: but check "apt-cache show partimage"
2005-07-31T16:28:00.000Z	erigato	thoreauputic	cool, sounds good. is it hard to use. have you tried it
2005-07-31T16:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	erigato	I just remembered it did something like what you describe
2005-07-31T16:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	erigato	no, I haven't tried it myself
2005-07-31T16:29:00.000Z	erigato	thoreauputic	i wanna move my ubuntu on a new drive
2005-07-31T16:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	erigato	I gathered ;)
2005-07-31T16:30:00.000Z	erigato	thoreauputic	huh? gathered?
2005-07-31T16:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	erigato	dict gathered: >> To derive, or deduce, as an inference; <snip>
2005-07-31T16:33:00.000Z	erigato	thoreauputic	oh yeah
