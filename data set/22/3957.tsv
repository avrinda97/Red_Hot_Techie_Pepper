2008-05-21T11:32:00.000Z	cypha		which i really really miss from winamp
2008-05-21T11:33:00.000Z	cypha		can someone tell me how to use the git-core?
2008-05-21T11:33:00.000Z	cypha		i'd like to know what files change after installations and options
2008-05-21T11:34:00.000Z	cypha		that way i can learn to manipulate config files manually, without the need for someone to have made a GUI
2008-05-21T11:34:00.000Z	cypha		i so far did sudo apt-get install git-core
2008-05-21T11:35:00.000Z	cypha		git init .
2008-05-21T11:35:00.000Z	cypha		git diff
2008-05-21T11:37:00.000Z	cypha		i thought that's what it did
2008-05-21T11:38:00.000Z	cypha		if i learn to manually edit the config files, i'll be able to pretty much control linux the way i'd like, no?
2008-05-21T11:40:00.000Z	cypha		what's CVS stand for?

2008-05-26T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	cypha	You're right, but you'll catch them the next time around.  Anyone who is awake will read it when it happens, you don't have to worry about awake people missing it
2008-06-01T13:18:00.000Z	Flannel	cypha	they're from indonesia, and have already been told.
2009-06-12T08:50:00.000Z	Flannel	cypha	Right.  This channel is not for them, but #ubuntu-bots has such a feature.
