2012-11-13T01:48:00.000Z	GregMathis		I just installed 12.04, how do i move the panel to the bottom and put the hide buttons on the side?
2012-11-13T01:49:00.000Z	thelinux	GregMathis	You can't, atleast for now.
2012-11-13T01:49:00.000Z	GregMathis	thelinux	please tell me thats a joke
2012-11-13T01:50:00.000Z	GregMathis	thelinux	which version was the last to let you do that?  I'm happy i found this out right after installing
2012-11-13T01:50:00.000Z	thelinux	GregMathis	Nope, reason is I guess because it would ruin the look and feel of Unity.
2012-11-13T01:51:00.000Z	GregMathis	thelinux	so how far back to i need to go to be able to get the customizeable version?
2012-11-13T01:52:00.000Z	thelinux	GregMathis	I don't think Unity can be customized like that, not even previous versions, maybe some hacks, but something nice and clean no.
2012-11-13T01:53:00.000Z	GregMathis	thelinux	there is a way, i had 10.something and you could customize it
2012-11-13T01:53:00.000Z	GregMathis	thelinux	pretty cool too, you could move the panels all to the bottom, hide them heck you could even make your own panels -yoiu would have liked it
2012-11-13T01:53:00.000Z	thelinux	GregMathis	10.04 LTS and 10.10 have Gnome 2.x as DE, Later versions use Unity.
2012-11-13T01:54:00.000Z	GregMathis	thelinux	i dunno i just download ubuntu not familiar with unity...
2012-11-13T01:54:00.000Z	thelinux	GregMathis	And Gnome 2.x is dead project now, but there exists now MATE which is fork of Gnome 2.x
2012-11-13T01:54:00.000Z	GregMathis	thelinux	so 10.10 is the last one to use the whatever it is tghat allows you to customize the panel?
2012-11-13T01:55:00.000Z	thelinux	GregMathis	10.10 is no longer supported.
2012-11-13T01:56:00.000Z	thelinux	GregMathis	If you really like Gnome 2.x use Ubuntu 10.04 LTS which will be supported until 2013 April. But you can install XFCE on Ubuntu 12.04 which is similiar to Gnome 2.x
2012-11-13T01:58:00.000Z	GregMathis	thelinux	thanks i think thats what im gonna do
2012-11-13T01:59:00.000Z	thelinux	GregMathis	Why don't you first try XFCE on Ubuntu 12.04, it's similiar to Gnome 2.x
2012-11-13T01:59:00.000Z	GregMathis	thelinux	before i go if i install it from a netbook is there anyway to force it not to do the netbook remix?
2012-11-13T01:59:00.000Z	GregMathis	thelinux	i have tried xfce on older ones i cant see it being better than gnome
2012-11-13T02:00:00.000Z	thelinux	GregMathis	Try MATE.
2012-11-13T02:01:00.000Z	thelinux	GregMathis	Try MATE, you can install it right there on 12.04. It's fork of GNOME 2.X
2012-11-13T02:04:00.000Z	thelinux	GregMathis	Try Cinnamon like they suggested, it's great and customizable.
