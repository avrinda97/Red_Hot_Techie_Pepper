2010-11-23T21:55:00.000Z	gmitrev		hey guys
2010-11-23T21:56:00.000Z	gmitrev		i've just installed ubuntu on my friend's laptop
2010-11-23T21:56:00.000Z	gmitrev		and lamp as well
2010-11-23T21:56:00.000Z	gmitrev		but when i copy out php project in the localhost dir
2010-11-23T21:56:00.000Z	gmitrev		it's not even shown in 127.0.0.1
2010-11-23T21:56:00.000Z	gmitrev		i tried sudo chmod 777 -R folder
2010-11-23T21:57:00.000Z	gmitrev		but it's still broken
2010-11-23T21:58:00.000Z	Visuex	gmitrev	a lamp channel would probably help you the best... but in the future there is no need to split up what you are saying into that many lines...just put it all on one like this as it will be able to hold as much as you need it to
2010-11-23T21:59:00.000Z	gmitrev	Visuex	my bad, sorry
2010-11-23T22:00:00.000Z	Visuex	gmitrev	no worries but the chmod shouldnt affect what you are doing as even 644 will be viewable
2010-11-23T22:04:00.000Z	gmitrev	Visuex	i think the problem is in the permissions. when i make a new folder in localhost folder, it's accessible through both http://localhost and 127.0.0.1. But when i copy the folder from my computer and try to open it, i get Internal Server Error page
2010-11-23T22:05:00.000Z	Visuex	gmitrev	so if you make something in the folder it works but if you make it outside and try to move it in there it doesnt work?
2010-11-23T22:06:00.000Z	gmitrev	Visuex	no, if i copy it from another computer or usb device
2010-11-23T22:07:00.000Z	gmitrev	Visuex	the problem is present only when the folder comes from another computer or device
2010-11-23T22:08:00.000Z	Visuex	gmitrev	try to take whatever is in usb move it to your comp without being in localhost and then to localhost from your comp...I know seems like a pointless extra step but might solve it
2010-11-23T22:11:00.000Z	Visuex	gmitrev	did that work?
2010-11-23T22:12:00.000Z	gmitrev	Visuex	no, i'm trying to think of something else. it just doesn't make any sence
2010-11-23T22:14:00.000Z	Visuex	gmitrev	indeed that does not...other than the fact that your USB is probably formatted to FAT32 which may change the permissions when a file is added to it
2010-11-23T22:15:00.000Z	Visuex	gmitrev	the other computer is it running ubuntu as well
2010-11-23T22:16:00.000Z	gmitrev	Visuex	we've tried ftp, skype transfer, usb transfer and everytime we get the same error. both PCs are running ubuntu
2010-11-23T22:20:00.000Z	Visuex	gmitrev	it may depend on the type of file but I have an idea which probably isnt the most elegant but could work... archive the files into a zip or whatever you like such as a tar and then transfer it anyway you want...then if it changes the permissions of the zip it shouldnt affect the contents of the archive
2010-11-23T22:25:00.000Z	Visuex	gmitrev	hopefully that answers your question as I have to log off now but if it doesnt just send me a private message and I'll try to help when I get back...ciao
