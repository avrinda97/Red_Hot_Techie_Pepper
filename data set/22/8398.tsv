2005-11-02T16:52:00.000Z	barongas		Will updating to breezy affect any of my config files?
2005-11-02T16:54:00.000Z	signius	barongas	unless you got a real good reason to upgrade i would check out some of the prgrams and stuff you use first as i have had loads of hassle with stuff since upgrading and would advice IMHO to hold fire upgrading just for the sake of upgrading isnt always a wise move
2005-11-02T16:55:00.000Z	signius		Well i gave my 2 pennies worth of adive all the same so he lost his right to come to me crying if it goes tits up now :-p
2005-11-02T16:57:00.000Z	signius		Yeah some of the window managers other than kde/gnome are real nice once you get used to them
2005-11-02T16:57:00.000Z	signius		you realise how much bloat and stuff you dont need is in kde and gnome
2005-11-02T16:57:00.000Z	signius		Athough i do think KDE is much much more guilty of this
2005-11-02T16:58:00.000Z	signius		and while KDE looks prettier it just has too many ways of doing stuff and doesnt seemt o have any real goals or solid direction IMHO
2005-11-02T16:58:00.000Z	barongas		So should I reboot my machine/x-windows or something when my dist-upgrade is finished?
2005-11-02T16:59:00.000Z	signius		gnome is much more business like and is working toward solid reliable and more simplistic in how things are achieved if soemthing can be done 1 way and that way works and is efficient why do you need to re-invent the wheel another 20 times just because you can and in the prcess introduce a whole raft of other ways for things to break and get messed up ?
2005-11-02T16:59:00.000Z	barongas		aight...
2005-11-02T17:00:00.000Z	signius		But maybe i preaching to the already converted
2005-11-02T17:01:00.000Z	signius		Actually in all fairness the layout of windows and the UI isnt bad at all and because of the money MS have available to them they can invest heavly in research into this area Apple is in the same position and apple do do some really intuitive and nice GUIs
2005-11-02T17:02:00.000Z	signius		It is a very very difficult thing to achive between getting simplistic but not taking away more advanced users needs also
2005-11-02T17:03:00.000Z	barongas	signius	Well the opensource community also have quite a bunch of inituitive projects going down. Check out www.symphonyos.com for example
2005-11-02T17:03:00.000Z	signius		Eric Raymend wrote a good paper about this and how bad OS developers are at meeting the needs of every day users and designing a system before thinking of a UI
2005-11-02T17:04:00.000Z	barongas	signius	That goes for almost all software developers. People who don't think who they are making the programs for
2005-11-02T17:05:00.000Z	signius		yes exactly before a prgrammer just stats coding he should sit down with a pen and paper and think about what it is the users are going to be doing and how they will want to use it
2005-11-02T17:05:00.000Z	signius		however this is seldom the case
2005-11-02T17:05:00.000Z	signius		or she
2005-11-02T17:05:00.000Z	barongas		And often work with testers even before he/she writes a single line of code.
2005-11-02T17:06:00.000Z	signius	barongas	that is exactly what i was referring to with MS and Apple having the resources to do this available to them
2005-11-02T17:07:00.000Z	barongas	signius	Indeed... there really should be somewhere for designers/testers/coders to meet...
