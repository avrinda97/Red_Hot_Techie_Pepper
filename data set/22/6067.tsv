2006-12-27T17:29:00.000Z	bandit	alex-weej	INTEL ICH5
2006-12-27T17:29:00.000Z	alex-weej	bandit	what happens when you run "gst-launch-0.10 audiotestsrc ! gconfaudiosink"? (press ctrl+c to quit it)
2006-12-27T17:30:00.000Z	bandit	alex-weej	it looks like its play but I can't hear anything
2006-12-27T17:31:00.000Z	alex-weej	bandit	ok try this
2006-12-27T17:31:00.000Z	alex-weej	bandit	"audiotestsrc ! alsasink"
2006-12-27T17:31:00.000Z	alex-weej	bandit	with gst-launch-0.10 in front of it, sorry
2006-12-27T17:32:00.000Z	bandit	alex-weej	still nothing
2006-12-27T17:32:00.000Z	alex-weej	bandit	run "alsamixer" (it's a console-based mixing application)
2006-12-27T17:33:00.000Z	alex-weej	bandit	and have a play around, sometimes some of the settings there may be hidden from other mixers by default
2006-12-27T17:34:00.000Z	alex-weej	bandit	sorry i can't really help more than that but it really does seem like it's a mixing problem
2006-12-27T17:57:00.000Z	bandit	alex-weej	it was indeed a mixing problem, somehow my 'PCM' channel got muted, i feel like an idiot
2006-12-27T17:58:00.000Z	alex-weej	bandit	haha unlucky mate
2006-12-27T17:58:00.000Z	alex-weej	bandit	well at least it's working now :)
2006-12-27T17:59:00.000Z	alex-weej	bandit	if you want to enable more controls in GNOME Volume Control, you can do so in its "Preferences" panel
