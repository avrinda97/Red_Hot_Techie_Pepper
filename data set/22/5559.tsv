2011-03-14T04:52:00.000Z	sabgenton	jrib	ok but how do I see if a programs been update-rc.d ed?
2011-03-14T04:53:00.000Z	jrib	sabgenton	what do you want to accomplish exactly?  Most init scripts have been migrated over to upstart
2011-03-14T04:55:00.000Z	sabgenton	jrib	if I had to go out of my way to do update-rc.d  foo default
2011-03-14T04:56:00.000Z	jrib	sabgenton	why do you keep referring to update-rc.d?
2011-03-14T04:57:00.000Z	jrib	sabgenton	you can check the status of the old sysv-init scripts using sysvrc-conf but as I keep repeating to you, scripts are migrating to use upstart, not sysv-init
2011-03-14T04:57:00.000Z	sabgenton	jrib	isn't that the defualt way to make a service come on at boot?
2011-03-14T04:57:00.000Z	jrib	sabgenton	no, that's the old way
2011-03-14T05:21:00.000Z	jrib	sabgenton	note, the sysv-init scripts still get run.  Upstart runs them so as not to cause issues
2011-03-14T05:03:00.000Z	sabgenton	jrib	sorry to be naive but how do I find if something is going to start on boot with upstart?
2011-03-14T05:03:00.000Z	jrib	sabgenton	read it's configuration file in /etc/init
2011-03-14T05:10:00.000Z	sabgenton	jrib	so for system v stuff that  isn't in /etc/init as upstart script  I can apt-get install sysvrc-conf ?
2011-03-14T05:10:00.000Z	jrib	sabgenton	yes
2011-03-14T05:11:00.000Z	sabgenton	jrib	I spose I should take down all my system v stuff and convert it to upstart
2011-03-14T05:15:00.000Z	sabgenton	jrib	can't see the package to install it
2011-03-14T05:16:00.000Z	jrib	sabgenton	sysv-rc-conf
2011-03-14T05:20:00.000Z	sabgenton	jrib	what was the last systemV supporting  ubuntu
2011-03-14T05:21:00.000Z	jrib	sabgenton	I don't remember.  Guess: 7.10
2011-03-14T05:24:00.000Z	jrib	sabgenton	what do you mean, you haven't implemented what?
2011-03-14T05:25:00.000Z	sabgenton	jrib	It appers I am not using upstart to start somethings
2011-03-14T05:32:00.000Z	jrib	sabgenton	yes, that's because not all packages have been converted yet
2011-03-14T05:33:00.000Z	sabgenton	jrib	gee you were almost talkingto me like I shoul't have anything not upstart
