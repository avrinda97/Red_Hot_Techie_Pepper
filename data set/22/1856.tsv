2009-12-23T00:52:00.000Z	D9	erUSUL	thanks, but i have basic questions, like "can I do a peer to peer network?"  I was told that if all I want to do is share files then, changing a directories properties to sharing will allow that.  is that true?
2009-12-23T00:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	D9	should be. that's just a way to activate samba
2009-12-23T00:53:00.000Z	D9	erUSUL	sorry are you saying that if I turn on the sharing i will be activating samba?  or are you saying I can peer to peer with samba?
2009-12-23T00:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	D9	the former
2009-12-23T00:54:00.000Z	D9	erUSUL	The manuals you sent me are for setting up servers and domains etc.   I don't need or want all that.
2009-12-23T00:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	D9	fair enough
2009-12-23T00:56:00.000Z	D9	erUSUL	 yikes... errors.  What does this mean? The following packages have unmet dependencies:   samba4: Depends: samba4-common (= 4.0.0~alpha6-1ubuntu1) but it is not going to be installed   E: Broken packages
2009-12-23T00:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	D9	what version of ubuntu are you using ?
2009-12-23T00:57:00.000Z	D9	erUSUL	 i have the last version
2009-12-23T00:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	D9	which is? do "lsb_release -a" in a terminal
2009-12-23T00:58:00.000Z	D9	erUSUL	9.04
2009-12-23T00:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	D9	last version is 9.10. and in 9.04 and 9.10 the sharing options do not need samba4 they need samba3...
2009-12-23T01:00:00.000Z	D9	erUSUL	so I should do the same command you gave me, but just change it to samba3 instead of 4?
2009-12-23T01:00:00.000Z	D9	erUSUL	E: Couldn't find package samba3
2009-12-23T01:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	D9	no; something is wrong in your system. are you sure is 9.04 and not 10.04 ??
2009-12-23T01:03:00.000Z	D9	erUSUL	2.6.28
2009-12-23T01:05:00.000Z	D9	erUSUL	I am sure it is 9.04
2009-12-23T01:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	D9	you should install samba not samba4
2009-12-23T01:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	D9	sudo aptitude install samba
2009-12-23T01:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	D9	what error you get ?
2009-12-23T01:14:00.000Z	D9	erUSUL	 it may not have worked because I opend synaptic when the samba4 did not work... will try after down load.
2009-12-23T01:35:00.000Z	D9	erUSUL	Can you set up a network, peer to peer, using live cd?
