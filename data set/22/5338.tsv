2007-08-07T15:24:00.000Z	Parisi		*Off topic* Could anyone suggest which would make a better chouce between a budget Acer 14'' or budget Toshiba 15'' notebook? Quality wise?
2007-08-07T15:26:00.000Z	faileas	Parisi	i'd suggest looking up the models in question on tuxmobile, if your gonna run linux on it
2007-08-07T15:27:00.000Z	faileas	Parisi	on technical stuff though, and monitor, i'd go for the toshiba.
2007-08-27T13:40:00.000Z	faileas	Parisi	Zara_thrustra: gparted has issues with the vista ntfa filesystem
2007-08-27T13:40:00.000Z	Parisi	faileas	I triple boot XP, VISTA and Ubuntu and have no problems, maybe im just special :(
2007-08-27T13:41:00.000Z	faileas	Parisi	XP fixes up the vista partiton when it boots
2007-08-27T13:43:00.000Z	Parisi	faileas	I see.
2007-08-27T13:43:00.000Z	faileas	Parisi	Zara_thrustra : actually i recommend moving the recovery partition to optical media first, then doing anything.
2007-08-27T13:44:00.000Z	Parisi	faileas	recovery what?
2007-08-27T13:44:00.000Z	faileas	Parisi	laptop recovery partitions? they don't play nice with grub ;)
2007-08-27T13:44:00.000Z	Parisi	faileas	ya i wipe those too :)
2007-08-27T13:44:00.000Z	faileas	Parisi	true, IF he has media
2007-08-27T13:46:00.000Z	Parisi	faileas	Acer has provided me Vista cd's go figure.
2007-08-27T13:51:00.000Z	faileas	Parisi	well the current ones are still ok
2007-08-27T15:34:00.000Z	faileas	Parisi	yeah it is
2007-08-27T15:34:00.000Z	faileas	Parisi	wonder when the promised port to linux will happen/the mainline client on linux will be moved
2007-08-27T15:35:00.000Z	Parisi	faileas	as in 24/7, i need rest.
2007-08-27T15:35:00.000Z	Parisi	faileas	I port would be nice, i thought there was one already.
2007-08-27T15:35:00.000Z	faileas	Parisi	beta i think
2007-08-27T15:36:00.000Z	Parisi	faileas	That wonderful, now all i need is mIRC and MSN Messenger :) j/k
2007-08-27T15:37:00.000Z	faileas	Parisi	MIRC sucks. MSNIM is getting more and more bloated ;)
2007-08-27T15:38:00.000Z	Parisi	faileas	haha, i like the way they look under Vista, eye candy.
