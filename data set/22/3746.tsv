2008-06-13T09:51:00.000Z	SonicComKid		Could someone please help me? I just want to install the GUI so I can work on this server
2008-06-13T09:51:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	What sort of GUI do you want?
2008-06-13T09:52:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	Did you want the full desktop?
2008-06-13T09:52:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	alright, are you connected to the internet on this box?
2008-06-13T09:52:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-destop
2008-06-13T09:53:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	No, you need to update first
2008-06-13T09:54:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	its just sudo apt-get update, and what it does is downloads the package lists from the interblags.  Before that, the only packages you knew about were those on the server CD (if that)
2008-06-13T09:56:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	did you `sudo apt-get update`?
2008-06-13T09:57:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	Do you have any package managers(aptitude, another apt-get, whatever) running?
2008-06-13T09:58:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	Don't.  What makes you think its running?
2008-06-13T09:58:00.000Z	SonicComKid	Flannel	because you asked
2008-06-13T09:58:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	Do you have a prompt? or something else?
2008-06-13T09:58:00.000Z	SonicComKid	Flannel	sudo apt-get install update   works, but  sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop is what gives me the error
2008-06-13T09:59:00.000Z	SonicComKid	Flannel	just the prompt, only thing it gives me
2008-06-13T09:59:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	alright, uh, try it again.  sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, same error?  and what are those error(s)?
2008-06-13T10:00:00.000Z	SonicComKid	Flannel	apparently it just didn't like me having the && thing between the commands. when I did each seporately it works
2008-06-13T10:01:00.000Z	SonicComKid	Flannel	thanks, seems to be working. It's downloading and starting now
2008-06-18T09:55:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	Check out "replace" instead.
2008-06-18T09:56:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	Oh, you need to do it for the contents?
2008-06-18T09:57:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	replace isnt a command its a program.  I... couldve sworn it was installed by default, but I suppose might not be anymore.
2008-06-18T09:58:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	The description around it didn't make sense re: contents.  Well, shucks.  That's quite a task.  At any rate.
2008-06-18T09:59:00.000Z	Flannel	SonicComKid	Lets take this to #ubuntu-offtopic, itll be less noisy for everyone involved
