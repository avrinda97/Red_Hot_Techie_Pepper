2007-10-21T17:51:00.000Z	MrPink	Psi-Jack	That would be great, thanks!
2007-10-21T17:55:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	MrPink	Yep
2007-10-21T17:51:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	MrPink	Actually, I can look that up on another computer's config, sec.
2007-10-21T17:52:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	MrPink	In your /etc/X11/xorg.conf, you need under your InputDevice for the mouse, Option "Buttons" "7", then Option "ButtonMapping" "1 2 3 6 7"
2007-10-21T17:53:00.000Z	MrPink	Psi-Jack	Ah I was missing the ButtonMapping
2007-10-21T17:53:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	MrPink	Yeah. ;)
2007-10-21T17:53:00.000Z	MrPink	Psi-Jack	thanks Ill give it a try!
2007-10-21T17:54:00.000Z	MrPink	Psi-Jack	What about "ZAxisMapping" ?
2007-10-21T17:54:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	MrPink	You have that already on "4 5" correct?
2007-10-21T17:54:00.000Z	MrPink	Psi-Jack	Yeah 4 5
2007-10-21T17:54:00.000Z	MrPink	Psi-Jack	That stays ?
2007-10-21T17:54:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	MrPink	Yeah, I was under that assumption you had that, so you're good
2007-10-21T17:54:00.000Z	MrPink	Psi-Jack	Ok Ill give it a shot one sec ;)
2007-10-21T17:55:00.000Z	MrPink	Psi-Jack	I have to restart X-server, right ?
2007-10-21T17:57:00.000Z	MrPink	Psi-Jack	Didn't work :-/
2007-10-21T17:57:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	MrPink	What didn't work about it?
2007-10-21T17:57:00.000Z	MrPink	Psi-Jack	my "next button" = my 2. Mousebutton and my "previous" button = my first Mousebutton
2007-10-21T17:59:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	MrPink	Hmm..

2007-10-21T18:02:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	MrPink	Might prove useful for the full MX500 stuff
2007-10-21T18:03:00.000Z	MrPink	Psi-Jack	Yeah I saw that.... but Ive done it sucessfully before... and I didnt do very much other than edit the xorg.conf... that explanation is like mucho long... I dont think it is necessary...
2007-10-21T18:03:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	MrPink	Well, things like Firefox won't know what the other buttons are for, without being mapped properly.
