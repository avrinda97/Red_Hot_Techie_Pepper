2012-02-05T05:22:00.000Z	ikonia	magicJ	they are probably locked accounts
2012-02-05T05:22:00.000Z	ikonia	magicJ	some accounts need a valid shell to do their tasks
2012-02-05T05:25:00.000Z	magicJ	ikonia	that is what I was worried about - how do I know which ones and why is this not a big security risk?
2012-02-05T05:25:00.000Z	ikonia	magicJ	trust the people who made the build
2012-02-05T05:26:00.000Z	magicJ	ikonia	OK - so how does trust help - what stops these ports being accessible ?
2012-02-05T05:26:00.000Z	ikonia	magicJ	you trust the people that made the build took reasonable security concerns into consideration
2012-02-05T05:27:00.000Z	magicJ	ikonia	but what could that be if there is a shell login defined?
2012-02-05T05:27:00.000Z	ikonia	magicJ	a shell of /bin/sh does not mean it can login
2012-02-05T05:29:00.000Z	magicJ	ikonia	aha - why does it not - what could stop it - I guess that is what I am really asking.  Surely if I have sshd enabled - which I do for an account I need then sshd is there and somone could login if they knew the user name and password
2012-02-05T05:29:00.000Z	ikonia	magicJ	what user accounts are you worried about ?
2012-02-05T05:31:00.000Z	magicJ	ikonia	all the early ones that the install set up - games, bin, daemon, etc
2012-02-05T05:31:00.000Z	ikonia	magicJ	they are locked accounts
2012-02-05T05:33:00.000Z	magicJ	ikonia	that's what I wanted to understand I guess - how are they locked?
2012-02-05T05:33:00.000Z	ikonia	magicJ	by locking them (that's what it's called) it stops them being usable as a login account
2012-02-05T05:34:00.000Z	magicJ	ikonia	OK - but how does one LOCK an account - I guess that is really the question I cam coming to
2012-02-05T05:34:00.000Z	ikonia	magicJ	essentials sets no valid password for it, so you can't login
2012-02-05T05:34:00.000Z	magicJ	ikonia	and what about games, is that locked?
2012-02-05T05:34:00.000Z	ikonia	magicJ	yes, it's locked
2012-02-05T05:35:00.000Z	magicJ	ikonia	TY - that's what I wanted to know - and so I assume that the root is that way too, yes?  And, if I wanted to set one that way myself how would I set what you call "no valid password"
2012-02-05T05:36:00.000Z	ikonia	magicJ	root is already locked
2012-02-05T05:36:00.000Z	magicJ	ikonia	This is GREAT - TY - so, if I wanted to set a "locked" one, how would I set "no valid password"
