2008-12-06T18:10:00.000Z	norbert79	tayfun	Just a simple question: What videocard do you own?
2008-12-06T18:10:00.000Z	norbert79	tayfun	And do you have the Nvidia driver installed?
2008-12-06T18:11:00.000Z	norbert79	tayfun	Think?
2008-12-06T18:11:00.000Z	norbert79	tayfun	Well the most fastest way would be on enabling 3d effects on extra... It will offer the driver by default≈±
2008-12-06T18:12:00.000Z	norbert79	tayfun	do "sudo dpkg -l | grep nvidia"
2008-12-06T18:14:00.000Z	norbert79	tayfun	Then you have no nvidia drivers installed :)
2008-12-06T18:16:00.000Z	norbert79	tayfun	sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings
2008-12-06T18:16:00.000Z	norbert79	tayfun	If you have that package installwed, you might just restart your X
2008-12-06T18:17:00.000Z	norbert79	tayfun	Use nvidia-settings
2008-12-06T18:23:00.000Z	norbert79	tayfun	Just restart your X using Ctrl+Alt+Backspace... That will close everything first of course
2008-12-06T18:25:00.000Z	norbert79	tayfun	Is the resolution better?
2008-12-06T18:25:00.000Z	norbert79	tayfun	Which version
2008-12-06T18:25:00.000Z	norbert79	tayfun	Which version
2008-12-06T18:30:00.000Z	norbert79	tayfun	Yes, but if you keep talkinmg you cannot be helped...
2008-12-06T18:36:00.000Z	norbert79	tayfun	couldn't be helped... He was in panic, and didn't want to be silent for a few moments
