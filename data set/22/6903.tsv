2007-03-13T12:33:00.000Z	sanityx		To disable the graphical boot screen, and see all the status messages as it boots, do I just delete the word splash from menu.lst?
2007-03-13T12:34:00.000Z	sanityx		whats the difference between splash and quiet?
2007-03-13T12:35:00.000Z	soundray	sanityx	so, remove both quiet and splash
2007-03-13T12:35:00.000Z	soundray	sanityx	yes
2007-04-21T14:42:00.000Z	soundray	sanityx	it lowers the latency of course
2007-04-21T14:42:00.000Z	sanityx	soundray	ok what does that mean
2007-04-21T14:43:00.000Z	soundray	sanityx	it means that it will respond within a shorter time, which can be important for signal processing.
2007-04-21T14:43:00.000Z	sanityx	soundray	why would you ever NOT want a low latency kernel?
2007-04-21T14:43:00.000Z	soundray	sanityx	there are some penalties associated
2007-04-21T14:44:00.000Z	soundray	sanityx	but I'm not enough of an expert to give you a precise answer.
2007-04-21T14:44:00.000Z	sanityx	soundray	ah ok. Well thanks for sharing what you know :-D
2007-04-21T14:45:00.000Z	soundray	sanityx	there's one thing that I can say for sure: the low-latency kernels scheduler is more complex and less well-tested than the scheduler that the regular kernel uses.
2007-04-28T07:23:00.000Z	soundray	sanityx	this is for a server
2007-04-28T07:23:00.000Z	sanityx	soundray	ooooooh.
2007-04-28T07:52:00.000Z	soundray	sanityx	many reasons. imap is much more flexible, especially when you're on the road
2007-04-28T07:53:00.000Z	sanityx	soundray	I was asking why people still use pop, not why they use imap.
2007-04-28T07:54:00.000Z	sanityx	soundray	Mistype :-D
2007-04-28T08:03:00.000Z	soundray	sanityx	everything
2007-04-28T08:03:00.000Z	soundray	sanityx	I'm still deaf from the squeals of people whose systems fell victim to automatix ;)
2007-04-28T08:09:00.000Z	soundray	sanityx	should work the same
2007-04-28T08:09:00.000Z	sanityx	soundray	cool.
2007-04-28T11:52:00.000Z	soundray	sanityx	with blkid
