2005-04-28T15:13:00.000Z	Shavnir		Okay, my internet still isn't working
2005-04-28T15:14:00.000Z	Shavnir		Any advice?
2005-04-28T15:14:00.000Z	jnk	Shavnir	what's the problem ?
2005-04-28T15:15:00.000Z	Shavnir	jnk	: Well, it dosen't work.  That seems to be the problem :p
2005-04-28T15:15:00.000Z	Shavnir	jnk	: There's a DHCP here on campus, but it isn't getting an IP from it
2005-04-28T15:19:00.000Z	jnk	Shavnir	have you tried a static ip ?
2005-04-28T15:19:00.000Z	Shavnir	jnk	: Well, given that I'm 100% positive the campus uses DHCP for assigning IP addressess, no
2005-04-28T15:20:00.000Z	jnk	Shavnir	this is usually not a problem, especially if you choose an ip outside the dhcp range
2005-04-28T15:20:00.000Z	Shavnir	jnk	: But I won't be able to access the network unless I'm inside the DHCPs range right?
2005-04-28T15:21:00.000Z	jnk	Shavnir	now you should have access to the network if you use an ip that is part of the network, but you won't automatically get the dns server addresses
2005-04-28T15:22:00.000Z	Shavnir	jnk	: Well, to be honest I don't know the range of IPs that the DHCP uses.  And I don't know how to setup a static IP
2005-04-28T15:23:00.000Z	jnk	Shavnir	look at the ip from another computer on the network. Choose you ip with the same xxx.xxx.xxx  (change only the 3 last digits). Run for example: ifconfig eth0 up xxx.xxx.xxx.yyy
2005-04-28T15:25:00.000Z	Shavnir	jnk	: Okay, I did that.
2005-04-28T15:25:00.000Z	jnk	Shavnir	now try pinging the other computer...
2005-04-28T15:26:00.000Z	Shavnir	jnk	: Destination host unreachable
2005-04-28T15:26:00.000Z	jnk	Shavnir	do you have several network interfaces ?
2005-04-28T15:26:00.000Z	Shavnir	jnk	: Four currently.
2005-04-28T15:26:00.000Z	Shavnir	jnk	: Of which one was recognized by Ubuntu :\
2005-04-28T15:27:00.000Z	Shavnir	jnk	: Two onboard gigabit ethernet that I can't get the nForce drivers to install for, a 802.11g card, and the 10/100 card I'm using so I can hopefully download the stuff to use the onboard two.
2005-04-28T15:28:00.000Z	jnk	Shavnir	eth0 is the 10/100 card ?
2005-04-28T15:28:00.000Z	Shavnir	jnk	: I think so?
2005-04-28T15:28:00.000Z	jnk	Shavnir	we'll try in pv
