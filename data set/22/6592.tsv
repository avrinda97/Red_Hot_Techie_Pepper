2007-08-05T05:42:00.000Z	mikej2j2		so... what do i need to change in xorg.conf, and if i get it wrong will it break my computer??
2007-08-05T05:43:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	You can also sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ;)
2007-08-05T05:50:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	What card do you have?
2007-08-05T05:51:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	Don't know what video card? eeeg... :P
2007-08-05T05:52:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	Go to terminal and type --- lspci | grep -i vga
2007-08-05T05:54:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	just pick intel :)
2007-08-05T05:54:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	You're golden - intel drivers work great... though you might not get right resolution right off... easy fix.... And you can run desktop effects out of the box...
2007-08-05T05:55:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	Erp, yeah sorry -- i8X  or i9X if available ....
2007-08-05T05:59:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	Should be 02:00 based on what you had above...
2007-08-05T05:59:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	You didn't do autodetect for dpkg ?
2007-08-05T06:00:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	Start dpkg again and have it autodetect :)
2007-08-05T06:00:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	You'll get it, hang in there...
2007-08-05T06:06:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	You can call it something if you want :)
2007-08-05T06:07:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	I think it's 02:00 based on what you pasted from lspci
2007-08-05T06:08:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	Ermm.. Dunno in the space provided?
2007-08-05T06:09:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	You cna hit tab or something to go down to it and edit or is a default number there?
2007-08-05T06:09:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	I think it should be 2:00 that was detected...
2007-08-05T06:09:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	Was it 2:00?
2007-08-05T06:16:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	THat should sort out the display - resolution might not be quite right, but that's an easy fix...
2007-08-05T06:16:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	Yep.. as it's picking up current settings...
2007-08-05T06:19:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	Pick native for your screen and the other pop ones if you like 1024x768 and so forth..
2007-08-05T06:28:00.000Z	ShackJack	mikej2j2	What is native resolution of your monitor - is it an LCD?
