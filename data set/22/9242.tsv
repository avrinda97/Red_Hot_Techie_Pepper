2005-01-20T13:41:00.000Z	mhisani		I guess i'll end up back on windows if i cant sort this out.
2005-01-20T13:42:00.000Z	nuOpus	mhisani	try and install firestarter if you have no experience in iptables
2005-01-20T13:43:00.000Z	mhisani	nuOpus	Okay. Ill take a look
2005-01-20T13:43:00.000Z	nuOpus	mhisani	It is a gui based firewall tool with a wizard
2005-01-20T13:43:00.000Z	nuOpus	mhisani	Just make sure that you have ONE nic going to the cable modem or router, and SECOND nic going to other machine or hum
2005-01-20T13:44:00.000Z	mhisani	nuOpus	Yeah, Thats what ive done
2005-01-20T13:44:00.000Z	nuOpus	mhisani	Then you will like firestarter. ive suggested that to windows people wanting to use linux to share internet and they have always been happy
2005-01-20T13:45:00.000Z	nuOpus	mhisani	Do you know how to install software through synaptic?
2005-01-20T13:45:00.000Z	nuOpus	mhisani	wooo thats different for new linux people! LOL. Anyway .. sudo apt-get install firestarter
2005-01-20T13:49:00.000Z	mhisani	nuOpus	Im not new to *nix in a medium user of BSD
2005-01-20T13:52:00.000Z	mhisani	nuOpus	This doesnt appear to work.
2005-01-20T13:52:00.000Z	nuOpus	mhisani	did it install at least?
2005-01-20T13:52:00.000Z	nuOpus	mhisani	You have to make sure you get the correct interface right for internet and other for internal
2005-01-20T13:57:00.000Z	mhisani	nuOpus	Any other ideas?
2005-01-20T14:00:00.000Z	nuOpus	mhisani	Well ... all firestarter does it configure iptables ... will not forwards DNS requests
2005-01-20T14:00:00.000Z	nuOpus	mhisani	go to one of your other computers and type ping 216.109.112.135
2005-01-20T14:01:00.000Z	nuOpus	mhisani	If you are able to ping that is good
2005-01-20T14:01:00.000Z	mhisani	nuOpus	request times out
2005-01-20T14:03:00.000Z	nuOpus	mhisani	And your linux box CAN get to the internet?
2005-01-20T14:06:00.000Z	mhisani	nuOpus	 done
2005-01-20T14:08:00.000Z	mhisani	nuOpus	Didnt appear to do anything
2005-01-20T14:12:00.000Z	mhisani	nuOpus	A reboot wont do anything will it
