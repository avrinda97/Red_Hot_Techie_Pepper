2006-06-08T11:00:00.000Z	cdubya	Some_Person	/etc/X11
2006-07-12T12:33:00.000Z	cdubya	Some_Person	I always Ctrl-C when I see the system boot.....
2006-07-12T12:46:00.000Z	cdubya	Some_Person	just a sec
2006-07-12T12:49:00.000Z	cdubya	Some_Person	have you tried to disable the connection in the Network Settings
2006-07-12T12:54:00.000Z	cdubya	Some_Person	did you ever say if you disabled the connection or not? I must have missed that
2006-07-12T12:55:00.000Z	cdubya	Some_Person	System > Administration > Networking
2006-07-12T12:55:00.000Z	cdubya	Some_Person	then click on your dial-up connection and disable it
2006-07-12T12:56:00.000Z	cdubya	Some_Person	as long as you don't need it enabled, then you should be good to go.....restart your machine and see if it tries after you login....
2006-07-12T13:00:00.000Z	Some_Person	cdubya	clicking disable completely disabled my dialup
2006-07-12T13:00:00.000Z	cdubya	Some_Person	umm, yes....
2006-07-12T13:02:00.000Z	cdubya	Some_Person	I've honestly not used dialup on ubuntu, just was suggesting a way you could stop it from auto-dialing as that's what you were asking.....
