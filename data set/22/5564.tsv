2007-04-29T14:35:00.000Z	Foon		possibly a dumb question; can I write files to a samba share from my windows system without it being fat32?
2007-04-29T14:36:00.000Z	Foon		I'm SSH'd into my LAMP server which I've installed Samba on
2007-04-29T14:36:00.000Z	Foon		I can't be arsed to create a fat32 partition
2007-04-29T14:37:00.000Z	Foon		oh
2007-04-29T14:37:00.000Z	Foon		in other words, I _have_ to use either a fat32 or ntfs partition?
2007-04-29T14:37:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Foon	to enable Ntfs writing use Ntfs-3g
2007-04-29T14:38:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		Hey!!!!!
2007-04-29T14:38:00.000Z	Foon		whoa... too much at once
2007-04-29T14:38:00.000Z	Foon	HOT	I've heard that automatix is a broken for newer revs
2007-04-29T14:38:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		I have a little question, why the "Eject" option has lost from an Usb device context menu
2007-04-29T14:38:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		It was there in Edgy
2007-04-29T14:39:00.000Z	Foon	HOT	also, I don't have an ntfs or fat32 partition (yet) under my linux machine
2007-04-29T14:39:00.000Z	Foon		ideally I'd like to avoid doing that, out of pure lazyness
2007-04-29T14:39:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		I have a little question, why the "Eject" option has lost from an Usb device context menu
2007-04-29T14:39:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		It was there in Edgy
2007-04-29T14:39:00.000Z	Foon		so I should just update to Feisty?
2007-04-29T14:40:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		I have a little question, why the "Eject" option has lost from an Usb device context menu
2007-04-29T14:40:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		It was there in Edgy
2007-04-29T14:40:00.000Z	Foon		also, is ntfs write reliable? I ask because I know there's a major difference between something being unsupported, and that same thing functioning as expected regardless of unsupportedness

2007-04-29T14:40:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		It was there in Edgy
2007-04-29T14:41:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Foon	i am using it and i can say it is reliable
