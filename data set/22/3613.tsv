2008-08-30T16:31:00.000Z	Markus		On my Ubuntu, I don't have access to /home, so I can't login or anything. Is there anyone who know how such a problem may be fixed?
2008-08-30T16:32:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	What do you mean you don't have access to home?
2008-08-30T16:32:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	But you can log in?
2008-08-30T16:33:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	Failsafe terminal?
2008-08-30T16:34:00.000Z	Markus	Dan6688	yes
2008-08-30T16:34:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=545239 Perhaps that might help.
2008-08-30T16:35:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	Markus: More like http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=545239 really.
2008-08-30T16:35:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	Okay, that was the same link. This is the right one: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=545242
2008-08-30T16:37:00.000Z	Markus	Dan6688	those people have problems with their X-server. My problem is the fact that I am locked out from /home and all its subfolders. This leaves me unable to log in in any other way than failsafe terminal, simply because all settings for GNOME (failsafe or not) is located inside the /home-directory.
2008-08-30T16:37:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	Maybe login as root and change permissions for the directories under /home?
2008-08-30T16:38:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	That's strange.
2008-08-30T16:39:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	"Subdirectories included"
2008-08-30T16:40:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	Do it with your username, not numbers.
2008-08-30T16:41:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	As in, a+x and the such.
2008-08-30T16:42:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	Could you paste them there?
2008-08-30T16:42:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	True. *rolls eyes*.
2008-08-30T16:43:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	What did it say when you tried to cd into /home?
2008-08-30T16:44:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	And you tried sudo, right?
2008-08-30T16:44:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	And did you become root and cd into it to see if you can?
2008-08-30T16:46:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	Have you installed Ubuntu recently or has this just "randomly" happened?
2008-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	Well, you shouldn't have write-permissions for /home, but you should have them for your _folder__under__/home_.
2008-08-30T16:49:00.000Z	Dan6688	Markus	=P
