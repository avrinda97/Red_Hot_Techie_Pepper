2005-05-03T15:22:00.000Z	holycow	|QuaD-	i've not thought the modifications are big at all
2005-05-03T15:23:00.000Z	|QuaD-	holycow	some are some aren't
2005-05-03T15:25:00.000Z	holycow	|QuaD-	thats not a good suggestion tho ... most user passwords are WEAK, never mind that they should be strong
2005-05-03T15:25:00.000Z	holycow	|QuaD-	which is really the shortcomming of the current setup, the root password ends up being a WEAK user pass, no good, that needs to be fixed
2005-05-03T15:26:00.000Z	|QuaD-	holycow	mine isnt weak, mine is like 12-15 chars, with upper and lower case, numbers, charachters, etc
2005-05-03T15:26:00.000Z	holycow	|QuaD-	you are not an average user, and ubuntu really makes it easy for an average user to use linux
2005-05-03T15:26:00.000Z	|QuaD-	holycow	well, then maybe suggest toubuntu dev's that they make some sort of password validator
2005-05-03T15:27:00.000Z	holycow	|QuaD-	no i will never do that, i will suggest that they create an admin account with a strong password requirement, and user acounts with no password testing
2005-05-03T15:27:00.000Z	|QuaD-	holycow	why?
2005-05-03T15:28:00.000Z	holycow	|QuaD-	because my suggestion makes more sense than the other suggestion that all users are root/admins ... this is linux not windows
2005-05-03T15:28:00.000Z	|QuaD-	holycow	everyone should have strong passwords
2005-05-03T15:28:00.000Z	holycow	|QuaD-	i don't see that ever happening, even if people use phrases that are easy to remember
2005-05-03T15:29:00.000Z	|QuaD-	holycow	well, i don't see how you can say that people shouldn't have strong password
2005-05-03T15:30:00.000Z	holycow	|QuaD-	i didn't, i just don't see it ever happening realistically, people will always either have weak pass or no pass logins, its just the nature of the situation, giving joe six pack sudo to everything therefore is just bad :)
2005-05-03T15:31:00.000Z	|QuaD-	holycow	well, i don't really care about how people create passwords, chances are anyone who needs the security has secure passwords, if not, they should learn more about using the technology they use and deserve to have their password cracked
2005-05-03T15:32:00.000Z	holycow	|QuaD-	oh i agree, but the problem is not 'should' or 'could' the problem is the default 'assumption' ... joe six pack has sudo access to everything, thats just bad imho
2005-05-03T15:33:00.000Z	|QuaD-	holycow	chances are if joe six pack has sudo access to everything its a home computer and doesn't need to be uber secure
2005-05-03T15:34:00.000Z	holycow	|QuaD-	really? i use it at work and it's also the 'default assumption' ... don't you think there needs to be a dialog about that decision?
2005-05-03T15:34:00.000Z	|QuaD-	holycow	to be honest, its not something i think about
2005-05-03T15:35:00.000Z	holycow	|QuaD-	obviously :)
2005-05-07T14:00:00.000Z	holycow	|QuaD-	just sit back and wait
2005-05-07T14:01:00.000Z	|QuaD-	holycow	it has been like 12 hours
