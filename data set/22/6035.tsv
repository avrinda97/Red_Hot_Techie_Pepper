2007-01-05T08:08:00.000Z	SubMOA		Morning.  Well, night here.
2007-01-05T08:09:00.000Z	SubMOA		there's kind of a stink when you convert .mp3 to .ogg, right?  It's better to rip into ogg?
2007-01-05T08:09:00.000Z	kenthomson	SubMOA	yes
2007-01-05T08:10:00.000Z	kenthomson	SubMOA	i too would like to know of that program, that doesn;t cause degradation when changing a file from .mp3 to .ogg, that would be a godsend gift
2007-01-05T08:11:00.000Z	SubMOA	kenthomson	I just heard-tell about it
2007-01-05T08:11:00.000Z	kenthomson	SubMOA	that would be really nice :)
2007-01-05T08:31:00.000Z	kenthomson	SubMOA	so you finally dug something up? :)
2007-01-05T08:33:00.000Z	SubMOA	kenthomson	sort of
2007-01-05T08:33:00.000Z	SubMOA	kenthomson	same problem, but this guy theorizes that if you use high quality MP3's, you can't tell the difference.
2007-01-05T08:34:00.000Z	kenthomson	SubMOA	but that should be applicable to simple programs that change mp3-->Ogg too! why use his script?
2007-01-05T08:34:00.000Z	kenthomson	SubMOA	hm..
2007-01-05T08:34:00.000Z	SubMOA	kenthomson	it was just something I saw... not really pushing his script more than others, but that's where the info was.  Anyway, just some food for thought.
2007-01-05T08:36:00.000Z	kenthomson	SubMOA	so you mean to say converting .mp3--->.ogg, and using FLAC as the container over VORBIS, and that should not let drop in quality occur? But i think it is THE PROCESS of conversion from .mp3--->.ogg that deters the audio in quality as both are lossy formats
2007-01-05T08:38:00.000Z	SubMOA	kenthomson	ohh, yea I have no idea how that works, I just read something about how you can have flac as the compression on an ogg file, so i figured I'd read up on it.  As i'm reading here, I starting to think that wouldn't work
2007-01-05T08:39:00.000Z	kenthomson	SubMOA	could you please provide that links to all the you are reading?
2007-01-05T08:40:00.000Z	kenthomson	SubMOA	:), but you could provide the links anyways
2007-01-05T08:42:00.000Z	SubMOA	kenthomson	ok, I went here and figured they would mention something about it if it was possible: http://flac.sourceforge.net/
2007-01-05T08:42:00.000Z	kenthomson	SubMOA	never mind
2007-01-05T08:42:00.000Z	SubMOA	kenthomson	more specifically, here http://flac.sourceforge.net/documentation_tasks.html
2007-01-05T08:42:00.000Z	SubMOA	kenthomson	there are more, do you want them?
2007-01-05T08:43:00.000Z	kenthomson	SubMOA	all of the
2007-01-05T08:43:00.000Z	kenthomson	SubMOA	all of them, and i am leaving if you could please make it fast
