2011-03-19T02:33:00.000Z	oCean	guntbert	a dpkg --set-selections (hold) does not prevent the actual package from showing up as available for update?
2011-03-19T02:34:00.000Z	guntbert	oCean	if "hold" does essentially the same as "lock" in synaptic, then "no", but I will try
2011-03-19T02:44:00.000Z	guntbert	oCean	in my case that seems not to help because I am talking about kernel versions, and they don't replace each other but just get added :-)
2011-03-19T02:45:00.000Z	oCean	guntbert	ah :(
2011-03-19T02:45:00.000Z	guntbert	oCean	thx for triggering my brain
2011-03-24T01:43:00.000Z	guntbert	oCean	the original file is not touched without an erroneous redirection...
2011-03-24T01:44:00.000Z	oCean	guntbert	using -i it will be
2011-03-24T01:45:00.000Z	guntbert	oCean	oops, overlooked that, thx
2011-03-24T01:45:00.000Z	oCean	guntbert	I learned that the hard way :)
2011-03-24T01:46:00.000Z	guntbert	oCean	thx for sparing us

2012-03-20T01:52:00.000Z	guntbert	oCean	thx,
2012-03-20T22:22:00.000Z	oCean	guntbert	not exactly what you are looking for, but you could mount the mini.iso (-o loop) to see what actually happens in the various menuoptions
2012-03-20T22:24:00.000Z	guntbert	oCean	good idea - but it seems somewhat strange that it isn't documented anywhere
2012-03-20T22:25:00.000Z	oCean	guntbert	agreed
