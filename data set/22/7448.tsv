2006-03-28T12:05:00.000Z	Hitokiri		hello
2006-03-28T12:06:00.000Z	Hitokiri		can someone help me?
2006-03-28T12:07:00.000Z	Hitokiri		I just installed Unbuntu and accidentally didn't get the right resolution set when it asked me for resolutions
2006-03-28T12:07:00.000Z	Hitokiri		I was wondering if there is a way to add more resolutions so that it can accomodate my widescreen powerbook
2006-03-28T12:08:00.000Z	Hitokiri		kk, thanks
2006-03-28T12:08:00.000Z	redwolf	Hitokiri	do you know what resolution you want?
2006-03-28T12:09:00.000Z	Hitokiri	redwolf	I think it's 1152x768 if I remember correctly
2006-03-28T12:09:00.000Z	redwolf	Hitokiri	sounds right....okay, open a terminal window
2006-03-28T12:09:00.000Z	Hitokiri		ok
2006-03-28T12:10:00.000Z	redwolf	Hitokiri	sudo nano -w /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-03-28T12:10:00.000Z	redwolf		or replace nano -w with your favorite editor
2006-03-28T12:10:00.000Z	Hitokiri		ok
2006-03-28T12:11:00.000Z	redwolf	Hitokiri	go down to the Screen section, near the bottom
2006-03-28T12:11:00.000Z	redwolf	Hitokiri	you'll see a couple of subsections, with various resolutions on different lines
2006-03-28T12:11:00.000Z	Hitokiri	redwolf	ok found it
2006-03-28T12:12:00.000Z	redwolf	Hitokiri	add "1152x768" (with quotes)  to each of those lines, right before the first resolution listed on each line
2006-03-28T12:12:00.000Z	redwolf	Hitokiri	make sure there's a space between each resolution, it might get confused otherwise
2006-03-28T12:13:00.000Z	Hitokiri	redwolf	kk, thanks
2006-03-28T12:13:00.000Z	redwolf	Hitokiri	save of course...that doesn't make it automatically get that, it gives you the option in control panels though
2006-03-28T12:13:00.000Z	redwolf	Hitokiri	you may have to restart x first...have fun
2006-03-28T12:14:00.000Z	Hitokiri	redwolf	ok, thanks so much for your help ^_^
