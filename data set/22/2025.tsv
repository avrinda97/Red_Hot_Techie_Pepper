2009-10-30T18:58:00.000Z	flan_suse		I asked in the xubuntu channel, but got no response: I'm having a problem with saving my wireless WPA passhprase using Xubuntu. I have "Start GNOME services" enabled, and I also installed "Seahorse" via Synaptics.
2009-10-30T18:58:00.000Z	flan_suse		However, the NetworkManager is not saving my WPA passphrase. And the one time it did, it left it unprotected (plaintext, not a hash, like GNOME does.)
2009-10-30T18:58:00.000Z	flan_suse		When I open up Seahorse, I cannot "change password" for the login key.

2009-10-30T18:59:00.000Z	flan_suse	module000	I don't like wicd.
2009-10-30T18:59:00.000Z	flan_suse	module000	wicd stores your passphrase in plaintext in a global file, accessible by anyone.
2009-10-30T18:59:00.000Z	module000	flan_suse	odd, mine does not, it's sha2'd
2009-10-30T19:00:00.000Z	flan_suse	module000	what version of wicd?
2009-10-30T19:00:00.000Z	module000	flan_suse	1.5.9
2009-10-30T19:00:00.000Z	module000	flan_suse	i had endless troubles with wifi in networkmanager though, that's what prompted the switch
2009-10-30T19:00:00.000Z	flan_suse	module000	I've tried the latest version of wicd, and it's still stored in the wireless.conf file, unhashed.
2009-10-30T19:01:00.000Z	module000	flan_suse	what flags are you compiling with? that should not be default behavior
2009-10-30T19:02:00.000Z	flan_suse	module000	not compiling. Binary .deb from the wicd ppa.
2009-10-30T19:03:00.000Z	module000	flan_suse	hrm..i don't haev any advice there, i don't know what flags they use in their binary offerings
2009-10-30T19:04:00.000Z	module000	flan_suse	back to network manager...have you tried destroying it's local settings and restarting it?  maybe there are some conflicting preferences saved causing adverse behavior
2009-10-30T19:04:00.000Z	flan_suse	module000	in my home directory you mean?
2009-10-30T19:05:00.000Z	module000	flan_suse	yes, just a shot in the dark though
2009-10-30T19:05:00.000Z	flan_suse	module000	I did not have this problem on Ubuntu. It only gives me this issue on Xubuntu.
2009-10-30T19:05:00.000Z	module000	flan_suse	does xubuntu also use network-manager by default?(i've never used it and don't know)
2009-10-30T19:06:00.000Z	module000	flan_suse	check(or possibly destroy) /etc/NetworkManager settigns also
2009-10-30T19:07:00.000Z	module000	flan_suse	some user-settings could be conflicting with some system-wide settings specified there
2009-10-30T19:07:00.000Z	flan_suse	module000	I'll check them out.
