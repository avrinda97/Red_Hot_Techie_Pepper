2007-08-15T09:21:00.000Z	Some_Person		So how do I make firefox use XChat for irc:// links?
2007-08-15T09:22:00.000Z	neverblue	Some_Person	there is an addon
2007-08-15T09:24:00.000Z	neverblue	Some_Person	its set as your default irc client, if you removed xchat-gnome, then you have to adjust the settings to make xchat the default irc client
2007-08-15T09:24:00.000Z	Some_Person	neverblue	And how do I do that? I removed xchat-gnome because I never used it.
2007-08-15T09:26:00.000Z	Some_Person	neverblue	How do I change the default IRC client?
2007-08-15T09:26:00.000Z	neverblue	Some_Person	you would do that inside FF, right?
2007-08-15T09:27:00.000Z	neverblue	Some_Person	you are trying to open this in FF, correct?
2007-08-15T09:27:00.000Z	Some_Person	neverblue	I don't know, but I doubt it. I would never tell FF to use xchat-gnome.
2007-08-15T09:27:00.000Z	neverblue	Some_Person	you dont have to, if its setup by default :/
2007-08-15T09:28:00.000Z	Some_Person	neverblue	I installed xchat-gnome myself, but then decided I preferred xchat. So I removed xchat-gnome.
2007-08-15T09:28:00.000Z	neverblue	Some_Person	you are basically just wanting to open irc in FF, which was your initial question, correct?
2007-08-15T09:28:00.000Z	Some_Person	neverblue	Shouldn't the setting be iin ubuntu instead of FF?
2007-08-15T09:28:00.000Z	neverblue	Some_Person	ubuntu doesnt open applications for you, you do that yourself
2007-08-15T09:28:00.000Z	Some_Person	neverblue	No, I want irc:// links to use xchat instead of xchat-gnome.
2007-08-15T09:29:00.000Z	neverblue	Some_Person	where are you visiting irc:// links at?
2007-08-15T09:29:00.000Z	Some_Person	neverblue	They are all over the web
2007-08-15T09:29:00.000Z	neverblue	Some_Person	in which applications
2007-08-15T09:29:00.000Z	Some_Person	neverblue	Firefox
2007-08-15T09:29:00.000Z	neverblue	Some_Person	then you need to set it in FF
2007-08-15T09:29:00.000Z	Some_Person	neverblue	From my experience in Windows, the setting is in the OS, not the browser.
2007-08-15T09:29:00.000Z	neverblue	Some_Person	please try and listen, we have gone full circle with this
2007-08-15T09:29:00.000Z	neverblue	Some_Person	then you do what you like
