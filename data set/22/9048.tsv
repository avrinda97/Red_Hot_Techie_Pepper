2005-05-09T05:48:00.000Z	amichai		ok i have no sound
2005-05-09T05:48:00.000Z	amichai		can someone help me?
2005-05-09T05:49:00.000Z	amichai		transgress,sto;; have no sound, switched to alsa, still
2005-05-09T05:50:00.000Z	amichai		ok its just xmms that does work
2005-05-09T05:50:00.000Z	amichai		mplayer works
2005-05-09T05:51:00.000Z	crimsun	amichai	which plugin is xmms configured to use?
2005-05-09T05:51:00.000Z	amichai	crimsun	esd
2005-05-09T05:52:00.000Z	crimsun	amichai	if esd isn't running, then you can't use the esound plugin for xmms
2005-05-09T05:52:00.000Z	crimsun	amichai	in that case, you need to use either the alsa or the oss output plugin for xmms
2005-05-09T05:52:00.000Z	amichai	crimsun	i just switched back to esd
2005-05-09T05:52:00.000Z	crimsun	amichai	if ,,pgrep esd'' returns nothing, then esd isn't running, and you'll need to change the output plugin that xmms uses
2005-05-09T05:53:00.000Z	amichai	crimsun	i switched to esd but grep esd showed nothing
2005-05-09T05:53:00.000Z	crimsun	amichai	you killed it before, remember?
2005-05-09T05:54:00.000Z	amichai	crimsun	ok i switched everything to alsa that works
2005-05-09T05:54:00.000Z	amichai	crimsun	esd doesnt though is that ok?
2005-05-09T05:55:00.000Z	crimsun	amichai	that's correct. You killed esd before, so esd isn't running, therefore you can't use xmms's esound output.
2005-05-09T05:56:00.000Z	amichai	crimsun	u agree with danko123456 ?
2005-05-09T11:48:00.000Z	crimsun	amichai	it'd be a bad idea
2005-05-09T11:48:00.000Z	crimsun	amichai	chances are you can find the software you need in universe or multiverse
2005-05-09T11:58:00.000Z	crimsun	amichai	I'm pretty sure all the Ubuntu developers are Debian developers.
2005-05-09T12:00:00.000Z	amichai	crimsun	?
2005-05-09T12:00:00.000Z	crimsun	amichai	yes, I still use Sid.
