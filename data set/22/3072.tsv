2009-01-04T00:14:00.000Z	Gletob		I just installed ubuntu on this computer It shows up in lspci but the ethernet light on my modem is not on even though it is connected.
2009-01-04T00:15:00.000Z	SuNDeC	Gletob	try installing wicd instead of the default network-manager
2009-01-04T00:17:00.000Z	SuNDeC	Gletob	i had the same prob before, resolved after installing wicd
2009-01-04T00:19:00.000Z	SuNDeC	Gletob	why? it fixed your prob anyway!
2009-01-04T00:20:00.000Z	SuNDeC	Gletob	so why not using wicd again?
2009-01-04T00:21:00.000Z	Gletob	SuNDeC	because this is a different pc and I just installed and never thought of it
2009-01-04T00:22:00.000Z	SuNDeC	Gletob	ok, misunderstood that you didn't like it :-)
2009-01-04T01:02:00.000Z	SuNDeC	Gletob	wicd does not work for you?
2009-01-04T01:05:00.000Z	SuNDeC	Gletob	does wicd see your card after installation?
2009-01-04T01:10:00.000Z	SuNDeC	Gletob	can i see the output of ifconfig command
2009-01-04T01:19:00.000Z	SuNDeC	Gletob	print the output of $ cat /etc/network/interfaces
2009-01-04T01:21:00.000Z	Gletob	SuNDeC	it lists the loopbacks: auto lo & iface lo inet loopback
2009-01-04T01:23:00.000Z	SuNDeC	Gletob	ok, you add 2 lines "auto eth0 & iface eth0 inet dhcp" (& means new line), then do the command $ dhclient eth0
2009-01-04T01:24:00.000Z	Gletob	SuNDeC	add two lines to what
2009-01-04T01:25:00.000Z	SuNDeC	Gletob	into the file /etc/network/interfaces
2009-01-04T01:29:00.000Z	Gletob	SuNDeC	Can you hold on just on second someone posted a fix on my forum thread and I'm trying that now.
2009-01-04T01:37:00.000Z	Gletob	SuNDeC	Thank you so much for your help but it turns out a setting in windows was messing me up in ubuntu aparantly windows would disable the card at shutdown and not reenable until next windows boot.  But thanks again
2009-01-04T01:38:00.000Z	SuNDeC	Gletob	i dont think so, cause i encounter this error before
2009-01-04T01:39:00.000Z	Gletob	SuNDeC	but changing this setting has fixed my ethernet.
2009-01-04T01:40:00.000Z	Gletob	SuNDeC	THe info is on this page http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Configuring_network#Realtek_No_Link_.2F_WOL_issue
