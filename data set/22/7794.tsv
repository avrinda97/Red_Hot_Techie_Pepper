2005-12-26T16:57:00.000Z	mcphail	Eleaf	this happened to me in hoary, but not breezy. It seemed to be a problem with the ATI drivers, but i'm not entirely sure.

2005-12-26T16:58:00.000Z	mcphail	Eleaf	I never got to the bottom of it, I'm afraid. As you say, nothing turned up in syslog.
2005-12-26T16:59:00.000Z	Eleaf	mcphail	my system is very stable, but for some reason it just suddenly did this...
2005-12-26T16:59:00.000Z	mcphail	Eleaf	ndiswrapper?
2005-12-26T16:59:00.000Z	mcphail	Eleaf	are you using it? it was my other potential culprit
2005-12-27T17:00:00.000Z	mcphail	Eleaf	have you checked your RAM?
2005-12-27T17:00:00.000Z	Eleaf	mcphail	it should be fine..
2005-12-27T17:01:00.000Z	mcphail	Eleaf	should, or is?
