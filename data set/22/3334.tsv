2008-12-05T21:38:00.000Z	pronoy		how do i download gnome 2.4 on kubuntu 8.10 and ultimately remove kde ?
2008-12-05T21:39:00.000Z	DRebellion	pronoy	sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
2008-12-05T21:39:00.000Z	DRebellion	pronoy	make sure stuff works, then, sudo aptitude purge kubuntu-desktop
2008-12-05T21:45:00.000Z	pronoy	DRebellion	is it possible stuff won't work ?!?!

2008-12-05T21:46:00.000Z	pronoy	DRebellion	and is kde better or gnome ?
2008-12-05T21:46:00.000Z	DRebellion	pronoy	i personally use gnome, but this is a matter of opinion
2008-12-05T21:47:00.000Z	pronoy	DRebellion	also...when they say intrepid is not a long terms support version...what do they mean ?
2008-12-05T21:47:00.000Z	DRebellion	pronoy	long term support (LTS) releases are officially supported with security/bug fixes for much longer than non-LTS releases
2008-12-05T21:48:00.000Z	pronoy	DRebellion	so would it be advisable to install intrepid ?
2008-12-05T21:48:00.000Z	DRebellion	pronoy	i would recommend intrepid
2008-12-05T21:49:00.000Z	pronoy	DRebellion	but it won't be supported for long ?!
2008-12-05T21:50:00.000Z	DRebellion	pronoy	not as long as the LTS releases, but then you can just update to 9.04 (jaunty) when it comes out! ;)
2008-12-05T21:51:00.000Z	pronoy	DRebellion	yeah...i guess....thanks for support
2008-12-05T22:01:00.000Z	pronoy	DRebellion	where are all the softwares installed...i mean which folder...e.g /etc ?
2008-12-05T22:01:00.000Z	DRebellion	pronoy	software is spread around the file system, for example /etc/ contains configuration files.
2008-12-05T22:02:00.000Z	pronoy	DRebellion	so during installation which folder needs to be alloted maximum space....if needed ?
2008-12-05T22:02:00.000Z	DRebellion	pronoy	i don't understand what you're asking?
2008-12-05T22:03:00.000Z	pronoy	DRebellion	because...last time i alloted 10 gigs just to /home...a new portion altogether...just thought all the softwares are installed there
2008-12-05T22:04:00.000Z	DRebellion	pronoy	/home is just for per-user configuration, and user's files like music and videos
2008-12-05T22:05:00.000Z	pronoy	DRebellion	ok...so /usr it is :)
