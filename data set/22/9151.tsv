2005-02-19T08:55:00.000Z	viper12		the glx and such may not work properly without that being there first.
2005-02-19T08:55:00.000Z	viper12		hoary or warty mem?  (can't remember what you'd said the install was.)

2005-03-05T10:35:00.000Z	membreya	viper12	do a hdparm -d /dev/{DVD DRIVE}
2005-03-05T11:24:00.000Z	membreya	viper12	the guide just says I need to enable a chipset in the kernel to support it

2005-03-12T10:59:00.000Z	membreya	viper12	I cant dump windows until I figure out transcoding xvid to mpeg2 to burn DVDs :)
