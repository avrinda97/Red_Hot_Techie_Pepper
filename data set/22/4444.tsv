2008-01-08T16:33:00.000Z	naxa	_moro_bana_	if you delete the windows partition in fdsik it won't harm ubuntu
2008-01-08T16:33:00.000Z	naxa	_moro_bana_	also you can do the same in gparted. you can delete the windows partition if there is no important data on it, it won't harm ubuntu
2008-01-08T16:35:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	naxa	thans to all
2008-01-08T16:41:00.000Z	naxa	_moro_bana_	if there are no partitions on it, first you should add partitions, for example with "gparted". after you should add lines for the new hdd's partitions to /etc/fstab as root in a text editor (sudo gedit /etc/fstab). examples for fstab can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab . also maybe there is an easier way these days i don't know i always do it like this.
2008-01-08T16:43:00.000Z	naxa	_moro_bana_	the basic idea is that you should mount any newly added partitions to some mount point. for example "mount /dev/hdd3 /media/disk3" would mount /dev/hdd3 (the 3rd partition of the "d" disk, which is the 4th (a,b,c,d)) to the directory /media/disk3 (/dev/hdd3 and /media/disk3 should both exist)
2008-01-08T16:43:00.000Z	naxa	_moro_bana_	fstab is a file what tells the system what should be mounted by default when the system starts
2008-01-08T16:44:00.000Z	naxa	_moro_bana_	so after you add new partitions to the new hdd with gparted you should mount them and they're ready to use
