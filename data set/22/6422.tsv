2006-11-14T07:59:00.000Z	saif		woohoo! finally got beryl+xgl on my ati 200m with fglrx 8.24 with dapper! :)
2006-11-14T07:59:00.000Z	saif		any news on amd opening up the ati drivers?
2006-11-14T07:59:00.000Z	morphish	saif	interesting, as i have that chipset in my lapto
2006-11-14T07:59:00.000Z	saif	morphish	very annoying isn't it?
2006-11-14T08:00:00.000Z	morphish	saif	just that i have edgy and not yet bothered with the fglrx drivers, which are now up to 8.30.something
2006-11-14T08:00:00.000Z	saif	morphish	the fglrx drivers dont work! :)
2006-11-14T08:00:00.000Z	saif	morphish	only 8.24 works
2006-11-14T08:00:00.000Z	saif	morphish	for the ati 200m that is!
2006-11-14T08:01:00.000Z	morphish	saif	i ran 8.28.8 last on my 200m (amd64 laptop)
2006-11-14T08:01:00.000Z	saif	morphish	and u got 3d rendering?
2006-11-14T08:01:00.000Z	morphish	saif	aye
2006-11-14T08:02:00.000Z	saif	morphish	HOW!!!
2006-11-14T08:02:00.000Z	saif	morphish	i tried everything, and i couldn't get 3d rendering! that's y i reverted to dapper ( the 8.24 work on dapper, and i dont know how to install them on edgy! :S )
2006-11-14T08:03:00.000Z	morphish	saif	i used the ati installer in sourcemage last, but there amd64 is not so nice 32bit/64bit wise (Although i have made a spell for 32bit libs for it) so i had to move some stuff around, the installer puts libGL.so.2 and friends in /usr/X11R6 dirs when the lib and the drivers should be in the right /usr/lib/xorg dirs
2006-11-14T08:04:00.000Z	morphish	saif	in other words i went around the package manager of a distro and i got it working, just moved 32bit libs in its own place, left 64bit where ldd looked for them , added the location for the 32bit libs to ld.so.conf and voila got it all happy, but i might be better in doing it rather than explaining it
2006-11-14T08:06:00.000Z	saif	morphish	i've talked to a lot of ppl who were suffering from this driver and this particular chipset, even the ati fglrx howto says it's not supported, y don't u write a howto or somethn, coz it seems a bit out my league to figure out, and i am sure a lot of ppl would appreciate it!
2006-11-14T08:07:00.000Z	morphish	saif	hm, now i am curious about installing it, and i have no idea why you say it is not supported, we are both talking about the Xpress 200m, right? last time i looked it said it is supported
2006-11-14T08:07:00.000Z	saif	morphish	hold on, i'll post the howto that i use
2006-11-14T08:08:00.000Z	morphish	saif	eff the howto if it says something that is not matching the release notes ;)
2006-11-14T08:10:00.000Z	saif	morphish	i have suffered with this card since 8.18 with different workarounds, the relase notes on the ati website always said that it is supported, when it actually isn't,
2006-11-14T08:15:00.000Z	morphish	saif	and i have had many release since 8.16.20 running, last one i ran was 8.28.8, but brb
2006-11-14T08:16:00.000Z	saif	morphish	:S what is ur computer? mine is a hp pavilion 5094 with amd64 ml-37! i guess u have some kind of lucky combination!
