2007-12-04T13:04:00.000Z	scguy318	Mashi	right click in Network Manager I think
2007-12-04T13:07:00.000Z	Mashi	scguy318	Thanks, that was a lot less complicated than the last distro I tried this with. On a similar note, is there a way to scan SSID's in that program, or do I need another one to do so?
2007-12-04T13:07:00.000Z	scguy318	Mashi	click on the network manager icon
2007-12-04T13:07:00.000Z	scguy318	Mashi	that should show a list of SSIDs I think
2007-12-04T13:08:00.000Z	scguy318	Mashi	else iwconfig scan nameofinterface
2007-12-04T13:08:00.000Z	Mashi	scguy318	I think I'm in the wrong menu then, I'm going admin -> network and seeing a wireless eth1 option, though the other thing you said will work
2007-12-04T13:09:00.000Z	scguy318	Mashi	there should be like a computer icon in notification tray
2007-12-04T13:09:00.000Z	scguy318	Mashi	if you click on it should show you a list of SSIDs if I'm not mistaken
2007-12-04T13:09:00.000Z	scguy318	Mashi	thats the network manager applet tray icon
2007-12-04T13:10:00.000Z	Mashi	scguy318	That's not working, but I know what you mean now. I probably just messed up installing the drivers for my card or something, I'll toy with it for a while. Thanks.
2007-12-04T13:10:00.000Z	scguy318	Mashi	you can try iwconfig scan eth1 (I think that's what you said)
2007-12-04T13:16:00.000Z	scguy318	Mashi	edit /etc/modules
2007-12-04T13:16:00.000Z	scguy318	Mashi	by doing gksudo gedit /etc/modules
2007-12-04T13:16:00.000Z	scguy318	Mashi	add an entry for ndiswrapper
2007-12-05T09:45:00.000Z	scguy318	Mashi	issue, Adobe seems to have updated their tar recently
