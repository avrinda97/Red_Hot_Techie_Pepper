2005-06-12T07:41:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	you mean if resierfs supports quota, then yes
2005-06-12T08:57:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	check the cd is fine
2005-06-15T10:48:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	port 110 is only used by pop3.  only you know if you need that or not.
2005-06-15T10:48:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	i810?
2005-06-15T10:48:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	er
2005-06-15T10:49:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	no one can help you answer that question, sorry
2005-06-15T10:49:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	do you want a pop server?  do you know what one is?  what are you trying to do?
2005-06-15T10:49:00.000Z	ablyss	bob2	i ran both smtpd and pop3d for years
2005-06-15T10:50:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	apparently not on unix
2005-06-15T10:50:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	so, pick a pop3 server and install it.  dovecot-pop3 is nice
2005-06-15T10:50:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	nothing is wrong with it
2005-06-15T10:51:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	no smtp server does pop3 on unix
2005-06-15T10:51:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	this is how proper mail systems work
2005-06-15T10:51:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	you install a smtp server, which sends and receives mail.
2005-06-15T10:51:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	if you want pop, you install a pop server, too
2005-06-15T10:53:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	what pop3/smtp server have you used that did both?
2005-06-15T11:03:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	there's no "64 bit hoary", there is an amd64 port, tho
2005-06-15T11:05:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	yes, but so do lots of other architectures
2005-06-27T07:20:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	that's not a proble,, it just means you have your old wone in your path before the new one
2005-06-27T07:20:00.000Z	bob2	ablyss	get rid of the one you don't want
2005-08-27T09:21:00.000Z	ablyss	bob2	you dont sleep much do you ? :)
