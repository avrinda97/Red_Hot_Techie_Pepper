2012-04-05T11:35:00.000Z	paulus68		is there an easy way to check if a user is connected to my proxy? I also want to be notified by mail when this user is connected to my proxy? how do I achieve this
2012-04-05T11:36:00.000Z	bekks	paulus68	No, there is no easy way.
2012-04-05T11:38:00.000Z	paulus68	bekks	ok is there a way to achieve this I am using squid?
2012-04-05T11:38:00.000Z	bekks	paulus68	Sounds like heavy scripting, on-the-fly log file analysis, and usage of cron and smtp to inform you via mail.
2012-04-05T11:38:00.000Z	paulus68	bekks	ok
2012-04-05T12:51:00.000Z	bekks	paulus68	I told you "no" already ;)
2012-04-05T12:51:00.000Z	bekks	paulus68	You have to grep the logs.
2012-04-05T12:51:00.000Z	paulus68	bekks	I know what you said
2012-04-05T14:21:00.000Z	bekks	paulus68	"man grep" :) or egrep - grep "this|that" filename
2012-04-05T14:26:00.000Z	paulus68	bekks	thanks
2012-04-05T14:34:00.000Z	bekks	paulus68	What do you want to do?
2012-04-05T14:35:00.000Z	paulus68	bekks	from the given access.log I want to get the username and the word denied in order to know what type of website this user wanted to access without my permission
2012-04-05T14:36:00.000Z	bekks	paulus68	So why do you want sed then?
2012-04-05T14:36:00.000Z	bekks	paulus68	Provide a single line of your access.log and provide the wanted output you want to have
2012-04-05T14:36:00.000Z	paulus68	bekks	Teak was proposing this to me I am trying to get used to the grep command
2012-04-05T14:36:00.000Z	paulus68	bekks	ok hold on
2012-04-05T14:41:00.000Z	paulus68	bekks	where before the DIRECT the username is mentioned
2012-04-05T14:46:00.000Z	paulus68	bekks	me watching and learning :)
2012-04-05T14:47:00.000Z	paulus68	bekks	any sugestions concerning my little problem ;)
2012-04-05T15:00:00.000Z	paulus68	bekks	any thoughts?
