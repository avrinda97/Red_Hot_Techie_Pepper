2007-04-06T10:46:00.000Z	ctothej		how can I start my ssh server?
2007-04-06T10:47:00.000Z	Daverocks	ctothej	sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
2007-04-06T10:48:00.000Z	ctothej	Daverocks	thanks. what about checking my ip address via command?
2007-04-06T10:48:00.000Z	Daverocks	ctothej	your internal IP, do ifconfig
2007-04-06T10:49:00.000Z	ctothej	Daverocks	awesome thank you
2007-04-06T10:49:00.000Z	Daverocks	ctothej	yeah, there may be multiple interfaces there, make sure you're looking at the right one
2007-04-06T10:50:00.000Z	ctothej	Daverocks	It fails.
2007-04-06T10:50:00.000Z	Daverocks	ctothej	what fails? the ifconfig command?
2007-04-06T10:51:00.000Z	ctothej	Daverocks	says [fail]  next to the message Starting OpenBSD Secure Shell server...
2007-04-06T10:52:00.000Z	Daverocks	ctothej	netstat -tan | grep :22
2007-04-06T10:52:00.000Z	Daverocks	ctothej	assuming the ssh server is running on default port
2007-04-06T10:53:00.000Z	ctothej	Daverocks	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14227/
2007-04-06T10:54:00.000Z	Daverocks	ctothej	yeah, you've already got a ssh server running
2007-04-06T10:55:00.000Z	Daverocks	ctothej	usually yes, try ssh 127.0.0.1
2007-04-06T10:55:00.000Z	ctothej	Daverocks	yep, i connect. thank you very much.
2007-04-06T10:56:00.000Z	Daverocks	ctothej	np
2007-04-06T11:02:00.000Z	Daverocks	ctothej	the root account is locked by default on ubuntu, meaning you can't login as root
2007-04-06T11:03:00.000Z	ctothej	Daverocks	oh interesting. as long as I can run commands as root using sudo i should be fine then
2007-04-06T11:03:00.000Z	Daverocks	ctothej	sudo is used to give certain users root privs, but having the root account locked allegedly provides extra security
2007-04-06T11:03:00.000Z	Daverocks	ctothej	try sudo -i, it'll give you a root shell
2007-04-06T11:04:00.000Z	ctothej	Daverocks	ah nice. just what i was looking for.
2007-04-06T11:04:00.000Z	Daverocks	ctothej	^_^
