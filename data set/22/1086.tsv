2011-09-25T01:57:00.000Z	ska		I have an old eee PC from asus, it only has 4gb of storage on it (solid state). What version, if any, can I put on it?
2011-09-25T01:57:00.000Z	KM0201	ska	lubuntu would probably work well.. it takes about 2.x gigs w/ a full install
2011-09-25T01:58:00.000Z	ska	KM0201	do i need a special install source?
2011-09-25T01:58:00.000Z	KM0201	ska	a special source?
2011-09-25T01:58:00.000Z	ska	KM0201	i see it now..
2011-09-25T01:59:00.000Z	KM0201	ska	if you've got ubuntu-desktop, you may not have enough room to install lubuntu-desktop, id do a clean lubuntu install, but thats just me
2011-09-25T02:00:00.000Z	ska	KM0201	yea, this think has windows.. I need to make a bootable usb on my other workstation.
2011-09-25T02:01:00.000Z	KM0201	ska	lubuntu.net  download it and put it n a USB, and boot it and try it.
2011-09-25T02:01:00.000Z	KM0201	ska	if you dont like it, no harm no foul.
2011-09-25T02:03:00.000Z	ska	KM0201	Do I need to use the USB Disk Creator tool?
2011-09-25T02:03:00.000Z	KM0201	ska	yes
2011-09-25T02:03:00.000Z	KM0201	ska	download the Lubuntu ISO from lubuntu.net (i'd get 11.04), then use the USB disk creator to put the ISO on a USB, then boot the USB on the netbook.
2011-09-25T02:04:00.000Z	ska	KM0201	thanks.. I also hear that the new Ubuntu 11.X had an eee-pc image inside it too.
2011-09-25T02:04:00.000Z	ska	KM0201	or something similar.
2011-09-25T02:04:00.000Z	KM0201	ska	i don't really know about that... it has a weird interface that i guess some may compare to some netbook interfaces (called Unity) but it sucks IMO..
2011-09-25T02:58:00.000Z	ska	KM0201	The lubuntu iso doesn't seem to be liked by usb-creator.. not sure why.
2011-09-25T02:59:00.000Z	KM0201	ska	it works fine, i've done it numerous times
2011-09-25T03:00:00.000Z	ska	KM0201	for some reason when I click on it, the "make disk" greys out.
2011-09-25T03:00:00.000Z	KM0201	ska	did the ISO completely download?
2011-09-25T03:03:00.000Z	ska	KM0201	I think so, but I can't find any md5sums to compare
2011-09-25T03:07:00.000Z	ska	KM0201	Should I dl the "mini.iso" for netboot instead of the full iso?
2011-09-25T03:07:00.000Z	KM0201	ska	if you want
