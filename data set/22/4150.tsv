2008-06-12T01:52:00.000Z	snarkster		im getting segmentation faults.. whats the est approach to fix these?
2008-06-12T01:53:00.000Z	Chousuke	snarkster	segfaults shouldn't happen
2008-06-12T01:53:00.000Z	snarkster	Chousuke	right I know
2008-06-12T01:53:00.000Z	Chousuke	snarkster	there are three possible causes: 1) a bug in the program, 2) your binary being corrupted (reinstall might help) or 3) broken hardware, such as faulty memory
2008-06-12T01:53:00.000Z	Chousuke	snarkster	1 and 3 are the most common
2008-06-12T01:54:00.000Z	snarkster	Chousuke	what about corruption on a HD
2008-06-12T01:54:00.000Z	Chousuke	snarkster	that falls into 2)
2008-06-12T01:54:00.000Z	snarkster	Chousuke	 It is a laptop
2008-06-12T01:54:00.000Z	Chousuke	snarkster	is it only one app that segfaults?
2008-06-12T01:56:00.000Z	Chousuke	snarkster	you should run memtest to see if your memory is alright
2008-06-12T01:56:00.000Z	Chousuke	snarkster	well, HD corruption is another possibility
2008-06-12T01:57:00.000Z	Chousuke	snarkster	there's no way to check "a HD". You need to check the filesystem
2008-06-12T01:57:00.000Z	Chousuke	snarkster	fsck is the command for that
2008-06-12T01:57:00.000Z	snarkster	Chousuke	 right fsck thats what i meant.. Ill have to boot up live cd and do it from there
2008-06-12T01:58:00.000Z	Chousuke	snarkster	it might not catch all corruption though. :/
2008-06-12T01:58:00.000Z	snarkster	Chousuke	 well thats not good
2008-06-12T01:58:00.000Z	Chousuke	snarkster	better back up any important data you have as soon as possible.
2008-06-12T01:59:00.000Z	snarkster	Chousuke	its my boot drive, no important data there
2008-06-12T01:59:00.000Z	Chousuke	snarkster	it might be that the binaries are just corrupted *or* that they have bugs, but if more things start crashing, it's most likely the hardware
2008-06-12T02:00:00.000Z	Chousuke	snarkster	in anycase, reinstall the affected software and see if that helps
2008-06-12T02:01:00.000Z	Chousuke	snarkster	preferably using apt-get --purge remove (which will remove all configuration as well)
2008-06-12T02:01:00.000Z	Chousuke	snarkster	and do an "apt-get clean" first so it'll remove your cached packages
