2012-06-16T08:20:00.000Z	skyl		what motherboard/sound/graphics should I get, toppish of the line, 100% supported?
2012-06-16T08:20:00.000Z	reisio	skyl	toppish?
2012-06-16T08:20:00.000Z	reisio	skyl	what are you going to do with the computer?
2012-06-16T08:21:00.000Z	skyl	reisio	some OpenGL and some realtime sound will probably be the most tricky things
2012-06-16T08:21:00.000Z	reisio	skyl	probably your average $300-$400 computer from BestBuy would suffice, and they have a decent return policy, IIRC
2012-06-16T08:22:00.000Z	skyl	reisio	hrm *probably* .. nah, spin the wheel of fortune and get some crappy unsupported graphics
2012-06-16T08:23:00.000Z	reisio	skyl	like 95% probably
2012-06-16T08:23:00.000Z	reisio	skyl	it's simple enough to scope out the hardware specs and look them up online before purchase, though
2012-06-16T08:23:00.000Z	reisio	skyl	http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/ has some specific models
2012-06-16T08:23:00.000Z	reisio	skyl	http://google.com/ has most of the rest
2012-06-16T08:27:00.000Z	skyl	reisio	I'm looking at motherboards with onboard video and sound, skeptically; but, you think that the sound and video are likely to be well supported?
2012-06-16T08:28:00.000Z	reisio	skyl	yes, but you can also get dedicated video hardware for the cost I already mentioned
2012-06-16T08:28:00.000Z	reisio	skyl	most people that aren't audio producers don't need dedicated audio
2012-06-16T08:35:00.000Z	reisio	skyl	that's not a big deal on even cheap modern hardware
2012-06-16T08:36:00.000Z	reisio	skyl	$300-400 can easily get you a >2GHz 64-bit dual core with virt extensions, 4GB RAM, and dedicated graphics
2012-06-16T08:36:00.000Z	reisio	skyl	probably with a monitor
2012-06-16T08:37:00.000Z	skyl	reisio	you've never compiled webkit?
2012-06-16T08:37:00.000Z	reisio	skyl	are you suggesting I haven't compiled webkit because it makes any computer crawl?
2012-06-16T08:37:00.000Z	skyl	reisio	no b/c 8 cores is going to be way faster than 2 ...
2012-06-16T08:38:00.000Z	reisio	skyl	what does '8 > 2' have to do with whether I've compiled webkit or not?
2012-06-17T08:47:00.000Z	reisio	skyl	sudo blkid
2012-06-17T08:47:00.000Z	skyl	reisio	yay, thanks!
