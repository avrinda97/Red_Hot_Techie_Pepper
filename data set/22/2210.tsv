2009-09-06T10:24:00.000Z	smogattack		what can I do? Someone is using my ip to sign people up for spam!!?
2009-09-06T10:24:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	smogattack	be more specific
2009-09-06T10:25:00.000Z	smogattack	^mNotIntelligent	I receive some emails saying I violated the Terms and Agreements on a website and from someone I know on a website saying my IP address popped up on the newsletters "sent by me"
2009-09-06T10:26:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	smogattack	do you use static ip? I guess yes
2009-09-06T10:27:00.000Z	smogattack	^mNotIntelligent	I have no idea! I don't know what to do now.
2009-09-06T10:29:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	smogattack	your prob seem to quite weird...never heard of something like this
2009-09-06T10:30:00.000Z	smogattack	^mNotIntelligent	is someone like snooping on my connection and then using my ip to sign people up for newsletters?
2009-09-06T10:30:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	smogattack	quite possible
2009-09-06T10:30:00.000Z	smogattack	^mNotIntelligent	how is that even possible though?
2009-09-06T10:30:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	smogattack	but people wont do that unless someone specifically targets your IP
2009-09-06T10:31:00.000Z	smogattack	^mNotIntelligent	you mean the other person sets their ip the same as mine or something?
2009-09-06T10:31:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	smogattack	they can spoof your ip, right?
2009-09-06T10:31:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	smogattack	answer this: does your ip remain same everytimne to connect to net?
2009-09-06T10:32:00.000Z	smogattack	^mNotIntelligent	so anyone who can snoop on my connection can do that to me?
2009-09-06T10:32:00.000Z	smogattack	^mNotIntelligent	I believe so. I usually check my IP on whatismyip and it's always the same
2009-09-06T10:33:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	smogattack	then someone is spoofing your ip, and he is specifically targeting you, so be cautious
2009-09-06T10:34:00.000Z	smogattack	^mNotIntelligent	so there's nothing I could do now? Just contact my ISP?
2009-09-06T10:35:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	smogattack	thats the first step, and ask if possibly you can have dynamic ip
2009-09-06T10:35:00.000Z	smogattack	^mNotIntelligent	and I should shut off my router as well?
2009-09-06T10:36:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	smogattack	you dont need to do that,,,but make sure you communicate this prob to your ISP at the earliest
2009-09-06T10:41:00.000Z	smogattack	^mNotIntelligent	thank you very much!!
2009-09-06T10:41:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	smogattack	you're welcome dude
