2009-08-01T22:42:00.000Z	GArReT		Hi guys. Today i downloaded and installed The newest ubuntu on my computer...
2009-08-01T22:42:00.000Z	GArReT		But i have a problem... i cant find TCL nor Building Essentials
2009-08-01T22:42:00.000Z	GArReT		where can i get it?
2009-08-01T22:42:00.000Z	grawity	GArReT	Open a package manager (System -> Administration -> Synaptic), or if you prefer, go to Terminal, and install the 'build-essential' and 'tcl' packages.
2009-08-01T22:43:00.000Z	GArReT	grawity	i cant find it in there
2009-08-01T22:44:00.000Z	grawity	GArReT	How about "apt-get install build-essential"?
2009-08-01T22:44:00.000Z	grawity	GArReT	Pastebin your sources.list please?
2009-08-01T22:48:00.000Z	GArReT	grawity	i'm just restarting my ubuntu pc again... i'll be back in 15 minutes... need to go help my mother
2009-08-01T23:02:00.000Z	GArReT	grawity	ok i'm back. When I Do "Sudo apt-get install build-essential" it says "Could not find package"
2009-08-01T23:02:00.000Z	grawity	GArReT	Can you try "sudo apt-get update"?
2009-08-01T23:03:00.000Z	GArReT	grawity	i will need the internet for this right?
2009-08-01T23:03:00.000Z	grawity	GArReT	Yes.
2009-08-01T23:06:00.000Z	GArReT	grawity	how much CAP will this update need?
2009-08-01T23:07:00.000Z	grawity	GArReT	I have no idea what does 'CAP' mean, but apt-get update only re-downloads the package lists, shouldn't be more than a few megs. (Probably less.)
2009-08-01T23:14:00.000Z	GArReT	grawity	isnt there a place where i can download the Build essentials and TCL without doing the "update" function
2009-08-01T23:14:00.000Z	grawity	GArReT	http://packages.ubuntu.com/ , but why do you need that?
2009-08-01T23:14:00.000Z	grawity	GArReT	Um, the 'update' command only downloads the package _list_
2009-08-02T00:54:00.000Z	grawity	GArReT	Did you do 'apt-get update'?
2009-08-02T00:54:00.000Z	grawity	GArReT	Ah.
2009-08-02T00:55:00.000Z	grawity	GArReT	Can you download them from packages.ubuntu.com?
2009-08-02T00:55:00.000Z	grawity	GArReT	Using another computer.
2009-08-02T00:57:00.000Z	GArReT	grawity	isnt there a command which i can install lib6 or something like that?
