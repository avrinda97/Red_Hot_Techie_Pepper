2008-04-30T20:45:00.000Z	moveax		How do you start the sshd in Ubuntu?
2008-04-30T20:46:00.000Z	moveax		Doesn't seem to be the common binary in /etc/init.d
2008-04-30T20:48:00.000Z	moveax		So what's the difference between 'apt-get' and 'aptitude'?
2008-04-30T20:49:00.000Z	bazhang	moveax	aptitude sometime handles deps better
2008-05-02T23:14:00.000Z	moveax	bazhang	-9 forces the process to quit, forcefully.
2008-05-02T23:14:00.000Z	bazhang	moveax	bad idea in this case? also what was your issue sorry I missed it thanks
2008-05-02T23:15:00.000Z	moveax	bazhang	it could be bad, could not be
2008-05-02T23:15:00.000Z	moveax	bazhang	generally it's OK
2008-05-02T23:15:00.000Z	moveax	bazhang	ps aux | grep gnome-panel
2008-05-02T23:15:00.000Z	moveax	bazhang	kill -9 <pid from the previous command>
2008-05-02T23:17:00.000Z	moveax	bazhang	My issue is i can't get the minimal install cd to install from my local mirror
2008-05-02T23:21:00.000Z	bazhang	moveax	you edited your sources.list to reflect only that mirror?
2008-05-02T23:22:00.000Z	moveax	bazhang	it's from the install cd, there is no sources.list - the mirror works fine as a mirror for updates and installing stuff, but it doesn't work when I try to use it as a network install point. Says it was unable to download a certain file.
2008-05-02T23:22:00.000Z	bazhang	moveax	you say mirror; would that act as a source though?
2008-05-02T23:24:00.000Z	moveax	bazhang	yes, as it has everything there. I'm wondering if the mirror needs the -src debs downloaded, too?
2008-05-02T23:24:00.000Z	moveax	bazhang	when you install from one of the dedicated mirrors, it's the same thing - apt-mirror downloads everything, apparently.
2008-05-02T23:25:00.000Z	bazhang	moveax	everything? the entire 45gb of repos?
2008-05-02T23:25:00.000Z	moveax	bazhang	If you tell it to, yes
2008-05-02T23:25:00.000Z	moveax	bazhang	I didn't download -sr or security updates, though. I'm wondering if I need them?
2008-05-02T23:26:00.000Z	bazhang	moveax	let me check something
2008-05-02T23:26:00.000Z	moveax	bazhang	okies
2008-05-18T14:12:00.000Z	moveax	bazhang	cheers mate
