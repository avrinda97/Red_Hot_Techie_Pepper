2006-06-14T13:06:00.000Z	valierien		Tommy : whats the prob?
2006-06-14T13:06:00.000Z	valierien		rsync
2006-06-14T13:07:00.000Z	valierien		ackeubu: rsync
2006-06-14T13:08:00.000Z	Tommy2k4	valierien	any ideas?
2006-06-14T13:08:00.000Z	valierien		Tommy : try again and make notes, its not that hard
2006-06-14T13:09:00.000Z	valierien		I have had the same type of issue, I just paid attention, forget what I did differently
2006-06-14T13:09:00.000Z	Tommy2k4	valierien	its not that i forgot which was which, its that it said hda5 was 1gb and hda6 was 512mb when i specifically set them to be vice versa
2006-06-14T13:09:00.000Z	valierien		ackebu : rsynch -- its a joy
2006-06-14T13:09:00.000Z	Tommy2k4		and they were different file systems so just guessing could screw things up
2006-06-14T13:09:00.000Z	Tommy2k4		and that doesn't explain why it said i needed over 2048 when i had it set as way higher
2006-06-14T13:10:00.000Z	valierien		Tommy : assuming youre formatting them anyway, just try again
2006-06-14T13:10:00.000Z	Tommy2k4		i tried several times
2006-06-14T13:10:00.000Z	valierien		tar
2006-06-14T13:11:00.000Z	Tommy2k4		another problem with the installer is that when defining the partitions, if you click on create after creating another one without first clicking on the the free space partition the installer will go blank and you have to go back and start the partitioning again
2006-06-14T13:12:00.000Z	Tommy2k4		is it possible repartition my drive from inside ubuntu
2006-06-14T13:12:00.000Z	valierien		so, wine will work on dapper (hypothetically)
2006-06-14T13:13:00.000Z	Tommy2k4		the pc i use 24/7 is a 733mhz p3 with 256mb ram
2006-06-14T13:13:00.000Z	Tommy2k4		i have an athlon 2500+ with 1gb ram downstairs but that would mean being next to my dad all day and id rather not >_<
2006-06-14T13:14:00.000Z	valierien	pixelbunnie	: properties in the shortcut (launcher)
2006-06-14T13:14:00.000Z	Tommy2k4		how can i play music over the network from my sisters windows box
2006-06-14T13:15:00.000Z	valierien		Tommy : mount the file system
2006-06-14T13:15:00.000Z	Tommy2k4	valierien	but she would have a different ip every time she reboots
