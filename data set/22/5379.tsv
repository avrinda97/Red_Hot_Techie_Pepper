2007-05-26T05:29:00.000Z	AFaith	inflex	yes ... nothing connected to this error
2007-05-26T05:41:00.000Z	AFaith	inflex	i've spotted a problem .. maybe this is the cause why lighthttpd doesn't start
2007-05-26T05:42:00.000Z	AFaith	inflex	if you can see in the error, that something its reffering to fastcgi config : 2007-05-26 14:24:07: (configfile.c.827) source: /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled/10-fastcgi.conf line: 14 pos: 12 parser failed somehow near here: socket
2007-05-26T05:43:00.000Z	AFaith	inflex	in that /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled/10-fastcgi.conf at the socket is set to /tmp/php.socket but in /tmp there are no *socket files
2007-05-26T05:43:00.000Z	AFaith	inflex	any ideas what should i do ?
2007-05-26T05:49:00.000Z	AFaith	inflex	i've finally managed to start lighthttpd, but now i'm facing another problem
