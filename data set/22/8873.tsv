2006-07-09T15:20:00.000Z	joosep		i have a problem with dapper, it randomly reboots without any notice
2006-07-09T15:20:00.000Z	joosep		any ideas?
2006-07-09T15:20:00.000Z	cwillu	joosep	reboots in what sens?
2006-07-09T15:25:00.000Z	joosep	cwillu	just reboot
2006-07-09T15:25:00.000Z	cwillu	joosep	like, clean shutdown (shutdown screens, etc)?  or just shutdown right now like you hit the reset switch?
2006-07-09T15:26:00.000Z	joosep	cwillu	not clean
2006-07-09T15:26:00.000Z	cwillu	joosep	and it actually reboots, not just giving you a blank screen that you have to reboot from...
2006-07-09T15:27:00.000Z	cwillu	joosep	any triggers?
2006-07-09T15:27:00.000Z	cwillu	joosep	only when you leave and come back, or only while working on it?
2006-07-09T15:27:00.000Z	cwillu	joosep	i.e., I've seen some screensavers cause that type of failure (fyreworks does it to me on a couple of my machines)
2006-07-09T15:27:00.000Z	joosep	cwillu	yes it reboots, and no apparent triggers, sometimes it reboots while working on it and sometimes when it's idle
2006-07-09T15:28:00.000Z	joosep	cwillu	actually it's not my machine i'm troublehooting, it's my girlfirends so i'm pretty much blind here :P
2006-07-09T15:29:00.000Z	cwillu	joosep	have you seen it crash personally, or are you just in front of it now having not seen it yet, or thirdly are you troubleshooting verbally?  :)
2006-07-09T15:29:00.000Z	joosep	cwillu	verbally
2006-07-09T15:29:00.000Z	cwillu	joosep	so you're not in front of the machine then?  :/
2006-07-09T15:30:00.000Z	joosep	cwillu	not at the moment no. but i thought that maybe it was a common bug or smth
2006-07-09T15:30:00.000Z	cwillu	joosep	well, the specifics matter quite a bit in this case, and third party descriptions have a way of being inaccurate 90% of the time :)
2006-07-09T15:30:00.000Z	cwillu	joosep	could be anything from a hardware failure (bad power supply, etc) to a software package isse
2006-07-09T15:31:00.000Z	joosep	cwillu	ok thanks anyway :)
2006-07-09T15:31:00.000Z	cwillu	joosep	if you get on the machine, I'd look at the contents of dmesg and other stuff in /var/log
2006-07-09T15:31:00.000Z	joosep	cwillu	i suspected bad ram, cos it a quite old machine
2006-07-09T15:31:00.000Z	cwillu	joosep	I'd actually suspect the ps first
