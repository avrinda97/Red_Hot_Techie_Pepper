2010-03-08T03:15:00.000Z	bribroder		afternoon everyone
2010-03-08T03:16:00.000Z	bribroder		is anyone able to give me some info on directory structure? i'm setting up partitions for different folders and i need some guidance in sizing them, etc

2010-03-08T03:19:00.000Z	hdon	bribroder	you should know that /opt is not very different from /usr/locla
2010-03-08T03:20:00.000Z	hdon	bribroder	most of the time if something doesn't go under /usr, it will be under /usr/local, not /opt
2010-03-08T03:20:00.000Z	bribroder	hdon	it's my understanding that it's installed software, and i'd like to separate that from the root
2010-03-08T03:21:00.000Z	hdon	bribroder	well i have about a million programs installed that i compiled from source, and by default they all go under /usr/local, not /opt
2010-03-08T03:21:00.000Z	bribroder	hdon	is it possible to mount /opt and /usr to the same partition?
2010-03-08T03:22:00.000Z	hdon	bribroder	no i wasn't comparing /opt and /usr, i was comparing /opt and /usr/local

2010-03-08T03:23:00.000Z	hdon	bribroder	it depends on how long you want to keep your logs. a server needs a very large /var
2010-03-08T03:26:00.000Z	hdon	bribroder	a gig is probably plenty for your purposes then. but i'm not sure how on ubuntu to increase the log rotation frequency
2010-03-08T03:29:00.000Z	hdon	bribroder	no, but i wouldn't recommend you have more than two partitions unless you are doing it for an important system (many users on your system, or a server) or for the experience :)
2010-03-08T03:29:00.000Z	bribroder	hdon	in this case i'm doing it for the pleasure of causing myself the trouble :)
2010-03-08T03:31:00.000Z	bribroder	hdon	so should i mount /usr or /usr/local separately?
2010-03-08T03:41:00.000Z	hdon	bribroder	if you're just trying to make things complicated for yourself, you may want to check out LVM and/or UnionFS
2010-03-08T03:42:00.000Z	hdon	bribroder	LVM will allow you to do more complicated partition allocation (as well as other things) and UnionFS will allow you to do more complicated mounting (like mounting two different directories from the same filesystem at two different points)
2010-03-08T03:43:00.000Z	hdon	bribroder	UnionFS will let you do something like put /usr/local and /opt on the same filesystem partition
2010-03-08T03:43:00.000Z	hdon	bribroder	i've never done it though, only read about it
2010-03-08T03:44:00.000Z	bribroder	hdon	great info, thanks much... how much space do you think i should allocate for /usr if i mount /usr/local separately?
2010-03-08T03:45:00.000Z	hdon	bribroder	well if you use LVM i think you don't have to worry about that as much because its' easy to resize the partitions and filesystems later (well, make sure you pick a filesystem that resizes easily. lvm takes care of the partitions, but i don't think it touches the filesystems)
