2007-11-06T04:13:00.000Z	Guerra		Okay, I need some help with GRUB. I am trying to triple boot, I got it to work before, and now I need to get it to work again. My master drive is an IDE with vista and ubuntu installed, my secondary drive is an SATA with XP installed. Vista and Ubuntu boot up fine, but when I select XP from the list, it says "Error 21: Selected disk does not exist". Can anyone please help me with this issue? I would appreciate it greatly.
