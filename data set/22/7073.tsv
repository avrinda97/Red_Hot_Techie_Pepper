2007-02-18T17:11:00.000Z	prodigel		no one wants to help a poor guy with it's wlan problem  ? :)
2007-02-18T17:11:00.000Z	phaidros	prodigel	whats up?
2007-02-18T17:12:00.000Z	prodigel	phaidros	that was for you
2007-02-18T17:13:00.000Z	prodigel	phaidros	i think it's a settings problem not a driver problem
2007-02-18T17:13:00.000Z	phaidros	prodigel	you can try to use wifi-radar, which is not the most stable tool for me
2007-02-18T17:13:00.000Z	phaidros	prodigel	or just use a tereminal
2007-02-18T17:13:00.000Z	phaidros	prodigel	try iwconfig and ifconfig
2007-02-18T17:14:00.000Z	prodigel	phaidros	i've worked with iwconfig
2007-02-18T17:14:00.000Z	phaidros	prodigel	man iwconfig & man ifconfig are helping here too!
2007-02-18T17:14:00.000Z	phaidros	prodigel	ok, so what is problem in detail?
2007-02-18T17:14:00.000Z	phaidros	prodigel	iwconfig ath0 mode ad-hoc (or adhoc, depending on the model) essid youressid
2007-02-18T17:15:00.000Z	prodigel	phaidros	firstly it's seen as eth not ath
2007-02-18T17:15:00.000Z	prodigel	phaidros	but that could be because it's an usb stick
2007-02-18T17:15:00.000Z	phaidros	prodigel	yes eth0 is ok
2007-02-18T17:15:00.000Z	prodigel	phaidros	now it says access point it's invalid.
2007-02-18T17:15:00.000Z	phaidros	prodigel	can be named wifi0 wlan0 zusb0 .. as the driver implements it
2007-02-18T17:16:00.000Z	prodigel	phaidros	should i name it somehow? does it make importance?
2007-02-18T17:16:00.000Z	phaidros	prodigel	what network? adhoc network on which chanel?
2007-02-18T17:16:00.000Z	prodigel	phaidros	adhoc
2007-02-18T17:17:00.000Z	prodigel	phaidros	i want to register to talk privately. how do I register :D
2007-02-18T17:18:00.000Z	prodigel	phaidros	I don't know what settings are to be made so that adhoc will work
2007-02-18T17:19:00.000Z	phaidros	prodigel	just type "/msg NICKSERV register youpassword"  in the server window of your irc client
