2005-03-23T11:36:00.000Z	Absenth		which is it that's broken?  nv, or nvidia
2005-03-23T11:37:00.000Z	Absenth		so I can leave it alone, and pray I don't have some form of forced reboot, Ie powerfailure prior to a fix?
2005-03-23T11:38:00.000Z	Absenth		2400+ with a gig of ddr.
2005-03-23T11:38:00.000Z	Absenth		although the universe stuff might have added a bunch of time to that.
2005-03-23T11:39:00.000Z	Absenth		so where do I watch for an nVidia kernel fix?
2005-03-23T11:40:00.000Z	Absenth		shrug, if my 3d doesn't work I have more excuse for not playing games tomorow, and doing things that are productive.
2005-03-23T11:40:00.000Z	Absenth		like wash and wax my car in the snow.
2005-03-23T11:41:00.000Z	Absenth		I'd argue with both of you, but it wouldn't change either of your minds :)
2005-03-23T11:41:00.000Z	Absenth		Gentoo is cool because portage is almost ports.
2005-03-23T11:42:00.000Z	Absenth		Ubuntu is so far the linux distro that pisses me off the least.
2005-03-23T11:42:00.000Z	wuwei23	Absenth	that's how I feel about ubuntu :)
2005-03-23T11:43:00.000Z	Absenth	wuwei23	if it weren't for how bad software support is, I'd probibly be running OpenBSD everywhere.
2005-03-23T11:43:00.000Z	wuwei23	Absenth	i'm directing my angst over the loss of menu editing at gnome 2.10 though :)
2005-03-23T11:43:00.000Z	Absenth	wuwei23	heh, get SCFE
2005-03-23T11:43:00.000Z	wuwei23		absenth: have you tried OpenDarwin? it was the nicest bsd install :)
2005-03-23T11:43:00.000Z	Absenth	wuwei23	heh, get XCFE
2005-03-23T11:43:00.000Z	wuwei23		absenth: i know, i know :)
2005-03-23T11:44:00.000Z	wuwei23	Absenth	i just like the gnome look/feel :)
2005-03-23T11:44:00.000Z	Absenth		openDarwin,  Hmm.....   admit I've never heard of it, however I've got openBSD, and Darwin on my powermac :)
2005-03-23T11:44:00.000Z	Absenth		obsd running in virtual pc :)
2005-03-23T11:45:00.000Z	wuwei23	Absenth	Darwin is basically BSD, OpenDarwin is the OS offshoot of it...kinda like a slightly more groomed OpenBSD :)
2005-03-23T11:46:00.000Z	Absenth	wuwei23	more groomed openbsd eh?  nice.  now as long as they can keep the nearly 8 years is it, with 1 remote root, in the default install, I'll give it a go :)
