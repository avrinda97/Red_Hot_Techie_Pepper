2007-08-28T09:48:00.000Z	Ashfire908		how do i install two ubuntu systems on the same computer so that grub gets updated with both systems (like if the kernel gets upgraded)
2007-08-28T09:49:00.000Z	mono6	Ashfire908	it's a bit tricky...just take the entries from the last-installed OS from 'menu.lst' and copy paste them into your current grub
2007-08-28T09:49:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mono6	there's no automatic way of doing it?
2007-08-28T09:50:00.000Z	mono6	Ashfire908	not that i am aware of, because the install will overwrite your current bootloader. some distros will include older recognized entires
2007-08-28T09:53:00.000Z	mono6	Ashfire908	I would consider Automatix to be "beta". it does a lot of automated tasks, like "YasT" in SusE
2007-08-28T09:53:00.000Z	mono6	Ashfire908	the beauty of Linux is the transparency and tools like Automatix take some of the control away from you
2007-08-28T09:58:00.000Z	mono6	Ashfire908	sure what's your question?
2007-08-28T09:58:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mono6	could you help me understand https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto#head-44a5805eeda20ec1b6bd6c274cbf3a74230675d1
2007-08-28T09:59:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mono6	it's not worded too well and even though i'm learning alot (like how to use a CLI to do stuff and commands like ifdown) but i just don't understand
2007-08-28T10:00:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mono6	sorry i'm in the middle of a alternate CLI system install and i'm at the grub part
2007-08-28T10:00:00.000Z	mono6	Ashfire908	np
2007-08-28T10:02:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mono6	you forgot the install part
2007-08-28T10:03:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mono6	you put  apt-get ndiswrapper
2007-08-28T10:05:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mono6	in the grub wiki page, what it talking about symlinks? i know what symbolic links are but i have no clue what that does
2007-08-28T10:05:00.000Z	mono6	Ashfire908	i never used symlinks with grub
2007-08-28T10:06:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mono6	what they are trying to do
2007-08-28T10:06:00.000Z	mono6	Ashfire908	grub is really pretty simple...you have ONE master grub that you use and you just add entries to menu.lst and that's it
2007-08-28T10:07:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mono6	i'm not too comfortable messing with it
2007-08-28T10:07:00.000Z	mono6	Ashfire908	after that re-install with grub-install /dev/hda (or wherever you have your bootloade)
2007-08-28T10:07:00.000Z	mono6	Ashfire908	you cannot break it, really...if it fails you can use the install disk
2007-08-28T10:08:00.000Z	mono6	Ashfire908	Boot the Live CD...mount your /boot partition, do a chroot and a grub-install
2007-08-28T10:09:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mono6	the system it's on (a server) doesn't like livecds and dumps me onto the command line
