2004-11-03T15:37:00.000Z	linux_galore		yeah sounds like a script conflict maybe there is a version variation
2004-11-03T15:38:00.000Z	linux_galore		hmm beer
2004-11-03T15:39:00.000Z	linux_galore		someone told me there was a fus over images used with ubuntu being pornographic.. I looked for ages and didnt find anything on my image...now Im like "Ive been ripped off" were my pr0n images lol
2004-11-03T15:41:00.000Z	linux_galore		what porn images I didnt find any...and if those or pr0n sheesh you guys should see more billboards
2004-11-03T15:41:00.000Z	linux_galore		are*
2004-11-03T15:41:00.000Z	Kamion	linux_galore	the discussion is basically over, because we made the images no longer default
2004-11-03T15:42:00.000Z	linux_galore	Kamion	sounds like the americans have invaded
2004-11-03T15:42:00.000Z	Kamion	linux_galore	not really, only a fraction of the negative opinions were from Americans.
2004-12-25T17:20:00.000Z	linux_galore	Kamion	yeah but your not going to have apache mysql and php and a few mail server options squished into that single CD
2004-12-25T17:22:00.000Z	Kamion	linux_galore	sure, but that's ok, you can get them from the network totally trivially. people installing servers will be picking their own package sets anyway.
2004-12-25T17:23:00.000Z	linux_galore	Kamion	I can do that with Novell too but II dont get the Enterprise server rig for that reason i get it because everything on the CD works together very well
2004-12-25T17:25:00.000Z	linux_galore	Kamion	 I dont want a desktop Ive already done that....now I want a dedicated server solution
2004-12-25T17:25:00.000Z	Kamion	linux_galore	I wasn't contradicting that in the slightest
2004-12-25T17:25:00.000Z	linux_galore	Kamion	as soon as the customer install either red hat or Novell guess whats happens........both of those companies will throw in a 12 month desktop install for free....bye bye Ubuntu
2004-12-25T17:26:00.000Z	Kamion	linux_galore	our releases are all supported for 18 months and we'll be doing longer-term support options too.
2004-12-25T17:26:00.000Z	linux_galore	Kamion	you can do that with any distro.....you miss the logic of having a distro
2004-12-25T17:26:00.000Z	Kamion	linux_galore	as a distribution developer, I respectfully disagree :-)
2004-12-25T17:27:00.000Z	linux_galore	Kamion	using your logic I may aswell go grab Debian because im getting the same thing anyway
2004-12-25T17:28:00.000Z	Kamion	linux_galore	you don't get security support over three release cycles with Debian
2004-12-25T17:34:00.000Z	linux_galore	Kamion	you mean lazy as in "doesnt chew up time"
2004-12-25T17:34:00.000Z	Kamion	linux_galore	like it or not customers want to install stuff not on the CD, so any sane distro will integrate that stuff too
2004-12-25T17:35:00.000Z	linux_galore	Kamion	yes but I dont want to work around a "desktop" CD to install a server....i want a server CD for servers
