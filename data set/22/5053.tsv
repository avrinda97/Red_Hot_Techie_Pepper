2009-03-27T20:23:00.000Z	murlidhar	LjL	how to set the default file-manager when i have multiple file-managers ?
2009-03-27T20:24:00.000Z	murlidhar	LjL	any idea ?
2009-03-27T20:24:00.000Z	LjL	murlidhar	you need to change the "inode/directory" and "inode/system_directory" filetypes, but i'm a KDE user so i don't know how that's done from GNOME
2009-03-27T20:24:00.000Z	murlidhar	LjL	as far as i remember it can be set using update-alternatives
2009-03-27T20:25:00.000Z	murlidhar	LjL	also i am not using gnome or kde ... just openbox
2009-03-27T20:25:00.000Z	LjL	murlidhar	i have no idea, but i doubt it can be done with update-alternatives honestly
2009-03-27T20:26:00.000Z	murlidhar	LjL	hmm okies i actually forgot the exact command cuz i remember doing it for hardy
