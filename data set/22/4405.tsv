2011-10-15T18:04:00.000Z	tito_		I'm in trouble. can anyone please help me? :(
2011-10-15T18:05:00.000Z	tito_		I upgraded to oneiric yesterday and didnt get the lightdm. So I installed lightdm and unity greeter manually and removed gdm. lightdm now works but all unity icons are now the old gnome icons and the whole thing has a windows 98 look (I'm totally new here, so I cant say technical terms)
2011-10-15T18:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tito_	have you tried changing icon set?
2011-10-15T18:08:00.000Z	tito_	ActionParsnip	How do I change the icon set? I don't know anything. as I said, I'm totally new :(
2011-10-15T18:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tito_	in display properties
2011-10-15T18:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tito_	grab a new icon set and open appearence settings from dash, then apply the icons there
2011-10-15T18:17:00.000Z	tito_	ActionParsnip	ok
2011-10-15T18:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tito_	there is Faenza icon theme which seems popular :)
2011-10-15T18:18:00.000Z	tito_	ActionParsnip	thanx :) trying that :)
2011-10-15T18:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tito_	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tiheum/equinox; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get -y install faenza-icon-theme
2011-10-15T18:19:00.000Z	tito_	ActionParsnip	thanx a lot :D
2011-10-15T18:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tito_	you'll still need to set the theme in display properties
2011-10-15T18:20:00.000Z	tito_	ActionParsnip	ok
2011-10-15T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tito_	you may need to log off and on to apply all icons
2011-10-15T18:22:00.000Z	tito_	ActionParsnip	I tried, only the icon set is changing but it is still the classic GNOME (grey) look :(
2011-10-15T18:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tito_	try logging off and on
2011-10-15T18:23:00.000Z	tito_	ActionParsnip	ok. be right back then.
2011-10-15T18:43:00.000Z	tito_	ActionParsnip	I installed faenza with gnome tweak tool. And now I realize the main problem with my system is it doesnt have a shell theme. What do I do? :P
2011-10-15T18:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tito_	do you mean gnome shell?
2011-10-15T18:45:00.000Z	tito_	ActionParsnip	gnome tweak shows there is "shell theme" installed. both gnome shell and unity look like windows 98 :/
2011-10-15T18:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tito_	i use neither, sorry
2011-10-17T18:22:00.000Z	tito_	ActionParsnip	do you know how to install the java plugin in firefox?
