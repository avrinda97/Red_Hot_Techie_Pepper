2010-03-27T00:36:00.000Z	alonea		is there anything better than ndiswrapper? I get DC'd a lot and have trouble connecting to WPA2. It connects to unsecured fine, but we are not allowed to use that here.
2010-03-27T00:38:00.000Z	alonea		its an Atheros card
2010-03-27T00:39:00.000Z	AbortD	alonea	whats the problem with your atheros card?
2010-03-27T00:40:00.000Z	alonea	AbortD	Well, since its one of the newer ones I had to ndiswrapper it, but its very unstable with wpa2. I have a lot of trouble connecting, get dc'd a lot, and eventually it wont let me connect again until I restart computer.
2010-03-27T00:40:00.000Z	AbortD	alonea	undo the ndiswrapper and i will show you how to get it working
2010-03-27T00:42:00.000Z	alonea	AbortD	since I am kinda on that wifi atm, I will undo it after I know what to do next. ^_^
2010-03-27T00:42:00.000Z	AbortD	alonea	try this and tell me if it works linux-backports-modules-karmic-generic
2010-03-27T00:42:00.000Z	AbortD	alonea	i just bought my laptop and it has a atheros card
2010-03-27T00:42:00.000Z	alonea	AbortD	Yeah, I got this 2 weeks ago
2010-03-27T00:44:00.000Z	alonea	AbortD	will undo the ndiswrapper shortly and see if that works instead.
2010-03-27T00:45:00.000Z	AbortD	alonea	i can almost guarantee it will i had the exact same problem
2010-03-27T00:46:00.000Z	alonea	AbortD	and I wont use Ndiswrapper at all correct?
2010-03-27T00:48:00.000Z	AbortD	alonea	system monitor?
2010-03-27T00:48:00.000Z	alonea	AbortD	yeah, I guess its called that
2010-03-27T00:50:00.000Z	alonea	AbortD	no, the thing that lists stuff that you can kill. Or was that app KDE only?

2010-03-27T00:50:00.000Z	alonea	AbortD	I can't see it I guess. I have an application that is stuck on my screen
2010-03-27T00:51:00.000Z	AbortD	alonea	open terminal and type xkill
2010-03-27T00:52:00.000Z	alonea	AbortD	THankyou!
