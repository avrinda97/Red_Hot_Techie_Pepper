2012-10-19T11:02:00.000Z	akis	DaemonicApathy	the newest. 12.04.
2012-10-19T11:04:00.000Z	akis	DaemonicApathy	the newest. 12.04. any comment?
2012-10-19T11:05:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	akis	The newest is now 12.10, but with 12.04 I was expecting an easier time. Sorry, I don't know.
2012-10-19T11:05:00.000Z	akis	DaemonicApathy	ok i meant the newest LTS.
2012-10-19T11:06:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	akis	fair enough
2012-10-19T11:06:00.000Z	akis	DaemonicApathy	what do you mean?
2012-10-19T11:09:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	akis	You might try 'nvidia-xconfig' and restart the x-server. Otherwise, my best guess would be to run Ubuntu until it works, then install xfce on top.
2012-10-19T11:10:00.000Z	akis	DaemonicApathy	do i have to run nvidia-xconfig i a terminal or is there any gui application?
2012-10-19T11:13:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	akis	Terminal
2012-10-19T11:14:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	akis	I honestly do not know.
2012-10-19T11:26:00.000Z	akis	DaemonicApathy	i run nvidia-xconfig i a terminal and i got command not found. i suppose that nvidia driver is not installed.  is that possible?
2012-10-19T11:27:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	akis	Potentially. Do you have anything listed in System Settings > Additional Drivers?
2012-10-19T11:34:00.000Z	akis	DaemonicApathy	experimental nvdia, nvidia accelerated graphics driver v. 173, nvidia accelerated graphics driver v. 17-updates, nvidia accelerated graphics version current (recommended), nvidia accelerated graphics post release updates/version current-updates, nvidia accelerated graphics driver **experimental** beta/version experimental-304. On one is activated!!!
2012-10-19T11:35:00.000Z	akis	DaemonicApathy	misstype. No one is activated.
2012-10-19T11:39:00.000Z	akis	DaemonicApathy	ok thanks. that's the point.
2012-10-19T11:40:00.000Z	akis	DaemonicApathy	in case that the systme cannot restart, what can i do to login to disable my choise?
2012-10-19T11:40:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	akis	That is a good question, and well thought-out. I hope someone here knows how to disable video drivers from the command line, because it's much too late for me to remember.
2012-10-19T11:42:00.000Z	akis	DaemonicApathy	-:). too late because of your locale time or because of your age?!
2012-10-19T11:42:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	akis	time ;-)
2012-10-19T11:43:00.000Z	akis	DaemonicApathy	yea -:). any way thanks.
2012-10-19T11:58:00.000Z	akis	DaemonicApathy	i installed the recommended version of nvidia driver and the systme works fine. in ubuntu 12.04 was pre-installed because of Unity. it has details in driver description. in xubuntu doens need 3d graphics and that the reason that it wasnt preinstalled. but it had this issue. now everything is OK> thanks again!
