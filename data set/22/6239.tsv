2006-11-24T14:00:00.000Z	Jager-		H4g3m0n: Ive tried down to 4gb
2006-11-24T14:02:00.000Z	Jager-		Okay.. yea Ive suspected that.. my hdd is pretty badly fragmented..
2006-11-24T14:03:00.000Z	Jager-		*sigh* defragging takes HOURS :'(
2006-11-24T14:04:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Jager-	what are you defragging, and why?
2006-11-24T14:04:00.000Z	Jager-	nolimitsoya	Aparently that will fix the problem Im having resizing my qwindows partition
2006-11-24T14:04:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Jager-	the only linux fs i know ofthat has a defragger would be xfs, and that defragger is both fast and effecient
2006-11-24T14:05:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Jager-	aha, well, defragging ntfs is painfull :)
2006-11-24T14:05:00.000Z	Jager-	nolimitsoya	Im on widows defragging.. so that I can resize it using Gpart
2006-11-24T14:05:00.000Z	Jager-	nolimitsoya	lol yes
2006-11-24T14:06:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Jager-	check out dirms & buzzsaw. its a free defragger that get the job done in the background, and defrags in a (very thorough) way that reduces future fragmentation
2006-11-24T14:06:00.000Z	Jager-	nolimitsoya	windows apps?
2006-11-24T14:07:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Jager-	it might also be quite a bit faster, if you use the "ugly" (=almost as any other defragger, but slightly better) defrag option, and yes its a windows app :)
2006-11-24T14:08:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Jager-	dirms is a defrager, and buzzsaw is a background realtime defragtool making sure you never have to bother with defraging again
2006-11-24T14:09:00.000Z	Jager-	nolimitsoya	Awesome! Thanks :)
2006-11-24T14:30:00.000Z	Jager-	nolimitsoya	does dirMS usually perform faster than the windows defragger?
2006-11-24T14:31:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Jager-	in my experience, yes
2006-11-24T14:32:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Jager-	unless you do the thorough defragmentation... that takes ages, but reduces future fragmentation a great deal
2006-11-24T14:34:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Jager-	yes it is. you register for free, but have to renew the registration every month unless you pay a small fee
