2008-03-08T09:37:00.000Z	livefoniks	Bradley	 Did you just install Ubuntu?  And have you done your updates yet?
2008-03-08T09:38:00.000Z	Bradley	livefoniks	yes i just installed the newest version but i dont know how 2 update
2008-03-08T09:40:00.000Z	livefoniks	Bradley	 Get all your updates first...then the instructions for installing the latest ATI drivers can be found here:  http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Gutsy_Installation_Guide
2008-03-08T09:41:00.000Z	livefoniks	Bradley	 My advice would be to NOT use the restricted drivers manager, as it holds an outdated version of the ATI driver...you'd need to install XGL to make anything work, and that's a mess.
2008-03-08T09:42:00.000Z	Bradley	livefoniks	how do i get the latest updates
2008-03-08T09:42:00.000Z	Bradley	livefoniks	what do to get the driver installed, i have downloaded it from the site
2008-03-08T09:44:00.000Z	Bradley	livefoniks	how do i get the latest drivers, and get everything working correctly
2008-03-08T09:44:00.000Z	livefoniks	Bradley	grab all your system updates first, before installing the new driver.  Open a terminal and type in "sudo apt-get update", no quotes...it'll prompt you for your password, then refresh your repository info.
2008-03-08T09:44:00.000Z	Bradley	livefoniks	ok, this is prob. noob but where is the terminal
2008-03-08T09:45:00.000Z	livefoniks	Bradley	 Applications/Accessories/Terminal
2008-03-08T09:46:00.000Z	Bradley	livefoniks	okay, after that what do i do?
2008-03-08T09:47:00.000Z	livefoniks	Bradley	 Go to System/Administration/Update Manager...open that and follow the prompts.
2008-03-08T09:48:00.000Z	Bradley	livefoniks	it just says download 6 files, says something else than finishes
2008-03-08T09:49:00.000Z	Bradley	livefoniks	what now man, i did the updates
