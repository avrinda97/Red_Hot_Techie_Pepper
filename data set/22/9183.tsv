2005-02-10T10:08:00.000Z	ubernoob		I just upgraded to Horay, but now x-screen won't start! :(
2005-02-10T10:09:00.000Z	ubernoob		anyone that have the same problem?
2005-02-10T10:09:00.000Z	trey3	ubernoob	ensure 'xserver-xorg' is installed
2005-02-10T10:10:00.000Z	trey3	ubernoob	also 'xorg-common'  (I think thats what its called)
2005-02-10T10:10:00.000Z	trey3	ubernoob	'dpkg -l' the packages I stated...
2005-02-10T10:11:00.000Z	ubernoob	trey3	i have xserver-xorg, i'll reboot soon and check the other
2005-02-10T10:11:00.000Z	trey3	ubernoob	uhh?
2005-02-10T10:11:00.000Z	trey3	ubernoob	bah
2005-02-10T10:12:00.000Z	trey3	ubernoob	most xfree > xorg problems are due to not dist-upgrade'ing though... (only upgrade'ing won't bring the packages you need for xorg)
2005-02-10T10:13:00.000Z	ubernoob	trey3	yeah... that might be it
2005-02-10T10:14:00.000Z	trey3	ubernoob	you attempted via synaptic? did you choose "smart upgrade"?  (smart upgrade = dist-upgrade)
2005-02-10T10:15:00.000Z	ubernoob	trey3	i used synaptic, but i have saved my answer from before, so i'm not sure what i did
2005-02-10T10:16:00.000Z	trey3	ubernoob	alright  :)
2005-02-10T10:26:00.000Z	ubernoob	trey3	it didn't help i had done dist-upgrade, and had the packages installed to
2005-02-10T10:26:00.000Z	trey3	ubernoob	what errors you get?
2005-02-10T10:28:00.000Z	trey3	ubernoob	umm... that means X is loading... you wait?
2005-02-10T10:29:00.000Z	trey3	ubernoob	shouldn't take insanely long...
2005-02-10T10:29:00.000Z	trey3	ubernoob	at the very least, it should kill X if something is wrong...
2005-02-10T10:30:00.000Z	ubernoob	trey3	how can i kill it manually? i tried ctrl+alt+backspace whitout luck
2005-02-10T10:30:00.000Z	trey3	ubernoob	/var/log/Xorg.0.log would be the log file  :)
2005-02-10T10:30:00.000Z	trey3	ubernoob	you can't... until you at least get a curser...
2005-02-10T11:35:00.000Z	ubernoob	trey3	i tried to wait, but it didnt help. and there isn't any xorg.log file. only xfree
