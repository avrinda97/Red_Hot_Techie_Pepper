2009-04-05T21:39:00.000Z	mgco		anyhow, has anyone experienced viral infections (boot sector) with hardy heron? [i don't use dual boot, meaning i have Linux as my only OS]
2009-04-05T21:41:00.000Z	aar	mgco	never heard of any cases with linux
2009-04-05T21:44:00.000Z	mgco	aar	same here. up until now. that's why i'm asking. and of course linux's reputation on the line -- i've tried convincing my friends to switch to ubuntu since i've left windoze last year, and now ubuntu itself is easily infected without a solution at hand??? not good, not good at all.
2009-04-05T21:45:00.000Z	aar	mgco	what is the infection? what did you use to detect it?
2009-04-05T21:46:00.000Z	mgco	aar	the infection was detected by bios (tvac something... trendmicro)
2009-04-05T21:47:00.000Z	aar	mgco	bios is a small bit of software used to boot your machine. it cannot detect an infection by itself.
2009-04-05T21:50:00.000Z	mgco	aar	bios or cmos, it's what runs before grub shows
2009-04-05T21:52:00.000Z	aar	mgco	correct, and it is impossible to detect an infection using your bios. what i was wondering is: what is the name of the virus you say you have? what antivirus software did you use to detect it? and when did you become aware you had it?
2009-04-05T22:00:00.000Z	mgco	aar	i'm getting a different message now: to boot from another floppy disk, replace the infected..... gibberish
2009-04-05T22:00:00.000Z	mgco	aar	trendmicro from the cmos startup
2009-04-05T22:03:00.000Z	aar	mgco	i've never come across anything of the sort (and I still can't quite understand how your PC can detect an infection even before botting into a system). anyway, if you're really concerned, wipe the hard drive and start from scratch. you might want to get someone to have a look at it first though (in case it can be saved).
2009-04-05T22:04:00.000Z	mgco	aar	i guess it's called "boot virus detection" on one's cmos
2009-04-05T22:05:00.000Z	aar	mgco	bot virus detection is a misnomer. will just stop anything writing to the boot sector, virus or not. It's not a virus scanner in reality.
2009-04-05T22:37:00.000Z	aar	mgco	nobody seems to know what you've got, so it's hard to draw any conclusions. I would recommend you burn yourself a clamav livecd (https://launchpad.net/clamav-livecd), scan your system, and get back to us with the results for advice (i.e. give us the precise name of the infection and the location)
2009-04-05T22:45:00.000Z	aar	mgco	did you read my advice about scanning your system with clamav livecd and telling us what your problem is precisely?
2009-04-05T22:45:00.000Z	aar	mgco	if you want to recover files, a livecd is also the way forward
2009-04-05T22:46:00.000Z	mgco	aar	unfortunately i can't move forward with that. my cmos doesn't show an option to boot from USB-Optical
2009-04-05T22:47:00.000Z	mgco	aar	oops sorry wrong reply ---  i don't have a liveCD for clamav, do they ship free CDs for those as well?
2009-04-05T22:47:00.000Z	aar	mgco	just download the image from the URL i gave you
2009-04-05T22:54:00.000Z	mgco	aar	i'm at the website "No download files exist for this project." :'-(
2009-04-05T22:56:00.000Z	mgco	aar	i'm really sleepy now, i'll take your advice and see if i can have that clamav livecd run. i just don't know how yet.
2009-04-05T22:57:00.000Z	aar	mgco	good luck
