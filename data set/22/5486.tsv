2007-04-26T13:15:00.000Z	GuHHH		hello
2007-04-26T13:16:00.000Z	GuHHH		need some help, i can load my xserver but i cant run the ubuntu but only on recovery mode, because the screen goes black when ubuntu logo must appears, how do i edit the options to donot load the graphical interface on loading or how i edit the graphic options?
2007-04-26T13:18:00.000Z	eck	GuHHH	you should switch to a console (ctrl-alt-f1 if it doesn't do so after loading X fails) and then troubleshoot from there
2007-04-26T13:20:00.000Z	GuHHH	eck	i cant, the keyboard doesnt function, it starts to blink
2007-04-26T13:22:00.000Z	eck	GuHHH	you can create an inittab file and set the runlevel to < 5 there
2007-04-26T13:22:00.000Z	eck	GuHHH	e.g. set it to 3
2007-04-26T13:23:00.000Z	GuHHH	eck	dont u know anyway to make the boot without gui?
2007-04-26T13:23:00.000Z	eck	GuHHH	yes, you need to change inittab so X doesn't start
2007-04-26T13:24:00.000Z	GuHHH	eck	okay, i will see that, thanks
2007-04-26T13:28:00.000Z	GuHHH	eck	where is inittab located? couldnt find it.
2007-04-26T13:28:00.000Z	eck	GuHHH	you need to create it, it should be /etc/inittab
2007-04-26T13:29:00.000Z	eck	GuHHH	just put in a line like id:3:initdefault:
2007-04-26T13:29:00.000Z	GuHHH	eck	hehe, i noticed, i could find it on my debian partition but not on ubuntu :P
2007-04-26T13:29:00.000Z	eck	GuHHH	yeah, it is deprecated starting with upstart, but upstart will still check if it exists and if it does use it to set the default run level
2007-04-26T13:30:00.000Z	GuHHH	eck	what if i copy it from debian? any problem?
2007-04-26T13:30:00.000Z	eck	GuHHH	i think it will be fine, but you just need the initdefault line
2007-04-26T13:31:00.000Z	GuHHH	eck	thanks :)
2007-04-26T13:38:00.000Z	eck	GuHHH	there is a boot.iso for network install that is ~8MB
2007-04-26T13:38:00.000Z	GuHHH	eck	if its for network install does it means lan install? or fully installed by apt?
2007-04-26T13:39:00.000Z	eck	GuHHH	it is the same as the debian network install, which uses apt
2007-04-26T13:40:00.000Z	GuHHH	eck	so he must not have any problem installing from apt :P
2007-04-26T13:40:00.000Z	eck	GuHHH	yeah, but if you look at how it is done, it is done in a bunch of stages, so you'd have to do it like that, i don't think it is as simple as just issuing a single apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
