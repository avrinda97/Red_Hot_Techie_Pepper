2006-05-21T12:30:00.000Z	vOmpatti		Hello
2006-05-21T12:32:00.000Z	vOmpatti		mm
2006-05-21T12:32:00.000Z	vOmpatti		Could anyone tell me which ati drivers work on ubuntu :D
2006-05-21T12:32:00.000Z	vOmpatti		Im a noobie so.
2006-05-21T12:33:00.000Z	soundray	vOmpatti	look out for a message that ubotu sent you
2006-05-21T12:35:00.000Z	vOmpatti	soundray	could you tell me that should i even install ubuntu of any distr. if i have ati's card ? :s cause many people say that its not so clever.
2006-05-21T12:36:00.000Z	soundray	vOmpatti	ubuntu is as good with ATI as any other distribution, I'd say.
2006-05-21T12:37:00.000Z	vOmpatti	soundray	but is it ok for me to install ubuntu with ati's card ? :D
2006-05-21T12:37:00.000Z	soundray	vOmpatti	ATI isn't exactly the most supportive company with regard to free driver development, which is why they have a certain reputation
2006-05-21T12:37:00.000Z	soundray	vOmpatti	but you will probably be just fine.
2006-05-21T12:38:00.000Z	soundray	vOmpatti	what card have you got?
2006-05-21T12:38:00.000Z	soundray	vOmpatti	do you need 3D acceleration?
2006-05-21T12:39:00.000Z	soundray	vOmpatti	in that case you should probably install the fglrx drivers once you're set up.
2006-05-21T12:40:00.000Z	soundray	vOmpatti	for basic desktop use, Ubuntu will work out of the box with your card.
2006-05-21T12:41:00.000Z	vOmpatti	soundray	mm okay. I think im gonna come back here to whine about those after i've got it set up :] 
2006-05-21T12:41:00.000Z	soundray	vOmpatti	are you installing for the first time?
2006-05-21T12:49:00.000Z	vOmpatti	soundray	no im not :) i've had few distrobutions
2006-05-21T12:50:00.000Z	soundray	vOmpatti	ubuntu installation is fairly easy. Just stay away from the LVM option.
2006-05-21T12:52:00.000Z	vOmpatti	soundray	next question. Is it hard to get tahoma and such fonts work ? :D truetype i mean
2006-05-21T12:53:00.000Z	soundray	vOmpatti	very easy, you just have to install the msttcorefonts package:
2006-05-22T09:32:00.000Z	vOmpatti	soundray	gzip: stdin: unexpected end of file
2006-05-22T09:34:00.000Z	soundray	vOmpatti	what command are you entering?
