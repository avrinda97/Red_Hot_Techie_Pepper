2010-07-07T09:01:00.000Z	gasull		So my just-installed Ubuntu 10.04 shows a blank screen instead of running X.  If I enter in rescue mode in the grub menu and then FailSafeX, then it works.  What should I do now to have a working X Windows by default when I boot?  Thank you.
2010-07-07T09:02:00.000Z	thune3	gasull	what is your graphics chip/board?
2010-07-07T09:02:00.000Z	gasull	thune3	 I don't know.  How can I find it?
2010-07-07T09:03:00.000Z	thune3	gasull	lspci | grep VGA
2010-07-07T09:09:00.000Z	gasull	thune3	pdk: $ lspci | grep VGA
2010-07-07T09:10:00.000Z	thune3	gasull	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/Lucidi8xxFreezes you have 855 which is problematic in lucid. The new fix at the top looks proming though.
2010-07-07T09:12:00.000Z	gasull	thune3	thank youu
2010-07-07T09:13:00.000Z	thune3	gasull	the workaround is to add "i915.modeset=1" to grub line, but crashes still seem to happen without the "potential solution
2010-07-07T09:18:00.000Z	gasull	thune3	shouldn't I try the potential solution with the PPA packages first?
2010-07-07T09:21:00.000Z	thune3	gasull	sure, but you may need to used add  "i915.modeset=1" to grub (holding shift and adding on a single boot) just to get in enough to proceed with the fix. I personally would head straight for the fix.
2010-07-07T09:23:00.000Z	gasull	thune3	adding the Intel driver repo worked.  Now I'm confused about adding the 855gm PPA too or not.  Why should I?  Or should not?  Also, should I use the Workaround A anyway?
2010-07-07T09:26:00.000Z	thune3	gasull	because i get the impression that the first driver is just one with the KMS enabled ("i915.modeset=1"), and the second one actaully has the patches that fix the problems. [The workaround KMS/modeset/first-driver will get things working OK, but people experience crashes and random problems even still]
2010-07-07T09:29:00.000Z	gasull	thune3	OK. So your advise is 1st driver + 2nd driver + workaround A, right?
2010-07-07T09:30:00.000Z	thune3	gasull	No. The total solution is just the section "Potential Solution: PPA packages".
2010-07-07T09:31:00.000Z	thune3	gasull	before that section was added, workaround A was the best solution. It does not sound like you have applied or need to apply the workaounds at all.
2010-07-07T09:32:00.000Z	gasull	thune3	 Ok, thanks.
2010-07-07T09:32:00.000Z	thune3	gasull	in fact, for "Potential Solution: PPA packages" to work, the workaround must be UNDONE.
2010-07-07T09:32:00.000Z	gasull	thune3	Crystal clear now :-)
2010-08-18T02:38:00.000Z	thune3	gasull	i think you need to add rule using ufw syntax, that way when ufw rewrites your iptables it will be there.
2010-08-18T02:41:00.000Z	gasull	thune3	thanks, I 'll try to rewrite it
2010-08-18T02:43:00.000Z	gasull	thune3	aeon-ltd, it seems you cannot write a DROP rule with ufw.
2010-08-18T02:44:00.000Z	gasull	thune3	aeon-ltd, that iptables rule I'm trying avoids traffic shaping, BTW
