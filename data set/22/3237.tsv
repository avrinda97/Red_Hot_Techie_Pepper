2008-12-15T14:58:00.000Z	Saga_		I'm following this tutorial -- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedFilesystemLVMHowto -- However, I'm stick at (sudo mobprobe aes-i586) -- It say FATAL:  Module aes_i586 not found.  Any suggestions?
2008-12-15T14:59:00.000Z	jtaji	Saga_	hmm that's completely unnecessary, latest ubuntu version supported encrypted lvm from the alternate cd
2008-12-15T15:00:00.000Z	Saga_	jtaji	Will check into it.
2008-12-15T15:01:00.000Z	jtaji	Saga_	they cover the process here http://learninginlinux.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/installing-ubuntu-804-with-full-disk-encryption/
2008-12-15T15:04:00.000Z	Saga_	jtaji	Thank you so much.   I'm downloading the ISO now. :)
2008-12-15T15:04:00.000Z	jtaji	Saga_	I used it on my laptop, it's very easy :)
2008-12-15T15:05:00.000Z	Saga_	jtaji	Just wondering -- Would configuring LVM mess up the Ubuntu, especially when it's encrypted?
2008-12-15T15:06:00.000Z	Saga_	jtaji	Expanding // Shrinking size, that is.  Have you tried this yet? >_>
2008-12-15T15:06:00.000Z	jtaji	Saga_	no you can do that stuff on the fly, lvm is very convenient, I use it on most of my installs now
2008-12-15T15:07:00.000Z	jtaji	Saga_	best bet is to keep the logical volumes smaller for now and leave a bunch of free space to expand as necessary later
2008-12-15T15:07:00.000Z	jtaji	Saga_	even if you're doing one big / partition, leave a bit of space for another one or for snapshot backups
2008-12-15T15:10:00.000Z	Saga_	jtaji	-- Originally I was going to use this (PC) for media center -- but Mythubuntu's GUI seems sloppy right now.  So I wanted to install LVM / Encrpyted and I'm not going to resize it though.  Making one partition for Home/Boot then another partition for media.  I don't think I'll need snapshot backups tho.
2008-12-15T15:12:00.000Z	Saga_	jtaji	But I thought of something -- I should be using this on my laptop in first place --- It's my main system. It's in ext3 and the link you gave me -- very good points for using encrypted LVM in first place. :<
2008-12-15T15:12:00.000Z	jtaji	Saga_	/boot needs to be a small separate non lvm partition
2008-12-15T15:24:00.000Z	Saga_	jtaji	You seems to know a lot about LVM + Luks so I'm asking you something else if you're still there.  My buddy whom use Gentoo set up 3 encrypted HDDS on my computer long ago.  Too much so I moved down to Ubuntu.  How do I display encryption information on my HDDs as long as it's mounted?
2008-12-15T15:26:00.000Z	jtaji	Saga_	I've only really resized a few times :p
2008-12-15T15:26:00.000Z	Saga_	jtaji	I was speaking of... encryption issue.  I wanted to know what kind of encryption are being used on the HDD.  Or do you use a laptop, but no computer?
2008-12-15T15:27:00.000Z	jtaji	Saga_	I use both, and only encrypt the laptop... no idea on the details
2008-12-15T15:28:00.000Z	Saga_	jtaji	I mean.. I use lvdisplay -C... it shows me LV VG Attr, LSize, etc, but nothing about encryption... so I'm looking for commands to display.  Etc.  Got it. ;)
2008-12-15T15:48:00.000Z	Saga_	jtaji	Just wondering.  After installing laptop, do you unlock partiion first, then run Ubuntu, or will it boot up as normal, but only that it's encrypted instead?
2008-12-15T15:49:00.000Z	Saga_	jtaji	Finally... I'm almost done downloading... I chose a shitty server -- 98% now.
2008-12-15T16:38:00.000Z	Saga_	jtaji	You there?
