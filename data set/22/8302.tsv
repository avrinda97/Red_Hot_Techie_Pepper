2007-01-28T15:50:00.000Z	shmeelAway		what's the command to delete somehting in /usr/bin? got something else to delete, i will remember this time!
2007-01-28T15:51:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	er, what are you deleting?
2007-01-28T15:52:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	you should remove the package, instead of deleting things manually
2007-01-28T15:52:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	which package?
2007-01-28T15:53:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	which file exactly?
2007-01-28T15:54:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	and, `dpkg -l | grep qemu` doesn't return anything?
2007-01-28T16:03:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	if it were the windows version, it wouldn't be there.
2007-01-28T16:04:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	`dpkg -l | grep qemu` doesn't return anything?
2007-01-28T16:04:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	that's in your home dir.  ~/.wine/drive_c/
2007-01-28T16:05:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	very odd.  That really shouldn't still be there, unless you were playing around with other installation methods.  Anyway, sudo rm /usr/bin/qemu will do it.
2007-01-28T16:07:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	what are you using to 'see' that it's there?
2007-01-28T16:07:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	Ah.  Hit ... uh, f5?  Look for reload in the menus
2007-01-28T16:08:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	nautilus doesn't refresh stuff right away.  You were seeing a ghost ;)
2007-01-30T07:36:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	ubuntu doesn't use the root account, we use sudo.
2007-01-30T07:46:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	just console - sudo nano /file/path/stuff
2007-02-09T06:58:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	you don't want to run things at root.
2007-02-09T06:59:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	use `sudo -i` to open a root prompt
2007-02-09T07:00:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	but, you shouldn't be manually changing permissions on external harddrives.  You should be mounting them more appropriately
2007-02-09T07:55:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	"sudo commands"  don't exist.  Running as root is the same thing as prepending sudo.  Sudo just runs the commands as root.
2007-02-09T07:56:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	to run as root, you STILL need to know the commands.  It's absolutely NO different.
2007-03-29T13:45:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	sudo, or gksudo if it's a graphical program
2007-03-29T13:46:00.000Z	Flannel	shmeelAway	oh, look at that.  Jowi beat me to it... using identical text.
