2012-08-04T19:29:00.000Z	JavaKid		hello everyone
2012-08-04T19:30:00.000Z	JavaKid		I'm very new to Ubuntu and am having some trouble. Could anyone lend me a hand please?
2012-08-04T19:30:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 just ask and see))
2012-08-04T19:32:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 you don't have root permission?
2012-08-04T19:34:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 When you need to elevate permission start the command with sudo , but you should know what you're doing isn't dangerous as you can mess up your system
2012-08-04T19:35:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 .... you can install java from Software Centre? no?
2012-08-04T19:35:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 i.e. the proper way haha
2012-08-04T19:39:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 man ln , it will show you the syntax and possibly examples
2012-08-04T19:40:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 oops I meant "link name" not shortcut
2012-08-04T19:51:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 If you install Java the proper way, like with Software Centre and synaptic, I think it's more likely to work and troubleshoot
2012-08-04T20:06:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 maybe it's still installing? When it's done it should throw you back to the bash prompt
2012-08-04T20:08:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 yeah
2012-08-04T20:11:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 np, and yeah
2012-08-04T20:23:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 yeah, hi
2012-08-04T20:46:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 I'm really not sure, /opt or ~/bin I guess. How are you planning to install programs other than Software Centre?
2012-08-04T20:47:00.000Z	JavaKid	NewWorld	I mean things downloaded not in the Software Center such as Minecraft and Teamspeak
2012-08-04T20:47:00.000Z	JavaKid	NewWorld	Basically an app that isn't in Software Center
2012-08-04T20:48:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 Minecraft is just a .jar file with configs and saves in .minecraft . I don't know how you're planning to install Teamspeak, but if you're compiling programs from source and installing, they install to /usr/ usually. .deb packages also install to /usr
2012-08-04T20:51:00.000Z	JavaKid	NewWorld	How do I copy a file and all it's contents to a folder which requires permission (via terminal). i know i need to use sudo but what's after that/
2012-08-04T20:51:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 cp
2012-08-04T20:52:00.000Z	JavaKid	NewWorld	How does cp work?
2012-08-04T20:53:00.000Z	NewWorld	JavaKid	 `man cp` . use man for manual of cammands)
