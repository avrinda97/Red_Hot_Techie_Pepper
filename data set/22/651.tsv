2011-05-29T02:38:00.000Z	deltik		Hi
2011-05-29T02:40:00.000Z	deltik		@Everyone: Who here is experienced with laptops running Ubuntu?
2011-05-29T02:41:00.000Z	deltik		Sorry... I'm very new to the IRC protocol
2011-05-29T02:41:00.000Z	deltik		How do I target specific users?
2011-05-29T02:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deltik	type their name, you can use tab to autocomplete
2011-05-29T02:44:00.000Z	deltik	ActionParsnip	Got it.
2011-05-29T02:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deltik	it solves the shortcomings of the legacy version though. Once its setup you don't have to mess with it
2011-05-29T03:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deltik	you will need to clean install if you do
2011-05-29T03:00:00.000Z	deltik	ActionParsnip	I have my backups made.
2011-05-29T03:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deltik	if you unininstall then reinstall the ati driver, is it better
2011-05-29T03:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deltik	have you tried a clean install of natty, clean install gives far fewer issues
2011-05-29T03:01:00.000Z	deltik	ActionParsnip	It was a clean install, and ubiquity reinstalled the packages for me
2011-05-29T03:01:00.000Z	deltik	ActionParsnip	The packages I had before, that is.
2011-05-29T03:02:00.000Z	deltik	ActionParsnip	So it's the driver that's in question?
2011-05-29T03:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deltik	i'd say so, proprietary drivers rarely survive changing release
2011-05-29T03:04:00.000Z	deltik	ActionParsnip	It's the same driver... I don't see why a problem would be caused.
2011-05-29T03:04:00.000Z	deltik	ActionParsnip	And the driver was reinstalled after the upgrade.
2011-05-29T03:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deltik	even if its the same driver the OS has to recreate the kernel module to make it run under the new kernel
2011-05-29T03:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deltik	this rarely goes well during the upgrade phase so removing it, then reinstalling it under the new branch of the kernel can help graetly
2011-05-29T03:09:00.000Z	deltik	ActionParsnip	I used ubiquity to do the upgrade, which removed Ubuntu 10.10, installed a fresh copy, then restored most of my packages.
2011-05-29T03:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deltik	thats all I know, persoanlly I never upgrade and always clean install. It gives way fewer headaches
2011-05-29T03:11:00.000Z	deltik	ActionParsnip	The last problem before this one I had with Ubuntu was 9.10. I stayed at Ubuntu 9.04, but here, this is Unity I will be missing if I downgrade.
