2006-10-28T05:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Elazar	the liveCD (from dapper on) has an install option, it's an icon on the desktop
2006-10-28T05:16:00.000Z	Elazar	Flannel	Can't find a LiveCD link on the site. Are they not distributing a LiveCD apart from the regular installation anymore?
2006-10-28T05:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Elazar	the liveCD is now the 'desktop' CD, and the old textmode installer is now the 'Alternate' CD
2006-10-28T05:20:00.000Z	Elazar	Flannel	Would I not be able to get the files off the drive using a server installation CD?
2006-10-28T05:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Elazar	what? which files? what are you doing?
2006-10-28T05:21:00.000Z	Elazar	Flannel	Trying to get my data off the drive before I install. I was planning on installing from a server CD.
2006-10-28T05:21:00.000Z	Flannel	Elazar	ah, I see.  No, the server CD (besides installing a GUILess box, are you sure you want that? and not the alternate CD?) won't allow you to do anything except install (it's not a liveCD)
2006-10-28T05:25:00.000Z	Elazar	Flannel	Depends... what exactly IS the alternate CD?
2006-10-28T05:26:00.000Z	Elazar	Flannel	I was mostly after a bare-bones installation. I was going to install packages piecemeal after that to get what I want. The default installation comes with a lot more than I really need.
2006-10-28T05:28:00.000Z	Flannel	Elazar	you're better off using the Alternate CD, and using the 'server' install option on that, than the server CD, if bandwidth isn't an issue
2006-10-28T05:29:00.000Z	Elazar	Flannel	What's the difference?
2006-10-28T05:29:00.000Z	Flannel	Elazar	however, neither the alternate, nor the server CDs will allow you read/copy stuff from your current drive
2006-10-28T05:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Elazar	well, the serverCD installs optimized kernels for server environments, which you'll have to switch to use as a desktop (or performance suffers)
2006-10-28T05:30:00.000Z	Elazar	Flannel	Whereas the alternate CD doesn't do that?
2006-10-28T05:35:00.000Z	Elazar	Flannel	So the alternate CD with the server option doesn't include those server-specific enhancements?
2006-10-28T05:36:00.000Z	Flannel	Elazar	right, it'll install the normal desktop kernel,  of course it is also 700mb instead of 400, because it also has the entire ubuntu-desktop
2006-10-28T05:39:00.000Z	Elazar	Flannel	Is that all it has, as far as supplements to the bare-bones install?
2006-10-28T05:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Elazar	what?  Alternate does have some additional packages on it, ubuntu + more stuff, if you didn't have a desktop.  You might however be interested in grabbing the xubuntu alternate CD, if xubuntu is lightweight enough for you
2006-10-28T05:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Elazar	the xubuntu alternate will also install the (flavor independant) basic, GUIless, server install too.
2006-10-28T05:44:00.000Z	Elazar	Flannel	I was hoping for either GUIless or GUI only and to be able to manually install packages from there.
2006-10-28T05:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Elazar	right, any install disk will get you that.  I personally prefer the alternate CD, with the server install option, which is just plain vanilla ubuntu, without any GUI.
2006-10-28T05:46:00.000Z	Elazar	Flannel	Cool. Thank you very much for the advice. :)
