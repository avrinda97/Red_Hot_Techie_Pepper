2005-08-10T09:38:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	tha_gamemaster	yea thats right

2005-08-10T09:39:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	^thehatsrule^	ati all in wonder radeon ...32MB and 64MB one's a 7000 something i think
2005-08-10T09:39:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	tha_gamemaster	thats not supported by official drivers, youll have to get your hands on 3rd party drivers
2005-08-10T09:40:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	tha_gamemaster	official supports radeons 8500+
2005-08-10T09:40:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	^thehatsrule^	ah these are too old then, thanks, *laughs* my brother is having a nightmare with his ati under winblows, and I enjoy my linux without error
2005-08-10T09:41:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	tha_gamemaster	hehe, you can buy 3d drivers if you need it... XiG i think it was
2005-08-10T09:41:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	^thehatsrule^	buy drivers you say? i'm confuzzled...
2005-08-10T09:42:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	tha_gamemaster	yea, theyre commercial
2005-08-10T09:42:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	tha_gamemaster	ati's just starting to give a little linux support for their new cards...
2005-08-10T09:42:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	^thehatsrule^	is this the company you were talking about ? http://www.xig.com/Pages/Summit/HdweSupported/ChipINDEX.html
2005-08-10T09:43:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	tha_gamemaster	yeah, xig :)
2005-08-10T09:44:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	tha_gamemaster	i know it should work, cause AA recommends it for linux
2005-08-10T09:44:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	^thehatsrule^	cool, thanks. I'm looking at all this hardware and just aching to do something linux with it, but not too many ideas.
2005-08-10T09:44:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	tha_gamemaster	yeah, heh... i had my hands on a radeon 7k too, but didnt bother to buy the drivers
2005-08-10T09:46:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	^thehatsrule^	separate question, any suggestions how to set up linux to act as a port restricter between one computer and the network? i just want to allow like 4 ports to one machine
2005-08-10T09:47:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	tha_gamemaster	like a linux router? try using some firewall, like iptables
2005-08-10T09:47:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	^thehatsrule^	yea just like a router, but EXTREMELY restrictive
2005-08-10T09:47:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	tha_gamemaster	yea you can just config it in the firewall
2005-08-10T09:47:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	^thehatsrule^	cool i've got to look at it...
