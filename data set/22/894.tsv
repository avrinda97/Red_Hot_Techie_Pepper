2011-01-28T09:37:00.000Z	aflyingturtle		they shud
2011-01-28T09:37:00.000Z	aflyingturtle		well
2011-01-28T09:37:00.000Z	aflyingturtle		at least i think they do
2011-01-28T09:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	aflyingturtle	I'm not sure
2011-01-28T09:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	aflyingturtle	I think it can be normaly shutdown by killing gdm
2011-01-28T09:32:00.000Z	aflyingturtle	sacarlson	so look at the activity manager and kill gdm?
2011-01-28T09:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	aflyingturtle	you could try ps -A  and see if gdm is running then try killall gdm  I guess,  I'm not sure what that will do
2011-01-28T09:35:00.000Z	aflyingturtle	sacarlson	theres gdm-binary and gdm-simple-slav
2011-01-28T09:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	aflyingturtle	I see a process gnome-session that might wipe out most of your X sessions
2011-01-28T09:39:00.000Z	aflyingturtle	sacarlson	just go for either one?
2011-01-28T09:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	aflyingturtle	if you hit the top they will all fall
2011-01-28T09:40:00.000Z	aflyingturtle	sacarlson	so just hit one out?
2011-01-28T09:41:00.000Z	aflyingturtle	sacarlson	I'll hit out the binary. It sounds more important
2011-01-28T09:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	aflyingturtle	experiment at your own risk,  just start to kill and see what happens,  maybe in a virtualbox session that won't damage anything
2011-01-28T09:43:00.000Z	aflyingturtle	sacarlson	That was weird. Left me with a blinking cursor that wouldn't let me type anything. Reacted to the power button though and turned off succesfully
2011-01-28T09:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	aflyingturtle	I knew I could break something
2011-01-28T09:44:00.000Z	aflyingturtle	sacarlson	I think its ok. Cause it reacted to power off succesfully.
2011-01-28T09:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	aflyingturtle	maybe before you close it you should just try <alt><ctl> +f2
2011-01-28T09:44:00.000Z	aflyingturtle	sacarlson	whats that supposed to do?
2011-01-28T09:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	aflyingturtle	that will put you at a none graphic console
2011-01-28T09:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	aflyingturtle	<alt><ctl> + f7 should return you to your X session
2011-01-28T09:47:00.000Z	aflyingturtle	sacarlson	WORKED. thank you so much. have been trying to figure this out for ages
