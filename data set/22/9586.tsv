2005-02-23T14:49:00.000Z	bob2		indeed
2005-02-23T14:50:00.000Z	bob2		maybe you should just not paste random stuff from other channels?
2005-02-23T14:51:00.000Z	bob2		it means nothing except that it got printed out
2005-02-23T14:52:00.000Z	bob2		that's not a gnome issue
2005-02-23T14:52:00.000Z	bob2		that's a "you have too much money" issue ;)
2005-02-23T14:52:00.000Z	glyph	bob2	esad, etc ;)
2005-02-23T14:53:00.000Z	glyph	bob2	I use VoIP for work
2005-02-23T14:53:00.000Z	glyph	bob2	One of the devices in question is the crappy on-board sound card, which actually cost negative money.  One is the soundblaster live that I bought because the onboard one was so crappy I couldn't stand it.  One of them is a logitech USB headset that I use for VoIP
2005-02-23T14:54:00.000Z	glyph	bob2	but, backing off from the multiple-device question, I need to change mixer settings even if I just had one sound card: it's defaulting to change the "master" volume on my sblive, which, as far as I can tell, affects nothing at all
2005-02-23T14:54:00.000Z	glyph	bob2	I need to change it to "Wave" in order to make it affect the actual volume.
2005-02-23T14:56:00.000Z	glyph	bob2	Well, that's what I do too.  I'd just like it if the on-the-cord volume buttons on my headset would work.  It's a huge pain when somebody is raping my ear with a SUPER loud mic on the other end of a voice connection and it takes me like 30 seconds to change the volume :)
2005-02-23T14:58:00.000Z	glyph	bob2	Yeah, when I first got it I thought it was really neat!  I plugged it in and pushed them, and the little gnome "I'm changing the volume" progress-bar-window came up
2005-02-23T15:07:00.000Z	glyph	bob2	I count at least 3
2005-02-23T15:07:00.000Z	glyph	bob2	mixer applet, "volume control" preference pane, keyboard keys
2005-02-23T15:07:00.000Z	glyph	bob2	Ohhhhh
2005-02-23T15:07:00.000Z	glyph	bob2	so I have to configure *gstreamer*'s default mixer device?
2005-02-23T15:07:00.000Z	glyph	bob2	is there a preference pane for that/
2005-06-19T13:34:00.000Z	bob2	glyph	the power manage scripts unload the driver for it, btw
2005-06-19T13:34:00.000Z	glyph	bob2	yeah, unloading the driver is another problem
2005-06-19T13:35:00.000Z	bob2	glyph	is there a bug open about that?
2005-06-19T13:36:00.000Z	glyph	bob2	Possibly.  I don't know how to list the symptoms, exactly.  Sometimes, non-deterministically, an 'rmmod ipw2200' will just freeze every process touching the network, (like, zombie processes, kill -9 does nothing)
2005-06-19T13:46:00.000Z	bob2	glyph	archive.ubuntu.com is fine
