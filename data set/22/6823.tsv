2006-07-19T14:47:00.000Z	mneptok	nyriador	i would recommend you stay away from any automated scripts
2006-07-19T14:48:00.000Z	nyriador	mneptok	yeah. i'm starting to think i'd better....
2006-07-19T14:48:00.000Z	mneptok	nyriador	those things are the fscking *bane* of my existence. i loathe them.
2006-07-19T14:49:00.000Z	mneptok	nyriador	often time the authors make some *really* bad decisions
2006-07-19T14:50:00.000Z	mneptok	nyriador	this is one of my favorite examples of just how stupid those automated scripts can be: "sudo sed -ie '/^%admin/s/ALL$/NOPASSWD: ALL/' /etc/sudoers"
2006-07-19T14:50:00.000Z	mneptok	nyriador	that turns off the need for sudo to require a password, but they don't set -e, so if the script fails, sudo will never require a password again. unbelievably horrid.
2006-07-19T14:51:00.000Z	nyriador	mneptok	that's rather dumb... wonder why they'd do that in the first place.
2006-07-19T14:52:00.000Z	mneptok	nyriador	because often the authors of these scripts are adherents to the Microsoft "features over security and correctness" coding ideals
2006-07-19T14:52:00.000Z	nyriador	mneptok	 - kinda defeats the point of being on linux,..
2006-07-19T14:53:00.000Z	mneptok	nyriador	which is why those scripts are the bane of my existence, and why we do not recommend them ;)
2006-07-19T14:54:00.000Z	mneptok	nyriador	why use a script? just use Synaptic and be happy.
2006-07-19T14:56:00.000Z	mneptok	nyriador	what goals do you want to accomplish first?
2006-07-19T14:57:00.000Z	nyriador	mneptok	well. i want to be able to install the multimedia codecs - music, mainly
2006-07-19T14:57:00.000Z	mneptok	nyriador	install gstreamer-plugins-ugly from the Universe repo
2006-07-19T15:00:00.000Z	nyriador	mneptok	- will do. now, i took a screenshot of the error message the terminal gave me while i was trying to get easyubuntu to run. it says at some point "dependency problem prevent config of redhat-cluster-suite"and something about "clvm not configured yet" - is that a problem? i'm just concerned this issue will re-appear at some point, with something more significant than easyubuntu.
2006-07-19T15:02:00.000Z	mneptok	nyriador	just ignore what those horrendous scripts tell you. don't worry about problems you don't have. ;)
2006-07-19T15:03:00.000Z	nyriador	mneptok	well, then i'm off to see if i can install those codecs manually. i'll be back later - probably... anyways, thanks for the help guys.
2006-07-19T15:03:00.000Z	mneptok	nyriador	gstreamer-plugins-ugly is what you want
2006-07-19T15:09:00.000Z	nyriador	mneptok	- i just tried installing the gstreamer libraries, and here is the message i got : E: clvm: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 3
2006-07-19T15:09:00.000Z	mneptok	nyriador	sounds like that script hosed your repos
2006-07-19T15:10:00.000Z	mneptok	nyriador	look in /etc/apt and see what you have relating to sources.list
2006-07-19T15:15:00.000Z	nyriador	mneptok	things look ok in etc\apt
