2010-08-28T22:57:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	arrrghhh	smbfs is not part of samba its an extra package
2010-08-28T22:57:00.000Z	arrrghhh	WinstonSmith	i did not know that... i guess i don't remember dealing with it.
2010-08-28T22:58:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	arrrghhh	i had this problem before ... the superblock error msg ... apt-get install smbfs fixed that
2010-08-28T23:01:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	arrrghhh	well spaces in file names never helped anybody :O
2010-08-28T23:02:00.000Z	arrrghhh	WinstonSmith	not in linux, that's for sure.... the \040 worked for me in fstab tho.
2010-08-28T23:02:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	arrrghhh	yes there a ways around it... but its so much easier to use a underscore or dot i think
2010-08-28T23:03:00.000Z	arrrghhh	WinstonSmith	i guess... i had folders that could not change - other clients were already using them, so to keep from changing all the clients, i just modified this client with that \040 trick...
2010-08-28T23:04:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	arrrghhh	right on the spot ... 1 of the reasons why i just love it ... infinite possibilities lol
2010-08-28T23:05:00.000Z	arrrghhh	WinstonSmith	just like programming!  i know that's why i love it as well.  as a newbie, it's overwhelming tho.  i guess that's why linux will never take over as 'the' desktop platform.
2010-08-28T23:06:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	arrrghhh	yes its getting better though. but me i just love tinkering & fiddling with something :D
2010-08-29T00:37:00.000Z	arrrghhh	WinstonSmith	is there any difference between that and the update-grub2 command...?
2010-08-29T00:38:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	arrrghhh	not sure i just used update-grub all the time
2010-08-29T00:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh	WinstonSmith	it always freaked me out there were two, and i've always used the 2 version of the update-grub command..
2010-08-29T00:39:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	arrrghhh	i have to say that editing grub used to be waaaaay easier ;(
2010-08-29T00:39:00.000Z	arrrghhh	WinstonSmith	yes... yes it did.
2010-08-29T00:39:00.000Z	arrrghhh	WinstonSmith	but, with grub2 i haven't really had to edit it.
2010-08-29T00:40:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	arrrghhh	now its kind of .... well confusing.... before it was a matter of editing menu.lst and you are done
2010-08-29T00:40:00.000Z	arrrghhh	WinstonSmith	oh i know.  it is odd, but like i said i haven't had to edit anything since grub2.  i just remove old stuff from /boot when i test that the new stuff is good, then update-grub2 and i'm done.
2010-08-29T00:41:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	arrrghhh	yes me too i really dont understand why it got MORE complicated???
2010-08-29T00:42:00.000Z	arrrghhh	WinstonSmith	it seems everything has.  the new systemV scripts for startup or whatever seem way more confusing than /etc/init.d... but ubuntu always did funky things with startup scripts.
2010-08-29T00:43:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	arrrghhh	well all systems have this tendency to get more and more complicated :(
2010-08-29T00:43:00.000Z	arrrghhh	WinstonSmith	more code... more complication.  in the end they're trying to make things easier to administer, we just have to learn the new ways.  some decisions like putting landscape on a server make no damned sense, but that's off-topic.
