2010-11-11T16:36:00.000Z	sarge1221		I'm having the worst day ever. I just ran photoRec on a external harddrive from my ubuntu 10.04 and something is seriously wrong. I did a restart and the OS itself can't can't mount dbs1 on the splash screen? I tried safe mode and it says gnome power configurations have been installed incorrectly with it still not booting.
2010-11-11T16:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sarge1221	sounds like the recovered data is still bad
2010-11-11T16:39:00.000Z	sarge1221	ActionParsnip	no i can't log in as another user.
2010-11-11T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sarge1221	that wasn't aimed at you
2010-11-11T16:40:00.000Z	sarge1221	ActionParsnip	oh sorry my mistake.
2010-11-11T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sarge1221	only text that is prefixed with your name is aimed at you
2010-11-11T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sarge1221	restore from backups, if the data is important it will be backed up
2010-11-11T16:44:00.000Z	sarge1221	ActionParsnip	When you say backup do oyu mean the previous listing from grub or a actual backup i made myself?
2010-11-11T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sarge1221	backups you made yourself of the important data
2010-11-11T16:45:00.000Z	sarge1221	ActionParsnip	.... it just got worst.
2010-11-11T16:46:00.000Z	sarge1221	ActionParsnip	I didn't have any place to backup to so i never backed up as you can clearly see my external harddrive was not a good place to begin with in fact it is so screwed up it has now some how killed my linux OS.
2010-11-11T16:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sarge1221	then its not very miportant data, drives fail all the time, its not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. So storing "important data" in a single location is not wise
2010-11-11T16:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sarge1221	you can use foremost to read the data and extract it to a healthy partition, the recovered data consistancy is in no way guarunteed, it may have gaps or be garbaged, but you can then reinstall and then put the data back on it
2010-11-11T16:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sarge1221	if you had backups you could just wipe the disk, reinstall and restore. But you learned the value of this the hard way
2010-11-11T16:50:00.000Z	sarge1221	ActionParsnip	I don't need the backup preaching it is a bad situation all around. I was trying to fix my external so i could store stuff on it when i nfact i have now created the very problem i was trying to avoid.
2011-01-25T21:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sarge1221	its in theUbuntu repo so is supported if you use Ubuntu
2011-01-25T21:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sarge1221	supported here, that is
2011-01-25T21:09:00.000Z	sarge1221	ActionParsnip	No I have it installed. I want some help in figuring out exactly what the log is reporting.
2011-01-25T21:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sarge1221	well you can ignore the 'ok' lines, if you pastebin the rest we may be able to comment
2011-01-25T21:21:00.000Z	sarge1221	ActionParsnip	Okay I have it ready. http://pastebin.com/cxxCE0a9
2011-01-25T21:29:00.000Z	sarge1221	ActionParsnip	Is it looking pretty bad or are most of those nothing to worry about?
2011-01-25T21:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sarge1221	I'm not conversant with the app, sorry
