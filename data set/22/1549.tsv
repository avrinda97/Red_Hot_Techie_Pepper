2010-04-15T13:46:00.000Z	widar	jad	I dont know if grep or sed support it, but if you are provided perl, you could do it using something like while(<>) { /(/d+ (MB|GB))/; print $1;}
2010-04-15T13:47:00.000Z	jad	widar	thx
2010-04-15T13:48:00.000Z	widar	jad	Consider it as a  draft, I did not test it and I doubt it works without some debugging - just trying to give you an idea you could work on
2010-04-15T13:48:00.000Z	jad		im not very much into perl
2010-04-15T13:48:00.000Z	jad		is there no way of doing it using grep -o or sed
2010-04-15T13:56:00.000Z	widar	jad	Could you use a perl script or is it essential to stick to grep/sed?
2010-04-15T14:00:00.000Z	jad	widar	ill just learn pearl
2010-04-15T14:01:00.000Z	widar	jad	Here is a little script that does what I guess you want to be done. Its a little blown up though:
2010-04-15T14:01:00.000Z	widar		#!/usr/bin/perl
2010-04-15T14:01:00.000Z	widar		$t = 0;
2010-04-15T14:01:00.000Z	widar		while(<>) {
2010-04-15T14:01:00.000Z	widar		  @findings = /(\d+ (MB|GB))/g;
2010-04-15T14:01:00.000Z	widar		  for $found (@findings) {
2010-04-15T14:01:00.000Z	widar		    print "$found\n" unless $t == 1;
2010-04-15T14:02:00.000Z	widar	jad	(At least within this context: "echo "1 GB out of which 200 MB" | ./test.pl"  )
2010-04-15T14:03:00.000Z	jad		thx
2010-04-15T14:03:00.000Z	jad	widar	thx, that's very helpful
