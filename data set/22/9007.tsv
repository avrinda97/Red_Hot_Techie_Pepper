2006-02-20T15:38:00.000Z	AntMaz		so you have any idea how to correct this through shell sense (i have no sense) i cant access anything admin wise
2006-02-20T15:39:00.000Z	AntMaz		try that in shell
2006-02-20T15:41:00.000Z	AntMaz		ok now what
2006-02-20T15:41:00.000Z	AntMaz		telinit sounds like telet
2006-02-20T15:41:00.000Z	AntMaz		telnet
2006-02-20T15:43:00.000Z	AntMaz		anthony@ubuntu:~$ sudo adduser
2006-02-20T15:43:00.000Z	AntMaz		anthony is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
2006-02-20T15:45:00.000Z	AntMaz		dont mean to pain how do i do that
2006-02-20T15:45:00.000Z	AntMaz		im in the 5th day of my windows- linux transformation
2006-02-20T15:45:00.000Z	fangorious	AntMaz	all users in the adm group have sudo privilege
2006-02-20T15:46:00.000Z	fangorious	AntMaz	but the user you created during installation should already have that
2006-02-20T15:47:00.000Z	fangorious	AntMaz	boot into single user mode, and run 'gpasswd -a anthony adm' as root
2006-02-20T15:48:00.000Z	fangorious	AntMaz	do you know how to boot in single user mode?
2006-02-20T15:51:00.000Z	fangorious	AntMaz	booting in single user mode will give you a root shell
2006-02-20T15:52:00.000Z	fangorious	AntMaz	yep
2006-02-20T15:54:00.000Z	fangorious	AntMaz	is that to find all .exe files recursively? find . -name "*.exe"
2006-02-20T15:58:00.000Z	fangorious	AntMaz	when grub loads, it should give you a menu, and a 10 second countdown (I think 10 seconds is the default), just use the up/down arrow keys to select your ubuntu install and hit 'e'
2006-02-20T16:35:00.000Z	fangorious	AntMaz	booted in single user mode? users-admin needs X, did you try the gpasswd command?
2006-02-20T16:37:00.000Z	fangorious	AntMaz	run 'id -a' as anthony, do you see adm listed as one of your groups?
2006-02-20T16:41:00.000Z	fangorious	AntMaz	so you're a member of the adm group now, try 'sudo gedit' (or some other equally inane command)
2006-02-20T16:45:00.000Z	fangorious	AntMaz	are you runnging 'sudo users-admin' or clicking on System->Administration->Users (should have the same result either way)
2006-02-20T16:51:00.000Z	fangorious	AntMaz	?
