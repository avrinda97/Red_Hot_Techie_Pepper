2008-01-18T18:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Ar-ras	netboot the cdimage rather than the netboot image

2008-01-18T18:47:00.000Z	Ar-ras	ikonia	i can boot netboot, but if i try to boot ubuntu iso content it sais kernel panic
2008-01-18T18:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Ar-ras	I don't think you'll be able to use the physical cd image as that has hard device links in
2008-01-18T18:49:00.000Z	Ar-ras	ikonia	any idea?
2008-01-18T18:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Ar-ras	ideas for what ?
