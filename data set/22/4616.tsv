2007-11-27T23:18:00.000Z	MystaMax	Ramphis	are you having troubles getting an IP address?
2007-11-27T23:21:00.000Z	MystaMax	Ramphis	do you have a static IP address or is your network running a DHCP server
2007-11-27T23:21:00.000Z	Ramphis	MystaMax	I wish I would know that :S
2007-11-27T23:23:00.000Z	MystaMax	Ramphis	who gave you the IP address? did they give you a subnet and a gateway as well?
2007-11-27T23:24:00.000Z	MystaMax	Ramphis	you need a subnet and a gateway

2007-11-27T23:32:00.000Z	MystaMax	Ramphis	the only thing that looks odd to me is your nameserver. doesn't seem right
2007-11-27T23:33:00.000Z	MystaMax	Ramphis	who gave you this IP information? are you at a school or something?
2007-11-27T23:33:00.000Z	Ramphis	MystaMax	my Internet provider
2007-11-27T23:33:00.000Z	MystaMax	Ramphis	are you running gnome?
2007-11-27T23:35:00.000Z	MystaMax	Ramphis	Core64 is mystamax as well, I'm on two comptuers so you know
2007-11-27T23:38:00.000Z	MystaMax	Ramphis	gotcha, in windows, go to the control panel -> Network connections -> locate your LAN connection and double click it. When you see the status window go to the support tab, and let me know when u are there
2007-11-27T23:40:00.000Z	MystaMax	Ramphis	I want you to show me the connection status info
2007-11-27T23:42:00.000Z	MystaMax	Ramphis	good, you'll need that so write all that down. Above the IP addy does it say assigned by DHCP or static?
2007-11-27T23:43:00.000Z	Ramphis	MystaMax	dunno :S ... I dont know a lot by nets lol XD
2007-11-27T23:46:00.000Z	MystaMax	Ramphis	did you send me something?
2007-11-27T23:47:00.000Z	MystaMax	Ramphis	on the LAN status window, above IP address it says "Address type" assigned by DHCP (on my win box it does) what does yours say
2007-11-27T23:49:00.000Z	MystaMax	Ramphis	ah ok
