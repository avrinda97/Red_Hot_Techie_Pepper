2010-01-05T12:21:00.000Z	wolter	acer1	you might want to run [$ alsamixer] in a terminal
2010-01-05T12:22:00.000Z	acer1	wolter	it doesnt work even after unmuting everythn
2010-01-05T12:22:00.000Z	wolter	acer1	you mean it doesn't detect input?
2010-01-05T12:23:00.000Z	wolter	acer1	hm... yeah so, you basically can't connect a jack to your computer to play sound externally
2010-01-05T12:23:00.000Z	wolter	acer1	have you tried gnome-alsamixer?
2010-01-05T12:25:00.000Z	wolter	acer1	oh yeah.. i had a similar problem going on
2010-01-05T12:26:00.000Z	wolter	acer1	hm.. you sure nothings muted, or with lowered volume?
2010-01-05T12:27:00.000Z	wolter	acer1	yes, I was doing that, but then I came back to pulse and it was fixed
2010-01-05T12:27:00.000Z	wolter	acer1	but when you open alsamixer do you see "Master Headphone <Something else>" ?
2010-01-05T12:28:00.000Z	acer1	wolter	only headphone
2010-01-05T12:29:00.000Z	wolter	acer1	thats weird
2010-01-05T12:29:00.000Z	wolter	acer1	listen to okan, I will do a reboot
