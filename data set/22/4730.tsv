2007-10-30T14:12:00.000Z	OpenGuru		f2 to f6
2007-10-30T14:12:00.000Z	rubystallion	OpenGuru	Doesn't work.
2007-10-30T14:13:00.000Z	OpenGuru	rubystallion	are u running compiz ?
2007-10-30T14:13:00.000Z	rubystallion	OpenGuru	Yes
2007-10-30T14:13:00.000Z	OpenGuru		I had same problem while running compiz
2007-10-30T14:13:00.000Z	OpenGuru		had the quit xserver and restart
2007-10-30T14:13:00.000Z	OpenGuru	rubystallion	press control alt backspace
2007-10-30T14:14:00.000Z	OpenGuru	rubystallion	it will restart x11 after which you can goto terminal
2007-10-30T14:16:00.000Z	OpenGuru	rubystallion	whether it worked ?
2007-10-30T14:16:00.000Z	rubystallion		Sorry, could you tell me your suggestion again? I pressed the keys too early.
2007-10-30T14:17:00.000Z	rubystallion	OpenGuru	Sorry, could you tell me your suggestion again? I pressed the keys too early.
2007-10-30T14:17:00.000Z	OpenGuru	rubystallion	there is some problem in compiz due to which its not possible to goto terminal. solution is to close x11 then goto terminal.
2007-10-30T14:18:00.000Z	OpenGuru	rubystallion	if you press control alt backspace, it will restart your x11 afer which you can goto terminal.
2007-10-30T14:18:00.000Z	rubystallion	OpenGuru	Hmm, I pressed ctrl alt bs, then I had to login again and compiz restarted, too.
2007-10-30T14:19:00.000Z	OpenGuru	rubystallion	no no.. while you are in login screen goto terminal. once you login its not possible.
2007-10-30T14:19:00.000Z	rubystallion	OpenGuru	Ah okay, I'll try that now.
2007-10-30T14:19:00.000Z	OpenGuru	rubystallion	i think its dues same keys are used by compiz. check your shortcuts used by compiz.
2007-10-30T14:20:00.000Z	OpenGuru	rubystallion	best of luck
2007-10-30T14:20:00.000Z	rubystallion	OpenGuru	Thank you!
2007-10-30T14:26:00.000Z	rubystallion	OpenGuru	It worked. But I better try to change the compiz shortcuts. Actually I just wanted to disable all those shortcuts from X and the terminal like alt-tab. The console is a little too spartan for my taste.
