2011-08-11T23:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight		guys, can someone tell me what happened to the "World Clock Applet" that integrated into the clock on the panel? Not seen since 11.04 install.  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardyHeron/Beta#World_Clock_Applet
2011-08-11T23:59:00.000Z	lauratika	livingdaylight	i think it's gone with the wind
2011-08-12T00:00:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	gone?
2011-08-12T00:00:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	wanna install it, but not sure its exact name
2011-08-12T00:02:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	11.04 which is why I don't have it
2011-08-12T00:03:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	I'm in ubuntu classic
2011-08-12T00:03:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	no it isn't
2011-08-12T00:04:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	there is a clock but not the option in the drop down menu to add other world location times
2011-08-12T00:05:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	are you in 11.04 and seeing this?
2011-08-12T00:06:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	strange I do not have it.
2011-08-12T00:07:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	I thought if I could get the name of that component/applet I could go and install it from synaptic. But can't get the name
2011-08-12T00:07:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	lol - yes :D
2011-08-12T00:08:00.000Z	lauratika	livingdaylight	i did yesterday a fresh install of OS and it's there as always... what you have in time date and settings?
2011-08-12T00:11:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	I'm going to reboot and see if that helps
2011-08-12T00:16:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	that didn't help. I'm surprised that you have it. Can you see in synaptics what it might be called, please?
2011-08-12T00:18:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	this is the option that I now see when I click on the panel clock - http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/853/clockik.png/
2011-08-12T00:19:00.000Z	lauratika	livingdaylight	you have to click on clock
2011-08-12T00:20:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	I have been using gnome for a long time. What used to be there isn't. the clock option only allows me to set and configure the clock
2011-08-12T00:21:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	no, Can you give me the name so I can fetch it fromsynaptic?
2011-08-12T00:22:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	I want this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardyHeron/Beta#World_Clock_Applet
2011-08-12T00:24:00.000Z	livingdaylight	lauratika	if I click on clock I get two options. 1) Add an event (which launches Evolution).  (2) Time and Date Settings, which when I click on it opens the dialog which I showed you a screenshot of.
2011-08-12T00:28:00.000Z	lauratika	livingdaylight	do notice the applet you are refering is from ubuntu 8 and there has being some ontegration since then, it's under clock as trism said and also another way to access and configure it is on the clock tab at the rigth hand fomr the screen shot you send
