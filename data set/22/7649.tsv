2006-02-19T14:47:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	so..
2006-02-19T14:57:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	nm, I think I have found the solution
2006-02-21T09:42:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	lspci
2006-02-21T09:44:00.000Z	rewt_	hatake_kakashi	0000:05:02.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation: Unknown device 4318 (rev 02)
2006-02-21T09:45:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	seems like it, is there any other network, ethernet controller you have?
2006-02-21T09:46:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	look for broadcom driver for linux, that may help
2006-02-21T09:47:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	if there is none, you may have to use ndiswrapper, kinda like running windows drivers through wine to get it translated onto linux. To go about on that, I'm not too sure exactly
2006-02-21T09:52:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	you can surf the net with wired right?
2006-02-21T10:13:00.000Z	rewt_	hatake_kakashi	says the page does not exist yet
2006-02-21T10:14:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	meh, well I suppose searching around on the site may help
2006-02-21T10:17:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	unzip
2006-02-21T10:21:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	yes you can run that through wine
2006-02-21T12:01:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	you're not going to tell me that your fan is electronically controlled via acpi?
2006-02-21T12:02:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	Advanced Configuratable(?) Power Interface
2006-02-21T12:03:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	designed to prevent excessive power usage
2006-02-21T12:03:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	for cpu? depends, google around for answers
2006-02-21T12:14:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	the great firewall of china
2006-02-21T12:14:00.000Z	rewt_	hatake_kakashi	 huh?
2006-02-21T12:15:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	China has blocked many external sites and tries to promote 'healthy' internet lifestyle. Google had to make their own specific google.cn which also enforces the Chinese govt.'s idea
2006-02-21T12:16:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	because google want's to be known no matter where I suppose.. even MS too wants to be known eveywhere
2006-02-21T12:17:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	probably, but not google.cn
2006-02-21T12:18:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	rewt_	dunno, I don't live there
