2006-09-02T09:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SkyNeT	DO you really use skynet? I looked into that... pm me when you get a chance..
2006-09-02T10:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SkyNeT	I watched you go through and creat your partitions, was there a reason you did it manually?
2006-09-02T10:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SkyNeT	Personally, I would just delete the partition and the swap and tell the installer to use all unallocated space.. But that would be a big step backwards at this point
2006-09-02T10:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SkyNeT	YOu should have been able to tell the installer to use that whole drive and let it rip
2006-09-02T10:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SkyNeT	YOu have windows on there now?
2006-09-02T10:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SkyNeT	Ok, so you have 20 gig you want to use for Ubuntu?
2006-09-02T10:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SkyNeT	Did you create any partitons there?
2006-09-02T10:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SkyNeT	Why the extra partition?
2006-09-02T10:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SkyNeT	k
2006-09-02T10:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SkyNeT	Personally I would delete those other partitions.. then just tell the installer to use all unallocated space and let it take care of it for you
2006-09-02T10:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SkyNeT	No problem, I understand... good luck
2006-09-02T10:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SkyNeT	ONe partition for XP one for Ubuntu and a swap
