2007-08-25T05:17:00.000Z	Stev		ciao a tutti
2007-08-25T05:17:00.000Z	Stev		hem... hi
2007-08-25T05:17:00.000Z	Stev		i've a problem with network-manager applet
2007-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	EpochWolf	Stev	what's the issue?
2007-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	Stev		i can see wireless networks but cannot connect to them (with other programs everything works fine)
2007-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	Stev		seems that it's all ok but dhcp :D
2007-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	EpochWolf	Stev	that's a driver issue.
2007-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	Stev		if i manually run dhclient eth1 then it works
2007-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	EpochWolf	Stev	which wireless card?
2007-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	EpochWolf	Stev	oh.. interesting.
2007-08-25T05:19:00.000Z	Stev		02:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection (rev 02)
2007-08-25T05:19:00.000Z	EpochWolf	Stev	nice... that card has decent drivers.
2007-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	EpochWolf	Stev	I don't know what the issue would be..
2007-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	Stev	EpochWolf	if i run dhclient then i get an ip and everythiong works but the "shape" on the applet keeps spinning and after a while it disconnects
2007-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	Stev		if i manually connect everything works (or if i use wifiradar)
2007-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	EpochWolf	Stev	do you have any ethernet cables plugged in?
2007-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	Stev		no
2007-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	Stev		not now :P
2007-08-25T05:21:00.000Z	Stev		seems that nm-applet forgets to get an ip :P
2007-08-25T05:21:00.000Z	EpochWolf	Stev	okay, then just use a different method until someone can help you fix it. It's out of my experience
2007-08-25T05:21:00.000Z	Stev	EpochWolf	ok, tnx for your time :)
2007-08-25T05:22:00.000Z	EpochWolf	Stev	no problem.
