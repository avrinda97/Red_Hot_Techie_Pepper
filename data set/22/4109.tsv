2008-09-03T12:47:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		how do i turn off this desktop type find feature.  i can't type in a password for a game because of it.
2008-09-03T12:48:00.000Z	geirha	kindofabuzz	sounds like the problem is that the game isn't grabbing keyboard focus
2008-09-03T12:48:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	geirha	yeah it's not for some reason
2008-09-03T12:49:00.000Z	geirha	kindofabuzz	is it wine?
2008-09-03T12:50:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	geirha	yeah GW under wine
2008-09-03T12:51:00.000Z	geirha	kindofabuzz	If you run winecfg and set a virtual desktop, it should get the keyboard focus, but then you can't play it in fullscreen :/
2008-09-03T12:51:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	geirha	i'll just remove tracker, i never use it anyways
2008-09-03T12:52:00.000Z	geirha	kindofabuzz	hehe, me neither, though I suspect it's not tracker, but rather nautilus that gets the keyboard focus
2008-09-03T12:53:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	geirha	so is that nautilus doing the little search box?
2008-09-03T12:54:00.000Z	geirha	kindofabuzz	Yes.
2008-09-03T12:54:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	geirha	know how to disable it by any chance?
2008-09-03T12:54:00.000Z	geirha	kindofabuzz	I doubt disabling it will make it work any better ...
2008-09-03T12:55:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	geirha	it will alow me to type in my password! =)
2008-09-03T12:56:00.000Z	geirha	kindofabuzz	No, because you are getting that search box because gw isn't grabbing the focus
2008-09-03T12:56:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	geirha	right, but if i disable it i won't have to worry about it
2008-09-03T12:57:00.000Z	geirha	kindofabuzz	well, if it's possible to disable it, you should find it under /apps/nautilus/ in «gconf-editor»
2008-09-03T12:57:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	geirha	yeah looking there now
2008-09-03T13:00:00.000Z	geirha	kindofabuzz	btw, try "Allow DirectX apps to stop the mouse leaving their window" in winecfg
2008-09-03T13:01:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	geirha	k thanks
2008-09-03T13:02:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	geirha	i think i found my problem, i had allow wm to control the window unchecked
2008-09-03T13:02:00.000Z	geirha	kindofabuzz	Ah, that also sounds like a possible fix, indeed
2008-09-03T13:03:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	geirha	yeah that was it =)
