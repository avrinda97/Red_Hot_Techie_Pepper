2007-06-26T15:58:00.000Z	crawling		listen guys: i was playing around with the live cd version of ubuntu before installing it and my sound card was working PERFECTLY , now that i have installed ubuntu on my hard drive the sound doesn't work , i searched around and my soundcard is unsupported , how can this work in the live cd version on not on the full ? anyone?
2007-06-26T15:58:00.000Z	wols_	crawling	pop in the live cd and find out
2007-06-26T15:59:00.000Z	crawling	wols_	i would do that , but i'm kind a noob in linux -.-'
2007-06-26T16:00:00.000Z	crawling	wols_	but can you explain how can an unsupported sound card is working on a live cd ?
2007-06-26T16:00:00.000Z	wols_	crawling	are you a noob in putting in a CD into a drive too?
2007-06-26T16:01:00.000Z	wols_	crawling	yes. user error
2007-06-26T16:05:00.000Z	crawling	wols_	forgive me if i'm beeing to noob , but how can i find out using the live cd if i'm a noob in linux?
2007-06-26T16:07:00.000Z	crawling	wols_	so?
2007-06-26T16:11:00.000Z	wols_	crawling	you stick in a CD and press the power button. you said your sound worked in the Live CD. how do you know if you haven't booted the live cd yet?
2007-06-26T16:12:00.000Z	crawling	wols_	 i'll be more direct: you want me to come here to the irc and speak with you in the live cd? and btw , stop the noobish talk about puting a cd in a drive ffs
2007-06-26T16:13:00.000Z	wols_	crawling	I simply answered your questions. how do you you ocnnect to the inernte? router with dhcp?
2007-06-26T16:14:00.000Z	crawling	wols_	yes.. btw i don't need dumb answers about the cd
2007-06-26T16:15:00.000Z	wols_	crawling	then you should have an internet connection on the CD just fine
2007-06-26T16:15:00.000Z	wols_	crawling	if you ask dumb questions....
2007-06-26T16:16:00.000Z	crawling	wols_	so..an unsupported card works on a live cd and it is UNSUPPORTED , no drivers in linux for that , how is that a dumb question? your retartd
2007-06-26T16:17:00.000Z	wols_	crawling	it's a logical impossibiltiy. ergo you are mistaken in some way or other
2007-06-26T16:17:00.000Z	wols_	crawling	but since you tell other people who try to help you they are retarded: good luck getting help from anyone unless you pay them
2007-06-26T16:18:00.000Z	crawling	wols_	well...it's not impossible , what's my gain in inventing this? you try to help saying me to put the cd in the drive and press the button and saying it's impossible?
2007-06-26T16:18:00.000Z	crawling	wols_	you're good , nice help indeed
2007-06-26T16:18:00.000Z	wols_	crawling	go away. annoy someone else troll
2007-06-26T16:19:00.000Z	crawling	wols_	see? your retarded ffs
2007-06-26T16:23:00.000Z	crawling	wols_	you told to put the cd , not to search for modules , and i say i was noob in linux
