2009-05-04T21:13:00.000Z	maria__		Ademan....wlan0     unknown bit-rate information.
2009-05-04T21:13:00.000Z	maria__		          Current Bit Rate=11 Mb/s
2009-05-04T21:13:00.000Z	maria__		Ademan...i set the bitrate manually.  Everytime I boot it is set to 1Mbit.
2009-05-04T21:14:00.000Z	maria__		Ademan....but I fixed that in the etc/network/network file
2009-05-04T21:15:00.000Z	maria__		Ademan...so the NIC *thinks* that it is set to 11Mbit.  How do I tell if the router is transmitting at least that much?  I read somewhere that encryption like WPA slows bitrates?  Anythoughts?
2009-05-04T21:16:00.000Z	maria__		Ademan...is this useful information.....product: Wireless PCI Adapter RT2400 / RT2460

2009-05-04T21:18:00.000Z	rxMokka	maria__	that 11mbit is connection-speed rating, not what you're actually pushing through with network data. encryption/authentication should not affect that number. if you're not running at the connection-speed rating that you expect, its most likely a signal strength/orientation or interfeerance issue
2009-05-04T21:20:00.000Z	rxMokka	maria__	winXP lies, 16mbit is not a valid connection rating afaik
2009-05-04T21:20:00.000Z	rxMokka	maria__	next valid rating after 11 is 54 I believe
2009-05-04T21:21:00.000Z	rxMokka	maria__	oh, you are getting 1mbit? I thought you said you had 11
2009-05-04T21:23:00.000Z	rxMokka	maria__	are you talking aobut 16m of file transfer rate between wired PC's within your lan?
2009-05-04T21:25:00.000Z	rxMokka	maria__	bt not going to work as well over wifi, and in general is an instable benchmark for testing network speed
2009-05-04T21:25:00.000Z	rxMokka	maria__	bt has too many simultaneous connections for wifi to perform as well as wired
2009-05-04T21:26:00.000Z	rxMokka	maria__	I would use internal-testing to benchmark your wifi's capabilities
2009-05-04T21:27:00.000Z	rxMokka	maria__	check kismet for any interfeering channels or devices
2009-05-04T21:27:00.000Z	rxMokka	maria__	set your AP to use _only_ the highest speed revision that your hardware supports (G or N Only, for example)
2009-05-04T21:28:00.000Z	rxMokka	maria__	test with WPA disabled and verify that you can connect with G-only mode or b-only, whatever you support at a max
2009-05-04T21:29:00.000Z	rxMokka	maria__	if you can't achieve that connectevity, I'd re-verify that you're using the most-capable driver in ubuntu
2009-05-04T21:30:00.000Z	rxMokka	maria__	most _capable_ ;)
2009-05-04T21:30:00.000Z	rxMokka	maria__	youd have to findout what driver is compatible, then install the newest version
2009-05-04T21:30:00.000Z	rxMokka	maria__	I can help you later with wifi-specifics if you want to look me up in #fluxbuntu
