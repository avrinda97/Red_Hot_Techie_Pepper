2005-07-26T09:01:00.000Z	Sponge_	DAC1138	Ur kiddin'? no way!
2005-07-26T09:01:00.000Z	DAC1138	Sponge_	yeah, i gave up installing it. that progress bar was crawling
2005-07-26T09:01:00.000Z	DAC1138	Sponge_	when it said "15 minutes remaining ir really meant "15 hours remaining"
2005-07-26T09:02:00.000Z	Sponge_	DAC1138	hahaha... I haven't tryed the winxp installation yet. Just win98.
2005-07-26T09:02:00.000Z	DAC1138	Sponge_	xp installed fine, in about 30 minutes on another laptop thats about half as fast as this one
2005-07-26T09:02:00.000Z	DAC1138	Sponge_	this is a 2.2 ghz with 768 mb ram, that thing is a 1.1 ghz with 512, i have no idea what happened to make it so slow
2005-07-26T09:03:00.000Z	Sponge_	DAC1138	Whoa... My desk is a 1.8 ghz / 768 mb ram... and It really works!
