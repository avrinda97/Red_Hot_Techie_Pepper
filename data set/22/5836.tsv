2007-07-15T14:14:00.000Z	crolle17		  If you installed it from the VMware website, please remove it by running  
2007-07-15T14:14:00.000Z	crolle17		  vmware-uninstall.pl before proceeding.

2007-07-15T14:14:00.000Z	crolle17		  If it was installed through Ubuntu, you must purge (completely remove)    
2007-07-15T14:14:00.000Z	crolle17		  the old package.
2007-07-15T14:14:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	crolle17	use pastebin
2007-07-15T14:15:00.000Z	crolle17	Paddy_EIRE	sorry.
2007-07-20T14:28:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	crolle17	different kettle of fish
2007-08-08T12:37:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	crolle17	one of the best available
2007-08-08T12:38:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	crolle17	although SMPlayer is a better front end
2007-08-08T12:39:00.000Z	crolle17	Paddy_EIRE	the smplayer (really smplayer??) is not found with my sources.list
2007-08-08T12:39:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	crolle17	it aint in the ubuntu repos
2007-08-08T12:40:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	crolle17	get it here ---> http://www.getdeb.net/app.php?name=SMPlayer
2007-08-08T12:40:00.000Z	crolle17	Paddy_EIRE	alright. but i have another question. which package to install for playing mp3 (especially in webpages - is there maybe a mozilla-plugin available for playing mp3 in the browser??)
2007-08-08T12:40:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	crolle17	example please
2007-08-08T12:41:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	crolle17	also 'mozilla-mplayer' is great for all that kind of stuff
2007-08-08T12:41:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	crolle17	do you have the restricted codecs installed
2007-08-08T12:41:00.000Z	crolle17	Paddy_EIRE	no. mozilla-mplayer is playing mp3?
2007-08-08T12:42:00.000Z	crolle17	Paddy_EIRE	i do need the restricted codecs also for playing mp3 with mozilla-mplayer?
2007-08-08T12:43:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	crolle17	of course why would you not
