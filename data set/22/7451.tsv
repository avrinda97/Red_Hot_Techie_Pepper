2006-04-08T10:33:00.000Z	neurosis		is there a command line that lists packages that need upgraded ?
2006-04-08T10:35:00.000Z	DBO	neurosis	i suppose you could do "sudo apt-get -s upgrade" which will simulate an upgrade but not actually do it, then you could see what it simulated...
2006-04-11T10:18:00.000Z	neurosis	DBO	is nessus more thurough than nmap?
2006-04-11T10:06:00.000Z	DBO	neurosis	yes
2006-04-11T10:06:00.000Z	DBO	neurosis	do you feel you need it?
2006-04-11T10:06:00.000Z	neurosis	DBO	is it good security software?
2006-04-11T10:06:00.000Z	neurosis	DBO	more or less im looking to learn to secure linux
2006-04-11T10:07:00.000Z	DBO	neurosis	its not software per say, its just a script to help harden your system.  If your system is running in a high risc area, it is a good idea to run it, and you will learn some stuff
2006-04-11T10:07:00.000Z	neurosis	DBO	im not really running a server or anything and i wouldnt say insecure, but i would like to use it as a learning tool if possible
2006-04-11T10:08:00.000Z	DBO	neurosis	it wont tell you EXACTLY what its doing (like what command it executes), but it asks questions and gives you a general feel of what its doing
2006-04-11T10:08:00.000Z	DBO	neurosis	if you are looking for security holes on your system, get nessus (CAUTION, running a nessus scan over the internet is a crime)
2006-04-11T10:09:00.000Z	neurosis	DBO	dont you have to pay for nessus?
2006-04-11T10:09:00.000Z	DBO	neurosis	not for personal use
2006-04-11T10:09:00.000Z	neurosis	DBO	thanks
2006-04-11T10:09:00.000Z	DBO	neurosis	bastille linux is a good idea, learn how to chroot stuff too, chroot is one of your best tools for securing applications on your box
2006-04-11T10:10:00.000Z	neurosis	DBO	ive been planning on learning chroot. I will be reading up on it soon
2006-04-11T10:10:00.000Z	DBO	neurosis	one last thing, bastille linux will not work with its GUI in ubuntu (can be fixed, but not worth it), just run it in text mode
2006-04-11T10:11:00.000Z	neurosis	DBO	i ran freebsd before this and the security part was allot easier in bsd it just didnt make a very good desktop so now im trying to learn to secure linux so i dont have to worry
2006-04-11T10:12:00.000Z	DBO	neurosis	ubuntu is FAIRLY secure out of the box (minux that clear text password thing) since it doesnt have any external listening services
2006-04-11T10:12:00.000Z	neurosis	DBO	has the clear text thing been fixed? thats the root password right?
2006-04-11T10:13:00.000Z	DBO	neurosis	yes, it is one of the first patches that gets applied to your system with synaptics, it is not the root password but the password of the sudo account
2006-04-11T10:18:00.000Z	DBO	neurosis	much more
