2012-07-03T06:15:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	icecube45	"sudo iptables -L" will tell you if iptables is set to block anything
2012-07-03T06:19:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	icecube45	"sudo iptables -L" will tell you if iptables is set to block anything
2012-07-03T06:19:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	icecube45	ah, your router may have an adaptive firewall. If it detected an IP was spamming, scanning or brute forcing, it may have black-listed it.
2012-07-03T06:30:00.000Z	icecube45	DarwinSurvivor	please repeat that iptables command, i missed it
2012-07-03T06:30:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	icecube45	sudo iptables --flush
2012-07-03T06:31:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	icecube45	run gufw and it should re-enable it.
2012-07-03T06:32:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	icecube45	is there any particular reason you are using DMZ, or is it just for testing/debugging?
2012-07-03T06:35:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	icecube45	"-F" is the same as "--flush"
2012-07-03T06:37:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	icecube45	and can you confirm that "sudo iptables -L" no looks like http://paste.ubuntu.com/1072408/
2012-07-03T06:38:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	icecube45	"sudo iptables -L" to see the current settings, "sudo iptables -F" to disable all the rule.
2012-07-03T06:42:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	icecube45	yes
2012-07-03T06:43:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	icecube45	do you have a text editor or something you can copy-paste them into to save?
