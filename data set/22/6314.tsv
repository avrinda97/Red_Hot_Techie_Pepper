2007-03-08T08:37:00.000Z	abasinisvacant		"i am not the owner, so i can not change these permissions", that's what it says when i try to delete a certain file.  i i am the root user, but why can't i delete it still? is ther a way??
2007-03-08T08:37:00.000Z	PriceChild	abasinisvacant	the root account is disabled by default in ubuntu. The first user is not a root user, however you can prefix commands with "sudo" to give it root privileges
2007-03-08T08:38:00.000Z	PriceChild	abasinisvacant	prefix the command with "sudo", so for example "sudo gedit foo" or "sudo rm foo"
2007-03-08T08:40:00.000Z	PriceChild	abasinisvacant	The command you were attempting earlier, put a sudo before it. My examples were just examples... you weren't meant to do them
2007-03-08T08:42:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	PriceChild	the page is still blank
2007-03-08T08:42:00.000Z	PriceChild	abasinisvacant	What were you trying to do originally?
2007-03-08T08:43:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	PriceChild	 originally i was trying to install a korean version of firefox
2007-03-08T08:43:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	PriceChild	then there was an error in installing, and now my english firefox is broken also
2007-03-08T08:44:00.000Z	PriceChild	abasinisvacant	"that's what it says when i try to delete a certain file." is what the original problem was... Hmm... I'm not too sure about what you're trying to do now...
2007-03-08T08:45:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	PriceChild	i'm trying to get rid of something called "lock", because it seems that it's preventing me from uninstalling (or reinstalling)the bad firefox file
2007-03-08T08:45:00.000Z	PriceChild	abasinisvacant	How did you install this "bad firefox"?
2007-03-08T08:45:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	PriceChild	synaptic package
2007-03-08T08:45:00.000Z	PriceChild	abasinisvacant	So why wouldn't synaptic remove it?
2007-03-08T08:45:00.000Z	PriceChild	abasinisvacant	what's the name of the package?
2007-03-08T08:46:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	PriceChild	mozilla-firefox-locale-ko
2007-03-08T08:47:00.000Z	PriceChild	abasinisvacant	"sudo apt-get -f install" Will fix things I think...
2007-03-08T08:47:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	PriceChild	ok will try..
2007-03-08T08:49:00.000Z	PriceChild	abasinisvacant	close synaptic or any other package managers then try again
2007-03-08T08:52:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	PriceChild	it says :  E:  unmet dependencies.  Try 'apt-get -f install; with no packages (or specify a solution).
2007-03-08T08:53:00.000Z	PriceChild	abasinisvacant	"sudo apt-get remove mozilla-firefox-locale-ko" ?
2007-03-28T13:41:00.000Z	PriceChild	abasinisvacant	sudo is a security feature. root is disabled in ubuntu as a security feature.
2007-03-28T13:41:00.000Z	PriceChild	abasinisvacant	anyone/any guide that tells you to use a root session instead of sudo is wrong or broken.
