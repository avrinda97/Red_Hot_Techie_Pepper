2009-05-09T08:31:00.000Z	xrfang		hello, in ubuntu 9.04 I cannot use my external usb cdrom, any idea please?
2009-05-09T08:31:00.000Z	vertagano	xrfang	When you say you can't use it, do you mean that you can't see it, or you can't open media...?
2009-05-09T08:32:00.000Z	xrfang	vertagano	it does not recognize the device, it seems,
2009-05-09T08:32:00.000Z	xrfang		I can post dmesg, if you like?
2009-05-09T08:32:00.000Z	vertagano	xrfang	Does it show up when you run lsusb ?
2009-05-09T08:32:00.000Z	xrfang		in MDV or my previous (k)ubuntu installation it is ok
2009-05-09T08:32:00.000Z	xrfang		I will try now
2009-05-09T08:33:00.000Z	xrfang	vertagano	seems not
2009-05-09T08:33:00.000Z	xrfang		here is the logs:

2009-05-09T08:33:00.000Z	xrfang		ok, thanks one moment
2009-05-09T08:34:00.000Z	vertagano	xrfang	If you unplug the device and run lsusb again, which lines disappear (if any)?
2009-05-09T08:34:00.000Z	xrfang	vertagano	NONE disappeared.
2009-05-09T08:35:00.000Z	vertagano	xrfang	Can you switch where you're plugging it in with a currenlty working USB device?
2009-05-09T08:36:00.000Z	xrfang	vertagano	I changed my mouse to that port, it seems ok
2009-05-09T08:37:00.000Z	vertagano	xrfang	And you said this drive works with other OSes, right? What's the model of the drive?
2009-05-09T08:37:00.000Z	xrfang	vertagano	STRANGE, i plugged in the drive in the port I usually use mouse, now it is recognized
