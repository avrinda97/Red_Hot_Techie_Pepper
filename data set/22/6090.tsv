2007-07-29T15:33:00.000Z	Pricey	BENN92647	have you read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WorldofWarcraft ?
2007-07-29T15:35:00.000Z	Pricey	BENN92647	I don't know where it says anything about dekstop/wowfolder ...
2007-07-29T15:36:00.000Z	Pricey	BENN92647	ok cli tips...
2007-07-29T15:36:00.000Z	Pricey	BENN92647	firstly... / is your root. If you want to start frmo where you are currently, don't use it... so cd desktop/wowfolder/foo
2007-07-29T15:36:00.000Z	Pricey	BENN92647	secondly... linux is case sensitive, so use capital D for desktop
2007-07-29T15:39:00.000Z	Pricey	BENN92647	No it really isn't :)
2007-07-29T15:39:00.000Z	Pricey	BENN92647	also you might want to utilse "tab completion"...
2007-07-29T15:40:00.000Z	Pricey	BENN92647	type cd Des<tab>
2007-07-29T15:40:00.000Z	Pricey	BENN92647	and it should fill out the rest of it
2007-07-29T15:40:00.000Z	Pricey	BENN92647	wine is command line only... it doesn't have a gui
2007-07-29T15:40:00.000Z	Pricey	BENN92647	just follow the amazing guide that you are extremely lucky for me to have given you gratis
