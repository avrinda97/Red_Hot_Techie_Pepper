2008-05-04T07:28:00.000Z	mike_e		I have a serious problem with my hard drive, I'm using a liveCD and it won't detect my hard drive or any partitions
2008-05-04T07:29:00.000Z	mike_e		I'm not sure, how would I know if it was dead?
2008-05-04T07:29:00.000Z	mike_e		when my computer crashed a few weeks ago
2008-05-04T07:29:00.000Z	mike_e		and I booted with the liveCD, it still had all of my files
2008-05-04T07:29:00.000Z	mike_e		then I tried installing
2008-05-04T07:29:00.000Z	mike_e		and it erased everything that was on my hard drive
2008-05-04T07:30:00.000Z	mike_e		I don't care to recorver my files, I care to install ubuntu
