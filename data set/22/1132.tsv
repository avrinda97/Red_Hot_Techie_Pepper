2010-09-21T01:36:00.000Z	DARUDE		alright I fixed my wireless card
2010-09-21T01:36:00.000Z	DARUDE		woopee
2010-09-21T01:37:00.000Z	DARUDE		Now does anyone know an alternative for Flash Player on ubuntu? because I am trying to watch videos in fullscreen but lags horribly
2010-09-21T01:37:00.000Z	jrib	DARUDE	what arch?
2010-09-21T01:37:00.000Z	DARUDE	jrib	what's that
2010-09-21T01:37:00.000Z	jrib	DARUDE	32bit or 64bit?
2010-09-21T01:38:00.000Z	jrib	DARUDE	if you're using npviewer try using instead the native 64bit plugin from adobe they released a few days ago
2010-09-21T01:38:00.000Z	DARUDE	jrib	to be honest I don't know what I am using
2010-09-21T01:38:00.000Z	jrib	DARUDE	apt-cache policy nspluginwrapper
2010-09-21T01:39:00.000Z	DARUDE	jrib	ok
2010-09-21T01:39:00.000Z	jrib	DARUDE	that's just to get information for me
2010-09-21T01:40:00.000Z	jrib	DARUDE	that means you're using npviewer
2010-09-21T01:41:00.000Z	jrib	DARUDE	yes, do the following: 1) sudo aptitude purge flashplugin-installer 2) go to http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html and download the tar.gz for 64-bit 3) extract the libflashplayer.so to ~/.mozilla/plugins
2010-09-21T01:41:00.000Z	jrib	DARUDE	this means however it will be up to you to maintain it and keep it up to date (for security issues, etc) as with all software installed outside the repositories
2010-09-21T01:47:00.000Z	jrib	DARUDE	~ means /home/YOUR_USERNAME usually.  Directories that start with a '.' like ".mozilla" are hidden by default.  You can show hidden directories in nautilus by either pressing ctrl-h or going to view â†’ show hidden files.  If you do not have a ~/.mozilla/plugins, create it
2010-09-21T01:52:00.000Z	DARUDE	jrib	After placing the 'libflashplayer.so' in ~/.mozilla/plugins/ I re-opened my Firefox and tried to watch a video but it prompted me that I am 'Missing Plugins".
2010-09-21T01:53:00.000Z	DARUDE	jrib	Nevermind sir.
2010-09-21T01:53:00.000Z	jrib	DARUDE	close fir... ok :)
2010-09-21T01:53:00.000Z	DARUDE	jrib	I refreshed the page and it appeared.
2010-09-21T01:54:00.000Z	DARUDE	jrib	Thank you very much.
2010-09-21T01:54:00.000Z	jrib	DARUDE	no problem, is the performance actually better?
2010-09-21T01:54:00.000Z	DARUDE	jrib	Much much better.
