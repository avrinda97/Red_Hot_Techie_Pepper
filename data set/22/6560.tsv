2008-03-31T17:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis		heh
2008-03-31T17:20:00.000Z	compwiz18	Dr_willis	I'm like, there's an Ubuntu+2? :P
2008-03-31T17:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	compwiz18	 thats for discussion of "incontinent ibex"
2008-03-31T17:21:00.000Z	compwiz18	Dr_willis	it forwards to #ubuntu+1 atm apparently
2008-03-31T17:32:00.000Z	compwiz18	Dr_willis	do you use bash, or zsh, or something else?
2008-03-31T17:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	compwiz18	 i use bash
2008-03-31T17:33:00.000Z	compwiz18	Dr_willis	just curious - I noticed you put the ' ' around the IP
2008-03-31T17:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	compwiz18	 nmap can handle the wildcards itself. :)
2008-03-31T17:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	compwiz18	 without the '' bash would also.
2008-03-31T17:34:00.000Z	compwiz18	Dr_willis	I know, but ZSH thinks it can too, which it doesn't liek
2008-03-31T17:34:00.000Z	compwiz18	Dr_willis	I'm not having to in bash
2008-03-31T17:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	compwiz18	 i imagine zsh has some quoteing to get around it also.
2008-03-31T17:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	compwiz18	 i can think of 2 programs i normally use  the '*' stuff.. one is nmap, other is unzip
2008-03-31T17:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	compwiz18	 do a 'touch 192.168.1.fppppppppppppppppppp' THEN   nmap -sP 192.168.1.* vs   nmap -sP '192.168.1.*'
2008-03-31T17:40:00.000Z	compwiz18	Dr_willis	ah, so that's the difference :)
2008-03-31T17:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	compwiz18	 i seem to have to quote it in both shells..:)
2008-03-31T17:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	compwiz18	 unless you were in an empty directory perhaps
2008-03-31T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	compwiz18	 in an empty dir. with bash  nmap -sP 192.168.1.* works. :)
2008-03-31T17:41:00.000Z	compwiz18	Dr_willis	yes, mine works in bash so long as there is no 10.0.1.* matches
2008-03-31T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	compwiz18	 thats the diff. no matches. bash sends the whole * string, zsh must do it differently
2008-03-31T17:42:00.000Z	compwiz18	Dr_willis	zsh apparently tries to expand it regardless, and then dies if it can't
2008-03-31T17:42:00.000Z	compwiz18	Dr_willis	I did, it was pretty nice
