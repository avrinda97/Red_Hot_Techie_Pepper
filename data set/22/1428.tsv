2010-05-21T23:16:00.000Z	soreau		How can I see how much ram a machine has through the cli?
2010-05-21T23:16:00.000Z	a3ist	soreau	 "free" in console.  But look at the buffers for a better idea
2010-05-21T23:17:00.000Z	a3ist	soreau	just keep in mind that the first line of "free" is deceiving; if it seems like most of the ram is "used" on the first line that's normal
2010-05-21T23:18:00.000Z	soreau	a3ist	well it says 371 total, so I assume that's MB
2010-05-21T23:19:00.000Z	a3ist	soreau	check "man free" and you can see how to use options for different units of measurement
2010-05-21T23:27:00.000Z	soreau	a3ist	Oh I'm sure, free -m outputs in mb by default :D
2010-05-21T23:20:00.000Z	a3ist	soreau	the default is in kilobytes
2010-05-21T23:21:00.000Z	soreau	a3ist	That doesn't sound right..
2010-05-21T23:21:00.000Z	a3ist	soreau	do a !pastebin of your output from "free" and I can take a look
2010-05-21T23:22:00.000Z	soreau	a3ist	Judging by running the output of free on a machine where I know what the memory size is, the default is indeed mb
2010-05-21T23:23:00.000Z	a3ist	soreau	it might be possible that an alias is set somewhere in your settings to make it show mb by default; the original functionality is for kb with options in place for mb and gb
2010-05-21T23:24:00.000Z	a3ist	soreau	this is copy/pasted from the man page for "free"......"The -b switch displays the amount of memory in bytes; the -k switch (set by default) displays  it  in  kilobytes;  the  -m  switch  displays  it  in megabytes; the -g switch displays it in gigabytes."
2010-05-21T23:25:00.000Z	soreau	a3ist	I thought you were the one that said free -m, because that is the command I have been using
2010-05-21T23:26:00.000Z	a3ist	soreau	no worries.  When in doubt, the man pages are usually the best reference.
2010-05-21T23:27:00.000Z	soreau	a3ist	Right, but how do you find a man page for some program that tells you how much memory your machine has when you don't know about free? ;)
2010-05-21T23:27:00.000Z	a3ist	soreau	I didn't mean originally; I meant when you were unsure about the format :)
2010-05-21T23:29:00.000Z	a3ist	soreau	the only reason I piped up originally was to clarify about the output from "free" being deceiving without context; a lot of people see the first line and think that most of their memory is being wasted, when in fact its just being delegated for access via buffers, and the buffer line gives a better idea of what's being actively used and what's free.
2010-05-21T23:30:00.000Z	a3ist	soreau	its just a habit of mine to offer clarifications to potentially confusing or ambiguous situations or advice.
2010-05-21T23:30:00.000Z	soreau	a3ist	Well most people are idiots, so I see where you're coming from ;)
2010-05-21T23:30:00.000Z	soreau	a3ist	The output was very clear to me
2010-05-21T23:31:00.000Z	a3ist	soreau	well I wouldn't put it quite like that :)  But the general level of experience with the CLI among new ubuntu users is often kinda basic, so I just err on the side of caution.
2010-05-21T23:32:00.000Z	a3ist	soreau	IdleOne, don't worry about it; he wasn't insulting me specifically.  No harm no foul.
