2012-09-22T04:00:00.000Z	blackshirt		matt_9118, is that module available on repository?
2012-09-22T04:01:00.000Z	bekks	blackshirt	No, since it has to be compiled.
2012-09-22T04:02:00.000Z	blackshirt	bekks	is that module support for dkms?
2012-09-22T04:02:00.000Z	bekks	blackshirt	dkms has nothing to do with it.
2012-09-22T04:03:00.000Z	blackshirt	bekks	i think like that too
2012-09-22T04:04:00.000Z	bekks	blackshirt	Take a look here to get an impression for whats that module is used: http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/zd1211rw
2012-09-22T04:05:00.000Z	blackshirt	bekks	i think there are some readme/install file contains instructions how to build the module
2012-10-20T11:50:00.000Z	bekks	blackshirt	Please stop it.
2012-10-21T13:51:00.000Z	bekks	blackshirt	Whats "console single mode"?
2012-10-21T13:52:00.000Z	bekks	blackshirt	Since upstart, there is no single mode anymore.
2012-10-21T13:53:00.000Z	bekks	blackshirt	GUI has nothing to do with it :)
2012-10-21T13:58:00.000Z	bekks	blackshirt	Upgrading in the GUI has no higher chance of breaking things.
2012-10-21T14:01:00.000Z	blackshirt	bekks	with more a lot of packages installed, more bigger chance...thats why i'm said
2012-10-21T14:01:00.000Z	bekks	blackshirt	"more package installed" has nothing to do with "upgrading in the gui".
2012-10-21T14:02:00.000Z	bekks	blackshirt	You can have very few packages even with a GUI - and quite a lot packages without a GUI.
2012-10-21T14:03:00.000Z	blackshirt	bekks	yes i know this .... Thats very common system with gui has more packages installed
2012-11-01T16:22:00.000Z	blackshirt	bekks	how to list of people on channel in irssi ?
2012-11-01T16:22:00.000Z	bekks	blackshirt	"/names"
2012-11-04T13:39:00.000Z	blackshirt	bekks	just tell the grub not loading second one
2012-11-04T13:39:00.000Z	blackshirt	bekks	sorry for worng notice
2012-11-04T13:40:00.000Z	bekks	blackshirt	Thats not that easy. Because when you delete the second one, and you delete the /boot that grub relies on, you get a broken system.
2012-11-04T13:40:00.000Z	bekks	blackshirt	Fekkuo: Thats why I said to properly install a boot loader from the first one.
