2012-02-05T11:09:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna		What is the best way to install beta nvidia drivers? (e.g. which ppa to choose)
2012-02-05T11:10:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna		hmm
2012-02-05T11:10:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna		I think nvidia supplies a horribly ugly script
2012-02-05T11:11:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna		a ppa is *much* nicer
2012-02-05T11:11:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna		I just need nvidia 290.* until it his stable
2012-02-05T11:11:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna		there's a bug in previous versions that prevents booting
2012-02-05T11:13:00.000Z	frybye	Shirakawasuna	I have tried again and again to get a GT240 to work - are you saying I need a beta nvidia linux driver or?
2012-02-05T11:14:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	frybye	Not necessarily. My issue only affects Geforce 9300 IGP cards
2012-02-05T11:15:00.000Z	frybye	Shirakawasuna	well I will perhaps give it a go
2012-02-05T11:26:00.000Z	frybye	Shirakawasuna	how to install the nvidia 290 with a *.run file ending - Ubuntu 11.10 tries to open it in gedit!!??
2012-02-05T11:27:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	frybye	gotta use the command line
2012-02-05T11:27:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	frybye	be careful with this stuff - it's powerful
2012-02-05T11:27:00.000Z	frybye	Shirakawasuna	what would be the command??
2012-02-05T11:28:00.000Z	frybye	Shirakawasuna	in the gui I have selected "run as programme?" right?
2012-02-05T11:29:00.000Z	frybye	Shirakawasuna	I am a veteran with damaged memory - can you remind me of the command to run this in terminal...?
2012-02-05T11:30:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	frybye	open a terminal, then go to the directory with the file (cd /path/to/file). To run it, type ./nvidia-whatever-etc-etc-.run. If this doesn't work, make it executable using chmod +x
2012-02-05T11:32:00.000Z	frybye	Shirakawasuna	gave error - must be run as root - ??
2012-02-05T11:35:00.000Z	frybye	Shirakawasuna	back to problem one - it says there is no supported nvidia card in the pc - i know that cos if I put the gt240 in the screen is unusable...
2012-02-05T11:35:00.000Z	frybye	Shirakawasuna	like a chicken and egg problem.. card with no driver not screen - driver with no card not installable???
2012-02-05T11:37:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	frybye	when you download the nvidia installer, you have to make sure you get the right one. You may have accidentally downloaded the wrong one.
2012-02-05T11:37:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	frybye	e.g. I know that my card is the geforce 9 series 9300 (ion) card
2012-02-05T11:38:00.000Z	frybye	Shirakawasuna	I got the linux driver for the gt240 direct from nvidia - the installer seems to work except it complains the card is not in...
