2007-04-18T13:56:00.000Z	Seraphire		Question then:  I have someone that's trying dictionary attacks against my Ubuntu box.  Is there a way I can configure SSH so that it not let someone continue to try and log into my box after a certain number of failures?
2007-04-18T13:56:00.000Z	jrib	Seraphire	look into denyhosts
2007-04-18T13:57:00.000Z	Seraphire	jrib	rycuda, WaxyFresh: I'll look does that just do a specific IP or a policy?
2007-04-18T14:21:00.000Z	jrib	Seraphire	what version of ubuntu?
2007-04-18T14:21:00.000Z	Seraphire	jrib	 2.6.15-28-server
2007-04-18T14:21:00.000Z	jrib	Seraphire	is that dapper?
2007-04-18T14:22:00.000Z	Seraphire	jrib	I think so. It's the latest stable server version.
2007-04-18T14:22:00.000Z	Seraphire	jrib	I installed it only about 2 weeks ago.
2007-04-18T14:22:00.000Z	jrib	Seraphire	lsb_release -a
2007-04-18T14:22:00.000Z	jrib	Seraphire	in a shell
2007-04-18T14:23:00.000Z	Seraphire	jrib	Sorry, Copy and paste.  Yes, Dapper 6.06
2007-04-18T14:23:00.000Z	Seraphire	jrib	Description:    Ubuntu 6.06.1 LTS
2007-04-18T14:23:00.000Z	jrib	Seraphire	hmm denyhosts was only pacakged in edgy
2007-04-18T14:24:00.000Z	Seraphire	jrib	Is there a Ubuntu list I can check for this? I've only see the packages.debian.org
2007-04-18T14:24:00.000Z	jrib	Seraphire	well you should just use apt-cache search, but ubuntu has packages.ubuntu.com
2007-04-18T14:25:00.000Z	Seraphire	jrib	okay. I tried the apt-cache and I don't see it.  I've added the universe and the multiverse
2007-04-18T14:26:00.000Z	jrib	Seraphire	right, because denyhosts is not packaged in dapper.  Only edgy.  Grab denyhosts from the sourceforge page, it's a python script, so it should be relatively painless
2007-04-18T14:26:00.000Z	Seraphire	jrib	Oh, okay. Can I not grab the package from the debian package site and install it with an installer? Just the manual install?
2007-04-18T14:27:00.000Z	jrib	Seraphire	it may not work.  I know that the feisty and edgy packages for denyhosts are not compatible for example
2007-04-18T14:28:00.000Z	Seraphire	jrib	Okay. I'll just grab the manual install and do it from SF.
2007-04-18T14:28:00.000Z	Seraphire	jrib	Thank you very much for the help.
2007-04-18T14:28:00.000Z	jrib	Seraphire	yw
