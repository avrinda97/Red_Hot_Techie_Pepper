2009-06-02T10:25:00.000Z	opop	Erynn	sounds like a driver issue.
2009-06-02T10:25:00.000Z	Erynn	opop	that's what I thought, but I have no idea what driver to get. How do I find my chipset?
2009-06-02T10:26:00.000Z	opop	Erynn	then pastebin the results, pls
2009-06-02T10:28:00.000Z	opop	Erynn	plus you're probably using wpa_supplicant, which is fine, but doesn't support same iwconfig command-line

2009-06-02T10:29:00.000Z	opop	Erynn	this line is interesting.  eth1: could not initialize WEP: load module lbm_cw-lib80211_crypt_wep
2009-06-02T10:30:00.000Z	opop	Erynn	that's what happened when you gave it the key.
2009-06-02T10:30:00.000Z	opop	Erynn	why are you going command-line
2009-06-02T10:30:00.000Z	Erynn	opop	I meant to write your name there, haha
2009-06-02T10:30:00.000Z	Erynn	opop	tiyowan was helping me
2009-06-02T10:30:00.000Z	opop	Erynn	are you going for no gui laptop?
2009-06-02T10:31:00.000Z	Erynn	opop	no, I also use Wicd
2009-06-02T10:31:00.000Z	opop	Erynn	i think mebbe tiyowan was right.  do an $ ifconfig -a and tell me if you see a wlan0 there
2009-06-02T10:32:00.000Z	Erynn	opop	I don't! That IS weird actually because I think I used to have that...
2009-06-02T10:32:00.000Z	opop	Erynn	lyle.  mebbe the module isn't loading.
2009-06-02T10:33:00.000Z	opop	Erynn	now the stakes are higher.
2009-06-02T10:34:00.000Z	opop	Erynn	pastebin $ lspci -vv and $ lsusb -vv

2009-06-02T10:38:00.000Z	opop	Erynn	I am.  I spent a day trying to figure out why my hard drive wasn't recognized when it wasn't plugged in.
2009-06-02T10:38:00.000Z	opop	Erynn	sometimes it's the dumbest stuff.
2009-06-02T10:38:00.000Z	Erynn	opop	Haha well we all have our off days. I'm kind of hoping this has a simple solution...
2009-06-02T10:43:00.000Z	opop	Erynn	noice.
