2012-09-27T18:21:00.000Z	blackshirt	e66	your pastebin says, there are two version of libboost available ...
2012-09-27T18:22:00.000Z	e66	blackshirt	But its normal as i see many packages have many versions in the repo. It should be okay.
2012-09-27T18:23:00.000Z	blackshirt	e66	okey, that was just be a problem (relative problem for new user) if trying to install the same file, look at this line : rying to overwrite '/usr/share/boostbook/dtd/1.1/boostbook.dtd', which is also in package libboost1.40-devÂ 1.40.0-4ubuntu4
2012-09-27T18:24:00.000Z	e66	blackshirt	 enter dpkg -l '*libcurl*' in your command prompt. you'll see how many versions are in repo. there should be 3
