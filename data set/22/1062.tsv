2011-05-02T17:11:00.000Z	m4k		how do I connect with windows pc with its name from ubuntu
2011-05-02T17:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	can you expand on "connect"
2011-05-02T17:13:00.000Z	m4k	ActionParsnip	actually My  SVN server is on windows machine I'm not able to checkout with pc name, and the network is using DHCP
2011-05-02T17:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	does the windows system have a firewall?
2011-05-02T17:47:00.000Z	m4k	ActionParsnip	no
2011-05-02T17:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	I'd add a resove for the name in /etc/hosts so the name resolves to the ip
2011-05-02T17:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	the hots file will make it resolve
2011-05-02T17:48:00.000Z	m4k	ActionParsnip	LAN is DHCP so ip changes every day
2011-05-02T17:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	a server on dhcp, weird
2011-05-02T17:51:00.000Z	m4k	ActionParsnip	yes will change it soon I just joined them
2011-11-26T17:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	do you mean minimal CD?
2011-11-26T17:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	minimal installs a barebones cli install and offers to install a desktop, you can alternatively install which packages you need. The normal desktop install will install all the apps which are default in an ubuntu install, less control
2011-11-26T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	I just said
2011-11-26T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	if you had some patience you would have realised
2012-01-31T18:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	the app you run to initiate tyhe installer of the OS is called ubiquity
2012-01-31T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	not sure tbh
2012-01-31T18:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	to be honest
2012-01-31T18:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	could press CTRL+ALT+F2  when the installer is running and run:  ps | less      and see what looks suspect
2012-01-31T18:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	well,   ps -ef | less
2012-01-31T18:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	when the text installer starts
2012-01-31T18:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	probably CTRL+ALT+F1 as its the alternate text installer (No X)
2012-02-07T09:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4k	you can use the minimal ISO and remaster it
