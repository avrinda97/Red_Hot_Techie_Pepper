2008-06-18T07:16:00.000Z	theFATMAN		I need some help guys, apparently photobucket.com was hacked today, and if you visited the site you saw a message from the hackers. Well, I thought it was no big deal, but the site also infected everyone with a redirect virus. Now every site I go to, once I click on a link, it redirects to the same site. I am an ubuntu user, that's why I'm asking here. How can I fix this?
2008-06-18T07:17:00.000Z	jburd	theFATMAN	Or you can see the http headers that are being passed aroud and paste it somewhere for us
2008-06-18T07:18:00.000Z	theFATMAN	jburd	whats the easiest way to do that?
2008-06-18T07:19:00.000Z	jburd	theFATMAN	Hold on.
2008-06-18T07:19:00.000Z	theFATMAN	jburd	thanks and ok
2008-06-18T07:21:00.000Z	jburd	theFATMAN	Download LiveHTTP Headers for Firefox using this command and then open the downloaded file in Firefox:
2008-06-18T07:21:00.000Z	jburd	theFATMAN	wget https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/downloads/file/28118/live_http_headers-0.14-fx+sm.xpi
2008-06-18T07:22:00.000Z	theFATMAN	jburd	ok, just a sec
2008-06-18T07:22:00.000Z	jburd	theFATMAN	That will ask you to install the addon.  If that doesn't work, you might want to drag and drop that file into the addons manager.
2008-06-18T07:22:00.000Z	jburd	theFATMAN	Also, are all your browsers affected?
2008-06-18T07:23:00.000Z	theFATMAN	jburd	yes, FF &Opera
2008-06-18T07:24:00.000Z	jburd	theFATMAN	sudo aptitude install midori.  THat browser even if it is alpha quality, should work for a while.  Even epiphany-browser (and elinks if you can use the console).
2008-06-18T07:24:00.000Z	jburd	theFATMAN	Have you also tried rm -rf ~/.opera
2008-06-18T07:24:00.000Z	theFATMAN	jburd	i wget the link, where is the file saved?
2008-06-18T07:24:00.000Z	jburd	theFATMAN	type 'pwd'  that's where.
2008-06-18T07:25:00.000Z	theFATMAN	jburd	sweet, ok, just a sec

2008-06-18T07:27:00.000Z	jburd	theFATMAN	Type   `file filename.xpi` and see for yourself.
2008-06-18T07:27:00.000Z	jburd	theFATMAN	Which version of firefox are you using?
