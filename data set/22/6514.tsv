2006-10-09T15:31:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	it would be nice if you could be more specific... you can't ping anything, you can't access any webpages?
2006-10-09T15:33:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	can you still ping your gateway, etc?
2006-10-09T15:35:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	yeah, i heard ya :P
2006-10-09T15:35:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	just a bit busy atm
2006-10-09T15:36:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	is your DNS settings in ubuntu the gateway, or an external DNS server?
2006-10-09T15:38:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	so "host google.com" or whatever just doesn't work?
2006-10-09T15:40:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	does ifdown/ifup-ing the interface fix it?
2006-10-09T15:42:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	type ifconfig
2006-10-09T15:42:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	do you see an interface which is UP and has your internal IP?
2006-10-09T15:43:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	what's it called? something like eth0, eth1?
2006-10-09T16:05:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	yes?
2006-10-09T16:06:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	yeesss, what is it?
2006-10-09T16:08:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	have you tested dns with basic things like "host google.com"?
2006-10-09T16:09:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	and that doesn't work?
2006-10-09T16:11:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	yes, sorry, i didn't understand what your last question was
2006-10-09T16:12:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	have you got the name of the interface like i was asking before?
2006-10-09T16:13:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	sorry, don't give it out publicly
2006-10-09T16:15:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	yes, did you try restarting the interface?
2006-10-09T16:15:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	and? still dns doesn't work?
2006-10-09T16:18:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	as in, it stops working when you restart, or stops when you leave it idle and come back later?
2006-10-09T16:24:00.000Z	Daverocks	nold222	k
