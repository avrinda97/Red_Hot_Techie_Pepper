2008-10-13T01:11:00.000Z	soundray	Dreamglider	any luck with the faster CPU?
2008-10-13T01:11:00.000Z	Dreamglider	soundray	yes i did get better thanks :)
2008-10-13T01:13:00.000Z	Dreamglider	soundray	it is a athlon xp 2000+ and is suppose to be 1.67GHz but it was only 1.2 so i had to fiddle around with the bios to get it up to 1.6GHz
2008-10-13T01:13:00.000Z	soundray	Dreamglider	oh, you're probably using an Athlon XP CPU on a pre-XP board
2008-10-13T01:14:00.000Z	Dreamglider	soundray	yea maybe, i dont know the mobo
2008-10-13T01:15:00.000Z	Dreamglider	soundray	i guess ill have to get a 2GHz to get the playback perfect.
2008-10-13T01:15:00.000Z	soundray	Dreamglider	what kind of video file is it?
2008-10-13T01:15:00.000Z	Dreamglider	soundray	*.avi
2008-10-13T01:17:00.000Z	Dreamglider	soundray	do you know the nominal temperature range for tyhe athlon xp2000+ ?
2008-10-13T01:17:00.000Z	soundray	Dreamglider	the Theora codecs are generally quite CPU efficient. It may be worth trying to recode a piece of your .avi to Ogg Theora and see if that plays better. You will lose a bit of quality, though
2008-10-13T01:17:00.000Z	soundray	Dreamglider	no, but that kind of info should be on the AMD web site
2008-10-13T01:18:00.000Z	soundray	Dreamglider	mind you, it's not going to mean much, as the Athlon and Athlon XP CPUs don't have an internal temperature sensor
2008-10-13T01:19:00.000Z	Dreamglider	soundray	im getting a reading of 55*C from the CPU now with no load
2008-10-13T01:19:00.000Z	soundray	Dreamglider	sounds reasonable, assuming that the sensor sits on the heatsink
2008-10-13T01:20:00.000Z	Dreamglider	soundray	 no sensor on the heatsink
2008-10-13T01:21:00.000Z	soundray	Dreamglider	if it's an onboard sensor, it'll be closer to the CPU die, so it's even better
2008-10-13T01:23:00.000Z	soundray	Dreamglider	for what it's worth, I'm running a "media centre" type machine with an Athlon CPU at 1.7 GHz at around 65 C. It's been working reliably for years, even under load (video recoding)
2008-10-13T01:26:00.000Z	soundray	Dreamglider	these CPUs don't tolerate bus overclocking too well
2008-10-13T01:28:00.000Z	soundray	Dreamglider	give it another chance with intrepid
2008-10-13T01:29:00.000Z	Dreamglider	soundray	 interpid ?
2008-10-13T01:30:00.000Z	soundray	Dreamglider	one of the objectives was to improve laptop support
2008-10-15T02:01:00.000Z	soundray	Dreamglider	have you tried 'gksudo displayconfig-gtk'?
