2011-06-19T08:49:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Nobgul-BNC	one thing that is becoming an issue on my desktop, is video playing just freezes sometimes while playback, and needs to be shutdown to restart.
2011-06-19T08:49:00.000Z	Nobgul-BNC	Trfsrfr	As long as your not having major issues with it then you should be fine. But if you jump back to 10..... lts then it should work properly
2011-06-19T08:49:00.000Z	Nobgul-BNC	Trfsrfr	Are you using the restricted drivers for your video card?
2011-06-19T08:50:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Nobgul-BNC	I cant remember, and I just put in a new video card. how do I get the info your asking for?
2011-06-19T08:56:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Nobgul-BNC	I am using a proprietary driver
2011-06-19T08:57:00.000Z	Nobgul-BNC	Trfsrfr	What viso program are you using for playback?
2011-06-19T08:58:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Nobgul-BNC	would alsa be an acceptable answer?
2011-06-19T08:58:00.000Z	Nobgul-BNC	Trfsrfr	thats accually your sound driver
2011-06-19T09:00:00.000Z	Nobgul-BNC	Trfsrfr	That is the same program i have been using for a long time. The only time i have had video lockups is when the screen was as full and the pc kicked in a screensaver.
2011-06-19T09:01:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Nobgul-BNC	the screensaver is sketchy too sometimes, but my desktop is old. Overall, i'm very happy with my recent switch to linux and ive learned a ton in the process...
2011-06-19T09:04:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Nobgul-BNC	Yes, thank you from me too!
