2007-07-27T07:39:00.000Z	pawan		such a big operating system for porn and chating
2007-07-27T07:39:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	it's for the same stuff one uses any os for
2007-07-27T10:02:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	apt-cache search ubuntu-calendar
2007-07-27T10:02:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	sorry, those are wallpapers
2007-07-30T08:13:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	put a dash in there
2007-07-30T08:34:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg , should get you back up
2007-08-01T10:09:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	don't install the gnome package; it's a debian package that's held over, and doesn't quite match ubuntu-desktop
2007-08-01T10:10:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	better question: why do you want to reinstall gnome?
2007-08-01T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	I've heard of that problem, and know there's a fix, but I don't know it; others do, ask about the white screen for more help
2007-08-09T09:31:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	in gconf-editor, /apps/nautilus/preferences, untick show_desktop (turns off backgrounds as well, iirc)
2008-01-24T08:07:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	the video will be in /tmp after you watchit
2008-03-05T10:38:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=4196754&postcount=4 claims he fixed it
2008-03-05T10:41:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	don't know :) I saw several google hits talking about time issues with error 3, that's the only one that claimed a fix
2008-04-11T07:48:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	depends on what's inside the tarball
2008-04-11T07:49:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	  sudo apt-get get install flashplugin-nonfree , that will install flash for you
2008-04-25T07:38:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	no trolling
2008-05-07T10:19:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	sudo chmod a+x nvidia*run
2008-09-18T07:23:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	~/.xchat2
2008-09-18T07:25:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	xchat2
2008-09-18T07:41:00.000Z	nickrud	pawan	cd ~/.xchat2 , that'll put you in the dir. Then any logs would be in the xchatlogs dir there
