2011-03-06T00:19:00.000Z	giiker	iamjusttesting	wird you have the right driver and only one that works with your camera, but somehow it doesn't.
2011-03-06T00:19:00.000Z	giiker	iamjusttesting	did you change USB ports?
2011-03-06T00:20:00.000Z	iamjusttesting	giiker	  leave it to me to mess it up
2011-03-06T00:21:00.000Z	giiker	iamjusttesting	there is a driver that works with your camera, not the manufacturer's, but it is already loaded, so I don know what it might be at this point.
