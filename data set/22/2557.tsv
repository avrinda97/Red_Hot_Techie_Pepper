2009-12-11T00:54:00.000Z	Callum		oh god no
2009-12-11T00:54:00.000Z	Callum		I think my filesystem just crapped out...
2009-12-11T00:54:00.000Z	Callum		Firefox just crashed, and I get filesystem reading errors when I try to login to another tty...
2009-12-11T00:54:00.000Z	Callum		WHAT THE HELL HAS HAPPENED
2009-12-11T00:56:00.000Z	Callum		so, I'm screwed, only XChat survives and I can't login to another TTY because of my screwed filesystem...
2009-12-11T00:57:00.000Z	robbmunson	Callum	contrary to your statement I dont think youre totally lost yet...always a backup plan with the live cd's :)
2009-12-11T01:00:00.000Z	robbmunson	Callum	what version of ubuntu are ya on?
2009-12-11T01:01:00.000Z	Callum	robbmunson	9.10
2009-12-11T01:02:00.000Z	robbmunson	Callum	that shouldnt matter :)
2009-12-11T01:16:00.000Z	robbmunson	Callum	fixed?
2009-12-11T01:18:00.000Z	Callum	robbmunson	in other words yes
2009-12-11T01:18:00.000Z	robbmunson	Callum	yay
2009-12-11T01:19:00.000Z	robbmunson	Callum	sometimes all it takes is nothing..(strange but its true)
2009-12-11T01:21:00.000Z	robbmunson	Callum	wont know its fixed unless you  try what you originally pulled (that SHOULDNT have blew your computers FS to pieces)
2009-12-11T01:21:00.000Z	Callum	robbmunson	it was just a Google search result =(
2009-12-11T01:22:00.000Z	robbmunson	Callum	well, go for it and try it...we're always here for ya :)
2009-12-11T01:23:00.000Z	robbmunson	Callum	I would say "issue resolved" then! :)
2009-12-11T01:24:00.000Z	robbmunson	Callum	if ever in doubt you can always force a filesystem check :)
2009-12-11T01:25:00.000Z	Callum	robbmunson	okay =P
2009-12-11T01:25:00.000Z	robbmunson	Callum	man fsck
2009-12-11T01:26:00.000Z	robbmunson	Callum	should tell you what you need to know to do it manually so that youre not surprised later on.
2009-12-11T01:27:00.000Z	robbmunson	Callum	superb idea :)
