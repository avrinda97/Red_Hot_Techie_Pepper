2007-05-19T12:17:00.000Z	FFForever		oppps plugged it in the wrong way (lol)
2007-05-19T12:18:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	ugh.
2007-05-19T12:12:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	what filesystem does your IPOD use?
2007-05-19T12:13:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	doh!
2007-05-19T12:13:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	what happens when you plug your ipod in and then view it as a volume under 'sudo fdisk -l' ?
2007-05-19T12:17:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	plug it in and it should be visible if you run 'sudo fdisk -l' underneath the terminal
2007-05-19T12:17:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	terminal is your best friend...you'll learn to use it A LOT!
2007-05-19T12:19:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	use your network manager
2007-05-19T12:19:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	use the network manager
2007-05-19T12:23:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	comment everything out but the loopback stuff and then use network manager to configure your static interface
2007-05-19T12:24:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	yes so go into network manager and statically configure your interface(s)
2007-05-19T12:25:00.000Z	FFForever	Lilacor	i am on a laptop so there is no static lol
2007-05-19T12:25:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	I'm telling you to configure it statically
2007-05-19T12:32:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	if you're telling me that since you're on a laptop you cannot configure your connection statically, I'm going to have to just say that I'm 100% that your computer is hosed or you're just plain confused.
2007-05-19T12:33:00.000Z	FFForever	Lilacor	i am always on the go, do there is no reason to tell it to preset the connection info
2007-05-19T12:34:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	edit your /etc/network/interfaces file and make sure there's nothing in terms of 'eth<x> auto' then
2007-05-19T12:34:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	then you'll have to manually bring your interfaces up and down
2007-05-19T12:35:00.000Z	FFForever	Lilacor	there is no way to just tell it to start but not dhcp?
2007-05-19T12:36:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	yes you can set a static IP on it.
2007-05-19T12:36:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	and then change it as needed
2007-06-11T09:33:00.000Z	Lilacor	FFForever	what is tsearch?
