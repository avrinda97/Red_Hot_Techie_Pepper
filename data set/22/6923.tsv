2010-08-05T06:05:00.000Z	StuckMojo		how do you get to the grub prompt in lucid when there's only one kernel?
2010-08-05T06:05:00.000Z	StuckMojo		i.e. how do you boot single user mode or not boot into x?
2010-08-05T06:05:00.000Z	StuckMojo		ah ok
2010-08-05T06:06:00.000Z	StuckMojo		i jsut upgraded a fresh install of kamic, and it locks the laptop when it loads the X driver
2010-08-05T06:06:00.000Z	StuckMojo		it was doing that on the install cd to
2010-08-05T06:06:00.000Z	StuckMojo		too
2010-08-05T06:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StuckMojo	 and your video card is a?
2010-08-05T06:06:00.000Z	StuckMojo	Dr_Willis	it's intel graphics i believe
2010-08-05T06:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StuckMojo	 ubuntu dosent do it that way
2010-08-05T06:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StuckMojo	 there is a 'text' option to tell the system to not start X and disables the fancy plymouth and other eye candys at boot.
2010-08-05T06:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StuckMojo	 go back to linux 1.0 ? :)
2010-08-05T06:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StuckMojo	 upstart seems to work decently well. not very wacky at all.  Compared to the sysv..
2010-08-05T06:16:00.000Z	StuckMojo	Dr_Willis	lenny still uses sysv init
2010-08-05T06:16:00.000Z	StuckMojo	Dr_Willis	upstart is different from insserv?
2010-08-05T06:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StuckMojo	 most of the sysv stuff works with upstart.. but its mainly from upstart 'seeing/doing the right thing' for sysv scripts
2010-08-05T06:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StuckMojo	 ive never heard of innserv.
2010-08-05T06:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StuckMojo	 init.d is not used by upstart, /etc/init is.
2010-08-05T06:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StuckMojo	 ive not heard of them switching.. but i think some other disrtos have
2010-08-05T06:18:00.000Z	StuckMojo	Dr_Willis	they definately did in side
2010-08-05T06:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StuckMojo	got unstuck. :)
2010-08-05T06:20:00.000Z	StuckMojo	Dr_Willis	for some reason any time i join #debian now, it kicks me off of freenode completely ;)
2010-08-05T06:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StuckMojo	 they hate ubuntu that much? :)
