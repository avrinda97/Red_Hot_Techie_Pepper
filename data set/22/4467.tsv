2010-02-04T16:28:00.000Z	ksbalaji		I had ff 3.5.0 stable version. Enthused by its stability, I ventured to install 3.6.2pre.. I did this after I included lines deb-src and deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-mozilla-daily/ppa/ubuntu  - main in my ubuntu hardy repo. Later, I discovered that I could neither cope up with bugs nor be useful in making tests since already 3.6.0 stable version is out. Now I want to revert to the...
2010-02-04T16:28:00.000Z	ksbalaji		...stable ver. 3.6.0 or 3.7.0. I tried uninstalling/reinstalling without efffect. I am installing only 3.6.2! HELP!
2010-02-04T16:29:00.000Z	Myrtti	ksbalaji	you need to uninstall first, then remove that line from your sources, and then find a place for a stable 3.6 or alternatively stick to the old firefox you were using.
2010-02-04T16:30:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Myrtti	I tried that. I also tried forcing version 3.6.0  - no use. I get back that 3.6.2 thing again and again on installing!
2010-02-04T16:31:00.000Z	Myrtti	ksbalaji	you removed the daily ppa from the sources, and cleared your package cache?
2010-02-04T16:32:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Myrtti	How to clear package cache?
2010-02-04T16:34:00.000Z	Myrtti	ksbalaji	sudo aptitude clean
2010-02-04T16:45:00.000Z	Myrtti	ksbalaji	it's not adviceable or easily possible yet
2010-02-04T16:46:00.000Z	Myrtti	ksbalaji	to any other version than the forthcoming 10.04, when it's released
2010-02-04T16:47:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Myrtti	so you suggest that from 8.04 to 10.04 is better than switching thru 9.xx?
2010-02-04T16:47:00.000Z	Myrtti	ksbalaji	it's certainly faster and less error prone
2010-02-04T16:47:00.000Z	Myrtti	ksbalaji	it's just not possible until 10.04 is officially released
2010-02-04T17:03:00.000Z	Myrtti	ksbalaji	the system probes what hardware it's on and probably won't complain at all. but you should try the live cd perhaps first
2010-02-04T17:27:00.000Z	Myrtti	ksbalaji	I've not even heard 3.7.0 has been officially published yet
2010-02-04T17:27:00.000Z	Myrtti	ksbalaji	and it's not, judging from mozilla.org
2010-02-04T17:28:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Myrtti	 my synapt. manages shows it.!
2010-02-04T17:28:00.000Z	Myrtti	ksbalaji	that doesn't mean it's officially released
2010-02-04T17:28:00.000Z	Myrtti	ksbalaji	if you've got only ubuntu repositories on your system, then you shouldn't even have anything above 3.5.2 visible
2010-02-04T17:29:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Myrtti	then which is the stable ver to go with Hardy? I want to make sure before installing! now I have removed ff fully and cleaned my cache.
2010-02-04T17:31:00.000Z	Myrtti	ksbalaji	^
2010-02-04T17:33:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Myrtti	thanks and ubottu is becoming clever. Wherefrom it got the cue?
2010-12-23T19:21:00.000Z	Myrtti	ksbalaji	any console you want
