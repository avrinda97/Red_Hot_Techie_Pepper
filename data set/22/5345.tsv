2007-09-04T15:07:00.000Z	gerro	revilodraw	what file system does it have?
2007-09-04T15:07:00.000Z	revilodraw	gerro	ntfs
2007-09-04T15:08:00.000Z	gerro	revilodraw	linux doesn't use ntfs unless you have special ntfs drivers and windows won't use ext3 unless you have special ext 3 drivers use fat32 if you wish to share between the operating systems. But be warned fat32 and ntfs have fragmentation issues and ntfs is horribly unsecure. Best to use ext3
2007-09-04T15:08:00.000Z	revilodraw	gerro	well i must have those drivers cos i have used the external hard drive on my linux machine many times
2007-09-04T15:10:00.000Z	revilodraw	gerro	and jordan u: but i would lose all my stuff
2007-09-04T15:10:00.000Z	gerro	revilodraw	are you sure that drive is not using ext3 right now?
2007-09-04T15:11:00.000Z	revilodraw	gerro	and jordan u: i am sure its ntfs... and i have ntfs 3g
2007-09-04T15:11:00.000Z	gerro	revilodraw	you said your linux install is using it fine then you probably need ext3 driver for windows google for it
2007-09-04T15:11:00.000Z	revilodraw	gerro	no my linux osnt using it fine... i cant  mount it to then unmount it in linux
2007-09-04T15:11:00.000Z	gerro	revilodraw	then ntfs 3g probably screwed up, its still in a partial beta really. the ext3 stuff if however fully documented unlike ntfs so you'd have better luck using ext3 driver on windows
2007-09-04T15:13:00.000Z	revilodraw	gerro	and jordan: ntfs doesnt give lots of stuff to play around with! its either on or off, so to speak
2007-09-04T15:15:00.000Z	gerro	revilodraw	force it to mount on windows or ubuntu?
2007-09-04T15:23:00.000Z	revilodraw	gerro	how can i force windows to mount it then?
2007-09-04T15:23:00.000Z	gerro	revilodraw	I had some trouble with windows before some idiot tried installing those little cds that come with digital cameras and they screwed up usb support completely try restarting windows and hope usb port works if not reinstall windows
2007-09-04T15:24:00.000Z	gerro	revilodraw	or hey even switch to xubuntu 7.04 very nice
2007-09-04T15:25:00.000Z	revilodraw	gerro	how would that help?
2007-09-04T15:26:00.000Z	gerro	revilodraw	does the external hard drive connect through usb? my guess is the windows usb handling system is screwed up
2007-09-04T15:26:00.000Z	gerro	revilodraw	that is just one scenario
2007-09-04T15:27:00.000Z	gerro	revilodraw	if worst comes to worst. Take out that hard drive and hook it up to the other computer
2007-09-04T15:28:00.000Z	gerro	revilodraw	but if you do that don't write anything only read it
