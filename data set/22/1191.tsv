2011-02-04T19:53:00.000Z	pksadiq		how to fix a USB flash drive messed up using cat /dev/null > /dev/sdc   :( my pendrive dead
2011-02-04T19:53:00.000Z	Bushman	pksadiq	tried gparted?
2011-02-04T19:53:00.000Z	pksadiq	Bushman	not working
2011-02-04T19:54:00.000Z	Bushman	pksadiq	fdisk?
2011-02-04T19:55:00.000Z	pksadiq	Bushman	e2fsck shows some error, and parted allows me to format but I could not mount
2011-02-04T19:56:00.000Z	pksadiq	Bushman	and too I think there is some problem with firmware, do you know how to burn firmware to device in linux if I get the bin file?
2011-02-04T19:56:00.000Z	Bushman	pksadiq	gparted does not work or it can't handle the pendrive?
2011-02-04T19:57:00.000Z	pksadiq	Bushman	I mean I need to rewrite the firmware
2011-02-04T19:57:00.000Z	Bushman	pksadiq	what's the device?
2011-02-04T19:57:00.000Z	pksadiq	Bushman	usb pendrive
2011-02-04T19:57:00.000Z	Bushman	pksadiq	MP4 by chance?
2011-02-04T19:58:00.000Z	pksadiq	Bushman	no, simply a pendrive, I just need a tool to burn firmware
2011-02-04T20:06:00.000Z	pksadiq	Bushman	paste the line in lsusb here , that says about your USB dongle
2011-02-04T20:09:00.000Z	pksadiq	Bushman	paste the one line in lsusb here , that says about your USB dongle
2011-02-04T20:10:00.000Z	Bushman	pksadiq	10 seconds
2011-02-04T20:11:00.000Z	Bushman	pksadiq	is that it?
2011-02-04T20:11:00.000Z	pksadiq	Bushman	k, that's it
2011-02-04T20:13:00.000Z	pksadiq	Bushman	search for "0a12:0001" and select the linux Bluetooth HOW TO and check if it does help you
2011-02-04T20:13:00.000Z	pksadiq	Bushman	hope better to google
2011-02-04T20:14:00.000Z	Bushman	pksadiq	will look into that. gime a minute or ten
2011-02-04T20:19:00.000Z	Bushman	pksadiq	i've looked into the HOWTO and they made the example based on exactly the same BT dongle as mine. i take that as "compatible with linux".
2011-02-04T20:20:00.000Z	pksadiq	Bushman	and so I think the problem is specific to your dongle, or your computer, everywhere it says it works, isn't it ?
