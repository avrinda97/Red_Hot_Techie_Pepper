2012-11-02T08:47:00.000Z	tomreyn	akis	which of these repositories you use is very much up to you and your preferences.
2012-11-02T08:52:00.000Z	akis	tomreyn	i understand and i know that. by default i can see that they are checked (at other software) Indipendent and Indipendent (source code)? why Canonical Partners, Canonical Partners (source code) aren't checked by default and what do they provide me if i will check them. will they provide me something important?
2012-11-02T08:54:00.000Z	tomreyn	akis	canonical, the company behind ubuntu, has some contracts with other companies which make proprietary software. the results of these contracts are available in this repository.
2012-11-02T08:55:00.000Z	tomreyn		it includes one variant of adobe flash player and reader, i think.
2012-11-02T08:57:00.000Z	akis	tomreyn	thank you for clarification. so do i have to check them, am i loosing something important if i leave them uncheck (default) or should i check them?
2012-11-02T08:59:00.000Z	tomreyn	akis	i couldn't tell what's important to you
2012-11-02T09:01:00.000Z	akis	tomreyn	ok. i c. i leave them uncheck as default.
2012-11-02T09:07:00.000Z	tomreyn	akis	(as an example) here's a list of packages in the partner repository for 12.10 x86_64: http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/dists/quantal/partner/binary-amd64/
2012-11-02T09:07:00.000Z	tomreyn		you can also browse the directory structure of the extras ("independent") repositories this way.
2012-11-02T09:11:00.000Z	akis	tomreyn	i realized that ubuntu center installed a 2nd Canonical Partners (other software) source and it was checked. Can i safely remove this duplicate source and leave the default which was created by the system's installation and leave it unchecked as default?
2012-11-02T09:13:00.000Z	tomreyn		if there are duplicates usinng the same repository location then you can remove one, yes
2012-11-02T09:17:00.000Z	akis	tomreyn	removing them using update manager's option is it a total remove or do i have to remove manually anything more?
2012-11-02T09:18:00.000Z	tomreyn	akis	that's sufficient
2012-11-02T09:18:00.000Z	akis	tomreyn	ok thanks a lot.
2012-11-02T09:18:00.000Z	tomreyn		as long as they still show in update manager they remain in /etc/apt/sources.list* but they will be commented out and thus inactive.
2012-11-02T09:21:00.000Z	akis		the dupicate i deleted already they dont be shown in update manager. are they still in /etc/apt/sources.list* as duplicates?
2012-11-02T09:22:00.000Z	tomreyn		if it fdoesn't show greyed out in update managed then it's all fone
2012-11-02T09:22:00.000Z	tomreyn		*gone
2012-11-02T09:24:00.000Z	akis	tomreyn	no they doesnt show at all. must they have gone. the same procedure must be followed for every othe remove of a software source. isn't it?
2012-11-02T09:26:00.000Z	tomreyn	akis	if you really want to delete any notion of an apt source, for whatever reason, yes. but normally just disabling them is fine, and allows you to reenable them later.
2012-11-02T09:26:00.000Z	tomreyn		!ops tdlguik1c
2012-11-02T09:28:00.000Z	akis	tomreyn	yes i know that and i am following already this method. it is very convenient.
