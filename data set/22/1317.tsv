2010-06-29T22:54:00.000Z	boybuonvn	ImaLamer	I don't know much English :(
2010-06-29T22:55:00.000Z	ImaLamer	boybuonvn	maybe the profile in the sound settings (gnome applet)
2010-06-29T22:55:00.000Z	boybuonvn	ImaLamer	i want to have 5.1 sound. how can I have it ?
2010-06-29T22:56:00.000Z	boybuonvn	ImaLamer	I don't see any profile named 5.1 sound, i only see Analog Stereo and Digital Stereo
2010-06-29T22:57:00.000Z	ImaLamer	boybuonvn	then do research into your hardware - maybe needs a diff setting or "driver", but linux sound isn't my thing :(
2010-06-29T22:57:00.000Z	boybuonvn	ImaLamer	I read a tutorial about this problem, but maybe it's only for Ubuntu 8.04
2010-06-29T22:59:00.000Z	boybuonvn	ImaLamer	I can't find Volume Control
2010-06-29T22:59:00.000Z	ImaLamer	boybuonvn	in gnome?
2010-06-29T23:00:00.000Z	boybuonvn	ImaLamer	yes :)
2010-06-29T23:01:00.000Z	ImaLamer	boybuonvn	then you have another issue :P maybe add to the panel?
2010-06-29T23:01:00.000Z	ImaLamer	boybuonvn	or bring up the pref under the menu
2010-06-29T23:01:00.000Z	boybuonvn	ImaLamer	the tutorial say that open Volume Control, select Playback Tab
2010-06-29T23:02:00.000Z	boybuonvn	ImaLamer	I only see Volume Pref. without Playback tab
2010-06-29T23:02:00.000Z	boybuonvn	ImaLamer	where???
2010-06-29T23:06:00.000Z	boybuonvn	ImaLamer	Thanks very much. Bye :)
