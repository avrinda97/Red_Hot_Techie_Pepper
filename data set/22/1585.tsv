2010-06-24T10:51:00.000Z	abhi_nav	red2kic	they will now overwritge each other. but you wll have all aps for gnome and kde desktop. i.e. no of aps will increase
2010-06-24T10:51:00.000Z	red2kic	abhi_nav	Meaning if a user bob installed opera browser, it'll show up in user dave?
2010-06-24T10:52:00.000Z	abhi_nav	red2kic	what we installed from admin account wll show up in every normal account in both kde and gnome
2010-06-24T10:54:00.000Z	red2kic	abhi_nav	I understand. I'm trying to figure out what's the best way to have all DE system for experiments without having them tied up together? I want the experiences of native KDE, native XFCE, native GNOME, etc...? Physical hard drives to swap around is one alternative. I don't want any virtuals.
2010-06-24T10:55:00.000Z	abhi_nav	red2kic	what is de?
2010-06-24T10:56:00.000Z	abhi_nav	red2kic	so you want to install gnome,kde, xfce but you dont want their aps to be grouped toghet? thats not possible.
2010-06-24T10:57:00.000Z	red2kic	abhi_nav	Meh. So every users will have to see any new packages that are installed from other users.
2010-06-24T10:57:00.000Z	abhi_nav	red2kic	not by other standarad users. but by other admin users
2010-06-24T10:57:00.000Z	abhi_nav	red2kic	e.g. if bob install some software and bob is NOT admin then nobody else can see that software.
2010-06-24T10:57:00.000Z	abhi_nav	red2kic	but if bot IS admin and he install any software then all wll see that software
2010-06-24T10:59:00.000Z	red2kic	abhi_nav	Alright, I guess I'll opt for virtuals (for now). Maybe bunch of hard drives.
2010-06-24T10:59:00.000Z	abhi_nav	red2kic	hmm
2010-06-24T11:01:00.000Z	abhi_nav	red2kic	best way to learn such things is not theory but is practical. do it yourself try with gnome and kde. try to remove software of gnome you dont want in kde etc. Alwasy experimetn and learn. thats the more knowledgeable
2010-06-24T11:01:00.000Z	red2kic	abhi_nav	Yes. I want to avoid metapackages, is all. :)
2010-06-24T11:01:00.000Z	abhi_nav	red2kic	hmm
2010-06-24T11:02:00.000Z	red2kic	abhi_nav	But if I have to remember what packages I installed after I purged users. Meh.
2010-06-24T11:02:00.000Z	abhi_nav	red2kic	ohh
2010-06-28T12:12:00.000Z	red2kic	abhi_nav	Miro?
2010-07-01T20:11:00.000Z	abhi_nav	red2kic	what?
2010-07-01T20:12:00.000Z	red2kic	abhi_nav	Nothing. Good job. ;3
2010-07-01T20:12:00.000Z	abhi_nav	red2kic	ahh ok :)
2010-07-01T20:12:00.000Z	abhi_nav	red2kic	I have dark powers.
