2007-03-09T17:49:00.000Z	joe4444		gonna try that...
2007-03-09T17:50:00.000Z	joe4444		no, but the guide i read said that option is for 3d accel
2007-03-09T17:50:00.000Z	joe4444		Option "EnablePrivateBackZ" "yes" #Enable 3d support <= May Not Work
2007-03-09T17:52:00.000Z	joe4444		newb question: can i quickly shut down Gnome (to get a console only), modify /etc/X11/xorg.conf and then restart Gnome?  all w/o rebooting
2007-03-09T17:53:00.000Z	jrib	joe4444	yes, edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, log out, then press ctrl-alt-backspace
2007-03-21T14:44:00.000Z	jrib	joe4444	applications > accessories > take screen shot    or press your PrintScreen button on your keyboard
2007-03-21T14:45:00.000Z	jrib	joe4444	oh you said "screen*cast*", ignore me then
2007-03-21T14:46:00.000Z	jrib	joe4444	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CreatingScreencasts
2007-04-01T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	joe4444	yes, in gconf-editor   /apps/metacity
2007-04-01T16:18:00.000Z	joe4444	jrib	thanks
2007-04-01T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	joe4444	if <super_l> doesn't work, you can use:
2007-04-01T16:20:00.000Z	joe4444	jrib	isn't there a shortcut to gconf-editor somewhere in the apps or system menu?
2007-04-01T16:20:00.000Z	jrib	joe4444	it got removed a couple of versions ago, you need to run 'gconf-editor' in a terminal
2007-04-01T16:21:00.000Z	joe4444	jrib	hmm i thought i saw it in the menu... maybe that was when i first tried xubuntu
2007-04-01T16:21:00.000Z	jrib	joe4444	it used to be in "system tools"
2007-04-01T16:29:00.000Z	joe4444	jrib	after setting a keyboard shortcut using gconf-editor will it be active immediately?  i can't seem to get any key combo to open a new terminal
2007-04-01T16:31:00.000Z	jrib	joe4444	should work immediately yes
2007-04-01T16:31:00.000Z	joe4444	jrib	i tried <Super>t  <Super_L>t  <mod4>t  <Control><Alt>t  -- nothing works =/
2007-04-01T16:32:00.000Z	jrib	joe4444	are you running beryl or compiz?
2007-04-01T16:32:00.000Z	joe4444	jrib	yep... do i need to restart the window manager?
2007-04-01T16:32:00.000Z	jrib	joe4444	well that means you aren't running metacity
2007-04-01T16:33:00.000Z	jrib	joe4444	I think you can setup shortcuts for commands in each of those, just use a custom command '/usr/bin/gnome-terminal'
