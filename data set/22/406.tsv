2011-10-22T21:21:00.000Z	sandra_		Morning my fellow Ubuntu inmates.
2011-10-22T21:22:00.000Z	sandra_		Hello milan
2011-10-22T21:22:00.000Z	firelord42	sandra_	afternoon
2011-10-22T21:22:00.000Z	sandra_	firelord42	Afternoon
2011-10-22T21:24:00.000Z	firelord42	sandra_	cursor hell?
2011-10-22T21:26:00.000Z	sandra_	firelord42	yes my cursor just blinks after "checking on Battery" line
2011-10-22T21:27:00.000Z	firelord42	sandra_	ironically it went the other way for me, 11.10 is far happier on my computer, did you try starting it after editing the bootloader command to omit quiet?
2011-10-22T21:30:00.000Z	firelord42	sandra_	it will force it to give more verbose information, when booting, hold the shift key and remove the word quiet from the linux line ,and then boot
2011-10-22T21:32:00.000Z	sandra_	firelord42	 thank you , not that I would know what to look for *chuckle*
2011-10-22T21:33:00.000Z	firelord42	sandra_	no problem, just look to see what its stopping at or what it seems to be yelling about, thats what i do :P
2011-10-22T21:34:00.000Z	firelord42	sandra_	shouldnt make too much of a difference afaik, just install the 32bit libraries for the ones that misbehave if you do that, but it really doesnt matter unless you have >=4GB of ram
2011-10-22T21:35:00.000Z	firelord42	sandra_	simple, ram, if you need it, you need 64bit :P
2011-10-22T21:36:00.000Z	sandra_	firelord42	my 32 bit version of 11.04 can see all 8 gigs of my memory :-)
2011-10-22T21:36:00.000Z	firelord42	sandra_	are you sure its running 32bit? 0.o
2011-10-22T21:37:00.000Z	firelord42	sandra_	ah, but it still is not the best way to do it really AFIK
2011-10-22T21:38:00.000Z	firelord42	sandra_	because what its doing is sort of a trick afaik, it works, but it imposes other limitations too
2011-10-22T21:43:00.000Z	sandra_	firelord42	I'm a project manager by trade & tend to think in terms of does it work and is there any real world difference . For example I have no performance performances improvments say with Gimp using 64 bit version of Ubuntu they both work the same on 32 and 64 bit editions.
2011-10-22T21:44:00.000Z	firelord42	sandra_	have you tried the 64bit version extensively?
2011-10-22T21:44:00.000Z	firelord42	sandra_	i understand the line of thinking, but from what i know, there *should* be performance improvements
2011-10-22T21:46:00.000Z	firelord42	sandra_	i mean whats happening is PAE is actually toggelign what is considered your memory from what I understand, and when you need the other memory, you need to shift everything around
2011-10-22T21:47:00.000Z	firelord42	sandra_	could be that the rendering test you used did not do something memory intensive?
2011-10-22T21:50:00.000Z	firelord42	sandra_	idk, i know theorietically it should be a major real difference afaik, but if it doesnt make a difference to you, its really whatever you perfer :P
