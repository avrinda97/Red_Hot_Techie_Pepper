2011-09-23T05:26:00.000Z	surfnsound		ANyone have a suggestion on why websites won't load after a fresh install (10.04)? I've disable ipv6 and changed the DNS togoogle public dns. There are no proxy setting in the network setup or browser preferences.
2011-09-23T05:27:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	can you ping anything?
2011-09-23T05:28:00.000Z	surfnsound	Shirakawasuna	yes, pinging in terminal is no problem
2011-09-23T05:30:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	interesting
2011-09-23T05:30:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	so you can ping www.google.com and it resolves and everything?
2011-09-23T05:30:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	because I don't know why something like chrome wouldn't work then
2011-09-23T05:31:00.000Z	surfnsound	Shirakawasuna	yes, pinging google.com resolves with 2% loss
2011-09-23T05:36:00.000Z	surfnsound	Shirakawasuna	my wired connection actually seems to be ok
2011-09-23T05:37:00.000Z	surfnsound	Shirakawasuna	yes, that is clean
2011-09-23T05:38:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	cool
2011-09-23T05:38:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	so it's not ipv6.
2011-09-23T05:38:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	if ethernet is working, it's (obviously) something related to your wi-fi, either your card, wi-fi-related software, multiple network setup stuff, or your router
2011-09-23T05:39:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	maybe it's having trouble setting up your wireless interface properly
2011-09-23T05:41:00.000Z	surfnsound	Shirakawasuna	should I try setting the ipv4 setting manually?
2011-09-23T05:43:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	It's possible, but I don't know why it'd work.
2011-09-23T05:43:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	just trying different configurations isn't a bad idea
2011-09-23T05:45:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	Are you dualbooting? If this problem persisted in e.g. Windows XP you'd know it was hardware
2011-09-23T05:47:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	darn, I was kind of hoping it was hardware
2011-09-23T05:49:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	I'm out of ideas, but I'm a little new to ubuntu so don't give up yet. Basically I would start looking into your specific wireless card/drivers (lspci for the card, lsmod for modules). I would also try disabling all network interfaces besides wireless and trying things out. Also compare windows/linux side by side, right next to the router....
2011-09-23T05:49:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	after that I don't know... besides maybe trying 10.10 or 11.04
2011-09-23T05:49:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	incidentally, why are you using 10.04?
2011-09-23T05:52:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	surfnsound	you could try out natty's liveCD environment and see if the wireless works better
