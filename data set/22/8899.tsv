2007-10-09T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	iamollie	and system-admin-synaptic is your ticket to installing software
2007-10-09T11:12:00.000Z	nickrud	iamollie	hm, sounds like you have some sources problems. Have you made any changes to /etc/apt/sources.list that you know of?
2007-10-09T11:13:00.000Z	nickrud	iamollie	go to system->admin->software sources, and make sure that the universe & multiverse options are ticked
2007-10-09T11:14:00.000Z	nickrud	iamollie	sure would, that's where java is fetched from.
2007-10-09T11:15:00.000Z	nickrud	iamollie	you have a proxy?
2007-10-09T11:16:00.000Z	nickrud	iamollie	well, I guess you just said you did, a sec
2007-10-09T11:19:00.000Z	nickrud	iamollie	a sec, putting together a pastebin for you

2007-10-09T11:23:00.000Z	nickrud	iamollie	there are instructions in it
2007-10-09T11:26:00.000Z	nickrud	iamollie	I'll stick it on another pastebin, google was blank for me for a few hours yesterday

2007-10-09T11:28:00.000Z	nickrud	iamollie	I'm at work, gotta step away for a few. I will return, not too long
2007-10-09T11:39:00.000Z	nickrud	iamollie	how'd it go?
2007-10-09T11:41:00.000Z	nickrud	iamollie	gksudo gedit , use your password, you should get a editing window. if that fails, (I have to go again) use sudo nano
