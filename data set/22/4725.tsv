2008-09-28T10:06:00.000Z	ziesemer		Not even comparable, actually.  :-)
2008-09-28T10:07:00.000Z	ziesemer		Does anyone know what downloading the extra GB in the DVD releases offers over the CD releases in Hardy Heron, etc.?
2008-09-28T10:07:00.000Z	ziesemer		(The colors are easily changable - back to blue, etc.  :-)
2008-09-28T10:08:00.000Z	ziesemer		See, I was wondering about "server".
2008-09-28T10:08:00.000Z	ziesemer		Including server?
2008-09-28T10:09:00.000Z	ziesemer		As I AM on a slow net connection (EVDO).  I have the x64 DVD.  Just installed regular desktop ubuntu.  Thinking I should've done server instead...
2008-09-28T10:10:00.000Z	ziesemer		&& will run the 2nd part only if the 1st part completes successfully.
2008-09-28T10:11:00.000Z	ziesemer		Network-Manager is interfering.  Deciding between just disabling it and whatever else I'm going to run into, or just use server.
2008-09-28T10:12:00.000Z	ziesemer		One of the exact problems I was having, which is why I was inquiring about server.
2008-09-28T10:12:00.000Z	ziesemer		ifup / ifdown doesn't work by default under recent Ubuntu, because Network Manager is taking them over.
2008-09-28T10:12:00.000Z	sjovan	ziesemer	juk! that sucks teh balls
2008-09-28T10:13:00.000Z	ziesemer	sjovan	what does?
2008-09-28T10:13:00.000Z	sjovan	ziesemer	that ifup / down doesn't work any more
2008-09-28T10:14:00.000Z	sjovan	ziesemer	but maby you can help frankie_ out. his /etc/network/interfaces looks good but he don't get any net with cabel
2008-09-28T10:15:00.000Z	ziesemer	sjovan	/ franike, assuming the same network works elsewhere?  That it's not a problem with the cable modem, etc.?
2008-09-28T10:16:00.000Z	sjovan	ziesemer	he's on a mac now, so i'm asumeing that the modem is all good :)
2008-09-28T10:31:00.000Z	sjovan	ziesemer	isn't that a problem sign if nothing get listed on ---> dmesg | grep Ethernet <--- ?
2008-09-28T10:32:00.000Z	ziesemer	sjovan	I don't know.  I'd personally just be interested in ifconfig.  If it shows a MAC, etc., it's communicating with the hardware.
2008-09-28T10:33:00.000Z	ziesemer	sjovan	is it that frankie_ just isn't getting a DHCP IP addr?
2008-09-28T10:34:00.000Z	sjovan	ziesemer	jeez... why didn't i think about that (oh yeah, that's right... it 7:33 AM and I'm drunk) :) good tip
2008-09-28T10:46:00.000Z	sjovan	ziesemer	frankie_ : yeah, this doesn't look like a hw problem at all.... check the cabel, restart the router. maby a static ip could help?
2008-09-28T10:48:00.000Z	sjovan	ziesemer	nah, but time for bed. say good night to frankie_ from me (if he got logged off now). this is his interfaces btw ---> http://pastebin.com/d1dcbc690
