2011-07-21T10:39:00.000Z	textwister		Just reinstalled a laptop from Ubu 9.04 to 11.04. Wireless was working, now doesn't. lspci shows BCM5755M wireless. The Add'l drivers app offered the Broadcom STA wireless and I installed it, but my chipset is not listed and it didn't work. lspci shows the device, Network Manager doesn't. I enabled the wireless in system setup and disabled the HW switch to remove that from consideration. rfkill shows the device and shows it unblock
2011-07-21T10:39:00.000Z	textwister		ed.  Any suggestions are appreciated.
2011-07-21T10:41:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	textwister	Have you looked through the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf to see if the driver is blacklisted?
2011-07-21T10:42:00.000Z	textwister	YankDownUnder	will try
2011-07-21T10:44:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	textwister	Something you can try - in order to further troubleshoot this, is to UNblacklist the BCM driver in the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf, then restart the machine, then let it try to find the driver again...(been there before)
2011-07-21T10:49:00.000Z	textwister	YankDownUnder	In blacklist.conf I have bcm43xx.  But in blacklist-bcm43.conf I also have bcm43xx, as well as b43 and b43legacy. Which of these do I comment out?  And do I uninstall the STA driver first?
2011-07-21T10:50:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	textwister	Unblacklist them from each, then restart, try "jockey-gtk" to see if it will recognise the proper driver at that point my friend.
2011-07-21T11:02:00.000Z	textwister	YankDownUnder	Still no joy...  NetManager has an "Enable Networking" entry but no "Enable Wireless Networking", No wireless device shows up in its configuration panels. But lspci shows the device, as does rfkill.  Not sure what to look for in lsmod output
2011-07-21T11:03:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	textwister	Right oh. You're trying to load the atheros driver, right?
2011-07-21T11:04:00.000Z	textwister	YankDownUnder	jockey-gtk calls it the Broadcom STA wireless driver.  Is that atheros?
2011-07-21T11:04:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	textwister	Is it already activated, or is it asking you if you want to activate it?
2011-07-21T11:06:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	textwister	then de-activate it, open a term, and we'll try something right now, eh?
2011-07-21T11:06:00.000Z	textwister	YankDownUnder	"Remove" same as deactivate?  No deactivate option here.
2011-07-21T11:07:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	textwister	Just close jocky, open a term...we'll try something, eh?
2011-07-21T11:07:00.000Z	textwister	YankDownUnder	sure.  I'm ready
2011-07-21T11:08:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	textwister	In the open terminal, type: sudo lsmod => paste the output to pastebin
2011-07-21T11:16:00.000Z	textwister	YankDownUnder	http://pastebin.com/GnG0aWn3
2011-07-21T11:16:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	textwister	Looking now...
2011-07-21T11:19:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	textwister	It's not loading anything mate...SO, open a term, and type: sudo modprobe bc43xx => then type: sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager restart => then check in your Network Manager if the wireless is working, eh?
2011-07-21T11:21:00.000Z	textwister	YankDownUnder	That may have been w/ the STA driver removed...
2011-07-21T11:34:00.000Z	textwister	YankDownUnder	Switching from the STA driver to the 'firmware-b43-installer' and the 'b43-fwcutter' apparently fixed my problem.  Followed this page: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1745437.  Thanks for your assistance.
2011-07-21T11:35:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	textwister	Roger that, have fun
