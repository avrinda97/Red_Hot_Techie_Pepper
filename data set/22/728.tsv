2012-07-12T03:27:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	AHCI should be well supported
2012-07-12T03:27:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	you should be more specific about exactly what makes you say that
2012-07-12T03:30:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	sudo mount /dev/sdX# /media/mountpoint
2012-07-12T03:33:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	you have to fill in the X# with the correct values
2012-07-12T03:46:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	usually you dont need to unless there is something weird
2012-07-12T03:46:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	what kind of fs is it
2012-07-12T03:47:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	open the disk utility it should be able to tell you
2012-07-12T03:48:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	gparted is fine, but there is also a disk utility
2012-07-12T03:49:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	hit the windows key and type "disk utility" (unless you arent running unity/gnome)
2012-07-12T03:50:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	i dont know what tools kde provides for this. but it probably has something
2012-07-12T03:52:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	you can also do "sudo parted -l"
2012-07-12T03:55:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	so you dont have anything on the drive. its blank
2012-07-12T03:55:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	no. there is nothing to mount. you have to mkfs a filesystem first
2012-07-12T03:56:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	you can use a gui, or just run mkfs.type /dev/sdb1
2012-07-12T04:00:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	it probably doesn't help the installers when you do weird things prior to starting
2012-07-12T04:07:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	then dont reinstall
2012-07-12T04:07:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	and if you must reinstall look at things like etc-keeper and !clone
2012-07-12T04:10:00.000Z	escott	lanc3r	no you would have to resize before/after to make it the correct size
