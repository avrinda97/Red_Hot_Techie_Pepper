2008-04-28T09:25:00.000Z	Wolf23		helpers, anyone help plz, my two hdd on gutsy was named: windows and hdb5,now on hardy there names show as: 30.5 GB Media ,can anyone help me , thanx
2008-04-28T09:26:00.000Z	JohnPhys	Wolf23	as long as you didn't format / repartition those partitions, /dev/hdb5 should still be there I think
2008-04-28T09:28:00.000Z	Wolf23	JohnPhys	 thanx, but how
2008-04-28T09:29:00.000Z	JohnPhys	Wolf23	are you just looking for your old partitions?  whoever suggested "sudo fdisk -l" is correct, that should list everything for you
2008-04-28T09:31:00.000Z	Wolf23	JohnPhys	 like if i rename from ntfs tools, it says that hdb5 is in use choose another name
2008-04-28T09:31:00.000Z	JohnPhys	Wolf23	then hdb5 must already be mounted
2008-04-28T09:32:00.000Z	JohnPhys	Wolf23	 type "mount | grep hdb5" at a terminal
2008-04-28T09:32:00.000Z	JohnPhys	Wolf23	That should tell you where your partition is mounted
2008-04-28T09:32:00.000Z	Wolf23	JohnPhys	 but i cant see the hdd name: hdb5,but they show as 30.5 GB Media <--
2008-04-28T09:33:00.000Z	JohnPhys	Wolf23	ah....so you want hardy to display the "name" of the device rather than "30.0 GB Partition"?
2008-04-28T09:33:00.000Z	Wolf23	JohnPhys	 /dev/sda5 on /media/hdb5 type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,noatime,allow_other,blksize=4096)
2008-04-28T09:33:00.000Z	Wolf23	JohnPhys	 yes
2008-04-28T09:35:00.000Z	JohnPhys	Wolf23	Ah, sorry, I misunderstood you.  I haven't tried this in Hardy, but it worked in Gutsy.  I just named the folder in /media what I wanted the drive to be called.  In other words, if I wanted teh drive to be called "Win XP", I made a folder /media/Win XP, then mounted /dev/sdawhatever to /media/Win XP
2008-04-28T09:37:00.000Z	Wolf23	JohnPhys	 so where is the solution?
2008-04-28T09:38:00.000Z	JohnPhys	Wolf23	 Did you see the last message I sent?  About naming folders in /media?
2008-04-28T09:38:00.000Z	Wolf23	JohnPhys	 they already have renames
2008-04-28T09:39:00.000Z	JohnPhys	Wolf23	I'm sorry, I don't understand.  "They already have renames"?
2008-04-28T09:39:00.000Z	Wolf23	JohnPhys	 and on /media they seems empty
2008-04-28T09:39:00.000Z	JohnPhys	Wolf23	Let me try to get it to work on my hardy install real quick.  Just to check, You want the drives, as they show up in "Places" and on the desktop, to have some name, like "Music Drive" or "Windows", right?
2008-04-28T09:41:00.000Z	Wolf23	JohnPhys	 ok
2008-04-28T09:51:00.000Z	JohnPhys	Wolf23	Sorry, I can't seem to get the same behavior under Hardy as I have in Gusy
2008-04-28T10:07:00.000Z	Wolf23	JohnPhys	 so there is no solution?
