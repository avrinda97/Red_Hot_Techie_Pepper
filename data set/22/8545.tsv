2005-07-21T14:24:00.000Z	nickrud	Belutz	you must have a valid root password to use webadmin, sudo is not sufficient
2005-07-22T12:22:00.000Z	nickrud	Belutz	what they mean is check backports, get libdvdcss, then uncheck it. That qualifies as 'not regularly' :)
2005-07-22T12:50:00.000Z	Belutz	nickrud	i already install vlc and libdvdcss2, i can play DVD movies, but i got no sound, what might cause the problem?
2005-07-22T12:50:00.000Z	nickrud	Belutz	I don't have a dvd, so I don't have a clue :)
2005-07-22T13:36:00.000Z	nickrud	Belutz	no, just get the libdvdcss or whatever, then uncheck backports again
2005-07-22T13:36:00.000Z	Belutz	nickrud	ok thx
2005-07-22T13:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Belutz	it would be best to just do sudo apt-get install libdvdcss from the command line
2005-07-22T13:38:00.000Z	Belutz	nickrud	yup.. i already installed it and dvd movies are working, and the sound is working too now :)
2005-07-22T13:39:00.000Z	nickrud	Belutz	no, no sharing of mboxes, but you can use dovecot-imapd to maintain a mail store both can use
2005-07-22T13:40:00.000Z	Belutz	nickrud	actually i'm POP-ing from gmail, is it possible to use that dovecot-imapd ?
2005-07-22T13:41:00.000Z	nickrud	Belutz	I would think so, I pop from my net email account and drop it where dovecot can see it
2005-07-22T13:42:00.000Z	Belutz	nickrud	ok, let me try it
2005-07-22T13:44:00.000Z	Belutz	nickrud	on second thought, maybe i just use thunderbird and uninstall evolution
2005-07-22T13:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Belutz	:)
2005-07-22T13:45:00.000Z	Belutz	nickrud	btw, what's the different between 'removal' and 'complete removal' ? is 'removal' doesn't clean all the files?
2005-08-06T09:54:00.000Z	Belutz	nickrud	hmmm synaptic don't do that i guess
2005-08-06T09:54:00.000Z	Belutz	nickrud	but aptitude do that? i should've known earlier :D
2005-08-06T09:54:00.000Z	nickrud	Belutz	I think it's supposed to. I'm not sure if aptitude and synaptic use the same package tracking mechanism, tho
2005-08-06T09:55:00.000Z	Belutz	nickrud	i was installing kubuntu-desktop, when i uninstall it didn't uninstall all the packages installed with kubuntu-desktop, so i have to uninstalled the rest manually
2005-08-06T09:55:00.000Z	nickrud	Belutz	yes, that's why I use aptitude :)
2005-08-06T09:56:00.000Z	Belutz	nickrud	*nods*
