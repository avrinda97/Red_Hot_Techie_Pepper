2009-06-14T02:22:00.000Z	Darael	ikonia	what question?
2009-06-14T02:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Darael	sorry - miss-type
2009-06-14T02:23:00.000Z	Darael	ikonia	ah - I se - no worie.
2010-01-19T19:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Darael	memory (ram) problem or an overclocked PC can do it
2010-01-19T19:35:00.000Z	Darael	ikonia	It was fine until yesterday, and the CPU not overclocked.
2010-01-19T19:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Darael	ram can go bad
2010-01-19T19:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Darael	launch firefox from the command line see if you get any hints
2010-01-19T19:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Darael	is this firefox supplied/packaged by ubuntu from the repos
2010-01-19T19:36:00.000Z	Darael	ikonia	It's the repo supplied one, and I have been running it from the terminal - that's how I know it's segfaulting.
2010-01-19T19:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Darael	no clues in there ?
2010-01-19T19:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Darael	has anything changed/been updated on your box ?
2010-01-19T19:37:00.000Z	Darael	ikonia	No updates since the day before yesterday.
2010-12-20T16:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Darael	thank you
2010-12-20T16:57:00.000Z	Darael	ikonia	Happy to help.
2011-03-22T01:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Darael	the ubuntu-studio theme
2011-03-22T01:51:00.000Z	Darael	ikonia	Yeah, I tried it... maybe I'm just too picky.  I'm not a fan of blue, and it's still a touch light for my tastes.
2011-03-22T01:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Darael	use it as a base and hack it, that's what I do, I too don't like the blue
2011-03-22T01:52:00.000Z	Darael	ikonia	Best suggestion I've had so far.
2011-04-25T20:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Darael	certainly possible,
2011-04-25T20:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Darael	don't forget uptime is an average,
2012-07-03T16:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Darael	talk to the hardware vendor to get the bios issue resolved or for them to explain what the option in the bios is
