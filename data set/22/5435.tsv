2007-06-28T13:27:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic		hi people.. i just installed apache2 on my computer to test php files and stuff.. but when i type apache2 in the terminal it gives me the following error: apache2: Syntax error on line 189 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: Could not open configuration file /etc/apache2/httpd.conf: No such file or directory
2007-06-28T13:27:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic		can anyone help me??
2007-06-28T13:28:00.000Z	Gnea	fuzzy_logic	you need to type the entire path out: /etc/init.d/apache2
2007-06-28T13:28:00.000Z	Gnea	fuzzy_logic	er, sudo /etc/init.d/apache2
2007-06-28T13:30:00.000Z	Gnea	fuzzy_logic	are you sure it's not running already?
2007-06-28T13:30:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	Gnea	as i said.. i can't get any output of the status..
2007-06-28T13:30:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	Gnea	it just jumps to the next terminal line
2007-06-28T13:31:00.000Z	Gnea	fuzzy_logic	and as I said, are you sure that it's not running already?  use this command:  ps axf | grep apache  or ps axf | grep httpd
2007-06-28T13:31:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	Gnea	11691 pts/1    S+     0:00      \_ grep apache
2007-06-28T13:33:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	Gnea	now i see that there isn't any httpd.conf, but there is a apache2.conf.. i assume that that is the problem.. but i have no idea how to make it look for apache2.conf and not httpd.conf, any ideas?
2007-06-28T13:34:00.000Z	Gnea	fuzzy_logic	no, make sure that the correct .conf file exists that it's looking for
2007-06-28T13:35:00.000Z	Gnea	fuzzy_logic	and assume nothing.
2007-06-28T13:35:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	Gnea	lol
2007-06-28T13:35:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	Gnea	so what you are suggesting is that i rename the file to httpd.conf?? i just did that.. and nothing happened
2007-06-28T13:36:00.000Z	Gnea	fuzzy_logic	what exactly are you typing that makes it stay 'the same'?
2007-06-28T13:37:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	Gnea	sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start (or restart, stop, status), and then it doesn't give me any output, just jumps to the next line
2007-06-28T13:37:00.000Z	Gnea	fuzzy_logic	there's no need to rename anything, you should just make a symbolic link
2007-06-28T13:37:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	Gnea	how do i do that?
2007-06-28T13:39:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	Gnea	thanks, but i know what a terminal is and how i can use it.. but how do i make a symbolic link??
2007-06-28T13:39:00.000Z	Gnea	fuzzy_logic	that site will tell you how.
2007-06-28T13:39:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	Gnea	ok thanks i will try it
2007-06-28T13:40:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	Gnea	i don't see anything about it..
