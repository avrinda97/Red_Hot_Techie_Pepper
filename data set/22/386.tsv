2011-11-02T03:41:00.000Z	theMAVERICK		is there a way to freeze your version of ubuntu so no upgrade or kernel updates take place?
2011-11-02T03:41:00.000Z	theMAVERICK		because whenever I run Maverick Meerkat Ubuntu 10.10
2011-11-02T03:41:00.000Z	theMAVERICK		everything is working PERFECTLY off the fresh install, but I have had 2 computer crashes
2011-11-02T03:42:00.000Z	theMAVERICK		I will check that out thanks
2011-11-02T03:42:00.000Z	theMAVERICK		Natty and Oneiric have made me a sad panda
2011-11-02T03:42:00.000Z	iceroot	theMAVERICK	remember, normally updates are for security-issues
2011-11-02T03:42:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	iceroot	what do you mean?
2011-11-02T03:43:00.000Z	iceroot	theMAVERICK	if you dont update your system (update != upgrade) you dont get security fixes
2011-11-02T03:44:00.000Z	iceroot	theMAVERICK	you dont have to go to 11.04 or 11.10 but you should install updates for 10.10 (which is the default option)
2011-11-02T03:44:00.000Z	iceroot	theMAVERICK	these updates dont change functions, just fixing security issues
2011-11-02T03:46:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	iceroot	okay, so as long as sources.list points to maverick and I don't upgrade, I shouldn't get new kernel versions?
2011-11-02T03:46:00.000Z	iceroot	theMAVERICK	correct only patchlevel-kernel-updates
2011-11-02T03:47:00.000Z	iceroot	theMAVERICK	e.g. 2.6.35-13 instead of 2.6.35-12 but never 2.6.38-x
2011-11-02T03:49:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	iceroot	ah, okay so that is what those mean...I can do that via synaptic or aptitude?
2011-11-02T03:49:00.000Z	iceroot	theMAVERICK	both
2011-11-02T03:50:00.000Z	iceroot	theMAVERICK	doesnt matter if you use synaptic, software-center,apt-get or aptitude, all of them are only installing sec-updates (but asking if you want 11.04)
2011-11-02T03:51:00.000Z	iceroot	theMAVERICK	so a normal "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" will NOT change your ubuntu-version and is recommend for the security updates
2011-11-02T03:52:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	iceroot	I am currently setting synaptic to prefer version maverick-security, that shoudl do the trick, right?
2011-11-02T03:52:00.000Z	iceroot	theMAVERICK	yes
2011-11-02T03:52:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	iceroot	thanks a bunch
2011-11-02T03:52:00.000Z	iceroot	theMAVERICK	also there is something like "dont look for release-upgrades"
2011-11-02T03:56:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	iceroot	the only options I saw under "prefer cersions from: were: maverick, maverick-security, and maverick updates
