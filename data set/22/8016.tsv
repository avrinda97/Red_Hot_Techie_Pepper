2005-11-01T17:40:00.000Z	Mabus06		working just fine
2005-11-01T17:40:00.000Z	Mabus06		messed with the xserver settings trying to make it work for geforce
2005-11-01T17:40:00.000Z	Mabus06		and thats probably what is making it so bad now
2005-11-01T17:40:00.000Z	Mabus06		Oh no, it was freshly installed yesterday on a newly formatted drive, I don't really have much to save
2005-11-01T17:41:00.000Z	Mabus06		but I assure you, clean install with nvidia enabled WILL freeze at hotplug
2005-11-01T17:41:00.000Z	Mabus06		before the second phase or whatever of the install process
2005-11-01T17:42:00.000Z	Mabus06		yes
2005-11-01T17:42:00.000Z	Mabus06		I just finished burning off fedora... should I try to use that distro instead of this one?
2005-11-01T17:42:00.000Z	Mabus06		I know, I know, you'll all tell me fedora is worse.
2005-11-01T17:43:00.000Z	Mabus06		But I will use windows 95 if its the only thing that my geforce will run on... the svideo component is the main use of my computer
2005-11-01T17:43:00.000Z	kevix	Mabus06	have you tried 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2005-11-01T17:45:00.000Z	kevix	Mabus06	both locked your machine?
2005-11-01T17:45:00.000Z	kevix	Mabus06	did you try the 'vesa' (plain) driver?
2005-11-01T17:46:00.000Z	Mabus06	kevix	yes, I can run ubuntu just fine using the regular driver
2005-11-01T17:46:00.000Z	kevix	Mabus06	so do you NEED the other drivers or can you live with the vesa ones?
2005-11-01T17:51:00.000Z	kevix	Mabus06	'module-assistant' may help you.
2005-11-01T17:56:00.000Z	kevix	Mabus06	check this out: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-7448.html
2005-11-01T06:12:00.000Z	kevix	Mabus06	the config of /etc/X11/xorg.conf is not that hard to 'back up'.
2005-11-01T06:14:00.000Z	kevix	Mabus06	ctrl-alt-f7 goes to X, ctrl-alt-f1 to console.
2005-11-01T06:14:00.000Z	kevix	Mabus06	they work only if X is running.
2005-11-01T06:18:00.000Z	kevix	Mabus06	to make a backup just 'cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup'
2005-11-01T06:18:00.000Z	kevix	Mabus06	to restore 'cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf_backup /etc/x11/xorg.conf'
