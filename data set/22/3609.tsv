2008-07-22T23:23:00.000Z	migzu_		My friend just installed ubuntu. and when he applied restricted drivers (nvidia-glx) he got this http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/2695/05012006099na0.jpg
2008-07-22T23:23:00.000Z	migzu_		Any ideas?
2008-07-22T23:24:00.000Z	migzu_		It worked fine before nvidia-glx
2008-07-22T23:24:00.000Z	mgreen	migzu_	it worked with 'nv' drivers?
2008-07-22T23:24:00.000Z	migzu_	mgreen	Dunno what drivers he has
2008-07-22T23:25:00.000Z	mgreen	migzu_	yes, but it worked before using proprietary drivers, right?
2008-07-22T23:26:00.000Z	mgreen	migzu_	you could restore settings to use 'nv' driver
2008-07-22T23:26:00.000Z	mgreen	migzu_	type 'lspci'
2008-07-22T23:27:00.000Z	migzu_	mgreen	Ideas?
2008-07-22T23:27:00.000Z	mgreen	migzu_	look up in the history
2008-07-22T23:28:00.000Z	mgreen	migzu_	i've got 8600 gts
2008-07-22T23:28:00.000Z	mgreen	migzu_	you can start in failsafe mode, so that X won't start
2008-07-22T23:29:00.000Z	migzu_	mgreen	And how do i do taht
2008-07-22T23:29:00.000Z	mgreen	migzu_	you will see a message at boot.
2008-07-22T23:31:00.000Z	migzu_	mgreen	Could this problem be because of amd64?
2008-07-22T23:31:00.000Z	mgreen	migzu_	i'm running amd64
2008-07-22T23:31:00.000Z	mgreen	migzu_	start with what i told you. reboot the machine and go into failsafe. that way you will be able to edit your xorg.conf and start normally
2008-07-22T23:32:00.000Z	mgreen	migzu_	hmm, it's there... maybe your screen doesn't change resolution fast enough to show it
2008-07-22T23:33:00.000Z	mgreen	migzu_	i think you press escape
2008-07-22T23:33:00.000Z	migzu_	mgreen	that could be
2008-07-22T23:33:00.000Z	mgreen	migzu_	try rebooting and hammering escape :)
