2011-11-21T17:23:00.000Z	Rictoo		any idea why imagemagick mucks up appending lots of highres images with only 2gb ram? :(
2011-11-21T17:23:00.000Z	Rictoo		with the especially large images it outputs a pretty glitched image
2011-11-21T17:23:00.000Z	Rictoo		im just looking for a hardware explanation, if there is one :P
2011-11-21T17:24:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Rictoo	thats weird, i thought it'd either work or fail

2011-11-21T17:25:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Rictoo	look on their site. they done a lot of code improvements so it might work better
2011-11-21T17:27:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Rictoo	i think the commands are the same but im not 100% sure
2011-11-21T17:27:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Rictoo	i have both on my system but hardly touch them

2011-11-21T17:38:00.000Z	Rictoo	Gentoo64	thanks for the tip though. i'll report back in half an hour or so whether graphicsmagick can avoid glitchy images where imagemagick cant
