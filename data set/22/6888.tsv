2012-06-09T21:14:00.000Z	mobilnoob11		How am I involved in this?
2012-06-09T21:15:00.000Z	mobilnoob11		?
2012-06-09T21:15:00.000Z	mobilnoob11		What did I do?
2012-06-09T21:16:00.000Z	mobilnoob11		Who decided that I'm a troll?
2012-06-09T21:18:00.000Z	mobilnoob11		HELLO!
2012-06-09T21:20:00.000Z	mobilnoob11		Ok, well, I was hoping to get some insight into this, but I guess you are all busy.
2012-06-09T21:20:00.000Z	mobilnoob11		Or you don't know...
2012-06-09T21:22:00.000Z	mobilnoob11		shut up
2012-06-09T21:22:00.000Z	mobilnoob11		idiot
2012-06-09T21:22:00.000Z	mobilnoob11		I have an actual question
2012-06-09T21:22:00.000Z	deitarion	mobilnoob11	I was considering looking back at what you wanted, but if you're going to be rude to someone I was helping, forget it.
2012-06-09T21:24:00.000Z	deitarion	mobilnoob11	He asked a quick question to save himself a little effort. It wasn't ideal, but rudeness automatically makes you wrong.
2012-06-09T21:24:00.000Z	deitarion	mobilnoob11	I can only help so many people. Ignoring some to help others is expected.
2012-06-09T21:28:00.000Z	deitarion	mobilnoob11	wait
2012-06-09T21:29:00.000Z	deitarion	mobilnoob11	Just finished reading what you said. I still think you're being rude, but since you genuinely seem to have slipped through the cracks (it's a trivial question to answer), I'll answer it for you.
2012-06-09T21:30:00.000Z	deitarion	mobilnoob11	"modprobe -r athl1c" unloads your wireless driver. (For future reference, you can read about it with the `man modprobe` command)
2012-06-09T21:31:00.000Z	deitarion	mobilnoob11	If that fixes your problem, the best guess I have is that the currently-included version of the driver has a bug in it that causes your system to freeze.
2012-06-09T21:32:00.000Z	deitarion	mobilnoob11	I'm not familiar with your particular hardware (the only WiFi-enabled device I own is a pocket computer I connect using a USB wired ethernet adapter) so give me a sec to read more of that thread.
2012-06-09T21:36:00.000Z	deitarion	mobilnoob11	Ok, so let me see if I understand the situation. Your system normally freezes, but removing that module stops the fixes, but it kills your wireless support and you need wireless?
2012-06-09T21:36:00.000Z	deitarion	mobilnoob11	Ok. Mind clarifying? I'm obviously missing something.
2012-06-09T21:37:00.000Z	deitarion	mobilnoob11	Ahh. Hmm.
2012-06-09T21:42:00.000Z	deitarion	mobilnoob11	I'm not entirely sure what that specific module is, but it sounds like it's probably your wired ethernet driver and, by removing it, you avoid a bug that's freezing your system.
