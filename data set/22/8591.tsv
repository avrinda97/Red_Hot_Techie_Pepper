2007-01-14T15:29:00.000Z	wick2o		what a tutorial that assumes no errors? that would never happen with a linux tut :)
2007-01-14T15:29:00.000Z	wick2o		sesshomary: edit /etc/apt/source.list
2007-01-14T15:30:00.000Z	wick2o		copy the source line and rename whatever your currently using to edgy?
2007-01-14T15:31:00.000Z	wick2o		copy the current line for cdrom at the top of the list
2007-01-14T15:31:00.000Z	wick2o		and rename dapper (if your using dapper) with edgy
2007-01-14T07:49:00.000Z	wick2o		iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.7.0 -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE
2007-01-14T07:49:00.000Z	wick2o		something like that
2007-01-14T07:49:00.000Z	wick2o		o and echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
2007-01-14T07:51:00.000Z	bluet	wick2o	how about if they're on the same subnet?
2007-01-14T07:51:00.000Z	wick2o		i dont think it matters if they are on the same subnet or not
2007-01-14T07:51:00.000Z	wick2o		or sorry that -s should be -s 10.0.7.0/16
2007-01-14T07:52:00.000Z	wick2o		or /subnet
2007-01-14T07:52:00.000Z	wick2o		my bad with the typo
2007-01-14T07:53:00.000Z	wick2o	bluet	take a look at iptables, i dont think have HAVE to specifiy an ip/subnet...you could do ALL ips/subnets
2007-01-14T07:53:00.000Z	bluet		let's say i have 10.0.0.101 on eth1, connected to my lan, and 10.0.0.2 on eth0, connected to another computer. what exactly do i tell iptables to do to let the other computer access my lan
2007-01-14T07:53:00.000Z	bluet		*
2007-01-14T07:53:00.000Z	bluet		?
2007-01-14T07:54:00.000Z	wick2o		depends, what is the subnet?
2007-01-14T07:54:00.000Z	bluet		10.0.0.0/24
2007-01-14T07:54:00.000Z	bluet		okay
2007-01-14T07:54:00.000Z	bluet		so 192.168.0.0/24 on eth0 for example?
2007-01-14T07:55:00.000Z	wick2o	bluet	umm your still not makeing much sense, why are you using different nics and not a switch?
