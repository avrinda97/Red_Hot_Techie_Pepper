2010-03-15T23:58:00.000Z	solow		I tried #linux, but they dont know... How do I open a folder for browsing in the terminal? *in windows this is start .*
2010-03-15T23:59:00.000Z	Slart	solow	there is "gnome-open"
2010-03-15T23:59:00.000Z	solow	Slart	is this distro language, or linux language. because my code has to work on all linux distros.
2010-03-16T00:00:00.000Z	Slart	solow	if you want to be specific you can also try things like "nautilus" or "thunar"
2010-03-16T00:00:00.000Z	Slart	solow	afaik gnome-open would work if gnome is installed and running.. there's probably something else for KDE or xfce
2010-03-16T00:01:00.000Z	solow	Slart	and gnome is pretty much always there, right? or only on ubuntu?
2010-03-16T00:01:00.000Z	Slart	solow	if you're writing an app that has to open a file browsing window I would suggest making this command configurable.. that way distro's can change it to whatever they want for their packages
2010-03-16T00:02:00.000Z	Slart	solow	Gnome is pretty big.. but so is KDE .. I doubt any desktop enviroment has over 50%
2010-03-16T00:02:00.000Z	solow	Slart	Problem is, i'm working on the php version atm. So it has to be done using command line tool...
2010-03-16T00:03:00.000Z	solow	Slart	is there a command to ask linux what's installed? that way I can use the terminal what to use. :)
2010-03-16T00:04:00.000Z	Slart	solow	there might very well be.. but I don't know it.. it would make sense to have an enviroment variable or similar
2010-03-16T00:05:00.000Z	solow	Slart	well, if i knew what was being used, gnome or kde *what else is there?* i can decide what set of commands to use for the app. it will work on windows, and all distro's of linux
2010-03-16T00:08:00.000Z	Slart	solow	well.. *all* linux distros will be very very hard..  there are linux distros running on small embedded systems.. without any displays at all, with gnome/KDE/xfce/other weird desktop enviroments.. some can use more than one file manager
2010-03-16T00:09:00.000Z	Slart	solow	I think you might want to aim for "most regular desktop" linux systems.. with KDE/Gnome/xfce you'll probably cover 80% or more.. those last percentages will take lots more work
2010-03-16T00:10:00.000Z	solow	Slart	yes. I will. people may request others if they like. but the only problem is, where do i find the system used, and the command for each of these systems. e.g. kde, gnome etc.
2010-03-16T00:11:00.000Z	Slart	solow	as Azelphur suggested.. the lsb modules might be a way.. searching a process list might tell you if gnome/KDE is running.. there might be other ways too
2010-03-16T00:12:00.000Z	Slart	solow	note that just because you run a certain distro doesn't mean you use the default desktop enviroment.. but it might be a pretty good starting guess
2010-06-08T23:49:00.000Z	Slart	solow	xkill, pkill, kill
2010-06-08T23:49:00.000Z	solow	Slart	how?
2010-06-08T23:50:00.000Z	solow	Slart	better even, where? it's running in UI not terminal.
2010-06-08T23:50:00.000Z	Slart	solow	xkill lets you click on a window you want to kill, pkill someprocess  will kill all processes named "someprocess", kil <pid> will kill the process with the process id <pid>
2010-06-08T23:52:00.000Z	Slart	solow	why not try rebooting..see if it comes back
