2007-05-08T13:59:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- you need not change any permissions to run an eggy. depending on where you install it. e.g., ~/homedir
2007-05-08T14:01:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- i know of no one who has gotten the ubuntu eggdrop to work. install from source tarball and edir eggdrop.conf
2007-05-08T14:10:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- get a real copy of eggdrop, tar -zxvf eggdrop.tar.gz then cd eggdrop.xxx then ./configure : make : make install : edit eggdrop.conf. simple.
2007-05-08T14:19:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- it installed in the wrong place.
2007-05-08T14:19:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- it did not install at all imo.
2007-05-08T14:20:00.000Z	cheeseboy	LtL	i did sudo apt-get install eggdrop
2007-05-08T14:20:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- get the source tarball and compile it. the synaptic install or apt-get install eggdrop never worked for anyone i know of.
2007-05-08T14:21:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- it might complain about missing tcl stuff but synaptic has tcl somewhere.
2007-05-08T14:22:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- you cant hurt anything trying
2007-05-08T14:22:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- un-install that synaptic eggy POS
2007-05-08T14:23:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- sudo apt-get autoremove eggdrop
2007-05-08T14:27:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- http://www.eggheads.org/   get your compile-feet wet :)
2007-05-08T14:27:00.000Z	cheeseboy	LtL	build-essential somtin like that?
2007-05-08T14:28:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- yes, you will need build-essential to compile anything
2007-05-08T14:28:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- sudo apt-get install build-essential
2007-05-08T14:30:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- open synaptic and enable universe and multiverse
2007-05-08T14:31:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- it's in the development repo
2007-05-08T14:33:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- try #eggdrop channel. build-essential is definetly available.
2007-05-08T14:34:00.000Z	LtL	cheeseboy	- what is the error?
