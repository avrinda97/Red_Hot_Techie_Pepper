2006-06-18T11:05:00.000Z	nachoWide	affan	i was just there.  it took about 30 min, but it worked
2006-06-18T11:05:00.000Z	nachoWide	affan	but i don't know what to do if it isn't working
2006-06-18T11:06:00.000Z	affan	nachoWide	30 minutes?? wow... ok i will wait
2006-06-18T11:06:00.000Z	nachoWide	affan	but I don't know what to say if it doesn't work, and maybe it doesn't need more time.  maybe its frozen, but it took a long time for me
2006-06-18T11:07:00.000Z	affan		thanks nachoWide
2006-06-18T11:07:00.000Z	nachoWide		can anyone explain how to use a program after using the package installer?  how do i get it to run?
2006-06-18T11:08:00.000Z	affan	nachoWide	which program did you install?
2006-06-18T11:08:00.000Z	nachoWide		keepassx
2006-06-18T11:08:00.000Z	affan	nachoWide	if its a GNOME program it might be in the menus. Otherwise you can add it to the menus
2006-06-18T11:09:00.000Z	nachoWide	affan	 not in the menu
2006-06-18T11:09:00.000Z	affan	nachoWide	can you run it via the terminal?
2006-06-18T11:09:00.000Z	affan	nachoWide	just enter the name of the program on the command prompt
2006-06-18T11:10:00.000Z	nachoWide	affan	typing 'keepassx' doesn't work
2006-06-18T11:11:00.000Z	affan	nachoWide	wat does the program do? is there a website for that software? i am not familiar with the program itself
2006-06-18T11:11:00.000Z	nachoWide	affan	 password storage.  http://keepass.sourceforge.net/
2006-06-18T11:12:00.000Z	affan	nachoWide	does this help? http://keepassx.sourceforge.net/en/howto.html
2006-06-18T11:13:00.000Z	affan		[Ex0r] : exit
2006-06-18T11:13:00.000Z	nachoWide	affan	sure, but I just don't understand where the program is supposed to be located
2006-06-18T11:14:00.000Z	affan	nachoWide	I believe if its on the PATH it should be visible by typing: which keepassx
2006-06-18T11:14:00.000Z	affan		[Ex0r] : try Ctrl + Alt + F7
2006-06-18T11:18:00.000Z	nachoWide	affan	sorry, i'm new to the whole installing process.  i used the DEB release, which is all graphical.  it shows all the directories where the files were unpacked, but i don't see how to run the thing
