2010-03-28T21:14:00.000Z	myrl		yes or no?
2010-03-28T21:14:00.000Z	blakkheim	myrl	maybe they don't want ubuntu users being spied on :)
2010-03-28T21:15:00.000Z	myrl	blakkheim	what do you mean?
2010-03-28T21:15:00.000Z	blakkheim	myrl	we were discussing why ubuntu on a mac would be any different
2010-03-28T21:16:00.000Z	myrl	blakkheim	I mean why do you think google chrome spies on ubuntu users????
2010-03-28T21:16:00.000Z	blakkheim	myrl	that's a bit offtopic for this channel, but do some research
2010-03-28T21:24:00.000Z	blakkheim	myrl	manually editing the source of chromium and/or using iron?
2010-03-28T21:24:00.000Z	myrl	blakkheim	no its in the options menu :P
2010-03-28T21:25:00.000Z	blakkheim	myrl	i wouldn't trust something like that in a proprietary program
2010-03-28T21:25:00.000Z	myrl	blakkheim	why
2010-03-28T21:25:00.000Z	blakkheim	myrl	because it's proprietary, you don't know what it's *actually* doing
2010-03-28T21:26:00.000Z	myrl	blakkheim	but google is pretty trustworthy
2010-03-28T21:27:00.000Z	myrl	blakkheim	chrome is chromium!!!
2010-03-28T21:27:00.000Z	blakkheim	myrl	no, actually they are different
2010-03-28T21:27:00.000Z	myrl	blakkheim	but they both are open source
2010-03-28T21:28:00.000Z	blakkheim	myrl	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_%28web_browser%29#Differences_between_Chromium_and_Google_Chrome
2010-03-28T21:29:00.000Z	myrl	blakkheim	and how do you know the dude who wrote this in wikipedia isn't you?
2010-03-28T21:30:00.000Z	blakkheim	myrl	lol, i'm not going to argue about it. do some research and continue in #ubuntu-offtopic
2010-03-28T21:30:00.000Z	myrl	blakkheim	ok rofl
