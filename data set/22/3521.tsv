2009-03-09T18:57:00.000Z	blip-		hi all,  every time I boot the machine I usually issue the command "sudo hdparm -B 255 /dev/sda"... instead of doing this manually and entering the password everytime,  I added "hdparm -B 255 /dev/sda" to /etc/rc.local but it isn't running the command. any ideas ?   thanks
2009-03-09T18:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	blip-	see /etc/hdparm.conf
2009-03-10T00:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	blip-	no problem
2009-05-26T22:30:00.000Z	blip-	erUSUL	the keyword is the hex value I get in the error right ?

2009-05-26T22:38:00.000Z	blip-	erUSUL	I followed the first 2 steps successfully.. but when I issue "sudo apt-get add -" it hangs there forever after I enter my pass

2009-08-26T02:10:00.000Z	blip-	erUSUL	ok thanks.  I have a 9.04 xubuntu from few months ago, can I just install that or do iso's get updated as well ?
2009-08-26T02:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	blip-	install that... isos are not updated

2010-08-25T15:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	blip-	ask in #upstart maybe you need to do a upstart job that will be a precondition for /etc/init/gdm.conf
