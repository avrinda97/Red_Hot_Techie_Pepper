2006-09-25T05:33:00.000Z	Who_		Deep_, Sprafa: Linux cannot write reliabley to ntfs so a /home on ntfs would be a bad idea/ probably impossible
2006-09-25T05:34:00.000Z	Who_		deep_:what is ntfs-3g?
2006-09-25T05:35:00.000Z	Who_		is it good?
2006-09-25T05:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	Who_	have backups, as it is reportedly ujnreliable, you lose everything
2006-09-25T05:36:00.000Z	Who_	eyequeue	I have once ext3 disk here failing, that's enough for me
2006-09-25T06:09:00.000Z	eyequeue	Who_	i can't explain the why, but i found it works once, but on reinstall (of edgy, over and over) it doesn't sense them
2006-09-25T06:10:00.000Z	eyequeue	Who_	it's as if it is a "one-shot deal" somehow
2006-09-25T06:10:00.000Z	Who_	eyequeue	yea, I think it uses whatever is _in_ the bootloader somehow
2006-09-25T06:10:00.000Z	Who_	eyequeue	I mean the bootsector: time for bed :P
2006-09-25T06:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	Who_	ahh, could be, i had dapper there at first *nod*
2006-09-25T06:11:00.000Z	Who_	eyequeue	yea, I don't know when I lost all mine though... curious
2006-09-25T06:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	Who_	i think you solved my mystery, thanks :)
2006-09-25T06:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	Who_	can you boot to some other os via rescue cd, and run grub from that first?
2006-09-25T06:12:00.000Z	Who_	eyequeue	the rescue CD? I dunno, tell me more :)
2006-09-25T06:13:00.000Z	eyequeue	Who_	say you have a working menu.lst on suse, boot to suse and update-grub, then to ubuntu and do so :)
2006-09-25T06:14:00.000Z	eyequeue	Who_	saying that poorly, but the idea was to get the os's into the bootsector so it can find them, if that helps
2006-09-25T06:14:00.000Z	Who_	eyequeue	:) yea, but how do I boot to grub (in fact, I am just going to swipe the relevant lines from the menu.lst on Suse's boot partition :))
2006-09-25T06:15:00.000Z	eyequeue	Who_	yeah, i paste lines from edgy into dapper and vice versa, every time one or the other has a new kernel
2006-09-25T06:16:00.000Z	eyequeue	Who_	after the -- ?  will dad's "rescue" be seen there?
2006-09-25T06:17:00.000Z	Who_	eyequeue	I don't know - perhaps I don't rememberthe live CD boot very well....
2006-09-25T06:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	Who_	it consused me, it seems to ignore the rescue bootparam, but maybe that's because it has a special initrd on that line already?
2006-09-25T06:19:00.000Z	Who_	eyequeue	that's beyond me :)
