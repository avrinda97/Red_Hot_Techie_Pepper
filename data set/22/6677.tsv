2007-08-28T15:54:00.000Z	thedash		man, LInux sucks for media players
2007-08-28T15:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thedash	why?
2007-08-28T15:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thedash	tried beep?
2007-08-28T15:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thedash	what's wrong with it, then?
2007-08-28T15:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thedash	I mean if you can describe pretty clearly what you do and don't like, maybe someone can improve it
2007-08-28T15:57:00.000Z	thedash	gordonjcp	:: the main problem with beep is that it's unsupported and not being updated
2007-08-28T15:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thedash	maybe you can improve it ;-)
2007-08-28T15:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thedash	pretty much everyone has moved onto rhythmbox or amarok these days
2007-08-28T15:58:00.000Z	thedash	gordonjcp	:: amarok is probably my favourite of the bunch, but it's not very personable
2007-08-28T15:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thedash	uhm, what makes you think it's no longer updated, anyway?
2007-08-28T15:58:00.000Z	thedash	gordonjcp	:: that's what I was told a while ago ?
2007-08-28T15:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thedash	oh right, it's not been updated in two weeks so it's not updated any more? ;-)
2007-08-28T15:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thedash	some of my projects have gone over a year without a tarball release... ;-)
2007-08-29T16:05:00.000Z	thedash	gordonjcp	:: you know any reason why bmp doesn't seem to like the year or tracknumber tags ?
2007-08-29T16:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thedash	nope
2007-08-29T16:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thedash	file a bug?
2007-08-29T16:06:00.000Z	thedash	gordonjcp	:: not sure what to describe it as, the 'year' tag shows the first character, nothing more, and the 'tag' is empty
2007-08-29T16:06:00.000Z	thedash	gordonjcp	:: maybe bmp doesn't like unicode tags ?
2007-08-29T16:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thedash	could be
2007-08-29T16:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thedash	try straight ascii tags, and see if that solves it
2007-08-29T16:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thedash	basically the more evidence you can give them, the more likely they are to be able to fix your bug
2007-09-02T15:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	thedash	it just seems a bit pointless, and a waste of effort and indeed CPU cycles
