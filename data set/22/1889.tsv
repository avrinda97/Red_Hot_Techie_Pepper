2009-12-09T13:33:00.000Z	help_livecduser		hey PND
2009-12-09T13:33:00.000Z	PND	help_livecduser	can you explain your problem ?
2009-12-09T13:34:00.000Z	help_livecduser	PND	could i pm u ?
2009-12-09T13:36:00.000Z	PND	help_livecduser	are you common with Linux ?
2009-12-09T13:38:00.000Z	PND	help_livecduser	it shouldn't be linked with this problem. It's weird actually.
2009-12-09T13:39:00.000Z	PND	help_livecduser	you're on the livecd right now ?
2009-12-09T13:40:00.000Z	PND	help_livecduser	can you launch a gparted editor ? Maybe this one is buggy (would be weird, but you should try)
2009-12-09T13:41:00.000Z	help_livecduser	PND	hmm k wait. .
2009-12-09T13:42:00.000Z	help_livecduser	PND	its still weird there. lemme grab a screenshot n upload.. stay here. need ur help :)
2009-12-09T13:44:00.000Z	PND	help_livecduser	i'm staying here.
2009-12-09T13:44:00.000Z	help_livecduser	PND	here is the screenshot - one partition is missing.. http://i49.tinypic.com/ossy83.png n one is shown weirdly big ..
2009-12-09T13:46:00.000Z	PND	help_livecduser	which util did you used for partition it ?
2009-12-09T13:48:00.000Z	PND	help_livecduser	since ubuntu can't say exactly where you partitions are, I won't do that.
2009-12-09T13:50:00.000Z	PND	help_livecduser	I would save data and partition it again with gparted or fdisk... But that's maybe pretty hard.
2009-12-09T13:51:00.000Z	help_livecduser	PND	that means whole loads of backup n reinstalling windows 2 b safe.. :(
2009-12-09T13:52:00.000Z	PND	help_livecduser	that's why it's a hard solution. Maybe there's something to do to "fix" it... But I won't do that with ubuntu, since it can't detect partition table. Follow the zcat[1] advice and use the Windows tool and try to fix it.
2009-12-09T13:53:00.000Z	PND	help_livecduser	i'm here for about an hour.
2009-12-09T13:53:00.000Z	help_livecduser	PND	thanks. cming back in sme time.. :)
