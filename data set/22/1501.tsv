2010-05-11T02:51:00.000Z	Loshki	alzamabar	I don't believe you can use disk identifier. You need to identify individual partitions within the disk anyway, not the entire disk....
2010-05-11T02:51:00.000Z	Loshki	alzamabar	no kidding...
2010-05-11T02:52:00.000Z	alzamabar	Loshki	what do you suggest to guarantee the order in which my devices get mounted?
2010-05-11T02:54:00.000Z	Loshki	alzamabar	to be absolutely certain of the mount order, you need to list the mount commands one after another in /etc/rc.local. Why is the mount order so important to you?
2010-05-11T02:54:00.000Z	alzamabar	Loshki	because given two disks, A and B, sometimes A contains the content of B and viceversa
2010-05-11T02:56:00.000Z	Loshki	alzamabar	I'm not sure what you mean by "sometimes A contains the content of B and viceversa". Do you mean the disks get mounted to the wrong directories sometimes? You can prevent that by using UUIDs...
2010-05-11T02:56:00.000Z	alzamabar	Loshki	that's right. How do I find the UUID of my external devices?
2010-05-11T02:57:00.000Z	alzamabar	Loshki	or to be more precise, the UUID of the partitions within my external drives?
2010-05-11T02:58:00.000Z	Loshki	alzamabar	connect the devices and then run sudo blkid and paste the output into a file...
2010-05-11T02:58:00.000Z	alzamabar	Loshki	thx
2010-05-11T02:58:00.000Z	alzamabar	Loshki	got it. I'll now use UUID in /etc/fstab
2010-05-11T03:03:00.000Z	alzamabar	Loshki	this is completely nuts. Please have a look at http://pastebin.com/Ksq4P1Ke
2010-05-11T03:04:00.000Z	alzamabar	Loshki	this is my /etc/fstab: http://pastebin.com/uvyT84jz
2010-05-11T03:04:00.000Z	Loshki	alzamabar	what's nuts about it? It looks ok...
2010-05-11T03:07:00.000Z	Loshki	alzamabar	what happens when you type "df -h' ?
2010-05-11T03:07:00.000Z	alzamabar	Loshki	sec
2010-05-11T03:08:00.000Z	alzamabar	Loshki	http://pastebin.com/Wj9rYvcW. It appears I've got the same disk mounted twice
2010-05-11T03:09:00.000Z	alzamabar	Loshki	ok I unmounted all of them, remounted and now it seems ok
2010-05-11T03:10:00.000Z	alzamabar	Loshki	wow that was some new experience
2010-05-11T03:10:00.000Z	Loshki	alzamabar	next time you boot, it should work ok as long as the fstab is correct...
2010-05-11T03:10:00.000Z	alzamabar	Loshki	thx for your help
2010-05-11T03:12:00.000Z	Loshki	alzamabar	a pleasure,,,'
