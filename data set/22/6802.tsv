2009-03-21T02:47:00.000Z	dik	sebsebseb	any ideas? is there a general problem with browsers?

2009-03-21T02:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dik	have you tried another browser?
2009-03-21T02:49:00.000Z	dik	sebsebseb	 I can't get online to download.....:-)
2009-03-21T02:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dik	you  don't need a browser, to download programs into Ubuntu :D
2009-03-21T02:50:00.000Z	dik	sebsebseb	what is the code, I assume this is done in term?
2009-03-21T02:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dik	yeah exactly, your meant to  get most programs off Ubuntu's server.   either via the command line,  or the slow graphical way
2009-03-21T02:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dik	two slow graphical ways to choose from
2009-03-21T02:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dik	sudo apt-get install  galeon  ephipany-browser
2009-03-21T02:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dik	epiphany probably won't add itself to the menu,  but you can open it by  running epiphany-browser from the terminal once installed.  and  galeon is rather nice as well :)
2009-03-21T02:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dik	plus there are quite a few other browsers I could have told you to install :d
2009-03-21T02:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dik	that are all good as well
2009-03-21T02:54:00.000Z	dik	sebsebseb	thanks a lot, I will see wht occurs
2009-03-21T02:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dik	are you on that computer using IRC?
