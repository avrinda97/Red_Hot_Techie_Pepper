2004-12-12T17:08:00.000Z	mintSlice		sure.
2004-12-12T17:08:00.000Z	mintSlice		Will the lack of selinux in Ubuntu cause problems with the /home filesystem (ext3)
2004-12-12T17:09:00.000Z	Matt|	mintSlice	uh no
2004-12-12T17:09:00.000Z	Matt|	mintSlice	far from it
2004-12-12T17:09:00.000Z	mintSlice	Matt|	what do you mean 'far from it'
2004-12-12T17:10:00.000Z	Matt|	mintSlice	i mean, the two concepts are unrelated
2004-12-12T17:10:00.000Z	Matt|	mintSlice	what sort of problems did you have in mind?
2004-12-12T17:11:00.000Z	mintSlice	Matt|	even if the /home partition was created using FC3 which includes selinux support
2004-12-12T17:11:00.000Z	Matt|	mintSlice	right. well you won't have any problems due to that. Many some others tho
2004-12-12T17:12:00.000Z	Matt|	mintSlice	you have kept your files from the fedora install?
2004-12-12T17:12:00.000Z	mintSlice	Matt|	I'm concerned because the Ubuntu installer has some issues with /home partition during the install
2004-12-12T17:12:00.000Z	Matt|	mintSlice	are you keeping files from the fedora installation?
2004-12-12T17:12:00.000Z	mintSlice	Matt|	what do you mean, have I kept my files for the FC install?
2004-12-12T17:13:00.000Z	Matt|	mintSlice	are you deleting the partition or keeping the files?
2004-12-12T17:13:00.000Z	mintSlice	Matt|	I want to be able to access the files from both Ubuntu and FC3
2004-12-12T17:13:00.000Z	Matt|	mintSlice	*laughs*
2004-12-12T17:14:00.000Z	Matt|	mintSlice	not gonna be fun: fedora and ubuntu have different versions of some programs I imagine, so the configuration files in the /home directory will cause loads of problems
2004-12-12T17:14:00.000Z	Matt|	mintSlice	what you wanna do is get a partition to share between the systems, but not mount it at /home. Maybe mount it at /data or something
2004-12-12T17:15:00.000Z	Matt|	mintSlice	there are lots of secret files in your home directory
2004-12-12T17:15:00.000Z	Matt|	mintSlice	see them by doing "ls -a"
2004-12-12T17:16:00.000Z	Matt|	mintSlice	those are also probably quite different versions
2004-12-12T17:17:00.000Z	Matt|	mintSlice	well you can try but i wouldn't recommend it. anyhow the selinux thing will not be a problem: ubuntu doesn't implement it
