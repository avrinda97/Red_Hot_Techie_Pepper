2007-06-16T13:16:00.000Z	ny152		Hi Room, can someone please help me with a network problem :(
2007-06-16T13:16:00.000Z	_Andrew	ny152	Ask your question and everyone will try and help you
2007-06-16T13:16:00.000Z	ny152	_Andrew	Thanks, Here goes...
2007-06-16T13:22:00.000Z	_Andrew	ny152	what did you type to ping your xp box from ubuntu?
2007-06-16T13:22:00.000Z	ny152	_Andrew	I typed ping 192.168.0.2
2007-06-16T13:23:00.000Z	_Andrew	ny152	weird. Are you trying to do something specific?
2007-06-16T13:24:00.000Z	ny152	_Andrew	I am trying to setup a basic network here. Pinging both ways is a very obvious thing to see if all is fine, isnt it?
2007-06-16T13:25:00.000Z	ny152	_Andrew	SInce you asked if I am trying to do something specific -- my ultimate aim is to be able to do a vnc connect from my xp box to ubuntu.
2007-06-16T13:26:00.000Z	ny152	_Andrew	Can I PM you?
2007-06-16T13:27:00.000Z	_Andrew	ny152	Is your windows firewall on?
2007-06-16T13:27:00.000Z	ny152	_Andrew	Yes.
2007-06-16T13:28:00.000Z	ny152	_Andrew	I would also like to mention this -- When I do a ping from my windows XP installation from the same machine (which is booted in ubuntu now) I am able to ping both ways to the XP notebook..
2007-06-16T13:29:00.000Z	_Andrew	ny152	Maybe your notebook hates Ubuntu?
2007-06-16T13:30:00.000Z	ny152	_Andrew	Anyway I can make it otherwise :P
2007-06-16T13:30:00.000Z	_Andrew	ny152	Does file sharing work etc?
2007-06-16T13:30:00.000Z	_Andrew	ny152	You can connect to the machine at all?
2007-06-16T13:30:00.000Z	ny152	_Andrew	No. doesnt work.
2007-06-16T13:32:00.000Z	ny152	_Andrew	I am just able to ping the xp notebook, thats all
2007-06-16T13:32:00.000Z	_Andrew	ny152	I'm confused I thought you couldn't ping your notebook
2007-06-16T13:33:00.000Z	ny152	_Andrew	my apologies, I got confused
2007-06-16T13:43:00.000Z	ny152	_Andrew	Jamman: Any help?
