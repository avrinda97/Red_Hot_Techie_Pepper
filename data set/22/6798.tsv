2009-09-25T02:47:00.000Z	Timarvay		Hey, just burned an Ubuntu disk and I'm using it to run this. Anyone wanna play tech support for me?
2009-09-25T02:49:00.000Z	Timarvay		Ah. So, I just started using Ubuntu. I want to dual boot it with Windows XP, but I have issues with my XP install. Namely, I can't do anything with it because of a virus. Can't even boot into safemode. Is there someway to partition things so I don't uninstall it by I have a working Ubuntu install?
2009-09-25T02:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	ok if you got malware installed into any OS, the only true way to make sure it is gone, is to clean install th OS
2009-09-25T02:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	dual booting with an infected XP install doesn't sound that good,  even though your Windows virus won't infect Ubuntu
2009-09-25T02:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	If you have enough RAM and depending on what Windows programs you want to run,  you can do a Windows virtual machine inside Ubuntu, and then if you get a virus or whatever again, you can  easilly delete it like a normal file,  and use a clean backup or re install.   Also Wine can run many Windows programs in Ubuntu.
2009-09-25T02:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	you should  sort out that infected XP install really as well, by either  attempting to clean it, or  by re installing.
2009-09-25T02:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	and it makes things a bit easier if Windows is installed first, when doing dual boots
2009-09-25T02:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	ok as long as Windows was shut down properly, should be able to access it's partition, no problem, and then gain access to data that you can back up :)  and re install the OS,  a psyical install or virtual machine.   You can also try deleting infected files using the Live CD.
2009-09-25T02:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	well it got infected, you should do a clean install of the OS  really it's as simple as that,  it could be doing quite a few bad things now, when it's loaded up and connected to the Internet.
2009-09-25T03:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	yep take computer security  seriously,  Ubuntu, other Linux distros, BSD,   Windows,  Mac OS X, and so on, none of them are 100% immune to malware
2009-09-25T03:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	which games?
2009-09-25T03:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	ok I hear Steam works in Wine,  and  old game so non 3D?
2009-09-25T03:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	I think you will be ok, and not have a proper reason to have Windows on dual boot
2009-09-25T03:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	indeed
2009-09-25T03:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	also  Windows virtual machine :)  as long as you got enough RAM
2009-09-25T03:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	yes, but make sure you got your stuff first
2009-09-25T03:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	places > computer and you should be able to access the Windows partition
2009-09-25T03:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	oh right yeah that's a point, you need to move the data to some where else
2009-09-25T03:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	or make a new partition, or delete everything from the Windows partition except the data,  I have done that before
2009-09-25T03:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	well when I did it wasn't exactly data, but this is irelivant.   Ok you only got one CD drive?
2009-09-25T03:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	USB stick?  external hard disk?
2009-09-25T03:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Timarvay	see my pm
