2005-07-05T09:45:00.000Z	nekohayo		sudo modprobe?
2005-07-05T09:45:00.000Z	nekohayo		I "think"
2005-07-05T09:46:00.000Z	nekohayo		don't really know, kakalto
2005-07-05T09:46:00.000Z	nekohayo		hmm I wonder how
2005-07-05T09:47:00.000Z	nekohayo		oh, HAL ?
2005-07-05T09:47:00.000Z	nekohayo		(hardware abstraction layer)
2005-07-05T09:47:00.000Z	nekohayo		I'd like to know how to probe hardware, too
2005-07-05T09:48:00.000Z	nekohayo		yeah, a monitor is not really picky.
2005-07-05T09:48:00.000Z	nekohayo		just take a look at windows, with its "generic plug and play monitor" XD
2005-07-05T09:50:00.000Z	nekohayo		holy COW! I just realized at last (after 5 years of people telling me refresh rates DO make a difference) that it was true XD went from 60 to 75hz, and since then, I don't see the refreshing when I'm looking at 45degrees
2005-07-05T09:52:00.000Z	IceDC571	nekohayo	try using the same refresh rate tips on LCDs.. it wont make a difference
2005-07-05T09:52:00.000Z	IceDC571	nekohayo	no.. higher is still better, its just not as bad
2005-07-05T09:53:00.000Z	IceDC571	nekohayo	ohhh you mean the ms refresh rate, right :)
2005-07-05T09:53:00.000Z	nekohayo	IceDC571	?
2005-07-05T09:59:00.000Z	IceDC571	nekohayo	i love canada
2005-07-05T10:01:00.000Z	IceDC571	nekohayo	pretty much, it depends, you might want to make sure your xorg matches the new specs of your LCD.. 60hz is good for a refresh rate
2005-07-05T10:02:00.000Z	IceDC571	nekohayo	also the vertical and horizontal rates are important to write down.. once you have all that information, the image will fit the LCD perfectly with no need for adjusting
2005-07-05T10:03:00.000Z	IceDC571	nekohayo	yeah, thats the only downside
2005-07-05T10:04:00.000Z	IceDC571	nekohayo	thats why gaming sucks when you use a lower resolution on LCD
2005-07-05T10:05:00.000Z	IceDC571	nekohayo	use a higher dpi for your fonts
2005-07-05T10:05:00.000Z	IceDC571	nekohayo	prob solved!
2005-07-05T10:07:00.000Z	IceDC571	nekohayo	you shouldn't see a difference without further tweaking
