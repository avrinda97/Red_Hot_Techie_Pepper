2007-05-22T05:12:00.000Z	archan		is anyone here good with getting windows drives to automount in ubuntu?
2007-05-22T05:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	archan	what do you mean windows drives.  Ntfs drives?
2007-05-22T05:12:00.000Z	archan		yes, a ntfs drive
2007-05-22T05:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	archan	are you running fiesty or dapper or edgy
2007-05-22T05:13:00.000Z	archan		all I can do is get it to automount - but owned by root and without permisions to view
2007-05-22T05:13:00.000Z	archan		fiesty - and I do know the /dev/ tree, yep!
2007-05-22T05:13:00.000Z	Scunizi		!fstab | archan
2007-05-22T05:14:00.000Z	archan		this might help more... last time I messed with the fstab I got my resolution stuck to 640x480 - heh
2007-05-22T05:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	archan	I could give you one of the lines I have in my fstab for dapper ntfs partitions.  That might help.
2007-05-22T05:15:00.000Z	archan		hmm
2007-05-22T05:15:00.000Z	archan		would you recommend the NTFS Fuse module?
2007-05-22T05:16:00.000Z	Scunizi	archan	/dev/sda1    /media/sda1    ntfs   defaults,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46  0  1
2007-05-22T05:16:00.000Z	Scunizi	archan	your messages get lost in the noise if you don't mention my nick in the post.
2007-05-22T05:17:00.000Z	archan		ooh, gotcha Scunizi
2007-05-22T05:17:00.000Z	Scunizi	archan	never used the fuse module.... I'm on dapper by the way. so my fstab might look a little different.
2007-05-22T05:17:00.000Z	archan	Scunizi	the diskmounter script got it up and running for me, going to see how it works writing into it
2007-05-22T05:17:00.000Z	Scunizi	archan	you can also type part of a nick and then hit tab. Some Irc clients will attempt to finish it fo ryou.
2007-05-22T05:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	archan	 are you dual booting with winxx?
2007-05-22T05:18:00.000Z	archan	Scunizi	the tab trick works, thanks! No writing capabilities, but I can read off of it
2007-05-22T05:19:00.000Z	archan	Scunizi	thank you kindly, your links worked. don't know why I couldn't find it on my own. Guess I'm rustier than I thought - thank you again!
2007-05-22T05:19:00.000Z	Scunizi		no prob.
2007-05-22T05:19:00.000Z	Scunizi	archan	no prob
