2010-01-16T04:22:00.000Z	CAPcap		holy moly... what just happened?
2010-01-16T04:22:00.000Z	CAPcap		hello? is anyone still here?
2010-01-16T04:23:00.000Z	blakkheim	CAPcap	no
2010-01-18T01:44:00.000Z	blakkheim	CAPcap	what type of video, what video player, what cpu?
2010-01-22T07:47:00.000Z	blakkheim	CAPcap	lsusb
2010-01-22T23:51:00.000Z	blakkheim	CAPcap	that shouldn't happen. perhaps you've been rooted?
2010-01-22T23:51:00.000Z	blakkheim	CAPcap	hacked, in other words. someone else may be doing it.
2010-01-22T23:52:00.000Z	blakkheim	CAPcap	is this a server or just regular desktop?
2010-01-22T23:52:00.000Z	blakkheim	CAPcap	if you run "sudo passwd yourusername" and change it, see if it reverts back again later.
2010-01-25T00:22:00.000Z	blakkheim	CAPcap	that's like asking to upgrade from fedora to slackware
2010-01-25T00:23:00.000Z	blakkheim	CAPcap	find out what applications the "studio" version comes with and just install those
2010-01-25T00:23:00.000Z	CAPcap	blakkheim	i was just wondering
2010-01-25T00:24:00.000Z	CAPcap	blakkheim	I dont have 3D support I guess here and a friend of mine using studio thought i might have better luck with that. he says it recognizes and supports his hardware better.
2010-01-25T00:25:00.000Z	blakkheim	CAPcap	it supports HIS hardware better, not yours. it is the same system, just with different applications and settings
2010-01-25T00:27:00.000Z	CAPcap	blakkheim	I understand that. the applications wont run for me though. well blender wont. in errors out with a segmentation fault.
2010-01-28T07:48:00.000Z	blakkheim	CAPcap	uninstall it, dl the source of that version, compile it
2010-01-28T07:49:00.000Z	blakkheim	CAPcap	yes
2010-02-06T07:07:00.000Z	blakkheim	CAPcap	look through your installed packages for kde stuff and get rid of them
2010-02-06T07:07:00.000Z	CAPcap	blakkheim	like in synaptic? k thanks
2010-02-06T07:07:00.000Z	blakkheim	CAPcap	you can use that but i was going to use something better like dpkg+aptitude
2010-02-06T07:19:00.000Z	blakkheim	CAPcap	dpkg --get-selections
2010-02-06T07:19:00.000Z	CAPcap	blakkheim	thanks
