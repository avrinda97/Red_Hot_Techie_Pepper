2005-11-27T13:56:00.000Z	jenda		Any reiserfs gurus around?
2005-11-27T11:12:00.000Z	jenda		Can anyone help me mount a partition on startup?
2005-11-27T11:14:00.000Z	sethk	jenda	it is best to stay away from reiserfs
2005-12-19T14:40:00.000Z	sethk	jenda	there is one dangerous linux virus around
2005-12-19T14:40:00.000Z	sethk	jenda	although I've only come across it in docs, never in the flesh
2005-12-19T14:40:00.000Z	jenda	sethk	And it's called MS Windows
2005-12-19T14:41:00.000Z	sethk	jenda	ok, two then.  :)
2005-12-19T14:41:00.000Z	jenda	sethk	Mac OS? DOS?
2005-12-19T14:41:00.000Z	sethk	jenda	there is one dangerous email virus that hits linux, although it is of course patched and fixed
2005-12-19T14:42:00.000Z	sethk	jenda	so only old installations are vulnerable
2005-12-19T14:42:00.000Z	jenda	sethk	Of course - a single virus can never live long.
2005-12-19T14:43:00.000Z	sethk	jenda	hey, some windows viruses have been around for six, seven years now.  :)
2005-12-31T13:26:00.000Z	sethk	jenda	there are more free programs that manipulate ps than pdf
2005-12-31T13:29:00.000Z	jenda	sethk	Yes I know. Thanks anyway. Hmm... what I need is communication with the printer. I will first ask what format they support.
2005-12-31T13:30:00.000Z	sethk	jenda	cups converts everything to postscript, so if you are using CUPS ...
2005-12-31T13:33:00.000Z	jenda	sethk	what about EPS format? I know they support that. Is it an open format, or is it at least supported by a FOSS program?
2005-12-31T13:33:00.000Z	sethk	jenda	EPS is just a postscript extension
2005-12-31T13:33:00.000Z	jenda	sethk	OK, and that means I can use that?
2005-12-31T13:33:00.000Z	sethk	jenda	just about everything you would use supports EPS
2005-12-31T13:34:00.000Z	sethk	jenda	yes, you can use it.
2005-12-31T13:35:00.000Z	sethk	jenda	I don't really know anything about callisto, sorry
2006-08-20T13:35:00.000Z	jenda	sethk	Marex, how about Marex invites me for dinner and i testify? ;) Can't be too far.
