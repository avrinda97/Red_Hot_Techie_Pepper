2008-12-04T17:11:00.000Z	sajuuk		hey guys trying to dual screen... ubuntu sees my two screens in the screen resolution manager in System>Preferences, but nothing is happening, what should I do?
2008-12-04T17:11:00.000Z	meganox	sajuuk	man xrandr
2008-12-04T17:15:00.000Z	meganox	sajuuk	xrandr is a command line utility for dealin with dual monitors.  AFAIK GUI tools in gnome aren't complete yet

2008-12-04T17:29:00.000Z	meganox	sajuuk	good link, once you work out what xrandr comands you need it's easy to write a wrapper scipt
2008-12-04T17:30:00.000Z	meganox	sajuuk	section the virtual screen in the link you posted
2008-12-04T17:31:00.000Z	sajuuk	meganox	what?  I dont understand
2008-12-04T17:32:00.000Z	meganox	sajuuk	Virtual should be the only thing you need to add to xorg.conf.  you need to see if your screens will fit within the max allowed by your graphics card, probably easier one below the other

2008-12-04T17:36:00.000Z	meganox	sajuuk	srry took me a while to find
2008-12-04T17:37:00.000Z	meganox	sajuuk	lots of tutorials tell you to change xorg.conf, they are mostly out of date, if yu use xrandr you only need to add Virtual
2008-12-04T17:37:00.000Z	sajuuk	meganox	i will pastebin to show you wot i mean

2008-12-04T17:47:00.000Z	meganox	sajuuk	i don't know where to find the max Virtual resolution your card supports though
2008-12-04T17:47:00.000Z	meganox	sajuuk	you may only be able to stack your screens one above the other if they are wide
2008-12-04T17:58:00.000Z	sajuuk	meganox	I thank you
2008-12-04T18:02:00.000Z	sajuuk	meganox	my hat is off to you
2008-12-04T18:02:00.000Z	meganox	sajuuk	glad it worked, i crashed X when i did it ;)
