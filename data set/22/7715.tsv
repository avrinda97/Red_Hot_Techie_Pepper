2006-01-26T14:17:00.000Z	unl3ss		hey guys, quick question... how do I locate my dvd-rom drive so I can turn it's DMA on?
2006-01-26T14:17:00.000Z	unl3ss		'cause, quite simply, I can't find it
2006-01-26T14:18:00.000Z	plett	unl3ss	dmesg|grep hd
2006-01-26T14:18:00.000Z	plett	unl3ss	assuming it's an ide drive
2006-01-26T14:20:00.000Z	unl3ss	plett	SCSI, okay
2006-01-26T14:20:00.000Z	unl3ss	plett	Well, it's an IBM
2006-01-26T14:22:00.000Z	plett	unl3ss	if it really is scsi, it probably doesn't need dma turning on
2006-01-26T14:23:00.000Z	unl3ss	plett	The problem is really with my DVD play back... it sucks. Heaps of artifacts, it's really slow... and that's the only solution I'm reading on the boards.
2006-01-26T14:24:00.000Z	plett	unl3ss	that sounds more like a cpu power or video drivers thing
2006-01-26T14:25:00.000Z	unl3ss	plett	Do the fglrx drivers mess up DVD playback?
2006-01-26T14:28:00.000Z	plett	unl3ss	i've not heard of any problems, but i don't use them myself
2006-01-26T14:29:00.000Z	unl3ss	plett	Well, alright... but how do I find where my dvd drive is located on my system?
2006-01-26T14:30:00.000Z	plett	unl3ss	if scd0 is correct, /dev/scd0 will be the device file for it
2006-01-26T14:30:00.000Z	unl3ss	plett	Alright, and I should not be able to access it like it was a directory, right? I have to mount it first, right?
2006-01-26T14:31:00.000Z	plett	unl3ss	you can already read files from the drive?
2006-01-26T14:33:00.000Z	unl3ss	plett	and when the dvd is "playing" I keep getting errors that "main decoder error: decoder is leaking pictures, resetting the heap"
2006-01-26T14:34:00.000Z	plett	unl3ss	i've not seen that message before, but i don't use vlc or those glx drivers
2006-01-26T14:34:00.000Z	plett	unl3ss	but it does sound like it's whatever is doing the mpeg decoding
2006-01-26T14:35:00.000Z	unl3ss	plett	Alright, just as long as it's not the drive I can work on it. Thanks for the help!
2006-01-26T14:38:00.000Z	unl3ss	plett	Got it, just downgraded my libdvdcss
2006-01-26T14:38:00.000Z	plett	unl3ss	ahh. glad it's fixed. odd that downgrading made it work better though
2006-01-26T14:38:00.000Z	unl3ss	plett	Yeah, to most of my problems lately downgrading has worked. Particularly with wine, of all things.
