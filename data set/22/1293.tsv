2010-09-09T03:54:00.000Z	RealOpty		sup
2010-09-09T03:55:00.000Z	RealOpty		so there i am looking at lscpu
2010-09-09T03:55:00.000Z	RealOpty		then i see CPU op-mode(s):        64-bit
2010-09-09T03:55:00.000Z	RealOpty		does that mean my cpu is a 64bit processor?
2010-09-09T03:56:00.000Z	RealOpty		I see
2010-09-09T03:56:00.000Z	RealOpty		ive been running 32 bit cause i never thought it was a 64 bit processor
2010-09-09T03:56:00.000Z	RealOpty		nope.
2010-09-09T03:57:00.000Z	egsome	RealOpty	What processor do you have ?
2010-09-09T03:57:00.000Z	RealOpty	egsome	amd sempron
2010-09-09T03:59:00.000Z	egsome	RealOpty	I think it's `AMD64` processor, Right ?
2010-09-09T04:00:00.000Z	RealOpty	egsome	idk should i do cat /proc/cpuinfo ?
2010-09-09T04:01:00.000Z	RealOpty	egsome	AMD Sempron(tm) Processor LE-125
2010-09-09T04:02:00.000Z	egsome	RealOpty	Maybe not useful, but with fast Googling I found that it is `AMD64` already, So, I think it can do 64bit somehow, see: http://www.amd.com/us/products/technologies/64-bit-computing/Pages/64-bit-computing.aspx
2010-09-09T04:05:00.000Z	RealOpty	egsome	i found this
2010-09-09T04:06:00.000Z	RealOpty	egsome	 does that seem to say that it is a 64bit processor?
2010-09-09T04:06:00.000Z	egsome	RealOpty	`#  64-bit processor  Yes  `, Yeah
2010-09-09T04:06:00.000Z	RealOpty	egsome	indeed.
2010-09-09T04:06:00.000Z	RealOpty	egsome	ty.
2010-09-09T04:07:00.000Z	egsome	RealOpty	Hope you enjoy 64bit computing :)
2010-09-09T04:07:00.000Z	RealOpty	egsome	yeah about that, for some reason ive been using 32bit ubuntu on this machine for years now :\
2010-09-09T04:09:00.000Z	egsome	RealOpty	It's the time to try 64bit of Ubuntu, I've it on my servers, but for desktop still use 32bit, thinking to move soon. ( Intel Core2Quad 2.4 GHz )
2010-09-09T04:12:00.000Z	RealOpty	egsome	yeah ive been using 64bit ubuntu on my core2duo that i use as a build machine
