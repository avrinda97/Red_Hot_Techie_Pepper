2005-08-25T11:56:00.000Z	GoClick		Do you have any other OSes?
2005-08-25T11:57:00.000Z	GoClick		Or some sort of driver from the manufacturer?
2005-08-25T11:57:00.000Z	GoClick		My experiance so far with WiFi under Linux is that it's spotty at best if you don't have drivers directly from the manufacturer
2005-08-25T11:58:00.000Z	GoClick		Can you get an IP from the DHCP server?
2005-08-25T11:59:00.000Z	GoClick		I'm not a grub expert so I won't be able to help with that persay
2005-08-25T11:59:00.000Z	GoClick		I'd probably just install all over
2005-08-25T12:01:00.000Z	GoClick		and it works under Windows right?
2005-08-25T12:01:00.000Z	GoClick		wget isn't exactly a gui kinda thing
2005-08-25T12:01:00.000Z	GoClick		it just for downloading one or two files off http
2005-08-25T12:01:00.000Z	GoClick		Atleast not vanila HTTP
2005-08-25T12:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	GoClick	rubbish - wget -c will resume from a n aborted download
2005-08-29T06:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	GoClick	the server install just installs the base system - no X or gnome
2005-08-29T06:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	GoClick	about 1.8 Gig default: you can make it much smaller by starting with a "server" install, but you need to befamiliar with apt and package names etc
2005-08-29T06:59:00.000Z	GoClick	thoreauputic	well we'd also like x and gnome and synaptic and firefox but that's about it
2005-08-29T07:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	GoClick	with gnome? tight fit I think
2005-08-29T07:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	GoClick	understood
2005-08-29T07:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	GoClick	someone who was logged in probably copy-pasted the URL like that :)
2005-08-29T07:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	GoClick	just add the new user to the same groups
2005-08-29T07:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	GoClick	erm group 0 is root, so no
2005-08-29T07:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	GoClick	type " groups" as th first user
2005-08-29T07:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	GoClick	then note the groups and add the decond user to those
2005-09-21T10:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	GoClick	BTW the default runlevel in debian and ubuntu is 2, not 5 like RH or whatever
