2009-01-20T10:34:00.000Z	cattlesnake		The resources online were fruitless.
2009-01-20T10:34:00.000Z	mindrape	cattlesnake	-whats the issue?
2009-01-20T10:34:00.000Z	cattlesnake	mindrape	I have a Gateway m-1617 laptop and am unable to connect to a Linksys Router.
2009-01-20T10:34:00.000Z	mindrape	cattlesnake	- wired or wireless?
2009-01-20T10:35:00.000Z	cattlesnake	mindrape	- the router is attached to a desktop computer which has a cable modem.
2009-01-20T10:36:00.000Z	cattlesnake	mindrape	- the first.
2009-01-20T10:36:00.000Z	mindrape	cattlesnake	- and you want to connect via ethernet?
2009-01-20T10:36:00.000Z	cattlesnake	mindrape	- no, I want to connect using my laptop via wireless.
2009-01-20T10:36:00.000Z	mindrape	cattlesnake	- okay.            sudo lshw -C network             what kind of card and what driver is it using?
2009-01-20T10:37:00.000Z	cattlesnake	mindrape	- I don't see a wireless network on here.
2009-01-20T10:38:00.000Z	mindrape	cattlesnake	sudo iwconfig
2009-01-20T10:38:00.000Z	mindrape	cattlesnake	on lshw you may have to scroll up through the output... (shift + pgup)
2009-01-20T10:39:00.000Z	cattlesnake	mindrape	- I don't see those either.
2009-01-20T10:39:00.000Z	mindrape	cattlesnake	how about you copy and paste the output to www.pastebin.com so we can see.
2009-01-20T10:40:00.000Z	cattlesnake	mindrape	- I can't because this laptop is not connected to the internet, I am on the desktop.
2009-01-20T10:40:00.000Z	mindrape	cattlesnake	- to make this move smoothly how about you pastebin the following output.         sudo lshw -C network           sudo iwconfig          sudo ifconfig                sudo lspci
