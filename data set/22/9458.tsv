2004-11-01T07:10:00.000Z	bob2	Ubuntu-Linux	please read the FAQ
2004-11-01T07:10:00.000Z	Ubuntu-Linux	bob2	you talking about http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/root
2004-11-01T07:11:00.000Z	bob2	Ubuntu-Linux	yes. and the wiki page.
2004-11-01T07:11:00.000Z	Ubuntu-Linux	bob2	i read it. it doesnt say if it possible to add a normal root user
2004-11-01T07:13:00.000Z	bob2	Ubuntu-Linux	it's very very very clear.
2004-11-01T07:38:00.000Z	bob2	Ubuntu-Linux	it's an important difference, and being rude to people helping you seems counter-productive
2004-11-01T07:41:00.000Z	bob2	Ubuntu-Linux	I'm in the ACT.
2004-11-01T08:05:00.000Z	bob2	Ubuntu-Linux	so use the Cd you downloaded last night.
2004-11-01T08:06:00.000Z	Ubuntu-Linux	bob2	havent you been liston to my problem
2004-11-01T09:57:00.000Z	bob2	Ubuntu-Linux	it would be great if you could state your whole sentence on a single line
2004-11-01T09:58:00.000Z	Ubuntu-Linux	bob2	you try working in a 480x240 rez
2004-11-01T09:58:00.000Z	bob2	Ubuntu-Linux	that's a very odd resolution, VGA is 640x480
2004-11-01T09:59:00.000Z	Ubuntu-Linux	bob2	i know my moniter anyway support 1600x1200@85Hz
2004-11-01T09:59:00.000Z	bob2	Ubuntu-Linux	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingXautoconfiguration
2004-11-01T10:00:00.000Z	Ubuntu-Linux	bob2	i cant use lynx at such a rez.
2004-11-01T10:00:00.000Z	bob2	Ubuntu-Linux	unless something has gone horripbly wrong, you're in a 80x25 terminal, which you certainly can run lynx in.
2004-11-01T10:01:00.000Z	Ubuntu-Linux	bob2	i protest till someone tell me howto change the rez??
