2006-07-30T10:51:00.000Z	tritium	MilesAttacca	?  Just install the ubuntu packages
2006-07-30T10:51:00.000Z	MilesAttacca		Ubuntu packages?
2006-07-30T10:52:00.000Z	tritium		!nvidia > MilesAttacca
2006-07-30T10:52:00.000Z	tritium	MilesAttacca	the nvidia drivers are already packaged for you ;)
2006-07-30T10:53:00.000Z	MilesAttacca	tritium	They are? How should I get to 'em? So far Ubuntu's gotten the wrong drivers or something, the system keeps locking up and I have to restart.
2006-07-30T10:53:00.000Z	MilesAttacca		I also can't just use apt-get for this as the computer in question isn't connected to the Interweb yet.
2006-07-30T10:53:00.000Z	tritium	MilesAttacca	see the URL I had ubotu send you
2006-07-30T10:54:00.000Z	MilesAttacca	tritium	Found that awhile ago.
2006-07-30T10:54:00.000Z	tritium	MilesAttacca	then you should know that there are ubuntu packages
2006-07-30T10:55:00.000Z	MilesAttacca	tritium	Totally misunderstood the nature of Synaptic up until now.
2006-07-30T10:55:00.000Z	tritium	MilesAttacca	ah, okay.
2006-07-30T10:56:00.000Z	MilesAttacca	tritium	The thing is that now it wants to download more repository indexes, and of course, can't./
2006-07-30T10:57:00.000Z	tritium	MilesAttacca	why don't you have internet access on it?  Need any help with that first?
2006-07-30T10:59:00.000Z	MilesAttacca	tritium	I'm on dial-up, and working from the Windows computer right next to it, so I'd rather still be in here in case something goes wrong (since that computer has been freezing up a lot).
2006-07-30T10:59:00.000Z	MilesAttacca	tritium	And since it wants to download those packages, I'm going the long route of downloading the drivers from nVidia's website, now getting binutils, etc.
2006-07-30T11:00:00.000Z	tritium	MilesAttacca	you can just as easily download the .deb packages
2006-07-30T11:01:00.000Z	MilesAttacca	tritium	How should I go about that?
2006-07-30T11:01:00.000Z	tritium	MilesAttacca	packages.ubuntu.com
2006-07-30T11:01:00.000Z	MilesAttacca	tritium	Thanks.
2006-07-30T11:02:00.000Z	tritium	MilesAttacca	you'll have to install those manually with dpkg, or gdebi (gui).  Luckily, you should already have the dependencies installed (only apt handles dependencies, not dpkg or gdebi)
2006-07-30T11:04:00.000Z	MilesAttacca	tritium	Which group should the package be in?
2006-07-30T11:07:00.000Z	MilesAttacca	tritium	Which group should the package be in?
