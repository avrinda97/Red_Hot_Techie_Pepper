2007-05-15T10:47:00.000Z	soundray	vegas003	what's the precise command that's failing?
2007-05-15T10:48:00.000Z	vegas003	soundray	im installing java, i type in "su" as it says then it asks me for my password, i put it in, and it doesnt work
2007-05-15T10:49:00.000Z	soundray	vegas003	you should not use su on ubuntu. Install java from the repositories, then you won't need to.
2007-05-15T10:49:00.000Z	soundray	vegas003	ignore any instructions that tell you to use su. They are not for ubuntu.
2007-05-15T10:49:00.000Z	vegas003	soundray	and how od i do that?
2007-05-15T10:49:00.000Z	soundray	vegas003	look at the private message that ubotu sent, the one about java.
2007-05-15T10:51:00.000Z	soundray	vegas003	don't listen to andreas_' advice, it's well meant, but misguided.
2007-05-15T10:55:00.000Z	vegas003	soundray	you get the message i sent you?
2007-05-15T10:57:00.000Z	vegas003	soundray	i went to that comunity site on java and it didnt help me
2007-05-15T10:59:00.000Z	soundray	vegas003	su is fine, just not on ubuntu.
2007-05-15T11:00:00.000Z	soundray	vegas003	what's the specific point where you have trouble understanding the community page on java?
2007-05-15T11:01:00.000Z	vegas003	soundray	when i try and use the su they tell me it asks for the password, i put it in and it tells me the authentication failed
2007-05-15T11:01:00.000Z	soundray	vegas003	I asked you not to use that site.
2007-05-15T11:02:00.000Z	soundray	vegas003	familiarize yourself with software installation on Ubuntu. Use this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware
2007-05-15T11:03:00.000Z	vegas003	soundray	sorry, musta missed you telling me that, but i go to the community site and i dont know where to start
2007-05-15T11:04:00.000Z	soundray	vegas003	I'll answer in pm
2007-05-15T11:07:00.000Z	soundray	vegas003	got my private messages?
2007-05-15T11:07:00.000Z	vegas003	soundray	no
2007-05-15T11:07:00.000Z	soundray	vegas003	you pm'ed me, I responded to that.
2007-05-15T11:08:00.000Z	vegas003	soundray	i closed that after you told me i shouldnt pm people lol
2007-05-15T11:09:00.000Z	soundray	vegas003	no, I would have been notified if you had. You just have to switch back to it.
2007-05-15T11:10:00.000Z	vegas003	soundray	i right clicked it and went to close
