2008-10-31T14:18:00.000Z	jynxzero_		Hi... has anyone done un upgrade from Heron -> Ibex, on a box with LILO+LVM ?
2008-10-31T14:18:00.000Z	jynxzero_		I'm a bit scared because past kernel upgrades have left my box unbootable.
2008-10-31T14:19:00.000Z	jynxzero_		And I can't use GRUB due to a BIOS bug
2008-10-31T14:19:00.000Z	ikonia	jynxzero_	if the update of lilo works you should have no problems
2008-10-31T14:20:00.000Z	jynxzero_	ikonia	Sadly, that's not my experience.  :(
2008-10-31T14:27:00.000Z	ikonia	jynxzero_	lilo use on ubuntu is rare
2008-10-31T14:28:00.000Z	ikonia	jynxzero_	it is important to understand what is at fault so you don't say "i've got a lilo issue"
2008-10-31T14:28:00.000Z	jynxzero_	ikonia	I don't have a LILO issue.  I've had one in the past.
2008-10-31T14:29:00.000Z	jynxzero_	ikonia	I'm just looking for someone who's tested this and can confirm it worked for them
2008-10-31T14:29:00.000Z	ikonia	jynxzero_	then why mention it in your initial request
2008-10-31T14:29:00.000Z	ikonia	jynxzero_	tested what ?
2008-10-31T14:30:00.000Z	jynxzero_	ikonia	In the past, I had serious issues doing an upgrade, because the packages did not notice that LILO required extra options for the kernel it installed.
2008-10-31T14:30:00.000Z	ikonia	jynxzero_	"I have upgraded and it worked" there you go, I have confirmed it worked
2008-10-31T14:30:00.000Z	jynxzero_	ikonia	From Hardy to Intrepid, on a machine with LILO?
2008-10-31T14:31:00.000Z	ikonia	jynxzero_	one of my test machines is a box with lilo to look at booting from lvm /boot partitions
2008-10-31T14:31:00.000Z	ikonia	jynxzero_	because it worked for me does not mean it will workf or you, I had different hardware in a different configuration
2008-10-31T14:31:00.000Z	ikonia	jynxzero_	no, it updated fine
2008-10-31T14:32:00.000Z	jynxzero_	ikonia	No indeed, I understand this... but if there were several people here who had tried, and it had failed, that would be useful information to me.  Surely you see that? :)
2008-10-31T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	jynxzero_	but as pretty much no-one would be using lilo, I think your not going to get the confidence you want.
2008-10-31T14:33:00.000Z	jynxzero_	ikonia	Fine, sorry for bothering you all.  I'll check how popular my software is before asking next time :P
2008-10-31T14:34:00.000Z	ikonia	jynxzero_	your not bothering anyone, I'm just explaining that pretty much no-one will be using your configurtation, so waiting for multiple people to say "it works" is probably not going to happen
2008-10-31T14:36:00.000Z	jynxzero_	ikonia	Well, I got one already... so it wasn't a totally foolish tactic.  I know it's not a cast iron garuntee but it's better than trying totally blind.
