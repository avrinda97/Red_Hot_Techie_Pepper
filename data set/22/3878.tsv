2008-05-07T15:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Nelson_Apart	/etc/inittab
2008-05-07T15:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Nelson_Apart	or "init $runlevel" to do it dynamic
2008-05-07T15:15:00.000Z	Nelson_Apart	ikonia	i just entered it but no respond
2008-05-07T15:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Nelson_Apart	what did you type ?
2008-05-07T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Nelson_Apart	"sudo init 3"
2008-05-07T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Nelson_Apart	what do you expect it to do ?
2008-05-07T15:17:00.000Z	Nelson_Apart	ikonia	 i expect X would be disabled
2008-05-07T15:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Nelson_Apart	not at run level 3
2008-05-07T15:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Nelson_Apart	X runs at run level 3 on ubuntu
2008-05-07T15:17:00.000Z	Nelson_Apart	ikonia	 :-o
2008-05-07T15:17:00.000Z	Nelson_Apart	ikonia	 so what should the runlevel be
2008-05-07T15:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Nelson_Apart	X is  enabled v by default at run level 2 and on wards
2008-05-07T15:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Nelson_Apart	you have to disable it at the run level you want it to run at
2008-05-07T15:19:00.000Z	Nelson_Apart	ikonia	 so what runlevel should i use if i want X disabled
2008-05-07T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Nelson_Apart	I'll explain it again. X is enabled at run level 2 onwards, so unless you want to use single user mode (run level 1) you'll need to disable/remove X from run level 2 onwards
2008-08-23T21:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Nelson_Apart	ftp daemon
2008-08-23T21:13:00.000Z	Nelson_Apart	ikonia	 it seems that it is for windows, isn't it?
2008-08-23T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Nelson_Apart	no ftp daemons are available for all platforms
2008-08-23T21:16:00.000Z	Nelson_Apart	ikonia	 which FTP Daemon should i use
2008-08-23T21:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Nelson_Apart	I personally think vsftpd is the only one to use
2008-08-23T21:17:00.000Z	Nelson_Apart	ikonia	 let me google a bit on it
