2009-07-19T00:14:00.000Z	themiddleman		I installed a program (numpty physics) from a deb file and I cant uninstall it, sudo aptitude remove -f numptyphysics doesnt uninstall it
2009-07-19T00:15:00.000Z	edbian	themiddleman	What does that command do?
2009-07-19T00:17:00.000Z	edbian	themiddleman	I think you just got the name of the package wrong.
2009-07-19T00:18:00.000Z	themiddleman	edbian	nope, it is correct
2009-07-19T00:19:00.000Z	themiddleman	edbian	 /usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure: numptyphysics is broken or not fully installed
2009-07-19T00:19:00.000Z	edbian	themiddleman	or is it: "sudo apt-get install -f"  I can't remember
2009-07-19T00:19:00.000Z	edbian	themiddleman	try "sudo apt-get install -f"

2009-07-19T00:21:00.000Z	edbian	themiddleman	try installing the app completely: sudo aptitude install numptyphysics
2009-07-19T00:21:00.000Z	edbian	themiddleman	Then remove it
2009-07-19T00:22:00.000Z	edbian	themiddleman	It is odd that there error is that the icon cache file DOES exist
2009-07-19T00:22:00.000Z	themiddleman	edbian	its not in the repo but I will install it
2009-07-19T00:22:00.000Z	edbian	themiddleman	ok
2009-07-19T00:22:00.000Z	edbian	themiddleman	You have a .deb package downloaded?  Is this correct?
2009-07-19T00:23:00.000Z	themiddleman	edbian	yes
2009-07-19T00:23:00.000Z	edbian	themiddleman	Unfortuantely I have to go now :(
2009-07-19T00:24:00.000Z	themiddleman	edbian	thanks for the help
2009-07-19T00:24:00.000Z	edbian	themiddleman	Sorry I couldn't help more! Good luck!  I suspect it's a poorly written package.  After you install and try to remove again I would try deleting that file that is creating the error. The font cache thingy
2009-07-19T00:24:00.000Z	edbian	themiddleman	If it still didn't remove that is.
