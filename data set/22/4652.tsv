2007-12-02T07:08:00.000Z	eltux	kelsin	yeah I have the package on my computer and its going batty when it tries to configure it
2007-12-02T07:04:00.000Z	kelsin	eltux	make sure to clear out your .wine folder also when changing wine versions
2007-12-02T07:04:00.000Z	eltux	kelsin	should I just delete it?
2007-12-02T07:04:00.000Z	kelsin	eltux	if you don't have any programs installed that you NEED to keep in there yes
2007-12-02T07:05:00.000Z	kelsin	eltux	wine has been in beta forever, it hasn't had a "stable" release yet
2007-12-02T07:06:00.000Z	eltux	kelsin	yeah no kiddin. 0.9.50 still has some major problems though. Steam doesn't work right with it yet
2007-12-02T07:06:00.000Z	kelsin	eltux	hence the continuous term of "beta"
2007-12-02T07:07:00.000Z	kelsin	eltux	it's an extremely ambitious program, that also depends on how well written the program you're trying to run is programmed. It's incredible enough as it is, I can run wow and warIII with no issues, I love it :)
2007-12-02T07:07:00.000Z	eltux	kelsin	I just did what you said, and now the program that i choose to install it with (wine doors) is crapping out on me
2007-12-02T07:08:00.000Z	kelsin	eltux	you're installing wine with winedoors?
2007-12-02T07:08:00.000Z	kelsin	eltux	or wine doors is crapping out with the wine from the ubuntu repos?
2007-12-02T07:08:00.000Z	eltux	kelsin	yeah, it was just easier at the time
2007-12-02T07:09:00.000Z	kelsin	eltux	if you're dealing with a wine from winedoors or ANYWHERE other than the ubuntu repos you need to go to them and ask, even if you are it's probably good to ask the wine people
2007-12-02T07:09:00.000Z	eltux	kelsin	it still grabs wine from the ubuntu repos
2007-12-02T07:10:00.000Z	kelsin	eltux	and does other stuff
2007-12-02T07:10:00.000Z	eltux	kelsin	all it does is prompts the install of wine and comes with the configuration tool (wine doors)
2007-12-02T07:10:00.000Z	eltux	kelsin	it just makes it easier to install stuff
2007-12-02T07:10:00.000Z	kelsin	eltux	well passed clearing your home dir I don't have any ideas why you're app isn't working
2007-12-02T07:10:00.000Z	kelsin	eltux	*and by that I mean clearing the .wine folder of course, not your whole home dir
2007-12-02T07:11:00.000Z	eltux	kelsin	well, sudo apt-get remove wine again right? and I'll try deleting .wine again
2007-12-02T07:13:00.000Z	eltux	kelsin	i tried to reinstall steam from my installer and its giving me a wierd cryptic error
2007-12-02T07:14:00.000Z	kelsin	eltux	I already said I don't have any more ideas for you, esp with steam as I have never used it (or ever will)
