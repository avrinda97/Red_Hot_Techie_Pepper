2008-09-24T21:37:00.000Z	jvargas		how do I know which runlevel am I running currently?
2008-09-24T21:38:00.000Z	jrib	jvargas	runlevel
2008-09-24T21:39:00.000Z	jvargas	jrib	thanks
2011-06-21T16:28:00.000Z	jrib	jvargas	sure, just select it at the grub menu
2011-06-21T16:29:00.000Z	jvargas	jrib	I don't have it installed yet, and they doesnt appear on synaptic.
2011-06-21T16:29:00.000Z	jrib	jvargas	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2011-06-21T16:29:00.000Z	jvargas	jrib	11.04
2011-06-21T16:30:00.000Z	jrib	jvargas	and your issue is reproducible on all of the 11.04 kernels?
2011-06-21T16:31:00.000Z	jvargas	jrib	i just have one. 2.6.38, i see no others.
2011-06-21T16:31:00.000Z	jrib	jvargas	do you have a bug report for the issue?
2011-06-21T16:32:00.000Z	jvargas	jrib	yep, I already found some other guys have the same issue. But I just found that it works with older kernels, the one shipped in 10.10
2011-06-21T16:33:00.000Z	jrib	jvargas	can you link to the bug report?
2011-06-21T16:33:00.000Z	jvargas	jrib	sure, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/729171
2011-06-21T16:34:00.000Z	jrib	jvargas	I'd give 2.6.39 a try to see if the issue is resolved (https://launchpad.net/~kernel-ppa/+archive/ppa) rather than revert to the older one.  I'll send you a link on building a kernel package though and then you can build whatever version you'd like :D
2011-06-21T16:35:00.000Z	jvargas	jrib	http://codepad.org/aoCaiK9h
2011-06-21T16:37:00.000Z	jvargas	jrib	i will try right now
2011-06-21T16:41:00.000Z	jvargas	jrib	I tested with a ubuntu server 10.10 cd , and it worked. but do you think this issue is related to kernel or maybe something in ubuntu 11.04 apps?
2011-06-21T16:41:00.000Z	jrib	jvargas	I don't know
2011-06-21T16:43:00.000Z	jvargas	jrib	sorry, didnt received last message
2011-06-21T16:43:00.000Z	jrib	jvargas	I don't know
2011-06-21T16:52:00.000Z	jvargas	jrib	it didn't work. using 2.6.39-0.5 . the error is still present but at least the connection doesn't freeze so fast as with 2.6.38. The max speed rate I get is 250Kbps on a 100Mbps link.
