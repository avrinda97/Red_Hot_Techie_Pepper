2010-03-13T03:30:00.000Z	red		Heya, anyone got tips for this: I made a samba share folder, and added two symlinks there (different folders I want to appear at the share)
2010-03-13T03:30:00.000Z	red		now i can see the share perfectly from another pc, but the added symlink folders dont appear and if i manually type them into adress row it says access denied
2010-03-13T03:30:00.000Z	red		so its there but no rights
2010-03-13T03:31:00.000Z	Sylphid|netbook	red	what are the permissions of the directories you are symlinking to?
2010-03-13T03:32:00.000Z	Sylphid|netbook	red	just making sure i got this right the originals have rw-r--r-- permissions?
2010-03-13T03:33:00.000Z	red	Sylphid|netbook	yeah

2010-03-13T07:24:00.000Z	Sylphid|netbook	red	did you include the username / password options in your mount command
2010-03-13T07:25:00.000Z	red	Sylphid|netbook	mount -t cifs -o username=user,pass=pass //ip/sambashare /mount/point
2010-03-13T07:26:00.000Z	Sylphid|netbook	red	are you using a system user or samba user
2010-03-13T07:26:00.000Z	Sylphid|netbook	red	or guest
2010-03-13T07:27:00.000Z	red	Sylphid|netbook	i've created username for myself and a friend, im able to login to the samba with both of those logins via nautiluus
2010-03-13T07:28:00.000Z	Sylphid|netbook	red	well the mount syntax looks fine
2010-03-13T07:30:00.000Z	Sylphid|netbook	red	just verified that syntax works fine on my samba share
2010-03-13T07:31:00.000Z	Sylphid|netbook	red	did you reload samba after adding the users or changing the share permissions
2010-03-13T07:31:00.000Z	Sylphid|netbook	red	what error does it give you
2010-03-13T07:33:00.000Z	Sylphid|netbook	red	your not trying to mount it inside of the share right? that would be a loop that may cause problems
2010-03-13T07:35:00.000Z	red	Sylphid|netbook	i got it to work now, oddly i had to use //serverip/firstfolder
2010-03-13T07:45:00.000Z	red	Sylphid|netbook	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2188345/samban900.png Behold. I'm sharing samba to my linux mobile phone over 3G (SSH-loopback tunnel) :)
2010-03-13T07:46:00.000Z	Sylphid|netbook	red	nice!
