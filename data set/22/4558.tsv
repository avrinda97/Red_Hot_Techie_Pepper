2007-12-23T22:04:00.000Z	MrPiracy	ikonia	ok, thanks
2007-12-23T22:06:00.000Z	MrPiracy	ikonia	sorry, i'm 200% new to ubuntu, could you also tell me other good programs for torrent and a good audio player (does winamp work with linux?)
2007-12-23T22:07:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPiracy	mplayer, sound juicer, xmms - all audio players, there are many for you to try
2007-12-23T22:07:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPiracy	torrents, Hmmm, rtorrent seems to be a solid tool
2008-02-11T20:18:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPiracy	re-install grub
2008-02-11T20:23:00.000Z	MrPiracy	ikonia	ok, when i type find /boot/grub/stage1 in grub prompt, it says file not found
2008-02-11T20:23:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPiracy	so that file is not found on any of your partitions
2008-02-11T20:24:00.000Z	MrPiracy	ikonia	how can it be? i just ran a terminal and typed cd /boot/grub and all the files were there
2008-02-11T20:24:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPiracy	how are you booting the system if you where just getting a grub prompt
2008-02-11T20:25:00.000Z	MrPiracy	ikonia	i typed the script i have on menu.lst and it worked
2008-02-11T20:25:00.000Z	MrPiracy	ikonia	root(hd0,9) ... kernel /vmlinuz....
2008-02-11T20:25:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPiracy	drop the /boot from the find command your doing
2008-02-11T20:26:00.000Z	MrPiracy	ikonia	same thing
2008-02-11T20:26:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPiracy	your supposed to be doing that in a grub prompt - is that what your doing ?
2008-02-11T20:27:00.000Z	MrPiracy	ikonia	yes, in grub prompt
2008-02-11T20:28:00.000Z	MrPiracy	ikonia	i just tried root(hd0,9) in grub like i did before booting and it says selected disk doesnt exist
2008-02-11T20:28:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPiracy	look at your /boot/grub/device.map
2008-02-11T20:30:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPiracy	you're meant to use uuid to get around that
2008-02-11T21:23:00.000Z	ikonia	MrPiracy	open the theme manager and apply it
2008-02-11T21:24:00.000Z	MrPiracy	ikonia	it doesnt have an apply button
