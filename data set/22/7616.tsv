2006-03-19T09:51:00.000Z	Xenguy	OmegaAlpha	you need to run it tunnelled over SSH
2006-03-19T09:52:00.000Z	Xenguy	OmegaAlpha	just find a HOWTO - you can use SSH tunneling for a lot of things
2006-03-19T09:53:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	Xenguy	yeah thats what someone was telling me
2006-03-19T09:54:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	Xenguy	i was asking the one day about doing networking stuff and thats when someone brought up putty and ssh and tunneling and being able to access my computer from anywhere
2006-03-19T09:55:00.000Z	Xenguy	OmegaAlpha	so you are looking for VNC tunneled over SSH?
2006-03-19T09:55:00.000Z	Xenguy	OmegaAlpha	if yes, use x11vnc
2006-03-19T09:55:00.000Z	Xenguy	OmegaAlpha	a bit of a pain to configure, I thought, but do-able...
2006-03-19T09:56:00.000Z	Xenguy	OmegaAlpha	 I have an article somewhere
2006-03-19T09:56:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	Xenguy	i dont know what that means hehe.. i dont remember what tunneling isi remember it was kinda simple though
2006-03-19T09:57:00.000Z	Xenguy	OmegaAlpha	basically it just means that you can encrypt various services you use over the Net; also you can forward one port to another, to circumvent firewalls, and so on
2006-03-19T10:03:00.000Z	Xenguy	OmegaAlpha	orthogenal
2006-03-19T10:03:00.000Z	Xenguy	OmegaAlpha	er, orthogonal
2006-03-19T10:05:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	Xenguy	 what do you mean orthogonal
2006-03-19T10:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	OmegaAlpha	2 concept categories at right angles; they don't fit on the same level
2006-03-19T10:16:00.000Z	Xenguy	OmegaAlpha	in this case vnc and ssh work together better, not apart :-)
2006-03-19T10:18:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	Xenguy	so i guess that program that integrates the both of them is the way to go.. if i can only find it
2006-03-19T10:19:00.000Z	Xenguy	OmegaAlpha	you need specific software?
2006-03-19T10:19:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	Xenguy	im totally new to using either. so i wouldn tknow where to begin. i did learn how todo the control -alt f# thing and to log in again but i forgot what that new command like is.. a console right? someone was trying to explain everythign to me.. and the differences
2006-03-19T10:19:00.000Z	Xenguy	OmegaAlpha	my gawd, stick with breezy/stable...
2006-03-19T10:20:00.000Z	Xenguy	OmegaAlpha	if there is a specific problem, focus on that
2006-03-19T10:20:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	Xenguy	 this is breezy
2006-03-19T10:20:00.000Z	Xenguy	OmegaAlpha	good
