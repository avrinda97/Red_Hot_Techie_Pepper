2008-04-28T04:28:00.000Z	enaner		I have  a Old DELL INSPIRON 5000, and when i try to install XUBUNTU, it says ... "This kernel requires an x86-64 CPU, but only detectd an i686 CPU. Unable to boot - please use a kernel appropriate for your CPU". What Should I DO?
2008-04-28T04:28:00.000Z	Wyzard	enaner	You're trying to boot the 64-bit installer, which your machine doesn't support
2008-04-28T04:29:00.000Z	Wyzard	enaner	Use the 32-bit ("i386") one
2008-04-28T04:29:00.000Z	enaner	Wyzard	where can i download that version?
2008-04-28T04:29:00.000Z	Wyzard	enaner	same place you got the 64-bit one
2008-04-28T04:29:00.000Z	Wyzard	enaner	http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
2008-04-28T04:31:00.000Z	Wyzard	enaner	The alternate one may not be what you want
2008-04-28T04:32:00.000Z	Wyzard	enaner	That's a plain text-based installer, rather than a liveCD and graphical installer
2008-04-28T04:32:00.000Z	enaner	Wyzard	is there a set of instructions I can follow, or can you help me ... cuz it's 92% done already i would hate to cancel
2008-04-28T04:33:00.000Z	Wyzard	enaner	There's nothing wrong with it (as an advanced user I prefer it, actually) but I don't want you to think that the "alternate" CD is what's needed for a 32-bit machine
2008-04-28T04:33:00.000Z	Wyzard	enaner	You've downloaded 92% of a 700MB file in two minutes?
2008-04-28T04:33:00.000Z	enaner	Wyzard	 is it that much harder?
2008-04-28T04:34:00.000Z	Wyzard	enaner	No, not really...  some people just get intimidated by things that aren't graphical
2008-04-28T04:34:00.000Z	enaner	Wyzard	 no i was already downloading it bcz of the "Alternate" not because of i386... bcz i was having trouble wit ubuntu and regular xubuntu ...
2008-04-28T04:34:00.000Z	Wyzard	enaner	The process is basically the same; it just looks different
2008-04-28T04:34:00.000Z	enaner	Wyzard	 thank you for your help =]
2008-04-28T04:34:00.000Z	Wyzard	enaner	If you're already downloading it, make sure you're not getting the 64-bit alternate CD; you'll have the same problem with that one
2008-04-28T04:35:00.000Z	enaner	Wyzard	 fortunately its i386 =]
2008-04-28T04:47:00.000Z	enaner	Wyzard	 i am now beginning the process
2008-04-28T04:51:00.000Z	enaner	Wyzard	everytime i open"Movie Player" my screen goes dark and everything stops ... what should I do??
2008-04-28T04:52:00.000Z	Wyzard	enaner	No idea about that one, sorry...  maybe someone else can help
2008-04-28T04:53:00.000Z	enaner	Wyzard	so far your suggestion with i386 is working wonderfully :)
