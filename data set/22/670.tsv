2011-05-19T23:00:00.000Z	guedressel		hi there!
2011-05-19T23:00:00.000Z	guedressel		guy - my ubuntu went crazy since i updated to 11.04
2011-05-19T23:01:00.000Z	guedressel		its _always_ swapping
2011-05-19T23:01:00.000Z	guedressel		848/2953mb of memory used - 733mb swap anyway :(
2011-05-19T23:02:00.000Z	guedressel		since my harddisk is not ssd my computer freezes often
2011-05-19T23:02:00.000Z	quiescens	guedressel	and is any of the swap that is being allocated actually being swapped in?
2011-05-19T23:03:00.000Z	guedressel	quiescens	every time when i shut down the screensaver or standby it needs about five minutes to get "usable" again
2011-05-19T23:14:00.000Z	quiescens	guedressel	the idea is usually to page out unused memory to use it for i/o caching
2011-05-19T23:15:00.000Z	quiescens	guedressel	if you want to have a look at processes with a large number of swap-in's, you can try ps -eo pid,maj_flt,cmd
2011-05-19T23:15:00.000Z	guedressel	quiescens	thanks - thats a hint.
2011-05-19T23:17:00.000Z	quiescens	guedressel	maj_flt should tell you how many memory pages a given process has tried to access which have actually required a swap read
2011-05-19T23:18:00.000Z	quiescens	guedressel	if there aren't any processes with a high number for that field then i don't know where else you would want to look
2011-05-19T23:19:00.000Z	guedressel	quiescens	is 77943 high?
2011-05-19T23:20:00.000Z	quiescens	guedressel	yes
2011-05-19T23:20:00.000Z	guedressel	quiescens	wrong. /usr/bin/X is hightes: 181223
2011-05-19T23:21:00.000Z	guedressel	quiescens	maybe Xorg issue (driver or something?)
2011-05-19T23:22:00.000Z	quiescens	guedressel	you will also need to find out how much ram they are using, but if you have free memory they shouldn't be getting swapped out that much
2011-05-19T23:23:00.000Z	quiescens	guedressel	is your standby set to prepare for hibernation?
2011-05-19T23:25:00.000Z	quiescens	guedressel	for the record, both of the numbers are what could be considered "high", my maj_flt for an X process that hasn't been restarted since 2010 is 3770
2011-05-19T23:31:00.000Z	quiescens	guedressel	anyway, you still need to find out whether it is X and firefox themselves that are causing swapins, or if there is something else, maybe temporarily using a lot of ram and pushing them both out of main memory into swap (subsequently requiring them to swap in)
2011-05-19T23:31:00.000Z	quiescens	guedressel	or even if X has the most faults, it could be firefox forcing both of them out of main memory or vice versa
2011-05-19T23:32:00.000Z	quiescens	guedressel	finally, the kernel could just be swapping them out even though it isn't out of memory for bad reasons which might be fixable with various options
