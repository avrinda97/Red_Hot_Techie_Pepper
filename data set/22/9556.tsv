2005-01-14T16:07:00.000Z	Tomcat_		Ubuntu is still not the best server OS imho, but it does work as one. :)
2005-01-14T16:09:00.000Z	Tomcat_		exim4 is *one* mailer daemon... quite good one imho.
2005-01-14T16:09:00.000Z	Tomcat_		But not the best according to most people.
2005-01-14T16:09:00.000Z	Tomcat_		Sure lilubu.
2005-01-14T16:09:00.000Z	bob2	Tomcat_	in what way isn't it?
2005-01-14T16:10:00.000Z	Tomcat_	bob2	Not a server OS?
2005-01-14T16:10:00.000Z	bob2	Tomcat_	yes
2005-01-14T16:11:00.000Z	Tomcat_	bob2	Well the default install (and there's only that) installs an X and many X apps, right? I'm not sure if I want to fill up my HD with that...
2005-01-14T16:11:00.000Z	bob2	Tomcat_	no, you can do a custom install that doesn't install them
2005-05-27T13:17:00.000Z	Tomcat_	bob2	Why not install backports?
2005-05-27T13:18:00.000Z	bob2	Tomcat_	because they're very poorly made
2005-06-16T14:36:00.000Z	bob2	Tomcat_	some people have a genetic propensity to require cvs snapshots of everything
2005-06-16T14:38:00.000Z	Tomcat_	bob2	Yeah, I know a couple of those... but those I know are the ones who can cope with it. :P
2005-06-22T10:54:00.000Z	bob2	Tomcat_	running debian stable?
2005-06-22T10:55:00.000Z	bob2	Tomcat_	with security updates?
2005-06-22T10:55:00.000Z	Tomcat_	bob2	No, testing... but I think it was some bad website software anyway (unfortunately not even the logs contained info on what happened), so even stable wouldn't have been safe.
2005-06-22T10:55:00.000Z	bob2	Tomcat_	ah
2005-06-22T10:56:00.000Z	bob2	Tomcat_	well, cracked php stuff should only let someone get www-data, which doesn't help much
2005-06-22T10:56:00.000Z	Tomcat_	bob2	Exactly, I love Unix security... they were trying to hack the root account when I noticed... and www-run was running some weird software like an FTPd.
2005-06-22T10:58:00.000Z	Tomcat_	bob2	Yeah, I know some people too... I got awstats as well, but only accessible from the Intranet.
2005-06-30T11:04:00.000Z	bob2	Tomcat_	gnome-volume-manager
2005-07-26T11:12:00.000Z	Tomcat_	bob2	Was that last directed to me? :o
