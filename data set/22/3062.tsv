2008-12-18T15:53:00.000Z	psypher246	bushd	no, sometimes sites crash, sometime the same site doesn't
2008-12-18T15:55:00.000Z	bushd	psypher246	That's odd.  Open firefox and addon that script blocking addon - cant remember the name right now.

2008-12-18T16:03:00.000Z	bushd	psypher246	Well, do you allow prerelease or unsupported updates?

2008-12-18T16:07:00.000Z	bushd	psypher246	I see those FF updates
2008-12-18T16:08:00.000Z	bushd	psypher246	I'm installing them myself though you're on a 64bit system so you can't rule out updates causing your issue prior to the new ones.
2008-12-18T16:09:00.000Z	bushd	psypher246	Have you tried searching to find others with the same bug and how it was fixed?
2008-12-18T16:11:00.000Z	bushd	psypher246	In Synaptic Package Manager find firefox and check Mark for Complete Removal, not just uninstall.
2008-12-18T16:12:00.000Z	bushd	psypher246	Did you run firefox -g /usr... and find the log?
2008-12-18T16:12:00.000Z	psypher246	bushd	explain?
2008-12-18T16:13:00.000Z	bushd	psypher246	Try running firefox -g /usr/bin/gdb/crashy
2008-12-18T16:13:00.000Z	bushd	psypher246	When it crashes go open up crashy
2008-12-18T16:13:00.000Z	bushd	psypher246	Thats your debug log
