2007-08-07T07:49:00.000Z	seamus7		Where do I go to change the default music player setting?
2007-08-07T07:50:00.000Z	serenityUK	seamus7	do you mean for a particualr file like mp3?
2007-08-07T07:51:00.000Z	seamus7	serenityUK	I set a keyboard shortcut to open the default music player; it's currently set as Rhythmbox. I want the default to be Amarok so the shortcut opens it.
2007-08-07T07:55:00.000Z	serenityUK	seamus7	there is a bug in gnome which doesn't let you change the default player.  It is fixed in new version for Gutsy Gibbon,  For a work around try opening a terminal and typing   sudo ln -s /usr/bin/amarok /usr/local/bin/rhythmbox
2007-08-07T07:56:00.000Z	seamus7	serenityUK	thanks ... that's what I hoped to find out ... you're brilliant
2007-08-07T07:57:00.000Z	serenityUK	seamus7	let me know if it works i am runny gutsy i cannot try it myself
2007-08-07T07:59:00.000Z	seamus7	serenityUK	do you think that work around will prevent Rhythmbox from opening?
2007-08-07T08:01:00.000Z	serenityUK	seamus7	on mine the rhythmbox is in /usr/bin/rhythmbox i think the link from the menu will still work..
2007-08-07T08:02:00.000Z	serenityUK	seamus7	 you can always type /usr/bin/rhythmbox to launch it explicitly
2007-08-07T08:05:00.000Z	seamus7	serenityUK	it does partially work in that my keyboard shortcuty (actually the Media Direct button on my Dell laptop) does now launch Amarok ... but sadly the media buttons on the front of my laptop (play, stop, forward, back) no longer work as they did with Rhythmbox ... oh well, no biggy, I'll just wait for Gutsy :) ...
2007-08-07T08:05:00.000Z	serenityUK	seamus7	 you could always reverse the first change by   sudo ln -s /usr/bin/rhythmbox /usr/local/bin/rhythmbox
2007-08-07T08:05:00.000Z	seamus7	serenityUK	what would be the terminal text for removing the link I made previously
2007-08-07T08:06:00.000Z	seamus7	serenityUK	:) thx
2007-08-07T08:08:00.000Z	seamus7	serenityUK	sorry ... I'm getting a problem message with the command you gave me to revert back ... it's saying <ln: creating symbolic link `/usr/local/bin/rhythmbox' to `/usr/bin/rhythmbox': File exists>
2007-08-07T08:09:00.000Z	serenityUK	seamus7	 ok lets delete the link  try   sudo rm /usr/local/bin/rythmbox
2007-08-07T08:09:00.000Z	serenityUK	seamus7	 spelling mistake i mean sudo rm /usr/local/bin/rhythmbox
2007-08-07T08:10:00.000Z	seamus7	serenityUK	ok
2007-08-07T08:10:00.000Z	serenityUK	seamus7	it might just go back now without another link?
2007-08-07T08:10:00.000Z	seamus7	serenityUK	that did it yes.. thx.
2007-08-07T08:11:00.000Z	serenityUK	seamus7	ok cool.,.  im running an alpha test of gutsy and we have a multimedia tab to change the option.. only two month away
2007-08-07T08:13:00.000Z	serenityUK	seamus7	 every 6 months.. next is 7.10
2007-08-07T08:15:00.000Z	seamus7	serenityUK	do you think people will be urged to upgrade or like Edgy will folks be told to wait .. I remember being told Edgy was ... well ... edgy ... and that I perhaps should stick with Dapper LTR at the time .... will be Gutsy be ready?
