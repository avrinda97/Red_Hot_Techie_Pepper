2005-08-03T09:19:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	you probably want to change /etc/mplayer.conf; change the vo=x11 to vo=xv
2005-08-03T09:19:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	sorry, it's /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf
2006-05-29T08:06:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	you mean visualboyadvance?
2006-05-29T08:06:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	it's only an apt-get away :)
2006-05-29T08:08:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	on the top menu bar: System-Admin->Synaptic. Once it's open type Ctl-F and search
2006-05-29T08:10:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	have you enabled the multiverse repository?
2006-05-29T08:10:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	and the universe?
2006-05-29T08:12:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	there are several ways, the easiest for me is to ask you to type in a terminal   grep universe /etc/apt/sources.list , does that line have a # at the beginning?
2006-05-29T08:12:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	herm, nm that's gonna be confusing :)
2006-05-29T08:13:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	if you'd put a copy of your /etc/apt/sources.list on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2006-05-29T08:15:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	open /etc/apt/sources.list with the text editor under accessories; open http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ in your browser and cut & paste. Give us the url when you're done
2006-05-29T08:17:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	all the text in the editor into the box
2006-05-29T08:18:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	you don't need to be able to write to it at this point
2006-05-29T08:18:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	see gnomefreak :)
2006-05-29T08:20:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	if everyone pasted stuff for us to see here, no one could read anything
2006-05-31T09:06:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	ask again, we're scrolling fast
2006-05-31T09:07:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	a background for grub you mean?
2006-05-31T09:09:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	ok. To tell you the truth, that is very low on most peoples horizons. Booting only happens about once a week for most ubuntu users, and we only see it for a few seconds. To put it bluntly, we don't really care what the grub boot screen looks like as long as it works
2006-05-31T09:10:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	then maybe you could look it up and write a wiki page ?
2006-05-31T09:11:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	a design decision. Nothing more
2006-05-31T09:17:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	if you have physical access (depending on the router) there should be a recessed button you can press to reset to defaults
2006-05-31T09:18:00.000Z	nickrud	drew	heh.
