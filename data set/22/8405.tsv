2005-09-01T11:02:00.000Z	GregAsche		can someone help me get esd working? i'm so lost
2005-09-01T11:03:00.000Z	persia	GregAsche	What are you trying to do with esd?
2005-09-01T11:03:00.000Z	GregAsche	persia	get it running
2005-09-01T11:04:00.000Z	persia	GregAsche	Locally, or over the network?
2005-09-01T11:04:00.000Z	persia	GregAsche	Do you have ALSA sound working?
2005-09-01T11:05:00.000Z	GregAsche	persia	I think so, but when I search for it in processes, it's not there
2005-09-01T11:05:00.000Z	persia	GregAsche	ALSA doesn't show in a process, but you'd hear sound when you tried to do something noisy.
2005-09-01T11:05:00.000Z	GregAsche	persia	I can't get any sound
2005-09-01T11:07:00.000Z	persia	GregAsche	OK.  For sound problems, you probably want to look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com//DebuggingSoundProblems/.  For the dmix error, I recommend stopping all other sound processes before starting esd.
2005-09-01T11:08:00.000Z	persia	GregAsche	Oops: I take too long to type.
2005-09-01T11:11:00.000Z	persia	GregAsche	I've looked a but for your error, and don't have an easy solution.  My apologies.  It looks like dmix gives this error when the sound device listed as the slave (default output pcm) is already in use.  lsof | grep pcm may provide a guide as to which process is using it.
2005-09-01T11:12:00.000Z	GregAsche	persia	lsof | grep pcm returns nothing
2005-09-01T11:18:00.000Z	GregAsche	persia	back, I didn't get it working though
2005-09-01T11:20:00.000Z	persia	GregAsche	No, the reboot wouldn't work.  There's a thread in the ubuntu forums that suggests changing a couple settings in the config file, but it didn't work for the person reporting the problem there.  As you've maybe not started esd yet this boot, is your sound working again?
2005-09-01T11:20:00.000Z	GregAsche	persia	no
