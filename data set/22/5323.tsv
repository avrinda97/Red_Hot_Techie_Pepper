2007-07-25T11:06:00.000Z	defcon_		Good evening, I have been searching forum after forum for a solution to get WPA enabled in my /etc/network/interfaces file with no luck, I have tried 20+ configurations and the only solution I have found is a gtk application named Rutilt and I want to auto connect on boot not have to open an app
2007-07-25T11:06:00.000Z	defcon_		I have WPA2 AES
2007-07-25T11:06:00.000Z	zanaga	defcon_	is there a reason why not to use network-manager?
2007-07-25T11:06:00.000Z	defcon_	zanaga	YES
2007-07-25T11:07:00.000Z	defcon_	zanaga	it will not list WPA authentication
2007-07-25T11:07:00.000Z	zanaga	defcon_	oh? i use wpa with NM
2007-07-25T11:07:00.000Z	zanaga	defcon_	odd
2007-07-25T11:07:00.000Z	defcon_	zanaga	can I see your configuration?
2007-07-25T11:07:00.000Z	zanaga	defcon_	i'm not at my normal computer at the moment, so sadly i don't have it available
2007-07-25T11:09:00.000Z	zanaga	defcon_	i set up wpa once manually.. lets see if i still remember how it's done =)
2007-07-25T11:12:00.000Z	zanaga	defcon_	the second to last looks like it's the closest to the right solution
2007-07-25T11:12:00.000Z	defcon_	zanaga	I tried that
2007-07-25T11:13:00.000Z	defcon_	zanaga	I have an application that connects me somehow, when I run it from command line it doesnt give me output of what it runs
2007-07-25T11:15:00.000Z	zanaga	defcon_	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31208/ try the last one
2007-07-25T11:15:00.000Z	zanaga	defcon_	it leaves most of it to probe =)
2007-07-25T11:16:00.000Z	defcon_	zanaga	thankyou i will try that
2007-07-25T11:16:00.000Z	zanaga	defcon_	if my memory serves me right, it's pretty close to my config that i used
2007-07-25T11:17:00.000Z	defcon_	zanaga	I use wpa2 aes
2007-07-25T11:18:00.000Z	zanaga	defcon_	it shouldn't matter, that should probe the correct settings
2007-07-25T11:20:00.000Z	defcon_	zanaga	how can I debug what is going wrong?
2007-07-25T11:22:00.000Z	zanaga	defcon_	wpa_supplicant throws quite a bit of information to /var/log/syslog
2007-07-25T11:22:00.000Z	defcon_	zanaga	thankx
