2012-10-27T00:53:00.000Z	BluesKaj	EpsilonRose	what's your password for the wifi interface fo the router in WEP or WPA settings?
2012-10-27T00:57:00.000Z	BluesKaj	EpsilonRose	should be set in network manager if you setup a wifi password depending on whether you used wep or wpa encryption
2012-10-27T01:00:00.000Z	EpsilonRose	BluesKaj	it already is, but when it tries to connect it just cycles the wireless grarphic for a bit and then there's a notification telling me it's disconnected and it asks for the password again.
2012-10-27T01:04:00.000Z	BluesKaj	EpsilonRose	is ndiswrapper necessary , is there no native linux module/driver for that wifi chip ?
2012-10-27T01:05:00.000Z	EpsilonRose	BluesKaj	to my knowlege there are none. All of the guides I saw seemed to require it, but they were also a bit old so that might not be the  case any more. how would I check?
2012-10-27T01:22:00.000Z	EpsilonRose	BluesKaj	I've never tried to use iwconfig before so I don't know if I did it right, but the terminal seems to be hanging on BluesKaj.
2012-10-27T01:27:00.000Z	EpsilonRose	BluesKaj	Now this Netgear Genie thing is poping up, curtasy of wine, and when I click next on it it say my adaptor can't be found.
2012-10-27T01:29:00.000Z	BluesKaj	EpsilonRose	It's been a while since I used ndiswrpper , but I don't recall having to use wine to enable the .inf file .. try sudo modprobe BCM43231
2012-10-27T01:33:00.000Z	EpsilonRose	BluesKaj	technically you don't need wine. I just used it to get the .inf file out of the .exe (rather than installing it on an other computer or find the files online). That command resulted in "FATAL: Module BCM43231 not found."
2012-10-27T01:38:00.000Z	BluesKaj	EpsilonRose	try this command , sudo ifconfig wlan0 up ..pastebin the output pls.
2012-10-27T01:39:00.000Z	BluesKaj	EpsilonRose	if there are no errors ,then run , sudo iwlist wlan0 scan|grep -i essid
2012-10-27T01:39:00.000Z	EpsilonRose	BluesKaj	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1308246/
2012-10-27T01:40:00.000Z	EpsilonRose	BluesKaj	all that gave me was ESSID:"Kalivas"
2012-10-27T01:41:00.000Z	EpsilonRose	BluesKaj	I was under the impression that you got the .inf file into ndiswraper via the -i command.
2012-10-27T01:41:00.000Z	BluesKaj	EpsilonRose	but does it connect ?
2012-10-27T01:43:00.000Z	BluesKaj	EpsilonRose	I assume you follwed a tutorial somewhere similar to this , http://askubuntu.com/questions/48563/could-anyone-help-me-get-my-netgear-wna3100-broadcom-bcm43231-wireless-adapter
2012-10-27T01:46:00.000Z	EpsilonRose	BluesKaj	What do you mean? Should that last command have connected my wireless?
2012-10-27T01:46:00.000Z	EpsilonRose	BluesKaj	It was similar, but there was only one .inf file and it neglected to include the portion with the restart.
2012-10-27T01:49:00.000Z	EpsilonRose	BluesKaj	Right. I'd try the one in the guide you linked me, but their linke seems to be broken.
2012-10-27T01:52:00.000Z	BluesKaj	EpsilonRose	the link in the tutorial is just for the driver which you already have , the tutorial is for installing and enabling the inf file
2012-10-27T01:52:00.000Z	BluesKaj	EpsilonRose	mostly a guide
2012-10-27T01:56:00.000Z	EpsilonRose	BluesKaj	Ok. In that case the only difference was that I use the -i command to install the .inf instead of the gui and I haven't rebooted yet. Would you like me to try that now?
