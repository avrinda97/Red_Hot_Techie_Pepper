2007-04-06T07:32:00.000Z	Andrew250		I guess no one knows
2007-04-06T07:32:00.000Z	Andrew250		and how do I do that?
2007-04-06T07:32:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	what's your problem?
2007-04-06T07:33:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	yes. it's for the format. you always lose 10% of a drive to formatting
2007-04-06T07:34:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	yes. even under ntfs
2007-04-06T07:34:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	take a 2GB drive, format it, and you have 1.8GB available
2007-04-06T07:35:00.000Z	Andrew250	atoponce	I was just using NTFS and it had over 148GBs free
2007-04-06T07:35:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	what is the size of the drive
2007-04-06T07:36:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	150GB?
2007-04-06T07:36:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	ok. so, the capacity is 160GB, and you had 148GB avail in ntfs?
2007-04-06T07:36:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	that sounds about right
2007-04-06T07:36:00.000Z	Andrew250	atoponce	over that
2007-04-06T07:37:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	it's probably the way you partitioned the drive
2007-04-06T07:38:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	and, if it's 160GB, then you won't have more than 150GB avail once you format it
2007-04-06T07:40:00.000Z	Andrew250	atoponce	do you know how I can partition it properly under windows?
2007-04-06T07:40:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	i don't. other than parition magic, which i haven't used in years
2007-04-06T07:41:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	but, you can use gparted to do it fairly easily
2007-04-06T07:43:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	wait, i want to make sure something
2007-04-06T07:43:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	you have a 160GB HDD, and after formatting to ext3, only 148GB is avail?
2007-04-06T07:43:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	or, 136GB is avail? i'm confused
2007-04-06T07:44:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	ok. if it was 148GB, i was going to call it normal behavior.  but 136 does seem a bit aggressive
2007-04-06T07:45:00.000Z	atoponce	Andrew250	i don't blame you
