2005-10-04T12:13:00.000Z	ndlovu		could upgrading libc to the breezy version on a hoary machine cause issues?
2005-10-04T12:13:00.000Z	nalioth	ndlovu	yes. you'll break your hoary
2005-10-04T12:14:00.000Z	ndlovu	nalioth	that serious?
2005-10-04T12:14:00.000Z	nalioth	ndlovu	yes
2005-10-04T12:15:00.000Z	ndlovu	nalioth	I need to upgrade samba and that requires upgrading libc... so you're saying there's no way to upgrade samba without upgrading everything to breezy?
2005-10-04T12:16:00.000Z	nalioth	ndlovu	if you upgrade your libc, you'll be breaking hoary
2005-10-04T12:16:00.000Z	ndlovu	nalioth	so instability, crashes, the end of the world as we know it?
2005-10-04T12:17:00.000Z	nalioth	ndlovu	yes
2005-10-04T12:17:00.000Z	nalioth	ndlovu	and the mother-in-law coming for a visit
2005-10-04T12:17:00.000Z	ndlovu	nalioth	don't want that!
2005-10-04T12:18:00.000Z	ndlovu	nalioth	so breezy it is then.
2005-10-05T15:39:00.000Z	nalioth	ndlovu	ubuntuguide is known to kill systems. you are either lucky or lucky
2005-10-05T15:40:00.000Z	ndlovu	nalioth	I've been pretty lucky so far, I have to say! I really like the step-by-step approach. Especially when I don't have much time to research.
2005-10-05T15:40:00.000Z	nalioth	ndlovu	you'd better start researching
2005-10-05T15:43:00.000Z	ndlovu	nalioth	I wish I had all the time I needed to research, but productivity is unfortunately what I need my comuter for!
2005-10-05T15:44:00.000Z	nalioth	ndlovu	ubuntuguide WILL kill your box if you follow it long enough
2005-10-05T15:47:00.000Z	ndlovu	nalioth	stan|uni: you're saying that as a rule, backports is a _bad_ idea?
2005-10-05T15:48:00.000Z	nalioth	ndlovu	yes, use them warily
2005-10-05T15:49:00.000Z	nalioth	ndlovu	as in "only enable them when you have to have something, and disable them when you get it"
2005-10-05T16:43:00.000Z	nalioth	ndlovu	once you've removed backports from your sources.list, run "apt-get -f install"
2005-10-05T16:46:00.000Z	ndlovu	nalioth	tried apt-get -f install; apt-get update, and still latest version = 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.1...
2005-10-05T16:46:00.000Z	nalioth	ndlovu	apt-get --purge remove your mozilla
