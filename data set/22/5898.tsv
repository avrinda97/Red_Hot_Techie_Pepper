2007-02-02T09:34:00.000Z	virtu	bulmer	not yer, let me install it
2007-02-02T09:34:00.000Z	bulmer	virtu	if you have a working wifi nic, its should already be installed
2007-02-02T09:34:00.000Z	virtu	bulmer	ok.. yes, its already installed
2007-02-02T09:35:00.000Z	bulmer	virtu	see phar0z comments
2007-02-02T09:37:00.000Z	bulmer	virtu	you cant scan wifi with a wire connection.. lolz
2007-02-02T09:37:00.000Z	virtu	bulmer	of course
2007-02-02T09:38:00.000Z	bulmer	virtu	without a wifi nic card, impossible
2007-02-02T09:38:00.000Z	bulmer	virtu	is it in your hand and not plugged-in? hehehe
2007-02-02T09:38:00.000Z	virtu	bulmer	wlan0 here or wmaster
2007-02-02T09:39:00.000Z	bulmer	virtu	we gave you the commands to work with, please scroll up
2007-02-02T09:39:00.000Z	virtu	bulmer	I saw it.. but wich interface?
2007-02-02T09:39:00.000Z	bulmer	virtu	i already told you, try each one, if it gives you error, try the next
2007-02-02T09:40:00.000Z	virtu	bulmer	sure
2007-02-02T09:40:00.000Z	bulmer	virtu	dont be afraid to try each interface, you'll learn from it
2007-02-02T09:41:00.000Z	virtu	bulmer	ok.. tks... iwlist wlan0 scan gaves me no scan results
2007-02-02T09:41:00.000Z	bulmer	virtu	then you maybe in an enclosed can where wifi signals can not get to you..
2007-02-02T09:42:00.000Z	virtu	bulmer	yeah.. i think so too
2007-02-02T09:47:00.000Z	bulmer	virtu	then you maybe in an enclosed can where wifi signals can not get to you.. virtu is in a can...lol
