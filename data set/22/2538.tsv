2009-05-20T21:51:00.000Z	crom09		hello, sometimes (specially when using totem or something graphics-related) my computer starts running very slow.
2009-05-20T21:51:00.000Z	crom09		The system monitor shows 1 cpu goiong 100%
2009-05-20T21:52:00.000Z	crom09		even if i close all programs
2009-05-20T21:52:00.000Z	crom09		and if i look at the processes tab, no app is using the cpu
2009-05-20T21:52:00.000Z	crom09		any help?
2009-05-20T21:53:00.000Z	crom09		any idea of where i can ask help for this?
2009-05-20T21:53:00.000Z	vigo	crom09	What other apps or sustems are running?
2009-05-20T21:54:00.000Z	crom09		nothing, even if I close everything the problem persists and i have to log out
2009-05-20T21:54:00.000Z	vigo	crom09	How many OSs are on that box?
2009-05-20T21:55:00.000Z	crom09	vigo	just ubunto 9.04
2009-05-20T21:55:00.000Z	crom09		new computer
2009-05-20T21:55:00.000Z	crom09	vigo	i suspect it is some problem with the graphic card
2009-05-20T21:55:00.000Z	crom09	vigo	but i don't know what to do
2009-05-20T21:55:00.000Z	vigo	crom09	I am unsure but something sounds really wrong there, is it a laptop?
2009-05-20T21:56:00.000Z	crom09	vigo	desktop
2009-05-20T21:56:00.000Z	crom09	vigo	you know where i could look for help?
2009-05-20T21:56:00.000Z	vigo	crom09	Are all the fans and Heatsinks clean or air out?
2009-05-20T21:57:00.000Z	crom09	vigo	yes + i can see the temperature of the card and it's ok
2009-05-20T21:59:00.000Z	vigo	crom09	You can always look at Launchpad, to see if any others have reported this, that would be the first thing I would check, heatsinks and stuff, maybe is a loose cord /IIDE , or something, but that is just odd for CPU at 100% on a fresh and clean machine.
2009-05-20T21:59:00.000Z	crom09		ok, thx
2009-05-20T22:00:00.000Z	crom09	vigo	the thing is that i can't reproduce it at will, but it has happened several times
2009-05-20T22:01:00.000Z	vigo	crom09	Please remember that 9,04 is still beta, so Launchpad is the place to report such activity and also to find solutions.
