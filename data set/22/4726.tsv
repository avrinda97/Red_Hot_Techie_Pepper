2008-04-23T01:15:00.000Z	Kcaj		How long do I have to wait, on the East Coast of the United States for the new Ubuntu?

2008-04-23T01:16:00.000Z	Kcaj		I finally killed all the server 2k8 enthusiasts, so the choice is between Ubuntu and Ubuntu at the moment because I really don't feel like messing with any other distro
2008-04-23T01:16:00.000Z	Kcaj	hwilde_	Umm, because you can't upgrade between major versions, right?
