2011-02-27T21:35:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	ActionParsnip	UBCD isn't really a solution in this case...
2011-02-27T21:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pragmaticenigma	thought you wanted drive testing..
2011-02-27T21:37:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	ActionParsnip	No, JT13  needs to be able to get the drive formatted, all I was checking for was the device recognized in the system so he could still access it in some fashion
2011-02-27T23:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pragmaticenigma	fedora is the community driven redhat
2012-06-30T02:22:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	ActionParsnip	It's just a user session setting... hardware doesn't matter at this point
2012-06-30T02:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pragmaticenigma	looks like its significant :)
2012-06-30T02:24:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	ActionParsnip	He doesn't need that... A single user account is not showing the preferred resolution, all other user accounts are unaffected
2012-06-30T02:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pragmaticenigma	yes because each user has .nvidiarc  or somesuch in the root of $HOME
2012-06-30T02:26:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	ActionParsnip	I have never heard or seen that file, but he's also trying to solve this via SSH remotely
2012-06-30T02:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pragmaticenigma	you can run X based apps due to X forwarding
2012-06-30T02:27:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	ActionParsnip	that works sort of... part of the problem is without the display variable correctly set it will not know what display is using... if I try to load nvdia settings when Xforward it complains that it can't find the local display
2012-06-30T02:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pragmaticenigma	did you run:  export DISPLAY=0.0
2012-06-30T03:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pragmaticenigma	there are a few around
2012-06-30T03:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pragmaticenigma	or you can call them but only in emergency
2012-06-30T03:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pragmaticenigma	why do you need an op?
2012-06-30T03:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pragmaticenigma	then type:  !ops | NoOova
2012-06-30T03:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pragmaticenigma	that does it you see ;0
2012-06-30T03:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pragmaticenigma	you can tell folks in #ubuntu-ops if you like...
2012-06-30T03:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pragmaticenigma	that too (thanks IdleOne )
2012-06-30T03:52:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	ActionParsnip	Ya just missed him
2012-06-30T03:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pragmaticenigma	oh well :)
