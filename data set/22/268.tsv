2012-09-10T03:44:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	looks like a python 2 vs python 3 error
2012-09-10T03:44:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	have you messed with python / default python?
2012-09-10T03:45:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	so then this is a bug and should be listed as such but in the mean time I have a workaround idea
2012-09-10T03:45:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	I have no idea what thread you're talking about.  You installed python just now?
2012-09-10T03:45:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	Because python is installed by default..
2012-09-10T03:46:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	can you tell me the output of ls -l /usr/bin/python  ??
2012-09-10T03:47:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	The problem is that python 3 is your default (which is weird).  I told you, python is installed by default.  What is confusing you about that.
2012-09-10T03:47:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	no (that is what is strange)
2012-09-10T03:47:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	ahh, I agree. It is strange :P
2012-09-10T03:48:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	Do you know how to fix it?
2012-09-10T03:48:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	sudo apt-get install python2   (should grab some python 2.x)  Are you familiar with python?
2012-09-10T03:49:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	ok.  Yeah, I recognized the syntax change.  Otherwise this would have been a mystery to me!  Anyway, did you install python 2.x  ?
2012-09-10T03:50:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	I 1/2 expect it to freak out.  Since it wanted 3.x for some reason.
2012-09-10T03:51:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	Are you having to change the symlink manually?  (doubly strange)
2012-09-10T03:52:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	ha.  I'm guessing it would have changed the symlink if you had installed python 2.x and then removed 3.x
2012-09-10T03:52:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	what is znc ?
2012-09-10T03:53:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	Now try to purge that package.
2012-09-10T03:53:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	if you manually changed the link that it'll make no diff.
2012-09-10T03:58:00.000Z	Norrin	deadmund	thanks!
2012-09-10T03:58:00.000Z	deadmund	Norrin	awesome :)
