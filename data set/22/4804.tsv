2008-06-07T18:43:00.000Z	Skrux		which is the best, anacron or cron ?
2008-06-07T18:43:00.000Z	Skrux		anacron is based in cron ?
2008-06-07T18:44:00.000Z	hyphenated	Skrux	depends on the problem..
2008-06-07T18:45:00.000Z	hyphenated	Skrux	cron for servers that are always running, anacron for things that don't run all the time (like laptops)
2008-06-07T18:45:00.000Z	Skrux	hyphenated	I want to execute rtorrent from 12 to 3 for example, when the computer is always connected and I need it on shell not X
2008-06-07T18:45:00.000Z	Skrux	hyphenated	perfect
2008-06-07T18:45:00.000Z	Skrux		then: cron
2008-06-07T18:46:00.000Z	hyphenated	Skrux	both anacron and cron suck equally for things that need a GUI (X), they're both really for background tasks that don't involve user input
2008-06-07T18:47:00.000Z	Skrux	hyphenated	but it works with no X programs, And I don't see them working, they are on the background?
2008-06-07T18:48:00.000Z	Skrux		for example: can I tell cron to execute rtorrent or irssi ?
2008-06-07T18:48:00.000Z	hyphenated	Skrux	using screen, probably
2008-06-07T18:49:00.000Z	Skrux	hyphenated	'cos irssi, but If I only want that rtorrent starts downloading without any gui ?
2008-06-07T18:49:00.000Z	Skrux	hyphenated	is it possible without screen ?
2008-06-07T18:50:00.000Z	hyphenated	Skrux	not sure about the specifics of those apps. try writing a script and see if you can make it do what you want. then try to make it work with anacron/cron
2008-06-07T18:50:00.000Z	Skrux	hyphenated	ok
2008-06-07T18:50:00.000Z	Skrux		but it tells me an error
2008-06-07T18:51:00.000Z	Skrux	hyphenated	cron: can't lock /var/run/crond.pid, otherpid may be 5601: Resource temporarily unavailable
2008-06-07T18:51:00.000Z	Skrux		I delete the crond.pid file ?
2008-06-07T18:51:00.000Z	hyphenated	Skrux	no.. what command did you run?
2008-06-07T18:52:00.000Z	Skrux	hyphenated	cron
2008-06-07T18:53:00.000Z	hyphenated	Skrux	uh.. you manage your user's cron jobs using the 'crontab' command
2008-06-07T18:53:00.000Z	Skrux	hyphenated	ok
