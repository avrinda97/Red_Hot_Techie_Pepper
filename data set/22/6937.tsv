2010-03-14T08:24:00.000Z	ddrj		has anyone here installed ubuntu on a system that has NO operating system on it by default?
2010-03-14T08:25:00.000Z	lullabud	ddrj	yeah
2010-03-14T08:25:00.000Z	ddrj	lullabud	did u go the booting ubuntu installer from usb route?
2010-03-14T08:25:00.000Z	lullabud	ddrj	i'm sure many of us have.  it's a pretty common thing.
2010-03-14T08:25:00.000Z	lullabud	ddrj	i've done it from usb and dvd
2010-03-14T08:26:00.000Z	lullabud	ddrj	how did you create your usb disk?
2010-03-14T08:26:00.000Z	lullabud	ddrj	unfortunately, booting usb still has a lot of problems. =/
2010-03-14T08:27:00.000Z	lullabud	ddrj	what machine is it?  you might be able to find people who have done the same thing.
2010-03-14T08:27:00.000Z	lullabud	ddrj	also, it sounds like you may have done the usb creation wrong.  it seems like it's finding a bootable device, but not the bootable partition.
2010-03-14T08:28:00.000Z	ddrj	lullabud	hm.... what do you mean? i dl'ed the ubuntu 9.10 iso, opened up unetbootin, specified iso and then it created it onto my usb drive
2010-03-14T08:29:00.000Z	lullabud	ddrj	oooh, you know, another thing is that not all usb devices are bootable.  some of them have firmware updates available that make them bootable.
2010-03-14T08:30:00.000Z	ddrj	lullabud	is there any alternative other than USB / cd / floppy to installing ubuntu? can i do a network install or anything ?
2010-03-14T08:30:00.000Z	lullabud	ddrj	you could boot over the network, but that's pretty involved.
2010-03-14T08:31:00.000Z	lullabud	ddrj	what kind of usb drive are you trying to boot from?
2010-03-14T08:32:00.000Z	ddrj	lullabud	this is an Ativa 2GB
2010-03-14T08:34:00.000Z	lullabud	ddrj	looks like other people are having boot problems with that flash device...
2010-03-14T08:34:00.000Z	lullabud	ddrj	*usb device
2010-03-14T08:35:00.000Z	lullabud	ddrj	do you have a different usb stick you can use?
2010-03-14T08:35:00.000Z	ddrj	lullabud	woah thanks, how did u know that others were having problems with it? also yeah i can find another usb device, would u recommend any? (i can buy from walmart real quick)
2010-03-14T08:35:00.000Z	lullabud	ddrj	google told me.
2010-03-14T08:36:00.000Z	ddrj	lullabud	can i pm u?
2010-03-14T08:36:00.000Z	lullabud	ddrj	sure
