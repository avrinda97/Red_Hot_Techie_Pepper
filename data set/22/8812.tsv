2005-07-18T09:59:00.000Z	calc	REds	so i'll ask.. what is it?
2005-07-18T10:00:00.000Z	REds	calc	mushoom
2005-07-18T10:00:00.000Z	calc	REds	eh?
2005-07-18T10:02:00.000Z	calc	REds	not speed difference
2005-07-18T10:03:00.000Z	calc	REds	because the boot device needs built in module unless you use an initrd/initramfs
2005-07-18T10:03:00.000Z	calc	REds	most if not all dists use modules
2005-07-18T10:04:00.000Z	calc	REds	but they also setup up initrds
2005-07-18T10:05:00.000Z	REds	calc	i never said dont use modules, just meant slim it down
2005-07-18T10:05:00.000Z	calc	REds	sliming down which modules a dist compiles in is hard to pick since the dist doesn't want to waste ram for other people that don't want those features
2005-07-18T10:05:00.000Z	calc	REds	ck patches help some but hurt in other areas as he mentioned today
2005-07-18T10:06:00.000Z	REds	calc	ofcourse but point is they help, like all patches, its the point
2005-07-18T10:06:00.000Z	calc	REds	also note that if you compile your own kernel you won't get all the other fixes the dist provider has in their kernel
2005-07-18T10:07:00.000Z	calc	REds	2.6 kernels are considered unstable by the upstream authors themselves
2005-07-18T10:07:00.000Z	calc	REds	they recommend you use dist kernels instead
2005-07-18T10:09:00.000Z	REds	calc	REds: 2.6 kernels are considered unstable by the upstream authors themselves ; sorry that was meant for calc
2005-07-18T10:09:00.000Z	calc	REds	actually they aren't what you been reading/smoking? :)
2005-07-18T10:09:00.000Z	calc	REds	iirc upstream kernel.org people recommend using redhat kernels
2005-07-18T10:10:00.000Z	REds	calc	its all based from the same kernel tree, wether its mandrake or redhat u realise
2005-07-18T10:11:00.000Z	calc	REds	thats like saying debian's xfree86 was just like upstreams ;)
2005-07-18T10:11:00.000Z	REds	calc	almost, ;o
2005-07-18T10:11:00.000Z	calc	REds	nope not even close
2005-07-18T10:11:00.000Z	calc	REds	redhat's kernel patch is huge aiui, and so was debian's xfree86 patch (10MB gzip'd)
