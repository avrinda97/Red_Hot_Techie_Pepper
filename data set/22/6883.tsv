2007-02-17T14:04:00.000Z	Quenyar	karthik	- running DSL broadband connection?
2007-02-17T14:04:00.000Z	karthik		ADSL broadband
2007-02-17T14:05:00.000Z	Quenyar	karthik	then get a hub/switch, plug that into ADSL modem, then plug your two computers into hub/switch.  Both will have equal access to the Internet.
2007-02-17T14:06:00.000Z	karthik		i m directly connecting the two computer directky using "crosswire cable"...
2007-02-17T14:07:00.000Z	Quenyar	karthik	- unless you want to firewall your LAN and have your local Ethernet behind that firewall.  In that case, you need to put two ethernet cards in your Linux server and do IP masquerading and firewall - much more to do
2007-02-17T14:07:00.000Z	karthik		i m able to share the internet in windows when both the systems are running in windows
2007-02-17T14:08:00.000Z	karthik		but how to do in ubuntu(server)...
2007-02-17T14:08:00.000Z	karthik		i want the steps
2007-02-17T14:09:00.000Z	karthik		tell me how to do that with firestarter
2007-02-17T14:09:00.000Z	Quenyar	karthik	- If you just want to share the Internet access - equal peers, then all you need is a hub or switch. This is simple hardware.
2007-02-17T14:12:00.000Z	Quenyar	karthik	- if you want to have your server on the Internet and connect one or many other computers behind that, then first you need two ethernet cards in your ubuntu server eth0 and eth1. eth0 connects to the Internet. You then configure IP masquerading and aliasing from eth1 to eth0 so that your windows boxes can send and receive packets through the server to the Internet.
2007-02-17T14:12:00.000Z	karthik		mwe...tell me how to share the internet using firestarter
2007-02-17T14:13:00.000Z	karthik		 IP masquerading.......is it a software?????/
2007-02-17T14:13:00.000Z	karthik		ok mwe
2007-02-17T14:13:00.000Z	karthik		IP masquerading.......is it a software?????/....
2007-02-17T14:14:00.000Z	Quenyar	karthik	- will leave you in mwe's experiened hands....  I'm used to doing it the old fashioned, manual way. If firestarter will just configure this all automagically, then that's going to be simpler to implement (but harder to customize).  Good luck!
2007-02-17T14:15:00.000Z	karthik		Quenyar.....tell me how to configure IP masquerading.....steps in details
2007-02-17T14:15:00.000Z	karthik		Quenyar.....tell me how to configure IP masquerading.....steps in details
2007-02-17T14:17:00.000Z	karthik	Quenyar	said like that
