2011-05-16T16:54:00.000Z	brett__	sahip	not sure the name, but it seems to be called 'Me' or 'About Me'
2011-05-16T16:54:00.000Z	brett__	sahip	it came with the OS
2011-05-16T16:54:00.000Z	brett__	sahip	maybe 'Ubuntu One' is the name?
2011-05-16T16:55:00.000Z	sahip	brett__	well, right click the top bar and say "add to panel", see if it is there
2011-05-16T16:56:00.000Z	brett__	sahip	no, i can't find it
2011-05-16T16:57:00.000Z	sahip	brett__	well. remove all of them and see if it disables
2011-05-16T16:58:00.000Z	brett__	sahip	you mean remove the panel and recreate it?
2011-05-16T16:58:00.000Z	sahip	brett__	no no no. remove all the enabled indicators from that window I linked you to
2011-05-16T16:59:00.000Z	brett__	sahip	i don't see any links that you sent me
2011-05-16T17:01:00.000Z	sahip	brett__	there is a horizontal menu over the top, yes? right click on an empty spot on it and you should get a menu. there, there should be 'add tto panel'
2011-05-16T17:01:00.000Z	brett__	sahip	yes
2011-05-16T17:01:00.000Z	brett__	sahip	i see that
2011-05-16T17:02:00.000Z	sahip	brett__	that should open a window that has things you can enable and disable. right?
2011-05-16T17:03:00.000Z	brett__	sahip	no, i can only add from there
2011-05-16T17:03:00.000Z	sahip	brett__	I am sorry in that case. I must have forgot what it looked like
2011-05-16T17:05:00.000Z	brett__	sahip	so delete the whole panel and recreate?
2011-05-16T17:06:00.000Z	sahip	brett__	ask your question again and someone using gnome can respond
2011-05-16T17:06:00.000Z	brett__	sahip	ok thanks
