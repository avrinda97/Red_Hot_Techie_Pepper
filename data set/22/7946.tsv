2006-06-04T12:34:00.000Z	BenC		BenC: somewhat
2006-06-04T12:34:00.000Z	WebMaven	BenC	I subscribed you to my bug, I hope that's OK.
2006-06-04T12:34:00.000Z	WebMaven	BenC	Networking on my laptop does not work under Dapper (but worked under Breezy) and the machine now freezes when I 'bounce' the interface.
2006-06-04T12:35:00.000Z	BenC	WebMaven	if it's against linux-source-2.6.15 then there's no need to sub me, I already get those :)

2006-06-04T12:38:00.000Z	WebMaven	BenC	I found out after I filed the bug that it's a dupe, but mine has  more confirmation and info.
2006-06-04T12:38:00.000Z	BenC	WebMaven	then dupe the other to yours
2006-06-04T12:39:00.000Z	BenC	WebMaven	oh wait, dupe yours to 34902
2006-06-04T12:39:00.000Z	WebMaven	BenC	at least, that's my estimation, maybe you'll feel otherwise: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/34958
2006-06-04T12:40:00.000Z	BenC	WebMaven	any bugs related to rt2500 are likely SMP issues, and will be fixed soon
2006-06-04T12:42:00.000Z	WebMaven	BenC	I'm not sure it's a ralink issue, the problem also happens when the wired network is bounced, even when the rt2500 module is blacklisted.
2006-06-04T12:42:00.000Z	BenC	WebMaven	ah, hmm
2006-06-04T12:42:00.000Z	WebMaven	BenC	it's all in my bug.
2006-06-04T12:45:00.000Z	BenC	WebMaven	what exactly is the mesg about IRQ conflicts you refered to?
2006-06-04T12:45:00.000Z	BenC	WebMaven	dmesg for dapper would be most appropriate
2006-06-04T12:46:00.000Z	WebMaven	BenC	there is a dmesg for dapper attached.
2006-06-04T12:47:00.000Z	BenC	WebMaven	ok
2006-06-04T12:47:00.000Z	WebMaven	BenC	two in fact
2006-06-04T12:49:00.000Z	WebMaven	BenC	one for my laptop and one from someone else experiencing the same problem on another model with the same chipsets.
2006-06-04T12:53:00.000Z	WebMaven	BenC	I will do any tests and add any data to this bug if it will move the resolution forward.
2006-06-04T12:54:00.000Z	WebMaven	BenC	Just tell me what you need that I haven't provided.
2006-06-04T12:58:00.000Z	WebMaven	BenC	Are you there?
