2012-11-16T02:20:00.000Z	chaingun	Melvin	eth0 not showing up indicates that the proper driver isn't loaded
2012-11-16T02:22:00.000Z	Melvin	chaingun	THATS exactly what i mean! where do i star from! please help!!
2012-11-16T02:23:00.000Z	chaingun	Melvin	Your first step is to find out what the correct driver is. Then determine whether it is available in the standard repositories or not. If it is, you're in luck. Just install from there and you should be good to go. Otherwise, your best bet is to grab the source for the proper driver, and compile/install it yourself.
2012-11-16T02:23:00.000Z	chaingun	Melvin	This is not a simple process if this is your first time messing with this stuff. But you will learn a lot as you work through it.
