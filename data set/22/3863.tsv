2008-10-18T06:25:00.000Z	KingOfDos		dont know from my head, and my desktop is *** at the moment. found a bug in kubuntu 8.10 ;)
2008-10-18T06:26:00.000Z	KingOfDos		but the card/setup is running fine, so that's not a "question" i'd need an awnser for ;)
2008-10-18T06:26:00.000Z	_2	KingOfDos	need hardware info from cli ?   lshw | less
2008-10-18T06:28:00.000Z	KingOfDos	_2	GeForce 8600GT :)
2008-10-18T06:28:00.000Z	_2	KingOfDos	k. i wasn't keeping up with you. just noticed you said you didn't know what card and gui was down.  so i offered a way to find out.
2008-10-18T06:31:00.000Z	_2	KingOfDos	umm that sounds like framebuffer issues.   switching to tty1 puts the card in a different mode (text if not using framebuffering) and for what ever reason xorg isn't doing a clean reset of the gfx card.   don't know why tho.  just the little i have gleened along the way.
2008-10-18T06:31:00.000Z	_2	KingOfDos	short version of that post.  "vidio driver burp"
2008-10-18T06:35:00.000Z	_2	KingOfDos	hard reset.
2008-10-18T06:36:00.000Z	KingOfDos	_2	even when i'd disconnect the DVI cable the screen stays on
2008-10-18T06:37:00.000Z	_2	KingOfDos	very likely.   specally if you were trying to get the highest rez/refresh out of it you could.
2008-10-18T06:39:00.000Z	_2	KingOfDos	i'm just saying i have read the warnings on several things, like svgatextmode for example. that say plainly "experiment at your own risk, setting the rates too high can destroy your hardware!"    just a thought.
2008-10-18T06:40:00.000Z	KingOfDos	_2	the screen is working when i'm using the VGA connection instead of the DVI connection
2008-10-18T06:45:00.000Z	KingOfDos	_2	i'd powered of my computer AND the screen for a while. and now it's working again :)
2008-10-18T06:48:00.000Z	_2	KingOfDos	so a hard reset did the trick ?
2008-10-18T06:48:00.000Z	KingOfDos	_2	i'd did a hard reset of the screen, for about 2 minutes.
2008-10-18T06:49:00.000Z	_2	KingOfDos	yeah. i would probably still disable kernel framebuffering for safty sake on that particular combo.
2008-11-04T15:22:00.000Z	_2	KingOfDos	the command lsb_release just reads /etc/lsb-release   ;/
2008-11-04T15:22:00.000Z	KingOfDos	_2	i know ;)
2008-11-04T15:22:00.000Z	_2	KingOfDos	did you update the database first ?
2008-11-04T15:23:00.000Z	KingOfDos	_2	update the database, like "updatedb"?
2008-11-04T15:24:00.000Z	_2	KingOfDos	no like. sudo apt-get update
2008-11-04T15:24:00.000Z	KingOfDos	_2	ahw, that database. i'd updated that for about 10 times ;)
