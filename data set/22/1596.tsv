2011-08-11T22:56:00.000Z	ironm		hello. what version of ubuntu would you recommend for servers ?
2011-08-11T22:56:00.000Z	theadmin	ironm	Ubuntu Server, naturally.
2011-08-11T22:56:00.000Z	theadmin	ironm	Preferably the LTS release.
2011-08-11T22:56:00.000Z	ironm	theadmin	thanks a lot .. what version is that? .. where can I download it?
2011-08-11T22:57:00.000Z	theadmin	ironm	I can give you a torrent right now, sec.
2011-08-11T22:57:00.000Z	theadmin	ironm	Are you 32-bit or 64-bit?
2011-08-11T22:57:00.000Z	ironm	theadmin	is there no normal download like ftp  or http? .. 64bit
2011-08-11T22:57:00.000Z	theadmin	ironm	Oh, I could give a direct link too
2011-08-11T22:58:00.000Z	theadmin	ironm	http://releases.ubuntu.com/lucid/ubuntu-10.04.3-server-amd64.iso
2011-08-13T16:42:00.000Z	theadmin	ironm	I see
2011-08-13T16:05:00.000Z	theadmin	ironm	It's possible. You can use dd, unetbootin or lili
2011-08-13T16:06:00.000Z	theadmin	ironm	Actually, I'm not sure about dd
2011-08-13T16:06:00.000Z	ironm	theadmin	it didn't work with dd
2011-08-13T16:07:00.000Z	theadmin	ironm	Try unetbootin
2011-08-13T16:08:00.000Z	theadmin	ironm	Works really well with Ubuntu
2011-08-13T16:08:00.000Z	theadmin	ironm	Do so.
2011-08-13T16:37:00.000Z	theadmin	ironm	If you have lots of RAM, you can use VirtualBox to install to a real HD: VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename ~/lol.vdi -rawdisk /dev/sda
2011-08-13T16:39:00.000Z	ironm	theadmin	I have a lot of RAM .. however I run in live mode (and dont't use virtualbox running in live mode)
2011-08-13T16:39:00.000Z	theadmin	ironm	Oh, I see. I meant from within your existing (Debian?) OS
2011-08-13T16:41:00.000Z	ironm	theadmin	the existing debian wheezy or squeeze is always live mode .. I use hard disk / raids only as containers for data
2011-08-13T16:41:00.000Z	theadmin	ironm	Ah... wow. That's quite a mess xD
2011-08-13T16:42:00.000Z	ironm	theadmin	I am changing too often OSes ... *g*
