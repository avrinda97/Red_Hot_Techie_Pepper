2011-04-10T04:04:00.000Z	reut		hello, I need some help with implementing an AVL tree :)
2011-04-10T04:05:00.000Z	reut		twisti you should go to system->monitors and choose the resolution you want
2011-04-10T04:05:00.000Z	[twisti]	reut	in my settings for monitor, i only get resolutions up to 800x600.
2011-04-10T04:05:00.000Z	reut		you should also make sure you have the right driver in use
2011-04-10T04:06:00.000Z	[twisti]		i clearly dont
2011-04-10T04:06:00.000Z	reut		what graphic card?
2011-04-10T04:06:00.000Z	[twisti]		no idea
2011-04-10T04:06:00.000Z	reut		:)
2011-04-10T04:06:00.000Z	[twisti]		whatever virtualbox simulates
2011-04-10T04:07:00.000Z	[twisti]		i get that normal people want the proper drivers and stuff, but i dont care
2011-04-10T04:07:00.000Z	[twisti]		i just want to use a higher resolution

2011-04-10T04:08:00.000Z	[twisti]		oh, so no easy button to press i guess
2011-04-10T04:08:00.000Z	[twisti]		yay.
2011-04-10T04:08:00.000Z	[twisti]		thanks
2011-04-10T04:08:00.000Z	reut		well
2011-04-10T04:08:00.000Z	reut		it's not that hard either, trust me, just go through and if it doesn't work be sure to come back
2011-04-10T04:08:00.000Z	reut		good luck
2011-04-10T04:08:00.000Z	[twisti]		yeah, stuck at step 1
2011-04-10T04:09:00.000Z	[twisti]		installing guest additions does nothing at all
2011-04-10T04:09:00.000Z	[twisti]		i guess thats actually step 3
2011-04-10T04:09:00.000Z	reut	[twisti]	 where is it that you're stuck exactly?
