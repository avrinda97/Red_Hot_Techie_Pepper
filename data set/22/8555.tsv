2005-07-12T07:41:00.000Z	Tsunamii		yeah, but i'm in the root terminal - so no need for sudo command

2005-07-12T07:44:00.000Z	Tsunamii		i'll just change the source.list - i've done it before :P
2005-07-12T07:44:00.000Z	nickrud	Tsunamii	I believe I usually get that 'directory' omitted when a wildcard copy includes a directory, but I didn't tell cp to recurse through directories
2005-07-12T09:26:00.000Z	nickrud	Tsunamii	I tend to use galeon and epiphany as my browsers
2005-07-12T09:27:00.000Z	nickrud	Tsunamii	download only
2005-07-12T10:50:00.000Z	nickrud	Tsunamii	I use muine mostly
2005-07-12T10:51:00.000Z	nickrud	Tsunamii	huh, download :)
2005-07-12T10:51:00.000Z	nickrud	Tsunamii	rhythmbox is on the cd, but you will need gstreamer0.8-mad from universe
2005-07-12T10:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Tsunamii	that gstreamer thing lets rhythmbox play mp3's
2005-07-12T10:52:00.000Z	Tsunamii	nickrud	any other codecs I should download?
2005-07-12T10:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Tsunamii	there are a lot of odd codecs for music, but for mp3's that's all you need
2005-07-12T10:56:00.000Z	nickrud	Tsunamii	mpg123 is a command line mp3 player, I think some people use it to check sound.
2005-07-12T10:57:00.000Z	nickrud	Tsunamii	yeah, mpg123 <mp3>
2005-07-12T10:58:00.000Z	nickrud	Tsunamii	it's also in universe, there are no mp3 players on the cd ;)
