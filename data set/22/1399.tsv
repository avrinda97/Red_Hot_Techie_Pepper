2010-08-13T23:55:00.000Z	econdudeawesome		Howdy! How do I open multiple tabs in a tty shell?
2010-08-13T23:55:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	econdudeawesome	use screen
2010-08-13T23:56:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	well_laid_lawn	what does that mean? I can't--gui is broken, can't fix (that's my next problem to address)
2010-08-13T23:57:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	well_laid_lawn	So I'm giving #lubuntu a try, but I have more of a GNOME questions. What happens if gdm and gnome-desktop-settings "breaks"? As in, won't fully install on an upgrade?
2010-08-13T23:58:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	econdudeawesome	you can to try and remove them then install ubuntu-desktop again
2010-08-13T23:58:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	well_laid_lawn	is there any way to fix the packages? Aptitude, dpkg and apt-get all give me crazy errors
2010-08-13T23:59:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	econdudeawesome	does   sudo apt-get install -f   do anything?
2010-08-14T00:00:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	well_laid_lawn	sudo apt-get install -f <packages> then? Let me give it a shot
2010-08-14T00:00:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	econdudeawesome	try it with no packages first
2010-08-14T00:01:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	well_laid_lawn	will do
2010-08-14T00:01:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	well_laid_lawn	I get a dpkg error status 2
2010-08-14T00:02:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	econdudeawesome	there would have been errors mentioned earlier in the output
2010-08-14T00:03:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	well_laid_lawn	yes
2010-08-14T00:03:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	well_laid_lawn	im in tty shell and pretty unfamiliar with it--not sure how to cut for a pastebin via elinks
2010-08-14T00:04:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	well_laid_lawn	aptitude reports a broken package... how to fix?
2010-08-14T00:05:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	econdudeawesome	the   sudo apt-get install -f   command is supposed to do that
2010-08-14T00:07:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	well_laid_lawn	it wont...
2010-08-14T00:08:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	econdudeawesome	I don't know what to do when that command doesn't work sorry - someone else will
2010-08-14T00:25:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	well_laid_lawn	Finally got it to work. I'm running lubuntu and there was an error in the upgrade of lxdm and lubuntu-default-settings packages. I deleted /etc/alternatives/lxdm.conf and it worked out
2010-08-14T00:26:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	econdudeawesome	well done :] - I would never have known to do that
2010-08-14T00:28:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	well_laid_lawn	luck, my friend, and backing up the file before I removed it
2010-08-14T00:28:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	well_laid_lawn	but now it's in the logs, so hopefully when this error is repeated someone can find it
