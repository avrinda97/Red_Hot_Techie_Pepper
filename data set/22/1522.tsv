2010-04-23T08:49:00.000Z	dotnet41		grub-install ... = grub-setup: error: Cannot read `grub/core.img` correctly - any suggestions?
2010-04-23T08:51:00.000Z	dotnet41		how hard would it be to completely reinstall grub2 from a livecd? (even possible?)
2010-04-23T08:52:00.000Z	charles__	dotnet41	you have to use live cd .... you can not do grub-install while you are using the volume
2010-04-23T08:53:00.000Z	charles__	dotnet41	... do you want the instructions
2010-04-23T08:53:00.000Z	dotnet41		Ive got a few sets - none are working - so sure!
2010-04-23T08:54:00.000Z	dotnet41		Ive been trying to boot back into ubuntu for the last 3 hours.. ;/
2010-04-23T08:55:00.000Z	charles__	dotnet41	... 1. boot from ubuntu 9.10 cd  .... sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt .... where sda5 is your linux partition
2010-04-23T08:56:00.000Z	dotnet41	charles__	Ive got that set up at the moment (was attempting grub-install)
2010-04-23T08:57:00.000Z	charles__	dotnet41	... 2. .... sudo mount --bind /dev  /mnt /dev
2010-04-23T08:58:00.000Z	charles__	dotnet41	... 3. chroot /mnt
2010-04-23T08:58:00.000Z	charles__	dotnet41	... 4. grub-install /dev/sda
2010-04-23T08:59:00.000Z	dotnet41	charles__	thanks a bunch - is that last 'sda' 'sda' or 'sda#' ?
2010-04-23T09:00:00.000Z	charles__	dotnet41	  last is sda .... you want to specify the drive only ... not partition
2010-04-23T09:01:00.000Z	dotnet41	charles__	seemed to work fine - anything important to look at for modification afterwards?
2010-04-23T09:01:00.000Z	charles__	dotnet41	  but you want to be mounted on the partition with ubuntu on it
2010-04-23T09:02:00.000Z	charles__	dotnet41	  yes .... you need to start up in your ubuntu normally and in terminal do .... sudo update-grub
2010-04-23T09:03:00.000Z	dotnet41	charles__	I hope I can make it into ubuntu - doubt grub's going to let me by
2010-04-23T09:04:00.000Z	charles__	dotnet41	 this sets up grub to find all of your operating systems ... such as maybe xp
2010-04-23T09:04:00.000Z	charles__	dotnet41	 if it installed it should start
2010-04-23T09:05:00.000Z	dotnet41		it started me in the grub command line - is there a way to switch to the menu?
2010-04-23T09:08:00.000Z	charles__	dotnet41	 restart and pick safe mode ... 2nd on list ... try to get to terminal
2010-04-23T09:10:00.000Z	dotnet41	charles__	I can't pick anything - after machine bios checks end I'm put immediately in GRUB command line
