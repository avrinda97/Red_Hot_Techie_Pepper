2007-11-17T05:12:00.000Z	blueeyesmike		problem: When I updated the linux-restricted-modules-2.6.22-14-generic encounters a segmentation fault and can't finish installing so every time I install something now I get a message about it. Any way to fix this please?
2007-11-17T05:12:00.000Z	nickrud	blueeyesmike	could you put the output of sudo apt-get -f install on paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-11-17T05:13:00.000Z	blueeyesmike	nickrud	sure 1 second, thanks
2007-11-17T05:15:00.000Z	blueeyesmike	nickrud	it says i'm spamming and i should enable javascript, but it is enabled?
2007-11-17T05:15:00.000Z	nickrud	blueeyesmike	erm, odd. Try pastebin.ca
2007-11-17T05:17:00.000Z	blueeyesmike	nickrud	http://pastebin.ca/777782, that worked thanks
2007-11-17T05:19:00.000Z	nickrud	blueeyesmike	ok, run this line, see what happens: sudo lrm-manager --kver=2.6.22-14-generic
2007-11-17T05:20:00.000Z	blueeyesmike	nickrud	segmentation fault
2007-11-17T05:21:00.000Z	nickrud	blueeyesmike	ok, I worry a bit about this fix, but you could try it: gksudo nano /var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-restricted-modules-2.6.22-14-generic.postinst , add exit 0 to line 2, save, exit, run the install, immediately uninstall, reboot, reinstall
2007-11-17T05:22:00.000Z	nickrud	blueeyesmike	you might run into an issue during the uninstall, that's why I'm uncertain. It would be fixable, however
2007-11-17T05:23:00.000Z	blueeyesmike	nickrud	it installed fine now, so uninstall it?
2007-11-17T05:23:00.000Z	nickrud	blueeyesmike	immediately
2007-11-17T05:24:00.000Z	blueeyesmike	nickrud	--purge autoremove it be fine?
2007-11-17T05:24:00.000Z	nickrud	blueeyesmike	aptitude purge is my preference
2007-11-17T05:25:00.000Z	blueeyesmike	nickrud	when uninstally it removes package linux, will I be able to reboot
2007-11-17T05:25:00.000Z	nickrud	blueeyesmike	linux-image , that package?
2007-11-17T05:25:00.000Z	blueeyesmike	nickrud	no just 'linux' and other restricted modules packages
2007-11-17T05:26:00.000Z	nickrud	blueeyesmike	as long as it doesn't remove linux-image-2.6.22-14-generic, you'll be fine
2007-11-17T05:28:00.000Z	blueeyesmike	nickrud	sorry internet disconnected, i'll be right to reboot?
2007-11-17T05:29:00.000Z	nickrud	blueeyesmike	as long as you didn't uninstall  linux-image-2.6.22-14-generic, you'll be fine
2007-11-17T05:47:00.000Z	blueeyesmike	nickrud	thankyou very much that seems to have done that trick
2007-11-17T05:48:00.000Z	nickrud	blueeyesmike	cool, should have thought of the reinstall earlier.
