2009-05-17T00:15:00.000Z	Classic	fidelitysystem	so go to your windows pc, plug it into your router, wait for it to get internet, then go to control panel > networking (or something) > setup wireless network
2009-05-17T00:16:00.000Z	Classic	fidelitysystem	make sure that your internet cable is plugged into your router, than ethernet cable is plugged into pc and router
