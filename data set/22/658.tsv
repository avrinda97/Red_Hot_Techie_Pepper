2011-07-27T01:33:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Xodiac13	Google a bit for Ubuntu + device name.  There's quite a bit of pages.
2011-07-27T01:33:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Hyperbyte	yeah ive tried almost all of them just wondering which one actually is going to work
2011-07-27T01:35:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Xodiac13	ah... well then it's troubleshooting time.  I suggest you follow a guide that promises to work (like the one I posted) and find out exactly where it goes wrong.  If you have a specific error it'd be a lot easier for people to help you, rather than 'it doesn't work'.
2011-07-27T01:35:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Hyperbyte	okay have you gotten this device to work before
2011-07-27T01:36:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Hyperbyte	the problem i have is when i show it the .inf file it freezes and then i have to reinstall ndiswrapper and hopefully try again
2011-07-27T01:36:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Xodiac13	no.  I think your chances of randomly bumping into someone who has are quite slim.
2011-07-27T01:36:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Hyperbyte	yeah true
2011-07-27T01:37:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Hyperbyte	i think im going to have to wait till drivers come out for it
2011-07-27T01:38:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Xodiac13	well, to be honest, I can't really help you with it, because I know too little about ndiswrapper.  But Google on the problem, and see if you can run ndiswrapper with more debug logging, so you get more details about where exactly it goes wrong.  If it's hangs that's no good, but you need a specific error message for people to help you if it's not a common issue.
2011-07-27T01:39:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Hyperbyte	okay thanks for trying though i appreciate it
2011-07-27T01:39:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Hyperbyte	thats wierd
2011-07-27T01:39:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Hyperbyte	thats i just reinstalled it and it says the hardware is present
2011-07-27T01:40:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Xodiac13	also, try different versions of the .inf file from the driver disk.  32-bit vs 64-bit, Windows 2000 vs Windows XP... that's all I can think of. :)
2011-07-27T01:40:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Xodiac13	ah... well.. that's not weird, that's great. :)
2011-07-27T01:40:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Hyperbyte	but my light on my usb wireless led isnt on
2011-07-27T01:41:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Xodiac13	can't really help you further. :)  You could try addressing the channel with your specific problem, but I'd try a bit more first if I were you.
2011-07-27T01:42:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Hyperbyte	okay can you please point me in the right direction
2011-07-27T01:43:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Xodiac13	sorry, not really.  Maybe you need to enable the adapter somehow, before it works?  Like I said, no experience with ndiswrapper.  Google a bit more maybe, otherwise address the channel.
2011-07-27T01:43:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Hyperbyte	okay thanks again
2011-07-27T01:44:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	Xodiac13	welcome. :)
