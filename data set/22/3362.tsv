2008-09-27T16:41:00.000Z	weird_scientist	airtonix	... thats a start ;) i changed to oss from alsa to see if that worked but to no avail
2008-09-27T16:42:00.000Z	airtonix	weird_scientist	yeah this particular avenue worked for me when trying to get world of warcraft and ventrilo running
2008-09-27T16:42:00.000Z	airtonix	weird_scientist	it also happens to work for other apps too
2008-09-27T16:44:00.000Z	weird_scientist	airtonix	 aoss doesn't work?
2008-09-27T16:44:00.000Z	airtonix	weird_scientist	aoss for me does.
2008-09-27T16:44:00.000Z	weird_scientist	airtonix	how do you use it? $aoss tecnoballz -- ?
2008-09-27T16:45:00.000Z	airtonix	weird_scientist	yeah pretty much : aoss command-to-run
2008-09-27T16:45:00.000Z	weird_scientist	airtonix	The program 'aoss' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
2008-09-27T16:45:00.000Z	airtonix	weird_scientist	you should have a look at the world-of-warcraft page on help.ubuntu.com/community
2008-09-27T16:46:00.000Z	weird_scientist	airtonix	ok is it in a weird repo?
2008-09-27T16:46:00.000Z	airtonix	weird_scientist	maybe...i always enable 'main restricted universe multiverse' repos before i do anything else...force of habit
2008-09-27T16:47:00.000Z	weird_scientist	airtonix	i have those and no dice
2008-09-27T16:47:00.000Z	airtonix	weird_scientist	you can find out which repo a package is in with this : apt-cache show package-name
2008-09-27T16:47:00.000Z	airtonix	weird_scientist	search for aoss at help.ubuntu.com/community
2008-09-27T16:48:00.000Z	weird_scientist	airtonix	i knew that but cheers anyways :)
2008-09-27T16:48:00.000Z	airtonix	weird_scientist	~$ apt-cache search aoss : alsa-oss - ALSA wrapper for OSS applications
2008-09-27T16:48:00.000Z	weird_scientist	airtonix	word
2008-09-27T16:49:00.000Z	airtonix	weird_scientist	but again to see its usage context i suggest the world-of-warcraft page at help.ubuntu.com/community
2008-09-27T16:49:00.000Z	airtonix	weird_scientist	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WorldofWarcraft
2008-09-27T16:51:00.000Z	weird_scientist	airtonix	yeah just looking... i think this is more to allow multiple apps to use sound simultaneously is it not?
2008-09-27T16:51:00.000Z	airtonix	weird_scientist	ja.
