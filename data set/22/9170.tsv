2005-04-26T10:02:00.000Z	Zotnix	jouke	I've gotten it to work.
2005-04-26T10:04:00.000Z	jouke	Zotnix	great, because I didn't. Qemu works fine, it's just the kqemu module I that won't install.
2005-04-26T10:04:00.000Z	Zotnix	jouke	you'll have to uninstall the ubuntu package for qemu and install the CVS version
2005-04-26T10:04:00.000Z	Zotnix		with the kqemu folder inside.
2005-04-26T10:04:00.000Z	Zotnix		It will build the module automatically and install it from there.
2005-04-26T10:04:00.000Z	jouke	Zotnix	I downloaded qemu source and added kqemu source to the directory, did ./configure , make make install and modeprobe kqemu
2005-04-26T10:05:00.000Z	jouke		Ztonix result: module kqemu.o not found
2005-04-26T10:05:00.000Z	Zotnix	jouke	Was it the source of a CVS snapshot?
2005-04-26T10:06:00.000Z	jouke	Zotnix	yes, I usec CVS
2005-04-26T10:07:00.000Z	jouke	Zotnix	used:  cvs -z3 -d:ext:anoncvs@savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/qemu co qemu
2005-04-26T10:08:00.000Z	Zotnix		Did you put the kqemu folder inside qemu
2005-04-26T10:08:00.000Z	Zotnix		?
2005-04-26T10:08:00.000Z	Zotnix		Or dump the source into qemu?
2005-04-26T10:08:00.000Z	Zotnix		So you should have qemu/kqemu
2005-04-26T10:08:00.000Z	jouke		Yes I did
2005-04-26T10:09:00.000Z	jouke	Zotnix	, I have
2005-04-26T10:10:00.000Z	jouke	Zotnix	make also created kqemu.o object files in the different directories with processor names
2005-04-26T10:11:00.000Z	Zotnix		/lib/modules/2.6.10-5-386/misc/kqemu.ko  I have that.
2005-04-26T10:12:00.000Z	jouke	Zotnix	that's the point, I don't get that module file. Somehow, it's not installed
2005-04-26T10:13:00.000Z	jouke	Zotnix	did you edit any of the make files for your installation?
2005-04-26T10:13:00.000Z	Zotnix		no
2005-04-26T10:14:00.000Z	Zotnix	jouke	I got a CVS snapshot. untarred it. Put kqemu folder inside the qemu folder. Did ./configure --prefix=usr
