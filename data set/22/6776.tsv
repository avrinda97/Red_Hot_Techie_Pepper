2006-08-10T09:08:00.000Z	shawnr_		Ok, the only keyboard shortcut of mine that isn't working is "Run a terminal" can anyone help me out?
2006-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	shawnr_	I've got that mapped to my 'menu key' which works fine - what key combo are you trying?
2006-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	shawnr_	Madpilot	ive tried a bunch
2006-08-10T09:10:00.000Z	shawnr_	Madpilot	Super_L (win key), F1, Shift-F1
2006-08-10T09:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	shawnr_	odd, the win keys aren't assigned to anything by default, that should have worked
2006-08-10T09:11:00.000Z	shawnr_	Madpilot	the same keys can be used for other shortcuts like web browser and email
2006-08-10T09:11:00.000Z	shawnr_	Madpilot	just not terminal
2006-08-10T09:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	shawnr_	I know, but by default in Ubuntu Gnome neither Windows key does anythign
2006-08-10T09:12:00.000Z	shawnr_	Madpilot	i have my specific keyboard model selected so even my FN keys are wokring
2006-08-10T09:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	shawnr_	nice - but I'm not sure why Super_L isn't working as assigned.. odd
2006-08-10T09:13:00.000Z	shawnr_	Madpilot	but neither does F1, F2, F3 and so on
2006-08-10T09:14:00.000Z	shawnr_	Madpilot	in other words, if I map the web browser shortcut to SUPER_L, it works... but if I map the terminal shortcut... it doesn't
2006-08-10T09:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	shawnr_	very strange
2006-08-10T09:15:00.000Z	shawnr_	Madpilot	can I edit shortcuts in gconf?
2006-08-10T09:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	shawnr_	yes,
2006-08-10T09:17:00.000Z	shawnr_	Madpilot	i've been looking for it but can't find it
2006-08-10T09:18:00.000Z	Madpilot	shawnr_	start it from terminal w/ gconf-editor, or edit your menus to make it visible - Config Editor is hidden by default in dapper's menus
2006-08-10T09:18:00.000Z	shawnr_	Madpilot	no i know where that it. i mean the keyboard shortcuts in gconf
2006-08-10T09:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	shawnr_	no idea, I tend to avoid gconf... sorry
2006-08-29T10:42:00.000Z	shawnr_	Madpilot	which fs is know for crashing?
2006-08-29T10:42:00.000Z	Madpilot	shawnr_	reiser
2006-08-29T10:43:00.000Z	shawnr_	Madpilot	so you agree that ext3 is good for my backups?
