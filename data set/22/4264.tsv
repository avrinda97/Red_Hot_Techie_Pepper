2008-02-03T22:15:00.000Z	variant_	Zimmer	sorry, had to check the food i'm making :) anyway, when you insert the cd and you choose "safe graphics mode" what is the very next thing that happens?
2008-02-03T22:16:00.000Z	Zimmer	variant_	: nothing
2008-02-03T22:16:00.000Z	variant_	Zimmer	blank screen eh?
2008-02-03T22:16:00.000Z	Zimmer	variant_	: screen blank
2008-02-03T22:16:00.000Z	variant_	Zimmer	is it a laptop? if so what brand and model is it?
2008-02-03T22:17:00.000Z	Zimmer	variant_	: desktop PC - E6600, P5N-E SLI, 8800GTS 640MB
2008-02-03T22:18:00.000Z	Zimmer	variant_	: ?
2008-02-03T22:19:00.000Z	variant_	Zimmer	did you run the disk checker available from the cd menu? it could be that the cd is corrupt. If you run the check and it says everything is fine then you might need to download the "alternative" installer, it runs in text mode and will get the system up and running. a lot of people have the same graphics card so it shouldn't be a problem once you have it installed, the cd can be funny like that sometimes
2008-02-03T22:19:00.000Z	variant_	Zimmer	if the disk checker says there is a problem then you should download a new ubuntu image and burn it again
2008-02-03T22:20:00.000Z	Zimmer	variant_	: I cant even check my disk
2008-02-03T22:20:00.000Z	variant_	Zimmer	/query me if you are still stuck after trying these things
2008-02-03T22:20:00.000Z	variant_	Zimmer	ok, when you insert the cd nothing at all happens?
2008-02-03T22:20:00.000Z	variant_	Zimmer	there is a "check disk for defects" option on that options screen
2008-02-03T22:21:00.000Z	Zimmer	variant_	: I know, I checked it. Nothing showed
2008-02-03T22:21:00.000Z	variant_	Zimmer	nothing showed? you mean it ran but there was no error or what?
2008-02-03T22:21:00.000Z	Zimmer	variant_	: I don't know. Screen goes blank
2008-02-03T22:22:00.000Z	variant_	Zimmer	ok, then it didn't work. i suggest you download the alternate installer and try with that, it's generaly much more reliable in these situations
