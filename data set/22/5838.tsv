2007-02-19T14:49:00.000Z	rbil	rylan	came in late on your conversation. what probs are u having?
2007-02-19T14:50:00.000Z	rylan	rbil	just that my graphics card is not excelerating, my sound card has the temperment of a pms-ing vallygirl, and installing anything seems to cause my computer to spew random ambiguous errors.
2007-02-19T14:53:00.000Z	rbil	rylan	did u originally install dapper and then upgraded it to edgy?
2007-02-19T14:53:00.000Z	rylan	rbil	nope. started fresh with edgy
2007-03-12T11:14:00.000Z	rbil	rylan	just do System ... Administration ... Network Tools ... select Port Scan tab and scan localhost
2007-03-12T11:14:00.000Z	rylan	rbil	that sounds easier.
2007-03-12T11:16:00.000Z	rylan	rbil	round two, since all my open ports are being used. how do i open one?
2007-03-12T11:17:00.000Z	rbil	rylan	ports are opened depending on the services you're running. you can define a particular service to use a particular port other than the default one for that service. so what are u trying to accomplish?
2007-03-12T11:17:00.000Z	rylan	rbil	trying to open a port so that i can run a bittorrent client. so far snails pace downloads
2007-03-12T11:18:00.000Z	rbil	rylan	u using a NAT router? if so, that's where u open the port
2007-03-12T11:18:00.000Z	rylan	rbil	 i am using an unknown chinese router.
2007-03-12T11:19:00.000Z	rbil	rylan	well that is where u do the port forwarding. how? read the manual for your router
2007-03-12T11:19:00.000Z	rylan	rbil	chinese router. chinese manual
2007-03-12T11:20:00.000Z	rbil	rylan	can you login to the router with a web browser and find a menu to do this?
2007-03-12T11:20:00.000Z	rylan	rbil	 chinese router, chinese information from the web browser
2007-03-12T11:20:00.000Z	rylan	rbil	 i dont read chinese
2007-03-12T11:20:00.000Z	rbil	rylan	well I certainly can't help you :-)
2007-03-12T11:25:00.000Z	rbil	rylan	get the administrator of that router to open the port(s) you require
2007-03-12T11:25:00.000Z	rylan	rbil	admin is a moron
2007-03-12T11:26:00.000Z	rbil	rylan	send him over here, I'll straighten him out. I have a couple 2x4's around
2007-03-12T11:26:00.000Z	rylan	rbil	if i wanted to straighten him out all i would have to do is talk really loudly.
2007-03-12T11:27:00.000Z	rylan	rbil	chinese admin = complete wuss
