2006-01-14T13:09:00.000Z	Evodawg		wondering If I should have compiled the mplayer stuff instead of using urpmi
2006-01-14T13:09:00.000Z	Evodawg		man 2006
2006-01-14T13:10:00.000Z	Evodawg		its kinda like cvs
2006-01-14T13:11:00.000Z	Evodawg		urpmi is easier
2006-01-14T13:13:00.000Z	malefestra	Evodawg	- did you install libdvdread3?
2006-01-14T13:15:00.000Z	Evodawg	malefestra	 shows it's already installed
2006-01-14T13:16:00.000Z	malefestra	Evodawg	- interesting... but no sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh?

2006-01-14T13:19:00.000Z	Evodawg	malefestra	 let me go do some rootin around and I'll get back
2006-01-14T13:20:00.000Z	malefestra	Evodawg	- alright, it's kinda weird that you don't have that script
2006-01-14T13:23:00.000Z	Evodawg	malefestra	 I have the file /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3-0.9.4 but no examples/install-css.sh
2006-01-14T13:23:00.000Z	malefestra	Evodawg	- did you get libdvdread3 by sudo apt-get install libdvdread3?  or from elsewhere?
2006-01-14T13:24:00.000Z	Evodawg	malefestra	 got it thru a urpmi source
2006-01-14T13:25:00.000Z	malefestra	Evodawg	- try getting it with apt-get, that might be your problem.
2006-01-14T13:25:00.000Z	Evodawg	malefestra	 I will thanks
2006-01-14T13:38:00.000Z	malefestra	Evodawg	- sudo apt-get work?
2006-01-14T13:39:00.000Z	Evodawg	malefestra	  I dont have apt-get
2006-01-14T14:08:00.000Z	Evodawg	malefestra	 how do I get sudo apt-get or should I use the cvs recommended by mplayer?
