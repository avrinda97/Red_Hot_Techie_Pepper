2006-04-16T10:49:00.000Z	cablop		so he pushed the "del" key
2006-04-16T10:49:00.000Z	cablop		he's the one who bpught the computer
2006-04-16T10:49:00.000Z	cablop		so he wants to have full control on the machine
2006-04-16T10:49:00.000Z	cablop		and i agree, until he crashes alll the things and learns a lot
2006-04-16T10:50:00.000Z	cablop		but i commited an error storaging my files in that computer
2006-04-16T10:50:00.000Z	cablop		hihi its a really good idea
2006-04-16T10:51:00.000Z	cablop		he's not only deleting partitions
2006-04-16T10:51:00.000Z	cablop		he's making magic on a computer
2006-04-16T10:51:00.000Z	cablop		i think a group of hackers sould be interested on looking how he do that things
2006-04-16T10:52:00.000Z	cablop		mounting one partitions two times in the same machine ingnoring what mtab said
2006-04-16T10:52:00.000Z	_jason	cablop	you guys should change the sudo password and type half of the password each.  That way each of you can only sudo when the other is around :)
2006-04-16T11:01:00.000Z	_jason	cablop	just make backups
2006-04-16T11:02:00.000Z	_jason	cablop	heh well use some kind of media that your brother doesn't have access to
2006-04-16T11:03:00.000Z	_jason	cablop	recovering files like that is not 100% reliable, I wouldn't rely on it.  If you want to create partitions formatted as fat32 I think gparted can do it
2006-04-19T15:27:00.000Z	_jason	cablop	ssh
2006-04-19T15:27:00.000Z	_jason	cablop	and putty on the windows machine
2006-04-19T15:28:00.000Z	_jason	cablop	just start a new session and connect to your ip.  You have install the openssh-server on the linux machine?
2006-04-19T15:38:00.000Z	_jason	cablop	can you ssh into it?
2006-04-19T15:44:00.000Z	_jason	cablop	it should be started automatically once you install it
2006-04-19T15:44:00.000Z	_jason	cablop	man update-rc.d
2006-04-19T15:46:00.000Z	_jason	cablop	no, not for ssh
2006-04-19T15:54:00.000Z	_jason	cablop	yes
