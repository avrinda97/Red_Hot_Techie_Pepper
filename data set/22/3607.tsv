2012-05-28T22:31:00.000Z	nibbler_		hi. how would i convert broken utf-8 characters back to proper utf-8? Ã¼ is everywhere wehre a "ü" should be... :/
2012-05-28T22:33:00.000Z	reisio	nibbler_	shouldn't matter
2012-05-28T22:36:00.000Z	nibbler_	reisio	theadmin, does not work: http://nopaste.dk/p5143
2012-05-28T22:36:00.000Z	reisio	nibbler_	-f iso-8859-1
2012-05-28T22:37:00.000Z	nibbler_	reisio	http://nopaste.dk/p5144
2012-05-28T22:38:00.000Z	nibbler_	reisio	theadmin: guess i'll write a script to fix that and learn some about utf-8 meanwhile :/
2012-05-28T22:39:00.000Z	reisio	nibbler_	oh sorry
2012-05-28T22:40:00.000Z	reisio	nibbler_	the char is actually already utf-8
2012-05-28T22:40:00.000Z	reisio	nibbler_	whatever you're viewing it in is interpreting it as iso-8859-1
2012-05-28T22:40:00.000Z	reisio	nibbler_	at least if we can trust nopaste.dk to have not meddled
2012-05-28T22:41:00.000Z	nibbler_	reisio	check http://nopaste.dk/p5146
2012-05-28T22:42:00.000Z	reisio	nibbler_	I'm not really sure 'file' is reliable for such things
2012-05-28T22:42:00.000Z	reisio	nibbler_	isutf8 from moreutils would be, though
2012-05-28T22:42:00.000Z	nibbler_	reisio	it should be, i echoed öäü into that file, and its 7 bytes now. that means its clearly utf-8
2012-05-28T22:43:00.000Z	nibbler_	reisio	i belive i had a utf-8 file, that got interpreted as iso and as such converted to utf8, converting both bytes of the origninal utf-8 to a singular utf-8 character itself
2012-05-28T22:44:00.000Z	nibbler_	reisio	3 ascii character plus the \n should be 4 byte, 3 utf-8 characters, all of them being >128, should be 7byte or more?
2012-05-28T22:45:00.000Z	reisio	nibbler_	isutf8 would make it a certainty, but it doesn't matter really
2012-05-28T22:45:00.000Z	nibbler_	reisio	i belive both the special characters are utf-8 encoded by them self
2012-05-28T22:46:00.000Z	nibbler_	reisio	the file is 5 byte in size, so i'd assume its 2 utf characters
2012-05-28T22:46:00.000Z	nibbler_	reisio	i reduced it to only the 2 broken chars
2012-05-28T22:46:00.000Z	reisio	nibbler_	you think it was converted twice
2012-05-28T22:47:00.000Z	nibbler_	reisio	yep, converting it the other way works ;-)
