2008-12-13T07:58:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	As in /dev/sde1?  I wasn't too descriptive I noticed, I did fsck /dev/sde1 and it said zero-length drive or something
2008-12-13T08:00:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	Ok, I'll reboot.  The drive isn't mounted now, or so says gparted, but I'll reboot just to be safe, if need be
2008-12-13T08:00:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	that isn't destructive is it?
2008-12-13T08:03:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	Mind if I ask what it's doing?  e2fsck is a specific ext2 thing right?  So I guess I heard right when I heard ext3 was ext2+, but what does the -p do?
2008-12-13T08:05:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	I'm trying now, I'll report back.
2008-12-13T08:11:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	It gave me a bunch of results, ata9.00 UNC errors, and the last line was "Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read while trying to open /dev/sde1  Could this be a zero-length partition?"
2008-12-13T08:13:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	What do you mean?  Yes, gparted showed a partition, and said it was there, not sure exactly what it said the problem was.  I'll do sudo fdisk -l.
2008-12-13T08:14:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	ext3
2008-12-13T08:15:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	Not that I saw, it just gave me a bunch of those ata9.00's and the Attempt to read...  at the end
2008-12-13T08:16:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	I saw a few posts online about putting in a "superblock" thing, I just thought that was drive-dependent, so I wasn't sure where to figure out where to put mine
2008-12-13T08:17:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	Just fsck, not e2fsck?
2008-12-13T08:18:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	I did "sudo fsck /dev/sde1" and it called e2fsck, and did the same thing
2008-12-13T08:22:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	I have spinrite, butI know some people don't like it, should I try it anyways?
2008-12-13T08:22:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	What will hdparm give me?
2008-12-13T08:24:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	I just get the same ata9.00 and buffer i/o errors
2008-12-13T08:26:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	Is that a safe block size or whatever?  It's a 320gig drive, formats to 298 and change
2008-12-13T08:27:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	But can I damage it if I put the wrong one in?
2008-12-13T08:30:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	your hdparm one
2009-07-23T04:21:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	"ping google.com"
2009-07-23T04:21:00.000Z	bobbob1016	DasEi	Without quotes
