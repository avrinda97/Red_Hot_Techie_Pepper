2006-06-23T09:24:00.000Z	bruenig	viper	I used automatix myself but I cant recommend that else I will get shouted down
2006-06-23T09:24:00.000Z	viper	bruenig	i'll just follow this ... http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/12/04/libdvdcss2-and-w32codecs-for-ubuntu/
2006-06-23T09:31:00.000Z	bruenig	viper	I dont think easyubuntu has w32codecs
2006-06-23T09:32:00.000Z	bruenig	viper	where do you live, hopefully it's not America because in that case w32codecs can't be installed
2006-06-23T09:32:00.000Z	viper	bruenig	stop scaring me =P
2006-06-23T09:32:00.000Z	bruenig	viper	it's illegal
2006-06-23T09:33:00.000Z	viper	bruenig	fine, report me.
2006-06-23T09:33:00.000Z	bruenig	viper	you wouldn't want to do that if it were illegal
2006-06-23T09:34:00.000Z	bruenig	viper	it seriously is illegal but I don't think many care about that
2006-06-23T09:34:00.000Z	viper	bruenig	you keep track of these things?
2006-06-23T09:34:00.000Z	viper	bruenig	i'm curious about your position on bt
2006-06-23T09:35:00.000Z	bruenig	viper	by bt you mean bittorrent?
2006-06-23T09:36:00.000Z	bruenig	viper	I was just joking about you not doing it
2007-03-12T08:13:00.000Z	bruenig	viper	question...
2007-03-12T08:14:00.000Z	bruenig	viper	in gnome, good luck if you can figure that out
2007-03-12T08:14:00.000Z	bruenig	viper	I can't imagine being able to do that
2007-03-12T08:16:00.000Z	bruenig	viper	your setup that you want is not very common, you are the only one in fact that I have ever seen wanting something like that. It is not a priority then to add that functionality. Usually if someone wants more functionality, they go to the command line, not to the gui.
2007-03-12T08:22:00.000Z	bruenig	viper	gnome is awful for that, it is not meant for that kind of configuration. If you want that go to kde.
2007-03-12T08:25:00.000Z	bruenig	viper	you can fresh install kubuntu, or you can do sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop and then just pick which one you want to boot into at login
