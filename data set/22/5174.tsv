2007-07-04T13:50:00.000Z	quinton_	hende	sorry, I am a little new to linux myself... I only know some basics
2007-07-04T13:50:00.000Z	quinton_	hende	I will try to help my best though
2007-07-04T13:51:00.000Z	quinton_	hende	it might, but then again linux does not support as much as windows does... Its very different and runs off programs of its own making...
2007-07-04T13:52:00.000Z	quinton_	hende	If it does not work you may want to ask someone of a higher knowledge.
2007-07-04T13:52:00.000Z	quinton_	hende	Sorry I couldnt be of much help though.
