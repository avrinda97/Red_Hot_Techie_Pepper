2012-07-20T04:09:00.000Z	dcullen		Man, I thought that would bring on tons of jokes
2012-07-20T04:10:00.000Z	L3top	dcullen	pm? is off topic
2012-07-20T04:47:00.000Z	L3top	dcullen	May I pm for an off topic question?
2012-07-20T04:47:00.000Z	dcullen	L3top	I don't PM. If it's worth asking, it's worth sharing
2012-07-20T04:48:00.000Z	L3top	dcullen	Not allowed in channel. Concerning your mint/pxe drones. Not a worry.
2012-07-20T04:48:00.000Z	dcullen	L3top	OK, PM me
2012-07-20T04:49:00.000Z	dcullen	L3top	jeepers, I forget how to PM
2012-07-20T05:56:00.000Z	dcullen	L3top	has he tried the "nv" driver?
2012-07-20T05:57:00.000Z	L3top	dcullen	I am pretty sure nv is gone. nouveau or proprietary nvidia are all that remain
2012-07-20T17:51:00.000Z	dcullen	L3top	Yes, technically, there is a chance ripthejacker's script could cause a problem. But I am counting on him not writing any infinite loops
2012-07-20T17:54:00.000Z	dcullen	L3top	if ripthejacker can dig through the files in /etc/init and figure out how to write an upstart script, he can always do that
2012-07-20T17:56:00.000Z	L3top	dcullen	place script in /etc/init.d   update-rc.d myscript defaults   will add it to the runlevels and order it based on the script name. To remove update-rc.d -lf myscript remove
2012-07-20T17:57:00.000Z	dcullen	L3top	Wait, what? The order is based on script name?
2012-07-20T17:58:00.000Z	L3top	dcullen	eg s90astart will run before s90dostart and based on prerequisite loads will wait or run.
2012-07-20T18:00:00.000Z	dcullen	L3top	that line is in /lib/init/upstart-job and I'm trying to learn it (but it's an ugly system)
2012-07-20T18:03:00.000Z	dcullen	L3top	ripthejacker, you can specify prerequisites in your script using the "Required-Start" line
2012-07-20T18:39:00.000Z	dcullen	L3top	no problem. it was only a virtual bus, and i'm only in a virtual hospital, i should be out in virtually no time
2012-07-20T18:50:00.000Z	dcullen	L3top	dhanasekaran, that is another option: mount the ISO and edit the /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-07-20T19:57:00.000Z	dcullen	L3top	Can Pulse be removed without plain-person having to select an action to handle broken dependencies?
2012-07-20T22:54:00.000Z	L3top	dcullen	nilfs... sort of.  Subversion + WebDAV... sort of.
2012-07-20T22:59:00.000Z	dcullen	L3top	nilfs? Does that stand for the NULL file system?
2012-07-20T23:01:00.000Z	dcullen	L3top	oh, good. I was studying Object C recently, and they use "nil" for "NULL", so i got a little nervous
