2007-02-21T06:07:00.000Z	leleobhz		 files list file for package `libfreetype6' contains empty filename <<< this is during a dpkg -r. Someone know why?
2007-02-21T06:08:00.000Z	Ferret	leleobhz	That just means someone's stuck a carriage return at the end of the list, or something
2007-02-21T06:08:00.000Z	leleobhz	Ferret	in what file?
2007-02-21T06:09:00.000Z	Ferret	leleobhz	the list of files which that package installed when you first installed it... dunno quite where that is actually, I'll check
2007-02-21T06:11:00.000Z	leleobhz	Ferret	check plz and thanks!
2007-02-21T06:13:00.000Z	Ferret	leleobhz	This stuff is so badly documented. :D
2007-02-21T06:14:00.000Z	leleobhz	Ferret	im trying to install it again forced
2007-02-21T06:14:00.000Z	Ferret	leleobhz	Please try 'dpkg-query -L packagename' to see if you get the same error
2007-02-21T06:15:00.000Z	leleobhz	Ferret	same error
2007-02-21T06:18:00.000Z	Ferret	leleobhz	I straced it, the file you're looking for is /var/lib/dpkg/info/libfreetype6.list
2007-02-21T06:18:00.000Z	leleobhz	Ferret	well. but how can i extract it from the package?
2007-02-21T06:19:00.000Z	Ferret	leleobhz	you want the list of files from the .deb? o.o
2007-02-21T06:19:00.000Z	leleobhz	Ferret	i have the .deb file here
2007-02-21T06:20:00.000Z	Ferret	leleobhz	The error you're having is probably caused by a blank line or similar in that file.  Mine looks like this: http://ferret.xelam.net/hosted/libfreetype6.list
2007-02-21T06:20:00.000Z	Ferret	leleobhz	dpkg-deb --contents file.deb
2007-02-21T06:20:00.000Z	Ferret	leleobhz	I really have no idea what you're doing now. n.n
2007-02-21T06:21:00.000Z	Ferret	leleobhz	Why are you doing a force install anyhow?
2007-02-21T06:21:00.000Z	leleobhz	Ferret	see what is into my .list:
2007-02-21T06:22:00.000Z	leleobhz	Ferret	http://pastebin.com/885780
2007-02-21T06:23:00.000Z	leleobhz	Ferret	anyway, changing the file content, it give-me the error
