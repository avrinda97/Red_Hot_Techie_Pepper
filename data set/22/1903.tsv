2010-06-17T13:21:00.000Z	kurtis	jigal	Looks like you need to install a Java Runtime and possibly create a /bin/java alias as well
2010-06-17T13:22:00.000Z	jigal	kurtis	but i think that i did something wrong with the paths or so
2010-06-17T13:22:00.000Z	kurtis	jigal	Yeah I would think Java would be found in /usr/bin or anyonewhere but /bin/
2010-06-17T13:23:00.000Z	kurtis	jigal	You can try closing and opening your terminal window unless you've modified your .bashrc (or other shell configuraiton) file
2010-06-17T13:25:00.000Z	jigal	kurtis	still the same error
2010-06-17T13:26:00.000Z	kurtis	jigal	can you run "whereis java" for me?
2010-06-17T13:27:00.000Z	jigal	kurtis	java: /usr/bin/java /etc/java /usr/lib/java /usr/share/java /usr/share/man/man1/java.1.gz
2010-06-17T13:28:00.000Z	kurtis	jigal	Are you running a script that is executing those commands you posted?
2010-06-17T13:28:00.000Z	jigal	kurtis	what do you mean
2010-06-17T13:29:00.000Z	kurtis	jigal	Are you manually typing in /usr/bin ....., or are you running some kind of program or script that is trying to start a java program?
2010-06-17T13:30:00.000Z	jigal	kurtis	no i am running a .sh script
2010-06-17T13:30:00.000Z	kurtis	jigal	Okay I have 2 options for you. First, you can cahnge the script to replace /bin/java with /usr/bin/java or you can make a link
2010-06-17T13:30:00.000Z	kurtis	jigal	I would recommend modifying the script, personally
2010-06-17T13:31:00.000Z	jigal	kurtis	i think the problem appeared after i set the JAVA_HOME and the $PATH i think something is wrong over there
2010-06-17T13:31:00.000Z	kurtis	jigal	oh are you trying to install a java web server or something?
2010-06-17T13:32:00.000Z	jigal	kurtis	i am trying to install cruisecontroll and phpUnit
2010-06-17T13:34:00.000Z	kurtis	jigal	You could possibly try 'sudo ln -s /usr/bin/java /bin/java' and then just make sure you remove the /bin/java file when you're done
2010-06-17T13:36:00.000Z	kurtis	jigal	If you messed up your paths, you should fix them. Or at least bring them back to a "default" state.
2010-06-17T13:36:00.000Z	jigal	kurtis	well messing up is easy but fixig ;-
2010-06-17T13:37:00.000Z	kurtis	jigal	breaking and fixing is how you learn
2010-06-17T13:39:00.000Z	kurtis	jigal	Let me know if that symbolic link works out for you
