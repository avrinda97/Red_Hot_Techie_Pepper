2011-09-24T15:31:00.000Z	RoDiMuS-X		Yeah I wrote it
2011-09-24T15:32:00.000Z	RoDiMuS-X		I am using it
2011-09-24T15:32:00.000Z	RoDiMuS-X		I have been since May
2011-09-24T15:32:00.000Z	RoDiMuS-X		There are some bugs
2011-09-24T15:32:00.000Z	RoDiMuS-X		If you are comfortable with restoring, then I don't recommend
2011-09-24T15:33:00.000Z	RoDiMuS-X		11.10 is running on Gnome 3
2011-09-24T15:34:00.000Z	RoDiMuS-X		If your like me, and dislike Unity then no problems
2011-09-24T15:34:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]	RoDiMuS-X	I thought that's Unity BASED on Gnome 3.
2011-09-24T15:34:00.000Z	RoDiMuS-X		This is correct
2011-09-24T15:34:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]	RoDiMuS-X	Woah woah woah, why the hate?
2011-09-24T15:34:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]		o_O
2011-09-24T15:34:00.000Z	RoDiMuS-X		No hate I dislike
2011-09-24T15:35:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]		It's like the sexiest change I've seen in Ubuntu.
2011-09-24T15:35:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]	RoDiMuS-X	Well I mean to say, why the dislike. xD
2011-09-24T15:35:00.000Z	RoDiMuS-X	Ubuntusawr[xD]	 it does not function in an efficient manner for how I do things.
2011-09-24T15:36:00.000Z	RoDiMuS-X	Ubuntusawr[xD]	I like to customize, I like how Gnome-Shell has extensions that can be written using JavaScript
2011-09-24T15:37:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]	RoDiMuS-X	As in what terms? is it slow? o_O    In my experience, Unity performed better for me than Gnome 2 (metacity), sometimes, metacity would "bloat" in memory size from time to time. Oftenly, near 100MBs, and ont time, it has gotten to like 400MB of ram :S
2011-09-24T15:37:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]	RoDiMuS-X	Ah, I se. Awesome.
2011-09-24T15:37:00.000Z	RoDiMuS-X	Ubuntusawr[xD]	Not speed, Tweakiness :D
2011-09-24T15:38:00.000Z	RoDiMuS-X	Ubuntusawr[xD]	I will admit the lens feature is pretty cool but I like having no dock and Unity docks to the left
2011-09-24T15:39:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]	RoDiMuS-X	But it at least autohides. But I see your point.
2011-09-24T15:39:00.000Z	RoDiMuS-X	Ubuntusawr[xD]	Thats the awesome thing about Linux, so many choices, So I never say I hate something because I know people put in hard work to create
