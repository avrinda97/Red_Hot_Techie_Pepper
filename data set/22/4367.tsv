2008-09-24T14:57:00.000Z	ja1		Question: Is sharing the same swap partition for different OS's bad? I only run one OS at a time. [Slackware, Gentoo, kubuntu]
2008-09-24T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	thats fine, you will only have 1 OS booted and it makes managemnt easier
2008-09-24T14:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	id save it was a great idea
2008-09-24T15:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	ext3
2008-09-24T15:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	ext2 for flash drives or ntfs f its going to go into windows machines
2008-09-24T15:07:00.000Z	ja1	ActionParsnip	Ok, thanks for explaining the reason.
2008-09-24T15:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	ext3 has a journal which you dont need on flash storage as it takes up 10% space
2008-09-24T15:09:00.000Z	ja1	ActionParsnip	Maybe I should go for ext2 on my HD aswell, as Im short of storage space (too much data?) :)
2008-09-24T15:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	what size is it?
2008-09-24T15:12:00.000Z	ja1	ActionParsnip	This partition for kubunto will be 9.7 Gb. All other partitions (about the same size) are ext2
2008-09-24T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	9.7Gb is plenty for a kubuntu install
2008-09-24T15:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	if you want to switch to ext2 to gain 900Mb you can use sudo tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/<partition name>
2008-09-24T15:14:00.000Z	ja1	ActionParsnip	I hope to sqeeze in a few programs and some data too... I test ext3 and tune2fs. Thanks alot.
2008-09-24T15:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	i always set it for security but you will hardly really use it
2008-09-24T15:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	as you can sudo when you need power
2008-09-24T15:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	sudo passwd
2008-09-24T15:58:00.000Z	ja1	ActionParsnip	I find myself in need of power all the time and have to sudo a lot, which is tedious...
2008-09-24T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	its more secure to sudo
2008-09-24T16:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	use sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
2008-09-24T16:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	get updated and see how you go from there
2008-09-24T16:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	you may also want to run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-09-25T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ja1	its the same
