2012-10-19T10:30:00.000Z	xflr6		Hi everybody, I have a problem for formatting a HDD of 2To. Whereas gparted always manage to create a GPT and to make an ext4 partition, it is never recognized at the end, nor by gparted, nor by anything else that I tried up to date
2012-10-19T10:31:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	xflr6	when you say 'at the end' what do you mean
2012-10-19T10:33:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	xflr6	could you try partitioning with gdisk and see if the outcome is similar? :v
2012-10-19T10:34:00.000Z	xflr6	D3RGPS31	Well, I tried to look at it, but... where can I find help to use gdisk ?
2012-10-19T10:35:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	xflr6	it's not in the default install/livecd :v have to install it ($ apt-get install gdisk) :v then just $ man gdisk
2012-10-19T10:51:00.000Z	xflr6	D3RGPS31	I jusr tried to use gdisk
2012-10-19T10:51:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	xflr6	results not showing up?
2012-10-19T10:52:00.000Z	xflr6	D3RGPS31	I managed to create a linux fs (whole disk) with a gpt
2012-10-19T10:52:00.000Z	xflr6	D3RGPS31	but parted -l tells me that disk signature / label (french used is label)  is not recognized
2012-10-19T10:53:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	xflr6	are you required to use parted when selecting an install partition?
2012-10-19T10:53:00.000Z	xflr6	D3RGPS31	no, I make parted -l just to print the tables
2012-10-19T10:54:00.000Z	xflr6	D3RGPS31	and the partition is for storage only
2012-10-19T10:54:00.000Z	xflr6	D3RGPS31	not for an install
2012-10-19T10:54:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	xflr6	does '$ gdisk /dev/sdX -l' show anything
2012-10-19T10:55:00.000Z	xflr6	D3RGPS31	Yes, he does: "Caution: invalid main GPT header, but valid backup: regenrating main header from backup"
2012-10-19T10:56:00.000Z	xflr6	D3RGPS31	which is JUST THE FIRST line ... There are also stuffs like "Caution: after loading partition, the CRC doesnt check out"
2012-10-19T10:57:00.000Z	xflr6	D3RGPS31	and also "Warning! main and backup partiotion tables differ"
2012-10-19T10:57:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	xflr6	:L idk what else to do
2012-10-19T10:57:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	xflr6	does the disk support SMART monitoring?
2012-10-19T10:59:00.000Z	xflr6	D3RGPS31	I guess it should (it a recent one), but standard disk utility of ubuntu (the stuff taht does th gparted job on ubuntu) says that it's not
2012-10-19T11:01:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	xflr6	i don't know what else to do v: could try asking in ##linux
2012-10-19T11:01:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	xflr6	good luck; hope it isn't something bad
