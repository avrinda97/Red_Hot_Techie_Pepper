2006-01-17T10:19:00.000Z	tolstoy	RickKnight	It works!!!!!
2006-01-17T10:20:00.000Z	RickKnight	tolstoy	What works!
2006-01-17T10:20:00.000Z	tolstoy	RickKnight	driver 0.19
2006-01-17T10:22:00.000Z	tolstoy	RickKnight	nope. the ipw2200-0.19.  It doesn't require the separate ieee80211 build.
2006-01-17T10:24:00.000Z	tolstoy	RickKnight	the ipw2200 0.19 driver is what ships with hoary.
2006-01-17T10:24:00.000Z	RickKnight	tolstoy	where does the ipw2200-0.1.9 come from.
2006-01-17T10:24:00.000Z	tolstoy	RickKnight	under downloads at ipw2200.sf.net, choose the [more]  link.
2006-01-17T10:24:00.000Z	RickKnight	tolstoy	I downloaded the 2.4 firmware and now I have an interface.
2006-01-17T10:25:00.000Z	RickKnight	tolstoy	So 0.1.9 is old. It will build on 2.6?
2006-01-17T10:25:00.000Z	tolstoy	RickKnight	yeap.
2006-01-17T10:26:00.000Z	RickKnight	tolstoy	does it do encryption? WPA?
2006-01-17T10:26:00.000Z	tolstoy	RickKnight	it'll complain about a dupe function, I think, but you just comment out the offending code.
2006-01-17T10:26:00.000Z	tolstoy	RickKnight	but if you can confirm, that's at least something.
2006-01-17T10:28:00.000Z	tolstoy	RickKnight	the driver (0.19) seems to require ieee80211_crypt, so, praps.
2006-01-17T10:28:00.000Z	RickKnight	tolstoy	Yes, it is something. I'll do it tomorrow. When I installed the 2.4 firmware and things worked as far as an interface, I thought I had it solved. Now I just can't get the IP address. Something to do tomorrow.
2006-01-17T10:28:00.000Z	tolstoy	RickKnight	just letting you know so you can start bright and early, then, if it works, have an EXCELLENT rest of the day.
2006-01-17T10:29:00.000Z	RickKnight	tolstoy	ieee80211_crypt is one of the extra kernel things kubuntu adds.
2006-01-17T10:30:00.000Z	RickKnight	tolstoy	Well, that really is it for me. Tomorrow get here too fast. night all.
2006-01-17T10:30:00.000Z	tolstoy	RickKnight	I removed ieee802* stuff and ipw2200* stuff before installing 0.19.  It works. ;)
2006-01-17T11:28:00.000Z	RickKnight	tolstoy	You here?
2006-01-17T14:16:00.000Z	RickKnight	tolstoy	are you here?
2006-01-18T11:26:00.000Z	RickKnight	tolstoy	Are you around?
