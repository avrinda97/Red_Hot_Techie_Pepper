2004-11-17T13:27:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath		how can I get rid of evolution-data-server-1.0 when gnome starts ? I don't need it at all
2004-11-17T13:28:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath		is it the only way ?
2004-11-17T13:28:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath		well
2004-11-17T13:29:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath		I'll trow evolution away then
2004-11-17T13:29:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath		I don't use evolution
2004-11-17T13:30:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath		this sucks
2004-11-17T13:30:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath		dependecies telle me that if I uninstall this, it'll uninstall lot of other stuff
2004-11-17T13:30:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath		dependencies should really be reworked
2004-11-17T13:31:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath		damn shit, I'm stuck with keeping this stuff that I don't need
2004-11-17T13:32:00.000Z	brainchill	Kal_Zakath	I don't mean to be an idiot but if you want to psychotweak something why are you no using slackware or something
2004-11-17T13:33:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath	brainchill	: I'm a debian user
2004-11-17T13:33:00.000Z	brainchill		it's more psycho friendly .... I installed ubuntu on this computer (my wife's) because a computer idiot can use it
2004-11-17T13:34:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath		but I like the ubuntu's Philosophy and want to support them
2004-11-17T13:34:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath		so I use it
2004-11-17T13:34:00.000Z	brainchill		everything just works (except of course for java but we can fix that)
2004-11-17T13:34:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath		but stuff like this makes me a little nostalgic about debian
2004-11-17T13:35:00.000Z	brainchill		you can support them with cash and still use something else :-)
2004-11-17T13:35:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath		lol nano
2004-11-17T13:35:00.000Z	brainchill		this distro is an amazing desktop wonder though
2004-11-17T13:35:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath	brainchill	: well, I have no cash :)
2004-11-17T13:35:00.000Z	brainchill		I've been really impressed
2004-11-17T13:35:00.000Z	Kal_Zakath	brainchill	: I'm workless since yesterday :/
