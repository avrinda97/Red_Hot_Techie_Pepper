2009-10-29T05:31:00.000Z	losha	DeoFavente1	depends. Where *is* your important data if it's not in /home ?
2009-10-29T05:33:00.000Z	DeoFavente1	losha	Apache operates in /var/www my debian repository operates in /srv/something and I also have mysql and a fps game server which operates in /var/www/somefolder
2009-10-29T05:35:00.000Z	DeoFavente1	losha	how hard do yoou think it would be for me to move my servers to a new partition? My LAMP server is the only one that would be a problem
2009-10-29T05:37:00.000Z	losha	DeoFavente1	in theory, you can move them, and just leave a link behind. In practice, some apps are sensitive about running via links because it can be a security issue. You could just make backups of /var/www and /srv, or  maybe move them to their own partitions...
2009-10-29T05:38:00.000Z	DeoFavente1	losha	ok thanks, ill have to try that someday but that's going to be after I distro upgrade
2009-10-29T05:38:00.000Z	losha	DeoFavente1	backup, backup and backup...
2009-10-29T06:06:00.000Z	losha	DeoFavente1	see above re: InternetConnectionSharing
2009-10-29T06:07:00.000Z	DeoFavente1	losha	Iv'e tried firestarter, but It only did the mini-network part - the desktop can't access the big network or the internet
2009-10-29T06:07:00.000Z	DeoFavente1	losha	I have a bunch of servers on my laptop and the desktop can access those
2009-10-29T06:08:00.000Z	losha	DeoFavente1	dunno, never had to do it myself. What about the other link?
2009-10-29T06:09:00.000Z	DeoFavente1	losha	My latop does have two nics, btw
2009-10-29T06:09:00.000Z	DeoFavente1	losha	Ok, ill try the optables
2009-10-29T06:09:00.000Z	DeoFavente1	losha	iptables
2009-10-29T06:10:00.000Z	losha	DeoFavente1	yeah, Personally, I'd try making the router work...
2009-10-29T06:10:00.000Z	DeoFavente1	losha	router on my computer?
2009-10-29T06:11:00.000Z	losha	DeoFavente1	I thought you said you have a wired/wireless router? That's what they're for...
2009-10-29T06:11:00.000Z	DeoFavente1	losha	Yea but my desktop is at the other end of my house and wiring would be hard
2009-10-29T06:11:00.000Z	DeoFavente1	losha	and wireless nic cards cost money
2009-10-29T06:12:00.000Z	losha	DeoFavente1	well, so does your time...
2009-10-29T06:12:00.000Z	DeoFavente1	losha	true but I was hoping it would cost less. also if I got a wireless nic for my desktop it'd probably need drivers
2009-10-29T06:13:00.000Z	losha	DeoFavente1	entirely up to you, Dude...
2009-10-29T06:13:00.000Z	DeoFavente1	losha	I'll try spending time first then
