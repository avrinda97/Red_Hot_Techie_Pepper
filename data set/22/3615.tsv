2008-11-02T03:36:00.000Z	Jammet		Hello there.
2008-11-02T03:37:00.000Z	Jammet		I'm trying to install the latest Opera, but since the upgrade to Inteprid, the Update manager doesn't seem process the Opera repo any longer. It was unmarked, but I re-enabled it after upgrading.
2008-11-02T03:37:00.000Z	Jammet		Can somebody help me there?
2008-11-02T03:38:00.000Z	emorris	Jammet	did you try a sudo apt-get update        first?
2008-11-02T03:38:00.000Z	Jammet	emorris	No, if that is not done automatically, no. I simply launched the Synaptic Package manager and the normal Ubuntu Add/Remove application and pressed the 'reload' button after re-enabling the Opera repo.
2008-11-02T03:39:00.000Z	emorris	Jammet	that should have done it. are you sure you changed 'hardy' to 'intrepid' on the apt line if applicable?
2008-11-02T03:40:00.000Z	Jammet	emorris	The Opera repo has no descriptor for that, it just says "stable" on it. On the Opera website when I try to manually download the binary for Inteprid, it says that the respective download is compatible to both Hardy and Inteprid, so maybe they left it at that.
2008-11-02T03:41:00.000Z	emorris	Jammet	ok, so what actually happens when you try and install opera?
2008-11-02T03:41:00.000Z	Jammet	emorris	"http://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free" is in the Third party software sources list here.
2008-11-02T03:42:00.000Z	Jammet	emorris	It will get installed, but it's not really the latest version. It's 9.61 instead of 9.62.
2008-11-02T03:43:00.000Z	Jammet	emorris	Meaning, it's not really looking for/or finding the latest version in that repo.
2008-11-02T03:43:00.000Z	emorris	Jammet	oh, i see, give me a sec, i'll try it
2008-11-02T03:43:00.000Z	Jammet	emorris	And there is another thing I was wondering about. Why can I only find Opera in the Synaptic Package Manager and not in the App/Remove app under "Third party" or Canon?
2008-11-02T03:43:00.000Z	Jammet	emorris	Ok.
2008-11-02T03:45:00.000Z	emorris	Jammet	because stuff has to manually be put in add/remove programs IIRC
2008-11-02T03:46:00.000Z	Jammet	emorris	Alright. Are you able to install 9.62 through the Opera repo? If you are, something's wrong with what I did.
2008-11-02T03:47:00.000Z	emorris	Jammet	9.61 is the latest version on that repo
2008-11-02T03:48:00.000Z	Jammet	emorris	So someone at Opera is just being slow? That's a relief.
2008-11-02T03:48:00.000Z	Jammet	emorris	Thank you =)
2008-11-02T03:48:00.000Z	emorris	Jammet	you can get this information (your version and the latest version) from apt-cache policy opera
2008-11-02T03:49:00.000Z	Jammet	emorris	I see. Well, maybe I'll nudge them a little, then. :)
2008-11-02T03:49:00.000Z	emorris	Jammet	hehe
