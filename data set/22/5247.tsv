2008-02-09T10:43:00.000Z	Genius16	pajamian	what did i break?
2008-02-09T10:44:00.000Z	pajamian	Genius16	nothing, tab key nick completion struck me, I said Genetics when I meant Genius16
2008-02-09T10:48:00.000Z	pajamian	Genius16	bobbyd: there is a network manager similar to the one in windows that I believe will graphically find and mount both samba and nfs partitions.
2008-02-09T11:37:00.000Z	pajamian	Genius16	LoL
2008-02-09T11:37:00.000Z	Genius16	pajamian	can you tell i just reinstalled windows yesterday?
2008-02-09T11:37:00.000Z	Genius16	pajamian	or the day before. i dunno. my mom had spyware so i had to make a house call.
2008-02-09T11:37:00.000Z	pajamian	Genius16	I haven't installed windoze in ages, stopped using it quite a while ago.
2008-02-09T11:38:00.000Z	pajamian	Genius16	and you couldn't talk her into trying ubuntu?
2008-02-09T11:38:00.000Z	Genius16	pajamian	here here... word. and stuff.
2008-02-09T11:38:00.000Z	Genius16	pajamian	i didnt even try. i just said if her husband goes lookin for porn again im stealing her laptop
2008-02-09T11:39:00.000Z	Genius16	pajamian	she's actually pretty good. she's never herself contracted spyware, just when her husband gets on her computer. i wont touch his computer... im afraid it will infect me.
2008-02-09T11:39:00.000Z	pajamian	Genius16	I usually ask them what they do with thier computer and tell them if it can/can't be done in ubuntu, then I offer to install it for them and configure it, etc and tell them if it doesn't work out they can always switch back to windoze.
2008-02-09T11:40:00.000Z	pajamian	Genius16	so far I haven't had to switch anyone back to windoze yet.
2008-02-09T11:40:00.000Z	Genius16	pajamian	yeah preaching to the choir
2008-02-09T11:40:00.000Z	Genius16	pajamian	i got my friend of years and years, hardcore windows dude (even liked microsoft) to finally dual boot.
2008-02-09T11:41:00.000Z	pajamian	Genius16	yeah, I know, just saying how I approach people to switch them over.  I will always wait until a re-install is needed as I figure that's the best time to get them to agree to try it.
2008-02-09T11:41:00.000Z	Genius16	pajamian	the best part about telling them what you can/cant do in *nix is you dont have to say "no" much.
2008-02-09T11:43:00.000Z	pajamian	Genius16	yep, I haven't yet.  Last one was using skype and didn't tell me when I initially asked her what she does with it.  It was good though because skype runs on Linux, but she was a bit disappointed that it didn't have webcam support yet, but she is fine with waiting for skype to add it to the linux version.
2008-02-09T11:50:00.000Z	Genius16	pajamian	he is running 6.06
