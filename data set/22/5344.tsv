2008-12-26T10:30:00.000Z	revilodraw		i have some files in my trash can which wont delete, they have a padlock symbol on them, any ideas?
2008-12-26T10:30:00.000Z	ziroday	revilodraw	open up nautilus as root and then remove them
2008-12-26T10:31:00.000Z	revilodraw	ziroday	ok, alt f2, gksudo nautilus, password, then how do i open the trash as root?
2009-03-11T12:22:00.000Z	ziroday	revilodraw	: tried disabling previewing? How large is this folder you are trying to view?
2009-03-11T12:23:00.000Z	revilodraw	ziroday	 hi! it is not just folders, but files and programs too.... when they are *finally* open they run fine... glx gears reports a 2600fps, music and video play smoothly when they are finally open..
2009-03-11T12:23:00.000Z	ziroday	revilodraw	so you're saying there is a lag in opening a new window?
2009-03-11T12:24:00.000Z	ziroday	revilodraw	right, have you just enabled compiz/desktop effects?
2009-03-11T12:25:00.000Z	revilodraw	ziroday	compiz has been working beautifully for ages, and i tried turning it off to see if it had suddenly become a problem but that made no difference
2009-03-11T12:26:00.000Z	ziroday	revilodraw	try opening running gedit in the terminal, are there any helpful errors printed?
2009-03-11T12:28:00.000Z	revilodraw	ziroday	no error messages, it just took about 30 seconds for gedit to open
2009-03-11T12:31:00.000Z	ziroday	revilodraw	I have no idea, sorry. Does it happen on a new user?
2009-03-11T12:32:00.000Z	revilodraw	ziroday	excellent idea, ill try that
2009-03-11T12:36:00.000Z	revilodraw	ziroday	a new user is even slower!
2009-03-11T12:36:00.000Z	ziroday	revilodraw	ouch, I dunno sorry. Sounds like a mess
2009-06-11T13:00:00.000Z	ziroday	revilodraw	you would need to use gparted (partition editor) one the livecd as you can't have that HD mounted when you do the operation. Note there is the possibility of dataloss
2009-06-11T13:01:00.000Z	revilodraw	ziroday	 ok thank you. how high is the possibility of data loss?
2009-06-11T13:01:00.000Z	ziroday	revilodraw	low, but enough to make sure you should backup beforehand :)
2009-06-11T13:02:00.000Z	ziroday	revilodraw	are you taking space away from it it?
2009-06-11T13:03:00.000Z	revilodraw	ziroday	 ill be taking from ubuntu and giving to xp.. a reverse robin hood lol
2009-06-11T13:03:00.000Z	ziroday	revilodraw	then there is a very slim chance
2009-06-11T13:03:00.000Z	revilodraw	ziroday	ok, well here goes. thank you for your help :)
2009-06-11T13:04:00.000Z	ziroday	revilodraw	good luck!
