2005-04-05T11:47:00.000Z	kkathman		does anyone know what the default name and password is for a standard Windows XP machine is? Samba keeps asking me for a name and pass and Its not responding to what I give it for my user login
2005-04-05T11:48:00.000Z	kkathman		command line browser?
2005-04-05T11:48:00.000Z	kkathman		do you mean  something you can use in a desktop/windows area?
2005-04-05T11:49:00.000Z	InitMass	kkathman	like lynx, links, elinks ...
2005-04-05T11:49:00.000Z	kkathman	InitMass	 are those like xterm?
2005-04-05T11:50:00.000Z	InitMass	kkathman	no
2005-04-05T11:50:00.000Z	InitMass	kkathman	but you use them i e g xterm
2005-04-05T11:55:00.000Z	kkathman	InitMass	Can you please explain these other programs such as lynx? Im trying to learn about these things :)
2005-04-05T12:02:00.000Z	InitMass	kkathman	like firefox but you use a terminal
2005-04-05T12:05:00.000Z	kkathman	InitMass	Ahh ok, thanks for that.  Do you know of other things besides xterm?
2005-04-05T12:09:00.000Z	InitMass	kkathman	i know alot of things. anything special you are thinking about?
2005-04-05T12:11:00.000Z	kkathman	InitMass	Im sorry I wasnt specific. I am using XFCE and what comes standard there is Xterm, and Its interface is very inflexible. I like what I had under Gnome, but XFCE is much better for me because of some minimal equipment I have.
2005-04-05T12:13:00.000Z	InitMass	kkathman	do you want another xterm-like terminal?
2005-04-05T12:13:00.000Z	kkathman	InitMass	Yes that would be my desire.
2005-04-05T12:14:00.000Z	kkathman	InitMass	Xterm is white on black, and small fonts. I'd like to get something that I can at least modify a little.
2005-04-05T12:15:00.000Z	InitMass	kkathman	that would be eterm
2005-04-05T12:15:00.000Z	InitMass	kkathman	but i can also recommend aterm
2005-04-05T12:15:00.000Z	kkathman	InitMass	 thank you for your insight :)
2005-04-05T12:15:00.000Z	InitMass	kkathman	but eterm is easier to modify than aterm
2005-04-05T12:16:00.000Z	kkathman	InitMass	 I'll try eterm first and see if that meets my needs. Again, thank you :)
2005-04-05T12:17:00.000Z	InitMass	kkathman	sudo apt-get install eterm
2005-04-05T12:47:00.000Z	kkathman	InitMass	 Looked at both Eterm and aterm, still not quite as nice as the Konsole. Do you happen to know if Konsole will run under xfce?
