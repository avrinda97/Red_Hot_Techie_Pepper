2005-10-29T07:36:00.000Z	shgs		Hi guys!
2005-10-29T07:36:00.000Z	shgs		Does anybody use ubuntu with a serial mouse?
2005-10-29T07:36:00.000Z	intelikey	shgs	i have, yes.
2005-10-29T07:37:00.000Z	shgs	intelikey	What is the big secret?
2005-10-29T07:37:00.000Z	intelikey	shgs	there wasn't one......
2005-10-29T07:37:00.000Z	shgs	intelikey	I've put the device set to ttyS0 and protocol to Microsoft.
2005-10-29T07:37:00.000Z	shgs	intelikey	The mouse cursor appears but it does not move.
2005-10-29T07:37:00.000Z	intelikey	shgs	try ttyS1
2005-10-29T07:38:00.000Z	shgs	intelikey	When I try ttyS1, the mouse cursor does not show at all.
2005-10-29T07:38:00.000Z	intelikey	shgs	od
2005-10-29T07:39:00.000Z	shgs	intelikey	I've tried about everything on it. Downloaded GPM and compiled it but the mouse does not work there either.
2005-10-29T07:39:00.000Z	shgs	intelikey	The fact is that just yesterday, I had another distribution on it and the mouse was OK.
2005-10-29T07:39:00.000Z	shgs	intelikey	I used Conectiva, a brazilian RPM based distrib.
2005-10-29T07:40:00.000Z	shgs	intelikey	I'll try that. just a sec.
2005-10-29T07:41:00.000Z	shgs	intelikey	none of the options give any output whatsoever.
2005-10-29T07:42:00.000Z	shgs	intelikey	Does this mean that linux is not accessing the mouse?
2005-10-29T07:42:00.000Z	shgs	intelikey	Is there a module kernel for it?
2005-10-29T07:43:00.000Z	intelikey	shgs	then there is a real problem with the hardware.... err yes shgs
2005-10-29T07:43:00.000Z	shgs	intelikey	My system insists on loading psmouse module.
2005-10-29T07:43:00.000Z	shgs	intelikey	I disabled the psmouse module and put sermouse instead.
2005-10-29T07:44:00.000Z	shgs	intelikey	The weird thing is that the mouse was working in the same system with another linux distribution.
2005-10-29T07:47:00.000Z	intelikey	shgs	"sudo less /boot/Sys<tab_key> "   and use / to search for mouse search for might tell you more about what the problem is.
