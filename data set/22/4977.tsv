2007-08-25T09:43:00.000Z	angel	lemonedo	Are you using totem-xine?
2007-08-25T09:43:00.000Z	lemonedo		yes
2007-08-25T09:43:00.000Z	lemonedo		totem-xine
2007-08-25T09:45:00.000Z	angel	lemonedo	edit ~/.xine/catalog.cache and search for realaudio , change the demux priority to 10 , that should give you sound.
2007-08-25T09:46:00.000Z	lemonedo	angel	thanks, but it is already 10...
2007-08-25T09:47:00.000Z	angel	lemonedo	was it 10 by default you mean or did you change it before?
2007-08-25T09:48:00.000Z	lemonedo	angel	i think i didn't change
2007-08-25T09:48:00.000Z	lemonedo		anything
2007-08-25T09:48:00.000Z	angel	lemonedo	maybe you are looking at the wrong one, it shouldn't be 10 by default I think.
2007-08-25T09:49:00.000Z	angel	lemonedo	did you install w32codecs?
2007-08-25T09:49:00.000Z	lemonedo	angel	yes
2007-08-25T09:49:00.000Z	angel	lemonedo	try using gxine
2007-08-25T09:51:00.000Z	angel	lemonedo	in catalog.cache do a search for realadec , that one should be priority 10
2007-08-25T09:52:00.000Z	angel	lemonedo	before I meant to say real_audio not realaudio, my bad.
2007-08-25T09:52:00.000Z	lemonedo		oh
2007-08-25T09:52:00.000Z	lemonedo	angel	thanks now it works :)
2007-08-25T09:52:00.000Z	angel	lemonedo	no prob.
