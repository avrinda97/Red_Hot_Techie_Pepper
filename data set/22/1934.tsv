2009-11-26T20:25:00.000Z	Lungan		Can anyone give me a tutorial how do install dotnet framework?
2009-11-26T20:25:00.000Z	zortec	Lungan	Why not just install monodevelop?
2009-11-26T20:25:00.000Z	Lungan	zortec	how? apt-get install monodevelop
2009-11-26T20:26:00.000Z	Lungan	zortec	Im trying to install a program that gives me error because i dont have dotnet framework .exe
2009-11-26T20:27:00.000Z	zortec	Lungan	well, .NET framework would have to be installed through WINE since it's not a linux app and monodevelop is the equivalent of visual studio .NET
2009-11-26T20:28:00.000Z	Lungan	zortec	so I juse monodevelop instead of .NET
2009-11-26T20:28:00.000Z	zortec	Lungan	that is what I would use instead
2009-11-26T20:29:00.000Z	Lungan	zortec	how do I use it? Still when I run wine setup.exe I get the error "dotnetfx35setup.exe cannot be verified" or sometging like that
2009-11-26T20:30:00.000Z	zortec	Lungan	I have not installed .NET through wine so you will need to get help from people that have developed .NET applications in WINE, sorry
2009-11-26T20:38:00.000Z	zortec	Lungan	do you find it in the gnome or kde menu?
2009-11-26T20:31:00.000Z	Lungan	zortec	Okok, but can you recommend another way to install my program since it complain about an error since I dont have the dodnetfx35setup
2009-11-26T20:33:00.000Z	zortec	Lungan	just read some quick information on .NET in ubuntu and compatibility is poor in WINE and not recommended
2009-11-26T20:33:00.000Z	zortec	Lungan	take a look at other alternatives such as monodevelop, mono, or eclipse
2009-11-26T20:34:00.000Z	Lungan	zortec	yeah I have installed monodevelop, but I dont know what to do now?
2009-11-26T20:35:00.000Z	zortec	Lungan	You need to run the configure script and then type "make" in the console window
2009-11-26T20:35:00.000Z	Lungan	zortec	how?
2009-11-26T20:35:00.000Z	zortec	Lungan	do you know how to open up a terminal?
2009-11-26T20:36:00.000Z	Lungan	zortec	yep, and I know sudo
2009-11-26T20:36:00.000Z	zortec	Lungan	ok go to the dir where monodevelop was installed and you should find a configure script
2009-11-26T20:36:00.000Z	zortec	Lungan	You will type ./configure and run the script and then when it's finished, type make
2009-11-26T20:38:00.000Z	Lungan	zortec	I installed with apt-get install monodevelop shouldn't the program be ready to go then?
2009-11-26T20:39:00.000Z	zortec	Lungan	if it was installed through synaptic, there would be a menu entry for it
