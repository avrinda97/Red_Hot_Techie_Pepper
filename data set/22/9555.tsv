2004-09-29T10:28:00.000Z	toothpick	seb128	well I added sid sources and did apt-get upgrade
2004-09-29T10:29:00.000Z	toothpick	seb128	for example crafty wasn't available via the sources provided so I just added sid's from debian.
2004-09-29T10:30:00.000Z	seb128	toothpick	yes, but we made changes to hal
2004-09-29T10:30:00.000Z	seb128	toothpick	the debian version is not compatible
2004-09-29T10:30:00.000Z	toothpick		ok
2004-09-29T10:30:00.000Z	seb128	toothpick	in /etc/dbus-1/event.d/hal remove --drop-privileges if you want
