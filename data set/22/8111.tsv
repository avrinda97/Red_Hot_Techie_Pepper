2005-11-04T17:06:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	dabaR	but i cant access to some files that root can
2007-03-08T12:19:00.000Z	dabaR	Ropechoborra	why lock? so someone can not use them?
2007-03-08T12:19:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	dabaR	yes, for example i let things doing and i go away, and dont want anyone to see or touch anything
2007-03-08T12:21:00.000Z	dabaR	Ropechoborra	and can you not run the thing in the background with &? I think it would be the same...
2007-03-08T12:21:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	dabaR	dont know what is or how to do it :S
2007-03-08T12:22:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	dabaR	well i got an idea of what it is, but never done it yet
2007-03-08T12:22:00.000Z	dabaR	Ropechoborra	try in a terminal. Run a command, and put a & at the end of the line.
2007-03-08T12:23:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	dabaR	ok, and then how i bring the process back?
2007-03-08T12:23:00.000Z	dabaR	Ropechoborra	fg 1
2007-03-08T12:25:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	dabaR	Ok, i got it !  thanks! :)
2007-03-08T12:25:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	dabaR	one last thing, if i have the process already runing, how i can put it in background ?
2007-03-08T12:26:00.000Z	dabaR	Ropechoborra	ctrl-z, then bg 1
2007-03-08T12:26:00.000Z	dabaR	Ropechoborra	there is a little issue. when ran in the background, if you close the terminal, such as typing exit, the program quits too.
2007-03-08T12:27:00.000Z	dabaR	Ropechoborra	to avoid that, you can prepend the command with nohup, and that will make the command keep running even after the terminal is closed.
2007-03-08T12:28:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	dabaR	prepend ? nohup? (sorry for my english)
2007-03-08T12:28:00.000Z	dabaR	Ropechoborra	it should run. If you ctrl-z, then you stop it. But, then you run bg 1, and it should start running again.
2007-03-08T12:29:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	dabaR	but if i dont want it to stop?
2007-03-08T12:30:00.000Z	dabaR	Ropechoborra	do not want it to stop right away, or after you close the terminal.
2007-03-08T12:30:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	dabaR	i just want to let it running while the terminal is closed (or locked) and when i come back see the changes
2007-03-08T12:32:00.000Z	dabaR	Ropechoborra	running in background should do it. so something like updatedb &
2007-03-08T12:35:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	dabaR	Nop =( It justs stops, and it dies when i exit... well never mind, i guess im going to sleep, to tyred
