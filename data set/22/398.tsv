2011-10-25T01:25:00.000Z	digz		Hello.
2011-10-25T01:25:00.000Z	digz		I require urgent assistance.
2011-10-25T01:25:00.000Z	digz		I've installed Ubuntu 11.10
2011-10-25T01:25:00.000Z	digz		And my left click worked in the Live CD
2011-10-25T01:26:00.000Z	digz		however it's not functional on install.
2011-10-25T01:26:00.000Z	digz		So now I'm confined to the Live CD, with no OS.
2011-10-25T01:27:00.000Z	digz		Anyone?
2011-10-25T01:28:00.000Z	digz		Siegel - nope, it's also broken on my laptop trackpad
2011-10-25T01:29:00.000Z	digz		I'm a total n00b.
2011-10-25T01:29:00.000Z	digz		It's all greek to me at this stage.
2011-10-25T01:30:00.000Z	BarkingFish	digz	it is to most new users of a Linux distro, don't feel alone dude :)
2011-10-25T01:37:00.000Z	BarkingFish	digz	hm. Let me have a think, I'm sure there's an alternative on the keyboard to left clicking, just can't remember what it is. GIve me a moment while I google
2011-10-25T01:42:00.000Z	BarkingFish	digz	it may be possible through a terminal, CTRL+ALT+F1, and then you wouldn't need a mouse.
2011-10-25T01:42:00.000Z	BarkingFish	digz	you should use your own username and password
2011-10-25T01:45:00.000Z	BarkingFish	digz	in the terminals, your password is never echoed in any way, you have to type it slowly and it is case sensitive.
2011-10-25T01:47:00.000Z	BarkingFish	digz	- What type of mouse is it? USB or PS/2?
2011-10-25T01:49:00.000Z	BarkingFish	digz	just a thought, do you have any configuration options in your bios for legacy USB devices?
2011-10-25T01:51:00.000Z	digz	BarkingFish	plruj3: how would i do that.
2011-10-25T01:53:00.000Z	digz	BarkingFish	- this is odd. my left click doesn't work on the trackpad now.
2011-10-25T01:53:00.000Z	BarkingFish	digz	try pressing Fn + F9, should switch the touchpad off
2011-10-25T01:55:00.000Z	digz	BarkingFish	- doesn't do anything.
2011-10-25T02:06:00.000Z	digz	BarkingFish	-g good night
