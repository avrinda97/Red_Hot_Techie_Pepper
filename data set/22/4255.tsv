2008-02-08T16:46:00.000Z	maximilion		I agree, although id games rock on Linux :)
2008-02-08T16:48:00.000Z	maximilion		I have alanhaggai :)
2008-02-08T16:48:00.000Z	maximilion		156 fps in 1600x1200 :)
2008-02-08T16:49:00.000Z	Assid	maximilion	you usea CRT/LCD?
2008-02-08T16:49:00.000Z	maximilion	Assid	LCD - 156 fps is the benchmark. I can run 156 fps ingame, but screen will ofc only show 60 Hz
2008-02-08T16:50:00.000Z	Assid	maximilion	sweet.. which game?
2008-02-08T16:50:00.000Z	maximilion	Assid	I have a Dell 27"
2008-02-08T16:51:00.000Z	maximilion	Assid	I have a 6800 non-ultra (cheap) gfx card
2008-02-08T16:52:00.000Z	Assid	maximilion	sweet.. you tried this on windows?
2008-02-08T16:53:00.000Z	maximilion	Assid	Well on my C2D/ATi X1950 Pro machine Quake 3 runs faster ofc. On the same machine in XP 64-bit: totally unplayable. Maybe 30 fps.
2008-02-08T16:56:00.000Z	maximilion	Assid	Press the menu button on your monitor?
2008-02-08T16:56:00.000Z	Assid	maximilion	dont see an option to see it :(
2008-02-08T16:56:00.000Z	maximilion	Assid	Look for a menu called Hz, Settings, Display Informatin...
2008-02-08T16:59:00.000Z	maximilion	Assid	Yes, that's 60 Hz. And pixel clock depends on resolution - it's what the gfx card can output. Is there a problem?
2008-02-08T17:00:00.000Z	Assid	maximilion	nah no problem.. just wanna get the most of the machine.. ive spent enuff cash.. time to get some returns
2008-02-08T17:01:00.000Z	maximilion	Assid	Normally, even for good LCDs, in the highest resolutions you get lower Hz. But even the best LCDs can hardly go over 75 Hz.
2008-02-08T17:01:00.000Z	Assid	maximilion	yep
2008-02-08T17:02:00.000Z	maximilion	Assid	My best solution is to only have max resolution and set the screen to not scale up lower resolutions.
2008-02-08T17:03:00.000Z	Assid	maximilion	problem if you use something like media files or such where the source isnt a sclable vector
2008-02-08T17:04:00.000Z	maximilion	Assid	I have no problems at all, when I'm watcing media I'm in the desktop anyway, and when a game starts a lower resolution I get a perfect (not stretched) picture with black borders :) I like it.
2008-02-08T17:05:00.000Z	Assid	maximilion	true.. but then shifting back and forth on resolutions.. damn
2008-02-08T21:15:00.000Z	Assid	maximilion	 tuxracer! :P
