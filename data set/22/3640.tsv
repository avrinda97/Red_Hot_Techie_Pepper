2008-07-12T11:55:00.000Z	libflashsupport		anyway, thanks folks
2008-07-12T11:55:00.000Z	libflashsupport		oh btw, anyone know of a good image viewer in ubuntu hardy?
2008-07-12T11:55:00.000Z	libflashsupport		one that hopefully, hopefully does animated .gif too
2008-07-12T11:56:00.000Z	eth01	libflashsupport	the pre-installed should be fine imo
2008-07-12T11:56:00.000Z	libflashsupport	eth01	Nothing does animated flash for me, sadly.
2008-07-12T11:56:00.000Z	libflashsupport		and I don't fancy the idea of opening images in internet browsers....
2008-07-12T11:56:00.000Z	eth01	libflashsupport	macosx ?
2008-07-12T11:56:00.000Z	libflashsupport		?
2008-07-12T11:57:00.000Z	libflashsupport		err
2008-07-12T11:57:00.000Z	libflashsupport		animated .gif, not flash
2008-07-12T11:57:00.000Z	libflashsupport	eth01	hardy heron here
2008-07-12T11:57:00.000Z	eth01		nono. i'm suggesting you a better suited alternative.
2008-07-12T11:57:00.000Z	libflashsupport	eth01	:(
2008-07-12T11:57:00.000Z	eth01	libflashsupport	:)
2008-07-12T11:57:00.000Z	libflashsupport		what, does everyone hate animated .gif here ?
2008-07-12T11:58:00.000Z	eth01	libflashsupport	not quite. but ubuntu doesn't by default support it very well.
2008-07-12T11:58:00.000Z	eth01		which is why i suggested something like macosx, photoshop et cetera might be better ad hoc
2008-07-12T11:58:00.000Z	libflashsupport	eth01	well, which is why I'm asking for a recommendation, really...
2008-07-12T11:58:00.000Z	libflashsupport		Just want an image viewer.
2008-07-12T11:58:00.000Z	libflashsupport		don't care for photoshop, really.
2008-07-12T11:59:00.000Z	eth01	libflashsupport	then i can't help you
2008-07-12T11:59:00.000Z	libflashsupport	eth01	oh okay... thanks anyway
