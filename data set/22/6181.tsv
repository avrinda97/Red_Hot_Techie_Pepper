2007-01-06T15:52:00.000Z	speyer		it is possible to edit fstab so that when i boot my machine i can choose which system i want to run ubuntu or windows even if they are on diff hdd ?
2007-01-06T15:52:00.000Z	arrenlex	speyer	That's not your fstab, that's your grub conf (/boot/grub/menu.lst). And yes.
2007-01-06T15:53:00.000Z	speyer	arrenlex	erUSUL mnoir thank you
2007-01-06T15:53:00.000Z	arrenlex	speyer	...pardon? o_O
2007-01-06T15:54:00.000Z	speyer	arrenlex	erUSUL mnoir now works fine the grub.conf its ok but im going to move the linux system on a different hdd will the windows section from grub.conf still be useful as it is now ?
2007-01-06T15:55:00.000Z	arrenlex	speyer	You can't just move it, because Grub won't be able to find itself and you won't be able to boot anything. You would have to boot from the liveCD and reinstall grub on the new HD.
2007-01-06T15:56:00.000Z	speyer	arrenlex	Sphynx mnoir i will not gonna use the whole grub.conf .. only the windows settings from grub.conf which are staying on the same location will it work ?
2007-01-06T15:57:00.000Z	arrenlex	speyer	When you boot your computer, Grub reads its config from where it was installed (ubuntu drive). If you move this drive, Grub will not be able to find its config on boot, and will fail. You will have to repair it.
2007-01-06T15:58:00.000Z	arrenlex	speyer	Really all you'd have to do is follow the instructions in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2007-01-06T16:01:00.000Z	speyer	arrenlex	erUSUL mnoir i was just going to put this " http://pastebin.com/853036 " into the new fresh installed grub.conf on the brand new ubuntu os which will be on a diff hdd then windows xp .will i still be able to boot windows ? ( windows wont move )
2007-01-06T16:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	speyer	Oh, if you're installing ubuntu again, you'll be fine. I thought you were just moving the drive. The install will handle everything.
2007-01-06T16:02:00.000Z	speyer	arrenlex	yeah a fresh ubuntu install
2007-01-06T16:03:00.000Z	speyer	arrenlex	but on a diff hdd as it is now
2007-01-06T16:04:00.000Z	arrenlex	speyer	If you're installing ubuntu, it will detect and install everything just fine.
2007-01-06T16:05:00.000Z	arrenlex	speyer	No, that will not be okay. It won't detect it and you will have to add it to grub manually. I highly recommend you leave it in.
2007-01-06T16:06:00.000Z	speyer	arrenlex	Sphynx ok hope i wont gonna install ubuntu on the wrong hdd over my stuff :))
2007-01-06T16:06:00.000Z	speyer	arrenlex	Sphynx thanks a lot
2007-01-06T16:07:00.000Z	arrenlex	speyer	Make a backup.

2007-01-06T16:07:00.000Z	arrenlex	speyer	...well, you can probably leave the pirated music and porn out of the backup. =P
2007-01-06T16:07:00.000Z	speyer	arrenlex	:))))
2007-01-06T16:08:00.000Z	speyer	arrenlex	a bit less porn yeah :D
