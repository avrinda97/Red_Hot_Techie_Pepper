2007-09-05T16:04:00.000Z	bullgard4		English help wanted: What does it mean to 'assert a bit in a status register'? Is there another word here for 'to assert'?
2007-09-05T16:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bullgard4	"set" possibly?
2009-01-26T22:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bullgard4	because one might not be set up on it
2009-01-26T22:54:00.000Z	bullgard4	gordonjcp	I do not know the phrase: "to be set up on sth." Please rephrase your answer so that I can understand it.
2009-01-26T22:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bullgard4	I don't know what you're asking
2009-01-26T22:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bullgard4	your eth0 interface might not have an address set
2009-01-26T22:56:00.000Z	bullgard4	gordonjcp	How can an network interface be active without having an internet address?
2009-01-26T22:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bullgard4	easily
2009-01-26T22:57:00.000Z	bullgard4	gordonjcp	Can you elaborate.
2009-01-26T22:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bullgard4	what if you weren't using it for TCP/IP ?
2009-01-26T22:57:00.000Z	bullgard4	gordonjcp	I can only use interfaces vis TCP/IP. Anything else is obsolete.
2009-01-26T22:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bullgard4	I suppose you've never used a NAS then
2009-01-26T23:00:00.000Z	bullgard4	gordonjcp	It is true that I have never used a Netware Access Server. But this irrelevant for finding the answer to the question put.
2009-01-26T23:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bullgard4	not Netware, NAS
2009-01-26T23:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bullgard4	network attached storage
2009-01-26T23:01:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bullgard4	I have some computers here with two ethernet NICs in, one of which has no IP address set
2009-01-26T23:01:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bullgard4	the one with no IP address is only used for raw Ethernet frames
2009-01-26T23:05:00.000Z	bullgard4	gordonjcp	Thank you for commenting.
2009-04-21T19:29:00.000Z	bullgard4	gordonjcp	Please try to read. I have not been impatient.
2009-04-21T19:29:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bullgard4	you have been rather rude, though
2009-05-11T15:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bullgard4	you already asked that, and i already told you the answer
2009-05-11T15:43:00.000Z	bullgard4	gordonjcp	No. You did not.
