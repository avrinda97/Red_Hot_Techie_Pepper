2007-08-04T05:18:00.000Z	ztomic	kjp	did you try the "user" option in fstab?
2007-08-04T05:19:00.000Z	kjp	ztomic	no, what's the syntax ?
2007-08-04T05:20:00.000Z	ztomic	kjp	user, rw, noauto should  work.
2007-08-04T05:21:00.000Z	kjp	ztomic	nope. it currently reads rw,user,auto and the user can't unmount or write to it
2007-08-04T05:23:00.000Z	ztomic	kjp	the drive is formatted right? can you mount it as root?
2007-08-04T05:23:00.000Z	kjp	ztomic	yes, drive is formatted (xfs) and user can MOUNT it, but not unmount it, and not write to it (touch file)
2007-08-04T05:26:00.000Z	ztomic	kjp	did you see this? http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/Linux+XFS-HOWTO.html
2007-08-04T05:27:00.000Z	kjp	ztomic	yes I did. havnen't found any clues there.
2007-08-04T05:30:00.000Z	ztomic	kjp	interesting. lemme mess with this little thumb drive I have. It's something worth knowing. I'll let you know if I have any success.
2007-08-04T05:51:00.000Z	ztomic	kjp	#chmod MOUNTPOINT 666
2007-08-04T05:51:00.000Z	kjp	ztomic	lol! I just figured that out too
2007-08-04T05:55:00.000Z	ztomic	kjp	great! sheesh! now I cant unmount this usb drive because xfsprogs is using it. heh!
2007-08-04T05:55:00.000Z	kjp	ztomic	lol, -f it ?
2007-08-04T06:01:00.000Z	ztomic	kjp	why do you use XFS?
2007-08-04T06:02:00.000Z	kjp	ztomic	because reiser and ext3 have both cost me a ton of data in the past. XFS has never failed to be recovarable.
2007-08-04T06:02:00.000Z	kjp	ztomic	it's journaled, quick, etc.
2007-08-04T06:03:00.000Z	ztomic	kjp	I read some good stuff about it. I have never used it. I use Reiserfs.
2007-08-04T06:04:00.000Z	kjp	ztomic	Reiserfs ... almost cost me my degree. the filesystem ate itself and cost me a semester of data
2007-08-04T06:05:00.000Z	ztomic	kjp	I read you can growfs easily. That would be useful to me.
2007-08-04T06:05:00.000Z	kjp	ztomic	yeah. it's nice. I highly commend it
2007-08-04T06:06:00.000Z	ztomic	kjp	I may try it on the disk I use for video.
2007-08-04T06:06:00.000Z	kjp	ztomic	enjoy
