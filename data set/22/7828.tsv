2006-07-15T11:48:00.000Z	Subhuman	sri_	yes sure it will just pause, and the upload , in bittorrent you "share", so the more of the file "in this case antitrust" that you upload to others, the faster your downloads, but obv, some people do not want that so they cap it ( give a maximum upload speed) but it also means your download is slower.
2006-07-15T11:50:00.000Z	sri_	Subhuman	if i share it then my downloading speed decreased?
