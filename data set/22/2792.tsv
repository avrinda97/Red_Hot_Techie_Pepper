2009-03-23T10:24:00.000Z	josh-l		hey folks I need to find libqtcore4 package... can anyone help me pls
2009-03-23T10:25:00.000Z	LordKow	josh-l	libqt4-core
2009-03-23T10:26:00.000Z	josh-l		oh thanks LordKow how did you find it?
2009-03-23T10:26:00.000Z	LordKow	josh-l	i searched in synaptic
2009-03-23T10:26:00.000Z	josh-l	LordKow	with what parametrs?
2009-03-23T10:27:00.000Z	LordKow	josh-l	i simply searched for qt4 and started looking at the results until i found the package you were looking for
2009-03-23T10:27:00.000Z	LordKow	josh-l	and i must say libqt4core should exist... libqt4-core is a "dummy" package but it should still get you what you are looking for. "sudo apt-get install libqt4core" will install the same thing
2009-03-23T10:28:00.000Z	josh-l	LordKow	weird, maybe i already had it installed then thx
2009-03-23T10:28:00.000Z	josh-l	LordKow	trying to build firefox-qt
2009-03-23T10:29:00.000Z	LordKow	josh-l	sorry its libqtcore4
2009-03-23T10:29:00.000Z	LordKow	josh-l	if you're trying to compile it you will likely need libqt4-dev
2009-03-23T10:30:00.000Z	josh-l		yeah got that one LordKow thx
2009-03-23T10:31:00.000Z	josh-l	LordKow	maybe you can help me here I keep getting stuck on this error when trying to compile: configure: error: --enable-application=APP was not specified and is required.
2009-03-23T10:34:00.000Z	LordKow	josh-l	when you run ./configure you need to specify --enable-application=something . I believe the something you are looking for is "browser"
2009-03-23T10:34:00.000Z	LordKow		i have not built firefox for a long time but browser sounds right
2009-03-23T10:35:00.000Z	josh-l		okay I'll try that thank
2009-03-23T10:35:00.000Z	josh-l		s
2009-03-23T10:42:00.000Z	josh-l	LordKow	did firefox take foorever to build when you did last?
2009-03-23T10:43:00.000Z	LordKow	josh-l	yep.
2009-03-23T10:44:00.000Z	josh-l	LordKow	remember how long abouts?
2009-03-23T10:44:00.000Z	josh-l		i mean should i go to bed :)
2009-03-23T10:45:00.000Z	LordKow	josh-l	depends on how fast your computer is.
