2011-06-09T20:34:00.000Z	phong_		I have intel 80GB SSD is it faster?
2011-06-09T20:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	phong_	 would depend on the exact drive if its faster then a given sata hd. I would say its faster.. but   is it worth it.
2011-06-09T20:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	phong_	 is it worth the speed vs tjhe cost.. vs the small size

2011-09-13T05:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	phong_	 can the windows machine see its own shares? :)
