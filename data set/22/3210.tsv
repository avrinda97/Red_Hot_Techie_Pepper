2008-11-09T04:08:00.000Z	goat|lappy	Marcus_123	unfortunately my searches are coming up with not much,  you can try googling with such search terms as mouse clicks X don't work at edges don't respond intrepid ubuntu,   or you can try detailing your problem again, any maybe someone here will know whats up
