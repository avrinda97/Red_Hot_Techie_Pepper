2007-08-29T08:56:00.000Z	nathan		can anyone tell me why mplayer works when I run it as mplayer -vo x11 (and how to make vlc and totem work in a similar fashion?)
2007-08-29T08:57:00.000Z	SeveredCross	nathan	For VLC you have to go to its preferences and change its video output thing.
2007-08-29T09:00:00.000Z	nathan	SeveredCross	do you kno what needs to be set exactly?
2007-08-29T09:01:00.000Z	nathan	SeveredCross	oh I need to change video output module to x11 then right?
2007-09-08T11:09:00.000Z	nathan	SeveredCross	because if I set it up that way, I could install programs and administer without having to log in as myself or root to do it, and at the same time the user wouldn't be able to mess anything up
2007-09-08T11:09:00.000Z	SeveredCross	nathan	Then just remove them from the admin group.
2007-09-08T11:10:00.000Z	nathan	SeveredCross	I want to be able to administer from anyone's account
2007-09-08T11:11:00.000Z	SeveredCross	nathan	How is it LESS secure to not have a root password?
2007-09-08T11:11:00.000Z	nathan	SeveredCross	because now any old bum who has sudo access is exactly the same as a full root
2007-09-08T11:12:00.000Z	nathan	SeveredCross	that means all you need for root access is ANYONE's access who is on sudo
2007-09-08T11:12:00.000Z	SeveredCross	nathan	Yeah but that's a bit harder to accomolish.
2007-09-08T11:13:00.000Z	nathan	SeveredCross	having full access to many users is not more secure than only to one imo.
2007-09-08T11:14:00.000Z	SeveredCross	nathan	I really don't see your point. If you don't want everyone to have root access, remove their sudo privileges.
2007-09-08T11:15:00.000Z	nathan	SeveredCross	my point is this: imagine a network of 40 people using ubuntu. every time you want to install something on someone's computer you have to go over and log out completely and then log in as root just to do it because they don't have sudo access. waste of time imo. wouldn't it be much nicer to have it where all you had to do is go to synaptic and type in the root pw?
2007-09-08T11:15:00.000Z	SeveredCross	nathan	Then like I said, look into editing /etc/sudoers to your whims.
2007-09-08T11:17:00.000Z	nathan	SeveredCross	that wouldn't help anything because I would still have to log out and back in as root
2007-09-08T11:17:00.000Z	nathan	SeveredCross	orly? let me take another look at that.
2007-09-08T11:17:00.000Z	SeveredCross	nathan	If you modify it right, it should.
2007-09-08T11:19:00.000Z	nathan	SeveredCross	alright well I'll look into it further then.. thanks for your attention
2007-09-08T11:20:00.000Z	SeveredCross	nathan	The flag you're looking for is rootpw by the way.
2007-09-08T11:20:00.000Z	nathan	SeveredCross	ok I will thanks
2007-09-08T11:20:00.000Z	nathan	SeveredCross	I can see that I might need this option soon so I want to be prepared for it is all.
