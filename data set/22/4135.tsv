2010-05-23T10:18:00.000Z	chelz	jmichaelx	is it like a quick drumbeat?
2010-05-23T10:19:00.000Z	chelz	jmichaelx	go to "System >> Preferences >> Sound" and disable system sounds is one way, is that satisfactory?
2010-05-23T10:19:00.000Z	jmichaelx	chelz	well, it was in firefox. to stop that, i renamed an audio file in /usr/share/souns/ubuntu/stereo
2010-05-23T10:19:00.000Z	chelz	jmichaelx	sure, that's one way
2010-05-23T10:20:00.000Z	jmichaelx	chelz	i already explaned that didn't work. it stopped those sounds in gnome, but not in kde
2010-05-23T10:20:00.000Z	chelz	jmichaelx	kde has a different place for system sounds
2010-05-23T10:21:00.000Z	jmichaelx	chelz	yes, i will repost what i typed a minute ago or so
2010-05-23T10:21:00.000Z	jmichaelx	chelz	without gnome installed, kubuntu does not do this. however, with gnome installed, chromioum browser and firefox both make these stupid sounds, even if they are turned off in gnome.
2010-05-23T10:22:00.000Z	jmichaelx	chelz	AFAIK, there is no way to turn them off in kde settings
2010-05-23T10:24:00.000Z	chelz	jmichaelx	what does the sound sound like?
2010-05-23T10:24:00.000Z	chelz	jmichaelx	did the renaming of that file not fix it?
2010-05-23T10:25:00.000Z	chelz	jmichaelx	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-sounds/+bug/411476
2010-05-23T10:25:00.000Z	chelz	jmichaelx	/usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/dialog-question.wav
2010-05-23T10:25:00.000Z	jmichaelx	chelz	it fixed things in firefox, but the sound being used in chromium is different, and apparently from a different directory
2010-05-23T10:26:00.000Z	jmichaelx	chelz	i have already renamed dialog-question.ogg
2010-05-23T10:28:00.000Z	jmichaelx	chelz	i believe the sound chromium is making is coming from another directory. i cannot imagine who thought these sounds up, and enabled them by default
2010-05-23T10:30:00.000Z	chelz	jmichaelx	well you could hunt through the kde sound directories to see if any of those are the ones that are playing
2010-05-23T10:31:00.000Z	jmichaelx	chelz	this problem does not start until ubuntu-desktop is installed
2010-05-23T10:33:00.000Z	jmichaelx	chelz	Scunizi, are these sounds enabled by default in ubuntu?
2010-05-23T10:55:00.000Z	jmichaelx	chelz	 scunizi: i was able to fix the problem. what i had to do was remove 'ubuntu-sounds' (good riddance), log back into a gnome session, and "un-mute" system sounds
2010-05-23T10:56:00.000Z	chelz	jmichaelx	bit of a scorched-earth fix but yeah, as long as you as a user are happy
2010-05-23T10:58:00.000Z	jmichaelx	chelz	i cannot see how it is a scorched-earth fix... in kde no one wants or needs those sounds.... and even in gnome, the first thing i usually do is mute them/shut them off
