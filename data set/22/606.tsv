2011-07-27T13:03:00.000Z	wasanzy		After installing my ubuntu 11.04, I saw that it doesn't have an option to Hibernate, when I did some googling, it sound like the OS came with Hibernate b4. even my friend who uses the same machine am using have a Hibernate option. my question is how do I add Hibernate to my OS?
2011-07-27T13:03:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	do you have a swap partition?
2011-07-27T13:04:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	is it bigger than your ram?
2011-07-27T13:05:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	is the swap partition bigger than your ram size
2011-07-27T13:07:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	then that is why you can't hibernate
2011-07-27T13:07:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	hibernate requires a swap partition bigger than your ram
2011-07-27T13:09:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	it won't give you the option because you don't have sufficient swap
2011-07-27T13:10:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	i suppose you can make a bigger swap and restart then the option should appear
2011-07-27T13:10:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	make sure you're not using the swap partition while you resize it
2011-07-27T13:16:00.000Z	wasanzy	ThinkT510	how do I stop the swap? I tried killing the pid but it didn't work
2011-07-27T13:17:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	i find it easier to use gparted, you can do it all there
2011-07-27T13:25:00.000Z	wasanzy	ThinkT510	Do you think 5000MB is good
2011-07-27T13:25:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	good for what?
2011-07-27T13:26:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	ah yes, sorry; 5000MB is under 5GB
2011-07-27T13:27:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	a general rule for a swap size is roughly 1.5 times the size of ram
2011-07-27T13:29:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	that is a waste of diskdrive space
2011-07-27T13:51:00.000Z	wasanzy	ThinkT510	I deleted the swap partition and created new one 5GB and restarted the machine, but still the Hibernate is not showing
2011-07-27T14:20:00.000Z	wasanzy	ThinkT510	hi
2011-07-27T14:21:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	got hibernate working?
2011-07-27T14:22:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	does it boot quicker than a cold boot?
2011-07-27T14:25:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernation_(computing)
2011-07-27T14:26:00.000Z	ThinkT510	wasanzy	if it's the same speed, i don't see the point in using it, it would just drain battery power
