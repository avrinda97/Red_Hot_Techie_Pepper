2009-12-30T23:55:00.000Z	csmith1994		my wireless card is not being recognised on ubuntu even with the drivers
2009-12-30T23:57:00.000Z	sal_	csmith1994	the bcm4312 is only partially supported, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
2009-12-30T23:59:00.000Z	sal_	csmith1994	your chip is only partially suppoerted, which means it does not work well yet.  what do you have installed for drivers?
2009-12-31T00:00:00.000Z	csmith1994	sal_	I have b43 installed
2009-12-31T00:00:00.000Z	sal_	csmith1994	b43 what?  kernel, ndiswrapper, fwcutter .. ??
2009-12-31T00:01:00.000Z	csmith1994	sal_	fwcutter
2009-12-31T00:02:00.000Z	csmith1994	sal_	Can I pm you?
2009-12-31T00:02:00.000Z	sal_	csmith1994	check for bcmwl-kernel-source in synaptic
2009-12-31T00:03:00.000Z	csmith1994	sal_	im not currently in my ubuntu environment. Im in windows 7 because I have no other alternate connection
2009-12-31T00:04:00.000Z	csmith1994	sal_	if I had an alternate connection I'd just go to terminal and run sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter
2009-12-31T00:05:00.000Z	sal_	csmith1994	you said fwcutter is already installed .. ??
2009-12-31T00:05:00.000Z	csmith1994	sal_	it is but if I automatically install it it downloads the driver according to the page you linked me to earlier
2009-12-31T00:07:00.000Z	sal_	csmith1994	is your wifi STA?
2009-12-31T00:08:00.000Z	csmith1994	sal_	I don't know when I do lspci it says Broadcom BCM4312 802.11b/g Network adapter
2009-12-31T00:08:00.000Z	sal_	csmith1994	with that chip, i think you need to use the bcmwl-kernel-source, not fwcutter
2009-12-31T00:09:00.000Z	csmith1994	sal_	could you tell me how to do that
2009-12-31T00:13:00.000Z	sal_	csmith1994	the bcmwl-kernel-source should be on the cd, if you enable cd as a source, you could load it that way
2009-12-31T00:13:00.000Z	csmith1994	sal_	i didnt use a cd I used the wubi installer
2009-12-31T00:13:00.000Z	sal_	csmith1994	otherwise find a wire to plug into
2009-12-31T00:14:00.000Z	sal_	csmith1994	well, your just asking for double trouble then .. ;-|
2009-12-31T00:14:00.000Z	csmith1994	sal_	i downloaded the windows installer from the website
