2010-03-02T07:42:00.000Z	Maletor		OK - I have 2TBs that I just put into a RAID5 (three drives - as such [http://lookpic.com/i/542/IvfLaw5W.png]. I want to put my fourth drive, the one with all the data I want preserved, added (grown?) to the RAID array. How do I do this?
2010-03-02T07:43:00.000Z	cfedde	Maletor	it's hard to grow a raid group once it has been created.  You'll have to stage the data somewhere so that it is available to be merged after the filesystem is created and mounted.
2010-03-02T07:45:00.000Z	Maletor	cfedde	- i'm so lost i don't know where to begin
2010-03-02T07:48:00.000Z	cfedde	Maletor	when a raid group is initialized it will loose all the data in the group.
2010-03-02T07:49:00.000Z	cfedde	Maletor	exactly.  You can stage all the data somewhere else.

2010-03-02T07:51:00.000Z	cfedde	Maletor	you can grow a file system that is built on LVM but only through concatination. (raid 0)
2010-03-02T07:52:00.000Z	cfedde	Maletor	if you want to add a disk to a raid group then the data has to be re-striped over all the drives in the group.
2010-03-02T07:53:00.000Z	cfedde	Maletor	current lunux md based ext4fs raid groups don't support that.
2010-03-02T07:54:00.000Z	cfedde	Maletor	stage all the data somewhere else (cd, another drive something) make the new raid group.
2010-03-02T07:54:00.000Z	Maletor	cfedde	- i might be able to get hold of a temp. holding space, but for hypothetical how would you do this?
2010-03-02T07:54:00.000Z	cfedde	Maletor	copy the data back to the raid group.
2010-03-02T07:55:00.000Z	Maletor	cfedde	how do i add my 1tb after i backup the data?
2010-03-02T07:55:00.000Z	cfedde	Maletor	even if everything works perfectly you still need a backup.
2010-03-02T07:57:00.000Z	cfedde	Maletor	familiarize yourself with the procedure for creating a raid group. decide on a plan that best meets your need. then implement. http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.html
2010-03-02T07:58:00.000Z	cfedde	Maletor	if you have a disk controler that supports raid you can do it at that level too.
2010-03-02T07:59:00.000Z	Maletor	cfedde	i don't think i have a hardware controller but my motherboard supports fake raid
2010-03-02T08:00:00.000Z	Maletor	cfedde	i definitely want RAID 5 - i don't want to lose data
2010-03-02T08:00:00.000Z	cfedde	Maletor	you could buy a device like the drobo that lets you add and move drives through proprietery magic.
2010-03-02T08:12:00.000Z	Maletor	cfedde	- are you still around?
2010-03-02T08:12:00.000Z	cfedde	Maletor	I've heard out of band that adding a drive to a raid5 might work.  I just would not want to do it without good backups first.
2010-03-02T08:14:00.000Z	cfedde	Maletor	brjann from this channel overheard our conversation and asserted that it has worked for him.
