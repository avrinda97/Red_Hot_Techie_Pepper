2009-10-24T17:03:00.000Z	WiresAP		I'm trying to install ubuntu netbook remix, and have gotten to the partitioning stages, and I am a little stuck. I keep reading about logical partitions online, but don't see the options to create one - is a single primary partition set to ext3, boot at /, 75 GB, enough to continue?
2009-10-24T17:04:00.000Z	wirechief	WiresAP	make a extended partition and then create logicals from it
2009-10-24T17:05:00.000Z	WiresAP	wirechief	I am unclear on the steps to do so - I have created the partition I mentioned before, but see no option or button to create a logical within the installer
2009-10-24T17:07:00.000Z	wirechief	WiresAP	you make a extended partiton from your last primary (only 4 primarys are allowed) it will occupy all the remaining space, then you can resize the extended into smaller logicals .
2009-10-24T17:12:00.000Z	WiresAP	wirechief	the eeepc comes with 4 primaries already - /dev/sda1 is ntfs, /dev/sda2 was ntfs, is now ext3, /dev/sda3 is fat32 (?) and /dev/sda4 is not labeled, and I'm not touching it. When I try to lower the partition space of ext3, I end up with unusable space. How or when do I create logicals? Is it the next step in the installer? Or is there some piece of magic that I am missing?
2009-10-24T17:15:00.000Z	wirechief	WiresAP	well i have a Acer aspire netbook sda1 and sda2 are windows junk, i defragged the sda2 then resized it,then i used the unallocated space as ext3 extended, then i made two smaller partitions from it as logicals, i used gparted to do this.
2009-10-24T17:16:00.000Z	wirechief	WiresAP	i think there is a 5gb sdax not sure if it was sda3 or so i left it alone.
2009-10-24T17:16:00.000Z	WiresAP	wirechief	I seem to have the same sdax
2009-10-24T17:17:00.000Z	WiresAP	wirechief	I am still very unclear on this step - "then i made two smaller partitions from it as logicals"
2009-10-24T17:17:00.000Z	wirechief	WiresAP	i used a livecd of gparted to resize and to make the extended and then the logicals from it
2009-10-24T17:18:00.000Z	wirechief	WiresAP	the extended is the free space from resizing the sda2, it is made into a extended, then you can make logicals from it.
2009-10-24T17:20:00.000Z	WiresAP	wirechief	I already have it formatted in extended, and see no options for logicals anywhere - not in edit partition section, nor anywhere else
2009-10-24T17:20:00.000Z	WiresAP	wirechief	is it safe to sinply hit forward?
2009-10-24T17:21:00.000Z	wirechief	WiresAP	the extended free space from resizing the sda2 for me was about 25gb, i then made a couple 22 logicals and one swap from the extended.
2009-10-24T17:21:00.000Z	WiresAP	wirechief	I have 60 gb fro, the resizing of sda2
2009-10-24T17:22:00.000Z	wirechief	WiresAP	you probably should google for a howto gparted there are all kinds of em out there and can give you different ideas on how to proceed.
2009-10-24T17:23:00.000Z	WiresAP	wirechief	the idea of having to get another usb to load another program to be able to install ubuntu is depressing
2009-10-24T17:26:00.000Z	wirechief	WiresAP	well i guess i did make it easier by using a external usb dvd player and a cd with gparted live. i dont think ubuntu comes with gparted, you would of had to install it.
2009-10-24T17:27:00.000Z	WiresAP	wirechief	I am poor - I cannot afford an external dvd player
2009-10-24T17:28:00.000Z	wirechief	WiresAP	well i guess the best thing is get more knowledge, you can try google , you should be able to find some excellent howto's
2009-10-24T17:28:00.000Z	wirechief	WiresAP	n8tuser is willing to take you further into this, good luck....
2009-10-24T17:30:00.000Z	WiresAP	wirechief	thanks for the help (the reason I came here is because some of the how tos didn't explain certain steps, and I am currently stuck on the logical part)
