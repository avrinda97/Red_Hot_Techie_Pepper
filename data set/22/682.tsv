2011-05-12T03:34:00.000Z	mk44		Im having problems with my DNS server inn 11.04. when I try to connect to the internet i get this error message 105:"Unable to resolve the server's DNS address." ive checked and there is no proxie or firewall and the internet works on other computers here
2011-05-12T03:34:00.000Z	LAcan	mk44	the DNS server is listed as an IP address and NOT a hostname right?
2011-05-12T03:35:00.000Z	mk44	LAcan	im not sure what you mean, in the resolv.conf it states "# Generated by NetworkManager
2011-05-12T03:36:00.000Z	LAcan	mk44	resolv.conf is depricated, dont use that
2011-05-12T03:36:00.000Z	LAcan	mk44	ok open up a console window and type "ifconfig"
2011-05-12T03:37:00.000Z	mk44	LAcan	I dont understand...

2011-05-12T03:43:00.000Z	LAcan	mk44	i dont understand... ur connected to the internet and using DNS to be on IRC... there are multiple network cards?
2011-05-12T03:44:00.000Z	mk44	LAcan	no, im on my netbook, using the wifi on a machine with 11.04 which can connect to this IRC, but 99% of the time it times out when loading webpages because of a "DNS error"
2011-05-12T03:46:00.000Z	LAcan	mk44	hrmmmmm any othe rmachines on your network that work properly?
2011-05-12T03:47:00.000Z	mk44	LAcan	yeah there are like 4 other computers here running windows which are fine =(
2011-05-12T03:47:00.000Z	LAcan	mk44	ok go to one of those and open up cmd.exe then type "ipconfig /all" see what the DNS is for those working machines
