2010-09-07T02:59:00.000Z	ikonia		don't worry about it - lets move on
2010-09-07T03:00:00.000Z	glebihan	ikonia	depends on the configuration
2010-09-07T03:01:00.000Z	ikonia	glebihan	yes, and the default 10.04 is no, non-lts update
2010-09-07T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	glebihan	careful that may remove root to as the uid is not uinque
2010-09-09T12:08:00.000Z	glebihan	ikonia	his sshd_config file was empty
2010-09-09T12:09:00.000Z	ikonia	glebihan	that can't happen from an install, as the md5 check would fail
2010-09-09T12:10:00.000Z	glebihan	ikonia	that's why I suggested he made a complete reinstallation
2010-09-11T21:54:00.000Z	ikonia	glebihan	it uses upstart, so that won't be full any more
2010-09-11T21:56:00.000Z	glebihan	ikonia	unless I misunderstood something, running "service servicename" calls the /etc/init.d/servicename ?
2011-08-18T15:35:00.000Z	glebihan	ikonia	is update-rc.d still in use with upstart ?
2011-08-18T15:36:00.000Z	ikonia	glebihan	I believe so
2011-08-18T15:37:00.000Z	glebihan	ikonia	the man page only mentions System V scripts
2011-08-18T15:37:00.000Z	ikonia	glebihan	really, could be wrong
2011-08-18T15:37:00.000Z	ikonia	glebihan	as in I could be wrong
2011-10-01T16:54:00.000Z	glebihan	ikonia	chroot : as a matter of fact, I think the option has been removed from the installer in natty
2011-10-01T16:54:00.000Z	ikonia	glebihan	really, had sad and dissapointing
2011-10-01T16:56:00.000Z	glebihan	ikonia	I agree with you. As far as I know, only the alternate CD still has this option
2011-11-01T18:00:00.000Z	glebihan	ikonia	version 3 of gedit is not a development one (it's in the oneiric repos)
2011-11-01T18:00:00.000Z	ikonia	glebihan	it's listed 2.3 as "stable"
2011-11-03T03:22:00.000Z	glebihan	ikonia	what do you mean ? lubuntu is one of the official ubuntu versions
2011-11-03T03:22:00.000Z	ikonia	glebihan	I didn't say it wasn't
2011-11-03T03:23:00.000Z	glebihan	ikonia	ok misunderstood you then
