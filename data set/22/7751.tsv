2010-05-07T02:04:00.000Z	thoeger		Hello channel! Dunno if this is the appropriate channnel. I have a dir with ~500 files, named by a convention that gives me no way to filter them. I have three lists of file names, the files in each of which I want to put into a folder. Any ways to do this efficiently?

2010-07-19T15:59:00.000Z	thoeger	erUSUL	some are but not the one named - is it a dumbed down version that Ubuntu installs, or maybe I need an extra package...?
