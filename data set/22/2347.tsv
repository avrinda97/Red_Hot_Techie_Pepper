2009-08-07T14:56:00.000Z	muse		hey.. I am trying to install ubuntu through the net using the proxy apt-cacher-ng while it is offline. The prob is that everytime it gets to the fetching release files stage it bombs out saying that the repo is not available. So my question is what is the recommended program to install to get the installer thinking it is interfacing with the internet?
2009-08-07T14:57:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	how can you download threw a offline proxy
2009-08-07T14:59:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	then you have a server side issue
2009-08-07T15:00:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	you must be missing files
2009-08-07T15:01:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	why go threw all this anyways
2009-08-07T15:01:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	if its networks use the net
2009-08-07T15:03:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	making a pxe installer server would be the best way
2009-08-07T15:03:00.000Z	muse	gogeta1	I have
2009-08-07T15:04:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	 https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Installation/LocalNet
2009-08-07T15:08:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	just a matter of pluging them in
2009-08-07T15:09:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	you cant massboot offline
2009-08-07T15:09:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	you need some kind of local server
2009-08-07T15:10:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	well you cant move file by magic
2009-08-07T15:11:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	for the offline ones you need a cd or something
2009-08-07T15:11:00.000Z	muse	gogeta1	no cd drives
2009-08-07T15:12:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	for the networks ones you can make a pxe innstaller server
2009-08-07T15:12:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	they netboot aand install the os
2009-08-07T15:13:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	usb boot the non networked ones or something
2009-08-07T15:13:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	or even a pce boot floppy
2009-08-07T15:16:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	or walk around with a usb stick netboot them with a ubuntu network install
2009-08-07T15:16:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	once it starts installing you can move to the next pc
2009-08-07T15:23:00.000Z	gogeta1	muse	you best option is hear https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/Netboot you make a pxe server with the ubuntu cd as its os and it can mass install over a network
