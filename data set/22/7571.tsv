2006-05-28T05:58:00.000Z	kuja		Why do you have to recompile your kernel?
2006-05-28T05:58:00.000Z	Anusien	kuja	appearantly it's necessary to get wifi going
2006-05-28T05:59:00.000Z	kuja		Is it? Are you sure the necessary module doesn't exist already prebuilt?
2006-05-28T05:59:00.000Z	kuja		You can make sure by checking `modutils`
2006-05-28T05:59:00.000Z	kuja		err, run `modconf`
2006-05-28T06:00:00.000Z	Anusien		modconf doesn't work either
2006-05-28T06:00:00.000Z	kuja	Anusien	And what do you mean by "doesn't work?"
2006-05-28T06:00:00.000Z	Anusien		It's the broadcom 34xx driver, and it's supposed ot be in the kernel by default, but it seems not to be
2006-05-28T06:00:00.000Z	Anusien		'modconf': command not found
2006-05-28T06:01:00.000Z	kuja	Anusien	sudo apt-get install modconf
2006-05-28T06:01:00.000Z	kuja	Anusien	Ubuntu kernels come built with most kernel modules.
2006-05-28T06:01:00.000Z	kuja		All you have to do is find the module and simply load it.
2006-05-28T06:01:00.000Z	Anusien		okay, how do I find the module?  I know what it's supposed to be called
2006-05-28T06:02:00.000Z	kuja	Anusien	Well, what you want to do is, install modconf and find it through there.
2006-05-28T06:02:00.000Z	kuja	Anusien	If you know what it's called, then looking for it through modconf should be no problem.
2006-05-28T06:02:00.000Z	Anusien		it's not there
2006-05-28T06:03:00.000Z	kuja	Anusien	What's the module name?
2006-05-28T06:03:00.000Z	Anusien		bcm43xx
2006-05-28T06:04:00.000Z	kuja	Anusien	That's impossible. It's there.
2006-05-28T06:04:00.000Z	kuja		I only say this because I have several Ubuntu kernels and they *all* have that module.
2006-05-28T06:04:00.000Z	Anusien		I don't see it.  How do I make sure it's on my computer?
2006-05-28T06:04:00.000Z	kuja	Anusien	It's not that you don't see it, you're looking in the wrong place. How are you finding it?>
