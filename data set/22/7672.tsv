2006-01-24T16:47:00.000Z	pashaw	xored_	  if its on   typing iwconfig   should clearly list it         the default breezy driver  will do WEP   but not WPA
2006-01-24T16:47:00.000Z	pashaw	xored_	  WPA  youll need to compile the newest driver and firmware
2006-01-24T16:47:00.000Z	xored_	pashaw	i need WPA in any case, what shall i do ?
2006-01-24T16:48:00.000Z	pashaw	xored_	  google   ipw2200   the drivers are an open project  with the firmware
2006-01-24T16:48:00.000Z	xored_	pashaw	http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/ ?
