2010-06-20T08:50:00.000Z	noob123		do flv or mpg files from watching movies on the internet get saved in tmp files on ubuntu anywhere? any way to delete them?
2010-06-20T08:50:00.000Z	noob123		i used to have the shut down option on the upper right corner of the screen but now my chat thing is like overlapping it and i cant get access to it anymore.  I did right click and went 2 add panel to add the shut down icon again but is there anyway i can get the original one back?
