2008-05-30T02:27:00.000Z	jadams		when I use vim inside of screen, I don't have a 256 color term anymore.  Is there a way around this?
2008-05-30T02:27:00.000Z	jrib	jadams	using gnome-terminal?
2008-05-30T02:28:00.000Z	jadams		yup
2008-05-30T02:28:00.000Z	jadams		remoted in

2008-05-30T02:28:00.000Z	jrib	jadams	erm, that was for you ^
2008-05-30T02:28:00.000Z	jadams	jrib	I ssh into my machine at work, use vim, it's 256 colors.  Open a screen -D -R on that server, use vim, it's 16 colors
2008-05-30T02:28:00.000Z	jrib	jadams	set t_Co=256
2008-05-30T02:28:00.000Z	jadams	jrib	I've done that in vim...
2008-05-30T02:28:00.000Z	jadams	jrib	it's only in screen
2008-05-30T02:29:00.000Z	jrib	jadams	that's all I do here
2008-05-30T02:29:00.000Z	jrib	jadams	wait, what version of ubuntu?
2008-05-30T02:29:00.000Z	jadams	jrib	ok, well I don't get it...I can't even use vim it's so garish in 16 color mode.
2008-05-30T02:29:00.000Z	jadams	jrib	hardy, all around
2008-05-30T02:30:00.000Z	jrib	jadams	in previous versions I had to rebuild screen, but that isn't the case in hardy
2008-05-30T02:30:00.000Z	jadams	jrib	well, I'll rebuild screen later I supopse
2008-05-30T02:31:00.000Z	jadams	jrib	the machine was an upgrade, not a hardy base install
2008-05-30T02:31:00.000Z	jrib	jadams	well, you don't have to in hardy.  Check what version of the screen package you have
2008-05-30T02:32:00.000Z	jadams	jrib	Screen version 4.00.03 (FAU) 23-Oct-06
2008-05-30T02:32:00.000Z	jrib	jadams	nah, what version of the ubuntu package?  apt-cache policy screen
2008-05-30T02:33:00.000Z	jadams	jrib	http://pastie.caboo.se/205641
2008-05-30T02:34:00.000Z	jrib	jadams	make sure t_Co is really set to 256 with just ':set t_Co' inside vim in screen
