2012-03-16T20:10:00.000Z	gogasan		Hi all. There is maxima compilation problem on ./configure stage: configure: error: No lisp implementation specified and none of the default executables clisp(clisp),gcl(GCL),lisp(CMUCL),scl(SCL),sbcl(SBCL),lisp(ACL),openmcl(OpenMCL),ecl(ECL) were found in PATH
2012-03-16T20:11:00.000Z	gogasan		What should i do?
2012-03-16T20:11:00.000Z	trism	gogasan	try: sudo apt-get build-dep maxima;
2012-03-16T20:13:00.000Z	gogasan		Emm... Answer is: Unable to find source code for maxima
2012-03-16T20:14:00.000Z	trism	gogasan	ahh yeah you need to enable source repos to do that, well, maxima using gcl in the default ubuntu version, so you could install that
2012-03-16T20:15:00.000Z	trism	gogasan	or just enable the source repos in software-properties-gtk
2012-03-16T20:15:00.000Z	gogasan		Thanks...
2012-03-16T20:16:00.000Z	gogasan		Source code repositories enabled. But still not working
2012-03-16T20:18:00.000Z	trism	gogasan	you need to apt-get update after changing the repos
2012-03-16T20:18:00.000Z	gogasan	trism	i have armel architecture :D this is a big problem?
2012-03-16T20:19:00.000Z	trism	gogasan	oh possibly
2012-03-16T20:19:00.000Z	trism	gogasan	I don't know if maxima is available on armel, hmm
2012-03-16T20:19:00.000Z	trism	gogasan	in the repos anyway
2012-03-16T20:19:00.000Z	gogasan		Sure, first of all i tryed to install maxima from rep
2012-03-16T20:21:00.000Z	trism	gogasan	which ubuntu version is this? I see it built for armel on maverick+
2012-03-16T20:21:00.000Z	gogasan	trism	On some webside i googled  someone said that should to install some lisp implementations. My ver is 11.10
2012-03-16T20:23:00.000Z	trism	gogasan	on amd64/i386 it would be gcl, but it looks like gcl failed to build on armel
2012-03-16T20:23:00.000Z	gogasan		em... what is gcl? Is there no way to use gcl on almel?
2012-03-16T20:24:00.000Z	trism	gogasan	gnu common lisp
