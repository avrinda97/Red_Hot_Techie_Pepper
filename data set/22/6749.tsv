2007-05-09T06:28:00.000Z	mneptok	pushpop	you don't need sudo to login with scp/sftp
2007-05-09T06:24:00.000Z	mneptok	pushpop	how did you edit the file?
2007-05-09T06:25:00.000Z	mneptok	pushpop	how?
2007-05-09T06:25:00.000Z	mneptok	pushpop	gedit? vi? nano? what?
2007-05-09T06:25:00.000Z	mneptok	pushpop	"# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root."
2007-05-09T06:26:00.000Z	mneptok	pushpop	not nano
2007-05-09T06:27:00.000Z	mneptok	pushpop	and giving sudo to every user is a Bad Idea
2007-05-09T06:29:00.000Z	mneptok	pushpop	chown the webroot
2012-02-12T21:02:00.000Z	mneptok	pushpop	top/htop/some other system monitor
2012-02-12T21:02:00.000Z	pushpop	mneptok	yes thats how I found out it was eating cpu?
2012-02-12T21:05:00.000Z	mneptok	pushpop	and it's the gnome-shell process itself eating CPU?
2012-02-12T21:05:00.000Z	pushpop	mneptok	yes
2012-02-12T21:06:00.000Z	mneptok	pushpop	try the nvidia drivers provided in official repos, or the nouveau driver.
2012-02-12T21:07:00.000Z	pushpop	mneptok	I tried the drives in the official repos.  I had the same problem
2012-02-12T21:07:00.000Z	mneptok	pushpop	see if the open source nouveau driver exhibits the same problems
2012-02-12T21:08:00.000Z	mneptok	pushpop	mind you, i am not an nvidia user, so my experience is from textbooks.
