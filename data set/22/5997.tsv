2007-01-07T14:00:00.000Z	SHDAOW_X		Can anyone help me i have a broadcom  BCM4321 wireless card and cannot get ubuntu edgy to see it
2007-01-07T14:00:00.000Z	SHDAOW_X		i have ndiswrapper on
2007-01-07T14:00:00.000Z	SHDAOW_X		and it sees the driver and the hardware
2007-01-07T14:01:00.000Z	alecjw	SHDAOW_X	hagve you tried installing the FW and using the bcm43xx driver?
2007-01-07T14:02:00.000Z	SHDAOW_X	alecjw	what is fw?
2007-01-07T14:02:00.000Z	alecjw	SHDAOW_X	firmware
2007-01-07T14:03:00.000Z	SHDAOW_X	alecjw	no how can i do that
2007-01-07T14:04:00.000Z	alecjw	SHDAOW_X	i'll try and find the utorial. it owrked on my bcm4306. most broadcoms work with EITER ndiswrapper OR the firmware hting
2007-01-07T14:05:00.000Z	SHDAOW_X	alecjw	just for information sake its a dell laptop
2007-01-07T14:06:00.000Z	alecjw	SHDAOW_X	hmmm... that might mean something, but it workedo n my g+ (125 mbps) (but it can only do 11mbps (wireless b)) . this might haoppen to you too
2007-01-07T14:07:00.000Z	alecjw	SHDAOW_X	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185174 - good luck :)
2007-01-07T14:09:00.000Z	alecjw	SHDAOW_X	yep. :(. the driver is completely reverse engineered. but if, like me, you only use it for <=11mbps internet, it shouldnt matter,, although the range could be cut down to b's standard
2007-01-07T14:10:00.000Z	SHDAOW_X	alecjw	hm i have a 108mpbs router but for the time being working is working
2007-01-07T14:12:00.000Z	alecjw	SHDAOW_X	but rmember, unless you have a >11mbps interet connection, or you want to transfer files beteween 2 comps on the netwrok, it shoudnt make any differnece at all
2007-01-07T14:12:00.000Z	SHDAOW_X	alecjw	yeah but i transfer all the times  the thing that i am wondering is just how much distance i will lose
2007-01-07T14:13:00.000Z	SHDAOW_X	alecjw	i have heard that people have gotten 54mbps out of it
2007-01-07T14:14:00.000Z	alecjw	SHDAOW_X	well i expect that it's different for each card
2007-01-07T14:14:00.000Z	SHDAOW_X	alecjw	yeah your right did you find it?
2007-01-07T14:16:00.000Z	alecjw	SHDAOW_X	didn't i give you the link? oh sorry. thought i have it to you about 5 mins ago.  here it is: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185174& - and good luck
2007-01-07T14:16:00.000Z	SHDAOW_X	alecjw	thanks might of lost it
2007-01-07T14:19:00.000Z	alecjw	SHDAOW_X	there's not really much more to talk about now, is there
