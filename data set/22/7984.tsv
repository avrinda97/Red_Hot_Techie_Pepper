2006-05-29T07:58:00.000Z	jrsims		hey, is there an xgl install for ubuntu?
2006-05-29T07:58:00.000Z	skippy	jrsims	what is your platform
2006-05-29T07:59:00.000Z	skippy		hehe really?
2006-05-29T07:59:00.000Z	jrsims		I'm on Breezy right now/
2006-05-29T07:59:00.000Z	skippy		how cool
2006-05-29T07:59:00.000Z	skippy		i thought the Daper Drake was a dragon until i saw the silly little duck picture lol
2006-05-29T07:59:00.000Z	jrsims		so is xgl on ubuntu pretty solid, or still "edgy"?
2006-05-29T08:00:00.000Z	skippy		ok Surfnkid, that will be a firefox option most likely
2006-05-29T08:00:00.000Z	jrsims		ah, too bad
2006-05-29T08:00:00.000Z	skippy		are you using "the fox"?
2006-05-29T08:00:00.000Z	jrsims		so wait, is dapper supposed to have solid xgl?
2006-05-29T08:00:00.000Z	skippy	jrsims	no definately not
2006-05-29T08:00:00.000Z	skippy		xgl is not officially supported on dapper
2006-05-29T08:01:00.000Z	jrsims		what is dapper? just a dressed up breezy?
2006-05-29T08:01:00.000Z	skippy		no Dapper is a real redistb
2006-05-29T08:01:00.000Z	skippy		its been worked from the ground up
2006-05-29T08:01:00.000Z	skippy		it is very different to breezy
2006-05-29T08:01:00.000Z	jrsims	skippy	oh, will I have to reinstall over breezy?
2006-05-29T08:01:00.000Z	skippy	jrsims	you can upgrade if you want to
2006-05-29T08:02:00.000Z	skippy		but it can go wrong, i estimate in about 5% of cases
2006-05-29T08:02:00.000Z	skippy		so you want to be backed up 1st
2006-05-29T08:02:00.000Z	jrsims	skippy	not bad
