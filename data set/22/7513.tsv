2007-08-15T10:07:00.000Z	matjan		hi, the other day i switched the mode of my modem from bridged to routing... i had lots of trouble with my internet connection so i tried that... it seems that browsing is much better now, but at times gaim or xchat lose their connection, and azureus is fairly slow... i lost connection just now... whenever such a disconnect occurs, also torrent transfers drop to zero (in and out)... not sure yet how streams behave...
2007-08-15T10:07:00.000Z	matjan		does anyone have experience with port forwarding?
2007-08-15T10:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	matjan	maybe I can help.. what's up
2007-08-15T10:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	matjan	just read your previous post.  Is your "modem" a adsl modem?

2007-08-15T10:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	matjan	here's a pretty complete link on how to setup the modem for portforwarding based on programs. By finding the specific program or looking at other configurations you'll get the idea on how to configure.  http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Gnet/BB0060B/BB0060Bindex.htm
