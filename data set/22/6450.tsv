2008-06-03T04:57:00.000Z	JuJuBee		I have been trying to figure out why my laptop (Kubuntu) will not shut down properly if I use the GUI or "sudo shutdown now" at CLI.  I have pasted my syslog from the time I tried to turn off my computer http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/16503/ if someone wouldn't mind assisting me.
2008-06-03T04:57:00.000Z	jsestri2	JuJuBee	why does it matter?
2008-06-03T04:58:00.000Z	JuJuBee		I do not like to have to press the power key until it powers off.
2008-06-03T04:59:00.000Z	JuJuBee	jsestri2	: do you power off by pulling the plug on your computer?
2008-06-03T04:59:00.000Z	jsestri2	JuJuBee	no, but you can hold the power button to shut it off nicely
2008-06-03T05:00:00.000Z	JuJuBee	jsestri2	normally yes, but not now for some reason. The system seems to hang, hence the paste of my syslog as I don't unerstand much of it...
2008-06-03T05:01:00.000Z	JuJuBee	jsestri2	my computer screen goes blank and the fan is running but the HD led is not doing anything. I left it this way for over 20 miutes with no change.
2008-06-03T05:01:00.000Z	jsestri2	JuJuBee	shutting off the computer, i believe is done through acpi, which is notoriously buggy since it tends to vary between hardware so much...unfortunately that means shutdown is hard, reset is easy
2008-06-03T05:02:00.000Z	jsestri2	JuJuBee	you probably just have to wait until it gets fixed, unless you're experienced with the kernel, then you might be able to hack it yourself -- but even then it'd be hard
2008-06-03T05:02:00.000Z	JuJuBee	jsestri2	so what do I do? IT has been working fine for long time until I installed the AIT drivers
2008-06-03T05:02:00.000Z	JuJuBee		Not experienced
2008-06-03T05:02:00.000Z	JuJuBee		BTW still using 7.04
2008-06-03T05:03:00.000Z	jsestri2	JuJuBee	in that case its probably to do with your hdd driver, you might be best off reporting a bug
2008-06-03T05:04:00.000Z	JuJuBee		Could it be possible that it has to do with the installing of ATI proprietary drivers?  The first 2 lines of my syslog right at the time I try to shutdown deal with fglrx and an error...
2008-06-03T05:04:00.000Z	JuJuBee		That is the only thing that stands out in http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/16503/
2008-06-03T05:06:00.000Z	jsestri2	JuJuBee	it probably is because of the proprietary drivers -- if you can survive without them, revert your changes otherwise report a bug is what i'd do
2008-06-03T05:06:00.000Z	JuJuBee		How do I uninstall the AIT drivers?
2008-06-03T05:07:00.000Z	JuJuBee		I tried going through the install for the drivers provided by ubuntu as per how-to,
2008-06-03T05:07:00.000Z	JuJuBee		Not sure which ones Im using anymore
2008-06-03T05:07:00.000Z	jsestri2		Hmmm... that might be an issue, i don't happen to know those drivers, but usually the install process can be followed in reverse if you find the right parameters
2008-06-03T05:08:00.000Z	JuJuBee		and the forums are down at the moment
2008-06-03T05:12:00.000Z	JuJuBee	jsestri2	: I found the fglrx-uninstall.sh in /usr/share/ati
