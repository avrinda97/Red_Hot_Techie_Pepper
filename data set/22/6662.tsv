2006-09-03T10:10:00.000Z	btrento		I am tryin to install matlab and it is 3 disk, so when it ask for the the second disk it wil not unlock the cdrom so the disk can be inserted.  Has anyone had a similar problem or know of a solution
2006-09-03T10:11:00.000Z	ladydoor	btrento	can you manually eject either by pressing the eject button or by entering "eject"
2006-09-03T10:12:00.000Z	btrento	ladydoor	It will not let me manuall eject.
2006-09-03T10:14:00.000Z	ladydoor	btrento	try "sudo eject." and did "eject" give you an error?
2006-09-03T10:14:00.000Z	btrento	ladydoor	Yes it will not let me eject until i close the terminal that i am running the install script in
2006-09-03T10:15:00.000Z	ladydoor	btrento	hmm. that's odd. sorry, i've got nothing more for you
2006-09-03T10:16:00.000Z	btrento	ladydoor	 Do you know of anyway to release a executable from a shell?
2006-09-03T10:16:00.000Z	ladydoor	btrento	control-c
2006-09-03T10:16:00.000Z	ladydoor	btrento	will forcibly kill it
2006-09-03T10:18:00.000Z	btrento	ladydoor	 I do not want to kill it i just want the script to run not in the terminal
2006-09-03T10:18:00.000Z	ladydoor	btrento	you want it to run in the background, then?
2006-09-03T10:18:00.000Z	btrento	ladydoor	 exactly
2006-09-03T10:19:00.000Z	btrento	ladydoor	thanks for your help
2006-09-03T10:20:00.000Z	ladydoor	btrento	i hope it actually helped
2006-09-03T10:25:00.000Z	btrento	ladydoor	That did not work either, but when i try to eject or sudo eject is just says device is busy
2006-09-03T10:25:00.000Z	ladydoor	btrento	ahhh...hm. is this a native port of matlab?
2006-09-03T10:26:00.000Z	btrento	ladydoor	yes
2006-09-03T10:26:00.000Z	ladydoor	btrento	yeah...sorry, i don't know
2006-09-03T10:28:00.000Z	btrento	ladydoor	I guess i will search matlabs forums for a solution or call them? but thanks for all your help
2006-09-03T10:28:00.000Z	ladydoor	btrento	sorry it didn't help. good luck.
