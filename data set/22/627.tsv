2011-06-11T08:33:00.000Z	Arroyo1010		Hello. I have just finished upgrading Ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04 via the updater. After the reboot Ubuntu hangs on  logo. I tried restarting the VM, and the same happens. Hang on Ubuntu logo
2011-06-11T08:33:00.000Z	Arroyo1010		I am not a linux noob, I just need a good pointer in which direction to go now, what to troubleshoot first, and how
2011-06-11T08:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arroyo1010	on the grub2 screen (hold shift if you don't see it) use "e" to edit the boot line - and try removing "quite splash" and/or try "nomodeset" - then i think ctrl+x to boot (but not 100% sure on that, it says what to use to boot)
2011-06-11T08:35:00.000Z	Arroyo1010	ZykoticK9	will try now. bazhang  because i'm trying to see how reliable is updating via updater :)
2011-06-11T08:38:00.000Z	Arroyo1010	ZykoticK9	How do i save my edit in this grub editor?
2011-06-11T08:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arroyo1010	you cant
2011-06-11T08:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arroyo1010	edit /etc/default/grub when you've booted.  Use ctrl+x (or something?) to boot.
2011-06-11T08:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arroyo1010	right and after you've edited i think is says at the bottom ctrl+x to boot (but i could be wrong)
2011-06-11T08:43:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arroyo1010	give "nomodeset" a try.
2011-06-11T08:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arroyo1010	is this a VM?
2011-06-11T08:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arroyo1010	doubt nomodeset is you issue then.
2011-06-11T08:45:00.000Z	Arroyo1010	ZykoticK9	, yes, same thing happened :)
2011-06-11T08:46:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arroyo1010	TBH upgrading and ubuntu often results in breakages.  Many experienced Ubuntu users will recommend fresh installs over upgrades (obviously some will disagree).
2011-06-11T08:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arroyo1010	you're very welcome.  Hope you figure it out!  Good luck.
2011-06-11T08:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arroyo1010	minimal - it's basically just the debian installer, with Ubuntu repositories (you even get debian wallpaper)
2011-06-11T08:53:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arroyo1010	if you want "Gnome" do NOT use the gnome package, use gnome-desktop-environment ("gnome" won't work BTW)
2011-06-11T08:53:00.000Z	Arroyo1010	ZykoticK9	thank you for the tip. I will download it now and try it
2011-06-11T08:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arroyo1010	be careful - minimal is what led me away from Ubuntu ;)
2011-06-11T08:54:00.000Z	Arroyo1010	ZykoticK9	what distro are you using now ?
2011-06-11T08:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arroyo1010	debian
2011-06-11T08:54:00.000Z	Arroyo1010	ZykoticK9	ah. It's too plain vanilla for me :D
2011-06-11T09:28:00.000Z	Arroyo1010	ZykoticK9	i just went with the default unity install. I'm off to bed now. see you later ppls :p
