2007-06-04T15:59:00.000Z	anathematic		i've got a few partitions on my computer formatted as the ext3 stuff, i'm not going to have any problems with windows using the data on them am i?
2007-06-04T16:00:00.000Z	Catoptromancy	anathematic	I dont think windows can even read that
2007-06-04T16:00:00.000Z	anathematic	Catoptromancy	 any idea what to do then? I've got a heap of data on my ext3 partitions and i'm going back to windows
2007-06-04T16:00:00.000Z	anathematic		=\
2007-06-04T16:00:00.000Z	Catoptromancy	anathematic	not dual booting?
2007-06-04T16:01:00.000Z	anathematic	Catoptromancy	no going back to windows completely just too many problems
2007-06-04T16:01:00.000Z	Catoptromancy		= (
2007-06-04T16:01:00.000Z	anathematic		just problem after problem after problem =(
2007-06-04T16:01:00.000Z	anathematic		so i'll just have to move a load of data around and format it as NTFS on ubuntu now before i go back Catoptromancy?
2007-06-04T16:02:00.000Z	Catoptromancy	anathematic	do you have enough free space to move all the files to one partition?
2007-06-04T16:02:00.000Z	anathematic	Catoptromancy	yeah luckily because i slipped and formatted a 400gig the other day lol
2007-06-04T16:02:00.000Z	anathematic		bah linux was a pain in the ass right to the end it seems
2007-06-04T16:03:00.000Z	Catoptromancy	anathematic	put all your files on one partiton, and format the empty partiton as FAT32
2007-06-04T16:03:00.000Z	Catoptromancy	anathematic	I would rather suggest using something external, a HD or DVDs
2007-06-04T16:04:00.000Z	anathematic	Catoptromancy	=) that's the plan now
2007-06-04T16:04:00.000Z	anathematic		although i'd rather ubuntu just not suck for me lol
2007-06-04T16:04:00.000Z	anathematic		or for me to suck at ubuntu?
2007-06-04T16:04:00.000Z	Catoptromancy	anathematic	Linux and windows read FAT32 fine, so all your files wil be on the FAT32
2007-06-04T16:05:00.000Z	Catoptromancy	anathematic	reinstall windows move them to the ntfs and reformat the FAT32 to ntfs, or leave it as FAT32
2007-06-04T16:05:00.000Z	anathematic	Catoptromancy	yeah i'll just do that
2007-06-04T16:06:00.000Z	anathematic		farewell #ubuntu, guess i'll come back in a while when i feel like unlimited patience for things like changing my damn harddrive name lol
2007-06-04T16:06:00.000Z	Catoptromancy	anathematic	works great for a dual boot, I access all my files from Windows or Linux, only apps on on the main partition
