2007-09-05T05:38:00.000Z	Timbooooo	Pelo	trying to run live cd, just get into ubuntu
2007-09-05T05:38:00.000Z	Pelo	Timbooooo	you might want to give the alternate install cd a try, it is text based,
2007-09-05T05:39:00.000Z	Timbooooo	Pelo	i want to try live cd first, can i do text install for live run?
2007-09-05T05:40:00.000Z	Pelo	Timbooooo	not realy,   I suspect you have either a nvidia or ati video card which is causing the problem , you can'T run the live cd with those
2007-09-05T05:41:00.000Z	Pelo	Timbooooo	I'm a linux user , I don'T trust windows ;-)
2007-09-05T05:41:00.000Z	Pelo	Timbooooo	but if you are having difficulties with the live cd the only other option is the altcd
