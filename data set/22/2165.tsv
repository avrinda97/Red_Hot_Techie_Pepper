2009-09-08T00:24:00.000Z	Guest2717		I've just installed ubuntu in windows, inside my laptop. Do i need to install additional stuff to make wireless working???
2009-09-08T00:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest2717	inside Windows hmm?
2009-09-08T00:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest2717	You mean Wubi?
2009-09-08T00:25:00.000Z	Guest2717	sebsebseb	yea is that a good idea?
2009-09-08T00:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest2717	no it isn't a good idea
2009-09-08T00:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest2717	  People can get weird issues with Wubi, also since it's running inside Windows, it won't run as well as a proper Ubuntu install etc
2009-09-08T00:25:00.000Z	Guest2717	sebsebseb	how come?
2009-09-08T00:26:00.000Z	Guest2717	sebsebseb	then i should go back to xp and uninstall wubi
2009-09-08T00:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest2717	better to do real partitions,   but if Wubi is working for you,  maybe keep it for now to try Ubuntu,  and then put  9.10  on when it's released, with nice default rather fast to bootup  Ext4 file system by default :)
2009-09-08T00:28:00.000Z	Guest2717	sebsebseb	does wubi clean out 100% itself when i uninstall?
2009-09-08T00:28:00.000Z	Guest2717		dragon rite now i'm updating ubuntu so i have to wait
2009-09-08T00:29:00.000Z	Guest2717		Does ext4 works for old hd for laptop
2009-09-08T00:29:00.000Z	Guest2717		For example Dell inspiron 1501
2009-09-08T00:31:00.000Z	Guest2717		once ubuntu 9.10 verison comes out do we have to format hard drive again? example if i have ext3 would i need to format it to ext4???
2009-09-08T00:32:00.000Z	Guest2717		I assume yes.
2009-09-08T00:34:00.000Z	Guest2717		Does anyone know how to setup the new partation for 9.04 is ext4 (4gb?) /home (4gb?) and /swap (2gb?)
2009-09-08T00:35:00.000Z	Guest2717		dragon to setup the new partation for 9.04 is ext4 (4gb?) /home (4gb?) and /swap (2gb?)
2009-09-08T00:35:00.000Z	Guest2717		sebsebseb:
2009-09-08T00:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest2717	uhmm
2009-09-08T00:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest2717	Ext4  can still be a little dodgy in  Ubuntu 9.04, because they do not have a proper kernel for it
2009-09-08T00:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest2717	9.10 will have though
2009-09-08T00:38:00.000Z	Guest2717	sebsebseb	if i'm on laptop and on a slow one what cmds or settings i need to set  too?
