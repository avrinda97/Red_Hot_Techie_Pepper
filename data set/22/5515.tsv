2010-02-18T13:56:00.000Z	shashank	ionut	I see 'cups-insecure-printer'
2010-02-18T13:57:00.000Z	shashank	ionut	Yeah the printer is installed well.
2010-02-18T13:57:00.000Z	shashank	ionut	what I did was:
2010-02-18T13:57:00.000Z	shashank	ionut	After getting the error I removed the printer
2010-02-18T13:57:00.000Z	shashank	ionut	and reinstalled it.
2010-02-18T13:57:00.000Z	shashank	ionut	This I did using the terminal.
2010-02-18T13:57:00.000Z	ionut	shashank	what printer u have ?
2010-02-18T13:58:00.000Z	shashank	ionut	cups-pdf
2010-02-18T13:58:00.000Z	shashank	ionut	wait I am on it.
2010-02-18T13:59:00.000Z	shashank	ionut	I executed the command you typed, but it yields no result in the terminal.
2010-02-18T13:59:00.000Z	shashank	ionut	What do you think may be the problem?
2010-02-18T13:59:00.000Z	ionut		i think there are some problems with permissions. u have to find anything in /usr/lib/cups/filter  and /usr/lib/cups/backend which are not owned by the root and chown and chgrp them to root ?
2010-02-18T14:00:00.000Z	shashank	ionut	roger that.
2010-02-18T14:01:00.000Z	ionut	shashank	try to run this commands sudo chown -hR /usr/lib/cups/filter , sudo chown -hR /usr/lib/cups/backend , sudo chgrp -hR /usr/lib/cups/filter , sudo chgrp -hR /usr/lib/cups/backend
2010-02-18T14:02:00.000Z	ionut	shashank	sorry , u must add root between all for eg.   sudo chown -hR root /usr/libs/cups/filter
