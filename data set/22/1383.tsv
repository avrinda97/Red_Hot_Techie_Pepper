2010-06-01T08:09:00.000Z	edbian	phoenix___	Do you have a problem?  I'd love to help with it!
2010-06-01T08:10:00.000Z	phoenix___	edbian	ya, i am trying to run yahoo messenger in wine, done some tweaks and successfully loged
2010-06-01T08:10:00.000Z	edbian	phoenix___	That's not a problem ;)
2010-06-01T08:10:00.000Z	phoenix___	edbian	wait
2010-06-01T08:24:00.000Z	phoenix___	edbian	is there any channel for empathy
2010-06-01T08:11:00.000Z	phoenix___	edbian	i am able to browse the rooms list and select on upon entering chat, at the time of showing the captcha, it hangs, i have the backtrace of wine, could you help me
2010-06-01T08:12:00.000Z	edbian	phoenix___	I don't think I would be able to offer any help.  That's pretty deep stuff I'd have to research it for about a week first.  MY first inclination is to suggest that you try empathy or pidgin.  They can chat on the yahoo network among many others seamlessly
2010-06-01T08:14:00.000Z	phoenix___	edbian	i like gyachi very much except that , its fonts are ugly. about pidgin and empathy, in empathy i am not able to get the rooms list for yahoo and in both messengers voice chating is not possible

2010-06-01T08:23:00.000Z	edbian	phoenix___	Yes
2010-06-01T08:23:00.000Z	edbian	phoenix___	Why?
2010-06-01T08:23:00.000Z	phoenix___	edbian	in empathy, i am not able to access the chat rooms list
2010-06-01T08:24:00.000Z	edbian	phoenix___	I have no idea.  I don't use yahoo so I've never investigated it. :)
2010-06-01T08:25:00.000Z	edbian	phoenix___	No, there is the developer mailing list but I don't know if that's the place for tech support.  This is the best channel.  I'm just not the best person for you :)
2010-06-01T08:26:00.000Z	phoenix___	edbian	ok
