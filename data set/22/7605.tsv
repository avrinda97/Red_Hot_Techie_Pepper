2006-02-28T07:54:00.000Z	roostishaw		can you reverse the changes made by automatrix?
2006-02-28T07:54:00.000Z	roostishaw		anyone?
2006-02-28T07:54:00.000Z	_jason	roostishaw	you probably need to read the source and see what it did
2006-02-28T07:55:00.000Z	roostishaw	_jason	you mean my sources.list?
2006-02-28T07:55:00.000Z	_jason	roostishaw	no, the source for automatix.  It's just a bash script iirc
2006-03-02T13:45:00.000Z	_jason	roostishaw	might want to put -R after chown too
2006-03-02T13:46:00.000Z	roostishaw	_jason	what does -R do?
2006-03-02T13:47:00.000Z	_jason	roostishaw	recursive, but I guess you don't need it if you are deleting inside the .Trash really
2006-03-02T13:49:00.000Z	_jason	roostishaw	sudo chown roostishaw:roostishaw ~/.Trash
2006-03-02T13:49:00.000Z	roostishaw	_jason	thanks, it worked!
2006-04-07T13:05:00.000Z	_jason	roostishaw	you don't need firestarter running to have your firewall on
2006-04-07T13:05:00.000Z	roostishaw	_jason	iknow, but i like to know when people try to connect
2006-04-07T13:05:00.000Z	_jason	roostishaw	did you set it up so sudo doesn't ask you for a password when you run firestarter?
2006-04-07T13:06:00.000Z	roostishaw	_jason	if you mean on startup... thats what im asking how to do
2006-04-07T13:07:00.000Z	_jason	roostishaw	I mean if you run 'gksudo firestarter' does it ask you for a password?
2006-04-07T13:07:00.000Z	roostishaw	_jason	no it dosn't... btw, im running dapper
