2010-01-31T10:56:00.000Z	sargento		dublue2, have you tried just typing the command without parameters to see if it is installed or not?
2010-01-31T10:57:00.000Z	dublued2	sargento	 it says command not found and recommends for me to install ndiswrapper-common.  but it shows that it's installed in synaptic
2010-01-31T10:59:00.000Z	sargento	dublued2	it is happenning with other commands as well, for example, firefox?
2010-01-31T11:00:00.000Z	dublued2	sargento	 no, other commands work fine
2010-01-31T11:02:00.000Z	sargento	dublued2	which distro are you using?
2010-01-31T11:03:00.000Z	dublued2	sargento	 karmic 9.10... i think i figured it out... i may not have build-essential installed... checking that now
2010-01-31T11:03:00.000Z	sargento	dublued2	Ok, please let us know about it
2010-01-31T11:03:00.000Z	dublued2	sargento	 it was isntalled, so i guess that wasn't it

2010-01-31T11:05:00.000Z	sargento	dublued2	Have you tried Ubuntu Software Center?
2010-01-31T11:05:00.000Z	dublued2	sargento	 it shows it as installed
2010-01-31T11:06:00.000Z	sargento	dublued2	why don't you uninstall and install again?
2010-01-31T11:07:00.000Z	dublued2	sargento	 i have tried that, but will do it again.  let's see what happens
2010-01-31T11:07:00.000Z	sargento	dublued2	Ok, I wait here, thanks
2010-01-31T11:09:00.000Z	dublued2	sargento	 shold i restart after installing before i reinstall?
2010-01-31T11:09:00.000Z	sargento	dublued2	I'm not quite sure but in Linux you don't supposed to, is not Win-does
2010-01-31T11:09:00.000Z	dublued2	sargento	 reinstalling it worked
2010-01-31T11:10:00.000Z	sargento	dublued2	excellent, congratulations!
2010-01-31T11:10:00.000Z	dublued2	sargento	 thanks for the help.  unfortunately that doesn't fix my problem of trying to install a mini pci dell 1390 wireless card
2010-01-31T11:11:00.000Z	sargento	dublued2	Did you look for it on the compatible list?
2010-01-31T11:12:00.000Z	dublued2	sargento	 yes i will look into that, thank you.  i will reboot now.
2010-01-31T11:13:00.000Z	sargento	dublued2	no problem, hope it works for you.
