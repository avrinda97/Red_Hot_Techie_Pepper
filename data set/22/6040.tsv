2007-01-02T15:06:00.000Z	phr34ck		hey is there a book about Linux and includes ubuntu as well?
2007-01-02T15:06:00.000Z	Flannel	phr34ck	there are ubuntu books
2007-01-02T15:07:00.000Z	phr34ck	Flannel	guide my way.
2007-01-02T15:08:00.000Z	Flannel	phr34ck	http://www.ubuntu.com/news/Official_Ubuntu_Book  there are others, of course
2007-01-02T15:08:00.000Z	phr34ck	Flannel	thanks.
2007-01-02T15:09:00.000Z	Flannel	phr34ck	that's useful for learning abut how to do stuff with ubuntu, if you want a book about linux in general, down to the nitty gritty, there are linux books out there (there's also a good deal of stuff online)
2007-01-03T13:26:00.000Z	Flannel	phr34ck	how did you install the old version?
2007-01-03T13:26:00.000Z	phr34ck	Flannel	I downloaded it manually ...
2007-01-03T13:26:00.000Z	Flannel	phr34ck	right, but downloaded what? a deb? a bin?
2007-01-03T13:27:00.000Z	phr34ck	Flannel	I think deb ... I can't remember. Is there a way to find out ?
2007-01-03T13:27:00.000Z	Flannel	phr34ck	dpkg -l  will list all the packages you have installed.  um, depending on what the package name was: dpkg -l | grep jre or mayvbe dpkg -l | grep java
2007-01-03T13:30:00.000Z	Flannel	phr34ck	if you installed it from a bin, then it's been strewn all around your system (to where everything is supposed to go), it's exactly like installing from source.  If it's a deb, then you can remove it cleanly with normal package management
2007-01-03T13:30:00.000Z	phr34ck	Flannel	thanks man.
2007-01-03T13:34:00.000Z	Flannel	phr34ck	automatix is not safe, and definately not official.
2007-01-03T13:34:00.000Z	phr34ck	Flannel	how so?
2007-01-03T13:35:00.000Z	Flannel	phr34ck	when it breaks, it does so beyond repair
2007-01-05T16:11:00.000Z	Flannel	phr34ck	##C++ is a good one
2007-01-05T16:15:00.000Z	Flannel	phr34ck	no.  if you want that, your best bet may be #ubuntu-offtopic, or if there's a specific team channel you're looking for, that one.
2007-01-08T15:58:00.000Z	Flannel	phr34ck	what do you mean?  Like all the packages that make up ubuntu?
2007-01-08T15:58:00.000Z	phr34ck	Flannel	no.
2007-01-08T15:59:00.000Z	Flannel	phr34ck	yeah, Linux is linux.  So any "this is how linux works" article on the web will tell you.
2007-01-09T17:50:00.000Z	Flannel	phr34ck	it holds things of varying size : http://www.secguru.com/files/cheatsheet/linux-file-structure.jpg
