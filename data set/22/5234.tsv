2007-07-13T05:46:00.000Z	unagi		gdm restart doesnt help because its not restarting x server

2007-07-13T05:47:00.000Z	unagi		yup
2007-07-13T05:47:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	unagi	won't sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart do it?
2007-07-13T08:36:00.000Z	unagi	nerdygirl_ellie	its so annoying that this seems like an easy problem to fix
2007-07-13T08:36:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	unagi	I know you tried /etc/init.d/gdm stop.  what else?
2007-07-13T08:37:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	unagi	anything else I should know?
2007-07-13T08:38:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	unagi	I think it's that your script doesn't have the correct environment variables to restart the x session.
2007-07-13T08:39:00.000Z	unagi	nerdygirl_ellie	thats a great hypothesis but even if i run it from the command prompt
2007-07-13T09:10:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	unagi	 I !think! imagemagick can do it, and I know mencoder can.
2007-07-13T09:11:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	unagi	yes, it reads a movie in and outputs it however you say, in this case to a metric assload of jpgs.
2007-07-13T09:12:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	unagi	it's part of the mplayer package on Redhat, I assume it is the same on Ubuntu
2007-07-13T09:14:00.000Z	unagi	nerdygirl_ellie	do you know how to use mencoder?
2007-07-13T09:14:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	unagi	I have to futz with it every time.
2007-07-13T09:17:00.000Z	unagi	nerdygirl_ellie	can you give me an example of the command line its looking for
2007-07-13T09:25:00.000Z	unagi	nerdygirl_ellie	 can u give me an example of the command its looking for?
2007-07-13T09:26:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	unagi	?
