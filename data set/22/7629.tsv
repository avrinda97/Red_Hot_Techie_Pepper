2006-02-21T11:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	farous	Whoa.  I need to spend more time on the ThinkWiki site.  There's all kinds of stuff there!
2006-02-25T17:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	farous	apt-cache show lyx.  Gives a listserv instead of a personal address.
2006-03-08T15:36:00.000Z	farous	tonyyarusso	i have no idea am just a user
2006-03-08T15:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	farous	'k.
2006-03-08T16:50:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	farous	Commas?
2006-03-08T16:50:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	farous	Quotation marks, you mean?
2006-03-08T16:51:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	farous	Totally understandable.  I wish I could do the same.  Darn psych...
2006-03-14T12:04:00.000Z	farous	tonyyarusso	why not just built a guest account for whoever gonna use your pc
2006-03-14T12:05:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	farous	I'm considering that.  Or maybe creating another user to own those files, and still let people use this one to save the hassle of logging out/in.
2006-03-14T12:05:00.000Z	farous	tonyyarusso	having a seperate account for guest is good idea. for you will be able to restrict them and restrict ava resources to them. You do not want them messing your config
2006-03-14T12:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	farous	Good point.  Any guides for how to restrict things to exactly what you want available?
2006-03-14T12:07:00.000Z	farous	tonyyarusso	i just use gnome add user. And then work from there
2006-03-14T12:07:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	farous	'k.
2006-04-11T12:56:00.000Z	farous	tonyyarusso	did you check thinkwiki
2006-04-11T12:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	farous	I'm pulling that up now actually.
2006-06-25T15:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	farous	I guess that's what the one project was for - Portland?
2006-06-25T15:28:00.000Z	farous	tonyyarusso	portland? I guess i still need to read more :)
2006-06-25T15:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	farous	I'm not sure of the name - it's a recently launched effort to make KDE and Gnome more compatible.
2006-06-25T15:30:00.000Z	farous	tonyyarusso	yah that would be great. rather then have gnomerc when using kde or kderc when using gnome
2006-10-18T12:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	farous	Ask every once in a while in #ubuntu-offtopic (that's where we handle the great-community-but-not-support... kind of stuff)
2006-10-18T12:15:00.000Z	farous	tonyyarusso	fair enough
