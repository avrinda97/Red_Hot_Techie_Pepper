2011-05-01T06:34:00.000Z	Datz		just remove
2011-05-01T06:35:00.000Z	Datz		Although it doesn't want to let me remove unity without removing ubuntu-desktop
2011-05-01T06:35:00.000Z	Datz		damn..
2011-05-01T06:35:00.000Z	KM0201	Datz	i believe thats just a meta package.. you'll see a lot of packages remove that
2011-05-01T06:36:00.000Z	Datz	KM0201	is there a minimal gnome2 desktop?
2011-05-01T06:36:00.000Z	Datz		package
2011-05-01T06:36:00.000Z	Datz	KM0201	nevermind, I'll search
2011-05-01T06:36:00.000Z	KM0201	Datz	if you're using 11.04, it should be installed by default, log out, at sign on screen, clcik your username then click "Sessions" and set it to Gnome classic
2011-05-01T06:37:00.000Z	Datz	KM0201	yea, but I want it gone :P
2011-05-01T06:37:00.000Z	KM0201		you want what gone? unity?.. so uninstall it.. thats no tgonna effect gnome
2011-05-01T06:37:00.000Z	Datz	KM0201	there is freezing, and I have to boot to safe mode
2011-05-01T06:37:00.000Z	Datz	KM0201	there is some driver issue
2011-05-01T06:37:00.000Z	Datz	KM0201	I'm not going to be able to run unity here
2011-05-01T06:38:00.000Z	KM0201	Datz	ok.. so don't run it?
2011-05-01T06:38:00.000Z	Datz	KM0201	so I'm going to remove it
2011-05-01T06:38:00.000Z	KM0201	Datz	ok, if thats what you want to do.
2011-05-01T06:38:00.000Z	Datz		tis
2011-05-01T06:38:00.000Z	KM0201	Datz	the other option is to install one of the "lighter" desktops.. depending on the specs of your machine.. xfce or lxde
2011-05-01T06:39:00.000Z	Datz	KM0201	well it's a VM, so no unity, but gnome2 without unity works fine
2011-05-01T06:39:00.000Z	Datz		I guess I could probably run unity but ..eh
2011-05-01T06:39:00.000Z	KM0201	Datz	ok, well thaen thats your answer
