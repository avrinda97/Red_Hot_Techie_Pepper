2008-05-04T02:46:00.000Z	blankhead		hello im using a remote terminal client...when i transmission whatever.torrent on the client pc it downloads via transmission however on the remote terminal it says **message: cannot open display: anyone know how i could have my pc download it via transmission via my remote terminal
2008-05-04T02:47:00.000Z	gord_	blankhead	what OS are u using locally?
2008-05-04T02:48:00.000Z	gord_	blankhead	aha, hmmmm, err, gord steps back looking lost   :)
2008-05-04T02:55:00.000Z	gord_	blankhead	well, i think i get you, u want a BT clint for your fone, but i think its best to just down-torrent it to the PC then SSH it across to the fone, using scp or sftp etc
2008-05-04T02:56:00.000Z	blankhead	gord_	nah i dont want a bt client for my phone...i just want to give the command to my pc to start downloading it for itself and check out the process and stuff when i get home
2008-05-04T02:58:00.000Z	gord_	blankhead	aha i get u now, hmm, yeah u need a commandline BT client, i dunno of transmission does that, and farankly, i've nevery used a cli-client (i a noob lol)
2008-05-04T02:59:00.000Z	blankhead	gord_	yeah basicaly a commandline bt that will download it..i wanna use transmission cuz its quite fast and im hoping i could get it to work but if not then ill use whatever bt works on the commandline just name it if u know any or if anyone else knows please share
2008-05-04T03:00:00.000Z	gord_	blankhead	 just "man transmission", seems like it will do CLI usage ok
2008-05-04T03:01:00.000Z	blankhead	gord_	what do u mean extactly? should i just type man transmission mytorrent.torrent???
2008-05-04T03:01:00.000Z	gord_	blankhead	nope, open a terminal type "man transmission" to get the MANual page for transmission, it tell u there
2008-05-04T03:02:00.000Z	blankhead	gord_	oooh thank u then
2008-05-04T03:03:00.000Z	gord_	blankhead	or like genii says, install rtorrent for ncurses (pretty-text-mode-look) display over ssh
2008-05-04T03:32:00.000Z	gord_	blankhead	yeah the -X option will eXport the applications X-window to your end of the SSH connection, and open it locally on your display, BUT i know you're using a fone right? mayeb won't work if no X-windows system on the fone end
2008-05-04T03:33:00.000Z	blankhead	gord_	thats right i used rtorrent which works good but the problem is is that its dependent on my remote terminal...so if i close this remote terminal it cancels the download all together i rather have the pc do all the work so even if i close my remote terminal and such i still can come home and watch it download
2008-05-04T03:34:00.000Z	blankhead	gord_	 i just want the program to do all the work...say i wanna close xchat or rhythmbox from my terminal i can
2008-05-04T03:35:00.000Z	gord_	blankhead	haha no probs, u just need to add a nohup to the commandline to start the program, so it doesnt stop when u droip the ssh terminal
2008-05-04T03:35:00.000Z	gord_	blankhead	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup
2008-05-04T03:37:00.000Z	blankhead	gord_	thanks gord but im just wondering...this will give me the ability to open programs and close them and have them display on the pc im tapping into? u know what i mean...like if i tap limewire from my remote terminal and im looking at my pc willl i see limewire pop up?
2008-05-04T03:38:00.000Z	gord_	blankhead	quite frankly i dont know, i never do that myself, i'd say no,u wont see the prog's window at the PC head end,  but i'd probably be wrong :) needs a try
2008-05-04T03:41:00.000Z	gord_	blankhead	its acually     ssh -X     x in uppercase, in *nix case matters a lot!
2008-05-04T03:47:00.000Z	gord_	blankhead	in a similar theme, google for  vnc and X11vnc. vnc opens a new "display" whereas X11VNC opens the _existing_ desktop display, althoug requires extra work to do so. Much easier with ssh -X, one at a time ;)
2008-05-04T03:50:00.000Z	blankhead	gord_	thanks for that information and helping this noobie get in touch with the power of linux
