2005-08-31T14:38:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		hmm, it says to me "hardware change, bla" and it gives the Safe Mode, Safe Mode with command prompt, reboot with last known good config settings page, ya'll know the one. anyone ever had that?
2005-08-31T14:39:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		oh and i found the way to remove a broken OS from the boot menu if anyone wants to know, ask me and i will tell ^^
2005-08-31T06:35:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		does anyone know why when i install ubuntu and kubuntu on the same pc, same versions and same settings, ubuntu reads "Buffer I/O Error on device HDC"?
2005-08-31T06:36:00.000Z	Seveas	ThePyromaniac	take the cd out before rebooting :)
2005-08-31T06:38:00.000Z	Seveas	ThePyromaniac	do you have an installed system and are you trying to install extra packages or is this during installation of Ubuntu?
2005-09-11T15:34:00.000Z	Seveas	ThePyromaniac	simply install windows XP (it will ask which partition to use) and restore grub afterwards to boot into linux again
2005-09-21T06:44:00.000Z	Seveas	ThePyromaniac	then file a bug..

2005-09-27T16:01:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac	Seveas	i installed the package you mentions, it instaleld a few with it. it still says that iostream: No such file or directory
2005-09-27T16:02:00.000Z	Seveas	ThePyromaniac	then either your code is bad or you're compiling it the wrong way :)
