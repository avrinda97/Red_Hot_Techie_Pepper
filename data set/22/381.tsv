2011-11-08T03:04:00.000Z	zacarias		when trying to install libldap2-dev with Synaptic, it says   "Depends: libldap-2.4-2 (=2.4.23-0ubuntu3.5) but 2.4.23-0ubuntu3.6 is to be installed". However, it's installed!
2011-11-08T03:05:00.000Z	EvilResistance	zacarias	 there's an upgrade that supercedes 2.4.23-0ubuntu3.5
2011-11-08T03:05:00.000Z	EvilResistance	zacarias	 i.e. the latest is 2.4.23-0ubuntu3.6 therefore the package manager is installing that
2011-11-08T03:06:00.000Z	zacarias	EvilResistance	but synaptic shows that I have 2.4.23-0ubuntu3.6
2011-11-08T03:07:00.000Z	EvilResistance	zacarias	 ***READ*** the statements
2011-11-08T03:07:00.000Z	zacarias		EvilResistance:?
2011-11-08T03:07:00.000Z	EvilResistance	zacarias	 "Depends: libldap-2.4-2 (=2.4.23-0ubuntu3.5)"  Is 2.4.23-0ubuntu3.5 equal to 2.4.23-0ubuntu3.6
2011-11-08T03:07:00.000Z	EvilResistance		?
2011-11-08T03:08:00.000Z	zacarias	EvilResistance	so I should downgrade it?
2011-11-08T03:09:00.000Z	EvilResistance	zacarias	 either that or not use what you're trying to install.
2011-11-08T03:09:00.000Z	EvilResistance	zacarias	 or file a bug against what you're trying to install saying they should update their package(s)
2011-11-08T03:09:00.000Z	EvilResistance	zacarias	 i rarely recommend downgrading anything
2011-11-08T03:09:00.000Z	EvilResistance	zacarias	 what package are you trying to install?
2011-11-08T03:09:00.000Z	zacarias	EvilResistance	it's Libreoffice. How can I downgrade it?
2011-11-08T03:10:00.000Z	EvilResistance	zacarias	 that should have already been installed *runs tests*  what distro?  11.04, 11.10?
2011-11-08T03:11:00.000Z	zacarias	EvilResistance	I have 10.10 on powerpc. 11.04 is slow and 11.10 has booting problems
2011-11-08T03:11:00.000Z	EvilResistance	zacarias	 ah.
2011-11-08T03:11:00.000Z	EvilResistance	zacarias	 i'm not sure i'll be able to assist - i'm on 11.04 + KDE
2011-11-08T03:11:00.000Z	EvilResistance		:/
2011-11-08T03:11:00.000Z	EvilResistance	zacarias	 but you now know the issue
2011-11-08T03:12:00.000Z	zacarias	EvilResistance	sure. So it's impossible to install libreoffice on 10.10?
2011-11-08T03:17:00.000Z	zacarias	EvilResistance	Thanks, anyway.
