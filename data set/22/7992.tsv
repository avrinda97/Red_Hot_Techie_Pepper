2007-10-07T16:24:00.000Z	kernel_geek		yes
2007-10-07T16:24:00.000Z	kernel_geek		change it back to nv
2007-10-07T16:24:00.000Z	kernel_geek		You cant do installer on nvidia
2007-10-07T16:24:00.000Z	rhalff	kernel_geek	why not ?
2007-10-07T16:25:00.000Z	rhalff	kernel_geek	well it just loaded so I guess there is.
2007-10-07T16:25:00.000Z	rhalff	kernel_geek	and nv doesn't work for me
2007-10-07T16:25:00.000Z	rhalff	kernel_geek	yes for the beta installer
2007-10-07T16:26:00.000Z	rhalff	kernel_geek	I think because I have a 22Inch lcd and the nv can't do that resolution but the nvidia driver can
2007-10-07T16:27:00.000Z	rhalff	kernel_geek	well ok the resolution that comes with a 22Inch :p
2007-10-07T16:28:00.000Z	rhalff	kernel_geek	anyways, gimme the magic command to continue setup! :-`d
2007-10-07T16:29:00.000Z	rhalff	kernel_geek	problem is, X isn't active anymore, and I need a command to get going again, startx won't do it, so I'm searching for something like continue_setup or something
2007-10-07T16:30:00.000Z	rhalff	kernel_geek	hm ok, the kernel driver is loaded of nvidia, but there ain't no X driver, so you're correct.
2007-10-07T16:31:00.000Z	rhalff	kernel_geek	but X is useless, I want to continue setup..
2007-10-07T16:34:00.000Z	rhalff	kernel_geek	yes X is fixed, but I'm installing, X failed during install, so I went to a console and changed the x driver, now to vesa, which works. So I'm still at the console and now I want to continue installation, I'm at the step where X loads for the first time, so I want to restart that process so I can continue the installation of  Gutsy, just running X or startx won't start that process.
2007-10-07T16:35:00.000Z	rhalff	kernel_geek	ah ok
