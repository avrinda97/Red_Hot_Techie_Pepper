2008-05-01T06:41:00.000Z	Behfar	amenado	i have the ISO and i boot to it and when i choose INSTALL UBUNTU it just takes me to a CLI prompt with a $ sign, what do i type
2008-05-01T06:42:00.000Z	amenado		Behfar-> before we get into the install process, you tried the liveCD and familiarized yourself with ubuntu? ie tried the different features?
2008-05-01T06:43:00.000Z	Behfar	amenado	i have the LIVECD i think... i got the download from the website, and i boot to it and it asks what i want to do and i say INSTALL UBUNTU and it just takes me to a prompt that says ubuntu@ubuntu:~$
2008-05-01T06:44:00.000Z	amenado		Behfar-> can you check which one you downloaded? the first menu kind of give you a clue, look around it?
2008-05-01T06:45:00.000Z	Behfar		AMENADO - ubunto 8.04 build 20080423
2008-05-01T06:46:00.000Z	Behfar		AMENADO, my choices are "try ubuntu without change on comp, install ubuntu, check cd for defects, test mem, boot from hd"
2008-05-01T06:46:00.000Z	amenado		Behfar-> I would try the try ubuntu..  thats way if you like it, you can proceed with install, and if not,..oh welll..
2008-05-01T06:47:00.000Z	Behfar		AMENADO, that doesn't work either though, when i try to launch it just stops
2008-05-01T06:48:00.000Z	amenado		Behfar-> perhaps you can choose check cd rom for defects, maybe your burn was not good enuff..
2008-05-01T06:48:00.000Z	amenado		Behfar-> and if it did tell you it did not check out okay, then reburn it at slowest speed you can, like 1x
2008-05-01T06:50:00.000Z	Behfar		AMENADO, cd CD ROM CHECK comes up fine........ when i do TRY OUT UBUNTU it comes up and starts loading.. then it gets to RUNNING LOCAL BOOT SCRIPTS /etc/rc.local and says OK but it just sits there
2008-05-01T06:52:00.000Z	Behfar		can anyone assist me?  when i boot off newest build of ubuntu i get to RUNNING LOCAL BOOT SCIPRTS (/etc/rc.local) [OK] and it just hangs there
2008-05-01T06:53:00.000Z	Behfar		can anyone assist me?  when i boot off newest build of ubuntu i get to RUNNING LOCAL BOOT SCIPRTS (/etc/rc.local) [OK] and it just hangs there
2008-05-01T06:54:00.000Z	Behfar		matt in googling it i think u are right but idk what to do to troubleshoot
2008-05-01T06:57:00.000Z	Behfar		matt, its a ATI RADEO XPRESS 1250
2008-05-01T06:57:00.000Z	amenado		Behfar-> that dont look like a liveCD
2008-05-01T06:58:00.000Z	amenado		Behfar-> perhaps redownload the liveCD version..
2008-05-01T06:58:00.000Z	Behfar	amenado	the cd self check says it is fine
2008-05-01T06:58:00.000Z	amenado		Behfar-> yes, but is it livecd or alternatecd you downloaded?
2008-05-01T06:58:00.000Z	Behfar		liveCD
2008-05-01T06:59:00.000Z	Behfar		it boots to five choices, 1. try ubuntu, 2, install ubuntu, 3check CD  4 boot to hard drive ...... and some other crap
2008-05-01T07:00:00.000Z	amenado	Behfar	perhaps your pc is incompatible with livecd, thats why there is the alternatecd so one can use that instead of livecd
