2009-09-12T05:57:00.000Z	steven__		How do I remove Firefox 3.0 from my system? I cannot seem to do it
2009-09-12T05:57:00.000Z	steven__		When is that coming out? I seem to recall every 6 months or something
2009-09-12T05:58:00.000Z	steven__		Alright. I will keep.  Thank you guys
2009-09-12T05:59:00.000Z	steven__		My Firefox icon on top still directs me to 3.0.14 and I only know how to access 3.5 from CL.  How do I replace that icon with 3.5 shortcut?
2009-09-12T05:59:00.000Z	steven__		K, thanks
2009-09-12T06:00:00.000Z	IdleOne	steven__	right click on your FF icon and click properties, then change the icon but if you remove 3.0 you wont have the FF icon to use with 3.5
2009-09-12T06:02:00.000Z	IdleOne	steven__	you can also set FF-3.5 as default in System>Prefs>Preferred Applications
2009-09-12T06:07:00.000Z	IdleOne	steven__	in the properties for FF change the command to firefox-3.5 %u
2009-12-05T09:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	steven__	it should be in your Applications menu
2009-12-05T08:55:00.000Z	IdleOne	steven__	check out IDJC
2009-12-05T08:55:00.000Z	IdleOne	steven__	patience is a virtue

2010-07-04T05:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	steven__	I'll do a little searching and see if I can find an equivalent
2010-07-04T05:14:00.000Z	steven__	IdleOne	something to make beats with
2010-07-04T05:15:00.000Z	IdleOne	steven__	sudo apt-get install lmms
2010-07-04T05:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	steven__	if you prefer a GUI way. System > Adminstration > Synaptic Package Manager, search for lmms and then install it by checking the box to the left of it and click apply
