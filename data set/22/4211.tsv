2008-02-19T04:10:00.000Z	danbhfive	norml_advocate	whats a gnome driver?
2008-02-19T04:11:00.000Z	danbhfive	norml_advocate	well, gnome packages will work, but it will just install gnome as much as it needs to get it working
2008-02-19T04:11:00.000Z	danbhfive	norml_advocate	ndiswrapper is not part of gnome
2008-02-19T23:00:00.000Z	danbhfive	norml_advocate	what do you mean get it?  isn't it the default?
2008-02-19T23:01:00.000Z	norml_advocate	danbhfive	 it was the default, but I installed kde, and then switch back to gde.  and now its gone, and so is my quick user switch
2008-02-19T23:01:00.000Z	danbhfive	norml_advocate	try this: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^
2008-02-19T23:02:00.000Z	norml_advocate	danbhfive	just did that and there were 0 removed and 0 installed
2008-02-19T23:03:00.000Z	danbhfive	norml_advocate	did you put the ^ ?
2008-02-19T23:35:00.000Z	danbhfive	norml_advocate	did you try the command I gave you?  you left...

2008-02-19T23:35:00.000Z	danbhfive	norml_advocate	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^
2008-02-19T23:36:00.000Z	norml_advocate	danbhfive	 that brought my NM applet back, but not my quick user switch
2008-02-19T23:37:00.000Z	danbhfive	norml_advocate	maybe you just need to add the quick user thingy to the top panel bar
2008-02-19T23:37:00.000Z	norml_advocate	danbhfive	 good call im just dumb
2008-02-19T23:38:00.000Z	danbhfive	norml_advocate	cool  :)
