2005-10-24T10:50:00.000Z	Transporter_		Anyone know how I can use my iPod with ubuntu ?
2005-10-24T10:51:00.000Z	eruin	Transporter_	use rhythmbox (which comes with breezy) or fetch banshee
2005-10-24T10:51:00.000Z	eruin		banshee and gtkpod should both be able to upload songs to the ipod, while rbox is readonly basic support
2005-10-24T10:51:00.000Z	Transporter_	eruin	i use Hoary
2005-10-24T10:51:00.000Z	Transporter_	eruin	is there a program for hoary?
2005-10-24T10:51:00.000Z	eruin	Transporter_	then I suggest you upgrade :)
2005-10-24T10:51:00.000Z	Transporter_	eruin	how
2005-10-24T10:51:00.000Z	eruin	Transporter_	gtkpod probably
2005-10-24T10:52:00.000Z	Transporter_	eruin	will it be the same for iPod NANO ?
2005-10-24T10:52:00.000Z	eruin	Transporter_	sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list , then replace every occurrence of hoary with breezy - then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-10-24T10:52:00.000Z	eruin	Transporter_	well, mine works fine in breezy - didn't have it while I still used hoary
2005-10-24T10:52:00.000Z	Transporter_	eruin	do you have a ipod nano?
