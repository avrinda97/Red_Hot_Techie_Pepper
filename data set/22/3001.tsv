2010-12-17T08:21:00.000Z	delaman		SSD question:  The last time I used 10.10 on an SSD the hardware failed.  The corrupted everything had to return it, this was like 3 months ago or so.  Now i installed 10.10 on another SSD and the hardware SSD failed AGAIN!  does unbuntu 10.10 not good with SSD's ???
2010-12-17T08:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	delaman	well ssd have a limited write life,  I wonder if ubuntu is writing at some high interval?
2010-12-17T08:22:00.000Z	delaman	sacarlson	the first one lasted like 2 hours, this last one like 3 weeks
2010-12-17T08:23:00.000Z	delaman	sacarlson	im running 9.10 right now flawlessly for like 3 months now.
2010-12-17T08:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	delaman	well I guess you can look at iotop and get an idea of what trafic is put on your ssd device.  I can't imagin it could kill it that quick
2010-12-17T08:24:00.000Z	delaman	sacarlson	what is this "iotop" ive never heard of it and i dont know how to read the output :(
2010-12-17T08:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	delaman	at what mount point did you put this ssd that died in 10.10?
2010-12-17T08:25:00.000Z	delaman	sacarlson	mount point?  the default one the installer uses
2010-12-17T08:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	delaman	try man iotop or google it.  it will display the trafic to io devices
2010-12-17T08:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	delaman	does that include the swap partition?
2010-12-17T08:26:00.000Z	delaman	sacarlson	yes
2010-12-17T08:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	delaman	well that might kill it in some short time if you put alot of trafic on swap
2010-12-17T08:27:00.000Z	delaman	sacarlson	so you recommend doing away with swap?
2010-12-17T08:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	delaman	well I would analize were the trafic might be coming from before makeing any judgment
2010-12-17T08:28:00.000Z	delaman	sacarlson	im on a SSD with 9.10 it seems fine.  The problem is with 10.10.  I'm scared im just going to trash ANOTHER 60GB SSD.
2010-12-17T08:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	delaman	and if not much trafic can be seen maybe it's just bad hardware
2010-12-17T08:28:00.000Z	delaman	sacarlson	but TWO SSD's ?
2010-12-17T08:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	delaman	ya and one it two hours?  you can analize trafic on 10.10 without the ssd to verify
2010-12-17T08:29:00.000Z	delaman	sacarlson	not sure i understand completely your last sentence :(
2010-12-17T08:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	delaman	try 10.10 on a system that has no ssd like normal hdd and do the measurment with iotop or other there
2010-12-17T08:30:00.000Z	delaman	sacarlson	got cha
2010-12-17T08:31:00.000Z	delaman	sacarlson	thanks
