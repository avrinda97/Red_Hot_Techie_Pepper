2004-10-27T06:19:00.000Z	rublind		52.5 MB seems a bit small >_<
2004-10-27T06:19:00.000Z	rublind		I ordered more than 20 cd's, I ordered 200 something. ^_^
2004-10-27T06:19:00.000Z	rublind		I'm going to be handing them out like crazy.
2004-10-27T06:19:00.000Z	rublind		Try it.
2004-10-27T06:20:00.000Z	rublind		What, too many?
2004-10-27T06:20:00.000Z	rublind		What is ubuntu ?
2004-10-27T06:21:00.000Z	rublind		What does it mean.
2004-10-27T06:21:00.000Z	rublind		In what language?
2004-10-27T06:21:00.000Z	rublind		You have no idea how lazy I am. :P
2004-10-27T06:22:00.000Z	rublind		Ah, crap, one hour.
2004-10-27T06:22:00.000Z	SmokingFire	rublind	can't be worse then me, my nick name in real life is horizontal (always sleeping)
2004-10-27T06:23:00.000Z	SmokingFire	rublind	wouldn't know why not
2004-10-27T06:26:00.000Z	SmokingFire	rublind	I also tried many linux distro's and ubuntu is the only one I kept and booted into often, now windows is secondary, however the real reason is that I didn't like KDE or the bloated redhat, mandrake installs and synaptic is very sexy.
2004-10-27T06:29:00.000Z	SmokingFire	rublind	as far as I know yes. And I want to keep it that way.
2004-10-27T07:08:00.000Z	SmokingFire	rublind	just install java 5 (any version would do) and enable java in firefox should do it. It does for me.
2004-10-27T13:27:00.000Z	SmokingFire	rublind	I had a similair problem when using red hat, if had my usb cam attached (with build in mic) it would try to play sounds over the mic of the webcam. Never fixed that though. 
2004-10-27T13:32:00.000Z	SmokingFire	rublind	you mean change the background image?
2004-10-27T13:33:00.000Z	SmokingFire	rublind	you mean the loading images
2004-10-27T13:33:00.000Z	SmokingFire	rublind	when its loading gnome
2004-10-28T06:59:00.000Z	SmokingFire	rublind	you seem to have a lot of issues
2004-10-28T07:00:00.000Z	rublind	SmokingFire	I really want my sound card to work.
2004-10-28T07:01:00.000Z	SmokingFire	rublind	sound is so overated, think of the deaf.
