2006-07-05T06:26:00.000Z	Blissex	Tonren	there are some easily found web HOWTOs.
2006-07-05T06:26:00.000Z	Tonren	Blissex	It seems like none of them are written for Dapper.
2006-07-05T06:26:00.000Z	Blissex	Tonren	yo can use an HOWTO for Debian.
2006-07-05T06:26:00.000Z	Tonren	Blissex	Hmm, didn't know that
2006-07-05T06:27:00.000Z	Blissex	Tonren	while Ubuntu is not Debian, Debian docs are almost all applicable to Ubuntu.
2006-07-05T06:28:00.000Z	Tonren	Blissex	Wait a minute... I just relaized that I already have a /chroot/.  That's bizarre.  How can I tell which arch it's under?
2006-08-27T16:34:00.000Z	Blissex	Tonren	usually FTP dmons need also to _enable_ anonymous, and then enable uploads. Make sure also that you have the anonymous FTP directory set up right.
2006-08-27T16:34:00.000Z	Blissex	Tonren	anyhow check the logs in '/var/log', the FTP dmon will have logged the problem
2006-08-27T16:46:00.000Z	Blissex	Tonren	The FTPD definitely isn't creating ~ftp then create it right. IIRC there is a special package to setup anon-ftp
2006-08-27T16:36:00.000Z	Tonren	Blissex	I've definitely enabled anonymous - I've set it to anonymous-only mode.  There don't seem to be any switches to enable anonymous uploads
2006-08-27T16:47:00.000Z	Tonren	Blissex	It seems like yo'ure just supposed to create a user called "FTP" with /dev/null as the home dir
2006-08-27T16:47:00.000Z	Blissex	Tonren	not necessarily... It can be rather more involved. Usually anon FTP is done via 'chroot'.
2006-08-27T16:48:00.000Z	Tonren	Blissex	Oh.  Hm... yeah, and I don't see how it would work with the FTP user having a password and all
2006-08-27T16:48:00.000Z	Tonren	Blissex	I don't see any packages for setting up anonymous FTP though
2006-08-27T16:49:00.000Z	Blissex	Tonren	the 'ftp' user must not have a password. It must be a disabled account. there are PureFTPD tutorrials on setting up anonymous IIRC
2006-08-27T16:49:00.000Z	Tonren	Blissex	I've been googling for at least half an hour and haven't found any.  Think you could link me, possibly?
2006-08-27T16:59:00.000Z	Blissex	Tonren	in 'man pure-ftpd' look at the "AUTHENTICATION" and "ANONYMOUS FTP" sections. In general look at http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/383
2006-08-27T16:59:00.000Z	Tonren	Blissex	Thanks!
2006-08-27T05:00:00.000Z	Blissex	Tonren	in general also all server dmons have an option to produce more verbose/debug log messages. For 'pure-ftpd' that is '-d', this will help.
2006-08-27T05:02:00.000Z	Tonren	Blissex	How do I add pure-ftpd to the list of programs that should start with network services?
2006-08-27T05:02:00.000Z	Blissex	Tonren	'man update-rc.d'
2006-08-27T05:02:00.000Z	Tonren	Blissex	thanks again
