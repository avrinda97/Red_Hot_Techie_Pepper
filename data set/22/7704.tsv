2007-04-11T08:25:00.000Z	tim167	sorcerer	kjm's advice is probably wiser :)
2007-04-11T08:26:00.000Z	sorcerer		yeah i see it running the three gears does that mean it been installed correctly ?
2007-04-11T08:26:00.000Z	tim167	sorcerer	probably yes, did you use 'envy' to install nvidia ?

2007-04-11T08:29:00.000Z	tim167	sorcerer	i think so, of your 3d stuff runs smoothly than nvidia will be working...i guess
2007-04-11T08:29:00.000Z	tim167	sorcerer	if it works you dont have to do anything ofcourse...
2007-04-11T08:30:00.000Z	sorcerer	tim167	 ok .. hopefully now how do i get rid of that ugly plack out line everytime .. i minimise?
2007-04-11T08:31:00.000Z	tim167	sorcerer	what do you mean by plack out line ?
2007-04-11T08:31:00.000Z	sorcerer	tim167	 i mean black outline .. when the widows minimises .. its kinda delays reaction
2007-04-11T08:32:00.000Z	tim167		can anyone helo me add a new printer ? i plugged in a new one and the old one still shows as the only one in print dialogs
