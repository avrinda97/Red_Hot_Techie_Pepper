2005-04-23T10:15:00.000Z	libben		can u do /exec -o sudo and a command? cause it stalls on me when i try... it only works with no sudo commands?
2005-04-23T10:16:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	correct...unless you're within the "no-password" time
2005-04-23T10:19:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	I mean how sudo doesn't ask for a password within an amount of time (5 min?) after you entered your password previously.
2005-04-23T10:24:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	I don't think you can change it.
2005-04-23T10:24:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	oh wait you can
2005-04-23T10:24:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	it's something with /etc/sudoers...
2005-04-23T10:25:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	probably not
2005-04-23T10:26:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	read 'man sudoers'
2005-04-23T10:26:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	search for timeout
2005-04-23T10:39:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	what are you trying to do?
2005-04-23T10:41:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	I believe you need to run visudo and add 'Parameter ::= timestamp_timeout '=' minutes'
2005-04-23T10:41:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	sudo -v will extend the timeout...by 15 min. default.
2005-04-23T10:45:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	you could add yourself to the group 'disk'
2005-04-23T10:46:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	that would be a security problem though, you'd be able to e.g. zero-write your disks accidently.
2005-04-23T10:47:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	exactly.
2005-04-23T10:47:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	you could also add to /etc/sudoers:   libben root = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/hddtemp
2005-04-23T10:48:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	the above-suggested method seems the best to me.
2005-04-23T10:49:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	yep...
2005-04-23T10:49:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	add the line above.
2005-04-23T10:50:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	assuming your user account is libben
2005-04-23T10:50:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	use 'VISUAL=nano visudo'
2005-04-23T10:50:00.000Z	hawke_	libben	to make sure that you don't make a syntax-error that stops you from using sudo after you save the file. :-D
