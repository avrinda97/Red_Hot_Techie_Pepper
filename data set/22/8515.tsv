2005-07-26T07:09:00.000Z	funkyHat		guys, wtf is up with the latest ubuntu firefox release? anyone else getting problems?
2005-07-26T07:10:00.000Z	funkyHat		randomly crashing, it broke the first time i ran it (due to loads of extensions no doubt, but it's also crashing on a clean profile)
2005-07-26T07:11:00.000Z	funkyHat		that would be great, if i could get to about:config without launching the browser ;)
2005-07-26T07:12:00.000Z	pitti	funkyHat	odd, it's running fine here for three days...
2005-07-26T07:12:00.000Z	pitti	funkyHat	however, I have a similar random crash on tbird (which I didn't yet relase), I'm investigating
2005-07-26T07:13:00.000Z	pitti	funkyHat	yes, but it's on my disk for three days (not completely patched, though)
2005-07-26T07:13:00.000Z	pitti	funkyHat	I wanted to test the complete update for at least a day
2005-07-26T07:14:00.000Z	pitti	funkyHat	lemme figure out that tbird crash, I have reasons to assume that it is exactly the same cause; however, I can't reproduce the ffox crash
2005-07-26T07:16:00.000Z	funkyHat	pitti	is it a new version of tbird too? as i'm not getting any issues with that at all
2005-07-26T07:16:00.000Z	pitti	funkyHat	I'm still preparing it
2005-07-26T07:17:00.000Z	pitti	funkyHat	it's a PITA, there are so many and so big patches, I already worked on it for two days
2005-07-26T09:06:00.000Z	funkyHat	pitti	have you discovered the problem with firefox yet?
2005-07-26T09:06:00.000Z	pitti	funkyHat	I'm at it, no
2005-07-31T16:39:00.000Z	pitti	funkyHat	now you'll get 1.0.6 in hoary
2005-07-31T16:40:00.000Z	funkyHat	pitti	when?
2005-07-31T16:46:00.000Z	funkyHat	pitti	i can't see firefox 1.0.6 yet :(
2005-07-31T16:51:00.000Z	pitti	funkyHat	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/m/mozilla-firefox/ <- it's right there
2005-07-31T16:53:00.000Z	funkyHat	pitti	do i have to uninstall 'firefox' and the other backports packages i installed in order to see mozilla-firefox 1.0.6?
2005-07-31T16:57:00.000Z	pitti	funkyHat	oh, of course; I never looked at backports, and we can't support them
2005-07-31T16:57:00.000Z	pitti	funkyHat	so obviously the backports guys messed up the package name
2005-07-31T16:57:00.000Z	funkyHat	pitti	but it still seems strange that i can't see 1.0.6 in synaptic even though i've got backports disabled?
2005-07-31T16:58:00.000Z	pitti	funkyHat	update the lists first?
