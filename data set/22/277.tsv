2012-10-03T21:59:00.000Z	Boreeas		My sound stopped working. I tried rebooting, restarting pulseaudio, reinstalled pulseaudio, but none of that helped. Alsamixer reports nothing as muted, lscpi logs are here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1258478/
2012-10-03T21:59:00.000Z	Boreeas		Does anyone know what to do?
2012-10-03T22:01:00.000Z	willdabeast	Boreeas	it was working before?
2012-10-03T22:01:00.000Z	Boreeas	willdabeast	Yes. The problem came out of nowhere
2012-10-03T22:07:00.000Z	willdabeast	Boreeas	I'd just try an older version, see if it is the current version that's causing problems.
2012-10-03T22:09:00.000Z	willdabeast	Boreeas	I mean it could still be a buggy version, just try the older.
2012-10-03T22:11:00.000Z	willdabeast	Boreeas	or just try rm -r ~/.pulse ~/.pulse-cookie if you don't want to do that yet.
2012-10-03T22:15:00.000Z	willdabeast	Boreeas	any luck?
2012-10-03T22:15:00.000Z	Boreeas	willdabeast	After removing .pulse and .pulse-cookie, it doesn't even start anymore
2012-10-03T22:17:00.000Z	willdabeast	Boreeas	do speaker-test in terminal too
2012-10-03T22:19:00.000Z	willdabeast	Boreeas	once you've reinstalled pulse try pulseaudio --check if you haven't already.
2012-10-03T22:19:00.000Z	willdabeast	Boreeas	can you hear anything during the speaker-test?
2012-10-03T22:20:00.000Z	willdabeast	Boreeas	type padsp
2012-10-03T22:21:00.000Z	Boreeas	willdabeast	Nothing happens
2012-10-03T22:22:00.000Z	willdabeast	Boreeas	I don't know, at this point I'm just going to try and figure this out with you.
2012-10-03T22:26:00.000Z	willdabeast	Boreeas	you could look at http://ptspts.blogspot.com/2010/11/how-to-disable-pulseaudio-on-ubuntu.html
2012-10-03T22:26:00.000Z	willdabeast	Boreeas	maybe killing it will help. Won't hurt.
2012-10-03T23:14:00.000Z	Boreeas	willdabeast	Sorry, it froze my computer and I had to reboot. Following the article you gave me worked, I have sound again.
2012-10-03T23:58:00.000Z	willdabeast	Boreeas	so did it work?
2012-10-04T00:01:00.000Z	Boreeas	willdabeast	More or less. Looks like I will have to write my own program to get bindings with the media keys thought. Thanks a lot!
2012-10-04T00:02:00.000Z	willdabeast	Boreeas	no problem, you can probably go into the config file though and change those bindings unless you've tried that.
2012-10-04T00:05:00.000Z	Boreeas	willdabeast	Config file of what? Pulseaudio is disabled now, and ALSA doesn't offer media key bindings, I think?
