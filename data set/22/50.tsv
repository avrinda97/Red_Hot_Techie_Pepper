2012-09-24T19:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ishitva	 first thing to do would be backup any imporant data. and be sure you got your windows restore disks. just in case
2012-09-24T19:33:00.000Z	Ishitva	dr_willis	do I need to create a seperate partition for Ubuntu ?
2012-09-24T19:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ishitva	 thats normally done by the installer.
2012-09-24T19:34:00.000Z	Ishitva	dr_willis	 How do we partition the disks ?
2012-09-24T19:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ishitva	 it would be an odd windows install these days that only has one partition
