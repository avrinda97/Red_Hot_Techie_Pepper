2005-07-12T05:12:00.000Z	jtan325__		and my IP should be the address next to "inet addr:"
2005-07-12T05:12:00.000Z	jtan325__		on the second line?
2005-07-12T05:13:00.000Z	jtan325__		yeah i did, i know what my ip is
2005-07-12T05:13:00.000Z	jtan325__		what i am going to do
2005-07-12T05:14:00.000Z	jtan325__		no no i understand which one's my ip. but what i am going to do is
2005-07-12T05:14:00.000Z	jtan325__		install openssh-server on this computer i'm on right now at home
2005-07-12T05:14:00.000Z	jtan325__		and then try to ssh in from work
2005-07-12T05:14:00.000Z	jtan325__		and hopefully i can remote desktop using X11 forwarding or something, which i have no idea what that means
2005-07-12T05:15:00.000Z	jtan325__		what is the command line to get to that feature
2005-07-12T05:15:00.000Z	jtan325__		(i use fluxbox)
2005-07-12T05:15:00.000Z	js_	jtan325__	for X11 forwarding you need a local x server on the box you want to forward to
2005-07-12T05:17:00.000Z	js_	jtan325__	on what os?
2005-07-12T05:17:00.000Z	js_	jtan325__	if youve already got a graphic environment on both you have an X server running on both
2005-07-12T05:18:00.000Z	js_	jtan325__	you need to enable X11Forward in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2005-07-12T05:18:00.000Z	js_	jtan325__	then ssh with ssh -X user@host
2005-07-12T05:18:00.000Z	js_	jtan325__	you can also set up your display manager to accept XDMCP requests, so you can log on to it remotely using the display manager
2005-07-12T05:27:00.000Z	js_	jtan325__	is your server behind router/NAT?
2005-07-12T05:27:00.000Z	jtan325__	js_	i would think so, i am on a campus network
2005-07-12T05:28:00.000Z	js_	jtan325__	then, unless you have access to forward traffic to your ssh server, you're out of luck
2005-07-12T05:28:00.000Z	js_	jtan325__	enter www.whatismyip.com with the ssh server box
2005-07-12T05:31:00.000Z	jtan325__	js_	if i can vnc into my home computer from work with linux, when my home computer is running windows, does that mean the routing is working?
2005-07-12T05:32:00.000Z	js_	jtan325__	if internet works it's correct
