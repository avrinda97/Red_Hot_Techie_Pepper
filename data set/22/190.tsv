2012-04-17T01:41:00.000Z	iNeal		Anyone know how to fix the "only wallpaper loading" on Ubuntu 11.10? When I log in, it only loads the wallpaper, nothing else.
2012-04-17T01:42:00.000Z	scientes	iNeal	click the ubuntu icon next to your name, and select ubuntu-2d, and see if that works
2012-04-17T01:43:00.000Z	iNeal	scientes	I don't even have that top bar - all I see if the wallpaper. But I did try loading ubuntu-2d via terminal; it didn't help.
2012-04-17T01:43:00.000Z	scientes	iNeal	try metacity --replace via terminal, DISPLAY=:0 metacity --replace
2012-04-17T01:45:00.000Z	scientes	iNeal	you can get back to the login screen with ctrl-alt-sysrq-k
2012-04-17T01:46:00.000Z	scientes	iNeal	(sysrq == print screen button)
2012-04-17T01:46:00.000Z	iNeal	scientes	It's a server :/
2012-04-17T01:48:00.000Z	iNeal	scientes	this is what i see when i log in - http://cl.ineal.me/1L1G422B0j1S383z0Z1B
2012-04-17T01:48:00.000Z	scientes	iNeal	yeah you need to use ubuntu-2d
2012-04-17T01:49:00.000Z	scientes	iNeal	or run metacity --replace
2012-04-17T01:49:00.000Z	scientes	iNeal	you only have to set the DISPLAY variable if you are running from a tty that isn't in the desktop session
2012-04-17T01:49:00.000Z	iNeal	scientes	Ah, with metacity --replace, i get the top thing to close folder/apps
2012-04-17T01:50:00.000Z	iNeal	scientes	Is there any way I can make it load ubuntu-2d by default?
2012-04-17T01:50:00.000Z	scientes	iNeal	yes, click the ubuntu icon next to your name when you log in, and select ubuntu-2d
2012-04-17T01:51:00.000Z	scientes	iNeal	or install gnome-session-fallback for a more gnome 2 like experience (with gnome-panel)
2012-04-17T01:51:00.000Z	iNeal	scientes	It's a server and I use NX NoMachine to login
2012-04-17T01:52:00.000Z	scientes	iNeal	the sessions are in /usr/share/xsessions/
2012-04-17T01:52:00.000Z	scientes	iNeal	im not sure how nx selects them
2012-04-17T01:53:00.000Z	iNeal	scientes	I want nx to select ubuntu-2d right? or gnome-fallback?
2012-04-17T01:53:00.000Z	scientes	iNeal	either one should work, choose depending on your preferences
2012-04-17T01:53:00.000Z	scientes	iNeal	xfce would also work
2012-04-17T02:01:00.000Z	iNeal	scientes	Awesome, I changed nx config to load gnome-classic and it worked!
