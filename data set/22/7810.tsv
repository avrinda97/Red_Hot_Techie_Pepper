2007-02-15T11:46:00.000Z	sstchur		seeking some wireless help:  lspci lists my Atheros card, but iwconfig does not list ath0 anywhere (only lo, eth0, and sit0 all with "no wireless extensions")
2007-02-15T11:46:00.000Z	cafuego_	sstchur	You need to install the atheros drivers.
2007-02-15T11:46:00.000Z	cafuego_	sstchur	'sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)
2007-02-15T11:47:00.000Z	sstchur	cafuego_	I installed madwifi... what more do I need?
2007-02-15T11:47:00.000Z	sstchur	cafuego_	 ah... okay
2007-02-15T11:47:00.000Z	cafuego_	sstchur	The drivers are precomiled for your kernel in that package.
2007-02-15T11:47:00.000Z	cafuego_	sstchur	if you built ones by hand, you may need to load the drivers by hand. Using prebuilt is easier I guess.
2007-02-15T11:47:00.000Z	sstchur	cafuego_	I didn't buld anything by hand....
2007-02-15T11:48:00.000Z	sstchur	cafuego_	 what does the line you gave me do exactly?  installes restricted modules I gather, but what is the -$ and (uname -r ) ?>
2007-02-15T11:48:00.000Z	cafuego_	sstchur	$(uname -r) is replaced with the current kernel version.
2007-02-15T11:49:00.000Z	sstchur	cafuego_	 oh!  well, that's very handy
2007-02-15T11:49:00.000Z	cafuego_	sstchur	aye :-)
2007-02-15T12:06:00.000Z	sstchur	cafuego_	 ok that time it worked, and now knetworkmanager is picking up my wireless
2007-02-15T12:00:00.000Z	sstchur	cafuego_	so... after installing the restricted modules... what more do I need?  Nothing seems to have changed
2007-02-15T12:01:00.000Z	cafuego_	sstchur	sudo modprobe ath_pci
2007-02-15T12:01:00.000Z	cafuego_	sstchur	(on reboot, stuff should auto-load)
2007-02-15T12:02:00.000Z	sstchur	cafuego_	 okay, that's kind of what I though... I tried that (forgot the sudo) and the modprobe failed..... I then rebooted, tried it with the sudo, but this time I get module ath_pci not found
2007-02-15T12:02:00.000Z	cafuego_	sstchur	ghhrrrmmm..
2007-02-15T12:03:00.000Z	cafuego_	sstchur	can you check if 'dpkg -l restricted-modules-$(uname -r);' lists 'em as installed?
2007-02-15T12:04:00.000Z	sstchur	cafuego_	I must have screwed up somewhere:  "No packages found matching restricted-modules-2.6.17-11-generic."
2007-02-15T12:04:00.000Z	cafuego_	sstchur	Ok, retry :-)
2007-02-15T12:07:00.000Z	sstchur	cafuego_	 on the freak chance that I don't see wireless when I reboot, what would that mean?  Is it even possible?
