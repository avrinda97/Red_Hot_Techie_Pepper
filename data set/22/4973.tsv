2008-03-10T16:59:00.000Z	ElTimo		how about me?
2008-03-10T17:00:00.000Z	ElTimo		ok
2008-03-10T17:00:00.000Z	ElTimo		here goes then
2008-03-10T17:01:00.000Z	ElTimo		I just recompiled the kernel for EM64T, and while I do have the NVidia proprietary drivers installed and configured, I can't for the life of me get sound or wireless. I have a dell latitude D820 laptop with (I believe) the intel pro 3945 wireless
2008-03-10T17:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ElTimo	i'm guessing you have intelhDA sound
2008-03-10T17:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ElTimo	64bit IntelHDA, not sure how to fix that one.
2008-03-10T17:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ElTimo	what model is your dell again?
2008-03-10T17:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ElTimo	any particular reason you installed 64bit?
2008-03-10T17:13:00.000Z	ElTimo	IndyGunFreak	it's whole buttloads faster
2008-03-10T17:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ElTimo	?.. not really
2008-03-10T17:13:00.000Z	ElTimo	IndyGunFreak	maybe its just a placebo effect then
2008-03-10T17:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ElTimo	who told you it was butloads faster?
2008-03-10T17:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ElTimo	lol, have you used 32bit?
2008-03-10T17:15:00.000Z	ElTimo	IndyGunFreak	I don't know why, but it just seemed slow
2008-03-10T17:17:00.000Z	ElTimo	IndyGunFreak	and anyway, why only use half your bits? ;)
2008-03-10T17:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ElTimo	well... i've got a new corvette, but ive never driven 160mph
2008-03-10T17:17:00.000Z	ElTimo	IndyGunFreak	touch√©
2008-03-10T17:18:00.000Z	ElTimo	IndyGunFreak	although I do actually play ut2004 and quake4 a lot on linux
2008-03-10T17:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ElTimo	well, i dont play windows games, except pokerstars, which hardly requires major horsepower.
2008-03-10T17:20:00.000Z	ElTimo	IndyGunFreak	I use the linux-native versions ;)
2008-03-10T17:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ElTimo	oh ok.
2008-03-10T17:24:00.000Z	ElTimo	IndyGunFreak	the reason im using 64 bit is because the processor option for core 2 duo in the kernel config is only available as 64 bit
