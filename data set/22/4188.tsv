2008-02-24T12:28:00.000Z	jarrettgreen		Can anyone help with a static IP issue?
2008-02-24T12:29:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jarrettgreen	maybe
2008-02-24T12:30:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jarrettgreen	I need your question again please
2008-02-24T12:31:00.000Z	jarrettgreen	jimcooncat	- I have a static IP setup in my interfaces file. but it won't take. no connection, no ability to ssh in, etc. bukk just had me run dhclient and all is fine. Ecxepct that I'm now bound to .6 rather than .20 that I specified
2008-02-24T12:32:00.000Z	jarrettgreen		in another note, is my ubuntu dapper drake a "glibc-based system"
2008-02-24T12:32:00.000Z	jarrettgreen		?
2008-02-24T12:32:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jarrettgreen	what's handing you the dhcp? if it's not a cheapo router you could just have it assign your MAC to the address you want
2008-02-24T12:33:00.000Z	jarrettgreen		It's not cheapo.. I dunno $130.. I don't know what cheapo would be
2008-02-24T12:33:00.000Z	jarrettgreen		but I did think about it
2008-02-24T12:33:00.000Z	jarrettgreen		dhcp reservation
2008-02-24T12:33:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jarrettgreen	it's cheapo if it doesn't let you do it :-)
2008-02-24T12:33:00.000Z	jarrettgreen		lol
2008-02-24T12:33:00.000Z	jarrettgreen		true
2008-02-24T12:33:00.000Z	jarrettgreen		But I worked this morning
2008-02-24T12:35:00.000Z	jarrettgreen		jimmcooncat - dumb irc question, but how are you making your responses to me a different color?
2008-02-24T12:35:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jarrettgreen	other than that you'd have to dig hard to troubleshoot your file. You might want to reboot (argh!) if you haven't since your last change.
2008-02-24T12:36:00.000Z	jarrettgreen		gotcha
2008-02-24T12:37:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jarrettgreen	maybe I'm majick
2008-02-24T12:37:00.000Z	jarrettgreen	jimcooncat	here's my interfaces file http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/57166/
2008-02-24T12:41:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jarrettgreen	mine works without the "network" and "broadcast" lines -- I suspect the "network"
2008-02-24T12:42:00.000Z	jarrettgreen	jimcooncat	- ok I took it out, and did a network restart
2008-02-24T12:50:00.000Z	jarrettgreen	jimcooncat	- did not work, reverted back to using dhclient
