2009-03-04T00:22:00.000Z	MFen		anyone know how to make gnome-terminal --tab-with-profile=foo actually work? it's supposed to put a new tab in an existing window, and it's broken
2009-03-04T00:22:00.000Z	MFen		i always get a new window instead
2009-03-04T00:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MFen	wrong sysntax, try --tab-with-profile-internal-id=PROFILEID
2009-03-04T00:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MFen	http://pwet.fr/man/linux/commandes/gnome_terminal
2009-03-04T00:25:00.000Z	MFen	ActionParsnip	ok, what should PROFILEID *be* then?
2009-03-04T00:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MFen	the name of the profile of terminal, you may need to view the settings to get the profile name
2009-03-04T00:26:00.000Z	MFen	ActionParsnip	i don't think that does what you think it does
2009-03-04T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MFen	i dont use gnome-terminal but theres a man page for it and i couldnt see the option in there that you stated
2009-03-04T00:27:00.000Z	MFen	ActionParsnip	--tab-with-profile is in fact an option, it just doesn't do what i thought it did (talking on ##gnome).  --tab-with-profile-internal-id is documented as being something the shell itself uses to do session management
2009-03-04T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MFen	i see
2010-02-28T03:05:00.000Z	MFen	ActionParsnip	same ones i've always had.
2010-02-28T03:06:00.000Z	MFen	ActionParsnip	compiz --replace doesn't affect my startup. this is a startup problem

2010-02-28T03:07:00.000Z	MFen	ActionParsnip	that isn't how i installed it. should i do that?
2010-02-28T03:08:00.000Z	MFen	ActionParsnip	jockey-gtk was already installed
2010-02-28T03:08:00.000Z	MFen	ActionParsnip	it is
2010-02-28T03:26:00.000Z	MFen	ActionParsnip	ok! where do i set monitor refresh rate?
2010-02-28T03:32:00.000Z	MFen	ActionParsnip	i'm not following. my video is fine.. i can even start compiz manually. it just isn't starting when the desktop comes up
2010-07-23T04:39:00.000Z	MFen	ActionParsnip	i'm talking about the more typical situation where it's *not* in fstab.
2010-07-23T04:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MFen	usb partitions (you don't mount drives) can be equally in fstab
2010-07-23T04:42:00.000Z	MFen	ActionParsnip	what would that look like in dmesg? i don't see any errors
2012-08-06T22:54:00.000Z	MFen	ActionParsnip	as i said, that does not work for me
