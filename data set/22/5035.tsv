2008-03-24T01:43:00.000Z	Steve1		Hey guys I have some problems. Anyone know how to fix my system so it's dual boot Vista-Ubuntu?
2008-03-24T01:45:00.000Z	Steve1		Well I had XP on it previously and it was working fine with Ubuntu. But it finally cratered on me so I reinstalled Ubuntu since I don't have a Windows disc.
2008-03-24T01:45:00.000Z	Steve1		But now I have a Vista disc and it wont boot from the disc.
2008-03-24T01:45:00.000Z	Steve1		Also, gparted isn't detecting another harddrive.
2008-03-24T01:47:00.000Z	Steve1		Exactly nikrud. But it wont detect it in Ubuntu. So I cant reformat it. And like I said booting from it isn't working.
2008-03-24T01:48:00.000Z	Steve1		goose isn't that the desktop it comes with?
2008-03-24T01:48:00.000Z	Steve1		Gparted doesn't detect the NTFS partition of my first HD. So I can't reformat it.
2008-03-24T01:48:00.000Z	Steve1		Also, booting from the DVD(for Vista) doesn't work.
2008-03-24T01:50:00.000Z	Steve1		It only gives me the info on harddriveb. It doesn't show harddrivea.
2008-03-24T01:50:00.000Z	nikrud	Steve1	which is it?
2008-03-24T01:44:00.000Z	nikrud	Steve1	which way is it, vista or ubuntu not booting?
2008-03-24T01:46:00.000Z	nikrud	Steve1	probably looking to install on the first partition on the first drive.
2008-03-24T01:48:00.000Z	nikrud	Steve1	what do you mean, wont
2008-03-24T01:48:00.000Z	nikrud	Steve1	detect what?
2008-03-24T01:49:00.000Z	nikrud	Steve1	hm. When you say doesn't detect it, you mean it says that the first partition starts after ntfs?  what does   sudo fdisk -l   say
2008-03-24T01:51:00.000Z	nikrud	Steve1	I mean , which is the "it" you're talking about, gparted or sudo fdisk -l ?
2008-03-24T01:51:00.000Z	nikrud	Steve1	then the disk itself is not responding. Check the cabling
2008-03-24T01:53:00.000Z	nikrud	Steve1	no. if fdisk doesn't see it, you have bad disk/cabling , hardware issues
2008-03-24T01:54:00.000Z	nikrud	Steve1	check your cabling and all first.
2008-03-24T01:55:00.000Z	nikrud	Steve1	you would have to resize your ext3 partition, leaving some space on the front. gparted ____should____ be able to do that
2008-03-24T01:58:00.000Z	nikrud	Steve1	you'll need to boot to a live cd to change those partitions, you can't resize when they are mounted/in use
2008-03-24T01:58:00.000Z	nikrud	Steve1	there's a live gparted disk out there if you don't have the ubuntu live
