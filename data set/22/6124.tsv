2007-04-20T10:39:00.000Z	deepsa	dc	depends on what disk and partition it is
2007-04-20T10:39:00.000Z	dc	deepsa	i just downloaded the iso
2007-04-20T10:39:00.000Z	dc	deepsa	and i let ubuntu setup my partitions
2007-04-20T10:39:00.000Z	deepsa	dc	manual partition i prefer its safer
2007-04-20T10:40:00.000Z	dc	deepsa	how would you tell me to do it than?
2007-04-20T10:40:00.000Z	deepsa	dc	manual partitions
2007-04-20T10:40:00.000Z	dc	deepsa	i have 6.10 already, i want 7.04 and to leave my home folder and programs intact
2007-04-20T10:40:00.000Z	deepsa	dc	it will just choose manual and select a free partition (free means empty)
2007-04-20T10:41:00.000Z	dc	deepsa	what?  why mess with partitions when doing an os upgrade?
2007-04-20T10:41:00.000Z	deepsa	dc	well if you want your data to be safe then take a backup
2007-04-20T10:42:00.000Z	dc	deepsa	backup has been done, it gets done regularly, but i want to know if there is a way to avoid having to reload data
2007-04-20T10:42:00.000Z	deepsa	dc	i said how to do that earlier
2007-04-20T10:42:00.000Z	dc	deepsa	edit my partition table?
2007-04-20T10:42:00.000Z	deepsa	dc	just tell feisty which partition to get installed on
2007-04-20T10:43:00.000Z	dc	deepsa	i want it to install it on the same partition as fiesty...
2007-04-20T10:43:00.000Z	deepsa	dc	well then i guess you don't have any option data will be formatted
2007-04-20T10:44:00.000Z	dc	deepsa	so the only way to update and save data is through package manager?
2007-04-20T10:44:00.000Z	deepsa	dc	yeah apt-get dist upgrade
