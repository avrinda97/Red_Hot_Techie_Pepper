2007-03-15T14:41:00.000Z	Slart		does anyone know of a IM-client that handles icq, aim, msn and has a little more configurability than gaim? more like miranda but for linux
2007-03-15T14:42:00.000Z	Slart		!gwain
2007-03-15T14:42:00.000Z	Seveas	Slart	kopete perhaps
2008-01-25T04:10:00.000Z	Seveas	Slart	:)
2008-01-25T04:12:00.000Z	Seveas	Slart	makasd0: openvpn does what Slart suggests :)
2008-02-03T15:24:00.000Z	Slart	Seveas	isn't it 5? I seem to recall something about pyramids having square bottoms..
2008-02-03T15:24:00.000Z	Seveas	Slart	I call the triagonal pyramids pyramids as well :)
2008-02-03T15:25:00.000Z	Slart	Seveas	nggh.. to early to think about this
2008-02-09T21:17:00.000Z	Seveas	Slart	drop the b from stable when talking about debian ;
2008-02-09T21:18:00.000Z	Slart	Seveas	hehe.. never thought about it that way.. but indeed.. =)
2008-04-10T21:01:00.000Z	Seveas	Slart	precisely :)
2008-08-26T17:59:00.000Z	Slart	Seveas	it claims to be able to change login name in the man page.. what does it miss?
2008-08-26T17:59:00.000Z	Slart	Seveas	ah.. well.. home dir is easily fixed I guess.. it mentioned crontabs too
2008-08-26T18:01:00.000Z	Seveas	Slart	another thing that will fail: samba account
2008-08-26T18:01:00.000Z	Slart	Seveas	seems the sudoers file might have to be edited too
2008-08-26T18:01:00.000Z	Slart	Seveas	seems easier just to create a new user
2008-08-26T18:02:00.000Z	Seveas	Slart	not in default ubuntu setup (uses the admin group)
2009-01-14T21:51:00.000Z	Seveas	Slart	dnsmasq is overkill if you just want a simple cache :)
2009-01-14T21:52:00.000Z	Slart	Seveas	I just didn't know anything simpler.. myself I use bind.. =)
2009-01-14T21:52:00.000Z	Slart	Seveas	but nscd looks nice
2009-01-14T21:52:00.000Z	Seveas	Slart	yeah, I use bind too 'cause I want more than just caching :)
2009-01-29T18:09:00.000Z	Seveas	Slart	speak for yourself :P
