2008-01-09T22:43:00.000Z	Aeleon		Why not? You don't condone anonymous browsing?
2008-01-09T22:44:00.000Z	Aeleon		Don't worry.
2008-01-09T22:44:00.000Z	Aeleon		It's not for illegal uses, though.
2008-01-09T22:45:00.000Z	Aeleon		I did.
2008-01-09T22:45:00.000Z	Aeleon		Too many ports, they say. and I need UDP as well as tcp.
2008-01-09T22:45:00.000Z	Aeleon		I'm using my own ISP to do this, I'm not doing anything illegal.

2008-01-09T22:48:00.000Z	dfcarney	Aeleon	what are you trying to do, exactly?
2008-01-09T22:48:00.000Z	Aeleon	dfcarney	I'm trying to use the internet connection I have at home here in the UK.
2008-01-09T22:48:00.000Z	dfcarney	Aeleon	to do what?
2008-01-09T22:49:00.000Z	Aeleon	dfcarney	to use BT and Second Life.
2008-01-09T22:49:00.000Z	dfcarney	Aeleon	is your ISP blocking ports or traffic shaping?
2008-01-09T22:49:00.000Z	dfcarney	Aeleon	why can't you access SecondLife from home?
2008-01-09T22:49:00.000Z	Aeleon	dfcarney	my uni connection is blocking ports.
2008-01-09T22:50:00.000Z	dfcarney	Aeleon	so, by "at home" you mean at university then?
2008-01-09T22:50:00.000Z	Aeleon	dfcarney	I can at home, where my ubuntu box is, but I can' here at school.
2008-01-09T22:50:00.000Z	dfcarney	Aeleon	ah, well that's a policy decision by the school 'cause they obviously don't want people playing SecondLife :)
2008-01-09T22:50:00.000Z	dfcarney	Aeleon	as i'm sure you've guessed
2008-01-09T22:52:00.000Z	dfcarney	Aeleon	i don't want to actively promote circumventing your IT department's policies, but everything you need to know about ssh is in 'man ssh'
2008-01-09T22:52:00.000Z	Aeleon	dfcarney	- when I explained that to them, they were perfectly willing, but the fact is that SL uses lots of ports made it nearly impossible to get approval.
2008-01-09T22:52:00.000Z	dfcarney	Aeleon	this is off-topic, unfortunately
2008-01-09T22:53:00.000Z	dfcarney	Aeleon	let's go to #ubuntu-offtopic to continue this
