2007-11-29T14:42:00.000Z	timsandtoms		Hey guys? Is there a way to use Rhinoceros(the 3d modeler) on ubuntu?
2007-11-29T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	timsandtoms	is it in the ubutnu repo
2007-11-29T14:43:00.000Z	timsandtoms	ikonia	the ubuntu whato? New to ubuntu btw
2007-11-29T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	timsandtoms	take a look at the pm from ubotu
2007-11-29T14:45:00.000Z	ikonia	timsandtoms	it tells you how to use the package manager, for which you can search for the package you want
2007-11-29T14:45:00.000Z	ikonia	timsandtoms	I dont' need that
2007-11-29T14:45:00.000Z	ikonia	timsandtoms	I made a typo the first time
2007-11-29T14:45:00.000Z	timsandtoms	ikonia	Haha, thanks. Thats why i sent it back to you, show ya what i got
2007-11-29T14:48:00.000Z	timsandtoms	ikonia	How does that help install Rhino? I have a CD for it for Windows
2007-11-29T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	timsandtoms	I said see if there is a version in the repos. If you want to use the windows version you will have to use "wine"
2007-11-29T14:49:00.000Z	ikonia	timsandtoms	that should work
2007-11-29T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	timsandtoms	check ubotus message again ;)
2007-11-29T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	timsandtoms	try it under wine
2007-12-05T14:56:00.000Z	timsandtoms	ikonia	What are the advantages of an actual IRC client over Pidgin? This is really my first IRC room I've been in, I don't know anything about IRC really...
2007-12-05T14:57:00.000Z	ikonia	timsandtoms	just more features in native irc clients
2007-12-05T14:57:00.000Z	ikonia	timsandtoms	depends how much you want to interact
2007-12-05T14:57:00.000Z	timsandtoms	ikonia	Coupla examples?
2007-12-05T14:58:00.000Z	ikonia	timsandtoms	for example if you are an operater, you can bind functions, that sort of thing
2007-12-05T14:59:00.000Z	timsandtoms	ikonia	Ah, ok. Any suggestions on which I should get if I do get one? I'm kinda fond of Pidgin and Windows Live messengers interface, similar would be great
2007-12-05T14:59:00.000Z	ikonia	timsandtoms	if you like the interface, stick with pidgin
2007-12-05T15:01:00.000Z	ikonia	timsandtoms	its all personal preference, try them, see what you like
2007-12-05T15:01:00.000Z	timsandtoms	ikonia	ok, will do
