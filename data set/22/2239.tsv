2011-02-21T14:34:00.000Z	Jonii^		That's the point, I'm not gonna delete everything :/
2011-02-21T14:34:00.000Z	Jonii^		Now, I need to figure out how to deal with this installation program
2011-02-21T14:34:00.000Z	Jonii^		And if either of those devices it found would be safe to install
2011-02-21T14:35:00.000Z	Jonii^		What does WUBI do then?
2011-02-21T14:36:00.000Z	Jonii^		Humm... I tried that once before, it didn't work, though since then, I've decrypted my hard drive
2011-02-21T14:38:00.000Z	Jonii^		That doesn't sound too good
2011-02-21T14:38:00.000Z	Jonii^		I'd rather just figure out that partition/installation program
2011-02-21T14:38:00.000Z	Jonii^		Like, it should be possible to just install Ubuntu to an empty space on my disk?
2011-02-21T14:39:00.000Z	Jonii^		14,5 GB
2011-02-21T14:40:00.000Z	Jonii^		Windows shows Disk 0 partitioned into 4 different... What's the English word for that? Like, drive or something? That invisible windows backup drive, C:, D:, and empty space
2011-02-21T14:41:00.000Z	histo	Jonii^	partitions
2011-02-21T14:41:00.000Z	histo	Jonii^	you could install it to the unpartioned empty space
2011-02-21T14:42:00.000Z	Jonii^	histo	that's why there is empty space in the first place
2011-02-21T14:42:00.000Z	histo	Jonii^	or you can shrink the windows partition and give yourself more room to install ubuntu.
2011-02-21T14:42:00.000Z	histo	Jonii^	you can also install ubuntu inside of the windows drive.
2011-02-21T14:43:00.000Z	histo	Jonii^	are you booted from the live cd at the moment?
2011-02-21T14:44:00.000Z	histo	Jonii^	well while you in the livecd. you can check which partitions it's seeing by clicking Applications > Accessories > terminal  and running the command sudo fdisk -l    That will list the partitions
2011-02-21T15:22:00.000Z	histo	Jonii^	What is your question about partitioning?
2011-02-21T15:23:00.000Z	Jonii^	histo	my drive has a broken partition table, somehow
2011-02-21T15:24:00.000Z	histo	Jonii^	okay one sec. if not someone else can help you
2011-02-21T15:25:00.000Z	histo	Jonii^	you can have up to 4 primary partitions and thats the limit
2011-02-21T15:27:00.000Z	histo	Jonii^	can you install pastebinit to the box and then just sudo fdisk -l | pastebinit
