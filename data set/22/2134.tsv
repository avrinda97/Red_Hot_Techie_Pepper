2010-04-23T21:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	theadmin	uh I mean I had to killall pulse audio back in 8.04 quite a bit here and there, but other then that no problems with pulse audio ever on this computer untill 9.10
2010-04-23T21:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	theadmin	then I just coudn't not have sound for virtual machines, and I knew messing around with pulse audio would be no fun,  plus I wanted to put another distro on  here,  I did and wow that was so easy to disable pulse audio and have sound working in Virtualbox again
