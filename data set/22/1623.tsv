2010-03-11T04:50:00.000Z	professional-are	Losha	 no it does not
2010-03-11T04:51:00.000Z	Losha	professional-are	does your drive have a pinhole in the front?
2010-03-11T04:52:00.000Z	professional-are	Losha	 no it does not
2010-03-11T04:52:00.000Z	Losha	professional-are	are you sure? Nearly all of them do, as an emergency release mechanism....
2010-03-11T04:53:00.000Z	professional-are	Losha	i checked right now it doesnt
2010-03-11T04:53:00.000Z	professional-are	Losha	 i know because my laptop had one but not this desktop
2010-03-11T04:54:00.000Z	Losha	professional-are	don't know what to tell you. Every single one of mine has it. Check in #hardware ?
2010-03-11T04:54:00.000Z	professional-are	Losha	how do i do that
2010-03-11T04:54:00.000Z	Losha	professional-are	just /join #hardware and ask in that channel....
2010-03-11T04:55:00.000Z	professional-are	Losha	 it says canot join its invite only
2010-03-11T04:56:00.000Z	Losha	professional-are	sigh. Well in your place, I would shutdown the machine, making sure it powers off, and hope that when you power it back up, it resets the drive and the eject button starts working...
2010-03-11T04:57:00.000Z	professional-are	Losha	 lol thats what i did and it didnt work, thats why its weird
2010-03-11T04:58:00.000Z	professional-are	Losha	 i guess il use windows to burn my isos
2010-03-11T04:58:00.000Z	Losha	professional-are	what brand/model is the drive, so I can avoid it in the future?
2010-03-11T04:58:00.000Z	professional-are	Losha	i typed sudo eject and it worked
2010-03-11T04:59:00.000Z	Losha	professional-are	good, still doesn't excuse having no pinhole. Cheap-ass hardware....
2010-03-11T05:00:00.000Z	professional-are	Losha	 yeah i guess i got it for  dollars with 8gb ram quadcore processor and 1gb ati video card tv tunner and wireless antena and 1tb hard drive so im not complaining
