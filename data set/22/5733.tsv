2007-03-25T05:48:00.000Z	rpc	tbuss	install vsftpd and have a look at conf.. you can make it really secure in seconds
2007-03-25T05:49:00.000Z	tbuss	rpc	that is where i run into problems, I tried a how to for proftpd but ran into problem in the config
2007-03-25T05:49:00.000Z	rpc	tbuss	forget about proftpd... use vsftpd
2007-03-25T05:49:00.000Z	rpc	tbuss	it's the most secure ftpd ever created.. even ISPs use it often novadays
2007-03-25T05:50:00.000Z	tbuss	rpc	I'm just concerned that by sheer inexperience I will compromise the integrity of my data
2007-03-25T05:50:00.000Z	rpc	tbuss	why would you?
2007-03-25T05:51:00.000Z	rpc	tbuss	vsftpd is easy as pie
2007-03-25T05:51:00.000Z	tbuss	rpc	I get confused with the anonymous config but also how to secure by requiring password
2007-03-25T05:52:00.000Z	rpc	tbuss	disable anon and change default port first of all
2007-03-25T05:52:00.000Z	rpc	tbuss	just get rid of anon completely
2007-03-25T05:52:00.000Z	tbuss	rpc	how do I config for user authentication?
2007-03-25T05:53:00.000Z	tbuss	rpc	will I need to send a passwrd to all family members or set up accounts for each on the server
2007-03-25T05:54:00.000Z	rpc	tbuss	you add users on your box but you give them /bin/false instead of /bin/bash in passwd
2007-03-25T05:54:00.000Z	rpc	tbuss	that way they will use shell login/pass but that won't work for ssh.. only for ftp
2007-03-25T05:54:00.000Z	tbuss	rpc	so users with a windows machine will still be able to connect, no client software needed
2007-03-25T05:55:00.000Z	rpc	tbuss	oh they will need a client, like total commander for instance
2007-03-25T05:55:00.000Z	rpc	tbuss	just make very sure that you change the default 21 port to something else
2007-03-25T05:55:00.000Z	tbuss	rpc	back to anon, how to uninstall
2007-03-25T05:55:00.000Z	tbuss	rpc	will 1980 work for default port
2007-03-25T05:55:00.000Z	rpc	tbuss	read the comments in conf.. they are pretty self explanatory
2007-03-25T05:56:00.000Z	tbuss	rpc	bansh3: atoponce: thanks for all your help
2007-03-25T05:57:00.000Z	rpc	tbuss	np
