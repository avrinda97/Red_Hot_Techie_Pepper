2006-11-27T15:22:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	neobyte420	firestarter can help you with that.
2006-11-27T15:23:00.000Z	neobyte420	fyrestrtr	do you know about how i can solve my issue
2006-11-27T15:23:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	neobyte420	what is the problem exactly?
2006-11-27T15:25:00.000Z	neobyte420	fyrestrtr	when i go to preferences to nettwork settings there is a create new DHVP configuration option...i select it and accept but it gives me a error

2006-11-27T15:27:00.000Z	neobyte420	fyrestrtr	any ideas on how to get this up and running?
2006-11-27T15:27:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	neobyte420	not sure to be honest, I always did it "manually"
2006-11-27T15:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	neobyte420	... why? if it works, leave it be.
2006-11-27T15:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	neobyte420	maybe. You'd have to check the website or LP
2006-11-27T15:30:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	neobyte420	that just means your ports aren't forwarded properly.
2006-11-27T15:30:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	neobyte420	if you want my suggestion, use shorewall :)
2006-11-27T15:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	neobyte420	yes, it can do that, but you need to setup a dhcp server first.
2006-11-27T15:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	neobyte420	also, just a warning -- there is no gui for shorewall, its all command line and text files.
2006-11-27T15:32:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	neobyte420	but its dead easy to setup :)
2006-11-27T15:32:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	neobyte420	there are sample configurations on the shorewall.net website. Probably one that fits your situation perfectly.
