2008-10-30T15:16:00.000Z	sirMajid		why doesnn't compiz work with laptops with ati graphic card
2008-10-30T15:17:00.000Z	sirMajid		has anybody had the problem with ati graphic card and compiz?
2008-10-30T15:17:00.000Z	sirMajid		can they work together?
2008-10-30T15:17:00.000Z	jim_p	sirMajid	loads of people. atis fglrx is a load of crap for compiz
2008-10-30T15:18:00.000Z	sirMajid	jim_p	what do u mean? they can't work together?
2008-10-30T15:18:00.000Z	jim_p	sirMajid	you can try radeon or radeonhd if you want compiz only and no games.
2008-10-30T15:19:00.000Z	jim_p	sirMajid	they cant work properly together
2008-10-30T15:19:00.000Z	sirMajid	jim_p	is all of the visual effects of ubuntu related to compiz?
2008-10-30T15:20:00.000Z	sirMajid	jim_p	I mean there are no visual effects without compiz?
2008-10-30T15:20:00.000Z	jim_p	sirMajid	yes. compiz = visual effects
2008-10-30T15:20:00.000Z	sirMajid	jim_p	ok...so what do u mean by just compiz and no games?
2008-10-30T15:21:00.000Z	jim_p	sirMajid	radeonhd will give you compiz, but its too weak for games. fglrx is like 5 times more powerfull than radeonhd, but crappy behavior with compiz
2008-10-30T15:23:00.000Z	sirMajid	jim_p	I don't run games on my ubuntu...I guess radeonhd will be ok...how should I install that
2008-10-30T15:23:00.000Z	jim_p	sirMajid	what is your vga?
2008-10-30T15:24:00.000Z	sirMajid	jim_p	ati radeon x600
2008-10-30T15:25:00.000Z	jim_p	sirMajid	http://7g.pri.ee/mine.conf this is my xorg.conf... in case you need fglrx ideas :P
2008-10-30T15:25:00.000Z	jim_p	sirMajid	i dont use compiz and even with the composite options it still freezes!
2008-10-30T15:25:00.000Z	sirMajid	jim_p	no...I already removed fglrx
2008-10-30T15:28:00.000Z	sirMajid	jim_p	when I turn on visual effects, it says "visual effects can't be enabled"
2008-10-30T15:28:00.000Z	jim_p	sirMajid	give me a sec. packages.ubuntu.com is slow
2008-10-30T15:28:00.000Z	sirMajid	jim_p	ok...
