2008-07-26T00:22:00.000Z	NoTownKasper		kenkku: I changed it to work with xscreensaver, and, in a fit of stupidity, deleted it manually when i uninstalled xscreensaver. :D
2008-07-26T00:23:00.000Z	kenkku	NoTownKasper	ah, so no bug there :) glad I could help
2008-07-26T00:24:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	kenkku	One more quick question if you don't mind? You happen to remember the package name for the extra screensavers? The ones commonly reccomended to install when switching to xscreensaver? Half of them crash my system.
2008-07-26T00:25:00.000Z	kenkku	NoTownKasper	would that be xscreensaver-gl-extra or xscreensaver-data-extra?
2008-07-26T00:25:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	kenkku	Possibly...though when i try to unsinstall those, synaptic tries to tell me it's going to uninstall ubuntu desktop. And that kinda worries me.
2008-07-26T00:28:00.000Z	kenkku	NoTownKasper	well, I have xscreensaver-data and xscreensaver-gl installed by default and I've never installed xscreensaver
2008-07-26T00:29:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	kenkku	Hrm, guess I get to forum search for that old guide I followed, and just like, do it backwards. Ok, thanks.
2008-07-26T00:29:00.000Z	kenkku	NoTownKasper	gnome-screensaver seems to recommend those packages
2008-07-26T00:30:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	kenkku	Well, I'm looking for the forum guide right now, but somewhere in it there's a package of non-default screensavers mentioned, and I installed those. Most of which lock my system up hardcore. :\
2008-07-26T00:31:00.000Z	kenkku	NoTownKasper	that would be those -extra packages
2008-07-26T00:32:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	kenkku	So, um, you're telling me that once I installed them, I can't uninstall them?
2008-07-26T00:33:00.000Z	kenkku	NoTownKasper	you should be able to uninstall them
2008-07-26T00:33:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	kenkku	Ok, then help me out, what is it going to remove when it removes 'ubuntu desktop'? Cuz when i try to remove those extra packages via synaptic, it tells me it needs to remove that as well.
2008-07-26T00:34:00.000Z	kenkku	NoTownKasper	could you paste the output of apt-get to pastebin.com for me?
2008-07-26T00:36:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	kenkku	http://pastebin.com/m5f37f344 There it is, but I think that's not likely to be what you're looking for.
2008-07-26T00:36:00.000Z	kenkku	NoTownKasper	the output you get when trying to uninstall the package, I meant. sorry
2008-07-26T00:37:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	kenkku	Aaahhh. I use Synaptic...can I post a screenshot?
2008-07-26T00:37:00.000Z	kenkku	NoTownKasper	when you click apply, what packages does it apply for removal?
2008-07-26T00:39:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	kenkku	I must appologise for wasting your time...I was trying to remove the wrong package...
2008-07-26T00:40:00.000Z	kenkku	NoTownKasper	yeah, that's what I suspected
2008-07-26T00:40:00.000Z	kenkku	NoTownKasper	it's no problem :)
2008-07-26T00:41:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	kenkku	Ok, thanks much. I'll be out of your hair now. Need to help a buddy of mine install ubuntu. :D
