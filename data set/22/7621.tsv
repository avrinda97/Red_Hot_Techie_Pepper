2006-03-25T11:45:00.000Z	CryoTox		Is there a command to set a folder to non-read only?
2006-03-25T11:45:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	chmod ?
2006-03-25T11:51:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	 read on how to use chmod
2006-03-25T11:51:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	 or ask a more specific question
2006-03-25T11:55:00.000Z	CryoTox	FliesLikeABrick	Was that specific enough?
2006-03-25T11:56:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	when you mount the filesystem that is on the mp3 player, you have to tell it to allow people to modify the files, besides root
2006-03-25T11:56:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	how did you mount the filesystem, or was it mounted automatically?
2006-03-25T11:59:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	 sorry, i replied to you but you must have been disconnected by then
2006-03-25T11:59:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	how did you mount the filesystem, or was it mounted automatically?
2006-03-25T12:00:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	 sudo nano /etc/ftsab
2006-03-25T12:01:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	 what device letter is it?
2006-03-25T12:02:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	in /etc/fstab, paste us the one line that says /dev/sda in it
2006-03-25T12:02:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	 only the one line
2006-03-25T12:04:00.000Z	CryoTox	FliesLikeABrick	It isn't in there
2006-03-25T12:05:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	 do sudo nano /etc/fstab and add this line:
2006-03-25T12:05:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	add in the line /dev/sda1 /mnt/mp3 vfat umask=000 0 0
2006-03-25T12:05:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	 also do mkdir /mnt/mp3
2006-03-25T12:07:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	 do umount /dev/sda1 then do mount /dev/sda1
2006-03-25T12:07:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	 you have to do both of those as root, then your mp3  player should be mounted at /mnt/mp3
2006-03-25T12:08:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	CryoTox	 is your mp3 player plugged in?
2006-03-25T12:10:00.000Z	CryoTox	FliesLikeABrick	Just went in and xhanged everything
2006-03-25T12:11:00.000Z	CryoTox	FliesLikeABrick	Still getting the error...
