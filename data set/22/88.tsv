2012-08-07T06:27:00.000Z	sakorty	null1024	btw, do you know how to make league of legends work?  xD
2012-08-07T06:28:00.000Z	null1024	sakorty	no idea, check the winehq database to see if it works in wine
2012-08-07T06:28:00.000Z	sakorty	null1024	well i tried looking on the forum and it said that i have to install wine and winetricks
2012-08-07T06:28:00.000Z	null1024	sakorty	yes
2012-08-07T06:29:00.000Z	sakorty	null1024	ok thanks  ^^
2012-08-07T06:29:00.000Z	null1024	sakorty	wine should install winetricks automatically
2012-08-07T06:29:00.000Z	sakorty	null1024	okay
2012-08-07T06:29:00.000Z	null1024	sakorty	just sudo apt-get install wine-1.4
2012-08-07T06:30:00.000Z	sakorty	null1024	oh i was searching for the download on google  xD
2012-08-07T06:31:00.000Z	null1024	sakorty	there are packages on winehq, but installing it from the repo is easier
2012-08-07T06:31:00.000Z	sakorty	null1024	E: couldn't find any package by regex 'wine-1.4'
2012-08-07T06:32:00.000Z	null1024	sakorty	oh whoops, wine1.4
2012-08-07T06:32:00.000Z	sakorty	null1024	thanks
2012-08-07T07:24:00.000Z	sakorty	null1024	sorry to bother you but i have a small problem with wine1.4
