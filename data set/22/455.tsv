2011-09-22T17:14:00.000Z	Ibis	M^jseongtae76	when messing with ssh, I hope you typed in: yourUsername@ip-or-host.com
2011-09-22T17:14:00.000Z	Ibis		You're welcome.
2011-09-22T17:15:00.000Z	Ibis	M^jseongtae76	Otherwise, without the @username,  it'll pick default user. Like root.  And if the root's password is wrong, an error of failed authencation is morelikely to result.
2011-09-22T17:15:00.000Z	M^jseongtae76	Ibis	ok thanks have a good day
