2006-03-30T17:49:00.000Z	rapha		Hi all!
2006-03-30T17:49:00.000Z	rapha		How do you delete a file that is not there?
2006-03-30T17:50:00.000Z	Matthewv	rapha	????? a file not there.. why do you want to delete it ? :D
2006-03-30T17:50:00.000Z	rapha	Matthewv	because, it's there. Actually I want to remove the whole folder the file is in. But I always get "Error: file not found" when deleting blahblah.blah" (rough translation from the German message)
2006-03-30T17:51:00.000Z	Matthewv	rapha	does the file show up with the command 'ls' ?
2006-03-30T17:51:00.000Z	Matthewv		sry fyrestrtr u beat me to it
2006-03-30T17:54:00.000Z	rapha	Matthewv	yes it does. And rm -f'ing it _seems_ to work, but it doesn't disappear. Actually. ls'ing does NOT work because you just get "ls: ImageBlockSiteAdminAontrollerText.class: File or directory not found".
2006-03-30T17:56:00.000Z	Matthewv	rapha	but does the file show up if you just do a "ls -la" without the filename.. to show all files in the folder...
2006-03-30T17:56:00.000Z	rapha	Matthewv	nope, isn't there then.
2006-03-30T17:57:00.000Z	Matthewv	rapha	so what do you mean by it is there.. where do_does_ the file show up??
2006-03-30T17:57:00.000Z	rapha	Matthewv	in nautilus, and when using tab completion on the command line it shows up.
2006-03-30T17:58:00.000Z	Matthewv	rapha	where was the file from originally??
2006-03-30T17:59:00.000Z	rapha	Matthewv	some old installation of Gallery.
2006-03-30T06:00:00.000Z	rapha	Matthewv	and it surely wasn't named "...Aontroller..." but "...Controller..."
2006-03-30T06:00:00.000Z	Matthewv	rapha	can a "sudo rm -rf <filename>" remove it??
2006-03-30T06:02:00.000Z	rapha	Matthewv	nope. It doesn't change anything. It's still not-there-but-somehow-there after that.
2006-03-30T06:03:00.000Z	Matthewv	rapha	and running that command on the containing folder doesn't help either i suppose..
2006-03-30T06:04:00.000Z	rapha	Matthewv	true. Because rm works recursively.
2006-03-30T06:04:00.000Z	rapha		Seems to work... haven't read the sources.
2006-03-30T06:05:00.000Z	Matthewv	rapha	maybe an issue with permmissions???
2006-03-30T06:06:00.000Z	rapha	Matthewv	how? I used sudo. Plus, the file not showing up in ls should prove there's something wrong...
2006-03-30T06:07:00.000Z	Matthewv	rapha	just guessing here.. :) probly better try someone else.. I can't think of much more...
