2007-04-25T09:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fathefner	That doesn't tell me the chipset, you can find that info in hardware manager or lspci
2007-04-25T09:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fathefner	lspci

2007-04-25T09:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fathefner	I have seen that already
2007-04-25T09:42:00.000Z	Fathefner	Jordan_U	any idea what i should do
2007-06-02T05:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fathefner	Try going to the GRUB menu when you boot and use "e" to edit and remove the "splash" and possibly "quiet" kernel parameters
2007-06-02T05:11:00.000Z	Fathefner	Jordan_U	i just cant boot onto ubuntu
2007-06-02T05:11:00.000Z	Fathefner	Jordan_U	it says some about unix
2007-06-02T05:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fathefner	Removing the splash screen should let you see any error messages you may be getting
2007-06-02T05:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fathefner	Can you be more specific?
2007-06-02T05:20:00.000Z	Fathefner	Jordan_U	it wont boot to the ubuntu log on screen
2007-06-02T05:20:00.000Z	Fathefner	Jordan_U	can i just reinstall
2007-06-02T05:20:00.000Z	Fathefner	Jordan_U	it might help that its a duel boot
2007-06-03T11:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fathefner	Why not just use the Restricted Driver Manager ?
2007-06-03T11:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fathefner	What's not where? :)
2007-06-03T11:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fathefner	Ok, then install them via synaptic / apt, here is a guide:
2007-06-04T07:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Fathefner	Just use these instructions, they do the same thing, just more steps
2007-06-04T07:10:00.000Z	Fathefner	Jordan_U	its a pain in the butt to do it the other way
