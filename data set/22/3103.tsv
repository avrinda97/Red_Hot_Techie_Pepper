2010-10-02T17:04:00.000Z	ManDay		What does Ubuntu use to realize Dual Screen setup?
2010-10-02T17:04:00.000Z	popey	ManDay	depends on the video card
2010-10-02T17:04:00.000Z	popey	ManDay	i use nvidia on my dual-screen desktop, and intel on my dual screen laptop
2010-10-02T17:05:00.000Z	ManDay	popey	What I mean is how does Ubuntu handle dual monitors BY DEFAULT? there is that "monitors" preferencesthing out of the box - what is it? xinerama? twinview? ???
2010-10-02T17:06:00.000Z	popey	ManDay	again, depends on the video card
2010-10-02T17:06:00.000Z	popey	ManDay	twinview is nvidia only
2010-10-02T17:06:00.000Z	ManDay	popey	I know - but ubuntu has something installed by default to get it working , no?
2010-10-02T17:06:00.000Z	popey	ManDay	yes
2010-10-02T17:07:00.000Z	popey	ManDay	that wont do nvidia cards with the binary nvidia driver
2010-10-02T17:07:00.000Z	ManDay	popey	so what is it?
2010-10-02T17:07:00.000Z	popey	ManDay	the nvidia driver installs nvidia-settings which replaces the monitors preferences panel
2010-10-02T17:07:00.000Z	popey	ManDay	that preferences panel is good for non-nvidia machines
2010-10-02T17:07:00.000Z	ManDay	popey	and what is it?
2010-10-02T17:07:00.000Z	popey	ManDay	what is what?
2010-10-02T17:08:00.000Z	popey	ManDay	it doesnt use xinerama here for nvida or intel
2010-10-02T17:08:00.000Z	ManDay	popey	indeed, but what DOES it use?!
2010-10-02T17:08:00.000Z	popey	ManDay	it doesn't "use" anything external
2010-10-02T17:09:00.000Z	popey	ManDay	the driver just supports dual screens out of the box
2010-10-02T17:11:00.000Z	popey	ManDay	some dont even need an xorg.conf
2010-10-02T17:11:00.000Z	popey	ManDay	my laptop has no xorg.conf at all
2010-10-02T17:11:00.000Z	ManDay	popey	well, these days xorg is magic
