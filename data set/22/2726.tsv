2012-01-25T16:43:00.000Z	level09		how to troubleshoot a cronjob?
2012-01-25T16:43:00.000Z	iceroot	level09	like?
2012-01-25T16:44:00.000Z	level09		I am executing  a script
2012-01-25T16:44:00.000Z	iceroot	level09	to see if it runs? to debug the script inside?
2012-01-25T16:44:00.000Z	level09		and it is supposed to log stuff
2012-01-25T16:44:00.000Z	level09		no to see if it runs
2012-01-25T16:44:00.000Z	level09		I added the script to 1 min cron
2012-01-25T16:44:00.000Z	iceroot	level09	less /var/log/syslog
2012-01-25T16:44:00.000Z	level09		aha thanks
2012-01-25T16:44:00.000Z	iceroot	level09	cron logs every start of a task there
2012-01-25T16:45:00.000Z	level09		yeah I can see that , cool thanks
2012-01-25T16:46:00.000Z	level09		now it is clear : Error: bad username; while reading /etc/crontab
2012-01-25T16:50:00.000Z	level09		why is cron unable to find a command while I can execute it when logged as the user ?
2012-01-25T16:51:00.000Z	iceroot	level09	PATH is the answer
2012-01-25T16:51:00.000Z	level09		aha
2012-01-25T16:51:00.000Z	level09		I should specify the full path
2012-01-25T16:51:00.000Z	iceroot	level09	if you type "ping" the system is looking in thr PATH Variable where that command is
2012-01-25T16:51:00.000Z	iceroot	level09	normally ubuntu should set PATH by default when using crontab -e
2012-01-25T16:52:00.000Z	iceroot	level09	but its always a good idea to use full path to commands in cronjobs/scripts
2012-01-25T16:52:00.000Z	level09	iceroot	great, but how do I find the full path to my command ?
2012-01-25T16:52:00.000Z	level09		whereis ?
2012-01-25T16:52:00.000Z	iceroot	level09	"which command"
