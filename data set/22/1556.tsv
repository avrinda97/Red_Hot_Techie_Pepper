2010-05-30T11:55:00.000Z	CaptainTrek		which package is the Adobe flash package?
2010-05-30T11:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CaptainTrek	 see above..
2010-05-30T12:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CaptainTrek	 yes. One way install/run the ntfs-config tool..  other way.. edit fstab as needed
2010-05-30T12:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CaptainTrek	 a proper entry in fstab can do that.
2010-05-30T12:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CaptainTrek	 ntfs-config tool has options to allow it for ntfs/vfat also
2010-05-30T12:55:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	Dr_Willis	 its not mounting or seeing ANY media except for the filesystem
2010-05-30T12:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CaptainTrek	 look at 'sudo fdisk -l' output. if that dosent show the media. then theres bigger issues
2010-05-30T12:56:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	Dr_Willis	 gparted sees the media
2010-05-30T12:57:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	Dr_Willis	 and fdisk sees the media
2010-05-30T12:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CaptainTrek	 then you should be able to either make a fstab entry for it. or use ntfs-config
2010-05-30T12:58:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	Dr_Willis	 ^
2010-05-30T12:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CaptainTrek	 and they are NTFS filesystems?
2010-05-30T13:02:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	Dr_Willis	and for FAT32?
2010-05-30T13:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CaptainTrek	 change ntfs-3g to vfat i belive
2010-05-30T13:05:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	Dr_Willis	 ^^^
2010-05-30T13:05:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	Dr_Willis	 is a reboot needed?
2010-05-30T13:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CaptainTrek	 i have no idea what you are doing exactly
2010-05-30T13:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CaptainTrek	 fstab changes to NOT take affect as soon as you edit the file..
2010-05-30T13:06:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	Dr_Willis	 i turn on the system: it stops automounting devices
2010-05-30T13:06:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	Dr_Willis	 nautilus doesnt even see the devices, only Filesystem
2010-05-30T13:06:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	Dr_Willis	 is something seriously borked...?
2010-05-30T13:07:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	Dr_Willis	this only started happening within the past few hours
