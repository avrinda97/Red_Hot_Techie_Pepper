2007-03-01T15:38:00.000Z	gravemind	BENN92647	hmm, what procedure are you using to install?
2007-03-01T15:40:00.000Z	gravemind	BENN92647	I'm not sure. Could you give me the link to the wiki?
2007-03-01T15:41:00.000Z	gravemind	BENN92647	open snaptic, go to repositories, and add backports
2007-03-01T15:43:00.000Z	gravemind	BENN92647	settings>repositories>internet updates
2007-03-01T15:44:00.000Z	gravemind	BENN92647	ok, search for flash
2007-03-01T15:45:00.000Z	gravemind	BENN92647	the package you want is right in synaptic I think
2007-03-01T15:45:00.000Z	gravemind	BENN92647	look for libflash-mozplugin
2007-03-01T15:46:00.000Z	gravemind	BENN92647	lol, soon enough you'll get the hang of it
2007-03-01T15:50:00.000Z	gravemind	BENN92647	glad to help. are you sure flash works? test it on youtube or something?
2007-03-01T15:50:00.000Z	BENN92647	gravemind	i totally owe you big time
2007-03-01T16:01:00.000Z	gravemind	BENN92647	first make sure you "cd" to the directory said "windowsprogram.exe" lives
2007-03-01T16:06:00.000Z	gravemind	BENN92647	make sure you're in the right directory first, then run wine "program.exe"
2007-03-02T10:13:00.000Z	gravemind	BENN92647	hey what's up?
