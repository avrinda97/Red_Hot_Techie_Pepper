2010-07-01T07:51:00.000Z	LinOOb		ok - Ubuntu Server coming in now and will use Rsync: thank you.
2010-07-01T07:53:00.000Z	LinOOb		I have a bizarre issue, I pull out all hard drives, remove my Win7 drive and try and load Ubuntu to a new drive - for whatever reason I cant get the drive to boot - then I put back in my Windows 7 drive and I get a grub resuce error - now how is that even possible when the Windows 7 drive weas not even in the machine!????
2010-07-01T07:54:00.000Z	xray_tsk	LinOOb	it's because you have grub in MBR of win7's drive.
2010-07-01T07:55:00.000Z	LinOOb		Xray - how in the world can that happen?  I have to run repair cd and type bootrex.ece /fixmbr to correct Win7
2010-07-01T07:56:00.000Z	LinOOb		Xray how would that even happen - the Win 7 drive as not in the machine?
2010-07-01T07:58:00.000Z	xray_tsk	LinOOb	type the nick as it is, please. In other case highlighting does not work.
2010-07-01T07:58:00.000Z	xray_tsk	LinOOb	anyway, when you did install ubuntu, the first bootable drive was win7 drive. Therefore GRUB was installet there.
2010-07-01T07:58:00.000Z	xray_tsk	LinOOb	you can disconnect win7 drive and boot from ubuntu's cd or dvd
2010-07-01T07:59:00.000Z	xray_tsk	LinOOb	as far as I remember it have some repair functions there
2010-07-01T07:59:00.000Z	LinOOb		when I tried to install Ubuntu - the windows 7 drive was out of the machine - I tried to load UBU on a new drive
2010-07-01T07:59:00.000Z	xray_tsk	LinOOb	did you installed GRUB to MBR?
2010-07-01T08:00:00.000Z	xray_tsk	LinOOb	the second thing you should to heck is bootable flag of partitions.
2010-07-01T08:00:00.000Z	xray_tsk	LinOOb	sorry, to check.
2010-07-01T08:00:00.000Z	LinOOb		Xray:  Windows 7 working on drive-pull out drive - put in new drive - boot to live cd - try to install - install fails - remove new drive - put in windows 7 drive again - now win 7 wont boot - error about grub rescue - how in the world is that possible
2010-07-01T08:00:00.000Z	xray_tsk	LinOOb	not to "heck" XD
2010-07-01T08:01:00.000Z	xray_tsk	LinOOb	okay, you really did GRUB installation.
2010-07-01T08:01:00.000Z	LinOOb	edbian	- I think you got it - I did recently enable raid
2010-07-01T08:01:00.000Z	xray_tsk	LinOOb	if the question is to boot win7, you should use fixboot and fixmbr
2010-07-01T08:02:00.000Z	xray_tsk	LinOOb	and check bootable flag.
2010-07-01T08:02:00.000Z	LinOOb		I did fix win 7 my question is why is Grub loading to my raid I guess?  By the way my raid drives are disconnected
2010-07-01T08:02:00.000Z	xray_tsk	LinOOb	it should be set to the win7's service partition (usually ~100 mb)
2010-07-01T08:02:00.000Z	xray_tsk	LinOOb	you grub was installed when you tried installation, that failed.
