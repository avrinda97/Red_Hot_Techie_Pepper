2010-10-10T11:27:00.000Z	Loshki	jimlovell777	can we see the rsync command line you've been using?
2010-10-10T11:31:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Loshki	rsync --inplace --progress /media/original /media/USB/backup
2010-10-10T11:31:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Loshki	original and backup in reality being /src/file.file /dst/file.file
2010-10-10T11:32:00.000Z	Loshki	jimlovell777	I don't see anything wrong with it offhand, I'm checking the man page now, as I'm sure you've done...
2010-10-10T11:33:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Loshki	Yes several times, I don't see any problems either. I'm only trying to update one file, one big file. Google results only show remote examples which don't seem to help either. Is my file too big?
2010-10-10T11:36:00.000Z	Loshki	jimlovell777	I've had the same experience as you. I had a file I wanted to update and I knew it only had certain blocks changed, but rsync didn't seem to generate the small deltas I was hoping for.
2010-10-10T11:37:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Loshki	I wonder if it's a bug. I know RSYNC is supposed to be able to handle small changes and update only what's changed. I've yet to have it work though.
2010-10-10T11:38:00.000Z	Loshki	jimlovell777	I recall experimenting with -B. The man page refers to a 'technical report'. Was there anything at http://rsync.samba.org/
2010-10-10T11:40:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Loshki	Nothing shown that helped. I just experimented with much smaller files and the command I posted a moment ago worked as expected.
2010-10-10T11:42:00.000Z	Loshki	jimlovell777	So, rsync fails just when you need it most. I always meant to chase this up on their message boards but it was a long time ago...
2010-10-10T11:45:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Loshki	 Yep just tried it again with my huge file. Today alone I made a several gig change in the file. I just ran the rsync command and it exited saying total transfered 31 bytes. Clearly something is wrong.
2010-10-10T11:46:00.000Z	Loshki	jimlovell777	very worrying. If I were you, I'd go to their mailing list next...
2010-10-10T11:47:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Loshki	I'm nervous even running the command. I'm afraid it will corrupt my original AND the backup.
2010-10-10T11:49:00.000Z	Loshki	jimlovell777	I understand. Can you make a local backup at all?
2010-10-10T11:50:00.000Z	Loshki	jimlovell777	also, -n, so you can try stuff without doing any actual i/o
2010-10-10T11:51:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Loshki	I can. Being 70GB it just takes a while. If the worst happened I'd only lose things created since yesterday. I keep my backups current. Problem is, until I figure this out I have to wait 30mins for the transfer every few days.
2010-10-10T11:57:00.000Z	Loshki	jimlovell777	can I ask what application it is that generates such large changsets?
2010-10-10T11:58:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Loshki	It's a encrypted Truecrypt volume and I just added several gigs of pictures I took the other day.
2010-10-10T12:00:00.000Z	Loshki	jimlovell777	well, disk space has never been cheaper. In your place, I'd buy a 1.5TB. You can keep a lot of 70G backups on one of those.
2010-10-10T12:02:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Loshki	I have the local copy of the container which I update with customer files, code for my products, site backups, etc.. I then have a USB drive I sync to regularly and then a second USB drive I only update once a month. All of that on top of DVDs which contain any new data to be added so if all of my drives die I can build the container from disc. I just need to work on the off-site part of the solution. :-\
2010-10-10T12:04:00.000Z	Loshki	jimlovell777	sounds like you have it covered. Wish I knew more about rsync. Keep asking. Lots of experts drop in and out on here...
2010-10-10T12:05:00.000Z	jimlovell777	Loshki	lol, I try, I almost literally have all of my eggs in one basket.
