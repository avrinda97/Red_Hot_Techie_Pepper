2009-10-26T06:26:00.000Z	Random832	soreau	right
2009-10-26T06:26:00.000Z	soreau	Random832	You mean tty ie. Ctrl+Alt+F1-6?
2009-10-26T06:26:00.000Z	soreau	Random832	Which graphics driver?
2009-10-26T06:27:00.000Z	Random832	soreau	radeon_drv.so
2009-10-26T06:27:00.000Z	soreau	Random832	and version of ubuntu
2009-10-26T06:29:00.000Z	soreau	Random832	Can you reliably reproduce or does it happen only at a certain time? FWIW, there has been a lot of developments with the radeon driver since 9.04
2009-10-26T06:30:00.000Z	Random832	soreau	it usually happens after i've hibernated at least once
2009-10-26T06:31:00.000Z	soreau	Random832	That sounds about right. There have been a lot of fixes since 9.04 and 9.10 release is right around the corner. If it still is happening after you upgrade to karmic, ask in #radeon
2010-01-04T12:12:00.000Z	soreau	Random832	The terminal output will be roughly faster as the processor speed is higher. afaik, there's no way to slow it down. Set your scrollback in your terminal to a high value so you can scroll back on what was output
2010-12-18T15:12:00.000Z	soreau	Random832	You could run it all as one command; iwconfig $IFACE essid [essid] key [wep key]; dhclient $IFACE
2010-12-18T15:13:00.000Z	soreau	Random832	Alternatively for wpa you would want wpa_supplicant most likely
2010-12-18T15:14:00.000Z	Random832	soreau	what the heck does that have to do with what i said - i wasn't saying download some bleeding-edge program
2010-12-18T15:17:00.000Z	soreau	Random832	My point is that you should gather more information and make less assumptions when doing support
2010-12-18T15:18:00.000Z	Random832	soreau	shove off, it's not like i get paid for this, and it's not like there was any potential for my advice to damage his system
2010-12-18T15:18:00.000Z	Random832	soreau	lol, that's the point i was trying to make about _your_ attitude with "it's not like i get paid for this"
2010-12-18T15:19:00.000Z	soreau	Random832	I am informing you how to make less mistakes. I do not have any attitude
2010-12-18T15:26:00.000Z	Random832	soreau	his interface shows up in iwconfig
2010-12-18T15:26:00.000Z	soreau	Random832	That means nothing. It also worked from his SD card
2010-12-18T15:27:00.000Z	soreau	Random832	ubuntu includes firmware, debian does not include any proprietary firmware
2010-12-18T15:27:00.000Z	Random832	soreau	don't you have to pick it from the restricted driver menu thing though?
2010-12-18T15:27:00.000Z	soreau	Random832	No.
2010-12-18T15:30:00.000Z	soreau	Random832	linux-firmware is installed by default. The only firmware that isnt installed are ones with licensing issues like with bc43xx
