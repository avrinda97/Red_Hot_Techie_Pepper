2008-09-20T21:28:00.000Z	petrele		rxndx:you installed ff in what way
2008-09-20T21:29:00.000Z	rxndx	petrele	I installed ff and tried uninstalling from synaptic, all to no avail
2008-09-20T21:30:00.000Z	petrele	rxndx	did you install ff by apt-get both times or not?
2008-09-20T21:30:00.000Z	rxndx	petrele	no, only through the synaptic package manager
2008-09-20T21:31:00.000Z	petrele	rxndx	maybe there are two firefoxs in difference PATH?
2008-09-20T21:32:00.000Z	petrele	rxndx	try "which firefox"
2008-09-20T21:32:00.000Z	rxndx	petrele	IntuitiveNipple, will try both suggestions
2008-09-20T21:33:00.000Z	rxndx	petrele	it says /usr/bin/firefox
2008-09-20T21:34:00.000Z	petrele	rxndx	then i have no idea. are you sure about the problem
2008-09-20T21:35:00.000Z	rxndx	petrele	thanks for the help
2008-09-20T21:37:00.000Z	petrele	rxndx	maybe you can try "sudo rm -rf `locate firefox`", it can help you remove most files related to firefox, and then reinstall firefox
2008-09-20T21:38:00.000Z	rxndx	petrele	 I will try that now
2008-09-20T21:39:00.000Z	rxndx	petrele	 I ran the command but nothing was found
2008-09-20T21:40:00.000Z	petrele	rxndx	it runs for a while, then it exit with nothing, is it?
2008-09-20T21:40:00.000Z	rxndx	petrele	no...
2008-09-20T21:41:00.000Z	petrele	rxndx	did you turn on the tracker?
2008-09-20T21:41:00.000Z	rxndx	petrele	 no
2008-09-20T21:42:00.000Z	rxndx	petrele	 brb
2008-09-20T21:42:00.000Z	petrele	rxndx	if not, try to replace locate firefox with other cmd which can find the files having firefox in its name
2008-09-20T21:44:00.000Z	rxndx	petrele	 I am reinstalling ff 3.0... will see if it works
2008-09-20T21:45:00.000Z	rxndx	petrele	 thanx ;)
2008-09-20T21:46:00.000Z	petrele	rxndx	you are welcome.
