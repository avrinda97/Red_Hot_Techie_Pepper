2006-10-14T07:45:00.000Z	tarelerulz		I have tried get mplayer use synaptic ,but I don't come up with anything beside kmplayer and it sucks
2006-10-14T07:45:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	enable multiverse
2006-10-14T07:46:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	visit the pages ubotu just said
2006-10-14T07:48:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	post your /etc/apt/sources.list on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and give us a link please
2006-10-14T07:59:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	you only have dapper-backports multiverse, you need dapper multiverse
2006-10-14T08:01:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	'gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list' and add "multiverse" to the end of every line that has universe, but no multiverse
2007-03-09T17:52:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	does "Movie Player" work right now?
2007-09-20T05:08:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	yes, but proprietary stuff like flash and sun's java plugin is not available and will take some work.  I would recommend 32bit unless you know exactly why you need 64bit and don't mind some extra headaches
2007-09-20T05:09:00.000Z	tarelerulz	jrib	, I found out about the flash  today.  I if I could get them to work . I would not care about the extra efforts
2007-12-06T17:33:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	use what you works for you
2008-12-15T22:40:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	maybe dvdbackup
2008-12-15T22:41:00.000Z	tarelerulz	jrib	, i don't want to make on iso . I just want to make an .mkv  , avi .mp4 of it.   No program seems to do that .  That works for me
2008-12-15T22:42:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	I didn't tell you to make an iso
2008-12-15T22:44:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	I told you already what I use and I linked you to the wiki page with a few more options...
2008-12-15T22:45:00.000Z	tarelerulz	jrib	you really use command line program to rip a dvd. I  end up use stuff from trancoder .  I would like to use some gui .  handbrake works well ,but missing some features
2008-12-15T22:46:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	the wiki lists several guis
2008-12-15T22:59:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	sounds like a project waiting to happen :)
2008-12-15T23:01:00.000Z	tarelerulz	jrib	it would not make me so mad if say ormrip working on any of my systems.  The hot part is the site don't really have an fourms or any really infor . The error I get it unknown which is so hot.  Seem if you really want it done with advanced feature . then command is the only way  and put together really rip
2009-08-04T15:26:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	sure but you need to reinstall
2011-09-02T15:18:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	you could just ssh to it
2011-09-02T15:20:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	I don't know if it's your only option
2012-11-15T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	tarelerulz	just ask your real question
