2006-11-15T17:05:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Tomcat_	fool, i already asked my question
2006-11-15T17:05:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Tomcat_	did  you think you're clever with your !ask command?
2006-11-15T17:06:00.000Z	Tomcat_	livingdaylight	Insulting me won't help.
2006-11-15T17:06:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Tomcat_	don't worry, i understand that you are not help, so i'll insult you plent
2006-11-15T17:09:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Tomcat_	!ask
2006-12-29T16:44:00.000Z	Tomcat_	livingdaylight	It will.
2006-12-29T16:45:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Tomcat_	woa, you know this?
2006-12-29T16:45:00.000Z	Tomcat_	livingdaylight	Quite slow if you have *many* windows open, but it will work perfectly.
2006-12-29T16:45:00.000Z	Tomcat_	livingdaylight	Sure, I use it on Intel 855... Intel 950 is only a successor.
2006-12-29T16:46:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Tomcat_	i iz concerned because the man said the lappy doesn't have a dedicated 3-d graphics card. Its integrated graphics. And my desktop pc which has integrated graphics i know doesn't run the cube or and 3-d games or stuff
2006-12-29T16:47:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Tomcat_	looking at lenovo R60e with core duo processor, so a bit of speed there. Aguess memory is the thing
2006-12-29T16:47:00.000Z	Tomcat_	livingdaylight	Yeah, onboard Intel is slow... but it will still work. Think 10 to 20 fps, where NVidia/ATI get about 60+.
2006-12-29T16:48:00.000Z	Tomcat_	livingdaylight	I'm amazed myself that it works so well.
2006-12-29T16:48:00.000Z	Tomcat_	livingdaylight	It also depends much on what effect plugins you run... I'm talking about the default things here.
2006-12-29T16:48:00.000Z	Tomcat_	livingdaylight	If you turn on much of the transparency stuff it's barely usable.
2006-12-29T16:49:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Tomcat_	the world of laptops is a minefield
2006-12-29T16:50:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Tomcat_	but Feisty will run on it
2006-12-29T16:51:00.000Z	Tomcat_	livingdaylight	Yeah, and feisty is currently quite low in effects... runs much better than beryl on edgy.
2006-12-29T16:51:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Tomcat_	is there a btter laptop the Lenovo R60e?
2006-12-29T16:52:00.000Z	Tomcat_	livingdaylight	No idea... I'm not up to speed with laptops. But I'd go with Lenovo as well... good Linux support generally.
