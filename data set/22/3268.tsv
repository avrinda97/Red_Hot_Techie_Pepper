2008-10-28T12:18:00.000Z	ArShAm		Hi all
2008-10-28T12:18:00.000Z	ArShAm		I am about to upgrade with an alternate CD , and it is going to remove lots of my current packages
2008-10-28T12:19:00.000Z	ArShAm		I am a limitted network access and I cannot upgrade all of my packages , what to do?
2008-10-28T12:19:00.000Z	rski	ArShAm	not upgrade or upgrade in small stages.
2008-10-28T12:20:00.000Z	ArShAm	rski	I have to upgrade , because I need to use the new kernel
2008-10-28T12:21:00.000Z	rski		so get someone to download the .debs for you and install them locally
2008-10-28T12:21:00.000Z	rski		that's the only way then if you can't do it yourself
2008-10-28T12:21:00.000Z	ArShAm	rski	 is it possible to bypass the removes?
2008-10-28T12:21:00.000Z	rski		removes?
2008-10-28T12:21:00.000Z	ArShAm		yes
2008-10-28T12:21:00.000Z	rski		removes?
2008-10-28T12:22:00.000Z	ArShAm		it says it needs to get 1400 MBs if I want all the updates
2008-10-28T12:22:00.000Z	rski		ok so? you just update the kernel then.
2008-10-28T12:22:00.000Z	ArShAm	rski	the new kernel is not in hardy repos
2008-10-28T12:22:00.000Z	rski		right so order 8.10 from shipit
2008-10-28T12:23:00.000Z	rski		or download a new kernel from kernel.org and install it manually
2008-10-28T12:23:00.000Z	rski		or get a friend to download it for you
2008-10-28T12:23:00.000Z	ArShAm		ok , thanks anyway
2008-10-28T12:23:00.000Z	rski		so there you go ArShAm
2008-10-28T12:23:00.000Z	rski		loads of options
2008-10-28T12:23:00.000Z	rski		just pick one
2008-10-28T12:24:00.000Z	ArShAm	rski	thanks , bye
