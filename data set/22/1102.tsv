2010-11-13T02:59:00.000Z	goltoof	Benkinooby	 i'm having no luck at all getting mplayer to do what i want in cli.
2010-11-13T02:58:00.000Z	Benkinooby	goltoof	mplayer
2010-11-13T02:58:00.000Z	Benkinooby	goltoof	it can also play videos with framebuffers on the cli
2010-11-13T03:01:00.000Z	Benkinooby	goltoof	what do you want it to do?
2010-11-13T03:02:00.000Z	goltoof	Benkinooby	 i want a 100% terminal based gui-like interface for playing music, and vids if possible
2010-11-13T03:04:00.000Z	Benkinooby	goltoof	hm, don't know if that is possible... didn't hear of it. if you are in cli, it would make things more difficult. to operated mplayer via cli is pretty straigt forward. you can tell it to print the playlist and add songs, chenge volumen and all..
2010-11-13T03:05:00.000Z	Benkinooby	goltoof	if there is one thing i learned is, that most of these progs are made by people that are using them a lot. so they know what works best. it still takes some efforts for me to get rid of the gui-way ;) but it pays off
2010-11-13T03:07:00.000Z	Benkinooby	goltoof	maybe you are looking for pytone? http://www.luga.de/pytone/pytone.png
2010-11-13T03:08:00.000Z	goltoof	Benkinooby	 no doubt gui is easier, but i like to get as many things working in terminal as i can, since that's where i spend most my time... i may not even end up using it, but i still like to try
2010-11-13T03:09:00.000Z	Benkinooby	goltoof	it's called pytone
2010-11-13T03:09:00.000Z	goltoof	Benkinooby	  yea trying thx.   i was looking for instructions on ncmpcpp and gave up :P
2010-11-13T03:11:00.000Z	Benkinooby	goltoof	if you are looking for more cli support you might give channels of distros that have more cli users a try. maybe archlinux, gentoo, debian...
2010-11-13T03:12:00.000Z	goltoof	Benkinooby	  you're right, i am a bit off topic,  but so are most "linux" question here ;)
2010-11-13T03:13:00.000Z	goltoof	Benkinooby	  support for many formats would be nice
2010-11-13T03:14:00.000Z	Benkinooby	goltoof	never mind... i was not correctiong you. i just wanted to say, that you might be more lucky with usable answers in other channels, where more people with cli experience are around
2010-11-13T03:14:00.000Z	goltoof	Benkinooby	 i usually do,  i have yet to find a channel as active and knowledgable as this one tho
2010-11-13T03:14:00.000Z	goltoof	Benkinooby	  and not filled with 12 year old pubks
2010-11-13T03:16:00.000Z	Benkinooby	goltoof	i always found good answers in gentoo channel (if you have some linux experience) and debian. but i have to admit, that the ubuntu channel is the most active one. but if it comes to a certain complexity of question, ubuntu channel might not be the best places. still it's not wrong to ask here ;)
2010-11-13T03:18:00.000Z	Benkinooby	goltoof	try the man command ;)
2010-11-13T03:19:00.000Z	Benkinooby	goltoof	are you using screen, tmux or something like that?
2010-11-13T03:19:00.000Z	goltoof	Benkinooby	can you believe that i actually do man [command] every time i need to learn something??   took me almost a year to pick that up
2010-11-13T03:19:00.000Z	goltoof	Benkinooby	  terminator
