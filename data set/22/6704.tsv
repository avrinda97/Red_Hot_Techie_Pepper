2006-08-16T12:03:00.000Z	mason		Hi fellow ubuntu'ians. I'm having some trouble configuring grub correctly to boot into WinXP on my second SATA HD. I've fdisk'ed to get the correct device, modifed the menu.lst, but when I try to boot XP from grub it fails. Can anyone help me out.

2006-08-16T12:05:00.000Z	Acid___	mason	it's in french but you'll see the same thing in english i think
2006-08-16T12:05:00.000Z	mason	Acid___	 grub doesn't even start to boot into windows, it fails before XP has a chance.
2006-08-16T12:05:00.000Z	Acid___	mason	Yes, i had this problem
2006-08-16T12:05:00.000Z	mason	Acid___	I'll take a look at that. thanks.
2006-08-16T12:05:00.000Z	Acid___	mason	no problem
2006-08-16T12:05:00.000Z	Acid___	mason	the trick is map(hd0)(hd1)
2006-08-16T12:05:00.000Z	Acid___		map(hd1)(hd0)
2006-08-16T12:06:00.000Z	Acid___	mason	this will let windows think it is on the first hard disk
2006-08-16T12:07:00.000Z	mason	Acid___	map (hd0)(hd1) / map (hd1)(hd0) / root (hd1,1) /  chainloader +1
2006-08-16T12:07:00.000Z	mason		correct?
2006-08-16T12:07:00.000Z	Acid___	mason	yep
2006-08-16T12:07:00.000Z	Acid___	mason	root (hd1,0)
2006-08-16T12:08:00.000Z	Acid___	mason	windows is on c: ?
2006-08-16T12:08:00.000Z	Acid___	mason	first partition of your second disk ?
2006-08-16T12:08:00.000Z	mason		Windows XP = /dev/sdb2   *         575       30515   240501082+   7  HPFS/NTFS
2006-08-16T12:09:00.000Z	Acid___	mason	so rootnoverify (hd1,1)
2006-08-16T12:09:00.000Z	Acid___	mason	don't forget the noverify :)
2006-08-16T12:10:00.000Z	mason		Ah, what's the difference between root and rootnoverify, aside from not verifying it?
