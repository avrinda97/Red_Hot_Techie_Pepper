2005-11-07T08:05:00.000Z	DShepherd	aftertaf	srry man
2005-11-07T08:07:00.000Z	DShepherd	aftertaf	its just you did that you posted about e17. I was quite verbose..Looked very bot like
2005-11-07T08:08:00.000Z	DShepherd	aftertaf	ok.
2005-11-27T13:33:00.000Z	aftertaf	DShepherd	 in /etc:init.d   or with bum (boot up manager)
2005-11-27T13:37:00.000Z	DShepherd	aftertaf	so how can I temporarily disable a process?
2005-11-27T13:39:00.000Z	aftertaf	DShepherd	 in the boot up? you either deactivate it or you leave it.... one will make it start on boot, and one will do nothing: you can run it manually... Is it sth you have running on boot you want to disable?
2005-11-27T13:40:00.000Z	DShepherd	aftertaf	whats' sth?
2005-11-27T13:41:00.000Z	aftertaf	DShepherd	 something in lazy keyboard-speak
2005-11-27T13:42:00.000Z	DShepherd	aftertaf	I am moving from windows to linux, new to ubuntu. using it for a month now or so.. i just want to know to do the things I can do in windows... and one of them is tweaking my boottime
2005-11-27T13:44:00.000Z	aftertaf	DShepherd	 hehe  i get ya ;). but beware of comparing all in linux to windows, a lot of things are just different.....    someone gave me a link to apage that really explained things very well in that way.
2005-11-27T13:44:00.000Z	DShepherd	aftertaf	yeah i know....
2005-11-27T13:45:00.000Z	DShepherd	aftertaf	like for example, I like this windows app clipomatic. quite nice, It stores clipboard entries... where can I get one for ubuntu
