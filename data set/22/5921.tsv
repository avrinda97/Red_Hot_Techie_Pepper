2007-01-21T17:44:00.000Z	mmdollar		Hello people can anyone help me ? it's for the first time for me to install Unbuntu when I get to part 5 (the section to select a partition to install Ubuntu) the screen shows me that all my hard drive is a unallocated
2007-01-21T17:45:00.000Z	mmdollar		judicata well yea I expected to see sda1 sda5 and 3 :)
2007-01-21T17:45:00.000Z	Judicata	mmdollar	is XP on the disk?
2007-01-21T17:44:00.000Z	Judicata	mmdollar	If you expected to see something else on your HD..that's bad news.
2007-01-21T17:47:00.000Z	mmdollar	Judicata	can you point to me somekind of link to see how can I resolve my problem or something
2007-01-21T17:48:00.000Z	Judicata	mmdollar	do you have XP on the drive?
2007-01-21T17:48:00.000Z	mmdollar	Judicata	yes on sda1 and I use sda5 for movies and games
2007-01-21T17:51:00.000Z	Judicata	mmdollar	you still here?
2007-01-21T17:51:00.000Z	mmdollar	Judicata	yes
2007-01-21T17:51:00.000Z	Judicata	mmdollar	so, do you have XP or another OS on the disk, and will that OS still boot?
2007-01-21T17:52:00.000Z	mmdollar	Judicata	yes I've XP
2007-01-21T17:52:00.000Z	Judicata	mmdollar	and will it boot?
2007-01-21T17:53:00.000Z	Judicata	mmdollar	and I guess the partitions are invisible if you just open up gparted from the live cd?
2007-01-21T17:54:00.000Z	mmdollar	Judicata	there are visible from gparted
2007-01-21T17:55:00.000Z	Judicata	mmdollar	but, not from the installer??
2007-01-21T17:55:00.000Z	mmdollar	Judicata	yes :(
2007-01-21T17:55:00.000Z	Judicata	mmdollar	so, you go to manually edit the partition table, and it shows that the whole thing is unallocated?
2007-01-21T17:55:00.000Z	mmdollar	Judicata	yeap that's right
2007-01-21T17:57:00.000Z	Judicata	mmdollar	but the partitions are visible when you open up gparted. So, just to make sure I understand, this means you haven't completed the installation process right?
2007-01-21T17:59:00.000Z	Judicata	mmdollar	sorry, hopefully someone else can figure this out.
2007-01-21T06:06:00.000Z	mmdollar	Judicata	hey dude it works now :)
2007-01-21T06:52:00.000Z	mmdollar	Judicata	are you here? :)
