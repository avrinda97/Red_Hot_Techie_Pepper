2007-12-16T07:26:00.000Z	Pelo	Yoakim	usb printer ?
2007-12-16T07:26:00.000Z	Pelo	Yoakim	did you install the driver yourself or did gutsy autorecognise it ?
2007-12-16T07:28:00.000Z	Pelo	Yoakim	go into menu >system >admin > printers,  delete all the printers that might be there
2007-12-16T07:29:00.000Z	Pelo	Yoakim	then go into menu > system > prefs> removable media,  on the last tab I thnk make sure the detect printer box is checkec,  then replug thepinrter power it up an dsee what happens
2007-12-16T07:34:00.000Z	Yoakim	Pelo	Ok, so I get a new printerr installed nice and all, but the problems remain. As I try to print anything using this printer (such as a test page) I just get status stopped...
2007-12-16T07:35:00.000Z	Pelo	Yoakim	right click or dbl click the icon in the pannel,  see if the print job is stoped, paused or someting, try rightlicking to restart it
2007-12-16T07:35:00.000Z	Pelo	Yoakim	did it find the correct driver that matches your printer or only a similar one ?
2007-12-16T07:37:00.000Z	Yoakim	Pelo	I can only abort (cancel) the job, the other options are greyed out... the status of the job is. "Stopped"
2007-12-16T07:38:00.000Z	Pelo	Yoakim	are you sure your printer is properly setup, with paper and ink and the paper properly alinged and stuff ?
2007-12-16T07:38:00.000Z	Yoakim	Pelo	Yes, It works like a charm on other OS'...
2007-12-16T07:39:00.000Z	Pelo	Yoakim	ok , try setting up the printer from the printer manager thingy in system > admin > printer,  as a new printer, see if you can set it up better that way
2007-12-16T07:39:00.000Z	Pelo	Yoakim	what model printer is this ?
2007-12-16T07:40:00.000Z	Yoakim	Pelo	Epson Stylus PHOTO 830
2007-12-16T07:40:00.000Z	Pelo	Yoakim	ok those are parts of cups,  I was wondering it it might have been hp , they seem to have extra stuff to work with
2007-12-16T07:42:00.000Z	Yoakim	Pelo	Ok, so I have the choice between four versions: 1 Epson Stylus Photo 830 - CUPS+Gutenprint v5.0.1 (recommended)
2007-12-16T07:43:00.000Z	Yoakim	Pelo	the other three are Simplified, Simplified and [blank] instead of recommended
2007-12-16T07:44:00.000Z	Pelo	Yoakim	use the recommended wones
2007-12-16T07:49:00.000Z	Yoakim	Pelo	Sorry, I'm not getting anywhere with this and I think I'll have to call it a night... Thanks though for taking the time...
2007-12-16T07:49:00.000Z	Pelo	Yoakim	best of luck
