2011-04-08T09:20:00.000Z	Khisanth	Jon--	you want both at the same time with the panel set to auto hide?
2011-04-08T09:21:00.000Z	Jon--	Khisanth	Yes. My only requirement is that maximized windows don't hide my conky. if I have to hard-code a y-offset, so be it, the vertical length of this conkyrc should never change from where it is now..
2011-04-08T09:53:00.000Z	Khisanth	Jon--	so how are you planning to fix it? :)
2011-04-08T09:58:00.000Z	Jon--	Khisanth	I've been trying to create a zero-space panel in conky and have it reserve the space to print the info normally.
2011-04-08T09:58:00.000Z	Jon--	Khisanth	no luck thusfar though
2011-04-08T10:01:00.000Z	Khisanth	Jon--	can't you just have conky as one bar and then the panel as another bar below it with?
2011-04-08T10:02:00.000Z	Jon--	Khisanth	That may work, however how can I get the gnome-panel to go right below? When I click and drag it has to go quite a bit down my screen, can't seem to move it just a little bit
2011-04-08T10:03:00.000Z	Khisanth	Jon--	that would require some digging
2011-04-08T10:03:00.000Z	Jon--	Khisanth	Haha. ;).
2011-04-08T10:06:00.000Z	Khisanth	Jon--	are you trying that with window_mode set to panel?
2011-04-08T10:06:00.000Z	Jon--	Khisanth	yeah.
2011-04-08T10:07:00.000Z	Jon--	Khisanth	That's the issue is that window_mode set to panel block gnome_panel
2011-04-08T10:14:00.000Z	Khisanth	Jon--	but if it's under that shouldn't be a problem
2011-04-08T10:15:00.000Z	Jon--	Khisanth	Agreed but how do I set the Y axis of the gnome panel in a text file? Click and drag moves it a LARGE distance the first time it moves.
2011-04-08T11:18:00.000Z	Khisanth	Jon--	for building stuff you usually need the -dev package as well
2011-04-08T11:18:00.000Z	Khisanth	Jon--	also apt-get build-dep <name of conky package>
2011-04-08T11:19:00.000Z	Jon--	Khisanth	There is no conky package for 1.8.1
2011-04-08T11:19:00.000Z	Jon--	Khisanth	Which is where this dependency was added.
2011-04-08T11:21:00.000Z	Jon--	Khisanth	It was package liblua5.1-0-dev  thanks anyway.
2011-04-08T11:21:00.000Z	Khisanth	Jon--	needing -dev still applies :)
2011-04-08T11:23:00.000Z	Khisanth	Jon--	you could be that someone! since you are going to build it anyway
2011-04-08T11:24:00.000Z	Jon--	Khisanth	How do I build a .deb?
