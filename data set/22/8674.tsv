2007-05-05T10:06:00.000Z	mario_	zie	thanks. the thing is, the sreen goes black and I can't do a thing
2007-05-05T10:06:00.000Z	mario_	zie	I have my nvidia drivers installed
2007-05-05T10:08:00.000Z	mario_	zie	yes. the sounds are there but the images are not. and since tremulous is a full screen game I can't do a thing
2007-05-05T10:09:00.000Z	mario_	zie	i don't know exactly, you tell me
2007-05-05T10:09:00.000Z	mario_	zie	I installed the os myself
2007-05-05T10:15:00.000Z	mario_	zie	still there?
2007-05-05T10:17:00.000Z	mario_	zie	I started the game but, as the screen went black I couldn't controll anything so I had to ctr+alt+backspace to restart the graphics
2007-05-05T10:20:00.000Z	mario_	zie	i don't think is the game because that happens with other two
2007-05-05T10:20:00.000Z	mario_	zie	but thanks anyway
