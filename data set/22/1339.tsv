2010-06-20T07:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	moatbuilders	stop being silly, when they want support!
2010-06-20T07:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	moatbuilders	unless maybe the other person, is a total idiot, which isn't the case here

2010-06-20T07:37:00.000Z	moatbuilders	sebsebseb	A music player plugin for some player that ive not heard of for 20 years, and i test most new software
2010-06-20T07:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	moatbuilders	well you are being a bit like one at the moment, maybe :D
2010-06-20T07:39:00.000Z	moatbuilders	sebsebseb	I think you see my questioning though.
2010-06-20T07:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	moatbuilders	if you want some just well messing around a bit or whatever try #ubuntu-offtopic
2010-06-20T07:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	moatbuilders	and you should only really type in here, if your going to be helpful when helping others, or have a problem yourself
2010-06-20T07:41:00.000Z	moatbuilders	sebsebseb	I tried to tell you that every question cannot, and should not be answered by you or anyone else in this channel. I thought that question was clearly out of bounds. I could be wrong, but i doubt it.
2010-06-20T07:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	moatbuilders	which question?
2010-06-20T07:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	moatbuilders	and yes not all questions can be answered in this channel
2010-06-20T07:42:00.000Z	moatbuilders	sebsebseb	Its only natural
2010-06-20T07:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	moatbuilders	however what I said before, really we shoudn't type in here, unless its helping someone else,  or  our own issue with Ubuntu
2010-06-20T07:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	moatbuilders	Stop trolling already!
2010-06-20T07:45:00.000Z	moatbuilders	sebsebseb	Trying to help you help others should not be called trolling. Never the less. Ill part and fend off evils as i wish.
2010-06-20T07:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	moatbuilders	except you werne't being helpful with wireshark
2010-06-20T07:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	moatbuilders	and some sillyness about a game as well?
