2007-09-26T15:53:00.000Z	Marfi		anyone messed w/ the new version of ubuntu?
2007-09-26T15:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Marfi	most of the people in #ubuntu+1
2008-04-23T18:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Marfi	we don't need to see that
2008-05-30T20:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Marfi	64 cores per smp kernel I think
2008-05-30T20:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Marfi	you can go beyond that with patches
2008-12-15T13:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Marfi	what video card do you have
2008-12-15T13:00:00.000Z	Marfi	ikonia	its an nvidia go 6100. installed nvidia-glx-177 through terminal, and still doesn't help
2008-12-15T13:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Marfi	force the xorg driver to use vesa or "nv" to see if that makes a difference
2008-12-15T13:01:00.000Z	Marfi	ikonia	would have, but can't edit xorg. they made it "edit free" this release
2008-12-15T13:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Marfi	edit free ?
2008-12-15T13:02:00.000Z	Marfi	ikonia	so you didn't need to edit the xorg. if you do a new install, the xorg file is extremely short. ill double check
2008-12-15T13:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Marfi	that doesn't mean it's not editable
2008-12-15T13:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Marfi	that means it's dynamic unless you put an edit in
2008-12-15T13:04:00.000Z	Marfi	ikonia	i am such an idiot....thank you. =)
2008-12-15T13:05:00.000Z	Marfi	ikonia	what was happened is that most of the xorg files are skimmed down, not showing drivers
2008-12-15T13:06:00.000Z	Marfi	ikonia	if i modify the xorg.conf file, will it stay with an xserver update?
2008-12-15T13:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Marfi	yup
2008-12-15T13:07:00.000Z	Marfi	ikonia	ty. looks like i get to re-write this guy's xorg.conf. =)
2009-02-19T19:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Marfi	nice find
2009-02-19T19:09:00.000Z	Marfi	ikonia	freegoo My fiance's Mac HDD crashed, 60 gigs of her software gone. So I spent 3 days in Linux + HFS. =)
2009-02-19T19:09:00.000Z	Marfi	ikonia	was able to pull it off, though
2009-02-19T19:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Marfi	good info to know
