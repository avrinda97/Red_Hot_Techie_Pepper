2006-03-27T07:16:00.000Z	Healot		see if sane is sane enough to detect your scanner
2006-03-27T07:18:00.000Z	Healot		you could recompile the kernel with the Syscan driver patch...
2006-03-27T07:19:00.000Z	Healot		only TravelScan 460/464 is support by sane, atm, i think
2006-03-27T07:20:00.000Z	Healot		maybe.... that's a good idea
2006-03-27T07:20:00.000Z	Healot		make sure your wine has twain driver support
2006-03-27T07:22:00.000Z	Healot		http://www.sane-project.org/lists/sane-mfgs-cvs.html#Z-SYSCAN >> still unsupported by sane, perezidentt
2006-03-27T07:22:00.000Z	Healot		sure
2006-03-27T07:23:00.000Z	Healot		does rt2500 hardware support WAP?
2006-03-27T07:23:00.000Z	Healot		or it's for the old WEP...
2006-03-27T07:23:00.000Z	Aklys	Healot	it supposedly does.
2006-03-27T07:24:00.000Z	Aklys	Healot	I'm not sure if it does. I can enter the information into /etc/network/interfaces and it shows it in iwconfig. But when I ifup eth1 it falls can't ping anything bar itself
2006-03-27T07:25:00.000Z	Healot	Aklys	maybe it just doesn't do WAP well...
2006-03-27T07:25:00.000Z	Aklys	Healot	How do you distinguish if it doesn't do WPA well
2006-03-27T07:26:00.000Z	Aklys	Healot	all I know is that it can't ping outside of itself. IT doesn't show any other errors.
2006-03-27T07:29:00.000Z	Aklys	Healot	and it works fine on a windows installation. Just can't get it to function on linux
2006-03-27T07:29:00.000Z	Healot	Aklys	can you connect to AP without WAP?
2006-03-27T07:29:00.000Z	Aklys	Healot	considering I'm currently connected among other workstations to it. No I wouldn't be able to do it without WPA.
2006-03-27T07:30:00.000Z	Healot	Aklys	btw, I don't have rt2500 hardware... just a good infor before actually buying any wifi hardware
2006-03-27T07:31:00.000Z	Aklys	Healot	I knew it worked with WEP out of the box. But read it was easy to configure WPAPSK on it too. But did the configuration and it just doesn't work.
