2007-04-29T06:09:00.000Z	strabes		it's def not line-ux
2007-04-29T06:09:00.000Z	strabes		it's linn-icks
2007-04-29T06:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	strabes	wasn't the guy who came up with Linux, his name was Linus, right?.. like Line-us
2007-04-29T06:10:00.000Z	strabes	IndyGunFreak	Linus Torvalds
2007-04-30T06:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	strabes	i think he needs to change it from KDE, but i'm not sure how to do that
2007-04-30T06:58:00.000Z	strabes	IndyGunFreak	Zeion: what exactly is the problem?
2007-04-30T06:59:00.000Z	strabes	IndyGunFreak	Zeion: Is your BOOTSPLASH the kubuntu one?
2007-04-30T06:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	strabes	he installed KDE, and it apparently has disabled(or deleted?) a custom login screen he had
2007-04-30T07:00:00.000Z	strabes	IndyGunFreak	the problem is that when he installed kubuntu, he chose to use kdm (instead of gdm) as the default
2007-04-30T07:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	strabes	thats why i suggested he log in to KDE and fix his problem
2007-04-30T07:01:00.000Z	strabes	IndyGunFreak	he should just remove the kdm package
2007-04-30T07:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	strabes	probably
2007-04-30T07:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	strabes	regardless, KDE is about as close as the average Linux user can get to a virus...lol
2007-04-30T07:02:00.000Z	strabes	IndyGunFreak	I use kde. It's more powerful than gnome
2007-04-30T07:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	strabes	i'd rather have my face stomped on with golf cleats
2007-04-30T07:03:00.000Z	strabes	IndyGunFreak	sorry about that. KDE has options to place & size windows on creation which saves me a lot of time
2007-04-30T07:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	strabes	yeah, thats a nice feature, but i can't handle the crayon book look of it.
2007-04-30T07:04:00.000Z	strabes	IndyGunFreak	what? the shiny icons?
2007-04-30T07:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	strabes	the default, i don't mess with KDE to know themes, etc.
2007-04-30T07:05:00.000Z	strabes	IndyGunFreak	oh. imo amarok is a wonderful music program
2007-04-30T07:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	strabes	i use some KDE apps, for instance, KTorrent..
2007-04-30T07:06:00.000Z	strabes	IndyGunFreak	ok
