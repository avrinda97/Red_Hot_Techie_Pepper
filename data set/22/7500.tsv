2006-03-18T07:39:00.000Z	fluxt	nickrud	i wonder if they'll promptly release a new ubuntu cd image
2006-03-18T07:40:00.000Z	nickrud	fluxt	there are all sorts of implications, I wouldn't even presume to have an opinion
2006-03-18T07:40:00.000Z	fluxt	nickrud	lol perhaps they'll grep their next release for passwords before they release it :)
2006-03-18T07:42:00.000Z	nickrud	fluxt	I was a half-assed programmer once, I can relate.

2006-03-20T16:01:00.000Z	fluxt	nickrud	you are but i was thinking more command history
2006-03-20T16:01:00.000Z	nickrud	fluxt	yeah, as my memory had it, the command history is in there
2006-03-20T16:05:00.000Z	nickrud	fluxt	sure, with an editor. doesn't make sense to do it though, it
2006-03-20T16:05:00.000Z	fluxt	nickrud	cannot write file (using vi)
2006-03-20T16:06:00.000Z	nickrud	fluxt	only as root
2006-03-21T07:54:00.000Z	nickrud	fluxt	linux-source-2.6.12
2006-03-21T07:57:00.000Z	fluxt	nickrud	gah.. apparently.. apt-cache dump | grep linux-source ..works better than.. apt-cache search linux-source
