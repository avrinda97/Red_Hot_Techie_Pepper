2006-05-23T06:05:00.000Z	wims		does anybody know of a good howto on dual head with ATI 9600xt ?
2006-05-23T06:06:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	wims	does 'sudo aptitude install xorg-driver-fglrx && sudo aticonfig --initial=dual-head --screen-layout=left' work?
2006-05-23T06:07:00.000Z	wims	RandolphCarter	 didn't know of that, trying now
2006-05-23T06:13:00.000Z	wims	RandolphCarter	 after running that apt-get command for dual head i get this message : sudo: aticonfig: command not found
2006-05-23T06:14:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	wims	ahh, are you running dapper or breezy?
2006-05-23T06:14:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	wims	make a copy of /etc/X11/xorg.conf in your home directory and run 'sudo fglrxconfig'
2006-05-23T06:14:00.000Z	wims	RandolphCarter	64 bits breezy, dunno if that's relevant
2006-05-23T06:15:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	wims	the config tool for ATI is a bit improved in dapper :)
2006-05-23T06:15:00.000Z	wims	RandolphCarter	 i did a dist-upgrade from hoary to badger yesteday, do you think it's better to upgrade to dapper ?
2006-05-23T06:15:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	wims	not better, just different :)
2006-05-23T06:16:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	wims	you can get it to work in Breezy too, the combined effort of upgrading to Dapper and configuring the card is probably greater
2006-05-23T06:22:00.000Z	wims	RandolphCarter	hmmm that didn't work :(
2006-05-23T06:22:00.000Z	wims	RandolphCarter	 still the same on both monitors
2006-05-23T06:22:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	wims	hmm, did fglrxconfig finish okay? (and did you select all of the dual-head stuff?)
2006-05-23T06:23:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	wims	if you did that okay, do 'ls /etc/X11' and see if there's a file named XF86Config or XF86Config-4
2006-05-23T06:25:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	wims	bingo :) unless that's the copy you made, copy it over /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-05-23T06:26:00.000Z	wims	RandolphCarter	the one in etc/x11 is the most recent one
2006-05-23T06:27:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	wims	ah :/ what happens if you 'grep fglrx /etc/X11/xorg.conf'?
2006-05-23T06:27:00.000Z	wims	RandolphCarter	xorg.conf contains that word
2006-05-23T06:30:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	wims	hmm, that's all I can really walkthrough, http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=423584 is good, when the forums come back
2006-05-23T06:30:00.000Z	wims	RandolphCarter	 ok thanks
2006-05-26T06:52:00.000Z	wims	RandolphCarter	ok, thanks. I guess i have to look into it then
