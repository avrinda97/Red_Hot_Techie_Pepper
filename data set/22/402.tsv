2011-10-24T08:48:00.000Z	pipalo		?
2011-10-24T08:49:00.000Z	pipalo		Good time Peeps !
2011-10-24T08:49:00.000Z	pipalo		How can I re-generate the network-manager config files in ubuntu ?
2011-10-24T08:50:00.000Z	qin	pipalo	By restarting network-manager most likely.
2011-10-24T08:53:00.000Z	pipalo	qin	I have managed to remove everything in /etc/networking/*  like if-down.d if-post-down.d and everything there !
2011-10-24T08:54:00.000Z	qin	pipalo	Do you have still connection?
2011-10-24T08:55:00.000Z	pipalo	qin	ironically yes! when but when ever I try /etc/init.d/networking  start/stop I get error, and at startup it takes too long setting the newtorking configuration and then says waiting for 60 more seconds...
2011-10-24T08:56:00.000Z	qin	pipalo	Good, 1. sudo apt-get install --reinstall network-manager
2011-10-24T08:57:00.000Z	pipalo	qin	reinstall will just use remove, not purge so it wouldn't even touch the config files, I tried it, didn't work. :(
2011-10-24T08:58:00.000Z	qin	pipalo	But reinstall will unpack deb once more
2011-10-24T08:59:00.000Z	qin	pipalo	So all what you have removed and do belong to network-manager will be replaced
2011-10-24T08:59:00.000Z	pipalo	qin	maybe, but even after doing that it's still missing the files.
2011-10-24T09:00:00.000Z	qin	pipalo	No worries, first you need to be able to restart network-manager
2011-10-24T09:08:00.000Z	pipalo	qin	thanks for the help, but how would I restart the network-manager ?
2011-10-24T09:08:00.000Z	pipalo		sudo restart network-manager failed.
2011-10-24T09:08:00.000Z	qin	pipalo	sudo service network-maneger restart (or just start)
2011-10-24T09:09:00.000Z	pipalo	qin	the restart command, 'restart network-manager' and also start/stop same thing.
2011-10-24T09:10:00.000Z	qin	pipalo	sudo service network-maneger status?
2011-10-24T09:11:00.000Z	pipalo	qin	network-manager: stop/waiting.
2011-10-24T09:12:00.000Z	pipalo	qin	and yet I can user internet !
2011-10-24T09:12:00.000Z	qin	pipalo	10 minutes. Need to tidy something.
2011-10-24T09:13:00.000Z	pipalo	qin	aight
