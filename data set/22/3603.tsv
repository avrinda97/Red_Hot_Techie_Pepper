2008-07-23T14:31:00.000Z	Vezir		why is it that ubuntu messes up every time i use it?
2008-07-23T14:31:00.000Z	Vezir		i had it running great
2008-07-23T14:31:00.000Z	Vezir		then i enable desktop effects and it screws up, even though it was fine when i did that on livecd
2008-07-23T14:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Vezir	are you logging on as root?
2008-07-23T14:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Vezir	good, in what way does it screw up?
2008-07-23T14:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Vezir	do you have 2 graphics cards in your system now?
2008-07-23T14:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Vezir	ok, have you disabled the onboard in your bios?
2008-07-23T14:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Vezir	ok well as long as its disabled in some way thats cool
2008-07-23T14:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Vezir	cool, that may help, always fully update before asking :D
2008-07-23T14:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Vezir	as long as your system doesnt see the onboard its fine, 1 less complication
2008-07-23T14:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Vezir	should be fine, depends on your needs
2008-07-23T14:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Vezir	i run an onboard gefore 6150 and it does me fine
2008-07-23T14:53:00.000Z	Vezir	ActionParsnip	setting the bios setting to agp made neither the onboard video nor the pci card work
2008-07-23T14:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Vezir	ok get a display and boot as normal, run lspci and make sure you only have 1 graphics card
2008-07-23T15:01:00.000Z	Vezir	ActionParsnip	it was a gift used computer from a friend
2008-07-24T16:56:00.000Z	Vezir	ActionParsnip	 i got it to work again! one problem though, i can't go to 1600x1200 now. just 1280x960. if i go higher i get screwed up stuff in the background and it only uses 1280x960 space
2008-07-24T17:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Vezir	you need to edit xorg.conf to get the resolutions
2008-07-25T14:48:00.000Z	Vezir	ActionParsnip	do you just sit in here waiting to help people? you're alweays right on a problem when it arises.
2008-07-25T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Vezir	when work is quiet i help, its my contribution for the community. Kinda like paying for my OS with help
2008-07-25T14:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Vezir	ubuntu isnt about that. Its UI is good or new users
2008-07-25T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Vezir	its a simple app, its not pretty but it works
