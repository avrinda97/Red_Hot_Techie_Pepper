2008-07-03T21:28:00.000Z	andersfeder		is it possible to use virtualization on any type of processor, for e.g. running Windows games on Ubuntu?
2008-07-03T21:30:00.000Z	andersfeder		thanks, i know about WINE .. it just don't thinks its an ideal solution .. i was wondering if virtualization could give near 100% compatibility for a gamer
2008-07-03T21:31:00.000Z	andersfeder		oh i see
2008-07-03T21:32:00.000Z	ASULutzy	andersfeder	Wine works for a lot of the most popular games
2008-07-03T21:34:00.000Z	ASULutzy	andersfeder	Nah, not at all, two quick commands in the command line and all you need to do is update and upgrade as normal and it will pull down the newest wine's
2008-07-03T21:34:00.000Z	andersfeder	ASULutzy	yeah, thats what i'm talking about .. not a solution for the general populace
2008-07-03T21:35:00.000Z	ASULutzy	andersfeder	All you have to do is copy and paste two lines? after that the .exe's work just like in windows by double clicking
2008-07-03T21:36:00.000Z	ASULutzy	andersfeder	wget -q http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/387EE263.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add - && sudo wget http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/sources.list.d/hardy.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/winehq.list
2008-07-03T21:36:00.000Z	ASULutzy	andersfeder	Once you do that you'll never have to worry about it again ;)
2008-07-03T21:37:00.000Z	ASULutzy	andersfeder	Gaming does work out of the box. Installing Windows applications in Linux doesn't, for obvious reasons. If you are incapable of copy pasting then you'll have a very rough time on any operating system, Windows, Linux, Mac, doesn't matter.
2008-07-03T21:39:00.000Z	andersfeder	ASULutzy	aw, come on .. dont oversimply things to make Linux look something it isnt .. you know as well as i that ordinary people need to walk a long distance before getting to the point of even having the commands to copy-paste
2008-07-03T21:40:00.000Z	ASULutzy	andersfeder	Normal people=morons? All I did was google how to install wine, and it gave me those two commands to copy paste. It's really not some kind of tricky sorcery like you're making it out to be.
2008-07-03T21:40:00.000Z	ASULutzy	andersfeder	I consider normal people people capable of using a search engine, that's really not asking that much ;)
2008-07-03T21:41:00.000Z	ASULutzy	andersfeder	and I'm saying that if you think it's asking too much for someone to type something into google and copy and paste the result, then those people probably aren't going to do so well on any OS. So it's not really a linux problem
2008-07-03T21:42:00.000Z	ASULutzy	andersfeder	Well, if they'd come in here and ask, or go to the forums, or I don't know, try to better themselves in any way whatsoever? That's like saying how are people supposed to use a search engine? They aren't born witht hat knowledge.
2008-07-03T21:43:00.000Z	andersfeder	ASULutzy	people are trained to use search engines in school or at their job .. they arent trained to know some obscure command for an OS that only a fraction of them will ever user
2008-07-03T21:43:00.000Z	ASULutzy	andersfeder	You're being asinine. We're born knowing how to breathe, anything else is a bonus. No one is born being a masterful programmer, you ask questions, you learn, you adapt. It's not a Linux issue. What's the difference in asking people to learn how Windows works versus learning how Linux works?
2008-07-03T21:44:00.000Z	ASULutzy	andersfeder	This is getting really off topic, m-c, I didn't tell him to just google it. I gave him the commands he would have to enter to set wine up properly and he said that no one would be able to understand that and said wah wah Windows isn't Linux... why don't native Windows binaries work in Linux? Gee, I wonder why they don't.
2008-07-03T21:44:00.000Z	andersfeder	ASULutzy	windows knowledge is forced upon people from everywhere .. linux knowledge isnt .. thats the huge difference
2008-07-03T21:46:00.000Z	ASULutzy	andersfeder	You're argument basically amounts to, "I don't understand it, and I don't want to learn it so I don't like it." If you used that policy throughout life you'd never learn to do anything other than eat and breathe. It's a total straw man argument and an asinine one at that. If you want to continue this silly debate, feel free to PM me for more information ;)
2008-07-03T21:47:00.000Z	ASULutzy	andersfeder	You're really just trolling at this point
2008-07-03T21:48:00.000Z	andersfeder	ASULutzy	no, im not .. thats not for you to decide .. im just laying out the facts .. but lets cut it here
