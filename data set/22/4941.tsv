2009-01-08T05:58:00.000Z	gogereaver	lusepuster	if using a cable miodem without a roughter you need to power cycle them when you install a new os it will then toss out the ip
2009-01-08T05:59:00.000Z	lusepuster	gogereaver	it does indeed seem like it's a cable modem not a router (blush)
2009-01-08T05:59:00.000Z	gogereaver	lusepuster	then do a power cycle pc off modem unplugged for abought a minut them power up the modem and start linux
2009-01-08T06:00:00.000Z	gogereaver		it should give out a ip

You mean, power off the pc and then unplug the cable modem, thenm plug in the cable modem and turn on the pc? Or should I onplug the cable modem from tyhe wall or from the computer?

2009-01-08T06:07:00.000Z	lusepuster	gogereaver	no, exactly. I never used cable modem before, and mistook it for a router. But I hope this works. Thanks, and bye!
