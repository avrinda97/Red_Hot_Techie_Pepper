2006-09-17T14:50:00.000Z	pitapiti		hi all, im having issues making my new graphics card work under x using the nvidia drivers...
2006-09-17T14:50:00.000Z	CromagDK	pitapiti	what seems to be the problem ?
2006-09-17T14:51:00.000Z	pitapiti	CromagDK	it doesnt seems like the nvidia drivers are loaded because i dont get the splashscreen, and also the resolution is 640x480 although my config states 1280x1024...
2006-09-17T14:52:00.000Z	CromagDK	pitapiti	and you used the guide from ubuntuguide ?
2006-09-17T14:52:00.000Z	pitapiti	CromagDK	it seems like the card isnt recognized correctly... the other one was recognized perfectly but it one just says "unknown nvidia card"
