2010-03-06T09:57:00.000Z	k0rbis		Arch Linux is okay..
2010-03-06T09:57:00.000Z	k0rbis		I still prefer BT4, Slackware, CentOS, Linux Mint, Super OS, and Ubuntu
2010-03-06T09:58:00.000Z	k0rbis		I just find it easier to install what I need using Ubuntu.
2010-03-06T09:59:00.000Z	k0rbis		If they make it where you can customize the software at the beginning of Ubuntu installation, then it would be awesome.
