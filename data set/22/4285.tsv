2008-10-13T07:31:00.000Z	Joeseph		what is the syntax for removing (purging or removing) a package?
2008-10-13T07:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Joeseph	sudo apt-get --purge remove <package name>
2008-10-13T07:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Joeseph	whats the package name?
2008-10-13T07:35:00.000Z	Joeseph	ActionParsnip	It was called jokosher.
2008-10-13T07:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Joeseph	cool
2008-10-13T07:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Joeseph	you can remove orphaned packages wth sudo apt-get autoremove
2008-10-13T07:36:00.000Z	Joeseph	ActionParsnip	Will do, it suggested  that I do that.
2008-10-13T07:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Joeseph	look at what its going to remove before continuing
2008-10-13T07:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Joeseph	audacity maybe
2008-10-13T07:43:00.000Z	Joeseph	ActionParsnip	Isn't that mostly just a wave editor? I may be wrong.
2009-06-06T23:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Joeseph	not every system needs it so its optional
2009-06-06T23:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Joeseph	it will be on the cd if you enable your cd as a repo
2009-06-06T23:59:00.000Z	Joeseph	ActionParsnip	 I've but in the cd, and loaded the cdrom, and it tells me "please insert the cdrom onto /cdrom/
2009-06-06T23:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Joeseph	then inset the cd you installed with and it will be installed from that'
2009-06-06T23:59:00.000Z	Joeseph	ActionParsnip	I installed it with a live usb; How does that work?
2009-06-07T00:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Joeseph	you'll have to mount the usb to where the cd usually mounts, or edit the sources.list file so that it points where the usb mounts
2009-06-07T00:03:00.000Z	Joeseph	ActionParsnip	"sudo mount /media/disk /media/cdrom" tells me that /media/disk is not a block device.....
2009-06-07T00:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Joeseph	/media/cdrom is already an folder so a symlink won't work. If you run: sudo umount /media/disk then mount the usb to /media/cdrom
2010-01-03T23:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Joeseph	none
2010-01-03T23:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Joeseph	its not needed
2010-01-03T23:27:00.000Z	Joeseph	ActionParsnip	Oh.  Then I've done something wrong... hmmm Alright, I'll dig around a big.
2010-01-03T23:28:00.000Z	Joeseph	ActionParsnip	so if I have the line "255.0.0.0  google.com" in my /etc/hosts file, I shouldn't be able to access google, right?
