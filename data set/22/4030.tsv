2008-11-08T01:14:00.000Z	Marsjanin	YeTr2	I logon via gdm, default in Ubuntu, and I think I can't good understand you.
2008-11-08T01:15:00.000Z	YeTr2	Marsjanin	go to system -> administration -> login window
2008-11-08T01:15:00.000Z	YeTr2	Marsjanin	that opens up gdmsetup
2008-11-08T01:16:00.000Z	YeTr2	Marsjanin	under security, uncheck 'deny tcp connections to the xserver'
2008-11-08T01:16:00.000Z	YeTr2	Marsjanin	then restart your desktop.
