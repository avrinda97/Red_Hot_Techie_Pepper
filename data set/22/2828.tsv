2009-02-22T16:04:00.000Z	aniiena		ahh well, FF works ok
2009-02-22T16:04:00.000Z	aniiena		he will just have to deal with it being a little slow when he draws
2009-02-22T16:06:00.000Z	aniiena		load average: 1.13, 1.32, 1.00
2009-02-22T16:07:00.000Z	aniiena		ok after killing 8301
2009-02-22T16:08:00.000Z	aniiena		it's 0.44, 1.07, 0.93
2009-02-22T16:08:00.000Z	aniiena		first number is at time of poll, then over the last 5 minutes and the last 10?
2009-02-22T16:10:00.000Z	aniiena		no idea
2009-02-22T16:11:00.000Z	aniiena		could it be that I changed from Xubuntu's desktop to LXDE?
2009-02-22T16:11:00.000Z	aniiena		without rebooting or restarting x windows?
2009-02-22T16:11:00.000Z	illumin8	aniiena	perhaps creating a new user account created two seperate files for xorg
2009-02-22T16:15:00.000Z	illumin8	aniiena	had xubuntu, if for some reason it created a seperate location for xorg its possible when it was altered to the new desktop gui that another was created. thats all.
2009-02-22T16:28:00.000Z	illumin8	aniiena	you sent ascii art to the pastebin.
2009-02-22T16:34:00.000Z	illumin8	aniiena	the errors are all connected and revolve around your ATI drivers.
2009-02-22T16:35:00.000Z	illumin8	aniiena	yes without question.
2009-02-22T16:39:00.000Z	aniiena	illumin8	in Hardware Drivers it says that my proprietary drivers are activated and currently in use.
2009-02-22T16:41:00.000Z	illumin8	aniiena	are you using the recommended pack?
2009-02-22T16:42:00.000Z	illumin8	aniiena	does it give multiple options with (recomended) following one of them
2009-02-22T16:43:00.000Z	illumin8	aniiena	hmm.
2009-02-22T16:44:00.000Z	illumin8	aniiena	check this link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2009-02-22T16:46:00.000Z	illumin8	aniiena	type lspci | grep VGA
2009-02-22T16:48:00.000Z	illumin8	aniiena	hold on, hwm is saying its not going to make a change to your fglrx file which is causing the heavy load.
2009-02-22T16:51:00.000Z	illumin8	aniiena	i really am unsure on how to proceed here. updateing your ati drivers may resolve the problem, then again it may do nothing but give you more control options. im sorry but i should bow out on this.
