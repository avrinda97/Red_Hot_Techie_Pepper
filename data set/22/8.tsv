2004-11-01T11:12:00.000Z	KeyserSoze		hello
2004-11-01T11:12:00.000Z	mdz	KeyserSoze	which jre are you using?
2004-11-01T11:13:00.000Z	KeyserSoze	mdz	the oracle one
2004-11-01T11:13:00.000Z	mdz	KeyserSoze	there are several 1.4.2 JVMs, and i don't have a copy of oracle
2004-11-01T11:13:00.000Z	mdz	KeyserSoze	java -version
2004-11-01T11:16:00.000Z	mdz	KeyserSoze	do you get the error if you run simple java programs, or only from oracle?
2004-11-01T11:17:00.000Z	mdz	KeyserSoze	try hello world, and work up from there
2004-11-01T11:17:00.000Z	mdz	KeyserSoze	I didn't think Oracle had a Linux/amd64 product; is this the Linux/i386 version?
2004-11-01T11:21:00.000Z	mdz	KeyserSoze	fabbione: you set LC_ALL=C and it still happens?
2004-11-01T11:22:00.000Z	KeyserSoze	mdz	tried all env vars already
2004-11-01T11:22:00.000Z	KeyserSoze	mdz	its apparently a glib problem
2004-11-01T11:22:00.000Z	mdz	KeyserSoze	you mean glibc?
2004-11-01T11:26:00.000Z	mdz	KeyserSoze	if it were a glibc problem, it would likely affect all other gettext-using programs as well
2004-11-01T11:27:00.000Z	mdz	KeyserSoze	I assume you don't get any warnings when you run "perl -e ''" ?
2004-11-01T11:31:00.000Z	mdz	KeyserSoze	did you try that perl command?
2004-11-01T11:33:00.000Z	KeyserSoze	mdz	yeah no problem
2004-11-01T11:34:00.000Z	mdz	KeyserSoze	where did LANG=en_US.UTF-8 come from?
2004-11-01T11:34:00.000Z	mdz	KeyserSoze	you got no output from perl -e '', but dpkg-reconfigure locales output perl errors?
2004-11-01T11:35:00.000Z	KeyserSoze	mdz	exactly
2004-11-01T11:40:00.000Z	KeyserSoze	mdz	that LANG=en_US.UTF-8 comes from /etc/environment
2004-11-01T12:01:00.000Z	mdz	KeyserSoze	what was the outcome of that test?
2004-11-01T12:01:00.000Z	KeyserSoze	mdz	getting Xlib errors
