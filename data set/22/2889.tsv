2009-02-03T10:22:00.000Z	a|3x		i am very confused about sound systems in linux
2009-02-03T10:22:00.000Z	a|3x		could someone please clarify some things for me
2009-02-03T10:22:00.000Z	a|3x		there are different sound systems, right?
2009-02-03T10:23:00.000Z	lstarnes	a|3x	yes
2009-02-03T10:23:00.000Z	lstarnes	a|3x	I think multiple ones can be used
2009-02-03T10:24:00.000Z	lstarnes	a|3x	I don't think /dev/dsp is the only sound device
2009-02-03T10:24:00.000Z	a|3x	lstarnes	cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp --- bash: /dev/dsp: Device or resource busy
2009-02-03T10:25:00.000Z	a|3x	lstarnes	how can i write to /dev/dsp then when it is being used?
2009-02-03T10:26:00.000Z	lstarnes	a|3x	you will likely need to use a sound device other than /dev/dsp
2009-02-03T10:26:00.000Z	a|3x	lstarnes	vmware has only that option
2009-02-03T10:27:00.000Z	a|3x	lstarnes	vmware has the only option for sound /dev/dsp
2009-02-03T10:27:00.000Z	a|3x	lstarnes	and its busy all the time
2009-02-03T10:27:00.000Z	a|3x	lstarnes	so i can't hear anything in vms
2009-02-03T10:28:00.000Z	lstarnes	a|3x	then close everything that is using sound or try using a different vm
2009-02-03T10:28:00.000Z	a|3x	lstarnes	what, i can't do that, i want to hear sound from all programs like in windows
2009-02-03T10:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	a|3x	I'm able to do that using pulseaudio
2009-02-03T10:31:00.000Z	a|3x	lstarnes	so, would i need to uninstall arts, oss, and alsa and install pulse to make it work?
2009-02-03T10:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	a|3x	no
2009-02-03T10:31:00.000Z	a|3x	lstarnes	by the way, what are these different things, are they all seperate sound systems?
2009-02-03T10:32:00.000Z	lstarnes	a|3x	I think pulse and many other sound daemons use kernel-level interfaces such as oss and alsa, but they are mostly separate
2009-02-03T10:32:00.000Z	a|3x	lstarnes	so, which system is doing the mixing?
2009-02-03T10:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	a|3x	I'm not sure
