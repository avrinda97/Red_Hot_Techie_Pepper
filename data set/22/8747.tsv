2005-08-01T15:04:00.000Z	linukso		Hi! Why do I often experience that files that I can play with mplayer, cant be played with totem, even though ffmpeg is installed? (totem-gstreamer and gstreamer-ffmpeg is installed...)
2005-08-01T15:04:00.000Z	Seveas	linukso	are these wmv files perhaps?
2005-08-01T15:04:00.000Z	linukso	Seveas	nope, mpeg4
2005-08-01T15:05:00.000Z	Seveas	linukso	totem-xine can use it
2005-08-01T15:07:00.000Z	Seveas	linukso	gstreamer cannot handle mpeg4 I guess
2005-08-01T15:08:00.000Z	linukso	Seveas	but the gstreamer-ffmpeg package claims that it does :)... But, no need to bother you anymore, I
2005-08-01T15:08:00.000Z	linukso	Seveas	thanks
2005-08-04T16:28:00.000Z	Seveas	linukso	why would there be?
2005-08-04T16:28:00.000Z	linukso	Seveas	cause I need the header files :)
2005-08-04T16:28:00.000Z	linukso	Seveas	checking for XScreenSaverQueryInfo in -lXext... no :(
2005-08-04T16:29:00.000Z	linukso	Seveas	any ideas?
2005-08-04T16:29:00.000Z	Seveas	linukso	find libxext-dev then :)
2005-08-04T16:29:00.000Z	Seveas	linukso	do you happen to know the name of the headerfile?
2005-08-04T16:29:00.000Z	linukso	Seveas	hmm, that might be something. thanks scrnsaver.h
2005-08-04T16:30:00.000Z	Seveas	linukso	libxss-dev
2005-08-04T16:31:00.000Z	linukso	Seveas	awesome! Thanks! Been searching for xscreensaver, but that didn't return that package :)
2005-08-04T16:31:00.000Z	Seveas	linukso	thank apt-file, it found it for me :)
2005-08-04T16:33:00.000Z	linukso	Seveas	hmmm... :-S, never used that... Learn something every day. Maybe the file search option should be in synaptic (then I would have found it :) )
2005-08-04T16:34:00.000Z	Seveas	linukso	it shouldn't
2005-08-04T16:35:00.000Z	linukso	Seveas	but it could have been a plugin :
2005-08-07T16:06:00.000Z	Seveas	linukso	ghe, that makes it even easier :)
2005-08-07T13:44:00.000Z	linukso	Seveas	is it possible to remove lvm, raid and evm from boot?
