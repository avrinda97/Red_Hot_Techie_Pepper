2006-05-26T13:03:00.000Z	jayrod06		hi guys
2006-05-26T13:04:00.000Z	jayrod06		quick question about kernels
2006-05-26T13:04:00.000Z	jayrod06		i have an athlon non xp and i was wondering whether or not to use i686 or k7 kernel
2006-05-26T13:05:00.000Z	jayrod06		anyone?
2006-05-26T13:06:00.000Z	jayrod06		k7 has no advantage over i686?
2006-05-26T13:07:00.000Z	jayrod06		the synaptec description reads k7 for athlon, i686 for pentium 4
2006-05-26T13:07:00.000Z	jayrod06		is k7 also optimized for anything i686 is optimized for?
2006-05-26T13:07:00.000Z	DBO	jayrod06	what proc do you have
2006-05-26T13:08:00.000Z	DBO	jayrod06	yeah, get 686
2006-05-26T13:08:00.000Z	DBO	jayrod06	k7 is for XP and 64 bit
2006-05-26T13:12:00.000Z	DBO	jayrod06	the ati driver is the only one that supports 3D for you
2006-05-26T13:17:00.000Z	DBO	jayrod06	you are running a Thunderbird correct?
2006-05-26T13:17:00.000Z	jayrod06	DBO	yep
2006-05-26T13:18:00.000Z	DBO	jayrod06	I believe thunderbirds are k6-3's, but I could be all wrong here, and that XP's are k7, and 64's are k8...  which means you would want the 686 kernel
2006-05-26T13:20:00.000Z	DBO	jayrod06	just did some googling, thunderbird was the k7... go ahead and get the k7 core
2006-05-26T13:21:00.000Z	DBO	jayrod06	yeah, thats right... my mistake.  I was off by a number, get the k7 kernel =)
2006-05-26T13:21:00.000Z	DBO	jayrod06	no, k7 contains all the 686 optimizations
2006-05-26T13:28:00.000Z	DBO	jayrod06	my experience is anything less that 1GB will feel rather clunky (well actually I think OS X feels clunky all the time)
2006-05-26T13:31:00.000Z	DBO	jayrod06	you should get a real computer =)  but Im just bias...
2006-05-26T13:33:00.000Z	DBO	jayrod06	check hardware compatibility before you buy =)
2006-05-26T12:27:00.000Z	DBO	jayrod06	mostly because quicktime is proprietary and support is spotchy and hard...  that and I dont use it =P
2006-05-26T12:47:00.000Z	DBO	jayrod06	rm -r /dir
