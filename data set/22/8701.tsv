2005-06-11T07:46:00.000Z	kalenedrael		athlon64s throttle?
2005-06-11T07:47:00.000Z	kalenedrael		yes, my laptop does that
2005-06-11T07:47:00.000Z	kalenedrael		although i haven't done anything with throttling
2005-06-11T07:47:00.000Z	kalenedrael		throttling = pointless on a desktop, imho
2005-06-11T07:48:00.000Z	kalenedrael		yeah, mine runs at 800MHz idle
2005-06-11T07:48:00.000Z	kalenedrael		or when running nice processes
2005-06-11T07:48:00.000Z	kalenedrael		well, throttle limits the max cpu load, right?
2005-06-11T07:49:00.000Z	kalenedrael		oh, never mind then
2005-06-11T07:49:00.000Z	kalenedrael		i thought that was cpu frequency scaling
2005-06-11T07:50:00.000Z	kalenedrael		apple is switching to intel cpus?!
2005-06-11T07:50:00.000Z	synd	kalenedrael	no
2005-06-11T07:50:00.000Z	kalenedrael		ok, that's what i thought
2005-06-11T07:51:00.000Z	synd	kalenedrael	apple has been talking to intel, but the move is unlikely
2005-06-11T07:52:00.000Z	kalenedrael	synd	considering intel's reputation for making not-so-great architectures, i believe that
2005-06-11T07:52:00.000Z	kalenedrael		the pentium m is ok
2005-06-11T07:52:00.000Z	synd		theres nothing on thinksecret.com
2005-06-11T07:53:00.000Z	kalenedrael		hmm, now that's different
2005-06-11T07:53:00.000Z	synd		it was talking about apple and intel about a week ago
2005-06-11T07:53:00.000Z	kalenedrael		aren't they based on the pentium 3?
2005-06-11T07:53:00.000Z	synd		http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0505itunes49.html
2005-06-11T07:53:00.000Z	kalenedrael		i still think the G5 processors have the best architecture
2005-06-11T07:54:00.000Z	synd	kalenedrael	most definitely
