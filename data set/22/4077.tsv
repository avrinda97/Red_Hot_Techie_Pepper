2008-03-26T04:50:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes		Hi, does anyone know where chkconfig is on Ubuntu Server 7.10?
2008-03-26T04:51:00.000Z	kindofabuzz_	LinuxMercedes	i think you have to install chkconfig, not in by default
2008-03-26T04:51:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	kindofabuzz_	that would explain why it's not in /sbin =]  Thanks!
2008-03-26T04:51:00.000Z	kindofabuzz_	LinuxMercedes	try apt-get install chkconfig
2008-03-26T04:52:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	kindofabuzz_	doing that right now
2008-03-26T04:52:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	kindofabuzz_	"E: Package chkconfig has no installation candidate" =[
2008-03-26T04:53:00.000Z	kindofabuzz_	LinuxMercedes	hmm dunno them =)
2008-03-26T04:53:00.000Z	kindofabuzz_		then
2008-03-26T04:54:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	kindofabuzz_	ok, maybe you can tell me what I'm really trying to do
2008-03-26T04:54:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	kindofabuzz_	I'm installing a dns update client, and it tells me to run this command: "/sbin/chkconfig --add ddclient"
2008-03-26T04:54:00.000Z	kindofabuzz_	LinuxMercedes	probably not lol
2008-03-26T04:54:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	kindofabuzz_	lol

2008-03-26T04:56:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	kindofabuzz_	ok, thanks.
2008-03-26T04:57:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	kindofabuzz_	tonyyarusso: either of you know the analogous command for sysv-rc-conf?
2008-03-26T04:58:00.000Z	kindofabuzz_	LinuxMercedes	no i don't know, and it probably won't take long to build that chkconfig
2008-03-26T04:58:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	kindofabuzz_	ok, Ill go ahead and build it
2008-03-26T05:15:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	kindofabuzz_	alright, any ideas as to why I get a permission denied when running ./configure?
2008-03-26T05:16:00.000Z	kindofabuzz_		sudo
2008-03-26T05:16:00.000Z	kindofabuzz_		?
2008-03-26T05:16:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	kindofabuzz_	tried, command not found
2008-03-26T05:16:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	kindofabuzz_	what's weird is that it's in my home dir
