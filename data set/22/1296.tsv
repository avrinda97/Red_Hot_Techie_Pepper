2011-04-26T02:10:00.000Z	nishttal2		how do i force apt-get to rebuild its installed packages list?
2011-04-26T02:10:00.000Z	nishttal2		on my system
2011-04-26T02:12:00.000Z	nishttal2		anyone?
2011-04-26T02:13:00.000Z	nishttal2		my apt-get installed package list seems to be out of sync
2011-04-26T02:13:00.000Z	Ampelbein	nishttal2	what do you mean by that? what error do you get?
2011-04-26T02:15:00.000Z	nishttal2	Ampelbein	look at http://fpaste.org/uDbS/
2011-04-26T02:15:00.000Z	nishttal2	Ampelbein	its saying mysqld_safe is part of a package (suggesting i install it)
2011-04-26T02:15:00.000Z	nishttal2	Ampelbein	but when i try to its saying you already have it installed
2011-04-26T02:17:00.000Z	Ampelbein	nishttal2	'sudo apt-get install --reinstall mysql-server-5.1'
2011-04-26T02:18:00.000Z	Ampelbein	nishttal2	the error doesn't come from your apt-get data being out of sync, the message comes from the 'command-not-found' utility
2011-04-26T02:19:00.000Z	nishttal2	Ampelbein	no luck http://fpaste.org/R2Ig/
2011-04-26T02:19:00.000Z	nishttal2	Ampelbein	i see
2011-04-26T02:20:00.000Z	Ampelbein	nishttal2	hmm, your /etc/mysql directory doesn't seem to exist, did you delete it?
2011-04-26T02:20:00.000Z	nishttal2	Ampelbein	yes i did
2011-04-26T02:21:00.000Z	nishttal2	Ampelbein	thinking a new install would/should recreate it
2011-04-26T02:21:00.000Z	nishttal2	Ampelbein	but after this install i see that the directory is there.. with a debian.cnf file in it..
2011-04-26T02:22:00.000Z	Ampelbein	nishttal2	you need to install the correct packages for that. never delete a system directory.... and never work as root. because these things happen if you do that...
2011-04-26T02:22:00.000Z	nishttal2	Ampelbein	i started working as root in frustration.. tried for an hour as regular user
2011-04-26T02:23:00.000Z	nishttal2	Ampelbein	now the /etc/mysql folder is there should i try installing again?
2011-04-26T02:23:00.000Z	Ampelbein	nishttal2	no, it wouldn't help. you need probably to reinstall the -common data packages
2011-04-26T02:28:00.000Z	nishttal2	Ampelbein	this is looking like a complete ubuntu re-install :(
2011-04-26T02:28:00.000Z	nishttal2	Ampelbein	thanks for your help
