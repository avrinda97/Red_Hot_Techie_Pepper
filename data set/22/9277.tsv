2005-01-09T15:25:00.000Z	DarkSilver		I have a question (sorry for repost): who do I have to contact about the package version in hoary ?
2005-01-09T15:26:00.000Z	ogra	DarkSilver	which package ?
2005-01-09T15:27:00.000Z	DarkSilver	ogra	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=9496
2005-01-09T15:28:00.000Z	ogra	DarkSilver	they get in automatically if sid is synced again.....
2005-01-09T15:28:00.000Z	ogra	DarkSilver	hoary regulary syncs with sid
2005-01-09T15:28:00.000Z	DarkSilver	ogra	but some package are in Hoary before sid...
2005-01-09T15:29:00.000Z	ogra	DarkSilver	yep....because they are made by ubuntu devs.... they then get synced back
2005-01-09T15:30:00.000Z	DarkSilver	ogra	that would be better than hoary provides also its own packages (php5) instead of waiting them in SID
2005-01-09T15:33:00.000Z	DarkSilver	ogra	But where can I ask for suggestions of package ? (MySQL 4.1.8 by default, or the choice between OOo 1.1.4 & 1.9.65 (it's 'only' 1.1.3 in hoary))
2005-01-09T15:33:00.000Z	ogra	DarkSilver	either ubuntu-users or ubuntu-devel
2005-01-09T15:34:00.000Z	ogra	DarkSilver	there will be 2.0 if hoary goes public i think
2005-01-09T15:35:00.000Z	ogra	DarkSilver	there is, look for hoary goals
2005-01-09T15:36:00.000Z	DarkSilver	ogra	: that's not really the same
2005-01-09T15:36:00.000Z	ogra	DarkSilver	hoary will have all package versions that are in sid if hoary freezes....
2005-01-09T15:37:00.000Z	ogra	DarkSilver	warty ?
2005-01-09T15:37:00.000Z	DarkSilver	ogra	: yes, but for the packages that are not in sid or not up-to-date in sid ?
2005-01-09T15:37:00.000Z	ogra	DarkSilver	warty doesnt recieve updates despite security stuff
2005-01-09T15:37:00.000Z	DarkSilver	ogra	not warty, i'm talking about the devel-hoary I use everyday (I don't want to wait until march 2005 ;) )
2005-01-09T15:38:00.000Z	ogra	DarkSilver	as i said it gets synced regulary.... dont ask me for the timeframe
2005-01-09T15:39:00.000Z	DarkSilver	ogra	: but it's wired... some new packages are up-to-date, and some older than 10 days in SID are not in horay... Seems like a "selected-sync"
2005-01-09T15:40:00.000Z	ogra	DarkSilver	maybe, probably it are pkgs where someone just works on
2005-01-09T15:40:00.000Z	ogra	DarkSilver	wouldnt be nice to overwrite his work with a sid version....
