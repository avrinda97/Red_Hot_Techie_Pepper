2010-06-02T05:23:00.000Z	mc__	gbillings	yes you are missing that library
2010-06-02T05:24:00.000Z	gbillings	mc__	how can i install it?
2010-06-02T05:24:00.000Z	mc__	gbillings	try installing the package libreadline6 let me know if that fixed it
2010-06-02T05:26:00.000Z	mc__	gbillings	could it be that you are on a 64bit system you are trying to run a 32 bit app?
2010-06-02T05:27:00.000Z	mc__	gbillings	is libreadline5 installed too?
2010-06-02T05:29:00.000Z	gbillings	mc__	sudo apt-get install libreadline5 returns http://pastebay.com/101646
2010-06-02T05:35:00.000Z	gbillings	mc__	sudo apt-get install libreadline5 yields http://pastebay.com/101646
2010-06-02T05:35:00.000Z	mc__	gbillings	got it, looks like there is something misssing in ubuntus version of readling
2010-06-02T05:36:00.000Z	mc__	gbillings	some guy here had the same problem, he said manually building readline fixes it
2010-06-02T05:36:00.000Z	gbillings	mc__	thats the strange thing... thats how i installed it in the first place
2010-06-02T05:37:00.000Z	mc__	gbillings	did you reboot since then?
2010-06-02T05:37:00.000Z	gbillings	mc__	i will do that now.... i will be back in 4 minutes
2010-06-02T05:40:00.000Z	gbillings	mc__	i still have the same issue after restarting
2010-06-02T05:41:00.000Z	mc__	gbillings	okay, at this point I'm just guessing really, but for some people sudo apt-get install ubuntu-keyring  seemed to have fixed a similar problem
2010-06-02T05:42:00.000Z	gbillings	mc__	same strange error...
2010-06-02T05:43:00.000Z	mc__	gbillings	I'm sorry you could try asking for help via launchpad answerss
2010-06-02T05:44:00.000Z	gbillings	mc__	do you know how to fix [Install these packages without verification [y/N]?] it apears on all packages ever from regular repositories?
2010-06-02T05:46:00.000Z	gbillings	mc__	it says gpgv cannot be executed... may be related to the other error?
2010-06-02T05:47:00.000Z	mc__	gbillings	I'm sorry i do not know and I have to go now, I really hope that somebody else can help you
