2011-11-14T10:18:00.000Z	crassus		Hi, I'm wondering when I'm using something like tty1, if it's possible to use xmonad or other window managers with it
2011-11-14T10:18:00.000Z	crassus		like dwm, etc
2011-11-14T10:19:00.000Z	crassus		I'd like to tile apps in the tty, you see
2011-11-14T10:19:00.000Z	qin	crassus	All x dm will use vt, but you can xinit -- :1 vt1 (so xterm will land on tty1)
2011-11-14T10:20:00.000Z	crassus	qin	not sure I understand you fully
2011-11-14T10:20:00.000Z	qin	crassus	maybe: fbterm, tmux, screen
2011-11-14T10:20:00.000Z	crassus	qin	^^ ?
2011-11-14T10:21:00.000Z	qin	crassus	Yes, it will
2011-11-14T10:21:00.000Z	qin	crassus	You cant
2011-11-14T10:22:00.000Z	qin	crassus	since, most likely you will crash xserver, use another tty and display
2011-11-14T10:23:00.000Z	qin	crassus	Maybe the is way to wrap xinit, to have it in background, not known to me.
2011-11-14T10:24:00.000Z	qin	crassus	Welcome.
2011-11-14T10:25:00.000Z	qin	crassus	I prefer elinks, coz of tabs
2011-11-14T10:28:00.000Z	qin	crassus	mutt (or pine if you are neurotic)
2011-11-14T10:29:00.000Z	qin	crassus	That mutt is a bit more sane (and probably powerful) than pine
2011-11-14T10:29:00.000Z	qin	crassus	If upower runs? Yes
2011-11-14T10:30:00.000Z	qin	crassus	Amen
2011-11-14T10:32:00.000Z	qin	crassus	I am using tmux, so just locking session, not really sure.
2011-11-14T10:33:00.000Z	crassus	qin	you can lock session in tmux? how?
2011-11-14T10:34:00.000Z	qin	crassus	man tmux | less -p lock-session
2011-11-14T10:35:00.000Z	qin	crassus	No, I am just coffee addict.
2011-11-14T10:41:00.000Z	crassus	qin	upower does not seem to be running, however `ps aux | grep upower` shows upowerd daemon is running. how do I make sure upower is running?
