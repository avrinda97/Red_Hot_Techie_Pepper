2008-11-14T21:18:00.000Z	Meshach		Hey*
2008-11-14T21:19:00.000Z	Meshach		Question; I hooked up my wireless network and there about 8 other computers on the network but I can't see them... I installed Samba, and it says you need to restart the session, how do I do that, just reboot?
2008-11-14T21:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Meshach	you shouldn't need to restart anything
2008-11-14T21:18:00.000Z	Meshach	ikonia	Hay man.
2008-11-14T21:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Meshach	hello
2008-11-14T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Meshach	what says you need to restart the session
2008-11-14T21:19:00.000Z	Meshach	ikonia	After I install samba
2008-11-14T21:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Meshach	are you sure other updates, such as a kernel update didn't come down with it
2008-11-14T21:20:00.000Z	Meshach	ikonia	Hmm.. That's wierd because after installing samba it says to restart the session.
2008-11-14T21:21:00.000Z	Meshach	ikonia	I'm sure. Because I was only trying to share a folder and it said something about sharing with windows and it says I need samba blah blah and I installled it.
2008-11-14T21:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Meshach	aamba shouldn't need a restat, but hey, restart it
2008-11-14T21:21:00.000Z	Meshach	ikonia	Is it the same as rebooting, because I did that.
2008-11-14T21:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Meshach	I assume so, but as you shouldn't need a restart, I don't know what it wants
2008-11-14T22:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Meshach	stop
2008-11-14T22:10:00.000Z	Meshach	ikonia	Ok. How do I alert an admin though?
2008-11-14T22:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Meshach	you just did - what's up
