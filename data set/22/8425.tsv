2005-08-29T12:34:00.000Z	bob2	laserline	report a bug on the linux component
2005-08-29T12:34:00.000Z	laserline	bob2	- how do i do that ? this is the first bug i encounter...
2005-08-29T12:35:00.000Z	bob2	laserline	bugzilla.ubuntu.com, linux is the component
2005-08-29T12:36:00.000Z	bob2	laserline	depends on what the problem is
2005-08-29T12:38:00.000Z	bob2	laserline	no need to /msg me
2005-08-29T12:38:00.000Z	bob2	laserline	it's red because I started the line with your name, and your client coloured it
2005-08-29T12:40:00.000Z	bob2	laserline	yes, most clients do that.  it's possible to disable/change the colour/etc, tho, and it all happens on the client end
2005-08-29T12:40:00.000Z	laserline	bob2	is there any more information i shoud put in the bugzilla ?
2005-08-29T12:41:00.000Z	bob2	laserline	laptop details, as much output as you can capture, versions, etc
2005-08-29T12:43:00.000Z	laserline	bob2	when i run sleep from gnome menu it really runs /etc/acpi/sleep.sh - so if i sudo it from terminal, it'd be good input (or am i wrong?)
2005-08-29T12:45:00.000Z	laserline	bob2	does sleep from gnome meny the same thing as sudo /etc/acpi/sleep.sh
2005-08-29T12:45:00.000Z	bob2	laserline	afaik, yes
2005-08-29T12:49:00.000Z	laserline	bob2	i only see linux as OS after choosing Ubuntu as product, should i put Linux in the package dialogue ?
2005-08-29T12:49:00.000Z	bob2	laserline	hm, no, I think me memory sucks
2005-08-29T12:50:00.000Z	laserline	bob2	so.... how to report the bug in the best way ?
