2009-07-04T22:03:00.000Z	dury	quidnunc	in third party software tab
2009-07-04T22:04:00.000Z	quidnunc	dury	Yes. Did you add it?

2009-07-04T22:09:00.000Z	quidnunc	dury	There are some extra steps you can take to only upgrade firefox (/etc/apt/preferences)

2009-07-04T22:11:00.000Z	dury	quidnunc	it will update automatically I guess with time
2009-07-04T22:11:00.000Z	quidnunc	dury	Yes. But if you want it now then that is the way to do it.
2009-07-04T22:12:00.000Z	quidnunc	dury	It is not *very* complicated but if you feel uncomfortable doing those steps then I suggest you wait.
2009-07-04T22:14:00.000Z	dury	quidnunc	3.0.11 it's not bad isn't it?
2009-07-04T22:16:00.000Z	quidnunc	dury	No it isn't. Javascript is noticeably faster on firefox-3.5 though.
