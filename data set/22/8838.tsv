2005-09-19T11:08:00.000Z	rosh		is it possible to use a partition as a home directory for two different distros running on the same machine?
2005-09-19T11:09:00.000Z	rosh		russ[] , the fstab line I used had the following parameters:  defaults 1 1
2005-09-19T11:09:00.000Z	rosh		russ[] , is this correct?
2005-09-19T11:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rosh	yes, but if they use different user id numbers things can get tricky
2005-09-19T11:09:00.000Z	rosh	thoreauputic	ah, that is likely what is happening, can I manually set the user id number?
2005-09-19T11:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rosh	you can, yes - preferably on the non-debian style distro though ( like changing 501 to 1001 )
2005-09-19T11:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rosh	I'm not sure of the details though
2005-09-19T11:11:00.000Z	rosh	thoreauputic	the uid is the field we are referring to, correct?
2005-09-19T11:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rosh	yes
2005-09-19T11:12:00.000Z	rosh	thoreauputic	what is the problem with changing the uid in ubuntu
2005-09-19T11:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rosh	the other issues is some distros put all users in the "users" group by default
2005-09-19T11:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rosh	not a problem - I guess either way could work if there are no conflicts
2005-09-19T11:13:00.000Z	rosh	thoreauputic	can you give an example of a conflict?
2005-09-19T11:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rosh	not off th etop of my head - but say you have a user foo with uid 503 and that uid is used by another distro for some purpose...
2005-09-19T11:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rosh	just trying to cover possible issues
2005-09-19T11:15:00.000Z	rosh	thoreauputic	thank you, I appreciate your help, but I believe my setup is simple enough:  I only have two distros installed, and I am the only one that uses both
2005-09-19T11:16:00.000Z	rosh	thoreauputic	I just started using ubuntu, trying it out and seeing if i like it, and want to be able to share my home folder from the other distro installed
2005-09-19T11:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rosh	you might need to add your ubuntu user to the users group, IIRC
2005-09-19T11:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rosh	depending on the conventions of your other distro
2005-09-19T11:18:00.000Z	rosh		does ubuntu use the "users" group?
2005-09-19T11:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rosh	also be aware of the user needing to be in the admin group for sudo privileges in ubuntu
2005-09-19T11:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rosh	in ubuntu all files made by a user are user:user  not user:users ( eg peter:peter not peter:users )
