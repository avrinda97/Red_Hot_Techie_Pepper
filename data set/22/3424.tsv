2009-05-07T11:18:00.000Z	valentinex		hi anybody here using ubuntu 9.04 and knows about manual partitions?
2009-05-07T11:19:00.000Z	valentinex		with auto partitions it was taking 6GB, now i want manual partitions how to set ? i shall set 500mb swap, how much root and ext4 ?
2009-05-07T11:20:00.000Z	EdgEy	valentinex	with 6gb you should probably set /home / to the same partition
2009-05-07T11:21:00.000Z	valentinex	EdgEy	ext 4 home to 6GB ? ok and how much root? root can also be setted to ext4?
2009-05-07T11:22:00.000Z	EdgEy	valentinex	if you only make "/"
2009-05-07T11:22:00.000Z	EdgEy		and make no "/home" partition
2009-05-07T11:22:00.000Z	EdgEy		then /home will be on the "/" partition
2009-05-07T11:22:00.000Z	EdgEy		if you have only limited space that is probably better because you won't have "wasted" space that way
2009-05-07T11:23:00.000Z	valentinex	EdgEy	 "/"  ? "/" will auto set home and root?
2009-05-07T11:24:00.000Z	EdgEy	valentinex	it will put home and root onto the same one - do you have 6gb total available? or just want 6gb for / ?
2009-05-07T11:24:00.000Z	valentinex	EdgEy	i want to set 6gb, have total 10gb will give all 10gb to linux
2009-05-07T11:25:00.000Z	EdgEy	valentinex	i see :) sorry, then make /home 4gb and / 6gb :)
2009-05-07T11:25:00.000Z	valentinex	EdgEy	and swap? have one GB ram
2009-05-07T11:26:00.000Z	EdgEy	valentinex	maybe / 5gb and 1gb swap then, 6gb is quite large, unless you really install a lot
2009-05-07T11:26:00.000Z	EdgEy		my "/" is 28gb and only 2.5gb used hehe
2009-05-07T11:27:00.000Z	valentinex	EdgEy	when i was at 8.10 my swap was always not used or only used few mb
2009-05-07T11:28:00.000Z	valentinex	EdgEy	coz i do not run heavy things and my system have 1gb ram
2009-05-07T11:30:00.000Z	valentinex	EdgEy	are u angry? :P
2009-05-07T11:30:00.000Z	EdgEy	valentinex	no
