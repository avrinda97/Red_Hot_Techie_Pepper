2012-02-07T15:02:00.000Z	zul0		anyone know why in my ifconfig is this wlan0:avahi?
2012-02-07T15:03:00.000Z	ikonia	zul0	yes, it's just showing your wlan0 card having a virtual device, which is how some "drivers" handle it
2012-02-07T15:03:00.000Z	ikonia	zul0	is it causing you a problem
2012-02-07T15:04:00.000Z	zul0	ikonia	how i can disable that?
2012-02-07T15:05:00.000Z	ikonia	zul0	eth0 is your wired connection
2012-02-07T15:06:00.000Z	ikonia	zul0	why can you not use eth0 ?
2012-02-07T15:06:00.000Z	ikonia	zul0	(or normally is I should say)
2012-02-07T15:07:00.000Z	ikonia	zul0	not sure how that's relevant
2012-02-07T15:07:00.000Z	ikonia	zul0	ok - so your wireless card is called wlan0
2012-02-07T15:07:00.000Z	ikonia	zul0	that is the device you need to use for wireless not eth0
2012-02-07T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	zul0	then I'm failing to see your problem,
2012-02-07T15:10:00.000Z	zul0	ikonia	i usually use wlan0 (wireless adapter) to connect with my router, but this morning i got some fails and meanwhile im connect to my wired adapter (eth0)
2012-02-07T15:11:00.000Z	ikonia	zul0	ok - don't worry, first thing, reboot, see if network manager comes back and allows you to connect using wlan0 again
2012-02-07T15:11:00.000Z	zul0	ikonia	reboot service or my laptop?
2012-02-07T15:11:00.000Z	ikonia	zul0	reboot your laptop
2012-02-07T15:14:00.000Z	zul0	ikonia	dont work. my network-manager icon is not in gnome-panel
2012-02-07T15:15:00.000Z	ikonia	zul0	what version of ubuntu is this ?
2012-02-07T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	zul0	right click on the pannel and try to re-add gnome-network manager or launch it manually from the command line, see if it shows you why it's crashing
2012-02-07T15:19:00.000Z	zul0	ikonia	it start without problem but in wired connection and wireless network not appear nothing about adapters. they are disabled (but working at least eth0)
2012-02-07T15:21:00.000Z	ikonia	zul0	so in gnome network manager the wireless card is now visiable ?
2012-02-07T15:25:00.000Z	zul0	ikonia	maybe this help u to understand my problem http://postimage.org/image/lmjnikvhf/
2012-02-07T15:52:00.000Z	zul0	ikonia	i have solved my problem editing nm config. Thanks for help me.
