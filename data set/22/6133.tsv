2007-02-01T11:38:00.000Z	ledemente		Because if the second one is free, I will need to format it. Then move /home onto it.
2007-02-01T11:38:00.000Z	hayden	ledemente	$ mount
2007-02-01T11:43:00.000Z	hayden	ledemente	check s/hdbX
2007-02-01T11:45:00.000Z	hayden	ledemente	sdb or hdb (depending on the type of hard  drive you have) is the second hard drive, if you see hdb1 or hdb2 after you run $mount that means that the first or second partition on the second hard drive is mounted
2007-02-01T11:47:00.000Z	hayden	ledemente	you aren't talking to felixhummel, if there is no sdb or hdb the second hard drive is not mounted
2007-02-01T11:47:00.000Z	ledemente	hayden	sorry, the "highlight" colour is bright yellow and I couldn't read it. XD
2007-02-01T11:48:00.000Z	hayden	ledemente	no problem :)
2007-02-01T11:48:00.000Z	ledemente	hayden	so, "mount -t ext2 /dev/hdb /mnt/BACKUP/
2007-02-01T11:49:00.000Z	hayden	ledemente	you also need to specify the partition number, e.g. /dev/hdb1
2007-02-01T11:50:00.000Z	ledemente	hayden	I didn't think it was partitioned...
2007-02-01T11:52:00.000Z	hayden	ledemente	there must be one partition only then, unless it is free space
2007-02-01T11:53:00.000Z	ledemente	hayden	I have another harddrive...
2007-02-01T11:53:00.000Z	hayden	ledemente	hdb1 ;)
2007-02-01T11:54:00.000Z	ledemente	hayden	I tried that, but it's not ext2, and I have no idea what it is.
2007-02-01T11:54:00.000Z	ledemente	hayden	anything other than "hdb" "does not exist".
2007-02-01T11:55:00.000Z	hayden	ledemente	try $ fdisk -l
2007-02-01T11:56:00.000Z	ledemente	hayden	nothing...
2007-02-01T11:56:00.000Z	ledemente	hayden	Ooops.
2007-02-01T11:56:00.000Z	ledemente	hayden	"can not open /dev/hdb"
2007-02-01T11:58:00.000Z	ledemente	hayden	I'm confused as to what it's indicating though.
2007-02-01T11:59:00.000Z	hayden	ledemente	the type of partitions on all hard drives
2007-02-01T11:59:00.000Z	hayden	ledemente	whether they are mounted or not
