2010-09-19T09:44:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	And copy the files from /etc/skel :)
2010-09-19T09:45:00.000Z	hmw	Arafangi1n	theoretical question: one should be able to log in with an empty home folder, too, but with certain "drawbacks", right?
2010-09-19T09:45:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	Oh, yes, of course.
2010-09-19T09:45:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	You can log in without any home folder, as well. ;)
2010-09-19T09:46:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	(Only on the command line, though - not sure how GDM would handle that...)
2010-09-19T09:46:00.000Z	hmw	Arafangi1n	i was thinking gnome, i guess it should work... somehow...
2010-09-19T09:46:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	I don't think gnome or any of the DE's will have an issue with an empty ~/, as long as you have one.
2010-09-19T09:47:00.000Z	hmw	Arafangi1n	darn. i need to test it now.
2010-09-19T09:49:00.000Z	hmw	Arafangi1n	oh wow / i got autologged in and gnome looks fresh
2010-09-19T09:50:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	Yeah, I doubt it would've had any issues. :)
2010-09-19T10:03:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	Keep in mind that as far as most users are concerned, their own data /is/ the most important part of the system.
2010-09-19T10:16:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	I always feel uncomfortable without a swap file. :)
2010-09-19T10:17:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	Keep in mind that linux overcommits memory.
2010-09-19T10:17:00.000Z	hmw	Arafangi1n	although my swap is only touched, when i use programs with memory leaks, i feel uncomfy without swap, too
2010-09-19T10:18:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	Have you ever had the OOM killer? :)
2010-09-19T10:19:00.000Z	hmw	Arafangi1n	some daemon that kills any process if it allocates more than a MB ??
2010-09-19T10:19:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	The default behavour of a linux system is to give each program as much memory as they ask for, even if it doesn't actually have that memory.
2010-09-19T10:20:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	In practice, this works out well because applications don't neccessarily actually use that memory at that time, but if linux does find itself in the situation where it simply doesn't have enough memory, then it is forced to employ the Out Of Memory Killer.
2010-09-19T10:40:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	With a confused mouse?
2010-09-19T10:40:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	Sounds tricky!
2010-09-19T10:50:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	Or use killall, if you know the command name.
2010-09-19T10:50:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	hmw	That's the redneck approach, anyway.
