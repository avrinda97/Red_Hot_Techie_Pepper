2008-11-29T03:05:00.000Z	Guest74932	draco1234	when i installed libdvd it let me play a dvd i burned from a .iso
2008-11-29T03:05:00.000Z	Guest74932	draco1234	it just wont let me play normal dvd films
2008-11-29T03:06:00.000Z	draco1234	Guest74932	ok, now how about "sudo apt-get install vlc" ?
2008-11-29T03:06:00.000Z	draco1234	Guest74932	vlc player always works the best
2008-11-29T03:06:00.000Z	Guest74932	draco1234	i have vlc
2008-11-29T03:06:00.000Z	Guest74932	draco1234	ive been using it for years
2008-11-29T03:07:00.000Z	draco1234	Guest74932	ok, did you try using vlc for opening the dvd?
2008-11-29T03:07:00.000Z	Guest74932	draco1234	yea, i have it set as the default program
2008-11-29T03:07:00.000Z	draco1234	Guest74932	so if a disc is in, and you go to vlc and open the disc, what does it say?
2008-11-29T03:08:00.000Z	Guest74932	draco1234	it doesnt say anything, vlc opens and it just stays gray, no video
2008-11-29T03:08:00.000Z	draco1234	Guest74932	but vlc works on other files?
2008-11-29T03:08:00.000Z	Guest74932	draco1234	when i try "movie player" or "th"thoggen" or "brasero" it says "no media on disk
2008-11-29T03:09:00.000Z	Guest74932	draco1234	vlc sees it
2008-11-29T03:09:00.000Z	Guest74932	draco1234	just when it tries to play it wont play
2008-11-29T03:09:00.000Z	Guest74932	draco1234	vlc works great for everything else
2008-11-29T03:13:00.000Z	draco1234	Guest74932	any chance it's a defective dvd?
