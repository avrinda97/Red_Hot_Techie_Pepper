2007-09-29T06:40:00.000Z	ntoxin		Does anybody know of an iso burning app in ubuntu?
2007-09-29T06:41:00.000Z	ntoxin		kewl thanks
2007-09-29T06:43:00.000Z	cwillu	ntoxin	just right click on the iso in ubuntu, it'll say "burn to cd"
2007-09-29T06:47:00.000Z	ntoxin	cwillu	right clicking it did'nt work but i dont know if it is because i'm using xubuntu or something!
2007-09-29T06:48:00.000Z	cwillu	ntoxin	ya, xubuntu runs xfce instead of gnome
2007-09-29T06:48:00.000Z	cwillu	ntoxin	and the right clicky thing is nautilus, which is gnome :p
2007-09-29T06:49:00.000Z	cwillu	ntoxin	how close to the minimum specs are you?
2007-09-29T06:50:00.000Z	ntoxin	cwillu	3ghz 1024mb 128mb vid...
2007-09-29T06:50:00.000Z	cwillu	ntoxin	my god man, why are you running xubuntu? :p
2007-09-29T06:52:00.000Z	ntoxin	cwillu	dunno someone told me it might take car of a sound driver i had but it did'nt!
2007-09-29T06:52:00.000Z	cwillu	ntoxin	installing ubuntu-desktop is the simplest answer for me to give, but that'll take a while, download a bunch of stuff, and change a bunch of things;  that said, unless you have a preference for xfce, just straight ubuntu is gonna be better supported
2007-09-29T06:52:00.000Z	cwillu	ntoxin	nah, that wouldn't likely affect anything sound related
2007-09-29T06:54:00.000Z	ntoxin	cwillu	sound seems to be a big topic with linux in general cause i got xubuntu on one computer and puppy linux on the other and both have issues with sound...
2007-09-29T06:54:00.000Z	cwillu	ntoxin	fiesty?
2007-09-29T06:55:00.000Z	cwillu	ntoxin	I haven't run into too many issues;  one laptop (out of a dozen or so)
2007-09-29T06:55:00.000Z	ntoxin	cwillu	well i updated it last night!
2007-09-29T06:56:00.000Z	cwillu	ntoxin	well, lets get you switched back to ubuntu from xubuntu
2007-09-29T06:56:00.000Z	cwillu	ntoxin	and then we can get your alsa issues taken care of
2007-09-29T06:56:00.000Z	cwillu	ntoxin	I've got a couple hours to kill anyway :p
2007-09-29T06:57:00.000Z	ntoxin	cwillu	i'll let my CD finish burning before ripping the operating system out of my computer though!
2007-09-29T06:57:00.000Z	cwillu	ntoxin	awww, where's your sense of adventure?
2007-09-29T06:57:00.000Z	ntoxin	cwillu	ROFL
