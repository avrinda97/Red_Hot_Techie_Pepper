2007-12-27T21:28:00.000Z	nikitis		Question.  Got a new monitor 1920x1200 resolution and i am having trouble with two things.  I have the resolution set correctly, but it's kind of fuzzy.  slightly.  When in windows it's clear and sharp so I know it's capable of looking sharp, but currently it looks like it would if it was using a smaller resolution than normal.  Any ideas?

2007-12-27T21:29:00.000Z	bazhang	nikitis	do you have the restricted drivers installed?
2008-02-26T20:19:00.000Z	bazhang	nikitis	hours and hours of compiling for that nanosecond faster firefox ;]
2008-02-26T20:20:00.000Z	nikitis	bazhang	yes but, we could make it a package
2008-02-26T20:20:00.000Z	nikitis	bazhang	one maintainer, millions of users
2008-02-26T20:22:00.000Z	bazhang	nikitis	millions of 64 bit users? ;]
2008-02-26T20:23:00.000Z	nikitis	bazhang	there would be if it was supported.  Most people with a computer that's 2 years old or newer has 64-bit
2008-02-26T20:23:00.000Z	bazhang	nikitis	I have 64 bit computer and 32bit system just flies ;]
2008-02-26T20:24:00.000Z	nikitis	bazhang	just think how much faster it would fly if you were using 64-bit ;)
2008-11-05T21:46:00.000Z	nikitis	bazhang	that's what i told them to do basically
2008-11-05T21:46:00.000Z	nikitis	bazhang	i got mine working,
2008-11-05T21:47:00.000Z	bazhang	nikitis	nice
2011-05-14T02:07:00.000Z	bazhang	nikitis	just do it with the login window, no need for cli
2011-05-14T02:07:00.000Z	nikitis	bazhang	doesn't show up
2011-05-14T02:07:00.000Z	bazhang	nikitis	sure it does
2011-05-14T02:07:00.000Z	nikitis	bazhang	it's weird.  no at the bottom it's not an option i've seen screenshots of where it should be
2011-05-14T02:08:00.000Z	nikitis	bazhang	when I select "Ubuntu" unity doesn't come up it's classic
2011-05-14T02:09:00.000Z	bazhang	nikitis	no unity available means its not supported. try installing unity-2d
2011-05-14T02:09:00.000Z	nikitis	bazhang	it wasn't supported because I did a fresh upgrade and didn't have the drivers
2011-05-14T02:09:00.000Z	nikitis	bazhang	now I do have them installed.  how do I make it use it
2011-05-14T02:09:00.000Z	bazhang	nikitis	I seriously doubt that card can handle it, mine cannot
