2010-04-30T20:03:00.000Z	alexandru		is there a way to burn the image to a USB and use that to install ubuntu? Right now i'm using slackware.
2010-04-30T20:03:00.000Z	jrib	alexandru	yes, see ubottu for detailed instructions but basically just use the usb-creator program
2010-04-30T20:08:00.000Z	jrib	alexandru	while there are windows instructions, there are also linux instructions.  Specifically, you can use usb-creator
2010-04-30T20:11:00.000Z	jrib	alexandru	usb-creator is in ubuntu repositories.  You can install that on slack if you want.  There's also unetbootin.  See which one is easier to install on slack
2010-04-30T20:28:00.000Z	jrib	alexandru	be more specific than "it doesn't work"
2010-04-30T20:29:00.000Z	alexandru	jrib	I boot from the USB it created and I get a bunch of 99's on the screen
2010-04-30T20:29:00.000Z	jrib	alexandru	what iso are you using? did you check the md5sum of the iso?
2010-04-30T20:30:00.000Z	alexandru	jrib	the iso downloaded from ubuntu.com ... didn't check the md5sum. Where can I find it?
2010-04-30T20:33:00.000Z	alexandru	jrib	the md5sum is correct
2010-04-30T20:33:00.000Z	jrib	alexandru	don't know.  Look into what genii said about 99s usually being associated with lilo.  Ubuntu doesn't use lilo by default
2010-04-30T20:34:00.000Z	alexandru	jrib	I have lilo because I use slackware, but I want to switch to ubuntu
2010-04-30T20:35:00.000Z	jrib	alexandru	lilo shouldn't really come into the picture if you are booting from the usb though and it seems it is
2010-04-30T20:35:00.000Z	alexandru	jrib	the ubuntu image should be on the usb?
2010-04-30T20:36:00.000Z	jrib	alexandru	yeah, unetbootin puts it there
2010-04-30T20:36:00.000Z	alexandru	jrib	it didn't put it on mine
2010-04-30T20:36:00.000Z	jrib	alexandru	maybe that's the issue.  What iso are you using?
2010-04-30T20:37:00.000Z	alexandru	jrib	should I put it there manually?
2010-04-30T20:37:00.000Z	jrib	alexandru	hmm, maybe unetbootin does something different.  I'm pretty sure at least usb-creator just had the iso on the disk
2010-04-30T20:38:00.000Z	alexandru	jrib	do you have a link for usb-creator for linux? I only found windows versions
2010-04-30T20:38:00.000Z	jrib	alexandru	package manager like apt-get
2010-04-30T20:39:00.000Z	jrib	alexandru	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Live_USB_creator I guess, though from experience it seems people usually have more luck with unetbootin
2010-04-30T20:42:00.000Z	alexandru	jrib	damn it ... usb-creator doesn't run on slackware and unetbootin doesn't do the job right
