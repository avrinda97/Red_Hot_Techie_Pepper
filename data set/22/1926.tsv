2009-11-23T03:21:00.000Z	smik		How can I create wireless ad hoc network using the command line?
2009-11-23T03:23:00.000Z	Amaranth	smik	sudo iwconfig eth1 essid "My Network" && sudo iwconfig eth1 mode Ad-Hoc
2009-11-23T03:25:00.000Z	smik	Amaranth	ActionParsnip, binMonkey , Can you do something about this : I use wvdial to connect to internet through GPRS usb modem. Now when I try to connect/create a wirless lan through Network manager, I am unable to use that GPRS internet
2009-11-23T03:26:00.000Z	Amaranth	smik	You mean if you setup a wireless ad-hoc network it disconnects you from the GPRS connection
2009-11-23T03:27:00.000Z	Amaranth	smik	Otherwise what you want to do is setup a wireless ad-hoc connection in networkmanager with the IPv4 settings set to "Share connection" and it'll automatically set it up for you
2009-11-23T03:27:00.000Z	smik	Amaranth	Exactly. I can't say it disconnects me, but the internet just don't work
2009-11-23T03:27:00.000Z	Amaranth	smik	Yeah, try configuring the ad-hoc connection settings to tell network manager you're using it to share another connection
2009-11-23T03:28:00.000Z	smik	Amaranth	I am doing that only, not working
2009-11-23T03:28:00.000Z	smik	Amaranth	When I create a wireless connection and connect to it, my wvdial connection doesn't work.
2009-11-23T03:29:00.000Z	Amaranth	smik	I guess the problem is you're not doing it all through network manager
2009-11-23T03:29:00.000Z	Amaranth	smik	You either have to use network manager for everything or don't use it at all
2009-11-23T03:29:00.000Z	smik	Amaranth	I am doing the wvdial though CLI, and wireless through network connection
2009-11-23T03:30:00.000Z	smik	Amaranth	because the GPRS doesnt' work from NM
2009-11-23T03:30:00.000Z	Amaranth	smik	Hrm, it should work in 9.10 at least
2009-11-23T03:30:00.000Z	smik	Amaranth	Do you suggest me to connect both GPRS as well as ad hoc from CLI. I am using *9.04
2009-11-23T03:31:00.000Z	Amaranth	smik	You'll have to setup both from CLI then, which gets...fun
2009-11-23T03:31:00.000Z	Amaranth	smik	You have to set the wireless mode, channel, and name then give it an IP, configure routes, iptables, etc
2009-11-23T03:32:00.000Z	smik	Amaranth	can you point out to an article for that
2009-11-23T03:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	smik	Nope, I don't even know how to do it all
2009-11-23T03:32:00.000Z	smik	Amaranth	So thats where the catch is!
2009-11-23T03:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	smik	I'd suggest upgrading to 9.10 and seeing if you can do your GPRS connection in network manager again
2009-11-23T03:33:00.000Z	smik	Amaranth	I have the 9.10 disk. I was just needing a reason to upgrade ;)
