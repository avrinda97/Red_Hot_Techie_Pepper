2005-03-12T14:14:00.000Z	lavigj		is anyone here skilled at extracting data from log files?
2005-03-12T14:14:00.000Z	karsten2	lavigj	man grep
2005-03-12T14:15:00.000Z	lavigj	karsten2	already did and used that. I have a list of logins, but now I am trying to get a list of just the unique ones.
2005-03-12T14:15:00.000Z	karsten2	lavigj	sort -u
2005-03-12T14:15:00.000Z	lavigj	karsten2	instead of 4000 lines of repeating data
2005-03-12T14:15:00.000Z	lavigj	karsten2	ok
2005-03-12T14:17:00.000Z	karsten2	lavigj	You got that?
2005-03-12T14:18:00.000Z	karsten2	lavigj	Yeah.  Sorts input to unique occurances.
2005-03-12T14:18:00.000Z	karsten2	lavigj	If you'd describe what you're doing specifically I can offer better guidance.
2005-03-12T14:18:00.000Z	karsten2	lavigj	awk '/pattern/ {print <columns>}'  | sort -u  is a generally useful recipie.
2005-03-12T14:18:00.000Z	lavigj	karsten2	yeah, and I think it worked, however it is picking up dates as well. basically, I have a file full of login occurences that i grepped from the logfiles for sendmail. I am trying to wind up with just a list of users who have logged into send mail
2005-03-12T14:19:00.000Z	karsten2	lavigj	^^
2005-03-12T14:19:00.000Z	lavigj	karsten2	I will check that
2005-03-12T14:19:00.000Z	karsten2	lavigj	You can cut through your columns with awk or cut.
2005-03-12T14:20:00.000Z	lavigj	karsten2	thanks, I will do some man awk and man cut action and see what I can do
2005-03-12T14:22:00.000Z	karsten2	lavigj	Post if you've got questions.   You can use #flood as well for longer stuff.
2005-03-12T14:23:00.000Z	lavigj	karsten2	thanks, it is greatly appreciated
2005-03-12T14:24:00.000Z	karsten2	lavigj	NP. I'm in middle of stuff, may take a minute to see you.
2005-03-12T14:39:00.000Z	lavigj	karsten2	just so you know, I really appreciate the help with this all, but I (somewhat abashedly) realized it would be easier to import the data into a spreadsheet
2005-03-12T14:46:00.000Z	karsten2	lavigj	You're mistaken ;-)
2005-03-12T14:46:00.000Z	karsten2	lavigj	/join #flood and show me what you're doing.
2005-03-12T14:52:00.000Z	karsten2	lavigj	Stillhere?
