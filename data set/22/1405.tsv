2010-09-03T10:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mehranhu	did you install wubi to an SD card? Your question smells like wubi..
2010-09-03T10:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mehranhu	is this for wubi?
2010-09-03T11:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mehranhu	if you don't answer questions to clarify the situation, we can't help you
2010-09-03T11:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mehranhu	is that a file which is part of wubi?
2010-09-03T11:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mehranhu	use tab to complete nicks dude :)
2010-09-03T11:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mehranhu	so its a file in the android OS?
2010-09-03T11:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mehranhu	if its on an SD card, mount the SD card then just copy it off like any other file
2010-09-03T11:06:00.000Z	mehranhu	ActionParsnip	 : I mounted from SD card. my device boots from sd card and loads u-boot.bin, userdata.img and other such files from SD Card
2010-09-03T11:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mehranhu	if you insert the card it should mount and popup in nautilus and you can copy the files
2010-09-03T11:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mehranhu	if you simply want a file off an SD card, its like no other
2010-09-03T11:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mehranhu	I know how to flash phones with new images. That's all
2010-09-03T11:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mehranhu	i'd ask in an android channel. If you want data off an sd card I can advise but the intricasies of android are offtopic here
