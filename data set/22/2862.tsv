2010-04-03T02:18:00.000Z	meco		How can I report a bug with ntpd?
2010-04-03T02:19:00.000Z	meco		At least I'm getting some help in the Gnome channel, since nobody here is answering.
2010-04-03T02:21:00.000Z	silner	meco	most bugs are reported through launchpad, but you can go upstream to the software devs if you want
2010-04-03T02:21:00.000Z	meco	silner	I was needing help on how to file a bug.
2010-04-03T02:22:00.000Z	silner	meco	https://bugs.launchpad.net/
2010-04-03T02:22:00.000Z	silner		I think there help on how to proceed there meco
2010-04-03T02:25:00.000Z	meco	silner	I'm already trying to follow the instructions on another help page
2010-04-03T02:25:00.000Z	meco		Which is way too complicated
2010-04-03T02:26:00.000Z	silner		What sort of bug are you reporting, in what app meco?
2010-04-03T02:26:00.000Z	meco	silner	ntpd is broken
2010-04-03T02:27:00.000Z	silner	meco	Well what I do it search Launchpad to make sure it hasn't already been reported first of all
2010-04-03T02:28:00.000Z	meco	silner	I'm looking at one bug report now that looks similar, but I'm not very technically literate
2010-04-03T02:30:00.000Z	silner		What is the bug meco? What's happening.
2010-04-03T02:30:00.000Z	meco	silner	The bug report that I'm looking at appears to be the same as mine, but it has been closed without investigation. Can I ask to have it reopened?
2010-04-03T02:31:00.000Z	meco	silner	The PC clock is set one our off when I hook up to the time servers
2010-04-03T02:31:00.000Z	silner		I believe you can ask for reopening meco but I've never tried
2010-04-03T02:32:00.000Z	meco	silner	I'll try that, because the first guy who filed added later that he was unable to reproduce the error, so they closed the case
2010-04-03T02:33:00.000Z	silner	meco	it seems like an odd error I must say. I can't imagine what would cause it. Unrecognised Timezone maybe?
2010-04-03T02:34:00.000Z	meco	silner	Well it's Western Europe..
2010-04-03T02:34:00.000Z	silner		Then I'm utterly without a clue meco :)
2010-04-03T02:35:00.000Z	silner		Good luck anyway meco
2010-04-03T02:36:00.000Z	meco	silner	I clicked on the link on the old bug report about the bug also applying to me. Will my Apport data be appended to the old case then?
