2007-05-27T06:54:00.000Z	Pelo	Fattay	 you can add extra resolutions manualy by editing  xorg.conf
2007-05-27T06:54:00.000Z	Fattay	Pelo	: How do I edit the xorg.conf?
2007-05-27T06:55:00.000Z	Pelo	Fattay	  gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-05-27T06:59:00.000Z	Fattay	Pelo	I added it, and it didn't show up in Screen Resolution.
2007-05-27T06:59:00.000Z	Pelo	Fattay	 you may have to restart X
2007-05-27T07:08:00.000Z	Pelo	Fattay	 hold on
2007-05-27T07:10:00.000Z	Pelo	Fattay	 be patient with me I,m helping in 3 windows
2007-05-27T07:12:00.000Z	Pelo	Fattay	 your problem is just that you need to adjust the horizsync setting in xorg.conf,  that is common with crt screens,   edit xorg.conf again find the correct line and make the ranage  ??-70
2007-05-27T07:14:00.000Z	Pelo	Fattay	did you get my last msg ?
2007-05-27T07:16:00.000Z	Fattay	Pelo	I am in the Ubuntu Recovery Mode. What shall I type to edit the xorg.conf
2007-05-27T07:16:00.000Z	Pelo	Fattay	 sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-05-27T07:18:00.000Z	Fattay	Pelo	In xorg.conf, I have like a ton 4 or 5 lines that say subection "Display" then two lines under it, then EndSubsecion, and then another sbsection display, etc. Isnt there only suppose to be 1 Subsection Display?
2007-05-27T07:19:00.000Z	Pelo	Fattay	 look for horizsynk     23-56 or whastever the numbers are  change it to **-70  ( ** means leave those numbers as is )
2007-05-27T07:20:00.000Z	Fattay	Pelo	Okay, how do I save ths file and reboot?
2007-05-27T07:20:00.000Z	Pelo	Fattay	 I have no idea how to sayve in nano
