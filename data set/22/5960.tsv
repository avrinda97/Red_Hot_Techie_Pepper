2008-07-06T21:07:00.000Z	Enselic		Is it GIMP 2.4 pronounced "GIMP 2 dot 4" or "GIMP 2 point 4"?
2008-07-06T21:09:00.000Z	unop	Enselic	depends where you are from
2008-07-06T21:09:00.000Z	Enselic	unop	I mean for someone that speaks english natiely, what sounds best?
2008-07-06T21:11:00.000Z	unop	Enselic	again, depends where you are from -- here in england, i've known people to say "2point4" or "2dot4" - i prefer the former as it represents a numeric version
2008-07-06T21:12:00.000Z	Enselic	unop	well it doesn't actually; GIMP 2.12 is a later version than GIMP 2.4, so it should not be interpreted as a decimal number
2008-07-06T21:13:00.000Z	unop	Enselic	gimp is weird then
2008-07-06T21:13:00.000Z	Enselic	unop	same goes for Blender, Linux and all other programs I can think of
2008-07-06T21:14:00.000Z	unop	Enselic	i dunno what blender is .. but it's not true of linux .. 2.4 < 2.6,  2.6.18 < 2.6.24, etc
2008-07-06T21:15:00.000Z	Enselic	unop	2.6.18 > 2.6.2
2008-07-06T21:15:00.000Z	Enselic	unop	so same there
2008-07-06T21:15:00.000Z	unop	Enselic	i believe it was 2.6.02 back then
2008-07-06T21:16:00.000Z	Enselic	unop	no, it was 2.6.2 (google and see)
2008-07-06T21:16:00.000Z	Enselic	unop	your world breaks apart now, doens't it ;)
2008-07-06T21:17:00.000Z	unop	Enselic	not really :) i don't perform any arithmetic on these numbers
2008-07-06T21:19:00.000Z	unop	Enselic	break the number down into major release, minor release and revision increment -- then it doesn't have to confuse you - but then again, not all authors/vendors follow this standard of versioning, it depends really (like i said initially)
2008-07-06T21:19:00.000Z	Enselic	unop	I'm not confused at all, I was just wondering how it is pronounced by someone that natievely speaks englsih
2008-07-06T21:20:00.000Z	unop	Enselic	varies from person to person, preference to preference -- but i guess if a gimp developer refers to gimp 2.4 as "gimp 2dot4" then it's officially that
2008-07-06T21:21:00.000Z	Enselic	unop	nah, most GIMP developers doesn't speak English nateivly
2008-07-06T21:23:00.000Z	unop	Enselic	it's not a matter of them speaking english -- it's about them naming their babies, if i were called Juan (and pronounced it with a J) then that's what you really ought to call me, no? :)
2008-07-06T21:24:00.000Z	Enselic	unop	"2 dot 4" is not part of the name though
2008-07-06T21:25:00.000Z	unop	Enselic	call it what you will -- it really is a no-op
2008-09-26T20:14:00.000Z	unop	Enselic	that's to ensure there is no spurious disk access when the kernel is initially loading (bugs, hardware issues, etc) - the kernel remounts the root volume as rw later on in the bootstrap.
