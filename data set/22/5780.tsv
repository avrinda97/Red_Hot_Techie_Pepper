2007-03-28T09:09:00.000Z	crdlb	s0nix	which ati?
2007-03-28T09:10:00.000Z	s0nix	crdlb	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV350 NJ [Radeon 9800 XT
2007-03-28T09:11:00.000Z	crdlb	s0nix	is the fglrx kernel module loaded?
2007-03-28T09:11:00.000Z	s0nix	crdlb	lsmod | grep fglrx ........ fglrx                 481012  0
2007-03-28T09:15:00.000Z	crdlb	s0nix	what makes you think it isn't working?
2007-03-28T09:17:00.000Z	s0nix	crdlb	glxinfo | grep "direct rendering"  -----> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0". & direct rendering: No
2007-03-28T09:17:00.000Z	crdlb	s0nix	what does fglrxinfo say?
2007-03-28T09:18:00.000Z	s0nix	crdlb	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12460/
2007-03-28T09:19:00.000Z	crdlb	s0nix	out of curiosity, was the free driver too slow for you?
2007-03-28T09:20:00.000Z	s0nix	crdlb	it doesnt work at all........ and i need fglrx for my dual screen and beryl
2007-03-28T09:22:00.000Z	crdlb	s0nix	you should be able to use mergedfb with beryl and the free driver, but did you try the commands in the troubleshooting section of the ati driver howto?
2007-03-28T09:23:00.000Z	s0nix	crdlb	im searching it... at the moment
2007-03-28T09:47:00.000Z	s0nix	crdlb	 :(
2007-03-28T09:47:00.000Z	crdlb	s0nix	that didn't work?
2007-03-28T09:48:00.000Z	s0nix	crdlb	i don't understand what's the problem
2007-03-28T09:49:00.000Z	crdlb	s0nix	on the troubleshooting section, it has two commands it suggests running if you only get indirect rendering
2007-03-28T09:50:00.000Z	s0nix	crdlb	ubuntu.com?
2007-03-28T09:50:00.000Z	crdlb	s0nix	which ati card do you have again?
2007-03-28T09:51:00.000Z	crdlb	s0nix	you really should have no trouble with the free drivers
2007-03-28T09:52:00.000Z	crdlb	s0nix	if you come to #ubuntu-effects I may be able to help you in setting them up
