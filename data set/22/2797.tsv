2010-04-10T11:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	banshee_	move your current /etc/X11/xorg.conf* files to a safe location, then run "sudo nvidia-xconfig" then rerun the nvidia-settings and it should save
2010-04-10T11:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	banshee_	there will be an xorg.conf but there may also be an xorg.conf.backup or similar
2010-04-10T11:28:00.000Z	banshee_	ZykoticK9	Where should I move them, im new so i dont know what a safe location would be
2010-04-10T11:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	banshee_	your home directory would be a good spot - would you like the terminal command to do it?
2010-04-10T11:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	banshee_	YES - but instead of using /home use ~ which will map to the correct /home/yourusername
2010-04-10T11:30:00.000Z	banshee_	ZykoticK9	should it echo anything back to me?
2010-04-10T11:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	banshee_	not if it was successful -- so no
2010-04-10T11:31:00.000Z	banshee_	ZykoticK9	ok I did it, now how do I fix that parsing error again?
2010-04-10T11:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	banshee_	on command line - no news is good news
2010-04-10T11:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	banshee_	"sudo nvidia-xconfig" first
2010-04-10T11:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	banshee_	then "gksu nvidia-settings" and try to save
2010-04-10T11:33:00.000Z	banshee_	ZykoticK9	Ok now how do I restart x server so  I can complete this?
2010-04-10T11:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	banshee_	no not really - did the save work?
2010-04-10T11:34:00.000Z	banshee_	ZykoticK9	I think so how do I check?
2010-04-10T11:34:00.000Z	banshee_	ZykoticK9	It didnt error it just asked me where i wanted to save and whatn ot
2010-04-10T11:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	banshee_	did you get the "failed to parse" error?
2010-04-10T11:34:00.000Z	banshee_	ZykoticK9	nope
2010-04-10T11:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	banshee_	then it should have worked :)  I'd make the changes/settings you want, resave, then reboot to test
2010-04-10T11:35:00.000Z	banshee_	ZykoticK9	It says it needs a restart to X server to finish, do I restart my computer?
2010-04-10T11:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	banshee_	might be the easiest thing to do (really i believe you only need to restart Xorg)
