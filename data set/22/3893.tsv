2008-05-03T10:09:00.000Z	opop		i guess i shouldn't consider myself a power user if i can't figure out how to get to the hidden menu items...it just never occurred to me they'd move the darn things.
2008-05-03T10:10:00.000Z	opop		i see.
2008-05-03T10:11:00.000Z	opop		hey, while i'm here, how do i get rid of that retarded evil-face screenlet?  i hate it.
2008-05-03T10:13:00.000Z	jj2k	opop	its a conflict with pulseaudio
2008-05-03T10:13:00.000Z	opop	jj2k	i haven't had any trouble with pulseaudio, interesting
2008-05-03T10:15:00.000Z	jj2k	opop	, naaaaaaa
2008-05-03T10:20:00.000Z	jj2k	opop	no 64
2008-05-03T10:21:00.000Z	jj2k	opop	 not true
2008-05-03T10:22:00.000Z	opop	jj2k	ok, then i must be on an old repository--i'm on osuosl--they tend to keep things pretty current over there.
2008-05-03T10:25:00.000Z	opop	jj2k	what repo is currently carrying wine 0.61?
2008-05-03T10:25:00.000Z	opop	jj2k	0.9.61, rather
2008-05-03T10:25:00.000Z	opop	jj2k	that's what i was saying--it's not in the stable repositories, and he's trying to do something else
2008-05-03T10:26:00.000Z	jj2k	opop	you missed my point tho
2008-05-03T10:26:00.000Z	opop	jj2k	i have pulse, i have wine, everything is fine.
2008-05-03T10:26:00.000Z	opop	jj2k	can't he just kill pulseaudio?
2008-05-03T10:26:00.000Z	opop	jj2k	(now i'm just being contrary)
2008-05-03T10:27:00.000Z	opop	jj2k	what was your point?
2008-05-03T10:28:00.000Z	opop	jj2k	take care!
