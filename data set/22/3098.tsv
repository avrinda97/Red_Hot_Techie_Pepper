2008-12-06T04:52:00.000Z	btoogood	gnutron	what happened
2008-12-06T04:53:00.000Z	gnutron	btoogood	are you referring to my intrepid comment?
2008-12-06T04:53:00.000Z	btoogood	gnutron	yip
2008-12-06T04:54:00.000Z	gnutron	btoogood	only my observation, its seems to be very common, i'm on hardy yet.
2008-12-06T04:55:00.000Z	gnutron	btoogood	i have also seem intrepid change bios settings, thats a bit weird too. :)
2008-12-06T04:55:00.000Z	gnutron	btoogood	seen, not seem. sorry.
2008-12-06T04:55:00.000Z	btoogood	gnutron	seems like it on hardy my system works fine, when i installed intrepid on my machine no network even though it says it has and is connected but on hardy no worries that is what i am on now, as for the bios that is scary
2008-12-06T04:56:00.000Z	gnutron	btoogood	yes, its troubling some ppl have no issues at all!  go figure ;p
2008-12-06T04:57:00.000Z	btoogood	gnutron	same thing when i boot in to the live cd of intrepid same thing hmm
2008-12-06T04:57:00.000Z	gnutron	btoogood	the developers will fix it. bless their souls, until then, i'm waiting to upgrade.
2008-12-06T04:58:00.000Z	btoogood	gnutron	yes same here i think i will wait as well, a bit silly really
2008-12-06T05:52:00.000Z	gnutron	btoogood	never bet on the horses. sorry just kidding.
2008-12-06T05:53:00.000Z	btoogood	gnutron	lol thanks if my ethernet is working in hardy what would the chances be it will work in intrepid if i upgrade via upgrade manager
2008-12-06T05:53:00.000Z	gnutron	btoogood	about 50/50 chances
2008-12-06T05:54:00.000Z	btoogood	gnutron	lol with 100% using hardy hmm it is a big gamble then
2008-12-06T05:56:00.000Z	gnutron	btoogood	yeah, its a gamble i'm not taking and i rarely refuse a challenge.
2008-12-06T05:57:00.000Z	btoogood	gnutron	yip so i wonder if the developers will fix it in the next spin
2008-12-06T06:03:00.000Z	btoogood	gnutron	here is a little quote from ubuntu's web site "Sorry, there probably won't be an 8.10.1. 8.04.1 was put out because 8.04 is a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Non-LTS releases don't get point releases. "
2008-12-06T06:04:00.000Z	gnutron	btoogood	yeah, i knew that. but thanks, i'm sure the channel appreciates the info. :)
2008-12-06T06:06:00.000Z	btoogood	gnutron	not to try a upgrade or not decisions decisions
2008-12-09T03:43:00.000Z	gnutron	btoogood	bluefish is pretty good
2008-12-09T03:44:00.000Z	btoogood	gnutron	i dont know html so that is why kompozer(nvu) is good because it is like dreamweaver
