2007-08-21T08:53:00.000Z	NemesisD		ok so far unsuccessful, can anybody please help me? i can't ssh tunnel my server at work, i can ping it but everything i try in ssh times out, ssh server is confirmed running on the machine (ssh localhost produces no errors) and the router is set to forward
2007-08-21T08:54:00.000Z	p3bkac	NemesisD	how are you tunneling?
2007-08-21T08:54:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	tried just ssh user@ip
2007-08-21T08:55:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	please excuse my poor use of terminology then
2007-08-21T08:56:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	correct, just sits there and times out
2007-08-21T08:56:00.000Z	p3bkac	NemesisD	no worries...just want to make sure I understand so I can hopefully provide some assistance
2007-08-21T08:57:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	using the root account on that system
2007-08-21T08:57:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	could be another confusion of terms, im using the only account created with ubuntu
2007-08-21T08:58:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	it isn't actually root i don't think, like when you set up ubuntu and it gives you the opportunity to create a user, that one
2007-08-21T09:00:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	i told him to use sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start to start ssh
2007-08-21T09:00:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	no ssh server is absolutely installed im positive of that
2007-08-21T09:01:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	not denied per se, it just sits there
2007-08-21T09:02:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	i believe he's at the box
2007-08-21T09:03:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	if it isn't a default package then nope
2007-08-21T09:04:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	i don't know how to do either of those things, ill send him instructions if you tell me how
2007-08-21T09:05:00.000Z	p3bkac	NemesisD	have him run this command "tail -n 100 /var/log/auth.log | grep sshd"
2007-08-21T09:06:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	k sec, gotta text it
2007-08-21T09:08:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	i have no earthly idea
2007-08-21T09:08:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	i know that the server gets internet access
2007-08-21T09:16:00.000Z	p3bkac	NemesisD	it is a little tedious troubleshooting remotely like that.  Just have him email you that logfile then and you can parse it yourself
2007-08-21T09:21:00.000Z	NemesisD	p3bkac	i wish i could continue, but thanks for your help and thank you too dariuskane , hope to see you in here tomorrow ;) im out
2007-08-21T09:22:00.000Z	p3bkac	NemesisD	your welcome...good luck
