2005-12-07T11:50:00.000Z	trappist	MFen	check out isapnptools
2005-12-07T11:50:00.000Z	MFen	trappist	hmm. i guess i'll have to fully install the system for that
2005-12-07T11:51:00.000Z	trappist	MFen	you're sure the driver isn't there?
2005-12-07T11:51:00.000Z	MFen	trappist	no way to know until i know what the chipset is :)
2005-12-07T11:52:00.000Z	trappist	MFen	try 3c515
2005-12-07T11:53:00.000Z	MFen	trappist	no go. 3c59x installed though.
2005-12-07T11:54:00.000Z	trappist	MFen	I've never heard of an unsupported 3com card in linux, so I've got $5 that says the driver's there.  I just checked and ubuntu builds all 3com drivers as modules.
2005-12-07T12:23:00.000Z	MFen	trappist	you're probably right that the driver will be available
2005-12-07T12:23:00.000Z	trappist	MFen	I doubt it's a 3c59x chip
2005-12-07T12:24:00.000Z	MFen	trappist	any idea how i can figure out what it is?
2005-12-07T12:24:00.000Z	trappist	MFen	it's been years since I dealt with isa hardware, and I don't remember much about it :( but I do remember isapnptools coming in handy
2005-12-07T12:29:00.000Z	trappist	MFen	did I mention isapnptools?
2005-12-07T12:30:00.000Z	MFen	trappist	small problem. it's not on the cd.
2005-12-07T12:30:00.000Z	trappist	MFen	that does present a problem.
2005-12-07T12:31:00.000Z	MFen	trappist	but i have a usb drive here.
2005-12-07T12:31:00.000Z	trappist	MFen	any usb ports on that ancient beast?
2005-12-07T12:32:00.000Z	trappist	MFen	check dmesg
2005-12-07T12:59:00.000Z	MFen	trappist	joke's on me
2005-12-07T12:59:00.000Z	trappist	MFen	awesome!
2005-12-07T13:00:00.000Z	MFen	trappist	as soon as i rebooted it was working. ubuntu wins again :)
2006-01-01T12:55:00.000Z	trappist	MFen	a replacement for the protocol?
2006-01-01T12:55:00.000Z	MFen	trappist	something more efficient
