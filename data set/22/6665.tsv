2006-08-27T16:11:00.000Z	lupine_85		hard to say what the problem might be, really
2006-08-27T16:11:00.000Z	lupine_85		KDE runs like a steamer ;)
2006-08-27T16:11:00.000Z	lupine_85		me neither
2006-08-27T16:11:00.000Z	lupine_85		it'll be a configuration issue of some form
2006-08-27T16:12:00.000Z	ladydoor	lupine_85	try swiftfox!
2006-09-11T10:46:00.000Z	ladydoor	lupine_85	right, but he wants me to walk him through its usage, and i've never used it, whereas i'm pretty comfortable giving instructions on source installation
2006-09-11T11:43:00.000Z	ladydoor	lupine_85	++
2006-09-15T08:29:00.000Z	lupine_85	ladydoor	sort of
2006-09-15T08:29:00.000Z	ladydoor	lupine_85	sort of?
2006-09-15T08:30:00.000Z	lupine_85	ladydoor	most things regarding encryption in the US are "sort of" dodgy
2006-09-15T08:30:00.000Z	ladydoor	lupine_85	ah.
2006-09-21T14:11:00.000Z	ladydoor	lupine_85	quotes are not a means of providing emphasis. sorry to be the grammar queen, but there you go.
2006-09-21T14:12:00.000Z	lupine_85	ladydoor	indeed. they're a means of providing quotes
2006-09-22T16:57:00.000Z	ladydoor	lupine_85	can a pirate linux kernel exist? it seems that one cannot pirate free software
2006-09-22T16:57:00.000Z	lupine_85	ladydoor	read the 2.6.18 changelog... (just the top bit, never fear! :) )
2006-09-22T16:58:00.000Z	ladydoor	lupine_85	errrr...i don't believe i have that kernel. are you saying that linux is going closed-source or something?
2006-09-22T16:58:00.000Z	ladydoor	lupine_85	because that wouldn't make sense
2006-09-22T16:58:00.000Z	lupine_85	ladydoor	no. 1 second...
2006-09-22T16:59:00.000Z	lupine_85	ladydoor	http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.18
2006-09-22T05:00:00.000Z	ladydoor	lupine_85	lol. that's funny
2006-09-24T09:52:00.000Z	ladydoor	lupine_85	do you know of a good ogg tag editor for the console, too?
2006-09-24T09:54:00.000Z	ladydoor	lupine_85	thanks
