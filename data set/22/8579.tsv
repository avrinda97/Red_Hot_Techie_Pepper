2005-07-04T05:37:00.000Z	jpie		Hi. Is ubuntu easier to install for newer users? I am having several problems with debian, and no one will guide me to fix them. I tried Ubuntu but was having problems with the installer. If I explain the problem can someone try and tell me what to do?
2005-07-04T05:38:00.000Z	jpie		okeys. Gimme a sec. going to load up the disk.
2005-07-04T05:39:00.000Z	jpie		...
2005-07-04T05:40:00.000Z	jpie		Okay, this is stupid. Now that I installed a bad version of Debian, I have GRUB, and it doesnt check to see if CD-Rom will be bootable. Itj ust goes straight to GRUB and its annoying the crap out of me. Can anyone help? I just need to uninstall GRUB or Debian atleast. I am a complete newbie to linux just trying to test it out on a different comp.
2005-07-04T05:41:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	that has nothing to do with grub
2005-07-04T05:41:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	thats a bios setting
2005-07-04T05:42:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	it still has nothing to do with grub
2005-07-04T05:42:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	it means either your cdrom is bad, or your cdrom is not recognized properly
2005-07-04T05:42:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	grub only gives you the debian options ONCE THE BIOS HAS DECIDED TO BOOT FROM THE HD
2005-07-04T05:43:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	we don't like repeating our selves, primarily because we don't go out of our way to lie to you
2005-07-04T05:44:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	yes, its a bios/hardware/cdrom issue, grub only comes in to give youd ebian ONLY options ONCE THE BIOS BRINGS UP THE HD
2005-07-04T05:44:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	BECAUSE YOUR CDROM ISN'T BEING RECOGNIZED, YOUR CD IS BAD, YOUR CDROM IDE CABLE IS FAULTY
2005-07-04T05:48:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	check yoru cdrom jumper settings, try anoter ide cable
2005-07-04T05:48:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	lots of things can go wrong to trick the bios into not 'seeing' your cdrom of boot partition on the cd it self
2005-07-04T06:06:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	what kind of hardware do you have on your machine?
2005-07-04T06:06:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	i've had one debian install fail for someone in the netherlands on some obscure scsi/mobo related issues
2005-07-04T06:08:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	no scsi hardware?
2005-07-04T06:09:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	scsi hard drive as opposed to ide hard drive, usually its faster, smaller, noisier and more reliable
2005-07-04T06:09:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	just curious, how did you get it to boot of cdrom?
2005-07-04T06:10:00.000Z	jpie	holycow	I flipped the ide cable around to have CDDrive on the end, and HDD in the middle.
2005-07-04T06:10:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	heh, i've had similar situation
2005-07-04T06:15:00.000Z	holycow	jpie	if you select the desktop configuration yes
