2005-05-26T13:15:00.000Z	Lafitte-	neighborlee	 umm     your need is about the same as wanting to remove your car tires without taking off the lug nuts     just funny to me
2005-05-26T13:15:00.000Z	neighborlee	Lafitte-	as I said its not funny when several of the 'mainstream' distros do it the same way as well as  a OS that has 85% market share..you see now ? ;-))
2005-05-26T13:16:00.000Z	neighborlee	Lafitte-	you are funny
2005-05-26T13:16:00.000Z	Lafitte-	neighborlee	  no  they all require you to unmount the volume to eject
2005-05-26T13:17:00.000Z	neighborlee	Lafitte-	bullshit
2005-05-26T13:17:00.000Z	neighborlee	Lafitte-	sorry you dont know what your talking about..

2005-05-26T13:18:00.000Z	neighborlee	Lafitte-	its not how I feel its how several mainstream distros also feel...get a grip ;-)
2005-05-26T13:18:00.000Z	Lafitte-	neighborlee	 i was laughing because its funny   i ddnt tell you to not to pursue your dreams
2005-05-26T13:18:00.000Z	Lafitte-	neighborlee	 another words  relax
2005-05-26T13:22:00.000Z	Lafitte-	neighborlee	what distro allows you to do that ?
2005-05-26T13:23:00.000Z	neighborlee	Lafitte-	suse, mandrake ( now mandriva), knoppix, xandros, linspire to name a few <G>
2005-05-26T13:23:00.000Z	Lafitte-	neighborlee	 i would go use one of those  and join there channel  and find another pointless argumnt for them
2005-05-26T13:24:00.000Z	neighborlee	Lafitte-	I choose ubuntu because I find it meets my need and philosophy..all of this is simply over wish to use eject like the other ones do as I find it desireable/easier
2005-05-26T13:25:00.000Z	neighborlee	Lafitte-	slander will get you nowhere in this channel
2005-05-26T13:25:00.000Z	Lafitte-	neighborlee	 slander ???   you need to get an education
2005-05-26T13:25:00.000Z	neighborlee	Lafitte-	stop being childdish or face being kicked or banned
2005-05-26T13:26:00.000Z	neighborlee	Lafitte-	I have the right to discuss without being attacked
