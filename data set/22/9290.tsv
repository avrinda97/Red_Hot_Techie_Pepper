2007-11-03T04:30:00.000Z	kjm		can someone here assist me getting ssh server working?
2007-11-03T04:31:00.000Z	guru	kjm	sudo apt-get install sshd
2007-11-03T04:32:00.000Z	guru	kjm	sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
2007-11-03T04:32:00.000Z	guru	kjm	anything in dmesg or /var/log/?
2007-11-03T04:34:00.000Z	guru	kjm	that's odd. can you ping the machine from another host?
2007-11-03T04:36:00.000Z	guru	kjm	you already have something running on port 22
2007-11-03T04:36:00.000Z	guru	kjm	you can't ping the host?
2007-11-03T04:37:00.000Z	guru	kjm	sudo iptables -t net --list
2007-11-03T04:37:00.000Z	guru	kjm	see if there is anything listed there for port 22
2007-11-03T04:39:00.000Z	guru	kjm	did you find anything?
2007-11-03T04:40:00.000Z	guru	kjm	i'd say you have something really funky going on...are you trying to ssh into the machine running sshd from outside the LAN or from within the LAN?
2007-11-03T04:42:00.000Z	guru	kjm	do you have more than one nic installed on the sshd server?
2007-11-03T04:43:00.000Z	guru	kjm	what is the broadcast address?
2007-11-03T04:44:00.000Z	guru	kjm	that's correct. that's dhcp related stuff
2007-11-03T04:45:00.000Z	guru	kjm	kjm are you locally on the machine where sshd is installed?
2007-11-03T04:45:00.000Z	guru	kjm	ping google.com
2007-11-03T04:45:00.000Z	guru	kjm	i suspect networking is not working
2007-11-03T04:46:00.000Z	guru	kjm	ahh ok. i presumed that you were chatting from another [nearby] machine
2007-11-03T04:47:00.000Z	guru	kjm	try restarting sshd : /etc/init.d/ssh restart
2007-11-03T04:48:00.000Z	guru	kjm	i'm afraid i'm out of ideas
2007-11-03T04:49:00.000Z	guru	kjm	neither have i except for minor typos in the config
2007-11-03T04:51:00.000Z	guru	kjm	heh, that would have been my next suggestion
