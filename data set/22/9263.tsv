2005-04-25T12:17:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fazer	...
2005-04-25T12:18:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fazer	And you're not getting any help from me, either. :P
2005-04-25T12:18:00.000Z	Fazer	Amaranth	I didn't ask for your help
2005-04-25T12:18:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fazer	1) Because that was annoying and 2) because I don't know sh!t about USB. :)
2005-08-06T08:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fazer	You can't.
2005-08-06T08:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fazer	Installing msttcorefonts will get you andale mono, arial black, arial, comic sans, courier new, georgia, impact, times new roman, trebuchet, verdana, and webdings
2005-08-06T08:54:00.000Z	Fazer	Amaranth	But Agamotto suggested something...
2005-08-06T08:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fazer	And admitted he was wrong less than a minute later. :)
2005-08-06T08:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fazer	You can copy it from a windows install, sure.
2005-08-06T09:02:00.000Z	Fazer	Amaranth	oh sweet, where do I copy it to though?
2005-08-06T09:02:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fazer	Open nautilus, hit Ctrl-L, and type 'fonts:///'
2005-08-06T09:02:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fazer	Drag and drop them in there.
2005-08-06T09:02:00.000Z	Fazer	Amaranth	Ah sweet, thanks
2005-08-06T09:03:00.000Z	Fazer	Amaranth	I think I will have to do this in Gnome because I am using Xfce
