2007-07-30T14:26:00.000Z	Rex		hi all.
2007-07-30T14:27:00.000Z	Rex		can someone tell me how to map a drive to a samba share? I can't figure it out. I need to do this so that I can import or manage photos with F-Spot
2007-07-30T14:29:00.000Z	ShackJack	Rex	Can you just "bookmark" the drive in Nautilus then use "Places" in F_Spot?
2007-07-30T14:29:00.000Z	Rex	ShackJack	I will try that
2007-07-30T14:31:00.000Z	Rex	ShackJack	it doesn't add it to places? Would you know the path to that folder?
2007-07-30T14:31:00.000Z	ShackJack	Rex	Yeah, it should add - bookmark... You have to switch to places in nautilus to see it...
2007-07-30T14:31:00.000Z	ShackJack	Rex	You can see path when surfing in naautilus - smb://path.t/folder
2007-07-30T14:32:00.000Z	Rex	ShackJack	you mean places is F-Spot? It does not list it. I can't figure out how to browse to that bookmarked path.
2007-07-30T14:33:00.000Z	ShackJack	Rex	there should be drop down to list places - you can see in nauitlus browser places, no?... You can also go to Places->Network in Nautilus and bookmark
2007-07-30T14:35:00.000Z	ShackJack	Rex	File->Open in F-Spot doesn't give you dialog with Places?
2007-07-30T14:35:00.000Z	Rex	ShackJack	 I can see it there, but I can't see how to browse to smb://192.168.0.1/Image%20Expert%20Images in F-Spot.
2007-07-30T14:36:00.000Z	ShackJack	Rex	Can't just pick from file->open dialog?
2007-07-30T14:37:00.000Z	Rex	ShackJack	it lists my other places there, but not any SMB connections.
2007-07-30T14:37:00.000Z	ShackJack	Rex	So it doesn't have the place you just added in there? Weird?
2007-07-30T14:37:00.000Z	Rex	ShackJack	by other places I mean physical and logical disks... but no SMB shares.
2007-07-30T14:38:00.000Z	ShackJack	Rex	You can find address in nautilus...
2007-07-30T14:38:00.000Z	Rex	ShackJack	I tried restarting F-Spot too... no go... I am stumped... I also tried pasting the addy into F-Spot
2007-07-30T14:44:00.000Z	Rex	ShackJack	yes I can see the address in Nautilus.
2007-07-30T14:47:00.000Z	ShackJack	Rex	Sorry don't have in front - I assumed you can surf to any places in nautilus - can't imaging why it's not thee...
2007-07-30T14:47:00.000Z	Rex	ShackJack	ok.. thanks for trying.
2007-07-30T14:53:00.000Z	Rex	ShackJack	just in case you were curious, it turns out that I may have to define the share permanantly in fstab. Ugh.
2007-07-30T14:53:00.000Z	ShackJack	Rex	:)
