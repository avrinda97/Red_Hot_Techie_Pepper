2005-07-24T16:12:00.000Z	funkyHat	orangerange	the point of having an ubuntu repository is so those of us that are lazy don't have to do much work to keep up to date :P

2005-07-24T05:01:00.000Z	orangerange	funkyHat	i'm signing up with memebot.com now. Looks nice!
2005-07-24T05:02:00.000Z	orangerange	funkyHat	with memebot around, why would anyone choose geocities or one of those websites-services? 8-)
2005-07-24T05:03:00.000Z	funkyHat	orangerange	because no-one has heard of it, and hopefully they won't, i don't want them to stop their service or start charging ;)

2005-07-24T05:07:00.000Z	funkyHat	orangerange	are you using the oddmuse wiki?
2005-07-24T05:08:00.000Z	orangerange	funkyHat	what's that? a memebot service? If so, i'm still registering! I'm slow, because I have the typing break applet running; it forces me off the PC every so often.
2005-07-24T05:09:00.000Z	funkyHat	orangerange	yes it's a wiki that memebot will automate the installation of for you
2005-07-24T05:10:00.000Z	orangerange	funkyHat	it will install something on my computer?
2005-07-24T05:11:00.000Z	orangerange	funkyHat	i can't believe they require our phone number! is this for real?
2005-07-24T05:12:00.000Z	funkyHat	orangerange	i didn't remember that, just put a fake one in if you're worried. they don't phone you anyway
2005-07-24T05:12:00.000Z	orangerange	funkyHat	gotcha. is there some WYSIWYG html/webpage editor for ubuntu? something like MS FrontPage, I guess?
