2008-04-11T12:14:00.000Z	lankke		Hey guys/gals, I am having trouble with my dual boot system. I have ubuntu on one drive, xp on the other and the setup was working perfectly up until a couple of weeks ago. I removed the linux hard drive so that I could perform a data recovery on a friend's broken windows hard drive. When I put the linux hard drive back in, ubuntu would freeze right after the grub bootloader
2008-04-11T12:16:00.000Z	bwayne	lankke	  try booting into a livecd and restoring grub from there.
2008-04-11T12:18:00.000Z	lankke	bwayne	... okay mate. You think it's a problem with grub then?
2008-04-11T12:19:00.000Z	bwayne	lankke	 more than likely grub as it is installed is looking for a place that doesn't exist.  re-installing grub may fix the issue.  shutting off the drive in the BIOS and then turning it back on (boo sequence I mean) may resolve the issue as well.
2008-04-11T12:19:00.000Z	bwayne	lankke	 GRUB errors are manifold.  many points of failure.  we'd have to get more specific to really trouble-shoot
2008-04-11T12:21:00.000Z	lankke	bwayne	Well I get this weird msg if I turn off quiet boot... something like ata.01: Emask ...
2008-04-11T12:21:00.000Z	bwayne	lankke	 that's greek to me, my friend.  re-installing grub couldn't hurt though.
2008-04-11T12:23:00.000Z	lankke	bwayne	the livecd is taking me to a shell like prompt (initramfs): and the same error is being displayed
2008-04-11T12:24:00.000Z	bwayne	lankke	  you mean, you're booting from a livecd and you're getting the exact error as if you were trying to boot from hard disk grub menu?
2008-04-11T12:28:00.000Z	bwayne	lankke	  if you reply to me, be sure to put my name 'bwayne' in the text somewhere so i'll see it.
2008-04-11T12:28:00.000Z	lankke	bwayne	yeah so the live cd won't even work now
2008-04-11T12:29:00.000Z	lankke	bwayne	i'm getting stuck at the same point
2008-04-11T12:29:00.000Z	bwayne	lankke	 does your BIOS 'hit' the cd drive?  Does it attempt to read the drive and then fail?  OR just it just hang there like some sort of mindless idiot?
2008-04-11T12:31:00.000Z	lankke	bwayne	well in the bios settings, the drive is detected properly, the problem comes just after the grub bootloader
2008-04-11T12:31:00.000Z	lankke	bwayne	it loads for a bit... then stops when it hits that message
2008-04-11T12:33:00.000Z	lankke	bwayne	if I try booting the gui it gets stuck on the first notch on the loading bar but if i boot it in text mode, the error is repeated until eventually i end up at the weird shell prompt, happens with the livecd and with the hard drive
2008-04-11T12:35:00.000Z	bwayne	lankke	 so booting from a livecd produces a progress bar that hangs?  sorry if my questions seem repetitive, just trying to place some context around your input.  :-)
2008-04-11T12:37:00.000Z	lankke	bwayne	booting from the disk drive produces a progress bar that hangs, booting from the live cd produces a progress bar which moves side to side... in both cases, after a while the gui cuts to a "busybox" shell prompt
2008-04-11T12:38:00.000Z	bwayne	lankke	 try another livecd, if you have another one.  i say to do this to test whether or not it's a problem with that particular livecd.  maybe another one will work.
2008-04-11T12:38:00.000Z	lankke	bwayne	alright mate, I'll give it a try
2008-04-11T12:38:00.000Z	lankke	bwayne	thanks for your help
2008-04-11T12:39:00.000Z	bwayne	lankke	 hope i'm actually helping.  :-)
