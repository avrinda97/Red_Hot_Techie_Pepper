2008-11-22T22:28:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	OxDeadC0de	Xorg.0.log shows DRI loads properly
2008-11-22T22:31:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de		hey dr_willis
2008-11-22T22:41:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	OxDeadC0de	sorry, nuked xorg, the group and mode doesn't help
2008-11-22T22:41:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de		militantpotato crap >< umm, is your user part of the "video" group?
2008-11-22T22:43:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	OxDeadC0de	don't seem to have a video group
2008-11-22T22:43:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de		anyone here use ati cards that had problems getting dri to work but now it works? MilitantPotato is having troubles, his xorg.log says dri loaded but glxinfo says direct rendering: no
2008-11-22T22:44:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	OxDeadC0de	libgl1-mesa-dri is installed, aswell as x11proto-xf86dri-dev, would that be a problem?
2008-11-22T22:45:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	MilitantPotato	how did you install the ati drivers? through the restricted hardware manager? (Jockey)?
2008-11-22T22:46:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	OxDeadC0de	yes, I should mention, I had an Nvidia card installed previous to this, I've removed all the nvidia packages, aswell as all other video drivers aside from FGLRX
2008-11-22T22:46:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de		militantpotato ahh that sounds like the problem, I bet there are some remenants of the nvidia driver (perhaps the glx part)
2008-11-22T22:47:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	OxDeadC0de	I did try the latest FGLRX from ATI's website, but they failed to load, defaulted to Mesa
2008-11-22T22:48:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de		militantpotato in a terminal: aptitude search nvidia, do any of them say "i" at the front? (for installed)
2008-11-22T22:48:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		P's and V's
2008-11-22T22:50:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de		militantpotato from a terminal can you do "apt-get install pastebinit" then cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | pastebinit ?
2008-11-22T22:50:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de		then copy/paste the link
