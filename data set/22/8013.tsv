2006-06-26T13:11:00.000Z	animato		krang
2006-06-26T13:11:00.000Z	animato		and change it's settings
2006-06-26T13:11:00.000Z	animato		it's only gonna work for that user
2006-06-26T13:11:00.000Z	animato		hey, i have a strange problem
2006-06-26T13:12:00.000Z	animato		just include them all on the same group i think
2006-06-26T13:13:00.000Z	animato		whenever i install the nvidia drivers for my graphic card, my screensaver stops responding. i mean i set it to 5 mins, and it won't work
2006-06-26T13:13:00.000Z	animato		i mean create one
2006-06-26T13:14:00.000Z	animato		i dunno
2006-06-26T13:14:00.000Z	animato		but maybe if you set it for one user on that group, it would apply to all of them?
2006-06-26T13:14:00.000Z	animato		can anyone please help me with my problem? :(
2006-06-26T13:14:00.000Z	andi5	animato	what is it?
2006-06-26T13:16:00.000Z	andi5	animato	what does "stop responding" mean?
2006-06-26T13:17:00.000Z	andi5	animato	is the order of setting and installing important here?
2006-06-26T13:18:00.000Z	andi5	animato	did you choose a 3d screen saver and your 3d support is not configured correctly yet?
2006-06-26T13:21:00.000Z	andi5	animato	so the whole configuration dialog works but the screensaver never starts?
2006-06-26T13:22:00.000Z	andi5	animato	i am sorry, but i do not seem to be able to help you :(
2006-06-26T13:24:00.000Z	andi5	animato	maybe you can tell me why gdm has a physical x resolution different from the logical resolution? (i have to "scroll" to see all buttons) :-D
2006-06-26T13:27:00.000Z	andi5	animato	well, in gnome i have 1024x768, but the first resolution in my xorg conf modeline was bigger (gdm took that one), so i wrote 1024x768 to the front... now x has indeed 1024x768 as resolution, but i can scroll 1280x1024 pixels (gdm is 1280 pixels wide) (scroll=move mouse to the right)
2006-06-26T13:28:00.000Z	andi5	animato	yes, never had problems
2006-06-26T13:30:00.000Z	andi5	animato	you mean slow? .... no not really
2006-06-26T13:33:00.000Z	andi5	animato	maybe some weird (many) extensions? ;-)
2006-06-26T13:44:00.000Z	andi5	animato	edgy == 06.12 or 06.10?
