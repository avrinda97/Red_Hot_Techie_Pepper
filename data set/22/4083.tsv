2008-05-16T14:56:00.000Z	natalisushka		Guys, anyone knows how to connect to a VPN connection in command-line (already set with network-manager-pptp)
2008-05-16T14:56:00.000Z	natalisushka		?
2008-05-16T14:57:00.000Z	DistroJockey	natalisushka	I use  vpnc  (but it may be Cisco specific)
2008-05-16T15:00:00.000Z	DistroJockey	natalisushka	I use it to vpn to my work. It is a cli thing.
2008-05-16T15:01:00.000Z	DistroJockey	natalisushka	Comand Line Interface
2008-05-16T15:01:00.000Z	DistroJockey	natalisushka	what you need basically :)
2008-05-16T15:02:00.000Z	DistroJockey	natalisushka	true :)
2008-08-13T15:02:00.000Z	DistroJockey	natalisushka	did your   /etc/hosts   file change?
2008-08-13T15:03:00.000Z	natalisushka	DistroJockey	How do I know if it changed? and what do you mean by that? What can happen if it changed?
2008-08-13T15:04:00.000Z	DistroJockey	natalisushka	date stamp will tell you. Bad  /etc/hosts  file can cause long startup delays for some programs
2008-08-13T15:04:00.000Z	natalisushka	DistroJockey	actually my system hangs for a long time while booting. I don't know why! How can I fix that?
2008-08-13T15:05:00.000Z	DistroJockey	natalisushka	depends on the messages you get from   dmesg
2008-08-13T15:06:00.000Z	natalisushka	DistroJockey	can you please explain? I am not familar with dmesg
2008-08-13T15:06:00.000Z	natalisushka	DistroJockey	I used it in termial and got a big list of I don't know what!
2008-08-13T15:06:00.000Z	DistroJockey	natalisushka	look for EE in  dmesg (run from terminal)
2008-08-13T15:07:00.000Z	natalisushka	DistroJockey	What is EE?
2008-08-13T15:07:00.000Z	DistroJockey	natalisushka	EE = error
2008-08-13T15:08:00.000Z	DistroJockey	natalisushka	probably :)
2008-08-13T15:08:00.000Z	natalisushka	DistroJockey	I did it, doesn't seem to have found EE: "[    0.000000] ACPI: DSDT 3BEAC408, 3AEE (r1 TOSINV    SB450  6040000 MSFT  100000E)"
2008-08-13T15:09:00.000Z	natalisushka	DistroJockey	I mean that's the only line I get with dmesg | grep EE
2008-08-13T15:09:00.000Z	natalisushka	DistroJockey	However, using "dmesg | grep error" shows : "[   26.104332] ACPI: Looking for DSDT in initramfs... error, file /DSDT.aml not found."
2008-08-13T15:10:00.000Z	DistroJockey	natalisushka	you can also check the timestamp beside the messages to see when stuff happens
