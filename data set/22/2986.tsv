2009-01-07T16:07:00.000Z	Arenlor	w00b3	try sudo srm -vr /media/disk-1
2009-01-07T16:09:00.000Z	w00b3	Arenlor	http://paste.ubuntu.com/101593/
2009-01-07T16:10:00.000Z	Arenlor	w00b3	disk-1 is what a USB thumb drive?
2009-01-07T16:11:00.000Z	Arenlor	w00b3	try to umount it first
2009-01-07T16:13:00.000Z	Arenlor	w00b3	try the command mount and see what it actually is you'll have a line like: /dev/sdb1 on /media/disk-1 type ext3 (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=hal)
2009-01-07T16:13:00.000Z	w00b3	Arenlor	what???
2009-01-07T16:15:00.000Z	Arenlor	w00b3	run "sudo mount", you'll get a list of all mounted file systems, one of them will say something like /dev/sdb1 on /media/disk-1, you need to know what the /dev/sd*# part is
2009-01-07T16:17:00.000Z	Arenlor	w00b3	never mind just thought, are you trying to clear the contents of the USB drive?
2009-01-07T16:18:00.000Z	Arenlor	w00b3	try "srm -r /dev/sdb1/*"
2009-01-07T16:19:00.000Z	Arenlor	w00b3	note, it could take a very long time based on how fast your computer is and how much data there is to delete
2009-01-07T16:22:00.000Z	Arenlor	w00b3	try "cd /media/disk-1" then "srm -r *"
2009-01-07T16:24:00.000Z	Arenlor	w00b3	try using sudo with both commands
2009-01-07T16:25:00.000Z	Arenlor	w00b3	"sudo cd /media/disk-1" doesn't work?
2009-01-07T16:26:00.000Z	w00b3	Arenlor	of course not
2009-01-07T16:26:00.000Z	w00b3	Arenlor	but i know of another way
2009-01-07T16:26:00.000Z	Arenlor	w00b3	"sudo su" then "cd /media/disk-1" lastly "srm -r *"
2009-01-07T16:33:00.000Z	Arenlor	w00b3	did using "sudo su" work?
2009-01-07T16:34:00.000Z	w00b3	Arenlor	NO
2009-01-07T16:34:00.000Z	Arenlor	w00b3	just type exit
2009-01-07T16:36:00.000Z	Arenlor	w00b3	I use it all the time, I'm a bit confused as the problem going on here
