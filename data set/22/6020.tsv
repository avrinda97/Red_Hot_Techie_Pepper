2008-10-12T06:28:00.000Z	douglas		Please, how can I go somewhere to talk about C language and compilers on ubuntu?
2008-10-12T06:28:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	douglas	There isn't anywhere specific for that; you can try here though
2008-10-12T06:29:00.000Z	douglas	IntuitiveNipple	thanks. I'm starting to learn how to program in C
2008-10-12T06:30:00.000Z	douglas	IntuitiveNipple	In the college the teacher only showed us how to compiler using dev C++ on windows
2008-10-12T06:34:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	douglas	I use the Eclipse CDT for Ubuntu kernel development
2008-10-12T06:35:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	douglas	You might also want to try anjuta
2008-10-12T06:37:00.000Z	douglas	IntuitiveNipple	I'm still learning c language, what do u recomend for me?
2008-10-12T06:38:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	douglas	The IDE you're most comfortable with, and *lots* of API documentation nearby, either web-sites or off-line copies of the APIs documentation you're using, and a *good* C/C++ language guide
2008-10-12T06:43:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	douglas	Have you created a 'Makefile' for your project?
2008-10-12T06:44:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	douglas	The Makefile needs a 'default:' or 'all;' target
2008-10-12T06:46:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	douglas	http://tjworld.net/wiki/Programming/C/ExamplePrintArgsAndEnv
2008-10-12T06:46:00.000Z	douglas	IntuitiveNipple	And how do I proceed? :/
2008-10-12T06:46:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	douglas	Learn about GNU make, and Makefiles
2008-10-12T06:47:00.000Z	douglas	IntuitiveNipple	on this URL there is information about these?
2008-10-12T06:48:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	douglas	Just an example of a basic hello-world C program that prints the environment and args
2008-10-12T06:50:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	douglas	I highly recommend you get something like this: http://www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/DummiesTitle/productCd-0764506919,page-1.html
2008-10-12T06:54:00.000Z	douglas	IntuitiveNipple	okay I'll take a look on that page, thanks
2008-10-12T07:07:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	douglas	It depends on the IRC client you're using.
2008-10-12T07:07:00.000Z	douglas	IntuitiveNipple	It's XChat
2008-10-12T07:08:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	douglas	You might want to look here, though: http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2008/10/12/
2008-10-12T07:08:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	douglas	I think xchat is logging by default, to ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/
2008-10-12T07:12:00.000Z	douglas	IntuitiveNipple	nice! thank you
