2010-02-16T17:18:00.000Z	peope		Which kernel should I use to have a 64bit ubuntu version access > 4gb ram?
2010-02-16T17:19:00.000Z	peope		Problem is it only shows 4gb ram although I have 8gb
2010-02-16T17:20:00.000Z	inveratulo	peope	does your bios show that it recognizes all the ram?
2010-02-16T17:20:00.000Z	peope	inveratulo	yes. And it dual boots into vista 64 bit and shows 8 gb
2010-02-16T17:21:00.000Z	inveratulo	peope	Can we see your "uname -a" ?
2010-02-16T17:22:00.000Z	inveratulo	peope	and "free -m" ?
2010-02-16T17:23:00.000Z	inveratulo	peope	try "free -m |grep -i mem" for one line :-P
2010-02-16T17:23:00.000Z	peope	inveratulo	"Mem:          3956       2343       1612          0        124        454"
2010-02-16T17:23:00.000Z	peope	inveratulo	^^
2010-02-16T17:25:00.000Z	peope	inveratulo	any ideas? I'm puzzled
2010-02-16T17:26:00.000Z	inveratulo	peope	yea i was looking around... seems odd. one sec
2010-02-16T17:27:00.000Z	inveratulo	peope	can you pastebin "sudo dmidecode|head -n 300"
2010-02-16T17:29:00.000Z	inveratulo	peope	sorry that's a lot of stuff, just looking towards the top where it shows the memory slots
2010-02-16T17:30:00.000Z	peope	inveratulo	http://www.peope.net/tmp.txt
2010-02-16T17:32:00.000Z	inveratulo	peope	I'm stumped.  your memory is recognized.  what does "top" show?  what first gave you the impression the OS wasn't showing you had 8gb of ram?
2010-02-16T17:33:00.000Z	peope	inveratulo	Mem:   4051180k total,  2417016k used,  1634164k free,   128540k buffers
2010-02-16T17:38:00.000Z	inveratulo	peope	you booted from the same kernel right?
2010-02-16T17:38:00.000Z	peope	inveratulo	I think so... but it would be logical if I didn't.
2010-02-16T17:39:00.000Z	inveratulo	peope	yea.  I cannot rationalize why, given what you told us before, it wasn't working
2010-02-16T17:40:00.000Z	peope	inveratulo	that is comforting at least :)
2010-02-16T17:40:00.000Z	inveratulo	peope	maybe its time to go play the lottery :-p
2010-02-16T17:40:00.000Z	peope	inveratulo	lol
