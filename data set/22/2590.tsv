2009-05-03T23:43:00.000Z	TurtlePie	caimlas	are you talking about kubuntu?
2009-05-03T23:44:00.000Z	caimlas	TurtlePie	for my problem?
2009-05-03T23:44:00.000Z	caimlas	TurtlePie	or wrt helder?
2009-05-03T23:45:00.000Z	caimlas	TurtlePie	oh, re: meta packages? no, that applies to all desktop environments.
2009-05-03T23:45:00.000Z	caimlas	TurtlePie	ubuntu is a steaming pile of sludge.
2009-05-03T23:46:00.000Z	TurtlePie	caimlas	i wouldnt say that, what do you mean?
2009-05-03T23:46:00.000Z	caimlas	TurtlePie	getting really irritated with all these 'breaks' in new releases (or for that matter, long after release).
2009-05-03T23:47:00.000Z	TurtlePie	caimlas	do you not like Ubuntu?
2009-05-03T23:47:00.000Z	caimlas	TurtlePie	usually not after a new release, no.
2009-05-03T23:48:00.000Z	TurtlePie	caimlas	do you like Ubuntu 7 or 8 then?
2009-05-03T23:48:00.000Z	caimlas	TurtlePie	I tell myself "oh, maybe this one will be different! I'm hearing good things!" but all of that is lies. invariably, something is broken with the release in an existential way.
2009-05-03T23:48:00.000Z	caimlas	TurtlePie	I liked 6 and 7
2009-05-03T23:49:00.000Z	caimlas	TurtlePie	I like the later releases to an extent. there are just a lot of little irritations wrt things working.
2009-05-03T23:49:00.000Z	caimlas	TurtlePie	Xlib:  extension "XFree86-Misc" missing on display ":0.0". <-- occurs when I use xset.
2009-05-03T23:50:00.000Z	TurtlePie	caimlas	thats part of the open source feel, you should be ued to it, and have you ever instlaled fedora, it is full of those little problems
2009-05-03T23:51:00.000Z	caimlas	TurtlePie	no, I jumped ship from the RPM nightmare about 10 years ago.
2009-05-03T23:51:00.000Z	caimlas	TurtlePie	I used debian from 98 to 06 or so.
2009-05-03T23:52:00.000Z	caimlas	TurtlePie	ubuntu devs are getting sloppy (and so are the kernel devs). this "rolling release" nonsense is starting to result in some really crappy code.
2009-05-03T23:52:00.000Z	TurtlePie	caimlas	no worrys, you should fix the bug a be part of the bug squad etc...........
2009-05-03T23:52:00.000Z	caimlas	TurtlePie	any idea which package I should report that as? :P
2009-05-03T23:53:00.000Z	caimlas	TurtlePie	I've got half a dozen bugs right now.
2009-05-03T23:54:00.000Z	TurtlePie	caimlas	work on one and let other know about the rest.
