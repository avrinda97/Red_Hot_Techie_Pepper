2011-02-07T17:47:00.000Z	luckymurali		sipior,yes
2011-02-07T17:48:00.000Z	sipior	luckymurali	had you modified the apt repository list beforehand?
2011-02-07T17:48:00.000Z	luckymurali		no
2011-02-07T17:48:00.000Z	luckymurali		but i deleted that .so file
2011-02-07T17:48:00.000Z	sipior	luckymurali	what necessitated reinstalling libstdc++?
2011-02-07T17:48:00.000Z	sipior	luckymurali	wait. which .so file?
2011-02-07T17:49:00.000Z	luckymurali		i deleted that libstdc++.so.6 file
2011-02-07T17:49:00.000Z	sipior	luckymurali	well that wasn't very clever.
2011-02-07T17:50:00.000Z	luckymurali		:(
2011-02-07T17:50:00.000Z	sipior	luckymurali	can you remove the package?
2011-02-07T17:50:00.000Z	luckymurali		no not able to goto synaptic manager also
2011-02-07T17:51:00.000Z	sipior	luckymurali	you've got the package. you could pull the library out of that, and move it into place manually.
2011-02-07T17:52:00.000Z	luckymurali		yes
2011-02-07T17:53:00.000Z	sipior	luckymurali	try "dpkg-deb -x <package> <target directory>"
2011-02-07T17:54:00.000Z	luckymurali	sipior	I dont have that package
2011-02-07T17:54:00.000Z	luckymurali		not able to download also
2011-02-07T17:54:00.000Z	sipior	luckymurali	it's probably still in /var/cache/apt/archives. have a look there.
