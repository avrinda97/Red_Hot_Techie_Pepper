2006-01-10T11:13:00.000Z	phreak97		hey, is there any chance i could use a windows driver via wine?
2006-01-10T11:13:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	phreak97	not really
2006-01-13T07:28:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	phreak97	A complete reinstall of what?
2006-01-13T07:28:00.000Z	phreak97	PuMpErNiCkLe	 VLC
2006-01-13T07:29:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	phreak97	In synaptic, there's an option when you right-click on a package "Mark for reinstallation".
2006-01-13T07:29:00.000Z	phreak97	PuMpErNiCkLe	 tried
2006-01-13T07:29:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	phreak97	What happened?
2006-01-13T07:30:00.000Z	phreak97	PuMpErNiCkLe	 it reinstalled, then when i ran it, it still had almost no gui'
2006-01-13T07:30:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	phreak97	"Almost" no GUI?
2006-01-13T07:30:00.000Z	phreak97	PuMpErNiCkLe	want a screenshot?
2006-01-13T07:31:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	phreak97	Yeah, sure - put it in the pastebin.

2006-01-13T07:35:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	phreak97	That's about the same as I get from VLC when I just open it - it's just a very minimalist interface.
2006-01-13T07:36:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	phreak97	So unless it won't actually play music/movies for you (supported formats, I mean) I don't see it as a bug.
2006-01-13T07:38:00.000Z	phreak97	PuMpErNiCkLe	i'd like to be able to start a video over again without reopening it
2006-01-13T07:39:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	phreak97	It doesn't show a pause / FF /RW button when it's playing media?
2006-01-13T07:41:00.000Z	phreak97	PuMpErNiCkLe	no, thats the problem
2006-01-13T07:42:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	phreak97	sure, let me know if it fixes it
2006-01-13T07:43:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	phreak97	I'll check to see if anyone else has reported the same problem.
2006-01-13T07:51:00.000Z	phreak97	PuMpErNiCkLe	no good
2006-01-13T08:08:00.000Z	phreak97	PuMpErNiCkLe	 uninstalled, restarted gnome, reinstalled, all works
2006-01-13T09:41:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	phreak97	I got your message - awesome!
