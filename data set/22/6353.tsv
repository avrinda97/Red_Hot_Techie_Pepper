2007-07-16T14:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	How is it "lost"?
2007-07-16T14:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	So you just need to re mount it?
2007-07-16T14:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	So to mount it do: sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/newname
2007-07-16T14:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	If you want to have it mount automatically at boot edit your /etc/fstab
2007-07-16T14:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	No output?
2007-07-17T05:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	Is everything turned up and unmuted in alsamixer?
2007-07-17T05:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	run "alsamixer" from a terminal, arrow keys to move around / change volume "m" key to mute / unmute
2007-07-17T05:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	And unmuted?
2007-07-17T05:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	It will say "MM" at the bottom
2007-07-17T05:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	Does it hae a green OO at the bottom then?
2007-07-17T05:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	If you have multiple sound cards try the output from the other one
2007-07-17T05:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	Just look for any other sound outputs on your box
2007-07-17T05:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	Your computer
2007-07-17T05:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	yES
2007-07-17T05:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	If you want to use your other card see if it is listed in "asoundconf list"
2007-07-17T05:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	I don't know, if that is what you think is the card you want then yes
2007-07-17T05:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	asoundconf -set-default-card <name>
2007-07-17T05:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	actually there is no "-" before set
2007-07-17T05:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	x89x	np :)
