2010-09-13T16:49:00.000Z	Paddy_NI		Would any of you know how I can disable plymouth and just have a verbose boot?
2010-09-13T16:49:00.000Z	Paddy_NI		oh nice
2010-09-13T16:50:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Paddy_NI	no, it will boot to getty, a text login
2010-09-13T16:52:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Paddy_NI	Please don't try to play around with plymouth, people have messed up their systems horribly by trying to remove it
2010-09-13T16:52:00.000Z	Paddy_NI	bilalakhtar	I know it depends on so much but I would rather just disable it from starting not remove it
2010-09-13T16:53:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Paddy_NI	hmm
2010-09-13T16:53:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Paddy_NI	What is the exact problem with plymouth?
2010-09-13T16:54:00.000Z	Paddy_NI	bilalakhtar	^
2010-09-13T16:54:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Paddy_NI	I have a method, which version of UBuntu are you running?
2010-09-13T16:55:00.000Z	Paddy_NI	bilalakhtar	oddly it displays perfectly when shutting down
2010-09-13T16:55:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Paddy_NI	which graphic card? Intel?
2010-09-13T16:57:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Paddy_NI	hmm, I prefer you to leave your ystem as-is
2010-09-13T16:58:00.000Z	Paddy_NI	bilalakhtar	cant I blacklist plymouth or something?
2010-09-13T16:58:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Paddy_NI	There is a method, but be warned: Proceed at your own risk. Go to the /etc/init folder and rename the plymouth-splash.conf file to plymouth-splash.conf.disabled .
2010-09-13T16:59:00.000Z	Paddy_NI	bilalakhtar	of okay what is the severity of the warning :)
2010-09-13T17:00:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Paddy_NI	It worked for me, though, since I am a Linux power user I am fearless with such stuff, but I don't like to wreck other's computers
2010-09-13T17:00:00.000Z	Paddy_NI	bilalakhtar	ah okay cheers mate
2010-09-13T17:00:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Paddy_NI	I mean to say, if there is some problem and you're dropped to a command line
2010-09-13T17:00:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Paddy_NI	then just go and type this command:
2010-09-13T17:01:00.000Z	Paddy_NI	bilalakhtar	oh no worries I am know the drill
2010-09-13T17:01:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Paddy_NI	^^
2010-09-13T17:01:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Paddy_NI	That will set the settings back for ya
