2008-06-08T20:00:00.000Z	amenado	Jue	what was my question earlier?  what brand? chip?
2008-06-08T20:00:00.000Z	Jue	amenado	it was what wifi i had
2008-06-08T20:02:00.000Z	Jue	amenado	I am new to all this and half of what your saying doesnt make no sense to me.
2008-06-08T20:02:00.000Z	amenado	Jue	i can emphatize, but asking what brand should be easy to read from that command, you have to do some legwork too

2008-06-08T20:04:00.000Z	amenado	Jue	yes, now what chip? use the pastebin for results of sudo lshw -C network
