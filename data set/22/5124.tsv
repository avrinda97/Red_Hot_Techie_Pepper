2007-07-16T08:50:00.000Z	blubloblu		Hi everyone, I've messed up my wireless configuration and I need a step-by-step guide to restore settings to what they are on a fresh install. Any help would be appreciated

2007-07-16T08:52:00.000Z	blubloblu	summer_s4	yeah, did that. Wireless device doesn't appear
2007-07-16T08:52:00.000Z	summer_s4	blubloblu	does it say wireless connection?
2007-07-16T08:52:00.000Z	blubloblu	summer_s4	no, just dial-up and wired
2007-07-16T08:54:00.000Z	blubloblu	summer_s4	did you ask me to restart?
2007-07-16T08:55:00.000Z	summer_s4	blubloblu	yes.  While it is restarting, make sure the wireless cord is plugged in right.
2007-07-16T08:55:00.000Z	summer_s4	blubloblu	don't open the computer
2007-07-16T08:55:00.000Z	blubloblu	summer_s4	ok
2007-07-16T08:55:00.000Z	summer_s4	blubloblu	If it is USB make sure it is connected right
2007-07-16T08:58:00.000Z	blubloblu	summer_s4	ok. I booted in recovery mode, nothing out of the ordinary appeared, no errors
2007-07-16T08:59:00.000Z	blubloblu	summer_s4	what should I do now?
2007-07-16T09:03:00.000Z	blubloblu	summer_s4	can you tell me what I should do to clean up my wireless settings?

2007-07-16T09:05:00.000Z	blubloblu	summer_s4	it seems to work when I'm in recovery mode
2007-07-16T09:05:00.000Z	summer_s4	blubloblu	well... copy the code
2007-07-16T09:06:00.000Z	summer_s4	blubloblu	paste the code into any text manager
2007-07-16T09:08:00.000Z	blubloblu	summer_s4	what code?
