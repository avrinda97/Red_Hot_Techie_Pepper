2006-07-18T16:13:00.000Z	helpme		Saveas: why did you ban me, I pasted the file like you asked???!
2006-07-18T16:13:00.000Z	jrib	helpme	he meant paste it on the pastebin website: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2006-07-18T16:14:00.000Z	helpme	jrib	how was I supposed to know that, sorry, but I'm a new comer here, a warning and recommendation first would have been nice...
2006-07-18T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	helpme	usually you are just banned to stop the scrolling, he probably just forgot to unmute you afterwards, but you should talk with him or just forget about it and try to get help again
2006-07-18T16:16:00.000Z	helpme	jrib	i'll try again. I cannot get java to install, apt-get install sun-java5-jre fails. I've updates /etc/apt/sources.list with universe and re-ran apt-get update but still no joy....
2006-07-18T16:17:00.000Z	jrib	helpme	you actually need multiverse, not universe
2006-07-18T16:17:00.000Z	helpme	jrib	I uncommented four lines in that file, two for universe and the other I believe were multiverse (the ones with comments before about uncommenting)
2006-07-18T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	helpme	you probably uncommented the dapper-backports multiverse.  But first, are you running dapper?
2006-07-18T16:19:00.000Z	helpme	jrib	running 6.06 LTS download a week or two ago
2006-07-18T16:19:00.000Z	jrib	helpme	k, go ahead and put your /etc/apt/sources.list on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ , then give us the URL here
2006-07-18T16:21:00.000Z	helpme	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/18241
2006-07-18T16:22:00.000Z	jrib	helpme	ok, try this without the quotes, 'gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list', and then add " multiverse" to the end of lines 19,20, 34, and 35
2006-07-18T16:27:00.000Z	helpme	jrib	you are a star! seems to be working now....
2006-07-18T16:27:00.000Z	jrib	helpme	great
2006-07-18T16:28:00.000Z	helpme	jrib	I take it I should revert back to the original sources.list to be safe for future updates?
2006-07-18T16:29:00.000Z	jrib	helpme	no, those are fine, I'll have the bot send you a link explaining them so you can decide for yourself
2006-07-18T16:32:00.000Z	helpme	jrib	thanks again for your assistance, bye.
2006-07-18T16:32:00.000Z	jrib	helpme	np, bye
2008-12-14T09:01:00.000Z	jrib	helpme	what fonts?
2011-01-18T04:42:00.000Z	jrib	helpme	deleting things in your home will not affect your ability to install things
2011-01-18T04:43:00.000Z	jrib	helpme	what are you trying to install?  How are you trying?  What exactly happens when you try?  (please answer all of these questions, not just some)
2011-01-18T04:45:00.000Z	jrib	helpme	one sec -- phone
