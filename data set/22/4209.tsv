2009-02-06T19:55:00.000Z	elhoir		can anyone help?
2009-02-06T19:55:00.000Z	n8tuser	elhoir	-> umm wouldnt you just remove and de-install to cleanse of such driver?
2009-02-06T19:56:00.000Z	elhoir	n8tuser	- i have already done that
2009-02-06T19:59:00.000Z	elhoir	n8tuser	- any idea, please? (you or anyone else)
2009-02-06T19:59:00.000Z	n8tuser	elhoir	-> you have verified the modules or driver has been removed or de-installed? what command you used to verify?
2009-02-06T20:00:00.000Z	elhoir	n8tuser	- i followed steps from here -> https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/674/9206/0/www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/linux_cat91-inst.pdf
2009-02-06T20:01:00.000Z	n8tuser	elhoir	-> am not going to read just because you post the link.. tell us exactly what you have done..
2009-02-06T20:02:00.000Z	elhoir	n8tuser	- "With superuser permissions, enter the command "sh ./fglrx-uninstall.sh" "
2009-02-06T20:03:00.000Z	n8tuser	elhoir	-> now look inside that script to see if it really removed it, or use  lsmod to verify
2009-02-06T20:05:00.000Z	n8tuser	elhoir	-> also it seems you are trying to use an rpm package?
2009-02-06T20:07:00.000Z	elhoir	n8tuser	- lsmod shows the module installed, but because im using it right now
2009-02-06T20:07:00.000Z	n8tuser	elhoir	-> but you claimed you have un-installed it, so which one is it?
2009-02-06T20:08:00.000Z	n8tuser	elhoir	-> well if your claim it slows you down, why not remove it so you can see the difference afterwards?
2009-02-06T20:08:00.000Z	elhoir	n8tuser	- okay, i will uninstall now, be back in minutes
2009-02-06T20:17:00.000Z	elhoir	n8tuser	- okay, i uninstalled modules, verifyed by "lsmod | grep fglrx"
2009-02-06T20:17:00.000Z	n8tuser	elhoir	-> okay, how is the perf now?
2009-02-06T20:18:00.000Z	elhoir	n8tuser	- seems to be quite good, normal
2009-02-06T20:22:00.000Z	elhoir	n8tuser	- .... and now? :)
2009-02-06T20:23:00.000Z	n8tuser	elhoir	-> if you are happy with the speed, -- if aint borked..dont mess with it?  :P
2009-02-06T20:23:00.000Z	elhoir	n8tuser	- lol , well, i would agree i i could play games without 3D
2009-02-06T20:24:00.000Z	n8tuser	elhoir	-> sorry im not a gamer, cant assist you much with 3D drivers
