2006-02-28T06:34:00.000Z	pianoboy3333		Is there a way in firefox (1.5.0.1) to extend the bookmarks toolbar so there is two rows, or to make another bookmarks toolbar?
2006-02-28T06:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	pianoboy3333	 check out firefox.com/extensions there might be something there
2006-02-28T06:36:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	IdleOne	ok
2006-02-28T06:36:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	IdleOne	It's mozilla.com/extensions
2006-03-03T11:43:00.000Z	IdleOne	pianoboy3333	 sudo aptitude -purge xfce4
2006-03-03T11:44:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	IdleOne	No tengo aptitude
2006-03-03T11:45:00.000Z	IdleOne	pianoboy3333	 usas sudo apt-get remove xfce4
2006-03-03T11:45:00.000Z	IdleOne	pianoboy3333	 si quieres te lo dogi in francais tan bien :P
2006-03-03T11:45:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	IdleOne	it says it's not installed
2006-03-03T08:48:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	IdleOne	No one there is helping me...
2006-07-08T07:39:00.000Z	IdleOne	pianoboy3333	I believe the guest account defaults to a blank pasword
2006-07-08T07:40:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	IdleOne	wait... how do you make a guest account that defs. to a blank password? I went System->admin.->users and groups in gnome, and did one manually!
2006-07-08T07:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	pianoboy3333	try login in to the guest account..if it didnt ask you to set a pass then it should be blank
2006-07-08T07:41:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	IdleOne	it did ask me to set a pass...
2006-07-08T07:41:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	IdleOne	how do you set up one w/o one?
2006-07-08T07:42:00.000Z	IdleOne	pianoboy3333	you can try leaving it blank when setting up the user account . not sure if that works though
2006-07-08T07:42:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	IdleOne	no, that doesn't
2006-07-08T07:42:00.000Z	IdleOne	pianoboy3333	then set a pass make it something easy like " guest " or " hello " ....
2006-07-08T07:43:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	IdleOne	yea... I was just wondering how the live cd works...
2006-07-08T07:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	pianoboy3333	the live cd is hard coded with the default pass. you have the source :) hack it
2007-02-19T13:47:00.000Z	IdleOne	pianoboy3333	search synaptic for guitar should give you a few apps
2007-02-19T13:47:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	IdleOne	I don't think it's one of those
