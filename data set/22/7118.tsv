2006-12-11T11:20:00.000Z	ThePub	drcode	you want to add a sudo user?
2006-12-11T11:20:00.000Z	ThePub	drcode	add the new user to the admin group and logout then back in.
2006-12-11T10:31:00.000Z	ThePub	drcode	samba is probably the easiest :)
2006-12-11T10:31:00.000Z	ThePub	drcode	probably, but xp comes with an nfs client
2006-12-11T10:32:00.000Z	drcode	ThePub	it will work with linux?
2006-12-11T10:32:00.000Z	ThePub	drcode	you can use samba to mount windows shares under linux
2006-12-11T10:32:00.000Z	ThePub	drcode	they can even be setup in your fstab iirc
2006-12-11T10:33:00.000Z	ThePub	drcode	unless you told it not to, it should be installed.
2006-12-11T10:33:00.000Z	ThePub	drcode	but otherwise, yeah, just install samba
2006-12-11T10:33:00.000Z	ThePub	drcode	oh, idk about .06 :)  .10 I had to tell it no ;)
2006-12-11T10:34:00.000Z	drcode	ThePub	 what use linux to linux?
2006-12-11T10:34:00.000Z	ThePub	drcode	it really doesn't matter.. you can use samba for linux to linux too.
