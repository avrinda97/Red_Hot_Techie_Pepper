2007-09-02T09:01:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		I have no idea why my menus are drawn so slowly... I think I'll just do format and reinstall. If I have a several months old "Ubuntu 7.04" cd should I bother downloading a new one?
2007-09-02T09:02:00.000Z	alext	Ar-Pharazon	have you checked the swap?
2007-09-02T09:02:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	alext	What might be wrong with the swap? It's twice my RAM, i. e. 2 GB, and usually quite empty.
2007-09-02T09:03:00.000Z	alext	Ar-Pharazon	My swap got turned off when i messed with some partitions and everything got really slow
2007-09-02T09:04:00.000Z	alext	Ar-Pharazon	you can check in System Monitor and Gparted
2007-09-02T09:05:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	alext	Well, I messed with my partition and everything got erased, while I don't think my swap is turned off I read from HDD a lot. And I can see the menus and windows slowly being drawn. And text is slow.
2007-09-02T09:06:00.000Z	alext	Ar-Pharazon	just check in system monitor if swap is activated
2007-09-02T09:07:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	alext	It says Used swap: 0 bytes of 1.9 GB
2007-09-02T09:07:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	alext	Where would I activate it?
2007-09-02T09:07:00.000Z	alext	Ar-Pharazon	great, then thats the problem
2007-09-02T09:07:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	alext	It is?
2007-09-02T09:08:00.000Z	alext	Ar-Pharazon	did you move your swap partition and now your hibernation is not working either?
2007-09-02T09:08:00.000Z	alext	Ar-Pharazon	if so, you are in for a TREAT :D It takes some effort to fix
2007-09-02T09:08:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	alext	I didn't try hibernating and I didn't touch swap after creating it during install
2007-09-02T09:09:00.000Z	alext	Ar-Pharazon	ok ill try to find this link i used to get it working, just a sec. You can do the command "swapon" to activate, but to permanently fix it takes some effort. And be careful! Dont do swapon on the wrong partition!
2007-09-02T09:10:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	alext	"swapon: /dev/sda1: Device or resource busy"
2007-09-02T09:11:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	alext	Oh, also, when I right click sda1 in gparted "swapoff" shows up.
2007-09-02T09:11:00.000Z	alext	Ar-Pharazon	you sure that sda1 is swap? Sound a bit fishy to me but you probably know
2007-09-02T09:11:00.000Z	alext	Ar-Pharazon	check this out http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=456992
2007-09-02T09:12:00.000Z	alext	Ar-Pharazon	you can do swapon in gparted by right clicking aswell
2007-09-02T09:12:00.000Z	alext	Ar-Pharazon	gotta go to solve my own problems, that thread should help you. good luck!
2007-09-02T09:12:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	alext	Ok, thanks
