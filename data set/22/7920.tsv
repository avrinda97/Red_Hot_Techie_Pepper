2005-12-19T09:42:00.000Z	sethk	sklav	I've had good results recently with a thinkpad, as duncan_cragg said, also with one from fujitsu and one from dell.  I think the IBM is the best of the three.
2005-12-19T09:43:00.000Z	sklav	sethk	cool i will take your advice
2005-12-19T09:43:00.000Z	sethk	sklav	of course there are tons of others that I haven't tested.
2005-12-19T09:43:00.000Z	sethk	sklav	hp may well work.  I hate their keyboards so I ignore them.
2005-12-22T16:43:00.000Z	sethk	sklav	difficult, or at the very least, very tedious.  Why would you want to do that?  If you want red hat, run red hat
2005-12-28T10:13:00.000Z	sklav	sethk	i use ubuntu as my router
2005-12-28T10:13:00.000Z	sethk	sklav	networks contain multiple routers
2005-12-28T10:14:00.000Z	sklav	sethk	could it be the hotplug causing the issue?
2005-12-28T10:15:00.000Z	sklav	sethk	could it be the hotplug causing the issue?
2005-12-28T10:15:00.000Z	sethk	sklav	well, sort of.  Probably more correct to say that hotplug is fixing the problem after activate
2005-12-28T10:19:00.000Z	sklav	sethk	/ dabaR here is my network interfaces file
2005-12-28T10:22:00.000Z	sethk	sklav	I just pulled it up now
