2006-09-11T14:26:00.000Z	ompaul	usli	be careful, most things you want don't need that
2006-09-11T14:26:00.000Z	ompaul	usli	you do
2006-09-11T14:27:00.000Z	usli	ompaul	what do u mean?
2006-09-11T14:27:00.000Z	ompaul	usli	what is it you are trying to install?
2006-09-11T14:27:00.000Z	usli	ompaul	is that ok for me to install that?
2006-09-11T14:29:00.000Z	ompaul	usli	I know what it is supposed to do so it should be okay, you may need to type >> sudo sh file.sh << if and Only if it wants root permissions
2006-09-11T14:29:00.000Z	ompaul	usli	so start with sh foo.sh
2006-09-11T14:30:00.000Z	ompaul	usli	we can't approve of you using such software
2006-09-11T14:30:00.000Z	ompaul	usli	start with sh file.sh - question why use that when you have a perfectly good office suite on the machine
2006-09-11T14:32:00.000Z	usli	ompaul	is there any application to open visio in ubuntu?
2006-09-11T14:32:00.000Z	ompaul	usli	no
2006-09-11T14:33:00.000Z	usli	ompaul	is that correct?
2006-09-11T14:33:00.000Z	ompaul	usli	yes, and if that fails you type sudo file.sh and if that rootkits your machine you have no one to blame but yourself
2006-09-11T14:34:00.000Z	ompaul	usli	you said it was cracked
2006-09-11T14:35:00.000Z	ompaul	usli	it is always too risky
2006-09-11T14:35:00.000Z	ompaul	usli	now you have enough information so please go do whatever
2006-09-11T14:37:00.000Z	usli	ompaul	do u know how to uninstall wine?
2006-09-11T14:38:00.000Z	ompaul	usli	sudo apt-get remove --purge wine
2006-09-11T14:39:00.000Z	ompaul	usli	although in the channel I am not always looking at this channel or even irc - best to ask the channel -you will get a faster answer
