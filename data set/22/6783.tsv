2006-08-01T15:31:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Warbo	google say: export LC_ALL=C and then startx
2006-08-01T15:32:00.000Z	Warbo	TheGateKeeper	I have to restart X? Damn it
2006-08-01T15:33:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Warbo	no pain, no gain :-)
2006-08-01T15:33:00.000Z	Warbo	TheGateKeeper	I will just use Amarok then, but that takes loads of resources (funny that, sicne Listen is Python :))
2006-08-01T15:35:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Warbo	there are quite a few google entries on the subject
2006-08-01T15:36:00.000Z	Warbo	TheGateKeeper	It worked fine before, and the only major thing I can think of is my 1.3GB clearout of packages. Listen may have badly set dependencies and I've got rid of a package it needs
2006-08-01T15:38:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Warbo	what about a reinstall?
2006-08-01T15:38:00.000Z	Warbo	TheGateKeeper	Of the entire system or just Listen?
2006-08-01T15:39:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Warbo	no just Listen
2006-08-01T15:39:00.000Z	Warbo	TheGateKeeper	Oh. Doing it now
2006-08-01T15:41:00.000Z	Warbo	TheGateKeeper	It is usually a good idea to re-enable the right repositories when trying to reinstall an app :) Silly me
2006-08-01T15:41:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Warbo	has been known to help :-)
2006-08-01T15:43:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Warbo	I keep asking M$ for a 'read my mind' button on visual studio but so far no luck :-(
2006-08-01T15:43:00.000Z	Warbo	TheGateKeeper	I'm getting a 404 for the repo. Does it work for you? "deb http://theli.free.fr/packages/dapper/ ./"
2006-08-01T15:44:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Warbo	me too :-(
2006-08-01T15:44:00.000Z	Warbo	TheGateKeeper	Then I'm off to find some mirrors
2006-08-01T15:45:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Warbo	this works: deb http://theli.free.fr/packages/ dapper listen on their web page
2006-08-01T15:46:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Warbo	http://listengnome.free.fr/
2006-08-01T15:46:00.000Z	Warbo	TheGateKeeper	Thanks, I'll try it
2006-08-01T15:48:00.000Z	Warbo	TheGateKeeper	Repo works thanks, now trying Listen again
2006-08-01T15:48:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Warbo	excellent good luck :-)
2006-08-01T15:55:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	Warbo	time for me to sling my hook, if all else fails give google a go :-) hope you succeed :-)
