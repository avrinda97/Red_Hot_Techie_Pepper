2008-05-01T05:05:00.000Z	somethingcomplex		I started downloading 8.04 (not the live CD, but through the update manager) and.. it froze. Anyone have any idea what to do?
2008-05-01T05:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	somethingcomplex	 you tryed to update GUtsy?
2008-05-01T05:06:00.000Z	somethingcomplex	sebsebseb	yes
2008-05-01T05:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	somethingcomplex	ok if it was downloading then it was downloading, this means nothing was installed
2008-05-01T05:07:00.000Z	somethingcomplex	sebsebseb	really? (it's stuck at "installing upgrades) .. should i just reboot then?
2008-05-01T05:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	somethingcomplex	I  updated a computer earlier,   (this being my second time updating to Hard
2008-05-01T05:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb		how many updates has it installed?
2008-05-01T05:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	somethingcomplex	 can you open the update manager again?
2008-05-01T05:09:00.000Z	somethingcomplex	sebsebseb	no, no programs will open.. and I don't know how many updates it's installed, but it stuck at just 7 min left
2008-05-01T05:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb		nothing about a partial upgrade?
2008-05-01T05:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	somethingcomplex	 nothing about a partial upgrade?
2008-05-01T05:10:00.000Z	somethingcomplex	sebsebseb	no, it doesn't say anything in particular, it's just frozen
2008-05-01T05:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	somethingcomplex	 have you got a Live CD?   just in case  there is a boot up problem of some sort after re boot.  I mean it seems to me that re booting is your only option if it has frozen.  and then hopeing that it will come up saying there are updates  and then you install those yeah
2008-05-01T05:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	somethingcomplex	 it was frozen on downloading packages or installing them?
2008-05-01T05:13:00.000Z	somethingcomplex	sebsebseb	i have got a live CD, luckily enough.. stuck on the"installing upgrades step"
2008-05-01T05:13:00.000Z	somethingcomplex		i'm not! mine's dead :)
2008-05-01T05:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	somethingcomplex	 ok with 7 minutes  from the end,  well  that probably means most stuff was installed.  however not quite everything,  but if you do re boot,  you can probably just boot up some kernel and  get the last updates.   if on the other hand for some reason there is a boot up problem,  at least then you got a Live CD and can come back here or something for help
2008-05-01T05:15:00.000Z	somethingcomplex	sebsebseb	..what would i do to get the last updates?
2008-05-01T05:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	somethingcomplex	if it works after re boot,  the update manager will probably come up saying there are some more updates.  click on that and it will say a prtical upgrade was done probably,  then you can download the remaining updates
2008-05-01T05:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	somethingcomplex	 also it might still say a new version is avaialbe  if so best to use that
2008-05-01T05:16:00.000Z	somethingcomplex	sebsebseb	oh, ok. i thought i might have to do something special. thank-you for your help!!
2008-05-01T05:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	somethingcomplex	yeah no problem
