2009-05-04T07:18:00.000Z	coleys_	sebsebseb	gnome logo in xubuntu.
2009-05-04T07:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	coleys_	oh you themeed xubuntu,  not even sure how to do that,  haven't used xubuntu that much
2009-05-04T07:19:00.000Z	coleys_	sebsebseb	Yeah I prefer lightweight, But I also use emerald + compiz soo... =p
2009-05-04T07:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	coleys_	ha ha yeah IRSSI is nice and light waight.  and that's avant window manager at the bottom I assume?  apparntlly  Caioro dock is better
2009-05-04T07:20:00.000Z	coleys_	sebsebseb	Yeah, with glass theme
2009-05-04T07:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	coleys_	I haven't themed xubuntu before
2009-05-04T07:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	coleys_	now that I seen  Xubuntu can look  quite a lot nicer than the default Xubuntu, well it's something I might try and do, if I knew how to install themes into it
2009-05-04T07:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	coleys_	on Gnome at the moment :)
2009-05-04T07:21:00.000Z	coleys_	sebsebseb	Pretty simple, less gui... but if you know where to put gtk themes and icons and such you'll be good.
2009-05-04T07:21:00.000Z	coleys_	sebsebseb	If you needed any assistance with that, feel free to ask =)
2009-05-04T07:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	coleys_	sure remind  me where to put themes
2009-05-04T07:22:00.000Z	coleys_	sebsebseb	~/.themes ... ~/.icons
2009-05-04T07:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	coleys_	ok
2009-05-04T07:22:00.000Z	coleys_	sebsebseb	Those are the home folder places to put themes, and icons
2009-05-04T07:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	coleys_	yeah I know about home :)
