2009-06-03T17:49:00.000Z	Cheery	eremite	open console
2009-06-03T17:50:00.000Z	eremite		AC console?
2009-06-03T17:50:00.000Z	Cheery	eremite	gnome-terminal
2009-06-03T17:50:00.000Z	eremite		ok, done
2009-06-03T17:50:00.000Z	Cheery	eremite	glxinfo | grep "direct rendering"
2009-06-03T17:51:00.000Z	Cheery	eremite	it should say either direct rendering: Yes or No
2009-06-03T17:51:00.000Z	eremite		It says YES
2009-06-03T17:51:00.000Z	eremite	Cheery	it says yes
2009-06-03T17:52:00.000Z	Cheery	eremite	then it's feeling tricky.
2009-06-03T17:52:00.000Z	eremite	Cheery	what do you mean, feeling tricky?
2009-06-03T17:53:00.000Z	Cheery	eremite	well, you have accelerated graphics there, therefore the game must lag because of non-video problem
2009-06-03T17:53:00.000Z	Cheery	eremite	I'd next bet sound problems.
2009-06-03T17:54:00.000Z	eremite	Cheery	why wouldnt it work out of the box, like it did with Wubi?
2009-06-03T17:55:00.000Z	Cheery	eremite	well, it may pick up a wrong sound frontend
2009-06-03T17:56:00.000Z	eremite	Cheery	what does that mean, and how do I remedy it?
2009-06-03T17:56:00.000Z	Cheery	eremite	I don't know, try change game configs
2009-06-03T17:58:00.000Z	Cheery	eremite	try whether any other opengl game works
2009-06-03T17:58:00.000Z	Cheery	eremite	that way you can yet make it sure
2009-06-03T17:58:00.000Z	eremite	Cheery	I get 24fps with a resolution of 640x400 with all settings at lowest.
