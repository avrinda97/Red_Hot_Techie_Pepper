2009-01-28T21:00:00.000Z	scunizi		!hello | learner
2009-01-28T21:01:00.000Z	scunizi		magical, have you booted into a live usb stick?
2009-01-28T21:02:00.000Z	scunizi		!enter | dft
2009-01-28T21:02:00.000Z	dft	scunizi	I'm describing a situation
2009-01-28T21:03:00.000Z	scunizi	dft	doesn't matter.. if you use enter a lot nobody will be able to follow you..
2009-01-28T21:04:00.000Z	scunizi	dft	as for the mount problem does it show the usb stick as an icon that looks like it has a line on the front face of it?
2009-01-28T21:04:00.000Z	dft	scunizi	no
2009-01-28T21:05:00.000Z	scunizi	dft	and it does't matter where on the pc the usb is plugged in?
2009-01-28T21:05:00.000Z	dft	scunizi	exactly
2009-01-28T21:06:00.000Z	scunizi	dft	have you tried manually mounting and unmounting it?
2009-01-28T21:06:00.000Z	dft	scunizi	not today, brb
2009-01-28T21:08:00.000Z	dft	scunizi	that works, but now I two icons in nautilus showing the disk
2009-01-28T21:08:00.000Z	scunizi	dft	try unmounting now and see if both go away
2009-01-28T21:10:00.000Z	dft	scunizi	one icon dropped but the original is still there,  contextual menus only allow me unmount and when I try it tells me it's not mounted.
2009-01-28T21:11:00.000Z	scunizi	dft	this one's got me stumped too.. weird..
2009-01-28T21:12:00.000Z	dft	scunizi	restarting nautilus hasn't helped either
2009-01-28T21:12:00.000Z	scunizi	dft	which version of ubuntu?
2009-01-28T21:13:00.000Z	dft	scunizi	8.04LTS
2009-01-28T21:13:00.000Z	dft	scunizi	brb
2009-01-28T21:13:00.000Z	scunizi	dft	you might delete the files in ~/.nautilus .. but don't delete any actual directories inside of that but you can delete the files in the directory(s)
2009-01-28T21:14:00.000Z	scunizi	dft	also .. is this machine an upgrade from Gutsy?
2009-01-28T22:20:00.000Z	dft	scunizi	fixed my issue, hopefully permanently with some fstab magic and UUID
