2005-11-15T16:25:00.000Z	dell500		does anyone else have problems with random quits in apps in breezey?
2005-11-15T16:26:00.000Z	refuze2looze	dell500	which apps?
2005-11-15T16:26:00.000Z	dell500	refuze2looze	sometimes gaim, sometimes my clock, sometimes firefox
2005-11-15T16:27:00.000Z	refuze2looze	dell500	i have no problem with gaim and the clock, but firefox exits for me when i change from a page that contains streaming media (which i solved but i guess your problem is different)
2005-11-15T16:28:00.000Z	dell500	refuze2looze	ya, i'm not sure why it does it though, my memory is at 100% though, which kind of frightens me
2005-11-15T16:30:00.000Z	refuze2looze	dell500	which program is using all the memory?
2005-11-15T16:30:00.000Z	dell500	refuze2looze	java, java_vm, nautilus, and firefox-bin
2005-11-15T16:31:00.000Z	dell500	refuze2looze	310mb,230mb, 148mb, 116mb respectively
2005-11-15T16:31:00.000Z	dell500	refuze2looze	um i just fixed that, hold on let me find it real quick
2005-11-15T16:33:00.000Z	refuze2looze	dell500	that's weird... firefox is using 111 for me but nautilus only 40.. what is java running for?
2005-11-15T16:33:00.000Z	dell500	refuze2looze	facebook for picture upload
2005-11-15T16:34:00.000Z	dell500	refuze2looze	i think it's because i'm viewing a bunch of pictures in a folder
2005-11-15T16:35:00.000Z	refuze2looze	dell500	that still doesn't explain the weird crashing of gaim and nautilus.. are you using breezy?
2005-11-15T16:35:00.000Z	refuze2looze	dell500	by the way how did you fix the 'do not disconnect' with the ipod
2005-11-15T16:36:00.000Z	dell500	refuze2looze	i'm lookin' for it real quick, my cable is slow
2005-11-15T16:37:00.000Z	refuze2looze	dell500	thanks
2005-11-15T16:51:00.000Z	dell500	refuze2looze	i'm sorry this is takin' so long, i kinda lost it  again lol
2005-11-15T16:53:00.000Z	refuze2looze	dell500	i managed to get rid of the 'do not disconnect' by remounting it and instead of umount using eject
2005-11-15T16:53:00.000Z	refuze2looze	dell500	you don't remmeber how you did it?
2005-11-15T16:55:00.000Z	dell500	refuze2looze	well there is a way of making it disconnect properly if you quit out of gtkpod, like it does it automatically
