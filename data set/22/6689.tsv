2006-08-20T09:01:00.000Z	cyber3		hello everyone
2006-08-20T09:01:00.000Z	cyber3		I have a cybercafe, and want to put some linux machines
2006-08-20T09:01:00.000Z	cyber3		I choosed ubuntu
2006-08-20T09:02:00.000Z	cyber3		is there any way to block the desktop from a windows 2000 os..?
2006-08-20T09:02:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	I'm not sure what you mean
2006-08-20T09:02:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	you mean you want to lock the desktop after a timeout?
2006-08-20T09:03:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	yes, you can do this.   you set it up in the screensaver configuration
2006-08-20T09:03:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	but what do you mean by "from a win2k"?
2006-08-20T09:05:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	you mean that you run a program on one win2k machine to lock desktops on other machines running xp?
2006-08-20T09:05:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	I don't know of anything built in to do that.  It would be easy enough to write a program to do it.
2006-08-20T09:30:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	yes
2006-08-20T09:31:00.000Z	cyber3	sethk	Do you what command to use..?
2006-08-20T09:31:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	I'll look.  I know it's possible, although I haven't done it for a few months
2006-08-20T09:32:00.000Z	cyber3	sethk	cybercronos@hotmail.com if you find how.. thanks..
2006-08-20T09:33:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	you use the xlib function XLockDisplay and XUnlockDisplay
2006-08-20T09:33:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	if you have X dev packages installed, do   man XLockDisplay
2006-08-20T09:36:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	are you asking about what I said about X dev packages?
2006-08-20T09:36:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	it's at the X level, not the gnome level
2006-08-20T09:36:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	and you do it with a call to XLockDisplay.  The documentation for XLockDisplay is  in the X dev packages
2006-08-20T09:37:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	if you run synaptic, and, in the search dialog, enter    x   dev     (that is, x, space, dev)  you'll get packages with both x and dev in the name
2006-08-20T09:38:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	for the command that richiefrich told you, the packages is xscreensaver-gnome
2006-08-20T09:39:00.000Z	sethk	cyber3	that should pull in other required packages as dependencies
