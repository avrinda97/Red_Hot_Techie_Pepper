2009-01-16T15:27:00.000Z	koshar2	sajuuk_	source files >tar to temr archive somewhere > untar the destination dir, actually you may be able to use the destination drive as the temp tar location,

2009-01-16T15:29:00.000Z	koshar2	sajuuk_	i dont know the tar switches to preserve permissions and timestamps,
