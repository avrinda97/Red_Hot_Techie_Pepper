2005-09-29T08:10:00.000Z	IceDragon		I have a file (cedega.tgz) on my desktop, how would I go about installing it?
2005-09-29T08:10:00.000Z	IceDragon		In the archive is a usr folder
2005-09-29T08:10:00.000Z	IceDragon		and folders pretaining to my root usr folder etc...
2005-09-29T08:10:00.000Z	IceDragon		ok
2005-09-29T08:11:00.000Z	IceDragon		TAR command not found
2005-09-29T08:12:00.000Z	IceDragon		hmmk
2005-09-29T08:12:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	IceDragon	what was the question
2005-09-29T08:13:00.000Z	IceDragon	nomasteryoda	I have a cedega tar archive that I would like to install
2005-09-29T08:13:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	IceDragon	well, since it it is a tar, you would extract to your folder
2005-09-29T08:14:00.000Z	IceDragon	nomasteryoda	I know, I can extract it, but I cant get access privelages to install it
2005-09-29T08:14:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	IceDragon	that is using sudo
2005-09-29T08:14:00.000Z	IceDragon	nomasteryoda	I am already logged in as root
2005-09-29T08:14:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	IceDragon	well then you are at the right level
2005-09-29T08:15:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	IceDragon	is there a configure file there?
2005-09-29T08:16:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	IceDragon	did you change your hostname in the network-admin tool?
2005-09-29T08:16:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	IceDragon	use "sudo"
2005-09-29T08:17:00.000Z	IceDragon	nomasteryoda	it said I'm not in the sudeors file
2005-09-29T08:18:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	IceDragon	your account was fouled?... how?
2005-09-29T08:19:00.000Z	IceDragon	nomasteryoda	I think I changed my root folder
2005-09-29T08:19:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	IceDragon	that is getting overly complicated.... ubuntu made it simple for you...
2005-09-29T08:21:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	IceDragon	there is a way to set the sudoers list
