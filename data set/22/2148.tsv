2009-11-24T21:13:00.000Z	kubanc		hey, is it normaly that i have lots of processes with same name, like i have 2 xchat processes and 2 trackerd processes, etc ...
2009-11-24T21:13:00.000Z	frostburn	kubanc	only if you have multiple users logged in
2009-11-24T21:14:00.000Z	kubanc	frostburn	no, i'm the oinly one log into the computer
2009-11-24T21:14:00.000Z	frostburn	kubanc	do a ps -ef|grep xchat     see when one was started, and kill them if you want
2009-11-24T21:14:00.000Z	kubanc	frostburn	is it possible that i have logged in 2x with the same user name
2009-11-24T21:15:00.000Z	frostburn	kubanc	might be, don't think so though, you can also do a pstree to see if it's using a different session
2009-11-24T21:17:00.000Z	kubanc	frostburn	 if i try who command, i have 4 it gives my 4x times username, with the same name but the second column goes like this. tty1, tty7, pts/0, pts/1
2009-11-24T21:18:00.000Z	frostburn	kubanc	you can hit ctrl alt f1 to log into tty1 and ctrl alt f7 to log back
2009-11-24T21:20:00.000Z	kubanc	frostburn	 hm, is it possibly that i loged 4 times with kubanc, because i always do ctrl+alt+backspace to restart x-server,  to clean the swap memory and then log again with the same username
2009-11-24T21:21:00.000Z	frostburn	kubanc	it's possible to run multiple x servers at the same time, go through all your terminals and close them out if there are
2009-11-24T21:22:00.000Z	kubanc	frostburn	i only have one teminal opened, and that is terminator. the x servers are ok. tty1 is for terminal widnow, and the tty7 is the x-server window
2009-11-24T21:23:00.000Z	kubanc	frostburn	but what is pts/0 and pts/1
2009-11-24T21:24:00.000Z	frostburn	kubanc	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_terminal
2009-11-24T21:29:00.000Z	kubanc	frostburn	i opened the link you gave my and now i have 13 processes with name homt/username/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_terminal
2009-11-24T21:29:00.000Z	frostburn	kubanc	can you pastebin a ps -ef
2009-11-24T21:29:00.000Z	kubanc	frostburn	sory the name is  homteusername/"path to firefox-bin application"/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_terminal
2009-11-24T21:30:00.000Z	kubanc	frostburn	http://paste.ubuntu.com/326958/
2009-11-24T21:33:00.000Z	frostburn	kubanc	everything looks fine except for the copy fo firefox that's opening everything in a new instance
2009-11-24T21:34:00.000Z	kubanc	frostburn	could it be something with that: i installed firefox, and it works ok, but something went wrong ...
2009-11-24T21:35:00.000Z	frostburn	kubanc	any reason to not use the one from the repos?
2009-11-24T21:36:00.000Z	kubanc	frostburn	i'm using ubuntu 8.04, that came with firefox 3.0, so i tried to install firefox 3.5 by extracting the folder and then running the ./firefox file
2009-11-24T21:36:00.000Z	kubanc	frostburn	maybe this is the problem
