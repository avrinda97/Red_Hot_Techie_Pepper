2009-03-20T23:28:00.000Z	paul68		Hi how can I find out what driver I am using for my video card  this is the card I am using ATI Technologies Inc RV670PRO [Radeon HD 3850]
2009-03-20T23:28:00.000Z	binarymutant	paul68	lsmod will show it
2009-03-20T23:34:00.000Z	paul68	binarymutant	correct
2009-03-20T23:31:00.000Z	paul68	binarymutant	this is my output http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/134364/
2009-03-20T23:33:00.000Z	binarymutant	paul68	maybe just looking in /etc/X11/xorg.conf would be easier, I'm not seeing it in your lsmod
2009-03-20T23:33:00.000Z	binarymutant	paul68	it
2009-03-20T23:34:00.000Z	binarymutant	paul68	it's fglrx ati
2009-03-20T23:34:00.000Z	paul68	binarymutant	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/134367/
2009-03-20T23:36:00.000Z	paul68	binarymutant	is there a way that I can grep the temperature and the driver version screen resolution and Hz?
2009-03-20T23:40:00.000Z	paul68	binarymutant	any thoughts?
2009-03-20T23:41:00.000Z	binarymutant	paul68	not sure about grepping all of that
2009-03-20T23:41:00.000Z	paul68	binarymutant	if I could at least grep the temperature it would be nice
2009-03-20T23:42:00.000Z	binarymutant	paul68	cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/ATF0/temperature
2009-03-20T23:43:00.000Z	paul68	binarymutant	no such file or direcory
2009-03-20T23:44:00.000Z	paul68	binarymutant	directory exists but is empty
2009-03-20T23:46:00.000Z	binarymutant	paul68	not sure, you need sensors in there first off to get the temp or else it's just going to be a bad guess
2009-03-20T23:46:00.000Z	paul68	binarymutant	have lm sensors installed
2009-03-20T23:46:00.000Z	binarymutant	paul68	but there are programs that can monitor temps like gkrellm
2009-03-20T23:48:00.000Z	paul68	binarymutant	I understand I was asking this since I want to use it in a conky and can't find a way to visualise it :-(
2009-03-20T23:49:00.000Z	binarymutant	paul68	try ${execi 90 sensors | grep "CPU Temp:" | cut -c12-16 ;}C in your conky conf
2009-03-20T23:51:00.000Z	paul68	binarymutant	but that would give me the temperature of my normal cpu but not the temp of my video card cpu right
2009-03-20T23:58:00.000Z	paul68	binarymutant	you still there?
