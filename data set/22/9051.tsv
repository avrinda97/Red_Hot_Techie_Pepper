2005-03-24T16:52:00.000Z	SidDithersL		ok can someone here help me with wpa_supplicant?
2005-03-24T16:52:00.000Z	SidDithersL		I cant get it to accept my WPA-PSK
2005-03-24T16:52:00.000Z	SidDithersL		and I need this laptop for school tomorrow :/
2005-03-24T16:53:00.000Z	FR500	SidDithersL	 fixed the Rs problems?
2005-03-24T16:53:00.000Z	FR500		*Rx
2005-03-24T16:54:00.000Z	SidDithersL		well, sort of
2005-03-24T16:54:00.000Z	SidDithersL		I got the connection to work without encryption
2005-03-24T16:54:00.000Z	SidDithersL		but I need it to work with WPA-PSK, and I got wpa_supplicant for that
2005-03-24T16:54:00.000Z	FR500	SidDithersL	 yes, i remember, but i know u had Rx errors
2005-03-24T16:54:00.000Z	SidDithersL		wpa_supplicant finds the SSID, but it wont take my PSK
2005-03-24T16:54:00.000Z	FR500		if that is not fixed nothing will work
2005-03-24T16:54:00.000Z	SidDithersL		oh yeah, they went away. I dont know what happened
2005-03-24T16:54:00.000Z	SidDithersL		it just started working
2005-03-24T16:54:00.000Z	FR500		ok
2005-03-24T16:55:00.000Z	FR500		i dont have an AP or anything that uses wpa so i cant really help
2005-03-24T16:55:00.000Z	SidDithersL		:/
2005-03-24T16:55:00.000Z	FR500		dont know what wpa is now that i think about it
2005-03-24T16:56:00.000Z	FR500		hmmm my ap supports WPA after all
2005-03-24T16:57:00.000Z	FR500		but i'm affraid my pda wont be able to connect if i use it
2005-03-24T16:58:00.000Z	SidDithersL	FR500	could you temporarily enable it?
2005-03-24T16:58:00.000Z	SidDithersL		just to see how you get it setup so I can copy it
