2008-10-28T18:32:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	jarussi	are you able to install ubuntu?
2008-10-28T18:32:00.000Z	jarussi	danbh_intrepid	i can install ... but i can finish after the reboot thing, it reads my documents only, no os files
2008-10-28T18:33:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	jarussi	didnt you overwrite your os files?
2008-10-28T18:34:00.000Z	jarussi	danbh_intrepid	no ... i formated the old c: that had windows ... now i dont have any OS and the documents partition is now my main partition and i can't change that!
2008-10-28T18:35:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	jarussi	I think you should install ubuntu before you worry about which partition is the main one.  (I don't really know what it is for a partition to be the "main" one anyway)
2008-10-28T18:37:00.000Z	jarussi	danbh_intrepid	ok ... i'll reinstall ubuntu ..
2008-10-28T18:37:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	jarussi	wait, why are you REinstalling?
2008-10-28T18:39:00.000Z	jarussi	danbh_intrepid	because i alredy installed ubuntu, and when the computer restarts, it dont enter on te partition i've installed it ... it goes on my documents partition ...
2008-10-28T18:39:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	jarussi	whats the problem then?
2008-10-28T18:40:00.000Z	jarussi	danbh_intrepid	i cant enter the os... it keeps booting on my documents partition, and it can find no os, so it doesn't boot
2008-10-28T18:41:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	jarussi	whats the exact error messages you recieve?
2008-10-28T18:43:00.000Z	jarussi	danbh_intrepid	when i boot the pc, if the ubuntu isn't in the drive, it gets the boot disk system error ou boot failure, something like that
2008-10-28T18:43:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	jarussi	yeah, I dunno.  Maybe you need to reinstall ubuntu
2008-10-28T18:44:00.000Z	jarussi	danbh_intrepid	ok .. i'll do that ... any advise for the partition things?
2008-10-28T18:45:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	jarussi	its very hard, because I can't really tell whats going on.  From what OS are you using IRC now?
2008-10-28T18:45:00.000Z	jarussi	danbh_intrepid	i`m on another computer ... on my notebook .. i can't do anything with the other computer
2008-10-28T18:46:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	jarussi	are you using the livecd when you try to install?
2008-10-28T18:47:00.000Z	jarussi	danbh_intrepid	sorry , but i dont know .. the livecd is the one u can test ubuntu without installing it?
2008-10-28T18:48:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	jarussi	yeah

2008-10-28T18:48:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	jarussi	well, just start it up then, and ask for help here.  People should be able to give commands that will show whats up with your computer, and help with the partition stuff
