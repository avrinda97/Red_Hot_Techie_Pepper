2009-02-20T05:58:00.000Z	slestak		with rhythmbox and my sons mp3 player, I cannot remove tracks.  It is a regular usb mass storage device player, not mtp.  The Remove and Move to Trash selections are ghosted out on the context menu for single tracks I want to remove
2009-02-20T05:58:00.000Z	slestak		i tried googling, but saw nothing pertinant
2009-02-20T05:59:00.000Z	mrwes	slestak	it's mounted as a usb drive?
2009-02-20T05:59:00.000Z	mrwes	slestak	check the ownership of the mount point :)
2009-02-20T06:02:00.000Z	slestak	mrwes	its mounted by udev to /dev/media, and is uid has 700 permissions on the mountpoint
2009-02-20T06:02:00.000Z	mrwes	slestak	so you the user do not have read/write rights to it
2009-02-20T06:03:00.000Z	mrwes	slestak	sudo chmod 770 to the mount point directory
2009-02-20T06:03:00.000Z	slestak	mrwes	im logged in as him right now.  he's 10, so he doesnt have sudo or anything.  he has it mounted, and he remove tracks in rhythmbox
2009-02-20T06:04:00.000Z	mrwes	slestak	you need to change the permission of the mount point to allow you to write to it
2009-02-20T06:06:00.000Z	slestak	mrwes	he is logged in, he has 700, so he can write to it, and he cannot delete tracks
2009-02-20T06:06:00.000Z	slestak	mrwes	im sure he could do it in bash, but im trying to troubleshoot rhythmbox
2009-02-20T06:06:00.000Z	mrwes	slestak	700 is read/write/exec for root only
2009-02-20T06:07:00.000Z	slestak	mrwes	heres the mountpoint: drwx------ 16 joey root 4096 1969-12-31 19:00 disk
2009-02-20T06:08:00.000Z	slestak	mrwes	the user joey looks okay there
2009-02-20T06:09:00.000Z	mrwes	slestak	Joey does NOT have permissions on that directory
2009-02-20T06:10:00.000Z	mrwes	slestak	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions
2009-02-20T06:12:00.000Z	slestak	mrwes	700 says owner has rwx, group and world has none.
2009-02-20T06:12:00.000Z	slestak	mrwes	the mountpoint i pasted says joey owns it
2009-02-20T06:12:00.000Z	mrwes	slestak	from the terminal type chmod joey;joey /media/disk -- if that's the mount point
2009-02-20T06:21:00.000Z	slestak	mrwes	do you mean chown joey:joey?  joey is already the owner, root is the group owner.
2009-02-20T06:26:00.000Z	slestak	mrwes	with no changes to mountpoint, the user joey can delete files individually in bash.
2009-02-20T06:31:00.000Z	slestak	mrwes	i found this nugget in the rhythmbox docs"At this time, Rhythmbox can only read information but cannot write (like tags modification, tracks deletion or copy track from Rhythmbox Music Player to your player)."
