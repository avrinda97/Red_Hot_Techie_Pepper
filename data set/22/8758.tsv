2012-06-09T04:43:00.000Z	WFPKHC		is there a way i can download a live version of ubuntu if so where?
2012-06-09T04:43:00.000Z	WFPKHC		yes i was tehre and it only gives me desktop or server
2012-06-09T04:44:00.000Z	WFPKHC		well i would like to install the OS and install what packages i want - not what someone else thinks i want =D
2012-06-09T04:45:00.000Z	WFPKHC		why debian?
2012-06-09T04:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	you could start with the server version and go up from there, I guess
2012-06-09T04:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	not a lot. No X, no DE, etc.
2012-06-09T04:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	if you're new to Linux, install the ordinary desktop version and play with that for a while
2012-06-09T04:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	nope.
2012-06-09T04:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	Ubuntu is a Debian derivative, so apt instead of yum.
2012-06-09T04:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	if you mean Gnome Shell, there's a gnome-shell package you can install
2012-06-09T04:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	Unity is based on Gnome 3, jus twith Unity instead of Gnome Shell
2012-06-09T04:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	install the regular desktop version of Ubuntu for now, you can try out Gnome Shell and such from there, and you can always nuke it in favour of a server install and roll your own desktop at some point
2012-06-09T04:56:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	you can run a server off a desktop Ubuntu, I did for development for a few years. Works just fine. A basic LAMP install is dead simple.
2012-06-09T04:58:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	that should be doable. The core of the desktop version of Ubuntu is identical to the core of server, the same commands will work on either version.
2012-06-09T05:04:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	link to pendrivelinux? I know you can put Ubuntu on a USB drive, but the only way I've ever done that myself is thru the utility that comes pre-installed in desktop Ubuntu
2012-06-09T05:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	those instructions look straightforward enough; I haven't used Windows at home in about six years, so wasn't aware of the pendrivelinux app
2012-06-09T05:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	I see Ubuntu Server versions in that screenshot on the Ubuntu website, so it looks like that pendrivelinux app can create server installers. Just download the ISO you want and point the pendrive app at it.
2012-06-09T05:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	yes
2012-06-09T05:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	yes, you can SSH in and control it just like you were sitting in front of it
2012-06-09T08:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	you can't modify that doc because the system owns it, you don't
2012-06-09T08:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	wrong. :)
2012-06-09T08:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	WFPKHC	better "gksudo gedit /usr/share/nginx/www/index.html"
