2009-06-04T21:59:00.000Z	Desen		hi kids. i`m currently running Ubuntu 8.10 with GNOME 2.24. I have downloaded the .iso file for GNOME 2.26 - is it possible to install it by burning the .iso onto a CD ?
2009-06-04T22:00:00.000Z	lithax	Desen	do you mean you downloaded a GNOME ISO from the GNOME site?
2009-06-04T22:01:00.000Z	Desen	lithax	yes
2009-06-04T22:01:00.000Z	lithax	Desen	that'll be a love CD, and no you can't install it into Ubuntu
2009-06-04T22:01:00.000Z	lithax	Desen	If you want GNOME 2.26 you'll need to upgrade your version of Ubuntu
2009-06-04T22:01:00.000Z	lithax	Desen	I meant live CD! lol
2009-06-04T22:02:00.000Z	Desen	lithax	what if i will download the source and compile it on my desktop ?
2009-06-04T22:02:00.000Z	lithax	Desen	you could, but GNOME is an absolute bitch to compile
2009-06-04T22:02:00.000Z	lithax	Desen	I wouldn't recommend it unless you'r einto masochism
2009-06-04T22:03:00.000Z	Desen		hehehehe
2009-06-04T22:03:00.000Z	Desen	lithax	jrib any advice on choosing another interface other than Gnome, KDE or XFCE. i have tried all but i couldnt find a suitable one from these 3
2009-06-04T22:03:00.000Z	lithax	Desen	TWM!
2009-06-04T22:04:00.000Z	lithax	Desen	OK, I;m kidding
2009-06-04T22:05:00.000Z	Desen	lithax	jrib --- TWM = Tom's_Window_Manager ?
2009-06-04T22:06:00.000Z	lithax	Desen	yes
2009-06-04T22:06:00.000Z	lithax	Desen	It's the only WM a true geek should ever need
2009-06-04T22:07:00.000Z	Desen	lithax	jrib ---> XFCE is TOO simple, KDE too complicated and i simply do not like GNOME :P. Will try TWM. Any other i should know about ?
2009-06-04T22:07:00.000Z	lithax	Desen	If XFCE is too simple, then GNOME and KDE are your only choices really
2009-06-04T22:08:00.000Z	lithax	Desen	Perhaps try Enlightenment e17 or LXDE/OpenBox (but that's simpler than Xfce)
