2005-12-30T07:36:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	SevenIsPrime	the infrastructure of kubuntu, xubuntu and ubuntu are the same. they are based on debian "source" not debian binaries
2005-12-30T07:36:00.000Z	SevenIsPrime	johndarkhorse	Thanks for the info :
2005-12-30T07:37:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	SevenIsPrime	any additional users will not have sudo ability
2005-12-30T07:37:00.000Z	SevenIsPrime	johndarkhorse	So if I call the first user "root" all is well?
2005-12-30T07:38:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	SevenIsPrime	i wouldn't
2005-12-30T07:38:00.000Z	SevenIsPrime	johndarkhorse	I just want root to be root. Nobody else.
2005-12-30T07:38:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	SevenIsPrime	use a user name that is not "root" cuz *buntu doesnt work well with 'root' as a username
2005-12-30T07:38:00.000Z	SevenIsPrime	johndarkhorse	Sounds like apples approach ...
2005-12-30T07:39:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	SevenIsPrime	and it works fine.
2005-12-30T07:39:00.000Z	SevenIsPrime	johndarkhorse	So I have to keep in mind not to work as "root" or my first user, instead of just root. Strange concept.
2005-12-30T07:40:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	SevenIsPrime	i'm not privy to the start of your line of chat, what is the matter with your prime user?
2005-12-30T07:40:00.000Z	SevenIsPrime	johndarkhorse	Hmm ... I just don't see any reason for not calling it "root"
2005-12-30T07:41:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	SevenIsPrime	sudo gives you the same powers as a root account
2005-12-30T07:42:00.000Z	SevenIsPrime	johndarkhorse	I know and I think it opens a can of worms security wise to give that sudo power to the user.
2005-12-30T07:42:00.000Z	SevenIsPrime	johndarkhorse	All I am wondering is why you need to have that "sudo" power as a user. Be you "first" user or anybody else that is non-root.
2005-12-30T07:47:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	SevenIsPrime	kubuntu and ubuntu are the same thing, they both use sudo, or kdesu or gksudo
2005-12-30T07:48:00.000Z	SevenIsPrime	johndarkhorse	yeah. I have read the "history" of Kubuntu and edubuntu and Ubuntu. I still don't see the use for a root user that is not root. If you want to be root, become root. If you want to have regular users, pick your account.
2005-12-30T07:49:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	SevenIsPrime	if you want to be root, do it. the ubuntu dev team thought long and hard to come up with the 'sudo' model and it works fine
2005-12-30T07:49:00.000Z	SevenIsPrime	johndarkhorse	The next thing they are gonna introduce then is "automatic installation of everything with full root privileges via email", so Linux finally can have all the worms, viruses and spyware Windows users enjoy so much.
2005-12-30T07:54:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	SevenIsPrime	and that is the reason that "sudo" exists
2005-12-30T07:54:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	SevenIsPrime	join #ubuntu-offtopic please to continue this thread
2005-12-30T07:54:00.000Z	SevenIsPrime	johndarkhorse	Ok, so how does it work then. User "bla" (first user on Kubuntu) wants to launch "aptitude". What happens?
