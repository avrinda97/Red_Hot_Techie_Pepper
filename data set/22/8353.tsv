2005-10-30T13:51:00.000Z	cool_guy		here it is
2005-10-30T13:51:00.000Z	aftertaf	cool_guy	 and have you tried alternatives to realplayer?
2005-10-30T13:53:00.000Z	aftertaf	cool_guy	 use xine then
2005-10-30T13:54:00.000Z	aftertaf	cool_guy	 read the link ubotu sent you
2005-10-30T13:54:00.000Z	aftertaf	cool_guy	 read the link ubotu sent you
2005-10-30T14:05:00.000Z	aftertaf	cool_guy	 do you even reply when people ask you questions?
2005-10-30T14:07:00.000Z	aftertaf	cool_guy	 just about anything is in there.... discovering is part of the fun too.
2005-10-30T14:11:00.000Z	aftertaf	cool_guy	 hal.dll isnt on the mbr, so lilo wont have killed it.... i dont think. i dual XP/ubuntu no pbs
2005-10-30T14:11:00.000Z	aftertaf	cool_guy	 sounds like a repair from xp cd is needed, but doont touch the mbr.
2005-10-30T14:13:00.000Z	aftertaf	cool_guy	 fixmbr will kill grub. boot to 2K and edit its bootloader to add XP.
2005-10-30T14:14:00.000Z	aftertaf	cool_guy	 worth trying.... and google around for hal.dll
2005-10-30T14:23:00.000Z	aftertaf	cool_guy	 this is further than ubuntu help..... you need to learn some stuff about your pc as well dude...
2005-10-30T14:24:00.000Z	aftertaf	cool_guy	 it might be a good idea to sart afresh. why dualboot with xp & 2000 anyway?
