2009-05-03T17:52:00.000Z	lem_		hey
2009-05-03T17:52:00.000Z	lem_		anyone here tried vmware or parallels to use ubuntu in a vm? what was your host system?
2009-05-03T17:53:00.000Z	thirsteh	lem_	VMWare on Windows, Ubuntu and Gentoo. The only real problem with Ubuntu (and other newer distros) in VMWare is compiling VMWare Tools. It's pretty like to fail
2009-05-03T17:54:00.000Z	thirsteh	lem_	'likely', even. If it does for you, this should help: http://patrickmylund.com/blog/how-to-install-vmware-tools-on-ubuntu-server-810/
2009-05-03T17:54:00.000Z	lem_	thirsteh	that means, that data transfer between host and guest system would fail?
2009-05-03T17:55:00.000Z	thirsteh	lem_	the shared folders wouldn't work, no, but the system would be stable (albeit slow). You should be able to install Open VM Tools, though
2009-05-03T17:57:00.000Z	lem_	thirsteh	I was thinking of using a vm for ubuntu on my mac os 10.5. are vm's really slow?
2009-05-03T17:57:00.000Z	thirsteh	lem_	my disk i/o with hdparm -t went from 5-10mb/s without vmware tools, to 100-130mb/s with it. Pretty noticeable increase in performance :-)
2009-05-03T17:57:00.000Z	lem_	thirsteh	so you managed to get the vmware tools installed
2009-05-03T17:57:00.000Z	thirsteh	lem_	no, VMs on todays machines are fast, but installing tools on VMWare is a must, or it will be slow
2009-05-03T17:57:00.000Z	thirsteh	lem_	yep
2009-05-03T17:58:00.000Z	lem_	thirsteh	do you use it on a regular basis?
2009-05-03T18:01:00.000Z	thirsteh	lem_	yep, I have a ton of different VMs at work. One for each product configuration (we make many products, but only one or two can be installed on one machine at any one time, hence the VMs
2009-05-03T18:02:00.000Z	lem_	thirsteh	so in which way is it slower without the vmware tools? because of the more complicated procedures in case you want to copy files from on os to the other?
2009-05-03T18:04:00.000Z	thirsteh	lem_	it's slower because Ubuntu doesn't 'know' that it's a virtual guest before you install VMWare Tools. When you install it, you effectively install new 'drivers' for the virtual harddrive, ethernet adapter, mouse and keyboard
2009-05-03T18:05:00.000Z	lem_	thirsteh	I see, hmm, hopefully I can manage to install the vmware tools on my mac os
2009-05-03T18:06:00.000Z	thirsteh	lem_	if you can't, check out the article I linked. It's worked on all of my newer Ubuntu guests
2009-05-03T18:07:00.000Z	lem_	thirsteh	thanks, I will use your link. did you install 9.04 by now? the link's description is for 8.10.
2009-05-03T18:08:00.000Z	thirsteh	lem_	yes, it (almost) worked on 9.04 as well. It still couldn't compile the HGFS driver (vmware's 'shared folders'), but I don't need that
2009-05-03T18:10:00.000Z	lem_	thirsteh	ok, you helped me to look forward to my vmware use a lot more leisure. I had my fears it wouldn't work out properly, but I guess it will work just fine now.
2009-05-03T18:11:00.000Z	lem_	thirsteh	thanks
2009-05-03T18:11:00.000Z	thirsteh	lem_	:-) no problem
