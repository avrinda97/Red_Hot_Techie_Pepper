2008-09-20T13:55:00.000Z	P041NX		Please, I would appreciate if anyone can direct me in the right direction.
2008-09-20T13:56:00.000Z	P041NX		where is the place to discuss problems on usbfs
2008-09-20T13:57:00.000Z	Gnea	P041NX	force the export?
2008-09-20T13:57:00.000Z	P041NX	Gnea	Yes, usbfs exports the list of attached usb devices
2008-09-20T13:57:00.000Z	P041NX	Gnea	But for some unknown reason, suddenly it stoped showing the list
2008-09-20T13:58:00.000Z	Gnea	P041NX	what changed?
2008-09-20T13:59:00.000Z	P041NX	Gnea	Changed thing is that i've attached a usb scanner, Epson GT7600
2008-09-20T14:00:00.000Z	Gnea	P041NX	why turn acpi off?
2008-09-20T14:01:00.000Z	P041NX	Gnea	My system seems to become unstable when it's on
2008-09-20T14:01:00.000Z	Gnea	P041NX	did you try anything else or just that?
2008-09-20T14:02:00.000Z	P041NX	Gnea	Problem occoured after attaching the scanner, everything lese is my default setup that has not changesd
2008-09-20T14:04:00.000Z	P041NX	Gnea	Export if usbfs was there, showing all devices in the form if /proc/bus/usb/001/00X etc..
2008-09-20T14:04:00.000Z	Gnea	P041NX	okay, you're just repeating what you told me, you're not answering my question, which means that I can't help you.
2008-09-20T14:05:00.000Z	Gnea	P041NX	is the scanner the only device that's triggering the lack of output from the lsusb command?
2008-09-20T14:05:00.000Z	Gnea	P041NX	okay - but now i'm asking you about the scanner.
2008-09-20T14:06:00.000Z	Gnea	P041NX	how sure are you that acpi is the problem?
2008-09-20T14:09:00.000Z	Gnea	P041NX	is this a laptop or desktop?
2008-09-20T14:12:00.000Z	Gnea	P041NX	is the scanner plugged directly into the system or into a usb hub?
2008-09-20T14:20:00.000Z	Gnea	P041NX	you could try pci=routeirq
2008-09-20T14:21:00.000Z	P041NX	Gnea	 for interrupt crash?
2008-09-20T14:22:00.000Z	Gnea	P041NX	it doesn't crash, it re-arranges and handles them better - could be the reason why ACPI wasn't working right in the first place.
2008-09-20T14:24:00.000Z	P041NX	Gnea	Ok, will try and reboot it with pci=routeirq. Bi the way, you wouldn't know how to force the speed of usb to 1.1, would you?
