2005-10-30T06:25:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	what kind of game is this?
2005-10-30T06:26:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	it does not sound linux based
2005-10-30T06:26:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	is this a windows game?
2005-10-30T06:26:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	well you can use apt-get for those
2005-10-30T06:26:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	which game is this?
2005-10-30T06:27:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	hmm snowball isn't supported by apt
2005-10-30T06:27:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	so you are looking to compile this game?
2005-10-30T06:27:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	compiling is very complicated...
2005-10-30T06:28:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	to install it you need to configure it, compile it, then install it
2005-10-30T06:28:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	which can be a hard and dangerous thing
2005-10-30T06:28:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	if you do not know what you are doing
2005-10-30T06:29:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	i suggest you find a game supported with apt
2005-10-30T06:29:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	if it is supported by apt, why don't you apt-get install <package>
2005-10-30T06:30:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	apt-cache search
2005-10-30T06:30:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	apt-cache search <keyword>
2005-10-30T06:30:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	i already searched
2005-10-30T06:30:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	try apt-cache search game |less
2005-10-30T06:30:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	look for a supported game
2005-10-30T06:31:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	wesnoth is one of my favourites
2005-10-30T06:32:00.000Z	erisco	jonny	did you add all the repositories?
