2005-12-15T06:34:00.000Z	bnD	navarone	it shows this one
2005-12-15T06:35:00.000Z	navarone	bnD	 are you on windows or ubuntu now?
2005-12-15T06:37:00.000Z	navarone	bnD	were there any tcp connections? Should be showing connection on irc anyway. And if you can connect on irc you should be able to connect web
2005-12-15T06:37:00.000Z	bnD	navarone	i know, thats what i dont understand, it says connection refused whenever i attempt to access anything on port 80
2005-12-15T06:38:00.000Z	navarone	bnD	 are you on standalone system or running servers of any kind?
2005-12-15T06:39:00.000Z	navarone	bnD	does it refuse simple web browser?
2005-12-15T06:40:00.000Z	bnD	navarone	it refuses any client to port 80
2005-12-15T06:42:00.000Z	navarone	bnD	what other tinkering have you done recently?
2005-12-15T06:44:00.000Z	bnD	navarone	i was running dansguardian with tinyproxy, however theyve both been removed
2005-12-15T06:45:00.000Z	navarone	bnD	go to synaptic and remove any config files...ie do complete removal of packages. Perhaps config files are still active or interfering somehow?
2005-12-15T06:46:00.000Z	bnD	navarone	i used apt-get remove, but ill go check, brb
2005-12-15T06:46:00.000Z	navarone	bnD	search for the two packages you removed and see if they still have residual configs present
2005-12-15T06:46:00.000Z	bnD	navarone	in synaptic?
2005-12-15T06:46:00.000Z	bnD	navarone	k one sec
2005-12-15T06:47:00.000Z	navarone	bnD	just a guess here understand...:)
2005-12-15T06:47:00.000Z	bnD	navarone	couldnt hurt ;)
2005-12-15T06:48:00.000Z	bnD	navarone	got rid of config, still the same issue ;)
2005-12-15T06:49:00.000Z	navarone	bnD	also...you amy want to reinstall iptables...you may be getting multiple requests to your port 80 now and it may simply be refusing any more requests...<shrug> At any rate I think a basic firewall would be a benefit. I don't know how ubuntu reacts without one
2005-12-15T06:49:00.000Z	bnD	navarone	ive reinstalled iptables ;)
2005-12-15T06:50:00.000Z	bnD	navarone	ya, last option :)
2006-01-24T06:26:00.000Z	bnD	navarone	nothing
