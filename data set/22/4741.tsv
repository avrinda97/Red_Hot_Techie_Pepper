2008-07-13T10:54:00.000Z	maco	matelot	if they exist, they're in your home dir, where they belong
2008-07-13T10:54:00.000Z	maco	matelot	are you making sure hidden files are shown?
2008-07-13T10:55:00.000Z	maco	matelot	then they don't exist
2008-07-13T10:55:00.000Z	matelot	maco	I do ls -aFl
2008-07-13T10:55:00.000Z	matelot	maco	can I create them ?

2008-07-13T10:55:00.000Z	maco	matelot	if you need them...
2008-07-13T10:55:00.000Z	maco	matelot	i dont have those files either
2008-07-13T10:55:00.000Z	maco	matelot	they're not necessary
2008-07-13T10:56:00.000Z	matelot	maco	, you know about "devilspie" ?
2008-07-13T10:56:00.000Z	maco	matelot	never did get that thing to work...
2008-07-13T10:56:00.000Z	maco	matelot	but yes, i know of it
2008-07-13T10:56:00.000Z	matelot	maco	oh
2008-07-13T10:56:00.000Z	maco	matelot	if you need them for something, go ahead and make them, but overall those files aren't a necessity
