2009-05-23T08:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	 you mean compiz-fusion?
2010-01-10T14:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	 you could mount the share somewhere. then link the mountpoint.
2010-01-10T14:54:00.000Z	Fudge	Dr_Willis	can priv?
2010-07-17T05:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	 why do you need that?
2010-07-17T06:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	Ok. :) theres a lot of times that people want to use the gnome shared desktop feature.. and dont realize that theres ways to vnc without being logged in automacilly.
2010-07-17T06:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	 I cant say that ive noticed  X not starting with no monitor attatched..  then again. ive not really tried.
2010-07-17T06:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	 are some using VGA monitors and others DVI? perhaps>?
2010-07-17T06:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	 i use all dvi these days.
2010-07-17T06:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	 that is weird.. :)
2010-07-17T06:04:00.000Z	Fudge	Dr_Willis	 where is the xorg.conf?
2010-07-17T06:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	 /etc/X11/ IF it exists.
2010-07-17T06:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	 X auto configres for the most part these days. I iave several machines with no xorg.conf
2010-07-17T06:09:00.000Z	Fudge	Dr_Willis	 i read that if a monitor is specifed manually that xorg doesnt try and detect it
2010-07-17T06:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	 ive not had to tweak the xorg.conf in years.  but that sounds right.
2010-07-17T06:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	 actually it depends on if they are ntsc or PAL. :) but over svideo - yes. its some low res like that.
2010-07-17T06:22:00.000Z	Fudge	Dr_Willis	 i might have to plug a monitor in and ask the myth guys
2010-08-22T08:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	 Not that ive noticed.
2011-02-27T14:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	 that works :)
2011-06-08T17:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	 yes. Its a X setting some where.. i forget :)
2011-08-20T10:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Fudge	 depends on your needs I imagine theres eggdrop bots that5 can do most anything you need
2011-08-20T10:08:00.000Z	Fudge	Dr_Willis	 yeah eggy i san option
