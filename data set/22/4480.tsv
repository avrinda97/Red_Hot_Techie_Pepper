2009-12-06T18:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		you are not being clear on what you are wanting to do  either
2009-12-06T18:53:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Dr_Willis	with SSH can I still use graphic apps?
2009-12-06T18:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LetsGo67	 what doies icewm have to do with it? open up a terminal, ssh remoteipmachine
2009-12-06T18:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LetsGo67	 unless you want some other type of remote connection
2009-12-06T18:49:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Dr_Willis	I want the IceWM machine to be the server.
2009-12-06T18:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LetsGo67	 Icewm has nothing to do with being a 'server' Unless you are referiong to being a vncdesktop server. Install the services you want to serve
2009-12-06T18:50:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Dr_Willis	I tried to read the tutorials, they are confusing.
2009-12-06T18:51:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Dr_Willis	this is all new to me
2009-12-06T18:52:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Dr_Willis	The IceWM computer is the server.  I want it secured with SSH.  I want to be able to access it over the Internet using Windows.
2009-12-06T18:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LetsGo67	 if you want ssh access.. then install the sshd server/service -  then you can use putty and winscp and xming on windows to access the server
2009-12-06T18:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LetsGo67	 you can install 'xming' on the windows box and get it set where  the linux apps appear on the windows machine via ssh - yes
2009-12-06T18:55:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Dr_Willis	okay, then how do I start SSH on the IceWM box, please?
2009-12-06T18:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LetsGo67	 install the ssh service
2009-12-06T20:06:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Dr_Willis	I am still lost... :(
2010-09-11T04:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LetsGo67	 an .img of what exactly?
2010-09-11T05:01:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Dr_Willis	of Windows 98 for QEMU.  Soreau: (franco?) it becomes big or small depending on the files in it.  QCow.
2010-09-11T05:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LetsGo67	 try converting it to iso perhaps. I dont even recall what makes 'img' files..
2010-09-11T05:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LetsGo67	 or do  You mean its a hard drive IMAGE file ? not an optical disk image file?
2010-09-11T05:03:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Dr_Willis	qemu-img on the command line.
2010-09-11T05:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LetsGo67	 I thought qemu used 'raw image' files.  Not sure what other programs you want to access it with. Ive rarely used qemu.
2010-09-11T05:11:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Dr_Willis	qemu-img convert -c -f raw -O qcow2 win98.img win98q.img
2011-05-04T17:08:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Dr_Willis	Are you a PHD?
