2008-09-12T17:54:00.000Z	Hideme		My desktop just recently started logging the session out for no apparent reason while I'm working. The screen goes black, I see some text like you won't on a re-boot and then I'm back at the GUI login. Once I login again, my session was closed and appears as the user (me) was logged out. I'm using Ubuntu 8.04 default Gnome desktop, any idea why is is happening?
2008-09-12T17:54:00.000Z	maxx_	Hideme	I'm guessing video driver issues. what is your video?
2008-09-12T17:54:00.000Z	maxx_	Hideme	when the X server unexpectedly dies, it will throw you back out at the gdm login screen
2008-09-12T17:56:00.000Z	Hideme	maxx_	gdm being the graphic login you'd on any install even if the video driver were incorrect or not functioning correctly?   I have an Nvida card, think I'm using the "restricted" drivers too.
2008-09-12T17:59:00.000Z	Hideme	maxx_	  Any suggestions?
2008-09-12T17:59:00.000Z	maxx_	Hideme	can you tail /var/log/Xorg.0.log when this happens?
2008-09-12T18:00:00.000Z	Hideme	maxx_	 Not really... as it closes my session and I am forced to login again.  I can view the log after the "crash" though.
2008-09-12T18:01:00.000Z	maxx_	Hideme	that's fine.. just something to help diagnose why it's crashing
2008-09-12T18:01:00.000Z	maxx_	Hideme	also perhaps try updating your video drivers
2008-09-12T18:02:00.000Z	maxx_	Hideme	does your crash happen after any certain amount of time? on any certain operation?
2008-09-12T18:04:00.000Z	Hideme	maxx_	 Not quite sure yet. Has only happened once a day for the last 4 days. Not in a specific application, but perhaps when I'm minimizing a window (MAYBE).
2008-09-12T18:05:00.000Z	maxx_	Hideme	sudo apt-get install envyng-gtk to get some new nvidia drivers
2008-09-12T18:06:00.000Z	maxx_	Hideme	(and then run apps -> system tools -> envyng)
2008-09-12T18:06:00.000Z	Hideme	maxx_	 ok
2008-09-12T18:11:00.000Z	Hideme	maxx_	brb reboot
2008-09-12T18:30:00.000Z	Hideme	maxx_	EnvyNG installed.  Guess we'll see how it goes.
2008-09-12T18:31:00.000Z	maxx_	Hideme	have you actually run EnvyNG yet? it grabs the drivers for you when you run it. if you haven't run it yet you don't have new drivers.
2008-09-12T18:32:00.000Z	maxx_	Hideme	applications -> system tools -> envyng .. run it.
2008-09-12T18:32:00.000Z	Hideme	maxx_	 yes...  Apps > system > EnvyNG
2008-09-12T18:32:00.000Z	maxx_	Hideme	so it installed the drivers and rebooted you?
2008-09-12T18:32:00.000Z	Hideme	maxx_	yes
2008-09-12T18:36:00.000Z	Hideme	maxx_	So that's it..... sit and wait for it to happen again?
