2010-03-30T23:13:00.000Z	acicula	Ahren_The_Magus	tell ZSNESS to use pulseaudio
2010-03-30T23:13:00.000Z	acicula		and vlc for that matter, then you can mix it
2010-03-30T23:14:00.000Z	Ahren_The_Magus	acicula	Already tried that...the only way I can get ZSNES to use audio in any usable way is to default everything to SDL.
2010-03-30T23:14:00.000Z	acicula	Ahren_The_Magus	if it defaults to /dev/dsp you can use the padsp wrapper
2010-03-30T23:15:00.000Z	Ahren_The_Magus	acicula	*confused look*
2010-03-30T23:16:00.000Z	acicula	Ahren_The_Magus	actally, tried zsnes -ad pulse ?
2010-03-30T23:16:00.000Z	Ahren_The_Magus	acicula	The only option that ZSNES seems to like is zsnes -ad sdl
2010-03-30T23:17:00.000Z	acicula	Ahren_The_Magus	well maybe the padsp wrapper works, just start from the console with padsp <prog>
2010-03-30T23:17:00.000Z	Ahren_The_Magus	acicula	Trying -ad pulse right now, just to be 100% sure it won't accept it on my laptop.
2010-03-30T23:17:00.000Z	Ahren_The_Magus	acicula	-ad pulse = no audio in ZSNES.  Confirmed.
2010-03-30T23:18:00.000Z	acicula		try padsp znes -ad oss
2010-03-30T23:18:00.000Z	acicula		or the dsl switch but dunno if that hooks back to dsp
2010-03-30T23:19:00.000Z	Ahren_The_Magus	acicula	I tried 'padsp zsnes -ad sdl'.  Sound is functional.  Trying VLC now to see if that works.  If not, I'll try -ad oss instead.
2010-03-30T23:21:00.000Z	Ahren_The_Magus	acicula	VLC is muted...trying oss now.
2010-03-30T23:22:00.000Z	Ahren_The_Magus	acicula	-ad oss = ZSNES is muted.
2010-03-30T23:22:00.000Z	acicula	Ahren_The_Magus	:/ oh well, was worth a try
2010-03-30T23:23:00.000Z	acicula	Ahren_The_Magus	you did try that with vlc set to pulseaudio i assume?
2010-03-30T23:23:00.000Z	Ahren_The_Magus	acicula	Thanks for the info in any case.  I just deal with having one sound output at a time, and if I want to play a game and watch a movie simultaneously I do it from within my Windows VirtualBox.
2010-03-30T23:25:00.000Z	Ahren_The_Magus	acicula	VLC should be using Pulse, considering that's what is set as my sound device in System->Preferences->Sound, yes?
2010-03-30T23:25:00.000Z	acicula	Ahren_The_Magus	not sure if vlc pulls it defaults from there, the gnome movie player does though
2010-03-30T23:26:00.000Z	Ahren_The_Magus	acicula	I don't like gnome's media player.  VLC works much better for me.
2010-03-30T23:27:00.000Z	acicula	Ahren_The_Magus	yeah its a nice player
