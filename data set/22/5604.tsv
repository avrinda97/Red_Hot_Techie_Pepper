2007-07-12T06:40:00.000Z	vanden		hi all. I stupidly removed the nm-aplet from my tray. (7.04 w/ gnome)I cannot figure out how to get it back. Google gave no joy. ps -e show nm-applet running, but I cannot see it. Anybody able to point me in the right direction?
2007-07-12T06:41:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	vanden	right click the bar.  Click Add to panel It is under system...
2007-07-12T06:41:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	vanden	It's under system & hardware.
2007-07-12T06:42:00.000Z	vanden	nerdygirl_ellie	It isn't in the icon I can choose from, though :-(
2007-07-12T06:44:00.000Z	vanden	nerdygirl_ellie	that's Network-Monitor, which isn't as good as the one I removed by accident.
2007-07-12T06:44:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	vanden	Checking now.
2007-07-12T06:44:00.000Z	vanden	nerdygirl_ellie	thanks
2007-07-12T06:48:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	vanden	If I were me, I would open synaptic, search for network manager, right click the two network manager apps and select Mark for complete removal, which removes the config files too.  After removing them, I would reinstall and restart X.
2007-07-12T06:49:00.000Z	vanden	nerdygirl_ellie	That sound's promising. Any chance that'd bust my ability to get online, though. No fun figuring stuff out with one box that can't get otu to the world :-)
2007-07-12T06:50:00.000Z	vanden	nerdygirl_ellie	I don't know how to restart X.
2007-07-12T06:51:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	vanden	It's possible, if you are worried, mark them for reinstallation first, then completely remove them, then install them..  Then you'll be sure the .deb files will be cached locally.  (in /var/cache/apt/yadayada.)
2007-07-12T06:54:00.000Z	vanden	nerdygirl_ellie	thanks for the suggestions. I'm off to try them, and will come back when done to let you know if you are still about. (You too, Jordan_U)
2007-07-12T07:15:00.000Z	vanden	nerdygirl_ellie	I'm back :-) Uninstalling and reinstalling the network manager apps didn't help. But, happily, it didn't kill my connectivity, either :-)
2007-07-12T07:15:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	vanden	yeah for still working, booh for not fixed.
2007-07-12T07:16:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	vanden	try... alt-f2 nm-applet --sm-disable
2007-07-12T07:16:00.000Z	vanden	nerdygirl_ellie	will do. Thanks
2007-07-12T07:18:00.000Z	vanden	nerdygirl_ellie	No detectable effect. What were you hoping it would do?
2007-07-12T07:19:00.000Z	vanden	nerdygirl_ellie	reading the man page didn't shed light on why you suggested that command.
2007-07-12T07:19:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	vanden	for me it will make my icon reappear if I kill it.
2007-07-12T07:21:00.000Z	vanden	nerdygirl_ellie	is the nm-applet one of the icons availble to be added for you via add to panel? (You previously suggested add to panel, but I only have the Network Monitor under system and hardware. That one doesn't let you easily switch networks.)
2007-07-12T07:23:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	vanden	no, for me it's the one that does the wireless network and works and all.
2007-07-12T07:23:00.000Z	vanden	nerdygirl_ellie	argh. that's a bit frusterating then. Oh well, thanks for the help. I think I'll try a forum post.
