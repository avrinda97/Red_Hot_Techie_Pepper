2012-03-20T18:04:00.000Z	fabiansc		Hi again. I am on my way to patch my wireless card for using aircrack (IT Security Lecture at university). The manual says I need to decide which kernel version I am useing (3.2 or newer) or (older kerlnels)
2012-03-20T18:04:00.000Z	fabiansc		Do they mean my linux kernel (I guess it's 3.0) or a "wireless kernel" if this exists
2012-03-20T18:04:00.000Z	ikonia	fabiansc	there is no such thing as a wireless kernel
2012-03-20T18:05:00.000Z	ikonia	fabiansc	the fact that you are not comfortable with this inforamtion suggests you should not be trying to patch the kernel
2012-03-20T18:05:00.000Z	ikonia	fabiansc	I very very VERY strongly advise you not to try to patch the kernel at your current ability
2012-03-20T18:06:00.000Z	fabiansc	ikonia	thanks for the advise; but I need to based on my lecture. I guess it can only kick ubuntu down; so I need to reinstall it.
2012-03-20T18:06:00.000Z	ikonia	fabiansc	I doubt your lecture forces you to do something like this
2012-03-20T18:08:00.000Z	fabiansc	ikonia	We need to simulate an attack on a wireless lan and present the results... there is no further support... but that's my problem :-)
2012-03-20T18:08:00.000Z	ikonia	fabiansc	have you considered using a distro that is aimed to do that
2012-03-20T18:09:00.000Z	ikonia	fabiansc	with the utmost respect, how can you give a lecture on something like this when you have no understanding of how to use/manage the tool
2012-03-20T18:09:00.000Z	ikonia	fabiansc	why not a modern backtrack install
2012-03-20T18:09:00.000Z	fabiansc	ikonia	my hardware is completely not supporter. I tried it before.
2012-03-20T18:10:00.000Z	ikonia	fabiansc	backtrack is based on ubuntu
2012-03-20T18:10:00.000Z	ikonia	fabiansc	so if ubuntu works, backtrack will work
2012-03-20T18:11:00.000Z	fabiansc	ikonia	It doesn't boot at all and stuck while booting; only hard reset helps. Ubuntu boots fine. I don't know what else could be the issue. MD5 is fine.
2012-03-20T18:11:00.000Z	ikonia	fabiansc	what version of backtrack have you tried ?
2012-03-20T18:11:00.000Z	ikonia	fabiansc	ok, that is very old, try a modern version, backtrack 4 - 5
2012-03-20T18:12:00.000Z	fabiansc	ikonia	Ah that's old? Huh - than I'll take a second look for it. Thanks
2012-03-20T18:13:00.000Z	ikonia	fabiansc	I promise using a distro that is built to do what you want rather than trying to patch the ubuntu kernel, will be a lot lot easier
2012-03-20T18:14:00.000Z	fabiansc	ikonia	do you know whether i can install it like my ubuntu right now (via wubi)?
2012-03-20T18:14:00.000Z	ikonia	fabiansc	no, and you're using wubi, bad idea
2012-03-20T18:14:00.000Z	ikonia	fabiansc	if you are going to do a job - do it right, get a distro like back track, install it properly in a dual boot setup
