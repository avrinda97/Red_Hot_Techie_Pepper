2008-06-07T09:16:00.000Z	daemon3		What's the media player called in Ubuntu?  The one that isn't so popular at playing movies?  I think I accidentally uninstalled it.
2008-06-07T09:16:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	reinstall the ubuntu-desktop metapackage
2008-06-07T09:16:00.000Z	daemon3	Flannel	I did.
2008-06-07T09:16:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	then you have whatever came default
2008-06-07T09:18:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	wubi is neither
2008-06-25T00:15:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	Theres esvn, rapidsvn, svnworkbench, and a nautilus script thing (so it integrates with your file manager) called nautilus-script-collection-svn
2008-07-03T00:33:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	Whats not working?
2008-07-03T00:34:00.000Z	daemon3	Flannel	The apache server.  Every time I try to type in http://localhost, the browser just hangs.
2008-07-03T00:35:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	Alright, and apahce is running?  What do your logs say? Also, how did you put the site in a homedir, and for what purpose?  does userdir not suffice?
2008-07-03T00:36:00.000Z	daemon3	Flannel	Where are the logs?
2008-07-03T00:36:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	/var/log/apache2
2008-07-03T00:37:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	no error.log?
2008-07-03T00:38:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	alright, and `sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart` doesn't give anything out of the ordinary?
2008-07-03T00:56:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	Where do you have your DocumentRoot? and what are the permissions?
2008-07-03T00:59:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	Yeah, userdir does that.  You don't need to move your document root.
2008-07-03T00:59:00.000Z	daemon3	Flannel	I'm sorry, what do you mean?
2008-07-03T01:00:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	Theres an apache module that automatically includes /home/*/public_html for serving up
2008-07-03T01:01:00.000Z	daemon3	Flannel	Oh, that config file.  Yeah, all the sites are /home/user/public_html/
2008-08-16T01:34:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	gedit won't work without a GUI.  Use nano instead.
2008-08-16T01:36:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	And running from the command line gives you what?
2008-08-16T01:36:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	Right... use gedit on your local machine, through the command line.
2008-08-16T01:37:00.000Z	Flannel	daemon3	No, that's not what you're saying.  We're not suggesting you run gedit remotely, we're suggesting you run it locally, but through the command line, instead of clicking an icon.
