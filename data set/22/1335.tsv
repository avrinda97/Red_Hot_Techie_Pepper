2010-06-23T12:18:00.000Z	yudi1	om26er	yes
2010-06-23T12:19:00.000Z	om26er	yudi1	is there any memory card mounted ?
2010-06-23T12:19:00.000Z	yudi1	om26er	no
2010-06-23T12:20:00.000Z	om26er	yudi1	what happens when you supend?
2010-06-23T12:20:00.000Z	yudi1	om26er	I recently installed mythtv, blank screen, hangs
2010-06-23T12:21:00.000Z	yudi1	om26er	had to do a hard reboot,  it used to work,
2010-06-23T12:21:00.000Z	om26er	yudi1	try the latest kernel
2010-06-23T12:22:00.000Z	yudi1	om26er	present kernel - 2.6.32-22
2010-06-23T12:23:00.000Z	yudi1	om26er	isn't that the latest kernel
2010-06-23T12:23:00.000Z	om26er	yudi1	first enable the proposed repository and update it will update the kernel. if that does not work install the latest kernel from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.34-lucid/
2010-06-23T12:24:00.000Z	om26er	yudi1	lucid is not using the latest kernel. the latest stable version is 2.6.34
2010-06-23T12:27:00.000Z	yudi1	om26er	ok, I thought proposed updates are like beta versions, I installed a proposed version before on older version and it caused more problems. I prefer to stay away from proposed
2010-06-23T12:28:00.000Z	om26er	yudi1	proposed are the stable updates that become normal updates after proper testing. they are not beta at all.
2010-06-23T12:29:00.000Z	yudi1	om26er	 I guess if it causes problems, I can still go back to previous version.
2010-06-23T12:31:00.000Z	yudi1	om26er	I went trough Ubuntuforums n there is a long thread about this bug, seems not resolved yet, thats y I came here
2010-06-23T12:32:00.000Z	om26er	yudi1	which laptop you have?
2010-06-23T12:33:00.000Z	yudi1	om26er	it used to suspend, stopped recently
2010-06-23T12:33:00.000Z	yudi1	om26er	the oly change I can think of is mythtv
2010-06-23T12:33:00.000Z	om26er	yudi1	mythtv cant be related I think
2010-06-23T12:34:00.000Z	yudi1	om26er	will try mythtv channel
