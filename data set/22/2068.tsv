2010-10-15T11:04:00.000Z	StaRetji		folks, I've made htpc with xbmc from ubuntu maverick. I've edited sudoers not to ask for password coz I've made some bash scripts to work with my remote control (no keyboard, just remote with mouse function). Now I have problem, when I connect to my house wifi it asks for password ones, but every time it asks for KEYRING password. How can I avoid this, I mean how to prevent ubuntu for asking keyring password. THX ppl!

2010-10-15T11:06:00.000Z	StaRetji		I can't enter keyring password every time as I don't have keyboard :/
2010-10-15T11:07:00.000Z	hateball	StaRetji	go into wifi settings and for that SSID/connection, set it to be "available to all users". This requires a keyboard once tho
2010-10-15T11:08:00.000Z	StaRetji	hateball	thx for answering, but it's a atom box which I carry with me and connect to other wifi hotspots. I.e. I'm on the airport or hotel and I can't login unless is free :/
2010-10-15T11:08:00.000Z	StaRetji		is there a way to turn it off completely
2010-10-15T11:10:00.000Z	hateball	StaRetji	Ah! Well you can either use a totally passwordless keyring
2010-10-15T11:10:00.000Z	hateball	StaRetji	Or you can allow the network-manager parts to use the keyring fully trusted
2010-10-15T11:12:00.000Z	StaRetji	hateball	how can I allow network manager to use keyring fully trusted? thx for helping out so far
2010-10-15T11:13:00.000Z	StaRetji	hateball	also, is there a way to use passwordless keyring via ssh terminal. I mean, can I reset password via console?
2010-10-15T11:14:00.000Z	hateball	StaRetji	Can you xforward?
2010-10-15T11:14:00.000Z	StaRetji	hateball	I have x11vnc and ssh access to the box
2010-10-15T11:15:00.000Z	StaRetji	hateball	I can access it remotely, I'm in it rigth now, both ssh and vnc
2010-10-15T11:19:00.000Z	hateball	StaRetji	you can launch "seahorse" and then remove the entire thing. But it will prompt you next time, to create a password etc... which you can then leave blank. I'm not sure how good this will all work out having direct input to the machine tho
2010-10-15T11:21:00.000Z	StaRetji	hateball	no seahorse, but I'll install it
2010-10-15T11:23:00.000Z	hateball	StaRetji	oh you're not running standard gnome/ubuntu
2010-10-15T11:24:00.000Z	StaRetji	hateball	maverick with xfce4, minimal install and the I've installed xfc4
2010-10-15T11:25:00.000Z	hateball	StaRetji	Oh... I dont know how xfce handles keyrings at all
2010-10-15T11:25:00.000Z	StaRetji	hateball	I've installed seahorse, started it, it doesn't show anything, I mean password and encryptio keys are empty
2010-10-15T11:26:00.000Z	StaRetji	hateball	OK, I'll try to google then. It's good to know that resetting keyring password to blank will remove it. Thx once again
2010-10-15T11:26:00.000Z	hateball	StaRetji	Good luck :)
2010-10-15T11:26:00.000Z	StaRetji	hateball	thx :)
