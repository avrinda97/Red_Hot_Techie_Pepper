2004-11-05T08:50:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Gmail	Trust me on that, you just want the tcl, perl, python and ruby plugins and nothing more.  Let users deal with their own scripts
2004-11-05T08:51:00.000Z	Gmail	Hawkwind	yes there are like ignore
2004-11-05T08:51:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Gmail	There is an ignore option already by default in Xchat
2004-11-05T08:52:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Gmail	If you right click on a nick, it's there by default.  It's part of the nick menu
2004-11-05T08:52:00.000Z	Gmail	Hawkwind	no just in must build including the default your default goval scripts are kept in /usr/share/doc/xchat-common/scripts-perl
2004-11-05T08:53:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Gmail	Settings---Advanced---Userlist Popups  That is where your ignore option is kept by default and edited or removed if you want
2004-11-05T08:54:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Gmail	Not every distro is like that though
2004-11-05T08:55:00.000Z	Gmail	Hawkwind	ignore is a plug that come with xchat by defult it made by the devel team but its not built into binary form and is a perl script that is easly updatable/upgradable/editble
2004-11-05T09:02:00.000Z	Gmail	Hawkwind	xchat-text is built into xchat
2004-11-05T09:04:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Gmail	Xhat doesn't use xchat-text's source.  zed is the maintainer of xchat and the guy who used to maintain xchat-text doesn't do it anymore.  They are two seperate things now

2004-11-05T09:05:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Gmail	Right, it used to be, but not anymore.  Xchat-text is useless
2004-11-05T09:05:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Gmail	It's been 17 months since last code was put into xchat-text
2004-11-05T09:05:00.000Z	Gmail	Hawkwind	ok so no xchat-text
