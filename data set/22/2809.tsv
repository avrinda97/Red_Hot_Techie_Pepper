2009-02-27T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dykam	[ Â  29.983472] ndiswrapper (pnp_start_device:435): Windows driver couldn't initialize the device (C0000001)
2009-02-27T17:45:00.000Z	Dykam	ActionParsnip	I know it trhows such errors, but why does the driver work when pluggin it in later on
2009-02-27T17:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dykam	did you try without acpi enabled?
2009-02-27T17:45:00.000Z	Dykam	ActionParsnip	how?
2009-02-27T17:49:00.000Z	Dykam	ActionParsnip	what side effects could this switch give me?
2009-02-27T17:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dykam	no notification of battery expiration not sure of others really
2009-02-27T17:50:00.000Z	Dykam	ActionParsnip	hehe, it is a desktop, no battery stuff
2009-02-27T17:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dykam	then very very littel
2009-02-27T17:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dykam	it can make system fans go insanely fast
2009-02-27T17:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dykam	you can always remove them if its no good
2009-02-27T17:51:00.000Z	Dykam	ActionParsnip	would this fix the problem, or give other error messages
2009-02-27T17:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dykam	theres no way to know other than try
2009-02-27T17:52:00.000Z	Dykam	ActionParsnip	I mean... why do you think this could solve/be the problem, is it commonly know?
2009-02-27T17:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dykam	some system use weird power management which the kernel may not like so disabling th acpi functionality can make things work
2009-02-27T17:57:00.000Z	Dykam	ActionParsnip	coud,l the fact that standby sometimes fails in XP proof my system fails?
2009-02-27T17:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dykam	possibly, you are going to have to poke your system to see whats gong on and see what makes it work
