2006-03-26T09:34:00.000Z	comradevik		i cant make an alias to my external drive because i have a space in the path
2006-03-26T09:34:00.000Z	comradevik		, is there a way i can go around that?
2006-03-26T09:35:00.000Z	bjm	comradevik	huh? then rename it.
2006-03-26T09:35:00.000Z	bjm	comradevik	how'd you mount that external drive?
2006-03-26T09:36:00.000Z	comradevik	bjm	/dev/sda1 /media/MEDIA\040DRIVE vfat rw,nosuid,nodev,quiet,shortname=winnt,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=077,iocharset=utf8 0 0
2006-03-26T09:37:00.000Z	bjm	comradevik	you need to make a new dir in media with *no spaces*, unmount your external and mount it on that new dir
2006-03-26T10:03:00.000Z	bjm	comradevik	tweak it in /etc/fstab?
2006-03-26T10:03:00.000Z	comradevik	bjm	/dev/sda1 /media/MEDIA vfat rw,nosuid,nodev,quiet,shortname=winnt,uid=1000,gid=1 000,umask=077,iocharset=utf8 0 0
2006-03-26T10:04:00.000Z	bjm	comradevik	is the uid *your* uid or gid?
2006-03-26T10:04:00.000Z	comradevik	bjm	no idea
2006-03-26T10:05:00.000Z	bjm	comradevik	cat /etc/passwd
2006-03-26T10:06:00.000Z	comradevik	bjm	what am i looking for
2006-03-26T10:07:00.000Z	bjm	comradevik	your user's uid and gid... the one who you want to have rw access on the drive
2006-03-26T10:08:00.000Z	comradevik	bjm	the thing is i can edit the files on the drive. i just can't change permissions
2006-03-26T10:09:00.000Z	bjm	comradevik	you can edit but you still want to change perms? how so? if you can edit, and i suppose by edit you mean you can write, then why do you need to change perms for?
2006-03-26T10:09:00.000Z	comradevik	bjm	because apache gives me forbiden when i try to acces the drive through the web
2006-03-26T10:10:00.000Z	bjm	comradevik	ah... apache can't recognize users via http. you need to configure apache, not your drive.
2006-03-26T10:10:00.000Z	bjm	comradevik	you have to allow it to read from http
2006-03-26T10:11:00.000Z	bjm	comradevik	pls don't ask me how to configure apache, thanks :)
2006-03-26T10:11:00.000Z	bjm	comradevik	allow from all i guess
2006-03-26T10:11:00.000Z	bjm	comradevik	:)
2006-03-26T10:11:00.000Z	bjm	comradevik	no prob
