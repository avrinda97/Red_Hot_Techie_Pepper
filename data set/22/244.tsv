2012-04-30T14:44:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	awesome, nice find
2012-05-01T12:59:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	oh, i see
2012-05-01T13:01:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	well, ppas are generally unsupported and he has a gnome3 ppa there too, which certainly breaks stuff on 10.04
2012-05-01T13:01:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	why would he need a gnome3 ppa and a kubuntu ppa?
2012-05-01T13:08:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	no worries, i'm not as advanced as you, i use nano :)
2012-05-01T13:09:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	gedit is graphical so you use gksudo, nano and vi are commandline so you use sudo
2012-05-01T13:12:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	update manager has a settings thingy
2012-07-18T19:01:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	just so you are aware using compiz settings manager can break unity
2012-07-18T19:19:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	what?
2012-07-18T19:21:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	oh, that is more accurate and understandable
2012-07-19T19:54:00.000Z	L3top	auronandace	L3top, the response to lsb_release -sc was "precise"
2012-07-19T19:55:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	clearly he doesn't know what he's done
2012-07-19T19:56:00.000Z	L3top	auronandace	I believe they upgraded direct from maverick to precise but still need support, and havn't quite figured out how to say the right thing to get it.
2012-07-19T19:56:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	the right thing to say is: that isn't supported
2012-07-19T19:57:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	sorry if it sounds like i'm blaming you
2012-07-19T19:58:00.000Z	L3top	auronandace	I believe I am sort of blaming me. In the future I will explain that proceedure to avoid this.
2012-07-19T19:59:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	don't worry, you can't blame yourself for other people's mistakes :)
2012-07-19T20:21:00.000Z	L3top	auronandace	ok_, bekks: I believe it may be required with SOME UEFI bioses as SOME do not like to boot directly to NTFS.
2012-07-19T20:22:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	ah, i've never used efi or uefi
2012-07-20T18:16:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	+1
2012-10-19T16:35:00.000Z	auronandace	L3top	or grep -i installed
