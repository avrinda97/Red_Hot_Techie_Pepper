2010-01-07T22:21:00.000Z	Mortal_	RalphSpencer	the output you posted seems to come from a bash script
2010-01-07T22:21:00.000Z	RalphSpencer	Mortal_	yes
2010-01-07T22:34:00.000Z	RalphSpencer	Mortal_	now "The DRI drivers can not be installed without the latest kernel modules.Installation will be aborted. See the dri.log file for information on what went wrong." Rest same but this errror instead of that one
2010-01-07T22:37:00.000Z	RalphSpencer	Mortal_	you there for me?
2010-01-07T22:38:00.000Z	Mortal_	RalphSpencer	sec, I'll just need to read through the script
2010-01-07T22:38:00.000Z	RalphSpencer	Mortal_	ok sure
2010-01-07T22:39:00.000Z	Mortal_	RalphSpencer	I don't know how much shell scripting you know, but searching the script for the string 'The DRI drivers can not be installed without the latest kernel modules' will get you to line 1350
2010-01-07T22:40:00.000Z	Mortal_	RalphSpencer	I'm not sure the checks are legitimate and whether the error message is telling the truth, that some kernel module(s) is/are missing, but that could be the problem
2010-01-07T22:41:00.000Z	RalphSpencer	Mortal_	if these modules are really missing, how do I install them?
2010-01-07T22:41:00.000Z	Mortal_	RalphSpencer	I don't know which modules are missing... does it say which?
2010-01-07T22:41:00.000Z	Mortal_	RalphSpencer	then add errmsg "$DRV_MODULE" just before line 1350
2010-01-07T22:43:00.000Z	RalphSpencer	Mortal_	now it says gdg in there
