2005-07-02T09:54:00.000Z	ray_		i had to compile alsa 1.0.9 for my sound to work..... if i update the linux-headers and image will that break my sound?
2005-07-02T09:54:00.000Z	bob2	ray_	if it overwrites the .ko for your driver, yes
2005-07-02T09:55:00.000Z	ray_	bob2	can i stop that from happening
2005-07-02T09:55:00.000Z	bob2	ray_	back it up, restore it after installing the kernel image
2005-07-02T09:56:00.000Z	ray_	bob2	good idea thanks man
2005-07-02T09:57:00.000Z	bob2	ray_	presumably 150MB of that is disk cache
2005-07-02T09:58:00.000Z	ray_	bob2	yeah i have a gig of ram but ubuntu only sees it as like 850? u know whats up with that?
2005-07-02T09:58:00.000Z	bob2	ray_	install the -686 kernel
2005-07-02T09:59:00.000Z	ray_	bob2	is that easy
2005-07-02T09:59:00.000Z	ray_	bob2	is it an option at the normal install
2005-07-02T09:59:00.000Z	bob2	ray_	yes, if you have a 686 cpu
2005-07-02T09:59:00.000Z	bob2	ray_	no
2005-07-02T10:13:00.000Z	bob2	ray_	Debian (which I still do use)
2005-07-02T10:14:00.000Z	ray_	bob2	I love debian but I just got a new computer and Ubuntu works and deb doesnt :(
2005-07-02T10:14:00.000Z	bob2	ray_	yeah, X in Debian is a little outdated
2005-07-02T10:15:00.000Z	ray_	bob2	yup ..... xorg works really nice
2005-07-02T10:23:00.000Z	bob2	ray_	can scroll up then
2005-07-02T10:37:00.000Z	ray_	bob2	I would be pulling my hair out if I were you....
2005-07-22T07:38:00.000Z	bob2	ray_	try #kubuntu
2005-07-22T07:38:00.000Z	ray_	bob2	i did
