2005-04-09T11:13:00.000Z	kkathman		greetings all :)
2005-04-09T11:13:00.000Z	kkathman		can dpkg -i install a tar.gz file?
2005-04-09T11:15:00.000Z	kkathman		Here's my problem. I tried to get  the static tar.gz of the new Opera last night. It seemed to install, but it didnt install in /usr/bin/ as most apps do and it wont run except right off the install.
2005-04-09T11:15:00.000Z	kkathman		so I am thinking I am going to get the DEB Sarge version, install the libqt package and then install Opera from the standard DEB
2005-04-09T11:15:00.000Z	kkathman		any comments?
2005-04-09T11:16:00.000Z	kkathman		djp...warty's version of FF is stuck at 0.93
2005-04-09T11:16:00.000Z	kkathman		you'll have to download the version from the web site and install it
2005-04-09T11:17:00.000Z	kkathman		hoary isnt up to date either actually
2005-04-09T11:17:00.000Z	kkathman		current version of FF is 1.0.2
2005-04-09T11:17:00.000Z	kkathman		but at least hoary has 1.0
2005-04-09T11:17:00.000Z	membreya	kkathman	that's what hoary has
2005-04-09T11:18:00.000Z	kkathman	membreya	- I just d/l's 5.04 preview....it was 1.0  but they could have updated it yes
2005-04-09T11:18:00.000Z	membreya	kkathman	you might want to do a sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2005-04-09T11:19:00.000Z	kkathman	membreya	- I did that 304 updates last night :)
2005-04-09T11:20:00.000Z	kkathman	membreya	 I dont particularly like FF under linux...its non-performant. Opera is much better, hence why Im trying to get it installed
2005-04-09T11:21:00.000Z	membreya	kkathman	I prefer konqueror or if I'm using gnome I use galeon :)
2005-04-09T11:23:00.000Z	membreya	kkathman	http://galeon.sourceforge.net/
2005-04-09T11:24:00.000Z	membreya	kkathman	you can just do a sudo apt-get install galeon ..you will also need to do a sudo apt-get install mozilla-psm
2005-04-28T12:10:00.000Z	kkathman	membreya	Got a couple of Ims from you but you closed the pane I guess :)
2005-04-28T12:11:00.000Z	membreya	kkathman	you'll notice that it has sda or hda: // ..you need to take that out
2005-04-28T12:14:00.000Z	membreya	kkathman	got that launcher done now ? ;)
2005-04-28T12:16:00.000Z	kkathman	membreya	still having difficulties...typing I think..but I'll see
