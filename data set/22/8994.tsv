2007-09-15T10:34:00.000Z	Flannel		[nrx] : You dist-upgraded, what did you do with update-manager?
2007-09-15T10:35:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Flannel	it was sitting in the notification area saying there were 1044 packages that needed updating... so, I clicked on update. It started doing it's thing and about 30-45 imnutes into it (38%) there was an error saying it couldn't commit things. After that, it said update was complete and I rebooted.
2007-09-15T10:36:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Flannel	now, when I try and boot, i see that it fails on "loading hardware drivers" it gets to a point where it should fire up X and all I get is what looks like a test screen (all the colours in different shapes with numbers around and a progress bar in the middle) and it stops.. goes to a blank screen with a flashing cursor
2007-09-15T10:37:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Flannel	I can break out by hitting ctrl + alt + f1 and I get "/dev/null/ : permission denied about 30 times then if i hit ctrl + c I get a bash login prompt
2007-09-15T10:37:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Flannel	sources.list was all set to edgy, i was going from dapper
2007-09-15T10:38:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Flannel	problem now is that I don't have a connection on it :/
2007-09-15T10:38:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Flannel	I've checked.. the sources.list is all edgy
2007-09-15T10:39:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Flannel	it hasn't loaded the hardware drivers so I can't get wifi up
2007-09-15T10:39:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Flannel	the 1044 updates appeard after I did "apt-get dist-upgrade"
2007-09-15T10:40:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Flannel	i can try, give me a few minutes?
2007-09-15T10:42:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Flannel	i don't have enough patch cables :/
2007-09-15T10:42:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Flannel	I do have the original install CD that I downloaded 3-4 days ago though
2007-09-15T10:43:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Flannel	that was the idea, yeah
2007-09-15T10:44:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Flannel	when you download the iso, is the sources.list file already set as fiesty? I don't understand why the sources.list I ended up with was for dapper
2007-09-15T10:46:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Flannel	just so I don't feel stupid, http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/downloading?release=desktop-newest&arch=i386&mirror=http%3A%2F%2Fmirror.ox.ac.uk%2Fsites%2Freleases.ubuntu.com%2Freleases%2F&debug=%5B%27country_US%27%2C+%27country_UK%27%2C+%27continent_NA%27%5D&download-button=

2007-09-15T11:28:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Flannel	well, i've got it running with /dev/hda and the installer sees them and works with them as /dev/hda
