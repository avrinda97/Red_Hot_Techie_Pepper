2006-05-24T16:21:00.000Z	sczep		hallo, I like to do telnet connection from one Beezy PC to another one. I get "connection refused". How can I allow the connection??
2006-05-24T16:22:00.000Z	wedgeV	sczep	do you have telnetd running on the server?
2006-05-24T16:23:00.000Z	sczep		I do not, because I use only ssh normaly.
2006-05-24T16:23:00.000Z	wedgeV	sczep	yea, well, then it cant work ;)
2006-05-24T16:23:00.000Z	wedgeV	sczep	install telnetd then
2006-05-24T16:23:00.000Z	sczep		It is not the real problem.
2006-05-24T16:24:00.000Z	wedgeV	sczep	?
2006-05-24T16:25:00.000Z	sczep		I have on one PC a software license server over UDP running. The client should connect over the port 56797? But they cant contakt.
2006-05-24T16:25:00.000Z	sczep		So I used the telnet to test the connection
2006-05-24T16:25:00.000Z	wedgeV	sczep	telnet used tcp
2006-05-24T16:25:00.000Z	wedgeV		uses
2006-05-24T16:27:00.000Z	sczep		What is the reason for "connection refused" in a LAN??
2006-05-24T16:27:00.000Z	wedgeV	sczep	it just means that telnet cant connect to the port
2006-05-24T16:28:00.000Z	wedgeV	sczep	because your server listens on a udp port but telnet tries to connecnt to tcp
2006-05-24T16:28:00.000Z	sczep		how can I open the port ?
2006-05-24T16:29:00.000Z	sczep		The client can not connect to the UDP port ? How can I allow it ??
2006-05-24T16:29:00.000Z	wedgeV	sczep	do you have a firewall running?
2006-05-24T16:30:00.000Z	sczep		Only on the router, not in the interLAN
2006-05-24T16:32:00.000Z	sczep	wedgeV	Only on the router, not in the interLAN
2006-05-24T16:33:00.000Z	wedgeV	sczep	you can try and tcpdump to see if the packages arrive
2006-05-24T16:34:00.000Z	wedgeV	sczep	and use netstat to check if the server is really listening on the port its supposed to be
2006-05-24T16:35:00.000Z	sczep	wedgeV	how is the command to check a speciffic port ?
