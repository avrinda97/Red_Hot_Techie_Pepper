2007-10-16T12:19:00.000Z	drewbenn		Hey folks, still learning about linux/ubuntu: where, in the filesystem, is the 'Applications' (ubuntu feisty / gnome) menu located?  i.e. in MS Windows the Start Menu is a bunch of shortcuts located somewhere like \all users\<me>\start menu\ ... is the Ubuntu 'Applications' menu a similar beast, and if so, where is it?
2007-10-16T12:21:00.000Z	jmdc	drewbenn	its somewhat different than windows. The easiest thing is to right click on applications and choose edit menues
2007-10-16T12:22:00.000Z	jmdc	drewbenn	I think some people misunderstood you
2007-10-16T12:22:00.000Z	drewbenn	jmdc	I think so, too :)  I'm not specifically tring to edit the menu, just learn _where_ it is... there are a _lot_ of . directories in my home dir, so still trying to figure out what they all are & why.
2007-10-16T12:28:00.000Z	jmdc	drewbenn	its not actually a folder of links, its created by reading in a few files.
2007-10-16T12:28:00.000Z	drewbenn	jmdc	thanks, useful information: a different way of thinking.
2007-10-16T12:29:00.000Z	jmdc	drewbenn	It took me a long time to figure that out too.
2007-10-16T12:30:00.000Z	jmdc	drewbenn	I still don't really understand where it all comes from, and have accepted it as magic. If I really want to edit the menu, I can always right click on it and say "edit menus" but now I am curious, and I'm digging around looking for the relevant file.
2007-10-16T12:31:00.000Z	jmdc	drewbenn	I think the design is to have several files, one for the whole system, and then user customization files on top, but let me look around a bit
2007-10-16T12:32:00.000Z	drewbenn	jmdc	- magic's certainly okay :) ... until I try to figure out that piece of magic! Then I want to know the trick!  That's where I am with 'Applications'... starting small....
2007-10-16T12:33:00.000Z	jmdc	drewbenn	exactly. And I'm glad you're interested, because its providing a push to learn something thats been in the back of my mind a long time
2007-10-16T13:06:00.000Z	jmdc	drewbenn	I found out more about menus. /usr/share/applications contains many .desktop files. These create the menu items, and have lots of metadata and translations and stuff in them. Apparently, there is typically one .desktop file per menu item. So I was wrong about the multiple entries per file thing. Anyway, the menus are created out of those files (and probably could be created out of others too, if you told it to) by using a .menu file. .
2007-10-16T13:08:00.000Z	jmdc	drewbenn	also, did you see the comment about gnome-open? if not, gnome-open file does the right thing for you from the command line
2007-10-16T13:09:00.000Z	drewbenn	jmdc	yes, gnome-open is doing what I want, it is exactly waht I was looking for :)
2007-10-16T13:10:00.000Z	jmdc	drewbenn	its pretty hot stuff
2007-10-16T14:40:00.000Z	jmdc	drewbenn	I've used F-Spot, its cool.
2007-10-16T14:41:00.000Z	drewbenn	jmdc	it's in my applications menu, but I prefer ls and gimp :)
2007-10-16T14:54:00.000Z	drewbenn	jmdc	are you a 'we' that just wants the final release (i.e. user) or 'we' that is working on the final relase (i.e. developer)?
2007-10-16T14:55:00.000Z	jmdc	drewbenn	I'm a user. I've fixed a few bugs and such, but basicallyy I'm a user.
2007-10-16T14:57:00.000Z	jmdc	drewbenn	I shouldn't be careless and put on airs like that ;-)
2007-10-16T14:58:00.000Z	drewbenn	jmdc	sorry, I 'understand' from my internal corporate view, certainly nothing on the level of linux!  I've just been the focus of local management :)
2007-10-16T14:59:00.000Z	jmdc	drewbenn	hey if you can get managers to support linux ... I bow to you :-)
