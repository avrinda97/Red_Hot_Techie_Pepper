2010-02-14T06:12:00.000Z	infid		once i put a .ttf font in /usr/share/fonts/truetype do i have to re-login for xterm*font to recognize it?
2010-02-14T06:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	infid	verify the fonts you added are owned by root and then in /usr/local/share/fonts/tryptype (did you copy them here?) run "fc-cache" and see if that helps
2010-02-14T06:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	infid	see you put the link in your post try fc-cache in /usr/share/fonts/truetype
2010-02-14T06:20:00.000Z	infid	ZykoticK9	hmm tried it but xterm still says it cant load the font
2010-02-14T06:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	infid	does xterm actually use TTF fonts?
2010-02-14T07:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	infid	actually Chromium is the opensource project they base Chrome off of.
2010-02-14T07:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	infid	no really advantage to chromium right now -- does your chrome have bookmark syncing?  if not it's not the newest Chrome (there are a couple of bugs with Chromium that made there way into Google Chrome)

2010-05-02T11:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	infid	i think you should have installed Desktop rather then UNE if you didn't want the netbook interface and maximus
2010-05-02T11:36:00.000Z	infid	ZykoticK9	well i've disabled them before in the past
2010-05-02T11:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	infid	UNE is much more "locked down" then previous UNR versions it seams
2010-05-02T11:38:00.000Z	infid	ZykoticK9	that sucks, it got more and more locked down each time :( oh well i'll install desktop
2010-05-03T02:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	infid	it's not a bug with "commandline" infact that packages doesn't exist.  pvh_sa|wrk
2010-05-03T02:34:00.000Z	infid	ZykoticK9	i meant that the 'ubuntu-bug' is the command line tool, and the only way to send a bug report from ubuntu 10.04 lts
2010-05-03T02:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	infid	ubuntu-bug needs a package name after it
2010-05-03T02:34:00.000Z	infid	ZykoticK9	if you dont supply a package name it will try to help you diagnose the symptoms
2010-05-03T02:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	infid	really?  hilarious, thanks :)
2010-05-03T02:35:00.000Z	infid	ZykoticK9	yeah the man page advises not using arguments to ubuntu-bug at first
2010-11-13T23:46:00.000Z	infid	ZykoticK9	it's not offtopic i want to download ubuntu
2010-11-13T23:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	infid	ubuntu torrents available from ubuntu.com
