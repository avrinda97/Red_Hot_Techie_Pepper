2006-08-09T08:46:00.000Z	yey		hi, I'd like to try ubuntu
2006-08-09T08:46:00.000Z	Seveas	yey	that's a good idea
2006-08-09T08:46:00.000Z	Seveas	yey	yes it is
2006-08-09T08:47:00.000Z	yey	Seveas	which fs does it use?
2006-08-09T08:47:00.000Z	Seveas	yey	ext3, xfs, reiser, jfs...
2006-08-09T08:47:00.000Z	yey	Seveas	can it be easily set up to reiserfs during installation?
2006-08-09T08:47:00.000Z	Seveas	yey	yes, but i'd advise ext3
2006-08-09T08:47:00.000Z	yey	Seveas	why?
2006-08-09T08:50:00.000Z	Seveas	yey	good doesn't begin to describe it
2006-08-09T08:51:00.000Z	Seveas	yey	yes
2006-08-09T08:53:00.000Z	yey	Seveas	welp, bretzel, mindmedic: hmmm, I've chosen network installation for suse, can I do the same with ubuntu?
2006-08-09T08:54:00.000Z	Seveas	yey	what does suse mean with 'network installation'?
2006-08-09T08:54:00.000Z	yey	Seveas	no local installation media, everything downloaded during install.
2006-08-09T08:54:00.000Z	yey	Seveas	local starter only
2006-08-09T08:55:00.000Z	Seveas	yey	you can sort of do that but you need to start from an ubuntu cd anyway
2006-08-09T08:59:00.000Z	yey	Seveas	Why I canno join #ubuntu?
2006-08-09T08:59:00.000Z	Seveas	yey	you're in #ubuntu....
2006-08-09T08:59:00.000Z	yey	Seveas	irssi says #ubuntu-unregged
2006-08-09T09:00:00.000Z	Seveas	yey	that's in the list of modes of #ubuntu
2006-08-09T09:00:00.000Z	yey	Seveas	sorry for ot but what unregged means?
2006-08-09T09:13:00.000Z	yey	Seveas	I will try to use http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=151507
2006-08-09T09:13:00.000Z	yey	Seveas	nice solution, hope it works
