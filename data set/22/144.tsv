2012-05-24T06:50:00.000Z	piihb		Is there anyway to remove the Ubuntu partition from my laptop so I can re-install it?
2012-05-24T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piihb	 the installer can reformat it and use it again. no need to 'remove' it
2012-05-24T06:52:00.000Z	piihb	Dr_Willis	When I log in to Ubuntu, I can't do anything. I don't even have an option to shut down. I have to hold down the power button.
2012-05-24T06:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piihb	 try the rescue/recovery mode? if you want to reinstall.. boot the cd, and reinstall
2012-05-24T06:54:00.000Z	piihb	Dr_Willis	How do I get to recovery mode? On start up, when I choose Ubuntu, I don't think there's any recovery option.
2012-05-24T06:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piihb	 should be a nmenu item in the grub menus for some recovery/rescue option.
2012-05-24T06:56:00.000Z	piihb	Dr_Willis	Are the grub menus accessible on start up or do I have to log in/
2012-05-24T06:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piihb	 grub menu is he first boot menu items you see befor the main os starts up
2012-05-24T06:57:00.000Z	piihb	Dr_Willis	There's no time for me to do anything between the time I choose Ubuntu and the time it takes to load.
2012-05-24T07:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piihb	 'go to the windows partition'  = you mean boot to  windows?
2012-05-24T07:26:00.000Z	piihb	Dr_Willis	Yeah. I turned off the bluetooth on Ubuntu and now my wireless is automatically turned off every time I boot to Windows.
2012-05-24T07:30:00.000Z	piihb	Dr_Willis	What were you saying earlier about using recovery mode to reinstall, in a sense?
2012-05-24T07:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piihb	 you normally use recovery or rescue mode to 'fix' a broken system
2012-05-24T07:32:00.000Z	piihb	Dr_Willis	So how can I use that to fix my Bluetooth? Also, when I did recovery mode last time, I had to hold the power button on my laptop because I was staring a bunch of white text on a black background and nothing was happening
2012-05-24T07:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piihb	 i dont know how you turned off your blooth.. try turning it back on he same way?
2012-05-24T07:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piihb	 recovery/rescue mode is the console.. so  its text ... you  enter commands
2012-05-24T07:33:00.000Z	piihb	Dr_Willis	Didn't work. It should've been a simple click of a button, but it didn't give me the option.
2012-05-24T07:35:00.000Z	piihb	Dr_Willis	There's no way I can go over to the 32-bit now that I already installed the 64-bit?
2012-05-24T07:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piihb	 i always use 64bit.  if you want to go to 32bit.. you reinstggall
2012-05-24T07:36:00.000Z	piihb	Dr_Willis	Wouldn't that involve uninstalling first?
2012-05-24T07:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	piihb	 the installer can reformat the hard drive.
2012-05-24T07:42:00.000Z	piihb	Dr_Willis	Thanks! I uninstalled. I'll install it again tomorrow with help so I don't screw things up next time haha :P
