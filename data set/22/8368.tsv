2005-10-30T07:21:00.000Z	bob2	adriyel__	must NOT be accessible by other users
2005-10-30T07:22:00.000Z	bob2	adriyel__	chmod 600 blah
2005-10-30T07:22:00.000Z	adriyel__	bob2	use nautilus to fix it methinks :P
2005-10-30T07:24:00.000Z	adriyel__	bob2	see the above problem? chdir to /home/adriyel/.transgaming/wineserver-meow : Permission denied...wtf?
2005-10-30T07:25:00.000Z	bob2	adriyel__	you can't change into dirs you don't have permissions for
2005-10-30T07:25:00.000Z	bob2	adriyel__	600 denies you the ability to chdir (since it doesn't allow execute)
2005-10-30T07:25:00.000Z	bob2	adriyel__	you can make files inaccessible to yourself
2005-10-30T07:26:00.000Z	bob2	adriyel__	tho yo ucan of course immediately giveyourself permission back again
2005-10-30T07:26:00.000Z	adriyel__	bob2	it works now

2005-10-30T07:28:00.000Z	adriyel__	bob2	is there any reason why steam under cedega wouldn't be able to connect to the internet?
2005-10-30T07:28:00.000Z	bob2	adriyel__	no idea, #cedega, perhaps
2005-10-30T07:29:00.000Z	adriyel__	bob2	#cedega appears to be dead... :( *cries*

2005-10-30T08:08:00.000Z	adriyel__	bob2	this is the case of most Operating systems, if it tells you anything, and yet everything works, ignore all other output except that which is pertinent to the application in use
