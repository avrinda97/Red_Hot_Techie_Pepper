2010-02-09T16:56:00.000Z	jiohdi		I have remote desktop installed... I can control computer X with Y, but I only get the very first screen and from there the screen does not update...anyone?
2010-02-09T16:57:00.000Z	jiohdi		I can reverse this so that I can control Y with X but same thing, no screen updating
2010-02-09T16:57:00.000Z	jiohdi		anyone else run into this and know how to fix?
2010-02-09T16:58:00.000Z	jiohdi		ct?
2010-02-09T16:58:00.000Z	jiohdi		what is that?
2010-02-09T16:59:00.000Z	Spanglish_7776	jiohdi	I can't say i've had that issue, screen not refreshing.
2010-02-09T16:59:00.000Z	Spanglish_7776		same subnet?
2010-02-09T17:00:00.000Z	jiohdi		same router, side by side
2010-02-09T17:00:00.000Z	Spanglish_7776		have you tried a different client?
2010-02-09T17:00:00.000Z	jiohdi		suggestions?
2010-02-09T17:01:00.000Z	Spanglish_7776		on 9.10 I use remote desktop viewer, works great.
2010-02-09T17:02:00.000Z	jiohdi		that is what I am using, having the problem
2010-02-09T17:02:00.000Z	Spanglish_7776		hmm..
2010-02-09T17:02:00.000Z	jiohdi		I am using remote desktop server on both ends
2010-02-09T17:03:00.000Z	jiohdi		it connects fine, I can move the mouse on either machine from the other, just no screen refresh
2010-02-09T17:05:00.000Z	Spanglish_7776		joihdi, I'm wondering if you have view only mode on...
2010-02-09T17:05:00.000Z	Spanglish_7776		jiohdi*
2010-02-09T17:05:00.000Z	jiohdi		it is checked for allow others to view and allow others to control
2010-02-09T17:06:00.000Z	jiohdi		there are not that many settings on the client
2010-02-09T17:06:00.000Z	jiohdi		or server
2010-02-09T17:06:00.000Z	Spanglish_7776		when you connect, you should get an option to view only. be sure it's not checked.
2010-02-09T17:07:00.000Z	jiohdi	Spanglish_7776	view only would be the opposite condition... refresh but no control
