2005-06-25T06:56:00.000Z	onkarshinde		Can anybody help me playing movies using totem?
2005-06-25T06:56:00.000Z	onkarshinde		Do i need to install any extra library?
2005-06-25T06:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	onkarshinde	take a look at the url ubotu posted; has some instructions
2005-07-21T16:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	onkarshinde	system -> preferences -> keyboard and keyboard shortcuts
2005-10-23T11:31:00.000Z	onkarshinde	HappyFool	I think it is something $19
2005-10-23T11:34:00.000Z	HappyFool	onkarshinde	i think the problem will be figuring out how to interface to the hardware
2005-10-23T11:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	onkarshinde	out of my field of interest, sorry. good luck though ;). Check out jon corbet's book on linux device driver programming for tips (should be downloadable)
2005-11-07T12:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	onkarshinde	i don't think so. you can have multiple identities, which are switched by ~/.ssh/config
2005-11-07T12:21:00.000Z	onkarshinde	HappyFool	Can you explain further?
2005-11-07T12:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	onkarshinde	as i recall it wasn't too complicated. read 'man ssh_config'
2005-11-07T12:21:00.000Z	onkarshinde	HappyFool	Ok
2005-11-07T12:22:00.000Z	HappyFool	onkarshinde	i think you can specify a key/username per host, or something similar
2005-11-09T13:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	onkarshinde	at a guess they are python programs
2005-11-09T13:37:00.000Z	onkarshinde	HappyFool	GDM is not.
2005-11-09T13:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	onkarshinde	neither is file-roller. also, 'apt-cache depends file-roller' doesn't list python; must be a second-or-more level dependency.
2005-11-09T13:39:00.000Z	onkarshinde	HappyFool	That might be the case.
2005-11-09T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	onkarshinde	ah, looks like it might be launchpad-stuff
2006-02-18T12:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	onkarshinde	do the indian fonts look normal-sized in other apps ?
2006-02-18T12:51:00.000Z	onkarshinde	HappyFool	Which other apps?
2006-02-18T12:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	onkarshinde	i dunno, openoffice
2006-02-18T12:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	onkarshinde	my point is, sounds like a font problem
2006-02-18T12:51:00.000Z	onkarshinde	HappyFool	OpenOffice is okay. Gedit is not.
