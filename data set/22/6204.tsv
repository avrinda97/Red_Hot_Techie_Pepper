2007-03-02T12:55:00.000Z	pihus		is it good to go with ati radeon?
2007-03-02T12:56:00.000Z	con-man	pihus	in general?
2007-03-02T12:56:00.000Z	pihus		I just want to set up a multimonitor desktop. I have ati radeon and beryl
2007-03-02T12:57:00.000Z	con-man	pihus	I always had problems with ATI, and had to switch to nVidia
2007-03-02T12:57:00.000Z	pihus		well I'm useing laptop, so switching isn't that easy
2007-03-02T12:57:00.000Z	con-man	pihus	you can make it work
2007-03-02T12:58:00.000Z	pihus		with xinerama or something else?
2007-03-02T12:58:00.000Z	con-man		xinerama is used by ATI amirite?
2007-03-02T12:58:00.000Z	con-man	pihus	no wait thats twinview.
2007-03-02T12:58:00.000Z	con-man	pihus	xinerama should work with ati, I had it going for a while
2007-03-02T12:59:00.000Z	pihus		but twinview should be better?
2007-03-02T12:59:00.000Z	con-man	pihus	I think it is
2007-03-02T12:59:00.000Z	pihus		but do I have to restart my X server to switch from single to multi monitor?
2007-03-02T13:00:00.000Z	con-man	pihus	depends, are you running XGL?
2007-03-02T13:00:00.000Z	pihus	hengst	yes
2007-03-02T13:00:00.000Z	con-man	pihus	well you have to be running XGL if you are running beryl
