2011-11-08T07:01:00.000Z	tash		mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1: mke2fs 1.41.11 (14-Mar-2010) /dev/sdb1 is apparently in use by the system; will not make a filesystem here!
2011-11-08T07:01:00.000Z	tash		can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?
2011-11-08T07:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	tash	 sdb1 is mounted somewhere
2011-11-08T07:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	tash	 what fs is sdb1 now?
2011-11-08T07:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	tash	 i always use a gparted live cd normally to do this stuff. seems to cause less hassles.
2011-11-08T07:06:00.000Z	tash	dr_willis	http://pastie.org/2828680
2011-11-08T07:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	tash	 so what are you formating it to?
2011-11-08T07:17:00.000Z	tash	dr_willis	I want /dev/sdb1 to be ext4
2011-11-08T08:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	tash	 try mounting that fs now just to see if its allready formated
2011-11-08T08:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	tash	you tried just   rebootig, and trying the mkfs then?
2011-11-08T08:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	tash	 make sure theres no fstab entries for the hd first
2011-11-08T08:27:00.000Z	tash	dr_willis	no I haven't rebooted after creating the partition, then mkfs .. didn't even think of it
2011-11-08T08:27:00.000Z	tash	dr_willis	will try that next
2011-11-08T08:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	tash	 if you just made the partition. the kernal may be using the old info. theres some resync command that may get if figured out
2011-11-08T08:30:00.000Z	tash	dr_willis	I just created a primary partition, #1, on /dev/sdb so it is /dev/sdb1 ... just rebooted after making sure it isn't in fstab
2011-11-08T08:30:00.000Z	tash	dr_willis	/dev/sdb1 is apparently in use by the system; will not make a filesystem here!
2011-11-08T08:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	tash	 weird. wonder how its using it with no fs.
2011-11-08T08:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	tash	 there may be some force option to mkfs
2011-11-08T08:32:00.000Z	tash	dr_willis	man mkfs doesn't show any
2011-11-08T08:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	tash	 try mkfs --help
2011-11-08T08:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	tash	 this is a real machine, not some vps/vbox/other weirdness?
2011-11-08T08:37:00.000Z	tash	dr_willis	here is the output of trying to mount it... mount: unknown filesystem type 'LVM2_member'
