2006-05-13T09:32:00.000Z	hajuu		upgrade wont update your kernal
2006-05-13T09:33:00.000Z	hajuu		heh so use a different sound server?
2006-05-13T09:33:00.000Z	hajuu		not sure why it would be using so much cpu
2006-05-13T09:34:00.000Z	hajuu		...
2006-05-13T09:34:00.000Z	hajuu		alsa, oss... etc etc.
2006-05-13T09:34:00.000Z	hajuu		I like alsa
2006-05-13T09:34:00.000Z	hajuu		oh the new beta
2006-05-13T09:34:00.000Z	hajuu		artsd is not asla
2006-05-13T09:34:00.000Z	hajuu		er alsa
2006-05-13T09:35:00.000Z	hajuu		then just killall artsd and your good to go
2006-05-13T09:35:00.000Z	centar	hajuu	 ok thank you.
2006-05-13T09:29:00.000Z	centar	hajuu	 so, explain this to me, i go into the bash terminal, and simply type apt-get upgrade and it will install the new kde?
2006-05-13T09:30:00.000Z	centar	hajuu	 but i've enabled in the reposotories unstable versions.
2006-05-13T09:31:00.000Z	centar	hajuu	 is it good to update all components though?
2006-05-13T09:31:00.000Z	centar	hajuu	 he last time  i tried that, it kept telling me about to 'upgrade your boot loader before doing this' and mentioning lilo, so i just hit abort.
2006-05-13T09:32:00.000Z	centar	hajuu	 i wasn't, it told me if i had lilo. and it was a kernal upgrade
2006-05-13T09:32:00.000Z	centar	hajuu	 because i've spent about 10 hours setting it up now, so i didn't want to mess it up
2006-05-13T09:33:00.000Z	centar	hajuu	 also, artsd is being a pain in the ass, it's using 85% CPU, but if i disable it, it doesn't let me have sound
2006-05-13T09:33:00.000Z	centar	hajuu	 I am not aware currently of any other sound servers.
2006-05-13T09:34:00.000Z	centar	hajuu	 me neither, perhaps because i am using the new beta.
2006-05-13T09:34:00.000Z	centar	hajuu	 i am using alsa i believe
2006-05-13T09:34:00.000Z	centar	hajuu	 true, but in my system settings, it has alsa.
