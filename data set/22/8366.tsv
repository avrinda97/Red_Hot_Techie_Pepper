2008-11-29T14:56:00.000Z	melodie_	rdw200169	your bot is not qualified to answer. thks
2008-11-29T14:58:00.000Z	rdw200169	melodie_	are you pretty good at using the ubuntu alternate cd?
2008-11-29T14:58:00.000Z	melodie_	rdw200169	I just tried the alternate recuparation
2008-11-29T14:58:00.000Z	rdw200169	melodie_	ok, do this, go through the alternate disk, get it to detect the cd rom and the internet, then go to a shell
2008-11-29T14:59:00.000Z	melodie_	rdw200169	yes and then ? what with the shell ?
2008-11-29T14:59:00.000Z	rdw200169	melodie_	then, from the shell, mount the partition with your ubuntu in it, and chroot into it
2008-11-29T14:59:00.000Z	rdw200169	melodie_	then you can apt-get install grub, if you don't have it
2008-11-29T15:00:00.000Z	melodie_	rdw200169	its supposed to be installed, as all the files are there in /boot/grub, and in /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc
2008-11-29T15:00:00.000Z	rdw200169	melodie_	can you boot into ubuntu right now? i'm assuming the whole thing is trashed
2008-11-29T15:01:00.000Z	melodie_	rdw200169	I could boot into it until I reinstall the grub of my other distro on the mbr
2008-11-29T15:01:00.000Z	rdw200169	melodie_	well, you can, from that alternate cd installer, do a grub-install from the chroot
2008-11-29T15:02:00.000Z	rdw200169	melodie_	this sounds like your drive map is all screwed up, in /boot/grub in your uubntu partiton, or whatever partition is hosting /boot
2008-11-29T15:02:00.000Z	melodie_	rdw200169	I need to find the correct syntax to have it at /dev/sda9 though, that's what I'm looking for
2008-11-29T15:02:00.000Z	melodie_	rdw200169	yes, maybe the System.map
2008-11-29T15:02:00.000Z	rdw200169	melodie_	the best way to solve your grub problem, is having a separate /boot partition, and mounting that same partition in all your distros
2008-11-29T15:03:00.000Z	melodie_	rdw200169	false
2008-11-29T15:03:00.000Z	rdw200169	melodie_	yeah, the file that lists for grub where all the drives are
2008-11-29T15:03:00.000Z	rdw200169	melodie_	obviously, but grub needs to find all the kernels, and it usually looks in /boot
2008-11-29T15:04:00.000Z	melodie_	rdw200169	do you happen to know the syntax I'm looking for ? grub-install /dev/sda9 or grub-install root-device=/dev/sda9 or whatsoever ?
2008-11-29T15:04:00.000Z	rdw200169	melodie_	if all the distros your using are playing correctly, the different distros' kernels should not present a problem, naming convetion-wise
2008-11-29T15:05:00.000Z	melodie_	rdw200169	I'm not planning on creating a boot partition, I'm looking for the right cl
