2007-09-21T09:14:00.000Z	darlok		How can I setup a launcher to run in a terminal?
2007-09-21T09:14:00.000Z	darlok		Do I just use 'gnome-terminal [command] ?'
2007-09-21T09:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	darlok	when setting up launcher it is a option you have to select
2007-09-21T09:15:00.000Z	darlok	IdleOne	I see no such option.
2007-09-21T09:15:00.000Z	IdleOne	darlok	you see application?
2007-09-21T09:15:00.000Z	darlok	IdleOne	Oh, nevermind
2007-09-21T09:15:00.000Z	IdleOne	darlok	:)
2007-09-21T09:15:00.000Z	darlok	IdleOne	Thank you
2007-09-21T09:17:00.000Z	darlok	IdleOne	Another related question then.  I have a .xpm icon file in a folder but it doesn't show up when I'm creating a launcher (even when I browse to the correct folder)... any ideas?
2007-09-21T09:17:00.000Z	IdleOne	darlok	click view > show hidden or ctrl-h IIRC
2007-09-21T09:18:00.000Z	darlok	IdleOne	It isn't a hidden file, though.
2007-09-21T09:18:00.000Z	IdleOne	darlok	try it anyway
2007-09-21T09:18:00.000Z	darlok	IdleOne	I did... no luck.
2007-09-21T09:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	darlok	not certain. try moving that file to Desktop and see if it comes up
2007-09-21T09:19:00.000Z	darlok	IdleOne	Even tried typing in the complete path, but it couldn't use it because the "file already exists"
2007-09-21T09:19:00.000Z	darlok	IdleOne	Nope.. doesn't show up when it's on the desktop either.
2007-09-21T09:20:00.000Z	IdleOne	darlok	sorry I am not sure why it doesnt. try asking the channel in general maybe someone else can help[
2007-09-21T09:21:00.000Z	darlok	IdleOne	Well, turns out I can use that .xpm if I edit the properties AFTER I create the launcher.. not while creating the launcher.  Sounds like a bug to me.
2007-09-21T09:21:00.000Z	darlok	IdleOne	Thanks for your help.
2007-09-21T09:22:00.000Z	IdleOne	darlok	np glad you figure it out and if you think that is a bug file a report on launchpad
2007-09-30T05:52:00.000Z	darlok	IdleOne	Ah... didn't know Ubotu had that.  Thanks :)
2007-09-30T05:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	darlok	ubotu is all knowing :)
