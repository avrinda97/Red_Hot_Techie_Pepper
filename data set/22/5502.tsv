2007-04-24T12:38:00.000Z	platman	denis	you do not need an antivirus
2007-04-24T12:38:00.000Z	denis		why not platman
2007-04-24T12:39:00.000Z	platman	denis	you will not get any viruses. all the viruses in the wild are mostly windows viruses
2007-04-24T12:40:00.000Z	denis	platman	ok as a windows long time user that makes me nervous
2007-04-24T12:40:00.000Z	platman	denis	former windows users are obsessed with anti-virus
2007-04-24T12:40:00.000Z	platman		just let it go and enjoy the extra ram
2007-04-24T12:41:00.000Z	denis	platman	yes and I know why, do I not need anti spyware neither
2007-04-24T12:41:00.000Z	platman	denis	nope

2007-04-24T12:42:00.000Z	platman	denis	no prob. just enjoy USING your computer, not maintaining it
2007-04-24T12:42:00.000Z	denis	platman	ok thanks for that
2007-04-24T12:44:00.000Z	platman		parmenion: only one. you can still send and receive viruses, they just cant run in your system
2007-04-24T12:44:00.000Z	platman		so you can infect all of your windows friends
2007-04-24T12:46:00.000Z	platman		flannel: the way i figure is that considering the amount of enterprise servers running linux and no one writes viruses for the,
2007-04-24T12:46:00.000Z	platman		the,* ever wonder why?
2007-04-24T12:46:00.000Z	denis		Platman should I uninstall the firewall as well?
2007-04-24T12:46:00.000Z	platman		keep the firewall
2007-04-24T12:46:00.000Z	platman		that's the only one you should keep
2007-04-24T12:46:00.000Z	denis	platman	ok
2007-04-24T12:47:00.000Z	denis	platman	again though I have to start it manually
2007-04-24T12:47:00.000Z	platman	denis	i dont use any firewalls personally, i only keep pr0n and music on my computer
