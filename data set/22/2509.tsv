2009-05-27T02:50:00.000Z	equivoc		:O
2009-05-27T02:50:00.000Z	equivoc		:)
2009-05-27T02:51:00.000Z	equivoc		got a problem establishing an ssh tunnel
2009-05-27T02:51:00.000Z	equivoc		ssh -g -L 8080:192.168.0.2:80 127.0.0.1
2009-05-27T02:51:00.000Z	equivoc		sais: bind: Address already in use
2009-05-27T02:51:00.000Z	equivoc		errr
2009-05-27T02:51:00.000Z	equivoc		says
2009-05-27T02:52:00.000Z	equivoc		if i leave -g away it works
2009-05-27T02:52:00.000Z	equivoc		but not for remote machines
2009-05-27T02:53:00.000Z	losher	equivoc	I've never used -g with ssh. What's it supposed to do?
2009-05-27T02:54:00.000Z	equivoc	losher	-g      Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.
2009-05-27T02:55:00.000Z	losher	equivoc	Kalmi_ : so how does that work. Can't anyone connect to 8080 anyway?
2009-05-27T02:58:00.000Z	losher	equivoc	Kalmi_ : so then presumably ssh does a check whenever anyone connects to 8080 on the ssh client. I don't see how that leads to the symptoms described...
2009-05-27T02:59:00.000Z	losher	equivoc	Kalmi_ : ok, try adding '-v' to your ssh command & see if it gives any clues
2009-05-27T03:00:00.000Z	losher	equivoc	Kalmi_ : unrelated, but it triggers the symptoms :-)
2009-05-27T03:00:00.000Z	losher	equivoc	Kalmi_ : -v, and pastebin the output?
2009-05-27T03:01:00.000Z	losher	equivoc	Kalmi_ : some new meaning of 'unrelated' I must be unfamiliar with then :-)
2009-05-27T03:05:00.000Z	losher	equivoc	Kalmi_ : yep, me three. I see from '-v' that it starts a tcp listen on 0.0.0.0:8080. That's not what I expected. I thought it simply added a check when a new incoming connection is made. Bug or feature?
2009-05-27T03:08:00.000Z	losher	equivoc	Kalmi_ : it seems to work ok though. Before ssh, nothing listening on 8080. After ssh, even with the error msg, 8080 is listening & forwarding to 80...
2009-05-27T03:10:00.000Z	equivoc	losher	right
2009-05-27T03:10:00.000Z	losher	equivoc	Kalmi_ : so we've found a cosmetic error, nothing more?
