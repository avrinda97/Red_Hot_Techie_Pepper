2010-07-30T11:22:00.000Z	plum-mobile		Hey guys
2010-07-30T11:22:00.000Z	plum-mobile		My dad is trying to install ubuntu from his laptop
2010-07-30T11:22:00.000Z	plum-mobile		The progress bar is stuck at 79
2010-07-30T11:22:00.000Z	saegeoff	plum-mobile	from or to?
2010-07-30T11:22:00.000Z	plum-mobile	saegeoff	to
2010-07-30T11:23:00.000Z	saegeoff	plum-mobile	 dual booting or single boot?
2010-07-30T11:23:00.000Z	plum-mobile	saegeoff	dual booting
2010-07-30T11:24:00.000Z	saegeoff	plum-mobile	 how long has it been stuck?
2010-07-30T11:24:00.000Z	plum-mobile	saegeoff	it has been there for almost an hour at 79%, but the number of files its retrieving changes.
2010-07-30T11:26:00.000Z	saegeoff	plum-mobile	 its just downloading files really slow.  you have have to just let it go for a long time
2010-07-30T11:26:00.000Z	saegeoff	plum-mobile	 if it is changing the files then it is downloading, just slowly
2010-07-30T11:27:00.000Z	saegeoff	plum-mobile	 it will just postpone the updates until a later time.  you can press that
2010-07-30T11:28:00.000Z	saegeoff	plum-mobile	 I do suggest you get the updates installed asap though.
2010-07-30T11:28:00.000Z	plum-mobile	saegeoff	so is it actually updating to a newer version of ubuntu then?
2010-07-30T11:28:00.000Z	saegeoff	plum-mobile	 not necessarily.  It is just getting the recent updates
2010-07-30T11:29:00.000Z	plum-mobile	saegeoff	thank you for the help on this. We will keep watching it
2010-07-30T11:30:00.000Z	saegeoff	plum-mobile	 good luck!
2010-07-30T11:32:00.000Z	saegeoff	plum-mobile	 good question.  maybe it isnt connected and it just is attempting each file until it times out on each attempt.  Just skip that process for now
2010-07-30T11:32:00.000Z	plum-mobile	saegeoff	alright we'll skip it
2010-07-30T11:34:00.000Z	saegeoff	plum-mobile	 any luck?
2010-07-30T11:36:00.000Z	plum-mobile	saegeoff	web browser works, he clicked a link in the installer
2010-07-30T11:36:00.000Z	saegeoff	plum-mobile	 good!
