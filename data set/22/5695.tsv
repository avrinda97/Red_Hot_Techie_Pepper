2007-06-08T12:17:00.000Z	tom__		Niekie: Output: direct rendering: Yes
2007-06-08T12:18:00.000Z	tom__		Niekie: heh - Always a start i guess =)
2007-06-08T12:18:00.000Z	Zenerek	tom__	in fact i think up to x1900 type cards are supported
2007-06-08T12:27:00.000Z	tom__	Zenerek	Niekie: I have all the funky effects working - i just have a lousy resolution of 1024 x 768 - i just want to up it to 1280 x 1024 at least

2007-06-08T12:51:00.000Z	tom__	Zenerek	A Dialup modem or a ADSL One? 0.o
2007-06-08T12:53:00.000Z	tom__	Zenerek	- heh Modems - never thought i would hear that word again
2007-06-08T12:56:00.000Z	tom__	Zenerek	- Sometimes i wish linux was a little more - Adaptable to hardware =(
2007-06-08T12:57:00.000Z	tom__	Zenerek	- i have tried most distros - feddora, black box, open suse, sled, etc
2007-06-08T12:58:00.000Z	tom__	Zenerek	- but in my opinion - Ubuntu has the better user base!! Mush more friendlier and more helpful
2007-06-08T13:03:00.000Z	tom__	Zenerek	Whats up with firefox? I used opera in the past but prefered Firefox tbh
2007-06-08T13:06:00.000Z	Zenerek	tom__	nothing against firefox, but opera is damn powerfull damn fast and you don't have to download a gangload of extentions to do what opera does out of the box, of course it's better for those just wana leave ie and have more security and much better features
2007-06-08T13:06:00.000Z	tom__	Zenerek	True - it used to be a little bloated last time i used it (a few years back) is it worth giving it another whirl?
2007-06-08T13:08:00.000Z	tom__	Zenerek	- might give it another shot then - got any other cool apps i should try out?
2007-06-08T13:10:00.000Z	Zenerek	tom__	you might wana get wine, allows you to run windows apps in linux,be aware it has it's limits, then you want to get firestarer (firewall)
2007-06-08T13:10:00.000Z	tom__	Zenerek	Yeah i tried Wine when i used to be on Fedora- but it broke and i have had nightmares ever since =(
2007-06-08T13:12:00.000Z	tom__	Zenerek	Awesome - i will give that another try too. Im just about to embark on installing MySQL!
2007-06-08T13:13:00.000Z	Zenerek	tom__	phew is all i can say, never ever touched it, worried about hard that's going to be, currently reading two ubuntu books and have many little notes docs about ubuntu
2007-06-08T13:14:00.000Z	tom__	Zenerek	I just fired up a guide on google and giving it a shot - what books have you got? Are they any good?
2007-06-08T13:17:00.000Z	Zenerek	tom__	well i got the oficial ubuntu book and ubuntu unleased, both are about dapper drake(ubuntu 6.06) which is what i am running here, unleased seems more advanced though in fact it says so in the user abilities part on the book cover
2007-06-08T13:17:00.000Z	Zenerek	tom__	oops i mean the book called ubuntu unleashed
