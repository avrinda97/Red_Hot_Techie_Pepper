2006-12-08T16:44:00.000Z	DARKGuy		Actually..
2006-12-08T16:44:00.000Z	DARKGuy		=S
2006-12-08T16:44:00.000Z	DARKGuy		!WorksForMe
2006-12-08T16:45:00.000Z	DARKGuy		every machine is different :P
2006-12-08T16:47:00.000Z	DARKGuy		I wonder... does anybody know why in ktorrent, the speed goes up for a bit, then goes to zero, increases and decreases again... that never happened to me in Windows, is it normal? oO
2006-12-08T16:48:00.000Z	agent	DARKGuy	it did that in windows too... windows just lies and tells you that it is constant
2006-12-08T16:48:00.000Z	DARKGuy	agent	Lol I see
2006-12-08T16:48:00.000Z	agent	DARKGuy	don't trust windows for anything :)
2006-12-08T16:49:00.000Z	DARKGuy	agent	since I entered the Linux world, not anymore :P
2006-12-08T16:50:00.000Z	agent	DARKGuy	well, assuming that you have the same internet connection and are connected to the same node... the thing is, you may be using some far away unstable note - in truth, it could also be the bt client you are using - it may be buggy but the chances are very slim on that one
2006-12-08T16:51:00.000Z	agent	DARKGuy	note = node... you are using the internet and are sharing files - there are a lot of things that happen but don't worry, it is very normal for your connection to go up and down especially when there are not many people sharing that file
2006-12-08T16:52:00.000Z	DARKGuy	agent	I think you may be right - then again, Azureus just doesn't work if I kill the X because of (I assume) corrupt downloaded bits, and bittornado doesn't resume the torrents so :P
2006-12-08T16:52:00.000Z	DARKGuy	agent	I see o.o;
2006-12-08T16:54:00.000Z	agent	DARKGuy	well, that azureus thing is probably a bug in azureus - the question remains whether that means its a "real" bug or the bug that azureus uses java :)
2006-12-08T16:54:00.000Z	DARKGuy	agent	Maybe both ;) xD
2006-12-08T16:54:00.000Z	agent	DARKGuy	probably....
2006-12-08T16:56:00.000Z	agent	DARKGuy	you are on kde, right? ive never had a problem with the default bt client in gnome, except that it is not possible to download multiple files at the same time (but thats not a bug) - you can try deluge its developed by ubuntu enthusiasts... it has its own forum on ubuntuforums
2006-12-08T16:57:00.000Z	DARKGuy	agent	actually, I'm in Fluxbox installed in a Xubuntu distro :P, and I can't recall the name of the default bt client in gnome.. what was it?
2006-12-08T16:58:00.000Z	agent	DARKGuy	 gnome-btdownload
2006-12-09T17:03:00.000Z	DARKGuy	agent	ah yes, I've tried that one too, didn't like it much :P
2006-12-15T09:57:00.000Z	DARKGuy	agent	okay, but that isn't the alternate CD that you all talk about, right?
