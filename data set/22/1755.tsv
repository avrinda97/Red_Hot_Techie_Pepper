2010-01-22T14:16:00.000Z	MegaHerz		How to load alsa? I've unloaded alsa modules via (sudo /sbin/alsa force-unload) and now want sound back without restarting whole the system
2010-01-22T14:16:00.000Z	tarzeau_	MegaHerz	modprobe what you unloaded?
2010-01-22T14:17:00.000Z	MegaHerz	tarzeau_	I've just executed that script. I don't know what modules it unloaded. Is there a way to... just start alsa?
2010-01-22T14:18:00.000Z	MegaHerz	tarzeau_	or how to make system to reindentify needed modules?
2010-01-22T14:18:00.000Z	MegaHerz	tarzeau_	and load them too
2010-01-22T14:18:00.000Z	tarzeau_	MegaHerz	no idea, sorry
2010-01-22T14:19:00.000Z	tarzeau_	MegaHerz	no it's nice
2010-01-22T14:19:00.000Z	tarzeau_	MegaHerz	you just shouldn't force unload modules, really
2010-01-22T14:19:00.000Z	MegaHerz	tarzeau_	yes, looks like
2010-01-22T14:20:00.000Z	tarzeau_	MegaHerz	i never have to restart alsa (besides it's not a service one can restart) it's kernel modules
2010-01-22T14:20:00.000Z	MegaHerz	tarzeau_	but alsa force-reload didn't help this time
2010-01-22T14:20:00.000Z	tarzeau_	MegaHerz	and it just works for me
2010-01-22T14:20:00.000Z	tarzeau_	MegaHerz	what computer/soundcard do you have? which applications do you use?
2010-01-22T14:20:00.000Z	tarzeau_	MegaHerz	if you use gnome/kde the artsdaemon and the other softwaremixer, that's crap
2010-01-22T14:21:00.000Z	MegaHerz	tarzeau_	but not for me. Without 'force-reload' "cheat" I can't get sound more then 2-4 hours. Apps like MOCP can't start, claiming it can't access something. So I have to force-reload alsa, and then MOCP works
2010-01-22T14:21:00.000Z	tarzeau_	MegaHerz	you run karmic?
2010-01-22T14:22:00.000Z	tarzeau_	MegaHerz	try to use OSS instead of ALSA, if that works better, i don't know
2010-01-22T14:22:00.000Z	tarzeau_	MegaHerz	did you check the mocp bugs/development page, maybe it's known?
2010-01-22T14:22:00.000Z	MegaHerz	tarzeau_	MOCP application, 9.04, latest (I think) alsa (built using that fancy script found on Ubuntu forums)
2010-01-22T14:22:00.000Z	tarzeau_	MegaHerz	or try to figure out what software is causing the problems
2010-01-22T14:22:00.000Z	tarzeau_	MegaHerz	i'm pretty sure it's not alsa
2010-01-22T14:23:00.000Z	MegaHerz	tarzeau_	yeah, default 9.04's alsa cound't even work on my laptop - Acer 5930G :( So I had to built latest
