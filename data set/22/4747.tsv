2007-10-24T06:12:00.000Z	LifeNomad		The network manager in buntu with the VPN support is so intuitive....they need to work on that.
2007-10-24T06:12:00.000Z	LifeNomad		Does anyone else hate the network manager?
2007-10-24T06:13:00.000Z	attackdecay	LifeNomad	yes, and my number one reason is that it's VPN config section is unavailable when not using 'roaming mode'
2007-10-24T06:13:00.000Z	LifeNomad	attackdecay	I TOTALLY agree!
2007-10-24T06:14:00.000Z	LifeNomad	attackdecay	Do you use wifi?
2007-10-24T06:15:00.000Z	attackdecay	LifeNomad	i was..  but i've upgraded to gutsy and need to recompile madwifi (macbook c2d)
2007-10-24T06:15:00.000Z	LifeNomad	attackdecay	Oh macbook...ahh I see
2007-10-24T06:16:00.000Z	LifeNomad	attackdecay	But you can "manually configure" your wifi and take it off roaming
2007-10-24T06:16:00.000Z	attackdecay	LifeNomad	 and madwifi still has a bug that is really a bother with my wifi shipset
2007-10-24T06:17:00.000Z	LifeNomad	attackdecay	Yea macs have some troubles
2007-10-24T06:17:00.000Z	attackdecay	LifeNomad	 roaming mode works great for me, for everything except my parents' random static ip dsl
2007-10-24T06:17:00.000Z	LifeNomad	attackdecay	Well even on my linksys router....with no encryption and DHCP....I cannot connect until I go off of roaming....
2007-10-24T06:18:00.000Z	attackdecay	LifeNomad	 for the most part, however, ubuntu on my macbook is working wonderfully, integrating with an all M$ office no problems, vpn, rdp, exchange, smb over vpn, all god
2007-10-24T06:19:00.000Z	attackdecay	LifeNomad	 now that is strange...  i had great luck, before coming to my parents to visit, with roaming mode and wpa2 security, dhcp, and it also remembered my preferred network even when it wasn't the strongest signal available
2007-10-24T06:19:00.000Z	attackdecay	LifeNomad	 yeah, windows file sharing with a m$ vpn
2007-10-24T06:19:00.000Z	LifeNomad	attackdecay	Yea, I can connect to other peoples wifi in this building, except my own....have to go roaming
2007-10-24T06:20:00.000Z	attackdecay	LifeNomad	to be quite honest, my networkmanger troubles, save the 'no vpn while off roaming' thing, all worked themselves out without too much fuss..  at this point i can't honestly remember exactly what i did to get things smooth
2007-10-24T06:21:00.000Z	LifeNomad	attackdecay	hmm, mine are still that way....oh well
2007-10-24T06:23:00.000Z	attackdecay	LifeNomad	 i tell ya tho, i think they'll whip network manager into shape in the near future, for what it is, its pretty good
2007-10-24T06:23:00.000Z	LifeNomad	attackdecay	I will agree, its alright, just needs some work
2007-10-24T06:23:00.000Z	attackdecay	LifeNomad	 there are some things that are way better, imho, than the way other 'popular' os's work
2007-10-24T06:24:00.000Z	LifeNomad	attackdecay	Oh yea, Linux Mint's old network manager sucked so bad, but with the new one...it still needs work.
