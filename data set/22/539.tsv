2012-03-17T20:15:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	Robinux	If you have kde qt otherwise gtk
2012-03-17T20:15:00.000Z	Robinux		gnome3 here
2012-03-17T20:16:00.000Z	Robinux		which I'm regretting btw
2012-03-17T20:16:00.000Z	Robinux		and will install cinnamon GirlyGirl
2012-03-17T20:16:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	Robinux	The gtk to integrate with the desktop
2012-03-17T20:16:00.000Z	Robinux		so I should still install gtk... cuz cinnamon is just the cousine of gnome right
2012-03-17T20:16:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	Robinux	yes
2012-03-17T20:16:00.000Z	Robinux	GirlyGirl	thank you.
2012-03-17T20:17:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	Robinux	Both will work, but qt is generally better if you are on kde which btw would be worth trying if you dislike gnome 3
2012-03-17T20:17:00.000Z	Robinux	GirlyGirl	what will happen if I install cinnamon and kde... while I have gnome
2012-03-17T20:17:00.000Z	Robinux		3
2012-03-17T20:18:00.000Z	Robinux		your one and only, dawg! bro
2012-03-17T20:18:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	Robinux	You can chose between session types on the login screen
2012-03-17T20:19:00.000Z	Robinux		will I need to install something special that'll let me choose between the session types?
2012-03-17T20:19:00.000Z	Robinux	GirlyGirl	^^?
2012-03-17T20:19:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	Robinux	But better try a Kubuntu livecd and see if you like it. Although desktop effects for some reason don't work well the first time so turn them on and of in settings
2012-03-17T20:20:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	Robinux	No, when prompted while installing however chose KDM as display manager
2012-03-17T20:20:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	Robinux	To install KDE do "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop"
2012-03-17T20:20:00.000Z	Robinux		k
2012-03-17T20:21:00.000Z	Robinux		I see.
2012-03-17T20:21:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	Robinux	But as I said better try a livecd first
