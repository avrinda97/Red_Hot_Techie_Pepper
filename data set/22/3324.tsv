2009-05-15T10:25:00.000Z	ripdisk		is it normal to see a bunch of SQUASHFS error while loading the ubuntu setup?
2009-05-15T10:25:00.000Z	ripdisk		oh, i'm guessing it's not, because it just took me to a terminal..
2009-05-15T10:25:00.000Z	ripdisk		heh.
2009-05-15T10:26:00.000Z	losher	ripdisk	not normal. My first guess is a dirty CD...
2009-05-15T10:56:00.000Z	losher	ripdisk	bad dvd reader?
2009-05-15T11:11:00.000Z	losher	ripdisk	google the exact model + install problems. 9.04 I presume?
2009-05-15T11:20:00.000Z	losher	ripdisk	run md5sum on the cd?
2009-05-15T11:21:00.000Z	losher	ripdisk	exact model of the dell? Version of the OS you're installing?
2009-05-15T11:22:00.000Z	ripdisk	losher	dell demension e310, newest ubuntu available on the site

2009-05-15T11:26:00.000Z	ripdisk	losher	my errors are different
2009-05-15T11:26:00.000Z	losher	ripdisk	run md5sum on the cd?
2009-05-15T11:27:00.000Z	losher	ripdisk	just stop bellyaching and run md5sum
2009-05-15T11:29:00.000Z	losher	ripdisk	:-). Actually, I wanted to verify the burn, but I realise if you can't run the livecd, it can't be done.
2009-05-15T11:31:00.000Z	losher	ripdisk	that would verify the disk, which is good, but I really wanted to verify the entire hardware chain i.e. disk, controller, dvd reader etc. which you can't do, right?
2009-05-15T11:32:00.000Z	losher	ripdisk	at this point, I'd download something else e.g. DSL and see if that boots. If it does, you'll know there's something weird about Ubuntu. If not, you definitely have a harware problem...
2009-05-15T11:35:00.000Z	losher	ripdisk	actually, systemrescue might be ideal: http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page
2009-05-15T11:37:00.000Z	losher	ripdisk	sorry?
2009-05-15T11:39:00.000Z	losher	ripdisk	you can do all sorts with system rescue, including partitioning, fscking disks etc. But I basically want to verify if your hardware can boot *any* kind of linux successfully. since you've obviously drawn a complete blank with Ubuntu twice over now...
2009-05-15T11:43:00.000Z	losher	ripdisk	decided what to do next?
2009-05-15T11:45:00.000Z	ripdisk	losher	i gotta get some sleep actually i'll try that stuff tomorrow
2009-05-15T11:45:00.000Z	losher	ripdisk	ok, best of luck...
