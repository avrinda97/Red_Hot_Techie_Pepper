2011-08-12T21:12:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		And I'm not quite sure what you mean.
2011-08-12T21:14:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		Oh yeah.
2011-08-12T21:15:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		You see, I never had ubuntu on my disk, although I did have linux MINT.
2011-08-12T21:15:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		And I deleted that partition without realizing GRUB 2 was on it.
2011-08-12T21:15:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		My friend told me installing Ubuntu should fix the problem.. although Im' not sure how yet. Haha.
2011-08-12T21:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	Shadowwolf	 there was an original problem?
2011-08-12T21:16:00.000Z	Shadowwolf	dr_willis	what are you referring to?
2011-08-12T21:17:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		The problem of it not booting?

2011-08-12T21:17:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		Yes. The problem of not booting.
2011-08-12T21:17:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		When I start it, I get error: no such partition
2011-08-12T21:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	Shadowwolf	 reinstalling ubuntu to fix ubuntu not booting?
2011-08-12T21:17:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		No.
2011-08-12T21:17:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		Nothing boots.
2011-08-12T21:17:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		I've never had it on.
2011-08-12T21:17:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		Er.
2011-08-12T21:17:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		I've never had ubuntu.
2011-08-12T21:17:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		But I've always had a LiveCD lying around.
2011-08-12T21:18:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		Yes.
2011-08-12T21:18:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		Windows 7.
2011-08-12T21:18:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		But I don't know how to allow it to boot.
2011-08-12T21:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	Shadowwolf	 you might get lucky and try the  live cd is aw that has a fixboot tool -> http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=10084551&postcount=1   in theory it should fix ubuntu, that will let you boot the other os;s
