2008-08-10T19:33:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		possibly a reason why on a fresh install 2nd round of updates are held back.. most i'm curious as to why 2.6.24-19-generic is being held back
2008-08-10T19:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bastid_raZor	you gotta dist-upgrade to get em
2008-08-10T19:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bastid_raZor	dist upgrade is used to update the big stuff (like kernels)
2008-08-10T19:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bastid_raZor	i always use sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-08-10T19:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bastid_raZor	im used to kde apps

2008-12-21T07:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bastid_raZor	i work for a huge company with a tonne of redundancy and our availablity is 99.9999, we are pushing to get 99.99999 right now
2008-12-21T07:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bastid_raZor	1 hour out of 3 months is not 100% availability
2008-12-21T07:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bastid_raZor	if the system works, dont fix it, if its broken you need to act. You could analyse access patterns and work on it when there is least access to minimise impact
2008-12-21T07:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bastid_raZor	resolving the issue will allow the system to function better so is like an investment
