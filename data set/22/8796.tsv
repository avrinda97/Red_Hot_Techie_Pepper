2005-06-16T07:13:00.000Z	mpm		wow... I just uncovered the hugeness of my ~/.thumbnails folder!!! which application created this monstrous cache??
2005-06-16T07:14:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	perhaps nautilus?
2005-06-16T07:17:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	/home /etc and /var would be a good start
2005-06-16T07:19:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	but when you restore, you don't neccessarily need to restore /etc and /var.  they are great to have lying around, though.
2005-06-16T07:19:00.000Z	mpm	pestilence	have you done what I'm doing before?
2005-06-16T07:20:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	reinstalled the OS?  plenty of times :)  every time my laptop has to go back to gateway for a repair, in fact
2005-06-16T07:22:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	well, i always restore those, but if what you're looking for is that "factory fresh" feeling, i guess have at it
2005-06-16T07:23:00.000Z	mpm	pestilence	so how do you do the homedir backup?  tarball everything?  does that include the hidden files?
2005-06-16T07:24:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	i prefer rdiff-backup, but you could do a tar cvf home.tar /home
2005-06-16T07:24:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	that *should* work.
2005-06-16T07:25:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	it's rdiff-backup
2005-06-16T07:30:00.000Z	mpm	pestilence	thanks for the rdiff-backup tip, I'm reading the man page now... any favorite combo of flags you could show me?
2005-06-16T07:30:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	not really.  sometimes i will have it ignore caches and whatnot
2005-06-16T07:30:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	but if i'm feeling lazy, i'll just let it go to town
2005-06-16T07:31:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	and lately i've been very lazy :)
2005-06-16T07:31:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	it's a great tool for doing daily backups
2005-06-16T07:31:00.000Z	mpm	pestilence	you ever tie it to a cron?
2005-06-16T07:32:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	absolutely
2005-06-16T07:33:00.000Z	mpm	pestilence	you can change your version in about:config
2005-06-16T07:34:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	i'm too lazy to do that.
2005-06-16T07:35:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	since they know about the bug, they should let ubuntu users click through
2005-06-16T07:37:00.000Z	pestilence	mpm	but yes, that should do it
