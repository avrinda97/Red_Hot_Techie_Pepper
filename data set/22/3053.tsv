2008-12-21T04:40:00.000Z	Zerocool947		I have a problem. My sound is extremely soft and almost unhearable in any program at max volume. Is there a way to fix this?
2008-12-21T04:40:00.000Z	adaptr	Zerocool947	there are at least 3 volume settings, make sure each is at a reasonable level
2008-12-21T04:41:00.000Z	Zerocool947	adaptr	I found 2) 1st is my laptop, second is the volume button on the top toolbar. Where's the third?
2008-12-21T04:42:00.000Z	adaptr	Zerocool947	right-click that and select volume control
2008-12-21T04:43:00.000Z	Zerocool947	adaptr	that worked, but I discovered that my laptop controls do absolutely nothing. Is there anyone to fix this?
2008-12-21T04:45:00.000Z	adaptr	Zerocool947	there are packages to deal with that , for specific laptops
2008-12-21T04:45:00.000Z	adaptr	Zerocool947	apt-cache search laptop, or something :)
2008-12-21T04:46:00.000Z	Zerocool947	adaptr	I have this long list of dealies. how do I process any of this?
2008-12-21T04:46:00.000Z	adaptr	Zerocool947	I don't know what you mean
2008-12-21T04:46:00.000Z	Zerocool947	adaptr	what do I do with any of these things
2008-12-21T04:46:00.000Z	adaptr	Zerocool947	you search through them to see if anything matches your laptop make/model
2008-12-21T04:47:00.000Z	adaptr	Zerocool947	and there's also a generic set of tools for laptop controls
2008-12-21T04:47:00.000Z	Zerocool947	adaptr	so once I find something that might apply to me, what do I do with it?
2008-12-21T04:48:00.000Z	adaptr	Zerocool947	you install it in the normal way
2008-12-21T04:48:00.000Z	Zerocool947	adaptr	I am a complete noob. What is the normal way?
2008-12-21T04:48:00.000Z	adaptr	Zerocool947	ah.. in that case just use synaptic
2008-12-21T04:49:00.000Z	Zerocool947	adaptr	Synaptic?
2008-12-21T04:49:00.000Z	adaptr	Zerocool947	have you only just now installed ubuntu ? like, 5 minutes ago ?
2008-12-21T04:50:00.000Z	Zerocool947	adaptr	well 5 hours ago, but the idea is the same
2008-12-21T04:50:00.000Z	adaptr	Zerocool947	synaptic is the normal way of installing software, it's in the system menu
2008-12-21T04:50:00.000Z	adaptr	Zerocool947	explore your system!
2008-12-21T04:50:00.000Z	Zerocool947	adaptr	oh that thing, right, I've been playing around with that
