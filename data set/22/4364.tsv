2012-06-06T18:58:00.000Z	sl0w		does anyone know how to enable external monitors when using Ubuntu 12 (on a laptop)? Mine is not being detected even though the driver should be installed
2012-06-06T18:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sl0w	what GPU?
2012-06-06T18:59:00.000Z	sl0w	ActionParsnip	nvidia?
2012-06-06T18:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sl0w	sure, then use nvidia-settings. I assume you installed the proprietary driver
2012-06-06T19:00:00.000Z	sl0w	ActionParsnip	how do I check to make sure? when I did a search earlier it said that ACER monitors were supposed to have the drivers preinstalled with Ubuntu... but I'd like to verify that
2012-06-06T19:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sl0w	lspci | grep -i vga
2012-06-06T19:01:00.000Z	sl0w	ActionParsnip	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GT216 [GeForce GT 230M] (rev a2)
2012-06-06T19:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sl0w	ok, did you install the proprietary video driver?
2012-06-06T19:02:00.000Z	sl0w	ActionParsnip	i didn't do any additional installation of drivers
2012-06-06T19:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sl0w	ok run:  sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings
2012-06-06T19:03:00.000Z	sl0w	ActionParsnip	0 upgraded, 0 installed...
2012-06-06T19:05:00.000Z	sl0w	ActionParsnip	so it looks like the newest driver is installed. any other suggestions?
2012-06-06T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sl0w	its 12.04, not 12 ;)
2012-06-06T19:48:00.000Z	sl0w	ActionParsnip	sorry, 12.04 :P :)
2012-06-06T19:56:00.000Z	sl0w	ActionParsnip	 so this is interesting... when I installed disper, and ran the disper -l command, my external monitor is listed
2012-06-06T20:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sl0w	if you use nvidia-settings you can config the disaply there
2012-06-06T20:03:00.000Z	sl0w	ActionParsnip	yes, but how do I do that?
2012-06-06T20:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sl0w	press ALT+F2 and run the command...
2012-06-06T20:04:00.000Z	sl0w	ActionParsnip	hmmm
2012-06-06T20:11:00.000Z	sl0w	ActionParsnip	ok. so that works... but I still can't get my laptop to stop "suspending" whenever I close the lid. Even though i've changed the settings in the "Power" management settings
2012-06-06T20:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sl0w	i'm not great with suspend, not worth it imho
2012-06-06T20:12:00.000Z	sl0w	ActionParsnip	?
