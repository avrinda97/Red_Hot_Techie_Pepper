2008-06-08T15:11:00.000Z	Reenen		how do I get Amarok to not show the "splash" when it changes the song?
2008-06-08T15:13:00.000Z	bazhang	Reenen	settings configure amarok that one
2008-06-08T15:11:00.000Z	bazhang	Reenen	in the amarok prefs
2008-06-08T15:12:00.000Z	Reenen	bazhang	where do I get the prefs?  There isn't an obvious place on the menu
2008-08-02T17:36:00.000Z	bazhang	Reenen	did you right click remove safely or just yank it out
2008-08-02T17:37:00.000Z	Reenen	bazhang	I did right click, and say "unmount"
2008-08-02T17:37:00.000Z	bazhang	Reenen	and you waited until it was unmounted?
2008-08-02T17:37:00.000Z	Reenen	bazhang	but then it said it can't yet, and it showed that message for long (way longer than it should take to copy the files), so then I "yanked it out" as you say
2008-08-02T17:39:00.000Z	Reenen	bazhang	but before I yanked it out, I tried to access it via terminal, and via the "explorer", but in neither could I see the USB stick... so I assumed it was unmounted already
2008-08-02T17:40:00.000Z	bazhang	Reenen	seems some files were corrupted then; are they re-downloadable?
2008-08-02T17:41:00.000Z	Reenen	bazhang	 it is just that there is "garbage" files on the drive that I want to delete
2008-08-02T17:42:00.000Z	bazhang	Reenen	do you have permission issues with them? are they locked for instance?
2008-08-02T17:42:00.000Z	Reenen	bazhang	yes, it claims to be read-only, and some IO stuff too
2008-08-02T17:43:00.000Z	Reenen	bazhang	rm: cannot remove `%│6üj5æ¼.ÆB\\': Input/output error
2008-08-02T17:43:00.000Z	bazhang	Reenen	what about with sudo
2008-08-02T17:44:00.000Z	Reenen	bazhang	nope sudo still doesn't delete it
2008-08-02T18:00:00.000Z	Reenen	bazhang	can I just try fsck or similar stuff?
2008-08-02T18:00:00.000Z	bazhang	Reenen	you can try but if it is corrupted then likelihood of success is small
2008-08-02T18:01:00.000Z	Reenen	bazhang	any other tools that might help?
2008-08-02T18:02:00.000Z	bazhang	Reenen	you want to remove only those files or format disk
2008-08-02T18:02:00.000Z	Reenen	bazhang	I do not want to format the disk, because I've had a bad experience with a reformatting of a USB disk
2008-08-02T18:19:00.000Z	Reenen	bazhang	How do I know what device is the one I want if I want to try fsck?
