2005-07-16T09:11:00.000Z	dylan_		iPod directory structure must be present before synching to the iPod can be performed.
2005-07-16T09:12:00.000Z	selinium	dylan_	I think that you may need to install it via itunes on a windows machine before you will get the file structure.
2005-07-16T09:15:00.000Z	selinium	dylan_	THERE IS NO FILE STRUCTURE ON YOUR IPOD. The drive needs to be formatted. This is what gives your pod its name and structure. The pod does not konw it is Dylan's IPOD
2005-07-16T09:17:00.000Z	selinium	dylan_	I set up a pod for a friend a while ago, but in the set up it formats the ipods drive and gives it a file structure. Any PC will do.
2005-07-16T09:20:00.000Z	selinium	dylan_	let me konw how you get on! :)
2005-07-16T09:21:00.000Z	selinium	dylan_	with your pod
2005-07-16T09:24:00.000Z	selinium	dylan_	have you never used itunes to set up the drive then?
2005-07-16T09:24:00.000Z	selinium	dylan_	That is strange, Did you buy it second hand?
2005-07-16T09:26:00.000Z	selinium	dylan_	i don't know what else to say then. does winamp allow you to name your pod?
2005-07-16T09:31:00.000Z	selinium	dylan_	I can only go by what I saw when I installed ny friends ipod with itunes. It formatted the drive, maybe in a different way than out of the box. I can only suggest trying it with itunes and then gtkpog should work. Ask randykay what he did with his.
