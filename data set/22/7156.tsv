2006-05-27T15:07:00.000Z	jain		I need some help
2006-05-27T15:07:00.000Z	jain		I am having problems with hibernating and switch user
2006-05-27T15:07:00.000Z	jain		with fglrx
2006-05-27T15:08:00.000Z	jain		the screen doesnot resume
2006-05-27T15:08:00.000Z	jain		in hibernate case
2006-05-27T15:08:00.000Z	jain		and for switching user the computer just freezes when I try
2006-05-27T15:09:00.000Z	jain		Anyone?
2006-05-27T15:09:00.000Z	egad	jain	i could be wrong but i dont believe fglrx supports hibernating ??
2006-05-27T15:10:00.000Z	jain	egad	Is it so?
2006-05-27T15:10:00.000Z	jain		it worked in FC5 when i was using it
2006-05-27T15:10:00.000Z	jain		I can hibernate, problem with resuming at last step, it shows the mouse pointer
2006-05-27T15:10:00.000Z	jain		and then it hangs
2006-05-27T15:12:00.000Z	egad	jain	ati?
2006-05-27T15:13:00.000Z	jain	egad	with ati things are OK
2006-05-27T15:13:00.000Z	jain		but i wand 3D acceleration
2006-05-27T15:14:00.000Z	egad	jain	right.. the ati drivers support hibernating.. fglrx does not
2006-05-27T15:15:00.000Z	egad	jain	its a trade off.. either 3d support or hibernation support
2006-05-27T15:15:00.000Z	jain	egad	hmm, I was using fedora core 5 before, and it worked there. I thoght it would work in ubuntu too
2006-05-27T15:16:00.000Z	egad	jain	query the ubuntuforums.org site.. I recall seeing something about this on there recently..
2006-05-27T15:16:00.000Z	jain	egad	though fglrx was not working with previous version of fedora
2006-05-27T15:16:00.000Z	jain	egad	Okay
