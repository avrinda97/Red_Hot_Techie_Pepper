2008-12-31T04:51:00.000Z	Frijolie		how can you tell what application/process is running your sound in PulseAudio?
2008-12-31T04:52:00.000Z	Frijolie		I can't get sound in anything else because it says that sound is already running on another process

2009-02-05T09:41:00.000Z	nathanhelp	Frijolie	Thanks. But im thinking if they arent in the repos, that wont work.
2009-02-05T09:41:00.000Z	nathanhelp	Frijolie	& Flannel: i guess what im asking is more this... teach me how to work with source files so i can learn how to do it myself. are you able to do that with me?
2009-02-05T09:41:00.000Z	Frijolie	nathanhelp	yeah I saw after I typed that you're looking for the most up-to-date
2009-02-05T09:42:00.000Z	Frijolie	nathanhelp	if you install by source it won't auto update in the future
2009-02-05T09:49:00.000Z	Frijolie	nathanhelp	get your "buddies" to install pidgin! it's cross platform
2009-02-05T09:49:00.000Z	nathanhelp	Frijolie	I'm talking about me...upgrading to the latest version...using a source file.
2009-02-05T09:51:00.000Z	Frijolie	nathanhelp	compiling from source can be opening a can-o-worms sometimes
2009-02-05T09:51:00.000Z	Frijolie	nathanhelp	what they call "dependency hell"..i'm hesitant to recommend that
