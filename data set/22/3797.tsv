2008-08-08T06:10:00.000Z	EugenMayer		where do i get the linux-headers-2.6.26 with ubuntu or the ubuntu way
2008-08-08T06:10:00.000Z	wols	EugenMayer	same place you got the 2.6.26 kernel
2008-08-08T06:10:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	i got the kernel form kernel.org? >)
2008-08-08T06:11:00.000Z	wols	EugenMayer	then you should have used kernel-package to build and build headers too
2008-08-08T06:11:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	i just cant install the ATI drivers i build buy the howto, because i have no kernel headers (because i have a custom kernel...the current 2.6.26.2 from kernel.org)
2008-08-08T06:12:00.000Z	wols	EugenMayer	and since you have compiled your own kernel you have all needed files anyways
2008-08-08T06:12:00.000Z	wols	EugenMayer	if you make your own kernel you are on your own. either you know how to do it, or like in your case you don't.
2008-08-08T06:12:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	yeah, but i cant install the ATI drivers, it says that the dependencies are not fulfilled
2008-08-08T06:12:00.000Z	wols	EugenMayer	then use a ubuntu krenel if you cannot compile kernels properly
2008-08-08T06:13:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	i had to build my own kerlen because of the ipw3945 bugs in the current ubuntu kernel
2008-08-08T06:13:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	my kernel is compiled..
2008-08-08T06:13:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	and my kernel works.
2008-08-08T06:13:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	all i need is to get the prop. ati drivers working.
2008-08-08T06:16:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	my kernel works perfectly, all i do is following this guide http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Hardy_Installation_Guide to install the prop AI drivers. iam using the manual way, i could build the packages but when i install them, it fails because of missing headers (acutally i think this dep is just no needed in my case )
2008-08-08T06:17:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	one question, that kernel-package, is that one using the current kernel.org version?because yet i see only that one fixing the ipw3945 bugs complety
2008-08-08T06:21:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	the problem is, i could get the headers from kernel.org, but i would not be able to install them, that the deps are fulfilled
2008-08-08T06:22:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	yap, but i will need to tell that ubunut :) or the package manager or whatever it is called
2008-08-08T06:23:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	i build the ati driver packages for ubuntu that way:ati-driver-installer-8-7-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/hardy
2008-08-08T06:24:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	that works, when i install the packages (esp fglrx-kernel-source_*.deb fglrx-amdcccle_*.deb) i need dkms
2008-08-08T06:25:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	ok, once and for all. if i USE the kernel-package, i CANT use the kernel.org version, right?that means, my WLAN ipw2945 WONT work. So i CANT do it that WAY
2008-08-08T06:27:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	hmm, ok, then MasterShrek was just missleading me. Any docs how to use the kernel-package?
2008-08-08T06:28:00.000Z	EugenMayer	wols	thank you, iam on it
