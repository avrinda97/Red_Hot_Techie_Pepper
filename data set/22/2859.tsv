2009-05-17T20:40:00.000Z	indian_munnda		hi all can anyone tell me how can i set my color scheme to 32-bit currently it 16-bit. But my virtualbox wants it to be 32-bit. how to change that?
2009-05-17T20:41:00.000Z	mzz	indian_munnda	editing it in xorg.conf may be the way to go, although I'm a bit surprised by it defaulting to 16
2009-05-17T20:41:00.000Z	indian_munnda	mzz	wat to do there
2009-05-17T20:41:00.000Z	mzz	indian_munnda	there should be a DefaultDepth in there somewhere, change that to 32. If there's no DefaultDepth I'd like to see your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2009-05-17T20:42:00.000Z	indian_munnda	mzz	dude there is nothing called defaultDepth
2009-05-17T20:46:00.000Z	indian_munnda	mzz	dude there is nothing called defaultDepth
2009-05-17T20:47:00.000Z	mzz	indian_munnda	as I said: if there's no DefaultDepth please pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2009-05-17T20:49:00.000Z	indian_munnda	mzz	here is the xorg.0.log http://paste.ubuntu.com/174381/

2009-05-17T20:52:00.000Z	mzz	indian_munnda	yeah, I saw. Sorry, I'm behind pretty laggy ssh right now. Reading as soon as I've managed to load it :)
2009-05-17T20:52:00.000Z	indian_munnda	mzz	ok dude
2009-05-17T20:55:00.000Z	indian_munnda	mzz	got any thing dude?
2009-05-17T20:57:00.000Z	mzz	indian_munnda	sorry, looking now. This connection is atrocious (I'm uploading data through ssh, lag of a second or so, and no usable local browser)
2009-05-17T20:58:00.000Z	indian_munnda	mzz	ok thanx
2009-05-17T20:59:00.000Z	mzz	indian_munnda	"Depth 24, framebuffer bpp 32". What was the exact error from VirtualBox?
2009-05-17T21:00:00.000Z	indian_munnda	mzz	it says the guest OS can only run in 32-bit color scheme
2009-05-17T21:00:00.000Z	mzz	indian_munnda	I think you need to reconfigure the guest, not the host. The host is ubuntu?
2009-05-17T21:01:00.000Z	indian_munnda	mzz	how to do that?
2009-05-17T21:03:00.000Z	mzz	indian_munnda	the host is ubuntu, right? According to Xorg.0.log it is running in 24 bit color, which makes sense. What's the guest? Can it be reconfigured to run in 24 (or 32) bit color too?
2009-05-17T21:04:00.000Z	indian_munnda	mzz	i have installed BACKTRACK3 in the virtual box as a guest OS.
2009-05-17T21:05:00.000Z	mzz	indian_munnda	I don't know how to reconfgure that one.
2009-05-17T21:05:00.000Z	indian_munnda	mzz	ok me trying dude
