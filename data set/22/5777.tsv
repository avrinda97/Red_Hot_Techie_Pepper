2007-03-17T07:36:00.000Z	nevermind		does anyone handle different encodings here?

2007-03-17T07:37:00.000Z	nevermind		!charset
2007-03-17T07:37:00.000Z	nevermind		oO
2007-03-17T07:38:00.000Z	crdlb	nevermind	what exactly are you trying to find out?
2007-03-17T07:38:00.000Z	nevermind	crdlb	i'm on this IRC channel where they complain that i'm using UTF-8 and the # uses iso
2007-03-17T07:39:00.000Z	nevermind	crdlb	but i've changed my encoding and it's still the same
2007-03-17T07:39:00.000Z	crdlb	nevermind	what irc client are you using?
2007-03-17T07:40:00.000Z	nevermind	crdlb	xChat
2007-03-17T07:40:00.000Z	nevermind	crdlb	i understand it uses iconv, but i've been trying to convert from utf-8 to iso without success
2007-03-17T07:41:00.000Z	nevermind	crdlb	and i don't want to change my whole system encoding just for a single #
2007-03-17T07:43:00.000Z	crdlb	nevermind	who's complaining? my xchat is set to utf-8 too
2007-03-17T07:43:00.000Z	nevermind	crdlb	it's a LUG channel
2007-03-17T07:43:00.000Z	nevermind	crdlb	they use ISO-8859-1
2007-03-17T07:44:00.000Z	nevermind	crdlb	but when i set my xChat to that, the conversion has no effect
2007-03-17T07:44:00.000Z	crdlb	nevermind	you can set it on a per-server basis in the properties window of the network list
2007-03-17T07:45:00.000Z	crdlb	nevermind	is that what you're doing?
2007-03-17T07:45:00.000Z	nevermind	crdlb	right, but it doesn't 'translate'
2007-03-17T07:46:00.000Z	crdlb	nevermind	you sure you set the encoding for the right irc network?
2007-03-17T07:46:00.000Z	crdlb	nevermind	which lug is it?
2007-03-17T07:46:00.000Z	nevermind	crdlb	yes, the thing is that if you try the same in a terminal, iconv doesn't translate either (ie: echo "" (alt+160) | iconv -t iso-8859-1)
2007-03-17T07:47:00.000Z	nevermind	crdlb	not listed, they say it's secret :P
