2005-10-07T08:24:00.000Z	Ofe		Would anyone know how to set 56000bps a-link external voice-faxmodem with a conexant chipset from 9600bps to 56000bps? It doesn't say anywhere that it's 9600bps. But firefox dowloads maximum of 900bytes/s and synaptic too. anyone, help?
2005-10-07T08:26:00.000Z	stpere	Ofe	go to /etc/ppp/peers
2005-10-07T08:26:00.000Z	stpere	Ofe	look for the file describing your connexion
2005-10-07T08:26:00.000Z	stpere		connection*
2005-10-07T08:26:00.000Z	stpere	Ofe	it's probably ppp0
2005-10-07T08:26:00.000Z	stpere	Ofe	edit it as root
2005-10-07T08:27:00.000Z	Ofe	stpere	: it's ppp0. I tried pppconfig before and it didn't help.
2005-10-07T08:27:00.000Z	stpere	Ofe	add the line 115200
2005-10-07T08:28:00.000Z	Ofe	stpere	"bash: /etc/ppp/peers: is a directory" what command should I use? I'm a newbie with linux. :)

2005-10-07T08:29:00.000Z	stpere	Ofe	add 115200 on a line alone
2005-10-07T08:30:00.000Z	Ofe	stpere	to the last line? no matter where?
2005-10-07T08:30:00.000Z	stpere	Ofe	no matter where
2005-10-07T08:30:00.000Z	Ofe	stpere	ok, did that. do I have to save somewhere or make it apply?

2005-10-07T08:31:00.000Z	stpere	Ofe	hangup your connection
2005-10-07T08:31:00.000Z	stpere	Ofe	then dialup again
