2005-05-01T08:21:00.000Z	nubbe	Burgundavia	ok, I got hoary, security and marillat repositories, is that enough to get backports?
2005-05-01T08:21:00.000Z	Burgundavia	nubbe	the backporting is patch based, not a backported package. You will get it through the normal security process
2005-05-01T08:22:00.000Z	nubbe	Burgundavia	great thanks, another question, i haven't got a single update since hoary was final, I hope that's as it should be?
2005-05-01T08:23:00.000Z	Burgundavia	nubbe	yes
2005-05-01T08:23:00.000Z	Burgundavia	nubbe	there have been no security advisories save the ff ones, which ar a beast to do, from what i understand
2005-05-01T08:24:00.000Z	nubbe	Burgundavia	okidoki, I  guess the devs and/or packageers could use a break now...
2005-05-01T08:26:00.000Z	Burgundavia	nubbe	yes
2005-05-01T08:26:00.000Z	Burgundavia	nubbe	but don't switch yet, breezy is mostly just a sync for sid, and is very unstable
2005-05-01T08:28:00.000Z	nubbe	Burgundavia	I won't switch for a good while, but I'd like to keep track of some stuff, things like updated w32codecs and other instaleld stuff
2005-05-01T08:28:00.000Z	Burgundavia	nubbe	breezy will be pretty stable by mid-may I imagine. They are building breezy with gcc 4.0, so that is the major breakage right now
2005-05-01T08:29:00.000Z	nubbe	Burgundavia	is there any good way to know when updates r available?
2005-05-01T08:29:00.000Z	Burgundavia	nubbe	for what?
2005-05-01T08:30:00.000Z	Burgundavia	nubbe	if you switch to breezy, you swithc lock,stock and barrel
2005-05-01T08:30:00.000Z	nubbe	Burgundavia	so if an x-chat update is available I will now?
2005-05-01T08:31:00.000Z	nubbe	Burgundavia	without switching to Breezy?
2005-05-01T08:31:00.000Z	Burgundavia	nubbe	if any update is available for any package in your system, a little red circle will appear in the top right
2005-05-01T08:31:00.000Z	nubbe	Burgundavia	thanks, just what I wanted to know
2005-05-01T08:32:00.000Z	nubbe	Burgundavia	But update manager will show if any installed packages have updates?
2005-05-01T08:33:00.000Z	Burgundavia	nubbe	yep
2005-05-01T08:33:00.000Z	Burgundavia	nubbe	such is the wonders of apt
2005-05-01T08:33:00.000Z	nubbe	Burgundavia	goody  :)
2005-05-01T08:34:00.000Z	nubbe	Burgundavia	I was a little afraid that it would "protect" me from updates outside of Hoary  :)
