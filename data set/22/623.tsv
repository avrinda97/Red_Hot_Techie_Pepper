2011-06-22T09:00:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dlong	this is a switch, not a hub, right?
2011-06-22T09:00:00.000Z	dlong	Seven_Six_Two	yes
2011-06-22T09:00:00.000Z	dlong	Seven_Six_Two	it is a switch
2011-06-22T09:01:00.000Z	dlong	Seven_Six_Two	I tried just using crossover cable, that didn't work either.  So I thought that putting the switch in the middle would help
2011-06-22T09:02:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dlong	I've used a crossover successfully. can I see your /etc/network/interfaces
2011-06-22T09:03:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dlong	and the output of ifconfig
2011-06-22T09:04:00.000Z	dlong	Seven_Six_Two	/etc/network/interfaces is not being used because of networkmanager

2011-06-22T09:08:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dlong	now how about the output of route
2011-06-22T09:11:00.000Z	dlong	Seven_Six_Two	http://pastebin.com/TpxstaSV  -  You will notice some routes for my wireless and my VPN, but they are fine and I don't think they should be affecting my eth0
2011-06-22T09:13:00.000Z	dlong	Seven_Six_Two	route for other box: http://pastebin.com/Bhtapmg7
2011-06-22T09:16:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dlong	what kind of switch do you have? is anything else plugged in?
2011-06-22T09:17:00.000Z	dlong	Seven_Six_Two	nothing else plugged in...just a linksys SLM2008 8 port switch
2011-06-22T09:20:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dlong	is there any config required for that switch?
2011-06-22T09:22:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dlong	I don't know about that. I know some switches can detect...
2011-06-22T09:22:00.000Z	dlong	Seven_Six_Two	possibly.  That is why I tried using the crossover cable first.  Tried regular cable too, because my understanding is that you don't have to have crossover cable for most modern nic cards
2011-06-22T09:24:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	dlong	that switch defaults to 192.168.1.254
2011-06-22T09:25:00.000Z	dlong	Seven_Six_Two	I will take a look at the switch.  Thanks for your help
