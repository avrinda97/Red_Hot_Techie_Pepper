2007-10-27T22:18:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		Anyone know why the gnome settings daemon won't load on startup?
2007-10-27T22:19:00.000Z	timbobsteve	Flynsarmy	.... what is the error message you get?
2007-10-27T22:19:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	timbobsteve	Did not receive a reply.
2007-10-27T22:20:00.000Z	timbobsteve	Flynsarmy	.... hmmm have you modified any groups or users using the gnome-user-config tool? (in the administration menu)
2007-10-27T22:21:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	timbobsteve	It's a fresh install of Gutsy. Strange considering last time i installed it it worked fine
2007-10-27T22:22:00.000Z	timbobsteve	Flynsarmy	.... what if you run gnome-settings-daemon from a terminal?
2007-10-27T22:22:00.000Z	timbobsteve	Flynsarmy	any errors? or perhaps errors listed in syslog?
2007-10-27T22:23:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	timbobsteve	wow that got it. Why won't it load on startup? I also get error popups saying it won't load when i try to open certain windows like appearance in preferences
2007-10-27T22:24:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	timbobsteve	Also when running from terminal at the end it says 'Warning: failed to register with the message bus'
2007-10-27T22:25:00.000Z	timbobsteve	Flynsarmy	check that dbus is running... if it isn't try starting it with "/etc/init.d/dbus start"
2007-10-27T22:25:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	timbobsteve	How do i find out if it's running?
2007-10-27T22:26:00.000Z	timbobsteve	Flynsarmy	 "ps aux | grep dbus |grep -f grep".... if there is a listing in the output then it is running.... restart it anyway (replace start with restart)
2007-10-27T22:32:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	timbobsteve	OK it's restarted. It didn't automatically load gnome settings daemon though
2007-10-27T22:32:00.000Z	timbobsteve	Flynsarmy	no.... it shouldn't anyway..... ok now try starting gnome-settings-daemon from a terminal....
2007-10-27T22:32:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	timbobsteve	OK it did a bunch of stuff. didn't automatically start gnome settings daemon though
2007-10-27T22:35:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	timbobsteve	Same warning
2007-10-27T22:35:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	timbobsteve	Sorry there are warnings i didn't see. failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus
2007-10-27T22:35:00.000Z	timbobsteve	Flynsarmy	.... i forgot the exact error msg... can you type it again for me ? :P
2007-10-27T22:35:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	timbobsteve	conneciton refused
2007-10-27T22:39:00.000Z	timbobsteve	Flynsarmy	try this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3605549
2007-10-27T22:39:00.000Z	timbobsteve	Flynsarmy	my next best guess s to google it.... sry I am all out of ideas... I thought it may have been the same problem as Balma was having... but it isn't... check the gnome boards
2007-10-27T22:40:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	timbobsteve	ok, thanks
