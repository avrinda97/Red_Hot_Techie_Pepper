2007-09-20T12:35:00.000Z	finferflu		hello
2007-09-20T12:36:00.000Z	finferflu		a friend of mine just installed ubuntu, and was doing cut & paste from an usb flash card
2007-09-20T12:36:00.000Z	finferflu		but she can't paste anything
2007-09-20T12:36:00.000Z	finferflu		and there's nothing left on the usb card
2007-09-20T12:36:00.000Z	finferflu		is there any way to retrieve the files?
2007-09-20T12:37:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	finferflu	can she past the files back on the USB disk?
2007-09-20T12:40:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	finferflu	this *might* work
2007-09-20T12:40:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	finferflu	is the USB disk formatted as fat16?
2007-09-20T12:41:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	finferflu	maybe there is an undelete utility for fat filesystems. Let me see
2007-09-20T12:42:00.000Z	finferflu	CaptainFrisbee	thanks, it's is vfat, but I don't know whether it's 16 or 32
2007-09-20T12:45:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	finferflu	are any of the files listed on /tmp ?
2007-09-20T12:45:00.000Z	finferflu	CaptainFrisbee	it doesn't look so
2007-09-20T12:47:00.000Z	finferflu	CaptainFrisbee	most of them are socket files... nothing more
2007-09-20T12:47:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	finferflu	You could try magicrescue: http://jbj.rapanden.dk/magicrescue/ it's in the repo's
2007-09-20T12:48:00.000Z	finferflu	CaptainFrisbee	I will give a look
2007-09-20T12:48:00.000Z	finferflu	CaptainFrisbee	Thanks :)
2007-09-20T13:03:00.000Z	finferflu	CaptainFrisbee	I couldn't rescue any file with magicrescue
2007-09-20T13:05:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	finferflu	did you use the correct 'recipe' with magicrescue?
2007-09-20T13:41:00.000Z	finferflu	CaptainFrisbee	I have managed to rescue the files, there was a bug in magicrescue: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-bugs/2007-March/445433.html
2007-09-20T13:41:00.000Z	finferflu	CaptainFrisbee	wrong dependencies
2007-09-20T13:41:00.000Z	finferflu	CaptainFrisbee	thanks for your help, you made my and my friend's day :)
2007-09-20T13:42:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	finferflu	thx glad that you could restore the files!
