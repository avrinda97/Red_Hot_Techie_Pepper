2008-02-29T04:44:00.000Z	daef	Aghachi	backslashes are evil... windows uses backslashes... windows is evil.... use linux - you will get rid of c:\ d:\ and so on...
2008-02-29T04:46:00.000Z	daef	Aghachi	format the drives via linux..
2008-02-29T04:46:00.000Z	daef	Aghachi	where is the prob?
2008-02-29T04:48:00.000Z	daef	Aghachi	but formatting a device the installer cannot find will not force the find-progress
2008-02-29T04:48:00.000Z	daef	Aghachi	the problem is something else!!
2008-02-29T04:48:00.000Z	daef	Aghachi	that is the question you should ask...
