2005-12-15T06:25:00.000Z	mmiikkee12		takes too long...
2005-12-15T06:25:00.000Z	mmiikkee12		waste of bandwidth
2005-12-15T06:25:00.000Z	djm62	mmiikkee12	since apt handles the dependencies, why not install metacity and gnome-panel
2005-12-15T06:26:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	djm62	best answer out of all of them, thanks :)
2005-12-15T07:19:00.000Z	djm62	mmiikkee12	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
2005-12-15T07:26:00.000Z	djm62	mmiikkee12	gnome has to use something to display
2005-12-15T07:28:00.000Z	djm62	mmiikkee12	the choice that you find really useful is pretty intimidating to someone that associates gnomes with vintage computer games
2005-12-15T07:31:00.000Z	djm62	mmiikkee12	too much choice...advanced users can trim down an install or start from a server install
2005-12-15T07:32:00.000Z	djm62	mmiikkee12	absolute beginners can't fix bad decisions they accidentally make at the start, and go on to give bad publicity to ubuntu forever
2005-12-15T07:32:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	djm62	good point...
2005-12-15T07:32:00.000Z	djm62	mmiikkee12	windows users blame themselves, because the machine was set up when they got it ;)
2005-12-15T07:35:00.000Z	djm62	mmiikkee12	if you need gnome, install gnome-panel and metacity: it won't install anything extraneous
2005-12-15T07:35:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	djm62	that's what i did and it left out X :S
2005-12-15T07:36:00.000Z	djm62	mmiikkee12	really?
2005-12-15T07:37:00.000Z	djm62	mmiikkee12	frugaller and frugaller...you don't technically need X on /that/ machine to run gnome ;)
2005-12-15T07:37:00.000Z	djm62	mmiikkee12	I think xserver-xorg will bring in the right x stuff
2005-12-15T07:38:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	djm62	missed fixed font
2005-12-15T07:39:00.000Z	djm62	mmiikkee12	xorg-common, xserver-xorg
2005-12-15T07:39:00.000Z	djm62	mmiikkee12	all about the metapackages, even on this
2005-12-15T07:39:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	djm62	i got it...
