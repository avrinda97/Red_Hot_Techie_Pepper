2009-01-17T08:18:00.000Z	CoUrPsE|DeAd	raz0o0x	You can ask everyone, State your question.
2009-01-17T08:23:00.000Z	CoUrPsE|DeAd	raz0o0x	To make it easier on people trying t o help you, could you please not use enter as puncuiation.
2009-01-17T08:19:00.000Z	CoUrPsE|DeAd	raz0o0x	the folder still stays there unless you delete it.
2009-01-17T08:20:00.000Z	CoUrPsE|DeAd	raz0o0x	You would of had to mkdir the folder in the first place.
2009-01-17T08:21:00.000Z	CoUrPsE|DeAd	raz0o0x	then rm -r /media/zero
2009-01-17T08:24:00.000Z	CoUrPsE|DeAd	raz0o0x	try: set -u MANPATH
2009-01-17T08:24:00.000Z	raz0o0x	CoUrPsE|DeAd	that does not work
2009-01-17T08:31:00.000Z	CoUrPsE|DeAd	raz0o0x	You COULD try sudo apt-get --reinstall install man
2009-01-17T08:44:00.000Z	raz0o0x	CoUrPsE|DeAd	typing ï»¿env --unset=MANPATH does not work. When I echo $MANPATH it remains set to "/home/eyurtsev/root_518/man". Whenever I load a new terminal, that's the default value it gets.
2009-01-17T08:47:00.000Z	raz0o0x	CoUrPsE|DeAd	 what should I set it to?
2009-01-17T08:47:00.000Z	raz0o0x	CoUrPsE|DeAd	I just began using linux, so I'm not really sure what the default values should be
2009-01-17T08:47:00.000Z	CoUrPsE|DeAd	raz0o0x	Looking at my env, there is no default variable for MANPATH.
2009-01-17T08:47:00.000Z	CoUrPsE|DeAd	raz0o0x	type env
2009-01-17T08:49:00.000Z	raz0o0x	CoUrPsE|DeAd	yes. "MANPATH=/home/eyurtsev/root_518/man" However, there's a whole bunch of other programs also set to /home/eyurtsev/root_518. For example, "PYTHONPATH=/home/eyurtsev/root_518/lib"
2009-01-17T08:50:00.000Z	raz0o0x	CoUrPsE|DeAd	This happened after a guy edited some script on my computer, so that I can load the ROOT518 system by typing "root" from any folder in the desktop
2009-01-17T08:50:00.000Z	raz0o0x	CoUrPsE|DeAd	I mean from any folder in the terminal
2009-01-17T08:50:00.000Z	CoUrPsE|DeAd	raz0o0x	Hummm.
2009-01-17T08:51:00.000Z	raz0o0x	CoUrPsE|DeAd	 OK :) Thanks for the help anyway!
2009-01-17T08:51:00.000Z	raz0o0x	CoUrPsE|DeAd	Yes. I use it all the time. It's an analysis package for high energy physics
2009-01-17T08:53:00.000Z	raz0o0x	CoUrPsE|DeAd	 they are not working until I do "unset MANPATH" each time I load a new terminal. after I do that they work. It's just annoying and I thought there was a simple way to diagnose where this variable was being set
2009-01-17T08:55:00.000Z	raz0o0x	CoUrPsE|DeAd	OK. Thanks! I'm off to sleep this is not worth the trouble right now.
