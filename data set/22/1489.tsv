2010-10-02T14:50:00.000Z	mxe5		Is there another hard drive app besides Disk Usage Analyzer that would be a good one to use ? ?
2010-10-02T14:51:00.000Z	icarus-c	mxe5	what sort of tool you want
2010-10-02T14:51:00.000Z	mxe5		Running 10.4
2010-10-02T14:52:00.000Z	mxe5	icarus-c	Something that would be a nice GUI that would give me a more detailed output.
2010-10-02T14:52:00.000Z	icarus-c	mxe5	what sort of information?  like  usage analysis ?
2010-10-02T14:52:00.000Z	mxe5	icarus-c	Yup
2010-10-02T14:53:00.000Z	icarus-c	mxe5	SMART data? disk properties?...etc
2010-10-02T14:53:00.000Z	mxe5	icarus-c	Any of those would be ok.
2010-10-02T14:54:00.000Z	mxe5	icarus-c	Disk properties, how much soace is left, what files are taking more room, etc. etc.
2010-10-02T14:54:00.000Z	icarus-c	mxe5	gnome disk usage analysis is pretty decent already.  and for disk properties you could try palimpsest
2010-10-02T14:55:00.000Z	mxe5	icarus-c	Opps I meant "space"
2010-10-02T14:56:00.000Z	icarus-c	mxe5	doesn't gnome disk usage analysis do the task?
2010-10-02T14:56:00.000Z	mxe5	icarus-c	How about something that would give you report of the health or a type of disk chk?
2010-10-02T14:56:00.000Z	icarus-c	mxe5	that's about SMART data.  palimpsest does that
2010-10-02T14:56:00.000Z	icarus-c	mxe5	gsmartcontrol also
2010-10-02T14:57:00.000Z	mxe5	icarus-c	Cool - Thanks much Will take a look see....
2010-10-02T14:57:00.000Z	icarus-c	mxe5	oops palimpsest doesn't do smart :P
2010-10-02T14:57:00.000Z	mxe5	icarus-c	ok
2010-10-02T14:58:00.000Z	icarus-c	mxe5	and for disk partitioning/file system, you could use gparted
2010-10-02T14:59:00.000Z	mxe5	icarus-c	Yea actually had forgotten how great that app is - looked at it 8/9 months ago and had forgotten about it.
2010-10-02T15:04:00.000Z	mxe5	icarus-c	Just did a "hard drive" search in "Ubuntu Software Center" and found "GSmartControl" that looks promising.
2010-10-02T15:06:00.000Z	mxe5	icarus-c	Also "Graphical Disk Map" Thanks for input.
