2006-08-31T07:48:00.000Z	chris__	nozorro	I have lost 'places' icon from panel, tried to add it to panel but not possible
2006-08-31T07:49:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	how do you mean, could you describe in more detail pls?
2006-08-31T07:51:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	oh. only the 'places' menu, or also 'applications', 'system'?
2006-08-31T07:53:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	if you lost all of thos menus, you can re-add them without problem
2006-08-31T07:53:00.000Z	chris__	nozorro	how do I add them?
2006-08-31T07:54:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	step by step: right-click on the panel ...
2006-08-31T07:54:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	then select 'Add to panel'
2006-08-31T07:54:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	finally select Menu Bar
2006-08-31T07:55:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	first off, in order not to lose the menu again, do the following:
2006-08-31T07:56:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	how did it happen? did you do anything special?
2006-08-31T07:58:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	ah ..., well other than deinstalling it (it's beta software) i can't help you because ...
2006-08-31T08:01:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	might be possible, but nothing that i know right know. another workaround would be to create a new user account (after deinstalling beagle) and then work from there
2006-08-31T08:02:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	wait! big hassel ahead!
2006-08-31T08:03:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	another option is occurring to me ...
2006-08-31T08:03:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	you could reinstall gnome-panel with one command, just let me search the command ...
2006-08-31T08:03:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	wait a sec
2006-08-31T08:05:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	do a sudo 'apt-get --reinstall install gnome-panel', but pls try to deinstall beagle and any other non-standard stuff you think might interfere
2006-08-31T08:06:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	'apt-get --reinstall install gnome-panel' , to be more correct ... and wait a bit more
2006-08-31T08:07:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	to be on the safe side, do the same reinstall for the package gnome-panel-data
2006-08-31T08:22:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	were you able to fix it?
2006-08-31T08:25:00.000Z	nozorro	chris__	good luck
