2005-05-21T11:47:00.000Z	kestas		am I wrong in saying that ubuntu is debian with shorter release cycles?
2005-05-21T11:47:00.000Z	goofrider	kestas	Ubuntu is Debian with a **realisitic** release cycle, and a desktop focus
2005-05-21T11:50:00.000Z	goofrider	kestas	the company is Canonical
2005-05-21T11:50:00.000Z	goofrider	kestas	right now, it just seems Mike Shuttleworth has too much $$ and want to benefit the world
2005-05-21T11:51:00.000Z	goofrider	kestas	Cononical plans to build a support ecosystem selling support to other companies
2005-05-21T11:52:00.000Z	goofrider	kestas	Mark Suttleworth used to be a Debian developer as well
2005-05-21T11:52:00.000Z	goofrider	kestas	Cononical plans to provide support to companies like Red Hat
2005-05-21T11:53:00.000Z	goofrider	kestas	u should read the Mark Shuttleworth interview on Slashdot
2005-05-21T11:53:00.000Z	goofrider	kestas	no, Canonical will provide support for VAR who sells Ubuntu
2005-05-21T12:15:00.000Z	goofrider	kestas	why doesn't it matter why anyone wants to use one?
2005-05-21T12:22:00.000Z	goofrider	kestas	Linux for XBox is based on Debian, in fact
2005-05-21T12:27:00.000Z	kestas	goofrider	isn't always? it's practically never the best thing to do
2005-05-21T12:32:00.000Z	goofrider	kestas	no, u can only run the same kernel with Xen and Vserver
2005-05-21T12:33:00.000Z	goofrider	kestas	u can customzie your kernel in Ubuntu as well. U just recommented to use make-kpkg to make a DEB out of your custom kernel
2005-05-21T12:34:00.000Z	goofrider	kestas	please check the kernel docs
2005-05-21T12:35:00.000Z	goofrider	kestas	frankly i think Debian/Ubuntu ways of handling custom kernels is superb
2005-05-21T12:36:00.000Z	goofrider	kestas	I built custom kernel the DEbian way once like 2-3 years ago
