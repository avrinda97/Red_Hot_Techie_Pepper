2007-03-19T12:17:00.000Z	Joshoo1	cwillu	It froze as soon as I opened the terminal to try and edit fstab
2007-03-19T12:17:00.000Z	Joshoo1	cwillu	Then it tries to mount swap and something else and it froze again after that, and couldn't get online
2007-03-19T12:17:00.000Z	cwillu	Joshoo1	it kinda sounds like you might have more serious issues
2007-03-19T12:17:00.000Z	Joshoo1	cwillu	I'm not sure why it's working now
2007-03-19T12:18:00.000Z	Joshoo1	cwillu	Yeah, well it started when i messed with the partitioning though
2007-03-19T12:18:00.000Z	cwillu	Joshoo1	did the whole machine freeze, or just gedit?
2007-03-19T12:18:00.000Z	Joshoo1	cwillu	Everything, and sometimes it freezes on load, sometimes in login, sometimes just whenever, first when i opened terminal, then when I opened firefox to check internet, wh ich was dead
2007-03-19T12:19:00.000Z	cwillu	Joshoo1	:/
2007-03-19T12:19:00.000Z	Joshoo1	cwillu	Yeah, can't move mouse, hit keys, do anything, even turn on and off scroll lock or caps
2007-03-19T12:19:00.000Z	cwillu	Joshoo1	you have another computer nearby to that?
2007-03-19T12:19:00.000Z	Joshoo1	cwillu	No
2007-03-19T12:19:00.000Z	Joshoo1	cwillu	Only other computer I have are not mine, windows, and no IRC
2007-03-19T12:21:00.000Z	Joshoo1	cwillu	What should I add to fstab, it's working now
2007-03-19T12:22:00.000Z	Joshoo1	cwillu	No, just whenever it freezes, as usually I don't have to do anything
2007-03-19T12:22:00.000Z	Joshoo1	cwillu	This is a record right here, over 3 minutes, woo
