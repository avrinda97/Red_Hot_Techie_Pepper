2006-11-02T17:29:00.000Z	nothlit		Hi, can someone tell me why I get Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap", after I've installed gtk-engines-pixmap and restarted X ?
2006-11-02T10:55:00.000Z	Hoagie	nothlit	Thanks a bundle, you've been a great help :) I'll try that now.
2006-11-02T10:56:00.000Z	Hoagie	nothlit	Have a good 'un.
2006-11-02T11:10:00.000Z	Hoagie	nothlit	Sorry to keep asking you, but, I tried pressing a key, with no luck...
2006-11-02T11:12:00.000Z	nothlit	Hoagie	sorry then i wouldn't know, the only reason that xp would boot is if booting from the cd completely failed
2006-11-02T11:12:00.000Z	nothlit	Hoagie	there isn't usually a wait of 30 seconds if you boot to xp is there?
2006-11-02T11:13:00.000Z	Hoagie	nothlit	Nope, it normally skips right past the CD part. With the live CD in, it sits there spinning for a bit, then goes to xP
2006-11-02T11:14:00.000Z	Hoagie	nothlit	It also skips past it with a non-bootable CD in there
2006-11-02T11:15:00.000Z	nothlit	Hoagie	have you tried updating your bios firmware?
2006-11-02T11:17:00.000Z	Hoagie	nothlit	Uhh. *Looks baffled* I'm not that advanced... And I don't wanna go through that much trouble, as I wouldn't actually be installing ubuntu on this machine anyway ;)
2006-11-02T11:24:00.000Z	nothlit	Hoagie	well if you go into the bios menu it should tell you the number and the manufacturer hopefully. you go to your motherboard manufacturer's website and check the latest bios, and use their utilities to update it if necessary
2006-11-02T11:28:00.000Z	Hoagie	nothlit	I'd rather not try anything like that, is it's not actually my computer I'm testing the CD on. He gave me enough of a hairy eyeball when I described what the CD would (Or.. should...) do :P
2006-11-02T11:31:00.000Z	nothlit	Hoagie	loool i see
2006-11-02T11:32:00.000Z	nothlit	Hoagie	so why did you bring an armada of livecds to use?
2006-11-02T11:33:00.000Z	Hoagie	nothlit	Well, I ordered lots, because... They were free... I tried the one, and when that failed, I got reinforcements >_>
2006-11-02T11:35:00.000Z	nothlit	Hoagie	just remember that those cds are needed to help other people that wouldn't otherwise have access to foss get it
2006-11-02T11:37:00.000Z	Hoagie	nothlit	Yeah, I know. Loads of my friends are interested, but not sure about it. Was planning on passing them around
2006-11-02T11:37:00.000Z	nothlit	Hoagie	ahh ok :)
2006-11-02T11:38:00.000Z	Hoagie	nothlit	Sorry if it seems like I've been wasting your time :) I really appreciate the help, I just don't wanna risk blowing this PC to smithereens >_>
2006-11-02T11:38:00.000Z	nothlit	Hoagie	lol no not wasting anyones time
2006-11-02T11:39:00.000Z	nothlit	Hoagie	thats the purpose of this channel lol, to help
2006-11-02T11:39:00.000Z	nothlit	Hoagie	you can always ask on ##linux
