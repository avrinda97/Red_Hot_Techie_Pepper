2010-07-18T16:16:00.000Z	metalgeek		ok, another question, under windows when i uninstall a prog sometimes i have to go to other places to delete remenants of the prog, dose ubuntu have the same problem, if not, why?
2010-07-18T16:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	metalgeek	 apt package manager system = reason why its not really a problem.
2010-07-18T16:17:00.000Z	metalgeek	Dr_Willis	Thanks, What about third party apps
2010-07-18T16:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	metalgeek	 if they use the package manager system.. no issue..
2010-07-18T16:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	metalgeek	 thisis one of the MANY reasons linux people tend to hate 'self installing exwecutables' that are so common in windows.
2010-07-18T16:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	metalgeek	 when in doubt use  the .deb packages for anything you want to use.
2010-07-18T16:19:00.000Z	metalgeek	Dr_Willis	makes sense, What about defragging?
2010-07-18T16:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	metalgeek	 normally never needed
2010-07-19T04:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	metalgeek	 system files? gksudo gedit /path/to/whatever
2010-07-22T05:25:00.000Z	metalgeek	Dr_Willis	Hi, Would you know anything about ubuntu's theme engines, its all gotten abit confusing, Some themes that i download work fine, others complain about engines and some seem to have replaced all my icons with question marks, Would really appreciate any time spent on kicking me into touvh
2010-07-22T05:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	metalgeek	 to be honest with you - i just learned how stuff works over the years. and theres a lot of broken/bad theme parts out there on the different web sites.
2010-07-22T05:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	metalgeek	 and with the changes to gnome comming in the future.. i wonder if worrying about themes. is that  worthwhile. :)
2010-07-22T05:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	metalgeek	 i tend to use the gnome-art tool to install a few themes i like. and theres some ppas and themes in the repos i also use.
2010-07-23T05:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	metalgeek	 try moving the hidden files/dirs.. not deleting them :0 to some backup dir.
2010-07-23T05:05:00.000Z	metalgeek	Dr_Willis	always a pleasure DR, thanks for the assist
2010-07-23T05:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	metalgeek	 its worth learning what all those 'hidden and other special' dirs do. :) and dont touch the .gvfs dir either
2010-07-25T05:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	metalgeek	 in theory. You rerun 'sudo update-grub' and it 'should' see and add a proper grub menu item for windows - reguardless of what hard drive windows is instgalled on.
2010-07-25T05:49:00.000Z	metalgeek	Dr_Willis	Thanks
2010-07-25T05:50:00.000Z	metalgeek	Dr_Willis	Beautiful, worked like a charm cheers bye
