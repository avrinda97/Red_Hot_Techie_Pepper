2008-10-19T21:29:00.000Z	G__81		i need to compile Nvidia and i need the kernel headers

2008-10-19T21:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	G__81	sudo apt-get install ï»¿linux-headers-<kernel number>
2009-02-01T19:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	G__81	install fluxbox or xfce, its even lighter
2009-02-01T19:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	G__81	extract the files from both and examine is all i can suggest
2010-05-09T23:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	G__81	sudo nvidia-xconfig ,can help. It will make you an xorg.conf file with refresh rates which may be stopping the driver loading
2010-05-09T23:24:00.000Z	G__81	ActionParsnip	the nvidia driver is working but the problem is that i am getting only a 1280 * 800 config instead of 1280 * 1024 resolution
2010-05-09T23:24:00.000Z	G__81	ActionParsnip	i have tried all possible cases but i don't see 1280 * 1024 @ all
2010-05-09T23:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	G__81	you will need to reboot or restart x for the setting to happen
2010-05-09T23:24:00.000Z	G__81	ActionParsnip	i have done those basic things
2010-05-09T23:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	G__81	if you then run: gksudo nvidia-settings ,set the res to a resolution your screen can display, then run: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf ,and change the res to what you wish
2010-05-09T23:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	G__81	obv need to save the new file and restart x once more
2010-05-09T23:26:00.000Z	G__81	ActionParsnip	i think you have not understood my problem, I am not able to see 1280 *1024 itself and if i set it manually i get only 75 % of the screen in the monitor
2010-05-09T23:26:00.000Z	G__81	ActionParsnip	the Card works perfectly fine with F12
2010-05-09T23:26:00.000Z	G__81	ActionParsnip	yeah i tried it it does not work
2010-05-09T23:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	G__81	very strange
2010-05-09T23:27:00.000Z	G__81	ActionParsnip	i read somewhere in the forums that the horizontal and vertical sync when changed shows more config
2010-05-09T23:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	G__81	tried different refresh rates with the res?
2010-05-09T23:28:00.000Z	G__81	ActionParsnip	i have not tried different refresh rates if you could help me out a little on this problem it would be really good
2010-12-19T09:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	G__81	#ubuntu+1 for natty discussion
