2008-07-04T00:35:00.000Z	zhaozhou		I'm not really good with beginners at all. :-(
2008-07-04T00:35:00.000Z	unop	zhaozhou	try helping if you can - but don't feel obliged to say anything if you can't help, it only frustrates people more
2008-08-30T16:45:00.000Z	zhaozhou	unop	Markus: it does work. sudo starts a new shell with root access, that shell cd's to /home, then it exists successfully.
2008-08-30T16:46:00.000Z	unop	zhaozhou	what do you mean exactly?
2008-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	unop	zhaozhou	did you mean doing something like.  sudo cd /home  ???
2008-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	unop	zhaozhou	if that's the case - that won't work
2008-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	zhaozhou	unop	exactly.
2008-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	unop	zhaozhou	that won't work .. cd is not a command
2008-08-30T16:48:00.000Z	zhaozhou	unop	err?
2008-08-30T16:48:00.000Z	zhaozhou	unop	how about change directory?
2008-08-30T16:48:00.000Z	unop	zhaozhou	err what?  cd is a bash builtin not a command
2008-08-30T16:49:00.000Z	unop	zhaozhou	meaning sudo does not know which executable to use when you type.  sudo cd /home
2008-08-30T16:49:00.000Z	zhaozhou	unop	Ah, yes, could be so. :-)
2008-08-30T16:49:00.000Z	unop	zhaozhou	you are welcome to try it out for yourself.
2008-08-30T16:50:00.000Z	unop	zhaozhou	to work around.  sudo bash -c 'cd /home; command'
2008-08-30T16:50:00.000Z	zhaozhou	unop	I were'nt the one having the problem. :-)
2008-08-30T16:51:00.000Z	unop	zhaozhou	well technically telling someone to do something that does not work is a problem eh. :)
2008-08-30T16:53:00.000Z	zhaozhou	unop	I were'nt telling someone to do it either. xD
2008-08-30T16:54:00.000Z	unop	zhaozhou	you were telling me it would work .. that counts
2008-08-30T16:55:00.000Z	zhaozhou	unop	Nah, i told you both it would work, but it would just execute the command then return to normal. The end-user would'nt notice.
2008-08-30T16:56:00.000Z	unop	zhaozhou	sorry but you were wrong. now let it go please
2008-08-30T16:56:00.000Z	zhaozhou	unop	Oh wow.
