2007-05-06T12:55:00.000Z	astonerbum		Can anyone please assist me with setting up SoundBlaster Audigy2 on ubuntu 7.04 x86_64
2007-05-06T12:55:00.000Z	variant	astonerbum	whats the issue your having?
2007-05-06T12:56:00.000Z	astonerbum	variant	well i cant get sound working on my distro
2007-05-06T12:56:00.000Z	astonerbum	variant	basically autodetect = no sound
2007-05-06T12:56:00.000Z	variant	astonerbum	which distro, have you tried anything to make it work yet?
2007-05-06T12:56:00.000Z	variant	astonerbum	probably just the volumes need setting
2007-05-06T12:56:00.000Z	astonerbum	variant	i can do the ADC
2007-05-06T12:57:00.000Z	variant	astonerbum	in the package manager select "aumix" and install it, it's quite a nice mixer. use that to set all the sound levels up untill you hear stuff
2007-05-06T12:57:00.000Z	astonerbum	variant	sorry all voer the place: one big reply: autodetect not working, ADC works, but not for all apps (such as firefox + flash)
2007-05-06T12:57:00.000Z	variant	astonerbum	what is adc?
2007-05-06T12:58:00.000Z	variant	astonerbum	so you do have some sound then.. what exactly is not working?
2007-05-06T12:58:00.000Z	astonerbum	variant	Multichannel playback also gives sound, but low quality
2007-05-06T12:58:00.000Z	astonerbum	variant	basically not all aps work with the sound configurations
2007-05-06T12:58:00.000Z	variant	astonerbum	sorry, for more advanced sound setup I don't know anything really. not a sound man myself :)
2007-05-06T12:59:00.000Z	astonerbum	variant	doh!
2007-05-06T12:59:00.000Z	variant	astonerbum	check the alsa wiki out, it's a treasure trove
2007-05-06T12:59:00.000Z	variant	astonerbum	http://alsa.opensrc.org/Main_Page
2007-05-06T13:00:00.000Z	variant	astonerbum	those will tend to be generic instructions though.. not ubuntu specific
2007-05-06T13:00:00.000Z	astonerbum	variant	meh why not, ive tried forms already :)
2007-05-06T13:00:00.000Z	variant	astonerbum	http://alsa.opensrc.org/Sound_cards your card is listed there near the top
2007-05-06T13:07:00.000Z	variant	astonerbum	from the link i showed you it would seem that that card does not have much more support than that which you already have
2007-05-06T13:08:00.000Z	astonerbum	variant	hmmm...
