2011-05-31T15:16:00.000Z	codingenesis		what ever images i saw got saved in .thumbnails folder in home !! How is that possible ???
2011-05-31T15:16:00.000Z	codingenesis		does it mean someone hacked my pc ???
2011-05-31T15:17:00.000Z	tanath	codingenesis	uh, they're the cached thumbnails...
2011-05-31T15:18:00.000Z	codingenesis	tanath	: So it is all normal ??
2011-05-31T15:18:00.000Z	tanath	codingenesis	yes
2011-05-31T15:19:00.000Z	tanath	codingenesis	file manager makes thumbnails (mini versions) so you can see what the image looks like before opening it. these are cached so it doesn't have to recreate them every time
2011-05-31T15:19:00.000Z	codingenesis	tanath	so why they are stored in thumbnails folder??
2011-05-31T15:19:00.000Z	tanath	codingenesis	that's the location of the cache. such mini images are known as thumbnails
2011-05-31T15:20:00.000Z	tanath	codingenesis	for performance
2011-05-31T15:20:00.000Z	tanath	codingenesis	would be slow if it had to rescan all the images every time you opened the folder
2011-05-31T15:22:00.000Z	codingenesis	tanath	thanks  :)   so in windows there must also be something similar to thumbnails folder ???
2011-05-31T15:22:00.000Z	tanath	codingenesis	yeah
2011-05-31T15:23:00.000Z	codingenesis	tanath	can you tell me where i can find that??
2011-05-31T15:23:00.000Z	tanath	codingenesis	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_thumbnail_cache
2011-05-31T15:25:00.000Z	codingenesis	tanath	if  a remote computer wants to access those thumbnails can they access it
2011-05-31T15:26:00.000Z	tanath	codingenesis	not generally... they'd have to be able to access the folder. in which case they can access the images themselves
2011-05-31T15:27:00.000Z	codingenesis	tanath	Thanks friend for your help !! :)
2011-05-31T15:27:00.000Z	tanath	codingenesis	np
