2009-02-25T07:31:00.000Z	Palermo_		hey guys how can i setup software raid in ubuntu? ive already installed the system and i want to raid two 1.5tb harddrives together?
2009-02-25T07:33:00.000Z	Palermo_		raid 0
2009-02-25T07:33:00.000Z	Palermo_		want it to see both as 1 drive combined storage
2009-02-25T07:33:00.000Z	linny1	Palermo_	cant you just use lvm ?
2009-02-25T07:34:00.000Z	Palermo_	linny1	 LVM?
2009-02-25T07:35:00.000Z	linny1	Palermo_	logical volume manager you will see as one volume but its no striped or anything
2009-02-25T07:35:00.000Z	Palermo_	linny1	how do i se that up?
2009-02-25T07:41:00.000Z	linny1	Palermo_	heres some info that may be relevent http://beginlinux.wordpress.com/2008/05/30/raid-lvm-and-acls-on-ubuntu-804/ but imo its much easyer to setup lvms during installs i personally use encrypted lvms on all my pcs theres a tut here http://kuparinen.org/martti/comp/ubuntu/en/cryptolvm.html
2009-02-25T07:50:00.000Z	linny1	Palermo_	what do ypu mean ?
2009-02-25T07:51:00.000Z	Palermo_	linny1	i didnt see instructions on how to set up lvm
2009-02-25T08:01:00.000Z	linny1	Palermo_	ok it sees the disk fine
2009-02-25T07:53:00.000Z	linny1	Palermo_	what doesnt see the correct size ?
2009-02-25T07:54:00.000Z	linny1	Palermo_	what do you get from sudo fdisk -l
2009-02-25T07:54:00.000Z	linny1	Palermo_	and df -h
2009-02-25T07:57:00.000Z	Palermo_	linny1	what do u think from my pasting?
2009-02-25T08:00:00.000Z	linny1	Palermo_	no, btw did you partition the disks manually or did ubuntu do it ?
2009-02-25T08:02:00.000Z	Palermo_	linny1	and you see that from the first command you gave me right?
2009-02-25T08:04:00.000Z	linny1	Palermo_	i dont really understan what you are asking but if you use lvm all disks will apperar as on for file managment purposes yes
2009-02-25T08:04:00.000Z	Palermo_	linny1	lets say instead of upgrading to 9.04
2009-02-25T08:08:00.000Z	linny1	Palermo_	i really dont know as i said ive never done it after the installation but i think its possible to do it and save the data
2009-02-25T08:09:00.000Z	linny1	Palermo_	from what ive just seen from google tho it looks much more difficult than the way i normally do it
2009-02-25T08:09:00.000Z	Palermo_	linny1	is there a speed difference between raid0 and lvm
