2006-05-05T10:39:00.000Z	Acidic		Do the torrent programs work in text mode? Or are they purely gui?
2006-05-05T10:40:00.000Z	dli	Acidic	there are text only bt clients
2006-05-05T10:41:00.000Z	dli	Acidic	curses means text, I think
2006-05-05T10:41:00.000Z	dli	Acidic	tell me whether it works
2006-05-05T10:43:00.000Z	Acidic	dli	I apt-get install'd it but i can't seem to run it :/
2006-05-05T10:44:00.000Z	dli	Acidic	btdownload or something?
2006-05-05T10:44:00.000Z	Acidic	dli	? I did apt-get install bittornado
2006-05-05T10:47:00.000Z	dli	Acidic	try, /usr/bin/bittorrent-curses
2006-05-05T10:47:00.000Z	Acidic	dli	nope
2006-05-05T10:49:00.000Z	dli	Acidic	you can use "dpkg -c " to view the contents of a .deb, "cd /var/cache/apt/archives/", and check the .deb
2006-05-05T10:50:00.000Z	Acidic	dli	i have the contents on my screen, what should i do with them
2006-05-05T10:50:00.000Z	dli	Acidic	try to pipe it to "|grep bin" , or to "|less"
2006-05-05T10:51:00.000Z	dli	Acidic	like, "dpkg -c foo.deb|grep bin"
2006-05-05T10:52:00.000Z	dli	Acidic	then, you got them :)
2006-05-05T10:52:00.000Z	Acidic	dli	:they are obscure names unfortunately
2006-05-05T10:53:00.000Z	dli	Acidic	if they are in /usr/bin/, you can try to run them
2006-05-05T10:54:00.000Z	Acidic	dli	heh, there are many "runnables" but none of them seem to just run and download a .torrent file :/
2006-05-05T10:56:00.000Z	dli	Acidic	can you /msg me? I will check the list for you. sorry, I'm not running ubuntu myself
2006-05-05T10:57:00.000Z	Acidic	dli	um.. how do i become "registered"
2006-05-05T10:57:00.000Z	dli	Acidic	verify again
2006-05-05T10:57:00.000Z	Acidic	dli	with nickserv?
2006-05-05T10:58:00.000Z	dli	Acidic	yes
