2012-03-24T20:27:00.000Z	roasted		Anybody good with rsync? Curious how I can set up an exclude list. Is it just --exclude-from=/path/to/exclude/list?
2012-03-24T20:29:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	roasted	-C, --cvs-exclude
2012-03-24T20:30:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	roasted	or: -f, --filter=RULE        This option allows you to add rules to selectively exclude certain files from the list of files to be transferred
2012-03-24T20:31:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	roasted	or --exclude=PATTERN   or: --exclude-from=FILE
2012-03-24T20:31:00.000Z	roasted	remoteCTRL	I just want to set up a list so I can clean up my command. That way instead of having 20 --exclude's I can have 20 items in a file, and reference the file in my command.
2012-03-24T20:32:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	roasted	well man rsync confirms that what you mentioned is one possible way to acchieve that
2012-03-24T20:32:00.000Z	roasted	remoteCTRL	yes, I've been in man rsync. But I'm not sure why my command isn't working. Hence why I was asking for further clarification on it.
2012-03-24T20:33:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	roasted	different situation:what exactly isnt working? does it do nothing owr what happens?
2012-03-24T20:34:00.000Z	roasted	remoteCTRL	the output errors out on a specific item because I don't have permissions to it. So I excluded it, but it's still erroring out
2012-03-24T20:34:00.000Z	roasted	remoteCTRL	for some reason it's still "included" in the command.
2012-03-24T20:34:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	roasted	try instead of the path to the file to use a simple "-" which will prompt you for the files to omit, and see what happens then?
2012-03-24T20:35:00.000Z	roasted	remoteCTRL	yes, but then I have to exclude 20 items. that negates the point.
2012-03-24T20:36:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	roasted	do it only for ONE and see what happens
2012-03-24T20:36:00.000Z	roasted	remoteCTRL	it works if I do it individually. It does not work if I use the exclude list. that's why I'm asking for clarification on... the exclude list...
2012-03-24T20:37:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	roasted	no need to be neither impatient nor cynical dude, if you want me to stop trying to help you just say the word...
2012-03-24T20:37:00.000Z	roasted	remoteCTRL	I'm simply saying, what you're suggesting I've already done. I feel as though I stressed that several times.
2012-03-24T20:38:00.000Z	roasted	remoteCTRL	I just need clarification with the exclude list. Not individual items. Just the exclude list.
2012-03-24T20:39:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	roasted	you said you didnt want to write 20 exclude patterns in one commandline, well i was under the impression that writing something to a command line is something different thyn to be prompted for it, but since you seem to know better i will take myself out of the equasion, maxybe you can annoy somebody else...
2012-03-24T20:40:00.000Z	roasted	remoteCTRL	That sounds best. After all, I'm looking for clarification on the matter, which would suggest I would need to talk to somebody with more experience. Thanks for your time.
2012-03-24T20:40:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	roasted	maybe you also need a session with a psychologist on your anger issues? please dont talk to me any further
2012-03-24T20:41:00.000Z	roasted	remoteCTRL	lol. You're taking it a bit too far for this channel my friend. Once again, just looking for some help on the issue. As I said, thanks for your time. :D
2012-03-24T20:41:00.000Z	roasted	remoteCTRL	have a good day bro
