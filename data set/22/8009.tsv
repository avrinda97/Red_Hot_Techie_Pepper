2005-11-03T12:58:00.000Z	lanteau		I just installed ubuntu, it used the nv driver for xorg out of the box, but does it come with the nvidia? I noticed the nvidia modules exist but when I change nv in xorg.conf to nvidia x wont start..ideas?
2005-11-03T12:59:00.000Z	mustard5	lanteau	out of curiousity what kernel are you running?
2005-11-03T12:59:00.000Z	lanteau		isn't THC a drug? or like a chemical in marijuna
2005-11-03T12:59:00.000Z	lanteau		lemme check mustard5
2005-11-03T12:59:00.000Z	lanteau	mustard5	2.6.10-5-386
2005-11-03T13:00:00.000Z	mustard5	lanteau	hmmm well that blows my theory away :)  I've seen quite few with your issue on K7 kernel and I thought that might be the prolbem.
2005-11-03T13:01:00.000Z	lanteau		so changing nv to nvidia in xorg.conf is all i should have to do?
2005-11-03T13:02:00.000Z	lanteau	mustard5	Should I upgrade my kernel?
2005-11-03T13:02:00.000Z	mustard5	lanteau	no
2005-11-03T13:02:00.000Z	mustard5	lanteau	unless you really want to, but it wont fix this problem i dont think
2005-11-03T13:03:00.000Z	lanteau	mustard5	hmm I see
2005-11-03T13:04:00.000Z	lanteau	mustard5	Wow, sorry for wasting your time, I just needed to install nvidia-glx
2005-11-03T13:04:00.000Z	mustard5	lanteau	I'll just check the forum where I was reading about your issue..maybe something has changed
2005-11-03T13:05:00.000Z	mustard5	lanteau	oh..ok..hehe I would have normally said that myself, but it hasnt worked for some people lately :)
2005-11-03T13:06:00.000Z	lanteau		hmm...mustard5, What should I add to xorg.conf to get a 85hz refresh rate
2005-11-03T13:06:00.000Z	lanteau		Im trying to save my eyes here ;)
