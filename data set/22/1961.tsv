2010-03-23T01:56:00.000Z	bobstro	zoug_	 i wouldn't just pick an ip!
2010-03-23T02:00:00.000Z	bobstro	zoug_	 he isn't on WLAN, there is not ip to have
2010-03-23T02:00:00.000Z	zoug_	bobstro	he said wireless internet
2010-03-23T02:00:00.000Z	bobstro	zoug_	 yes, he keeps disconnecting after an hour
2010-03-23T02:00:00.000Z	zoug_	bobstro	so its WLAN, wireless..
2010-03-23T02:01:00.000Z	bobstro	zoug_	 until he reconnects, he won't have an IP address (dhcp)
2010-03-23T02:02:00.000Z	zoug_	bobstro	can change the static ip, if its not dhcp
2010-03-23T02:02:00.000Z	bobstro	zoug_	 he got an IP when he re-associated with the WLAN
2010-03-23T02:02:00.000Z	bobstro	zoug_	 just picking a random IP is probably a BAD idea if they're paranoid about security.
2010-03-23T02:03:00.000Z	zoug_	bobstro	what if dhcp is off? we dont yet know that do we?
2010-03-23T02:04:00.000Z	bobstro	zoug_	 the rest of the university is ok. he is now connected. so yes, i assume it's ok.
2010-03-23T02:09:00.000Z	bobstro	zoug_	 i suspect their dhcp lease is low, not setting up leases correclty
2010-03-23T02:09:00.000Z	zoug_	bobstro	yeah
2010-03-23T02:12:00.000Z	zoug_	bobstro	i hate those sysadmins
2010-03-23T02:21:00.000Z	bobstro	zoug_	 are you editing YOUR crontab?
2010-03-23T02:21:00.000Z	bobstro	zoug_	 and you have root access on this box?
2010-03-23T02:21:00.000Z	bobstro	zoug_	 cron will do it
2010-03-23T02:22:00.000Z	zoug_	bobstro	i dont want my crontab, i want roots crontab
2010-03-23T02:22:00.000Z	bobstro	zoug_	 and you can get root, right?
2010-03-23T02:22:00.000Z	bobstro	zoug_	 i'd put stuff like that under /etc/cron.d
2010-03-23T02:22:00.000Z	bobstro	zoug_	 you can specify who to run as there (incl. root)
2010-03-23T02:23:00.000Z	bobstro	zoug_	 individual crontabs work, of course, but i like having all "rooty" stuff in one place for ease of maintenance
