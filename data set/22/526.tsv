2011-08-27T04:27:00.000Z	false		Alright, I've been fighting with it for about an hour. Not making any ground. Running an HP laptop, wireless hardware switch disabled. How do I enable?
2011-08-27T04:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	false	run this to identify the card then let us know what it is   lspci | grep -i wireless
2011-08-27T04:31:00.000Z	false	urlin2u	Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR 5001 Wireless Network (rev 01)
2011-08-27T04:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	false	I have the same card, it has always worked, any more details you can share?
2011-08-27T04:34:00.000Z	false	urlin2u	Just installed 11.04 from disc onto the laptop, started out disabled.
2011-08-27T04:35:00.000Z	urlin2u	false	have you plugged in the ethernet cord and done a update/upgrade
2011-08-27T04:35:00.000Z	urlin2u	false	is there a switch that may be off?
2011-08-27T04:36:00.000Z	false	urlin2u	Yes, I did infact. Rebooted as the manger said, turned it back on and the "switch" still doesn't work. It's just a button beside the power button.
2011-08-27T04:37:00.000Z	false	urlin2u	It's lit up blue like in windows when it's on, but network settings still says it's disabled by hardware switch .
2011-08-27T04:38:00.000Z	urlin2u	false	look in additional drivers to see if any are available.
2011-08-27T04:39:00.000Z	false	urlin2u	Unfortunately, no. I've already looked there.
2011-08-27T04:39:00.000Z	urlin2u	false	 run this in the terminal sudo rfkill unblock all
2011-08-27T04:41:00.000Z	false	urlin2u	Supposed to get some kind of message? Just goes back to command line.
2011-08-27T04:41:00.000Z	urlin2u	false	try the swithch now
2011-08-27T04:42:00.000Z	false	urlin2u	No change :/
2011-08-27T04:42:00.000Z	urlin2u	false	thats about the extent of my knowledge in that area, sorry.
2011-08-27T04:45:00.000Z	false	urlin2u	Odd. I did rfkill list - saw the block, tried the unblock all again, worked.
2011-08-27T04:45:00.000Z	urlin2u	false	I'm giddy as a little girl. ;-)
2011-08-27T04:46:00.000Z	false	urlin2u	Not sure why it didn't unblock in the first place, I just trolled back up previous entered commands in terminal and hit it again? *shrug*
2011-08-27T04:46:00.000Z	urlin2u	false	lol
2011-08-27T04:46:00.000Z	false	urlin2u	Appreciate the help.
2011-08-27T04:47:00.000Z	urlin2u	false	no problem, gogoled it and got lucky.
