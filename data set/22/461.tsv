2012-07-24T11:32:00.000Z	z3bra		Hi all !
2012-07-24T11:33:00.000Z	z3bra		Can somebody help me to find a good lightweight web browser usable with keyboard only ?
2012-07-24T11:33:00.000Z	z3bra		(Or at least, help me to compile dwb...)
2012-07-24T11:34:00.000Z	Snowie	z3bra	look for a browser that runs in the terminal. not sure how useful that will be in the modern web though
2012-07-24T11:34:00.000Z	Snowie	z3bra	is this about accesability for someone with need to only use a keyboard?
2012-07-24T11:35:00.000Z	z3bra	Snowie	No, I just want to throw that mouse away
2012-07-24T11:35:00.000Z	Snowie	z3bra	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1646685
2012-07-24T11:35:00.000Z	Snowie	z3bra	diligent study of your browser shortcuts may help
2012-07-24T11:36:00.000Z	z3bra	Snowie	I know elinks thanks... But that's not what I'm looking for
2012-07-24T11:37:00.000Z	z3bra		I need something to browse the web with it's CSS, looking at videos, etc
2012-07-24T11:37:00.000Z	Snowie	z3bra	maybe look for a method of capturing keyboard input to control the mouse then. like a hotkey the allow the arrows on the keyboard to move the mouse cursor
2012-07-24T11:38:00.000Z	Snowie		anyone help me with my grub2 conf please. need the super gory version to eliminate black screen on boot issue.
2012-07-24T11:39:00.000Z	z3bra	Snowie	I dont want to use the cursor
2012-07-24T11:40:00.000Z	Snowie	z3bra	then your toast. Flash (all the pretty colorful stuff on the web like videos) wont accept any more than one press of the tab key
2012-07-24T11:41:00.000Z	z3bra	Snowie	take a look at dwb, jumanji or vimprobable
2012-07-24T11:42:00.000Z	z3bra		That's what I'm looking for
2012-07-24T11:42:00.000Z	z3bra		No needs to abuse <Tab>
2012-07-24T11:42:00.000Z	Snowie	z3bra	ok. so if you have your answer. why are you asking here?
2012-07-24T11:44:00.000Z	Snowie		BAN please mods.
2012-07-24T11:46:00.000Z	z3bra	Snowie	Those browsers don't exists in ubuntu repos, and I can't compile'em
2012-07-24T11:51:00.000Z	Snowie		 saturnast, its just such a complex system of characters. try this http://www.boutell.com/lsm/lsmbyid.cgi/000638
2012-07-24T11:52:00.000Z	Snowie	z3bra	sorry about the wait. perhaps ask on their channels or support for help compiling them. After all my googling, they do look like your only options.
