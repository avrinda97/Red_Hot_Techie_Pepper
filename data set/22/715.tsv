2012-07-13T05:31:00.000Z	escott	[snake]	why would you do that?
2012-07-13T05:32:00.000Z	[snake]	escott	no, why wouldn't you?
2012-07-13T05:32:00.000Z	escott	[snake]	because its a stupid crazy security risk for root to be sourcing any file which is not his own
2012-07-13T05:33:00.000Z	[snake]	escott	that's not what I said. seriously you're like a theologian putting in words that aren't there.
2012-07-13T05:33:00.000Z	escott	[snake]	then explain what you want to do. what other .bashrc are you talking about?
2012-07-13T05:36:00.000Z	[snake]	escott	I was going to make one, and color the User "root" red instead of green like I have it now. My prompt is like this for normal user: snake directory $ and like this for root: root directory # I have my user be green, and my root red. the problem is that sudo -s doesn't load root's bashrc file like su does.
2012-07-13T05:36:00.000Z	escott	[snake]	you want sudo -i
2012-07-13T05:38:00.000Z	[snake]	escott	thanks.
2012-07-13T05:39:00.000Z	escott	[snake]	looking at http://blog.colovirt.com/2009/08/18/linux-security-sudo-sudo-su-vs-sudo-s/ i'm hard pressed to think why you would ever want sudo -s... don't know how that meme got started
2012-07-13T05:40:00.000Z	[snake]	escott	OH... you shoul've been more clear about sudo -s vs sudo -i.... I thought you were talking about something else.
2012-07-13T05:41:00.000Z	[snake]	escott	before, when I called you a theologian. (I was joking though don't take it wrong)
2012-07-13T05:41:00.000Z	escott	[snake]	i've never used sudo -s myself. so the behavior of it seems strange to me. clearly you want -i (i would think most people would want -i)
2012-07-13T05:43:00.000Z	[snake]	escott	yeah, I would like to start using -i instead. It does what I want with the profiles as well as what you are saying; apparently it's more secure.
2012-07-13T05:43:00.000Z	escott	[snake]	lots of command switches. confusion happens. not a big deal
2012-11-05T05:37:00.000Z	escott	[snake]	gedit file1 & gedit file2 & gedit file3
2012-11-05T05:38:00.000Z	[snake]	escott	yeah, that's what I'm thinking. for some reason I have a bad habit of coming on here and asking questions that are obvious :P
2012-11-05T05:38:00.000Z	[snake]	escott	(at least for me- if I thought about it for a second)
2012-11-05T05:39:00.000Z	[snake]	escott	also shouldn't there be two & symbols or am I wrong?
2012-11-05T05:39:00.000Z	escott	[snake]	& and && have different meanings. the first says "run all these in the background" the second says "wait until the first completes and if successful run the next"
2012-11-05T05:40:00.000Z	[snake]	escott	ahh. thanks!! I actually didn't know that :P
2012-11-05T05:40:00.000Z	escott	[snake]	gui applications usually background themselves when they detect that they are running in shell so the behavior is much the same, but the semantics are different
2012-11-05T06:08:00.000Z	[snake]	escott	I agree!
