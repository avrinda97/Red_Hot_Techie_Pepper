2005-12-04T07:24:00.000Z	bimberi	slashx1896	there is no windows partition on that disk? (i may have misunderstood the situation)
2005-12-04T07:24:00.000Z	slashx1896	bimberi	i think i accdienty deleted my windows partitions
2005-12-04T07:25:00.000Z	bimberi	slashx1896	oh no, it does appear so, (i was hoping you were going to say you were going to install it)
2005-12-04T07:26:00.000Z	slashx1896	bimberi	wait wat?
2005-12-04T07:28:00.000Z	bimberi	slashx1896	i'm saying that yes you have (accidentally) deleted your windows partitions - i was hoping that you were going to say you hadn't installed windows yet
