2007-05-05T08:57:00.000Z	Pelo	moleboy	 for now you shouldn't need to do anything to your router, execpt maybe enable the wireless bit,
2007-05-05T08:58:00.000Z	Pelo	moleboy	 what you need to do is in your computer,  you need to install the driver for the wireless card in your comp if it isn'T and then set the network,  those instructions are in the links,
2007-05-05T08:58:00.000Z	moleboy	Pelo	I have the drivers on all my computers!
2007-05-05T08:59:00.000Z	Pelo	moleboy	 I dont, now crap about wireless connection myself I have never had or had to setup one,  try for instructions in this wikie it may help   http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty
