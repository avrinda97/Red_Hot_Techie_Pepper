2008-06-17T00:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Agu10	(it's not wise to try to hold the channel to randsom)
2008-06-17T00:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Agu10	click on them ?
2008-06-17T00:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Agu10	click them
2008-06-17T00:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Agu10	you select one, set it's mount point, then select the next one
2008-06-17T00:31:00.000Z	Agu10	ikonia	are you there? Do i have to format the partitions i will use?
2008-06-17T00:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Agu10	yes you do

2008-06-17T00:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Agu10	yes
2008-06-17T00:33:00.000Z	Agu10	ikonia	there is not the option to format the swap partition!
2008-06-17T00:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Agu10	it should do it for you
2008-06-17T00:33:00.000Z	Agu10	ikonia	but i cant select the format input
