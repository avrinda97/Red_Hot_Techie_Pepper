2011-03-08T09:19:00.000Z	meowski		can someone help me set up a wireless card on ubuntu? its an imac with a  BCM4328 Wifi Card?
2011-03-08T09:20:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	broadcom firmware should be included in the kernel
2011-03-08T09:20:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	I mean the driver for it should already be installed, you simply need to load it
2011-03-08T09:21:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	read the link Gnea gave you
2011-03-08T09:25:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	what error did you get?
2011-03-08T09:27:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	that sounds like it's not related to your problem
2011-03-08T09:29:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	that's the package maintainer's problem though
2011-03-08T09:29:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	you don't have to worry about problems with future versions
2011-03-08T09:31:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	instead of rebooting try "sudo modprobe -r b43 ssb wl" and "sudo modprobe wl"
2011-03-08T09:32:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	nothing, just run those two commands without the quotations
2011-03-08T09:33:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	no, just the two I pasted
2011-03-08T09:34:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	you shouldn't need to use ndiswrapper btw
2011-03-08T09:36:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	yeah, if the kernel modules are on your computer
2011-03-08T09:38:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	modprobe : )
2011-03-08T09:39:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	the commands posted on the ubuntu article try and load several different ones
2011-03-08T09:40:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	try substituting wl with b43
2011-03-08T09:41:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	do you have internet access right now?
2011-03-08T09:41:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	do "sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source"
2011-03-08T09:44:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	just hit y and then enter
2011-03-08T09:46:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	yeah, do sudo apt-get update
2011-03-08T09:49:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	it will update your entire system
2011-03-08T09:52:00.000Z	Nisstyre	meowski	I'm sorry, not really sure.
