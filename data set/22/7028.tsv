2007-06-29T11:31:00.000Z	iratik		root account unaffected - the other terminals logged into the server as other accounts unable to sudo  saying after entering the password  sudo: pam_authenticate: Authentication service cannot retrieve authentication info.
2007-06-29T11:33:00.000Z	iratik		Everyone: is that a good idea on a production system?
2007-06-29T11:33:00.000Z	iratik		there are 15 domains running on this system
2007-06-29T11:34:00.000Z	graft	iratik	just keep a root shell open so you can trouble shoot
2007-06-29T11:29:00.000Z	iratik	graft	you can use jack to reroute stereo mix into audacity
2007-06-29T11:29:00.000Z	graft	iratik	jack?
2007-06-29T11:30:00.000Z	graft	iratik	you mean jackd?
2007-06-29T11:33:00.000Z	graft	iratik	is what a good idea?
2007-06-29T11:33:00.000Z	iratik	graft	reinstall the passwd package?
2007-06-29T11:34:00.000Z	graft	iratik	sure, why not? gets upgraded from time to time, so reinstalling should be okay
2007-06-29T11:34:00.000Z	graft	iratik	if it's not okay, it'll complain
2007-06-29T11:41:00.000Z	graft	iratik	why reconstruct it from scratch? do you have a root shell open?
2007-06-29T11:42:00.000Z	iratik	graft	yeah... i have an /etc/passwd file - i've put together
2007-06-29T11:42:00.000Z	graft	iratik	and are you using shadow passwords?
2007-06-29T11:42:00.000Z	graft	iratik	does it have x instead of passwords in /etc/passwd
2007-06-29T11:43:00.000Z	graft	iratik	well /etc/shadow is easy - most of them shouhld be *... you just need real passwords for some
2007-06-29T11:43:00.000Z	graft	iratik	so make /etc/shadow with * for all of your users, then use your root shell & passwd to restore passwords
2007-06-29T11:43:00.000Z	graft	iratik	i wouldn't
2007-06-29T11:44:00.000Z	graft	iratik	since you have a root shell, you can use passwd <user> to recreate their password
