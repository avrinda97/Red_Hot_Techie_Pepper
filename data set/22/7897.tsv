2005-12-27T12:10:00.000Z	lysis	mrkoje	thank god i use two servers at once. ;)
2005-12-27T12:10:00.000Z	mrkoje	lysis	 what other good servers are out there?
2005-12-27T12:10:00.000Z	mrkoje	lysis	 I find this is the best tech server....
2005-12-27T12:11:00.000Z	lysis	mrkoje	i also chat with friends on 2600.  they're quite helpful with general linux questions that i'd rather not bother you with.   ubuntu on freenode is the BEST for ubuntu though. :)

2005-12-27T12:12:00.000Z	mrkoje	lysis	 well it is when I'm on anyway

2005-12-27T12:12:00.000Z	lysis		it's usually dead until late late like now.
2005-12-27T12:12:00.000Z	lysis		now there's 3 of us chatting out of the 30 in the room. *laughs*
