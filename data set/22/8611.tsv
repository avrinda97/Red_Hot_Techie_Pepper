2006-10-10T08:04:00.000Z	Cassandra		BTW I'm a newbie :p
2006-10-10T08:06:00.000Z	Cassandra		Oh wow, thanks
2006-10-10T08:07:00.000Z	Cassandra		So, my question is this:  I am trying to use nicotine but it won't let me sign in.  Does anyone know how I go about getting a user name?
2006-10-10T08:08:00.000Z	Cassandra		I don't even know if that is the trouble because the "connect" command isn't selectable.
2006-10-10T08:08:00.000Z	Cassandra		It is the linux version of soulseek.
2006-10-10T08:08:00.000Z	Cassandra		Is that what you mean?  It's unsupported.
2006-10-10T08:09:00.000Z	Cassandra		Thank you anyways.
2006-10-10T08:10:00.000Z	Cassandra		Is there something like this somewhere else I could ask for advice?
2006-10-10T08:11:00.000Z	Cassandra		Ok, how do I do that?
2006-10-10T08:11:00.000Z	Cassandra		This is my first time on here, sorry if it's tedious.
2006-10-10T08:11:00.000Z	dabaR	Cassandra	have you tried just using something you make up for the user name and password?
2006-10-10T08:12:00.000Z	dabaR	Cassandra	relax
2006-10-10T08:13:00.000Z	dabaR	Cassandra	ya, it seems that you can just use whatever as the user name.
2006-10-10T08:13:00.000Z	dabaR	Cassandra	as long as it is not already used.
2006-10-10T08:14:00.000Z	dabaR	Cassandra	heh:)
2006-10-10T08:14:00.000Z	dabaR	Cassandra	I used google to come up with your user name.
2006-10-10T08:15:00.000Z	Cassandra	dabaR	 What do you mean google?
2006-10-10T08:15:00.000Z	dabaR	Cassandra	I entered "nicotine sign in soulseek" into google, and used the first link
2006-10-10T08:16:00.000Z	Cassandra	dabaR	 Ok, I'll have a look at that.  I still can't 'connect'
2006-10-10T08:18:00.000Z	dabaR	Cassandra	what is the server you are trying to connect to?
2006-10-10T08:20:00.000Z	dabaR	Cassandra	try something like cassie12345 and some password to sign in. it may be that your user name is taken.
2006-10-10T08:22:00.000Z	Cassandra	dabaR	I just tried your advice what doesn't seem to be the problem.
