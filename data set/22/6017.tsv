2007-02-07T11:54:00.000Z	luiX_	PriceChild	need something to control the fan's speed and to show the state of the fan
2007-02-07T11:54:00.000Z	PriceChild	luiX_	I have a link to a nice little howto on the forums to get "lm-sensors" working... one moment
2007-02-07T11:55:00.000Z	PriceChild	luiX_	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2780 still valid despite how old
2007-02-07T11:55:00.000Z	luiX_	PriceChild	thanks
2007-02-07T12:00:00.000Z	luiX_	PriceChild	i've missed something between step2 and 3, where do you run the script?
2007-02-07T12:00:00.000Z	PriceChild	luiX_	is this sensors?
2007-02-07T12:01:00.000Z	PriceChild	luiX_	thanks for the clarification, I was sure it did ( Mrulez )
2007-02-07T12:02:00.000Z	luiX_	PriceChild	what sensors?
2007-02-07T12:03:00.000Z	PriceChild	luiX_	sorry I've forgotten what i was helping you with :)
2007-02-07T12:03:00.000Z	luiX_	PriceChild	i mean, the how-to tells nothing about getting the source, but step2 sais to run that script on the souce folder
2007-02-07T12:03:00.000Z	PriceChild	luiX_	is this the lm-sensors howto?
2007-02-07T12:04:00.000Z	PriceChild	luiX_	ah don't worry about that... just run the script as suggested :)
2007-02-07T12:05:00.000Z	luiX_	PriceChild	....i don't know what is suggested
2007-02-07T12:05:00.000Z	PriceChild	luiX_	copy the text into a file, make it executable and then run it
2007-02-07T12:05:00.000Z	luiX_	PriceChild	it sais to run it in the source but the 1st step sais to install it from apt
2007-02-07T12:05:00.000Z	PriceChild	luiX_	just do the second bit in your home dir
2007-02-07T12:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	luiX_	don't worry about that bit
2007-02-07T12:06:00.000Z	luiX_	PriceChild	ok, i know what it does, and it was the problem i had (i guess)
2007-02-07T12:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	luiX_	it worked fine for me...
