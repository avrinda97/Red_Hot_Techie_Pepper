2006-03-23T11:10:00.000Z	linuxdoesnthatem		they're both connected to the same router
2006-03-23T11:12:00.000Z	linuxdoesnthatem		!ssh
2006-03-23T11:13:00.000Z	linuxdoesnthatem		OK, ubuntu hates me
2006-03-23T11:13:00.000Z	linuxdoesnthatem		*mad*
2006-03-23T11:14:00.000Z	linuxdoesnthatem		this is killing me
2006-03-23T11:14:00.000Z	linuxdoesnthatem		two hours, still no dice
2006-03-23T11:14:00.000Z	linuxdoesnthatem		All I want to do is move files from one machine to another
2006-03-23T11:14:00.000Z	linuxdoesnthatem		it shouldn't be this difficult
2006-03-23T11:15:00.000Z	linuxdoesnthatem		I'd like to use ssh
2006-03-23T11:15:00.000Z	linuxdoesnthatem		problem is, I'm using a router
2006-03-23T11:15:00.000Z	chuckyp	linuxdoesnthatem	or you could use sftp
2006-03-23T11:16:00.000Z	chuckyp	linuxdoesnthatem	sftp <username>@<ipaddress>
2006-03-23T11:16:00.000Z	chuckyp	linuxdoesnthatem	will get you ftp access on the remote machine
2006-03-23T11:18:00.000Z	chuckyp	linuxdoesnthatem	well you can ifconfig
2006-03-23T11:18:00.000Z	chuckyp	linuxdoesnthatem	ifconfig=ipconfig but you can actually configure devices with it.
2006-03-23T11:19:00.000Z	chuckyp	linuxdoesnthatem	you may need to enable ssh on whatever box you are trying to get files off of.
2006-03-23T11:19:00.000Z	chuckyp	linuxdoesnthatem	are the computers both on the same network? or is this over the internet?
2006-03-23T11:20:00.000Z	chuckyp	linuxdoesnthatem	then yes the internal ips will work.
2006-03-23T11:21:00.000Z	chuckyp	linuxdoesnthatem	But in the future if you need to figure out your external ip but it woldn't apply here you could browse to www.whatismyip.com  will tell you.
2006-03-23T11:28:00.000Z	chuckyp	linuxdoesnthatem	do you have ssh enabled on the computer you are trying to connect to?
2006-03-23T11:57:00.000Z	chuckyp	linuxdoesnthatem	just follow that to install ssh on the other box you are trying to copy from.
2006-03-23T12:06:00.000Z	chuckyp	linuxdoesnthatem	its openssh-server is the package name so sudo apt-get install openssh-server
