2005-10-11T13:43:00.000Z	thefoot		hmm after installing Samba, looking at the Network > General Tab.  There is no check box for Windows Networking
2005-10-11T13:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	maybe system -> admin -> shared folders
2005-10-11T13:45:00.000Z	thefoot	HappyFool	 that doesnt let me setup my windows settings though like domain name etc..
2005-10-11T13:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	hrm. you're following the wiki page, right?
2005-10-11T13:46:00.000Z	thefoot	HappyFool	i sure am
2005-10-11T13:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	standby...
2005-10-11T13:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	hmm
2005-10-11T13:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	the wiki is confusing
2005-10-11T13:49:00.000Z	thefoot	HappyFool	 more like outdated
2005-10-11T13:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	well, the alternative is to edit /etc/samba/smb.conf
2005-10-11T13:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	or, possibly easier, you can run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure samba'
2005-10-11T13:57:00.000Z	thefoot	HappyFool	find anything?
2005-10-11T13:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	no, i checked if there was a gnome-samba package of some sort, but nothing
2005-10-11T13:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	how computer-clueful are you?
2005-10-11T13:58:00.000Z	thefoot	HappyFool	windows based im very good
2005-10-11T13:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	for starters, try backing up /etc/samba/smb.conf and run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure samba'
2005-10-11T14:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	oh, that doesn't do much
2005-10-11T14:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	the reconfigure is a bit useless, sorry
2005-10-11T14:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	choose 'daemons'
2005-10-11T14:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	unfortunately you'll have to edit /etc/samba/smb.conf
2005-10-11T14:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	'sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf' (or 'gksudo gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf' if your prefer a GUI editor)
2005-10-11T14:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	thefoot	i must be off now, sorry. the wiki page is a bit useless; you can try www.samba.org -- they have lots of docs, including 'howtos' for various usage scenarios
