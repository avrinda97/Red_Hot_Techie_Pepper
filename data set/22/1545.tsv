2010-04-15T03:08:00.000Z	underdev		hi!  anyone having a problem connecting to ubuntu one?
2010-04-15T03:09:00.000Z	underdev		okay, so its not jsut me than
2010-04-15T03:09:00.000Z	underdev		okay, cool
2010-04-15T03:09:00.000Z	underdev		yeah, they really opened the pipes for lucid, must be taking all their bandwidth
2010-04-15T03:10:00.000Z	underdev		thanks guys
2010-04-15T03:11:00.000Z	underdev		 leeward can you boot live?  have you tried alternative?
2010-04-15T03:11:00.000Z	leeward	underdev	what is alternative that non gui  mode ?
2010-04-15T03:12:00.000Z	underdev	leeward	yes
2010-04-15T03:12:00.000Z	underdev	leeward	exactly
2010-04-15T03:12:00.000Z	leeward	underdev	CD checksums ok
2010-04-15T03:13:00.000Z	underdev	leeward	you can download alternative from the same place you got desktop, or use the torrent, which tends to be much faster
2010-04-15T03:13:00.000Z	underdev	leeward	does it boot the live cd
2010-04-15T03:13:00.000Z	leeward	underdev	hardware worked fine until 1 hr ago when I toasted windows  :)
2010-04-15T03:13:00.000Z	leeward	underdev	thanks I'll give it a test
2010-04-15T03:14:00.000Z	underdev	leeward	if you can't boot live, there is probably an incompatibility
2010-04-15T03:14:00.000Z	leeward	underdev	testing live CD again  just changed bios... should use  non-plug andplay bios  correct ?
2010-04-15T03:14:00.000Z	underdev	leeward	this is probably blasphemy here, but you might want to burn puppy linux and see if that cd will boot live
2010-04-15T03:15:00.000Z	underdev	leeward	don't mess with anything at first, just try to boot from the cd with the same config as windows
2010-04-15T03:15:00.000Z	leeward	underdev	 btw i'm not a linux newbie.. may help save time a bit... ;)
2010-04-15T03:23:00.000Z	leeward	underdev	9.10 live CD not booting... same error
2010-04-15T03:23:00.000Z	leeward	underdev	downloading alternate now...  should be 30 mins before testing
2010-04-15T04:29:00.000Z	leeward	underdev	ubuntu mini install in progress... thanks for pointing towards the alternate versions. kudos to the channel's team
