2011-06-05T05:24:00.000Z	Guest65324		I am not opposed to actually formatting the hard drive.... I am wondering if using a live cd would make accomplishing my task any easier
2011-06-05T05:24:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest65324	what are you trying to do?
2011-06-05T05:26:00.000Z	Guest65324	KM0201	 I took an 80 GB SATA laptop hard drive and put it on a USB sled, with the intention of formatting it and mounting it as a new storage volume
2011-06-05T05:26:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest65324	ok... that really shouldn't be an issue, ubuntu can mount ntfs pretty easily.
2011-06-05T05:27:00.000Z	Guest65324	KM0201	 I am wondering if it's possible to either format the drive from the normal running kernel or to  somehow "clean" its  status  thus making it mountable
2011-06-05T05:27:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest65324	it should mount w/o being formatted to be truthful...
2011-06-05T05:27:00.000Z	Guest65324	KM0201	 agreed, ntfs is normally not an issue, but I am getting a complaint about the drive already being mounted
2011-06-05T05:31:00.000Z	Guest65324	KM0201	 no i havent

2011-06-05T05:34:00.000Z	Guest65324	KM0201	 thanks I am reading now
2011-06-05T05:34:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest65324	look at the manually mounting/unmounting section.
2011-06-05T05:35:00.000Z	Guest65324	KM0201	 thanks
2011-06-05T05:35:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest65324	if it already has a mount point, you don't need to make one (i'm assuming it does)
2011-06-05T05:49:00.000Z	Guest65324	KM0201	 and it sure did work
2011-06-05T05:36:00.000Z	Guest65324	KM0201	 :) okay
2011-06-05T05:36:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest65324	you can pastebin it and i'll look at it, but no promises
2011-06-05T05:36:00.000Z	Guest65324	KM0201	 thanks ;]

2011-06-05T05:46:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest65324	yup, looks like it did.
2011-06-05T05:47:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest65324	now as long as it works.. :)
2011-06-05T05:48:00.000Z	Guest65324	KM0201	 that's what I'm about to determine
2011-06-05T05:49:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest65324	great... terminal is weird like that, it'll often tell you what you have to do.
