2007-12-12T17:42:00.000Z	blankthemuffin		Yeah I think the one in my PC is pretty good
2007-12-12T17:44:00.000Z	blankthemuffin		I dunno, but my N-Force 4 chipset must have it
2007-12-12T17:44:00.000Z	blankthemuffin		and my old PC would have had it too
2007-12-12T17:44:00.000Z	blankthemuffin		you got them connected bb882 ?
2007-12-12T17:45:00.000Z	blankthemuffin		mmm, you will have to set up ip's for them both
2007-12-12T17:45:00.000Z	blankthemuffin		you have any idea what I'm talking about bb882 ?
2007-12-12T17:45:00.000Z	blankthemuffin		because if you don't it's probably a darn sight easier to put it on the dvd :P
