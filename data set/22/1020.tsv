2011-01-09T19:48:00.000Z	waot		i should call that customer back and have him kick our ass
2011-01-09T19:49:00.000Z	waot		 I configured:   view   all    included    .1  in snmpd.conf but I am not able to walk .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.6 ;  HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrDiskStorageAccess. I get no output.  I have /usr/share/snmp/mibs/HOST-RESOURCES-MIB.txt it exists and it does have that OID defined in it.. I am using snmpd  5.4.2.1. I believe to have the same exact snmpd configuration on my Gentoo system and it works fine.  What could be the problem?
2011-01-09T19:51:00.000Z	waot		and I already have numerous snmp extends
2011-01-09T19:51:00.000Z	waot		what does that have to do with not being able to walk the MIB?
2011-01-09T19:51:00.000Z	waot		but I can on my gentoo system with the same config
2011-01-09T19:52:00.000Z	waot		yea im screwed
2011-01-09T19:52:00.000Z	waot		another snmp extend joy
2011-01-09T19:52:00.000Z	waot		totally defeating the purpose of snmp
2011-01-09T19:52:00.000Z	waot		thanks ubuntu
2011-01-09T19:53:00.000Z	waot		should make a graph of irc worthlessness over time, would show steady decline
2011-01-09T19:54:00.000Z	sacarlson	waot	I use snmp in cacti
2011-01-09T19:54:00.000Z	waot	sacarlson	are you able to walk .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.6 on your ubuntu system?
2011-01-09T19:55:00.000Z	waot	sacarlson	its suppose to be HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrDiskStorageAccess to show if its readonly or not
2011-01-09T19:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	waot	I'm not sure what the .1.3.6.1..... is but yes I get a responce from ubuntu 10.04 on my cacti config
2011-01-09T19:56:00.000Z	waot	sacarlson	what you get readWrite?
2011-01-09T19:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	waot	I'll have to check, the default in cacti is bandwidth usage and cpu , mem usage
2011-01-09T19:57:00.000Z	waot	sacarlson	its just an integer 0 or 1 value for read-write or read only for the disk
2011-01-09T19:57:00.000Z	waot	sacarlson	I can't walk it with duplicate configs from a working system
2011-01-09T19:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	waot	I can pastebin the results if you like pm'ed
2011-01-09T19:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	waot	maybe one is localhost and the other is remote?
2011-01-09T19:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	waot	I think it defaults to accept localhost and any other requires mod to config?
2011-01-09T20:00:00.000Z	waot	sacarlson	its setup to be a default source and view subtree .1 ...I copied the same config over from the working sytem (Gentoo) to the Ubuntu... same snmpd version and it does not work.. and the mib exists at /usr/share/snmp/mibs/HOST-RESOURCES-MIB.txt
