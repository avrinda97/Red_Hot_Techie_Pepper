2007-06-29T11:40:00.000Z	RonzO	iratik	are there any user accounts working on the server, or are they not working, due to the corrupted passwd file?

2007-06-29T11:53:00.000Z	iratik	RonzO	nope
2007-06-29T12:34:00.000Z	iratik	RonzO	fixed it!
2007-06-29T12:34:00.000Z	iratik	RonzO	when i had copied a section of /etc/passwd from another system to myne trying to reconstruct a viable file -- i copied an account with the same uid!
