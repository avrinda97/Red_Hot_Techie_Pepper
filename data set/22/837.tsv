2011-02-24T04:53:00.000Z	kj6lxu		 when i go to places and click home ubuntu opens my media player. how do i get this to stop ?????
2011-02-24T04:55:00.000Z	kj6lxu		konaya_: last week but i have had 10.10 installed on this system for 2months
2011-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	konaya	kj6lxu	weird. Does it happen when you click on other folders in Places or just the Home folder?
2011-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	kj6lxu	konaya	all folders exept network
2011-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	konaya	kj6lxu	also, which media player is it?
2011-02-24T04:58:00.000Z	kj6lxu	konaya	mplayer but when i uninstall it totiom opens
2011-02-24T05:01:00.000Z	konaya	kj6lxu	could you give me line 4 of the file /usr/share/applications/nautilus-home.desktop?
2011-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	konaya	kj6lxu	still alive?
2011-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	kj6lxu	konaya	TryExec=nautilus
2011-02-24T05:06:00.000Z	konaya	kj6lxu	alright. What happens if you open a new terminal, type nautilus, and press enter?
2011-02-24T05:08:00.000Z	kj6lxu	konaya	it opens but when i go in to a sub folder there is a ubuntu one disabled notice at the top
2011-02-24T05:10:00.000Z	konaya	kj6lxu	should be an unrelated problem, not sure. Could you give me line 1 of the file .gtk-bookmarks in your home folder? I think I know what the problem could be, just need to find where exactly we change it back.
2011-02-24T05:11:00.000Z	kj6lxu	konaya	file:///home/sydmarty/Documents
2011-02-24T05:12:00.000Z	konaya	kj6lxu	run gconftool-2 -g /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/file/command
2011-02-24T05:12:00.000Z	konaya	kj6lxu	What does it say?
2011-02-24T05:14:00.000Z	kj6lxu	konaya	it does not reconize the command    "   run    "
2011-02-24T05:14:00.000Z	konaya	kj6lxu	that might be because the word "run" wasn't part of the command.  :)
2011-02-24T05:15:00.000Z	konaya	kj6lxu	just gconftool-2 -g /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/file/command
2011-02-24T05:16:00.000Z	kj6lxu	konaya	sorry about the bone head move and it prints out       No value set for `/desktop/gnome/url-handlers/file/command'
2011-02-24T05:17:00.000Z	konaya	kj6lxu	no worries :) Hm. I'll privmsg three commands to you (don't want to spam the channel), hold on a sec.
2011-02-24T05:18:00.000Z	konaya	kj6lxu	There you go. These might work, not sure. Quite frankly, I'm a bit confused as to what it might be, but that might override the problem if we're lucky.
2011-02-24T05:20:00.000Z	konaya	kj6lxu	did they work?
