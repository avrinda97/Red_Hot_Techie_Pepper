2010-04-20T16:46:00.000Z	a_h_roth		Hello.  I've been trying to install Firefox 3.6.3 from firefox-stable (https://launchpad.net/~mozillateam/+archive/firefox-stable), but it insists on installing Firefox 3.6.  Any pointers on what I might be doing wrong?
2010-04-20T16:47:00.000Z	a_h_roth		Oh, and I'm doing this on (I know, I know) Hardy.
2010-04-20T16:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	a_h_roth	umm, look for a PPA
2010-04-20T16:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	a_h_roth	guess I don't have to tell you about OEM and breakage...
2010-04-20T16:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	a_h_roth	not OEM but EOL
2010-04-20T16:49:00.000Z	a_h_roth	IdleOne	EOL and breakage?
2010-04-20T16:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	a_h_roth	EOL is End of Life, which does not apply in this case so never mind that. why not just wait till the end of the month and upgrade to 10.04 which has FF3.6.3?
2010-04-20T16:51:00.000Z	a_h_roth	IdleOne	I'm running an old machine.  I tried installing Lucid on it, and had all sorts of problems with the graphics cards, so I went back to Hardy.
2010-04-20T16:53:00.000Z	IdleOne	a_h_roth	gimme a minute to find the PPA
2010-04-20T16:53:00.000Z	a_h_roth	IdleOne	thanks.  I thought I was using the correct PPA.  But I guess not.
2010-04-20T16:54:00.000Z	a_h_roth	IdleOne	I added the entries to sources.list, and added the correct key, but it installs 3.6, not 3.6.3.
2010-04-20T16:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	a_h_roth	think the firefox-stable is 3.6
2010-04-20T16:55:00.000Z	a_h_roth	IdleOne	that would explain it, although the web page at https://launchpad.net/~mozillateam/+archive/firefox-stable insists that it's 3.6.3.
2010-04-20T16:56:00.000Z	IdleOne	a_h_roth	looking at the PPA on launchpad, that is the correct one and the package installs 3.6.3
2010-04-20T16:57:00.000Z	a_h_roth	IdleOne	this brings me back to my original problem.  If that's so, why is 3.6 installing?
2010-04-20T16:57:00.000Z	IdleOne	a_h_roth	just the way the package was named probably. what does apt-cache policy firefox show you
2010-04-20T16:59:00.000Z	a_h_roth	IdleOne	http://paste.ubuntu.com/419199/
2010-04-20T17:00:00.000Z	IdleOne	a_h_roth	well if you feel adventurous you can install the daily build from https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mozilla-daily/+archive/ppa?field.series_filter=hardy
2010-04-20T17:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	a_h_roth	that should give you 3.6.5
2010-04-20T17:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	a_h_roth	you did update the sources list after adding the PPA?
2010-04-20T17:01:00.000Z	a_h_roth	IdleOne	I suppose I could.  I could also download the .deb pkg directly from firefox.com and install that.  But I didn't want to screw up the package managment.
2010-04-20T17:02:00.000Z	a_h_roth	IdleOne	of course.  I did run sudo apt-get update.
