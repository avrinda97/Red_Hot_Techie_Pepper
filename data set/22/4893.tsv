2007-09-22T13:35:00.000Z	jugimaster		Hello :)  ..   - Can anyone think of a reason why running bittorrent downloads would seriously clog up one's internet connection?  I mean, the torrents themselves run very slowly, my upload speed is at about 15% of the maximum even though there's no limit set,  and umm..  generally things become very unresponsive if i run a torrent client..
2007-09-22T13:35:00.000Z	USMarine	jugimaster	have a look in azureus wiki
2007-09-22T13:36:00.000Z	jugimaster	USMarine	well, i've been trying things out with different bt clients, and so far my network clogs up with each of them
