2007-07-23T14:39:00.000Z	Coolranch		i get the ubuntu splash screen with the orange bar and it just freezes
2007-07-23T14:39:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	have you tried a fresh load?
2007-07-23T14:40:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	Okay, you aren't even getting to live CD yet?
2007-07-23T14:41:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	okay, cool, lets start with the basics first. do you think you may have gotten a bad burn to CD?
2007-07-23T14:42:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	well for safety measures, I would go to Ubuntu.com and try to re-download the wanted version, burn it to disc, and see what happens..
2007-07-23T14:44:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	if you can't even get Live CD to run, there isn't a whole lot you will be able to do..
2007-07-23T14:48:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	yes, boot from CD
2007-07-23T14:50:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	yup, I am thinking you have a bad burn, but hold on, let me check the wiki..
2007-07-23T14:54:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	that looks like an uncommon error. Again, try a download and re-burn..
2007-07-23T14:55:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	it seems uncommon to me. What kind of computer are you loading it on?
2007-07-23T14:57:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	on an older computer, you may have issues with a newer version, You may want to look at  lighter model.
2007-07-23T14:59:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	how much memory does your computer have?
2007-07-23T15:01:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	in that case you need to go to Ubuntu.com, and download the "Alternate install" disk.
2007-07-23T15:03:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	bright side, after the install, it should run with little issue..
2007-07-23T15:05:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	Right under "start download" there is a check box for "Alternate desktop CD"
2007-07-23T15:05:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	see it?
2007-07-23T15:06:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	fair warning, the text install may be a little confusing, keep a notepad with you while installing to write down anything that you may need to remember..
2007-07-23T15:07:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	slackware can be a bother like that, older versions of Gentoo as well..
2007-07-23T15:10:00.000Z	genefitz	Coolranch	I had the same Mandrake 9 on my old computer from the time I bought it, till the time I sold it.. I think the guy who bought it is still using it...
