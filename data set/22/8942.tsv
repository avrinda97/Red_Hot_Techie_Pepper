2006-06-17T12:10:00.000Z	mooseman447		do you know how to make xchat auto join servers?
2006-06-17T12:11:00.000Z	witless	mooseman447	in the server list, click edit, and there's a space for "channels to join"
2006-06-17T12:11:00.000Z	mooseman447		yea but i want to just launch xchat and have it join freenode without any interaction
2006-06-17T12:12:00.000Z	witless	mooseman447	it does
2006-06-17T12:12:00.000Z	mooseman447		how?
2006-06-17T12:12:00.000Z	mooseman447		i always need to go to server and then find freenode and then it autojoins the chans
2006-06-17T12:12:00.000Z	witless	mooseman447	press ctrl-S, select the network, click edit, and enter the channels to join in the given space.  next time you start xchat, it will enter those channels
2006-06-17T12:13:00.000Z	mooseman447		brb let me check
2006-06-17T12:14:00.000Z	mooseman447		nope i had to do crtl s and manually hit connect
2006-06-17T12:15:00.000Z	witless	mooseman447	works automatically for me. let me see
2006-06-17T12:15:00.000Z	mooseman447		witless are you using some sorta script?
2006-06-17T12:15:00.000Z	witless	mooseman447	ah, i think you might have to check "skip server list at startup"
2006-06-17T12:15:00.000Z	mooseman447		yea i did try that
2006-06-17T12:16:00.000Z	mooseman447		its odd because a app like this would seem like it would autojoin the network
2006-06-17T12:16:00.000Z	witless	mooseman447	how about "auto connect to this network at startup"
2006-06-17T12:16:00.000Z	mooseman447		where did you find that?!
2006-06-17T12:17:00.000Z	witless		same dialog where you enter the channels to join
2006-06-17T12:17:00.000Z	mooseman447	lol	another obvious mistake i should sleep now.....
2006-06-17T12:17:00.000Z	witless		:-)
2006-06-17T12:18:00.000Z	mooseman447	lol	but now is it possible to launch xchat on boot?
2006-06-17T12:18:00.000Z	witless	mooseman447	i think you can do that in the sessions preferences
