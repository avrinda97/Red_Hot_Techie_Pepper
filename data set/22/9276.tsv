2005-12-29T08:17:00.000Z	MrPrimate	michael	once you have files installed, just make symbolic link into mozilla directory, msg me if you cant figure it out
2005-12-29T08:19:00.000Z	MrPrimate	michael	you will just use apt to install it as anything else
2005-12-29T08:28:00.000Z	MrPrimate	michael	search on google aptitude and synaptic for everything
2005-12-29T09:30:00.000Z	MrPrimate	michael	I don't know anything about ubuntu, but in debian you should just be able to mount it (read-write if you want)
2005-12-29T09:30:00.000Z	MrPrimate	michael	you could mount it to /mnt/xp  for example
2005-12-29T09:30:00.000Z	MrPrimate	michael	msg me if you don't know what i'm talking about
2005-12-29T09:31:00.000Z	MrPrimate	michael	ok, yeah perhaps, was that in nautilus ?
2005-12-29T09:32:00.000Z	MrPrimate	michael	your /etc/fstab has to have your xp partition in it
2005-12-29T09:32:00.000Z	MrPrimate	michael	if you put it in there proper, then you can see it in your system
2005-12-29T09:32:00.000Z	MrPrimate	michael	otherwise you mount it each time to use it
2005-12-29T09:33:00.000Z	MrPrimate	michael	to mount it manually, you would say   mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/xp
2005-12-29T09:33:00.000Z	MrPrimate	michael	you would put the proper mount line in the terminal yes
