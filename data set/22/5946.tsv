2007-11-23T21:18:00.000Z	chazco		Hi... does anyone know if Textmaker works on Linux (via Wine, not the native version)?
2007-11-23T21:19:00.000Z	Pici	chazco	if you're asking about specific application compatibility in wine, check out #winehq and !appdb
2007-12-24T19:31:00.000Z	Pici	chazco	You can use checkinstall (see !checkinstall), but that is only valid for your computer.
2007-12-24T19:31:00.000Z	chazco	Pici	- thanks... want it on several PCs though
2007-12-24T22:04:00.000Z	Pici	chazco	nope.
2007-12-28T19:49:00.000Z	Pici	chazco	/me makes a note of that
2007-12-28T20:54:00.000Z	Pici	chazco	see the private message from ubotu....
2007-12-28T20:54:00.000Z	Pici	chazco	the realplayer codes are some of the restricted codecs you can install.
2007-12-28T20:56:00.000Z	chazco	Pici	- managed to find acopy of the realplayer installer on a backup, will try that and see
2007-12-28T20:56:00.000Z	Pici	chazco	good luck
2007-12-28T20:58:00.000Z	Pici	chazco	I was, and was not aware of that. Noted.
2007-12-28T21:01:00.000Z	chazco	Pici	- it worked :)
2007-12-28T21:01:00.000Z	Pici	chazco	Yay
2008-02-15T00:51:00.000Z	Pici	chazco	sudo touch /forcefsck and then reboot.
2008-02-15T00:55:00.000Z	chazco	Pici	- how can I force a full check on a drive that isnt present at boot time? I dont think its ever been checked :)
2008-02-15T00:55:00.000Z	Pici	chazco	If you unmount it, you can just do a regular fsck on it while the computer is running.
2008-02-15T00:56:00.000Z	chazco	Pici	- Its a truecrypt volume... when I unmount it it ceases the be a device...
2008-02-15T00:56:00.000Z	Pici	chazco	oh.  I'm not really sure how you would go about doing that.
2008-02-15T01:00:00.000Z	chazco	Pici	- I got it to show as /dev/loop0... what fsck command would I use to do as full a check as possible (with progress bar if thats possible)?
2008-06-17T16:42:00.000Z	Pici	chazco	It is.
2009-05-05T21:49:00.000Z	Pici	chazco	They are cnames for each other
2009-05-05T21:50:00.000Z	chazco	Pici	/ grawity - Thats makes it even more odd that irc.freenode.net wont accept the connection then...
