2008-09-22T19:46:00.000Z	baudthief		help... I screwed up my video config somehow, screen updates are EXTREMELY slow. card is a mobility radeon 9700, I tried installing fglrx, and also uninstalling to no avail. dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg crashes out before asking me about video settings
2008-09-22T19:47:00.000Z	legend2440	baudthief	have you tried to enable the ati drivers in  system>admin>hardware drivers?
2008-09-22T19:48:00.000Z	baudthief	legend2440	yeah, its doing the same thing. The menu takes about 3 to 4 seconds to show! I believe it happenned when I experimented with installing XGL
2008-09-22T19:50:00.000Z	legend2440	baudthief	well as a last resort you could try to remove them then reinstall them using  envyng-gtk. its in synaptic
2008-09-22T19:51:00.000Z	baudthief	legend2440	thanks, will give that a shot right away
2008-09-22T19:51:00.000Z	legend2440	baudthief	if you type fglrxinfo in terminal does it say   mesa or  ati?
2008-09-22T19:51:00.000Z	baudthief	legend2440	1 sec, just rebooting it now
2008-09-22T19:53:00.000Z	baudthief	legend2440	nevermind heh, I just removed xserver-xgl, now everythings great!
2008-09-22T19:53:00.000Z	legend2440	baudthief	ok good
2008-09-22T19:55:00.000Z	baudthief	legend2440	I just installed the proprietary driver through the control panel, but fglrx is still telling me its using mesa GLX?
2008-09-22T19:55:00.000Z	baudthief		*fglrxinfo
2008-09-22T19:57:00.000Z	legend2440	baudthief	in xorg.conf   does  Driver    say    "fglrx"  ?
2008-09-22T19:58:00.000Z	baudthief	legend2440	yes
2008-09-22T19:58:00.000Z	baudthief	legend2440	cpanel also says proprietary drivers are "in use"

2008-09-22T20:03:00.000Z	legend2440	baudthief	did you reboot after removing xserver-xgl?
2008-09-22T20:06:00.000Z	baudthief	legend2440	no luck, fglrxinfo still claims mesa is in use
2008-09-22T20:06:00.000Z	legend2440	baudthief	did you reboot after removing xserver-xgl?
2008-09-22T20:07:00.000Z	baudthief	legend2440	yes, but I didn't reboot when adding Option "Composite" to xorg.conf (just restarted X)
2008-09-22T20:07:00.000Z	legend2440	baudthief	that should be all you need to do
2008-09-22T20:08:00.000Z	baudthief		weird o_O
