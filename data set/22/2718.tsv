2009-04-19T17:29:00.000Z	Elob		Heya
2009-04-19T17:29:00.000Z	Elob		So I wanted to re-install python, so I did "sudo apt-get autoremove python"
2009-04-19T17:29:00.000Z	Elob		and it removed everything
2009-04-19T17:29:00.000Z	Elob		Including ubuntu-desktop
2009-04-19T17:30:00.000Z	Elob		So I only have a console back
2009-04-19T17:30:00.000Z	grawity	Elob	So install ubuntu-desktop then?
2009-04-19T17:30:00.000Z	Elob		Now this is fine, running sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop should fix it
2009-04-19T17:30:00.000Z	Elob		But I run a wireless network
2009-04-19T17:30:00.000Z	Elob		It doesnt seem to connect through my wireless network grawity
2009-04-19T17:31:00.000Z	Elob		No, I'm just not sure what command to make it connect
2009-04-19T17:31:00.000Z	Elob		Its just the bare console, with no desktop or GUI
2009-04-19T17:31:00.000Z	Elob		Yeah ActionParsnip, but the ubuntu-desktop has been uninstalled
2009-04-19T17:31:00.000Z	Elob		So I cant figure out how to make it connect to a wireless network through the console
2009-04-19T17:32:00.000Z	Elob		Well I am dual booting on this machine
2009-04-19T17:32:00.000Z	Elob		I know ActionParsnip, but all the UI is gone. I was wondering how to connect to a wireless network to re-download it
2009-04-19T17:32:00.000Z	Elob	ziroday	any other suggestions? To try it I have to restart
2009-04-19T17:33:00.000Z	Elob		So I want to get as many ideas as possible
2009-04-19T17:33:00.000Z	Elob		Yeah there is Raphi974
2009-04-19T17:33:00.000Z	Elob		And no ActionParsnip sorry, not possible
2009-04-19T17:33:00.000Z	Elob		If it were, what would I do?
2009-04-19T17:33:00.000Z	Elob		Would it connect automatically?
2009-04-19T17:34:00.000Z	grawity	Elob	just guessing, but: ifconfig wlan0 up ; iwconfig wlan0 essid YOUR_ESSID ; iwconfig wlan0 key YOUR_KEY ; dhclient wlan0
