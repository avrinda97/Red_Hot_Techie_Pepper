2008-12-01T23:11:00.000Z	pronoy		can anyone please help me with this problem....my sound works fine but the flash plugin in mozilla isn't drawing any sound
2008-12-01T23:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	pronoy	are you using flash 9?
2008-12-01T23:12:00.000Z	pronoy	IndyGunFreak	i don't know....i guess its the latest...how do you check the version
2008-12-01T23:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	pronoy	just go to youtube, play a video and right click it, it should say the version of flash there
2008-12-01T23:14:00.000Z	pronoy	IndyGunFreak	ok here's something i tried watching the same vid in opera......and that works fine
2008-12-01T23:14:00.000Z	pronoy	IndyGunFreak	what is the deal with flash and mozilla
2008-12-01T23:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	pronoy	flash and mozilla are fine, its a pulse-audio issue... again, what version of flash are you using
2008-12-01T23:15:00.000Z	pronoy	IndyGunFreak	ya its cool.......flash 9
2008-12-01T23:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	pronoy	upgrade to flash 10..
2008-12-01T23:16:00.000Z	pronoy	IndyGunFreak	do i need to uninstall flash 9 first...or is there a way to just overwrite
2008-12-01T23:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	pronoy	i don't think you need to uninstall 9, i just went to adobe.com and download flash 10, and follow the instructinos to install it.
2008-12-01T23:18:00.000Z	pronoy	IndyGunFreak	how is 10 working for you? is there any issue with the audio with that version ??
2008-12-01T23:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	pronoy	i've had no problems
2008-12-01T23:20:00.000Z	pronoy	IndyGunFreak	hey it says here 10's released for the 64bit architecture........will it work on x86
2008-12-01T23:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	pronoy	there should be a 32bit file there, cuz i'm using it.
2008-12-01T23:31:00.000Z	pronoy	IndyGunFreak	i removed flash player 9 and i downloaded the .deb file for fp 10 but the plugin's missing in firefox even after installing
2008-12-01T23:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	pronoy	that would e pretty unusual, i've used that .deb numerous times w/ no problem
2008-12-01T23:32:00.000Z	pronoy	IndyGunFreak	i guess you didn't remove the flash 9 befor installing the flash 10.deb ?
2008-12-01T23:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	pronoy	i ddn' even install flash 9.. i just installed 10
2008-12-01T23:33:00.000Z	pronoy	IndyGunFreak	directly using the .deb ? wierd.....i get to install 9 again using the plugin finder service after i installed 10
2008-12-01T23:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	pronoy	yeah that is strange...
2008-12-01T23:35:00.000Z	pronoy	IndyGunFreak	nope no success......the idiot keeps intalling flash 9 after removing 10 !! :D
