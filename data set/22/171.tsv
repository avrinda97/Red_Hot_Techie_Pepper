2012-05-15T11:54:00.000Z	L3top	userprecise	I guess I am asking if your headphones are plugged into a dedicated headphone jack, or the green audio jack on a PC, or if they are USB... or what...  you will also want to crank master up... and scroll all the way right and make sure you arent missing something beyond the mic boost etc. If there are more sliders, they do not appear unless you move right more.
2012-05-15T11:59:00.000Z	userprecise	L3top	i removed them to test the speakers. everything is put into  right spots.  but now when i open alsamixer why is audio generic selected which actually has S/PDIF 00. why is other one not selected
