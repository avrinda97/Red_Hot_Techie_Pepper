2008-07-24T18:59:00.000Z	MrKeuner		hi, why did Ubuntu remove support for /proc/bus/usb/* ? Will I void any warranties :) if I enable it?
2008-07-24T19:00:00.000Z	IdleOne	MrKeuner	Ubuntu comes with absolutely no warranties if I remember correctly
2008-07-24T19:00:00.000Z	MrKeuner	IdleOne	that was the joke part
2008-07-24T19:00:00.000Z	IdleOne	MrKeuner	ahh ok funny :)
2010-05-18T21:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	MrKeuner	mine is in /media/0FA4-1EEA/dists/lucid
2010-05-18T21:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	MrKeuner	obviously your path is different but yeah you found it
2010-05-18T21:27:00.000Z	MrKeuner	IdleOne	yeah
2011-05-23T19:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	MrKeuner	apt-get upgrade
2011-05-23T19:44:00.000Z	MrKeuner	IdleOne	apt-get upgrade also does not update any packages... 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
2011-05-23T19:45:00.000Z	IdleOne	MrKeuner	this is on 10.04 server?
2011-05-23T19:45:00.000Z	IdleOne	MrKeuner	there is a bug with MOTD not being updated
2011-05-23T19:46:00.000Z	MrKeuner	IdleOne	any workarounds?
2011-05-23T19:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	MrKeuner	He doesn't appear to be online right now. I can ask him later if he found a fix.
2011-05-23T19:49:00.000Z	IdleOne	MrKeuner	but essentially MOTD is not being updated.
2011-05-23T19:49:00.000Z	MrKeuner	IdleOne	all right, thank you
2011-05-23T19:49:00.000Z	MrKeuner	IdleOne	I'll try to find the bug report
2011-05-23T19:51:00.000Z	MrKeuner	IdleOne	by the way this system is not server but was server last time I installed 10.04. I have formatted the / partition. using the same /home I used with the server
2011-05-23T19:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	MrKeuner	I am not sure if it affects server only or both server and desktop but my friend had the exact same issue.
2011-05-23T19:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	MrKeuner	might want to ask in #ubuntu-server if anybody has seen this
2011-05-23T19:54:00.000Z	MrKeuner	IdleOne	I was looking at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sysvinit/+bug/659738... And I found this in /etc/motd.tail: 106 packages can be updated. 61 updates are security updates.... :) Somehow it was hardcoded in motd...
2011-05-23T19:55:00.000Z	MrKeuner	IdleOne	modifying /etc/motd.tail seems to work for now. (Unless something appends to it again for some reason)
2011-05-23T19:57:00.000Z	IdleOne	MrKeuner	nice job figuring it out :)
