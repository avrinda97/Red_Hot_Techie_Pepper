2011-05-02T17:17:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	like i said compiz broke even with the startup item i made compiz --replace & in startup
2011-05-02T17:18:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	i tried pulling all the compiz packages out and reinstalling them i get a skewed desktop or it panics or i get strange effects that its not supposed to do (abnormal activity from it that is a pita)
2011-05-02T17:18:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	and i dont really feel like going back to ubuntu 10.10 (since downgrading means really a clean install) i rather keep moving forward instead of backwards
2011-05-02T17:19:00.000Z	hamnegga	c4pt	I would try recompiling my driver manually, since you probably are using a different one with an updated kernel

2011-05-02T17:26:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	cube and rotate cube are working but my open windows like xchat and terminal are missing the very top of the window like where you would grab with the mouse to move the window
2011-05-02T17:27:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	thanks
2011-05-02T17:27:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	now the top of the window is back but i cant physically move the windows around
2011-05-02T17:28:00.000Z	hamnegga	c4pt	think a little, move windows plugin maybe?
2011-05-02T17:29:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	:( ?
2011-05-02T17:29:00.000Z	hamnegga	c4pt	 what?
2011-05-02T17:29:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	selecting move on the window doesnt help either (not in plugins but actually right clicking and selecting move)
2011-05-02T17:30:00.000Z	hamnegga	c4pt	did you enable the move windows plugin?
2011-05-02T17:30:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	i see it
2011-05-02T17:30:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	yes makes sense
2011-05-02T17:30:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	lol
2011-05-02T17:30:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	thanx
2011-05-02T17:31:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	thank you
2011-05-02T17:31:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	ill bbl or bbiab
2011-05-02T17:31:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	i appreciate it thank you!
2011-05-02T17:32:00.000Z	c4pt	hamnegga	i knew compiz did desktop effects but i didnt realize it grabbed control of the entire desktop like that and if its a totally fresh config or a non working config; i didnt realize stuff like that had to be selected since i am used to installing enabling two or three things and usually leaving it the way it is
