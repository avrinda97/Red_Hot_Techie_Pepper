2005-01-08T16:51:00.000Z	broodster		cannot execute binary file
2005-01-08T16:52:00.000Z	Kamion	broodster	I bet the filesystem is mounted noexec
2005-01-08T16:53:00.000Z	Kamion	broodster	mount -o remount,exec <filesystem>
2005-01-08T16:55:00.000Z	Kamion	broodster	type 'df', look down the left-hand column for the best match to the directory you're in
2005-01-09T17:00:00.000Z	Kamion	broodster	type 'head -n 1 jdk-1_5_0_01-nb-4_0-bin-linux-1.bin' and show us the output, please
2005-01-09T17:02:00.000Z	Kamion	broodster	oh so it's actually an executable, not a shell script, hm
2005-01-09T17:03:00.000Z	Kamion	broodster	what happens when you type 'file jdk-1_5_0_01-nb-4_0-bin-linux-1.bin'?
2005-01-09T17:05:00.000Z	Kamion	broodster	I can't remember if amd64 can run statically linked i386 binaries
2005-01-09T17:08:00.000Z	Kamion	broodster	./jre.bin
2005-01-09T17:09:00.000Z	Kamion	broodster	I never thought that you wouldn't have tried that, since crimsun suggested it to you above
2005-01-09T10:15:00.000Z	Kamion	broodster	yeah, the command rm6990 gave you *definitely* should have been >> .bashrc, not > .bashrc
2005-01-09T10:44:00.000Z	Kamion	broodster	er, i386 has a massively greater install base than amd64 at the moment
2005-01-09T10:44:00.000Z	Kamion	broodster	amd64 is only part of what AMD put out
