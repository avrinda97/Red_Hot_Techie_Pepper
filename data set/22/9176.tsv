2005-02-12T06:34:00.000Z	arthur__		I've downloaded Suse LiveEval CD
2005-02-12T06:34:00.000Z	arthur__		hum..
2005-02-12T06:35:00.000Z	arthur__		Suse seemed to be very interesting and robust..
2005-02-12T06:36:00.000Z	arthur__		I wanted to use Debian for its philosophy..
2005-02-12T06:36:00.000Z	arthur__		but never liked it..
2005-02-12T06:36:00.000Z	arthur__		like Woody
2005-02-12T06:36:00.000Z	arthur__		and Sarge..
2005-02-12T06:36:00.000Z	arthur__		I've got Sarge installed here..
2005-02-12T06:37:00.000Z	arthur__		this Ubuntu seems to put in a practice way the Debian's philosophy..
2005-02-12T06:38:00.000Z	arthur__		and how can I upgrade to hoary to run on a laptop?
2005-02-12T06:39:00.000Z	thenuke	arthur__	http://www.ubuntuguide.org/#upgradewartytohoary
2005-02-12T06:42:00.000Z	thenuke	arthur__	:) If I may suggest, you could try damn small linux if you want to get best out of old pc's
2005-02-12T06:42:00.000Z	thenuke	arthur__	www.damnsmalllinux.org .. that uses also fluxbox
2005-02-12T06:44:00.000Z	thenuke	arthur__	sure
2005-02-12T06:46:00.000Z	arthur__	thenuke	but does it run smootly?
2005-02-12T06:47:00.000Z	thenuke	arthur__	nope, there is no root password, and you do not really need it but if you want to, you can have it
2005-02-12T06:47:00.000Z	thenuke	arthur__	on my comps atleast, yes, but I have more memory than you :I I have 64megs
2005-02-12T06:47:00.000Z	thenuke	arthur__	you can try it off the cd, and then install it to HD if you think you like it
2005-02-12T06:48:00.000Z	thenuke	arthur__	I don't know what you mean by maintaining security?  but if you need to do something as a root in ubuntu, you can use sudo <command>  or sudo -s -H to get root shell
2005-02-12T06:49:00.000Z	thenuke	arthur__	obviously ~3GHz / 512MB PC runs a bit faster than DSL on a p100 :)  but it is very usable on these p100 too
2005-02-12T06:50:00.000Z	arthur__	thenuke	I mean an analogy between dsl/p100 and ubuntu/your main pc.
2005-02-12T06:52:00.000Z	thenuke	arthur__	well, I meant that you cant compare ubuntu or something on a highend PC  and some old crap hardware with lightweight os ;)
