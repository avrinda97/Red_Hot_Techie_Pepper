2007-04-01T07:23:00.000Z	ZigZag		got burned on graphix
2007-04-01T07:23:00.000Z	ZigZag		ati radeon express 1100
2007-04-01T07:23:00.000Z	ZigZag		but still..  for 599..  not too bad
2007-04-01T07:24:00.000Z	ZigZag		just a 100 gig
2007-04-01T07:24:00.000Z	ZigZag		missed that part b4 I started typing
2007-04-01T07:25:00.000Z	ZigZag		yeah, this is it..  got edgy on it and had feisty on it...  but dropped feisty
2007-04-01T07:25:00.000Z	ZigZag		have not tried snooze yet
2007-04-01T07:26:00.000Z	ZigZag		(hibernate)
2007-04-01T07:27:00.000Z	ZigZag		(I needed a quick fix *hence the walmart shopping* for a busted LCD on my other notebook
2007-04-01T07:29:00.000Z	ZigZag		it's easier to install Feisty and use it's automount feature, than it is to physically mount that volume in my opinion
2007-04-01T07:29:00.000Z	bruenig	ZigZag	you don't physically mount things
2007-04-01T08:02:00.000Z	bruenig	ZigZag	you aren't on the desktop
2007-04-01T08:03:00.000Z	bruenig	ZigZag	cd ~/Desktop && tar xf mupen64-0.5.tar.bz2
2007-04-01T08:08:00.000Z	bruenig	ZigZag	you don't know how ridiculous that sounds
2007-04-01T08:09:00.000Z	bruenig	ZigZag	right click on the thing and select extract here
2007-04-01T08:10:00.000Z	bruenig	ZigZag	it is already extracted
2007-04-01T08:10:00.000Z	bruenig	ZigZag	that directory that showed up is the extracted tarball
2007-04-01T08:13:00.000Z	bruenig	ZigZag	it is already extracted, like I said
2007-04-01T08:13:00.000Z	bruenig	ZigZag	and unpackaged at mupen64-0.5
2007-04-01T08:23:00.000Z	bruenig	ZigZag	yeah windows users sometimes get confused as to what installing actually means. They click on something and this seemingly official prompt comes up and then magically it is in the menus. All you are really looking at is moving files around.
2007-04-01T10:20:00.000Z	ZigZag	bruenig	is like the ubuntu MVP > in here every night saving ppl from their selves
2007-04-01T10:22:00.000Z	bruenig	ZigZag	right but I am not sure if she has the right repositories enabled, and she won't respond for some reason
