2007-03-22T07:59:00.000Z	lugod		I have a problem right now: fonts are really ugly in Tk applications. I'm getting scaled fixed-size fonts instead of scalable fonts beong used by default for menus, dialog boxes, etc. Any ideas? The problem does not occur on Debian Sarge
2007-03-22T08:00:00.000Z	Toma-	lugod	have you compiled your TK app with 8.5?
2007-03-22T08:01:00.000Z	lugod	Toma-	tk8.4 is the only version of tk I have installed
2007-03-22T08:01:00.000Z	Toma-	lugod	yeh, tk8.4 doesnt support xft so it looks butt-ugly.
2007-03-22T08:02:00.000Z	Toma-	lugod	what tk app are you running? is it amsn?
2007-03-22T08:03:00.000Z	lugod	Toma-	grass 6.2 and own scripts wrtieen in ruby-tk
2007-03-22T08:03:00.000Z	Toma-	lugod	ahh ok. you can find tk/tcl packages of 8.5 and the -dev stuff from google or the forums
2007-03-22T08:06:00.000Z	lugod	Toma-	any way to fix tk8.4 to at least use a decent font by default? with x resources maybe?
2007-03-22T08:12:00.000Z	lugod	Toma-	i;'ve found tcl8.5 packages here: http://3v1n0.tuxfamily.org/dists/edgy/3v1n0/ i'm trying those now
2007-03-22T08:12:00.000Z	Toma-	lugod	i use that repo too. good stuff.
2007-03-22T08:31:00.000Z	lugod	Toma-	is initng an alternative to upstart and sysvinit?
2007-03-22T08:32:00.000Z	Toma-	lugod	yes.
2007-03-22T09:21:00.000Z	lugod	Toma-	i'm trying to compile ruby against tk8.5 now
2007-03-22T09:22:00.000Z	Toma-	lugod	cool :) read all those freindly ./configure --help options for xft and AA and such
2007-03-22T09:23:00.000Z	lugod	Toma-	actually I'm trying to generate a package with apt-get source --build :)
2007-03-22T09:23:00.000Z	Toma-	lugod	oh god :D
2007-03-22T09:24:00.000Z	lugod	Toma-	didn't work :(
2007-03-22T09:25:00.000Z	lugod	Toma-	weird. it was configured using --with-tcl-include=/usr/include/tcl8.5 which is correct
2007-03-22T09:25:00.000Z	lugod	Toma-	guess i will try compiling manually
2007-03-22T09:25:00.000Z	Toma-	lugod	usually best. sometimes the extra options are missing
2007-03-22T09:25:00.000Z	lugod	Toma-	the tk part mysteriously failed to compile (cp: cannot stat `debian/tmp//usr/lib/ruby/1.8/i486-linux/tcltklib.so': No such file or directory)
2007-03-22T09:26:00.000Z	lugod	Toma-	sounds likely
