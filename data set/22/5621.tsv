2007-04-03T05:18:00.000Z	SpeakerMania		Okay, another question...
2007-04-03T05:18:00.000Z	SpeakerMania		Is there any way in this known universe to build a driver for my dial-up modem if it isn't supported?
2007-04-03T05:19:00.000Z	SpeakerMania		Read that. My modem isn't supprted.
2007-04-03T05:19:00.000Z	jrib	SpeakerMania	what modem?
2007-04-03T05:32:00.000Z	jrib	SpeakerMania	your best bet is probably the linmodems page, I think they have a mailing list too
2007-06-13T06:34:00.000Z	jrib	SpeakerMania	try it
2007-06-13T06:34:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	jrib	I am. :) I'm downloading it right now.
2007-06-13T06:34:00.000Z	jrib	SpeakerMania	through APT right?  I think it's ok, but your taste may be different than mine :)
2007-11-17T10:55:00.000Z	jrib	SpeakerMania	cp -a
2007-11-17T10:58:00.000Z	jrib	SpeakerMania	no
2007-11-17T10:58:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	jrib	so just "mv ~/Music/ /media/disk/Music"?
2007-11-17T10:58:00.000Z	jrib	SpeakerMania	well, yes but then you will have /media/disk/Music/Music
2007-11-17T10:59:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	jrib	oh. I just ran "cp -R ~/Music /media/disk/Music" so I will have /media/disk/Music/Music/ when it is finished?
2007-11-18T22:24:00.000Z	jrib	SpeakerMania	did you install the "unrar" package
2007-11-18T22:24:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	jrib	no.
2007-11-18T22:24:00.000Z	jrib	SpeakerMania	you need to
2007-11-18T22:25:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	jrib	so I do sudo apt-get install unrar ?
2007-11-18T22:25:00.000Z	jrib	SpeakerMania	yes as long aas you have enabled universe
2007-11-18T22:25:00.000Z	jrib	SpeakerMania	yes as long aas you have enabled multiverse
2007-11-18T22:25:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	jrib	I don't know what that means, but I'll try it.
2007-11-18T22:26:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	jrib	I got it. Thanks for your help. :) You too, desertc
2007-11-30T06:43:00.000Z	jrib	SpeakerMania	keepvid.com but this isn't really related to ubuntu
