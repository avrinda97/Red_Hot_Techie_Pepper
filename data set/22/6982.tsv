2006-10-20T07:02:00.000Z	jrib	jason	that may just mean no other ubuntu user that has that modem has created a wiki page.  It may still work but you will have to read those docs, and probably google some more to get it to work
2006-10-20T07:03:00.000Z	jason	jrib	I saw some instructions which is like get get headers,recompile kernel,get windows driver and recompile it for ubuntu and such stuff
2006-10-20T07:04:00.000Z	jrib	jason	is there no way to use your modem through ethernet?
2006-10-20T07:05:00.000Z	jrib	jason	hmm you can try searching ubuntuforums.org too.  afaik, you'll have to struggle a bit to get usb dsl to work
2006-10-20T07:07:00.000Z	jrib	jason	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2293 this might help get you started
2008-06-14T20:05:00.000Z	jrib	jason	we like to keep this channel dedicated to ubuntu support only since it is so busy.  Mind moving your discussion over to #ubuntu-offtopic?
2008-06-14T20:07:00.000Z	jrib	jason	what type of stream is it?
2008-06-14T20:13:00.000Z	jason	jrib	the stream is here http://livefooty.doctor-serv.com/
2008-06-14T20:14:00.000Z	jrib	jason	no, there are many streams there.  Which one are you trying to watch?
2008-06-14T20:15:00.000Z	jrib	jason	the ones that are flash, you just use flash
2008-06-15T05:46:00.000Z	jrib	jason	what filesystem is on the partition?
2008-06-15T05:47:00.000Z	jrib	jason	ok, but with what filesystem?
2008-06-15T05:47:00.000Z	jrib	jason	have you mounted it?
2008-06-15T05:48:00.000Z	jrib	jason	you need to use chmod/chown on the mounted location, *not* /dev/blah
2008-06-15T05:49:00.000Z	jrib	jason	huh?  in the terminal
2008-06-15T05:49:00.000Z	jason	jrib	sudo: chmod/chown: command not found
2008-06-15T05:50:00.000Z	jrib	jason	no, by "chmod/chown" I meant: Use the commands chmod and chown appropriately to set the permissions you want (procedure is explained in the link ubottu sent you)
2009-05-24T02:57:00.000Z	jrib	jason	why?
