2010-01-26T08:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rumpsy	wiredmind_ four or so bots here as well, and  they are also part of the number, plus I expect not everyone in here uses Ubuntu

2010-05-22T06:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rumpsy	Why do you think that?
2010-05-22T06:46:00.000Z	rumpsy	sebsebseb	the steps for mounting iso is not working
2010-05-22T06:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rumpsy	uhmm you don't upgrade using the ISO
2010-05-22T06:46:00.000Z	rumpsy	sebsebseb	i'm not getting the prompt to upgrade
2010-05-22T06:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rumpsy	ok, but nothing is wrong with Hardy untill  end of April next year, on the  desktop
2010-05-22T06:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rumpsy	Hardy is still supported on the desktop untill then
2010-05-22T06:47:00.000Z	rumpsy	sebsebseb	its okay, but i want to upgrade :( . . .
2010-05-22T06:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rumpsy	maybe do a clean install,  so you get Ext4 file system and Grub 2 by default, don't really need either though.
2010-05-22T06:48:00.000Z	rumpsy	sebsebseb	clean install ! , omg what about my datas
2010-05-22T06:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rumpsy	your meant to be backing up data that you want to keep for ages,  some where else anyway, since hard disks can just fail
2010-05-22T06:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rumpsy	you can't use the desktop cd to upgrade
