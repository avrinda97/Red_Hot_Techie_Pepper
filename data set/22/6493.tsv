2006-10-17T05:47:00.000Z	deadcoder		/dev/hda8 /mnt/hda8 vfat noauto,user,exec,umask=011 0 0
2006-10-17T05:47:00.000Z	deadcoder		what does that line state to anyone here?
2006-10-17T05:48:00.000Z	deadcoder		i am having a problem, its a bug or its my understanding of fstab and mount ..... if i could know which one, i would feel a lot better
2006-10-17T05:50:00.000Z	deadcoder		well, i am trying to be make a ubuntu based distrubtion use a partition in a certain manner
2006-10-17T05:50:00.000Z	deadcoder		but it seems to be acting wierd, so i am trying to get someone to tell me what my line in fstab means, to see if i have the same impression that they do
2006-10-17T05:50:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	what about it?
2006-10-17T05:50:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	its a windows partition
2006-10-17T05:51:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	i usualy just say defaults instead of noauto,user,exec
2006-10-17T05:51:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	it might be the umask, whats the bug?
2006-10-17T05:52:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	yeah...
2006-10-17T05:52:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	you sure its not ntfs?
2006-10-17T05:53:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	so set it to 00
2006-10-17T05:54:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	so whats wrong with it?
2006-10-17T05:55:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	i dont use umask
2006-10-17T05:58:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	just say: /dev/hda8 /mnt/hda8 vfat defaults 0 0
2006-10-17T06:01:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	or you could go with linux only
2006-10-17T06:02:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	just say: /dev/hda8 /mnt/hda8 vfat defaults 0 0, that might work
2006-10-17T06:04:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	so?
2006-10-17T06:06:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	yeah
2006-10-17T06:07:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	no, used linux 3< years
2006-10-17T06:09:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	i still dont understand what your trying to do
2006-10-17T06:14:00.000Z	iamtheric	deadcoder	makes sense
