2009-01-06T19:28:00.000Z	cospelero	Jickel	it is all set to autodetect
2009-01-06T19:29:00.000Z	cospelero	Jickel	I dont know.  I tried the hardware manager, and the sound was working okk., I heard the beep
2009-01-06T19:30:00.000Z	Jickel	cospelero	Oh, do you hear beeps in the sound dialogue when hitting the Test buttons?
2009-01-06T19:30:00.000Z	cospelero	Jickel	yes
2009-01-06T19:30:00.000Z	cospelero	Jickel	yes
2009-01-06T19:31:00.000Z	Jickel	cospelero	Actually I think I ran into something similar.. the sound volume was just muted somewhere are something... do you have the sound turned up in the volume control up on the top right of the screen? Is there any special app you're not getting sound in?
2009-01-06T19:32:00.000Z	cospelero	Jickel	I have read posts saying the same thing, I dont know where mute is, yes, I have my sound turned all the way up.  I have only heard sound on the hardware manager test.  I dont hear it when I play videos
2009-01-06T19:33:00.000Z	Jickel	cospelero	ugh I can't remember how I solved it, but it was some stupid little thing I had overlooked...
2009-01-06T19:34:00.000Z	cospelero	Jickel	is there a place Im not looking that has a mute button?
2009-01-06T19:35:00.000Z	Jickel	cospelero	try right clicking on the volume control, you can open a separate volume control window and stuff form there
2009-01-06T19:36:00.000Z	cospelero	Jickel	I think that was it. Let me try and I will let you know
2009-01-06T19:36:00.000Z	Jickel	cospelero	Now I remember what it was for me! Right click on the volume control and open the volume control window. There might be a switches tab there
2009-01-06T19:37:00.000Z	Jickel	cospelero	try changing the Audigyu Analog/Digital Output Jack checkbox there, if you have one
2009-01-06T19:39:00.000Z	cospelero	Jickel	I was able to unmute 3 different channels, but I still get no sound on YouTube
2009-01-06T19:41:00.000Z	cospelero	Jickel	I wouldnt have to reboot, would I?
2009-01-06T19:44:00.000Z	cospelero	Jickel	no switches tab, only one tab, reproduction
2009-01-06T19:46:00.000Z	Jickel	cospelero	Alright, I guess its sound card specific. If sound is working in other apps, try ActionParsnip s solution above
2009-01-06T19:49:00.000Z	cospelero	Jickel	what is another application I can try sound in?  Can you send me a sound here?
2009-01-06T19:49:00.000Z	cospelero	Jickel	I opened the links ActionsParsnips sent
2009-01-06T19:52:00.000Z	Jickel	cospelero	Try opening pidgin instant messenger, then opening preferences and going to the sounds tab. You can preview sounds there, tho they're quite soft
2009-01-06T19:55:00.000Z	cospelero	Jickel	no sound there
