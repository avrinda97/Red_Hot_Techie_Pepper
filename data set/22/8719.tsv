2005-06-20T12:08:00.000Z	reka	Fabian	right-click ->adjust?
2005-06-20T12:10:00.000Z	Fabian	reka	as far as i can see everythings deactivated.... but it still keeps syncronising at the startup
2005-06-20T12:12:00.000Z	reka	Fabian	hmm.  i'm not certain if this is actually what you want, but you could do this to disable it: http://ubuntuguide.org/#synchronizingclocktooslow
2005-06-20T12:12:00.000Z	reka	Fabian	it might also be that you've enabled UTC in the clock prefs.
2005-06-20T12:13:00.000Z	reka	Fabian	disregard my last comment :-) UTC is unix time
2005-06-20T12:16:00.000Z	Fabian	reka	what exactly disables "sudo chmod -x /etc/init.d/service_name" ???? In the document you pointed out, it just sais "disable boot-up service"
2005-06-20T12:17:00.000Z	reka	Fabian	i'd first see if you've enabled UTC in the clock's prefs.
2005-06-20T12:17:00.000Z	Fabian	reka	nope i haven't
2005-06-20T12:17:00.000Z	reka	Fabian	topic title: "Synchronizing clock to ntp.ubuntulinux.org"
2005-06-20T12:23:00.000Z	Fabian	reka	there is no service_name in my /etc/init.d
2005-06-20T12:24:00.000Z	reka	Fabian	see the topic links before that line? http://ubuntuguide.org/#permanentlydisableenableboot-upservices
2005-06-20T12:25:00.000Z	reka	Fabian	actually, you might want to ask Seveas.  i'm not completely sure if that will fix your prob.
2005-06-20T12:25:00.000Z	Fabian	reka	yep see that one! can't chmod it if there is no such thing as /etc/init.d/service_name
2005-06-20T12:26:00.000Z	reka	Fabian	you replace "service_name" with the service you are trying to disable. in this case, it's "ntpdate"
2005-06-20T12:26:00.000Z	Fabian	reka	ah i see! :D
2005-06-20T12:26:00.000Z	reka	Fabian	you've just learnt the shortcomings of ubguide!
2005-06-20T12:27:00.000Z	Fabian	reka	i reckon I'm pretty fast learning! I got ubuntu since three days and never used linux before! :D
