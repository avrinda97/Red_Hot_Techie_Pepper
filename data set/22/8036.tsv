2005-10-31T11:00:00.000Z	Splinter		hi all
2005-10-31T11:00:00.000Z	Splinter		I have a question regarding trying to connect to the internet, basically I can log into my router and see my settings etc... but I can not browse
2005-10-31T11:01:00.000Z	linkd	Splinter	see if u can ping google.com or something
2005-10-31T11:03:00.000Z	linkd	Splinter	my advice when u go back, first try to ping google.com, then try and ping a known ip. (like resolve google.com first and write it down) see if either of those work
2005-10-31T11:03:00.000Z	Splinter	linkd	if it does now work how should i move on from there?
2005-10-31T11:04:00.000Z	linkd	Splinter	it depends on if both of those work or not
2005-10-31T11:04:00.000Z	Splinter	linkd	i am on dhcp mode not static ip, will this make a difference, how would i set it to make connection in dhcp?
2005-10-31T11:04:00.000Z	Splinter	linkd	i tried setting it to ivp4
2005-10-31T11:05:00.000Z	linkd	Splinter	does ur router recognise ur machine and give a listed ip address for it?
2005-10-31T11:05:00.000Z	Splinter	linkd	yeah ican login to my router and it shows me ip address etc
2005-10-31T11:06:00.000Z	linkd	Splinter	then u already have an ip do it wont be that
2005-10-31T11:07:00.000Z	Splinter	linkd	do i have to set up anything from within any of ubuntu;s menus?
2005-10-31T11:07:00.000Z	Splinter	linkd	as its not auto detecting it
2005-10-31T11:07:00.000Z	linkd	Splinter	auto detecting what?
2005-10-31T11:07:00.000Z	Splinter	linkd	my connection
2005-10-31T11:08:00.000Z	linkd	Splinter	i thought u said u could connect to ur router?
2005-10-31T11:08:00.000Z	Splinter	linkd	i can
2005-10-31T11:09:00.000Z	Splinter	linkd	but how come i cant not browse?
2005-10-31T11:09:00.000Z	linkd	Splinter	well i cant really help you until u know the results of those pings
2005-10-31T11:09:00.000Z	Splinter	linkd	: ill be back in a wee bit
2005-10-31T11:09:00.000Z	linkd	Splinter	if you can ping ips but not domains check out ur /etc/resove.conf
2005-10-31T11:35:00.000Z	Splinter	linkd	even my router cant ping
