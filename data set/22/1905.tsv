2009-12-01T00:59:00.000Z	Delano-240696195		I can't log into my gnome desktop. All the bars are gone. Alt+F2 doesn't work. Removing and reinstalling gnome doesn't work. This is the 3rd time it's happened to me on 3 seperate installations. What the **** is going on, besides GNOME being the biggest piece of rubbish ever?
2009-12-01T01:01:00.000Z	Delano-240696195		Even Windows doesn't have stupid bugs like that, armornick
2009-12-01T01:03:00.000Z	Delano-240696195		So, any idea how I can fix it?
2009-12-01T01:05:00.000Z	Delano-240696195		Linux is a cult
2009-12-01T01:07:00.000Z	Delano-240696195		I'm in KDE now
2009-12-01T01:07:00.000Z	Delano-240696195		But that's not the point
2009-12-01T01:08:00.000Z	Delano-240696195		You can't advertise Ubuntu as a "solid" OS when even its default GUI is riddled with bugs
2009-12-01T01:09:00.000Z	Delano-240696195		I AM asking for help
2009-12-01T01:09:00.000Z	Delano-240696195		How do I fix it?
