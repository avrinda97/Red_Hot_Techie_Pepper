2009-10-10T05:01:00.000Z	skylar_		Another stupid question due to some tinkering I accidentally removed the wireless network monitor from the bar, and I can't find it in the add to panel section
2009-10-10T05:02:00.000Z	skylar_		huh ?
2009-10-10T05:03:00.000Z	fccf	skylar_	pkill gnome-panel ... should reset it ... it technically supposed to be there
2009-10-10T05:04:00.000Z	skylar_	fccf	sorry I have no idea what you even mean by pkill, I've been on ubuntu for a maximum of 20 minutes, but eventually I'll figure it out
2009-10-10T05:05:00.000Z	fccf	skylar_	 open a terminal .. Applications>Accessories>Terminal ... type ... pkill gnome-panel >enter

2009-10-10T05:08:00.000Z	fccf	skylar_	give me a few minutes and I will see if I can help you get it working again .. please put my name at the beginning when speaking with me
2009-10-10T05:09:00.000Z	fccf		Goto System>Administration>Network, .. see what we get there
2009-10-10T05:09:00.000Z	fccf	skylar_	^^^^ duoh
2009-10-10T05:10:00.000Z	skylar_	fccf	cool will do.  No worries or anything I typically learn by screwing things up and having to fix them  lol
2009-10-10T05:11:00.000Z	fccf	skylar_	and sometimes we have to break something to get it to work ... so if necessarry you may want to come here and ask questions, or discribe what is going on so that we may better assist you
2009-10-10T05:11:00.000Z	skylar_	fccf	 there is no "network" only network tools.
2009-10-10T05:12:00.000Z	skylar_		Shows devices, traceroute, portscan ect
2009-10-10T05:14:00.000Z	fccf	skylar_	run sudo network-admin ... in your terminal
2009-10-10T05:16:00.000Z	skylar_	fccf	command not found, ( I tried twice, I found this on ubuntu forums worth trying - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=241889
2009-10-10T05:17:00.000Z	skylar_	fccf	My bad I already looked in the add panel section for network monitor
