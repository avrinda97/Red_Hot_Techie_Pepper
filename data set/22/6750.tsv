2007-04-28T16:25:00.000Z	ciga		anyone knows how to boot up with kernel 2.4 on ubuntu?
2007-04-28T16:26:00.000Z	ciga		zcat[1] : I have edgy.
2007-04-28T16:26:00.000Z	kevi1	ciga	1) install a 2.4 kernel, 2) make sure its in you menul.lst 3) reinstall grub 4) reboot 5) choose the right kernel
2007-04-28T16:28:00.000Z	kevi1	ciga	does it showup in the menu when you boot?
2007-04-28T16:28:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	yup
2007-04-28T16:29:00.000Z	kevi1	ciga	so the ubuntu folks didnt want you to install it because the current system has initramfs which was not on 2.4. You are on your own on that.
2007-04-28T16:30:00.000Z	kevi1	ciga	what exactly NEEDS a 2.4 kernel?
2007-04-28T16:31:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	having 2.4.27-2-686 in the official distro is only a trap then? :)
2007-04-28T16:31:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	performance.
2007-04-28T16:31:00.000Z	kevi1	ciga	Im sure if you ask the developers, they would disagree with you on that.
2007-04-28T16:32:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	I have an old box that might work better with 2.4
2007-04-28T16:32:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	I used to have 2.4 on debian. I want to give it a try.
2007-04-28T16:33:00.000Z	kevi1	ciga	what are you using this old server for?
2007-04-28T16:33:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	gw/fw/mail/smb
2007-04-28T16:34:00.000Z	kevi1	ciga	its not a P I or P II is it?
2007-04-28T16:34:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	no
2007-04-28T16:36:00.000Z	kevi1	ciga	most folks would not run an xserver on such a box.
2007-04-28T16:37:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	I would not argue with that :)
2007-04-28T16:37:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	and I did not run X there :)
2007-04-28T16:39:00.000Z	kevi1	ciga	maybe you can run dsl, puppy or vector linxu, debian sarge, or the server version of ubuntu.
2007-04-28T16:39:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	I have the server version of ubuntu
2007-04-28T16:40:00.000Z	ciga	kevi1	my desktop box has kubuntu
