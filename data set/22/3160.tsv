2008-11-22T10:42:00.000Z	alkero		Hello. I have Debian Etch system with standard out-of-box PAM auth and a Dovecot imapd on it. I need PAM to successfully authentify a user "user" if he logs in as "user" or as "user@somedomain" or as "user@whateverelse", with same password, UID and home directory. How can I?
2008-11-22T10:42:00.000Z	alkero		(done my googling homework already)
2008-11-22T10:43:00.000Z	root______	alkero	is there a reason you are asking debian questions in #ubuntu ?
2008-11-22T10:44:00.000Z	alkero	root______	yes, unfortunatly. nobody answers on debian and general linux channels
2008-11-22T10:45:00.000Z	root______	alkero	ok.    well good luck with it here.   that's a little deeper than this channel normally gets.
2008-11-22T10:46:00.000Z	alkero	root______	after several hours googling, hope still dies last (:
2008-11-22T10:48:00.000Z	root______	alkero	understood.     wish i could help with that. but i have never setup a mail server and am all but network illiterate anyway.
2008-11-22T10:49:00.000Z	alkero	root______	i came to conclusion tha it can't be done with dovecot's resources, so it became a general PAM question
2008-11-22T10:51:00.000Z	alkero	root______	it is possible, but the other mail servers will think u're a spammer, the use to have dynamic IP's in blacklists
2008-11-22T10:51:00.000Z	alkero	root______	use gmail of web hosting server as "smarthost" to relay your mails
2008-11-22T10:52:00.000Z	root______	alkero	would i need an account on gmail for that ?
2008-11-22T10:52:00.000Z	alkero	root______	sure you do
2008-11-22T10:54:00.000Z	alkero	root______	btw, they provably have a limit on how many mails you can send in a hour. so if you plan to do a mailing list broadcast, better use a web hosting. If you try to spam, they will ban you soon
2008-11-22T10:54:00.000Z	root______	alkero	yeah spam is not the plan
2008-11-22T10:55:00.000Z	alkero	root______	"smarthost" and "relay" are your keywords then.
2008-11-22T10:56:00.000Z	root______	alkero	ok.  thanks.   /me goes to read up
2008-11-22T10:56:00.000Z	alkero	root______	welcome
2008-11-22T11:53:00.000Z	alkero	root______	/sys appera in /etc/mtab but not really mounted?
2008-11-22T11:53:00.000Z	root______	alkero	/etc/mtab is a link to /proc/mounts
2008-11-22T11:56:00.000Z	alkero	root______	not in my system... maybe that's why you get the error?
2008-11-22T11:57:00.000Z	root______	alkero	i get the error because the system thinks that /sys (non-existant dir)   is mounted...
