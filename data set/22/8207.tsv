2006-02-28T07:57:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	cas	i was under the impression there were errors, usually it says it when its correctly finish
2006-02-28T07:57:00.000Z	cas	B_166-ER-X	no, it is the other way around with make. I't fine unless it gives you an error ;)

2006-02-28T08:00:00.000Z	cas	B_166-ER-X	did you `make install` it?
2006-02-28T08:01:00.000Z	cas	B_166-ER-X	`cd src && ./gtkpod` and see if that runs

2006-02-28T08:04:00.000Z	cas	B_166-ER-X	are you in your dir where you typed make??
2006-02-28T08:05:00.000Z	cas	B_166-ER-X	cd /home/oli/gtkpod-0.99.2/src && ./gtkpod
2006-02-28T08:07:00.000Z	cas	B_166-ER-X	ah excuse me, it did installed it but it seems you're missing some libs
2006-02-28T08:08:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	cas	how do i know wich
2006-02-28T08:09:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	cas	how can i know 'wich' libs it needs ?
2006-02-28T08:10:00.000Z	cas	B_166-ER-X	I never used that software but it looks like libgpod
2006-02-28T08:11:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	cas	i have libgpod 1.4 :\
2006-02-28T08:11:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	cas	. compiled it last night
2006-02-28T08:14:00.000Z	cas	B_166-ER-X	did you also installed it? and don't you have official debs installed? they could be bothering each other
2006-02-28T08:14:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	cas	i deleted my old libgpod , then recompiled it, and make install, it.
2006-02-28T08:16:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	cas	command not found !?
2006-02-28T08:17:00.000Z	cas	B_166-ER-X	what command? most libs don't have commands
2006-02-28T08:18:00.000Z	cas	B_166-ER-X	you need to install it. _jason gave you a better way then make install, this make a deb for you wich you can install afterwards with dpkg -i package.deb
2006-02-28T08:32:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	cas	, im not sure to see how can checkinstall help me... it just build a .deb
