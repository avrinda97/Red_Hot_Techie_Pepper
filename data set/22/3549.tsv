2008-10-01T23:25:00.000Z	webfarmer		can anyone help me I'm trying to change the owner of my folder
2008-10-01T23:25:00.000Z	airtonix	webfarmer	have a look at using chmod
2008-10-01T23:25:00.000Z	webfarmer	airtonix	tried that
2008-10-01T23:25:00.000Z	webfarmer	airtonix	 chmod 777 folderName *
2008-10-01T23:26:00.000Z	airtonix	webfarmer	woops i meant 'chown'
2008-10-01T23:26:00.000Z	webfarmer	airtonix	whats chown - do I write it chown folderName?
2008-10-01T23:26:00.000Z	airtonix	webfarmer	in the terminal try this for lots of info : man chown
2008-10-01T23:27:00.000Z	airtonix	webfarmer	its short for change owner
2008-10-01T23:29:00.000Z	webfarmer	airtonix	ok so I went into my folder and typed: chown webfarmer:webfarmer
2008-10-01T23:30:00.000Z	airtonix	webfarmer	$chown user:group target
2008-10-01T23:31:00.000Z	webfarmer	airtonix	 says - bash command not found
2008-10-01T23:32:00.000Z	airtonix	webfarmer	have a read of this : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions
2008-10-01T23:48:00.000Z	webfarmer	airtonix	okay so how do I use this chown thing:"chown webfarmer webfarmer" inside a folder?
2008-10-01T23:49:00.000Z	airtonix	webfarmer	ok for example your in a folder called stuff...
2008-10-01T23:50:00.000Z	airtonix	webfarmer	and you want to make it owned by yourself...but its currently owned by root. or some other user like the webserver (www-data)
2008-10-01T23:51:00.000Z	airtonix	webfarmer	one sec verifying the command i'll give you
2008-10-01T23:51:00.000Z	webfarmer	airtonix	yea\
2008-10-01T23:53:00.000Z	airtonix	webfarmer	ok you would make that folder called stuff yours by using this (providing your currently inside it) : sudo chown webfarmer:webfarmer ./
2008-10-01T23:53:00.000Z	airtonix	webfarmer	but lets say there is files and folders already inside it owned by the www-data user....
2008-10-01T23:54:00.000Z	airtonix	webfarmer	you can recursively take ownership with : sudo chown webfarmer:webfarmer ./ -r
2008-10-01T23:56:00.000Z	airtonix	webfarmer	so i have been corrected that the recursive switch is -R not -r
2008-10-01T23:57:00.000Z	airtonix	webfarmer	but honestly on a live webserver, you wouldnt change ownership of the webserver files...instead you would insert yourself in to the www-data user group
