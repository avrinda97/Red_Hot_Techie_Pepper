2005-03-12T14:01:00.000Z	findeton		ahm let me try. I'm trying to do this in my brother's machine. it seems that he mounted the cd in gnome. gnome was becaming slower and slower and he switched to kde and now we're trying to umount it right from kde with the umount command
2005-03-12T14:02:00.000Z	findeton		umount: /media/cdrom0: device is busy
2005-03-12T14:02:00.000Z	findeton		umount: /media/cdrom0: device is busy
2005-03-12T14:03:00.000Z	findeton		gnome-volume-manager
2005-03-12T14:03:00.000Z	findeton		** (gnome-volume-manager:26779): WARNING **: manager.c/1230: already running?
2005-03-12T14:03:00.000Z	findeton		should I kill the process?
2005-03-12T14:04:00.000Z	findeton		ok let's try
2005-03-12T14:06:00.000Z	findeton		bah, no luck. the device is still "busy"
2005-03-12T14:06:00.000Z	lavigj	findeton	shoot, not sure then
2005-03-12T13:53:00.000Z	lavigj	findeton	if any window is open to that, you won't be able to
2005-03-12T13:55:00.000Z	findeton	lavigj	no one opened. but I forgot to mention that I'm using kde (gnome is inexplicably slow)
2005-03-12T13:55:00.000Z	lavigj	findeton	hmm. not sure theyn
2005-03-12T13:56:00.000Z	findeton	lavigj	ehm, I'm curious, why doesn't ubuntu use something like automount by default or something?
2005-03-12T13:57:00.000Z	lavigj	findeton	I thought it did, but I am very new to ubuntu and even linux in general :)
2005-03-12T13:59:00.000Z	findeton	lavigj	ah ok thanks anyway =)
2005-03-12T14:00:00.000Z	lavigj	findeton	is there a particular error message you get when you try to unmount it?
2005-03-12T14:02:00.000Z	findeton	lavigj	umount /media/cdrom0
2005-03-12T14:02:00.000Z	lavigj	findeton	it might be because of that gnome thing. for whatever reason, the system thinks that's in use
2005-03-12T14:03:00.000Z	lavigj	findeton	I am not sure if you can for umount something
2005-03-12T14:03:00.000Z	findeton	lavigj	in fact this is what I get when I try to launch gnome-volume-manager from the cmd:
2005-03-12T14:04:00.000Z	lavigj	findeton	take this with a big grain of salt, but if you are in KDE I don't see where the gnome file manager should matter much
2005-03-12T14:04:00.000Z	lavigj	findeton	you can probably kill it and then unmount
