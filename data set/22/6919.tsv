2007-03-16T12:40:00.000Z	bassir		Hi all. When I open Synaptic I get the following error:
2007-03-16T12:40:00.000Z	bassir		When I open synaptic I get :E: The package virtualbox needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.
2007-03-16T12:40:00.000Z	bassir		E: Internal error opening cache (1). Please report.
2007-03-16T12:42:00.000Z	bassir		Is there a linux distribution that is actually easy enough to install/uninstall things in?
2007-03-16T12:43:00.000Z	bassir		<ubotu>, too bad I can't open Synaptic, I get this:E: The package virtualbox needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.
2007-03-16T12:43:00.000Z	bassir		E: Internal error opening cache (1). Please report.
2007-03-16T12:45:00.000Z	bassir		Is there a way to uninstall Virtualbox?
2007-03-16T12:45:00.000Z	bassir		If I installed Virtual box via command line how would I go about uninstalling it
2007-03-16T12:45:00.000Z	bassir		Yes
2007-03-16T12:45:00.000Z	finalbeta	bassir	but that's a weird error, I don't know that package
2007-03-16T12:45:00.000Z	finalbeta	bassir	sudo aptitude remove packagename
2007-03-16T12:46:00.000Z	finalbeta	bassir	wine , but that one works good for some apps.
2007-03-16T13:11:00.000Z	finalbeta	bassir	the question has been answered 15 times now.
2007-03-16T13:15:00.000Z	finalbeta	bassir	the virtualbox package is known by nobody here, you can try !launchpad for a support request, you might even try to reinstall synaptic itself, from the commandline sudo aptitude reinstall --purge synaptic
2007-03-16T13:18:00.000Z	finalbeta	bassir	that error is weird, nobody know what the virtualbox package is?
2007-03-16T13:20:00.000Z	finalbeta	bassir	but the install never worked?
2007-03-16T13:21:00.000Z	finalbeta	bassir	try completing the install first, sudo aptitude install --force virtualbox
2007-03-16T13:26:00.000Z	finalbeta	bassir	"sudo apt-get install --force-yes virtualbox"
2007-03-16T13:28:00.000Z	finalbeta	bassir	status report?
2007-03-16T13:30:00.000Z	finalbeta	bassir	no idea, try this  sudo apt-get install -f virtualbox and then I don't know :'
2007-03-16T13:37:00.000Z	finalbeta	bassir	it's a nasty error, google shows some possible solutions, but they are advanced, open a support request on launchpad, and add the output of the commands and the commands self we made you run.
2007-03-16T13:37:00.000Z	finalbeta	bassir	something in the virtualbox package is really wrong. You installed it from somewhere nasty?
