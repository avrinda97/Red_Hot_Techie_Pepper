2012-01-16T18:56:00.000Z	shadowcry		Hi, I am a Mint user and in switching to Ubuntu 11.10 Desktop any advice?
2012-01-16T18:56:00.000Z	theadmin	shadowcry	Honestly? Don't switch. If you plan to switch anyway, well, you should get used to the Unity desktop.
2012-01-16T18:57:00.000Z	shadowcry	theadmin	Why not wsith?
2012-01-16T18:57:00.000Z	shadowcry	theadmin	I am switching _from_ Mint 12 _to_ Ubuntu 11.10
2012-01-16T18:57:00.000Z	theadmin	shadowcry	It's offtopic here, but basically, Ubuntu's current desktop (Unity) is hated by many people
2012-01-16T18:58:00.000Z	theadmin	shadowcry	I suggest you use Xubuntu, honestly, it's my favorite *buntu edition personally
2012-01-16T18:59:00.000Z	theadmin	shadowcry	Latest

2012-01-16T19:03:00.000Z	shadowcry	theadmin	such as the software centre, music player thingy etc
2012-01-16T19:03:00.000Z	theadmin	shadowcry	Yeah, nowadays even more (due to Unity still being in development and not very powerful)
