2006-05-21T07:34:00.000Z	hou5ton		so ... as I understand it ... in /etc/apt/sources.lst, everywhere it says "breezy" ... like in "breezy-backports" ... I change it to "dapper-backports"  ... correct?
2006-05-21T07:35:00.000Z	Flannel	hou5ton	there are no dapper backports, yet.  so, comment those lines out.  But yeah, all the breezys become dappers.
2006-05-21T07:36:00.000Z	hou5ton	Flannel	 ok ... that leaves security, multiverse and universe ... sound right?
2008-01-07T05:28:00.000Z	Flannel	hou5ton	When you try and play a media file you don't have the codec for, it prompts you to install the proper codec
2008-01-07T05:29:00.000Z	hou5ton	Flannel	are the codecs readily available?
2008-01-07T05:29:00.000Z	Flannel	hou5ton	They always have been, yes
2008-07-28T05:01:00.000Z	Flannel	hou5ton	There won't be anything in the /opt folder currently.  As for the unavailable, that's odd.
2008-07-28T04:57:00.000Z	Flannel	hou5ton	What are you installing?
2008-07-28T04:57:00.000Z	hou5ton	Flannel	 wacom tablet app
2008-07-28T04:57:00.000Z	Flannel	hou5ton	Does it look like all the stuff belongsin the same folders?
2008-07-28T04:57:00.000Z	Flannel	hou5ton	/opt or /usr/local/*
2008-07-28T05:03:00.000Z	hou5ton	Flannel	 that was just using one particular file manager .. gentoo
2008-07-28T05:03:00.000Z	Flannel	hou5ton	gentoo isn't a file manager.
2008-07-28T05:03:00.000Z	hou5ton	Flannel	 what is it?
2008-07-28T05:04:00.000Z	Flannel	hou5ton	A linux distribution, just like Ubuntu
2008-07-28T05:04:00.000Z	hou5ton	Flannel	 no ... there is a gentoo file manager too
2008-07-28T05:04:00.000Z	hou5ton	Flannel	 it's in Synaptic
2008-07-28T05:04:00.000Z	Flannel	hou5ton	Like midnight commander
2008-07-28T05:07:00.000Z	hou5ton	Flannel	 I don't see Midnight Commander in Synaptic ... but there is Gnome-Commander ... I guess it's about the same thing
2008-07-28T05:08:00.000Z	Flannel	hou5ton	"mc" is the package name
2008-07-28T05:08:00.000Z	hou5ton	Flannel	 much difference?
2008-07-28T05:08:00.000Z	Flannel	hou5ton	mc is ncurses
