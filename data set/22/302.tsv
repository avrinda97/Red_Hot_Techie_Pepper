2012-01-14T19:13:00.000Z	Masters		hey guys
2012-01-14T19:13:00.000Z	Masters		i need some help
2012-01-14T19:13:00.000Z	Masters		I was trying out the fingerprint scanner but it caused problems during the screen lock
2012-01-14T19:14:00.000Z	Masters		so I went back into the common-auth file and removed the lines I added
2012-01-14T19:14:00.000Z	Masters		now it won't let me log in
2012-01-14T19:14:00.000Z	Masters		does anyone know the default root password?
2012-01-14T19:15:00.000Z	Masters		I tried leaving the password blank when logging in as root but still nothing
2012-01-14T19:15:00.000Z	Masters		there isn't one what?
2012-01-14T19:15:00.000Z	wingot	Masters	There is no root password.
2012-01-14T19:16:00.000Z	wingot	Masters	What's the use case where you need to login as root?
2012-01-14T19:16:00.000Z	wingot	Masters	Oh, can't login.
2012-01-14T19:17:00.000Z	wingot	Masters	Grab your install disk, open up a live cd and then ... what is it, chsomething to get into a shell of your system.
2012-01-14T19:20:00.000Z	wingot	Masters	Live CD (install disk works), chroot into your environment, do a password reset on your account.
2012-01-14T19:21:00.000Z	wingot	Masters	To be fair if you'd gone into Windows and fiddled with SAM you'd have the same problems ;)
2012-01-14T19:21:00.000Z	wingot	Masters	So you removed those two lines from the pam.d/common-auth file?
2012-01-14T19:24:00.000Z	wingot	Masters	But yeah, my advice is what I said above, should fix it. If it's still not working after a pass reset then something else is wrong, but the livecd/chroot will still allow you to investigate and fix without having to reinstall
2012-01-14T19:26:00.000Z	wingot	Masters	x would have been the correct number :P
2012-01-14T20:02:00.000Z	Masters	wingot	you rock
2012-01-14T20:03:00.000Z	wingot	Masters	Glad I could help. Hope you get the fingerprint stuff figured out as well.
2012-01-14T20:05:00.000Z	wingot	Masters	Yeah, and the fault we just fixed is why it wouldn't accept the password back then as well ;)
2012-01-14T20:23:00.000Z	wingot	Masters	Have fun.
2012-01-14T20:31:00.000Z	wingot	Masters	Sorry. Yeah, no idea why it's hanging now, but you've fixed the password auth ;)
