2010-01-13T04:22:00.000Z	argued	Pelo	I guess it was ment for me - tnx, but I cant find the 2.6.32 kernel in synaptic .. it is located @ kernel-ppa/mainline/ as .deb files
2010-01-13T04:25:00.000Z	argued	Pelo	I have issues with transfer speed copying backups and such since 2-3 weeks back, same as many others out there... would you recommend an older version?
2010-01-13T04:25:00.000Z	Pelo	argued	sorry wrote to the wrong guy again  karmic is running on the 2.6.31 branch,  atm,  you'll get updates of those but not for the 2.6.32 one
2010-01-13T04:26:00.000Z	Pelo	argued	that kind of recommendation is a bit over my head sorry
2010-01-13T04:27:00.000Z	Pelo	argued	what are you using to backup ? I just rsync over my network and it works fine
2010-01-13T04:27:00.000Z	argued	Pelo	np - tnx for the answers tho... I dont have my older versions in but that is easily aranged
2010-01-13T04:28:00.000Z	argued	Pelo	well the most correct answer is nautilus, I m taking backup on approx 7-8 Gb pictures since I am doing a lot of editing every day
2010-01-13T04:29:00.000Z	Pelo	argued	whre are you backing up to ?
2010-01-13T04:29:00.000Z	argued	Pelo	the problem is that my hd should be copying these files with 20-25 Mb/s , not 1-2 Mb/s
2010-01-13T04:29:00.000Z	argued	Pelo	another partition on same drive
2010-01-13T04:30:00.000Z	Pelo	argued	you're reading writing at the same time,  that ' s a lot of work for the reading head
2010-01-13T04:30:00.000Z	argued	Pelo	I get that, the physical aspect of the drive should be ok and there is very much free space left
2010-01-13T04:31:00.000Z	Pelo	argued	that's the best I can offer, sorry
2010-01-13T04:31:00.000Z	argued	Pelo	these problems started after an kernel update - thats why I came in with these questions
2010-01-13T04:32:00.000Z	argued	Pelo	tnx a lot anyway and have a good night
2010-01-13T04:33:00.000Z	Pelo	argued	well if you need to go back a version then that' s easy enought,   open synaptic  do a search for 2.6.31 , that should give you the kernel headers and images and such  , make sure you have those installed for previous versions ,curent one is 2.6.31-17 so look for -16
2010-01-13T04:33:00.000Z	argued	Pelo	I am looking for 13-14 . Think it would be best to take few steps back and start there.
2010-01-14T00:28:00.000Z	argued	Pelo	the downgrade solved my kernel issues last night - just wanted to thank you guys again
2010-01-14T00:28:00.000Z	Pelo	argued	no problem , we live for gratitude
2010-01-14T00:29:00.000Z	argued	Pelo	do you by any chance know how I set 2.6.31-14 as default on every restart.. I just noticed to be back on -17
2010-01-14T00:30:00.000Z	Pelo	argued	 you can remove the kernel's you donT' want from synaptic but you an also set the kernel you want to boot in the  /etc/default/grub file,  assuming you are using grub2 ,   in grub one you need to select it in  /boot/grub/menu.lst
2010-01-14T00:31:00.000Z	argued	Pelo	thank you again, have a good evening guys
