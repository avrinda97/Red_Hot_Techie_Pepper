2009-06-18T03:01:00.000Z	StephenZuc	ikonia	Whenever Xorg tries to run, my system freezes up and my screen is covered with graphical garbage.
2009-06-18T02:59:00.000Z	ikonia	StephenZuc	why do you want to do that ?
2009-06-18T02:59:00.000Z	StephenZuc	ikonia	Xorg is giving me problems.
2009-06-18T02:59:00.000Z	ikonia	StephenZuc	why re-install then unless you have deleted components
2009-06-18T03:00:00.000Z	StephenZuc	ikonia	Basically, whwnever it tries to run, my screen fills up with garbage and my inputs are nonresponsive.
2009-06-18T03:00:00.000Z	ikonia	StephenZuc	what video card do you have ?
2009-06-18T03:00:00.000Z	StephenZuc	ikonia	I may have corrupted components, is my thought. Uh, lemme think...
2009-06-18T03:00:00.000Z	StephenZuc	ikonia	Diamond Radeon 9550.
2009-06-18T03:00:00.000Z	ikonia	StephenZuc	why may you have corrupted components
2009-06-18T03:00:00.000Z	ikonia	StephenZuc	what makes you think that ?
2009-06-18T03:01:00.000Z	StephenZuc	ikonia	Well, I don't know what else to do.
2009-06-18T03:01:00.000Z	ikonia	StephenZuc	ok - so lets look at it logcically
2009-06-18T03:02:00.000Z	ikonia	StephenZuc	first thing to do is try the vesa xorg driver, have you done that yet ?
2009-06-18T03:02:00.000Z	StephenZuc	ikonia	I've never even  heard of that, nor am I entirely certain HOW to "try" the vesa xorg driver.
2009-06-18T03:02:00.000Z	ikonia	StephenZuc	that's fine - just checking I'm not wasting your time
2009-06-18T03:02:00.000Z	StephenZuc	ikonia	My expertise with unix extends to running the commands I read on man pages. :D
2009-06-18T03:02:00.000Z	ikonia	StephenZuc	in the file "/etc/X11/xorg.conf" you'll have a very limited set of information
2009-06-18T03:04:00.000Z	StephenZuc	ikonia	Alright, once I have that information, then what?
2009-06-18T03:05:00.000Z	ikonia	StephenZuc	look for a section "device" with an identifier that is your video card
2009-06-18T03:17:00.000Z	ikonia	StephenZuc	ok - in that section add the line Driver "vesa"
2009-06-18T03:18:00.000Z	StephenZuc	ikonia	Just add it? Alright, will do, and will report back.
2009-06-18T03:23:00.000Z	ikonia	StephenZuc	driver <space> "vesa"
