2008-05-29T06:40:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Steve-cal	I'm having the same issue as Catslacks
2008-05-29T06:43:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Steve-cal	iwconfig gives the standard info, but it's not associated with any access point (obviously).
2008-05-29T06:43:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Steve-cal	I'm using static IPs, but still it's not connecting.
2008-05-29T06:43:00.000Z	Steve-cal	The_PHP_Jedi	Exactly the same problem as Catslacks? Can't even connect to a non-encrypted AP? Just curious, might help us troubleshoot.
2008-05-29T06:44:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Steve-cal	yeah, exactly the same problem. Not sure on unsecure APs, as my modem doesn't allow you to set no encryption at all.
2008-05-29T06:44:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Steve-cal	I have tried both WEP open/shared, and WPA1. WPA used to work on my old install of Feisty and Debian Etch, but the same config doesn't work in Ubuntu Hardy.
2008-05-29T06:45:00.000Z	Steve-cal	The_PHP_Jedi	What chipset is yours?
2008-05-29T06:46:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Steve-cal	Marvell Tech Group Ltd. 99w8335 [Libertas] -- it's a netgear card.
2008-05-29T06:48:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Steve-cal	dmesg returns 'ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready' '....wlan0: link becomes ready' and then 'wlan0: no IPv6 routers present'
2008-05-29T06:48:00.000Z	Steve-cal	The_PHP_Jedi	I can't believe it--you are using almost the exact same chip I am--I've got a Libertas 88w8335. Mine works great with ndiswrapper.
2008-05-29T06:49:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Steve-cal	mine works great with ndiswrapper as well on other distros. I don't know why it isn't working on this fresh install of Hardy.
2008-05-29T06:56:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Steve-cal	dmesg returns 'ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready' '....wlan0: link becomes ready' and then 'wlan0: no IPv6 routers present'
2008-05-29T06:57:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Steve-cal	sure. Just highlight me. :)
2008-05-29T06:58:00.000Z	Steve-cal	The_PHP_Jedi	Catslacks: I probably should have asked this to begin with, but are you guys on 64 bit machines or 32 bit?
2008-05-29T06:59:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Steve-cal	32 bit.
2008-05-29T07:19:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Steve-cal	I'm browsing through the forums. Nothing yet. Thanks for all the help. :)
2008-05-29T07:20:00.000Z	Steve-cal	The_PHP_Jedi	Your welcome. I know how aggravating it can be to have everything working, upgrade, and then have things break.
2008-05-29T07:21:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Steve-cal	actually, it's a fresh install. It works fine on my old Feisty install and Debian.
2008-05-29T07:30:00.000Z	Steve-cal	The_PHP_Jedi	So you're connected with WEP now? Or with no encryption?
2008-05-29T07:31:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Steve-cal	with WEP. I removed wpa_supplicant, since I noticed it was running, even though I wasn't trying to connect to the AP using WPA.
2008-05-29T07:32:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Steve-cal	thanks for the help, seriously man. :D
2008-05-29T07:32:00.000Z	Steve-cal	The_PHP_Jedi	No problem--hopefully you can get WPA working too soon. Take care. :)
