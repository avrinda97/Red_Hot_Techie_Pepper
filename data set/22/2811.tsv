2010-04-19T12:54:00.000Z	perhamlinux	manohar	what do you mean exactly? your bandwidth is shared by default to all running processes
2010-04-19T12:55:00.000Z	manohar	perhamlinux	when i download anything other sites dont open
2010-04-19T12:55:00.000Z	manohar	perhamlinux	when i download anything other sites dont open
2010-04-19T12:56:00.000Z	perhamlinux	manohar	how about caping your download speed? are you using a download manager or firefox's default?
2010-04-19T12:57:00.000Z	manohar	perhamlinux	firefox default
2010-04-19T12:58:00.000Z	perhamlinux	manohar	sudo apt-get install d4x , and then install flashgot addon for firefox
2010-04-19T12:58:00.000Z	manohar	perhamlinux	i have d4x already installed
2010-04-19T12:58:00.000Z	perhamlinux	manohar	then you can download with D4x and use different speed schemes
2010-04-19T13:00:00.000Z	manohar	perhamlinux	i use the same method for most downloads but when i update my system with update manager then too it takes all bandwidth
2010-04-19T13:02:00.000Z	manohar	perhamlinux	it is not that downloads from firefox is causing problem. it is happening when i install through apt-get install. this also takes all bandwidth
2010-04-19T13:13:00.000Z	perhamlinux	manohar	are you downloading using d4x?
2010-04-19T13:14:00.000Z	manohar	perhamlinux	i download most of the stuff using D$x
2010-04-19T13:15:00.000Z	perhamlinux	manohar	then you can use Options -> Speed to set speed limit on your downloads
2010-04-19T13:16:00.000Z	manohar	perhamlinux	but i have problem when i update packages using update manager or i also hav problem when installing softwares using apt-get install command
