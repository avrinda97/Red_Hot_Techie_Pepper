2008-07-17T16:22:00.000Z	glitsj16	EminX	for a general install overview in ubuntu, check http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/ .. java is in the repo's, do you have any special needs that make you compile it yourself ?
2008-07-17T16:24:00.000Z	EminX	glitsj16	I read it there weren't enough info for this kind o files
2008-07-17T16:25:00.000Z	glitsj16	EminX	for whick kind of files ?
2008-07-17T16:26:00.000Z	EminX	glitsj16	ï»¿I've tried to install java jre-6u7...
2008-07-17T16:27:00.000Z	glitsj16	EminX	try "sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre" .. that's via the ubuntu package manager, no need to compile that
2008-07-17T16:28:00.000Z	EminX	glitsj16	thanx a lot, and is it possible to get a setup of java that i can install on pc without internet
2008-07-17T16:31:00.000Z	glitsj16	EminX	the package you just downloaded and installed still resides on your system at /var/cache/apt/archives .. if you want to install it on another ubuntu machine, backup that entire dir (for possible dependencies) and copy it to the other pc .. there's also a package called aptoncd that might be worth a look for those kind of operations
2008-07-17T16:31:00.000Z	EminX	glitsj16	thanx a lot
2008-07-17T16:32:00.000Z	glitsj16	EminX	you're welcome, np
2008-07-17T16:34:00.000Z	EminX	glitsj16	if I install something from synaptic pm, does it save also the files on that cashe folder
2008-07-17T16:35:00.000Z	glitsj16	EminX	yes that's the default setting, if you haven't changed that in synaptic they should all be there
2008-07-17T16:36:00.000Z	EminX	glitsj16	ok i would ask you and some more questions about the way to install in other computers, if you have time
2008-07-17T16:37:00.000Z	glitsj16	EminX	no problem, feel free to pm me
2008-07-17T16:37:00.000Z	EminX	glitsj16	so if I copy all the files on that folder, should I copy them in the same directory in other computers
2008-07-17T16:39:00.000Z	EminX	glitsj16	and which is the best way to install those software, through synaptic or how?
2008-07-17T16:39:00.000Z	glitsj16	EminX	correct, apt (the package manager) will find them there and not go out to the internet, on ubuntu machines this is, other linux distro's have similar but different package managers, just don't mix 'em and you'll be fine
2008-07-17T16:41:00.000Z	EminX	glitsj16	thanx again (Y)
2008-07-17T16:43:00.000Z	glitsj16	EminX	if you're going to copy to a lot of machines that aptoncd package would even work smoother, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/APTonCD
2008-07-17T16:44:00.000Z	EminX	glitsj16	ok i will read about it, I don't know how it works or what is it exactly
2008-07-17T16:46:00.000Z	glitsj16	EminX	basically it creates a movable repository, very handy for installing things on pc's without internet connection
2008-07-17T16:48:00.000Z	EminX	glitsj16	yep, exactly what I need, couse I will install Ubuntu in a lot of Schools here in Kosova (if you know where is it), and I want to make a good ubuntu without missing updates, software or plug-ins etc, thank you man
2008-07-17T16:50:00.000Z	glitsj16	EminX	i'm in Europe myself, so yes, i know where it is ;) .. UCK (Ubuntu Customazation Kit) could also be of use to you in that context --> http://uck.sourceforge.net/
