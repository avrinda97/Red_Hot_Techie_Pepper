2012-06-23T18:47:00.000Z	L3top	bjrohan	you will want to purge fglrx if you intend not to use it. It causes multiple conflicts
2012-06-23T18:50:00.000Z	bjrohan	L3top	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Radeon Mobility X1400 [1002:7145]
2012-06-23T18:51:00.000Z	L3top	bjrohan	I do not believe you will be able to use the fglrx driver
2012-06-23T18:52:00.000Z	bjrohan	L3top	Any suggestions? Unity 3D was woking fine when I had 11.10 installed, upgraded to 12.04 and then no systray, no 3D rendering :-(
2012-06-23T18:54:00.000Z	bjrohan	L3top	when I ask for packages I do get:
2012-06-23T18:55:00.000Z	L3top	bjrohan	yes... that is no longer supported. That looks like you have a PPA you are trying to get it from. Newer drivers will not work.
2012-06-23T18:57:00.000Z	bjrohan	L3top	what do you mean a ppa trying to get it from? the drivers? I downloaded the file from the ATI/AMD site
2012-06-23T18:57:00.000Z	bjrohan	L3top	What do you recommend I try to do?
2012-06-23T18:58:00.000Z	bjrohan	L3top	thank you for helping me, this has been plaquing me for months
2012-06-23T19:02:00.000Z	L3top	bjrohan	http://pastebin.com/aC95khK6          you can just dump all that into a terminal and it will do everything you need. Then reboot
2012-06-23T19:03:00.000Z	bjrohan	L3top	Line by line correct, not all at once
2012-06-23T19:04:00.000Z	L3top	bjrohan	if you sudo something and enter your password, you can just drop the whole thing in at once. Otherwise go line by line. Taking weird commands from a stranger in IRC would make me want to do it line by line... but it is all good.
2012-06-23T19:12:00.000Z	bjrohan	L3top	 I ran every line in the pastebin, restart now?
2012-06-23T19:19:00.000Z	bjrohan	L3top	I am back after completing your pastebin lines and rebooting. Now what
2012-06-23T19:20:00.000Z	L3top	bjrohan	Nothing. Everything should be working as well as it can :)
2012-06-23T19:26:00.000Z	bjrohan	L3top	How can I tell if 3D on my card is working properly?
2012-06-23T19:29:00.000Z	L3top	bjrohan	^
2012-06-23T19:32:00.000Z	bjrohan	L3top	How do I use the mesa-utils (they are already installed) and run glxgears?
2012-06-23T19:33:00.000Z	L3top	bjrohan	type glxgears
2012-06-23T19:34:00.000Z	bjrohan	L3top	It showed me gears working, yippee
2012-06-23T19:34:00.000Z	bjrohan	L3top	So it is working as best it could then?
2012-06-23T19:48:00.000Z	bjrohan	L3top	and reisio THANK YOU THANK YOU, I can log into Unity 3D and it worked, my Cairo dock also works.!
