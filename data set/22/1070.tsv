2010-10-26T22:25:00.000Z	etheretic1		Are there any benefits to format an external usb drive to ext4 instead of ext3?
2010-10-26T22:26:00.000Z	utilitytrack	etheretic1	external HDD? SDD?
2010-10-26T22:27:00.000Z	etheretic1	utilitytrack	hdd.
2010-10-26T22:27:00.000Z	utilitytrack	etheretic1	SSD, sorry.
2010-10-26T22:27:00.000Z	etheretic1	utilitytrack	1.5tb wd elements.
2010-10-26T22:28:00.000Z	etheretic1	utilitytrack	seems a few tools won't work with ext3 - using synaptic, most seem to be ext only.
2010-10-26T22:29:00.000Z	utilitytrack	etheretic1	No difference, if you do not take into account that ext3 used much more long time
2010-10-26T22:30:00.000Z	etheretic1	utilitytrack	are you saying that ext4 is too new/untested?

2010-10-26T22:31:00.000Z	utilitytrack	etheretic1	No, I didn't say that ext4 are untested.
2010-10-26T22:32:00.000Z	etheretic1	utilitytrack	so ext4 is fine for external hdd, then.
2010-10-26T22:35:00.000Z	utilitytrack	etheretic1	In general it's best choise, but you can be interested ReiserFS and XFS also
2010-10-26T22:36:00.000Z	etheretic1	utilitytrack	it is important that it is well supported by programs to recover data, etc.
2010-10-26T22:45:00.000Z	utilitytrack	etheretic1	There is journals. Why do you worry about data recovering? If your HDD will not contain physical bad blocks only, you not needed to worry about data loss with journalling file systems.
2010-10-26T22:46:00.000Z	etheretic1	utilitytrack	it started with bad blocks on an ext3-formatted hdd (another 1.5tb wd elements)
2010-10-26T22:47:00.000Z	utilitytrack	etheretic1	How many it?
2010-10-26T22:47:00.000Z	etheretic1	utilitytrack	it what?
2010-10-26T22:49:00.000Z	utilitytrack	etheretic1	How many bad blocks on your external HDD
2010-10-26T22:51:00.000Z	etheretic1	utilitytrack	can't investigate that now - busy analyzing another hdd w. testdisk.
2010-10-26T22:51:00.000Z	utilitytrack	etheretic1	Ok, good luck you.
2010-10-26T22:52:00.000Z	etheretic1	utilitytrack	thanks - 1.5tb+ data to recover - sleepless night.
2010-10-26T22:54:00.000Z	utilitytrack	etheretic1	What happened with this 1.5TB drive?
