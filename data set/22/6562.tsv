2006-09-23T11:53:00.000Z	lehel		hello
2006-09-23T11:55:00.000Z	lehel		Administrative Applecation wont start?, i see the opening window: "Starting Administrative Application", but then just closes
2006-09-23T11:56:00.000Z	lehel		what about my "Administrative Application" ? i can't "go" Advanced on "Install/Remove Packages",
2006-09-23T11:57:00.000Z	lehel		i should log in as root to X? to start the "Administrative Application"?
2006-09-23T11:57:00.000Z	ladydoor	lehel	no! use gksudo
2006-09-23T11:57:00.000Z	ladydoor	lehel	<alt>F2, gksudo commandname <enter>
2006-09-23T11:59:00.000Z	lehel	ladydoor	and what would be the executable of the "Administrative Application" ? other words i'm trying to install konsole from Install/Remove Packages, and i need to go Advanced, can't
2006-09-23T11:59:00.000Z	ladydoor	lehel	i don't know what any of that is except for konsole. why not do sudo aptitude install console in a terminal instead?
2006-09-23T11:59:00.000Z	ladydoor	lehel	much simpler
2006-09-23T12:00:00.000Z	ladydoor	lehel	*and replace "console" in what i said with "konsole," of course
2006-09-23T12:01:00.000Z	lehel	ladydoor	good point, but why do you use allways use the "sudo" before a command? [i assume default is not being root, that's why] 
2006-09-23T12:01:00.000Z	ladydoor	lehel	it's because to install a program you need to be or "be" root. sudo gives you temporary superuser powers
2006-09-23T12:02:00.000Z	lehel	ladydoor	i activated the root user, i'm allways root with just a "su" command,
2006-09-23T12:02:00.000Z	ladydoor	lehel	ok, if you prefer to su, do that and do aptitude install konsole.
2006-09-23T12:02:00.000Z	lehel	ladydoor	right, done!
2006-09-23T12:02:00.000Z	ladydoor	lehel	sweet!
2006-09-23T12:03:00.000Z	ladydoor	lehel	in general it's easier, esp. if you know the packagename, to just type it in :-)
2006-09-23T12:07:00.000Z	lehel	ladydoor	i did know that it's easier, but i was curious why the Administrative Application wont start in X,
2006-09-23T12:07:00.000Z	ladydoor	lehel	i don't know--i avoid graphikal applications altogether if i can avoid it.
2006-09-23T12:07:00.000Z	ladydoor	lehel	sorry
2006-09-23T12:09:00.000Z	lehel	ladydoor	right, me to; but i installed this distro to a friend of my, who doesn't really has clue about linux, and i thought everything can be done in the graphical environment
2006-09-23T12:09:00.000Z	ladydoor	lehel	yeah, i don't know. i'd suggest sticking with synaptic/adapt in that case
