2007-03-18T16:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	quaal	i've downloaded videos to my desktop, started watching them(mostly tv shows), realized i wanted to keep it, then moved it to a folder in my home folder that i back up once a week, never a problem... keeps playing.
2007-03-18T16:25:00.000Z	quaal	IndyGunFreak	amazing.
2007-03-18T16:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	quaal	not sure how it does it, but ive done it several times w/o a problem
2007-03-18T16:26:00.000Z	quaal	IndyGunFreak	im backing up my entire music drive right now
2007-07-13T11:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	quaal	i see..,
2007-07-13T11:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	quaal	what version of quickbooks do you use?
2007-07-13T11:55:00.000Z	quaal	IndyGunFreak	not sure
2007-07-13T11:56:00.000Z	quaal	IndyGunFreak	i just gave this guy an ubuntu7.04 cd because his windows is giving him shit freezing all the time
2007-07-13T11:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	quaal	doesn't look like it works w/ wine
2007-07-13T11:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	quaal	just doing some light googling, his best option might be to run WinXP in VMWare, and then install Quickboks there, and fire up Vmware when he needs to run Quickbook
2007-07-13T11:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	quaal	doesn't look like it works under linux, and i can't find any real alternatives
2007-07-13T12:00:00.000Z	quaal	IndyGunFreak	yea i was thinking the same.
2007-07-13T12:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	quaal	or, leave Windows about 10-20gig partition, which is plenty for Quickbooks, IE, and Office(which quickbooks really needs), and then assign the rest of the hard drive to Ubuntu.., and dual boot xp and ubuntu.., and just boot XP when quickbooks is needed, but vmware is probably more practical.
2007-07-13T12:02:00.000Z	quaal	IndyGunFreak	thanks
