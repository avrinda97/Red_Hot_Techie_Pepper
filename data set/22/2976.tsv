2009-03-28T23:47:00.000Z	Frijolie		oCean, hard = hard to configure...both ends are server and client
2009-03-28T23:48:00.000Z	oCean_	Frijolie	it should not - but sometimes... (sorry for the obvious answer) For ftp port 21 should be open and NAT'ed
2009-03-28T23:40:00.000Z	oCean_	Frijolie	please be serious. This is not social channel nor chat
2009-03-28T23:41:00.000Z	Frijolie	oCean_	I'm not here to be social, i'm here to get help...but if nobody's here to help you've got to do something to "be patient"
2009-03-28T23:42:00.000Z	oCean_	Frijolie	I understand, and your help is appreciated. It's just that not every user coming here would know that you are joking.
2009-03-28T23:42:00.000Z	oCean_	Frijolie	what was your question?
2009-03-28T23:42:00.000Z	Frijolie	oCean_	I'm trying to set up FTP file shares between myself and a buddy
2009-03-28T23:43:00.000Z	Frijolie	oCean_	via Filezilla and it's not working. it's complaining about "mismatched ports" although all ports are open and forwarded to my internal IP
2009-03-28T23:43:00.000Z	oCean_	Frijolie	ok. FTP server is setup?
2009-03-28T23:44:00.000Z	Frijolie	oCean_	do you have to run a server as a service? or does that come with Filezilla
2009-03-28T23:44:00.000Z	Frijolie	oCean_	that was my first question
2009-03-28T23:44:00.000Z	oCean_	Frijolie	You have to setup a seperate FTP service / daemon
2009-03-28T23:45:00.000Z	Frijolie	oCean_	ok, so you have to have it running. That's what I was thinking. What's the package you have to download?
2009-03-28T23:45:00.000Z	oCean_	Frijolie	filezilla is only the client.
2009-03-28T23:46:00.000Z	oCean_	Frijolie	I like the proftpd, but they all have their own tweaks
2009-03-28T23:46:00.000Z	Frijolie	oCean_	why did I not come across those with Google? I did see something about vsftpd but it was in Ubuntu docs but for 6.06
2009-03-28T23:47:00.000Z	Frijolie	oCean_	is it hard if you're behind NAT?
2009-03-28T23:49:00.000Z	Frijolie	oCean_	yeah, I've already got port 21 forwarded to my internal IP
2009-03-28T23:49:00.000Z	Frijolie	oCean_	installing proftpd now
2009-03-28T23:50:00.000Z	oCean_	Frijolie	let me find a link for setup
2009-03-28T23:51:00.000Z	oCean_	Frijolie	ubuntugeek tutorials are nice: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/settingup-an-ftp-server-on-ubuntu-with-proftpd.html
2009-03-29T00:09:00.000Z	oCean_	Frijolie	run "sudo netstat -anp | grep 21" and look in the upper few lines or do "sudo netstat -anp |grep ftp" Also, you could try to "ftp localhost"
