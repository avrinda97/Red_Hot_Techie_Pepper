2006-08-19T14:41:00.000Z	zsh		hi! i just upgraded to dapper from breezy but i'm still running on the 2.6.12 linux kernel instead of 2.6.15. anyone know how i can sort this out??
2006-08-19T14:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zsh	have you rebooted since?
2006-08-19T14:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zsh	hmm - odd then
2006-08-19T14:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zsh	is 2.6.15 in your /boot directory ?
2006-08-19T14:44:00.000Z	zsh	thoreauputic	there are some files that have 2.6.15 in them
2006-08-19T14:45:00.000Z	zsh	thoreauputic	like system.map-2.6.15
2006-08-19T14:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zsh	you are looking for something like vmlinuz-2.6.15-26-686
2006-08-19T14:45:00.000Z	zsh	thoreauputic	yes its there
2006-08-19T14:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zsh	OK grub needs a reminder I guess - try running sudo update-grub
2006-08-19T14:47:00.000Z	zsh	thoreauputic	it says no grub directory found.
2006-08-19T14:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zsh	hmmm
2006-08-19T14:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zsh	do you have a /boot/grub directory?
2006-08-19T14:49:00.000Z	zsh	thoreauputic	nope!
2006-08-19T14:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zsh	well, that seems to be the problem then
2006-08-19T14:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zsh	somehow you lost your grub dir
2006-08-19T14:50:00.000Z	zsh	thoreauputic	i dont get it. last time i upgraded the kernel i didnt have this problem
2006-08-19T14:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zsh	yes, it seems very odd
2006-08-19T14:50:00.000Z	zsh	thoreauputic	does it matter that my box is dual boot
2006-08-19T14:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zsh	you might have to reinstall grub
2006-08-19T14:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zsh	it might matter - do you have another linux, or windows?
2006-08-19T14:51:00.000Z	zsh	thoreauputic	i had windows initially, then i after i found out the joys of ubuntu i formatted that partition
2006-08-19T14:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zsh	for instance do youhave a separate /boot partition?
