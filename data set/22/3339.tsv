2008-10-23T01:27:00.000Z	Skky		Do I have to do anything special with Ubuntu to use CIFS?  Or should it work out of the box?
2008-10-23T01:29:00.000Z	Skky		Ok, I am having trouble.  I am trying to mount a shared drive I have on Windows.  I created it on C:\Photos and shared it, giving read/write permissions

2008-10-23T01:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Skky	if its not linux to linux its samba

2008-10-23T01:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Skky	id use that, its all on the post i gave you
2008-10-23T01:49:00.000Z	Skky	ActionParsnip	in the link you gave me they have you editing your fstab file but the type of mount in it is "cifs" - I thought cifs couldn't access windows?
2008-10-23T01:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Skky	thats my understanding, mind you that link is the official documentation. id stick with that

2008-10-23T01:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Skky	ps -ef | grep -i samba

2008-10-23T01:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Skky	thats the pid of the command you just ran
2008-10-23T01:58:00.000Z	Skky	ActionParsnip	nothing else showed up
2008-10-23T01:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Skky	yu only need to run samba on the system to share files from yuor linux system if memory serves
2008-10-23T01:59:00.000Z	Skky	ActionParsnip	yes, I am also trying to do that
2008-10-23T01:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Skky	i thought you were mounting the windows partition?
2008-10-23T02:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Skky	oic, then you need sudo apt-get install samba
2008-10-23T02:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Skky	sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install samba
