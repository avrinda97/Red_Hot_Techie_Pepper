2005-10-22T13:09:00.000Z	ptlo	mamoru	redeeman: conio is borland's text-mode "interface" library similar to unix 'ncurses' (similar in goal, not in api)
2005-10-22T13:10:00.000Z	ptlo	mamoru	redeeman: afaik, it's dos-only
2005-10-22T13:10:00.000Z	mamoru	ptlo	thank you, I didn't know it
2005-10-22T13:11:00.000Z	ptlo	mamoru	if you need similar functionality, i suggest you read up on ncurses and/or slang libraries. on the other hand, if you just need clrscr() or waiting for a key, that can be easily done with standard c stuff :)
2005-10-22T13:12:00.000Z	mamoru	ptlo	it is the getch() in the code, i'll change it to smth
2005-10-22T13:12:00.000Z	mamoru	ptlo	btw, do you have any advice?
2005-10-22T13:12:00.000Z	ptlo	mamoru	try getchar()
2005-10-22T13:12:00.000Z	mamoru	ptlo	thx
2005-10-22T13:15:00.000Z	mamoru	ptlo	omg it now says "undefined reference to 'tan'"
2005-10-22T13:15:00.000Z	ptlo	mamoru	you need to link it with math library
2005-10-22T13:15:00.000Z	mamoru	ptlo	isn't the math.h the standard header file?
2005-10-22T13:15:00.000Z	mamoru	ptlo	how?
2005-10-22T13:16:00.000Z	ptlo	mamoru	#include just includes the header file which tells compiler that there is a function somewhere...you also need to link with it in order to produce working code. with gcc, you do that with '-l' option: gcc -o foo foo.c -lm (-lm will link with libm.so, which is standard math library)
2005-10-22T13:17:00.000Z	mamoru	ptlo	thx a lot
2005-10-22T13:19:00.000Z	mamoru	ptlo	omg it still cannot run :'(    now it says /tmp/ccYwE9ma.o:(.eh_frame+0x11): undefined reference to '__gxx_personality_v0'
2005-10-22T13:19:00.000Z	mamoru	ptlo	collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
2005-10-22T13:19:00.000Z	ptlo	mamoru	ah, you need to compile it with 'g++', not 'gcc', sorry :)
2005-10-22T13:20:00.000Z	mamoru	ptlo	thanks!
2005-10-22T13:20:00.000Z	ptlo	mamoru	no problem, i'm glad it worked :)
2005-10-22T13:21:00.000Z	mamoru	ptlo	i was already going to give up
2005-10-22T14:19:00.000Z	ptlo	mamoru	if you want something like visual studio ide, look at anjuta (or eclipse, which is java-based, but afaik can be used with c/c++ also)
2005-10-22T14:19:00.000Z	mamoru	ptlo	anjuta? gonna try, thx!
