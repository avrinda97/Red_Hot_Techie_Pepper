2005-10-22T15:16:00.000Z	aftertaf	tuxedo_kamen	 why not use the official repositories?
2005-10-22T15:16:00.000Z	tuxedo_kamen	aftertaf	in Portugal we have international download limits, and it would be very costy to donwload it from a non-portuguese website!
2005-10-22T15:17:00.000Z	aftertaf	tuxedo_kamen	 ok. isnt there an official pt.archive.ubuntu.com avaitable?
2005-10-22T15:18:00.000Z	tuxedo_kamen	aftertaf	I don't think so
2005-10-22T15:19:00.000Z	aftertaf	tuxedo_kamen	 can you paste your surces.list to pastebin?
2005-10-22T15:21:00.000Z	aftertaf	tuxedo_kamen	 there arent any packages in http://darkstar.ist.utl.pt/ubuntu/5.10, only ISOs
2005-10-22T15:22:00.000Z	aftertaf	tuxedo_kamen	 all the lines like deb ftp://ftp.rnl.ist.utl.pt/ubuntu/ hoary universe........
2005-10-22T15:22:00.000Z	aftertaf	tuxedo_kamen	 have you tried changing each from hoary to breezy?
2005-10-22T15:23:00.000Z	aftertaf	tuxedo_kamen	 try it, either its safe, or breezy aint on there.
2005-10-22T15:24:00.000Z	tuxedo_kamen	aftertaf	perhaps you didn't understand my question... is it safe to use the new version? Will it keep my ssh open, as it is now?
2005-10-22T15:24:00.000Z	aftertaf	tuxedo_kamen	 should do no problem yeah, you connecting to it now via ssh?
2005-10-22T15:25:00.000Z	aftertaf	tuxedo_kamen	 ^^which means it only breaks things we know about ;)
2005-10-22T15:25:00.000Z	tuxedo_kamen	aftertaf	I connect from university to my house by ssh, so that I don't spend much of my internet limit! :D
2005-10-22T15:26:00.000Z	aftertaf	tuxedo_kamen	 hehe. down wth restrictions and facsism in general !!!
2005-10-22T15:26:00.000Z	aftertaf	tuxedo_kamen	 it should be ok...... though it will restart the ssh server at some point during upgrade.
2005-10-22T15:26:00.000Z	tuxedo_kamen	aftertaf	it's really dumb... in portugal, we can only download 1~2 international GB per month, depending on the connection
2005-10-22T15:28:00.000Z	aftertaf	tuxedo_kamen	 http://pt.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ does exist....
2005-10-22T15:29:00.000Z	aftertaf	tuxedo_kamen	 but it doesnt have a .pt dns ending. so might not be considered noninternational
2005-10-22T15:31:00.000Z	aftertaf	tuxedo_kamen	 keep yourmirrors, change all instances of hoary to breezy in your sources.list and apt-get update like a linux addict :)
2005-10-22T15:32:00.000Z	aftertaf	tuxedo_kamen	 good.   update then upgrade, and do it from within screen, that way tou can disconnect ssh and reconnect :)
