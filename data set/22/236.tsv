2012-03-20T01:35:00.000Z	Zaitzev		evening folks
2012-03-20T01:37:00.000Z	Zaitzev		all of a sudden i've started getting these purple pixels all over the place, randomly
2012-03-20T01:37:00.000Z	Zaitzev		playing videos, on certain parts of the desktop..
2012-03-20T01:38:00.000Z	Zaitzev		?
2012-03-20T01:38:00.000Z	Zaitzev		it wasn't like this last night
2012-03-20T01:38:00.000Z	dlentz	Zaitzev	so what changed, any system updates, etc?
2012-03-20T01:39:00.000Z	dlentz	Zaitzev	have you tried a livecd or other OS?
2012-03-20T01:40:00.000Z	Zaitzev	dlentz	not yet no, was hoping it could be resolved before doing anything "drastic"
2012-03-20T01:40:00.000Z	Zaitzev	dlentz	here's a short videoclip of how it looks like: http://speedy.sh/fvUtP/IMG-0133.MOV
2012-03-20T01:42:00.000Z	dlentz	Zaitzev	I'd also double-check the cable and make sure it's toght
2012-03-20T01:42:00.000Z	Zaitzev	dlentz	it is, that's the first thing I checked hehe
2012-03-20T01:45:00.000Z	Zaitzev	dlentz	The "Additional Drivers" dialog, which of the two choices should I use? There's "Recommended" and "version current-updates" to choose from. The "Recommended" is active and has been since day 1
2012-03-20T01:50:00.000Z	dlentz	Zaitzev	if the recommended driver worked, then try reinstalling it
2012-03-20T02:32:00.000Z	Zaitzev	dlentz	Hey again. I'm on Windows now. The problem doesn't occur here at all, so it is definitely an Ubuntu issue.
2012-03-20T02:33:00.000Z	dlentz	Zaitzev	that's good news
2012-03-20T02:36:00.000Z	Zaitzev	dlentz	I suspect Unity being the perp, but I can't say for sure.
2012-03-20T02:37:00.000Z	dlentz	Zaitzev	then you hsould try some lightweight environment like lxde just to see
2012-03-20T02:37:00.000Z	Zaitzev	dlentz	Uh, what?
2012-03-20T02:40:00.000Z	dlentz	Zaitzev	yes, but you need to install lxde first (sudo apt-get install  --no-install-recommends lxde)
2012-03-20T02:40:00.000Z	Zaitzev	dlentz	I'm gonna boot into Ubuntu again soon, I'll try and remember it.
2012-03-20T02:41:00.000Z	dlentz	Zaitzev	then just remember to install lxde package
2012-03-20T02:42:00.000Z	Zaitzev	dlentz	yeah, but that whole no-recommend thing.. guess I should write it down. :p
