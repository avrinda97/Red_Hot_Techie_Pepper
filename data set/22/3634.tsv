2008-10-13T10:24:00.000Z	WIGGMPk		Is there a way to adjust the SWAP partition size after the install?
2008-10-13T10:25:00.000Z	Flannel	WIGGMPk	Yep, that page explains it all.
2008-10-13T10:26:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Flannel	thanks

2008-10-27T10:36:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Flannel	LMFAO should of guessed.. thanks Flannel
2008-11-03T13:31:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Flannel	the first was accidently messaged to a specific user and not genearlly but I get your poing
2008-11-03T13:33:00.000Z	Flannel	WIGGMPk	its not bleeding edge though.
2008-11-03T13:34:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Flannel	I know its not, but you could look at it like that when making a decision on which to instal
2008-11-03T13:35:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Flannel	maybe I used to the wrong combination of words there
2008-11-08T13:05:00.000Z	Flannel	WIGGMPk	transcoding lossy to lossy is a bad idea.
2008-11-08T13:05:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Flannel	lossy? I dont follow
2008-11-08T13:07:00.000Z	Flannel	WIGGMPk	mp3 and ogg are both lossy audio compression schemes (which means they throw data out to accomplish the compression).  Converting from one lossy format to another means you get information thrown out from encoding 1, and more information thrown out from encoding 2.  So your sound quality is much worse than if you ripped directly to encoding 2 (or went from a lossless codec, like FLAC, straight to encoding 2)
2008-11-08T13:09:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Flannel	wow, I had no idea about that Flannel, thanks.. what if you only have an audio file that is already in a lossy form? what is the best way to proceed (if you need it to be in another format, say one that is more universally accepted?)
2008-11-08T13:10:00.000Z	Flannel	WIGGMPk	Unfortunately theres no alternative if you need it in format B and only have it in format A.  In the future, if you're "archiving", rip to FLAC, which is lossless, and will allow you to encode in the format-of-the-month without any quality loss.
2008-11-08T13:11:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Flannel	sound has never been my strong point, and I really appreciate the education. Is there anything extra required for ubuntu to process FLAC or is this supported by default?
2008-12-07T13:19:00.000Z	Flannel	WIGGMPk	gerhard: easier to `sudo touch /forcefsck` and then reboot
2008-12-07T13:19:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Flannel	thanks for that.. I didnt know about that
2008-12-07T13:22:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Flannel	how do you turn off gnome-panel in 8.10?
2009-01-30T10:50:00.000Z	Flannel	WIGGMPk	What are you trying to accomplish?
2009-01-30T10:51:00.000Z	Flannel	WIGGMPk	If its long, you can pastebin and then post the question here.  That will save you from having to repeat it over and over again.
2009-01-30T10:51:00.000Z	Flannel	WIGGMPk	Alright
2009-08-29T23:30:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Flannel	dont you sleep
