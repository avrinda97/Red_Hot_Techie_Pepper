2012-06-21T16:58:00.000Z	Nytelife		I have followed every instruction.. every tip
2012-06-21T16:58:00.000Z	Nytelife		and all I want to do is kick puppies ;)
2012-06-21T16:59:00.000Z	Nytelife		well, I can get them to work
2012-06-21T16:59:00.000Z	Nytelife		problem is with things like xbmc
2012-06-21T16:59:00.000Z	Nytelife		and the unity bar keeps jumping to the hdtv on the wall where I dont want it
2012-06-21T17:00:00.000Z	Nytelife		xbmc wants to strech across all if I use multi deskop. If I use the other, it appears on both screens
2012-06-21T17:01:00.000Z	Nytelife		yeah I am trying to do the wubi install
2012-06-21T17:01:00.000Z	Nytelife		so that may be a factor
2012-06-21T17:01:00.000Z	Nytelife		want to make sure I can do everything I do in Windows (To a degree) before I completely cut over
2012-06-21T17:02:00.000Z	Nytelife		with nvidia you can have each display as a seperate x screen right?
2012-06-21T17:03:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Nytelife	Actually doing it thru Wubi might be your issue
2012-06-21T17:04:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Nytelife	Have you considered loading the Ubuntu ISO onto a flashdrive and Live-booting it and tweaking from there.
2012-06-21T17:04:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Nytelife	You can preview Ubuntu and make changes to the flashdrive ISO without having to install it on your computer
2012-06-21T17:08:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Nytelife	This might sound a little complicated... but there is a specific process you can follow to make sure that the flashdrive operates correctly when Live-Previewing
2012-06-21T17:09:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Nytelife	If you're moving from *anything else* to Ubuntu, the process is a little complicated.
2012-06-21T17:09:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Nytelife	You need to burn the ISO to a disk, and then Live-boot the disk. While in Live Mode, mount your hard drive, and find the ISO image...
2012-06-21T17:10:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Nytelife	Then use usb-creator-gtk to create the flashdrive.
2012-06-21T17:11:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Nytelife	The Ubuntu USB Creator has more options that you would get by just decompressing the ISO to a flashdrive.
2012-06-21T17:11:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Nytelife	Specifically, you can set up the flashdrive allow package installation and to store packages and system info on the remaining space on the flashdrive.
2012-06-21T17:12:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Nytelife	And that's what you need to get a true Live-Preview.
2012-06-21T17:12:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Nytelife	Set it up so it uses the whole flashdrive and stores and SAVES all the extra data on the flashdrive.
2012-06-21T17:13:00.000Z	cypher-neo	Nytelife	Make sense?
