2008-05-16T23:40:00.000Z	el1te		when apt-get tries to install java...it wants me to agree to it in the "SHOW DETAILS" window
2008-05-16T23:40:00.000Z	el1te		how do i enter that window to agree to it
2008-05-16T23:40:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	Open it up by clicking the little arrow next to it
2008-05-16T23:41:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	In the little window that comes up and shows you the installation progress
2008-05-16T23:42:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	How are you installing this?
2008-05-16T23:42:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	Adept may be a little different in the layout.  #kubuntu could tell you more concretely.  Or you can just do this via the command line,
2008-05-16T23:44:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	You should ask in #kubuntu, I don't know.
2008-06-25T04:08:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	you mean bluez-audio?
2008-06-25T04:11:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	You were asked a question, you haven't answered.  Also, people in here are volunteers.
2008-06-25T04:15:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	I did
2008-06-25T04:16:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	Are you sure there was one?
2008-06-25T04:18:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	Ah, well, you're asking in a rather horrible fashion.  Its a card?  Whats the card model?
2008-06-25T04:19:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	Thats what you *should* be asking about.  Support for ATI tv wonder aydda yadda
2008-06-25T04:20:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	Again, it doesn't quite work that way.
2008-06-25T04:21:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	Stop being annoying and rude.  You're being helped. Stop being stupid
2008-06-25T04:22:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	Like I said, it *doesn't* work like that.  You don't necessarily have a driver for that particular chip on the board.  Calm the hell down, and be patient.
2008-06-25T04:23:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	fine.  Find it yourself.
2008-06-25T04:32:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	It didn't stop being used.  Its not in the stable kernel yet.
2008-06-25T04:33:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	Not according to the internets.  Again, I was trying to explain this to you, but you kept spamming about being ignored.
2008-06-25T04:34:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	Try debian.  See : http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Btaudio
2008-06-25T04:36:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	4.10 was the earliest.  Please, go to #ubuntu-offtopic to continue this discussion, as its getting further offtopic as we speak.
2008-06-25T04:40:00.000Z	Flannel	el1te	Again, google would've found it for you: http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/4.10/
