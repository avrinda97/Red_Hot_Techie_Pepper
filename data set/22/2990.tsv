2009-10-27T23:11:00.000Z	jhb1608		used my RAM to 100%
2009-10-27T23:12:00.000Z	jhb1608		I have to install manually
2009-10-27T23:13:00.000Z	vigo	jhb1608	I purged it and fetched the new one, but that link ubottu gave shows that there is a prettier way of doing it.
2009-10-27T23:16:00.000Z	vigo	jhb1608	I fought with that thing since Feisty, then I learned and figured it out.
2009-10-27T23:23:00.000Z	vigo	jhb1608	Yipee, please post any fixes or stuff on the Forums and Launchpad, Thank you and glad is working.
2009-10-27T23:24:00.000Z	vigo	jhb1608	System+Preferences+Main Menu, is one way.
2009-10-27T23:25:00.000Z	vigo	jhb1608	In that area is also a Preferred Applications widget, is easy to use.
2009-10-27T23:37:00.000Z	vigo	jhb1608	It is mist likely the kernel, 2,##.#,## may not support that one, yet. Or let me look around, did you do an update/upgrade?
2009-10-27T23:38:00.000Z	vigo	jhb1608	and upgrade?
2009-10-27T23:41:00.000Z	jhb1608	vigo	do you meant I have to do apt-get update and upgrade?
2009-10-27T23:42:00.000Z	vigo	jhb1608	I use aptitude but yes, that is the idea.
2009-10-27T23:44:00.000Z	vigo	jhb1608	They are separate commands, do one, update, then after output is finished read it and do the upgrade.
2009-10-27T23:44:00.000Z	vigo	jhb1608	Have you updated or inserted any new keys?
2009-10-27T23:45:00.000Z	jhb1608	vigo	not yet
