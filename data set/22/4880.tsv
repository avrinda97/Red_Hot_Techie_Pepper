2007-10-07T14:13:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	what's your problem related?
2007-10-07T14:16:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	open a terminal, type sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-10-07T14:19:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	install the drivers first, then change that to nvidia
2007-10-07T14:19:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	the restricted drivers manager will automatically change nv to nvidia
2007-10-07T14:20:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	try this, download this http://albertomilone.com/ubuntu/nvidia/scripts/envy_0.9.7-0ubuntu12_all.deb
2007-10-07T14:23:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	no.. not really :(
2007-10-07T14:24:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	videocard driver is autodected at installation.. with feisty video will fail if you hotswap cards
2007-10-07T14:24:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	unless the replacement card is also nvidia
2007-10-07T14:24:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	yes
2007-10-07T14:24:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	it will work fine then
2007-10-07T14:25:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	as long as the driver is the same.. it should be ok
2007-10-07T14:25:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	yes
2007-10-07T14:26:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	your computer has serious issues
2007-10-07T14:27:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	so did you try replacing "nv" with "nvidia" ?
2007-10-07T14:28:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	then hit "Control" "Alt" "Backspace" keys to kill X and restart it
2007-10-07T14:28:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	define "failed"
2007-10-07T14:29:00.000Z	Plutoprim1	codename	then your card looks defective
