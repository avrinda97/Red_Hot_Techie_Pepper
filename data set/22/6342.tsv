2009-04-02T00:35:00.000Z	wiseman		Heeeelp
2009-04-02T00:35:00.000Z	wiseman		I can't get something to install
2009-04-02T00:35:00.000Z	wiseman		I open the CD, there's a setup thing, I doubleclick and nothing happens
2009-04-02T00:35:00.000Z	wiseman		no, it's not a windows cd, it's a linux-specific version of some software I need
2009-04-02T00:36:00.000Z	wiseman		I can't figure out where it goes wrong because nothing happens at all
2009-04-02T00:36:00.000Z	wiseman		It's Pro/Engineer
2009-04-02T00:37:00.000Z	wiseman		Pro/Engineer.  Professional level CAD software.
2009-04-02T00:37:00.000Z	wiseman		It's called Pro/Engineer
2009-04-02T00:37:00.000Z	wiseman		the name of the software is Pro/Engineer.

2009-04-02T00:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	wiseman	seems you need to « sudo aptitude install csh lesstif2 portmap » before running the setup program from terminal
2009-04-02T00:43:00.000Z	wiseman	erUSUL	that may have well have been in chinese
2009-04-02T00:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	wiseman	the blog post? or the « sudo aptitude install csh lesstif2 portmap » ?
2009-04-02T00:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	wiseman	according to the blog post i lionked you need those three packages installed before running the P/E installer
2009-04-02T00:45:00.000Z	wiseman	erUSUL	doing that now
2009-04-02T00:45:00.000Z	wiseman	erUSUL	I get an error now, at least now it's doing something though
2009-04-02T00:57:00.000Z	wiseman	erUSUL	Thanks for the help
2009-04-02T00:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	wiseman	no problem
