2007-05-30T05:59:00.000Z	ward_	brk3	WEP?
2007-05-30T05:59:00.000Z	brk3	ward_	wep
2007-05-30T05:56:00.000Z	ward_	brk3	what happens to other computers oconnected to the same router?
2007-05-30T05:56:00.000Z	brk3	ward_	they seem to be fine, im actually the only one
2007-05-30T05:56:00.000Z	ward_	brk3	damn (and range is fine?)
2007-05-30T05:56:00.000Z	brk3	ward_	well, its just my laptop and a home pc which is connected directly
2007-05-30T05:57:00.000Z	ward_	brk3	ah so you're not sure if other comps have the same problem :-)
2007-05-30T05:57:00.000Z	brk3	ward_	yes, like my internet could be workin fine for hours when all of a sudden i can load a webpage. when i run dhclient it seems to work again
2007-05-30T05:57:00.000Z	brk3	ward_	im the only laptop
2007-05-30T05:57:00.000Z	ward_	brk3	your the only wireless client too, right?
2007-05-30T05:58:00.000Z	ward_	brk3	you could check if its the IP lease time
2007-05-30T05:58:00.000Z	brk3	ward_	hm is that an option on the router?
2007-05-30T05:58:00.000Z	ward_	brk3	that should be around somewhere in the webinterface of your router
2007-05-30T05:58:00.000Z	ward_	brk3	yep
2007-05-30T05:59:00.000Z	brk3	ward_	cool will try that. funny it only started happening last night though not sure if maybe someone was messing with the router?
2007-05-30T05:59:00.000Z	ward_	brk3	what kind of wireless security do u use?
2007-05-30T05:59:00.000Z	ward_	brk3	then its possible someone messed with it yes (but still not likely)
2007-05-30T05:59:00.000Z	brk3	ward_	noone would have cracked it though i live in the country
2007-05-30T06:00:00.000Z	ward_	brk3	could offcourse also be a problem with your PC (but i'm still fairly new to ubuntu, can't help with that)
2007-05-30T06:00:00.000Z	brk3	ward_	ya sure cheers for the help anyway
2007-05-30T06:01:00.000Z	ward_	brk3	still if u can find the setting on your router, just check it to make sure :-)
