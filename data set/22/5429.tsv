2008-10-27T01:39:00.000Z	haydn		Hey, Can anyone explain why/how Firefox is playing Flash without a Flash plug in installed?
2008-10-27T01:40:00.000Z	haydn		Why can't I see it in Synaptic
2008-10-27T01:40:00.000Z	mneptok	haydn	about:plugins
2008-10-27T01:41:00.000Z	mneptok	haydn	load that in Fx. what does it say?
2008-10-27T01:43:00.000Z	mneptok	haydn	what does about:plugins tell you?
2008-10-27T01:44:00.000Z	mneptok	haydn	no, that's a single plugin
2008-10-27T01:44:00.000Z	mneptok	haydn	i suggest you look carefully
2008-10-27T01:45:00.000Z	haydn	mneptok	In Synaptic?
2008-10-27T01:45:00.000Z	mneptok	haydn	no, in about:plugins
2008-10-27T01:47:00.000Z	haydn	mneptok	I only see three entries related to flash. One large category for flash and video/flv
2008-10-27T01:47:00.000Z	mneptok	haydn	how many *actual plugins* are listed there?
2008-10-27T01:48:00.000Z	mneptok	haydn	do NOT cofuse plugins with their MIME type associations
2008-10-27T01:48:00.000Z	mneptok	haydn	and the answer to your original question is "you have the Flash plugin installed. that's why you can see Flash."
2008-10-27T01:49:00.000Z	haydn	mneptok	If I have the flash plugin installed then why can't I see it in Synaptic or dpkg --get-selections
2008-10-27T01:51:00.000Z	mneptok	haydn	did you install it with Synaptic?
2008-10-27T01:52:00.000Z	haydn	mneptok	I don't remember
2008-10-27T01:52:00.000Z	mneptok	haydn	sudo updatedb && locate libflashplayer.so
2008-10-27T01:55:00.000Z	haydn	mneptok	Ok so that found it. Now how do I uninstall that. Or do I just delete it.
2008-10-27T01:56:00.000Z	mneptok	haydn	found it *where*?
2008-10-27T01:56:00.000Z	mneptok	haydn	then it was probably installed via the package system
2008-10-27T01:56:00.000Z	mneptok	haydn	why do you want to remove it?
2008-10-27T01:57:00.000Z	mneptok	haydn	killall pulseaudio
