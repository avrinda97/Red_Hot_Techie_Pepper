2011-09-11T14:51:00.000Z	cpfr	superos	hmm it did
2011-09-11T13:46:00.000Z	superos	cpfr	That one might be difficult. Python is an important part of Ubuntu. Maybe you can copy that directory from someone else?
2011-09-11T13:49:00.000Z	superos	cpfr	You have tried sudo apt-get install python2.6 ?
2011-09-11T13:50:00.000Z	cpfr	superos	doesn't help
2011-09-11T13:53:00.000Z	superos	cpfr	Download from here http://pkgs.org/download/python2.6 and install with dpkg -i packagename
2011-09-11T13:55:00.000Z	cpfr	superos	Polah is there a place i can pastebin the error?
2011-09-11T13:58:00.000Z	superos	cpfr	What about unpacking the python2.6 deb package and the copy all the files from it into the directory you deleted?
2011-09-11T13:59:00.000Z	cpfr	superos	good idea
2011-09-11T14:02:00.000Z	superos	cpfr	Don't copy all the files, just the ones that should go into the dir you delted.
2011-09-11T14:27:00.000Z	cpfr	superos	yep no luck
2011-09-11T14:34:00.000Z	superos	cpfr	sudo aptitude reinstall python2.6
2011-09-11T14:35:00.000Z	cpfr	superos	python installs fine now but when i try to install python-apt or other systems essentials it doesnt seem to install them in /usr/lib/python2.6
2011-09-11T14:35:00.000Z	superos	cpfr	What Ubuntu version?
2011-09-11T14:37:00.000Z	superos	cpfr	Isn't 2.7 the default in 10.10?
2011-09-11T14:38:00.000Z	cpfr	superos	nope 2.6 is this default for 10.10
2011-09-11T14:40:00.000Z	superos	cpfr	apt-cache show python-apt  copy output to a pastebin please
2011-09-11T14:50:00.000Z	superos	cpfr	Sure it does not install into /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/ ? Sorry for asking you again.
2011-09-11T14:53:00.000Z	superos	cpfr	Tried dpgk --configure -a ?
2011-09-11T14:54:00.000Z	superos	cpfr	apt-get clean, then configure and last force install is what I usually try. Too bad it not works in this case.
2011-09-11T14:56:00.000Z	cpfr	superos	i think i might need to just burn a cd and reinstall over all this
2011-09-11T14:57:00.000Z	superos	cpfr	Yes :-(
2011-09-11T18:32:00.000Z	cpfr	superos	fixed it
