2008-11-14T11:14:00.000Z	matthew		what is the issue uep ?
2008-11-14T11:14:00.000Z	uep	matthew	I have installed ubuntu 8.10.  It does not seem to be installing  grub correctly.  I found this page https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub/+bug/253323 that seems to specify a related problem.  How do I fix it?  I've noticed that my target partition has neither grub nor initrd on it.
2008-11-14T11:16:00.000Z	matthew	uep	I did the whole process
2008-11-14T11:21:00.000Z	uep	matthew	how do I install grub when it's not installed anywhere?
2008-11-14T11:21:00.000Z	matthew	uep	idk
2008-11-14T11:23:00.000Z	matthew	uep	did you ever have grub installed ?
2008-11-14T11:24:00.000Z	uep	matthew	It still seems to be sitting there in the master boot record, but *not* on the partition.
2008-11-14T11:24:00.000Z	uep	matthew	I actually installed it fresh instead of upgrading.
2008-11-14T11:25:00.000Z	uep	matthew	I've tried running grub-update, but it seems to want to find the grub files in the root partition, instead of at target.
2008-11-14T11:26:00.000Z	uep	matthew	The alternate disk image.  I didn't mount my other partitions as writeable is all.
2008-11-14T11:26:00.000Z	uep	matthew	since I'm running from the live cd still.
2008-11-14T12:12:00.000Z	uep	matthew	Thanks for your help earlier.  I'm going to try the alternate disc tomorrow.  I've given up trying to get the regular disc to work.
2008-11-14T12:12:00.000Z	matthew	uep	it is nice and updates everything
