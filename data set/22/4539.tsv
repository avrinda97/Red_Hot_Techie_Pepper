2008-01-11T05:55:00.000Z	BB88		Hello. Does anybody have any experience with VirtualBox OSE?
2008-01-11T05:55:00.000Z	BB88		How can I do this "Make sure that the user has write permissions for /dev/vboxdrv by adding them to the vboxusers groups."  ?
2008-01-11T05:55:00.000Z	peabody	BB88	Not OSE, but I don't think they're too different, other than the USB support
2008-01-11T05:56:00.000Z	BB88	peabody	How can I do this, Make sure that the user has write permissions for /dev/vboxdrv by adding them to the vboxusers groups?
2008-01-11T05:56:00.000Z	peabody	BB88	Do you know how to change a file's mode? (chmod command)
2008-01-11T05:56:00.000Z	BB88	peabody	Like 775 ?
2008-01-11T05:56:00.000Z	peabody	BB88	yeah, that's part of it
2008-01-11T05:56:00.000Z	BB88	peabody	Probably be better if you just tell me word for word then =)
2008-01-11T05:58:00.000Z	BB88	peabody	Any ideas then?
2008-01-11T05:59:00.000Z	peabody	BB88	Sorry about that, got distracted...If I remember correctly, when I installed Virtual box, I remember creating a vboxusers group and adding myself to it.
2008-01-11T06:00:00.000Z	BB88	peabody	Can I not just do that through Users and Groups?
2008-01-11T06:39:00.000Z	BB88	peabody	Any ideas how to share folders between Guest and Host?
2008-01-11T06:39:00.000Z	peabody	BB88	sure, through smb or nfs, what do you need?
2008-01-11T06:40:00.000Z	BB88	peabody	Well I am just trying to share a folder, so I can install VB6 on XP through the Virtual thing?
2008-01-11T06:45:00.000Z	BB88	peabody	Any luck?
2008-01-11T06:45:00.000Z	peabody	BB88	Sorry, what did you need again?
2008-01-11T06:46:00.000Z	BB88	peabody	 Well I am just trying to share a folder, so I can install VB6 on XP through the Virtual thing?
2008-01-11T06:46:00.000Z	peabody	BB88	Oh, I haven't haven't messed with shared folders in virtual box.  Sorry, thought you meant in ubuntu in general
2008-01-11T06:46:00.000Z	peabody	BB88	However, from my understanding it's not very hard.
2008-01-11T06:47:00.000Z	BB88	peabody	So it seems, but not having much luck.
2008-01-11T06:51:00.000Z	BB88	peabody	Try looking at this link http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VirtualBox#Sharing_folders_between_the_host_and_the_guest I am just flat out confused! =)
2008-01-11T06:53:00.000Z	BB88	peabody	Any ideas from that link then?
