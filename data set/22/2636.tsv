2009-04-21T23:53:00.000Z	el_-		hi: did any of you have the problem with 7.10 server that it freezes with ubuntu server hangs  openbsd secure shell server's configuration sshd
2009-04-21T23:54:00.000Z	Gnea	el_-	not that I recall, but 7.10 is no longer supported anyway. 8.04 would be a good upgrade.
2009-04-21T23:55:00.000Z	el_-	Gnea	sure.. but all my data is on that box
2009-04-21T23:56:00.000Z	Gnea	el_-	I don't understand what the problem is... you don't have backups or you haven't ever done an upgrade before? the upgrade will not damage your data, if you do it right (and the instructions are very precise, so it's hard to do it wrong)
2009-04-21T23:57:00.000Z	el_-	Gnea	It is a Server right... the last backup is three days old, I cannot boot into the box to rescue the data
2009-04-21T23:57:00.000Z	Gnea	el_-	I still don't see the problem. can you elaborate?
2009-04-21T23:58:00.000Z	el_-	Gnea	Ok its a bit complicated... still in the main
2009-04-21T23:58:00.000Z	Gnea	el_-	just skip the details and get down to the nitty-gritty :)
2009-04-21T23:59:00.000Z	Gnea	el_-	for instance: WHY can't you boot the box into rescue mode? What's preventing that?
2009-04-22T00:00:00.000Z	Gnea	el_-	alright, can you boot into a livecd on the new machine?
2009-04-22T00:01:00.000Z	el_-	Gnea	Until  openbsd secure shell server's configuration sshd
2009-04-22T00:02:00.000Z	Gnea	el_-	does it just freeze, or..?
2009-04-22T00:03:00.000Z	el_-	Gnea	yes
2009-04-22T00:03:00.000Z	Gnea	el_-	tried ctrl-c?
2009-04-22T00:03:00.000Z	el_-	Gnea	yes
2009-04-22T00:04:00.000Z	Gnea	el_-	gotcha... what sort of difference between the main hardware now from what it was attached to then?
2009-04-22T00:07:00.000Z	Gnea	el_-	yeah, it *should* work just fine like that... I don't know, going to a p3 like that... could be a bios setting is off
2009-04-22T00:07:00.000Z	Gnea	el_-	or maybe the hd cable is a little lossy on this one
2009-04-22T00:07:00.000Z	Gnea	el_-	you could also try pci=routeirq if you haven't already
2009-04-22T00:08:00.000Z	el_-	Gnea	I will try that... check back later
2009-04-22T00:08:00.000Z	Gnea	el_-	cheers
2009-04-22T00:09:00.000Z	el_-	Gnea	Thanks
