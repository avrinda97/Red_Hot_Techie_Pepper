2009-10-03T15:16:00.000Z	jrib	aaron11	I would contact them directly
2009-10-03T15:17:00.000Z	aaron11	jrib	How IRC
2009-10-03T15:24:00.000Z	jrib	aaron11	sorry, this channel is not related to system76 at all.  But they have an active section at ubuntuforums that is monitered by the company.  I suggest you use e-mail to contact them however
2009-12-14T22:18:00.000Z	jrib	aaron11	best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
2009-12-14T22:19:00.000Z	aaron11	jrib	What do you mean? I just gave all my details
2009-12-14T22:19:00.000Z	jrib	aaron11	I mean please don't follow your question with pleas for help
2009-12-14T22:20:00.000Z	aaron11	jrib	Well I hardely have time. Forget that do you know the answer?
2009-12-14T22:22:00.000Z	jrib	aaron11	everyone's question is important.  Following your question with "please help me", "I really need this", and similar isn't productive.  It just contributes noise to the channel
2009-12-14T22:22:00.000Z	jrib	aaron11	if I know the answer to your question, I will try to help you
2009-12-14T22:25:00.000Z	jrib	aaron11	check for firewall issues
2009-12-14T22:25:00.000Z	aaron11	jrib	On Ubuntu its off
2009-12-14T22:25:00.000Z	jrib	aaron11	on the server?
2009-12-14T22:26:00.000Z	aaron11	jrib	BTW is there gona be hackers tring to get through my system on Ubuntu
2009-12-14T22:27:00.000Z	jrib	aaron11	maybe though it's not really something you have to worry about unless you start exposing services to the outside world (by default ubuntu does not run any services exposed to the outside world).  Otherwise, just stick to software from trusted repositories and you will be fine
