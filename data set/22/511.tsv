2011-11-08T23:23:00.000Z	n0yd		I'm just a bit confused, long time linux user, havent used Ubuntu in ages though....
2011-11-08T23:24:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	what are you confused about
2011-11-08T23:24:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	its gnome 3 fallback, not gnome 2.. thats why
2011-11-08T23:25:00.000Z	n0yd	Gentoo64	gotcha. how do i acquire gnome2?
2011-11-08T23:25:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	you cant easily
2011-11-08T23:25:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	gnome 2 is gone and gnome 3 has taken over now
2011-11-08T23:25:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	or use a different de
2011-11-08T23:25:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	try xfce with 2 panels...
2011-11-08T23:26:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	yeah a lot of people like gnome 2, but thats the way it is now
2011-11-08T23:26:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	arch has had gnome 3 for over  ayear now....
2011-11-08T23:27:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	unless you like constantly having to block new packages i would use gnome 3 or something else
2011-11-08T23:27:00.000Z	n0yd	Gentoo64	i know it has, but my boxen still has gnome2 installed. i never upgraded
2011-11-08T23:27:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	xfce with 2 panels is similar to gnome 2 (a bit) at least that way you can upgrade as usual
2011-11-08T23:28:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	so whats the problem :s
2011-11-08T23:28:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	11.04 was gnome 2
2011-11-08T23:29:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	yeah but it has classic mode
2011-11-08T23:29:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	and they hate the new look?
2011-11-08T23:29:00.000Z	n0yd	Gentoo64	i donno yet :P But I do ;)
2011-11-08T23:30:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	no need to rant then :) if you dont use it...
2011-11-08T23:37:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	dont see why you're complaining... you said the comp was for someone else who hasnt even seen it yet. and you use arch...
2011-11-08T23:37:00.000Z	Gentoo64	n0yd	so who cares
