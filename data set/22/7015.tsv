2006-06-12T09:51:00.000Z	drumline_	n30n	AMD's answer to Intel's VT.   It's the tech that significantly lowers the overhead on running virtual operating systems.  It is in all AM2 socket chips and Intel's newer chips..
2006-06-12T09:51:00.000Z	n30n	drumline_	i see.
2006-06-12T09:52:00.000Z	drumline_	n30n	instead of 30% overhead, it's down to 5%...   pretty sweet stuff.  Anyway...  with a dual core, it'll be a breeze to run 3-4 operating systems at once...    And when the quad cores come out later this year, the sky will be the limit...
2006-06-12T09:53:00.000Z	n30n	drumline_	sweetness
