2011-01-27T13:13:00.000Z	m1ndvirus		Why does /etc/init.d/networking fail when /etc/network/interfaces contains the following line at the end: "post-up /etc/network/if-up.d/zoneedit"? I have an /etc/network/if-up.d/zoneedit file marked +x.
2011-01-27T13:14:00.000Z	Gnea	m1ndvirus	who owns zoneedit?
2011-01-27T13:15:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	Gnea	Zoneedit?
2011-01-27T13:15:00.000Z	Gnea	m1ndvirus	yes.
2011-01-27T13:16:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	Gnea	root:root with permissions 700.
2011-01-27T13:16:00.000Z	Gnea	m1ndvirus	okay, what happens if you change it to 755?
2011-01-27T13:16:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	Gnea	Same thing.
2011-01-27T13:17:00.000Z	Gnea	m1ndvirus	would you mind pastebining the contents of the file?
2011-01-27T13:17:00.000Z	Gnea	m1ndvirus	ah, you need to make it a proper shell script
2011-01-27T13:17:00.000Z	Gnea	m1ndvirus	add this to the top of the file:  #!/bin/sh
2011-01-27T13:18:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	Gnea	Failed againl.
2011-01-27T13:18:00.000Z	Gnea	m1ndvirus	even if you run it on its own?
2011-01-27T13:18:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	Gnea	Nope.
2011-01-27T13:18:00.000Z	Gnea	m1ndvirus	'nope', meaning that it failed?
2011-01-27T13:19:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	Gnea	It works running as a shell script.
2011-01-27T13:21:00.000Z	Gnea	m1ndvirus	maybe you need to add an 'exit 0' to the end
2011-01-27T13:23:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	Gnea	Didn't help.
2011-01-27T13:24:00.000Z	Gnea	m1ndvirus	where does the error occur? what exactly are you typing for it to happen?
2011-01-27T13:26:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	Gnea	/etc/init.d/networking restart.
2011-01-27T13:28:00.000Z	Gnea	m1ndvirus	have you tried it with just up instead of post-up?
2011-01-27T13:29:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	Gnea	Will do.
2011-01-27T13:30:00.000Z	Gnea	m1ndvirus	go back to post-up and try: service networking stop && service networking start   instead of restart
