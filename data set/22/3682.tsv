2008-10-13T01:49:00.000Z	BlueEagle	FarmCretin	A segmentation fault is almost always caused by broken software. This being a torrent client I would assume a memory buffer is not being properly checked.
2008-10-13T01:49:00.000Z	FarmCretin	BlueEagle	 so should i recompile or somethhing?
2008-10-13T01:49:00.000Z	BlueEagle	FarmCretin	If possible I would recomend trying an older version, another client or (perhaps first) download the torrent from another source.
2008-10-13T01:50:00.000Z	BlueEagle	FarmCretin	I would recomend using the packaged version of rtorrent.
2008-10-13T01:50:00.000Z	FarmCretin	BlueEagle	 it doesnt have xml-rpc enabled
2008-10-13T01:51:00.000Z	BlueEagle	FarmCretin	are you using a stable or unstable source tarball?
2008-10-13T01:51:00.000Z	BlueEagle	FarmCretin	Are you using optimisation flags?
2008-10-13T01:51:00.000Z	FarmCretin		stable as far as i now
2008-10-13T01:51:00.000Z	FarmCretin	BlueEagle	 no idea of optimisation flags. i followed the install tutorial
2008-10-13T01:52:00.000Z	BlueEagle	FarmCretin	Did you pass something like -O3 to the make command?
2008-10-13T01:52:00.000Z	BlueEagle		...or configure
2008-10-13T01:52:00.000Z	FarmCretin	BlueEagle	 no
2008-10-13T01:52:00.000Z	FarmCretin		yes
2008-10-13T01:52:00.000Z	FarmCretin		configure
2008-10-13T01:53:00.000Z	BlueEagle	FarmCretin	Where did you find this install tutorial?
2008-10-13T01:53:00.000Z	FarmCretin		./configure with c++ enabled or something allong those lines
2008-10-13T01:53:00.000Z	FarmCretin		http://www.wtorrent-project.org/trac/wiki/wTorrentInstall
2008-10-13T01:54:00.000Z	BlueEagle	FarmCretin	You're using the svn-version (read: development version) of rtorrent. Breakage is to be expected. Try getting a stable tarball.
2008-10-13T01:55:00.000Z	FarmCretin		aha
2008-10-13T01:55:00.000Z	FarmCretin	BlueEagle	 thanks, i'll get to it
