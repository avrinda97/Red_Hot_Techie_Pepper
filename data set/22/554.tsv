2012-07-15T17:48:00.000Z	jsebean	Scotty_	Is ubuntu on the FAT?
2012-07-15T17:48:00.000Z	jsebean	Scotty_	Windows 7 don't use FAT iirc so it must be on the 49GB NTFS
2012-07-15T17:49:00.000Z	jsebean	Scotty_	The little ones are for swap, so that would suggest Ubuntu is on the FAT unless you're booting from USB or something?
2012-07-15T17:49:00.000Z	Scotty_	jsebean	yeah, i know windows 7 is on that, but im not sure where my ubuntu installation is located, i have no external drives /usb/card reader attached
2012-07-15T17:50:00.000Z	Scotty_	jsebean	3x 4.2GB on a 80GB HD isnt small lol, thats a huge chunk of my drive
2012-07-15T17:51:00.000Z	jsebean	Scotty_	Oh i see, those are part of your drive?
2012-07-15T17:52:00.000Z	Scotty_	jsebean	they have to be, no other hard drive /storage installed lol. But looking, i think my ubuntu may be installed on the 47GB with windows?
2012-07-15T17:53:00.000Z	Scotty_	jsebean	i get in Disk Usage Analyzer; Total Filesystem capacity: 42.8GB (used 17.7GB available 25.1 GB)
2012-07-15T17:54:00.000Z	jsebean	Scotty_	Can you open up the fat drive in nautilus, says it's mounted /host
2012-07-15T17:54:00.000Z	Scotty_	jsebean	however if i go to properties of my /home directory, i have free space 3.8GB
2012-07-15T17:55:00.000Z	Scotty_	jsebean	negative, doesnt show up in Nautilus
