2009-07-12T03:22:00.000Z	Out_Cold		ugh... is there a way to speed up a usb flash OS?
2009-07-12T03:22:00.000Z	tonii	Out_Cold	faster usb-memory
2009-07-12T03:23:00.000Z	tonii	Out_Cold	you wanted to speed it up, I suggested a faster usb-memory.
2009-07-12T03:23:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tonii	you mean a higher priced usb drive?
2009-07-12T03:24:00.000Z	tonii	Out_Cold	most likely it will be more expensive yes. I suppose you feel it's sluggish when reading/writing data?
2009-07-12T03:25:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tonii	yea.. can i write a tmp on the actual HD?
2009-07-12T03:25:00.000Z	tonii	Out_Cold	I suppose, depends if you can partition it :)
2009-07-12T03:26:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tonii	i have full access to it but am currently trying to troubleshoot existing lvms
2009-07-12T03:26:00.000Z	tonii	Out_Cold	ah. hm, don't think temporary writing to the hdd is very temporary though ^_^
2009-07-12T03:27:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tonii	well it's encrypted and going to be overwritten soon lol
2009-07-12T03:28:00.000Z	tonii	Out_Cold	lol ;) guess it's no harm if you mess it up by accident then
2009-07-12T03:28:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tonii	would i just make the drive and mount as /tmp?
2009-07-12T03:29:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tonii	is that where all the read/write is going?
2009-07-12T03:30:00.000Z	tonii	Out_Cold	well, reading occours mostly from /usr I'd guess. writing to /tmp and /var seems logical to me. But I'm no expert on that area.
2009-07-12T03:32:00.000Z	tonii	Out_Cold	true. but why not just install everything on the hdd if you're going to erase it anyway? :)
2009-07-12T03:33:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tonii	well i want a secondary OS for umm... unnamed reasons... but the usb is too slow
2009-07-12T03:34:00.000Z	tonii	Out_Cold	you can dual boot from the hdd, no? :)
2009-07-12T03:35:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tonii	but because of the implications of the type of OS, i want it easily removable...
2009-07-12T03:35:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tonii	and encrypted lol
2009-07-12T03:38:00.000Z	tonii	Out_Cold	Aha. :) Guess you can solve it in some way. I wonder if it's possible to make "ramdrives" in linux as it is in windows, then you could make the mountpoints in the ram (if you have enough), and the OS would be faaaast. Though saving settings might be tough :D
2009-07-12T03:38:00.000Z	Out_Cold	tonii	i was reading that you can do that... but alas nl 1 gb ram
2009-07-12T03:38:00.000Z	tonii	Out_Cold	ah, to bad.
