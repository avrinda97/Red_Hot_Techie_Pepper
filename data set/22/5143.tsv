2007-07-11T10:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arang2	I wonder why the status is "invalid"
2007-07-11T10:28:00.000Z	arang2	Jordan_U	the status is invalid cos the guy who reported it didnt provide a crash stack to the gnome people, and it was more than a year ago
2007-07-11T10:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arang2	Maybe you should re-open it and give them a stacktrace then :)
2007-07-11T10:30:00.000Z	arang2	Jordan_U	im a noob i can barely install things if u help me i  will but i would like to find out if there's a solution so i dont open something just for nothing
2007-10-20T08:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arang2	What GFX card do you have?
2007-10-20T08:33:00.000Z	arang2	Jordan_U	im running Nvidia 6600 with nvidia closed drivers 100.14.19 installed by gutsy
2007-10-20T08:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arang2	Try turning it on in System -> Preferences -> Appearance
2007-10-20T08:34:00.000Z	arang2	Jordan_U	roger on that
2007-10-20T11:16:00.000Z	arang2	Jordan_U	i cant access that site for some reason
2007-10-20T11:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arang2	http://www.getswiftfox.org/
2007-10-20T11:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arang2	Try the .org I linked too, it gives valuable information about swiftfox ;)
2007-10-20T11:17:00.000Z	arang2	Jordan_U	so someone hacked the original site?
2007-10-20T11:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arang2	No, just domain squatted the .org, but this is the one time where I actually fully support someone domain squatting
2007-10-20T11:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arang2	I dont know, and I personally don't care, swiftfox violates the MPL and is probably not even much faster
2007-10-20T11:20:00.000Z	arang2	Jordan_U	ok lesson learned , do u know any way to control tracker?
2007-10-20T11:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arang2	Control in what way?
2007-10-20T11:21:00.000Z	arang2	Jordan_U	it's always there eating my processor
2007-10-20T11:22:00.000Z	arang2	Jordan_U	like 50%
2007-10-20T11:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arang2	There is a preference for it in System -> Preferences somewhere
