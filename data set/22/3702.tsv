2008-06-23T09:09:00.000Z	name_name_		good my internet is back
2008-06-23T09:09:00.000Z	name_name_		wut?
2008-06-23T09:09:00.000Z	name_name_		you lost the game
2008-06-23T09:10:00.000Z	name_name_		!! eh!
2008-06-23T09:10:00.000Z	name_name_		Funnel: any idea what's with my machine?
2008-06-23T09:11:00.000Z	Flannel	name_name_	Its probably mounted read only.  You need to chown the mountpoing before mounting
2008-06-23T09:12:00.000Z	name_name_	Flannel	ok I'll try that
2008-06-23T09:18:00.000Z	name_name_	Flannel	it's mean
2008-06-23T09:18:00.000Z	name_name_	Flannel	I can mod. permission on the mountpoint (after umount) but then when I mount them again it's locked
2008-06-23T09:19:00.000Z	Flannel	name_name_	whats the filesystem you're trying to mount?
2008-06-23T09:20:00.000Z	Flannel	name_name_	Oh.  So its that sort of permission problem.
2008-06-23T09:21:00.000Z	name_name_	Flannel	I guess.
2008-06-23T09:24:00.000Z	name_name_	Flannel	in my nice root browser window it shows the owner for the mountpoint sda4 to be namire (me) but as soon as I mount to there it goes to root
2008-06-23T09:32:00.000Z	name_name_	Flannel	I got the permissions worked out
2008-06-23T09:39:00.000Z	Flannel	name_name_	put them in your fstab
2008-06-23T09:40:00.000Z	name_name_	Flannel	ok.. see a whiles back I tried to get my sys to auto-mount sda4 so I think that where the problem is
2008-06-23T09:40:00.000Z	Flannel	name_name_	fstab should clear a lot of that up, actually
2008-06-23T09:40:00.000Z	name_name_	Flannel	ok.. um where was it?
2008-06-23T09:40:00.000Z	Flannel	name_name_	/etc/fstab
2008-06-23T09:43:00.000Z	name_name_	Flannel	I have it now
