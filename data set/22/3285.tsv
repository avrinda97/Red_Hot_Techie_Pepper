2008-12-15T09:12:00.000Z	Vantrax	mdmkolbe	its not too hard
2008-12-15T09:12:00.000Z	Vantrax	mdmkolbe	thats the user switcher applet
2008-12-15T09:13:00.000Z	Vantrax	mdmkolbe	go open gconf
2008-12-15T09:14:00.000Z	mdmkolbe	Vantrax	ok
2008-12-15T09:14:00.000Z	Vantrax	mdmkolbe	then go /apps/panel/global/disabled_applets
2008-12-15T09:14:00.000Z	mdmkolbe	Vantrax	wait, do you mean run gconf-editor? or something else?
2008-12-15T09:15:00.000Z	Vantrax	mdmkolbe	yep, gconf-editor
2008-12-15T09:15:00.000Z	mdmkolbe	Vantrax	ok, I'm at /apps/panel/global/disable_applets in gconf-editor
2008-12-15T09:15:00.000Z	Vantrax	mdmkolbe	then browse that folder tree i said above
2008-12-15T09:16:00.000Z	Vantrax	mdmkolbe	add the panel ID in there for any one you want to disable
2008-12-15T09:16:00.000Z	mdmkolbe	Vantrax	ok, so how do I find out the panel id?
2008-12-15T09:17:00.000Z	Vantrax	mdmkolbe	should be under apps/panel/default setup/fast user switch/
2008-12-15T09:17:00.000Z	Vantrax	mdmkolbe	the bit that says bonoboid
2008-12-15T09:19:00.000Z	mdmkolbe	Vantrax	ok, the disabled_applets "long description" says I need to restart the pannel for the setting to take effect.  Is there a way to easily do that without logging out and back in?
2008-12-15T09:19:00.000Z	Vantrax	mdmkolbe	nope
2008-12-15T09:19:00.000Z	mdmkolbe	Vantrax	ok, well thanks for the help
2008-12-15T09:19:00.000Z	Vantrax	mdmkolbe	good luck, hope it works for you
2008-12-15T09:21:00.000Z	Vantrax	mdmkolbe	what you doing all this for?
2008-12-15T09:23:00.000Z	mdmkolbe	Vantrax	I'm afraid I can't tell you that.  Let's just say it is one more (very weak) layer to the security onion.
2008-12-15T09:24:00.000Z	mdmkolbe	Vantrax	hmm, actually after poking around it looks like /apps/fast-user-switch-applet/show_active_users_only is exactly along the lines of what I want
2008-12-15T09:25:00.000Z	Vantrax	mdmkolbe	could be, you didnt say what you wanted:P
2008-12-15T09:27:00.000Z	mdmkolbe	Vantrax	yeah, sorry if I wasn't clear about what I wanted, but at least you got me heading in the direction of gconf so thanks anyway.
