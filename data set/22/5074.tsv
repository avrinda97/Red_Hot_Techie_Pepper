2007-09-25T16:53:00.000Z	ziroday	phiras	that is not enough to resize, if you want to try another partition tool like partition manager by norton or qtparted go ahead
2007-09-25T16:54:00.000Z	ziroday	phiras	it means not enough space
2007-09-25T16:54:00.000Z	phiras	ziroday	but i have 2.5 G
2007-09-25T16:55:00.000Z	phiras	ziroday	2.5 G free
2007-09-25T16:55:00.000Z	ziroday	phiras	how big is the total drive?
2007-09-25T16:55:00.000Z	ziroday	phiras	please address, have you partitioned the drive already?
2007-09-25T16:56:00.000Z	ziroday	phiras	okay and does windows say it has 2.5G spare?
2007-09-25T16:57:00.000Z	phiras	ziroday	yes it does, and linux say the same 2.5 G free
2007-09-25T16:59:00.000Z	ziroday	phiras	okay can you do this in nautilus
2007-09-25T16:59:00.000Z	ziroday	phiras	gksudo nautilus
