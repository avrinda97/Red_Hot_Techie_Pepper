2006-03-19T16:49:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Agent_bob	before you're logged in - you're a nobody, but still need to be able to read passwd to login...
2007-08-30T14:58:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Frogzoo	fair enough.
2007-08-31T06:09:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Frogzoo	just wanted to say thank you for pointing me in the right dirrection.   i have a sufficiently working bridge now.

2008-02-15T14:04:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Frogzoo	don't happen to know the debian .deb that expands software midi do you ?
2008-02-15T14:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Agent_bob	apt-cache search midi | less
2008-02-15T14:05:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Frogzoo	it's not in the ubuntu repos  so that's kinda useless
2008-02-15T14:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Agent_bob	ah
2008-02-15T14:06:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Frogzoo	i have it in my package cache if i can find the name of it.     it got uninstalled somehow
2008-02-15T14:07:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Frogzoo	but i have thousands of file in my package cache, so i don't know a good way to search for it.
2008-02-19T16:19:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Frogzoo	copy cat.
2008-02-19T16:41:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Frogzoo	kbrooks ?
2008-02-19T16:42:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Frogzoo	ok.  i'll give it a look.   and by messy do you mean setting up or mantaining ?
