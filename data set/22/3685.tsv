2008-07-04T06:56:00.000Z	__yy_		can anyone tell me how to get around this: 'sudo: /etc/sudoers is mode 0640, should be 0440'?
2008-07-04T06:57:00.000Z	__yy_		Additionaly, can someone explain this braindead restriction?
2008-07-04T06:57:00.000Z	Lunks	__yy_	I believe you should use visudo to edit it
2008-07-04T06:57:00.000Z	__yy_	Lunks	which I can't do, becuase I can't sudo
2008-07-04T06:58:00.000Z	Lunks	__yy_	If you can't sudo, you couldn't chmod it or chown it
2008-07-04T06:58:00.000Z	__yy_	Lunks	I changed the permissions using sudo, after the permissions were changed sudo gives that error
2008-07-04T07:00:00.000Z	Lunks	__yy_	Why did you change it? =P
2008-07-04T07:00:00.000Z	Lunks	__yy_	It's good to not broke what's working
2008-07-04T07:00:00.000Z	__yy_	Lunks	because I wanted to change it
2008-07-04T07:00:00.000Z	Lunks	__yy_	well, guess it doesn't work. :P
2008-07-04T07:01:00.000Z	__yy_	Lunks	evidentally
2008-07-04T07:01:00.000Z	Lunks	__yy_	I often try to break things myself too, but looks like you learn what you could from your experience: /etc/sudoers should remain 440 so it doesn't break
2008-07-04T07:04:00.000Z	__yy_	Lunks	indeed, what I am saying is that this is a horrible way for something to break
2008-07-04T07:04:00.000Z	Lunks	__yy_	really awkward, yes
2008-07-04T07:04:00.000Z	Lunks	__yy_	but you have to realise you changed it for no reason. :P
2008-07-04T07:04:00.000Z	__yy_	Lunks	I changed it to add sudo permissions to a user, I have never heard of visudo until just now
2008-07-04T07:06:00.000Z	Lunks	__yy_	I believe I could edit /etc/sudoers using nano
2008-07-04T07:06:00.000Z	__yy_	Lunks	only if you want to cause yourself pain with such a backwards editor
2008-07-04T07:07:00.000Z	Lunks	__yy_	It's simpler than vim for me. :)
2008-07-04T07:07:00.000Z	__yy_	Lunks	yes, the instructions at the bottom are handy if you don't know what your're dong
2008-07-04T07:08:00.000Z	Lunks	__yy_	I don't know how to use vim until now and it's been 1 hear or so using Linux, so I guess you can live with it. :D
2008-07-04T07:09:00.000Z	__yy_	Lunks	try switching back and forth between vim and emacs several times a day and then you will truly know how confusing editors can be
