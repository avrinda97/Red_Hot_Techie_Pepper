2009-07-15T10:36:00.000Z	Ratapoil		i WISH I could reinstal the system but the retards at DELL put /home in the same partiton as / so I can't reinstall without loosng my 300GB data
2009-07-15T10:38:00.000Z	C-S-B	Ratapoil	backup the home directory then format?
2009-07-15T10:39:00.000Z	Ratapoil		 
2009-07-15T10:40:00.000Z	Ratapoil		 C-S-B THAT's what I'll do as soon as I get back home in a month, until then I'm stuck with an unusable keyboard
2009-07-15T10:41:00.000Z	C-S-B	Ratapoil	maybe shrink the / partition, install your new os in the free space and mount your old partition as /home and delete the os files?
2009-07-15T10:42:00.000Z	Ratapoil	C-S-B	 is that 100% safe?
2009-07-15T10:43:00.000Z	C-S-B	Ratapoil	the resizing or the installing of an os on another partition?
2009-07-15T10:43:00.000Z	Ratapoil		resizing
2009-07-15T10:44:00.000Z	C-S-B	Ratapoil	Ive resized a lot of partitions with gparted including ntfs ones, and never had a problem so far. it's down to you at the end but I've never had a problem myself. ymmv
2009-07-15T10:45:00.000Z	Ratapoil		maybe I'll have to do that, cause blinking numlcok is retarded
2009-07-15T10:45:00.000Z	C-S-B	Ratapoil	is an option at least...
2009-07-15T10:45:00.000Z	C-S-B		*its
2009-07-15T10:45:00.000Z	Ratapoil		option involving time and risk
2009-07-15T10:45:00.000Z	C-S-B	Ratapoil	which is fun! :)
2009-07-15T10:46:00.000Z	C-S-B	Ratapoil	the amount of sketchy hacks I've done to get a job done there and then without the proper tools that have suceeded make this look like a cakewalk
2009-07-15T10:47:00.000Z	Ratapoil		what look lke a cakewalk?
2009-07-15T10:47:00.000Z	C-S-B	Ratapoil	resizing the partition and installing an os.
2009-07-15T10:47:00.000Z	Ratapoil		is there a way to do a step-by-step bootup of x-server or gnome?
2009-07-15T10:49:00.000Z	Ratapoil	C-S-B	well, I don't have spare time right now, I don't have empty DVD's, I dn't have a stable internet connection, I don't even have a home, so it makes extensive operations like that extremely unconvenient
2009-07-15T10:50:00.000Z	C-S-B	Ratapoil	dont have a home? I'm imagining you hunched over an overturned bin with your laptop and a 3g card...
2009-07-15T10:51:00.000Z	Ratapoil	C-S-B	I'm squatting here and there.
