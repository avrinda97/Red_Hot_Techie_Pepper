2005-09-06T16:29:00.000Z	vbgunz		the cdrom disappeared from the desktop
2005-09-06T16:30:00.000Z	vbgunz		will try to eject from cmd
2005-09-06T16:30:00.000Z	vbgunz		I love you!
2005-09-06T16:30:00.000Z	vbgunz		:)
2005-09-06T16:30:00.000Z	vbgunz		hey, let me write this down
2005-09-06T16:30:00.000Z	vbgunz		I think the last choice you offered me worked
2005-09-06T16:31:00.000Z	vbgunz		I have one question
2005-09-06T16:31:00.000Z	vbgunz		does the terminal record what I do?
2005-09-06T16:31:00.000Z	vbgunz		I mean since I am new I sometimes need to backtrack what I did
2005-09-06T16:31:00.000Z	geneo93	vbgunz	 yes
2005-09-06T16:32:00.000Z	geneo93	vbgunz	 the uparrow will get it back
2005-09-06T16:45:00.000Z	geneo93	vbgunz	 everything you do in bash will be in bash history and can be recalled at any time
2005-11-04T13:18:00.000Z	geneo93	vbgunz	 do you have accept cookies turned off
2005-11-04T13:20:00.000Z	geneo93	vbgunz	 it saves mine just fine
2005-11-04T13:21:00.000Z	vbgunz	geneo93	I am not sure why I cannot save my Yahoo! login... I am trying so many things and nothing is working... I don't really understand... I have cookies set to on and javascript wether on or off... well, Firefox doesn't save anything... I even attempted to view passwords *but* none are saved :(
2005-11-04T13:21:00.000Z	vbgunz	geneo93	it doesn't save mine at all...
2005-11-04T13:22:00.000Z	geneo93	vbgunz	 try mozilla its faster on this box
2005-11-04T13:24:00.000Z	geneo93	vbgunz	 just delete the moz-ff file in your home dir
2005-11-04T13:24:00.000Z	vbgunz	geneo93	I will try that
2005-11-04T13:25:00.000Z	vbgunz	geneo93	I do not have that in my home /home/vbgunz/moz-ff :(
2005-11-04T13:26:00.000Z	vbgunz	geneo93	I enabled viewing of hidden files... I don't see it :(
