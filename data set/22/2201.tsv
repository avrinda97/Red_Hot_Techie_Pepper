2011-05-01T22:54:00.000Z	newb_		**why
2011-05-01T22:54:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	newb_	What Ubuntu version?
2011-05-01T22:54:00.000Z	newb_	JoshDreamland	11.or
2011-05-01T22:54:00.000Z	newb_	JoshDreamland	11.04
2011-05-01T22:54:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	newb_	Because everything in 11.04 is broken
2011-05-01T22:55:00.000Z	newb_	JoshDreamland	In my PC this work great, but at netbook this happened and I don't know why...
2011-05-01T22:56:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	newb_	Did you update one, and do a fresh install on the other?
2011-05-01T22:58:00.000Z	newb_	JoshDreamland	Update in both
2011-05-01T22:59:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	newb_	That's really odd. Both had the same settings prior to the update?
2011-05-01T23:06:00.000Z	newb_	JoshDreamland	This is the most strange: previous update chrome was working good....
2011-05-01T23:07:00.000Z	newb_	JoshDreamland	I always use chrome, but just now the buttons simple changed their sided :_(
2011-05-01T23:08:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	newb_	Which update? Also, are you sure there isn't a separate setting in chrome that wasn't just misconfigured? (Don't know why there would be)
2011-05-01T23:10:00.000Z	newb_	JoshDreamland	Tried the chrome configurations, but I just found "use system" and "use compact... (default)".  nut now you talked, I will try remove chrome preferences. let me test
2011-05-01T23:15:00.000Z	newb_	JoshDreamland	Reseted all (deeleted folder at home), but dont worked....
2011-05-01T23:16:00.000Z	newb_	JoshDreamland	I will remove .g* folders now
2011-05-01T23:17:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	newb_	What .g folders? The ones in ~/?
2011-05-01T23:17:00.000Z	newb_	JoshDreamland	yes, I have nothing to backup anyway... :(
2011-05-01T23:18:00.000Z	newb_	JoshDreamland	yes, I have nothing to backup anyway... :(
2011-05-01T23:19:00.000Z	newb_	JoshDreamland	do not worked :_(
2011-05-01T23:24:00.000Z	newb_	JoshDreamland	ok ok.... this is kidding me. I removed ALL .* files from my home dir and that buttons are at left side only in chrome
