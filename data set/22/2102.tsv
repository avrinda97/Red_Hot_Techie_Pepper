2009-09-30T21:18:00.000Z	nOStahl		hey guys i just tried booting up my ubuntu laptop and it cant mount the hard drivee. tried booting up a live cd and it wont mount the hd either.
2009-09-30T21:19:00.000Z	mikinanuq	nOStahl	is there anything important on that HD?
2009-09-30T21:19:00.000Z	nOStahl	mikinanuq	yes
2009-09-30T21:19:00.000Z	nOStahl		when i mount it in the live cd ubuntu it says mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda1, mising codepage or helper program, or other error
2009-09-30T21:20:00.000Z	mikinanuq	nOStahl	well it could be that the actual hardware broke or just the partition tables or your file system is hosed, any sudden power outage before this problem started?
2009-09-30T21:20:00.000Z	mikinanuq	nOStahl	any clicking from the hd?

2009-09-30T21:56:00.000Z	nOStahl		i had a power outage on ext4 setup cant boot the computer now. what do i do
2009-09-30T21:59:00.000Z	mikinanuq	nOStahl	you may need to boot to miniPE or puppy, not sure if puppy has data recovery tools. Try to recover what you can then reformat the ext4 in question and start over :(
2009-09-30T22:01:00.000Z	mikinanuq	nOStahl	google  for  ext4 partition repair, you may be able to run fschk on it
