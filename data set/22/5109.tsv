2008-07-31T23:36:00.000Z	olie	soundray	great thanks
2008-08-01T00:02:00.000Z	olie	soundray	Hi me with the monitor again, I couldn't find my monitor in displayconfig-gtk so i choose one that sounded similar and changed the minor refresh rate differences but X won't load the correct resolution. Is there a way to create the modelines for my monitor by hand ? google can't find any either
2008-08-01T00:04:00.000Z	soundray	olie	there is, but that would be skipping ahead. I suggest you look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log and see if any reason is reported why Xorg discards the resolutions you want.
2008-08-01T00:11:00.000Z	olie	soundray	I see that i thinks i got a virtual size of 1920x1080 but i want 1920x1200 as my resolution, i changed the virtual size from 1920x1200 to 0 0 in xorg.conf because i wanted to login, i could not see the login prompt if i didn't set it to "0 0". I get a bunch of warnings like this though "(WW) AIGLX: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x23"
2008-08-01T00:14:00.000Z	soundray	olie	I don't think that warning is relevant -- I see it all the time in the absence of any problems
2008-08-01T00:14:00.000Z	olie	soundray	anything specific i should look of in the xorg.0.log file ?
2008-08-01T00:16:00.000Z	soundray	olie	you don't see any messages about it discarding modes?
2008-08-01T00:16:00.000Z	olie	soundray	it doesn't event consider the resolution i want 1920x1080 is the highest ones it lists
2008-08-01T00:16:00.000Z	soundray	olie	it may be a dumb question, but does your monitor support 1920x1200?
2008-08-01T00:17:00.000Z	olie	soundray	yes if i use a "empty" Screen section in xorg.conf it chooses 1920x1200 :)
2008-08-01T00:19:00.000Z	soundray	olie	so why don't you do that?
2008-08-01T00:19:00.000Z	olie	soundray	because then i get horizontal flickery when i play movies
2008-08-01T00:21:00.000Z	soundray	olie	I'm not sure, but I don't think you're addressing this problem in the right way by playing with the X setup. What video player are you using?
2008-08-01T00:23:00.000Z	olie	soundray	I have been testing VLC, MPlayer and Totem all with different video output and with the same result. The only thing that has worked is setting "Option "TexturedVideo" "off"" in xorg.conf but then the picture gets all pixely and looks even worse then before
2008-08-01T00:23:00.000Z	soundray	olie	which driver?
2008-08-01T00:23:00.000Z	olie	soundray	ATI Catalyst 8.51.3
2008-08-01T00:25:00.000Z	soundray	olie	sorry, I don't think I'll be able to help with your issue
2008-08-01T00:25:00.000Z	olie	soundray	ok, do you know where i can go to find help with this problem ?
2008-08-01T00:26:00.000Z	soundray	olie	I think you should ask in this channel. Do report your flickering problem first, because your X setup seems to be fine.
2008-08-01T00:27:00.000Z	olie	soundray	I did and i got the response that i should try and setup my monitor correctly, well thanks anyway
2008-08-01T00:29:00.000Z	soundray	olie	well, I hope the detour hasn't been totally wasteful... Now at least you know that your monitor is setup fine.
