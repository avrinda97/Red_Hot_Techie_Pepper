2009-07-17T13:39:00.000Z	silvernode		I wish to use gtk-recordmydesktop
2009-07-17T13:39:00.000Z	silvernode		but it fails
2009-07-17T13:39:00.000Z	aftertaf	silvernode	what chipset is it ?
2009-07-17T13:39:00.000Z	silvernode	aftertaf	Oh shiii I forgot. What's the cammand for terminal again? lsusb?
2009-07-17T13:40:00.000Z	aftertaf	silvernode	not near enough awake to tell you ;)
2009-07-17T13:40:00.000Z	aftertaf	silvernode	look here http://stemp.wordpress.com/2008/09/15/intrepid-les-webcams-et-les-drivers-gspca/
2009-07-17T13:40:00.000Z	silvernode	aftertaf	shii umm drink 5 hour energy rofl
2009-07-17T13:41:00.000Z	aftertaf	silvernode	lsusb should tell you. I have a creative vistacam and before i had to use the hacked ov511 jpeg kernel module, but not works with gspca . . . .
2009-07-17T13:42:00.000Z	aftertaf		but now works, i should say !!! ;)
2009-07-17T13:43:00.000Z	silvernode	aftertaf	I see. Well btw i am comming from Arch Linux since compiz is a pain there for nvidia cards...although I must admit if it were not for Arch I would not have learned things like lsusb
2009-07-17T13:43:00.000Z	aftertaf		we all have command line goodness waiting to be discovered . . ..  :)

2009-07-17T13:47:00.000Z	aftertaf	silvernode	sorry, link was in french :).... you should have vendor ID and hardware ID : 0x046d  0x08d9
2009-07-17T13:50:00.000Z	silvernode	aftertaf	Do i really need that? Skype works in 9.04 which is what I have but gtk-mydesktop fails
2009-07-17T13:51:00.000Z	aftertaf	silvernode	so its not stricly a webcam issue, then.. it works, but not with mydesktop...
2009-07-17T13:51:00.000Z	silvernode	aftertaf	true
2009-07-17T13:52:00.000Z	aftertaf	silvernode	ok. no idea in that case, but good thing your cam works ;) is there a channel for gtk-mydesktop you can try in that case ?
2009-07-17T13:52:00.000Z	aftertaf		sounds like a specific issue
2009-07-17T13:53:00.000Z	silvernode	aftertaf	let me make this more specific. When using skype, Audio is the only thing that works. Video crashes skype. In 8.04 things work just fine. Couldn't download 8.04 because everything mirror on the ubuntu website was 404.
