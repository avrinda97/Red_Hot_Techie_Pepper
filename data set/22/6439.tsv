2006-10-22T07:56:00.000Z	deadhobo1	LjL	whoops, ok, thanks
2006-10-22T07:57:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo1	too bad. i'm sorry you were tricked into using automatix in the first place.
2006-10-22T07:58:00.000Z	deadhobo1	LjL	that bad?
2006-10-22T07:58:00.000Z	deadhobo1	LjL	lifehacker reccomended it for getting MP3/DVD support :/
2006-10-22T07:59:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo1	yes. we keep getting complains about automatix breaking systems, and apparently the only thing that the developers do about it is to refrain from giving help to anybody who comes from the #ubuntu channel.
2006-10-22T07:59:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo1	then please tell him to not recommend it anymore, at least not on this channel.
2006-10-22T07:59:00.000Z	deadhobo1	LjL	its a popular blog :p www.lifehacker.com
2006-10-22T08:00:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo1	anyway, tell me precisely what error you're having. i doubt i can find a fix easily, but i will try.
2006-10-22T08:01:00.000Z	deadhobo1	LjL	Well, there is no error unfortionatley. Otherwise I would just google it. All that comes up is a grey screen which looks almost like a background, but the login window never appears
2006-10-22T08:01:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo1	ah - i was under the impression that the system didn't even begin starting. so, it starts, and boots, but when it tries to load X (i.e. the graphical interface with the login script), it fails?
2006-10-22T08:02:00.000Z	deadhobo1	LjL	yes, I can hear the login sound and everything, but I can't see anything
2006-10-22T08:02:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo1	then try running "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" (do it from a console -- you can switch to one by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1).
2006-10-22T08:03:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo1	after that, run "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart" to restart X, and see if it comes back to life.
2006-10-22T08:04:00.000Z	deadhobo1	LjL	I'll try that, thanks... brb
2006-10-22T08:09:00.000Z	deadhobo1	LjL	I couldn't really tell what I was doing because I couldn't see anything, I'm going to try fnf's thing now
2006-10-22T08:10:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo1	yes, if your Grub menu doesn't show up by default. start hitting it like crazy as soon as the BIOS is almost going to pass control to the bootloader, and a menu will pop up
2006-10-22T08:20:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo1	"nv" is an open source driver for NVidia card. "nvidia" is the official closed-source driver from NVidia. the latter is faster for 3D acceleration.
2006-10-22T08:24:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo1	it means it'll run dead slow, i'm afraid
2006-10-22T08:25:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo1	i don't know whether the fact that the "nvidia" driver doesn't work for you is due to an incompatibility with your hardware, or due to the fact that Automatix installs some weird version of the driver
2006-10-22T08:25:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo1	well, even if you do it the "proper" way, you might still have some weird driver installed. please paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to the pastebin, and i'll check whether this might be the case
2006-10-22T08:26:00.000Z	deadhobo1	LjL	I can, but if I remember correctly when I exited Automatix it cleared the changes to the sources.list file. Standby and I'll bring it up though
