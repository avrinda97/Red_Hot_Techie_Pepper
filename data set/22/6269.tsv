2008-04-01T03:39:00.000Z	Mark_		Is there an IRC client installed by default with Ubuntu? Can't seem to find it. I'm used to Xchat but all I see in Synaptic is some ripoff called "xchat-gnome"
2008-04-01T03:40:00.000Z	Slart	Mark_	you can install the regular xchat.. sudo apt-get install xchat
2008-04-01T03:40:00.000Z	Mark_	Slart	roger that slart
2008-04-01T03:42:00.000Z	Slart	Mark_	xchat should be in the "Applications" menu.. under "Internet"
2008-04-01T03:42:00.000Z	Mark_	Slart	not there, checked
2008-04-01T03:42:00.000Z	Slart	Mark_	hmm.. well.. try pressing alt+f2 then.. write "xchat" there
2008-04-01T03:42:00.000Z	Slart	Mark_	icons get lost sometimes..
2008-04-01T03:42:00.000Z	Mark_	Slart	file could not be found
2008-04-01T03:43:00.000Z	Slart	Mark_	did you install xchat?
2008-04-01T03:43:00.000Z	Mark_	Slart	lol
2008-04-01T03:46:00.000Z	Slart	Mark_	open a terminal, type "sudo apt-get install xchat", if that doesn't give you any errors try looking in the menus again
2008-04-01T03:47:00.000Z	Mark_	Slart	installing now
2008-04-01T03:48:00.000Z	Mark_	Slart	BTW I cannot do SU -l in my terminal, it's not accepting the same password i use for sudo. What's up with that? Is there a default SU password?
2008-04-01T03:48:00.000Z	Slart	Mark_	don't use su.. use sudo
2008-04-01T03:49:00.000Z	Slart	Mark_	well.. since ubuntu doesn't really use the root password.. su is bad..
2008-04-01T03:50:00.000Z	Slart	Mark_	if you really really really (and even if you get this far, think again) need su.. you can use "sudo -i"
2008-04-01T03:51:00.000Z	Mark_	Slart	xchat engaged!
2008-04-01T03:52:00.000Z	Slart	Mark_	and now the shortcut is available in the "Internet" menu?
2008-04-01T03:52:00.000Z	Mark_	Slart	indded
2008-04-01T03:52:00.000Z	Mark_	Slart	yes
2008-04-01T03:52:00.000Z	Slart	Mark_	then I can go to bed and sleep well, knowing we've solved that little problem =)
2008-04-01T03:53:00.000Z	Mark_	Slart	lol thanks
