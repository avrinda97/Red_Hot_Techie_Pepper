2010-07-28T02:16:00.000Z	niks1608		!printer
2010-07-28T02:16:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	sorry, don't know what's wrong with ubottu
2010-07-28T02:17:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	if you go with hplip you should be fine
2010-07-28T02:19:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	better to talk here, in case it helps someone else
2010-07-28T02:20:00.000Z	niks1608	Gnea	ok
2010-07-28T02:21:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	did you run hp-setup
2010-07-28T02:22:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	yeah, the 1350 and 1315 are part of that 'series' of the 1300. I've got one sitting next to me.
2010-07-28T02:23:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	really?
2010-07-28T02:25:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	is the printer plugged directly into a usb port on the computer or through a usb hub?
2010-07-28T02:26:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	ooooh, that's a different story now
2010-07-28T02:27:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	ok, how is it being shared? via another linux with samba or windows sharing?
2010-07-28T02:30:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	and how are you interfacing with samba to get it talking to the printer on the network?
2010-07-28T02:33:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	are you using swat?
2010-07-28T02:34:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	basically it's a web-gui frontend to configuring samba. it's extremely powerful and gives you access to options you didn't know existed
2010-07-28T02:35:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	I've used swat for years and there are options there that I *still* don't know what they do lol
2010-07-28T02:36:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	I doubt that, because in order for your Ubuntu system to even know about the printer on the network, it needs to be pointed at it. SWAT can help you do that seamlessly.
2010-07-28T02:37:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	between SWAT and hp-setup, you should be able to locate and setup the printer correctly
2010-07-28T02:38:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	which driver did you choose?
2010-07-28T02:39:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	but what is the name of the PPD file?
2010-07-28T02:40:00.000Z	Gnea	niks1608	ls -l /etc/cups/ppd/
