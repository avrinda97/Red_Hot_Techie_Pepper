2008-02-28T19:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Isoplast	to direct your answer to the right nick, use tab completion on the nickname
2008-02-28T19:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Isoplast	otherwise your answers get lost in the flow
2008-02-28T19:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Isoplast	 for example thore <tab> etc  :)
2008-02-28T19:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Isoplast	first few letters, then hit ab
2008-02-28T19:57:00.000Z	Isoplast	thoreauputic	 a ... geniously!

2008-02-28T19:58:00.000Z	Isoplast	thoreauputic	 and can i highlight the things that get written to me too?
2008-02-28T19:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Isoplast	what client are you using?
2008-02-28T19:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Isoplast	try xchat if you aren't using it - pretty easy and better than pidgin for IRC, for example
2008-02-28T19:59:00.000Z	Isoplast	thoreauputic	im using pidgin
2008-02-28T19:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Isoplast	 install xchat
2008-02-28T20:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Isoplast	much better for IRC - look in add/remove applications
