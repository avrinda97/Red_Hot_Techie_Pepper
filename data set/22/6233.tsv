2008-02-10T10:58:00.000Z	_Oz_		no big deal
2008-02-10T11:00:00.000Z	_Oz_		I need to start learning some command line basics
2008-02-10T11:00:00.000Z	_Oz_		I'm really good at copying at pasting into the terminal window
2008-02-10T11:00:00.000Z	_Oz_		but I need to learn what the hell it all means
2008-02-10T11:01:00.000Z	_Oz_		my biggest discomfort at this point comes from simply not understanding, exactly, the file structure
2008-02-10T11:01:00.000Z	_Oz_		I don't understand where things go when they're installed
2008-02-10T11:01:00.000Z	_Oz_		in windows, it's simple
2008-02-10T11:01:00.000Z	_Oz_		they go in c:/program files and some dlls get dumped into /windows
2008-02-10T11:01:00.000Z	_Oz_		in linux, I have no friggin' idea
2008-02-10T11:01:00.000Z	_Oz_		and I don't really get the "package" concept either -- is it like a zip?
2008-02-10T11:02:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_Oz_	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard
2008-02-11T10:08:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_Oz_	on the same subnet?
2008-02-11T10:08:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_Oz_	their ip addresses have the same first 3 octets?
2008-02-11T10:09:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_Oz_	can they ping eachother by ip?
2008-02-11T10:10:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_Oz_	sure, use sudo though
2008-02-11T10:11:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_Oz_	at the top, where it has 127....   under that put 192.168.1.5    <hostname>
2008-02-11T10:12:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_Oz_	yea, the 127 is localhost
2008-02-11T10:12:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_Oz_	thats fine, just put an entry under them
2008-02-11T10:13:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_Oz_	for the ip and hostname of the other one
2008-02-11T10:13:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_Oz_	then you can refer to it by hostname, otherwise just use the ip
2008-02-11T10:13:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_Oz_	yes
2008-02-11T10:14:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_Oz_	now try whatever you were doing before, i have no idea what that was lol
