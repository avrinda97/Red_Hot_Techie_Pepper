2010-02-19T13:35:00.000Z	justin22885		im doing that now.. its download and installing the base system now
2010-02-19T13:35:00.000Z	justin22885		my laptop uses wifi, so i had to share internet with my desktop
2010-02-19T13:36:00.000Z	justin22885		im trying to decide exactly what to install after the base command line system is up and running
2010-02-19T13:37:00.000Z	justin22885		which distro did you use actionparsnip?
2010-02-19T13:37:00.000Z	justin22885		i have 1gb RAM and a 1.6ghz cpu
2010-02-19T13:37:00.000Z	justin22885		this is a netbook
2010-02-19T13:38:00.000Z	justin22885		the LXDE screenshots remind me of windows xp
2010-02-19T13:39:00.000Z	justin22885		maybe, lightness is a good idea, though this netbook will run windows 7 and vista, id like to keep it to windows xp or lesser level of latency
2010-02-19T13:41:00.000Z	justin22885		actionparsnip: youre throwing a lot of terms at me, lxde, flwm, xdm.. whatever happened to simple fluxbox?
2010-02-19T13:42:00.000Z	justin22885		is xdm a login thats unbiased to any desktop environment?
2010-02-19T13:42:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	justin22885	It is CLI, I think.
2010-02-19T13:42:00.000Z	justin22885		then i like xdm... keep it modular, ya know?
2010-02-19T13:43:00.000Z	justin22885		ive never used redhat... i used one of the first fedora core distros for about 2 days though
2010-02-19T13:45:00.000Z	justin22885		im going to need to install wifi.. i have a broadcom wifi adapter, any tips on how to get this properly configured?... my router uses no password, but will only accept devices of specific mac addresses, so no issues there
2010-02-19T13:46:00.000Z	justin22885		once those 256gb SSDs become affordable, im hopping over to SSD on all devices and not looking back
2010-02-19T13:46:00.000Z	justin22885		afterstep?
2010-02-19T13:48:00.000Z	justin22885		to be honest, i havent a clue as to which desktop environment i will use, fluxbox, lxde, gnome, or kde
2010-02-19T13:48:00.000Z	justin22885		ive used all those except for lxde
2010-02-19T13:50:00.000Z	justin22885		ok, the net install disc is asking me to choose a kernal, any suggestions?... 2.6.31-19-386 looks good
2010-02-19T13:51:00.000Z	justin22885		question: will xdm allow me to select from multiple installed desktop environments? so i could install gnome, lxde, and fluxbox and toy around with all?
2010-02-19T13:53:00.000Z	justin22885	alankila	i just want an unbiased login, lxdm, gdm, and kdm are all biased to lxde, gnome, and kde
2010-02-19T13:53:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	justin22885	I thought you picked xdm?
