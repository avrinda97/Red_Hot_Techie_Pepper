2007-07-22T16:35:00.000Z	YossarianFan		*sighs*
2007-07-22T16:36:00.000Z	YossarianFan		I don't understand how to install anything. ;_; I really don't want to have to go back to WIndows. So much drama. >_>
2007-07-22T16:36:00.000Z	YossarianFan		Oh, everything. :)
2007-07-22T16:36:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	you will need to be much more specific
2007-07-22T16:38:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	you don't need adobe reader, you should already have a pdf reader
2007-07-22T16:39:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	just click on a pdf
2007-07-22T16:40:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	have you tried clicking on a pdf?
2007-07-22T16:41:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	pdfs 'just work', you don't need to install anything special, and adobe's reader is rather subpar
2007-07-22T16:42:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	ntfsfix?
2007-07-22T16:59:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	you have entered the wrong path to the file
2007-07-22T05:00:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	you don't litterally type 'local/to/exe.exe' you substitute the actual path and filename
2007-07-22T05:01:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	where did you put the file?
2007-07-22T05:02:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	no i mean, where is the file you are trying to run?
2007-07-22T05:02:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	you just type 'wine'
2007-07-22T05:03:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	you typed 'wine PROGRAM.exe' ?
2007-07-22T05:05:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	program.exe doesn't exist
2007-07-22T05:05:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	'wine' that's it, just type 'wine' and press enter
2007-07-22T05:05:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	it should not be asking about any executable files
2007-07-22T05:05:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	that's normal
2007-07-22T05:06:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	now what program do you want to install using wine?
2007-07-22T05:06:00.000Z	dystopianray	YossarianFan	download the utorrent installer
