2011-10-29T18:26:00.000Z	cristian_c		hi
2011-10-29T18:26:00.000Z	cristian_c		I installed touchegg 1.0
2011-10-29T18:27:00.000Z	cristian_c		but I could not use it because there was no gui
2011-10-29T18:28:00.000Z	cristian_c		so I was told to install touchegg 0.3 (packages touchegg and touchegg.gui)
2011-10-29T18:28:00.000Z	cristian_c		*touchegg-gui
2011-10-29T18:30:00.000Z	cristian_c		But the gestures were not working. Then in a link that was given to me, was written to install touchegg 0.2
2011-10-29T18:31:00.000Z	cristian_c		But even in this case the gestures were not working
2011-10-29T18:32:00.000Z	cristian_c		I point out that every time I install a new version of touchegg, I uninstall the previously installed packages
2011-10-29T18:33:00.000Z	Ampelbein	cristian_c	What do you mean by that?
2011-10-29T18:34:00.000Z	cristian_c	Ampelbein	I would like to make working the gestures with touchegg
2011-10-29T18:35:00.000Z	Ampelbein	cristian_c	ok. Any error messages you get?
2011-10-29T18:35:00.000Z	cristian_c	Ampelbein	even in the case of version 0.2 of the touchegg, I installed touchegg and touchegg-gui packages
2011-10-29T18:36:00.000Z	Ampelbein	cristian_c	The most recent version of touchegg in the archives is 1.0-0ubuntu1
2011-10-29T18:37:00.000Z	cristian_c	Ampelbein	I get no errors, but only that the configuration is written in the configuration file
2011-10-29T18:37:00.000Z	cristian_c	Ampelbein	I had one installed, but there was no gui
2011-10-29T18:49:00.000Z	cristian_c	Ampelbein	What can I do? :)
2011-10-29T18:50:00.000Z	Ampelbein	cristian_c	The gui package isn't in the official archives yet.
2011-10-29T18:51:00.000Z	Ampelbein	cristian_c	see bug 834149
2011-10-29T18:54:00.000Z	cristian_c	Ampelbein	I was told to install the package on the site
2011-10-29T18:55:00.000Z	cristian_c	Ampelbein	I have installed both version 0.3 and version 0.2
2011-10-29T18:56:00.000Z	Ampelbein	cristian_c	Unfortunately unofficial packages can't be supported here, you might want to get in touch with the developers directly.
2011-10-29T18:57:00.000Z	cristian_c	Ampelbein	ok, thanks :)
