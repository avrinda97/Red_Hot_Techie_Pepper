2008-02-21T09:50:00.000Z	n8tuser		nrossin--> when you do   ipcs  how many rows have their last column (status) blank?
2008-02-21T09:52:00.000Z	n8tuser		nrossin--> under bytes how much do they take up?
2008-02-21T09:53:00.000Z	n8tuser		nrossin--> btw, which ubuntu version do you have?
2008-02-21T09:54:00.000Z	n8tuser		Stagger_Lee--> i hope you realized that using your ISP's dns would not allow you to resolve, 192.x ip addresses right?
2008-02-21T09:55:00.000Z	hatter	n8tuser	not true
2008-02-21T09:55:00.000Z	n8tuser		nrossin--> you can try to remove them with ipcrm,  I dont know the options off hand, man ipcs, man ipcrm
2008-02-21T09:56:00.000Z	n8tuser		hatter--> does your ISP address resolve 192.x.x.x addresses?
2008-02-21T09:56:00.000Z	hatter		dns has one purpose, map human readable names to ip addresses
2008-02-21T09:56:00.000Z	n8tuser		nrossin--> go ahead and reboot
2008-02-21T09:56:00.000Z	n8tuser		hatter--> you did not answer me, can your ISP dns server resolve a 192.x.x.x address?
2008-02-21T09:57:00.000Z	hatter	n8tuser	you are speaking of ip addresses,  dns resolves names to ip addresses
2008-02-21T09:57:00.000Z	n8tuser		hatter--> and likewise in reverse noh?  you have not answered my question yet
2008-02-21T09:58:00.000Z	hatter		no an internet dns does not resolve a name to an internet non-routable address
2008-02-21T09:58:00.000Z	hatter		that is not the point
2008-02-21T09:58:00.000Z	n8tuser	hatter	correct
2008-02-21T09:59:00.000Z	hatter		the point is, he is trying to get to his router via an ip address
2008-02-21T09:59:00.000Z	hatter		to which, dns has no part
2008-02-21T09:59:00.000Z	n8tuser		hatter and if he is using the ISP dns server to resolve an ip address thats 192.x.x.x it would not work
2008-02-21T10:00:00.000Z	hatter	n8tuser	 no it doesnt, but no router asks for a domain name.
2008-02-21T10:00:00.000Z	hatter		they need an ip address on the same subnet
2008-02-21T10:00:00.000Z	hatter		which doesnt need any dns
2008-02-21T10:00:00.000Z	n8tuser	hatter	correct, if in same subnet
