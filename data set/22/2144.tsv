2009-09-16T03:23:00.000Z	kikbguy		For some reason opensuse 11.1 fits my screen (but sucks compared to ubuntu in every other respect), and fedora 11 has the same screen shifted to left issue if that helps at all
2009-09-16T03:24:00.000Z	kikbguy		Anybody have any ideas?
2009-09-16T03:25:00.000Z	kikbguy		I think it's pidgin, but I'm a newb
2009-09-16T03:26:00.000Z	durt	kikbguy	check which versions of Xorg are being used and which drivers, oss or restricted. going from nvidia to nv in ubuntu does this for me.
2009-09-16T03:27:00.000Z	kikbguy		do you know how I could go from nvidia to nv/open up restricted drivers from the 9.04 live cd?
2009-09-16T03:28:00.000Z	durt	kikbguy	does the live cd have the hardware drivers gui?
2009-09-16T03:28:00.000Z	kikbguy		yes
2009-09-16T03:28:00.000Z	durt	kikbguy	you could try that, but the setting won't survive a reboot.
2009-09-16T03:30:00.000Z	kikbguy	durt	right, and I can't download the hardware drivers for the livecd because it won't survive a reboot and can't install ubuntu because the screen is still shifted 1/4 to the left in the installation procedure.  I'm definetly in a pickle
2009-09-16T03:32:00.000Z	durt	kikbguy	an autoimage ajust on your monitor won't help?
2009-09-16T03:32:00.000Z	durt		*adjust
2009-09-16T03:32:00.000Z	kikbguy		My monitor does not have that option, it is a 42" lcd tv
2009-09-16T03:33:00.000Z	durt	kikbguy	text mode install?
2009-09-16T03:34:00.000Z	kikbguy	durt	that's a good idea, but once it's installed won't I have the same problem with the screen being shifted to the left?
2009-09-16T03:35:00.000Z	durt	kikbguy	but then you can setup tv out properly?
2009-09-16T03:36:00.000Z	kikbguy	durt	i'm not sure what you mean by set up tv out properly (sorry, I'm a beginner/newb or whatever)
2009-09-16T03:37:00.000Z	durt	kikbguy	I think your prop is getting tv out working right, which may require adjustments to xorg.conf, but the live cd uses something else to configure Xorg, which I can't remember offhand, anyone?
2009-09-16T03:39:00.000Z	kikbguy	durt	So you think I should edit the xorg.conf. file?  Is there some sort of guide to doing that?
2009-09-16T03:41:00.000Z	durt	kikbguy	IIRC xorg.conf is not usable off of the live cd, there is another mechanism is use, I can't remember the name off-hand.
2009-09-16T03:44:00.000Z	kikbguy		Durt, thanks a bunch for trying to help. it sounds like I have a major incompatability between my hardware and ubuntu, perhaps I should just report the bug to launchpad and hope someone takes pity and fixes it before 9.10 comes out.
2009-09-16T03:45:00.000Z	durt	kikbguy	excellent idea.
2009-09-16T03:48:00.000Z	kikbguy	durt	thanks.  I had the same screen shifting to nthe left problem with my 1 year old hp laptop and within a month of reporting it the problem was resolved.  Take it easy guys and thanks again for the help - Adam
