2007-10-19T16:26:00.000Z	stupidgirl		 hi everyone, I have installed gutsy and in adept, I enabled teh universe n multiverse repos and when I go to reload, adept gets stuck on "Waiting for Headers (40%)" and doesnt move, still the same after rebooting, and changing servers etc, anyone know what might be causing this
2007-10-19T16:27:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	stupidgirl	could be the servers are being pounded heavily
2007-10-19T16:27:00.000Z	cousin_luigi		these days
2007-10-19T16:27:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	stupidgirl	is your connection working for other things?
2007-10-19T16:28:00.000Z	stupidgirl	cousin_luigi	yes, everything else works fine, I have tried changing to different servers, I tried a few hours ago and waited for a while, still doing teh same thing
2007-10-19T16:28:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	stupidgirl	does it start to download anything at all?
2007-10-19T16:29:00.000Z	stupidgirl	cousin_luigi	it gets to 40% done downloading headers
2007-10-19T16:29:00.000Z	cousin_luigi		hmm
2007-10-19T16:29:00.000Z	stupidgirl	cousin_luigi	well, "waiting for headers"
2007-10-19T16:29:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	stupidgirl	can you connect to that particular mirror with a browser?
2007-10-19T16:29:00.000Z	stupidgirl	cousin_luigi	o I'll try , one sec
2007-10-19T16:31:00.000Z	stupidgirl	cousin_luigi	yeah I can connect with a browser. I have tried switching to diff mirrors also
2007-10-19T16:31:00.000Z	cousin_luigi		odd
2007-10-19T16:31:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	stupidgirl	are you doing it from console?
2007-10-19T16:31:00.000Z	stupidgirl	cousin_luigi	adept, I also tried in the console earlier
2007-10-19T16:33:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	stupidgirl	I'm sorry I don't know
2007-10-19T16:33:00.000Z	stupidgirl	cousin_luigi	okeyy thanks  8-]
2007-10-19T16:34:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	stupidgirl	reducing the MTU helps me sometimes
2007-10-19T16:34:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	stupidgirl	sudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 576
2007-10-19T16:34:00.000Z	stupidgirl	cousin_luigi	oh yeah alright thnx,
2007-10-19T16:34:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	stupidgirl	but that would imply having a lousy connection
2007-10-19T16:34:00.000Z	stupidgirl	cousin_luigi	yerr neighbours wifi gets kinda dodgy sometimes
