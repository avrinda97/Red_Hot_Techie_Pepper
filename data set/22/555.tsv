2012-03-02T01:45:00.000Z	codepal		ok so now I'm screwed
2012-03-02T01:45:00.000Z	codepal		I used apt-get download libglib2.0-0 -
2012-03-02T01:45:00.000Z	codepal		then ran dpkg -i libglib2.0-0
2012-03-02T01:45:00.000Z	codepal		now synaptic won't do anything cause libgimp still thinks libglib is < 2.30
2012-03-02T01:45:00.000Z	codepal		but it's libglib 2.31
2012-03-02T01:46:00.000Z	codepal		how to remedy?
2012-03-02T01:46:00.000Z	codepal		can I edit the status file somewhere to manually override this?
2012-03-02T01:47:00.000Z	Pici	codepal	Do you realize that glib is an integral part of your system and you risk completely breaking your install by changing its version?
2012-03-02T01:47:00.000Z	codepal	Pici	it's working...
2012-03-02T01:47:00.000Z	codepal		so it's not broken yet
2012-03-02T01:47:00.000Z	codepal		and if Matthias GIMP suggests I can install it, I don't see why it won't work
2012-03-02T01:48:00.000Z	codepal		I can always chroot and unbreak it
2012-03-02T01:48:00.000Z	codepal		just help me tell dpkg it's not broken
2012-03-02T01:48:00.000Z	Pici	codepal	What are you trying to do exactly?
2012-03-02T01:48:00.000Z	codepal		cause it's not
2012-03-02T01:48:00.000Z	codepal		I've installed gimp 2.7.5
2012-03-02T01:48:00.000Z	codepal		it's working
2012-03-02T01:48:00.000Z	codepal		but now dpkg thinks libglib is a older version than is actually installed
2012-03-02T01:49:00.000Z	codepal		I suspect a packaging problem in ricotz ppa
2012-03-02T01:49:00.000Z	codepal		all I want to do is cheat, and tell dpkg that it's got no dependency problmes
2012-03-02T01:50:00.000Z	codepal		s/problmes/problems/
2012-03-02T02:04:00.000Z	codepal	Pici	just used this to fix my dependency problem... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=636724
