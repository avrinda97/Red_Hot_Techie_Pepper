2007-08-28T08:57:00.000Z	cishpix		Please help me....., Can NFS be a PDC Server like in Samba??
2007-08-28T08:57:00.000Z	mono6	cishpix	no, NFS is a little different.
2007-08-28T08:59:00.000Z	mono6	cishpix	yea, NFS is more to share folder and files. it does not really do any authentication like LDAP or AD
2007-08-28T09:00:00.000Z	mono6	cishpix	samba!
2007-08-28T09:02:00.000Z	cishpix	mono6	samba just for linux-windows machines, isn't?
2007-08-28T09:02:00.000Z	mono6	cishpix	no, samba can act as a BDC for Windows machines, even as a PDC-clone when using LDAP
2007-08-28T09:07:00.000Z	cishpix	mono6	does ubuntu support like FDC (fedora directory server)??
2007-08-28T09:07:00.000Z	mono6	cishpix	i am not sure, but i just might say: i doubt it.
2007-08-28T09:08:00.000Z	mono6	cishpix	i would just to with samba. it's really relatively easy to install and their tutorials are great
2007-08-28T09:10:00.000Z	cishpix	mono6	but I know, in linux-linux machine is good to use NFS but in linux-windows machine is good to use samba, isn't it??
2007-08-28T09:10:00.000Z	mono6	cishpix	correct...NFS is better for linux-linux. you can just use openldap to create a directory server for linux-linux
2007-08-28T09:11:00.000Z	mono6	cishpix	it can provide you with a single-sign-on server (like AD, samba, etc), so you don't have to maintain accounts on every machine
2007-08-28T09:12:00.000Z	cishpix	mono6	do you have a link about the tutorial??
2007-08-28T09:12:00.000Z	mono6	cishpix	http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin23/
2007-08-28T09:13:00.000Z	mono6	cishpix	not really a tutorial, but good info
2007-08-28T09:14:00.000Z	mono6	cishpix	but keep in mind that openldap and NFS are two seperate things. LDAP is for authentication, NFS is for file sharing
2007-08-28T09:25:00.000Z	cishpix	mono6	thanks for the link. U mean that, the best way is still use samba like PDC in linux-linux machine, isn't it?
2007-08-28T09:26:00.000Z	mono6	cishpix	linux-windows it is Samba, linux-linux, openldap/NFS
2007-08-28T09:27:00.000Z	cishpix	mono6	I've read the tutorial about NFS, but it doesn't support like PDC
2007-08-28T09:28:00.000Z	mono6	cishpix	right, because NFS does not do authetication (like a PDC), that is handled by openldap
2007-08-28T09:29:00.000Z	cishpix	mono6	Can the other user open the another user data in NFS??
2007-08-28T09:29:00.000Z	mono6	cishpix	it is possible, yes
