2011-03-03T04:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	yes, cheese
2011-03-03T04:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	then why did you question, if you know it?
2011-03-03T04:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	you dodnt answer my question
2011-03-03T04:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	does cheese show you a picture of yourself?
2011-03-03T04:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	also can you use http://pastie.org    and give the output of:   lsusb    Thanks
2011-03-03T05:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	under the application menu someplace
2011-03-03T05:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	do you see yourself in cheese?
2011-03-03T05:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	thats because its not configured
2011-03-03T05:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	can you use http://pastie.org  and give the output of: lsusb      thanks
2011-03-03T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	just copy the text and use pastebin, no need for a full screenie, We only need the text
2011-03-03T05:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	what protocol do you use?
2011-03-03T05:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	amsn
2011-03-03T05:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	but your camera won't work in amsn either, as you haven't configured it
2011-03-03T05:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	if you give the output of; lsusb   we can advise
2011-03-03T05:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	ok its a suyin chip and it's ID is 064e:c116     if you'd use a pastebin like I SAID, you can copy and paste it much easier
2011-03-03T05:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	so now you can use that ID and find guides
2011-03-03T05:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	identifier, its a common work,like a fake ID, or "Can I see your ID please"
2011-03-03T05:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	the ID is:    064e:c116
2011-03-03T05:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Alexander_	use it to find guides
