2011-01-29T10:40:00.000Z	judgepg	madsailor	Aren't you allowed to have 4 primary, and the rest logical?
2011-01-29T10:42:00.000Z	judgepg	madsailor	nice
2011-01-29T10:53:00.000Z	judgepg	madsailor	never seen anyone who'll be willing to drop Windows on a drop of a dime
2011-01-29T10:53:00.000Z	judgepg	madsailor	he must really not like it
2011-01-29T10:54:00.000Z	madsailor	judgepg	I'm dual booting and leary of it myself....started running ubuntu in prep for the BSOD...and when that day comes I'll be following in the same re-partitioning footsteps
2011-01-29T10:55:00.000Z	judgepg	madsailor	lol.  The best way to really appreciate the value of ubuntu is to use it as the primary OS
2011-01-29T10:56:00.000Z	madsailor	judgepg	just waiting for the chance...as a **thank* you to MS
2011-01-29T10:56:00.000Z	judgepg	madsailor	If you're a gamer, or photoshop enthusiast, sure use windows
2011-01-29T10:56:00.000Z	madsailor	judgepg	that's exactly why it's still around
2011-01-29T10:56:00.000Z	judgepg	madsailor	lol.  I guess you don't have Vista installed
2011-01-29T10:58:00.000Z	madsailor	judgepg	win7..it runs what it has to when it has to, but it's no Ubuntu
2011-01-29T10:58:00.000Z	judgepg	madsailor	You know what, I have some respect for Win7 - it's a pretty good OS
2011-01-29T11:01:00.000Z	madsailor	judgepg	it does it's thing great, no question, but ubuntu is yoga master while win (insert version here) has rigormortis
2011-01-29T11:02:00.000Z	judgepg	madsailor	have you tried arch or gentoo by chance?
2011-01-29T11:03:00.000Z	madsailor	judgepg	nope...backtrc\ack in a vm for some fun pentesting, but I do have a free partition available...what's the advantage (and we should take this to ubuntu-offtopic if we continue this convo)
2011-01-29T11:05:00.000Z	judgepg	madsailor	different distro.  Has it's merits.  I think you'd come to understand the underlying system a lot more with one of those two distros
2011-01-29T11:06:00.000Z	madsailor	judgepg	I'll look into it.  Thanks
2011-01-29T11:06:00.000Z	judgepg	madsailor	np
2011-01-29T11:51:00.000Z	madsailor	judgepg	lol at the possibility of oneric octopus for 11.10 in your link
2011-01-29T11:57:00.000Z	judgepg	madsailor	that was pretty fast install wasn't it?
2011-01-29T11:58:00.000Z	madsailor	judgepg	have to admit, def faster than re-part and expand
2011-01-29T11:58:00.000Z	judgepg	madsailor	oh yeah for sure.  And everything is clean to boot.  No messing around with files
