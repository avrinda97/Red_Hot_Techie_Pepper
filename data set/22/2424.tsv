2009-07-11T09:12:00.000Z	rainwalker	KillGorack	what version?
2009-07-11T09:13:00.000Z	KillGorack	rainwalker	Shockwave Flash 9.0 r999
2009-07-11T09:13:00.000Z	rainwalker	KillGorack	hm...adobe's site should have given you flash 10
2009-07-11T09:14:00.000Z	KillGorack		if I "right" click the clip I try to see it's using "Swfdec 0.8.2".... not sure what that means
2009-07-11T09:14:00.000Z	rainwalker	KillGorack	http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/
2009-07-11T09:15:00.000Z	rainwalker	KillGorack	ah, well first install flash from that link, then after you do that open up synaptic package manager and uninstall any swfdec packages
2009-07-11T09:15:00.000Z	KillGorack		aight..
2009-07-11T09:15:00.000Z	rainwalker	KillGorack	actually, just install that flash package first, then see if flash works
2009-07-11T09:15:00.000Z	rainwalker	KillGorack	if it still doesn't, then try uninstalling the swfdec packages
2009-07-11T09:16:00.000Z	KillGorack		gotcha
2009-07-11T09:19:00.000Z	KillGorack		in firefox it still says that Swfdec is still installed... even after I removed it via synaptic
2009-07-11T09:23:00.000Z	KillGorack	rainwalker	thanks workin now..
