2006-08-22T05:50:00.000Z	Warbo	profoX`	Amarok doesn't like my non-MP3/Ogg files. Even if I drag them into the playilst manually, it says "These aren't in your collection" well done, you didn'y add them!
2006-08-22T05:51:00.000Z	profoX`	Warbo	non-mp3/ogg ? like what? wma works fine too.. I don't think I know many other formats :) besides flac
2006-08-22T05:51:00.000Z	Warbo	profoX`	xm, it, and s3m mainly
2006-08-22T05:52:00.000Z	profoX`	Warbo	oh, yea, Amarok could play those before :( but the gstreamer engine seized development, and the xine engine can't playi t yet
2006-08-22T05:57:00.000Z	profoX`	Warbo	yea I know, but in 1.4.x gstreamer will be gone anyway, it's unsure if it will come back or not
2006-08-22T05:57:00.000Z	Warbo	profoX`	I wanted to try Haiku in Qemu, but you need to install BeOS first, then turn it into Haiku :(
2006-08-22T05:57:00.000Z	profoX`	Warbo	wtf?
2006-08-22T05:58:00.000Z	Warbo	profoX`	I know. The CD images of BeOS they offer are not iso format either
2006-08-22T06:47:00.000Z	profoX`	Warbo	dont know what that means, but AIGLX runs fine (very fast! even with video playback) on my ati radeon 7500 (radeon+dri)
2006-08-22T06:48:00.000Z	Warbo	profoX`	AIGLX runs fine for me, but not Compiz
2006-08-22T06:48:00.000Z	profoX`	Warbo	no problems here
2006-08-22T06:48:00.000Z	profoX`	Warbo	I run aiglx + compiz on my radeon 7500
2006-08-24T09:07:00.000Z	profoX`	Warbo	well -- universe and multiverse are alot bigger iirc
2006-08-24T09:08:00.000Z	Warbo	profoX`	I just haven't run Synaptic without enabling Universe before. I only did it just now because I forgot to set a DNS server so apt couldn't load the Universe package list
2006-08-24T11:16:00.000Z	profoX`	Warbo	come to think of it, can't mplayer play flash7 with some codec? and then pull that through -vo aa, and make a lynx plugin :/
2006-08-24T11:24:00.000Z	profoX`	Warbo	you use Moho ?
2006-08-24T11:24:00.000Z	profoX`	Warbo	2D animator ?
2006-08-24T11:24:00.000Z	Warbo	profoX`	Yes
2006-08-24T11:27:00.000Z	profoX`	Warbo	yes -vo aa / -vo caca
2006-08-24T11:27:00.000Z	profoX`	Warbo	and -vo cvidix and/or fb stuff to run directly on framebuffer
