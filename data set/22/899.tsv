2011-01-31T16:07:00.000Z	nicofs		Every time I have to enter my password to allow a program to run with sudo privileges, there is a grey overlay over my desktop - how can i deactivate that?
2011-01-31T16:08:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicofs	are you using desktop effects (compiz) or regular metacity?
2011-01-31T16:08:00.000Z	nicofs	Fuchs	regular Xubuntu - but it's the same in Ubuntu.. it's some sort of system default
2011-01-31T16:09:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicofs	ah, that's gksudo then, not sudo
2011-01-31T16:09:00.000Z	nicofs	Fuchs	yes, you're right...
2011-01-31T16:10:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicofs	run gksudo with the -g parameter
2011-01-31T16:10:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicofs	it should help
2011-01-31T16:10:00.000Z	nicofs	Fuchs	and how do i implement that with all programs in the menu?
2011-01-31T16:10:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicofs	you could set up an alias
2011-01-31T16:11:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicofs	or, the method I don't really like: rename the gksudo binary, create a script named gksudo which executes gksudo -g instead
2011-01-31T16:11:00.000Z	nicofs	Fuchs	rename gksudo and write a script to run that renamed gksudo with the -g option?
2011-01-31T16:11:00.000Z	nicofs	Fuchs	and what would that alias thing be?
2011-01-31T16:12:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicofs	that's something that would work, but I don't like it
2011-01-31T16:12:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicofs	you can create command aliases in your loginshell rc  (probably ~/.bashrc for you), I think ubuntu even comes with a default .bashrc_alias or so
2011-01-31T16:13:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicofs	unfortunately I only have german documentation at hand for it, but you will find something with a search engine such as google for sure
2011-01-31T16:13:00.000Z	nicofs	Fuchs	i'll stick with the script then... doesn't bashrc only get executed when i open a terminal?
2011-01-31T16:13:00.000Z	nicofs	Fuchs	i can work with German documentation *g*
2011-01-31T16:13:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicofs	syntax would be alias gksudo="gksudo -g"
2011-01-31T16:14:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicofs	http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Bash/bashrc#Wie-definiere-ich-ein-Alias-ueber-die-bashrc   there you go
2011-01-31T16:16:00.000Z	nicofs	Fuchs	danke
2011-01-31T16:16:00.000Z	Fuchs	nicofs	there is a german ubuntu channel as well, just as a sidenote.
2011-01-31T16:17:00.000Z	nicofs	Fuchs	I know, but chances to find help here are higher... and normally i do prefer english
