2010-03-26T03:18:00.000Z	Typos_King	xfact	    I'd check under /usr/lib/chrome
2010-03-26T03:19:00.000Z	xfact	Typos_King	There no such folder(s) named 'chrome'
2010-03-26T03:20:00.000Z	Typos_King	xfact	  is chrome running right now?
2010-03-26T03:20:00.000Z	xfact	Typos_King	nope
2010-03-26T03:20:00.000Z	Typos_King	xfact	    can you run it? :)
2010-03-26T03:21:00.000Z	Typos_King	xfact	    once running do a -> sudo lsof -c chrome | grep -i plugin;
2010-03-26T03:21:00.000Z	Typos_King	xfact	   that will show what 'of' open files is using and where the folders are
2010-03-26T03:21:00.000Z	xfact	Typos_King	Yup I can run it, but without any java plug-in where all other browser has java enabled :(
2010-03-26T03:21:00.000Z	Typos_King	xfact	    once running do a -> sudo lsof -c chrome | grep -i plugin;
2010-03-26T03:23:00.000Z	Typos_King	xfact	  another think you may want to try inside chrome is either -> about:plugins    and about:config
2010-03-26T03:23:00.000Z	xfact	Typos_King	Yup, there I can clearly see that java plugin is not listed
2010-03-26T03:24:00.000Z	Typos_King	xfact	  any directories for the say, flash player?
2010-03-26T03:24:00.000Z	Typos_King	xfact	or under about:config it'd show all configuration info
2010-03-26T03:26:00.000Z	xfact	Typos_King	Maybe it's weird but the about:config showing nothing (a blank white page)
2010-03-26T03:27:00.000Z	Typos_King	xfact	    -> sudo lsof -c chrome | grep -i plugin;     what about that one?  does it show a 'plugin' folder of kinds?
2010-03-26T03:29:00.000Z	Typos_King	xfact	  use Opera insead? hehhe
2010-03-26T03:30:00.000Z	xfact	Typos_King	no, not yet unless 10.50
2010-03-26T03:58:00.000Z	Typos_King	xfact	   just a quickie, do you have java installed?
2010-03-26T03:59:00.000Z	Typos_King	xfact	  not the plugin, the actual full runtime package, which is about 40mbs
2010-03-26T04:03:00.000Z	Typos_King	xfact	  that'd explain the no java :), the plugin is just a liason to the app you know, doesn't provide the java functionality though :)
2010-03-26T04:03:00.000Z	xfact	Typos_King	yup, it's doing facebook java uploader is now working....
2010-03-26T04:07:00.000Z	Typos_King	xfact	    run your file manager, nautilus?   in rooted session, right-click the folder/file check the permissions
