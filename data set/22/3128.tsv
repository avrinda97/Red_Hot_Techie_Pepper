2008-11-29T10:41:00.000Z	MFen		please .. anyone.. make the horrible pidgin warnings go away
2008-11-29T10:41:00.000Z	Oneiroii	MFen	What Pidgin warnings?
2008-11-29T10:42:00.000Z	MFen	Oneiroii	every 20 minutes on google talk
2008-11-29T10:42:00.000Z	Oneiroii	MFen	... I have no clue what you mean.  I've never noticed Pidgin doing anything with certs
2008-11-29T10:45:00.000Z	Oneiroii	MFen	https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-lb/2008-August/000166.html
2008-11-29T10:46:00.000Z	MFen	Oneiroii	thanks, but this is not an msn problem
2008-11-29T10:48:00.000Z	Oneiroii	MFen	Can you clarify what the issue stems from, then?  I'm running the current Pidgin on Intrepid now, on AIM, Y!M, FB, MSN, etc, and have never seen a request/notification about a cert
2008-11-29T10:48:00.000Z	MFen	Oneiroii	google talk
2008-11-29T10:48:00.000Z	MFen	Oneiroii	it's the same message, different certificate
2008-11-29T10:51:00.000Z	Oneiroii	MFen	You only have one GTalk account in Pidgin, right?
2008-11-29T10:52:00.000Z	MFen	Oneiroii	i have two actually
2008-11-29T10:52:00.000Z	MFen	Oneiroii	why, is that a known bug?
2008-11-29T10:53:00.000Z	MFen	Oneiroii	probably, i think i copied the settings for one to the other
2008-11-29T10:53:00.000Z	Oneiroii	MFen	Change the server for just one of them to talk.l.google.com
2008-11-29T10:54:00.000Z	MFen	Oneiroii	haaaaallelujah
2008-11-29T10:54:00.000Z	MFen	Oneiroii	it asked me to confirm that one, and now it's done asking me. hooray!
2008-11-29T10:54:00.000Z	Oneiroii	MFen	:)  Looks like Pidgin has issues with multiple certs for the same server
2008-11-29T10:55:00.000Z	MFen	Oneiroii	how did you know?
2008-11-29T10:55:00.000Z	Oneiroii	MFen	I want to say magic, or expertise, but it was really just Google
2008-11-29T10:55:00.000Z	MFen	Oneiroii	i tried google! it did not help me :(
2008-11-29T10:56:00.000Z	MFen	Oneiroii	what did you search for?
2008-11-29T10:57:00.000Z	MFen	Oneiroii	i should have left out 'ubuntu'
