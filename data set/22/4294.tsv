2009-03-11T01:31:00.000Z	emma	rww	not even a change of kernel?
2009-03-11T01:32:00.000Z	rww	emma	tehfalcon: Nope, because all of the non-kernel stuff is 64-bit too. Changing to 32-bit would involve replacing every single package on your system, which 1) wouldn't work 2) would take longer than reinstalling.
2009-09-08T08:00:00.000Z	rww	emma	when I was using Intrepid, network-manager broke all the time. I used wicd for wireless and /etc/network/interfaces for ethernet instead. It's usable on Jaunty, but still somewhat dumb.
2009-09-08T08:01:00.000Z	emma	rww	maybe i should take a shot at upgrading ubuntu then. Oh crap I can't because that requires the internet :(
2009-09-08T08:01:00.000Z	rww	emma	You could get connected via /etc/network/interfaces with the help of http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202834
2009-09-08T08:02:00.000Z	rww	emma	there are a bunch of examples on that post that I've found useful in the past.
2009-11-30T07:31:00.000Z	rww	emma	It pulls stuff from the web. There are some more details at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2009-11-30T07:33:00.000Z	emma	rww	i think what i really want is a command line only. My objective is to install a bare 9.10 so that I can change the sources.list and upgrade to 10.4
2009-11-30T07:34:00.000Z	rww	emma	Try the Alternate CD, perhaps? I'm pretty sure you can select on there to just install a command-line system (ubuntu-minimal + ubuntu-standard, basically).
2009-11-30T07:34:00.000Z	emma	rww	right on
2010-08-06T08:18:00.000Z	rww	emma	do you have the multiverse repository enabled? have you done sudo aptitude update recently?
2010-08-06T08:21:00.000Z	rww	emma	nope. partner is a Canonical repository containing closed-source software. medibuntu is a third-party repository containing various packages that can't be distributed with Ubuntu for legal reasons.
2010-08-06T08:23:00.000Z	emma	rww	xangua ahh.. okay.
2010-08-06T08:24:00.000Z	emma	rww	xangua, im betting the reason that it wasn't finding ubuntu-restricted-extras is because i had not yet done an update.
2010-08-06T08:25:00.000Z	emma	rww	 xangua , i thinki usually i do the updates before I start installing from the commandline and this time i tried sudp aptitude install right off the bat.
2010-08-13T12:03:00.000Z	rww	emma	sacarlson: gparted is on the live cd.
2010-08-13T12:03:00.000Z	emma	rww	im not so sure about that.
2010-08-13T12:07:00.000Z	emma	rww	i think perhaps it is included on the livecd but not installed?
2010-08-13T12:07:00.000Z	rww	emma	correct
2010-08-13T12:08:00.000Z	emma	rww	ahh yeah then, i meant that you have to install it.
2010-08-13T12:58:00.000Z	rww	emma	http://youtube.com/html5, I assume
2010-11-24T10:59:00.000Z	rww	emma	Canonical's HCL list tends to be useful for me: http://webapps.ubuntu.com/certification/
