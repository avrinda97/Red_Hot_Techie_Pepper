2006-08-09T08:38:00.000Z	fuzzybunny		I have something wrong w/my computer
2006-08-09T08:38:00.000Z	fuzzybunny		I actually paid for my OS
2006-08-09T08:38:00.000Z	fuzzybunny		and it works w/o crashing or hangs
2006-08-09T08:39:00.000Z	fuzzybunny		we get that a lot of the time
2006-08-09T08:39:00.000Z	fuzzybunny		about every half hour actually
2006-08-09T08:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	fuzzybunny	  so You cant get into either now
2006-08-09T10:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	fuzzybunny	It saves us a lot of typing
2006-08-10T09:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	fuzzybunny	what ya need
2006-08-10T11:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	fuzzybunny	is that drive ntfs with the xls files
2006-08-10T11:54:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	Jack_Sparrow	yes its a NTFS volume
2006-08-10T11:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	fuzzybunny	they are not in your box but another?
2006-08-10T11:55:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	Jack_Sparrow	yes they're on our Windows File Server, but fail to open over the share...once their copied to the local ubuntu machine they open w/o a problem
2006-08-10T11:55:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	Jack_Sparrow	is there any way I'll be able to open them over the network share?
2006-08-10T11:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	fuzzybunny	I would think the cause is the copy ntfs makes when you open a file but I am probably wrong on that
2006-08-10T12:09:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	Jack_Sparrow	thx for the help I'm going to #samba
2006-08-11T07:37:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	Jack_Sparrow	I just want to open files on a network drive
2006-08-11T07:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	fuzzybunny	I told you my opinion yesterday on that, NTFS ...
2006-08-11T07:40:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	Jack_Sparrow	I had someone helping me w/it almost all day
2006-08-11T07:40:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	Jack_Sparrow	we still didn't get it working...kinda dissapointing since windows shares have been around QUITE a long time now
2006-08-11T07:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	fuzzybunny	have you tried it on a fat32 and not an ntfs share?
2006-08-11T07:41:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	Jack_Sparrow	I'm not going to bend over my entire production network for the sake of a ubuntu virtual machine
2006-08-11T07:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	fuzzybunny	But it would be easy enouhg to test and you would then KNOW where the problem is..
