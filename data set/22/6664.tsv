2006-09-15T13:32:00.000Z	covOPprometheus		what must I configure to get my cdrom working every time I put a CD in? I'm in serious trouble
2006-09-15T13:34:00.000Z	ladydoor	covOPprometheus	what exactly is your problem? please say it out loud instead of just to me
2006-09-15T13:37:00.000Z	ladydoor	covOPprometheus	ok, do this:  less /etc/fstab. do you see a line for your cd drive, which would probably look something like this:
2006-09-15T13:38:00.000Z	ladydoor	covOPprometheus	/dev/hdc       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto 0       0
2006-09-15T13:38:00.000Z	covOPprometheus	ladydoor	already done, it seems to be ok http://pastebin.ca/171987
2006-09-15T13:40:00.000Z	ladydoor	covOPprometheus	are you able to mount cds manually?
2006-09-15T13:41:00.000Z	covOPprometheus	ladydoor	as far as I know: NO, but we might make a test (I'm still a greenhorn in linux)
2006-09-15T13:42:00.000Z	ladydoor	covOPprometheus	ok, try sudo mount /dev/hdb /media/cdrom0
2006-09-15T13:45:00.000Z	covOPprometheus	ladydoor	hmm, this is wierd, it just read the disk, sec, let me try with others
2006-09-15T13:45:00.000Z	ladydoor	covOPprometheus	ok, cool
2006-09-15T13:48:00.000Z	covOPprometheus	ladydoor	mount: you must specify the filesystem type
2006-09-15T13:48:00.000Z	ladydoor	covOPprometheus	uhhh...i really don't know much about the mount command, unfortunately. i'm sorry
2006-09-15T13:48:00.000Z	covOPprometheus	ladydoor	k
2006-09-15T13:48:00.000Z	covOPprometheus	ladydoor	hehe another failed try
2006-09-15T13:49:00.000Z	ladydoor	covOPprometheus	:-(...good luck
2006-09-15T13:51:00.000Z	covOPprometheus	ladydoor	it's not about luck, I need a miracle, hehe I tend to two conlusion for now: 1st - it's a hardware problem and the cdrom doesn't work properly; 2nd - the it's a compatibility problem with the cdrom and the cdmedia (diferent cd-types)
2006-09-15T13:52:00.000Z	covOPprometheus	ladydoor	if I could only know where to look for
2006-09-15T13:53:00.000Z	ladydoor	covOPprometheus	:-(
2006-09-15T13:55:00.000Z	covOPprometheus	ladydoor	hey, do you know how to unmount the same cdrom?
2006-09-15T13:56:00.000Z	ladydoor	covOPprometheus	sudo umount /path/to/mountpoint (usually /media/cdrom0)
2006-09-15T13:56:00.000Z	covOPprometheus	ladydoor	perhaps it doesn't unmount them properly
2006-09-15T13:56:00.000Z	ladydoor	covOPprometheus	hmmmmm
