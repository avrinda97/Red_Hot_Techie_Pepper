2008-09-16T08:20:00.000Z	gbear14275		hey guys, I'm getting LBA and CHS mismatch errors after I partition my dual boot setup and when I rewrite the MBR using testdisk it skips my grub bootloader and boots right to windows...
2008-09-16T08:20:00.000Z	gbear14275		any ideas or anyone come across this problem before?
2008-09-16T08:21:00.000Z	gbear14275		daklan... newcomer to bittorrent huh?
2008-09-16T08:22:00.000Z	gbear14275		what do you consider  "features"?
2008-09-16T08:22:00.000Z	gbear14275		torrents are slow?  compared to what kelvin?
2008-09-16T08:24:00.000Z	gbear14275		well if you can find everything on rapidshare at 1250kbps then i'd go for it then
2008-09-16T08:25:00.000Z	gbear14275		ok, so having problems getting a dualboot online after partitioning... anyone have any dualboot experience in here?
2008-09-16T08:26:00.000Z	gbear14275		kelvin, you ever run into any chs and lba mismatch errors?
2008-09-16T08:26:00.000Z	gbear14275		no, xp first then ubuntu afterwards
2008-09-16T08:26:00.000Z	kelvin911	gbear14275	what?
2009-01-02T13:37:00.000Z	kelvin911	gbear14275	azureus
2009-01-02T13:38:00.000Z	kelvin911	gbear14275	rapidshare or megaupload are faster than torrent shit
2009-01-02T13:38:00.000Z	gbear14275	kelvin911	azureus now has vuze attached to it, and i've tried it twice, without vuze worked great! with vuze was a mess the standalone updater went horribly
2009-01-02T13:39:00.000Z	gbear14275	kelvin911	I would love to know where you got that assumption
2009-01-02T13:39:00.000Z	kelvin911	gbear14275	i have azureus without that vuze thing
2009-01-02T13:39:00.000Z	kelvin911	gbear14275	i can download from rapidshare 1200KB/s
2009-01-02T13:39:00.000Z	kelvin911	gbear14275	i dwonload 700MB movie in 15 min
2009-01-02T13:39:00.000Z	gbear14275	kelvin911	also torrents have the benefit of community vetting
2009-01-02T13:39:00.000Z	kelvin911	gbear14275	can u do that in torrent?
2009-01-02T13:40:00.000Z	kelvin911	gbear14275	i bet u cant download at that speed with all torrent files
2009-01-02T13:41:00.000Z	gbear14275	kelvin911	you are correct, but show me a a rapidshare library as large as the torrent clouds out there and free of viruses and malware and I'll stop using torrents
