2005-06-30T15:14:00.000Z	topyli	learn25	you don't have a virus, that's 99% certain :)
2005-08-11T15:07:00.000Z	topyli	learn25	many ISP's won't accept mail from servers with dynamic IP's (for a good reason). are you sending the mail directly from your server?
2005-08-11T15:08:00.000Z	topyli	learn25	hmm.
2005-08-11T15:08:00.000Z	topyli	learn25	ok, then it's not what i thought
2005-08-11T15:09:00.000Z	learn25	topyli	Do you have a mail server?
2005-08-11T15:09:00.000Z	topyli	learn25	yes, but i use my ISPs server as a smarthost, i don't send mail directly
2005-08-11T15:11:00.000Z	topyli	learn25	with all the spam zombies around, some ISPs are careful with mail from random servers. your domain doesn't sound like any old "random server" though
2005-08-11T15:12:00.000Z	topyli	learn25	depends on how complicated you want to setup your web server =)
2005-08-11T15:14:00.000Z	topyli	learn25	i have no idea. since RH 5.0, perhaps 1997 or so
2005-08-11T15:15:00.000Z	topyli	learn25	well, i don't exactly miss the early days ;-)
2005-08-11T15:15:00.000Z	topyli	learn25	you don't want to setup RH 5 for desktop usage believe me :)
2005-08-11T15:50:00.000Z	topyli	learn25	i got mail :)
2005-08-11T05:49:00.000Z	topyli	learn25	perhaps ubuntu's postfix is only listening on localhost
2005-08-11T05:51:00.000Z	topyli	learn25	in /etc/postfix/main.cf i have "inet_interfaces = loopback-only"
2005-08-11T05:55:00.000Z	topyli	learn25	paste those into #flood or paste.ubuntulinux.nl, never in the channel
