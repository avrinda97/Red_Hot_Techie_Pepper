2006-06-09T11:00:00.000Z	danial		It is kinda a cheap way around it, but it does fix the problem.
2006-06-09T11:01:00.000Z	danial		I thought...
2006-06-09T07:47:00.000Z	danial		Hello, anyone here know if there is a way to get flash 8 working on ubuntu?
2006-06-09T07:47:00.000Z	Warbo	danial	Install WINE and install Windows Firefox in it
2006-06-09T07:47:00.000Z	danial	Warbo	sirius_kr: Wouldn't that run like crap?
2006-06-09T07:48:00.000Z	Warbo	danial	"sudo apt-get install wine" then get the Windows Firefox from getfirefox.com
2006-06-09T07:48:00.000Z	danial	Warbo	I have wine installed, but just not firefox or flash on it.
2006-06-09T07:49:00.000Z	Warbo	danial	Not really. That is what is suprising about no Flash 8 port for Linux, the fact that the Windows one works well in WINE so surely it would be easy (they are skipping Flash 8 for Linux and going straight on to Flash 8.5/9)
2006-06-09T08:03:00.000Z	Warbo	danial	Well you have just been my guinea pig. Now I know it works I'll do it myself :)
2006-06-09T08:03:00.000Z	danial	Warbo	It is really simple, that link shown back a little bit made it really fast
2006-06-09T08:04:00.000Z	danial	Warbo	http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_flash_player
2006-06-09T08:04:00.000Z	Warbo	danial	If you install the trial version of Flash then you get a stand-alone (and not time-restricted) Flash player. I was trying to get hold of it, but Flash 8 doesn't install well in WINE (Flash MX is fine, but obviously I already have native Flash 7)
2006-06-09T08:05:00.000Z	danial	Warbo	Do you know any good way to switch from Linux firefox to windows, without a ton of effort?
2006-06-09T08:06:00.000Z	danial	Warbo	Havent tried installing Flash (The maker).
2006-06-09T08:06:00.000Z	Warbo	danial	You could make a script containing "wine firefox" and put it as /usr/local/bin/windowsfirefox" then make a launcher for it (you know how to write scripts, right?)
2006-06-09T08:07:00.000Z	danial	Warbo	I know I could create one to launch Wined FireFox, but It would be boss to have it all within Firefox
2006-06-09T08:08:00.000Z	danial	Warbo	Perhaps if I used a shortcut extension
2006-06-09T08:08:00.000Z	Warbo	danial	Well I've never tried doing it, and my solutions tend to "evolve" as I do them to fix their problems
2006-06-09T08:09:00.000Z	danial	Warbo	I kinda wanted some way to launch it to the current page I am at in firefox
2006-06-09T08:10:00.000Z	Warbo	danial	That installs the royalty-free base windows fonts. You could do without them by linking Helvetica to Arial, etc. Just that Windows apps expect them to exist as they are the base fonts of windows
2006-06-09T08:11:00.000Z	danial	Warbo	Ahh, seems that the dapper repositorys are not finding them
2006-06-09T08:11:00.000Z	Warbo	danial	They are in multiverse, I know that much
