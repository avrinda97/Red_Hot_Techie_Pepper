2006-06-14T10:09:00.000Z	Cntryboy		I'm about to pull my hair out :(
2006-06-14T10:11:00.000Z	Cntryboy		I'm trying to mount my windows hd.. Now my windows hd has 2 partitions hda1 and hda5<-- (which is storage space)and hda1 is where xp is installed. I got hda5 mounting and working, but for the life of me I can't get hda1 mounted. Does anyone know what my noob ass is doing wrong
2006-06-14T10:12:00.000Z	Cntryboy		same as hda5
2006-06-14T10:12:00.000Z	Cntryboy		are u wanting to know the command I put in fstab?
2006-06-14T10:13:00.000Z	Cntryboy		./dev/hda1       /media/windows   ntfs   user,fmask=0111,dmask=0000   0   0
2006-06-14T10:13:00.000Z	Cntryboy		with out the . at beginning
2006-06-14T10:14:00.000Z	Cntryboy		I guess so I did the steps found here on a link
2006-06-14T10:15:00.000Z	Cntryboy		okay so can I type a command to see what drives are actually mounted to /media/windows?
2006-06-14T10:15:00.000Z	Cntryboy		to make sure that is that hda1 isn't in the same area
2006-06-14T10:15:00.000Z	ic56	Cntryboy	point your browser to http://ca.geocities.com/ic56@rogers.com/65/diskmounter-latest.txt Page down to "Instructions", and read till the next blank line.  Follow the instructions to save and run the file.  It will setup your /etc/fstab and mountpoints in /media so you can see your NTFS filesystems in Places> Computer.
2006-06-14T10:16:00.000Z	ic56	Cntryboy	The script will ask you if you want to enable NTFS write.  Answer no.  If you already tried unsuccessfully to add your Windows filesystems to /etc/fstab , add a -b flag to the script invocation.  I authored this version, so I can help if anything goes wrong.
2006-06-14T10:17:00.000Z	ic56	Cntryboy	ah. ok.  Good for you!
2006-06-14T10:18:00.000Z	ic56	Cntryboy	are hda1 and hda5 the same type (FAT vs NTFS)?
2006-06-14T10:23:00.000Z	ic56	Cntryboy	define "not working"?
2006-06-14T10:24:00.000Z	ic56	Cntryboy	like was said before.  You cannot be mounted read-write in two places simultaneously.  So, you have to umount before you can mount elsewhere.
2006-06-14T10:25:00.000Z	ic56	Cntryboy	umount /dev/hda1
2006-06-14T10:26:00.000Z	ic56	Cntryboy	umount /dev/hda1
2006-06-14T10:29:00.000Z	ic56	Cntryboy	you have made a big mess.  We can spend hours trying to walk you through how to fix.  If your object is to learn, rather than to get it working, why not read the manuals?  Read the following manpages: mount, umount, fstab
2006-06-14T10:29:00.000Z	ic56	Cntryboy	no, it won't umount them both.
2006-06-14T10:32:00.000Z	ic56	Cntryboy	you have already made a good dozen mistakes in your config from what I can tell.  If you want to learn, read the manual.  If you want it working quickly, run the script.
2006-06-14T10:32:00.000Z	ic56	Cntryboy	your fstab is completely wrong
2006-06-14T10:43:00.000Z	ic56	Cntryboy	you *can* mount two partitions to the same location -- but it doesn't do what you think.
