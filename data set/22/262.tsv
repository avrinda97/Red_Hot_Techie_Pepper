2012-02-13T09:21:00.000Z	ch33z		should i just install a gui?
2012-02-13T09:21:00.000Z	ch33z		im runinng a server
2012-02-13T09:21:00.000Z	ch33z		but running a server with gui is kinda dumb right?
2012-02-13T09:22:00.000Z	Feldegast	ch33z	try mc that's what i like
2012-02-13T09:23:00.000Z	Feldegast	ch33z	mc has a filemanager and editor
2012-02-13T09:28:00.000Z	Feldegast	ch33z	no need for a gui on a server, do all your stuff on another system and copy to the server
2012-02-13T09:35:00.000Z	ch33z	Feldegast	how exactly do i add the files from another server?
2012-02-13T09:35:00.000Z	Feldegast	ch33z	samba
2012-02-13T09:36:00.000Z	ch33z	Feldegast	samba is installed so now what? ;0
2012-02-13T09:36:00.000Z	Feldegast	ch33z	i did this about 10 years ago so i am a little rusty :(
2012-02-13T09:37:00.000Z	ch33z	Feldegast	im just trying to set up a new server with hosting html files and being able to access hard drives plugged in the server
2012-02-13T09:38:00.000Z	Feldegast	ch33z	if you have apache, samba and you can even install ssh for remote access you should be fine, you can install webmin as well if you want a remote gui like config
2012-02-13T09:40:00.000Z	Feldegast	ch33z	as i said, 10 years, try zentyal as sugested, tho i have not used it
2012-02-13T09:45:00.000Z	Feldegast	ch33z	as i said i have not used it
2012-02-13T09:46:00.000Z	Feldegast	ch33z	i was just about to get it to see what it did
