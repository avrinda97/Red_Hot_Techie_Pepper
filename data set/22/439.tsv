2011-10-03T17:17:00.000Z	codefriar		Help! my user crontab isn't running!
2011-10-03T17:17:00.000Z	codefriar		how can I make it work?
2011-10-03T17:17:00.000Z	ikonia	codefriar	why don't you explain your problem
2011-10-03T17:18:00.000Z	codefriar	ikonia	so I have what I believe is a perfectly valid crontab file edited with crontab -e
2011-10-03T17:18:00.000Z	codefriar		however, it's not runniung every hour
2011-10-03T17:18:00.000Z	ikonia	codefriar	can you show me the crontab line ?
2011-10-03T17:18:00.000Z	codefriar		0 0,6,12,18 * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'backup perform -t jiradb'
2011-10-03T17:19:00.000Z	ikonia	codefriar	that's doesn't look very valid
2011-10-03T17:19:00.000Z	ikonia	codefriar	keep in mind I don't know your personal environment
2011-10-03T17:19:00.000Z	codefriar		fairly generic / stock ubuntu install
2011-10-03T17:20:00.000Z	codefriar	ikonia	what doesn't look valid?
2011-10-03T17:21:00.000Z	ikonia	codefriar	why you are launching bash, the command "backup perform" etc etc
2011-10-03T17:22:00.000Z	ikonia	codefriar	keep in mind you may need to use full paths if the default shell enviornment isn't setup to deal with this.
2011-10-03T17:24:00.000Z	codefriar	ikonia	so I should just call backup directly with the full path?
2011-10-03T17:24:00.000Z	ikonia	codefriar	that may be a better option
2011-10-03T17:25:00.000Z	ikonia	codefriar	I'm not familiar with the command "backup" so don't know it's behaviour
2011-10-03T17:25:00.000Z	codefriar		is there a way to test crontabs/
2011-10-03T17:27:00.000Z	codefriar	ikonia	how's this look: 0 0,6,12,18 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup perform -t jiradb
2011-10-03T17:28:00.000Z	ikonia	codefriar	to me, that looks better
2011-10-03T17:28:00.000Z	codefriar	ikonia	is there a way to test?
2011-10-03T17:28:00.000Z	ikonia		run it
2011-10-03T17:29:00.000Z	codefriar	ikonia	how can I run y crontab? and how can I test that it will execute @ the right time?
