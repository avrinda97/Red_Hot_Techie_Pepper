2010-05-01T07:24:00.000Z	Lasivian		my x is screwed up, how do I boot to a shell?
2010-05-01T07:25:00.000Z	acicula	Lasivian	in grub menu select rescue mode, use esc or hold shift to access it on boot
2010-05-01T07:25:00.000Z	Lasivian	acicula	yeah, I can't figure out how to get to the grub menu
2010-05-01T07:25:00.000Z	acicula	Lasivian	hold shift
2010-05-01T07:25:00.000Z	Lasivian	acicula	thanks
2010-05-01T07:30:00.000Z	acicula	Lasivian	fresh 10.04 install?
2010-05-01T07:35:00.000Z	acicula	Lasivian	there isnt one by default
2010-05-01T07:36:00.000Z	Lasivian	acicula	well, the instructions page for the OQO I have in Linux specifies where to add lines to the xorg
2010-05-01T07:36:00.000Z	acicula	Lasivian	OQO?
2010-05-01T07:37:00.000Z	Lasivian	acicula	it's a little computer device, it's got a 800x480 res that X can't display
2010-05-01T07:38:00.000Z	Lasivian	acicula	I found a fix here, but I can't figure out how to implement it: http://billigites.blogspot.com/2007/08/ubuntu-linux-on-oqo-o2.html
2010-05-01T07:39:00.000Z	acicula	Lasivian	have a read there , think it describes how to add modelines and such
2010-05-01T07:39:00.000Z	acicula	Lasivian	you may just have to create the xorg.conf file to get it work
2010-05-01T07:41:00.000Z	acicula	Lasivian	well device hacking is never easy ;)
2010-05-01T09:01:00.000Z	acicula	Lasivian	ctrl-alt-enter? +-(numpad) used to work
2010-05-01T09:01:00.000Z	acicula	Lasivian	very long ago it did anyway, but you can probably enable it still
2010-05-01T09:03:00.000Z	Lasivian	acicula	argh, I can't hit all those at the same time on this damn thing
2010-05-01T09:03:00.000Z	acicula	Lasivian	hehe
2010-05-01T09:04:00.000Z	Lasivian	acicula	I found this: http://www.mail-archive.com/ubuntu-bugs@lists.ubuntu.com/msg803077.html but it's not working
2010-05-01T09:04:00.000Z	acicula	Lasivian	it may just be ctrl-alt +-(numpad)
2010-05-01T09:05:00.000Z	acicula	Lasivian	but best google for it, as it probably needs to be enabled explicitly to work
2010-05-01T09:06:00.000Z	Lasivian	acicula	I have been, for the last 6 hours.. and it's not making any sense, it would seenm I should be able to force a 640x480 at least
