2012-04-09T20:38:00.000Z	wbullock8		I changed the IP address on my server and now apt-get update won't connnect, the moment I change it back to the old IP everything works fine... any help would be greatly appreciated
2012-04-09T20:40:00.000Z	wbullock8		does anyone know why apt-get won't connect after just changing the IP address of the server?
2012-04-09T20:41:00.000Z	wbullock8		no it's setup at work
2012-04-09T20:41:00.000Z	wbullock8		I'm running ubuntu server 11.10 on it
2012-04-09T20:41:00.000Z	wbullock8		physical
2012-04-09T20:42:00.000Z	wbullock8		all i did was edit the interfaces file and change the IP address and now apt-get update fails to connect every time
2012-04-09T20:43:00.000Z	wbullock8		yes I went from .45 to a .26
2012-04-09T20:43:00.000Z	wbullock8		on a 10.x.x.x network
2012-04-09T20:44:00.000Z	wbullock8		no as a matter of fact everybody can see the server just fine and I can also initiate connections out... but for some reason apt-get wont work
2012-04-09T20:44:00.000Z	wbullock8		if i change the IP back to what it was everything works fine
2012-04-09T20:45:00.000Z	ssta	wbullock8	do you have an apt-proxy set or something maybe?
2012-04-09T20:48:00.000Z	ssta	wbullock8	paste the contents of /etc/apt/apt.conf  ?
2012-04-09T20:50:00.000Z	wbullock8	ssta	I don't have that file but rather a directory for configuration
2012-04-09T20:50:00.000Z	ssta	wbullock8	hmm, okay.  can you ping us.archive.ubuntu.com?
2012-04-09T20:53:00.000Z	ssta	wbullock8	wget http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/project/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg
2012-04-09T20:58:00.000Z	ssta	wbullock8	pastebin the output of "route -n"?
2012-04-09T20:58:00.000Z	ssta	wbullock8	may as well do /etc/network/interfaces while you're there
2012-04-09T20:59:00.000Z	ssta	wbullock8	pastebin
2012-04-09T21:02:00.000Z	ssta	wbullock8	are you sure that the router is set to allow that IP out?
2012-04-09T21:03:00.000Z	ssta	wbullock8	do you have /etc/network/interfaces both the working and non-working version?
2012-04-09T21:05:00.000Z	ssta	wbullock8	all I can think of is that it's your router blocking it.  Sorry
2012-04-09T21:06:00.000Z	ssta	wbullock8	not necessarily.  Depends how it's setup.  ICMP is different to TCP.  It might be allowing ICMP out but not TCP
