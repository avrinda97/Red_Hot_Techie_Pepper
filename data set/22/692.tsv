2011-05-06T11:29:00.000Z	Reign_		I do not know how to install Xine. Instructions I have found don't make sense.
2011-05-06T11:31:00.000Z	Reign_		brb
2011-05-06T11:31:00.000Z	jbicha	Reign_	why can't you just use pulseaudio?
2011-05-06T11:42:00.000Z	jbicha	Reign_	xine isn't supported in Ubuntu these days as much as pulseaudio is
2011-05-06T11:43:00.000Z	Reign_	jbicha	the websites I read didn't say that. So how do I play movies?
2011-05-06T11:44:00.000Z	jbicha	Reign_	oh I'm sorry, xine is just a media player
2011-05-06T11:44:00.000Z	Reign_	jbicha	the websites didn't say that either. My movie player, which I think is Totem, doesn't work.
2011-05-06T11:44:00.000Z	jbicha	Reign_	try VLC
2011-05-06T11:45:00.000Z	Reign_	jbicha	would that site include instructions in a form of English a non techie would understand?
2011-05-06T11:45:00.000Z	jbicha	Reign_	install VLC from the Ubuntu Software Center
2011-05-06T11:45:00.000Z	Reign_	jbicha	all right, I'll check. But I could find no movie player there.
2011-05-06T11:46:00.000Z	jbicha	Reign_	but what type of video are you specifically trying to play?
2011-05-06T11:46:00.000Z	Reign_	jbicha	DVD movie. Came from Netflix. VLC available but says nothing about DVDs
2011-05-06T11:47:00.000Z	jbicha	Reign_	you can also open the Help app and search for DVD and it will give you the same instructions but maybe easier
2011-05-06T11:48:00.000Z	jbicha	Reign_	and then even Movie Player should support DVDs but I use VLC, I've not used xine in a long long time
2011-05-06T11:48:00.000Z	Reign_	jbicha	back to instruction problems. It tells me to do things but not how
2011-05-06T11:50:00.000Z	jbicha	Reign_	"How do I enable restricted codecs to play DVDs" in Help walks you through the steps you need
2011-05-06T11:51:00.000Z	jbicha	Reign_	have you found Ubuntu Software Center yet?
2011-05-06T11:53:00.000Z	jbicha	Reign_	Have you found the Help app?
2011-05-06T11:53:00.000Z	Reign_	jbicha	Help app??
2011-05-06T11:53:00.000Z	jbicha	Reign_	click the Ubuntu button in the top left and search for Help
2011-05-06T11:54:00.000Z	jbicha	Reign_	search for Help and then once Help starts search for the DVD codecs article
