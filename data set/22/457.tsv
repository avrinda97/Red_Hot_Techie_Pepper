2011-09-19T02:07:00.000Z	Insadesu		hello I need help.
2011-09-19T02:08:00.000Z	Insadesu		when i close my laptop lid, and i open it. the screen lock appears and i input my password to log in again.
2011-09-19T02:08:00.000Z	Insadesu		to unloack, basically.
2011-09-19T02:08:00.000Z	Insadesu		I'm running Ubuntu 10.10
2011-09-19T02:08:00.000Z	Insadesu		When my mother opens the laptop lid (when im on school) she is unable to switch users..
2011-09-19T02:09:00.000Z	Insadesu		when I clicked on Switch User, it showed a black screen. and if i moved the mouse.. it took me back to the screen lock.
2011-09-19T02:09:00.000Z	Insadesu		how do i make so it takes her to the user selection?
2011-09-19T02:10:00.000Z	Insadesu		Hello?
2011-09-19T02:11:00.000Z	th0r	Insadesu	there should be an option where you set up the computer to suspend on lid closure...something about lock computer on resume
2011-09-19T02:11:00.000Z	Insadesu	th0r	ubuntu tweak can do it, i think.
2011-09-19T02:12:00.000Z	th0r	Insadesu	I don't use gnome, in xfce it is in the xfce power manager under Extended - "lock screen when....."
2011-09-19T02:13:00.000Z	Insadesu	th0r	oh, here it is.
2011-09-19T02:14:00.000Z	th0r	Insadesu	if you disable those, it won't take you mom to the login screen, it will resume from whereever you left off
2011-09-19T02:17:00.000Z	Insadesu	th0r	i need someone with gnome...
2011-09-19T02:17:00.000Z	Insadesu	th0r	although i believe you have knowledge of gnome, right?
2011-09-19T02:17:00.000Z	th0r	Insadesu	nope....never liked it
2011-09-19T02:18:00.000Z	Insadesu	th0r	I see..
2011-09-19T02:18:00.000Z	Insadesu	th0r	says here: disable 'fast user switching' [ ]
2011-09-19T02:19:00.000Z	Insadesu	th0r	i just don't get it. why won't none of the buttons work? except for 'unlock'.
2011-09-19T02:19:00.000Z	th0r	Insadesu	if you have an Unlock button then the rest require sudo access....which you get by 'Unlocking'
2011-09-19T02:20:00.000Z	Insadesu	th0r	So how do I make it so the other buttons do not need 'sudo'? because on 11.04 this never happened. the buttons didn't need it.
2011-09-19T02:21:00.000Z	th0r	Insadesu	you are really asking the wrong person about gnome
