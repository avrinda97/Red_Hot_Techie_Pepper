2007-10-30T10:23:00.000Z	maniaxmax		How do I get the 2 screensavers set up shown in this video? http://youtube.com/watch?v=Rmz9a9pJR_s
2007-10-30T10:24:00.000Z	Jimdb	maniaxmax	the screensavers are part of compizfusion...should be in there alerady.  you need to go into the config manager for compiz and check the box for screen savers.
2007-10-30T10:27:00.000Z	maniaxmax	Jimdb	Screensavers is not in my configuration for compiz, am I missing something?
2007-10-30T10:29:00.000Z	Jimdb	maniaxmax	you need to install the advanced settings manager to see all the options.  they are there, you just have the basic settings manager installed.
2007-10-30T10:29:00.000Z	maniaxmax	Jimdb	how do I go about doing this, Im new to linux...
2007-10-30T10:30:00.000Z	maniaxmax	Jimdb	well actually my settings manager is called "Advanced desktop effect settings"
2007-10-30T10:31:00.000Z	Jimdb	maniaxmax	then look to see if you have the compiz extras
2007-10-30T10:32:00.000Z	Jimdb	maniaxmax	in synaptic search for compiz.  in there you should see a bunch of plugins.  one of them is plugins-main.  another is plugins-extras.  another is plugins-unofficial, etc, etc etc.
2007-10-30T10:33:00.000Z	maniaxmax	Jimdb	ok and what all do i need?
2007-10-30T10:33:00.000Z	Jimdb		from what I can tell it is from plugin-extras.  you'll just have to experiment till you get the plugin package that has the screensavers.
2007-10-30T10:34:00.000Z	Jimdb		maniamax: do you know what synaptic is?
2007-10-30T10:35:00.000Z	maniaxmax	Jimdb	I have Compiz plugins, Compiz Fuzion Plugins Main, and Compiz Fuzion plugins Extra all installed already :(
2007-10-30T10:36:00.000Z	Jimdb		maniamax:  if you type ccsm in a terminal window does it bring up the control panel for compiz and have a long list to scroll through?
2007-10-30T10:37:00.000Z	Jimdb		he's spamming us
2007-10-30T10:38:00.000Z	maniaxmax	Jimdb	Yes thats what comes up, but I see no option for screensavers... :(
2007-10-30T10:38:00.000Z	Jimdb	maniaxmax	 you should ensure you have the unsupported plugins too.
2007-10-30T10:38:00.000Z	maniaxmax	Jimdb	I didnt see them in Synaptic, how do I go about getting them?
2007-10-30T10:38:00.000Z	Jimdb	maniaxmax	 i can't say why then.  only thing is that it should be a plug in from one of those packages.  if it isn't there I can't tell you why it is missing.
2007-10-30T10:39:00.000Z	maniaxmax	Jimdb	Yeah I didnt have any "unsupported plugins" where would I go to download them?
2007-10-30T10:40:00.000Z	Jimdb	maniaxmax	 all of htem are part of the ubuntu repositories.  you just need to enable the extra repositories provided by ubuntu.  I would do it in the /etc/apt/sources.list file but i don't have the time to explain to you how to edit that file to enable those.  you could try yourself and maybe someone else can assist you further.
2007-10-30T10:42:00.000Z	maniaxmax	Jimdb	Ok, I will see what I can do, Thank you very much for your help, I appreciate it
