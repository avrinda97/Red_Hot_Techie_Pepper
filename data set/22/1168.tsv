2010-09-06T21:26:00.000Z	zak23e3i		The program 'glxinfo' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
2010-09-06T21:26:00.000Z	zak23e3i		apt-get install mesa-utils
2010-09-06T21:26:00.000Z	soreau	zak23e3i	It is telling you that you have to install mesa-utils package to use glxinfo..

2010-09-06T21:32:00.000Z	zak23e3i	soreau	OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI R300 (RS400 5A62) 20090101 x86/MMX/SSE2 NO-TCL DRI2
2010-09-06T21:32:00.000Z	soreau	zak23e3i	Ok, step 2. What is wrong with google earth and games?
2010-09-06T21:34:00.000Z	zak23e3i	soreau	when i zoom in Earth it becomes very badly, appear many strips and kinda no need lines... the same with mini games
2010-09-06T21:35:00.000Z	soreau	zak23e3i	You likely need newer radeon driver then. You can get it by installing a more recent kernel (latest is 2.6.35) and installing xorg-edgers repo to update the userspace components
2010-09-06T21:36:00.000Z	soreau	zak23e3i	Because I suspect you are still using 2.6.32 and there have been a considerable amount of changes in the radeon driver since then
2010-09-06T21:37:00.000Z	zak23e3i	soreau	how to compile kernel?
2010-09-06T21:38:00.000Z	soreau	zak23e3i	You dont need to compile anything. There are deb packages you can install
2010-09-06T21:39:00.000Z	zak23e3i	soreau	ok ty :)
