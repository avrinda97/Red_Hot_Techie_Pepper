2006-06-12T05:38:00.000Z	eobanb	siriusnova	how about the dapper live CD
2006-06-12T05:38:00.000Z	siriusnova	eobanb	- i dont think it has gparted
2006-07-04T11:27:00.000Z	eobanb	siriusnova	cheeseman557, chariscomp, what are your questions
2006-07-04T11:29:00.000Z	eobanb	siriusnova	what wireless chipset
2006-07-04T11:30:00.000Z	siriusnova	eobanb	- it's a SMC 2336W-AG so it uses the atheros chipset
2006-07-04T11:30:00.000Z	eobanb	siriusnova	i would think that the old drivers would not support WPA, and i guess since the new ones do, then you'll have to switch between them.
2006-07-04T11:31:00.000Z	siriusnova	eobanb	- how do i recompile the new ones in ubuntu, if i use madwifi-ng straight from the madwifi website WPA doesnt work either
2006-07-04T11:32:00.000Z	eobanb	siriusnova	are you sure the card itself can do WPA?
2006-07-04T11:34:00.000Z	siriusnova	eobanb	- that is for restricted codecs, im looking for the source that Ubuntu Dapper uses for madwifi
2006-07-04T11:34:00.000Z	eobanb	siriusnova	i am trying to help jesse_ as well
2006-07-04T11:37:00.000Z	siriusnova	eobanb	- my problem is that the madwifi-ng drivers straight from madwifi-ng dont work with Network-Manager and WPA and neither does madwiif-old so basically im screwed :(
2006-07-04T11:38:00.000Z	eobanb	siriusnova	i'm sorry, i don't know what to tell you.  packet injection is not something most users need.
