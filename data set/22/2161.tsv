2010-02-08T12:00:00.000Z	m0ar		How to move a program that's run in terminal, as in gnome-panel, to the background?
2010-02-08T12:01:00.000Z	m0ar		Just shove it away from my sight
2010-02-08T12:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	m0ar	"gnome-panel & exit" worked on my system...
2010-02-08T12:03:00.000Z	m0ar	ZykoticK9	That closes my terminal for me :P
2010-02-08T12:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	m0ar	but it should start gnome-panel first then exit...
2010-02-08T12:05:00.000Z	m0ar	ZykoticK9	& = at the same time   && = afterwards
2010-02-08T12:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	m0ar	i never suggested && ???
2010-02-08T12:06:00.000Z	m0ar	ZykoticK9	I just clearified, since you made a false statement :)  & doesn't do anything afterwards
2010-02-08T12:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	m0ar	fair enough
2010-02-08T12:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	m0ar	if you want to get "technical" the && mean after the first command successfully runs, run the next command
2010-02-08T12:08:00.000Z	m0ar	ZykoticK9	If you want to get techical, yes

2010-03-03T05:31:00.000Z	m0ar	ZykoticK9	Nice!  Tho, how can i make sure i get into gnome when i log in?
2010-03-03T05:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	m0ar	i though you wanted to NOT get into Gnome?  if you disable GDM you can start X by running "startx"
2010-03-03T05:33:00.000Z	m0ar	ZykoticK9	When I boot i want to get to a console login. When I login as my user, I want to get into gnome. Get me? :)
2010-03-03T05:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	m0ar	ya startx is what you want - if Gnome doesn't start by default you may need to create/edit a .xinitrc file in your home dir
2010-03-03T05:35:00.000Z	m0ar	ZykoticK9	I create the file ".xinitrc" in ~, and remove GDM? Simple as that?
2010-03-03T05:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	m0ar	just stop GDM from starting and see if everything is already working the way you want -- IF not, then you might need to read/research about the .xinitrc file -- i think you'd just need "exec gnome-session" in the file, but it's been a long time since i used one - so be sure to verify on the net first
2010-03-03T05:37:00.000Z	m0ar	ZykoticK9	Thanks!
2010-03-07T07:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	m0ar	you can use the command gdmflexiserver to start another xorg session, BUT you need 2 user names (it won't let you log in as same user twice)
2010-03-07T07:19:00.000Z	m0ar	ZykoticK9	D'aww :c
