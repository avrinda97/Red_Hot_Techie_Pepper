2005-04-13T05:38:00.000Z	archangel_		gentoo drove me crazy with commands.  I'm a newbie and I couldn't get anything to start
2005-04-13T05:38:00.000Z	archangel_		thats when I went to windows got some viruses and came back to the light
2005-04-13T05:38:00.000Z	archangel_		I love portage
2005-04-13T05:39:00.000Z	archangel_		lol
2005-04-13T05:39:00.000Z	archangel_		I cheaped out and did stage 3 and had it detect my stuff
2005-04-13T05:40:00.000Z	archangel_		did anyone install it by the handbook?
2005-04-13T05:40:00.000Z	archangel_		I spent hours reading word for word
2005-04-13T05:40:00.000Z	archangel_		that was insane
2005-04-13T05:40:00.000Z	archangel_		lol
2005-04-13T05:40:00.000Z	archangel_		me too
2005-04-13T05:40:00.000Z	roo_	archangel_	i think the handbooks are EXCELLENT.
2005-04-13T05:41:00.000Z	roo_	archangel_	they already do: Gentoo Forums :)
2005-04-13T05:42:00.000Z	archangel_	roo_	got to say though when you choose gentoo and you go in their irc you better not be a newbie or they'll drop you
2005-04-13T05:42:00.000Z	roo_	archangel_	yep, altho the forums are great. if only as a reference, very rare that you are the first to have a problem.
2005-04-13T05:43:00.000Z	archangel_	roo_	very true.  I didn't discover forums until the hoary install when my friend cut off my tech support so he and his girlfriend could grind
2005-04-13T05:53:00.000Z	roo_	archangel_	fvwm is a polar opposite of bloat!
2005-04-13T05:53:00.000Z	roo_	archangel_	its tiny, with tiny dependencies.
2005-04-13T05:53:00.000Z	roo_	archangel_	very small. WAY smaller than gnome and kde for certain.
2005-04-13T05:56:00.000Z	roo_	archangel_	well, patience and hard work. but its worth it.
2005-04-13T05:56:00.000Z	archangel_	roo_	does synaptic have it
2005-04-13T05:56:00.000Z	roo_	archangel_	of course ;)
2005-04-13T05:58:00.000Z	roo_	archangel_	just remove all the gnome stuf. thats what i did.
