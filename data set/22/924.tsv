2011-01-29T09:16:00.000Z	jimblah		Anyone ever use Orbiter 2010 and would like to bring it to linux?
2011-01-29T09:18:00.000Z	madsailor	jimblah	you can try running it under wine
2011-01-29T09:19:00.000Z	jimblah	madsailor	its not the same, I've tried with multiple versions of wine, I've followed there directions at their forum. 5 fps is a no go
2011-01-29T09:20:00.000Z	jimblah		Then they insult linux asa crappy os and ubuntu as a distro, not in their forum but in their irc
2011-01-29T09:21:00.000Z	madsailor	jimblah	yeah, 5 fps is rough.  Only options are to run win in a vm, or talk to the orbiter devs and get them to make a linux port
2011-01-29T09:22:00.000Z	jimblah		Its worth bring to linux and mac, but the creator is too busy in medical research
2011-01-29T09:22:00.000Z	jimblah		the addon developers are rude
2011-01-29T09:23:00.000Z	jimblah		I hate dual booting, I live in ubuntu
2011-01-29T09:23:00.000Z	madsailor	jimblah	like I said, if you own a copy of a win version that orbiter will run on you can run it in a vm
2011-01-29T09:23:00.000Z	jimblah		with 3d acceleration?
2011-01-29T09:24:00.000Z	madsailor	jimblah	, worth a try
2011-01-29T09:24:00.000Z	jimblah		Its a space sim
2011-01-29T09:25:00.000Z	jimblah		much better than celestia
2011-01-29T09:25:00.000Z	jimblah		the addon developers even rip off the motherlode and put there meshes and textures in there stuff
2011-01-29T09:26:00.000Z	jimblah		I found it looking for a way to build models for compiz 3dcubemodel
2011-01-29T09:28:00.000Z	jimblah		Where would I go to drum up support to clone, find other developers, for a clone for *nix
2011-01-29T09:30:00.000Z	jimblah		Orbitux
2011-01-29T09:30:00.000Z	jimblah		Tux Orbiter
2011-01-29T09:31:00.000Z	jimblah		anyother ideas before I go?
2011-01-29T09:31:00.000Z	jimblah		or stop mentioning it
2011-01-29T09:32:00.000Z	jimblah		sure
2011-01-29T09:33:00.000Z	madsailor	jimblah	make a vat of coffee, mix it with a sixpack of redbull lock the door and start reverse-engineering
