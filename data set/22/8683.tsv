2009-05-24T03:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	mman	the us mirror no longer has gutsy packages becouse gutsy is discontinued as already have been pointed out to you
2011-02-19T22:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	mman	if you got to initramfs the something happened. do you get any error message?
2011-02-19T22:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	mman	like, no root found,. or give up waiting for root or something like that ( no init found )
2011-02-19T22:26:00.000Z	mman	erUSUL	im on a laptop and had some energy problems and then got the initramfs
2011-02-19T22:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	mman	sometimes doing "exit" in the initramfs can continue the boot process but usually there is some underlying issue
2011-02-19T22:27:00.000Z	mman	erUSUL	the last msg that it gives me is: attached SCSI removable disk
2011-02-19T22:28:00.000Z	mman	erUSUL	i typed exit but nothing happened, it just hold there
2011-02-19T22:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	mman	then something else is wrong. reboot and look for the error that drops you to the initramfs
2011-02-19T22:30:00.000Z	mman	erUSUL	it is too fast, cant read what is the problem, how can i read it?
2011-02-19T22:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	mman	i would edit grub menu to remove splash and quiet from kernel line
2011-02-19T22:31:00.000Z	mman	erUSUL	just typed exit and got the following: cant open /root/dev/console : no such file
2011-02-19T22:33:00.000Z	mman	erUSUL	how would i do that?
2011-02-19T22:33:00.000Z	mman	erUSUL	with a live cd?
2011-02-19T22:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	mman	when booting in the grub menu press "e" to edit the menu entry
2011-02-19T22:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	mman	remove splash and quiet from the kernel line and do "ctl +x " to boot the modified entry?
2011-02-19T22:35:00.000Z	mman	erUSUL	now..?
2011-02-19T22:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	mman	crtl + x to boot the modified entry
2011-02-19T22:35:00.000Z	mman	erUSUL	just did it and again i land in the same place
2011-02-19T22:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	mman	you should be able to see more info
2011-02-19T22:36:00.000Z	mman	erUSUL	yes, but it gets too fast and get to the same point
2011-02-20T01:30:00.000Z	mman	erUSUL	i did what you said, but still get the same in initramfs
