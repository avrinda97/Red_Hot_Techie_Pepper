2010-05-08T00:54:00.000Z	roberto_	ActionParsnip	hey, that didn't work but it had interesting results
2010-05-08T00:55:00.000Z	roberto_	ActionParsnip	when I added 127.0.0.1 to the front of that list, it was the only server that would appear in resolv.conf .. the others would go away. and no dns access obviously
2010-05-08T00:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roberto_	also add 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
2010-05-08T00:56:00.000Z	roberto_	ActionParsnip	well google DNS and openDNS are basically the same thing .. I'm not worried aobut which servers it talks to, just so ong as it talks somewhere :)
2010-05-08T00:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roberto_	sure, thats why you add multiple servers, seperated by commas in the dns list in network manager
2010-05-08T00:57:00.000Z	roberto_	ActionParsnip	I mean taht, you can add as many as you like in the network config manager, but it only will write 3 of them to resolv.conf so ... might as well save myself the trouble of typing
2010-05-08T00:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roberto_	sure, thats why mine is how it is
2010-05-08T00:58:00.000Z	roberto_	ActionParsnip	I'll split the difference with you: 127.0.0.1, 208.67.222.222, 8.8.8.8
2010-05-08T00:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roberto_	sure
2010-05-08T00:58:00.000Z	roberto_	ActionParsnip	I'm going to try taht .. brb
2010-05-08T01:03:00.000Z	roberto_	ActionParsnip	no, any time that list of dns servers for network connection has 127.0.0.1 at the start of the list, the resolv.conf never get's the remaining servers in the list
2010-05-08T01:03:00.000Z	roberto_	ActionParsnip	maybe it's soemthing that's changed with 10.04
2010-05-08T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roberto_	i use 10.04
2010-05-08T01:04:00.000Z	roberto_	ActionParsnip	well geez, I don't know. You mean System->Preferences->Network connections ?
2010-05-08T01:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roberto_	no, i use network-manager
2010-05-08T01:05:00.000Z	roberto_	ActionParsnip	aha! where is that?
2010-05-08T01:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roberto_	in the notification area,  nm-applet
2010-05-08T01:07:00.000Z	roberto_	ActionParsnip	what? you mean the little visual notification thing at the top-right corner ?
2010-05-08T01:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roberto_	sure
2010-05-08T01:07:00.000Z	roberto_	ActionParsnip	sorry, I just don't know
2010-05-08T01:09:00.000Z	roberto_	ActionParsnip	that .. my network icon doesn't have any way to edit the configuration for the connections there. On my copy of Lucid, you have to use the System->Preferences->Network Connections manager to configure those
2010-05-09T22:36:00.000Z	roberto_	ActionParsnip	danke
