2007-02-17T10:14:00.000Z	bruenig	patrialt	oh I think the issue might be that this doesn't use uuid
2007-02-17T10:18:00.000Z	patrialt	bruenig	what you use a seperate partition for storage what format do you use?
2007-02-17T10:18:00.000Z	bruenig	patrialt	ext3
2007-02-17T10:18:00.000Z	bruenig	patrialt	you don't have to change the /home directory to just make a separate storage partition
