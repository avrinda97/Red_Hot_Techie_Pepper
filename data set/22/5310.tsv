2007-05-28T06:20:00.000Z	kitche		I should really start working on my QT database program or learn how to meta program
2007-05-28T06:21:00.000Z	lockd	kitche	a database frontend in QT?
2007-05-28T06:21:00.000Z	kitche	lockd	yeah just for something to do lol
2007-05-28T10:38:00.000Z	kitche	lockd	edit /etc/lilo.conf then just run lilo
2007-05-28T10:48:00.000Z	kitche	lockd	umm not really since that is just a Warning and not an error
2007-06-04T15:54:00.000Z	kitche	lockd	actually each user can have a cron job if they wanted to
2007-06-04T15:54:00.000Z	lockd	kitche	they just have to have the right permissions?
2007-06-04T15:55:00.000Z	kitche	lockd	pretty much liek you can sync sources as a user instead as root if you wanted
2007-06-04T15:55:00.000Z	kitche	lockd	if the sources is ina spot that user can write to
2007-06-07T16:26:00.000Z	lockd	kitche	what do you mean splits all the files up?
2007-06-07T16:26:00.000Z	kitche	lockd	the configs are in many files instead of one for some programs
2007-06-07T16:27:00.000Z	lockd	kitche	yes, but programs handle the configuration files
2007-06-07T16:27:00.000Z	lockd	kitche	Ubuntu has little to do with that
2007-06-07T16:28:00.000Z	lockd	kitche	it isn't like in Windows, where there is one huge Registry with most programs' configuration
2007-06-07T16:28:00.000Z	kitche	lockd	well I can install the same program on a different distro and it has one config file
2007-06-07T16:29:00.000Z	lockd	kitche	well, I guess I don't know.  most services get their own directory to keep them together
2007-12-30T05:28:00.000Z	kitche	lockd	it's not the same as a jail
2007-12-30T05:28:00.000Z	lockd	kitche	so in BSD you don't have to forward the /dev and all that/
2007-12-30T05:29:00.000Z	kitche	lockd	you can mount /dev and other things inside the jail
2007-12-30T05:29:00.000Z	lockd	kitche	or "bind"
2007-12-30T05:30:00.000Z	kitche	lockd	but a jail is really a whole another system why a chroot is a "half" system since it doesn't have it's own ip address
2007-12-30T05:30:00.000Z	kitche	lockd	among some other things
