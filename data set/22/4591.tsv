2008-03-23T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	nathan42100	many people, all hanging out in #ubuntu+1
2008-03-23T21:07:00.000Z	ikonia	nathan42100	that is nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-03-23T21:07:00.000Z	nathan42100	ikonia	yes it does
2008-03-23T21:07:00.000Z	ikonia	nathan42100	no it doesn't, this is a support channel only
2008-03-23T21:08:00.000Z	ikonia	nathan42100	type "/topic"
2008-04-29T23:39:00.000Z	ikonia	nathan42100	just list the problem you want fixing - not the whole story
2008-04-29T23:42:00.000Z	nathan42100	ikonia	I can't mount a partition the way I used to like in 7.10 with the mount options in properties. now it doesn't mount the same way and I can't change it because the mount options tab in properties has disappeared. anyone know where it went?
2008-04-29T23:42:00.000Z	ikonia	nathan42100	ask the channel, people will help when they can, rather than ask a random individual
2008-04-29T23:43:00.000Z	nathan42100	ikonia	i tried, no one even said no, I can't help you. No one replied
2008-04-29T23:43:00.000Z	ikonia	nathan42100	people will reply if they can help, they won't tell you they can't help
2008-04-29T23:47:00.000Z	ikonia	nathan42100	your attitude is not helping people respond
2008-04-30T00:34:00.000Z	ikonia	nathan42100	PLEASE watch your lagnauge
2008-04-30T00:34:00.000Z	ikonia	nathan42100	as I told you your attitude does not make people want to help you quickly
2011-03-26T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	nathan42100	uck ?
2011-03-26T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	nathan42100	that's nothing to do with Ubuntu
2011-03-26T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	nathan42100	there is a support forum and mailing list on that page for that product
2011-03-26T18:25:00.000Z	nathan42100	ikonia	the issue exists when installing stuff via chroot
2011-03-26T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	nathan42100	they have support researches
2011-03-26T18:26:00.000Z	nathan42100	ikonia	can we treat this as if I was just having issues installing that package?
