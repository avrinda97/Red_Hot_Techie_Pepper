2011-08-07T20:08:00.000Z	edbian	escott	I've never used that.
2011-08-07T20:08:00.000Z	escott	edbian	you might suggest his trying nmcli
2011-08-07T23:17:00.000Z	escott	edbian	that would be impressive given the encryption of ssh
2011-08-07T23:18:00.000Z	edbian	escott	good point :)
2011-08-10T04:41:00.000Z	edbian	escott	He can't even boot the liveUSB what makes you think it's the radeon module?
2011-08-10T04:44:00.000Z	escott	edbian	it was ActionParsnip's idea from a few hours ago (and he has often proved himself correct) this is a radeon + core-i-series without disable-able discrete or integrated video (hp doesn't do that) so when the kernel goes to modeset things could get dicey, and the WUBI is failing after dumping a stack trace of something related to radeon evergreen with the string RIP in it.
2011-08-10T04:45:00.000Z	edbian	escott	Ahh, didn't see the wubi dump yet
2011-08-10T04:46:00.000Z	edbian	escott	Yes ActionParsnip is a smart guy :)
2011-08-10T04:56:00.000Z	edbian	escott	NOT supposed to be easy?
2011-08-10T04:56:00.000Z	escott	edbian	ooops thanks... noneabove1182 IS supposed to be easy is NOT supposed to be hard
2011-08-10T04:59:00.000Z	edbian	escott	He can't do that without booting a liveUSB which he can't do noneabove1182
2011-08-10T05:00:00.000Z	escott	edbian	maybe
2011-08-10T05:01:00.000Z	edbian	escott	indeed, maybe
2011-08-17T19:03:00.000Z	escott	edbian	Polah just tested sh foo.sh (containing #!/bin/bash\necho $BASH_VERSION) and it appears to have been executed by dash not bash
2011-08-17T19:04:00.000Z	edbian	escott	Interesting...
2011-08-19T19:57:00.000Z	edbian	escott	alert laundry ?
2011-08-19T19:57:00.000Z	escott	edbian	his original question was about the laundry. alert integrates to the desktop notifications and prints "laundry"
2011-08-19T19:57:00.000Z	edbian	escott	mhmmm
2011-12-18T03:47:00.000Z	escott	edbian	yes
