2005-07-21T12:49:00.000Z	tobytwirl		Hi all! Having a bit of a crisis here and would be grateful for some help.  How can I log on as su ?
2005-07-21T12:50:00.000Z	tobytwirl		There's the problem ... I only have one password and it says it's wrong
2005-07-21T12:51:00.000Z	tobytwirl		Yes but I was only ever asked to supply a password once during installation and I have that written down
2005-07-21T12:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	that password should work with sudo
2005-07-21T12:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	to test, try 'sudo ls' and enter your user password
2005-07-21T12:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	then sudo is working
2005-07-21T13:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	you cannot login as root, by default
2005-07-21T13:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	we recommend using sudo instead
2005-07-21T13:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	you can read that url for more info
2005-07-21T13:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	but 'sudo ls' worked earlier?
2005-07-21T13:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	that's a file list (or so i assme)
2005-07-21T13:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	what error message do you get when using sudo ?
2005-07-21T13:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	fair enough
2005-07-21T13:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	here's maybe a better test: try 'ls -l /home' and then 'sudo ls -l /home'   -- if it works, you should see exactly the same output
2005-07-21T13:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	yay
2005-07-21T13:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	and with sudo it did the same thing?
2005-07-21T13:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	it won't be in colour this time -- that doesn't matter
2005-07-21T13:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	ok. that means that sudo works. Whenever you are asked for a password, enter your user password
2005-07-21T13:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	i was making absolutely certain that sudo works -- i.e., that you can become 'super-user'
2005-07-21T13:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	what are you trying to achieve
2005-07-21T13:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	what device?
2005-07-21T13:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	tobytwirl	you can use 'sudo fdisk -l' to find all your partitions -- don't paste the output here
