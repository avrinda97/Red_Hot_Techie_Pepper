2005-10-23T07:42:00.000Z	PatrikJohansson		how do i install flashplayer(firefox) on my x64 breezy??
2005-10-23T07:43:00.000Z	PatrikJohansson		cant seem to get it working
2005-10-23T07:43:00.000Z	windex	PatrikJohansson	macromedia has not produced 64 bit versions of flash player yet, for any platform
2005-10-23T07:44:00.000Z	PatrikJohansson	windex	but it works in 64 bit win, but i guess thats differnet
2005-10-23T07:44:00.000Z	windex	PatrikJohansson	it can work in 64 bit linux too but you have to install a 32bit chrooted enviroment and 32bit firefox. :)
2005-10-23T07:44:00.000Z	PatrikJohansson	windex	hmm what a pickle
2005-10-23T07:45:00.000Z	windex	PatrikJohansson	well, you did switch cpu architectures.
2005-10-23T07:45:00.000Z	windex	PatrikJohansson	then run x86 ubuntu on it. you won't miss much for workstation use.
2005-10-23T07:45:00.000Z	PatrikJohansson	windex	but it worked np in win, so i thought it wouldnt be a problem :P
2005-10-23T07:45:00.000Z	PatrikJohansson	windex	guess thats an option
2005-10-23T07:46:00.000Z	windex	PatrikJohansson	did you use a pre-built copy of firefox on windows for x86 or x86-64?
2005-10-23T07:47:00.000Z	PatrikJohansson	windex	hmm not sure but i just downloaded it from getfirefox,com, (the version that they recommended)
2005-10-23T07:47:00.000Z	windex	PatrikJohansson	k, it was probably 32bit firefox, which is why 32bit flash worked for you.
2005-10-23T07:47:00.000Z	PatrikJohansson	windex	yeah i guess so
2005-10-23T07:48:00.000Z	windex	PatrikJohansson	the diffrence is windows as an architecture does not require all the same steps as linux for multiplatform support.
2005-10-23T07:49:00.000Z	PatrikJohansson	windex	but the only option i have is to go with the x86 ubuntu??
2005-10-23T07:49:00.000Z	windex	PatrikJohansson	no, you can also install a copy of x86 ubuntu on a seperate partition, then mount that partition in x86-64 ubuntu, and chroot and install software on that partition?
2005-10-23T07:50:00.000Z	PatrikJohansson	windex	doesnt sound like something for a beginner :D
2005-10-23T07:50:00.000Z	windex	PatrikJohansson	nope. :)
2005-10-23T07:50:00.000Z	windex	PatrikJohansson	but.. your the one wanting to run concurrent versions of architecutre on one chip. dosen't sound very beginner to me either. :D
2005-10-23T07:51:00.000Z	windex	PatrikJohansson	if x86 is what you want, just install 32 bit ubuntu. :)
2005-10-23T07:51:00.000Z	PatrikJohansson	windex	hehe, but im rather new to linux, and i didnt even think it could be a problem
