2008-02-28T05:22:00.000Z	arrrghhh		so... no ideas?  titlebars disappear, the fix is "metacity --replace"... what's the problem?  how can i permanently fix this?
2008-02-28T05:23:00.000Z	_Oz_	arrrghhh	you running compiz?
2008-02-28T05:23:00.000Z	arrrghhh	_Oz_	NO... i made damn sure that desktop effects are disabled, because that's the issue everyone is having.
2008-02-28T05:24:00.000Z	_Oz_	arrrghhh	try metacity --replace &
2008-02-28T05:24:00.000Z	_Oz_	arrrghhh	next time you boot up, they should still be there
2008-02-28T05:24:00.000Z	arrrghhh	_Oz_	can you tell me what the & does?
2008-02-28T05:24:00.000Z	_Oz_	arrrghhh	makes sure it keeps running when you close the terminal window
2008-02-28T05:24:00.000Z	arrrghhh	_Oz_	after i close the terminal, it persists.  but when i reboot, it doesn't.
2008-02-28T05:25:00.000Z	_Oz_	arrrghhh	I had this problem and running that command plus rebooting seemed to fix it for good, although I had the problem WITH compiz
2008-02-28T05:25:00.000Z	arrrghhh	_Oz_	hrm... ok i'll see what that does.  thanks.
2008-02-28T05:25:00.000Z	_Oz_	arrrghhh	 are you using a theme manager?
2008-02-28T05:26:00.000Z	_Oz_	arrrghhh	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=492008
2008-02-28T05:26:00.000Z	arrrghhh	_Oz_	i don't believe so... nothing that doesn't already come with plain ubuntu.  i was using xfce on this machine, but the configuration files kept getting screwed up and the menubars would get wonky on her.
2008-02-28T05:27:00.000Z	_Oz_	arrrghhh	xcfe is completely removed?
2008-02-28T05:27:00.000Z	_Oz_	arrrghhh	one more thing
2008-02-28T05:27:00.000Z	_Oz_	arrrghhh	type "gnome-panels"
2008-02-28T05:27:00.000Z	arrrghhh	_Oz_	no i need to completely remove xfce still.
2008-02-28T05:27:00.000Z	arrrghhh	_Oz_	what does "gnome-panels" do
2008-02-28T05:28:00.000Z	_Oz_	arrrghhh	let me know if that works
2008-02-28T05:28:00.000Z	arrrghhh	_Oz_	i can't test it now, but i will when my friend gets home.  i'm helping a friend of mine convert to linux.
2008-02-28T05:29:00.000Z	_Oz_	arrrghhh	ok, I'm betting that will work
2008-02-28T05:29:00.000Z	arrrghhh	_Oz_	ok thanks.
