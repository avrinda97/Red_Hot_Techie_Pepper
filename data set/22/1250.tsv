2010-07-31T07:53:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sdfasdfasdfasdf	the gpg passphrase only unlocks the key, the key is the truly important bit, and that needs to be backed up
2010-07-31T07:54:00.000Z	sdfasdfasdfasdf	tensorpudding	ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh so say i format this pc ok. to be able to extract that tar i would have to put that back up of the key into new kgpg and then decrypt the file, if i didnt have this back up file of the key theres no possible human way i cant decrypt the file again?
2010-07-31T07:55:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sdfasdfasdfasdf	without the key, your chances of reading the file again are as good as attacker trying to read your file without your consent
2010-07-31T07:57:00.000Z	sdfasdfasdfasdf	tensorpudding	i'm sorry i just don't get it fully, and trust me i've googled a lot and there isn't good clear information, if kgpg creates this private key lets imagine its a .key file (don't know) why then do i have to learn a pass phrase if i have the key + the .gpg file containing my protected tar.gz?
2010-07-31T07:59:00.000Z	sdfasdfasdfasdf	tensorpudding	and what is that attacker thing you mention, i thought gpg was quite good at hiding files, it means someone can download some sort of crack (?) and read my file easily if this person got access to my .gpg?
2010-07-31T08:02:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sdfasdfasdfasdf	the encryption is there so that if someone stole your .tar.gz file, they couldn't read it
2010-07-31T08:02:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sdfasdfasdfasdf	by attacker i mean someone who wants to read your .tar.gz file without your consent
2010-07-31T08:03:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sdfasdfasdfasdf	there are ways to try and break the encryption, but they are effectively useless for the most part
2010-07-31T08:03:00.000Z	sdfasdfasdfasdf	tensorpudding	you mean steal my .gpg  file encrypted containing my tar.gz right? or kgpg doesnt alter the original tar.gz
2010-07-31T08:03:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sdfasdfasdfasdf	that is what i meant, the tar.gz.gpg file
2010-07-31T08:06:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sdfasdfasdfasdf	so i forgot what your original question was
2010-07-31T08:06:00.000Z	sdfasdfasdfasdf	tensorpudding	not enought words to thank you man, i wish someone wrote this and it got in first google page :D. so to be sure  i fully understood if my hdd broke and i needed to read again this tar.gz i woould have to not only back up in any mediea the tar.gz.gpg file but the .key backup file too and of course remember the pass phrase the .key file is protecting then. Then in my reinstall of ubuntu, i would have to make kgpg re
2010-07-31T08:07:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sdfasdfasdfasdf	the GnuPG page has a ton of information about how gpg works
2010-07-31T08:09:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sdfasdfasdfasdf	If you wanted to back up your gpg key, you can export the key to a file, save the file somewhere on some backup media, then import the key into gpg when necessary
2010-07-31T08:09:00.000Z	sdfasdfasdfasdf	tensorpudding	ok i'll take a look but what i said right before is right?
2010-07-31T08:09:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sdfasdfasdfasdf	if you're afraid of losing the passphrase you can write it down in a file on the backup
2010-07-31T08:10:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sdfasdfasdfasdf	the description of the process you gave is correct
2010-07-31T08:10:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sdfasdfasdfasdf	like cast said, you can back up the key by printing it out
2010-07-31T08:13:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sdfasdfasdfasdf	I think 1024 bits is considered to be safe on the multi-decade scale at current
2010-07-31T08:14:00.000Z	sdfasdfasdfasdf	tensorpudding	wow even with lastest intel processors combined? ok im overreacting here not like if the nasa wanted to read this tar.gz hehe
2010-07-31T08:16:00.000Z	sdfasdfasdfasdf	tensorpudding	wow i'm using 2048 then :D
2010-07-31T08:16:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sdfasdfasdfasdf	the resources to break 1024 would be out of the reach of most everyone
