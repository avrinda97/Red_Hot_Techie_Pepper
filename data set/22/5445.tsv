2008-09-06T22:21:00.000Z	Kira		*sigh*
2008-09-06T22:21:00.000Z	Kira		now I feel kinda stupid.
2008-09-06T22:22:00.000Z	Kira		I should have installed Hardy Server instead of Hardy Desktop.
2008-09-06T22:22:00.000Z	Gnea	Kira	so reinstall
2008-09-06T22:23:00.000Z	Gnea	Kira	so does mine. i've got a nice 1.5G swap for it.
2008-09-06T22:25:00.000Z	Gnea	Kira	there's no reason to have a GUI on a server. you can always export the display over the network.
2008-09-06T22:26:00.000Z	Kira	Gnea	exactly what I have in mind now: export the display over the network.
2008-09-06T22:26:00.000Z	Kira	Gnea	FreeNX, right?
2008-09-06T22:27:00.000Z	Gnea	Kira	uhm, all you need is some sort of *nix running on a desktop or laptop on the network
2008-09-06T22:36:00.000Z	Gnea	Kira	i've decided to write a howto for this, since no one else has done so, and since there are many ways to make it work right.
2008-09-06T22:37:00.000Z	Kira	Gnea	that'd be nice.
2008-09-06T22:38:00.000Z	Gnea	Kira	give me a bit of time, I'll get you a url ;)
2008-09-06T22:38:00.000Z	Kira	Gnea	I am an example of people who want to try out Ubuntu, possibly to use it as a server, but who are too afraid to work without a GUI at first.
2008-09-06T22:41:00.000Z	Gnea	Kira	you should get used to using it as a desktop at first - you can install server programs on it just fine
2008-09-06T22:41:00.000Z	Gnea	Kira	so i think the method you're using is sound
2008-09-06T23:10:00.000Z	Gnea	Kira	that's fairly normal.
2008-09-06T23:10:00.000Z	Kira	Gnea	"Over 32MB while doing nothing! That's outrageous!"
2008-09-06T23:12:00.000Z	Gnea	Kira	it's a database, they're known for being memory hogs
2008-09-07T00:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Kira	still there?
2008-09-07T00:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Kira	got the first version up: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=912294
2009-02-06T12:00:00.000Z	Gnea	Kira	like the contents of the package?
2009-02-06T12:01:00.000Z	Gnea	Kira	write it on a sticky note and paste it to the bottom of your monitor :)
