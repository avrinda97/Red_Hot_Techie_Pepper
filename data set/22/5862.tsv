2007-10-22T12:12:00.000Z	blippe		got high si in top, what to do?
2007-10-22T12:14:00.000Z	jmdc	blippe	can you elaborate a bit?
2007-10-22T12:15:00.000Z	blippe	jmdc	my software interrupt shows up as high as 20% constantly, and i don't even know how to check what causes it
2007-10-22T12:16:00.000Z	jmdc	blippe	do you have processes using a lot of cpu time?
2007-10-22T12:16:00.000Z	blippe	jmdc	nope idle is at 75%
2007-10-22T12:17:00.000Z	jmdc	blippe	that is really bizarre. How long has your system been up?
2007-10-22T12:18:00.000Z	blippe	jmdc	it starts with si at 20%
2007-10-22T12:19:00.000Z	jmdc	blippe	do you have any external hardware plugged in?
2007-10-22T12:19:00.000Z	blippe	jmdc	let me check
2007-10-22T12:20:00.000Z	blippe	jmdc	nope
2007-10-22T12:20:00.000Z	jmdc	blippe	are you running on fairly modern hardware?
2007-10-22T12:21:00.000Z	blippe	jmdc	no, about 4 years old
2007-10-22T12:21:00.000Z	blippe	jmdc	maybe older
2007-10-22T12:22:00.000Z	jmdc	blippe	hmmm. It could be that something is broken in the hardware
2007-10-22T12:22:00.000Z	blippe	jmdc	wouldn't that show up as hi?
2007-10-22T12:22:00.000Z	jmdc	blippe	you'd like to think that, wouldn't you?
2007-10-22T12:22:00.000Z	jmdc	blippe	you're probably right though
2007-10-22T12:23:00.000Z	blippe	jmdc	i can't check which program causes the si?
2007-10-22T12:24:00.000Z	blippe	jmdc	cat /proc/interrupts show the hi's there gotta be a way for si's
2007-10-22T12:25:00.000Z	blippe	jmdc	i am gonna rip out a hdd which might be damaged...
2007-10-22T12:26:00.000Z	jmdc	blippe	okay. I'm trying to find a program that will notice where software interrupts are coming from.
2007-10-22T12:26:00.000Z	jmdc	blippe	but I don't know if that actually exists.
