2006-05-13T07:47:00.000Z	daharon		hey guys.  I'm new to ubuntu.  What is the utility that allows you to easily manipulate init files?
2006-05-13T07:47:00.000Z	daharon		like which ones to load at bootup and what runlevel they occur at
2006-05-13T07:48:00.000Z	daharon		something like rc-update from Gentoo
2006-05-13T07:50:00.000Z	daharon		if I were to type "rc-update show", it would display all the init scripts available, which ones are set to come up at boot, and what run level they will start at
2006-05-13T07:50:00.000Z	nickrud	daharon	sysv-rc-conf
2006-05-13T07:50:00.000Z	daharon	nickrud	ah
2006-05-13T07:50:00.000Z	nickrud	daharon	also, you want to look at update-rc.d
2006-05-13T07:54:00.000Z	nickrud	daharon	when I'm feeling frisky, I telinit to 1 & back :)
2006-06-13T07:45:00.000Z	nickrud	daharon	manually, it's license forbids redistribution from what I hear
2006-06-13T07:45:00.000Z	daharon	nickrud	 well, its in Gentoo's portage, so I figured it would be in apt.
2006-06-13T07:46:00.000Z	nickrud	daharon	this is dfsg territory
2006-06-13T07:46:00.000Z	daharon	nickrud	 dfsg?
2006-06-13T07:47:00.000Z	nickrud	daharon	http://www.debian.org/social_contract
2006-06-13T07:48:00.000Z	nickrud	daharon	you should have a link in a pm
2006-06-13T07:48:00.000Z	daharon	nickrud	thanks
2006-06-13T07:49:00.000Z	nickrud	daharon	things in multiverse don't have to abide by the guidelines, but even there there are limits
2006-06-13T07:49:00.000Z	daharon	nickrud	like it still has to be open source?
2006-06-13T07:50:00.000Z	nickrud	daharon	no, just freely redistributable. For example, sun just changed their license, so it's now in multiverse.
2006-06-13T07:50:00.000Z	nickrud	daharon	erm, sun's java I mean
2006-06-13T07:50:00.000Z	daharon	nickrud	right, ok
2006-06-13T07:51:00.000Z	daharon	nickrud	that makes some sense, since even in Portage, it still downloads from a non-gentoo server.  unlike other packages
2006-06-13T07:51:00.000Z	nickrud	daharon	similar to the msttcorefonts, yes
