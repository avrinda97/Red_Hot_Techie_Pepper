2006-06-02T09:14:00.000Z	Ng	Alth	you need to enable the universe repository
2006-06-02T09:14:00.000Z	Alth	Ng	Universe is enabled.
2006-06-02T09:15:00.000Z	Ng	Alth	have you updated the package lists since doing that?
2006-06-02T09:15:00.000Z	Alth	Ng	deb http://au.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper universe
2006-06-02T09:15:00.000Z	Ng	Alth	easily done ;)
2006-06-21T06:52:00.000Z	Ng	Alth	high-res as in everything is far too big? if so try ctrl-alt-+ until it gets back to normal
2006-06-21T06:54:00.000Z	Ng	Alth	which + key did you use? try the one on the numeric keypad
2006-06-21T06:55:00.000Z	Ng	Alth	that's quite strange. can you type into other windows?
2006-06-21T06:57:00.000Z	Ng	Alth	i'm not sure then, unless you happen to have the RANDR X extension loaded (try running xrandr in a terminal)
2006-06-21T06:59:00.000Z	Ng	Alth	in that case you might be able to use its -s option to switch screen mode
2006-06-21T06:59:00.000Z	Ng	Alth	run xrandr -q to get a list of available modes, then use -s to pick one. see "man xrandr"
2006-06-21T06:59:00.000Z	Ng	Alth	in that case it sounds like you're going to have no choice but to log out :/
