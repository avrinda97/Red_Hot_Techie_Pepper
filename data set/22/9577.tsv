2010-08-04T05:09:00.000Z	ace241		i know ubuntu 5.1 isnt supported where is the best place to look for help?
2010-08-04T05:10:00.000Z	maco	ace241	breezy?  you need to upgrade to a current version
2010-08-04T05:12:00.000Z	maco	ace241	how old is the machine?
2010-08-04T05:12:00.000Z	maco	ace241	you may be better off with xubuntu or lubuntu
2010-08-04T05:14:00.000Z	maco	ace241	xubuntu and lubuntu are made for older systems
2010-08-04T05:18:00.000Z	maco	ace241	a cd upgrade is going to be the least downloading... "dpkg --get-selections > packages"  on the original, then on thhe new install "dpkg --set-selections < packages"   and then "sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade"   thatll automatically reinstall everything you had installed before
2010-08-04T05:21:00.000Z	maco	ace241	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu i think
2010-08-04T05:24:00.000Z	maco	ace241	youll need to reinstall dependencies if you install from cd, but it should figure out dependencies for you when you tell it to install zsnes
2010-08-04T05:25:00.000Z	maco	ace241	oh then yes you need to download them. have you heard of AptOnCD?
2010-08-04T05:26:00.000Z	maco	ace241	packages.ubuntu.com lists the dependencies for all packages
2010-08-04T05:26:00.000Z	maco	ace241	nubuntu? never heard of it
2010-08-04T05:27:00.000Z	maco	ace241	xubuntu traditionally though lubuntu is the new version and a bit lighter weight
2010-08-04T05:27:00.000Z	maco	ace241	by "new version" i mean its a new not-yet-official derivative
2010-08-04T05:46:00.000Z	maco	ace241	packages.ubuntu.com is really the easiest site because it lists the dependencies and links to their download pages
2010-08-04T05:38:00.000Z	maco	ace241	packages.ubuntu.com
2010-08-04T05:40:00.000Z	maco	ace241	yes, lucid is 10.04
2010-08-04T05:40:00.000Z	maco	ace241	AptOnCD lets you make a repo on a cd. there are also companies that sell sets of the entire repositories on like 5 DVDs
2010-08-04T05:45:00.000Z	maco	ace241	you can download them from http://packages.ubuntu.com  you're going to want the versions for lucid not for breezy
2010-08-04T05:47:00.000Z	maco	ace241	many of the dependencies will be part of a default install too, dont foret
2010-08-04T05:47:00.000Z	maco	ace241	like, youll never need to get libc6 for example. thas default installed
2010-08-04T05:51:00.000Z	maco	ace241	how are you going to see the game if you dont have a graphics card?
2010-08-04T05:54:00.000Z	maco	ace241	nes itself didnt even do that
