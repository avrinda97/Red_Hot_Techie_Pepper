2009-11-04T10:23:00.000Z	johnfg		hi folks
2009-11-04T10:24:00.000Z	johnfg		Is there a rescue mode on the karmic i386 desktop cd?
2009-11-04T10:24:00.000Z	johnfg		I wanted to try reinstalling the grub loader, since I can't get karmic to boot.
2009-11-04T10:26:00.000Z	johnfg		To state why I need to try a reinstall of grub: I did a fresh install of karmic-desktop and it won't boot.  All previous ubuntu versions have been in a multi-boot environment, np.
2009-11-04T10:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	johnfg	What happens when you try to boot?
2009-11-04T10:27:00.000Z	johnfg	Jordan_U	Nothing, just the grub line, then one return/enter, then hangs.
2009-11-04T10:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	johnfg	Interesting, try asking in #grub ( and so you know, karmic uses grub2 which uses grub.cfg and is all that they support in #grub )
2009-11-04T10:31:00.000Z	johnfg	Jordan_U	Ubuntu installed grub silently, without asking me for any feedback, and it still wouldn't boot.
2009-11-04T10:32:00.000Z	johnfg	Jordan_U	Did you see my question: does my install cd have a rescue mode?  I thought I'd try reinstalling grub.
2009-11-04T10:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	johnfg	Did you use the liveCD or the alternate CD? The liveCD is one big full fearured rescue mode in itself :)
2009-11-04T10:34:00.000Z	johnfg	Jordan_U	Does that sentence make sense to you in what I did?
2009-11-04T10:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	johnfg	Yes
2009-11-04T10:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	johnfg	Boot the LiveCD and choose the "try ubuntu without any changes" option to boot to a full desktop. From there you can re-install grub, though I don't think that will help
2009-11-04T10:37:00.000Z	johnfg	Jordan_U	Do you think it matters how I installed?  I.e., should I try to install while being booted from the liveCD?
2009-11-04T10:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	johnfg	No, it makes no difference ( it's the same installer )
2009-11-04T10:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	johnfg	You can try installing grub legacy
2009-11-04T10:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	johnfg	But before you do that you should really ask in #grub
2010-03-09T09:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	johnfg	losha, What problem are you having with grub2?
2010-03-09T09:30:00.000Z	johnfg	Jordan_U	I just couldn't get either of the 9's to dual boot, or actually, to boot at all?  The system just hung at the grub prompt.
2010-03-09T09:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	johnfg	That usually means that you have multiple drives and grub was installed to the wrong one ( leaving a broken previous version of grub on the drive you are actually booting from ) or you have a BIOS bug.
2010-03-09T09:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	johnfg	Do you have more than one drive?
2010-03-09T09:40:00.000Z	johnfg	Jordan_U	What do you think?
