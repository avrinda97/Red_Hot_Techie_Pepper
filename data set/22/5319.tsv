2007-12-26T01:48:00.000Z	Andeh		Question: When I boot up ubuntu on this laptop, it says loading kernel, starting up, and then, when the graphical boot loader bar should come in, it goes black. It boots up fine, but this emptiness is creepy. Can I get the graphical boot loader to work?
2007-12-26T01:49:00.000Z	silent_	Andeh	Graphical boot loader? you mean X?
2007-12-26T01:49:00.000Z	Andeh	silent_	I mean that horizontal, orange rectangle that gets bigger and bigger
2007-12-26T01:49:00.000Z	silent_	Andeh	a loading bar?
2007-12-26T01:49:00.000Z	Andeh	silent_	Yes, I said that.
2007-12-26T01:50:00.000Z	Andeh	silent_	Apparently another guy with a laptop has the same problem. He asked here as well.
2007-12-26T01:50:00.000Z	silent_	Andeh	it's probly outputting a graphical format your monitor can't display
2007-12-26T01:50:00.000Z	Andeh	silent_	It shouldn't be, it worked fine in ubuntu 6.10
2007-12-26T01:51:00.000Z	Andeh	silent_	And from what I see on my desktop PC, where it does work, it hasn't changed much or at all.
2007-12-26T01:51:00.000Z	Andeh	silent_	It's not really a PROBLEM, it just sucks more than a black hole.
2007-12-26T01:52:00.000Z	silent_	Andeh	I wouldn't worry about it that much... it isn't a crucial feature
2007-12-26T01:52:00.000Z	silent_	Andeh	you can always hit alt+f1-f4 to check what's happening if it hangs too long
2007-12-26T01:53:00.000Z	Andeh	silent_	Is it possible to make it use a text boot by default, but still load GDM?
2007-12-26T01:53:00.000Z	Andeh	silent_	I am pretty sure you can edit grub to make it do that
2007-12-26T01:53:00.000Z	silent_	Andeh	sure, use the nosplash option
2007-12-26T01:54:00.000Z	silent_	Andeh	I believe the recovery entry has the nosplash option, just copy the syntax from there
2007-12-26T01:54:00.000Z	Andeh	silent_	Ah, great, thanks!
2007-12-26T01:55:00.000Z	silent_	Andeh	np.. just checked my menu.lst, you simply remove the 'spash'
2007-12-26T01:56:00.000Z	Andeh	silent_	I noticed too. Thanks though :)
2007-12-26T01:56:00.000Z	Andeh	silent_	What happens if I remove "quiet"?
2007-12-26T01:57:00.000Z	silent_	Andeh	I'm not sure, I assume it would either use the pcspkr module to output sound... or would output more activity logs for debugging purposes
2007-12-26T01:59:00.000Z	Andeh	silent_	Thanks :)
