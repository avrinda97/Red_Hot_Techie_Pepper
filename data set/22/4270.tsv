2008-03-18T02:18:00.000Z	BinaryFu	lilg111111	Usually, you plug it in, and it will auto mount. It might take a second or two, and if it doesn't automatically give you an icon on your desktop, you might want to go into Places - Computer and see if it's listed in there.
2008-03-18T02:19:00.000Z	BinaryFu	lilg111111	 That's odd. Is the drive formatted?
2008-03-18T02:20:00.000Z	BinaryFu	lilg111111	Hmmm...and it's powering up okay, etc?
2008-03-18T02:31:00.000Z	BinaryFu	lilg111111	What format is it?
2008-03-18T02:33:00.000Z	BinaryFu	lilg111111	I don't think Ubuntu will auto mount an NTFS drive...
2008-03-18T02:34:00.000Z	BinaryFu	lilg111111	Gimmie a minute, someone else asked about mounting ntfs, might as well answer everyone at one shot. :D
2008-03-18T02:46:00.000Z	BinaryFu	lilg111111	That annoying pass, is kinda important.
2008-03-18T02:46:00.000Z	BinaryFu	lilg111111	Good call! :)
2008-03-18T02:47:00.000Z	lilg111111	BinaryFu	im new to linux so i dont know alot of stuff about it
2008-03-18T02:47:00.000Z	BinaryFu	lilg111111	We all were at one time. ;) No worries.
2008-03-18T02:47:00.000Z	lilg111111	BinaryFu	i have a lot of files on this drive is there anything you can think of
2008-03-18T02:48:00.000Z	BinaryFu	lilg111111	For mounting NTFS on an external drive?
2008-03-18T02:49:00.000Z	lilg111111	BinaryFu	yes and is there a specific jumper setting for the drive
2008-03-18T02:49:00.000Z	BinaryFu	lilg111111	It's possible to do, but it's going to take a bit of work to set it up...and I'm betting someone in here could probably walk you through it 100x easier than I could, because I'd have to read up on it on a website to start. :)
2008-03-18T02:49:00.000Z	BinaryFu	lilg111111	As for the jump, yes, 99.99999% of all external drive cases REQUIRE you to set the drive to SINGLE/MASTER setting.
2008-03-18T02:50:00.000Z	lilg111111	BinaryFu	thanx, ill try it
2008-03-18T02:52:00.000Z	lilg111111	BinaryFu	i think my jumper setting is wrong, i have to find it out
2008-03-18T02:52:00.000Z	BinaryFu	lilg111111	Yeah, get that set right first, then life might be easier for you. :)
