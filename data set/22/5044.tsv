2007-08-18T06:48:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		do i need to install dmraid to access my ntfs raid devices???
2007-08-18T06:48:00.000Z	dystopianray	Xsss4hell	most likely
2007-08-18T06:49:00.000Z	dystopianray	Xsss4hell	are they dynamic volumes, software raid, fake raid, or hardware raid?
2007-08-18T06:49:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		dynamic volumes and hardware raid
2007-08-18T06:49:00.000Z	dystopianray	Xsss4hell	Xsss4hell is it just one dynamic volume on top of hardware raid?
2007-08-18T06:49:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		no two
2007-08-18T06:50:00.000Z	dystopianray	Xsss4hell	are they spanned or striped dynamic volumes at all?
2007-08-18T06:50:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		two hardware raids
2007-08-18T06:50:00.000Z	dystopianray	Xsss4hell	is it a proper hardawre raid or a shitty 'onboard raid controller that needs a driver in windows' fake raid?
2007-08-18T06:51:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		onboard
2007-08-18T06:51:00.000Z	dystopianray	Xsss4hell	ok so it's fake raid, things become much trickier
2007-08-18T06:51:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		the dynamic volumes are not spanned or striped, just the two hardware raids that act as two independant stripes
2007-08-18T06:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	Xsss4hell	if it's onboard it's fake raid, not hardware raid
2007-08-18T06:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	Xsss4hell	you probably will need dmraid
2007-08-18T06:52:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		oh didn't know that
2007-08-18T06:52:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		k installed
2007-08-18T06:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	Xsss4hell	it's fake becuase it's a software assisted raid, the driver does most of the raid work
2007-08-18T06:53:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		aha
2007-08-18T06:53:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		fine
2007-08-18T06:57:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	dystopianray	how do I proceed
2007-08-18T06:57:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		dmraid -ay
2007-08-18T06:57:00.000Z	dystopianray	Xsss4hell	i don't know, i've never used dmraid before
