2005-05-24T07:25:00.000Z	ram_einstein		hi all~ I want to know how to "format" my USB stick
2005-05-24T07:26:00.000Z	ram_einstein		... and find out it's filesystem
2005-05-24T07:27:00.000Z	ram_einstein		not need to
2005-05-24T07:27:00.000Z	ram_einstein		what filesystems do your USB sticks use Selanit and jeroen_?
2005-05-24T07:27:00.000Z	ram_einstein		:( Selanit!
2005-05-24T07:27:00.000Z	jeroen_	ram_einstein	I don't have an usb-stick, but I would format if fat32 for use @ school
2005-05-24T07:30:00.000Z	jeroen_	ram_einstein	differents port may use usb1 or 2
2005-05-24T07:31:00.000Z	jeroen_	ram_einstein	the stick may not support usb2 (i think)
2005-05-24T07:35:00.000Z	jeroen_	ram_einstein	try both and test the speed :p
2005-05-24T07:35:00.000Z	ram_einstein	jeroen_	can you explain a very high speed data transfer then?
2005-05-24T07:36:00.000Z	jeroen_	ram_einstein	usb1 is slow, usb2 is faaast
2005-05-24T07:36:00.000Z	jeroen_	ram_einstein	you could also try system -> administration -> Device Manager
2005-05-24T07:37:00.000Z	ram_einstein	jeroen_	one is slow
2005-05-24T07:37:00.000Z	jeroen_	ram_einstein	and look for usb controller
2005-05-24T07:37:00.000Z	jeroen_	ram_einstein	and see whether it's 1.1 or 2
2005-05-24T07:39:00.000Z	jeroen_	ram_einstein	does it say transcend on your usbstick?
2005-05-24T07:40:00.000Z	jeroen_	ram_einstein	then find the usb 2.0 port, and stick it in there
2005-05-24T07:44:00.000Z	jeroen_	ram_einstein	that's weird. And it works in the other slot? Maybe it's defunct? (the slot)
2005-05-24T07:44:00.000Z	jeroen_	ram_einstein	bizarre
2005-05-24T07:54:00.000Z	jeroen_	ram_einstein	I'm back..
2005-06-19T07:37:00.000Z	jeroen_	ram_einstein	dependencies
2005-06-19T07:38:00.000Z	ram_einstein	jeroen_	but I thought apt takes care of that...
