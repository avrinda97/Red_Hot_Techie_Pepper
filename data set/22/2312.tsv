2009-07-20T00:50:00.000Z	sbradley33		Hello, I'm quite new to Linux.  Windows is my bread and butter.  I think I have a driver for my webcam but it is a .gz file.  Can anyone help me install it please?
2009-07-20T00:50:00.000Z	notmyname	sbradley33	.gz is a gzip file. uncompress it with gunzip <filename here>
2009-07-20T00:52:00.000Z	sbradley33	notmyname	Thank you, what should I be looking for for the installer?
2009-07-20T00:54:00.000Z	notmyname	sbradley33	that depends. there is no standard way, but there are some common ones
2009-07-20T00:54:00.000Z	notmyname	sbradley33	I'm assuming that you have a folder after you uncompress it?
2009-07-20T00:54:00.000Z	sbradley33	notmyname	yes I do
2009-07-20T00:55:00.000Z	sbradley33	notmyname	I'm going throught the 'ReadMe' now
2009-07-20T00:55:00.000Z	notmyname	sbradley33	and in that folder, do you have a .deb file? a setup.py file? a configure script and a Makefile?
2009-07-20T00:55:00.000Z	notmyname	sbradley33	the README is a great start :-)
2009-07-20T00:56:00.000Z	sbradley33	notmyname	I do have a Makefile
2009-07-20T00:56:00.000Z	notmyname	sbradley33	then the readme probably says do something like "./configure" then "make" then "sudo make install". am I right?
2009-07-20T00:58:00.000Z	sbradley33	notmyname	Yeah, but all it says is to run 'make install' and then to load the usb modules
2009-07-20T00:59:00.000Z	sbradley33	notmyname	I tried to run make install but the system tells me 'make: *** No rule to make target 'install'. Stop.
2009-07-20T00:59:00.000Z	notmyname	sbradley33	is there a Makefile in that folder?
2009-07-20T01:00:00.000Z	sbradley33	notmyname	OH, duh, I have to be in the folder...*V8*
2009-07-20T01:01:00.000Z	sbradley33	notmyname	I did the sudo -i command to get root, but I'm not sure how to find which folder to go into
2009-07-20T01:02:00.000Z	notmyname	sbradley33	the make command will look for a Makefile in the current directory. therefore you will need to be in the unzipped directory
2009-07-20T01:02:00.000Z	sbradley33	notmyname	Yup, I just don't know how to get ther from root
2009-07-20T01:03:00.000Z	notmyname	sbradley33	cd path/to/foler/or/file
2009-07-20T01:04:00.000Z	sbradley33	notmyname	thank you, and I do have to be logged in as sudo -i, correct?
2009-07-20T01:05:00.000Z	notmyname	sbradley33	no, you can just prefix the command you are running with sudo
2009-07-20T01:05:00.000Z	sbradley33	notmyname	ah
