2011-06-07T09:50:00.000Z	rinkukokiri		WHY can't i get my nvidia drivers to be in use
2011-06-07T09:50:00.000Z	rinkukokiri		they are stuck at 'enabled, not in use'
2011-06-07T09:50:00.000Z	rinkukokiri		NEVER HAD THIS ISSUE WITH 10.XX AND PRIOR
2011-06-07T09:51:00.000Z	rinkukokiri		so, they come out with a new release.      everything breaks, and they call it a success.
2011-06-07T09:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	rinkukokiri	check your Xorg logs or "lspci -vnvn" find the VGA section and 'kernel driver in use' -- i think it's a reporting bug of the driver tool, the driver is probably in use actually.
2011-06-07T09:56:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	ZykoticK9	lapaga   here's all my relevant info i knew to post ... http://askubuntu.com/questions/47378/nvidia-current-drivers-enabled-not-in-use-help
2011-06-07T09:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	rinkukokiri	do you have 3d acceleration working?  it is showing kernel as both nvidia-current and nouveau (open source, probably non 3d)
2011-06-07T10:00:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	rinkukokiri	do you get reasonable frame rate?  even better, can you run Unity or Compiz?
2011-06-07T10:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	rinkukokiri	i think if you can run Unity that your Nvidia driver is being used - it's just Jockey that's misreporting.  Several people have visited this channel with the same issue.
2011-06-07T10:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	rinkukokiri	i think this is the bug you should have marked yourself as being "affected by" https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/jockey/+bug/771788
2011-06-07T10:24:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	ZykoticK9	well, looks like they'll have to mark a dupe and geton it
2011-06-07T10:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	rinkukokiri	you could actually
2011-06-07T10:26:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	ZykoticK9	done.
2011-06-07T11:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	rinkukokiri	thus OT for this channel
2011-06-11T22:14:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	ZykoticK9	huh?
2011-06-11T22:14:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	ZykoticK9	what's that about?
2011-06-11T22:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	rinkukokiri	you asked for a !impatent factoid - i though i gave you one ;)
2011-06-12T01:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	rinkukokiri	firefox or flash?
2011-06-12T01:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	rinkukokiri	hum, that is surprising then.  Most issues are flash and not the browser in question.  Best of luck.
2011-06-12T01:59:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	ZykoticK9	it happens in windows too
2011-06-12T02:01:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	ZykoticK9	guess it /could/ be flash, I forgot about gmail using flash ....
2011-06-12T02:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	rinkukokiri	chromium gets the new features first
