2011-06-28T05:28:00.000Z	em	PythonSnake	or in nautilus go to view > show hidden files
2011-06-28T05:29:00.000Z	PythonSnake	em	Thanks a lot for your help
2011-06-28T05:29:00.000Z	em	PythonSnake	then you should see it with a .dot-like name. And you can browse like any other folder.
2011-06-28T05:29:00.000Z	em	PythonSnake	okay sure. If you have any more easy ones like that keep em' comin :P
2011-06-28T05:30:00.000Z	PythonSnake	em	is it normal that I removed partitions, remade them and reinstalled ubuntu and files are still there ?
2011-06-28T05:31:00.000Z	em	PythonSnake	It's not impossible that you could reinstall ubuntu and still see old files if the installer did not format some old partitions. In fact many people do that intentionally with a separate home directory.
2011-06-28T05:32:00.000Z	PythonSnake	em	Where can be old files so I delete ?
2011-06-28T05:32:00.000Z	em	PythonSnake	that way they can reinstall Ubuntu but their /home is on its own partition and does not get formated so they have a fresh Ubuntu but with their old files intact.
2011-06-28T05:32:00.000Z	em	PythonSnake	That I don't know.
2011-06-28T05:32:00.000Z	PythonSnake	em	I installed with live
2011-06-28T05:34:00.000Z	em	PythonSnake	in a folder ?
2011-06-28T05:36:00.000Z	PythonSnake	em	can drivers break my interface ?
2011-06-28T05:39:00.000Z	PythonSnake	em	I meant xorg broken
2011-06-28T05:40:00.000Z	em	PythonSnake	Oh well that's a tricky one. Modern Ubuntu does not work with xorg.conf anymore.
2011-06-28T05:41:00.000Z	em	PythonSnake	I am not qualified to answer that question. I would think that drivers could mess up a lot of things. I don't think Modern Ubuntu even uses xorg.conf to deal with your drivers anymore though. It's supposed to just somehow recognize it.
2011-06-28T05:46:00.000Z	PythonSnake	em	Do you know a good interface or file manager ?
