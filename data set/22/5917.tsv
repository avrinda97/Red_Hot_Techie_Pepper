2007-01-22T13:40:00.000Z	slyfox		What do you people use for Quick Launching applicaitons ?
2007-01-22T13:40:00.000Z	bruenig	slyfox	keyboard shortcuts
2007-01-22T13:41:00.000Z	slyfox	bruenig	is there a special program for that?
2007-01-22T13:42:00.000Z	bruenig	slyfox	well I am no xfce so keyboard shortcuts attached to commands is standard. You can add two packages xbindkeys and xbindkeys-config which will allow you to bind any key combination with any command and so from that just bind a combination with the command to launch a program.
2007-01-22T13:54:00.000Z	bruenig	slyfox	you don't need to do the editor export unless nano makes you crazy
2007-01-22T13:55:00.000Z	bruenig	slyfox	sudo -s && crontab -e -u root
2007-01-22T13:56:00.000Z	slyfox	bruenig	did it, nothing happend
2007-01-22T13:56:00.000Z	bruenig	slyfox	something had to have happened
2007-01-22T13:56:00.000Z	slyfox	bruenig	nothing, what does this command mean and do ?
2007-04-08T06:57:00.000Z	bruenig	slyfox	you can use "rename"
2007-04-08T06:58:00.000Z	bruenig	slyfox	are all these files in the same directory or are they in a variety of directories?
2007-04-08T06:58:00.000Z	slyfox	bruenig	same dir
2007-04-08T06:59:00.000Z	bruenig	slyfox	cd into the directory and do this "rename s/\.MOD$/.mpg/' *.MOD
2007-04-08T06:59:00.000Z	slyfox	bruenig	let me try
2007-04-08T07:02:00.000Z	bruenig	slyfox	that command should work, what happened
2007-04-08T07:02:00.000Z	bruenig	slyfox	you said you had a bunch of .MOD and you want to change them to .mpg right
2007-04-08T07:02:00.000Z	slyfox	bruenig	what happend was that my files are located on a windows smb share and I do not know how to get there via commadn line
2007-04-08T07:03:00.000Z	bruenig	slyfox	oh woops, I forgot to escape that second period. do this: rename s/\.MOD$/\.mpg/' *.MOD
2007-04-08T07:03:00.000Z	slyfox	bruenig	I have no idea how to get here via command line smb://192.168.1.7/G/Photos/Family/2007/2007.03.25%20-%20Family%20Cruise/Camera%20Videos/1
2007-04-08T07:03:00.000Z	slyfox	bruenig	I will just use the gui program
2007-04-08T07:03:00.000Z	slyfox	bruenig	it is called PreffixSuffix
2007-04-08T07:04:00.000Z	bruenig	slyfox	yeah, probably far less powerful than rename or anything else
