2007-04-22T08:17:00.000Z	dauoalagio2		how can i share folders wirelessly between two ubuntu computers?
2007-04-22T08:18:00.000Z	msand	dauoalagio2	system > Administration > shared Folders lets you share folders over a network
2007-04-22T08:19:00.000Z	dauoalagio2	msand	no gui - x won't start,
2007-04-22T08:19:00.000Z	msand		ah, okay.  Well, you can use samba for it.
2007-04-22T08:19:00.000Z	msand		I only ever share with windows.. but you don't need to include a windows box on the network for it to work
2007-04-22T08:21:00.000Z	msand	dauoalagio2	samba's pretty easy to configure through the command line
2007-04-22T08:22:00.000Z	msand		Well, for basic sharing it is.  I use it on a lan, so I don't worry too much about security.  Just basic username/password check.  No complaints
2007-04-22T08:23:00.000Z	dauoalagio2	msand	how to anywhere?
2007-04-22T08:24:00.000Z	msand	dauoalagio2	plenty.  I'm looking for the one I used when I first set it up.
2007-04-22T08:24:00.000Z	dauoalagio2	msand	thanks
2007-04-22T08:28:00.000Z	msand	dauoalagio2	I can't find the one I used, but I might be able to walk you through it if you don't need to do anything unusual
2007-04-22T08:29:00.000Z	dauoalagio2	msand	nah i just need files from a computer that's screwed over to a working ubuntu computer
2007-04-22T08:31:00.000Z	msand	dauoalagio2	ah.. and scp's no good?
2007-04-22T08:32:00.000Z	dauoalagio2	msand	scp?
2007-04-22T08:33:00.000Z	msand	dauoalagio2	it works like cp but across computers
2007-04-22T08:33:00.000Z	dauoalagio2	msand	sounds fine, does cp work with folders>
2007-04-22T08:33:00.000Z	dauoalagio2		?*
2007-04-22T08:34:00.000Z	msand	dauoalagio2	sure does.  If you specify a folder instead of a file, it'll copy the whole folder
2007-04-22T08:35:00.000Z	dauoalagio2	msand	sounds perfect
2007-04-22T08:35:00.000Z	msand	dauoalagio2	you'd need  to know the full path.. can't tab for the remote folders, I think.
