2012-02-09T08:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scope	add the boot option: i8024.nopnp   and it will work, dumb vaios need that for their tyouchpads to work a LOT of the time
2012-02-09T08:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scope	run:  gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub
2012-02-09T08:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scope	find the line with:  quiet splash    and add the option in the quotes, save the new file, close gedit and run:  sudo update-grub
2012-02-09T08:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scope	yes
2012-02-09T08:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scope	if you immediately say 'i don't know' without even attempting to try and find out how to do stuff yourself or even have a go, you will never learn your OS, or in fact ANYTHING in life
2012-02-09T08:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scope	read the text
2012-02-09T08:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scope	you can alt+tab without issue and you can press CTRL+ALT+T to run a terminal, no mouse needed
2012-02-09T08:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scope	I can't phrase it any easier, run the command I gave and add the option in the quotes
2012-02-09T08:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scope	its dead handy :)
2012-02-09T08:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scope	run:  gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub
2012-02-09T08:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scope	are you using KDE ?
2012-02-09T08:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scope	Maverick is EOL in 2 months, I wouldn't waste any time on it and go for Oneiric
2012-02-09T08:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scope	grab the Oneiric ISO, burn it slowly to a CD after MD5 testing it and boot to it
2012-02-09T08:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scope	be sure your backups are up to date, delete the Maverick partitions and install to the new free space
2012-02-09T08:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scope	hardly..
