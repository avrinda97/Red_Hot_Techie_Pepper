2006-06-22T12:56:00.000Z	NoUse	Hoxzer_	why do you need to compile gparted?
2006-06-22T12:56:00.000Z	Hoxzer_	NoUse	Because ubuntu has version 0.1 which doesn't regonize my disk althought disk-manager does which sucks .. SO MUCH
2006-06-22T12:57:00.000Z	NoUse	Hoxzer_	just get the gparted livecd,
2006-06-22T12:57:00.000Z	Hoxzer_	NoUse	? why what would it HELP?
2006-06-22T12:57:00.000Z	Hoxzer_	NoUse	:D I cannot install it to disk if I can't get ubuntu install to regonize my disk
2006-06-22T12:57:00.000Z	NoUse	Hoxzer_	if you need gparted 2.5, that has it
2006-06-22T12:57:00.000Z	Hoxzer_	NoUse	Yeah, but I need it when I install Ubuntu 6.06 ...
2006-06-22T12:57:00.000Z	Hoxzer_	NoUse	it already has linux partition in it
2006-06-22T12:58:00.000Z	NoUse	Hoxzer_	ah, I thought just gparted wasn't working, the enitre OS doesn't see your disk?
2006-06-22T12:59:00.000Z	Hoxzer_	NoUse	well ... OS DOES but 6.06 install uses Gparted ...
2006-06-22T12:59:00.000Z	NoUse	Hoxzer_	you don't have to use gparted in the install
2006-06-22T12:59:00.000Z	NoUse	Hoxzer_	or just get the alternate cd
2006-06-22T13:00:00.000Z	Hoxzer_	NoUse	.... alternate? EH :E
2006-06-22T13:00:00.000Z	NoUse	Hoxzer_	its the text based install
2006-06-22T13:00:00.000Z	NoUse	Hoxzer_	might work better
2006-06-22T13:01:00.000Z	NoUse	Hoxzer_	no
2006-06-22T13:01:00.000Z	Hoxzer_	NoUse	 ......... what happend 5.1 WAS much easier to install
2006-06-22T13:02:00.000Z	NoUse	Hoxzer_	I had no problems wiht dapper
