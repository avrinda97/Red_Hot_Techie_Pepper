2009-09-26T22:51:00.000Z	Casper1		can some1 help me with using a custom icon
2009-09-26T22:52:00.000Z	Casper1		with an application launcher in wine
2009-09-26T22:53:00.000Z	Casper1		HazeFace: I saved it as an ico and a svg and a png. none of them work. also made sure it was the same size as the other fonts in that folder
2009-09-26T22:54:00.000Z	n8bounds	Casper1	what are you trying to do, exactly?
2009-09-26T22:55:00.000Z	n8bounds	Casper1	in gnome?
2009-09-26T22:56:00.000Z	Casper1	n8bounds	yes
2009-09-26T22:57:00.000Z	n8bounds	Casper1	you just click on the icon box and select a supported graphic file: http://drbrainiac.wordpress.com/2007/11/04/how-to-create-custom-desktop-launchers-in-ubuntu-gnome/
2009-09-26T22:59:00.000Z	Casper1	n8bounds	thats for older versions of linux
2009-09-26T23:01:00.000Z	n8bounds	Casper1	what version are you using? on my 9.04, when i create a custom launcher, i can click on the ugly springboard thing and choose a file to assign as its icon
2009-09-26T23:02:00.000Z	Casper1	n8bounds	 9.04. i did click the spring, but my custom icon doesnt come up in the menu
2009-09-26T23:02:00.000Z	n8bounds	Casper1	you have to change the address to the location of the icon
2009-09-26T23:02:00.000Z	n8bounds	Casper1	and it cant be an .ico file
2009-09-26T23:03:00.000Z	Casper1	n8bounds	doesnt show up still. even if i hit ctrl-h
2009-09-26T23:04:00.000Z	n8bounds	Casper1	the path must be wrong or the file must be invalid, or you dont have proper perms to it, that's the only explanations i can come up with
2009-09-26T23:05:00.000Z	Casper1	n8bounds	how do i change the permisions? i am admin on the computer tho so i dont think thats it
2009-09-26T23:05:00.000Z	Casper1	n8bounds	and i tried every file extension that has to do with images
2009-09-26T23:06:00.000Z	n8bounds	Casper1	you just tell gnome where the dir of the file IS and choose if from the resulting list, if it doesnt like your file's format, or cant read/open it, then it wont show it to you
2009-09-26T23:06:00.000Z	Casper1	n8bounds	sigh i give up
2009-09-26T23:07:00.000Z	Casper1	n8bounds	thx anyway
2009-09-26T23:07:00.000Z	n8bounds	Casper1	sure, sorry
