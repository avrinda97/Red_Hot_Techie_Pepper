2006-10-27T12:33:00.000Z	kitche	nolimitsoya	well you will have to wait 90 days or if you know the password you can ghost it
2006-10-27T12:33:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	kitche	i know the pass. how do i ghost it?
2006-10-27T12:34:00.000Z	kitche	nolimitsoya	/nickserv ghost <user> <pass>

2006-10-27T12:38:00.000Z	kitche	nolimitsoya	just change your nick to the other nickname so you can change your password
2006-11-10T10:40:00.000Z	kitche	nolimitsoya	umm partimage makes a disk image just that it uses .tar.gz but uses an extension of like 100 and such instead of .tar.gz|bz2
2006-11-10T10:41:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	kitche	but still, a disk image is inferior to a tarball :)
2006-11-11T14:04:00.000Z	kitche	nolimitsoya	probably because it's beta *shrugs*
2006-11-11T14:05:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	kitche	yepp, but it seems tobe working a great deal better than flash7, at least for me...
2006-11-21T15:42:00.000Z	kitche	nolimitsoya	it's in Kcontrol
2006-11-21T15:42:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	kitche	thank you :)
2006-11-21T15:47:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	kitche	i cant seem to find it. could you give me a hint? i feel like a complete idiot. :)
2006-11-21T15:47:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	kitche	never mind, found it
2006-11-21T15:48:00.000Z	kitche	nolimitsoya	ok :) it's been a whiel sicne I use KDE but I knew it was on the control panel
2006-11-29T16:59:00.000Z	kitche	nolimitsoya	I think beryl-project.org is still down they had a hard drive failure
2006-12-01T15:24:00.000Z	kitche	nolimitsoya	think it's in .wine
2006-12-01T15:32:00.000Z	kitche	nolimitsoya	so you can't remove that menu item though kde's way?
2006-12-18T17:46:00.000Z	kitche	nolimitsoya	 Ubotwo never had package searching
2006-12-18T17:47:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	kitche	but ubotu did :) what happend to him?
2006-12-18T17:47:00.000Z	kitche	nolimitsoya	probably having problems that's when Ubotwo comes in usually
