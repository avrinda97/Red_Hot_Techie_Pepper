2008-04-26T06:18:00.000Z	jeeves__		ha anyone here figured out why the toshiba P100 will play sound through the speakers, but not through the headphones?
2008-04-26T06:19:00.000Z	jeeves__		alsa sound issues?  anyone?
2008-04-26T06:19:00.000Z	dassouki	jeeves__	ya i have sound issues
2008-04-26T06:19:00.000Z	jeeves__	dassouki	did you ever figure out how to fix it?
2008-04-26T06:19:00.000Z	dassouki	jeeves__	no sweet clue
2008-04-26T06:20:00.000Z	jeeves__	dassouki	wow, I've had more problems with this laptop than I have had with a rack full of servers
2008-04-26T06:21:00.000Z	dassouki	jeeves__	my sound was working perfectly on 7.10 until i upgraded
2008-04-26T06:21:00.000Z	jeeves__	dassouki	I had the oppisate problem.  my sound wouldn't work @ all untill I upgraded.  now if I can fix the random freezing, the black lines over menu buttons, and this sound issue, then I'm switching tottaly to Ubuntu
2008-04-26T06:23:00.000Z	dassouki	jeeves__	black lines over menu ?
2008-04-26T06:24:00.000Z	jeeves__	dassouki	if I open a new window, the menu buttons and the menu items (ie. file, view, etc) will have a back bar over them.  I think it's somehow related to my random freezing problem
2008-04-26T06:25:00.000Z	dassouki	jeeves__	did u do a fresh install or an upgrade? is ur graphics card working properly? have u tried reinstalling ubuntu-desktop?
2008-04-26T06:26:00.000Z	jeeves__	dassouki	at first, I thought it was a bad upgrade, so I blew it away and reinstalled.  My graphics card has no issues under M$.
2008-04-26T06:26:00.000Z	dassouki	jeeves__	MS .... well i meant it as graphic cards drivers
2008-04-26T06:26:00.000Z	jeeves__	dassouki	ahhh, I'm using the restricted driver set
2008-04-26T06:27:00.000Z	dassouki	jeeves__	i take it as u have an nvidea ?
2008-04-26T06:27:00.000Z	jeeves__	dassouki	how'd you guess?
2008-04-26T06:28:00.000Z	dassouki	jeeves__	 i used to get black screen flashes on nvidia. the driver takes some googling to get it to work, but once it does, it's a beauty
2008-04-26T06:28:00.000Z	jeeves__	dassouki	any recomended pages?
2008-04-26T06:29:00.000Z	dassouki	jeeves__	ubuntu forums are good, just try everything until it works.
2008-04-26T06:30:00.000Z	dassouki	jeeves__	ya that's the thing with linux, once it runs it's perfect, a lot easier to maintain than ms
2008-04-26T06:30:00.000Z	jeeves__	dassouki	hence why all of our front end systems and networking equipment runs on linux.  I just can't be bothered to set up dumb things like video and sound.  hence why this is annoying me on my laptop
2008-04-26T06:31:00.000Z	dassouki	jeeves__	i recommend u install 7.10 and consult with the nvidia main page for drivers. but ubuntu has an "nv" driver that i used for a few years
