2011-01-05T22:48:00.000Z	Geekneeus	slipttees	What is your question?
2011-01-05T22:48:00.000Z	slipttees	Geekneeus	Mac address changes at reboot
2011-01-05T22:49:00.000Z	slipttees	Geekneeus	every
2011-01-05T22:49:00.000Z	Geekneeus	slipttees	Do you have any scripts within preup of the /etc/network/interfaces file?
2011-01-05T22:51:00.000Z	slipttees	Geekneeus	static ip only
2011-01-05T22:52:00.000Z	Geekneeus	slipttees	I am not sure what your problem is but you could create a script that does ifconfig eth1 hw ether 00:00:00:00:00 where 00:00... is your desired mac
2011-01-05T22:52:00.000Z	slipttees	Geekneeus	no ideia?
2011-01-05T22:53:00.000Z	slipttees	Geekneeus	maybe....hardware problem?
2011-01-05T22:55:00.000Z	Geekneeus	slipttees	Usually hardware comes with a predetermined mac address to my knowledge, I don't know for sure, but I don't see why it would be a hardware issue
2011-01-05T22:56:00.000Z	slipttees	Geekneeus	reboot, create new line, other device eth** and new mac address in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
2011-01-05T22:57:00.000Z	slipttees	Geekneeus	now i have 10 eth =]~
2011-01-05T22:59:00.000Z	slipttees	Geekneeus	random mac address after reboot
2011-01-05T23:00:00.000Z	Geekneeus	slipttees	I am aware of your issue, please be patient and somebody more suitable may be able to answer your question
2011-01-05T23:08:00.000Z	slipttees	Geekneeus	okay...pay new Ethernet =]
