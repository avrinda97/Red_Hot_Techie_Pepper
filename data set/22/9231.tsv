2011-09-01T03:37:00.000Z	Success		hey how come no web gl in google chrome nor firefox
2011-09-01T03:39:00.000Z	Success		canvas 3d
2011-09-01T03:39:00.000Z	Success		idk how
2011-09-01T03:39:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	simpler put, do normal 3D programs work?
2011-09-01T03:43:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	first install mesa-utils if you haven't already. Then $ glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer string"
2011-09-01T03:44:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	mesa-utils is literally like 3MB. Get over it.
2011-09-01T03:47:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	you typo'd
2011-09-01T03:48:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	what's the renderer string?
2011-09-01T03:55:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	the actual 3D capabilities in Gallium are still kinda limited unfortunately
2011-09-01T03:57:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	you could try the "fglrx" driver but it brings its own set of issues (mostly instability and some hideous compositing artifacts)
2011-09-01T03:57:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	basically, ATI and Linux don't mix very well
2011-09-01T03:59:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	the ATI-driver-for-Linux situation is pretty bleak. AMD is desperately trying to phase out fglrx, but the alternative, DRI, is simply *not ready*.
2011-09-01T04:00:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	fglrx is a hot mess. I'd try getting the latest DRI first.
2011-09-01T04:03:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	well, if you want to go that route, give it a reboot, it should switch as it boots next
2011-09-01T04:04:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	if your Firefox is new enough you should have limited webgl support right now
2011-09-01T04:05:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	I don't know about chrome, sorry. Though a new enough version *should* have some support
2011-09-01T04:05:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	let's not start that here ;)
2011-09-01T04:07:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	I'm curious, what do you want webgl for?
2011-09-01T04:08:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	you have an example?
2011-09-01T04:11:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	works here... but I've got a GeForce running the official drivers so it should
2011-09-01T04:12:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	odd you'd get that specific error
2011-09-01T04:13:00.000Z	roothorick	Success	yeah, it's not initializing properly because your driver has limited support
