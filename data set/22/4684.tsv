2008-07-05T13:19:00.000Z	zcat[1]		somewhere along the line I made a script for my laptop that makes it remove and probe the b43 module so wireless gets restarted properly. I could go look and see how I did it..
2008-07-05T13:20:00.000Z	Peddy	zcat[1]	this is me :D
2008-07-05T13:21:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Peddy	cool. I think just look at the scripts that are there, then write something similar that does what you want.. the numbers are for the order things get done..
2008-07-05T13:21:00.000Z	Peddy	zcat[1]	I'll try that, thanks. Suspending.
2008-07-05T13:25:00.000Z	Peddy	zcat[1]	ok, it's not working. What format should the script be in?
2008-07-05T13:32:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Peddy	/etc/acpi/resume.d/ is where I added my hack.. there may be a simlink somewhere else though like /etc/init.d scripts.. I added to a script that was already there
2008-07-05T13:33:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Peddy	don't forget it also needs to be chmod +x
2008-07-05T13:34:00.000Z	Peddy	zcat[1]	so where should I add my script? Should I add it to a pre-existing one even though they won't be related?
2008-07-05T13:34:00.000Z	Peddy	zcat[1]	Yeah, all the perms are set
2008-07-05T13:35:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Peddy	hang on, just testing something
2008-07-05T13:37:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Peddy	nope, adding a totally new script doesn't work for me either.. there must be a link from somewhere else.. I dunno.
2008-07-05T13:38:00.000Z	Peddy	zcat[1]	I'm putting stuff in rc.d and init.d, brb
2008-07-05T13:40:00.000Z	Peddy	zcat[1]	still doesn't work.. any ideas?
2008-07-05T13:41:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Peddy	nope. someone else here might know.. I gtg anyway..
2008-10-18T12:22:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Peddy	apache
2008-10-18T12:23:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Peddy	apt-get install apache, then drop the files to be shared in /var/www
2008-10-18T12:23:00.000Z	Peddy	zcat[1]	ok, thanks. I was looking into that before. BobCFC, I'll have a look, but I want tcp/ip not Samba or nfs or w/e.
2008-10-18T12:24:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Peddy	you mean http, not smb, etc...
2008-10-18T12:26:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Peddy	for really easy sharing sudo chmod a+rw /var/www (as long as you don't have any 'hostile users' on your machine) and then just make a shortcut to it
2008-10-18T12:26:00.000Z	Peddy	zcat[1]	ok, I can get the files by using http://localhost, but I can't access via my local IP. How do I expose it? Thanks :D
2008-10-18T12:26:00.000Z	Peddy	zcat[1]	nevermind, I had to wait a few seconds.
2008-10-18T12:26:00.000Z	Peddy	zcat[1]	thanks for your help, I'ma get dinner. Bye.
