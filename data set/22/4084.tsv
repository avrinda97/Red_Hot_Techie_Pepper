2008-06-23T15:33:00.000Z	om3ga		because my laptop's dvd drive is broken
2008-06-23T15:34:00.000Z	om3ga		so i tried installing it on another computer....my external HDD has 2 partitions
2008-06-23T15:35:00.000Z	om3ga		the intallation process is until step 3 or 4 only
2008-06-23T15:36:00.000Z	om3ga		it tells me that i dont have a root
2008-06-23T15:36:00.000Z	om3ga		but i can see my external drives in the selection
2008-06-23T15:37:00.000Z	om3ga		but when i move forward it tells me that i dont have a root
2008-06-23T15:39:00.000Z	om3ga		how can i do that?
2008-06-23T15:39:00.000Z	om3ga		sorry...i'm really new in using ubuntu
2008-06-23T15:40:00.000Z	om3ga		live
2008-06-23T15:40:00.000Z	om3ga		i have the cd with me
2008-06-23T15:41:00.000Z	DistroJockey	om3ga	you need to partition the drive so that you have a root "/" partition
2008-06-23T15:42:00.000Z	DistroJockey	om3ga	is it blank?
2008-06-23T15:42:00.000Z	DistroJockey	om3ga	you are doing an install on a totally clean disk?
2008-06-23T15:43:00.000Z	DistroJockey	om3ga	well, the installer won't let you go further without a  /  partition
2008-06-23T15:44:00.000Z	DistroJockey	om3ga	back them up if you havn't
2008-06-23T15:45:00.000Z	DistroJockey	om3ga	I'd backup to a separate drive
2008-06-23T15:46:00.000Z	DistroJockey	om3ga	you are messing around with filesystems/partitions, always have a backup
2008-06-23T15:46:00.000Z	DistroJockey	om3ga	not necessarily, but better safe than sorry
2008-06-23T15:48:00.000Z	DistroJockey	om3ga	you can
2008-06-23T15:49:00.000Z	DistroJockey	om3ga	you can do all sorts of things, just have a backup on another drive that isn't connected
2008-06-23T15:51:00.000Z	DistroJockey	om3ga	I just don't want to give you instructions that may cause you to lose data :)
2008-06-23T15:51:00.000Z	DistroJockey	om3ga	and dealing with disks and partitioning, there is always that chance
