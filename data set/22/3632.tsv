2008-07-14T16:48:00.000Z	TecR0c		but don't i have to install the vnc viewer on them ?
2008-07-14T16:49:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	TecR0c	No you need to install the vnc server on them. the vnc viewer is just needed for the computer you are sitting on
2008-07-14T16:50:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	TecR0c	I had a tool I don't remember the name. it was commercial but pretty cheap I think 50bucks It could install vnc-server automatically on machines I selected in the "Active Directory Domain" I was the Domain Admin of course
2008-07-14T16:51:00.000Z	TecR0c	Xsss4hell	Yeah that tool would be useful
2008-07-14T16:51:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		I TecR0c I was able to control the machines/servers remote or even make my changes visible to the employees so they can follow and trust me by telephone. Or hidden ;)
2008-07-14T16:51:00.000Z	TecR0c		Please let me know if you remember the name
2008-07-14T16:52:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	TecR0c	lemme look.. i can't promise that I find it again.. I'm out of that biz now.. working as programmer parttime
2008-07-14T16:52:00.000Z	TecR0c		I will def have a think about going vnc
2008-07-14T16:53:00.000Z	TecR0c		i know it is very good how you can control their sessions without having to log them out etc.
2008-07-14T16:53:00.000Z	TecR0c		Thanks.
2008-07-14T16:56:00.000Z	TecR0c		Which is the best vnc server for windows ?
