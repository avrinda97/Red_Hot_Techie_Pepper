2010-05-17T02:30:00.000Z	bindir		hmm
2010-05-17T02:30:00.000Z	bindir		is there a way to apt-get install kernel 2.6.32 for ubuntu 8.04 LTS?
2010-05-17T02:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bindir	Why do you want it? There  is probably also a ppa.
2010-05-17T02:31:00.000Z	bindir	sebsebseb	I'm thinking it might be a driver/kernel issue related to my NIC not working with 4gb mem support on in the bios
2010-05-17T02:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bindir	8.04 is getting quite old now really,  you can directly upgrade it to 10.04.  However no Ext4 file system or Grub 2 on upgrade, but you don't need those anyway.
2010-05-17T02:33:00.000Z	bindir	sebsebseb	zimbra doesn't support 10.04
2010-05-17T02:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bindir	What's zimbra?
2010-05-17T02:34:00.000Z	bindir	sebsebseb	zimbra is a mail/calendar (exchange replacement)
2010-05-17T02:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bindir	As far as I know Evolution has some support now for Exchange
2010-05-17T02:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bindir	also if you can install a program for 8.04, then you probably can for 10.04 as well
2010-05-17T02:35:00.000Z	bindir	sebsebseb	zimbra has a commerical version that doesn't support 10.04
2010-05-17T02:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bindir	yes it may say it doesn't run on 10.04, but it probably will
2010-05-17T02:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bindir	I'll have a look at the site
2010-05-17T02:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bindir	still here?
2010-05-17T02:40:00.000Z	bindir	sebsebseb	it's not a matter of it running or not on 10.04 it's if something goes wrong they can just say "oh we don't support 10.04"
2010-05-17T02:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bindir	I see
2010-05-17T02:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bindir	yeah
2010-05-17T02:41:00.000Z	bindir	sebsebseb	yea trying to see if google would know why 4gb memory mapping would break an ethernet card lol
2010-05-17T02:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bindir	so why do you want the later kernel exactly?
2010-05-17T02:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bindir	you want to use Zimbra at home or?
2010-05-17T02:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bindir	this might sound a bit sucky, but here's something you could do.  10.04 as the host operating system, with 8.04 in Virtualbox for Zimbra
2010-05-17T02:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bindir	anyway I guess a bit longer now, and Zimba will do a version for 10.04
