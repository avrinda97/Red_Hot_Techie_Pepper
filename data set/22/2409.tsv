2009-06-28T19:57:00.000Z	sasori2501		hello all.  can i roll back my kernel?
2009-06-28T19:57:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sasori2501	yes you can, just install the old version and then boot into it
2009-06-28T19:58:00.000Z	sasori2501	Mike_lifeguard	how do i  do that?? this is a critical matter, all the help would be MUCH appreciated
2009-06-28T19:58:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sasori2501	what kernel version do you want?
2009-06-28T19:59:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sasori2501	(and what are you using now?)
2009-06-28T19:59:00.000Z	sasori2501	Mike_lifeguard	the one before this one JUST released.  i am ubu 9.04 nbr.  it messed up mmy vbox badly
2009-06-28T20:00:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sasori2501	I don't know what version you mean by that... 2.6.30 was just released, so the version before that is 2.6.29, but that's not a jaunty kernel. Do you mean 2.6.13? That's the jaunty-proposed kernel, I think. Or maybe you mean 2.6.11, which is the stock jaunty kernel?
2009-06-28T20:01:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sasori2501	please show me uname -r
2009-06-28T20:02:00.000Z	sasori2501	Mike_lifeguard	it was a ubuntu 9.04 nbr install, and the putput is now uname -r
2009-06-28T20:02:00.000Z	sasori2501	Mike_lifeguard	i mean 2.6.28-13-generic
2009-06-28T20:04:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sasori2501	you should be able to install it like any other package in synaptic -- do you know how to choose what version of a package to install using synaptic?
2009-06-28T20:05:00.000Z	sasori2501	Mike_lifeguard	no, actually im not sure how to do that, sorry :(
2009-06-28T20:06:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sasori2501	ok, so open synaptic...
2009-06-28T20:06:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sasori2501	and find the package called 'linux-image-generic'
2009-06-28T20:08:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sasori2501	with me so far?
2009-06-28T20:08:00.000Z	sasori2501	Mike_lifeguard	actually, i cant get it to open... it just hangs... ARGH!  ok, well after i do that what should i do next??
2009-06-28T20:09:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sasori2501	then install and boot into that kernel
2009-06-28T20:17:00.000Z	sasori2501	Mike_lifeguard	i cant find it, all i get is a restricted modules come up with those numbers
2009-06-28T20:18:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sasori2501	you have to search by package name, not version -- searching for 'linux' will normally give you good results
2009-06-28T20:19:00.000Z	sasori2501	Mike_lifeguard	that search gave me no kernall results unfortunatley
2009-06-28T20:20:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sasori2501	try linux-image?
2009-06-28T20:22:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sasori2501	any luck finding the package?
