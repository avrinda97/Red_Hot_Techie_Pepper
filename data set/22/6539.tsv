2006-09-29T09:18:00.000Z	xopher		If I get this error when dpkg-builpackaginng: dpkg-gencontrol: error: must specify package since control info has many - what should I edit?
2006-09-29T09:18:00.000Z	segfault_	xopher	ur control file
2006-09-29T09:18:00.000Z	xopher	segfault_	what in it?
2006-09-29T09:19:00.000Z	segfault_	xopher	there are plenty of debian pkging resources on the net plz read up first
2006-09-29T09:19:00.000Z	xopher	segfault_	sure, I have, just wondered if someone would have had a quick answer
2006-09-29T09:20:00.000Z	segfault_	xopher	plz read if no luck come back and ill try to answer
2006-09-29T09:42:00.000Z	xopher	segfault_	could not find out what was causing this, my debian/control file is just as it should be.
2006-09-29T09:42:00.000Z	segfault_	xopher	paste in pastebin
2006-09-29T09:43:00.000Z	xopher	segfault_	sure, Ill need to recompile it first, to get the error again..
2006-09-29T10:02:00.000Z	xopher	segfault_	it actually compiles when I commented out the other package from the control file (bmpx-dev), any ideas what I should change to get them both compiled? dpkg-gencontrol: error: must specify package since control info has many. - Was the error..
2006-09-29T10:02:00.000Z	segfault_	xopher	paste ur control file in pastebin
2006-09-29T10:04:00.000Z	xopher	segfault_	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25179/
2006-09-29T10:07:00.000Z	segfault_	xopher	iirc u need only one package line for the bianry, u may need to create a sep pkg to create the -dev lib
2006-09-29T10:08:00.000Z	xopher	segfault_	well when I compile beryl-core, I get beryl beryl-core and beryl-dev, so it should be possible..
2006-09-29T10:16:00.000Z	segfault_	xopher	sry i wont be able to help with that, i would compare ur control file for this to that of beryl-core and see wat is different and try to eliminate the differences
2006-09-29T10:17:00.000Z	xopher	segfault_	just a sec then
2006-09-29T10:18:00.000Z	xopher	segfault_	here's the beryl-core one http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25182/
2006-09-29T10:20:00.000Z	segfault_	xopher	1st thing to try is the spacing, between the end of description and next package tag
2006-09-29T10:21:00.000Z	segfault_	xopher	the parser may distinguish pkgs based on spacing
2006-09-29T10:21:00.000Z	xopher	segfault_	ok, trying it now
2006-09-29T10:50:00.000Z	xopher	segfault_	thanks, it actually worked. the space was needed
2006-09-29T10:56:00.000Z	segfault_	xopher	np i recall the parser for the control file not being very intelligent
