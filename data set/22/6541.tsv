2006-09-26T16:44:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		wtf.
2006-09-26T16:44:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		oh phew.
2006-09-26T16:45:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		*sigh* Why is anything other than Windows so hard to install? :\
2006-09-26T16:46:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		About the only thing I liked about Vista...it installs pretty much without a glitch.
2006-09-26T16:46:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		Hell no! I installed OSX86, was a pain.
2006-09-26T16:46:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		Vista? You have a partition...fine, it'll do EVERYTHING else for you.
2006-09-26T16:47:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		I've been trying for an hour, and it keeps giving me errors after errors...thats the problem with installing Linux.
2006-09-26T16:47:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		Naw dude, you only get blue screens and the likes with old unsupported hardware.
2006-09-26T16:47:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		My laptop's beyond fully supported.
2006-09-26T16:47:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	WhiteDeth	what is the hardware you are trying to install on, and is there another operating system on it?
2006-09-26T16:48:00.000Z	WhiteDeth	fyrestrtr	Yep, Windows XP and Vista. It's a Dell Inspiron 9400.
2006-09-26T16:48:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	WhiteDeth	how big of a hard disk?
2006-09-26T16:48:00.000Z	WhiteDeth	fyrestrtr	100GB 7200RPM :)
2006-09-26T16:49:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	WhiteDeth	the problem with Vista (which I doubt you know) is that overtakes your mbr in such a way, that its a hassle to install anything else on it (even Windows -- unless you format the disk). So, for you, I suggest doing a manual partition, using the now-vacant free space of Vista.
2006-09-26T16:51:00.000Z	WhiteDeth	fyrestrtr	Thats what im planning to do. Using the vacant space now to install Ubuntu. It kept giving me errors earlier, im gonna try again now.
2006-09-26T16:53:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	WhiteDeth	the one called boot:
2006-09-26T16:54:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	WhiteDeth	if you bother to read that screen, it will tell you that if you press any key, the timer is disabled :)
2006-09-26T16:55:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	WhiteDeth	don't feel the trolls, please.
2006-09-26T16:57:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	WhiteDeth	its linux not Linux
2006-09-26T16:58:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	WhiteDeth	are you using the alternate cd?
2006-09-26T05:17:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	WhiteDeth	RedGhost take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
