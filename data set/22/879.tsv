2012-09-19T18:24:00.000Z	vinceableworld		Thanks for all the input guys/gals
2012-09-19T18:24:00.000Z	vinceableworld		How would you compare teamspeak to skype?
2012-09-19T18:24:00.000Z	vinceableworld		or mumble to skype?
2012-09-19T18:24:00.000Z	vinceableworld		besides the obvious (owned by microcrap)
2012-09-19T18:25:00.000Z	vinceableworld		Which means what exactly?
2012-09-19T18:25:00.000Z	vinceableworld		Well anything going thru a server isn't exactly all that secure?
2012-09-19T18:26:00.000Z	vinceableworld		ic...
2012-09-19T18:26:00.000Z	vinceableworld		comprehend.
2012-09-19T18:27:00.000Z	vinceableworld		okay so teamspeak is downloaded... just click on the file .run ?
2012-09-19T18:27:00.000Z	k1l	vinceableworld	ts 3 client?
2012-09-19T18:28:00.000Z	k1l	vinceableworld	make it executable. then run it
2012-09-19T18:29:00.000Z	k1l	vinceableworld	right click, then rights column and then check make executable
2012-09-19T18:30:00.000Z	k1l	vinceableworld	yep. i dont know what it is called exactly in english but that sounds good
2012-09-19T18:31:00.000Z	k1l	vinceableworld	then run it. the license viewer can be quitted with "q". after that you get a new folder. put it anywhere in your home folder
2012-09-19T18:33:00.000Z	k1l	vinceableworld	its installed when you got the new folder
2012-09-19T18:34:00.000Z	k1l	vinceableworld	start it with the ts3client_runsrcript.sh thing in the folder
2012-09-19T18:41:00.000Z	k1l	vinceableworld	teamspeak is like irc. you have to choose a server
2012-09-19T18:42:00.000Z	k1l	vinceableworld	there are millions of paid and free servers. so make a search
2012-09-19T18:44:00.000Z	k1l	vinceableworld	yes, you can install your own  ts server.
2012-09-19T18:45:00.000Z	k1l	vinceableworld	well. running a service on a server needs some basic knowledge. at least for security purposes.
2012-09-19T18:45:00.000Z	k1l	vinceableworld	i would suggest to use a free ts server. just go on the search for one
