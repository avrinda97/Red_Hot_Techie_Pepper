2010-07-16T06:21:00.000Z	Aiya		I set the visual effect at extra but when Check back its back to none.Why its happens?
2010-07-16T06:22:00.000Z	Cityscape	Aiya	something is stopping it from using extra. probably a bad graphics driver or too old graphics card.
2010-07-16T06:23:00.000Z	Cityscape	Aiya	how old is your computer?
2010-07-16T06:24:00.000Z	Aiya	Cityscape	How do I figure it out.My laptop is new and using NVIDIA grapic
2010-07-16T06:24:00.000Z	Cityscape	Aiya	you probably need a better driver.
2010-07-16T06:27:00.000Z	Cityscape	Aiya	go to System > Administration > Hardware drivers. does it recommend a driver there?
2010-07-16T06:27:00.000Z	Aiya	Cityscape	Is says recommand
2010-07-16T06:27:00.000Z	Aiya	Cityscape	yes
2010-07-16T06:27:00.000Z	Cityscape	Aiya	I don't know about your link there, doesn't look reliable.
2010-07-16T06:28:00.000Z	Aiya	Cityscape	that is the graphic driver in hardware driver when i enable it
2010-07-16T06:29:00.000Z	Aiya	Cityscape	I have enable it
2010-07-16T06:30:00.000Z	Cityscape	Aiya	Okay if everything looks good then close Hardware Drivers and then try setting it to high effects
2010-07-16T06:31:00.000Z	Cityscape	Aiya	reboot your computer first
2010-07-16T06:32:00.000Z	Cityscape	Aiya	reboot before
2010-07-16T06:33:00.000Z	Cityscape	Aiya	then after your computer restarts enable extra effects
2010-07-16T06:33:00.000Z	Aiya	Cityscape	Spanglish_7776: how do I restart the graphical server after activating the driver?
2010-07-16T06:33:00.000Z	Cityscape	Aiya	if you reboot it will restart the graphical server.
2010-07-16T06:43:00.000Z	Cityscape	Aiya	so it still won't stay on extra?
2010-07-16T06:43:00.000Z	Aiya	Cityscape	yes.Its wont stay
