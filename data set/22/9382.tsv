2004-11-20T11:27:00.000Z	icu		Has anyone tried running unreal 2004 with an ati card and fglrx?
2004-11-20T11:29:00.000Z	icu		how can I setup the kernel dri module for my radeon mobility 9000 card?
2004-11-20T10:24:00.000Z	icu		When might the new version of ati's fglrx drivers be available?
2004-11-20T10:26:00.000Z	gwildor_	icu	the default with ubuntu gives me 4k fps
2004-11-20T10:26:00.000Z	gwildor_	icu	radeon 7000 64mb
2004-11-20T10:28:00.000Z	gwildor_	icu	oh yeah, I had to comment out a line in xfree86-4, or whatever
2004-11-20T10:28:00.000Z	icu	gwildor_	Can you find that line, thanks a lot, I tried getting it to work before without any luck.
2004-11-20T10:29:00.000Z	gwildor_	icu	paste me that file, ill tell you
2004-11-20T10:29:00.000Z	gwildor_	icu	atleast what I had to do
2004-11-20T10:29:00.000Z	gwildor_	icu	kk
2004-11-20T11:10:00.000Z	icu	gwildor_	Hi, i'm back. I gave those settings a try and yes dri is working except it's a lot slower than with the fglrx drivers and more problematic.
2004-11-20T11:12:00.000Z	icu	gwildor_	Have you tried tweaking your settings at all the improve performance?
2004-11-20T11:12:00.000Z	gwildor_	icu	for what?
2004-11-20T11:13:00.000Z	icu	gwildor_	To improve 3d performance
2004-11-20T11:14:00.000Z	gwildor_	icu	all I did was comment out a line and change stuff that said generic to radeon
2004-11-20T11:16:00.000Z	icu	gwildor_	Oh ok, thanks anyways, I think i'll go back to the fglrx drivers as the frame rates are easily double that of the dri drivers.
2004-11-20T11:16:00.000Z	gwildor_	icu	what are you getting?
2004-11-20T11:17:00.000Z	gwildor_	icu	why so low, I get 4000+
2004-11-20T11:18:00.000Z	icu	gwildor_	What kind of card is that?
2004-11-20T11:18:00.000Z	gwildor_	icu	radeon 7000 64mb agp
2004-11-20T11:18:00.000Z	gwildor_	icu	1.2ghz 256 ram
2004-11-20T11:19:00.000Z	icu	gwildor_	This is radeon mobility 9000 32mb so I don't know. Hmm, I gotta believe I should be getting higher. I've got a centrino 1.3, 640mb ram.
