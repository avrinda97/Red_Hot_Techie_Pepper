2006-01-04T06:25:00.000Z	mwe	Draken	sounds broken. is the user in the admin group?
2006-01-04T06:26:00.000Z	Draken	mwe	i cant check, because only a admin can
2006-01-04T06:26:00.000Z	mwe	Draken	no type groups as your own user in a terminal and it will show you what groups you're in
2006-01-04T06:26:00.000Z	mwe	Draken	the user created in the installer should be in the admin group if you didn't change it
2006-01-04T12:41:00.000Z	mwe	Draken	what pppd error?
2006-01-04T12:44:00.000Z	Draken	mwe	it says PPPD daemon has died
2006-01-04T12:45:00.000Z	mwe	Draken	yeah. you gotta look in the log files /var/log for more info about why it died
