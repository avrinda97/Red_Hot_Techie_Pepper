2007-12-15T08:37:00.000Z	limpc		hey.
2007-12-15T08:38:00.000Z	limpc		does the desktop edition have all the software available to install, as the server edition?
2007-12-15T08:38:00.000Z	svladcjelli	limpc	yes
2007-12-15T08:38:00.000Z	limpc	svladcjelli	  - hmm, why are there 2 versions of ubuntu then?
2007-12-15T08:39:00.000Z	svladcjelli	limpc	for package selections among other things, it is well explained on web site
2007-12-15T08:39:00.000Z	limpc	svladcjelli	  - not really
2007-12-15T08:40:00.000Z	limpc	svladcjelli	 it just says "more info" for the server and desktop editions which gives a generic go-over.. but doesnt say explicitly what the difference is or provide any sort of comparsion chart
2007-12-15T08:40:00.000Z	svladcjelli	limpc	they are the same, one has a gui one does not, to put it simply
2007-12-15T08:40:00.000Z	limpc	svladcjelli	 hmm okay. thanks
2007-12-15T08:41:00.000Z	limpc		is there any reason i shouldnt get the 64 bit version?
2007-12-15T08:41:00.000Z	limpc		I have a dual-core AMD64.
2007-12-15T08:42:00.000Z	limpc		ive heard horror stories about having to recompile stuff to work with 64 bit..
2007-12-15T08:42:00.000Z	svladcjelli		64bit edition works fine
2007-12-15T08:42:00.000Z	svladcjelli		you can do anything on 64 you can on 32, and ubuntu makes it easy
2007-12-15T08:42:00.000Z	limpc		i write software.. do realtime video encoding
2007-12-15T08:43:00.000Z	limpc		hmm okay..
2007-12-15T08:43:00.000Z	svladcjelli		you can run any 32bit app
2007-12-15T08:43:00.000Z	svladcjelli		so anything
2007-12-15T08:43:00.000Z	svladcjelli		uh do any of you run 64bit? :)
2007-12-15T08:43:00.000Z	svladcjelli		i have been for years
2007-12-15T08:43:00.000Z	limpc		is there any performance degradation when running 32 bit on 64? I'm assuming some emulation would be going on
2007-12-15T08:44:00.000Z	svladcjelli	limpc	no
