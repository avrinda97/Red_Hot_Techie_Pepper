2005-02-23T13:25:00.000Z	Neil3		once i ditched esd it was just bad
2005-02-23T13:26:00.000Z	Neil3		but i use totem-xine for everything
2005-02-23T13:26:00.000Z	Neil3		it just seems gstreamer stuff has trouble for me
2005-02-23T13:26:00.000Z	Neil3		maybe my cruddy sound card
2005-02-23T13:27:00.000Z	Neil3		i got lm_sensors working too today :)
2005-02-23T13:28:00.000Z	Neil3		ubuntu feels a lot faster than fedora on my system, now i'm thinking, would gentoo be even quicker?
2005-02-23T13:29:00.000Z	Neil3		so it wouldnt give a performance boost?
2005-02-23T13:29:00.000Z	Neil3		i did a bunch of tweaking here
2005-02-23T13:30:00.000Z	Neil3		hdparm, k7 kernel etc
2005-02-23T13:30:00.000Z	Neil3		and prelink works well with ubuntu so far
2005-02-23T13:30:00.000Z	andrewski	Neil3	what's prelink?
2005-02-23T13:31:00.000Z	andrewski	Neil3	memory-intensive?
2005-02-23T13:31:00.000Z	andrewski	Neil3	wow, is there doc for setting it up?
2005-02-23T13:32:00.000Z	andrewski	Neil3	ok, i'll check it out.
2005-02-23T13:32:00.000Z	andrewski	Neil3	that'd be great.
2005-02-23T13:35:00.000Z	andrewski	Neil3	and it just runs once (per day)?
2005-02-23T13:36:00.000Z	andrewski	Neil3	wow.
2005-02-23T13:38:00.000Z	andrewski	Neil3	i actually noticed slower performance in drawing windows (when closing, etc.) and with librsvg...
2005-02-23T13:40:00.000Z	Neil3	andrewski	is librsvg to do with prelinking?
2005-02-23T13:41:00.000Z	andrewski	Neil3	dunno.  i never messed with prelinking in gentoo, if that means anything.
2005-02-23T13:42:00.000Z	andrewski	Neil3	yes, and thusly draws any .svg files i use (icon themes, desktop backgrounds)... but more slowly in ubuntu than in gentoo, for me anyway.
2005-02-23T13:43:00.000Z	andrewski	Neil3	alternatives to librsvg?
