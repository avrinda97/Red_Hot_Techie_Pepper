2007-06-27T07:28:00.000Z	gatman		hello guys
2007-06-27T07:28:00.000Z	gatman		I need some advice (not a technicall questioN)
2007-06-27T07:29:00.000Z	gatman		what is the main differnece between ubuntu server edition and desktop edition?
2007-06-27T07:29:00.000Z	kitche	gatman	one installs cli and kernel is server based and the other is gui and desktop geared
2007-06-27T07:30:00.000Z	gatman	kitche	so the server edition has no gui, x, what so ever?
2007-06-27T07:30:00.000Z	gatman		because the truth is, I wanna have a server, but at the same time, use the distro as a desktop OS.
2007-06-27T07:31:00.000Z	gatman		the server edition comes with LAMP, so I dunno...
2007-06-27T07:31:00.000Z	gatman		kitche...
2007-06-27T07:32:00.000Z	gatman		why isn't anyone talking to me :( ?
2007-06-27T07:33:00.000Z	gatman		should I go to another channel?
2007-06-27T07:33:00.000Z	gatman		ok..
2007-06-27T07:33:00.000Z	gatman		it's a bit crowded, can I msg you?
2007-06-27T07:34:00.000Z	kitche	gatman	install the desktop edition and install the server stuff that you want
2007-06-27T07:34:00.000Z	gatman	kitche	I find that a pain, can't I do the opposite?
2007-06-27T07:34:00.000Z	kitche	gatman	yes
2007-06-27T07:35:00.000Z	gatman	kitche	server edition comes prepaired with LAMP, but is the desktop utilties scarce?
2007-06-27T07:35:00.000Z	gatman		s/is/are/
2007-06-27T07:35:00.000Z	kitche	gatman	they use the same repos so you can get a desktop real easy
2007-06-27T07:35:00.000Z	gatman	kitche	agian, does it come with X?
2007-06-27T07:36:00.000Z	kitche	gatman	server does not
2007-06-27T07:36:00.000Z	kitche	gatman	but you can install it with ubuntu-desktop package
2007-06-27T07:36:00.000Z	gatman	kitche	damn...
