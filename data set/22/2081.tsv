2009-10-03T11:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Wolfenstein	 i often find it easier to just put winscp on the windows box . and access ubuntu via ssh  that way
2009-10-03T11:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Wolfenstein	  you did install 'samba' package? and gave the user a samba password with 'sudo smbpasswd -a USERNAME' ?
2009-10-03T11:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Wolfenstein	 im just going through what i normally do to get things going on a new system. :)
2009-10-03T11:34:00.000Z	Wolfenstein	Dr_Willis	the problems are in a windows computer not ubuntu i haven't changed anything to my ubuntu computer
2009-10-03T11:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Wolfenstein	 ahh.  i also always have identicval windows user name and password on the windows box.  Can the windows box access its own shares?
2009-10-03T11:36:00.000Z	Wolfenstein	Dr_Willis	what? im not sharing files through same computer if thats what you're asking i have 2 computers one is windows and one is nix, os ubuntu which is what im on now
2009-10-03T11:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Wolfenstein	 as a 'test'  i always make a share on both machines. and make sure they can access theor own local shares.
2009-10-03T11:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Wolfenstein	 also instead of //HOSTnAME/share  you could try the ip#.
2009-10-03T11:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Wolfenstein	 im just thinking through things ive done in the past to trouble shoot samba.
2009-10-03T11:38:00.000Z	Wolfenstein	Dr_Willis	i have my config for samba set with computername and i did that in windows its telling me it can't find it
2009-10-03T11:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Wolfenstein	 can the windows box even ping the lin box via  the name?  can it ping via ip?
2009-10-03T11:39:00.000Z	Wolfenstein	Dr_Willis	i never had a problem before like i said i just reformatting the windows computer and got it all squared up so i shouldn't have a problem
2009-10-03T11:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Wolfenstein	 im just spitting out trouble shooting 'things to try' to narrow down the problem.
2009-10-03T11:40:00.000Z	Wolfenstein	Dr_Willis	no problem but i don't know what is the problem since i never did anything on the ubuntu side but remove xchat and the xchat folder
2009-10-03T11:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Wolfenstein	 also see if the lin box can access a share on the windows box. (ie the reverse of what you want to do).  If that also fails. that may be a sign of network/firewall/windows setting issues also.
2009-10-03T11:42:00.000Z	Wolfenstein	Dr_Willis	i can now access my windows files through ubuntu as i couldn't before but was able to access my ubuntu files in windows now its backwards if only i can get windows problem solved
2009-10-03T11:46:00.000Z	Wolfenstein	Dr_Willis	i got a question do you know how i can set the program files folder in windows to share? the boxes are greyed out and i dunno how to make it to where i can access that on my ubuntu computer
2009-10-03T11:51:00.000Z	Wolfenstein	Dr_Willis	or firecrotch are you two still around?
2009-10-03T11:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Wolfenstein	 im in and out.. :)
2009-10-03T11:53:00.000Z	Wolfenstein	Dr_Willis	did you get any of my recent posts
2009-10-03T11:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Wolfenstein	 yea. Ping works via name and ip. Thats a good sign.  There should be some samba logs in /var/log somewhere.  You could tail -f, the log,  and try to connect via windows and see if the connection is rejected/tried/shown at all.
2009-10-03T11:56:00.000Z	Wolfenstein	Dr_Willis	i have no problem now connecting to the windows sharing part i did before but firecrotch told me what i might have done which i turned off and now im able to connect to windows sharing folders
