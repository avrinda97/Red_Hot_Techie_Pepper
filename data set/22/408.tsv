2012-09-17T20:31:00.000Z	Archae		I suppose what I'm asking is whether many linux/ubuntu applications have windows ports or whether there's a wine-esque program for windows that does the same thing but for linux libraries
2012-09-17T20:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Archae	depends on the app and the devs, you can always port it yourself, the source code is freely available
2012-09-17T20:33:00.000Z	Archae	ActionParsnip	if all porting refers to is compiling it myself and having it work then, then yeah, that'd be cake
2012-09-17T20:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Archae	what do you want to achieve and we may be able to suggest apps
2012-09-17T20:35:00.000Z	Archae	ActionParsnip	I suppose the end goal is to have >75% of the included ubuntu applications installed on windows7
2012-09-17T20:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Archae	what do you want the apps to achieve?
2012-09-17T20:37:00.000Z	Archae	ActionParsnip	I don't really know what you mean or how to answer that; the idea is emulating the feel of ubuntu
2012-09-17T20:40:00.000Z	Archae	ActionParsnip	fidel: http://i.imgur.com/o0nu9.jpg   I've emulated the desktop decently enough for my satisfaction; now i'm just looking for typical/default ubuntu programs (open-source) to install
2012-09-17T20:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Archae	haha class
2012-09-17T20:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Archae	Firefox, VLC, Thunderbird, Pidgin, DeVeDe, Libre/OpenOffice, Spotify, Gimp all have Windows ports (Just a list I thought of quickly)
2012-09-17T20:44:00.000Z	Archae	ActionParsnip	thanks for that :D
2012-09-17T20:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Archae	depends what you need the app to do.
2012-09-17T20:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Archae	there is a tweak app for Windows to put the Close, Min, Max buttons on the left too if you want
2012-09-17T20:45:00.000Z	Archae	ActionParsnip	They're on the left in Ubuntu? o_O (been a while)
2012-09-17T20:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Archae	could use powershell :)
2012-09-17T20:48:00.000Z	Archae	ActionParsnip	</3 powershell
2012-09-17T20:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Archae	oh dude it does a lot if you can use it
2012-09-17T20:48:00.000Z	Archae	ActionParsnip	yeah, but it feels obtuse
2012-09-17T20:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Archae	how so?
2012-09-17T20:50:00.000Z	Archae	ActionParsnip	gotta go for now, changing classes ;D
2012-09-18T02:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Archae	work is quiet :)
2012-09-18T02:40:00.000Z	Archae	ActionParsnip	just fyi, busy fooling with the win7 login screen to make it more ubunteque :D
