2009-03-22T11:13:00.000Z	ksbalaji		onglive ubuntu. is there any 9.xx LTS?  I use 8.04 Hardy LTS
2009-03-22T11:15:00.000Z	lstarnes	ksbalaji	4th month of 2010
2009-03-22T11:15:00.000Z	lstarnes	ksbalaji	so probably around mid-April 2010
2009-03-22T11:16:00.000Z	ksbalaji	lstarnes	,Flannel that is good info. I would not upgrade from 8.04 till then. I would happly update till then.
2009-03-22T11:17:00.000Z	lstarnes	ksbalaji	usually non-LTS releases work well after being out for a couple months
2009-03-22T11:21:00.000Z	lstarnes	ksbalaji	the non-LTS releases still get regular updates, although only for 18 months
2009-03-22T11:21:00.000Z	ksbalaji	lstarnes	thanks. for the 18 months info.
2009-08-23T16:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	ksbalaji	in which client?
2009-08-23T16:19:00.000Z	ksbalaji	lstarnes	xchat
2009-08-23T16:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	ksbalaji	you could try disabling joins/parts/quits
2009-08-23T16:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	ksbalaji	right-clock on the channel tab and uncheck the "show joins/quits" option
2009-08-23T16:19:00.000Z	ksbalaji	lstarnes	how to?
2009-08-23T16:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	ksbalaji	note that this does ALL joins and quits
2009-08-23T16:20:00.000Z	lstarnes	ksbalaji	not just ones associated with netsplits
2009-08-23T16:20:00.000Z	lstarnes	ksbalaji	I would strongly recommend keeping them enabled
2009-08-23T16:21:00.000Z	lstarnes	ksbalaji	especially when someone who you are talking to suddenly quits without you knowing
2009-08-23T16:21:00.000Z	ksbalaji	lstarnes	aah! now this is better. thanks. I can not take them any more.
2009-08-23T16:21:00.000Z	lstarnes	ksbalaji	floods of joins/quits don't happen very often
2009-08-23T16:22:00.000Z	ksbalaji	lstarnes	I understand. But when I saw one, It heated up my nerves. I find this convenient.
2009-08-23T16:23:00.000Z	lstarnes	ksbalaji	I find disabling the messages to cause confusion
2009-08-23T16:24:00.000Z	ksbalaji	lstarnes	yes. I find reason in your words. Anyway thanks for solving my immediate problem!
