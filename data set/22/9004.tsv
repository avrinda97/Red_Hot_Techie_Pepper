2005-04-06T13:54:00.000Z	Roey		hi
2005-04-06T13:54:00.000Z	Roey		I get this when I try to compile the modules:
2005-04-06T13:54:00.000Z	Roey		*** WARNING:
2005-04-06T13:54:00.000Z	Roey		*** Unable to compile wacom.o without kernel build environment
2005-04-06T13:54:00.000Z	Roey		*** wacom.o will not be built
2005-04-06T13:54:00.000Z	Roey		what is that all about???
2005-04-06T13:55:00.000Z	Bazzi	Roey	do you have the kernel build environment?
2005-04-06T13:56:00.000Z	Roey	Bazzi	 I thought so! I just compiled it a while ago... I rebooted, tried to compile again and now I get this!
2005-04-06T13:56:00.000Z	Roey	Bazzi	 i just had this compiling before I rebooted!
2005-04-06T13:57:00.000Z	Roey	Bazzi	 the thing is that nothing in that kernel module source is being built!
2005-04-06T13:58:00.000Z	Roey	Bazzi	 remove and reinstall the kernel headers you mean?
2005-04-06T13:58:00.000Z	Roey	Bazzi	 what's the package name do you know?
2005-04-08T11:54:00.000Z	Bazzi	Roey	why not using $script_language
2005-04-08T11:54:00.000Z	Roey	Bazzi	 because sometimes you want to bang out one-liners
2005-04-08T11:54:00.000Z	Roey	Bazzi	 does gnome even have an IPC mechanism?
2005-04-08T11:54:00.000Z	Roey	Bazzi	 that's stable and integrated?
2005-04-08T11:55:00.000Z	Roey	Bazzi	 what I'm getting at is, is there anything like dcop but for gnome?
2005-04-08T11:56:00.000Z	Roey	Bazzi	 well dcop just makes it possibel to manipulate interfaces that apps "publish"
2005-04-08T11:59:00.000Z	Bazzi	Roey	looks like you want kubuntu hehehe
2005-04-08T12:01:00.000Z	Roey	Bazzi	 I installed kubuntu (well basically ubunut + kubuntu kde packages)
2005-04-08T12:01:00.000Z	Roey	Bazzi	 I'm freaking out.. it's been two weeks and I have all these problems with it in general
2005-04-08T12:01:00.000Z	Roey	Bazzi	 lilo won't boot my amd64 kernels
