2012-02-02T12:45:00.000Z	JermBob		how can i remove the mail icon from the tool bar in ubuntu 11.10 ?
2012-02-02T12:46:00.000Z	bc81	JermBob	i'm not sure if it's the same in 11.10, but in 10.10 it was sudo apt-get remove indicator-messages && killall gnome-panel
2012-02-02T12:47:00.000Z	JermBob		ill try
2012-02-02T12:49:00.000Z	JermBob	bc81	what is the && killall gnome-panel going to do ?
2012-02-02T12:49:00.000Z	JermBob		i understand the rest
2012-02-02T12:49:00.000Z	bc81	JermBob	that will restart the panel
2012-02-02T12:50:00.000Z	JermBob		is that what && does ?
2012-02-02T12:50:00.000Z	bc81	JermBob	that is, if 11.04 even usues the panel anymore
2012-02-02T12:50:00.000Z	JermBob		ah cool
2012-02-02T12:50:00.000Z	JermBob		learning :D
2012-02-02T12:51:00.000Z	JermBob		so gnome-panel: no process found
2012-02-02T12:51:00.000Z	JermBob		otherwise it removed the indicator-messages
2012-02-02T12:51:00.000Z	JermBob		thats cool
2012-02-02T12:52:00.000Z	JermBob		ill just reboot
2012-02-02T12:52:00.000Z	bc81	JermBob	it might be that gnome-panel is not used in 11.04 (i don't know this)
2012-02-02T12:52:00.000Z	bc81	JermBob	log out/in should suffice
2012-02-02T12:52:00.000Z	JermBob	bc81	thanks and yeah looks like the -panel is missing. i rebooted before i got that last msg
2012-02-02T12:52:00.000Z	JermBob		all is good tho
