2012-03-12T20:22:00.000Z	q0s		i am running a harddrive check atm and during this my system is / partition gets full because /var/www/messages|kern.log|syslog is about 30gb. is there a way to disable logging?
2012-03-12T20:24:00.000Z	pfifo	q0s	delete the logfile, most programs that create logs, only append to existing files, and if the file doesnt exist, then logging = disabled. Im 90% sure klog operates like this
2012-03-12T20:27:00.000Z	q0s	pfifo	i did via console and "rm". but i recreated them and set the proper permissions. the wired thing is that "df" shows that there is still no free space. and i am sure i delete the right files ;) "baobab" clearly showed it
2012-03-12T20:27:00.000Z	pfifo	q0s	are you out of inodes? `df -i`
2012-03-12T20:28:00.000Z	q0s	pfifo	/dev/sda6            3276800  433327 2843473   14% /
2012-03-12T20:29:00.000Z	pfifo	q0s	then something is using your diskspace, du program can be used to find out what is taking up so much space
2012-03-12T20:32:00.000Z	q0s	pfifo	yeah. but i am using the gui application "baobob". its default in ubuntu and it showed me the huge 3 log files before. the wired thing is that baobob shows that there should be plenty of space but df shows its full. and the system feels as it is full. firefox is a pain currently. all at slowmotion. but the cpu is only at 20%
2012-03-12T20:33:00.000Z	pfifo	q0s	I dont trus baobob, use du please
2012-03-12T20:33:00.000Z	q0s	pfifo	ok. mom
2012-03-12T20:40:00.000Z	q0s	pfifo	how do i limit the output to just show the files over ... lets say ... 1gb?
2012-03-12T20:41:00.000Z	pfifo	q0s	use sort to list by size, something like this du -chs * | sort -n
2012-03-12T20:43:00.000Z	pfifo	q0s	actually to revers sort by size this is ideal du -cs * | sort -nr

2012-03-12T20:52:00.000Z	pfifo	q0s	run a filesystem check
2012-03-12T20:54:00.000Z	q0s	pfifo	i am doing this with another drive, which imho makes the logs go crazy and using up all space. besides this, its about my / partition. i need to umount it check the fs, right?
2012-03-12T20:55:00.000Z	pfifo	q0s	yes, you cant check a mounted filesystem, you can `sudo touch /forcefsck` and reboot
2012-03-12T20:59:00.000Z	q0s	pfifo	thanks. can i abort an filesystem check when its currently searching for bad blocks?
2012-03-12T20:59:00.000Z	pfifo	q0s	are you doing a filesystem check on / now?
2012-03-12T21:00:00.000Z	q0s	pfifo	no. another drive. no system partition... an old storage drive.
2012-03-12T21:01:00.000Z	pfifo	q0s	yes you can cancel it
2012-03-12T21:02:00.000Z	q0s	pfifo	dmesg | tail works. there is always a fresh output about drive errors of the drive i am currently checking. where does this data come from? i mean it has to be read somewhere
2012-03-12T21:03:00.000Z	pfifo	q0s	the data dmesg outputs is generated by the kernel using the function printk()
