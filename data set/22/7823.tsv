2006-01-19T12:57:00.000Z	Nightwind		I have a disk you cannot istall from it due to the BIOS
2006-01-19T12:57:00.000Z	Nightwind		I have about 200 floppys LOL
2006-01-19T12:58:00.000Z	Nightwind		gnome no it doesn't
2006-01-19T12:58:00.000Z	Nightwind		we've not been able to make a floppy that will boot it to where we can access the CD
2006-01-19T12:58:00.000Z	mwe	Nightwind	get another 200 and you can store the contents of a complete cd on them
2006-01-19T12:59:00.000Z	Nightwind	mwe	ok I can do that so how would I do it?
2006-01-19T12:59:00.000Z	mwe	Nightwind	I don't know. but you'd have the floppy space to do it
2006-01-19T13:01:00.000Z	mwe	Nightwind	I don't think you can. not that I know of at least
2006-01-19T13:02:00.000Z	Nightwind	mwe	I have the time and the need
2006-01-19T13:03:00.000Z	mwe	Nightwind	I have no idea how to do it if it can in fact be done
2006-01-19T13:05:00.000Z	mwe	Nightwind	couldn't you just somehow mount the iso file from the hdd?
2006-01-19T13:06:00.000Z	Nightwind	mwe	and ompaull, no there is no way as it has 8 SCSI drives and the BIOS doesn't support booting from the SCSI CD rom
2006-01-19T13:06:00.000Z	mwe	Nightwind	I asked if you could mount the iso file somehow. not the cd
2006-01-19T13:06:00.000Z	Nightwind	mwe	not I cannot
2006-01-19T13:07:00.000Z	mwe	Nightwind	why not?
2006-01-19T13:07:00.000Z	mwe	Nightwind	and why wont SBM work?
2006-01-19T13:08:00.000Z	mwe	Nightwind	yes if you can boot linux floppies
2006-01-19T13:09:00.000Z	mwe	Nightwind	you can get basic linux floppy sets on a few floppies
2006-01-19T13:09:00.000Z	mwe	Nightwind	then you'd be able to mount the iso file from the hdd
2006-01-19T13:10:00.000Z	Nightwind	mwe	I was wondering about that  but I am not sure exactly what issues if any I will have that way but I guess I can try
2006-01-19T13:10:00.000Z	mwe	Nightwind	yeah
2006-01-19T13:11:00.000Z	mwe	Nightwind	not really. I used one like 5 years ago or so but I forgot which by now
