2007-04-28T09:46:00.000Z	chamunks		is there a network mount that ubuntu will treat like a local file?
2007-04-28T09:46:00.000Z	eck	chamunks	also samba (and fuse things)
2007-04-28T09:51:00.000Z	eck	chamunks	nfs is actually really easy
2007-04-28T09:51:00.000Z	eck	chamunks	you install nfs-kernel-server, add the entries to /etc/exports and then start portmap on the client and mount it. that's basically it
2007-04-28T09:52:00.000Z	eck	chamunks	if you want to try out nfs it takes < 5 minutes to set it up
2007-04-28T09:52:00.000Z	chamunks	eck	ok ill give that a try thanks!
2007-04-28T09:55:00.000Z	chamunks	eck	so on the client i would want to install nfs-kernel-client?
2007-04-28T09:55:00.000Z	eck	chamunks	i think you just need portmap (which i believe is installed by default)
2007-04-28T09:56:00.000Z	chamunks	eck	k thx
2007-04-28T09:56:00.000Z	eck	chamunks	oh, i guess there's an nfs-client package
2007-04-28T09:57:00.000Z	chamunks	eck	should i install that or is it totally unnecessary?
2007-04-28T09:57:00.000Z	eck	chamunks	just grab it, it's a virtual package so it will install whatever you need
2007-04-28T09:58:00.000Z	chamunks	eck	ponders... whats the name of the nfs-client package?
2007-04-28T09:58:00.000Z	eck	chamunks	that is the name of it
2007-04-28T09:59:00.000Z	chamunks	eck	ok hmm maybe im doing something wrong brb
2007-04-28T09:59:00.000Z	eck	chamunks	it looks like it has packages to do uid mapping and what not, which isn't strictly necessary (but you might want it anyway)
2007-04-28T10:01:00.000Z	chamunks	eck	ok that sounds good ill check it out n get ya back if i have any more issues
2007-04-28T10:01:00.000Z	eck	chamunks	sure, there are also about 1000 howtos on setting up nfs
2007-04-28T10:02:00.000Z	chamunks	eck	ok thats kewl ill probably need some more specific stuff since what im doing seemes rather undocumented but im sure its done often enough
2007-04-28T10:05:00.000Z	chamunks	eck	what other packages do you figure would be really beneficial
2007-04-28T10:05:00.000Z	eck	chamunks	beneficial for what?
2007-04-28T10:10:00.000Z	chamunks	eck	i guess i dont know what im talking about yet but thanks you saved quite a bit of googleing with just referring me to those packages
