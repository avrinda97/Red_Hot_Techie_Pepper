2005-10-29T08:11:00.000Z	dorto	jowi	copy what files to the cd?
2005-10-29T08:11:00.000Z	jowi	dorto	the files you want to install on the PC of course. you can also add the CD to /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-10-29T08:12:00.000Z	dorto	jowi	where to download additional cd images from?
2005-10-29T08:13:00.000Z	jowi	dorto	breezy install cd can be obtained from www.ubuntu.com

2005-10-29T08:14:00.000Z	jowi	dorto	check that out
2005-10-29T08:14:00.000Z	dorto	jowi	don't i need a fast internet connection to install packages from there?
2005-10-29T08:15:00.000Z	jowi	dorto	nope, you can download manually from the repos own sites.
2005-10-29T08:15:00.000Z	dorto	jowi	what is the procedure to download?
2005-10-29T08:15:00.000Z	jowi	dorto	just choose from the specific sites what you want and burn them on a cd.
2005-10-29T08:15:00.000Z	jowi	dorto	what do you mean?
2005-10-29T08:16:00.000Z	dorto	jowi	i need to to right-click and save each individual file?
2005-10-29T08:16:00.000Z	jowi	dorto	yeah, that is the manual way
2005-10-29T08:16:00.000Z	dorto	jowi	isn't there an image file or something like that?
2005-10-29T08:16:00.000Z	dorto	jowi	.iso files or 700MB-800MB files?
2005-10-29T08:17:00.000Z	jowi	dorto	you just said you did not want an image. i don't know if it exist for the repos. you must check the individual sites yourself.
2005-10-29T08:18:00.000Z	jowi	dorto	you must check yourself. i do not know since i never needed to do that.
2005-10-29T08:19:00.000Z	jowi	dorto	they usually set up a fileserver that the individual computers fetch the files from
2005-10-29T08:19:00.000Z	jowi	dorto	the packages from the install-cd and some other downloaded packages probably. maybe the wiki's got what you are looking for.
