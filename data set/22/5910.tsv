2007-01-26T08:53:00.000Z	chiarato		how do I know whether I have Ubuntu Edgy 64 bit or 32 bit???
2007-01-26T08:53:00.000Z	shatrat	chiarato	type "uname -r" in console
2007-01-26T08:55:00.000Z	chiarato	shatrat	this is what I got?? 2.6.17-10-generic
2007-01-26T08:55:00.000Z	chiarato	shatrat	where does it say 32 or 64?
2007-01-26T08:55:00.000Z	shatrat	chiarato	I believe generic is 386
2007-01-26T08:56:00.000Z	chiarato	shatrat	sorry I'm new at this which means??
2007-01-26T08:56:00.000Z	shatrat	chiarato	ah sorry, 386 is 32, amd386_64 would be 64
2007-01-26T08:58:00.000Z	chiarato	shatrat	ok so my is a 32 right!! I was trying to install xgl with beryl but I keep getting E:  Couldn't find package beryl???
2007-01-26T08:59:00.000Z	shatrat	chiarato	You need to add a repository for Beryl.  Look for the beryl on edgy how-to at doc.gwos.org
2007-01-26T08:59:00.000Z	shatrat	chiarato	and like bruenig said, #ubuntu-xgl is a channel just for xgl, aiglx, beryl, compiz, et cetera
2007-01-28T06:53:00.000Z	shatrat	chiarato	you could add it to your boot script...but I think network-manager-gnome will do it automatically
2007-01-28T06:54:00.000Z	chiarato	shatrat	how would I do that?
2007-01-28T06:54:00.000Z	shatrat	chiarato	well, I installed network-manager-gnome on my laptop and it connects every time I start the laptop up.  Your mileagle may vary
2007-01-28T06:55:00.000Z	chiarato	shatrat	where do I get network-manager-gnome?
2007-01-28T06:56:00.000Z	shatrat	chiarato	I can't remember for sure what repository it is in.  It is probably listed in synaptic, you may have to enable universe or multiverse repositores
2007-01-28T06:58:00.000Z	chiarato	shatrat	after you installed it where do you run it?
2007-01-28T06:59:00.000Z	shatrat	chiarato	you can run it in Sessions/Startup Programs if it works, try it out in terminal first "network-manager-gnome"
2007-01-28T07:02:00.000Z	chiarato	shatrat	after I open the terminal what is the command to open network-manager-gnome?
2007-01-28T07:02:00.000Z	shatrat	chiarato	that's it, It hink
2007-01-28T07:02:00.000Z	shatrat	chiarato	I dont have my laptop with me or Id check.
2007-01-28T07:03:00.000Z	chiarato	shatrat	thanks man, I tried that I know it's installed but network-manager-gnome didn't do anything on the terminal!
2007-01-28T07:04:00.000Z	shatrat	chiarato	try network<tab> to autocomplete
