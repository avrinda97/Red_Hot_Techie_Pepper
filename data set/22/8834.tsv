2005-12-16T12:33:00.000Z	cmd		anybody here good with NFS? I think I got the server up and running on one PC *but* I think I do not know fully how to set up the client on another... Any body can help?
2005-12-16T12:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cmd	 should be several nfs tutorials out there.. ya just add the right entry to your /etc/fstab basicially
2005-12-16T12:35:00.000Z	cmd	Dr_Willis	thank you, but I think I am still lost in setting up the client for NFS
2005-12-16T12:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cmd	 checked  http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/NFS-HOWTO.html  yet?
2005-12-16T12:39:00.000Z	cmd	Dr_Willis	I am on the Ubuntu wiki now... thank you bro, just setting up the server and editing, allow, deny, host was I think easy... just getting the client right is my task at hand :)
2005-12-16T12:39:00.000Z	cmd	Dr_Willis	thank you for your help!
2005-12-16T12:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cmd	 yea. i need to do the same thing.. last i did it - i think it only took me a few min.. of course im using samba for a similer task for my users. (they just have to know what machine to get their stuff from)
2005-12-16T12:41:00.000Z	cmd	Dr_Willis	I am trying to share my home directory from one pc to another... I am trying to get on the other and login to my account as if I were sitting directly in front of the other...
2005-12-16T12:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cmd	 you do realize you can sort of 'login' to a remote machine with GDM and have a X session running on it? :P
2005-12-16T12:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cmd	of course you want a common 'home'  - which is a little harder.. but not too hard I think.. but there can be 'issues'
2005-12-16T12:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cmd	 i tend to have a /mount/remotepc/homes for each remote pc.
2005-12-16T12:43:00.000Z	cmd	Dr_Willis	I do not like virtualization such as VNC (far too slow) and SSH just to run commands I wish to avoid. I want the entire gui running at top speed. Is this achievable with what you mentioned?
2005-12-16T12:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cmd	 i have X running remotely - and its fairly decent. :P theres "X-terminal" machies that do just this. (no hd, just cpu , ram and a video card)
2005-12-16T12:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cmd	 dont expect quake4 to run good however. :P
2005-12-16T12:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cmd	 its fairly trivial to set up also.
2005-12-16T12:45:00.000Z	cmd		I just got Quake 4 but think I will play it on Windows :)
2005-12-16T12:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cmd	 to set up the nfs 'client'    sudo  mount master.foo.com:/home /mnt/home
2005-12-16T12:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		:)
2005-12-16T12:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		Been meaning to get Q4  - hows the multiplayer? all Deathmatch? or there CTF and so forth?
2005-12-16T12:47:00.000Z	cmd	Dr_Willis	yeah, I am trying that but am getting some sort of authorization errors... Trying a new trick now
2005-12-16T12:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cmd	 yea - ya need to set the hosts.allow and deny  the Howto says
2005-12-16T12:48:00.000Z	cmd	Dr_Willis	I think the hosts.allow, hosts.deny and just host and ther server were straigthforwared... The client is what I am on now, one sec, will run  sudo mount master.foo.com:/home /mnt/home now
