2011-12-22T03:56:00.000Z	newsun		Hello! pls tell me 32bit or 64bit

2011-12-22T03:58:00.000Z	sskalnik	newsun	 Possibly
2011-12-22T03:59:00.000Z	sskalnik	newsun	 Also, patience is a virtue. Being obnoxious like that will not elicit responses.
2011-12-22T03:59:00.000Z	newsun	sskalnik	Thanks for the reply.
2011-12-22T03:59:00.000Z	sskalnik	newsun	 That aside, to answer your question, it really depends on what you are doing with your machine. x64 might be a slightly better choice.
2011-12-22T04:00:00.000Z	sskalnik	newsun	 No prob
2011-12-22T04:03:00.000Z	newsun	sskalnik	I'm running out of RAM on the xp host with 2 solaris guests running simultaneously. Anyway, do you think the 64bit ubuntu will perform better than the 32bit as far as vbox is concerned?
2011-12-22T04:04:00.000Z	sskalnik	newsun	 As a guest or host?
2011-12-22T04:05:00.000Z	sskalnik	newsun	 I would use a 64bit ubuntu host (and a RAM upgrade ASAP).
2011-12-22T04:05:00.000Z	sskalnik	newsun	 The bottleneck is definitely the memory though, so that will limit what Ubuntu can do for you. Thankfully 8GB is like $40, so that should be a simple fix
2011-12-22T04:05:00.000Z	newsun	sskalnik	I'm afraid no more upgrade on THIS pc is possible. 2 DIMMs are filled
2011-12-22T04:06:00.000Z	sskalnik	newsun	 You may be able to pop out the old DIMMs and use new ones. If it's not more than a few years old, you can probably go up to at least 4GB if not several times more.
2011-12-22T04:07:00.000Z	newsun	sskalnik	The upgrade now means a whole new box entirely (which I do need btw, with usb3/RAID5/PCIe2 etc)
2011-12-22T04:08:00.000Z	sskalnik	newsun	 Sounds like a good plan. Ubuntu will probably be a bit better than Windows even without the hardware upgrade, but again, the hardware is the real issue.
2011-12-22T04:08:00.000Z	sskalnik	newsun	 hope that answers your quandary.
2011-12-22T04:10:00.000Z	newsun	sskalnik	Well, not quite. I do know I have to upgrade soon, but  for now I have to put up with what I have. So just curious about the 64bit
2011-12-22T04:12:00.000Z	sskalnik	newsun	 i would go with 64bit
2011-12-22T04:12:00.000Z	sskalnik	newsun	 Even though you would only use 2GB of RAM, you could benefit from faster native x64 code, and have an easier time with x64 guests.
2011-12-22T04:13:00.000Z	newsun	sskalnik	Thanks. That's all I needed to know, since the ubuntu download page never seems to consider the 64bit one "reccomendable" ;)
2011-12-22T04:13:00.000Z	sskalnik	newsun	 afaik that is changing.
2011-12-22T04:13:00.000Z	newsun	sskalnik	Sooner the better
