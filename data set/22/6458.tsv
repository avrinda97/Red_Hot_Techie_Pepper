2006-10-18T12:16:00.000Z	sergevn_		Good evening, I have a question, i have plugged my usbharddrive in my ubuntu machine, it autmounts prefect, but my question is: how can i configure autmount? so that it mounts using ntfs-fuse
2006-10-18T12:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sergevn_	Let me know if you find out.
2006-10-18T12:18:00.000Z	sergevn_	tonyyarusso	i havent found a solution yet :), i was asking the channel because i cant find it on tech forums etc.
2006-10-18T12:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sergevn_	yeah..I'm sure someone knows; I just haven't found them yet.
2006-10-18T12:21:00.000Z	sergevn_	tonyyarusso	I also tried adding it to /etc/fstab, but then it creates 2 mount points, the one i configged in fstab and an autogenerated location; example: fstab, /media/data    automount then creates /media/data-1
2006-10-18T12:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sergevn_	Eww.
2006-10-18T12:21:00.000Z	sergevn_	tonyyarusso	I can work with it, but i want to just edit the automount configuration :)
2006-10-18T12:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sergevn_	Yeah, my hope was to mount flash drives with the "sync" option so I could pull them out whenever without unmounting.
2006-10-18T12:22:00.000Z	sergevn_	tonyyarusso	that is working with me, hot swappable, but not mounting it hotswappable with writeable access
2006-10-18T12:23:00.000Z	sergevn_	tonyyarusso	it is a NTFS partition with all my data on it :)
2006-10-18T12:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sergevn_	Could be important
2006-10-18T12:25:00.000Z	sergevn_	tonyyarusso	I tried disabling it in the Prerences> Removeable Drives and Media, and then manual mounting them, but then he cant find the device anymore in /dev/
2006-10-18T12:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sergevn_	Maybe they're just named differently?
2006-10-18T12:26:00.000Z	sergevn_	tonyyarusso	The devices, yes but what i can find it dmesg when i plug in the hdd, it says /dev/sdb1, but when i try to mount then he cant find the device.
2006-10-18T12:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sergevn_	Hmm, don't know what it's doing then.
2006-10-18T12:29:00.000Z	sergevn_	tonyyarusso	ah well, my cousin is coming to visit this evening, and he's a debain guru so hopefully he can fix it :), ill let you know then i solved the problem :)
2006-10-18T12:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sergevn_	Sweet
2006-10-18T12:37:00.000Z	sergevn_	tonyyarusso	i solved the problem, just disable the automounting in the Preferences>Removable Media and Devices, then edit fstab and add the following line: /dev/sdb1 /media/data ntfs-fuse auto,gid=1001,umask=0002 0 0              ntfs-fuse is software to write to ntfs, and it works :)
2006-10-18T12:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sergevn_	Interesting.
2006-10-18T12:38:00.000Z	sergevn_	tonyyarusso	Hope it's clear, im not so good in discribing things in english :)
2006-10-18T12:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sergevn_	Meh, fstab is universal :)
2006-10-18T12:39:00.000Z	sergevn_	tonyyarusso	Well im quite a rookie in linux myself so for me it's like "EUREKA!" :P
