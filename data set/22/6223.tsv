2008-02-28T03:58:00.000Z	Pie-rate		How can I fix my video drivers? I tried to install the latest version from nvidia and it completely hosed them, x won't start with them now.
2008-02-28T03:58:00.000Z	df00z	Pie-rate	nice, you broke it.
2008-02-28T03:59:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	bullshit
2008-02-28T04:00:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	no really. synaptic is a frontend to apt-get
2008-02-28T04:00:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	nvidia's site, but then I used nvidia's uninstaller to remove them, then I reinstalled the ones from the repos
2008-02-28T04:01:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	i didn't realize that's what you meant.
2008-02-28T04:01:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	i reinstalled linux-restricted-modules and nvidia-glx-new (which was what was installed before)
2008-02-28T04:03:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	i can't find anything in there through the sea of vesa garbage from the "failsafe" X GARBAGE in gutsy
2008-02-28T04:05:00.000Z	df00z	Pie-rate	starting the "bulletproof x" server creates a new log file...im not sure if it's Xorg.1.log, or 0.log..or 0.log.old...do a ls -al and see which log file is the 2nd latest, thats the one you want
2008-02-28T04:06:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	found it, went through it, but it's all about vesa too.
2008-02-28T04:07:00.000Z	df00z	Pie-rate	/etc/init.d/gdm stop, killall gdm, killall Xorg, startx
2008-02-28T04:07:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	grepped Xorg* for "nvidia" (ignoring case), nothing.
2008-02-28T04:10:00.000Z	df00z	Pie-rate	give that a shot, the log should have something about nvidia..if it doesnt...nvidia-xconfig i think will regenerate if if you just run as root
2008-02-28T04:10:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	kernel module version mismatch
2008-02-28T04:10:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	i reinstalled linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` though.
2008-02-28T04:11:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	no.
2008-02-28T04:13:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	so where did the nvidia installer install nvidia.ko?
2008-02-28T04:18:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	deleted 2 instances of nvidia.ko, reinstalled linux-restricted-modules and same error
2008-02-28T04:18:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	version mismatch
2008-02-28T04:19:00.000Z	df00z	Pie-rate	reinstall the nvidia driver package in synaptic?
2008-02-28T04:24:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	nope, didn't work.
2008-02-28T04:26:00.000Z	Pie-rate	df00z	i'm reinstalling everything, and going back to feisty. gutsy has been nothing but horrible experiences. tracker is broken. the nvidia driver version is broken. compositing literally works on maybe 0.5% of computers (mine works, but in general.)
