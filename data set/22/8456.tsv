2005-08-07T14:03:00.000Z	luminerd	f_newton	dang, it needs that much maintenence?
2005-08-07T14:17:00.000Z	f_newton	luminerd	I just left fc4 because it has serious updating issues
2005-08-07T14:23:00.000Z	f_newton	luminerd	you can change that
2005-08-07T14:25:00.000Z	f_newton	luminerd	remember when you were trying to find 25 just alike machines?
2005-08-07T14:25:00.000Z	luminerd	f_newton	what?
2005-08-07T14:36:00.000Z	f_newton	luminerd	ubuntu also seems to have a lot of restricted packages I dont quite understand that

2005-08-08T07:24:00.000Z	f_newton	luminerd	did you unplug the mouse while the machine is powered up?
2005-08-08T07:24:00.000Z	luminerd	f_newton	no, plus I rebooted anyway so that would've fixed it
2005-08-08T10:55:00.000Z	f_newton	luminerd	no need to be offensive
2005-08-08T10:56:00.000Z	f_newton	luminerd	that is very strange
