2005-08-31T14:20:00.000Z	hussam		if I uninstall firestarter + dpkg --purge firestarter, I should still be protected but Iptables firewall?
2005-08-31T14:21:00.000Z	nalioth	hussam	without iptables, your box will not work. so firestarter is just a frontend to manipulate them
2005-09-18T07:14:00.000Z	nalioth	hussam	yes lots of us
2005-09-18T07:32:00.000Z	hussam	nalioth	Seveas: is it true "Initializing modules" fails in breezy?
2005-09-18T07:33:00.000Z	nalioth	hussam	i run powerpc ubuntu. my problems are not gonna be your problems.
2005-09-18T07:33:00.000Z	nalioth	hussam	Seveas could tell you, probably

2005-11-15T14:43:00.000Z	nalioth	hussam	there is no fragmentation on linux
2005-11-15T14:43:00.000Z	nalioth	hussam	there is virtually no fragmentation on linux
2005-11-15T14:44:00.000Z	hussam	nalioth	there is defragmentation. the last time I cheked the disk at boot, it was 5+ % fragmented
2005-11-15T14:45:00.000Z	nalioth	hussam	that is considered "not enough to affect your system" levels
2005-11-15T14:45:00.000Z	hussam	nalioth	what if it increases?
2005-11-15T14:46:00.000Z	nalioth	hussam	then something is wrong with your system
2005-11-15T14:46:00.000Z	nalioth	hussam	it should stay ~5%
2005-11-16T08:34:00.000Z	nalioth	hussam	do LCD displays even have sync rates?
2005-11-16T08:35:00.000Z	hussam	nalioth	I think so. The Dell ones we have at the university do.
2005-11-16T08:35:00.000Z	nalioth	hussam	i think just running the xserver reconfig will do alright
2005-11-16T08:35:00.000Z	hussam	nalioth	ok cool
2005-11-16T08:42:00.000Z	hussam	nalioth	I hope my LCD screen gets delivered today. Otherwise I'd have to wait till Monday.
2005-11-17T16:27:00.000Z	nalioth	hussam	they will not be able to read your passwords
2005-11-17T16:27:00.000Z	nalioth	hussam	you'll be lucky if XP doesnt do bad things to your ext3
2005-11-17T16:28:00.000Z	hussam	nalioth	it's mounted as read-only
