2005-06-13T13:05:00.000Z	Efwis		I was able to fix it, now I can get going, but still no sound other then on the net
2005-06-13T13:05:00.000Z	Efwis		when I did the fist step in that fix, it said that esd wasn't on the system, yet I know it is
2005-06-13T13:07:00.000Z	Efwis		those went fine
2005-06-13T13:07:00.000Z	Efwis		thank god for the backup, thats what allowed me to get back in
2005-06-13T13:09:00.000Z	Efwis		after I put my username and pass in it would freeze unless I hit ctrl-alt F6 and did a killall esd
2005-06-13T13:10:00.000Z	Efwis		??
2005-06-13T13:10:00.000Z	Efwis		correct
2005-06-13T13:11:00.000Z	Efwis		looked around the boards and mine is totally different
2005-06-13T13:12:00.000Z	Efwis		for example, my son likes to play games on nick.com, the games he plays the sound works, I can play cd's with no problems too
2005-06-13T13:13:00.000Z	Efwis		i just don't have any system sounds without locking up the system or constantly hearing the question.wav from the greeter
2005-06-13T13:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Efwis	I take it you tried the "fix sound" howto on http://ubuntuguide.org ?
2005-06-13T13:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Efwis	I disabled sound server startup for gnome as well
2005-06-13T13:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Efwis	ah, disable it again then
2005-06-13T13:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Efwis	then use oss or alsa as output in bmp, xmms etc
2005-06-13T13:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Efwis	no, if you followed the howto you should now have dmix enabled
2005-06-13T13:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Efwis	I use gstreamer with rhythmbox, and OSS with beep
2005-06-13T13:23:00.000Z	Efwis	thoreauputic	was that for me?
2005-06-13T13:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Efwis	yes, sorry
2005-06-13T13:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Efwis	just type ` which esd ` ina terminal and post the output
2005-06-13T13:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Efwis	Ok so it's installed, obviously
2005-06-13T13:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Efwis	sorry that was for you
2005-06-13T13:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Efwis	I doubt it's anthing to do with your card
