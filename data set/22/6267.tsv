2007-02-20T09:13:00.000Z	Erealz		cous it takeing a long time to dl a file
2007-02-20T09:13:00.000Z	Erealz		and in windows it
2007-02-20T09:13:00.000Z	Erealz		gos much faster
2007-02-20T09:13:00.000Z	Erealz		what up with that
2007-02-20T09:13:00.000Z	Slart	Erealz	I don't think it's much slower than other clients.. might be the swarm?
2007-02-20T09:19:00.000Z	Slart	Erealz	it's not ubuntu that's dealing with torrents.. it's some application in ubuntu
2007-02-20T09:20:00.000Z	Slart	Erealz	find out what that application is called
2007-02-20T09:29:00.000Z	Slart	Erealz	then ask the people who made the client.. or install any of the other clients
2007-12-17T05:33:00.000Z	Slart	Erealz	if she has an internet-connection faster than a modem.. then yes
2007-12-17T05:34:00.000Z	Slart	Erealz	you can check out freenx too.. I think it might be better if the connection is slow
2007-12-17T05:40:00.000Z	Slart	Erealz	they separated the client and server parts.. vncserver is the server
2007-12-17T05:41:00.000Z	Slart	Erealz	I think apt-get supports tab completion.. so type apt-get install vnc and press tab.. you should get a list
2007-12-17T05:43:00.000Z	Slart	Erealz	go with vncserver
2007-12-17T05:46:00.000Z	Slart	Erealz	the client is usually called vnc viewer or something similar.. search the repos
2007-12-17T05:52:00.000Z	Slart	Erealz	want me to cut and paste our conversation from 5 minutes ago?
2007-12-17T05:53:00.000Z	Slart	Erealz	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/2805/
2007-12-17T05:56:00.000Z	Slart	Erealz	the different servers are basically the same.. some flavours offer some extra features.. but they are all compatible.. if you want the best experience match the client with the server
2007-12-17T06:06:00.000Z	Slart	Erealz	I don't think so.. there's a bugtracker I think
