2011-04-10T17:44:00.000Z	iszak		Is 10.10 relatively safe to use on a production server?
2011-04-10T17:44:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iszak	it is not a LTS
2011-04-10T17:44:00.000Z	iszak		I know, but in terms of stability, it's still good?
2011-04-10T17:44:00.000Z	iszak		10.04
2011-04-10T17:45:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iszak	you might look into Lucid Lynx, server support is 2010-2015
2011-04-10T17:45:00.000Z	iszak	benzaldehyde	it's not about support, I just want to know if it's stable.
2011-04-10T17:45:00.000Z	iszak		it's not about the support.
2011-04-10T17:45:00.000Z	iszak		it's about the stability, I don't mind upgrading when the EOL comes around.
2011-04-10T17:46:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iszak	it is stable but the next stable release drops in 18 days, so
2011-04-10T17:47:00.000Z	iszak	benzaldehyde	thanks, just this VPS (Xen based) hosting provider won't put Ubuntu 10.10 as available
2011-04-10T17:49:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iszak	i can relate--they ought to
2011-04-10T17:49:00.000Z	iszak	benzaldehyde	yeah it's not like I'm asking them to drop 10.04, just some users like up-to-date versions.
2011-04-10T17:51:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iszak	2012 is the next LTS, not very far from now
2011-04-10T17:51:00.000Z	iszak		Sure, but I don't want a LTS
2011-04-10T17:51:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iszak	one year 18 days to be exacy
2011-04-10T17:51:00.000Z	benzaldehyde		*exact
2011-04-10T17:51:00.000Z	iszak	benzaldehyde	I don't live in years
2011-04-10T17:51:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iszak	:D

2011-04-10T17:53:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	iszak	you could take your business to another VPS if you were so inclinded
2011-04-10T17:54:00.000Z	benzaldehyde		*inclined
2011-04-10T17:54:00.000Z	iszak	benzaldehyde	indeed however it seems they've come around to my way of thinking.
