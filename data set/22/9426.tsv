2004-11-07T14:28:00.000Z	altan		is it safe to remove vi if it says that it will also remove ubuntu-base? is ubuntu-base a meta-package with no real function like ubuntu-desktop?
2004-11-07T14:28:00.000Z	ogra	altan	yep
2004-11-07T16:14:00.000Z	ogra	altan	you dont need one ;)
2004-11-07T16:14:00.000Z	ogra	altan	everything is closed by default
2004-11-07T16:15:00.000Z	ogra	altan	except you installed any servers explicitly
2004-11-07T16:15:00.000Z	ogra	altan	which could open ports
2004-11-11T14:49:00.000Z	ogra	altan	in a 5 row script ? hmm
2004-11-12T06:35:00.000Z	altan	ogra	I believe that was me :)
2004-11-12T06:36:00.000Z	ogra	altan	so while trying use mv -i, if youre sure it does no harm leave -i
2004-11-12T06:37:00.000Z	ogra	altan	are the filenames ok ? so leave -i
2004-11-12T10:12:00.000Z	ogra	altan	will be in hoary in april ;)
2004-11-12T16:18:00.000Z	ogra	altan	what have you done ?
2004-11-12T16:19:00.000Z	altan	ogra	Synaptic refuses to download things unless it has competition for the bandwidth
2004-11-12T16:19:00.000Z	ogra	altan	never seen this...are you on warty ?
2004-11-12T16:20:00.000Z	altan	ogra	yes
2004-11-12T16:20:00.000Z	ogra	altan	looks more like a prob with the net, then synaptic
2004-11-12T16:21:00.000Z	altan	ogra	it's just with the ubuntu primary servers, I'm quite sure
2004-11-12T16:22:00.000Z	ogra	altan	dunno if they are package mirrors too: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/Archive/
2004-11-12T16:23:00.000Z	ogra	altan	hmm, but looks like....try one of them
2004-11-12T16:23:00.000Z	altan	ogra	I think I temporarily fixed the problem by leaving a window to ping google.com
2004-11-12T16:24:00.000Z	ogra	altan	why ?
2004-11-12T16:24:00.000Z	altan	ogra	I don't want to risk it now, it's working fast
