2008-06-28T09:13:00.000Z	Naisenu		Anyone for helping out with dual monitor support? Running a clean install of Hardy, nVidia 6600GT, TwinView. I am basically getting mirrored output on both displays. I can get one display working or the other, but not both. xorg.conf settings are here: http://rafb.net/p/JBfJzr38.html (Sorry, pastebin isn't working atm for me)
2008-06-28T09:13:00.000Z	Corkster	Naisenu	you install "nvidia-settings"
