2009-08-12T12:53:00.000Z	Polt{laptop}		I wish I could find out whether this is worth it or not
2009-08-12T12:53:00.000Z	Polt{laptop}		I have the Ubuntu Live DVD around here somewhere
2009-08-12T12:53:00.000Z	Polt{laptop}		I just need to boot with it and run these commands in bash
2009-08-12T12:53:00.000Z	Polt{laptop}		upgrade to ext4
2009-08-12T12:54:00.000Z	Polt{laptop}		everyone says there is a performance increase
2009-08-12T12:54:00.000Z	Polt{laptop}		since I am on a 1.2 ghz machine I want to know if it will make a difference
2009-08-12T12:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	you dont get the full benefit of ext4 with a converted fs
2009-08-12T13:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	you can use hdparm too but it is risky, if you push too far it can damage the drive pysically
2009-08-12T13:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	did you MD5 check the DVD ISO before burning?
2009-08-12T13:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	go for it, they'll laugh you out
2009-08-12T13:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	no, youo have a warranty. ou can take it back and say its not fit for purpose.
2009-08-12T13:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	so no its not, you just made a bad choice and the seller understands that happens so gives you some period for which you can evaluate it
2009-08-12T13:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	so its in no way fraud
2009-08-12T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	works on my systems circ 1999
2009-08-12T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	nvidia is hugely supported in linux
2009-08-12T14:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	then you are in the wrong channel if your issue is a monitor
2009-08-12T14:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	if its a CRT it may not transmit modelines, in which case you will have to enter them manually into xorg.conf
2009-08-12T14:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	you need LILO for that
2009-08-12T14:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	or grub2
2009-08-12T14:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	afaik, grub can't boot ISO files
2009-08-12T14:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	not all bootloaders can boot all media
2009-08-12T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Polt{laptop}	so if grub doesnt suit your needs you need a different boot loader, frankly i'm baffled why grub is default
