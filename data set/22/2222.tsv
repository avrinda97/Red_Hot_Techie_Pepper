2010-09-13T18:38:00.000Z	zfe		so, nobody has a clue about this usb installation
2010-09-13T18:38:00.000Z	zfe		:(
2010-09-13T18:38:00.000Z	zfe		it seems that the fs is corrupted
2010-09-13T18:38:00.000Z	popey	zfe	how did you make the usb stick?
2010-09-13T18:38:00.000Z	zfe	popey	both with unetbootin and the ubuntu utility
2010-09-13T18:38:00.000Z	popey	zfe	under what OS did you use unetbootin?

2010-09-13T18:40:00.000Z	popey	zfe	reformat the usb stick and try again?
2010-09-13T18:41:00.000Z	zfe	popey	it seems that many people have the same problem
2010-09-13T18:41:00.000Z	popey	zfe	i did read a problem where unetbootin under lucid can't make a maverick stick
2010-09-13T18:41:00.000Z	popey	zfe	dunno if its related
2010-09-13T18:41:00.000Z	zfe	popey	do you have a link?
2010-09-13T18:41:00.000Z	popey	zfe	no, it was just something I'd seen on irc, did you use lucid to make the stick?
2010-09-13T18:42:00.000Z	zfe	popey	i'm on debian
2010-09-13T18:42:00.000Z	popey	zfe	hmm, testing?
