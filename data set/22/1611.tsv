2010-03-21T16:48:00.000Z	Milp		i mean im trying to start it from inside a console in lxde
2010-03-21T16:49:00.000Z	Milp		no gnea, i didnt actually start or install openbox implicitly, i just thought it kinda did that itself
2010-03-21T16:49:00.000Z	Milp		what do you mean gnea?
2010-03-21T16:50:00.000Z	Milp		i cant just start gui apps from the console though
2010-03-21T16:50:00.000Z	Milp		and i want to use gui apps
2010-03-21T16:50:00.000Z	Milp		yes but i need a desktop environment to run gui apps
2010-03-21T16:51:00.000Z	Milp		i dont really have openbox set up
2010-03-21T16:51:00.000Z	Milp		i was just thinking that lxde had openbox coming with it as a sort of xserver replacement
2010-03-21T16:51:00.000Z	Milp		yeah and i want to find out what it is D:
2010-03-21T16:51:00.000Z	Milp		ah ok
2010-03-21T16:52:00.000Z	mowe	Milp	openbox is the windwomanager of lxde
2010-03-21T16:52:00.000Z	Milp		so openbox to lxde is like gnome to xserver?
2010-03-21T16:53:00.000Z	Milp		ah ok
2010-03-21T16:53:00.000Z	mowe		:)
2010-03-21T16:53:00.000Z	Milp		thanks :D
2010-03-21T16:53:00.000Z	Milp		well where would i start finding out what is wrong when i always keep getting the 'cant connect to xserver' error with any application?
2010-03-21T16:54:00.000Z	mowe	Milp	is startx working?
2010-03-21T16:55:00.000Z	Milp	mowe	its not quite that easy. The console can only be accessed via ssh and the graphical frontend can only be accessed via vnc
2010-03-21T16:55:00.000Z	Milp	mowe	so naturally if i do startx from ssh i get errors
2010-03-21T16:56:00.000Z	mowe	Milp	can't help you with that, i'm clueless xD
2010-03-21T16:56:00.000Z	Milp	mowe	lol D: do you know of any logfiles that i could check or anything?
2010-03-21T16:57:00.000Z	mowe	Milp	i think dmesg is always the first log you check, but i'm newb myself
