2007-07-19T09:31:00.000Z	Falstius		er, mount -o remount,rw /
2007-07-19T09:32:00.000Z	aricz	Falstius	: EXT3-fs: Unrecognized mount option "erro" or missing value..
2007-07-19T09:33:00.000Z	Falstius	aricz	what is the command like you used exactly?
2007-07-19T09:33:00.000Z	aricz	Falstius	: the one you just typed in here.. mount -o remount,rw /
2007-07-19T09:34:00.000Z	aricz	Falstius	: what do you mean? fschk.ext3.
2007-07-19T09:35:00.000Z	Falstius	aricz	it is how you check your filesystem for errors
2007-07-19T09:36:00.000Z	aricz	Falstius	: WARNING: bad format on line 10 of /etc/fstab
2007-07-19T09:37:00.000Z	aricz	Falstius	: ok, I've not done that..
2007-07-19T09:37:00.000Z	Falstius	aricz	make sure / is mounted RO and then run that (there are switches for a more thorough check, but start with the basic).  If there is a filesystem error it may prevent mounting RW.
2007-07-19T09:38:00.000Z	aricz	Falstius	: the problem is my /etc/fstab..
2007-07-19T09:38:00.000Z	aricz	Falstius	: line 9 and 10 in /etc/fstab should be together.. :)
2007-07-19T09:38:00.000Z	aricz	Falstius	: I cut'n'paste into /etc/fstab .. and forgot to fix the cut lines
2007-07-19T09:38:00.000Z	Falstius	aricz	ahh.
2007-07-19T09:39:00.000Z	aricz	Falstius	: but I can't edit /etc/fstab.. because of / ro .. :)
2007-07-19T09:39:00.000Z	Falstius	aricz	so don't use fstab, sudo mount -o remount,rw /dev/sda1 /
2007-07-19T09:39:00.000Z	Falstius	aricz	replacing /dev/sda1 with your proper partition ofcourse
2007-07-19T09:40:00.000Z	aricz	Falstius	: ok, that worked
2007-07-19T10:51:00.000Z	Falstius	aricz	soundjuicer is installed by default
2007-07-19T11:00:00.000Z	Falstius	aricz	you could also just use soundjuicer which is already installed and won't pull in 50mb of dependencies.
2007-07-19T11:01:00.000Z	aricz	Falstius	: hehe yeah, that was what I thought about.. thought konqueror was some huge insane cd-audio ripping util.. but it's a damn file util.. :)
2007-07-19T11:02:00.000Z	Falstius	aricz	just go to soundjuicer preferences and select "CD Quality, Lossless" for output format.
2007-07-19T11:03:00.000Z	aricz	Falstius	: yup, thanks for the tip:)
