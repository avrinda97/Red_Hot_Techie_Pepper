2009-10-12T12:59:00.000Z	oroz		action thanks, ubuntu detects my mouse as a 32 button xextension pointer
2009-10-12T13:01:00.000Z	oroz		action: it moves around great, its the buttons that are problematic
2009-10-12T13:01:00.000Z	oroz		action: not at the moment
2009-10-12T13:02:00.000Z	pozic	oroz	32 buttons is kind of asking for problems ;)
2009-10-12T13:03:00.000Z	pozic	oroz	basically, just a program which returns a low-level number when an input event happens.
2009-10-12T13:04:00.000Z	pozic	oroz	if you have a lot of buttons, you just have to bind the right one to what X considers mouse button 1,2,3. I don't know by heart anymore how to do that, but it is well documented.
2009-10-12T13:05:00.000Z	pozic	oroz	then just open a terminal
2009-10-12T13:06:00.000Z	oroz	pozic	i opened terminal and typed gnome-terminal, and all it did it opened another terminal ;)
2009-10-12T13:07:00.000Z	pozic	oroz	if you want less dependence on other people, read a book on Linux/Unix.
2009-10-12T13:07:00.000Z	pozic	oroz	it makes you a vastly more able user.

2009-10-12T13:08:00.000Z	oroz	pozic	what im trying to do is, disable emulation of 3rd button
2009-10-12T13:09:00.000Z	pozic	oroz	you can do that with dpkg-reconfiguare xserver-xorg
2009-10-12T13:09:00.000Z	oroz	pozic	ive 'setup' mouse in xorg, but its not taking it
2009-10-12T13:09:00.000Z	pozic	oroz	have  you restarted X?
2009-10-12T13:09:00.000Z	oroz	pozic	ive done that too, restarted about 30 times
2009-10-12T13:09:00.000Z	pozic	oroz	saying lol also doesn't help.
2009-10-12T13:10:00.000Z	oroz	pozic	anyway, the 32 button thing wouldnt bother me at all, if mouse1+mouse2 didnt result in middle mouse
2009-10-12T13:10:00.000Z	oroz	pozic	so if you know how i could fix that it would be greatly appreciated
2009-10-12T13:10:00.000Z	pozic	oroz	if you want some real help, put all the inputs you give and all the outputs you get on some paste site and someone will probably help. I don't have more time to help, sorry.
2009-10-12T13:11:00.000Z	oroz	pozic	no offence, but no outputs came from you that were any new, but thanks for trying at least
