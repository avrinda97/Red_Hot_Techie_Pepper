2012-06-09T06:57:00.000Z	bazhang	Darkenvy	why are you adding java from a ppa
2012-06-09T06:57:00.000Z	bazhang	Darkenvy	I gave you a java link long before that
2012-06-09T06:59:00.000Z	bazhang	Darkenvy	go the oracle website if you need the closed one. get it from the package manager if you want the open one
2012-06-09T06:59:00.000Z	bazhang	Darkenvy	reading the link I gave you would tell you that
2012-06-09T07:00:00.000Z	bazhang	Darkenvy	there are browsers you can use for that
2012-06-09T07:13:00.000Z	bazhang	Darkenvy	what exact repo did you put in there
2012-06-09T07:15:00.000Z	bazhang	Darkenvy	people are volunteers. no one is being snide to you
