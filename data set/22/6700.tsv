2007-05-07T05:24:00.000Z	nopcode		linux-image-2.6.22-1-generic
2007-05-07T05:24:00.000Z	nopcode		according to kernel.org
2007-05-07T05:25:00.000Z	nopcode		2.6.22 doesnt exist
2007-05-07T05:26:00.000Z	nopcode		that's confusing
2007-05-07T05:26:00.000Z	predaeus	nopcode	I think they do their own patches
2007-05-07T05:26:00.000Z	nopcode	predaeus	but then you cant just increment the version number!!!!!
2007-05-07T05:27:00.000Z	predaeus	nopcode	actually I think it does but is the development branch now. I don't think ubuntu does what you are stating. where did you see this?
2007-05-07T05:28:00.000Z	predaeus	nopcode	does uname -r   report a 2.6.22 kernel?
2007-05-07T05:28:00.000Z	nopcode	predaeus	dunno
2007-05-07T05:29:00.000Z	predaeus	nopcode	run uname -r and you will know what kernel you are running
2007-05-07T05:32:00.000Z	predaeus	nopcode	are you on gutsy repos?
2007-05-07T05:32:00.000Z	nopcode	predaeus	i downloaded the kernel from gutsy manually
2007-05-07T05:32:00.000Z	predaeus	nopcode	so what is the problem?
2007-05-07T05:33:00.000Z	nopcode	predaeus	my ethernet nic doesnt work
2007-05-07T05:33:00.000Z	predaeus	nopcode	it likely is a patched 21
2007-05-07T05:34:00.000Z	predaeus	nopcode	the kernel maintainers themselves changed kernel version conventions recently.
2007-05-07T05:34:00.000Z	nopcode	predaeus	kernel org says 2.6.21 is latest
2007-05-07T05:35:00.000Z	predaeus	nopcode	and this is a logical way to do it in a development branch of ubuntu. stop flaming around here if it is your own fault using development packages. go to #ubuntu+1 if you want to talk about gutsy
2007-05-07T05:35:00.000Z	nopcode	predaeus	no its not a logical thing
2007-05-07T05:35:00.000Z	nopcode	predaeus	logical would be something like appending -ubuntu-1
2007-05-07T05:36:00.000Z	predaeus	nopcode	this is totally offtopic and if at all then it refers to gutsy so please ask there about it (#ubuntu+1)
2007-05-07T05:37:00.000Z	nopcode	predaeus	ok..
