2011-12-16T09:45:00.000Z	Zenonii		I've never had a problem with a mac, ever.
2011-12-16T09:45:00.000Z	Zenonii		I have many with my pc
2011-12-16T09:46:00.000Z	Zenonii		I had ubuntu running on it already

2011-12-16T09:46:00.000Z	Zenonii		what is that?
2011-12-16T09:46:00.000Z	Zenonii	ubuntu	runs easier on a mac, than a pc

2011-12-16T09:47:00.000Z	Zenonii		it is specific mac issues
