2007-06-08T12:45:00.000Z	niekie		:O
2007-06-08T12:47:00.000Z	niekie		Though nobody uses dial-up nowadays.
2007-06-08T12:48:00.000Z	niekie		Except for backup internet ;)
2007-06-08T12:49:00.000Z	niekie		I used GPRS for internet once.
2007-06-08T12:49:00.000Z	niekie		Over Bluetooth.
2007-06-08T12:49:00.000Z	niekie		From my phone.
2007-06-08T12:49:00.000Z	niekie		It worked quite okay.
2007-06-08T12:49:00.000Z	niekie		Though caused lots of data usage =(
2007-06-08T12:50:00.000Z	kazim59	niekie	gprs with bluetooth.. what did u use? pppd for dialing which device?
2007-06-08T12:50:00.000Z	niekie	kazim59	actually, I used some kind of howto.
2007-06-08T12:51:00.000Z	kazim59	niekie	oh good...
2007-06-08T12:51:00.000Z	niekie	kazim59	so I have no idea actually how I did it.
2007-06-08T12:52:00.000Z	kazim59	niekie	that happens most of the time with me too.. lol
2007-06-08T12:52:00.000Z	niekie		I remember I once set up dial-up networking between 2 PCs..
2007-06-08T12:52:00.000Z	niekie		As the network cable wasn't long enough between them.
2007-06-08T12:52:00.000Z	niekie		And we have this internal phone system.
2007-06-08T12:52:00.000Z	niekie		So we could just let it call the PC # and transfer a file.
2007-06-08T12:52:00.000Z	kazim59	niekie	once you were a genius!
2007-06-08T12:53:00.000Z	kazim59	niekie	just kidding... :)
2007-06-08T12:53:00.000Z	niekie	kazim59	that was with Windows XP, which I used to have a lot of experience with.
