2009-06-20T05:44:00.000Z	J_Litewski		it's a 91379 Digital camera usr13
2009-06-20T05:46:00.000Z	J_Litewski		I tried to load the drivers via WINE, no dice
2009-06-20T05:47:00.000Z	J_Litewski		lsusb lists the camera, I just want to be able to access the camera
2009-06-20T05:49:00.000Z	Zxcvb	J_Litewski	very few windows drivers will work in wine, you could try using gphoto2 though
2009-06-20T05:49:00.000Z	J_Litewski		and wine can't access it
2009-06-20T05:50:00.000Z	J_Litewski		ok
2009-06-20T05:50:00.000Z	Zxcvb	J_Litewski	what is the camera again?
2009-06-20T05:51:00.000Z	J_Litewski	Zxcvb	no, it's internal
2009-06-20T05:51:00.000Z	Zxcvb	J_Litewski	no, what is the brand name and model number of the camera?
2009-06-20T05:52:00.000Z	J_Litewski	Zxcvb	it's called the "91379 Digital Camera" with the word Digital written on the front of it
2009-06-20T05:54:00.000Z	Zxcvb	J_Litewski	does it have ptp or pictbridge support?
2009-06-20T05:54:00.000Z	J_Litewski	Zxcvb	most likely not, it's a 10 dollar camera
2009-06-20T05:55:00.000Z	Zxcvb	J_Litewski	do you have the usb ids (vendor id and product id) from lsusb?
2009-06-20T05:56:00.000Z	J_Litewski		just a sec
2009-06-20T05:57:00.000Z	J_Litewski		Bus 002 Device 005: ID 0979:0227 Jeilin Technology Corp., Ltd <-- Zxcvb
2009-06-20T05:57:00.000Z	Zxcvb	J_Litewski	nothing listed, but install gphoto2 and run gphoto2 --auto-detect
2009-06-20T05:58:00.000Z	Zxcvb	J_Litewski	your camera only lets you delete the last picture taken, right?
2009-06-20T06:00:00.000Z	J_Litewski		stupid wireless
2009-06-20T06:00:00.000Z	Zxcvb	J_Litewski	you run gphoto2 --auto-detect from the terminal
2009-06-20T06:01:00.000Z	Zxcvb	J_Litewski	does your camera only let you delete the last picture you took?
2009-06-20T07:24:00.000Z	J_Litewski	Zxcvb	gphoto2 doesn't auto-detect
2009-06-20T07:24:00.000Z	Zxcvb	J_Litewski	oh well, worth a try
