2009-02-14T06:39:00.000Z	Weehawky		I'm seeing that I can try cat /dev/scd0 > /some/place/name.iso ?
2009-02-14T06:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Weehawky	 often one uses 'dd' instead of cat.. but i think cat can work also
2009-02-14T06:41:00.000Z	Weehawky	Dr_Willis	Will this make the ISO bootable as if I copied it from CD to CD , or DVD to DVD ?
2009-02-14T06:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Weehawky	 its an identical clone.. so yes. it should
2009-02-14T06:42:00.000Z	Weehawky	Dr_Willis	OK.  I'm looking for a way to keep my XP on disk.  I'm tired of digging it out for virtualbox
2009-02-14T06:42:00.000Z	Weehawky	Dr_Willis	Also I want to make a spare copy anyway.
2009-02-14T06:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Weehawky	 i do a similer thing for my os disks :)
2009-02-14T06:44:00.000Z	Weehawky	Dr_Willis	I just have to find a way for it to not want to authorize
2009-02-14T06:44:00.000Z	Weehawky	Dr_Willis	 I'm afraid I'll mess up my licensee as if I installed it on a second computer.
2009-02-14T06:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Weehawky	 that will most likely be the case.   of course discission of ways around that.. are proberly not  for here. :)
2009-02-14T06:47:00.000Z	Weehawky	Dr_Willis	The ISO from disk seems to run twice or better faster than from the DVD+-RW drive
2009-02-14T06:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Weehawky	 in vmware/birtualbox. yes.. using a .iso file will be MUCH MUCH faster
2009-02-14T06:48:00.000Z	Weehawky	Dr_Willis	Would it be possible for me to not have to run virtualbox as root ?
2009-02-14T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Weehawky	 i dont recall having to run it as root..
2009-02-14T06:49:00.000Z	Weehawky	Dr_Willis	It complains of things after making the fixed disk space
2009-02-14T06:49:00.000Z	Weehawky	Dr_Willis	 (if I don't)
2009-02-14T06:50:00.000Z	Weehawky	Dr_Willis	"The VirtualBox kernel driver is not accessible to the current user. Make sure that the user has write permissions for /dev/vboxdrv by adding them to the vboxusers groups. You will need to logout for the change to take effect."
2009-02-14T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Weehawky	 i dont recall ever having that problem. But i havent messed with  vbox in linux in a month+
2009-02-14T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Weehawky	 theres the issue then it iseems.. user not in the right groups.
2009-02-14T06:51:00.000Z	Weehawky	Dr_Willis	How would I fix that
2009-02-14T06:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Weehawky	 i do it the old-skool way and edit the /etc/groups file :)
2009-02-14T06:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Weehawky	 but thats not the safext way
