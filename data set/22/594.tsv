2011-08-17T22:40:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. Is it really that hard to use an nvidia video card with Ubuntu? What do I have to do to install and activate th drivers?
2011-08-17T22:41:00.000Z	rakathan	vlt	Nvidia drivers usually play pretty nice with Ubuntu...with a clean install you should be able to just download the binary off the Nvidia site and run it
2011-08-17T22:42:00.000Z	vlt	rakathan	Nvidia site? What’s the nvidia-173 stuff for then?
2011-08-17T22:43:00.000Z	rakathan	vlt	Ubuntu provides an outdated (yet tested) driver originally from Nvidia...that's what you install when you click the "install proprietary drivers" button
2011-08-17T22:43:00.000Z	vlt	rakathan	That’s what I did. After installing: How to activate it now?
2011-08-17T22:51:00.000Z	rakathan	vlt	are you having any specific problems with it?
2011-08-17T22:43:00.000Z	rakathan	vlt	if you download drivers directly from the nvidia site instead of from the restricted drivers part of Ubuntu, you get drivers that are more up to date and likely to play nice with Ubuntu
2011-08-17T22:44:00.000Z	rakathan	vlt	do an lsmod for me and link the paste here...http://paste.ubuntu.com/
2011-08-17T22:44:00.000Z	rakathan	vlt	you might as well also include lspci

2011-08-17T22:48:00.000Z	rakathan	vlt	what model Nvidia card are you using?  It seems to have the AGP driver loaded for some reason
2011-08-17T22:49:00.000Z	vlt	rakathan	Doesn’t the lspci part of the paste tell you?
2011-08-17T22:49:00.000Z	rakathan	vlt	I see it now...missed it at first
2011-08-17T22:50:00.000Z	rakathan	vlt	that is a VERY old card
2011-08-17T22:50:00.000Z	vlt	rakathan	Ok, how to use it?
2011-08-17T22:51:00.000Z	rakathan	vlt	hmm, it should be supported...honestly, it looks like the driver is already in use and you don't need to do anything else

2011-08-17T22:53:00.000Z	rakathan	vlt	I'm afraid I don't have any ideas...I trust you've already done the appropriate googling for this
2011-08-17T22:54:00.000Z	rakathan	vlt	if you haven't seen it already, this might help...http://phun-ky.net/2008/10/fix-for-failed-to-load-the-nvidia-kernel-module-on-ubuntu
2011-08-17T22:55:00.000Z	rakathan	vlt	you might also have an issue if your xorg.conf that breaks it...have you tried nvidia-xconfig?
2011-08-17T22:56:00.000Z	vlt	rakathan	Yes, I also ran nvidia-xconfig before.
2011-08-17T23:01:00.000Z	rakathan	vlt	I meant viruses from an unmounted partition can't jump out unless that partition gets mounted...for the nvidia card problem, I don't have any more ideas...I'm a little disappointed since nvidia usually works much better
