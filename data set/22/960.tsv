2010-12-27T08:56:00.000Z	potat0		that took a long while
2010-12-27T08:56:00.000Z	potat0		back
2010-12-27T08:57:00.000Z	potat0		hmm apparently not
2010-12-27T08:58:00.000Z	potat0		Asus motherboard right?
2010-12-27T08:58:00.000Z	bandit5432	potat0	i tried to get him to pass some options to the bootloader any ideas
2010-12-27T08:58:00.000Z	bandit5432	potat0	i have a vm up of the boot screen if that helps
2010-12-27T08:59:00.000Z	potat0	bandit5432	the problem is that his hdd's aren't being initialised
2010-12-27T08:59:00.000Z	bandit5432	potat0	 ewww
2010-12-27T08:59:00.000Z	bandit5432	potat0	has he tried installing instead of running the livecd?
2010-12-27T09:00:00.000Z	potat0	bandit5432	to install, he needs the hdd's to be recognised
2010-12-27T09:13:00.000Z	bandit5432	potat0	to boot a livecd it does not need a harddrive does it?
2010-12-27T09:14:00.000Z	potat0	bandit5432	to install, yes
2010-12-27T09:14:00.000Z	bandit5432	potat0	he cant get to the livecd to ret anything out yet
2010-12-27T09:15:00.000Z	potat0	bandit5432	I don't think that even the cdrom device is being mounted properly
2010-12-27T09:16:00.000Z	bandit5432	potat0	all is good this seems to be a common error though
2010-12-27T09:16:00.000Z	potat0	bandit5432	weird hardware causes this normally, there has to be a bug report filed under a different motherboard
2010-12-27T09:17:00.000Z	bandit5432	potat0	seeing on other forums that having other devices pluggedin causes this as well
2010-12-27T09:20:00.000Z	bandit5432	potat0	lols
2010-12-27T09:57:00.000Z	bandit5432	potat0	lols ty
2010-12-27T09:58:00.000Z	potat0	bandit5432	what's he trying to do?
