2009-12-21T07:15:00.000Z	Zenith88		did anybody try setting console resolution to anything other than standard 640x480? how can I change console resolution? neither vga option seems to work.
2009-12-21T07:16:00.000Z	Daifan	Zenith88	do you have a graphics card?
2009-12-21T07:16:00.000Z	Zenith88	Daifan	an extra one?
2009-12-21T07:17:00.000Z	Daifan	Zenith88	no, is there one that is installed in your linux machine.
2009-12-21T07:18:00.000Z	Zenith88	Daifan	of course, it's GF 6800. when I used Fedora and 2.6.32, I used 0x346 mode. but now under 9.10 the vga option always results in 'deprecated' error
2009-12-21T07:18:00.000Z	Daifan	Zenith88	Have you installed the drivers?
2009-12-21T07:19:00.000Z	Zenith88	Daifan	hard to tell, I just did an almost complete install of Ubuntu, choosing mostly default packages.
2009-12-21T07:19:00.000Z	Zenith88	Daifan	the X have NV driver installed
2009-12-21T07:20:00.000Z	Daifan	Zenith88	You're using ubuntu desktop? There should be something in the System menu that will install drivers for you.
2009-12-21T07:21:00.000Z	Zenith88	Daifan	Using Ubuntu Studio. Which driver should I install?
2009-12-21T07:22:00.000Z	Daifan	Zenith88	Follow this tutorial right here. http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/nvidia
2009-12-21T07:23:00.000Z	Zenith88	Daifan	Nvidia 185 driver is installed and in use
2009-12-21T07:25:00.000Z	Daifan	Zenith88	Did you run nvidia x server settings?
2009-12-21T07:25:00.000Z	Zenith88	Daifan	how's X server relevant?
2009-12-21T07:26:00.000Z	Daifan	Zenith88	What are you trying to expand? The console windows?
2009-12-21T07:26:00.000Z	Zenith88	Daifan	I want to change text console resolution
2009-12-21T07:27:00.000Z	Daifan	Zenith88	Ahh, I didn't understand your question then. Sorry mate.
2009-12-21T07:27:00.000Z	Zenith88	Daifan	not a problem
2009-12-21T07:29:00.000Z	Daifan	Zenith88	You can edit /boot/grub/menu.lst file to your specification if you want to change console size.
2009-12-21T07:30:00.000Z	Zenith88	Daifan	I know, that's what I tried. But the kernel throws an error for every vga option I tried, including the modes listed by vbeinfo
2009-12-21T07:31:00.000Z	Daifan	Zenith88	Did you update grub after changing the settings?
2009-12-21T07:31:00.000Z	Zenith88	Daifan	:) Of course, that's how I got the errors
