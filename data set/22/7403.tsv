2006-08-06T08:03:00.000Z	tanath	orbin	every time, whichever seveas mirror i use, it always says  E: Unable to parse package file

2006-08-06T08:06:00.000Z	orbin	tanath	ping him when he's active. dunno sorry
2006-08-06T08:06:00.000Z	tanath	orbin	the first time i asked, he asked if i was using edgy... i told him dapper, and he never said anything after that
2006-08-06T08:07:00.000Z	orbin	tanath	what package are you after?
2006-08-06T08:08:00.000Z	orbin	tanath	maybe just browse it via webbrowser, grab the deb files you need, then install w/ dpkg
2006-08-06T08:08:00.000Z	tanath	orbin	ubuntu-fglrx-686 etc

2006-08-06T08:08:00.000Z	tanath	orbin	i ended up with something broken, and want the repo to work so everything can be automated
2006-08-06T08:09:00.000Z	orbin	tanath	found this: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/50766 ... but it's slightly different from your error
2006-08-06T08:10:00.000Z	tanath	orbin	yeh, a bit different
2006-08-06T08:12:00.000Z	orbin	tanath	hopefully not just to fix that issue :-/
2006-08-06T08:12:00.000Z	tanath	orbin	why not?
