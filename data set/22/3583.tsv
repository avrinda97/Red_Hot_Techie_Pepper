2009-01-01T22:21:00.000Z	savvas	tavi	try holding Shift+T while playing the movie - Shift+R makes it smaller
2009-01-01T22:22:00.000Z	tavi	savvas	don´t work
2009-01-01T22:22:00.000Z	savvas	tavi	did you hold it for 5 seconds while playing the movie?
2009-01-01T22:22:00.000Z	tavi	savvas	yes
2009-01-01T22:23:00.000Z	savvas	tavi	then find it somewhere in the preferences/settings :)
2009-01-01T22:23:00.000Z	tavi	savvas	i searched
2009-01-01T22:23:00.000Z	savvas	tavi	or right-click on the main window and look for subtitle options, size or whatever
2009-01-01T22:23:00.000Z	tavi	savvas	at right click nothing happens
2009-01-01T22:23:00.000Z	savvas	tavi	I think you have to press save/apply, close the menu, close kmplayer and restart it.
2009-01-01T22:24:00.000Z	tavi	savvas	is so stupid?
2009-01-01T22:24:00.000Z	savvas	tavi	does it mention a shortcut next to the right-click for subtitle size?
2009-01-01T22:24:00.000Z	tavi	savvas	like i said at fright click nothing happens
2009-01-01T22:25:00.000Z	tavi	savvas	nothign is showed
2009-01-01T22:25:00.000Z	savvas	tavi	yes, but do you SEE if it says on the right a shortcut command, like "+" or "Shift+Something" ?
2009-01-01T22:25:00.000Z	tavi	savvas	nothing
2009-01-01T22:26:00.000Z	savvas	tavi	well.. I'm out of ideas :)
