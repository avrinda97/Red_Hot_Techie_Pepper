2007-12-30T22:17:00.000Z	kasplatt		hey , am trying to install ubuntu over a previous linux install , but I can't figure out how to make it install over the linux partition , since I want windows to be intact. I'm not sure where it installs if I do the "guided install" and set it to 100% , it says 38 GB but both hdds are around 40 GB each
2007-12-30T22:17:00.000Z	kasplatt		I mean both partitions are around 40 gb each
2007-12-30T22:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kasplatt	 you could use gparted to delete the linux install/filesystems  you dont want to keep and let the installer install to the 'unallocated' space
2007-12-30T22:18:00.000Z	kasplatt	Dr_Willis	how do I do that ? do I download gparted ? or is it already installed ?
2007-12-30T22:18:00.000Z	kasplatt	Dr_Willis	am on the livecd right now
2007-12-30T22:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kasplatt	 its on the ubuntu live cd i thijk. I always use the 'gparted livecd' you can get on the internet. Its a darn handy livecd/tool to have around.
2007-12-30T22:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kasplatt	 or explore teh installer and do like astro76  said.
2007-12-30T22:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kasplatt	 / would be /dev/sda2 in that case
2007-12-30T22:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kasplatt	 '/' is the mountpoint  - not /media/sda2
2007-12-30T22:21:00.000Z	kasplatt	Dr_Willis	it was under the "Mount Point" tab in the installer
2007-12-30T22:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kasplatt	 since it had existing data on it. the installer put it someplace 'safe' :)  it assumes you dont want to trash it.
2007-12-30T22:25:00.000Z	kasplatt	Dr_Willis	gparted doesn't give me the option to delete sda2 , only sda1 which I don't want to delete
2007-12-30T22:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kasplatt	 the partitions you are working on. MUST MUST MUST - be unmounted.
2007-12-30T22:26:00.000Z	kasplatt	Dr_Willis	awesome , thanks
2007-12-30T22:27:00.000Z	kasplatt	Dr_Willis	so I just delete sda2 , should I delete sda3 and sda5 also ?
2007-12-30T22:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kasplatt	 you can. that should be the swap partition.
2007-12-30T22:28:00.000Z	kasplatt	Dr_Willis	but will my freshly installed ubuntu use the old swap partition or should I delete the one I have now and use a new one ?
2007-12-30T22:30:00.000Z	kasplatt	Dr_Willis	i'll just delete everything except sda1 and let the installer do the rest , that would be best , right ?
2007-12-30T22:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kasplatt	 thats what i normally do
2007-12-30T22:30:00.000Z	kasplatt	Dr_Willis	ok great
2007-12-30T22:32:00.000Z	kasplatt	Dr_Willis	what is sdc0 ? it has 172 MiB of unallocated space
2007-12-30T22:32:00.000Z	kasplatt	Dr_Willis	I mean scd0
