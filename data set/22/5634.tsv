2008-12-14T06:15:00.000Z	raylu	Flannel	cpu power schemas
2008-12-14T12:26:00.000Z	Flannel	raylu	Please stop that
2008-12-14T12:50:00.000Z	raylu	Flannel	wait, seriously?
2008-12-14T12:50:00.000Z	Flannel	raylu	about what?
2008-12-14T12:50:00.000Z	raylu	Flannel	upgrade to 8.10 only from alternate, not from desktop?
2008-12-14T12:51:00.000Z	Flannel	raylu	you can only upgrade (upgrade, not reinstall) from the alternate CDs, Desktops can only do installations.
2008-12-14T12:51:00.000Z	raylu	Flannel	that's kinda broken...
2008-12-14T12:53:00.000Z	Flannel	raylu	Not really.  It makes sense when you know how the desktop works
2009-01-02T01:38:00.000Z	raylu	Flannel	woah. i'm going to remember that
2009-01-03T13:30:00.000Z	raylu	Flannel	that solution is kinda... ew...
2009-01-08T11:23:00.000Z	Flannel	raylu	That's not necessary.
2009-01-08T11:29:00.000Z	raylu	Flannel	i thought aptitude kept track of automatically installed dependencies?
2009-01-08T11:30:00.000Z	Flannel	raylu	apt does too now.
2009-01-08T11:30:00.000Z	raylu	Flannel	oh. but apt-get lies about its super cow powers
2009-01-08T11:30:00.000Z	raylu	Flannel	clearly a bug.
2009-01-08T11:30:00.000Z	Flannel	raylu	Clearly offtopic ;)
2009-04-05T05:11:00.000Z	Flannel	raylu	Please don't recommend that here.
2009-04-05T05:11:00.000Z	raylu	Flannel	why not?
2009-06-29T04:47:00.000Z	Flannel	raylu	When helping, please be helpful.
2009-06-29T04:48:00.000Z	raylu	Flannel	sorry :(
2009-06-29T04:55:00.000Z	Flannel	raylu	Only if you install with the alternate CD
2009-06-29T04:56:00.000Z	raylu	Flannel	i've always installed with the desktop cd on a usb and it's been there
