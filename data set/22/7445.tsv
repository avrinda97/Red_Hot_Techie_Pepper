2006-03-29T17:17:00.000Z	h0nus_		ok this is gonna be a ridiculously simple question but it's my first day... once i've downloaded a tar.gz or tar.bz2 to /tmp what is the proper way to install it?
2006-03-29T17:19:00.000Z	bimberi	h0nus_	tell us what it is (just in case there's a better way to install)
2006-03-29T17:20:00.000Z	bimberi	h0nus_	kk (don't see that one in ubuntu's repositories)
2006-03-29T17:20:00.000Z	h0nus_	bimberi	no you probably won't-- it's a chat client for gamers
2006-03-29T17:22:00.000Z	bimberi	h0nus_	you unpack a .tar.gz with 'tar xvzf <file>', a .tar.bz2 with 'tar xvjf <file>' - then look for install instructions in a file called README or INSTALL
2006-03-29T17:26:00.000Z	bimberi	h0nus_	use 'ls' to check what files are in the directory you're currently in
2006-03-29T17:28:00.000Z	h0nus_	bimberi	my syntax was wrong
2006-03-29T17:28:00.000Z	bimberi	h0nus_	kk
2006-03-29T17:29:00.000Z	h0nus_	bimberi	how do I "start up" a file with a .sh extension?
2006-03-29T17:29:00.000Z	bimberi	h0nus_	sh file.sh
2006-03-29T17:30:00.000Z	h0nus_	bimberi	thanks again
2006-03-29T17:33:00.000Z	h0nus_	bimberi	one more question
2006-03-29T17:35:00.000Z	bimberi	h0nus_	sure, feel free to just ask the channel, if i know i'll answer :)
2006-03-29T17:40:00.000Z	bimberi	h0nus_	right-click on the desktop, select 'Create Launcher'
2006-03-29T17:41:00.000Z	bimberi	h0nus_	command will be the path to the .sh file,  you'll also be able to set an icon
2006-03-29T17:42:00.000Z	h0nus_	bimberi	there's an image that comes with the program that i would like to use as the icon, but it does not appear in the list
2006-03-29T17:43:00.000Z	bimberi	h0nus_	there should be a Browse.. button in the Icon Selection window
2006-03-29T17:43:00.000Z	h0nus_	bimberi	the image extension is .xmp
2006-03-29T17:44:00.000Z	h0nus_	bimberi	do i want to run it in terminal or no?
2006-03-29T17:45:00.000Z	bimberi	h0nus_	not if it's a GUI app
2006-03-29T17:45:00.000Z	bimberi	h0nus_	great! :)
2006-03-29T17:47:00.000Z	bimberi	h0nus_	:) ok  -  btw you can drag the launcher onto a panel to have a button there
