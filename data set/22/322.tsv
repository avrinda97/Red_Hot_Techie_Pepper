2011-12-21T08:17:00.000Z	vouth		Hi, when I try to build Mesa  from source, it fails with this error: http://pastebin.com/UFcpHx7s My config.log from that was: http://pastebin.com/qw7B0QaA
2011-12-21T08:18:00.000Z	vouth		sorry, couldn't resist :-D
2011-12-21T08:19:00.000Z	TiMiDo	vouth	why are you running ./configure as root?
2011-12-21T08:20:00.000Z	vouth	TiMiDo	I read on a forum that it helped someone
2011-12-21T08:21:00.000Z	vouth	TiMiDo	Ok. Sounds good. I already have gcc as the "latest version" according to apt-get
2011-12-21T08:22:00.000Z	vouth	TiMiDo	same result
2011-12-21T08:23:00.000Z	TiMiDo	vouth	now paste the config.log
2011-12-21T08:25:00.000Z	vouth	TiMiDo	http://pastebin.com/XkqnayX0
2011-12-21T08:26:00.000Z	TiMiDo	vouth	what are you compiling by the way some mesa drivers?
2011-12-21T08:27:00.000Z	vouth	TiMiDo	I'm using a VIA chipset that's not supported by the version of Mesa supplied with 10.10
2011-12-21T08:28:00.000Z	vouth	TiMiDo	Compiz etc therefore aren't working
2011-12-21T08:28:00.000Z	TiMiDo	vouth	read the links i just give you
2011-12-21T08:31:00.000Z	vouth	TiMiDo	Well, they're both about ATI. This is a VIA KM400.
2011-12-21T08:31:00.000Z	vouth	TiMiDo	Should I try the ATI drivers anyway?
2011-12-21T08:31:00.000Z	TiMiDo	vouth	intel/amd?
2011-12-21T08:32:00.000Z	TiMiDo	vouth	yeah give it a go
2011-12-21T08:32:00.000Z	vouth	TiMiDo	amd
2011-12-21T08:36:00.000Z	vouth	TiMiDo	Ok, I'm downloading fglrx. It's pretty big!
2011-12-21T08:48:00.000Z	vouth	TiMiDo	I just restarted after installing the new driver. Nothing seems to have changed.
2011-12-21T08:51:00.000Z	vouth	TiMiDo	Should I keep trying to build Mesa?
2011-12-21T08:51:00.000Z	TiMiDo	vouth	yeah or apt-cache search mesa and see the drivers it has
2011-12-21T08:53:00.000Z	vouth	TiMiDo	There's a pretty big mesa drivers there (pardon the pun), but they'll all be out of date.
