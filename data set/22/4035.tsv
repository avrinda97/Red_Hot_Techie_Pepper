2008-04-03T17:46:00.000Z	Survivorman	ubuhackaa	are you using gutsy?
2008-04-03T17:47:00.000Z	Survivorman	ubuhackaa	or are you using Hardy?
2008-04-03T17:47:00.000Z	ubuhackaa	Survivorman	I'm using Hardy Heron.
2008-04-03T17:51:00.000Z	Survivorman	ubuhackaa	I replied to you above... take a look and see if that seems like your problem. It says the restricted driver is being used but no wireless?
2008-04-03T17:53:00.000Z	Survivorman	ubuhackaa	do you have a green light in restricted driver?
2008-04-03T17:53:00.000Z	ubuhackaa	Survivorman	Where's the green light?
2008-04-03T17:54:00.000Z	ubuhackaa	Survivorman	sorry, I'm not using GNOME. Is there a command for the console?
2008-04-03T17:55:00.000Z	Survivorman	ubuhackaa	I would remove the fwcutter program and purge, then reinstall it. get the apsto *spelling, file, and run fwcutter filename from the commandline.
2008-04-03T17:56:00.000Z	Survivorman	ubuhackaa	I had the same problem and fixed it that way.
2008-04-03T17:57:00.000Z	ubuhackaa	Survivorman	Ok, I already did this plenty times. Maybe it's working now. I'll try it.
2008-04-03T17:58:00.000Z	ubuhackaa	Survivorman	Which packages did you remove?
2008-04-03T17:58:00.000Z	ubuhackaa	Survivorman	Is b43-fwcutter sufficient? Or where is the b43-module stored in? sudo apt-get remove --purge b43-fwcutter
2008-04-03T17:59:00.000Z	Survivorman	ubuhackaa	then I reinstalled it, and then ran bw4-fwcutter driverfilename
2008-04-03T18:01:00.000Z	Survivorman	ubuhackaa	if you need the driver, I have it and can send it
2008-04-03T18:02:00.000Z	ubuhackaa	Survivorman	You mean the driver module? Or the driver for ndiswrapper?
2008-04-03T18:03:00.000Z	Survivorman	ubuhackaa	the driver for fwcutter
2008-04-03T18:04:00.000Z	ubuhackaa	Survivorman	Yeah, that would be nice.
2008-04-03T18:04:00.000Z	ubuhackaa	Survivorman	Could you private-mesage me?
2008-04-03T18:05:00.000Z	Survivorman	ubuhackaa	I did
