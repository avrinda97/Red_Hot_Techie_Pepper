2007-04-06T11:07:00.000Z	greig__		billy : i cant thank you enough mate!! thanksssssss
2007-04-06T11:07:00.000Z	billy	greig__	I'll tell you how I fixed it.
2007-04-06T11:07:00.000Z	billy	greig__	it was simple, so I'll explain it.
2007-04-06T11:08:00.000Z	billy	greig__	you're fdisc -l indicated that linux was on partitions 2 and 3.  you said "not 3" so I went with partition 2.  are you looking at your menu.lst?
2007-04-06T11:08:00.000Z	billy	greig__	it's easier to see it by `cat /boot/grub/menu.lst` in terminal.
2007-04-06T11:09:00.000Z	billy	greig__	scroll down to End Default options, where the kernels are listed.
2007-04-06T11:10:00.000Z	billy	greig__	where it says "root" for each line, that's where /root is.  since it's the second partition on the first hard disk, it's (hd0,1).  number starts from 0, so the second is 1.
2007-04-06T11:11:00.000Z	billy	greig__	in the "kernel" line, there's another "root" line, which locates it a bit differently, by /dev/sda? location.  since it's the second, it's /dev/sda2.  that's all I changed.
2007-04-06T11:12:00.000Z	billy	greig__	so it's just a matter of knowing what to look for.  now ~you~ know.
2007-04-06T11:12:00.000Z	billy	greig__	I'm glad to help, mate.
2007-04-06T11:12:00.000Z	billy	greig__	did windows show up OK?
2007-04-06T11:13:00.000Z	billy	greig__	Oh, you didn't have windows.  sorry.
2007-04-06T12:39:00.000Z	billy	greig__	wassup.
2007-04-06T12:41:00.000Z	billy	greig__	a little.  why, what's up?
2007-04-06T12:45:00.000Z	billy	greig__	 well, it's looking at the wrong partition for windows.  is windows on hda4 or hda5?
2007-04-06T12:47:00.000Z	billy	greig__	well you could try both and see which works, i guess.  change the Widows XP title root line to (hd0,3).  that'll make it look at hda4.  to change it to look at five, change it to (hd0.4).  Understand what I'm saying?
2007-04-06T13:08:00.000Z	billy	greig__	 i changed it.
2007-04-06T13:10:00.000Z	billy	greig__	no.  i mean, I changed it again.  it's a different title this time.  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14260/
2007-04-06T13:11:00.000Z	billy	greig__	naw man.  I *just* posted it.
