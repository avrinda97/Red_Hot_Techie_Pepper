2009-11-02T09:25:00.000Z	niadh	LordHawke13	Yup
2009-11-02T09:26:00.000Z	LordHawke13	niadh	Some EXEs have sound, others don't. Do you have a lot of experience configuring the sound drivers?
2009-11-02T09:27:00.000Z	niadh	LordHawke13	Have you ran winecfg?
2009-11-02T09:27:00.000Z	LordHawke13	niadh	Nope. I'm relatively new to Linux in its entirety. Is that a comman I use in terminal?
2009-11-02T09:28:00.000Z	niadh	LordHawke13	You can use it in a terminal, however pressing ALT+F2 will bring up a command run dialog, just in case you don't like terminals, its like windows run
2009-11-02T09:30:00.000Z	LordHawke13	niadh	Oh. That. I went to Wine > Configure Wine and got it. I enabled all the audio drivers but some apps still don't gimme any sound.
2009-11-02T09:30:00.000Z	LordHawke13	niadh	One of the ones I was really hoping for was PowerTAB Editor. . .
2009-11-02T09:30:00.000Z	niadh	LordHawke13	The guitar tab program?
2009-11-02T09:30:00.000Z	LordHawke13	niadh	Si
2009-11-02T09:31:00.000Z	niadh	LordHawke13	Wine in my experience has had issues getting midi playback working
2009-11-02T09:31:00.000Z	LordHawke13	niadh	That explains why Guitar Pro won't work either. . . Doesn't it?
2009-11-02T09:32:00.000Z	niadh	LordHawke13	Doesn't it what?
2009-11-02T09:32:00.000Z	LordHawke13	niadh	Explain why Guitar Pro (PowerTAB that costs money) won't work.
2009-11-02T09:33:00.000Z	niadh	LordHawke13	No idea, I've just never had much luck with wine and midi, there might be a way, but i never found it
2009-11-02T09:33:00.000Z	LordHawke13	niadh	Are you on the new Karmic release?
2009-11-02T09:34:00.000Z	niadh	LordHawke13	Working on that, but i always have the latest wine
2009-11-02T09:35:00.000Z	LordHawke13	niadh	I noticed the "Share Screen" option in Empathy IM. It made me curious. Could you test that out with me?
2009-11-02T09:35:00.000Z	niadh	LordHawke13	Can try it, what network?
2009-11-02T09:36:00.000Z	niadh	LordHawke13	Neither have i
2009-11-02T09:37:00.000Z	LordHawke13	niadh	LAWL!
2009-11-02T09:39:00.000Z	niadh	LordHawke13	It uses some remote desktop protocal that i never got to work previously
