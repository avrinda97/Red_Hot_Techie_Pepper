2006-05-01T13:05:00.000Z	aaron__		how do i fix that?
2006-05-01T13:07:00.000Z	aaron__		one thing that seemed weird : when in fdisk and trying to delete partitions it first said pick 1-5
2006-05-01T13:08:00.000Z	aaron__		then after I deleted 1 of them, it said pick 1-4..But wouldnt delete them coz it said they were empty names or something
2006-05-01T13:08:00.000Z	aaron__		theres NOTHING on these
2006-05-01T13:09:00.000Z	aaron__		:/ a volunteer installed ubuntu earlier in the week and formatted all the drives during the install
2006-05-01T13:10:00.000Z	aaron__		hmm.. okay holy_cow...
2006-05-01T13:12:00.000Z	aaron__		i dunno.
2006-05-01T13:13:00.000Z	aaron__		i am setting up a lab of thin clients
2006-05-01T13:13:00.000Z	aaron__		but they cant boot from the network
2006-05-01T13:14:00.000Z	aaron__		so the instructions say to put something on the HD that will pull it over the network.. so
2006-05-01T13:14:00.000Z	sethk	aaron__	you shouldn't have to resort to using dd
2006-05-01T13:14:00.000Z	sethk	aaron__	if your hardware supports BOOTP, that's much easier.  Sometimes you need extra firmware on the NICs for bootp
2006-05-01T13:14:00.000Z	sethk	aaron__	or support in the BIOS
2006-05-01T13:15:00.000Z	sethk	aaron__	the thing with dd is a hack for machines that don't really support network boot
2006-05-01T13:15:00.000Z	sethk	aaron__	the thing is, any tiny detail will make that sort of hack not work
2006-05-01T13:15:00.000Z	sethk	aaron__	and unless you are good at the network bit level or have a hardware ethernet analyzer (or both), there isn't a lot you can do
2006-05-01T13:18:00.000Z	sethk	aaron__	well, that was easy.  :)
2006-05-01T13:19:00.000Z	sethk	aaron__	what did you do?
2006-05-01T13:19:00.000Z	sethk	aaron__	must be different firmware on that mobo (or it's a different mobo)
2006-05-01T13:19:00.000Z	sethk	aaron__	that's easy to set up
2006-05-01T13:19:00.000Z	sethk	aaron__	three minutes
2006-05-01T13:28:00.000Z	sethk	aaron__	the kids will love it.  they are too young to get intimidated by a little cli
