2007-01-05T07:27:00.000Z	cassidy		anyone know if the x1950 pro works with the new 8.32.5 drivers?
2007-01-05T07:28:00.000Z	pagefault	cassidy	if it does don't expect it to run very well
2007-01-05T07:28:00.000Z	cassidy	pagefault	can you get dri working with it?
2007-01-05T07:28:00.000Z	cassidy	pagefault	because i want to use xgl
2007-01-05T07:29:00.000Z	pagefault	cassidy	says x1900 series
2007-01-05T07:29:00.000Z	pagefault		so I would assume so
2007-01-05T07:30:00.000Z	cassidy	pagefault	are you still talking about with the new 8.32.5 drivers?
2007-01-05T07:30:00.000Z	pagefault	cassidy	yes
2007-01-05T07:30:00.000Z	cassidy	pagefault	well i cant get mine to run under ati for opengl, its saying that stupid mesa
2007-01-05T07:31:00.000Z	pagefault	cassidy	it will be very slow though because ati lacks the extension to accelerate it fast enough
2007-01-05T07:31:00.000Z	cassidy	pagefault	any way 3rd party drivers or something to get it running?
2007-01-05T07:31:00.000Z	pagefault		hmm
2007-01-05T07:31:00.000Z	pagefault	cassidy	not much you can do except buy an nvidia card :(
2007-01-05T07:33:00.000Z	pagefault		crossover office runs itunes the best but is a commercial product
2007-01-05T07:33:00.000Z	pagefault		you are better off with amarok or exile
2007-01-05T07:34:00.000Z	cassidy	pagefault	damn i like this card under windows....
2007-01-05T07:35:00.000Z	pagefault	cassidy	ati doesn't care about linux
2007-01-05T07:35:00.000Z	pagefault	cassidy	I had to switch from them because I got fed up
2007-01-05T07:36:00.000Z	cassidy	pagefault	well idk anymore then no need for linux with this card, cant run alot of apps very good
2007-01-05T07:36:00.000Z	pagefault	cassidy	their vista drivers are no better either which is sort of funny
2007-01-05T07:37:00.000Z	cassidy	pagefault	ya right now my card will play games in windows but like during half life 2 it keeps crashing, must be a bad model or something
2007-01-05T07:38:00.000Z	pagefault	cassidy	all you can hope for is AMD kicks their butt for linux support
