2004-10-31T13:36:00.000Z	calc	SuitsixX	as far as I know they have yet to release any 64bit drivers for linux
2004-10-31T13:36:00.000Z	calc	SuitsixX	it will be ok as long as it is 9200 or below

2004-10-31T14:12:00.000Z	calc	SuitsixX	why didn't they use optos 2.4's a bit more of a fair comparison?

2004-10-31T14:15:00.000Z	calc	SuitsixX	i haven't seen any non-biased benchmarks asserting that
2004-10-31T14:17:00.000Z	calc	SuitsixX	there are other non-speed related reasons for that though
