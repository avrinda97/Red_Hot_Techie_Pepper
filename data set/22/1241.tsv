2010-08-04T02:25:00.000Z	sharris		Hello, I installed ubuntu on my Alienware Area-51m laptop a few days ago and it keeps freezing up... So I tried ubuntu studio on it and I'm still having the os freezing, any ideas?

2010-08-04T09:49:00.000Z	sharris	ilovefairuz	here's the pastebin http://pastebin.com/Vxsr7zsw
2010-08-04T09:49:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	sharris	i'm looking into it
2010-08-04T09:55:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	sharris	i can't put my finger on anything in particular, but i suspect nouveau is the culprit, have you install the blob nvidia driver?
2010-08-04T09:56:00.000Z	sharris	ilovefairuz	i havent installed any drivers yet. I thought thats what the problem was when i had regular ubuntu installed
2010-08-04T09:57:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	sharris	well try the closed driver and see
2010-08-04T09:59:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	sharris	system > administration > hardware drivers
2010-08-04T10:00:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	sharris	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia has many tips if something went wrong
2010-08-04T10:00:00.000Z	sharris	ilovefairuz	i cant get to the desktop... it will freeze before i can do anything, that is if i can actually make it to the desktop before the freeze beats me to it :P
2010-08-04T10:01:00.000Z	sharris	ilovefairuz	im in recovery mode right now... only way i can run these commands, lol
2010-08-04T10:02:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	sharris	well then follow the commands in the 'common issues' section
2010-08-04T10:25:00.000Z	sharris	ilovefairuz	i updated the nvidia driver and now it's asking me to login as root... the ubuntu studio installer nerver asked me to setup a root password
2010-08-04T10:25:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	sharris	what's asking you to login as root?
2010-08-04T10:28:00.000Z	sharris	ilovefairuz	now it boots into "atudiolt login: _"
