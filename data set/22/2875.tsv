2009-02-08T09:30:00.000Z	wayStead		hey i installed ubuntu in virtualbox, and im having trouble getting it to use my native monitor resolution
2009-02-08T09:30:00.000Z	jero	wayStead	- mount the vboxadditions and install them. then all works
2009-02-08T09:31:00.000Z	jero	wayStead	- without the additions your mouse will be clumsy and the graphics slow, plus it wont autoadjust your resolution
2009-02-08T09:32:00.000Z	wayStead	jero	- thks
2009-02-08T09:39:00.000Z	wayStead	jero	- i am getting a "command not found" error when i tried to run the Vbox additions executable
2009-02-08T09:40:00.000Z	wayStead	jero	- i had to use sudo since it wanted to be run as admin
2009-02-08T09:40:00.000Z	jero	wayStead	- note the its VBo... with capital B
2009-02-08T09:40:00.000Z	wayStead	jero	- nvm i had to do ./VBox
2009-02-08T09:58:00.000Z	jero	wayStead	yes
2009-02-08T09:58:00.000Z	jero	wayStead	8.04 will run faster in it than 8.10
2009-02-08T10:00:00.000Z	jero	wayStead	You ll have to find out yourself i guess. doesnt take long to install anyway
2009-02-08T10:01:00.000Z	wayStead	jero	- do you think it will run better than ubuntu in vbox, im having perormance problems with ubuntu
2009-02-08T10:01:00.000Z	jero	wayStead	- which version of Ubuntu did you use, and what cpu is it?
2009-02-08T10:03:00.000Z	jero	wayStead	- then you want to use jeOS and do apt-get install Xorg, apt get install xdm, apt get install icewm  - jeOS 8.04 or 7.10 - 8.10 or 9.04 are SLOW!
2009-02-08T10:03:00.000Z	jero	wayStead	- also ubuntu 8.04 will be faster than 8.10
2009-02-08T10:05:00.000Z	wayStead	jero	- i dont get what u said about jeOS,. whats apt-get ?
2009-02-08T10:06:00.000Z	wayStead	jero	- i dont get what u said about jeOS,. whats apt-get ?
2009-02-08T10:06:00.000Z	jero	wayStead	- jeOS 8.04 is an about 100mb iso which installs a minimal system without any display manager/environment, but with network access . With apt-get install <package.deb> you can load your own packages and create a lightweight environment
2009-02-08T10:07:00.000Z	jero	wayStead	- the packages you need for a lightweight icewm environment i listed to you - Xorg , xdm, icewm - then reboot after you got those with sudo apt-get install
2009-02-08T10:11:00.000Z	wayStead	jero	- thks again for the help
2009-02-08T10:11:00.000Z	jero	wayStead	good luck with it, VMs are lots of fun
2009-02-08T10:11:00.000Z	jero	wayStead	and you can carry them with you on your next system OS independend
