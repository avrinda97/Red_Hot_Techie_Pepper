2012-03-04T22:37:00.000Z	lnxslck		my ubuntu doesn' show all ram memory, what could cause this?
2012-03-04T22:37:00.000Z	lnxslck		in windows it shows all 4gb
2012-03-04T22:37:00.000Z	lnxslck		MemFree:          161932 kB
2012-03-04T22:38:00.000Z	escott	lnxslck	the graphics card memory needs to be addressable so it grabs some of the 32bit memory space and hides your ram
2012-03-04T22:38:00.000Z	escott	lnxslck	you can lose upwards of 2gb of 32bit addressable space just for that
2012-03-04T22:40:00.000Z	escott	lnxslck	that is the physical ram addressable from userspace. since you have more ram and hardware addressable dma ram than you can address it is 4GB less the hardware DMA (mostly graphics card but others as well) less a little bit for the kernel itself
2012-03-04T22:41:00.000Z	lnxslck	escott	you would recomend moving up to ubuntu 64 bits?
2012-03-04T22:41:00.000Z	escott	lnxslck	yes
2012-03-04T22:41:00.000Z	escott	lnxslck	the alternative would be 32bit + pae but 64bit is better
2012-03-04T22:42:00.000Z	escott	lnxslck	you will have to reinstall (fyi when you go to 64bit it will show just a little bit less than 4gb because of the kernels usage)
2012-03-04T22:42:00.000Z	lnxslck	escott	i see
2012-03-04T22:43:00.000Z	lnxslck	escott	is ubuntu 64 working fine? no more issues with flash plugin and such?
2012-03-04T22:43:00.000Z	escott	lnxslck	on my 64bit system i loose 24*8 MB of ram to the kernel
2012-03-04T22:43:00.000Z	lnxslck	escott	that's a few
2012-03-04T22:44:00.000Z	escott	lnxslck	ive been happily using 64bit for years, never had serious issues, but things are a bit nicer with multiarch
2012-03-04T22:44:00.000Z	lnxslck	escott	multiarch? running 32 bits also on ubuntu 64?
2012-03-04T22:44:00.000Z	escott	lnxslck	http://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch in 11.10 and up
2012-03-04T22:46:00.000Z	lnxslck	escott	what programs do you use that require 32 bits ?
2012-03-04T22:46:00.000Z	escott	lnxslck	skype? im not even sure. i don't pay much attention to the split these days, which is how it should be
2012-03-04T22:47:00.000Z	lnxslck	escott	true
2012-03-04T22:47:00.000Z	lnxslck	escott	the same applications you have on ubuntu 32 bits you have on ubuntu 64 bits?
2012-03-04T22:48:00.000Z	escott	lnxslck	no i run 64bit. but if there is something that is 32bit its trivial to install it these days
