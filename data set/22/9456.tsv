2005-01-29T17:43:00.000Z	ollie		anyone know what ubuntu's schedule is for pulling stuff from debian?  I'm wondering if the recently released alsa-1.0.8 has a chance of making it into hoary.
2005-01-29T17:43:00.000Z	crimsun	ollie	it will sync when the devs have time.
2005-01-29T17:43:00.000Z	crimsun	ollie	because it's a ubuntu merge, it requires manual adjustment.
2005-01-29T17:44:00.000Z	crimsun	ollie	which chipset?
2005-01-29T17:45:00.000Z	ollie	crimsun	it's a Sound Blaster Audigy -- I don't know the chipset (not much of a hardware guy -- just want to listen to tunes ;-))
2005-01-29T17:45:00.000Z	crimsun	ollie	that was actually supported way back in 1.0.4
2005-01-29T17:46:00.000Z	crimsun	ollie	it is supported.
2005-01-29T17:46:00.000Z	ollie	crimsun	really?  what do I have to do -- my system doesn't detect the card.
2005-01-29T17:47:00.000Z	ollie	crimsun	could it be the Audigy LS is different from some other Audigy?
2005-01-29T17:47:00.000Z	crimsun	ollie	extremely different.
2005-01-29T17:48:00.000Z	crimsun	ollie	it's crippled hardware, per creative's usual marketing tactics.
2005-01-29T17:50:00.000Z	crimsun	ollie	you need 1.0.6 or newer with the ca0106 driver.
2005-01-29T17:51:00.000Z	crimsun	ollie	but for stable functionality, you need 1.0.7 or newer.
2005-01-29T17:52:00.000Z	ollie	crimsun	perhaps a silly question, but is there any way to get ubuntu to auto detect it?
2005-01-29T17:53:00.000Z	crimsun	ollie	no, because it's not currently enabled for Hoary.
2005-01-29T17:53:00.000Z	ollie	crimsun	ok
2005-01-29T17:57:00.000Z	ollie	crimsun	any tips on how to go about getting it working?  will I need to compile a new kernel, etc...?
2005-01-29T17:57:00.000Z	crimsun	ollie	no, you need to compile a alsa-modules deb
2005-01-29T17:58:00.000Z	crimsun	ollie	sudo aptitude install alsa-source build-essential kernel-package linux-headers-$(uname -r); more /usr/share/doc/alsa-source/README.Debian
2005-01-29T17:58:00.000Z	ollie	crimsun	thanks a bunch
2005-01-31T10:37:00.000Z	crimsun	ollie	'apache-utils'
2005-01-31T10:37:00.000Z	crimsun	ollie	note it's for 1.3.x
