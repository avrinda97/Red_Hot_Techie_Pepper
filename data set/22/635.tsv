2012-04-06T19:04:00.000Z	jrib	MarKsaitis	it was hard, but I think I found your actual question.  What ubuntu version?
2012-04-06T19:04:00.000Z	MarKsaitis	jrib	11.10 :)
2012-04-06T19:05:00.000Z	jrib	MarKsaitis	autoremove /should/ work.  But if it's not, you can just purge apache2.2-common
2012-04-06T19:05:00.000Z	MarKsaitis	jrib	I have found it as well. Everything is ok. Some of experts here don't know what theyr talking themselves. apt-get remove apache2 doesnt actually remove it, thats a fact and it is documented on the internet. Dunno why some people try to call me fool if I say that I dont agree with them
2012-04-06T19:06:00.000Z	MarKsaitis	jrib	yeah, apache2.2-common did the trick
2012-04-06T19:06:00.000Z	jrib	MarKsaitis	ok, glad you solved your issue.
2012-04-06T19:49:00.000Z	jrib	MarKsaitis	if you want to learn about upstart, you should read the upstart cookbook at: upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook
2012-04-06T19:27:00.000Z	jrib	MarKsaitis	also, is this a different system than the one you were purging apache from earlier?  You told me you were on 11.10 a few minutes ago
2012-04-06T19:27:00.000Z	MarKsaitis	jrib	it was 11.10
2012-04-06T19:27:00.000Z	jrib	MarKsaitis	and what version are you on now?
2012-04-06T19:31:00.000Z	jrib	MarKsaitis	there's an upstart job that's responsible for running the sysv scripts (on ubuntu anyway)
2012-04-06T19:31:00.000Z	MarKsaitis	jrib	ok. Which one is it?
2012-04-06T19:32:00.000Z	jrib	MarKsaitis	rc
2012-04-06T19:32:00.000Z	MarKsaitis	jrib	it exists and looks normal, but probably doesnt work
2012-04-06T19:35:00.000Z	jrib	MarKsaitis	well that's not supposed to happen :)
2012-04-06T19:36:00.000Z	MarKsaitis	jrib	runlevel:/var/run/utmp: No such file or directory  search tells me that it is an upgrade bug
2012-04-06T19:36:00.000Z	jrib	MarKsaitis	what's the result of « uname -r »?
2012-04-06T19:38:00.000Z	jrib	MarKsaitis	there are two issues: 1) that's not an ubuntu kernel and 2) that's not a version of the kernel available on 11.10
2012-04-06T19:52:00.000Z	jrib	MarKsaitis	the runlevel does return a runlevel; you know this because MonkeyDust answered you earlier.  The reason yours does not work is likely related to the fact that you are using a non-ubuntu kernel.  My advice is to ask for support from the vendor providing you with said kernel
2012-04-06T19:53:00.000Z	MarKsaitis	jrib	might be true
2012-04-06T19:59:00.000Z	jrib	MarKsaitis	they aren't broken; that site is actually just complaining about a debian decision to make runlevels 2-5 identical (which is a design decision; they work as intended by the developers)
2012-04-06T20:00:00.000Z	jrib	MarKsaitis	I think contacting your vendor is what you should do now; we cannot help you further
