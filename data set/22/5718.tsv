2007-03-14T12:24:00.000Z	chuck`_		Is there a good online resource for themes/interfaces for ubuntu (a la win32 programs like WindowBlinds or ThemeXP)?  i want a more "slick" look to my OS and I don't know where to start
2007-03-14T12:25:00.000Z	afflux	chuck`_	using gnome or KDE?
2007-03-14T12:26:00.000Z	afflux	chuck`_	they do the same
2007-03-14T12:26:00.000Z	chuck`_	afflux	gnome, but I don't know if I should just try getting a theme for gnome or change window managers to somethign a little "cooler"
2007-03-14T12:26:00.000Z	afflux	chuck`_	in case youre using gnome, there is a quite nice website: http://www.gnome-look.org/
2007-03-14T12:26:00.000Z	chuck`_	afflux	I used blackbox some years back and that looked rather sexy
2007-03-14T12:27:00.000Z	afflux	chuck`_	gnome is good enough, I think
2007-03-14T12:28:00.000Z	afflux	chuck`_	I liked the tiling window manager (larswm) but think this won't look as good, but is quite useful, if you get used to it
2007-03-14T12:28:00.000Z	chuck`_	afflux	do you have a link where I can read up on it further?
2007-03-14T12:29:00.000Z	afflux	chuck`_	until now only a german one... I'm searching
2007-03-14T12:30:00.000Z	afflux	chuck`_	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larswm
2007-03-14T12:31:00.000Z	afflux	chuck`_	it's very minimalistic, windows don't have a title bar. you have to move them via some keyboard action
2007-03-14T12:32:00.000Z	chuck`_	afflux	ah, I'm not sure I'd like doing that... this box is going to be a server so I don't really need the eye candy but I'd like it anyways.  but since it _is_ going to be a server I don't think moving windows would be much of a problem but it might get annoying
2007-03-14T12:33:00.000Z	afflux	chuck`_	I see ;)
2007-03-14T12:36:00.000Z	afflux	chuck`_	yes. for larswm you need to create a file for this
2007-03-14T12:44:00.000Z	chuck`_	afflux	on this gnome-look.org website should I be browsing through the GTK categories if I want themes for all my windows and such?
2007-03-14T12:44:00.000Z	chuck`_	afflux	since I'm using gnome and not one of these other window managers in the list
2007-03-14T12:45:00.000Z	afflux	chuck`_	I think you'll need gtk for buttons and stuff, and metacity for window decorations and icons
2007-03-14T12:51:00.000Z	chuck`_	afflux	so I assume I just have to extract these metacity tarballs somewhere right?  nothing to install?
2007-03-14T12:51:00.000Z	afflux	chuck`_	I'm not sure, wait 2 mins please
2007-03-14T12:52:00.000Z	afflux	chuck`_	no, click on system -> settings -> themes and click on "install themes", choose the tarball there
2007-03-14T12:52:00.000Z	chuck`_	afflux	Ah.  duh, OK.  thanks :)
