2011-07-26T17:36:00.000Z	emmkai		hey guys, i want to install "openssh-server"
2011-07-26T17:36:00.000Z	emmkai		how do i do it ?
2011-07-26T17:37:00.000Z	fmauro	emmkai	open a terminal and type sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2011-07-26T17:53:00.000Z	fmauro	emmkai	are you talking about connecting from outside of your LAN=
2011-07-26T17:54:00.000Z	emmkai	fmauro	yes
2011-07-26T17:54:00.000Z	fmauro	emmkai	if you want that you will have to do 2 things: know your WAN ip (whatismyip.com) 2. what llutz said
2011-07-26T17:56:00.000Z	fmauro	emmkai	much safer that way yes
2011-07-27T01:01:00.000Z	fmauro	emmkai	OpenVPN has nice guides on their website
2011-07-27T01:03:00.000Z	emmkai	fmauro	do i have to buy some service for my VPN ?
2011-07-27T01:03:00.000Z	fmauro	emmkai	no
2011-07-27T01:05:00.000Z	fmauro	emmkai	One of them has to, and if you're trying to access it from outside a NAT it is even a bit more complicated. but they have HOW-TOs on the site for all of that
2011-07-27T01:06:00.000Z	emmkai	fmauro	finally i found it, stupid website layout !
2011-07-27T01:06:00.000Z	fmauro	emmkai	also check if your router doesn't already provide some sort of VPN capability, might save you some time
2011-07-27T01:07:00.000Z	emmkai	fmauro	the server will either be connected to a router or a 3G dongle
2011-07-27T01:07:00.000Z	fmauro	emmkai	you mean both machines are volatile? both change places all the time?
2011-07-27T01:08:00.000Z	fmauro	emmkai	If possible I would suggest setting the static one as server
2011-07-27T01:09:00.000Z	emmkai	fmauro	it might be like that in some cases that they will both be volatile, but i'd hope the each 3-4 weak session, the server will be static
2011-07-27T01:10:00.000Z	fmauro	emmkai	I take it this is to establish ssh connectivity to the outside, or do you need other services as well?
2011-07-27T01:11:00.000Z	fmauro	emmkai	Is this for private or corporate use? (I ask concerning the severity of a security breach)
2011-07-27T01:12:00.000Z	fmauro	emmkai	okay, if you feel safe enough you can also do the following:
2011-07-27T01:14:00.000Z	fmauro	emmkai	Set up your static machines Router (or the machine itself) to update a dyndns account so you have a static hostname to the outside world. then you set up ssh as to only accept the public key of your portable machine + password. this way no-one other than you on your machine can access
2011-07-27T01:16:00.000Z	fmauro	emmkai	good luck man. I'm outta here.
