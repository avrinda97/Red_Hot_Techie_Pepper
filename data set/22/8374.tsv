2005-08-30T07:01:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	sorry, I didn't follow all, but what errors do you get? (so what's your prob)
2005-08-30T07:02:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	if you have a digital camera, take pictures :-)
2005-08-30T07:03:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	so you have trouble installing Ubuntu? Or do you have trouble with the partitioning part?
2005-08-30T07:05:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	that's the problem when I just join in ;-)
2005-08-30T07:06:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	just type them in a text editor and then dump them to pastebin :D
2005-08-30T07:06:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	but by now you should've defined the problem? 1. Does partioning work? 2. Does it install all? ...
2005-08-30T07:08:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	partitioning = good (that's good). Install went OK (great). Gnome won't boot. Is that your only problem?
2005-08-30T07:08:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	did you ever think it could be a corrupt CD? (happened to me once)
2005-08-30T07:09:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	you could also download the Ultimate Boot CD (UBCD) and use the harddisk tools to check your HD and run Memtest (Just to be sure) or even a CPU burnin test :D
2005-08-30T07:10:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	if you're on windows, just use Nero (or something) to burn the Ubuntu CD and then select "verify written data" (or something like that)
2005-08-30T07:11:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	wait
2005-08-30T07:12:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	FIRST get the Ultimate boot cd.... and burn it!
2005-08-30T07:12:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	and maybe Knoppix too. Just to be sure
2005-08-30T07:12:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	if something happens, Testdisk (UBCD) could save your behind and Knoppix could help you partition :D (it's faster than Ubuntu live CD :P)
2005-08-30T07:13:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	I just want to give you a couple of pointers (things you should look out for). You'll never know
2005-08-30T07:14:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	A friend of mine had install probs with Windows XP. The RAM was bad (wrong slot, so many many errors)
2005-08-30T07:15:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	I also have a SATA drive (2nd or 3rd HD). Works like a charm :-)
2005-08-30T07:15:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	SATA isn't faster, only smaller cables
2005-08-30T07:16:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	Memtest could take up to 24-hours to run all the tests! I always do that when I get a new PC, checking everything so I don't regret it later on
2005-08-30T07:16:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	UBCD is better. And it's proven
2005-08-30T07:46:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	you still there?
2005-08-30T07:47:00.000Z	blaat	DjKritical	one more thing. What kind of graphics card do you have??? (I think it was a Geforce 6800 problem, that Gnome wasn't booting). You'll need to search ubuntuforums.org
