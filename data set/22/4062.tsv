2012-04-19T05:46:00.000Z	crackerjackz		i'm trying to figure out what is on /dev/sda3 but it won't let me mount it. when i try to mount /dev/sda3 to /mnt/sda3 it says that i must specify a filesystem type
2012-04-19T05:46:00.000Z	wylde	crackerjackz	what's the output of 'sudo fdisk -l'
2012-04-19T05:47:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wylde	i have 5 partitions.. windows xp is on sda1, ubuntu on sda2, then i have a partition on sda5 for my files... i can't figure out what is on sda3 though
2012-04-19T05:48:00.000Z	wylde	crackerjackz	pastebin the output please.
2012-04-19T05:48:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wylde	kind of hard to paste it because im on a different computer but hold on
2012-04-19T05:49:00.000Z	wylde	crackerjackz	well at any rate if it told you the fs is ntfs then you'll need this bot factoid. !ntfs

2012-04-19T05:52:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wylde	but /dev/sda1 is an NTFS file system and it mounts its self automatically
2012-04-19T05:53:00.000Z	wylde	crackerjackz	ok, what command are you trying to use to mount it? (and I assume you made an empty directory to mount into)
2012-04-19T05:53:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wylde	im about to format /dev/sda3 but i want to make sure there is nothing important on it first
2012-04-19T05:54:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wylde	sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/sda3
2012-04-19T05:54:00.000Z	wylde	crackerjackz	sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/sda3 -t ntfs

2012-04-19T05:58:00.000Z	wylde	crackerjackz	hmmm..
2012-04-19T05:59:00.000Z	wylde	crackerjackz	quite possible
2012-04-19T05:59:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wylde	i have no idea what is on sda3
2012-04-19T06:00:00.000Z	wylde	crackerjackz	neither do I, and it doesn't look like it's going to be easy to find out either.
2012-04-19T06:00:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wylde	it says it is 2996122+ blocks.. how many gb is that?
2012-04-19T06:02:00.000Z	wylde	crackerjackz	2GB maybe? could have been your swap partition at some point
2012-04-19T06:04:00.000Z	wylde	crackerjackz	it's probably an old swap partition that you did "something" to lol
2012-04-19T06:04:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wylde	oh well what ever it was its gone now.. i deleted it
2012-06-10T11:04:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wylde	excellent, it worked ty
