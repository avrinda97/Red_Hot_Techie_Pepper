2009-05-26T03:33:00.000Z	d0t		can anyone help me with my ssh server..  please tell me if the configuration is bad.. sshd_conf: http://pastebin.com/d36bc9c2f and ssh_conf: http://pastebin.com/d478bab29
2009-05-26T03:34:00.000Z	skyl	d0t	why would not the default work after grabbing with the package manager?
2009-05-26T03:36:00.000Z	d0t	skyl	i don't know apparently there's no respond to clients when people want to connect as well as a problem when i want to connect it says access denied after the password sequence
2009-05-26T03:47:00.000Z	skyl	d0t	it should work with no configuration.  It is probably an IPtables or other firewall issue
2009-05-26T03:49:00.000Z	skyl	d0t	check $ sudo iptables -L (iirc) and see if you are ACCEPT from all ...
2009-05-26T03:52:00.000Z	d0t	skyl	http://pastebin.com/m1596638e
2009-05-26T03:55:00.000Z	skyl	d0t	I'm no iptables expert but I think that   ... ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:ssh  should mean that you are open to traffic on 22
2009-05-26T04:02:00.000Z	d0t	skyl	please ssh if you can on port 443 let's see if it's open
2009-05-26T04:03:00.000Z	skyl	d0t	I don't know your ip or anything
2009-05-26T04:04:00.000Z	skyl	d0t	but that might yield unexpected behavior as that is the ssl http port usually
2009-05-26T04:08:00.000Z	d0t	skyl	Ampelbein, my ip to ssh 41.241.212.226 please..
2009-05-26T04:08:00.000Z	skyl	d0t	http://articles.slicehost.com/2008/11/28/ubuntu-intrepid-setup-page-1 that is kind of some of the things I do when setting up a machine.  it is a bit different as they are assuming a slicehost install ... I will try though
2009-05-26T04:09:00.000Z	skyl	d0t	nope, I think that it is a firewall issue
2009-05-26T04:10:00.000Z	skyl	d0t	also, you might need to restart the sshd server?  if you have made changes to config and have not..
2009-05-26T04:11:00.000Z	d0t	skyl	yeas i forwarded fine.. (with windows VNC it works good..)
2009-05-26T04:11:00.000Z	skyl	d0t	by all means log into your router and forward the ports though ... hmmm...
2009-05-26T04:13:00.000Z	d0t	skyl	i swear to god i did :)
2009-05-26T04:13:00.000Z	d0t	skyl	give me a port to forward and i will even print screen for you :P
2009-05-26T04:14:00.000Z	skyl	d0t	flush your iptables so that iptables -L gives you three lines that all say accept... use default ssh config (if you can get back there) forward port 22... done ..
2009-05-26T04:16:00.000Z	skyl	d0t	then you can go back and learn iptables if you want some custom blockage and use that article to change your ssh port to something else later too
2009-05-26T04:19:00.000Z	d0t	skyl	http://pastebin.com/m6f5bdf00 <-- flushed tables.
2009-05-26T04:22:00.000Z	d0t	skyl	i see no accept there..
