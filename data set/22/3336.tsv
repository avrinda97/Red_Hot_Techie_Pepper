2008-11-04T05:12:00.000Z	imchrislabeard	ActionParsnip	that didn't fix it
2008-11-04T05:12:00.000Z	imchrislabeard	ActionParsnip	it says abunch of garbage about like ?text_poke_early+0x52/0x70 etc..
2008-11-04T05:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imchrislabeard	you need to edit the boot option for the kernel with Press the F6 key to select Other Options. Then add noacpi dma=no

2008-11-04T05:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imchrislabeard	of course you can , the keyboard is captured
2008-11-04T05:16:00.000Z	imchrislabeard	ActionParsnip	it won't let me it keeps bringing up the dashboard
2008-11-04T05:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imchrislabeard	if its a virtual system you boot to the host OS
2008-11-04T05:19:00.000Z	imchrislabeard	ActionParsnip	for some reason its not capturing my keyboard on those keys
