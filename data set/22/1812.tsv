2010-01-07T18:51:00.000Z	Xfact	MASARUwota	sorry I meant that connect your modem and CPU via an ethernet cable...
2010-01-07T18:52:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Xfact	CPU = central processing unit, your processor. you dont connect that to the internet afaik
2010-01-07T18:52:00.000Z	Xfact	MASARUwota	only that calbe doing all problem to my Ubuntu 9.10 so I am feeling helpless :(
2010-01-07T18:52:00.000Z	Xfact	MASARUwota	whatever, that big side box....which we use and 'normally call CPU'
2010-01-07T18:53:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Xfact	what? :/ Computer, or PC? is that what you are aiming at?
2010-01-07T18:55:00.000Z	Xfact	MASARUwota	and akanyicy, yes that computer desktop box....
2010-01-07T18:55:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Xfact	you dont call it a CPU, honestly, you dont :/
2010-01-07T18:57:00.000Z	Xfact	MASARUwota	then what should I call it?
2010-01-07T18:58:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Xfact	pc, desktop, computer, "box"    just dont call it CPU, as a CPU is something INSIDE a computer :/
2010-01-07T19:00:00.000Z	Xfact	MASARUwota	but which you are meaning CPU I mean it by calling 'processor'  :)
2010-01-07T19:01:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Xfact	you may think that, but you should use words that the general public uses. im not just going to use random words because i like them :/
2010-01-15T14:57:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Xfact	jiggling around with compiz?
2010-01-15T15:03:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Xfact	?
2010-01-15T15:03:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Xfact	i think explaining how LINUX works, instead of moving around with compiz windows, is more usefull.  imho
