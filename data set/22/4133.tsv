2010-09-18T14:42:00.000Z	sahil		i can not believe you guys are talking about the rt3090
2010-09-18T14:42:00.000Z	chelz	sahil	is that why you're here?
2010-09-18T14:42:00.000Z	sahil	chelz	I have read tons of forums on this very issue tonight
2010-09-18T14:43:00.000Z	chelz	sahil	we're currently trying a ppa
2010-09-18T14:43:00.000Z	sahil	chelz	I was going to build something similar
2010-09-18T14:43:00.000Z	chelz	sahil	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:markus-tisoft/rt3090
2010-09-18T14:43:00.000Z	chelz	sahil	sudo apt-get install rt3090-dkms
2010-09-18T14:43:00.000Z	chelz		is what i'd say you should try
2010-09-18T14:43:00.000Z	sahil	chelz	question is isn't there support for rt3090 in the kernel?
2010-09-18T14:43:00.000Z	chelz	sahil	no idea
2010-09-18T14:44:00.000Z	chelz	sahil	i would guess not
2010-09-18T14:44:00.000Z	sahil	chelz	from my reading there is...
2010-09-18T14:44:00.000Z	sahil		integrated with the rt2860pci driver-I was going to compile a kernel with it working
2010-09-18T14:46:00.000Z	sahil	chelz	if the kernel didn't work i was going to follow the howto build the RaLink guide and build a deb
2010-09-18T14:46:00.000Z	chelz	sahil	eh well you could try the ppa first. should be quick test.
2010-09-18T14:47:00.000Z	sahil	chelz	ppa is fine but i'm interested in this for two reason-i sell these laptops to customers so i need a longterm solution
2010-09-18T14:47:00.000Z	chelz	sahil	make sure maverick gets support for it then get a package for it released in lucid-backports
2010-09-18T14:48:00.000Z	sahil		chelz:im concerned about maverick not lucid
2010-09-18T14:48:00.000Z	chelz	sahil	or maverick is frozen actually, so maybe make sure natty gets it
2010-09-18T14:48:00.000Z	chelz	sahil	LTS releases have a much longer support lifecycle than normal releases, depending on who your customers are it might be better to keep them on LTS releases
2010-09-18T14:49:00.000Z	sahil	chelz	desktop-endusers -they're laptops
2010-09-18T14:49:00.000Z	chelz	sahil	eh well for lucid users i sure hope it get a backport
