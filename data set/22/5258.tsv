2007-06-07T05:53:00.000Z	talmid	gnomefreak	this computer was upraded to gutsy by accident just when it came out. The person when he noticed change the rep to feisty. A few things are broken and I am trying to downgrade the whole system to feisty
2007-06-07T05:53:00.000Z	talmid	gnomefreak	I'll pastebin my pin file
2007-06-07T05:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	talmid	reinstall
2007-06-07T05:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	talmid	pinning wont help you
2007-06-07T05:55:00.000Z	talmid	gnomefreak	I am a old debian user. I am actually interested to see what I am doing wrong with my pin file. do you mind have a quick look at it?
2007-06-07T05:56:00.000Z	gnomefreak	talmid	i cant atm im a bit busy but someone in here should beable to. i doubt its you. there is no way to downgrade safely or a way that works at all afaik
2007-06-07T05:59:00.000Z	talmid	gnomefreak	I am going to reinstall. It is just that such a pin file would have worked in debian I am wondering why it doesn't work in ubuntu. Did ubuntu do anything to break it?
2007-06-07T06:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	talmid	i dont think its anything but gutsy that is messing it up.
2007-06-07T06:01:00.000Z	talmid	gnomefreak	what do you mean?
2007-06-07T06:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	talmid	gutsy is broken anything could be causing it. im in the middle of working atm i dont see anything wrong with thte file from what i remember please ask the channel im a bit busy atm (gutsy may not be reading the file correctly hence gutsy is broken
2007-06-07T06:06:00.000Z	talmid	gnomefreak	I see. Nothing is actually broken with this system any more (just fixed it). I manually downgraded the lib that was causing the problem. thank you. I try and debug the problem quickly then reinstall the box.
2007-06-07T06:07:00.000Z	talmid	gnomefreak	this box has actually been upgraded from debian warty all way to ubuntu gutsy without any problems.

2007-06-07T06:11:00.000Z	talmid	gnomefreak	heh apt all its related software are the feisty version. This box wasn't updating to gutsy for very long.
