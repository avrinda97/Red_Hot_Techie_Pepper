2007-05-06T08:15:00.000Z	bruenig		well from this channel, it is considerably higher
2007-05-06T08:16:00.000Z	bruenig		!repeat | hey lindsey5252
2007-05-06T08:16:00.000Z	lindsey5252	bruenig	nobody knows my answer then huh?
2007-05-06T08:17:00.000Z	bruenig	lindsey5252	appears that way, at the very least rapid repetition is not called for
2007-05-06T08:17:00.000Z	lindsey5252	bruenig	yeah i don't usually repeat, just in this channel i noticed a lot of users
2007-05-06T08:17:00.000Z	lindsey5252	bruenig	and someone could easily miss it
2007-05-06T08:18:00.000Z	lindsey5252	bruenig	look at berent
2007-05-06T08:18:00.000Z	lindsey5252	bruenig	that's too much
2007-05-06T08:18:00.000Z	bruenig	lindsey5252	the "lot of users" is precisely why you don't want to repeat because you flood the channel which is what makes it hard to read in the first place
2007-05-06T08:18:00.000Z	lindsey5252	bruenig	i just repeated after two minutes, i wouldn't consider it flooding
2007-05-06T08:19:00.000Z	bruenig	lindsey5252	oh I wasn't checking time, I just saw them both on my screen at the same time
2007-05-06T08:19:00.000Z	lindsey5252	bruenig	you must have your window enlarged :P
2007-05-06T08:21:00.000Z	lindsey5252	bruenig	the mount point for cdrom is /media/cdrom right?
2007-05-06T08:21:00.000Z	lindsey5252	bruenig	or is it /mnt/cdrom
2007-05-06T08:21:00.000Z	bruenig	lindsey5252	not sure on feisty, in edgy it was /media/cdrom, but if you are mounting from iso, you can put it wherever you want
2007-05-06T08:22:00.000Z	lindsey5252	bruenig	yeah this installer searches for a disc, that's why i need to know where it is by default. hmm
2007-05-06T08:22:00.000Z	lindsey5252	bruenig	i guess /media/cdrom didn't work and neither did /mnt/cdrom :/
2007-05-06T08:22:00.000Z	bruenig	lindsey5252	actually I am thinking that /dev/cdrom is a symlink to /dev/cdrom0 or /dev/cdrom1 or something like that
2007-05-06T08:23:00.000Z	lindsey5252	bruenig	can i do a mount -o loop on a /dev/cdrom ?
2007-05-06T08:23:00.000Z	bruenig	lindsey5252	you probably need to tell wine where it is, maybe winecfg has that option
2007-05-06T08:23:00.000Z	lindsey5252	bruenig	hmm
2007-05-06T08:23:00.000Z	bruenig	lindsey5252	I meant /media in all of those not /dev
