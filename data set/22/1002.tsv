2011-07-12T11:27:00.000Z	crackerjackz		how come fdisk -l only list my flash drive?
2011-07-12T11:29:00.000Z	crackerjackz		thats so bizzare
2011-07-12T11:29:00.000Z	crackerjackz		its not detecting the harddrive any more... i'm in the bios right now.. it says onboard sata hard drive not present
2011-07-12T11:30:00.000Z	wabznasm	crackerjackz	you rechecked connectors and cables? I have a dodgy sata that disappears if I so much as look at it a bit funny
2011-07-12T11:30:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wabznasm	i'm about to check it now
2011-07-12T11:31:00.000Z	wabznasm	crackerjackz	mine actually ended up dying. so if things seem okay, but you get intermittent probs still, get it backed up
2011-07-12T11:38:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wabznasm	ahh i was wrong the bios does detect the hard drive it appears my HD is abunch of random letters and numbers
2011-07-12T11:38:00.000Z	wabznasm	crackerjackz	that does not sound good :(
2011-07-12T11:39:00.000Z	wabznasm	crackerjackz	less reason for panicking then...
2011-07-12T11:40:00.000Z	wabznasm	crackerjackz	random numbers and letters are your serial code for your SeaGate drive (IIRC)
2011-07-12T11:40:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wabznasm	i see
2011-07-12T11:40:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wabznasm	so how come my hard drive wont show up when i fdisk -l from dsl
2011-07-12T11:41:00.000Z	wabznasm	crackerjackz	difficult to say for sure. Before my sata bit the dust, I got lots of error messages in dmesg - anything there that looks nasty?
2011-07-12T11:43:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wabznasm	i dunno i can't pastebin it i cant get net
2011-07-12T11:43:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wabznasm	what kind of errors should i look for in dmesg?
2011-07-12T11:45:00.000Z	wabznasm	crackerjackz	errors prefixed sataX, hard resetting link, link down, reset failed. Ugly stuff that doesn't sound good. Hoipefully you won't
2011-07-12T11:45:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wabznasm	VFS: can't find ex2 filesystem on dev sd(8,1).
2011-07-12T11:46:00.000Z	wabznasm	crackerjackz	a gioolge search shows some results for that which might be worth reading
2011-07-12T11:47:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wabznasm	well the error im getting is grub rescue invald filesystem... i found this but, this guide isn't going to work unless i can see my partitons
2011-07-12T11:49:00.000Z	wabznasm	crackerjackz	so you've booted with a live cd (I didn't read any previous messages of yours) is thatright?
2011-07-12T11:50:00.000Z	crackerjackz	wabznasm	i booted into damn small linux with a usb flash drive.. when i run the command fdisk -l it doesn't show my hard drive.. none of my partitions show up
2011-07-12T12:51:00.000Z	wabznasm	crackerjackz	:wq
