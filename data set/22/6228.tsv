2006-11-28T13:28:00.000Z	misiu_mp	VigoFusion	i use open source drivers, so it doesnt apply
2006-11-28T13:30:00.000Z	VigoFusion	misiu_mp	They are propietary, but they are at least working with Open Source.
2006-11-28T13:32:00.000Z	misiu_mp	VigoFusion	No i use the open source 'ati' or 'radeon' driver, supported by the community. not the proprietary written by ati
2006-11-28T13:33:00.000Z	VigoFusion	misiu_mp	I cannot , or do not have the Linux know how to get mine working, I am stuck with 800x600 reso , its kinda frustrateing. But its a learning experiance, so its fun.
2006-11-28T13:35:00.000Z	misiu_mp	VigoFusion	mine is working just fine except for the video overlay. i have an r200 (8500) chip
2006-11-28T13:38:00.000Z	VigoFusion	misiu_mp	Would you or may I ask you to assist me in getting my Xpress 200 series to function? This #channel is obviously not the place, but I am linuxly challenged. :-$
2006-11-28T13:40:00.000Z	misiu_mp	VigoFusion	so you want to run the proprietary drivers? Did you follow the instructions on th ubuntu site?
2006-11-28T13:41:00.000Z	VigoFusion	misiu_mp	Not yet, I am slow, I looked at them all and bkmarked, but have yet to do any installs as it looks quite complicated.
2006-11-28T13:43:00.000Z	misiu_mp	VigoFusion	This one seems to be the one you should start with: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI. I think you should manage. Just follow the instructions. Its like making a cake.
2006-11-28T13:43:00.000Z	VigoFusion	misiu_mp	Thank you kindly
2006-11-28T13:47:00.000Z	misiu_mp	VigoFusion	if it wont help you could change the /etc/X11/xorg.conf so that in Section "Screen", subsection "Display" all Modes start with your desired resolution
2006-11-28T13:48:00.000Z	misiu_mp	VigoFusion	you should know what im talking about when you open and look at the file
2006-11-28T13:50:00.000Z	VigoFusion	misiu_mp	This new page on the forums says that the fix is to not use fglrx, the Binary Pages says use fglrx, hrmm, I will try it again, Thank you.
2006-11-28T14:25:00.000Z	VigoFusion	misiu_mp	YAY! worked like a CHARM! Thank you Thank you! :)
2006-11-28T14:26:00.000Z	misiu_mp	VigoFusion	Happy to have helped you
2006-11-28T14:28:00.000Z	VigoFusion	misiu_mp	My error was not doing the Ctrl-Alt-Bckspace to save and reconfig.
2006-11-28T14:30:00.000Z	misiu_mp	VigoFusion	heh, the most annoying errors are the ones needing simplest solutions. It can be dissapointing to find out about a simple fix after hours of annoyance.
