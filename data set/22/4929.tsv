2007-11-17T22:35:00.000Z	talcite		hey guys, is there any way to view all the shortcuts for the compiz-fusion effects?
2007-11-17T22:36:00.000Z	talcite		I used to have a beryl manager when I was using that... but well I'm using standard visual effects now
2007-11-17T22:36:00.000Z	nickrud	talcite	install the compizconfig-settings-manager
2007-11-17T22:36:00.000Z	talcite	nickrud	thanks
2007-11-17T22:37:00.000Z	nickrud	talcite	it'll be under system->prefs->advanced desktop
2007-12-21T23:47:00.000Z	nickrud	talcite	edit your /etc/apt/sources.list , comment out the cdrom line near the top (you may need to uncomment [remove the # at the beginning of the line] for all lines starting with 'deb '])
2008-03-04T09:35:00.000Z	nickrud	talcite	one or the other is required for compiz ...
2008-03-04T09:36:00.000Z	talcite	nickrud	I have an nvidia card... am I using AIGLX?
2008-03-04T09:36:00.000Z	nickrud	talcite	yes
2008-03-04T09:36:00.000Z	nickrud	talcite	reduce FSAA . Otherwise, I know little to nothing about nvidia
2008-03-04T09:37:00.000Z	nickrud	talcite	or maybe 800x600 ;)
2008-04-25T10:15:00.000Z	nickrud	talcite	get rid of it, just keep your kernels in the /boot on the root partition ;)
2008-04-25T10:15:00.000Z	talcite	nickrud	oh =S. Err how should I do that?
2008-04-25T10:15:00.000Z	nickrud	talcite	but resizing issues? None that I can think of :)
2008-04-25T10:15:00.000Z	nickrud	talcite	you could unmount boot , then run sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-$(uname -r) grub
2008-04-25T10:15:00.000Z	talcite	nickrud	ahh ok good. would I need to reboot onto a liveCD? or is unmounting the partition good enough?
2008-04-25T10:16:00.000Z	talcite	nickrud	for resizing I mean. I think I'll move to /boot next clean install
2008-04-25T10:16:00.000Z	nickrud	talcite	no reason you couldn't resize it
2008-04-25T10:16:00.000Z	talcite	nickrud	great. Thanks
2008-05-29T09:56:00.000Z	talcite	nickrud	do you have any idea what happened to my system/what I can do to fix it?
2008-05-29T09:57:00.000Z	nickrud	talcite	I'd start with sudo apt-get remove --purge gdm , then sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop (since that package will be removed also)
2008-05-29T09:58:00.000Z	talcite	nickrud	ahh. Alright, I'll give it a shot. Thanks =D
