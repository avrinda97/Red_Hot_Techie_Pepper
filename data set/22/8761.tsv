2005-06-08T11:11:00.000Z	TheMuso		Hey all. I have set up Ubuntu Hoary on my system using Software RAID, using my motherboard's on-board Promise controller, one drive plugged into a SATA port, and the other into the PATA port for that controller. All is installed with no problems, however DMA doesn't seem to work for my CD-ROM drive, or another drive that I have plugged into the standard IDE ports on my motherboard. Windows and the BIOS reports that all drives are, and 
2005-06-08T11:13:00.000Z	katzor	TheMuso	try what 'hdparm /dev/device' says
2005-06-08T11:15:00.000Z	katzor		/etc/hdparm.conf
2005-06-08T11:16:00.000Z	TheMuso	katzor	What specifically am I looking for?
2005-06-08T11:16:00.000Z	katzor		a line that says sth with dma
2005-06-08T11:16:00.000Z	katzor		using_dma
2005-06-08T11:17:00.000Z	TheMuso	katzor	It says 0.
2005-06-08T11:17:00.000Z	katzor		allright
2005-06-08T11:17:00.000Z	TheMuso	katzor	I know this drive can do DMA, and when I run the LIVE CD, it does use DMA.
2005-06-08T11:17:00.000Z	katzor	TheMuso	do sudo gedit /etc/hdparm.conf
2005-06-08T11:17:00.000Z	katzor		and simply tell it to
2005-06-08T11:17:00.000Z	TheMuso	katzor	Already done that.
2005-06-08T11:18:00.000Z	TheMuso		The message I get when trying to activate DMA is HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted.
2005-06-08T11:18:00.000Z	katzor	TheMuso	 mine has sth like /dev/hdb { dma = on}
2005-06-08T11:20:00.000Z	katzor	TheMuso	do you run it as root?
2005-06-08T11:20:00.000Z	TheMuso	katzor	Yes.
2005-06-08T11:21:00.000Z	katzor	TheMuso	hmm...dunno what that is, the drive is IDE right?
2005-06-08T11:21:00.000Z	TheMuso	katzor	Yes. As I said earlier, it works with DMA when the LIVE CD is running.
2005-06-08T11:22:00.000Z	TheMuso	katzor	The same thing happens with my CD-ROM drive.
2005-06-08T11:22:00.000Z	katzor	TheMuso	hm, sorry , i cant help there
2005-06-08T11:23:00.000Z	katzor	TheMuso	file a bug if you want to
2005-06-08T11:23:00.000Z	TheMuso	katzor	Thanks anyway, will go to mailing list.
