2011-03-09T21:58:00.000Z	Guest15299		android trackpad. Do you know how can this be acheived?
2011-03-09T21:58:00.000Z	kpettit	Guest15299	there are a bunch of android apps in the appstore for that.
2011-03-09T21:58:00.000Z	Guest15299	kpettit	do you know one working? i can  t make them work in linux
2011-03-09T21:59:00.000Z	kpettit	Guest15299	I'm checking...
2011-03-09T21:59:00.000Z	Guest15299	kpettit	android trackpad looks GREAT
2011-03-09T21:59:00.000Z	Guest15299	kpettit	problem is that i don t understand the questions asked
2011-03-09T22:00:00.000Z	kpettit	Guest15299	I'm loading it.  One sec...
2011-03-09T22:02:00.000Z	kpettit	Guest15299	that one kind of sucks.  Requires you to install a client on the desktop
2011-03-09T22:02:00.000Z	Guest15299	kpettit	oh i see. a lot then suck
2011-03-09T22:04:00.000Z	Guest15299	kpettit	don t know it...
2011-03-09T22:05:00.000Z	kpettit	Guest15299	It allows you to use one keyboard/mouse on multiple computers.  So I have a Linux/mac and windows computers all right next to each other with 3 monitors.  WIth synergys I move my house to the edge of one screen and it starts controlling the next one.  So it's seemless
2011-03-09T22:05:00.000Z	Guest15299	kpettit	with bluettoth there is Telephone mouse
2011-03-09T22:05:00.000Z	Guest15299	kpettit	this is cool!!!!
2011-03-09T22:06:00.000Z	Guest15299	kpettit	nonetheless, i only have one old laptop, nothing else..
2011-03-09T22:12:00.000Z	kpettit	Guest15299	Are you going to be using your linux box for multimedia stuff?  If so Boxee is a good app and it has a good remote app on Android
2011-03-09T22:13:00.000Z	Guest15299	kpettit	basically, i d like to use the laptop. the screen is out. so i must go through VGA and TV, but it must go smooth
2011-03-09T22:16:00.000Z	kpettit	Guest15299	I'd install boxee instead of xbmc.  The packages are alot easier to install and there are addons like the remote for andoid/iphone and such
2011-03-09T22:16:00.000Z	kpettit	Guest15299	I think it depends on your video card.   Give it a try.  Doesn't hurt to check it out
2011-03-09T22:35:00.000Z	kpettit	Guest15299	there is "Boxee WiFi Remote" in android marketplace
