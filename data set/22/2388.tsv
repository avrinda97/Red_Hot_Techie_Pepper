2010-01-05T05:35:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	well I was booted into text mode and the result is till the same
2010-01-05T05:36:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	I've enter the correct command and the computer just rebooted
2010-01-05T05:37:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	then I was entered into text mode login form
2010-01-05T05:38:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	I then type usermod -l ubuntu ubuntu2009
2010-01-05T05:38:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	oh but it seemed that it did
2010-01-05T05:38:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	I can't seem to exit this phase
2010-01-05T05:38:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	so I directly rebooted my computer again
2010-01-05T05:40:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	Yes like you said it had switched run levels but I reboot the computer directly because I can't exit.
2010-01-05T05:41:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	recovery mode? But wouldn't it produce the same result
2010-01-05T05:42:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	okay, but it would ask you to login and you need to type the password. So it might not work.
2010-01-05T05:43:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	hm, what would be the basic requirements for an accepted username?
2010-01-05T05:43:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	password? Yes.
2010-01-05T05:45:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	wait so I'll use the command using root power; sudo usermod -l
2010-01-05T05:46:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	Then I'll login as root?
2010-01-05T05:47:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	well it might be dangerous if I access the root account but could I have create another user account
2010-01-05T05:47:00.000Z	mkanyicy	LinuX2half1	dangerous?
2010-01-05T05:48:00.000Z	mkanyicy	LinuX2half1	how dangerous?
2010-01-05T05:48:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	well not exactly but it isn't enabled by default
2010-01-05T05:48:00.000Z	mkanyicy	LinuX2half1	recovery mode is strictly for that
2010-01-05T05:48:00.000Z	mkanyicy	LinuX2half1	on recovery mode it is enabled!
2010-01-05T05:49:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	alright then, so I'll return to the text mode which is sudo init 1.
2010-01-05T05:49:00.000Z	LinuX2half1	mkanyicy	well then I'll be back.
