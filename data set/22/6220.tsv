2007-01-29T08:32:00.000Z	Luc1		Hi. How to install Ubuntu when my CD-ROM cannot boot from CD? I tryed sbootmgr, but in the menu isn't CDROM to select.
2007-01-29T08:32:00.000Z	Luc1		Is any boot disket?
2007-01-29T08:33:00.000Z	genii	Luc1	You can make a bootable floppy from one of the disk images on the cdrom which will boot to floppy then do the rest of the install from cd
2007-01-29T08:34:00.000Z	Luc1	genii	You think Smart boot manager?
2007-01-29T08:35:00.000Z	genii	Luc1	In your bios?
2007-01-29T08:36:00.000Z	Luc1	genii	In BIOS I of course do boot from floppy.
2007-01-29T08:36:00.000Z	genii	Luc1	and the computer has a cdrom but just cannot boot from cdrom?
2007-01-29T08:36:00.000Z	Luc1	genii	Yes. BIOS is very old.
2007-01-29T08:37:00.000Z	genii	Luc1	Yes, so there exists a floppy drive file which you create a boot floppy from. Then you boot to this floppy and continue from the cd after
2007-01-29T08:38:00.000Z	genii	Luc1	I will find a suitable link for you to use
2007-01-29T08:38:00.000Z	Luc1	genii	:-)
2007-01-29T08:55:00.000Z	genii	Luc1	What OS is on the laptop right now?
2007-01-29T08:56:00.000Z	Luc1	genii	Why? How to you know, then I have laptop? I have Ubuntu 6.06.
2007-01-29T08:57:00.000Z	genii	Luc1	If you already have an ubuntu distribution then more practical to do a dist-upgrade than the smart boot manager method.
2007-01-29T08:58:00.000Z	Luc1	genii	I want install ubuntu to other PC.
2007-01-29T09:07:00.000Z	genii	Luc1	I got ghosted but am returned
2007-01-29T09:08:00.000Z	genii	Luc1	to reiterate what may not have been sent:
2007-01-29T09:08:00.000Z	genii	Luc1	OK, then the method would be to make the Smart Boot Manager floppy from http://btmgr.sourceforge.net/download.html and then continue the install from the cdrom
2007-01-29T09:08:00.000Z	genii	Luc1	If you are interested in a netboot method and the box which you wish to install to has boot from network ability I can also help with that way
2007-01-29T09:10:00.000Z	Luc1	genii	Thanks for interest. I will study your links and I will answer you maybe tomorow.
2007-01-29T09:11:00.000Z	genii	Luc1	I shall be here at about the same hour as now
2007-01-29T09:11:00.000Z	Luc1	genii	ok
