2008-02-03T04:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	borncrazy	something ended up on your .bashrc or .profile conf files
2008-02-03T04:14:00.000Z	borncrazy	erUSUL	how do i reset it?
2008-02-03T04:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	borncrazy	first check them i may be wrong on my guess...
2008-02-03T04:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	borncrazy	with a text editor...
2008-02-03T04:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	borncrazy	if you want to reset them copy fresh copies from /etc/skel/
2008-02-03T04:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	borncrazy	cp -i /etc/skel/.bashrc ~
2008-02-03T04:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	borncrazy	cp -i /etc/skel/.profile ~
2008-02-03T04:19:00.000Z	borncrazy	erUSUL	"cp -i /etc/skel/.profile ~" did not work
2008-02-03T04:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	borncrazy	error msg?
2008-02-03T04:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	borncrazy	try with the other file
2008-02-03T04:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	borncrazy	cp -i /etc/skel/.bashrc ~
2008-02-03T04:21:00.000Z	borncrazy	erUSUL	still same problem
2008-02-03T04:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	borncrazy	then my guess was wrong...
2008-02-03T04:26:00.000Z	borncrazy	erUSUL	any ideas?
2008-02-03T04:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	borncrazy	no; sorry
