2010-01-03T01:49:00.000Z	guntbert	blakkheim	please don't mix up "not the latest" with "outdated"
2010-01-22T23:56:00.000Z	guntbert	blakkheim	be warned that sudo passwd user is the *one* method I know to bork an encrypted homedir
2010-01-22T23:57:00.000Z	blakkheim	guntbert	he didn't mention encryption
2010-01-22T23:57:00.000Z	guntbert	blakkheim	I didn't imply that :) - just a general warning from a support case last week
2010-01-22T23:57:00.000Z	blakkheim	guntbert	k
2010-01-22T23:58:00.000Z	guntbert	blakkheim	and people tend to forget about that encryption - I will ask actively in the future
2010-02-06T01:25:00.000Z	guntbert	blakkheim	don't recommend that please
2010-02-06T01:25:00.000Z	blakkheim	guntbert	this is changing his USER's password, tell me what is wrong with that please
2010-02-06T01:26:00.000Z	guntbert	blakkheim	that is the wrong way to do it - with an encrypted home you might loose access
2010-02-06T01:26:00.000Z	blakkheim	guntbert	this person didn't mention anything about encryption, and that's kind of an "opt-in" thing during the install, isn't it? also it's "lose" not "loose" :/
2010-02-06T01:27:00.000Z	guntbert	blakkheim	you english is better than mine but in support you should stay on the cautious side
2010-02-08T00:38:00.000Z	guntbert	blakkheim	reto`: please don't start such a discussion :)
2010-02-08T00:38:00.000Z	blakkheim	guntbert	ok sorry
2010-02-16T22:09:00.000Z	blakkheim	guntbert	"must" or "should" ?
2010-02-16T22:10:00.000Z	guntbert	blakkheim	if you want to keep your system intact: must - else "should" ?
2010-02-16T22:10:00.000Z	blakkheim	guntbert	ok. i use sudo and have no problems, so just wondered.
2010-02-16T22:11:00.000Z	guntbert	blakkheim	please read the gksudo factoid
2010-02-26T22:47:00.000Z	blakkheim	guntbert	aren't you an op?
2010-02-26T22:48:00.000Z	guntbert	blakkheim	fortunately not :-)
2010-04-02T02:00:00.000Z	guntbert	blakkheim	please recommend sudo -i instead of sudo su
