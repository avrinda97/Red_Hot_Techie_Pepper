2012-11-17T16:00:00.000Z	japro		argh, seriously so apparently X/fglrx wants stuff to be in usr/lib64 but everything is in usr/lib
2012-11-17T16:00:00.000Z	japro		symlinking doesn't fix it it seems
2012-11-17T16:02:00.000Z	japro		i tried reinstalling fglrx and xorg so far
2012-11-17T16:02:00.000Z	japro		aticonfig claims i don't have a compatible adapter
2012-11-17T16:03:00.000Z	japro		yesterday it worked fine and i can't figure out what has changed
2012-11-17T16:03:00.000Z	invariant	japro	on Ubuntu, you just need to install fglrx-updates and give up the possibility of installing a vanilla version.
2012-11-17T16:04:00.000Z	invariant	japro	if you don't want such dependence on Ubuntu packages and just run the latest, you should switch to a community distro, like Arch.
2012-11-17T16:05:00.000Z	invariant	japro	it is possible to get it to work, but Ubuntu switched to multi-arch which complicates things.
2012-11-17T16:05:00.000Z	invariant	japro	the fglrx distributions makes some assumptions which are not true in Ubuntu.
2012-11-17T16:05:00.000Z	invariant	japro	you can of course work around this by analyzing the package contents, but that requires some technical skill that you might not have or you might not care about.
2012-11-17T16:06:00.000Z	invariant	japro	does that help?
2012-11-17T16:06:00.000Z	invariant	japro	I could.
2012-11-17T16:06:00.000Z	invariant	japro	and what did you do then?
2012-11-17T16:06:00.000Z	invariant	japro	and what version of Ubuntu are your running?
2012-11-17T16:08:00.000Z	invariant	japro	if you read the documentation, you can see trouble shooting steps.
2012-11-17T16:08:00.000Z	japro	invariant	documentation found where?
2012-11-17T16:11:00.000Z	invariant	japro	in the documentation location.
2012-11-17T16:11:00.000Z	invariant	japro	which will lead you to /usr/share/doc/fglrx-updates/index.html
2012-11-17T16:11:00.000Z	invariant	japro	you should read the manual for the systems that you are using before asking a question.
2012-11-17T16:40:00.000Z	japro	invariant	well, it turns out installing glew actually was the culprit... to get fglrx to work i have to apparently use the (dirty) fix of symlinking lib64 to lib... but the install script of glew actually created a lib64 directory overwriting the symlink...
2012-11-17T16:41:00.000Z	invariant	japro	you didn't say anything about glew to me.
2012-11-17T16:41:00.000Z	invariant	japro	what is glew?
