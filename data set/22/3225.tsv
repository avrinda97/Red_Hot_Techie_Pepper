2008-11-06T05:44:00.000Z	karsten	ecclesiastes_	Reading.
2008-11-06T05:44:00.000Z	karsten	ecclesiastes_	What am I looking for?
2008-11-06T05:44:00.000Z	karsten	ecclesiastes_	... which module don't you want?
2008-11-06T05:45:00.000Z	ecclesiastes_	karsten	the correct driver is AEC62XX which is already loaded..  pata_artop is loaded despite the black list and screws up
2008-11-06T05:46:00.000Z	karsten	ecclesiastes_	Looks as if USB config might be inducing that.
2008-11-06T05:46:00.000Z	ecclesiastes_	karsten	pata_artop seems to be part of libata. Can I rm pata_artop ?
2008-11-06T05:47:00.000Z	karsten	ecclesiastes_	The file or rmmod the module?
2008-11-06T05:47:00.000Z	karsten	ecclesiastes_	Hold off on nuking the file.
2008-11-06T05:48:00.000Z	karsten	ecclesiastes_	I'm not super familiar with the blacklist sytax, but you have install pata_artop /bin/true
2008-11-06T05:48:00.000Z	karsten	ecclesiastes_	Is that what you want?
2008-11-06T05:50:00.000Z	ecclesiastes_	karsten	What I've read said blacklist would only delay the install, but that syntax would make sure..
2008-11-06T05:50:00.000Z	karsten	ecclesiastes_	OK
2008-11-06T05:50:00.000Z	ecclesiastes_	karsten	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modprobe
2008-11-06T06:09:00.000Z	ecclesiastes_	karsten	still there?
2008-11-06T06:09:00.000Z	karsten	ecclesiastes_	yeah.
2008-11-06T06:09:00.000Z	karsten	ecclesiastes_	Got me stumped.
2008-11-06T06:12:00.000Z	ecclesiastes_	karsten	I got stumped just a few minutes ago on a grub problem .. I appreciate your help. Could you let me me know if you need to drop the question?
2008-11-06T06:13:00.000Z	karsten	ecclesiastes_	What's the question?
2008-11-06T06:14:00.000Z	ecclesiastes_	karsten	can I rm the module? I can't see any other way to uninstall it.
2008-11-06T06:14:00.000Z	karsten	ecclesiastes_	Try a rename.  'mv <module-file> <module-file>.disabled'
2008-11-06T06:14:00.000Z	karsten	ecclesiastes_	... you can undo that trivially if needed.
