2006-10-28T15:37:00.000Z	IndyBC		Once, I installed GVim, but I have uninstalled it. However, each time I right click on a text file, it has the option "Open with GVim". How will I remove that?

2006-10-28T15:42:00.000Z	IndyBC		Dapper Drake used to recognise my USB mp3 player, but Edgy Eft does not. Can anybody help, please?
2006-10-28T15:43:00.000Z	macd	IndyBC	is it possible its treating it as a removable disk?
2006-10-28T15:45:00.000Z	IndyBC	macd	When I had Dapper Drake, I just put it in the USB port, and it made a window of the contents appear. But now nothing happens, i think not only it is not automounted, but it does not see it as well.
