2007-09-15T11:00:00.000Z	|brad|	fatcatmatt	and looking at the title bar it looks like you were on youtube, thus using flash. flash and linux get along like oil and water

2007-09-15T14:01:00.000Z	|brad|	fatcatmatt	did you have to reinstall?
2007-09-15T14:01:00.000Z	fatcatmatt	|brad|	yes, i installed, but check this out, during the live session, i installed flash on it and the youtube videos ran fine
