2007-09-28T14:10:00.000Z	jim		with the idea hopefully that I can use a lvm / (since that's the only space I have right now)
2007-09-28T14:10:00.000Z	jim		and /boot in the / partition
2007-09-28T14:10:00.000Z	jim		soo... is this possible?
2007-09-28T14:12:00.000Z	velko	jim	i don't understand what do you want to achieve
2007-09-28T14:13:00.000Z	velko	jim	hi. do you want to install ubuntu without a cd using debootstrap? ok...
2007-09-28T14:14:00.000Z	velko	jim	i don't think that you can debootstrap ubuntu from debian and vice versa...
2007-09-28T14:15:00.000Z	velko	jim	i can't really help you with this looping
2007-09-28T14:17:00.000Z	jim	velko	what I have is the etch debootstrap
2007-09-28T14:18:00.000Z	velko	jim	well you might try. i have never cross installed this way. i'm curious if it will work anyway :-)
2007-09-28T14:19:00.000Z	velko	jim	i guess you don't have to compile the ubuntu debootstrap. try first installing it from a binary deb
2007-09-28T14:21:00.000Z	jim	velko	ok,,, you available to help me try? I do have some experience but it's worth it to have someone hanging who understands the process and can lead me around dead ends
2007-09-28T14:21:00.000Z	velko	jim	i'm hanging around. but i have to package my luggage (today i'll fly home), so i wont be available all the time
2007-09-28T14:22:00.000Z	velko	jim	i'm in germany is home is bulgaria. but this is really off topic :-)
2007-09-28T14:45:00.000Z	velko	jim	feisty
2007-09-28T15:40:00.000Z	velko	jim	did the install worked?
2007-09-28T15:40:00.000Z	jim	velko	the build seemed to work
2007-09-28T15:40:00.000Z	velko	jim	cool. learned something new :-) thank you
2007-09-28T15:42:00.000Z	velko	jim	oh. i was left with the impression that the debootstrapping went well
2007-09-28T15:42:00.000Z	jim	velko	I have debootstrap... wut do I do now :)
2007-09-28T15:43:00.000Z	velko	jim	wait a second. i have a link for you
2007-09-28T15:43:00.000Z	velko	jim	 http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/426
