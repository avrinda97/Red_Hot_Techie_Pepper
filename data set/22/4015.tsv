2008-04-24T06:48:00.000Z	Orbixx		Anyone know why manual connection with WiFi needs to be reconfigured on every startup to work?
2008-04-24T06:48:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Orbixx	thats your resolv.conf
2008-04-24T06:48:00.000Z	Orbixx	arvind_khadri	Care to elaborate a little?
2008-04-24T06:49:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Orbixx	on every restart resolv.conf gets re setted to an older value
2008-04-24T06:49:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Orbixx	linkinxp /etc/resolv.conf
2008-04-24T06:49:00.000Z	Orbixx	arvind_khadri	There has only been one value in resolv.conf
2008-04-24T06:50:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Orbixx	linkinxp to make that file permanent you need to use resolvconf package
2008-04-24T06:51:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Orbixx	when you set dns values into the "netwrok-admin" the values will be entered in that file
2008-04-24T06:51:00.000Z	Orbixx	arvind_khadri	Yes, I know.
2008-04-24T06:52:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Orbixx	so for making the change permanent use the package...and then edit /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base
2008-04-24T06:52:00.000Z	Orbixx	arvind_khadri	Could I not just make it unwritable?
2008-04-24T06:53:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Orbixx	that wont be a good thing
2008-04-24T06:54:00.000Z	Orbixx	arvind_khadri	Can you give me an example command with resolvconf, please?
2008-04-24T06:54:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Orbixx	the way  i suggested is official ubuntu forums one
2008-04-24T06:54:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Orbixx	example as in what
2008-04-24T06:54:00.000Z	Orbixx	arvind_khadri	resolvconf --example
2008-04-24T06:56:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Orbixx	the package resolvconf sets the daemon onto itself...to edit it sudo vim /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base
2008-04-26T07:52:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Orbixx	hii
2008-04-26T07:53:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Orbixx	wassup
2008-04-26T07:55:00.000Z	Orbixx	arvind_khadri	Any ideas?
2008-04-26T07:55:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Orbixx	no ideas ... well one thing i can suggest is file a bug right now and google
2008-04-26T07:55:00.000Z	Orbixx	arvind_khadri	Where do I file a bug?
