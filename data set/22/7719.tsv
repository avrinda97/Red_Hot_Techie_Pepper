2011-03-14T07:24:00.000Z	en1gma		yea i know about wine and even cedega but i just want to know if halo can work and i got it from there
2011-03-14T07:26:00.000Z	en1gma		yea
2011-03-14T07:27:00.000Z	en1gma		im looking in winedb and it dont list it
2011-03-14T07:28:00.000Z	en1gma		i checking too
2011-03-14T07:29:00.000Z	josh_	en1gma	my opinion is why not try it? what's the worse to come of it, useless software? You can always remove it ;)
2011-03-14T07:24:00.000Z	josh_	en1gma	dr_Willis beat me to it; WINE is your weapon of choice there.
2011-03-14T07:25:00.000Z	josh_	en1gma	if its in winedb than sure. :|
2011-03-14T07:26:00.000Z	josh_	en1gma	halo CE right?
2011-03-14T07:26:00.000Z	josh_	en1gma	looks like a hell yes. Good thing too, I have that upstairs but I had no idea people still played it ;)
2011-03-14T07:27:00.000Z	en1gma	josh_	 how do you know it will work
2011-03-14T07:27:00.000Z	josh_	en1gma	the winedb lists it as platinum, wait for link
2011-03-14T07:28:00.000Z	en1gma	josh_	 thanks
2011-03-14T07:28:00.000Z	josh_	en1gma	whoap. hold that thought, maybe it's not so hot on current systems.
2011-03-14T07:33:00.000Z	en1gma	josh_	i looking for a good current install guide...do you know of one that will work with ubuntu 10.10 and an nvidia 9800gt
2011-03-14T07:34:00.000Z	josh_	en1gma	for halo?? Should be able to pop the cd in and open the installer
2011-03-14T07:34:00.000Z	josh_	en1gma	just right click and open with wine, not the cautious-handler or w/e it is
2011-03-14T07:36:00.000Z	josh_	en1gma	what was the err msg?
2011-03-14T07:37:00.000Z	josh_	en1gma	funny thing with cd's in the current iteration of ubuntu, they complain about executable bit (ask him if that's what it was)
2011-03-14T07:37:00.000Z	josh_	en1gma	make sure you use wine loader directly, and not with nautilus's default cautious-loader or w/e it is.
2011-03-14T07:38:00.000Z	josh_	en1gma	cautious-launcher is what it is, prolly.
2011-03-14T07:41:00.000Z	josh_	en1gma	well, if you have no space on windows (like right-click C [D?] and it says you have zilch space), a VM wouldn't help =s
