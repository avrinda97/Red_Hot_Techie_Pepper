2011-10-08T02:49:00.000Z	Chwoka		so is anybody else willing to take a crack at my bizarre wired networking problem?
2011-10-08T02:50:00.000Z	bazhang	Chwoka	ask the channel and see
2011-10-08T02:52:00.000Z	bazhang	Chwoka	whats the chipset
2011-10-08T02:53:00.000Z	bazhang	Chwoka	lspci output to paste.ubuntu.com
2011-10-08T02:55:00.000Z	bazhang	Chwoka	if you can spot the single line then just type it here
2011-10-08T02:56:00.000Z	bazhang	Chwoka	does ifconfig show eth0
2011-10-08T02:57:00.000Z	bazhang	Chwoka	and what is the output of sudo dhclient eth0  (just tell us if there is a lease granted or not)
2011-10-08T03:47:00.000Z	Chwoka	bazhang	is that aforementioned link where i can get ethtool from? don't leave me bazhanging!
2011-10-08T03:03:00.000Z	Chwoka	bazhang	uh, it asks for my password and then what i type is invisible (which might be for privacy) but enter just gives me line breaks and then, shortly afterwards, a new prompt where previously there was nothing but line breaks.
2011-10-08T03:04:00.000Z	bazhang	Chwoka	and what happens when you try to ping www.google.com
2011-10-08T03:07:00.000Z	Chwoka	bazhang	?
2011-10-08T03:11:00.000Z	bazhang	Chwoka	thats odd. try bringing the device down then up again. sudo ifdown eth0 then ifup
2011-10-08T03:12:00.000Z	bazhang	Chwoka	barring that, could be a dns issue
2011-10-08T03:15:00.000Z	Chwoka	bazhang	how would it be a dns problem? i'm connecting to the internet plenty fine with 2 other computers
2011-10-08T03:47:00.000Z	bazhang	Chwoka	packages.ubuntu.com ?
2011-10-08T03:19:00.000Z	bazhang	Chwoka	no cursing please
2011-10-08T03:30:00.000Z	Chwoka	bazhang	sorry for cursing. what do i do next?
2011-10-08T03:34:00.000Z	Chwoka	bazhang	should we try messing with the network configuraqtion boxes now?
2011-10-08T03:35:00.000Z	bazhang	Chwoka	that card should work out of the box. perhaps using ethtool to see what it supports
2011-10-08T03:40:00.000Z	Chwoka	bazhang	could i burn ethtool onto a cd and unstall it like that?
2011-10-08T03:42:00.000Z	bazhang	Chwoka	by usb stick even
2011-10-08T03:44:00.000Z	Chwoka	bazhang	get it here? https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/natty/+package/ethtool
