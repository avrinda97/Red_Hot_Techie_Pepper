2007-05-17T07:04:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		where / how would i go about checking if my cd roms are mounted / working and my hdds ?
2007-05-17T07:05:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		bernet, pepperbob ive typed mount but i'm not very good at reading this output I am new to using ubuntu/linux in general today is second day
2007-05-17T07:07:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		pepperbob ok i see my cd roms and such but i dont think my second harddrive is configured properly. Could you help me get that setup? I used the automatic use complete harddrive on the installation option so im guessing it ignored my slave drive.
2007-05-17T07:08:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		pepperbob post what?
2007-05-17T07:10:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		i want to mount my second harddrive
2007-05-17T07:10:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		I used automatic installation of ubuntu so i told it to just use all the freespace of the first harddrive.
2007-05-17T07:10:00.000Z	QuixoticJ		but i have a second harddrive in there that i can see with gparted which i got yesterday.
2007-05-17T07:11:00.000Z	KennyTheGeek	QuixoticJ	whats the problem with it?
2007-05-17T07:11:00.000Z	KennyTheGeek	QuixoticJ	what FS does it contain? or is it empty?
2007-05-17T07:12:00.000Z	KennyTheGeek	QuixoticJ	mount /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1 i think
2007-05-17T07:14:00.000Z	KennyTheGeek	QuixoticJ	what folder to you want to refer to the second harddrive?
2007-05-17T07:16:00.000Z	KennyTheGeek	QuixoticJ	The first harddrive is mounted at root, you can only have 1 partition mounted at root. so you can only make one giantific directory
2007-05-17T07:17:00.000Z	KennyTheGeek	QuixoticJ	but you can choose any directory to use, like Documents in your home folder or something like that
2007-05-17T07:18:00.000Z	KennyTheGeek	QuixoticJ	yup
2007-05-17T07:18:00.000Z	KennyTheGeek	QuixoticJ	yes... but you could put it in the rc script :)
2007-05-17T07:19:00.000Z	KennyTheGeek	QuixoticJ	add the mount line before exit 0 in /etc/rc.local
2007-05-17T07:21:00.000Z	KennyTheGeek	QuixoticJ	rc.local is a script executed upon boot. fstab is a file that handles permanent partitionmount
2007-05-17T07:23:00.000Z	KennyTheGeek	QuixoticJ	did you remember to make the directory before you mounted on it
2007-05-17T07:24:00.000Z	KennyTheGeek	QuixoticJ	mkdir directoryname
2007-05-17T07:25:00.000Z	KennyTheGeek	QuixoticJ	yes, but you mount the harddrive so it "links" to the partition. thats what mount does
2007-05-17T07:32:00.000Z	KennyTheGeek	QuixoticJ	yes, it will, but you can change that, but that requires edit of fstab
