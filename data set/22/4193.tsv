2008-10-05T10:12:00.000Z	wolfe		yikes, lots of people here
2008-10-05T10:12:00.000Z	wolfe		I asked this a lnog time ago and did get a commit submittsed in proposed and release
2008-10-05T10:12:00.000Z	wolfe		*released
2008-10-05T10:13:00.000Z	wolfe		how does one get a patch whichis released from proposed to a main branch?
2008-10-05T10:14:00.000Z	jim_p	wolfe	you dl the .patch file and patch the source code with it
2008-10-05T10:15:00.000Z	wolfe	jim_p	well, this has to do with the fucked up Xen package with Hardy
2008-10-05T10:15:00.000Z	wolfe		#218126
2008-10-05T10:15:00.000Z	wolfe		err... no url bot in here I guess
2008-10-05T10:15:00.000Z	wolfe		https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/218126
2008-10-05T10:16:00.000Z	wolfe		hiranotaka's packaged worked, ubuntu needs to release it mainstream, not just let it sit in -proposed
2008-10-05T10:16:00.000Z	wolfe		the default xen package does in fact cause the specific issue listed in the bug report, even when all pacakges are updated
2008-10-05T10:16:00.000Z	wolfe		it needs to be fixed
2008-10-05T10:16:00.000Z	jim_p	wolfe	cant you upgrade from proposed??
2008-10-05T10:16:00.000Z	wolfe		err, I mean released to main
2008-10-05T10:17:00.000Z	wolfe	jim_p	I don't like to use packages in proposed
2008-10-05T10:17:00.000Z	wolfe		I like to install stuff on a system and have it automatically work.
2008-10-05T10:17:00.000Z	wolfe		if the package works, then it needs to get pushed
2008-10-05T10:17:00.000Z	jim_p	wolfe	upgrade just that one and disable the repo after
2008-10-05T10:17:00.000Z	wolfe	jim_p	I downloaded it manually with wget ;)
2008-10-05T10:17:00.000Z	wolfe		though its kind of a burden, I thought I was causing xen to mess up
2008-10-05T10:19:00.000Z	jim_p	wolfe	doesnt it install with depk -i?
2008-10-05T10:19:00.000Z	jim_p	wolfe	*dpkg -i
