2006-01-21T16:24:00.000Z	TK4222		can anyone help me figure out why: when this command is run in a S55local file that i add via update-rc.d it doesnt add the drive? /bin/mount -t smbfs -o guest //192.168.0.100/downloads /mnt/wdownloads/
2006-01-21T16:24:00.000Z	dooglus	TK4222	does the command work if you run it from the command line using sudo?
2006-01-21T16:24:00.000Z	TK4222	dooglus	worksfine via sudo but trying to get it to run automatically on boot
2006-01-21T16:25:00.000Z	dooglus	TK4222	if you just want it to work, I suggest adding it to the end of /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh, since that already runs at boot time
2006-01-21T16:25:00.000Z	TK4222	dooglus	okay ill try thanks one sec
2006-01-21T16:28:00.000Z	TK4222	dooglus	trying its rebooting now
2006-01-21T16:29:00.000Z	TK4222	dooglus	nope adding it there didnt make it show up either
2006-01-21T16:29:00.000Z	dooglus	TK4222	odd
2006-01-21T16:30:00.000Z	TK4222	dooglus	yah running via script via commandline works perfectly
2006-01-21T16:30:00.000Z	dooglus	TK4222	when you run via the command line, does it prompt you for anything?
2006-01-21T16:31:00.000Z	TK4222	dooglus	only the password when i run sudo obviously.....but bootmisc is running as root so no need to run it with sudo right?
2006-01-21T16:33:00.000Z	TK4222	dooglus	hmmm not good if were both stumped :)
2006-01-21T16:34:00.000Z	dooglus	TK4222	I suggest putting some debugging in the bootmisc.sh file
2006-01-21T16:34:00.000Z	dooglus	TK4222	maybe a line "date > /tmp/bootmisc.txt" so you can be sure it ran
2006-01-21T16:35:00.000Z	TK4222	dooglus	cool i will try one second
2006-01-21T16:35:00.000Z	dooglus	TK4222	and maybe redirect output and error of the mount command too:   mount <blah> > /tmp/mount-out.txt 2> /tmp/mount-err.txt
2006-01-21T16:36:00.000Z	TK4222	dooglus	no problem :)
2006-01-21T16:38:00.000Z	TK4222	dooglus	rebooting
2006-01-21T16:41:00.000Z	TK4222	dooglus	oooh good idea: got this back "treeconnect failed: ERRDOS -ERRnoaccess (Access Denied.)
2006-01-21T16:41:00.000Z	TK4222	dooglus	makes no sense since it works fine when were booted properly
2006-01-21T16:42:00.000Z	dooglus	TK4222	bootmisc.sh runs pretty late in the boot sequence
2006-01-21T16:42:00.000Z	dooglus	TK4222	I don't know what that error message means
