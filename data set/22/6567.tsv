2006-10-04T08:23:00.000Z	adam		Help I can't install a package! log file details here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25624/
2006-10-04T08:24:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	why are you trying to install this package?
2006-10-04T08:25:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	does it provide a somehow better version of the libntp package you already have installed?
2006-10-04T08:29:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	Why are you checkinstalling? You already have a .deb backage.
2006-10-04T08:30:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	could you please paste the output of dpkg -l libnjb5 | grep ii
2006-10-04T08:31:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	you seem to be upgrading. If you're using checkinstall to build from source, specify the "name" to be libnjb5 to do it cleanly and avoid all these problems.
2006-10-04T08:32:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	and make sure you specify version to be 2.2.5
2006-10-04T08:36:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	no. Run the command "checkinstall". Then when it brings up that screen when it shows you the values, press 2 and enter. Type libnjb5. Press enter.
2006-10-04T08:38:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	yes, if "name" is libnjb5 and "version" is 2.2.5, press enter.
2006-10-04T08:39:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	view the log. Tell me what it says.
2006-10-04T08:40:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	I strongly suggest you run the command from scratch as "sudo checkinstall" rather than just installing the generated package with sudo.
2006-10-04T08:43:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	no problem. There is no issue. Just run "sudo checkinstall" right now.
2006-10-04T08:46:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	yes you are getting errors, because you're not changing the name to libnjb5 like I told you to.
2006-10-04T08:52:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	apt-cache search for those packages.
2006-10-04T09:00:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	"apt-cache search" just searches through the repositories for whatever string you specify.
2006-10-04T09:00:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	so if you want a package called bobfred, you would "apt-cache search bobfred" and it would list all the packages with bobfred in name or description.
2006-10-04T09:00:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	so when you find the package you want, you "apt-get install <package>" it.
2006-10-04T09:01:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	remind me why you're compiling a library you already have again?
2006-10-04T09:08:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	but you seem to already have that library installed.
2006-10-04T10:01:00.000Z	adam	ArrenLex	hey thanks for all the help. my mp3 player now says it's connected to the comp, but none of the linux music players realize it's there
2006-10-04T10:06:00.000Z	adam	ArrenLex	yo thanks for the help. we made progress. my mp3 player now says it's connected to something intead of just charging like it's on AC power
2006-10-04T10:06:00.000Z	ArrenLex	adam	I didn't really help much xD
