2008-04-06T14:28:00.000Z	Carroarmato0		Has anyone got experience with switching a Desktop Ubuntu to the Sever edition?
2008-04-06T14:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Carroarmato0	just switch kernels and don't start GDM in your default runlevel, and you're done.
2008-04-06T14:30:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	tonyyarusso	I have all my files on my account on the system, will they get affected?
2008-04-06T14:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Carroarmato0	You're not changing the system at all.
2008-04-06T14:31:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	tonyyarusso	So when I've installed the server, is there any fancy webcontrole interface which I can manage the system by default?
2008-04-06T14:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Carroarmato0	no.  Servers doing have a GUI - that's kinda the point.
2008-04-06T14:32:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	tonyyarusso	or do I have to install like webmin?
2008-04-06T14:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Carroarmato0	webmin is not supported nor recommended.
2008-04-06T14:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Carroarmato0	"strict"?  It serves...what more do you want?
2008-04-06T14:35:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	tonyyarusso	although I don't have a problem working with ssh and such.... I was kinda expecting a webinterface to connect to it and manage it from there in all comodity. :)
2008-04-06T14:35:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Carroarmato0	The reason such a thing is not included is because those types of control interfaces have serious security issues, and the technical board prefers to ship a secure product than a "convenient" one.
2008-04-06T14:36:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	tonyyarusso	ok I get it. But the sever is like, pure server, and not a Home Server?
2008-04-06T14:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Carroarmato0	define "home server"?  You can set up whatever programs you need.
2008-04-06T14:37:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	tonyyarusso	Well by "strict server" I mean the "hardcore" stuff like you mean, and by "Home server" I am picturing the comodity stuff
2008-04-06T14:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Carroarmato0	I don't understand.  I run the exact same things on my "home server" as my "corporate servers".
2008-04-06T14:39:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	tonyyarusso	so it's just the same thing, different name depending on the location of the server :D
2008-04-06T14:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Carroarmato0	sure
2008-04-06T14:40:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	tonyyarusso	gonna make myself a toaster server in that case :D
2008-04-06T14:40:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Carroarmato0	to match your dead badger server?
2008-04-06T14:41:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	tonyyarusso	yeah, he was starting to get smelly and scare the kids....
2008-04-06T14:42:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	tonyyarusso	... and get everyone sick when making toast :D
2008-04-06T14:43:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	tonyyarusso	thx for the help, guess there's no real need for me to run my system with another kernel since I use the server-side apps already on the desktop
