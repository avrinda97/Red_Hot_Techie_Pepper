2006-11-13T11:40:00.000Z	Doow		what's the preferred IDE in Ubuntu/Gnome? Is it anjuta? (I'm used to emacs/make, but I want to move on =)
2006-11-13T11:40:00.000Z	LjL	Doow	"preferred" by whom? ;)=
2006-11-13T11:44:00.000Z	LjL	Doow	i don't know really, but i think it was just left out from the bot's list by mistake, unintentionally
2006-11-15T15:28:00.000Z	LjL	Doow	source repositories are generally enabled by default (at least, the ones corresponding to binary repositories you have enabled)
2006-11-15T15:55:00.000Z	Doow	LjL	damn, you're fast =)
2006-11-15T15:55:00.000Z	LjL	Doow	when i know the answer ;)
2006-11-15T15:55:00.000Z	Doow	LjL	sofar you've answered almost everything I've asked
2006-11-15T16:01:00.000Z	LjL	Doow	i use apt-get. but then i also use kubuntu so no synaptic here. and yes, all in all it *is* easier to give commands that explain where to click (also considered that my short-term memory is sorely lacking)
2006-11-17T15:27:00.000Z	Doow	LjL	I only find dapper or cvs stuff there =(
2006-11-17T15:28:00.000Z	LjL	Doow	read the #ubuntu-xgl channel topic.
2006-11-17T15:28:00.000Z	Doow	LjL	ok
2006-11-17T15:29:00.000Z	Doow	LjL	as usual you're my hero =)
2006-11-29T15:12:00.000Z	LjL	Doow	it's long gone
2006-11-29T15:12:00.000Z	Doow	LjL	=)
2006-11-29T16:22:00.000Z	Doow	LjL	wow, that list was short compared to Feisty
2006-11-29T16:23:00.000Z	LjL	Doow	hmm? i see 79 vs 80, actually
2006-11-29T16:23:00.000Z	Doow	LjL	hm.. the link you gave in #ubuntu+1 had 900+ titles
2006-11-29T16:23:00.000Z	Doow	LjL	maybe it wasnt' the same thing
2006-11-29T16:24:00.000Z	LjL	Doow	that's the generic specification listing. note that link doesn't contain the word "feisty"
2006-11-29T16:24:00.000Z	LjL	Doow	there's two different links that i gave on there
2006-11-29T16:24:00.000Z	Doow	LjL	ah
2006-11-29T16:24:00.000Z	Doow	LjL	that explains it
