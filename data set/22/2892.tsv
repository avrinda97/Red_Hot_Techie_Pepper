2009-02-03T20:14:00.000Z	gafir777		Hi, does anybody know how to set up ubuntu and make the /var/www/ accessible to public internet, like a website?
2009-02-03T20:14:00.000Z	gafir777		if you know a good tutorial for this, it would be very helpful
2009-02-03T20:14:00.000Z	JackWinter	gafir777	google apache
2009-02-03T20:15:00.000Z	gafir777	JackWinter	i get on the apache page, but how can it set it up though? My server is working properly, local, but i'd like to open my router somehow
2009-02-03T20:16:00.000Z	JackWinter	gafir777	you proably have to open some ports up in your router to allow incoming connections to your server...
2009-02-03T20:16:00.000Z	gafir777		DragonLord: that's it? then it directly goes to the /var/www?
2009-02-03T20:18:00.000Z	gafir777		DragonLord:I'm in my router interface, it's a linksys cable modem, I'm trying to find the tab where I can set up the port 80
2009-02-03T20:19:00.000Z	JackWinter	gafir777	it might be called NAT, or firewall
2009-02-03T20:20:00.000Z	gafir777	JackWinter	Can't seem to find it, I have tabs: setup | wireless | Access Restrictions | Applications and Gaming | Administration | Status
2009-02-03T20:20:00.000Z	gafir777	JackWinter	APplications and Gaming seems like it, there is an "Application" field, and port rage, protocol Ip address and enable
2009-02-03T20:20:00.000Z	JackWinter	gafir777	can you browse your pages with 127.0.0.1.  if so probably the remaining hurdle is the blocking of ports in your router.
2009-02-03T20:21:00.000Z	gafir777	JackWinter	I can browse with 127.0.01
2009-02-03T20:21:00.000Z	JackWinter	gafir777	try access restrictions
2009-02-03T20:21:00.000Z	gafir777		yes
2009-02-03T20:21:00.000Z	JackWinter	gafir777	or possibly administration
2009-02-03T20:21:00.000Z	gafir777		jackwinter: What I see is this: http://www.no-ip.com/routers/linksys4.jpg
2009-02-03T20:21:00.000Z	gafir777		for application and gaming
2009-02-03T20:21:00.000Z	gafir777		I think this is what it is, no?
2009-02-03T20:22:00.000Z	JackWinter	gafir777	that's it..!
2009-02-03T20:22:00.000Z	gafir777	JackWinter	Cool, that was the "Gaming" tab, not very helpful title :)
2009-02-03T20:23:00.000Z	gafir777		so I set port range from 80 to 80, right?
2009-02-03T20:23:00.000Z	JackWinter	gafir777	gaming, hehe
