2007-12-09T22:06:00.000Z	ikonia	oreth|	it's probably running an fsck on your box if you've powered it off
2007-12-09T22:07:00.000Z	ikonia	oreth|	depends on corruption and the file system file
2007-12-09T22:13:00.000Z	oreth|	ikonia	is there a way to check to see if it's doing an FSCK on boot?
2007-12-09T22:13:00.000Z	ikonia	oreth|	it should say
2007-12-09T22:14:00.000Z	oreth|	ikonia	all i see is *Starting Anachronistic cron ana cron*  down to *Running local boot scripots (/etc/rc.local)
2007-12-09T22:14:00.000Z	ikonia	oreth|	boot off the livecd and see what you have put in /etc/rc.lcal
2007-12-09T22:14:00.000Z	oreth|	ikonia	i'm not understanindg your question
2007-12-09T22:15:00.000Z	ikonia	oreth|	put in a livecd, boot from it, mount your file system and look what scripts are in /etc/rc.local
2007-12-09T22:16:00.000Z	oreth|	ikonia	i'm on it
2007-12-09T22:30:00.000Z	oreth|	ikonia	my rc.local just says "exit 0"
2007-12-09T22:32:00.000Z	oreth|	ikonia	quite a few
