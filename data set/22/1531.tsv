2010-04-22T02:30:00.000Z	Gnea	dm1612	not if we don't know what your problem is
2010-04-22T02:31:00.000Z	dm1612	Gnea	the problem is that there is non-functional "add" button in network manager...(PPTP is for crating VPN connections)
2010-04-22T02:31:00.000Z	dm1612		(creating*)
2010-04-22T02:32:00.000Z	Gnea	dm1612	I see. perhaps there are requirements that need to be fullfilled in order for that button to become functional.
2010-04-22T02:32:00.000Z	dm1612	Gnea	yes, correct...I installled pptp-linux, and pptpd, but
2010-04-22T02:32:00.000Z	Gnea	dm1612	but for NM itself...
2010-04-22T02:32:00.000Z	dm1612		..on original website there is no .deb packages for pptp-config
2010-04-22T02:34:00.000Z	Gnea	dm1612	is network-manager-pptp installed?
2010-04-22T02:34:00.000Z	dm1612	Gnea	plugin is installable but non-functional for creating VPN connection...when you install plugin, "add" button appears functional, but no window for editing/creating the very VPN connection follows afterwards...
2010-04-22T02:34:00.000Z	dm1612		YES
2010-04-22T02:37:00.000Z	Gnea	dm1612	not sure if this works for karmic or not: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-configure-pptp-vpn-in-ubuntu-intrepid-and-jaunty.html
2010-04-22T02:39:00.000Z	Gnea	dm1612	and you're not the only one to have issues: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1357445
2010-04-22T02:40:00.000Z	dm1612		Gena, ok i see...
2010-04-22T02:40:00.000Z	dm1612		Gnea*, sorry, but it is manual...is there a simple way...to have it configured via nm?
2010-04-22T02:40:00.000Z	Gnea	dm1612	I'm not sure what else to suggest, I haven't had to use it yet so I'm a bit in the dark
2010-04-22T02:41:00.000Z	Gnea	dm1612	that's what I was trying to find, and like I said, you're not the only one to have problems configuring it via NM
2010-04-22T02:41:00.000Z	dm1612	Gnea	thanx a lot anyway...both 9.10 and 10.4 are great still...=)
2010-04-22T02:41:00.000Z	Gnea		odd_?
2010-04-22T02:41:00.000Z	Gnea	dm1612	good luck
