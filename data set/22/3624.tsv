2008-07-18T03:19:00.000Z	Reaby		we got major problem in loco channel, one person has updated his computer and now everythign else in usb is lost than hid devices- also he got apic error on cpu0 - any ideas to fix, since we got none.
2008-07-18T03:19:00.000Z	Reaby		modprobing other modules causes error
2008-07-18T03:21:00.000Z	superfirelord42	Reaby	wait, he is missing his usb drivers?
2008-07-18T03:21:00.000Z	Reaby	superfirelord42	also that.
2008-07-18T03:21:00.000Z	superfirelord42	Reaby	or his usb devices on the /dev tree?
2008-07-18T03:22:00.000Z	Reaby	superfirelord42	hid devices works, others don't modprobing causes error in .ko files as they are missing
2008-07-18T03:22:00.000Z	superfirelord42	Reaby	he probably needs to apt-get his kernel modules, they sound missing... i dont remember the package though...
2008-07-18T03:23:00.000Z	Reaby	superfirelord42	ok, i locate those and say to install them also.
2008-07-18T03:24:00.000Z	superfirelord42	Reaby	so he is missing his modules for usb, what else was happening?
2008-07-18T03:24:00.000Z	Reaby	superfirelord42	well he just installed kernel-image again, and is now rebooting computer
2008-07-18T03:25:00.000Z	superfirelord42	Reaby	what channel is he in?
2008-07-18T03:25:00.000Z	Reaby	superfirelord42	#ubuntu-fi
2008-07-18T03:25:00.000Z	superfirelord42	Reaby	ah, didnt catch it was a language channel earlier..
2008-07-18T03:26:00.000Z	Reaby	superfirelord42	yep, we runned out of ideas, that's why i came here
2008-07-18T03:26:00.000Z	superfirelord42	Reaby	he may be expiancing this... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=292273
2008-07-18T03:27:00.000Z	superfirelord42	Reaby	tell him to try sudo apt-get install linux-ubuntu-modules-$(uname -r)
2008-07-18T03:27:00.000Z	superfirelord42	Reaby	if the reinstall of the image does not work, that will install his modules... hopefully
2008-07-18T03:28:00.000Z	Reaby	superfirelord42	thanks. let's see as (if) he comes back online
2008-07-18T03:28:00.000Z	superfirelord42	Reaby	he is modifing his host computer? ouch...
