2010-04-17T20:33:00.000Z	chisel		so do i just creat an empty partition then stick the XP disc in and install to there?
2010-04-17T20:34:00.000Z	delac	chisel	that will propably render your ubuntu installation unbootable
2010-04-17T20:35:00.000Z	delac	chisel	installing XP after ubuntu will rewrite the bootloader and you wont be able to boot into ubuntu anymore
2010-04-17T20:35:00.000Z	chisel	delac	how does one work around this?
2010-04-17T20:35:00.000Z	delac	chisel	it is possible to make it work, but it's not a job for newbies
2010-04-17T20:38:00.000Z	delac	chisel	depends what you want to do with the xp installation
2010-04-17T20:39:00.000Z	delac	chisel	for example 3D gaming is not going to work
2010-04-17T20:39:00.000Z	chisel	delac	i just want to install and run WoW. i know i know, use wine......i call BS on that
2010-04-17T20:40:00.000Z	delac	chisel	i'm not quite sure, but i think its propably not going to work
2010-04-17T21:13:00.000Z	delac	chisel	and remember to BACK UP YOUR DATA!
2010-04-17T21:14:00.000Z	delac	chisel	well that's easy. just run the xp installation cd
2010-04-17T21:14:00.000Z	delac	chisel	it will overwrite ubuntu
2010-04-17T21:15:00.000Z	delac	chisel	allthough, you might want to partition your hard drive to two partitions before that
2010-04-17T21:15:00.000Z	delac	chisel	one for xp and one for ubuntu
2010-04-17T21:15:00.000Z	chisel	delac	the problem is setup.EXE
2010-04-17T21:15:00.000Z	delac	chisel	just use your ubuntu live-cd to do that
2010-04-17T21:16:00.000Z	delac	chisel	what about setup.exe?
2010-04-17T21:16:00.000Z	chisel	delac	ubuntu doesn't run .exe files
2010-04-17T21:17:00.000Z	delac	chisel	you have to boot your machine with the xp cd in th drive
2010-04-17T21:17:00.000Z	chisel	delac	i tried that, but it went straight to ubuntu again. what should i be doing?
2010-04-17T21:17:00.000Z	delac	chisel	and remember to set the machine to boot from cd
2010-04-17T21:17:00.000Z	delac	chisel	from bios
