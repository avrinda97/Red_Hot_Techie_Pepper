2009-01-22T08:02:00.000Z	dayo	bookmark	check what?
2009-01-22T08:02:00.000Z	bookmark		try sudo passwd as a normal user
2009-01-22T08:03:00.000Z	dayo	bookmark	when u install ubuntu on your box, u create a user. THAT user can do sudo passwd.
2009-01-22T08:03:00.000Z	bookmark	dayo	but not all users?
2009-01-22T08:04:00.000Z	dayo	bookmark	if u install ubuntu and during the install u create the user bookmark, THAT user bookmark can sudo passwd. now, after installation is complete, let's say to type 'adduser dayo'. User dayo will NOT be able to sudo passwd. u would have to sudo passwd FOR user dayo
2009-01-22T08:05:00.000Z	dayo	bookmark	BUT, if u now add dayo to sudo group, then dayo will *now* be able to sudo passwd *too*
2009-01-22T08:05:00.000Z	bookmark	dayo	thank you
