2010-05-01T15:21:00.000Z	nazgul_	zetheroo	Check your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2010-05-01T15:23:00.000Z	nazgul_	zetheroo	the driver name. paste it to pastebin

2010-05-01T15:25:00.000Z	nazgul_	zetheroo	that is a log file of a failing x server start. you have GM965/GL960 (line 49) but it tries to load some nvidia driver (line 103). are there any other x org log files?
2010-05-01T15:26:00.000Z	zetheroo	nazgul_	in var?
2010-05-01T15:27:00.000Z	nazgul_	zetheroo	in /var/log/
2010-05-01T15:27:00.000Z	zetheroo	nazgul_	yes there are quite a few ..
2010-05-01T15:28:00.000Z	nazgul_	zetheroo	pick the file with the newest time stamp. usually that it Xorg.0.log
2010-05-01T15:29:00.000Z	zetheroo	nazgul_	that is the one i sent you
2010-05-01T15:30:00.000Z	nazgul_	zetheroo	an nvidia card seems to be configured on your system. it fails loading it and then probably falls back to a generic driver. have you ever had nvidia in your system and removed it?
2010-05-01T15:30:00.000Z	zetheroo	nazgul_	no, that is the odd thing ... this is a laptop ... Intel graphics card
2010-05-01T15:31:00.000Z	nazgul_	zetheroo	please paste your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2010-05-01T15:32:00.000Z	zetheroo	nazgul_	does not exist
2010-05-01T15:34:00.000Z	zetheroo	nazgul_	what do you rekon?
2010-05-01T15:34:00.000Z	zetheroo	nazgul_	I removed a bunch of nvidia packages earlier ... and rebooted as well
2010-05-01T15:35:00.000Z	nazgul_	zetheroo	hmm odd . I would say this could be an X server bug. what ubuntu are yo running?
2010-05-01T15:35:00.000Z	zetheroo	nazgul_	Lucid ... upgraded yesterday
