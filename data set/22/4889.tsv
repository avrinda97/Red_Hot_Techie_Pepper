2007-10-29T20:05:00.000Z	vegananarchist		i did *sudo mount -o /dev/hdc /media/cdrom0* and i got *Mount: block device /dev/hdc is write protected, mounting read only. Mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdc, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.*
2007-10-29T20:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	vegananarchist	-o requires an argument
2007-10-29T20:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	vegananarchist	are you actually mounting a CDROM?
2007-10-29T20:11:00.000Z	vegananarchist	gordonjcp	i'm trying to mount the disk so i can write to it.
2007-10-29T20:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	vegananarchist	what actually is it though?
2007-10-29T20:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	vegananarchist	if it's an NTFS disk, you can't really write to it
2007-10-29T20:14:00.000Z	gordonjcp	vegananarchist	ok, what *exactly* are you trying to do?
2007-10-29T20:15:00.000Z	gordonjcp	vegananarchist	why are you trying to mount the CD if you want to burn stuff to it?
2007-10-29T20:16:00.000Z	vegananarchist	gordonjcp	becasue the cd rom drive is not showing up when i try to burn to disk
2007-10-29T20:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	vegananarchist	then you have some other problem
2007-10-29T20:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	vegananarchist	you can't mount a blank cd
2007-10-29T20:16:00.000Z	vegananarchist	gordonjcp	ok, how should i go about getting stuff off this computer
2007-10-29T20:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	vegananarchist	have you got a USB drive?
2007-10-29T20:17:00.000Z	vegananarchist	gordonjcp	yes

2007-10-29T20:17:00.000Z	vegananarchist	gordonjcp	but the usb drives are not mounting either when i put in the pen drive
2007-10-29T20:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	vegananarchist	hmm
2007-10-29T20:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	vegananarchist	stick the USB drive in and at a terminal type "dmesg"
2007-10-29T20:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	vegananarchist	see if it mentions anything about SCSI disks, or "/dev/sd<something>"
2007-10-29T20:20:00.000Z	vegananarchist	gordonjcp	i don't see anything for scsi disks, but i got errors for hdc
2007-10-29T20:21:00.000Z	vegananarchist	gordonjcp	i have a copy of DSL laying around, should i go through dsl and grab the files i need>
