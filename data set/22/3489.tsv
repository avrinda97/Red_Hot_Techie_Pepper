2008-09-02T13:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illixil	in linux youll do a LOT of websearching to get where you want
2008-09-02T13:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illixil	do that in terminal
2008-09-02T13:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illixil	dont paste swathes of text in here, use pastein
2008-09-02T13:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illixil	thats a REALLY good way to get banned
2008-09-02T13:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illixil	you dont have 3d support on your graphics card
2008-09-02T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illixil	you havent installed it. What graphics card do you have?
2008-09-02T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illixil	you need to install 3d drivers or you wont get squat
2008-09-02T14:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illixil	im sure you cant play games too great in windows withhout going to nvidia.com and getting the latest drivers can you? same deal
2008-09-02T14:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illixil	its not complicated, there are masses of docs around the place
2008-09-02T14:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illixil	t wont run as well as with the nvidia drivers
2008-09-02T14:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illixil	its all "plug and play" because the suppport in microsoft is much larger as companies have seen they will make more money from microsoft based ustomer
2008-09-02T14:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illixil	so they plough more money there
