2006-12-18T06:40:00.000Z	m0		hi, I still have firefox 1.5, synaptics didn't update it to 2.0 how do I update it to 2.0?
2006-12-18T06:41:00.000Z	m0		shouldn't it update automatically?
2006-12-18T06:41:00.000Z	ctkroeke1	m0	then you'll probably have to enable another repo
2006-12-18T06:42:00.000Z	ctkroeke1	m0	enable the backport repositories
2006-12-18T06:42:00.000Z	ctkroeke1	m0	you don't have to upgrade to edgy
