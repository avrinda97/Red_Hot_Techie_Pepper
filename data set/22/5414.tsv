2007-05-05T11:19:00.000Z	Micieri		Plus if it was a CD issue.. why does Knoppix work after I burned it?
2007-05-05T11:19:00.000Z	Micieri		Yes, it auto marks it
2007-05-05T11:20:00.000Z	Micieri		Well I tried it 4 times.. and I'm doing what Ubuntu told me to

2007-05-05T11:21:00.000Z	Micieri		Yes it boots, then when I get to the option screen, and go to any of the options, it just says crc error
2007-05-05T11:22:00.000Z	Micieri		Ok then, if it was the hard disk, why doesn't it boot?
2007-05-05T11:22:00.000Z	Micieri		Yeah it's hella weird :/
2007-05-05T11:22:00.000Z	Micieri		So said the HD
2007-05-05T11:23:00.000Z	Micieri		But that HD is formatted now.. so the problem lies with getting it installed

2007-05-05T11:19:00.000Z	rukuartic	Micieri	Are you marking the CD's as bootable when you burn them?
2007-05-05T11:20:00.000Z	rukuartic	Micieri	You don't want that option marked, I think
2007-05-05T11:20:00.000Z	rukuartic	Micieri	Does ubuntu boot when you put the CD in?
2007-05-05T11:21:00.000Z	rukuartic	Micieri	Sounds like you have a bad CD on your hands...
2007-05-05T11:21:00.000Z	rukuartic	Micieri	Or downloaded the file wrong.
2007-05-05T11:22:00.000Z	Micieri	rukuartic	- I tried 4 brands, I am downloading the right file, tried from 2 mirrors
2007-05-05T11:22:00.000Z	rukuartic	Micieri	Geez O_o thats weird...
2007-05-05T11:22:00.000Z	rukuartic	Micieri	You said your inittab wasn't working?
2007-05-05T11:23:00.000Z	rukuartic	Micieri	Try googling around for "missing inittab"
2007-05-05T11:23:00.000Z	rukuartic	Micieri	If you can get booted into the LiveCD some how or another you might be able to fix it.
2007-05-05T11:23:00.000Z	rukuartic	Micieri	I know :(
