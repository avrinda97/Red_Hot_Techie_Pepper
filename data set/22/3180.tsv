2008-11-18T03:23:00.000Z	robacarp1		is there a way to do a non-destructive re-installation of ubuntu?
2008-11-18T03:24:00.000Z	aLeSD	robacarp1	define non-destructive
2008-11-18T03:25:00.000Z	robacarp1	aLeSD	I'd like my system to be working again, but I don't want to reconfigure samba et al
2008-11-18T03:25:00.000Z	robacarp1	aLeSD	I'd like to not have to re-add all the users to the machine, too
2008-11-18T03:26:00.000Z	aLeSD	robacarp1	it's a good choise to understand what you need in /etc folder
2008-11-18T03:31:00.000Z	aLeSD	robacarp1	if u just restore that files ...
2008-11-18T03:26:00.000Z	aLeSD	robacarp1	and I imaine that you have a partition for the /home folder ....
2008-11-18T03:27:00.000Z	robacarp1	aLeSD	sorry, "its a good choice to understand what you need in /etc folder" I dont understand.  /home is not in a separate partition
2008-11-18T03:28:00.000Z	aLeSD	robacarp1	imagine how wonderfull it will be if it was on a different partition ...
2008-11-18T03:29:00.000Z	robacarp1	aLeSD	I am now seeing this.  but that wouldn't backup my users/passwords
2008-11-18T03:30:00.000Z	aLeSD	robacarp1	it's a bit complicated ... I mean easy to backup ... but maybe hard to restore lol
2008-11-18T03:30:00.000Z	robacarp1	aLeSD	right...do I need to restore them in single user mode or something?
2008-11-18T03:30:00.000Z	aLeSD	robacarp1	but you have to understand more of unix-like system if you want to proceed in that way
2008-11-18T03:31:00.000Z	robacarp1	aLeSD	well, I'll need to make sure that the user ids are all the same, right
2008-11-18T03:33:00.000Z	aLeSD	robacarp1	and think on a partition for your /home ... it's very usefull
2008-11-18T03:34:00.000Z	robacarp1	aLeSD	well, I am set on having /home on its own partition for sure now, but I still have a limping system with 15 users files on it....and they'd probably not like their passwords reset....its borked
2008-11-18T03:35:00.000Z	aLeSD	robacarp1	if you 're not going to delete your /home
2008-11-18T03:36:00.000Z	robacarp1	aLeSD	will reinstalling without reformatting (leave the partitions, fs intact) pick up my current /home?
2008-11-18T03:37:00.000Z	aLeSD	robacarp1	dunno I'm nooby in ubuntu ...I don't know how their scripts work
2008-11-18T03:38:00.000Z	robacarp1	aLeSD	yea....I think I am going to pull the hd and swap it out for the same and install fresh there....then copy files over.  I'll manually set the user and group ids if I have to
2008-11-18T03:39:00.000Z	robacarp1	aLeSD	this whole nonsense started when I nuked /usr/lib .... a big accident .... :-(
2008-11-18T03:40:00.000Z	aLeSD	robacarp1	evolution is an accident ... so ... be happy
