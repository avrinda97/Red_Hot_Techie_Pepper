2010-06-10T14:00:00.000Z	Sandking		does anyone know a free service for tomboy notes sync?
2010-06-10T14:02:00.000Z	popey	Sandking	uhm, Ubuntu one?
2010-06-10T14:02:00.000Z	popey	Sandking	I sync my tomboy notes on Windows, OSX and Ubuntu to Ubuntu One.
2010-06-10T14:03:00.000Z	Sandking	popey	i saw that i can do that with dropbox, but i'll check ubuntu one
2010-06-10T14:03:00.000Z	popey	Sandking	you can't sync notes in the same way with dropbox
2010-06-10T14:03:00.000Z	popey	Sandking	tomboy uses the snowy server protocol developed by the tomboy people, dropbox does not

2010-06-10T14:04:00.000Z	Sandking		it seems like it works
2010-06-10T14:04:00.000Z	popey	Sandking	yup, that's just file syncing, not recommended by the tomboy developers
2010-06-10T14:04:00.000Z	popey	Sandking	it does, I have used it, but it goes horribly wrong in some situations
2010-06-10T14:05:00.000Z	popey	Sandking	especially when a note is edited in two places
2010-06-10T14:05:00.000Z	Sandking	popey	thanks for pointing that out
2010-06-10T14:05:00.000Z	popey	Sandking	np
2010-06-10T14:06:00.000Z	Sandking	popey	can i use ubuntu one on windows machine?
2010-06-10T14:06:00.000Z	popey	Sandking	for syncing tomboy notes, yes
2010-06-10T14:06:00.000Z	popey	Sandking	i sync my tomboy notes on windows, osx and ubuntu
2010-06-10T14:07:00.000Z	Sandking	popey	i'm looking at this ubuntu one and to be honest aside 2 gb of sync memory and tomboy notes - is there anything worth looking at?
2010-06-10T14:07:00.000Z	popey	Sandking	it's music store
2010-06-10T14:07:00.000Z	popey	Sandking	they're adding features with each release of Ubuntu.
2010-06-10T14:08:00.000Z	Sandking	popey	it looks like it has a lot of potential when in sync with os
2010-06-10T14:09:00.000Z	Sandking	popey	is there some address book / web pages marking there by any chance? :]
