2010-12-30T22:00:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	and which other one s do you want to install?
2010-12-30T22:04:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	sorry i missed part of your question now.. what do you want to install?
2010-12-30T22:06:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	which others do you want to install?
2010-12-30T22:07:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	yes,
2010-12-30T22:08:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	hmm
2010-12-30T22:10:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	ok.. 1 sec
2010-12-30T22:12:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	actually,
2010-12-30T22:13:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	there is one really simple way... it is not a very posh/professional way, but it might work in a very simple way
2010-12-30T22:15:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	you can use the -d opption of apt-get
2010-12-30T22:15:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	just run 2 commands for each package you want to install... sudo apt-get install -d <package> and sudo apt-get build-dep -d <package>
2010-12-30T22:16:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	this will download all the debs that you need to /var/cache/apt/archives... just copy them all to a dvd and then on the new system, cd to the dvd and run sudo dpkg -i *.deb
2010-12-30T22:17:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	that will install everything from the dvd :)
2010-12-30T22:18:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	but i suggest listening to what sacarlson was telling you.. i have to sleep now :)
2010-12-30T22:18:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	i will be online tomorrow, i can help you with aptoncd then if you still need it :)
2010-12-30T22:18:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	so good luck :)
2010-12-30T22:18:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	:)
2010-12-30T22:28:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	remembered about this just as i was leaving and thought id tell you (i think this is what you are looking for) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Personal
2010-12-30T22:29:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	you create an offline repository and add it to your sources.list.. then you can install software from there using the predownloaded .deb's
2010-12-30T22:30:00.000Z	rs0832	bismay	k so you can try it.. if you cant do it, ill run you through it tomorrow...
