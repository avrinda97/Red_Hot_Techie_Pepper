2008-12-25T18:16:00.000Z	scensis		Hey, i've been searching on the net for a guide how to install wow (from CD's) with wine. But all the guides i've seen doesnt resemble anything like my wine. I followed one guide, that told me to go to Accerssories -> Wine File. But i dont have that. Can anyone help me?
2008-12-25T18:17:00.000Z	Yuji1	scensis	The Applications Places System Menu. Under Applications is usually a category called Accessories for older Wine installs. Mine is under Wine Emulator.
2008-12-25T18:18:00.000Z	scensis	Yuji1	I dont even have that
2008-12-25T18:18:00.000Z	Yuji1	scensis	Is Wine installed even ?
2008-12-25T18:19:00.000Z	scensis	Yuji1	Yes, i have under "Applications" a own Wine section. And from there i used to use Wine doors. But it wont let me install from my cd
2008-12-25T18:19:00.000Z	Yuji1	scensis	Install what from CD?
2008-12-25T18:20:00.000Z	scensis		Wow:P
2008-12-25T18:20:00.000Z	scensis		Or anything else
2008-12-25T18:21:00.000Z	scensis	Yuji1	Would it be wise to uninstall Wine and install it again?
2008-12-25T18:21:00.000Z	Yuji1	scensis	Try browsing the CD and double-clicking the exe. :/ Wine should run it. :/
2008-12-25T18:21:00.000Z	Yuji1	scensis	I don't see any probable change in Wine from reinstalling it.
2008-12-25T18:22:00.000Z	scensis	Yuji1	Thats the problem, the WOW cd dont have a exe file>< it only have those installer tome.mpq
2008-12-25T18:22:00.000Z	Yuji1		Are there any 'autorun.inf' files?
2008-12-25T18:23:00.000Z	Yuji1		It should say to automatically run (Windows determines what to run in a CD via that file) what program.
2008-12-25T18:25:00.000Z	scensis	Yuji1	When i use "Wine doors" and try "Install from CD" it wont even read the .mpq files=/
2008-12-25T18:25:00.000Z	Yuji1		Wine Doors?
2008-12-25T18:25:00.000Z	scensis		Yea, thats what it's called
2008-12-25T18:25:00.000Z	Yuji1		Ok, scensis copy the contents of autorun.inf (or whatever, ls the drive, file list) into pastebin.
2008-12-25T18:26:00.000Z	Yuji1		Wine Doors, never known it to go by that name.
2008-12-25T18:26:00.000Z	scensis	Yuji1	Yea, ill use some time to figure out all of that since im a beginner at ubuntu:p
2008-12-25T18:27:00.000Z	Yuji1	scensis	Well autorun.inf tells Windows what file to run. Opening it in gedit/text editor will show what file it runs (exe). Double-click (should execute with wine) the file and Wine will run it.
2008-12-25T18:28:00.000Z	scensis	Yuji1	Ok, thanks. Will try to locate autorun.inf
