2007-08-16T06:03:00.000Z	gvsa123		can anyone give info on how to view images from camstream remotely on a browser?
2007-08-16T06:04:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	you will need apache, then some Java applet that will do that
2007-08-16T06:06:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	are you being sarcastic ?
2007-08-16T06:07:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	ok, yes, you need to install a webserver, so your web browser can connect to
2007-08-16T06:07:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	there are two ways of 'uploading' the pics
2007-08-16T06:08:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	you could also upload the pics on flickr or whatever
2007-08-16T06:08:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	but I am sure there are internet apps that do that already
2007-08-16T06:09:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	no
2007-08-16T06:09:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	in that case I'd go hunting for some website that could do that
2007-08-16T06:09:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	although that's not much to do with ubuntu or even linux, but lemme check
2007-08-16T06:10:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	http://www.earthcam.com/
2007-08-16T06:11:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	http://webcam.com/
2007-08-16T06:11:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	just google for webcam and you'll find zillions of places where you could do that
2007-08-16T06:13:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	I'd say if you're using linux, you should get the cam running first :P
2007-08-16T06:13:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	NP
2007-08-16T06:14:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	great
2007-08-16T06:26:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	np :) later
2007-08-16T06:59:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	those are two different things
2007-08-16T07:00:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	vmware actually starts another virtual machine, letting you boot into windows
2007-08-16T07:01:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	no
2007-08-16T07:01:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	some things are just hard to emulate
2007-08-16T07:01:00.000Z	MindSpark	gvsa123	there's winex and there's crossover office
