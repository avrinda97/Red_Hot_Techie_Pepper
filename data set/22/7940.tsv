2005-11-29T11:40:00.000Z	blanky	onkarshinde	read above
2005-11-29T11:40:00.000Z	onkarshinde	blanky	You can put it anywhere. But I think you will have to modify the setting using GConf editor

2005-11-29T11:45:00.000Z	onkarshinde	blanky	Open gconf-editor (Applications->System Tools->Configuration Editor)
2005-11-29T11:47:00.000Z	onkarshinde	blanky	in conf editor go to apps->gnome-session
2005-11-29T11:48:00.000Z	blanky	onkarshinde	can you tell me where that folder is, splash
