2006-08-14T07:21:00.000Z	wide-eye	PurpleTen	md5sum /dev/cdrom/ and compare w/ the iso img
2006-08-14T07:22:00.000Z	wide-eye	PurpleTen	set nero to verify after write next time
2006-08-14T07:22:00.000Z	wide-eye	PurpleTen	unless you have some error msg you're holding out on us?
2006-08-14T07:29:00.000Z	wide-eye	PurpleTen	grab a md5sum program and check against the md5sum.txt in that file, numbers should match
2006-08-14T07:29:00.000Z	wide-eye	PurpleTen	check the iso image i mean
2006-08-14T07:30:00.000Z	wide-eye	PurpleTen	for which os?
2006-08-14T07:31:00.000Z	wide-eye	PurpleTen	dunno, suggest google md5sum gnu win32
2006-08-14T07:37:00.000Z	wide-eye	PurpleTen	unless you're on an old mac
2006-08-14T07:39:00.000Z	wide-eye	PurpleTen	isolinux is used to boot cd's instead of grub/lilo
2006-08-14T07:40:00.000Z	wide-eye	PurpleTen	there is an isolinux folder in that image you posted ;)
