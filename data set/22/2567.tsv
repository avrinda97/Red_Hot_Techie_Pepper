2009-06-10T08:16:00.000Z	Treyh		What ubuntu version would you recommend running on a virtualization setup, 64 bit server, 8 gigs of ram (desktop, server, 32 or 64 bit)
2009-06-10T08:17:00.000Z	fccf	Treyh	is this going into production - how stable do you need?
2009-06-10T08:17:00.000Z	Treyh	fccf	yes production, and the VM's will be 32 bit windows server 2003
2009-06-10T08:17:00.000Z	Treyh	fccf	i have about 2 weeks to test
2009-06-10T08:18:00.000Z	fccf	Treyh	use Hardy 8.04 32bit and virtualbox... how many servers?
2009-06-10T08:18:00.000Z	Treyh	fccf	currently using server 9.04 but seems to use a lot more memory than i expected. when I have 3 VM's running with 1.25gigs of memory each, the server uses 7 gigs of ram total
2009-06-10T08:18:00.000Z	Treyh	fccf	i'm also using vbox
2009-06-10T08:19:00.000Z	fccf	Treyh	How much swap do you have?
2009-06-10T08:20:00.000Z	Treyh	fccf	chose the defaults, top shows 5g
2009-06-10T08:20:00.000Z	fccf	Treyh	is any of it being used?
2009-06-10T08:20:00.000Z	Treyh	fccf	no and when i tried using 4 VM's, it maxed out the memory and did use swap, but the server basically froze
2009-06-10T08:22:00.000Z	fccf	Treyh	I personally think you will have much better luck with 8.04 as it is meant for servers and is supported until 2013 for servers
2009-06-10T08:22:00.000Z	Treyh	fccf	thank you, i have two of these servers, will try 8.04 on the second one tomorrow. desktop or server edition?
2009-06-10T08:23:00.000Z	fccf	Treyh	install the server version and then install ubuntu-desktop so you can use the GUI for setting up your servers ... but keep the server kernel
2009-06-10T08:23:00.000Z	Treyh	fccf	so sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop ?
2009-06-10T08:24:00.000Z	fccf	Treyh	yep after apt-get update
2009-06-11T00:51:00.000Z	Treyh	fccf	hey I switched to 8.04 64bit from 9.04 but still having the same problem, running just one vm seems to use all of my available memory
2009-06-11T00:51:00.000Z	fccf	Treyh	I thought you were using 32bit VM's
2009-06-11T00:52:00.000Z	Treyh	fccf	I am, but running a 64 bit server
2009-06-11T00:52:00.000Z	fccf	Treyh	you might try asking in #vbox
2009-06-11T00:52:00.000Z	Treyh	fccf	tried, no responses
2009-06-11T00:53:00.000Z	fccf	Treyh	running 32bit VM's in compatibility mode on a 64bit machine seems rather overkill.. I'd use 32bit
