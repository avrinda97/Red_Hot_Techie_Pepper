2010-08-24T21:15:00.000Z	besogon	churl	"figure out" - I don't know this expression. But To check if the package is installed I use the ubuntu software center
2010-08-24T21:15:00.000Z	besogon	churl	and the package was marked as installed one
2010-08-24T21:19:00.000Z	churl	besogon	ok, i had to install ubuntuone-client and then i found "ubuntu one" on the "start menu" under "settings"  (I am using xubuntu)
