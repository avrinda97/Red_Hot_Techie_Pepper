2009-09-28T16:11:00.000Z	lizzzy		Hey, so I'm installing ubuntu on sda2 (D:), it says that I have to allocate swap space
2009-09-28T16:11:00.000Z	lizzzy		What do i do to allocate swap space?
2009-09-28T16:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	you create a partition for it, it is part of the install process
2009-09-28T16:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	those definitions mean nothing to linux
2009-09-28T16:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	linux sees partitons, not drive letters
2009-09-28T16:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	if you are using wubi then you will make an image oon the partition of your choice
2009-09-28T16:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	if D: as you call it is a second physical drive you can use a proper install and resize / wipe the drive clean to be 100% ubuntu
2009-09-28T16:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	wiping it will loose all data on the disks partitions
2009-09-28T16:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	you can resize ntfs to make room for the partitions for Ubuntu, or you can delete a partition to make space
2009-09-28T16:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	anoter way is to use wubi to install Ubuntu into the NTFS partitions and you dont have to mess with any partitions
2009-09-30T17:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	do you want a shortcut to your docs sat on the desktop?
2009-09-30T17:34:00.000Z	lizzzy	ActionParsnip	No, I just want a link to my home folder on my desktop.
2009-09-30T17:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	cd ~/Desktop; ln -s $HOME .
2009-09-30T17:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	that will do it
2009-11-03T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	will it run from terminal?
2009-11-03T17:21:00.000Z	lizzzy	ActionParsnip	$opera --> opera: command not found
2009-11-03T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	did you run: sudo apt-get -i opera_deb_file_name.deb; sudo apt-get -f install
2009-11-03T17:21:00.000Z	lizzzy	ActionParsnip	I just downloaded and double clicked the .deb package.
2009-11-03T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	you need to use that command to install the deb, the -f install will satisfy the deps it has
2009-11-03T17:21:00.000Z	lizzzy	ActionParsnip	Oh ok
2009-11-03T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	i'd use the command line, you can see whats going on then
2009-11-03T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lizzzy	gui methods are nice but when stuff doesnt work you dont gte nice outputs like cli does
