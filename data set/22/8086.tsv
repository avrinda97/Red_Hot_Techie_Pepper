2007-06-01T05:20:00.000Z	Nick_Hill		Open question on forum: Is anyone else here having trouble with users crontabs? ie do crontab -e then add a cron line * * * * * /bin/date >/tmp/date  . Please let me know if you DON'T get a file called date in /tmp containing the date.
2007-06-01T05:22:00.000Z	mwe	Nick_Hill	is it configured to allow user crontabs? or maybe you're running anacron
2007-06-01T05:23:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	mwe	 ooks like I am using vixie according to the manual.
2007-06-01T05:24:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	mwe	I have tried creating cron.allow and cron.deny. Then adding my username to cron.allow.
2007-06-01T05:24:00.000Z	mwe	Nick_Hill	I think there is a directive that decides if user crontabs are allowed or ignored
2007-06-01T05:24:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	mwe	Do you know how it is set on feisty by default, and where it is set?
2007-06-01T05:25:00.000Z	mwe	Nick_Hill	not really. I just think I remember seeing it somewhere
2007-06-01T05:28:00.000Z	mwe	Nick_Hill	so I guess you already checked syslog?
2007-06-01T05:29:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	mwe	Yes. cron writes to syslog. Unfortunately, the debugging output is limited.
2007-06-01T05:30:00.000Z	mwe	Nick_Hill	but you would have noticed any errors at least
2007-06-01T05:31:00.000Z	mwe	Nick_Hill	make sure you leave a blank line at the end of the file IIRC
2007-06-01T05:32:00.000Z	mwe	Nick_Hill	have you done that?
2007-06-01T05:33:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	mwe	I am just checking if that is the problem. Could be.
2007-06-01T05:39:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	mwe	It looks like the new line at the end of the file is the issue
2007-06-01T05:40:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	mwe	I use Jed as my default editor. Jed doesn't automatically add a new line before EOF. nano, the Ubuntu defautl editor always leaves \n before <eof>
2007-06-01T05:42:00.000Z	mwe	Nick_Hill	right. it's been like that for years, thouh.
2007-06-01T05:42:00.000Z	mwe	Nick_Hill	should definately be fixed, though.
2007-06-01T05:43:00.000Z	mwe	Nick_Hill	very hard to spot otherwise unless you know
2007-06-01T05:43:00.000Z	mwe	Nick_Hill	sure
2007-06-01T05:44:00.000Z	mwe	Nick_Hill	it's a bug that should have been fixed years ago
2007-06-01T05:44:00.000Z	mwe	Nick_Hill	crontab -e should complain or add the blank line
2007-06-01T05:45:00.000Z	mwe	Nick_Hill	I've made it a habit to leave a blank line at the end of most config files ;)
