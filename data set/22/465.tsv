2011-09-20T21:43:00.000Z	nuclearworm	idlemind	, im trying to follow a mix of two tutorials i ve found in the net but unfortunately i dont have the knowledge enough i suppose
2011-09-20T21:44:00.000Z	idlemind	nuclearworm	link me those tutorials i would like to look them over. a bios update is vendor specific (hp,dell, or mobo manufacturer) so it should be an interesting trick if someone has a workaround

2011-09-20T21:47:00.000Z	idlemind	nuclearworm	you have a fdd and a disk still? or you trying to apply this to a usb drive ?
2011-09-20T21:48:00.000Z	nuclearworm	idlemind	, im trying to apply it to a floppy drive
2011-09-20T21:50:00.000Z	idlemind	nuclearworm	what commands in that first tutorial are giving you trouble?
2011-09-20T21:50:00.000Z	nuclearworm	idlemind	, the unmounting one , im not able to see the created directory
2011-09-20T21:51:00.000Z	idlemind	nuclearworm	is the device still mounted? run just "mount" and look for /tmp/floppy in that list
2011-09-20T21:52:00.000Z	idlemind		also nuclearworm can you copy and paste the exact error the umount command gives you?
2011-09-20T21:54:00.000Z	nuclearworm	idlemind	, i havent explained me well, after unmounting i couldn t see /tmp/floppy anymore so ive runned the first command again maybe i shouldn t have done that
2011-09-20T21:54:00.000Z	idlemind		o that is a natural side effect of umounting /tmp/floppy
2011-09-20T21:54:00.000Z	idlemind		when you issue that umount command it is going to save the changes back into that fdoem.144 file
2011-09-20T21:54:00.000Z	idlemind		so now you need to either write fdoem.144 to a cd or a floppy
2011-09-20T21:55:00.000Z	idlemind		my guess for a floppy you would do: dd if=/path/to/FDOEM.144.gz of=/dev/fd0
2011-09-20T21:56:00.000Z	nuclearworm	idlemind	, so is the fdoem.144 changed , i mean does it have the added files?
2011-09-20T21:57:00.000Z	idlemind		yes if you issued the copy commands to put the files you need into the image
2011-09-20T21:57:00.000Z	idlemind		prior to umount'ing the virtual device
2011-09-20T21:58:00.000Z	idlemind		nenel audio and video are broad topics what are you looking for specifically
2011-09-20T21:58:00.000Z	nuclearworm	idlemind	, ok  im going to try what you ve told me , thanks
2011-09-20T21:59:00.000Z	idlemind	nuclearworm	gl have fun
