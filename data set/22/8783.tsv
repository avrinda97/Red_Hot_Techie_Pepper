2005-11-20T13:02:00.000Z	bubba		grrr... how do I change my password? it wont let me. has someone changed it for me?
2005-11-20T13:02:00.000Z	nalioth	bubba	if you've lost it, visit #freenode
2005-11-20T13:40:00.000Z	bubba	nalioth	thanks... ill check that...
2005-11-20T13:17:00.000Z	nalioth	bubba	join #freenode and ask them. they control the horizontal and vertical hold here
2005-11-20T13:18:00.000Z	nalioth	bubba	you wait like the rest of us. they'll give you voice in a few minutes (thanks to the spambots, they do it that way)
2005-11-20T13:19:00.000Z	bubba	nalioth	its been a while... prolly atleast 10 minutes...
2005-11-20T13:20:00.000Z	nalioth	bubba	patience, sometimes i have to wait a long time
2005-11-20T13:27:00.000Z	nalioth	bubba	we cannot help you in here with your password, you are gonna have to wait in #freenode and ask them
2005-11-20T13:28:00.000Z	bubba	nalioth	yes. I understand, im still waiting in #freenode, with 2 sessions, and usernames... still no help there. thats why I thought, hey, why dont i ask about my original problem (you know, why I came in here half an hour ago!)
2005-11-20T13:29:00.000Z	nalioth	bubba	why are there in another session?
2005-11-20T13:30:00.000Z	bubba	nalioth	because i can. because i have the password working for that one. why is it important?
2005-11-20T13:30:00.000Z	nalioth	bubba	why dont you have your nicks linked?
2005-11-20T13:31:00.000Z	bubba	nalioth	because im trying ubuntu linux, and i want to play games on yahoo games.
2005-11-20T13:31:00.000Z	nalioth	bubba	that has nothing to do with linking your nicknames on freenode
2005-11-20T13:31:00.000Z	bubba	nalioth	i understand. do you.
2005-11-20T13:32:00.000Z	nalioth	bubba	i do not. but to each their own
2005-11-20T13:32:00.000Z	bubba	nalioth	what im saying, is im trying to play some games on yahoo, but i cnat seem to using ubuntu. thats what I want to do... not do irc.
2005-11-20T13:33:00.000Z	nalioth	bubba	i'm still trying to figure out your freenode password thing
2005-11-20T13:40:00.000Z	nalioth	bubba	you are voiced in #freenode now
2005-11-20T13:41:00.000Z	bubba	nalioth	yes. I just asked... thanks :)
2005-11-20T14:54:00.000Z	nalioth	bubba	in a terminal, type "update-alternatives --list java"
2005-11-20T14:54:00.000Z	nalioth	bubba	paste the output into #flood
