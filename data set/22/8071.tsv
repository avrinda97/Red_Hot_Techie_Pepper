2006-09-16T10:25:00.000Z	pipegeek		Hi, folks!
2006-09-16T10:25:00.000Z	pipegeek		Did the nvidia kernel module just break in dapper, or am I crazy?
2006-09-16T10:25:00.000Z	pipegeek		"unknown symbol boot_cpu_data", and "disagrees about version number of boot_cpu_data" in dmesg
2006-09-16T10:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pipegeek	 it seems to be working for me.. oor was there a new update recently?
2006-09-16T10:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pipegeek	 that sounds/looks like some sort of version conflict to me.
2006-09-16T10:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pipegeek	 let me update/upgrade and see :)
2006-09-16T10:27:00.000Z	pipegeek	Dr_Willis	thanks
2006-09-16T10:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pipegeek	 what kernel are you using right now? (uname -a)
2006-09-16T10:28:00.000Z	pipegeek	Dr_Willis	err, sorry for not addressing that to you
2006-09-16T10:28:00.000Z	pipegeek	Dr_Willis	crap, I have to disappear for a moment; I'll be back in 15 minutes or so.  Thanks for the help.
2006-09-16T10:53:00.000Z	pipegeek	Dr_Willis	I'm back, but briefly
2006-09-16T10:53:00.000Z	pipegeek	Dr_Willis	(thanks again)
2006-09-16T10:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pipegeek	 i see no new kernel updates or anything to update/upgrade
2006-09-16T10:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pipegeek	 so im not sure how things got broke
2006-09-16T10:54:00.000Z	pipegeek	Dr_Willis	Well, phooey
2006-09-16T10:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pipegeek	 i did see a url once that detailed how to rebuild/use the latest nvidia stuff from nvidia. but ive never done so.
2006-09-16T10:55:00.000Z	pipegeek	Dr_Willis	I could give that a shot.  It's just odd; I mean, I did do an update yesterday, but obviously you're also at the latest update without problems.  But I've also done a rebuild myself, to no avail
2006-09-16T10:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pipegeek	 ive done so much to this system im suprised it works.. but ive never had any issues with the kernel/nvidia stuff
2006-09-16T10:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pipegeek	 could remove --purge the packages and reinstall them. i guess
2006-09-16T10:56:00.000Z	pipegeek	Dr_Willis	Did that
2006-09-16T10:59:00.000Z	pipegeek	Dr_Willis	I guess I'll give that a shot
2006-09-16T11:00:00.000Z	pipegeek	Dr_Willis	I appreciate the help, though.  Toodle-oo
