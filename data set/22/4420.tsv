2009-11-22T19:58:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dreth	is it turned on?
2009-11-22T19:59:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dreth	yeah, is the E6400 a laptop?
2009-11-22T20:00:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dreth	does you wireless car work for ubuntu?
2009-11-22T20:02:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dreth	so you can connect to the internet via ubuntu and yoru wi-fi card.
2009-11-22T20:04:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dreth	how do you turn your wifi card on/off?
2009-11-22T20:05:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dreth	I would suggest going to a terminal and try sudo iwlist wlan0 scan, and see if it gives you an error.
2009-11-22T20:07:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dreth	try sudo ifconfig wlan0 up then do the iwlist cmd again.
2009-11-22T20:10:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dreth	when you do sudo ifconfig what interfaces do you get.
2009-11-22T20:11:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dreth	just ifconfig
2009-11-22T20:11:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dreth	what interfaces are available?
2009-11-22T20:13:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dreth	ETH0 is that you wired interface?
2009-11-22T20:18:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dreth	how about the hardware manager, maybe there is a restricted driver for you wifi card.
2009-11-22T20:21:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dreth	sure hardware drivers.
2009-11-22T20:25:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dreth	its really odd that it doesn't appear on your restricted drivers.
2009-11-22T20:28:00.000Z	odinsbane	Dreth	 did you ever paste your lspci results?
