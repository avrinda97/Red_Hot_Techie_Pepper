2009-10-19T12:53:00.000Z	Appiah	surfzoid	I dont understand how an iso could be better then another one?
2009-10-19T12:54:00.000Z	Appiah		I dont see what that has to do with the USB Creator tool at all

2009-10-19T12:54:00.000Z	Appiah		check the box and use the slider to select how much space you want to use
2009-10-19T12:55:00.000Z	Appiah		if you dont like it you can just download another iso and use it
2009-10-19T12:55:00.000Z	Appiah		It's not like a CD-R which you cant change
2009-10-19T12:55:00.000Z	Appiah		I never used a netbook so I cant say good or bad about it
