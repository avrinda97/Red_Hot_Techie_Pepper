2008-01-26T20:44:00.000Z	mohbana		how old is ubunut 7.10
2008-01-26T20:44:00.000Z	mohbana		could it be that i downloading the 32bit version instead of the 64bit?
2008-01-26T20:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mohbana	7.10= Oct 07, 8.04(next version), April 08
2008-01-27T08:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mohbana	do you have nvidia settings installed?
2008-01-27T08:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mohbana	no, nvidia-settings is what you use to setup your nvidia card(resolution, etc.)
2008-01-27T08:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mohbana	and there's no where on there to change the res?
2008-01-27T08:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mohbana	hmm,
2008-01-27T08:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mohbana	i really don't know, something isn't making sense.
2008-01-27T08:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mohbana	are you running nvidia-settings as root?
2008-01-27T08:24:00.000Z	mohbana	IndyGunFreak	yes it prompts for psswrod
2008-01-27T08:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mohbana	ok, i was thinking maybe thats why it wasn't letting you change.
2008-01-27T08:26:00.000Z	mohbana	IndyGunFreak	i used envy by the way
2008-01-27T08:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mohbana	well, thats a bad idea, but pointless at this point.
2008-01-27T08:27:00.000Z	mohbana	IndyGunFreak	i couldnt get it to work without it
2008-01-27T08:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mohbana	well, from the sounds of it, its not working with it...
2008-01-27T08:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mohbana	now you just have to worry about envy wrecking something
2008-01-27T08:38:00.000Z	mohbana	IndyGunFreak	why do you say that?
2008-01-27T08:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mohbana	Envy has hosed more than one system, thats why it isn't supported
2008-01-27T08:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mohbana	kinda like automjatix.
2008-01-27T08:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mohbana	you have to do that while you're installing Ubuntu, by setting a different partition for home.
2008-01-27T08:55:00.000Z	mohbana	IndyGunFreak	so its to late to do it now?
2008-01-27T08:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mohbana	most likely
