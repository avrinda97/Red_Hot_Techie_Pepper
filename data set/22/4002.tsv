2008-04-11T08:32:00.000Z	Sam827		when I try to boot ubuntu, it tells me please insert bootable media
2008-04-11T08:33:00.000Z	Sam827		any ideas?
2008-04-11T08:33:00.000Z	bazhang	Sam827	disable the cd media as a repo source then try again after refreshing/reloading your sources
2008-04-11T08:37:00.000Z	bazhang	Sam827	you tried what I suggested yet? please pastebin your sources.list to see if that is the issue
2008-04-11T08:40:00.000Z	bazhang	Sam827	until you do the steps we recommend then no real help possible
2008-04-11T08:40:00.000Z	Sam827	bazhang	wat steps? I may have missed them
2008-04-11T08:41:00.000Z	bazhang	Sam827	does your irc client have the scroll up function?
2008-04-11T08:42:00.000Z	bazhang	Sam827	have to step out, perhaps someone can help you to disable cd media from your sources list
2008-04-11T08:44:00.000Z	Sam827	bazhang	can you repost the steps
2008-04-12T06:17:00.000Z	Sam827	bazhang	I've been trying, but nothing is working
2008-04-12T06:17:00.000Z	bazhang	Sam827	there is a website called ubuntu-tutorials.com that has more on that
2008-04-12T06:17:00.000Z	Sam827	bazhang	thanks
2008-04-12T06:20:00.000Z	Sam827	bazhang	It only says what the ubuntu forum says
2008-04-12T06:21:00.000Z	bazhang	Sam827	what is that? which site?
2008-04-12T06:21:00.000Z	Sam827	bazhang	you reffered me to ubuntu-tutorials.com
2008-04-12T06:22:00.000Z	bazhang	Sam827	unless you give some specific details of what you have tried, what worked and what did not, and what errors you have gotten, then you might not get much help here
2008-04-12T06:23:00.000Z	Sam827	bazhang	My trackpad can't right click, my muc doesn't work, my wifi doesnt work
2008-04-12T06:23:00.000Z	Sam827	bazhang	thats it i think
2008-04-12T06:24:00.000Z	Sam827	bazhang	i never get errors, it just doesnt work
2008-04-12T06:25:00.000Z	bazhang	Sam827	all of this problems are eminently fixable; many folks run ubuntu well on their macbooks/macbook pros; the first order of business is always wifi though
2008-04-12T06:25:00.000Z	Sam827	bazhang	OK
2008-04-12T06:32:00.000Z	Sam827	bazhang	can you help me get wifi working?
