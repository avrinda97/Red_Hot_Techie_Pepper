2005-10-21T09:25:00.000Z	dabaR	nomad111	how would you like it set up?
2005-10-21T09:25:00.000Z	nomad111	dabaR	i want to set windows to my default boot
2005-10-21T09:26:00.000Z	dabaR	nomad111	ok, I think I can tell you how to do that. So you just want windows to boot by default instead of ubuntu? if so, please in a terminal type cat /boot/grub/menu.lst and paste the ouptut of that to pastebin.ubuntulinux.nl then I will tell you what next.
2005-10-21T09:28:00.000Z	nomad111	dabaR	i posted
2005-10-21T09:30:00.000Z	dabaR	nomad111	just a sec, I stopped my gdm for some reason a moment ago, let me get started up.
2005-10-21T09:30:00.000Z	nomad111	dabaR	take ur time
2005-10-21T09:33:00.000Z	dabaR	nomad111	OK, see the default 0 in the top of your /boot/grub/menu.list file?
2005-10-21T09:39:00.000Z	dabaR	nomad111	just prepend your post to me with my nick, irssi has higlighting for that, and I use irssi. OK,  well, that means that the first boot entry in your menu.lst file is used to be the default. you need to set it to the number that the windows installation is. I think it is 6 so make default 6, then try rebooting, please.
