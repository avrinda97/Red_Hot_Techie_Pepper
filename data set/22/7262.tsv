2007-09-13T11:28:00.000Z	amr		I have a question about what happened today in updates of "adding ATI "to compiz-fusion black list
2007-09-13T11:28:00.000Z	ikonia	amr	you said that question about 6 lines up
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	amr	initng is a different init system, its not currently part of ubuntu nor is it planned as ubuntu users upstart
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	amr	ikonia	, which is better?
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	amr	its personal opinion
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	amr	ikonia	, which is faster boot
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	amr	depends on your system
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	amr	and how the distro is put together
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	amr	ikonia	, so you advice me to stick to ubuntu default upstart
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	amr	ikonia	, that is good
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	amr	I advise you to not try to change init systems unless you are VERY strong with linux
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	amr	ikonia	, i have another question about kernel upgrade and kernel performance patches
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	amr	ask if your question is related to ubuntu
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	amr	ikonia	, can i know why ?
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	amr	only people who know a LOT about a linux distribution should build their own kernels, there are some clever people on the ubuntu team - and they know better than you
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	amr	the kernel is not for playing around
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	amr	ikonia	, thank you!
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	amr	ikonia	, ikonw but i use linux for fun and education not as a platform
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	amr	#gentoo will help you with that
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	amr	ikonia	, i failed to get support with my problem and thier forum isn't as good as ubuntu
2007-09-13T13:09:00.000Z	amr	ikonia	it's something about a problem with kernel support to my IDE
