2012-11-08T05:15:00.000Z	yeats	Muska	can you pastebin the errors?
2012-11-08T05:16:00.000Z	Muska	yeats	I have a picture of the console to give you an idea of some of the output
2012-11-08T05:16:00.000Z	yeats		ok
2012-11-08T05:16:00.000Z	Muska		http://geo.animounted.net/xenconsole.png
2012-11-08T05:16:00.000Z	Muska		stuff like that just flies up the screen
2012-11-08T05:17:00.000Z	Muska		also nothing new is popping up in dmesg after I boot so I'm thinking it's just something broken with the console
2012-11-08T05:18:00.000Z	yeats	Muska	so you don't see those messages with 'tail -f /var/log/dmesg'?
2012-11-08T05:18:00.000Z	yeats	Muska	that partial screenshot doesn't provide enough information I'm afraid
2012-11-08T05:18:00.000Z	Muska	yeats	typing that command shows me this: http://pastie.org/5343248
2012-11-08T05:20:00.000Z	yeats	Muska	but the messages don't continue, correct?
2012-11-08T05:20:00.000Z	Muska	yeats	correct
2012-11-08T05:20:00.000Z	yeats		hmm
2012-11-08T05:20:00.000Z	Muska		here is another screenshot I jsut took now http://geo.animounted.net/xenconsole1.png
2012-11-08T05:21:00.000Z	yeats	Muska	and the terminal is continuing to fill with messages even after boot? (just confirming)
2012-11-08T05:22:00.000Z	Muska	yeats	that is correct.  It doesn't seem like they are new messages just a lot of old ones repeating on the screen in a chaotic manner.  This only started happening after I performed the steps to install Xen
2012-11-08T05:22:00.000Z	Muska		I literally copy and pasted from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Xen right up to the reboot part
2012-11-08T05:23:00.000Z	yeats	Muska	any info in any of the other logs? (syslog, kern.log, etc.)
2012-11-08T05:24:00.000Z	Muska	yeats	nothing that seems relevant.
2012-11-08T05:25:00.000Z	yeats	Muska	hmm - and the numbers in the brackets (e.g. [   1.199179]) are not climbing? or are they?
2012-11-08T05:26:00.000Z	Muska	yeats	I will watch for a while to see if they are
2012-11-08T05:28:00.000Z	Muska	yeats	they numbers have not climbed however I did see some smaller numbers on a few screenshots, nothing bigger though
2012-11-08T05:28:00.000Z	yeats	Muska	huh
