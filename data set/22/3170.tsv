2009-03-06T14:03:00.000Z	Kartagis		hello
2009-03-06T14:03:00.000Z	Kartagis		i am trying to umount the samba shares at poweroff. I found a script for it and wrote it in /etc/init.d/ then I made a symbolic link with ln -s ../init.d/umountsmb K15umountsmb in /etc/rc2.d/ but it doesn't seem to work. how come?
2009-03-06T14:04:00.000Z	r3dux	Kartagis	do you need to unmount samba shares? It's just a network connection.. surely it just terminates the connection when you power down?
2009-03-06T14:05:00.000Z	Kartagis	r3dux	when I poweroff, it waits soooo long
2009-03-06T14:07:00.000Z	Kartagis	r3dux	what can I do?
2009-03-06T14:07:00.000Z	r3dux	Kartagis	what do you have connected?
2009-03-06T14:07:00.000Z	Kartagis	r3dux	3 samba shares
2009-03-06T14:08:00.000Z	r3dux	Kartagis	if you don't have any samba shares does it close down real quick?
2009-03-06T14:08:00.000Z	Kartagis	r3dux	yes
2009-03-06T14:09:00.000Z	r3dux	Kartagis	I'd try with each share separately, see if it's just one of the samba connections that's glitching

2009-03-06T14:11:00.000Z	r3dux	Kartagis	Not specifing uid and gid? Odd... Can I have:
2009-03-06T14:13:00.000Z	Kartagis	r3dux	does that effect things?
2009-03-06T14:17:00.000Z	r3dux	Kartagis	um, none? I don't think it "drops down" from 5...
2009-03-06T14:28:00.000Z	r3dux	Kartagis	I'm watching this w/ interest... hope you sort it :)
2009-03-06T14:29:00.000Z	Kartagis	r3dux	can I just delete S?? ?
2009-03-06T14:37:00.000Z	Kartagis	r3dux	no luck
2009-03-06T14:37:00.000Z	Kartagis	r3dux	http://pastebin.com/f1c6ffdf8 is the script
2009-03-06T14:39:00.000Z	Kartagis	r3dux	I get CIFS: VFS: server not responding
2009-03-06T14:40:00.000Z	r3dux	Kartagis	have you tried NOT unmounting the samba shares?
2009-03-06T14:41:00.000Z	Kartagis	r3dux	yes, that's why I am trying to
2009-03-06T16:42:00.000Z	Kartagis	r3dux	I found the script I was looking for :)
