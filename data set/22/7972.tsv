2008-04-06T11:14:00.000Z	recon	zm	cs?
2008-04-06T11:14:00.000Z	recon	zm	you'll want to use wine.
2008-04-06T11:15:00.000Z	recon	zm	does it end with .exe?
2008-04-06T11:15:00.000Z	recon	zm	odd. you are referring to counter-strike, I assume.
2008-04-06T11:16:00.000Z	recon	zm	download steam, run with wine.
2008-04-06T11:16:00.000Z	recon	zm	yeah, it's the only method that works, for the most part.
2008-04-06T11:17:00.000Z	recon	zm	wine lets you run windows apps. steam is a windows app.
2008-04-06T11:22:00.000Z	recon	zm	under the "applications" menu, there's a link that says "add/remove software".
2008-04-06T11:23:00.000Z	recon	zm	for more selection and in-depth choices and complication, use synaptic package manager, under "system>preferences".
2008-04-06T11:24:00.000Z	recon	zm	scattered.
2008-04-06T11:25:00.000Z	recon	zm	a .deb debian package contains the files, and they go to their respective places. like /usr/share/something/ for runnable parts, /usr/bin/ for the executable, /etc/something/ or ~/.something/ for config files, etc.
2008-04-06T11:25:00.000Z	recon	zm	it seems messy, but the package manager keeps everyhting in place.
2008-04-06T11:27:00.000Z	recon	zm	a lot more organized.
2008-04-06T11:27:00.000Z	recon	zm	doesn't depend on individual installers and registry access, one package manager manages everything.
2008-04-06T11:27:00.000Z	recon	zm	usually, executables don't have an extension.
2008-04-06T11:27:00.000Z	recon	zm	you'll know if they are executable if they have the "executable" property.
2008-04-06T11:31:00.000Z	recon	zm	i'll need a little more information.
2008-04-06T11:31:00.000Z	recon	zm	I've never seen that message.
2008-04-06T11:32:00.000Z	recon	zm	odds are, #wine is better suited.
2008-04-06T11:32:00.000Z	recon	zm	they run the whole wine gamut.
2008-04-06T11:32:00.000Z	recon	zm	ok, #winehq. i stand corrected.
