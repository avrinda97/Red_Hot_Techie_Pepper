2008-07-19T05:35:00.000Z	nikin		how can i see what process is using buffer and cache  in memory?
2008-07-19T05:35:00.000Z	Baughn	nikin	Those areas aren't associated with particular processes
2008-07-19T05:36:00.000Z	nikin	Baughn	i see but something is filling my RAM .. and i want to know what it is
2008-07-19T05:37:00.000Z	Baughn	nikin	Um, yeah. Cache. This is a /good/ thing.
2008-07-19T05:37:00.000Z	Baughn	nikin	Memory that's marked as "free" might as well be marked as "burning power with no benefit to you"
2008-07-19T05:37:00.000Z	nikin	Baughn	i see but there is no reason for such an amount of uffers and cache the servers load is technicaly zero
2008-07-19T05:38:00.000Z	Baughn	nikin	Exactly
2008-07-19T05:38:00.000Z	Baughn	nikin	Cache is what linux used memory for if it can't figure out something better to do with it
2008-07-19T05:39:00.000Z	Baughn	nikin	And it /will/ fill all of memory if you let things run long enough. This is /good/. It means any disk reads that have happened before will be memory reads instead.
2008-07-19T05:39:00.000Z	nikin	Baughn	i understand but what is in that cache?
2008-07-19T05:39:00.000Z	Baughn	nikin	Stuff linux read from disk earlier
2008-07-19T05:40:00.000Z	nikin	Baughn	if i understand you right linux uses all free memory for disk cache?
2008-07-19T05:40:00.000Z	Baughn	nikin	Yes
2008-07-19T05:40:00.000Z	nikin	Baughn	is there a way to flush that?
2008-07-19T05:40:00.000Z	Baughn	nikin	Why would you want to?
2008-07-19T05:41:00.000Z	nikin	Baughn	to see how much memory i get freed
2008-07-19T05:41:00.000Z	Baughn	nikin	Um. Just count the "cache" tag in free as free memory.
2008-07-19T05:41:00.000Z	Baughn	nikin	Cache /is/ free memory, effectively. It can be dropped on the floor in a heartbeat, since the same data is on disk it can just be read back in at need.
2008-07-19T05:42:00.000Z	Baughn	nikin	Oh, and incidentally, any programs that still have an existence on disk run from cache. Remove the cache, and they'd have to read the executable back in.
2008-07-19T05:42:00.000Z	nikin	Baughn	i understand that :)
2008-07-19T05:44:00.000Z	Baughn	nikin	I doubt all of that 900MB is for cache
2008-07-19T05:44:00.000Z	Baughn	nikin	Run free. See what is what.
