2009-09-01T09:53:00.000Z	Burf		what about runing windows programs - i would need VB6 access - is that possible?
2009-09-01T09:53:00.000Z	Burf		emulator?
2009-09-01T09:54:00.000Z	Burf		is it fast?
2009-09-01T09:54:00.000Z	Burf		does it require you install windows on the machine too?
2009-09-01T09:55:00.000Z	Burf		i have legit windows yeah
2009-09-01T09:56:00.000Z	Burf		i have windows - but im interested in swapping to linux (poss. ubuntu) but as i have a few long term projects in VB6 i would need to be able to run it in linux
2009-09-01T09:58:00.000Z	Burf		im not complaining - and i dont need to port to another language thank you
2009-09-01T09:58:00.000Z	Burf		is momo and wine free too?
2009-09-01T10:00:00.000Z	Burf		probly a bad idea conding a windows program in linux anyway
2009-09-01T10:00:00.000Z	Burf		can you install windows and linux on the same machine and choose OS on boot up - can that be done?
2009-09-01T10:01:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Burf	yes, it's called dual-booting.
2009-09-01T10:01:00.000Z	Burf		is dual booting fast, i imagine i can only have 1 os running at the same time yes?
2009-09-01T10:01:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Burf	correct. and yes, it's fast.
2009-09-01T10:02:00.000Z	Burf		sounds more and more tempting
2009-09-01T10:02:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Burf	not much to lose in trying it, really.
2009-09-01T10:02:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Burf	time, only.
2009-09-01T10:02:00.000Z	Burf		true - so long as i dont have to format my HDD to instal it and it can run beside my current OS
2009-09-01T10:04:00.000Z	Burf		oh and simcity4 i see can be ran in wine
2009-09-01T10:04:00.000Z	Burf	Royall	how do i go about it?
2009-09-01T10:04:00.000Z	Burf		does my bios have to support it?
2009-09-01T10:04:00.000Z	Burf		i.e how do i select my OS
2009-09-01T10:04:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Burf	a menu appears.
