2007-10-23T00:39:00.000Z	flick	youknowme	oh ok
2007-10-23T00:42:00.000Z	flick	youknowme	i must say, etherape is cool :)
2007-10-23T00:43:00.000Z	youknowme	flick	I know ain't it?!?! lol, its a little hard on resources though :(
2007-10-23T00:43:00.000Z	flick	youknowme	can it show a download/upload vs time graph?
2007-10-23T00:44:00.000Z	youknowme	flick	you know? I'm not quite sure.. I would think..
2007-10-23T00:48:00.000Z	flick	youknowme	try gkrellm, it's good too
2007-10-23T00:48:00.000Z	youknowme	flick	ok hold on, I'll give it a try
2007-10-23T00:49:00.000Z	youknowme	flick	I no can find it in add/remove..
2007-10-23T00:50:00.000Z	flick	youknowme	it's there in synaptic package manger, or you can "sudo apt-get install gkrellm" it's about 2mb download
2007-10-23T00:50:00.000Z	flick	youknowme	it even shows temperature of my cpu, gpu!
2007-10-23T00:50:00.000Z	youknowme	flick	no way get out!!! lol
2007-10-23T00:51:00.000Z	flick	youknowme	you know?! it's true!
2007-10-23T00:55:00.000Z	youknowme	flick	hmm, it doesn't wanna let me enable temp monitoring...
2007-10-23T00:56:00.000Z	flick	youknowme	i suppose either you have to run as root (sudo gkrellm) or it doesn't know about your motherboard
2007-10-23T00:56:00.000Z	youknowme	flick	oh... that makes sense lol. 1 sec
2007-10-23T00:57:00.000Z	youknowme	flick	Hmm. still no go, oh well I'll try at it later, not worth the effort atm. it DOES look cool though lol
2007-10-23T00:59:00.000Z	youknowme	flick	I brb
