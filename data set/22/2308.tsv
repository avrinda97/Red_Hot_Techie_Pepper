2010-11-18T07:26:00.000Z	electrofreak		so... how do I get rid of the gnome-panel?
2010-11-18T07:27:00.000Z	xrdodrx	electrofreak	why on earth would you want to do that? o_O
2010-11-18T07:28:00.000Z	electrofreak	xrdodrx	awn
2010-11-18T07:29:00.000Z	xrdodrx	electrofreak	well, you could "killall gnome-panel"
2010-11-18T07:29:00.000Z	electrofreak	xrdodrx	comes right back
2010-11-18T07:31:00.000Z	xrdodrx	electrofreak	ok, sorry, never really done this. I found a solution though.
2010-11-18T07:31:00.000Z	xrdodrx	electrofreak	System>Preferences>Sessions...
2010-11-18T07:33:00.000Z	electrofreak	xrdodrx	yea.... I found several websites suggesting that... I don't have that menu item.
2010-11-18T07:33:00.000Z	xrdodrx	electrofreak	nevermind, that's for an old version. spoke too soon
2010-11-18T07:33:00.000Z	xrdodrx	electrofreak	type "gconf-editor" into a terminal
2010-11-18T07:34:00.000Z	xrdodrx	electrofreak	you there?
2010-11-18T07:34:00.000Z	electrofreak	xrdodrx	yes
2010-11-18T07:34:00.000Z	xrdodrx	electrofreak	ok, click the "desktop" folder, than "gnome", then "session"
2010-11-18T07:35:00.000Z	electrofreak	xrdodrx	kk
2010-11-18T07:35:00.000Z	xrdodrx	electrofreak	click required_components, right-click panel and press "unset key"
2010-11-18T07:36:00.000Z	xrdodrx	electrofreak	now you should be able to kill gnome-panel
2010-11-18T07:37:00.000Z	electrofreak	xrdodrx	ok. unset key doesn't seem to do anything
2010-11-18T07:38:00.000Z	xrdodrx	electrofreak	does the "delete" key on the keyboard do anything?
2010-11-18T07:38:00.000Z	xrdodrx	electrofreak	good idea, but that's where it'll be
2010-11-18T07:38:00.000Z	xrdodrx	electrofreak	sorry, I did everything on my end up to "unset key" b/c obviously I don't want to unset key
2010-11-18T07:39:00.000Z	electrofreak	xrdodrx	kk. I'll take it from here. I was just seeing if anyone had a simple "oh yea.... all you do is...."
2010-11-18T07:39:00.000Z	xrdodrx	electrofreak	alright, have fun :D
