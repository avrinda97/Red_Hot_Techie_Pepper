2006-06-23T09:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Ackeubu_	ps ax
2006-06-23T09:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Ackeubu_	ps aux
2006-06-23T09:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Ackeubu_	although, you'll probably want to pipe it into less: ps aux | less
2006-06-24T13:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Ackeubu_	apt-get

2006-08-11T16:18:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	Flannel	finalbeta just said that lirc didnt work for dapper?!
2006-08-11T16:47:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	Flannel	hey again. i already had some version of lirc installed with synaptic. im trying to get it to recieve pics from my pda and my cell phone. so how do i know if lirc is working and how do i use lirc if it is working?
2006-08-11T16:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Ackeubu_	no idea, I don't have a laptop, or any sort of IR stuff ;)
2006-08-11T16:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Ackeubu_	theres a link at the bottom of the wiki page for general lirc configurations, if I remember correctly
2006-08-11T16:50:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	Flannel	I tryid to use the lirchowto but got errors on make modules. so Im screwed in that regard. lirc_dev doesnt seem to be on my system when doing a locate lirc_dev. so..I dont know where I am and where to go.. >P
2006-09-27T12:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Ackeubu_	gnome-desktop is just a meta package, it's safe to remove, but if/when you upgrade (to edgy), you'll want to reinstall it
2006-09-27T12:19:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	Flannel	i am running edgy
2006-09-27T12:19:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	Flannel	so i should keep it?
2006-09-27T12:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Ackeubu_	then, whenever you upgrade to 7.04, you'll want to reinstall ubuntu-desktop
2006-09-27T12:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Ackeubu_	after edgy is finalized, you'll want to reinstall it, incase some stuff was added at release
2006-09-27T12:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Ackeubu_	but, your system won't break because of not having it
2006-09-27T12:19:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	Flannel	i better keep it then, I never remember to reinstall it.. ;)
2006-09-27T12:27:00.000Z	Flannel	Ackeubu_	remove your old kernels via apt-get
2006-09-27T12:27:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	Flannel	okay
