2006-01-28T13:01:00.000Z	mwe	t_uk2	It's not just booting with a blank screen? I had that problem but solved it by disabling framebuffer
2006-01-28T13:02:00.000Z	mwe	t_uk2	?
2006-01-28T13:03:00.000Z	mwe	t_uk2	hmm
2006-01-28T13:03:00.000Z	mwe	t_uk2	maybe some other boot option like disabling apic. don't you even get an error? Are you sure the cd is ok?
2006-01-28T13:04:00.000Z	mwe	t_uk2	adn you don't get any errors or anything?
2006-01-28T13:05:00.000Z	mwe	t_uk2	that's all? no messages before that?
2006-01-28T13:05:00.000Z	mwe	t_uk2	what kind of computer is this?
2006-01-28T13:06:00.000Z	mwe	t_uk2	should be enough to install. I don't know
2006-01-28T13:07:00.000Z	mwe	t_uk2	weird then
2006-01-28T13:10:00.000Z	mwe	t_uk2	but he can't get the installer up
2006-01-28T13:14:00.000Z	mwe	t_uk2	what kind of internet connection?

2006-01-28T13:17:00.000Z	mwe	t_uk2	debian.org
2006-01-28T13:18:00.000Z	mwe	t_uk2	I wonder why you can't bring up the installer if you did before
