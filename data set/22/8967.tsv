2005-04-12T09:29:00.000Z	robos	osity	yes
2005-04-12T09:29:00.000Z	osity	robos	how does putty get in? what technology
2005-04-12T09:31:00.000Z	robos	osity	do you have manual access to the machine? I.e. can you check if sshd is running?
2005-04-12T09:32:00.000Z	osity	robos	good idea ...how do i check
2005-04-12T09:32:00.000Z	robos	osity	try this: /etc/init.d/sshd restart
2005-04-12T09:34:00.000Z	osity	robos	the sshd is not in there....
2005-04-12T09:34:00.000Z	robos	osity	then you need to install it :)
2005-04-12T09:34:00.000Z	robos	osity	in synaptic, search ssh
2005-04-12T09:34:00.000Z	osity	robos	i thought i did.. :
2005-04-12T09:34:00.000Z	robos	osity	oh well
2005-04-12T09:35:00.000Z	osity	robos	i thought it was apt-get install openssh-server?
2005-04-12T09:35:00.000Z	robos	osity	sounds right, but look again in synaptic if it is really installed.
2005-04-12T09:36:00.000Z	osity	robos	so whats the diff between my commnad and yours?
2005-04-12T09:37:00.000Z	robos	osity	well, ssh is a meta package for openssh-server, so that you can find it more easy
2005-04-12T09:39:00.000Z	osity	robos	it said it cant find the sshd package with your command...
2005-04-12T09:39:00.000Z	robos	osity	I didn't say to use apt-get, I said take a look in synaptic, that tells you what to use
2005-04-12T09:42:00.000Z	robos	osity	if you want to use apt, try apt-cache search ssh
2005-04-12T10:15:00.000Z	robos	osity	what nic?
2005-04-12T10:16:00.000Z	robos	osity	lspci | grep Ether
