2006-04-20T10:45:00.000Z	harisund		Has anyone here used Mathematica? I am looking for some FSF equivalent in Ubuntu, which can do *symbolic* computations (no, Octave can't)
2006-04-20T10:47:00.000Z	driggers	harisund	i've used maple 9.5 in fc3
2006-04-20T10:47:00.000Z	driggers		but i couldn't tell you how to install it to save my life
2006-04-20T10:47:00.000Z	harisund	driggers	Yes, maple is pretty good too, but you can't apt-get that right? Isn't it proprietary?
2006-04-20T10:47:00.000Z	harisund	driggers	maple is also what I use in school .. but I want to have some sort of a decent symbolic computation tool for Ubuntu
2006-04-20T10:47:00.000Z	driggers	harisund	sorry i don't even know what apt-get is
2006-04-20T10:48:00.000Z	driggers		maple is comparable (some say better) than mathematica
2006-04-20T10:48:00.000Z	harisund	driggers	ok don't bother. maple is basically not free..
2006-04-20T10:48:00.000Z	driggers		neither is mathematica
2006-04-20T10:48:00.000Z	harisund	driggers	Yep, maple and mathematica are comparable, but they are not free..
2006-04-20T10:48:00.000Z	driggers		maybe u thinking of maxima?
2006-04-20T10:48:00.000Z	harisund	driggers	maxima? what is that?
2006-04-20T10:48:00.000Z	harisund	driggers	that doesn't sound like anything I have heard before?
2006-04-20T10:49:00.000Z	driggers		maxima and mupad are both symbolic, i'm pretty sure harisund.  you can google them i guess
2006-04-20T10:49:00.000Z	driggers	harisund	one or both of them are free i think
2006-04-20T10:49:00.000Z	harisund	driggers	ah ha ! Thanks .. will check up on them.... yes, it looks like maxima is free..
2006-04-20T10:50:00.000Z	driggers		isn't it a bit odd to have a single op bot?  i mean what if ubotu crashes?
2006-04-20T10:50:00.000Z	driggers		k
2006-04-20T10:50:00.000Z	harisund	driggers	you know what, a couple of days back there was a netsplit.
2006-04-20T10:50:00.000Z	harisund	driggers	and ubotu was indeed lost :D
2006-04-20T10:51:00.000Z	driggers	harisund	no troll took controll and banned everyone?  maybe that's not possible... anyway, way off topic
2006-04-20T10:51:00.000Z	harisund	driggers	join me in ubuntu-offtopic
