2010-10-25T05:55:00.000Z	bohemien		I have trouble with updating to 10.10, after install and restart, in the login screen it won't ask for user/psw
2010-10-25T05:56:00.000Z	bohemien		hello, can someone help me?
2010-10-25T05:56:00.000Z	spinningcompass	bohemien	What does the screen say?
2010-10-25T05:57:00.000Z	bohemien	spinningcompass	nothing, only the background image and mouse
2010-10-25T05:58:00.000Z	bohemien	spinningcompass	i tried the no-fail boot but wont work either
2010-10-25T05:58:00.000Z	spinningcompass	bohemien	Try installing 10.04 instead
2010-10-25T05:58:00.000Z	spinningcompass	bohemien	....and wait until 10.10 stabilizes.
2010-10-25T06:00:00.000Z	bohemien	spinningcompass	how can I go back to 10,04%
2010-10-25T06:00:00.000Z	spinningcompass	bohemien	(There are other options, of course, but...) Download 10.04; install it; use it. When 10.10 has stabilized, upgrade.
2010-10-25T06:01:00.000Z	bohemien	spinningcompass	if I install 10.04 would I lose data?
2010-10-25T06:02:00.000Z	spinningcompass	bohemien	Not if you back it up first.
2010-10-25T06:02:00.000Z	spinningcompass	bohemien	Did you start out with 10.10 or did you upgrade?
2010-10-25T06:02:00.000Z	bohemien	spinningcompass	I upgraded from 10.04
2010-10-25T06:03:00.000Z	spinningcompass	bohemien	So, you're telling me failsafe doesn't work eitiher, yes?
2010-10-25T06:03:00.000Z	bohemien	spinningcompass	exact, in the menu I tried dpkg, but didn't seem to access internet
2010-10-25T06:03:00.000Z	spinningcompass		k
2010-10-25T06:06:00.000Z	bohemien	spinningcompass	so no easy way to fix the problem? I thought it would be easy to upgrade to 10.10, I was wrong
2010-10-25T06:07:00.000Z	bohemien	spinningcompass	I can access the console, but I'm not a linux geek
2010-10-25T06:09:00.000Z	spinningcompass	bohemien	Did you backup your data before upgrading?
2010-10-25T06:09:00.000Z	bohemien	spinningcompass	no
2010-10-25T06:09:00.000Z	bohemien	spinningcompass	but I could now I guess
2010-10-25T06:10:00.000Z	spinningcompass	bohemien	I would encourage you to backup data *before* upgrading your OS.
