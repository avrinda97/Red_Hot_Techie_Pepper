2009-02-12T12:38:00.000Z	mattycoze		does anyone know a good alternative to SPSS and or MATLAB?
2009-02-12T12:39:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	R
2009-02-12T12:39:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	also look at octave
2009-02-12T12:39:00.000Z	mattycoze	nanotube	& jtaji do any of them come with a GUI
2009-02-12T12:39:00.000Z	mattycoze	nanotube	i did try octave; but none of the gui's worked for me :(
2009-02-12T12:39:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	there's a gui for r called rkward. don't know about octave.
2009-02-12T12:39:00.000Z	mattycoze	nanotube	is rkward good in your opinion?
2009-02-12T12:40:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	i've heard that it's pretty good. never used it myself, i write my code with my keyboard, and that's the way i like it. :)
2009-02-12T12:40:00.000Z	mattycoze	nanotube	heh well i'm just starting off with advanced stats; multivariate analysis, MANOVA etc...
2009-02-12T12:41:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	if you are "in it for the long haul", learn the code. if you are in it just for a class or something and don't really care, then you can get away with a gui. :)
2009-02-12T12:43:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	the plot() command comes in handy. :)
2009-02-12T12:43:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	if you're gonna use R, there is /tons/ of documentation on r-project.org
2009-02-12T12:44:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	you can generate all kinds of fancy graphics. :)
2009-02-12T12:44:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	yes, really. :)
2009-02-12T12:57:00.000Z	mattycoze	nanotube	do you use the R Command functions?
2009-02-12T13:00:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	what do you mean ? all R commands are functions...
2009-02-12T13:02:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	d.w = ?
2009-02-12T13:02:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	heh ic. :)
2009-02-12T13:02:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	i suggest to start with reading "an introduction to R", the nice pdf available on r-project.org in the documentation section.
2009-02-12T13:03:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	that will quickly give you an idea of what's up with R and gow things work.
2009-02-12T13:05:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	well... it is what it is. :)
2009-02-12T13:06:00.000Z	nanotube	mattycoze	 you do not expect the most powerful and flexible statistical computing language in the world to be documentable in a page, do you? :)
