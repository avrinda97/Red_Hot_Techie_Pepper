2007-01-23T14:52:00.000Z	Raf	ciscosurfer	just a little thing, why aptitude and not apt-get?
2007-01-23T14:53:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	Raf	I prefer it...it handles dependencies better...just my opinion though

2007-01-23T14:55:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	Raf	I believe rapidsvn is simply a gui front-end to subversion
2007-01-23T14:56:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	Raf	that link i sent was no good, huh?
2007-01-23T14:57:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	Raf	you want to run a subversion repo don't you....not access one....i think i got confused
