2008-01-24T12:29:00.000Z	sn00zer		does anyone know what causes this error: ssh: connect to host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx port xx: connection timed out
2008-01-24T12:29:00.000Z	n2diy_	sn00zer	you aren't logging in/authenticating to it.
2008-01-24T12:30:00.000Z	sn00zer	n2diy_	it doesn't give me the chance, it used to prompt for a password, now it sits there until i get the time out message
2008-01-24T12:31:00.000Z	n2diy_	sn00zer	and you're using the same procedure now has you did in the past? Maybe it has been locked down?
2008-01-24T12:32:00.000Z	sn00zer	n2diy_	i've been trying to setup vnc over ssh but i don't think i've changed anything in the ssh settings
2008-01-24T12:33:00.000Z	n2diy_	sn00zer	do you currently have physical access to the server?
2008-01-24T12:33:00.000Z	sn00zer	n2diy_	yes
2008-01-24T12:34:00.000Z	n2diy_	sn00zer	can you ping the server, and vice versus?
2008-01-24T12:34:00.000Z	sn00zer	n2diy_	yes, successful ping in both directions
2008-01-24T12:35:00.000Z	n2diy_	sn00zer	hmmm, weird, no other error messages?
2008-01-24T12:36:00.000Z	sn00zer	n2diy_	not that i can tell, both pc's are right in front of me, on the client i enter ssh -X user@host and the cursor moves down 1 line and blinks until the time out error is shown
2008-01-24T12:37:00.000Z	sn00zer	n2diy_	and i've shut down and restarted the sshd several times but that didn't help
2008-01-24T12:37:00.000Z	n2diy_	sn00zer	I thought the command was ssh -l usernam blah blah blah?
2008-01-24T12:39:00.000Z	sn00zer	n2diy_	i don't think you need the -l if you use username@host, -l is for ssh username "space" host
2008-01-24T12:40:00.000Z	n2diy_	sn00zer	Could be? How about machine name. -l username. Maybe the DNS has changed?
2008-01-24T12:41:00.000Z	sn00zer	n2diy_	didn't help
2008-01-24T12:44:00.000Z	sn00zer	n2diy_	thanks for your help, i'll try a full reboot tomorrow and see if it fixes it
2008-01-24T12:44:00.000Z	n2diy_	sn00zer	ok, good luck, 73
2008-01-24T12:45:00.000Z	sn00zer	n2diy_	73?
2008-01-24T12:45:00.000Z	n2diy_	sn00zer	google 73 and ham radio. :)
2008-01-24T12:46:00.000Z	sn00zer	n2diy_	ahh, anyway, thanks again
2008-01-24T12:46:00.000Z	n2diy_	sn00zer	73
