2009-10-24T01:26:00.000Z	eaxexee	Lenny1729	I actually don't know, sorry :/
2009-10-24T01:13:00.000Z	eaxexee	Lenny1729	is it a wireless broadband or regular wireless card?
2009-10-24T01:13:00.000Z	Lenny1729	eaxexee	regular w-lan card, in my case a broadcom card
2009-10-24T01:14:00.000Z	eaxexee	Lenny1729	and it's not supported? Have you tried going to System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers ?
2009-10-24T01:15:00.000Z	Lenny1729	eaxexee	Normally I would connect to ethernet and run the propriertary driver application to download it, than it works fine. But I no longer have ethernet connection, so the typical hen egg problem
2009-10-24T01:15:00.000Z	eaxexee	Lenny1729	Ohh snap! I know the feeling :/ Have you tried ndiswrapper?
2009-10-24T01:16:00.000Z	Lenny1729	eaxexee	No not yet, how would it work?
2009-10-24T01:17:00.000Z	Lenny1729	eaxexee	is there no way to download the right broadcom driver before my reinstallation and then install the driver from USB on my new Ubuntu 9.10 system?
2009-10-24T01:17:00.000Z	eaxexee	Lenny1729	Wait, you don't have internet in 9.10?
2009-10-24T01:20:00.000Z	Lenny1729	eaxexee	Yes, exactly, right now I'm running 9.04 with the right propiertary driver for my broadcom w-lan card installed via the "hardware-driver" tool. But in the place I moved to I no longer can connect to ethernet, so w-lan is the only option to connect to the internet, that's why I figured I gonna have a problem after I'll have installed Ubuntu 9.10 on my PC, because then I won't be able to run the "Hardware-driver" tool to download the right driv
2009-10-24T01:20:00.000Z	eaxexee	Lenny1729	How do you update it?
2009-10-24T01:21:00.000Z	Lenny1729	eaxexee	I'm gonna download the image and do a fresh installation of Ubuntu 9.10 to get ext4
2009-10-24T01:21:00.000Z	eaxexee	Lenny1729	Why not use the builtin?
2009-10-24T01:21:00.000Z	Lenny1729	eaxexee	the builtin driver? on ubuntu 9.04 the build in driver didn't work... does it work with 9.10?
2009-10-24T01:22:00.000Z	eaxexee	Lenny1729	I haven't had ANY problems at all :) But you can update from within Ubuntu, and they added a LOT of drivers in 1729
2009-10-24T01:23:00.000Z	Lenny1729	eaxexee	but an update from 9.04 to 9.10 won't bring a real ext4 on my drive I read somewhere
2009-10-24T01:24:00.000Z	eaxexee	Lenny1729	Ohh okay, hmm, well you could download ndiswrapper, the "real" driver, and whatever would be needed to install it and then install it when you are in your new system :)
2009-10-24T01:25:00.000Z	Lenny1729	eaxexee	Okay, okay and then after that run the "hardware driver" tool, right?
2009-10-24T01:26:00.000Z	eaxexee	Lenny1729	Well, Ndiswrapper is a tool designed to user Propetary (Can't remember how to spell it sorry) drivers in Linux so I don't think you would need it afterwards
2009-10-24T01:26:00.000Z	Lenny1729	eaxexee	is there no way to download the file, that "hardware drivers" tool would download manually it provide it via a USB stick to the system
2009-10-24T01:27:00.000Z	Lenny1729	eaxexee	okay, but thanks for your help anyway! It's always great to see how friendly users are in this chat
2009-10-24T01:27:00.000Z	eaxexee	Lenny1729	You are more than welcome :)
