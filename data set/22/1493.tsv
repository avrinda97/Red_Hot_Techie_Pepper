2010-09-22T11:45:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets		Hey guys. My laptop's wireless won't connect to my wireless network, but it shows it. My drivers are installed. Advice?
2010-09-22T11:47:00.000Z	sweetpi	MasterofPuppets	double check mac filtering on your router, and encryption type and key
2010-09-22T11:47:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	sweetpi	I did, everything is the same
2010-09-22T11:47:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	sweetpi	I was connected about 7 hours ago, shut off my laptop before going to work, came back and it's not connecting
2010-09-22T11:49:00.000Z	sweetpi	MasterofPuppets	I was going to suggest checking the "wireless off" button on your laptop, but you said you can see the access point?
2010-09-22T11:49:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	sweetpi	Yes, it's just that I start connecting and then the connection drops
2010-09-22T11:50:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	sweetpi	I know that the adapter is fine because aircrack-ng is showing activity in terminal, the connection just won't stay up
2010-09-22T11:50:00.000Z	sweetpi	MasterofPuppets	what about signal strength?
2010-09-22T11:52:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	sweetpi	fluctuating at about -30 power, so basically full strength
2010-09-22T11:55:00.000Z	sweetpi	MasterofPuppets	check dmesg
2010-09-22T11:56:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	sweetpi	It associates and then deauthenticates itself
2010-09-22T11:59:00.000Z	sweetpi	MasterofPuppets	Ive had that problem with a faulty antenna or maybe it was a driver problem. I had to use a static ip and try 3-4 times before it would stop acting like that
2010-09-22T11:59:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	sweetpi	Everything is unchanged, though. The driver shouldn't stop working and the antenna is fine
2010-09-22T12:00:00.000Z	sweetpi	MasterofPuppets	yeah I agree. maybe reboot the access point or check for mac conflicts?
2010-09-22T12:05:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	sweetpi	I ran dhclient wlan0 and I can ping the router
2010-09-22T12:05:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	sweetpi	so it's definitely something in the GUI
2010-09-22T12:07:00.000Z	sweetpi	MasterofPuppets	network-manager is one of the first things i kill, I use wpa_supplicant. maybe try deleting your entry for your AP in n-m and add it again
2010-09-22T12:12:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	sweetpi	I think you're going to love this, by the way, but I just fixed it by turning the wireless on the laptop on and off.
2010-09-22T12:13:00.000Z	sweetpi	MasterofPuppets	hehe nice
2010-09-22T12:13:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	sweetpi	It's disgusting, I should have thought of that first. Well, thanks haha
2010-09-22T12:14:00.000Z	sweetpi	MasterofPuppets	I imagine the laptop went to sleep while you were at work?
2010-09-22T12:15:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	sweetpi	I guess so, and lucid must not agree with turning the adapter back on when it wakes up
