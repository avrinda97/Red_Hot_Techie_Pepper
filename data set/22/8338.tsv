2005-10-17T08:00:00.000Z	ishtvan22	transparentdream	you need graphic acceleration
2005-10-17T08:01:00.000Z	transparentdream	ishtvan22	And what am i missing that i dont have it already>
2005-10-17T08:01:00.000Z	ishtvan22	transparentdream	there is not very good support for ATI stuff
2005-10-17T08:01:00.000Z	transparentdream	ishtvan22	bah       should i just try to run my regular onboard card then?
2005-10-17T08:01:00.000Z	ishtvan22	transparentdream	look in the howto in the ubuntu forums for ATI graphic acceleration
2005-10-17T08:02:00.000Z	transparentdream	ishtvan22	ok...thanks
