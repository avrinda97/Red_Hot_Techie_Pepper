2009-05-25T20:40:00.000Z	Nash		I can't select any option in compiz, though I have effects set on normal... How can I get this to work again ? :\
2009-05-25T20:41:00.000Z	Zzeiss	Nash	is your video card online?
2009-05-25T20:41:00.000Z	Nash	Zzeiss	I geuss ? how do you mean online
2009-05-25T20:42:00.000Z	Zzeiss	Nash	as in, when you run "glxgears" - what's the frame rate?  Run it from a terminal, it will tell you.
2009-05-25T20:43:00.000Z	Nash	Zzeiss	When should I stop glxgears ?
2009-05-25T20:44:00.000Z	Zzeiss	Nash	after it prints out a "frames per second" on the terminal.... and then tell us what that number is.
2009-05-25T20:44:00.000Z	Nash	Zzeiss	Highest one is 433.542, it did multiple cause I left it running
2009-05-25T20:45:00.000Z	Zzeiss	Nash	kill them all, then run ONE by itself.
2009-05-25T20:45:00.000Z	Nash	Zzeiss	i just typed glxgears and every 5 seconds it gave me an output
2009-05-25T20:46:00.000Z	Zzeiss	Nash	OK.  So- the number is less than 1000, which means you are not using a graphics card and thus your card is not "online" (graphics cards do from 2000 to LOTS MORE.  And that's why compiz won't work- it needs some callins to the graphichs card hardware.
2009-05-25T20:47:00.000Z	Nash	Zzeiss	Compiz has worked before I think, but how do I get my card online ?
2009-05-25T20:48:00.000Z	Nash	Zzeiss	Also you should know its not the best graphics card
2009-05-25T20:48:00.000Z	Nash	Zzeiss	Some animations are working though
2009-05-25T20:48:00.000Z	Zzeiss	Nash	Well, somehow, you disabled the driver for your card.  Maybe an uninstall/reinstall.  (it doesn't take much for Compiz.  I know the Intel chipset works fine).
2009-05-25T20:50:00.000Z	Nash	Zzeiss	Actually I think the drivers arent yet installed
2009-05-25T20:50:00.000Z	Zzeiss	Nash	OK, try installing the drivers.  :)
2009-05-25T20:50:00.000Z	Nash	Zzeiss	Where can I find graphic card information and current driver information ?
2009-05-25T20:51:00.000Z	Zzeiss	Nash	Depends on the card.  But- Google is your friend! :)
2009-05-25T20:53:00.000Z	Nash	Zzeiss	Erm, sorry to bother you again But I found out I have an ATI radeon xpress200 but the site of ATI driver download only goes too express 300
2009-05-25T20:54:00.000Z	Zzeiss	Nash	Well, try the flglx (spelling?) Ubuntu driver then.

2009-05-25T21:08:00.000Z	Nash	Zzeiss	I still find it strange, cause I used the options on compiz just yesterday
