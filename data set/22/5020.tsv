2007-10-22T18:29:00.000Z	abbe		hi channel
2007-10-22T18:30:00.000Z	abbe		I've just install Gobuntu (amd64) 7.10 on a intel D945GNT box
2007-10-22T18:30:00.000Z	abbe		during the bootup, I'm not getting any display
2007-10-22T18:30:00.000Z	abbe		I mean the monitor shows out-of-frequency
2007-10-22T18:30:00.000Z	Slart	abbe	have you disabled the splash screen?
2007-10-22T18:31:00.000Z	abbe	Slart	nop, after gdm is loaded, everything works fine
2007-10-22T18:31:00.000Z	Slart	abbe	I can't see the pretty ubuntu logo on bootup neither.. come to think of it, I haven't checked since upgrading to gutsy but that was a problem under feisty
2007-10-22T18:32:00.000Z	Slart	abbe	you can change this in grub's menu.lst file...
2007-10-22T18:32:00.000Z	abbe	Slart	yes it also happened on feisty on one box.
2007-10-22T18:32:00.000Z	abbe	Slart	how ?
2007-10-22T18:32:00.000Z	Slart	abbe	brb
2007-10-22T18:32:00.000Z	abbe	Slart	np
2007-10-22T19:01:00.000Z	Slart	abbe	ok, back.. did you get that splash screen thingy sorted out?
2007-10-22T19:02:00.000Z	abbe	Slart	nop, you're to tell me what should switch shall I need to pass.
2007-10-22T19:02:00.000Z	abbe	Slart	s/'re/'ve/
2007-10-22T19:04:00.000Z	Slart	abbe	ok.. type this in a terminal, "gksu gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst" . It will open a file in a text editor.. this is the file we'll be changing
2007-10-22T19:04:00.000Z	Slart	abbe	search for a line that starts with "# defoptions=".. it's about halfway into the file
2007-10-22T19:04:00.000Z	abbe	Slart	what parameter should I pass to kernel
2007-10-22T19:05:00.000Z	Slart	abbe	nosplash
2007-10-22T19:05:00.000Z	abbe	Slart	okay, thanks. I'll try and report it tomorrow
2007-10-22T19:05:00.000Z	Slart	abbe	that will give you a text-only boot output instead of the logo
2007-10-22T19:05:00.000Z	abbe	Slart	if I'd any issues with that.
