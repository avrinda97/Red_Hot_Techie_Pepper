2007-10-21T09:25:00.000Z	Jban		How do you get a DVD to stop trying to play in Ubuntu, MPLayer is non-responsive.
2007-10-21T09:25:00.000Z	nickrud	Jban	alt-f2 xkill , click the mplayer window
2007-10-21T09:26:00.000Z	Jban	nickrud	What's xkill ?
2007-10-21T09:26:00.000Z	nickrud	Jban	its an app that forces an X window app to die
2007-10-21T09:27:00.000Z	Jban	nickrud	When I clikc alt+f2 it brings up a window about running it?
2007-10-21T09:27:00.000Z	nickrud	Jban	type xkill in that window, it's like the run window in windows
2007-10-21T09:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Jban	I tend to use that rather than the menu, it's faster :)
2007-10-21T09:28:00.000Z	Jban	nickrud	MPlayer wont close
2007-10-21T09:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Jban	then in a terminal, type killall -9 mplayer    or   gmplayer
2007-10-21T09:29:00.000Z	nickrud	Jban	that's the biggest hammer available
2007-10-21T09:29:00.000Z	Jban	nickrud	That worked
2007-10-21T09:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Jban	iobelisk the technique is the same, chrooting to the ubuntu install and editing the grub file
2007-10-21T09:31:00.000Z	nickrud	Jban	kill -15 (same as xkill) tells a process to exit normally, -9 kills it unconditionally. -9 is for last resort
2007-10-21T09:33:00.000Z	Jban	nickrud	Hey Nick, would you mind answering a few questions that I have about why what I did just worked, and why what I tried before that did not in regards to DVD playing?
2007-10-21T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud	Jban	sure
2007-10-21T09:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Jban	just be prepared for the 'duh, I dunno's :)
2007-10-21T09:35:00.000Z	Jban	nickrud	Ok, after a lengthy process of installing random codes and all sorts of mess that I had no idea, and anyway, this finally allowed me to successfully attempt playing The Descent off of VLC Player.  Now, when I first started it up, I did the run disc selecting the "DVD" option, which made it play for the first 10 seconds then froze and closed... the second time, I selected "DVD Menues" and it started and contin
2007-10-21T09:36:00.000Z	nickrud	Jban	I'm not an expert on this, but simply installing vlc and libdvdcss2 from medibuntu made my dvd playing painless
2007-10-21T09:37:00.000Z	Jban	nickrud	Yeah I got it to play now, I was just asking a knowledge question.
2007-10-21T09:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Jban	I dunno ;)
2007-10-21T09:38:00.000Z	Jban	nickrud	It was like me skipping the menus, caused the DVD to not run correctly... since I guess a DVD with menues is a retial DVD, and a DVD without menues is like a a different kind?
2007-10-21T09:38:00.000Z	nickrud	Jban	ibid ;)
