2006-07-19T13:51:00.000Z	Pandora82		*sighs* sometimes I think it would be better to go back to windows
2006-07-19T13:52:00.000Z	Pandora82		more or less reset the OS
2006-07-19T13:52:00.000Z	mwe	Pandora82	reset? you mean reinstall?
2006-07-19T13:53:00.000Z	Pandora82	mwe	not really - a reset or something to get back to standard without loosing personal data
2006-07-19T13:54:00.000Z	mwe	Pandora82	you can't just "reset" the system
2006-07-19T13:54:00.000Z	mwe	Pandora82	what is the problem?
2006-07-19T13:54:00.000Z	mwe	Pandora82	what makes you think a "reset" which is not really possible would fix that?
2006-07-19T13:55:00.000Z	Pandora82	mwe	3 or more people could fix it
2006-07-19T13:55:00.000Z	mwe	Pandora82	huh?
2006-07-19T13:56:00.000Z	mwe	Pandora82	I don't think a resinstall or "reset" would fix it though
2006-07-19T13:56:00.000Z	Pandora82	mwe	I already know this...
2006-07-19T13:56:00.000Z	mwe	Pandora82	read /msg from ubotu if you didn't
2006-07-19T13:57:00.000Z	mwe	Pandora82	ok
2006-07-19T13:58:00.000Z	mwe	Pandora82	I don't know what's wrong but I doubt a reinstall fixes it unless you really messed something up that broke it.
2006-07-19T13:59:00.000Z	Pandora82	mwe	I don't know if I messed up something. possible
2006-07-19T13:59:00.000Z	mwe	Pandora82	then didn't
2006-07-19T13:59:00.000Z	mwe	Pandora82	you know if you mess around usually
2006-07-19T14:01:00.000Z	Pandora82	mwe	it ist possible that I messed around. I once was able to burn CDs and later I was not anymore... I tried to fix it... maybe I messed up something then
2006-07-19T14:01:00.000Z	mwe	Pandora82	go ahead though I'm not a fan of the "reinstall fix"
2006-07-19T14:01:00.000Z	Pandora82	mwe	I can't reinstall... I can't backup my data
2006-07-19T14:06:00.000Z	mwe	Pandora82	just rename /home then boot a live cd and remove the rest then reinstall without formatting
2006-07-19T14:06:00.000Z	mwe	Pandora82	actually rename /home from the live cd as well
