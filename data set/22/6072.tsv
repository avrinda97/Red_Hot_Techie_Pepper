2007-01-16T11:04:00.000Z	mister_roboto	theflyingfool	i'd suggest the usual first step of checking the logs (/var/log/messages)
2007-01-16T11:05:00.000Z	theflyingfool	mister_roboto	im not finding anything in there
2007-01-16T11:07:00.000Z	mister_roboto	theflyingfool	do you have an Sxx script for it in /etc/rc2?
2007-01-16T11:08:00.000Z	theflyingfool	mister_roboto	is rc2.d close enough?
2007-01-16T11:09:00.000Z	mister_roboto	theflyingfool	lol   yep, that's what i meant
2007-01-16T11:09:00.000Z	theflyingfool	mister_roboto	i dont htink i see one how do i make it anew
2007-01-16T11:11:00.000Z	mister_roboto	theflyingfool	i don't run gnome so i'm just assuming it would get started with an init script. for making one from scratch, you can copy an existing one to a new number and modify to start the right program (later numbers start later in the init process).   and don't forget the corresponding Kxx (kill) script in rc1.d
2007-01-16T11:12:00.000Z	theflyingfool	mister_roboto	 its stuff like this that makes me wish i didnt destroy my windows cd
2007-01-16T11:12:00.000Z	mister_roboto	theflyingfool	i don't understand. what made it stop starting? doesn't that start with the gnome desktop automatically? did it ever work?
2007-01-16T11:13:00.000Z	mister_roboto	theflyingfool	again... i don't run gnome here so a little cluelessa bout it
2007-01-16T11:13:00.000Z	theflyingfool	mister_roboto	it worked until i did a asys update

2007-01-16T11:15:00.000Z	theflyingfool	mister_roboto	 are you using KDE?
2007-01-16T11:15:00.000Z	mister_roboto	theflyingfool	yes
2007-01-16T11:17:00.000Z	mister_roboto	theflyingfool	outta curiosity, i googled "gnome-settings daemon not starting" and got a bunch of hits
2007-01-16T11:17:00.000Z	mister_roboto	theflyingfool	you might try looking around in there first
2007-01-16T11:18:00.000Z	theflyingfool	mister_roboto	this is the first problem i had that i forgout about google
