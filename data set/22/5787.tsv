2007-04-08T06:19:00.000Z	Rei-chan		Broadcom, is this a mac?
2007-04-08T06:20:00.000Z	Rei-chan		Ok, as asked, what model broadcom?
2007-04-08T06:21:00.000Z	Rei-chan		Debian guys don't hate us. :)
2007-04-08T06:21:00.000Z	Rei-chan		Its just bad form to ask them stuff about Ubuntu.
2007-04-08T06:21:00.000Z	Xenguy	Rei-chan	why would we?
2007-04-08T06:22:00.000Z	Rei-chan		xenguy: Why would you ask #Debian? Someone tried. :) It did not work as well as it should of.
2007-04-08T06:23:00.000Z	Xenguy	Rei-chan	Not sure what you mean; I was responding to this:   20:22 < Rei-chan> Debian guys don't hate us. :)
2007-04-08T06:23:00.000Z	Rei-chan	Xenguy	Oh, ok. :) Someone asked for help in #Debian with apt-get. He was run out on a rail.
2007-04-08T06:23:00.000Z	Xenguy	Rei-chan	hrm, really
2007-04-08T06:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	Rei-chan	tough crowd ;-)
2007-04-08T06:24:00.000Z	Rei-chan		xenguy: Basic concept: apt-get for ubuntu is dist specific, GTFO, STFU, go away.
2007-04-08T06:24:00.000Z	Rei-chan		Is there a reason, btw, that Ubuntu Edy has xorg setup for a wiacom?
2007-04-08T06:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	Rei-chan	oh, that's different; if you ask for ubuntu help there, they *will* stab you
2007-04-08T06:25:00.000Z	Rei-chan		xenguy: Yes, there was some stabbing.
2007-04-08T06:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	Rei-chan	heh, predictable
2007-04-08T06:25:00.000Z	Rei-chan		xenguy: And talk of invasion. It was funny. Not so much for ubuntuuser9090, though.
2007-04-08T06:26:00.000Z	Xenguy	Rei-chan	it's just a boundary line that has been drawn; people just need to respect it :-)
2007-04-08T06:26:00.000Z	Rei-chan		xenguy: Does the bot have something to say about that? I like our bot.
2007-04-08T06:26:00.000Z	Xenguy	Rei-chan	no clue
2007-04-08T06:26:00.000Z	Rei-chan		xenguy: It should. It should warn people. Like how it warns about automatix.
2007-04-08T06:27:00.000Z	Rei-chan		hazuka: Correct.
2007-04-08T06:27:00.000Z	Xenguy	Rei-chan	I'm not sure a warning is necessary re: respect the rules of a #channel  :-)
