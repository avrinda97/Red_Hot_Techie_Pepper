2005-12-14T07:13:00.000Z	_SvaMpen_		can any1 explain what X is?
2005-12-14T07:13:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SvaMpen_	X Windows is the GUI implementation on Linux
2005-12-14T07:13:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SvaMpen_	or at least, the dominant one
2005-12-14T07:14:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SvaMpen_	you have different methods of implementing the protocol (different X Servers, like xvesa and X.Org)
2005-12-14T07:14:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SvaMpen_	it's a Window Manager
2005-12-14T07:14:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SvaMpen_	X itself is simply the video modes and the underlying framework
2005-12-14T07:17:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SvaMpen_	WMs do not interfere with X
2005-12-14T07:20:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SvaMpen_	quite a few
2005-12-14T07:20:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SvaMpen_	but, at that point, you lose features most users are loathe to use
2005-12-14T07:21:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SvaMpen_	my own WM has a filesize smaller than 1 MB
2005-12-14T07:21:00.000Z	_SvaMpen_	Razor-X	can u watch movies?
2005-12-14T07:21:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SvaMpen_	of course, I can read manga, watch movies/anime, and browse the net graphically
2005-12-14T07:22:00.000Z	Razor-X	_SvaMpen_	pretty straightforward
