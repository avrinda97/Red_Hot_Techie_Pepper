2010-07-07T04:41:00.000Z	newboon2age	king11	really people mistakenly use the word 'virus' when they really mean malware.  While few to no viruses are currently active/a problem on Linux, there are malware exploits that  probably need to broaden your scope beyond 'viruses'
2010-07-07T04:42:00.000Z	king11	newboon2age	okay so if i get one of these malware exploits on my ubuntu is there a way i can get rid of them
2010-07-07T04:48:00.000Z	newboon2age	king11	as calum and porksoda are refering to there are programs to check for rootkits available.  i'm not sure how you guard agains javascript/browser exploits except using the javascript guard addons for firefox or whichever browser you use.
2010-07-07T04:49:00.000Z	king11	newboon2age	okay thanks for the information
2010-07-07T04:50:00.000Z	newboon2age	king11	the thing is that linux makes it hard on malware *unless you install it yourself* .  That's about the only way to get really clobbered.
2010-07-07T04:51:00.000Z	newboon2age	king11	so a malware writer needs to get you to install it if they really want to affect Linux
2010-07-07T04:51:00.000Z	newboon2age	king11	but when you are using trusted repositories that is highly unlikely.
2010-07-07T04:53:00.000Z	king11	newboon2age	well that is good because i use repositories for everything i want to install on my ubuntu computer or i manually do it through terminal
2010-07-07T04:55:00.000Z	newboon2age	king11	so really the main times we are vulnerable is when we download something manually off of another web site.  if someone really was trying to get us they'd have to replace a file in a repository or something like that.  The chances are not high.
2010-07-07T04:58:00.000Z	newboon2age	king11	Its still good for us to start thinking about security and learning how to guard.  Using your built-in firewall ufw (uncomplicated fire wall) for example.  There's a gui for it, i think its called firestarter or something
2010-07-07T04:58:00.000Z	king11	newboon2age	do you think if linux was more main stream, as in as used by the world like windows and not defined to a select community of users like us, that hackers would make malware exploits and other things to attack ubuntu or linux repositories
2010-07-07T04:59:00.000Z	newboon2age	king11	if people log onto you machine they can do damage that way.  yes, calum reminds me its called gufw.
2010-07-07T04:59:00.000Z	newboon2age	king11	yes I think so.  But in a way that will be a good problem to have because it will mean we are succeeding.
2010-07-07T05:00:00.000Z	newboon2age	king11	even at worst we will still be in WAAYYYY better position than
2010-07-07T05:01:00.000Z	king11	newboon2age	yeah but i believe in a couple of years linux will over take windows and mac os world wide as in everthing you start to see that people use is becoming more linux running in the back ground, like cell phones and tablet computers
2010-07-07T05:01:00.000Z	newboon2age	king11	windoze.  because the way Linux is designed is much more secure to begin w/  but if someone guesses your root password you can still be in trouble, so its something to bear in mind.
2010-07-07T05:02:00.000Z	king11	newboon2age	well the good thing is that most people that see me run linux don't understand it and only notice the eye candy like the stuff you do with compiz for more productivity on your computer
2010-07-07T05:03:00.000Z	king11	newboon2age	lol, no not like that i am more interested ubuntu as ubuntu changed my life and i love it for that
2010-07-07T05:04:00.000Z	newboon2age	king11	mine too.  But we are going too off topic for the ubuntu support channel.  For future meandering conversations see #ubuntu-offtopic
2010-07-07T05:05:00.000Z	king11	newboon2age	okay, well thanks again for the information on ubuntu and security
2010-07-07T05:06:00.000Z	newboon2age	king11	sure, no prob.  I'm still a newbie, so others can fill you in with more detail.  Also see forums.ubuntu.com
2010-07-07T05:07:00.000Z	king11	newboon2age	yeah i learned a lot off of ubuntu forums, especially when i first was installing ubuntu on an external hard drive
