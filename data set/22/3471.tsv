2008-08-24T12:04:00.000Z	pomada		anybody using vmware fusion?
2008-08-24T12:06:00.000Z	pomada		need to use vmware fusion
2008-08-24T12:07:00.000Z	djhash	pomada	i have used it once.. whats the problem?
2008-08-24T12:08:00.000Z	pomada	djhash	did your audio works out of the box? using fusion?
2008-08-24T12:08:00.000Z	djhash	pomada	yeah.. didn't have any issues..
2008-08-24T12:09:00.000Z	djhash	pomada	try using a USB audio...
2008-08-24T12:10:00.000Z	pomada	djhash	nah i want my card to work
2008-08-24T12:10:00.000Z	pomada	djhash	it have to
2008-08-24T12:11:00.000Z	djhash	pomada	yeah.. it should..  see if you can detect the audio card in xubuntu.. or from the liveCD..
2008-08-24T12:12:00.000Z	pomada	djhash	its not working, i already install xubuntu.. im not sure if i need to install the vmware tools, which is another pain that i need to do it manually
2008-08-24T12:12:00.000Z	pomada	djhash	i will install the vmware tools first to see what happen..
2008-08-24T12:15:00.000Z	djhash	pomada	try that.. also.. unfortunately.. the problem can be either due to fusion or the mac or the ubuntu installation.. first try to see if ubuntu detects an audio card.. then see if its the correct one.. then check if fusion is giving any errors in the logs (you can get to it using system profiler, or runing console from utilities folder)..
2008-08-24T12:16:00.000Z	pomada	djhash	 mean to boot from a ubuntu disk and check if audio is working?
2008-08-24T12:18:00.000Z	djhash	pomada	yeah..
2008-08-24T12:18:00.000Z	djhash	pomada	or you can "lshw" and see if the audio card comes up in the list.
2008-08-24T12:24:00.000Z	pomada	djhash	im in, so you say.. lshw isnt
2008-08-24T12:24:00.000Z	djhash	pomada	yeah.. "lshw"
2008-08-24T12:28:00.000Z	pomada	djhash	i think its there.. multimedia audio controller, product: ES1371 (AUDIOPCI-97)
2008-08-24T12:28:00.000Z	djhash	pomada	that sounds about right..
2008-08-24T12:29:00.000Z	pomada	djhash	yeah and actually i select that as a device.. ensoniq audiopci..
2008-08-24T12:29:00.000Z	pomada	djhash	i wonder which wannabe master i need to select
2008-08-24T12:32:00.000Z	djhash	pomada	honestly.. i'm not sure what the next steps are.. but one thing you can try to do is check if the driver is working the way it should be.. (not sure how).. if it is.. then the problem might be in vmfusion and not ubuntu..
