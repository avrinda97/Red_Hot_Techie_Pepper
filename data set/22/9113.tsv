2005-03-01T16:35:00.000Z	carajean		Hey I still have no sound either it seems to be a commen theme in ubuntu!!!!
2005-03-01T16:36:00.000Z	balor	carajean	Can I say "me too"...what soundcard do you have
2005-03-01T16:37:00.000Z	balor	carajean	intel i810?
2005-03-01T16:38:00.000Z	balor	carajean	I thought ac97 was a sound spec that was implemented on cards...my bad
2005-03-01T16:39:00.000Z	balor	carajean	It's easy to get sound working but I think ubuntu have some problems with the current Hoary kenrel
2005-03-01T16:43:00.000Z	balor	carajean	What does "alsamixer" do?
2005-03-01T16:43:00.000Z	balor	carajean	It's a command line program..open a terminal and type it
2005-03-01T16:44:00.000Z	balor	carajean	do the amixer stuff that I suggested to jacquesmerde earlier
2005-03-01T16:48:00.000Z	carajean	balor	its not there i must have logged in after that
2005-03-01T16:48:00.000Z	balor	carajean	you need to "amixer set Master 100 on" and "amixer set PCM 100 on" to unmute it
2005-03-01T16:49:00.000Z	balor	carajean	can you play sound now?
2005-03-01T16:49:00.000Z	balor	carajean	strange
2005-03-01T16:52:00.000Z	carajean	balor	any suggestions on how to fix??
2005-03-01T16:55:00.000Z	balor	carajean	Are you in the audio group?
2005-03-01T16:56:00.000Z	balor	carajean	give me a minute to test it first
2005-03-01T16:58:00.000Z	balor	carajean	type "groups" in a terminal to see if your're in the audio group
2005-03-02T17:00:00.000Z	balor	carajean	I think there may be a bug in the current Hoary kernel...I'm in the same state as you.  Hopefully it'll be fixed soon.
