2010-10-16T08:50:00.000Z	MindVirus1	Saik	What do you mean "purge"?
2010-10-16T08:51:00.000Z	Saik	MindVirus1	remove ALL data fm FF on thispc
2010-10-16T08:51:00.000Z	MindVirus1	Saik	apt-get remove --purge && rm -r /home/*/.mozilla.
2010-10-16T08:52:00.000Z	Saik	MindVirus1	thanks. try #2 lol
2010-10-16T08:59:00.000Z	MindVirus1	Saik	That should have nothing to do with his ability to use sudo.
2010-10-16T09:03:00.000Z	MindVirus1	Saik	So removing .mozilla didn't fix it?
2010-10-16T09:04:00.000Z	Saik	MindVirus1	nope..
2010-10-16T09:04:00.000Z	MindVirus1	Saik	I bet it did; I think you just had a hidden Firefox process open and not anymore.
2010-10-16T09:04:00.000Z	Saik	MindVirus1	on another issue, any idea where the addresses it stores to the address bar are stored at?
2010-10-16T09:04:00.000Z	MindVirus1	Saik	No idea.
2010-10-16T09:04:00.000Z	MindVirus1	Saik	Definitely in .mozilla though.
2010-10-16T09:05:00.000Z	Saik	MindVirus1	that's not likely. and I clearedthat folder, it still has some showing up..
2010-10-16T09:08:00.000Z	MindVirus1	Saik	Try killall -s9 firefox-bin and run that rm -r again.
2010-10-16T09:10:00.000Z	Saik	MindVirus1	now if this dumb menu would g away... lol
2010-10-16T09:11:00.000Z	MindVirus1	Saik	Alt+F2.
2010-10-16T09:12:00.000Z	Saik	MindVirus1	would you believe it did nothing at all?
2010-10-16T09:13:00.000Z	MindVirus1	Saik	Killing gnome-panel?
2010-10-16T09:13:00.000Z	MindVirus1	Saik	Wait, what?
2010-10-16T09:14:00.000Z	Saik	MindVirus1	hm..hitting log out cleared it, and I just canceled it lol
2010-10-16T09:15:00.000Z	Saik	MindVirus1	I think it's official, my mother's pc just doesn't like me
