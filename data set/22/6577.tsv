2006-09-27T05:17:00.000Z	azza_008		isnt home on root
2006-09-27T05:17:00.000Z	scrp	azza_008	yup it is
2006-09-27T05:18:00.000Z	scrp	azza_008	if you install 44gb for / then that will cover /home (for the users) and /root (homedir for root)
2006-09-27T05:19:00.000Z	scrp	azza_008	still if you want to make it simple just make a swap partition and / partition :p
2006-09-27T05:21:00.000Z	scrp	azza_008	more than enough
2006-09-27T05:22:00.000Z	scrp	azza_008	depends on your budget .)
2006-09-27T05:23:00.000Z	scrp	azza_008	however, if you are going to buy a new PC i recommend waiting 1 month or so for the new quattro CPU
2006-09-27T05:23:00.000Z	scrp	azza_008	that quattro cpu is going to rock.
2006-09-27T05:25:00.000Z	scrp	azza_008	not sure
2006-09-27T05:26:00.000Z	scrp	azza_008	well you said a new computer
2006-09-27T05:44:00.000Z	scrp	azza_008	ubuntu will check for updates for you
2006-09-27T05:45:00.000Z	scrp	azza_008	you can also go to System > Administration > update manager
2006-09-27T05:45:00.000Z	scrp	azza_008	i dont know what's lagging :)
