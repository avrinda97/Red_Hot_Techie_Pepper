2011-02-04T07:25:00.000Z	leftist		i have a serious problem with apt-get deamon
2011-02-04T07:26:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	Of course you do.
2011-02-04T07:27:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	"And the error you're getting is...
2011-02-04T07:30:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq fax2850lpr
2011-02-04T07:31:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	I'm rather convinced that'll work. :-)
2011-02-04T07:32:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	Where did you get that package from?
2011-02-04T07:33:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	I'd ask them. :-)
2011-02-04T07:34:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	It's upset that ldpd isn't installed.  dpkg -l |grep fax2850
2011-02-04T07:36:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	Let's get meaner.
2011-02-04T07:36:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	sudo dpkg --force-all -r fax2850lpr
2011-02-04T07:37:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	Welp, time to restore from backup. :-)
2011-02-04T07:38:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	Nah.  Professionals keep backups. :-D
2011-02-04T07:38:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	So, you can't install any new packages, right?
2011-02-04T07:39:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	The box is UP though.  So take a backup now, reinstall the OS.  If you did things intelligently you won't even have to touch /home
2011-02-04T07:39:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	Sure, of the kernel. :-)
2011-02-04T07:40:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	dpkg -l is a list of what's installed.  I'd surely remove the troubled packages.
2011-02-04T07:49:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	Is this system "sensitive?"
2011-02-04T07:49:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	And why are you concerned with aptdaemon anyway?
2011-02-04T07:50:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	Okay, so having someone else log in to fix it is likely not high on your to do list.
2011-02-04T07:51:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	Stupid question, but dpkg purge $packagename didn't work?
2011-02-04T07:52:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	Even when passed a force-all?
2011-02-04T07:56:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	leftist	Not really, aptdaemon just runs resident.  the concern is with the package manager itself.
