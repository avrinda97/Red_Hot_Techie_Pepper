2007-07-15T07:39:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick		What command tells me my computers ip?
2007-07-15T07:39:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick		thnx
2007-07-15T07:40:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick		how can I allow SSH'ing into my linux box within the shell?
2007-07-15T07:40:00.000Z	Flannel	conorkirkpatrick	install openssh-server
2007-07-16T07:08:00.000Z	Flannel	conorkirkpatrick	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/OverSSH
2007-07-16T07:18:00.000Z	Flannel	conorkirkpatrick	do you have SATA drives instead of IDE drives?
2007-07-16T07:18:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	Flannel	Nope, I have Plan Old IDE drives, though one is an IBM "Deathstar"
2007-07-16T07:19:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	Flannel	but the Deathstart is working fine
2007-07-16T07:19:00.000Z	Flannel	conorkirkpatrick	er, um, I don't know.  /dev/hda should exist.  That's your primary master.  What drives do you have listed in /dev/?
2007-07-16T07:20:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	Flannel	"ls /dev | grep hd" returns nothing, but "ls /dev | grep sd" returns sda and sda1
2007-07-16T07:21:00.000Z	Flannel	conorkirkpatrick	Oh, well, uh, try that then.  I do remember hearing something about feisty mapping everything to sdX
2007-07-16T07:22:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	Flannel	Fdisk on any SD* drives causes it to say the same error "Unable to open"
2007-07-16T07:22:00.000Z	Flannel	conorkirkpatrick	you're using sudo, right?
2007-07-16T07:22:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	Flannel	...
2007-07-16T07:22:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	Flannel	WOW n00b mistake there :D
2007-07-16T07:22:00.000Z	Flannel	conorkirkpatrick	sudo fdisk /dev/whatever
2007-07-16T07:23:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	Flannel	Could cfdisk be used? I am more accustomed to it
2007-07-16T07:23:00.000Z	Flannel	conorkirkpatrick	actually, all of this will be done with sudo.  You might be better off using `sudo -i` to open a root shell, and then doing all this stuff
2007-07-16T07:23:00.000Z	Flannel	conorkirkpatrick	sure, All that's doing is partitioning.  you can use whatever you'd like.
2007-07-16T07:24:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	Flannel	Just a question (not that it matters) Do you have any idea why the HD was mounted as sda? (I know it is the hard drive because it says W95 and that was my prev. os)
2007-07-16T07:25:00.000Z	Flannel	conorkirkpatrick	Well, I don't have feisty to confirm, but I heard someone say that in feisty they moved everything to be sdX to simplify things, or something like that.
2007-07-16T07:25:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	Flannel	Ok, wasn't used to that, though it does seem better, to have all drives on one prefix
