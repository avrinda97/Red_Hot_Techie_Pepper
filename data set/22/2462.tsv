2009-06-10T01:47:00.000Z	edbian		What is Martinp23 talking about?  How do you identify to the NickServ?
2009-06-10T01:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	edbian	if your nick is not registered with nickserv, ignore that
2009-07-23T19:25:00.000Z	lstarnes	edbian	you'll probably have to remove them manually
2009-07-23T19:26:00.000Z	edbian	lstarnes	Maybe I could write a script?
2009-07-26T03:01:00.000Z	lstarnes	edbian	he already said what his problem was as Guest89323
2009-07-31T03:56:00.000Z	lstarnes	edbian	no, just identify to nickserv
2009-07-31T03:56:00.000Z	edbian	lstarnes	Will I have to "/identify" ??
2009-07-31T03:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	edbian	/msg nickserv identify <password>
2009-07-31T03:57:00.000Z	edbian	lstarnes	Everytime?
2009-07-31T03:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	edbian	yes
2009-07-31T03:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	edbian	you can probably set your client to do that for you automatically
2009-07-31T03:57:00.000Z	edbian	lstarnes	What is the point of this?
2009-07-31T03:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	edbian	it's the same as registering anywhere else
2009-07-31T03:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	edbian	if your client has a server password option, use your nickserv password as the server password for freenode.  That will identify you automatically
2009-07-31T03:58:00.000Z	edbian	lstarnes	I am new ot irc chats but I can't think of any other channels that I have to identify to join
2009-07-31T03:59:00.000Z	lstarnes	edbian	you also need a registered nick in order to register channels, be added to chanserv's access lists with special permissiions, or make it so that nobody else can use your nick.  See /msg nickserv help set enforce    for how to keep others from using your nick
2009-08-18T04:28:00.000Z	lstarnes	edbian	Giddorah: I think it's called konsole
2010-01-01T12:37:00.000Z	lstarnes	edbian	openoffice, I think
2010-01-02T12:20:00.000Z	edbian	lstarnes	Really?
2010-01-02T12:21:00.000Z	edbian	lstarnes	puppy linux does for sure.  I don't know if ubuntu has that capability yet though
2010-01-02T12:26:00.000Z	edbian	lstarnes	constantine, it's not sentient yet...
2010-01-02T12:27:00.000Z	edbian	lstarnes	constantine , I think that's planned for 10.10
