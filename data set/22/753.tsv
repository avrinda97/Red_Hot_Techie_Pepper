2011-04-05T19:06:00.000Z	waynerr		the same system btw ran windows xp / windows 7 x64 for years without problems like that
2011-04-05T19:07:00.000Z	waynerr		so mainly i think it has todo with crappy drivers in linux
2011-04-05T19:08:00.000Z	waynerr		another quite funny problem is that everytime after a reset of the system sound is set to loud while the volumebar remembers the setting from the last time
2011-04-05T19:09:00.000Z	waynerr		childish problems for an os in the year 2011 if you ask me
2011-04-05T19:11:00.000Z	waynerr		the rest of these "Opensource Gurus" just sits there and says "flash have to fix it"
2011-04-05T19:12:00.000Z	waynerr		thats opensource world in the year 2011, no wonder my windows ran alot more stabile on desktop :/
2011-04-05T19:12:00.000Z	sipior	waynerr	this sort of discussion is off-topic here.
2011-04-05T19:19:00.000Z	waynerr	sipior	i will brush it under the carpet, start my windows 7 again and tell anyone who ask me that linux for desktop is still just crap, same like 10 years ago ;)
2011-04-05T19:28:00.000Z	sipior	waynerr	do what you like. only don't tell me about it.
2011-04-05T20:27:00.000Z	sipior	waynerr	running which version of ubuntu?
2011-04-05T20:29:00.000Z	sipior	waynerr	you mean the player-specific volume setting is at maximum?
2011-04-05T20:31:00.000Z	waynerr	sipior	the system volume bar for example is at 15%, the players at 100%, now when i start something it gets outputted with 100% systemvolume
2011-04-05T20:31:00.000Z	sipior	waynerr	that's fine, we got what you meant :-)
2011-04-05T20:34:00.000Z	sipior	waynerr	if you run "pavucontrol", what is the listing for the system volume?
2011-04-05T20:36:00.000Z	waynerr	sipior	isnt installed should i ?
2011-04-05T20:36:00.000Z	sipior	waynerr	please do.
2011-04-05T20:42:00.000Z	waynerr	sipior	pavucontrol shows my volume at 15% after a restart of the system while the player shows the same behaviour
2011-04-05T20:43:00.000Z	sipior	waynerr	is there a checkbox to save your settings, by any chance?
2011-04-05T20:44:00.000Z	waynerr	sipior	the player or the volume settings ?
2011-04-05T20:44:00.000Z	sipior	waynerr	the pavucontrol volume settings, sorry.
2011-04-05T20:47:00.000Z	sipior	waynerr	hmm. i can only find reference to old bug reports regarding resetting volume levels. shouldn't apply to you running 10.10
2011-04-05T20:47:00.000Z	waynerr	sipior	but it seems to save my settings anyway so i may try a reset again now, brb
