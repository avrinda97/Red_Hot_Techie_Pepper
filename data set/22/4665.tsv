2007-12-10T04:08:00.000Z	Slart	clarezoe	just checking here if I understand this right.. you can't connect to internet when you boot from the hard drive.. but when you use the same computer and a Live CD, it works.. right?
2007-12-10T04:08:00.000Z	clarezoe	Slart	exactly
2007-12-10T04:08:00.000Z	Slart	clarezoe	how do you connect to internet? modem? adsl? cable (comhem?)
2007-12-10T04:09:00.000Z	clarezoe	Slart	I'm using cable dhcp
2007-12-10T04:10:00.000Z	Slart	clarezoe	have you recently installed ubuntu? has the internet connection ever worked before? have you changed anything in ubuntu? installed firewalls? anything else?
2007-12-10T04:11:00.000Z	clarezoe	Slart	it works fine before, but I uninstalled SCIM, and restarted X and internet is gone
2007-12-10T04:11:00.000Z	clarezoe	Slart	yes
2007-12-10T04:11:00.000Z	clarezoe	Slart	is there's any simple way that recover from livecd?
2007-12-10T04:12:00.000Z	Slart	clarezoe	that's all you did? everything worked.. you uninstalled scim and then it didn't work..?
2007-12-10T04:12:00.000Z	clarezoe	Slart	yes
2007-12-10T04:12:00.000Z	Slart	clarezoe	have you tried reinstalling scim?
2007-12-10T04:13:00.000Z	clarezoe	Slart	I don't have internet, can't reinstall then, can't connect to the source
2007-12-10T04:13:00.000Z	clarezoe	Slart	It's wired, I don't know what to do without internet, and I can't make any changes with internet in livecd
2007-12-10T04:14:00.000Z	Slart	clarezoe	ah.. but you can install from the live cd.. I think you just have to insert the cd when you're running from the hard drive.. it will popup a dialog asking if you want to use the cd as a software source or something like that.. just answer yes and try reinstalling scim
2007-12-10T04:14:00.000Z	Slart	clarezoe	if you don't get the popup you can always go into "system, administration, software sources" and add the cd that way
2007-12-10T04:15:00.000Z	clarezoe	Slart	Ok I'll reboot and try that, wish me goodluck
2007-12-10T04:15:00.000Z	Slart	clarezoe	go kick some ubuntu butt..
2007-12-10T04:20:00.000Z	clarezoe	Slart	so wired that, after 2 times restarting, it works now
2007-12-10T04:20:00.000Z	Slart	clarezoe	ah.. sweet
2007-12-10T04:20:00.000Z	Slart	clarezoe	I still don't understand why uninstalling scim would break your network.. but life is weird like that
2007-12-10T04:21:00.000Z	clarezoe	Slart	maybe that is why ubuntu is attactive
2007-12-10T04:21:00.000Z	Slart	clarezoe	hehe.. could be.. although I would prefer a predictable os over an interesting one.. =)
