2005-07-15T07:11:00.000Z	yonil		how can i make an application run in startup ?
2005-07-15T07:12:00.000Z	ogott	yonil	in KDE?
2005-07-15T07:12:00.000Z	yonil	ogott	nope ..
2005-07-15T07:12:00.000Z	yonil	ogott	gnome
2005-07-15T07:12:00.000Z	ogott	yonil	oh, ok
2005-07-15T07:12:00.000Z	yonil	ogott	why does it matter ? i wont it to run as a daemon before gnome even starts anyway ..
2005-07-15T07:14:00.000Z	ogott	yonil	oh, ok that makes it easier (never really used gnome)
2005-07-15T07:14:00.000Z	ogott	yonil	you can create a init script
2005-07-15T07:14:00.000Z	yonil	ogott	where should i place it ?
2005-07-15T07:14:00.000Z	ogott	yonil	there should be a file called /etc/init.d/skeleton
2005-07-15T07:14:00.000Z	ogott	yonil	it's a template what it should look like
2005-07-15T07:15:00.000Z	yonil	ogott	i see... once i create it, where should i place it ?
2005-07-15T07:15:00.000Z	ogott	yonil	put it in /etc/init.d
2005-07-15T07:15:00.000Z	yonil	ogott	aight thanks ! :)
2005-07-15T07:15:00.000Z	ogott	yonil	and in /etc/rc3.d should be a link to it called "S99script"
2005-07-15T07:16:00.000Z	ogott	yonil	then it will be executed at last when the system enters runlevel 3
2005-07-15T07:16:00.000Z	ogott	yonil	/etc/rc#.d are the other runlevels
2005-07-15T07:16:00.000Z	yonil	ogott	i need a runlevel in which the network works already, do you know which one is it ? (its automatic with dhcp)
2005-07-15T07:20:00.000Z	ogott	yonil	still here?
2005-07-15T07:20:00.000Z	yonil	ogott	sure
2005-07-15T07:21:00.000Z	ogott	yonil	ok, what exactely do you wanna do?
2005-07-15T07:22:00.000Z	yonil	ogott	i wanna run a daemon whenever i boot the computer (the daemon is sending my ip to a server)
