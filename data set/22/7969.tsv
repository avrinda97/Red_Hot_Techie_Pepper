2005-12-21T12:55:00.000Z	tritium	rabeldable	that's bad advice, by the way
2005-12-21T12:57:00.000Z	rabeldable	tritium	if he doesn't want the files he can delete them... plain and simple... obviously you can't delete certain files we have not got that far yet
2005-12-21T12:58:00.000Z	tritium	rabeldable	you should not delete system files, in particular.  That will break packages
2005-12-21T12:58:00.000Z	rabeldable	tritium	sit down... he said he wanted to optimize his disk usage... he did not say how do I delete system files
2005-12-21T12:59:00.000Z	tritium	rabeldable	dude, don't be rude
2005-12-21T13:00:00.000Z	tritium	rabeldable	don't do that again, please
2005-12-21T13:03:00.000Z	tritium	rabeldable	no, you gave him bad advice.  He could have gone and deleted system files that he didn't think he needed
2005-12-21T13:05:00.000Z	tritium	rabeldable	again, don't be rude.  We try to help users not break packages.  It's a good thing, trust me.
2005-12-21T14:01:00.000Z	tritium	rabeldable	don't harrass others in private messages, or you'll be banned
2006-08-01T11:03:00.000Z	tritium	rabeldable	how the heck did you get your system into that mess?
2006-08-01T11:04:00.000Z	tritium	rabeldable	seriously, what caused that?
2006-08-01T11:05:00.000Z	tritium	rabeldable	on dapper?
2006-08-01T11:06:00.000Z	tritium	rabeldable	that's unusual for breezy to work and dapper not to
2006-08-01T11:07:00.000Z	rabeldable	tritium	not really, I'm noticing many posts in the forum about how dapper installer is broke
2006-08-01T11:07:00.000Z	tritium	rabeldable	try the alternate install image
2006-08-01T11:09:00.000Z	tritium	rabeldable	I'm just saying, the alternate install image for dapper has fewer problems
2006-08-01T11:10:00.000Z	rabeldable	tritium	ok thanks, I'll try that in the next couple of days
2006-08-01T11:17:00.000Z	rabeldable	tritium	I think i fixed it
2006-08-01T11:17:00.000Z	tritium	rabeldable	rock on!
2006-08-01T11:58:00.000Z	rabeldable	tritium	i fixed perl and breezy is now updated
2006-08-01T11:59:00.000Z	tritium	rabeldable	good job ;)
