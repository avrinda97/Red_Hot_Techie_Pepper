2010-08-02T18:54:00.000Z	blitzo	guthi	when you installed ubunti did you do a side-by-side installation?
2010-08-02T18:55:00.000Z	guthi	blitzo	no, i did a custom partion
2010-08-02T18:56:00.000Z	blitzo	guthi	can you fdisk it and still see the windows partition?
2010-08-02T18:57:00.000Z	guthi	blitzo	ya, i got it mounted, and i can see all the files in the partition, only problem is i dont see a option for it boot into windows
2010-08-02T18:58:00.000Z	blitzo	guthi	you will have to edit grub which i can't tell you how to do BUT i do have it bookmarked, hang on
2010-08-02T18:59:00.000Z	guthi	blitzo	ya, i have been trying to mess around with grub for sometime but cant do anything. tried putting a chain loader but it doesnt seem to help, but maybe your bookmark ill help

2010-08-02T19:02:00.000Z	guthi	blitzo	thanks, i will see if that helps, do u know somewhere i can talk to someone who might know more about grub2?
2010-08-02T19:03:00.000Z	blitzo	guthi	this is the place - what you do is ask your question every 5 mins - ppl are coming in and out all the time
2010-08-02T19:04:00.000Z	guthi	blitzo	aah, ok, thanks a lot, i will keep trying my luck
2010-08-02T19:05:00.000Z	blitzo	guthi	i have done it with original grub, it's not real comp,licated
2010-08-02T19:07:00.000Z	guthi	blitzo	do u mean grub legacy (the one before this crappy version2) or do u mean grub 2?
2010-08-02T19:08:00.000Z	blitzo	guthi	read the link i gave you - i think there is enough info to do what you want
2010-08-02T19:08:00.000Z	guthi	blitzo	thanks man
2010-08-02T20:16:00.000Z	blitzo	guthi	you need to manually edit /boot/grup/grub.cfg and add an entry for the windows partition - i do not know the params
2010-08-02T20:18:00.000Z	guthi	blitzo	yup, tried doing that but it just says "no such partition" when i try to boot from it or just puts a blinkor in the top left corner and just sits there
2010-08-02T20:19:00.000Z	blitzo	guthi	i have to run off to the dentist, good luck
2010-08-02T20:19:00.000Z	guthi	blitzo	ouch good luck to you
2010-08-02T20:20:00.000Z	blitzo	guthi	final thought - the boot block for windows might be hosed
2010-08-02T20:21:00.000Z	guthi	blitzo	what do i do about that? thats what i have been fearing
2010-08-02T20:29:00.000Z	blitzo	guthi	one last thing i can think of - you are specifying the wrong partition
2010-08-02T20:30:00.000Z	blitzo	guthi	grub starts counting from 0, fdisk starts at 1.  read that link i gave you.  and now i do have to go good luck
