2010-08-13T06:55:00.000Z	dsfwea23		what the heck is it with ubuntu lately?  I did another update and things broke again.  Fourth time in the last two months.  This time I have no icons on my desktop but the files are still in ~/Desktop  Last time it was my shutdown/logout buttons were corrupted.  Even after reboots.
2010-08-13T06:55:00.000Z	Izinucs	dsfwea23	must be your system.. doesn't happen here.
2010-08-13T06:56:00.000Z	dsfwea23	Izinucs	might be a good guess if it didn't happen to my wife's laptop as well
2010-08-13T06:56:00.000Z	Izinucs	dsfwea23	both the same type of lappy?
2010-08-13T06:56:00.000Z	dsfwea23	Izinucs	not even close, I have a i7 generic desktop, she has a core2 dell laptop
2010-08-13T06:57:00.000Z	dsfwea23	Izinucs	she has SSD and I've got standard HD, different hardware all the way around.
2010-08-13T06:58:00.000Z	Izinucs	dsfwea23	weird.. I've got a dell vosro 1400 .. no issues at all.
2010-08-13T06:58:00.000Z	Izinucs	dsfwea23	except maybe getting a little hotter on 10.04 then 9.10
2010-08-13T07:00:00.000Z	Izinucs	dsfwea23	did you do an upgrade from a previous release or a fresh install?
2010-08-13T07:00:00.000Z	dsfwea23	Izinucs	fresh install on my system, upgraded from 9.10 on wife's laptop
2010-08-13T07:02:00.000Z	Izinucs	dsfwea23	tried kubuntu?  I run that on my desktop after 5 years of gnome.. gnome on the lappy.. I like the new itteration of kde
2010-08-13T07:03:00.000Z	dsfwea23	Izinucs	no I haven't.  I haven't liked KDE so wanted to stick with gnome.  If I have to reinstall, I'm moving to something stable like debian
2010-08-13T07:03:00.000Z	Izinucs	dsfwea23	I never liked kde in the 3.xx versions.. but 4.xx is smooth
2010-08-13T07:05:00.000Z	dsfwea23	Izinucs	but it doesn't matter what DE/WM I use, other things are breaking.  They (ubuntu) broke my digital tablet since 9.04 when they remove HAL/evdev and replaced it with something non-working.
2010-08-13T07:05:00.000Z	dsfwea23	Izinucs	I filed bugs in 9.10 and they got closed because "it's not the current version of ubuntu"  So I moved to 10.04 and it was still broken.
2010-08-13T07:06:00.000Z	Izinucs	dsfwea23	wacom?
2010-08-13T07:06:00.000Z	dsfwea23	Izinucs	no, generic tablet that worked "out-of-the-box" in 9.04 with evdev
2010-08-13T07:07:00.000Z	dsfwea23	Izinucs	9.10 removed hal + other things that broke it.  Wacom driver did work but then they restricted support for non-wacom tablets, so even in 9.10 it wouldn't work
2010-08-13T07:07:00.000Z	Izinucs	dsfwea23	my wacom hasn't had any issues.. graphire 4 .. if you're running a tablet are you into photography?
2010-08-13T07:08:00.000Z	dsfwea23	Izinucs	I used inkscape and gimp.  it worked out of the box in 9.04 with just evdev
2010-08-13T07:09:00.000Z	Izinucs	dsfwea23	ah.. design stuff.. if you're into photography check out "darktable".. there's a ppa for it..
2010-08-13T07:09:00.000Z	dsfwea23	Izinucs	nah, more graphic design
