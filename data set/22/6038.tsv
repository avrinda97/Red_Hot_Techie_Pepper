2007-01-02T15:06:00.000Z	phr34ck		hey is there a book about Linux and includes ubuntu as well?
2007-01-02T15:08:00.000Z	phr34ck		so now Linux is not an OS ?
2007-01-02T15:08:00.000Z	phr34ck		for me, an OS is the kernel.
2007-01-02T15:08:00.000Z	phr34ck		everything else are just addons.
2007-01-02T15:09:00.000Z	phr34ck		All you need is a kernel and a shell to speak with the kernel, and voila, you have an Os.
2007-01-02T15:09:00.000Z	phr34ck		The problem with the Online stuff is that there is no consistency, they just talk about stuff here and there.
2007-01-02T15:10:00.000Z	_tristan	phr34ck	you cant do much with a shell if you dont have GNU libc
2007-01-02T15:11:00.000Z	_tristan	phr34ck	you cant interface with your hardware only using a kernel though
2007-01-02T15:12:00.000Z	_tristan	phr34ck	a shell doesnt come with the kernel
2007-01-02T15:13:00.000Z	_tristan	phr34ck	thats not entirely true either
2007-01-02T15:13:00.000Z	_tristan	phr34ck	userspace applications can access the hardware directly
2007-01-02T15:14:00.000Z	phr34ck	_tristan	how so?
2007-01-02T15:14:00.000Z	_tristan	phr34ck	user space applications are byte code and assembly instructions
2007-01-02T15:15:00.000Z	_tristan	phr34ck	yes, you need libc to make calls to the kernel from userspace
2007-01-02T15:15:00.000Z	_tristan	phr34ck	calls like read/write/ioctl
2007-01-02T15:15:00.000Z	_tristan	phr34ck	by convention its better to make a kernel module interface to a hardware device, for resource control & security issues
2007-01-02T15:16:00.000Z	_tristan	phr34ck	but the kernel is essentially "only the scheduler" and alot of modules to access hardware
2007-01-02T15:17:00.000Z	_tristan	phr34ck	sorry, theres memory management too ofcourse
2007-01-02T15:17:00.000Z	phr34ck	_tristan	those are the jobs of the kernel .. purly.
2007-01-02T15:18:00.000Z	_tristan	phr34ck	yes those are the jobs of the kernel, just a few of the many many jobs that need doing to operate your system
2007-01-02T15:19:00.000Z	_tristan	phr34ck	we were talking about: <phr34ck> for me, an OS is the kernel. <phr34ck> everything else are just addons.
2007-01-02T15:20:00.000Z	_tristan	phr34ck	so you understand I had to jump to the defense of all the rest of the free software in the GNU/Linux system :)
