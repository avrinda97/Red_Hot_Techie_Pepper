2009-04-24T22:19:00.000Z	losher		 Bo7: they are not the same. Both are optional depending on how you want your ssh to work
2009-04-24T22:19:00.000Z	Bo7	losher	I want to put my public key in it to get access
2009-04-24T22:20:00.000Z	losher		known_hosts justs keeps track of hosts you've already contacted, as a precaution against someone impersonating a server. You can delete it at any time and ssh will rebuild it adding entries each time you visit a new site

2009-04-24T22:21:00.000Z	Bo7	losher	can i just create the autorized_keys then?
2009-04-24T22:22:00.000Z	losher	Bo7	for public key access, you need to take the CLIENTs public key and put it into the SERVERs authorized_keys file.
2009-04-24T22:22:00.000Z	Bo7	losher	I'm trying to get access from a windows machine
2009-04-24T22:23:00.000Z	losher	Bo7	using putty?
2009-04-24T22:23:00.000Z	Bo7		losher,yeah
2009-04-24T22:24:00.000Z	losher	Bo7	have you checked the putty FAQ?
2009-04-24T22:25:00.000Z	Bo7	losher	I'll check it again ;)   so I don't need to generate any keys on the server at all?
2009-04-24T22:25:00.000Z	Bo7	losher	just on the client right?
2009-04-24T22:26:00.000Z	losher	Bo7	right. Only the client needs a public/private key pair, and the public key needs to be copied to the servers authorized_keys file
2009-04-24T22:27:00.000Z	Bo7	losher	I see. what does the id_rsa.keystore file do on the server?
2009-04-24T22:28:00.000Z	losher	Bo7	wow, dunno. Anyone?
2009-04-24T22:30:00.000Z	Bo7	losher	i've got an id_rsa + id_rsa.pub and now this id.rsa.keystore
2009-04-24T22:31:00.000Z	losher	Bo7	if it's on the client, I don't think it will matter. The important part is that the server has to have the clients id_rsa.pub in the servers authorized_keys file
2009-04-24T22:31:00.000Z	Bo7	losher	allright thx for the help!
2009-04-24T22:32:00.000Z	losher	Bo7	Be careful how you copy it. If you cut&paste it, you can introduce linefeeds which aren't there in the original
2009-04-24T22:33:00.000Z	Bo7	losher	okay thx
2009-04-24T22:33:00.000Z	losher	Bo7	come back if you get stuck...
2009-04-24T22:34:00.000Z	Bo7	losher	will do, thx :)
