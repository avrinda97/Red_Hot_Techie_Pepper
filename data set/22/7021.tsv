2007-08-10T10:53:00.000Z	|_ocke		it seems since i upgraded to feisty i no longer have getty and therefore have no login prompt on ctrl-alt-f1-6
2007-08-10T10:53:00.000Z	|_ocke		and tehrefore cant login to the system except in kdm or in recovery mode (which works fine)
2007-08-10T10:53:00.000Z	|_ocke		however i cant install nvidia drivers in recovery mode
2007-08-10T10:54:00.000Z	|_ocke		also, i have no /etc/inittab
2007-08-10T10:55:00.000Z	kyncani	|_ocke	upstart does not use inittab i think
2007-08-10T10:59:00.000Z	kyncani	|_ocke	upstart should have provided the ttys i think. If not, look into /etc/event.d, the command line to get ttys are there
2007-08-10T11:00:00.000Z	|_ocke	kyncani	/etc/event.d/tty1 contains "start on runlevel 2 - 5, stop on 0 1 and 6
2007-08-10T11:02:00.000Z	kyncani	|_ocke	yes, so you should have had a tty as i understand it. Nevertheless, log into X, then ( sudo getty 38400 tty1 & ) should give you a tty
2007-08-10T11:03:00.000Z	kyncani	|_ocke	right ..
2007-08-10T11:03:00.000Z	|_ocke	kyncani	it worked! finally
2007-08-10T11:04:00.000Z	kyncani	|_ocke	how's that ?
2007-08-10T11:04:00.000Z	kyncani	|_ocke	nope !
2007-08-10T11:04:00.000Z	kyncani	|_ocke	exec is the marker for the command line upstart should run when the event appear
2007-08-10T11:10:00.000Z	|_ocke	kyncani	so, im not running gnome, im running kde, how can i get to the restricted driver manager?
2007-08-10T11:29:00.000Z	kyncani	|_ocke	buy more ram
2007-08-10T11:29:00.000Z	|_ocke	kyncani	i dont buy computer equipment
2007-08-10T11:31:00.000Z	kyncani	|_ocke	:) well, here, old equipments are vax, old unixes and alpha. And i can afford equipment :)
2007-08-10T11:32:00.000Z	kyncani	|_ocke	well, i think you would be more confortable with some more ram
2007-08-10T11:33:00.000Z	|_ocke	kyncani	oh i know i would, but dont have the budget :P
2007-08-10T11:33:00.000Z	kyncani	|_ocke	steal it (kidding)
2007-08-10T11:33:00.000Z	kyncani	|_ocke	i must say kde with 2G ram is something else :)
2007-08-10T13:20:00.000Z	|_ocke	kyncani	neither is edgy
