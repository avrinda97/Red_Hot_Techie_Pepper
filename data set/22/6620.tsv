2010-08-16T04:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	cesc	maybe using at is enough? sudo at "now +2 hours" <enter> shutdown -h now <crtl + D>
2010-08-16T04:28:00.000Z	cesc	erUSUL	should I type the hole sentence "sudo at "now +2 hours" <enter> shutdown -h now <crtl + D>" in terminal window that way?
2010-08-16T04:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	cesc	no <enter> is press enter key at that point. <crtl + D> is a combo
2010-08-16T04:29:00.000Z	cesc	erUSUL	oh ok
2010-08-16T04:39:00.000Z	cesc	erUSUL	pressing ctrl+D when in terminal inside at doesn't get out of that window
2010-08-16T04:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	cesc	but you get back to the shell promt; right?
2010-08-16T04:41:00.000Z	cesc	erUSUL	No.. I'm in at> shutdown -h now

2010-08-16T04:56:00.000Z	cesc	erUSUL	 maybe we have different keyboard layouts and CTRL+D works differently from each other... damn it.. now I don't know how to exit to shell promt.
2010-08-16T04:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	cesc	crtl + c ?
