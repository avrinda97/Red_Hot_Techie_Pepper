2006-07-12T06:04:00.000Z	usama	compengi	replace minus with plus
2006-07-12T06:05:00.000Z	compengi	usama	chmod: invalid mode: `+R'
2006-07-12T06:06:00.000Z	usama	compengi	no, i mean o+rw
2006-07-12T06:13:00.000Z	compengi	usama	Cannot write to `psyBNC-2.3.2-7.tar.gz' (Permission denied).
2006-07-12T06:13:00.000Z	compengi	usama	still the same problem
2006-07-12T06:13:00.000Z	usama	compengi	add sudo before the command
2006-07-12T06:13:00.000Z	compengi	usama	i did
2006-07-12T06:14:00.000Z	usama	compengi	then login by root account and do what you want
2006-07-12T06:15:00.000Z	compengi	usama	i'm a root, but i have a friend that i made him a user but he can't do anything
2006-07-12T06:15:00.000Z	usama		when i give command "sudo make menuconfig" i receive the error "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lncurses"
2006-07-12T06:16:00.000Z	usama	compengi	are you doing that in ntfs drive?
2006-07-12T06:16:00.000Z	compengi	usama	lol
2006-07-12T06:16:00.000Z	compengi	usama	of course no
2006-07-12T06:18:00.000Z	usama	compengi	will you tel me the exact command you put?
2006-07-12T06:18:00.000Z	compengi	usama	what command
2006-07-12T06:19:00.000Z	usama	compengi	dont you give the command "sudo chmod -R o-rw some_dir"
2006-07-12T06:20:00.000Z	compengi	usama	yes
2006-07-12T06:20:00.000Z	compengi	usama	i did what you told me to sudo chmod -R o+rw some_dir
2006-07-12T06:21:00.000Z	usama	compengi	then it should not say "permission denied" until the filesystem is mounted in read-mode
2006-07-12T06:25:00.000Z	compengi	usama	i opened properties on file system and went on to permissions they are all marked on read for all(owner,group,other)
