2006-03-12T10:31:00.000Z	slew		hello. im trying to compile mplayer from the ubuntu wiki, i put this line: ./configure --enable-gui --enable-largefiles --enable-menu --prefix=/usr \
2006-03-12T10:31:00.000Z	slew		 --confdir=/etc/mplayer but yet i get this error: MPlayer was compiled WITHOUT GUI support. why???!
2006-03-12T10:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	slew	unless you still have ubuntu 5.04 you don't need to compile your own mplayer anymore
2006-03-12T10:33:00.000Z	slew	Amaranth	ok, but dont you think the gui should work?
2006-03-12T10:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	slew	sudo apt-get build-dep mplayer
2006-03-12T10:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	slew	then rerun the ./configure
2006-03-12T10:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	slew	for every deb line in sources.list there should be a matching deb-src line
2006-03-12T10:35:00.000Z	slew	Amaranth	there is
2006-03-12T10:35:00.000Z	Amaranth	slew	not with ubuntu
2006-03-12T10:35:00.000Z	slew	Amaranth	a matching source line for the deb. in my sources.list.
2006-03-12T10:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	slew	oh

2006-03-12T10:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	slew	remove the #s from the deb-src lines
2006-03-12T10:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	slew	yes
2006-03-12T10:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	slew	make clean first
2006-03-12T10:47:00.000Z	slew	Amaranth	sudo make clean or just make clean, then make install?
