2011-09-17T20:53:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero		Perhaps someone can help me? I tried to install Ubuntu (with the Windows installer) which idn't give me any trouble, but I can't figure out how to start my computer using Ubuntu... There is no menu screen on startup, like the install page illustrates
2011-09-17T20:55:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero		Well, crap.
2011-09-17T20:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	FoxtrotZero	 wubi makes a special boot menu item to boot to the Ubuntu Wubi install.   I dont reccomend using wubi.
2011-09-17T21:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	FoxtrotZero	 thats now it normally works.
2011-09-17T21:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	FoxtrotZero	 if you did a  wubi install , somthing must have messed up.
2011-09-17T21:03:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	dr_willis	The install was interrupted for a reason I don't understand the first time, which caused my computer to spontaneously restart. Multitasking isn't a good idea. When the computer came back on, I reopened the wubi installer, and it said something about deleting the old installaion.
2011-09-17T21:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	FoxtrotZero	  sounds like you need to reinstall wubi.
2011-09-17T21:04:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	dr_willis	Already tried that, but yeah, i'm going with the normal install.
2011-09-17T21:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	FoxtrotZero	 you can have a large # of parittions. but you can only have 4 primary parittions.  thats often an issue on new machines. the win7  setups often are using all 4 primaries to begin with
2011-09-17T21:08:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	dr_willis	Well i'm running Win XP Media Center SP3, so I doubt that's an issue.
2011-09-17T21:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	FoxtrotZero	 fire up gparted and partition how you want then. :)
2011-09-17T21:09:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	dr_willis	Partitions are new to me. The hell is gparted?
2011-09-17T21:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	FoxtrotZero	 you can put the iso on the 2gb flash and boot the flash..   you will want a few gb on the hd to install to.
2011-09-17T21:11:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	dr_willis	I have well over 130GB free, so no worries there
2011-09-18T07:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	FoxtrotZero	 what version of windows?
2011-09-18T07:45:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	dr_willis	WinXP Media Center SP3
2011-09-18T07:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	FoxtrotZero	 old skool. :) heh.   well i was going to mention that Win7 - has a nice feature to resize itself.. but that dont apply here.,
2011-09-18T07:47:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	dr_willis	Like I said, according to GParted there's some way for it to just ignore the bad sector - it seems like it won't resize more than a few hundred MiB because of it - but I don't know a damned thing about this program.
2011-09-18T07:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	FoxtrotZero	 ive never used that option.   gpated is a front end to ntfsresize - you might  to just use ntfsresize from the cli.
2011-09-18T08:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	FoxtrotZero	 ubuntu one is 5gb now :)
2011-09-18T08:13:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	dr_willis	Huh?
2011-09-18T08:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	FoxtrotZero	 backup whats critical to ubuntuone or some other dropbox type site.. and gamble on the rest staying  there.
