2008-08-03T20:58:00.000Z	moren8	bazhang	can you help me??
2008-08-03T20:58:00.000Z	moren8	bazhang	i have reinstalled 6 times ubuntu:(
2008-08-03T20:58:00.000Z	bazhang	moren8	is this hardy heron? also does sound work on initial install (or via live cd)? when did it stop working if so
2008-08-03T20:59:00.000Z	moren8	bazhang	 yes the sound works fine!!! but i have to recompile the kernel to enable the pae
2008-08-03T21:00:00.000Z	bazhang	moren8	for the extra ram I presume
2008-08-03T21:00:00.000Z	moren8	bazhang	exact! the 64 bit ubuntu is not for me!
2008-08-03T21:00:00.000Z	bazhang	moren8	why not use 32bit then; how much ram do you have
2008-08-03T21:01:00.000Z	moren8	bazhang	i have 4gigs, and they works now whit the pae but, when i recompiled the kernel... the audio stops working...
2008-08-03T21:02:00.000Z	bazhang	moren8	compiling your own kernel is really not the best option if you are not sure what you are doing; have you asked in #alsa yet?
2008-08-03T21:02:00.000Z	moren8	bazhang	and i tried to recompile alsa... whit sources but i dont have version.h
2008-08-03T21:02:00.000Z	moren8	bazhang	no i don't!
2008-08-03T21:03:00.000Z	moren8	bazhang	but is the only thing for have 4gig ram
2008-08-03T21:04:00.000Z	bazhang	moren8	what about 64 bit live cd; does that work?
2008-08-03T21:05:00.000Z	bazhang	moren8	fixing flash for 64bit is much easier than what you are trying to do :)
2008-08-03T21:05:00.000Z	bazhang	moren8	^^
