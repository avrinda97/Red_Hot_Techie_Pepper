2011-06-13T13:32:00.000Z	alvinPH		is it safe to install a 64bit version to my intel atom?
2011-06-13T13:32:00.000Z	theadmin	alvinPH	If it's 64-bit, yes
2011-06-13T13:32:00.000Z	theadmin	alvinPH	If it's not it won't work
2011-06-13T13:36:00.000Z	theadmin	alvinPH	Nah, 32-bit can work on any 64-bit machine
2011-06-13T13:39:00.000Z	theadmin	alvinPH	64-bit supports 4+ gigs of RAM
2011-06-13T13:40:00.000Z	alvinPH	theadmin	is that all? but why does ubuntu provides specific ISO for 64bit if 32bit can still be run on 64bit?
2011-06-13T13:41:00.000Z	alvinPH	theadmin	is that all? but why does ubuntu provides specific ISO for 64bit if 32bit can still be run on 64bit machine?
2011-06-13T13:41:00.000Z	theadmin	alvinPH	If you don't install a 64-bit OS you won't get that advantage
2011-06-13T13:42:00.000Z	alvinPH	theadmin	ahh, the support for 4gig ram will not be accomodated by the 32bit installed OS in a 64bit machine?
2011-06-13T13:43:00.000Z	theadmin	alvinPH	Right
2011-06-13T13:45:00.000Z	alvinPH	theadmin	what if a 32bit OS is unknowned as 32bit and installed in a 64bit os with for example 8gig of ram, what will comeout in the system monitor?
2011-06-13T13:45:00.000Z	theadmin	alvinPH	Something like "3.2GB RAM available, 512MB in use"
2011-06-13T13:46:00.000Z	alvinPH	theadmin	ahh, so the ram beyond 4gig will not be utilized by the system?
2011-06-13T13:46:00.000Z	theadmin	alvinPH	Yah
2011-06-13T13:47:00.000Z	alvinPH	theadmin	yess! i know now.. hehehe :D
