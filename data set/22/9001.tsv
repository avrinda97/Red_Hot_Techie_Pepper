2005-04-12T11:18:00.000Z	saik0	crimsun	ahhh works, but the video is choppy with DVDs in both VLC and with gstreamer. any suggestions?
2005-04-13T16:52:00.000Z	crimsun	saik0	it's in capplets
2005-04-13T16:52:00.000Z	crimsun	saik0	dpkg -S libgnome-window-settings.so.1
2005-04-13T16:52:00.000Z	crimsun	saik0	(though I recommend installing dlocate instead)
2005-04-13T16:56:00.000Z	saik0	crimsun	thanks alot. ok now that i know it does indeed belong to capplets is there any way I can install that one file again?
2005-04-13T16:57:00.000Z	crimsun	saik0	--reinstall
2005-04-13T05:00:00.000Z	saik0	crimsun	dpkg: unknown option --reinstall (did'nt see it in the manpage either)
2005-04-13T05:00:00.000Z	crimsun	saik0	apt-get --reinstall install
2005-04-13T05:02:00.000Z	saik0	crimsun	well that would explain both why it does not work and why I could'nt find anything like it in the dpkg manpage now would'nt it
2005-04-13T05:02:00.000Z	crimsun	saik0	indeed.
2005-04-13T05:03:00.000Z	saik0	crimsun	uhoh....may I msg you something the terminal spat out?
2005-04-22T10:21:00.000Z	crimsun	saik0	have you tried just dragging the thing to the top?
2005-04-22T10:20:00.000Z	crimsun	saik0	yes, change the placement of it.
2005-04-22T10:20:00.000Z	crimsun	saik0	in Settings
2005-04-22T10:21:00.000Z	saik0	crimsun	there is no placement menu in the panel settings =\
2005-04-22T10:21:00.000Z	crimsun	saik0	huh?
2005-04-22T10:22:00.000Z	saik0	crimsun	wow I did'nt expect it to be that intuitive (however thats spelled) I like it
2005-04-22T10:23:00.000Z	saik0	crimsun	now how does one make it stretch across the screen?
2005-04-22T10:24:00.000Z	crimsun	saik0	that I don't know offhand, because I'm in gnome atm
