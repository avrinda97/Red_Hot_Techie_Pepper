2009-05-15T11:01:00.000Z	Xyzyxx		it says (initramfs)_
2009-05-15T11:01:00.000Z	Xyzyxx		maybe it's not detecting my disk at all... checking cables
2009-05-15T11:02:00.000Z	Evil_saltine	Xyzyxx	What does it say above that line?
2009-05-15T11:02:00.000Z	Xyzyxx		uh
2009-05-15T11:02:00.000Z	Xyzyxx		BusyBox
2009-05-15T11:03:00.000Z	Evil_saltine	Xyzyxx	it just dumped you to a shell right?
2009-05-15T11:03:00.000Z	Xyzyxx		and some lunix stuff
2009-05-15T11:03:00.000Z	Xyzyxx		I'll look again
2009-05-15T11:04:00.000Z	Xyzyxx	Evil_saltine	yes, after I hit install, I see a loading bar, then the prompt appears
2009-05-15T11:04:00.000Z	Evil_saltine	Xyzyxx	Is the loading bar moving back and forth, or is it moving left to right like a progress bar?
2009-05-15T11:04:00.000Z	Xyzyxx		and I can explore some directories which I have no idea how
2009-05-15T11:05:00.000Z	Xyzyxx	Evil_saltine	it's red with a yellow dot that bounces
2009-05-15T11:05:00.000Z	Xyzyxx		back and forth
2009-05-15T11:05:00.000Z	Evil_saltine	Xyzyxx	It's not able to mount the compressed image on your CD for some reason
2009-05-15T11:06:00.000Z	Xyzyxx		ok, prompt is back
2009-05-15T11:06:00.000Z	Evil_saltine	Xyzyxx	I guess either the CD is bad or it's not detecting it for some reason
2009-05-15T11:06:00.000Z	Evil_saltine	Xyzyxx	What is the first line that looks like an error message?
2009-05-15T11:07:00.000Z	Xyzyxx		BusyBox v1.10.2 (Ubuntu 1:1.10.2-2ubuntu7) built-in shell (ash)
2009-05-15T11:07:00.000Z	Xyzyxx		Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands
2009-05-15T11:08:00.000Z	Xyzyxx		should I redownload and re-burn the installer
2009-05-15T11:11:00.000Z	Xyzyxx	Evil_saltine	all it says is BusyBox v1.10.2 (Ubuntu 1:1.10.2-2ubuntu7) built-in shell (ash)
2009-05-15T11:11:00.000Z	Evil_saltine	Xyzyxx	You could try to find the error message, but at this point I would try a new CD
