2008-06-25T07:11:00.000Z	NetEcho_		is there a way to install a RPM under Ubuntu (Apparently the java plugin Ubuntu has doesn't work , I have websites still telling me to install JRE and giving me this .rpm)
2008-06-25T07:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NetEcho_	Not a goot idea to alien an rpm
2008-06-25T07:12:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Jack_Sparrow	 the RPM is from java.com
2008-06-25T07:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NetEcho_	It does not matter where it came from.

2008-06-25T07:32:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Jack_Sparrow	 is there somewhere I can go in Ubuntu to try to mount usb devices that don't auto-mount?
2008-06-25T07:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NetEcho_	there is an option in the menus for automounting removeable devices.. I have run across some usb's that are a problem.. but mostly it is when they are not properly unmounted from a systrem theat thay get locked down
2008-06-25T07:34:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Jack_Sparrow	it usualy does auto-mount them but this specific mp3 player goes straight to sleep mode when I plug it in to the PC Basicly PC zzzzzzz - zzzzzzz Mp3player
2008-06-25T07:34:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Jack_Sparrow	 its also the first time I've plugged this one in
2008-06-25T07:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NetEcho_	you can try sudo /etc/init.d/hal restart   to try and get a usb drive recognized..
2008-06-25T07:34:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Jack_Sparrow	will do
2008-06-25T07:36:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Jack_Sparrow	 nope didn't make a difference
2008-06-25T07:43:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Jack_Sparrow	because of ubuntu lacking support for my mom's 2gb rechargable mp3 player she just got punked for my 1gb AAA battery mp3 player :P
2008-06-25T07:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NetEcho_	most mp3 players have a mode that lets them look like a flash or removeable drive..  all of mine work.. 4 diffedrent ones
2008-06-25T07:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NetEcho_	The ipod ones..  are a different matter
2008-06-25T07:44:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Jack_Sparrow	 this one is a pretty cheap one so tis probably an issue with it
2008-06-25T07:45:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Jack_Sparrow	Sylvania 2gb cost like $10 at the grocery store
2008-06-25T07:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NetEcho_	read the manual. there is almost always a way to get it to read
2008-06-25T07:45:00.000Z	NetEcho_	Jack_Sparrow	 tis fine I wanted this one instead of mine anyway lol
2008-06-25T07:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NetEcho_	what make and model.. let me try and look it up
2008-06-25T07:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NetEcho_	np
