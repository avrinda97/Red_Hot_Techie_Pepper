2012-02-21T01:49:00.000Z	saryth		Hey, sometimes, in firefox, .exe and zip are registered to notepad. Is there anyway to change them to their programs?
2012-02-21T01:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saryth	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc

2012-02-21T01:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saryth	is firefox running via wine?
2012-02-21T01:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saryth	cool, ok lets see

2012-02-21T01:56:00.000Z	saryth	ActionParsnip	It's associated with Wine and Archive Manager, for exe and zip respectively, however, they show up as unknown in FF and open in notepad
2012-02-21T01:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saryth	doesn't firefox have its own associations...?
2012-02-21T01:57:00.000Z	saryth	ActionParsnip	Lemme check....
2012-02-21T01:58:00.000Z	saryth	ActionParsnip	Yes, but both are set to "Always ask". It asks, but only gives me notepad as an option
2012-02-21T02:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saryth	link is bad
2012-02-21T02:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saryth	do you use the dropbox app in Ubuntu?
2012-02-21T02:04:00.000Z	saryth	ActionParsnip	Yes, I uploaded it directly from Shutter, however. Here's a new link
2012-02-21T02:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saryth	in the public folder, you can right click a file and under the dropbox entry you can click to copy the public address
2012-02-21T02:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saryth	drop down the box and click 'other app...'
2012-02-21T02:06:00.000Z	saryth	ActionParsnip	It's a Find File, I'm assuming I'm going to have to find Wine and Archive manager files manually?
2012-02-21T02:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saryth	wine will be /usr/bin/wine
2012-02-21T02:09:00.000Z	saryth	ActionParsnip	It opens in wine once, but then, with a new download, it says notepad again.
2012-02-21T02:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saryth	download the file.Right click the file and change association there
2012-02-21T02:11:00.000Z	saryth	ActionParsnip	It's just awkward if I want the file only once, but I guess that's my only option. Thanks anway.
