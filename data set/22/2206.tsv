2009-08-22T03:37:00.000Z	vr_mex		I just installed U904  desktop, is there a metapakage for a lamp stack or do I have to install each component separately?
2009-08-22T03:37:00.000Z	dest_	vr_mex	I think you have to install each comp separately
2009-08-22T03:38:00.000Z	vr_mex	dest_	th0r , thanks a lot
2009-08-22T03:38:00.000Z	dest_	vr_mex	you know how to do it ?
2009-08-22T03:39:00.000Z	vr_mex	dest_	yes but when you install the server it is done in a easy way you dont have to do one by one...
2009-08-22T03:40:00.000Z	dest_	vr_mex	I believe that if you do aptitude install phpmyadmin mysql-server. It should download apache, php and mysql-server.
2009-08-22T03:40:00.000Z	vr_mex	dest_	that si nice ;-)
2009-08-22T03:41:00.000Z	dest_	vr_mex	but it doesn't cost much to add apache on the line. Check the correct name with an aptitude search apache
2009-08-22T03:42:00.000Z	vr_mex	dest_	ok thanks a lot, let me see what version of php and mysql that installs...
2009-08-22T03:43:00.000Z	dest_	vr_mex	indead, maybe you should precise which version of php you want. I'm not sure which one it takes by default
2009-08-22T03:43:00.000Z	vr_mex	dest_	php5, mysql5 and apache2
2009-08-22T03:44:00.000Z	dest_	vr_mex	sounds good to me. But in my case, I also take phpmyadmin to set up the database easily
2009-08-22T03:44:00.000Z	vr_mex	dest_	yep definitely, me too... ;-)
2009-08-22T03:46:00.000Z	vr_mex	dest_	if i install via tasksel will it be compatible with update manager ?
2009-08-22T03:48:00.000Z	dest_	vr_mex	I don't know tasksel but I've always done with aptitude
2009-08-22T03:48:00.000Z	vr_mex	dest_	do you know what the carrot does in this command? sudo apt-get install lamp-server^
2009-08-22T03:49:00.000Z	dest_	vr_mex	I don't understand your question
2009-08-22T03:50:00.000Z	vr_mex	dest_	do you know what the carrat at the end of this command line does in this command? sudo apt-get install lamp-server^
2009-08-22T03:51:00.000Z	dest_	vr_mex	nope but it shouldn't be there
2009-08-22T03:53:00.000Z	dest_	vr_mex	i guess it's for regular expression
2009-08-22T03:53:00.000Z	dest_	vr_mex	I've never used it
2009-08-22T03:54:00.000Z	vr_mex	dest_	thanks a lot too ;-)
