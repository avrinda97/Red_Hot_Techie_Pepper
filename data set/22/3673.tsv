2008-07-04T05:49:00.000Z	RonLut1		So, no one can really help me?
2008-07-04T05:50:00.000Z	Lynet	RonLut1	In firefox preferences, Applications. What application is set to open the files you have problems with?
2008-07-04T05:52:00.000Z	RonLut1	Lynet	"Use movie player (default)"
2008-07-04T05:52:00.000Z	Lynet	RonLut1	Try changing it, see if that helps.
2008-07-04T05:54:00.000Z	RonLut1	Lynet	I don't really know how do I put VLC into it... it only have the option "Use VLC Multimedia Plugin (in Firefox)" or browse for the app..... I don't know how do I find vlc application file
2008-07-04T05:54:00.000Z	RonLut1	Lynet	and VLC PLUGIN isn't working... I treid already
2008-07-04T05:55:00.000Z	Lynet	RonLut1	vlc is /usr/bin/vlc
2008-07-04T05:57:00.000Z	RonLut1	Lynet	Now works, thanks :) BTW, why most of the videos I watch are smudgy in ubuntu?
2008-07-04T05:58:00.000Z	Lynet	RonLut1	What do you mean by smudgy?

2008-07-04T06:03:00.000Z	Lynet	RonLut1	Ouch. That's some nasty macroblock damage. Do you happen to know which codec that video uses?
2008-07-04T06:04:00.000Z	RonLut1	Lynet	hmmm.... no... but I guess I can check it, somehow..?
2008-07-04T06:04:00.000Z	RonLut1	Lynet	It's not in all videos... but in a lot of them
2008-07-04T06:05:00.000Z	Lynet	RonLut1	Trying to find some common denominator would help a lot in figuring out what is wrong.
2008-07-04T06:14:00.000Z	RonLut1	Lynet	codec is: S-Mpeg 4 v2
2008-07-04T06:16:00.000Z	RonLut1	Lynet	(?)
2008-07-04T06:17:00.000Z	Lynet	RonLut1	Ah. That would be MicroSoft's almost-iso-mpeg4-compliant proprietary codec. You might need the win32/win64codec package to playback those properly.
2008-07-04T06:20:00.000Z	Lynet	RonLut1	  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu#Adding%20the%20Repositories After adding the repository, install w32codecs (or w64codecs if you use 64bit ubuntu).
2008-07-04T06:23:00.000Z	RonLut1	Lynet	Thank you very much... searched it in google but didn't find... you found it.... I'll try it now
2008-07-04T06:26:00.000Z	RonLut1	Lynet	it still happens :(
2008-07-04T06:29:00.000Z	Lynet	RonLut1	Dang, not really sure what other advise to give you. MSMPEG4 v1/2/3 is unfortunately one of the few video codecs that Linux has trouble with.
2008-07-04T06:29:00.000Z	RonLut1	Lynet	ok NVM, thanks anyway for your help...
