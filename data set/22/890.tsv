2011-02-13T08:04:00.000Z	truepurple		When I go to download ubuntu 10.10 64bit, it has "amd" right before "64" Why?  Is it saying that its only for AMD CPU's or something?
2011-02-13T08:05:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	Intel borrowed AMD's technology for 64-bit because Intel's implementation wasn't good.
2011-02-13T08:38:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	Why the obsession with FAT16? You stick it on a bootable medium and pop it in. Let Ubuntu take car eo fthe formatting. I believe the default is ext4, and usually defaults are good. :)
2011-02-13T08:39:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	Told you about what? What needs to be in FAT16?
2011-02-13T08:39:00.000Z	truepurple	Starminn	the usb flash drive perhaps?
2011-02-13T08:42:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	You are making it from WIndows, correct?
2011-02-13T08:42:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	And you are doing Desktop version of Ubuntu? (Not netbook)
2011-02-13T08:42:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download Go to step 2, choose USB stick, choose making it from Windows, thensay "Show me how"
2011-02-13T08:43:00.000Z	truepurple	Starminn	desktop 10.10 64bit
2011-02-13T08:43:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	So choose 64-bit on step 1 as well.
2011-02-13T08:44:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	So follow the wonderful step-by-step with screenshots on how to do it, and you'll be golden. If it doesn't work after you slpit the ISO, follow what people are saying about the MD5
2011-02-13T08:44:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	That's not anyone's fault then. IF there's no HDD space we cannot do anything about that.
2011-02-13T08:46:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	I gave you the reference, buddy. On the official UBuntu site, giving you a step-by-step.
2011-02-13T08:47:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	Seeing as they do not mention anything about requiring a FAT16 formatted USB stick on that page, you can assume you don't need one.
2011-02-13T08:47:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	It's hard to prove a negative. Did you expect to see, "You don't need a FAT16!" No, do you see "You need FAT16" no, so you don't.
2011-02-13T08:49:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	Never know till you try then, eh?
2011-02-13T08:49:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	If something doesn't work, try something else, alright? We obviously don't know everything you DON'T need for Ubuntu -- just what you DO need.
2011-02-13T08:50:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	If it won't work, try formatting it as FAT16
2011-02-13T08:50:00.000Z	truepurple	Starminn	Would you please help me compare that usb installer to unetbootin anyway?
2011-02-13T08:55:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	ubottu said "Ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots" is you insist on not trying it yourself.
2011-02-13T08:55:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	Stop it. This channel is not for polling, so you may not do so here.
2011-02-13T08:57:00.000Z	Starminn	truepurple	*sigh* You are asking "What is best." As ubottu tells you, "Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors." Please abide by that, and realize that because of this, no one will be able to answer you properly. As a result of it being "up to you to choose" you must do just that -- try and choose.
