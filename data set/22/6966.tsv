2006-08-25T08:28:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	I suggest sending a message onto ubuntu-users, if there are none who know more about sound issues here at the moment.
2006-08-25T08:30:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	No, the mailing list ubuntu-users@lists.ubuntu.com
2006-08-25T08:30:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	See http://lists.ubuntu.com about more info.
2006-08-25T08:31:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	There your questions will be seen by all who know more deeply about it.
2006-08-25T08:32:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	Sound issues might be very difficult to deal with, and maybe no one just are experienced about it, of whom are inside here now. :)
2006-08-25T08:32:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	Can you give a link to the forum thread?
2006-08-25T08:33:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	Thanks, I'll head towards that in a sec.
2006-08-25T08:36:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	Found a site that says you have to enable CONFIG_SND_HDA_INTEL in the kernel.
2006-08-25T08:36:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	Have you tried that? See http://www.lorenzobettini.it/linux/LinuxSonyVaioVGN-S5VP_B for more info. It seems to require recompiling the kernel...
2006-08-25T08:37:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	Maybe nobody just knew about it, of those people who were present at the time.
2006-08-25T08:38:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	You seem to be new here, so I'll just add that all who hang around here are mostly users of Ubuntu, there are no paid devs (or that many anyway) so it's basically just people like you and me who help each other. If I don't have experience on the issues you have to deal with, then there's no point getting furious about it. :)
2006-08-25T08:39:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	No, it's not _that_ hard. Lemme find a wiki page for you.
2006-08-25T08:39:00.000Z	Bacta	AstralJava	sorry...im not angry
2006-08-25T08:40:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	That's okay, just making sure you understand the nature of this chatroom. :)
2006-08-25T08:40:00.000Z	Bacta	AstralJava	i know and it does impress me that u guys are doing this for free...its just i've had this prob for days *cries*
2006-08-25T08:41:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	There's a page like this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile?highlight=%28kernel%29
2006-08-25T08:42:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	If there's a driver for it, that's always better, don't, I repeat, don't compile a custom kernel before you try that out first.
2006-08-25T08:45:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	Good luck, and ask questions before doing anything dramatic. :)
2006-08-25T08:45:00.000Z	AstralJava	Bacta	Sure. :)
