2010-03-18T05:30:00.000Z	Gnea	madjoe	traceroute works just fine here
2010-03-18T05:31:00.000Z	madjoe	Gnea	hm.. I've seen lots of reports that it doens't work.. and it doesn't work for me... am I missing something here?
2010-03-18T05:31:00.000Z	Gnea	madjoe	some sites block traceroute, some don't.
2010-03-18T05:32:00.000Z	madjoe	Gnea	I've tried it on Google, and my own sites - nothing seems to work
2010-03-18T05:32:00.000Z	Gnea	madjoe	perhaps your country restricts its use
2010-03-18T05:33:00.000Z	madjoe	Gnea	maybe... perhaps I should call my ISP, or someone...
2010-03-18T05:33:00.000Z	Gnea	madjoe	I can traceroute yahoo.com just fine here
2010-03-18T05:34:00.000Z	madjoe	Gnea	this is how I see it http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1149996 BTW, Can you try to traceroute to my ip? 93.141.2.188
2010-03-18T05:37:00.000Z	Gnea	madjoe	9  CROATIAN-TELECOM.POS8-0-0.ar2.VIE1.gblx.net (64.215.185.194)  156.951 ms  157.245 ms  157.655 ms
2010-03-18T05:37:00.000Z	madjoe	Gnea	what's that?
2010-03-18T05:38:00.000Z	Gnea	madjoe	that's the 9th hop, from there it's all *'s
2010-03-18T05:38:00.000Z	madjoe	Gnea	oh, well.. I'm trying to investigate where the problem is.. so you can hop to croatian network then? but not to go all the way to my pc?
2010-03-18T05:39:00.000Z	Gnea	madjoe	correct.
2010-03-18T05:39:00.000Z	madjoe	Gnea	so "the problem" is between me and my ISP
2010-03-18T05:40:00.000Z	Gnea	madjoe	I think you're right
2010-03-18T05:40:00.000Z	madjoe	Gnea	could it possible be my configuration's fault? is there something I should do with Ubuntu to double check it? firewall (which I haven't installed), or something like that?
2010-03-18T05:41:00.000Z	Gnea	madjoe	not likely, your ISP has its own policy set in place
2010-03-18T05:41:00.000Z	madjoe	Gnea	it's my ISP then... arrrgh!
2010-03-18T05:42:00.000Z	Gnea	madjoe	well, that's not necessarily a bad thing. http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/ is a good site
2010-03-25T14:18:00.000Z	Gnea	madjoe	there are symbolic links, but it's not like windows where it's just a file, it's an actual link, so you're pwd would reflect either location
2010-03-25T14:22:00.000Z	Gnea	madjoe	try it?
2010-03-25T14:24:00.000Z	madjoe	Gnea	yes, I've tried it, but it won't work
