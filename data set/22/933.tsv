2011-01-09T08:34:00.000Z	r00t4rd3d	Larriv	sometimes with laptops the brightness gets turned down all the way too , check your fn-brightness key
2011-01-09T08:37:00.000Z	r00t4rd3d	Larriv	have you checked your bios settings ? Also make sure you set your resolution low , you may have it set to high for your monitor but okay for your tv
2011-01-09T08:39:00.000Z	r00t4rd3d	Larriv	I would check the bios settings for primary video output
2011-01-09T08:40:00.000Z	r00t4rd3d	Larriv	hey is there a FN-ket on your laptop to switch from monitor to vga output ?
