2005-09-20T13:17:00.000Z	hoodman		what about networking a winXP computer with a Ubuntu computer?
2005-09-20T13:18:00.000Z	dcraven	hoodman	Linux can network with anything.
2005-09-20T13:19:00.000Z	dcraven	hoodman	My opinion is that you should not count on your Windows applications to work, generally.
2005-09-20T13:20:00.000Z	dcraven	hoodman	No need for av software for Linux just yet, but something like ClamAV will filter windows viruses from emails and such.
2005-09-20T13:21:00.000Z	dcraven	hoodman	No Windows only software will work with Linux without a compatibility layer like wine. www.winehq.org will give more details if you like I think.
2005-09-20T13:22:00.000Z	dcraven	hoodman	If you are serious about the switch, I'd suggest searching for Linux alternatives for your software if possible.
2005-09-20T13:27:00.000Z	dcraven	hoodman	www.google.com/linux is a good resource.
2005-09-20T13:40:00.000Z	dcraven	hoodman	Did you download a .iso file?
2005-09-20T13:41:00.000Z	dcraven	hoodman	I know nothing of "winrar".
2005-09-20T13:42:00.000Z	hoodman	dcraven	its a compression program
2005-09-20T13:43:00.000Z	dcraven	hoodman	If it's a .iso file, you can just write it to a CD. Windows can do it through a context menu can it not?
2005-09-20T13:43:00.000Z	dcraven	hoodman	Or "nero"
2005-09-20T13:44:00.000Z	dcraven	hoodman	Just make sure you don't just copy the ISO to a CD though.. You need to burn the image.
2005-09-20T13:44:00.000Z	dcraven	hoodman	Cool. Good luck with it :)
2005-09-20T13:45:00.000Z	hoodman	dcraven	im hoping it works well, i have an extra computer and am hoping to use it for storage and downloading
2005-09-20T13:45:00.000Z	dcraven	hoodman	And don't bother trying to run Windows .exe files on it, they won't work :P
