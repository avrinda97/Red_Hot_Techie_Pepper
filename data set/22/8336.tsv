2007-02-13T16:36:00.000Z	geeksauce	erUSUL	 not working... just throwing mad errors.
2007-02-13T16:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	geeksauce	i'm sure the package has some readme or install file explaining how to build the thing
2007-02-13T16:38:00.000Z	geeksauce	erUSUL	heh, i wish it did.  the readme contains useless info like how to use the program AFTER it's been compiled.  no install file at all.
2007-02-13T16:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	geeksauce	here http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/download_files.htm they recomend using samba over ccxserver...
2007-02-13T16:43:00.000Z	geeksauce	erUSUL	i know, but i prefer a dedicated app to stream video, so only my xbox can see the shared media
2007-02-13T16:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	geeksauce	a simple "make" build everythimg for me
2007-02-13T16:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	geeksauce	most likely you lack *-dev packages try installing the basic build-essential and then libc6-dev....
2007-02-13T17:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	geeksauce	no problem ;)
2007-02-13T17:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	geeksauce	you need libreadline-dev
2007-02-13T17:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	geeksauce	please use tab completion of my nick i almost missed the last msg
2007-02-13T17:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	geeksauce	well most irc clients can complete the nicks hitting <tab> as bash do with commands and filenames
2007-02-13T17:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	geeksauce	 i only type ge<tab> and your nick is completed for me... ;)
2007-02-13T17:19:00.000Z	geeksauce	erUSUL	thanks :)  works fine now
2007-03-07T15:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	geeksauce	have you enabled multiverse?
2007-03-07T15:49:00.000Z	geeksauce	erUSUL	all repos enabled

2007-03-07T15:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	geeksauce	in edgy you hace sun-java5-jre the 6 version is only in backports... have you enabled backports...
2007-03-07T15:56:00.000Z	geeksauce	erUSUL	i thought i enabled all repos, but i will double-check
2007-03-07T15:59:00.000Z	geeksauce	erUSUL	heh, i had all repos enabled except that and proposed updates.  i'll try again.  ultimately i'm trying to get frostwire to work.
2007-03-07T15:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	geeksauce	the 6 version is in backports
