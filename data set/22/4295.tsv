2009-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	LetsGo67		Copy protection?
2009-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	LetsGo67		No way around it?  Why is it so much trickier than CD and VHS?
2009-01-01T04:39:00.000Z	LetsGo67		I am trying to put my dvds on Nintendo DS... if possible.  And I only have a 4gb card.
2009-01-01T04:39:00.000Z	LetsGo67		But ARccOS is sony, not Disney...
2009-01-01T04:40:00.000Z	LetsGo67		Weternal, but I only need it at the native DS resolution, right?
2009-01-01T04:41:00.000Z	LetsGo67		Should I give up dvd::rip?  Yeah, Wall-E is protected, afaik
2009-01-01T04:41:00.000Z	LetsGo67		Thanks.
2009-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	LetsGo67		:)
2009-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	LetsGo67		Yeah copy protected logo on it, by the way.
2009-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	LetsGo67		Isn't it close to the gba's?
2009-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	rww	LetsGo67	Really? Damnit, I just bought that DVD for someone the other day and didn't see it. Stupid sneaky DRM >.>
2009-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	rww	LetsGo67	no
2010-04-18T05:45:00.000Z	rww	LetsGo67	no need for the caps and repetition, thanks
2010-04-18T05:45:00.000Z	LetsGo67	rww	But why isn't there an easy fix?
2010-04-18T05:46:00.000Z	rww	LetsGo67	I don't know, but allcaps isn't going to encourage people to help you.
2010-04-18T05:48:00.000Z	LetsGo67	rww	How do I downgrade to 8.10?
2010-04-18T05:48:00.000Z	rww	LetsGo67	I don't know, and it's a really bad idea anyway.
2010-04-18T05:49:00.000Z	LetsGo67	rww	How do I use an older kernel?
2010-04-18T05:49:00.000Z	rww	LetsGo67	There are unofficial kernel packages at http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
2010-04-18T05:50:00.000Z	rww	LetsGo67	incidentally, Ubuntu 8.10 reaches end-of-life status at the end of this month, so using it now is probably a bad idea.
2010-04-18T05:51:00.000Z	LetsGo67	rww	Okay, the 8.10 kernel, can I use it in current release?
2010-04-18T05:51:00.000Z	rww	LetsGo67	If you'd like, but as I said, it's unofficial so if you have problems with it, you get to keep both pieces.
