2007-04-27T12:50:00.000Z	extaskara	MajorApus	what wireless device do you have?
2007-04-27T12:51:00.000Z	MajorApus	extaskara	i dont have wireless, why would you assume that?
2007-04-27T12:51:00.000Z	extaskara	MajorApus	because I miss read your question lol ;)
2007-04-27T12:51:00.000Z	extaskara	MajorApus	what nic do u have?
2007-04-27T12:51:00.000Z	MajorApus	extaskara	isn't there a command i can type to see the driver its using
2007-04-27T12:52:00.000Z	extaskara	MajorApus	ahh not that I know of. you can use `lspci |grep -i net` to see the device, then lsmod to see what modules are loaded
2007-04-27T12:53:00.000Z	MajorApus	extaskara	where could I find out what driver its using?
2007-04-27T12:53:00.000Z	MajorApus	extaskara	Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168B PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller (rev 01)
2007-04-27T12:56:00.000Z	extaskara	MajorApus	ok, so you have a realtek device.. is it usb or pci?
2007-04-27T12:56:00.000Z	MajorApus	extaskara	onboard
2007-04-27T12:57:00.000Z	MajorApus	extaskara	and you do realize you just asked if a gigabit network card was usb
2007-04-27T13:01:00.000Z	extaskara	MajorApus	ahh yes, indeed I did :) can you see if you have r8169 loaded?
2007-04-27T13:01:00.000Z	MajorApus	extaskara	how?
2007-04-27T13:02:00.000Z	MajorApus	extaskara	I had to run and check to make sure usb 2.0 wasn't gigabit, that would have been embarassing
2007-04-27T13:02:00.000Z	extaskara	MajorApus	 nope, it's 480MBit ;)
2007-04-27T13:05:00.000Z	MajorApus	extaskara	how do I see if I have r8169 loaded?
2007-04-27T13:05:00.000Z	extaskara	MajorApus	oh, I already posted that.. run: `lsmod |grep r8169`
2007-04-27T13:06:00.000Z	MajorApus	extaskara	it responsds "r8169                  32392  0"
2007-04-27T13:06:00.000Z	extaskara	MajorApus	good, that's what you're using
2007-04-27T13:06:00.000Z	MajorApus	extaskara	okay, its not one in the tutorial im looking at, so ... how do I tell it to enable WOL
2007-04-27T13:06:00.000Z	extaskara	MajorApus	I don't know a command to print what device is using what module, but any module that is loaded is used by your system
2007-04-27T13:07:00.000Z	extaskara	MajorApus	absolutely no idea ;) in your bios maybe?
