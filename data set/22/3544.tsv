2009-05-13T07:59:00.000Z	Gnea	weternal	it's your system, you tell me - open a terminal and type:  lspci | grep VGA
2009-05-13T08:00:00.000Z	weternal		gnea yeah here's the response from the vga line of lspci: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon RV250 [Mobility FireGL 9000] (rev 02)
2009-05-13T08:00:00.000Z	Gnea	weternal	so you've got a laptop?

2009-05-13T08:00:00.000Z	Gnea		!laptop
2009-05-13T08:02:00.000Z	Gnea	weternal	hard to say, not sure if it'll do an external monitor at the same time.. does it work in windows?
2009-05-13T08:03:00.000Z	weternal		gnea, yes It did work in xp... however since then I have lost the XP partition
2009-05-13T08:04:00.000Z	weternal	Gnea	I'm trying to get it to output video through an s-video cable
2009-05-13T08:06:00.000Z	Gnea	weternal	you can't do dual-monitors using s-video
2009-05-13T08:06:00.000Z	Gnea	weternal	it would have to be vga or dvi
2009-05-13T08:07:00.000Z	weternal		gnea thanks for the help
2009-05-13T08:07:00.000Z	Gnea	weternal	do you have the aticonfig tool installed?
2009-05-13T08:07:00.000Z	weternal		gnea no
2009-05-13T08:08:00.000Z	weternal		gnea what's the package name for aticonfig?
2009-05-13T08:09:00.000Z	Gnea	weternal	iirc, it comes with the fglrx drivers
