2006-12-08T13:47:00.000Z	belfegorash		when i switch user and try to login with root ...the password said that is invalid why?
2006-12-08T13:49:00.000Z	vonguard	belfegorash	because ubuntu does not like it when you login as root
2006-12-08T13:49:00.000Z	vonguard	belfegorash	it prefers you to login as user, then sudo -s
2006-12-08T14:00:00.000Z	vonguard	belfegorash	it should handle it, but for advanced graphics cards, like new nvidias, you have to install the company's version
2006-12-08T14:00:00.000Z	vonguard	belfegorash	that card is very underpowered, it may not do even the simplest things
