2005-06-05T09:05:00.000Z	delire	Amaranth	would be nice.
2005-06-05T09:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	delire	they don't make g4 cubes anymore
2005-06-05T09:06:00.000Z	delire	Amaranth	oh..
2005-06-05T09:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	delire	those things were awesome, but they were really meant for OS X
2005-06-05T09:07:00.000Z	Amaranth	delire	running them with OS 9 is frustrating
2005-06-05T09:07:00.000Z	delire	Amaranth	i think the powerbooks are pretty horribly made however. sort of 'tinny' and the keyboards feel a bit cheap. the towers and cubes are quite appealing however.
2005-06-11T11:35:00.000Z	Amaranth	delire	You enjoy recompiling the driver on every kernel update?
2005-06-11T11:36:00.000Z	delire	Amaranth	i have a script that compiles all third-party drivers for me
2005-06-11T11:36:00.000Z	delire	Amaranth	and anyway, i upgrade my kernel every 6 months
2005-06-11T12:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	delire	No, mesa packages make up the base of OpenGL support in X.
2005-06-11T12:42:00.000Z	delire	Amaranth	and it's loaded.
2005-06-11T12:43:00.000Z	delire	Amaranth	we compiled and installed the proprietary ati drivers
2005-06-11T12:43:00.000Z	delire	Amaranth	they don't offer pixel and vertex shaders
2005-06-11T12:44:00.000Z	delire	Amaranth	that's his problem.
2005-06-11T12:44:00.000Z	delire	Amaranth	he needs GLSL support for his games
2005-06-11T12:45:00.000Z	delire	Amaranth	others have had the same problem with 'rubies'
2005-06-11T12:46:00.000Z	delire	Amaranth	sigh. why should he? the ati way works. i've helped two or three dozen this way here.
2005-07-22T16:05:00.000Z	delire	Amaranth	no http://elastico.net/copyfight.
2005-07-27T15:50:00.000Z	delire	Amaranth	ouch.
