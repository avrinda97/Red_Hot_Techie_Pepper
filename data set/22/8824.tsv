2005-08-05T06:40:00.000Z	xie		What file system should it be using, maybe somehow it's selecting the wrong one?
2005-08-05T06:41:00.000Z	xie		It was trying Ext3 and locking up.
2005-08-05T06:41:00.000Z	xie		I dont know just to get it working I'll try FAT or something
2005-08-05T06:41:00.000Z	xie		once I get it working I can do a little more
2005-08-05T06:41:00.000Z	xie		O

2005-08-05T06:42:00.000Z	xie		I'm starting to get a little bit frustrated though, everyone told me that Ubuntu just "works"
2005-08-05T06:42:00.000Z	xie		Oh it could be the RAM you say?

2005-08-05T06:44:00.000Z	Razor-X	xie	how old is this machine?
2005-08-05T06:44:00.000Z	Razor-X	xie	what version of Windows do you run?
2005-08-05T06:45:00.000Z	Razor-X	xie	now, what does it run?
2005-08-05T06:45:00.000Z	Razor-X	xie	you're saying that Ubuntu will setup on a machine that Windows 95 used?
2005-08-05T07:06:00.000Z	Razor-X	xie	meh
2005-08-05T07:17:00.000Z	Razor-X	xie	depends if your modem is supported
2005-08-05T07:18:00.000Z	Razor-X	xie	or any other memory intensive thing
