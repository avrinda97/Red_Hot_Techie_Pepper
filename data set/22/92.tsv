2012-09-11T04:54:00.000Z	ring2	switchblade	but i don't know, if it'll play bluerays with some fancy copy-protection
2012-09-11T04:59:00.000Z	ring2	switchblade	if you encouter non-working bluerays, you probably have to fiddle some more. here is a good start: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/BluRayAndHDDVD
