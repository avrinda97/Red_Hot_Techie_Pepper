2012-11-17T23:21:00.000Z	shakaponk		hey guyz, when i download and burn the iso image on dvd it is not bootable (and yes, i know how to burn an iso image :-) ) but the iso contains wubi and autostart refers to it...
2012-11-17T23:22:00.000Z	shakaponk		i need an image without wubi... just a regular bootable install dvd
2012-11-17T23:22:00.000Z	L3top	shakaponk	what version are you downloading and what medium?
2012-11-17T23:23:00.000Z	shakaponk	L3top	current 12.10 or 12.04
2012-11-17T23:24:00.000Z	L3top	shakaponk	which one? I believe 12.10 is like 800 megs and wont burn to a normal cd. And check the md5sum
2012-11-17T23:24:00.000Z	shakaponk	L3top	yes, both of them... and isnt it possible to burn it on dvd?
2012-11-17T23:25:00.000Z	L3top	shakaponk	this is the point of my question as to medium, but you did not answer, so I was just throwing out possibilities...
2012-11-17T23:26:00.000Z	shakaponk	L3top	downloaded both, both are bigger than a cd, so i burned it on a dvd
2012-11-17T23:27:00.000Z	L3top	shakaponk	try using a usb thumbdrive. It is faster without medium problems.
2012-11-17T23:28:00.000Z	shakaponk	L3top	??? :-)
2012-11-17T23:29:00.000Z	shakaponk	L3top	ubottu: i guess i have to try, but why is wubi in the damn iso? i don't want an wubi edition
2012-11-17T23:29:00.000Z	shakaponk	L3top	i already got one and just trying to increas the disk size, and the guide says i need a livecd
2012-11-17T23:33:00.000Z	L3top	shakaponk	what are you on now
2012-11-17T23:34:00.000Z	shakaponk	L3top	i got a wubi installation on a special partition, and ubuntu complains that there is not enough space
2012-11-17T23:34:00.000Z	shakaponk	L3top	and dev/loop i guess is 98% full, i've found out that the virtual disk is full and i have to increase it... followed the guide on ubuntu to increase the disk size
2012-11-17T23:35:00.000Z	shakaponk	L3top	there is said that i need a livecd to increase it, the wubi disk duplicate is not an option
2012-11-17T23:35:00.000Z	L3top	shakaponk	Or use windows to create the thumb. Its in the guide.
2012-11-17T23:36:00.000Z	shakaponk	L3top	what is it? haven't heard of it
2012-11-17T23:38:00.000Z	shakaponk	L3top	in which way would it help me solve my problem?
2012-11-17T23:39:00.000Z	L3top	shakaponk	it would allow you to create a "live cd" on a USB drive, which you would then boot to... just as if it were a CD.
2012-11-17T23:39:00.000Z	shakaponk	L3top	ok, thx for your input... i'll give it a try
2012-11-17T23:40:00.000Z	L3top	shakaponk	from which point you can do a dual install...
