2009-03-20T07:12:00.000Z	imachine	cj_sze1	64bit
2009-03-20T07:12:00.000Z	cj_sze1	imachine	i need a 64 bit proccesor??
2009-03-20T07:15:00.000Z	imachine	cj_sze1	ubuntu 64bit and yes, a 64bit cpu.
2009-03-20T07:15:00.000Z	imachine		system overall.
2009-03-20T07:15:00.000Z	imachine		I think you can get it to see more than 4GB with 32bit with some hackish way, but a single process won't be able to address more than 2GB, or something along those lines.
2009-03-20T07:15:00.000Z	imachine	cj_sze1	anyway, 64bit is pretty much standard these days isn't it?
2009-03-20T07:16:00.000Z	cj_sze1	imachine	yes... and most CPU are also 64 bit ready
2009-03-20T07:17:00.000Z	cj_sze1		i both core 2 duo E7400  imachine
2009-03-20T07:17:00.000Z	cj_sze1		and 4 G of ram imachine
2009-03-20T07:19:00.000Z	cj_sze1		btw imachine how can i find a 64 bit ubuntu server?
2009-03-20T07:19:00.000Z	imachine	cj_sze1	amd64
2009-03-20T07:19:00.000Z	imachine	cj_sze1	x86_64
2009-03-20T07:19:00.000Z	imachine		dunno

2009-03-20T07:20:00.000Z	cj_sze1		how about intel 64 bit? ubottu
2009-03-20T07:21:00.000Z	imachine	cj_sze1	intel uses amd64/emt64
2009-03-20T07:21:00.000Z	imachine	cj_sze1	unless you have the obscure ia64 setup. which, according to what you said earlier, you don't.
