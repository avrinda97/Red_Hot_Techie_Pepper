2006-05-27T14:19:00.000Z	sybariten		ok i have a problem with a program that wont install over apt ... and even if this may boil down to me having a too old PPC version, i still dont understand why it cant get a library in. The tool seems to rely on libgda2-common, but when i try to install that apt says "its already the latest version"
2006-05-27T14:19:00.000Z	sybariten		is this a common apt problem?
2006-05-27T14:19:00.000Z	sybariten		i mean, when it seems as you need a package, but it also seems as you have it
2006-05-27T14:21:00.000Z	bimberi	sybariten	the program probabaly wants a later version which isn't currently available in your repositories
2006-05-27T14:21:00.000Z	sybariten	bimberi	but apt says libgda2-common is already the latest version? (on my machine)
2006-05-27T14:24:00.000Z	bimberi	sybariten	exactly, so what's the exact command error message when you try to install your program (use pastebin)
2006-05-27T14:29:00.000Z	sybariten	bimberi	http://pastebin.ca/58461   Read from the top and down (as is usual in the western countries)
2006-05-27T14:30:00.000Z	bimberi	sybariten	ok, looking, thanks for the tip :)
2006-05-27T14:33:00.000Z	bimberi	sybariten	pastebin your sources.list and the output from 'apt-cache policy libgda2-common'
2006-05-27T14:34:00.000Z	sybariten	bimberi	"policy" ? Uh ok whatever you say ....
2006-05-27T14:35:00.000Z	bimberi	sybariten	i am trying to help here.  have i annoyed you in some way?
2006-05-27T14:36:00.000Z	sybariten	bimberi	no, its just that apt-cache surprises me with its many weird options
2006-05-27T14:37:00.000Z	bimberi	sybariten	ah, kk :)
2006-05-27T14:38:00.000Z	sybariten	bimberi	okay lets see, i put them in the same paste:   http://pastebin.ca/58466   the sources come first.
2006-05-27T14:43:00.000Z	bimberi	sybariten	that is wierd, have you done a "sudo apt-get update" recently?
2006-05-27T14:44:00.000Z	sybariten	bimberi	yeah, i believe i did that just after commenting out some stuff in the sources 15 minutes ago ... but i could try again
2006-05-27T14:45:00.000Z	sybariten	bimberi	btw someone said that "ubuntu0.1" looked fishy
2006-05-27T14:47:00.000Z	bimberi	sybariten	no that's ok, although i thought it was supposed to be ubuntu1, ubuntu2 ...
2006-05-27T14:50:00.000Z	sybariten	bimberi	ok ....
2006-05-27T14:51:00.000Z	sybariten	bimberi	but is the weird thing that it doesnt want to install libgda2-common (or that it complains that it needs it, when at the same time it says it has it) .... or did you see anything else that was weird too ?
2006-05-27T14:53:00.000Z	bimberi	sybariten	yes, the wierd thing is that it says it says "Depends: libgda2-common (>= 1.1.99-1ubuntu0.1)" and yet you have "1.2.1-2ubuntu2~hoary1" installed
2006-05-27T15:09:00.000Z	sybariten	bimberi	OK ... thanks for taking a look at it!
