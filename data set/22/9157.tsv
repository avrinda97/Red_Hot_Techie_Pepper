2005-04-09T12:41:00.000Z	mxpxpod		how do I keep a partition from mounting when ubuntu starts up?
2005-04-09T12:41:00.000Z	mxpxpod		my macosx partition wants to mount every boot
2005-04-09T12:42:00.000Z	lunitik	mxpxpod	take it out of fstab?
2005-04-09T12:43:00.000Z	lunitik	mxpxpod	via mount?
2005-04-09T12:43:00.000Z	mxpxpod	lunitik	and Xappe: shouldn't there be an option to not mount certain partitions?  usually noauto does this, but it's not working
2005-04-09T12:44:00.000Z	lunitik	mxpxpod	fstab is for mounting things at boot...
2005-04-09T12:44:00.000Z	mxpxpod	lunitik	right
2005-04-09T12:44:00.000Z	lunitik	mxpxpod	if you don't want that... you don't want it in fstab
2005-04-09T12:45:00.000Z	mxpxpod	lunitik	what? no, fstab is to describe your file systems
2005-04-09T12:45:00.000Z	lunitik	mxpxpod	you could do something like 'alias osx='mount -t hfs /dev/wherever /wherever -o whatever' though
2005-04-09T12:45:00.000Z	lunitik	mxpxpod	still fast...
2005-04-09T12:45:00.000Z	lunitik	mxpxpod	umm, no
2005-04-09T12:45:00.000Z	lunitik	mxpxpod	its for mounting things at boot.
2005-04-09T12:45:00.000Z	mxpxpod	lunitik	from the fstab man page:
2005-04-09T12:47:00.000Z	mxpxpod	lunitik	so, what that's saying is that if I put noauto as an option for a fs in fstab, it shouldn't mount
2005-04-09T12:47:00.000Z	lunitik	mxpxpod	ok... then do it  :/
2005-04-09T12:48:00.000Z	mxpxpod	lunitik	also, if fstab is only for boot, how would you set permissions for non-root users to open cdroms?
2005-04-09T12:49:00.000Z	lunitik	mxpxpod	you already figured out how yourself...
2005-04-09T12:50:00.000Z	mxpxpod	lunitik	I already have that option and it doesn't work
2005-04-09T12:50:00.000Z	lunitik	mxpxpod	there goes that theory then huh?
2005-04-09T12:50:00.000Z	lunitik	mxpxpod	thanks for arguing with me... pleasure
2005-04-09T12:52:00.000Z	lunitik	mxpxpod	*shrug*    alias osx='mount -t hfsplus -o defaults,users,noauto,rw /dev/hda7 /mnt/macosx'
