2010-06-25T16:01:00.000Z	e-DIO-t		hi there: got a problem on mounting an nfs partition on boot. the fstab file works [proof giving mount -a], but on boot it doesn't want to work. Any idea?!
2010-06-25T16:02:00.000Z	X3	e-DIO-t	as long as both the server and client are configured ok NFS should mount at each boot
2010-06-25T16:03:00.000Z	X3	e-DIO-t	make sure that the dirs that NFS is trying to mount exist
2010-06-25T16:05:00.000Z	e-DIO-t	X3	folder exists and got "root" owner.
2010-06-25T16:05:00.000Z	X3	e-DIO-t	wild guess the user is always root?
2010-06-25T16:05:00.000Z	X3	e-DIO-t	try chmod those dirs as 755 or 777
2010-06-25T16:06:00.000Z	e-DIO-t	X3	using "sudo mount -a" the file works
2010-06-25T16:08:00.000Z	X3	e-DIO-t	chmod the NFS dirs your trying to mount to 755 or 777 you resove problem
2010-06-25T16:08:00.000Z	e-DIO-t	X3	is a DB-schema backup folder ;)
2010-06-25T16:09:00.000Z	X3	e-DIO-t	Like I said atm your permissions dont allow it hence you need sudo
2010-06-25T16:09:00.000Z	X3	e-DIO-t	change the permissions and sudo is not required anymore and can be ounted at startup
2010-06-25T16:10:00.000Z	X3	e-DIO-t	no fstab is executed by user
2010-06-25T16:11:00.000Z	X3	e-DIO-t	whatever you do the folders NFS mounts have to have 755 or 777 permissions
2010-06-25T16:28:00.000Z	X3	e-DIO-t	the solution I said it 3 times already the NFS mounts dirs on system your trying to mount HAVE to have 775 or 777 permissions
2010-06-25T16:32:00.000Z	e-DIO-t	X3	:P but i can't get WHY :)
2010-06-25T16:33:00.000Z	X3	e-DIO-t	if the NFS dirs dont have read and write permission onboot they will not mount since the system is not logged automatically to root
2010-06-25T16:37:00.000Z	X3	e-DIO-t	idk about your other setup double check it and emulate every condition write permissions must be allowed for a nfs dir to mount otherwise use some fakeroot option but idk about that
2010-06-25T16:40:00.000Z	e-DIO-t	X3	the two's are already the same. Same OS, same filesystem, same fstab, same mount versions, even same subnet. Same rights on remote nfs, same rights and same user on mount destination.
2010-06-25T16:52:00.000Z	X3	e-DIO-t	my nfs has these nfs rw,hard,intr 0 0
2010-06-25T16:55:00.000Z	X3	e-DIO-t	on that machine pls try the permissions I mentioned just to test
2010-06-25T16:55:00.000Z	e-DIO-t	X3	rebooting to take a look
2010-06-25T17:00:00.000Z	e-DIO-t	X3	even with 777 it won't mount!
