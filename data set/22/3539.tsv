2008-08-19T10:04:00.000Z	ph33rz	carandraug	I opened it through terminal using sudo
2008-08-19T10:04:00.000Z	carandraug	ph33rz	go to the end of the file. Sometimes there's already a default one for windows that you'll need only to uncomment
2008-08-19T10:05:00.000Z	ph33rz		yea mine doesnt have the windows i had deleted the old harddrive that had the bootloader on it and .. my windows drive still contains my windows

2008-08-19T10:06:00.000Z	ph33rz		does it being 64 bit windows effect ne thing?
2008-08-19T10:07:00.000Z	carandraug	ph33rz	http://pastebin.com/d39348431  <-- I believe these lines should do the tric. Don't know about 64bits though
2008-08-19T10:07:00.000Z	ph33rz		bob how do i go abnout finding that out?
2008-08-19T10:07:00.000Z	ph33rz		i believe its sdb1
2008-08-19T10:07:00.000Z	ph33rz		would it be an hdb1 or something format?
2008-08-19T10:09:00.000Z	carandraug	ph33rz	GRUB starts counting from zero. So, the b1 turns 1,0 in the boot option in the menu.lts
2008-08-19T10:10:00.000Z	carandraug	ph33rz	for example, a2 turns 0,1  c6 turns 2,5 and so one. You see the pattern?
