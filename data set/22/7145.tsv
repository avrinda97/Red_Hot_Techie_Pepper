2006-06-03T14:58:00.000Z	LogicalDash		My Broadcom wireless card is working in ndiswrapper, but iwconfig keeps telling me that the access point is "invalid". What can I do to solve this?
2006-06-03T14:58:00.000Z	SurfnKid	LogicalDash	is the Mode set to Managed or Master?
2006-06-03T14:59:00.000Z	LogicalDash	SurfnKid	I've tried both, same problem.
2006-06-03T14:59:00.000Z	SurfnKid	LogicalDash	um, with NetMgr too? I used Wifi Radar to change Mode, tho that wasnt needed it just picked up the Router
2006-06-03T15:00:00.000Z	LogicalDash	SurfnKid	I'm using iwconfig, I'm not sure what NetMgr is.
2006-06-03T15:01:00.000Z	SurfnKid	LogicalDash	System - Administration - Networking
2006-06-03T15:06:00.000Z	SurfnKid	LogicalDash	what u mean
2006-06-03T15:07:00.000Z	LogicalDash	SurfnKid	I go into network-admin and activate eth1 (wireless), then I hit OK, then I go back in and it's deactivated again for no reason.
