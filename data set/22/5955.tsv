2007-02-03T16:37:00.000Z	Chousuke		just about any player should, I think
2007-02-03T16:39:00.000Z	Chousuke		take a look at those pages listed in the sound factoid.
2007-02-03T16:39:00.000Z	Chousuke		wow, lots of people having trouble with sound.
2007-02-03T16:35:00.000Z	Chousuke		hmm
2007-02-03T16:36:00.000Z	Chousuke		${group} might be better
2007-02-03T16:36:00.000Z	Chousuke		also, that will only echo the commands
2007-02-03T16:36:00.000Z	Chousuke		make sure it's correct and remove the exho
2007-02-03T16:36:00.000Z	Chousuke		echo*
2007-02-03T16:38:00.000Z	Chousuke		hm
2007-02-03T16:38:00.000Z	Chousuke		except it seems that for isn't working properly
2007-02-03T16:40:00.000Z	unop	Chousuke	 that's because you quoted the groups when you shouldnt have
2007-02-03T16:40:00.000Z	Chousuke	unop	hmm :p
2008-04-11T13:45:00.000Z	Chousuke	unop	that's a bad command.
2008-04-11T13:45:00.000Z	unop	Chousuke	no it's not
2008-04-11T13:45:00.000Z	Chousuke	unop	it'll remove you from any group you're in that you don't list.
2008-04-11T13:46:00.000Z	unop	Chousuke	i dont remember that ever being the case before
2008-04-11T13:46:00.000Z	Chousuke	unop	the manual page says so
2008-04-11T13:46:00.000Z	Chousuke	unop	you want usermod -aG
2008-04-11T13:49:00.000Z	unop	Chousuke	assuming i have the same manpage you do, -G does not say anything about removing the user from the groups he currently exists in but it does say "  A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of "
2008-04-11T13:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	unop	"If the user  is currently a member of a group which is not listed, the user will be removed from the group."
2009-06-05T04:39:00.000Z	unop	Chousuke	somehow *is* doesn't work too well there
2009-06-05T04:39:00.000Z	Chousuke	unop	might be.
