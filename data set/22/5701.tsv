2008-01-13T11:21:00.000Z	proqesi	thinman1189	you need to install it with aptitude, you may have the wrong version
2008-01-13T11:21:00.000Z	thinman1189	proqesi	: I'm following the instructions found here : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AMD64/FirefoxAndPlugins
2008-01-13T11:23:00.000Z	proqesi	thinman1189	in my experience that is pretty hard. you may need to do a lot of troubleshooting. flock installed easily for me
2008-01-13T11:24:00.000Z	thinman1189	proqesi	: well this isn't the only time I haven't been able to extract a tar file. I can't extract any, and I always get the same error message. I'm probably just doing something wrong.
2008-01-13T11:24:00.000Z	proqesi	thinman1189	tar -xvzf?
2008-01-13T11:25:00.000Z	thinman1189	proqesi	: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/51743/
2008-01-13T11:26:00.000Z	thinman1189	proqesi	:  from the command: tar -zxf firefox-2.0.0.7.tar.gz
2008-01-13T11:26:00.000Z	proqesi	thinman1189	try what I showed you
2008-01-13T11:27:00.000Z	proqesi	thinman1189	you need -xvf for .tar, -xzvf for tar.gz, and -xjf for tar.bz2
2008-01-13T11:34:00.000Z	proqesi	thinman1189	cd to where the file is. by default, that would be cd ~/Desktop
2008-01-13T11:41:00.000Z	proqesi	thinman1189	it extracts to the same directory that the archive is in
2008-01-13T11:42:00.000Z	thinman1189	proqesi	: so it should be in my home folder?
2008-01-13T11:43:00.000Z	proqesi	thinman1189	it should be on your desktop
2008-01-13T11:43:00.000Z	thinman1189	proqesi	:  it's not
2008-01-13T11:44:00.000Z	proqesi	thinman1189	you should have a firefox folder there
2008-01-13T11:45:00.000Z	thinman1189	proqesi	: I don't
2008-01-13T11:46:00.000Z	proqesi	thinman1189	what directory was the file in when you extracted it?
2008-01-13T11:47:00.000Z	thinman1189	proqesi	: here's what it extracting in terminal : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/51744/ I did in fact find a firefox folder in my home folder, says it was last modified in november. I don't remember putting it there, and I'm not sure if my extracting would have counted as a modification/that was when this version was released.
2008-01-13T11:54:00.000Z	thinman1189	proqesi	: that's the folder, but I don't know how to move it into the next folder. the next command I'm supposed to input is sudo mv firefox /usr/local/firefox32
2008-01-13T11:54:00.000Z	proqesi	thinman1189	that command should work if you are in home and firefox folder is there as you said
2008-01-13T11:56:00.000Z	thinman1189	proqesi	: the folder is in home and I get the error mv: cannot stat `firefox': No such file or directory
2008-01-13T11:57:00.000Z	thinman1189	proqesi	: using the command sudo mv firefox /usr/local/firefox32
