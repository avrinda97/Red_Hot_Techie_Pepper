2010-12-31T20:34:00.000Z	ryan_languagelab		hi. I have an intel integrated graphics card and an nvidia card. Is it possible to use both? I would prefer to use whatever card has better linux support.
2010-12-31T20:35:00.000Z	Asigottech	ryan_languagelab	NIVDIA and INTEl have good support, the Nividia (Im using one now) will be supported and prob better
2010-12-31T20:36:00.000Z	Asigottech	ryan_languagelab	no need to, it will offer to install the driver and it will install an offical cp for you
2010-12-31T20:37:00.000Z	Asigottech	ryan_languagelab	Basicly Ubuntu will ask you if you want it to donwload and install it all for you, you say yes and enter password and you is dun
2010-12-31T20:37:00.000Z	ryan_languagelab	Asigottech	 my major concern is that when i orginally installed the proprietary driver, it woudl flas "_" and not load
2010-12-31T20:38:00.000Z	Asigottech	ryan_languagelab	you do not need to install it, Ubuntu will do it for you mainly, no probs like there where a few years ago, Im using one now
2010-12-31T20:39:00.000Z	Asigottech	ryan_languagelab	if you have already installed 10.10 just goto system - prefrences - apperance and click on advanced, then click on medium and go from there
2010-12-31T20:42:00.000Z	ryan_languagelab	Asigottech	not seeing an advanced option in appearance
2010-12-31T20:44:00.000Z	Asigottech	ryan_languagelab	visual effect s sorry
2010-12-31T20:45:00.000Z	Asigottech	ryan_languagelab	just click on visual effcts then medium and the drivers search screen apears
2010-12-31T20:45:00.000Z	ryan_languagelab	Asigottech	yes it fails
2010-12-31T20:45:00.000Z	Asigottech	ryan_languagelab	it will then search and list a beta driver and a recomended driver, selct the recomended one and it does the rest
2010-12-31T20:46:00.000Z	ryan_languagelab	Asigottech	it doesn't do that... is there any other dialog i can use?
2010-12-31T20:47:00.000Z	Asigottech	ryan_languagelab	/usr/bin/jockey-gtk
2010-12-31T20:47:00.000Z	Asigottech	ryan_languagelab	sorry, from bash run /usr/bin/jockey-gtk
2010-12-31T20:48:00.000Z	ryan_languagelab	Asigottech	 the problem is it's only listing a modem
