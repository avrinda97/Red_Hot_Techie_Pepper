2009-05-24T05:46:00.000Z	VCoolio1	epicreviews	epicreviews download this deb: http://launchpad.net/gnomenu/trunk/1.9-final/+download/gnomenu_1.9.6-6_all.deb
2009-05-24T06:04:00.000Z	VCoolio1	epicreviews	find gdm-themes there
2009-05-24T06:26:00.000Z	VCoolio1	epicreviews	probably that's a config file. Install conky and run: conky -c /path/to/that/file
2009-05-24T06:26:00.000Z	VCoolio1	epicreviews	yes
2009-05-24T06:27:00.000Z	VCoolio1	epicreviews	it takes a LOT of tweaking
2009-05-24T06:32:00.000Z	VCoolio1	epicreviews	http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=3528480&postcount=788 has an example and a good config file with explanation what each option does.
2009-05-24T06:35:00.000Z	VCoolio1	epicreviews	if you run conky it will use /.conkyrc, but you can use any file with conky -c /path/to/file and like that open several conky's at a time
2009-05-24T06:37:00.000Z	VCoolio1	epicreviews	ah, I think you need a command to create a .conkyrc in your home folder
2009-05-24T06:38:00.000Z	VCoolio1	epicreviews	just copypaste one from the links we gave and name that .conkyrc and put it in home
2009-05-24T06:40:00.000Z	VCoolio1	epicreviews	that's all good except the first one
2009-05-24T06:44:00.000Z	VCoolio1	epicreviews	line 62 is a config misstype; the 2nd line is solvable by adding a correct argument like it says; the 7th line is because there is a command called that your system doesn't have. 3-6 are normal output
2009-05-24T06:46:00.000Z	VCoolio1	epicreviews	in line 62 make it "draw_shades", so add an 's'
2009-05-24T06:53:00.000Z	VCoolio1	epicreviews	somewhere under TEXT
2009-05-24T07:07:00.000Z	VCoolio1	epicreviews	that's maybe lyricsdownloader (line 87)? It's something trying to connect to internet, dunno if this uses that port by default
