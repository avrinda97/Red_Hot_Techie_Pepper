2010-12-25T10:46:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		it's easier to distinguish between uniquenick and guest####  but it's not required
2010-12-25T10:48:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		^^ u will only see wireless clients
2010-12-25T10:49:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		anything more and it's borderline against the rules of this channel
2010-12-25T10:50:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		if you're using a wireless connection while running wireshark (with no wired connection) you will ONLY SEE  other wireless connections, no wired connections...
2010-12-25T10:50:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		unless you have a program on your router that feeds you data
2010-12-25T10:51:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri	nooonickman	like i said, if you have a program installed on the router, .. you *could* do that yes, but we *should not speak* of that here
2010-12-25T10:52:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		there's other places to learn about that, that does not put us at liability
2010-12-25T10:52:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		yep ^^
2010-12-25T10:52:00.000Z	karthick87	rinku_kokiri	It was coz of the configuration i have just made recently to my .bashrc file..
