2009-11-19T19:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nerdy_kid	you can fix it old school
2009-11-19T19:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nerdy_kid	if you run: gksudo nvidia-settings         you can setup the screen someway then click "Write to X config file"
2009-11-19T19:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nerdy_kid	you can now run: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf    and fine tune the res in the file, save the new file and restart X / reboot
2009-11-19T19:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nerdy_kid	i have to use xorg.conf still as my monitor doesnt report refresh rates so I have to add them in manually
2009-11-19T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nerdy_kid	what error do you get?
2009-11-19T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nerdy_kid	is it "cannot parse xorg.conf fie"
2009-11-19T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nerdy_kid	or similar
2009-11-19T19:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nerdy_kid	yes, the res won't change until you edit the file and restart X, otherwise you just wrote the config for the system to the xorg.conf file, nothing more
2009-11-19T19:30:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ActionParsnip	yeah, i havnt edited anything yet, thanks
2009-11-19T19:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nerdy_kid	did you not set a resolution in nvidia-settings?   if you leave it as auto, you will get that. Set the resolution to something other than auto, like 1024x768 and then you can change the number easier
2009-11-19T19:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nerdy_kid	i can send yu mine if you'd like

2010-06-20T00:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nerdy_kid	partimage
2010-06-20T00:36:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ActionParsnip	thanks :) i have tried dd but it just simply does not work
2010-06-20T00:38:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ActionParsnip	um partimage ntfs support is experimental?  that wont do...
2010-06-20T00:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nerdy_kid	its free to try, if it goes bad you can always format
2010-06-20T00:40:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ActionParsnip	any other options? :-/
2010-06-20T00:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nerdy_kid	could try: dd_rescue   it will copy from source to dest and not stop on issues
2010-06-20T00:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nerdy_kid	you could ask in ##windows. See if they know anything
2010-07-25T03:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nerdy_kid	not sure, could try it, if you can work out a rollback path then you can just go for it
