2012-08-16T00:39:00.000Z	jase_		does ubuntu create logs of a shutdown or reboot
2012-08-16T00:39:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	/var/log/syslog
2012-08-16T00:42:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	let me look at a machine that recently rebooted
2012-08-16T00:57:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	sorry got side tracked let me look
2012-08-16T00:58:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	depends what you mean by shutdown messages... I rebooted a machine just now and there are messages from programs closing down etc
2012-08-16T01:00:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	prefix messages for me with agoodm to grab my attention
2012-08-16T01:01:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	i imagine itll be logging everything till very late in the shutdown process when the file system becomes read only
2012-08-16T01:03:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	what is broken?
2012-08-16T01:04:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	what exactly is broken?
2012-08-16T01:06:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	ah, really have no clue personally how to debug this, only thing i can suggest as a stab in the dark is start up with noapic or noacpi kernel parameters
2012-08-16T01:09:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	turning off apic and or acpi can help fix issues where the acpi or apic implementation is broken or buggy for your hardware
2012-08-16T01:11:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	dont add it in grub in case your system doesnt boot afterwards
2012-08-16T01:12:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	off top of my head procedure is keep tapping escape as your machine boots, in the grub menu press e then use the arrow keys to get to the end of the kernel line type noacpi then press enter or b
2012-08-16T01:12:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	try noapic and noacpi seperately first
2012-08-16T01:54:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	on the end of the kernel line
2012-08-16T01:55:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	is the - already on the line?
2012-08-16T02:17:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	is the shut down issue fixed?
2012-08-16T02:24:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	probably higher power usage and thats about it
2012-08-16T02:26:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	possibly or more like the acpi implementation for your system is buggy or incomplete
2012-08-16T02:28:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	yes
2012-08-16T02:28:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	there is stuff in ubuntu that interfaces with it too
2012-08-16T02:34:00.000Z	agoodm	jase_	erm
