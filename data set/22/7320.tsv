2006-05-27T16:54:00.000Z	OlliK		how can I add new user to the linux?
2006-05-27T16:54:00.000Z	OlliK		When i try to add user like: sudo adduser name group, it says "The user 'name' does not exist.
2006-05-27T16:55:00.000Z	OlliK		How could it exist becuase I'm just trying to create it? I don't get it
2006-05-27T16:56:00.000Z	OlliK		Does anyone know how to add a user to linux using adduser-command? I've looked from man adduser and it seems to be just like: "sudo adduser thename thegroup"
2006-05-27T16:56:00.000Z	OlliK		But for me, it says "adduser: The user 'theuser' does not exist."
2006-05-27T16:58:00.000Z	OlliK		Can anyone help me with "adduser" command?
2006-05-27T05:00:00.000Z	pvd2006	OlliK	try this
2006-05-27T05:00:00.000Z	pvd2006		sudo -s then after that just type adduser name group etc...
2006-05-27T05:03:00.000Z	pvd2006		whats the command to remove a user again in linux?
2006-05-27T05:03:00.000Z	OlliK	pvd2006	what does sudo -s do?
2006-05-27T05:04:00.000Z	pvd2006		sudo-s takes you to root logon then you can type commands as root.
2006-05-27T05:04:00.000Z	pvd2006		then you can exit it out
2006-05-27T05:04:00.000Z	OlliK	pvd2006	ok, thanks
2006-05-27T05:04:00.000Z	pvd2006		np;)
2006-05-27T05:04:00.000Z	OlliK	pvd2006	it still says the same
2006-05-27T05:05:00.000Z	OlliK	pvd2006	adduser: The user 'myuser' does not exist.
2006-05-27T05:05:00.000Z	pvd2006		ollik, what exactly did you type?
2006-05-27T05:05:00.000Z	OlliK	pvd2006	adduser myuser mygroup
2006-05-27T05:05:00.000Z	OlliK	pvd2006	and that mygroup exists
2006-05-27T05:06:00.000Z	pvd2006		Ollik and this is after you typed sudo -s and then went to the root prompt right
2006-05-27T05:06:00.000Z	OlliK	pvd2006	yes
2006-05-27T05:06:00.000Z	OlliK	pvd2006	before doing sudo -s, it gave the same answer when I typed: sudo adduser myuser mygroup
