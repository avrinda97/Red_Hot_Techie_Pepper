2004-12-09T09:15:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	i think its called network neighbourhood in windows
2004-12-09T09:15:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	you need to make sure than the dir is writable
2004-12-09T09:16:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	is it not supposed to>?
2004-12-09T09:17:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	if you odnt want a password  you have to change the security mode
2004-12-09T09:20:00.000Z	wood1	Slackman	I still can't connect to my Ubuntu PC from Windows Network ?
2004-12-09T09:22:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	k well i'll help you if you can give me some more info :)
2004-12-09T09:22:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	otherwise i can't help because i have no idea what your seeing/ what you've done
2004-12-09T09:23:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	also ogra seems to think that your missing something out of the wikki by the looks of it so ther is a 90% chance you haven't quite read/followed the wikki properly
2004-12-09T09:24:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	and remember you have to restart smdb and nmdb every time you change the smb.conf
2004-12-09T09:27:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	what are you using to connect,...win98 or 2k?
2004-12-09T09:28:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	ah....there's your issue
2004-12-09T09:28:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	your trying to use 2k auth when your only running 98
2004-12-09T09:29:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	did you see my post above
2004-12-09T09:30:00.000Z	wood1	Slackman	I don't understand using my Win2K authority thing ?
2004-12-09T09:31:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	look very closely i said "you have to have either no password OR your 98 username must be the same as your linux smb one"
2004-12-09T09:32:00.000Z	wood1	Slackman	I got it thanks
2004-12-09T09:33:00.000Z	wood1	Slackman	do you have any ideas why I can't browse my Network from my other PC running on Ubuntu Hoary ?
2004-12-09T09:34:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	well depends what error you get :)
2004-12-09T09:35:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	check the permissions on the dirs otherwise it may be the problem ogra was describing
2004-12-09T09:39:00.000Z	Slackman	wood1	its prolly the hoary bug then...the price you pay for unstable software i guess
