2007-12-31T10:25:00.000Z	lindzeyn		I am so infuriated w/ getting ubuntu to run on a RAID 0
2007-12-31T10:26:00.000Z	[gquit]bombadil	lindzeyn	is it a sata raid0?
2007-12-31T10:26:00.000Z	lindzeyn		Yes
2007-12-31T10:26:00.000Z	[gquit]bombadil	lindzeyn	you'll need to get the alternate install because you're installing to a sataraid or a fakeraid
2007-12-31T10:27:00.000Z	lindzeyn		I have that disc, it is also known as the text-based install correct?
2007-12-31T10:27:00.000Z	[gquit]bombadil	lindzeyn	yes
2007-12-31T10:28:00.000Z	lindzeyn		I've attempted to use that as well and have achieved no success, but I will focus my googling efforts w/ this alternate installation disc
2007-12-31T10:28:00.000Z	[gquit]bombadil	lindzeyn	have you googled for fakeraid and/or sataraid?
2007-12-31T10:29:00.000Z	[gquit]bombadil		!fakeraid
2007-12-31T10:29:00.000Z	lindzeyn		I have tried fakeraid, I can get through the tut. without some bizzare error being thrown
2007-12-31T10:30:00.000Z	[gquit]bombadil		what's the error?
2007-12-31T10:31:00.000Z	lindzeyn		Well, in this tut https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto, I get errors when I try to get GRUB to work
2007-12-31T10:31:00.000Z	lindzeyn		I have decided to go ahead and use the Vista bootloader
2007-12-31T10:32:00.000Z	lindzeyn		but now I cant get gparted to format an ext3 partition
2007-12-31T10:32:00.000Z	lindzeyn		it says that the partition is already in use by the system
2007-12-31T10:32:00.000Z	lindzeyn		it = gparted
2007-12-31T10:34:00.000Z	[gquit]bombadil	lindzeyn	check to make sure that partition isnt mounted
2007-12-31T10:35:00.000Z	lindzeyn		okay
2007-12-31T10:39:00.000Z	[gquit]bombadil	lindzeyn	i'm going to sleep, good luck with your fakeraid
2007-12-31T10:39:00.000Z	lindzeyn	[gquit]bombadil	a softRAID + ubuntu installation should be fine in conjunction with the Vista bootloader correct?  Ubuntu wont wipe the MBA and softRAID doesnt need GRUB?
2007-12-31T10:40:00.000Z	[gquit]bombadil	lindzeyn	i cant say for sure, i've never dual booted a fakeraid
2007-12-31T10:40:00.000Z	lindzeyn	[gquit]bombadil	alrighty, thanks for your help
