2009-01-01T15:42:00.000Z	miranda_psi	outlaw1	is there an entry for it in the root crontab still?
2009-01-01T15:28:00.000Z	miranda_psi	outlaw1	can you put the script up in www.ubuntu.pastebin.com and post the link back
2009-01-01T15:33:00.000Z	outlaw1	miranda_psi	 http://www.ubuntu.pastebin.com/m2b10e7b7
2009-01-01T15:34:00.000Z	outlaw1	miranda_psi	 now when i run script from terminal it works fine and only starts once . but from "crontab" it starts twice so i'm thinking it might be something with crontab.
2009-01-01T15:38:00.000Z	miranda_psi	outlaw1	the script looks fine - do you have the script listed twice in crontab?
2009-01-01T15:40:00.000Z	outlaw1	miranda_psi	 no only once. i have even checked system and deleted backups of file just to make sure that it didnt have an effect on it somehow. I was trying to run it from root crontab at first and realized that i couldnt run as sudo then made another crontab for user
2009-01-01T15:40:00.000Z	outlaw1	miranda_psi	maybe I didnt delete properly or something. did everything from terminal
2009-01-01T15:42:00.000Z	outlaw1	miranda_psi	no, I only have 1 in there now and that's for a backup script which seems to work fine. but at first i was trying to run both. but only backup in there now
2009-01-01T15:43:00.000Z	outlaw1	miranda_psi	could there be another instance of it somewhere in another file that I'm not aware of ?
2009-01-01T15:44:00.000Z	miranda_psi	outlaw1	try deleting it from the crontab and see if it still gets run...
2009-01-01T15:46:00.000Z	outlaw1	miranda_psi	if i delete from crontab though it wouldnt be able to start would it ? I mean without me running script from terminal and I know that will start fine. I'm confused . sorry
2009-01-01T15:47:00.000Z	miranda_psi	outlaw1	i'm just trying to see if it will still run after you delete the instance you know of (thus meaning it is listed to run somewhere else)
2009-01-01T15:48:00.000Z	outlaw1	miranda_psi	so should i delete crontab and see if it runs from terminal ? what confuses me is that if i delete then it wont be scheduled to start so therefore it wont ?
2009-01-01T15:48:00.000Z	outlaw1	miranda_psi	sorry
2009-01-01T15:49:00.000Z	miranda_psi	outlaw1	since its running twice it might be that its listed twice - i'm just trying to see if thats the case or if its some other problem...
2009-01-01T15:49:00.000Z	outlaw1	miranda_psi	ok, i'll try that and see what happens
2009-01-01T15:54:00.000Z	outlaw1	miranda_psi	tried that and does nothing. I can still run from terminal naturally. I have even deleted backup ".sh~" file and searched filesystem and cant find any other files.
2009-01-01T15:54:00.000Z	outlaw1	miranda_psi	my crontab is simple 30 04 * * * /bin/radio.sh > /home/user/vlc.log 2>&1
2009-01-01T15:59:00.000Z	miranda_psi	outlaw1	so when you remove it - nothing gets run? do you get the same problem when you add it back in?
2009-01-01T16:00:00.000Z	outlaw1	miranda_psi	yes. I'm moving script to /usr/local/bin/ and deleted script from location it was in. not sure if it will change anything but worth a try i guess
2009-01-01T16:01:00.000Z	miranda_psi	outlaw1	if that doesn't work I don't know what to try next, but good luck :)
2009-01-01T16:01:00.000Z	outlaw1	miranda_psi	 I do appreciate your time. thank you
