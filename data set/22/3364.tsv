2009-12-28T14:09:00.000Z	MrDudle		so i have an external harddrive that has fedora on it with encryption
2009-12-28T14:09:00.000Z	MrDudle		i plug it into the computer i'm on now
2009-12-28T14:09:00.000Z	MrDudle		which is ubuntu
2009-12-28T14:10:00.000Z	MrDudle		and it asks for the encryption password and when i give it it gives me this error message Error unlocking device: cryptsetup exited with exit code 239: Command failed: Device already exists
2009-12-28T14:11:00.000Z	vlt	MrDudle	You can run the "unlocking" manually: `cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/your-crypted-partition name-for-uncrypted-device`
2009-12-28T14:13:00.000Z	MrDudle	vlt	i get this after doing that 160 GB Hard Disk: 160 GB Encrypted
2009-12-28T14:14:00.000Z	vlt	MrDudle	No, run the command without "`".
2009-12-28T14:14:00.000Z	MrDudle	vlt	that's what i did
2009-12-28T14:15:00.000Z	vlt	MrDudle	What is the name of the encrypted partition?
2009-12-28T14:15:00.000Z	vlt	MrDudle	No, I mean in /dev/
2009-12-28T14:15:00.000Z	vlt	MrDudle	Should be something like /dev/sdb1 for example
2009-12-28T14:16:00.000Z	vlt	MrDudle	What does `blkid` show you?
2009-12-28T14:17:00.000Z	MrDudle	vlt	i assume you mean to run the blkid in the terminal? if so nothing
2009-12-28T14:17:00.000Z	MrDudle	vlt	sdc1
2009-12-28T14:18:00.000Z	vlt	MrDudle	(Where did you run the cryptsetup cmd, if not in a terminal?) Maybe you need to run every command prepended with `sudo`
2009-12-28T14:19:00.000Z	MrDudle	vlt	cryptsetup: luksOpen: requires <device> <name>  as arguments
2009-12-28T14:21:00.000Z	MrDudle	vlt	what does the cryptsetup: luksOpen: requires <device> <name>  as arguments mean
2009-12-28T14:22:00.000Z	vlt	MrDudle	That's exactly the command I gave you before. `cryptsetup luksOpen source target`
2009-12-28T14:22:00.000Z	MrDudle	vlt	when i run it that's what it gives me
2009-12-28T14:22:00.000Z	vlt	MrDudle	 What exactly do you run? I can't see xour screen.
2009-12-28T14:24:00.000Z	MrDudle	vlt	now i get Command failed: Can not access device
2009-12-28T14:24:00.000Z	MrDudle	vlt	at least uit's letting me format now
