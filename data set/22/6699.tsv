2006-08-24T09:15:00.000Z	jman8888		Ummm....What do i do if i forget my USERNAME! (I set my sister up a pc and gave her her own username but forgot it...)
2006-08-24T09:16:00.000Z	Warbo	jman8888	I would boot into recovery mode, add a new user and add them to admin group
2006-08-24T09:16:00.000Z	jman8888	Warbo	How...
2006-08-24T09:17:00.000Z	Warbo	jman8888	adduser will add a user, but I forget how to add someone to a group
2006-08-24T09:19:00.000Z	jman8888	Warbo	I just found on Ubuntu forums to do revovery mode them cd /home then type ls... Seems so obvious.
2006-08-24T09:20:00.000Z	Warbo	jman8888	Oh, yeah. I don't know why I didn't think of that :)
2006-08-24T09:36:00.000Z	Warbo	jman8888	What kind of modem? (I am interested in this sort of thing)
2006-08-24T09:37:00.000Z	Warbo	jman8888	OK, I've never heard of that :)
2006-08-24T09:39:00.000Z	jman8888	Warbo	Its a wireless modem but i only have one D-Link. I already was using the ethernet on the back so i went for a risk and Tried ubuntu with the usb connection. And it worked.
2006-08-24T09:40:00.000Z	Warbo	jman8888	Do you mean /etc/hosts?
2006-08-24T09:41:00.000Z	jman8888	Warbo	? Will i be able to block sites like in windows with it?
2006-08-24T09:42:00.000Z	jman8888	Warbo	?
2006-09-01T07:20:00.000Z	Warbo	jman8888	For what?
2006-09-01T07:20:00.000Z	jman8888	Warbo	For making a 35gig partition from my 70 gig partion.
2006-09-01T07:21:00.000Z	Warbo	jman8888	Easy. Open it up, making sure that the partition isn't mounted, select it, right click, resize/move, fiddle it around a bit, apply, exit
2006-09-01T07:23:00.000Z	Warbo	jman8888	The hard drive doesn't matter, only the partition. If the partition is not currently mounted then you can mess around with it in GParted
2006-09-01T07:25:00.000Z	Warbo	jman8888	If it is being used then you can use an Ubuntu LiveCD to shrink it, since the Live CD doesn't need the hard drive to be mounted
2006-09-01T07:25:00.000Z	Warbo	jman8888	If you don't have an Ubuntu CD then the GParted Live CD is a much smaller download
2006-10-03T06:50:00.000Z	Warbo	jman8888	I would say either use soundconverter to make it low quality Ogg Vorbis (saves even more space because it has better compression) or extract it to Wave with soundconverter and use lame to reencode it
2006-10-03T06:51:00.000Z	Warbo	jman8888	OK, I would say either soundconverter or "mpg123 -w file.mp3" to get a wave, then "lame -b XX file.wav"
2006-10-03T06:53:00.000Z	jman8888	Warbo	 I got lame to do it. Just how can i make it do it to a folder?
2006-10-03T06:53:00.000Z	Warbo	jman8888	I don't know, you might need to find a script (Perl or Python probably)
