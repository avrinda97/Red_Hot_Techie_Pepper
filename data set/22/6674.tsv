2006-09-08T13:14:00.000Z	don_jr		How do I use a .bin file?
2006-09-08T13:14:00.000Z	davin	don_jr	./blabla.bin?
2006-09-08T13:14:00.000Z	don_jr	davin	I'll keep trying, that hasn't worked as of yet.
2006-09-08T13:15:00.000Z	davin	don_jr	as backlit said, make sure its chmod +x'ed
2006-09-08T13:16:00.000Z	don_jr	davin	how do I do that?  THis is my first nix system, sorry to be so needy.
2006-09-08T13:23:00.000Z	davin	don_jr	You're welcome, I'm learning too :-)
2006-09-08T13:21:00.000Z	davin	don_jr	you know what you just did with chmod? (maybe you know or what to know)
2006-09-08T13:21:00.000Z	don_jr	davin	I changed the file's permissions to make it executable I believe?
2006-09-08T13:22:00.000Z	davin	don_jr	yep sort of, you chmod (CHange MODe) it +x (Executable) So you just made the .bin executable instead of a bizzload of code :-)
2006-09-08T13:22:00.000Z	don_jr	davin	Thank you too, I appriciate it.
2006-09-08T13:25:00.000Z	davin	don_jr	you mean Java in a browser?

2006-09-08T13:26:00.000Z	davin	don_jr	http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/

2006-09-08T13:28:00.000Z	davin	don_jr	Use easyubuntu, it does everything for you, just make sure you dont check Videos, cause its borked
2006-09-08T13:32:00.000Z	don_jr	davin	that EasyUbuntu looks very nice.  Thank you.
2006-09-08T13:32:00.000Z	davin	don_jr	np, it should get your mp3 woes over too if you havent done it yet, I didnt have mp3 support in amaroK for months :[
2006-09-08T13:33:00.000Z	don_jr	davin	I'm also looking to see if I can get wmv files to run
