2009-01-08T22:53:00.000Z	albacker		size*
2009-01-08T22:55:00.000Z	albacker		can someone please tell me WHEN (during the instalation of ubuntu 8.10) can you choose the size of INODE (automatically if you format the partition its 256.. not 128)!!!???
2009-01-08T22:55:00.000Z	ASULutzy	albacker	Problems with the ext3 driver in Windows?
2009-01-08T22:57:00.000Z	albacker	ASULutzy	yes! i see that the only problem is to backup. reformat (with inode 128).. and restore. But i dont remember during the installation being asked for the inode size.. -_-
2009-01-08T22:57:00.000Z	ASULutzy	albacker	afaik you aren't asked, and I'm not really sure how you'd go about changing it in the live-cd
2009-01-08T22:58:00.000Z	ASULutzy	albacker	One of the reasons I don't use Intrepid on my desktop and stuck with Hardy
2009-01-08T22:59:00.000Z	albacker	ASULutzy	are you kiddin me? grrr >:0  but do you know (if i reformat and redo all the procedures) where can i choose the inode size?
2009-01-08T23:00:00.000Z	ASULutzy	albacker	mkfs.ext3 -I 128
2009-01-08T23:00:00.000Z	ASULutzy	albacker	You'll have to format the drive and setup the partitions first and then just tell Ubuntu to install to the partition that already exists
2009-01-08T23:01:00.000Z	albacker	ASULutzy	i got lost. the partitions are there.. i justs choose which partition i want to format and install ubuntu in. but i want also to be able to choose the inode size (which im not sure what it is)..
2009-01-08T23:02:00.000Z	ASULutzy	albacker	Say "/" is /dev/sda5. You'll want to do mkfs.ext3 -I 128 /dev/sda5
2009-01-08T23:03:00.000Z	ASULutzy	albacker	And then once you've got that formatted correctly, just tell Ubuntu to install to that partition (no need to tell it to format or do anything screwy to the partition after doing that)
2009-01-08T23:03:00.000Z	ASULutzy	albacker	Forums seem to be having some problems, but http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:CMFfz1rnG7QJ:ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php%3Ft%3D979523+setting+inode+size&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us
2009-01-08T23:03:00.000Z	albacker	ASULutzy	you're telling me to format it manually and not let ubuntu do the job.. right? most of the times i just put a lil tick on the format square.. so that means 'this partition needs formating' :D
2009-01-08T23:03:00.000Z	ASULutzy	albacker	Yes, you'll have to do it manually afaik
2009-01-08T23:04:00.000Z	albacker	ASULutzy	well that explains :) thanks a lot.. that just means .. more stuff to do for me :( and im not that happy.. it sux :'(
2009-01-08T23:05:00.000Z	ASULutzy	albacker	Yea, though there may very well be other options out there than the Windows driver we are using
2009-01-08T23:05:00.000Z	ASULutzy	albacker	There's no reason I can think of that an app couldn't be made to read from either inode size inside of Windows
2009-01-08T23:05:00.000Z	ASULutzy	albacker	I would spend at least 20 minutes googling if there is an alternative program before I went through the hassle of reformatting
2009-01-08T23:06:00.000Z	albacker	ASULutzy	explore2fs.. thats not a driver though.. ill have to copy everything from the ubuntu partition to my C:\ befrore reading it.
2009-01-08T23:12:00.000Z	albacker	ASULutzy	and a thing.. just tried explore2fs, it doesnt work (i think the reson is the same..). Thanks for the help. Bye!
