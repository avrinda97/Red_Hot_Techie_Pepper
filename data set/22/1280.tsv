2010-07-19T04:41:00.000Z	DasEi	ReadPlease	 specs of the box ?
2010-07-19T04:42:00.000Z	ReadPlease	DasEi	Specs - 2.8ghz p4 2gigs of ram, onboard video
2010-07-19T04:43:00.000Z	DasEi	ReadPlease	that's fine for both, win and ubu
2010-07-19T04:44:00.000Z	DasEi	ReadPlease	you can always tear down a linux-system to your needs, not so with windows, so that ubu will boot up faster and will be less ressource hungry, but above a ghz, standard apps run on both
2010-07-19T04:44:00.000Z	ReadPlease	DasEi	would you say that Win or Ubuntu would necessarily run faster, depending on what I do with the machine?
2010-07-19T04:45:00.000Z	ReadPlease	DasEi	do you know of a site where I can find a method for tearding down some of the apps

2010-07-19T04:48:00.000Z	DasEi	ReadPlease	for inet, you can sort out uneeded services in win as you can disable them in ubuntu, in general ubuntu as a linux can be made faster, because it needs less security-related stuff
2010-07-19T04:50:00.000Z	DasEi	ReadPlease	this is why linux is common in server-apps, no, it's not less secure, but more developed for it
