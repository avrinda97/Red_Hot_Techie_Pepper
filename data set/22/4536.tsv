2007-12-13T02:14:00.000Z	adelie		Scooter I am setting up some new tools for remote administration and computer management in my classroom. I have sy=tarted using cron jobs to "passwd student -l" at the end of each class period, and when students want to log on, use a script to "passwd student -d". Great thing about this is that I can have computers automatically lock at the end of a period without interupting a session, but if I need to log them out, and want to do it remotely, how would I
2007-12-13T02:16:00.000Z	adelie		Scooter how can I remotely log off a student via ssh other than, say, init 6
2007-12-13T02:16:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	adelie	kill its shell
2007-12-13T02:17:00.000Z	adelie	TallyWaxxor	?? won't that kill the xsession?
2007-12-13T02:18:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	adelie	Indeed
2007-12-13T02:18:00.000Z	adelie	TallyWaxxor	ok, want something a little ... elegant
2007-12-13T02:19:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	adelie	Aha, echo "Please log off from tty X evil student!" | wall :)
2007-12-13T03:07:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	adelie	lock ?
2007-12-13T03:07:00.000Z	adelie	TallyWaxxor	You know when you go to System -> Quit, there is an option to 'Lock Screen'
2007-12-13T03:08:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	adelie	aha, thats not ssh
2007-12-13T03:09:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	adelie	What do you get if you make a fullscreen window without any control buttons or frames ?
2007-12-13T03:14:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	adelie	Check this badboy -> http://mange.dynalias.org/linux/gadmin-rsync/screenshots (How do you like them bananas? :)
2007-12-13T03:15:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	adelie	Its competition-less, isnt it;)
2007-12-13T04:00:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	adelie	for retval in `ls -l /tmp`; do echo $retval; fi     (easier)
2007-12-13T04:00:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	adelie	Oh, dancer doesnt wanna show the dollar signs for some reason
2007-12-13T04:03:00.000Z	adelie	TallyWaxxor	hmm... $retval?
2007-12-13T04:03:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	adelie	yes, maybe its my chat program not showing it ?
2007-12-13T04:04:00.000Z	adelie	TallyWaxxor	$retval is clear before and after a ls -l, or am I not following....
2007-12-13T04:05:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	adelie	really nasty to show any kinds of scriptings here though :)
2007-12-13T04:05:00.000Z	adelie	TallyWaxxor	yeah, pastebin is better
2007-12-13T04:06:00.000Z	TallyWaxxor	adelie	Indeed because this ircd swallowed my first $retval or xchat did (not likely)
2007-12-13T04:06:00.000Z	adelie	TallyWaxxor	Gotta run, but some other time would love to know what that was
