2008-07-27T10:21:00.000Z	storm-zen	legend2440	Am I to take it, then, that what I'm doing wrong is trying to install grub to (hd2,0) instead of (hd2) ?
2008-07-27T10:23:00.000Z	storm-zen	legend2440	Installing to (hd2) didn't fix it either.
2008-07-27T10:25:00.000Z	legend2440	storm-zen	are you dual booting windows and ubuntu?
2008-07-27T10:25:00.000Z	storm-zen	legend2440	No.  There isn't a trace of Windows on the box.
2008-07-27T10:26:00.000Z	storm-zen	legend2440	Sorry, that may have sounded a little unfriendly.  I'm just frustrated.  Been at this for hours.
2008-07-27T10:26:00.000Z	legend2440	storm-zen	no problem
2008-07-27T10:32:00.000Z	legend2440	storm-zen	can you paste your   /boot/grub/menu.lst file
2008-07-27T10:38:00.000Z	storm-zen	legend2440	Sort of... I can type it what I'm trying to start the bootup.  In theory, I have access to the network on that box, but I would need some sort of script to get the contents to the pastebin.
2008-07-27T10:47:00.000Z	storm-zen	legend2440	http://paste.ubuntu.com/30812/  (thanks!)
2008-07-27T10:55:00.000Z	legend2440	storm-zen	sorry i can't tell much from that. not really familiar with Centos. have you tried googling   grub error 16?
2008-07-27T10:56:00.000Z	legend2440	storm-zen	perhaps someone in    channel    #centos  would know
2008-07-27T11:01:00.000Z	storm-zen	legend2440	Yes, tried googling error 16.  Was hoping for something common to linux.
2009-06-14T17:49:00.000Z	legend2440	storm-zen	are you using jaunty?
2009-06-14T17:50:00.000Z	legend2440	storm-zen	http://www.kubuntu.org/news/amarok-2.1  just add that  deb  line to the sources.lst file
2009-06-14T17:50:00.000Z	storm-zen	legend2440	Thanks so much. :)
2009-06-14T17:51:00.000Z	storm-zen	legend2440	Just ignore the no public key message?
2009-06-14T17:52:00.000Z	legend2440	storm-zen	yes
2009-06-14T17:53:00.000Z	storm-zen	legend2440	Is there more in that repo than just amarok?  ( I saw something like 83 packages will be held back and not upgraded... is that a separate issue? )
2009-06-14T17:56:00.000Z	legend2440	storm-zen	yes there are many packages in that repo. after you upgrade amarok you may want to remove or comment out that lineline from
2009-06-14T17:58:00.000Z	storm-zen	legend2440	Well, now it's crashing with SIGSEGV.  I guess you didn't get that result?
2009-06-14T18:00:00.000Z	legend2440	storm-zen	actually i've never tried upgrading amarok  someone in  channel #amarok may have answers for you
