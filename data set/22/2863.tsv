2009-02-11T14:49:00.000Z	marius222		hello. i need some help about changing themes. COuld someone help me please?
2009-02-11T14:51:00.000Z	marius222		when i change the themes, somehow "controls" (progress bar, radio check's, scrollbars) remain unchanged. Is there some "global" settings, where this could be locked?
2009-02-11T14:52:00.000Z	marius222		i did exactly the same changes in another PC, and it did work perfectly. On this PC progress bars, radio buttons , scrollbars always remain orange - when the theme clearly has it blue.
2009-02-11T14:52:00.000Z	marius222		someone? pls
2009-02-11T14:54:00.000Z	marius222		well, right click desktop
2009-02-11T14:54:00.000Z	marius222		installed the theme
2009-02-11T14:55:00.000Z	marius222		i did
2009-02-11T14:56:00.000Z	marius222		but does not matter which theme (even standard themes) do i apply, these things do not change from orange. I click "customize", go onto the controls tab, i change the themes for the controls, but they do not change
2009-02-11T14:57:00.000Z	marius222		i tried to look for the gtkrc file of the theme i use - and the links to the scrollbars are correct. They should be blue
2009-02-11T14:58:00.000Z	rakudave	marius222	metacity != compiz
2009-02-11T15:01:00.000Z	marius222	rakudave	- what exactly do you mean?
2009-02-11T15:02:00.000Z	rakudave	marius222	sorry :) this means that if you change the metacity theme, it might not change the compiz theme, depending on your settings
2009-02-11T15:07:00.000Z	marius222	rakudave	- everything else from metacity theme works, except controls (progress bar, radio buttons, check buttons, scrollbars). In compiz settings there is nothing, that could affect these things as far as i can find
2009-02-11T15:08:00.000Z	rakudave	marius222	then it might be that the specific control-theme is not installed correctly or something... (?)
2009-02-11T15:11:00.000Z	marius222	rakudave	- well, it happens even when i do change the preinstalled (standard) themes. So it is not the theme installation issue. And i installed the same theme on other PC's in exactly the same way, and it worked. There is something in this particular PC that prevents theme controls to show up, some settings ovverride it (but only the controls). Is there something like global gtkrc file?
2009-02-11T15:13:00.000Z	marius222	rakudave	- could you please tell me how to temporary stop compiz to see if it is the problem?
2009-02-11T15:13:00.000Z	rakudave	marius222	i don't think so... i'm out of ideas (except that themes wont work with anything running as sudo such as synaptics etc...)
2009-02-11T15:14:00.000Z	rakudave	marius222	"metacity --replace" in a terminal and "compiz-start" to start compiz again
2009-02-11T15:21:00.000Z	marius222	rakudave	- no, stopping compiz does not help
2009-02-11T15:23:00.000Z	rakudave	marius222	hmm... all themes are located in /home/you/.themes perhaps you can solve the problem by looking in there and see if the theme you intend to activate exists there and has all the parts it requires
2009-02-11T15:28:00.000Z	marius222	rakudave	- hm... it seems like controls (radio buttons, checkboxes etc) are the same for all themes. Very strange
2009-02-11T15:29:00.000Z	rakudave	marius222	strange... can't think of another explanation... perhaps you might try to download a theme from gnome-look.org and see if this works. if not, it if proof that something is wrong with your metacity
