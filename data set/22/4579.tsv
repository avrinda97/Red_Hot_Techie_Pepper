2007-12-05T23:11:00.000Z	Strangelv	bard1988	your problem is you need X to not be running, right?
2007-12-05T23:12:00.000Z	bard1988	Strangelv	i want to run X - configure command
2007-12-05T23:12:00.000Z	bard1988	Strangelv	but it keeps telling me
2007-12-05T23:12:00.000Z	Strangelv	bard1988	try booting into single user mode -- or is it someone else I need to be telling thisL I can't keep track
2007-12-05T23:12:00.000Z	bard1988	Strangelv	boot what :P?
2007-12-05T23:12:00.000Z	Strangelv	bard1988	in GRUB on bootup -- get it to list boot options
2007-12-05T23:13:00.000Z	bard1988	Strangelv	how do i do that?
2007-12-05T23:13:00.000Z	Strangelv		bard: GRUB comes up on boot.  In some situations it will present you wvith a menu by default
2007-12-05T23:14:00.000Z	Strangelv	bard1988	in others you'll need to hit something to force it to provide a menu
2007-12-05T23:14:00.000Z	Strangelv	bard1988	no, I don't remember what to press
2007-12-05T23:14:00.000Z	Strangelv		Does anyone know how to shut down X Server without it starting instantly and without rebooting?
