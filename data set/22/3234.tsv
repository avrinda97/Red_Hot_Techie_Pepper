2012-04-11T12:04:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	aplund	what problem do you have with binutils / efi?
2012-04-11T12:04:00.000Z	aplund	mrintegr1ty	Is there a package?
2012-04-11T12:04:00.000Z	aplund	mrintegr1ty	binutils-multiarch doesn't seem to have support
2012-04-11T12:05:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	aplund	it's never been an issue for me.. what problem does that create? i'm curious, not sure i will be able to help
2012-04-11T12:05:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	aplund	i mean, you can still boot systems with efi right?
2012-04-11T12:05:00.000Z	aplund	mrintegr1ty	objcopy --help doesn't list efi-app-*
2012-04-11T12:06:00.000Z	aplund	mrintegr1ty	err. yeah.  I'm talking about binutils.
2012-04-11T12:07:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	aplund	ah i see, so ubuntu binutils comes without the required patches / support for efi?
2012-04-11T12:07:00.000Z	aplund	mrintegr1ty	I hope not.  But that might be the case.
2012-04-11T12:09:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	aplund	it doesn't seem like it does unfortunately
2012-04-11T12:09:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	aplund	in which case you will have to rebuild the package and include efi support, hopefully it's included in the debian src package but just not enabled
2012-04-11T12:09:00.000Z	aplund	mrintegr1ty	Yeah.  Just what I wanted to avoid.
2012-04-11T12:10:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	aplund	incase you don't already know howto rebuild deb packages: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/rebuilding-ubuntu-debian-linux-binary-package/ <-- seems like a througho howto
2012-04-11T12:11:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	aplund	not too much work
2012-04-11T12:12:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	aplund	is it a one off thing? horrible work around would be boot a distro that has that support built in as a vm to do what you need
2012-04-11T12:12:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	aplund	rebuilding the package would be quicker
2012-04-11T12:14:00.000Z	aplund	mrintegr1ty	Thanks for the link
2012-04-11T12:14:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	aplund	np
2012-04-11T12:25:00.000Z	aplund	mrintegr1ty	seems that binutils-multiarch is only multiarch for the platforms debian is targerted for
2012-04-11T12:26:00.000Z	aplund	mrintegr1ty	i.e the ones in /usr/share/dpkg/archtable
2012-04-11T12:40:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	aplund	you still have my suggestion of using a vm with an os that does support it
2012-04-11T12:59:00.000Z	aplund	mrintegr1ty	It seems that it is not so easy to configure the build to do this
