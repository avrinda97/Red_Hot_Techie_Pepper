2005-11-23T06:25:00.000Z	bob2	CriminalMacabre	is the driver loaded or not? you're wasting your time until you establish that
2005-11-23T06:25:00.000Z	CriminalMacabre	bob2	how can be loaded if it doesnt detect a soundcard?
2005-11-23T06:26:00.000Z	bob2	CriminalMacabre	what on eaerth does "detect a soundcard" mean? find it physically connected to the PCI bus?
2005-11-23T06:26:00.000Z	bob2	CriminalMacabre	no, you're being silly
2005-11-23T06:26:00.000Z	bob2	CriminalMacabre	is the driver for it loaded or not? does lspci show it or not? what does dmsg say?
2005-11-23T06:30:00.000Z	CriminalMacabre	bob2	lspci shows my device
2005-11-23T06:33:00.000Z	bob2	CriminalMacabre	so put your whole /var/log/dmesg up somewhere
