2010-09-13T09:49:00.000Z	dzere		Yes, I'm typing this. I did not know there was another way. I'm working with a wire-connected Windows Vista PC and a Gateway Ubuntu computer whose wireless is not working.
2010-09-13T09:49:00.000Z	dzere		My best bet is Ethernet Controller or Network Controller. Do these sound right?
2010-09-13T09:50:00.000Z	dzere		No, I haven't. Would you like me to do this and reconnect? IÂ´m just trying to avoid losing my help team here in the chat.
2010-09-13T09:51:00.000Z	dzere		Whatcha think, Flannel?
2010-09-13T09:52:00.000Z	dzere		I think I could plug it into my Ubuntu modem, see if the Internet works, and continue the chat from there.
2010-09-13T09:52:00.000Z	dzere		Okay, let me look.
2010-09-13T09:53:00.000Z	dzere		Thanks again, Flannel. Okay, lots of information here to sort through...
2010-09-13T09:54:00.000Z	dzere		I see things that say Host Controllor or Hub but nothing that specifically rings a bell, "Wifi" in my head.
2010-09-13T09:55:00.000Z	dzere		I'm trying.
2010-09-13T09:56:00.000Z	dzere		Okay, let me see what I can find.
2010-09-13T09:57:00.000Z	glebihan	dzere	use pastebin to paste the output so we can have a look
2010-09-13T09:59:00.000Z	dzere	glebihan	- I'm typing on a Windows PC. I will have to lose this connection to connect it to my Ubuntu laptop, but I am willing to do it if you both approve. It may just take a minute for me to get back, and I'm afraid I'll lose you guys in the process. (And have to start all over.) Should I disconnect and then paste?
2010-09-13T10:00:00.000Z	glebihan	dzere	no it's ok you found you wifi card
2010-09-13T10:04:00.000Z	glebihan	dzere	sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
2010-09-13T10:06:00.000Z	dzere	glebihan	interesting! "No such device."!
2010-09-13T10:06:00.000Z	glebihan	dzere	what output do you get with "sudo ifconfig" ?
2010-09-13T10:07:00.000Z	glebihan	dzere	it's automatic because we put your nick in it
2010-09-13T10:08:00.000Z	glebihan	dzere	I'm not moving
2010-09-13T10:09:00.000Z	glebihan	dzere	I'm in France so here it's early (7 AM)
2010-09-13T10:10:00.000Z	dzere	glebihan	I suspected you might be European. I miss Europe so badly. (I want to move back ASAP.) I lived in Germany for a year; can understand French. I'm also Lithuanian-American but in terms of paperwork, that's a nightmare.
2010-09-13T10:14:00.000Z	dzere	glebihan	Merci beaucoup. Je reviens.
2010-09-13T10:14:00.000Z	glebihan	dzere	de rien :)
