2007-03-30T10:31:00.000Z	compilerwriter		I would be happy to tell you how I remotely log in to my headless box if that would be of some use.
2007-03-30T10:31:00.000Z	lincoln5	compilerwriter	yes
2007-03-30T10:32:00.000Z	lincoln5	compilerwriter	aye?
2007-03-30T10:34:00.000Z	compilerwriter	lincoln5	 Is that a request for more info, or are you not understanding what I am telling you?
2007-03-30T10:35:00.000Z	lincoln5	compilerwriter	I dont understand what you said.
2007-03-30T10:36:00.000Z	lincoln5	compilerwriter	ok, i think I am trying to do something totally different to that.
2007-03-30T10:36:00.000Z	compilerwriter	lincoln5	What are you trying to accomplish?
2007-03-30T10:38:00.000Z	lincoln5	compilerwriter	seamlessrdp lets you in simplest terms connect to a window in windows instead of an rdp session so you would rdp to your windows machine and specify notepad and a notepad window would open in *nux.
2007-03-30T10:39:00.000Z	lincoln5	compilerwriter	or http://www.cendio.com/seamlessrdp/
2007-03-30T10:39:00.000Z	compilerwriter	lincoln5	 I can tell you how to do that in reverse of what you are saying.
2007-03-30T10:40:00.000Z	lincoln5	compilerwriter	what would the reverse be?
2007-03-30T10:43:00.000Z	lincoln5	compilerwriter	ok so how would I have windows(tm) windows in X?
2007-03-30T10:49:00.000Z	compilerwriter	lincoln5	most everything I can find has one utilizing *nix from windows.  Give me a second though.
2007-03-30T10:53:00.000Z	lincoln5	compilerwriter	thats what I can currently do, but what I am trying to do here is rdp to *only* an IE window or *only* an Outlook window, so its like a native linux program.
2007-03-30T10:55:00.000Z	compilerwriter	lincoln5	 That is the best I can do to help you.  I can get things set up to do it in reverse, but know of no way to do it the way you would like.
2007-03-30T11:01:00.000Z	lincoln5	compilerwriter	where is that?
2007-03-30T11:03:00.000Z	lincoln5	compilerwriter	hey it kind of worked

2007-03-30T11:05:00.000Z	compilerwriter	lincoln5	What kind of worked?
2007-03-30T11:06:00.000Z	lincoln5	compilerwriter	ive got a notepad window open infront of xchat
2007-03-30T11:08:00.000Z	lincoln5	compilerwriter	but I have two spare windows and windows in the background of my two screens
