2005-09-26T08:32:00.000Z	kataklysm		well i'm getting ubuntu installed on my other box, i dont know if it will work right though.. if i change the way my IDE drives are oriented to the motherboard, will it mess up how my linux install runs?
2005-09-26T08:33:00.000Z	bob2	kataklysm	...yes
2005-09-26T08:34:00.000Z	kataklysm	bob2	so if i change it from slave to master, it wont boot? even if i dont have another drive?  see ubuntu installer wouldnt detect my hd with the jp on cableselect, so i changed the pin, it detected it, but as slave, so if i change that pin back over to cs after install or to pri, it wont work?
2005-09-26T08:34:00.000Z	kataklysm	bob2	its dev hdb
2005-09-26T08:34:00.000Z	bob2	kataklysm	get a boot cd
2005-09-26T08:35:00.000Z	kataklysm	bob2	why did u say get a boot cd?
2005-09-26T08:36:00.000Z	bob2	kataklysm	so you can fix it when it fails to boot
2005-09-26T08:36:00.000Z	kataklysm	bob2	if i just change it from hdb to hda it should boot though right?, but will the OS see things different when it changes?
2005-09-26T08:36:00.000Z	bob2	kataklysm	if you say so
2005-09-26T08:37:00.000Z	kataklysm	bob2	i will just see what happens when install gets done.. i dont know why it didnt detect my hd with CS, the bios did, and rhel always did.. didnt make much sense
2005-09-26T08:39:00.000Z	bob2	kataklysm	please don't spread lies
2005-09-26T08:40:00.000Z	bob2	kataklysm	if it doesn't work, file a serious bug immediately
2005-09-26T08:40:00.000Z	bob2	kataklysm	it has worked for thousands of other people
2005-09-26T08:41:00.000Z	kataklysm	bob2	it probably has worked for a lot of people, it also has messed a lot of people up, why not just install from boot instead of while your in the OS?
2005-09-26T08:41:00.000Z	bob2	kataklysm	wtf
2005-09-26T08:41:00.000Z	bob2	kataklysm	if people have issues THEY NEED TO FILE BUGS
2005-09-26T08:42:00.000Z	bob2	kataklysm	upgrading with aptitude while the system is running is completely supported, and the only sane way to upgrade a system
2005-09-26T08:42:00.000Z	kataklysm	bob2	well from just about any debian / gentoo forum or room i have ever been on, they do not recommend doing a dist-upgrade from within x
2005-09-26T08:42:00.000Z	bob2	kataklysm	forums and rooms, indeed. those peopel are clueless.
2005-09-26T08:43:00.000Z	bob2	kataklysm	no
2005-09-26T08:43:00.000Z	bob2	kataklysm	wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgradeNotes
2005-09-26T08:43:00.000Z	bob2	kataklysm	if it actually breaks for people, they need to file bugs instead of whinging on forus
