2007-09-02T07:46:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		twinx: That seems to have made things a bit faster... I still see the progress bar for just a bit less than a minute and a half though.
2007-09-02T07:48:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		twinx: Here's the current one. http://pastebin.com/d5ad2d027
2007-09-02T07:50:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		Twinx: No, it comes up quickly enough. I don't think I'm supposed to see it for that long though.
2007-09-02T07:52:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		twinx: "That long" being about 80-85 seconds, really... But then XP takes around 40 to get to login and I'm sure I heard 20-30 is the norm for ubuntu. Heck I'm sure it was the norm with my previous installation.
2007-09-02T07:54:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		twinx: Like?
2007-09-02T07:55:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		anlar: I suspect I may have made all the small tweaks to make it take as long as it can, heh. I'd just be happy if it didn't have me wait another 5 minutes after login.
2007-09-02T07:56:00.000Z	soundray	Ar-Pharazon	that's not normal. Are you sure your /etc/hosts is okay?
2007-09-02T07:56:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	soundray	I have no idea what /etc/hosts even does, to be frank.
2007-09-02T07:57:00.000Z	soundray	Ar-Pharazon	it associates IP addresses with names. The first line should read "127.0.0.1 localhost", the second should show your LAN IP and hostname. Here, it's "192.168.1.18 piano" for example.
2007-09-02T07:58:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	soundray	http://pastebin.com/d29b4cbb5 This is after the two 127.0.-something addresses.
2007-09-02T07:58:00.000Z	soundray	Ar-Pharazon	if that second line is wrong or missing, you get delays at login
2007-09-02T07:59:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	soundray	Oh the second line is "127.0.1.1   [computer name] " Is that wrong?
2007-09-02T07:59:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	soundray	By the way... We are talking about ubuntu booting slow, right?
2007-09-02T07:59:00.000Z	soundray	Ar-Pharazon	no, /etc/hosts problems result in delays after password entry on gdm.
2007-09-02T08:00:00.000Z	soundray	Ar-Pharazon	to tweak actual bootup times, you have to edit services.
2007-09-02T08:00:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	soundray	Nope, I don't have any problems there. All the delay happens right in the middle of booting.
2007-09-02T08:01:00.000Z	soundray	Ar-Pharazon	okay, then I misinterpreted your statement "I'd just be happy if it didn't have me wait another 5 minutes after login."
2007-09-02T08:01:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	soundray	Oh... Uh, sorry. That was about XP. Umm.
2007-09-02T08:02:00.000Z	soundray	Ar-Pharazon	nm
2007-09-02T08:14:00.000Z	soundray	Ar-Pharazon	edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and remove all occurrences of "quiet splash"
2007-09-02T08:15:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	soundray	quiet splash only or just "quiet" too?
2007-09-02T08:16:00.000Z	soundray	Ar-Pharazon	quiet, too, if it occurs without splash
