2007-01-06T13:52:00.000Z	newbieme		my strategy is to copy my xorg.conf file
2007-01-06T13:52:00.000Z	newbieme		for backup
2007-01-06T13:53:00.000Z	newbieme		then run the config and copy down the horizontal and veritcal syncs from the newly-generated file
2007-01-06T13:53:00.000Z	newbieme		and then simply copy my original xorg back over, and replace the proper sync values
2007-01-06T13:53:00.000Z	newbieme		works like a charm
2007-01-06T13:54:00.000Z	newbieme		unless you have people accessing your pc and you don't want them messing with those files
2007-01-06T13:54:00.000Z	newbieme		well then 777 will be fine
2007-01-06T13:54:00.000Z	newbieme		and you can always change it later
