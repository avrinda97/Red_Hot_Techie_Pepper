2012-04-16T12:17:00.000Z	Boneripper_		interesting.. as to what the problem might be
2012-04-16T12:18:00.000Z	domsom	Boneripper_	if you can't even ping the XP box from other network nodes, the XP box is either down or not connected
2012-04-16T12:25:00.000Z	domsom	Boneripper_	can you access the internet from your xp box?
2012-04-16T12:28:00.000Z	domsom	Boneripper_	can you ping the ubuntu boxes from XP?
2012-04-16T12:28:00.000Z	domsom	Boneripper_	(the XP box is connected to the same router as the ubuntu boxes, I assume)
2012-04-16T12:30:00.000Z	domsom	Boneripper_	hmm
2012-04-16T12:30:00.000Z	domsom	Boneripper_	yes, if you're in nautilus
2012-04-16T12:31:00.000Z	domsom	Boneripper_	try 'smbtree smb://192.168...' on the commandline
2012-04-16T12:33:00.000Z	domsom	Boneripper_	as soon as you find the cause, you'll know what you did last night ;-)
2012-04-16T12:34:00.000Z	domsom	Boneripper_	but to find out, you need the error messages
2012-04-16T12:38:00.000Z	domsom	Boneripper_	did it ask you for your password?
2012-04-16T12:39:00.000Z	domsom	Boneripper_	if you browse the network on your XP box, can you see the shares there?
2012-04-16T12:41:00.000Z	domsom	Boneripper_	any firewall settings on the XP box?
