2004-08-30T14:43:00.000Z	daniels	rburton	yo
2004-08-30T14:49:00.000Z	daniels	rburton	walk in, turn left, first right into the conference centre, up the stairs, first right to the end into the cherwell room
2004-09-01T14:43:00.000Z	daniels	rburton	i suggest 'mad phat'
2004-09-01T14:44:00.000Z	rburton	daniels	you can only say "mad phat" if cruising down a street with jdub's banging ghetto blaster
2004-09-01T15:17:00.000Z	rburton	daniels	so my lcd manual says it supports "ddc 1/2b" yet xresprobe says its a generic monitor (non ddc)
2004-09-01T15:40:00.000Z	daniels	rburton	what does ddcprobe say?
2004-09-12T16:41:00.000Z	daniels	rburton	pc104 used to work, but now you just silently use a key :)
2004-09-19T06:54:00.000Z	rburton	daniels	i'll torment you as well unless you tell me where your x.org debs are ;)
2004-09-19T06:55:00.000Z	daniels	rburton	http://fooishbar.org/daniel/canonical-x/, i'm not even going to tell you what the deb line is because HERE BE DRAGONS, seriously
2004-09-19T06:56:00.000Z	daniels	rburton	if you really, seriously need them, i'll upload all the source packages form my laptop; expecting those ones to even install is a bit of a stretch as i was in the middle of redoing all of them when i started exclusively working on warty concerns
2004-09-19T06:58:00.000Z	rburton	daniels	i keep on thinking about playing with composite et al, that is all
2004-09-19T06:58:00.000Z	daniels	rburton	ah. probably best to just bust out jhbuild and build kdrive, then?
2004-09-19T06:59:00.000Z	rburton	daniels	yeah
2004-09-19T07:02:00.000Z	rburton	daniels	its great
2004-09-19T07:03:00.000Z	rburton	daniels	hoff and shatner are in it
2004-09-19T07:04:00.000Z	daniels	rburton	DUDE! no shit?
2004-09-19T07:04:00.000Z	rburton	daniels	http://imdb.com/title/tt0364725/fullcredits
2004-09-19T07:06:00.000Z	rburton	daniels	isn't that against some international law?
2004-10-01T06:27:00.000Z	rburton	daniels	isn't this pleasant?
2004-10-01T06:27:00.000Z	daniels	rburton	yeah, just accidentally whacked the wrong key. how's things?
2004-10-01T06:28:00.000Z	rburton	daniels	not bad. finally saw Shaun Of The Dead so things are looking up. you?
2004-10-01T06:28:00.000Z	daniels	rburton	neat. not too badly myself.
