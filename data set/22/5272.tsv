2007-06-05T08:42:00.000Z	brian1		When I try and open synaptic and I get
2007-06-05T08:42:00.000Z	brian1		E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
2007-06-05T08:42:00.000Z	brian1		E: _cache->open() failed, please report.
2007-06-05T08:42:00.000Z	brian1		And when when I open up the terminal and run that nothing happens. Can any help me out?
2007-06-05T08:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brian1	 ya used a 'sudo' at the front of the command?
2007-06-05T08:43:00.000Z	brian1		yes
2007-06-05T08:44:00.000Z	brian1	Dr_willis	Yes, and after that It asked for the password which I entered and then it told me it was wrong. I continued to try, but it still told me it was wrong
2007-06-05T08:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brian1	 you are using the proper (sudo user, the first user's) password?
2007-06-05T08:45:00.000Z	brian1	Dr_willis	Yes, I'm using admin password
2007-06-05T08:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brian1	 try opening a root shell with 'sudo -s'
2007-06-05T08:47:00.000Z	brian1	Dr_willis	It's telling me this now: bash: sudu: command not found. Maybe I typed it wrong. I'll try again and then ill try opening a root sheel with 'sudu -s'
2007-06-05T08:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brian1	'sudo -a'
2007-06-05T08:48:00.000Z	brian1	Dr_willis	Okay
2007-06-05T08:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brian1	 err sudo -s
2007-06-05T08:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis		:)
2007-06-05T08:48:00.000Z	brian1		haha, alright
2007-06-05T08:49:00.000Z	brian1	Dr_willis	Now, how do i do what you said?
2007-06-05T08:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brian1	 that gives you a root shell.  use your commands from there.
2007-06-05T08:51:00.000Z	brian1	Dr_willis	So put this sudu -s 'dpkg --confifure -a'
2007-06-05T08:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	brian1	 suDO DO DO ... 'sudo -s' gives you a root terminal, then all commands you enter as ran as root.
2007-06-05T08:53:00.000Z	brian1	Dr_willis	Alright, thanks
