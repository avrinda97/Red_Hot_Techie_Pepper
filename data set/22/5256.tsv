2007-10-10T08:35:00.000Z	nrdb	flokuehn	you can use the command 'dd'
2007-10-10T08:35:00.000Z	flokuehn	nrdb	thank you
2007-10-10T08:35:00.000Z	nrdb	flokuehn	I use "dd if=/dev/hdc of=x.iso"
2007-10-24T17:22:00.000Z	flokuehn	nrdb	you have to reconfigure your xorg
2007-10-24T17:22:00.000Z	flokuehn	nrdb	you have installed the nvidia linux kernel?
2007-10-24T17:23:00.000Z	nrdb	flokuehn	I have run nvidia-glx-config (several times) and nvidia-xconfig, and the the xorg.conf has the the 'nvidia' driver in the right place.
2007-10-24T17:24:00.000Z	flokuehn	nrdb	ok. then you made an error
2007-10-24T17:24:00.000Z	nrdb	flokuehn	any idea what.
2007-10-24T17:24:00.000Z	flokuehn	nrdb	äähhh an mistake i mean. i had the same video card and it worked well
2007-10-24T17:25:00.000Z	flokuehn	nrdb	you have to tell me the whole way and stuff you installed
2007-10-24T17:25:00.000Z	flokuehn	nrdb	step for step
2007-10-24T17:26:00.000Z	flokuehn	nrdb	btw. have you ever tried the envy script for installing an video card
2007-10-24T17:26:00.000Z	nrdb	flokuehn	I been going around in circles with this for at least the last 2 hours.
2007-10-24T17:26:00.000Z	nrdb	flokuehn	envy ?
2007-10-24T17:26:00.000Z	flokuehn	nrdb	try googling for 'envy script' and maybe this will give you an better way
2007-10-24T17:28:00.000Z	flokuehn	nrdb	then dont try it with the envy script.
2007-10-24T17:29:00.000Z	flokuehn	nrdb	you should have done the following steps for getting you video card to work.
2007-10-24T17:30:00.000Z	flokuehn	nrdb	sudo apt-get install nvidia-kernel-common nvidia-settings && sudo dpkg --reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-10-24T17:36:00.000Z	nrdb	flokuehn	well envy is going now, be a while till it does everything.  hopefully it will work.
