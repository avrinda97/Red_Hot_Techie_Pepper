2008-05-17T14:13:00.000Z	Crazed		gf8400M G
2008-05-17T14:13:00.000Z	Crazed		that is for the drivers nvdia-glx right
2008-05-17T14:14:00.000Z	Crazed		I am talking about the nvidia.com drivers
2008-05-17T14:15:00.000Z	Crazed		...
2008-05-17T14:15:00.000Z	wols	Crazed	dpkg -l |grep nvidia
2008-05-17T14:15:00.000Z	wols	Crazed	you need a kernel-module for your running kernel there
2008-05-17T14:15:00.000Z	wols	Crazed	modprobe nvidia
2008-05-17T14:17:00.000Z	wols	Crazed	you have the kernel source but not a compiled module
2008-05-17T14:18:00.000Z	Crazed	wols	I used that nvidia script
2008-05-17T14:18:00.000Z	wols	Crazed	it didn't. you can try with "modprobe nvidia"
2008-05-17T14:20:00.000Z	wols	Crazed	no
2008-05-17T14:21:00.000Z	wols	Crazed	modprobe nvidia    works?
2008-05-17T14:21:00.000Z	wols	Crazed	that's fine
2008-05-17T14:21:00.000Z	wols	Crazed	so now enter "nvidia" without quotes into /etc/modules
2008-05-17T14:23:00.000Z	wols	Crazed	tho, using nvidia.com drivers is bad. but your choice if you want to break the package management
2008-05-17T14:25:00.000Z	wols	Crazed	cause you intall stuff outside your package management
