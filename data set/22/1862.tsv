2010-02-28T01:05:00.000Z	bikcmp		How do I remove a shared network folder?
2010-02-28T01:05:00.000Z	bikcmp		under places, I want to remove it.
2010-02-28T01:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	bikcmp	right click the folder and go into properties > Sharing
2010-02-28T01:06:00.000Z	bikcmp	IdleOne	It won't let me right click it.
2010-02-28T01:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	bikcmp	not from the menu but from within nautilus
2010-02-28T01:08:00.000Z	bikcmp	IdleOne	how would I get there?
2010-02-28T01:10:00.000Z	IdleOne	bikcmp	click on Places > Home folder and navigate to the folder you want to stop sharing
2010-02-28T01:11:00.000Z	bikcmp	IdleOne	I think you mis-understood, I ment I did places>connect to server
2010-02-28T01:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	bikcmp	i think you are right. can you please restate your question
2010-02-28T01:14:00.000Z	bikcmp	IdleOne	I used connect to server to try to connect to a server, and now I want to remove it from the list.
2010-02-28T01:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	bikcmp	hmm not sure, sorry.
2010-09-04T06:32:00.000Z	IdleOne	bikcmp	windows first
2010-09-04T06:32:00.000Z	IdleOne	bikcmp	otherwise the windows boot loader does not see ubuntu
2010-09-04T06:33:00.000Z	bikcmp	IdleOne	oh
2010-09-04T06:34:00.000Z	IdleOne	bikcmp	grub can but windows will install it's bootloader to the mbr and not see ubuntu
2010-09-04T06:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	bikcmp	so you want to install windows first and then ubuntu so grub can recognize them both
2010-09-04T06:35:00.000Z	bikcmp	IdleOne	darn it, that sucks... I just got my ubuntu usb drive
2010-09-04T06:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	bikcmp	but that said you can always reinstall grub2
2010-09-04T06:35:00.000Z	bikcmp	IdleOne	i guess i'll just virtualbox... i really don't feel like redoing it
2010-09-04T06:35:00.000Z	bikcmp	IdleOne	ah
2010-09-04T06:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	bikcmp	sure thing
2010-09-04T06:36:00.000Z	bikcmp	IdleOne	i'll just use virtualbox, thanks for your help man, I appreciate it
