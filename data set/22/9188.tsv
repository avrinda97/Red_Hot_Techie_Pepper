2005-03-04T09:54:00.000Z	apokryphos	tritium	Yup, I know. That's what I meant. =)
2005-03-04T09:54:00.000Z	tritium	apokryphos	ok, :)
2005-03-04T11:53:00.000Z	tritium	apokryphos	nvidia for binary drivers in linux-restricted-modules, nv otherwise
2005-03-05T12:23:00.000Z	tritium	apokryphos	libqt3-dev in Warty or Hoary main is not what you want?
2005-03-05T12:24:00.000Z	tritium	apokryphos	did you apt-cache search qt | grep dev ?
2005-03-05T12:25:00.000Z	apokryphos	tritium	Hm, interesting. Title must have originally put me off. I'll see if libqt3-mt-dev will do it
2005-03-06T07:47:00.000Z	tritium	apokryphos	look for your xlibmesa-* packages
2005-03-06T07:49:00.000Z	apokryphos	tritium	Hm, yeah, I seem to have all the necessary stuff there. This is really weird. Should it not install things to /usr/lib/libGL?
2005-03-06T07:49:00.000Z	apokryphos	tritium	Since, that's where this install is looking for it (in the make)
2005-03-06T07:51:00.000Z	tritium	apokryphos	there is stuff in /usr/lib
2005-03-06T07:53:00.000Z	tritium	apokryphos	if you're building stuff, you probably want xlibmesa-dev package
2005-03-06T07:54:00.000Z	apokryphos	tritium	I've got the Mesa OpenGL utility library development file; does that cover it?
2005-03-06T07:55:00.000Z	tritium	apokryphos	what's the package name?
2005-03-06T07:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	tritium	what package am I looking to get?
2005-03-06T07:59:00.000Z	tritium	apokryphos	I'm not sure.
2005-03-06T08:01:00.000Z	tritium	apokryphos	I would just try installing libx11-dev
2005-03-06T08:02:00.000Z	apokryphos	tritium	I seem to have that installed
2005-03-06T08:03:00.000Z	apokryphos	tritium	is that not xfree stuff?
2005-03-06T08:08:00.000Z	tritium	apokryphos	no, I don't see anything wrong with that.
2005-09-07T13:29:00.000Z	apokryphos	tritium	hola!
2005-09-11T08:23:00.000Z	apokryphos	tritium	yeah, gonna make it registered-only
