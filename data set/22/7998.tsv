2005-11-05T16:15:00.000Z	private_meta		could maybe someone be able to help me with a problem?
2005-11-05T16:17:00.000Z	private_meta		i've got a system with winxp, and i installed ubuntu 5.10 on another partition. i configured everything, installed some stuff... then i wanted to boot windows... had to boot with secure mode, then normally... worked right... after that ubuntu wasn't able to boot anymore
2005-11-05T16:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	private_meta	why have you to boot in secure mode??
2005-11-05T16:19:00.000Z	private_meta	erUSUL	i had to boot windows once in secure mode... after that i didn't have anymoire
2005-11-05T16:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	private_meta	you do not have anymoare what?
2005-11-05T16:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	private_meta	grub? win? ubuntu?
2005-11-05T16:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	private_meta	boot with a liveCD (of ubuntu) and do a chroot then reinstall grub
2005-11-05T16:21:00.000Z	private_meta	erUSUL	grub works afaik... the problem is the boot of ubuntu itself
2005-11-05T16:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	private_meta	what are the errors?
2005-11-05T16:22:00.000Z	private_meta	erUSUL	there are no errors...
2005-11-05T16:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	private_meta	win should not have touched your linux partitions is weird
2005-11-05T16:23:00.000Z	private_meta	erUSUL	i know it shouldn't... and i doubt it had... but you can never trust windows...
2005-11-05T16:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	private_meta	well whithout any clue of what is broken i can not help. boot with a livecd and take a look at the partition with ubuntu for any clue
2005-11-05T16:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	private_meta	yes
2005-11-05T16:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	private_meta	cafuego said you can boot the install cd in rescue mode typing 'rescue' at boot: promt try that too...
2006-04-08T08:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	private_meta	you need a corresponding cue file to burn it (well to convert it to iso and then burn it) using bchunk
2006-04-08T08:18:00.000Z	private_meta	erUSUL	how do i convert it?
2006-04-08T08:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	private_meta	then use bchunt (sudo apt-get install bchunt) to convert it to an iso file
2006-04-08T08:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	private_meta	man bchunt ;)
2006-04-08T08:19:00.000Z	private_meta	erUSUL	apt-get couldn'T find bchunt for me
2006-04-08T08:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	private_meta	is bchunk
2006-04-08T08:24:00.000Z	private_meta	erUSUL	thxs for now :)
