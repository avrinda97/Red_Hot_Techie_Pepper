2007-02-15T14:48:00.000Z	mwe	dromer	perl is already installed
2007-02-15T14:49:00.000Z	dromer	mwe	ok, but (I'm reading Learning Perl 3rd) when I do $ ./hello_world (first program ;) ) nothing happens ..
2007-02-15T14:50:00.000Z	dromer	mwe	or specifically, this happens: bash: ./hello_world: /url/bin/perl: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
2007-02-15T14:50:00.000Z	mwe	dromer	oh
2007-02-15T14:50:00.000Z	mwe	dromer	odd. perl should be install. try dpkg -l|grep perl
2007-02-15T14:51:00.000Z	mwe	dromer	and dpkg -l perl. isn't it there?

2007-02-15T14:53:00.000Z	mwe	dromer	perl -e 'print "hello\n"'
