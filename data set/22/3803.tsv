2011-06-08T23:27:00.000Z	julie	meco	ps -edalf please
2011-06-08T23:27:00.000Z	julie	meco	but a top output would be nice
2011-06-08T23:29:00.000Z	julie	meco	"top -b"
2011-06-08T23:32:00.000Z	meco	julie	:ok
2011-06-08T23:35:00.000Z	meco	julie	http://pastebin.com/SJex6c15
2011-06-08T23:37:00.000Z	julie	meco	your system is swapping like hell
2011-06-08T23:37:00.000Z	julie	meco	this means you should open less windows/programs or add more RAM
2011-06-08T23:38:00.000Z	meco	julie	Well, I have 494MB but I'm only running Firefox, currently with two tabs and no flash...
2011-06-08T23:39:00.000Z	julie	meco	your firefox alone uses un  800MB
2011-06-08T23:40:00.000Z	julie	meco	if you don't increase your swap space, your system is actually at risk of running out of memory
2011-06-08T23:41:00.000Z	julie	meco	it could be related on the pages you have opened in Firefox
2011-06-08T23:41:00.000Z	meco	julie	Can I allocate more for swap easily?
2011-06-08T23:41:00.000Z	julie	meco	well do you have spare space on your drive?
2011-06-08T23:42:00.000Z	meco	julie	Wel,, I run Ubuntu on a 10GB partition, so there's only about 2.5 GB free right now
2011-06-08T23:44:00.000Z	julie	meco	well you could add another 512MB of swap easily with: dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1048576 count=512; mkswap /swapfile; swapon /swapfile
2011-06-08T23:44:00.000Z	meco	julie	Would that be permanent with that command?
2011-06-08T23:45:00.000Z	julie	meco	if you wish to make it permanent, just add another entry in /etc/fstab with the new swapfile (copy the current)
2011-06-08T23:49:00.000Z	meco	julie	I got '/swapfile: Permission denied' and 'swapon: /swapfile: read swap header failed: Invalid argument'
2011-06-08T23:49:00.000Z	julie	meco	use sudo in front of each command then, or run everything as root
2011-06-08T23:50:00.000Z	julie	meco	if you run it as root yes, otherwise do them one by one with sudo (commands are seperated by ";"
2011-06-08T23:53:00.000Z	julie	meco	I'm glad it works, that should help a bit
