2006-07-27T06:29:00.000Z	ardchoille		Is it possible to remove the Reboot and Shutdown buttons from the logout dialog?
2006-07-27T06:29:00.000Z	drbreen	ardchoille	yeah
2006-07-27T06:29:00.000Z	drbreen	ardchoille	you can lockdown
2006-07-27T06:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	drbreen	How would I go about learning how to do that? Is there an app or tutorial that teaches how to "lockdown"?
2006-07-27T06:32:00.000Z	drbreen	ardchoille	i am sorry i could only find "disable command line" / "disbale printing" and teh like
2006-07-27T06:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	drbreen	ok, well my other users can't use sudo or su, so I have taken care of that.
2006-07-27T06:33:00.000Z	drbreen	ardchoille	what do you want exactly - when they cannot shutdown in my experience there is not button like shutdon...
2006-07-27T06:34:00.000Z	drbreen	ardchoille	i have some small ltsp inet cafe and the users cannot shut down the server (of course). but there is no shutdown option in the logout confirm dialog.
2006-07-27T06:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	drbreen	I just logged out on this box, logged into one of the user accounts and there are Reboot and Shutdown buttons on their logout dialogs. I'd like to remove those buttons so the other users can't click them by mistake.
2006-07-27T06:37:00.000Z	drbreen	ardchoille	understandable - but i assume they dont have the right lo logout, so what happens when they accidentally click one of those buttons ?
2006-07-27T06:37:00.000Z	ardchoille	drbreen	Well, I logged out of the user account and back into my account, so it still works
2006-07-27T06:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	drbreen	Oh, I misunderstood, sorry. I'll try using Reboot or Shurdown from that account and see what happens. Thanks for the idea :)
2006-08-15T07:36:00.000Z	drbreen	ardchoille	you know a decent gdm greeter theme xml tutorial ?
2006-08-15T07:37:00.000Z	ardchoille	drbreen	No, sorry. I wish there was a gdm theme designer
2006-08-15T07:37:00.000Z	drbreen	ardchoille	i wish too
2006-08-15T07:37:00.000Z	ardchoille	drbreen	Are you good with xml?
2006-08-15T07:38:00.000Z	drbreen	ardchoille	i suppose no. but i managed to build my gdm theme...
2006-08-15T07:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	drbreen	I just take apart other themes, mix and match, edit the xml file in gedit and repackage. I hear that is what most people do anyway
2006-08-15T07:39:00.000Z	drbreen	ardchoille	yeah, me too
2006-08-15T07:41:00.000Z	drbreen	ardchoille	do you know a lightweight html WYSIWYG / WYSIWYM editor that i could use if i really badly wanted a "gdm greeter designer" ?
2006-08-15T07:44:00.000Z	ardchoille	drbreen	No, I do all xml/html/python/perl editing in vim
2006-08-15T07:44:00.000Z	drbreen	ardchoille	i use gedit, so i am the noob (:
