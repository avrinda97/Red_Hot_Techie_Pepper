2005-02-03T09:03:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		well, i have directories, not folders.
2005-02-03T09:04:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		good one daniels.
2005-02-03T09:04:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		that gave me a chuckle.
2005-02-03T09:04:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		that directory you mean.
2005-02-03T09:04:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		i thought daniels's comment was genuinely funny.
2005-02-03T09:05:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		i wasn't mocking him.
2005-02-03T09:05:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		well we're not in windows now are we?
2005-02-03T09:06:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		in any case, it seems like gvm is a pretty new thing yeah?  so it will probably be a lot more customizable in the future?
2005-02-03T09:07:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		i have obsessive compulsive order.
2005-02-03T09:08:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		:-) great you jerk.
2005-02-03T09:08:00.000Z	Demitar	BROKEN_LADDER	yes, that felt much better. ;)
2005-02-03T16:21:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	Demitar	oh..handy.
2005-02-03T16:25:00.000Z	Demitar	BROKEN_LADDER	er? You mean /etc/skel?
2005-02-03T16:26:00.000Z	Demitar	BROKEN_LADDER	how about, say, /etc/skel?
2005-02-03T16:27:00.000Z	Demitar	BROKEN_LADDER	check /etc/adduser.conf
2005-02-03T16:27:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	Demitar	you're perhaps the biggest genius in this place.
2005-02-03T16:30:00.000Z	Demitar	BROKEN_LADDER	remember what we said about being friendly and the code of conduct earlier?
2005-02-03T16:31:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	Demitar	i thanked you sincerely for the help.
2005-02-03T16:36:00.000Z	Demitar	BROKEN_LADDER	as we concluded earlier, it won't. The first time you log in as a gnome user gnome will supply those defaults (most likely it doesn't install anything, only uses the defaults).
2005-02-03T16:37:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	Demitar	where are those defaults defined?
2005-02-03T16:38:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	Demitar	that's what i'm looking for.
2005-02-03T16:38:00.000Z	Demitar	BROKEN_LADDER	I suspect it's all gconf /etc/gconf/ ...
