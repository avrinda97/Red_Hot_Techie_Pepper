2007-06-29T14:52:00.000Z	mattycoze		where do i put the password?
2007-06-29T14:53:00.000Z	mattycoze		oh mmm
2007-06-29T14:53:00.000Z	mattycoze		in an ideal world we all wouldn't be
2007-06-29T14:55:00.000Z	mattycoze		true, i can already access my Ubuntu box via XP
2007-06-29T14:55:00.000Z	mattycoze		and i've turned all firewalls off too
2007-06-29T14:56:00.000Z	umop	mattycoze	sudo mount //192.168.0.1/linux /media/sharename/ -o username=myusername,password=mypassword,dmask=777,fmask=777
2007-06-29T14:56:00.000Z	umop	mattycoze	the first address is what you are mounting, second is where you are mountiing to
2007-06-29T14:57:00.000Z	mattycoze		okay umop - i'll give that a try mate
2007-06-29T14:58:00.000Z	umop	mattycoze	it's a little different if you are doing it from /etc/fstab and i can show you that as well if you need it
2007-06-29T15:00:00.000Z	mattycoze		umop; http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/27742/
2007-06-29T15:00:00.000Z	mattycoze		mmm i did something wrong
2007-06-29T15:02:00.000Z	mattycoze	umop	i dunno what the /linux was doing there so i left it
2007-06-29T15:03:00.000Z	umop	mattycoze	the /linux is the directory on that ip address you want to mount, maybe just leave it off and see what happens
2007-06-29T15:03:00.000Z	umop		like it could be /music
2007-06-29T15:03:00.000Z	mattycoze		oh okay lol
2007-06-29T15:04:00.000Z	mattycoze		umop; same error
2007-06-29T15:07:00.000Z	umop	mattycoze	are you mounting a directory that is actually shared? (the /whatever needs to be shared by the sindows box)
2007-06-29T15:07:00.000Z	umop	mattycoze	maybe also create a directory inside /home/Nakarath/ just so we know permissions arn't a problem
2007-06-29T15:09:00.000Z	mattycoze	umop	- shit you're right that's meant to be /home/mattycoze/Nakarath; but i get this now http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/27745/
2007-06-29T15:09:00.000Z	mattycoze		sorry for my stupidity
2007-06-29T15:12:00.000Z	umop	mattycoze	not sure, that means it thinks your password is wrong, or the directory you're trying to mount doesn't exist
2007-06-29T15:25:00.000Z	mattycoze	umop	how come i can't just type in the address of the other computer and access it like that?
