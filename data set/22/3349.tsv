2008-10-03T03:11:00.000Z	Guest83612		can anyone help me?
2008-10-03T03:12:00.000Z	LjL	Guest83612	you can use a text-mode browser, try w3m or links2 or lynx
2008-10-03T03:13:00.000Z	Guest83612	LjL	it ddn't work i didn't get the page
2008-10-03T03:14:00.000Z	LjL	Guest83612	well if you didn't get your network's page, that would be your network's fault i suppose
2008-10-03T03:14:00.000Z	LjL	Guest83612	you do have to load those browsers using "browsername http://some/web/page" for them to show anything, of course.
2008-10-03T03:16:00.000Z	Guest83612	LjL	yeah i suppose but do you know how to install packages from cdrom cause i don;t really need the internet after i get a bare gui
2008-10-03T03:16:00.000Z	LjL	Guest83612	the very same way you'd install from the internet, "sudo apt-get install <packagename>". i suggest a "sudo apt-get update" first.
2008-10-03T03:17:00.000Z	Guest83612	LjL	yeah i tried that cause i figured it would be the same but it couldn't find the packages
2008-10-03T03:17:00.000Z	LjL	Guest83612	then they're not available on the cd, i suppose
2008-10-03T03:18:00.000Z	LjL	Guest83612	show me your sources.list
2008-10-03T03:19:00.000Z	Guest83612	LjL	sorry total noob with the command line cause gedit isn't installed by default so i do know how to open the sources.list file
2008-10-03T03:19:00.000Z	LjL	Guest83612	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-10-03T03:19:00.000Z	LjL	Guest83612	check if the first line is actually the desktop cd line
2008-10-03T03:20:00.000Z	Guest83612	LjL	that worked
2008-10-03T03:20:00.000Z	Guest83612	LjL	yes it is the cd
2008-10-03T03:20:00.000Z	LjL	Guest83612	then you're simply looking to install packages that aren't on the cd (or, did you actually remember to type "sudo apt-get update" too?)
2008-10-03T03:21:00.000Z	Guest83612	LjL	when i did the sudo apt-get update all the online repositories failed (as to be expected) but it should have updatd to the cd
2008-10-03T03:22:00.000Z	LjL	Guest83612	uhm, yeah it should, but perhaps comment out all the non-cd lines from sources.list and then try again
2008-10-03T03:23:00.000Z	Guest83612	LjL	the comment is the # symbol right?
2008-10-03T03:23:00.000Z	LjL	Guest83612	mind finding a more original nickname by the way? this one gets in the way of my nick completion :P
2008-10-03T03:25:00.000Z	Guest83612	LjL	yeah i had a nick but it failed for some reason and diverted to this i'll have to restart my chatzill ato get it back
2008-10-03T03:26:00.000Z	LjL	Guest83612	yeah (although of course that won't get you any real GUI, just the x server)
