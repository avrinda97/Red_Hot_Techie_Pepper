2008-04-10T10:20:00.000Z	bidget		when does hardy come out?
2008-04-10T10:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bidget	tentatively the 24th.
2008-04-10T10:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bidget	just use the path to the script as the command.
2008-04-10T10:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bidget	(and make sure the script is set as executable)
2008-04-10T10:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bidget	yes, you will likely need to edit the permissions.
2008-04-10T10:26:00.000Z	bidget	tonyyarusso	do I want my launcher to be application or application in terminal?
2008-04-10T10:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bidget	depends - what's it do?
2008-04-10T10:26:00.000Z	bidget	tonyyarusso	well I have a script that opens up steam
2008-04-10T10:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bidget	does it require any input on the terminal when running?
2008-04-10T10:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bidget	Does it require _interactive_ input rather, as in you typing things.
2008-04-10T10:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bidget	then regular app should be fine.
2008-04-10T10:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bidget	yeah - click the current one in the edit launcher thingy
2008-04-10T10:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bidget	in the same window where you specified the type and the command, the icon in the upper left - clicking it will let you browse for a new one.
