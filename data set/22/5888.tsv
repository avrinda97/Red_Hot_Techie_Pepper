2007-02-12T14:00:00.000Z	illriginal		Can someone PLEASE help me with Azureus... or recommend me a BETTER Torrent Program?!
2007-02-12T14:00:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	your az shuts down immediately>
2007-02-12T14:01:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	well lemme see if it keeps a log file somewheres... or maybe java does... how do other java apps work for you?
2007-02-12T14:02:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	you have any other java apps to try?  oh, i am not sure i have tried java 6
2007-02-12T14:03:00.000Z	illriginal	mojo	i dont think i have any to begin with.. only azureus
2007-02-12T14:04:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	I am using Java 1.5.0_08  Sun Microsystems Inc. SWT v3318, gtk Linux v2.6.17-10-386, i386
2007-02-12T14:05:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	how about frostwire (or limewire)... they run on java
2007-02-12T14:06:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	well let me see i'll peek in the /opt/azureus and /var/log to see if az logs anything
2007-02-12T14:06:00.000Z	illriginal	mojo	im using: Blackdown Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition, Java runtime environment using GIJ, ok
2007-02-12T14:07:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	hmm.. don't know how azureus works with blackdown... but it could be your problem.  just wild guessing though.  there is a command, i forget, to choose which java... hmm..
2007-02-12T14:10:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	look in /opt/azureus and see if you have any hs_err_pidXXXX.log files - if you do that might give clues
2007-02-12T14:12:00.000Z	illriginal	mojo	lol i can't find it.
2007-02-12T14:12:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	you may google azureus and blackdown to see if others have mentioned problems with the two...
2007-02-12T14:13:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	well then that just means none were created... it appears to be a crash log from "hot spot java" whatever that is.
2007-02-12T14:14:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	i can't find any log files for java either
2007-02-12T14:20:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	well did googling up blackdown and azureus come up with anything?
2007-02-12T14:20:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	that is a good place to start...  i couldn't find where java logs errors, though even if i did i have sun java so it might not be the same place for you
2007-02-12T14:23:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	so you don't have any java runtime environment installed?  you need one, as azureus is a java application.  How you starting azureus?  from the command line?
2007-02-12T14:24:00.000Z	illriginal	mojo	i just installed the lastest one.
2007-02-12T14:24:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	are you running azureus from an icon or menu entry, or from a command line?
2007-02-12T14:24:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	try it from a command line, you may get usefull feedback
2007-02-12T14:28:00.000Z	mojo	illriginal	latest & "greatest" or not, it is possible that Azureus doesn't like it.  It is at least one variable you can control to help diagnose your problem.  it is the scientific method, man
