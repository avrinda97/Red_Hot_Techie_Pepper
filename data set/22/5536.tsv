2007-04-20T16:39:00.000Z	LjL	magnetron	thank you, but i know about the Alternate CD, and i knowthe one that was spammed is not the right URL for it
2007-04-20T16:39:00.000Z	magnetron	LjL	sorry
2007-06-05T15:37:00.000Z	LjL	magnetron	not really. the filesystem merely puts files in places that are statistically unlikely to cause painful fragmentation
2007-10-15T14:38:00.000Z	LjL	magnetron	vmware does, i bet the others can too, except perhaps the open source version of virtualbox might not, since it has some limitations with regard to connections
2007-10-15T14:41:00.000Z	magnetron	LjL	ty
2007-12-01T06:15:00.000Z	magnetron	LjL	EUCD is a directive and not a law
2007-12-01T06:16:00.000Z	LjL	magnetron	as a directive, countries must implement it as a law. some might not have done so yet, and others may have interpreted it more liberally, but the fact remains that it applies in a few of them.
2007-12-01T06:19:00.000Z	magnetron	LjL	the implementation differs greatly between countries. as an example, the Swedish implementation allows you to circumvent copy protection if it's necessary for legal access to your media. (watching your dvds with libdvdcss2 etc)
2007-12-01T06:19:00.000Z	LjL	magnetron	i don't think i've said *all* EU countries make it illegal.

2008-10-15T22:53:00.000Z	LjL	magnetron	i'd try pwgen for a start
2008-10-16T19:06:00.000Z	LjL	magnetron	fail
2008-10-16T19:06:00.000Z	magnetron	LjL	i'll get back to my cave
