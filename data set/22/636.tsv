2011-06-09T08:57:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	celthunder	that's /etc/mail/sendmail.cf?
2011-06-09T09:03:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	celthunder	that's /etc/mail/sendmail.cf? I don't have a "main.cf"...
2011-06-09T09:03:00.000Z	celthunder	chazz_tsc1	sure
2011-06-09T09:03:00.000Z	celthunder	chazz_tsc1	i usually do postfix sorry
2011-06-09T09:08:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	celthunder	here's the cf file... http://pastebin.com/WnKUaTEW
2011-06-09T09:17:00.000Z	celthunder	chazz_tsc1	ok looking at your pastebin now sorry kind of skipped by me before
2011-06-09T09:17:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	celthunder	np a busy night for you
2011-06-09T09:20:00.000Z	celthunder	chazz_tsc1	you set on using sendmail? if you switch to postfix i can help you out i'm trying to google for the sendmail equiv of the line i use
2011-06-09T09:23:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	celthunder	the line won't be usable if you find it in sendmail.cf. See http://pastebin.com/bJVscv0G for the MC file
2011-06-09T09:31:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	celthunder	ubentobox: back. U': it's odd that you don't have an xorg.comf; that seems to be the main control file for the entire x system.
2011-06-09T09:32:00.000Z	celthunder	chazz_tsc1	no it's not xorg.conf mostly isn't needed anymore
2011-06-09T09:44:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	celthunder	- did you see my last pastebin?
2011-06-09T09:58:00.000Z	celthunder	chazz_tsc1	http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.mail.postfix.user/212363 doe that help some
2011-06-09T09:58:00.000Z	celthunder	chazz_tsc1	listed in the first post is some stuff about authing for certain network relay for others
2011-06-09T10:03:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	celthunder	translating that back from postfix to sendmail as best I can, it looks like I have already done all of that...
2011-06-09T10:03:00.000Z	celthunder	chazz_tsc1	the first post i think was sendmail
2011-06-09T10:10:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	celthunder	There are some sendmail .cf items in that post but they apply to a very different problem than what I'm getting. My issue is that people are apparently making an end run around my authentication and there doesn't seem to be anything about that in the thread you posted.
2011-06-09T10:12:00.000Z	celthunder	chazz_tsc1	kk sorry idk then :( but yeah enable auth before relay works is what i had to do
2011-06-09T10:13:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	celthunder	That is exactly what I'm doing; I've followed all instructions I can find for enforcing relay only from authusers, and unaths are still getting past. Oh, well... back to the forums, see if anyone chooses to answer...
