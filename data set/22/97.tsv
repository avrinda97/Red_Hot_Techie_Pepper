2012-07-31T00:35:00.000Z	BluesKaj	romy420	intel hda ?
2012-07-31T00:36:00.000Z	romy420	BluesKaj	yes
2012-07-31T00:37:00.000Z	romy420	BluesKaj	i'm sure there is just some config file that needs to be tweaked but i dunno which and how
2012-07-31T00:38:00.000Z	BluesKaj	romy420	 ^
2012-07-31T00:38:00.000Z	romy420	BluesKaj	not me, Resinator needs your help :)
2012-07-31T00:40:00.000Z	BluesKaj	romy420	 he left anyway
2012-07-31T00:42:00.000Z	BluesKaj	romy420	 I already tried to help him unbder a differnt nick , but he doesn't want to help himself .... he just keeps complaining
2012-07-31T00:44:00.000Z	romy420	BluesKaj	i  think he really has a problem that cannot be solved easily. that can be really annoying, if you're new to linux
2012-07-31T00:44:00.000Z	romy420	BluesKaj	unfortunately google was no help at all too
2012-07-31T00:45:00.000Z	BluesKaj	romy420	 I asked him to install pavucontrol , it could have helped him , I think his inputs and outputs aren't set correctly
2012-07-31T00:47:00.000Z	romy420	BluesKaj	one should try this but it did not help me for instance and i  remember having tosearch three days once i had a laptop with intel hda before i found a solution. cant believe that it still is so difficult
2012-07-31T00:49:00.000Z	BluesKaj	romy420	 was it a driver/module problem , do you recall ?
2012-07-31T00:49:00.000Z	romy420	BluesKaj	i had to enter my model and some parameter in an alsa config file .. that was in 2007 or so
2012-07-31T00:52:00.000Z	BluesKaj	romy420	 ok , a while back ..the snd_hda_intel driver /module is very common and was working well , suddenly there seem to be problems with it again
2012-07-31T00:53:00.000Z	romy420	BluesKaj	ok, good to know this. i just wonder how he got kernel 3.5 installed in 20 minutes. is it already in the repos? dont think so
2012-07-31T00:54:00.000Z	BluesKaj	romy420	 unless he's on 12.10
2012-07-31T00:54:00.000Z	romy420	BluesKaj	yeah maybe. i did not check this. then bugs should be expected :)
2012-07-31T00:56:00.000Z	BluesKaj	romy420	 I'm using 12.10 , its using the 3.5 kernel
2012-07-31T00:57:00.000Z	romy420	BluesKaj	is it stable?
2012-07-31T00:58:00.000Z	BluesKaj	romy420	 much more than 12.04 was at alpha 3
2012-07-31T00:59:00.000Z	BluesKaj	romy420	 I'm on kde , but the ubuntu guys will probly agree with me
2012-07-31T01:00:00.000Z	romy420	BluesKaj	good to know. though i have worked to long to install everything i want to try an upgrade o-O
