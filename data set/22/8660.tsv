2008-01-26T04:19:00.000Z	pavan		hi all.. i am having trouble getting Java working in firefox.. can someone please help
2008-01-26T04:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	pavan	install sun-java6-plugin
2008-01-26T04:21:00.000Z	pavan	erUSUL	what i am to expect with your command..
2008-01-26T04:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	pavan	if you have version 5 use sun-java5-plugin
2008-01-26T04:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	pavan	is a package not a command sudo apt-get install sun-java5-plugin  that will install the firefox (mozilla) java plugin
2008-01-26T04:22:00.000Z	pavan	erUSUL	i just searched for the plugin package in synaptic.. but don't find anything..
2008-01-26T04:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	pavan	is there in multiverse
2008-01-26T04:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	pavan	go to system>admin>software sources and make sure you have multiverse enabled
2008-01-26T04:25:00.000Z	pavan	erUSUL	yes i have multivers enables in s/w sources ..
2008-01-26T04:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	pavan	then just «sudo apt-get install sun-java5-plugin»
2008-01-26T04:26:00.000Z	pavan	erUSUL	i just tried that and got apt-get error that the package is missing or obsolete .. would this be because i am on AMD64 laptop??
2008-01-26T04:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	pavan	oops yes no firefox plugin for the 64 bits version
2008-01-26T04:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	pavan	:(
2008-01-26T04:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	pavan	i use 64 bits myself
2008-01-26T04:27:00.000Z	pavan	erUSUL	i have also installed Swiftweasel
2008-01-26T04:31:00.000Z	pavan	erUSUL	have you tried SwiftWeasel browser.. i was able to get 32bit flash working on it.. i didn't realize i had trouble with java
2008-01-26T04:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	pavan	no; the package flashplugin-nonfree configured flash for firefox64 bits without problems (that was before it broke)
2008-01-26T04:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	pavan	and i do not use java applets
2008-01-26T04:33:00.000Z	pavan	erUSUL	.. thx for your help..
2008-01-26T04:33:00.000Z	pavan	erUSUL	.. will try & figure this out..
2008-01-26T04:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	pavan	no problem
2008-06-27T14:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	pavan	is a tar archive compressed with gzip. It is like a rar or zip file
