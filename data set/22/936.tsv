2011-01-20T04:17:00.000Z	good_intentions	hermes	nah not with dx10. The main problem is I watch TV on the computer. And I use a payTV card. I cant get it to work in linux at all the only solution was to use a program called sasc-ng but it didnt work
2011-01-20T04:31:00.000Z	hermes	good_intentions	dare I ask that wether u have anything of particular use in your newly installed linux os or a backup drive possibly?
