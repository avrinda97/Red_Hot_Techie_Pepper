2010-05-19T01:20:00.000Z	toughguy		Can any one tell me how to gey my apache to serve from boot and still allow multi user account on ubuntu?
2010-05-19T01:20:00.000Z	toughguy		*get
2010-05-19T01:21:00.000Z	jrib	toughguy	what do you mean by "still allow multi user account on ubuntu"?
2010-05-19T01:22:00.000Z	jrib	toughguy	umm, how are you running apache?
2010-05-19T01:23:00.000Z	jrib	toughguy	please don't be vague.  Did you install apache through the repositories?
2010-05-19T01:24:00.000Z	jrib	toughguy	"websites onle seem to work if I log into my account"?  What does that mean?  What exactly doesn't work?  Where are the files being stored exactly?  Is your home encrypted?
2010-05-19T01:25:00.000Z	toughguy	jrib	If I log into the account I set them up in I can restart my apache and they are live. but once someone else logs into their account they stop working
2010-05-19T01:25:00.000Z	jrib	toughguy	and the other questions I asked?
2010-05-19T01:25:00.000Z	toughguy	jrib	/var/www
2010-05-19T01:25:00.000Z	jrib	toughguy	and I don't know what "set them up in" means
2010-05-19T01:26:00.000Z	toughguy	jrib	my home is default settings, I don't know if that is encrypted
2010-05-19T01:27:00.000Z	toughguy	jrib	the login I used to access ubuntu
2010-05-19T01:27:00.000Z	jrib	toughguy	what does "set them up in" mean?
2010-05-19T01:27:00.000Z	toughguy	jrib	are you trying to be unhelpful
2010-05-19T01:28:00.000Z	toughguy	jrib	I am just trying to get some sites woring in apache in a multi user environment, surely this is not the first time it's been done
2010-05-19T01:29:00.000Z	jrib	toughguy	no, I am asking questions so I can actually understand what is happening.  I am not there with you.  The questions I ask are because you are saying things that are clear to you, but I am not standing next to you. Avoid using ambiguous pronouns
2010-05-19T01:30:00.000Z	jrib	toughguy	yes, apache is usually completely unrelated to your user logging in.  My only guess was that you had files in your home and it was encrypted.  You've ruled that out however.  Thus my other questions.
2010-05-19T01:32:00.000Z	jrib	toughguy	you need to determine if your home is encrypted
2010-05-19T01:32:00.000Z	jrib	toughguy	(I'm not sure how offhand)
2010-05-19T01:32:00.000Z	toughguy	jrib	should it be
2010-05-19T01:32:00.000Z	jrib	toughguy	it's a choice at install
2010-05-19T01:34:00.000Z	toughguy	jrib	I don't believe it is, sorry for being short I have pnumonia at the moment and it's made me crabby, laters
