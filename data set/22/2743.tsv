2009-03-21T21:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	massie	of course
2009-03-21T21:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	massie	yep that, but be careful not to delete part of your system if doing that.  then just right cilck on the thing and go to permissions and change them
2009-03-21T21:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	massie	ha ha no, this is not Windows
2009-03-21T21:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	massie	you only re boot for major changes such as a new kernel
2009-03-21T21:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	massie	heh
2009-03-21T21:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	massie	 ok uhmmm what are you trying to do exactly?
2009-03-21T21:23:00.000Z	massie	sebsebseb	- ok. i formatted my 2nd HD and formatted it as ext3. i need to allow it to read/write data, as it's my backup drive
2009-03-21T21:24:00.000Z	massie	sebsebseb	- but when i try to copy/paste anything, no such luck allowing it. it's owned by root apparently
2009-03-21T21:24:00.000Z	massie	sebsebseb	- even though i changed permissions in nautilus
2009-03-21T21:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	massie	yes gksudo nautilus it and change to you as the user and put you in the group as well
2009-03-21T21:26:00.000Z	massie	sebsebseb	- ok. now, i set user as my username in nautilus, exited, no changes
2009-03-21T21:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	massie	get my pm?
