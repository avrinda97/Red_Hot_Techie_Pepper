2012-07-11T19:38:00.000Z	mneptok	ra4king	you'll probably also want "dns-search" and "dns-domains" entries in the interfaces file, too.
2012-07-11T19:38:00.000Z	ra4king	mneptok	?
2012-07-11T19:38:00.000Z	ra4king	mneptok	what would I put for those?
2012-07-11T19:38:00.000Z	mneptok	ra4king	same as the "dns-servers" entry
2012-07-11T19:39:00.000Z	mneptok	ra4king	err ... dns-nameservers
2012-07-11T19:39:00.000Z	ra4king	mneptok	well...things work without it.....so I'm not gonna bother putting them
2012-07-11T19:39:00.000Z	mneptok	ra4king	put them in there now, before you forget what they are. just leave them commented out.
2012-07-11T19:40:00.000Z	ra4king	mneptok	forget what? i'm simply using the google dns servers
2012-07-11T19:40:00.000Z	mneptok	ra4king	forget that it is "dns-search" and "dns-domains" that you are missing.
2012-07-11T19:41:00.000Z	ra4king	mneptok	what will happen if I don't put those? O_o
2012-07-11T19:42:00.000Z	mneptok	ra4king	if you end up needing them in the future because of an update or whatever, you prolly won;t remember what i said.
2012-07-11T19:42:00.000Z	ra4king	mneptok	ah
2012-07-11T19:42:00.000Z	ra4king	mneptok	ok so do I put dns-search 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
2012-07-11T19:42:00.000Z	mneptok	ra4king	so add the lines, but comment them out if you feel you do not need them.
2012-07-11T19:42:00.000Z	ra4king	mneptok	is that what I do though?
2012-07-11T19:42:00.000Z	mneptok	ra4king	if/when DNS goes wonky, go uncomment them, restart networking, and hope your karma is good. :)
2012-07-11T19:43:00.000Z	ra4king	mneptok	googling around, it seems dns-nameservers is the only thing I need
2012-07-11T19:43:00.000Z	mneptok	ra4king	http://www.stgraber.org/2012/02/24/dns-in-ubuntu-12-04/  <--- that's from a coredev. :)
2012-07-11T19:44:00.000Z	mneptok	ra4king	and apparently i messed up by pluralizing "dns-domains"
2012-07-11T19:44:00.000Z	mneptok	ra4king	just "dns-domain"
2012-07-11T19:45:00.000Z	ra4king	mneptok	now, it doesn't say what to put for dns-search and dns-domain
2012-07-11T19:45:00.000Z	mneptok	ra4king	the GOOG servers you're using for nameservers are fine
