2011-04-12T23:31:00.000Z	brightspark		At the login screen, there is a menu to choose the keyboard layout.  How does one remove unwanted layouts from this?
2011-04-12T23:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brightspark	look in the keyboard settings, there may be a list there
2011-04-12T23:35:00.000Z	brightspark	ActionParsnip	 That doesn't affect the login screen menu.
2011-04-12T23:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brightspark	hmm
2011-04-12T23:38:00.000Z	brightspark	ActionParsnip	 See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-control-center/+bug/530999
2011-12-06T06:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brightspark	could try logoff then logon
2011-12-06T06:07:00.000Z	brightspark	ActionParsnip	thanks.  This has persisted across reboots for some time now.  When I actually open power management it uses the correct icon, but not in the tray.
2011-12-06T06:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brightspark	does it affect all themes?
2011-12-06T06:09:00.000Z	brightspark	ActionParsnip	yes.  I see the icon for the volume control and the logoff/shutdown menu change but not the icons for volume or network.
2011-12-06T06:18:00.000Z	brightspark	ActionParsnip	I just confirmed that the problem persists across logoffs no matter which icon set I am using.
2012-10-22T07:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brightspark	what is the output of: lsb_release -sc
2012-10-22T07:38:00.000Z	brightspark	ActionParsnip	maverick.
2012-10-22T07:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brightspark	maverick is EOL
2012-10-22T07:39:00.000Z	brightspark	ActionParsnip	true.  but this package has been around since the eighties.  I was just surprised that searching "treetex" in aptitude gave me no results.
2012-10-22T07:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brightspark	all the repos for Maverick have been turned off, there are no packages for it. I suggest a fresh install of Precise for LTS goodness, or Quantal for the latest features
2012-10-22T07:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brightspark	yes, you'll get no results as there are no packages
2012-10-22T07:40:00.000Z	brightspark	ActionParsnip	I just installed texlive-plain-extra.
2012-10-22T07:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brightspark	I suggest you upgrade, ideally with a clean install
2012-10-22T07:42:00.000Z	brightspark	ActionParsnip	thanks for the suggestion, but I'm happy with this system.  I tried Unity for a month and it seriously disappointed me- I don't want to have to fight it to use my computer everyday.
2012-10-22T07:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brightspark	you don't have to use Unity
2012-10-22T07:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brightspark	Lubuntu, Xubuntu and Kubuntu do not use Unity. It's not even installed
2012-10-22T07:50:00.000Z	brightspark	ActionParsnip	robertzaccour, thanks for the suggestions; I'll look into them a bit more this week.  Goodnight all
