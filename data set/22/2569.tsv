2012-02-08T21:37:00.000Z	angelete2		hi again
2012-02-08T21:38:00.000Z	angelete2		i have a ubuntu virtualized in my windows box
2012-02-08T21:40:00.000Z	angelete2		both my ubuntu and windows have 2 network adapters, one cable (network .0.0) and wireless(.1.0), virtualized adapters are attached to real devices so they have .1.12 and .0.143 addresses
2012-02-08T21:41:00.000Z	angelete2		my wireless adapter is connected to an access point without internet access, so i reach internet using .0.0 network
2012-02-08T21:42:00.000Z	angelete2		i've connected my ipod to wireless (ip .1.10) and i can ping or tracert .1.12, and have .1.12 as default gateway, but i cannot access internet
2012-02-08T21:42:00.000Z	angelete2		can anyone help me?
2012-02-08T21:42:00.000Z	ikonia	angelete2	what is doing the internet connection sharing
2012-02-08T21:43:00.000Z	angelete2	ikonia	my windows host has the real devices, and i use .0.1 gateway (cable connection)
2012-02-08T21:43:00.000Z	ikonia	angelete2	what is doing the sharing of the internet ?
2012-02-08T21:44:00.000Z	angelete2	ikonia	i think i don't understand what do you mean
2012-02-08T21:44:00.000Z	ikonia	angelete2	what device is connected to the internet ?
2012-02-08T21:45:00.000Z	ikonia	angelete2	so what's the problem
2012-02-08T21:46:00.000Z	angelete2	ikonia	i want my virtualized linux to use as a router, but my wireless devices cannot reach internet
2012-02-08T21:47:00.000Z	ikonia	angelete2	sorry, that makes no sense
2012-02-08T21:47:00.000Z	angelete2	ikonia	this is an schema http://tinypic.com/?t=postupload
2012-02-08T21:49:00.000Z	angelete2	ikonia	i want to virtualize an access point in order to make some tests
2012-02-08T21:49:00.000Z	ikonia	angelete2	that's going to be quite complex
2012-02-08T21:50:00.000Z	angelete2	ikonia	but do you mean what i want? (i want to know if i explained myself right)
2012-02-08T21:54:00.000Z	angelete2	ikonia	is it possible to do what i want?
2012-02-08T21:54:00.000Z	ikonia	angelete2	rather complex but yes
2012-02-08T21:55:00.000Z	ikonia	angelete2	it's not that simple
2012-02-08T21:55:00.000Z	ikonia	angelete2	you are going to need bridged networks, routing, ip forwarding, you're going to need something to address your IP allocation,
