2007-02-23T15:14:00.000Z	fredl		how come dbconfig-common doesn't seem to run on Ubuntu?
2007-02-23T15:15:00.000Z	fredl		So for what the bot DOESN'T seem to know, why dbconfig-common doesn't seem to work properly on Ubuntu, could somebody please help me figure out why it doesn't work?
2007-02-23T15:17:00.000Z	fredl		I have uninstalled/reinstalled dbconfig-common on Edgy, uninstalled/reinstalled packages that use it, and I can't get it to create databases properly.
2007-02-23T15:18:00.000Z	fredl		*sigh*
2007-02-23T15:19:00.000Z	fredl		where's the Ubuntu channel where  you can ask questions other than how to move a file?
2007-02-23T15:20:00.000Z	fredl		it's not offtopic, it's about UBUNTU
2007-02-23T15:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	fredl	right here. Don't ask to ask, just ask...
2007-02-23T15:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	fredl	try again in a while, then - no response generally means nobody has an answer for you.
2007-02-23T15:22:00.000Z	fredl	Madpilot	dbconfig-common gets used in a ton of packages in Ubuntu, how can it be that nobody here can answer a question about it when it *appears* to be broken?
2007-02-23T15:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	fredl	because most of this crowd is composed of desktop users, probably.
2007-02-23T15:23:00.000Z	fredl	Madpilot	well, that's why I asked if there's an Ubuntu channel where I can ask question that are of a slightly higher level than how to move a file.
2007-02-23T15:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	fredl	-classroom because it's quieter, and better for more in-depth help sometimes.
2007-02-23T15:28:00.000Z	fredl	Madpilot	I'm on #ubuntu-server but nobody there is talking at all, nor on #ubuntu-classroom
2007-02-23T15:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	fredl	you might want to try ubuntuforums.org's server forum, if -server is dead and nobody here is up to speed on server issues
2007-02-23T15:30:00.000Z	fredl	Madpilot	but there's 932 people sitting here... *sigh* I relate to that post that CheshireViking pasted...
2007-02-23T15:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	fredl	no, there's about 30 active, and roughly 900 idlers... sad but true.
2007-10-22T12:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	fredl	use the alternate CD, that's got slightly finer control over partiton use than the LIveCD installer
2007-10-22T12:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	fredl	it should. installer has an option for 'use existing partition table'
2007-10-22T12:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	fredl	I've reinstalled over existing partitions - /home is seperate - without issues. Your setup will just take a bit longer to configure, is all.
2007-10-22T12:53:00.000Z	fredl	Madpilot	- you mean you've installed Ubuntu over Debian installs?
2007-10-22T12:53:00.000Z	fredl	Madpilot	or just Ubuntu over another Ubuntu?
2007-10-22T12:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	fredl	newer ubuntu over (messed up) older Ubuntu
