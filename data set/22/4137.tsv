2008-03-08T12:07:00.000Z	zdux00tv_		for a dual boot linux/linux: Where should I set the second mount point? Can they both use the same swap?
2008-03-08T12:07:00.000Z	synth	zdux00tv_	no they cant use the same swap, second mount point?
2008-03-08T12:09:00.000Z	zdux00tv_	synth	Draco, amenado: I just want to make sure the new OS works then I would reformat to having just Ubuntu
2008-03-08T12:10:00.000Z	synth	zdux00tv_	if its 1 hd, then each has its own partition
2008-03-08T12:12:00.000Z	zdux00tv_	synth	Draco, amenado: it's a new laptop, and I don't like the distro it came with (gOS)
2008-03-08T12:18:00.000Z	zdux00tv_	synth	<off topic> start with wtc7, then look into MIT's study of forensic evidence of thermate</off topic>
2008-03-08T12:19:00.000Z	synth	zdux00tv_	please, I can debunk any 9/11 conspiracy shit you can throw at me
2008-03-08T12:19:00.000Z	synth	zdux00tv_	</off topic> :)
2008-03-08T12:20:00.000Z	zdux00tv_	synth	I'm using a text based irc so I can't pm you or receive pm. Debunk this: http://www.journalof911studies.com/articles/WTCHighTemp2.pdf
2008-03-08T12:24:00.000Z	synth	zdux00tv_	ok, one hard drive, and windows/ubuntu?
2008-03-08T12:24:00.000Z	zdux00tv_	synth	it's linux/linux
2008-03-08T12:24:00.000Z	synth	zdux00tv_	on two diff partitions?
2008-03-08T12:24:00.000Z	zdux00tv_	synth	yes 1 hard drive currently with swap and ext
2008-03-08T12:24:00.000Z	synth	zdux00tv_	ok so you wanna dual boot?
2008-03-08T12:25:00.000Z	zdux00tv_	synth	yes, to try out the hardware over time then fully switch to ubuntu
2008-03-08T12:25:00.000Z	synth	zdux00tv_	ok, so edit /boot/grub/menu.lst (back it up first) and duplicate your entries for each partition
2008-03-08T12:26:00.000Z	synth	zdux00tv_	but look in each linux installs' partition to confirm that the kernel you are booting and all the files it wants w/it are there
2008-03-08T12:26:00.000Z	synth	zdux00tv_	basically just compare that files config (the real files it references in it) to the other OS's install and change names where necessary
2008-03-08T12:28:00.000Z	zdux00tv_	synth	ok, thanks
2008-03-08T12:28:00.000Z	zdux00tv_	synth	it looks more complicated than I though
2008-03-08T12:28:00.000Z	synth	zdux00tv_	its very manual but I think if you read the file it is self explanatory
2008-03-08T12:29:00.000Z	zdux00tv_	synth	thanks a bunch
