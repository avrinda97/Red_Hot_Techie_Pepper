2008-07-19T02:03:00.000Z	Stormx2	bobertdos	what's the other option?
2008-07-19T02:04:00.000Z	Stormx2	bobertdos	okay, cause I'm having audio issues with flash 9 too.
2008-07-19T02:04:00.000Z	Stormx2	bobertdos	do you have any install tips for flash 10?
2008-07-19T02:06:00.000Z	Stormx2	bobertdos	okay, cheers
2008-07-19T02:09:00.000Z	Stormx2	bobertdos	not working with amd64...
2008-07-19T02:09:00.000Z	bobertdos	Stormx2	Oh yes, for you it's going to be harder :p
2008-07-19T02:10:00.000Z	bobertdos	Stormx2	Actually, quite tricky unfortunately. Are you familiar with ndispluginwrapper at all?
2008-07-19T02:11:00.000Z	Stormx2	bobertdos	Nope, I'm not.
2008-07-19T02:14:00.000Z	bobertdos	Stormx2	Would you be comfortable following this: http://www.myscienceisbetter.info/2008/05/install-adobe-flash-player-10-on-ubuntu-using-nspluginwrapper.html
2008-07-19T02:18:00.000Z	Stormx2	bobertdos	followed. Still found issues.
2008-07-19T02:18:00.000Z	bobertdos	Stormx2	like?
2008-07-19T02:18:00.000Z	Stormx2	bobertdos	video stops playing after 2 seconds if I have mpd running
2008-07-19T02:20:00.000Z	bobertdos	Stormx2	fair enough, I myself don't use a 64-bit system, so I don't know if I'd be of much more help anyway :p
2008-07-19T02:24:00.000Z	Stormx2	bobertdos	my god. all this time, it was mpd locking the sound card. oh well. at least i have flash 10 now.
2008-07-19T02:26:00.000Z	bobertdos	Stormx2	hahaha, don'cha just hate it when stuff like that happens?? :D Oh  well, have fun! cheers
2008-07-19T02:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	bobertdos	Thanks for all the help
2008-07-19T02:27:00.000Z	bobertdos	Stormx2	My pleasure
2008-10-02T03:24:00.000Z	bobertdos	Stormx2	I assume there's a 64-bit version of build-essential. I would make sure that's installed.
2008-10-02T03:24:00.000Z	Stormx2	bobertdos	build-essential is installed
2008-10-02T03:25:00.000Z	bobertdos	Stormx2	Hmm, I don't know enough about the package structure for 64-bit architecure to suggest anything else, I guess.
2008-10-02T03:27:00.000Z	Stormx2	bobertdos	i've got it, don't worry
2008-10-02T03:27:00.000Z	Stormx2	bobertdos	Basically I needed to remove the -pc bit from the makefile
