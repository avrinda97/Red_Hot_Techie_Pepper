2006-04-02T11:18:00.000Z	crimsun	jon_	I don't know offhand (haven't used urxvt in a long time)
2006-04-02T10:29:00.000Z	crimsun	jon_	it'll help if you enable the deb/deb-src repo for universe, and apt-get build-dep rxvt-unicode
2006-04-02T10:29:00.000Z	crimsun	jon_	note that the perl dependency is a newer one as of v6.x
2006-04-02T10:31:00.000Z	jon_	crimsun	Thanks.
2006-04-02T10:38:00.000Z	jon_	crimsun	If you use xcompmgr, rxvt-unicode has support for terminals with a transparent background yet fully opaque foreground.
2006-04-02T10:38:00.000Z	jon_	crimsun	If you're interested . .
2006-04-02T10:39:00.000Z	crimsun	jon_	yes, I follow upstream development.
2006-04-02T10:39:00.000Z	jon_	crimsun	Damn, same problem.
2006-04-02T10:41:00.000Z	crimsun	jon_	is libperl-dev installed?
2006-04-02T10:45:00.000Z	jon_	crimsun	Thank you, that did it.
2006-04-02T11:12:00.000Z	jon_	crimsun	If you're still there, when I start urxvt with 32 bit depth, xcompmgr doesn't draw shadows for it. Is there a way I can have it do that . .
2006-04-08T06:24:00.000Z	crimsun	jon_	it's NOT an xmms issue.
2006-04-08T06:24:00.000Z	crimsun	jon_	plain n' simple, it's the way ALSA is designed.
2006-04-08T06:25:00.000Z	jon_	crimsun	Ahh wait, ... yeah, isn't it .. if..OSS using..ALSA doesn't work? Hmm =\
2006-04-08T06:26:00.000Z	jon_	crimsun	I thought I saw something on getting flash to work with other apps, (which flash uses OSS)...
2006-04-08T06:26:00.000Z	crimsun	jon_	yes, you can use a wrapper which will force it to use another API, like ESounD or ALSA.
2006-04-08T06:26:00.000Z	jon_	crimsun	Using ESD and a bunch of configing and praying.
2006-04-08T06:26:00.000Z	jon_	crimsun	The last question being, that i'm not sure of, is there a wrapper for that program?
2006-04-08T06:27:00.000Z	crimsun	jon_	esddsp (in esound-clients), artsdsp (in libarts1c2), or aoss (in alsa-oss)
2006-04-08T06:28:00.000Z	jon_	crimsun	So, is there a way to instruct axisys to wrap his program to use esddsp, artsdsp, or aoss?
2006-04-08T06:28:00.000Z	jon_	crimsun	Because, I honestly have no clue, but I always thought you could?..
2006-04-08T06:29:00.000Z	crimsun	jon_	he can try using artsdsp festival, or esddsp festival, or aoss festival
