2009-06-29T03:40:00.000Z	causasui		Too much spam but all right
2009-06-29T03:40:00.000Z	th0r	causasui	if it is too long, pastebin it
2009-06-29T03:40:00.000Z	causasui	th0r	When I try to connect, I get something like "ECONN: Connection refused by server"
2009-06-29T03:41:00.000Z	th0r	causasui	it is a permission thing. Pastebin the conf file
2009-06-29T03:42:00.000Z	causasui	th0r	Ok sec
2009-06-29T03:43:00.000Z	causasui	th0r	I'm having trouble finding it
2009-06-29T03:43:00.000Z	th0r	causasui	I don't have it installed on this box, but it should be in /etc, maybe /etc/pureftp or /etc/pureftpd
2009-06-29T03:44:00.000Z	causasui	th0r	this is really weirdbut neither folder exists. I'm going to reinstall
2009-06-29T03:45:00.000Z	th0r	causasui	are you logging in as anonymous?
2009-06-29T03:45:00.000Z	causasui	th0r	I never even got the chance to log in, it just said connection refused
2009-06-29T03:46:00.000Z	causasui	th0r	It looks to me like it's no longer in the repository. this is baffling
2009-06-29T03:46:00.000Z	th0r	causasui	I found this....see if it helps...http://forums.opensuse.org/archives/sf-archives/archives-network-internet/310208-pure-ftpd-refuses-connections.html
2009-06-29T03:47:00.000Z	th0r	causasui	and on the ftp server check to see if pureftpd is running (ps ax | grep ftp
2009-06-29T03:48:00.000Z	causasui	th0r	the name of the package in the repository has changed, I'm installing the new one
2009-06-29T03:49:00.000Z	th0r	causasui	I have used vsftpd for a long time....pure gave me problems one day and the easiest fix was to switch <smile>
2009-06-29T03:49:00.000Z	causasui	th0r	I couldnt find any good webmin tools for vsftpd
2009-06-29T03:49:00.000Z	th0r	causasui	agreed...but the conf file is easy enough to maintain without them
2009-06-29T03:50:00.000Z	causasui	th0r	I can't do it without a webmin, sorry
