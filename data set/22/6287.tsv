2007-05-08T15:16:00.000Z	soundray	Xpert	yes, you got the wrong CD. You can only run the i386 version in vmware.
2007-05-08T15:17:00.000Z	Xpert	soundray	which one i have to obtain i only saw in site a 6... and 7.04 version
2007-05-08T15:18:00.000Z	soundray	Xpert	the one where the filename ends in i386.iso (the PC version).
2007-05-08T15:19:00.000Z	soundray	Xpert	7.04 is the latest, so pick that.
2007-05-08T15:19:00.000Z	Xpert	soundray	but in download page there are only two...
2007-05-08T15:19:00.000Z	Xpert	soundray	i picked this one!
2007-05-08T15:19:00.000Z	Xpert	soundray	ubuntu-7.04-alternate-amd64
2007-05-08T15:20:00.000Z	soundray	Xpert	look carefully: it ends in amd64, not i386. So you downloaded the wrong one. You can install the amd64 version on your machine, but not in vmware. You would have to set up a dual-boot system with it.
2007-05-08T15:22:00.000Z	Xpert	soundray	a, then i need to obtain the 7.04 but i386 socket right?
2007-05-08T15:22:00.000Z	soundray	Xpert	I don't know what you mean by "socket"
2007-05-08T15:25:00.000Z	Xpert	soundray	but the name of archive has a "desktop" in the middle,.. but i use a notebook .. is there any trouble ?
2007-05-08T15:27:00.000Z	soundray	Xpert	it's not a problem.
2007-05-08T15:27:00.000Z	Xpert	soundray	 =DDD
