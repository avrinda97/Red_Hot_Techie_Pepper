2011-07-07T04:57:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	the above was for you
2011-07-07T05:00:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	what is the output of $ file *.efi
2011-07-07T05:01:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	 no, that is too small.  but the 698 mb figure you quoted was correct.
2011-07-07T05:03:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	the above was for you
2011-07-07T05:04:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	where is the file you said was 698mb?
2011-07-07T05:06:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	can you open a terminal for me?
2011-07-07T05:07:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	press ctrl-alt-t
2011-07-07T05:09:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	or go to applications>accessories>terminal
2011-07-07T05:10:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	not to worry.
2011-07-07T05:11:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	what OS are you currently using?
2011-07-07T05:14:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	oh- i thought you were looking for a file on a Linux system.  What files can you see inside the rar archive?
2011-07-07T05:21:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	those files should be inside the iso file i think.  I'm not sure how to diagnose this on Windows- why don't you just download the actual iso instead of a rar?
2011-07-07T05:24:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	do you know which version of ubuntu you want?
2011-07-07T05:26:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	go to http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download and choose the options you want.
2011-07-07T05:29:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	I would recommend the 10.04 LTS, but make your own choice-- 11.04 has newer features but 10.04 will be supported for longer and has more applications available.
2011-07-07T05:29:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	see above.
2011-07-07T05:31:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	that download will take a while, so don't start right before you need to shutdown.
2011-07-07T05:35:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	the one you want is the 4th one you listed
2011-07-07T05:39:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	it will work fine and is likely to be more compatible with software than the 64bit version.
2011-07-07T05:44:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	not at all stupid questions.  you really ought to be okay- it loads from a cd so you don't need to install to hard disc straightaway.  it will take time to find all the programs you want but in general the menus should be accessible to a computer user.
2011-07-07T05:49:00.000Z	brightspark	dbz2021	not a problem at all.  I hope your download works out fine, but I need to go to bed as I have work tomorrow.  Cheers
