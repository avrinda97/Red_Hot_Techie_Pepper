2009-06-18T14:53:00.000Z	Al__NZ		evening all.
2009-06-18T14:53:00.000Z	Al__NZ		Does ubuntu mount NTFS disks/partitions automatically?
2009-06-18T14:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	Al__NZ	yes (not at boot when you access them)
2009-06-18T14:54:00.000Z	Al__NZ	erUSUL	interesting. I was trying to look at a drive in Gnome, but had to manually issue the commands in terminal to get it to mount?
2009-06-18T14:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Al__NZ	no idea what may be heppening Works for many people as is... but add cases and bugs happen
2009-06-18T14:55:00.000Z	Al__NZ	erUSUL	yeah the drive is dodgy - that could have something to do with ti
2009-06-18T14:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	Al__NZ	could be that it does not get properly identified
2009-06-18T15:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	Al__NZ	the former; the same size as the drive/partition
2009-06-18T15:07:00.000Z	Al__NZ	erUSUL	so if I want to ddrescue a small 10g disk to my 100gig disk that my ubunut boots off I so far have : sudo ddrescue -v /dev/sdb /dev/sda - but of course I dont want to write the output file to my working dev/sda/ - do I need to specify a file or dir on sda?
2009-06-18T15:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	Al__NZ	NO!
2009-06-18T15:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	Al__NZ	sudo ddrescue -v /dev/sdb somefile_on_your_good_disk
2009-06-18T15:08:00.000Z	Al__NZ	erUSUL	and that file must first exist??
2009-06-18T15:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	Al__NZ	no; it will be created... i do not have ddrescue installed check its man page for the details
2009-06-18T15:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	Al__NZ	if you did sudo ddrescue -v /dev/sdb /dev/sda you will be ruining the good disk...
2009-06-18T15:11:00.000Z	Al__NZ	erUSUL	So i could sudo ddrescue -v /dev/sdb /dev/sda/testrescue ?
2009-06-18T15:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Al__NZ	no; sudo ddrescue -v /dev/sdb /home/$USER/testrescue.img for example (that will save the image in your home folder with an informative extension)
2009-06-18T15:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Al__NZ	/dev/sd** are espcial files only used for very special operations
2009-06-19T00:48:00.000Z	Al__NZ	erUSUL	what was the place you said to write a ddrescue file now that I have reinstalled? /home/$user something?
2009-06-19T00:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	Al__NZ	/home/$USER/hard_disk.img <<< hard_disk.img it is just a random name you can choose whatever you choose
2009-06-19T00:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	Al__NZ	no problem
2009-06-19T01:04:00.000Z	Al__NZ	erUSUL	boy dd is slow - shes gonna take a while!!!!
2009-06-19T01:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	Al__NZ	yes... maybe you gain some velocity if you tweak bs parameter... not sure if ddrescue support it though (normal dd does)
