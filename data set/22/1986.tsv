2009-11-13T23:54:00.000Z	Znupi	Dr_Willis	what about linux-linux sharing?
2009-11-13T23:54:00.000Z	Znupi	Dr_Willis	is there an alternative to samba?
2009-11-13T23:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Znupi	 nfs, sshfs, samba, or other ways
2009-11-13T23:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Znupi	 4+ other ways
2009-11-13T23:55:00.000Z	Znupi	Dr_Willis	I know about sshfs, but that usually makes you share everything, it's hard to just share one-two folders
2009-11-13T23:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Znupi	 err.. sshfs can mount specific directories/paths.. not eveyrthing
2009-11-13T23:56:00.000Z	Znupi	Dr_Willis	yes, you can mount a specific directory from a client, but from a "host", you can't share *just* a folder
2009-11-13T23:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Znupi	 sshfs just mounts. :) its not really doing the shareing.. ssh is the shareing part.
2009-11-13T23:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Znupi	 normal linux permissions are used  i belive
2009-11-13T23:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Znupi	 same as if they were logged in locally
2009-11-13T23:58:00.000Z	Znupi	Dr_Willis	Yes, but still, it's not easy to set up, like samba
2009-11-13T23:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Znupi	 err.. comapred to samba.. its much easier.
2009-11-13T23:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Znupi	 but it wont work with windows machines. :)
2009-11-13T23:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Znupi	 and some times that even works..  ive had mixxed results
2009-11-14T00:00:00.000Z	Znupi	Dr_Willis	it always worked for me
2009-11-14T00:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Znupi	 i always set up samba to share the users HOME directories. so theres rarely a need for more specific shares being made by uisers
2009-11-14T00:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Znupi	 theres MUCH more to samba - then just right clicking.. :) thats just one little facet of the fetures it can do.
2009-11-14T00:03:00.000Z	Znupi	Dr_Willis	What I'm saying is that for a novice user (noob), sharing files can be very problematic on a Linux system (like Ubuntu), although the task itself is basic and most of them would go "right clicking worked on windows!"
2009-11-14T00:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Znupi	 and its amazing how many of them never even look in the menus for the share thing. :)
2009-11-14T00:04:00.000Z	Znupi	Dr_Willis	That's why I said an open source software similar to samba should be developed
2009-11-14T00:05:00.000Z	Znupi	Dr_Willis	there's WinSCP if you really want to do ssh file sharing on windows
2009-11-14T00:07:00.000Z	Znupi	Dr_Willis	heh, me too
