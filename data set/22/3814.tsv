2008-06-11T02:59:00.000Z	anirudh0	iDN	you'll need to mount manually..then edit mountpoint
2008-06-11T03:08:00.000Z	anirudh0	iDN	post sudo fdisk -l
2008-06-11T03:09:00.000Z	iDN	anirudh0	http://paste.ubuntu.com/19156/
2008-06-11T03:10:00.000Z	anirudh0	iDN	since i did'nt follow your earlier conversion, i'd request  you to repeat which drive the error is about
2008-06-11T03:11:00.000Z	anirudh0	iDN	pugin you sansa..then run ls /dev/sd*
2008-06-11T03:12:00.000Z	iDN	anirudh0	A Sansa Clip (works with MSC), 2GB, /dev/sdb
2008-06-11T03:12:00.000Z	anirudh0	iDN	sudo mount -vt auto /dev/sdb1 <mountpoint>
2008-06-11T03:12:00.000Z	anirudh0	iDN	has to be sdb1
2008-06-11T03:13:00.000Z	iDN	anirudh0	"ls" - /dev/sda  /dev/sda1  /dev/sda2  /dev/sda5  /dev/sda6  /dev/sdb
2008-06-11T03:14:00.000Z	iDN	anirudh0	sudo mount -vt ::: you didn't specify a filesystem type for /dev/sdb1. I will try all types mentioned in /etc/filesystems or /proc/filesystems; Trying fuseblk; mount: special device /dev/sdb1 does not exist
2008-06-11T03:15:00.000Z	iDN	anirudh0	It's sdb, actually. No 1 in the name.
2008-06-11T03:15:00.000Z	anirudh0	iDN	this is unlikely to work..but try replaeing /dev/sdb1 by /dev/sdb in the cmd
2008-06-11T03:16:00.000Z	iDN	anirudh0	Already did. :) Worked like a charm.
2008-06-11T03:16:00.000Z	anirudh0	iDN	hmm..so a partiton is;nt needed to mount after all
2008-06-11T03:17:00.000Z	iDN	anirudh0	If I'd restart now, will the changes be saved for after the restart, and I'll be able to plug-and-play?
2008-06-11T03:17:00.000Z	anirudh0	iDN	edit the mountpoiint now..emptty it
2008-06-11T03:17:00.000Z	iDN	anirudh0	Where do I edit that?
2008-06-11T03:18:00.000Z	anirudh0	iDN	i think so
