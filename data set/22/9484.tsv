2006-06-25T09:57:00.000Z	Ng	kristian	what do you need to know for? X?
2006-06-25T09:58:00.000Z	Ng	kristian	generally you don't actually need to tell X which device to use, it can figure it out (and it prints a list when it starts, to /var/log/Xorg.0.log)
2006-06-25T10:18:00.000Z	Ng	kristian	small a
2006-06-25T10:19:00.000Z	Ng	kristian	I just told you how to fix yours :)
2006-06-25T10:22:00.000Z	Ng	kristian	then you need to enable universe
2006-06-25T10:23:00.000Z	Ng	kristian	did ubotu send you a URL? that page explains how
2006-06-25T10:24:00.000Z	Ng	kristian	can't find what? the package? have you updated your package listings since you enabled universe? (either Reload in synaptic or "sudo apt-get update" in a terminal)
2006-06-26T15:50:00.000Z	Ng	kristian	what kind of graphics card do you have?
2006-06-26T15:50:00.000Z	Ng	kristian	have you done the ati driver install?
2006-06-26T15:52:00.000Z	Ng	kristian	hmm, well I'm afraid I'm not the greatest ati expert ever, but I'd suggest having a look through the ati instructions on the wiki again and checking you did everything
2006-06-26T15:53:00.000Z	Ng	kristian	then I would suggest you take a look at the ati instruction in the wiki for the first time :)
2006-06-26T15:54:00.000Z	Ng	kristian	because evidently "easy"ubuntu got something wrong, which is to be expected from such things, unfortunately
2006-06-26T15:55:00.000Z	Ng	kristian	this is why we generally don't recommend people use such things, because they are never as good as reading the instructions yourself :)
2006-06-26T15:57:00.000Z	Ng	kristian	I would expect so, but I'm not 100% sure, I haven't really used the ati drivers
