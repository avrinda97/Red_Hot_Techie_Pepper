2010-09-20T19:10:00.000Z	c3l	AbhiJit	nono, lets say I want to swap some keys with each other in an existing layout
2010-09-20T19:10:00.000Z	AbhiJit	c3l	logically or actualy replacing the key on keyboard?
2010-09-20T19:12:00.000Z	c3l	AbhiJit	Im assuming this is a software support channel ;) so yeah, logically. when I press key x, letter y is sent to the computer
2010-09-20T19:12:00.000Z	AbhiJit	c3l	write your own driver!!!! :P
2010-09-20T19:13:00.000Z	c3l	AbhiJit	how? :O could I just copy the layout I want to modify, and make the changes and install it as a new layout?
2010-09-20T19:13:00.000Z	AbhiJit	c3l	you need to have driver programming knowledge for that!
2010-09-20T19:14:00.000Z	AbhiJit	c3l	tell me why you want to do it?
2010-09-20T19:16:00.000Z	c3l	AbhiJit	theres no other way? im using the colemak layout, love it. but I also have to type in swedish quite alot sometimes, åäö is on alt gr + q, w and ;. so I want to remap the local characters a bit (putting them on ";", "[" and "'". and letting those punctuation characters be on alt gr + their original button)
2010-09-20T19:16:00.000Z	AbhiJit	c3l	dunno ##hardware people might help
2010-09-20T19:17:00.000Z	c3l	AbhiJit	I know colemak isnt made for swedish, but it works great, and I write a lot in english too so its a great layout for both languagus, besides the local charactesr. But this is a software question! :)
2010-09-20T19:18:00.000Z	AbhiJit	c3l	yah you need to edit the source code of the layout. i dunno any other way i am a not expert!
2010-09-20T19:18:00.000Z	c3l	AbhiJit	its gpl :)
2010-09-20T19:18:00.000Z	AbhiJit	c3l	hmm
2010-09-20T19:20:00.000Z	c3l	AbhiJit	actually, its even in the puplic domain I see now
2010-09-20T19:20:00.000Z	AbhiJit	c3l	ok
2010-09-20T19:27:00.000Z	c3l	AbhiJit	actually, it turns out all I need to do is edit the plaintextfile that is the layout. thats it ;)
2010-09-20T19:27:00.000Z	AbhiJit	c3l	can you please document your this experience in ubuntu forum? so that other like you will get directions in future?
2010-09-20T19:28:00.000Z	c3l	AbhiJit	sounds like a good idea
2010-09-20T19:28:00.000Z	AbhiJit	c3l	yah and dnot forget to give me the link i wll download it. be exact and detailed
2010-09-20T21:05:00.000Z	AbhiJit	c3l	you there?
