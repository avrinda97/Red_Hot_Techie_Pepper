2010-06-04T06:19:00.000Z	militant		guys i feel a bit silly but i can't locate the flash plugin file itself, on 10.04 with the adobe ppa.
2010-06-04T06:19:00.000Z	royceremer	militant	npviewer
2010-06-04T06:20:00.000Z	militant	royceremer	doesn't exist on system or in repos?
2010-06-04T06:21:00.000Z	royceremer	militant	coorect, it's not open source - it's a proprietary driver/download
2010-06-04T06:21:00.000Z	royceremer	militant	and the service is called "npviewer"
2010-06-04T06:21:00.000Z	royceremer	militant	$ pgrep npviewer
2010-06-04T06:22:00.000Z	militant	royceremer	doesn't show anything.  and does this mean there's no .so or anything to point hulu desktop to?
2010-06-04T06:23:00.000Z	royceremer	militant	just means there's no flash running, that process only runs when there's flash video running
2010-06-04T06:24:00.000Z	militant	royceremer	i see.  could i perhaps install the old flash plugins, have hulu desktop use those, but specify the newer stuff for my browsers etc
2010-06-04T06:24:00.000Z	royceremer	militant	not sure what you need an old flash plugin for?
2010-06-04T06:25:00.000Z	militant	royceremer	kuz when i try to run hulu's desktop app it complains no flash plugin found and i don't know where to point .huluwhatever at with the flash setup you're describing
2010-06-04T06:26:00.000Z	royceremer	militant	hmm, didn't know hulu desktop existed... let me check
2010-06-04T06:28:00.000Z	militant	royceremer	fantastic.  yeah it's beta but my roomie dies when it doesn't work and i'm trying to get her to stick with linux
2010-06-04T06:29:00.000Z	royceremer	militant	ah, a prostelatizer... what's the advantage of the desktop app as opposed to the website? Is it faster?
2010-06-04T06:29:00.000Z	militant	royceremer	yes it does stream faster/lighter, allows you to customize your video settings a little easier, lighter on cpu also, plus queues the whole show instead of just 5 minutes or so, when you pause it
2010-06-04T06:32:00.000Z	royceremer	militant	nice, dling now to see if I can recreate the issue (I'm on lucid)
2010-06-04T06:33:00.000Z	militant	royceremer	excellent.
2010-06-04T06:38:00.000Z	militant	royceremer	i found a thread somewhere about someone using 32bit flash for hulu desktop and 64bit for everything else
2010-06-04T06:39:00.000Z	royceremer	militant	hmm, worked out of the box for me :s
2010-06-04T06:39:00.000Z	royceremer	militant	gl!
2010-06-04T06:40:00.000Z	militant	royceremer	appreciate the help.  i'll install it fresh since flash is working now and see what happens
2010-06-04T06:48:00.000Z	militant	royceremer	how can i get my hands on the old .so 32bit plugin itself?  i'm trawling the repos and the installers don't have the file itself at hand
