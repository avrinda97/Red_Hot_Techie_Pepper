2009-08-19T18:03:00.000Z	trothigar	aaron424	then try running compiz-manager again
2009-08-19T18:06:00.000Z	aaron424	trothigar	it works, but will it work every time I  boot up, or will have to run the commands again?

2009-08-19T18:08:00.000Z	trothigar	aaron424	it will work, but it might be best to reboot now, because if you close the terminal window bad things may happen. It probably won't work next boot, but then you just need to enable desktop effects under system->preferences-> appearance
2009-08-19T18:11:00.000Z	trothigar	aaron424	you sorted then?
2009-08-19T18:16:00.000Z	aaron424	trothigar	thanks so much
