2010-05-16T05:11:00.000Z	Daekdroom	sebsebseb	Wasn't ntfs-3g unable to repair NTFS partitions?
2010-05-17T02:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Daekdroom	Or find a ppa for later kernel, or install them selves, yeah.
2010-05-18T05:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Daekdroom	uh you mean if Krow had Windows installed first
2010-05-18T05:15:00.000Z	Daekdroom	sebsebseb	No, I mean ubuntu.
2010-05-18T05:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Daekdroom	it's easier if Windows is  installed first, since it does not like other operating systems
2010-05-18T05:16:00.000Z	Daekdroom	sebsebseb	yeah. That's why I asked if ubuntu was installed first.
2010-05-18T05:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Daekdroom	as a result if you put Windows on after Ubuntu, it will remove some of Grub, and only Windows will be able to boot
2010-05-18T05:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Daekdroom	uh yeah and then I thought I was talking to the person heh
2010-05-18T05:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Daekdroom	well not really heh, but anyway
2010-06-19T22:02:00.000Z	Daekdroom	sebsebseb	what would you expect? It is the default option
2010-06-19T22:02:00.000Z	Daekdroom	sebsebseb	if it was still ESD, pulseaudio wouldn't be the cause for most sound issues..
2010-06-19T22:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Daekdroom	alsa and such is better for most users
2010-06-19T22:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Daekdroom	as far as I know
2010-06-19T22:06:00.000Z	Daekdroom	sebsebseb	ontopic ?
2010-06-19T23:05:00.000Z	Daekdroom	sebsebseb	!repeat, perhaps
2010-06-19T23:07:00.000Z	Daekdroom	sebsebseb	is removing splash from /etc/default/grub enough/
2010-06-19T23:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Daekdroom	remove plymouth-label, plymouth-theme-ubuntu-{logo,text}, and plymouth-x11; then remove "splash" from /etc/default/grub and do sudo update-grub
2010-06-19T23:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Daekdroom	and you get a text boot instead
2011-04-30T05:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Daekdroom	yes
2011-04-30T05:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Daekdroom	ISO should  have the same code, as the mirror/webpage
2011-04-30T05:15:00.000Z	Daekdroom	sebsebseb	yeah, but I'm wondering wether the CD is damaged.
