2011-04-06T09:02:00.000Z	oscargotCLI		Hello, can anyone help me recover my GUi on ubuntu?
2011-04-06T09:02:00.000Z	mickster04	oscargotCLI	details please
2011-04-06T09:03:00.000Z	oscargotCLI	mickster04	I just installed the Ubuntu netbook remix edition on my netbook and there was no GUI or Wireless, ive recoveredt he Wireless now I believe but there is still no gui
2011-04-06T09:04:00.000Z	mickster04	oscargotCLI	how did you install it, sounds like the cd image was not complete
2011-04-06T09:05:00.000Z	oscargotCLI	mickster04	I had to use the live USB, then installed it regularly like  that
2011-04-06T09:05:00.000Z	mickster04	oscargotCLI	did you md5 the image first?
2011-04-06T09:06:00.000Z	oscargotCLI	mickster04	no I did not :(
2011-04-06T09:06:00.000Z	mickster04	oscargotCLI	try that, you may find it was not complete
2011-04-06T09:06:00.000Z	mickster04	oscargotCLI	did you do the "try it without making changes" option?
2011-04-06T09:07:00.000Z	oscargotCLI	mickster04	doesn't that option just run it off the Live CD? The Gui worked fine in the Live CD
2011-04-06T09:07:00.000Z	oscargotCLI	mickster04	err liveUSB*
2011-04-06T09:08:00.000Z	mickster04	oscargotCLI	yeah, if you tried that then i am unsure as to why it wouldn't install properly
2011-04-06T09:08:00.000Z	oscargotCLI	mickster04	Is there a command where I can update or active the video drivers? I am using intel integrated graphics
2011-04-06T09:09:00.000Z	mickster04	oscargotCLI	uhm not that i know of
2011-04-06T09:09:00.000Z	mickster04	oscargotCLI	try runnig" sudo service gdm restart"
2011-04-06T09:10:00.000Z	oscargotCLI	mickster04	it says unknown instance, if I try to use startx it will start the GUI and then will give me a blank screen for a bit
2011-04-06T09:11:00.000Z	oscargotCLI	mickster04	I'd have to REISUB out of it, and also, sometimes I end up with a GUI panel actually, but that just tells me that im in Low graphics mode, and it won't let me reconfigure or anything
2011-04-06T09:20:00.000Z	oscargotCLI	mickster04	Is there a way to check the error logs when I try to start up the gui?
2011-04-06T09:20:00.000Z	mickster04	oscargotCLI	not sure...i can't remember where they are, /var/logs?
2011-04-06T09:25:00.000Z	oscargotCLI	mickster04	I found something, it says something about not being able to find a kernel modesetting driver,  and the fatal error is "no screens found", would you happen to know anything about this? I can try putting this on the forum if it is too much a hassle for you to help T_T
2011-04-06T09:26:00.000Z	mickster04	oscargotCLI	i dunno about that.
2011-04-06T09:26:00.000Z	oscargotCLI	mickster04	That's okay, thank you so much for your help anyway :D
