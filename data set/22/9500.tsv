2006-09-10T11:58:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	so what was your problem?
2006-09-10T11:59:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	are you using GRUB console mode?
2006-09-10T12:00:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	ah then it is menu mode.
2006-09-10T12:01:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	GRUB is actually a shell, and what you see as the 5 options are the names of 5 scripts. But you can either edit the scripts or run any command directly to boot any kernel.
2006-09-10T12:01:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	have you got GRUB running now or are you dual bootin?
2006-09-10T12:03:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	ok. Not very encouraging :-(. There are two ways to boot again.
2006-09-10T12:04:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	one is to reinstall GRUB or LILO. There is a page on the Ubuntu wiki on how to do this by using the install CD as a rescue disk.
2006-09-10T12:04:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	another is to edit the GRUB scripts or enter console mode and find a kernel you can boot.
2006-09-10T12:05:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	the second way is quicker, but you need to understand how GRUB works.
2006-09-10T12:05:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	just to be sure: you cannot be in GRUB and online on IRC at the same time?
2006-09-10T12:06:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	ahhhh thats excellent!
2006-09-10T12:07:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	how can you edit '/boot/grub/menu.lst' without being able to boot into the system?
2006-09-10T12:08:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	so what is the problem? If you can boot into the system, what problem are you having?
2006-09-10T12:08:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	ahhhh so you can boot, but just not the kernel you made?
2006-09-10T12:08:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	uhmmmm could have said it a bit beforehand :-).
2006-09-10T12:09:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	well, all you really have to do is to copy the kernel to '/boot/', install the modules, and then add a new section to '/boot/grub/menu.lst'. There are tutorials/HOWTOs on doing this. What is the problem in doing it?
2006-09-10T12:11:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	well, the kernel would be 'arch/i386/boot/bzImage' wherever you put the sources.
2006-09-10T12:13:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	typically you would do like: 'cp -p arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-mine', and similarly 'cp -p System.map /boot/System.map-mine'. And then create a new entry in the GRUB config.
2006-09-10T12:13:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	it gets a bit more complicated if your newly build kernel needs an 'initrd' image, because then you need to build it.
2006-09-10T12:14:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	you could spare yourself some complications if you built the kernel with 'kpackage', which builds an installable '.deb' for you.
2006-09-10T12:17:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	'patch OPTIONS < ....'
2006-09-10T12:18:00.000Z	Blissex	jaysef	BTW it is very unlikely that you need to build your own kernel. It is not an easy thing to do well.
