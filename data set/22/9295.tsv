2010-08-25T01:03:00.000Z	Gnurdux		hey, serious problem
2010-08-25T01:03:00.000Z	Gnurdux		http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=991144 this bug, from over a year ago, is still there
2010-08-25T01:04:00.000Z	Gnurdux		and the fix doesnt work anymore afaik because it doesnt prompt about accessing the keyword
2010-08-25T01:04:00.000Z	Gnurdux		*keyring
2010-08-25T01:05:00.000Z	Gnurdux		I'm not sure if this is the right place to talk about such things, astoriakidd
2010-08-25T01:06:00.000Z	Gnurdux		those aren't really ubuntu questions
2010-08-25T01:07:00.000Z	Gnurdux		or because it's better for what they do
2010-08-25T01:07:00.000Z	Gnurdux		or because it's free
2010-08-25T01:07:00.000Z	Gnurdux		anyway: how do you manually enter something into the keyring?
2010-08-25T01:08:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnurdux	with seahorse
2010-08-25T01:10:00.000Z	Gnurdux	Seveas	in particular, do you know what format a VPN secret should take?
2010-08-25T01:11:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnurdux	ah, those can't be set manuallyt
2010-08-25T01:11:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnurdux	seahorse doesn't have an interface for adding random properties to secret and network-manager needs that
2010-08-25T01:12:00.000Z	Gnurdux	Seveas	and network-manager can't actually make these secrets because it forgets to prompt you
2010-08-25T01:12:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnurdux	it will not prompt because you need to configure them beforehand
2010-08-25T01:13:00.000Z	Gnurdux	Seveas	how?
2010-08-25T01:14:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnurdux	which vpn type?
2010-08-25T01:16:00.000Z	Gnurdux	Seveas	it has no password entry field, and when i try to connect it says it can't find valid vpn secrets
2010-08-25T01:17:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnurdux	time to file a bug then.
2010-08-25T01:31:00.000Z	Gnurdux	Seveas	got it using the suggested hack
2010-08-25T01:32:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnurdux	that's pretty awful
2010-08-25T01:32:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnurdux	please do file a bug though
