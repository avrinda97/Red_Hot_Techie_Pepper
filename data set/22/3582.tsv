2008-07-29T05:37:00.000Z	synapse4956		Why might a command I place in a startup script not run on startup, but it does when i run it from a terminal?
2008-07-29T05:38:00.000Z	unop	synapse4956	what does the command do?  or better, what is the command?
2008-07-29T05:39:00.000Z	synapse4956	unop	it is the deluged daemon. I run it after I run "deluge --ui web -l /var/www/deluge.log"
2008-07-29T05:41:00.000Z	unop	synapse4956	so what was the exact command you placed in the startup file? i'm assuming this is the gnome startup file? i wonder why you aren't using the session properties dialog to place this command in?
2008-07-29T05:45:00.000Z	synapse4956	unop	the exact line is "deluged", deluged is just the daemon for the deluge bittorrent client. It is placed in a file called /etc/init.d/startup that also contains some other commands that fix my wireless card, etc. on startup. After startup, ps aux | grep deluge does not show that the daemon is running. If I run sudo /etc/init.d/startup from a terminal and then list services, it shows that deluged is running fine and e
2008-07-29T05:47:00.000Z	unop	synapse4956	making a startup script and placing it in /etc/init.d does not automatically make it run when you enter a runlevel .. you need to enable that script for the runlevel you usually work in (by default is it 2) .. have you enabled the script in runlevel 2?
2008-07-29T05:48:00.000Z	synapse4956	unop	yep, ive done that. it runs on startup, every other line executes, jsut not this one
2008-07-29T05:49:00.000Z	unop	synapse4956	can i have a look at that script on a pastebin?
2008-07-29T05:50:00.000Z	synapse4956	unop	http://pastebin.com/m24eaa96e
2008-07-29T05:52:00.000Z	synapse4956	unop	I will admit it's kind of rigged up, but the networking stuff works :-D
2008-07-29T05:53:00.000Z	unop	synapse4956	i don't use deluge - but do you know if it is safe to run deluge as root like you are trying to do?  some apps will simply not run as root?
2008-07-29T05:54:00.000Z	unop	synapse4956	also, there might be a switch to deluge to have it run in the background.  deluge -d perhaps?
2008-07-29T05:55:00.000Z	synapse4956	unop	I have started it with sudo at it will run.
2008-07-29T05:57:00.000Z	synapse4956	unop	deluge doesnt list such an option
2008-07-29T05:59:00.000Z	unop	synapse4956	what you could do is log commands - like this. http://pastebin.com/d288b8e86
2008-07-29T06:00:00.000Z	synapse4956	unop	alright, i'll test it out
2008-07-29T06:09:00.000Z	synapse4956	unop	The log only contains what was echoed out by the startup script, no errors.
2008-07-29T06:10:00.000Z	unop	synapse4956	hmm, maybe have a look through /var/log/{messages,dmesg}  to see if deluge exited abnormally.
2008-07-29T06:15:00.000Z	synapse4956	unop	nothing there abnormal
2008-07-29T06:25:00.000Z	synapse4956	unop	Some of the documentation recommends starting the daemon with inittab: http://forum.deluge-torrent.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=3185
2008-07-29T06:28:00.000Z	unop	synapse4956	heh.  /usr/bin/deluged -d -p 58846 &> /var/log/deluged.log # sounds to me like this starts the daemon
2008-07-29T06:28:00.000Z	unop	synapse4956	that was from the same page you are looking at there
