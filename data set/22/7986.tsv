2006-01-08T13:27:00.000Z	Jonc101		Does anyone know if there's a free app similar to vmware for linux?
2006-01-08T13:27:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	vmware qemu
2006-01-08T13:28:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	use vmware player to play, qemu to build...
2006-01-08T13:36:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	how many clients?
2006-01-08T13:37:00.000Z	Jonc101	blue-frog	about 5 users in this scenario.  schoota, ya very messy lol but if it works :D.
2006-01-08T13:38:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	have a look at freenx
2006-01-08T13:38:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	that means windows with the freenx server will be used by the 5 clients
2006-01-08T13:39:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	but am not sure where your problem lies anyway, your windows clients don't get a dhcp address, is that the problem?
2006-01-08T13:41:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	ok then ubuntu clients with freenx clients and windows with freenx server, your ubuntu clients will log with freenx on windows (freenx = faster than vnc)
2006-01-08T13:42:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	or freenx clients on windows clients..
2006-01-08T13:42:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	so that they will wrok on the windows freenx server
2006-01-08T13:44:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	with freenx... log on to windows, start freenx clients, at that stage they work on the windows machine which holds the freenx server..
2006-01-08T13:45:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	so no roaming profile needed, the profiles are kept on the machine with freenx server
2006-01-08T13:47:00.000Z	Jonc101	blue-frog	how does this nx server work?
2006-01-08T13:48:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	what happens if they log in and log out, is the wifi connection still working?
2006-01-08T13:48:00.000Z	Jonc101	blue-frog	yes that will work but if we reboot then we have the same problem
2006-01-08T13:49:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	if it works you should teach them to do it, will the better stuff to do (except if microsoft finds out a solution)
2006-01-08T13:50:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	freenx is vnc like program except it is faster and secured by default
2006-01-08T13:51:00.000Z	Jonc101	blue-frog	i dont think its applicable in this situation because the apps are windows based and are on pc's not dumb terminals :(
2006-01-08T13:51:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	then teach them to log oout log in..
2006-01-08T13:53:00.000Z	Jonc101	blue-frog	they already log in and out.
2006-01-08T13:53:00.000Z	blue-frog	Jonc101	then it's the best so.lution they have..
