2006-12-27T10:52:00.000Z	Z_Morek		anyone know why ubuntu gdm login screen plays sounds but lspci isn't showing my sound card and mplayer/mythfrontend won't play audio
2006-12-27T10:53:00.000Z	arrenlex	Z_Morek	run mplayer from the command line on a music file and pastebin everything it says, please.
2006-12-27T10:54:00.000Z	arrenlex	Z_Morek	So all other audio is played fine?
2006-12-27T10:54:00.000Z	Z_Morek	arrenlex	the only other audio I've heard is the sounds that play at the gdm login screen
2006-12-27T10:54:00.000Z	Z_Morek	arrenlex	i tried to cat random to dsp and nothing happened
2006-12-27T10:55:00.000Z	arrenlex	Z_Morek	Run "mplayer" on some sound file and pastebin the output please.

2006-12-27T10:59:00.000Z	Z_Morek	arrenlex	it plays as root
2006-12-27T11:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	Z_Morek	download and run this as root: http://arrenlex.diff.be/alsaconf
2006-12-27T11:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	Z_Morek	Then try it.
2006-12-27T11:00:00.000Z	Z_Morek	arrenlex	I played it when I ran it "sudo mplayer ..."
2006-12-27T11:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	Z_Morek	(this is the alsa configurator script from the debian version of the alsa-utils package that I keep around for when things break :))
2006-12-27T11:00:00.000Z	Z_Morek	arrenlex	should I just change some permissions or groups or something?
2006-12-27T11:01:00.000Z	arrenlex	Z_Morek	All that says to me is that it's a configuration program, not a hardware program. That script will redetect your soundcard and reload your modules. Try it first.
2006-12-27T11:03:00.000Z	Z_Morek	arrenlex	it gives me a syntax error...
2006-12-27T11:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	Z_Morek	Try "bash alsaconf".
2006-12-27T11:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	Z_Morek	sudo bash alsaconf, I guess.
2006-12-27T11:04:00.000Z	arrenlex	Z_Morek	Still no luck?
2006-12-27T11:04:00.000Z	Z_Morek	arrenlex	I'm navigating it...
2006-12-27T11:06:00.000Z	Z_Morek	arrenlex	it's a permissions issue...
2006-12-27T11:06:00.000Z	Z_Morek	arrenlex	I ran it configured it etc... and it still won't run as user
2006-12-27T11:07:00.000Z	Z_Morek	arrenlex	but it runs as root
