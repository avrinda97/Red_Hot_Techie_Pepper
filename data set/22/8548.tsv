2005-07-13T13:46:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN		blegh.... that's going to make things SOOO complicated...
2005-07-13T13:47:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN		yea... but it feels... soo... disrespectful...

2005-07-13T13:48:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN		can you game that much on linux?
2005-07-13T13:48:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN		didn't think you could...
2005-07-13T13:49:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN		yea... so I figure that I'll just keep XP for gaming and Linux for ALL else
2005-07-13T13:49:00.000Z	othernoob	MidNightRaVeN	don't you think you'll get annoyed ..i mean..rebooting all the time...
2005-07-13T13:53:00.000Z	othernoob	MidNightRaVeN	you could give wine and cedega a try.. or if you must, vmware with xp.
2005-07-13T13:55:00.000Z	othernoob	MidNightRaVeN	yea i understand that. but everyone i know, who's a gamer and dualbooted, stayed in XP for casual stuff after playing a game..
2005-07-13T15:26:00.000Z	othernoob	MidNightRaVeN	cedega used to be called winex
2005-07-13T15:27:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	othernoob	i haven't been around long enough to hear of either...
2005-07-13T15:34:00.000Z	othernoob	MidNightRaVeN	and what is the problem?
2005-07-13T15:37:00.000Z	othernoob	MidNightRaVeN	do you use kde or gnome?

2005-07-14T11:28:00.000Z	othernoob	MidNightRaVeN	 congrats
2005-07-14T11:32:00.000Z	othernoob	MidNightRaVeN	that depends on your cpu
2005-07-14T11:33:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	othernoob	i have 64 but was thinking of just using x86 for ease of use
2005-07-16T15:27:00.000Z	othernoob	MidNightRaVeN	why would Azureus not run on 64bit?
