2007-04-10T16:56:00.000Z	fevel		can someone please help? I used alien to convert vmwareworkstation into deb and installed it. bBut when I run /usr/bin/vmware-config.pl it returns an error message in the end
2007-04-10T16:56:00.000Z	bruenig	fevel	aliening vmware is probably not a good idea
2007-04-10T16:56:00.000Z	bruenig	fevel	aliening small things here and there, probably harmless, but vmware is definitely not something you want to do that on
2007-04-10T05:06:00.000Z	bruenig	fevel	you have to tell us what the error is, and use pastebin please
2007-04-10T05:07:00.000Z	bruenig	fevel	sounds like it is saying that the package's control file has two entries for original maintainer
2007-04-10T05:07:00.000Z	fevel	bruenig	My noobness makes me have no idea what that means
2007-04-10T05:08:00.000Z	bruenig	fevel	it is an error I have never seen and I can't begin to think of how to fix it, I mean maybe some dpkg -r --force-all package kind of thing might do it, very funny error
2007-04-10T05:08:00.000Z	fevel	bruenig	if it helps: it started after I installed vmware with an aliened .deb package
2007-04-10T05:08:00.000Z	bruenig	fevel	yeah bad idea
2007-04-10T05:09:00.000Z	bruenig	fevel	try removing that package
2007-04-10T05:09:00.000Z	fevel	bruenig	I cant...it just tells me to apt-get -f install
2007-04-10T05:09:00.000Z	fevel	bruenig	lol
2007-04-10T05:09:00.000Z	bruenig	fevel	it must tell you more than that
2007-04-10T05:10:00.000Z	fevel	bruenig	since i installed it with dpkg -i i did a dpkg -r vmwareworkstation
2007-04-10T05:11:00.000Z	fevel	bruenig	and it just tells me that duplicate maintainer thing
2007-04-10T05:11:00.000Z	bruenig	fevel	try sudo dpkg -r --force-all vmwareworkstation
2007-07-16T09:11:00.000Z	bruenig	fevel	it is likely that ubuntu has an old version of azureus
2007-07-16T09:11:00.000Z	bruenig	fevel	ubuntu is not too big on latest applications
2007-07-16T09:11:00.000Z	fevel	bruenig	why is that??
2007-07-16T09:11:00.000Z	bruenig	fevel	just aren't
2007-10-16T14:48:00.000Z	bruenig	fevel	no he wasn't, he though he had found something that I hadn't seen and tried to act like he had achieved something but failed to realize that < 48 kb file recovery is what he found which is nearly useless
2007-10-16T14:48:00.000Z	fevel	bruenig	yeah I just saw it...but its ok. make peace =)
