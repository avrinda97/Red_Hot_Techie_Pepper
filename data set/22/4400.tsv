2011-07-15T21:49:00.000Z	StevenR		hi. When I resume from hibernate sometimes, the display is corrupt in places (title bars, panel, dialogs). Is there I way I can fix this, some config session? It didn't happen under Lucid, it's something that's only happened since the upgrade to natty.
2011-07-15T21:49:00.000Z	StevenR		s/session/setting/
2011-07-15T21:49:00.000Z	StevenR		I can reboot to "fix" it, but that's not really a fix.
2011-07-15T21:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StevenR	did you upgrade from Lucid to Maverick first?
2011-07-15T21:50:00.000Z	StevenR	ActionParsnip	yes
2011-07-15T21:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StevenR	good. Just clearing that up :)
2011-07-15T21:51:00.000Z	StevenR	ActionParsnip	lucid -> fully updated lucid -> maverick -> reboot -> natty -> reboot -> fully updated natty -> rebooted since that
2011-07-15T21:54:00.000Z	StevenR	ActionParsnip	I'd like to disable compiz if possible, or whatever's doing the desktop effects stuff (running classic)
2011-08-08T00:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StevenR	when you last unplugged the device, what steps did you take?
2011-08-08T00:10:00.000Z	StevenR	ActionParsnip	none... but there aren't any I can take....
2011-08-08T00:10:00.000Z	StevenR	ActionParsnip	they're DVB usb sticks and keyboard/mouse
2011-08-08T00:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StevenR	have you ever removed it from a system before?
2011-08-08T00:11:00.000Z	StevenR	ActionParsnip	yes
2011-08-08T00:12:00.000Z	StevenR	ActionParsnip	what do you mean by "it" ? (there's 4 usb devices)
2011-08-08T00:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StevenR	ok and did you use the safetly remove option in the OS?
2011-08-08T00:13:00.000Z	StevenR	ActionParsnip	where is this "safely remove option" ?
2011-08-08T00:13:00.000Z	StevenR	ActionParsnip	these are not storage devices
2011-08-08T00:15:00.000Z	StevenR	ActionParsnip	it's two tv tuners ("DVB usb sticks"), a keyboard and a mouse
2011-08-08T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StevenR	has it been in a windows system?
2011-08-08T00:41:00.000Z	StevenR	ActionParsnip	mythtv was holding onto one of the DVB devices and locking the usb subsystem
2011-08-08T00:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StevenR	nice find :)
2011-08-08T00:43:00.000Z	StevenR	ActionParsnip	which means if I want to remove them or they break again, I'll need to stop mythtv first (which is a little rubbish, but it appears to be due to a bug in the kernel)
