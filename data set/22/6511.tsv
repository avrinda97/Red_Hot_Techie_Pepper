2008-02-24T10:25:00.000Z	storm-zen	nickrud	Heard the part about not having any gnome incons or menus and installing x-windows by hand, did you? ;)
2008-02-24T10:26:00.000Z	nickrud	storm-zen	by installing X by hand, what exactly do you mean? I assumed you used the ubuntu packages
2008-02-24T10:26:00.000Z	storm-zen	nickrud	I found something called "ubuntu--desktop" ( I think ) in synaptic ( I think was what I used. )
2008-02-24T10:27:00.000Z	nickrud	storm-zen	ok, good. That's more than X, and that's the exactly right way to install the desktop. So, what do you mean, no gnome icons?
2008-02-24T10:27:00.000Z	storm-zen	nickrud	I have a camera and a speaker on a little bitty panel... and that's it.
2008-02-24T10:29:00.000Z	nickrud	storm-zen	synaptic is itself, there's no other version.
2008-02-24T10:30:00.000Z	storm-zen	nickrud	Ok.  I used some tui to install X-WIndows.  Guess I don't know what it was, then.
2008-02-24T10:30:00.000Z	nickrud	storm-zen	apt-get ?
2008-02-24T10:30:00.000Z	storm-zen	nickrud	No... it had an interface.. menus...
2008-02-24T10:31:00.000Z	storm-zen	nickrud	That command to reset the panels worked like a charm.  THanks.
2008-02-25T01:14:00.000Z	nickrud	storm-zen	the package name is xine-ui
2008-02-25T01:41:00.000Z	nickrud	storm-zen	wow, that is a *huge* root , does that include home?
2008-02-25T01:42:00.000Z	storm-zen	nickrud	Nope.  But I don't want to have any issues with compiling, applicaitons, etc.
2008-02-25T01:42:00.000Z	nickrud	storm-zen	heh. I do all that in home, but then this is a single user machine
2008-02-25T01:43:00.000Z	storm-zen	nickrud	So is mine.  It's possible I went a little overboard...
2008-02-25T01:43:00.000Z	nickrud	storm-zen	nah, if you have a huge drive, it doesn't matter
2008-02-25T07:58:00.000Z	nickrud	storm-zen	 use gksu
2008-02-25T08:00:00.000Z	nickrud	storm-zen	that is working because you used sudo in the last 15 minutes
2008-02-25T08:00:00.000Z	storm-zen	nickrud	haha.. oh.
2008-02-26T08:04:00.000Z	nickrud	storm-zen	I can relate. I think I installed debian in my first month, and .... looked at that $. Installed redhat, did a few lfs builds, then came back :)
2008-02-26T08:04:00.000Z	storm-zen	nickrud	Hehe... My experience was a little more devastating.  Stayed with core until 3 days ago, and still didn't want to go to Ubuntu because I knew they were related. :P
