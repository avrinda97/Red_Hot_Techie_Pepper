2005-02-25T09:36:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		sigh, I'm still dealing with this GNOME consistant hdd writing problem... anyone wanna lend me a hand?
2005-02-25T09:38:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		It seems that every 3 or 4 seconds, (like clockwork) about 25k or so is writen to my drive... but only when I'm logged into Gnome.
2005-02-25T09:40:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		I've found others with the same problem... http://www.fedoraforum.org/forum/showthread.php?t=24472
2005-02-25T09:40:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	CubicllyCentric	maybe its FAM?
2005-02-25T09:41:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		what does fam do?
2005-02-25T09:41:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	CubicllyCentric	"file alteration monitor", part of GNOME
2005-02-25T09:42:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		and what will happen if i kill it's process?
2005-02-25T09:43:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	CubicllyCentric	other programs will become unaware of other program's file changes.
2005-02-25T09:44:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric	MobyTurbo	and fam could be writing to the disk? I don't think I'd want to lose that feature...
2005-02-25T09:44:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	CubicllyCentric	I vaguely recall that as being the explaination.
2005-02-25T09:46:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		I've read about this problem around the net, but it does not seem to be widespread. I've only seen it on my home computer (the one I'm on now)...
2005-02-25T09:47:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric	MobyTurbo	nope.. killing famd did not stop it.
2005-02-25T09:48:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric	MobyTurbo	but thanks, that's the best help I've been able to find in the past two days. . .sigh.
2005-02-25T09:48:00.000Z	MobyTurbo		ok, good luck
2005-02-25T09:49:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		Well you are using ubuntu and gnome right?
2005-02-25T09:49:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	CubicllyCentric	yup
2005-02-25T09:49:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	CubicllyCentric	Ubuntu warty
2005-02-25T09:49:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		Is your disk activity light flashing slightly every few seconds on the dot?
2005-02-25T09:49:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	CubicllyCentric	yes
2005-02-25T09:50:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		(ubuntu, warty here too)
2005-02-25T09:50:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric	MobyTurbo	and this does not worry you?
2005-02-25T09:50:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	CubicllyCentric	I figure the computer knows what it's doing. ;-)
