2011-03-10T02:50:00.000Z	mickster04	jiltdil	and did you actually enter a command to run?

2011-03-10T02:51:00.000Z	mickster04	jiltdil	and what was this command of which you speak?
2011-03-10T02:51:00.000Z	jiltdil	mickster04	   thats      simply   a
2011-03-10T02:52:00.000Z	mickster04	jiltdil	.... there should be a text box you  enter this command intp
2011-03-10T02:53:00.000Z	jiltdil	mickster04	i write in custom command simply "a"
2011-03-10T02:53:00.000Z	jiltdil	mickster04	a without quotes
2011-03-10T02:56:00.000Z	jiltdil		mickster04:http://img806.imageshack.us/content_round.php?page=done&l=img806/4992/screenshot1fgy.png    see this i have had done that
2011-03-10T02:59:00.000Z	mickster04	jiltdil	and now you can't open terminal or what
2011-03-10T03:00:00.000Z	jiltdil	mickster04	i can't open my terminal
2011-03-10T03:00:00.000Z	mickster04	jiltdil	oh did you also notice that below that is "when this command is run do:" followed by 'close terminal'?
2011-03-10T03:01:00.000Z	mickster04	jiltdil	hum...not at all :( in which case you may need to work out where gnome terminal stores it's settings like that
2011-03-10T03:01:00.000Z	jiltdil	mickster04	so how to overcome this problem?
2011-03-10T03:02:00.000Z	mickster04	jiltdil	i don't know, find the gnome-terminal settings, manually edit them and remove that. it may be in gconf that you wanna start looking
