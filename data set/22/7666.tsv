2009-02-23T12:41:00.000Z	rdw200169	eepberries	you can use testdisk for that...
2009-02-23T12:41:00.000Z	eepberries	rdw200169	oh is that available on linux?
2009-02-23T12:41:00.000Z	rdw200169	eepberries	it'll seek out and find old partition tables
2009-02-23T12:41:00.000Z	rdw200169	eepberries	yup
2009-02-23T12:41:00.000Z	eepberries		oh okay
2009-02-23T12:41:00.000Z	eepberries		cool
2009-02-23T12:42:00.000Z	rdw200169	eepberries	you *are* talking about finding partitions that have been deleted, right?
2009-02-23T12:42:00.000Z	eepberries	rdw200169	not sure, it isn't my problem. i'm trying to help int256 figure out why some of his partitions are missing
2009-02-23T12:42:00.000Z	rdw200169	eepberries	not just hard to detect, like ext3 on windows
2009-02-23T12:42:00.000Z	eepberries		or if they're just gone
2009-02-23T12:43:00.000Z	rdw200169	eepberries	b/c parted will show everything, regardless of whether or not its mountable
2009-02-23T12:43:00.000Z	rdw200169	eepberries	same thing w/gparted, the gtk parted frontend
2009-02-23T12:43:00.000Z	eepberries	rdw200169	well he said gparted showed the hard drive as being unallocated
2009-02-23T12:44:00.000Z	eepberries	rdw200169	would that be scanning for partitions that could be lost?
2009-02-23T12:44:00.000Z	rdw200169	eepberries	no, go with testdisk.  it can also repair screwed up partition tables
2009-02-23T12:44:00.000Z	eepberries	rdw200169	alright well int256's using a program called gpart right now
2009-02-23T12:45:00.000Z	rdw200169	eepberries	int256 refer to the documentation here for help, this may do what you want: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk
2009-02-23T12:45:00.000Z	rdw200169	eepberries	yeah, but gparted said that it was 'unallocated' that's not very useful
2009-02-23T12:45:00.000Z	eepberries	rdw200169	yeah if gpart doesn't find it (i don't know anything about this program) i'll have int256 installtestdisk
2009-02-23T12:45:00.000Z	eepberries	rdw200169	gpart, not gparted
2009-02-23T12:45:00.000Z	eepberries		i think they're different
2009-02-23T12:46:00.000Z	rdw200169	eepberries	ah, testdisk and gpart do about the same thing... i prefer testdisk personally... (also int256 )
