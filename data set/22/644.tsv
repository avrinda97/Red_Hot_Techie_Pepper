2011-06-02T05:35:00.000Z	sabiancrash_cgx		no love in #grub
2011-06-02T05:36:00.000Z	sabiancrash_cgx		redoing this server is going to make me cry
2011-06-02T05:37:00.000Z	edbian	sabiancrash_cgx	Not that I can help but.  What is the issue?
2011-06-02T05:40:00.000Z	sabiancrash_cgx	edbian	I have a ubuntu 9.04 install on a virtualbox VM that hangs at the Grub loading, please wait screen
2011-06-02T05:40:00.000Z	edbian	sabiancrash_cgx	Have you tried re-installing grub to the MBR??
2011-06-02T05:41:00.000Z	sabiancrash_cgx	edbian	I have checked the partition priority, I have reinstalled grub, and have even tried upgrading to grub 2
2011-06-02T05:42:00.000Z	edbian	sabiancrash_cgx	Re-installed grub how?
2011-06-02T05:42:00.000Z	sabiancrash_cgx	edbian	when I attempt to upgrade to grub2 in a chroot from a livecd it hangs using 100% cpu on Generating core.img
2011-06-02T05:42:00.000Z	edbian	sabiancrash_cgx	I think the HDD is dying
2011-06-02T05:42:00.000Z	edbian	sabiancrash_cgx	That's my guess
2011-06-02T05:42:00.000Z	sabiancrash_cgx	edbian	its a vm
2011-06-02T05:42:00.000Z	edbian	sabiancrash_cgx	mmmmm
2011-06-02T05:43:00.000Z	edbian	sabiancrash_cgx	There could still be a hdd error.  At the end of the day the VM is on the hdd too
2011-06-02T05:44:00.000Z	edbian	sabiancrash_cgx	I don't know.  Strange error.  Sounds like hardware to me
2011-06-02T05:44:00.000Z	sabiancrash_cgx	edbian	I could move the vm to another machine and test
2011-06-02T05:45:00.000Z	edbian	sabiancrash_cgx	yep.  You really don't wanna re-install this server.  Do you have backups?
2011-06-02T05:46:00.000Z	edbian	sabiancrash_cgx	Sorry to hear that :(  Good luck!
2011-06-02T06:29:00.000Z	sabiancrash_cgx	edbian	rsync time to zfs pool and then resetup server :(
2011-06-02T06:29:00.000Z	edbian	sabiancrash_cgx	:/
2011-06-02T07:40:00.000Z	sabiancrash_cgx	edbian	is not longer here: well for posterity, tried that vdk on another host machine, grub still hangs on boot up
2011-06-07T00:47:00.000Z	sabiancrash_cgx	edbian	So in regards to my grub hanging, I ended up having to install to a new VM with a dedicated boot parition and then cp -a my non virtual dirs over in a liveCD.  Didn't go flawlessly as my networking and fstab was messed up but easier correcting those than reinstalling. Turns out the vdk was irrepairably corrupt.
2011-06-07T00:48:00.000Z	edbian	sabiancrash_cgx	Glad you fixed it!  thanks for telling me what happened :)
