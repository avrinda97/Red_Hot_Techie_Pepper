2006-09-11T07:12:00.000Z	voici		hi, i have got a problem with my ubuntu installation. i somehow changed something. the kernel isn't able to load modules anymore.
2006-09-11T07:12:00.000Z	voici		my /var/log/messages says directly after booting
2006-09-11T07:12:00.000Z	voici		Loaded 23037 symbols from /boot/System.map-2.6.15-26-386
2006-09-11T07:12:00.000Z	voici		Symbols match kernel version 2.6.15
2006-09-11T07:12:00.000Z	voici		No module symbols loaded - kernel modules not enabled
2006-09-11T07:13:00.000Z	voici		i think i did a ldconfig a while before thinbgs went bad. any way to fix it?
2006-09-11T07:13:00.000Z	sethk	voici	that message has nothing to do with ldconfig
2006-09-11T07:13:00.000Z	sethk	voici	that's kernel modules and symbols, a different thing altogether
2006-09-11T07:14:00.000Z	sethk	voici	my guess is that you somehow installed a new kernel but didn't install it's modules.
2006-09-11T07:15:00.000Z	sethk	voici	do lsmod.  does it list anything?
2006-09-11T07:15:00.000Z	sethk	voici	it says you have a module/kernel mismatch, and it won't install any drivers.
2006-09-11T07:15:00.000Z	sethk	voici	try reinstalling the kernel image you are running.
2006-09-11T07:16:00.000Z	sethk	voici	not reconfigure, reinstall
2006-09-11T07:18:00.000Z	voici	sethk	thanks. i don't have the cdrom deb in my /apt/sources.list anymore, can you give me a hint how to add it again?
2006-09-11T07:19:00.000Z	sethk	voici	sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-kernel...........
2006-09-11T07:19:00.000Z	sethk	voici	if it complains, tell us.
2006-09-11T07:22:00.000Z	voici	sethk	ok i reinstalled it. now just reboot?
2006-09-11T07:25:00.000Z	voici	sethk	cool it works again. thankyou very mouch. any idea what might have caused it? nothing to do with ldconfig you said....!?
2006-09-11T07:25:00.000Z	sethk	voici	right.  ldconfig is related to shared libraries, the .so files in /lib, /usr/lib, etc.
2006-09-11T07:25:00.000Z	sethk	voici	this problem is related to kernel symbols.  the modules (in /lib/modules) must be available for the running kernel.
2006-09-11T07:25:00.000Z	sethk	voici	I have no idea.
2006-09-11T07:25:00.000Z	sethk	voici	indeed, strange.
