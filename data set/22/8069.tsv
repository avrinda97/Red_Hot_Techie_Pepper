2005-11-03T16:07:00.000Z	vbgunz	bluefrog-10	I just upgraded the kernel from 386 to 686 and can no longer run vmware... chances are I'll need to reinstall?
2005-11-03T16:07:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	vbgunz	vmware yes
2005-11-03T16:07:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	vbgunz	takes 1 min to do it
2005-11-03T16:08:00.000Z	vbgunz	bluefrog-10	one question... was 686 compiled with gcc 3.4 or 4?
2005-11-03T16:08:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	vbgunz	but u will have to dl linux-header for ur ^*^
2005-11-03T16:08:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	vbgunz	no 4
2005-11-03T16:08:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	vbgunz	export CC=....
2005-11-03T16:08:00.000Z	vbgunz	bluefrog-10	yes, I remember that too... I'll wrote me a little walkthrough really quick... will have to modify it for kernel 686 then
2005-11-03T16:09:00.000Z	vbgunz	bluefrog-10	thanks bro, I know the export trick before installation ;)
2005-11-03T16:09:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	vbgunz	what vmware do u install?
2005-11-03T16:09:00.000Z	vbgunz	bluefrog-10	workstation 5
2005-11-03T16:10:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	vbgunz	not the latest rc1?
2005-11-03T16:10:00.000Z	vbgunz	bluefrog-10	No I got the beta form in email *but* didn't bother... is it good?
2005-11-03T16:10:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	vbgunz	yes but u might have pb to install it in ubu, stick with ur 5
2005-11-03T16:11:00.000Z	vbgunz	bluefrog-10	yup, workstation 5 works for me :)
2005-11-03T16:11:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	vbgunz	stick with it
2005-11-03T16:12:00.000Z	vbgunz	bluefrog-10	whats the major difference? In my email, they mentioned running ghost images and microsoft machines... is that it?
2005-11-03T16:12:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	vbgunz	basically yes maybe some more stuff.
2005-11-03T16:13:00.000Z	vbgunz	bluefrog-10	cool, I'll mess with the stable once out ;)
