2006-05-23T16:06:00.000Z	NoUse	megaman123	edit the entry in /etc/fstab, to the options section add uid=<youruser>,umask=0007
2006-05-23T16:08:00.000Z	megaman123	NoUse	do i have to restart after that ? (sorry new to linux - used to windows)
2006-05-23T16:09:00.000Z	NoUse	megaman123	umount and remount it
2006-05-23T16:09:00.000Z	megaman123	NoUse	how ? whats the command ? for mounting
2006-05-23T16:11:00.000Z	NoUse	megaman123	run 'mount' to see where they are mounted
2006-05-23T16:11:00.000Z	NoUse	megaman123	then 'sudo umount /mount/point' to umount from that location
2006-05-23T16:14:00.000Z	NoUse	megaman123	oh, so to remount just type 'sudo mount /dev/hdax'
2006-05-23T16:14:00.000Z	NoUse	megaman123	whatever the actual dev name is
2006-05-23T16:15:00.000Z	NoUse	megaman123	what are you trying to change now?
2006-05-23T16:16:00.000Z	NoUse	megaman123	you need to give the full path
2006-05-23T16:18:00.000Z	megaman123	NoUse	i have the drives mounted but how can access them from console?
2006-05-23T16:18:00.000Z	NoUse	megaman123	you have to use the full path: cd /media/hdb2
2006-05-23T16:18:00.000Z	megaman123	NoUse	yaaa :) thanks
2006-05-23T16:18:00.000Z	NoUse	megaman123	sure
2006-05-23T16:19:00.000Z	megaman123	NoUse	why dont i have write permission to them ??
2006-05-23T16:19:00.000Z	NoUse	megaman123	because Microsoft won't tell us how NTFS works
2006-05-23T16:20:00.000Z	megaman123	NoUse	really !!!! so u can not write on ntfs partitions ???
2006-05-23T16:20:00.000Z	NoUse	megaman123	no
2006-05-23T16:20:00.000Z	megaman123	NoUse	wow ...
2006-05-23T16:20:00.000Z	NoUse	megaman123	if you want to share date between windows and linux, you should create a fat32 parition, linux can write to that
2006-05-23T16:23:00.000Z	megaman123	NoUse	ok...np for now...and what if i want to connect to a shared dirve on my network..is there are a way to make this permenant when system boots?
