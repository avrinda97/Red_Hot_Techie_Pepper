2006-04-08T15:44:00.000Z	matthinckley		thats where flight 6 is
2006-04-08T15:44:00.000Z	matthinckley		http://www.ubuntu.com/testing
2006-04-08T15:45:00.000Z	matthinckley		I'm using Dapper Flight 6 right now and I love it compared to Breezy
2006-04-08T15:46:00.000Z	matthinckley		I just wouldn't recommend a dist-upgrade.. fresh install worked much better for me.. had lots of problems after dist-upgrade
2006-04-08T15:47:00.000Z	matthinckley		apt-get dist-upgrade borked my system
2006-04-08T15:48:00.000Z	matthinckley		I had firefox 1.5 installed on breezy and openoffice 2.0 installed.. when I apt-get dist-upgrade firefox was confused, since it upgraded the original to 1.5 but I still had the other 1.5 and it uninstalled openoffice alltogether
2006-04-08T15:48:00.000Z	matthinckley		also when I installed Xgl/compiz after a dist-upgrade, it wouldn't let me login
2006-04-08T15:48:00.000Z	matthinckley		just kicked me back to the login screen over and over again
2006-04-08T15:49:00.000Z	matthinckley		fresh install of Dapper Flight 6 plus Xgl/compiz working awesome!
2006-04-08T15:49:00.000Z	matthinckley		yes you can play wmv's in ubuntu
2006-04-08T15:49:00.000Z	CountZ	matthinckley	what display adapter?
2006-04-08T15:50:00.000Z	matthinckley		nVidia FX 5200
2006-04-08T15:50:00.000Z	CountZ		I have an nvidia geforce 6600, hope it works
2006-04-08T15:51:00.000Z	CountZ		I installed ubuntu under vmware so it detected the display adapter as 'vmware', how do I reconfigure xorg?
2006-04-08T15:51:00.000Z	CountZ		(and tell it that I have an nvidia card)
2006-04-08T15:51:00.000Z	matthinckley	CountZ	6600 will work, but you can't run Xgl under VMware
2006-04-08T15:51:00.000Z	CountZ	matthinckley	i'm not trying to run xgl under vmware
2006-04-08T15:52:00.000Z	CountZ	matthinckley	I only used vmware to install it on an external drive, cuz I don't have a burner
2006-04-08T15:52:00.000Z	matthinckley	CountZ	oh ok.. what are you trying to reconfigure xorg under vmware?
2006-04-08T15:52:00.000Z	CountZ		but now when I boot into linux, it still sees the vmware device and GPM fails to load
2006-04-08T15:52:00.000Z	CountZ		no i'm trying to reconfigure it from straight linux, not emulated
2006-04-08T15:53:00.000Z	matthinckley	CountZ	oh have you tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ?
