2008-10-12T00:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	id give audacity a try
2008-10-12T00:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	audacity is a sound manipulation program so if you can use it properly im sure it will achieve what you want
2008-11-04T01:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	if its a module to load run: gksudo gedit /etc/modules
2008-11-04T01:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	and add it there
2008-11-04T01:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	you can add all the modules to be loaded there
2009-03-17T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	flash is proprietary format to Adobe so a flash creator would need to be made by adobe to be useful, there may be a best effort one some place
2009-06-28T05:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	they will run it fine, hardware is discussed in offtopic or #hardware
2009-06-28T05:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	this channel is for people having issues with ubuntu only
2009-07-28T14:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	the ubuntu community support is pretty decent
2009-07-28T14:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	afaik, its the same. tbf, if all you need is a file sharing server then any distro will do
2009-07-28T14:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	what sort of server is it?
2009-07-28T14:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	if you are comfortable with debian server then i'd say stick with it
2010-03-21T02:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	bum may be able to help but its a bit weird now that things are changing
2010-03-21T02:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	it can be used as such, yes
2010-03-21T02:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	remember to put &s on the ends of commands so the system wil still run while the app runs in the background
2010-03-21T02:30:00.000Z	extor	ActionParsnip	damn...I need & at the end of commands in that file??? It's not a scriptfile???
2010-03-21T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	it is pretty much a script file but without the whole system will sit until the command finishes
2010-03-21T02:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	sure but as I said, if yu dont background a command the system will wait until it completes
2011-04-09T16:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	try:  lsof | grep something       change 'something' to something like the mount point or somesuch, also make sure your pwd is NOT in the mount point as this will lock it too
2011-11-02T10:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	extor	I suggest a clean install. You will get a much cleaner OS and you will get there faster
2011-11-02T10:46:00.000Z	extor	ActionParsnip	problem with a clean install is that this is an openvz template we are talking about that is configured to run Xvnc and I'm not sure I can configure xvnc in a fresh install since I'm not vnc savvy
