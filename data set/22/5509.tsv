2007-05-23T09:50:00.000Z	rausb0	obsethryl	okay. i just tried to connect to port 47221 of your router.
2007-05-23T09:53:00.000Z	obsethryl	rausb0	you did what?
2007-05-23T09:53:00.000Z	obsethryl	rausb0	you did what?
2007-05-23T09:53:00.000Z	rausb0	obsethryl	nc your_routers_ip_address 47221
2007-05-23T09:56:00.000Z	obsethryl	rausb0	sorry but what you are connecting to, has nothing to do with me :)
2007-05-23T09:57:00.000Z	rausb0	obsethryl	so pool-70-21-196-147.nwrk.east.verizon.net is not your router's public address?
2007-05-23T09:57:00.000Z	obsethryl	rausb0	nope
2007-05-23T09:57:00.000Z	rausb0	obsethryl	okay
2007-05-23T09:57:00.000Z	obsethryl	rausb0	but how have you concluded that it might be me?
2007-05-23T09:58:00.000Z	obsethryl	rausb0	;)
2007-05-23T10:01:00.000Z	obsethryl	rausb0	or to be honest, make decisions for you
2007-05-23T10:02:00.000Z	rausb0	obsethryl	yes
2007-05-23T10:02:00.000Z	obsethryl	rausb0	perhaps he could have better luck with something like guarddog though, if he wants gui interfaces
2007-05-23T10:02:00.000Z	rausb0	obsethryl	i don't know either. i use my own iptables rule set.
2007-05-23T10:02:00.000Z	obsethryl	rausb0	yah same here
2007-05-23T10:09:00.000Z	rausb0	obsethryl	people are just a bit more patient here :)
2007-05-23T10:09:00.000Z	obsethryl	rausb0	hmm well, i would not say patient, i would say polite
2007-05-23T10:10:00.000Z	obsethryl	rausb0	in debian you have trolling for no purpose; you ask for one thing and get another and if they cannot respond to a SIMPLE question (where do i find a particular debian graphical resource, like a wallpaper for example) they start becoming more aolified than their notorious and insulting !aolify trigger
2007-05-23T10:11:00.000Z	rausb0	obsethryl	well maybe it's because people here have no problem saying "i don't know" if they cannot answer a question
2007-05-23T10:12:00.000Z	obsethryl	rausb0	maybe so, but so far logs say that everyone gets to solve his/her issues
2007-05-23T10:13:00.000Z	rausb0	obsethryl	well, only if he/she is giving enough information. and getting this info from a newbie who is totally lost can be painful sometimes.
2007-05-23T10:16:00.000Z	obsethryl	rausb0	ok, last call though for me since i have to go: nobody has the right to assume things about you if they have never seen you before; their only right is to criticise the answer, not the question, given the fact that the question comes from somebody in the homo sapiens sapiens species and it readily articulate and to the point. Missing information is a relative issue since the key issue here is knowing what you want to do first; the rest
