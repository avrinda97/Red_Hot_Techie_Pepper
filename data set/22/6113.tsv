2006-12-25T13:05:00.000Z	dv_		installing windows isnt trivial, most people stick with the preinstalled versions
2006-12-25T13:06:00.000Z	dv_		suse will be there sooner however.
2006-12-25T13:08:00.000Z	dv_		this is why suse has mp3 etc. but ubuntu doesnt
2006-12-25T13:09:00.000Z	dv_		yes
2006-12-25T13:09:00.000Z	dv_		which is a good thing, suse is one of the most popular distros, so its good to have mp3 support
2006-12-25T13:10:00.000Z	dv_		oh sorry
2006-12-25T13:11:00.000Z	dv_		anyway, if joe sixpack wants to hear his mp3s, and "that linux thing" doesnt play them, then linux is shitty software in his opinion, and he will tell everyone how shitty linux is and recommends windows
2006-12-25T13:12:00.000Z	dv_		but isnt it possible to have a GUI with a "I agree to the license agreements" box?
2006-12-25T13:12:00.000Z	dv_		so one has to agree to the mp3 license to install the software?
2006-12-25T13:13:00.000Z	dv_		I see that ubuntu is floss, but it should be unnecessarily hard to install support for mp3 and mpeg4
2006-12-25T13:13:00.000Z	un_operateur	dv_	it would mean that ubuntu might have to pay to use a license to use those non-free formats -- which it clearly does not want -- also it has to do with the fact that there are 100% open alternatives to most multimedia formats which ubuntu (like other distros) is keen to see being used
2006-12-25T13:14:00.000Z	dv_	un_operateur	now technically you have to install lame yourself because this way ubuntu isnt distributing mp3 software
2006-12-25T13:14:00.000Z	dv_	un_operateur	but cant this be automated by said click on the "I agree to the agreements" button?
2006-12-25T13:14:00.000Z	un_operateur	dv_	exactly, but ubuntu will play .ogg's fine -- do you see what i mean?
2006-12-25T13:15:00.000Z	un_operateur	dv_	that would mean that ubuntu CDs will have to include packages that support mp3s -- but it does not want to be tied in licensing and legal issues, so it just does not do it
2006-12-25T13:15:00.000Z	dv_	un_operateur	no, not on the CDs
2006-12-25T13:15:00.000Z	dv_		you press the button and it downloads lame
2006-12-25T13:16:00.000Z	un_operateur	dv_	its not a matter of user's accepting the "agreements" .. its about canonical itself not wanting to be tied with any "agreements" with vendors of non-free formats
2006-12-25T13:20:00.000Z	un_operateur	dv_	but is it a non-free de-facto standard, is that hard to see?? :)
2006-12-25T13:26:00.000Z	un_operateur	dv_	I think you just havent begun to see the whole philosophy of open-source yet?? There's plenty of good software out there that does just what you want, it's free, exclusive of licensing and legal issues and is well supported, why go against all these marvels and use something non-free and tied to intellectual property legalities??
2006-12-25T13:28:00.000Z	un_operateur	dv_	getting ubuntu to support mp3s by default is lalmost like saying ubuntu ought to support M$ office's .XLS and .DOC files by default, just why the should they?
2006-12-25T13:29:00.000Z	un_operateur	dv_	is starting to resemble a troll now -- i think he needs to be put out of his misery
