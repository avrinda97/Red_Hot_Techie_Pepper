2006-07-28T12:45:00.000Z	DarkED		hey all
2006-07-28T12:45:00.000Z	DarkED		question, i want to move this ubuntu install to a smaller partition
2006-07-28T12:45:00.000Z	DarkED		theres plenty of space free, can i just copy and paste it?
2006-07-28T12:46:00.000Z	bruenig	DarkED	why not resize your current partition and incorporate the free space in the other partition, assuming the partitions are next to each other
2006-07-28T12:46:00.000Z	DarkED	bruenig	they arent :D
2006-07-28T13:35:00.000Z	bruenig	DarkED	I would backup the stuff that I want to keep, it could be almost everything. Install a fresh version on the other partition and then just add the other stuff. Afterwards. Backup the /home dir. the /usr directory whatever you want and then just put that into a fresh install
2006-07-28T13:36:00.000Z	DarkED	bruenig	i need my installed packages to stay the same :D
2006-07-28T13:36:00.000Z	bruenig	DarkED	you could do that in theory. Just keep everything from the directories you have installed it from. Like /usr
2006-07-28T13:36:00.000Z	DarkED	bruenig	i see
2006-07-28T13:38:00.000Z	DarkED	bruenig	yeah, but i just want to mirror this partition to another, change the grub menu.lst, and boot into it :D
2006-07-28T13:38:00.000Z	bruenig	DarkED	just overwrite everything with the other partition
2006-07-28T13:38:00.000Z	DarkED	bruenig	i tried, it wont lemme do some things in the /sys folder
2006-07-28T13:38:00.000Z	DarkED	bruenig	says i dont have permissions to read, even as root
2006-07-28T13:39:00.000Z	bruenig	DarkED	this seems the most reasonable way to do it. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=35087&highlight=backup+restore
2006-07-28T13:42:00.000Z	DarkED	bruenig	ok, it says to exclude /sys. you say to not exclude anything. what is in /proc and /sys?
2006-07-28T13:44:00.000Z	bruenig	DarkED	hopefully you have something that will hold that massive fle
2006-07-28T13:45:00.000Z	DarkED	bruenig	i have the target partition setup already, its smaller than this one, but large enough
2006-07-28T13:45:00.000Z	bruenig	DarkED	are you going to fresh install or just copy over all of the files?
2006-07-28T13:46:00.000Z	DarkED	bruenig	no no, im moving this ubuntu install from its old partition to an empty partition
2006-07-28T13:46:00.000Z	bruenig	DarkED	by which I mean, are you going to fresh install and then overwrite or just copy over to a blank partition.
2006-07-28T13:47:00.000Z	DarkED	bruenig	then im gonna format this partition and install fedora 5 on it, only reason im doing it is b/c this is the larger partition and i cant resize and fedora needs this space
2006-07-28T13:47:00.000Z	bruenig	DarkED	i am interested to see if that will work. And as far as the permissions are concerned all the permissions should be retained according to this part of the how to "
