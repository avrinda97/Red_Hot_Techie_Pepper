2005-02-19T11:56:00.000Z	tritium	ArdieM	using alien and rpms is not very advisable for that very reason
2005-02-19T11:57:00.000Z	tritium	ArdieM	you'll end up with a broken package if you force overwrite
2005-02-19T11:59:00.000Z	ArdieM	tritium	you got a link ?
2005-02-19T11:59:00.000Z	tritium	ArdieM	just enable restricted, universe, and multiverse in Hoary.
2005-02-19T11:59:00.000Z	tritium	ArdieM	then apt-cache search fglrx
2005-02-19T12:01:00.000Z	tritium	ArdieM	xorg
