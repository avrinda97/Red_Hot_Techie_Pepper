2011-07-01T13:10:00.000Z	Danny__		Resetting the router didn't work
2011-07-01T13:11:00.000Z	Danny__		Yes
2011-07-01T13:11:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	I doubt the router is the issue, the router served up the dns primary, its working
2011-07-01T13:13:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	not sure, you have an ip, and a working dns, I pinged it, its up
2011-07-01T13:13:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	you tried getting out again via browser?
2011-07-01T13:15:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	you have something else that connects to the internet? something like music ????? anything not browser related?
2011-07-01T13:16:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	open a terminal and ping that dns
2011-07-01T13:18:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	ping google.com
2011-07-01T13:19:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	it was or it was not, you get a ping response?
2011-07-01T13:20:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	in order to ping google.com dns has to be working
2011-07-01T13:21:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	you can connect, you can't browse, two different issues
2011-07-01T13:22:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	did you play with the setting on the browser?
2011-07-01T13:23:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	play with proxy settings?
2011-07-01T13:29:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	did you try to install a firewall on the machine with the issue/?
2011-07-01T13:30:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	could have shared that
2011-07-01T13:31:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	which?
2011-07-01T13:31:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	and is it now installed?
2011-07-01T13:32:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	unless you want to figure out what is wrong with firestarter, yes
2011-07-01T13:34:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	get back to virgin state, firestarter asks some questions on install as I remember, those questions need to be answered correctly
2011-07-01T13:36:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	no, first un-install, don't re-install, see if that fixes your issues
2011-07-01T13:37:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	you own the router you are on? or, you can make changes to it?
2011-07-01T13:38:00.000Z	almoxarife	Danny__	be nice, next time, spill the beans
