2006-05-25T15:40:00.000Z	gdb		I don't care for Debian's library of CDs and I'm sort of tired of Fedora's development cycle so I'm looking for something I can be comfortable with.  So far, I'm liking Ubuntu and I'm looking forward to it getting up to speed on some of the newer techologies.  And I'm patient about it. :-)
2006-05-25T15:42:00.000Z	gdb		Yeah, I like how root is locked by default.
2006-05-25T15:42:00.000Z	gdb		So simply setting a password will cause the system to enforce its entry when booting single user mode.
2006-05-25T15:43:00.000Z	gdb		Thanks!
2006-05-25T15:43:00.000Z	gdb		Like I said, I'm new to the Debian-like (and thus Ubuntu) way of doing things coming from a Red Hat background (and before that Slackware and NetBSD).  It's a fun learning experience. :-)
2006-05-25T15:43:00.000Z	gdb		Have to find something new to do with it starts to get boring. ;-)
2006-05-25T15:44:00.000Z	gdb		That being said, your own account is a root password on ubuntu.
2006-05-25T15:45:00.000Z	gdb		Since you're in the admin group and they only need know YOUR password to "sudo exec bash --login"
2006-05-25T15:46:00.000Z	gdb		Hell, you can go afk and someone can do that without your password if you've recently used sudo to run a root command.
2006-05-25T15:46:00.000Z	gdb		Regardless, I like the Ubuntu paradigm of locking root by default and dropping the first user into group admin with ALL=ALL(ALL) sudo privledges.
2006-05-25T15:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	gdb	you could set your sudo timeout to zero minutes, if you really wanted to. (it would get pretty irritating, though...)
2006-05-25T15:47:00.000Z	gdb	Madpilot	indeed. lol
2006-05-25T15:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	gdb	ubotu
2006-05-25T15:50:00.000Z	gdb	Madpilot	are these metapackages documented somewhere?
2006-05-25T15:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	gdb	no idea, tbh...
2006-06-19T14:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	gdb	with 2Gb RAM, you don't need swap at all, really
2006-06-19T14:41:00.000Z	gdb	Madpilot	In general, no, I think the system has swapped out all of 25MB since it was set up. lol
2006-06-19T14:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	gdb	I've only got 1Gb, never bothered with swap, never really needed it
2006-06-19T14:42:00.000Z	gdb	Madpilot	Most likely those were processes that had not requested cycles in quite some time so the system swapped them out for efficiency, not because the machine was starved for RAM.
2006-06-19T14:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	gdb	funny, but offtopic
2006-06-19T14:44:00.000Z	gdb	Madpilot	I'm glad you're here to tell me these kinds of things.
2006-06-19T14:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	gdb	I'm an op, it's what we do :)
