2008-05-03T19:02:00.000Z	John_S		What's a better search tool than the gnome-search-tool? i.e. one that will search hidden files/folders? And is there one that is similar to the command "locate", where it can search thru a database of your files?
2008-05-03T19:04:00.000Z	cwillu	John_S	there should be an option "Show hidden and backup files"
2008-05-03T19:05:00.000Z	John_S	cwillu	Yes, but even when I enable that, it still won't search in my .folders.
2008-05-03T19:05:00.000Z	cwillu	John_S	:/ you're right
2008-05-03T19:05:00.000Z	John_S	cwillu	Must be a bug. Wish they would fix it!
2008-05-03T19:05:00.000Z	cwillu	John_S	I think tracker has an option to handle that, but I don't know for sure (not running it right now)
2008-05-03T19:06:00.000Z	John_S	cwillu	Yes, trident523 recommended tracker, I'm going to give it a try.
2008-05-03T19:07:00.000Z	cwillu	John_S	trident523, I just got gnome to search it!
2008-05-03T19:08:00.000Z	cwillu	John_S	give me a sec to nail down which option it was
2008-05-03T19:08:00.000Z	cwillu	John_S	okay, open the places | search
2008-05-03T19:09:00.000Z	cwillu	John_S	select more options | and select show hidden and backup files.  And then (important!) hit the add button :p
2008-05-03T19:09:00.000Z	cwillu	John_S	got that?
2008-05-03T19:11:00.000Z	John_S	cwillu	Yes, and I could swear I hit the "add" button originally, but I guess not, because I just tried it again. Thanks for finding my mistake! :)
2008-05-03T19:11:00.000Z	cwillu	John_S	that's fine, I did exactly the same thing :p
2008-05-03T19:14:00.000Z	cwillu	John_S	by default, it doesn't search across file systems
2008-05-03T19:14:00.000Z	cwillu	John_S	there's another option to enable searching across filesystems
2008-05-03T19:15:00.000Z	John_S	cwillu	It unfortunately does I think, because if I search at root level / then it finds the mounted partition in /mnt/hda1. Correct?
2008-05-03T19:16:00.000Z	cwillu	John_S	which, gnome search?
2008-05-03T19:16:00.000Z	John_S	cwillu	Just the Places > Search for Files (the gnome-search-tool)
2008-05-03T19:19:00.000Z	cwillu	John_S	by default, locate doesn't include anything in /media, and the gnome tool doesn't cross device boundaries by default
2008-05-03T19:19:00.000Z	cwillu	John_S	in gconf-editor, apps | gnome-search, you can specifically blacklist dirs, but I don't think it's needed
2008-05-03T19:21:00.000Z	John_S	cwillu	OK, I see it in the gconf-editor. Thanks for clarifying that. :)
