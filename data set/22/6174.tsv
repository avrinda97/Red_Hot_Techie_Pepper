2007-01-10T10:05:00.000Z	lovloss		Im sorry to be such a bother... i cant find out how much processor speed my motherboard can handle for an upgrade. The sites arent helping.
2007-01-10T10:05:00.000Z	shorty114	lovloss	you mean overclocking or a new processor?
2007-01-10T10:05:00.000Z	lovloss	shorty114	 I want to get a  new processor :)
2007-01-10T10:06:00.000Z	lovloss	shorty114	because mine is 1.5 ghz...
2007-01-10T10:06:00.000Z	shorty114	lovloss	well, it's not so much speed as processor gen
2007-01-10T10:06:00.000Z	shorty114	lovloss	it may take a P4
2007-01-10T10:06:00.000Z	lovloss	shorty114	no, its an AMD board
2007-01-10T10:06:00.000Z	shorty114	lovloss	oh, well, then i'm at a loss there :)
2007-01-10T10:06:00.000Z	lovloss	shorty114	The compatible names are Sempron, Duron, Athlon
2007-01-10T10:07:00.000Z	shorty114	lovloss	any of those should be fine
2007-01-10T10:07:00.000Z	shorty114	lovloss	at any speed
2007-01-10T10:07:00.000Z	lovloss	shorty114	really?
2007-01-10T10:07:00.000Z	shorty114	lovloss	yeah, speed is only how fast the chip is clocked
2007-01-10T10:08:00.000Z	lovloss	shorty114	I see... i just need to figure out whether or not to get another board in the process you see. im very very poor.
2007-01-10T10:08:00.000Z	shorty114	lovloss	you should be fine
2007-01-10T10:09:00.000Z	lovloss	shorty114	I mean, its not a *bad* board is it? it handles 3 gigs of memory, has 8 usb conenctors and boots from usb... i think its pretty decent huh?
2007-01-10T10:09:00.000Z	shorty114	lovloss	heh, 3 GB of memory is nothing these days
2007-01-10T10:09:00.000Z	shorty114	lovloss	but for 70 bucks i'd say it's good :)
2007-01-10T10:09:00.000Z	lovloss	shorty114	I only have 1 ^_^ i didnt know anyone had more than 2
2007-01-10T10:10:00.000Z	shorty114	lovloss	you can get 32 GB on some mobo's
2007-01-10T10:10:00.000Z	lovloss	shorty114	Just as long as i dont plug in a brand new shiny processor and find it underclocked to 1.6 ghz again
2007-01-10T10:10:00.000Z	lovloss	shorty114	holy cow
