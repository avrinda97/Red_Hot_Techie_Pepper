2005-04-12T09:07:00.000Z	crimsun	Xeon3D	they're already installed.
2005-04-12T09:07:00.000Z	crimsun	Xeon3D	http://wiki.ubuntulinux.org/BinaryDriverHowto
2005-05-04T09:14:00.000Z	crimsun	Xeon3D	yes, you can use spdif with the in-kernel alsa drivers
2005-05-04T09:15:00.000Z	Xeon3D	crimsun	care to explain how or redirect me to a webpage?
2005-05-04T09:15:00.000Z	crimsun	Xeon3D	-Dplug:iec958
2005-05-04T09:15:00.000Z	Xeon3D	crimsun	please ellaborate
2005-05-04T09:15:00.000Z	crimsun	Xeon3D	the alsa device you use is plug:iec958
2005-05-04T09:15:00.000Z	crimsun	Xeon3D	therefore you must also unmute and adjust the iec958 playback mixer elements (not the capture ones)
2005-05-04T09:16:00.000Z	crimsun	Xeon3D	wherever you can select an alsa device
2005-05-04T09:17:00.000Z	crimsun	Xeon3D	use alsamixer from a terminal
2005-05-04T09:18:00.000Z	Xeon3D	crimsun	ok. I got them all on and volume on maximum, but the Dolby Digital Line LED on my speakers hasn't got lit yet.
2005-05-04T09:19:00.000Z	crimsun	Xeon3D	you can't turn them _all_ on
2005-05-04T09:22:00.000Z	Xeon3D	crimsun	http://pastebin.com/274823
2005-05-04T09:24:00.000Z	Xeon3D	crimsun	so?
2005-05-04T09:24:00.000Z	crimsun	Xeon3D	play with the mixer settings
2005-05-04T09:25:00.000Z	crimsun	Xeon3D	the ones you're interested in are Surround and Analog to IEC958
2005-05-04T09:28:00.000Z	Xeon3D	crimsun	does it save as soon as I exit alsamixer?
2005-05-04T09:29:00.000Z	crimsun	Xeon3D	settings are saved when you issue a reboot command and restored after you finish booting
2005-05-04T09:30:00.000Z	crimsun	Xeon3D	no
2005-05-04T09:30:00.000Z	crimsun	Xeon3D	you need to check the url I just gave discord
