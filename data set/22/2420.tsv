2009-06-15T11:47:00.000Z	james7		i want to do that
2009-06-15T11:48:00.000Z	indus	james7	no i dont
2009-06-15T11:38:00.000Z	james7	indus	that could be resolved if ubuntu fix the bug of installing a new version over the older and not loosing everything or having to backup
2009-06-15T11:38:00.000Z	james7	indus	i hope they fix that with ubuntu 9.10.. so i dont need to erase 9.04 and install everything all over again
2009-06-15T11:39:00.000Z	indus	james7	hmmm ? i installed over 8.10 and its fine
2009-06-15T11:39:00.000Z	indus	james7	what went wrong with yours?
2009-06-15T11:39:00.000Z	james7	indus	is not just me.. a lot of people had the same problem..
2009-06-15T11:39:00.000Z	james7	indus	you was lucky i guess
2009-06-15T11:40:00.000Z	james7	indus	it just didnt work.. and everything was running kind of slow. didnt feel the same. after i install it all from scratch.. it feels very different now
2009-06-15T11:40:00.000Z	indus	james7	you need to file bugs as much as possible because this is the preferred method of upgrade and they aim to perfect it
2009-06-15T11:40:00.000Z	indus	james7	i know even iam thinking of doing it from scratch and going back to hardy :)
2009-06-15T11:41:00.000Z	james7	indus	why hardy?
