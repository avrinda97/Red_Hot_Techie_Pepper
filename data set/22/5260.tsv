2007-06-29T06:52:00.000Z	kbrooks	Pirate_Hunter	they DID.
2007-06-29T06:52:00.000Z	kbrooks	Pirate_Hunter	what gives you the impression they didn't?
2007-06-29T06:53:00.000Z	kbrooks	Pirate_Hunter	they can't just slap swap on another partition.
2007-06-29T06:54:00.000Z	kbrooks	Pirate_Hunter	they have to adapt to backwards compatibility.
2007-06-29T06:54:00.000Z	kbrooks	Pirate_Hunter	and that means putting the swap on the main windows  partition.
2007-06-29T06:55:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	kbrooks	so thats how they do it I see, no wonder i didnt notice it
2007-06-29T06:55:00.000Z	kbrooks	Pirate_Hunter	it is "better" than removing files and resizing.
2007-06-29T06:55:00.000Z	kbrooks	Pirate_Hunter	but the solution is much worser than a dedicated swap partition.
2007-06-29T06:57:00.000Z	kbrooks	Pirate_Hunter	by "dedicated swap partition", i don't mean FAT32 with the pagefile slapped on it, which BTW is horribly inefficient
2007-06-29T06:58:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	kbrooks	hmm FAT32 how cool it was when it came out
2007-06-29T06:59:00.000Z	kbrooks	Pirate_Hunter	only because it utilized the increased space
2007-06-29T07:00:00.000Z	kbrooks	Pirate_Hunter	in general, it is much better to create a _swap partition_ on any OS than to create a swap file over a existing filesystem. but shucks for the OSes that don't have dedicated swap partitions... </rant>
2007-06-29T07:00:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	kbrooks	see i learn new things everyday :-)
2007-06-29T07:01:00.000Z	kbrooks	Pirate_Hunter	yes, but it will be slower
2007-06-29T07:01:00.000Z	kbrooks	Pirate_Hunter	vmware uses multiple ways to make the virtualization go "fast", so to speak.
2007-06-29T07:01:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	kbrooks	& mwe: damn I see I guess will have to fork up for more ram than... I was hoping to use that PC as my testing area for linux
2007-06-29T07:03:00.000Z	kbrooks	Pirate_Hunter	with each purchase of RAM, you're helping the prices decrease.
2007-06-29T07:03:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	kbrooks	:-) lol nice way to look at it rofl
2007-06-29T07:03:00.000Z	kbrooks	Pirate_Hunter	so, don't be too stingy - RAM is expensive for a reason.
2008-02-18T02:12:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	kbrooks	hmm Ieven knowing it failed what i was attempting I wouldve thought you would understand instead of making me read that msg and oh yes if you havent figured out than you should read what that person posted beofre doing what you did
2008-02-18T02:13:00.000Z	kbrooks	Pirate_Hunter	i'm sorry?
2008-02-18T02:13:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	kbrooks	np
