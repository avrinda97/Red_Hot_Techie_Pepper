2009-08-17T20:28:00.000Z	n3glv		how goes it for ATI mobile radeon support on 9.04?
2009-08-17T20:29:00.000Z	n3glv		oh ok, it was not advised that I upgrade, also it's ubuntu 64bit, if that matters
2009-08-17T20:29:00.000Z	jMyles_	n3glv	Which radeon do you have?  I recently found that switching to 16-bit color depth drastically, unbelievably increased my performance at everything.  Doubled the speed of my laptop.  I have a Radeon M7500
2009-08-17T20:29:00.000Z	n3glv		k
2009-08-17T20:29:00.000Z	n3glv		toshiba t305d-s8818 I think is the laptop

2009-08-17T20:31:00.000Z	n3glv		does that help?
2009-08-17T20:31:00.000Z	n3glv		I think it's a 9500
2009-08-17T20:31:00.000Z	n3glv	jMyles_	so you say go for the upgrade?
2009-08-17T20:32:00.000Z	jMyles_	n3glv	From Intrepid to Jaunty?  Yeah, go for it.  64-bit Jaunty is especially solid.
