2012-05-22T22:18:00.000Z	muh2000		how can i edit the adressbar in 12.04?
2012-05-22T22:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	muh2000	address bar of what? Firefox? Thunar? Chromium????
2012-05-22T22:19:00.000Z	muh2000	ActionParsnip	file browser for broswing network shares that are hidden...
2012-09-10T14:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	muh2000	the default instaleer installs a lot of apps, the mini ISO hardly installs anything
2012-09-10T14:17:00.000Z	muh2000	ActionParsnip	i asked for a way to install from cli since the gui installer does not work. i did not ask for different flavours...
2012-09-10T14:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	muh2000	its not a different flavour at all, its an installer that installs kernel, boot loader and some package tools
2012-09-10T14:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	muh2000	no DE, WM, DM etc, just CLI, less than server
2012-09-10T14:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	muh2000	you can then install what you wish and build the OS up
2012-09-10T14:18:00.000Z	muh2000	ActionParsnip	yeah but i have ONE ubuntu install image. i have no other ways of installing right now... and all i need is a way to install it.
2012-09-10T14:19:00.000Z	muh2000	ActionParsnip	please start reading what i wrote... i didnt look for a minimum install. just an alternative for the failing gui installer
2012-09-10T14:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	muh2000	use the alternate installer then, it installs in text mode but gives a desktop OS
2012-09-10T14:20:00.000Z	muh2000	ActionParsnip	no access to the alternate installer.
2012-09-10T14:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	muh2000	did you update ubiquity in the liveCD OS before running it?
2012-09-10T14:20:00.000Z	muh2000	ActionParsnip	no?
2012-09-10T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	muh2000	 so it's the latest version before you run it, obviously
2012-09-10T14:21:00.000Z	muh2000	ActionParsnip	well duh but shouldnt any version be sufficient? i figure since they released the livecd of the LTS ....
2012-09-10T14:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	muh2000	there may be updates which fix issues, its worth doing
2012-09-10T14:23:00.000Z	muh2000	ActionParsnip	well it complains about having not enough space.... well no wonder when it is running in ram...
2012-09-10T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	muh2000	when you downloaded the ISO, did you MD5 test it before you used it?
2012-09-10T14:25:00.000Z	muh2000	ActionParsnip	yes
2012-09-10T14:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	muh2000	you could try the daily ISO, if one exists
