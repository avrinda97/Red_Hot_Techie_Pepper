2008-01-15T09:10:00.000Z	erawfish	firefoxIE	it allows you to install firefox
2008-01-15T09:11:00.000Z	erawfish	firefoxIE	synaptic is what you use to install programs in ubuntu
2008-01-15T09:18:00.000Z	erawfish	firefoxIE	there is no point for the firefox website for you. use synaptic already
2008-01-15T09:25:00.000Z	erawfish	firefoxIE	yes
2008-01-15T09:37:00.000Z	erawfish	firefoxIE	do you have a CD burner?
2008-01-15T09:37:00.000Z	erawfish	firefoxIE	then download the ISO from ubuntu.com and burn your own (if you want)
2008-01-15T09:41:00.000Z	erawfish	firefoxIE	yes and no
2008-01-15T09:44:00.000Z	erawfish	firefoxIE	you can do it manually but you don't know enough to actually install and configure it
2008-01-15T09:44:00.000Z	erawfish	firefoxIE	and asking us is OT here
2008-01-15T09:45:00.000Z	firefoxIE	erawfish	what do u mean by OT ?
2008-01-15T09:46:00.000Z	erawfish	firefoxIE	no I mean asking how to install stuff manually in feisty that way is OT

2008-01-15T09:54:00.000Z	erawfish	firefoxIE	ubuntu is a bit more common probably in the case of ubuntu
