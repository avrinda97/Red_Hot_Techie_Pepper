2011-09-30T23:06:00.000Z	usr13	pepito	cat /etc/resolv.conf  | pastebinit
2011-09-30T23:07:00.000Z	pepito	usr13	i ll tell you now, i ve checked that file dozen of times, two nameservers with 2 ip addresses that are the DNS servers of my ISP
2011-09-30T23:07:00.000Z	pepito	usr13	two "nameserver" lines i mean
2011-09-30T23:07:00.000Z	usr13	pepito	Can you ping them both?
2011-09-30T23:08:00.000Z	pepito	usr13	yes
2011-09-30T23:10:00.000Z	pepito	usr13	it hadnt occurred to me to ping them before, i tried and i cant
2011-09-30T23:11:00.000Z	usr13	pepito	If  you can't ping them, you can't resolve domain names
2011-09-30T23:12:00.000Z	pepito	usr13	its resolving, but extremely slowly
2011-09-30T23:12:00.000Z	usr13	pepito	Is the first one not pinging?
2011-09-30T23:12:00.000Z	usr13	pepito	How many do you have?  1 or 2 or?
2011-09-30T23:13:00.000Z	pepito	usr13	i ve 2, neither ping
2011-09-30T23:13:00.000Z	pepito	usr13	it sends a packet ubt i dont get a reply
2011-09-30T23:14:00.000Z	usr13	pepito	What is your ISP?  What do they recommend for nameservers?
2011-09-30T23:14:00.000Z	usr13	pepito	See my PM
2011-09-30T23:15:00.000Z	pepito	usr13	european ISP, i just asked a friend who is on linux and has the same ISP and name servers, and he says he cant ping them either
2011-09-30T23:15:00.000Z	usr13	pepito	run nmap against them to see if port 53 is open
2011-09-30T23:16:00.000Z	usr13	pepito	nmap -p 53 4.2.2.2   #Where 4.2.2.2 is the actual nameserver you are supposed to be using.
