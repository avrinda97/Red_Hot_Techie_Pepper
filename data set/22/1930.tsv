2010-01-10T08:39:00.000Z	sje46		if I move a bunch of files across to a Windows partition from Linux, will that info still be on the Linux partition?
2010-01-10T08:39:00.000Z	sje46		what are the options?
2010-01-10T08:41:00.000Z	Quan-Time	sje46	if you mount the partition, you will see the files on yoru windows partiton
2010-01-10T08:41:00.000Z	Quan-Time	sje46	often you have to mount the NTFS partiton,, look into NTFS-3g
2010-01-10T08:42:00.000Z	Quan-Time	sje46	yes, you can do that and run prorams from it if you choose.. BUT be careful of permissions and what not
2010-01-10T08:42:00.000Z	sje46	Quan-Time	my question is if the info on the harddrive will still be recoverable on the windows partition
2010-01-10T08:43:00.000Z	Quan-Time	sje46	yer of course, windows will see it without issue..
2010-01-10T08:43:00.000Z	Quan-Time	sje46	i run steam that way.. so linux or windows can use it.. saves on install space :)
2010-01-10T08:44:00.000Z	sje46	Quan-Time	I'm confused.  My linux can see windows files fine.  I'm asking ...like, you know how when you delete something, it doesn't delete the data, just the pointer?
2010-01-10T08:44:00.000Z	Quan-Time	sje46	if you delete something from your windows partition, while in linux.. it will be deleted. when you boot to windows, it will be gone
2010-01-10T08:45:00.000Z	sje46	Quan-Time	pretend I have one OS.  Just Windows.  Or Linux.  Doesn't matter.  If you have a file, and delete it, that information is stil on the disk until something writes it over.
2010-01-10T08:46:00.000Z	Quan-Time	sje46	correct.
2010-01-10T08:46:00.000Z	Quan-Time	sje46	BUT the pointer file (FAT info) ISNT moved to the recycle bin for easy access.. you manually have to run some sort of undelete / unerase program to rebuild it
2010-01-10T08:48:00.000Z	sje46	Quan-Time	okay, so when I move a file from a linux partition to a windows partition, I'd have to wipe it from the linux partition if I don't want it to be there anymore
2010-01-10T08:49:00.000Z	sje46	Quan-Time	I don't think it's bios if he can't use the CD at all
2010-01-10T08:50:00.000Z	Quan-Time	sje46	umm. if you MOVE it, it tells the FAT (file allocation table) taht the space can now be overwritten.. you dont have to actively "scrub" it. if you move it, your all set
2010-01-10T08:50:00.000Z	Quan-Time	sje46	OH... is the CD burnt in a bootable way ? i had to deal with someone about this issue previously
2010-01-10T08:50:00.000Z	sje46	Quan-Time	I don't have to scrub it, but I want to.
2010-01-10T08:52:00.000Z	Quan-Time	sje46	ok.. there is a "secure erase" option.. so it writes all blank space (FFFFFFxFF) over it... a move is "copy, delete".. a secure move / secure delete is "delete, write over it with blank space"..
2010-01-10T08:53:00.000Z	Quan-Time	sje46	if you do it via nautilus, if you "empty" your recycle bin, sorta does the same thing
2010-01-10T08:53:00.000Z	Quan-Time	sje46	yup, wipe is good
2010-01-10T08:55:00.000Z	sje46	Quan-Time	so I think I should just copy all the files to the Windows partition, and then wipe all them from the Ubuntu partition
