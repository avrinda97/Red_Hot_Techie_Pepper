2007-12-20T18:47:00.000Z	snkmad		need help, after yesterday kernel update, my ubuntu 7.10 doesnt boot, grub cant find the partition
2007-12-20T18:49:00.000Z	RatThing	snkmad	is the hard drive problematic, have you had trouble with it before the upgrade?
2007-12-20T18:49:00.000Z	snkmad		then it asked me to reboot
2007-12-20T18:49:00.000Z	snkmad		the HHD is fine, im using winxp on the other partition on the same drive
2007-12-20T18:50:00.000Z	RatThing	snkmad	I take it then you are unable to go into safe mode when grub boots up, recovery mode that is.
2007-12-20T18:51:00.000Z	snkmad	RatThing	yeah cant go into safe mode either
2007-12-20T18:51:00.000Z	snkmad		ill try to boot into my livecd later
2007-12-20T18:51:00.000Z	snkmad		just wanna know what should i do, and if my partition is lost?
2007-12-20T18:52:00.000Z	RatThing	snkmad	do you actually see a Grub message?
2007-12-20T18:52:00.000Z	snkmad		yeah
2007-12-20T18:52:00.000Z	snkmad		grub appears, with all normal boot options
2007-12-20T18:52:00.000Z	snkmad		and if i choose any of the ubuntu ones
2007-12-20T18:52:00.000Z	RatThing	snkmad	did you install xp after you upgraded?
2007-12-20T18:52:00.000Z	snkmad		itll tell something like partition not found, cant remember the exact message
2007-12-20T18:53:00.000Z	snkmad	RatThing	no, i had winxp, then installed 7.10 just when it was out, then never booted xp again, was full time linux
2007-12-20T18:53:00.000Z	snkmad		its really weird using winxp again...
2007-12-20T18:54:00.000Z	RatThing	snkmad	there are some windows tools that will let you see the linux partition, but booting from something like xnopix might be useful. I can't see how an upgrade would kill a partition so I am sure it is still there.
2007-12-20T18:55:00.000Z	snkmad	RatThing	well i have my ubuntu livecd here
2007-12-20T18:55:00.000Z	snkmad		i hope nothing is destroyed
2007-12-20T18:55:00.000Z	RatThing	snkmad	It would be useful to examine your grub.conf
2007-12-20T18:56:00.000Z	snkmad		its so strange, i just updated as usual, turned off the pc, and today this...
2007-12-20T18:57:00.000Z	RatThing	snkmad	I've seen lost partitions with an unexpected power outage but not in the case that you describe.
