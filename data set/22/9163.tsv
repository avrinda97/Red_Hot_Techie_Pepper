2005-05-31T08:32:00.000Z	paulproteus	shad0w1e	That's right, unless they sit down at the computer.  They could then log in.
2005-05-31T08:32:00.000Z	shad0w1e	paulproteus	so the only ways in are ftp, telnet and ssh
2005-05-31T08:33:00.000Z	paulproteus	shad0w1e	Whoa, you have telnet enabled for remote login?
2005-05-31T08:33:00.000Z	shad0w1e	paulproteus	why does everyone scream at me for that?
2005-05-31T08:33:00.000Z	paulproteus	shad0w1e	I'm not screaming; I'm mostly confused.
2005-05-31T08:35:00.000Z	paulproteus	shad0w1e	I'm saying that SSH can be used to remotely log in, so long as you have an SSH client on the other side.
2005-05-31T08:37:00.000Z	paulproteus	shad0w1e	Well, okay; anyone on that network, or anyone eavesdropping on a nearby network, can read your passwords.
2005-05-31T08:37:00.000Z	paulproteus	shad0w1e	You select text to copy.  Then you right-click to paste.
2005-05-31T08:38:00.000Z	paulproteus	shad0w1e	Anyway, we're veering off topic.  What was your original question?
2005-05-31T08:56:00.000Z	paulproteus	shad0w1e	In KDE, are they also too big when you do *not* use the NVidia driver?
2005-05-31T08:57:00.000Z	shad0w1e	paulproteus	no
2005-06-01T11:38:00.000Z	paulproteus	shad0w1e	Because you need to run 'esd'.
