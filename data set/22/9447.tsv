2004-11-09T17:47:00.000Z	steved		Forgive me if this is insanely naive, but does anyone know if there's such a thing as a gnome alarm clock?
2004-11-09T17:48:00.000Z	steved		All I can seem to find is an alarm clock plugin for XMMS
2004-11-09T17:50:00.000Z	steved		heh
2004-11-09T17:51:00.000Z	steved		Ugly, poor UI, and it's about as far from HIG-compliant as you can get :)
2004-11-09T17:51:00.000Z	steved		Wait, I guess those last 2 are the same :P
2004-11-09T17:52:00.000Z	steved		er, Hikaru79
2004-11-09T17:54:00.000Z	steved		I think I might take a stab at it. I've always wanted to write an applet.
2004-11-09T17:55:00.000Z	steved		Hrm. Tossup between C# and python.
2004-11-09T17:55:00.000Z	steved		If it could make it into the next ubuntu release with whatever stable version of mono they end up using, I'd do it in C#.
2004-11-09T17:55:00.000Z	steved		Yeah, I know. :) Python is pretty awesome.
2004-11-09T17:56:00.000Z	gruberman	steved	How's mono? Is it .NET in linux?
2004-11-09T17:56:00.000Z	steved	gruberman	It's the .NET foundation classes, ASP.net, and a C# compiler
2004-11-09T17:58:00.000Z	steved	gruberman	I would recommend getting a copy of vs.net, if you plan on writing C# on Windows with any kind of regularity.
2004-11-09T17:58:00.000Z	gruberman	steved	I wont :)
2004-11-09T06:09:00.000Z	gruberman	steved	is PyGTK something to look into?
2004-11-09T06:09:00.000Z	steved	gruberman	I would say so
2004-11-09T06:10:00.000Z	steved	gruberman	I think PyWx (or whatever) is supposed to be good, too (particularly for cross-platform code) - but I"ve never really played with wx, and I'm pretty partial to Gtk thanks to Gtk# ;)
2004-11-09T06:10:00.000Z	gruberman	steved	GTK for c#?
2004-11-09T06:11:00.000Z	steved	gruberman	Yeah, a GTK library for Mono (C#, VB.net, etc.)
2004-11-09T06:12:00.000Z	steved	gruberman	Yeah, all the widget sets are pretty annoying. Hopefully sometime in the future fd.org will help everyone standardize something beautiful :)
2004-11-09T06:13:00.000Z	gruberman	steved	So GTK is just an API for X or something? Jsut like wx is another?
2004-11-09T06:15:00.000Z	steved	gruberman	I'm sure I'm not the best person to be explaining widget toolkits, so I'll leave that to someone more knowledgable. But the only 2 you really need to worry about are GTK and Qt.
