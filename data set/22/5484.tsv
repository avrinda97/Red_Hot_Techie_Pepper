2007-07-11T10:03:00.000Z	hatter		what do i do when my feisty fawn desktop crashes ?  how do i track down error messages or something related to the crash ?
2007-07-11T10:03:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 Haven't had that happen yet.  But it's no small order.
2007-07-11T10:04:00.000Z	hatter	RickH	yes.  i am unsure where to start.  i use the desktop extensively and want to find out what to do about these crashes
2007-07-11T10:06:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 There are several.  #ubuntu-desktop is a good place to start.
2007-07-11T10:08:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 WOW!  That's odd.
2007-07-11T10:08:00.000Z	hatter	RickH	odd and painful.
2007-07-11T10:11:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 I only reboot when I need to shut down.
2007-07-11T10:11:00.000Z	hatter	RickH	is that daily ?
2007-07-11T10:11:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 I haven't had a single failure in Feisty Fawn at all.
2007-07-11T10:11:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 Yes.  The only problems I've seen are clipboard related.
2007-07-11T10:11:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 When I copy something to the clipboard from a window, then close the window, sometimes the clipboard is also cleared.
2007-07-11T10:12:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 The only other odd thing I've noticed is that inactive windows with selected text somewhere will suddenly unselect or change color if, in the active window I begin selecting text.
2007-07-11T10:13:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 I haven't had a one.  It's been the most stable OS I've used, apart from XP & Vista.
2007-07-11T10:13:00.000Z	hatter	RickH	yes, i would like to track down what is causing this.  but i have no clues
2007-07-11T10:13:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 Have you tried re-installing a fresh install to another partition?
2007-07-11T10:14:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 Then slowly adding things one at a time until something goes boom?
2007-07-11T10:25:00.000Z	hatter	RickH	no i havent done that recently,  but i did do it when fesity came out
2007-07-11T10:25:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 Done what?
2007-07-11T10:25:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 oh
2007-07-11T10:25:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 That would be the way I would track it down.
2007-07-11T10:26:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 Install separately, then add one by one.
2007-07-11T10:26:00.000Z	RickH	hatter	 Then I'd chalk it up to sunspots. :P
