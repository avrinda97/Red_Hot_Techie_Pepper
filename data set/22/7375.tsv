2006-05-01T08:12:00.000Z	Elazar		I did a default install of Ubuntu 5.1 and I'm getting this error when I try to do a JAR install of JEdit: Exception in thread "main" java.awt.AWTError: Cannot load AWT toolkit: gnu.java.awt.peer.gtk.GtkToolkit
2006-05-01T08:12:00.000Z	Elazar		Can anyone suggest how to get around it?
2006-05-01T08:14:00.000Z	NoUse	Elazar	search synaptic for gtk and java, there are gtk bindings for java you probably need to install
2006-05-01T08:24:00.000Z	Elazar	NoUse	Thanks. :)
2006-05-01T08:46:00.000Z	Elazar	NoUse	Did what you suggested and now I get this when I run the jEdit installer: ** ERROR **: file ../../../src/libjava/jni/gtk-peer/gnu_java_awt_peer_gtk_GtkImage.c: line 572 (createRawData): assertion failed: (data_fid != 0)
2006-05-01T08:47:00.000Z	NoUse	Elazar	I would talk to the Jedit people
2006-05-01T08:47:00.000Z	Elazar	NoUse	K, thanks. Don't suppose you have any suggest as to why Ubuntu sees my Creative MuVo 256 MB as a "973.8 MB Removable Volume?"
2006-05-01T08:48:00.000Z	NoUse	Elazar	well my Muve 64MB is seen as a "removable volume" but I don't know why it is messing up the size so much
2006-05-01T08:49:00.000Z	Elazar	NoUse	Hm... K, thanks.
2006-05-01T09:28:00.000Z	NoUse	Elazar	have you refreshed your sources since you've updated your repos?
2006-05-01T09:30:00.000Z	Elazar	NoUse	If you mean doing sudo apt-get update then yes.
2006-05-01T09:30:00.000Z	NoUse	Elazar	I would double check your repos and make sure multiverse isn't commented out
2006-05-01T09:41:00.000Z	Elazar	NoUse	OK, uncommented the multiverse lines, did an update (and actually got updates this time), did an upgrade, and then tried the same command again and got the same error.
2006-05-01T09:47:00.000Z	Elazar	NoUse	Uncommented multiverse lines in /etc/apt/sources.list, updated, upgraded, ran sudo apt-get install fakeroot java-package java-common, and I'm still getting E: Couldn't find package java-package.
2006-05-01T09:47:00.000Z	NoUse	Elazar	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-05-01T09:49:00.000Z	Elazar	NoUse	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12929
2006-05-01T09:50:00.000Z	NoUse	Elazar	if you do apt-cache search java-package does it show up?
2006-05-01T09:51:00.000Z	Elazar	NoUse	Command runs, but no output.
2006-05-01T09:51:00.000Z	NoUse	Elazar	pastebin the output of apt-get update
2006-05-01T09:52:00.000Z	Elazar	NoUse	thoreauputic: Took thoreauputic's suggestion and it seems to be working now. Thanks to both of you.
2006-05-01T11:16:00.000Z	NoUse	Elazar	install mplayer-fonts
2006-05-01T11:18:00.000Z	Elazar	NoUse	thoreauputic: Hm... odd how it doesn't include that as a dependency. Thanks guys. :P
