2008-01-19T14:37:00.000Z	timandtom		What do I type in place of a space in a filepath? In terminal, cd ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Knight Online tries to open ~/.wine/drive_c/Program
2008-01-19T14:39:00.000Z	astro76	timandtom	you should also be using tab completion, it will do it for you
2008-01-19T14:42:00.000Z	astro76	timandtom	yes underscore definitely doesn't work ;) it's \ before the space
2008-01-19T14:44:00.000Z	astro76	timandtom	but again tab completion helps, for example type up to Prog then hit tab, it will complete it for you with the \
2008-01-19T14:45:00.000Z	timandtom	astro76	Ah, awesome, I'll keep that in mind next time. Although, just putting it all in quotes seems easier
2008-02-07T11:30:00.000Z	astro76	timandtom	perhaps you should set your irc client to logging this time ;)
2008-02-07T11:30:00.000Z	timandtom	astro76	Actually I think it does xP I need to find the logs sometime...
2008-02-07T11:32:00.000Z	astro76	timandtom	this is also handy http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/
2008-02-07T11:33:00.000Z	timandtom	astro76	ooooh, thanks :D
2008-02-07T11:41:00.000Z	timandtom	astro76	Ah, thanks again :D Found what I was looking for in the logs. voidmage: Ok, found it, its "gconf-editor" in terminal, that opens the GUI, then its in /system/networking/wireless/networks
2008-04-26T13:32:00.000Z	timandtom	astro76	Do YOU have any idea how to install the drivers for a Broadcom Corporation BCM4401-B0 100Base-TX (rev 02)
2008-04-26T13:41:00.000Z	astro76	timandtom	the light not working is normal for the intel wirless driver... eventually it will be fixed ;)
2008-04-26T13:41:00.000Z	astro76	timandtom	although it should work in windows
2008-04-26T13:42:00.000Z	timandtom	astro76	Well, WinXP is kinda screwy on here. Hafta disable some SATA option in BIOS to get it to work, and then I can't enable it after its installed.
2008-04-26T13:43:00.000Z	timandtom	astro76	And, the light USED to work on 7.10
2008-05-01T12:19:00.000Z	astro76	timandtom	yes it will change the boot loader to grub usually, assuming you are currently running windows, you might want to have a windows cd ready you can boot to and run fdisk /mbr to restore it's bootloader should all go to pot ;)
2008-05-01T12:19:00.000Z	astro76	timandtom	and backup ;)
2008-05-01T12:21:00.000Z	timandtom	astro76	pooey :( It's just one of those Compaq Presarios that NEVER SEEM TO INCLUDE RECOVERY DISKS. So I guess thats outta the question then.
2008-05-01T12:22:00.000Z	astro76	timandtom	in the past distros would typically ask to install the bootloader to the MBR, or to the partition, so if you select the partition it won't change the windows bootloader
2008-05-01T12:22:00.000Z	astro76	timandtom	but then you need to figure out a way to boot it like a boot disk or adding to the main bootloader
2008-05-01T12:22:00.000Z	astro76	timandtom	options for trying Ubuntu without installing include the desktop cd (livecd) and wubi
2008-05-01T12:23:00.000Z	timandtom	astro76	Yeh, not really worth the hassle... I doubt anything out there would compare to Ubuntu 7.10 anyways, I was just curious what other distros were like :) And I don't like LiveCDs, too slow. Ah wells, I have enough stuff i need to do WITHOUT playin with distros, haha
