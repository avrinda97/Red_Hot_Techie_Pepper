2007-04-17T12:11:00.000Z	NemesisD		will migration-assistant allow you to pick and choose which directories to copy over when migrating from say xp to ubuntu 7.04?
2007-04-17T12:11:00.000Z	Flannel	NemesisD	#ubuntu+1 for Feisty questions
2007-06-30T09:18:00.000Z	Flannel	NemesisD	diff
2007-06-30T10:44:00.000Z	Flannel	NemesisD	ifconfig
2007-06-30T10:44:00.000Z	NemesisD	Flannel	Jordan_U thanks :)
2007-08-20T12:08:00.000Z	Flannel	NemesisD	Does it have openssh installed?
2007-08-20T12:08:00.000Z	NemesisD	Flannel	yes openssh is installed and the server is started
2007-08-20T12:09:00.000Z	Flannel	NemesisD	you're trying to connect through a router? or are they both on the same subnet?
2007-08-20T12:10:00.000Z	NemesisD	Flannel	but the router is set to forward to the ip of the machine in question
2007-08-20T12:12:00.000Z	Flannel	NemesisD	are you sure it's set to forward to the right machine?
2007-09-17T07:54:00.000Z	Flannel	NemesisD	Check out something like icecast, to stream audio
2007-09-17T07:56:00.000Z	NemesisD	Flannel	would icecast go on the serving machine or the remote one
2007-09-17T07:57:00.000Z	Flannel	NemesisD	It'd go on the server machine, and it would stream audio to any client listening.  There are a number of clients that can listen ot icecast, on all OSs
2007-09-17T07:58:00.000Z	NemesisD	Flannel	i don't suppose my favorite one exaile can though :(
2007-09-17T07:58:00.000Z	Flannel	NemesisD	What do you mean?  You're running exaile on the machine you're sitting at now?  Yeah, it can.
2007-09-17T08:00:00.000Z	NemesisD	Flannel	awesome!
2007-09-17T08:40:00.000Z	NemesisD	Flannel	so would i be able to choose files from a folder in icecast or something? I don't really see how this will work with exaile
2007-09-17T08:41:00.000Z	Flannel	NemesisD	Icecast just streams music that you give to it.  On the server, you'd run soemthing (mpd for instance) that will send music to icecast, which your local music player can listen to streaming
2007-09-17T08:42:00.000Z	NemesisD	Flannel	what controls what music is being sent to icecast though? id ideally like to be able to go through a music library like in exaile
2007-09-17T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	NemesisD	You'd use something on the server (or the machine that sends the music to the server).  mpd has an ncurses client, and a php interface, and a few other options too.
2007-11-30T06:18:00.000Z	Flannel	NemesisD	lsb_release -a
2007-11-30T06:18:00.000Z	NemesisD	Flannel	cool, thanks
