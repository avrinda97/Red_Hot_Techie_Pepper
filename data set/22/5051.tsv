2007-08-04T10:59:00.000Z	NewtoUbuntu		Hello...
2007-08-04T10:59:00.000Z	NewtoUbuntu		I seem to be unable to install GRUB
2007-08-04T10:59:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	are you running ubuntu right now?
2007-08-04T10:59:00.000Z	NewtoUbuntu	gds631	I'm using a rescue-shell yes.
2007-08-04T11:00:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	i agree w/ heroin's last
2007-08-04T11:01:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	is it the bookrecord that is the problem?
2007-08-04T11:01:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	when you boot w/o a cd, what happenes?
2007-08-04T11:08:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	have you tried remounting the disk w/ the read/write flags enables?
2007-08-04T11:12:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	i think it is mount -o remount,rw /dev/diskname /
2007-08-04T11:19:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	mount -o rw,remount / will remount it w/ read/write flags
2007-08-04T11:22:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	mount -o rw,remount /        will remount / with read/write flags
2007-08-04T11:23:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	just run mount
2007-08-04T11:24:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	it will show you the permissions for each device that is mounted
2007-08-04T11:24:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	now you should be able to install
2007-08-04T11:25:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	yes
2007-08-04T11:26:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	are you possibly using it somehewhere else?
2007-08-04T11:27:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	try "sudo killall apt-get"
2007-08-04T11:28:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	and then try the apt-get install again
2007-08-04T11:29:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	have you actually installed ubuntu yet?
2007-08-04T11:29:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	if not, then i would suggest trying the cd installer again, but first running the mount -o rw,remount / and then trying the install on the disk
2007-08-04T11:30:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	when i say "the install" i'm referring to the icon on the desktop that says "install"
2007-08-04T11:30:00.000Z	gds631	NewtoUbuntu	is what bad?
