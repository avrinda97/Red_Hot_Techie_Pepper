2009-01-16T01:48:00.000Z	noobem		hello all. quick question: tar.gz packages, where are they supposed to be installed? /usr/somehwere, /opt/..?
2009-01-16T01:49:00.000Z	noobem		also, second question: how do i sudo in the filemanager?
2009-01-16T01:50:00.000Z	jrib	noobem	you shouldn't need to
2009-01-16T01:50:00.000Z	noobem	jrib	?
2009-01-16T01:50:00.000Z	jrib	noobem	you shouldn't need to sudo the file manager
2009-01-16T01:51:00.000Z	noobem	jrib	when i try to copy files to /opt it says access denied
2009-01-16T01:51:00.000Z	jrib	noobem	what are you copying there?
2009-01-16T01:51:00.000Z	noobem	jrib	eclipse
2009-01-16T01:52:00.000Z	jrib	noobem	eclipse is in the repositories.  Do you know about synaptic?
2009-01-16T01:52:00.000Z	noobem	jrib	i'm used to win. dunno where to put packages like that. /opt not the place?
2009-01-16T01:53:00.000Z	jrib	noobem	you don't install software by manually downloading stuff (or at least you try to avoid it whenever possible).  Instead you use the repositories with the help of programs like System -> Administration -> Synaptic
2009-01-16T01:53:00.000Z	noobem	jrib	found only vanilla eclipse in synaptic. wanted to install the eclipse j2ee package
2009-01-16T01:53:00.000Z	jrib	noobem	ok, well 'gksudo nautilus' then
2009-01-16T01:53:00.000Z	noobem	jrib	yeah. i'm familiar with the concept. thoung not everything is available in synaptic
2009-01-16T01:54:00.000Z	noobem	jrib	needs to be launched from terminal you mean?
2009-01-16T01:54:00.000Z	jrib	noobem	or press alt-f2 and type it there, yeah
2009-01-16T01:54:00.000Z	noobem	jrib	brilliant! Cheers!
2009-01-16T01:55:00.000Z	jrib	noobem	sudo aptitude purge #
2009-01-16T01:55:00.000Z	jrib	noobem	erm, sorry, ignore that
2009-01-16T01:56:00.000Z	noobem	jrib	the eclipse j2ee package
2009-01-16T01:56:00.000Z	jrib	noobem	hmm?
2009-01-16T01:57:00.000Z	noobem	jrib	ops. sorry. read scrollback question :)
