2009-01-26T09:10:00.000Z	srid	Ahadiel	checkinstall won't install dependent package sources
2009-01-26T09:10:00.000Z	Ahadiel	srid	Oh yeah, that's right.
2009-01-26T09:10:00.000Z	Ahadiel	srid	apt-get build-dep packagename?
2009-01-26T09:11:00.000Z	Ahadiel	srid	^
2009-01-26T09:13:00.000Z	Ahadiel	srid	If you want a somewhat source-friendly distro try Archlinux
2009-01-26T09:13:00.000Z	Ahadiel	srid	No, apt-get build-dep grabs the dependencies for the specified package.
2009-01-26T09:14:00.000Z	srid	Ahadiel	I was looking at archlinux before, but sadly the ubuntu live cd does not allow me to burn any ISO :(
2009-01-26T09:14:00.000Z	Ahadiel	srid	I think you can copy it to ram
2009-01-26T09:14:00.000Z	srid	Ahadiel	how so?
2009-01-26T09:14:00.000Z	Ahadiel	srid	I'll look it up right now
2009-01-26T09:15:00.000Z	srid	Ahadiel	i tried boot options.. but there isn't way to make it load in ram
2009-01-26T09:17:00.000Z	Ahadiel	srid	hrm, seems to requrie alot of work https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BootToRAM
2009-01-26T09:17:00.000Z	Ahadiel	srid	I know in other distros you could just append "toram" or "copy2ram" to the boot line.
2009-01-26T09:17:00.000Z	srid	Ahadiel	I vaguely remember doing that in knoppix once upon a time
2009-01-26T09:18:00.000Z	Ahadiel	srid	If you have a spare USB stick ( > 512 ) you can put the arch installer on it
2009-01-26T09:18:00.000Z	srid	Ahadiel	anyway, I'm almost done with installing ubuntu on my HD (after screwing up the freebsd installation). I will install sawfish and keep a minimal interface
2009-01-26T09:18:00.000Z	Ahadiel	srid	k
2009-01-26T09:18:00.000Z	srid	Ahadiel	I tried that too (put arch img in 8gb usb stick.. but grub failed with error 17)
2009-01-26T09:19:00.000Z	Ahadiel	srid	Strange.
2009-01-26T09:19:00.000Z	Ahadiel	srid	How did you copy the img over? dd?
2009-01-26T09:19:00.000Z	srid	Ahadiel	yes. dd if=arch.img of=/dev/...
