2008-06-22T03:06:00.000Z	Elijah		how do i pull the current settings for my network card
2008-06-22T03:07:00.000Z	vocx	Elijah	maybe "iwconfig" or "ifconfig" in the terminal
2008-06-22T03:17:00.000Z	vocx	Elijah	it's just the graphical interface
2008-06-22T03:46:00.000Z	Elijah	vocx	The cube works but jut not when a window is open
2008-06-22T03:47:00.000Z	vocx	Elijah	never used compiz, sorry
2008-06-22T03:58:00.000Z	vocx	Elijah	setup a terminal to open at startup, so next time you log in it is already open. There you are  hax0r.
2008-06-22T04:01:00.000Z	vocx	Elijah	the shortcut soundray gave you does not open a new terminal it was an example. You can setup your own shortcuts too
2008-06-22T04:06:00.000Z	vocx	Elijah	but you can also set up a gnome-terminal from the beginning as I told you. But apparently you prefer to waste time by clicking with your mouse.
2008-06-22T04:06:00.000Z	Elijah	vocx	i would not like a terminal open all the time
2008-06-22T04:07:00.000Z	vocx	Elijah	don't be afraid, you will look more leet in front of your friends, and chicks
2008-06-22T04:08:00.000Z	Elijah	vocx	i guess a true linux user uses terminal for everything so maybe i will set to run at startup, i will definitely keep that in my head
2008-06-22T04:08:00.000Z	vocx	Elijah	if you really want to remove a kernel you remove it's package like linux-image-2.6.20 or whatever, but you may do as IndyGunFreak says too.
2008-06-22T04:09:00.000Z	Elijah	vocx	yes i do some sort of search for '~linux-image~i' but forgot what the beginning is
2008-06-22T04:09:00.000Z	vocx	Elijah	aptitude search 'linux-image'
2008-06-22T04:13:00.000Z	vocx	Elijah	it maybe listing the previous kernels, and there is actually a lot of kernels so it shouldn't surprise you.
2008-06-22T04:14:00.000Z	vocx	Elijah	why to you use the strange tilde thingies ~ ?
2008-06-22T04:14:00.000Z	Elijah	vocx	the user before showed me them and they worked great
2008-06-22T04:15:00.000Z	vocx	Elijah	well you don't need them, just use a full word, like 'linux-image'  or with spaces for multiple terms like 'linux kernel image 64'
2008-06-22T04:28:00.000Z	Elijah	vocx	so i cannot just remove the old kernel without downloading 20 MB
2008-06-22T04:28:00.000Z	vocx	Elijah	there was a recent kernel update
2008-06-22T04:29:00.000Z	vocx	Elijah	yes probably you can, but well, usually you would want to update anyway.
2008-06-22T04:30:00.000Z	vocx	Elijah	you are in what dial-up?
