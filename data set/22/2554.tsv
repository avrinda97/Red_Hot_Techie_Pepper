2011-01-07T04:29:00.000Z	kaddi_	shcherbak	i have as full an image as I can get with ddrescue..
2011-01-07T04:31:00.000Z	shcherbak	kaddi_	ls /bin/ /usr/bin/ /sbin/ or ls -lR /* | grep -rwx
2011-01-07T04:31:00.000Z	shcherbak	kaddi_	*/usr/sbin/*
2011-01-07T04:46:00.000Z	shcherbak	kaddi_	what do you do? try to use ls to gather info of failed system, also copy logs.
2011-01-07T04:48:00.000Z	kaddi_	shcherbak	hard drive died, I did a complete image of the drive with dd_rescue. I have reinstalled on a new hard drive from which I'm currently running. I would like to have the new system the way the old one was. I have copied back my user account data and now would like to gather from that image, somehow the list of installed packages as to install the same packages onto the new installation.
2011-01-07T04:49:00.000Z	kaddi_	shcherbak	I used the opportunity to also change partition sizes and reinstall the windows which is why I did not just play back the image, besides there's a lot of holes in it so I'm not sure I would have gotten a working system anyways
2011-01-07T04:55:00.000Z	shcherbak	kaddi_	silly me, you there?
2011-01-07T04:55:00.000Z	kaddi_	shcherbak	yes
2011-01-07T04:56:00.000Z	kaddi_	shcherbak	still reading man chroot and trying on deciding whether it's realy worth it.. :p
2011-01-07T04:56:00.000Z	shcherbak	kaddi_	you want to have list of programs, right?
2011-01-07T04:56:00.000Z	kaddi_	shcherbak	yeah, or packages
2011-01-07T04:56:00.000Z	shcherbak	kaddi_	man is answear!
2011-01-07T04:59:00.000Z	shcherbak	kaddi_	/usr/share/doc/ most of programs write there
2011-01-07T05:00:00.000Z	kaddi_	shcherbak	are those names identical to the ones of the packages? or would I have to match them to the package in question?
2011-01-07T05:04:00.000Z	shcherbak	kaddi_	and this /var/lib/dpkg/status
2011-01-07T05:05:00.000Z	shcherbak	kaddi_	scroll down to ready script http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1356841
2011-01-07T05:07:00.000Z	kaddi_	shcherbak	awesome! Thanks! :)
2011-01-07T05:08:00.000Z	shcherbak	kaddi_	Now I will spend some time to getting more familiar with apt, such incompetence of mine.
2011-01-07T05:10:00.000Z	kaddi_	shcherbak	I think I'll have to do the chroot thing too, just to know what happens once you do it.. :) Thanks for the many alternatives though :)
2011-01-07T05:32:00.000Z	kaddi_	shcherbak	could I take up your time one more time? I'm going through the chroot steps now, just so I've done it once. And everything works fine until I try to write the output to a file. Then it tells me it's a read-only file system and stops. Do you have an idea what the issue might be?
2011-01-07T05:40:00.000Z	kaddi_	shcherbak	nvm, looks like i've managed to locate the bad sectors and that's what was causing the issues
