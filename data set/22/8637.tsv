2006-04-25T08:27:00.000Z	KrakensDen		I've had two hard X crashes in two days [IE, couldn't switch to another virtual console] 
2006-04-25T08:27:00.000Z	KrakensDen		are there any logfiles I can check?
2006-04-25T08:28:00.000Z	amphi	KrakensDen	what card?
2006-04-25T08:28:00.000Z	KrakensDen	amphi	i810
2006-04-25T08:28:00.000Z	KrakensDen	amphi	well, i825
2006-04-25T08:28:00.000Z	KrakensDen	amphi	but IIRC it uses the i810 driver
2006-04-25T08:28:00.000Z	amphi	KrakensDen	dunno about that one - does the man page for the driver have any info?
2006-04-25T08:29:00.000Z	KrakensDen	amphi	didn't check it. Whups
2006-04-25T08:29:00.000Z	KrakensDen	amphi	has nothing about logging
2006-04-25T08:29:00.000Z	amphi	KrakensDen	it may say nothing useful - I had an old s3 card and x hung a lot, and the man page said it was a known issue and had a workaround
2006-04-25T08:34:00.000Z	KrakensDen	amphi	any ideas where crash information might get logged?
2006-04-25T08:35:00.000Z	amphi	KrakensDen	/var/log/Xorg.0.log but I doubt you'll see anything useful if it hung
2006-04-25T08:35:00.000Z	KrakensDen	amphi	yeah, there's nothing useful there
2006-04-25T09:17:00.000Z	amphi	KrakensDen	not necessarily
2006-04-25T09:18:00.000Z	KrakensDen	amphi	I just googled his modem
2006-04-25T09:18:00.000Z	KrakensDen	amphi	it's a cable modem
2006-04-25T09:21:00.000Z	KrakensDen	amphi	http://linux-usb.sourceforge.net/SpeedTouch/ubuntu/index.html
2006-04-25T09:22:00.000Z	amphi	KrakensDen	it's a speedtouch he's talking about?
2006-04-25T09:22:00.000Z	amphi	KrakensDen	I've only used pppoatm with those
2006-04-25T09:23:00.000Z	KrakensDen	amphi	according to an ubuntu forum post, they may be equivalent
2006-04-25T09:23:00.000Z	KrakensDen	amphi	not much of a source though
2006-04-25T09:23:00.000Z	amphi	KrakensDen	he's talking about a cable modem connected via ethernet
