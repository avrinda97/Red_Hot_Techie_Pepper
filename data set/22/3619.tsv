2008-08-09T00:21:00.000Z	RoshanK	integral_	did u install over the partitions for windows? it might be that you cant see b/c of the MBR being changed
2008-08-09T00:23:00.000Z	RoshanK	integral_	try this http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/reinstall-ubuntu-grub-bootloader-after-windows-wipes-it-out/
2008-08-09T00:24:00.000Z	RoshanK	integral_	gparted didn't boot or what?
2008-08-09T00:25:00.000Z	RoshanK	integral_	but when it analyzed the drive did u still see the ubuntu partition still being there?
2008-08-09T00:26:00.000Z	RoshanK	integral_	so u currently have windows running on that machine?
2008-08-09T00:28:00.000Z	RoshanK	integral_	sure, also i recommend that u back up ur data immediately
2008-08-09T00:29:00.000Z	RoshanK	integral_	its possible that the partition is still on there unless windows wrote over the whole drive itself
2008-08-09T00:35:00.000Z	RoshanK	integral_	sorry im really not much of an expert on this. i recommend u ceck out super grub disk though, and see if it does anything, but since u said that you deleted the other partitions, its possible that u cant use them anymore. now ud probably have to remake new partitions
2008-08-09T00:37:00.000Z	RoshanK	integral_	please use pastebin
2008-08-09T00:44:00.000Z	RoshanK	integral_	windows sucks at detecting partitions and other operating systems i installed xp after vista and something horrible happened as well
2008-08-09T00:44:00.000Z	integral_	RoshanK	usually we have to install previous versions first
2008-08-09T00:45:00.000Z	RoshanK	integral_	exactly, and windows is like a previous version and its ignorant about other OSes
2008-08-09T00:47:00.000Z	RoshanK	integral_	i think that if u back up your /home u can keep settings, but you may have to reinstall both thanks to bill gates.
2008-08-09T00:47:00.000Z	integral_	RoshanK	even with GHOST image?
2008-08-09T00:48:00.000Z	RoshanK	integral_	i dont know much about GHOST so i guess u should ask someone else, sorry
