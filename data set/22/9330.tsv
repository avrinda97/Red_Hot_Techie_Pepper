2004-12-14T12:24:00.000Z	thenuke		I am really getting enough of this localisation :D badblocks --help gives me help in swedish :D When my chosen language is finnish
2004-12-14T12:24:00.000Z	thenuke		any other commands give their helps in english :)
2004-12-14T12:25:00.000Z	thenuke		how do I change the whole god damn language to english =)
2004-12-14T12:25:00.000Z	thenuke		thanks :)
2004-12-14T12:25:00.000Z	thenuke		I hope that this will become better in the future ;)
2004-12-14T12:25:00.000Z	thenuke		aah :) I'll try just to fallback to english
2004-12-14T12:26:00.000Z	thenuke		I dont understand why.. oh it's a bug :)
2004-12-14T12:27:00.000Z	thenuke		can I activate root-account with passwd alone?
2004-12-14T12:27:00.000Z	sladen	thenuke	sudo passwd
2004-12-14T12:27:00.000Z	sladen	thenuke	I don't recommend it, but that choice is in your hands if you want to
2004-12-14T12:38:00.000Z	sladen	thenuke	presubmly change the '60' to '75' or something
2004-12-14T12:38:00.000Z	thenuke	sladen	well how :) xrandr wont do that because it says that 60 is max
2004-12-14T12:55:00.000Z	sladen	thenuke	same as any Linux kernel, it's all cacheing and shared pages
2004-12-14T12:56:00.000Z	sladen	thenuke	nope point wasted unused memory if you can use it to cache other files on disk
2004-12-14T12:56:00.000Z	thenuke	sladen	hum, any ways to make it not to cache everything :) And is that wise anyways :) ?
2004-12-14T12:57:00.000Z	sladen	thenuke	if it needs the RAM to run programs, it'll use it.  It's not you're job to do memory-management for the linux kernel!
2004-12-14T12:57:00.000Z	thenuke	sladen	:) I'm doing badblocks check, and it would be faster if I could offer it more memory to use I guess
2004-12-14T12:58:00.000Z	sladen	thenuke	no it wouldn't.  Hard-disks are slow devices, (10,000+ times slower than RAM).  A badblocks test to reading and writing to every sector on the harddisks
2004-12-14T12:59:00.000Z	thenuke	sladen	I stand corrected
2004-12-14T13:00:00.000Z	sladen	thenuke	dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/hdb bs=1M
2004-12-14T13:01:00.000Z	thenuke	sladen	what is that blocksize for? just to make it faster or something?
2004-12-14T13:02:00.000Z	sladen	thenuke	yeah, just a speed thing.  It's worth trying to find the sweet spot with a few tests between 32k and 1M
