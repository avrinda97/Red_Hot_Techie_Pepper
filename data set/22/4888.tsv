2007-10-29T19:46:00.000Z	peepsalot	vegananarchist	try /media/cdrom
2007-10-29T19:46:00.000Z	peepsalot	vegananarchist	or create some new directory for it yourself.   cd /media; sudo mkdir newDirectoryName
2007-10-29T19:47:00.000Z	peepsalot	vegananarchist	removable drives usually get mounted somewhere under /media in Ubuntu.  doesn't really matter where you put them, but that's the convention
2007-10-29T19:49:00.000Z	peepsalot	vegananarchist	man mount
2007-10-29T19:49:00.000Z	vegananarchist	peepsalot	what?
2007-10-29T19:50:00.000Z	peepsalot	vegananarchist	then you read
2007-10-29T19:52:00.000Z	vegananarchist	peepsalot	i'm trying to save a paper and i don't have much time, can i get a hint?
2007-10-29T19:52:00.000Z	peepsalot	vegananarchist	honestly i don't have the mount command syntax memorized, i'd have to read the man pages, in which case it's probably more efficient for you to read them yourself
2007-10-29T19:53:00.000Z	vegananarchist	peepsalot	ok thanks, if i have any more questions i will ask
2007-10-29T20:00:00.000Z	peepsalot	vegananarchist	cat /etc/fstab
2007-10-29T20:00:00.000Z	peepsalot	vegananarchist	or sudo gedit /etc/fstab
2007-10-29T20:00:00.000Z	peepsalot	vegananarchist	make a backup if you are going to edit it
