2007-09-07T08:25:00.000Z	MrKeuner		why shoul/should not be afraid of third party debian packages?
2007-09-07T08:25:00.000Z	ikonia	MrKeuner	debian is not ubuntu
2007-09-07T08:25:00.000Z	MrKeuner	ikonia	deb packages I tried to mean
2007-09-07T08:26:00.000Z	ikonia	MrKeuner	they can potentially do damage or require dependencies that your system doesn't have or update your system with newer incompatible versions
2007-09-07T08:27:00.000Z	MrKeuner	ikonia	can deb file erase a file /etc/testfile or write over it?
2007-09-07T08:27:00.000Z	ikonia	MrKeuner	deb file can do anything - it executed with root permissinos
2008-04-24T21:01:00.000Z	ikonia	MrKeuner	poit the repo at the cdrom and use the dist-upgrade option
2008-04-24T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	MrKeuner	my personal preference is a clean install if possible
2008-04-24T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	MrKeuner	more so when moving from non-lts to lts
2008-04-24T21:20:00.000Z	MrKeuner	ikonia	I am considering if there will be problem with new drivers if they fail to initialize since there are older versions
2008-04-24T21:37:00.000Z	MrKeuner	ikonia	what is different in non-lts than lts with respect to upgrading from each to other?
2009-04-27T00:39:00.000Z	ikonia	MrKeuner	no-one cares if you'll buy ati or not again - stop complaining about it
2009-04-27T00:39:00.000Z	MrKeuner	ikonia	yeah i'm looking for the channel
2009-04-27T00:40:00.000Z	ikonia	MrKeuner	there isn't one - get a grip please
2012-02-03T14:10:00.000Z	MrKeuner	ikonia	updating DNS record for the WAN
2012-02-03T14:11:00.000Z	ikonia	MrKeuner	most dhcp servers will update the dns records when they assign it
2012-02-03T14:13:00.000Z	ikonia	MrKeuner	well you won't get a performance boost from any message, the dns's servers expire time, cache time will be the deciding factor
2012-02-03T14:14:00.000Z	MrKeuner	ikonia	right, but I'd like to do the best I can
2012-02-03T14:15:00.000Z	ikonia	MrKeuner	as I've said there isn't a "best you can" method, do what ever works for you, however the response will depend on the dns server
2012-02-03T14:16:00.000Z	MrKeuner	ikonia	assume that ttl 60 seconds and the dns server honor that value than there is better i can do in terms of notifying my authoritative dns
2012-02-03T14:17:00.000Z	ikonia	MrKeuner	not really, and no public dns server would have that value as it would be blacklisted
2012-02-03T14:17:00.000Z	MrKeuner	ikonia	dyndns subdomains have 60 seconds ttl
