2008-02-09T11:26:00.000Z	roddersg		anyone have problems with WINE frezine
2008-02-09T11:26:00.000Z	roddersg		anglel, you must look for the /etc/fstab,  missing first "/"
2008-02-09T11:27:00.000Z	roddersg		angel - your second line /dev/ for the floppy is wrong
2008-02-09T11:28:00.000Z	roddersg		that's the cause of your error
2008-02-09T11:28:00.000Z	roddersg		you might need to use sudo vi /etc/fstab
2008-02-09T11:28:00.000Z	roddersg		yes you do
2008-02-09T11:29:00.000Z	roddersg		after that, try mounting your cdrom again
2008-02-09T11:30:00.000Z	roddersg		anyone know the command to restore the .Desktop folder?
2008-02-09T11:31:00.000Z	roddersg		Flannel correct, just modified xserver.xorg and need to restore it
2008-02-09T11:32:00.000Z	roddersg		angel - you have to be root to edit the fstab
2008-02-09T11:32:00.000Z	Genius16	roddersg	yeah. for cereals
2008-02-09T11:42:00.000Z	roddersg	Genius16	- how about WINE?  Its freezing when i try to access the filesystem
2008-02-09T11:43:00.000Z	Genius16	roddersg	 how are you accessing the filesystem? which filesystem exactly?
2008-02-09T11:44:00.000Z	roddersg	Genius16	- normal WINE installation, progs work etc.  but when I do a file open, wine freezes
2008-02-09T11:44:00.000Z	Genius16	roddersg	like you're running notepad and you go "file---open" and BLAM! your poo gets sexed?
2008-02-09T11:46:00.000Z	Genius16	roddersg	i dont know why it'd be a display driver. have you ran "notepad" in console and crashed it to get what errors wine is giving? thats the easy way
2008-02-09T11:47:00.000Z	roddersg	Genius16	Ok, just opened notepad, just opend a file and it freezed, no messages on the terminal window
2008-02-09T11:47:00.000Z	roddersg	Genius16	After a whle it says "Open" not responding
2008-02-09T11:48:00.000Z	roddersg	Genius16	can type in stuff and save the file though
2008-02-09T11:48:00.000Z	Genius16	roddersg	and you ran notepad by running int he terminal "wine /home/#USERNAME/.wine/drive_c/windows/notepad.exe"
2008-02-09T11:49:00.000Z	Genius16	roddersg	well er that works too. that whole "wine notepad"
2008-02-09T11:49:00.000Z	Genius16	roddersg	didnt want you to be running notepad and opening a terminal.
