2007-02-08T10:04:00.000Z	vox754	pesb10	I'm sure there is a way to create another partition, so you can copy your files.
2007-02-08T10:04:00.000Z	vox754	pesb10	you need to provide specific information like the output from "/etc/fstab" and "sudo fdsik -l"
2007-02-08T10:08:00.000Z	pesb10	vox754	sorry, i'm not good with linux...can you explain more?
2007-02-08T10:09:00.000Z	pesb10	vox754	i wan to reinstall my linux without formating ...is it possible?
2007-02-08T10:10:00.000Z	vox754	pesb10	not really, but you don't have to loose your data. You can always keep your data safe.
2007-02-08T10:11:00.000Z	pesb10	vox754	ic...but my hdd is only 1 partition...and i cant access into linux...can i copy my data into another hdd?
2007-02-08T10:12:00.000Z	vox754	pesb10	you bet, you can. You can run a Live CD Linux, then copy your info to another disk. Kill your old disk, reinstall and you copy back your data.
2007-02-08T10:12:00.000Z	pesb10	vox754	, ic...thanks alot...but erm can you teach me the process?
2007-02-08T10:14:00.000Z	vox754	pesb10	I can guide you step-by-step right now. You really need to give information about your disk, partitions, operating system, file systems,...
2007-02-08T10:15:00.000Z	pesb10		vox754...ok thanks...wat info you need?
2007-02-08T10:16:00.000Z	vox754	pesb10	"I CANNOT" guide you right now. I made a mistake in the previous post.
2007-02-08T10:17:00.000Z	pesb10		vox754....erm...aiks...ok...its ok..thanks alot
2007-02-08T10:17:00.000Z	pesb10		vox : i'll try to troubleshoot around
2007-02-08T10:17:00.000Z	vox754	pesb10	I'm terribly sorry. I missed the NOT.
2007-02-08T10:20:00.000Z	vox754	pesb10	keep asking here, it's not really that hard.  Or you may have better luck on weekends.
