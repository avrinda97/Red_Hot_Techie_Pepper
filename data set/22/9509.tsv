2004-10-17T12:15:00.000Z	calc		it was a trade secret which is no longer
2004-10-17T12:16:00.000Z	ranman	calc	i found a thread in german talking about this problem.. seems he updated his bios and it went away...
2004-10-17T12:28:00.000Z	ranman	calc	http://prism54.org/supported_cards.php
2004-10-17T12:29:00.000Z	calc	ranman	i meant for the prism1/2/2.5/3 chips
2004-10-17T12:31:00.000Z	calc	ranman	yea for usb
2004-10-17T12:36:00.000Z	calc	ranman	yea it appears ubuntu uses 2.6 and that 2.6 doesn't have the prism 1/2/2.5 drivers and linux-wlan-ng is only avail for 2.4
2004-10-17T12:50:00.000Z	calc	ranman	does gpm even come with ubuntu?
2004-10-17T12:51:00.000Z	calc	ranman	er what?
2004-10-17T12:51:00.000Z	calc	ranman	he is talking about touchpad not working in gnome, no need for gpm for that
2004-10-17T12:59:00.000Z	calc	ranman	he loaded psmouse and restarted xfree (via c-a-b) and it still didn't see it :\
2004-10-19T09:20:00.000Z	calc	ranman	er there is no /var/lib/menu, it appears /etc/menu is the global location
2004-10-19T09:29:00.000Z	ranman	calc	phin: oops, I was wrong about the location... "/usr/lib/menu" take a look at the package menu.. "dpkg -L menu"
2004-10-19T09:30:00.000Z	calc	ranman	/usr/lib/menu isn't the dir that the admin normally modifies, its the dist install location
2004-10-19T09:32:00.000Z	ranman	calc	I agree, he was looking for "permenant"
2004-10-19T11:50:00.000Z	calc	ranman	NLD comes out RSN, maybe end of this month even
2004-10-19T13:21:00.000Z	calc	ranman	ide-scsi is no longer used
