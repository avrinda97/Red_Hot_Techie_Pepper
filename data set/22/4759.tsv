2011-11-28T18:07:00.000Z	zagibu		hibernation is very hardware-dependant, so no general answer is possible
2011-11-28T18:08:00.000Z	user1	zagibu	come on . dont blame hardware and when windows is/are/whatever doing it fine
2011-11-28T18:09:00.000Z	zagibu		i don't blame anyone
2011-11-28T18:10:00.000Z	user1		dr_wiilis: i cant understand when version prior to 11.04 can hibernate why cant these?
2011-11-28T18:10:00.000Z	zagibu	user1	are you still in the "linux is a free windows" phase?
2011-11-28T18:11:00.000Z	user1	zagibu	i am in "linux is windows is not needed " phase
2011-11-28T18:11:00.000Z	zagibu		whatever that means
2011-11-28T18:11:00.000Z	user1		yeah nowadays ubuntu has lot of "whatever" guys. they have become kind of lethargic
2011-11-28T18:12:00.000Z	zagibu	user1	yeah, you seem to be one of them...why not write some code and fix your hibernation problem yourself instead of waiting for "them" to fix it?
2011-11-28T18:13:00.000Z	user1	zagibu	: :-) yes i am the most lethargic. just kindling there
2011-11-28T18:13:00.000Z	user1	zagibu	lots of porn you know. no time.
2011-11-28T18:14:00.000Z	zagibu		don't worry, it will get better with age
2011-11-28T18:15:00.000Z	zagibu		well, it won't, your time will be eaten away by other things
2011-11-28T18:17:00.000Z	user1	zagibu	its also because females getting into that we getting into coding. its becoming complementing each other with most coders into that
2011-11-28T18:17:00.000Z	zagibu	user1	not sure I want to understand what you're talking about, but it sounds kinky
2011-11-28T18:18:00.000Z	user1	zagibu	i can see your browser cache. hmmm quite kinky you as well ;)
2011-11-28T18:19:00.000Z	zagibu	user1	so jenkins build logs turn you on? to each his own, I guess
2011-11-28T18:20:00.000Z	user1	zagibu	so you mean you are clean as crystal
2011-11-28T18:20:00.000Z	zagibu	user1	i'm on a business computer, and I actually don't want to lose my job, it pays quite well
2011-11-28T18:21:00.000Z	zagibu	user1	btw, this is quite offtopic...I suggest personal messages if you want to continue
2011-11-28T18:23:00.000Z	user1	zagibu	nothing personal unless you want to continue. just want to know if i can just upgrade only my kernel. it takes 1.04 GB to dist upgrade11 is that really required?
2011-11-28T18:29:00.000Z	zagibu	user1	if you don't have the desired kernel in your packages, you either have to adjust the package sources, or get and install it manually
