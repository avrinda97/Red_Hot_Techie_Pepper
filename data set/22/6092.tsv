2006-12-23T13:34:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	They are both the same, essentially.
2006-12-23T13:34:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	What games are they, specifically.
2006-12-23T13:35:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	The first thing you should do is search for their names in synaptic. If they are there, install them that way instead.
2006-12-23T13:35:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	Otherwise, the sources that you have are not easy to install.
2006-12-23T13:37:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	You will want to start Synaptic from System/Administration
2006-12-23T13:38:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	Use synaptic, not apt-get.
2006-12-23T13:39:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	Click on search
2006-12-23T13:40:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	You will probably need to enable universe though to have any wide selection. You can do so by going to Settings->Repositories.
2006-12-23T13:43:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	Click on Community maintained ... and Software restricted by ...
2006-12-23T13:43:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	Assuming they are already selected.
2006-12-23T13:43:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	Hmm... probably since I'm running Feisty instead of Edgy or Dapper.
2006-12-23T13:44:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	You should read help.ubuntu.com.
2006-12-23T13:45:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	ah.
2006-12-23T13:45:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	one minute
2006-12-23T13:46:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	https://help.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/extra-repositories.html has the instruction you want.
2006-12-23T13:47:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	Keep in mind while reading such things that if something is described as illegal in some countries, it is probably illegal in the US, it is highly unlikely that anyone will be prosecuted for it, and it is probably something you want.
2006-12-23T13:52:00.000Z	DeagsDoesLinux	cge	, now that i have enabled the universe thing i am good to go on searching for the games i have correct?
2006-12-23T13:52:00.000Z	cge	DeagsDoesLinux	yes
