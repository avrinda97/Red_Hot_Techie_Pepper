2010-03-27T08:02:00.000Z	Purpley		When i type in symlink in terminal it says it isnt a command
2010-03-27T08:02:00.000Z	Purpley		Isnt it?
2010-03-27T08:02:00.000Z	Purpley		Because then when i say man symlink it appears to be a valid command
2010-03-27T08:04:00.000Z	Purpley		Ahhh there we go
2010-03-27T08:04:00.000Z	Purpley		thanks
2010-03-27T08:05:00.000Z	Purpley		Where are the libaries typically stored?
2010-03-27T08:05:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	Purpley	/usr/lib and /lib
2010-03-27T08:06:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	Purpley	if you have a 64bit install youll have lib32 and lib64 folders, the lib folder is a system link to lib64
2010-03-27T08:10:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	Purpley	use this "ln -s <item u want to link> <where you want to link it>
2010-03-27T08:11:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	Purpley	?
2010-03-27T08:12:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	Purpley	otherway around
2010-03-27T08:14:00.000Z	Purpley	WhiteDawn	And do I have to supply the full directory to where the actual libary is? and where would I point the file its asking for?
2010-03-27T08:15:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	Purpley	you want the full directory, and i allways put 64bit libs in /usr/lib64 while 32bit libs in /usr/lib32, if your in a 32bit system just put it in /usr/lib
2010-03-27T08:15:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	Purpley	you will also need to run as root, so put sudo befor that
2010-03-27T08:15:00.000Z	Purpley	WhiteDawn	I have a 64 bit system but im not sure if I actually use 64 bit is there a way to check quickly?
2010-03-27T08:18:00.000Z	Purpley	WhiteDawn	I have a 64 bit system but im not sure if I actually use 64 bit is there a way to check quickly?
2010-03-27T08:18:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	Purpley	look in your filesystem for a /usr/lib64
2010-03-27T08:20:00.000Z	Purpley	WhiteDawn	Yup I have it
2010-03-27T08:21:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	Purpley	then you have a 64bit os installed
2010-03-27T08:36:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	Purpley	sudo rm <path to syslink>
2010-03-27T08:44:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	Purpley	search ubuntu package repo on the website, you can download and install packges from older distros, possibly ur libstd will be there
2010-03-27T08:45:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	Purpley	I've had to do it myself for a older propietary program. You can also try and modify the make file, but that could cause issues with version differences
