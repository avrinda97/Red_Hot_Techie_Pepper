2007-05-30T08:33:00.000Z	malkir		My xserver is giving me blue screen error, and can't detect my video card
2007-05-30T08:34:00.000Z	malkir		Except I know my video card is supported, I just can't find what the PCI-Express slot is names
2007-05-30T08:34:00.000Z	malkir		(WW) ATI: PCI in slot 1:0:0 could not be detected!
2007-05-30T08:34:00.000Z	malkir		(WW) ATI: PCI in slot 1:0:1 could not be detected!
2007-05-30T08:34:00.000Z	malkir		I've updated to latest ubuntu, latest xserver
2007-05-30T08:35:00.000Z	malkir		did it
2007-05-30T08:35:00.000Z	malkir		It knows the name of my card, etc
2007-05-30T08:35:00.000Z	malkir		but when I lspci | grep PCI
2007-05-30T08:35:00.000Z	malkir		Reboot with previous kernel = normal reboot?
2007-05-30T08:37:00.000Z	malkir		Sigh, can we get a less cluttered room for quicky advice :)
2007-05-30T08:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	malkir	Yes, #ubuntu-classroom
2007-05-30T08:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	malkir	Exept for the faster advice part... usually you have to wait a while *because* there are fewer people
2007-05-30T08:39:00.000Z	malkir	Jordan_U	thanks :)
2007-05-30T08:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	malkir	What kind of GFX card?
2007-05-30T08:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	malkir	You can install fglrx from the liveCD to get to the GUI, or install using the alternate CD then install fglrx
2007-05-30T09:00:00.000Z	malkir	Jordan_U	So I can pop in my alternate CD and find gflrx? Happen to know where its located?
2007-05-30T09:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	malkir	No, it is not on the alternate CD, you have to install it from the repos
2007-05-30T09:01:00.000Z	malkir	Jordan_U	Repos? I'm not familiar. I have 3 disks - an old Ubunu Install/Live combination, and the most recent 'alternate' and i just threw the alternate image on a cd a minute ago
2007-05-30T09:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	malkir	The repositories ( repos ) are the online source for installing applications ( where apt-get / synaptic grabs them from )
2007-05-30T09:03:00.000Z	malkir	Jordan_U	I've run apt-get update and distro-upgrade
2007-05-30T09:05:00.000Z	malkir	Jordan_U	I have the crashlog at http://www.uberdan.com/hack/Xorg.0.log
2007-05-30T09:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	malkir	"fglrx" You need to enable universe then install "xorg-driver-fglrx" then run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh" and choose "fglrx" as the driver
