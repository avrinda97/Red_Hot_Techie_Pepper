2007-12-02T22:14:00.000Z	mikebeecham		hey guys...can I get some advice about twinview...at the moment (within nVidia settings) I have twinview setup...when I maximise a window, it maximises to both windows...how can I set a window to only maximise to the monitor it is sitting in?
2007-12-02T22:15:00.000Z	mikebeecham		anyone please help on twinview?
2007-12-02T22:16:00.000Z	soundray	mikebeecham	have some patience. If someone knows the answer, they will reply. If not, retry in ten to fifteen minutes.
2007-12-02T22:23:00.000Z	soundray	mikebeecham	you asked a good question before. Now you've asked a poor one.
2007-12-02T22:25:00.000Z	soundray	mikebeecham	I'm giving you good advice about how to make use of IRC, which is to ask your original question again.
2007-12-02T22:25:00.000Z	soundray	mikebeecham	trust me, I know which type of question attracts responses. The frustrated ones don't.
2007-12-02T22:35:00.000Z	soundray	mikebeecham	there are instructions for how to set up twinview via xorg.conf in /usr/share/doc/nvidia-glx/README.txt.gz
2007-12-02T22:36:00.000Z	soundray	mikebeecham	maybe the issue with nvidia-settings not sticking is a permissions thing -- do you start it with gksudo?
2007-12-02T22:36:00.000Z	soundray	mikebeecham	also, see in /etc/X11/ whether there are files other than xorg.conf which might be in use in its place
2007-12-02T22:36:00.000Z	mikebeecham	soundray	no sudo
2007-12-02T22:37:00.000Z	soundray	mikebeecham	not sure whether that ^^ is at the root of your issue, though
2007-12-02T22:38:00.000Z	mikebeecham	soundray	...will restart X and see what happens...I have just made some changes in nvidia-settings based on that
2007-12-02T23:13:00.000Z	mikebeecham	soundray	I just wanted to drop on here and say thanks for the GKsudo suggestion...it worked!
2007-12-02T23:14:00.000Z	soundray	mikebeecham	I'm glad
2007-12-02T23:14:00.000Z	mikebeecham	soundray	me too :)
2007-12-02T23:16:00.000Z	soundray	mikebeecham	have you found a solution for the maximizing across two screens?
2007-12-02T23:16:00.000Z	mikebeecham	soundray	when I made the changes via gksudo, it seemed to do everything
2007-12-02T23:17:00.000Z	soundray	mikebeecham	excellent
2007-12-02T23:17:00.000Z	mikebeecham	soundray	yup...sorry about my bluntness earlier...was just a bit stressed mate
2007-12-02T23:17:00.000Z	soundray	mikebeecham	never let your frustration spoil your good manners ;)
2007-12-02T23:18:00.000Z	soundray	mikebeecham	easier said then done, I know.
2007-12-02T23:24:00.000Z	mikebeecham	soundray	yeah
