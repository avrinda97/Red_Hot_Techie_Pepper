2008-08-16T18:12:00.000Z	q0s	unop	i am already reading the man page. did you understand my problem?
2008-08-16T18:13:00.000Z	unop	q0s	did you read the sudo manpage properly?
2008-08-16T18:15:00.000Z	unop	q0s	 -S  The -S (stdin) option causes sudo to read the password from the standard input instead of the terminal device.  # straight from the sudo manpage
2008-08-16T18:16:00.000Z	unop	q0s	jeez.  see the -S flag to sudo .. as per my last comment to you
2008-08-16T18:16:00.000Z	q0s	unop	ok. standart input. i am not the bash king... whats about echo "pw" | sudo -S  mycmd?
2008-08-16T18:17:00.000Z	unop	q0s	brilliant, that's it
2008-08-16T18:18:00.000Z	q0s	unop	would that work? ssh user@server echo 'pw' | sudo -S shutdown -r now
2008-08-16T18:18:00.000Z	unop	q0s	I shouldn't think so .. you need to quote the command passed to ssh properly ... otherwise sudo -S shutdown -r now is run on the local machine
2008-08-16T18:19:00.000Z	unop	q0s	 ssh user@server "echo 'pw' | sudo -S shutdown -r now"
2008-08-16T18:19:00.000Z	q0s	unop	quote? hmm... 'ssh user@server echo 'pw' | sudo -S shutdown -r now' the server is at 100% ... i can test it and i just want to restart it with one cmd...
2008-08-16T18:21:00.000Z	unop	q0s	not like that, no
2008-08-16T18:21:00.000Z	q0s	unop	any other solution?
2008-08-16T18:22:00.000Z	unop	q0s	i already showed you .. see my last-but-one comment to you.
2008-08-16T18:22:00.000Z	unop	q0s	 ssh user@server "echo 'pw' | sudo -S shutdown -r now"
2008-08-16T18:22:00.000Z	q0s	unop	thanks. i will give it a try ...
2008-08-16T18:26:00.000Z	q0s	unop	there is a ! in the password
2008-08-16T18:26:00.000Z	q0s	unop	man page says nothing about "event not found"
2008-08-16T18:26:00.000Z	unop	q0s	that's the bash history thing.   set +H   and try again
2008-08-16T18:28:00.000Z	q0s	unop	accomplished? "set +H && ssh user@server echo 'pw!' | sudo -S shutdown -r now"
2008-08-16T18:28:00.000Z	unop	q0s	that ought to work .. though ideally set +H should be a separate command
