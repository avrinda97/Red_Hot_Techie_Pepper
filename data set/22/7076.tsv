2010-07-11T19:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nicofs	 if you got the .debs then install them.
2010-07-11T19:47:00.000Z	nicofs	Dr_Willis	sudo dpkg -i name.deb - or was that wrong??
2010-07-11T19:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nicofs	 or 'sudo gdebi whatever.deb'
2010-07-11T19:48:00.000Z	nicofs	Dr_Willis	after that command, it did install kernel and headers. so i guess the command was correct...
2010-11-25T17:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nicofs	 heh.. oh. :) not sure about that.
2010-11-27T14:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nicofs	 6 mo release cycle. everything eveutually gets out of date. If you want latest - try the PPA's
2011-03-09T18:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nicofs	 you can do a full/normal install to a usb drive if you wanted.
2011-03-09T18:32:00.000Z	nicofs	Dr_Willis	yes but for that i would have to burn a live cd and boot from that to install to a usb drive - i have ubuntu running on this pc already...
2011-03-09T18:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nicofs	 you can do it from 2 usb drives.. one has the live-install setup.. you then use to install to the 2nd usb.
2011-03-09T18:33:00.000Z	nicofs	Dr_Willis	isn't that a bit like re-inventing the wheel? I just tried to install ubiquity to do that, but it somehow crashed...
2011-03-09T18:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nicofs	 ive never triedt o install to a  differnt media from an installed system. I would think a lot of the files it needs would be missing.
2011-03-09T18:34:00.000Z	nicofs	Dr_Willis	but essentially, the live cd is an installed system, isn't it?
2011-03-09T18:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nicofs	 its special. and running from a 'casperized' setup
2011-03-09T18:44:00.000Z	nicofs	Dr_Willis	basically i want a portable persistent system to be used on as many as possible computers...
2011-03-09T18:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nicofs	 use a live cd setup with a persistant save file.
2011-03-09T18:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nicofs	 and be carefull what drivers you install on it.
2011-03-26T23:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nicofs	 install some vnc service. configure it to run what desktop you want., set up a ssh tunnel if its over the internet. (no need on a local lan) and connect.
2011-03-26T23:09:00.000Z	nicofs	Dr_Willis	i installed vinagre - but how do i set it up via console?
2011-03-26T23:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nicofs	 I dont think you want to use that one.. that one only shares teh current desktop. its limited.
2011-03-26T23:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nicofs	 stick to tightvnc, or vnc4server or some other vncserver you can configure easially.
2011-03-26T23:10:00.000Z	nicofs	Dr_Willis	ok... i'll try...
2011-03-26T23:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nicofs	 you could just ssh -X remotebox, and run an app. and not use vnc at all. this just shows a single app locally. not a whole desktop
