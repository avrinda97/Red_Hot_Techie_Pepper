2008-05-29T03:27:00.000Z	Uatec_		but i don't know why it would be looking there
2008-05-29T03:27:00.000Z	Uatec_		nith, that path doesn't exist, that's not where cd is
2008-05-29T03:27:00.000Z	Uatec_		a) i don't know where cd is
2008-05-29T03:27:00.000Z	Uatec_		b) i don't know where it's supposed to be
2008-05-29T03:28:00.000Z	Uatec_		c) i don't know why ld is looking there
2008-05-29T03:28:00.000Z	Uatec_		ahh
2008-05-29T03:28:00.000Z	Uatec_		well, i can use the cd command
2008-05-29T03:28:00.000Z	Uatec_		sorry Boohbah
2008-05-29T03:29:00.000Z	Uatec_		i don't know what it was before the crash, so i have no way to compare
2008-05-29T03:30:00.000Z	Uatec_		yes
2008-05-29T03:30:00.000Z	Boohbah	Uatec_	what were you doing when your machine crashed?
2008-05-29T03:31:00.000Z	Uatec_	Boohbah	,i wasn't doing much, but it was the host machine that crashed (this linux machine is a virtual machine in virtualbox)
2008-05-29T03:32:00.000Z	Boohbah	Uatec_	what OS is the host?
2008-05-29T03:32:00.000Z	Uatec_	Boohbah	vista
2008-05-29T03:32:00.000Z	Boohbah	Uatec_	the virtual disk is probably corrupted
2008-05-29T03:34:00.000Z	Boohbah	Uatec_	fsck /dev/sdx
2008-05-29T03:34:00.000Z	Boohbah	Uatec_	only fsck with disks unmounted, so if it's root do it at boot
2008-05-29T03:35:00.000Z	Boohbah	Uatec_	wait
2008-05-29T03:36:00.000Z	Boohbah	Uatec_	i think you need to boot with some option
2008-05-29T03:36:00.000Z	Boohbah	Uatec_	to run fsck before the root filesystem is mounted
2008-05-29T03:36:00.000Z	Uatec_	Boohbah	yes, i was going to google for that
2008-05-29T03:37:00.000Z	Boohbah	Uatec_	ok, great!
