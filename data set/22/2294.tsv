2012-05-10T12:18:00.000Z	thatoneguy		my laptop is running super hot in 12.04... any suggestions? It runs really cool in windows :-\
2012-05-10T12:19:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	does it also run hot if you are not logged in?
2012-05-10T12:38:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	do the fans sound noisier or quieter in ubuntu than windows (also check with your hand how much pressure/volume is coming out)
2012-05-10T12:39:00.000Z	thatoneguy	DarwinSurvivor	I'll take notice tomorrow... the fan on this thing is really quiet so I rarely notice it.
2012-05-10T12:42:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	have you noticed if unity is really slow? it could be that your graphics card has the wrong driver and the cpu is trying to do the grahic's card's job
2012-05-10T12:52:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	that makes me think you don't have the right video card drivers installed
2012-05-10T13:03:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	is there a little icon just to the left of the envelope icon at the top of the screen?
2012-05-10T13:04:00.000Z	thatoneguy	DarwinSurvivor	nope
2012-05-10T13:05:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	can you run "additional drivers" from the applications menu?
2012-05-10T13:07:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	ok, then it's most likely not a video card problem
2012-05-10T13:10:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	is it relatively cool right now?
2012-05-10T13:12:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	did you ever take temperature reading in windows (for comparison)?
2012-05-10T13:13:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	ok, then we'll test by feal
2012-05-10T13:14:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	please install "stress" (sudo apt-get install stress)
2012-05-10T13:16:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	ok, then run "stress -c 4" and tell me if it starts getting hot :)
2012-05-10T13:16:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	hit Ctrl+c to kill the program if it does get hot
2012-05-10T13:19:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	yes, it will run until you kill it
2012-05-10T13:19:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	sorry, should have mentioned that :P
2012-05-10T13:19:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	did it get hot?
2012-05-10T13:20:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	ok, then it's not your processor causing problems (that stress program just ran all 4 cpu cores to 100%)
2012-05-10T13:21:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	did you say that running compiz triggered it?
2012-05-10T13:22:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thatoneguy	brb
