2012-09-25T07:55:00.000Z	jhkier		mintetruly: you were trying to get linux on usb? this thing will basically created bootable for you one touch button.
2012-09-25T07:57:00.000Z	jhkier		anyone konw much about apache?
2012-09-25T07:58:00.000Z	scarrs	jhkier	what do you wanna know?
2012-09-25T07:58:00.000Z	jhkier	scarrs	well im trying to understand what the sites enabled files mean..
2012-09-25T07:59:00.000Z	jhkier	scarrs	ie what is the 'document root' and what is...directory...
2012-09-25T07:59:00.000Z	jhkier		i've left out directory before and still seems to work fine.. but all docs say repeat /var/www etc.
2012-09-25T08:00:00.000Z	scarrs	jhkier	documentroot is the actual dir where the pages will be served...
2012-09-25T08:00:00.000Z	jhkier		i started to guess that given it won't work without.
2012-09-25T08:00:00.000Z	jhkier		What about directory?
2012-09-25T08:00:00.000Z	scarrs		not sure about that one :)
2012-09-25T08:01:00.000Z	jhkier		gnea: why !Apache
2012-09-25T08:02:00.000Z	jhkier	scarrs	its odd... like everyone seems to follow the rule of repeating their document root in the directory section... but i don't really get it.
2012-09-25T08:02:00.000Z	scarrs	jhkier	altho I have been using apache for 10+ years
2012-09-25T08:02:00.000Z	scarrs	jhkier	I would just leave it blank
2012-09-25T08:04:00.000Z	jhkier	scarrs	well i have noticed that nothing seems to break  - no mater what you put in there. but its a small file, so ifugred everything in sites-enabled would be important
2012-09-25T08:05:00.000Z	scarrs	jhkier	you're on the right track bro ;)
2012-09-25T08:05:00.000Z	scarrs		(ain't apache fun)
2012-09-25T08:05:00.000Z	jhkier		i kind of figured it would be much more sophisticated... or perhaps I'm just an idoit.
2012-09-25T08:06:00.000Z	scarrs	jhkier	 nah, simple as pie :)
2012-09-25T08:06:00.000Z	scarrs		just leave your config files alone unless you're using a differnt dir to serve from
2012-09-25T08:07:00.000Z	scarrs	jhkier	and then you only have to change "documentroot" and serverroot
