2011-08-18T18:45:00.000Z	Cat-Meow		no one else has any ideas as to why I cannot connect to .asp sites?
2011-08-18T18:46:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	what do you mean cannot connect?
2011-08-18T18:48:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	this sounds like it would be specific to one server or that your entire internet connection is down. not that "all asp pages don't work but everything else does"
2011-08-18T18:49:00.000Z	Cat-Meow	escott	other people can get to those sites, I can get to them in everything BUT Ubuntu 11.04, and it's only those sites ending with .asp or .aspx that I have issues with
2011-08-18T18:53:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	what happens if you take the url and plug it into wget?
2011-08-18T18:54:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	wget -o google.html http://www.google.com/index.html vs wget -o asp.html http://something/that/ends/in.asp
2011-08-18T18:54:00.000Z	Cat-Meow	escott	please forgive me for being dumb, I never heard of wget, googling now though
2011-08-18T18:54:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	it will just download the page and save it to a file
2011-08-18T18:56:00.000Z	Cat-Meow	escott	where does it save it to?
2011-08-18T18:57:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	type pwd in the terminal and it will say
2011-08-18T18:59:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	can you please try an asp page that is not https
2011-08-18T18:59:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	perhaps www.w3schools.com/asp/default.asp
2011-08-18T19:02:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	so the problem is specific to access.pensacolastate.edu
2011-08-18T19:05:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	unclear, maybe an incompatibility between your SSL library and theirs? you could try telnet 150.176.79.129 443
2011-08-18T19:08:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	it seems to be on their side of the connection. they are blocking your connection
2011-08-18T19:08:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	some other things to try (a) can you ping access.pensacolastate.edu? (b) can you traceroute access....
2011-08-18T19:10:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	and can you telnet to another port (they don't appear to be running a server on port 80 though)
2011-08-18T19:12:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	seems like there is something wrong with your network setup. check your router https://192.168.1.1 if that doesn't work try http://192.168.1.1
2011-08-18T19:21:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	!paste us `route`
2011-08-18T19:23:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	i think your /etc/hosts is screwed up. route should resolve names unless you say route -n
2011-08-18T19:30:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	its not by default
2011-08-18T19:34:00.000Z	escott	Cat-Meow	also paste your /etc/hosts
