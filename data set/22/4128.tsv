2008-03-09T18:14:00.000Z	RodGo		hello 2 all, i need some help on routing all my outgoing traffic trough a proxy server
2008-03-09T18:15:00.000Z	RodGo		its because i want to download some xbox live region specific content
2008-03-09T18:15:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	what's your network look like?
2008-03-09T18:18:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	correction, maybe yeah...but you'll need a box to redirect that traffic
2008-03-09T18:28:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	you could use an ssh tunnel and not have to worry about the protocol.
2008-03-09T18:28:00.000Z	RodGo	Metuchen	you know what tools i should install to setup my proxy server
2008-03-09T18:32:00.000Z	RodGo	Metuchen	do you know how to configure iptables so that i can proxy my traffic to the vpn?
2008-03-09T18:33:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	yes...youll need to know the ports you're working with.
2008-03-09T18:34:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 3074 -j DNAT --to-destination localhost
2008-03-09T18:35:00.000Z	RodGo	Metuchen	i run that on my vps, right?
2008-03-09T18:35:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	then do "ssh -L 3074:<xbox-server>:3074 <user>@<remote-host>"
2008-03-09T18:36:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	this must be on your "firewall" between your xbox and the internet.
2008-03-09T18:38:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	you'll need to figure that out unless your xbox can be setup to use a proxy.
2008-03-09T18:38:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	but you can use iptables's LOG target to figure it out.
2008-03-09T18:39:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	problem is, your XBox would have to know how to use a socks proxy.
2008-03-09T18:43:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	the "*" won't work.
2008-03-09T18:43:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	and you'll need to redirect the traffic to that ssh tunnel.
2008-03-09T18:44:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	ssh -L <port>:65.59.234.161:<port> <user>@<US-remote-host>
2008-03-09T18:46:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	both those need to be run on your linux-based firewall.
2008-03-09T18:46:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	not the Us-based server.
2008-03-09T18:47:00.000Z	RodGo	Metuchen	iptables v1.3.6: Bad IP address `localhost'
2008-03-09T18:47:00.000Z	Metuchen	RodGo	then use "127.0.0.1" instead of localhost.
