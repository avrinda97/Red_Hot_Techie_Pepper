2007-03-29T11:01:00.000Z	pe6950		hey, I had a working xorg config, and then when I rebooted into windows and rebooted back, it now fails
2007-03-29T11:02:00.000Z	pe6950		and I tried to restore a working config with nvidia-xconfig, but that didn't work
2007-03-29T11:02:00.000Z	pe6950		yeah, I guess, I can't seem to get X to start now
2007-03-29T11:02:00.000Z	pe6950		all the logs say "No Screens found"
2007-03-29T11:03:00.000Z	pe6950		me as well
2007-03-29T11:03:00.000Z	pe6950		I am using the nvidia drivers (nvidia.com)
2007-03-29T11:05:00.000Z	pe6950		what do I do?
2007-03-29T11:05:00.000Z	pe6950		my xconfig was fine, and I rebooted, and now it no longer has a screen
2007-03-29T11:05:00.000Z	pe6950		or it doesn't think my screen section is valid
2007-03-29T11:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pe6950	new kernel?
2007-03-29T11:05:00.000Z	pe6950	thoreauputic	maybe, do I need to reinstall the driver?
2007-03-29T11:06:00.000Z	pe6950		I did run system update
2007-03-29T11:06:00.000Z	pe6950		k
2007-03-29T11:06:00.000Z	pe6950		wait, I like my xorg file
2007-03-29T11:06:00.000Z	pe6950		I don't want to totaly get rid of it
2007-03-29T11:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pe6950	yes, unless you are using the packaged ubuntu drivers ( nvidia-glx)
2007-03-29T11:06:00.000Z	pe6950		k
2007-03-29T11:07:00.000Z	pe6950		I will re-install drivers
2007-03-29T11:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pe6950	make a backup of the last known good xorg.conf
2007-03-29T11:07:00.000Z	pe6950		does anyone reccomend the beta drivers over the standard ones?
2007-03-29T11:07:00.000Z	pe6950	thoreauputic	I sure will
2007-03-29T11:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pe6950	;-)
