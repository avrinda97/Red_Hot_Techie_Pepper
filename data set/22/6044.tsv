2007-01-07T10:01:00.000Z	lale		I just installed feisty
2007-01-07T10:01:00.000Z	lale		herd 1
2007-01-07T10:01:00.000Z	lale		it rocks
2007-01-07T10:02:00.000Z	lale		Just a question: the update utility tells me I should do a dist-upgrade.  Why? Should I say OK?
2007-01-07T10:04:00.000Z	I-kido	lale	it should be ok to upgrade, I see no harm in renewing ur system :)
2007-01-07T10:04:00.000Z	lale	I-kido	uhm OK.  But don't I have the feisty repos already? What repositories is he going to activate?
2007-01-07T10:05:00.000Z	I-kido	lale	feisty is beta, i wouldn't upgrade yet
2007-01-07T10:05:00.000Z	I-kido	lale	unless u r a developper :0
2007-01-07T10:05:00.000Z	lale	I-kido	I'm currently running feisty
2007-01-07T10:06:00.000Z	lale	I-kido	I just installed it from scratch (herd 1)
2007-01-07T10:06:00.000Z	lale	I-kido	no problems in it being unstable
2007-01-07T10:06:00.000Z	I-kido	lale	feisty will be released in april
2007-01-07T10:07:00.000Z	I-kido	lale	edgy runs fine, u could give it a try :)
2007-01-07T10:08:00.000Z	lale	I-kido	I just want to try feisty
2007-01-07T10:08:00.000Z	lale		I know edgy is fine :)
2007-01-07T10:08:00.000Z	I-kido		:)
2007-01-07T10:08:00.000Z	lale	I-kido	I'm not having problems with feisty now
2007-01-07T10:08:00.000Z	lale	I-kido	it was just a question about strange behaviour of the system update app
2007-01-07T10:08:00.000Z	I-kido	lale	feisty want to upgrade to what ?
2007-01-07T10:09:00.000Z	I-kido		lele: update is ok,  but dist-upgrade is usually a newer version of the distribution
2007-01-07T10:10:00.000Z	lale	I-kido	in fact, the strange thing is that I'm running the newest one, so... :)
