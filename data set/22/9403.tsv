2004-11-20T07:34:00.000Z	unperson	drakonim	Can't double check right now, but I was fairly sure that capability wasn't in there.  Are you sure it is?
2004-11-20T07:34:00.000Z	drakonim	unperson	yes, if you highlight the wifi card and click properties ((just looked again myself))
2004-11-20T07:35:00.000Z	unperson	drakonim	(Eh, can't double check insofar as it isn't in their right now, unless it is only there when a wireless card is in.  I can't have that and my normal nic in simultaneously)
2004-11-20T07:35:00.000Z	drakonim	unperson	thats correct... it will only give you wireless options if its a wireless card.
2004-11-20T07:36:00.000Z	unperson	drakonim	Ah, ok.  Does it list all the ESSIDs present?
2004-11-20T07:36:00.000Z	drakonim	unperson	no, you type in the one you want to connect to
2004-11-20T07:36:00.000Z	unperson	drakonim	present == on networks currently being picked up
2004-11-20T07:37:00.000Z	unperson	drakonim	Ah ok.  Better than nothing but still leaves something to be desired, so I will keep looking around.  Thanks, though.
2004-11-20T07:37:00.000Z	drakonim	unperson	no prob.  I dont think what youre looking for exists quite yet
2004-11-20T07:38:00.000Z	unperson	drakonim	Yeah.  There's a nice tool in KDE that's included with knoppix, but I don't recall the name.  Anyway, I guess if it's KDE specific it'd probably be a drag to run under Gnome.
2004-11-20T07:38:00.000Z	drakonim	unperson	probly a true statement :-D
2004-11-20T07:39:00.000Z	drakonim	unperson	not_so_gui but kismet can sniffem out (with a supported nic)
2004-11-20T07:41:00.000Z	unperson	drakonim	And you were right.  That was the minimum requirement.
2004-11-20T07:41:00.000Z	drakonim	unperson	ah, well glad to have helped in some fashion then :-D
2004-11-20T07:43:00.000Z	drakonim	unperson	kwifimanager is probly the thing you had working before
2004-11-20T07:44:00.000Z	unperson	drakonim	YES!  That's it.
2004-11-20T07:44:00.000Z	unperson	drakonim	So yeah, sound like a KDE QT app, darn.
2004-11-20T07:44:00.000Z	drakonim	unperson	indeed it is
2004-11-20T07:47:00.000Z	drakonim	unperson	if its python, then theres a change it py-gtk and therefore a gui
2004-11-20T07:48:00.000Z	unperson	drakonim	Yes, it's supposed to have a GTK+ GUI.
