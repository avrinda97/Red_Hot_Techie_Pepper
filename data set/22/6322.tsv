2007-05-06T09:22:00.000Z	SlimG	rukuartic	nope
2007-05-06T09:23:00.000Z	rukuartic	SlimG	Ok :P
2007-05-06T09:23:00.000Z	rukuartic	SlimG	Tried ndiswrapper?
2007-05-06T09:24:00.000Z	SlimG	rukuartic	Seems to be two drivers present for it already, ndiswrapper shouldn't be needed
2007-05-06T09:24:00.000Z	rukuartic	SlimG	Not necessarily.
2007-05-06T09:24:00.000Z	rukuartic	SlimG	I had a friend with the present drivers, and it didn't work... Ndis fixed it. Make sure to pull out the other ones and put them into /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2007-05-06T09:25:00.000Z	SlimG	rukuartic	Did he try the http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/ driver?
2007-05-06T09:25:00.000Z	rukuartic	SlimG	She :P Geeks can be girls too!
2007-05-06T09:26:00.000Z	rukuartic	SlimG	Naw, but it works and she's very happy with it.
2007-05-06T09:27:00.000Z	SlimG	rukuartic	Sorry, Female geeks simply doesn't excist here, so I'm pretty used to male geeks
2007-05-06T09:28:00.000Z	SlimG	rukuartic	Thanks for your help! I'll try the serialmonkey driver, then ndiswrapper
2007-05-06T09:28:00.000Z	rukuartic	SlimG	No problem
2007-05-06T09:28:00.000Z	rukuartic	SlimG	Don't forget to pull out the other mods
2007-05-06T09:28:00.000Z	rukuartic	SlimG	They conflict and make things not work.
2007-05-06T09:30:00.000Z	SlimG	rukuartic	I'll remember to blacklist them, thanks again
2007-05-17T09:05:00.000Z	rukuartic	SlimG	Ctrl+alt+f6 I think
2007-05-17T09:05:00.000Z	rukuartic	SlimG	ctrl+alt+f7 sends you back to a gui
2007-05-17T09:05:00.000Z	rukuartic	SlimG	ctrl+alt+f1-f6 are all terminals
2007-05-17T09:06:00.000Z	SlimG	rukuartic	isn't there a console command for that? (ssh connection)
2007-05-17T09:06:00.000Z	rukuartic	SlimG	Not sure.
