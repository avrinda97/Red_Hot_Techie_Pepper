2011-01-28T21:16:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChipCherou	do want a static IP ?
2011-01-28T21:24:00.000Z	ChipCherou	BluesKaj	sry got called away for a second...actually I want it left alone for my own script to through it with 0.0.0.0 (part of bridge)
2011-01-28T21:33:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChipCherou	what script ..in /etc/network/interfaces ?
2011-01-28T21:34:00.000Z	ChipCherou	BluesKaj	Im using my own script(for implementing server change roles etc..., so I need dhcp to stop running)
2011-01-28T21:35:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChipCherou	ok then you probly need a static IP setup on your networked pcs , correct ?
2011-01-28T21:36:00.000Z	ChipCherou	BluesKaj	Yep. Id like to se tthe ip's to 0.0.0.0statically
2011-01-28T21:39:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChipCherou	each pc should have a different static IP , you can setup each pc in /etc/network/interfaces for example http://paste.ubuntu.com/559580/
2011-01-28T21:43:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChipCherou	unless you're looking for a NAS setup . where all pcs autoconnect at boot...but that's beyond my scope atm
2011-01-28T21:43:00.000Z	ChipCherou	BluesKaj	Just need to have ubuntu leave the nic alone
2011-01-28T21:44:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChipCherou	ethernet connection?
2011-01-28T21:45:00.000Z	ChipCherou	BluesKaj	yep
2011-01-28T21:45:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChipCherou	then static IP is your best bet
2011-01-28T21:46:00.000Z	ChipCherou	BluesKaj	Im quite sure I tried that on ll my nics and dhcp was still told to load.  But Ill try again after my machine is done doing something.  ty for yorur assisntace.  If it isn't fixed Ill be back

2011-01-28T21:47:00.000Z	ChipCherou	BluesKaj	thanks  going to read now
2011-01-28T21:47:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChipCherou	the reason is that you're using network manager , it autoloads dhcp
2011-01-28T21:49:00.000Z	ChipCherou	BluesKaj	thanks for throwing that at me.  Thats a service that keeps interfering with some files of mine that gets annoying...perhaps disabling that will fix all my issues
2011-01-28T21:52:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChipCherou	if you're going to use static IP , then you can just use network/interfaces which is the conf file that runs ethernet
2011-01-28T21:53:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ChipCherou	you can even remove network manager because you won't need it
2011-01-28T21:56:00.000Z	ChipCherou	BluesKaj	thinking of just disabling it at first to see if theres any other issues that would arrise from it
2011-01-28T21:56:00.000Z	BluesKaj		dunno if you can just disable it, ChipCherou
2011-01-28T21:57:00.000Z	ChipCherou	BluesKaj	its in the /etc/init.d directory so i wold like to think tha tI can...if not I will happily remove it
