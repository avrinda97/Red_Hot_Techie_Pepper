2012-11-03T05:52:00.000Z	marcio		i find that mines a bit slow with 12.10
2012-11-03T05:53:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	I have a aceraspire d250 2 gigs ram it runs a bit slower then my dual core toshiba, bump the ram .
2012-11-03T06:09:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	I would set the swappiness to 10. http://askubuntu.com/questions/103915/how-do-i-configure-swappiness
2012-11-03T06:13:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	Take a look at the link I gave you.
2012-11-03T06:20:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	There is a app called startup applications, it needs to be loaded to see what runs at startup, you can turn off stuff you don't use like say bluetooth if your'e not using it etc, be careful here, the benefits are small but they are there.  sudo sed -i 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop
2012-11-03T06:21:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	 sudo sed -i 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop
2012-11-03T06:22:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	I figured you had a gig, I would run lxde, or lubuntu if it were me.
2012-11-03T06:24:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	here is what it looks like, you can install it and run it or what you have now with a gear dropdown at the login line.
2012-11-03T06:26:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	They are pretty much the same I think lubuntu just has a few more apps.
2012-11-03T06:28:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	^^^^^
2012-11-03T06:29:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	lxde and lubuntu just use some of the same basic apps, but different versions, for example leafpad as a text app rather then gedit.
2012-11-03T06:30:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	You would still have the software center it probably is in lxde, if installed in ubuntu, but you have it already it will not be removed.
2012-11-03T06:34:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	Some of us will have several desktops, I do as I like the gnome-shell more then unity, so I just install the shell on a regular ubuntu install that has unity. There is a website as well that has the complete package lists for the 4 main desktops used with ubuntu, so if you wanted you can remove a extra desktop if you wanted.
2012-11-03T06:47:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	If you are installing like lxde or lubuntu in ubuntu it is just another desktop environment
2012-11-03T06:51:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	At the login window you will see a gear next to the login line that is a drop down for choosing the desktop you want to run.
2012-11-03T07:52:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	I was only talking to the user who snapped at me, it gets tiresome.
2012-11-03T08:00:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	here is a background link, I will look for the reonve icons link next
2012-11-03T08:03:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	post 4 here kind of gives you the lowdown on gui's and lubuntu. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1875024
2012-11-03T08:07:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	Some things have to be done from text files, so you want to search on the web with exact dicriptions to find the info sometimes, it is a great desktop for someone in your position, but a little tricky to understand, and lower on the support as well. There is a #lubuntu channel but it has like 60 people there.
2012-11-03T08:10:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	marcio	could be I haven't used lubuntu much, but found it fairly easy to work with, but I have been using linux for awhile.
