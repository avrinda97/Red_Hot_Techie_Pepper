2009-10-05T12:19:00.000Z	genmail		Hi everyone, is there anyone who can help me?
2009-10-05T12:19:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	genmail	ask
2009-10-05T12:24:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	genmail	you want to install grub to the mbr of the usb hdd, and you will have to tell bios to boot from the usb hdd first in boot options
2009-10-05T12:29:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	genmail	change the boot order first to do cdrom>usbhdd>HD then boot with the cd with only the 1 usb hdd connected install it and it should by default ask you to install the grub to mbr on the usb hdd
2009-10-05T12:30:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	genmail	this way when the usb hdd is connected it will boot into grub and ubuntu, and when it is not it will skip it and boot from xp on the internal HD
2009-10-05T12:31:00.000Z	genmail	jasonmchristos	ubuntu 9.04 asks me to install the boot loader in the advanced options. should I choose sdb1 (as suggested) or hd1 or...what?
2009-10-05T12:32:00.000Z	genmail	jasonmchristos	cause I've already tried to do that, but the system doesn't start if the usb hdd is connected (the bios is ok)
2009-10-05T12:33:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	genmail	what system doesnt start? ubuntu will not start because its not connected
2009-10-05T12:33:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	genmail	just call me +13142929378
2009-10-05T12:34:00.000Z	genmail	jasonmchristos	when the usb hdd is connected ubuntu doesn't start. Actually nothing starts. Maybe I make something wrong when the installation asks me where to install the boot loader
2009-10-05T12:34:00.000Z	genmail	jasonmchristos	thanks but I'm in Italy
2009-10-05T12:35:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	genmail	when the usb is not connected what happens?
2009-10-05T12:36:00.000Z	genmail	jasonmchristos	when it's not connected XP starts, since I restored the mbr with XP cd
2009-10-05T12:37:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	genmail	ok so there is no grub on the internal HD we have established that, now i need to know what the boot order in your bios is
2009-10-05T12:38:00.000Z	genmail	jasonmchristos	it is 1) DVD-CD    2)USB HDD   3) internal HDD
2009-10-05T12:39:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	genmail	ok good, now just reinstall ubuntu on the USB HDD
2009-10-05T12:39:00.000Z	genmail	jasonmchristos	fine, and when it asks me where to install the boot loader what should I put?
2009-10-05T12:40:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	genmail	it should by default ask you to install grub on the MBR of the device you told it to install ubuntu on, in this past try did you select the default or what did you tell it?
2009-10-05T12:42:00.000Z	genmail	jasonmchristos	first I used the default (but when I disconnected the usb hdd it wasn't able to load XP). Then I tried to install the boot loader directly to the usb hdd (selection the "advanced" option) but the result was that ubuntu couldn't start and XP started only when the hdd was disconnected
2009-10-05T12:44:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	genmail	i cant see your screen so to be sure disable the internal HD when you install so it only gives you one choice, this way there is only one choice, im not sure what your usb hdd is listed as to tell you what to pick
2009-10-05T12:44:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	genmail	after you install it reenable the internal hdd in bios\
2009-10-05T12:44:00.000Z	genmail	jasonmchristos	ok, I'll try that, thank you very much
