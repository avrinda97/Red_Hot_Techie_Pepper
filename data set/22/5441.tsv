2007-06-23T08:59:00.000Z	Draconicus		Alright, WHAT THE HELL?! I'm getting so goddamned sick of this! Firefox is using monospace for its GUI font. I've completely removed and reinstalled it, and it STILL does it! What is going on?!
2007-06-23T09:00:00.000Z	Draconicus		"Hell" is in the bible. I don't see how it could be offensive.
2007-06-23T09:00:00.000Z	Gnea	Draconicus	calm yourself, then ask again.
2007-06-23T09:00:00.000Z	Gnea	Draconicus	Channel rules. Respect them.
2007-06-23T09:01:00.000Z	Gnea	Draconicus	I don't care, show some respect or you won't get any.
2007-06-23T09:01:00.000Z	Draconicus	Gnea	You try dealing with this for three months and then being calm about it.
2007-06-23T09:02:00.000Z	Gnea	Draconicus	that's no excuse. If you are unwilling to calm yourself, there are those who will show you which way to 'forceful' help is at.
2007-06-23T09:02:00.000Z	Draconicus	Gnea	My apologies. Thanks for spamming the channel to death in reprimand.
2007-06-23T09:05:00.000Z	Gnea	Draconicus	is the problem similar to this one? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/36585
2007-06-23T09:05:00.000Z	Draconicus	Gnea	Not in the slightest. I've already been through the bugs.
2007-06-23T09:06:00.000Z	Gnea	Draconicus	well, you're going to have to be a bit more specific as to what the real problem is instead of brushing aside any attempts to help.
2007-06-23T09:07:00.000Z	Gnea	Draconicus	so why not quit firefox, empty the folder out, and try launching it again?
2007-06-23T09:07:00.000Z	Draconicus	Gnea	I completely removed .mozilla, completely removed the firefox package, reinstalled, no fix.

2007-06-23T09:10:00.000Z	Gnea	Draconicus	that doesn't look like the default firefox theme...
2007-06-23T09:10:00.000Z	Draconicus	Gnea	It is. My system theme does that.
2007-06-23T09:11:00.000Z	Gnea	Draconicus	'system theme'? you mean gnome?
2007-06-23T09:11:00.000Z	Draconicus	Gnea	No, I mean Xfce. :P
2007-06-23T09:11:00.000Z	Gnea	Draconicus	have you tried fluxbox?
2007-06-23T09:11:00.000Z	Draconicus	Gnea	No. Leave me alone.
2007-06-23T09:11:00.000Z	Gnea	Draconicus	sod off.
