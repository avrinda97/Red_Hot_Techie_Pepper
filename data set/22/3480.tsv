2008-10-30T07:19:00.000Z	Appl3Kork		hey is there a command to make ubuntu passwordless?
2008-10-30T07:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	You can make it automatically log in.
2008-10-30T07:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	Go to login screen setup
2008-10-30T07:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	That's the terminal.  Why do you want it to log in automatically?
2008-10-30T07:21:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	Why do you want to log in to a server?
2008-10-30T07:21:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	You can set up key baesd authentication to log in via ssh without passwords.
2008-10-30T07:21:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	But again, what do you hope to gain from having a server with a tty that automatically logs in?
2008-10-30T07:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	Sure, log in, then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2008-10-30T07:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	Logging in locally has no affect on logging in remotely.
2008-10-30T07:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	that's entirely incorrect.  You've got some other problem going on.
2008-10-30T07:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	Ubuntu, yes.  But for a server, you'd be using nano.
2008-10-30T08:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP#After%20installing%20MySQL
2008-10-30T08:35:00.000Z	Appl3Kork	Flannel	it says ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
2008-10-30T08:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	Right, you need to set a password, etc.  Follow the instructions.
2008-10-30T08:39:00.000Z	Appl3Kork	Flannel	so if get this error: -bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('
2008-11-13T07:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	You can sneakernet it, download the deb to your thumbdrive
2008-11-13T08:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	download the deb, http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/alien
2008-11-13T08:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	then just double click the deb
2008-11-13T08:16:00.000Z	Appl3Kork	Flannel	I opened the deb file, and it says in red Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: debhelper
2008-11-13T08:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	then you'll need to download debhelper too (if you look at that site, it lists the dependencies, should be two more clicks)
2008-11-13T08:32:00.000Z	Appl3Kork	Flannel	everytime I go to open one of the deb files, it says it needs another deb file, and just keeps going?  Is there any other options to doing this?  I tried ethernet, but it's not connecting.
2008-11-13T08:37:00.000Z	Flannel	Appl3Kork	It can't go too far, since alien doesn't depend on a whole lot.  Synaptic has the capability to generate a download script for all the packages needed, but I believe you'd (obviously) have to be connected at least once first, to get the list of everything
