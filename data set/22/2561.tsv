2011-01-13T19:06:00.000Z	acicula	Lantizia	its a licensed format
2011-01-13T19:07:00.000Z	Lantizia	acicula	I know that ... tell me more
2011-01-13T19:09:00.000Z	acicula	Lantizia	Any software that is not available under an open license or emburdend with patents is not directly distributed with ubuntu
2011-01-13T19:10:00.000Z	Lantizia	acicula	the firefox logo is patented
2011-01-13T19:10:00.000Z	acicula	Lantizia	i would think its a trademark not a patent
2011-01-13T19:19:00.000Z	acicula	Lantizia	i cant really find a link that explains it nicely, but anything that itself is not available under an open license is (and in some cases must be) excluded from the distribution itself.
2011-01-13T19:20:00.000Z	acicula	Lantizia	which is also why you dont get H264 in firefox by default and so on
2011-01-13T19:21:00.000Z	Lantizia	acicula	see I'm actually trying to find the legal reasons why is why I ask - I'm having trouble finding it myself - but ages back (i think red hat were the first) the distros one by one drop it.... but oddly debian has things like the fluendo mp3 codec and libmad0 in their main repo
2011-01-13T19:22:00.000Z	acicula	Lantizia	you must distinguish between packaging it in the distribution installation media(cd/dvd/etc) and making it available for isntallation
2011-01-13T19:25:00.000Z	Lantizia	acicula	I thought the issue was obtaining of any kind (download, cd or other) the binary compiled decoder
2011-01-13T19:26:00.000Z	acicula	Lantizia	no, the gpl license specifically talks about bundling nonfree software and such
2011-01-13T19:26:00.000Z	Lantizia	acicula	but it's not non-free
2011-01-13T19:26:00.000Z	Lantizia	acicula	full source code
2011-01-13T19:27:00.000Z	acicula	Lantizia	yes, but emburdend by patents for which no license is given
2011-01-13T19:28:00.000Z	acicula	Lantizia	or other legal issues, like with libdvdcss which circumvents some drm protections
2011-01-13T19:30:00.000Z	Lantizia	acicula	if whomever you got your mp3 decoding from needs a license then how/why does debian offer it in their main repository?
2011-01-13T19:30:00.000Z	acicula	Lantizia	anyway source code is not free either, its still owned via copyright, just made available under an open license
2011-01-13T19:31:00.000Z	acicula	Lantizia	because its not illigal to offer the program or the source code
2011-01-13T19:31:00.000Z	Lantizia	acicula	then why is it illegal to offer but the program (but the source code is ok) for an encoder?
2011-01-13T19:33:00.000Z	acicula	Lantizia	(i think, im not a lawyer that) its not distributed with the distro itself because of the patent conflicts, and because it may be illigal for you to use in whatever country it is that you live in
2011-01-13T19:33:00.000Z	acicula	Lantizia	well i suppse illigal is the wrong term, you wont go to jail for violating a patent
2011-01-13T19:34:00.000Z	acicula	Lantizia	its basically what SCO does, they claim to own some patents that apply to certain parts of the linux kernel, and for that started sending licensing fee bills to companies known to use it
