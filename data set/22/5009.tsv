2008-12-25T21:38:00.000Z	Araen	Ape	nothing ^^ just I can't move or remove
2008-12-25T21:38:00.000Z	Ape	Araen	Do you see the partitions on it?
2008-12-25T21:39:00.000Z	Araen	Ape	yes (i've one partition)
2008-12-25T21:39:00.000Z	Ape	Araen	Can you right click the partion you see on the disk? Is there any available options?
2008-12-25T21:40:00.000Z	Araen	Ape	no, I can just see
2008-12-25T21:44:00.000Z	Ape	Araen	Could you take some screen shots or something to make this clearer?
2008-12-25T21:44:00.000Z	Araen	Ape	yeah, of course ^^
2008-12-25T21:48:00.000Z	Araen	Ape	I think you won't have anything to see the problem, I don't manage to take a screen (it's the first time it doesn't work, well...) but all buttons are disabled
2008-12-25T21:49:00.000Z	Ape	Araen	What is the partition's filesystem
2008-12-25T21:49:00.000Z	Ape	Araen	ext3, reiserFS, FAT*, NTFS?
2008-12-25T21:50:00.000Z	Ape	Araen	Filesystem should be on the second column of the list
2008-12-25T21:50:00.000Z	Ape	Araen	Is there "unmount" available on the right click menu?
2008-12-25T21:51:00.000Z	Araen	Ape	yes
2008-12-25T21:56:00.000Z	Araen	Ape	done, why ?
2008-12-25T21:56:00.000Z	Ape	Araen	The disk must be unmounted, so it can be accessed with gparted.
2008-12-25T21:56:00.000Z	Araen	Ape	if the disk is unmounted, how can I have an access on it ?
2008-12-25T21:57:00.000Z	Ape	Araen	Are the options now available? It umount still available? What filesystem do you have on the partition?
2008-12-25T21:58:00.000Z	Araen	Ape	yes, it works now ^^
2008-12-25T21:58:00.000Z	Ape	Araen	Now you know
