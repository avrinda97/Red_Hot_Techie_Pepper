2005-04-10T13:25:00.000Z	Jamminpotato		this linux hting seems prety not that bad
2005-04-10T13:26:00.000Z	Jamminpotato		now al i ahve to do is acutally install ubuntu instead of running the live cd =/
2005-04-10T13:27:00.000Z	Jamminpotato		the live cd acutally kicks large amounts of ass
2005-04-10T13:27:00.000Z	Jamminpotato		because it already has gaim, xchat, and firfox and OOo
2005-04-10T13:28:00.000Z	Jamminpotato		would the wise peoiple of #ubuntu recommened isntalling warty or hoary ATM, or should i jsut wait untill hoary is released fully and use that
2005-04-10T13:28:00.000Z	apokryphos	Jamminpotato	Hoary.
2005-04-10T13:28:00.000Z	apokryphos	Jamminpotato	I'm not even sure if there's anyone with Warty in here. :)
2005-04-10T13:29:00.000Z	apokryphos	Jamminpotato	there might be a couple
2005-04-10T13:29:00.000Z	apokryphos	Jamminpotato	not at all. Have you got warty?
2005-04-10T13:30:00.000Z	apokryphos	Jamminpotato	If you have that installed, you only need to edit one file and two commands, and you've got hoary.
2005-04-10T13:30:00.000Z	apokryphos	Jamminpotato	www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/guidetohoary
2005-04-10T13:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	Jamminpotato	;-)
2005-04-10T13:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	Jamminpotato	which version were you using?
2005-04-10T13:35:00.000Z	apokryphos	Jamminpotato	3.4 on Hoary is *seriously* worth trying out.
2005-04-10T13:35:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	apokryphos	i was using whatever came with suse enterprise 9.2
2005-04-10T13:36:00.000Z	apokryphos	Jamminpotato	looks like that was 3.2. Heh. Quite dated.
2005-04-10T13:36:00.000Z	apokryphos	Jamminpotato	for reference, #kubuntu exists
2005-04-11T12:31:00.000Z	apokryphos	Jamminpotato	You can always man apt-get, don't forget. ;-)
2005-04-12T05:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	Jamminpotato	check man rm
2005-04-12T05:36:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	apokryphos	i man'd it and used the -d modifierr but it syas it cant becuase its a directory
2005-04-12T05:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	Jamminpotato	you don't use d. You use -r, since you want to delete things recursively. Be careful with the command, however!
2005-04-12T05:38:00.000Z	Jamminpotato	apokryphos	 thanks
