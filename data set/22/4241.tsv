2008-02-12T21:07:00.000Z	ijusten	Bodsda	the ideal would be simple and clear manual how to undo all my mistakes and start from square one again
2008-02-12T21:07:00.000Z	Bodsda	ijusten	can you not just do   alsa --replace
2008-02-12T21:08:00.000Z	ijusten	Bodsda	I'm a noob
2008-02-12T21:08:00.000Z	Bodsda	ijusten	that wont fix it,.,.      laptop or desktop?
2008-02-12T21:10:00.000Z	Bodsda	ijusten	what does      asoundconf list       give you?
2008-02-12T21:12:00.000Z	Bodsda	ijusten	you can use tab, to complete names,.,. easier for me to read if you get it right ;~),.,. what is the sound cards then,.,. tell me the output
2008-02-12T21:12:00.000Z	ijusten	Bodsda	true true. Sorry. Anyway, Ubuntu is working otherwise like a charm. It's like the os of my dreams and I don't want to lose it over sound-issues!
2008-02-12T21:13:00.000Z	Bodsda	ijusten	i no,.,. so tell me what was listed from that command
2008-02-12T21:13:00.000Z	ijusten	Bodsda	it just said that "Names of available sound cards:" and then blank
2008-02-12T21:14:00.000Z	Bodsda	ijusten	you mean it didnt give you a name of a soundcard?
2008-02-12T21:14:00.000Z	ijusten	Bodsda	no.
2008-02-12T21:14:00.000Z	Bodsda	ijusten	do this              lspci | grep -i sound                 and        lspci | grep -i media
2008-02-12T21:14:00.000Z	ijusten	Bodsda	it didn't. But I happen to know for a fact that lspci gave it as nVidia Corporation MCP51 High Definition Audio (rev a2)
2008-02-12T21:15:00.000Z	Bodsda	ijusten	ok now type this           asoundconf set-default-card MCP51
2008-02-12T21:16:00.000Z	ijusten	Bodsda	it didn't do anything. At least, it didn't say anything.
2008-02-12T21:17:00.000Z	ijusten	Bodsda	asoundconf still leaves a blank
2008-02-12T21:17:00.000Z	Bodsda	ijusten	bear in mind, if somethin doesnt give an output, its usually a good thing,,.;~)   now right click on the speaker in the top right,. open sound controlm..file,.change device,.pick your device
2008-02-12T21:20:00.000Z	ijusten	Bodsda	I try to access volume control and it says that I dont have Gstreamer installed
2008-02-12T21:20:00.000Z	ijusten	Bodsda	probably will try doing that :P
2008-02-12T21:20:00.000Z	Bodsda	ijusten	search synaptic for gstreamer
2008-02-12T21:39:00.000Z	ijusten	Bodsda	I tried to troubleshoot myself and googled thishttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=205449 I got to three (see if alsa driver exists) but I don't think the link is valid anymore
