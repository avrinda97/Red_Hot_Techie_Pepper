2011-08-30T23:30:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	err
2011-08-30T23:31:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	i restarted and then all of my drives got mounted
2011-08-30T23:31:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	they've never done that before
2011-08-30T23:31:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	still don't have permission to mount/unmount them though (without the sudo command)
2011-08-30T23:32:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	this was strange as heck, it tells me i'm not the owner of the drives, but "root" is
2011-08-30T23:32:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	TehAndrewRyan_	if they are listed in /etc/fstab that's normal, either that or udev/or even some other app did it
2011-08-30T23:33:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	yes they're all listed there
2011-08-30T23:34:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	though i've somehow lost all permissions for the drives
2011-08-30T23:34:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	since ubuntu claims them to be owned by root, and bot by me
2011-08-30T23:34:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	not by me*
2011-08-30T23:34:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	TehAndrewRyan_	that's normal, as for ownership i don't know how to do that but that involves a app called 'chown'
2011-08-30T23:35:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	is there like a system restore feature in ubuntu? or do i have to reinstall it to make everything factory defaults?
2011-08-30T23:36:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	TehAndrewRyan_	no idea on that one, i'm sory
2011-08-30T23:36:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	TehAndrewRyan_	all you need is ownership back right?
2011-08-30T23:36:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	yes
2011-08-30T23:37:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	but when i'm here, i wanna ask something about pulseaudio too
2011-08-30T23:37:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	TehAndrewRyan_	ok, ask this - 'how would i use chown to gain ownership of external media?'
2011-08-30T23:40:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	how comes i get a 2 second delay in skype? when i talk, the participants won't hear my voice until about 2 seconds after i spoke
2011-08-30T23:40:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	it only happens with pulseaudio, not with ALSA
2011-08-30T23:43:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	TehAndrewRyan_	no idea, channel might know; for second questions it's always best to ask the channel
2011-08-30T23:44:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	ok, i fixed the permissions for mounting/unmounting drives now with a program called Pysdm
2011-08-30T23:44:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan_	aeon-ltd	still have to fix the ownership
