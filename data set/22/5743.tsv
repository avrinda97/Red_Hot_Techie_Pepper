2010-10-15T23:36:00.000Z	datacrusher		hello, im using unetbootin to make a usb drive, tryed MANY isos till now, everyone on booting i got "boot error"
2010-10-15T23:36:00.000Z	datacrusher		is there another way to do a usb boot installation from an iso instead of unetbootin?
2010-10-15T23:36:00.000Z	c0nv1ct	datacrusher	you tried pendrivelinux.com?
2010-10-15T23:42:00.000Z	datacrusher	c0nv1ct	well, iv seen the multi boot options, but still dont mention anything to use a custom .iso to make the usb bootable
2010-10-15T23:42:00.000Z	c0nv1ct	datacrusher	nope, no need for a custom iso
2010-10-15T23:43:00.000Z	datacrusher	c0nv1ct	well, i want to use one. i need to install kxstudio
2010-10-15T23:43:00.000Z	datacrusher		its a kubuntu studio mix,
2010-10-15T23:43:00.000Z	c0nv1ct	datacrusher	talk to their devs then
2010-10-15T23:44:00.000Z	datacrusher		well, but iv tryed ubuntu and kubunt 10 using unerbootin, neither worked also
2010-10-15T23:44:00.000Z	c0nv1ct	datacrusher	it worked for me
2010-10-15T23:44:00.000Z	c0nv1ct		using 10.4 and 10.10 recently
2010-10-15T23:44:00.000Z	datacrusher		iv tryed with ultimatebootcd and clonezilla isos that i had here just for testint, didnt worked also
2010-10-15T23:45:00.000Z	datacrusher		is there any details im missing? im using unetbootin in windows vista, formated the usb with fat32
2010-10-15T23:45:00.000Z	c0nv1ct	datacrusher	has anything worked at all? it is sounding more like there is a problem with the drive
2010-10-15T23:45:00.000Z	datacrusher		well, dragging files works
2010-10-15T23:46:00.000Z	datacrusher		i can use it in anther pcs too
2010-10-15T23:46:00.000Z	datacrusher		but the boot that dont
2010-10-15T23:46:00.000Z	datacrusher		tryed in different cpters the boot too, a notebook and 2 desktops that has bios usb booting options
2010-10-15T23:50:00.000Z	datacrusher	c0nv1ct	I believe GRUB has changed on Ubuntu recently and UNetBootIn no longer works, nor does Linux Live Loader etc.
2010-10-15T23:50:00.000Z	datacrusher		It might do, however i've tried many times and had no luck getting it to boot.
2010-10-15T23:50:00.000Z	datacrusher		at least found more people with the same issue, still googling
2010-10-15T23:51:00.000Z	c0nv1ct	datacrusher	doesnt the iso use isolinux to boot?
