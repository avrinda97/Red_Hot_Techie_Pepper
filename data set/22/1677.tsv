2012-10-22T20:01:00.000Z	cnf		what's the best way to remap capslock to control in unity?
2012-10-22T20:01:00.000Z	jrib	cnf	should be some options in keyboard preferences
2012-10-22T20:02:00.000Z	cnf	jrib	indeed, there is
2012-10-22T20:03:00.000Z	jrib	cnf	if you're a vim user, let me plug https://github.com/alols/xcape
2012-10-22T20:03:00.000Z	cnf	jrib	i'll have a look at it later
2012-10-24T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	cnf	if I can offer an alternative, have you considered simply using tmux or screen instead of two terminals?
2012-10-24T16:15:00.000Z	cnf	jrib	 no, because that is again, a totally different workflow which doesn't fit me
2012-10-24T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	cnf	ok
2012-10-24T16:17:00.000Z	jrib	cnf	how do you start the terminal?
2012-10-24T16:18:00.000Z	cnf	jrib	i click the terminal icon twice
2012-10-24T16:32:00.000Z	jrib	cnf	if I were in your shoes, I would do the following (I presume you are on 12.10 so I cannot help much as I'm still on 12.04): check dconf-editor for a relevant setting; apt-get source gnome-terminal and figure out what changed regarding how new tabs are handled (and then find a suitable way to change the behavior)
2012-10-24T16:44:00.000Z	jrib	cnf	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1302396/ unless something changed in 12.10 you're out of luck unless you want to hack gnome-terminal.  Although I guess you should go look at terminal_screen_get_current_dir_with_fallback too.  Depends how committed you are
2012-10-24T16:46:00.000Z	cnf	jrib	 yeah, i'm not gonna hack gnome-terminal ^^; looking for another term emulator :/
2012-11-28T01:16:00.000Z	jrib	cnf	there might be more info if you /msg ubottu install
2012-11-28T01:16:00.000Z	cnf	jrib	yes, if any of the stuff would actually work...
2012-11-28T01:16:00.000Z	jrib	cnf	you're going to have to be more specific...
2012-11-28T01:18:00.000Z	cnf	jrib	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent nothing on there is of much use since i don't have an optical drive, don't have a linux handy, nor a windows
2012-11-28T01:18:00.000Z	jrib	cnf	so what do you have?
2012-11-28T01:24:00.000Z	jrib	cnf	there should be instructions on one of those pages (either from /msg ubot93 install or the !persistent factoid) about creating a live usb manually. You could also just install ubuntu in a vm and then use the usb-creator-gtk
2012-11-28T01:28:00.000Z	cnf	jrib	instructions aplenty, with half the stuff out dated
2012-11-28T01:29:00.000Z	jrib	cnf	sure.  You may have to do some homework as well.  But the instructions are there for creating it manually by just mounting the iso and copying files
2012-11-28T01:29:00.000Z	jrib	cnf	it's on the !persistent page
