2006-01-04T16:17:00.000Z	egkamp	Renich	I've had ubuntu installed for only about 8 hours, and I'm impressed that everything worked "out of the box", and it seems snappy
2006-01-04T16:17:00.000Z	Renich	bob832	I'm looking for other kind of reasons... like, uptodate software, great filesystem usage, standard compilance, etc
2006-01-04T16:18:00.000Z	Renich		ok, anyone used Fedora Core here?
2006-01-04T16:18:00.000Z	Renich		any comparisson notes?
2006-01-04T16:19:00.000Z	egkamp		I had to install and configure Fedora Core in my Operating Systems class, once, but I've never actually used it
2006-01-04T16:19:00.000Z	Renich		what about the standard directory hierarchy?
2006-01-04T16:20:00.000Z	egkamp		we installed fedora and win2000 on local networks, yep
2006-01-04T16:20:00.000Z	Renich		ok, thanx guys for the input... so far the veredict is that ubuntu is more beautiful than anything... right?
2006-01-04T16:21:00.000Z	Renich		not at all coz... just asking
2006-01-04T16:21:00.000Z	egkamp	Renich	I used to use Mandrake, but I got tired of everything pointing me to a mandrake site...
2006-01-04T16:21:00.000Z	Renich		well, support is defenetly important
2006-01-04T16:21:00.000Z	egkamp	Renich	for instance, opening XChat would automaticly log me into #mandriva, regardless of what i was doing...
