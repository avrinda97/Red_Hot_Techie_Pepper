2007-02-18T07:36:00.000Z	jedi__		Hello
2007-02-18T07:38:00.000Z	jedi__		OK. How do I get my borders on my windows back.Im using beryl & recently updated to 9629
2007-02-18T07:39:00.000Z	wrox	jedi__	reinstall the nvidia driver
2007-02-18T07:40:00.000Z	wrox	jedi__	i've had this problem and the libGL.so.1 was fscked up
2007-02-18T07:40:00.000Z	jedi__	wrox	i did that, but might give it another go
2007-02-18T07:43:00.000Z	jedi__	wrox	I saw this as the solution on ubuntuguide - but am having trouble editing that file
2007-02-18T07:43:00.000Z	jedi__		wrox:The most likely fix is:
2007-02-18T07:43:00.000Z	jedi__		Change the firstline of /usr/bin/beryl-settings with : From
2007-02-18T07:43:00.000Z	jedi__		   1. !/usr/bin/env python
2007-02-18T07:43:00.000Z	jedi__		To
2007-02-18T07:43:00.000Z	jedi__		   1. !/usr/bin/env python2.5
2007-02-18T07:44:00.000Z	wrox	jedi__	don't edit no files.. just reinstall the driver... but first open a terminal and run 'beryl --replace' .. what does it say
2007-02-18T07:44:00.000Z	wrox		just wondering, perhaps ubuntu should adopt this stuff: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobolinux
2007-02-18T07:45:00.000Z	jedi__	wrox	nvidia present, xgl absent
2007-02-18T07:45:00.000Z	wrox	jedi__	make sure you are using "nvidia" driver in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-02-18T07:45:00.000Z	jedi__	wrox	iam
2007-02-18T07:45:00.000Z	wrox	jedi__	you should be using AIGLX
2007-02-18T07:46:00.000Z	jedi__	wrox	ill check the forums again, thanks though
2007-02-18T07:46:00.000Z	wrox	jedi__	if you played with howtos and edited your files, try to revert those edits
2007-02-18T07:47:00.000Z	wrox	jedi__	as last resort, download nvidia driver from nvidia yourself, and run it with -s option
