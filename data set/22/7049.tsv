2006-06-08T12:37:00.000Z	Faileas		hmm
2006-06-08T12:38:00.000Z	Faileas		my apt keeps segfaulting, does anyone know a way to fix it?
2006-06-08T12:38:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Faileas	Does dpkg segfault too ?
2006-06-08T12:39:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Faileas	Give it a shot. If it segfaults as well, its a dpkg problem.
2006-06-08T12:40:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Faileas	Um... sort of. You could try grabbing a blah-ubuntu.deb package from some trusted site and installing it with dpkg ...
2006-06-08T12:40:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Faileas	Or going to /var/lib/apt/archives and try installing something from there ...
2006-06-08T12:44:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Faileas	Ok, just a moment then ...
2006-06-08T12:45:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Faileas	What about /var/lib/dpkg/available ? Does it exist? Is it corrupt ?
2006-06-08T12:46:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Faileas	Though I don't know how to check the corrupt part :-p
2006-06-08T12:47:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Faileas	Then file a bug report. Get a backtrace first though (http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProgramCrash )
2006-06-08T12:47:00.000Z	Faileas	neutrinomass	its there
2006-06-08T12:47:00.000Z	Faileas	neutrinomass	what info do i need to give?
2006-06-08T12:48:00.000Z	Faileas	neutrinomass	in that case, i should reinstall everything?
2006-06-08T12:49:00.000Z	Faileas	neutrinomass	i can't do what, apt is broken
2006-06-08T12:49:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Faileas	If it is corrupt? I'm not sure.... I was asking because I've opened a bug report on how dpkg crashes if there is no /var/lib/dpkg/available.... Well besides the backtrace I'm not sure what's needed...
2006-06-08T12:49:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Faileas	Oh, you don't have gdb ?
2006-06-08T12:49:00.000Z	Faileas	neutrinomass	no...
2006-06-08T12:49:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Faileas	Sorry, yes, you can't get the source.
2006-06-08T12:50:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Faileas	That's a tough one ...
2006-06-08T12:52:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Faileas	The only thing that I can think of is installing gcc, autotools, gdb and dpkg from source (the latter with debugging symbols, read the INSTALL file on how to do this,  I think you need ./configure --debug or something) and get a backtrace ....
2006-06-08T12:52:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Faileas	If that's too much, just file the bug report and say you can't get a backtrace because you can't install anything ...
2006-06-08T12:53:00.000Z	Faileas	neutrinomass	its quite a bit
