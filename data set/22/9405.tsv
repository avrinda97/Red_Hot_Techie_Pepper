2004-11-12T09:18:00.000Z	adsb-work	agwibowo	Two choices. Convince someone to package clamav 0.80 for Ubuntu, or ignore it :)
2004-11-12T09:18:00.000Z	agwibowo	ogra	coz i cant update the virus database unless i get newer version of clamav
2004-11-12T09:19:00.000Z	adsb-work	agwibowo	It *does* update, it just can't use all of the functionality

2004-11-12T09:20:00.000Z	adsb-work	agwibowo	That's a successful database update. Are you running clamd?
2004-11-12T09:20:00.000Z	agwibowo		i think so...
2004-11-12T09:20:00.000Z	adsb-work		Then you should have /etc/clamav/clamav.conf ...
2004-11-12T09:20:00.000Z	agwibowo		err no
2004-11-12T09:20:00.000Z	agwibowo		i did not run it
2004-11-12T09:20:00.000Z	agwibowo		how to run it? i don't have it.. should i download it?
2004-11-12T09:21:00.000Z	adsb-work	agwibowo	If you want to run clamav as a daemon, install clamav-daemon :)
