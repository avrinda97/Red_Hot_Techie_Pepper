2010-10-17T11:51:00.000Z	barbseven		I have a macbook pro 5,5; I love ubuntu and am getting ready to make the switch to ubuntu again, but I have tried it once before, everything does work after some playing around, but one issue i have with it is, the wireless takes forever to connect, like 5 minutes, its the airport extreme. ubuntu supplies the B43 and STA broadcom driver. but these don't work very well, and when my download speed is topping out the wireless 
2010-10-17T11:51:00.000Z	barbseven		disconnect, please tell me someone has a solution?
2010-10-17T11:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barbseven	could try ndiswrapper instead
2010-10-17T11:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barbseven	why the 'lol'?
2010-10-17T11:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barbseven	go research it up. Its used if no native solution exists
2010-10-17T11:55:00.000Z	barbseven	ActionParsnip	thankyou I will have a look now, I have been searching for a solution for quite a while now
2010-10-17T11:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barbseven	it uses the windows driver
2010-10-17T11:56:00.000Z	barbseven	ActionParsnip	that doesn't sound very elegant?
2010-10-17T11:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barbseven	sure but it works
2010-10-17T11:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barbseven	when the connection drops, run: dmesg | tail
2010-10-17T11:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barbseven	doesit mention ipv6?
2010-10-17T11:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barbseven	in the output of the command is ipv6 mentioned
2010-10-17T12:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barbseven	jeez. Get the wireless connected. When it drops run the command. Can you see the 4 characters: ipv6 in the output. Its as simple as it sounds
2010-10-17T12:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barbseven	use eye, can you see "ipv6" in the words outputted
