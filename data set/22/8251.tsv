2005-09-24T16:50:00.000Z	WebLOCH		Anyone awake ?
2005-09-24T16:50:00.000Z	WebLOCH		Ahhh awesome, people that are awake!
2005-09-24T16:51:00.000Z	WebLOCH		I've been doing some reading to try and get my keyb/mouse set running but to no avail, I was hoping to find someone that might have an idea
2005-09-24T16:53:00.000Z	WebLOCH		Can I PM you ?
2005-09-24T16:54:00.000Z	WebLOCH		Ahh right I upgraded from Hoary to Breezy
2005-09-24T16:54:00.000Z	WebLOCH		But its a very similar process
2005-09-24T16:54:00.000Z	WebLOCH		If you edit your sources list you can get a list of packages from Breezy
2005-09-24T16:54:00.000Z	WebLOCH		And then select the ones you want specifically
2005-09-24T16:55:00.000Z	WebLOCH		Anyone here fancy addressing a hardware problem ?
2005-09-24T16:56:00.000Z	persia	WebLOCH	What sort of hardware problem?
2005-09-24T16:57:00.000Z	persia	WebLOCH	That's not a hardware problem.  Many people reported that they needed to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf when upgrading (although I thought that was fixed).  Check to make sure you are using the kbd driver in the appropriate InputSection.
2005-09-24T16:58:00.000Z	WebLOCH	persia	I dont suppose you have any source material for me to read on that. Im still a *nixnovice
2005-09-24T16:59:00.000Z	persia	WebLOCH	Ummm..   man xorg.conf is fairly unfreindly.  If you don't have a special setup, you could try just running sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, which ought to fix it.
2005-09-24T16:59:00.000Z	persia	WebLOCH	It should.  It won't work very nicely under X.
2005-09-24T05:23:00.000Z	persia	WebLOCH	Did you get any errors when running dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
2005-09-24T05:24:00.000Z	persia	WebLOCH	Would you mind putting the InputDevice sections of your xorg.conf in the pastebin?  I'm not sure I can help, but I've been digging through docs on InputDevices recently trying to get all my keys to work.
2005-09-24T05:46:00.000Z	persia	WebLOCH	Ummm...  You really should have an /etc/X11 if you have any X environment.  You spoke earlier of a "login screen".  Can you describe that?
2005-09-24T05:48:00.000Z	persia	WebLOCH	It really shouldn't be able to get that far without /etc/X11.
2005-09-24T05:50:00.000Z	persia	WebLOCH	You'd need either ls | grep X or ls | grep -i x.  Try again please.
2005-09-24T06:00:00.000Z	persia	WebLOCH	I don't see anything wrong with that.  It should be collecting keyboard events from the same source used for the virtual consoles.  My apologies that I cannot be of more help.
2005-09-24T06:01:00.000Z	persia	WebLOCH	If you decide to reinstall, you may do as well to reinstall Breezy Colony 4, as it may just work.
2005-09-24T06:02:00.000Z	persia	WebLOCH	Ah..  Well, at least Hoary will be supported for some time in the future :)
