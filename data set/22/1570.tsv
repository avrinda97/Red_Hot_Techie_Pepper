2010-04-08T01:12:00.000Z	Godslastering		when i click share connections on ipv4 on eth0 in my network manager, what is it really doing? how would i do the EXACT same thing via command line?
2010-04-08T01:14:00.000Z	maginot	Godslastering	echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forwarding
2010-04-08T01:14:00.000Z	Godslastering	maginot	thats it?
2010-04-08T01:14:00.000Z	maginot	Godslastering	this starts ip forward, what is used for connection sharing ..
2010-04-08T01:15:00.000Z	maginot	Godslastering	you still will have to enable dhcp and things like that to make all work of course
2010-04-08T01:15:00.000Z	Godslastering	maginot	how can i set that up? i want to emulate the EXACT results of enabling that option in network manager
2010-04-08T01:16:00.000Z	maginot	Godslastering	I told what a connection share basicly is, but I think you are talking about "Shared with other computers"  optiong in the Method option, aren't you ?
2010-04-08T01:17:00.000Z	Godslastering	maginot	^
2010-04-08T01:17:00.000Z	Godslastering	maginot	i want to do that exact thing via command-line
2010-04-08T01:18:00.000Z	Godslastering	maginot	i need to do the exact thing via command-line since i dont have a window manager :p
2010-04-08T01:18:00.000Z	maginot	Godslastering	I think that is a complete different thing...
2010-04-08T01:18:00.000Z	Godslastering	maginot	ah, do you know how to do it?
2010-04-08T01:18:00.000Z	maginot	Godslastering	what happen when you choose that option ?
2010-04-08T01:18:00.000Z	Godslastering	maginot	i CANT choose the option, because i dont have a window manager lol
2010-04-08T01:19:00.000Z	maginot	Godslastering	ok, but if you need that option so I suppose you know what you expect to happen, right?
2010-04-08T01:20:00.000Z	Godslastering	maginot	yes, i know what it does, because i use it on another computer which DOES have a window manager, i just now need it on a computer without a window manager
2010-04-08T01:21:00.000Z	maginot	Godslastering	so, that is what I'm asking you, what it does, if you tell me maybe I can tell you what to do in command line
2010-04-08T01:21:00.000Z	Godslastering	maginot	it allows computer 2 to get an internet connection through computer 1's connection
2010-04-08T01:22:00.000Z	maginot	Godslastering	so the answer is the echo command  I told you in  the first moment =)
2010-04-08T01:22:00.000Z	Godslastering	maginot	aye aye, thanks :^)
2010-04-08T01:23:00.000Z	maginot	Godslastering	but like I said, maybe in command line you have to do other things too
2010-04-08T01:23:00.000Z	Godslastering	maginot	ok, ill try it out
