2009-10-22T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Avash	its aother virtualisation solution
2009-10-22T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Avash	sudo apt-get install sugar
2009-10-22T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Avash	make sure you have universe repos enabled if it fails
2009-10-22T14:48:00.000Z	Avash	ActionParsnip	no it is not working
2009-10-22T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Avash	its in the repos, do you have universe repos enabled?
2009-10-22T14:49:00.000Z	Avash	ActionParsnip	i donk know
2009-10-22T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Avash	dont you think thats why its not working...
2009-10-22T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Avash	run synaptic, click sources and put ticks next to the universe repos
2009-10-22T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Avash	then exit synaptic
2009-10-22T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Avash	you can now run: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install sugar
2009-10-22T14:50:00.000Z	Avash	ActionParsnip	the update is not running
2009-10-22T14:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Avash	ubottu not only tells you if a package exists but also a description and most importantly, which repo it is on. if you dont have that repo enabled then you wont get it
2009-10-22T14:51:00.000Z	Avash	ActionParsnip	and also i dont have universe repos in my synaptic.
2009-10-22T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Avash	its under settings -> repositories
2009-10-22T14:53:00.000Z	Avash	ActionParsnip	there is no settings
2009-10-22T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Avash	you can always do it manually by editting /etc/apt/sources.list   but with your demonstrated skill level I wouldnt recommend it
2009-10-22T14:56:00.000Z	Avash	ActionParsnip	yeah i have already updated that source.list. and what do you mean by my skills?
2009-10-22T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Avash	if you are having issues checking what repos you do and dont have i'm not going to send you into a systm file to uncomment repos out
