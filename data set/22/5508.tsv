2007-05-08T07:21:00.000Z	openminddj		Can someone assist me with the package manager.  When I go to update I have three failed repos and have no idea why
2007-05-08T07:22:00.000Z	Flannel	openminddj	which repositories
2007-05-08T07:22:00.000Z	openminddj	Flannel	want me to paste them? there are 3
2007-05-08T07:22:00.000Z	Flannel	openminddj	Just give the URLs, put them all on one line
2007-05-08T07:23:00.000Z	openminddj	Flannel	Whoops, not quite one line
2007-05-08T07:23:00.000Z	Flannel	openminddj	er... pastebin your sources.list
2007-05-08T07:24:00.000Z	Flannel	openminddj	/etc/apt/sources.list
2007-05-08T07:27:00.000Z	openminddj	Flannel	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/19722/
2007-05-08T07:28:00.000Z	Flannel	openminddj	er... that's how it looks in the file?
2007-05-08T07:28:00.000Z	Flannel	openminddj	the stuff at the bottom has those long lines like that?
2007-05-08T07:29:00.000Z	openminddj	Flannel	yes, that was a straight copt and paste
2007-05-08T07:29:00.000Z	Flannel	openminddj	odd.  Well, that explains why.  This is all screwed up.
2007-05-08T07:31:00.000Z	openminddj	Flannel	I bet this happened when I was checking and unchecking options in my package manager.  I was only choosing different sources, but when i put them back, i was left with the errors.  I believe this is a bug
2007-05-08T07:32:00.000Z	openminddj	Flannel	Are you able to provide the default sources.list file per chance?
2007-05-08T07:33:00.000Z	Flannel	openminddj	yeah, thats what it looks like.  Uh, file a bug about it (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/software-properties/+filebug) and include that sources.list with it (and instructions on what you did)
2007-05-08T07:33:00.000Z	Flannel	openminddj	so, right now copy that sources.list down somewhere, since we'll be fixing it right now so you can have a wokring system.
2007-05-08T07:34:00.000Z	openminddj	Flannel	in the process of doing just that.  How can i fix this in the mean time?
2007-05-08T07:34:00.000Z	openminddj	Flannel	will do
2007-05-08T07:34:00.000Z	Flannel	openminddj	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/19726/
2007-05-08T07:35:00.000Z	Flannel	openminddj	replace your sources.list with that one.  You might need to re-start your editor with sudo (gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list)
2007-05-08T07:38:00.000Z	openminddj	Flannel	Thanks! This worked wonders! Do you find it odd that my system is "up to date?"  I probably havent downloaded an update in about a week because of the messed up sources.list file i had
2007-05-08T07:40:00.000Z	openminddj	Flannel	Thanks for the help! Much Appreciation
