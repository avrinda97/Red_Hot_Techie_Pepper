2010-03-12T23:28:00.000Z	melodie_		hi niphlhell
2010-03-12T23:29:00.000Z	melodie_		I am looking for a difficult problem's answere
2010-03-12T23:29:00.000Z	melodie_		answer
2010-03-12T23:30:00.000Z	melodie_		I would like to find out what command line can give me the information about what graphic driver is in use in the system
2010-03-12T23:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	melodie_	grep -i driver /var/log/Xorg.0.log may help
2010-03-12T23:31:00.000Z	melodie_	erUSUL	thanks I try !
2010-03-12T23:33:00.000Z	melodie_	erUSUL	it has loaded.... 4 drivers and unloaded 2 : how many are left ? o_O
2010-03-12T23:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	melodie_	2 :)
2010-03-12T23:34:00.000Z	melodie_	erUSUL	is THAT possible ?
2010-03-12T23:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	melodie_	could be ... which ones ?
2010-03-12T23:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	melodie_	so the intel driver it is
2010-03-12T23:36:00.000Z	melodie_	erUSUL	nope
2010-03-14T02:01:00.000Z	melodie_	erUSUL	then the whole home directory ? or all the .gconf directory to ?
2010-03-14T02:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	melodie_	no only the gconf things that affect evolution
2010-03-14T02:02:00.000Z	melodie_	erUSUL	I have copied the files from there before from one machine to the others, without copying gconf and it was ok to import adresses and such
2010-03-14T02:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	melodie_	yes i do not doubt that ... just saying that the backup feature of evolution also saves the gconf configuration in addition to the ~/.evolution/ dir
2010-03-14T02:04:00.000Z	melodie_	erUSUL	so the evolution dir contains much more ?
2010-03-14T02:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	melodie_	i'm talking about the "File>Backup Settings" feature of evolution describing what it does. it tars up the evolution dir but also saves the gconf keys of evolution
2010-03-14T02:06:00.000Z	melodie_	erUSUL	so that's good ?
2010-03-14T02:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	melodie_	yes
