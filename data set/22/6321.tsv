2007-07-08T05:40:00.000Z	shwouchk		WTF?!?! I just sshed into my ubuntu box and I get a big list of : -bash: /dev/null: Permission denied PLEASE HELP!
2007-07-08T05:42:00.000Z	shwouchk		ok looks like Im finally getting off ubuntu's terrible terrible support and moving to debian
2007-07-08T05:43:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	shwouchk	did your problem statement somehow get missed in the flurry?
2007-07-08T05:45:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	shwouchk	I say again: did your problem statement somehow get missed in the flurry? maybe you could restate it
2007-07-08T05:46:00.000Z	shwouchk	Nutubuntu	I just sshed into my ubuntu box after a reboot and I get a big list of : -bash: /dev/null: Permission denied
2007-07-08T05:47:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	shwouchk	you're way above my head, but one suggestion - have you pastebinned the output? maybe someone who knows more about ssh and the necessary permissions on the host can look it over.
2007-07-08T05:48:00.000Z	shwouchk	Nutubuntu	theres nothing to pastebin - I just get this line multiple times
2007-07-08T05:48:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	shwouchk	I'm n00b enough that I don't know what you're expecting to see
2007-07-08T05:48:00.000Z	shwouchk	Nutubuntu	I see.. Im expecting to see a shell
2007-07-08T05:49:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	shwouchk	 I assume the target box has to run some daemon that accepts connections from ssh client?
2007-07-08T05:49:00.000Z	shwouchk	Nutubuntu	of course
2007-07-08T05:49:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	shwouchk	sorry, I know that sounds basic as can be ... you've checked that the thing *is* running?
2007-07-08T05:51:00.000Z	shwouchk	Nutubuntu	if it wouldnt be running, I wouldnt be able to give my user and pass...
2007-07-08T05:52:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	shwouchk	the default shell on the target box -- bash or dash?
2007-07-08T05:52:00.000Z	shwouchk	Nutubuntu	what the hell is dash?
2007-07-08T05:54:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	shwouchk	 dash is the default shell in, I think, Edgy and above -- sometimes it makes a difference, esp when some person or process expects bash instead
2007-07-08T05:55:00.000Z	shwouchk	Nutubuntu	well I never even heard of dast so I doubt thats what I had
2007-07-08T05:55:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	shwouchk	 is the target box running Ubuntu? if so which version?
2007-07-08T05:57:00.000Z	shwouchk	Nutubuntu	obviously, or I wouldnt be asking in #ubuntu... it's 7.04 - nm though - I managed to set 0666 permissions to /dev/null via webmin and it solved the problem
2007-07-08T05:58:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	shwouchk	 glad you resolved it - obviously.
2007-07-08T05:58:00.000Z	shwouchk	Nutubuntu	thanks..
2007-07-08T05:59:00.000Z	shwouchk	Nutubuntu	you too
