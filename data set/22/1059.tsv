2010-10-24T17:51:00.000Z	zode		yarrrght, can someone help me D:
2010-10-24T17:51:00.000Z	zode		whenever i plug ANYTHING to usb or boot this pc, cd drive opens and i was fine with that
2010-10-24T17:51:00.000Z	zode		BUT now when i plug my cam/usb stick it wont show up anywhere (not even desktop)
2010-10-24T17:52:00.000Z	garos	zode	try plugging your usb stick and running lsusb
2010-10-24T17:52:00.000Z	zode		k, lemme try that
2010-10-24T17:53:00.000Z	garos	zode	do other usb devices work?
2010-10-24T17:53:00.000Z	zode		Garos yes
2010-10-24T17:54:00.000Z	zode		my usb headphones work and Nokia BROADBAND connection works
2010-10-24T17:54:00.000Z	zode		and arduino works too
2010-10-24T17:54:00.000Z	garos		hmm
2010-10-24T17:54:00.000Z	garos		then your flash drive might just not mount automatically
2010-10-24T17:54:00.000Z	zode	garos	its probably because (i dont know how to mount also) i edited some rules file
2010-10-24T17:55:00.000Z	zode		from some guide to get nokia broadband work
2010-10-24T17:55:00.000Z	zode		BUT it was BEFORE i noticed networking HAD this settings thing for broadband -_-
2010-10-24T17:55:00.000Z	garos	zode	do a "ls /dev | grep sd"
2010-10-24T17:56:00.000Z	zode		now it outputted some random text
2010-10-24T17:56:00.000Z	zode		with sd written in red
2010-10-24T17:56:00.000Z	garos		ok
2010-10-24T17:57:00.000Z	zode		and a, a1, a2, a5, b, c, d on white
