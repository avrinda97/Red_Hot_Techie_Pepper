I own a small video store and would like to dup the orginals and rent out the backups so that when they get scratched i can destroy them and create new ones.  My customers would love this but aparently this is not legal?
2009-08-06T10:39:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	better to ask forgiveness than permission, just do it until someone sends you a letter
2009-08-06T10:40:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	fair use is always debatable, this is why we have lawyers and lobbiests
2009-08-06T10:41:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	if someone has a problem they will send you a cease and desist, and unless you are selling copies you'll have no problems beyond civil
2009-08-06T10:44:00.000Z	grendal_prime	innomen	im thinking companys like redbox must use a lisc schema like this.
2009-08-06T10:46:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	you're exploring fair use, fair use is always debatable
2009-08-06T10:46:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	if you're so worried maybe buy insurance instead of paying for backups?
2009-08-06T10:48:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	and then call the EFF, and then call the MPAA
2009-08-06T10:49:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	this is why they have intellectual property attorneys :)
2009-08-06T10:51:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	everyone will, building a business is about risk vs reward *shrugs*
2009-08-06T10:52:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	exactly
2009-08-06T10:52:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	you have plausible deniability
2009-08-06T10:52:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	 you are clearly not trying to infiringe
2009-08-06T10:54:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	keep in mind the cost of blanks + labor, ususally just mailing in dead ones for copies is better, as per blockbuster
2009-08-06T10:57:00.000Z	grendal_prime	innomen	 ya i dont know that i can mail these in.  Besides i much like the lightscribe look to the disks..otherwise we have to perm-marker our name onto the disks..sometimes its not easy to do.
2009-08-06T11:00:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	sounds good to me man, i dont think anyone will care, the big thing these days is streaming
2009-08-06T11:01:00.000Z	grendal_prime	innomen	the other thing is..(and this is  a bit grey area of course,) is that i could see us buying 5 copies of something and it turning out to be that we need 10...ok we run off 10 for the night and pick up 5 more in the morning.)  If i was to get audited that morning i would be screwed..but i just cant see anyone being that anal about that sort of stuff.
2009-08-06T11:03:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	that would be illegal definitely, you could argue it like anything else but i think you'd ahve to pay someone
2009-08-06T11:03:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	better off just telling them to come back later
2009-08-06T11:03:00.000Z	grendal_prime	innomen	ya i agree. its just i can see that sort of thing happening.
2009-08-06T11:03:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	well, then buy 10 up front :)
2009-08-06T11:04:00.000Z	innomen	grendal_prime	yea
