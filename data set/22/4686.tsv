2008-06-07T18:03:00.000Z	jrib	Ward1983_	xdpyinfo| grep 'depth of root'
2008-06-07T18:04:00.000Z	Ward1983_	jrib	my color dept...
2008-06-07T18:05:00.000Z	Ward1983_	jrib	what you sayd is not funny from my point of view, because im fed up with ubuntu for weeks, my system does nothing then crash and then i NEED to reboot, and nobody can help me
2008-06-07T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	Ward1983_	I answered your question... that is your color depth.
2008-06-07T18:05:00.000Z	Ward1983_	jrib	dont feel guilty though, i had allready decided to switch to debian when i have the time, right now i just want to do my schoolwork
2008-06-07T18:06:00.000Z	Ward1983_	jrib	why is is expressed in plqnes :s
2008-06-07T18:06:00.000Z	Ward1983_	jrib	sorry i thought you meant do let me do something funny
2008-06-07T18:07:00.000Z	jrib	Ward1983_	I don't know why it is expressed in planes
2008-06-07T18:07:00.000Z	Ward1983_	jrib	but 24plqnes == 24bit right?
2008-06-07T18:07:00.000Z	jrib	Ward1983_	yes
2008-06-07T18:07:00.000Z	Ward1983_	jrib	and can i try to set it to 32bit ?
2008-06-07T18:08:00.000Z	jrib	Ward1983_	see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#32-bit_color
2008-06-07T18:08:00.000Z	Ward1983_	jrib	thanx a lot :)
2008-06-07T18:09:00.000Z	Ward1983_	jrib	you haven't heard of funky gnome crashes by any chance? my system crashes randomly for weeks and i think its gnome, at least is seems like it
2008-06-07T18:10:00.000Z	jrib	Ward1983_	if they seem random, I'd run a memtest first.  Then I'd suspect binary video drivers if you are using them (try a different one)
2008-06-07T18:11:00.000Z	Ward1983_	jrib	memory is ok i allready tested that
2008-06-07T18:11:00.000Z	Ward1983_	jrib	im just using the normal nvidia driver thats in the repos :(
2008-06-07T18:11:00.000Z	jrib	Ward1983_	see if you get the crashes using nv
2008-06-07T18:12:00.000Z	Ward1983_	jrib	great idea!
