2006-06-03T07:43:00.000Z	Frogzoo	LaRevolucion	usually it's just a question of changing the mouse protocol in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-06-03T07:44:00.000Z	LaRevolucion	Frogzoo	?
2006-06-03T07:45:00.000Z	Frogzoo	LaRevolucion	under mouse setting in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, there's a line "Option      "Protocol"  & also "Option      "Device" "/dev/input/mice"
2006-06-03T07:45:00.000Z	Frogzoo	LaRevolucion	try this, 'sudo cat /dev/input/mice'   now move the mouse - do you get any response? ie wierd characters?
