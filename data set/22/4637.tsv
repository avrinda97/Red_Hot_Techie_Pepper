2007-11-22T06:29:00.000Z	bradv	UbuntMe	Go to ##windows
2007-11-22T06:48:00.000Z	bradv	UbuntMe	Have you checked the settings in your Bios? Your problem appears to have nothing to do at all with Ubuntu
2007-11-22T06:51:00.000Z	bradv	UbuntMe	Please listen to everyone that's trying to help. If you don't understand the directions please say something, don't just keep asking the same thing.
2007-11-22T06:54:00.000Z	bradv	UbuntMe	BIOS stands for basic input and output system. It is what starts your computer. Reboot, and when you see the very first splash screen, press Delete.
2007-11-22T06:55:00.000Z	bradv	UbuntMe	But I suggest you read the manual that came with your motherboard first.
2007-11-22T06:58:00.000Z	bradv	UbuntMe	That's too late already. Press Delete about 5 seconds before that.
2007-11-22T07:14:00.000Z	bradv	UbuntMe	Your problem relates to the configuration of your BIOS. Call Lenovo tech support for help.

2007-11-22T07:15:00.000Z	bradv	UbuntMe	We have given you the instructions. I'm not sure you have followed them. But we're volunteers. Lenovo has professionals.
