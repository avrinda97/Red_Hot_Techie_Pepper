2009-09-23T16:54:00.000Z	dox		How do you get X to launch an app in the screen it was launched rather than screen 0 ?
2009-09-23T16:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dox	 DISPLAY=X.X  commandtorun
2009-09-23T16:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dox	 a program looks at the DISPLAY variable to see where to launch.. some have a SCREEN/Display option/configs tehy may read.. but not  all/many
2009-09-23T16:56:00.000Z	dox	Dr_Willis	Hmm, it's amazing how un-useable dual-monitors is proving to be!
2009-09-23T16:56:00.000Z	dox	Dr_Willis	But thank you.
2009-09-23T16:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dox	 i have no issues with dual monitors. :) but i do use Twinview - I dont see any reason to run 2 X servers.
2009-09-23T16:57:00.000Z	dox	Dr_Willis	TwinView is fine, EXCEPT that it spans the wallpaper
2009-09-23T16:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dox	 actually..  I just make extra wide custome wallpaper...
2009-09-23T16:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dox	 you are doing a lot of work for fancy wallpaper...
2009-09-23T16:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dox	 neitehr are mine.. so i customiuzed the wallpaper.. it wasent hard
2009-09-23T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dox	 perhaps ya should just quit twiddling with things and use a solid color..
2009-09-23T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dox	 actually I think KDE let me set different wallpapers on each monitor..
2009-09-23T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dox	 im pretty SURE kde4 let me do that.
2009-09-23T16:59:00.000Z	dox	Dr_Willis	Yeah it crossed my mind but changing WM to achieve that seems extreme :)
2009-09-23T16:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dox	  worrying about wallpaper seems extreme to me.
2009-09-23T16:59:00.000Z	dox	Dr_Willis	When you spend as much time in front of the computer as I do, a plain blue background gets old real quick
2009-09-23T17:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dox	 i alwo recall that Google app Picassa (i think) could do 'collages'  the size of your current desktop :) it makes some nice wallpapers.
2009-09-23T17:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dox	 learn to maxamize your working apps. :)
2009-09-23T17:00:00.000Z	dox	Dr_Willis	:)
2009-09-23T17:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dox	 write an app that  resizes/joins the 2 images.. and sets the wallpaper.. that shouldent be too hard to do. :)
2009-09-23T17:01:00.000Z	dox	Dr_Willis	I'm more likely to just buy a new monitor tbh :)
2009-09-23T17:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dox	 heres my gimp template for my 'wallpaper' background   i normally play with  http://drop.io/gx1kiao
