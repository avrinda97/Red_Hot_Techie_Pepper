2005-09-22T13:27:00.000Z	gr3g1	bob2	can i pm?
2005-09-22T13:28:00.000Z	bob2	gr3g1	no
2005-09-22T13:28:00.000Z	bob2	gr3g1	that's a command to run
2005-09-22T13:29:00.000Z	bob2	gr3g1	then use update-rc.d to install it into the runlevels
2005-09-22T13:31:00.000Z	gr3g1	bob2	there is no update-rc files in /etc/init.d
2005-09-22T13:31:00.000Z	bob2	gr3g1	indeed, I said update-rc.d, and it's a command, not a file in that dir
2005-09-22T13:36:00.000Z	gr3g1	bob2	i did update-rc.d res.sh defaults
2005-09-22T13:38:00.000Z	bob2	gr3g1	did you read the hel pfor how update-rc.d works?
2005-09-22T13:39:00.000Z	gr3g1	bob2	yes, but it still didnt load
2005-09-22T13:40:00.000Z	bob2	gr3g1	is it listed in /etc/rc2.d?
2005-09-22T13:42:00.000Z	gr3g1	bob2	tes it is
2005-09-22T13:42:00.000Z	gr3g1	bob2	yes***
2005-09-22T13:43:00.000Z	bob2	gr3g1	then it will run on boot
2005-09-22T13:44:00.000Z	bob2	gr3g1	what is the name of it in /etc/rc2.d?
2005-09-22T13:44:00.000Z	gr3g1	bob2	S20res.sh
2005-09-22T13:45:00.000Z	bob2	gr3g1	and the scritp runs properly when run as 'sudo /etc/init.d/res.sh start'?
2005-09-22T13:46:00.000Z	gr3g1	bob2	yup
2005-09-22T13:51:00.000Z	gr3g1	bob2	is there any other way?
