2008-03-29T08:56:00.000Z	levander		Nobody knows why even though I have auto-installing security updates configured, that every time I login, that little notification thing in the upper right is always telling me I have updates available?
2008-03-29T08:57:00.000Z	soldats	levander	when you click the icon does it give you updates
2008-03-29T08:58:00.000Z	levander	soldats	Yeah, when I click the icon, the dialog pops up and tells me what updates are available.
2008-03-29T09:00:00.000Z	levander	soldats	I just looked, it does say "Important security updates" at the top of the list of updates.  So, I imagine they are secuirty updates?
2008-03-29T09:00:00.000Z	soldats	levander	yes id think so
2008-03-29T09:01:00.000Z	levander	soldats	In "Software Sources" I clicked on "Install security updates without confirmation."  Why is that not auto-installing all these security updates?
2008-03-29T09:02:00.000Z	soldats	levander	no clue, are you runnin it with sudo. is this hardy by any chance?
2008-03-29T09:03:00.000Z	levander	soldats	no, gutsy.  And, I just get to the "Software Sources" dialog via the System->Administration menu.  So, I'm prompted for sudo passwd when it needs it...  So yeah, I'm running it with sudo.
2008-03-29T09:03:00.000Z	soldats	levander	hmm weird
2008-03-29T09:04:00.000Z	soldats	levander	no errors? have you checked? also are the repos in /etc/apt/sources.list un-commented?
2008-03-29T09:05:00.000Z	levander	soldats	I don't know where to check for errors since all that stuff runs in the background.  And yeah, the security repositories are definitely enabled in sources.list here.
2008-03-29T09:07:00.000Z	soldats	levander	strange, i had a person in my loco with a similar problem, im still looking into it. if possible i can get back to you on it. you may also try tomorrow when more users are around.
2008-03-29T09:12:00.000Z	soldats	levander	its possible with other window manager but for GNOME im not sure. enlightenment has it
2008-03-29T09:15:00.000Z	soldats	levander	its the "win" key
2008-03-29T09:16:00.000Z	levander	soldats	It's not on this keyboard.
2008-03-29T09:16:00.000Z	levander	soldats	No, it's one of those old buckling spring IBM keyboards.  They don't make keyboards like this anymore.
2008-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	soldats	levander	the super key is not necessarily windows its a "super" key or meta4 key
2008-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	levander	soldats	Where is the meta4 key on my keyboard?
2008-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	soldats	levander	se big-boss_ post youll rebind them
2008-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	soldats	levander	the meta4 is the win/super key. see above
2008-03-29T09:18:00.000Z	levander	soldats	I already told you, I don't have one of those.
2008-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	soldats	levander	yea see big-boss_
