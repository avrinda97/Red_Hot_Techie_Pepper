2008-09-21T02:23:00.000Z	wiehan		Do you people realise that I've NEVER EVER had a question answered in this channel!!! And it's been at least 50 questions and counting
2008-09-21T02:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiehan	Do you have a question now? Maybe you can get a new record of 51 unanswered questions :)
2008-09-21T02:25:00.000Z	wiehan	Jordan_U	what is the answer to life?
2008-09-21T02:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiehan	Dude, even google knows that: http://www.google.com/search?q=answer+to+life%2C+the+universe%2C+and+everything
2012-11-04T15:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiehan	Where did you tell the installer to install grub's boot sector, did Ubuntu's installer give any error messages, and what is the exact error message from grub?
2012-11-04T15:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiehan	They can all be btrfs, but understand that btrfs is still experimental and if you want a stable reliable system it's probably not worth it to use btrfs yet.
2012-11-04T15:54:00.000Z	wiehan	Jordan_U	I can't remember the exact error messages: The first time it 'booted' to a grub recovery console after an uncertain error message about cannot find drive with uuid awe123uie123 (or something alike) and the second time it was just "cannot find drive, please insert drive" - ubuntu installer gave no problems
2012-11-04T15:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiehan	grub never asks to insert a drive, so that must have been something else printing that error.
2012-11-04T15:56:00.000Z	wiehan	Jordan_U	yeah I know, it must have been a problem with the MBR and the ?bios printed that last one? I don't know
2012-11-04T15:58:00.000Z	wiehan	Jordan_U	bekks let's simplify this: something went wrong with the following choices: sda1 /home  btrfs, sdb1 / btrfs; MBR on sda... why did this not work?
2012-11-04T15:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiehan	I would need to know the exact error messages from grub, and probably also see boot info script output, to tell you.
2012-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	wiehan	Jordan_U	the one I got most of the time was: Cannot find device with UUID xxxxxx then next line: grub>
2012-11-04T16:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiehan	What version of Ubuntu did you try to install?
2012-11-04T16:02:00.000Z	wiehan	Jordan_U	isn't it that / may be btrfs but /boot must still be ext4
2012-11-04T16:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiehan	grub has full support for btrfs, including /boot/.
2012-11-04T16:03:00.000Z	wiehan	Jordan_U	should the MBR be on sda or sda1?
2012-11-04T16:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiehan	definitely sda.
2012-11-04T16:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiehan	Well, sda or sdb, but certainly not a partition like sda1 or sdb1.
2012-11-04T16:04:00.000Z	wiehan	Jordan_U	and for some reason the advanced partitioning tool left 1mb free space before the sda1 partition (this cannot be avoided)
2012-11-04T16:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiehan	That's because aligning to MiB boundaries is the right thing to do for performance reasons.
2012-11-04T16:06:00.000Z	wiehan	Jordan_U	thanks I am learning a lot now; One more thing: what fs is the "best" for use on a ssd?
2012-11-04T16:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wiehan	Right now, for most use cases, probably ext4.
