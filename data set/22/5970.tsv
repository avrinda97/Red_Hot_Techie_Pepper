2007-02-22T13:46:00.000Z	kane77		ehm.. a basic question.. How do I "cd" into a directory that has spaces in name?
2007-02-22T13:47:00.000Z	Pici	kane77	escape the spaces with \
2007-04-17T06:47:00.000Z	Pici	kane77	Yes.
2007-11-19T19:03:00.000Z	kane77	Pici	is it the same if I want to recover after installing gentoo??
2007-11-19T19:03:00.000Z	Pici	kane77	Should be pretty similar.
2007-11-28T20:39:00.000Z	Pici	kane77	no, it is limted to ~4gb
2007-11-28T20:39:00.000Z	Pici	kane77	shift-ctrl-c
2007-11-28T20:40:00.000Z	Pici	kane77	And even then there are certain paramters can can be set when the kernel is compiled to allow more than 4gb.  The Ubuntu -server kernel has this support.
2007-11-29T01:12:00.000Z	kane77	Pici	who do I need to contact in terms of channels? like so far #ubuntu-sk forwards to #ubuntu-cz and if I wanted the #ubuntu-sk channel
2007-11-29T01:13:00.000Z	Pici	kane77	can you ask about it in #ubuntu-ops? I'm not sure what the policy is right now, and I'm a bit too busy to hunt it down
2007-11-29T01:14:00.000Z	kane77	Pici	ok.. thanx...
2007-11-29T23:48:00.000Z	Pici	kane77	from /proc/loadavg
2007-11-29T23:49:00.000Z	kane77	Pici	what are the 4th and 5th number?
2007-11-29T23:50:00.000Z	Pici	kane77	read man proc
2008-02-18T22:20:00.000Z	Pici	kane77	if its running, use: netstat -tanp | grep programname
2008-02-18T22:23:00.000Z	Pici	kane77	No problem
2008-08-08T18:17:00.000Z	Pici	kane77	You can look at the build logs for the packages.. let me get you a link, hold on.
