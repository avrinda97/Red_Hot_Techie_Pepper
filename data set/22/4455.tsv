2008-01-08T11:33:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Darkmystere	sounds like it takes you back to a fresh xorg.conf then right?

2008-01-13T09:16:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Darkmystere	why dont you apt-cache search usplash and install one??
2008-01-13T09:16:00.000Z	Darkmystere	hunchybunch	Nope its a Graphical Installl
2008-01-13T09:17:00.000Z	Darkmystere	hunchybunch	i already have Usplash theme ready to be used and i have startupmanager... so im kinda lost
2008-01-13T09:18:00.000Z	Darkmystere	hunchybunch	And im pretty sure...That Usplash is Installed..
2008-01-13T09:18:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Darkmystere	is your theme installed?
2008-01-13T09:19:00.000Z	Darkmystere	hunchybunch	Yep The Default 1 doesnt even work..
2008-01-13T09:20:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Darkmystere	must be something with your video card and vesa mode possibly
2008-01-13T09:21:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Darkmystere	even when you boot up using the cd?
2008-01-13T09:21:00.000Z	Darkmystere	hunchybunch	well it works in livecd and it worked when i first was starting the install with Wubi
2008-01-13T09:23:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Darkmystere	i use an old ati card also and have not had that issue, other than screwing it up by installing stuff, and even at that i was able to get it back.
2008-01-13T09:26:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Darkmystere	yea that is weird, for some reason grub isn't able to load it it sounds like
2008-01-13T09:29:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Darkmystere	you didn't  bork grub or set permissions to initrd whereas it couldn't update it did you ?
