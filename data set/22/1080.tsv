2011-11-09T04:31:00.000Z	jhjh		which conclusion
2011-11-09T04:32:00.000Z	jhjh		no I cannot, that kernel is alone
2011-11-09T04:32:00.000Z	jhjh		idiotic dmesg log even has no date or time
2011-11-09T04:33:00.000Z	jhjh		i pasted exactly what I installed
2011-11-09T04:33:00.000Z	jhjh		DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 11.10"
2011-11-09T04:34:00.000Z	jhjh		maybe I should pass some proprietary parameters to kernel to stop it from segfaulting?
2011-11-09T04:35:00.000Z	jhjh		real linux can boot bare, apparently proprietary ubuntuTMR cannot
2011-11-09T04:37:00.000Z	jhjh		i want to know PROPRIETARY kernel parameters to make ubuntuTM to BOOT without SEGFAULTS in init!
2011-11-09T04:38:00.000Z	jhjh		i have free grub 0.97, not some proprieatary ubuntu junk
2011-11-09T04:38:00.000Z	jhjh		sorry
2011-11-09T04:39:00.000Z	yagoo	jhjh	yuck
2011-11-09T04:40:00.000Z	yagoo	jhjh	your kernel is f'ed
2011-11-09T04:40:00.000Z	yagoo	jhjh	you needed to apply the ubuntu diffs/patches against any vanilla kernel
2011-11-09T04:41:00.000Z	yagoo	jhjh	you mean chocolate or modded.. i wouldn't call it proprietary
2011-11-09T05:31:00.000Z	yagoo	jhjh	you can't compile kernels. you're toooo new at it.. you should toy around with kernel compilation in a virtualbox
2011-11-09T05:32:00.000Z	jhjh	yagoo	compile kernels wtf you're talking about?
2011-11-09T05:38:00.000Z	yagoo	jhjh	if you get kernel crashes then you really have to google your hardware+ubuntu online.. cuse we can't really help ya without you knowing your hardware insideout
2011-11-09T06:21:00.000Z	yagoo	jhjh	there is real support. It's called google. Go google it.
2011-11-09T06:22:00.000Z	yagoo	jhjh	come back tomorrow, i'll boil a bit of coffee overnight
2011-11-09T06:24:00.000Z	yagoo	jhjh	the problem is not fstab, the problem is you.
2011-11-09T06:34:00.000Z	yagoo	jhjh	did you call santa claus? Cuse i heard he uses ubuntu.
2011-11-09T06:40:00.000Z	yagoo	jhjh	i see alot of other people progressing here. For the whole time you've been whining you could of restored your broken system.
