2007-03-22T16:15:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	I don't think you do =/
2007-03-22T16:16:00.000Z	Moniker42	Slart	no =(
2007-03-22T16:16:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	at least I've never seen a pdf-editor for linux
2007-03-22T16:16:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	a pdf in general isn't that easy to edit..
2007-03-22T16:18:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	ah.. ok.. yes.. that's a pdf editor.. but it wont work like your average word-processor
2007-03-22T16:19:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	LordLimecat: I think it's pseudo editor because you can add or change little parts.. you can't for example add a word to a line anc expect it to change linebreaks etc
2007-03-22T16:19:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	that it might do
2007-03-22T16:21:00.000Z	Moniker42	Slart	it doesn't appear to be working =(
2007-03-22T16:21:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	oh? some kind of error? or it just didn't do what you wanted?
2007-03-22T16:22:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	hmm.. I'll give it a try.. what was the package called?
2007-03-22T16:22:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	installing.. brb
2007-03-22T16:24:00.000Z	Moniker42	Slart	looks like there's a thread on the forums for editing pdfs that's been ongoing since the middle of 2005
2007-03-22T16:24:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	long long threads.. I'm just about to try it
2007-03-22T16:26:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	worked fine here.. I could open, edit, save ..
2007-03-22T16:30:00.000Z	Moniker42	Slart	well...
2007-03-22T16:30:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	was it all you've dreams it would be? =)
2007-03-22T16:31:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	the gimp opens pdf's.. but only the first page.. and as a image
2007-03-22T16:32:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	I'm almost starting to think gimp is the best pdf editor out there =)
2007-03-22T16:35:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	ah... didn't know that
2008-01-04T12:27:00.000Z	Moniker42	Slart	with wobbly windows and fire writing? :)
2008-01-04T12:28:00.000Z	Slart	Moniker42	ok.. I didn't max it.. but still =)
