2007-09-29T09:52:00.000Z	Rainarrow		Hello guys, how do I share files between two Ubuntu box? I have a LAN up already
2007-09-29T09:52:00.000Z	Rainarrow		I know I could share files with a Windows box with Samba
2007-09-29T09:54:00.000Z	Rainarrow		Hey guys?
2007-09-29T09:54:00.000Z	Rainarrow		Hi Veggie
2007-09-29T09:55:00.000Z	Rainarrow		ah, I means, did samba also works between 2 linux boxes? I know I could share files between a Linux box and a Windows one using samba
2007-09-29T09:56:00.000Z	Rainarrow		OK, thanks
2007-09-29T09:58:00.000Z	Rainarrow		Another question, just to be curious, what is the numbers before every line of message showed during startup?
2007-09-29T09:58:00.000Z	Rainarrow		I know it should be some kind of timing
2007-09-29T09:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rainarrow	time in seconds from boot
2007-09-29T09:59:00.000Z	Rainarrow	erUSUL	is it really in seconds?
2007-09-29T09:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rainarrow	afaics yes
2007-09-29T09:59:00.000Z	Rainarrow	erUSUL	sometimes I get something like [33.125000]  followed by [2.175000] 
2007-09-29T09:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rainarrow	your are refering to the msgs you can inspect with dmesg ?
2007-09-29T10:00:00.000Z	Rainarrow	erUSUL	yes, they also show up while booting without the quite option
2007-09-29T10:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rainarrow	mines are secuential and i do know for sure that they are timestamps
2007-09-29T10:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rainarrow	i compile my own kernels and there is a config option to turn them on/off
2007-09-29T10:01:00.000Z	Rainarrow	erUSUL	ok thanks, in fact it's booting with a LiveCD when I noticed they are not constantly increasing
2007-09-29T10:02:00.000Z	Rainarrow	erUSUL	however when booting from HDD it's sequential
2007-09-29T10:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rainarrow	dunno what can couse this behavior... maybe a timer related bug
2007-09-29T10:02:00.000Z	Rainarrow	erUSUL	ok thanks, and it's in seconds right?
2007-09-29T10:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rainarrow	afaics yes
2008-05-11T20:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rainarrow	that only restarts the *user* X session
