2010-11-17T00:26:00.000Z	goltoof	Pici	i said simple
2010-11-17T00:26:00.000Z	goltoof	Pici	  there was another that showed only a couple, not all, i'd like to tell what size they are too
2010-11-25T00:29:00.000Z	Pici	goltoof	please stop.
2010-11-25T00:29:00.000Z	goltoof	Pici	 sorry.. just had to be sure
2011-02-11T20:31:00.000Z	Pici	goltoof	Because your user doesn't have the rights to access some paths.  You can use find /whatever 2>/dev/null to suppress those errors.
2011-02-11T22:00:00.000Z	Pici	goltoof	If you're just looking for a cli screenshot tool, check out scrot.
2011-02-11T22:03:00.000Z	Pici	goltoof	Have you looked at the manpage for 'import', it describes how to save the image in another file format.
2011-02-11T22:03:00.000Z	goltoof	Pici	 oh, so that's the problem? didn't think of that, lol
2011-02-11T22:06:00.000Z	goltoof	Pici	 not seeing an option to select a portion of the screen with scrot, i can select a whole window, etc, but not like import
2011-02-11T22:08:00.000Z	goltoof	Pici	 nevermind, i can select a portion with scrot.. and i don't get errors in gimp.  thanks mate!
2011-02-11T22:10:00.000Z	goltoof	Pici	sacarlson  i've always had issues with png/gimp using import, but works fine with scrot
2011-07-07T19:40:00.000Z	goltoof	Pici	 did i mess up?  it can be reinstalled yes?
2011-07-07T19:41:00.000Z	Pici	goltoof	removing nautilus will force the removal of a number of core gnome packages that depend on it.
2011-07-07T19:41:00.000Z	goltoof	Pici	 I've done it before with no problems
2011-10-13T22:32:00.000Z	Pici	goltoof	sebsebseb, BluesKaj, other helpers that I don't see at the moment: I've added !gnome2, which might be helpful, feel free to use or make a suggestion to the bot if you think it needs to be cleaned up.
