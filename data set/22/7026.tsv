2006-06-10T08:52:00.000Z	kieranDOA		Is anyone familiar with configuring X on ubuntu PPC?
2006-06-10T08:53:00.000Z	spikeb	kieranDOA	should be simple - you'll either have ati or nvidia for video
2006-06-10T08:53:00.000Z	kieranDOA	spikeb	Yes, i do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and it errors "no screens detected" and i have to restore my x conf
2006-06-10T08:54:00.000Z	spikeb	kieranDOA	that's odd
2006-06-10T08:54:00.000Z	spikeb	kieranDOA	you could look up the exact info for your machine (if it has a built in display) online
2006-06-10T08:56:00.000Z	spikeb	kieranDOA	what machine are you having problems on?
2006-06-10T08:57:00.000Z	kieranDOA	spikeb	its an eMac
2006-06-10T08:57:00.000Z	spikeb	kieranDOA	look up the exact specs online, then you can enter it by hand into xorg.conf
2006-06-10T08:57:00.000Z	kieranDOA	spikeb	ive fed all of the display info into X
2006-06-10T08:57:00.000Z	spikeb	kieranDOA	and it's still being retarded?
2006-06-10T08:57:00.000Z	kieranDOA	spikeb	Yep.
2006-06-10T08:58:00.000Z	kieranDOA	spikeb	The config i have now is ok, apart from the lack of any resolution other than 1024*768
2006-06-10T08:59:00.000Z	spikeb	kieranDOA	emacs max out at 1024x768 dont they?
2006-06-10T09:05:00.000Z	kieranDOA	spikeb	You think if i copied my X config from os x to ubuntu itd work?
2006-06-10T09:05:00.000Z	spikeb	kieranDOA	i never tried that myself
2006-06-10T09:06:00.000Z	spikeb	kieranDOA	back up your working config and try it
2006-06-10T09:06:00.000Z	kieranDOA	spikeb	already done that, from thr countless attemps at dpkg-reconfigure
2006-06-10T09:06:00.000Z	spikeb	kieranDOA	haha
2006-06-10T09:07:00.000Z	spikeb	kieranDOA	osx uses xfree 4.4, not xorg
2006-06-10T09:08:00.000Z	kieranDOA	spikeb	the config file should still work though shouldnt it?>
2006-06-10T09:08:00.000Z	spikeb	kieranDOA	i think so
2006-06-10T09:09:00.000Z	spikeb	kieranDOA	yes you can mount it read only very easily
