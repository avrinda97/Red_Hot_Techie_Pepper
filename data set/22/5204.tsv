2008-06-23T11:46:00.000Z	nubuntu		i just type lspci into term?
2008-06-23T11:46:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	nubuntu	yep.
2008-06-23T11:51:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	nubuntu	alt+F2, then type xterm in the little box an voila! you have a terminal.
2008-06-23T11:55:00.000Z	nubuntu	saint-takeshi	thank you, have terminal now.
2008-06-23T12:25:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	nubuntu	now that i think about it, that happened to me once.
2008-06-23T12:26:00.000Z	nubuntu	saint-takeshi	its driving me crazy
2008-06-23T12:26:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	nubuntu	try invoking gnome-panel from terminal?
2008-06-23T12:26:00.000Z	nubuntu	saint-takeshi	um, so, do you remember what the fix was?
2008-06-23T12:27:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	nubuntu	i think i just cried and banged my head off the monitor until i could be bothered reinstalling from scratch, to ne honest....that's my usual trick.
2008-06-23T12:29:00.000Z	nubuntu	saint-takeshi	this IS a fresh install!!! :(
2008-06-23T12:29:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	nubuntu	(tip: it's shift+insert to paste into terminal)
2008-06-23T12:30:00.000Z	nubuntu	saint-takeshi	ok, i try after i reopen term
2008-06-23T12:30:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	nubuntu	you remember how to do that, yeah?
2008-06-23T12:32:00.000Z	nubuntu	saint-takeshi	i like that trick.... and slart, said i don't have gnome panel installed and to sudo apt-get it, in process now
2008-06-23T12:34:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	nubuntu	that's weird...you update your video driver and it removes gnome-panel?
2008-06-23T12:36:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	nubuntu	you shouldn't have to restart. just log out and back in should do it (or ctrl-alt-backspace, if you're feeling quirky)
2008-06-23T12:44:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	nubuntu	still no panel?
2008-06-23T12:48:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	nubuntu	that's just to close the terminal. the "&" means keep the command alive after the parent process (xterm) is closed
2008-06-23T12:51:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	nubuntu	i think your computer might just hate you...did you sleep with its girlfriend or something?
2008-06-23T12:53:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	nubuntu	oh...when gnome-panel get removed, all the applets'll have gone, too, because they depend on the pane.
2008-06-23T12:54:00.000Z	nubuntu	saint-takeshi	so does that mean i have them, or i don't have them?
2008-06-23T12:56:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	nubuntu	check in synaptic whether they're installed. if anyone needs me in the next 15-20 minutes, contact my ISP, claim to be the police, give them my IP, they'll give you my home phone number...or just leave me a PM
