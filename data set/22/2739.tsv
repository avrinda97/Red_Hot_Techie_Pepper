2009-09-11T15:47:00.000Z	daasdingo		hey guys, I have an external hard disk and want to use it on both linux and windows systems, what filesystem should i use? ntfs always made problems when windows users unsecurely removed it, and fat32 has 4gb limit, and ext3/4 cannot be read by the stupid windows, does anyone know a good fle system?
2009-09-11T15:48:00.000Z	daasdingo		but I have movies which are over 4gb, thats the problem
2009-09-11T15:48:00.000Z	daasdingo		hm
2009-09-11T15:49:00.000Z	daasdingo		yes, I dont like it either
2009-09-11T15:49:00.000Z	daasdingo		but in school people want to plug it in for file sharing etc
2009-09-11T15:50:00.000Z	daasdingo		its an external hard disk, and in school we have both linux and windows systems so we always have problems with that
2009-09-11T15:50:00.000Z	daasdingo		well, i suppose thats the best solution, yes
2009-09-11T15:51:00.000Z	daasdingo		I dont know much about windows, can it only read fat and ntfs?
2009-09-11T15:53:00.000Z	daasdingo		I need it transportable, we have no network connection between pcs
2009-09-11T15:53:00.000Z	Amaranth	daasdingo	ntfs is your best choice
2009-09-11T15:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	daasdingo	linux can't fix fat32, if it needs to be checked for errors it needs to be checked for errors
2009-09-11T15:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	daasdingo	with fat32 you're just ignoring the errors
2009-09-11T15:58:00.000Z	daasdingo	Amaranth	well, but who cares about the dirty bit, normally it works ok
2009-09-11T16:03:00.000Z	daasdingo	Amaranth	nobody wants compiz
2009-09-11T16:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	daasdingo	I do
2009-09-11T16:04:00.000Z	daasdingo	Amaranth	it only makes problems with 3d apss
2009-09-11T16:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	daasdingo	But I may be a bit biased, I'm a compiz developer and somewhat responsible for it in ubuntu :P
2009-09-11T16:05:00.000Z	Amaranth	daasdingo	Not with nvidia and (at least in karmic) intel
2009-09-11T16:05:00.000Z	daasdingo	Amaranth	kk ;-)
2009-09-11T16:05:00.000Z	daasdingo	Amaranth	wine games have never worked with compiz at my system with nvidia
2009-09-11T16:07:00.000Z	daasdingo	Amaranth	I dont know about the state of compiz know, but a year ago with nvidia normal 3d apss didnt work either i think
2009-09-11T16:08:00.000Z	daasdingo	Amaranth	at least opengl stuff didn't start
