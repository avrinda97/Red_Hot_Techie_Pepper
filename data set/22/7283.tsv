2006-05-05T11:48:00.000Z	crunchyfish		i've been trying to install ubuntu for three days now :(
2006-05-05T11:49:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	oh, you can get help here
2006-05-05T11:50:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	after it freezes, can you reboot the new installation from hard drive?
2006-05-05T11:53:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	could be some filesystem problem, did you try another file system?
2006-05-05T11:53:00.000Z	crunchyfish	dli	do you mean other than ext3? i've just been letting the installer autopartition and format a blank space on my drive
2006-05-05T11:54:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	it happens sometimes, I suggest you to manually (or semi-manually) part the disk, and choose jfs/reiserfs instead of ext3
2006-05-05T11:55:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	not sure whether it would work, but it worth a try
2006-05-05T12:14:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	good :)
2006-05-05T12:14:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	did you change the partitioning also?
2006-05-05T12:18:00.000Z	crunchyfish	dli	it's still installing but it's gone further than it ever has before
2006-05-05T12:19:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	it's possible, it's a software bug, but also possible you need to check badblocks with your hdd
2006-05-05T12:20:00.000Z	crunchyfish	dli	it was actually doing this on a different drive i had in this same pc
2006-05-05T12:20:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	and ext3 doesn't on either drive?
2006-05-05T12:21:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	must be a software bug then
2006-05-05T12:21:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	I hate ext3, as much as I hate reiserfs :) I recommend jfs and reiser4
2006-05-06T11:02:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	still no luck?
2006-05-06T11:03:00.000Z	crunchyfish	dli	still no luck :( I even tried booting the Dapper LiveCD and it crashes as soon as the desktop shows up
2006-05-06T11:03:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	can you install gentoo? since you are already familiar to the step by step way of ubuntu
2006-05-06T11:03:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	it's a good way to debug
2006-05-06T11:04:00.000Z	crunchyfish	dli	I haven't tried that
2006-05-06T11:04:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	if something wrong with ubuntu installer, it's hard to tell the cause
2006-05-06T11:05:00.000Z	dli	crunchyfish	if you have another computer there, just use it to read the gentoo handbook
