2006-01-20T12:21:00.000Z	Zonkle		there is an error shows up when i open it
2006-01-20T12:21:00.000Z	Zonkle		can i give u a link to the image of the error in the forums ?
2006-01-20T12:22:00.000Z	Seveas	Zonkle	look at the topic of the channel
2006-01-20T12:22:00.000Z	Zonkle	Seveas	, sorry I didn't get what u mean
2006-01-20T12:23:00.000Z	Seveas	Zonkle	then read the topic again...
2006-01-20T12:25:00.000Z	Zonkle	Seveas	did you take a look ?
2006-01-20T12:28:00.000Z	Seveas	Zonkle	hit the reload button in syanptic or do apt-get update. If that gives other errors: pastebin them
2006-01-20T12:30:00.000Z	Zonkle	Seveas	I did reload them many times .... and they look fine, but after I close Synaptic and open it few times ,, it gets messed up again
2006-01-20T12:30:00.000Z	Seveas	Zonkle	then just hit reload again
2006-01-20T12:47:00.000Z	Seveas	Zonkle	is your network connection often down?
2006-01-20T12:47:00.000Z	Seveas	Zonkle	then that's it - known bug in the update manager: it removes all those lists when it attempts to update them. If the network connection is down - then there will be no new lists
2006-01-20T12:49:00.000Z	Seveas	Zonkle	no, but the auto-updater does that
2006-01-20T12:49:00.000Z	Seveas	Zonkle	trans_err do NOT use automatix!
2006-01-20T12:49:00.000Z	Seveas	Zonkle	yes
2006-01-20T12:50:00.000Z	Seveas	Zonkle	ubotu just said it
2006-01-20T12:50:00.000Z	Seveas	Zonkle	not. Just reload the lists when this happens...
2006-01-20T12:51:00.000Z	Seveas	Zonkle	breezy will have no new verions, only security updates
2006-01-20T12:57:00.000Z	Seveas	Zonkle	no
