2012-02-19T12:49:00.000Z	dRounse		if i decide to put an htpc on the other side of the room, connected to my server thru my switch with gbit, if i use a wallplate which would consist of three ethernet cables in total slow down my conection more than if i used one etheert cable
2012-02-19T12:50:00.000Z	dRounse		oh ok
2012-02-19T12:51:00.000Z	dRounse		well im thinking of gettin cat6 and its only for movies and media
2012-02-19T12:53:00.000Z	dRounse		ok im thinking ill just go with one long cable, cat6 is getting cheap, and no itll be 25-50ft of cable
2012-02-19T12:54:00.000Z	eggzeck	dRounse	Keep in mind cat6 doesn't determine everything.
2012-02-19T12:55:00.000Z	dRounse	eggzeck	i know but everything im using supports gbit so why not try cat6
2012-02-19T12:55:00.000Z	eggzeck	dRounse	No reason not to try cat6 :-)
2012-02-19T12:56:00.000Z	eggzeck	dRounse	But as Ben64 says they're more expensive and you WON'T notice much of a difference at all (not a significant one at least)
2012-02-19T12:57:00.000Z	eggzeck	dRounse	However I would use cat 5e instead of cat5 but cat5 is fine.
2012-02-19T12:58:00.000Z	eggzeck	dRounse	geeze, what kind of operation are you running in your home? lol
2012-02-19T13:00:00.000Z	dRounse	eggzeck	DrDnar, well just music and movies and docs but i setup a GoFlex home NAS for my family and say that some people use it to back up raid configs i just didnt know if it was worth it to do that
2012-02-19T13:25:00.000Z	dRounse	eggzeck	youre trying to mess him up lol
2012-02-19T13:25:00.000Z	eggzeck	dRounse	And why not use vi?
2012-02-19T13:25:00.000Z	dRounse	eggzeck	hes brandnew and wants something like notepad
2012-02-19T13:27:00.000Z	eggzeck	dRounse	Well actually nano would be easier to use than vi (vim) would be
2012-02-19T13:36:00.000Z	eggzeck	dRounse	That's not racism lol
2012-02-19T13:36:00.000Z	dRounse	eggzeck	sure it is :)
2012-02-19T13:37:00.000Z	eggzeck	dRounse	Oh, I didn't realize Ubuntu was a race (or any other distro) :-)
2012-02-19T13:37:00.000Z	dRounse	eggzeck	it is lol see you learn something new everyday
2012-02-19T13:38:00.000Z	dRounse	eggzeck	i think ubuntu is the crazy white racist southerners
2012-02-19T13:42:00.000Z	eggzeck	dRounse	If anyone thinks Ubuntu is too hard then I DO NOT recommend any other linux distro :-)
2012-02-19T13:43:00.000Z	dRounse	eggzeck	i know but i think "the distro named after a plant" is easier
