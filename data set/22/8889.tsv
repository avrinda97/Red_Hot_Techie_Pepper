2006-03-06T11:09:00.000Z	Absenth		ssh > vnc :)
2006-03-06T11:09:00.000Z	Absenth		but you're right,  VNC is very easy on windows.
2006-03-06T11:10:00.000Z	Absenth		bah.
2006-03-06T11:10:00.000Z	Absenth		I'm not sure anything is better then ssh.
2006-03-06T11:12:00.000Z	Absenth		If I did a "server" install of 5.10, and then later apt-get install ubuntu-desktop  is that going to change the boot mode from cli to gui?
2006-03-06T11:13:00.000Z	Absenth		well....  crapalishis :)  Thanks Seveas.
2006-03-06T11:14:00.000Z	nickrud	Absenth	if you want it to boot into the command line, sudo rm /etc/rc2.d/S13gdm
2006-03-06T11:15:00.000Z	Absenth	nickrud	that's easy enough,  Thanks.
2006-03-06T11:20:00.000Z	nickrud	Absenth	opening a dialog window with ubotu works really well
2006-03-20T11:13:00.000Z	nickrud	Absenth	I've run ubuntu quite well on about 4GB
2006-03-20T11:14:00.000Z	Absenth	nickrud	that's what I thought.  I'm trying to install in a vmware virtual machine, which I've done numerous times before, but now it's not allowing me to install
2006-03-20T11:14:00.000Z	nickrud	Absenth	I wouldn't have a clue about vmware, sorry. I've only used bare metal machines
2006-03-20T11:15:00.000Z	Absenth	nickrud	nod nod,  thing is, I get the same error if I try to install it on the drive outside of vmware as well.
2006-03-20T11:15:00.000Z	Absenth	nickrud	don't suppose you know of a live-cd based tool I can use to check the status of my hard disk?
2006-03-20T11:16:00.000Z	nickrud	Absenth	toms root boot disk, if you have a floppy is the smallest I know of
2006-03-21T12:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Absenth	you should have nvidia-settings available, don't know if it's what you want
2006-03-21T12:46:00.000Z	Absenth	nickrud	yeah,  doesn't quite cover what I was looking for, but a great tool none the less.
2006-03-21T12:46:00.000Z	Absenth	nickrud	using cedega on ubuntu breezy, WoW operates at less then 25 fps on an FX5900 Ultra.  in windows at much higher graphics settings I get closer to 75 fps.
2006-03-21T12:47:00.000Z	Absenth	nickrud	I suspect the driver just isn't as good :/
2006-03-21T12:47:00.000Z	nickrud	Absenth	:)
2007-07-19T05:13:00.000Z	nickrud	Absenth	I had that problem intermittently (I quit beryl for other reasons) there's a right click menu option reload window decorator that always got borders back for me.
2007-07-19T05:14:00.000Z	Absenth	nickrud	yeah, somewhere I think there's a config problem, because that doesn't seem to work for me.
