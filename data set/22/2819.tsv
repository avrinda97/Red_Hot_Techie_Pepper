2009-02-24T12:03:00.000Z	bitsbam		sound on intrepid has me frustrated as all getout. I installed on three computers in the house, only one that doesn't have a sound problem is the laptop.
2009-02-24T12:03:00.000Z	bitsbam		is there and easy way to disable onboard sound if you have a sound card?
2009-02-24T12:05:00.000Z	roadrock	bitsbam	yeah, change device double clicking volume control choose preferences, choose souncard. you should get and run asoundconf and set default soundcard also.
2009-02-24T12:07:00.000Z	bitsbam	roadrock	ok, top two entries were the two sound devices, then a long list of each one in alsa, etc... now do asoundconf?
2009-02-24T12:07:00.000Z	bitsbam	roadrock	i mean after choosing
2009-02-24T12:07:00.000Z	roadrock	bitsbam	asoundconf-gtk package
2009-02-24T12:08:00.000Z	bitsbam	roadrock	thanks, apting now
2009-02-24T12:09:00.000Z	bitsbam	roadrock	selected the sound card, what now?
2009-02-24T12:09:00.000Z	bitsbam	roadrock	that's it?
2009-02-24T12:10:00.000Z	roadrock	bitsbam	go into system - preferences - sound and set the device there too, you probably need to play with it
2009-02-24T12:11:00.000Z	bitsbam	roadrock	ok, thanks
2009-02-24T12:11:00.000Z	roadrock	bitsbam	choose alsa by the way
2009-02-24T12:13:00.000Z	bitsbam	roadrock	sounds great, watching a thing on miro right now. thanks for your help
2009-02-24T12:15:00.000Z	roadrock	bitsbam	glad it worked, good job, youre welcome
2009-02-24T12:32:00.000Z	bitsbam	roadrock	err, still having some trouble
2009-02-24T12:35:00.000Z	roadrock	bitsbam	running intrepid?
2009-02-24T12:37:00.000Z	roadrock	bitsbam	install alsamixer set everything. check system -prefs -sound play with settings. pulseaudio is a pain.
2009-02-24T12:37:00.000Z	bitsbam	roadrock	should i remove pulseaudio?
2009-02-24T12:38:00.000Z	roadrock	bitsbam	i purged pulse and installed esound.
2009-02-24T12:38:00.000Z	roadrock	bitsbam	with onboard sound and a soundcard you've got to experiment
2009-02-24T12:39:00.000Z	roadrock	bitsbam	i'm on hardy at the moment.
2009-02-24T12:40:00.000Z	bitsbam	roadrock	dtchen looks like i have it already, ok
