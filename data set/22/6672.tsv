2006-08-24T16:35:00.000Z	HNT		Hello everybody,
2006-08-24T16:35:00.000Z	HNT		i'v got a big problem : alsa is'nt running, so i don't have sound anymore
2006-08-24T16:35:00.000Z	HNT		'iv got alsa-tools and during the boot the message "Alsa starting up" ok , come.
2006-08-24T16:35:00.000Z	HNT		When i type ps -fe | grep alsa, i don't get anything and rcconf don't allow me to start him (alsa isn't in the list) so, any solution ?
2006-08-24T16:36:00.000Z	HNT		no idea for the alsa problem ?
2006-08-24T16:38:00.000Z	e-type	HNT	does alsamixer show your channels?
2006-08-24T16:39:00.000Z	HNT	e-type	: yes he does
2006-08-24T16:39:00.000Z	e-type	HNT	are your channels unmuted and up?
2006-08-24T16:41:00.000Z	HNT	e-type	: yes they are
2006-08-24T16:42:00.000Z	e-type	HNT	what's the error if you run an audio application from terminal?
2006-08-24T16:43:00.000Z	e-type	HNT	easiest with mplayer or a player that let's you specify the audio driver
2006-08-24T16:44:00.000Z	HNT	e-type	: (rhythmbox:5403): Rhythmbox-WARNING **: Unable to start mDNS browsing
2006-08-24T16:44:00.000Z	HNT		the only one warning
2006-08-24T16:45:00.000Z	HNT		this morning alsa runed fine, now i'v installed xgl, don't know if it influence alsa ?
2006-08-24T16:45:00.000Z	e-type	HNT	shouldn't, and that's not an alsa error
2006-08-24T16:46:00.000Z	HNT		no, not uninstall xgl but try to start with xorg, that's not logic
2006-08-24T16:46:00.000Z	e-type	HNT	what if you run esd or restart in terminal?
2006-08-24T16:46:00.000Z	e-type	HNT	erm, run/restart esd I mean
2006-08-24T16:49:00.000Z	HNT		how can i start esd ?
2006-08-24T16:49:00.000Z	e-type	HNT	by the way, alsa is in kernel space, so it will never show up in $(ps) stuff
2006-08-24T16:49:00.000Z	e-type	HNT	'$ esd' ;)
2006-08-24T16:49:00.000Z	e-type	HNT	the fact that your alsamixer shows your channels prooves that your alsa is okay
