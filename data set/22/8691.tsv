2005-06-11T08:01:00.000Z	Chislon		hello
2005-06-11T08:01:00.000Z	Chislon		im not sure what to do, not sure if i should go with ubuntu linux or freesbd..
2005-06-11T08:02:00.000Z	anto9us	Chislon	what do you want to do with it?
2005-06-11T08:04:00.000Z	Chislon	anto9us	well i want to learn python, asi hear its a good starting language, and i was told that tools for it that would cost money in windows are free in linux, and also then in freebsd, i want to get into programming and graphics, like with blender3d, however i think i may also get Flash MX to do those kinda cartoons and games, unless there is a linux type equivalent for those types of things, as flash mx is windows, but crossov
2005-06-11T08:05:00.000Z	anto9us	Chislon	All of that can be done on Ubuntu and is fairly easy to set up
2005-06-11T08:07:00.000Z	anto9us	Chislon	I think freebsd is more of a server platform than a desktop one, compared to ubuntu
2005-06-11T08:08:00.000Z	anto9us	Chislon	to be honest, I have no experience of freebsd other than what I've read
2005-06-11T08:09:00.000Z	Chislon	anto9us	ok well waht is it about ubuntu that makes it more desktop friendly then say more server related linux distros
2005-06-11T08:09:00.000Z	anto9us	Chislon	It's very pretty :)
2005-06-11T08:10:00.000Z	Chislon	anto9us	is that it? and how is it any prettier then anything else that uses gnome or kde?
2005-06-11T08:11:00.000Z	anto9us	Chislon	it's very hard to be clinical about aesthetics, not given it much thought, yes it's pretty but it works well for me, very uncluttered and very easy to set up
2005-06-11T08:12:00.000Z	Chislon	anto9us	ok thank you
2005-06-11T08:13:00.000Z	anto9us	Chislon	one of the nice things for me was how easy it was to set up a zope server with integration to a postgresql database server and as a service that starts when the machine does
2005-06-11T08:13:00.000Z	Chislon	anto9us	i have no idea what that means
2005-06-11T08:14:00.000Z	anto9us	Chislon	well, it indicated to me that a lot of thought and attention to detail is going into Ubuntu :)
2005-06-11T08:16:00.000Z	Chislon	anto9us	heh heh ok kool, thank you
2005-06-11T08:19:00.000Z	anto9us	Chislon	as a note of interest for you, Blender is a clickable install on Ubuntu, it's in the repositories
2005-06-11T08:19:00.000Z	Chislon	anto9us	ok thank you
2005-06-13T16:15:00.000Z	anto9us	Chislon	aptitude is a cli based menu driven front end to apt-get and the other package commands
2005-06-13T16:16:00.000Z	Chislon	anto9us	not sure if i understand, but thank you
2005-06-13T16:16:00.000Z	anto9us	Chislon	it gives you choices rather than you having to remember the commands :)
2005-06-13T16:17:00.000Z	Chislon	anto9us	oh ok thank you
