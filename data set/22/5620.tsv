2007-07-27T14:12:00.000Z	SpeakerMania		I just deleted a very important file that took me hours to make. It was on my Desktop. Every time I open the Trash it freezes (just the Trash window). I NEED that file. Can anyone help? What is going on? Can I manually get it back form the terminal?
2007-07-27T14:13:00.000Z	Tomcat_	SpeakerMania	Go to ~/.Trash in terminal
2007-07-27T14:14:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	Tomcat_	I'm not familiar with all the terminal commands. Could you elaborate on your statement? Thanks.
2007-07-27T14:14:00.000Z	Tomcat_	SpeakerMania	Basically, do "mv ~/.Trash/<yourfile> ~", and you'll have it in your home directory again.
2007-07-27T14:14:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	Tomcat_	many thanks. I will try this now.
2007-07-27T14:15:00.000Z	Tomcat_	SpeakerMania	If you don't know the name exactly, you can type some letters and use tab-completion.
2007-07-27T14:17:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	Tomcat_	I get an error that the file is not there. I know the file name and I tried again many times but no success. I really don't want to redo all my work.
2007-07-27T14:18:00.000Z	Tomcat_	SpeakerMania	Are you sure the name is correct? Be aware that Linux is case sensitive in files...
2007-07-27T14:18:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	Tomcat_	very sure.
2007-07-27T14:18:00.000Z	Tomcat_	SpeakerMania	Was the file on a special file system? There are several Trash folders...
2007-07-27T14:19:00.000Z	Tomcat_	SpeakerMania	If you have some time, you could do "sudo find / -iname <yourfile>" as well... that will find it.
2007-07-27T14:19:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	Tomcat_	No, just my Desktop. It was a PNG image. And I will try that, too.
2007-07-27T14:21:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	Tomcat_	the search is still running, but already it confirmed it was in ~/.Trash/
2007-07-27T14:21:00.000Z	Tomcat_	SpeakerMania	In that case, the first command should have worked... check that you made no mistakes when using that one-.
2007-07-27T14:22:00.000Z	Tomcat_	SpeakerMania	The way its shown in the "find" output is how you need to use it in "mv".
2007-07-27T14:22:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	Tomcat_	my Hard Drive is huge, how can I stop the search? Close the window?
2007-07-27T14:23:00.000Z	Tomcat_	SpeakerMania	Close the window or Ctrl+C :)
2007-07-27T14:23:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	Tomcat_	so I do "mv /home/steven/.Trash/header.png" and it will move to my home directory? Do I need "sudo"?
2007-07-27T14:24:00.000Z	Tomcat_	SpeakerMania	You need to add a target at the end... like "/home/steven"
2007-07-27T14:24:00.000Z	Tomcat_	SpeakerMania	No need to sudo.
2007-07-27T14:28:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	Tomcat_	I still get this: mv: missing destination file operand after `/home/steven/.Trash/header.png'
2007-07-27T14:30:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	Tomcat_	I still get this: mv: missing destination file operand after `/home/steven/.Trash/header.png'
