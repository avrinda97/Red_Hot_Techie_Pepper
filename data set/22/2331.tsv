2009-07-14T11:28:00.000Z	Spad-XIII		i'm having trouble with my laptop network (both wired and wireless) yesterday i booted up, wired worked just fine, wireless doesn't. today i boot up, wired doesn't work and wireless locks the whole laptop (nothing responds, have to press and hold power button for +4seconds to shutdown) the drivers all work, because it has connected to a wireless network on saturday (not mine though, but similar setup, just different router/password)
2009-07-14T11:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spad-XIII	instead run: sudo /etc/init/d/networking stop; sudo /etc/init.d/hal restart; sleep 5; sudo /etc/init.d/networking start
2009-07-14T11:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spad-XIII	hard shutdowns arent good for your hardware
2009-07-14T11:30:00.000Z	Spad-XIII	ActionParsnip	i know, but nothing responds, not the mouse, not even numlock ..
2009-07-14T11:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spad-XIII	can you ssh in?
2009-07-14T11:30:00.000Z	Spad-XIII	ActionParsnip	it doesn't have network :)
2009-07-14T11:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spad-XIII	i'd get an output of dmesg, one when wifiworks, one when wired works, and comare
2009-07-14T11:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spad-XIII	I'd check your ram
2009-07-14T11:32:00.000Z	Spad-XIII	ActionParsnip	i've never had wifi work at my place .. it keeps asking about the wpa2-password or locks up ..
2009-07-14T11:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spad-XIII	check your hard drive from live cd too with fsck
2009-07-14T11:32:00.000Z	Spad-XIII	ActionParsnip	just ran your commands, but it won't connect the wired network .. yesterday i had no problems at all..
2009-07-14T11:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spad-XIII	i'd get your ram and drive/s checked, make sure they are healthy
2009-07-14T11:34:00.000Z	Spad-XIII	ActionParsnip	i'm booting from live usb now ..
2009-07-14T11:35:00.000Z	Spad-XIII	ActionParsnip	but they should be allright .. i've been running windows on it since i bought it earlier this year without problems or lockups .. the lockup only happens when it tries to connect to my wireless and only since this last week
2009-07-14T11:36:00.000Z	Spad-XIII	ActionParsnip	lol, i boot up from live-usb and the wired network works just fine ....
2009-07-14T11:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spad-XIII	then check its dmesg as well as the output of: sudo lsh -C network
2009-07-14T11:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spad-XIII	see how it differsto the installed system
2009-07-14T11:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spad-XIII	i'd also check your harddrive
2009-07-14T11:38:00.000Z	Spad-XIII	ActionParsnip	lsh -C network, using the live-usb says that lsh isn't installed .. how fun
2009-07-14T11:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spad-XIII	you just need to see whats different, maybe one device is using a different module, or different module settings
2009-07-14T11:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Spad-XIII	maybe dmesg shows something different
2009-07-14T11:43:00.000Z	Spad-XIII	ActionParsnip	i got the dmesg output saved from the live-usb .. but the lsh isn't really working on the live .. it works fine on the installed
