2009-05-06T19:31:00.000Z	LinuxApe		Is there anyway to tell what parts of a jaunty upgrade may not be correct?  Since the upgrade, which didn't seem to finish completely, my system is messed up in a couple of key ways, like printing.
2009-05-06T19:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	run the upgrade again
2009-05-06T19:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	than it finished fine
2009-05-06T19:34:00.000Z	LinuxApe	gnomefreak	 Can't print from my system anymore, get communication errors, insert LiveCD, I can print.  Also, thunderbird (email client) was installed but didn't show up in package managers.  Reinstall caused some problems with config.
2009-05-06T19:35:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	does sudo apt-get install -f? does sudo dpkg --configure -a help?
2009-05-06T19:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	sudo dpkg --configure -a
2009-05-06T19:41:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	installing th elist of packages that is said to be not needed does that install them?
2009-05-06T19:42:00.000Z	LinuxApe	gnomefreak	the dpkg --configure -a command followed by apt-get install -f produced nothing new.
2009-05-06T19:48:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	^^^ for youy
2009-05-06T19:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	i need any and all info on the thunderbird part of this, the others are other peoples problems
2009-05-06T19:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	and sudo apt-get -f install didnt help?
2009-05-06T19:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	post your /etc/apt/sources.list file. pastebinit /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-05-06T19:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	did you use update-manager or console?
2009-05-06T19:55:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	i suggest removeing the conflcting packages than comment out the non official repos than try again (i hate that gutsy repo)
2009-05-06T19:56:00.000Z	LinuxApe	gnomefreak	danbhfive:  lines 55 and down were things I re-enabled as per upgrade instructions: "some repos disabled, re-enable after upgrade"  Don't think I should have?
2009-05-06T19:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	should not have
2009-05-06T19:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	the upgrade process klnows what it is doing
2009-05-06T19:59:00.000Z	LinuxApe	gnomefreak	 so disable those repos again, and then what command(s) do I issue to get back to "release" versions?
2009-05-06T19:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	without knowing the repo i cant say but i know what thunderbird depnds on and what rdepends are bu without knowing what is in repos i cant tell you
2009-05-06T20:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	you have to remove the packages that it says are a problem than comment out the repos than install them again
2009-05-06T20:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LinuxApe	look in synaptic or adept and look up those packages find the *ubuntu# versions
2009-05-06T20:01:00.000Z	LinuxApe	gnomefreak	 danbhfive:  Okay, trying that, thanks for the help!
