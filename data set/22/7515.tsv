2007-03-07T07:25:00.000Z	gyaresu	g3nocide	Probably res?
2007-03-07T07:40:00.000Z	gyaresu	g3nocide	are you using envy to install?
2007-03-07T07:40:00.000Z	g3nocide	gyaresu	i ahve 6.10
2007-03-07T07:40:00.000Z	g3nocide	gyaresu	i need to install 6.06 and upgrade ???
2007-03-07T07:41:00.000Z	g3nocide	gyaresu	the damn os isnt even installed yet, th installer gives me jibberish, this is the second time you've sent me something TOTALLY unrelated
2007-03-07T07:41:00.000Z	gyaresu	g3nocide	sorry. You're trying to install. I see that now.
2007-03-07T07:42:00.000Z	gyaresu	g3nocide	Yes you should start yelling that'll help.
2007-03-07T07:42:00.000Z	g3nocide	gyaresu	 every post i find, the only thing the people have in common with this problem is the video card. am i safe to just do a textual install and then set up teh drivers after, or will the video still be borked ?
2007-03-07T07:43:00.000Z	gyaresu	g3nocide	A text install should be fine. Then you can setup the resolution (which is most likely the reason)
2007-03-07T07:43:00.000Z	g3nocide	gyaresu	waht i dont get is the fact that the mouse cursor looks absolutely fine (and even works), yet the screen is like this... http://www.mattym.com/downloads/step_3.jpg
2007-03-07T07:44:00.000Z	gyaresu	g3nocide	Yeah I saw that. Weird eh?
2007-03-07T07:46:00.000Z	g3nocide	gyaresu	i guess im off to do a text install
2007-03-07T07:46:00.000Z	gyaresu	g3nocide	see you soon.
2007-03-07T08:45:00.000Z	g3nocide	gyaresu	ok, so here i am in ubuntu text only (cause tryig to log in causes things to go bad) so can you give me a link to envy so i can install the proper video drivers and get things working properly ???
2007-03-07T08:45:00.000Z	gyaresu	g3nocide	Ah. Text only. That won't help .
2007-03-07T08:46:00.000Z	g3nocide	gyaresu	yeah, like i can change to tty7 with the graphical log in interface, but the second i try that, i get the garbled junk again
2007-03-07T08:46:00.000Z	gyaresu	g3nocide	sorry. I'm not very helpful for you today... So if you check out the nvidia docs that should get you happening.
2007-03-07T08:54:00.000Z	g3nocide	gyaresu	like, im reading these install docs on the ubuntu help wiki (via lynx) and it's all instructions for GUI install, that's completely of no use to me....
2007-03-07T08:56:00.000Z	gyaresu	g3nocide	something like (first fix repos) then 'sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx linux-restricted-modules-generic' then edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf replacing nv with nvidia...
2007-03-07T08:58:00.000Z	g3nocide	gyaresu	ok thanks, i'll give it a whirl and reboot to see if things work out
2007-03-07T09:13:00.000Z	g3nocide	gyaresu	all is well, i am now rocking it, just gotta set my res to 1600x1200 and im good to start installing stuff
