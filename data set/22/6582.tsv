2006-11-04T16:29:00.000Z	boink		tip, dang keyboard
2006-11-04T16:30:00.000Z	boink		who knows, try it
2006-11-04T16:30:00.000Z	boink		I don't think there's much of a difference, Tuna
2006-11-04T16:31:00.000Z	boink		just try it
2006-11-04T16:31:00.000Z	boink		they've never used it
2006-11-04T16:31:00.000Z	boink		that's typical M$oft speak
2006-11-04T16:31:00.000Z	boink		anyway, depending on your macro .. your odds are 50-50
2006-11-04T16:32:00.000Z	boink		!nvidia
2006-11-04T16:33:00.000Z	boink		no
2006-11-04T16:33:00.000Z	jmspeex	boink	The "no" was for me?
2006-11-04T16:33:00.000Z	jmspeex	boink	any other idea how to figure out why the 64-bit version of Edgy is unusable?
2006-11-04T16:34:00.000Z	boink	jmspeex	it's usable for me, the server version that is
2006-11-04T16:35:00.000Z	jmspeex	boink	For me it takes 3x longer to boot, X does all kinds of funny things and the whole thing generally crashes in a matter of minutes. I've got a Dell D820 w/ Core 2 Duo
2006-11-04T16:36:00.000Z	jmspeex	boink	Edgy amd64 is totally broken, but Edgy i386 works.
2006-11-04T16:54:00.000Z	boink	jmspeex	and if try debian amd-64?
2006-11-04T16:55:00.000Z	jmspeex	boink	debian amd64 fails with the same problem as Edgy. Dapper amd64 seems to work, or is at least much better.
2006-11-04T16:56:00.000Z	boink	jmspeex	you could have found a good bug there, could you try a few OS's?
2006-11-04T16:56:00.000Z	jmspeex	boink	Haven't tried that. The complete list of what I tried is at https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/66500
2006-11-04T16:57:00.000Z	jmspeex	boink	The Dapper kernel seemed to work... why try FreeBSD? Also, disabling one CPU seems to help a lot.
2006-11-04T16:57:00.000Z	boink	jmspeex	to see if it's a linux issue or not
2006-11-04T16:58:00.000Z	jmspeex	boink	If Linux itself was an issue, Dapper amd64 wouldn't work.
