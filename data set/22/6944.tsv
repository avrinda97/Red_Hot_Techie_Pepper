2006-06-18T12:43:00.000Z	garryfre		Some have reported timeouts getting packages tonight.
2006-06-18T12:43:00.000Z	garryfre		!wacom
2006-06-18T12:44:00.000Z	garryfre		I would gess it would harry, any firewall worth its bits sets up to start automatically.
2006-06-18T12:45:00.000Z	garryfre		My eyes are bad, the nickname Dad is easy to miss.
2006-06-18T12:46:00.000Z	garryfre		They track together like two drunken bums
2006-06-18T12:47:00.000Z	garryfre		I think I just need to pay closer attention. Anyting longer might help, but if you have a question, go ahead and ask it I'll try to watch for it.
2006-06-18T12:48:00.000Z	garryfre		say harry Sometimes you might have to answer a few questions at first, so it learns what you want to run and what you don't want to get through.
2006-06-18T12:48:00.000Z	garryfre		!LTSP
2006-06-18T12:49:00.000Z	Messagner	garryfre	I've asked twice, can you just scroll up?
2006-06-18T12:50:00.000Z	garryfre	Messagner	Ok, On the right side of screen should be a vertical scroll bar with a little bar you can drag up, and an up and down pointing triangle at the top and bottom.
2006-06-18T12:51:00.000Z	garryfre	Messagner	Also page up and page down works as well
2006-06-18T12:51:00.000Z	Messagner	garryfre	I was telling you to do that
2006-06-18T12:53:00.000Z	garryfre	Messagner	Oh sorry. try ifconfig
2006-06-18T12:53:00.000Z	Messagner	garryfre	I did
2006-06-18T12:56:00.000Z	Messagner	garryfre	What The Fuck!?!?!?
2006-06-18T12:59:00.000Z	garryfre	Messagner	has a fairly simple question, It eludes me at the moment, sleepy time ye know. He needs to find out what his current mack address is for  his machie. He has a cable router that goes to a wireless router than it just crashed and doesn't work any more.
2006-06-18T13:00:00.000Z	Messagner	garryfre	MAC has nothing to do with it
2006-06-18T13:08:00.000Z	garryfre	Messagner	Ok, you asked to find the mac address for your system. That's not the same as a macintosh, its an anachronysm. I've forgotten what mac stands for but it is a network thing rather like an IP address. I think every network card made has a built in unique mac address.
2006-06-18T13:08:00.000Z	Messagner	garryfre	I want my wireless working, I don't care what MAC it has anymore - that was something else
2006-06-18T13:12:00.000Z	garryfre	Messagner	I found your question I need help getting my wireless to work. I am using an Airport Extreme and Ubuntu laptop. I have had this working b4. I don' tknow the answer. I gatehr that it stopped working after a crash?
