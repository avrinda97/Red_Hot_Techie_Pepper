2009-05-19T09:54:00.000Z	YangYin		anyone know why im getting this error in jaunty? error while loading shared libraries: libxcb-xlib.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2009-05-19T09:55:00.000Z	YangYin		does anyone else know if they have libxcb-xlib?
2009-05-19T09:55:00.000Z	mzz	YangYin	running what? Most likely jaunty is using libxcb-1.2 which no longer has that library. Nothing but libX11 should have been using it, but some libraries or apps accidentally linked directly t o libxcb-xlib instead of just picking it up through libX11
2009-05-19T09:56:00.000Z	YangYin	mzz	i think thats the problem... guess i gotta wait for the update to the program
2009-05-19T09:56:00.000Z	mzz	YangYin	(so the right fix here is most likely to recompile the app or lib against the newer libX11+libxcb you have, not to find libxcb-xlib)
2009-05-19T09:57:00.000Z	YangYin	mzz	its not my application... but is there a way i can lib agianst the new libx11+libxcd?
2009-05-19T09:58:00.000Z	mzz	YangYin	if you have the source to the app you're trying to run you should be able to rebuild it and fix this in the process. If you don't it may be harder.
2009-05-19T09:58:00.000Z	YangYin	mzz	no dice on access to the app source
2009-05-19T09:58:00.000Z	mzz	YangYin	what's the app?
2009-05-19T09:58:00.000Z	YangYin		2xApplicationServer client app
2009-05-19T09:59:00.000Z	YangYin		its a free version of a citrix application
2009-05-19T09:59:00.000Z	YangYin	mzz	im checking forums for possible help
2009-05-19T09:59:00.000Z	mzz	YangYin	I'd check with their support then
2009-05-19T10:00:00.000Z	mzz	YangYin	you might be able to get away with hacking up the binaries to remove the dependency, or producing a dummy libxcb-xlib.so to fulfill the dependency, but if for some bizarre reason they actually *use* libxcb-xlib that may fail spectacularly.
2009-05-19T10:00:00.000Z	YangYin	mzz	lol i suppose i could try
2009-05-19T10:01:00.000Z	mzz	YangYin	(they really shouldn't be using lixcb-xlib though, unless they're doing something weird like including a modified libX11...)
2009-05-19T10:02:00.000Z	YangYin	mzz	not sure what they do, but i found they are working on new update that is compatable with jaunty
2009-05-19T10:02:00.000Z	YangYin	mzz	im not too worried
2009-05-19T10:02:00.000Z	YangYin	mzz	thnx for all the help tho
2009-05-19T10:02:00.000Z	YangYin	mzz	very informative
2009-05-19T10:03:00.000Z	mzz	YangYin	didn't actually fix the problem though :)
2009-05-19T10:03:00.000Z	YangYin	mzz	lol no but understand the problem which sometimes is acceptable.
