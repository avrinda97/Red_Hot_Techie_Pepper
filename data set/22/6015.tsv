2007-04-17T10:53:00.000Z	Kream		hi all
2007-04-17T10:53:00.000Z	Kream		I'm having huge difficulty getting to archive.ubuntu.com
2007-04-17T10:53:00.000Z	Kream		it's completely unresponsive for me.
2007-04-17T10:54:00.000Z	Kream		a) can someone confirm this and b) where can I find a working set of up-to-date feisty mirrors?
2007-04-17T10:54:00.000Z	Kream		can anyone here reach archive.ubuntu.com ?
2007-04-17T10:55:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Kream	yea, i can get to archive.ubuntu.com without any problems
2007-04-17T10:55:00.000Z	Kream	therealnanotube	 can you confirm that you can get to in.archive.ubuntu.com ?
2007-04-17T10:55:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Kream	can you access any other websites?
2007-04-17T10:55:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Kream	hold on, let me try. i tried just plain "archive.ubuntu.com"
2007-04-17T10:56:00.000Z	Kream	therealnanotube	 absolutely. nl.archive.ubuntu.com works
2007-04-17T10:56:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Kream	yea, in.archive worked for me just fine, too
2007-04-17T11:27:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Kream	i just went to http://91.189.89.6/ and it showed up just fine.
2007-04-17T11:27:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Kream	and so is 91.189.88.31
2007-04-17T11:29:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Kream	hmm, weird, but the .6 address i just pinged failed to reply
2007-04-17T11:30:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Kream	.6 fails to reply to pings, but i can go to it through http just fine. maybe it just has a firewall rule on it to block pings?
2007-04-17T11:30:00.000Z	Kream	therealnanotube	 telnet to port 80 doesn't respond
2007-04-17T11:32:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Kream	wow, weird, telnet to port 80 fails, but i can browse the directory tree through firefox with no problems
2007-04-17T11:32:00.000Z	Kream	therealnanotube	 not opening on any browser here. no wonder apt fails.
2007-04-17T11:33:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Kream	just run "cat /etc/apt/sources.list | sed -e 's/in.ubuntu.archive.com/nl.ubuntu.archive.com/'", and you're good to go?
2007-04-17T11:33:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Kream	(oh, and dont forget to sudo, and to actually pipe the output to a file. :) but you get the idea)
2007-04-17T11:34:00.000Z	Kream	therealnanotube	 of course. I can just put .8 in the hosts file
2007-04-17T11:34:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Kream	that too. :)
