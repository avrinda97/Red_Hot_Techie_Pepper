2008-10-30T05:12:00.000Z	w3rd_		they have setup user groups pretty heavy and eliminated root use to all users other that admins

2008-10-30T05:13:00.000Z	w3rd_	bloopletech	what do you mean, this happens in all directories

2008-10-30T05:13:00.000Z	w3rd_		probably in home
2008-10-30T05:14:00.000Z	w3rd_		but i wouldnt feel comfortable storing a psswd file for htdigest in the home dir?
2008-10-30T05:15:00.000Z	bloopletech	w3rd_	in general shared hosts don't let you change files in /etc etc, only your hime dir and stuff you should be able to write to.
2008-10-30T05:15:00.000Z	w3rd_		uname doesnt mention the site config unop, ill have to check the hosts site details
2008-10-30T05:15:00.000Z	w3rd_	bloopletech	im in /misc
2008-10-30T05:16:00.000Z	bloopletech	w3rd_	you probably dont have permissions on that directory
