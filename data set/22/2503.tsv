2009-06-19T16:55:00.000Z	cowgarden		:( just installed the updates and pressed cancel when I was asked if want to keep or overwrite the old version. Thought that would stop the installation but the pakets are gone from my update list. (linux-image-2.6.28-13-generic which popped up something about debconfig oder something; another one (dunno which( popped up menue.lst or something)?
2009-06-19T16:55:00.000Z	cowgarden		now I got an error report that linux-image-2.6.28-13-generic could not be installed
2009-06-19T16:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cowgarden	does it show up in: dpkg -l | grep linux-image
2009-06-19T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cowgarden	do you need the new kernel?
2009-06-19T16:56:00.000Z	cowgarden	ActionParsnip	what is it good for?
2009-06-19T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cowgarden	is your system running on all cylinders and all hardware running ok?
2009-06-19T16:57:00.000Z	cowgarden	ActionParsnip	yes, for this mashine. All cylinders = cpu cores?
2009-06-19T16:58:00.000Z	cowgarden	ActionParsnip	 shows up: iF  linux-image-2.6.28-13-generic              2.6.28-13.44
2009-06-19T16:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cowgarden	just a colloquiualism for everything runnin ok. if its all ok you have no reason at all to install the new kernel
2009-06-19T16:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cowgarden	then run:  sudo apt-get --purge remove linux-image-2.6.28.13-generic; sudo apt-get --purge autoremove; sudo apt-get clean
2009-06-19T17:00:00.000Z	cowgarden	ActionParsnip	thank you!
2009-06-19T17:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cowgarden	if your system is running you do not have to get the new kernel.
2009-06-19T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cowgarden	if some of your harware needs the new kernel to run, then get it otherwise theres no benefit at all
2009-06-19T17:01:00.000Z	cowgarden	ActionParsnip	no performance improvements either?
2009-06-19T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cowgarden	you can check whats new to see if the new one benefits you.
2009-06-19T17:02:00.000Z	cowgarden	ActionParsnip	ok, Ill do that for me EEE-PC. I have some issues there
2009-06-19T17:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cowgarden	it may help. i even talked to a guy who needed the .30kernel for jaunty to make suff nice
2009-09-05T19:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cowgarden	tried a different theme?
2009-09-05T19:06:00.000Z	cowgarden	ActionParsnip	It just appear some times and not just vlc and not on the startup of the GUI, I don't know what triggers it
2009-09-05T19:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cowgarden	i'd ask in #compiz
