2007-03-20T16:35:00.000Z	leagris	Xsylotte	you can try purging XUL.mfasl from the firefox profile.
2007-03-20T16:37:00.000Z	leagris	Xsylotte	in your home directory there is a directory containing your current firefox settings and temporary files. It is like : .mozilla/firefox/2shuf1vi.default/
2007-03-20T16:39:00.000Z	leagris	Xsylotte	inside this directory there is a file XUL.mfasl you can safely remove (temp work file recreated upon firefox restart)
2007-06-19T14:04:00.000Z	leagris	Xsylotte	version conflicts mostly relate to repository out of sync or outdated tier repos not updated
2007-06-19T14:05:00.000Z	leagris	Xsylotte	you can try other repos. Region specific repos may be out of sync some times
2007-06-19T14:07:00.000Z	Xsylotte	leagris	same, r-base is 2.5, but r-core is 2.4
2007-06-19T14:09:00.000Z	leagris	Xsylotte	worked here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26234/
2007-06-19T14:11:00.000Z	Xsylotte	leagris	can you give me specific url for that repo ?
2007-06-19T14:11:00.000Z	leagris	Xsylotte	I'll paste my sources.list if that help you
2007-06-19T14:12:00.000Z	leagris	Xsylotte	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26235/
2007-06-19T14:15:00.000Z	leagris	Xsylotte	that's why I installed 32bit ubuntu despite my CPU is AMD64
2007-06-19T14:16:00.000Z	Xsylotte	leagris	is there some difference ?
2007-06-19T14:16:00.000Z	leagris	Xsylotte	much less trouble, and like between 5% and 10% speed difference overall
2007-06-19T14:17:00.000Z	leagris	Xsylotte	speed 5% to 10% less than 64bit. Reliability same, less trouble with 32bit only binaries like flashplayer and more support.
2007-06-19T14:19:00.000Z	Xsylotte	leagris	just one more question, if i install x86 ubuntu, then i choose x86 packages...right ?
2007-06-19T14:20:00.000Z	leagris	Xsylotte	that's the default, x86 repos are used
2007-06-19T16:22:00.000Z	Xsylotte	leagris	thx :D
