2009-01-10T07:51:00.000Z	tinker_		Hi;
2009-01-10T07:51:00.000Z	tinker_		I'm using Ubuntu 8.04 on a 6 year old PC. I have been using Ubuntu for several years and everything done to that machine in terms of drivers has been done by Ubuntu.
2009-01-10T07:51:00.000Z	tinker_		I recently tried to upgrade to Ubuntu 8.10 and got this error message
2009-01-10T07:51:00.000Z	tinker_		==========================================================
2009-01-10T07:51:00.000Z	tinker_		This computer is currently using the NVIDIA 'nvidia' graphics driver.
2009-01-10T07:51:00.000Z	tinker_		What is flooding?
2009-01-10T07:52:00.000Z	tinker_		okay, thanks
2009-01-10T07:53:00.000Z	tinker_		I'm trying to upgrade from 8.04 -> 8.10, the update manager complains it can't find a driver for my video card, yet I've had ubuntu on my box for years.  Anyone know why this now a problem?
2009-01-10T07:55:00.000Z	tinker_		I'm I stuck in 8.04 because my video card is too old to have a new driver for 8.10?
2009-01-10T07:56:00.000Z	tinker_		Im getting the info
2009-01-10T07:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tinker_	somehow i'd find that very unlikely, but until you tell us what card, its hard to say
2009-01-10T07:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tinker_	use the legacy driver, it should be fine
2009-01-10T07:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tinker_	uh, no.. it should be in restricted driver manager I would think.. (System/Admin/Hardware drivers)
2009-01-10T07:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tinker_	no,  after you update, it *should* work after you enable it.... do you have it enabled on 8.04?
2009-01-10T08:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tinker_	ok, does it reference your nvidia driver?
2009-01-10T08:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tinker_	ok, so what makes you think it won't work in 8.10?
2009-01-10T08:01:00.000Z	tinker_	IndyGunFreak	 when I run update manager it stops with an error message saying it can't find a new driver for me
2009-01-10T08:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tinker_	doesn't make much sense....
2009-01-10T08:02:00.000Z	tinker_	IndyGunFreak	it didn't occur to me that I could tell update manager to go ahead anyway, let me try that
2009-01-10T08:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tinker_	if that doesn't work, try disabling the restricted driver, restart, run update manager, then once everything is updated, try to reenable the driver.. but it should work in 8.10 w/ the legacy driver (note *should* make sure you have stuff backed up just in case)
2009-01-10T08:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tinker_	any important files, etc..
2009-01-10T08:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tinker_	lol, good luck
