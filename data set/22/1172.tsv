2010-09-06T03:38:00.000Z	on3pk		hey guys, whats the best way of sharing files between say, my home computer and a McDonald's WIFI hotspot
2010-09-06T03:39:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	samba
2010-09-06T03:40:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	if there is a local area network you may share files using samba
2010-09-06T03:41:00.000Z	on3pk	bodwick	would that not be possible over an internet connection, just intranet?
2010-09-06T03:41:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	if you want to share files over internet you can use ssh or ftp
2010-09-06T03:42:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	so if theres a lan -> samba, if not -> ssh or ftp
2010-09-06T03:42:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	you want to share files with windows clients ?
2010-09-06T03:43:00.000Z	on3pk	bodwick	well, I want to share files between my netbook (ubuntu) and my laptop (windows 7)
2010-09-06T03:44:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	Ubuntu One ;)
2010-09-06T03:46:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	Dropbox is the same as Ubuntu One but not from ubuntu
2010-09-06T03:46:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	it's a cloud account - 2gb for free
2010-09-06T03:48:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	it automagically synchronizes files
2010-09-06T03:48:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	yup, but i don't know if there's a windows client, dropbox has a client for every major os
2010-09-06T03:48:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	i use wicd not network manager so i have to use dropbox and i like it
2010-09-06T03:48:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	so you can try dropbox, it's pretty good
2010-09-06T03:50:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	hmm .. the only drawback is that you can share one folder .. i think
2010-09-06T03:50:00.000Z	on3pk	bodwick	does... "/" and "C:\" count?
2010-09-06T03:51:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	but you can't share for example ~/Dropbox and ~/Documents/Pictures
2010-09-06T03:56:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	just made a little experiment and you can make a link of anything to Dropbox :)
2010-09-06T04:00:00.000Z	on3pk	bodwick	howso?
2010-09-06T04:01:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	if you put a link to eg ~/Documents/Pics into ~/Dropbox it will share the Pics folder
2010-09-06T04:01:00.000Z	bodwick	on3pk	so you can share anything just by making symlinks to Dropbox default dir
