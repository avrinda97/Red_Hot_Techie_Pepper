2010-01-26T22:25:00.000Z	jez9999		Hi.  I have gotten my dhcp3-server service running, and it is successfully assigning my client an IP address.  However, that client's packets are not being forwarded to the internet.  any ideas why this might happen?
2010-01-26T22:26:00.000Z	Firekraag	jez9999	Sounds that the router might not be properly configured
2010-01-26T22:26:00.000Z	jez9999	Firekraag	howso, though?  It's like it's doing DHCP, but not NAT.
2010-01-26T22:26:00.000Z	jez9999		why would it do that?
2010-01-26T22:26:00.000Z	Firekraag	jez9999	Have you tried to wireshark over your network?
2010-01-26T22:26:00.000Z	jez9999		listening for what?
2010-01-26T22:26:00.000Z	Firekraag	jez9999	If I understand your PC is a DHCP and the router?
2010-01-26T22:27:00.000Z	jez9999		yes
2010-01-26T22:27:00.000Z	Firekraag	jez9999	listening from when your client connects to when it tries to ping google.com for instance
2010-01-26T22:28:00.000Z	jez9999	Firekraag	i suspect i will see the incoming packets but this box just won't forward them out
2010-01-26T22:28:00.000Z	Firekraag	jez9999	what if you assign to your client the Ip manually?
2010-01-26T22:28:00.000Z	jez9999		doesn't work either
2010-01-26T22:28:00.000Z	jez9999		but the DHCP part of things now seems to be working fine
2010-01-26T22:28:00.000Z	Firekraag	jez9999	ok so it's definitely not a dhcp issue
2010-01-26T22:29:00.000Z	Firekraag	jez9999	well you have to configure the router feature, NAT/PAT and so on
2010-01-26T22:29:00.000Z	jez9999		doesnt dhcpd-3 deal with all of that?
2010-01-26T22:29:00.000Z	Firekraag	jez9999	maybe it's a firewall blocking outgoing traffic
2010-01-26T22:29:00.000Z	jez9999		no, i enabled all traffic in iptables
2010-01-26T22:29:00.000Z	Firekraag	jez9999	a DHCP server is not a router
2010-01-26T22:29:00.000Z	jez9999		so what takes care of the NAT stuff then?
2010-01-26T22:30:00.000Z	Firekraag	jez9999	i don't know how to implement that on a PC but you've got to find a software that will do the routing and NAT/PAT i guess
2010-01-26T22:31:00.000Z	Firekraag	jez9999	DHCP and IP routing are different processes, the DHCP server and router can be different machines also
