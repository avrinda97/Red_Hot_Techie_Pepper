2007-01-10T10:43:00.000Z	J0HN		can anybody please help me with some resolution issues?
2007-01-10T10:44:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	what seems to be the problem?
2007-01-10T10:44:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	install drivers you mean?
2007-01-10T10:46:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	you can edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and try manually configuring resolution
2007-01-10T10:50:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	by editing your /etc/X11/xorg.conf, you can go to display section and add your resolution, that probably can able you to change it
2007-01-10T10:50:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	section "screen" to be exact
2007-01-10T10:53:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	its worth a try yea, though you probably would have to restart X for changes, in case you cant restart X, just re-edit xorg.conf and leave it as it was
2007-01-10T10:54:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	ctrl + alt + F1 /  login as root / init 3 , then init 5
2007-01-10T10:58:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	any luck?
2007-01-10T10:59:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	which video card you got
2007-01-10T11:01:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	on windows you can do 1024x768?
2007-01-10T11:02:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	yea.. when you boot with live cd you can do that reS?>
2007-01-10T11:02:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	you probably need the proper ATI driver
2007-01-10T11:03:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	you tried that?
2007-01-10T11:06:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-01-10T11:21:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	did you try with ./ before the file
2007-01-10T11:22:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	enter a terminal, go to the file dir, type sudo ./filename
2007-01-10T11:23:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	well then download that
2007-01-10T11:35:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	for changes in video you need to restart X
2007-01-10T11:40:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-01-10T11:41:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-01-10T11:41:00.000Z	juano_	J0HN	try second comment, ignore first
