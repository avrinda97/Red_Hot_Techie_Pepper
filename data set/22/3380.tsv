2009-06-27T04:28:00.000Z	dazjorz		could anybody help me answer my question above? - (on where to file a bug to request qt 4.5.1 in jaunty)
2009-06-27T04:29:00.000Z	matreya6	dazjorz	That's not really a bug now is it? More like a feature request.
2009-06-27T04:30:00.000Z	dazjorz	matreya6	there are a few bugs in qt 4.5.0 which manifest themselves as crashes in other programs, so it's really fixing multiple bugs
2009-06-27T04:31:00.000Z	dazjorz	matreya6	not for new features, 4.5.1 is mainly a bug-fixing release, not only "regular" bugs but also crash fixes
2009-06-27T04:32:00.000Z	matreya6	dazjorz	in that case you should file it as a bug against qtlib, with dependencies pointing to it from the programs that crash.
2009-06-27T04:32:00.000Z	dazjorz	matreya6	good idea, let's try that
2009-06-27T04:32:00.000Z	dazjorz	matreya6	though I think qt 4.5.1 is already in backports for jaunty, still apparantly people don't have backports enabled
2009-06-27T04:33:00.000Z	dazjorz	matreya6	anything you can tell me about that? is it enabled by default? etc
2009-06-27T04:33:00.000Z	matreya6	dazjorz	That's their choice :-)
2009-06-27T04:33:00.000Z	dazjorz	matreya6	most of the time, they have no clue
2009-06-27T04:39:00.000Z	dazjorz	matreya6	I wish I could help you with your RAID problem, but I've never done RAID
2009-06-27T04:39:00.000Z	dazjorz	matreya6	though, most problems of the BIOS skipping grub, is that it's not installed in the mbr of the first drive correctly, I don't think RAID is related to that, then again, I've never done it so I don't know for sure
2009-06-27T04:40:00.000Z	dazjorz	matreya6	try sudo grub-install /dev/sda and such things
2009-06-27T04:40:00.000Z	matreya6	dazjorz	at the moment I don't have an install on that box yet that recognizes my RAID setup.
2009-06-27T04:40:00.000Z	dazjorz	matreya6	I think RAID setup only starts after grub, possibly...
2009-06-27T04:41:00.000Z	matreya6	dazjorz	Hardware RAID definitely starts before grub
2009-06-27T04:41:00.000Z	dazjorz	matreya6	okay, well, I'll shut up
2009-06-27T04:41:00.000Z	matreya6	dazjorz	Thank you for trying, really I appreciate it, I wish it were that simple :-)
2009-06-27T04:42:00.000Z	dazjorz	matreya6	wish I could help you more :)
2009-06-27T04:42:00.000Z	matreya6	dazjorz	Thasnks for your kindness, I hope there is still someone around that can help with that...
2009-06-27T04:42:00.000Z	dazjorz	matreya6	usually ##linux is more helpful in more lower-level questions like that :)
2009-06-27T04:43:00.000Z	matreya6	dazjorz	Thanks for the suggestion, joining #linux now...
