2007-10-14T12:56:00.000Z	Rich4		rob: How do I go about setting it up? Do I need to create two partitions for linux?
2007-10-14T12:57:00.000Z	Rich4		rob: I have windows on a larger partition; linux has some 20-30 GB to work with
2007-10-14T12:58:00.000Z	Rich4		rob: logicals? :S
2007-10-14T12:59:00.000Z	Rich4		rob: partition for swap can be 3-5 GB?
2007-10-14T13:01:00.000Z	Rich4		rob: What hd space does linux take to install? would 1024mb be sufficient ?
2007-10-14T13:01:00.000Z	Rich4		rob: ok. thanks
2007-10-14T13:03:00.000Z	Rich4		rob: so I install ubuntu on two partitions; one partition of 1024mb, and the other, for example, 25gb?
2007-10-14T13:05:00.000Z	Rich4		rob: thank you. and would you suggest a program as 'wine' for running windows prog?
2007-10-14T13:06:00.000Z	Rich4		rob: thanks again.

2007-10-14T13:13:00.000Z	Rich4		is there a method by which I can reformat/partition via linux?
2007-10-14T13:14:00.000Z	Rich4	rob	do I use these programs while in linux? or must I operate them from another OS or otherwise?
2007-10-14T13:16:00.000Z	Rich4	rob	would you advise that I use the partitioner in the installer?
2007-10-14T13:20:00.000Z	Rich4	rob	should I create the swap partition at the beginning or the end?
2007-10-14T13:21:00.000Z	Rich4	rob	and make both partitions logically?
2007-10-14T13:21:00.000Z	rob	Rich4	please stop that
2007-10-14T13:21:00.000Z	Rich4		stop including your name? It's my fault. sorry
2007-10-14T13:22:00.000Z	rob	Rich4	its not that you are including my name, you are actually using my exact name instead of rob125
