2011-10-20T16:22:00.000Z	kriss_	phlak_user	well uhmm lock screen doesnt do a logoff. it locks the screen.. and i need it activated by inactivity.
2011-10-20T16:23:00.000Z	phlak_user	kriss_	it doesnt do a logoff but it is activated by inactivity
2011-10-20T16:21:00.000Z	phlak_user	kriss_	just click on lock screen
2011-10-20T16:24:00.000Z	phlak_user	kriss_	well, the lock screen app gets activated by inactivity; it waits for a password to unlock again
2011-10-20T16:25:00.000Z	phlak_user	kriss_	oh ok; i understand now -  you need a "switch user" utility
2011-10-20T16:34:00.000Z	phlak_user	kriss_	i havent tried this but apparently setting the TMOUT value in /etc/profile does it; not sure if it works for Gnome
2011-10-20T16:49:00.000Z	phlak_user	kriss_	i am able to run PEAP quite successfully
2011-10-20T16:50:00.000Z	kriss_	phlak_user	uhmm well how to you tell linux to take your login credencials and use that to connect to a certain wifi in order to get the actual account info ?
2011-10-20T16:52:00.000Z	phlak_user	kriss_	well you enable wpa-enterprise in your ap/router which in turn looks at a RADIUS server; in the linux client, when you connect to the AP, it throws up a dialog where you can enter the username and password
2011-10-20T16:55:00.000Z	phlak_user	kriss_	why would Ubuntu do a domain logon?
2011-10-20T16:56:00.000Z	kriss_	phlak_user	well thats the point of having a domain. you have all the users at one place. I can connect to the domain just fine with any computer. Only i cant connect to it via wifi since the wifi needs login credencials in order to connect. Basicly without a connection to the AD users cant login to the computer.
2011-10-20T16:57:00.000Z	phlak_user	kriss_	i know that, my point is that why dont you logon as local user into the ubuntu pc and then setup the Wi-Fi auth in Network manager and then logout
2011-10-20T17:01:00.000Z	phlak_user	kriss_	WPA-Enterprise is used to allow people to access the Wi-Fi Network by authenticating them against a RADIUS server - at the backend could be an AD server, an LDAP server, a SQL database
2011-10-20T17:04:00.000Z	phlak_user	kriss_	what you are looking for is Domain Logons
2011-10-20T17:08:00.000Z	phlak_user	kriss_	is this what you want to achieve -> https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/likewise-open.html
2011-10-20T17:09:00.000Z	kriss_	phlak_user	im already using Lw-open to join the domain. That works like a charm. But the problem with wifi is that i cant connect to the wifi before ive supplied it with user credencials.. and it has to be done before i actually get logged in (as the computer obviously dont know my account untill its verified it)
2011-10-20T17:11:00.000Z	phlak_user	kriss_	not sure i know how to do that
2011-10-20T17:11:00.000Z	kriss_	phlak_user	the main problem is tha tonly solution ive seen involves wpa_supplicant to be supplied with username and password - which defies the purpose of having a AD with usercredencials
2011-10-20T17:11:00.000Z	kriss_	phlak_user	exactly.. thats the main thing keeping Windows in its posision here.
2011-10-20T17:15:00.000Z	phlak_user	kriss_	does this give any clues -> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=970987
2011-10-20T17:18:00.000Z	kriss_	phlak_user	sadly ive read that post long ago. Its for wired network.. plus we dont use certificate here. But ill try to contact the guy who wrote that to see if he knows anything.
2011-10-20T17:20:00.000Z	phlak_user	kriss_	oh ok
