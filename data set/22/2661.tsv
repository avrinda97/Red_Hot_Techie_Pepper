2011-07-23T19:23:00.000Z	ajah		how to i see the workgroup witch i create from samba server configuration gui
2011-07-23T19:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	ajah	 it should be in /etc/samba/smb.conf  or try the smbtree or findsmb command.
2011-07-23T19:26:00.000Z	ajah	dr_willis	MSHOME section what refers to
2011-07-23T19:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	ajah	 thats your workgroup i think
2011-07-23T19:31:00.000Z	ajah	dr_willis	sorry for question but how can i access shares on my workgroup of ubuntu machine from windows xp machine ?
2011-07-23T19:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	ajah	 you should be able to browse to the machine, same as you would any other share on the network. You prob. should make the 'workgroup' the same
2011-07-23T19:34:00.000Z	ajah	dr_willis	thanks your second suggestion directly with ip of the host work for me
2011-09-10T16:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	ajah	 you mean you turned on 'compiz' ? via 'compiz --replace' ?
2011-09-10T16:29:00.000Z	ajah	dr_willis	just start it from shell ccsm and try the effects
2011-09-10T16:29:00.000Z	ajah	dr_willis	doesn`t work
2011-09-10T16:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	ajah	 you ran 'compiz --replace' ? yes/no?
2011-09-10T16:30:00.000Z	ajah	dr_willis	i run this now i don`t see the top button on windows like remove and minimize
2011-09-10T16:31:00.000Z	ajah	dr_willis	and i cant move the windows
2011-09-10T16:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	ajah	 compiz handles the 'special effects' If it carshes or cant run due to drivers/hardware - you lose the titlebar/contorlss on the top of the window.
2011-09-10T16:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	ajah	 thts why ccsm was doing nothing.. compiz was not running.
2011-09-10T16:32:00.000Z	ajah	dr_willis	so compiz is not compatible with my machine?
2011-09-10T16:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	ajah	  Youhave not stated what your hardware is... so we dont know.
2011-09-10T16:34:00.000Z	ajah	dr_willis	i hope this can help to tell me 00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Mobile PM965/GM965/GL960 Memory Controller Hub (rev 03)
2011-09-10T16:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	ajah	 so you have a Intem GM965 like it says.
2011-09-10T16:35:00.000Z	ajah	dr_willis	is this compatible with compiz?
2011-09-10T16:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	ajah	 should be if the drivers support 3d.
2011-09-18T11:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	ajah	 i belive not all wirless cards in linux can do ad-hoc - ive never had it working the few times ive tried.
