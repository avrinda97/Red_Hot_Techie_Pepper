2011-07-02T17:12:00.000Z	orchata		Hi guys, My wireless does not detect any wireless networks. Using ubuntu 11.04 fresh install - acer 3620
2011-07-02T17:13:00.000Z	acicula	orchata	did you do an online installation/updated the machine yet?
2011-07-02T17:13:00.000Z	orchata	acicula	no I have not updated yet
2011-07-02T17:14:00.000Z	acicula	orchata	best to do that first then if you have access to a network cable
2011-07-02T17:14:00.000Z	orchata	acicula	OK. Thanks, that is what I am doing now
2011-07-02T23:04:00.000Z	acicula	orchata	if its supported in most cases it is installed by ubuntu or can be enable via the hardware driver tool
2011-07-02T23:05:00.000Z	orchata	acicula	Well, I am not sure if it is installed
2011-07-02T23:06:00.000Z	acicula	orchata	can  you see any wireless networks ?
2011-07-02T23:06:00.000Z	orchata	acicula	Nope
2011-07-02T23:07:00.000Z	acicula	orchata	have you installed any updates yet?
2011-07-02T23:07:00.000Z	orchata	acicula	It is not my computer, I am just trying to reanimate it. It used to run XP and now installed ubuntu 11.04. (Wireless works just fine in XP, even the indicator light is on)
2011-07-02T23:09:00.000Z	orchata	acicula	I believe it did. Because put it to update and just left
2011-07-02T23:09:00.000Z	orchata	acicula	Now I don't have any internet access on that computer
2011-07-02T23:09:00.000Z	acicula	orchata	the initial basic steps are make sure its updated, that means plugging in a cable, then use "Additional drivers" and check if you need to enable a driver for your wifi. If you still dont see networks in your network applet you may need to do more. Also lspci in a console will list exactly what wifi card.
2011-07-02T23:09:00.000Z	acicula	orchata	the wired connection does not work either?
2011-07-02T23:14:00.000Z	orchata	acicula	I don't have any internet access right now. I am connected to my cell phone with my own laptop. But I cannot do that to the other laptop because updating computer with my cell will be pretty expensive
2011-07-02T23:14:00.000Z	acicula	orchata	yeah i can imagine
2011-07-02T23:15:00.000Z	acicula	orchata	ill have a look at that chip, but i guess its going to be what limpc says, its supproted but you need to update first

2011-07-02T23:18:00.000Z	acicula	orchata	according to the wiki it might work without updating if you run apt-get update && sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source and then try to active the driver via additional drivers
2011-07-02T23:20:00.000Z	acicula	orchata	good luck
2011-07-03T00:40:00.000Z	acicula	orchata	best to just use the package manager for installing programs. You can copy over the installation files themselves though so you wont have to redownload the packages
