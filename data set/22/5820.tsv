2007-04-06T14:42:00.000Z	jack_deltrino		I'm having problems with GDM. When I start my Ubuntu machine up, I get taken over to terminal 7 and a weird white box about 100 pixel height by 768 width shows up
2007-04-06T14:42:00.000Z	jack_deltrino		Anyone have this problem? If so, how do I fix it?
2007-04-06T14:43:00.000Z	jack_deltrino		Also, unrelated, but why would lsusb not show devices that are connected to a computer?
2007-04-06T14:43:00.000Z	jack_deltrino		The devices in question work on another Linux box.
2007-04-06T14:43:00.000Z	jack_deltrino		I've run modprobe uhci-hcd and modprobe ehci-hcd
2007-04-06T14:44:00.000Z	jack_deltrino		Anyone?
2007-04-06T14:45:00.000Z	Jowi	jack_deltrino	lsusb should show the usb device connected.
2007-04-06T14:45:00.000Z	jack_deltrino	Jowi	Yes it should, but it doesn't.
2007-04-06T14:45:00.000Z	Jowi	jack_deltrino	mine show both the controllers and usb mouse/keyboard + camera
2007-04-06T14:45:00.000Z	jack_deltrino	Jowi	And these devices show up with lsusb on another Linux box (that doesn't run ubuntu).
2007-04-06T14:46:00.000Z	Jowi	jack_deltrino	you might want to try a different kernel or load the correct drivers for the device.
2007-04-06T14:46:00.000Z	jack_deltrino	Jowi	modprobe uhci-hcd && modprobe ehci-hcd
2007-04-06T14:46:00.000Z	jack_deltrino	Jowi	What more? That alone makes it work with udev on another Linux ox.
2007-04-06T14:47:00.000Z	Jowi	jack_deltrino	don't know. what type of device is it?
2007-04-06T14:49:00.000Z	Jowi	jack_deltrino	if it is a usbstorage device try to modprobe usbcore and usb-storage as well.
2007-04-06T14:50:00.000Z	jack_deltrino	Jowi	Well, all the kernel modules are being loaded by Ubuntu apparently.
2007-04-06T14:51:00.000Z	jack_deltrino	Jowi	And on other distributions it just works with those two modules.
2007-04-06T14:51:00.000Z	Jowi	jack_deltrino	you never answerd my question. what type of device is it? which kernel are you running (uname -a)
2007-04-06T14:52:00.000Z	jack_deltrino	Jowi	I didn't say it was one device. I was saying none of the USB devices were working.
2007-04-06T14:52:00.000Z	jack_deltrino	Jowi	It's 2.6.20. Feisty.
2007-04-06T14:52:00.000Z	Jowi	jack_deltrino	feisty is beta. go to #ubuntu+1
2007-04-06T14:54:00.000Z	Jowi	jack_deltrino	sounds like a kernel driver problem but I'm not sure. feisty support is in #ubuntu+1
