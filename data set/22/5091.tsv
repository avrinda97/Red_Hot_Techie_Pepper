2007-08-23T05:24:00.000Z	ward_	musikgoat|laptop	doestn seem to help
2007-08-23T05:25:00.000Z	ward_	musikgoat|laptop	but in the help of the modem it even says its not possible to port forward stuff that are comming in from outside :s
2007-08-23T05:25:00.000Z	musikgoat|laptop	ward_	not alot of modems have routing,   what is your ip address that you get from the modem?
2007-08-23T05:26:00.000Z	ward_	musikgoat|laptop	my modem is connected to my router, DHCP is off on the modem, the ip my router gets from the modem = 192.168.2.1, the ip i have from the router is 192.168.2.3
2007-08-23T05:28:00.000Z	musikgoat|laptop	ward_	what speedtouch 510 version is it
2007-08-23T05:28:00.000Z	ward_	musikgoat|laptop	a v4, latest firmware installed
2007-08-23T05:29:00.000Z	musikgoat|laptop	ward_	this doesn't do it?  http://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Thomson-Alcatel/SpeedTouch510v4.0/FTP.htm
2007-08-23T05:30:00.000Z	ward_	musikgoat|laptop	i cant even find the list of modems on that site, first time i see this
2007-08-23T05:32:00.000Z	ward_	musikgoat|laptop	thats exactly what i did and that didnt work
2007-08-23T05:33:00.000Z	ward_	musikgoat|laptop	they save fine, portforwarding jsut doenst seem to work, and the router is fairly straightforward, should work fine
2007-08-23T05:35:00.000Z	musikgoat|laptop	ward_	what are you trying to forward?
2007-08-23T05:35:00.000Z	ward_	musikgoat|laptop	http
2007-08-23T05:36:00.000Z	ward_	musikgoat|laptop	but i also tried another port, and forward that into port 80, didnt work either
2007-08-23T05:39:00.000Z	musikgoat|laptop	ward_	why do you think your ISP may not be blocking 80?
2007-08-23T05:39:00.000Z	ward_	musikgoat|laptop	i tested another port too (and surfed to it the right way)
2007-08-23T05:40:00.000Z	ward_	musikgoat|laptop	so what i tried too: portforward port 8888 entering the modem from outside, to port 80 going trough the router
2007-08-23T05:41:00.000Z	musikgoat|laptop	ward_	and that didn't work as well?
2007-08-23T05:41:00.000Z	ward_	musikgoat|laptop	correct, that didnt work, shall i try it again to make sure i didnt overlook anything?
2007-08-23T05:42:00.000Z	musikgoat|laptop	ward_	I would try direct to your modem
2007-08-23T05:42:00.000Z	ward_	musikgoat|laptop	great idea, brb
