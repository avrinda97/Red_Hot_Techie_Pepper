2007-04-07T16:51:00.000Z	rdz		hello everyone. which command is executed, when i press 'alt' + PrtScr?
2007-04-07T16:53:00.000Z	Tmob	rdz	you can use 'convert'
2007-04-07T16:53:00.000Z	Tmob	rdz	its an imagemagick client
2007-04-07T16:54:00.000Z	rdz	Tmob	i can capture a window as a picture with convert? how to do that?
2007-04-07T16:54:00.000Z	Tmob	rdz	i dont think it does just a window.. it takes the entire screen shot
2007-04-07T16:54:00.000Z	Tmob	rdz	i remember seeing something like that in its args .. but i'm not sure
2007-04-07T16:55:00.000Z	Tmob	rdz	infact.. they named it 'import'
2007-04-07T16:55:00.000Z	Tmob	rdz	not convert.. they are all part of ImageMagick.. man on it
2007-04-07T16:55:00.000Z	rdz	Tmob	yeah, but alt+prtscr snapshots only the acual window. it is on my system and it works, i ust want to know the command name
2007-04-07T16:55:00.000Z	Tmob	rdz	i thought alt_prtscr is a shortcut key for gnome-screenshot
2007-04-07T16:56:00.000Z	rdz	Tmob	ah ok.. thank you
2007-04-07T16:56:00.000Z	Tmob	rdz	in future. ps ux
2007-04-07T16:57:00.000Z	rdz	Tmob	what do you mean by that?
2007-04-07T16:58:00.000Z	Tmob	rdz	`ps ux`
2007-04-07T16:58:00.000Z	Tmob		run it in a shell
2007-04-07T16:58:00.000Z	Tmob		!info import
2007-04-07T16:58:00.000Z	Tmob		!info openvpn
2007-04-07T16:59:00.000Z	Tmob		heh cool
2007-04-07T16:59:00.000Z	rdz	Tmob	i still cannot follow. it does print all running commands... what are you trying to tell me?
2007-04-07T16:59:00.000Z	Tmob	rdz	blah.. you can find which program is running when you press alt prt
2007-04-07T05:00:00.000Z	Tmob		by looking at the list and just reading thru the args.. do i have to explain more?
2007-04-07T05:00:00.000Z	rdz	Tmob	ah , ok.. i understand now.... thank you... yes, i'll try that in the future
