2008-10-30T08:23:00.000Z	ChickenGirl		guess I'm on universal ignore or something
2008-10-30T08:24:00.000Z	ChickenGirl		well, see, you could have SAID "sorry, you've stumped us" instead of ignoring me
2008-10-30T08:25:00.000Z	ChickenGirl		one person would be nice
2008-10-30T08:25:00.000Z	ChickenGirl		otherwise I don't know if anyone even *saw* what I said

2008-10-30T08:27:00.000Z	Serraphyn	ChickenGirl	in life as in the internet you don't always get anwers, besides a general question like, I don't gets video, help me please does not give enough information.  Try stating Version, and relevant hardware information like video card and type.  Also explain abit of what you have tried.
