2007-03-25T15:51:00.000Z	max_	tbuss	youo can have drive F: on their windows computer connect to your /home/shares folder - i used the walkthru on ubuntuguide.org and set up samba really nicely
2007-03-25T15:52:00.000Z	tbuss	max_	is this possible if two machines are separated geographically
2007-03-25T15:52:00.000Z	max_	tbuss	as long as their connected to your network in any way
2007-03-25T15:53:00.000Z	max_	tbuss	including internet
2007-03-25T15:55:00.000Z	max_	tbuss	sudo apt-get install proftpd
2007-03-25T15:55:00.000Z	max_	tbuss	then all they have to do is ftp://your ip
2007-03-25T15:56:00.000Z	tbuss	max_	Im running proftpd right now, I'm just unsure how to configure to meet my specific needs
2007-03-25T15:56:00.000Z	max_	tbuss	just make sure you open port 21 in your router and in linux's iptables
2007-03-25T15:56:00.000Z	max_	tbuss	make a user with adduser - then put the files you want to share in the home folder ofo the new user
2007-03-25T15:56:00.000Z	tbuss	max_	I opened port 21 on the config file but not for the router?
2007-03-25T15:57:00.000Z	max_	tbuss	you need to "port forward" in your rouoter so that port 21 isn't blocked by your router's hardware firewall
2007-03-25T15:57:00.000Z	max_	tbuss	same with running any service
2007-03-25T15:57:00.000Z	max_	tbuss	usually its http://192.168.1.1 to connect to your rouoter
2007-03-25T15:58:00.000Z	tbuss	max_	you had to ask ;) its a microsoft wireless router
2007-03-25T15:58:00.000Z	tbuss	max_	 will i get in trouble for posting that
2007-03-25T15:58:00.000Z	max_	tbuss	it's documentation will tell you how to enable services so you can host an ftp server
2007-03-25T15:58:00.000Z	tbuss	max_	 but basically what I want to do is open port 21 on my router correct
2007-03-25T15:59:00.000Z	tbuss	max_	trond: Flannel: thanks for your help
2007-03-25T16:00:00.000Z	max_	tbuss	i mean
2007-03-25T16:00:00.000Z	max_	tbuss	sudo apt-get install firestarter
2007-03-26T16:01:00.000Z	tbuss	max_	okay I'm going to try and configure this thing. If it doesnt take too long I'll post back
