2010-11-18T08:24:00.000Z	gogeta1	pdg1	yea
2010-11-18T08:24:00.000Z	gogeta1	pdg1	atm you should have 2 partation recovery and windows
2010-11-18T08:24:00.000Z	gogeta1	pdg1	maybe 3 if you have express gate
2010-11-18T08:25:00.000Z	pdg1		i have 4
2010-11-18T08:25:00.000Z	gogeta1	pdg1	4?
2010-11-18T08:26:00.000Z	pdg1	gogeta1	: yeah, but one is 21mb
2010-11-18T08:26:00.000Z	gogeta1	pdg1	well windows will be the largest and safe to resize
2010-11-18T08:27:00.000Z	gogeta1	pdg1	well if you have 3 you should hve windoes recover and express gate
2010-11-18T08:27:00.000Z	gogeta1		pdg1:express gate will be like 1gb maybe less
2010-11-18T08:29:00.000Z	gogeta1	pdg1	the safest bet would be to make a recovery dvd in case you did nuke it
2010-11-18T08:29:00.000Z	pdg1	gogeta1	: i have 4. 80GB -windows, 15GB -recovery?, 54.03GB -unsure, and 21MB -notsure
2010-11-18T08:30:00.000Z	gogeta1	pdg1	well recover whont be 54gb thats for shure
2010-11-18T08:30:00.000Z	gogeta1	pdg1	if you have a c and d drive in windows its a storage partation weard for 1 drive thow
2010-11-18T08:32:00.000Z	pdg1	gogeta1	: i was going to consult the manual... but it was pretty useless
2010-11-18T08:32:00.000Z	gogeta1	pdg1	as i said if you show 2 drives in windows 54gb is probly stoage
2010-11-18T08:32:00.000Z	gogeta1		storage
2010-11-18T08:35:00.000Z	gogeta1	pdg1	just odd they did that for windows on a defult install
2010-11-18T08:35:00.000Z	pdg1	gogeta1	sounds like sda2 is my best bet
2010-11-18T08:36:00.000Z	gogeta1	pdg1	well as i said 15gb is more then likely the recovery
2010-11-18T08:36:00.000Z	gogeta1	pdg1	the rest are os
2010-11-18T08:38:00.000Z	gogeta1	pdg1	the 24mb is likely the padding for the drive in case of failed sectors
2010-11-18T08:39:00.000Z	pdg1	gogeta1	: thanks :)
