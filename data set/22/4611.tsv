2007-11-28T06:16:00.000Z	adepthelp		Hello, i need some help with adept notifier, can i ask here?
2007-11-28T06:16:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adepthelp	#kubuntu would probably be a better place
2007-11-28T06:16:00.000Z	adepthelp	MasterShrek	thanks
2007-11-28T06:24:00.000Z	adepthelp	MasterShrek	nobody could help me on #kubuntu (most of them are idle) can i ask here instead? it's a rather simple question
2007-11-28T06:25:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adepthelp	thats not an adept-specific question, its actually for apt-get
2007-11-28T06:28:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adepthelp	there is a way, let me find it for you...
2007-11-28T06:28:00.000Z	adepthelp	MasterShrek	thanks a lot :)
2007-11-28T06:31:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adepthelp	hmm, not finding anything, i cant exaclty remember how it was done, and im ont on ubuntu righ tnow so i cant even look it up, but whats stopping you from just upgrading it?
2007-11-28T06:32:00.000Z	adepthelp	MasterShrek	well i could upgrade.. backup my conf files first but why would i need to do that..
2007-11-28T06:33:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adepthelp	becuase you didnt use checkinstall when you compiled it
2007-11-28T06:34:00.000Z	adepthelp	MasterShrek	if i just download the source of vim 7.0 and do checkinstall, would it work
2007-11-28T06:34:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adepthelp	assuming the version you got from source is >= the version in the repos but youll need to totally recompile it: ./configure && make && checkinstall
2007-11-28T06:34:00.000Z	adepthelp	MasterShrek	cool, thanks
2007-11-28T06:42:00.000Z	adepthelp	MasterShrek	i downloaded the same version, configured and make'd successfully, then did checkinstall and it's still in the software list.
2007-11-28T06:44:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adepthelp	does it disappear after: sudo apt-get update
2007-11-28T06:44:00.000Z	adepthelp	MasterShrek	>_> thanks
2007-11-28T06:45:00.000Z	adepthelp	MasterShrek	sudo apt-get update gives me the following error which is kinda silly: "W: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these problems"
2007-11-28T06:46:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adepthelp	its probably complaining about one or more of your repositories are unavaialbe
2007-11-28T06:46:00.000Z	adepthelp	MasterShrek	is it me or compiling from source seems.. easier? :(
2007-11-28T06:47:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adepthelp	it can be, but dependencies can be a pain in the arse, i run slamd64, so i compile often
2007-11-28T06:48:00.000Z	adepthelp	MasterShrek	okay, then can i select which packages i want from adept, and install them with apt-get or something? i'll just let it complain about vim but i'll install all the others i want
2007-11-28T06:49:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adepthelp	yea u can use apt-get, adept is just a frontend to apt-get
