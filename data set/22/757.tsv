2012-02-25T06:00:00.000Z	nibbler	jeregon	ssh is a pretty good idea for that. do you have a router at home to connect to the internet?
2012-02-25T06:01:00.000Z	jeregon	nibbler	well im talking to you through it LOl
2012-02-25T06:01:00.000Z	nibbler	jeregon	i don't undertand, talkint to me thought what?
2012-02-25T06:02:00.000Z	jeregon	nibbler	how do i know it will allways start even though there has been a power outage?
2012-02-25T06:02:00.000Z	nibbler	jeregon	what?
2012-02-25T06:03:00.000Z	jeregon	nibbler	ok whatever yes i do have a router that connects to the internet and i belive i insyalled open ssh on this server
2012-02-25T06:04:00.000Z	jeregon	nibbler	continue dont mind what i sayd earlier LOL
2012-02-25T06:04:00.000Z	nibbler	jeregon	sorry, now i understood :) well, if you have a router and did not configure port forwards for ssh, then you don'tneed to be scared of hackers, but you'll only be able to be connected to from computers in your local network
2012-02-25T06:04:00.000Z	jeregon	nibbler	sorry to have confused you
2012-02-25T06:05:00.000Z	jeregon	nibbler	 i whant to be able to connect from outside the network
2012-02-25T06:05:00.000Z	jeregon	nibbler	local network
2012-02-25T06:06:00.000Z	nibbler	jeregon	then you ahve to make sure you configure your router to forward port 22 to  your pc - and make sure you have proper passwords on all accounts
2012-02-25T06:07:00.000Z	jeregon	nibbler	ok cool do you mind walking me through the steps on doing this?
2012-02-25T06:08:00.000Z	nibbler	jeregon	as this is 0 ubuntu related, and all routers are sort of different, sorry, no
2012-02-25T06:08:00.000Z	jeregon	nibbler	keep in mind that the computer that i will be using is this one
2012-02-25T06:08:00.000Z	jeregon	nibbler	not the router side but the server side
2012-02-25T06:08:00.000Z	nibbler	jeregon	check your routers manual. on the server side you are done with "sudo aptitude install openssh-server"
2012-02-25T06:09:00.000Z	jeregon	nibbler	hmm
2012-02-25T06:11:00.000Z	nibbler	jeregon	on the client: ssh USER@IP (remote login) or scp /blah/file user@ip:/tmp for filetransfer, or use a client like filezilla
2012-02-25T06:14:00.000Z	jeregon	nibbler	ok cool thakns
2012-02-25T06:15:00.000Z	nibbler	jeregon	if you want to synchronise you might want to look into rsync, works just as scp, but does not transfer stuff that is already there
