2010-08-27T16:53:00.000Z	Oli```		Can anybody suggest how to find out why my Alt+Printscreen isn't working?
2010-08-27T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	Oli```	does just printscreen work?
2010-08-27T16:54:00.000Z	Oli```	jrib	yup
2010-08-27T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	Oli```	is alt-printscreen supposed to grab a window?
2010-08-27T16:54:00.000Z	Oli```	jrib	yeah
2010-08-27T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	Oli```	does the cursor change so you can select a window?
2010-08-27T16:55:00.000Z	Oli```	jrib	it *used* to just grab the output of the current window and pop up a window like normal printscreen does
2010-08-27T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	Oli```	oh, but is that a "no" to my previous question?
2010-08-27T16:56:00.000Z	Oli```	jrib	yeah, I've never had it give me a window-select-style option - even when it worked
2010-08-27T16:57:00.000Z	jrib	Oli```	k, try executing « gnome-panel-screenshot -w » and see if that works
2010-08-27T16:58:00.000Z	Oli```	jrib	both that and gnome-screenshot --window work fine. I say the other command because I've just had a look at my compiz gnome-compat settings and that's what it lists for the window screenshot command.
2010-08-27T16:58:00.000Z	jrib	Oli```	I see
2010-08-27T16:59:00.000Z	Oli```	jrib	it's like something's overriding the keypress because other compiz-set keys are working
2010-08-27T16:59:00.000Z	jrib	Oli```	does it work if you bind it to a different key combination?
2010-08-27T16:59:00.000Z	Oli```	jrib	yes
2010-08-27T17:00:00.000Z	jrib	Oli```	k, well now we know the issue... Maybe try #compiz?  Did it used to work?  What changed?
2010-08-27T17:01:00.000Z	Oli```	jrib	when I try and set it back to <Alt>Print it can't "hear" the key combination. As I say, it's like something else is listening to that event and stopping anything else hear it. Is there any way to see what's responding to a keypress?
2010-08-27T17:01:00.000Z	jrib	Oli```	not that I know of
2010-08-27T17:02:00.000Z	Oli```	jrib	same applies to gnome's own keyboard shortcuts window (can't hear it). I'm in metacity now and the same is happening.
2010-08-27T17:03:00.000Z	jrib	Oli```	check what programs are running
2010-08-27T17:04:00.000Z	jrib	Oli```	you can also create a fresh new user and verify the key shortcut works there, then you would only have to login with the user for which it doesn't work and list running programs by that user
2010-08-27T17:04:00.000Z	Oli```	jrib	good plan. I'll try the guest session
