2005-09-18T12:38:00.000Z	NegativePlazma		Why does everyone in here prefer ubuntu to say other distros like slackware? Im doing some reasearch for a project
2005-09-18T12:39:00.000Z	NegativePlazma		hmm interesting
2005-09-18T12:40:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	NegativePlazma	: desktop is owned by ubuntu, slackware+redhat = servers
2005-09-18T12:39:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	NegativePlazma	: i like slackware, so i run a hybryd ubuntu/slackware. ppl use what suits them best, a hybrid suits me best.
2005-09-18T12:40:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	NegativePlazma	: ubuntu got financial backing for difficult areas.. and it appeals to a bigger market
2005-09-18T12:40:00.000Z	NegativePlazma	lsuactiafner	yea? already?
2005-09-18T12:40:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	NegativePlazma	: but check the most popular distribution is slackware on freshmeat.net
2005-09-18T12:42:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	NegativePlazma	: ubuntu does a shitload of things automatically that really made me angry, like ntpdate, but after you get rid of eyecandy (that most ppl prefer) ect you can make ubuntu work for you with less effort than making slackware work for you
2005-09-18T12:43:00.000Z	NegativePlazma	lsuactiafner	one thing i didnt like that ubuntu out of the box install didnt come with gcc.. but apt took care of it in no time
2005-09-18T12:44:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	NegativePlazma	: also annoyed me, since i'm to linux
2005-09-18T12:45:00.000Z	NegativePlazma	lsuactiafner	yea thats true, but when i started linux all I knew was how to compile from source, i had no clue of binaries so
2005-09-18T12:45:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	NegativePlazma	: and having gcc is good since not everyone has access to the internet..
2005-09-18T12:46:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	NegativePlazma	: in the end it depends on what is best suited for you, every distribution has a ninche market.
2005-09-18T12:47:00.000Z	NegativePlazma	lsuactiafner	yea thats true.. soo many distros theese days
2005-09-18T12:47:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	NegativePlazma	: yeh, apt-get build-dep package also works nicely
2005-09-18T12:47:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	NegativePlazma	: apt-get build-dep mplayer so you can get the CVS instead ect
2005-09-18T12:47:00.000Z	NegativePlazma	lsuactiafner	so can i compile a new kernel from source as well? or do i have to get it through apt
2005-09-18T12:48:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	NegativePlazma	: there is apt kernels
2005-09-18T12:48:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	NegativePlazma	: i prefer making my own kernel+nvidia+mplayer+firefox support still
2005-09-18T12:49:00.000Z	NegativePlazma	lsuactiafner	so you compile your kernel from source?
2005-09-18T12:49:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	NegativePlazma	: always
2005-09-18T12:50:00.000Z	NegativePlazma	lsuactiafner	oh good, cuz that is all i know how to do kernel wise, i was scared i wouldn't be able to
