2011-06-09T18:59:00.000Z	Jacco	deployment	 ask .. :)
2011-06-09T18:59:00.000Z	deployment	Jacco	I'm trying to get a simple smtp service running to send alerts.
2011-06-09T19:00:00.000Z	deployment	Jacco	but when i telnet send i get access denied, not a relay
2011-06-09T19:00:00.000Z	deployment	Jacco	If I use php -a then i can send emails to gmail.com
2011-06-09T19:00:00.000Z	deployment	Jacco	from localhost (same box)
2011-06-09T19:01:00.000Z	Jacco	deployment	so if you telnet you directly get that message?
2011-06-09T19:01:00.000Z	deployment	Jacco	Yep
2011-06-09T19:01:00.000Z	Jacco	deployment	netstat -nlp shows its listening?
2011-06-09T19:03:00.000Z	deployment	Jacco	yeh
2011-06-09T19:03:00.000Z	Jacco	deployment	 whats the mynetworks  option set to in /etc/postfix/main.cf?
2011-06-09T19:04:00.000Z	deployment	Jacco	127.0.0.1/8 ALSO: in testing i added a line mynetworks_style=subnet
2011-06-09T19:05:00.000Z	Jacco	deployment	if postfix listens on the correct IP adresses it should give you output no matter what when you use telnet.. you always should get the ehlo part
2011-06-09T19:05:00.000Z	deployment	Jacco	yeh i do, sorry after that i put in from then to
2011-06-09T19:05:00.000Z	deployment	Jacco	at to it says access denied relay..
2011-06-09T19:06:00.000Z	Jacco	deployment	so you get in to postfix itself.. ok fine.. lets see. Just to be sure.. is localhost still resolved properly? ;)
2011-06-09T19:06:00.000Z	deployment	Jacco	yeh
2011-06-09T19:08:00.000Z	deployment	Jacco	teamviewer !
2011-06-09T19:08:00.000Z	Jacco	deployment	honestly i would fix it in 10 seconds but postfix can be configure in so many ways.. is dpkg-reconfigure postfix an option for you? just to get a basic working relay?
2011-06-09T19:10:00.000Z	deployment	Jacco	i've looked at the configure thing and i still can't get it working.
2011-06-09T19:10:00.000Z	deployment	Jacco	I would give you rdp if you could help. it's in a testlab so i'm sfe
2011-06-09T19:12:00.000Z	deployment	Jacco	RDP fix me?
