2008-05-11T16:20:00.000Z	yusuo		hi, anyone know how to get ubuntu to remember an ssh address, and well basically shorten it
2008-05-11T16:20:00.000Z	yusuo		e.g. someone@192.168.0.1 to someone
2008-05-11T16:21:00.000Z	ak5	yusuo	isn't it /etc/hosts
2008-05-11T16:21:00.000Z	yusuo	ak5	i dont know how would i edit it
2008-05-11T16:21:00.000Z	ak5	yusuo	sudo nano /etc/hosts
2008-05-11T16:22:00.000Z	yusuo	ak5	but how do what is the command i need
2008-05-11T16:23:00.000Z	ak5	yusuo	i just gave you the command
2008-05-11T16:23:00.000Z	ak5	yusuo	open a terminal, then type sudo nano /etc/hosts to edit that file
2008-05-11T16:24:00.000Z	ak5	yusuo	ahh
2008-05-11T16:24:00.000Z	ak5	yusuo	ok you have the file infornt of you?
2008-05-11T16:24:00.000Z	ak5	yusuo	so you see something like 127.0.0.1 localhost
2008-05-11T16:25:00.000Z	ak5	yusuo	 add the ip of whatever you want to shorten then press <tab >
2008-05-11T16:25:00.000Z	ak5	yusuo	then add the shortcut name
2008-05-11T16:25:00.000Z	ak5	yusuo	remember not to use dhcp when relying on this
2008-05-11T16:25:00.000Z	ak5	yusuo	cause that might screw up
2008-05-11T16:26:00.000Z	ak5	yusuo	do root@shorcut
2008-05-11T16:26:00.000Z	ak5	yusuo	or whateverusername@shortcut
2008-05-11T16:27:00.000Z	ak5	yusuo	it works?
2008-05-11T16:27:00.000Z	ak5	yusuo	I'm glad
