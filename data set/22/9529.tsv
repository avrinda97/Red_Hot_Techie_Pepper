2004-11-16T06:27:00.000Z	socomm	LinuxJones	New age music is instrumental, elecltronicmusic such as Enya.
2004-11-16T06:29:00.000Z	LinuxJones	socomm	if you want some old age music try Rush or Iron Maiden :)
2004-11-16T06:29:00.000Z	socomm	LinuxJones	that was just a joke, trying to make fun of mirak in a friendly way.
2004-11-16T06:30:00.000Z	socomm	LinuxJones	Iron Maiden is cool, though rush sucks in my opinion.
2004-11-16T06:30:00.000Z	LinuxJones	socomm	 listen to 2112 for 1 days and realize their brilliance :)
