2006-04-18T10:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	initard	yup
2006-04-18T10:08:00.000Z	initard	apokryphos	how long, do you know?
2006-04-18T10:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	initard	I can't remember if it was actually the case, but I heard launchpad downtime was meant to be two hours.
2006-04-18T10:09:00.000Z	initard	apokryphos	ok, thanks
2006-04-18T10:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	initard	synaptic/apt/dpkg is in use
2006-04-18T10:15:00.000Z	apokryphos	initard	what are you trying to do?
2006-04-18T10:16:00.000Z	apokryphos	initard	what/why?
2006-04-18T10:17:00.000Z	initard	apokryphos	cuz all i have on the other partition is the server installation
2006-04-18T10:18:00.000Z	initard	apokryphos	why, why?  i'm concerned about your concern.
2006-04-18T10:18:00.000Z	apokryphos	initard	why would you have X on another partition? And why wouldn't you just symlink things...
2006-04-18T10:19:00.000Z	initard	apokryphos	cuz i decided to upgrade to dapper on the other part and if it fixes my soundcard/hotplug issues then eventually i'll scrap the breezy partition...why??????
2006-04-18T10:20:00.000Z	apokryphos	initard	you have totally lost me. Why are you moving packages between them?
2006-04-18T10:23:00.000Z	initard	apokryphos	what the hell? are you just toying with me?  I'm putting X on a partition that doesnt have x, THEN i'm going to update that partition to DAPPER DUCK and if that fixes my soundcard/hotplug issues i will use that as my primary desktop and scrap this partition... is there an issue with installing X?  or are you just chronicaly curious about my doings?
2006-04-18T10:24:00.000Z	apokryphos	initard	dapper drake. Why aren't you *in* that other partition, is what I'm saying.
2006-04-18T10:24:00.000Z	apokryphos	initard	I'm curious because it sounds to me like you're doing it in a pretty messy way.
