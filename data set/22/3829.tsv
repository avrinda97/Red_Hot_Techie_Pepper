2008-05-27T10:50:00.000Z	lnar		is it possible to install grub in DVD and make it boot some .iso files burned on the DVD???
2008-05-27T10:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lnar	Why would you want it to boot iso files?
2008-05-27T10:52:00.000Z	lnar	Jordan_U	im tryin to make a dvd with several distros
2008-05-27T10:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lnar	Ahh, there is a better way to do that
2008-05-27T10:53:00.000Z	lnar	Jordan_U	how ?
2008-05-27T10:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lnar	http://www.linux.com/articles/52927 And for future reference it is usually good to state your end goal before you ask a question like that, because you may have many people that can help you but never get an answer to the question you ask :)
2008-05-27T10:56:00.000Z	lnar	Jordan_U	if u find any solution in that page for what im trying to do, Ill give u a million dollars
2008-05-27T10:57:00.000Z	lnar	Jordan_U	none of that works man
2008-05-27T10:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lnar	Maybe I misunderstand what you are trying to do then, because that is an article about how to "make a custom DVD to boot multiple live CDs" unless I gave you the wrong link
2008-05-27T10:59:00.000Z	lnar	Jordan_U	i refers to a script that doesnt exist in the hole internet
2008-05-27T11:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lnar	Ahh, that does pose a problem doesn't it :)
2008-05-27T11:01:00.000Z	lnar	Jordan_U	u have any idea how to do it? have u ever did something like this?
2008-05-27T11:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lnar	You could try the script linked to in the comments of that page, though I don't know how respectable it is
2008-05-27T11:04:00.000Z	lnar	Jordan_U	doesnt exist anymore
2008-05-27T11:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lnar	http://mikukkon.googlepages.com/make_dvd_05.tgz works here
2008-05-27T11:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lnar	Where's my million dollars ? ;)
2008-05-27T11:09:00.000Z	lnar	Jordan_U	it has to work... probable wont because i want to burn different distros than that script lets u
2008-05-27T11:13:00.000Z	lnar	Jordan_U	doesnt work it only works for some distros.... hehe told u
2008-05-27T11:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lnar	Damn, and here I thought I was going to get rich :)
2008-05-27T11:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lnar	For what distros that you need does it not work?
2008-05-27T11:15:00.000Z	lnar	Jordan_U	i want to make a dvd with the ubuntu mandriva fedora gparted
2008-05-27T11:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lnar	I would expect Ubuntu mandrivia and gparted to be layed out basically the same way ( BTW, mandrivia Ubuntu and fedora all contain gparted on their liveCD's so gparted is somewhat redundant )
