2007-10-14T05:07:00.000Z	gogeta		xixaq cant reboot it?
2007-10-14T05:08:00.000Z	XiXaQ	gogeta	no, I don't have permissions to do that.
2007-10-14T05:12:00.000Z	XiXaQ	gogeta	apt-get knows?
2007-10-14T05:14:00.000Z	XiXaQ	gogeta	that's not a problem.. You run a normal apt-get install on the ubuntu system, the application notices which dependencies weren't met and stores it on the usb thing, then you run the application again on windows. It downloads the required packages. Then you run it again on ubuntu, and the software is installed.
2007-10-14T05:14:00.000Z	XiXaQ	gogeta	yes, I know it is, but that's not possible, so ..
2007-10-14T05:15:00.000Z	XiXaQ	gogeta	I know.. ?
2007-10-14T05:15:00.000Z	XiXaQ	gogeta	yes, but I don't have another ubuntu system.. I have a Windows system.
2007-10-14T05:18:00.000Z	XiXaQ	gogeta	no, you can't do that without rebooting.
2007-10-14T05:18:00.000Z	XiXaQ	gogeta	are you sure that will run on all Windows setups, even locked-down ones?
2007-10-14T05:19:00.000Z	XiXaQ	gogeta	Scunizi; but that would in any case be _way_ too heavy. I think I'll write an application for it myself.
2007-10-14T05:21:00.000Z	XiXaQ	gogeta	yes, but that'd be way too heavy in any case.
2007-10-14T05:22:00.000Z	XiXaQ	gogeta	yes, but it'd use way too much resources, and require too much space.
2007-10-14T05:26:00.000Z	XiXaQ	gogeta	no. I think portable python is the way to go.
