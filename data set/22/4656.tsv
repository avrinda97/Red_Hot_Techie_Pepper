2007-11-17T17:30:00.000Z	ere4si	markelhas	what error - the suspense is killing me :)
2007-11-17T17:32:00.000Z	ere4si	markelhas	apologies - didn't notice - seems to be a hardware issue - what is the system you're on?
2007-11-17T17:33:00.000Z	markelhas	ere4si	i've a asus a7n8x nforce2 motherboard
2007-11-17T17:33:00.000Z	ere4si	markelhas	means nothing to me - fairly new?
2007-11-17T17:34:00.000Z	markelhas	ere4si	nopes. i've tested early ubuntu live cd and it boot no problem
2007-11-17T17:35:00.000Z	ere4si	markelhas	obvious question time - did you run the md5 check on the new disk?
2007-11-17T17:35:00.000Z	markelhas	ere4si	but with 7.10 not working any more. I've removed 7.04 because i had a network problem. Now i want to try 7.10 but cant boot live cd :(
2007-11-17T17:35:00.000Z	markelhas	ere4si	yap, and testmem to
2007-11-17T17:36:00.000Z	markelhas	ere4si	also try kubuntu and eduntu, same problem
2007-11-17T17:36:00.000Z	ere4si	markelhas	tomorrow you could just update to 7.10 - todays there's problems
2007-11-17T17:36:00.000Z	markelhas	ere4si	same cd on my laptop works just fine
2007-11-17T17:38:00.000Z	ere4si	markelhas	at the install or boot prompt hit F6 - then type a space then    apci=off   and see if that helps
2007-11-17T17:38:00.000Z	markelhas	ere4si	ok i'll try it. got to go now.
