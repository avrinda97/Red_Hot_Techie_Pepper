2007-02-25T10:59:00.000Z	bruenig	Ironman273	to install gaim 6, do this, copy and paste it all at once: echo "deb  http://repository.debuntu.org/ edgy multiverse" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list && wget http://repository.debuntu.org/GPG-Key-chantra.txt && sudo apt-key add GPG-Key-chantra.txt && rm GPG-Key-chantra.txt && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2007-02-25T11:00:00.000Z	Ironman273	bruenig	it tells me "2 not upgraded" at the end
2007-02-25T11:00:00.000Z	bruenig	Ironman273	ok do sudo apt-get install gaim
2007-02-25T11:18:00.000Z	bruenig	Ironman273	did that gaim thing work
2007-02-25T11:18:00.000Z	Ironman273	bruenig	Yes it did.  Thanks for the help.  Sorry I didn't confirm it before, I started to read stuff and got a little lost in it.
2007-02-25T11:19:00.000Z	bruenig	Ironman273	ok good
2007-02-25T11:30:00.000Z	Ironman273	bruenig	Cool, thanks
2007-02-25T11:22:00.000Z	bruenig	Ironman273	linux is the general name of all the distros based on the linux kernel, ubuntu is based on debian, gnome is a desktop environment that can be run on any distro including ubuntu
2007-02-25T11:23:00.000Z	Ironman273	bruenig	So roughly it's Linux -> Debian -> Ubuntu which can branch out to Gnome or KDE (with kubuntu)?
2007-02-25T11:24:00.000Z	bruenig	Ironman273	yeah, and gnome and kde can go on debian too
2007-02-25T11:25:00.000Z	Ironman273	bruenig	OK, sorry for the dumb questions, I'm just hoping to understand it better.
2007-02-25T11:25:00.000Z	bruenig	Ironman273	no problem
2007-02-25T11:30:00.000Z	bruenig	Ironman273	if you do /msg ubotu firewall (or any other thing) it will tell you in pm
2007-02-25T11:31:00.000Z	Ironman273	bruenig	Do you recommend Firestarter to config the firewall?
2007-02-25T11:31:00.000Z	bruenig	Ironman273	yeah
2007-02-25T11:32:00.000Z	Ironman273	bruenig	It's not in synaptic, how do I get it?
2007-02-25T11:33:00.000Z	bruenig	Ironman273	do "sudo sed 's/# deb/deb/g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install firestarter" make sure you close synaptic before doing that
2007-02-25T11:34:00.000Z	Ironman273	bruenig	Thanks it's installing
2007-02-25T11:35:00.000Z	Ironman273	bruenig	Once it completes, where does it put it?
2007-02-25T11:35:00.000Z	bruenig	Ironman273	it will be in the menus, it might be in system>administration
