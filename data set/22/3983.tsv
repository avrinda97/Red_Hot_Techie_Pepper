2008-05-17T11:33:00.000Z	kajo		I simply want fluxbox & a handful of programs on my computer, nothing more, nothing less. How do I do this most efficiently?
2008-05-17T11:33:00.000Z	SuperQ	kajo	you could install server, and then manually install stuff
2008-05-17T11:34:00.000Z	SuperQ	kajo	are you disk space limited?
2008-05-17T11:34:00.000Z	kajo	SuperQ	is the server CD different from the minimal CD? I have only 6 gigs of HD, old laptop..
2008-05-17T11:35:00.000Z	SuperQ	kajo	I don't think there is a "minimal" anymore
2008-05-17T11:35:00.000Z	kajo	SuperQ	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2008-05-17T11:35:00.000Z	SuperQ	kajo	Oh, that's _really_ minimal
2008-05-17T11:36:00.000Z	kajo	SuperQ	enlighten me on the finer points, please?
2008-05-17T11:36:00.000Z	SuperQ	kajo	Server is a bit bigger, with some more common packages
2008-05-17T11:36:00.000Z	SuperQ	kajo	minimal appears to be literally that.. the most basic set
2008-05-17T11:36:00.000Z	kajo	SuperQ	like what kind of things would be on server that would not be on otherwise?
2008-05-17T11:36:00.000Z	SuperQ	kajo	if you're familiar with Linux stuff, Minimal may be what you want
2008-05-17T11:37:00.000Z	SuperQ	kajo	otherwise, try out xubuntu, which is a lighter-weight full distro
2008-05-17T11:37:00.000Z	SuperQ	kajo	I'm not sure off the top of my head
2008-05-17T11:37:00.000Z	kajo	SuperQ	Ryan- I'm not a poweruser, but all I want is a handful of stuff... ubuntu as it is feels bloated. I do not want Xfce, I want fluxbox, so I don't want xubuntu. I'm considering doing all of that customization, but wondering if that is best.
2008-05-17T11:38:00.000Z	SuperQ	kajo	You can install fluxbox on xubuntu, and then remove xfce
2008-05-17T11:39:00.000Z	kajo	SuperQ	but won't that leave other packages that I won't want, parts of the Xfce operating environment?
2008-05-17T11:39:00.000Z	SuperQ	kajo	well, it will include a lot of packages
2008-05-17T11:40:00.000Z	SuperQ	kajo	yea, go minimal
2008-05-17T11:43:00.000Z	SuperQ	kajo	Minimal CD, then apt-get install fluxbox xorg
2008-05-17T11:44:00.000Z	kajo	SuperQ	thanks. :)
2008-05-17T11:45:00.000Z	SuperQ	kajo	good luck
