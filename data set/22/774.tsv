2011-03-28T08:08:00.000Z	b1lly	ayecee	if i wanted to make them all o+r for the files and folders in it
2011-03-28T08:08:00.000Z	ayecee	b1lly	could you put a whole sentence in a line? that way we don't have to wait for you to finish the sentence.
2011-03-28T08:10:00.000Z	ayecee	b1lly	it depends on the permissions. show the permissions on one of the files with ls -la, as suggested.

2011-03-28T08:12:00.000Z	ayecee	b1lly	the gelberg folder is readable. which file are you trying to access?
2011-03-28T08:14:00.000Z	ayecee	b1lly	because you copied the files as root
2011-03-28T08:16:00.000Z	ayecee	b1lly	something like that, yes.
2011-03-28T09:10:00.000Z	ayecee	b1lly	what happens when you try?
2011-03-28T09:10:00.000Z	b1lly	ayecee	it makes the folder (the ownership is set to www-data), but it doesnt upload the file
2011-03-28T09:11:00.000Z	ayecee	b1lly	what are you using to upload?
2011-03-28T09:12:00.000Z	ayecee	b1lly	what is the cgi that is receiving the upload?
2011-03-28T09:12:00.000Z	b1lly	ayecee	cgi?
2011-03-28T09:12:00.000Z	ayecee	b1lly	yes, cgi. How is your website receiving an upload without a cgi?
2011-03-28T09:14:00.000Z	ayecee	b1lly	so the php script is the cgi then?
