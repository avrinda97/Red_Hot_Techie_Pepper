2008-10-17T23:47:00.000Z	Marupa		Hi everyone, I've got a very weird issue here, that I don't know how to fix.  In windows my CPU fan works just fine, but in linux it never powers down to a near-stop like it does in windows.  It can get louder when there's lots of heat, but not as quiet as it is in windows.  Any suggestions?
2008-10-17T23:48:00.000Z	Suborbital	Marupa	Turn off ACPI at boot (never start it)
2008-10-17T23:49:00.000Z	Marupa	Suborbital	how do you do that?  Bios, or?
2008-10-17T23:50:00.000Z	Suborbital	Marupa	No, with your system startup tool, you click to uncheck the button
2008-10-17T23:50:00.000Z	Marupa	Suborbital	and this will make the fans behave properly?
2008-10-17T23:50:00.000Z	Suborbital	Marupa	System->Administration->Services ?
2008-10-17T23:51:00.000Z	Suborbital	Marupa	Do you have an IBM computer ?
2008-10-17T23:51:00.000Z	Marupa	Suborbital	Not that I know of.
2008-10-17T23:51:00.000Z	Suborbital	Marupa	What do you have ?
2008-10-17T23:53:00.000Z	Marupa	Suborbital	apmd too/
2008-10-17T23:54:00.000Z	Marupa	Suborbital	what exactly will this do?
2008-10-17T23:57:00.000Z	Suborbital	Marupa	update-rc.d -f acpi remove" (or acpid or whatever yould like) ,... first test with shutting it down manually (/etc/init.d/apci stop)
2008-10-17T23:57:00.000Z	Marupa	Suborbital	yes, but what wil it do?
2008-10-17T23:59:00.000Z	Suborbital	Marupa	remove all links to the startup scripts so that they wont be startrted at boot, use "update-rc.d -f acpid default" to start it
2008-10-17T23:59:00.000Z	Marupa	Suborbital	no no.  What will removing ACPI do, exactly?
2008-10-17T23:59:00.000Z	Suborbital	Marupa	it will remiove the startup links, not remove any vital thing you cannot activate again
2008-10-18T00:00:00.000Z	Marupa	Suborbital	you're skirting my question.
2008-10-18T00:00:00.000Z	Suborbital	Marupa	quit bullshitting a coder since 1997
2008-10-18T00:00:00.000Z	Suborbital	Marupa	Either you listen or you dont
2008-10-18T00:00:00.000Z	Marupa	Suborbital	What will disabling ACPI do, exactly?
2008-10-18T00:01:00.000Z	Suborbital	Marupa	Not handle acpi calls
2008-10-18T00:01:00.000Z	Suborbital	Marupa	"Such as 'starrt your fans and run them warm'" etc
