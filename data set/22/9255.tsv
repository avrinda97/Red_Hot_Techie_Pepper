2005-01-17T11:41:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	cosco	i would say thats down to postnuke config
2005-01-17T11:42:00.000Z	cosco	pybe-lappy	i just moved phpnuke there , im trying to vonfigure it , and i dont know why it doesnt work
2005-01-17T11:42:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	cosco	moved what the php & the sql database?
2005-01-17T11:43:00.000Z	cosco	pybe-lappy	i dont get uyou
2005-01-17T11:44:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	cosco	you said you "moved" postnuke here implying it was working somewhere else before
2005-01-17T11:44:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	cosco	you just install it?
2005-01-17T11:45:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	cosco	ok, you setup sql with dbase and users yet?
2005-01-17T11:45:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	cosco	sounds like you need to read the install docs that came with phpnuke
2005-01-17T11:47:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	cosco	why cant you edit it?
2005-01-17T11:47:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	cosco	you edit the file with a text editor on the machine
2005-01-17T11:48:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	cosco	you cant edit a file through a web browser
2005-01-17T11:48:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	cosco	gedit or nano the file on your computer
2005-01-17T11:49:00.000Z	cosco	pybe-lappy	it askes me root password , but on ubunt , it will cant login becase root mode is disable it can only login as root with sudo su
2005-01-17T11:49:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	cosco	you will probably need to have created a database and users with the correct rights etc in mysql. You might whant to find phpmysql to do that for you.
2005-01-17T11:50:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	cosco	sudo passwd
2005-01-17T11:54:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	cosco	there will some install docs that tell you a whole lot more than you pasted just now
2005-01-17T11:54:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	cosco	you there still
