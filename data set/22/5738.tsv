2007-03-10T09:51:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff		dpkg: unable to access dpkg status area: Read-only file system
2007-03-10T09:51:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff		that is the error that dpgk gives.
2007-03-10T09:51:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff		Yes
2007-03-10T09:51:00.000Z	voidmage	SnakesAndStuff	that's not good
2007-03-10T09:51:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff		I think the hard drive controller fsked up my stuff honestly
2007-03-10T09:51:00.000Z	voidmage	SnakesAndStuff	your filesystem is mounted as read only, that means you had an error
2007-03-10T09:51:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff		when I killed it and brought it back up it wouldn't see my SATA drive.
2007-03-10T09:52:00.000Z	voidmage		what i would try is rebooting to recovery mode and fscking
2007-03-10T09:52:00.000Z	voidmage		anyone else think that's a good idea?
2007-03-10T09:52:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff	voidmage	This install is only 2 days old... Honestly I might just reinstall from CD...
2007-03-10T09:52:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff	voidmage	Think that might give me a better chance of cleaning things up?
2007-03-10T09:52:00.000Z	voidmage	SnakesAndStuff	if you've really screwed things up that's probably a better idea
2007-03-10T09:52:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff		I've already backed everything up on my other box.
2007-03-10T09:53:00.000Z	voidmage		maybe then a simple reboot would fsck
2007-03-10T09:53:00.000Z	voidmage		so i might try that
2007-03-10T09:53:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff		tried that
2007-03-10T09:53:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff		Anyway... Thanks for the help, I do appreciate it...
2007-03-10T09:53:00.000Z	voidmage		hmm, well i'd either fsck in recovery mode or reinstall
2007-03-10T09:53:00.000Z	voidmage		because somehow i think you really screwed something up
2007-03-10T09:54:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff	voidmage	Probably so... it hard locked on me during a software update...
2007-03-10T09:54:00.000Z	SnakesAndStuff		and when it booted back up it wasn't seeing the drive at all in BIOS... had to unplug everything and let it sit before it'd see it
2007-03-10T09:54:00.000Z	voidmage	SnakesAndStuff	if you have all your home stuff backed up and know what packages you would need to reinstall
