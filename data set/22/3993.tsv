2008-10-27T11:48:00.000Z	bullgard4		I cannot orient myself in '.config - Linux Kernel v2.6.24.3 Configuration' Where would I find there the line CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y?
2008-10-27T11:49:00.000Z	ay^	bullgard4	just search for it?
2008-10-27T11:49:00.000Z	bullgard4	ay^	What do you mean by "just search"?
2008-10-27T11:50:00.000Z	ay^	bullgard4	well, in most apps you can search inside a file for stuff
2008-10-27T11:50:00.000Z	ay^	bullgard4	just open the file in a texteditor that can, if this is a textfile which I assume
2008-10-27T11:51:00.000Z	bullgard4	ay^	Excellent! I am speaking about a program and not a file.
2008-10-27T11:51:00.000Z	ay^	bullgard4	okay, then what program? or is the program called ".config"
2008-10-27T11:52:00.000Z	ay^	bullgard4	or am I tlaking to the wrong person here? (goes checking)
2008-10-27T11:53:00.000Z	bullgard4	ay^	The program's name is '.config - Linux Kernel v2.6.24.3 Configuration'. I have clearly stated that in my question at the outset.
2008-10-27T11:54:00.000Z	ay^	bullgard4	hehe, you don't expect me to know the name of every program ever written, do you? To me that seems like the .config file for a kernel. Anyhows, good luck ;)
2008-10-27T11:54:00.000Z	bullgard4	ay^	Enjoy Ubuntu!
2008-10-27T11:55:00.000Z	ay^	bullgard4	yeah.. That I am.
2008-10-27T12:05:00.000Z	ay^	bullgard4	are you in th dir of the .confg?
2008-10-27T12:05:00.000Z	bullgard4	ay^	Just a moment. Checking ...
2008-10-27T12:06:00.000Z	ay^	bullgard4	else as I said, open the .config in a texteditor such as gedit or vim, there you can search for that line
2008-10-27T12:08:00.000Z	ay^	bullgard4	have you installed the sources?
2008-10-27T12:10:00.000Z	bullgard4	ay^	I have installed the DEB program packages 'linux-source' and 'linux-source-2.6.24'.
2008-10-27T12:13:00.000Z	ay^	bullgard4	I don't really know what you are trying to do, so maybe I should stop helping you :)
2008-10-27T12:15:00.000Z	ay^	bullgard4	for that command to work, you need to be in the folder where your .config file is
2008-10-27T12:21:00.000Z	ay^	bullgard4	the terminal?
2008-10-27T12:22:00.000Z	ay^	bullgard4	what do you mean by the console?
2008-10-27T12:28:00.000Z	ay^	bullgard4	what exactly are you doing dude?
