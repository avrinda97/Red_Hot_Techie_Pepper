2007-10-27T11:23:00.000Z	PurpZeY		Can any suggest a reason why I'd switch to Gutsy, if I have feisty installed and working w/ compiz?
2007-10-27T11:24:00.000Z	scguy318	PurpZeY	not really, if it aint broke don't fix it :P
2008-01-02T11:29:00.000Z	PurpZeY	scguy318	You sure?
2008-01-02T11:30:00.000Z	scguy318	PurpZeY	well, didnt turn up when I did apt-cache search
2008-01-02T11:30:00.000Z	scguy318	PurpZeY	there are debs for it actually
2008-01-02T11:31:00.000Z	PurpZeY	scguy318	I don't believe in debs
2008-01-02T11:31:00.000Z	scguy318	PurpZeY	using a different distro I suppose?
2008-01-02T11:31:00.000Z	PurpZeY	scguy318	I think we can all learn to do sudo make install ./configure...not rocket science and helpful to learn
2008-01-02T11:32:00.000Z	scguy318	PurpZeY	dependency hell :P
2008-01-02T11:32:00.000Z	PurpZeY	scguy318	But, this is the way people learn
2008-01-02T11:32:00.000Z	scguy318	PurpZeY	about?
2008-01-02T11:32:00.000Z	PurpZeY	scguy318	About *nix.
2008-01-02T11:33:00.000Z	PurpZeY	scguy318	If I never compiled, I'd have never learned about dependencies and all of that type stuff
2008-01-02T11:33:00.000Z	PurpZeY	scguy318	Maybe one day we will be beyond that, but at this point I see linux as not only an O/S but a tool to learn
2008-01-02T11:33:00.000Z	scguy318	PurpZeY	ok, cool I guess
2008-01-02T11:38:00.000Z	scguy318	PurpZeY	no, don't think so
2008-01-02T11:47:00.000Z	PurpZeY	scguy318	My recollection is that he is trying to avoid that
2008-01-02T11:50:00.000Z	scguy318	PurpZeY	apparently no Vietnamese channel either, heh
2008-01-02T12:01:00.000Z	scguy318	PurpZeY	not really simple :P like Photoshop vs. MS Paint :P
2008-01-09T06:12:00.000Z	scguy318	PurpZeY	Samba does the job too, but NFS is preferred in native *nix environment
2008-01-09T06:13:00.000Z	PurpZeY	scguy318	is NFS GUI? would it enable me to read the files of the NTFS partition...e.g. to play my mp3s?
2008-01-09T06:13:00.000Z	scguy318	PurpZeY	as GUI as Samba :P
