2007-12-02T02:54:00.000Z	juano__	marina	well then, first of all you have to go to System ----> Administration ----> Restricted drivers
2007-12-02T02:55:00.000Z	juano__	marina	in there you should enable the restricted driver for your ati card
2007-12-02T02:55:00.000Z	juano__	marina	thats a first step
2007-12-02T03:00:00.000Z	juano__	marina	ok now what drivers are listed in restricted ?=

2007-12-02T03:02:00.000Z	juano__	marina	is that the only entry for the video card ?
2007-12-02T03:02:00.000Z	juano__	marina	or is there another driver for that video card ?
2007-12-02T03:03:00.000Z	juano__	marina	ok, after enabling if you restart X it should be in use
