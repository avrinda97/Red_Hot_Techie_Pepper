2005-04-05T09:56:00.000Z	robl^		gnome?!?!  I use GNUstep :)
2005-04-05T09:57:00.000Z	maxchee	robl^	how is gnustep?
2005-04-05T09:59:00.000Z	maxchee	robl^	I though gnustep (the framework) is still under dev
2005-04-05T10:00:00.000Z	robl^	maxchee	yes.  so is Mac OS X. :)  but GNUstep is useable.  there are always new versions..  same with any other software
2005-04-05T10:00:00.000Z	maxchee	robl^	and are there any gnustep apps?
2005-04-05T10:01:00.000Z	maxchee	robl^	other than windowmaker (which is not even using the framework)
2005-04-05T10:01:00.000Z	robl^	maxchee	a fair number.. and as of recently, more and more Mac OS X are being ported to GNUstep
2005-04-05T10:02:00.000Z	robl^	maxchee	irc clients, email, filemangers, editors, IM clients, games, etc.  Even OpenGroupware.org uses GNUstep
2005-04-05T10:03:00.000Z	maxchee	robl^	performance?
2005-04-05T10:03:00.000Z	maxchee	robl^	also does gnustep have a DE?
2005-04-05T10:03:00.000Z	robl^	maxchee	performs as least as well KDE or GNOME.  DE?  Desktop Environment?  or Development?
2005-04-05T10:04:00.000Z	maxchee	robl^	Desktop environment
2005-04-05T10:04:00.000Z	robl^	maxchee	yes, to a degree.  Its pretty much the same as the old Openstep DE
2005-04-05T10:06:00.000Z	robl^	maxchee	hoary here. :)
2005-04-05T10:07:00.000Z	maxchee	robl^	using firefox?
2005-04-05T10:07:00.000Z	robl^	maxchee	yeah
2005-04-05T10:09:00.000Z	robl^	maxchee	looks to be "default firefox"
2005-04-05T10:09:00.000Z	maxchee	robl^	ie. bright green back button of winstripe, right?
2005-04-05T10:09:00.000Z	robl^	maxchee	yeah.  Firefix *default) 2.0
2005-04-05T10:11:00.000Z	maxchee	robl^	I think both are okay. Although the subdued colour of the gnome theme fits better in gnome
2005-04-05T10:15:00.000Z	robl^	maxchee	that's just it.. not everyone has the same goals or prefers to work in a certain style.  gnome vs kde vs cde vs gnustep, etc..  no one single *right* answer for everyone :)
2005-04-05T10:16:00.000Z	maxchee	robl^	which is why I leave the end of the sentence off.
