2007-12-14T23:42:00.000Z	Zero4k		Hey now, just about every windows issue that I've run across, can be fixed by reinstalling drivers / reconfiguring the problem software, and doesn't involve me spending two hours at a command line. But I don't want to get into the *nix versus windows debate right now. :P
2007-12-14T23:44:00.000Z	Zero4k		I'll admit, my problem is that I love my GUI's, and linux utterly flunks when it comes to a good GUI that is akin to windows.
2007-12-14T23:44:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	I have felt the same way
2007-12-14T23:45:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	Until I really took the time to read all the man pages, not I can't much tollerate any GUI, ESPECIALLY windows
2007-12-14T23:45:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	not = now*
2007-12-14T23:48:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	Unfortunately any time you have a GUI, you have sacrafices. Many tools have WAY too many arguments that could be passed to make anything that looked half way descent.
2007-12-14T23:50:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	for example, a GUI that passed kernel arguments. The number of flaws exist there. Usually at any point kernel arguments need to be passed, graphical interface is unavailable. Also, there are 2-3 common optional arguments that are passed, but there are hundreds. Additionally, modular support for a command is easy to implement on a command line, where as a GUI must be completly rewritten
2007-12-14T23:53:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	Well, that is exactly the issue. What happens when you need those optional components. Btw, if this is all surrounding gnome configuration, then you want KDE
2007-12-14T23:53:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	Actually, you would likely prefer KDE in general. it is all about bringing a windows like feel to Linux. I would, but I am alergic
2007-12-14T23:55:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	Don't you have to remember what the GUI does, or how it works in order to get it to work too? I feel like most of the command line / "edit this text file" stuff in Linux is stuff you just can't do in windows
2007-12-14T23:55:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	??? That is because AD is poor. NFS is way better in terms of security, reliability, and flexibility
2007-12-14T23:56:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	The issue is that nfs can be used a million different ways, not just as an active directory
2007-12-14T23:58:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	Gothfunc: Well, he is in this forum, so he certaintly wants to see the light... but I know what it is like to come from flatland... I mean windows
2007-12-14T23:59:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	Noone makes it to this channel without having potential
2007-12-15T00:02:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	What exactly, for example, did you like about AD that you want to do in Linux?
2007-12-15T00:04:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	you are familiar with /home, correct?
2007-12-15T00:07:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	well, it is like a combination of the Documents and Settings folder in windows, but with things arranged fairly differently. In Linux, which I just did recently, is have one machine with a directory that is going to store everything about each user, think a universal home directory. You can then add to each computers fstab "/"theserver" /home nfs defaults 0 0", or mount -t nfs "theserver" /home...
2007-12-15T00:09:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	Now each time a user is created, it is (nearly) available for every computer. sure /etc could be mounted via NFS, but I would recommend against it, unless you have a different NFS /etc directory for each exact hardware configuration. there is too much hardware specific stuff in /etc
2007-12-15T00:10:00.000Z	Zero4k	adelie	I have no idea what you just said, in your last two messages. Those commands are like greek to me. :P
2007-12-15T00:14:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	I would recommend against buying books, just because the material is usually out dated by the time they get published. There are better guides, or new features that make things easier
2007-12-15T00:29:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	Ahen!
2007-12-15T00:29:00.000Z	adelie	Zero4k	Amen!*
