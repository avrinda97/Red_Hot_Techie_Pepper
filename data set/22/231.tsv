2012-03-08T11:41:00.000Z	Zimm3r	Fyodorovna	yes
2012-03-08T11:43:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	Zimm3r	to go outside of your releases version not sure. Have you just run a update upgrade and are you sure that is the problem?
2012-03-08T11:43:00.000Z	Zimm3r	Fyodorovna	well that is what
2012-03-08T11:44:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	Zimm3r	they should tell you how if they are going to advise that I would think, never seen that asked before myself.

2012-03-08T11:47:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	Zimm3r	for whatever release your running. Maybe if you told us the problem it would be more helpful.
2012-03-08T11:47:00.000Z	Zimm3r	Fyodorovna	when I load a media file and then load another the wrong position is returned by gstreamer
2012-03-08T11:49:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	Zimm3r	do you mean a video is not starting where you left off?
2012-03-08T11:49:00.000Z	Zimm3r	Fyodorovna	no that if i load say a mp3 and then load another and immediatly play then pause the wrong time position is given
