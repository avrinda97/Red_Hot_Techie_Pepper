2007-12-16T17:44:00.000Z	ArseneLupin		so i cant edactly tell you
2007-12-16T17:45:00.000Z	ArseneLupin		stefg:i used the gutsy live cd ,defore ,and it captured my different partions (before i make the changes with gparted ) ,if tath can help
2007-12-16T17:45:00.000Z	ArseneLupin		ok stefg :how can i fix that?
2007-12-16T17:46:00.000Z	ArseneLupin		stefg:the partions are seen with the live cd ,i can mount them
2007-12-16T17:46:00.000Z	ArseneLupin		but when i i pass to installation ,the partions program sees only the whole disk
2007-12-16T17:48:00.000Z	Filled-Void	ArseneLupin	Have you already formatted everything as ext3 , swap, ntfs . Cause I dont think ntfs will show up by default you might want to confirm this and your swap wont show either
2007-12-16T17:48:00.000Z	ArseneLupin		the problem is that when i pass to installation ,i choose manual partionning  ,but i only see the whole disk ,i can't see the edt3 and swap partions that i made with gparted
2007-12-16T17:49:00.000Z	ArseneLupin	Filled-void	: yes i did ,but the problem is that when i boot on the live cd ,i can see the partions and chenge them if i wan ,but when i pass to installation (the partions are no longer there)
2007-12-16T17:50:00.000Z	Filled-Void	ArseneLupin	and you are choosing the manual method of disk partitining when yuo do that correct?
2007-12-16T17:51:00.000Z	ArseneLupin		yes
2007-12-16T17:51:00.000Z	ArseneLupin		yes Filled-void
2007-12-16T17:51:00.000Z	ArseneLupin		ubotu:i can view them and modify them outsid the installation program
2007-12-16T17:54:00.000Z	ArseneLupin		so i guess there is no solution here
2007-12-16T17:55:00.000Z	Filled-Void	ArseneLupin	Someone is having the same problem you do to but there isnt a solution for him posted lation live
