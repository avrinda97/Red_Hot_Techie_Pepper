2005-11-06T12:04:00.000Z	MaTaKs	dr_willis	how?
2005-11-06T11:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	MaTaKs	 the mame roms can be in several plaes. the mame config file lists where they look. each user can have their own config files. try .xmame/roms
2005-11-06T12:03:00.000Z	MaTaKs	dr_willis	how can i resize the scree.. it's so small
2005-11-06T12:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	MaTaKs	 xmame has like 1000+ command line options.
2005-11-06T12:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	MaTaKs	 you want to set the scale - may want to get a xmame front end. Or set it to do fullscreen
2005-11-06T12:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	MaTaKs	 xmame --help for the options. or edit the xmame config file  /etc/xmame/xmamerc
2005-11-06T12:05:00.000Z	MaTaKs	dr_willis	ok thnx man
2005-11-06T12:13:00.000Z	MaTaKs	dr_willis	to resize the screen which one will i edit?
2005-11-06T12:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	MaTaKs	 this is when you start reading and learning. :P  because if you set it to say do 3x scaling for ONE game.. then it may mess up other games. However
2005-11-06T12:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	MaTaKs	 the "Hightscale" and other scale settings are a # to scale the game by.
2005-11-06T12:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	MaTaKs	 i dont see the full screen optionmentioned however Hmm.. shouldbe in there somewhere
