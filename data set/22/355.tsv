2011-11-27T21:19:00.000Z	teddie		hm, maybe i should give unity another try.. how long did it take most people? i gave up after a few days as i received anxiety attacks like i was trapped in a coffin which took so long to open the lid of when i needed to i feared suffocation
2011-11-27T21:21:00.000Z	lunitik	teddie	Unity is really very nice, utilize the win key as much as possible  :)
2011-11-27T21:21:00.000Z	lunitik	teddie	it really isn't so different from old gnome2 though... just with a side docky and gnome-do all included in a single interface
2011-11-27T21:22:00.000Z	teddie	lunitik	I suppose it's the way windows are grouped into a thumbnail.. i have to set windows 7 to not do that too. is it possible in unity?
2011-11-27T21:23:00.000Z	lunitik	teddie	it is task oriented instead of window oriented... it is actually pleasant if you get used to it... less clutter about the place
2011-11-27T21:25:00.000Z	lunitik	teddie	fwiw, alt+<button above tab> will go through open windows for a given task...
2011-11-27T21:26:00.000Z	lunitik	teddie	also, stopping on one task in alt+tab will open up all the windows for that tab and arrow keys will let you pick one...
2011-11-27T21:27:00.000Z	teddie	lunitik	i really want 1-click access to any running window though :( although I understand the concept, which is similar to how android works.. but i have a huge resolution monitor, i dont care about clutter :p
2011-11-27T21:28:00.000Z	lunitik	teddie	not caring about clutter doesn't mean its a good design decision to have clutter
2011-11-27T21:28:00.000Z	lunitik	teddie	Unity is about preserving pixels everywhere it can... if you prefer a mess, try KDE perhaps?
2011-11-27T21:29:00.000Z	lunitik	teddie	it isn't more difficult, it is just more organized
2011-11-27T21:29:00.000Z	teddie	lunitik	i agree it's better for casual users
2011-11-27T21:29:00.000Z	lunitik	teddie	it isn't only for casual users, it is also better for power users because you don't have to remember where you put things
2011-11-27T21:30:00.000Z	lunitik	teddie	I really suggest losing your stubbornness and just giving it a decent shot... granted I was one of those trying to get it working when it was still only for netbooks but it just makes things cleaner
2011-11-27T21:31:00.000Z	teddie	lunitik	okay! they say it takes a month to get used to something
2011-11-27T21:32:00.000Z	lunitik	teddie	do so, once you get used to the workflow it is a pure joy... it is just that your workflow patterns haven't really changed in so long you do not even want them improved now
2011-11-27T21:32:00.000Z	teddie	lunitik	exactly.. i hate feeling like a newbie at my computer again
2011-11-27T21:32:00.000Z	lunitik	teddie	just remember, the winkey is your friend... even holding it pick a favorite app (those on the side)
2011-11-27T21:34:00.000Z	lunitik	teddie	protip: if you have multiple apps in the side pane, holding winkey and hitting its respective number shows you all open windows of just that app in a expose like display
2011-11-27T21:35:00.000Z	lunitik	teddie	multiple open windows for apps in the*
2011-11-27T21:35:00.000Z	teddie	lunitik	okay Thanks I will give it a try !
2011-11-27T21:35:00.000Z	lunitik	teddie	winkey is really your friend in unity, I cannot stress it enough  :P
