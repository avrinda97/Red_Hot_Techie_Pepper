2009-06-04T09:33:00.000Z	YesImaLinuxN00B	froes	do you have drivers for your video installed?
2009-06-04T09:34:00.000Z	froes	YesImaLinuxN00B	yeap .. it is regular intel driver
2009-06-04T09:36:00.000Z	YesImaLinuxN00B	froes	is there a panel where you can configure your resolution, maybe theres a setting thats not right
2009-06-04T09:37:00.000Z	froes	YesImaLinuxN00B	it is configured, but everytime i boot and the resolution ios wrong things wont work properly i think. even my mobile dongle
2009-06-04T09:39:00.000Z	YesImaLinuxN00B	froes	i dont really know what to say then. I am still learning the ins and outs of ubuntu myself. sorry
2009-06-04T09:40:00.000Z	YesImaLinuxN00B		how do i remove a package and all of its dependencies
2009-06-04T09:41:00.000Z	froes	YesImaLinuxN00B	only wn i compile the kernel i can get it to work properly
2009-06-04T09:42:00.000Z	YesImaLinuxN00B		ok thanx
2009-06-04T09:43:00.000Z	YesImaLinuxN00B		fores: you had to compile your own kernel to get your video to work
2009-06-04T09:43:00.000Z	YesImaLinuxN00B	froes	you had to compile your own kernel to get your video to work
2009-06-04T09:44:00.000Z	froes	YesImaLinuxN00B	nope. havent got the time to recompile the kernel yet.
2009-06-04T09:45:00.000Z	froes		i am more used to slackware, then i really dont know a lot about this ubuntu
2009-06-04T09:45:00.000Z	YesImaLinuxN00B	froes	oic. that could be the reason for the odd resolutions then. I was stuck with 640x480 until i compiled my own kernel with a patch
