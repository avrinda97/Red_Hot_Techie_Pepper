2008-09-16T03:53:00.000Z	unop	timo	the command i gave you deletes every file in the current directory except the one named home
2008-09-16T03:54:00.000Z	unop	timo	to delete directories  shopt -s extglob; rm -r !(home)
2008-09-16T03:55:00.000Z	unop	timo	i guess you know what you are doing here - because if you are running this command in / - there is no going back
2008-09-16T03:55:00.000Z	unop	timo	yes, if you are a normal user and want to delete files you do not own
2008-09-16T03:57:00.000Z	unop	timo	did you use sudo ?
2008-09-16T03:58:00.000Z	unop	timo	no.   shopt -s extglob; sudo rm -r !(home)
