2010-10-19T14:37:00.000Z	gp5st		so what's the best way to get it? use an old repo?
2010-10-19T14:37:00.000Z	gp5st		it = libstdc++.so.5
2010-10-19T14:38:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	gp5st	I just got that file by using sudo apt-get install libstdc++-5

2010-10-19T14:39:00.000Z	gp5st	bobthemilkman	i'm on 10.04
2010-10-19T14:39:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	gp5st	Oh sorry, libstdc++5

2010-10-19T14:41:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	gp5st	By any chance, are you attempting to install icc?
2010-10-19T14:42:00.000Z	gp5st	bobthemilkman	use, not install:(
2010-10-19T14:42:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	gp5st	http://packages.ubuntu.com/en/jaunty/libstdc++5 Try to download and install that.
2010-10-19T14:43:00.000Z	gp5st	bobthemilkman	thanks
2010-10-19T14:44:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	gp5st	I'm actually trying to install icc myself. I literally installed that package on my 10.10 system about 15 seconds before you asking about it.
2010-10-19T14:44:00.000Z	gp5st	bobthemilkman	what sucks is that i only really need ifort because i can't get this one prog to compile with gcc, but i've never had luck mixing compilers
2010-10-19T14:45:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	gp5st	I've had the exact same problem with gfortran. I resolved it by installing gcc-3.4.  I'm now installing icc/ifort because I want my code to run faster.
2010-10-19T14:46:00.000Z	gp5st	bobthemilkman	it's not even faster it's just at all.  so i dpkg -i that deb file and i get the same thing; did it work for you?
2010-10-19T14:48:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	gp5st	Actually, I downloaded 2 packages. First I downloaded libstdc++6-4.5-dev and then libstdc++5.  It made the icc installation program quit complaining about not finding libstdc++.so.5.
2010-10-19T14:52:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	gp5st	I am a bit concerned about the glibc version that icc seems to want to use.  It says it only wants v2.3, .4, .5, or .6, but I seem to have 2.12 installed.
2010-10-19T14:53:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	gp5st	So that might also be a problem you have.
2010-10-19T14:53:00.000Z	gp5st	bobthemilkman	for me it's always wanted very old versions
2010-10-19T14:56:00.000Z	gp5st	bobthemilkman	well, before I would just install the old lib
2010-10-19T15:07:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	gp5st	I can tell you that I've successfully installed icc, and then written, compiled, and executed helloworld.c with it.
2010-10-19T15:07:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	gp5st	So I have a feeling you should also be able to do your task with the aforementioned libraries and your current version of glibc.  However, you might run into other problems down the road.
