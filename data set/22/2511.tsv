2009-05-26T20:47:00.000Z	ed_debian	fanno	Well if you don't plan on booting vista ever again then it really doesn't matter
2009-05-26T20:48:00.000Z	ed_debian	fanno	You can get your data off the ntfs (windows partition) you just need to configure a little and get a package.  Yes have you ever used linux before?
2009-05-26T20:49:00.000Z	fanno	ed_debian	well i have not used linux as a desktop, i have a qnap file storage server with linux on it. thats about it
2009-05-26T20:50:00.000Z	ed_debian	fanno	What is qnap?
2009-05-26T20:50:00.000Z	fanno	ed_debian	this one : http://www.qnap.com/pro_detail_feature.asp?p_id=79
2009-05-26T20:51:00.000Z	ed_debian	fanno	It's a brand!  lol  not an acronym
2009-05-26T20:51:00.000Z	fanno	ed_debian	sorry =/
2009-05-26T20:51:00.000Z	ed_debian	fanno	So the question is.  Do you want to boot vista again after you install ubuntu?  (That's ok you didn't do anything wrong)
2009-05-26T20:52:00.000Z	fanno	ed_debian	no i dont really care. the vista has a 30 day trail period anyway i only have one lisence
2009-05-26T20:52:00.000Z	ed_debian	fanno	O, have fun with ubuntu then!
2009-05-26T20:53:00.000Z	fanno	ed_debian	thats why i wanna install linux =), i was toled that ubunto was one of the more easy ones
2009-05-26T20:53:00.000Z	ed_debian	fanno	Eh, that's all subjective
2009-05-26T20:54:00.000Z	fanno	ed_debian	indeed it is, i am a programmer and work with c++ and php ect but not a pro by long shot
2009-05-26T20:54:00.000Z	ed_debian	fanno	Some people think though that linux mint holds you by the hand to much and you don't learn anything.
2009-05-26T20:59:00.000Z	fanno	ed_debian	you know if there is a command to bypass "searctinh file mirror" ?
2009-05-26T20:59:00.000Z	ed_debian	fanno	the system is searching the file mirror because it needs to download files.  You cannot have files if you don't download them :(
2009-05-26T21:00:00.000Z	fanno	ed_debian	but what is it it need to download ? this mean i cant install ubunto on a pc without internet '?
2009-05-26T21:01:00.000Z	ed_debian	fanno	Are you installing from a full live CD?
2009-05-26T21:02:00.000Z	fanno	ed_debian	from here http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
2009-05-26T21:02:00.000Z	fanno	ed_debian	not sure if thats is a live cd or not
2009-05-26T21:05:00.000Z	ed_debian	fanno	Well if you have an alternate install CD you need an internet connection and you can't boot to a desktop before installing the OS.  With a live CD you can install from the CD with no connection and you can boot to a desktop without installing the OS first
