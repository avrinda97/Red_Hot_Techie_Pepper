2008-01-14T01:00:00.000Z	wOzza		My problem is as follows..I have a SMB network hard drive. I can see the shares if I use network lookup. but for some reason I cannot mount the share. I want to use Amarok but I guess it needs a mnt to build the collection. I get the following. sudo mount //192.168.2.74/music  /media/music/ -o username=XXXX,password=XXX,dmask=777,fmask=777
2008-01-14T01:00:00.000Z	wOzza		mount: Not a directory....  Any suggestions?
2008-01-14T01:00:00.000Z	realmer	wOzza	smbmount
2008-01-14T01:01:00.000Z	wOzza	realmer	so should the command be sudo smbmount ?
2008-01-14T01:02:00.000Z	realmer	wOzza	try
2008-01-14T01:02:00.000Z	realmer	wOzza	depends how your stuff is configured
2008-01-14T01:03:00.000Z	wOzza	realmer	I get smbmount: command not found.
2008-01-14T01:03:00.000Z	realmer	wOzza	you could also try mount -t smbfs
2008-01-14T01:03:00.000Z	realmer	wOzza	or mount -t cifs
2008-01-14T01:06:00.000Z	wOzza	realmer	both mount -t smbfs and cifs give the error mount: Not a directory. this is the command I used. sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.2.74/music /media/music/ -o username=XXXXX,password=XXX,dmask=777,fmask=777
2008-01-14T01:07:00.000Z	realmer	wOzza	hmm have you created /media/music dir?
2008-01-14T01:07:00.000Z	wOzza	realmer	yes I have.
2008-01-14T01:08:00.000Z	realmer	wOzza	install smbclient and try this
2008-01-14T01:10:00.000Z	realmer	wOzza	smbclient //share/mount -username=user -p
2008-01-14T01:11:00.000Z	realmer	wOzza	then you can see if smblcient can access this share at all
2008-01-14T01:11:00.000Z	wOzza	realmer	i can access the share every whch way. but just cannot mount it for some bizare reason.
2008-01-14T01:12:00.000Z	realmer	wOzza	try to mount it in your home directory, maybe some kind of permission problem
2008-01-14T01:12:00.000Z	wOzza	realmer	smb share on a network attached hard drive.
2008-01-14T01:13:00.000Z	wOzza	realmer	I can view the share from nautilus and dolphin ect...
2008-01-14T01:14:00.000Z	wOzza	realmer	what is the command I should have in fstab?
2008-01-14T01:51:00.000Z	wOzza	realmer	Duke_Fluke. Got it working thanx. found out I didnt have SMBFS installed. all fixed now thanx again.
2008-01-14T01:52:00.000Z	realmer	wOzza	no problem
