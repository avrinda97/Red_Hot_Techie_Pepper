2008-05-30T21:18:00.000Z	arakthor		anyone here set up a webserver on ubuntu? I'm looking for some help regarding default mail directories using postfix/courier/postfixadmin
2008-05-30T21:18:00.000Z	_zo	arakthor	what does webserver have to do with postfix?
2008-05-30T21:18:00.000Z	arakthor	_zo	I'm sorry, I meant mailserver
2008-05-30T21:19:00.000Z	_zo	arakthor	did you read all the wiki pages?
2008-05-30T21:19:00.000Z	arakthor	_zo	yessir
2008-05-30T21:20:00.000Z	_zo	arakthor	whats the problem then?
2008-05-30T21:20:00.000Z	arakthor	_zo	I want to have a "Spam" folder initially available to all users added to the system - right now there is only Sent,Inbox,Trash
2008-05-30T21:21:00.000Z	_zo	arakthor	so your mailserver works you just want a global spam folder?
2008-05-30T21:21:00.000Z	arakthor	_zo	yes, or a per user spam folder (I may be misunderstanding global)
2008-05-30T21:22:00.000Z	_zo	arakthor	global would be one spam folder for every user...per user is well, per user
2008-05-30T21:22:00.000Z	arakthor	_zo	then, yes, global
2008-05-30T21:23:00.000Z	_zo	arakthor	I think you can create a global folder and name it whatever you want, are you looking for a spam filter to go with your mailserver? if so thats a different issue
2008-05-30T21:23:00.000Z	arakthor		 _zo: I already have filtering for spam and viruses set up. just need the folder
2008-05-30T21:24:00.000Z	_zo		!postfix
2008-05-30T21:25:00.000Z	_zo	arakthor	whata bout this page? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostfixCompleteVirtualMailSystemHowto
2008-05-30T21:26:00.000Z	arakthor	_zo	no :s
2008-05-30T21:27:00.000Z	_zo	arakthor	no? no you haven't checked it? or no you don't want to, or no its not going to help?
2008-05-30T21:27:00.000Z	arakthor	_zo	already been through it several times
2008-05-30T21:27:00.000Z	_zo	arakthor	ah
2008-05-30T21:28:00.000Z	arakthor	_zo	unfortunately, the ubuntu wiki is rather incomplete, so I have managed to put together my own how-to, at least for my company, and I may consider updating the wiki with what I have found
2008-05-30T21:29:00.000Z	_zo	arakthor	best bet is http://www.postfix.org/lists.html
2008-05-30T21:30:00.000Z	arakthor	_zo	ok, thank you very much
