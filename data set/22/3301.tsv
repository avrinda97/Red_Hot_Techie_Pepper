2008-10-28T07:03:00.000Z	Randal1	scunizi	whatever info u need to figure out what is wrong
2008-10-28T07:04:00.000Z	scunizi	Randal1	sounds like SeaPhor might be able to guide you better.. I wouldn't know where to start
2008-10-28T07:04:00.000Z	Randal1	scunizi	thanks for trying :)
2008-10-28T07:05:00.000Z	scunizi	Randal1	np.. wish I could have helped more.
2008-10-28T07:11:00.000Z	scunizi	Randal1	you have to mount the drive in the live cd to do that then you have to find the mount point to copy the xorg to.
2008-10-28T07:12:00.000Z	scunizi	Randal1	SeaPhor sometimes it's easier not to use the live cd.. just go to Places/File system and look in /etc/X11/ for an older copy.. If it was done automatically it will be dated.. just copy that back to xorg.conf
2008-10-28T07:14:00.000Z	scunizi	Randal1	SeaPhor also you could just install ibex now since it's in RC and do the daily updates..
2008-10-28T07:14:00.000Z	Randal1	scunizi	RC?
2008-10-28T07:15:00.000Z	scunizi	Randal1	SeaPhor one thing to do on a reinstall is to make sure you create a seperate /home partition for all your date.. that way if you really mess things up and need to reinstall you can without loosing all your data.. I experienced that in the last week with a failed harddrive.
2008-10-28T07:15:00.000Z	scunizi	Randal1	RC=release candidate.. it's the release just before the official release with most of the bugs worked out.
2008-10-28T07:48:00.000Z	scunizi	Randal1	don't do update.. do a reinstall.
2008-10-28T07:48:00.000Z	Randal1	scunizi	how would i do that?
2008-10-28T07:49:00.000Z	scunizi	Randal1	download the new iso and burn it.. put it in the cd rom and restart the machine.. on boot it will have an install button after getting to the gui
2008-10-28T07:50:00.000Z	Randal1	scunizi	so don't do it through update manger? and i won't lose files or have to repartition?
2008-10-28T07:51:00.000Z	scunizi	Randal1	if you currently have a seperate /home partition then no you won't if you don't format it as part of the install.. if your /home is part and parcel with your root directory now then you'll loose it unless you move it before installing.
2008-10-28T07:51:00.000Z	Randal1	scunizi	ok
2008-10-28T07:53:00.000Z	scunizi	Randal1	maybe.. open synaptic and go to edit then choose Fix Broken Packages
2008-10-28T07:58:00.000Z	scunizi	Randal1	try again after closing synaptic
2008-10-28T07:59:00.000Z	Randal1	scunizi	all i have open is update manager? and it won't really close
2008-10-28T07:59:00.000Z	scunizi	Randal1	that's what you need to close
