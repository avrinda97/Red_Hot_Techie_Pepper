2006-10-13T06:19:00.000Z	libervisco		Any musicians here?
2006-10-13T06:19:00.000Z	Samuli^	libervisco	yes.
2006-10-13T06:20:00.000Z	libervisco		What sequencer do you use?
2006-10-13T06:20:00.000Z	libervisco		I wanted to try Dino, but it requires a newer jack than in Dapper
2006-10-13T06:20:00.000Z	Samuli^	libervisco	pro tools :)
2006-10-13T06:21:00.000Z	libervisco	Samuli^	pro tools?
2006-10-13T06:21:00.000Z	Samuli^	libervisco	for linux only thing good is ardour and is not a sequencer.. yet.
2006-10-13T06:21:00.000Z	libervisco		ah
2006-10-13T06:22:00.000Z	libervisco	Samuli^	well I happen to know some other things that are good, I'm just looking for a suitable sequencer :)
2006-10-13T06:22:00.000Z	Samuli^	libervisco	yeah, not on my ubuntu box though. There is no good sequencer for linux as far as I know. You might try rosegarden though, see if it suits your needs.
2006-10-13T06:22:00.000Z	Samuli^	libervisco	good is a subjective thing :)
2006-10-13T06:22:00.000Z	libervisco	Samuli^	yeah, tried Rosegarden and I'll probably play with it more, but Dino sounds better suited
2006-10-13T06:23:00.000Z	Samuli^	libervisco	but really, I don't feel that you'll find anything as good as you can get on windows until ardour gets its act together and pulls out sequencer support.
2006-10-13T06:24:00.000Z	libervisco	Samuli^	watch me ;)
2006-10-13T06:24:00.000Z	libervisco	Samuli^	I'm not going back to windows no matter what :D
2006-10-13T06:33:00.000Z	Samuli^	libervisco	still there?
2006-10-13T06:33:00.000Z	libervisco	Samuli^	yeah
2006-10-13T06:33:00.000Z	Samuli^	libervisco	admirable attitude, dude :)
2006-10-13T06:34:00.000Z	libervisco		hehe thanks Samuli^
