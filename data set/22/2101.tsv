2010-10-14T21:55:00.000Z	sandking		hi
2010-10-14T21:55:00.000Z	sandking		anyone can suggest fan/heat mintoring app?
2010-10-14T21:56:00.000Z	sandking		since i installed 10.10 i feel that my netbook runs a little noisier with fans
2010-10-14T21:57:00.000Z	i2v8an	sandking	what about pae kernel in notebook version?
2010-10-14T21:58:00.000Z	sandking	i2v8an	sorry, i'm not geeky enough to understand that :]
2010-10-14T21:58:00.000Z	sandking		in system monitor i don't see anything using my cpu, but the fans keep rolling :/
2010-10-14T21:59:00.000Z	i2v8an	sandking	pae: physical address extension: almost as good as 64bit 4gb < ram support.  netbook installer installed it by default on my machine
2010-10-14T22:00:00.000Z	sandking	i2v8an	but you used netbook edition, or standard?
2010-10-14T22:00:00.000Z	i2v8an		netbook
2010-10-14T22:00:00.000Z	sandking	i2v8an	in other words - can i just add it now?
2010-10-14T22:00:00.000Z	sandking	i2v8an	i was before using mint on 10.04 ubuntu and it was cooler then
2010-10-14T22:01:00.000Z	i2v8an		that's funny because as soon as I installed 10.10 my fans are actually running at the right time
2010-10-14T22:02:00.000Z	sandking	i2v8an	bun can i add this pae now?
2010-10-14T22:03:00.000Z	i2v8an	sandking	you might already have it.
2010-10-14T22:03:00.000Z	sandking	i2v8an	how can i check it?
2010-10-14T22:04:00.000Z	i2v8an	sandking	uname -r.  if it says -generic-pae then you already have it
2010-10-14T22:04:00.000Z	sandking	i2v8an	generic
2010-10-14T22:04:00.000Z	sandking		:/
2010-10-14T22:05:00.000Z	sandking	i2v8an	somebody said that netbook edition was all about gui
2010-10-14T22:05:00.000Z	sandking		now it seems that it's also about kernel
2010-10-14T22:06:00.000Z	i2v8an	sandking	it should use the same kernel as the standard version.  I have had to install the pae kernel myself in the past
2010-10-14T22:06:00.000Z	sandking	i2v8an	oh. ok, thx anyway - got to go
