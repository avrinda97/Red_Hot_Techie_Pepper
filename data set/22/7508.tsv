2008-03-01T22:49:00.000Z	vignesh		how to i download the repositories into my local hard drive so that i can distribute it to my friends through LAN..??
2008-03-01T22:50:00.000Z	vignesh		yeah.. but still i have a fast interenet connection @ home, my frenz dont have it... so i need to download them..
2008-03-01T22:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	vignesh	there is a program in synaptic that will allow you to create a repository on a cd, but I've forgotten the name.  You'll have problems downloading all the things in the repos. it's thousands of packages.
2008-03-01T22:51:00.000Z	vignesh	Scunizi	cant i download them to an external hard disk??
2008-03-01T22:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	vignesh	sure you can.. but you want ALL of the packages?
2008-03-01T22:52:00.000Z	vignesh	Scunizi	no not all.. but how to i find specific repos alone.??
2008-03-01T22:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	vignesh	I think what asking is how to find the repos and download what you want directly right? if so you can do that via the command line using apt
2008-03-01T22:54:00.000Z	vignesh	Scunizi	nope.. im not askin abt downloadin and installin them in mine.. im asking about downloading and givin it to my frenz thru lan.. coz my frenz dont have direct internet access..
2008-03-01T22:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	vignesh	I understand.. apt will still download without installing them on your machine. You'll then be able to copy the .deb files to the external hd
2008-03-01T22:55:00.000Z	vignesh	Scunizi	oh is that so?? can u plz explain step by step.. coz am a very much newbie..
2008-03-01T22:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	vignesh	I'm not great with apt at the command line.. open a terminal and type man apt.. there's more info there. you can also try info apt
