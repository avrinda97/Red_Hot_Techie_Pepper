2008-05-27T18:05:00.000Z	mancmatt	ePax	i've tried the instructions in the link with no success
2008-05-27T18:06:00.000Z	ePax	mancmatt	Do you have your restricted drivers enabled?
2008-05-27T18:06:00.000Z	mancmatt	ePax	i am now following these instructions: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=4308023&postcount=6
2008-05-27T18:06:00.000Z	mancmatt	ePax	no, i'm attempting to install via the command line as per the instructions in the link above
2008-05-27T18:07:00.000Z	ePax	mancmatt	First of all check if you have your restricted drivers enabled for ati. It should install latest working drivers for your ati card.
2008-05-27T18:07:00.000Z	mancmatt	ePax	i've tried using the restricted drivers management, but it didn't work for my card
2008-05-27T18:08:00.000Z	mancmatt	ePax	it installed some drivers, but they messed up my display and still don't allow me to run at correct resolution
2008-05-27T18:08:00.000Z	mancmatt	ePax	so i searched the forums, and found those instructions which seemed to work better for some people
2008-05-27T18:09:00.000Z	ePax	mancmatt	Ati cards can be painfull to install in any linux inclusive ubuntu. Do you got any error or?
2008-05-27T18:10:00.000Z	mancmatt	ePax	no errors using restricted drivers manager, just a messed up display
2008-05-27T18:10:00.000Z	mancmatt	ePax	the error i get with this guide i found in the forums is: Data incomplete in file xorg.conf Device section "Configured Video Device" must have a Driver line. aticonfig: Parsing the configuration file failed.
2008-05-27T18:11:00.000Z	ePax	mancmatt	google and see what modes your graphic card supports. I think that your refresh rate is not as it should be.
2008-05-27T18:11:00.000Z	mancmatt	ePax	already done, the mode and refresh were correct at 1680x1050:60Hz, but it was still just blindly outputting 1280x1024
2008-05-27T18:11:00.000Z	ePax	mancmatt	Driver name should be "ati" "radeon"
2008-05-27T18:12:00.000Z	ePax	mancmatt	As i said driver name should be ati or radeon
2008-05-27T18:13:00.000Z	mancmatt	ePax	is that in "Monitor" or "Screen"?
2008-05-27T18:13:00.000Z	mancmatt	ePax	or both?#
2008-05-27T18:14:00.000Z	ePax	mancmatt	I hink its in bouth. Before you start messing with xorg.conf do one copy of the file wich kinda works. cp xorg.conf xorg.conf-copy in case you really mess up.
2008-05-27T18:15:00.000Z	mancmatt	ePax	how do i edit xorg.conf? I'm trying to edit in nano but it says it can't save it
2008-05-27T18:16:00.000Z	ePax	mancmatt	You have to have root access to be able to edit xorg. Do as erUSUL told you.
2008-05-27T18:17:00.000Z	ePax	mancmatt	But do one copy of your xorg.
