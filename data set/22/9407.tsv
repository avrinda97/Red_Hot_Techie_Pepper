2005-08-04T06:16:00.000Z	holycow	nothingsometing	look under places, there is a connect to server icon ... select that and setup whatever type of connection you need
2005-08-04T06:16:00.000Z	holycow	nothingsometing	also under places there is anetwork browser icon, samab is installed by default, you should be able to browse to your windows network and open up shares
2005-08-04T06:19:00.000Z	holycow	nothingsometing	your running swat on ubuntu?
2005-08-04T06:19:00.000Z	holycow	nothingsometing	you don't need to you know
2005-08-04T06:19:00.000Z	holycow	nothingsometing	more specifically what do you want to setup, ftp server on linux?  windows style shares on linux?
2005-08-04T06:21:00.000Z	holycow	nothingsometing	sudo apt-get install proftpd is the quickest and easiest way, but it is ftp
2005-08-04T06:21:00.000Z	holycow	nothingsometing	you can also install a streaming server, there are a few of those, icecast is one i think
2005-08-04T06:33:00.000Z	holycow	nothingsometing	there is no ftpd that i know of that has a gui on linux
2005-08-04T06:35:00.000Z	holycow	nothingsometing	wishfull thinking halfway through your samba frustration
2005-08-04T06:55:00.000Z	holycow	nothingsometing	you dont need a gui, just install proftpd, and create a unix user
2005-08-04T06:58:00.000Z	holycow	nothingsometing	no
2005-08-04T06:58:00.000Z	holycow	nothingsometing	probably webmin yes, no one bothers to write guis for linux stuff mostly becase in the end its 20 times the workd for little gain
