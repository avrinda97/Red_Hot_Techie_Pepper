2008-05-06T19:50:00.000Z	simmerz		why does heron's appearance settings window no longer have "custom", under "none","normal" and "extra"?
2008-05-06T19:50:00.000Z	bazhang	simmerz	you need the 3d drivers
2008-05-06T19:50:00.000Z	simmerz	bazhang	erm, I'm running compiz fine
2008-05-06T19:52:00.000Z	bazhang	simmerz	then it is not there apparently
2008-05-06T19:52:00.000Z	simmerz	bazhang	which prevents me from using ccsm from changing settings as it seems that it reverts itself back
2008-05-06T19:53:00.000Z	bazhang	simmerz	which drivers installed
2008-05-06T19:53:00.000Z	simmerz	bazhang	fglrx
2008-05-06T19:54:00.000Z	bazhang	simmerz	best to ask that in #compiz-fusion really
2008-05-06T19:54:00.000Z	simmerz	bazhang	found this: http://tombuntu.com/index.php/2008/03/27/custom-compiz-effects-in-ubuntu-804/
2008-05-20T06:10:00.000Z	bazhang	simmerz	the second
2008-05-20T06:11:00.000Z	simmerz	bazhang	ok. any reason 3.0 was put in as a beta?
2008-11-23T21:43:00.000Z	bazhang	simmerz	using what tool
2008-11-23T21:44:00.000Z	simmerz	bazhang	tried using the intrepid tool in system -> admin
2008-11-23T21:45:00.000Z	bazhang	simmerz	what size usb stick
2008-11-23T21:45:00.000Z	simmerz	bazhang	4G
2008-11-23T21:47:00.000Z	simmerz	bazhang	actually, I think it gives a different error. I was using unetbootin to make the last one. still doesn't boot though.
2008-11-23T21:47:00.000Z	bazhang	simmerz	you have bios set to boot from usb?
2008-11-23T21:48:00.000Z	simmerz	bazhang	yep
2008-11-23T21:49:00.000Z	simmerz	bazhang	trying again with the usb stick creator
2008-11-23T21:49:00.000Z	simmerz	bazhang	should boot on a different laptop right? it's not trying to use the kernel on the hard drive, is it?
2008-11-23T21:50:00.000Z	bazhang	simmerz	should not be, no
2008-11-23T21:50:00.000Z	simmerz	bazhang	mind you. doesn't boot on the same laptop as I made it on anyway
