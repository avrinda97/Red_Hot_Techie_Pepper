2007-02-21T10:16:00.000Z	IcemanV9	kazim59x	gotcha :)
2007-02-21T10:16:00.000Z	kazim59x	IcemanV9	that command hardlocked my system apt-cache policy dbus... couldnt Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Z, could not login from another tty
2007-02-21T10:17:00.000Z	kazim59x	IcemanV9	one more error did i notice while booting.. "File system seems to be mounted readonly, skipping journal replay" & Filesystem not clean
2007-02-21T10:17:00.000Z	IcemanV9	kazim59x	odd. that command has nothing to do with dbus :(
2007-02-21T10:18:00.000Z	kazim59x	IcemanV9	i know... this all i happening since i installed csh... even strange
2007-02-21T10:18:00.000Z	IcemanV9	kazim59x	did you update something OR install something that messed up your "perfect" system?
2007-02-21T10:18:00.000Z	kazim59x	IcemanV9	i installed csh... gave some echo command... and it hardlocked
2007-02-21T10:18:00.000Z	IcemanV9	kazim59x	ah. maybe that's why. csh could be the problem.
2007-02-21T10:19:00.000Z	kazim59x	IcemanV9	i just installed csh.. thats when my system hardlocked first time...
2007-02-21T10:19:00.000Z	kazim59x	IcemanV9	but its just the shell... and not the default shell too
2007-02-21T10:19:00.000Z	kazim59x	IcemanV9	should i apt-get remove csh?
2007-02-21T10:19:00.000Z	IcemanV9	kazim59x	i understand that, but something ain't right with csh
2007-02-21T10:20:00.000Z	kazim59x	IcemanV9	i m going to remove csh... hope i dont have to reboot again (hang?)
2007-02-21T10:20:00.000Z	IcemanV9	kazim59x	yea. needs to find out the problem is. :)

2007-02-21T10:22:00.000Z	kazim59x	IcemanV9	apt-get has stopped after "Reading package lists... 0%"
2007-02-21T10:23:00.000Z	kazim59x	IcemanV9	apt-get may equally be the problm... do u know where is apt-get's log?
2007-02-21T10:23:00.000Z	IcemanV9	kazim59x	in /var/log
2007-02-21T10:23:00.000Z	kazim59x	IcemanV9	by what name? didnt find it
2007-02-21T10:25:00.000Z	IcemanV9	kazim59x	hmm. i don't know. ha. i use aptitude all the time. i don't use apt-get since breezy. aptitude has log (aptitude) in /var/log
