2005-09-21T14:13:00.000Z	JWoods		Hi all.  I just installed Breezy Beaver and I'm having a problem with the panel at the bottom of the screen.
2005-09-21T14:13:00.000Z	JWoods		None of my applications are showing up in the panel.
2005-09-21T14:13:00.000Z	p0windah	JWoods	reboot
2005-09-21T14:15:00.000Z	JWoods		one other note about my panel problem... I imported my home directory from my other machine that was running Warty Warthog.  Would that have any effect on my current panel settings?
2005-09-21T14:15:00.000Z	p0windah	JWoods	did you just upgrade to breezy ?
2005-09-21T14:16:00.000Z	JWoods		No, its a fresh install on a new machine.  I tar-ed up my home dir from another machine and ftp-ed it over and untar-ed it.
2005-09-21T14:16:00.000Z	p0windah	JWoods	who owns the files in /home/user/ now ?
2005-09-21T14:17:00.000Z	JWoods		warty was the latest release when I installed on my old machine.  Never upgraded to hedgehog or beaver.
2005-09-21T14:17:00.000Z	JWoods		root owns the tarball, but I own my home directory and all the files/dirs underneath.
2005-09-21T14:18:00.000Z	p0windah		double check permissions and software versions
2005-09-21T14:18:00.000Z	p0windah		and if it all matches, check again :)
2005-09-21T14:18:00.000Z	JWoods	p0windah	how do I check software versions?
2005-09-21T14:19:00.000Z	p0windah		it'd be faster to tar up what you need and move that across
2005-09-21T14:20:00.000Z	JWoods	p0windah	maybe I'll do that.  what specific dirs do I *not* need?
2005-09-21T14:20:00.000Z	JWoods		or what dirs should I not overwrite?
2005-09-21T14:22:00.000Z	p0windah	JWoods	well I would simply copy the files you have downloaded or specifically authored(openoffice, images)
2005-09-21T14:22:00.000Z	p0windah	JWoods	unless you have some bookmarks you *must* retain, then copying all the .xxx settings across is going to cause grief
2005-09-21T14:23:00.000Z	JWoods	p0windah	can I just reinstall the panel using the package manager?
2005-09-21T14:23:00.000Z	JWoods		will that fix things or will there be other stuff that's messed up?
2005-09-21T14:24:00.000Z	p0windah	JWoods	well if your new machine is working, and its apps are all working. simply adding a openoffice, movie, mp3 and images into your home directory wont cause any problems
2005-09-21T14:25:00.000Z	p0windah	JWoods	copy configuration files from one computer to another, where the software installed and its versions are not exactly the same is bound to have problems
2005-09-21T14:26:00.000Z	JWoods	p0windah	yeah, I did include all the .* dirs from my home directory.  I haven't run into any problems other than the panel (yet).  I'm thinking that reinstalling the panel should fix things.  No?
