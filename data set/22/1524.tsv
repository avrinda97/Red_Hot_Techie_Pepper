2010-09-22T00:11:00.000Z	tripelb		Ubuntu install stalls during "starting up the partitioner" at 43% -- oh please help!!
2010-09-22T00:11:00.000Z	ulziibuyan	tripelb	are you able to use vt?
2010-09-22T00:12:00.000Z	tripelb	ulziibuyan	 I dont know what that means, "vt"
2010-09-22T00:12:00.000Z	ulziibuyan	tripelb	server install?
2010-09-22T00:14:00.000Z	ulziibuyan	tripelb	try either one of Alt-F1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9. one of them should give you a installation log
2010-09-22T00:15:00.000Z	ulziibuyan	tripelb	hopefully
2010-09-22T00:15:00.000Z	tripelb	ulziibuyan	at what point do I "try this" -- should I have it install without the "quiet"?  (I'm a noob a tiny step up)
2010-09-22T00:16:00.000Z	tripelb	ulziibuyan	what do I look for in the log?
2010-09-22T00:16:00.000Z	ulziibuyan	tripelb	you could try when the install hangs
2010-09-22T00:17:00.000Z	ulziibuyan	tripelb	so that you could investigate what went wrong
2010-09-22T00:17:00.000Z	tripelb	ulziibuyan	will I have to copy the log by hand? Or can I put it on the USB drive? When I see it what do I do? -- yes it is to investigate -- but I dont know how to interpret it.
2010-09-22T00:19:00.000Z	ulziibuyan	tripelb	does ubuntu recognize your harddisk?
2010-09-22T00:20:00.000Z	tripelb	ulziibuyan	it didnt complain.
2010-09-22T00:20:00.000Z	tripelb	ulziibuyan	with the server install on a USB I dont get a choice of starting ubuntu up.
2010-09-22T00:21:00.000Z	tripelb	ulziibuyan	you mean a CD install? yes. as I mentioned - gparted quits unexpectedly.
2010-09-22T00:23:00.000Z	ulziibuyan	tripelb	perhaps you should try running gparted from a terminal and see if it complains prior quiting
2010-09-22T00:24:00.000Z	ulziibuyan	tripelb	btw, are you able to see your windows partition when you're on liveCD?
2010-09-22T00:25:00.000Z	tripelb	ulziibuyan	I'll go try to make sure that a liveCD will see the drive. I believe it will. I'll see if liveCD will start the partitioner on another IDE drive. I have never been able to install Ubuntu on this computer. I have used those liveCD's to install Ubuntu on other computers. --- OK I'll reun gparted from a terminal. Never done that. In fact, I thought gparted was the gui version of parted. I'm so beginner. I made that assumption
2010-09-22T00:25:00.000Z	ulziibuyan	tripelb	you are able to come online from liveCD?
2010-09-22T00:25:00.000Z	tripelb	ulziibuyan	this might help the VT question. The computer is 2004. I have a SATA drive and an IDE drive on it.
2010-09-22T00:26:00.000Z	tripelb	ulziibuyan	yes live CD works fine AFAIK until I start the install or the partitioner. (so far so good)
2010-09-22T00:26:00.000Z	ulziibuyan	tripelb	could you come online from the liveCD? so that i could try to help.
