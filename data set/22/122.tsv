2012-06-19T06:44:00.000Z	tomatosalad		uh, hello, i seem to be having issues dual booting a mac running OSX Lion and ubuntu
2012-06-19T06:46:00.000Z	tomatosalad		is there a method to dual-boot Lion and Ubuntu? Refit is kinda...deprecated
2012-06-19T06:46:00.000Z	tomatosalad		and I've been trying for 48 hours
2012-06-19T06:47:00.000Z	tomatosalad		So you have to use a different EFI manager
2012-06-19T06:48:00.000Z	tomatosalad		and every time i try to install Ubuntu
2012-06-19T06:48:00.000Z	tomatosalad		it says "Missing Operating System"
2012-06-19T06:48:00.000Z	tomatosalad		I've tried writing the boot loader to different partitions
2012-06-19T06:48:00.000Z	tomatosalad		i've synched and not-synched the GPT & MBR
2012-06-19T06:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tomatosalad	You should write the boot sector to the MBR.
2012-06-19T06:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tomatosalad	And you should not have a hybrid MBR at all.
2012-06-19T06:50:00.000Z	tomatosalad	Jordan_U	Can you give me an idea of what I should do, then?
2012-06-19T06:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tomatosalad	I would use gdisk to convert from a hybrid mbr back to "pure" GPT, then install grub to the mbr (after making an BIOS Boot Parititon, Ubuntu's installer will make such a partition by default when installing to GPT using automatic partitioning).
2012-06-19T06:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tomatosalad	I don't understand what you're saying. Could you try to be more clear?
2012-06-19T06:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tomatosalad	Installing from the +mac iso, burned to a CD, is the easiest way to install Ubuntu to an intel mac.
2012-06-19T07:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tomatosalad	Could you pastebin the output of "sudo parted -l"?
2012-06-19T07:07:00.000Z	tomatosalad	Jordan_U	and now, i couldn't, wifi card needs drivers
2012-06-19T07:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tomatosalad	I have.
2012-06-19T07:43:00.000Z	tomatosalad	Jordan_U	i am still failing
2012-06-19T07:48:00.000Z	tomatosalad	Jordan_U	is the installer good enough to just plop in a CD and partition on mac?
2012-06-19T07:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tomatosalad	Yes. Though now that you've created a hybrid MBR, I would get rid of that (using gdisk) before running the Ubuntu installer.
2012-06-19T07:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tomatosalad	"reset" how?
2012-06-19T07:57:00.000Z	tomatosalad	Jordan_U	are you busy or are you willing to walk me through when I hit obstacles?
