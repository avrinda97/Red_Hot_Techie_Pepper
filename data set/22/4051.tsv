2008-05-31T23:43:00.000Z	Crewsr3		I'm ready to install hardy and I was hoping someone could help me with my parition set up
2008-05-31T23:43:00.000Z	MrObvious	Crewsr3	Sure!
2008-05-31T23:43:00.000Z	MrObvious	Crewsr3	How big of a space do you have available for Ubuntu?
2008-05-31T23:44:00.000Z	MrObvious	Crewsr3	Hint: type mro and push Tab on the keyboard and it will finish typing my  nickname and highlight it for me to see your posts easier.
2008-05-31T23:44:00.000Z	Crewsr3	MrObvious	Thanks
2008-05-31T23:45:00.000Z	Crewsr3	MrObvious	should I give the boot partition 20 gigs or more?
2008-05-31T23:45:00.000Z	MrObvious	Crewsr3	I would partition / for 20 gigs, swap for 512MB (or more if you don't have much RAM), and the rest for /home. Perhaps you might create a /backup and make the /home 80GB and the backup partition for regular backups.
2008-05-31T23:45:00.000Z	MrObvious	Crewsr3	20GB is plenty. You can get by with 10 but 20 will prevent problems later on.
2008-05-31T23:45:00.000Z	Crewsr3	MrObvious	I will give the os 20 gigs
2008-05-31T23:45:00.000Z	MrObvious	Crewsr3	Is this a server or a desktop?
2008-05-31T23:45:00.000Z	Crewsr3	MrObvious	I have four gigs of ram, but I was still thinking of having a swap
2008-05-31T23:46:00.000Z	MrObvious	Crewsr3	You need one. I would make it 256MB since you have 4GB. Also you would want to run a 64 bit version.
2008-05-31T23:46:00.000Z	Crewsr3	MrObvious	I'm worried about going 64 because of driver and software support
2008-05-31T23:47:00.000Z	MrObvious	Crewsr3	Most of the stuff I run has good 64 bit support. All the drivers run fine.
2008-05-31T23:47:00.000Z	Crewsr3	MrObvious	I'm on fiesty right now and the os can only see 3 gigs, but I'm fine with that
2008-05-31T23:48:00.000Z	Crewsr3	MrObvious	Thank so much, would you recommend that I set up the partitions before run the install or do it with the install disk?
2008-05-31T23:48:00.000Z	MrObvious	Crewsr3	They even made it so Flash works with 64 bit Firefox. It takes a little reading but you can get everything to work from searching wiki.ubuntu.com, the factoids on the ubotu bot, and ubuntuforums.org.
2008-05-31T23:50:00.000Z	MrObvious	Crewsr3	I have no problems with 64 bit.
2008-05-31T23:51:00.000Z	Crewsr3	MrObvious	Should I set up the partitions before I run the install disk or during the install?
2008-05-31T23:51:00.000Z	MrObvious	Crewsr3	I think during the install is fine.
2008-05-31T23:51:00.000Z	Crewsr3	MrObvious	Thanks for your help!!!  Here is goes!   Bye
2008-05-31T23:51:00.000Z	MrObvious	Crewsr3	In fact if you do any partition resizing through GParted, you will need to do it from the LiveCD.
