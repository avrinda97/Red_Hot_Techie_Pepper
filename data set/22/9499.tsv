2007-08-18T13:24:00.000Z	Master_Z		ok guys
2007-08-18T13:24:00.000Z	Master_Z		I switched to alsamixer, made sure nothing was unmuted, and set everything to max
2007-08-18T13:24:00.000Z	Master_Z		and I still have no sound
2007-08-18T13:24:00.000Z	Master_Z		anything else that might get my sound to work?
2007-08-18T13:25:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	; and you have only one card in the pc?
2007-08-18T13:26:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	; what does lspci | grep audio tell you?
2007-08-18T13:29:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	type dmesg , and see if there is an reference to your audio card somewhere in there
2007-08-18T13:29:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	; long list ( dont paste it here )
2007-08-18T13:31:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	; maybe you know what type of card it is ( on the motherboard i presume )
2007-08-18T13:36:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	; is this an macbook?
2007-08-18T13:37:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	: its a long list to go through...
2007-08-18T13:40:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	: i am googling to find an solution, did you try that too?
2007-08-18T13:41:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	: i actually found your post too http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-500759.html
2007-08-18T13:43:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	: it really needs an expert to set it up, any friend that uses linux you can call on?
2007-08-18T13:47:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	?
2007-08-18T13:49:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	 : here is one final thing to try : Run gnome-volume-control by clicking applications then sound and video then volume control. Now click edit, preferences, scroll to the through (should be at the bottom) and look for External Amplifier, click it, click close. A new tab will appear in volume control called Swithes, your sound should now work if not make sure all the options in Playback are high and unmuted
2007-08-18T13:50:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	: yes
2007-08-18T13:51:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	: then tab preferences
2007-08-18T13:51:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	: its in there eternal amp
2007-08-18T13:52:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	: its empty?
2007-08-18T13:53:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	: hmm, that sounds like an modem with soundchip
2007-08-18T13:54:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Master_Z	: well, its to complicated, you will have to try, and find an expert, with more knowledge then me, sorry i could not get it up and making sound...:)
