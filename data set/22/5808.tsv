2007-03-03T17:42:00.000Z	Narqulie		Um.. What am I supposed to do now? : -- checking for gcc... gcc
2007-03-03T17:42:00.000Z	Narqulie		checking whether the C compiler (gcc  ) works... no
2007-03-03T17:42:00.000Z	Narqulie		configure: error: installation or configuration problem: C compiler cannot create executables.
2007-03-03T08:03:00.000Z	Narqulie		Hey.. I keep getting this weird Gcc error when I'm trying to ./configure anything.. What should I do?
2007-03-03T08:03:00.000Z	raven3x7	Narqulie	you got build-essential installed?
2007-03-03T08:05:00.000Z	raven3x7	Narqulie	sudo apt-get built-essental
2007-03-03T08:05:00.000Z	raven3x7	Narqulie	sudo apt-get built-essential
2007-03-03T08:06:00.000Z	raven3x7	Narqulie	that should install gcc because ubuntu does not install it by default
2007-03-03T08:17:00.000Z	raven3x7	Narqulie	apt-get python-devel i think
2007-03-03T08:18:00.000Z	raven3x7	Narqulie	what are you trying to build anyway
2007-03-03T08:21:00.000Z	raven3x7	Narqulie	for anything that is in ubuntu repo you can also do apt-get built-dep program
2007-03-03T08:24:00.000Z	raven3x7	Narqulie	err sorry apt-get build-dep program
2007-03-03T08:24:00.000Z	Narqulie	raven3x7	Still not making too much sense tbh :))
2007-03-03T08:24:00.000Z	raven3x7	Narqulie	that will fetch all build dependencies, at leat for the version in ubuntu repos
2007-03-03T08:25:00.000Z	Narqulie	raven3x7	Ah ! You pro's and your jargon :))
2007-03-03T08:26:00.000Z	raven3x7	Narqulie	so if you want to build say mplayer, "apt-get build-dep mplayer" will get all dependencies(all necessary files to compile) for mplayer
2007-03-03T08:29:00.000Z	raven3x7	Narqulie	unfortunaly no. but there between universe and multiverse there are not that many programs not in a ubuntu repo
2007-03-03T08:30:00.000Z	Narqulie	raven3x7	Can this repo be seen somewhere, like, a list of programs that are in it?
2007-03-03T08:32:00.000Z	raven3x7	Narqulie	sure. go to System->Administration-> Software Sources and enable community maintened... and prpriarety drivers for ...
2007-03-03T08:33:00.000Z	raven3x7	Narqulie	sure. go to System->Administration-> and open Synaptic
2007-03-03T08:33:00.000Z	Narqulie	raven3x7	Roger
2007-03-03T08:36:00.000Z	raven3x7	Narqulie	if synaptic confuses you Applications -> Add/remove is much simpler
