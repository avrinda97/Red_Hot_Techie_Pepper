2009-09-12T00:27:00.000Z	Yorub		When will the next LTS be released?
2009-09-12T00:28:00.000Z	Yorub		Does anybody know the name of the next LTS?
2009-09-12T00:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yorub	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames
2009-09-12T00:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yorub	its still up in the air, karmic isnt even released yet :D
2009-09-12T00:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yorub	yes, a proper format and then put the data back on will gain the extra functionality that convert filesystems do not get
2009-09-12T00:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yorub	if you upgrade ext3 to ext4 you dont get the full advantages of ext4
2009-09-12T00:52:00.000Z	Yorub	ActionParsnip	Are you sure about that?
2009-09-12T00:52:00.000Z	Yorub	ActionParsnip	Aren't there any good converters?
2009-09-12T00:54:00.000Z	Yorub	ActionParsnip	Did you mean any difference between "proper format" and "format"?
2009-09-12T00:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yorub	a converted file system to ext4 is inferior to wiping all data off and formatting to ext4 properly
2009-09-12T00:56:00.000Z	Yorub	ActionParsnip	I got that
2009-09-12T01:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yorub	newer hardware may benefit from the newer kernel
2009-09-12T01:15:00.000Z	Yorub	ActionParsnip	What kernel will Karmic use?
2009-09-12T01:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yorub	2.6.31
2009-09-12T01:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yorub	maybe, maybe you have implemented extra boot options and system settings to speed up bootup
2009-09-12T01:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yorub	dont forget, bootup isnt a gauge of speed. id rather have a slower boot for faster actual desktop performance
2009-09-12T01:17:00.000Z	Yorub	ActionParsnip	Not that there is some trade-off between the two.
2009-09-12T01:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yorub	true, but dont get tied up with boot time, its very trivial
2009-09-12T01:20:00.000Z	Yorub	ActionParsnip	I know, but Hardy boots up *real* slow.
2009-09-12T01:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yorub	its offtopic here
2009-09-12T01:20:00.000Z	Yorub	ActionParsnip	As long as Hardy is still supported, it should be on-topic.
2009-09-12T01:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yorub	its not a support question, its random chatter #ubuntu is for support only, #ubuntu-offtopic is for ubuntu-related chatter
