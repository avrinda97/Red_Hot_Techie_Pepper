2008-06-18T08:46:00.000Z	anachronist		so, nobody has an answer to my usb 2.0 question? that makes me sad.
2008-06-18T08:46:00.000Z	lockd	anachronist	what's wrong with usb 2.0?
2008-06-18T08:47:00.000Z	lockd	anachronist	I've had little quirky things like USB mouse not even being detected, I was only able to fix it with an adapter
2008-06-18T08:47:00.000Z	anachronist	lockd	i'm having some trouble w/ my external hard drive. i can't get it to run in usb 2.0. i had to modprobe -r ehci_hcd to force it to run at 1.1. i found a kernel option that i'm going to try after i finish copying some files
2008-06-18T08:48:00.000Z	anachronist		but i'm curious to know first, what the issue is, and second, what the acpi=noirq kernel option does
2008-06-18T08:49:00.000Z	lockd	anachronist	it says usb 2.0 is in kernel >= 2.5.2, amazing that it wouldn't work
2008-06-18T08:49:00.000Z	anachronist		well, i've found a LARGE number of people having similar problems, unfortunately
2008-06-18T08:50:00.000Z	anachronist	lockd	most people who have this problem (drive not mounting, etc.) just remove the module, which is horrible solution imho
2008-06-18T08:50:00.000Z	lockd	anachronist	I wouldn't be surprised if it never did work (2.5 was unstable, may never have made it in)
2008-06-18T08:52:00.000Z	lockd	anachronist	you have ohci and uhci included as well?
2008-06-18T08:52:00.000Z	anachronist	lockd	no uchi, but ochi is in lsmod
2008-06-18T08:53:00.000Z	anachronist		err... uhci
2008-06-18T08:53:00.000Z	lockd	anachronist	not sure, wonder what would happen if you said Y instead of M for EHCI HCD
2008-06-18T08:54:00.000Z	lockd	anachronist	heh, that's not even an option
2008-06-18T08:54:00.000Z	anachronist	lockd	well, i'm running off the generic kernel... maybe i should try to recompile my own and see if that helps. that's a good idea.
2008-06-18T08:56:00.000Z	lockd	anachronist	the only other instance of this that I'm seeing is trying to mount a usb 2.0 drive on a usb 1.1 board
2008-06-18T08:56:00.000Z	anachronist	lockd	i hope it's not hardware. i'll double check my mobo specs, but i'm pretty sure it supports 2.0
2008-06-18T08:57:00.000Z	lockd	anachronist	http://www.fedoraforum.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-40197.html, there's a workaround that I'm not sure will do anything (changing /sys stuffs)
2008-06-18T08:57:00.000Z	anachronist	lockd	that's the workaround i'm using now
2008-06-18T08:59:00.000Z	lockd	anachronist	didn't know that one disabled usb2 as well
2008-06-18T08:59:00.000Z	anachronist	lockd	oh, wait. i see the other workaround. i'll try the sys one.
2008-06-18T08:59:00.000Z	anachronist	lockd	thanks for the help.
