2010-07-13T08:36:00.000Z	usacomputertec		Hey i'm installing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 on Wine using PlayOnLinux and I need to force Gmount to unmount cdrom1 for me and then mount the second disk in it's place
2010-07-13T08:36:00.000Z	usacomputertec		people on the internet say to put in wine eject but that does not work
2010-07-13T08:36:00.000Z	usacomputertec		can anyone help me?
2010-07-13T08:37:00.000Z	usacomputertec		I need to force an unmount of a looped drive
2010-07-13T08:37:00.000Z	usacomputertec		mounted using gmount
2010-07-13T08:38:00.000Z	usacomputertec		how can I force gmount to unmount
2010-07-13T08:39:00.000Z	usacomputertec		sudo unmount --force what?
2010-07-13T08:41:00.000Z	Out_Cold	usacomputertec	sudo mkdir /mnt/disk
2010-07-13T08:41:00.000Z	usacomputertec	Out_Cold	ok I just tried and it says it's bussy
2010-07-13T08:43:00.000Z	Out_Cold	usacomputertec	is there a nautilus open to /media/cdrom?
2010-07-13T08:43:00.000Z	usacomputertec	Out_Cold	I've done this before
2010-07-13T08:44:00.000Z	usacomputertec	Out_Cold	it's the installer that's keeping it locked
2010-07-13T08:44:00.000Z	Out_Cold	usacomputertec	then pkill or kill the installer
2010-07-13T08:44:00.000Z	usacomputertec	Out_Cold	NO!!!
2010-07-13T08:44:00.000Z	usacomputertec	Out_Cold	the installer has to stay open
2010-07-13T08:44:00.000Z	usacomputertec	Out_Cold	so I can mount the second disk
2010-07-13T08:45:00.000Z	usacomputertec	Out_Cold	now someone understands
2010-07-13T08:45:00.000Z	usacomputertec	Out_Cold	so how do you force a disk to unmount while it's bussy
2010-07-13T08:46:00.000Z	Out_Cold	usacomputertec	stick a pin in the tiny hole on the front of the disk drive lol
2010-07-13T08:46:00.000Z	usacomputertec	Out_Cold	it's mounted using gmount iso
2010-07-13T08:47:00.000Z	usacomputertec	Out_Cold	I'm using an iso
2010-07-13T08:48:00.000Z	Out_Cold	usacomputertec	no.. i kinda jumped into the problem halfway... but even as an iso... if the installer won't let go of the device, good luck..
