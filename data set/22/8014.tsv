2005-12-13T08:19:00.000Z	dawnF		can someone help me? Ubuntu doesn't boot anymore and seems to hang when mounting local filesystems
2005-12-13T08:19:00.000Z	dawnF		i'm not quite sure what i should do next
2005-12-13T08:20:00.000Z	soundray	dawnF	did you change anything in the bios setup?
2005-12-13T08:20:00.000Z	soundray	dawnF	have you tried booting the rescue kernel?
2005-12-13T08:21:00.000Z	soundray	dawnF	with the rescue kernel, are you able to mount /dev/sdb3 from the command line?
2005-12-13T08:22:00.000Z	dawnF	soundray	strange thing i did a ctr alt F4 and i'm able to boot
2005-12-13T08:23:00.000Z	soundray	dawnF	no idea. Perhaps your /var/log/syslog has some error message relating to the problem.
2005-12-13T08:34:00.000Z	soundray	dawnF	I don't know, but if you paste your fstab on pastebin.ubuntulinux.nl, I'll try and help you debug it.
2005-12-13T08:36:00.000Z	dawnF	soundray	> i pasted it as fstab dawnnf
2005-12-13T08:38:00.000Z	soundray	dawnF	do you have a /dev/sda at all?
2005-12-13T08:39:00.000Z	dawnF	soundray	> is there a way of telling?
2005-12-13T08:39:00.000Z	soundray	dawnF	how many hard drives in your machine?
2005-12-13T08:40:00.000Z	soundray	dawnF	and your first hd is for another OS I take it?
2005-12-13T08:41:00.000Z	soundray	dawnF	are your drives on a SATA, SCSI, USB or firewire bus?
2005-12-13T08:43:00.000Z	dawnF	soundray	do you think the problem is the fstab file or perhaps the drive itself?
2005-12-13T08:43:00.000Z	soundray	dawnF	apart from the fact that you are booting Ubuntu from your second hd, I can see nothing special or faulty in your fstab.
2005-12-13T08:43:00.000Z	soundray	dawnF	if booting works all right at the moment, I wouldn't worry about it for now.
2005-12-13T08:44:00.000Z	dawnF	soundray	i haven't tried rebooting it
2005-12-13T08:45:00.000Z	soundray	dawnF	perhaps it's hanging on something different altogether. Is your boot screen graphical (big Ubuntu logo)?
2005-12-13T08:45:00.000Z	soundray	dawnF	do you know how to change that? It might reveal what the real problem is.
2005-12-13T08:46:00.000Z	soundray	dawnF	so you're all set?
2005-12-13T08:49:00.000Z	soundray	dawnF	cheers.
