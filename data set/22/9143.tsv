2005-02-25T08:15:00.000Z	krism	ompaul	: set up an ssh-vpn
2005-02-25T08:16:00.000Z	krism	ompaul	: (which is how im on IRC "from" my employers)
2005-02-25T08:16:00.000Z	krism	ompaul	: despite being on a ridiculously restrictive firewall
2005-02-25T08:17:00.000Z	ompaul	krism	I have used Open VPN on several occasions - you prove the point lock the door and staff will walk around it - security involves everybody
2005-02-25T08:18:00.000Z	krism	ompaul	: ah, .. ppp over ssh (over https) was just easier for me than a 'real' vpn
2005-02-25T08:18:00.000Z	ompaul	krism	it is in most cases
2005-02-25T08:19:00.000Z	ompaul	krism	it is funny one contract I had recently involved proving that open vpn worked cos SSH was a browser technology I was told by a systems integrator - enough already I will only get mad
2005-02-25T08:20:00.000Z	krism	ompaul	: haha
2005-02-25T08:24:00.000Z	ompaul	krism	so we go visit the "hq" of these people - we had discovered that they had broken routing in the building - every machine had as its default route itself - and so when we did a ping sweep from the yellow in the dmz we saw only one win 98 box but from the green card we saw the whole network - anyway we go to this office set up from a very old laptop (just to make a point) fight with them to open icmp on 5k ssh in to the far end en
2005-02-25T08:31:00.000Z	krism	ompaul	: ack, sheesh. sorry it took me so long to respond.
2005-02-25T08:31:00.000Z	krism	ompaul	: (that was about the place that had every boxes default route set to itself)
2005-02-25T08:34:00.000Z	ompaul	krism	yes we had a shouting match with the integrator in their (the integrators) office -  (consider this with all caps) Just add the bloody route will you the default route ohh FFS look type this command etc it took them 3 hours to open the firewall correctly and one hour to add the default route
2005-02-25T08:34:00.000Z	ompaul	krism	anyway thats enough of that :)
2005-02-25T08:35:00.000Z	ompaul	krism	 raw_input()
