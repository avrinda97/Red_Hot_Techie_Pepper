2010-08-20T22:31:00.000Z	jimcooncat		in the cli, how do I delete all files in a directory dated before 2010-08-01?
2010-08-20T22:33:00.000Z	maco	jimcooncat	access time or modified time?
2010-08-20T22:33:00.000Z	jimcooncat	maco	I'd guess modified time. Actually created time
2010-08-20T22:34:00.000Z	maco	jimcooncat	hmm find doesnt have an option for creation time
2010-08-20T22:34:00.000Z	jimcooncat	maco	I'd guess modified time, then. I can see it with ls -al
2010-08-20T22:36:00.000Z	maco	jimcooncat	find . -mtime +19 -exec rm {} +
2010-08-20T22:36:00.000Z	maco	jimcooncat	 i think
2010-08-20T22:36:00.000Z	maco	jimcooncat	thatd delete all files in the current directory and downward modified most recently more than 20 days ago
2010-08-20T22:37:00.000Z	jimcooncat	maco	that just might save my apt-cacher. thank you too hiku
2010-08-28T02:39:00.000Z	maco	jimcooncat	yep, and then your tabs get restored! yay!
2010-08-28T02:40:00.000Z	jimcooncat	maco	is there a way I can load just one of the url I want at startup?
2010-08-28T02:41:00.000Z	maco	jimcooncat	if you run:  firefox http://yahoo.com            <--- for example, thatd just open yahoo.com
2010-08-28T02:41:00.000Z	jimcooncat	maco	I have firefox with an url loaded as a startup application. When I close firefox then reboot, fine. But when I just reboot without closing, it opens two tabs of the url
2010-08-28T02:42:00.000Z	maco	jimcooncat	oh....umm lemme check firefox's command line options
2010-08-28T02:44:00.000Z	maco	jimcooncat	dont know. i dont see a command line flag for that
2010-08-28T02:45:00.000Z	jimcooncat	maco	me neither. maybe I have to play with profiles, or find a way to actually close firefox nicely on logout
2010-08-28T02:46:00.000Z	maco	jimcooncat	maybe something in about:config to turn off tab restore?
2010-08-28T02:48:00.000Z	maco	jimcooncat	edit -> preferences -> when firefox starts:   is it set to "show my home page" or "show my windows and tabs from last time"?
2010-08-28T02:48:00.000Z	maco	jimcooncat	oh thats something you could do too
2010-08-28T02:48:00.000Z	jimcooncat	maco	just home page
2010-08-28T02:48:00.000Z	maco	jimcooncat	just set that url as your homepage and then dont set it to automatically open a url
2010-08-28T02:49:00.000Z	jimcooncat	maco	I'll try that
