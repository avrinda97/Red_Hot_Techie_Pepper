2010-11-24T12:34:00.000Z	krunal		whats the major differences btwn ubuntu and kubuntu
2010-11-24T12:35:00.000Z	krunal		right I read that.. but i've never used KDE....ubuntu is my first distro i've ever used
2010-11-24T12:35:00.000Z	krunal		is KDE better? worse? any different?
2010-11-24T12:35:00.000Z	coz_	krunal	  well kde can be more resource intensive than gnome
2010-11-24T12:36:00.000Z	coz_	krunal	  this is your first linux attempt?
2010-11-24T12:36:00.000Z	krunal	coz_	yes
2010-11-24T12:37:00.000Z	coz_	krunal	oh well... probably like everyone here...you will experiment with different Desktop Environments  and applications
2010-11-24T12:37:00.000Z	coz_	krunal	  honestly ...I would suggest...at some point in this journey , that you do just that,, try the different Evironments available...some with suit your needs  others will  make you angry :)
2010-11-24T12:38:00.000Z	krunal	coz_	yes you are right.. i'll try KDE on the new system...i really like Ubuntu 10.10 right now. It's really friendly and pretty powerful
2010-11-24T12:38:00.000Z	coz_	krunal	  oh yeah...and I always come back to the Gnome desktop environment
2010-11-24T12:39:00.000Z	coz_	krunal	  I find it ,,, from my perspective,,, more logical and easier to get around in... kde is "fancier"  than gnome :)
2010-11-24T12:42:00.000Z	krunal	coz_	on a new dell xps notebook...fancy might be good :)
2010-11-24T12:43:00.000Z	coz_	krunal	  absolutely :)   test it out.... experiment ...that 's part of the learning process
2011-01-03T06:56:00.000Z	coz_	krunal	  disable the nvidia in the bios and use the intel
2011-01-03T06:57:00.000Z	krunal	coz_	there is no option to disable the nvidia.... i know i shouldn't have got this video card but no choice now
2011-01-03T06:57:00.000Z	coz_	krunal	 oooo   open terminal  paste this command     lspci | grep -i vga

2011-01-03T06:59:00.000Z	coz_	krunal	  are you sure there is no way in the bio to disable that nvidia ??
2011-01-03T07:00:00.000Z	krunal	coz_	yea i'm sure
2011-01-03T07:00:00.000Z	coz_	krunal	 I assume  this is a laptop?
2011-01-03T07:00:00.000Z	krunal	coz_	yes.. laptop. I want to use the nvidia only
2011-01-03T07:02:00.000Z	coz_	krunal	  you will have to blacklist the nvidia I believe
