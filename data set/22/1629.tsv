2010-04-27T09:16:00.000Z	itilious		how do i keep a script running in the background?
2010-04-27T09:16:00.000Z	sinistrad	itilious	follow the command with &
2010-04-27T09:16:00.000Z	sinistrad	itilious	that is if you haven't started it
2010-04-27T09:17:00.000Z	sinistrad	itilious	if it is already started, then you can CTRL Z, which I think will halt it, give you back command-line, and then put in bg %1 to background it
2010-04-27T09:19:00.000Z	itilious	sinistrad	i'm trying to keep this script running in the background http://script.jmap82.com/doku.php?id=jmap82sscripts:monitor
2010-04-27T09:21:00.000Z	sinistrad	itilious	when you run that script, follow it with &
2010-04-27T09:21:00.000Z	sinistrad	itilious	it will background it, and give you back the command line
2010-04-27T09:21:00.000Z	itilious	sinistrad	sorry for my noob question but how exactly do i run it :/
2010-04-27T09:22:00.000Z	sinistrad	itilious	you navigate to the script, and do ./script &
2010-04-27T09:28:00.000Z	itilious	sinistrad	the terminal simply gave me a reply of :9894
2010-04-27T09:28:00.000Z	sinistrad	itilious	that is the pid of the process
2010-04-27T09:29:00.000Z	itilious	sinistrad	is it necessary to use sudo with it everytime?
2010-04-27T09:30:00.000Z	sinistrad	itilious	 some processes require sudo to get escalated priviliges. I guess that one might.  You can try without.  It will complain or not work otherwise
2010-04-27T09:31:00.000Z	itilious	sinistrad	so then even if i make it a launcher i will still need to enter the password manually everytime?
2010-04-27T09:32:00.000Z	sinistrad	itilious	well, that would be proper that if it requires it.
2010-04-27T09:38:00.000Z	sinistrad	itilious	of course.  I try. Not often I can offer help, but I try
2010-04-27T09:47:00.000Z	itilious	sinistrad	i still dont see the script under the process list though :(
2010-04-27T09:48:00.000Z	sinistrad	itilious	you might be able to sort by pid, and then check for the script name, and it might also be listed as a path/script
2010-04-27T09:50:00.000Z	itilious	sinistrad	no script name or PID
2010-04-27T09:50:00.000Z	sinistrad	itilious	it may have exited
2010-04-27T09:52:00.000Z	sinistrad	itilious	check the terminal window you ran it from, often when a program exits normally, you'll just see "done"(I think) printed out, and may list the pid with it
2010-04-27T09:53:00.000Z	sinistrad	itilious	also, if it segfaulted or otherwise had a problem, you might see something there too
