2009-07-09T01:09:00.000Z	Beatlesfan		wow...almost did it... almost switched back to Windows... - what was I thinking!!
2009-07-09T01:10:00.000Z	Beatlesfan		time lapse to install Windows XP sp3 from sp1 CD with all apps - ~5 hours
2009-07-09T01:10:00.000Z	Beatlesfan		time lapse to install Ubuntu Jaunty with all apps - < 1 hour
2009-07-09T01:10:00.000Z	Beatlesfan		right
2009-07-09T01:11:00.000Z	aspidites	Beatlesfan	time lapse to install archlinux with all apps you want - < 30 min :) j/k not here to advertise, just wanna help
2009-07-09T01:11:00.000Z	aspidites	Beatlesfan	assuming you go with minimal desktop of course
2009-07-09T01:12:00.000Z	Beatlesfan	aspidites	I went with enhanced desktop and took a little less than an hour to install
2009-07-09T01:13:00.000Z	aspidites	Beatlesfan	enhanced desktop. for ubuntu i assume that means gnome + compiz
2009-07-09T01:14:00.000Z	Beatlesfan	aspidites	right, exactly plus I had to roll back my intel driver so that it could handle it..
2009-07-09T01:14:00.000Z	aspidites	Beatlesfan	ah. is ubuntu not using fusion plugins yet?
2009-07-09T01:14:00.000Z	Beatlesfan	aspidites	not sure
2009-07-09T01:14:00.000Z	Beatlesfan	aspidites	can't get it to work with my Geforce 6200 Nvidia card
2009-07-09T01:15:00.000Z	aspidites	Beatlesfan	which nvidia drivers btw? 185.18.14 is running nice with my 8600
2009-07-09T01:15:00.000Z	Beatlesfan	aspidites	again, not sure
2009-07-09T01:16:00.000Z	Beatlesfan	aspidites	I need to do some more research, but Its' working great on my onboard intel 865G video driver
2009-07-09T01:16:00.000Z	aspidites	Beatlesfan	really? i've heard all kinds of horror stories about intel drivers. particularly framebuffer graphics issues and artifacts while gaming
2009-07-09T01:17:00.000Z	Beatlesfan	aspidites	it took me some heavy research but I found a solution that works.. you have to rollback the driver to a previous version
2009-07-09T01:17:00.000Z	Beatlesfan	aspidites	I thought for sure my Geforce 6200 would work but no joy
2009-07-09T01:17:00.000Z	Beatlesfan	aspidites	Ubuntu won't even boot
2009-07-09T01:18:00.000Z	aspidites	Beatlesfan	really? worst i ever got was a crashing x session. i could always get to run level 3 though
2009-07-09T01:19:00.000Z	aspidites	Beatlesfan	then again, doesn't ubuntu start init 5 and gdm by default anyways?
2009-07-09T01:19:00.000Z	Beatlesfan	aspidites	Ubuntu starts to boot up , gets about 1/4 way through start up and hangs... screen turns black.. nothing
