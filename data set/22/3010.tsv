2009-04-20T03:00:00.000Z	tgr_		hi is there an internet browser that is less cpu heavy than firefox?
2009-04-20T03:02:00.000Z	tgr_		anyone use xfce on ubuntu? is it really lighter like they say? last time i used it i had a lot of package conflicts i didn't know how to fix
2009-04-20T03:03:00.000Z	tgr_		lately my laptop has been overheating due to azurues and virtualbox running and it never happened before so i am wondering what is going on
2009-04-20T03:03:00.000Z	Dante123	tgr_	it is lighter, but I wonder how much more....anyway there is also LXDE you can try...which is truly lighter
2009-04-20T03:04:00.000Z	Dante123	tgr_	how do you know that it is due to those two applications?
2009-04-20T03:07:00.000Z	Dante123	tgr_	lappy just shuts down all on its own?
2009-04-20T03:11:00.000Z	Dante123	tgr_	what model/make of computer and approximate age?
2009-04-20T03:12:00.000Z	tgr_	Dante123	hp laptop dv6768se 1 year
2009-04-20T03:12:00.000Z	Dante123	tgr_	is this a ubuntu only pc.....or do you have windows dual boot?
2009-04-20T03:13:00.000Z	tgr_	Dante123	ubuntu only
2009-04-20T03:13:00.000Z	tgr_	Dante123	when i run virtualbox and azureus it gets screwed up i installed madwifi customized driver before when the net signal went out it would overheat and shutdown also
2009-04-20T03:14:00.000Z	Dante123	tgr_	okay.  I was wondering if the problem occured on windows side at all....but you only have ubuntu.  What about if you boot from livecd....do you still get the same thing happening?  Also, you could try the virtualbox channel for help...maybe they know if there is an issue....also are u running latest version of vbox and azareus??
2009-04-20T03:14:00.000Z	tgr_	Dante123	it would happen also when i was running Transmission but i think it is a network card driver issue with wifi when i use ethernet cable it doesn't happen like before like i said now it just gets really hot and shuts off
2009-04-20T03:15:00.000Z	tgr_	Dante123	yes i am
2009-04-20T03:15:00.000Z	tgr_	Dante123	could it be any problem with the fact i have an amd64 processor and am runnnig i386 ubuntu and packages?
2009-04-20T03:15:00.000Z	tgr_	Dante123	that is what was advised to me before
2009-04-20T03:15:00.000Z	tgr_	Dante123	to run i386 due to compatability issues
2009-04-20T03:16:00.000Z	Dante123	tgr_	hmm...that is a good question.  Again, I would try the vbox channel.  Guy names erstazi is particularly knowledgable and helpful if he is on
2009-04-20T03:18:00.000Z	Dante123	tgr_	I think you may be onto something....with fact with the 32 bit packages under 64 bit
2009-04-20T03:19:00.000Z	tgr_	Dante123	do you think that was good advice?
2009-04-20T03:20:00.000Z	tgr_	Dante123	when i was using amd 64 before the packages were not being compatible
2009-04-20T03:20:00.000Z	Dante123	tgr_	I have not bit the 64bit bullet yet.  And I am wary of it ...but others say all is good.  Who knows?
