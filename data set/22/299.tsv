2012-11-10T03:58:00.000Z	Sam86		Hi, I have a query if anyones able to answer
2012-11-10T03:59:00.000Z	Sam86		why thanks mr bot.
2012-11-10T03:59:00.000Z	Sam86		I was trying to move a bunch of folders to /apple/cake from apple/cake/pie/x/x/x/x/x/x/x
2012-11-10T03:59:00.000Z	Sam86		however i meant to move them to /apple/cake/pie
2012-11-10T03:59:00.000Z	Sam86		So now there all in /apple/cake/ So basically I want to move ALL files/folders from apple/cake/ to apple/cake/pie/
2012-11-10T04:00:00.000Z	Sam86		without including the folder pie
2012-11-10T04:00:00.000Z	Sam86		in the command
2012-11-10T04:00:00.000Z	Seveas	Sam86	easy, cd /apple/cake; mv * pie
2012-11-10T04:01:00.000Z	Seveas		mv will complain it can't move pie to itself but happily do the others
2012-11-10T04:01:00.000Z	Sam86	Seveas	complains some directories are not empty,
2012-11-10T04:02:00.000Z	Seveas	Sam86	err, that means it moved some files in those directories but couldn't move others due to permission issues
2012-11-10T04:02:00.000Z	Sam86		http://i.imgur.com/8XRSr.png Directory not empty means permissions?
2012-11-10T04:02:00.000Z	Sam86		Odd, wouldn't it say permissions for that.
2012-11-10T04:03:00.000Z	Seveas		you're going to need to give me some more details, like the output of ls /apple/cake and ls /apple/cake/pie
2012-11-10T04:03:00.000Z	Seveas		ls -la that is
2012-11-10T04:03:00.000Z	Sam86		K, but none of the folders with contents moved.
2012-11-10T04:03:00.000Z	Sam86		However i guess there are only 5 folders I could just manual cp the rest. but I'd rather know a way for future use
2012-11-10T04:04:00.000Z	Sam86		I sent the ls -la via pm Seveas
2012-11-10T04:04:00.000Z	Seveas	Sam86	no pm received
2012-11-10T04:04:00.000Z	Sam86		Ugh stupid web client, I've no irc properly on this pc
2012-11-10T04:04:00.000Z	Sam86		1 sec
2012-11-10T04:04:00.000Z	Seveas	Sam86	mail to seveas@seveas.net works too :)
