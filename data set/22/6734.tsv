2011-11-29T02:11:00.000Z	mikeg		so in 11.10 with unity, how do I make alt-tab or an equivalent respect workspaces like it used to. I want to have more than one "set" of applications open at a time?
2011-11-29T02:12:00.000Z	usr13	mikeg	What do you mean?  (Alt-Tab switches windows not work-spaces)
2011-11-29T02:12:00.000Z	mikeg	usr13	it used to switch between windows in a workspace, now it switches between windows in all workspaces.
2011-11-29T02:13:00.000Z	usr13	mikeg	Far as I know, it always did that.
2011-11-29T02:13:00.000Z	mikeg	usr13	I like my workspaces segregated because I'll have say eclipse and ff open in 3 different workspaces but one is for web dev, one for c++, and one for reading the nets
2011-11-29T02:13:00.000Z	mikeg	usr13	nope.
2011-11-29T02:14:00.000Z	mikeg	usr13	I've got 11.04 running classic desktop on my desktop and it behaves as I said, my laptop has 11.10 and it has the current behavior (which sucks for me)
2011-11-29T02:15:00.000Z	usr13	mikeg	I see that you are correct.  In gnome2 Alt-Tab would only switch between windows in one workspace.
2011-11-29T02:15:00.000Z	usr13	mikeg	I guess that's not the way it works in Unity.
2011-11-29T02:16:00.000Z	mikeg	usr13	so is there a good way to re-enable that. I like the search overlay of unity like win 7, but I don't want to shut down all non-task related firefoxes
2011-11-29T02:18:00.000Z	usr13	mikeg	I'm not sure.  Maybe someone else knows how it can be done.
2011-11-29T02:19:00.000Z	mikeg	usr13	guess I'll ask again then
2011-11-29T02:21:00.000Z	usr13	mikeg	Here is a discussion about the use of Alt-Tab in Unity: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1720998
2011-11-29T02:24:00.000Z	mikeg	usr13	yeah, I tried that. didn't work that well. I'll try again but it still seems pretty broken. Why are workspaces even there if this is how it's going to work?
2011-11-29T02:25:00.000Z	usr13	mikeg	Was just checking and xfce confines Alt-Tab to windows in current workspace too.
2011-11-29T02:27:00.000Z	mikeg	usr13	urg, that's great and all but I actually like a lot of what unity does like the search to launch. it saves a lot of space. Why can't it just allow easy return to the previous behavior?
2011-11-29T02:28:00.000Z	usr13	mikeg	What is "search to launch"?
2011-11-29T02:28:00.000Z	mikeg	usr13	super key, type fire, enter
2011-11-29T02:29:00.000Z	usr13	mikeg	I think that is just a hot-key assignment. Right?
2011-11-29T02:29:00.000Z	usr13	mikeg	.... same as Alt-F2  ?
2011-11-29T02:29:00.000Z	mikeg	usr13	not sure. reading
2011-11-29T02:30:00.000Z	mikeg	usr13	yeah alt-f2 is search to me :)
