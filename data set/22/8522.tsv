2005-07-18T07:37:00.000Z	tanki		oga, you'll go nuts if you try to keep track of them all :)
2005-07-18T07:37:00.000Z	tanki		oga, what you should do is just install everything and remove what you dont like afterwards
2005-07-18T07:37:00.000Z	tanki		oga, yeah i know what you mean, sometimes i stroll /bin and /usr/bin and i get a tear in my eye.. so many memories
2005-07-18T07:39:00.000Z	tanki		oga, it's better to break something right after a fresh install than it is 6 months later when you have everything customized
2005-07-18T07:40:00.000Z	tanki		the first time i ran linux, at around 4am the hard drive started to cycle i thought i was being hacked into so i re-installed
2005-07-18T07:40:00.000Z	tanki		oh now you tell me, where were you 6 years ago!
2005-07-18T07:40:00.000Z	tanki		when i needed this little bit of info
2005-07-18T07:41:00.000Z	tanki		:)
2005-07-18T07:41:00.000Z	tanki		does ubuntu use grub as the bootloader or lilo?
2005-07-18T07:42:00.000Z	Seveas	tanki	grub by default
2005-07-18T07:42:00.000Z	tanki	Seveas	yeah it seems grub is the default for everyone these days.. is lilo still included?
2005-07-18T07:43:00.000Z	Seveas	tanki	yes
2005-07-18T07:44:00.000Z	tanki	Seveas	i still fancy lilo but i'm an old dog hehe
2005-07-18T07:45:00.000Z	tanki	Seveas	i remember once a hacker friend of mine had his video card die overnight and he had to retrieve a phone number from a contact list on his computer (the computer wasn't networked) and he used lilo and blindy beeped out the phone number with just shell script heh
2005-07-18T07:46:00.000Z	Seveas	tanki	lol :)

2005-07-27T16:50:00.000Z	Seveas	tanki	/etc/hosts is used a lot...
2005-07-27T16:50:00.000Z	Seveas	tanki	for sudoers for instance
2005-07-27T16:50:00.000Z	Seveas	tanki	or nis
