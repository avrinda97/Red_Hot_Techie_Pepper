2005-10-16T06:52:00.000Z	duncanm		hmm... 3 days
2005-10-16T06:52:00.000Z	Hobbsee	duncanm	you're thinking of installing breezy early?
2005-10-16T06:53:00.000Z	duncanm	Hobbsee	maybe, yeah
2005-10-16T06:53:00.000Z	Hobbsee	duncanm	seems stable enough, plenty of people are using it
2005-10-16T06:54:00.000Z	duncanm	Hobbsee	the upgrade path is smooth?
2005-10-16T06:54:00.000Z	Hobbsee	duncanm	can be, sometimes it isnt.  it's safer to install from a daily cd, just make sure you have a backup
2005-10-16T06:54:00.000Z	duncanm	Hobbsee	i figured, not much is gonna change between today and 3 days from now
2005-10-16T06:55:00.000Z	Hobbsee	duncanm	seems like still a bit, but it shouldnt make much difference unless you are on dialup
2005-10-16T06:56:00.000Z	duncanm	Hobbsee	yeah, and that way i get a headstart
2005-10-16T06:56:00.000Z	Hobbsee	duncanm	that you do
2005-10-16T06:57:00.000Z	duncanm	Hobbsee	are you running it already?
2005-10-16T06:57:00.000Z	Hobbsee	duncanm	yeah, kubuntu though, plety of people are running both kubuntu or ubuntu
2005-10-16T07:06:00.000Z	duncanm	Hobbsee	it says i could 'lost data', i don't see why that would happen...
2005-10-16T07:06:00.000Z	duncanm	Hobbsee	i just have one big partition, and i don't have space for backup
2005-10-16T07:09:00.000Z	Hobbsee	duncanm	are you on windows now?
2005-10-16T07:09:00.000Z	duncanm	Hobbsee	nope
2005-10-16T07:12:00.000Z	duncanm	Hobbsee	do you know?
2005-10-16T07:14:00.000Z	Hobbsee	duncanm	sudo apt-key add nameofkey.gpg
2005-10-16T07:15:00.000Z	duncanm	Hobbsee	is there a new key?
2005-10-16T07:17:00.000Z	Hobbsee	duncanm	possibly, i dont know
2005-10-16T08:23:00.000Z	duncanm	Hobbsee	it's gonna be done in 8 mins
2005-10-16T08:24:00.000Z	Hobbsee	duncanm	cool :)
