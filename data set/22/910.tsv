2011-03-09T04:10:00.000Z	amh345		if i can ssh into a server, should i also be able to scp into it?
2011-03-09T04:12:00.000Z	BernardV	amh345	Yes, if you can ssh you can scp
2011-03-09T04:12:00.000Z	amh345	BernardV	i keep getting permission denied.   scp ~/my_file user@host
2011-03-09T04:13:00.000Z	BernardV	amh345	scp ~/my_file user@host:~/
2011-03-09T04:13:00.000Z	BernardV		after host: you specify the target folder on the server
2011-03-09T04:14:00.000Z	amh345	BernardV	that returns scp: /~: Permission denied
2011-03-09T04:14:00.000Z	BernardV	amh345	If you login with ssh and try 'touch my_file' does it work or give you a permission denied?
2011-03-09T04:15:00.000Z	amh345	BernardV	the file doesnt exist on the server yet.
2011-03-09T04:15:00.000Z	BernardV	amh345	I know, but do you have write permissions on the server?
2011-03-09T04:15:00.000Z	amh345	BernardV	Touch my_file returns a new line
2011-03-09T04:16:00.000Z	BernardV	amh345	And if correct there is a file created with the name my_file
2011-03-09T04:16:00.000Z	amh345	BernardV	oh, neat.  yes. my_File was createrd
2011-03-09T04:17:00.000Z	BernardV	amh345	ok, then you have write permissions :) You can delete this file
2011-03-09T04:17:00.000Z	amh345	BernardV	but i still cant scp :(
2011-03-09T04:17:00.000Z	BernardV	amh345	And are you sure you have read permissions on the local file and have the rights to execute scp ?
2011-03-09T04:19:00.000Z	amh345	BernardV	i have permissions. tried sudo as well.   still getting Permission Deneid.
2011-03-09T04:20:00.000Z	BernardV	amh345	scp my_file user@host:/tmp/ ?
2011-03-09T04:20:00.000Z	amh345	BernardV	ill try :/tmp/
2011-03-09T04:21:00.000Z	amh345	BernardV	:/tmp/ worked!
2011-03-09T04:21:00.000Z	amh345		thank you
2011-03-09T04:21:00.000Z	BernardV	amh345	Then there is a permission issue on the server or you don't have a home folder you can use like ~/
2011-03-09T04:22:00.000Z	amh345	BernardV	ill have a look into that.
