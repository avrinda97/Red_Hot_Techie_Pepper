2007-04-22T08:53:00.000Z	refefer		hey guys, anyone out here know how to change ubuntu to accept widescreen resolutions on an Olevia LCD tv?  I'd really appreciate it.
2007-04-22T08:53:00.000Z	xtknight	refefer	does the LCD tv offer its native res over PC input?
2007-04-22T08:54:00.000Z	xtknight	refefer	is this a secondary monitor or what?
2007-04-22T08:55:00.000Z	refefer	xtknight	no, my primary: I have a winbox running to it via dvi and it works great
2007-04-22T08:55:00.000Z	xtknight	refefer	ah so what are you on now?
2007-04-22T08:56:00.000Z	refefer	xtknight	using a second system hooked up via the vga port (I would use dvi, but this dell only has vga out)
2007-04-22T08:57:00.000Z	refefer	xtknight	I want to thank you in advanced for helping out anyway you can, it sure is nice.
2007-04-22T08:57:00.000Z	xtknight	refefer	ok so you want the linux pc to get dvi to the lcdtv?
2007-04-22T08:57:00.000Z	xtknight	refefer	laptop=linux/vga only and computer=windows/dvi only  or am i confused?
2007-04-22T08:58:00.000Z	refefer	xtknight	no can do since my dell with ubuntu only has vga out.  I'm trying to get ubuntu to use a widescreen resolution on it
2007-04-22T08:58:00.000Z	refefer	xtknight	heh, this is one of those micro cases and for some bizarre reason they cheaped out on dvi
2007-04-22T08:58:00.000Z	xtknight	refefer	ah ok what kind of driver are you using on the dell
2007-04-22T08:59:00.000Z	xtknight	refefer	ok what is the native resoluton of the lcdtv?
2007-04-22T09:00:00.000Z	refefer	xtknight	since it's an HD monitor, it can do up to 1080i.  Personally, I'd be completely fine with 720p which I believe is 1280x720
2007-04-22T09:01:00.000Z	xtknight	refefer	some LCD tvs however do not allow tv input at the native
2007-04-22T09:01:00.000Z	xtknight	refefer	does the lcd tv work at all if you hook it up to the dell (laptop right?)
2007-04-22T09:01:00.000Z	refefer	xtknight	I'm not quite sure I follow what you mean by that.  Are you saying that my tv might not support widescreen via vga?  I know I've been able to get it to work in XP, if that's any help
2007-04-22T09:02:00.000Z	xtknight	refefer	nah that's not really what i'm saying.
2007-04-22T09:02:00.000Z	xtknight	refefer	if it works in XP it  can work in linux
2007-04-22T09:02:00.000Z	xtknight	refefer	does XP use the biggest resolution too?
2007-04-22T09:02:00.000Z	xtknight	refefer	does XP work with the biggest/native resolution of the LCD TV ?  just curious
2007-04-22T09:04:00.000Z	xtknight	refefer	when you hook the LCDTV up to the dell laptop's external VGA what happens?  nothing?
