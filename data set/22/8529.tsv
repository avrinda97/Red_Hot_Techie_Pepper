2005-12-13T16:27:00.000Z	eriksti		anyone able to help me with /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf ?  What's "psk" for example? Been trying to bring my wireless up forever.. "dmesg | grep ipw" shows some good signs at least now
2005-12-13T16:27:00.000Z	eriksti		it's an ipw2200bg
2005-12-13T16:27:00.000Z	Jowi	eriksti	psk is a short for "passkey"
2005-12-13T16:28:00.000Z	eriksti	Jowi	and if I have no idea what it is? :)
2005-12-13T16:28:00.000Z	Jowi	eriksti	do you need a passkey to connect to your router?
2005-12-13T16:29:00.000Z	eriksti	Jowi	 don't think so.. I'm at a univerity, and I think I'd hear about it if so
2005-12-13T16:29:00.000Z	eriksti	Jowi	I leave it blank, remove it or something?
2005-12-13T16:29:00.000Z	Jowi	eriksti	no idea. have no wifi here. have you read the wireless wiki?
2005-12-13T16:30:00.000Z	eriksti	Jowi	I've read lots of stuff.. had this thing over a year without being able to connect lol
2005-12-13T16:32:00.000Z	eriksti	Jowi	I got through this one, that's basically where I'm at right now: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=26623
2005-12-13T16:32:00.000Z	eriksti	Jowi	getting the conf file done right is the last part of that howto
2005-12-13T16:32:00.000Z	Jowi	eriksti	haha, just found the same one
2005-12-13T16:35:00.000Z	eriksti	Jowi	I have Network controller: Intel Corp. PRO/Wireless 2200BG (rev 05)
2005-12-13T16:36:00.000Z	Jowi	eriksti	yes, it is supported it seems. start here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WiFiHowto
2005-12-13T16:36:00.000Z	eriksti	Jowi	 will do
2005-12-13T16:36:00.000Z	eriksti	Jowi	thanks for the help, looks like I have some reading to do! :)
2005-12-13T16:37:00.000Z	Jowi	eriksti	np, let me know if you succeed :)
2005-12-14T17:30:00.000Z	Jowi	eriksti	i thought your card was supported without ndiswrapper...?
2005-12-14T17:30:00.000Z	eriksti	Jowi	gave up
2005-12-14T17:42:00.000Z	eriksti	Jowi	i have up on the normal stuff cause it says "no wireless extensions." all over the plate, with no instructions other than pointing to ndiswrapper
2005-12-14T17:43:00.000Z	Jowi	eriksti	sorry, i'm not the person to ask for help. you emptied my limited knowledge in that area :)
2005-12-14T17:44:00.000Z	eriksti	Jowi	okay.. guess I'll just leave it alone.. wireless in linux sux! :)  not linux' fault though, I guess
