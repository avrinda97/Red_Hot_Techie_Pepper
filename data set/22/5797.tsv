2007-03-21T15:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rhys	open a termina, type lspci
2007-03-21T15:46:00.000Z	rhys	IndyGunFreak	it has a bunch of stuff.
2007-03-21T15:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rhys	thats all the devices on your PCI buss, look for your wireless device
2007-03-21T15:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rhys	well, there's your answer.. :)
2007-03-21T15:49:00.000Z	rhys	IndyGunFreak	thank you.
2007-03-21T15:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rhys	no prob
2007-03-21T15:50:00.000Z	rhys	IndyGunFreak	i dont mean to be a bastard, this was just something to prove the argument that we had at the gaming and computer store im at.
2007-03-21T15:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rhys	what do you mean?
2007-03-21T15:53:00.000Z	rhys	IndyGunFreak	this is the only computer store in a small town. And without external help, ubuntu wont work for 90% of users.
2007-03-21T15:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rhys	oh i see, well, thats hogwash
2007-03-21T15:53:00.000Z	rhys	IndyGunFreak	why?
2007-03-21T15:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rhys	anyone willing to read, just like any learning experience, can learn linux
2007-03-21T15:55:00.000Z	rhys	IndyGunFreak	Exactly. i agree. 90% of people WILL NOT LEARN. the guy who owns the computer store im in right now wrote this, so ill give you a link. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam/NewUserTeam?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=profilinguser-ubuntu-ohio.odp
2007-03-21T15:58:00.000Z	rhys	IndyGunFreak	i have no trouble with the wireless guide you sent me too. its fully written, very thorough. i wrote the wiki entry for zenwalk on broadcom drivers...its very simple. to anyone i know who i do work for with windows, they couldnt do it, and thus wouldnt use ubuntu. end of story.
2007-03-21T15:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rhys	bottom line is, especially with a distro that has great community support like Ubuntu, finding answers to problems is usually a google search away
2007-03-21T16:01:00.000Z	rhys	IndyGunFreak	thats great. untill its a click away, they wont use ubuntu. microsoft can make crap software because thats all the user knows exists. check the precent of the population, the consumer population who knows about the existance of ubuntu, moreless linux.
2007-03-22T16:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rhys	unfortunately that true, and personally, i think the distros they sell at the store(linspire and Mandriva), are absolutely awful, but if you find Xandros, its not bad
2007-03-22T16:02:00.000Z	rhys	IndyGunFreak	noone knows what those are either. What ubuntu needs, any distro, is massive marketing. Codings great, and for distros like mine, zenwalk.
2007-03-22T16:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rhys	thing is, Marketing costs $$,
2007-03-22T16:03:00.000Z	rhys	IndyGunFreak	your right. and thats why M$ is great today, for marketing. not the product. business and marketing.
