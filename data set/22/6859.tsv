2006-07-29T12:10:00.000Z	eyequeue	dmsantam	i so mine in dselect spurts on a new install, a bit from this section, process it, a bit from that
2006-07-29T12:14:00.000Z	eyequeue	dmsantam	i think the firefox security upgrade was in the last 24h
2006-07-29T12:14:00.000Z	dmsantam	eyequeue	ok, cool.
2006-07-29T12:14:00.000Z	eyequeue	dmsantam	mine doesn't feel any faster or slower though yet
2006-07-29T12:15:00.000Z	dmsantam	eyequeue	how much memory is it using?
2006-07-29T12:15:00.000Z	eyequeue	dmsantam	wait, ff was a couple days back and thunderbird was today, that could be it
2006-07-29T12:16:00.000Z	dmsantam	eyequeue	sounds right :)
2006-07-29T12:16:00.000Z	eyequeue	dmsantam	how do i get a per-app memory use for a gui app?
2006-07-29T12:16:00.000Z	dmsantam	eyequeue	i just look at "top"
2006-07-29T12:17:00.000Z	eyequeue	dmsantam	 5249 user1000  16   0  866m  98m  20m R 17.0 21.0  28:45.80 /usr/lib/firefox/fi
2006-07-29T12:18:00.000Z	dmsantam	eyequeue	seems high!
2006-07-29T12:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	dmsantam	yeah, but to me ff is always high
2006-07-29T12:19:00.000Z	dmsantam	eyequeue	the whole point of firefox was meant to be lite
2006-07-29T12:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	dmsantam	i'd say s/lite/safe/ heh
2006-07-29T12:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	dmsantam	any big gui app will never feel lite to this console junkie, heh
2006-07-29T12:26:00.000Z	dmsantam	eyequeue	use \<word\>
2006-07-29T12:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	dmsantam	ah
2006-07-29T12:26:00.000Z	dmsantam	eyequeue	word boundaries for vim :)
2006-07-29T12:27:00.000Z	eyequeue	dmsantam	vcre? :) s/perl/vim/ compatible regular expressions? :)
2006-07-29T12:32:00.000Z	dmsantam	eyequeue	yep
2006-08-31T08:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	dmsantam	install with the server cd in that case
2006-08-31T08:50:00.000Z	dmsantam	eyequeue	yes, but cubuntu is such a catchy name
