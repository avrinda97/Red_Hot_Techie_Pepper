2008-08-28T17:44:00.000Z	Denise		can i connect on a satellite with wifi radar?
2008-08-28T17:44:00.000Z	Denise		I thought satellites were wireless
2008-08-28T17:44:00.000Z	Denise		lol
2008-08-28T17:45:00.000Z	Denise		awe
2008-08-28T17:45:00.000Z	Denise		and how I reach them?
2008-08-28T17:46:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	using Ã¼berspeshel satellite internet hardware, I suppose.
2008-08-28T17:47:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	probably, if the provider is happy about it.
2008-08-28T17:48:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	you're saying your neighbour has satellite internet and you want to piggyback?
2008-08-28T17:50:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	or you could plug a router to the satellite modem and connect multiple machines to the router.
2008-08-28T17:50:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	not sure how that works either.
2008-08-28T17:51:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	I suppose your provider would help with this...
2008-08-28T17:54:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	conceptually, but I guess that satellite broadband is pretty much still very proprietary in terms of techs and protocols and so you might have problems getting it to work with other stuff.
2008-08-28T17:55:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	probably. It would come with a big shiney dish.
2008-08-28T17:56:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	so your neighbour already has satellite internet?
2008-08-28T17:58:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	that's what a router does. It lets many machines share one internet link.
2008-08-28T18:00:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	a modem only goes to one machine, etc.
2008-08-28T18:00:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	I suppose you could connect the modem to a router, although I'm not sure how you would specifically accomplish that.
2008-08-28T18:00:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	could what be outside of what?
2008-08-28T18:01:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	the dish obviously should be outside to get a clear signal...
2008-08-28T18:10:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	common wireless hardware have limited communication range.
2008-08-28T18:10:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	how far apart are the houses?
2008-08-28T18:25:00.000Z	Jafet	Denise	ask your provider, who probably have techs at disposal to help you.
