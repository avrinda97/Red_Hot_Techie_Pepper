2005-09-11T10:56:00.000Z	Hoxzer		what could be the problem If I just simply login and then the Gnome Desktop bar wont load and I only see my mouse and background. I can't also acces to the virtual consoles with "ctrl+alt+f's"
2005-09-11T10:56:00.000Z	Hoxzer		Answer......
2005-09-11T10:57:00.000Z	nlogax	Hoxzer	do you know another user account? can you log into Gnome with it?
2005-09-11T10:57:00.000Z	Hoxzer	nlogax	actually I just installed it to that PC so no
2005-09-11T10:59:00.000Z	Hoxzer	nlogax	as I said virtual consoles wont work :<
2005-09-11T10:59:00.000Z	nlogax	Hoxzer	just checking you knew how to access them
2005-09-11T10:59:00.000Z	nlogax	Hoxzer	ok, so before you login
2005-09-11T11:00:00.000Z	Hoxzer	nlogax	do what?
2005-09-11T11:00:00.000Z	nlogax	Hoxzer	create a new user on the system from the CLI and then try logging in with it
2005-09-11T11:00:00.000Z	nlogax	Hoxzer	but it sounds as if X is locking your system solid
2005-09-11T11:02:00.000Z	nlogax	Hoxzer	also look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log for evidence of problems
2005-09-11T11:03:00.000Z	nlogax	Hoxzer	useradd and adduser both seem to be there - you'll need to use sudo of course
2005-09-11T11:07:00.000Z	nlogax	Hoxzer	yes it sounds like X is dying really badly - did you look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
2005-09-11T11:08:00.000Z	nlogax	Hoxzer	also, what changed since your system was working last?
2005-09-11T11:08:00.000Z	Hoxzer	nlogax	nope
2005-09-11T11:08:00.000Z	Hoxzer	nlogax	my system hasn't been working
2005-09-11T11:09:00.000Z	nlogax	Hoxzer	Was it a fresh install to a freshly-formatted partition?
2005-09-11T11:09:00.000Z	Hoxzer	nlogax	I splitted my HDD in two partions one was my for my XP install 30GB and one for ubuntu 10GB
2005-09-11T11:11:00.000Z	nlogax	Hoxzer	- what sort of vid car you got?
2005-09-11T11:11:00.000Z	Hoxzer	nlogax	6800 le @ 6800
2005-09-11T11:13:00.000Z	nlogax	Hoxzer	do you know how to switch to our private channel? (query) ?
