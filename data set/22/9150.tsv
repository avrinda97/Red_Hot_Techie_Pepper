2005-02-20T16:50:00.000Z	lx_		heya, If openoffice won't open a word document that i need to edit, what other program should i use?
2005-02-20T16:50:00.000Z	lx_		k
2005-02-20T16:50:00.000Z	lx_		is it in the repositories?
2005-02-20T16:50:00.000Z	haggai	lx_	openoffice.org2
2005-02-20T16:55:00.000Z	haggai	lx_	well, you can't install the package from universe, but you could try my vanilla .debs
2005-02-20T16:56:00.000Z	lx_	haggai	what is that?  my vanilla .debs?
2005-02-20T16:56:00.000Z	haggai	lx_	plain, unpatched but packaged for debian
2005-02-20T16:57:00.000Z	haggai	lx_	I haven't tested against warty but the dependencies aren't very heavy so there is a fair chance it will work
2005-02-20T16:57:00.000Z	haggai	lx_	you'll need -core and -writer
2005-02-20T16:59:00.000Z	lx_	haggai	looking into it, thanks
2005-02-20T16:59:00.000Z	lx_	haggai	only core and writer?
2005-02-20T17:00:00.000Z	haggai	lx_	yes that will give you .doc import capability, I would try installing just those two to begin with - you can add the rest later if it works
2005-02-20T17:00:00.000Z	haggai	lx_	please let me know if it works for you
2005-02-20T17:01:00.000Z	lx_	haggai	i have never installed a file like this before
2005-02-20T17:02:00.000Z	haggai	lx_	add the deb line to your sources.list and then you'll see the new packages in your package manager
2005-02-20T17:04:00.000Z	lx_	haggai	so i don't download them?
2005-02-20T17:05:00.000Z	haggai	lx_	apt/aptitude/synaptic does that for you
2005-02-20T17:06:00.000Z	lx_	haggai	i know that... just used to downloading things to install... wasn't sure if i had to download first
2005-02-20T17:16:00.000Z	lx_	haggai	almost done . . .
2005-02-20T17:17:00.000Z	lx_	haggai	actually gonna take awhile to download it...
2005-02-20T17:19:00.000Z	lx_	haggai	in 30 min i will let you know if it worked  . .
2005-02-20T17:28:00.000Z	haggai	lx_	thanks
