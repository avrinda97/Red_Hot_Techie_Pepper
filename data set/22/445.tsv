2011-09-28T11:20:00.000Z	thenickperson	paulus68	one question. in the else part of that, there are references to three conky startup scripts. I just use .conkyrc, is that alright?
2011-09-28T11:21:00.000Z	thenickperson	paulus68	also, why "killall conky"?
2011-09-28T11:23:00.000Z	paulus68	thenickperson	you just use 1 then as this is an example, if there is a conky running these instances will be killed first before launching a fresh one
2011-09-28T11:24:00.000Z	thenickperson	paulus68	do I just add that script to startup items and log in? and ah, thanks, I realize that guy uses 3 configs while I just use one
2011-09-28T11:25:00.000Z	paulus68	thenickperson	yes and as mentioned before this is an example, if you have the time to go through this post on the forum then you might some nice and interesting things that you can do with conky
2011-09-28T11:25:00.000Z	paulus68	thenickperson	brb
2011-09-28T11:25:00.000Z	thenickperson	paulus68	thanks, I'll try this out now
2011-09-28T11:28:00.000Z	thenickperson	paulus68	I logged in with the script, but conky just did what it would do without sleep. it displays the moment I log in to my account, and stays open, but is completely hidden once nautilus starts the desktop.
2011-09-28T11:30:00.000Z	thenickperson	paulus68	going to try again, this time with sleep and conky in a shell script
2011-09-28T11:31:00.000Z	thenickperson	paulus68	whoah, it's working apparently! o_o
2011-09-28T11:32:00.000Z	paulus68	thenickperson	glad to hear that
2011-09-28T11:34:00.000Z	paulus68	thenickperson	I think adapt the sleep might be able to help you
2011-09-28T11:34:00.000Z	thenickperson	paulus68	I mean, I can just change the value for sleep to anything, I just thought that would be a cool hack if possible
2011-09-28T11:35:00.000Z	paulus68	thenickperson	yes
2011-09-28T11:38:00.000Z	thenickperson	paulus68	well this does work, thanks
