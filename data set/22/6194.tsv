2006-12-05T07:41:00.000Z	frying_fish		don't need that with ubuntu
2006-12-05T07:41:00.000Z	frying_fish		there is a packaged ati driver in linux-restricted-modules
2006-12-05T07:41:00.000Z	frying_fish		!ati
2006-12-05T07:41:00.000Z	frying_fish		or look there for it.
2006-12-05T07:42:00.000Z	frying_fish		ps2 kit isn't hotpluggable from what I remember
2006-12-05T07:42:00.000Z	frying_fish		see if it works then.
2006-12-05T07:42:00.000Z	Randakar	frying_fish	thanks, I was wondering if there was a question bot around ;-)
2006-12-05T08:12:00.000Z	Randakar	frying_fish	I dislike sudo, frankly. I tend to do 10-20 commands as root, then sudo is just inefficient
2006-12-05T08:12:00.000Z	frying_fish	Randakar	not really inefficient
2006-12-05T08:13:00.000Z	Randakar	frying_fish	sudo bash :-)
2006-12-05T08:13:00.000Z	Randakar	frying_fish	true enough.
2006-12-05T08:14:00.000Z	Randakar	frying_fish	"su -" is even less characters :-)
2006-12-05T08:14:00.000Z	frying_fish	Randakar	true, but, since root isn't enabled by default.
2006-12-05T08:15:00.000Z	Randakar	frying_fish	yeah, that's why I don't recommend it to people who are just starting ;-)
2006-12-05T08:18:00.000Z	Randakar	frying_fish	I'd make that 'aptitude install acroread'
2006-12-05T08:18:00.000Z	frying_fish	Randakar	well yeah, sometimes I do that
2006-12-05T08:18:00.000Z	Randakar	frying_fish	apt-get is nice, but it doesn't mark dependencies as automatically installed (which is logical because it doesn't know about that)
2006-12-05T08:18:00.000Z	frying_fish	Randakar	true.
2006-12-05T08:19:00.000Z	Randakar	frying_fish	I recently did a cleanup where every installed package was marked as automatically installed, unless I decided it wasn't ;-)
2006-12-05T08:19:00.000Z	frying_fish	Randakar	:)
2006-12-05T08:19:00.000Z	Randakar	frying_fish	that got rid of a _lot_ of lib*-dev packages
2006-12-05T08:20:00.000Z	frying_fish	Randakar	I suppose I should go through at some point and get rid of all the stuff I don't need.
