2007-03-05T15:38:00.000Z	Kronuz		can I install Ubuntu (or any other linux for that matter) without errasing my current RAIDs ?

2007-03-05T15:39:00.000Z	Kronuz		hey, I'm checking a video of Beryl... it looks great
2007-03-05T15:39:00.000Z	Kronuz		NVIDIA GeForce 6600 or something
2007-03-05T15:40:00.000Z	Kronuz		hey, has anyone by any chance used UltraEdit 32 for windows ?
2007-03-05T15:40:00.000Z	Kronuz		I'd be looking for an editor like that one
2007-03-05T15:41:00.000Z	Kronuz		I'm definitely trying Ubuntu... Vista was too expensive... and ugly :(
2007-03-05T15:42:00.000Z	Kronuz		I bet you've been getting a lot more visits since the Vista realeas, right? :P
2007-03-05T15:42:00.000Z	Kronuz		can I instal Ubuntu from the LiveCD? is the LiveCD all I have to get?
