2009-12-21T20:21:00.000Z	creature		How long should an encrypted swap partition of 1GB take to start during the boot process? (Yes, I know this is a vague question. I'm looking for a ballpark figure.)
2009-12-21T20:21:00.000Z	richthegeek1	creature	encrypted swap?
2009-12-21T20:21:00.000Z	creature	richthegeek1	Yes. I'm not sure what your implicit question is here.
2009-12-21T20:22:00.000Z	richthegeek1	creature	why encrypt your swap?
2009-12-21T20:22:00.000Z	richthegeek1	creature	just interested, don't have a clue how long it should take to swapon
2009-12-21T20:23:00.000Z	creature	richthegeek1	swap's essentially memory, so it gets sensitive details written to it. Passwords, credit card details, open files, that kind of thing.
2009-12-21T20:23:00.000Z	creature	richthegeek1	So the answer to 'why' is somewhere between 'peace of mind' and 'paranoia'.
2009-12-21T20:24:00.000Z	richthegeek1	creature	protected memory spaces means nothing else can read it (technically), and swap gets wiped
2009-12-21T20:24:00.000Z	richthegeek1	creature	and if you a reasonable amount of RAM swap doesn't even get used
2009-12-21T20:25:00.000Z	creature	richthegeek1	Well, if "they've" got access to a running system you're probably out of luck anyway. If the power gets yanked, though, you can read data out of a swap partition fairly easily.
2009-12-21T20:26:00.000Z	richthegeek1	creature	I suppose... seems quite an odd level of paranoia
2009-12-21T20:26:00.000Z	richthegeek1	creature	if they are in a position to yank your power they'll just twat you with a wrench till you *tell* them the passwords
2009-12-21T20:27:00.000Z	creature	richthegeek1	Ah, that's the joy of it, though! Because you never need to remount swap (it gets cleared on boot) you use /dev/urandom as the key.
2009-12-21T20:27:00.000Z	creature	richthegeek1	Same for /tmp. dm-crypt has options for both â€“ tmp just makes a new filesystem on each boot.
2009-12-21T20:27:00.000Z	richthegeek1	creature	what is so important that you have to go to this level of security?
2009-12-21T20:28:00.000Z	richthegeek1	creature	simply by not using Windows you're ahead of 99% of all users
2009-12-21T20:29:00.000Z	creature	richthegeek1	I appreciate the knowledge that if my computer gets swiped it's solely a material loss, and I don't have to worry about losing sensitive data.
2009-12-21T20:29:00.000Z	richthegeek1	creature	criminals can linux?
2009-12-21T20:37:00.000Z	creature	richthegeek1	Indeed. Lungan: As richthegeek says.
2009-12-21T20:37:00.000Z	richthegeek1	creature	wooo I rock
2009-12-21T20:39:00.000Z	richthegeek1	creature	just tried with two songs and the length in totem is wrong.. seems to play fine though
2009-12-21T20:39:00.000Z	richthegeek1	creature	is there a way to edit ID3 tags?
