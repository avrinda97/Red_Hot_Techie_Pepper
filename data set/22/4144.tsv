2008-03-07T22:16:00.000Z	Bigg400		I have unformatted space on the same drive as I have ubuntu installed on... when I format it to ext3 I still have no access to it or permissions to copy any files to it
2008-03-07T22:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bigg400	make folders (with sudo) inside the partition and give correct owner and permisions to that folders
2008-03-07T22:19:00.000Z	Bigg400	erUSUL	no harm but that sounds like an awful amount of mucking about
2008-03-07T22:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bigg400	security has its price
2008-03-07T22:21:00.000Z	Bigg400	erUSUL	can I not just have an ext3 partition that I can write too.... you see I'm planning on running VM images on that partition so I dont want vmware complaining about it... the work load in permissions seems like over kill and way too much work for adding something as simple as a little extra storage :S
2008-03-07T22:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bigg400	sudo mkdir /path/to/mount/point/newfolder && sudo chown youruser:yoouruser /path/to/mount/point/newfolder
2008-03-07T22:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bigg400	you are done newfolder is all yours just like your home copy files vmimages all you want to it
2008-03-07T22:24:00.000Z	Bigg400	erUSUL	so the permissions of other files will not be created
2008-03-07T22:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bigg400	even better 'ln -s /path/to/mount/point/newfolder ~/VMwareimages'
2008-03-07T22:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bigg400	and you access it through a folder 8link) on you home folder... ;P
2008-03-07T22:26:00.000Z	Bigg400	erUSUL	the problem is I do not have enough space on my current ubuntu partition to create a VM.. hence the extra space
2008-03-07T22:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bigg400	i have give you the steps to solve cleanly your problem
2008-03-07T22:27:00.000Z	Bigg400	erUSUL	oh I know :P just lettin ye know
2008-03-07T22:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bigg400	XD
2008-03-07T22:28:00.000Z	Bigg400	erUSUL	I will get this printer working yet... hence the vm :D
2008-03-07T22:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bigg400	so everything boils dwon to a rebel printer??
2008-03-07T22:31:00.000Z	Bigg400	erUSUL	yep... and my own want to destroy or learn :)
2008-03-07T22:37:00.000Z	Bigg400	erUSUL	nice one... great idea too with the sym links :)
2008-03-07T22:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bigg400	;P
2008-03-07T22:40:00.000Z	Bigg400	erUSUL	yeah vmware is complaining about permissions.. cannot create the image :(
2008-03-07T22:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bigg400	have you've done everything i said; especifically the chown of the folder
2008-03-07T22:41:00.000Z	Bigg400	erUSUL	yes... to the letter..
