2006-11-08T16:16:00.000Z	JohnM555		Why does so much of this for setting up wireless expect people to have internet access, when they need wireless to get to the internet?
2006-11-08T16:17:00.000Z	JohnM555		Ok
2006-11-08T16:17:00.000Z	variant	JohnM555	yes, its a very annoying situation. caused entirely by the hardware manufacturers, it will probably be annohter year before it's surpased the ease with which windows users handle wifi
2006-11-08T16:18:00.000Z	variant	JohnM555	laptops
2006-11-08T16:18:00.000Z	variant	JohnM555	what diference does that make?
2006-11-08T16:19:00.000Z	variant	JohnM555	i am typeing this on a laptop, how many business men have you seen take a desktop pc to a meeting or conference? (none)
2006-11-08T16:20:00.000Z	variant	JohnM555	hundereds of millions of people use laptops
2006-11-08T16:20:00.000Z	JohnM555	variant	I'm just saying I think a lot of people using Ubuntu would use it on a desktop, thats all
2006-11-08T16:20:00.000Z	JohnM555	variant	I'm on a laptop right now! I know tons of people use laptops
2006-11-08T16:20:00.000Z	variant	JohnM555	if you like, but i dont see what difference it makes as to whether or not you use ubuntu if you have a desktop or a laptop
2006-11-08T16:22:00.000Z	variant	JohnM555	what? gnome-network-manager?
2006-11-08T16:24:00.000Z	JohnM555	variant	I think its gnome
2006-11-08T16:24:00.000Z	variant	JohnM555	type apt-get install network-manager-gnome
2006-11-08T16:24:00.000Z	variant	JohnM555	tip: in irc type var and press the tab key
2006-11-08T16:25:00.000Z	JohnM555	variant	Oh, nice. Sorry for mistyping :)
2006-11-08T16:25:00.000Z	JohnM555	variant	shouldn't double clicking the deb also install it?
2006-11-08T16:25:00.000Z	variant	JohnM555	use the package manager
2006-11-08T16:26:00.000Z	JohnM555	variant	I can do that with stuff already on my computer? I transfered it via usb because my ubuntu isn't connected to the internet
2006-11-08T16:27:00.000Z	variant	JohnM555	ah, thats annoying. put it in /var/cache/apt/archives/
2006-11-08T16:27:00.000Z	variant	JohnM555	but it wont work unless its the package version that apt-get wants
2006-11-08T16:28:00.000Z	JohnM555	variant	OK I'll try that
2006-11-08T16:33:00.000Z	JohnM555	variant	I tried puting the deb in the directory you told me, but I couldn't even copy and paste it there :\
