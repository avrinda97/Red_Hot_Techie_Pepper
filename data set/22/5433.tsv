2007-05-29T08:57:00.000Z	Gnea	RAOF	for SLI?
2007-05-29T09:00:00.000Z	Gnea	RAOF	it's nvidia, they support it.
2007-05-29T09:01:00.000Z	RAOF	Gnea	Yeah, but for the programs you want to run?  Last I heard (which was *some* time ago), the nvidia drivers had to explicitly support SLI with the app you wanted to use
2007-05-29T09:01:00.000Z	Gnea	RAOF	and you heard this from where?
2007-05-29T09:02:00.000Z	RAOF	Gnea	From like, the internets.  Fairly reputable sites, I think (hardocp, anandtech?)
2007-05-29T09:02:00.000Z	Gnea	RAOF	please, show me a url.
2007-05-29T09:02:00.000Z	RAOF	Gnea	I can't.  As I said, *some* time ago :)
2007-05-29T09:02:00.000Z	Gnea	RAOF	then i don't believe you. :)
2007-05-29T09:05:00.000Z	RAOF	Gnea	Bwa ha ha!  Google to the rescue!  http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=2358&p=21
2007-05-29T09:05:00.000Z	RAOF	Gnea	Still, a somewhat old link :)
2007-05-29T09:05:00.000Z	Gnea	RAOF	yes, he can.
2007-05-29T09:07:00.000Z	RAOF	Gnea	Really?  If he's installed Ubuntu on the same partition as windows was?  At best, he'll recover some fraction of his files.
2007-05-29T09:07:00.000Z	Gnea	RAOF	true, it's a matter of chance
2007-05-29T09:09:00.000Z	RAOF	Gnea	Because by using the system you will be killing the data you are trying to find.  The safest thing would be to pull the harddrive, and take it to an expert.
2007-05-29T09:20:00.000Z	Gnea	RAOF	amd64 dosn't count, it's not mainstream yet.
2007-05-29T09:21:00.000Z	Gnea	RAOF	not everyone can afford to.
2007-05-29T09:21:00.000Z	RAOF	Gnea	No, it's not that I'm refusing to support both platforms.  I just *don't know* why it doesn't work on i386!
2007-05-29T09:22:00.000Z	Gnea	RAOF	what sort of error reports do you pay attention to?
2007-05-29T09:23:00.000Z	RAOF	Gnea	I *am* paying attention to that bug.  But I can't single-handedly fix democracyplayer.  None of the upstream versions work properly on feisty.
2007-05-29T09:24:00.000Z	RAOF	Gnea	As soon as there's a version of democracy player that is released and actually *works* with python2.5/recent dbus I'll package it up.
2007-05-29T09:24:00.000Z	Gnea	RAOF	i think we have part of the problem right there-> http://dpaste.com/11213/
2007-05-29T09:43:00.000Z	Gnea	RAOF	i loathe generalizations :)
