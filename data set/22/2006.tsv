2009-12-07T19:18:00.000Z	aperson	meowbuntu	one would think
2009-12-07T19:48:00.000Z	aperson	meowbuntu	flashplugin isn't free software
2009-12-07T19:49:00.000Z	aperson	meowbuntu	I've had it happen before :)
2009-12-07T19:49:00.000Z	meowbuntu	aperson	i had no problems in mint 7 with it what up
2009-12-07T19:49:00.000Z	aperson	meowbuntu	mint distributes lots of non-free stuff
2009-12-07T19:49:00.000Z	meowbuntu	aperson	any fixes
2009-12-07T19:50:00.000Z	aperson	meowbuntu	install flashplugin-nonfree
2009-12-07T19:50:00.000Z	aperson	meowbuntu	yeah, any ubuntu derivative can use them
2009-12-07T19:50:00.000Z	aperson	meowbuntu	that point is moot
2009-12-07T19:51:00.000Z	aperson	meowbuntu	what Dr_Willis said is also very true
2009-12-07T19:53:00.000Z	aperson	meowbuntu	install flashplugin-nonfree
2009-12-07T19:53:00.000Z	aperson	meowbuntu	it's illegal to distribute it, but you can still install it
2009-12-07T19:53:00.000Z	aperson	meowbuntu	flashplugin-nonfree will download and install it for you
2009-12-07T19:53:00.000Z	meowbuntu	aperson	and i would have to install the other flash plugin to stop conflicts
2009-12-07T19:54:00.000Z	aperson	meowbuntu	that *is* the flash plugin
2009-12-07T19:55:00.000Z	meowbuntu	aperson	mint has bothe a free and non free flashplugin. ubuntu only has nonfree
2009-12-07T19:55:00.000Z	aperson	meowbuntu	there is only the nonfree one
2009-12-07T19:56:00.000Z	meowbuntu	aperson	you should consult the mint repos then there is 2  there
2009-12-07T19:56:00.000Z	aperson	meowbuntu	howabout just install flashplugin-nonfree and not worry about it :)
