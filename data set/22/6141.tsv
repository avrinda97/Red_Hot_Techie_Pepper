2009-05-04T07:34:00.000Z	n2diy	sebsebseb	yes, but an mbr virus will effect both partitions.
2009-05-04T07:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	n2diy	why not put Windows inside a virtual machine inside Ubuntu? fine for everything except like 3D games
2009-05-04T07:35:00.000Z	n2diy	sebsebseb	that is the suggestion I was looking for, have a link to a howto or something?
2009-05-04T07:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	n2diy	in fact I would rather not suppourt Windows these days, unless people are  dual booting with a better OS, or  running  Windows in a virtual machine, inside a better OS
