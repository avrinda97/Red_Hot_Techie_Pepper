2007-03-22T11:34:00.000Z	nitrolinken		It jsut freezes, in revovery mode now
2007-03-22T11:35:00.000Z	nitrolinken		Is there no way, at all, to simply change the icon theme through termn?
2007-03-22T11:35:00.000Z	nitrolinken		Or a line in a file, that I can just edit?
2007-03-22T11:36:00.000Z	nitrolinken		hm.
2007-03-22T11:36:00.000Z	nitrolinken		okey, I'll try.
2007-03-22T11:36:00.000Z	nitrolinken		gnome-panel*
2007-03-22T11:37:00.000Z	nitrolinken		But gnome isn't broke, it just can't load the icon theme, and therefor crashes
2007-03-22T11:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	nitrolinken	You can change the icon theme from command line with: gconftool-2 --type string --set /desktop/gnome/interface/icon_theme "name_of_them_here"
2007-03-22T11:38:00.000Z	nitrolinken	ardchoille	Where string is the name of the theme?
2007-03-22T11:39:00.000Z	ardchoille	nitrolinken	No the name of the theme goes in the double quotes
2007-03-22T11:39:00.000Z	nitrolinken	ardchoille	ok, I'll try
2007-03-22T11:40:00.000Z	nitrolinken		brb
2007-03-22T11:40:00.000Z	nitrolinken		thanks for the help mbdl, disasm and ardchoille
2007-03-22T11:40:00.000Z	ardchoille	nitrolinken	I hope it works
2007-03-22T11:44:00.000Z	nitrolinken	ardchoille	If the icon theme is Micro, then I'd just enter Micro there? Because I tried, ran gdm, and it freezes on login
2007-03-22T11:45:00.000Z	nitrolinken		hang on
2007-03-22T11:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	nitrolinken	Are you sure you have the theme name spelled right? Including upper/lower case? If so, it may not be the icon theme causing the rpboelm.
2007-03-22T11:46:00.000Z	nitrolinken		heh
2007-03-22T11:48:00.000Z	nitrolinken		Anyone?
2007-03-22T11:58:00.000Z	nitrolinken		okey
2007-03-22T11:59:00.000Z	nitrolinken	ardchoille	The command you gave me didn't give any error, but it dodn't excatly work.
