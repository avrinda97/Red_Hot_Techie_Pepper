2005-11-24T17:29:00.000Z	blanky		this is what pisses me off about linux, the only thing that does; there's no sure way of removing a program
2005-11-24T17:30:00.000Z	blanky		I tried to remove kde by removing purging kubuntu-desktop, and I restart, and go to sessions and KDE is still there
2005-11-24T17:30:00.000Z	Hobbsee	blanky	aptitude remove kubuntu-desktop
2005-12-01T12:36:00.000Z	Hobbsee	blanky	follow the tutorial on it?
2005-12-01T12:36:00.000Z	blanky	Hobbsee	can you please point me to it?
2005-12-01T12:37:00.000Z	Hobbsee	blanky	http://www.linux-gamers.net/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=45
2007-01-16T10:08:00.000Z	Hobbsee	blanky	that's rubbish.
2007-01-16T10:08:00.000Z	blanky	Hobbsee	sorry what'd I say
2007-01-16T10:09:00.000Z	blanky	Hobbsee	it was a joke :P
2007-01-16T10:10:00.000Z	Hobbsee	blanky	maybe to you.  however lots of other people are going to believe it, and try to get help there
2007-01-16T10:10:00.000Z	blanky	Hobbsee	oh, sorry :(
2007-01-16T10:10:00.000Z	Hobbsee	blanky	actually - you get more help here - in +1, they basically tell you not to run feisty if you cant solve basic problems, and send you back to #ubuntu.
2007-01-16T10:11:00.000Z	blanky	Hobbsee	guess it was different when dapper was +1 :(
2007-01-16T10:11:00.000Z	Hobbsee	blanky	which is entirely logical, of course.  new people and people who dont know what they're doing should go back to a stable release.
2007-01-16T10:11:00.000Z	Hobbsee	blanky	well, more people were there.  but that was later in the development cycle anyway
2007-01-16T10:38:00.000Z	blanky	Hobbsee	thanks man
2007-01-16T10:37:00.000Z	Hobbsee	blanky	#ubuntu-devel.  it's not for support.
2007-01-16T10:37:00.000Z	blanky	Hobbsee	I know, haha
2007-01-16T10:38:00.000Z	blanky	Hobbsee	fine, if I do sudo apt-get source blah, where does the source download to?!
2007-01-16T10:38:00.000Z	Hobbsee	blanky	/var/cache/apt/archives
2007-01-16T10:38:00.000Z	Hobbsee	blanky	oh wait, source.
2007-01-16T10:38:00.000Z	Hobbsee	blanky	that was the binaries.  source downloads to the current directory.
