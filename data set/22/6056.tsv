2007-01-05T15:11:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	imbecile	^^
2007-01-05T15:11:00.000Z	imbecile	tonyyarusso	 thanks again man, you rock
2007-01-08T16:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	imbecile	What's not working with it?
2007-01-08T16:57:00.000Z	imbecile	tonyyarusso	 i cant view the seperate access points (except in networking but i cant connect) and i cant get keyring to initialize.. pretty much the whole thing isnt working

2007-01-09T17:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	imbecile	Had you followed the wiki directions first?
2007-01-09T17:03:00.000Z	imbecile	tonyyarusso	 nope i suppose i had better try that.. i have rebooted over 30 times with different configs
2007-01-09T17:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	imbecile	Well, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkManager then
2007-01-09T17:05:00.000Z	imbecile	tonyyarusso	 thanks alot man
2007-02-06T13:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	imbecile	most likely
2007-02-06T13:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	imbecile	One good way to find out commands is to do 'dpgk -L <packagename> | grep bin'
2007-02-06T13:24:00.000Z	imbecile	tonyyarusso	 thanks
2007-02-06T13:32:00.000Z	imbecile	tonyyarusso	dpgk -L asterisk | grep bin ?
2007-02-06T13:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	imbecile	if the package is asterisk, which I think is right
2007-02-06T13:35:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	imbecile	a sec...
2007-02-06T13:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	imbecile	that should work....  dpkg -L asterisk | grep bin should take the output of dpkg -L asterisk, pipe it to grep, which will return any results with bin in the path
2007-02-06T13:38:00.000Z	imbecile	tonyyarusso	 maybe i didnt install it correctly :(
2007-02-06T13:39:00.000Z	imbecile	tonyyarusso	 ahhh you typoed the first time
2007-02-06T13:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	imbecile	ohp, whoops
