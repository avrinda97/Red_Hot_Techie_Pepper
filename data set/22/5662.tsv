2007-10-13T10:21:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	Ashfire908	as you seem to know something, can you help me with a mount error
2007-10-13T10:22:00.000Z	Ashfire908	q_a_z_steve	what is the issue
2007-10-13T10:23:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	Ashfire908	^^^
2007-10-13T10:23:00.000Z	Ashfire908	q_a_z_steve	you need to mount an ntfs drive?
2007-10-13T10:24:00.000Z	Ashfire908	q_a_z_steve	what command did you use, and why are you running dapper?
2007-10-13T10:24:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	Ashfire908	LTS.
2007-10-13T10:24:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	Ashfire908	Places > (Mount is called VISTA) > get error I showed you.
2007-10-13T10:25:00.000Z	Ashfire908	q_a_z_steve	LTS just means longer support, it does not mean it's better or more stable
2007-10-13T10:26:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	Ashfire908	LTS = I don't have to upgrade as often...
2007-10-13T10:26:00.000Z	Ashfire908	q_a_z_steve	did you try manually mounting it?
2007-10-13T10:26:00.000Z	Ashfire908	q_a_z_steve	is only if you need a stable system.
2007-10-13T10:27:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	Ashfire908	doesn't everyone need a stable system???
2007-10-13T10:27:00.000Z	Ashfire908	q_a_z_steve	type mount in a terminal
2007-10-13T10:28:00.000Z	Ashfire908	q_a_z_steve	dapper is like server level OMG IF IT GOES DOWN MY LIFE IS OVER
2007-10-13T10:30:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	Ashfire908	^^
2007-10-13T10:31:00.000Z	Ashfire908	q_a_z_steve	cause it's not mounted!
2007-10-13T10:31:00.000Z	Ashfire908	q_a_z_steve	where do you want to mount it to
2007-10-13T10:31:00.000Z	Ashfire908	q_a_z_steve	type sudo mount /dev/hdb5 /vista
2007-10-13T10:32:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	Ashfire908	I knew it wasn't mounted, and I assume it won't show in 'mount' as I don't know FS and so on.
2007-10-13T10:32:00.000Z	Ashfire908	q_a_z_steve	type sudo mount /dev/hdb5 /vista
2007-10-13T10:33:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	Ashfire908	mount point doesn't exist, can I create it?
2007-10-13T10:34:00.000Z	Ashfire908	q_a_z_steve	did you mean the mount point is /mnt/vista or /mount/vista?
