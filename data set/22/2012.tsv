2009-11-27T11:04:00.000Z	kevdog		does ubuntu supply libs with their mingw32 packages?  Is this the correct channel to ask this?
2009-11-27T11:06:00.000Z	kevdog		Flare_laptop: where because within my /usr/i586-mingw32msvc directory I'm not finding a pkgconfig or sys-root directory!
2009-11-27T11:06:00.000Z	kevdog		Flare_Laptop: I'm wondering if this might not be the correct channel to ask this
2009-11-27T11:07:00.000Z	Younder	kevdog	mingw32 is a windows library
2009-11-27T11:07:00.000Z	kevdog	Younder	Yes I'm trying to cross compile
2009-11-27T11:07:00.000Z	kevdog	Younder	Yes I'm trying to cross compile Handbrake
2009-11-27T11:08:00.000Z	Younder	kevdog	first and formost you need the cross compiler version of gcc
2009-11-27T11:08:00.000Z	kevdog	Younder	Doesnt mingw provide this?
2009-11-27T11:09:00.000Z	Younder	kevdog	though since you are using the same processor (ix86) it is mostly for setting some parameters
2009-11-27T11:10:00.000Z	Younder	kevdog	mingw32 is a minimal gcc environment for windows
2009-11-27T11:10:00.000Z	Younder	kevdog	as such it doesn't cross compile
2009-11-27T11:11:00.000Z	Younder	kevdog	but, if I understand you correctly you want to PORT a linux app Handbrake to Windows?
2009-11-27T11:11:00.000Z	kevdog	Younder	yes
2009-11-27T11:12:00.000Z	kevdog	Younder	cross compile -- which they have some instructions on the Handbrake site how to do -- but it seems mingw32 installed from repository doesn't come with a full set of libraries on ubuntu
2009-11-27T11:13:00.000Z	Younder	kevdog	a cross compile is translating from one processor arcitecture to another
2009-11-27T11:13:00.000Z	Younder	kevdog	you are PORTing software..

2009-11-27T11:18:00.000Z	kevdog	Younder	those links -- which Ive seen are pretty old --
2009-11-27T11:18:00.000Z	Younder	kevdog	November 27, 2009
2009-11-27T11:19:00.000Z	kevdog	Younder	Hmm the original threads were 2006
2009-11-27T11:22:00.000Z	kevdog	Younder	Ive read wiki on cross-compiling -- and it seems like thats what I'm doing
