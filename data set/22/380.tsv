2011-11-04T06:25:00.000Z	bjrohan		I need some serious help
2011-11-04T06:25:00.000Z	bjrohan		I am not sure what I did, but everything on my desktp disappeared, I mean the unity launcherbar, and the bar across the top that has my name, battery status, etc
2011-11-04T06:26:00.000Z	bjrohan		I am new to Ubuntu, so I do not know much about the terms
2011-11-04T06:26:00.000Z	bjrohan		CCSM?
2011-11-04T06:26:00.000Z	bjrohan		I was using Compiz
2011-11-04T06:27:00.000Z	bjrohan		Yep, that was it, I have ATI X1400, a page recommended I disable something in Compiz, I did, and poof things are gone
2011-11-04T06:27:00.000Z	bjrohan		will reboot
2011-11-04T06:27:00.000Z	bjrohan		ok
2011-11-04T06:27:00.000Z	bjrohan		thanks
2011-11-04T06:27:00.000Z	bjrohan		I am starting to believe that unity not so awesome
2011-11-04T06:27:00.000Z	Starminn	bjrohan	If you disable CCSM Unity will stop working
2011-11-04T06:28:00.000Z	Starminn	bjrohan	There is a CCSM plugin called "Unity Plugin" or some such that will kill Unity if you disable it, or CCSM (obviously) :)
2011-11-04T06:52:00.000Z	Starminn	bjrohan	:) Oh, don't be afraid of it. Just make sure not to disable Unity. Because, well, that disables Unity. :)
2011-11-04T06:41:00.000Z	Starminn	bjrohan	Try resetting CCSM to all system defaults, logout, then log into "Ubuntu" (as opposed to "Ubuntu 2D" like I assume you just did)]
2011-11-04T06:42:00.000Z	Starminn	bjrohan	Alternatively, if you can't get Unity to work at all, you can (other than a complete reinstall) just use GNOME Shell instead, much like many others in this room
2011-11-04T06:42:00.000Z	Starminn	bjrohan	Well, have you re-enabled all plugins that were acvtive to begin with? (Namely, the "Unity Plugin" or whatever)
2011-11-04T06:44:00.000Z	Starminn	bjrohan	That is your problem. If "Ubuntu Unity Plugin" is disabled, then, consequently, Unity itself will be disabled.
2011-11-04T06:44:00.000Z	Starminn	bjrohan	No. But if Ubuntu Unity Plugin is disabled, simply marking it on again should suffice. You turned it off when you unchecked it.
2011-11-04T06:46:00.000Z	Starminn	bjrohan	Well, let's see if this works first. ;)
2011-11-04T06:52:00.000Z	bjrohan	Starminn	That worked great, thanks again. I won't use CCSM for a while :-)
2011-11-04T06:53:00.000Z	Starminn	bjrohan	A suggestion to re-acclamate yourself to it -- go to the Unity Plugin (click on the name, not the box), and go to the Experimental tab. You can change icon size and transparency and stuff.
2011-11-04T06:53:00.000Z	Starminn	bjrohan	Don't be afraid of it -- just respect its power. ;)
