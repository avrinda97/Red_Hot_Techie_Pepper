2010-02-15T10:00:00.000Z	BHoward	socratesthekid	Wow its not showing up at all
2010-02-15T10:00:00.000Z	socratesthekid	BHoward	yeah.... thats my problem... I'm new here and have no idea what to do next
2010-02-15T10:01:00.000Z	BHoward	socratesthekid	oh what laptop model do you have?
2010-02-15T10:05:00.000Z	BHoward	socratesthekid	seems like most people just have trouble with the screen... Try booting into a live cd and see if your card is recognized
2010-02-15T10:07:00.000Z	socratesthekid	BHoward	I installed from a live cd.... it wasn't reading it then either
2010-02-15T10:09:00.000Z	BHoward	socratesthekid	try the directions on this page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/AR5007
2010-02-15T10:09:00.000Z	BHoward	socratesthekid	if this doesnt work i dont really know what else to try. Last time I had your problem my WIFI card actually went bad
2010-02-15T10:15:00.000Z	socratesthekid	BHoward	dumb question.... it's saying "install build essentails" in those directions.... i dont actually know what that means
2010-02-15T10:15:00.000Z	BHoward	socratesthekid	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2010-02-15T10:33:00.000Z	BHoward	socratesthekid	yeah whats up?
2010-02-15T10:34:00.000Z	BHoward	socratesthekid	which command?
2010-02-15T10:38:00.000Z	BHoward	socratesthekid	madwifi-unload is in the scrpits directory
2010-02-15T10:40:00.000Z	BHoward	socratesthekid	just continue following the guide i sent you. you will find the madwifi-unload ub rg scripts directory
2010-02-15T10:41:00.000Z	socratesthekid	BHoward	yeah, i went into the scripts directory and ran the next two commands... i guess they worked
2010-02-15T10:53:00.000Z	socratesthekid	BHoward	it doesnt seem to have worked
