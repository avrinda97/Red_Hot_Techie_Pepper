2010-05-23T19:52:00.000Z	utku		All colors in videos looks strange in Ubuntu 10.04: water is red, people's tan is blue...
2010-05-23T19:52:00.000Z	utku		How can I solve that?
2010-05-23T19:53:00.000Z	r2pashto	utku	perhaps your rose-colored glasses need tuning ;-)
2010-05-23T19:55:00.000Z	r2pashto	utku	what's your color depth in xorg.conf? ("grep Depth /etc/X11/xorg.conf")
2010-05-23T19:55:00.000Z	utku	r2pashto	24
2010-05-23T19:55:00.000Z	r2pashto	utku	(I'm just thinking perhaps your colormap is a little off due to depth)
2010-05-23T19:57:00.000Z	r2pashto	utku	huh, that should be fine. Using "xdpyinfo", does the section headed "supported pixmap formats:" include 32?

2010-05-23T20:01:00.000Z	r2pashto	utku	looking ...
2010-05-23T20:03:00.000Z	r2pashto	utku	looks good, and I'm quickly running out of immediate ideas; what kind of video card do you have? If nvidia, do you have nvidia-settings installed? Does it have any color modifications shown?
2010-05-23T20:04:00.000Z	utku	r2pashto	nvidia-settings is not installed, I'm installing it right now.
2010-05-23T20:04:00.000Z	utku	r2pashto	video previews in nautilus are fine by the way
2010-05-23T20:04:00.000Z	r2pashto	utku	heh ... of course, that would have made it "too easy"
2010-05-23T20:06:00.000Z	r2pashto	utku	if you have an nvidia, which driver are you using? (System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers) Sounds like you may be using "nv" (the free version) vice "nvidia" (the binary-only release)
2010-05-23T20:10:00.000Z	r2pashto	utku	if you're using "nv", try "nvidia" (if you're not against using binary-only drivers, that is)
2010-05-23T20:10:00.000Z	utku	r2pashto	ok
2010-05-23T20:12:00.000Z	utku	r2pashto	where can I change "nv" to "nvidia", I couldn't figure out
2010-05-23T20:15:00.000Z	r2pashto	utku	System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers. If it doesn't give you the option to activate the binary-only driver then you may need to "sudo apt-get install nvidia-current" (which *should* give you your dependencies)
2010-05-23T20:15:00.000Z	utku	r2pashto	oh, it is activated
2010-05-23T20:17:00.000Z	r2pashto	utku	okay ... huh ... I'm stumped, sorry
2010-05-23T20:20:00.000Z	utku	r2pashto	I'm gonna re-install :P
2010-05-23T20:21:00.000Z	r2pashto	utku	bummer, sorry man. I've done that too many times and know it's frustrating.
