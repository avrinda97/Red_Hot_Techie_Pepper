2005-12-25T08:45:00.000Z	tburdick		so geda isn't working... and no one seems to know why
2005-12-25T08:45:00.000Z	tburdick		I'm trying to compile it, but I get errors
2005-12-25T08:46:00.000Z	tburdick		g_basic.c:160: error: `scm_t_catch_body' undeclared (first use in this function)
2005-12-25T08:46:00.000Z	tburdick		it works fine in freebsd though?
2005-12-25T08:46:00.000Z	tburdick		why would that be
2005-12-25T08:47:00.000Z	bimberi	tburdick	there is an ubuntu package for geda - in the universe repository
2005-12-25T08:47:00.000Z	tburdick	bimberi	I just mentioned that doesn't work
2005-12-25T08:47:00.000Z	tburdick	bimberi	not only that, its like a year old
2005-12-25T08:48:00.000Z	tburdick		gschem segfaults
2005-12-25T08:48:00.000Z	tburdick		there's plenty of complaints about it in the forum and mailing list
2005-12-25T08:48:00.000Z	tburdick		no one has any answers though
2005-12-25T08:48:00.000Z	bimberi		sorry tburdick but i didn't see where you said that you were using the ubuntu packaged version
2005-12-25T08:48:00.000Z	tburdick		my mistake, I may have not said it clear enough
2005-12-25T08:49:00.000Z	tburdick		is there some metapackage for development tools and header files?
2005-12-25T08:49:00.000Z	tburdick		maybe I'm missing something that I don't know about
2005-12-25T08:49:00.000Z	bimberi	tburdick	build-essential
2005-12-25T08:49:00.000Z	tburdick		thank you
2005-12-25T08:50:00.000Z	tburdick		well whatever, I found some unstable debian packages
2005-12-25T08:50:00.000Z	tburdick		maybe it'll work out
2005-12-25T08:51:00.000Z	tburdick		well, what do you know... the debian unstable packages DO work :-D
2005-12-25T08:51:00.000Z	tburdick		someone should backport...
2005-12-25T08:51:00.000Z	bimberi	tburdick	great! yay for debian :)
