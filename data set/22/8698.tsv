2005-06-09T07:44:00.000Z	ethics	ShadowRage	why not just make the file readonly by pppd?
2005-06-09T07:45:00.000Z	ShadowRage	ethics	then I won't be able to get online
2005-06-09T07:45:00.000Z	ShadowRage	ethics	because of dynamic dns
2005-06-09T07:47:00.000Z	ethics	ShadowRage	sorry that doesnt make sense to me......dynamicdns....what do you mean by that?
2005-06-09T07:48:00.000Z	ShadowRage	ethics	the ISP dns servers are automatically put in via pppd
2005-06-09T07:49:00.000Z	ethics	ShadowRage	so what...if you put a realworld dns server...(can be ANY nameserver) in resolv.conf then its setup...pppd doesnt need to use its own dns  just a working dns.
2005-06-09T07:50:00.000Z	ShadowRage	ethics	....that doesn't have anything to do with what I'm asking
2005-06-09T07:50:00.000Z	ethics	ShadowRage	yes it does your not understanding what i mean i think
2005-06-09T07:50:00.000Z	ShadowRage	ethics	pppd places the ISP's dns servers in resolv.conf every time I dial up, so I can see websites and shit, obviously, however, it doesn't honor the settings I put in there beforehand.
2005-06-09T07:51:00.000Z	ShadowRage	ethics	also, it's cleared on every bootup as well
2005-06-09T07:52:00.000Z	ShadowRage	ethics	problem with that is, the dns servers occasionally change, and change with whatever number I use if I use a different access number if one is messing up
2005-06-09T07:52:00.000Z	ShadowRage	ethics	so that's a non solution
2005-06-09T07:53:00.000Z	ShadowRage	ethics	I'm thinking I need to md5sum the file like you have to do with xorg.conf for the OS to honor the changes
2005-06-09T07:58:00.000Z	ShadowRage	ethics	btw, it isnt just pppd
2005-06-09T07:58:00.000Z	ShadowRage	ethics	on bootup, it gets wiped
2005-06-09T07:58:00.000Z	ShadowRage	ethics	meaning, the system isnt honoring the changes
2005-06-09T07:58:00.000Z	ShadowRage	ethics	like it does with zorg
2005-06-09T07:59:00.000Z	ethics	ShadowRage	pppd runs on boot?  or any idea whats doing it at boot?
2005-06-09T08:00:00.000Z	ethics	ShadowRage	on boot i cant help you then...havent delved into xorg yet...
2005-06-09T08:02:00.000Z	ShadowRage	ethics	I had to do a md5sum of xorg.conf so the system wouldnt delete my settings
2005-06-09T08:02:00.000Z	ShadowRage	ethics	so there's a file monitor on or something
2005-06-09T08:03:00.000Z	ethics	ShadowRage	not that im aware of....there probably is but i dont know off the top of my head 8(
