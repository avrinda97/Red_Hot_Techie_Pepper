2007-06-07T14:49:00.000Z	jebuskrist		does anyone have a guide on installing the nvidia drivers in 7.04?
2007-06-07T14:51:00.000Z	jebuskrist		suggested no
2007-06-07T14:51:00.000Z	jebuskrist		but the more powerful the hardware the fancier stuff you can run
2007-06-07T14:52:00.000Z	jebuskrist		np
2007-06-07T14:53:00.000Z	jebuskrist		was linux designed by sadists?
2007-06-07T14:54:00.000Z	jebuskrist		try screaming ironfroggy :D
2007-06-07T14:54:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jebuskrist	i just might have to
2007-06-07T14:54:00.000Z	jebuskrist	ironfroggy	are you having an issue?
2007-06-07T14:56:00.000Z	jebuskrist	ironfroggy	thats rather strange
2007-06-07T14:56:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jebuskrist	i thought so too.
2007-06-07T14:57:00.000Z	jebuskrist	ironfroggy	is the fstab and grub install ok?
2007-06-07T14:57:00.000Z	jebuskrist	ironfroggy	when did this start?
2007-06-07T14:58:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jebuskrist	just last night. the system has been running fine for about six months since the last install, no problems whatsoever.
2007-06-07T14:59:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jebuskrist	not that im aware of and i dont think my wife even knows how to run the auto updates.
2007-06-07T15:00:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jebuskrist	grub is packed away safely on a floppy so it cant get messed up
2007-06-07T15:00:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jebuskrist	oh know im screwed! noob.
2007-06-07T15:01:00.000Z	jebuskrist	ironfroggy	check the grub install just to be sure that its pointing at the correct stuff :)
2007-06-07T15:02:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jebuskrist	yeah but thats exactly why i keep her boot loader on the floppy and out of reach of updates
2007-06-07T15:02:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jebuskrist	it has always worked better for me than booting from the drive.
2007-06-07T15:04:00.000Z	ironfroggy	jebuskrist	i can see that but the machine is only rebooted every few months, so its not like the disk is over tasked.
2007-06-07T15:04:00.000Z	jebuskrist	ironfroggy	i've had disks stored away for years and they come out semi-usable or totally unusable :(
