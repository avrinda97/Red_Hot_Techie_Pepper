2008-04-21T18:12:00.000Z	laughzilla		hm ... so i should specify the jumpers differently than CS ?  ok well there's 1 SATA drive (that's the new one) and there is 1 IDE (the old drive). what should i set the jumper to on the IDE drive? Master? Slave? i would guess Master since that's what it did by itself ?
2008-04-21T18:13:00.000Z	slowlearner	laughzilla	the disks have labels on them on how to set the jumpersa
2008-04-21T18:15:00.000Z	slowlearner	laughzilla	should prolly set the jumpers and use the right cable ends
2008-04-21T18:17:00.000Z	laughzilla	slowlearner	- the cable IS set, to CS.  and the cable ends are in properly. if it weren't, fdisk wouldn't see the disk, would it?    and fdisk does see the disk.
2008-04-21T18:17:00.000Z	slowlearner	laughzilla	lol, and what's the problem?
2008-04-21T18:18:00.000Z	laughzilla	slowlearner	the problem is that the mount command is not recognizing the partition i want to mount.
2008-04-21T18:18:00.000Z	slowlearner	laughzilla	and fdisk sees them?
2008-04-21T18:19:00.000Z	laughzilla	slowlearner	yes
2008-04-21T18:19:00.000Z	slowlearner	laughzilla	whats the error?
2008-04-21T18:19:00.000Z	laughzilla	slowlearner	it is this errror:   mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda1, missing codepage or helper program, or other error  In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try  dmesg | tail  or so
2008-04-21T18:20:00.000Z	slowlearner	laughzilla	what's fs type?
2008-04-21T18:20:00.000Z	laughzilla	slowlearner	it's Linux
2008-04-21T18:21:00.000Z	slowlearner	laughzilla	wow weird..
2008-04-21T18:21:00.000Z	laughzilla	slowlearner	yes
2008-04-21T18:21:00.000Z	slowlearner	laughzilla	you tried formatting the drive?
2008-04-21T18:21:00.000Z	laughzilla	slowlearner	i need to grab data off the drive before i do that.
2008-04-21T18:23:00.000Z	slowlearner	laughzilla	now thats a problem,
2008-04-21T18:23:00.000Z	laughzilla	slowlearner	- gee thanks, you get two points for being master of the obvious :D  if it wasn't a problem, i wouldn't be trying to solve it.
2008-04-21T18:24:00.000Z	slowlearner	laughzilla	sorry couldn't help..
2008-04-21T18:25:00.000Z	laughzilla	slowlearner	thanks all the same it is all appreciated :)
2008-04-21T18:25:00.000Z	slowlearner	laughzilla	well you can try a a linux recovery on windows
2008-04-21T18:26:00.000Z	laughzilla	slowlearner	actually i'm doing all of this just so i can wipe the disk and put windows on the old hdd (just to test it for something). so i can't try a linux recovery on windows atm.
