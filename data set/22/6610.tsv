2006-09-08T16:32:00.000Z	cerberus		I'm having trouble setting up a network between two ubuntu boxes. I've set up the netmask, adderss and network variables in /etc/network/interfaces on both machines but am still unable to ping either machine from the other. Does anyone know what else I need to do?
2006-09-08T16:33:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	first, try using a graphical tool instead of editing the interfaces file manually, you'll avoid syntax errors
2006-09-08T16:33:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	then, are you sure the two machines are plugged in the good ethernet plug? ;)
2006-09-08T16:33:00.000Z	cerberus	magnet	that's only an option on one machine, the other only has a server install
2006-09-08T16:33:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	finally, we can look a the conf :)
2006-09-08T16:34:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	paste your two files (and name the machines) on the pastebin and give the url
2006-09-08T16:36:00.000Z	cerberus	magnet	I've just pasted my config on the pastebin http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/22867
2006-09-08T16:37:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	1 sec, i'm looking at it
2006-09-08T16:37:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	how are the two machines connected (physically)?
2006-09-08T16:37:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	ok so direct connec, lemme check
2006-09-08T16:39:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	what's your other machine configuration
2006-09-08T16:39:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	(interfaces file)
2006-09-08T16:42:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	should work then, are you sure it's a crossover cable?
2006-09-08T16:42:00.000Z	cerberus	magnet	yes, I've sucessfully used it to link windows machines in past
2006-09-08T16:43:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	ok you didn't forget sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2006-09-08T16:44:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	that's weird :) it should work; are you sure your ethernet cards are supported and functional?
2006-09-08T16:46:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	no iptables firewall?
2006-09-08T16:47:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	check if you don't have to put an exception for your lan
2006-09-08T16:48:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	netsavy006 ok I know what to do for your prob, a sec :)
2006-09-08T16:53:00.000Z	cerberus	magnet	boy do I feel like an idiot now, I added an exception for the other box's IP but that didn't work, disableing the firewall however allowed the connection
2006-09-08T16:53:00.000Z	magnet	cerberus	hehe :) so problem solved, yeah
2006-09-08T05:05:00.000Z	cerberus	magnet	just incase you wanted to know, I've fixed up the firewall and now have everythnig working perfectly, thanks again for you help
