2007-03-06T16:21:00.000Z	juice`		hi, i have problems installing Ubuntu 6.06, 6.10 or the latest alpha 5. they all stall after i choose to install them, safe graphics mode doesnt help
2007-03-06T16:21:00.000Z	juice`		i can't even find any install logs on any consoles
2007-03-06T16:21:00.000Z	gyaresu	juice`	You probably need to pass a kernel boot option something like noacpi...
2007-03-06T16:22:00.000Z	gyaresu	juice`	If you hit ESC when you're at the first menu you should be able to add it to the kernel line in grub.
2007-03-06T16:23:00.000Z	gyaresu	juice`	Yeah ^^
2007-03-06T16:23:00.000Z	gyaresu	juice`	Ah. Old machine? Maybe try burning the iso at a lower speed. See if another livecd loads?
2007-03-06T16:24:00.000Z	gyaresu	juice`	acpi=off I thing.
2007-03-06T16:25:00.000Z	gyaresu	juice`	Jowi If you're loading the livecd then hit ESC at the first menu...
2007-03-06T16:30:00.000Z	gyaresu	juice`	Just happens with some install machines. Get it installed and update the kernel. Everything should be fine.
2007-03-06T16:30:00.000Z	juice`	gyaresu	yes, but when i tried to install alpha 5 which has 2.6.20 (newest kernel) it didnt help anyways
2007-03-06T16:30:00.000Z	juice`	gyaresu	i suspect it won't help, but i will try of course.
2007-03-06T16:31:00.000Z	gyaresu	juice`	There are ways and means. Maybe your chipset needs some extra module or something that isn't in the base kernel.
2007-03-06T16:32:00.000Z	juice`	gyaresu	oh ok, that makes sense. ok, thank you very much for help, going to play with kernel paramets after i read Documentation/ dir of course :)
2007-03-06T16:33:00.000Z	gyaresu	juice`	Can't hurt it to run that option. Just usually is that one IMHO.
2007-03-06T17:10:00.000Z	juice`	gyaresu	oh here you are :) i tried pci=noacpi and acpi=off and that didnt help :( i edited boot options while in the menu and pressing F6
2007-03-06T17:11:00.000Z	gyaresu	juice`	Cool. That's a learning experience for you. :) F6 is it? Didn't know that...
2007-03-06T17:12:00.000Z	juice`	gyaresu	yes, but that didnt help :(
2007-03-06T17:12:00.000Z	juice`	gyaresu	i found out though, that it can't load live cd that's why it's failing probably
2007-03-06T17:13:00.000Z	juice`	gyaresu	what to do now?
2007-03-06T17:14:00.000Z	gyaresu	juice`	New machine/ Won't start the livecd/ What to do next?
2007-03-06T17:17:00.000Z	juice`	gyaresu	i dont know?
2007-03-06T17:21:00.000Z	gyaresu	juice`	Sorry it's a troubling one. It's a new machine so I'm certain you need to pass some boot parameter to stop it choking.
