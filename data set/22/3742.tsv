2008-06-09T22:28:00.000Z	telmessos		hello. there's noone to help ?
2008-06-09T22:29:00.000Z	Rampage	telmessos	rightclick on the panel and add to panel (add whatever you want)
2008-06-09T22:30:00.000Z	telmessos	Rampage	there's no kopete on the list.
2008-06-09T22:30:00.000Z	Rampage	telmessos	if its a custom application then use the custom application launcher
2008-06-09T22:31:00.000Z	telmessos	Rampage	hmmm I found it but don't know where to find kopete. I am a beginner in the Gnome ;)
2008-06-09T22:32:00.000Z	Rampage	telmessos	use the desktop search function to locate the binary
2008-06-09T23:48:00.000Z	telmessos	Rampage	do you have any idea about my problem ?
2008-06-09T23:48:00.000Z	Rampage	telmessos	subtitles?
2008-06-09T23:48:00.000Z	Rampage	telmessos	what subtitles file are you using?
2008-06-09T23:49:00.000Z	Rampage	telmessos	i'm not sure, just started using linux myself. What i would have done in windows would be to embed the file with nandub or use media player classic
2008-06-09T23:50:00.000Z	Rampage	telmessos	i'm sure mencoder can do it somehow, but i don;t know unfortunately
2008-06-09T23:50:00.000Z	telmessos	Rampage	 thanks anyway
2008-06-09T23:50:00.000Z	Rampage	telmessos	sorry can't help more, these are things i need to learn

2008-06-09T23:52:00.000Z	Rampage	telmessos	doom9.com i think
2008-06-09T23:54:00.000Z	telmessos	Rampage	I found the solution mate. thank you. there's a subtitle encoding part in Preferences of M Player. In case anyone else asks
2008-06-09T23:54:00.000Z	Rampage	telmessos	send me a link please, will be useful to know
2008-06-09T23:55:00.000Z	telmessos	Rampage	language of the page is turkish. I'll search for the english version
2008-06-09T23:57:00.000Z	telmessos	Rampage	couldn't find. :( but it is very simple. Preferences > Subtitles & OSD > Encoding ;)
