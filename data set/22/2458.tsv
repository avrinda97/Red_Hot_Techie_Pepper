2009-06-21T21:59:00.000Z	crashanddie	edbian	Developers have no authority for what goes into the repos
2009-06-21T21:59:00.000Z	edbian	crashanddie	Then who does?
2009-06-21T22:01:00.000Z	crashanddie	edbian	Software packages uploaded to unstable are normally versions stable enough to be released by the original upstream developer, but with the added Debian-specific packaging and other modifications introduced by Debian developers. These additions may be new and untested. Software not ready yet for the unstable distribution is typically placed in the experimental repository.

2009-06-21T22:02:00.000Z	edbian	crashanddie	Yes but the ubuntu people are the ones who determine which branch a package goes into correct?
2009-06-21T22:03:00.000Z	crashanddie	edbian	not sure I understand the question
2009-06-21T22:04:00.000Z	edbian	crashanddie	I am not saying that the ubuntu developers write every single piece of software in the repos but they do pick and choose what goes into the different branches and what version of the software etc etc.
2009-06-21T22:04:00.000Z	crashanddie	edbian	no
2009-06-21T22:05:00.000Z	crashanddie	edbian	you are free to create a debian package and upload it to experimental/testing
2009-06-21T22:05:00.000Z	edbian	crashanddie	How then does a package get into main ?
2009-06-21T22:05:00.000Z	crashanddie	edbian	it will get upgraded to more mainstream repositories as time goes by and the package is voted clear
2009-06-21T22:05:00.000Z	edbian	crashanddie	Voted as clear by whom?
2009-06-21T22:05:00.000Z	crashanddie	edbian	community
2009-06-21T22:06:00.000Z	crashanddie	edbian	After a version of a software package has remained in unstable for a certain length of time (depending on the urgency of the software's changes), that package is automatically migrated to the testing distribution. The package's migration to testing occurs only if no serious (release-critical) bugs in the package are reported and if other software needed for package functionality qualifies for inclusion in testing.
2009-06-21T22:06:00.000Z	edbian	crashanddie	Just so you know this is much more of a learning experience than an argument for me :)
2009-06-21T22:06:00.000Z	crashanddie	edbian	no problem
2009-06-21T22:07:00.000Z	edbian	crashanddie	What do you think about danbhfive's opinion to not use the repos because of security issues / old software ??
2009-06-21T22:07:00.000Z	edbian	crashanddie	Thank you BTW :)
2009-06-21T22:14:00.000Z	crashanddie	edbian	it isn't
2009-06-21T22:14:00.000Z	crashanddie	edbian	the only point outbackwifi is trying to make: don't download from anything but official ubuntu repositories unless you know you can trust that repository
2009-06-21T22:33:00.000Z	crashanddie	edbian	happy learning!
