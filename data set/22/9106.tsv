2005-03-07T11:50:00.000Z	bborkk		I think I found an intermittent bug with Firefox that causes a system freeze.
2005-03-07T11:51:00.000Z	bborkk		The bug occurs when saving a webpage immediately after searching for and finding text.
2005-03-07T09:16:00.000Z	bborkk		I found a bug that causes a complete system freeze.  Involves Firefox.  Anyone want to try to replicate it?  I'm running Hoary on a Thinkpad laptop.
2005-03-07T09:16:00.000Z	Goshawk	bborkk	you can query me
2005-03-07T09:17:00.000Z	bborkk		Okay, open up Firefox, go to any webpage.
2005-03-07T09:17:00.000Z	Goshawk		done
2005-03-07T09:17:00.000Z	bborkk		Hit the '/' key to start a text search.
2005-03-07T09:18:00.000Z	bborkk		Type in some text to search for... make sure it is something on the page.
2005-03-07T09:18:00.000Z	Goshawk		and then?
2005-03-07T09:18:00.000Z	bborkk		While the text is highlighted and the search bar is still visible, hit Ctrl-s to save the webpage.
2005-03-07T09:19:00.000Z	bborkk		I have the latest Hoary version.
2005-03-07T09:19:00.000Z	Goshawk		done
2005-03-07T09:19:00.000Z	Goshawk		it is saved
2005-03-07T09:19:00.000Z	bborkk		Huh.
2005-03-07T09:19:00.000Z	Goshawk		no problems here
2005-03-07T09:19:00.000Z	bborkk		It seems sporadic, but more often than not completely freezes my machine.
2005-03-07T09:19:00.000Z	Goshawk		ubuntu web page saved correctly
2005-03-07T09:20:00.000Z	bborkk		Okay, let's all try the same webpage.  Load up slashdot.org.
2005-03-07T09:20:00.000Z	Goshawk	bborkk	btw, thanks i learned that with "/" i can open the search box quickly
2005-03-07T09:20:00.000Z	bborkk		Search for 'Mozilla' and save.
2005-03-07T09:20:00.000Z	bborkk	Goshawk	It's a good one.
2005-03-07T09:21:00.000Z	Goshawk	bborkk	done with slashdot... nothing
