2007-06-05T06:53:00.000Z	frank_		hi, i have a problem using totem + gstreamer (bad + ugly) plugins to play .wmv or .ram files
2007-06-05T06:54:00.000Z	frank_		when i open the file with totem it says i have to install the gstreamer plugin and shows me a synaptic-styled window, but it is already selected as "installed"
2007-06-05T06:54:00.000Z	frank_		i have "reinstalled", completely removed, new-installed the gstremer plugin... without any success
2007-06-05T06:54:00.000Z	frank_		can somebody please help me?
2007-06-05T06:54:00.000Z	varka	frank_	did you install w32codecs also?
2007-06-05T06:55:00.000Z	frank_	varka	yes, mplayer plays .rams but not .wmvs
2007-06-05T06:56:00.000Z	frank_	varka	should i use strece in order to examine the files opened by totem? maybe it tries to open the wrong path or something
2007-06-05T06:56:00.000Z	frank_	varka	this is the only option left... i simply have no idea why it doesn't work
2007-06-05T06:57:00.000Z	varka	frank_	mplayer makes no use of gstreamer plugins afaik. for totem you need them and for w32codecs you need the pitfdll plugin also
2007-06-05T06:57:00.000Z	frank_	varka	*strace*, sry
2007-06-05T06:57:00.000Z	frank_	varka	i can't find pidfdll in synaptic, do i have to install it manually?
2007-06-05T06:58:00.000Z	varka	frank_	gstreamer0.10-pitfdll
2007-06-05T06:58:00.000Z	frank_	varka	thanks, installed... i'm trying, one sec
2007-06-05T06:59:00.000Z	frank_	varka	it doesn't work: totem: search for suitable codec?
2007-06-05T06:59:00.000Z	varka	frank_	you have totem-gstreamer installed, not totem-xine?
2007-06-05T07:00:00.000Z	frank_	varka	one sec, checking
2007-06-05T07:00:00.000Z	varka	frank_	do you have that problem on a particular videofile or on all WMVs ?
2007-06-05T07:00:00.000Z	frank_	varka	i have totem-gstreamer installed, not totem-xine
2007-06-05T07:01:00.000Z	frank_	varka	on all wmvs (and rams on totem)
2007-06-05T07:01:00.000Z	frank_	varka	the ram files are playable with mplayer and they are 100% not drm'ed or something
2007-06-05T07:02:00.000Z	varka	frank_	strange, but i have no idea, sry
2007-06-05T07:02:00.000Z	frank_	varka	ok thanks anyway
