2010-12-15T06:55:00.000Z	histo	Guest31491	you could always download the install cd and try it out. You can live boot the cd and not install anything to your drive. If you like it then you can run the installer on the desktop
2010-12-15T06:55:00.000Z	histo	Guest31491	what secure bit?
2010-12-15T06:56:00.000Z	histo	Guest31491	what are you trying to do?
2010-12-15T06:56:00.000Z	histo	Guest31491	in ubuntu?
2010-12-15T06:57:00.000Z	histo	Guest31491	you need wine to run windows games in linux.  Install the package playonlinux it will be a big help
2010-12-15T06:57:00.000Z	histo	Guest31491	sudo apt-get install playonlinux
2010-12-15T06:57:00.000Z	histo	Guest31491	then you have it under applications > games > playonlinux
2010-12-15T06:58:00.000Z	histo	Guest31491	and walk throught hat to install
2010-12-15T06:58:00.000Z	histo	Guest31491	well using playonlinux is through wine. Most people find that easier.  If you wnat to do it just through wine you have to look at the appdb.winehq.org to get directions.
2010-12-15T07:02:00.000Z	histo	Guest31491	you either have to check appdb.winehq.org or ask the peeps in teh winehq channel
2010-12-15T07:02:00.000Z	histo	Guest31491	/j #winehq
2010-12-15T07:02:00.000Z	histo	Guest31491	there is also #playonlinux
