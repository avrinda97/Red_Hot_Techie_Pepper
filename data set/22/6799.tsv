2009-12-13T10:38:00.000Z	researcher1		how to uninstall a program?
2009-12-13T10:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	sudo apt-get remove programname or if you want to do config files as well  sudo apt-get purge programname
2009-12-13T10:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	ok well you can remove in synaptic,  or remove using the terminal with the command/s  I gave
2009-12-13T10:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	and synaptic can't be open when using those commands, or you will get an error message
2009-12-13T10:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	shoudn't do
2009-12-13T10:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	well if you remove samba for example, you woudn't be able to access   files on XP like that etc
2009-12-13T10:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	normalely if you remove a program from Ubuntu, it won't effect other programs
2009-12-13T10:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	well unless they are in the same group or whatever as in dependancies one needing the other etc
2009-12-13T10:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	oh and sometimes if removing programs it might want to remove ubuntu-desktop as well, but  that's ok to do,  it's just when your doing an upgrade to a later version of Ubuntu you might want that installed,  so you get all of the next one
2009-12-13T10:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	if I am correct about that second bit anyway
2009-12-13T10:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	Samba is for file sharing, and there's NFS and SCP and what not as well.  and then other programs for other types of networking
2009-12-13T10:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	you want to do what exactly?
2009-12-13T10:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	ah ha
2009-12-13T10:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	ok if it's over a LAN, you don't need to do it over SSH,  it's when using over the Internet VNC should be done over VNC to make secure
2009-12-13T10:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	done over VNC,  uhmm done over SSH when using over Internet
2009-12-13T10:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	a VNC client on Windows
2009-12-13T10:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	yes
2009-12-13T10:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	a VNC client/server or uhmm both for Windows one of them
2009-12-13T10:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	yes of course
2009-12-13T10:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	you connect to their computers etc
2009-12-13T10:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	there are a few vnc clients for Windows, looks like you should do a bit of research
2009-12-13T11:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	researcher1	well find out about the vnc clients and servers for WIndows that's a start
