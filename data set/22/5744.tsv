2007-03-08T07:01:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	why not try some other burning software.. brasseros or gnomebaker?
2007-03-08T07:02:00.000Z	Vaalth	Slart	: I'll give it a try. thanks :)
2007-03-08T07:13:00.000Z	Vaalth	Slart	: you know how i can install them?
2007-03-08T07:14:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	hmm.. hold on.. I'll check
2007-03-08T07:15:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	gnome baker is in the "Add/Remove Applications" thingy in the applications menu
2007-03-08T07:15:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	in accessories
2007-03-08T07:17:00.000Z	Vaalth	Slart	: i dont see it in there
2007-03-08T07:18:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	hmm.. were you on 6.06? or 6.10?
2007-03-08T07:18:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	ouch.. 5.04.. I wasn't even using linux back then.. =/..
2007-03-08T07:19:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	try "sudo apt-get install gnomebaker"
2007-03-08T07:20:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	now I'm beginning to understand why you were using cdrecord =)
2007-03-08T07:21:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	what is that version called? warty?
2007-03-08T07:23:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	there's some alternatives.. cdrtoaster is one
2007-03-08T07:24:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	I looked here http://packages.ubuntu.com/hoary/allpackages and searched for burn.. there are lots of cd burning packages.. there's bound to be one that works
2007-03-08T07:28:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	if it doesn't need any fancy libraries you usually can
2007-03-09T06:24:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	look in "man mount" there is a switch for file system.. set it to ntfs
2007-03-09T06:24:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	I don't mount my disks manually so I don't know the command.. but I can tell you what my fstab says?
2007-03-09T06:26:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	here it is /dev/sda1 /media/sda1     ntfs    defaults,noauto,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46     0       0
2007-03-09T06:27:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	first one is the device, second is the mount point, third is fstype, then there are some options... I don't think they are vital.. and then there's 0 0 for the autocheck.. and automount I think
2007-03-09T06:28:00.000Z	Slart	Vaalth	hope that helps you .. if not, just shout
