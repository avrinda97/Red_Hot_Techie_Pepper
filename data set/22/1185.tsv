2010-09-02T00:33:00.000Z	SOS		I wonder what jayne is upset about
2010-09-02T00:34:00.000Z	SOS		can someone tell me how to md5checksum my ubuntu cd with the windows version? jrib told me to do it like it was possible, but all I see this utility is capable of is files, not drives
2010-09-02T00:35:00.000Z	pfifo	SOS	boot from the CD and select the option to verify the contents
2010-09-02T00:36:00.000Z	pfifo	SOS	md5sum on a CDROM is not possible without a 3rd party tool
2010-09-02T00:38:00.000Z	pfifo	SOS	burn another copy, and use your recording to to verify burned contents after the session is done
2010-09-02T00:41:00.000Z	pfifo	SOS	you have an official copy?
2010-09-02T00:41:00.000Z	SOS	pfifo	yes
2010-09-02T00:41:00.000Z	pfifo	SOS	did jrib know this?
2010-09-02T00:41:00.000Z	SOS	pfifo	yes
2010-09-02T00:41:00.000Z	pfifo	SOS	is it scratched?
2010-09-02T00:41:00.000Z	SOS	pfifo	no
2010-09-02T00:42:00.000Z	pfifo	SOS	the likelihood of it being corrupted is slim. Can you boot from other CDs?
2010-09-02T00:42:00.000Z	SOS	pfifo	yes, and ubuntu does mostly boot. It just fails towards the end
2010-09-02T00:43:00.000Z	pfifo	SOS	what dose it do when it fails?
2010-09-02T00:43:00.000Z	pfifo	SOS	what version is that disk?
2010-09-02T00:43:00.000Z	SOS	pfifo	10.04
2010-09-02T00:44:00.000Z	pfifo	SOS	can you work on installing linux and chat on IRC on a different computer?
2010-09-02T00:45:00.000Z	SOS	pfifo	afraid not
2010-09-02T00:46:00.000Z	SOS	pfifo	It wasn't actually installing at the time. I was simply booting from the cd, and that gives me an installation error, I have no idea why
2010-09-02T00:48:00.000Z	pfifo	SOS	when you boot that CD, it first shows a menu that lets you choose things like "try ubuntu without change" and "Install Ubuntu" dose it not (i havent burned a livecd since 8.10 so im not 100% sure of this anymore)
2010-09-02T00:48:00.000Z	SOS	pfifo	I get no such option
2010-09-02T00:51:00.000Z	pfifo	SOS	after it shows the error message what happens then
