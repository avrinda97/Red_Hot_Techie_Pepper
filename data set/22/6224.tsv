2007-01-27T09:21:00.000Z	gop		hey how come
2007-01-27T09:21:00.000Z	gop		when I installed
2007-01-27T09:21:00.000Z	gop		eddgy
2007-01-27T09:21:00.000Z	gop		just installed eddgy
2007-01-27T09:21:00.000Z	gop		it has less packages
2007-01-27T09:21:00.000Z	gop		then
2007-01-27T09:21:00.000Z	gop		dapper
2007-01-27T09:21:00.000Z	gop		does eddgy have less packages
2007-01-27T09:21:00.000Z	riotkittie	gop	did you have multi and universe enabled on dapper? but not on edgy ?
2007-01-27T09:22:00.000Z	gop	riotkittie	 thanks I think   so
2007-01-27T09:22:00.000Z	gop	riotkittie	 can I enable them in eddgy
2007-01-27T09:23:00.000Z	riotkittie	gop	yea, you know how to do it right? enable the repos, that is?  oh, and as for the xchat, different how? you may be using xchat-gnome over xchat, or vise versa
2007-01-27T09:24:00.000Z	gop	riotkittie	 like  I don't even see user list the UI is different
2007-01-27T09:24:00.000Z	gop	riotkittie	 how do I enable the repos I forget
2007-01-27T09:26:00.000Z	riotkittie	gop	ok, if there's no user list, its xchat-gnome.    xchat is multi or uni, i think. as for enabling those, in a term, sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list  /etc/apt/sources.list.bak  and then open the /etc/apt/sources.list in the text editor of your choice
2007-01-27T09:27:00.000Z	gop	riotkittie	 oh so this is not the orginal xchat
2007-01-27T09:27:00.000Z	riotkittie	gop	and uncomment the lines thatt say multi and universe. or from synaptic, but i'm not sure which menu repos are on
2007-01-27T09:29:00.000Z	gop	riotkittie	 let me see
2007-01-27T09:30:00.000Z	gop	riotkittie	 I uncommented this
2007-01-27T09:32:00.000Z	gop	riotkittie	 do I need to do any thing special in eddgy to get mp3 and dvd support
2007-01-27T09:35:00.000Z	riotkittie	gop	you may need to poke around in sources again, looks like you just enabled the backport repos.
