2007-02-01T08:23:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	NaPsTeR	you could set up windows in vmware and do it like that...
2007-02-01T08:25:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	NaPsTeR	what vmware does is it installs windows or another os in a sandbox, but it can still talk to things like your cell phone
2007-02-01T08:26:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	NaPsTeR	or you could write your own drivers :)
2007-02-01T08:26:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	NaPsTeR	i dont think so, but you could try
2007-02-01T08:28:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	NaPsTeR	does it show up as a flash drive or anything when you plug it in?
2007-02-01T08:28:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	NaPsTeR	or better, does it have some sort of media slot?
2007-02-01T08:28:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	NaPsTeR	try dumping your music on it's memory card
