2010-01-26T00:09:00.000Z	Matson		I'm installing wordpress and **WAY** over the 5minute advertised install time
2010-01-26T00:09:00.000Z	Matson		following https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WordPress
2010-01-26T00:10:00.000Z	Matson		"If you will be using a virtual host, create your apache2 virtual host file in the /etc/apache2/sites-available folder." - where do I find the apache virtual hosts file?
2010-01-26T00:11:00.000Z	Matson		how do I start mysql?  there is no init file in init.s
2010-01-26T00:11:00.000Z	Matson		how do I start mysql?  there is no init file in *init.d*
2010-01-26T00:11:00.000Z	iceroot	Matson	/etc/init.d/mysql start  if it is installed with apt-get
2010-01-26T00:12:00.000Z	Matson	iceroot	it is installed, but /etc/init.d/mysql is not there
2010-01-26T00:12:00.000Z	iceroot	Matson	9.10? installed with apt-get?
2010-01-26T00:13:00.000Z	iceroot	Matson	mysql-server you want
2010-01-26T00:13:00.000Z	iceroot	Matson	sudo apt-get install mysql-server  and then  sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
2010-01-26T00:17:00.000Z	iceroot	Matson	it is usable
2010-01-26T00:18:00.000Z	iceroot	Matson	why? normally a user knows what he is doing
2010-01-26T00:18:00.000Z	iceroot	Matson	and if he dont know what to do, there are manpages
2010-01-26T00:20:00.000Z	iceroot	Matson	no because normally you dont want a second user
2010-01-26T00:20:00.000Z	Matson	iceroot	all your programs should access the mysql db with the root user?
2010-01-26T00:21:00.000Z	iceroot	Matson	and what should the script create? a second user without any rights? and if he should get some rights at setup, to what database? think about it
2010-01-26T00:21:00.000Z	Matson	iceroot	I have, walk the install user through creating a database, a user, and the rights for that user
2010-01-26T00:22:00.000Z	Matson	iceroot	that would seem more prudent than nothing
2010-01-26T00:22:00.000Z	iceroot	Matson	for that there is mysqladmin
2010-01-26T00:22:00.000Z	iceroot	Matson	no need for doing that at the setup
2010-06-01T22:25:00.000Z	iceroot	Matson	##hardware
2010-06-01T22:26:00.000Z	Matson	iceroot	thank you
