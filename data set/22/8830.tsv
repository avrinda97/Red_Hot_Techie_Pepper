2005-06-02T16:09:00.000Z	martin		i need fast help
2005-06-02T16:09:00.000Z	martin		i've installed a fresh system with smp kernel...but now usb doesn't work anymore....any suggestions?
2005-06-02T16:10:00.000Z	martin		p4 HT....i guess it is =), YES
2005-06-02T16:12:00.000Z	martin		hmpf
2005-06-02T16:12:00.000Z	martin		how to fix it
2005-06-02T16:12:00.000Z	anto9us	martin	HT is disabled in the latest security updates for smp kernel
2005-06-02T16:13:00.000Z	anto9us	martin	nope
2005-06-02T16:15:00.000Z	martin	anto9us	why is it disabled? and will it be enabled again?
2005-06-02T16:16:00.000Z	anto9us	martin	there's a security flaw, there's a thread on /. about it
2005-06-02T16:21:00.000Z	martin	anto9us	well, installing and booting the i686 kernel fixes it, but...just 1 cpu ;(
2005-06-02T16:22:00.000Z	martin	anto9us	btw: this there any real advantage of ht and smp under ubuntu?
2005-06-02T16:22:00.000Z	anto9us	martin	did you notice any/much performance improvement when you booted with smp?
2005-06-02T16:23:00.000Z	martin	anto9us	while booting? no, not really. but maybe there is a difference while working or gaming?!
2005-06-02T16:26:00.000Z	anto9us	martin	I would say the 686
2005-06-02T16:35:00.000Z	anto9us	martin	I have a usb card reader that I use regularly and a usb printer I used for the first time in months yesterday, they worked ok on the latest smp kernel
2005-06-02T16:35:00.000Z	martin	anto9us	so are mine not working with the smp kernel?
2005-06-02T16:36:00.000Z	anto9us	martin	I understood they stopped working when you upgraded to smp, did I get that right?
2005-06-02T16:36:00.000Z	martin	anto9us	right!
2005-06-02T16:37:00.000Z	anto9us	martin	go with the 686 kernel and see how you go :)
2005-06-02T16:38:00.000Z	martin	anto9us	thats a workaround but not a real solution ;)
2005-06-02T16:39:00.000Z	anto9us	martin	just like the disabling of HT in the smp kernel ;)
