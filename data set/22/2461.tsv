2011-12-27T22:32:00.000Z	edbian	sahed	do you see anything about this mouse in the output of dmesg?  It's big, if you want to pastebin it that'd be great: paste.ubuntu.com
2011-12-27T22:33:00.000Z	edbian	sahed	dmesg is a command you run in the terminal

2011-12-27T22:42:00.000Z	edbian	sahed	looks like it is being rapidly connected and disconnected over and over?
2011-12-27T22:42:00.000Z	edbian	sahed	with the message "port 4 disabled by hub?"
2011-12-27T22:43:00.000Z	sahed	edbian	 yep I tried too many time
2011-12-27T22:44:00.000Z	edbian	sahed	what USB hub is it talking about?
2011-12-27T22:45:00.000Z	sahed	edbian	 about connected and disconnected is for the old mouse that i had
2011-12-27T22:46:00.000Z	sahed	edbian	for the new one I don't know if really works
2011-12-27T22:46:00.000Z	edbian	sahed	hang on
2011-12-27T22:47:00.000Z	edbian	sahed	I'm not sure

2011-12-27T22:48:00.000Z	edbian	sahed	what?
2011-12-27T22:49:00.000Z	edbian	sahed	here's what you  need to do.  Turn the computer off, take the mouse out, boot the computer, log in, plug in the mouse, run dmesg, start googling the errors about the mouse you find in dmesg
2011-12-27T22:50:00.000Z	edbian	sahed	The biggest problem is that your dmesg right now has 100's of entries of you plugging and unplugging the mouse
2011-12-27T22:51:00.000Z	edbian	sahed	and apparently you have two different mouse's that you were doing this with
2011-12-27T22:52:00.000Z	sahed	edbian	 I'll do thanks for your time,
