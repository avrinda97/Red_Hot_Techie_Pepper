2008-05-08T13:56:00.000Z	zeno__	ikonia	it says there are broken deps, and i have no idea how to fix
2008-05-08T13:56:00.000Z	ikonia	zeno__	the word "broken" does not appear in that log
2008-05-08T13:56:00.000Z	ikonia	zeno__	there is no broken dependencies
2008-05-08T13:57:00.000Z	zeno__	ikonia	it says "dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of linux-restricted-modules-2.6.24-16-generic:"
2008-05-08T13:57:00.000Z	ikonia	zeno__	yes, but it's not broken

2008-05-08T14:01:00.000Z	ikonia	zeno__	what happens if you try to "sudo apt-get install linux-image-2.6.24-16-generic"

2008-05-08T14:04:00.000Z	zeno__	ikonia	i think the entire thing has to do with "Internal Error: Could not find image (/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.24-16-generic)", how would i go about fixin?
