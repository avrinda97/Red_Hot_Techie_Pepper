2007-06-22T10:53:00.000Z	afie		http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-338934.html    Ubuntu guys and girls, I am having the problem described in that link after updating alsa on this machine because an auto update broke the sound.
2007-06-22T10:54:00.000Z	afie		Now flash doesn't work and the person I recommended Ubuntu to (because I know windows would be an absolute fucking nightmare for them) asked me if computers "are supposed to have this many problems"
2007-06-22T10:54:00.000Z	afie		You're breaking my balls guys . . you are breaking, my balls
2007-06-22T10:55:00.000Z	afie		Names of available sound cards:
2007-06-22T10:55:00.000Z	afie		Intel
2007-06-22T10:55:00.000Z	afie		The card, works.
2007-06-22T10:56:00.000Z	afie		what doesn't work, is 32-bit flash with 64-bit firefox via nspluginwrapper.

2007-06-22T10:57:00.000Z	afie		That tells the story.
2007-06-22T10:57:00.000Z	jrib	afie	why would you use 64bit for a user who you don't think would be comfortable using windows?
2007-06-22T10:58:00.000Z	afie	jrib	who would expect "STABLE" Ubuntu updates to break ALSA drivers for a very very very widely used chip?
2007-06-22T10:58:00.000Z	jrib	afie	I'm referring to your flash comment
2007-06-22T10:59:00.000Z	afie	jrib	Because 32-bit flash used through nspluginwrapper is less broken than almost every aspect of windows.
2007-06-22T11:00:00.000Z	jrib	afie	but if you used 32bit ubuntu, you wouldn't need to bother with it at all
2007-06-22T11:00:00.000Z	afie	jrib	Which is still exponentially less troublesome than windows.
2007-06-22T11:00:00.000Z	jrib	afie	I am saying, you should install 32bit ubuntu instead of 64bit ubuntu for the user
2007-06-22T11:01:00.000Z	afie	jrib	No
2007-06-22T11:01:00.000Z	afie	jrib	I am saying Ubuntu updates shouldn't break ALSA on an extremely popular (intel hda) chip.
2007-06-22T11:02:00.000Z	jrib	afie	it might help if you include teh updates that broke alsa in your paste.  Did you check bugs.ubuntu.com?
2007-06-22T11:12:00.000Z	afie	jrib	I have alsa 1.0.14rc1 now.
2007-06-22T11:18:00.000Z	jrib	afie	what package specifically?
2007-06-22T11:18:00.000Z	afie	jrib	I've just found that emul-linux-x86-soundlibs-2.5 is compatible with the new ALSA.
