2010-09-01T16:04:00.000Z	jeepersz		how do I connect to the internet in ubuntu with dialup?
2010-09-01T16:05:00.000Z	jeepersz		how am I supposed to get the stuff to connect with a modem if I need the internet to get it? That's stupid
2010-09-01T16:07:00.000Z	jeepersz		ubuntu is pretty much worthless for anyone with dialup
2010-09-01T16:09:00.000Z	jeepersz		I can't download all the dumb stuff it says because I don't have an internet connection to do it
2010-09-01T16:10:00.000Z	jrib	jeepersz	how are you here now?
2010-09-01T16:10:00.000Z	jeepersz	jrib	windows
2010-09-01T16:10:00.000Z	jrib	jeepersz	that's fine, use that
2010-09-01T16:10:00.000Z	jeepersz		those programs don't work in windows
2010-09-01T16:10:00.000Z	jeepersz		I can't look at the website in ubuntu, either
2010-09-01T16:10:00.000Z	jrib	jeepersz	what programs?  Don't you just need some debs.
2010-09-01T16:11:00.000Z	jeepersz		It looks like i have to compile drivers
2010-09-01T16:11:00.000Z	jeepersz		and identify my modem
2010-09-01T16:11:00.000Z	jeepersz		and blah blah blah
2010-09-01T16:11:00.000Z	jrib	jeepersz	well that's what you need to do.  It's possible, just seems like you don't want to do it.  Which is fine, you don't have to
2010-09-01T16:12:00.000Z	jeepersz		I also didn't like the install. It was resizing my partitions before I even knew what it was up to. It could have said that was what I was agreeing to
2010-09-01T16:12:00.000Z	jrib	jeepersz	it doesn't resize partitions unless you tell it to
2010-09-01T16:13:00.000Z	jeepersz	jrib	I clicked on "install side by side" and the next thing I knew, it was resizing partitions and making new ones
2010-09-01T16:14:00.000Z	jeepersz		it's just retarded. I could use a real partition manager just fine, but it's dumbed down to the point of being obtuse
2010-09-01T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	jeepersz	I always thought the install was fairly explicit but if you think it should warn you more, file a bug
2010-09-01T16:15:00.000Z	jeepersz		and then grub wouldn't install. That failed. So now i have ubuntu on a partition I can't boot to, and if I do, dialup doesn't work
2010-09-01T16:15:00.000Z	jeepersz		yay, ubuntu!
2010-09-01T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	jeepersz	so what do you want help with now?  You seem to be going all over the p lace
