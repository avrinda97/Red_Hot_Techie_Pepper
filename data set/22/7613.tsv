2006-02-21T06:41:00.000Z	poningru	sismis	no just backup your data and do it, many steps can be taken to prevent data loss, such as defragment your windows as much as possible
2006-02-21T06:41:00.000Z	poningru	sismis	I did it and it was no big deal for me
2006-02-21T06:42:00.000Z	poningru	sismis	yeah the one included should be enough
2006-02-21T06:44:00.000Z	poningru	sismis	do those give better defragmentation results?
2006-02-21T06:44:00.000Z	poningru	sismis	I dont have much experience with win
2006-02-21T06:45:00.000Z	poningru	sismis	most definately backup and defrag
