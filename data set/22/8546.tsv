2005-08-07T14:01:00.000Z	Belutz		it would be nice if there is an icon for spreadubuntu.com so i cut put it in my blog :D
2005-08-07T14:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	Belutz	design some icons for Ubuntu!
2005-08-07T14:03:00.000Z	Belutz	Madpilot	that's the thing... i'm very not good at designing
2005-09-03T16:02:00.000Z	Belutz	Madpilot	how come if i use cp if it will overwrite the target, it didn't ask for confirmation?
2005-09-03T16:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	Belutz	"man cp" - there's probably a verbose option to get confirmations
2005-09-03T16:03:00.000Z	Belutz	Madpilot	ok thx :)
2005-09-03T16:04:00.000Z	Belutz	Madpilot	i think that's because you're an expert? :D
2005-09-03T16:05:00.000Z	Madpilot	Belutz	no, I just fake it, and I actually *read* documentation & man pages
2005-09-03T16:06:00.000Z	Belutz	Madpilot	why not make it reverse so linux know what i'm doing? :D
2005-09-05T14:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	Belutz	that's cool - let's hear it for oldschool browsers!
2005-09-05T14:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	Belutz	"Beernix"?
2005-09-05T14:43:00.000Z	Belutz	Madpilot	Beernix? there is?
2005-09-05T14:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	Belutz	don't think so, was just wondering what a beer-mug-logo'd distro might be called! ;)
2005-09-05T14:44:00.000Z	Belutz	Madpilot	ic ... hahaha... the "Beernix" sounds cool enough :D
2005-09-30T16:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	Belutz	point for you... ;)
2005-09-30T16:21:00.000Z	Belutz	Madpilot	thx :D
2006-11-02T13:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	Belutz	not every release is an LTS release
2006-11-02T13:10:00.000Z	Belutz	Madpilot	and why is that? i've been looking in the wiki and can't find the answer
2006-11-02T13:11:00.000Z	Madpilot	Belutz	LTS is for corporate enviroments & such, were they don't *want* to update everything every 6 months, and where 18months of support isn't long enough
2006-11-02T13:13:00.000Z	Belutz	Madpilot	one more questions, are the LTS versions would be release in every 2 years or how many months?
2006-11-02T13:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	Belutz	it sounds like every 3rd release is going to be LTS - possibly - so every 18 months
2006-11-02T13:14:00.000Z	Belutz	Madpilot	thanks a lot for your information :)
