2006-06-28T07:19:00.000Z	mmilo		hello
2006-06-28T07:20:00.000Z	mmilo		i was wondering if anyone could help out a noobie
2006-06-28T07:20:00.000Z	mmilo		:) ok i was wondering how I could set up the codecs I need to play avi files
2006-06-28T07:21:00.000Z	mmilo		I read the win32 howto and it didn't work for me
2006-06-28T07:21:00.000Z	mmilo		I'm using dapper, and I think the howto was written for breezy, not sure if that if that makes any difference
2006-06-28T07:21:00.000Z	jrib	mmilo	ubotu should have sent you a private message with the current howto's
2006-06-28T07:22:00.000Z	mmilo	jrib	not that I can see
2006-06-28T07:22:00.000Z	jrib	mmilo	see what ubotu just said
2006-06-28T07:23:00.000Z	mmilo	jrib	yep now I see it
2006-06-28T07:27:00.000Z	mmilo	jrib	how do i go about installing those files on the restricted list?
2006-06-28T07:27:00.000Z	jrib	mmilo	can you be more specific?  It varies depending on which particular files you mean
2006-06-28T07:28:00.000Z	mmilo	jrib	well there is a whole bunch, gstreamer, libxine
2006-06-28T07:30:00.000Z	mmilo	jrib	nevermind, i found them
2006-06-28T07:31:00.000Z	jrib	mmilo	what codecs does the file use? what player are you using?
2006-06-28T07:31:00.000Z	mmilo	jrib	ive tried both gxine and totem
2006-06-28T07:32:00.000Z	jrib	mmilo	and the codec it needs?  right click > properties > audio video tab, should say if you aren't sure
2006-06-28T07:32:00.000Z	mmilo	jrib	as for the codecs the files are using, they should be divx as far as i know
2006-06-28T07:32:00.000Z	mmilo	jrib	DivX MS-MPEG-4 Version 3
2006-06-28T07:35:00.000Z	mmilo	jrib	ok, new development, when i move the file over to my machine it plays fine, but I was trying to playing them remotely from a windows machine previously
2006-06-28T07:35:00.000Z	mmilo	jrib	is this something that can be resolved, using samba perhaps?
2006-06-28T07:35:00.000Z	jrib	mmilo	oh I see, not sure how to make that work
2006-06-30T16:35:00.000Z	jrib	mmilo	ctrl-alt-<arrow key> or you can set your own in system > preferences > keyboard shortcuts
