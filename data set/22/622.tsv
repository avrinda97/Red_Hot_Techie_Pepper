2011-11-01T08:41:00.000Z	flynn		OK, but I'm having trouble file sharing.  Do you think it could be just a bad install?
2011-11-01T08:41:00.000Z	x_	flynn	define file sharing
2011-11-01T08:42:00.000Z	flynn	x_	samba.  I can't mount shared windows folders.
2011-11-01T08:45:00.000Z	x_	flynn	got smbclient installed ?
2011-11-01T08:45:00.000Z	flynn	x_	I dont know.
2011-11-01T08:45:00.000Z	x_	flynn	sudo apt-get install smbclient smbfs
2011-11-01T08:47:00.000Z	x_	flynn	here is the official ubuntu guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountWindowsSharesPermanently
2011-11-01T08:47:00.000Z	flynn	x_	"already newest version"
2011-11-01T08:49:00.000Z	flynn	x_	I don't want to mount the shares permanently.
2011-11-01T08:50:00.000Z	x_	flynn	then can you just browse them through the file manager under network?
2011-11-01T08:51:00.000Z	flynn	x_	Nope
2011-11-01T08:51:00.000Z	x_	flynn	some problem on the windows side then i'd guess. folders not shared correctly some how.
2011-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	flynn	x_	they share fine if I use windows.  I'm trying to phase windows off my machine.
2011-11-01T08:54:00.000Z	x_	flynn	wait... are the shared folders your trying to access on a windows machine or ?
2011-11-01T08:57:00.000Z	x_	flynn	the SERVER (shared files) are on a windows machine, or the files are on a linux machine your answer is confusing me.
2011-11-01T08:59:00.000Z	flynn	x_	 I want access to files/folders on a windows machine.
2011-11-01T09:00:00.000Z	x_	flynn	smbclient -L ip-of-machine
2011-11-01T09:00:00.000Z	flynn	x_	ip of windows machine
2011-11-01T09:01:00.000Z	x_	flynn	i don't know what the ip of your machine is man.
2011-11-01T09:06:00.000Z	flynn	x_	oh, and it has shared docs in there too.
2011-11-01T09:09:00.000Z	x_	flynn	you will need to mount using the link I gave earlier using cifs.
2011-11-01T09:09:00.000Z	flynn	x_	ok
