2006-11-15T16:06:00.000Z	jordo23		Jucato: You there?
2006-11-15T16:08:00.000Z	jordo23		Anyone here run an AMD 64 distro?
2006-11-15T16:09:00.000Z	dennister	jordo23	i tried for months, and finally gave up
2006-11-15T16:09:00.000Z	jordo23	dennister	What did you do then?
2006-11-15T16:10:00.000Z	dennister		i'm now much, much appier with edgy on i386 platform
2006-11-15T16:10:00.000Z	dennister		things actually work
2006-11-15T16:10:00.000Z	jordo23	dennister	So you went back to another computer running a 32 bit chip...
2006-11-15T16:11:00.000Z	dennister		no, i'm still using my beautiful beast with my incredible hardware, but i386 os's only
2006-11-15T16:12:00.000Z	jordo23	dennister	did you find that there wasn't some common software and plugins for 64 bit architecture?
2006-11-15T16:12:00.000Z	dennister		the 64-bit hype is for the windoze crowd, and i'm trying to get away from windoze...yes, but drivers and stuff is still mising for 64-bit platforms
2006-11-15T16:13:00.000Z	jordo23	dennister	YEah!  I just installed Ubuntu x86_84 and there is no adobe flash plugin!
2006-11-15T16:13:00.000Z	dennister		the various distros have been trying to get 64-bit versions, but it's still months away
2006-11-15T16:13:00.000Z	dennister		sun-java's impossible on 64-bit stuff too
2006-11-15T16:14:00.000Z	jordo23		Dennister: Ubuntu has one though....I am pretty sure that's the version I installed.....
2006-11-15T16:14:00.000Z	jordo23		Dennister: yeah!  Java wouldn't install correctly the default way.....haven't tinkered with it though..
2006-11-15T16:14:00.000Z	dennister	jordo23	ok, and i installed it too...at first
2006-11-15T16:15:00.000Z	jordo23	dennister	yeah.....how far away are 64 bit versions of apps and stuff are we?
2006-11-15T16:15:00.000Z	jordo23	dennister	for linux
2006-11-15T16:15:00.000Z	dennister		but i couldn't get things like java to work...never got my tuner working at all...so in desperation i started listening to the pple who said to go the i386 route
2006-11-15T16:16:00.000Z	jordo23	dennister	yeah....I agree with you...
2006-11-15T16:16:00.000Z	dennister		i'm actually still a 3.5 month linux newbie...but my mythbox is almost completely done
2006-11-15T16:17:00.000Z	jordo23	dennister	thanks for the insight though....I though it was just me being stupid when trying to install this stuff.....but wanted to verify that a lot wasn't supported by the architecture...
