2008-06-24T23:37:00.000Z	mdave7		has anybody ever seen a whole load of errcode 530's and invalid user errors on boot? i'm coming up blank here.
2008-06-24T23:37:00.000Z	Agent_bob	mdave7	from ?
2008-06-24T23:38:00.000Z	mdave7	Agent_bob	pretty much everything that's starting up servers
2008-06-24T23:38:00.000Z	Agent_bob	mdave7	you didn't change the name of root did you ?
2008-06-24T23:38:00.000Z	mdave7		for example, when syslog's starting i get chown: invalid user: `syslog:adm'
2008-06-24T23:38:00.000Z	mdave7		nope. i agree it looks like i messed up the passwd file
2008-06-24T23:39:00.000Z	mdave7		this is after an upgrade running on a xen vps
2008-06-24T23:39:00.000Z	Agent_bob	mdave7	ok.  you don't have either the adm group or the syslog user account
2008-06-24T23:40:00.000Z	mdave7	Agent_bob	i'm just checking that now, but it looks like they're both there
2008-06-24T23:41:00.000Z	Agent_bob	mdave7	 grep adm /etc/group ;grep syslog /etc passwd   # will confirm that
2008-06-24T23:42:00.000Z	mdave7	Agent_bob	yeah, they're both there.
2008-06-24T23:42:00.000Z	mdave7		i'm having to manually check files since it wouldn't even throw me a prompt after boot
2008-06-24T23:42:00.000Z	Agent_bob	mdave7	 possable permissions issue on one of those files ?
2008-06-24T23:43:00.000Z	mdave7		passwd and group are both 644
2008-06-24T23:43:00.000Z	mdave7		this is on a xen vps after hardy upgrade, btw.
2008-06-24T23:44:00.000Z	Agent_bob	mdave7	hmmm and the first line of /etc/passwd is root:x:0:0.......?
2008-06-24T23:46:00.000Z	mdave7	Agent_bob	yup. sorry for the delay in the reply, hypervm is slow as hell.
2008-06-24T23:46:00.000Z	mdave7		root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash to be precise.
2008-06-24T23:47:00.000Z	Agent_bob	mdave7	ok.  you've stumped me dude.   maybe someone else can help you find it.
2008-06-24T23:48:00.000Z	mdave7		thanks anyway. i've googled this to death :-)
2008-06-24T23:48:00.000Z	Agent_bob	mdave7	if you ask in ##linux   someone might know
2008-06-24T23:48:00.000Z	mdave7	Agent_bob	okay, thanks.
