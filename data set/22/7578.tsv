2006-09-16T09:56:00.000Z	Healot		did you burn the image as file or as CD image?
2006-09-16T09:58:00.000Z	Healot		http://www.mp3licensing.com/ >> legal stuff here
2006-09-16T09:58:00.000Z	Healot		!find lame
2006-09-16T09:59:00.000Z	Tommck	Healot	- no dice then, right?
2006-09-16T09:59:00.000Z	Healot	Tommck	find it via; a) apt-cache search lame
2006-09-16T10:00:00.000Z	Tommck	Healot	- already looked
2006-09-16T10:00:00.000Z	Healot	Tommck	close the package manager!
2006-09-16T10:00:00.000Z	Tommck	Healot	- package manager?  I used apt-cache
2006-09-16T10:04:00.000Z	Healot	Tommck	btw thou package name is lame
2006-09-16T10:04:00.000Z	Tommck	Healot	- yeah... but apt-cache doesn't find it and I thought I had multiverse in my sources.lst
2006-09-16T10:06:00.000Z	Tommck	Healot	- what is supposed to be in my sources.lst for multiverse?
2006-09-16T10:10:00.000Z	Tommck	Healot	- thanks for the help
2006-09-16T10:11:00.000Z	Tommck	Healot	- I assumed multiverse was one of the "deb" lines I uncommented in sources.lst, but it's not in there by default... so I added it
2006-09-16T10:12:00.000Z	Healot	Tommck	you can put all the sections in one repos line though
2006-09-16T10:13:00.000Z	Tommck	Healot	- but... multiverse was in there before... same location...
2006-09-16T10:13:00.000Z	Tommck	Healot	- I added a separate line... and it worked fine
2006-09-16T10:13:00.000Z	Healot	Tommck	I prefer one liner; smaller file size
2006-09-16T10:13:00.000Z	Tommck	Healot	- but it didn't work with the one-liner
2006-09-16T10:14:00.000Z	Tommck	Healot	- I had the "backports" line uncommented... so "multiverse" was on there...   it could not find lame...
2006-09-16T10:14:00.000Z	Tommck	Healot	- then I added a separate line for the same server with just "multiverse"... and it could find it
2006-09-16T10:15:00.000Z	Tommck	Healot	- ahh... I'm an apt n00b... the first parm after the URL is some "repo"... then you tell it which branches (or some similar concept) to use under that?
2006-09-16T10:16:00.000Z	Tommck	Healot	- can that bot do a direct cranial download?  that'd be a lot faster
