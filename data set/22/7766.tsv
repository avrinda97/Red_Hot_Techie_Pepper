2006-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	rabbit		Whenever I boot my wireless doesn't work until I 'deactivate' and then 'activate' my wlan connection     (before I also had to do "iwconfig wlan0 mode managed"  but I put that in a startup script)
2006-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	Jeeves_moss	rabbit	 if you don't care about rebooting your card, then make a startup script.  VERY simple.  No sense making more work for your self.
2006-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	rabbit	Jeeves_moss	 how how how ? : )
2006-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	rabbit	Jeeves_moss	 why would I care about rebooting my card?   nothing bad with that is it?
2006-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	Jeeves_moss	rabbit	 unless you see smoke running out the side of your laptop, then don't worry about it.  My Toshiba Sta 20 does that.  its a pain in the ass.  Once the system boots, it "flashes" the power to the card.  Then you have to either physicaly turn it off and on again, or just tell the OS to reboot it.  One thing you might do if the actual hardware is resetting it see if you can configure the card as a hotplugable card so the OS wil
2006-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	rabbit	Jeeves_moss	 watchdog?
2006-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	Jeeves_moss	rabbit	 yes, the OS will poll the card every once and a while to see if its still attached, and if it sees that its re-attached, it reinstalls it into the system.  No need to keep rebooting the card in the OS
2006-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	rabbit	Jeeves_moss	   so are hotpluggable and watchdog 2 different things?
2006-01-01T11:40:00.000Z	rabbit	Jeeves_moss	 k
2006-01-01T11:52:00.000Z	rabbit	Jeeves_moss	  I think my card is hotpluggable, take a look at my /etc/network/interfaces   http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6226
2006-01-01T11:53:00.000Z	Jeeves_moss	rabbit	 I'll look @ it in a sec.  one thing you can do it create multi profiles for it so all you'd have to do is type ifconfig up <card profile> and it'll read the part of the file that has the right configuration for your card
2006-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	Jeeves_moss	rabbit	 that link is a basic "interfaces" set up file.  mine has 2 differen't settings for both my wired and woreless cards.  when I'm out, I just type in "ifconfig up away" and it configures my cards to be DHCPed, and when I'm @ home, I type in "ifconfig up home", and it auto configures my cards with the corect static IPs for my networks.
2006-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	rabbit	Jeeves_moss	 would you mind showing me your file ?   or take out sensitive stuff?
2006-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	Jeeves_moss	rabbit	 my laptop is dead.  I cooked the CPU in an overclocking experment.  I'm currently getting it fixed.  I should go though.  my fiance is ready for bed.
2006-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	rabbit	Jeeves_moss	 before you go..
2006-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	rabbit	Jeeves_moss	 there's an example on this page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WiFiHowto
2006-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	Jeeves_moss	rabbit	 make it quick.  I can't keep my woman waiting.
2006-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	rabbit	Jeeves_moss	 under  " Adding it to /etc/network/interfaces "
2006-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	rabbit	Jeeves_moss	  like that?  except I don't need that script eh?
2006-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	rabbit	Jeeves_moss	 : S
2006-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	rabbit	Jeeves_moss	 yeah thanks
2006-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	rabbit	Jeeves_moss	  have fun, ha
