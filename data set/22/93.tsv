2012-10-16T15:53:00.000Z	rsser		how can I run the non bash script?
2012-10-16T15:54:00.000Z	rsser		the script is #!/bin/bash
2012-10-16T15:54:00.000Z	rsser		the system says: /bin/bash^M: invalid compiler: file or directory missing
2012-10-16T15:55:00.000Z	Gnea	rsser	#!/bin/sh
2012-10-16T15:56:00.000Z	rsser	Gnea	why is that happened?
2012-10-16T15:56:00.000Z	Gnea	rsser	dos2unix should fix it too
2012-10-16T15:56:00.000Z	Gnea	rsser	because someone wrote the script in notepad, probably
2012-10-16T15:57:00.000Z	Gnea	rsser	yes, but there are systems like cygwin that allow you to run shell scripts in windows
2012-10-16T15:59:00.000Z	Gnea	rsser	no, just install dos2unix and run the script through it - that'll fix it
2012-10-16T16:00:00.000Z	rsser	Gnea	could you see the script?
2012-10-16T16:00:00.000Z	Gnea	rsser	huh?
2012-10-16T16:00:00.000Z	rsser	Gnea	look that ==> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7570113/linux-kernel-3.6.1
2012-10-16T16:01:00.000Z	Gnea	rsser	iacon% file linux-kernel-3.6.1.txt
2012-10-16T16:02:00.000Z	Gnea	rsser	"with CRLF line terminators"  <-- that.
2012-10-16T16:04:00.000Z	Gnea	rsser	so just dos2unix linux-kernel-3.6.1.txt
2012-10-16T16:06:00.000Z	Gnea	rsser	I've always found that using the real hardware is better to test with in a non-professional setting
2012-10-16T16:06:00.000Z	rsser	Gnea	good point
2012-10-16T16:07:00.000Z	rsser	Gnea	everyone knows about that, why does the problem persist?
2012-10-16T16:08:00.000Z	Gnea	rsser	well, you just did
2012-10-16T16:08:00.000Z	Gnea	rsser	not really, it's more of a nuissance than anything else, but there's nothing specifically against such distribution.
2012-10-16T16:09:00.000Z	Gnea	rsser	because they're inefficient and they're m$-specific? can't think of why else...
2012-10-16T16:11:00.000Z	rsser	Gnea	but wouldn't the right the carry jump to the next line and move to left?
