2010-03-06T15:34:00.000Z	Roffe		Hello! I recenly Installed Ubuntu and had some Display issues, How do I know if the driver is actually Installed?
2010-03-06T15:34:00.000Z	Roffe		I have ATI Card
2010-03-06T15:35:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Roffe	usually hardware drivers will show you if you're using a proprietary driver or not
2010-03-06T15:35:00.000Z	Roffe	psycho_oreos	yeah but it does not show anything there
2010-03-06T15:36:00.000Z	Roffe	psycho_oreos	does this mean there aint no proprietary drive available?
2010-03-06T15:36:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Roffe	possibly yes, meaning you're probably going to be stuck with the radeon driver
2010-03-06T15:37:00.000Z	Roffe	psycho_oreos	yeah... maybe I was dumb installing 8.04
2010-03-06T15:38:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Roffe	sometimes the free driver works better or supports older cards better than the proprietary one, this case is very true for ati chipsets
2010-03-06T15:39:00.000Z	Roffe	psycho_oreos	yeah... It was weird that I had to change some things in xorg to actually get the display to work
2010-03-06T15:40:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Roffe	you might face similar issues if you use updated version, it all depends on your chipset.. considering you have edited xorg, are you using radeon? if so that may be the only choice available with latter versions of ubuntu on that same box
2010-03-06T15:41:00.000Z	Roffe	psycho_oreos	well the thing is that this is actually Kubuntu but no one answered me in that channel I just thought that it's quite the same
2010-03-06T15:42:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Roffe	heh only difference between ubuntu, kubuntu, xubuntu and soon lubuntu is just a matter of different frontends.. they all share the same base more or less
2010-03-06T15:42:00.000Z	Roffe	psycho_oreos	I've tried ubuntu 9.10 on this computer and it worked great, however I like the old KDE more than Gnome but I hate the new KDE
2010-03-06T15:44:00.000Z	Roffe	psycho_oreos	is there anyway I could install Kubuntu 9.10 and still have the KDE from 8.04?
2010-03-06T15:44:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Roffe	not really I'm afraid, it might work vice-versa but not easily
2010-03-06T15:45:00.000Z	Roffe	psycho_oreos	ok thx.... that's a shame because imo KDE has gotten alot worse over the years
2010-03-06T15:45:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Roffe	you might want to give lxde a try, in some ways it looks a little similar to kde3.5
2010-03-06T15:47:00.000Z	Roffe	psycho_oreos	wow :D... thank you for recommending that :) I will try it Kubuntu 8.04 keeps crashing on me
2010-03-06T15:48:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Roffe	lxde? np
2010-03-06T15:48:00.000Z	Roffe	psycho_oreos	yes :D
2010-03-06T15:50:00.000Z	Roffe	psycho_oreos	thank you for your help
2010-03-06T15:50:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Roffe	np
