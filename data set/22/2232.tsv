2010-02-19T15:19:00.000Z	GABBAR		hey guys, i just installed karmic my wireless is working great on gnome, but i just installed e17, wireless doesn't seem to work any ideas ?
2010-02-19T15:20:00.000Z	alankila	GABBAR	e17 doesn't start network manager applet would be my guess, so you don't get a connection.
2010-02-19T15:20:00.000Z	GABBAR	alankila	k lemme try starting it
2010-02-19T15:21:00.000Z	GABBAR	alankila	ermm how i start the network manager applet manualy ?
2010-02-19T15:22:00.000Z	alankila	GABBAR	I just hinted at the answer: not worth finding out. Just use GNOME :)
2010-02-19T15:22:00.000Z	GABBAR	alankila	i wanna use e17,
2010-02-19T15:22:00.000Z	alankila	GABBAR	but if you are adventurous, try "nm-applet" from command line. It either starts or fails.
2010-02-19T15:23:00.000Z	alankila	GABBAR	or maybe it's called network-manager-applet or Network-Manager-applet. I'm not quite sure what they call that little thing.
2010-02-19T15:23:00.000Z	GABBAR		nm-applet it is
2010-02-19T15:23:00.000Z	GABBAR	alankila	well i guess its running, but since i can't see it anywhere hehehe
2010-02-19T15:23:00.000Z	alankila	GABBAR	if it starts, then good. You can probably force it to start somehow at beginning of session. If it doesn't work, you're probably out of luck with respect to that.
2010-02-19T15:24:00.000Z	alankila	GABBAR	and I state again: don't use e17. It's stupid.
2010-02-19T15:24:00.000Z	alankila		Not supported. Nonsense. Just wastes time.
2010-02-19T15:24:00.000Z	GABBAR	alankila	hmm
2010-02-19T15:24:00.000Z	GABBAR	alankila	ok, can ya help me on a related topic ?/
2010-02-19T15:24:00.000Z	GABBAR	alankila	if i don't wanna use nm=applet for using my wireless on gnome, what are the alternatives ?
2010-02-19T15:25:00.000Z	alankila		By the way, is e17 the enlightenment version they've been working on for at least 5 years? Or is it more now?
2010-02-19T15:25:00.000Z	GABBAR	alankila	i tried wicd on gnome, it detected by wireless, but never connected, it authenticated etc. but always got stuck on the getting ip address part
2010-02-19T15:25:00.000Z	GABBAR	alankila	hehe no idea
2010-02-19T15:25:00.000Z	alankila	GABBAR	wicd, or somehow configure nm-applet to start the connection even when the applet isn't running. It's possible somehow, but I don't know the tools too well
2010-02-19T15:26:00.000Z	GABBAR	alankila	i tried wicd on gnome, it detected by wireless, but never connected, it authenticated etc. but always got stuck on the getting ip address part
2010-02-19T15:26:00.000Z	alankila	GABBAR	well, tells all about how well linux stuff works. There's generally only one thing that works (which is what everyone else is doing). Step outside that, and you're mostly on your own.
