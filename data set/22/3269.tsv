2012-02-14T02:14:00.000Z	Simon1245		Hey guys, I got a question, I need a x64 but I accidently downloaded the x32
2012-02-14T02:15:00.000Z	Simon1245		Is there any way to update it to x64 instead without having to reinstall it all?
2012-02-14T02:15:00.000Z	mbeierl	Simon1245	there is no upgrade that I have ever come across, sorry
2012-02-14T02:15:00.000Z	mbeierl	Simon1245	however, if you keep your /home, then after the re-install your data will still be there
2012-02-14T02:17:00.000Z	mbeierl	Simon1245	also the 4gb limit.  above 4gb (technically 3.2?) you will need to use PAE for addressing the larger area of memory
2012-02-14T02:17:00.000Z	Simon1245	mbeierl	so if I have 4gb it's fine?
2012-02-14T02:18:00.000Z	Simon1245	mbeierl	It feels that ubuntu is really slow though, Windows loads much faster and shit so I thought wrong version might be the prblem
2012-02-14T02:18:00.000Z	mbeierl	Simon1245	I would almost recommend 32bit over 64 with less than 4gb as the larger addressing space causes you to have less usable memory.  (reference needed)
2012-02-14T02:19:00.000Z	Simon1245	mbeierl	I got 4gb ram on this laptop so wouldn't it be better to switch it?
2012-02-14T02:19:00.000Z	mbeierl	Simon1245	define slow.  Anything in particular?
2012-02-14T02:19:00.000Z	Simon1245	mbeierl	Like loading everything a firefox app takes like 2-4 seconds and this one is completly clean
2012-02-14T02:20:00.000Z	mbeierl	Simon1245	what about subsequent loads?  It might just be that your disk cache is cold
2012-02-14T02:22:00.000Z	Simon1245	mbeierl	didn't get what you meant, sorry mind explaining your question, please?
2012-02-14T02:34:00.000Z	mbeierl	Simon1245	sorry - what I was saying about firefox being slow to load is that the first invocation of a program causes it to be loaded off the disk.  Secondary ivocations of commonly used programs have the advantage of being able to use data that is still in the cache.
2012-02-14T02:35:00.000Z	mbeierl	Simon1245	but someone else afterwards did say that firefox is slower under Linux, so it's not a fair comparison
2012-02-14T02:37:00.000Z	Simon1245	mbeierl	oh
2012-02-14T02:37:00.000Z	Simon1245	mbeierl	I'll try chrominues ors omething liek that to see how it works :)
2012-02-14T02:38:00.000Z	mbeierl	Simon1245	I'm a die-hard firefox user, so... You can try, but I find once loaded, ff is as quick...
2012-02-14T02:39:00.000Z	Simon1245	mbeierl	by the way can it be something to do with my computer not meeting the requierments?
2012-02-14T02:40:00.000Z	mbeierl	Simon1245	bah.  Nearly any computer can meet linux requirements.  Just depends on what gadgets/bells/eye-candy, etc you choose to go along with it :)
2012-02-14T02:41:00.000Z	Simon1245	mbeierl	I mean this one with untiy thing, maybe that's the main reason it causes lag?
2012-02-14T02:43:00.000Z	mbeierl	Simon1245	yes.  That is entirely possible.  Microsoft did spend some time with (I think) Vista, to allow basic vs. eye-candy, and I think it chooses for you.  With Unity, you almost need to try and decide to go 2d explicitly if it does not suit your needs
