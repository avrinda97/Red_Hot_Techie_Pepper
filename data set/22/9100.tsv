2005-05-25T11:09:00.000Z	lotusleaf	Shufla	in your opinion how is it dangerous?
2005-05-25T11:10:00.000Z	Shufla	lotusleaf	my english skills aren't good enough to explain it.
2005-05-25T11:10:00.000Z	Shufla	lotusleaf	1. i'm analyzing with my geeky friends the problem sudo or su.
2005-05-25T11:10:00.000Z	lotusleaf	Shufla	I see...
2005-05-25T11:11:00.000Z	Shufla	lotusleaf	2. with ubuntu, if it's provided without root password, i won't setup root password (not needed, i want to be "supported", so if i'm supporting someone -- look at docs, all with sudo)
2005-05-25T11:12:00.000Z	Shufla	lotusleaf	3. one less password to remeber, you are able to twaek /etc/sudoers to raise security level. one password less - so one can be better.
2005-05-25T11:13:00.000Z	Shufla	lotusleaf	enough? :D
2005-05-25T11:13:00.000Z	Shufla	lotusleaf	right now most important for me is that supporting is eaiser with similar systems.
2005-05-25T11:14:00.000Z	lotusleaf	Shufla	yes thanks ;)
