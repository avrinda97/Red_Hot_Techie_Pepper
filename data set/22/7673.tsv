2006-01-28T13:30:00.000Z	noaXess		somebody any idea? where is the default linux-source path?
2006-01-28T13:31:00.000Z	slavik	noaXess	have you tried the wiki? the answer might be there
2006-01-28T13:31:00.000Z	noaXess	slavik	wiki on ubuntu.com.. no not yet
2006-01-28T13:34:00.000Z	noaXess	slavik	is it normal.. that install linux.source over synaptic only download the source.. not extract it?
2006-01-28T13:35:00.000Z	slavik	noaXess	I would expect the extraction unless you told it to download only
2006-01-28T13:37:00.000Z	noaXess	slavik	normaly i do not activate the option to download only.. hm...
2006-01-28T13:37:00.000Z	slavik	noaXess	then it could be that the package says to download the stuff only ...
2006-01-28T13:41:00.000Z	noaXess	slavik	synaptic download the linux-source .deb file and extract the .tar.bz2 file into /usr/src...
2006-01-28T13:42:00.000Z	slavik	noaXess	is that dir fine with you?
2006-01-28T13:42:00.000Z	noaXess	slavik	i think so.. i think i need extract it myself..
2006-01-28T13:43:00.000Z	noaXess	slavik	like explained in wiki :)
2006-01-28T13:43:00.000Z	slavik	noaXess	you can always do that ^^
2006-01-28T13:43:00.000Z	slavik	noaXess	can you give me the link to the wiki page?
2006-01-28T13:55:00.000Z	slavik	noaXess	I don't see a reason why it wouldn't be allowed to install
2006-01-28T13:55:00.000Z	noaXess	slavik	i to.. it says there is no version.h in the /usr/src/linux files..
2006-01-28T13:56:00.000Z	noaXess	slavik	i have extracted /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.12.tar.bz2
2006-01-28T13:56:00.000Z	slavik	noaXess	hmm ... try to search for that file
2006-01-28T13:56:00.000Z	noaXess	slavik	for what file?
2006-01-28T14:01:00.000Z	noaXess	slavik	version.h should be in /user/src/linux/.. see error..
2006-01-28T14:01:00.000Z	noaXess	slavik	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/7541
2006-01-28T14:27:00.000Z	noaXess	slavik	it is linux-headers .. then all is in /usr/src.. :)
2006-01-28T14:27:00.000Z	noaXess	slavik	and now my vmware workstation runs.. :)
