2008-08-03T17:58:00.000Z	Shadda-		*sigh* why does it have to be an impossible task to setup a graphics card
2008-08-03T17:58:00.000Z	Shadda-		it's not as if this is an obscure card
2008-08-03T17:58:00.000Z	Shadda-		nvidia 7800gt
2008-08-03T17:58:00.000Z	Shadda-		apparently not
2008-08-03T17:59:00.000Z	Shadda-		as I continually get the low graphics prompt
2008-08-03T17:59:00.000Z	Shadda-		every freaking time
2008-08-03T18:00:00.000Z	Shadda-		I enabled the driver. I got low graphics prompt.
2008-08-03T18:00:00.000Z	Shadda-		I configure, and go back in and the driver isn't enabled anymore.
2008-08-03T18:00:00.000Z	tim	Shadda-	don't use the configure dialog
2008-08-03T18:00:00.000Z	tim	Shadda-	you know your way around the console at all?
2008-08-03T18:01:00.000Z	tim	Shadda-	boot into recovery mode, drop into the console, delete your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file, sudo apt-get install nvidia-xconfig
2008-08-03T18:01:00.000Z	tim	Shadda-	then run nvidia-xconfig, reboot, and it should be working
2008-08-03T18:02:00.000Z	tim	Shadda-	(backing up your xorg.conf file if you feel it necessary, but it doesn't sound like you've done anything special with it
2008-08-03T18:06:00.000Z	Shadda-	tim	Did that, restarted, it tries to start x, blinks a few times
2008-08-03T18:06:00.000Z	tim	Shadda-	pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.log.0 file
2008-08-03T18:11:00.000Z	tim	Shadda-	still there?
2008-08-03T18:12:00.000Z	Shadda-	tim	gotta setup the network to pastebin heh
2008-08-03T18:12:00.000Z	tim	Shadda-	(apt-get install pastebinit, then you can just cat /var/log/Xorg.log.0 | pastebinit)
2008-08-03T18:16:00.000Z	tim	Shadda-	on brother's site, go to any particular printer, they have a linux section for pretty much all of them
2008-08-03T18:16:00.000Z	tim	Shadda-	^^^
2008-08-03T18:17:00.000Z	tim	Shadda-	sorry :p
