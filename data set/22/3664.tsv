2009-01-16T20:13:00.000Z	KenBW2		what's "gamma" wrt graphics?
2009-01-16T20:13:00.000Z	Slart	KenBW2	it's a value that says something about how bright stuff is
2009-01-16T20:13:00.000Z	KenBW2	Slart	as opposed to, er, brightness?
2009-01-16T20:13:00.000Z	Slart	KenBW2	higer value means brighter things
2009-01-16T20:13:00.000Z	Slart	KenBW2	brightness also has to do with.. ahem.. brightness.. but it's a different thing
2009-01-16T20:14:00.000Z	KenBW2	Slart	is brightness a way of adding more white, whereas gamma is brightening the actual colours??
2009-01-16T20:14:00.000Z	Slart	KenBW2	read here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction
2009-01-16T20:15:00.000Z	KenBW2	Slart	d'oh, shouldve thought of looking there :) thanks
2009-01-16T20:15:00.000Z	Slart	KenBW2	you're welcome
2009-01-16T20:16:00.000Z	Slart	KenBW2	it seems, after reading that page, that it is a value describing contrast not brightness.. I'll go sit in the corner with the pointy hat until I've read it =)
2009-01-16T20:19:00.000Z	KenBW2	Slart	teehee
2009-01-16T20:20:00.000Z	KenBW2	Slart	im trying to make darker pages less dark without making colours look washed out
2009-01-16T20:20:00.000Z	Slart	KenBW2	in Gimp?
2009-01-16T20:21:00.000Z	KenBW2	Slart	in everything - it's my monitor with the problem :)
2009-01-16T20:22:00.000Z	Slart	KenBW2	ah.. well.. can't really help you with that..sorry
2009-01-16T20:22:00.000Z	KenBW2	Slart	you already have

2009-02-26T02:56:00.000Z	Slart	KenBW2	at least that what it says in the menu
2009-02-26T02:56:00.000Z	KenBW2	Slart	i mean one i can add to a launcher
2009-02-26T02:58:00.000Z	Slart	KenBW2	there seems to be a -b switch for adding batch commands.. sounds useful
2009-02-26T03:03:00.000Z	KenBW2	Slart	seems to be a bit more powerful than what i want
