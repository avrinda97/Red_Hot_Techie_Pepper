2007-06-06T08:46:00.000Z	fragger56		I seem to have broken xorg on my laptop install, the most recent thing ive done or changed was trying to get my swap to work. I have already tried to do the reconfigure xorg trick via the recovery mode
2007-06-06T08:48:00.000Z	fragger56		is there a way to fix my ubuntu setup/xorg problem short of a reinstall?
2007-06-06T08:48:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	what kind of error messages are you getting?
2007-06-06T08:49:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	and what did you say the most recent major changes you've made are?
2007-06-06T08:52:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	when you're doing a "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg", select "vesa" as the driver
2007-06-06T08:56:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	ahh
2007-06-06T08:58:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	how are your drives setup
2007-06-06T08:58:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	which file do you need to edit?
2007-06-06T09:00:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	I know which that is.
2007-06-06T09:00:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	try, "sudo nano /etc/fstab"
2007-06-06T09:00:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	careful, though.
2007-06-06T09:03:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	I think there's some specific commands for enabling swap
2007-06-06T09:03:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	something like, swapon/swapoff
2007-06-06T09:03:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	did you try those?
2007-06-06T09:05:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	CTRL + X - It prompts
2007-06-06T09:05:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	are you using "sudo"?
2007-06-06T09:07:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	maybe try editing these files from a liveCD, if you have one - Or boot into recovery mode. Is a re-install feasible?
2007-06-06T09:07:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	you're one step ahead, then ;-)
2007-06-06T09:08:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	probably not. Is there anyway you could make backups? How much disk space is your files taking up now?
2007-06-06T09:15:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	sorry - I don't think so
2007-06-06T09:17:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	your flashdisk will be mounted in /media/ somewhere - My usb disk is in /media/usbdisk, so to copy files, use "cp" command
2007-06-06T09:17:00.000Z	Jimmey	fragger56	something like "cp -r /original/folder /media/usbdisk"
