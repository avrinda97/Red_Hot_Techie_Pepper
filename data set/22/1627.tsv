2010-03-28T23:30:00.000Z	Zenker		http://www.pasteall.org/11996/bash  -here u can see what i did if ure interested
2010-03-28T23:31:00.000Z	Zeedox	Zenker	So it switches backgrounds every delay=15 minutes?
2010-03-28T23:32:00.000Z	Zenker		zeedox yup :) r u can change it to whatever time u want,
2010-03-28T23:33:00.000Z	Zeedox	Zenker	Nice. Where would one put is so that is can run anonymously in the background?
2010-03-28T23:34:00.000Z	Zenker	Zeedox	i would suggest keeping the script file in your pictures folder so u can find it easily, then just goto system, prefs, start up applications and add it
2010-03-28T23:34:00.000Z	Zeedox		Righty
2010-03-28T23:35:00.000Z	Zenker		zeedox it will work wherever u save it, oh, idk if u can dl the script from there so just open gedit and copy n paste it from the bin. you may have 2 chmod +x it to make it executable
2010-03-28T23:36:00.000Z	Zenker		zeedox im thinking about expanding this project and making a gui for it, but idk, it will be a lot for me 2 learn b4 its working
2010-03-28T23:37:00.000Z	Zeedox	Zenker	Well, expanding can be good for teaching yourself I guess, but for these kinds of things sweet and short is the way to go IMO.
2010-03-28T23:39:00.000Z	Zenker		zeedox true very true :) but if i did i would make it to where u can add/remove, change the time, and offer a way to automatically start it up if so desired
2010-03-28T23:40:00.000Z	Zeedox	Zenker	Would be nice.
2010-03-28T23:40:00.000Z	Zenker		zeedox the first issue i need to figure out is how to make it work w/o the pics being a root location, thats buggin the crap out of me
2010-03-28T23:42:00.000Z	Zeedox	Zenker	I've used the basename shell program a bit, maybe that could be of some use to you?
2010-03-28T23:43:00.000Z	Zenker		zeedox what is that?
2010-03-28T23:43:00.000Z	Zeedox	Zenker	But wouldn't it work if you just used something like $HOME/<folder>/<folder>?
2010-03-28T23:44:00.000Z	Zenker		zedox no for some reason it only works if the pics are in a root location, i though about sudo gconf, but then there would be a password issue
2010-03-28T23:45:00.000Z	Zeedox	Zenker	Strange indeed.
2010-03-28T23:46:00.000Z	Zenker		zeedox yah i know, it will change the background but it only shows a solid color when it does if the pics arent in a /root
2010-03-28T23:47:00.000Z	Zenker		zeedox however i havent tried letting it start up automatically w/o them being there
2010-03-28T23:48:00.000Z	Zenker		maybe i should try asking in a scripting channel maybe someone already knows why
2010-03-28T23:48:00.000Z	Zeedox	Zenker	Could it be related to the way gconftool-2 works?
2010-03-28T23:48:00.000Z	Zeedox	Zenker	probably
