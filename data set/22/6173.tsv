2006-12-15T08:59:00.000Z	lovloss		Ubuntu really needs to offer a decent C/C++ IDE in the packages :/
2006-12-15T08:59:00.000Z	agent	lovloss	its called vim ;)
2006-12-15T08:59:00.000Z	lovloss	agent	vim?
2006-12-15T09:00:00.000Z	agent	lovloss	it was a joke (sort of) -- its a VERY instane and powerful editor
2006-12-15T09:00:00.000Z	lovloss	agent	Well i need something. Anjunta keeps asking me to go get 'glib', and eclipse crashes every time i boot up
2006-12-15T09:01:00.000Z	agent	lovloss	you have to realize that a lot hackers dont use ide's tis why they are not really many of them - you would be surprised at how much they keep you from doing your work faster
2006-12-15T09:01:00.000Z	agent	lovloss	why when you can just write a one line script to do that for you? :)
2006-12-15T09:01:00.000Z	lovloss	agent	except that you have to issue two commands to test a source. first, compile, then run
2006-12-15T09:02:00.000Z	agent	lovloss	and you have the advantage of using whatever program you want
2006-12-15T09:02:00.000Z	lovloss	agent	how can that be done in one line?
2006-12-15T09:02:00.000Z	agent	lovloss	depends on what you use... if you use make then: configure && make && make install && binaryfile_that_you_get
2006-12-15T09:03:00.000Z	lovloss	agent	what about libraries?
2006-12-15T09:03:00.000Z	lovloss	agent	is iostream, strings, and such already built in?
2006-12-15T09:03:00.000Z	agent	lovloss	if you are including them then they should be compiled with make... if not then your not using make correctly... or if you are compiling libraries that should not be included :P
2006-12-15T09:04:00.000Z	lovloss	agent	if i #include <library>, where does it load the library from? is there a namespace std somewhere?
2006-12-15T09:04:00.000Z	agent	lovloss	you use make to compile and install a program from source code - if it does not work then you are not using make properly
2006-12-15T09:05:00.000Z	lovloss	agent	Im just curious if I have to go *download* libraries like iostream and stdio
2006-12-15T09:05:00.000Z	agent	lovloss	i cant answer that question because i dont hack c++.... but make is used for just about every language... open up almost any source deb file and you will see make scripts :)
2006-12-15T09:09:00.000Z	agent	lovloss	it is :) make and configure are for "advanced" usage
2006-12-15T09:16:00.000Z	agent	lovloss	you can use just about any kde program in gnome and vice-versa... the problem being is that 1) you have to download kde libs and 2) you have to load them when running the program - they will be loaded themselves of course, but the problem is resource hogging :)
2006-12-15T09:17:00.000Z	lovloss	agent	ahhh i see.... good to know
2006-12-15T09:23:00.000Z	agent	lovloss	tons of places... for c++ i don't know but you can probably look at www.gnome.org in their developers section
