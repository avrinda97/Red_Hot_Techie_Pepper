2012-06-20T19:24:00.000Z	Pirsch		Hello, I tried installing the latest Ubuntu recently and found that on all my rigs, after installation, my mouth and keyboard didn't work. Has that issue been fixed yet?
2012-06-20T19:24:00.000Z	Pirsch		mouse
2012-06-20T19:25:00.000Z	Pirsch		Lol, yeah, yeah, I knew I'd suffer for that typo. :D
2012-06-20T19:26:00.000Z	octaviordz	Pirsch	I have installed in a desktop, laptop and netbook and I didn't have that problem
2012-06-20T19:26:00.000Z	Pirsch		I tried installing on both my desktop and laptop. Everything seems fine until the restart and I cannot sign in. The mouse and the keyboard seem dead.
2012-06-20T19:27:00.000Z	Pirsch		I saw postings where others had the same problem but no answers so I figured I'd wait a month
2012-06-20T19:28:00.000Z	octaviordz	Pirsch	did you use a beta? or the release?
2012-06-20T19:28:00.000Z	Pirsch		release
2012-06-20T19:28:00.000Z	Pirsch		I never do betas. I'm a user, not a hobbyist. :D
2012-06-20T19:29:00.000Z	octaviordz		ok, it's odd that the keyboard is not reconized
2012-06-20T19:30:00.000Z	Pirsch		The other Ubuntu ditros worked fine, but the recent one doesn't
2012-06-20T19:30:00.000Z	Pirsch		Toshiba Satellite
2012-06-20T19:31:00.000Z	Pirsch		I cannot remember, it's at the office
2012-06-20T19:32:00.000Z	octaviordz	Pirsch	strange I also have a tohsiba stellite laptop .. (don't have it around) but is something like a505-someting ...
2012-06-20T19:32:00.000Z	Pirsch		I didn't try the usb keyboard on the laptop cause it didn't work on the desktop
2012-06-20T19:34:00.000Z	octaviordz	Pirsch	did you upgrade?
2012-06-20T19:35:00.000Z	Pirsch		Can't upgrade cause I cannot sign in after first restart. The LiveCD runs perfectly, but once I restart, no mouse and keyboard
2012-06-20T19:35:00.000Z	octaviordz	Pirsch	what I mean is did you upgrade from a older ubuntu release?
2012-06-20T19:36:00.000Z	Pirsch		Nope. Tried that once and had to reistall. I always just do fresh reinstalls
2012-06-20T19:36:00.000Z	Pirsch		I live in China and the net connections are less than perfect, sign upgrading is not the best option
2012-06-20T19:38:00.000Z	octaviordz	Pirsch	acutally I you can upgrade from the LiveCD installer .. is a installer option (not sure if 12.04 is the first one that has this feature)
2012-06-20T19:39:00.000Z	Pirsch	octaviordz	I hadn't noticed that
