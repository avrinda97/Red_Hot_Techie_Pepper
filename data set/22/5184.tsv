2009-02-12T11:39:00.000Z	adante	Gnea	hm strange, for me it's part of noshell package

2009-02-12T11:40:00.000Z	Gnea	adante	runas is kind of opposite of sudo
2009-02-12T11:40:00.000Z	adante	Gnea	so it's sudont?
2009-02-12T11:41:00.000Z	Gnea	adante	sec...
2009-02-12T11:41:00.000Z	Gnea	adante	sudo is for running a command, from a regular user account, as root. runas is for running a command, from a root account, as a regular user.
2009-02-12T11:42:00.000Z	adante	Gnea	hm but sudo -u
2009-02-12T11:43:00.000Z	Gnea	adante	runas â€” program to run daemons as non priviledge users
2009-02-12T11:44:00.000Z	Gnea	adante	it's not for running regular commands, it's for looped programs that stay running
2009-02-12T11:44:00.000Z	Gnea	adante	so, yes, sudo -u would be the solution
2009-02-12T11:45:00.000Z	Gnea	adante	which one?
2009-02-12T11:45:00.000Z	adante	Gnea	redmine

2010-03-05T14:16:00.000Z	Gnea	adante	or just cut 'n paste it if it won't type out
2010-03-05T14:18:00.000Z	Gnea	adante	should be under the accessibility options
2010-03-05T14:18:00.000Z	adante	Gnea	where is that, exactly?
2010-03-05T14:19:00.000Z	Gnea	adante	I think it's under System->Preferences
