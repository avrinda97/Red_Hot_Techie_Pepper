2010-05-01T00:54:00.000Z	red2kic		Hello all. "Can't open log file(s) for writing. Check the permissions on /home/$USER/.xchat2/xchatlogs" -- sudo chown -R didn't do it. How can I check USER ID? I recall such thing does exist. :3
2010-05-01T00:56:00.000Z	guntbert	red2kic	look at the output of ls -l /home/$USER/.xchat2/xchatlogs  and of ls -ld /home/$USER/.xchat2
2010-05-01T00:58:00.000Z	red2kic	guntbert	They both shows chris chris (correctly) but I backed up the ~/.xchat (from karmic) and transfered into lucid.
2010-05-01T01:00:00.000Z	guntbert	red2kic	it might not be the ownership but the permissions -- so what gives ls -l /home/$USER/.xchat2/xchatlogs ?
2010-05-01T01:01:00.000Z	red2kic	guntbert	Bunch of drwx------
2010-05-01T01:03:00.000Z	guntbert	red2kic	no file in ...xchatlogs should have x set
2010-05-01T01:05:00.000Z	red2kic	guntbert	Well I rm -rf * my log history and it display the same thing. It's default, I suppose. There are no point in execution since it's just texts.
2010-05-01T01:06:00.000Z	guntbert	red2kic	yes - I just compared to my settings - all are rw-r--r--
2010-05-01T01:06:00.000Z	guntbert	red2kic	look at ls -ld .xchat2
2010-05-01T01:07:00.000Z	red2kic	guntbert	I see. I'll try and change the permission. Care to pastebin the permissions in ~/.xchat? I wonder if chown -R carelessly on this particular folder is the cause.
2010-05-01T01:08:00.000Z	red2kic	guntbert	drwx (same for .xchat2)
2010-05-01T01:09:00.000Z	guntbert	red2kic	my permissions: http://paste.ubuntu.com/425460/
2010-05-01T01:13:00.000Z	red2kic	guntbert	Brb. I'm going to test it.
2010-05-01T01:17:00.000Z	red2kic	guntbert	It does not work. I'll try and tackle this problem later. Thanks for your attempt.
2010-05-01T01:18:00.000Z	guntbert	red2kic	sorry then :-)
2010-05-08T12:57:00.000Z	guntbert	red2kic	have a look at fuser (= file user)
2010-05-08T12:58:00.000Z	red2kic	guntbert	I found lsof /path/to/file to work. ;O
2010-05-08T12:58:00.000Z	guntbert	red2kic	:-)
2011-01-03T01:50:00.000Z	guntbert	red2kic	http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=  (the default value)
2011-01-03T01:50:00.000Z	red2kic	guntbert	Thank you very much! :)
2011-01-03T01:51:00.000Z	red2kic	guntbert	Ah. Nice. I was trying Bing for some months now. Now I'm back on Google.
2011-04-22T01:50:00.000Z	guntbert	red2kic	"she"
