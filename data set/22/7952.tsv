2005-11-19T11:33:00.000Z	me|ong		what is better
2005-11-19T11:33:00.000Z	me|ong		reiser or ext3?
2005-11-19T11:33:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	depends on the need
2005-11-19T11:33:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	ReiserFS is better for many small files in a medium amount of space (such as an OGG collection), but ext3 is better for overall performance
2005-11-19T11:42:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	well, I don't use ICQ in centericq
2005-11-19T11:42:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	...?
2005-11-19T11:53:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	I'm plagued to use ICQ/AIM only because I'm 15
2005-11-19T11:53:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	and every single person uses it
2005-11-19T11:53:00.000Z	me|ong	Razor-X	lol
2005-11-19T11:54:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	of course, I use IRC much more often
2005-11-19T12:05:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	yeahp
2005-11-19T12:14:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	Fluxbox refused to work on my box, along with XFce
2005-11-19T12:18:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	also known as rxvt-unicode
2005-11-19T12:19:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	oh, meh, I thought it obvious by the name
2005-11-19T12:20:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	you could use it for anything a tty can do
2005-11-19T12:22:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	leafing
2005-11-19T12:23:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	depends on your resources
2005-11-19T12:24:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	urxvt is nice and lightweight and uses xft's, so it's perfect for me
2005-11-19T12:25:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	Ctrl+C won't work in almost any terminal emulator, as I said before
2005-11-19T12:25:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	only because C-c is mapped to interrupt in most UNIX stuff
2005-11-19T12:26:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	... heh, I only use Putty in Windows
2005-11-19T12:27:00.000Z	Razor-X	me|ong	oh yeah, Konsole and Gnome-Terminal work with that
