2010-05-03T23:50:00.000Z	Ken8521	maco	if you say so... nothing is in the kernel log about it though...
2010-05-03T23:49:00.000Z	maco	Ken8521	file a bug on that. "ubuntu-bug linux"
2010-05-03T23:50:00.000Z	Ken8521	maco	its not a bug though.
2010-05-03T23:50:00.000Z	maco	Ken8521	sure it is
2010-05-03T23:50:00.000Z	maco	Ken8521	thatd be a kernel bug
2010-05-03T23:50:00.000Z	Ken8521	maco	a bug, is different than something that doesn't work
2010-05-03T23:50:00.000Z	maco	Ken8521	no its not
2010-05-03T23:51:00.000Z	maco	Ken8521	unless the issue is that the internal mic had its wires cut, its something that can be fixed in the driver
2010-05-03T23:51:00.000Z	maco	Ken8521	a lack of support for hardware is a kernel bug
2010-05-03T23:51:00.000Z	Ken8521	maco	i guess i disagree... i don't see how a lack of support, is a bug.
2010-05-03T23:51:00.000Z	maco	Ken8521	in kernel land it is
2010-05-03T23:51:00.000Z	maco	Ken8521	the only way support will be added is if you file a bug, so do so
2010-05-03T23:52:00.000Z	Ken8521	maco	naa, it doesn't bother me... besides, there's been a bazillion folks who've filed bugs about it.
2010-05-03T23:52:00.000Z	maco	Ken8521	about internal mics not working on $random-other-hardware or on YOUR hardware?
2010-05-03T23:53:00.000Z	Ken8521	maco	well, people w/ my chipset...
2010-05-03T23:53:00.000Z	maco	Ken8521	as defined by "oh look theyre all part of the super-vague hda spec" or as defined be "we have identical subsystem vendor and identificatoin numbers"?
2010-05-03T23:53:00.000Z	Ken8521	maco	what do you think?
2010-05-03T23:54:00.000Z	maco	Ken8521	given that before you said "intelhda" im thinking you, like most people, assumed that all intelhda is the same
2010-05-03T23:54:00.000Z	Ken8521	maco	then you are wrong
2010-05-03T23:55:00.000Z	maco	Ken8521	pleasant surprise then
2010-09-29T04:05:00.000Z	maco	Ken8521	i actually prefered -gnome over normal xchat. easier config screen IMO
2010-09-29T04:06:00.000Z	Ken8521	maco	xchat is just as easy when you get the hang of it. but yea.. i used xchat-gnome for several years, over xchat, for the same reason.. and i still can't warm up to irssi
