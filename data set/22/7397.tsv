2007-04-30T13:31:00.000Z	johns^	darx	mplayer -vo help gives you a list of video output drivers

2007-04-30T13:32:00.000Z	johns^	darx	try mplayer -vo x11 or gl
2007-04-30T13:32:00.000Z	johns^	darx	and then you can put the one that works in .mplayerrc if i remember correctly. man mplayer should tell you where to put it
2007-04-30T13:33:00.000Z	johns^	darx	/etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf should work system wide
