2008-10-13T21:13:00.000Z	r0ach		Guys, I'm deleting my old linux files & folders from my ext3 drive in live CD from the terminal. Now I got nothing left other than the home folder (which I need). It consumes 6gigs on disk. But the drive properties say "11GB used". I also saw this "some parts unreadable" in the window. How do I delete these "unreadable" files ?
2008-10-13T21:14:00.000Z	r0ach		Hope its ok to ask this question here
2008-10-13T21:14:00.000Z	_Zeus_	r0ach	better to copy the files off and make a new partition...
2008-10-13T22:09:00.000Z	_Zeus_	r0ach	use an xp disk to restore the MBR
2008-10-13T22:10:00.000Z	_Zeus_	r0ach	umm, is it still there?
2008-10-13T22:11:00.000Z	_Zeus_	r0ach	you would boot to a recovery console, and type fixmbr
2008-10-13T22:12:00.000Z	_Zeus_	r0ach	is that a problem?
2008-10-13T22:12:00.000Z	_Zeus_	r0ach	umm, i don't think F2 is the proper key

2008-10-13T22:17:00.000Z	_Zeus_	r0ach	what does it say when the cd starts?
2008-10-13T22:20:00.000Z	_Zeus_	r0ach	what do you mean?  you can't boot to anything until you get the mbr fixed
