2007-03-02T17:57:00.000Z	Taime1		i right clicked a link for a stream and saved it, right clicked the pls file, told it that i want to use vlc to play those files, and when i click on a link, it STILL opens it with my mplayer plugin...is there another way to get firefox to open these streams with the player of my choice?
2007-03-02T17:58:00.000Z	Taime1		it used to open streams with an external player.
2007-03-02T06:09:00.000Z	Taime1		how do i get firefox to open streams with an external player like xmms? it used to do that for me, i dont remember when it stopped
2007-03-02T06:11:00.000Z	toodles	Taime1	In firefox, Edit->Preferences->Content->Manage
2007-03-02T06:11:00.000Z	Taime1		.pls files are not in that list of manageable files
2007-03-02T06:12:00.000Z	toodles	Taime1	What happens when you click on a plc file?
2007-03-02T06:12:00.000Z	toodles	Taime1	*pls
2007-03-02T06:12:00.000Z	Taime1		mplayer plugin...bleh!
2007-03-02T06:12:00.000Z	Taime1		embedded
2007-03-02T06:12:00.000Z	toodles	Taime1	1 sec, I'll have a quick look
2007-03-02T06:14:00.000Z	Taime1	TheVault	i have NEVER been able to do it, sorry
2007-03-02T06:14:00.000Z	Taime1		i bought a new card
2007-03-02T06:14:00.000Z	toodles	Taime1	I'm baffeled. It should be there. Doesn't make any sense to me that it's not.
2007-03-02T06:19:00.000Z	Taime1		what would have changed that would cause firefox to stop opening streams in an external player, and START opening them with embedded mplayer plugin?...poop...
2007-03-02T06:21:00.000Z	toodles	Taime1	If only I could think of something. I know it's not the right way of going about it, but you could try uninstalling the mplayer plugin and restarting firefox.
2007-03-02T06:21:00.000Z	Taime1		i guess i could, i was kinda thinking along those lines anyways
2007-03-02T06:21:00.000Z	toodles	Taime1	Then click on a pls file, and when it asks whether to download or open it, you tell it to open it with xmms, and to always do that. Then reinstall the mplayerplugin.
2007-03-02T06:22:00.000Z	Taime1		i bet that'd work man
2007-03-02T06:22:00.000Z	Taime1		ill give it a shot
2007-03-02T06:22:00.000Z	Taime1		its such a pety problem, more of an annoyance... so if this doesnt work, ill give up
2007-03-02T06:22:00.000Z	toodles	Taime1	No idea. But it's the only thing I can't think of that might. Like I said, it doesn't make sense. Sounds like something has a bug. *shrug*
2007-03-02T06:23:00.000Z	toodles	Taime1	Yeah, but annoyances are what make using computers fustrating. I figure there's enough in life to cause hassel without little things like that.
