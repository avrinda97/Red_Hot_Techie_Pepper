2010-02-16T22:08:00.000Z	anothernick		when I run su someotheruser firefox, im told that there's no display specified. how do I fix this?
2010-02-16T22:09:00.000Z	guntbert	anothernick	why would you want to do that? but in any case you *must* use gksudo (not sudo)
2010-02-16T22:11:00.000Z	anothernick	guntbert	ohh.. thanks! I have previously connected with SSH ;P (I need to run firefox with specific cookies sometimes, and it's a shared account.. etcetc it has a purpose.. =)
2010-02-16T22:12:00.000Z	guntbert	anothernick	understood :)
2010-02-16T22:14:00.000Z	anothernick	guntbert	I still get display issues :O
2010-02-16T22:15:00.000Z	anothernick	guntbert	running gksu, typing firefox as program to run and user useriwanttorunas
2010-02-16T22:15:00.000Z	guntbert	anothernick	what does the error say?
2010-02-16T22:16:00.000Z	anothernick	guntbert	No protocol specified | Error: cannot open display: :0.0
2010-02-16T22:17:00.000Z	guntbert	anothernick	ahh, that version (gksu alone by itself) is new to me - I always use gksudo -u user firefox - but back to your problem: did you say you sshed into the machine?
2010-02-16T22:18:00.000Z	anothernick	guntbert	oh you can use -u user :$
2010-02-16T22:20:00.000Z	guntbert	anothernick	but that doesn't solve your problem - did you say you are in a ssh session?
2010-02-16T22:21:00.000Z	anothernick	guntbert	no, I usually have to use ssh, connecting to the same machine through ssh to the user I want to run, ssh with the option -Y, to allow viewing X
2010-02-16T22:22:00.000Z	guntbert	anothernick	that option is -X (not -Y)
2010-02-16T22:22:00.000Z	anothernick	guntbert	I use -Y and it works.. ;o
2010-02-16T22:22:00.000Z	anothernick	guntbert	 -x      Disables X11 forwarding. -    -Y      Enables trusted X11 forwarding.  Trusted X11 forwardings are not subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls.
2010-02-16T22:23:00.000Z	guntbert	anothernick	llutz just looked it up - never needed that before :)
2010-02-16T22:24:00.000Z	anothernick	guntbert	np.  but thats annoying, I should be able to just sh user app.. imo! :)
2010-02-16T22:26:00.000Z	guntbert	anothernick	I must admit that the whole idea is rather strange to me - so no help/solution from me - sorry
2010-02-16T22:27:00.000Z	anothernick	guntbert	hehe its ok, thanks for trying anyway =)
2010-02-16T22:31:00.000Z	guntbert	anothernick	I saw the solution - is that really an ubuntu system? I only used sux on older suse systems
2010-02-16T22:33:00.000Z	anothernick	guntbert	i have no idea, I had to install sux, it was in the regular repo. and then just run it. didnt look more into it. but it sure works fine and is in the ubuntu repo, so to your question I guess yes
2010-02-16T22:34:00.000Z	guntbert	anothernick	ok, thx and have fun
