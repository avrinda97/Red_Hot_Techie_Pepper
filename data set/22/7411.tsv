2007-07-18T10:13:00.000Z	scottDkoDer		<Who_> Bad usb port /device
2007-07-18T10:14:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	damn - it is a new external hard disk caddy
2007-07-18T10:14:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	it's incredible it can actually copy stuff with that resetting every minute
2007-07-18T10:15:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	buckups must happen somehow!
2007-07-18T10:15:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	drivers for usb mass storage surely pretty standard and working by now?
2007-07-18T10:16:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	feisty. I think the killer clue is that this disk used to bring the whole system to complete freeze when used via onboard SATA, with usb it just resets every minute
2007-07-18T10:17:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	it works VERY slowly. 4 hours to copy 8 gig is too long! it's a USB2 plus SATA disk
2007-07-18T10:17:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	cos I got hard freezes trying to get data off the disk using sata.
2007-07-18T10:18:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	I put money on that too but Maxtor/Seagate MacBlast said it was all fine!?
2007-07-18T10:18:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	that's what I'm doing - I just hoped I'd be able to do it faster than I am at the mo :)
2007-07-18T10:19:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	but a usb reset is MUCH better than a kernel freeze - really, it means I can get stuff off!
2007-07-18T10:20:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	I guess so - but it is designed to help them triage supprt requests - for real business with big orders - I doubt theyd fake it
2007-07-18T10:21:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	I'm 1 yr into a 5 yr warranty - so I'll be sure they give me what I have paid for!
2007-07-18T10:22:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	I almost feel sorry for it, watching my syslog keep turning up the messages!
2007-07-18T10:23:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	yea - I hope so too - cos otherwise the linux Sata promise driver is bad too!
2007-07-18T10:23:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	not another one with a SATA connection
2007-07-18T10:24:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	thanks for the help :)
2007-07-18T10:26:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	oh - just to another hard disk of my Dad's temporarily
2007-07-18T10:32:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	yea - I'm tryinhg a desk fan to cool it now - see if that makes the reset less common - that would be mighty interesting (yes, I'm out of _real_ ideas :)
2007-07-18T10:35:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	it's FINISHED!
2007-07-18T10:36:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	bedtime now, really!
2007-07-18T10:36:00.000Z	Who_	scottDkoDer	thanks
