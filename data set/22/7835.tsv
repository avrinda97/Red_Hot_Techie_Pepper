2007-02-28T17:36:00.000Z	holycow		try the one that is accelerated
2007-02-28T17:37:00.000Z	holycow		if so, even if you have nvidia accelerated drivers, only one monitor will actually support ogl
2007-02-28T17:37:00.000Z	holycow		thus stuff on non accelerated monitors will see a performance difference
2007-02-28T17:38:00.000Z	holycow		if your not using accelerated drivers ... then by definition yeah you might still get performance issues
2007-02-28T17:40:00.000Z	holycow		you have been warned
2007-02-28T17:40:00.000Z	holycow		make sure of course that you have backup even with partition magic
2007-02-28T17:41:00.000Z	holycow		they have all the info
2007-02-28T17:41:00.000Z	holycow		actually the gparted is NOT great with ntfs
2007-02-28T17:41:00.000Z	holycow		you have simply been lucky
2007-02-28T17:41:00.000Z	HymnToLife	holycow	yes, ot os
2007-02-28T17:41:00.000Z	HymnToLife		it is, even
2007-02-28T17:41:00.000Z	holycow	HymnToLife	what is?
2007-02-28T17:42:00.000Z	HymnToLife		gparted with ntfs
2007-02-28T17:42:00.000Z	holycow		if you are talking about gparted, then the answer is no re: ntfs support on repartitioning
2007-02-28T17:42:00.000Z	holycow		sorry, wrong
2007-02-28T17:42:00.000Z	holycow	HymnToLife	i don't mean that in a personal way
2007-02-28T17:42:00.000Z	holycow		i just mean that the g1 driver or whatever its called is kinda sorta at 1.0, whatever that means
2007-02-28T17:43:00.000Z	holycow		and its not actually part of any distro, particularly ubuntu
2007-02-28T17:43:00.000Z	holycow		there is no way you can repartition an antfs partition without risk of loosing data, ntfs is proprietary and no one in the open source world has money to pay ms to gain access to that data
2007-02-28T17:43:00.000Z	holycow		beside ms would never agree to a gpld tool anyway
2007-02-28T17:43:00.000Z	HymnToLife	holycow	I agree about that one (it's 3g btw) but what does it have to do with gparted ?
2007-02-28T17:43:00.000Z	holycow	HymnToLife	without it you can't resize an ntfs partition
