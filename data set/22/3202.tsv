2009-12-02T17:28:00.000Z	kjelle		give me a god damn good reason for upgrading from 9.04 to 9.10
2009-12-02T17:28:00.000Z	kjelle		wtf is the difference? everything is just the same all the back to 8.x, possily 7.x
2009-12-02T17:29:00.000Z	jrib	kjelle	no one is telling you to upgrade and you shouldn't if you don't have your own reason to
2009-12-02T17:30:00.000Z	jrib	kjelle	the only time you should upgrade is when the version you are on is about to become unsupported
2010-05-27T16:13:00.000Z	jrib	kjelle	pretty sure all you can do is conflict, but try #ubuntu-motu
2010-09-24T16:06:00.000Z	jrib	kjelle	they need execute permissions on the parent directory
2010-09-24T16:07:00.000Z	kjelle	jrib	ah, ok
2010-09-24T16:08:00.000Z	kjelle	jrib	so g+rx on /srv/app ?
2010-09-24T16:08:00.000Z	jrib	kjelle	well depends on the group (and read isn't necessary)
2010-09-24T16:11:00.000Z	jrib	kjelle	I have no idea what you just said, show with commands in a pastebin
2010-09-24T16:11:00.000Z	kjelle	jrib	okey.
2010-09-24T16:14:00.000Z	jrib	kjelle	you can use ACLs, are you sure it's necessary/
2010-09-24T16:14:00.000Z	kjelle	jrib	i got other groups accessing parent directories
2010-09-24T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	kjelle	is it an issue to just give +x to others?
2010-09-24T16:15:00.000Z	kjelle	jrib	I dont know, im paranoid, could they then execute crap? probably not, as they do not have +x?
2010-09-24T16:16:00.000Z	jrib	kjelle	you can think of +x on a directory as the ability to "cd" into it
2010-09-24T16:16:00.000Z	kjelle	jrib	okey, but you can neither read nor change.
2010-09-24T16:16:00.000Z	jrib	kjelle	right
2010-09-24T16:16:00.000Z	kjelle	jrib	so it's quite safe then i'd guess
2010-09-24T16:17:00.000Z	jrib	kjelle	yeah, that would save you the trouble of setting up ACLs.  With ACLs you could just give the www-data group the +x
2010-09-24T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	kjelle	or www-data user even
2010-10-08T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	kjelle	you can, #vim can probably help you bind it
