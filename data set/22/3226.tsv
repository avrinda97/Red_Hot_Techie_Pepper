2009-08-02T00:26:00.000Z	beefheart		Hello. Today I updated the kernel in 9.04, and after it was done I suddenly lost opengl and d3d support. after many tries changing drivers I am still no closer. my glxinfo: Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
2009-08-02T00:26:00.000Z	beefheart		Error: couldn't find RGB GLX visual or fbconfig: Xlib
2009-08-02T00:27:00.000Z	DouglasK	beefheart	video card?
2009-08-02T00:27:00.000Z	beefheart	DouglasK	geforce 8800gtx
2009-08-02T00:29:00.000Z	beefheart	DouglasK	it did not make any difference.
2009-08-02T00:29:00.000Z	DouglasK	beefheart	there's a kernel module for nvidia ... make sure you pull that out, purge the nvidia package, then reinstall.
2009-08-02T00:29:00.000Z	beefheart	DouglasK	where can I read something about purging ? im not sure what that is
2009-08-02T00:30:00.000Z	DouglasK	beefheart	in Aptitude, just select to Mark for Complete Removal
2009-08-02T00:31:00.000Z	beefheart	DouglasK	that is done. I removed all nvidia packages
2009-08-02T00:32:00.000Z	beefheart	DouglasK	Is there a possibility that the problem is in the xorg.conf ? or would the grep tell me something different then ?
2009-08-02T00:32:00.000Z	DouglasK	beefheart	could be ... make sure the driver is nvidia, not nv.
2009-08-02T00:33:00.000Z	beefheart	DouglasK	that as well didnt make any difference. I can run on both drivers, but i dont get any opengl or d3d in any of them
2009-08-02T00:34:00.000Z	DouglasK	beefheart	well, I'm really not sure what to say then ...
2009-08-02T00:35:00.000Z	beefheart	DouglasK	hehe. thats where i am at atm. This problem was soved at last update for me, but now it was not the same. you got a link to a xorg.conf with opengl and d3d enabled ?
2009-08-02T00:35:00.000Z	DouglasK	beefheart	sure, I'll put mine up on pastebin
2009-08-02T00:36:00.000Z	beefheart	DouglasK	thank you.

2009-08-02T00:37:00.000Z	DouglasK	beefheart	It will stay there for a month in case you need to go back to it.
2009-08-02T00:37:00.000Z	beefheart	DouglasK	thank you.
2009-08-02T00:37:00.000Z	DouglasK	beefheart	you're welcome.  I hope it works out for you!
2009-08-02T00:38:00.000Z	beefheart	DouglasK	I am sure it will, but your config is identical to one of my disfunctional ones... hmm What is the criteria for this opengl to start ? i cant see any reason why it would not, when its one the ubuntu signed drivers, the very same that worked for me for so long.-
2009-08-02T00:40:00.000Z	DouglasK	beefheart	I honestly don't know why the issue.  I have a different video card, so I can't rule out that your card is not properly supported.
