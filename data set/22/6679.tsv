2011-05-06T05:49:00.000Z	FordPrefect		When I find all the files associated iwth one program with locate <program> how do I delete all the files?
2011-05-06T05:50:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	why do you want to do this as opposed to using apt-get?
2011-05-06T05:51:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	why are you downloading vim instead of using apt-get?
2011-05-06T05:52:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	so why would they be untrustworthy?
2011-05-06T05:52:00.000Z	FordPrefect	jrib	because when I downloaded the file from the Ubuntu Software center it told me the file was.
2011-05-06T05:52:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	and you installed it anyway?  What repository?
2011-05-06T05:53:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	 What repository?
2011-05-06T05:53:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	apt-cache policy
2011-05-06T05:54:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	I don't see why that would be untrusted.  Are you sure apt wasn't talking about something else (not the vim package)?
2011-05-06T05:56:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	can you pastebin the actual message?
2011-05-06T05:57:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	is this the entire output?
2011-05-06T05:58:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	pastebin /etc/apt/sources.list*
2011-05-06T05:58:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	and I'm fairly certain that's not the full output
2011-05-06T06:01:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	they are files, open them in a text editor and pastebin the contents
2011-05-06T06:06:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	and there's nothing in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
2011-05-06T06:08:00.000Z	FordPrefect	jrib	I just checked its an empty directory
2011-05-06T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	what does « sudo apt-get update » return?
2011-05-06T06:10:00.000Z	FordPrefect	jrib	it produces a bunch of links from ubuntu.com that it appears to be downloading
2011-05-06T06:10:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	pastebinning is better
2011-05-06T06:13:00.000Z	jrib	FordPrefect	I don't see where you can be getting untrusted packages from.  Maybe we should just troubleshoot your vim issue?
2011-05-06T06:13:00.000Z	FordPrefect	jrib	I think that would be a good idea.
2011-05-06T06:20:00.000Z	FordPrefect	jrib	when I click on the Gvim icon in my applications area it doesnt do anything.
