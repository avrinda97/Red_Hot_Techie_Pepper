2011-02-11T21:28:00.000Z	temb		pls someone help me. when i start ubuntu it connects to my wireless network fine. then i start terminal and do ping google. this works fine the 1st time, sometimes a second time but after 1 or 2 mins it does not respond anymore. the browser behaves the same way. so ubuntu seems to keep the connection to the router, but loses the data connection? i got this problem only on ubuntu10.10 after clean install pls help
2011-02-11T21:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	temb	you can still continue to ping the gateway (router) all the time?  dns problem?  how long or can you resolve an ip to ping yahoo.com
2011-02-11T21:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	temb	try change the dns server to google 8.8.8.8 dns   modify /etc/resolv.conf  to  top line of nameserver 8.8.8.8
2011-02-11T21:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	temb	or test with dig @8.8.8.8 yahoo.com
2011-02-11T21:37:00.000Z	temb	sacarlson	the gateway connection also quits (strange this does not happen with windows?) and works for a short while after reconnecting. did change the dns to 8.8.8.8 :)
2011-02-11T21:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	temb	well if gateway pings quit it's probly not dns
2011-02-11T21:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	temb	now we need to see what hardware you might have  sudo lshw | pastebinit  for us to view what might be the problem
2011-02-11T21:43:00.000Z	temb	sacarlson	can't install pastebinit or go to pastebin. I do know i have an ipw2200 wifi card inside, what else would you need to know?
2011-02-11T21:43:00.000Z	sacarlson	temb	something is better than nothing
2011-02-11T21:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	temb	is it encrypted wep or wpa?
2011-02-11T21:45:00.000Z	temb	sacarlson	wpa2 + mac filter
2011-02-11T21:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	temb	did you ever try unecnrypted?
2011-02-11T21:47:00.000Z	temb	sacarlson	no, it always worked great with ubuntu
2011-02-11T21:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	temb	It would be good to know if the problem is in encryption of driver,  if you don't want to test then try wicd  and/or wpagui
2011-02-11T21:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	temb	always worked great with ubuntu?  8.04?  9.10?  it's not working now how can you say that?
2011-02-11T21:50:00.000Z	temb	sacarlson	i would test it, but i don't have access to the router :( it worked fine untill 10.10, and since the last kernel update this morning the update command keeps timing out
2011-02-11T21:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	temb	oh then simple solution,  set grub to boot the last kernel before upgrade
2011-02-11T21:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	temb	if you need help changeing grub2 boot default then we can help you setup that with a gui startup-manager to modify grub2
2011-02-11T21:52:00.000Z	temb	sacarlson	that works fine (the updating anyway) but the internet still drops connection on that kernel (hoped updating would help) so the whole 10.10 version does not seem to work properly and i want to figure out how to resolve that
2011-02-11T21:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	temb	so it's the same state it was in old version?  why did you say it worked before?
2011-02-11T21:55:00.000Z	temb	sacarlson	the updating and installing apps worked fine, the data connection still dropped quite a lot.
2011-02-11T21:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	temb	well you can't test unecnrypted so I would try my other ideas wicd and wpagui
