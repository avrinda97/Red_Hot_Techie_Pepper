2007-12-03T06:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	froggy__	what step are you getting hung up on?
2007-12-03T06:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	froggy__	where are you getting stuck?
2007-12-03T06:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	froggy__	ok, whats it doing... what error.
2007-12-03T06:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	froggy__	are you using gutsy?
2007-12-03T06:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	froggy__	are you using gutsy?
2007-12-03T06:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	froggy__	you didn't see this right above those insructions.....   You now have to configure xorg to use your graphic card. The aticonfig tool, provided with the driver, will do that for you (aticonfig does not seem to work for Gutsy Gibbons):
2007-12-03T06:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	froggy__	7.10= Gutsy
2007-12-03T07:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	froggy__	its self explanatory, aticonfig doesn't work with gutsy, what part of it do you not understand?
2007-12-03T07:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	froggy__	that i really don't know.
2007-12-03T07:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	froggy__	i'd suggest an Nvidia card, driver takes all of about 5min
2007-12-03T07:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	froggy__	http://www.ubuntuforums.com and there's a search button
2007-12-03T07:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	froggy__	sorry, i can't really hold your hand and teach you how to search.
