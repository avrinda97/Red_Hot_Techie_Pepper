2006-06-07T10:07:00.000Z	max_		Hi
2006-06-07T10:08:00.000Z	max_		Is there a possibility to install ubuntu via ssh?
2006-06-07T10:08:00.000Z	TiG4	max_	No.
2006-06-07T10:08:00.000Z	TiG4	max_	Why would you want to do that?
2006-06-07T10:08:00.000Z	max_	TiG4	fuck
2006-06-07T10:08:00.000Z	TiG4	max_	Watch the language,
2006-06-07T10:09:00.000Z	max_	TiG4	massive graphic problems
2006-06-07T10:09:00.000Z	TiG4	max_	What's wrong?
2006-06-07T10:11:00.000Z	max_	TiG4	any idea?
2006-06-07T10:11:00.000Z	TiG4	max_	You have not described your issue.
2006-06-07T10:12:00.000Z	max_	TiG4	watch above, "xserver doesn't come up, framebuffer freezes"
2006-06-07T10:12:00.000Z	TiG4	max_	Reconfigure xorg.conf
2006-06-07T10:12:00.000Z	max_	TiG4	its on alternate installation...
2006-06-07T10:13:00.000Z	TiG4	max_	Have you installed ubuntu yet
2006-06-07T10:13:00.000Z	max_	TiG4	no
2006-06-07T10:13:00.000Z	TiG4	max_	So it wont even boot off the cd
2006-06-07T10:14:00.000Z	max_	TiG4	live cd? no, xserver crashen in course of wrong modules..i have to patch the kernel before
2006-06-07T10:15:00.000Z	TiG4	max_	I don't know man, you are being too vague
2006-06-07T10:16:00.000Z	max_	TiG4	forget installation via livecd with xserverinstallation. i _have_ to install in textmode.. and textmode freezes during installation progress. so my idea was to install it via ssh so that no framebuffer is able to crash
2006-06-07T10:17:00.000Z	TiG4	max_	Is the cd good?
2006-06-07T10:17:00.000Z	max_	TiG4	i checked twice
2006-06-07T10:20:00.000Z	max_	TiG4	so, no idea, hum?
