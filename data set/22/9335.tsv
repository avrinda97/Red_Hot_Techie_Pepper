2004-12-10T10:05:00.000Z	zenpod		Once I get my new motherboard on monday, this system is becoming Linux-only
2004-12-10T10:05:00.000Z	zenpod		then I have to show my gf and roommate how to use Linux.
2004-12-10T10:06:00.000Z	zenpod		Linux should work for all levels of user
2004-12-10T10:06:00.000Z	zenpod		I use commandline alot, but hey.
2004-12-10T10:07:00.000Z	zenpod		I need to set up the home system to run Apache/PHP/MySQL, and still function normally
2004-12-10T10:07:00.000Z	zenpod		I am guessing those won't take tons of system resources?
2004-12-10T10:07:00.000Z	zenpod		does anyone know?
2004-12-10T10:09:00.000Z	zenpod		*Nukem.
2004-12-10T10:09:00.000Z	zenpod		hurd is based on mach microkernel, I think
2004-12-10T10:10:00.000Z	|QuaD|	zenpod	microkernels are supposedly better
2004-12-10T10:10:00.000Z	zenpod	|QuaD|	that's because, afaik, they don't require a reboot to install/uninstall drivers, etc.
2004-12-10T10:11:00.000Z	|QuaD|	zenpod	i was told they are more effecient also, dunno though
2004-12-10T10:11:00.000Z	zenpod	|QuaD|	I don't know much about OS theory or anything, so I couldn't comment.
2004-12-10T10:11:00.000Z	|QuaD|	zenpod	me neither
2004-12-10T10:12:00.000Z	zenpod	|QuaD|	HURD is so unfinished.

2004-12-10T10:12:00.000Z	zenpod	|QuaD|	Duke Nukem Forever
2004-12-10T10:13:00.000Z	|QuaD|	zenpod	lo
2004-12-10T10:15:00.000Z	|QuaD|	zenpod	according to the hurd website, it looks pretty developed
2004-12-10T10:15:00.000Z	zenpod	|QuaD|	read the install docs.
2004-12-10T10:26:00.000Z	|QuaD|	zenpod	i am
