2006-10-02T07:36:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		All of these are crap
2006-10-02T07:36:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		They aren't anything, they probably are viruses or porn
2006-10-02T07:37:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		i've put these in my repository list 3 times now, and none of them can either be found or updated.
2006-10-02T07:37:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	some reason you feel obligated to repeat that several times?
2006-10-02T07:45:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	when did I say anything that implied you are a complete retard?
2006-10-02T07:45:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	I didn't say anything at all unfriendly or impropper or whatever
2006-10-02T07:46:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	I didn't say "are you sure you are in the right place".
2006-10-02T07:46:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	although, if I had, it wouldn't be an insulting answer.
2006-10-02T07:47:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	windows is wonderful, I think you should stop denying yourself the advantages of using it.
2006-10-02T07:49:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	that's interesting, because there is no build essentials.
2006-10-02T08:13:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	you've been told not only that it's possible, but exactly how to do it, at least 10 times.  So please stop trolling.
2006-10-02T08:14:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	works for me
2006-10-02T08:15:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	yesterday, when I was working with you, when you finally admitted that you had the directory name wrong, you had the path differently.  Of course you may have been wrong then, or you may be wrong now, or both.
2006-10-02T08:16:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	ok, you can write a line on the command line that starts the program?
2006-10-02T08:16:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	put that line into the command field in the launcher
2006-10-02T08:17:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	there shouldn't be anything on that line that has the form   / ./      not with a space, and not without one.
2006-10-02T08:18:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	perhaps you should tell us the line you are typing.
2006-10-02T08:18:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	if you have a line that works at the command prompt, _paste_ it into the launcher
2006-10-02T08:19:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	it won't let you.  what won't let you?
2006-10-02T08:19:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	then put it on the paste site, and give us the url to it.
2006-10-02T08:20:00.000Z	sethk	Sktfeelsdapper	although very likely all you have to do is put a few spaces at the beginning so it doesn't think you are running an IRC command
