2006-07-11T09:26:00.000Z	Burrito		can anyone help me with an apache question?
2006-07-11T09:26:00.000Z	Burrito		I just installed apache2 using apt-get install apache2
2006-07-11T09:27:00.000Z	Burrito		when I opened up httpd.conf...it says something to the effect that it's no longer being used
2006-07-11T09:27:00.000Z	Burrito		how do I configure the server w/o it?
2006-07-11T09:27:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	You can't
2006-07-11T09:28:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	It's the Debian-specific apache stuff
2006-07-11T09:28:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	Look in sites-available under /etc/apache2 for examples
2006-07-11T09:28:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	Then use "sudo a2esite [filename] " to enable the site you just made
2006-07-11T09:29:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	Makes a lot more sense then using httpd.conf solely, the Debian layout makes a lot more sense, you'll fall in love with it
2006-07-11T09:30:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	I don't have apache2 installed right now, give me just one sec to do so
2006-07-11T09:30:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	Np
2006-07-11T09:31:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	To get started, use this command "vi default" to look at the default site's config file
2006-07-11T09:31:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	Simple, eh?
2006-07-11T09:32:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	Yup, then edit the file, and finally, use "sudo a2ensite someothersite"
2006-07-11T11:05:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	Lovely
2006-07-11T11:06:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	Not sure what's going on
2006-07-12T06:36:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	That's annoying
2006-07-12T06:41:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	GNOME Menu Bar -> Places -> Connect to Server
2006-07-12T06:43:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	After you install the Samab server, look at System -> Administration -> Shared Folders :)
2006-07-12T06:44:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	???
2006-07-12T06:44:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	Why not?
2006-07-12T06:49:00.000Z	[Tkb] FIRESIDE	Burrito	"sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"?
