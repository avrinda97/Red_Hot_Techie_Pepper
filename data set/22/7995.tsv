2006-01-03T09:06:00.000Z	SpaceBass		evening
2006-01-03T09:08:00.000Z	SpaceBass		I set-up a dual boot system then blew away the ubuntu drive in Windows... now I get a grub error -17... to be fair I'm considerably more proficient in windows, but I've tried everything I know (recovery console- fixboot, fixmbr)... I cannot remember if I installed grub in the MBR or the first sector... anyone have hints?
2006-01-03T09:08:00.000Z	sklav	SpaceBass	u trying to recover windows?
2006-01-03T09:08:00.000Z	SpaceBass	sklav	 desperatly
2006-01-03T09:09:00.000Z	SpaceBass	sklav	 I broke down and bought a 2nd box to run ubuntu on, so I didn;t need to dual boot anymore
2006-01-03T09:09:00.000Z	SpaceBass	sklav	100% sure the windows parititon is still there
2006-01-03T09:10:00.000Z	SpaceBass	sklav	yeah... thats what I used, can get to the c:\ prompt
2006-01-03T09:10:00.000Z	SpaceBass	sklav	 and I can run bootcfg /scan  and it finds the windows install
2006-01-03T09:10:00.000Z	SpaceBass	sklav	yeah I ran fixmbr and fixboot ... several times... no dice
2006-01-03T09:11:00.000Z	SpaceBass	sklav	 now that being said... the drive is on a 3rd party ATA controller and I don't have the floppy with the drivers... so I pulled the drive and threw it in a USB inclosure... not sure if that would matter
2006-01-03T09:14:00.000Z	sklav	SpaceBass	you did fixboot c:
2006-01-03T09:15:00.000Z	SpaceBass	sklav	well.... I did fixboot, I didn't specify the drive... and if its that simple I'm going to kick my self in the nuts
2006-01-03T09:16:00.000Z	SpaceBass	sklav	I mean... I'd never run fidisk with out the drive or mount with out the dev ... not sure why I'd be that dumb
2006-01-03T09:16:00.000Z	sklav	SpaceBass	try both commands again but make sure you specify the drive for fixboot and fixmbr
2006-01-03T09:16:00.000Z	SpaceBass	sklav	thanks
2006-01-03T09:17:00.000Z	sklav	SpaceBass	any luck?
2006-01-03T09:17:00.000Z	SpaceBass	sklav	& ssstormy ... thanks! I'm going to try fixmbr and fixboot with the drive specified (and smack myself), if that doesnt work, I'll copy the ./xp_mbr from a working drive
2006-01-03T09:18:00.000Z	SpaceBass	sklav	 I'm in front of the TV right now... left my office when I got uber fustrated... going to go try again now
2006-01-03T09:18:00.000Z	sklav	SpaceBass	if in question use the map option to figure out what name windows wants
2006-01-03T09:24:00.000Z	sklav	SpaceBass	Outlook is a bit of a memory hog
2006-01-03T09:24:00.000Z	SpaceBass	sklav	 true that!
2006-01-03T09:27:00.000Z	SpaceBass	sklav	 yeah, I suspect the x86 port of os x will help a lot in that regard
