2005-06-03T12:31:00.000Z	stalagna		sorry about htat
2005-06-03T12:32:00.000Z	stalagna		  usr/bin/kdm
2005-06-03T12:32:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	it should have a leading / ( /usr/bin/kdm )
2005-06-03T12:32:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	OK
2005-06-03T12:33:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	what does ` dpkg -l kdm ` say ?
2005-06-03T12:34:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	if you reboot you should get kdm
2005-06-03T12:39:00.000Z	stalagna	bystander	so what is the line to change the default display manager
2005-06-03T12:40:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	the one I originally gave you will say permission denied or similar
2005-06-03T12:40:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	it's a quirk of the sudo method
2005-06-03T12:41:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	no
2005-06-03T12:42:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	kdm works too
2005-06-03T12:42:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	the lock up is some other issue I guess
2005-06-03T12:43:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	you typed your user name first, didn't you ?
2005-06-03T12:46:00.000Z	stalagna	bystander	ok, everything was working fine until he had me run the install, and then after it, i ran KDE once with no problems, logged out and tried getting back into GNOME and got the blank screen
2005-06-03T12:46:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	which install was that?
2005-06-03T12:50:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	can you still log into KDE ?
2005-06-03T12:51:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	choose it from sessions in the login screen
2005-06-03T12:56:00.000Z	stalagna	bystander	it looks like i can get into KDE
2005-06-03T12:57:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	it *might* be a sound server issue in gnome
2005-06-03T12:58:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	I doubt that's necessary
2005-06-03T12:59:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	I can't recall the command, but someone else might know how to turn off the sound server for gnome: you *could* try typing"killall esd"
2005-06-03T13:00:00.000Z	bystander	stalagna	OK - good luck then
