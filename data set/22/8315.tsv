2005-10-01T05:11:00.000Z	coarsesalt		I'm doing a review of 'ease of use" of ubuntu for our podcast next week... any other 'goto' websites I should use other than the ubuntu wiki and ubuntuguide?
2005-10-01T05:11:00.000Z	Seveas	coarsesalt	don't use ubuntuguide
2005-10-01T05:11:00.000Z	coarsesalt	Seveas	me neither
2005-10-01T05:14:00.000Z	Seveas	coarsesalt	for the educational industry you should also keep an eye on edubuntu
2005-10-01T05:15:00.000Z	coarsesalt	Seveas	yeah... i installed it the day it came out, and have talked a bit with them... not really what I'm looking for right now...
2005-10-01T05:15:00.000Z	coarsesalt	Seveas	it's great. For techies. I don't need teachers to set up thin-clients... I just need them to keep their computers running with decent software that doesn't cost a fortune
2005-10-01T05:17:00.000Z	Seveas	coarsesalt	then it's just ubuntu :)
2005-10-01T05:21:00.000Z	coarsesalt	Seveas	that was the conclusion i came to after my edubuntu install... from all i've seen, ubuntu is a year away. Very close. But not quite.
2005-10-01T05:21:00.000Z	coarsesalt	Seveas	I, however, love it!
2005-10-01T05:21:00.000Z	Seveas	coarsesalt	half a year ;)
2005-10-01T05:22:00.000Z	coarsesalt	Seveas	I'll hold you to that
2005-10-01T05:22:00.000Z	coarsesalt	Seveas	I was thinking the start of 2006-2007 academic. I'm hoping to tie it into webcasting, bloggin and podcasting using ubuntu as a multimedia platform as it gets more important for ed-people
2005-10-01T05:23:00.000Z	Seveas	coarsesalt	by that time breezy+2 is not yet released, releases are always in october and april
2005-10-01T05:25:00.000Z	coarsesalt	Seveas	breezy+1 is perfect, as I need to start convincing people at least by april to get them converted by september. I might even have to use breezy, which brings me back to why I need sites like ubuntu guide to show people "how easy it is"
2005-10-01T05:25:00.000Z	Seveas	coarsesalt	did you look at the docteam website?
2005-10-01T05:25:00.000Z	coarsesalt	Seveas	nope. got a link?
2005-10-01T05:26:00.000Z	Seveas	coarsesalt	http://doc.ubuntu.com/
2005-10-01T05:28:00.000Z	coarsesalt	Seveas	yeah. my point exactly actually unfortunately. The sun version is one update behind. Which is No Problem for me, but will be for what we like to call 'middle adopters'
2005-10-01T05:29:00.000Z	Seveas	coarsesalt	sun version?
2005-10-01T05:31:00.000Z	coarsesalt	Seveas	sorry. Java. I suppose i should just sign in and fix it... I'm new to this really. Just gotten over the hump of really not knowing what I'm doing, to knowing enough to get myself into trouble
2005-10-01T05:31:00.000Z	Seveas	coarsesalt	sun java is not legally distributable :)
2005-10-01T05:32:00.000Z	coarsesalt	Seveas	cheers
