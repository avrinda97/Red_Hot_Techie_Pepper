2007-01-05T08:53:00.000Z	linux1		anyone heard about any  problems with sound recording in 6.10 being very low , as in mic gain is too low?
2007-01-05T08:54:00.000Z	crimsun	linux1	there are known issues depending on which codec you use.
2007-01-05T08:54:00.000Z	linux1	crimsun	sound recorder, wav
2007-01-05T08:55:00.000Z	crimsun	linux1	no, the codec. See ``tail -2 /proc/asound/oss/sndstat''
2007-01-05T08:55:00.000Z	linux1	crimsun	ive installed w32codecs, and the gain is all the way up
2007-01-05T08:56:00.000Z	crimsun	linux1	no, not a software codec, a -hardware- codec. I gave you command, the output from which you need to tell me.
2007-01-05T08:57:00.000Z	crimsun	linux1	ok, from the output of ``amixer'', do you see a Mic Boost?
