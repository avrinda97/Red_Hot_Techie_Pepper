2011-11-20T17:19:00.000Z	Draethelf		Hey, I'm having trouble mounting an external harddrive, anyone on to help?
2011-11-20T17:20:00.000Z	Draethelf		If anyone knows anything at all, it'd be helping more than google is right now.
2011-11-20T17:22:00.000Z	Draethelf		Okay, so I plug in my external, and it says "unable to mount 871 GB filesystem" Exit code is 12: NTFS signature is missing.
2011-11-20T17:23:00.000Z	Draethelf		Then a second one pops up saying the same thing, but 329 or whatever (GBs)
2011-11-20T17:23:00.000Z	Draethelf		.. I just did.
2011-11-20T17:24:00.000Z	Draethelf		... so lets pretend I'm totally new to Ubuntu... and linux in general... see, my ex installed it on my laptop, and I never had a problem with it before now.
2011-11-20T17:25:00.000Z	Draethelf		Yes, I do. and it works fine on windows 7
2011-11-20T17:25:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Draethelf	Sounds like you mounted it in windows and failed to "Safely Remove Hardware", in win?
2011-11-20T17:27:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Draethelf	Other than that, a hardware problem with the HD, itself; perhaps you could run 'Disk Utility' from System--> Administration..
2011-11-20T17:28:00.000Z	Draethelf	Sidewinder1	like this?
2011-11-20T17:31:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Draethelf	After we work out the ext HD problem, have a look here for a general 'How-to' for Ubuntu: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/index
2011-11-20T17:33:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Draethelf	This is another, general, good one:.. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_%28operating_system%29
2011-11-20T17:36:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Draethelf	Go to System-->Administration--> Disk Utility and have a look, there.
2011-11-20T17:38:00.000Z	Draethelf	Sidewinder1	It shows up in the DU... which is weird...
2011-11-20T17:39:00.000Z	Draethelf	Sidewinder1	but if I open the home folder, and try to click on the harddrive, it says "Cannot mount"
2011-11-20T17:39:00.000Z	Draethelf	Sidewinder1	Also, why does it list my harddrive as 2 HDD?
2011-11-20T17:40:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Draethelf	What usr13 said.. 2 HDD is probably the Name you used for the disk in Win.
2011-11-20T17:41:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Draethelf	In win, run chkdsk to fix errors.
2011-11-20T17:41:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Draethelf	Two partitions on the drive.
2011-11-20T17:42:00.000Z	Draethelf	Sidewinder1	It's not partitioned though. Plus in the Disk Utility it shows up as one.
2011-11-20T17:43:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Draethelf	Then I'm not sure.. :-(
2011-11-20T17:43:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Draethelf	Bobbi for president! :-)
