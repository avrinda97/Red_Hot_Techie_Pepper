2010-05-27T07:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	webPragmatist	for eveything list there, you will want to do.. dpkg --purge <all packages listed in previous command>
2010-05-27T10:00:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	webPragmatist	hi, i might try to help with that. as long as your not wanting an /etc/fstab file setup. i haven't messed with that in a long time
2010-05-27T10:00:00.000Z	webPragmatist	onetinsoldier	well

2010-05-27T10:02:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	webPragmatist	yeah, don't know that i can help. i don't even know what 'drbd' is. thought that might have been a typo
2010-05-27T20:43:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	webPragmatist	have you tried the 'tail' command?
2010-05-27T20:43:00.000Z	webPragmatist	onetinsoldier	yes but because it's not "adding" new lines it's not working
2010-05-27T20:44:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	webPragmatist	paste in what command you used
2010-05-27T20:45:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	webPragmatist	you didn't tell it what file? like --> tail -f /proc/net/ipv4  ...just an example
