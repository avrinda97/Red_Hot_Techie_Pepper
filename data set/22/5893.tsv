2007-07-30T11:23:00.000Z	DimitrisC		I installed pidgin and my nautilus-send-to menu was uninstalled in the process due to some bug. Is there an updated package for the nautilus-send-to feature for pidgin and feisty as in gutsy?
2007-07-30T11:25:00.000Z	_Andrew	DimitrisC	I am confused are you using feisty or gutsy?
2007-07-30T11:26:00.000Z	DimitrisC		Andrew: Feisty
2007-07-30T11:26:00.000Z	_Andrew	DimitrisC	Did you build from source?
2007-07-30T11:26:00.000Z	_Andrew	DimitrisC	You could have just got the deb package from getdeb.com
2007-07-30T11:26:00.000Z	DimitrisC		Andrew: No I used synaptic. It unistalled gaim, gaim-data and nautilus-send-to
2007-07-30T11:27:00.000Z	DimitrisC		Andrew: I searched ubuntu packages website and nautilus-send-to with pidgin support is only available for gutsy
2007-07-30T11:28:00.000Z	_Andrew	DimitrisC	So you installed a Gutsy package on Feisty by modifying your sources list?
2007-07-30T11:28:00.000Z	DimitrisC		I was just wondering if anyone came across such a package for feisty
2007-07-30T11:30:00.000Z	DimitrisC		Andrew: Ok I think I wasn't very clear :-) I installed pidgin in feisty. Synaptic said that in order to install pidgin it needed to remove gaim, gaim data and nautilus-send-to. I am just wondering how I can install nautilus-send-to again without removing pidgin.
2007-07-30T11:31:00.000Z	DimitrisC		Andrew: The only nautilus-send-to package I found with pidgin support instead of gaim was for gutsy and thats no good since I am using feisty
2007-07-30T11:31:00.000Z	_Andrew	DimitrisC	I am just wondering how you installed pidgin because it isn't avaliable in the feisty repository.

2007-07-30T11:33:00.000Z	DimitrisC	_Andrew	Got it from linux mint repos
2007-07-30T11:34:00.000Z	DimitrisC	_Andrew	After all linux mint its just ubuntu with a couple of addons :-)
2007-07-30T11:34:00.000Z	_Andrew	DimitrisC	If you remove the packages you installed would your system return to normal? Then try giving the getdeb package for ubuntu a try?
2007-07-30T11:35:00.000Z	DimitrisC	_Andrew	Yes if I remove pidgin I can install nautilus-send-to just fine and have my menu back. I will try getdeb as well. Thnx!
2007-07-30T11:36:00.000Z	_Andrew	DimitrisC	hang on i'll get you the link
2007-07-30T11:36:00.000Z	DimitrisC	_Andrew	No need got it
2007-07-30T11:36:00.000Z	DimitrisC	_Andrew	Google is my friend :-)
2007-07-30T11:36:00.000Z	_Andrew		ok
2007-07-30T11:36:00.000Z	DimitrisC	_Andrew	Thnx
