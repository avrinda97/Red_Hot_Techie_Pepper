2007-08-21T14:17:00.000Z	RadicalME		what would be a good linux application to start programming on"?
2007-08-21T14:17:00.000Z	dariuskane	RadicalME	thats a loaded question... each tool and language has its strengths... you need to know what your trying to accomplish first
2007-08-21T14:20:00.000Z	dariuskane	RadicalME	you really need to figure out WHAT you want to create first and for what platforms before you decide on a language and later decide on the proper tools
2007-08-21T14:24:00.000Z	dariuskane	RadicalME	if you want to build interface and userland visual apps... look at Python.. it can connect to all kinds of libs for gtk and kde and more
2007-08-21T14:25:00.000Z	RadicalME	dariuskane	that sounds familiar... i thought i saw it somewere on my installation.. is it a script only program or also like dragging and dropping certain entinities
2007-08-21T14:25:00.000Z	dariuskane	RadicalME	Python is an interpreted language... its the logic behind alot of gui apps
2007-08-21T14:26:00.000Z	RadicalME	dariuskane	is it at synaptic? if yes, is there documentation supplied also?
2007-08-21T14:26:00.000Z	dariuskane	RadicalME	you need a seperate lib of function to make the windows and buttons and boxs
2007-08-21T14:26:00.000Z	dariuskane	RadicalME	Im sure you can find many python packages in the installer
2007-08-21T14:27:00.000Z	RadicalME	dariuskane	ok thank you, will you stay for a while so i can contact you if needed?
2007-08-21T14:27:00.000Z	dariuskane	RadicalME	ya Ill be here awhile
2007-08-21T14:28:00.000Z	RadicalME	dariuskane	GTK+ 2 User Interface Builder (with GNOME 2 support) that would be that interface builder right?
2007-08-21T14:28:00.000Z	dariuskane	RadicalME	yes that is the all the widgets, the visual stuff, for making gnome apps....
2007-08-21T14:29:00.000Z	dariuskane	RadicalME	its not a drag and drop interface builder... you can find glade to do that with
2007-08-21T14:29:00.000Z	RadicalME	dariuskane	yea i didnt expect dragging and dropping anyways :D
2007-08-21T14:30:00.000Z	RadicalME	dariuskane	so how do i start python? terminal?
2007-08-21T14:31:00.000Z	dariuskane	RadicalME	like I mentioned python is an interpreted language so you write a python script with any kind of text editor and run it
2007-08-21T14:32:00.000Z	RadicalME	dariuskane	got documentation so i can get started?
2007-08-21T14:33:00.000Z	dariuskane	RadicalME	http://python.org/
2007-08-21T14:33:00.000Z	RadicalME	dariuskane	ty for the info
2007-08-21T14:34:00.000Z	dariuskane	RadicalME	NP good luck.... btw python is even showing up mre and more in MMORPGs these days
2007-08-21T14:34:00.000Z	RadicalME	dariuskane	thats cool... :D
