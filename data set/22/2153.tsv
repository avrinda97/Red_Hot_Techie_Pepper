2009-11-30T21:35:00.000Z	ManDay_		can anyone quickly tell me how large /boot is?
2009-11-30T21:36:00.000Z	ManDay_		thanks erUSUL
2009-11-30T21:37:00.000Z	ManDay_		does it make sense to reserve 0% for su on all partitions but /boot (where i reserve 20% for su) ?
2009-11-30T21:38:00.000Z	ManDay_		in /var?
2009-11-30T21:39:00.000Z	ManDay_		ah right
2009-11-30T21:40:00.000Z	ManDay_		nvm. yeah just wondering what's the point of that reserved space. someone claimed that it can be some sort of fallback to enable SU to log in in extreme situations
2009-11-30T21:40:00.000Z	ManDay_		but i really dont get the point
2009-11-30T21:41:00.000Z	ManDay_		thanks genii
2009-11-30T21:42:00.000Z	ManDay_		are you sure?
2009-11-30T21:43:00.000Z	ManDay_		because it says "reserved for su"
2009-11-30T21:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ManDay_	 5% of ext3/2/4 is reserved for recocovery options. (lost+found) its tuneable with the tune2fs command
2010-07-15T00:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ManDay_	 grub bootloader uses those files, unless ive missunderstood your problem
2010-07-15T00:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ManDay_	 it has to get to them some how
2010-07-15T00:06:00.000Z	ManDay_	Dr_Willis	I've caused quite a mess in my /boot with multiple kernels tangled up in eachother and im trying to clean it up a little by removing and and then cleanly featching the 23 kernel
2010-07-15T00:06:00.000Z	ManDay_	Dr_Willis	if I reinstall grub that should do it?
2010-07-15T00:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ManDay_	 ewww. :)  I guess you can try.
2010-07-15T00:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ManDay_	 you could  try to set up /boot/ on the / not on its own parittion. but that may break things worse
2010-07-15T00:10:00.000Z	ManDay_	Dr_Willis	I once thought it was a clever idea to set /boot no noauto in fstab - turns out how horribly wrong i was
2010-07-15T00:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ManDay_	 on ubuntu.. yes. :) Gentoo does that by default i recall
2010-07-15T00:11:00.000Z	ManDay_	Dr_Willis	thats why i did it - remembered to have read it would be clever , lol
2010-07-15T00:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ManDay_	 i  got about a 3gb /boot/ :) i keep spare iso files on it i can boot with grub2 :)
2010-07-15T00:12:00.000Z	ManDay_	Dr_Willis	i have a little cleaning up quirk ;)
