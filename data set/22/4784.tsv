2007-11-26T15:11:00.000Z	wers		 before, the desktop icon of my flv video is a frame from the video. now that I reformatted, it just looks like a blank white paper. how do I make the icon a frame from the vid again? :D
2007-11-26T15:13:00.000Z	tomd	wers	have you opened the video yet?
2007-11-26T15:14:00.000Z	tomd	wers	try opening it in totem or whatever kde uses to play videos if you're on kde
2007-11-26T15:14:00.000Z	wers		okay. tomd :D
2007-11-26T15:15:00.000Z	tomd		i tried switching my system over to kde, then kaffeine wouldn't properly play videos, so I blew it off, I think i like gnome better anyway
2007-11-26T15:15:00.000Z	wers		I opened it already tomd...
2007-11-26T15:15:00.000Z	wers		no diff
2007-11-26T15:16:00.000Z	tomd		I just tried on one of mine.. blank page, then a few minutes of being in the directory and opening the file, they changed to pictures
2007-11-26T15:17:00.000Z	tomd		dunno why yours isn't doing it..  there must be a preference for it somewhere..
2007-11-26T15:19:00.000Z	tomd	wers	i solved your problem
2007-11-26T15:19:00.000Z	wers		tomd!!!
2007-11-26T15:19:00.000Z	wers		yes??
2007-11-26T15:19:00.000Z	tomd	wers	run gconf-editor from a terminal
2007-11-26T15:19:00.000Z	wers		and then, tomd? :D
2007-11-26T15:20:00.000Z	tomd	wers	go to desktop->gnome->thumbnailers->video@flv and make sure enable is checked
2007-11-26T15:21:00.000Z	tomd	wers	also make sure gnome-video-thumbnailer is installed
2007-11-26T15:21:00.000Z	wers	tomd	$ gnome-video-thumbnailer
2007-11-26T15:21:00.000Z	wers		Expects an input and an output file
2007-11-26T15:21:00.000Z	wers		mmm
2007-11-26T15:22:00.000Z	tomd	wers	ok, so its there, did you check the gconf setting I showed you, is enable checked?
2007-11-26T15:22:00.000Z	wers	tomd	yes :D
2007-11-26T15:23:00.000Z	tomd	wers	well, everything is in working order.. do other filetypes work? maybe its a newer version of the codec, etc. im not really sure
