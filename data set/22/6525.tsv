2006-10-02T11:00:00.000Z	orestyle3		I have just installed ubuntu but am having issues with network connectivity not working
2006-10-02T11:00:00.000Z	orestyle3		pinging does not work, changing from static to DHCP does not resolve issue
2006-10-02T11:01:00.000Z	orestyle3		Sometimes I get connectivity, then it fails
2006-10-02T11:01:00.000Z	raygn2	orestyle3	using wireless or wired or both
2006-10-02T11:03:00.000Z	raygn2	orestyle3	is it configured and running for all levels of running
2006-10-02T11:05:00.000Z	raygn2	orestyle3	are u only trying this while logged into the GUI
2006-10-02T11:05:00.000Z	orestyle3	raygn2	yes
2006-10-02T11:06:00.000Z	raygn2	orestyle3	 try this, open a terminal up, then sudo ifdown eth0, then sudo ifup eth0
2006-10-02T11:07:00.000Z	raygn2	orestyle3	then try to ping an ip if that works then try to ping an address like google.com
2006-10-02T11:07:00.000Z	orestyle3	raygn2	 funny thing is when I can connect to the internet, it is only for a short time, then I loose connection again
2006-10-02T11:08:00.000Z	orestyle3	raygn2	 still shows destination host unreachable.  Trying to ping dfgw and other local hosts
2006-10-02T11:08:00.000Z	raygn2	orestyle3	this at home or work and have u used this machine with a differant os and connect ok
2006-10-02T11:09:00.000Z	orestyle3	raygn2	 Yes, can connect no problem with etch and nt.
2006-10-02T11:10:00.000Z	orestyle3	raygn2	 I also dont loose connectivity with the other OS's
2006-10-02T11:10:00.000Z	raygn2	orestyle3	 I would almost say the driver is not installed or configured properly for that card
2006-10-02T11:11:00.000Z	orestyle3	raygn2	 I also have no problems when just running off the disk
2006-10-02T11:11:00.000Z	raygn2	orestyle3	  i would boot itup with the live cd and then look at the drivers and configurations make note of them and then reboot to the installed os
2006-10-02T11:12:00.000Z	raygn2	orestyle3	 compare them and make any needed changes
2006-10-02T11:13:00.000Z	orestyle3	raygn2	 I am still new to debian/ubuntu so where would I best find the drivers? and what would I best be looking for?
2006-10-02T11:15:00.000Z	orestyle3	raygn2	 Ok, so I disconnected the network cable from the wall, reconnected it and was able to get a good ping, then about 30 seconds later, I lost connectivity...
2006-10-02T11:15:00.000Z	orestyle3	raygn2	 Seems like it would be something in the wall, but I am still, with other os's, able to get connected and ping other machines...
2006-10-02T11:16:00.000Z	raygn2	orestyle3	 i would use the systemsettings to run a comparison for now
