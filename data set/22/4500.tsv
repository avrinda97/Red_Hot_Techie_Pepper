2008-08-15T11:35:00.000Z	FAJALOU		i am trying to see a vista computer from my ubuntu machine.  It does not show up in the workgroup but if i manually type in the ip address (smb://192.168.1.101/users) i can see some files... how can i just get the vista machine to show up in network?
2008-08-15T11:37:00.000Z	zcat[1]	FAJALOU	if you have firestarter set up, allow broadcast traffic as well as the samba ports.. otherwise just wait, SMB is a weird protocol and machines can take 15 minutes to announce themselves to the master browser and start showing up.
2008-08-15T11:38:00.000Z	FAJALOU	zcat[1]	i do have firestarter;
2008-08-15T11:38:00.000Z	FAJALOU	zcat[1]	 how can i set up what you sai?
2008-08-15T11:39:00.000Z	zcat[1]	FAJALOU	well, a common problem with SMB is that it uses broadcast packets for machines to announce themselves, and TCP for them to actually connect. If you enable the TCP ports but not broadcast trffic, you will see what you describe, you can connect by IP but the machine never shows up in the network browser
2008-08-15T11:41:00.000Z	zcat[1]	FAJALOU	in the firestarter preferences, 'advanced options' the default is to filter broadcast packets. Uncheck those options.
2008-08-15T11:42:00.000Z	FAJALOU	zcat[1]	uncheck "block broadcasts from external networks" ?
2008-08-15T11:42:00.000Z	zcat[1]	FAJALOU	yep. On a typical DSL or cable modem network your 'external network' is your LAN..
2008-08-15T11:43:00.000Z	FAJALOU	zcat[1]	but in this case it is the wlan network?
2008-08-15T11:43:00.000Z	zcat[1]	FAJALOU	just uncheck both, it ought to be safe enough ;)
2008-08-15T11:43:00.000Z	FAJALOU	zcat[1]	 PM?
2008-08-15T11:44:00.000Z	zcat[1]	FAJALOU	no
2008-08-15T11:45:00.000Z	zcat[1]	FAJALOU	broadcast packets are pretty harmless, I wouldn't be too concerned about not filtering them even on a real-world interface anyhow..
2008-08-15T11:45:00.000Z	FAJALOU	zcat[1]	 ok... so in policies, should i just enable any packets from 192.168.1.101?
2008-08-15T11:46:00.000Z	zcat[1]	FAJALOU	yes, or from the whole 192.168.0.0/16 range if you want..
2008-08-15T11:47:00.000Z	FAJALOU	zcat[1]	 in policies how can i allow any connection from 192.168.1.100-192.168.1.105?
2008-08-15T11:47:00.000Z	FAJALOU	zcat[1]	but still...  in policies how can i allow any connection from 192.168.1.100-192.168.1.105?
2008-08-15T11:49:00.000Z	FAJALOU	zcat[1]	 what does that do?
2008-08-15T11:50:00.000Z	zcat[1]	FAJALOU	allowes the whole range of 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.254.254 -- they're non-routable addresses so you should never see any traffic in that range except from inside your LAN
2008-08-15T11:50:00.000Z	FAJALOU	zcat[1]	 ok thank you.
2008-08-15T11:51:00.000Z	FAJALOU	zcat[1]	 but what if someone hacks our network (doubt it it's wpa psk2 but still)  would they have access to my files?
2008-08-15T11:58:00.000Z	zcat[1]	FAJALOU	just press enter?
