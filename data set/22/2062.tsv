2009-10-09T08:45:00.000Z	mateusrp		hello, anybody experiencing X crashing on login? I'm running the latest jaunty with Intel i945. If I set Option "NoAccel" "True" it works (obviously without glx). Otherwise I fall back to console with a msg saying that i915_dri.so crashed, libglx.so and libc6.so made smth crash... any ideas?
2009-10-09T08:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mateusrp	Is this a new problem or has it done this since install?
2009-10-09T08:46:00.000Z	mateusrp	Jordan_U	new problem. Started happening today, after I updated the sys
2009-10-09T08:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mateusrp	Do you remember what you updated?
2009-10-09T08:47:00.000Z	mateusrp	Jordan_U	not everything. But the intel driver was one of them, and I already knew it might give problems. I downgraded it (as i used to do) but this time it still doesnt work. What concerns me is that libc6 was also upgrade...
2009-10-09T08:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mateusrp	Just to make sure the upgrade completed completely check that "sudo apt-get -f install" does nothing
2009-10-09T08:49:00.000Z	mateusrp	Jordan_U	it did, already tried that
2009-10-09T08:50:00.000Z	mateusrp	Jordan_U	i already went through google and the forums.. tried everything they said... only this "noaccel" allows me to login
2009-10-09T08:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mateusrp	When you downgraded did you downgrade both the intel and xserver packages?
2009-10-09T08:50:00.000Z	mateusrp	Jordan_U	only intel. The others weren't upgraded, I guess
2009-10-09T08:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mateusrp	Did you check that the xsever wasn't upgraded? ( look at /var/log/dpkg.log )
2009-10-09T08:54:00.000Z	mateusrp	Jordan_U	yeah, looks like it upgraded xserver-xorg-core
2009-10-09T08:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mateusrp	Try downgrading xserver-xorg-core to the version that corrosponds to the xserver-xorg-video-intel package you downgraded
2009-10-09T08:58:00.000Z	mateusrp	Jordan_U	I can't... In order to get X working, I have to use the 2.4 (not the oficial 2.6, shipped with jaunty) of the intel driver, which requires a PPA repository...
2009-10-09T09:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mateusrp	Ahh, I thought you meant you downgraded to the previous minor release. Much of the intel regression has been fixed with newer intel drivers. You might try using the X updates PPA
2009-10-09T09:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mateusrp	But I don't recommend the crack pushers PPA
2009-10-09T09:02:00.000Z	mateusrp	Jordan_U	yeah, I know... but I'm running out of options here LOL I was hoping this was some known recent problem that wasn't on the forums yet
2009-10-09T09:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mateusrp	What version of the intel driver are you currently using?
2009-10-09T09:03:00.000Z	mateusrp	Jordan_U	2.4
2009-10-09T09:03:00.000Z	mateusrp	Jordan_U	I'll try the PPA "bleeding edge" 2.7.1 now
2009-10-09T09:03:00.000Z	mateusrp	Jordan_U	jaunty is shipped with 2.6
2009-10-09T09:05:00.000Z	mateusrp	Jordan_U	oops, 2.9
