2006-07-14T09:22:00.000Z	DarkElf109		Just search in the forums for it...there's a guide with somewhere between 70 and 150 pages...that's the one I followed, word for word
2006-07-14T09:22:00.000Z	DarkElf109		No idea how it relates. Just takes its place, somehow
2006-07-14T09:23:00.000Z	DarkElf109		Oh, well, now I'm informed =)

2006-07-14T09:24:00.000Z	DarkElf109		Oh, and use the quinn versions, not vanilla. Lots of optimizations
2006-07-14T09:24:00.000Z	DarkElf109		Eh, no problem. I was as surprised as you were when it worked =P
2006-07-14T09:26:00.000Z	DarkElf109		Probably because it relies on pixel shaders, but, hen again, I haven't peeked at the code, so, just a guess
2006-07-14T09:26:00.000Z	DarkElf109		then*
2006-07-14T09:26:00.000Z	DarkElf109		Bah...can't type tonight
2006-07-14T09:26:00.000Z	DBO	DarkElf109	Water does use pixel shaders
2006-07-14T09:26:00.000Z	DBO	DarkElf109	also the new frag and copacity plugins (not even in quinn yet) use pixel shaders
2006-07-14T09:27:00.000Z	DarkElf109	DBO	Explains why they're not in quinn yet
2006-07-14T09:27:00.000Z	DBO	DarkElf109	they are not in quinn because they are not stable yet, quinn is not opposed to pixel shaders
2006-07-14T09:28:00.000Z	DarkElf109	DBO	Oh, well, ok then...I've not read much on his philosophies, but it seemed to me to be a viable reason not to include them.
2006-07-14T09:29:00.000Z	DBO	DarkElf109	quinn is a she =P  And the pixel shaders will be required for more advanced plugins, somethings like blur will need them
2006-07-14T09:30:00.000Z	DarkElf109	DBO	Well, see? I'm totally uninformed, and now, fairly certain that my advances into the realm of OpenGL rendering on my desktop are at a stand-still
2006-07-14T09:30:00.000Z	DBO	DarkElf109	no, compiz does recognize many users do not have pixel shaders, and furthermore lots of effects simply dont call for them
2006-07-14T09:32:00.000Z	DarkElf109	DBO	True, but at this point, from what I've seen, the modules are moving closer to the gimmicky side than the usability side. The cube setup, if anything, finally got me to use virtual desktops effectively
2006-07-14T09:32:00.000Z	DarkElf109	DBO	Even if the newer ones can run on my system, I'm not even sure if I want to run them =P
2006-07-14T09:33:00.000Z	DBO	DarkElf109	some of them are, but a lot of them are moving towards useful things like blurred transparency.  You have to move in baby steps with this kind of thing
2006-07-14T09:33:00.000Z	DarkElf109	DBO	Well, I'll see how it progresses...In the meantime, I'll spend another half hour a day playign with the wobbly windows
