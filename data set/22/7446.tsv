2009-06-16T23:16:00.000Z	gabbah		'ello. I want to identify which device name my usb memory stick has (well it's actually an mp3 player)... i want to format it to fat32, but don't know which device it is
2009-06-16T23:16:00.000Z	ectospasm	gabbah	look at the output of dmesg
2009-06-16T23:17:00.000Z	gabbah	ectospasm	where should it say that? it just wants to open the folder.....
2009-06-16T23:17:00.000Z	ectospasm	gabbah	use the terminal
2009-06-16T23:18:00.000Z	gabbah	ectospasm	oh you mean i should use dmesg before pluging it in?
2009-06-16T23:18:00.000Z	ectospasm	gabbah	no
2009-06-16T23:18:00.000Z	ectospasm	gabbah	if Ubuntu automatically mounts it (it's available in Nautilus), you can use the mount command to see what device it mounted on /media/disk (or wherever)
2009-06-16T23:20:00.000Z	gabbah	ectospasm	i don't think it's listing it.... maybe it's because the current file system is "gphoto"?
2009-06-16T23:20:00.000Z	ectospasm	gabbah	use the terminal
2009-06-16T23:21:00.000Z	gabbah	ectospasm	i did. i wrote "mount"
2009-06-16T23:21:00.000Z	ectospasm	gabbah	if it's mounted, it will show there.  If it's not, then you'll have to use dmesg from the terminal
2009-06-16T23:21:00.000Z	gabbah	ectospasm	nautilus give it a nice big label... my other drives are listed when i use the mount command... but i don't see the usb
2009-06-16T23:21:00.000Z	gabbah	ectospasm	well. it's mounted because i can see the files in it
2009-06-16T23:22:00.000Z	gabbah	ectospasm	i just don't know WHICH one it is in the mount command
2009-06-16T23:22:00.000Z	ectospasm	gabbah	is /media/whatever listed in mount?
2009-06-16T23:22:00.000Z	gabbah	ectospasm	media/disk1 and disk2 are listed yes
2009-06-16T23:22:00.000Z	gabbah	ectospasm	but not my mp3 player
2009-06-16T23:23:00.000Z	ectospasm	gabbah	how do you know?  Can you "cd /media/disk{1,2}" and see your mp3 files?
2009-06-16T23:23:00.000Z	gabbah	ectospasm	no, those under media are my other drives..i know their labels
2009-06-16T23:25:00.000Z	ectospasm	gabbah	so it's not mounted, use dmesg
2009-06-16T23:26:00.000Z	gabbah	ectospasm	the label is "SanDisk Corp. SanDisk Sansa m240"
2009-06-16T23:26:00.000Z	ectospasm	gabbah	that doesn't mean much
