2010-06-14T07:16:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Roasted	of course it depends on what you're wanting it for, but I was just messing w/ ebox and it pretty much handles all setup and config for you
2010-06-14T07:17:00.000Z	Roasted	ubuntu_	does webmin do that? I have webmin installed...
2010-06-14T07:17:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Roasted	that note just posted re: Webmin is why I was playing w/ ebox
2010-06-14T07:18:00.000Z	Roasted	ubuntu_	I'm looking at ebox now. there's quite a few in software center. is there a "download ebox" and get all of the above option?
2010-06-14T07:19:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Roasted	I understand webmin is popular w/ its adherents, but I think it only works on older versions of Ubuntu, (maybe 8.04???)
2010-06-14T07:20:00.000Z	Roasted	ubuntu_	works terrific on 10.04. I've had zero issues and use it extensively on production servers at work.
2010-06-14T07:20:00.000Z	Roasted	ubuntu_	what does "not supported" mean? It's in the software center... *shrug*
2010-06-14T07:20:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Roasted	interesting.
2010-06-14T07:21:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Roasted	well the note says it has an incompatible way of handling packages.
2010-06-14T07:33:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Roasted	 If its like ebox (never used it) you log into it by giving the https://<ip address of the machine>/ebox
2010-06-14T07:34:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Roasted	the medibuntu site includes non-free software.
2010-06-14T07:54:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Roasted	I get the login by https://<ipnumber>/ebox in my browser
2010-06-14T07:56:00.000Z	Roasted	ubuntu_	thanks. I think I forgot something. I selected ebox common or w/e in software ctr thinking it'd grab everything, but it didnt. I forgot you need to either install individually or apt-get ebox-* or whatever t download ebox + all ebox modules. doing that now
2010-06-14T08:01:00.000Z	Roasted	ubuntu_	the curve ball was the S - need https not http. :P
2010-06-14T08:05:00.000Z	Roasted	ubuntu_	is there a lamp module for ebox?
2010-06-14T08:05:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Roasted	yeah, the 's' fooled me at first too.
2010-06-14T08:06:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Roasted	well under the covers the web server is Apache (the A)
2010-06-14T08:07:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Roasted	lets see, remind me the other L, M,P are again?
2010-06-14T08:07:00.000Z	Roasted	ubuntu_	I have no idea - I just told my buddy I wanted to share out files FTP-style but not FTP and he said use LAMP.
2010-06-14T08:08:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Roasted	hmmm... I wonder if they meant http or something.  I know ebox provides file sharing AND ftp (distinguishes between).
2010-06-14T08:09:00.000Z	Roasted	ubuntu_	also, do you know if ebox can suck up the current samba setup? I have samba set up here and ebox isnt detecting my shares/users/etc.
2010-06-14T08:22:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Roasted	great question.  Sorry I don't know.  Just started playing w/ it myself.
