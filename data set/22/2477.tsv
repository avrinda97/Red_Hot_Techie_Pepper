2009-06-12T08:54:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper		lol wow i just reply'd myself :p
2009-06-12T08:56:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper		wow lol i just got that :)
2009-06-12T08:58:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper		it may tell of your chipset
2009-06-12T08:59:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper		!hello
2009-06-12T08:59:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper		:)
2009-06-12T08:59:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper		man... i love this bot already, it helps me do everything i'm too lazy to do
2009-06-12T09:00:00.000Z	darlek	Dev_u_pper	yes I like it too... send it to yourself though with !ubottu | Dev_u_pper then you can !find and !search etc
2009-06-12T10:41:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	darlek	ubuntu uses ath5k by default
2009-06-12T10:42:00.000Z	darlek	Dev_u_pper	correct.  I had it working but I went to madwifi for greater range and usability, frankly the ath5k isn't ready for prime time for a lot of cards
2009-06-12T10:49:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	darlek	:we cannot infer that miguel1057 even uses a wireless card with an atheros chipset.  We need to know what card he has first.  For all we know, he may have a new intel card.
2009-06-12T10:55:00.000Z	darlek	Dev_u_pper	miguel1057 is you use lshw, it will probably show the card as Not Assigned or something like that.  Thus showing if the card is in fact enabled.
2009-06-12T11:02:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	darlek	: aww... we almost had it :)
2009-06-12T11:02:00.000Z	darlek	Dev_u_pper	I think I was closer!!
2009-06-12T11:03:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	darlek	: i was thinking he may have had a broadcom driver with a buggy antennae power control... it happens sometimes with newer cards
2009-06-12T11:03:00.000Z	darlek	Dev_u_pper	... ;)
2009-06-12T11:04:00.000Z	darlek	Dev_u_pper	I see.  I was thinking how ath5k hates my orinoco proxim card since Ibex and how I finangled madwifi to restore it back to a fully functional card
2009-06-12T11:04:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	darlek	yes, madwifi sometimes covers ath5k ... it is still in its ' infancy in 2.6.27
2009-06-12T11:05:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	darlek	forgive me, baslphemy... i have used ubuntu's name in vain... 2.6.28 :P
2009-06-12T11:05:00.000Z	darlek	Dev_u_pper	ndiswrapper an option of course for vista drivers.  Ath5k is obviously the future, but it's not quite up to the support level of madwifi ...  oh man .27 I hated... I even tried my own custom kernel but madwifi saved me ;)
2009-06-12T11:06:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	darlek	: well, i cannot say that i have parteken completely, I use gentoo to support/develop for all other platforms ... it makes dealing with the interdependencies and awkward version control actually manageable ;)
2009-06-12T11:09:00.000Z	darlek	Dev_u_pper	well, at least you're familiar with drivers and compiling
