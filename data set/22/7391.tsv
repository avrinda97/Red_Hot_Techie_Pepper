2006-05-03T15:12:00.000Z	david324132		Hey. Does anyone know how to use the "xmacrorec" command?
2006-05-03T15:13:00.000Z	david324132		Just an example call will do
2006-05-03T15:13:00.000Z	_jason	david324132	I've used it, now remembering how is a different story.  Let me play with it
2006-05-03T15:14:00.000Z	david324132	_jason	Thanks. I just have no clue what the "remote_display" argument is ^^
2006-05-03T15:15:00.000Z	_jason	david324132	xmacrorec :0.0, that's usually the right display to use.
2006-05-03T15:16:00.000Z	david324132	_jason	My mouse disappears -_-. haha
2006-05-03T15:17:00.000Z	david324132	_jason	I have a stupid question for you. How can I register for Freenode?
2006-05-03T15:18:00.000Z	_jason	david324132	seems just xmacrorec :0, works too
2006-05-03T15:18:00.000Z	david324132	_jason	Thanks
2006-05-03T15:18:00.000Z	_jason	david324132	do you know what xmacrorec2 is for?
2006-05-03T15:19:00.000Z	david324132	_jason	Nope. I've never even heard of it
2006-05-03T15:21:00.000Z	david324132	_jason	Does your mouse disappear as well when you run xmacrorec?
2006-05-03T15:22:00.000Z	_jason	david324132	yeah, hmm didn't used to do that.  Are you running breezy?
2006-05-03T15:23:00.000Z	_jason	david324132	you mean xmacrorec right?
2006-05-03T15:23:00.000Z	david324132	_jason	Yeah, I'm using Breezy.
2006-05-03T15:23:00.000Z	david324132	_jason	Yeah, xmacrorec
2006-05-03T15:24:00.000Z	david324132	_jason	Do you suggest compiling from the src on xmacrorec.sf.net?
2006-05-03T15:24:00.000Z	_jason	david324132	yes, my mouse disappears.  I think it's find
2006-05-03T15:24:00.000Z	david324132	_jason	i mean xmacro.sf.net, haha. ok
2006-05-03T15:24:00.000Z	_jason	david324132	I haven't tried it, but it shouldn't be too difficult
2006-05-03T15:25:00.000Z	david324132	_jason	I'll probably just not worry about it. It was just for the sake of being lazy anyway
2006-05-03T15:26:00.000Z	_jason	david324132	only time I used it was to setup some stuff in xbindkeys, so that never got in the way
