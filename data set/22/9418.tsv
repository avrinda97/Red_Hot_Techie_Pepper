2005-03-29T09:39:00.000Z	ohgood	electricwheels	yes, it should
2005-03-29T09:40:00.000Z	ohgood	electricwheels	you need to make sure it's pointing to the correct partition, also.
2005-03-29T09:40:00.000Z	ohgood	electricwheels	that would be harddrive 0, partition 1
2005-03-29T09:42:00.000Z	ohgood	electricwheels	as root, do: fdisk -l           and see if you are pointing to the correct partition
2005-03-29T09:43:00.000Z	ohgood	electricwheels	so you want your xp partition, that is /dev/hda1, right ?
2005-03-29T09:45:00.000Z	ohgood	electricwheels	ok, so i'll message you a typical setup...
