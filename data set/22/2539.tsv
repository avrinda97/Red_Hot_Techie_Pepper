2009-05-17T22:14:00.000Z	DaveJ1337		howdy
2009-05-17T22:15:00.000Z	DaveJ1337		anyone know how to force a display size Jaunty?
2009-05-17T22:15:00.000Z	jmburgess	DaveJ1337	what do you mean?
2009-05-17T22:15:00.000Z	DaveJ1337		well, I've got my display running to a 46inch TV and Ubuntu sees it as a 37"
2009-05-17T22:16:00.000Z	DaveJ1337		the top, bottom, left and right are cut off
2009-05-17T22:16:00.000Z	DaveJ1337		desktop too big for screen
2009-05-17T22:16:00.000Z	DaveJ1337		seems like it should be an easy fix
2009-05-17T22:18:00.000Z	jmburgess	DaveJ1337	i think it is just a quick edit in your xorg.conf
2009-05-17T22:19:00.000Z	DaveJ1337	jmburgess	I thought so too, but jaunty's xorg.conf file is empty
2009-05-17T22:19:00.000Z	jmburgess	DaveJ1337	ugh your right, xorg is weird in jaunty
2009-05-17T22:19:00.000Z	jmburgess	DaveJ1337	lemme look
2009-05-17T22:19:00.000Z	DaveJ1337		ok jmburg, thx.  I really just need to know where the new "xorg" type file is I guess
2009-05-17T22:23:00.000Z	jmburgess	DaveJ1337	so I have stuff in my xorg conf
2009-05-17T22:23:00.000Z	jmburgess	DaveJ1337	are you looking at /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2009-05-17T22:23:00.000Z	DaveJ1337		oh yeah jmburg?   mine's generic with no real entries
2009-05-17T22:23:00.000Z	DaveJ1337		just an autogenerated file
2009-05-17T22:24:00.000Z	jmburgess	DaveJ1337	oh mine is real because I use nvidia-settings
2009-05-17T22:24:00.000Z	DaveJ1337		I wonder if I put an entry in there if it will override whatever else Jaunty's using...
2009-05-17T22:24:00.000Z	jmburgess	DaveJ1337	yeah it should
2009-05-17T22:24:00.000Z	DaveJ1337		ah, gotcha.  I'm using ATI.
2009-05-17T22:24:00.000Z	DaveJ1337		I'll give it a shot
2009-05-17T22:24:00.000Z	jmburgess	DaveJ1337	that is how I used to do it on older ubuntus
