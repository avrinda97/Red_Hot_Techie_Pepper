2008-02-10T12:21:00.000Z	sp219		Does anyone know of a way to log out another user, so I can use the 'deluser' function?
2008-02-10T12:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sp219	 kill all the users processes
2008-02-16T06:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sp219	 Somthing seemed odd about the way you prased that.. X starts a X server.. Unless of course you are using vnc.
2008-02-16T06:27:00.000Z	sp219	Dr_willis	basically, i want a command that will start a brand new xfce session.
2008-02-16T06:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sp219	  start it where?  a new desktop?
2008-02-16T06:27:00.000Z	sp219	Dr_willis	(Without using the graphical login screen -- just from a command line)
2008-02-16T06:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sp219	 you want to spawn a new X session that runs xfce, on  a new tty? so alt-ctrl-F8 gets to the new session?
2008-02-16T06:28:00.000Z	sp219	Dr_willis	? I currently have no GUI running. I want to start xfce, instead of gnome which launces with startx
2008-02-16T06:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sp219	 You can make a .xinitrc that will launch whatever you want. :)
2008-02-16T06:28:00.000Z	sp219	Dr_willis	yes. A new X session that has xfce
2008-02-16T06:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sp219	 i forget what  starts XFCE desktop however.
2008-02-16T06:29:00.000Z	sp219	Dr_willis	how do i do that
2008-02-16T06:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sp219	 that will make startx, just run xfce.
2008-02-16T06:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sp219	 make a file named .xinitrc  put whatever commands ya want in it.
2008-02-16T06:30:00.000Z	sp219	Dr_willis	wait, what file do i put the commands in?
2008-02-16T06:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sp219	 each user CAN have a .xinitrc file in their home dir. If its there then 'startx' runs whats in that file. Not the system wide defaults
2008-02-16T06:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sp219	 example .xinitrc file (2 lines)   xterm &    exec gnome-session
2008-02-16T06:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sp219	jwm
2008-02-16T06:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sp219	 bettetr to ask what your NEEDS are
2008-02-16T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sp219	  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-02-16T06:51:00.000Z	sp219	Dr_willis	i can't just change the screen resolution for one particular session without having to reconfigure X?
2008-02-16T06:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sp219	 gnome/kde have some xrandr tools/features that can let the user change their res. If its enabled properly
