2005-09-30T05:27:00.000Z	dooglus	bachler	it takes 30 seconds for me!
2005-09-30T06:19:00.000Z	dooglus	bachler	would you try this for me please, re. the screenshot program being slow?
2005-09-30T06:19:00.000Z	dooglus	bachler	in nautilus, make a new bookmark to "smb://abc123/abc123/abc123".  then try running screenshot.  does it take 15 seconds to start up now?
2005-09-30T06:20:00.000Z	bachler	dooglus	nope.. it is as fast as ever
2005-09-30T06:21:00.000Z	dooglus	bachler	strange.
2005-09-30T06:21:00.000Z	bachler	dooglus	very.
2005-09-30T06:21:00.000Z	dooglus	bachler	what did the bookmark get called?
2005-09-30T06:22:00.000Z	bachler	dooglus	it dint work to make a bookmark to "smb://abc123/abc123/abc123".. or how to u mean? places>connect to server..?
2005-09-30T06:25:00.000Z	dooglus	bachler	I mean: click the 'places' menu at the top of the screen.  select "computer".  in the new window, click the 'bookmarks' menu, then 'add bookmark'.  then click the 'bookmarks' menu again and 'edit bookmarks'.  then click the 'computer' bookmark and edit the location to be "smb://abc123/abc123/abc123".
2005-09-30T06:27:00.000Z	bachler	dooglus	oh,, then it is called, "abc123 on abc123"
2005-09-30T06:28:00.000Z	dooglus	bachler	ok.  and now - is the program slow starting up if you gnome-screenshot ?
