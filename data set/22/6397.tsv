2006-11-09T12:11:00.000Z	infernaljesus		how do I connect to a WPA-TKIP wireless network?
2006-11-09T12:12:00.000Z	infernaljesus		I have installed gnome- network manager and wpa supplicant
2006-11-09T12:12:00.000Z	infernaljesus		but I still don't see an option for WPA
2006-11-09T12:12:00.000Z	osfameron	infernaljesus	gnome-network-manager didn't do anything useful for me until I rebooted and unplugged from the wired lan connection
2006-11-09T12:13:00.000Z	infernaljesus	osfameron	so I reboot and unplug myself and it will work?
2006-11-09T12:13:00.000Z	infernaljesus		osmaferon, well... it's worth a shot...
2006-11-09T12:19:00.000Z	osfameron	infernaljesus	any joy?
2006-11-09T12:20:00.000Z	infernaljesus	osfameron	unfortunately not :(
2006-11-09T12:20:00.000Z	osfameron	infernaljesus	there should be a little icon in the taskbar which has a "just do what I mean" action on clicking on it
2006-11-09T12:20:00.000Z	osfameron	infernaljesus	I got quite bad tempered about it while I still had a wired connection.  The moment I removed that, it decided to actually do something useful.
2006-11-09T12:21:00.000Z	infernaljesus	osfameron	I see the conenction icon (if that's what you're talking about) and I click it and I can choose wired or wireless. But when I choose wireless I can only type WEP keys, not WPA
2006-11-09T12:21:00.000Z	infernaljesus		*connection
2006-11-09T12:21:00.000Z	osfameron	infernaljesus	I'm getting the impression that ubuntu laptop networking might be working (as in, as well as XP if not Mac) by Feisty or whatever the next version is called...
2006-11-09T12:21:00.000Z	osfameron	infernaljesus	for me it correctly identified that my dad's connection was protected by WPA and Did The Right Thing
2006-11-09T12:22:00.000Z	osfameron	infernaljesus	whereas at home it just got me onto my (unprotected, yeah yeah, I suck) network without asking me any questions
2006-11-09T12:22:00.000Z	infernaljesus	osfameron	I installed wpa_supplicant, but all it has in the /etc/wpa_supplicant/ is ifupdown.sh
2006-11-09T12:22:00.000Z	infernaljesus	osfameron	shouldn't there be a .conf?
2006-11-09T12:22:00.000Z	osfameron	infernaljesus	yeah, me too.  I couldn't make head nor tail of it
2006-11-09T12:23:00.000Z	osfameron	infernaljesus	are you on Edgy?  I think wpa_supplicant was preinstalled, so perhaps you're not
2006-11-09T12:23:00.000Z	infernaljesus	osfameron	yes, UI'm on edgy
2006-11-09T12:23:00.000Z	osfameron	infernaljesus	oh well.  Like I said... maybe it'll be functional in Feisty... *maybe*
2006-11-09T12:27:00.000Z	infernaljesus	osfameron	do you know of any other wifi managers?
