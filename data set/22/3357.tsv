2008-09-30T05:31:00.000Z	consolover	pibe86	I was expecting some link from the ubottu to upgrade. Beware with intrepid. I had to downgrade back to 8.04 'cos it was not working for me. And downgrade means, clean install

2008-09-30T05:33:00.000Z	consolover	pibe86	you need to run "gksudo update-manager -d"
2008-09-30T05:33:00.000Z	consolover	pibe86	a button should appear there saying that 8.10 is available. Look for it
2008-09-30T05:34:00.000Z	pibe86	consolover	not, there is not button
2008-09-30T05:34:00.000Z	consolover	pibe86	also, make sure, you have everything up to date before doing that and some sort of knowledge that you allow to you to make your PC working from a tty
