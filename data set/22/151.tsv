2012-05-20T05:51:00.000Z	sirdeiu	tynach	you could also  just copy and modify a .desktop entry file from /usr/share/applications,  where they are kept.
2012-05-20T05:53:00.000Z	tynach	sirdeiu	that's what I did originally. But they all have a lot of Gnome-specific things in the .desktop file that I didn't know what to do with, and I didn't want any of that in mine.
2012-05-20T05:55:00.000Z	sirdeiu	tynach	depending on what you want your launcher to do, you'll need more or less some entries. Type, Name, Exec, Path, Icon are the basic needed one(s).
2012-05-20T05:56:00.000Z	tynach	sirdeiu	I gathered, but what about things like... *checks* "X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Component=general"
2012-05-20T05:56:00.000Z	sirdeiu	tynach	you don't need that to launch Minecraft :)
2012-05-20T05:58:00.000Z	tynach	sirdeiu	I know, but there's like... 20 different lines like that, and there are several that contain 'gedit' as the value, making me unsure which one's actually the one to edit for launching. Basically, I like to have a new one created so I know everything I need is in there, and not more. I need to learn to write them by hand.
2012-05-20T05:59:00.000Z	sirdeiu	tynach	like I said, Type, Name, Icon, Exec, Path are what you need.
2012-05-20T06:00:00.000Z	tynach	sirdeiu	what about the fact that the generated one from that command, does not have a 'path' in it?
2012-05-20T06:00:00.000Z	sirdeiu	tynach	of those Exec=/path/to/minecraft/launch, path=/path/to/minecraft, Icon=/path/to/minecraft.png or copy minecraft.png to ~/.icons and specify Icon=minecraft.png only and Name=Minecraft
2012-05-20T06:01:00.000Z	sirdeiu	tynach	what command ?
2012-05-20T06:01:00.000Z	tynach		The one trism provided.
2012-05-20T06:01:00.000Z	tynach		gnome-desktop-item-edit
2012-05-20T06:02:00.000Z	sirdeiu	tynach	see here http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/  .desktop entry specification and http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/apa.html
2012-05-20T06:02:00.000Z	sirdeiu		example file
2012-05-20T06:03:00.000Z	tynach	sirdeiu	why is it that in mine, it duplicates some lines like: "Name[en_US]=Minecraft", and one without the [en_US]? Can I safely delete the duplicates?
2012-05-20T06:04:00.000Z	sirdeiu	tynach	yes, Name[en_US] or Name[de_DE] are just localized to different languages.
2012-05-20T06:04:00.000Z	sirdeiu	tynach	 you can use only Name=
2012-05-20T06:05:00.000Z	sirdeiu	tynach	that is if you are using English as your language.
2012-05-20T06:05:00.000Z	tynach	sirdeiu	I am. Deleted the [en_US] ones.
2012-05-20T06:12:00.000Z	sirdeiu	tynach	here's an interesting one: http://www.liberiangeek.net/2012/04/add-application-shortcuts-to-your-desktop-in-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin/
2012-05-20T06:18:00.000Z	tynach	sirdeiu	that's actually how I messed with gedit's originally. I already knew about that. But I wanted a custom one for Minecraft.
