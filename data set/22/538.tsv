2011-08-02T05:14:00.000Z	ratkinson	dr_willis	normal desktop and the browser
2011-08-02T05:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	ratkinson	 you could make a custome x session for that.
2011-08-02T05:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	ratkinson	 there may be some koisk howtos out for chromiom or some extenstions also
2011-08-02T05:10:00.000Z	ratkinson	dr_willis	i have penmount touchscreen drivers loading in my current (default) session will it effect that?
2011-08-02T05:10:00.000Z	ratkinson	dr_willis	if i run chromium-browser --kiosk in a terminal it does exactly what i want it to do
2011-08-02T05:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	ratkinson	 depends on how they are getting loaded.  you can make a .xinitrc to run exactly what you tell it to
2011-08-02T05:12:00.000Z	ratkinson	dr_willis	all i want to run after ubuntu 11.04 loads is bash sleep 30; "chromium-browser --kiosk"
2011-08-02T05:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	ratkinson	 you mean after x starts.. you can make a custome x session to do that
2011-08-02T05:13:00.000Z	ratkinson	dr_willis	i cnt just add it to a script that already runs in the current x?
2011-08-02T05:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	ratkinson	 you want just the browser? or a normal desktop.and the browser..
2011-08-02T05:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	ratkinson	 so use the autorun dir. and make a simple 2 line script.
2011-08-02T05:15:00.000Z	ratkinson	dr_willis	can i add a bash command to the end of and currently running scripts?
2011-08-02T05:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	ratkinson	you are using gnome?
2011-08-02T05:16:00.000Z	ratkinson	dr_willis	ok :) wheres the auto run dir? I'm using a fresh clean install of ubuntu 11.04
2011-08-02T05:16:00.000Z	ratkinson	dr_willis	so yes i am using gnome
2011-08-02T05:20:00.000Z	ratkinson	dr_willis	how would i get to the .config/autostart location from terminal
2011-08-02T05:20:00.000Z	ratkinson	dr_willis	i tried cd /.config
2011-08-02T05:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	ratkinson	 via cd command.. you may want to spend an hr learning shell basics
2011-08-02T05:23:00.000Z	ratkinson	dr_willis	so once im in .config/autostart/ i can just create a .sh file in there and make it exe?
