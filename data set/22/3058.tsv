2008-12-19T08:56:00.000Z	oinker	raylu	thankyou.  i'v now got the main screen u get when one logs in, but now i have a "failed to initialze HAL" error
2008-12-19T08:57:00.000Z	raylu	oinker	anything more specific than that?
2008-12-19T08:58:00.000Z	oinker	raylu	nope, just the home screen with a box with that error, and a frozen mouse. aly-f2 takes me to a terminal looking page asking for login details
2008-12-19T09:00:00.000Z	oinker	raylu	i can log in. is there a cmd i can run to diagnose/fix
2008-12-19T09:00:00.000Z	raylu	oinker	are you looking at a tty or gnome?
2008-12-19T09:02:00.000Z	oinker	raylu	tty2
2008-12-19T09:03:00.000Z	raylu	oinker	did you boot as rescue mode?
2008-12-19T09:03:00.000Z	raylu	oinker	if not, "sudo dmesg | tail" may help
2008-12-19T09:03:00.000Z	oinker	raylu	no, & ok
2008-12-19T09:04:00.000Z	oinker	raylu	what in the output is of help, the only stand out seems to be "No VRS found"
2008-12-19T09:05:00.000Z	raylu	oinker	might want to look back more than 10 lines, then
2008-12-19T09:05:00.000Z	oinker	raylu	it actually only gives me exactly 10 lines
2008-12-19T09:06:00.000Z	raylu	oinker	right. there's a tail option to get more
2008-12-19T09:06:00.000Z	raylu	oinker	i think it's -n, though i'm not sure
