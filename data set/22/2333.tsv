2009-07-14T00:26:00.000Z	guntbert	flaviosnm	are you certain that your CD is not defect - maybe the iso image wasn't ok, did you check it?
2009-07-14T00:28:00.000Z	flaviosnm	guntbert	and i have installed in others pcs
2009-07-14T00:29:00.000Z	guntbert	flaviosnm	I see, but I've never heard of error 5...
2009-07-14T00:31:00.000Z	flaviosnm	guntbert	i already have heard about it and i know exit a way to repair but i don't know how
2009-07-14T00:35:00.000Z	guntbert	flaviosnm	how much ram do you have?
2009-07-14T00:36:00.000Z	flaviosnm	guntbert	512MB in one and 1024MB in another one
2009-07-14T00:38:00.000Z	guntbert	flaviosnm	should be enough... - so back to step 1: at what point in the install do you get that error? did you answer the questions already? (what Harddisk to use and so on)
2009-07-14T00:41:00.000Z	flaviosnm	guntbert	this error occur after last step and when the installation reach 24% the message error pop up and i have to reboot the machine
2009-07-14T00:41:00.000Z	flaviosnm	guntbert	even using wubi the error appear
2009-07-14T00:42:00.000Z	guntbert	flaviosnm	I'm really fishing here - is there enough space on the disk?
2009-07-14T00:50:00.000Z	flaviosnm	guntbert	i tried create a partion and use the complete disk too and install inside windows trough wubi
2009-07-14T00:44:00.000Z	flaviosnm	guntbert	yes, there is space enough. The curious is that i already use the same cd to install in others pc with sucess!
2009-07-14T00:46:00.000Z	guntbert	flaviosnm	I'm looking for the fault on the PCs not on CD - thats why I asked about disk space
2009-07-14T00:47:00.000Z	flaviosnm	guntbert	 I understood! the disk has 80GB and 120GB
2009-07-14T00:48:00.000Z	guntbert	flaviosnm	still fishing: did you give the complete disk to ubuntu?
2009-07-14T00:51:00.000Z	flaviosnm	guntbert	but anyone of those option working good
2009-07-14T00:51:00.000Z	guntbert	flaviosnm	I don't know about wubi, did you run the "check CD" from the start menu?
2009-07-14T00:53:00.000Z	flaviosnm	guntbert	sure! and it is ok.
2009-07-14T00:53:00.000Z	flaviosnm	guntbert	 ok my friend! thank you for a while, i need to go now
2009-07-14T00:54:00.000Z	flaviosnm	guntbert	 i will try one more time.
2009-07-14T00:54:00.000Z	guntbert	flaviosnm	hmm, I just wanted to say that I'm at the end of ideas - good luck to you
2009-07-14T00:55:00.000Z	flaviosnm	guntbert	ok don't worry :)
