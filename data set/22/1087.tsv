2011-01-19T07:45:00.000Z	rvn		during the install process for 10.10 on my aspire one d250, the internet worked fine via wireless wpa2. now that it is installed, it attempts to connect and then prompts me for a key again - it will not connect.
2011-01-19T07:45:00.000Z	rvn		(atheros chipset, too..)
2011-01-19T07:45:00.000Z	KM0201	rvn	which atheros chipset?
2011-01-19T07:45:00.000Z	rvn	KM0201	fantastic question, i'll do an lspci
2011-01-19T07:48:00.000Z	KM0201	rvn	i red another post (from dec 31) that described a similar problem, and they suggested madwifi
2011-01-19T07:48:00.000Z	rvn	KM0201	-^
2011-01-19T07:48:00.000Z	rvn	KM0201	but it worked before installation
2011-01-19T07:49:00.000Z	rvn	KM0201	leads me to believe perhaps an upgraded package broke it
2011-01-19T07:49:00.000Z	KM0201	rvn	hmm.. i really don't know...
2011-01-19T08:19:00.000Z	rvn	KM0201	i learned with SuSE (long before ubuntu existed) myself, but i'd think linux mint is a bit easier to nubs than ubuntu itself
2011-01-19T08:19:00.000Z	rvn	KM0201	depending on whether you're using it as your daily system
2011-01-19T08:20:00.000Z	rvn	KM0201	while learning
2011-01-19T08:20:00.000Z	KM0201	rvn	i'm not a huge fan of Mint, but i really fail to see hiow it's any easier than Ubuntu... it's more or less the same thing, just a different GUI.
2011-01-19T08:21:00.000Z	rvn	KM0201	no it includes a multitude of applications and packages for various tasks, including non-free, to make the transition a bit easier from windows to linux for daily use without knowing how to rectify things yourself
2011-01-19T08:21:00.000Z	rvn	KM0201	ex. official ATI/NVIDIA drivers and flash are at your fingertips, etc.
2011-01-19T08:22:00.000Z	KM0201	rvn	i dunno, flash takes 30sec to install on ubuntu, and Nvidia drivers... i just use the restricted driver, and its no problem.
2011-01-19T08:22:00.000Z	rvn	KM0201	if you're technical already it's not a big difference, but if you're a total noob, it can help
2011-01-19T08:22:00.000Z	rvn	KM0201	someone like me, and from what i understand you, wouldnt take much effort to adjust
2011-01-19T08:22:00.000Z	rvn	KM0201	but someone who can barely install crap on windows might find it much easier
2011-01-19T08:22:00.000Z	KM0201	rvn	right
2011-01-19T08:24:00.000Z	rvn	KM0201	for the record, after hooking up wired ethernet and doing a software update it fixed my wifi connecting problem - just in case you run into that with someone else
2011-01-19T08:24:00.000Z	rvn	KM0201	im out of here now, bai
