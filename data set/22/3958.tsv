2008-06-03T01:40:00.000Z	ariqs		well aren't you special
2008-06-03T01:40:00.000Z	cygoku	ariqs	my ati radeon 9800 pro works fine
2008-06-03T01:40:00.000Z	ariqs	cygoku	what drivers do you use?
2008-06-03T01:41:00.000Z	ariqs	cygoku	and what do you mean by fine. Mine work fine for regular desktop stuff with the packaged restricted drivers, but they don't work for opengl worth a crap
2008-06-03T01:41:00.000Z	cygoku	ariqs	: the open source or the propriatary works good
2008-06-03T01:44:00.000Z	cygoku	ariqs	: What do you need ?
2008-06-03T01:46:00.000Z	cygoku	ariqs	: Try to install the propriatary driver using Envy, get from the repo.
2008-06-03T01:46:00.000Z	ariqs	cygoku	why will it be diff with envy?
2008-06-03T01:47:00.000Z	cygoku	ariqs	: Envy will do everything for, like restricting driver module and editing ZORG.conf correctly.
2008-06-03T05:42:00.000Z	cygoku	ariqs	still there ! did you fixed your stuff ?
2008-06-03T05:42:00.000Z	ariqs	cygoku	no, envy didn't work either. It made me get stuck in low res ;p
2008-06-03T05:43:00.000Z	cygoku	ariqs	that cannot be true as we have the same exact card
2008-06-03T05:43:00.000Z	ariqs	cygoku	I have a 9800 pro, it didn't work /shrug
