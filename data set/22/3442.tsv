2008-09-07T03:23:00.000Z	kevink23		thanks, i have it installed but fire fox still says i cant play videos
2008-09-07T03:24:00.000Z	kevink23		yep
2008-09-07T03:25:00.000Z	kevink23		does anyone else know what could be wrong with firefox? it says there is no flash player installed but it is
2008-09-07T03:25:00.000Z	tritium	kevink23	you installed flashplugin-nonfree?
2008-09-07T03:26:00.000Z	tritium	kevink23	the output of "apt-cache policy flashplugin-nonfree" verifies this?
2008-09-07T03:27:00.000Z	tritium	kevink23	I didn't tell you to use sed.  That
2008-09-07T03:29:00.000Z	kevink23	tritium	so do u know what else might be wrong
2008-09-07T03:30:00.000Z	tritium	kevink23	I doubt that any letter, including "u" knows a thing
2008-09-07T03:30:00.000Z	kevink23	tritium	well sorry
2008-09-07T03:31:00.000Z	tritium	kevink23	no, you can't be, if you're using flashplugin-nonfree
2008-09-07T03:33:00.000Z	tritium	kevink23	you never answered me how you installed flash.  Did you install the flashplugin-nonfree ubuntu package?
2008-09-07T03:34:00.000Z	tritium	kevink23	maybe you tried, as I see you keep responding to Tristam, instead of me.  What is your answer?
2008-09-07T03:35:00.000Z	kevink23	tritium	yeas sorry i was talkin to the wrong person, it is 9.0
2008-09-07T03:36:00.000Z	tritium	kevink23	from the ubuntu package?
2008-09-07T03:36:00.000Z	kevink23	tritium	yeah
2008-09-07T03:36:00.000Z	tritium	kevink23	it's likely the issue with sites that expect Flash 10, I suspect, then.
2008-09-07T03:37:00.000Z	kevink23	tritium	but it was workin yesterday
2008-09-07T03:37:00.000Z	tritium	kevink23	what has changed since then?  New package updates?  What?
2008-09-07T03:38:00.000Z	kevink23	tritium	nope, it just wasnt workin when i went onto youtube there
2008-09-07T03:38:00.000Z	tritium	kevink23	something had to have changed
2008-09-07T03:38:00.000Z	kevink23	tritium	well yeah lol
