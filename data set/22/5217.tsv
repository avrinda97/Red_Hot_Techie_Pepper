2007-06-25T05:06:00.000Z	Gerrit		I suppose the blue icon with the lock means "protected", but I also see an icon of a PC, and I don't know what that one means.
2007-06-25T05:07:00.000Z	Gerrit		I mean
2007-06-25T05:07:00.000Z	Gerrit		I find rpm better than deb
2007-06-25T05:08:00.000Z	Gerrit		But I find apt-get better than yum
2007-06-25T05:08:00.000Z	Gnea	Gerrit	you are horribly misled.
2007-06-25T05:08:00.000Z	Gerrit	Gnea	Debian package manager does not seem to register in the package database when the package was installed, and allows packets to asks question interactively. The latter is a horrible mistake, in my opinion.
2007-06-25T05:10:00.000Z	Gnea	Gerrit	a timestamp is not a good way to distinguish between package managers. debian provides a solidly robust system that rpm can't even compare to.
2007-06-25T05:10:00.000Z	Gerrit	Gnea	I find that RPM is a lot more robust and comprehensive.
2007-06-25T05:10:00.000Z	Gnea	Gerrit	how long have you used ubuntu?
2007-06-25T05:10:00.000Z	Gerrit	Gnea	For example, the RPM --qf option, queryformat, offers a lot more tags than Debian's equivalent.
2007-06-25T05:10:00.000Z	Gerrit	Gnea	Not long, but long enough to experience the limitations of the debian package manager.
2007-06-25T05:11:00.000Z	Gerrit	Gnea	Debian package manager has about 30 fields, I think.
2007-06-25T05:11:00.000Z	Gnea	Gerrit	that's quite a good load of FUD you're building
2007-06-25T05:11:00.000Z	Gerrit	Gnea	I'm not spreading FUD.
2007-06-25T05:11:00.000Z	Gerrit	Gnea	There is no Debian package manager equivalent of RPM's 'INSTALL-DATE'.
2007-06-25T05:11:00.000Z	Gnea	Gerrit	how long is 'not very long'?
2007-06-25T05:11:00.000Z	Gerrit	Gnea	ten days.
2007-06-25T05:12:00.000Z	Gnea	Gerrit	then that doesn't count. when you hit the 1 year mark, then we'll talk. :)
2007-06-25T05:15:00.000Z	Gnea	Gerrit	well, i think that you'll find, over time, that even though there's a lack of obvious timestamping, that the system is actually much more robust than RPM.  RPM is nothing more than a patchwork of an originally horribly written package management system.  i used it about a decade ago and it was dreadful... not much has changed in that regard since.  I don't consider 10 days as a good timeframe to judge a package management syste
2007-06-25T05:17:00.000Z	Gerrit	Gnea	The timestamping is not a major issue. However, the fact that packages asks questions interactively, is. I would like to seperate configuration from installation, because: (1) during installation, I don't know the answers to those questions (2) I would like to be able to 'walk away' during a big installation/upgrade lasting an hour or more. I am aware that it's possible to disable interactive configuration, but since debian packages are not desig
2007-06-25T05:18:00.000Z	Gerrit	Gnea	It is true that ten days is a good timeframe to judge a package management style.
2007-06-25T05:20:00.000Z	Gnea	Gerrit	of course, you are entitled to your own opinion, and hopefully you'll enjoy the fact that timestamps are, indeed, made available within the package management system via ls -l /var/lib/dpkg/info/  although I do admit that that is a bit of an issue, and maybe we should take this to #ubuntu-offtopic since the discussion doesn't seem to be helpful to other ubuntu users.
