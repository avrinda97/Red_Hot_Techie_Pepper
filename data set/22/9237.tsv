2005-01-27T08:41:00.000Z	Elk_Brad		anyone have ideas on how to get a USB drive to work?
2005-01-27T08:41:00.000Z	sladen	Elk_Brad	plug it in, it should just pop up on the deskotp
2005-01-27T08:44:00.000Z	sladen	Elk_Brad	righto, so we have a issue.  what does  sudo tail -f /var/log/messages   as you plug in the device.
2005-01-27T08:48:00.000Z	sladen	Elk_Brad	access the DVDs.  Or play the video onthe CDs?
2005-01-27T08:48:00.000Z	Elk_Brad	sladen	playing any movie format period
2005-01-27T08:49:00.000Z	sladen	Elk_Brad	it should tell you whether it recognised the device as.  Did it recongnise it.  Did it load a module,  What device did it give it
2005-01-27T08:49:00.000Z	sladen	Elk_Brad	So the DVD drive works.  Ubuntu can't ship MPEG2/decss software because of various patents and laws in various countries
2005-01-27T08:50:00.000Z	sladen	Elk_Brad	you can install them yourself.  Details on the wiki, but that choice is in your hands
2005-01-27T08:53:00.000Z	sladen	Elk_Brad	the sudo allows *you* (that is 'Elk_Brad') to performs certain tasks as other users;  for instance, as root
2005-01-27T08:54:00.000Z	sladen	Elk_Brad	correct.  Type   sudo apt-get install ...   for example
2005-01-27T09:00:00.000Z	sladen	Elk_Brad	if you need to change something;   sudo chown foo.bar file
2005-01-27T09:01:00.000Z	sladen	Elk_Brad	it ensures that you only execute the commands you /actually/ need to execute as root, as root
2005-01-27T09:01:00.000Z	sladen	Elk_Brad	not all the ls's and less's etc
