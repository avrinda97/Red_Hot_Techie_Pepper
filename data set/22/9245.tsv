2005-09-07T13:10:00.000Z	lassesandberg		can someone help me? im pretty new in ubuntu, trying to get the gstreamer mp3 plugin, but i cant find it in the synaptic
2005-09-07T13:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	you need to enable the universe repository
2005-09-07T13:11:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	you can read about this on the restrictedformats page, i believe
2005-09-07T13:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	it's called gstreamer0.8-mad, i think
2005-09-07T13:23:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	then it is likely that you have made an error. read the instructions carefully and try again; if it still doesn't work, post your /etc/apt/sources.list to the paste-bin
2005-09-07T13:25:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	fair enough. you can also put screenshots on the paste-bin, if you prefer
2005-09-07T13:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	ok, can you open 'gedit' (applications -> accessories -> text editor)
2005-09-07T13:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	ok, go to file -> open
2005-09-07T13:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	double-click 'Filesystem' (on the left)
2005-09-07T13:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	then in the list window on the right, double click 'etc', then 'apt' and then 'sources.list'
2005-09-07T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	you should see a file starting with 'deb cdrom <more stuff>'
2005-09-07T13:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	ok, leave that window open. point your browser to http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-09-07T13:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	copy and paste the text of the file (sources.list) into the large text-entry area on the web-page, and press 'send' (you can put you nick in the space, if you want)
2005-09-07T13:43:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	ok, the only repository you appear to have enabled is the sourceforge.net wine repository
2005-09-07T13:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	anything with a '#' at the front is ignored in that file
2005-09-07T13:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	cool, np
2005-09-07T13:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	lassesandberg	maybe in system -> preferences -> themes, but i'm not sure
