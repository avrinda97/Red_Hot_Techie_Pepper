2010-04-27T18:51:00.000Z	Shamoun		is it practical to run the netbook remix on a laptop that isn't a netbook?
2010-04-27T18:52:00.000Z	jadakren	Shamoun	for what purpose?
2010-04-27T18:52:00.000Z	jadakren	Shamoun	it supposedly has a kernel optimised for the atom processor.
2010-04-27T18:52:00.000Z	Shamoun	jadakren	its a smaller notebook that i only really use for the internet and to write small documents
2010-04-27T18:53:00.000Z	jadakren	Shamoun	unless you want the odd desktop it has, i would just use ubuntu with openbox or lubuntu.
2010-04-27T18:53:00.000Z	jadakren	Shamoun	but again it depends on what you're trying to achieve? low power ?
2010-04-27T18:55:00.000Z	Shamoun	jadakren	battery life would be a plus
2010-04-27T18:55:00.000Z	Shamoun	jadakren	the system runs win 7 at the moment, so if that will give me better life i might as well stick to it
2010-04-27T18:57:00.000Z	jadakren	Shamoun	Im not sure how good my netbook is with power and windows7 as i removed it five minutes after unwrapping the thing. although i assume you're familiar with the power monitor graphs etc ?
2010-04-27T18:57:00.000Z	Shamoun	jadakren	power monitor graphs?
2010-04-27T18:57:00.000Z	jadakren	Shamoun	yeah, screenshots incoming....
2010-04-27T19:03:00.000Z	jadakren	Shamoun	uploading.
2010-04-27T19:12:00.000Z	Shamoun	jadakren	er you still there?
2010-04-27T19:15:00.000Z	jadakren	Shamoun	try this : https://www.dropbox.com/photoshow/screenshots/ubuntu-9.10-power-monitor/power-manager-wakeups.png <click full size>
2010-04-27T19:15:00.000Z	Shamoun	jadakren	thanks i have to make an account, one sec
2010-04-27T19:15:00.000Z	jadakren	Shamoun	not to view it surely?
2010-04-27T19:17:00.000Z	Shamoun	jadakren	yea unfortunately, and now that i have it seems to be pointing me to that directory stucture in my account, which is of course empty
2010-04-27T19:17:00.000Z	jadakren	Shamoun	here : public link : http://www.dropbox.com/gallery/180039/2/screenshots/ubuntu-9.10-power-monitor?h=1d9252
2010-04-27T19:17:00.000Z	Shamoun	jadakren	okay that works, thanks a ton. sorry for the inconvenience
2010-04-27T19:18:00.000Z	Shamoun	jadakren	hmm, thanks, i guess ill do a dual boot system with ubuntu and win 7 and see what performs better for my needs on this laptop
2010-04-27T19:19:00.000Z	jadakren	Shamoun	yeah might be the only way you'll find out .. note that if you try to assess it via isb live disk that the usb disk will be using extra power.
2010-04-27T19:19:00.000Z	Shamoun	jadakren	yea ill do an install to hard disk
