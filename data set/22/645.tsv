2011-06-05T23:19:00.000Z	NictraSavios	rinkukokiri	I am using it now, it takes alot of extensions and the gnome-tweak-tool, but its awesome :P
2011-06-14T08:33:00.000Z	NictraSavios	rinkukokiri	eww, GUI :P mounting is part of sys admin, should be done from CLI
2011-06-14T08:33:00.000Z	NictraSavios	rinkukokiri	Only use GUI for trival things like shhing
2011-06-14T08:33:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	NictraSavios	i didn't know this was #ubuntu-server... wait it isn't
2011-06-14T08:35:00.000Z	NictraSavios	rinkukokiri	sshing is the act of connecting to another computer via a client, which has nothing to do with a ubuntu server. I use it to connect to an Iphone
2011-06-14T08:35:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	NictraSavios	i was referring to your "eww gui" remark..
2011-06-14T08:35:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	NictraSavios	and I know what SSH is.. i do have an AS in Computer Systems Security
2011-06-14T08:36:00.000Z	NictraSavios	rinkukokiri	GUI is for newbies and faildows noobs.
2011-06-14T08:36:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	NictraSavios	well good for you... anything else?? you can take it to #ubuntu-offtopic or #ubuntu-server
2011-06-14T08:37:00.000Z	NictraSavios	rinkukokiri	You brought it up, not me. Don't be a hater
2011-06-14T08:38:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	NictraSavios	you *could* go build yourself a gentoo system and leave us to our gui's
2011-06-14T08:38:00.000Z	NictraSavios	rinkukokiri	Gentoo is too stupid in the way it handles packages. Nothing agaist the distro, its the repo managers I disklike.
2011-06-14T08:40:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	NictraSavios	and FYI, people come here for support..  if a gui can provide that, so be it.
2011-06-14T08:41:00.000Z	NictraSavios	rinkukokiri	FYI, Im here for support, You started it.
2011-06-14T08:42:00.000Z	NictraSavios	rinkukokiri	You have no right to argue my opinion.
2011-06-14T08:42:00.000Z	NictraSavios	rinkukokiri	I am rude to those who are rude to me.
