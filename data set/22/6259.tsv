2006-11-21T12:45:00.000Z	Romeo_1		hey guys, is it possible to get installation packages not directly using Ubuntu?
2006-11-21T12:46:00.000Z	Romeo_1		i mean can i download that packages and install them on other computer which is not connected to internet?
2006-11-21T12:46:00.000Z	Romeo_1		i couldn't find that packages on ubuntu's offsite
2006-11-21T12:46:00.000Z	Romeo_1		could anyone help me with this?
2006-11-21T12:47:00.000Z	rioghal	Romeo_1	yes, hold on i will get you a url
2006-11-21T12:47:00.000Z	rioghal	Romeo_1	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/
2006-11-21T12:48:00.000Z	Romeo_1	rioghal	thank you very much
2006-11-21T12:49:00.000Z	rioghal	Romeo_1	basically you can open your /etc/apt/sources.list file and go to any of the official repos and follow the "pool" links
2006-11-21T12:50:00.000Z	Romeo_1	rioghal	the problem is that the computer running on Ubuntu is temporary not connected to Internet (for some reasons) but i want some software to install, that's why i'd like to get those packages and install them later
2006-11-21T12:51:00.000Z	rioghal	Romeo_1	ok, visit that url on a box that has a connection, download what you want, burn to cd, take it to the other box and install.. but you may have a problem with deps
2006-11-21T12:51:00.000Z	rioghal	Romeo_1	unless you already know which deps you need and dl those too
2006-11-21T12:52:00.000Z	Romeo_1	rioghal	anyways, i'm downloading them, and I'll try to install them as you've stated. Hope won't be any problems
2006-11-21T12:53:00.000Z	rioghal	Romeo_1	i used that method on a box without a conn, but u had to go back and forth due to the various deps. some apps have a lot of deps.. some dont have many
2006-11-21T13:01:00.000Z	Romeo_1	rioghal	one more thing, I don't really understand the differences between different Linux versions but i got only Ubuntu installation CD, what do you think - is it a good choice? or it will be pain to use for a newbie like me?
2006-11-21T13:02:00.000Z	rioghal	Romeo_1	i have been through several distros, including fedora debian archlinux centos mepis, and i feel that ubuntu is the downright best distro available. its easy to use and easy to learn.
2006-11-21T13:03:00.000Z	rioghal	Romeo_1	im a newbie too and ubuntu roxors!
2006-11-21T13:03:00.000Z	Romeo_1	rioghal	can i install apache/mysql stuff and use on network like a server with Ubuntu desktop or should i install Server version?
2006-11-21T13:04:00.000Z	rioghal	Romeo_1	i have LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL Php) installed on my desktop pc and i love it.
2006-11-21T13:05:00.000Z	Romeo_1	rioghal	i tried LAMP but got some problems that i couldn't solve with vhosts
2006-11-21T13:05:00.000Z	rioghal	Romeo_1	well, youre in a good channel to get that solved. also have a look at ubuntuforums.org  that is one nice forum
2006-11-21T13:06:00.000Z	Romeo_1	rioghal	thanx, i'll be here then for a while =)
2006-11-21T13:08:00.000Z	Romeo_1	rioghal	the as LAMP but for Windows
