2010-08-26T05:55:00.000Z	asdf-		hi, I am trying to locate a free program for windows that will allow me to write the ubuntu netbook edition to a SD card. I do not have a USB drive right now... I cannot seem to find any solutions via google
2010-08-26T05:56:00.000Z	mickster04	asdf-	have you tried using alive disk? and installing it that way?
2010-08-26T05:56:00.000Z	asdf-	mickster04	never heard of alive disk... will try netbootin first
2010-08-26T05:57:00.000Z	mickster04	asdf-	a live disk (ubuntu sio3;2~)
2010-08-26T05:57:00.000Z	mickster04	asdf-	a live disk (ubuntu iso)*
2010-08-26T05:58:00.000Z	mickster04	asdf-	how do you get all the updates without the internet?
2010-08-26T05:59:00.000Z	mickster04	asdf-	you can install without the internet using a live disk?
2010-08-26T06:01:00.000Z	mickster04	asdf-	that sounds pretty convoluted, is the camera set to the right set up for being used as a card
2010-08-26T06:03:00.000Z	mickster04	asdf-	can you write to the file just using windows?
2010-08-26T06:03:00.000Z	asdf-	mickster04	how do i make the sd card bootable then?
2010-08-26T06:04:00.000Z	mickster04	asdf-	ermm...use a normal adapter and not a camera might help
2010-08-26T06:05:00.000Z	asdf-	mickster04	im going to extract the iso to the sd's main directory
2010-08-26T06:05:00.000Z	mickster04	asdf-	well that might work, but i dunno if the camera ill let you boot from the card
2010-08-26T06:06:00.000Z	mickster04	asdf-	i thought more, burn the disk and install to the ssd card
2010-08-26T06:06:00.000Z	asdf-	mickster04	not booting from the camera... booting directly in netbook from the netbook's sd slot
2010-08-26T06:06:00.000Z	mickster04	asdf-	well use slot now?
2010-08-26T06:08:00.000Z	mickster04	asdf-	eitherway install ubuntu onto the drive rather than unloadiung the iso onto it, you will have to set the bootable bit etc
2010-08-26T06:12:00.000Z	mickster04	asdf-	so why were you using the camera when you have a sd slot?
2010-08-26T06:12:00.000Z	asdf-	mickster04	i don't have an sd adapter on my windows computer
2010-08-26T06:13:00.000Z	asdf-	mickster04	i only have my camera as an adapter for windows. my netbook has a sd slot
2010-08-26T06:13:00.000Z	mickster04	asdf-	what is on your netbook atm?
2010-08-26T06:13:00.000Z	mickster04	asdf-	OS wise?
