2011-07-28T20:38:00.000Z	cousin_mario		hello
2011-07-28T20:38:00.000Z	cousin_mario		can you think of any reason for 10.10 not setting a default gateway neither with dhcp nor with manual?
2011-07-28T20:39:00.000Z	ikonia	cousin_mario	gateway on the wrong network
2011-07-28T20:39:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ikonia	no default gateway on the system
2011-07-28T20:40:00.000Z	ikonia		well then it won't add it
2011-07-28T20:40:00.000Z	ikonia	cousin_mario	if won't use itself as the default gateway
2011-07-28T20:40:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ikonia	I don't think you understand
2011-07-28T20:41:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ikonia	the dhcp server supplies a default gateway but ubuntu doesn't set it
2011-07-28T20:41:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ikonia	I tried setting it from networkmanager but it's still being ignored
2011-07-28T20:41:00.000Z	ikonia	cousin_mario	yes, because it's on the same network
2011-07-28T20:42:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ikonia	what network?
2011-07-28T20:42:00.000Z	ikonia	cousin_mario	what is the IP address of the machine you're using
2011-07-28T20:42:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ikonia	192.168.1.100
2011-07-28T20:42:00.000Z	ikonia	cousin_mario	what's the address of the default gateway you want to use
2011-07-28T20:43:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ikonia	the default gateway is 192.168.1.1 and windows machines obtain it via dhcp and set it as default route
2011-07-28T20:43:00.000Z	ikonia	cousin_mario	right, so that should be fine, please pastebin the output of "netstat -rn"
2011-07-28T20:43:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ikonia	a sudo ip add default dev eth0 via 192.168.1.1 solves the issue, but only temporarily
2011-07-28T20:44:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ikonia	I'm debugging it via phone
2011-07-28T20:44:00.000Z	ikonia	cousin_mario	ok, then let me know when you can debug it properly with me
2011-07-28T20:45:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ikonia	I can't. I'm merely asking if there is a known bug in 10.10 about that.
2011-07-28T20:45:00.000Z	ikonia	cousin_mario	no, there is no known bug
2011-07-28T20:45:00.000Z	cousin_mario	ikonia	ok, thanks
