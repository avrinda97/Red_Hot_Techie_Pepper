2008-02-20T01:01:00.000Z	conb123		Hi im trying to boot the ubuntu live disc but it always freezes at the same point just as it loads the top and bottom bars i dont know if it is to do with the fact i have my hdd connected to a ite IT8212 ide slot
2008-02-20T01:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	conb123	try some of the boot options sugested on ubotu link page
2009-05-05T20:17:00.000Z	conb123	erUSUL	That didn't work
2009-05-05T20:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	conb123	what did not work? lsb_release -a ?
2009-05-05T20:18:00.000Z	conb123	erUSUL	Is that the command because i think that thing you typed was meant to get the bot to send me something but i didn't recieve anything
2009-05-05T20:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	conb123	it must be death... run « lsb_release -a » on a terminal
2009-05-05T20:18:00.000Z	conb123	erUSUL	Thanks
2009-12-28T23:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	conb123	there is none by default
2009-12-28T23:47:00.000Z	conb123	erUSUL	Oh, so what do i do if i want to change my X configuration?
2009-12-28T23:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	conb123	you can cretae one if you must. try « gksudo Xorg -configure »
2010-02-24T01:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	conb123	install linux-backports-modules-alsa-karmic-generic
2010-02-24T01:19:00.000Z	conb123	erUSUL	Thanks
2010-02-24T01:22:00.000Z	conb123	erUSUL	Will that auto configure the driver or should i reboot?
2010-02-24T01:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	conb123	reboot is the easier way
2010-02-24T01:23:00.000Z	conb123	erUSUL	Right cheers :)
2010-03-08T23:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	conb123	ask in #ubuntu+1
2010-03-09T00:00:00.000Z	conb123	erUSUL	Sorry
2010-03-27T22:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	conb123	use the watch command
2010-04-01T16:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	conb123	ask in ##linux
2010-06-09T22:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	conb123	file/disk cache?
2010-06-09T22:53:00.000Z	conb123	erUSUL	Ok I see, I thought memory was handled slightly differently in linux, so should I be alright giving my vm 2gb of memory or not?
2010-06-09T22:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	conb123	ubuntu should work with 2 GiB of free ram just fine (depending on what you do )
