2007-09-08T10:42:00.000Z	ikonia	MrObvious	thats not true, but this is offtopic
2008-01-13T03:48:00.000Z	ikonia	MrObvious	gftp ?
2008-01-17T02:12:00.000Z	MrObvious	ikonia	tanath: I run FAH and I'm not lagging.
2008-01-17T02:12:00.000Z	ikonia	MrObvious	is your CPU @ %100
2008-01-17T02:13:00.000Z	MrObvious	ikonia	Yup. Also FAH runs at nice level 19 by default.
2008-01-17T02:13:00.000Z	ikonia	MrObvious	so your suggesting that your CPU is at %100 constantly and you get no slowdown on your desktops response ?
2008-01-17T02:13:00.000Z	MrObvious	ikonia	Nope. Of course I have a Dell Vostro 1700 with a 1.6 GHz C2D and 8600m and 2GB of RAM. :)
2008-01-17T02:14:00.000Z	MrObvious	ikonia	But I run FAH on a 1.8 GHz P4 w\ 1GB of RAM and it's fine.
2008-01-17T02:14:00.000Z	ikonia	MrObvious	- thats fine, but tanath's cpu is at %100
2008-01-17T02:14:00.000Z	MrObvious	ikonia	What's wrong with that?
2008-01-24T02:58:00.000Z	MrObvious	ikonia	What exactly is his problem?
2008-01-24T02:59:00.000Z	ikonia	MrObvious	he wants to host a domain's dns records on a 1 ip box
2008-08-19T12:47:00.000Z	ikonia	MrObvious	sdc is not a partition
2008-08-19T12:47:00.000Z	ikonia	MrObvious	sdc1 is
2008-08-19T12:47:00.000Z	ikonia	MrObvious	you mount a partition, not a disk
2008-08-19T12:48:00.000Z	MrObvious	ikonia	Don't confuse me. Haha. Sorry I'm very tired and having a beer (which hasn't set in yet).
2008-08-19T12:50:00.000Z	MrObvious	ikonia	Don't confuse him, he is probably tired too. :p
2008-08-19T12:50:00.000Z	ikonia	MrObvious	I'm not confusing him -  I'm giving him fact
2008-08-19T12:50:00.000Z	MrObvious	ikonia	You are confusing me in the process.
