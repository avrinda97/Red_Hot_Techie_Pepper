2010-05-07T09:54:00.000Z	Prez00		ok, guys, I am running out of ideas for what to do about compiz and window borders.  compiz seems to load but i am left without window borders on my x61, intel 965 graphics.  i checked the window decoration plugin and it's got right line there...
2010-05-07T09:55:00.000Z	Prez00		any pointers?
2010-05-07T09:55:00.000Z	ratshell	Prez00	what line is there?
2010-05-07T09:55:00.000Z	Prez00	ratshell	/usr/bin/compiz-decorator
2010-05-07T09:56:00.000Z	ratshell	Prez00	yeah that is the right line, try /usr/bin/compiz-decorator --replace
2010-05-07T09:57:00.000Z	ratshell	Prez00	just put that line in and then uncheck the window decoration and check it again
2010-05-07T09:58:00.000Z	Prez00	ratshell	nothin' it does nothing..
2010-05-07T09:59:00.000Z	ratshell	Prez00	only other guess I have is try using emerald window manager instead of the compiz one
2010-05-07T09:59:00.000Z	Prez00	ratshell	got it installed, tried emerald --replace as well
2010-05-07T09:59:00.000Z	ratshell	Prez00	do you have a theme picked in the emerald manager?
2010-05-07T09:59:00.000Z	Prez00	ratshell	still no borders..
2010-05-07T10:00:00.000Z	Prez00	ratshell	i think i tired to pick theme and it closes the emerald manager
2010-05-07T10:00:00.000Z	ratshell	Prez00	thinking
2010-05-07T10:01:00.000Z	ratshell	Prez00	your using a nvidia card right?
2010-05-07T10:02:00.000Z	Prez00	ratshell	intel 965 on lenovo x61 upgrade from karmic, where compiz worked fine
2010-05-07T10:02:00.000Z	ratshell	Prez00	look at this link has something about same problem your having no window borders, compiz or emerald. An exception was thrown by the type initializer for Tomboy.TomboyDBus ---> System.Exception: U

2010-05-07T10:02:00.000Z	Prez00	ratshell	i can do glxgears and compiz-check says all ok
2010-05-07T10:03:00.000Z	ratshell	Prez00	it sounds like your xorg.conf needs to be tweaked, read that post it says what to do.
2010-05-07T10:07:00.000Z	Prez00	ratshell	applied tweaks... rebooting...
2010-05-07T10:07:00.000Z	ratshell	Prez00	good luck
2010-05-07T10:07:00.000Z	Prez00	ratshell	we'll see how it goes
