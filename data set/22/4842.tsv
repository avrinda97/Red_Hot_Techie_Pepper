2008-01-26T21:42:00.000Z	emma		I guess linux has it's advantages but it's the least efficient operating system by far.
2008-01-26T21:43:00.000Z	emma		I don't see how it is efficient when after 4 hours I still can't do what I want to do. That's a lot of wasted time. Multiply that by every user and think of the lost productivity. With any other OS surely I would be doing what I wanted to do instead of trying to learn the OS after 4 hours.
2008-01-26T21:44:00.000Z	emma		Wrong. You can't just call every person with a valid complaint a troll. That makes you a sycophant.
2008-01-26T21:44:00.000Z	emma		The whole purpose of Ubuntu is user friendliness. People should realize that Ubuntu has a long way to go.
2008-01-26T21:44:00.000Z	bazhang	emma	four hours is hardly enough time to form a valid opinion
2008-03-16T02:18:00.000Z	bazhang	emma	yes we see you
2008-05-08T16:25:00.000Z	bazhang	emma	:)
2008-05-14T16:22:00.000Z	emma	bazhang	- I already gave him that link. ;)
2008-05-17T21:01:00.000Z	bazhang	emma	please ask before PM'ing me thanks
2008-05-17T21:02:00.000Z	emma	bazhang	certainly. may I pm you?
2008-05-17T21:02:00.000Z	bazhang	emma	please ask in channel for the benefit of all
2008-05-17T21:03:00.000Z	emma	bazhang	- This has to do with comments you made. Is that something you want to talk about here?
2008-05-17T21:03:00.000Z	bazhang	emma	join ubuntu-ops
2008-05-17T21:39:00.000Z	emma	bazhang	you can pm me whenever you like.
2008-06-16T09:37:00.000Z	emma	bazhang	they are very helpful there.
2008-06-16T09:37:00.000Z	emma	bazhang	that was a misshighligt.
2008-08-30T07:49:00.000Z	bazhang	emma	certainly; via unetbootin, usb, for starters
2008-08-30T07:51:00.000Z	bazhang	emma	sadly not that simple
2008-08-30T07:54:00.000Z	bazhang	emma	it may not allow for booting from usb
2008-11-11T18:49:00.000Z	bazhang	emma	you are always taking a risk when you go outside ubuntu package management
2008-11-11T19:05:00.000Z	emma	bazhang	I thought it might be a legitimate alternative to kubuntu users who dont' want to install all the GNOME libs on their kubuntu.
2008-11-14T16:57:00.000Z	bazhang	emma	install nvidia-settings
