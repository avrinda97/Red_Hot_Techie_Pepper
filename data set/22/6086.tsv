2009-02-07T20:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Decepticon	you probably won't need a new power supply, but you'll need an IDE to SATA adapter (most sata drives come w/ them I do believe)
2009-02-07T20:02:00.000Z	Decepticon	IndyGunFreak	why should i get a ide-to-sata adapter. i wnt a sata card so i can plug in sata hdds from now on, instead of buying expensive ide
2009-02-07T20:02:00.000Z	Decepticon	IndyGunFreak	i want to go away from ide
2009-02-07T20:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Decepticon	you said you were poor, i was trying to give you the cheapest solution.
2009-02-07T20:03:00.000Z	Decepticon	IndyGunFreak	ah ok
2009-02-07T20:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Decepticon	have you considered just saving the bones to build a new cheap PC?
2009-02-07T20:05:00.000Z	Decepticon	IndyGunFreak	i got this pc for $50 bucks, gettign a new one would be $150 over that, with the sata and such capability at least
2009-02-07T20:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Decepticon	well how old is the $50 PC?
2009-02-07T20:06:00.000Z	Decepticon	IndyGunFreak	its a pentium 4
2009-02-07T20:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Decepticon	yeah... well, by the time you buy all the crap to make it work w/ SATA, you probably could have built a cheaper one.
2009-02-07T20:07:00.000Z	Decepticon	IndyGunFreak	im seriosuly consiodering a new one
2009-02-07T20:07:00.000Z	Decepticon	IndyGunFreak	i just hate having to buy old hardware, i keep getting gyped
