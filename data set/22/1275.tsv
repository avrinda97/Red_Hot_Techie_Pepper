2010-07-22T08:30:00.000Z	cyberal		hello
2010-07-22T08:30:00.000Z	cyberal		I need help ASAP on installing ubuntu 10.04
2010-07-22T08:31:00.000Z	cyberal		i have burned a cd with it
2010-07-22T08:32:00.000Z	cyberal		while booting, i'm having weird problem, the screen starts nice and pretty and then either a bunch of colored lines or colored dots appears and stops
2010-07-22T08:32:00.000Z	cyberal		i have a laptop w/ nvidia card on it
2010-07-22T08:32:00.000Z	cyberal		i heard that nvidia is the problem
2010-07-22T08:32:00.000Z	cyberal		is this true?
2010-07-22T08:33:00.000Z	soreau	cyberal	It's likely the driver
2010-07-22T08:33:00.000Z	soreau	cyberal	thought it could be bad vram. Does it work with 3D on any other OS?
2010-07-22T08:42:00.000Z	cyberal	soreau	thank you very much!!!
2010-07-22T08:35:00.000Z	soreau	cyberal	Then it's likely a driver issue. Did you install the proprietary drivers yet or are you still using nouveau?
2010-07-22T08:37:00.000Z	soreau	cyberal	try booting with kernel option nomodeset
2010-07-22T08:37:00.000Z	cyberal	soreau	you got my last msg?
2010-07-22T08:37:00.000Z	soreau	cyberal	yes
2010-07-22T08:37:00.000Z	soreau	cyberal	press esc when the cd first boots
2010-07-22T08:37:00.000Z	cyberal	soreau	how do i do that?
2010-07-22T08:37:00.000Z	soreau	cyberal	then go to boot options
2010-07-22T08:38:00.000Z	cyberal	soreau	then what?
2010-07-22T08:39:00.000Z	soreau	cyberal	Hopefully booting without modesetting will cause the nouveau driver to not do anything drastic with the card
2010-07-22T08:40:00.000Z	cyberal	soreau	so, is this option "nomodeset" available when i press the esc from boot?
2010-07-22T08:41:00.000Z	cyberal	soreau	then, any other detail before i leave this channel and go try myself :) ?
2010-07-22T08:42:00.000Z	soreau	cyberal	Yes, I think it is set as a list option so you don't have to type it in
