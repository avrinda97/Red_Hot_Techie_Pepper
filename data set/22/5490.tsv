2007-05-13T07:41:00.000Z	Gerro	soundray	which ones?
2007-05-13T07:41:00.000Z	soundray	Gerro	bcm43xx
2007-05-13T07:40:00.000Z	soundray	Gerro	closed-source wifi drivers are a killer
2007-05-13T07:41:00.000Z	Gerro	soundray	ndiswrapper covers most them but I think one in ubuntu repository is older
2007-05-13T07:42:00.000Z	Gerro	soundray	remember to get the windows wireless driver that is either 32 bit or 64 bit whatever your system is
2007-05-13T07:45:00.000Z	soundray	Gerro	I like 64bit, but for most people who come here and ask which to install, i386 is the better choice.
2007-05-13T07:46:00.000Z	Gerro	soundray	nonsense the best quality about linux is that it installs on anything
2007-05-13T07:47:00.000Z	soundray	Gerro	not nonsense. These people come back and ask how to do this and that on 64bit, and they're finding it a pain to deal with.
2007-05-13T07:47:00.000Z	Gerro	soundray	name an example?
2007-05-13T07:47:00.000Z	soundray	Gerro	it's just not the best choice for everyone, even if the hardware support is there.
2007-05-13T07:48:00.000Z	soundray	Gerro	the ones already discussed. No, it is not straightforward to install firefox32 on amd64.
2007-05-13T07:48:00.000Z	soundray	Gerro	and flash and codecs and drivers and wine...
2007-05-13T07:49:00.000Z	Gerro	soundray	was for me
2007-05-13T07:49:00.000Z	soundray	Gerro	you're probably a genius. The average person asking for help here isn't.
2007-05-13T07:49:00.000Z	Gerro	soundray	vega no noob, we kool
2007-05-13T07:50:00.000Z	Gerro	soundray	I think your just a rather old user of ubuntu, the latest model is a bit different
2007-05-13T07:51:00.000Z	Gerro	soundray	no offense but don't have to worry about 32 bit installs screwing up apt anymore
2007-05-13T07:51:00.000Z	Gerro	soundray	chrooting and all that annoyed heck out of me before
2007-05-13T07:52:00.000Z	soundray	Gerro	not at all. I run three feisty machines at home, two of them 64bit. Also have a 64bit edgy still. *I* can deal with those problems fine.
2007-05-13T07:53:00.000Z	soundray	Gerro	but making people install amd64 if they don't need it causes unnecessary traffic on this channel.
2007-05-13T07:53:00.000Z	Gerro	soundray	only unnecessary traffic I've seen is making people install those old busted restricted modules. Seriously easy to do 64 bit stuff..
