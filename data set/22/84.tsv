2012-09-26T15:06:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		Hello. :)
2012-09-26T15:06:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		New Ubuntu user here. :) :)
2012-09-26T15:06:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		Very happy with it!
2012-09-26T15:08:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		It's awesome.
2012-09-26T15:08:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		Just downloading vim, then I should probably get a proper IRC client.
2012-09-26T15:08:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		Yes dr_willis
2012-09-26T15:08:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		Which IRC client would you suggest, dr_willis?
2012-09-26T15:09:00.000Z	fidel	Shazer[2]	great to hear. a general hint: this channel is focusing on troubleshooting/support - while there is an ubuntu-offtopic channel as well
2012-09-26T15:20:00.000Z	fidel	Shazer[2]	how do you try ti install vim?
2012-09-26T15:21:00.000Z	Shazer[2]	fidel	I did ./configure.. and I got that error?
2012-09-26T15:21:00.000Z	fidel	Shazer[2]	why dont youz install via apt?
2012-09-26T15:21:00.000Z	fidel	Shazer[2]	vim is available via your paket-managmeent - whoch you should almost always use
2012-09-26T15:22:00.000Z	fidel	Shazer[2]	compiling manualy should be done only in special cases - if you NEED to ;)
2012-09-26T15:23:00.000Z	fidel	Shazer[2]	its one of several bots used in this irc-network - there is a team behind and a bot-team channel (which i dont remember)
2012-09-26T15:25:00.000Z	fidel	Shazer[2]	apt-cache search SEARCHPHRASE
2012-09-26T15:25:00.000Z	fidel	Shazer[2]	this will let apt search for the string SEARCHPHRASE
2012-09-26T15:25:00.000Z	fidel	Shazer[2]	and return a list of matching packages
2012-09-26T15:26:00.000Z	fidel	Shazer[2]	a general hint if you want to work with apt in terminal. consider reading an apt tutorial - to get started with it
2012-09-26T15:26:00.000Z	fidel	Shazer[2]	apt comes with a lot of options - and its pretty important to understand it - at least if you want to work from terminal - instead of software -center
2012-09-26T16:48:00.000Z	fidel	Shazer[2]	are you 'somehow' trying to run 2 update-processes?
2012-09-26T16:48:00.000Z	fidel	Shazer[2]	and 1 single terminal displays the lock message?
2012-09-26T17:00:00.000Z	fidel	Shazer[2]	plug in your usb-device and open your file-manager (nautilus most likely)
