2010-09-09T04:49:00.000Z	Eclectic		Is it possible to install 32bit Firefox on 64bit Ubuntu?
2010-09-09T04:49:00.000Z	jrib	Eclectic	why?
2010-09-09T04:52:00.000Z	jrib	Eclectic	you don't need 32bit firefox for flash
2010-09-09T04:53:00.000Z	Eclectic	jrib	i read there is no 64 bit support for flash
2010-09-09T04:54:00.000Z	jrib	Eclectic	nspluginwrapper lets you use 32bit flash. Just visit some site that requires flash (not youtube because they detect you don't have flash)
2010-09-09T04:54:00.000Z	jrib	Eclectic	erm, after you're on that site, you'll get a yellow bar at the top of firefox offering to install missing plugins
2010-09-09T04:56:00.000Z	Eclectic	jrib	for some reason i have never gotten that yellow bar
2010-09-09T04:57:00.000Z	jrib	Eclectic	if you want me to guess, I'd say you already have some flash plugin installed
2010-09-09T04:57:00.000Z	jrib	Eclectic	what does http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/ say?
2010-09-09T04:59:00.000Z	Eclectic	jrib	successfully installed
2010-09-09T04:59:00.000Z	jrib	Eclectic	there you go
2010-09-09T05:00:00.000Z	jrib	Eclectic	why?
2010-09-09T05:01:00.000Z	jrib	Eclectic	if you have flash installed, and your goal is to install flash, why would you uninstall it and start over?
2010-09-09T05:01:00.000Z	Eclectic	jrib	because the site says i still need flash installed
2010-09-09T05:02:00.000Z	jrib	Eclectic	what version does the link I gave you say you have?  What site says you still need flash installed?
2010-09-09T05:02:00.000Z	Eclectic	jrib	 I'm sorry that is an active X that needs to be installed
2010-09-09T05:03:00.000Z	jrib	Eclectic	ah, well active x is some internet explorer thing
2010-09-09T05:04:00.000Z	jrib	Eclectic	what kind of learning?
2010-09-09T05:06:00.000Z	Eclectic	jrib	 thanks much
2010-09-09T05:07:00.000Z	jrib	Eclectic	there was some tux program that did basic arithmetic I think.  Check out edubuntu, they probably have some good programs installed by default (and those programs will be in the ubuntu repositories because the repositories are the same
2010-09-09T05:07:00.000Z	Eclectic	jrib	 thanks i'll try that
2010-09-09T05:08:00.000Z	jrib	Eclectic	http://gcompris.net/wiki/Manual looks pretty good (linked from edubuntu)
