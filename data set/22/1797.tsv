2010-03-08T22:05:00.000Z	evud		Hello. I bought a printer(Lexmark E260D), I installed the printer into the system by using the .ppd files I found on the printer's cd. The problem is, there are pdf files that are printer very quick in very good quality and there are other pdf files which take very very much time to go to the printer and the quality isn't so good. Why is this happening? Any ideas? I mean, I'm printing .pdf files, why some have good quality and other bad?
2010-03-08T22:06:00.000Z	eraggo	evud	is other pdf more or less image scanned? sometimes that may occur too :)
2010-03-08T22:06:00.000Z	evud	eraggo	thanks for your anser. What do you mean by image scanned? The .pdf with the bad printing quality was taken from a .ps file and made pdf
2010-03-08T22:07:00.000Z	eraggo	evud	both plain text?
2010-03-08T22:07:00.000Z	evud	eraggo	plain text is printed in very good quality and very fast
2010-03-08T22:08:00.000Z	eraggo	evud	good. is there image on that "bad quality" 1
2010-03-08T22:09:00.000Z	evud	eraggo	no, only tables and some strange mathematical symbols
2010-03-08T22:10:00.000Z	eraggo	evud	hmm.. is the difference how big? i mean in time
2010-03-08T22:11:00.000Z	evud	eraggo	yes, it could take 30 seconds for the printer to start printing one page. If there are two pages it takes much longer(1 minute +)
2010-03-08T22:11:00.000Z	eraggo	evud	is there difference between sizes of those pdf's?
2010-03-08T22:13:00.000Z	evud	eraggo	The one that is printed in bad quality is 75 pages and 412KB of size and the other is 4 pages and 28KB size
2010-03-08T22:15:00.000Z	eraggo	evud	weird; when you look these documents on screen you see quality differences?
2010-03-08T22:17:00.000Z	evud	eraggo	If I zoom up to 200% I think the one printed in bad quality has also worse quality in it's pdf than the other printed in good quality.
2010-03-08T22:19:00.000Z	eraggo	evud	is documents scanned or wrote on text prormam? :)
2010-03-08T22:20:00.000Z	evud	eraggo	the bad quality one doesn't seem scanned, It's like someone wrote it in latex and then did it in pdf. The one with the good quality seems to be writter in openoffice and then done to pdf
2010-03-08T22:22:00.000Z	eraggo	evud	maybe latex gave bit too much black spots to document and printer tries to select which opints it prints and which not :)
2010-03-08T22:23:00.000Z	evud	eraggo	Well, Is there a way to fix this if we have the .ps for example of the file? :S (I didn't quite understand what you said)
2010-03-08T22:25:00.000Z	eraggo	evud	i dont thinks that there is straight way to boost quality but im looking in ut
2010-03-08T22:28:00.000Z	evud	eraggo	Well, thank you very much for your help! I tried some other .pdf files too and they are being printed very well, so I guess the one .pdf I tried doesn't have so good quality
2010-03-08T22:28:00.000Z	evud		as you said
2010-03-08T22:29:00.000Z	eraggo	evud	latex makes pdf part from bitmap image and sometimes quality sucks
2010-03-08T22:30:00.000Z	evud	eraggo	ok. thank you very much for your time and help ;)
