2005-06-18T06:32:00.000Z	Nazyr	IIIEars	I get a kernel panic - not syncing error about 60 seconds after machine boots
2005-06-18T06:33:00.000Z	IIIEars	Nazyr	- Did you spot the module/app loaded at boot that might cause it?
2005-06-18T06:34:00.000Z	Nazyr	IIIEars	nope everything boots fine
2005-06-18T06:36:00.000Z	Nazyr	IIIEars	LiveCD doesnt work .. doesnt recognize my mouse or keyboard

2005-06-18T06:41:00.000Z	Nazyr	IIIEars	lol will be if I can get something other than WinXP installed
2005-06-18T06:42:00.000Z	IIIEars	Nazyr	- a boot log would be golden. - not sure it's possible with the live CD. - :/
2005-06-18T06:42:00.000Z	Nazyr	IIIEars	Ill see if I can get it .. brb
2005-06-18T07:33:00.000Z	Nazyr	IIIEars	only error I could find was about hardware system clock
2005-06-18T07:33:00.000Z	IIIEars	Nazyr	- wDo you think commenting it out would work for a bit?
2005-06-18T07:34:00.000Z	IIIEars	Nazyr	- it makes me nervous
2005-06-18T07:34:00.000Z	Nazyr	IIIEars	well the weird bit is this .. I can boot to rescue mode and it doesnt kernel panic .. and .. it doesnt error on loading hardware clock
2005-06-18T07:34:00.000Z	IIIEars	Nazyr	- give me a sec. the wiki has something i think.
