2012-01-01T03:57:00.000Z	k4r1m		I'm having an issue with gnoem3, its installed and so as the shell theme but it loading up the old classic theme and not shell for some reason, also there is no themes to select in the gnome tweak tool.. any ideas?
2012-01-01T03:58:00.000Z	robin0800	k4r1m	install gnome-themes-standard
2012-01-01T03:59:00.000Z	k4r1m	robin0800	already installed
2012-01-01T04:01:00.000Z	robin0800	k4r1m	on log in screen think gnome shell is just gnome but needs even more resources than unity
2012-01-01T04:02:00.000Z	k4r1m	robin0800	I did get gdm to load up fine
2012-01-01T04:03:00.000Z	robin0800	k4r1m	what version of ubuntu are you running?
2012-01-01T04:04:00.000Z	k4r1m	robin0800	11.10
2012-01-01T04:04:00.000Z	robin0800	k4r1m	well its lightdm not gdm in 11.10
2012-01-01T04:05:00.000Z	k4r1m	robin0800	I reconfigured it.
2012-01-01T04:05:00.000Z	k4r1m	robin0800	also I just tried installing a few themes from webupd8 but they are not showing up in the tweak tool
2012-01-01T04:06:00.000Z	robin0800	k4r1m	you have to restart the shell to see them
2012-01-01T04:07:00.000Z	k4r1m	robin0800	I did.. numerous times
2012-01-01T04:08:00.000Z	robin0800	k4r1m	think you need dconf editor for that
2012-01-01T04:10:00.000Z	k4r1m	robin0800	I don't think gnome-shell is loaded haha
2012-01-01T04:11:00.000Z	robin0800	k4r1m	no shell or extensions or shell themes if you are not in gnome shell
2012-01-01T04:13:00.000Z	robin0800	k4r1m	is it in the log in screen list
2012-01-01T04:15:00.000Z	robin0800	k4r1m	gnome is the gnome shell
2012-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	robin0800	k4r1m	if you don't see it it is probably crashing as gnome classic is a fallback
2012-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	robin0800	k4r1m	yes try that
2012-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	robin0800	k4r1m	try gnome-shell
2012-01-01T04:21:00.000Z	robin0800	k4r1m	shell uses clutter instead of compiz or metacity and of course different resources
2012-01-01T04:22:00.000Z	k4r1m	robin0800	yeah i think thats the problem, im installing the dirvers right now
