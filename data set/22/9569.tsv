2010-12-19T14:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 either it crashes, or you accidently removed it while removing other stuff from the panel.
2010-12-19T14:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 ubuntu-tweak has a tool to totally reset all settings
2010-12-19T14:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 or play with teh appearance settings to get what you like
2010-12-19T15:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 what are you talking about?
2010-12-23T19:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 theres a way to add custome nautilus menu items, via teh nautilus scripts. but you may have to research it a little bit.
2010-12-23T19:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 i recall there being some nautiuls python menu package/tool out also that added some neat menu items/features as well.
2010-12-23T19:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 http://www.giuspen.com/nautilus-pyextensions/ , i alwo recall ubuntu-tweak had some extras for the menus as well.
2010-12-31T17:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 its not clear what youa re looking for excactly.
2010-12-31T17:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 you want to duplicate teh windows7 libraries feature then is what you are saying.
2010-12-31T17:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 i think theres some 'fuse' tools that could sort of emulate that effect.
2010-12-31T17:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 Fuse is a very powerfull   thing.t hat has dozens of 'special' filesystems
2010-12-31T17:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 unionfs-fuse sort of does what you want. but it willneed some configiraton
2010-12-31T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 hmm?
2010-12-31T17:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 sudo apt-get install unionfs-fuse and check its docs/man page.. ive neer used  that specific fuse fs.
2010-12-31T17:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 ive NO idea where you came up with 'run install-sh' from...
2010-12-31T17:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 you are doing it totally wrong.
2010-12-31T17:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 use the package manager tool to install the unionfs-fuse package.
2010-12-31T17:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	---------------------->    sudo apt-get install unionfs-fuse and check its docs/man page.. ive neer used  that specific fuse fs.
2010-12-31T17:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 a shell script can be any of several dozen languages in linux.
2010-12-31T17:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 windows.bat = dos commands.
2010-12-31T17:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tristan3199us1	 thats the codename for the beta version i think.
