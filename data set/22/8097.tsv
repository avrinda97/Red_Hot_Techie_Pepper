2005-10-25T12:52:00.000Z	after8		jazzcrazed, you get anywhere?
2005-10-25T12:52:00.000Z	jazzcrazed	after8	not so much...it's frozen on "Loading, please wait..."
2005-10-25T12:53:00.000Z	after8	jazzcrazed	try to reboot it. my old dell does that from time to time
2005-10-25T12:53:00.000Z	jazzcrazed	after8	ok...managed to ctrl-alt-del it
2005-10-25T12:53:00.000Z	jazzcrazed	after8	so boot into 686 again?
2005-10-25T12:53:00.000Z	after8	jazzcrazed	and 386 with kernel headers didnt want to work right?
2005-10-25T12:54:00.000Z	jazzcrazed	after8	do u mean the make thing?
2005-10-25T12:54:00.000Z	jazzcrazed	after8	yea, i got the same error in 2.6.12-9-386
2005-10-25T12:55:00.000Z	after8	jazzcrazed	so the 686 is cos of acpi?
2005-10-25T12:57:00.000Z	jazzcrazed	after8	sry, afk for a sec
2005-10-25T12:58:00.000Z	jazzcrazed	after8	i dunno if it's acpi, it just freezes at "loading, please wait"
2005-10-25T12:58:00.000Z	after8	jazzcrazed	try recovery mode for the 686 kernel.
2005-10-25T12:58:00.000Z	jazzcrazed	after8	386, tho, gets further than that, but it freezes pretty bad when it says "loading acpi modules"
2005-10-25T12:59:00.000Z	after8	jazzcrazed	try stopping power management in the bios
2005-10-25T12:59:00.000Z	jazzcrazed	after8	hmm, that's a good idea
2005-10-25T13:00:00.000Z	after8	jazzcrazed	recoverymode will give you more clues normally
2005-10-25T13:01:00.000Z	jazzcrazed	after8	i was workin in 9-386 recovery mode b4, actually
2005-10-25T13:02:00.000Z	after8	jazzcrazed	ahhh.... some kernel worry going on there then. turn it off in bios, see if that helps some
2005-10-25T13:02:00.000Z	jazzcrazed	after8	k... huntin in bios now
2005-10-25T13:03:00.000Z	jazzcrazed	after8	this acer's bios leaves much to be desired, it seems
2005-10-25T13:04:00.000Z	after8	jazzcrazed	hmmm.
2005-10-25T13:04:00.000Z	after8	jazzcrazed	been there? http://www.linux-laptop.net/
