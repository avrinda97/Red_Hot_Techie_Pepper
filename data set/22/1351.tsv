2010-06-14T12:02:00.000Z	AAA	triaspia	 service network-manager restart fixes it sometimes, others a reboot
2010-06-14T12:02:00.000Z	AAA	triaspia	 I've tried doing it manually after stopping network-manager to no avail. there is a bug, somewhere, for sure
2010-06-14T12:03:00.000Z	AAA	triaspia	 you can also try /etc/init.d/dbus restart to fix your wifi connect issues
