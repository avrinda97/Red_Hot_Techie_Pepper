2007-02-13T11:00:00.000Z	morka		hi all
2007-02-13T11:00:00.000Z	morka		I have this browser appliance virtual machine from vmware, it's apparently loaded with ubuntu breezy
2007-02-13T11:01:00.000Z	morka		how do I upgrade it to at least dapper?
2007-02-13T11:01:00.000Z	morka		or even better, edgy
2007-02-13T11:01:00.000Z	n2diy	morka	what are you running now?
2007-02-13T11:01:00.000Z	morka	n2diy	breezy
2007-02-13T11:02:00.000Z	n2diy	morka	Breezy is 5.10 right? Upgrade to Dagger, and, if you insist, then Edgy, but don't jump over Dapper.
2007-02-13T11:02:00.000Z	morka	n2diy	so it's best to upgrade one step over?
2007-02-13T11:03:00.000Z	n2diy	morka	no, don't skip a distro, follow the order.
2007-02-13T11:03:00.000Z	morka	n2diy	is it better just to run a fresh install?
2007-02-13T11:04:00.000Z	n2diy	morka	yes, IMO, provided you are backed up, or are willing to lose stuff.
2007-02-13T11:05:00.000Z	n2diy	morka	If /home isn't on it's own partition, and you don't know what you are doing, you should be learning how to back up, not upgrade.
2007-02-13T11:05:00.000Z	morka	n2diy	i just copied my vmware image :)
2007-02-13T11:05:00.000Z	n2diy	morka	I'm not familiar with VMware.
2007-02-13T11:06:00.000Z	n2diy	morka	Winders emulator? I will never be familiar with it then. :)
2007-02-13T11:07:00.000Z	morka	n2diy	its a cross platform emulator
2007-02-13T11:08:00.000Z	n2diy	morka	Anything on anything!? My Vic-20 stuff will run on it?
2007-02-13T11:08:00.000Z	morka	n2diy	is it x86 :) ?
2007-02-13T11:10:00.000Z	n2diy	morka	Umm, no, if IRCC, it is Moto 6800, or something like that. Seriously, I'm wasting your time, maybe someone else can help you, good luck.
2007-02-13T11:47:00.000Z	n2diy	morka	check the bug list, that is #1 on the list.
2007-02-13T11:52:00.000Z	n2diy	morka	that is a joke, they get fixed, renamed and you have to pay for them.
2007-02-13T11:53:00.000Z	n2diy	morka	you should take this to #ubuntu-marketing.
