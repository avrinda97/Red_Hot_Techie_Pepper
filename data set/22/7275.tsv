2006-07-30T15:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		the book 'using samba' is avilable online. for free. :P
2006-07-30T15:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		basiciaily you need to make a user for each kid, and a smbpasswd -a USERNAME for each kid.  then  edit the samba.conf to allow writeable home dirs.

2006-07-30T15:53:00.000Z	bbrazil	Dr_Willis	the really nice way would be to use 'passwd' and the pam_smb module
