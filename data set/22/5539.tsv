2007-12-04T03:38:00.000Z	ouellettesr	magnetron	shouldn't the installer have installed grub?
2007-12-04T03:39:00.000Z	magnetron	ouellettesr	the installer will give you the option to install grub, but for some reason, it seems damage. ubotu provided you with instructions for repair
2007-12-04T03:52:00.000Z	ouellettesr	magnetron	I tried the link on repairing my grub and it doesn't work
2007-12-04T03:52:00.000Z	magnetron	ouellettesr	oh, sorry about that
2007-12-04T03:54:00.000Z	ouellettesr	magnetron	well jst like I said it does not work, the tutorial says to use tab completion to find the root partition, and tab only returns a list of commands
2007-12-04T03:54:00.000Z	ouellettesr	magnetron	oh sorry about that
2007-12-04T03:56:00.000Z	magnetron	ouellettesr	first type "root " THEN hit tab for tab completion
2007-12-04T03:56:00.000Z	magnetron	ouellettesr	no
2007-12-04T03:56:00.000Z	magnetron	ouellettesr	do that
2007-12-04T03:57:00.000Z	ouellettesr	magnetron	ir brings me to the grub prompt, then if I hit tab, it returns a list of commands
2007-12-04T03:57:00.000Z	magnetron	ouellettesr	then, inside the grub menu, type root <space> <tab tab tab>
2007-12-04T03:58:00.000Z	ouellettesr	magnetron	that returns, Error 1: Filename must be either an absolute pathname or blocklist
2007-12-04T03:59:00.000Z	magnetron	ouellettesr	try using the find command in grub as desscribed on the web page
2007-12-04T04:00:00.000Z	ouellettesr	magnetron	I think im going to try reinstalling it one more time
2008-02-25T05:28:00.000Z	magnetron	ouellettesr	connected via Bluetooth?
2008-02-25T05:28:00.000Z	magnetron	ouellettesr	it's probably on an emulated serial port
2008-02-25T05:29:00.000Z	ouellettesr	magnetron	i believe it is, usually its ttyUSB0 but thats not showing up
2008-03-14T23:20:00.000Z	magnetron	ouellettesr	it's not safe.
2008-03-14T23:21:00.000Z	ouellettesr	magnetron	why not?
2008-03-14T23:26:00.000Z	ouellettesr	magnetron	any idea why its not safe, someone else told me it was safe
