2011-09-11T01:21:00.000Z	avinashhm	spill	happens even when battery is plugged in ..
2011-09-11T01:02:00.000Z	spill	avinashhm	goto power managment and uncheck "dim display when idle"
2011-09-11T01:04:00.000Z	avinashhm	spill	i ll check this .. just a doubt, are there any applications which cause this brightness up, down .. should i check for them
2011-09-11T01:06:00.000Z	spill	avinashhm	if its the option I said, it would get bright when you touched the mouse.
2011-09-11T01:06:00.000Z	spill	avinashhm	on battery there is also a "reduce backlit brightness" which can do the same thing.
2011-09-11T01:07:00.000Z	avinashhm	spill	actually .. even when i type i see that the brightness is less .. this happens mostly during evenings .. so activity isn't a problem ..
2011-09-11T01:07:00.000Z	spill	avinashhm	both settings are in the "power manager"
2011-09-11T01:08:00.000Z	spill	avinashhm	I'd still check that first and see, its a quick fix if its that and an easy elimination if its not.
2011-09-11T01:08:00.000Z	avinashhm	spill	sure .. i ll check both now ..
2011-09-11T01:15:00.000Z	avinashhm	spill	i checked the settings in power management .. reduce brightness on idle wasn't set ... and backlight  brigtness setting is also proper ..
2011-09-11T01:18:00.000Z	spill	avinashhm	hmm. how fast does it fluctuate?
2011-09-11T01:19:00.000Z	avinashhm	spill	quite fast .. within a second , brightness reduces to half .. then randomly sometimes, it increases again within a second .. sometimes 5 min .. sometimes 1 min
2011-09-11T01:20:00.000Z	spill	avinashhm	when plugged in or on battery?
2011-09-11T01:23:00.000Z	spill	avinashhm	I would try turning off the power manager at boot from the "startup applications" menu and see if it still does it.  Should be able to check in off and back on again if it doesnt change.
2011-09-11T01:24:00.000Z	avinashhm	spill	i will try to disable power manager ...
2011-09-11T01:24:00.000Z	spill	avinashhm	also see if there are any drivers made just for you video card?
2011-09-11T01:24:00.000Z	spill	avinashhm	go there after you check power man
2011-09-11T01:25:00.000Z	avinashhm	spill	sure .. i ll investigate this pointer also .. thanks very much ..
2011-09-11T01:26:00.000Z	spill	avinashhm	sure. I've been there so keep at it and you get it ;). its trial and error trying to find the source sometime though
2011-09-11T01:26:00.000Z	avinashhm	spill	is it ... ? good 2 know, i am not the only 1 ;-) ...
