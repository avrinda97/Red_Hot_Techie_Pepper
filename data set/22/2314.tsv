2010-08-26T16:32:00.000Z	eino		oh yea and I'm using the 9.04 version
2010-08-26T16:32:00.000Z	eino		if that changes anything
2010-08-26T16:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eino	 what exactly are yoy trying to startup?
2010-08-26T16:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eino	 i would just start it from /etc/rc.local and be done with it.  :) Unless you really want it to work as a 'service'
2010-08-26T16:34:00.000Z	eino	Dr_Willis	allright, I'll try that
2010-08-26T16:35:00.000Z	eino	Dr_Willis	what do i type in it? :D
2010-08-26T16:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eino	 whatever command starts the progam
2010-08-26T16:35:00.000Z	eino	Dr_Willis	okay
2010-08-26T16:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eino	 put them befor the exit statement with & at the end..
2010-08-26T16:36:00.000Z	eino	Dr_Willis	can I put "screen rtorrent&" before the last line and it'll work?
2010-08-26T16:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eino	 proberly. Try it and see..
2010-08-26T16:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eino	 you mey need to read up on the screen docs.
2010-08-26T16:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eino	 then you need to use a proper command and read up on screen
2010-08-26T16:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eino	 figure out how to do it from a  terminal. i do Not think 'screen whatever' runs whatever in screen.. try it from a terminal
2010-08-26T16:41:00.000Z	eino	Dr_Willis	if I type screen rtorrent its starts up fine
2010-08-26T16:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eino	 then whats the issue?
2010-08-26T16:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eino	 whats the exact command you put in rc.local ?
2010-08-26T16:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eino	 there ya go.. thats the issue
2010-08-26T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eino	 you do realize that  rc.lcoal is getting ran as root.. so your torrent app is getting ran as root. this may not be what you want
2010-08-26T16:47:00.000Z	eino	Dr_Willis	it doesn't matter if it runs as root
2010-08-26T16:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eino	 it can matter.. its a serucity risk
2010-08-26T16:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eino	 screen  has command line options to start detached.. you proberly need to use
