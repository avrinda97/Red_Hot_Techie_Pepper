2006-11-07T16:26:00.000Z	visik7		how can I add a feature or a patch to a kernel and increase its version ?
2006-11-07T16:26:00.000Z	visik7		from -10 ro -11
2006-11-07T16:26:00.000Z	visik7		to
2006-11-07T16:27:00.000Z	gyaresu	visik7	Firstly, do you NEED the patch?
2006-11-07T16:27:00.000Z	visik7	gyaresu	yes
2006-11-07T16:28:00.000Z	gyaresu	visik7	then i think howtoforge has a good link. *looking now
2006-11-07T16:28:00.000Z	gyaresu	visik7	http://www.howtoforge.com/kernel_compilation_ubuntu
2006-11-07T16:28:00.000Z	visik7	gyaresu	no the howtoforge broke all restricted gone with that howto
2006-11-07T16:28:00.000Z	visik7		that howto sucks
2006-11-07T16:28:00.000Z	gyaresu	visik7	sorry. that's annoying then.
2006-11-07T16:29:00.000Z	visik7	gyaresu	I just need to know where to set -11 instead of -10
2006-11-07T16:29:00.000Z	gyaresu	visik7	what device/feature is it for?
2006-11-07T16:29:00.000Z	gyaresu	visik7	oh. in the Makefile
2006-11-07T16:29:00.000Z	visik7	gyaresu	thanks
2006-11-07T16:30:00.000Z	gyaresu	visik7	wait one (i'm gentoo last 3 years. i'll just see if that's right.)
2006-11-07T16:30:00.000Z	visik7	gyaresu	mmm seems not
2006-11-07T16:31:00.000Z	gyaresu	visik7	yeah. just change EXTRAVERSION; but don't leave any spare hyphens dagging off the end.
2006-11-07T16:31:00.000Z	gyaresu	visik7	do you have the actual kernel source?
2006-11-07T16:31:00.000Z	visik7		extraversion is set to .13-ubuntu1 and it's replaced somewhere
2006-11-07T16:31:00.000Z	visik7		'couse the extraversion is -10-generic
2006-11-07T16:33:00.000Z	gyaresu	visik7	what do you mean it's set to ".13-ubuntu1"
2006-11-07T16:33:00.000Z	visik7	gyaresu	nevermind
