2007-06-10T05:55:00.000Z	TMM	omegacenti	bad advice, there might be a lot of noise, and that might be 2 times a minute... good way to get banned
2007-06-10T05:55:00.000Z	omegacenti	TMM	I apologize, could you help me improve that advice then? What is appropriate?
2007-06-10T05:55:00.000Z	TMM	omegacenti	'once every 20 minutes' is acceptable I think
2007-06-10T05:55:00.000Z	omegacenti	TMM	20 minutes?!
2007-06-10T05:56:00.000Z	TMM	omegacenti	yeah, you'll just annoy people if you ask the question too many times, people might be too busy or simple don't know. if you ask too often people who don't know the answer will have read the question 20 times, and people who DO know the answer will get annoyed
2007-06-10T05:57:00.000Z	omegacenti	TMM	However, I find it usually works when I ask the question on the out of sight out of mind method. when I no longer see the question and ask, it often gets addressed. I will try and do it less often in the future.
2007-06-10T05:58:00.000Z	TMM	omegacenti	good :) annoying the people that are supposed to help you is generally a bad idea :P
2007-06-10T05:58:00.000Z	omegacenti	TMM	I know. Thankyou very much for your advice. I will consider it :)
2007-06-10T05:59:00.000Z	TMM	omegacenti	ndiswrapper is only userful for network cards which do not have a native linux driver :)
2007-06-10T06:00:00.000Z	omegacenti	TMM	Hmm. Well than might you address Herosblade's situation with his external not installing and his supported network card not working under ubuntu?
2007-06-10T06:01:00.000Z	omegacenti	TMM	His network card is a netgear wg311v2 and is trying to install on an external harddrive
2007-06-10T06:03:00.000Z	omegacenti	TMM	What is acx100?
2007-06-10T06:04:00.000Z	omegacenti	TMM	ah. Thanks again :)
2007-06-10T06:04:00.000Z	omegacenti	TMM	very informative.
2007-06-10T06:05:00.000Z	omegacenti	TMM	I think his problem with the desktop one is that it wont allow him to choose where to install grub and it messed up hiw MBR enough that wg311v2e had to fix it in windows.
2007-06-10T06:05:00.000Z	omegacenti	TMM	weird, replace wg11v2e with Herosblade :)
2007-06-10T06:06:00.000Z	TMM	omegacenti	Herosblade: I believe that if you press 'advanced' at the last screen of the installer it'll allow you to choose where to install grub
2007-06-10T06:16:00.000Z	TMM	omegacenti	ghe, I would hope so
2007-06-10T06:18:00.000Z	TMM	omegacenti	ubuntu is .deb based, all software initially on ubuntu is installed through .deb files
2007-06-10T06:19:00.000Z	omegacenti	TMM	so you think this guide will still be compatible with my expereince on ubuntu?
2007-06-10T06:20:00.000Z	TMM	omegacenti	you can never have too much knowledge, there's only one way to go from n00b to 1337 :) that is time, and fixing fuckups :P
2007-06-10T06:21:00.000Z	omegacenti	TMM	 lol :) I will try and keep that in mind :)
