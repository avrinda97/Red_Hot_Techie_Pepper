2012-07-25T05:33:00.000Z	xmltok		is anyone familiar with netinstalls and selecting something other than eth0 based on mac address? I've found a few bugs and reportedly its fixed, but it does not work for me on 12.04 LTS
2012-07-25T05:34:00.000Z	fishbait	xmltok	1 question are you using a realtek nic?
2012-07-25T05:34:00.000Z	xmltok		no, not realtek
2012-07-25T05:35:00.000Z	xmltok		the interfaces appear but only one of them is wired up, the one which gets dhcp. once the kernel boots that is eth1 but 'auto' only checks eth0
2012-07-25T05:35:00.000Z	xmltok		both interfaces appear offline, even though eth1 is connected
2012-07-25T05:35:00.000Z	xmltok		if i run dhcp manually it configures fine
2012-07-25T05:35:00.000Z	fishbait	xmltok	hmm
2012-07-25T05:36:00.000Z	fishbait		do you have to do that on all machines?
2012-07-25T05:37:00.000Z	xmltok		aha. foudn the patch in http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=615600. it appears he looks for bootif to be set to the mac like AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF when the spec says 01-AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF, lets try it out..
2012-07-25T05:37:00.000Z	fishbait	xmltok	do you have to do that on all machines?
2012-07-25T05:37:00.000Z	xmltok		im not sure, i am only tryign with one machine of a certain class. its probably random on the ordering
2012-07-25T05:38:00.000Z	fishbait		i tihnk its just not seeing it fast enough
2012-07-25T05:39:00.000Z	fishbait		eth0 then eth1 it probably checks like that but
2012-07-25T05:39:00.000Z	xmltok		+            for (subst = bootif; *subst; subst++)
2012-07-25T05:39:00.000Z	xmltok		+                if (*subst == '-')
2012-07-25T05:39:00.000Z	xmltok		+                    *subst = ':';
2012-07-25T05:39:00.000Z	xmltok		i'm beginning to wonder if this patch made it into 12.04
2012-07-25T05:39:00.000Z	fishbait	xmltok	eth0 then eth1 it probably checks like that but
2012-07-25T05:39:00.000Z	xmltok		it doesn't actually check eth1 t
2012-07-25T05:39:00.000Z	fishbait		ahh even worse i'm out of ideas
2012-07-25T05:41:00.000Z	xmltok		i probably have to build my own initramfs
2012-07-25T05:50:00.000Z	xmltok	fishbait	my dhcp server was providing 'bootif' not 'BOOTIF'...
