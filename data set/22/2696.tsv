2009-05-13T08:19:00.000Z	myk_robinson1		how do i determine what module is running the bluetooth in my laptop? I want to disable it so as not to consume so much battery power
2009-05-13T08:19:00.000Z	pangloss	myk_robinson1	just disable bluetooth from startup programs
2009-05-13T08:20:00.000Z	myk_robinson1	pangloss	will that actually disable the device, or just the applet for the taskbar?
2009-05-13T08:20:00.000Z	pangloss	myk_robinson1	it will cause bluetooth to not startup on boot
2009-05-13T08:21:00.000Z	myk_robinson1	pangloss	thank you. Do you think I will see any significant change in battery use?
2009-05-13T08:21:00.000Z	pangloss		!bluetooth
2009-05-13T08:22:00.000Z	pangloss	myk_robinson1	it depends, bluetooth is a low-power protocol so probably not by much
2009-05-13T08:22:00.000Z	pangloss	myk_robinson1	you're probably better off just lowering your LCD brightness until you cant see the screen any more =)
2009-05-13T08:23:00.000Z	myk_robinson1	pangloss	got it lowered now. Does disabling desktop efects make a diff?
2009-05-13T08:23:00.000Z	myk_robinson1	pangloss	I think it may be this damn AMD Turion X2 64 cpu. Fan never stops running..It does stay cool though
2009-05-13T08:23:00.000Z	pangloss	myk_robinson1	well sure, anythign that causes your cpu to be used less will save you battery life
2009-05-13T08:24:00.000Z	pangloss	myk_robinson1	the big killers are the LCD screen and the programs you run
2009-05-13T08:24:00.000Z	myk_robinson1	pangloss	running it at 800MHz doesnt seem to change it. I think this laptop performs about the same running Windows. I guess its just a power hungry laptop. HP dv2310us
2009-05-13T08:24:00.000Z	myk_robinson1	pangloss	perhaps my solution is just to buy a 12 cell battery
2009-05-13T08:25:00.000Z	pangloss	myk_robinson1	the battery could just be dying
2009-05-13T08:25:00.000Z	pangloss	myk_robinson1	you would probably be better off, and get more functionality out of your laptop
2009-05-13T08:25:00.000Z	myk_robinson1	pangloss	its relatively new, about a year old. I got it used yesterday and repaired it
2009-05-13T08:25:00.000Z	myk_robinson1		nice laptop, just the battery life sucks
2009-05-13T08:26:00.000Z	pangloss	myk_robinson1	my girlfriends laptop ate 3 batteries in her first two years of owning it. Those HPs get so damn hot
2009-05-13T08:26:00.000Z	pangloss	myk_robinson1	heat is another real killer of battery life
2009-05-13T08:26:00.000Z	myk_robinson1	pangloss	I thought about a laptop chill pad, but that would just eat more battery to power it
2009-05-13T08:27:00.000Z	myk_robinson1	pangloss	I thought about buy a laptop cooler, but that would just eat more battery to power it through the USB bus
