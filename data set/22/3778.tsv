2008-05-31T01:27:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		Hmm, quick question: IF I compile a deb on HedgeHog will it work on Heron, or vice versa?
2008-05-31T01:27:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		anyone know?
2008-05-31T01:28:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		ok thnx
2008-05-31T01:29:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		Other thing, how do I compile things without internet access? Or could some one do it...
2008-05-31T01:30:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		it's my modem driver...
2008-05-31T01:30:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Gaming4JC	you'll need to use another computer with net access to download build-essential and its dependencies from http://packages.ubuntu.com
2008-05-31T02:41:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Gaming4JC	usually a matter of installing build-essential, then reading the readme or install files
2008-05-31T03:35:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Starnestommy	It's extremely easy to compile "if" you have an internet connection. Could some one do it for me who has internet connection. :)
2008-05-31T03:36:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Gaming4JC	just use another computer to put the .deb packages for build-essential and its dependencies on a disc to transfer the packages to the one without the internet connection.  YOu can get the packages from http://packages.ubuntu.com
2008-05-31T03:37:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Starnestommy	Where can I get the packages for "hedgehog"?
2008-05-31T03:37:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Gaming4JC	hedgehog?
2008-05-31T03:38:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Starnestommy	The original ubuntu. O_o
2008-06-01T07:53:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Gaming4JC	why can't you compile it yourself?
2008-06-01T07:55:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Starnestommy	I can't compile it since the compiler tool is online. (When I get hardy I'll download the compilers from the site). But the run command for getting it off the cd doesn't exist. It just says downloading and then "can't connect". :s
2008-06-01T07:55:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Gaming4JC	check http://packages.ubuntu.com
2008-06-01T07:56:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Starnestommy	I wanted to test it for Hoary while Hary's in the mail. (Hoary is discontinued)
2008-06-01T08:27:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Gaming4JC	wine has partial Direct3D support.  Windows games that use OpenGL work almost perfectly
2008-06-07T03:20:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Starnestommy	Is there a way to install packages from my Ubuntu CD?
2008-06-07T03:25:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Gaming4JC	for that first one, what kind of connection do you have and did you recently download a lot on it?
2008-06-07T03:26:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Starnestommy	External Dial-Up modem. No I didn't download much and it's fast on WinXP. But not on Ubuntu.
2008-06-21T17:45:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Starnestommy	Would you remeber what that site was that had an autodetect driver for Lucent Winmodem's? I think the comapny started with a C... they had Lucent in their name and a driver which cost money/
2008-06-21T17:45:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Gaming4JC	I don't think so
