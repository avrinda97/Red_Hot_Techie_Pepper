2008-01-21T09:19:00.000Z	Daworm		!ftpserver
2008-01-21T09:19:00.000Z	Daworm		what's a good ftp server someone?
2008-01-21T09:20:00.000Z	Daworm		thanks
2008-01-21T09:20:00.000Z	Daworm		wanting a nice light ftp server, which would have smallest simplest footprint nickrud?
2008-01-21T09:20:00.000Z	nickrud	Daworm	not sure, to be honest.
2008-01-21T09:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Daworm	turn off the gui? if you're doing nothing with the gui, log into clt-alt-f1 and run sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop  run it with start to resume
2008-01-21T09:36:00.000Z	nickrud	Daworm	in the repos it's   subversion
2008-01-21T09:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Daworm	system->admin->software sources, make sure the first four are enabled
2008-01-21T09:38:00.000Z	Daworm	nickrud	- I turned off the GUI interface :P
2008-01-21T09:38:00.000Z	nickrud	Daworm	in /etc/apt/sources.list , make sure the main repo is enabled (no # at the beginning of the line)
2008-01-21T09:39:00.000Z	nickrud	Daworm	yes
2008-01-21T09:40:00.000Z	nickrud	Daworm	you probably want to enable the universe & multiverse ones as well. In fact, you should probably turn on the gui long enough to run the software sources to make sure its set up to get updates and security
2008-01-21T09:40:00.000Z	Daworm	nickrud	- how long for?
2008-01-21T09:41:00.000Z	nickrud	Daworm	just long enough to run system->admin->software sources , enable the first four on the first tab and security and updates on the (third?) tab
2008-01-21T09:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Daworm	the settings I'm talking about determines what apt-get update gets, and what apt-get upgrade will install
2008-01-21T09:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Daworm	sudo invoke-rc.d gdm start
2008-01-21T09:43:00.000Z	Daworm	nickrud	done that . but still sitting at command prompt. Reboot?
2008-01-21T09:43:00.000Z	nickrud	Daworm	ctl-alt-f7 , do you see the gui login?
2008-01-21T09:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Daworm	lol, ok make sure the first four are enabled, and at least the gutsy-security on the updates tab
2008-01-21T09:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Daworm	your choice, some do, some don't. I don't
