2006-04-14T15:41:00.000Z	mwe	sovieticool	no
2006-04-14T13:37:00.000Z	mwe	sovieticool	breezy is newer so I'd go with that
2006-04-14T14:21:00.000Z	mwe	sovieticool	right click desktop, look at the menu
2006-04-14T15:41:00.000Z	sovieticool	mwe	sudo shutdown -h 3 is good for 3 hours ?
2006-04-14T15:42:00.000Z	mwe	sovieticool	sudo shutdown -h +minutes or sudo shutdown -h absolute time
2006-04-14T15:42:00.000Z	mwe	sovieticool	like sudo shutdown -h 00:30
2006-04-14T15:43:00.000Z	mwe	sovieticool	no
2006-04-14T15:44:00.000Z	mwe	sovieticool	the -h XX:YY is a time of the day like 12:00 for noon
2006-04-14T15:44:00.000Z	mwe	sovieticool	+X is X minutes from now
2006-04-14T15:46:00.000Z	mwe	sovieticool	heh
2006-04-14T15:47:00.000Z	mwe	sovieticool	actually 3:00 should be sufficient to shutdown a 3 am, the firs 0 is not needed like in 03:00
2006-04-14T15:48:00.000Z	mwe	sovieticool	yw
2006-04-15T14:52:00.000Z	mwe	sovieticool	your should probably install it again and also sudo dpkg-divert --remove /usr/bin/firefox to get rid of the diversion if you followed the wiki
2006-04-15T14:55:00.000Z	mwe	sovieticool	lots of things in ubuntu is relying on firefox. removing it is a bad idea
2006-04-15T14:55:00.000Z	mwe	sovieticool	the gecko engine is needed
2006-04-15T15:21:00.000Z	mwe	sovieticool	how is it not woriking? it doesn't install or flash is not working?
