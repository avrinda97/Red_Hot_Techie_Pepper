2008-07-04T15:08:00.000Z	ng0L_	DistroJockey	yes :)
2008-07-04T15:08:00.000Z	ng0L_	DistroJockey	I cannot get my browser work
2008-07-04T15:09:00.000Z	ng0L_	DistroJockey	I don't think it is because of my ISP or those browser, but the Ubuntu is the main problem.
2008-07-04T15:09:00.000Z	ng0L_	DistroJockey	Yes hehehe damn fine:D
2008-07-04T15:10:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ng0L_	proxy setting in your browser maybe?
2008-07-04T15:11:00.000Z	ng0L_	DistroJockey	 Nope
2008-07-04T15:12:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ng0L_	bad or no DNS server entry maybe?
2008-07-04T15:12:00.000Z	ng0L_	DistroJockey	also not
2008-07-04T15:12:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ng0L_	out of ideas atm sorry :(
2008-07-04T15:13:00.000Z	ng0L_	DistroJockey	I've been here for 2 days now and none could solve.
2008-07-04T15:14:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ng0L_	yeah, it looks to be a tricky one
2008-07-04T15:14:00.000Z	ng0L_	DistroJockey	:| if firefox is suck then another browser would work right? but all is the same
2008-07-04T15:15:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ng0L_	the only thing I can think of that would do that is a firewall blocking port 80
2008-07-04T15:15:00.000Z	ng0L_	DistroJockey	I might need to uninstall every applications are installed.
2008-07-04T15:16:00.000Z	ng0L_	DistroJockey	If it is blocked, i wouldnt use firefox to download the file, if i know exactly the link.
2008-07-04T15:16:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ng0L_	true
2008-07-04T15:17:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ng0L_	that's why I mentioned DNS. Very odd
2008-07-04T15:17:00.000Z	ng0L_	DistroJockey	if DNS is wrong i think i cannot even be here.
2008-07-04T15:18:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ng0L_	depends if you use name.host or 111.111.111.111 for e.g.
2008-07-04T15:19:00.000Z	ng0L_	DistroJockey	 i see.
