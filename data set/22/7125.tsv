2006-06-02T08:05:00.000Z	lufis		Is there any hope for running XGL/Compiz on a crappy, onboard video card?
2006-06-02T08:05:00.000Z	skippy81	lufis	not really
2006-06-02T08:06:00.000Z	lufis	skippy81	It is Intel, indeed, but I have no idea how to enable it. I tried running 3ddesktop and it wouldn't work
2006-06-02T08:08:00.000Z	lufis	skippy81	It's an Intel 82845g... pretty generic onboard graphics chip; Warbo: Hmmm, thanks
2006-06-02T08:17:00.000Z	skippy81	lufis	yes i will walk you through
2006-06-02T08:22:00.000Z	lufis	skippy81	Sure
2006-06-02T08:18:00.000Z	lufis	skippy81	Thanks!
2006-06-02T08:18:00.000Z	skippy81	lufis	1) "sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorgbackup.conf"
2006-06-02T08:18:00.000Z	skippy81	lufis	2) "sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
2006-06-02T08:20:00.000Z	lufis	skippy81	Alright, done :)
2006-06-02T08:20:00.000Z	skippy81	lufis	3) look for a line in the device section it will probably say:  "Device"    "vesa"
2006-06-02T08:21:00.000Z	lufis	skippy81	I'm not seeing the "vesa" part
2006-06-02T08:23:00.000Z	lufis	skippy81	http://pastebin.com/752683
2006-06-02T08:24:00.000Z	skippy81	lufis	you allready got the driver running :) so that should save us a bit of time
2006-06-02T08:24:00.000Z	lufis	skippy81	Ok, cool
2006-06-02T08:25:00.000Z	lufis	skippy81	Ok
2006-06-02T08:27:00.000Z	lufis	skippy81	Cool, thank you so much
2006-06-02T08:32:00.000Z	skippy81	lufis	it has occured to me that with an intel graphics card you could go for aiglx/compiz rather than xgl/compiz - aiglx looks like it will actually be better and may run smoother on your PC
2006-06-02T08:32:00.000Z	skippy81	lufis	here is the aiglx guide from forums http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=145068&highlight=xgl+compiz
2006-06-02T08:32:00.000Z	lufis	skippy81	Hm... thanks!
2006-06-02T08:33:00.000Z	skippy81	lufis	and here is a guide for the standard xgl/compiz setup http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=133772
2006-06-02T08:33:00.000Z	lufis	skippy81	Great, thanks so much :)
