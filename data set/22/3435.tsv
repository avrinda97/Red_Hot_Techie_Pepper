2008-09-05T20:43:00.000Z	blazerrr	usser	does anybody knows how could i just copy directoryes that their size is diferrent than cero ??
2008-09-05T20:43:00.000Z	usser	blazerrr	oh try cp -R dir1/ newname/
2008-09-05T20:43:00.000Z	blazerrr	usser	but i want it to copy just the folders with contents
2008-09-05T20:44:00.000Z	usser	blazerrr	that will do it: cp -R oldfolder/ newfolder/
2008-09-05T20:44:00.000Z	blazerrr	usser	and also i want it to copy just folders not any file
2008-09-05T20:45:00.000Z	blazerrr	usser	i mean... to copy the folders with content, and not to copy any file that is without folder
2008-09-05T20:45:00.000Z	usser	blazerrr	oh u want to just copy directory structure?
2008-09-05T20:46:00.000Z	usser	blazerrr	i see yes you have to use find command. I dont really know how to use it myself so i cant help u with that
2008-09-05T20:47:00.000Z	usser	blazerrr	hang on
2008-09-05T20:48:00.000Z	usser	blazerrr	hang on
2008-09-05T20:49:00.000Z	blazerrr	usser	ok =)
2008-09-05T20:50:00.000Z	usser	blazerrr	i'll write a simple script give me some time
2008-09-05T20:51:00.000Z	blazerrr	usser	all right thank you very much, im also reading find man page
2008-09-05T20:52:00.000Z	usser	blazerrr	bah actually script is not the right solution since it has to go recursively thru directoies etc use find
2008-09-05T20:53:00.000Z	blazerrr	usser	so what is the right solution?
2008-09-05T20:54:00.000Z	usser	blazerrr	the find command that erUSUL gave u looks right but its missing an exec part where it actually copies the directories
2008-09-05T20:55:00.000Z	blazerrr	usser	erUSUL is running guys...
2008-09-05T20:57:00.000Z	blazerrr	usser	erUSUL all right!!! the folders are being listed!, is there any way to see the column size?? just in case to be sure about the size?? because just folder name is being listed
