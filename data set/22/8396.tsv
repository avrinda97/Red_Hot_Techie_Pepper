2005-08-25T15:31:00.000Z	BTJustice		I had a Creative SB Live! 7.1 sound card, but it gave me so many problems that I got rid of it.  I just put my old Creative SB Live! 5.1 sound card back in.  What do I need to do to get it to work in Kubuntu?
2005-08-25T15:31:00.000Z	Liquidfire	BTJustice	 you need to set alsamixer
2005-08-25T15:32:00.000Z	BTJustice	Liquidfire	If I type 'alsamixer' I get nothing.
2005-08-25T15:32:00.000Z	Liquidfire		open your terminal BTJustice and type alsamixer
