2007-01-31T16:26:00.000Z	krang	`Penumbra	open up nero and under one of the menus there should be a "burn ISO image" option.
2007-01-31T16:26:00.000Z	krang	`Penumbra	Just look all over it for the keywords "burn ISO"
2007-01-31T16:26:00.000Z	krang	`Penumbra	when you see them, click on them :-)
2007-01-31T16:27:00.000Z	krang	`Penumbra	hit that yo!

2007-01-31T16:30:00.000Z	krang	`Penumbra	yeah, that's important, just open "Synaptic package manager" from system->administration and search for xchat. We'll get you from there :-D
