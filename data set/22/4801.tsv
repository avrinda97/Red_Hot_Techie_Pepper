2007-10-05T15:16:00.000Z	Renderbox		I need help installing my WiFi card
2007-10-05T15:17:00.000Z	it-linux	Renderbox	| what tpye do you have?
2007-10-05T15:18:00.000Z	Renderbox	it-linux	Intel Pro 6945 AGN (I THINK thats the number... I only know how to check it in Windows)
2007-10-05T15:19:00.000Z	it-linux	Renderbox	is it PCI? USB? or onboard?
2007-10-05T15:19:00.000Z	Renderbox	it-linux	on board I guess. Its a laptop
2007-10-05T15:21:00.000Z	Renderbox	it-linux	I checked but I don't know which one is it. I tried lspci, and there's an "unknown device" by Intel Corporation, under Network controller
2007-10-05T15:22:00.000Z	Renderbox	it-linux	With my previous installation yesterday, I typed some command that I got from a forum, and it downloaded something from sourceforge, and my card was listed correctly after that...
2007-10-05T15:23:00.000Z	it-linux	Renderbox	| I'm gonna check it out first?
2007-10-05T15:24:00.000Z	it-linux	Renderbox	| without underscore
2007-10-05T15:30:00.000Z	Renderbox	it-linux	are you still here?
2007-10-05T15:35:00.000Z	it-linux	Renderbox	| yes ? I'm kind of busy, sorry
2007-10-05T15:41:00.000Z	Renderbox	it-linux	Yes but the WiFi light is off
2007-10-05T15:37:00.000Z	it-linux	Renderbox	| are you in hotspot?
2007-10-05T15:37:00.000Z	Renderbox	it-linux	No, I'm at home
2007-10-05T15:38:00.000Z	it-linux	Renderbox	| the parameter is the same way you configure like wired, but in hotspot, your card will searching automatically.
2007-10-05T15:39:00.000Z	Renderbox	it-linux	The card is not even configured
2007-10-05T15:40:00.000Z	it-linux	Renderbox	| is there a button in your laptop to turn your WiFi on?
2007-10-05T15:43:00.000Z	it-linux	Renderbox	| Or do you have wireless connection in your home?
2007-10-05T15:43:00.000Z	Renderbox	it-linux	Yeah obviously
2007-10-05T15:47:00.000Z	it-linux	Renderbox	| may I ask you again? Have you download Ubuntu 7.10 beta?
2007-10-05T15:50:00.000Z	Renderbox	it-linux	No, I'm using Fiesty Fawn 7.04
