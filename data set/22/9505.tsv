2010-01-02T19:37:00.000Z	g0tcha		does ubuntu have a firewall installed by default that might block port 1723?
2010-01-02T19:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	g0tcha	 thers are no default firewall rules to block anuything
2010-01-02T19:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	g0tcha	 check with sudo iptables -L (or was it --list)  to see all rules
2010-01-02T19:39:00.000Z	g0tcha	Dr_Willis	it comes out empty with nothing listed
2010-01-02T19:39:00.000Z	g0tcha	Dr_Willis	i guess my isp is blocking port 1723 then because i portforward it to my ubuntu and still shows as blocked
2010-10-10T16:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	g0tcha	 it starts installing.. then asks quetions. :)
2010-10-10T16:17:00.000Z	g0tcha	Dr_Willis	thats very nice
2010-11-15T17:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	g0tcha	 'wubi' is a feature/tool on the cd tht installs to a file 'inside' windows.
2010-11-15T17:16:00.000Z	g0tcha	Dr_Willis	its a feature inside the ubuntu cd?
2010-11-15T17:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	g0tcha	 'wubi.exe' is included on the cd.. or you can download wubi.exe and it will download a cd/iso file.
2010-11-15T17:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	g0tcha	 i dont reccomend  Wubi.
2010-11-15T17:16:00.000Z	g0tcha	Dr_Willis	why not? just curious
2010-11-15T17:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	g0tcha	 it has a tendency to break badly. (but thats from someone that sits in here all day and SEES people come in with wubi issues)
2010-11-15T17:17:00.000Z	g0tcha	Dr_Willis	ah i see.. hmm
2010-11-15T17:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	g0tcha	 if you want to 'test' out ubuntu, i would suggest trying it in virtualbox.  or doing a normal install.
2010-11-15T17:18:00.000Z	g0tcha	Dr_Willis	actually i wanted to try wubi itself.. but if it does have alot of issues, i might just stick with a vm
2010-11-15T17:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	g0tcha	 there sproberly 4+ people a day in here with wubi issues.. that basically no one in here really knows the proper ways to 'fix' :)
2010-11-15T17:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	g0tcha	 since most of us DONT use wubi.
2010-11-15T17:19:00.000Z	g0tcha	Dr_Willis	yeah tahts understandable.. but from what you see, do you remember if the majority have the same kind of issues? or different
2010-11-15T17:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	g0tcha	 things like 'updated grub.. wubi dont boot, now what...' ive no idea how to proeprly fix grub on wubi. :)
2010-11-15T17:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	g0tcha	 or windows updated and breaks somthing.
2010-11-15T17:20:00.000Z	g0tcha	Dr_Willis	haha
