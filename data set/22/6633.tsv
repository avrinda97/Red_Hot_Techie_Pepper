2006-10-22T10:16:00.000Z	tsoler		thanks god there is ubuntu then
2006-10-22T10:17:00.000Z	tsoler		but there is still an issue of transition
2006-10-22T10:18:00.000Z	tsoler		all here are windows ex usures?
2006-10-22T10:19:00.000Z	tsoler		there is a need to write ntfs in order of  making the transition
2006-10-22T10:20:00.000Z	anon32	tsoler	currently, the best way to write to ntfs is with captive ntfs, but it's not very legal
2006-10-22T10:21:00.000Z	anon32	tsoler	it uses the Windows ntfs.sys to perform read/writes
2006-10-22T10:23:00.000Z	anon32	tsoler	format, install, finish
2006-10-22T10:24:00.000Z	anon32	tsoler	google for captive-ntfs, nobody follows the rules anyway
2006-10-22T10:25:00.000Z	anon32	tsoler	do you still need your Windows install?
2006-10-22T10:26:00.000Z	anon32	tsoler	that's not what I asked
2006-10-22T10:27:00.000Z	anon32	tsoler	you should try using a third partition to store your data, fat32 or ext2 can both have full support in Windows
2006-10-22T10:37:00.000Z	anon32	tsoler	FAT32
2006-10-22T10:48:00.000Z	anon32	tsoler	probably
2006-10-22T10:50:00.000Z	anon32	tsoler	yes (ext2 though, ext3 has issues with Windows)
2006-10-22T11:00:00.000Z	anon32	tsoler	there are no issues with reading, only writing to ext3 with journal
2006-10-22T11:03:00.000Z	anon32	tsoler	no matter how much you bitch to us, our answer's not gonna change
