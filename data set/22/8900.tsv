2005-05-27T12:49:00.000Z	JosephSpiros		So, I'm running Hoary, and I just installed VLC
2005-05-27T12:49:00.000Z	JosephSpiros		and I'm sure the answer is staring me in the face
2005-05-27T12:49:00.000Z	JosephSpiros		But, erm, how do I get sound working?
2005-05-27T12:50:00.000Z	JosephSpiros		It complains about /dev/dsp not working
2005-05-27T12:50:00.000Z	nickrud	JosephSpiros	you probably need vlc-esd or some such
2005-05-27T12:51:00.000Z	JosephSpiros	nickrud	yeah, vlc-plugin-esd looks like what I need
2005-06-19T13:05:00.000Z	nickrud	JosephSpiros	us has been broke for a day or two, good question
2005-08-09T09:49:00.000Z	nickrud	JosephSpiros	I wish I had your problem
2005-08-09T09:49:00.000Z	JosephSpiros	nickrud	;p
2005-08-09T09:50:00.000Z	nickrud	JosephSpiros	look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log, it may have more info
2005-08-09T09:53:00.000Z	nickrud	JosephSpiros	sorry, i didn't catch the powerpc thing, I will be of no help
2005-08-09T09:53:00.000Z	JosephSpiros	nickrud	the log goes on as if it worked fine , printing like "(--) NV(0): Chipset: "GeForce4 MX 440" and whatnot that leads me to believe it should work fine
2005-08-09T09:54:00.000Z	JosephSpiros	nickrud	until it hits "(EE) Unable to find a valid framebuffer device" and dies
2005-08-09T09:54:00.000Z	nickrud	JosephSpiros	thru experience, my i86 experience has no relevance to power pc
2005-08-09T09:54:00.000Z	JosephSpiros	nickrud	no warnings or errors prior to that except for being unable to find fb3-fb7
2005-08-09T09:54:00.000Z	JosephSpiros	nickrud	Oh well
2005-08-09T09:58:00.000Z	nickrud	JosephSpiros	some powerpc people drop in and out; ask again later
2005-08-09T09:58:00.000Z	JosephSpiros	nickrud	thing is, I don't think it's a PowerPC problem
2005-08-09T09:59:00.000Z	JosephSpiros	nickrud	I think it's a "having three displays that while the kernel framebuffer sees them, X apparently doesn't" problem
2005-08-09T10:01:00.000Z	JosephSpiros	nickrud	would the fact that two of them share a driver help?
2005-08-09T10:01:00.000Z	JosephSpiros	nickrud	;p
2005-08-09T10:01:00.000Z	nickrud	JosephSpiros	if I'd used those cards, maybe
