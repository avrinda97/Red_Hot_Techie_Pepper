2009-04-30T13:13:00.000Z	ripps	uriel_	Ranakah: if your using older ati cards in ubuntu, your cards aren't going to work. Only the latest catalyst driver (9.4) works with Jaunty's xserver, and 9.4 also diable support for r500 and lower cards.
2009-04-30T13:24:00.000Z	ripps	uriel_	no
2009-04-30T13:25:00.000Z	ripps	uriel_	tell me what your card is "lspci |grep VGA"
2009-04-30T13:27:00.000Z	ripps	uriel_	"lspci |grep VGA" copy that into a terminal and tell me what the output is.
2009-04-30T13:28:00.000Z	ripps	uriel_	Your card is a r420, that means that the proprietary driver doesn't work with your card anymore, AMD discontinued support. You have to use the opensource radeon driver. Your probably already using it.
2009-04-30T13:30:00.000Z	ripps	uriel_	Your probably already using it, type "glxinfo |grep renderer" and tell us what the output is.
2009-04-30T13:32:00.000Z	ripps	uriel_	That's it, your using the radeon driver. There's nothing left you can do, if you want to pull a little more performance to your drive try adding 'Option "AccelDFS" "True"' to your xorg.conf
2009-04-30T13:34:00.000Z	ripps	uriel_	AccelDFS will only speed up Flash if your having issues with it, if not, it's best to leave it alone
2009-04-30T13:35:00.000Z	ripps	uriel_	sadly, no. Ther isn't anything you can do about that. Hopefully by next year, the opensource radeon driver will be using a new 3d rendering architecture that should increase performance, but until then your stuck with this.
2009-04-30T13:50:00.000Z	ripps	uriel_	no, you'll have to reinstall
2009-04-30T13:51:00.000Z	ripps	uriel_	next time, before upgrading download a livecd and see if anything doesn't work anymore.
2009-04-30T13:53:00.000Z	ripps	uriel_	probably none, seeing as the drop of cars was to increase focus on fixing bugs for the HD and newer line of cards
