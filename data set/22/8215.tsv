2006-10-03T05:17:00.000Z	ardchoille	variant	(sudo) chown -R yourusername:yourusername /mnt/hdd
2006-10-03T05:17:00.000Z	variant	ardchoille	thats what i said
2006-10-03T05:18:00.000Z	variant	ardchoille	run it as root (using sudo) i should have said perhaps
2006-10-03T05:18:00.000Z	ardchoille	variant	Your command only had "yourusername" once, you eed it twice, separated by a colon
2006-10-03T05:18:00.000Z	variant	ardchoille	no you dont
2006-10-03T05:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	variant	ok, well on mine, it gives an error if you don't
2006-10-03T05:20:00.000Z	variant	ardchoille	the bit after the colon is the group
2006-10-03T05:20:00.000Z	variant	ardchoille	but is not required
2006-10-03T05:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	variant	Ah, I'm going on info I learned years ago when I got an error, seems no error is shown now.. must have been an update to chown since then. Thanks for the headsup :)
2007-02-14T13:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	variant	Don't feed the trolls ;)
2007-02-14T13:46:00.000Z	variant	ardchoille	he is on /ignore now anyway :)
2007-02-14T13:46:00.000Z	ardchoille	variant	I just added him to mine too
2007-02-15T13:07:00.000Z	ardchoille	variant	He'll need the proper syntax to enter into viduso
2007-03-22T10:00:00.000Z	ardchoille	variant	Feisty is supposed to release on the 19th of next month. Has that changed?
2007-03-22T10:00:00.000Z	variant	ardchoille	not as far as i know
2007-03-24T15:17:00.000Z	variant	ardchoille	with beryl?
2007-03-24T15:18:00.000Z	ardchoille	variant	No, just Firefox on Dapper
2007-03-24T15:18:00.000Z	variant	ardchoille	well, is it every site?
2007-03-24T15:18:00.000Z	ardchoille	variant	All the ones I have visited that have a drop down menu.
