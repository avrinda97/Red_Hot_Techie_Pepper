2009-02-25T21:37:00.000Z	glitsj16	gordonjcp	using UUID's isn't that hard, they rarely change anyway ... to find those, run "sudo blkid"
2009-02-25T21:39:00.000Z	glitsj16	gordonjcp	run sudo blkid to find those UUID's
2009-02-25T21:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	glitsj16	it only returns /dev/sda1's UUID
2009-02-25T21:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	glitsj16	what happens when I create new partitions, then?
2009-02-25T21:40:00.000Z	glitsj16	gordonjcp	are your other partitions/drives unmounted perhaps ?
2009-02-25T21:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	glitsj16	yes, of course they're unmounted
2009-02-25T21:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	glitsj16	there's no UUID
2009-02-25T21:41:00.000Z	glitsj16	gordonjcp	new partitions get a new UUID, track those down with sudo blkid and add them to /etc/fstab
2009-02-25T21:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	glitsj16	I just told you, sudo blkid only returns a UUID for /dev/sda1
2009-02-25T21:42:00.000Z	glitsj16	gordonjcp	i saw that, no need to repeat
2009-02-25T21:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	glitsj16	ok, so what generates new UUIDs for new partitions?
2009-02-25T21:43:00.000Z	glitsj16	gordonjcp	did you try producing an /etc/fstab without UUID's ? i believe that should still work if you are so inclined
2009-02-25T21:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	glitsj16	I did, it threw an error
2009-02-25T21:46:00.000Z	glitsj16	gordonjcp	just checked the man for blkid, you can specify the device, i left that out, in which case the system reads info from /proc/partitions, so if you know the device names, you should be able to produce all needed UUID's
2009-02-25T21:57:00.000Z	glitsj16	gordonjcp	feed the sudo blkid the /dev/xxx of your swap and it will produce it's UUID
2009-02-25T21:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	glitsj16	nope
2009-02-25T21:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	glitsj16	again, doesn't work
2009-02-25T21:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	glitsj16	it doesn't return anything at all
2009-02-25T21:58:00.000Z	glitsj16	gordonjcp	odd indeed
2009-05-06T02:47:00.000Z	glitsj16	gordonjcp	i like gedit, but do you happen to know it does code folding ?
2009-05-06T02:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	glitsj16	not that I know of, but I expect you can configure it, or find a plugin
2009-05-06T02:48:00.000Z	glitsj16	gordonjcp	have looked around, but nothing yet, thanks
