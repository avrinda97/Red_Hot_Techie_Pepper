2008-06-01T00:18:00.000Z	derspankster	h4L1m	yes, thanks, but when I enable the restricted driver all I get upon reboot is a blank screen
2008-06-01T00:20:00.000Z	h4L1m	derspankster	do you have to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf file?
2008-06-01T00:21:00.000Z	h4L1m	derspankster	give me the name of the nvidia drivers you're trying to install
2008-06-01T00:21:00.000Z	derspankster	h4L1m	nvidia glx-new
2008-06-01T00:22:00.000Z	h4L1m	derspankster	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2008-06-01T00:22:00.000Z	derspankster	h4L1m	fresh install of Hardy
2008-06-01T00:22:00.000Z	derspankster	h4L1m	card is a geforce 6600
2008-06-01T00:24:00.000Z	h4L1m	derspankster	you tried to type "sudo nvidia-xconfig" ?
2008-06-01T00:24:00.000Z	h4L1m	derspankster	i think this is a config tool of nvidia's drivers
2008-06-01T00:24:00.000Z	derspankster	h4L1m	yes. Actually, system says that nvidia-glx-new is installed but when I try to enable is X fails and I have to fall back to nv
2008-06-01T00:26:00.000Z	h4L1m	derspankster	so sudo nvidia-xconfig doesn't help you, right?
2008-06-01T00:26:00.000Z	derspankster	h4L1m	an attempt to install nvidia config results in the uninstallation of nvidia-glx-new
2008-06-01T00:28:00.000Z	h4L1m	derspankster	why that? i think it has to come with the nvidia drivers
2008-06-01T00:28:00.000Z	derspankster	h4L1m	all I get from nvidia-xconfig is a warning about CorePointer not being specified explicitly
2008-06-01T00:30:00.000Z	derspankster	h4L1m	of course I have nvidia X server settings installed but it won't run because the driver can not be successfully enabled.
2008-06-01T00:32:00.000Z	derspankster	h4L1m	it's a merry-go-round to hell. Wish I would have stayed with Gutsy
2008-06-01T00:32:00.000Z	h4L1m	derspankster	i used hardy for a few days and changed back to gutsy :)
2008-06-01T00:32:00.000Z	h4L1m	derspankster	i'm sorry but i can't find something about this, please ask the channel
2008-06-01T00:33:00.000Z	derspankster	h4L1m	Hardy is without a doubt, the absolute worst release i have seen in the past two years. I do certainly appreciate your help though
2008-06-01T00:34:00.000Z	h4L1m	derspankster	you're welcome
