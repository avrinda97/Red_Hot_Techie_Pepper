2005-03-28T15:27:00.000Z	runedude		hi everyone, got a question, how can I uninstall X completely?
2005-03-28T15:27:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	yes.
2005-03-28T15:27:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	just uninstall all the X related packages.
2005-03-28T15:28:00.000Z	runedude	Blissex	is there like a main core x process tho?
2005-03-28T15:28:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	perhaps I sort of remember the whining :-)
2005-03-28T15:28:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	are your sort of more familiar with 'aptitude'>
2005-03-28T15:28:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	are your sort of more familiar with 'aptitude'?
2005-03-28T15:29:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	or 'synaptic'?
2005-03-28T15:29:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	there are two/three reasons fro using 'aptitude' or s'synaptic; here..
2005-03-28T15:29:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	they do the cache thing too a lot better.
2005-03-28T15:30:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	package lists, by topic, e.g. X, and lists of just installed packages, and the ability to see fboth forward and reverse dependencies.
2005-03-28T15:30:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	so you can get the ''umbrella'' X virtual package, see all its dependendencies, and just uninstall all those.
2005-03-28T15:37:00.000Z	runedude	Blissex	tried aptitude, wouldnt let me remove it tho ?
2005-03-28T15:40:00.000Z	runedude	Blissex	how can I first terminate X, tried killing its process , just boots again
2005-03-28T15:41:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	switch runlevel to runelvel 2
2005-03-28T15:42:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	or stop 'gdm' as zenrox says, but I suspect runlevel 2 is mote right.
2005-11-09T12:57:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	its the same for AMD and Intel 64 bit...
2005-11-09T12:58:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	if you are asking, it is not an Itanic...
2005-11-09T12:58:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	yes, and is the same as AMD64.
2005-11-09T12:59:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	it is almost identical, so the same binaries work on botjh, it just requires a tiny few changes in the kernel, and they both there.
2005-11-09T12:59:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	ideally yes...
2005-11-09T12:59:00.000Z	Blissex	runedude	unless the DVD drive is _really_ old.
