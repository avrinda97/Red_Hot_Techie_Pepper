2012-01-23T10:26:00.000Z	darkcrimson		Yeah. That's weird.
2012-01-23T10:26:00.000Z	darkcrimson		Only thing I could think of is random shortcut, or trying to open a document you wouldn't normally associate with LibreOffice.
2012-01-23T10:27:00.000Z	darkcrimson		That's so random.
2012-01-23T10:27:00.000Z	darkcrimson		I think your machine is haunted.
2012-01-23T10:29:00.000Z	darkcrimson		How about everytime you get a new email?
2012-01-23T10:30:00.000Z	oops	darkcrimson	I don't have empathy or thunderbird setup.
2012-01-23T10:30:00.000Z	darkcrimson	oops	Hmm...
2012-01-23T10:30:00.000Z	darkcrimson	oops	That is really odd. I'm going to stick with haunted.
2012-01-23T10:31:00.000Z	darkcrimson	oops	Time to call the short lady who says "This house is clean"
2012-01-23T10:31:00.000Z	darkcrimson	oops	I'm going to research this some.
2012-01-23T10:32:00.000Z	darkcrimson	oops	See if the process is running and kill it.
2012-01-23T10:38:00.000Z	darkcrimson	oops	I'm completely blank.
2012-01-23T10:38:00.000Z	oops	darkcrimson	I know, thats why I came here is cause it baffled me too.
2012-01-23T10:39:00.000Z	darkcrimson	oops	My only suggestion would be to remove it and try reinstalling.
2012-01-23T10:40:00.000Z	oops	darkcrimson	but thats the thing, It didn't start happening until I reinstalled yesterday. 0.o
2012-01-23T10:40:00.000Z	darkcrimson	oops	We found your problem.
2012-01-23T10:40:00.000Z	darkcrimson	oops	bad install.
2012-01-23T10:40:00.000Z	darkcrimson	oops	It could be possible you got some corrupt files in there.
2012-01-23T10:41:00.000Z	oops	darkcrimson	are you sure? You think it has anything to do with KDE or Gnome Integration packages?
2012-01-23T10:42:00.000Z	darkcrimson	oops	Well, that's the thing. The time of the event being random, followed by the problem occuring after a reinstall...I'm left to think corrupt files. However, that is possible.
2012-01-23T10:44:00.000Z	darkcrimson	oops	You would think if it were integration packages, the problem would be more widespread. I can't find a single incident elsewhere.
2012-01-23T10:44:00.000Z	darkcrimson	oops	Let us know how it worked.
