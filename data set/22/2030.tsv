2010-06-13T18:45:00.000Z	thune3	amy_	there are some firefox extentions "youtube to mp3" and "youtube mp3" that use online servers to convert youtube videos to mp3. There are ways to do it on ubuntu, but not as easy.
2010-06-13T18:46:00.000Z	amy_	thune3	well is it possible to tell  me the procedure?
2010-06-13T18:48:00.000Z	thune3	amy_	procedure for ff extensions?
2010-06-13T18:48:00.000Z	amy_	thune3	I'm not too sure how to do it?
2010-06-13T18:51:00.000Z	thune3	amy_	firefox -> tools -> add-ons  select get add-ons and search "mp3" in search box. select add-on and click "add to firefox"
2010-06-13T18:52:00.000Z	amy_	thune3	I have done what you just said
2010-06-13T18:53:00.000Z	thune3	amy_	which one
2010-06-13T18:53:00.000Z	amy_	thune3	youtube to mp3
2010-06-13T18:54:00.000Z	thune3	amy_	when you go to youtube, there are a couple options right below the video
2010-06-13T18:54:00.000Z	amy_	thune3	ok
2010-06-13T18:55:00.000Z	amy_	thune3	which option should I choose?
2010-06-13T18:55:00.000Z	thune3	amy_	try both, i don't know what the quality difference is. i'd start with high
