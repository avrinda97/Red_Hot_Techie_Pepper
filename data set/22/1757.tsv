2010-01-17T23:51:00.000Z	__raven		can UNISON synchronize in near REALTIME?
2010-01-17T23:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	__raven	it'll go as fast as the link between will transfer te data
2010-01-17T23:54:00.000Z	__raven	ActionParsnip__	i need to have the home folder on two pcs synchronized always - in at least every minute - but i have to start it by hand every time and then it checkes everything over an hour - 60 gb - what can i do?
2010-01-17T23:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	__raven	cron the job to run every minute
2010-01-17T23:56:00.000Z	__raven	ActionParsnip__	but the process lasts for more than one minute - then i'll have thousands of processes or it'll never be successful
2010-01-17T23:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	__raven	then you will need to time to see how often you can run it
2010-01-18T00:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	__raven	you'll have to experiment with some dummy data to then transfer to the prime time
2010-01-17T23:59:00.000Z	__raven	ActionParsnip__	is not possible to start it as background process so that it makes a protocol instead of check every file every time?
2010-01-17T23:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	__raven	cron will run as a service and the copying with run as a service too
2010-01-18T00:00:00.000Z	__raven	ActionParsnip__	yes but this will not change the process (checking-protocol) but only the automatism
2010-01-18T00:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	__raven	true, if you use rsync it will only transmit the changes which will be quicker
2010-01-18T00:02:00.000Z	__raven	ActionParsnip__	right but rsync only updates into one direction - i have a special problem it seems....?
2010-01-18T00:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	__raven	sounds like it, ive not done bi-directional
2010-01-18T00:04:00.000Z	__raven	ActionParsnip__	could you imagine any solution with this: http://fileschanged.sourceforge.net/ ?
2010-01-18T00:06:00.000Z	__raven	ActionParsnip__	difficult because i have not much time to test it in every detail
2010-01-18T00:06:00.000Z	__raven	ActionParsnip__	what do you think about this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=655969
2010-01-18T00:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	__raven	looks neat, you'd have to test
2010-01-18T00:07:00.000Z	__raven	ActionParsnip__	ok i'll try - tnx
2010-01-18T00:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	__raven	if you backup the intended data you can go to town on the real data to test actual performance, you can restore whenever you need
2010-01-18T00:08:00.000Z	__raven	ActionParsnip__	yes i'll have to take some time ;)
2010-01-18T01:25:00.000Z	__raven	ActionParsnip__	it's me again - it seems that unison does not delete deleted files on the other pc - what could be the problem/setting?
2010-01-18T01:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	__raven	not something ive ever used duder, might be a setting in the app though
