2010-12-26T17:56:00.000Z	guampa		i've managed to break the ethernet network in the same *weird* way in two ubuntu installs, and can't seem to find out what it is: dhcp works, udp hence too, icmp works, BUT i can't establish tcp connections! it seems the card doesn't send anything...uber puzzled. please help!
2010-12-26T17:56:00.000Z	CyL	guampa	can you surf the web?
2010-12-26T17:57:00.000Z	guampa	CyL	nope, not anything involving tcp
2010-12-26T17:58:00.000Z	CyL	guampa	can you have a dump of one of your trials?
2010-12-26T18:01:00.000Z	guampa	CyL	sure, what would you like to see?
2010-12-26T18:01:00.000Z	CyL	guampa	just a sec
2010-12-26T18:04:00.000Z	CyL	guampa	try issuing a "sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -s0 -w test.pcap tcp port 80" and try to make a test connection to www.google.com
2010-12-26T18:05:00.000Z	guampa	CyL	right on
2010-12-26T18:05:00.000Z	CyL	guampa	paste the results on a pastebin so that I can see whats going on
2010-12-26T18:06:00.000Z	CyL	guampa	you van read that file with "sudo tcpdump -r test.pcap"

2010-12-26T18:10:00.000Z	guampa	CyL	only can try connections to the router (192.168.1.1), as internet isn't reachable over ethernet here (i have only 3G here)
2010-12-26T18:11:00.000Z	CyL	guampa	most probably your router at 192.168.1.1 is blocking the connections
2010-12-26T18:12:00.000Z	guampa	CyL	i can connect to the router when in other OS or even with a liveCD
2010-12-26T18:13:00.000Z	CyL	guampa	what makes you believe this is not related to a hardware problem
2010-12-26T18:14:00.000Z	guampa	CyL	the fact that i've been able to use the nic under a liveCD / other OS
2010-12-26T18:15:00.000Z	CyL	guampa	is it possible that there have been a driver update in the OS?
2010-12-26T18:17:00.000Z	guampa	CyL	perhaps, what puzzles me is that the same problem arised on my laptop before (months ago). I was on a different network then, and could only do dhcp and icmp. Thought then it was a damaged nic, but after seeing the same here and knowing it's specific to this installation i'm puzzled
2010-12-26T18:17:00.000Z	CyL	guampa	sorry, me too..
2010-12-26T18:18:00.000Z	CyL	guampa	I'm also puzzled
2010-12-26T18:18:00.000Z	guampa	CyL	thanks much anyway for helping fellow
2010-12-26T18:18:00.000Z	CyL	guampa	you're welcome
