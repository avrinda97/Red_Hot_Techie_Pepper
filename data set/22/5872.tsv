2011-10-21T16:15:00.000Z	Andy80		anyone is experiencing problems with Dropbox and Oneiric Nautilus integration? I cannot see the dropbox icon anymore... there is not the "Dropbox" contextual menu on each file ecc...
2011-10-21T16:16:00.000Z	popey	Andy80	working fine here
2011-10-21T16:18:00.000Z	Andy80	popey	maybe I should re-install it?
2011-10-21T16:30:00.000Z	Andy80	popey	ok, a simple reinstall was enough #DropBox :)
2012-01-26T12:52:00.000Z	popey	Andy80	blame the switch
2012-01-26T12:53:00.000Z	Andy80	popey	I know.... but it must work. It works if you FIRST boot the PC normally, then you connect the switch, so I'd like to force the resolution to 1680x1050 since I know that works even with the switch connected
2012-01-26T12:54:00.000Z	popey	Andy80	probably easiest to craft an xorg.conf which specifies the necessary modelines and resolutions
2012-01-26T12:54:00.000Z	Andy80	popey	exactly..... but before messing the xorg.conf I'd like to test the settings with xrandr :P
2012-01-26T12:55:00.000Z	popey	Andy80	you can add modes to xrandr manually
2012-01-26T12:55:00.000Z	popey	Andy80	xorg --help
2012-01-26T12:55:00.000Z	popey	Andy80	xrandr --help
2012-01-26T12:56:00.000Z	Andy80	popey	I was giving a look to this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia but it only says: xrandr --addmode S-video ... not a good example :P
2012-01-26T12:56:00.000Z	popey	Andy80	you need newmode first
2012-01-26T12:57:00.000Z	popey	Andy80	http://paste.ubuntu.com/817373/ <- like that
2012-01-26T12:57:00.000Z	Andy80	popey	let me try that example... it should work
2012-01-26T12:57:00.000Z	popey	Andy80	i used gtf to get the modeline
2012-01-26T12:58:00.000Z	Andy80	popey	no, it doesn't.... xrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default
2012-01-26T12:59:00.000Z	Andy80	popey	I tried the commands you copy-pasted on paste.ubuntu....
2012-01-26T12:59:00.000Z	popey	Andy80	that was just an example
2012-01-26T13:01:00.000Z	Andy80	popey	you're right, but I don't know all values.... for example: xrandr --newmode "1280x720_60.00"  74.48  1280 1336 1472 1664  720 721 724 746  -HSync +Vsync - what is that 74.48?
2012-01-26T13:05:00.000Z	popey	Andy80	as I said... use gtf to generate the modeline
2012-01-26T13:07:00.000Z	Andy80	popey	bobo37773 both the videomode generated by cvt or gft fail.
