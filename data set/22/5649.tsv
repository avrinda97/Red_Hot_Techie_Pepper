2007-05-13T14:15:00.000Z	Caramba_		Does anybody here subscribe to podcasts?
2007-05-13T14:16:00.000Z	bbrazil	Caramba_	try asking your actual question
2007-05-13T14:16:00.000Z	Caramba_	bbrazil	Sure thing! Any particular software you'd recommend to subscribe to podcasts with Ubuntu *in console mode*?
2007-05-13T14:17:00.000Z	bbrazil	Caramba_	don't ask me, I don't use the things :) text-only could be fun
2007-05-13T14:18:00.000Z	Caramba_	bbrazil	Aye, my multimedia server runs in console mode, but i'd love to be able to subscribe to podcasts with it as well
2007-05-13T14:19:00.000Z	bbrazil	Caramba_	ah, a headless server (no keyboard/mouse)? You can still run X apps off it if you have a Ubuntu desktop somewhere
2007-05-13T14:20:00.000Z	Caramba_	bbrazil	Yeah, i know, and it would kinda solve my problem. But what I'd really like to do is to simple have it download my fav podcasts on a regular basis, and then I play them through the web interface
2007-05-13T14:21:00.000Z	bbrazil	Caramba_	I'm sure plenty of people have done that before. Have you tried searching on google? 'media center podcast' would probably do it
2007-05-13T14:22:00.000Z	Caramba_	bbrazil	My web browser is hot on google while i'm chatting here :) But console mode stuff *is* hard to find when you're talking multimedia - your average user wants a GUI
2007-05-13T14:23:00.000Z	bbrazil	Caramba_	there's bound to be web interface stuff too
2007-05-13T14:23:00.000Z	Caramba_	bbrazil	true, i'm using jinzora with mpd - a nice combo for playing music. but it's podcast handling is very buggy :(
2007-05-13T14:24:00.000Z	Caramba_	bbrazil	but it's probably not the only one, i just have to find a good solution. which is why i'm here ;)
2007-05-13T14:24:00.000Z	bbrazil	Caramba_	you might have better luck posting on the forums
2007-05-13T14:25:00.000Z	Caramba_	bbrazil	True - but i'm an impatient soul, and usually come here first. The company is nice, as well!
2007-05-13T14:25:00.000Z	bbrazil	Caramba_	this place is crazy though, I don't think you're going to find an answer anytime soon
2007-05-13T14:27:00.000Z	Caramba_	bbrazil	the discussion is somewhat unfocused, yeah, but the people are helpful and i have gotten help with quite tough questions here! none of the snobbery i find, say, in debian channels
2007-05-13T14:28:00.000Z	bbrazil	Caramba_	actually, have you tried asking the mythbox people?
2007-05-13T14:44:00.000Z	Caramba_	bbrazil	Check this out if your interested: http://linc.homeunix.org:8080/scripts/bashpodder/ Serious goofling led me there :)
2007-05-13T14:45:00.000Z	bbrazil	Caramba_	looks like my kind of program
2007-05-13T14:45:00.000Z	Caramba_	bbrazil	I like it already, and I haven't even installed it ;)
2007-05-13T14:48:00.000Z	Caramba_	bbrazil	A happy user, running bashpodder on Ubuntu (or whataver with cron) http://robbiethegeek.blogspot.com/
2007-05-13T15:12:00.000Z	Caramba_	bbrazil	bashpodder works like a charm. Just what I was looking for!
