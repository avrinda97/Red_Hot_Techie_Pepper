2011-05-01T02:01:00.000Z	notlistening		can anyone else get negative to work in 11.04 for me
2011-05-01T02:01:00.000Z	notlistening		if you turn if onto all windows do new windows inherit negativity?
2011-05-01T02:02:00.000Z	ohsix	notlistening	theres no distinction for new windows, it's done as they're all rendered
2011-05-01T02:02:00.000Z	ohsix	notlistening	so if you do per window it's just that window, or the entire desktop it's the whole thing
2011-05-01T02:03:00.000Z	notlistening	ohsix	well thats what i mean
2011-05-01T02:03:00.000Z	notlistening	ohsix	open a new app :P
2011-05-01T02:03:00.000Z	ohsix	notlistening	if it's to the desktop it still applies to the new window, but let me try here to confirm
2011-05-01T02:04:00.000Z	ohsix	notlistening	wow! that's a bug haha
2011-05-01T02:04:00.000Z	ohsix	notlistening	please report it so i can mark it as affecting me as well, i use it often
2011-05-01T02:04:00.000Z	notlistening	ohsix	I have a long list of them :)
2011-05-01T02:04:00.000Z	notlistening	ohsix	I will post the report soon
2011-05-01T02:05:00.000Z	ohsix	notlistening	post a bug instead, on launchpad.net
2011-05-01T02:05:00.000Z	ohsix	notlistening	that's a functionality change from .8 that i'm pretty sure wasn't intended
2011-05-01T02:15:00.000Z	ohsix	notlistening	thanks
2011-05-01T02:16:00.000Z	notlistening	ohsix	do you ever use the enhanced zoom feature?
2011-05-01T02:17:00.000Z	ohsix	notlistening	i did yea, but i haven't been able to use it satisfactorily with compiz .9, very very very awful slow
2011-05-01T02:18:00.000Z	notlistening	ohsix	well unity doesn't play nicely with it now :(, can't access the menu when zooming
2011-05-01T02:19:00.000Z	ohsix	notlistening	ah i didn't try it with unity
2011-05-01T02:20:00.000Z	notlistening	ohsix	I would like to adopt unity but it is giving more heaches that its worth with the features of compiz i use regularly
2011-05-01T02:28:00.000Z	notlistening	ohsix	It was not so much a poll, as i was not counting
2011-05-01T02:47:00.000Z	notlistening	ohsix	if you get a chance to look at the evolution bug i would appreciate it
2011-05-01T03:28:00.000Z	ohsix	notlistening	it has a "Recommends" in ubuntu-desktop, that's all it amounts to ;]
