2007-02-01T17:03:00.000Z	roho		how do you do file associations in nautilus?
2007-02-01T17:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	try right click, properties, open with and change the association there
2007-02-01T17:03:00.000Z	roho	thoreauputic	i don't think you can change the association there
2007-02-01T17:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	yes you can
2007-02-01T17:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	I do it all the time :)
2007-02-01T17:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	just right click the file and try it
2007-02-01T17:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	*sigh* just try what I said
2007-02-01T17:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	no you didn't
2007-02-01T17:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	properties, open with, add
2007-02-01T17:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	no worries :)
2007-02-01T17:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	probably hardware specific
2007-02-01T17:08:00.000Z	roho	thoreauputic	so it has nothing to do with the screensaver?
2007-02-01T17:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	some laptops work better than others with sleep
2007-02-01T17:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	try turning the screensver off to see
2007-02-01T17:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	if you are just locking and not sleeping, it probably is the screensver
2007-02-01T17:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	are you using gnome-screensaver? You can try xscreensaver instead
2007-02-01T17:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	I think there's also an "xlock" program - from memory
2007-02-01T17:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	xscreensaver may be "old school", but it works a lot better than gnome-screensaver :)
2007-02-01T17:12:00.000Z	roho	thoreauputic	i'm not knocking it!
2007-02-01T17:17:00.000Z	roho	thoreauputic	xlockmore
2007-02-01T17:17:00.000Z	roho	thoreauputic	that's the one, right?
2007-02-01T17:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	roho	not sure to be honest
