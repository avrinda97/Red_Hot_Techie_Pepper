2011-04-28T10:55:00.000Z	aroman		hey, how can I make all of my function keys perform their action without needing to have fn pressed? (i.e invert the fn button). thanks!
2011-04-28T10:57:00.000Z	aroman		i need two hands to do something i should be able to do effortlessly
2011-04-28T10:57:00.000Z	aroman		>:
2011-04-28T10:58:00.000Z	aroman		and un-press when I actually press it
2011-04-28T10:58:00.000Z	aroman		e.g,
2011-04-28T10:58:00.000Z	aroman		if I hit f1 which both maximizes and toggles volume mute, I want mute to be _default_
2011-04-28T11:00:00.000Z	aroman		this is a very simple task
2011-04-28T11:00:00.000Z	aroman		I want to invert the fn key's function
2011-04-28T11:01:00.000Z	aroman		i could knock that out in a few hours this weekend.
2011-04-28T11:01:00.000Z	aroman		i'll do just that :)
2011-04-28T11:02:00.000Z	maco	aroman	is this a mac? there's a tool somewhere for reversing their use
2011-04-28T11:02:00.000Z	aroman	maco	no, but regardless, that's a software setting in OS X
2011-04-28T11:02:00.000Z	maco	aroman	and in ubuntu...
2011-04-28T11:02:00.000Z	aroman	maco	oh it is?
2011-04-28T11:02:00.000Z	maco	aroman	yeah, we have a way to handle mac keyboards. lemme look it up again
2011-04-28T11:03:00.000Z	aroman	maco	oh right, that actually makes some sense
2011-04-28T11:04:00.000Z	maco	aroman	echo 0 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode
2011-04-28T11:05:00.000Z	maco	aroman	oh actually 1, not 0
2011-04-28T11:05:00.000Z	aroman	maco	whoa, trying that now, thanks a ton

2011-04-28T11:05:00.000Z	maco	aroman	dunno if thatll work on a non-apple keyboard though. experiment time i guess
2011-04-28T11:06:00.000Z	aroman	maco	it won't, the module isn't loaded. but I guess I could digaround and see if I could modprobe it somehow
