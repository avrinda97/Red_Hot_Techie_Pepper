2006-11-06T12:29:00.000Z	Juan___	coNP	do you know if you need to do something else than a sudo mount -o -P 192.168.1.3:/media/sda1 /Users/juanmedinpineiro/sda1/ in the client ?
2006-11-06T12:29:00.000Z	coNP	Juan___	maybe give the type "-t nfs", but not sure; does it not work the way you try it?
2006-11-06T12:30:00.000Z	Juan___	coNP	No. It says 'Permission denied' when I try to cd to it.
2006-11-06T12:30:00.000Z	coNP	Juan___	what does "ls -l" say about this directory?
2006-11-06T12:31:00.000Z	Juan___	coNP	drwxrwx---   16 root      46      4096 Jan  1  1970 sda1
2006-11-06T12:31:00.000Z	Juan___	coNP	I can't cd even as root
2006-11-06T12:32:00.000Z	coNP	Juan___	how did you setup the other machine?
2006-11-06T12:34:00.000Z	Juan___	coNP	Just added a NFS share using the system settings share. NFS options:: public
2006-11-06T12:34:00.000Z	Juan___	coNP	Allowed hosts: * asynch, squash
2006-11-06T12:35:00.000Z	coNP	Juan___	I see, it should work
2006-11-06T12:35:00.000Z	coNP	Juan___	what does it write, when you try to cd in it?
2006-11-06T12:36:00.000Z	Juan___	coNP	bash: cd: sda1: Permission denied
2006-11-06T12:37:00.000Z	coNP	Juan___	what are the permissions on the directory (on the server machine?)
2006-11-06T12:38:00.000Z	Juan___	coNP	drwxrwx---
2006-11-06T12:39:00.000Z	coNP	Juan___	I see, now I have no idea
2006-11-06T12:39:00.000Z	Juan___	coNP	Well, I'll try Samba then. Thank you anyway.
2006-11-06T12:40:00.000Z	coNP	Juan___	altough this makes me unhappy, I hate unsolved problems
2006-11-06T12:41:00.000Z	Juan___	coNP	Don't worry It must be something that I'm missing here
