2011-06-29T12:09:00.000Z	hdon		hi guys :) i cannot switch users from xscreensaver. choosing "switch user" button returns me to screensaver. WTF. this is an intermittent problem i first noticed about a week ago. fuck-up in xscreensaver or gdm?
2011-06-29T12:10:00.000Z	bronaugh	hdon	any idea how that actually works? ie, does it start up gdm on vt8 or what?
2011-06-29T12:10:00.000Z	bronaugh	hdon	how does the signalling work? dbus?
2011-06-29T12:11:00.000Z	hdon	bronaugh	good question
2011-06-29T12:13:00.000Z	bronaugh	hdon	you used a dirty wordy.
2011-06-29T12:13:00.000Z	hdon	bronaugh	that's ok, i was being friendly, and i'm 12
2011-06-29T12:14:00.000Z	hdon	bronaugh	he's using gparted. he has some sort of gui problem. a "lock" icon he said.
2011-06-29T12:15:00.000Z	bronaugh	hdon	oh; ok.
2011-06-29T12:21:00.000Z	bronaugh	hdon	there's a simpler way to test that. telnet 192.168.0.110 3389
2011-06-29T12:21:00.000Z	bronaugh	hdon	nmap is, unsurprisingly, not always installed on people's machines :P
2011-06-29T12:23:00.000Z	hdon	bronaugh	you have no idea how angry it makes me that a basic version of nmap isn't installed by default. for that matter, the host(1) command isn't either
2011-06-29T12:24:00.000Z	bronaugh	hdon	host, yeah, that'd bug me. good reasons not to have nmap ;)
2011-06-29T12:24:00.000Z	hdon	bronaugh	why good reasons not to have nmap? i would accept not dragging in lua etc.
2011-06-29T12:25:00.000Z	bronaugh	hdon	well; if it's there, naughty people will use it. :)
2011-06-29T12:25:00.000Z	bronaugh	hdon	I agree in principle; most of hmy machines have nmap installed because it's really useful. but yeah. not the best thing to put in a default install.
2011-06-29T12:26:00.000Z	hdon	bronaugh	i don't understand what can go wrong using nmap... what ports are open to me is like index.html
2011-06-29T12:28:00.000Z	hdon	bronaugh	she just wants to rdp but it's not open to other LAN computers
2011-06-29T12:29:00.000Z	bronaugh	hdon	or she's trying to use the wrong tool for the job.
2011-06-29T12:29:00.000Z	hdon	bronaugh	ah, good question. i just assume if someone wants rdp, that's what they want.
2011-06-29T12:35:00.000Z	hdon	bronaugh	good eye.. i would have never thought it wasn't ubuntu for some reason...
2011-06-29T12:37:00.000Z	bronaugh	hdon	ok, so is there any rdesktop -server- for ubuntu or a reason to use one on ubuntu?
2011-06-29T12:38:00.000Z	hdon	bronaugh	dunno, scarcely ever used rdp
