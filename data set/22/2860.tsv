2009-05-09T08:41:00.000Z	noob		hi all... i'v installed ubuntu on a netbook, but the display is detected as 800x600 and uses only the centre of the screen but the resolution of this netbook is 1024x768, how do i change it?
2009-05-09T08:41:00.000Z	mzz	noob	pastebin /var/log/Xorg.0.log please
2009-05-09T08:41:00.000Z	mzz	noob	what xangua said will work if you're using the right drivers and they're working correctly.
2009-05-09T08:42:00.000Z	noob	mzz	te log or the conf?
2009-05-09T08:42:00.000Z	mzz	noob	log please

2009-05-09T08:47:00.000Z	mzz	noob	ddc is failing for some unknown reason, drat
2009-05-09T08:48:00.000Z	mzz	noob	you may have better luck googling for others with the same kind of netbook and the same problem
2009-05-09T08:49:00.000Z	noob	mzz	 this is a crappy old sony vaio notebook, nobody in the world i think is still using it! just thought of reviving it in xubuntu. so is there anyway to set the display in the xorg.conf?
2009-05-09T08:51:00.000Z	mzz	noob	will the gui let you switch to the right res?
2009-05-09T08:53:00.000Z	noob	mzz	 no , gui offers 640x480 as the other choice!
2009-05-09T08:53:00.000Z	mzz	noob	then you may have to put some explicit VertRefresh/HorizSync rules in xorg.conf to work around the problem
2009-05-09T08:54:00.000Z	noob	mzz	anything , could u give me an idea of how to set it...?
2009-05-09T08:54:00.000Z	mzz	noob	sorry, not sure what sane values would be off the top of my head
2009-05-09T08:56:00.000Z	noob	mzz	robin0800 is googling the better way.. to have an idea of how to set things right? if so what do search for to find the right solution?
2009-05-09T08:56:00.000Z	mzz	noob	although actually, since this is not a crt screen, pinning VertRefresh at 60, using some huge range for HorizSync, and making sure you have no higher res than 1024x768 listed in your Display SubSection could work
2009-05-09T08:56:00.000Z	mzz	noob	I'm not sure if ddc is supposed to work on your hardware, but unless it's really weird hardware it normally should
2009-05-09T09:01:00.000Z	mzz	noob	no need to reboot, just restart the server (or gdm)
2009-05-09T09:02:00.000Z	noob	mzz	 oh... x restart is enough.. ok.. that is easier to play around with :)
2009-05-09T09:02:00.000Z	mzz	noob	if all you're editing is xorg.conf just restarting the server suffices
2009-05-09T09:03:00.000Z	noob	mzz	thanx man...
