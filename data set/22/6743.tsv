2006-08-16T05:51:00.000Z	chris449		hmm, anyone that remembers my problem from above, i chose to boot straight from the primary partition, and all it says is GRUB
2006-08-16T05:51:00.000Z	chris449		not even loading stage something, it just says GRUB
2006-08-16T05:52:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chris449	does it say GRUB or GRUB>
2006-08-16T05:53:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chris449	Well then stage1 isn't properly installed. Did you use the livecd or the alternate install cd
2006-08-16T05:55:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chris449	Ahh, so you're using bootmagic to multiboot?
2006-08-16T05:55:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chris449	if so then you need to put stage1 on hdd as well.
2006-08-16T05:56:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chris449	Are you using the livecd?
2006-08-16T05:56:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chris449	Do you know if your network was properly detected when you booted from the live cd? (ie. did you try to browse the web from it?)
2006-08-16T05:57:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chris449	I see. Well I will need you to boot from the live cd and then start an IRC client from it. Then I'll walk you trough fixing your GRUB from there.
2006-08-16T06:12:00.000Z	chris449	BlueEagle	remember me? is it possible to do it without being on irc off the live cd?
2006-08-16T06:13:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chris449	Well I am helping forngren with the exact same problem now.
2006-08-16T06:13:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chris449	but being on IRC would definetly help.
2006-08-16T06:21:00.000Z	chris449	BlueEagle	i have my linux partition mounted and proc and dev bound to it, what now?
2006-08-16T06:37:00.000Z	chris449	BlueEagle	something very odd happened
2006-08-16T06:38:00.000Z	chris449	BlueEagle	i selected the linux option in bootmagic, and then it literally ran grub
2006-08-16T06:38:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chris449	it will.
2006-08-16T06:38:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chris449	now if you don't wan the bootmenu (which you do) you can set the timeout to 0 in /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-08-16T06:39:00.000Z	chris449	BlueEagle	ah, and it will only run ubuntu then? and i use bootmagic to run the rest?
2006-08-16T06:39:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chris449	that is correct. You can also remove the windowsXP option from menu.lst
2006-08-16T06:40:00.000Z	BlueEagle	chris449	I do recomend having the boot menu so you can run different kernels and safemode if you once get a kernel that doesn't work properly.
2006-08-16T06:40:00.000Z	chris449	BlueEagle	yeh i might just leave it as is, i can't fit anything else on this harddrive anyway
2006-08-16T06:41:00.000Z	chris449	BlueEagle	thanks for ur help i'm off to bed
