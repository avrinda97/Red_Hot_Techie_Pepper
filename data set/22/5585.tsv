2007-06-05T10:54:00.000Z	clutchmm		I just got a new 250gig external usb hdd, do I need to format it, or can I just use it like a flash drive?
2007-06-05T10:54:00.000Z	n2diy_	clutchmm	 plug it in, what happens?
2007-06-05T10:55:00.000Z	clutchmm	n2diy_	my system opens a file browser to it, that's why I was asking
2007-06-05T10:56:00.000Z	n2diy_	clutchmm	that it is good, the file system has been found.
2007-06-05T10:57:00.000Z	n2diy_	clutchmm	the system sees it as another drive.
2007-06-05T10:57:00.000Z	clutchmm	n2diy_	yes, it opens as a blank drive that I have to unmount to unplug
2007-06-05T10:58:00.000Z	n2diy_	clutchmm	ok, so you can play with it like any other storage device.
2007-06-05T12:18:00.000Z	clutchmm	n2diy_	any ideas as to why gparted won't give me the option to resize the FAT32 partition of my external drive?
2007-06-05T12:19:00.000Z	n2diy_	clutchmm	is it a Dell machine?
2007-06-05T12:19:00.000Z	clutchmm	n2diy_	nope, it's an MSI laptop
2007-06-05T12:26:00.000Z	clutchmm	n2diy_	do I need to unmount the drive do partition it?
2007-06-05T12:28:00.000Z	n2diy_	clutchmm	yes.
2007-06-05T12:53:00.000Z	clutchmm	n2diy_	my external drive now has a 118gig ext3 partition that my file browser labeled "disk" to copy a folder to it in the terminal I use "sudo cp -r path/to/folder /disk/folder" right? or is there a different path to the disk?
2007-06-05T12:54:00.000Z	n2diy_	clutchmm	drag and drop?
2007-06-05T12:55:00.000Z	clutchmm	n2diy_	I was going to try that but I didn't know if one "sudo nautilus" window and one "Places > disk" window would let me do that
2007-06-05T12:55:00.000Z	n2diy_	clutchmm	go for it!
2007-06-05T12:58:00.000Z	clutchmm	n2diy_	yeah, drag and drop gave me an error that moving to /media/disk didn't have the proper permissions
2007-06-05T13:00:00.000Z	n2diy_	clutchmm	roger, kill nautilus, and in a terminal start it as gksudo nautilis.
2007-06-05T13:06:00.000Z	n2diy_	clutchmm	??
2007-06-05T13:17:00.000Z	clutchmm	n2diy_	crap the folder I want to move was created by vmware server and has a space in it, how do I get around spaces in file names in the terminal?
2007-06-05T13:18:00.000Z	n2diy_	clutchmm	I don't know.
2007-06-05T14:19:00.000Z	clutchmm	n2diy_	are you still on?
