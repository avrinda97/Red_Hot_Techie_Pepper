2010-11-13T00:07:00.000Z	Kingsy		***hey ppl, I have just decided that I am going to try and setup a print server / webserver / mailserver in my back room .. is anyone available to talk about this with me for a few mins?
2010-11-13T00:08:00.000Z	Kingsy		like for example, the computer I have in mind for the server is very slow (it previously had windows XP installed on it) would ubuntu even run on it?
2010-11-13T00:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kingsy	If it ran XP it certainly has enough resources to run Ubuntu server.
2010-11-13T00:12:00.000Z	Kingsy	Jordan_U	- yea but I am not the only person going to be accessing it, so it needs to have a GUI interface
2010-11-13T00:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kingsy	Do you plan to use the GUI for managing the server functionality or as a desktop?
2010-11-13T00:20:00.000Z	Kingsy	Jordan_U	- well the real purpose of the server is as a print server, so I was gonna ask how ubuntu was with printers? it needs to be able to print documents from windows pcs and linux, and it also needs to be able to run any printer I stick on it..    the GUI as such would just be to change the printer setups and things
2010-11-13T00:21:00.000Z	Kingsy	Jordan_U	- any thoughts?
2010-11-13T00:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kingsy	The "any printer" portion will be a problem, more so if you use standard windows printer sharing.
2010-11-13T00:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kingsy	With Ubuntu most printers are supported, and with supported printers you need no configuration other than plugging it in.
2010-11-13T00:33:00.000Z	Kingsy	Jordan_U	- well, I would have the printer installed and setup on ubuntu server, then surely cant you just find that printer on the windows machine as a network printer and print to it?
2010-11-13T00:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kingsy	I haven't done much work with windows printer sharing but as I understand it, both the client and the server machines need drivers for the printer being used.
2010-11-13T00:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kingsy	So you would be limited to printers that are supported by Ubuntu, and would need to instal drivers as needed on the clients.
2010-11-13T00:36:00.000Z	Kingsy	Jordan_U	- right ok.. well I am guessing ubuntu supports brands rather than specifc printers right?
2010-11-13T00:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kingsy	While there are families of related models drivers are fairly specific to a given model.
2010-11-13T00:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kingsy	As planttt has corrected me, you can use any printer supported by the client even if it's not supported by the server directly.
2010-11-13T00:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kingsy	What is the exact situation you're using this for?
2010-11-13T00:39:00.000Z	Kingsy	Jordan_U	- its gonna be a print server in my house, but I have 5 ppl living here and quite a few terminals windows and linux, and I don't know which printers I might be plugging into it in the future
2010-11-13T00:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kingsy	Would the printers ever be purchased by anyone but you?
2011-08-16T23:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kingsy	Just use "sudo some_command" to run some_command as root.
2012-09-23T22:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kingsy	"formatted" how?
2012-09-23T22:06:00.000Z	Kingsy	Jordan_U	not sure at this point, it was done a MAC.. just seeing if I can recover any files for a friend
