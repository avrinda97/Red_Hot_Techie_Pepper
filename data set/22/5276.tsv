2009-11-08T05:37:00.000Z	Rods_Tiger		I can't ssh into my ubuntu machine
2009-11-08T05:38:00.000Z	Rods_Tiger		I've got it - it used to work
2009-11-08T05:38:00.000Z	Rods_Tiger		has anything changed with karmic's release - the ssh used to work prior to the release
2009-11-08T05:39:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	what happens when you try to connect?
2009-11-08T05:40:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	you have sshd running on the seriver?
2009-11-08T05:40:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	do you have any other way to connect
2009-11-08T05:40:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	or other way to access the server
2009-11-08T05:41:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	it has a screen too?
2009-11-08T05:41:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	can you ssh to the server from the server
2009-11-08T05:43:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	you are on the same network?
2009-11-08T05:43:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	can you ping the server?
2009-11-08T05:43:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	try that
2009-11-08T05:44:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	can the server ping your client?
2009-11-08T05:46:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	ok, you are sure they are in the same subnet?
2009-11-08T05:47:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	they get ips from dhcp?
2009-11-08T05:47:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	do they both have internet access
2009-11-08T05:50:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	are there other devices on the network?
2009-11-08T05:51:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	can any device ping any other device?
2009-11-08T05:52:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	maybe you have a router blocking access to other clients or something
2009-11-08T05:52:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	well if nothing can ping anything else, idk how you are going to ssh
2009-11-10T16:42:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	nothing to do with your internal ip
2009-11-15T04:13:00.000Z	Billiard	Rods_Tiger	fyi, not a solution, but you can probably hold the power button in to shut the computer off rather than removing the battery
