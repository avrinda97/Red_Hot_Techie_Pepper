2005-10-19T05:11:00.000Z	robotgeek	sorush20	i think that usually means that the floppy's first sector is corrupted
2005-10-19T05:12:00.000Z	sorush20	robotgeek	is there a way to fix this issure.?
2005-10-19T05:12:00.000Z	robotgeek	sorush20	it's useless if you want to use it for booting
2005-10-19T05:14:00.000Z	sorush20	robotgeek	well I can't even mount it to read it in konqueror
2005-10-19T05:15:00.000Z	robotgeek	sorush20	nope, floppy is pretty much useless :(
