2011-03-03T04:14:00.000Z	raido	crimsonmane	how about pulling it out and re inserting it, also, since its a USB device, it may be a power setting that you can tweak in your bios.
2011-03-03T04:14:00.000Z	crimsonmane	raido	i did remove and insert the WUSB and the power light won't come on or device not even get detected.
2011-03-03T04:15:00.000Z	raido	crimsonmane	check bios settings
2011-03-03T04:16:00.000Z	crimsonmane	raido	 what should i be looking for?
2011-03-03T04:16:00.000Z	raido	crimsonmane	anything USB bus and or power related
2011-03-03T04:17:00.000Z	crimsonmane	raido	my keyboard and mouse are USB. the WirelessUSB card is the only one with issues. do you still feel i should check bios?
2011-03-03T04:18:00.000Z	raido	crimsonmane	are you on a laptop?
2011-03-03T04:19:00.000Z	crimsonmane	raido	desktop
2011-03-03T04:19:00.000Z	crimsonmane	raido	i'm fairly certain also that i have nothing in bios set to power down for idleness. i like pyaing extra for my juice... jk. but still... "fairly" certain...
2011-03-03T04:19:00.000Z	raido	crimsonmane	oh, well thats not as likely a bios setting but at least you can rule it out by checking
2011-03-03T04:22:00.000Z	raido	crimsonmane	if it sleeps from inactivity, then you could  write a simpke script to ping an address somewhere every few minutes
2011-03-03T04:22:00.000Z	crimsonmane	raido	the way i discovered this problem was downloading large files (WoW, torrents, Pandora)
2011-03-03T04:22:00.000Z	raido	crimsonmane	it craps out on large xfers???
2011-03-03T04:23:00.000Z	crimsonmane	raido	it doesn't crap out, it just quits doing its job. if i stay at the computer doing other things the net stays solid
2011-03-03T04:23:00.000Z	crimsonmane	raido	size doesnt matter either (insert laughter here)
2011-03-03T04:23:00.000Z	raido	crimsonmane	lol
2011-03-03T04:24:00.000Z	raido	crimsonmane	you got me. If possible, Id try a different piece of hardware.
2011-03-03T04:25:00.000Z	crimsonmane	raido	you are correct sir (ma'am?) WUSB devices have a history of fail with linux. but i had it long before i had linux. AND to top that off, i have a micro board and my sound card occupies the one PCI slot :) man i sure know how to pick my hardware!
2011-03-03T04:26:00.000Z	raido	crimsonmane	even another USB dongle may be worth a try
2011-03-03T04:26:00.000Z	crimsonmane	raido	forgive my ignorance. what is a dongle?
2011-03-03T04:27:00.000Z	raido	crimsonmane	loosly termed for anything that sticks out from a USB port.
2011-03-03T04:27:00.000Z	crimsonmane	raido	thank you :)
