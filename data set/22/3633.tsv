2009-06-10T12:03:00.000Z	WIGGMPk		Can anyone take a look at this http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d5593ea32 I am trying to get a custom kernel installed and it fails when I am trying to install the debian package..
2009-06-10T12:04:00.000Z	simplexio	WIGGMPk	i have same problem, and i use --force-all option on dpkg -i
2009-06-10T12:04:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	simplexio	are you installing the 2.6.29-4 kernel?
2009-06-10T12:04:00.000Z	simplexio	WIGGMPk	that debian systems probasbly needs something more, like nvidia driver or something
2009-06-10T12:05:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	simplexio	it cant be that simple lol
2009-06-10T12:05:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	simplexio	are you using kernelcheck to compile yours?
2009-06-10T12:05:00.000Z	simplexio	WIGGMPk	i tried 2.6.29, for somereason it didnt work so i still run 2.6.28.? something
2009-06-10T12:06:00.000Z	simplexio	WIGGMPk	make oldconfig, make-kpkg ...
2009-06-10T12:06:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	simplexio	but you had a problem installing 2.6.29?
2009-06-10T12:07:00.000Z	simplexio	WIGGMPk	i have had that problem sine 2..28.3
2009-06-10T12:07:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	simplexio	AWESOME, the --force-all option worked.. its going thru the config..
2009-06-10T12:07:00.000Z	simplexio	WIGGMPk	it fails on some post-install process
2009-06-10T12:07:00.000Z	simplexio	WIGGMPk	and keep old kernel there too
2009-06-10T12:07:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	simplexio	what "make oldconfig" is that were your problem was?
2009-06-10T12:08:00.000Z	simplexio	WIGGMPk	what is kernelcheck
2009-06-10T12:08:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	simplexio	kernelcheck is a piece of software that Master Kernel wrote to auto download and compile kernels (newbie friendly)
2009-06-10T12:09:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	simplexio	is it safe to get rid of everything in /usr/src even my current kernel headers?
2009-06-10T12:09:00.000Z	simplexio	WIGGMPk	i make my kernels that old way, and then using make-kpkg to ubuntu .deb
2009-06-10T12:09:00.000Z	simplexio	WIGGMPk	make mrproper is safe to do after compile in linux source dir
2009-06-10T12:10:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	simplexio	you should check out the forum post.. its just a scripted application.. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=311158
2009-06-10T12:10:00.000Z	simplexio	WIGGMPk	and probably you can remove all sources, exept those linux-headers dirs, you need headers if you need to compile more stuff that kernel
2009-06-10T12:11:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	simplexio	im still getting an error
