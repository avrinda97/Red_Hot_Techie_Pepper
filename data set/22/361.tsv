2011-11-21T23:31:00.000Z	TK5791		does anyone kn ow of a good site for Unity themes?
2011-11-21T23:32:00.000Z	TK5791		so no one knows how to disable the login keyring
2011-11-21T23:32:00.000Z	TK5791		?
2011-11-21T23:34:00.000Z	TK5791		I'm used to using Win XP
2011-11-21T23:34:00.000Z	arrrghhh	TK5791	look for keyrings i guess?
2011-11-21T23:35:00.000Z	arrrghhh	TK5791	that's not a simple answer.  /bin is where most of your "programs" are.  or /usr/bin rather.
2011-11-21T23:36:00.000Z	arrrghhh	TK5791	if you put in no password for the keyring initially, it'll never ask again -_-
2011-11-21T23:36:00.000Z	TK5791	arrrghhh	thanks
2011-11-21T23:37:00.000Z	TK5791	arrrghhh	too late for that
2011-11-21T23:37:00.000Z	arrrghhh	TK5791	i assume you can clear it out, i don't know how that works in detail tho.
2011-11-21T23:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh	TK5791	perhaps you should reinstall yourself?  might learn something too.
2011-11-21T23:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh	TK5791	i like ubuntu with gnome-session-fallback
2011-11-21T23:40:00.000Z	arrrghhh	TK5791	he was whispering sweet nothings in your ear
2011-11-21T23:40:00.000Z	TK5791	arrrghhh	oh how exciting
2011-11-21T23:40:00.000Z	arrrghhh	TK5791	i can tell you're riveted
2011-11-21T23:41:00.000Z	TK5791	arrrghhh	more like frustrated
2011-11-21T23:41:00.000Z	arrrghhh	TK5791	if you don't like linux, no one is forcing you to use it
2011-11-21T23:42:00.000Z	arrrghhh	TK5791	distribution.  ubuntu is a distribution of linux.
2011-11-21T23:42:00.000Z	arrrghhh	TK5791	that's fine.  searching&reading is your best friend.
2011-11-21T23:42:00.000Z	arrrghhh	TK5791	ubuntu is pretty user-friendly.
