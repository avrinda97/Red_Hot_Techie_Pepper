2008-12-10T03:23:00.000Z	malcom2073		Yeah I got it, running now
2008-12-10T03:24:00.000Z	malcom2073		The only ATI driver it shows, I have and is enabled apparently
2008-12-10T03:25:00.000Z	malcom2073		ok, so apparently I already have the envyng driver, and it has problems too
2008-12-10T03:26:00.000Z	malcom2073		So, nobody else knows of any other ATI drivers than the open source repo ones, and the ATI proprietary ones?
2008-12-10T03:27:00.000Z	malcom2073		It's a card
2008-12-10T03:27:00.000Z	malcom2073		oh

2008-12-10T03:29:00.000Z	B3z3rk3r	malcom2073	yeah, in future nvidia is the way to go.. they simply ahve better support for their products

2008-12-10T03:29:00.000Z	B3z3rk3r	malcom2073	hmm...
2008-12-10T03:30:00.000Z	B3z3rk3r	malcom2073	have u tried the forums?
2008-12-10T03:31:00.000Z	B3z3rk3r	malcom2073	true, but would u rather ahve wobbly windows?  :P
2008-12-10T03:34:00.000Z	B3z3rk3r	malcom2073	im seeing lots of black screen issues from the X1950
2008-12-10T03:35:00.000Z	B3z3rk3r	malcom2073	your not getting that right?
2008-12-10T03:35:00.000Z	malcom2073	B3z3rk3r	Right. I'm getting 3d being borked (polygons flying all over the place, really weird), and 2d is overlaying over the entire desktop flashing at its regular framerate, but being overwritten by a window. Very epileptic seizure like.
2008-12-10T03:36:00.000Z	B3z3rk3r	malcom2073	wow.. thats pretty crazy sounding. Havent come across anything like that on th forums yet
2008-12-10T03:37:00.000Z	malcom2073	B3z3rk3r	I've seen the polygon problem before in older games when you have a REALLY outdated video card, but never in anything modern.
2008-12-10T03:37:00.000Z	B3z3rk3r	malcom2073	Gl man
