2008-12-31T15:47:00.000Z	kernan		yes!
2008-12-31T15:47:00.000Z	kernan		i have 2 hdds unallocated
2008-12-31T15:47:00.000Z	bidossessi	kernan	is there a reason you want to format your hdds using ntfs?
2008-12-31T15:48:00.000Z	bidossessi	kernan	that's a windows format. linux has losts of other formats available.what do you intend to keep on them?
2008-12-31T15:49:00.000Z	bidossessi	kernan	do you want to store like video files on them, or something?
2008-12-31T15:50:00.000Z	bidossessi	kernan	then ext3 is perfect for you. it's a journaling file system that works quite well (fyi, ntfs is also a journaling file system but it's exclusively used by windows NTsystems)
2008-12-31T15:52:00.000Z	kernan	bidossessi	heh thanks thats what i wanted to know!
2008-12-31T15:52:00.000Z	bidossessi	kernan	welcome :)
2008-12-31T15:52:00.000Z	kernan	bidossessi	after i formatted my drive i cannot find it!
2008-12-31T15:54:00.000Z	bidossessi	kernan	partitions are mounted in linux. they don't appear automatically. to "see" your partition, as in write stuff to it, you'd need to mount it somewhere, preferably in your home folder, if you're the only one using the system
2008-12-31T15:55:00.000Z	kernan	bidossessi	how can i mount it?
2008-12-31T15:56:00.000Z	kernan	bidossessi	when i click places shouldnt i see the drive??
2008-12-31T15:58:00.000Z	bidossessi	kernan	windows and linux don't hadnle drives the same way. linux doesn't care about drives. it cares about partitions, and mount points. you can easily combine two drives under one folder using mount (as sub folders, of course) and mount a drive anywhere
2008-12-31T15:59:00.000Z	kernan	bidossessi	well when i click computer i see it says SCSI DRIVE and filesytem i can click on the filesystem but the scsi sais it wont mount!
2008-12-31T16:54:00.000Z	bidossessi	kernan	as easy or hard as you are ready to learn drupal programming.
