2011-06-10T19:54:00.000Z	julie	Sahar	is your new ubuntu install using the same partitions (or installed over) your 7 partition?
2011-06-10T19:56:00.000Z	julie	Sahar	giving us the output you get from mount and "fdisk -l" could help
2011-06-10T19:59:00.000Z	julie	Sahar	use http://paste.ubuntu.com as mentionned by the bot
2011-06-10T20:00:00.000Z	julie	Sahar	unfortunately missed the main information so paste it on http://paste.ubuntu.com and give us the link
2011-06-10T20:06:00.000Z	julie	Sahar	which partition were you planning to use?  I don't see any empty space there although some partitions are not mounted
2011-06-10T20:08:00.000Z	julie	Sahar	you have to keep in mind that the extended partition is just a mapping partition and it is allocated in the partitions that follow it
2011-06-10T20:09:00.000Z	julie	Sahar	partitions sda5-8 are mapped on the extended partition and are all of Linux types
2011-06-10T20:10:00.000Z	julie	Sahar	so there doesn't seem to be any remaining Windows partitions
2011-06-10T20:16:00.000Z	julie	Sahar	I would suggest you boot in fedora from a restore / install disk and redo its boot configuration to be on the partition itself instead of the mbr, then restart in ubuntu and configure grub to just boot off that partition as a new menu entry...  there are other ways to do it but this is the simplest I can think of
2011-06-10T20:20:00.000Z	julie	Sahar	no you just boot it with the install / restore disk and redo the boot configuration
2011-06-10T20:20:00.000Z	Sahar	julie	pls say clear
2011-06-10T20:21:00.000Z	julie	Sahar	unfortunately I don't know the exact steps to take in Fedora and this would be off-topic here
