2006-09-22T09:55:00.000Z	TheH		Anyone please to point me where to configure my 6600gt component video to work with my hdtv please
2006-09-22T09:55:00.000Z	TheH		anyone that has done this with video cards?
2006-09-22T09:57:00.000Z	TheH		I don;t know where to start
2006-09-22T09:57:00.000Z	TheH		I did a lot on fedira all I could get was to make it look good in 720p but only in a 4:3 kinda screen
2006-09-22T09:59:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	naw....someone would've done far worse than that
2006-09-22T10:03:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	I have widescreen, 540p (which is the same fundamentally as 1080i).
2006-09-22T10:04:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	running from composite, mythtv with an HDTV tuner card.
2006-09-22T10:04:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	I had 1080i running for a while, but I switched back to 540p because it seems to take less cpu but is identical in quality.
2006-09-22T10:07:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	let me see if I can dig up the guide I used....
2006-09-22T10:08:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	ah yes, this is for Fedora, but it woks for us too.  http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/mythhd.php.  I just kept messing with the line until I got what I wanted, because I don't have any Windows machines to run Powerstrip.
2006-09-22T10:09:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	no, 720p is better than either 1080i or 540p.  But I don't have that.
2006-09-22T10:10:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	so if you can get 720p, go for that.
2006-09-22T10:12:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	sec, I'll tell you how to troubleshoot
2006-09-22T10:15:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	okay, how I troubleshot that was, I ran "startx -- -logverbose"  (yes, exactly like that).  Then, check your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2006-09-22T10:16:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	oops, wait
2006-09-22T10:16:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	"startx -- -logverbose 5" sorry, I left off the 5 before.
2006-09-22T10:16:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	it will tell you why it wouldn't run a particular modeline.
2006-09-22T10:22:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	the X.org stuff works pretty much the same as Fedora, if that's what you mean.
2006-09-22T10:25:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	sorry, I know nothing about that option.
2006-09-22T10:26:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	most likely, that should work on ubuntu if it works on Fedora, esp since Ubuntu uses a newer X.org I think.
2006-09-22T10:26:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	yes, I did mode blocks, but its the same to X.
2006-09-22T10:32:00.000Z	carpediem	TheH	I have to hit the sack.  If you are unsuccessful, send me a private message, or you can email me at dmartin@dmartin.org and I will try to help.
