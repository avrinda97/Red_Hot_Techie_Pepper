2008-04-25T04:53:00.000Z	jwwadk	Dason	right, but the power management options to change it have disappeared
2008-04-25T04:53:00.000Z	Dason		Just compile your own Upgrade!
2008-04-25T04:53:00.000Z	Dason		lol jk
2008-04-25T04:53:00.000Z	Dason	jwwadk	let me look into this
2008-04-25T04:53:00.000Z	jwwadk		thanks
2008-04-25T04:55:00.000Z	Dason	jwwadk	What version are you using again, and where do you find YOUR brightness settings?
2008-04-25T04:55:00.000Z	Dason		normally
2008-04-25T04:56:00.000Z	jwwadk	Dason	I'm using 8.04 (upgraded today, love it except for this problem), and I can't seem to find my monitor settings. Since upgrading, the hotkeys on my laptop for changing brightness do not work, and the brightness options have disappeared from power management
2008-04-25T04:56:00.000Z	Dason	jwwadk	Yea I noticed that too. You may have to re-enable that
2008-04-25T04:57:00.000Z	jwwadk	Dason	do you know how I would do that?
2008-04-25T04:57:00.000Z	Dason		18.2x is a permissible write speed
2008-04-25T04:58:00.000Z	Dason	jwwadk	U will be back soon, I need to restart here
