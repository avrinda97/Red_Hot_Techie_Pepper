2010-04-03T09:48:00.000Z	zenta		hello i tried to install software and i extract the file then type ./configure but give me bash: ./configure: No such file or directory
2010-04-03T09:49:00.000Z	zenta		any body can help
2010-04-03T09:50:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	is there a configure script in the directory?
2010-04-03T09:52:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	are you working from the terminal?
2010-04-03T09:54:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	and then "make install"
2010-04-03T09:54:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	first "make", then "make install"
2010-04-03T09:54:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	when make is done
2010-04-03T09:57:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	is there a makefile in the directory?
2010-04-03T09:59:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	make should be included by default
2010-04-03T10:00:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	are you just typing "make" at the prompt? only "make", not "./make" or "./configure make" or anything else?
2010-04-03T10:04:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	if there is no configure script or makefile, is the program already compiled?  are you sure you downloaded sources?
2010-04-03T10:07:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	give me a moment, i'm downloading the file, will take a look at what's inside
2010-04-03T10:08:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	this is not source code, so you don't need to configure or make it or anything.  there's a binary inside, simply type "./hacker-evolution"
2010-04-03T10:13:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	ah, well now we're on to different issues... you don't have the necessary dependencies installed.  try "sudo apt-get install libsdl-image1.2"
2010-04-03T10:18:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	aha, now try "sudo apt-get install libsdl-mixer1.2"
2010-04-03T10:24:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	did you type exactly this line: "sudo apt-get install libsdl-mixer1.2"
2010-04-03T10:24:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	don't type "libSDL_mixer1.2", type "libsdl-mixer1.2"
2010-04-03T10:28:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	great, have fun
2010-04-03T10:29:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	no problem, all have to learn at some point
2010-04-03T10:31:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	if you download source, it will usually say so on the links you click on, and furthermore in the directory you download you'll find files full of source code, as well as scripts like "configure" and files like "Makefile"
2010-04-03T10:36:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	no, from now on just type "./hacker-evolution" in the directory where the game isâˆ«
2010-04-03T10:37:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	zenta	haha, great ;)
