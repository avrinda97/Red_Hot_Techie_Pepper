2006-12-21T14:24:00.000Z	square		hi, i'm using a laptop with a dual graphics card in it, but the secondary screen isn't always liked, does anyone have an idea about setting up dual graphics cards? its an intel card
2006-12-21T14:26:00.000Z	square		poo
2006-12-21T14:27:00.000Z	square		can i ask a poll? what is better for you - GNOME, KDE, or XFCE?
2006-12-21T14:28:00.000Z	square		i dont get XFCE, its too much like mac, and it has limited options ive found
2006-12-21T14:28:00.000Z	nilleso	square	what options are you missing?
2006-12-21T14:28:00.000Z	square		i dont use it
2006-12-21T14:28:00.000Z	square		but you get things missing like add/remove programs etc.
2006-12-21T14:29:00.000Z	square		basic things included in ubuntu on gnome
2006-12-21T14:29:00.000Z	nilleso		you can run gnome-apps in xfce, without the weight of the full WM
2006-12-21T14:29:00.000Z	square		i have to admit, linux does run better than windows in its own way
2006-12-21T14:30:00.000Z	square		except when i was copying music to my mp3 player, it moved the music rather than copy generally because the root was thru /media
2006-12-21T14:31:00.000Z	square		well thats one for XFCE and 1 for nothing lol
2006-12-21T14:31:00.000Z	nilleso		yay XFCE rocks
2006-12-21T14:31:00.000Z	square	nilleso	- hehe
2006-12-21T14:32:00.000Z	square		i know this may seem stupid, but in what ways does a mac compare to ubuntu?
2006-12-21T14:32:00.000Z	square		yeh, i like that
2006-12-21T14:32:00.000Z	square		hydrogen is a good drum simulator
2006-12-21T14:34:00.000Z	square		what do people prefer to play music?
2006-12-21T14:34:00.000Z	square		or to have a library of music
2006-12-21T14:34:00.000Z	square		ah rhythmbox blew out on me twice
2006-12-21T14:34:00.000Z	square		im using Amarok, it resembles windows media player quite a bit, but is better in library
2006-12-21T14:35:00.000Z	nilleso	square	I'm using Helix Banshee... guess it's not FOSS though
