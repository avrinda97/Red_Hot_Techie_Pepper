2007-06-18T14:07:00.000Z	assasukasse		i killalled ssh-agent how can i respawn it?
2007-06-18T14:09:00.000Z	elias_	assasukasse	eval `ssh-agent`
2007-06-18T14:09:00.000Z	assasukasse	elias_	is there any way to make ssh-agent start at bootup and keep the user added?
2007-06-18T14:10:00.000Z	assasukasse	elias_	thanks i will give a look
2007-06-18T14:12:00.000Z	assasukasse	elias_	i have a remote computer that spawns a reverse ssh tunnel on my machine, i wish to keep ssh with password, so the way is ssh-agent...but if someone reboots, i want it to keep the passphrase cached so that i don't have to add myself..does seahorse do?
2007-06-18T14:13:00.000Z	elias_	assasukasse	the problem is that caching this key over reboot is insecure
2007-06-18T14:13:00.000Z	assasukasse	elias_	i know but still more secure than having a passphraseless key..vulnerable to mim
2007-06-18T14:13:00.000Z	elias_	assasukasse	you can make an uncrypted key
2007-06-18T14:14:00.000Z	assasukasse	elias_	i didnt get
2007-06-18T14:14:00.000Z	elias_	assasukasse	hm the gentoo guys made a tool called keychain maybe that will help
2007-06-18T14:15:00.000Z	assasukasse	elias_	i will give a look thanks!
2007-06-18T14:15:00.000Z	elias_	assasukasse	forget seahorse thats for gui and local use
2007-06-18T14:17:00.000Z	elias_	assasukasse	maybe openvpn is the right solution for you
2007-06-18T14:24:00.000Z	assasukasse	elias_	i was looking into hamachi
2007-06-18T14:24:00.000Z	elias_	assasukasse	 whats that?
2007-06-18T14:25:00.000Z	assasukasse	elias_	something like openvpn
2007-06-18T14:25:00.000Z	elias_	assasukasse	hm openvpn is easy to configure
2007-06-18T14:26:00.000Z	assasukasse	elias_	is it included in ubuntu repo?
2007-06-18T14:27:00.000Z	elias_	assasukasse	jep
2007-06-18T14:27:00.000Z	elias_	assasukasse	http://openvpn.net/
2007-06-18T14:31:00.000Z	assasukasse	elias_	do u know if openvpn works tru firewalls or nats?
2007-06-18T14:36:00.000Z	elias_	assasukasse	should work
