2011-09-04T17:57:00.000Z	zappus		will there be any noticable difference if i get a netbook with ssd instead of hdd for ubuntu?
2011-09-04T17:58:00.000Z	zappus		is it worth the extra cost? :P

2011-09-04T17:59:00.000Z	Gentoo64	zappus	check the ssd though some are slow, some are amazingly fast
2011-09-04T17:59:00.000Z	zappus		ok fair enough :D
2011-09-04T18:00:00.000Z	Gentoo64	zappus	are you from uk?
2011-09-04T18:00:00.000Z	zappus		no, im from canada :P
2011-09-04T18:00:00.000Z	zappus		why?
2011-09-04T18:00:00.000Z	Gentoo64	zappus	i was going to say in the uk some good offer on ssd
2011-09-04T18:01:00.000Z	Gentoo64	zappus	you can always buy the laptop with a hdd then buy a decent ssd
2011-09-04T18:01:00.000Z	Gentoo64		vertex 2 is very good and cheap
2011-09-04T18:01:00.000Z	zappus	Gentoo64	well im thinking of getting thinkpad x1 or x200
2011-09-04T18:01:00.000Z	zappus		both offer ssd as an option
2011-09-04T18:01:00.000Z	Gentoo64		i dont know naything about laptops tbh. work out the price with/without the ssd, if the ssds decent go for it
2011-09-04T18:01:00.000Z	zappus		but i lose 160gb and pay extra 300$
2011-09-04T18:01:00.000Z	Gentoo64		if not get the hdd one and fork out little extra for good ssd
2011-09-04T18:02:00.000Z	Gentoo64		you will always lose disk space, but the ssd benefits make up for it loads
2011-09-04T18:02:00.000Z	Gentoo64		think about it theyre ideal for laptop
2011-09-04T18:02:00.000Z	zappus		ok then im sticking with ssd :D
2011-09-04T18:02:00.000Z	zappus		yeah thats true
2011-09-04T18:02:00.000Z	zappus		besides i don't really need that much space on a netbook anyway
2011-09-04T18:03:00.000Z	zappus	Gentoo64	what would you say about gorrila glass screen?
