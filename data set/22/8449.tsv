2005-08-08T12:18:00.000Z	ompaul	KamiVIP	how are you phrasing the command to install build_essential
2005-08-08T12:18:00.000Z	KamiVIP	ompaul	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2005-08-08T12:19:00.000Z	ompaul	KamiVIP	so first do apt-get update then try again
2005-08-08T12:20:00.000Z	KamiVIP	ompaul	i tried that i get same message
2005-08-08T12:20:00.000Z	KamiVIP	ompaul	i get same message aswel if it ry to install g++
2005-08-08T12:20:00.000Z	ompaul	KamiVIP	hmm

2005-08-08T12:22:00.000Z	KamiVIP	ompaul	i don't have problems with other packages its strange
2005-08-08T12:22:00.000Z	KamiVIP		oh sorry
2005-08-08T12:22:00.000Z	KamiVIP		didnt read whore line:))
2005-08-08T12:22:00.000Z	ompaul	KamiVIP	there is one option left that I know of and I am loath to suggest it - check the help file to understand its implications - apt-get -f install build-essential
2005-08-08T12:23:00.000Z	KamiVIP	ompaul	0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 3 not upgraded.
2005-08-08T12:24:00.000Z	KamiVIP	ompaul	so it looks like there are no corrupted packages
2005-08-08T12:24:00.000Z	ompaul	KamiVIP	I have no other suggestions at this time, sorry I could not be of more help
2005-08-08T12:25:00.000Z	ompaul	KamiVIP	you could try a different repository
2005-08-08T12:25:00.000Z	KamiVIP		k np
2005-08-08T12:25:00.000Z	ompaul	KamiVIP	I have no good reason for suggesting this other than doing nothing seems like a wasted opportunity
2005-08-08T12:26:00.000Z	ompaul	KamiVIP	biab
