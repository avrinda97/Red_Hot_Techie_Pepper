2007-09-18T14:12:00.000Z	redheat		simply put, there are folder called .gnome and .gnome 2 which are located under the root folder
2007-09-18T14:12:00.000Z	h1st0	redheat	your user isn't able to see the folders in there.
2007-09-18T14:12:00.000Z	h1st0	redheat	what are you trying to do?
2007-09-18T14:12:00.000Z	h1st0	redheat	hit ctrl+h in nautilus
2007-09-18T14:13:00.000Z	h1st0	redheat	in the file browser folders with . in front are hidden.
2007-09-18T14:13:00.000Z	h1st0	redheat	also you shouldn't really be logged in as root but thats another issue.
2007-09-18T14:13:00.000Z	h1st0	redheat	yeap
2007-09-18T14:14:00.000Z	h1st0	redheat	its more than a security issue
2007-09-18T14:14:00.000Z	h1st0	redheat	you just enter the root password and do that.
2007-09-18T14:15:00.000Z	h1st0	redheat	no.
2007-09-18T14:15:00.000Z	h1st0	redheat	its nothing like windows.
2007-09-18T14:16:00.000Z	h1st0	redheat	use your normal user acount and if you want to install drivers or software it will prompt you for root password.  You enter it and away it goes.
2007-09-18T14:16:00.000Z	h1st0	redheat	you need to read the link from ubotu about sudo
