2008-04-22T06:32:00.000Z	MiYaRSTiM	newbie	how far
2008-04-22T06:33:00.000Z	newbie	MiYaRSTiM	about 100 mts
2008-04-22T06:34:00.000Z	MiYaRSTiM	newbie	is an external usb wifi out of the question
2008-04-22T06:35:00.000Z	newbie	MiYaRSTiM	I did not understand your question :( - I am using a pcmcia card
2008-04-22T06:36:00.000Z	MiYaRSTiM	newbie	ah, laptop, I use minipci in laptop at home but when i ned range i use external usb adapeter
2008-04-22T06:37:00.000Z	newbie	MiYaRSTiM	the thing is that I do not want to buy another wireless card. If my card worked on ubuntu 7.10, It must work on 8.04 in some way
2008-04-22T06:39:00.000Z	MiYaRSTiM	newbie	I use alpha networks usb awus036h with various antennas, very impressive
2008-04-22T06:40:00.000Z	MiYaRSTiM	newbie	depends on needs though
2008-04-22T06:40:00.000Z	newbie	MiYaRSTiM	what is the estimated range you can cover with your adapter?
2008-04-22T06:40:00.000Z	MiYaRSTiM	newbie	i have atheros based 400mw mini pci in laptop
2008-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	MiYaRSTiM	newbie	lol, with my 1m parabolic (and same antenna at other end) its alledgedly 41km
2008-04-22T06:42:00.000Z	MiYaRSTiM	newbie	I get a couple of km when connecting to ordinary wifi routers
2008-04-22T06:42:00.000Z	newbie	MiYaRSTiM	really??? You showld get 1000s of signals, don't you? And what about the quality of the signal?
2008-04-22T06:42:00.000Z	MiYaRSTiM	newbie	depends whats in the way
2008-04-22T06:43:00.000Z	MiYaRSTiM	newbie	its very directional
2008-04-22T06:43:00.000Z	MiYaRSTiM	newbie	but i can connect to about 20 from where i am
2008-04-22T06:44:00.000Z	MiYaRSTiM	newbie	problem is target systems use crappy routers and antennas
2008-04-22T06:44:00.000Z	newbie	MiYaRSTiM	so that means that you are in a region where wireless networks are not quite available?
2008-04-22T06:44:00.000Z	MiYaRSTiM	newbie	yes and no, my antenna is pointing away from local town, just the way my workshop is situated in my house
2008-04-22T06:45:00.000Z	MiYaRSTiM	newbie	i have been out and about with it though, and it is amazing what you can get
2008-04-22T06:46:00.000Z	MiYaRSTiM	newbie	the awus036h is 500mw (depending on antenna) and i do have it running under ubuntu and slax
2008-04-22T06:48:00.000Z	newbie	MiYaRSTiM	neat!
