2011-02-07T01:34:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	no thanks
2011-02-07T01:34:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	this is an ubuntu support channel
2011-02-07T01:35:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	you're already in it
2011-02-07T01:35:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	please don't play dumb
2011-11-20T23:33:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	you've been getting help
2011-11-20T23:33:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	did you read the screen tutorial/basics as suggested
2011-11-20T23:34:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	you're running a terminal - that's the blank session you see
2011-11-20T23:34:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	that is a new shell for you to use
2011-11-20T23:34:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	that's a different situation and more complex
2011-11-20T23:35:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	you'd need to launch a session on the machine when it boots up underscreen control, then connect to that later.
2011-11-20T23:35:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	if you read the screen tutorial you'll get an idea of what people are tryig to explain to you
2011-11-20T23:36:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	depends on the java application
2011-11-20T23:36:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	if it is a terminal driven application, sure
2011-11-20T23:36:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	ssh in, start a screen session, launch minecraft, disconnect the screen session
2011-11-20T23:37:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	it will be fine
2011-11-20T23:38:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	yes
2011-11-20T23:38:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	nothing, READ the screen basics
2011-11-20T23:39:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	it will die
2011-11-20T23:39:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	I'm not helping you any more - you refuse to read the screen basics that would answer this in about 15 minutes
2011-11-20T23:39:00.000Z	ikonia	WinCamXP	no - I'm done
