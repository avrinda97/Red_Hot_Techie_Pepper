2009-12-22T16:51:00.000Z	bigdavjoker		looking for linux tools to fix Vista boot files  I recently had to use gparted to copy partitions from a HD getting ready to fail.  I can now boot into my ubuntu partion fine but when I try and boot vista from grub it simply restarts the laptop
2009-12-22T16:52:00.000Z	bigdavjoker		The only suggestions I've found so far from googling are to try and delete the recovary partion
2009-12-22T16:53:00.000Z	Younder	bigdavjoker	you are looking at the wrong thing.. Windows has two boot partions. If one fails the other takes it's place
2009-12-22T16:55:00.000Z	bigdavjoker	Younder	sorry I'm not sure I follow you
2009-12-22T16:55:00.000Z	Younder	bigdavjoker	what loader is it looking for Vista or CP
2009-12-22T16:55:00.000Z	Younder		XP
2009-12-22T16:55:00.000Z	bigdavjoker	Younder	what is CP?
2009-12-22T16:56:00.000Z	Younder		XP
2009-12-22T16:56:00.000Z	Younder		missed a key
2009-12-22T16:56:00.000Z	bigdavjoker	Younder	 I'm using grub which sees the vista partition
2009-12-22T16:56:00.000Z	Younder		well it sees a vista partion for xp too, but it succed in booting on my macine
2009-12-22T16:57:00.000Z	bigdavjoker	Younder	 okay it also sees my recovery partition but won't boot it either says something about missing /boot/bcd
2009-12-22T16:58:00.000Z	bigdavjoker	Younder	so I was guessing that maybe something in the boot files for vista partition was screwed up  but can't figure out how tot try and check or fix and I don't have a vista CD handy to try and fix the install
2009-12-22T16:59:00.000Z	Younder	bigdavjoker	that's my point Vista is fine, it is GRUB that f.... up
2009-12-22T16:59:00.000Z	bigdavjoker	Younder	sorry a bit slow this morning
2009-12-22T17:00:00.000Z	bigdavjoker	Younder	I got  grub to start booting the vista once it flashed the windows screen with the progress bar then when blank and rebooted
2009-12-22T17:00:00.000Z	Younder		ok so look at the grub config at /boot/grub.mnu
2009-12-22T17:02:00.000Z	Younder	bigdavjoker	/boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-12-22T17:03:00.000Z	bigdavjoker	Younder	I'm using 9.10 with grub2 so no menu.lst   update-grub does find the vista partition not sure how to edit it from there
2009-12-22T17:05:00.000Z	Younder	bigdavjoker	I also use 9.10 and i edit menu.lst all the time.. try 'locate menu.lst'
2009-12-22T17:12:00.000Z	Younder	bigdavjoker	grub2 also uses menu.lst
2009-12-22T17:12:00.000Z	Younder	bigdavjoker	(I had to check)
