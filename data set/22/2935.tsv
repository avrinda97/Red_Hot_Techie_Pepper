2009-03-09T17:01:00.000Z	bazhang	clarks	additionally is this a dual boot, and/or does the wifi have a kill switch
2009-03-09T17:01:00.000Z	clarks	bazhang	i think it can be fixed in terminal..but i forget the command..like modprobe and rmmod
2009-03-09T17:02:00.000Z	clarks	bazhang	it have kill switch..
2009-03-09T17:02:00.000Z	bazhang	clarks	make sure it is not set to off when you have booted
2009-03-09T17:02:00.000Z	clarks	bazhang	thats why i dont know how to know if it is on or off
2009-03-09T17:02:00.000Z	clarks	bazhang	i have to booted?
2009-03-09T17:03:00.000Z	bazhang	clarks	may take a bit of experimentation then :)
2009-03-09T17:03:00.000Z	bazhang	clarks	also the computer manual may have instructions as well
2009-03-09T17:09:00.000Z	bazhang	clarks	did you reboot with the kill switch set to -->wifi on?
