2009-05-12T09:27:00.000Z	agoole		I just locked up my computer (printscreen key was jammed) and now I can load up my login...its stuck at the world icon in kde, anyone help ?
2009-05-12T09:29:00.000Z	agoole		does anyone how I can force a disk scan ? instead of waiting the allocated boot-times ?
2009-05-12T09:30:00.000Z	chuck_	agoole	fdisk in terminal will give you options
2009-05-12T09:31:00.000Z	agoole	chuck_	I just zapped my system, and now it won't boot...do you think this might fix it ?
2009-05-12T09:32:00.000Z	chuck_	agoole	by boot into system what do you mean can you get a terminl
