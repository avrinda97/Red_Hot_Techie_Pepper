2009-05-23T22:44:00.000Z	shabyasachi		Hello everyone!
2009-05-23T22:44:00.000Z	shabyasachi		Hi. I have two NIC on my desktop. One 100Mbps, other One 1Gbps (I think). 100mbps works fine with the cable that I am using but 1gbps does not. However the 1gbps card works fine with other cables. Can anyone please tell me why this may happen?
2009-05-23T22:44:00.000Z	nathan7	shabyasachi	Maybe the cable is broken internally.
2009-05-23T22:45:00.000Z	shabyasachi	nathan7	I thought so too. But it does work with the older NIC. I also tried to plug the cable in my asus eee 901. That also does not work with the cable.
2009-05-23T22:46:00.000Z	nathan7	shabyasachi	The extra lines are broken.
2009-05-23T22:46:00.000Z	nathan7	shabyasachi	These arent used on the older 100mbit nic.
2009-05-23T22:47:00.000Z	shabyasachi	nathan7	any way around that? Can I switch the NIC to some mode so that it does not use those extra lines?
2009-05-23T22:47:00.000Z	nathan7	shabyasachi	Guess so.
2009-05-23T22:47:00.000Z	nathan7	shabyasachi	Try ifconfig manpages.
2009-05-23T22:47:00.000Z	nathan7	shabyasachi	Or #ubuntu
2009-05-23T22:48:00.000Z	shabyasachi	nathan7	I used 'ethtool -S' on both the cards. And the gbps one has a lot more info than the 100mbps one.
2009-05-23T22:48:00.000Z	shabyasachi	nathan7	Okay. I will read up the ifconfig man page.
2009-05-23T22:48:00.000Z	nathan7	shabyasachi	More advanced eh?
2009-05-23T22:48:00.000Z	nathan7	shabyasachi	Oh, ethtool manpages might be of interest too
2009-05-23T22:49:00.000Z	shabyasachi	nathan7	I am no expert. And the ethtool manpage seems pretty cryptic to me :)
2009-05-23T22:49:00.000Z	nathan7	shabyasachi	Manpages are cryptic per definition ;)
2009-05-23T22:50:00.000Z	shabyasachi	nathan7	Guess so :)
2009-05-23T22:50:00.000Z	nathan7	shabyasachi	I'll have a look
2009-05-23T22:50:00.000Z	shabyasachi	nathan7	Thanks a lot. Do you need some more info on the card configs?
2009-05-23T22:57:00.000Z	nathan7	shabyasachi	Sorry, can't help you atm
2009-05-23T23:02:00.000Z	shabyasachi	nathan7	Thanks anyways. You have been real helpful. :)
