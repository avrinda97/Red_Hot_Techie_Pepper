2007-05-12T06:40:00.000Z	VSpike		How would I got about changing the boot priority of my hard drives?  I mean, I know how to do it in the BIOS, but how will it affect my grub setup, and my system?
2007-05-12T06:40:00.000Z	VSpike		I assume I need to do "sudo grub-install hdN" to install grub on the relevant disk
2007-05-12T06:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	VSpike	 yep - somthing like that.
2007-05-12T06:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	VSpike	 device map i dont think should change.
2007-05-12T06:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	VSpike	 but i do recall on some old pc's that if they had a special 'boot menu in the bios'  that i could select what pc to boot. that they may swap the hd's about. But i only had 1 pc like that.
2007-05-12T06:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	VSpike	 hda should always be hda. you can 'swap' them around with some grub optiuons
2007-05-12T06:42:00.000Z	VSpike	Dr_willis	well, it should be safe to try it out I think
2007-05-12T06:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	VSpike	 yep. Grub is omne of those tools that is well worth reading/learning all about.
2007-05-12T06:43:00.000Z	VSpike	Dr_willis	You can control how grub maps its device names (hd0, hd1, hd2..) to linux devices (hda, hdb, sda..)
2007-05-12T06:43:00.000Z	VSpike	Dr_willis	/boot/grub/device.map controls that
2007-05-12T06:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	VSpike	 not actually tried that. :) but ages ago i had to swap the 2nd and first hd's in gryb to make windows95 happy.
2007-05-12T06:44:00.000Z	VSpike	Dr_willis	I had to learn about it when my clean install of feisty into a spare partition failed to install grub
2007-05-12T06:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	VSpike	 of course some day soon they will all be sd## that will be a lot of confuseion.
2007-05-12T06:46:00.000Z	VSpike	Dr_willis	I think it was an installer bug... I tried to add my new install to my existing grub (from edgy) and found the problem.  The installed had reformatted the partition as ext3 but had left the partition type in the table as ntfs
2007-05-12T06:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	VSpike	 seen a similer bug to that befor also. :)
2007-05-12T06:46:00.000Z	VSpike	Dr_willis	these things are always a pita at the time, but you come out knowing more about something :) education through adversity lol
2007-05-12T06:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	VSpike	 its amazing how smart the linux installs are compared to say 2 years ago.
2007-05-12T06:47:00.000Z	VSpike	Dr_willis	yeah they are very impresive.  I installed debian in about 96 to experiment with linux and it took me weeks to get X running.. lol
2007-05-12T06:47:00.000Z	VSpike	Dr_willis	a steep learning curve for sure
2008-01-08T00:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	VSpike	 theres a lot ot extnesions for firefox that can tweak the tab/tools/settings.
2008-01-08T00:38:00.000Z	VSpike	Dr_willis	ah yeah, good point - i'll check extensions
2008-05-04T15:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	VSpike	 thats a vimrc config file setting, you may want to isntall the vim-full packages also. the vim-tiny package may not included the feature
