2009-08-03T13:30:00.000Z	WIGGMPk		is it possible to change the location of the notification window in Jaunty?
2009-08-03T13:31:00.000Z	indus	WIGGMPk	well,there is a tool to change it,but it doesnt change it though
2009-08-03T13:31:00.000Z	indus	WIGGMPk	install notify-osd and try
2009-08-03T13:31:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	indus	that package is the window if im not mistaken
2009-08-03T13:32:00.000Z	indus	WIGGMPk	ya type that in terminal and check?
2009-08-03T13:32:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	indus	no command
2009-08-03T13:32:00.000Z	indus	WIGGMPk	i vaguely recollect using it once,but notification didnt change
2009-08-03T13:32:00.000Z	indus	WIGGMPk	i believe its not istalled
2009-08-03T13:33:00.000Z	indus	WIGGMPk	you need to install it,or maybe i forget the package name
2009-08-03T13:33:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	indus	yes it is.. but to humor you, ill try to install it
2009-08-03T13:33:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	indus	notify-osd is already the newest version.
2009-08-03T13:34:00.000Z	indus	WIGGMPk	well,hmm that should work in terminal then
2009-08-03T13:37:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	indus	its interesting because I remember seeing the tool in Preferences when I first installed Jaunty
2009-08-03T13:38:00.000Z	indus	WIGGMPk	yeah,now its not in preferences?
2009-08-03T13:38:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	indus	not since the 2nd time I had to reinstall
2009-08-03T13:38:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	indus	what do you mean by scan?
2009-08-03T13:39:00.000Z	indus	WIGGMPk	try install notification daemon maybe
2009-08-03T13:39:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	indus	its going to conflict with notify-osd which is also a daemon..
2009-08-03T13:40:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	indus	try kismet if you want to scan for wireless networks
2009-08-03T13:40:00.000Z	indus	WIGGMPk	well,actually i think we cant change it
2009-08-03T13:40:00.000Z	indus	WIGGMPk	wireless? i didnt ask about that .Some other user maybe
2009-08-03T13:41:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	indus	whoops
