2008-07-08T19:24:00.000Z	bazhang	Tita1	you dont need to do it that way; that is much harder in fact

2008-07-08T19:26:00.000Z	bazhang	Tita1	that is one option the hardware drivers one; what is the card number and model nvidia (etc)
2008-07-08T19:27:00.000Z	bazhang	Tita1	the other option is envyng-gtk which does it for you; which nvidia card do you have
2008-07-08T19:28:00.000Z	bazhang	Tita1	please stay focused and avoid offtopic comments thanks
