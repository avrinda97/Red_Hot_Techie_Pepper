2005-09-28T09:40:00.000Z	cb		hi, does anyone know how to activate sleep on a laptop manually (the button on the laptop isn't working) IIRC it's something like echo 1 > /sys/power/state
2005-09-28T09:41:00.000Z	goo_	cb	cat /sys/power/state
2005-09-28T09:41:00.000Z	goo_	cb	use one of those :)
2005-09-28T09:42:00.000Z	cb	goo_	cheers
2005-09-28T09:42:00.000Z	cb	goo_	heh, now to see if it actually works ;)
2005-09-28T09:43:00.000Z	goo_	cb	good luck :) Hope you have a new and proper ACPI BIOS :)
2005-09-28T09:44:00.000Z	cb	goo_	yeah, it's a dell m70.. according to hardware support on the ubuntu wiki suspend to ram should work but not to disk
2005-09-28T09:44:00.000Z	goo_	cb	ok. My wifes Dell Inspiron 6000 actually suspends very well to disk as well
2005-09-28T09:45:00.000Z	goo_	cb	my own IBM t40p does barely even survive suspend to RAM with ACPI :)  It likes APM much better :)
2005-09-28T09:46:00.000Z	cb	goo_	have you ever tried the hibernate package (+ kernel patches)?
2005-09-28T09:46:00.000Z	goo_	cb	hm, no. I have just been using APM, and since it Just Worked [tm]  I just stuck with that
2005-09-28T09:46:00.000Z	cb	goo_	fair enough
2005-09-28T09:48:00.000Z	goo_	cb	ah, it's a hackpack. I can actually suspend-to-ram without any other hacks than acpid, but maybe I could get suspend to disk to work properly with that hibernate package...
2005-09-28T09:48:00.000Z	goo_	cb	nice tips, thanks :)
2005-09-28T09:54:00.000Z	cb	goo_	bah, it sleeps without any problems but the screen doesn't come on after resuming :(
2005-09-28T09:56:00.000Z	goo_	cb	tried hitting Fn-<the key you use for switching between LCD and CRT> ?
2005-09-28T09:56:00.000Z	goo_	cb	that's a trick that is said to light up the screen on some laptops
2005-09-28T09:58:00.000Z	cb	goo_	worth a try i guess
2005-09-28T09:58:00.000Z	cb	goo_	doing a bit of googling before trying again though
2005-09-28T09:58:00.000Z	goo_	cb	yeah, all those hard resets gives bad karma :)
2005-09-28T09:59:00.000Z	goo_		But I have a raid to initialize... bye now
2005-09-28T09:59:00.000Z	cb	goo_	lol, too right
