2006-12-17T13:09:00.000Z	stockfisch		somehow my complete network seems to be messed up
2006-12-17T13:10:00.000Z	stockfisch		azureus just crashed and kicked xchat, too
2006-12-17T13:12:00.000Z	stockfisch		i have possibly found the error...
2006-12-17T13:12:00.000Z	stockfisch		java takes 99% cpu
2006-12-17T13:12:00.000Z	stockfisch		can anyone tell how this might come?
2006-12-17T13:13:00.000Z	stockfisch		i mean how i can find out?
2006-12-17T13:13:00.000Z	stockfisch		so what can i do about that
2006-12-17T13:13:00.000Z	stockfisch		the only java prog i am running is azureus
2006-12-17T13:14:00.000Z	stockfisch		is it as easy to set up?
2006-12-17T13:15:00.000Z	stockfisch		is qbittorrent coming with a gui?
2006-12-17T13:15:00.000Z	dfcarney	stockfisch	(sorry, sent this to the wrong name before) --  "nice" the process to lower it's priority so that other (more important) processes can get the CPU time that they need.
2006-12-17T13:16:00.000Z	dfcarney	stockfisch	did you use Gnome under SuSE?
2006-12-17T13:17:00.000Z	dfcarney	stockfisch	that could be why.  Gnome also uses a lot of resources.
2006-12-17T13:18:00.000Z	dfcarney	stockfisch	yeager's suggestion to switch to another application may help
2006-12-17T13:19:00.000Z	dfcarney	stockfisch	can you get to a command prompt?  If so, type "top"  -- what's eating up all of your resources?
2006-12-17T13:20:00.000Z	dfcarney	stockfisch	have you tried nice'ing it?
2006-12-17T13:20:00.000Z	dfcarney	stockfisch	why not?  i'm curious.
2006-12-17T13:20:00.000Z	dfcarney	stockfisch	well, it's your call.
2006-12-17T13:21:00.000Z	stockfisch	dfcarney	sorry for that... this is just because i believe that it would speed up other applications, but it wont help for the seeding problem with azureus itself
2006-12-17T13:21:00.000Z	dfcarney	stockfisch	i understand.  what are your system specs?  how much RAM/swap do you have?
2006-12-17T13:23:00.000Z	dfcarney	stockfisch	and you're having performance issues?  That's crazy. :P
2006-12-17T13:23:00.000Z	dfcarney	stockfisch	'dmesg' doesn't report anything out-of-the-ordinary?
