2010-03-22T05:26:00.000Z	cecilfso		 hi people, can anyone help me? i have no sound on flash videos in any browser i try... i'm using kubuntu 9.10 on a 32 bit platform.
2010-03-22T05:26:00.000Z	Gnea	cecilfso	does sound work otherwise?
2010-03-22T05:27:00.000Z	cecilfso	Gnea	yes, it is working on amarok and kaffeine, although not on VLC
2010-03-22T05:38:00.000Z	cecilfso	Gnea	i tried everything at VLC...default configuration, alsa, OSS (which worked before), pulseaudio, etc...
2010-03-22T05:29:00.000Z	Gnea	cecilfso	perhaps pulseaudio is not setup right?
2010-03-22T05:32:00.000Z	cecilfso	Gnea	i've removed pulseaudio in order to set up things right, but nothing happened
2010-03-22T05:32:00.000Z	Gnea	cecilfso	hrm, have you checked vlc and such to make sure that it's pointing to the alsa driver?
2010-03-22T05:33:00.000Z	cecilfso	Gnea	yes, I have tried on vlc but there's no sound on whatever i choose... before, it worked when I chose OSS, but not with alsa or anything else
2010-03-22T05:37:00.000Z	Gnea	cecilfso	did you vlc to use alsa specifically, or just default?
2010-03-22T05:39:00.000Z	Gnea	cecilfso	okay, and when you choose a different audio output, are you restarting vlc?
2010-03-22T05:39:00.000Z	Gnea	cecilfso	try switching to alsa, restart vlc, and play from there
2010-03-22T05:41:00.000Z	cecilfso	Gnea	it didn't work at all
2010-03-22T05:45:00.000Z	Gnea	cecilfso	that's weird...
2010-03-22T05:45:00.000Z	Gnea	cecilfso	you're sure your user is authorized to use all audio devices?
2010-03-22T05:48:00.000Z	Gnea	cecilfso	that's not what I meant. if you go to system->admin->users & groups, you can see what access permissions you have there.
2010-03-22T05:49:00.000Z	cecilfso	Gnea	hey, i've just fixed VLC...on audio, I chose OSS and the output via soundcard, Ensoniq whatever...
2010-03-22T05:51:00.000Z	Gnea	cecilfso	awesome
2010-03-22T05:52:00.000Z	Gnea	cecilfso	although, where did you install your flash support from?
2010-03-22T05:54:00.000Z	cecilfso	Gnea	i installed the flash, at first, from the adobe site...then, as it didn't work, from synaptic, flashplugin-installer and nonfree-extrasound...
2010-03-22T05:56:00.000Z	Gnea	cecilfso	did you remove the installed version from the adobe site first?
2010-03-22T06:03:00.000Z	cecilfso	Gnea	thank you for trying to hlp me, but i have to go... maybe some other time... thanks a lot anyway...bye bye guys
2010-03-22T06:03:00.000Z	Gnea	cecilfso	good luck
