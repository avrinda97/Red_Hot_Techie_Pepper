2005-04-14T08:44:00.000Z	t3h_j4n		Can someone please help me with the install of ubuntu?
2005-04-14T08:46:00.000Z	t3h_j4n		it gets to a certain point, then it gives me the message about having only a little bit of RAM
2005-04-14T08:46:00.000Z	t3h_j4n		then I say OK and it continues only to show the message again and again
2005-04-14T08:46:00.000Z	t3h_j4n		yes
2005-04-14T08:47:00.000Z	t3h_j4n		I'm using the intelx86 warty edition
2005-04-14T08:47:00.000Z	t3h_j4n		32 Megs, pentium 2 200Mhz
2005-04-14T08:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	t3h_j4n	you need 128MB
2005-04-14T08:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	t3h_j4n	or a minimal expert install
2005-04-14T08:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	t3h_j4n	you'll be fighting all the way to get it to install - damnsmall or debian are the way to go
2005-04-14T08:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	t3h_j4n	debian is more "normal"
2005-04-14T08:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	t3h_j4n	for instance the X server is standard
2005-04-14T08:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	t3h_j4n	I know debian will run happily on a P200 mmx - I have one right next to me
2005-04-14T08:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	t3h_j4n	for a minimal install with blackbox or fluxbox, yeah
2005-04-14T08:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	t3h_j4n	and use light apps
2005-04-14T08:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	t3h_j4n	http://users.netwit.net.au/~pursang/     << good advice on lofat linux
2005-04-14T09:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	t3h_j4n	DSL would work fine, and the app choices are good
2005-04-14T09:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	t3h_j4n	scite, beaver or nedit are good on low ram machines
2005-04-14T09:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	t3h_j4n	to really confuse them, quote bbogomips ;-)
2005-04-14T09:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	t3h_j4n	supposedly a measure of how many times per sec a cpu can do nothing ;-)
2005-04-14T09:18:00.000Z	t3h_j4n	thoreauputic	The amount of irony in that sentence is enough to kill a whale
2005-04-14T09:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	t3h_j4n	I believe Linus invented the measurement and named it :)
2005-04-14T10:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	t3h_j4n	depends.. for cli  tuxfiles.org is good
