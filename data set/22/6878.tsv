2006-07-12T09:41:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		i would like to check which packages i have installed *and* which packages are installed by default so i can figure out what i've added to setup somebody else's box very similar to mine
2006-07-12T09:43:00.000Z	brainsik	ToHellWithGA	what do you mean by "default" .. during the install process you usually say what kind of packages to install
2006-07-12T09:43:00.000Z	brainsik	ToHellWithGA	the closest you could get is the list of essential packages
2006-07-12T09:43:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA	brainsik	something like that
2006-07-12T09:43:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		i know every time i install i have to get build essential and *-dev
2006-07-12T09:44:00.000Z	brainsik	ToHellWithGA	easier would just be to get your list and their list and see what's missing, don't worry about the "default"
2006-07-12T09:44:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA	brainsik	so any overlap won't cause problems?
2006-07-12T09:45:00.000Z	brainsik	ToHellWithGA	problems with what?
2006-07-12T09:45:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		such as a 386 kernel installing by default and me now using a 686smp kernel
2006-07-12T09:45:00.000Z	brainsik	ToHellWithGA	hmm
2006-07-12T09:46:00.000Z	brainsik	ToHellWithGA	my guess is there aren't many things like that.. but, it doesn't really matter if both kernels are installed
2006-07-12T09:46:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		i'd be worried that installing from a beastly list of packages could be a bad thing if some of the low-level stuff doesn't match up
2006-07-12T09:46:00.000Z	brainsik	ToHellWithGA	that's what dependencies are for :)
2006-07-12T09:47:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		.me puts his faith in dependencies and will just give it a go
2006-07-12T09:47:00.000Z	brainsik	ToHellWithGA	debian dependencies are awesome .. i assume Ubuntu is basically the same
2006-07-12T09:48:00.000Z	brainsik	ToHellWithGA	anyway, to get a list of installed packages, you can run this on the command line: dpkg -l | grep '^ii '
2006-07-12T09:48:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		thanks brainsik
2006-07-12T09:48:00.000Z	brainsik	ToHellWithGA	or this for something cleaner: dpkg -l | grep '^ii ' | cut -f 3 -d ' '
2006-07-12T09:49:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA	brainsik	does that carrot in '^ii ' indicate a new line?
2006-07-12T09:50:00.000Z	brainsik	ToHellWithGA	indicates the beginning of a line
2006-07-12T09:50:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		thanks a bundle.  you taught me a new command and a new regexp
2006-07-12T09:51:00.000Z	brainsik	ToHellWithGA	:) cool!
