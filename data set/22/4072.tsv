2008-04-27T14:56:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac		ahh tkooda i think may be able to help, just fixed mine coz my keys were not working
2008-04-27T14:57:00.000Z	tkooda	jaffarkelshac	is there an app that can dim the lcd?
2008-04-27T14:58:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	tkooda	you dont have the funtion keys to dim the brightness? what laptop is it
2008-04-27T14:59:00.000Z	tkooda		er, Dr_willis is right.. there they are.. not up in the number/F-keys, but down on the arrow keys.  (Dell D830)
2008-04-27T14:59:00.000Z	tkooda		fn-up/dn
2008-04-27T14:59:00.000Z	tkooda		don't they run some userspace app to do their job though?
2008-04-27T15:00:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac		does it still not work tkooda ?
2008-04-27T15:00:00.000Z	tkooda	jaffarkelshac	nwa.. -just couldn't see them where I was expecting them to be..  fn-up/dn works..  brings up a mini sliding bar in xfce when I hit 'em and it works.  -am curious what userspace app could also do it thought, too, if one exists

2008-04-27T15:01:00.000Z	tkooda		s/thought/though/
