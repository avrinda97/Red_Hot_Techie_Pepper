2010-01-09T07:25:00.000Z	thasp		every half an hour i get an orange, black, or blue ascreen and everythng halts
2010-01-09T07:25:00.000Z	thasp		this machine passes 24 hrs of prime and memtest in win7
2010-01-09T07:26:00.000Z	thasp		is there someplace i can look, or some logfile that might tell me what is going on?
2010-01-09T07:27:00.000Z	acicula	thasp	/var/log/ holds logfiles
2010-01-09T07:27:00.000Z	acicula	thasp	running the binary nvidia/ati driver?
2010-01-09T07:27:00.000Z	thasp	acicula	I'm using hte abomination integrated ati video on an asus m4a78 mobo
2010-01-09T07:28:00.000Z	acicula	thasp	did you activate the ati driver
2010-01-09T07:28:00.000Z	acicula	thasp	and is it still OC'ed?
2010-01-09T07:29:00.000Z	thasp	acicula	never OC'd, i ran prime & memtest to test stability at stock before blaming ubuntu or a driver
2010-01-09T07:29:00.000Z	acicula	thasp	well the usual suspect would be the flgrx driver disable that and see if the problem occurs still?
2010-01-09T07:29:00.000Z	thasp		syslog is a jungle
2010-01-09T07:29:00.000Z	acicula		\
2010-01-09T07:30:00.000Z	thasp		i will google how to disable the flgr driver and report back
2010-01-09T07:30:00.000Z	thasp		thank you sir
2010-01-09T07:30:00.000Z	acicula	thasp	system->administration->hardware driver
2010-01-09T07:31:00.000Z	thasp	acicula	it says not activated, same for my atheros card
2010-01-09T07:31:00.000Z	thasp		however, i am using wifi
2010-01-09T07:31:00.000Z	thasp		it's an ar5005g card
2010-01-09T07:32:00.000Z	thasp		i will try activating them, couldn';t hurt
2010-01-09T07:32:00.000Z	thasp		there's a 1 second delay between hitting a key in irc and it showing up, maybe this will fix that too
2010-01-09T07:32:00.000Z	acicula	thasp	means its using the open source driver
2010-01-09T07:33:00.000Z	acicula	thasp	yeah thats not good
