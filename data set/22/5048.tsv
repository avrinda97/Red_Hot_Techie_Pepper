2008-01-27T05:21:00.000Z	unop	RequinB4	firstly, fsck-ing a disk is not something to take lightly, secondly, why do you want to fsck a disk:
2008-01-27T05:22:00.000Z	unop	RequinB4	fsck is not the tool for the job -- you need something like smarttools to check the disk for errors
2008-01-27T05:22:00.000Z	RequinB4	unop	bkar - All i have write now is a root shell and no internet access
2008-01-27T05:23:00.000Z	RequinB4	unop	bkar - i was going to alt install so i can fix a "moniter out of range" error i have trying to boot any kind of x
2008-01-27T05:23:00.000Z	unop	RequinB4	what OS/Distro are you running to have the root shell up?
2008-01-27T05:25:00.000Z	RequinB4	unop	bkar - 'cd dev' then 'ls' gives me ... hda hda1 hda2 hdc hdd ...
2008-01-27T05:27:00.000Z	unop	RequinB4	in the shell - does  this command bring up anything -- man testdisk ?
2008-01-27T05:28:00.000Z	RequinB4	unop	- manual is there
2008-01-27T05:28:00.000Z	unop	RequinB4	ok, if you encounter problems with partitioning the disk -- you can use testdisk to check the disk
2008-01-27T05:29:00.000Z	RequinB4	unop	so just 'testdisk' in a shell
2008-01-27T05:29:00.000Z	RequinB4	unop	- how would i get out of the manual
2008-01-27T05:29:00.000Z	unop	RequinB4	press q  or ctrl+x
2008-01-27T05:29:00.000Z	unop	RequinB4	press q  or ctrl+c * sorry
2008-01-27T05:31:00.000Z	RequinB4	unop	- "teskdisk: error while loading shared libraries: libntfs.so.9: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2008-01-27T05:32:00.000Z	unop	RequinB4	it looks like a partition is ntfs and testdisk doesnt fully have support for ntfs built in
2008-01-27T05:35:00.000Z	unop	RequinB4	force mount -- mount -t ntfs /dev/hdXX /mountpoint -o force
2008-01-27T05:42:00.000Z	unop	RequinB4	you can just delete the partition to the same effect
2008-01-27T05:43:00.000Z	unop	RequinB4	unless you want to backup files on that partition
2008-01-27T05:43:00.000Z	RequinB4	unop	- wipe it all for all i care
2008-01-30T04:44:00.000Z	unop	RequinB4	have you tried openoffice calc?
2008-01-30T04:45:00.000Z	RequinB4	unop	doesn't work
2008-08-02T02:21:00.000Z	unop	RequinB4	that's speculative and also biased - also offtopic
