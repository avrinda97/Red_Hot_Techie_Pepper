2005-10-20T16:26:00.000Z	penguin42		interesting - my apt-get dist-upgrade over night didn't download everything, it started installing things, I answered a few of its questions but I've had to do another apt-get install dist-upgrade and its fetching another 280MB
2005-10-20T11:30:00.000Z	penguin42		hi - I seem to be having a conflict during a breezy upgrade (I've looked at the wicky page) - can someone with a fresh breezy install tell me if they have openoffice.org2-help-en-us and/or openoffice.org2-calc and if so what versions please
2005-10-20T11:32:00.000Z	penguin42		or could a breezy user please do a dpkg -s ubuntu-desktop      and tell me what they have for version?
2005-10-20T11:33:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif	penguin42	- 0.80 ubuntu-desktop; 1.9.129 OO.o -Calc
2005-10-20T11:34:00.000Z	penguin42	BreezyInCalif	Thanks - I seem to have a nasty set of broken dependencies somewhere
2005-10-20T11:42:00.000Z	penguin42	BreezyInCalif	Do you have both openoffice.org2-calc and openoffice.org2-help-en-us installed?  That is my current sticking point - they both seem to have a
2005-10-20T11:44:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif	penguin42	- not sure if I have oo.o2-help-en-us or not
2005-10-20T11:44:00.000Z	penguin42	BreezyInCalif	Can you dpkg -s it please?
2005-10-20T11:45:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif	penguin42	... sure - but which "it" do you want me to dpkg -s ?
2005-10-20T11:45:00.000Z	penguin42	BreezyInCalif	openoffice.org2-help-en-us
2005-10-20T11:46:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif	penguin42	... sorry, not installed
2005-10-20T11:46:00.000Z	penguin42	BreezyInCalif	No, that is good! It tells me it is probably what I need to remove!
2005-10-20T11:57:00.000Z	penguin42	BreezyInCalif	In the end I used dpkg -r to remove all openoffice.org packages from my system - that seems to have freed up the dist-upgrade
2005-10-20T11:58:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif	penguin42	- I did something similar; somewhere along the line from Warty-Hoary-Breezy I had upgraded OO.o manually and it left me with "issues" on the dist-upgrade
2005-10-20T11:59:00.000Z	penguin42	BreezyInCalif	Nod - I'm surprised it has been such a fight actually
2005-10-20T12:00:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif	penguin42	- yeppers - it cost me a little sweat, but no tears - and best part of a weekend - but I *think* that if I remember, next time around, I'll apt-get update, apt-get --install ubuntu-base and ubuntu-desktop, and *then* apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-10-20T12:01:00.000Z	penguin42	BreezyInCalif	Nod - what is the ubuntu-base and ubuntu-desktop about that they need doing seperately ?
2005-10-20T12:02:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif	penguin42	- my understanding of that is poor at best, but I think that they lay down an "expected" set of programs (stuff that "everyone" will want) that the upgrade will later rely on existing
2005-10-20T12:02:00.000Z	penguin42	BreezyInCalif	Nod
2005-10-20T12:03:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif	penguin42	- typo? or considered opinion? (lol)
2005-10-20T12:04:00.000Z	penguin42	BreezyInCalif	Haha - oops, well it was a typo - but my experience with it has never been good
2005-10-20T12:05:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif	penguin42	and Ron_o: I had wine working in Hoary, but upgrade to Breezy blew out bits and pieces of what I had. I haven't tried troubleshooting it yet.
