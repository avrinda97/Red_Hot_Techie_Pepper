2007-05-18T16:51:00.000Z	chamunks		Hey does anyone know how to activate sound for games n such for wine?
2007-05-18T16:53:00.000Z	chamunks		anyone know anything about sound support in wine?
2007-05-18T16:53:00.000Z	Quintin	chamunks	/join #wine.  sound works fine for me... probably want to do $ winecfg and set sound to 22050 , OSS, emulation
2007-05-18T16:54:00.000Z	chamunks	Quintin	thanks
2007-05-18T05:01:00.000Z	chamunks	Quintin	noone rly in wine
2007-05-18T05:01:00.000Z	chamunks	Quintin	noone rly in #wine
2007-05-18T05:02:00.000Z	Quintin	chamunks	what is the issue?
2007-05-18T05:02:00.000Z	Quintin	chamunks	oh, it's #winehq, not #wine.
2007-05-18T05:03:00.000Z	chamunks	Quintin	well i get no sound in games at all or in winamp or any sound software for that matter
2007-05-18T05:03:00.000Z	Quintin	chamunks	did you run winecfg?
2007-05-18T05:04:00.000Z	chamunks	Quintin	i ran it and did what you said was your config earlier
2007-05-18T05:04:00.000Z	Quintin	chamunks	... scroll up.
2007-05-18T05:05:00.000Z	chamunks	Quintin	yeah im in winehq just figured you might know
2007-05-18T05:06:00.000Z	Quintin	chamunks	I already told you .. doesn't your client have search ?  OSS, 22050 sampling, "emulation"
2007-06-05T14:16:00.000Z	Quintin	chamunks	For what purpose?  desktop user or ssh?
2007-06-05T14:17:00.000Z	chamunks	Quintin	ssh in particular but learning the way to do it both ways would be exellent
2007-06-05T14:18:00.000Z	Quintin	chamunks	There shouldn't be much of a need for this, really. If you want somethign where user can only upload files, but not use ssh, there is scponly shell
2007-06-05T14:19:00.000Z	chamunks	Quintin	i jsut have a friend of mind who needs ssh access to my system from time to time and he can be a bit of a trickster
2007-06-05T14:19:00.000Z	Quintin	chamunks	then don't give him access.
2007-06-05T14:20:00.000Z	chamunks	Quintin	well hes not malicious or anything its just he can tend to do annoying things n it would be kewl to learn how to restrict access
2007-06-05T14:21:00.000Z	Quintin	chamunks	what you ask is non-trivial.
2007-06-05T14:23:00.000Z	chamunks	Quintin	blast well i hoped it would be simple
