2006-10-05T11:52:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		hello its me again
2006-10-05T11:53:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		whats the best filesystem for a linux root partition and for a swap partition?
2006-10-05T11:53:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		i dont have only fat32 and ntfs... i got a whole load of filesystems =(
2006-10-05T11:53:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	for / i would use ext3 and swap has "swap"
2006-10-05T11:55:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	yup
2006-10-05T11:57:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	you mount a partition to a place in the system so you can use it.. (in windows that mount point would be like "C:")
2006-10-05T11:58:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	that means you can acces those partitions from those directories (and they will be mounted automaticly on boot)
2006-10-05T11:59:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	ntfs filesystems are normally mounted as read only, so you cant write to there from linux
2006-10-05T12:00:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	well, go blame ms for that!
2006-10-05T12:00:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	they dont show open source developers howto use that filesystem, so they have very hardtime to support that filesystem.
2006-10-05T12:01:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	fat32 has very good support under linux
2006-10-05T12:03:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	you should ALLWAYS have external backups... yes, windows can broke things too... so, dont trust computers ;)
2006-10-05T12:07:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	i think it depends on from what to what... and then ask google
2006-10-05T12:08:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	np, thats why we are here :)
2006-10-05T12:08:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	dualboot is allways hard, if you dont know about partitions and file systems (on what ever os)
2006-10-05T12:19:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	ubuntu dapper or edgy ?
2006-10-05T12:28:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	applications - accessories - terminal
2006-10-05T12:29:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	and yes, it quite hidden there, i would drag it to the panel ;)
2006-10-05T12:35:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	"optain automaticly" could mean "dhcp" ...
2006-10-05T13:25:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	can you uninstall a running windows with itself ?
2006-10-05T13:25:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	you got ideas... :/
2006-10-05T13:26:00.000Z	oskude	SoH|Tony	regonize network cable ?
