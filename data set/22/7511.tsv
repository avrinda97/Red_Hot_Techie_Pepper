2008-01-01T23:23:00.000Z	emma		it's not working. When I click on the firefox icon it tells me that i cannot start firefox because it's not responding and already running, i must either restart or else terminate the firefox process
2008-01-01T23:24:00.000Z	emma		any ideas how i can make firefox work again?
2008-01-01T23:25:00.000Z	emma		without restarting?
2008-01-01T23:26:00.000Z	emma		I keep getting this message: Firefox is already running but is not responding. To open a new window you must terminate the existing process or restart your system.
2008-01-01T23:26:00.000Z	emma		Any ideas? Once this happened and someone in here knew what to type.
2008-01-01T23:26:00.000Z	emma		great idea!
2008-01-01T23:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	emma	the fastest way to fix that without the terminal is CTRL+Alt+backspace
2008-04-07T04:10:00.000Z	emma	Scunizi	could you connect it to the internet and download the install directly to it?
2008-04-07T04:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	emma	I just stuck an old nic card into it.. but how would I download directly to it for install? I'm missing something.
2008-04-07T04:12:00.000Z	emma	Scunizi	I thought if you could download the whole cd to the hard drive, then you could use that.
2008-04-07T04:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	emma	no that won't work.. there would be no way to boot to the installer..
2008-04-07T04:14:00.000Z	emma	Scunizi	- could you put it on many many floppies?
2008-04-07T04:15:00.000Z	emma	Scunizi	I would like to know how you are supposed to install Ubuntu on this machine. Let me know when you find out.
2008-04-07T04:16:00.000Z	emma	Scunizi	this one --- http://www.instantfundas.com/2007/08/install-any-linux-distro-directly-from.html
2008-04-07T04:17:00.000Z	Scunizi	emma	I'm reading this link .. sounds interesting.  http://tinyurl.com/3exghs
2008-05-27T05:32:00.000Z	emma	Scunizi	But someone won't likely have a separate home partition unless they set that up on a previous install.
2008-05-27T05:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	emma	true.. but you can make one and copy you stuff over before upgrading..
2009-02-04T02:41:00.000Z	emma	Scunizi	You stop.
2009-02-04T02:41:00.000Z	emma	Scunizi	Stop highlighting me in this channel when I did not even know you were in this channel.
2009-02-04T02:42:00.000Z	emma	Scunizi	Highlighting me in a channel that I did not even know you are in is rude. Please don't speak to me.
2009-02-04T02:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	emma	funny you should say that since you've been pm-ing me for that last 3 minutes..
2009-02-04T02:43:00.000Z	emma	Scunizi	What does that have to do with the veracity of my comment?
