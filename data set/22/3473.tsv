2008-09-16T23:29:00.000Z	blue112		Please, is there a simple way to jail a ssh user into a directory ?
2008-09-16T23:29:00.000Z	benjick	blue112	rbash or ibsh
2008-09-16T23:30:00.000Z	blue112	benjick	that applications are simple to configure ?
2008-09-16T23:30:00.000Z	benjick	blue112	Yeah, i think so
2008-09-16T23:31:00.000Z	blue112	benjick	Ok, thanks, i read & try.
2008-09-16T23:31:00.000Z	benjick	blue112	yw
2008-09-16T23:36:00.000Z	blue112	benjick	rbash seems to be complex for what I want to do. I just want to jail an ssh user, but I want it to be completly free otherwise.
2008-09-16T23:39:00.000Z	benjick	blue112	Then ibsh i think
2008-09-16T23:39:00.000Z	blue112	benjick	Ok. I'll try.
2008-09-16T23:40:00.000Z	blue112	benjick	Do you know a good tutorial for using it ?
2008-09-16T23:42:00.000Z	benjick	blue112	No, sorry
2008-09-17T00:02:00.000Z	blue112	benjick	I put a call to ibsh into .bashrc, but .bashrc isn't called when user connects by ssh...
2008-09-17T00:03:00.000Z	benjick	blue112	Pick ibsh as the shell
2008-09-17T00:03:00.000Z	blue112	benjick	i'll try.
2008-09-17T00:03:00.000Z	blue112	benjick	Great ! Thanks.
2008-09-17T00:03:00.000Z	benjick	blue112	np :) don't forget to allow logout, exit etc
2008-09-17T00:04:00.000Z	blue112	benjick	Ok.
2008-09-17T00:06:00.000Z	blue112	benjick	When I set user's shell to ibsh, he can't connect by ftp anymore >_<
2008-09-17T00:06:00.000Z	blue112	benjick	It says "Response: 530 Login incorrect."
2008-09-17T00:07:00.000Z	benjick	blue112	ftp should work
2008-09-17T00:07:00.000Z	blue112	benjick	with /bin/bash as user's shell, it works. But it doesn't with /bin/ibsh
