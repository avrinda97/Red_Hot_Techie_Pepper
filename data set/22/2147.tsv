2011-03-22T17:36:00.000Z	Frots	rebecca	did it work?
2011-03-22T17:38:00.000Z	rebecca	Frots	well, no. seemed to get a little further this time though. the loading screen was visible this time.. and the login dialog box strobed on the screen a few times briefly.. but now it's some how worse, i don't even see a cursor on the screen hehe
2011-03-22T17:38:00.000Z	Frots	rebecca	and what does the log outputs?
2011-03-22T17:40:00.000Z	Frots	rebecca	please read terry's message, If you installed evdev correctly you can delete /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2011-03-22T17:44:00.000Z	rebecca	Frots	http://paste.ubuntu.com/583791/
2011-03-22T17:45:00.000Z	Frots	rebecca	that looks OK
2011-03-22T17:47:00.000Z	rebecca	Frots	hmmm, there is not xorg.conf in /etc/X11/
2011-03-22T17:47:00.000Z	rebecca	Frots	but i do notice a /home/rebecca/xorg.conf.new
2011-03-22T17:49:00.000Z	rebecca	Frots	well, i dont' see anything on the screen at all now. it's not just blank it's essentially off
2011-03-22T17:49:00.000Z	Frots	rebecca	and what driver did you install for the VGA (output) ?
2011-03-22T17:50:00.000Z	rebecca	Frots	it's just using whatever is default. i havn't manually specified anything
2011-03-22T17:53:00.000Z	rebecca	Frots	/ terry : i _have_ to boot into recovery mode just to fix this?
2011-03-22T17:53:00.000Z	Frots	rebecca	you can also just boot to runlevel 3 instead of 5
2011-03-22T17:54:00.000Z	rebecca	Frots	will that retain networking? the only way i can currently communicate with this box is via SSH
2011-03-22T17:54:00.000Z	Frots	rebecca	yes that will still start the networking
2011-03-22T17:55:00.000Z	rebecca	Frots	im also talking to you on the box in question btw
2011-03-22T17:59:00.000Z	rebecca	Frots	change the run level using telinit?
2011-03-22T18:00:00.000Z	Frots	rebecca	no just boot and add txt to your bootline
2011-03-22T18:01:00.000Z	rebecca	Frots	oh, what abot my options if i don't have local access to the machine?
2011-03-22T18:01:00.000Z	Frots	rebecca	if you dont have local access, you can edit the grub configuration so it reboots into recovery
2011-03-22T18:16:00.000Z	Frots	rebecca	I still thinjk its a driver issue
2011-03-22T18:17:00.000Z	Frots	rebecca	yes, you can set it to vesa
