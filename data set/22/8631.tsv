2005-06-24T11:40:00.000Z	mencial		Good evening to all. I have a big problem: I cannot get the Ubuntu installer to install from a ISO file in a partition. I have installed it from CD-ROM, but this machine has no CD-ROM and I do not have the resources for a network install.
2005-06-24T11:42:00.000Z	concept10	mencial	Im not sure if you can install from a mounted .iso
2005-06-24T11:43:00.000Z	concept10	mencial	thats interesting
2005-06-24T11:45:00.000Z	concept10	mencial	post that link again. it was dead
2005-06-24T11:48:00.000Z	concept10	mencial	you should note that the link you posted only explains installer components - it doesnt say that you may install from a .iso
2005-06-24T11:49:00.000Z	concept10	mencial	you dont have a CD Rom available?
2005-06-24T11:50:00.000Z	mencial	concept10	It tells about a component that looks for ISO in the HD in case there is no CD.
2005-06-24T11:51:00.000Z	mencial	concept10	No. It is a mini-itx system, it won't have a CD, and the rest of my computers are laptops. I have 1GB USB keychains available; could I boot from there?
2005-06-24T11:51:00.000Z	concept10	mencial	it says  "Looks for ISO file systems, which may be on a CD-ROM or on the hard drive."
2005-06-24T11:52:00.000Z	concept10	mencial	you can install from USB if your bios supports that
2005-06-24T11:53:00.000Z	mencial	concept10	It does. Should I just put the .ISO file in the USB HD, or do I have to format something?
2005-06-24T11:54:00.000Z	concept10	mencial	im not sure.  I havent done a usb install - lookup installation instuctions for that
2005-06-24T11:55:00.000Z	mencial	concept10	The thing is, I can get the install kernel to boot, but it complains that it does not find a CD-ROM and does not let me go forward (even in priority=low)
2005-06-24T11:56:00.000Z	mencial	concept10	Is there another install-kernel? Or a better place to ask?
2005-06-24T11:57:00.000Z	concept10	mencial	hold on im looking for you
2005-06-24T11:58:00.000Z	mencial	concept10	Thanks. I'm trying USB now...
2005-06-24T12:03:00.000Z	concept10	mencial	The release notes state that you may install from USB but I couldnt find the docs to do it.  I guess you would have to place the proper .iso on your USB drive and boot from there
2005-06-24T12:05:00.000Z	mencial	concept10	"Place the iso" means: A) cp ubuntu.iso /media/usb B) dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sda ?
2005-06-24T12:05:00.000Z	mencial	concept10	Sorry if I ask too much. I am trying the first and will try the second if it does not work.
2005-06-24T12:06:00.000Z	mencial	concept10	Thanks for the help
2005-06-24T12:06:00.000Z	concept10	mencial	im not sure.  try to copy the .iso to the usb drive with nautilus
2005-06-24T12:07:00.000Z	mencial	concept10	That's what I am doing first
