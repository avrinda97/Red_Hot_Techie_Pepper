2009-01-20T22:49:00.000Z	nuaimat	bazhang	http://paste.ubuntu.com/107396/
2009-01-20T22:50:00.000Z	bazhang	nuaimat	you are getting an error with the google repo?
2009-01-20T22:51:00.000Z	nuaimat	bazhang	no, http://paste.ubuntu.com/107393/
2009-01-20T22:52:00.000Z	nuaimat	bazhang	any idea whats wrong ?
2009-01-20T22:52:00.000Z	bazhang	nuaimat	did you try to comment out the intrepid-updates repo? ie put a # in front of them, update and try again
2009-01-20T22:53:00.000Z	nuaimat	bazhang	ok , i will try it now, but i will loose some updates !
2009-01-20T22:53:00.000Z	bazhang	nuaimat	better yet
2009-01-20T22:53:00.000Z	bazhang	nuaimat	go to software sources and change to a different server
2009-01-20T22:54:00.000Z	nuaimat	bazhang	i have tried that before , with no success too
2009-01-20T22:54:00.000Z	bazhang	nuaimat	that is odd; what are you trying to do when this occurs
2009-01-20T22:54:00.000Z	nuaimat	bazhang	i think my ISP is using a caching server, that the checksum is outdated or the file is outdated
2009-01-20T22:55:00.000Z	nuaimat	bazhang	how can i force apt not to use cached versions on my ISP cache server ?
2009-01-20T22:56:00.000Z	bazhang	nuaimat	not sure about that one; never had experience with that
2009-11-07T20:16:00.000Z	bazhang	nuaimat	it will work certainly
2009-11-07T20:16:00.000Z	nuaimat	bazhang	have u tried it ? recommend ?
2009-11-07T20:17:00.000Z	bazhang	nuaimat	on that size screen? not really no
2009-11-07T20:17:00.000Z	nuaimat	bazhang	no, i mean have you tried it at all , regardless of screen size
2009-11-07T20:17:00.000Z	bazhang	nuaimat	yes I have. on a very small netbook though
2009-11-07T20:18:00.000Z	nuaimat	bazhang	what do you think?? is it good, bad  ?? any comments ?
