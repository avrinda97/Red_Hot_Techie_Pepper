2006-01-20T06:59:00.000Z	chuck		Ok, I have ubuntu on slave drive with communication online, then installed suse 10.0, it wouldn't communicate, ubuntu live will not work online, a second ubuntu install will not work, why only one install will communicate online
2006-01-20T07:00:00.000Z	chuck		And I have caBLE MODEM
2006-01-20T07:01:00.000Z	soundray	chuck	how is your modem attached to the computer?
2006-01-20T07:03:00.000Z	chuck	soundray	USB
2006-01-20T07:03:00.000Z	soundray	chuck	it's fairly typical that some distributions will autodetect a piece of hardware while others won't.
2006-01-20T07:04:00.000Z	soundray	chuck	if it doesn't work in Ubuntu, you'll have to find the drivers and configure them and pppoe yourself.
2006-01-20T07:04:00.000Z	chuck	soundray	both ubuntu installs are off the same CD
2006-01-20T07:05:00.000Z	soundray	chuck	oh, and one works, the other doesn't?
2006-01-20T07:05:00.000Z	chuck	soundray	that is correct
2006-01-20T07:06:00.000Z	chuck	soundray	and both were set at always online
2006-01-20T07:07:00.000Z	soundray	chuck	can you find out in the install that works, what modules it loads for the modem. Then you can check for errors relating to loading that module in the other installation.
2006-01-20T07:08:00.000Z	chuck	soundray	I am questioning linux on HP, but i will need to find the driver files
2006-01-20T07:09:00.000Z	soundray	chuck	really your best option would be to fix your ethernet.
2006-01-20T07:11:00.000Z	chuck	soundray	if that will even work, why only the first install works getsme, I appreciate your help!
2006-01-20T07:11:00.000Z	soundray	chuck	it's hard to tell unless you can pinpoint the specific point of failure and report an error message.
2006-01-20T07:13:00.000Z	chuck	soundray	I'll let you know what i figure out
2006-01-20T07:13:00.000Z	soundray	chuck	I'll have to leave now, but there are always helpful people around as you know.
2006-01-20T07:14:00.000Z	chuck	soundray	thanks
2008-02-04T04:03:00.000Z	soundray	chuck	does it list boot choices when you hit Tab at the yaboot prompt?
2008-02-04T04:03:00.000Z	chuck	soundray	yes
2008-02-04T04:04:00.000Z	chuck	soundray	i've tried live, live video=ofonly, and live-nosplash-powerpc
2008-02-04T04:05:00.000Z	soundray	chuck	perhaps try "live vga=771" (generic video mode, not sure if it'll work on ppc)
