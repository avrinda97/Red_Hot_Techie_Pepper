2008-01-14T13:38:00.000Z	timandtom		Are there any good Wine alternatives?
2008-01-14T13:39:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	You could try Cedega or Crossover :)
2008-01-14T13:40:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	Cedega probably would be your best bet
2008-01-14T13:42:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	Cedega is actually commercial software, but there is a trial available, you might need to download it from the official site

2008-01-14T13:59:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	cd ~/Desktop/torrents
2008-01-14T14:05:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	put ./ instead of just / :)
2008-01-14T14:06:00.000Z	timandtom	HashBox	Ah, thanks :) One of these days I'll get one of these right on my own, one of these days...
2008-01-14T14:06:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	it takes time, but you'll get there :)
2008-01-14T14:07:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	umm, im not sure, are you sure the filename is correct?
2008-01-14T14:09:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	ah that explains it :)
2008-01-14T14:12:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	good luck :)
2008-01-14T14:18:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	in a terminal try "glxinfo | grep dri" I think, im sure that card is supported, is there a way to force Cedega to run without that test?
2008-01-14T14:20:00.000Z	timandtom	HashBox	I could fail every test and it would still run, just probably not very well. But, as the games almost all 3d, i'd like to have 3d working, haha. That was the only thing that didnt work well in Wine, is 3d things, so, hopefully if i get my graphics card working, i wont even need cedega
2008-01-14T14:21:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	I just thought maybe Cedega was being dumb, someone else will need to help with getting acceleration working, im not terribly knowledgable in that area lol
2008-01-14T14:25:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	you should get a line saying Direct Rending: Yes or something similar, I dont have access to a graphical machine at this minute sorry
2008-01-14T14:26:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	sorry, its "glxinfo | grep render", you should see "direct rendering: " and then it will have yes or no
2008-01-14T14:27:00.000Z	timandtom	HashBox	It says yes
2008-01-14T14:28:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	then 3D should be working fine :) thats why I was wondering if the Cedega 3D test could be skipped. if you're getting low framerates then maybe something else is up though, im not sure
2008-01-14T14:29:00.000Z	timandtom	HashBox	Ok, dang. I was hoping there would be some driver problem or something :) Drivers can be installed, but I can't fix programs, haha.
2008-01-14T14:30:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	maybe someone else might be able to help you there lol
2008-01-14T14:31:00.000Z	HashBox	timandtom	no problem :)
