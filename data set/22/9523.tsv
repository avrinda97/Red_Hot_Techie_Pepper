2005-06-15T15:58:00.000Z	subterrific		no
2005-06-15T15:58:00.000Z	subterrific		it is because the vlc.desktop file says the command is wxvlc
2005-06-15T15:58:00.000Z	subterrific		but the command is really just vlc
2005-06-15T15:59:00.000Z	subterrific		soooo, when you get that open with dialog, just do Use custom command: vlc
2005-06-15T15:59:00.000Z	subterrific		instead of picking 'VLC for Gtk+' from the list
2005-06-15T11:13:00.000Z	subterrific		there is a core GNOME developer talking about how hard it is to get GNOME on OS X working
2005-06-15T11:15:00.000Z	sri	subterrific	sure, some people like to see if they can port some of their favourite gnome apps to run on osx.
2005-06-15T11:15:00.000Z	subterrific	WhiteRabbit	odd ball page? do you have any clue what ximian is?
2005-06-15T11:16:00.000Z	sri		people who work on gnome in redhat are poart of the red hat desktop team..it's illogical that they would use OSX as their primary desktop at work.
2005-06-15T11:16:00.000Z	subterrific	WhiteRabbit	yeah, ximian and redhat employ the main developers
2005-06-15T11:17:00.000Z	subterrific	WhiteRabbit	wrong
2005-06-15T11:18:00.000Z	subterrific	WhiteRabbit	ximian was started by miguel de icaza, who started gnome
2005-06-15T11:20:00.000Z	subterrific	WhiteRabbit	so that proves that most gnome devs run redhat?
2005-06-15T11:21:00.000Z	subterrific	WhiteRabbit	no, it proves that redhat provides hosting. nothing more
2005-06-15T11:22:00.000Z	subterrific	WhiteRabbit	i can't find anything about a single GNOME dev using OS X, so prove it to me
2005-06-15T11:29:00.000Z	subterrific	WhiteRabbit	i'm in #fedora waiting
2005-06-15T11:35:00.000Z	subterrific	WhiteRabbit	you said most of them use it to develop gnome, that isn't what mether said. he said some use it some of the time.
2005-06-15T11:35:00.000Z	subterrific	WhiteRabbit	thus disproving what you said
2005-06-15T11:35:00.000Z	subterrific	WhiteRabbit	sure they use it, but not most of them, and not to develop gnome
2005-06-15T11:35:00.000Z	sri	subterrific	they use it because of the usability testing apple does on OSX
2005-06-15T11:36:00.000Z	subterrific	WhiteRabbit	some gnome devs use solaris. doesn't mean "most use it to develop gnome"
2005-06-15T11:36:00.000Z	sri	subterrific	after all GNOME's HIG is based on apple's.
