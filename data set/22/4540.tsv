2007-12-12T07:16:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Jack_Sparrow	 i still need a driver for it since ubuntu dosnt naturally support them?
2007-12-12T07:16:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Jack_Sparrow	 ie wvdialconf does not find it
2007-12-12T07:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Fawkesfyre	THe $ driver costs more than a real modem...
2007-12-12T07:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Fawkesfyre	do you see the modem with the first command I gave.?
2007-12-12T07:17:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Jack_Sparrow	 in time you mean?  there is a supported linmodem driver
2007-12-12T07:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Fawkesfyre	do you see the modem with the first command I gave.?  I was thinking you meant you had a winmodem.. ie softmodem not a hardware modem
2007-12-12T07:18:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Jack_Sparrow	 i get ttys0 at 1/0 (hex) irq=4 is a 16550a
2007-12-12T07:18:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Jack_Sparrow	 its not quite a soft modem
2007-12-12T07:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Fawkesfyre	Is this an external on a buffered serial port
2007-12-12T07:19:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Jack_Sparrow	 no, its an internal 56k AgereDSP
2007-12-12T07:19:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Jack_Sparrow	 the martian modem driver set coveres it, with teh most recent being martian-full-20071101
2007-12-12T07:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Fawkesfyre	That looks more like an open external serial and not a modem..
2007-12-12T07:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Fawkesfyre	Test in terminal with sudo screen /dev/ttyS0
2007-12-12T07:21:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Jack_Sparrow	well scanModem detects it, and the device shows up in the device manager
2007-12-12T07:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Fawkesfyre	You should now be in a Modem terminal window so type "ATZ" then return It should respond with OK
2007-12-12T07:22:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Jack_Sparrow	nothing
2007-12-12T07:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Fawkesfyre	So it isnt showing up as a regular modem...
2007-12-12T07:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Fawkesfyre	Use ctrl-A then K to kill the modem terminal
