2008-12-06T23:38:00.000Z	keithclark		What would be the device name of a serial to usb convertor?
2008-12-06T23:38:00.000Z	keithclark		ttySx, where x is the port number?
2008-12-06T23:39:00.000Z	jtaji	keithclark	usually /dev/ttyUSBx
2008-12-06T23:39:00.000Z	keithclark	jtaji	Yeah, I sort of thought so, but it says I have no access to that.
2008-12-06T23:40:00.000Z	jtaji	keithclark	run dmesg after you plug it in will tell for sure
2008-12-06T23:41:00.000Z	keithclark	jtaji	it comes up ttyUSB0.  Do I have to change permissions on the file or something?
2008-12-06T23:42:00.000Z	jtaji	keithclark	perhaps, check the permissions/ownership with 'ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0'
2008-12-06T23:43:00.000Z	keithclark	jtaji	crw-rw----
2008-12-06T23:44:00.000Z	jtaji	keithclark	and the user and group after that?
2008-12-06T23:44:00.000Z	keithclark	jtaji	crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 188, 0 2008-12-06 12:31 ttyUSB0
2008-12-06T23:45:00.000Z	jtaji	keithclark	I'd add your user to the dialout group
2008-12-06T23:45:00.000Z	jtaji	keithclark	sudo usermod -a -G dialout
2008-12-06T23:45:00.000Z	jtaji	keithclark	err... sudo usermod -a -G dialout yourusername
2008-12-06T23:46:00.000Z	keithclark	jtaji	ok, but ttyS3 has these permissions and I don't get an error trying to use it: crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 67 2008-12-06 13:26 ttyS3
2008-12-06T23:48:00.000Z	jtaji	keithclark	you can see what groups you are currently a member of with the groups command, if you are already in dialout then I'm not sure
2008-12-06T23:49:00.000Z	keithclark	jtaji	shoot.....not sure then.
2008-12-06T23:50:00.000Z	jtaji	keithclark	as you can see ttyUSB0 has the same permissions as ttyS3, it should work
2008-12-06T23:50:00.000Z	keithclark	jtaji	yup, but no go in the printers settings dialog
2008-12-06T23:53:00.000Z	jtaji	keithclark	you're trying to set up a serial printer?
2008-12-06T23:53:00.000Z	keithclark	jtaji	yes
2008-12-06T23:58:00.000Z	jtaji	keithclark	hmm, so I wonder if it needs to be accessible by some other non-root user.... you could just set chmod o+rw on it now to test.. and depending on your security needs, keep it that way
2008-12-07T00:03:00.000Z	keithclark	jtaji	nope, no luck and now I can't even get the printers dialog to allow me to change the device settings.
