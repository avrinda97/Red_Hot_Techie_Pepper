2008-04-27T17:47:00.000Z	filthpig		hi, does anyone know when the wine 0.9.60 package is available through the package manager? And also, how I can install wine's own ubuntu-.deb without causing problems later on?
2008-04-27T17:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filthpig	easiest thing to do is just add the wine repository
2008-04-27T17:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filthpig	then you can just use synaptic to install it
2008-04-27T17:49:00.000Z	filthpig	IndyGunFreak	yeah, but when the repos don't update fast enough, I'd like to do it myself...
2008-04-27T17:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filthpig	if you add the wine repository, it should update when wine updates their repository
2008-04-27T17:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filthpig	i just double checked, i'm using 0.9.6
2008-04-27T17:53:00.000Z	filthpig	IndyGunFreak	hmm, then why haven't I got it yet? o_O
2008-04-27T17:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filthpig	how did you install it?
2008-04-27T17:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filthpig	FROM THE WINE REPO or from the ubuntu repo, pay atttention
2008-04-27T17:54:00.000Z	filthpig	IndyGunFreak	I have the wine one added to my repo list, at least
2008-04-27T17:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filthpig	i don't know.. cuz i'm on the current one, and i didn't do anything.. and its the one i have
2008-04-27T17:55:00.000Z	filthpig	IndyGunFreak	have you upgraded to hardy?
2008-04-27T17:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filthpig	didn't upgrade, i clean installed, but i've used wine for a while, and i've always gotten regular updates via the wine repo
2008-04-27T17:56:00.000Z	filthpig	IndyGunFreak	yeah, but when I checked the wine page they only mention the hardy repo, nada about gutsy
2008-04-27T17:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filthpig	well, i don't know about that, but i did notice that.. maybe they arent supporting old repos anymore.. don't know.. but i noticed that also.
2008-04-27T17:58:00.000Z	filthpig	IndyGunFreak	checking on the #winehq now
2008-04-27T18:03:00.000Z	filthpig	IndyGunFreak	hmm, my wine pck is held back from upgrading oO
2008-05-05T06:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filthpig	only prob would be that windows won't see it anymore.
2008-05-05T06:05:00.000Z	filthpig	IndyGunFreak	who cares about windows? /me is ubuntu only ;)
2008-05-05T06:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filthpig	then format away, shouldn't be an issue.. all mine are ext3
2008-05-05T06:06:00.000Z	filthpig	IndyGunFreak	good stuff! /me starts formatting and jumps to bed
2008-05-05T06:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filthpig	have fun
