2007-09-06T06:12:00.000Z	FFForever	usser	you can't decrypt css without breaking the law in the us?
2007-09-06T06:14:00.000Z	usser	FFForever	u can only if the program with which u decrypt is closed otherwise whole protection scheme goes down the drain, since u can easily modify the pgm to not only decrypt for viewing but rip the copy-protected dvds
