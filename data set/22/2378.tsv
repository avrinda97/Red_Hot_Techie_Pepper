2009-12-23T19:37:00.000Z	sarthorks		﻿sound is not working on my system (jaunty). it used to work, and still does on windows vista, to which i dual boot. here are the outputs of alsamixer and pavucontrol (both of them give errors): http://paste.ubuntu.com/345356/
2009-12-23T19:38:00.000Z	maco	sarthorks	is pulseaudio running?
2009-12-23T19:38:00.000Z	maco	sarthorks	try killing it, then restarting it with "start-pulseaudio-x11" and see what happens?
2009-12-23T19:39:00.000Z	sarthorks	maco	i've tried  this: ﻿killall pulseaudio; rm -rf ~/.pulse*    then press alt+f2  and type    pulseaudio   and press enter
2009-12-23T19:39:00.000Z	sarthorks	maco	that doesnt help. shud i try what u just saud?
2009-12-23T19:39:00.000Z	maco	sarthorks	dont do it in alt+f2. you dont get the errors then
2009-12-23T19:39:00.000Z	maco	sarthorks	try pulseaudio -vvv
2009-12-23T19:39:00.000Z	maco	sarthorks	pulseaudio -vvv -D
2009-12-23T19:45:00.000Z	sarthorks	maco	: ﻿pulseaudio -vvv -D gives "command not found", but i had killed pulseaudio from the system monitor, and it reappeared!
2009-12-23T19:47:00.000Z	maco	sarthorks	it autospawns when you start a audio-using app
2009-12-23T19:48:00.000Z	sarthorks	maco	i didnt get what you meant. could you explain it to me?
2009-12-23T19:49:00.000Z	maco	sarthorks	pulseaudio respawned because it starts automatically if anything tries to use the sound ard
2009-12-23T19:49:00.000Z	sarthorks	maco	okay, but what should i do now?
2009-12-23T19:50:00.000Z	maco	sarthorks	im not sure, sorry. was trying to get a log from pulseaudio, but command not found..
2009-12-23T19:50:00.000Z	sarthorks	maco	why would that be? if pulseaudio is installed, why should it say "not found"?
2009-12-23T19:51:00.000Z	maco	sarthorks	dunno. if its running its obviously ther. did you make a typo?
2009-12-23T19:56:00.000Z	sarthorks	maco	pulseaudio -vvv -D gives command not found, but pulseaudio gives this output:http://paste.ubuntu.com/345371/
2009-12-23T19:58:00.000Z	maco	sarthorks	that one just said its not startng becuse its already running
2009-12-23T19:58:00.000Z	sarthorks	maco	so the flags are resulting in the "command not found"?
2009-12-23T19:59:00.000Z	maco	sarthorks	i guess, though thats a bit weird. i dont know whats going on, sorry.
2009-12-23T19:59:00.000Z	maco	sarthorks	maybe try waiting around in #ubuntu-audio-help if you cant get help from anyone else here
2009-12-23T20:00:00.000Z	sarthorks	maco	ok thanks a lot anyway
