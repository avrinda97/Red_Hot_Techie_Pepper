2005-12-13T07:14:00.000Z	N6REJ		I need to recursively search through a folder and change all instances of " "  to "_" how can I do this?
2005-12-13T07:16:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	N6REJ	rename 's/ /_/g' *  (replace * with something more sane if you don't want to match *everything*) will do the folder you're in; I don't think there is a good way to do it recursively.
2005-12-13T07:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	N6REJ	I tried to get that same answer; I can pastebin the whole conversation if you'd like.
2005-12-13T07:18:00.000Z	N6REJ	tonyyarusso	I bet perl could do this...  seems to me its something to do with ... for in case do

2005-12-13T07:18:00.000Z	N6REJ	tonyyarusso	ty, I'll co read it.
2005-12-13T07:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	N6REJ	You're on the right track; the stuff within the apostrophes is a perl expression.
2005-12-13T07:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	N6REJ	Sorry about the lines being to long in the paste.
2005-12-13T07:20:00.000Z	N6REJ	tonyyarusso	ok, I vaguely remember doing something like this with perl for in statements...  Thanks
2005-12-13T07:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	N6REJ	np
2005-12-17T13:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	N6REJ	I'm not sure, but you might need to separate dapper/ as the section?
2005-12-17T13:15:00.000Z	N6REJ	tonyyarusso	I got some of the firefox amd64.deb files for ubuntu from here ... http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/ubuntu/pool/main/ the problem is they need other files too.
2005-12-17T13:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	N6REJ	Did you try enabling multiverse, universe, and restricted first?
2005-12-17T13:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	N6REJ	It looks like you should just be able to add the sections (main, etc.) after the line you put earlier.
2005-12-17T13:20:00.000Z	N6REJ	tonyyarusso	yeah, thats what I thought too!
2005-12-17T13:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	N6REJ	Have you looked at http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/ubuntu/dists/dapper/?
2005-12-17T13:20:00.000Z	N6REJ	tonyyarusso	 that might help... let me try.
2005-12-17T13:22:00.000Z	N6REJ	tonyyarusso	Failed to fetch http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/ubuntu/dists/dapper/dists/main/restricted/binary-amd64/Packages.gz  404 Not Found [IP: 64.50.236.52 80] 
2005-12-17T13:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	N6REJ	Remove the /dists after /dapper, and /restricted is a separate section, not part of /main.
2005-12-17T13:26:00.000Z	N6REJ	tonyyarusso	 so they should be seperate entrys?
2005-12-17T13:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	N6REJ	Correct.
2005-12-17T13:31:00.000Z	N6REJ	tonyyarusso	no luck so far still trying.
