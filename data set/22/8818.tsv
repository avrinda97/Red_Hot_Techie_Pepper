2005-05-13T16:22:00.000Z	Drako60		anyone have any idea why xserver won't configure?
2005-05-13T16:24:00.000Z	Drako60		yes i'm having the same trouble ChrisH_
2005-05-13T16:24:00.000Z	ChrisH_	Drako60	so I'm not the only one at least :)
2005-05-13T16:25:00.000Z	ChrisH_	Drako60	you having any luck yet? I've had to resont to using 'mousekeys'
2005-05-13T05:04:00.000Z	ChrisH_	Drako60	still having problems?
2005-05-13T05:05:00.000Z	Drako60	ChrisH_	yes the system doesn't even see the mouse
2005-05-13T05:08:00.000Z	ChrisH_	Drako60	having tried 2 different working mice, I'm pretty lost too
2005-05-13T05:09:00.000Z	Drako60	ChrisH_	what does dmesg | grep -i input give you?
2005-05-13T05:10:00.000Z	ChrisH_	Drako60	dmesg throws back lots of timeout errors for my usb ports
2005-05-13T05:10:00.000Z	Drako60	ChrisH_	what about when its connected to the PS/2 port?
2005-05-13T05:11:00.000Z	ChrisH_	Drako60	I've given up on the ps/2 port for the moment, getting it working on the USB port would be a good start
2005-05-13T05:12:00.000Z	Drako60	ChrisH_	i was curious because the only thing dmesg says for input is the keyboard, doesn't even show i have a mouse and i've tried two as well
2005-05-13T05:13:00.000Z	Drako60	ChrisH_	are you running i386 or x86_64?
2005-05-13T05:13:00.000Z	ChrisH_	Drako60	x86
2005-05-13T05:14:00.000Z	Drako60	ChrisH_	nforce?
2005-05-13T05:14:00.000Z	ChrisH_	Drako60	ok dmesg output was ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse in isa0060/serio1
2005-05-13T05:14:00.000Z	Drako60	ChrisH_	well your better off then i am
2005-05-13T05:15:00.000Z	ChrisH_	Drako60	not much better really
2005-05-13T05:15:00.000Z	Drako60	ChrisH_	atleast yours shows up
2005-05-13T05:18:00.000Z	Drako60	ChrisH_	well you could try the /dev/psaux but you did that already so i'm not sure
2005-05-13T05:19:00.000Z	ChrisH_	Drako60	I tried that earlier without any luck, doubt it'll be much different now
2005-05-13T05:27:00.000Z	ChrisH_	Drako60	it's been suggested in #kubuntu that it might be a kernel problem
