2008-05-03T02:50:00.000Z	meuerro		bye
2008-05-03T02:51:00.000Z	meuerro		plus, it's long term support
2008-05-03T02:52:00.000Z	meuerro		first, do update, then do upgrade
2008-05-03T02:53:00.000Z	meuerro		shrreeki: others partitions should be untouched
2008-05-03T02:53:00.000Z	meuerro		you mean you still have to install it and you are just preparing the drive for it?
2008-05-03T02:53:00.000Z	shreeki	meuerro	so what are the the steps to do a 'clean upgrade'? go through terminal... etc. etcv...?
2008-05-03T02:54:00.000Z	meuerro	shreeki	the update/upgrade thing I said was for UnknownFear
2008-05-03T03:02:00.000Z	meuerro	shreeki	system details? (cpu/ram)
2008-05-03T03:03:00.000Z	meuerro	shreeki	anyway, if you were clever enough as to divide root and home folders in 2 different partitions
2008-05-03T03:04:00.000Z	shreeki	meuerro	if it were a windows, i would be able to, honest. but i don't know anything about ubuntu. in fact, ubuntu was installed by a friend who is unfortunately not here anymore. i will get you the cpu/ram info---one minute
2008-05-03T03:06:00.000Z	meuerro	shreeki	for unrational that it might seem, managing the install from the command line instead of the graphical one, is a lot more self explanatory
2008-05-03T03:12:00.000Z	shreeki	meuerro	memory = 3041MiB cpu = product: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU           @ 2.40GHz bus info: cpu@0 version: 6.15.7          size: 1600MHz capacity: 1600MHz width: 64 bits
2008-05-03T03:12:00.000Z	shreeki	meuerro	i think i gave you more info than necessary? :S sorry...
2008-05-03T03:13:00.000Z	meuerro	shreeki	hardware is definitely not the problem
2008-05-03T03:13:00.000Z	shreeki	meuerro	that's what i thought as well! it couldn't be. what else should i check?
2008-05-03T03:14:00.000Z	meuerro	shreeki	well, dmesg after a full reboot
2008-05-03T03:14:00.000Z	shreeki	meuerro	... dmesg? :S i'm sorry! i'm such a noob >_>;
2008-05-03T03:15:00.000Z	meuerro	shreeki	reboot, open terminal, type dmesg, hit enter, and then look for any errors in the output
2008-05-03T03:19:00.000Z	shreeki	meuerro	this seems strange? "[17562.317613] Buffer I/O error on device sdg1, logical block 1548387
2008-05-03T03:19:00.000Z	meuerro	shreeki	you take the errors
2008-05-03T03:19:00.000Z	meuerro	shreeki	you take the errors
2008-05-03T03:20:00.000Z	meuerro	shreeki	also, remember to look up the how to about processes that are run at startup
