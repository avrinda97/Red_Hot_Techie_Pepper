2009-05-02T07:18:00.000Z	coleys	Hazuki	You will most likely have to reinstall.
2009-05-02T07:19:00.000Z	Hazuki	coleys	it's giving a lot of errors...it didn't find ndiswrapper for example
2009-05-02T07:19:00.000Z	coleys	Hazuki	Lets try another way, go .. System > Administration > hardware drivers
2009-05-02T07:19:00.000Z	Hazuki	coleys	was my first attempt; it showed nothing for me
2009-05-02T07:20:00.000Z	coleys	Hazuki	Have you done... sudo apt-get update
2009-05-02T07:20:00.000Z	coleys	Hazuki	In terminal.
2009-05-02T07:20:00.000Z	Hazuki	coleys	this is BCM4312 "low power," PCI ID 14e4:4315...will try that first and then try again

2009-05-02T07:31:00.000Z	Hazuki	coleys	this isn't working...
