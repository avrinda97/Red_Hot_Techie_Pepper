2009-12-12T16:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sheldon	 perhaps state the problem? all i see in the last 40 lines. is you sayibng 'help' over and over.
2009-12-12T16:37:00.000Z	sheldon	Dr_Willis	i cannot install the drivers of the wireless card
2009-12-12T16:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sheldon	 tell the channel what you have done/tried/and what failed.
2009-12-12T16:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sheldon	 be specific.. downloaded what exactly?
2009-12-12T16:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sheldon	 i see a problem here allready...
2009-12-12T16:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sheldon	 have you checked the forums foryour exact specific wireless card? and you did check in the System-Admin-> hardware drivers  tool to see what it suggests?
2009-12-12T16:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sheldon	 ive not had to mess with the ndiswrapper stuff in years. so cant really help more then to suggest looking on the forums for people using the exact same card and seeing what they did.
2009-12-12T16:45:00.000Z	sheldon	Dr_Willis	thnx could yo tell me how do i make a partition of ntfs
2009-12-12T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sheldon	 if you want to shrink a ntfs filesystem and make a second unallocated partition. I would use windows - it has tools for that. Or gparted can also do it.
2009-12-12T16:48:00.000Z	sheldon	Dr_Willis	i do not have an ntfs and when i did one with gparted adn then tried to install windows did not recognise it as ntfs
2009-12-12T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sheldon	 windows ignores linux partitions/filesstems - if you want a placce to install windows to. then leave part of the hard drive 'unallocated' - windows can then format/use that unallocated space Normally.
2009-12-12T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sheldon	 or use gparted to just make an empty ntfs partition.
2009-12-12T16:50:00.000Z	sheldon	Dr_Willis	thnx i am going to try again then
2010-06-12T18:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sheldon	 cant 'keep' it mounted? YOu mean it mounts then vanishes?
2010-06-12T18:22:00.000Z	sheldon	Dr_Willis	Any ideas?
2010-06-12T18:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sheldon	 optical drives seem to be  getting of worse and worse quality all the time.  Im on my 3rd one on this box. and i rarly even use the thing.
2010-06-12T18:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sheldon	 give it a good air dusting, and try  a new optical drive.. (is about all i can suggest)
2010-06-12T18:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sheldon	 check the cables also. :)
2010-06-12T18:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sheldon	 had a cut wire on one once.. caused me a lot of issues
2010-06-12T18:24:00.000Z	sheldon	Dr_Willis	thats what I thought at first, but I have 2 identical drives that failed at the same time and during an upgrade.
