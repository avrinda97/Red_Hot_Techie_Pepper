2006-12-27T06:20:00.000Z	mwe	Sonic|Laptop	you are not running x windows when you try to start it?
2006-12-27T06:21:00.000Z	mwe	Sonic|Laptop	you have to. you can't run gui apps without an x server running

2006-12-27T06:22:00.000Z	mwe	Sonic|Laptop	oh. you need to export $DISPLAY then. are you also logged in a the user running the x session?

2006-12-27T06:23:00.000Z	mwe	Sonic|Laptop	and as adaptr suggests you still need to have a running x session
2006-12-27T06:23:00.000Z	mwe	Sonic|Laptop	what are you talking about
2006-12-27T06:23:00.000Z	mwe	Sonic|Laptop	are you already logged in to X window locally or what?

2006-12-27T06:24:00.000Z	mwe	Sonic|Laptop	but is there any open x session running already?
2006-12-27T06:25:00.000Z	Sonic|Laptop	mwe	yes
