2011-04-04T06:40:00.000Z	WXZ		ok, so does anyone know how to undelete that file?
2011-04-04T06:40:00.000Z	WXZ		I mean folder
2011-04-04T06:41:00.000Z	WXZ		I saved a file in the same location as a folder, how do I get that folder back?
2011-04-04T06:42:00.000Z	Diamondcite	WXZ	It should be the difference between filename VS filename\
2011-04-04T06:42:00.000Z	WXZ	Diamondcite	I don't understand you
2011-04-04T06:43:00.000Z	Diamondcite	WXZ	Unless it says something is over written it shoud be there.. how are you accessing it? Filemanager or console?
2011-04-04T06:43:00.000Z	WXZ	Diamondcite	I saved the file as /path/to/folder, and then the folder at /path/to/folder was no longer there
2011-04-04T06:43:00.000Z	WXZ	Diamondcite	it wasn't there
2011-04-04T06:44:00.000Z	WXZ	Diamondcite	instead, there was a file called "folder" at the location /path/to/
2011-04-04T06:44:00.000Z	Diamondcite	WXZ	Hold on.. let me experiment
2011-04-04T06:44:00.000Z	WXZ	Diamondcite	specifically I was downloading a torrent with opera
2011-04-04T06:45:00.000Z	Diamondcite	WXZ	And how are you trying to get to it/
2011-04-04T06:45:00.000Z	WXZ	Diamondcite	get to what?
2011-04-04T06:45:00.000Z	Diamondcite	WXZ	The said "folder"
2011-04-04T06:45:00.000Z	WXZ	Diamondcite	if you mean my folder, I'm trying to get to it through nautilus
2011-04-04T06:47:00.000Z	Diamondcite	WXZ	 And didn't opera claim it was over writting?
2011-04-04T06:47:00.000Z	WXZ	Diamondcite	no, they didn't merge. and no
2011-04-04T06:47:00.000Z	WXZ	Diamondcite	folder named "something", save in the same location as the "something" folder, now file in the same location called "something", folder gone
2011-04-04T06:51:00.000Z	WXZ	Diamondcite	any ideas?
2011-04-04T06:52:00.000Z	Diamondcite	WXZ	I'm stumped.. NON of my apps (firefox/vuze) ever pulled a stunt like that.
2011-04-04T06:52:00.000Z	WXZ	Diamondcite	try opera
2011-04-04T06:57:00.000Z	Diamondcite	WXZ	After your experience maybe not =P
