2010-01-07T09:28:00.000Z	henryhammond		 Can anyone direct me to a good tutorial on how to set up a wireless router on ubuntu?
2010-01-07T09:29:00.000Z	brummbaer	henryhammond	do you mean connect to a wireless network? or configure a wireless router. cuz second option is same as anything else: connect to the router through your browser.
2010-01-07T09:30:00.000Z	henryhammond	brummbaer	configure the network adapter, i downloaded drivers for windows and for linux, and i just cant get it to work
2010-01-07T09:30:00.000Z	brummbaer	henryhammond	do you know what type of wireless adapter it is?

2010-01-07T09:32:00.000Z	brummbaer	henryhammond	if you run ifconfig do you see the device?
2010-01-07T09:34:00.000Z	henryhammond	brummbaer	Im not sure how i would know that (noob to linux world), but there is nothing that seems to look like it
2010-01-07T09:35:00.000Z	brummbaer	henryhammond	if you type ifconfig in terminal (applications > accessories > terminal), you should see either a eth1 or wlan0, something like that...
2010-01-07T09:36:00.000Z	henryhammond	brummbaer	i see Link encap:Ethernet and before that i see eth0
2010-01-07T09:37:00.000Z	brummbaer	henryhammond	what if you try 'lspci | grep -e Linksys' ?
2010-01-07T09:38:00.000Z	brummbaer	henryhammond	online forums are saying that version three requires custom compilation and module loading, but i'm still looking for details, k?
2010-01-07T09:39:00.000Z	henryhammond	brummbaer	okay, i tried looking, and i found some that said use ndsiwrapper, some that said to download something from ralink and change it, but i could never find the data to change, ive been trying to two days
2010-01-07T09:40:00.000Z	brummbaer	henryhammond	i totally sympathize, i spent several days working on cobbling together a decent conexant driver for karmic w/o having to pay linuxant for the unlocked driver. :)
2010-01-07T09:42:00.000Z	henryhammond	brummbaer	I entered that command, and nothing showed up, but i got no erroor
2010-01-07T09:44:00.000Z	brummbaer	henryhammond	that could mean that it's not seeing it at all or not seeing it as Linksys; if you search through the output from 'lspci', is there anything that looks like it? you may also try unplugging it then plugging it back in, then checking dmesg
2010-01-07T09:46:00.000Z	henryhammond	brummbaer	My ethernet port shows up, event though its not connected to web, but my wereless doesnt seem to show up in the list of USB controllers
2010-01-07T09:46:00.000Z	brummbaer	henryhammond	dammit i'm an idiot, i'm sorry; i'm used to doing this for internal ports, can you try lsusb instead of lspci?
2010-01-07T09:48:00.000Z	henryhammond	brummbaer	I get my SanDisk memory stick, and then the device below that the ID has 1727:0077 but no title
2010-01-07T09:52:00.000Z	brummbaer	henryhammond	odd... sadly i've reached the end of the road for my evening. as a last piece of advice, since this seems to be a common problem, all the super-techs jump on this type of thing on launchpad. your specific problem is here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/446889
2010-01-07T09:52:00.000Z	brummbaer	henryhammond	good luck to you!
2010-01-07T09:53:00.000Z	henryhammond	brummbaer	thanks alot for the help, ill keep working on it
