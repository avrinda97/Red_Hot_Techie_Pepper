2009-07-30T01:45:00.000Z	tripps		ok this is getting ridiculous. did rm ~/.Xauthority; sudo touch ~/.Xauthority && sudo chown $LOGNAME  ~/.Xauthority && sudo chmod 775 ~/.Xauthority and reinitiated update. Still getting "cannot copy user's xauthorization file"
2009-07-30T01:47:00.000Z	tripps		what's the command line way to update all available update files?
2009-07-30T01:48:00.000Z	tripps		sudo apt-get update all? or something?
2009-07-30T01:50:00.000Z	coz_	tripps	 what are you trying to do?
2009-07-30T01:50:00.000Z	tripps	coz_	just trying to update my damn ubuntu box ;)
2009-07-30T01:50:00.000Z	coz_	tripps	  if you do sudo apt-get update  then   sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  that should do it
2009-07-30T01:50:00.000Z	coz_	tripps	 the dist-upgrade will not install a new version
2009-07-30T01:51:00.000Z	tripps	coz_	ok cool
2009-07-30T01:52:00.000Z	coz_	tripps	upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system
2009-07-30T01:52:00.000Z	coz_	tripps	  dist-upgrade, in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages"
2009-07-30T01:52:00.000Z	tripps	coz_	gotcha
2009-07-30T01:52:00.000Z	tripps	coz_	curious then - what is the command line to actually do a distro upgrade?
2009-07-30T01:53:00.000Z	coz_	tripps	  that would be   sudo update-manager -d
2009-07-30T01:53:00.000Z	tripps	coz_	cool. appreciate your help!
2009-07-30T01:53:00.000Z	coz_	tripps	  no problem :)
