2007-04-28T15:11:00.000Z	foug		does AMD have something similar to duo core?
2007-04-28T15:11:00.000Z	Toma-	foug	most opterons are multicore
2007-04-28T15:12:00.000Z	foug	Toma-	thanks
2007-04-28T15:12:00.000Z	Toma-	foug	also, athlon x2's are dual cored
2007-04-28T15:12:00.000Z	foug	Toma-	dumb question, but what processor would you say is best bang for buck?
2007-04-28T15:13:00.000Z	Toma-	foug	sempron 64 bits
2007-04-28T15:13:00.000Z	Toma-	foug	anything over 3200 will be nice :)
2007-04-28T15:13:00.000Z	foug	Toma-	good for gaming and everything else in between?
2007-04-28T15:14:00.000Z	Toma-	foug	you need to really look at where you system is bottlenecking if you want faster speeds
2007-04-28T15:14:00.000Z	foug	Toma-	ehh, i don't think sempron is what i'm lookin for.
2007-04-28T15:14:00.000Z	foug	Toma-	it's my processor for sure. Ahtlon xp 2800+
2007-04-28T15:14:00.000Z	Toma-	foug	i went from one of those to a sempron 3200 64bit cpu and its was like breathing new life into it
2007-04-28T15:15:00.000Z	foug	Toma-	but opterons dual core and core 2 duo are faster right
2007-04-28T15:15:00.000Z	Toma-	foug	marginally. dont expect twice the speed
2007-04-28T15:16:00.000Z	foug	Toma-	mmm
2007-04-28T15:16:00.000Z	Toma-	foug	just remember, when it comes to CPUS, itll be out of date within a few weeks
2007-04-28T15:16:00.000Z	foug	Toma-	is there a terminal command i can use to find out my processor info?
2007-04-28T15:17:00.000Z	Toma-	foug	'cat /proc/cpuinfo'
2007-04-28T15:18:00.000Z	foug	Toma-	it says this sempron is 1600mhz, mine is 1800mhz it says
2007-04-28T15:19:00.000Z	Toma-	foug	hu?
2007-04-28T15:19:00.000Z	foug	Toma-	i just don't understand processors, lol
2007-04-28T15:19:00.000Z	Toma-	foug	they sux :)
