2011-08-01T06:03:00.000Z	JoseP		ok so the server is working fine and all until it goes idle. Then it's super slow. Once you enter your password and what not again, it's pretty decent
2011-08-01T06:04:00.000Z	JoseP		that's what's going on ActionParsnip
2011-08-01T06:06:00.000Z	JoseP		hmm ok
2011-08-01T06:06:00.000Z	JoseP		also
2011-08-01T06:06:00.000Z	JoseP		when trying to install 10.04 on another server, this is what I get

2011-08-01T06:06:00.000Z	dli	JoseP	could it be powersaver? or cpufreq?
2011-08-01T06:07:00.000Z	dli	JoseP	first, try to get some idea, how it runs slow
2011-08-01T06:08:00.000Z	dli	JoseP	how do you find that out?
2011-08-01T06:09:00.000Z	dli	JoseP	it happens to ssh only, or have tested other stuff
2011-08-01T06:09:00.000Z	JoseP	dli	picture this
2011-08-01T06:10:00.000Z	dli	JoseP	if you keep your ssh session open, does it ever slow down?
2011-08-01T06:10:00.000Z	dli	JoseP	it sounds like ssh login issue, rather than system
2011-08-01T06:11:00.000Z	dli	JoseP	do you run screensaver?
2011-08-01T06:12:00.000Z	dli	JoseP	I'm helping you on troubleshooting :(
2011-08-01T06:13:00.000Z	dli	JoseP	does screen goes blank currently?
2011-08-01T06:14:00.000Z	dli	JoseP	if you want to test speed, you may simply run some cron job to measure speed by itself
2011-08-01T06:15:00.000Z	dli	JoseP	disable power-manager powersaving, disable any cpufreq
2011-08-01T06:17:00.000Z	JoseP	dli	the computer doesn't go to sleep... The display does
2011-08-01T06:18:00.000Z	dli	JoseP	disable all powersaving features, like hard drive to sleep
2011-08-01T06:20:00.000Z	dli	JoseP	again, I suggest you to enable public key login for ssh, disable UseDNS for ssh, and try again to check ssh login speed
2011-08-01T06:20:00.000Z	JoseP	dli	it's not just ssh
