2005-10-13T15:49:00.000Z	Skapare		so what is the ultimate advantage of Ubuntu over Debian for a desktop?
2005-10-13T15:50:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Skapare	: ubuntu is more suited for the desktop
2005-10-13T15:50:00.000Z	Skapare	lsuactiafner	people say that, but in what way?
2005-10-13T15:51:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Skapare	: packages are newer and made for desktops.
2005-10-13T15:53:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Skapare	: but slackware doesnt have packages, but i'm not saying ubuntu is better than slackware, ubuntu is better suited to the lazy and the noobs and ppl with no tech ability
2005-10-13T15:53:00.000Z	Skapare	lsuactiafner	slackware has packages ... I've installed them
2005-10-13T15:53:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Skapare	: and desktop users.. i fall into the lazy part, tho my system is a hyrbid ubuntu and slackware
2005-10-13T15:55:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Skapare	: i used to run slackware but now i run ubuntu, before ubuntu i used slackware for 4 years
2005-10-13T15:56:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Skapare	: same
2005-10-13T15:58:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Skapare	: i run a slackware server also, feels more secure since i know slackware better.
2005-10-13T15:58:00.000Z	Skapare	lsuactiafner	I know the feeling
2005-10-13T15:59:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Skapare	: but you should really give ubuntu the benefit of the doubt
2005-10-13T15:59:00.000Z	Skapare	lsuactiafner	but for having a CD to quickly install a desktop for someone, I think maybe Ubuntu will work out better
2005-10-13T15:59:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Skapare	: i'm glad i switched my dekstop over to ubuntu
2005-10-13T15:59:00.000Z	Skapare	lsuactiafner	but what I am interested in is how I might be able to adapt Ubuntu to being server grade
2005-10-14T16:00:00.000Z	Skapare	lsuactiafner	to get that same secure and "in control" feeling that way
2005-10-14T16:00:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Skapare	: i think it is server grade, you just need to know what you're doing like with slackware
2005-10-14T16:01:00.000Z	Skapare	lsuactiafner	for one thing (since I am a C coder) having the system running exactly from source code I have compiled gives me a warm and fuzzy knowing I can hack the code if I ever need to (and it has happened)
2005-10-14T16:01:00.000Z	Skapare	lsuactiafner	I don't even use slackware's installer anymore
2005-10-14T16:01:00.000Z	Skapare	lsuactiafner	I wrote a script that takes the slackware package tree and builds the system in a subdirectory
2005-10-14T16:02:00.000Z	Skapare	lsuactiafner	then I can rsync that subdirectory to a target system ... and voila a new slackware box
2005-10-14T16:02:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Skapare	: upload somewhere and priv me the link, am going afk
