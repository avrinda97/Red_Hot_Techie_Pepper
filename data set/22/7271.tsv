2006-05-17T08:07:00.000Z	hastesaver		what is vmware? Can I use it to install another OS on top of Ubuntu?
2006-05-17T08:07:00.000Z	Ng	hastesaver	it's a virtualisation system - it creates a virtual PC you can install another OS into
2006-05-17T08:07:00.000Z	hastesaver	Ng	and is it free?
2006-05-17T08:07:00.000Z	Ng	hastesaver	nope
2006-05-17T08:08:00.000Z	Ng	hastesaver	they do a free "player", but you can't install an OS with it, just run an existing image
2006-05-17T08:08:00.000Z	hastesaver	Ng	and what about the free "server"?
2006-05-17T08:08:00.000Z	Ng	hastesaver	no idea, not touched it, but it's probably way overkill for what you want
2006-05-17T08:09:00.000Z	hastesaver	Ng	oh, thanks. The one I want is "VMWare Workstation" then?
2006-05-17T08:09:00.000Z	Ng	hastesaver	I reckon so, yeah
2006-05-17T08:10:00.000Z	hastesaver	Ng	thanks. Do you know of any free alternatives?
2006-05-21T16:35:00.000Z	Ng	hastesaver	consult vmware's install docs, then install windows inside it. that's kinda outside the scope of this channel really
2006-05-21T16:36:00.000Z	hastesaver	Ng	I understand that, I wanted to know if someone has a link to the docs, actually. (or something like https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WindowsXPUnderQemuHowTo )
2006-05-21T16:44:00.000Z	Ng	hastesaver	break things mostly ;)
2006-05-21T16:45:00.000Z	Ng	hastesaver	the idea is that you can install software manually, but checkinstall will keep track of it
2006-05-21T16:45:00.000Z	hastesaver	Ng	oh, so is it recommended to use it or not?
2006-05-21T16:45:00.000Z	Ng	hastesaver	personally I don't like it, but other people do, so I guess it's a personal preference thing. I generally try to avoid installing any software manually if possible anyway
2006-05-21T16:45:00.000Z	hastesaver	Ng	Does it keep track of what arbitrary scripts do?!
2006-05-21T16:46:00.000Z	Ng	hastesaver	for any given piece of software it may work perfectly, partially or not at all. So, it's not a helpful answer, but I would say.... maybe
2006-05-23T16:30:00.000Z	Ng	hastesaver	/var/log/auth.log
2006-05-23T16:31:00.000Z	hastesaver	Ng	Hmm, I see lots of people have been trying! What should I do about it?!
2006-05-23T16:32:00.000Z	Ng	hastesaver	that's up to you - personally I just make sure that my passwords are strong and the system is up-to-date, but you can move it to another port or require ssh keys if you like
2006-05-23T16:32:00.000Z	hastesaver	Ng	ok, so it's not a problem? The same user has been trying lots of random usernames :)
