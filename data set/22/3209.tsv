2009-10-02T06:42:00.000Z	Roasted		anybody use cairo dock? I downloaded it yet, I somehow... cant find it?
2009-10-02T06:43:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	as in you can't find the deb or how to run it while installed via apt-get/synaptic
2009-10-02T06:44:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	normally it is listed under System Tools.. you can also launch it via command line by typing cairo-dock &disown   .so that it isn't stuck to  your terminal
2009-10-02T06:46:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	sometimes the menu isn't updated for a bit. possibly log out then back in.
2009-10-02T06:47:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	it has lots of things including widgets of sorts.
2009-10-02T06:48:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	probably the best way to enjoy cairo-dock is to get the latest .deb as version 2.X is far better than the 1.6 versino in synaptic
2009-10-02T06:49:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	i have a link for the .debs if you wish.
2009-10-02T06:50:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8724  get the cairo-dock and the plugins.. install the dock first then plugins
2009-10-02T06:51:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	uninstall the cairo-dock you install via synaptic before using the newer .debs
2009-10-02T06:52:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	Roasted get the _x86_64.deb's
2009-10-02T06:55:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	cool, try out some of the themes.. also you can mix match icons/themes and create your own. good luck
2010-01-21T02:23:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	possibly look into cairo-dock. you can use it without compisiting
2010-01-21T02:24:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	i've been using it almost 2 years.. on all 3 of my boxes.
2010-01-21T02:24:00.000Z	Roasted	bastid_raZor	I had it on 3 of my boxes... and all 3 had different issues. Does the control panel look any better by now?
2010-01-21T02:27:00.000Z	Roasted	bastid_raZor	how do I get cairo to move horizontally?
2010-01-21T02:30:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	cairo-dock has many many options to dig through. there is a #cairo-dock channel
2010-01-21T02:30:00.000Z	Roasted	bastid_raZor	yeah. I see that. I see I have a ton of customizing to do so its not so... eh
2010-04-20T10:23:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	just change mirros for medibuntu and all set
2010-04-20T10:23:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	as ZykoticK9 suggested with the link
2010-05-13T00:50:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	ifconfig
2010-05-21T09:22:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Roasted	maybe that network has MAC address filtering enabled.
2010-05-21T09:22:00.000Z	Roasted	bastid_raZor	nope. I manage the network. :(
