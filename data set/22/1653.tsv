2011-02-08T20:23:00.000Z	RedXIII		Can anyone help me? Whenever I do glxgears it says segmentation fault.
2011-02-08T20:23:00.000Z	RedXIII		same with glxdemo
2011-02-08T20:24:00.000Z	RedXIII		and the same with glxinfo
2011-02-08T20:24:00.000Z	MikeChelen	RedXIII	what video card and drivers?
2011-02-08T20:25:00.000Z	RedXIII	MikeChelen	ATI mobility radeon 5730, and the proprietary one from additional driver
2011-02-08T20:26:00.000Z	MikeChelen	RedXIII	could try uninstalling it then reinstalling
2011-02-08T20:26:00.000Z	RedXIII	MikeChelen	Which one is the driver? I end up with 2 VGA controllers
2011-02-08T20:27:00.000Z	MikeChelen	RedXIII	where do you see 2 vga controllers listed? also try fglrxinfo
2011-02-08T20:27:00.000Z	RedXIII	MikeChelen	Segmentation fault
2011-02-08T20:28:00.000Z	MikeChelen	RedXIII	guess there could be more that one vid card in the system? could try disabling one in bios
2011-02-08T20:28:00.000Z	MikeChelen	RedXIII	this command sometimes helps me: sudo aticonfig --initial
2011-02-08T20:28:00.000Z	RedXIII	MikeChelen	Do I -have- to disable the discrete graphics for ubuntu to work?
2011-02-08T20:29:00.000Z	MikeChelen	RedXIII	probably not, just might make things easier
2011-02-08T20:30:00.000Z	MikeChelen	RedXIII	might want to open synaptic and see if you really have the fglrx packages installed ok
2011-02-08T20:31:00.000Z	RedXIII	MikeChelen	It says installed
2011-02-08T20:31:00.000Z	MikeChelen	RedXIII	which packages are installed already, all the ones from a fglrx search?
2011-02-08T20:31:00.000Z	MikeChelen	RedXIII	might not hurt to reinstall
2011-02-08T20:33:00.000Z	RedXIII	MikeChelen	Maybe the intel video card is screwing things up
2011-02-08T20:33:00.000Z	MikeChelen	RedXIII	try searching to see if some intel driver got installed by mistake? what you should see when installing the fglrx driver is that it recompiles the kernel with dkms and such
2011-02-08T20:34:00.000Z	MikeChelen	RedXIII	also could try reinstalling fglrx from command line to look for errors
2011-02-08T20:35:00.000Z	MikeChelen	RedXIII	if it is an intel card maybe search for intel in synaptic? also might want to use a grub editor to select an old kernel if the problem appeared recently
2011-02-08T20:36:00.000Z	RedXIII	MikeChelen	I uninstalled my old kernels D:
