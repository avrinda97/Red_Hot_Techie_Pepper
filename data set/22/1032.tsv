2010-11-07T07:16:00.000Z	icarus-c	SC-M	you could select your language at logon
2010-11-07T07:26:00.000Z	icarus-c	SC-M	basically when you do anything that affect other users on the system or acts that risk security, you need root
2010-11-07T07:26:00.000Z	icarus-c	SC-M	correct
2010-11-07T07:30:00.000Z	icarus-c	SC-M	root is the user with the highest privilege
2010-11-07T07:31:00.000Z	icarus-c	SC-M	that is something else..
2010-11-07T07:32:00.000Z	icarus-c	SC-M	eh wait, are you speaking of email users or like when you ssh
2010-11-07T07:32:00.000Z	SC-M	icarus-c	it's only example of terminal
2010-11-07T07:32:00.000Z	icarus-c	SC-M	note that the terminal prompt message is adjustable :P
2010-11-07T07:33:00.000Z	SC-M	icarus-c	but the access cannot be adjust...
2010-11-07T07:39:00.000Z	icarus-c	SC-M	System -> Preferences -> Appearance
2010-11-07T07:42:00.000Z	icarus-c	SC-M	yes
