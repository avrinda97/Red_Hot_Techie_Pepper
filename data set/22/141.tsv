2012-05-25T19:23:00.000Z	poire21		Hi, my first time here. Can't login to my Ubuntu 12.04 setup, seems to be a problem with video. Thought maybe the update to Xorg...
2012-05-25T19:24:00.000Z	sandyd	poire21	why can't you login? Password not accepting? screen not turning on?
2012-05-25T19:24:00.000Z	poire21		Screen turns on, but instead of the usuall login screen (with familiar wallpaper) I get a terminal-esque screen stating the name of my computer and asking for my login (username) and then my password
2012-05-25T19:25:00.000Z	sandyd	poire21	Looks like Xorg died. What video card you using?
2012-05-25T19:26:00.000Z	sandyd	poire21	you installed any proprietary drivers
2012-05-25T19:26:00.000Z	sandyd	poire21	from the additional drivers (jockey) thingy
2012-05-25T19:26:00.000Z	poire21		I have an AMD Radeon 6870 1GB
2012-05-25T19:26:00.000Z	poire21		Yes I had Catalyst installed from AMD
2012-05-25T19:27:00.000Z	poire21		I had installed directly from AMD site
2012-05-25T19:27:00.000Z	sandyd	poire21	ah.
2012-05-25T19:27:00.000Z	sandyd	poire21	there is the problem.
2012-05-25T19:27:00.000Z	sandyd	poire21	the one on the site does not rebuild whenever you update to a new kernel.
2012-05-25T19:27:00.000Z	poire21		worked great, I simply rebooted after an update, which I seem to recall included Xorg
2012-05-25T19:28:00.000Z	poire21		oh... crappy
2012-05-25T19:28:00.000Z	sandyd	poire21	you need to remove the driver you installed, and reconfigure xorg
2012-05-25T19:28:00.000Z	sandyd	poire21	Ill send you a wiki page on how to do that
2012-05-25T19:28:00.000Z	poire21		Thank you so much!

2012-05-25T19:32:00.000Z	poire21	sandyd	so I have not worked in that mode before; should I just type the commands on the terminal-esque screen (after I input my login), or should I go to recovery mode
2012-05-25T19:33:00.000Z	sandyd	poire21	Their the same
2012-05-25T19:34:00.000Z	poire21	sandyd	Thank you so much for your help! Hopefully you won't see me here again in a few minutes ;-)
2012-05-25T19:34:00.000Z	sandyd	poire21	your welcome :)
