2005-11-10T10:02:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	xfree86-dri?  ubuntu uses X.org
2005-11-10T10:12:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	which driver are you wanting to use?  The free one, or the binary one from ATI?
2005-11-10T10:12:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	no need to reboot
2005-11-10T10:13:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	just check /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and see what driver it's using first
2005-11-10T10:15:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	okay, you're using the binary one.  Did you follow the BinaryDriverHowto for installing that?
2005-11-10T10:16:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	please follow that wiki page carefully
2005-11-10T10:31:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	what's the problem with fglrx?
2005-11-10T10:31:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	did you check your /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
2005-11-10T10:36:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	did you check your /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?

2005-11-10T10:38:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	please paste your /var/log/Xorg.0.log on pastebin
2005-11-10T10:40:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	still waiting for you to paste your Xorg.0.log
2005-11-10T11:26:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	I gave you an ATI wiki page for that
2005-11-10T11:58:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	are you also on a 64-bit machine?
2005-11-10T11:59:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	oh, no wonder...
2005-11-10T12:03:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	if you install that, which you certainly can if you want, we'll be unable to support you if you have problems
2005-11-10T12:03:00.000Z	tritium	magpie	yes
