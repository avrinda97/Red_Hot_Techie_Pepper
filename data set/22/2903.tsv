2009-01-30T22:21:00.000Z	Abula		i loved ubuntu, but moved back to windows because of not being able to produce music
2009-01-30T22:22:00.000Z	Abula		yeah mate
2009-01-30T22:22:00.000Z	Abula		as good as it is,
2009-01-30T22:22:00.000Z	Abula		it's just not powerful enough for the kind of music i produce
