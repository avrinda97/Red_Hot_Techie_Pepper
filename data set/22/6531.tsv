2007-05-16T09:06:00.000Z	craigbass1976		Anyone familiar with bind setup on dapper?  I'm having trouble with te named.conf.local file.
2007-05-16T09:06:00.000Z	macd	craigbass1976	thats more of a bind issue than ubuntu
2007-05-16T09:18:00.000Z	craigbass1976	macd	can you look through http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/DNSServerBind and see if you see anything screwy with the /etc/bind/named.conf.local setup?
2007-05-16T09:18:00.000Z	macd	craigbass1976	huh?
2007-05-16T09:18:00.000Z	macd	craigbass1976	you'll have to paste your named.conf.local file
2007-05-16T09:19:00.000Z	macd	craigbass1976	unless of course your copy/pasting form the howto?
2007-05-16T09:20:00.000Z	craigbass1976	macd	http://rafb.net/p/XOaNG543.html   Line 3 is the problem
2007-05-16T09:21:00.000Z	macd	craigbass1976	do you have a file named domainname.come.db ?
2007-05-16T09:22:00.000Z	craigbass1976	macd	yes, and also the arpa one
2007-05-16T09:23:00.000Z	macd	craigbass1976	and they have the proper permissions? (I just dont know the parse order for bind so elimintaing everything)
2007-05-16T09:24:00.000Z	craigbass1976	macd	Well I just chowned them both so bind owned them, and still same error.
2007-05-16T09:25:00.000Z	macd	craigbass1976	what exact error is bind spitting at you?
2007-05-16T09:26:00.000Z	craigbass1976	macd	expected quoted string.  Forget it, I'm starting over.
2007-05-16T09:26:00.000Z	macd	craigbass1976	ohh, you got whitespace!
2007-05-16T09:27:00.000Z	macd	craigbass1976	or if you want something more robust than bind, look@ pdns.
2007-05-16T09:27:00.000Z	craigbass1976	macd	is that apt-able?
2007-05-16T09:27:00.000Z	craigbass1976	macd	bind is the biggest wench
2007-05-16T09:28:00.000Z	macd	craigbass1976	yeah it is, I dont know why it didnt showup
2007-05-16T09:28:00.000Z	macd	craigbass1976	do 'apt-cache search pdns'  you'll see it.
2007-05-16T09:29:00.000Z	macd	craigbass1976	it also has a sql backend, so you can make domain changes on the fly, and I'll plug myself here http://sourceforge.net/projects/publicdnsadmin/  is a php frontend for managing zones. (Im the developer)
2007-05-16T09:29:00.000Z	craigbass1976	macd	got it already.  Thanks.  I was hoping to get tinydns up but had some issues with that as well
2007-05-16T09:30:00.000Z	craigbass1976	macd	well, I'll plug myself to then... openinvoice on sourceforge is a series of bash scripts with a OpenOffice frontend and a mysql backend that is a FIFO inventorying system.  Feel free to make the whole thing php! :)
