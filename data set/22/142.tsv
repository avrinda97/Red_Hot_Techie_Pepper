2012-05-28T13:06:00.000Z	EliahKagan	Anom	while i like LXDE very much, i find that it's still a bit rough around the edges, being a relatively newer desktop environment...i would consider Xfce to be more refined
2012-05-28T13:06:00.000Z	Anom	EliahKagan	Wheres its downfall?
2012-05-28T13:07:00.000Z	EliahKagan	Anom	LXDE's or Xfce's?
2012-05-28T13:09:00.000Z	EliahKagan	Anom	the biggest issue i've been having is that PCManFM (the file browser) crashes sometimes, including sometimes during a file transfer (i've stopped copying big files with it), and sometimes it doesn't automatically reload afterwards (which is bad because it's what gives you the desktop, after all...but you can reload it manually with: pcmanfm --desktop )
2012-05-28T13:10:00.000Z	Anom	EliahKagan	Thanks for the heads up *writes down command*
2012-05-28T13:12:00.000Z	EliahKagan	Anom	the second most annoying thing i've experienced is that sometimes the volume control applet in the notification area doesn't respond to being clicked ...but i don't think a lot of users experience that problem
2012-05-28T13:14:00.000Z	EliahKagan	Anom	do you mean with file:/// ?
2012-05-28T13:15:00.000Z	Anom	EliahKagan	Not sure what you mean? If I open up a folder on my desktop I can see 'mac data' etc which are hosted on a windows server in the office. But when attaching files via chrome or ff I can only see local files?
2012-05-28T13:15:00.000Z	EliahKagan	Anom	oh i see
2012-05-28T13:15:00.000Z	Anom	EliahKagan	Bit of a pain that I need to copy files to my desktop first before I can attach them or vice-versa..
2012-05-28T13:16:00.000Z	EliahKagan	Anom	yeah i think there is a bug reported for this ...anyway, you *should* be able to access your network drives, they're just not mounted in the same place as your local drives (when they are mounted by Nautilus / PCManFM)
2012-05-28T13:17:00.000Z	EliahKagan	Anom	there is a .gvfs folder in your home folder, you can see if your network drives are accessible inside there
2012-05-28T13:17:00.000Z	EliahKagan	Anom	you need to show hidden files (Ctrl+H) to see it
2012-05-28T13:17:00.000Z	Anom	EliahKagan	Yeah I'm in. I can see 'mac data' in it - Which is what I want to see in chrome.
2012-05-28T13:19:00.000Z	Anom	EliahKagan	Ah, so I'll need to go in via chrome to home/.gvfs
2012-05-28T13:19:00.000Z	EliahKagan	Anom	yes, that will probably work
2012-05-28T13:19:00.000Z	EliahKagan	Anom	but the other thing to consider is that some websites where you upload files (e.g., Gmail) let you just drag the file icon into the web page
2012-05-28T13:20:00.000Z	EliahKagan	Anom	so you can drag it from the file browser (Nautilus in Ubuntu ...PCManFM in Lubuntu)
2012-05-28T13:22:00.000Z	EliahKagan	Anom	this is *a* bug report for this problem, but i'm not sure it's the one i was thinking of, which i recall was not specific to Chrome/Chromium (and it shouldn't necessarily be, because individual applications *shouldn't* have to do the work themselves of showing gvfs mounts with other mounts): https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/chromium-browser/+bug/796689
2012-05-28T13:23:00.000Z	Anom	EliahKagan	Thanks! :). I've just bookedmarked .gvfs in my chrome file browser. Seems to have stuck.
2012-05-28T13:23:00.000Z	EliahKagan	Anom	cool, i'm glad you got a solution that works for you
2012-05-28T13:25:00.000Z	EliahKagan	Anom	personally (though for unrelated reasons, mostly so they can be accessed by multiple user accounts in the same place and survive logging in and out and can be mounted and unmounted easily from the command-line including remotely via SSH), i just "hard-mount" my network shares, for example: sudo smbmount //Del/Beltrami /media/Beltrami -o user=ek
