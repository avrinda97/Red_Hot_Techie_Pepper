2012-09-15T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	iwert	what do you actually want to know?  How to properly install java?
2012-09-15T18:07:00.000Z	jrib	iwert	why not read the link Dr_willis had ubottu give you on the wiki?
2012-09-15T18:12:00.000Z	jrib	iwert	where did you find that link?
2012-09-15T18:12:00.000Z	jrib	iwert	not in this channel
2012-09-15T18:13:00.000Z	jrib	iwert	in any case, it seems sane.  What is it exactly that you do that doesn't work?  Use a pastebin to show what you type and full output
2012-09-15T18:14:00.000Z	jrib	iwert	you need to do the first step (download the file)
2012-09-15T18:14:00.000Z	jrib	iwert	then you need to be in the directory where the file is to run your tar command
2012-09-15T18:18:00.000Z	jrib	iwert	you're being too vague.
2012-09-15T18:19:00.000Z	jrib	iwert	you say you "installed 2 things of java".  What things?  What exactly did you do?  (use paste.ubuntu.com if your reply is many lines).  You also say "its still not working".  What is not working?  How are you determining it is not working?
2012-09-15T18:23:00.000Z	jrib	iwert	which part do you not understand?
2012-09-15T18:23:00.000Z	jrib	iwert	if you right click on the file, you will see the permissions for it.  To execute a file, it must have the execute permissions
2012-09-15T18:25:00.000Z	jrib	iwert	we can only answer the questions asked
2012-09-15T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	iwert	I don't know of a video tutorial, but that manual along with help.ubuntu.com are good places to start
