2010-06-17T06:55:00.000Z	stayf		my cd drive is not fast enough to install ubuntu and i need an alternate install option
2010-06-17T06:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stayf	What do you mean "not fast enough"? Does the install actually fail, or is it just too slow for you?
2010-06-17T06:56:00.000Z	stayf	Jordan_U	it failed
2010-06-17T06:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stayf	What was the exact error?
2010-06-17T07:42:00.000Z	stayf	Jordan_U	that's desktop edition?
2010-06-17T07:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stayf	A smaller CD might be less likely to have errors. If you use the netboot CD rather than the minimal CD it's even smaller, and will only read the CD once during boot (everything it needs from the CD is loaded immediately into RAM, then the rest grabbed from the network)
2010-06-17T07:43:00.000Z	stayf	Jordan_U	sounds great. it's ubuntu desktop correct?
2010-06-17T07:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stayf	It will result in the same installation (if you choose the defaults), but the installer is pseudo text based and ugly as sin :)
2010-06-17T07:44:00.000Z	stayf	Jordan_U	thank you so much :D
2010-06-17T07:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stayf	You're welcome :)
2010-06-17T07:50:00.000Z	stayf	Jordan_U	is this a minimal version of ubuntu?
2010-06-17T07:50:00.000Z	stayf	Jordan_U	it's a full installation, just a minimal disk. correct?
2010-06-17T07:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stayf	Correct.
2010-06-17T07:50:00.000Z	stayf	Jordan_U	server edition / desktop edition? it reminds me VERY much of the server installation
2010-06-17T07:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stayf	It's exactly the same installer as used with Ubuntu server
2010-06-17T07:51:00.000Z	stayf	Jordan_U	so i'm installing ubuntu server?
2010-06-17T07:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stayf	No, it's the same installer with different default options.
2010-06-17T07:52:00.000Z	stayf	Jordan_U	it's desktop? just verifying in plain text
2010-06-17T07:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stayf	Yes.
2010-06-17T07:52:00.000Z	stayf	Jordan_U	k
2010-06-17T07:52:00.000Z	stayf	Jordan_U	thank you
