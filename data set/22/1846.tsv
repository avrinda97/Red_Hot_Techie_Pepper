2009-12-22T08:28:00.000Z	protojay		ewww linux can be irritating at times
2009-12-22T08:30:00.000Z	protojay		Ok..! im trying to instal some software under wine but it spans multiple disks, how do i unmount the cdrom in order to change disks when the installer asks for it?
2009-12-22T08:31:00.000Z	protojay		!virtualizers
2009-12-22T08:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	Virtualbox :)
2009-12-22T08:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	the non free, is free as in price, not freedom
2009-12-22T08:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	it also has USB support unlike the Open Source Edition
2009-12-22T08:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	as of Virtualbox 3.0 there is some Direct3D 8 support, that you could try for a few games,  it might be alright, depending on game, and your computer
2009-12-22T08:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	plus there are some pretty good native Linux games :)
2009-12-22T08:38:00.000Z	protojay	sebsebseb	do i need a fresh copy of windows or is windows emulated ala wine?
2009-12-22T08:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	Wine does not run Windows,  it gives you basically a sort of fake WIndows install,  that then tricks many Windows apps into thinking (well apps don't think, but you get the idea I guess)  that they are running on Windows
2009-12-22T08:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	quite a lot of apps just work and work well, others need some configuring
2009-12-22T08:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	it's also not an enulater, it's a compatability layour, for  running Windows apps
2009-12-22T08:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	then for real Windows and other OS's even,  virtual machines :)
2009-12-22T08:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	some things a vm can't do,  but you can do most Windows stuff in a vm, depending on your computer, how much RAM you have and such
2009-12-22T08:42:00.000Z	protojay	sebsebseb	so if i use an virtualmachine, i need a copy of windows on cd/dvd to install?
2009-12-22T08:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	yes or an ISO
2009-12-22T08:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	however when it comes to apps this is how it should be done really :)  1.  native Linux apps :)   2.  Wine  or even commercial paid for versions of it.  3.  virtual machine  4.  psyical Windows install
2009-12-22T08:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	1. will fit most computer needs :)
2009-12-22T08:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	hardware issues such as?
2009-12-22T08:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	that's good your blaming the lap top not Ubuntu :)  yeah Ubuntu on hardware that isn't supported properly by it can be a pain, since lack of manufacture support
2009-12-22T08:46:00.000Z	protojay	sebsebseb	oh, its problems ive had for ages while running windows, cdrom takes AGEEES to read certain dvds or cds
2009-12-22T08:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	protojay	oh that issue is on Windows as well hmm,  could be a failing cdrom drive
