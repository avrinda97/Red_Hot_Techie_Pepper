2005-05-29T11:59:00.000Z	Laforge		hello, does anyone know how to set up ethernet on ubuntu
2005-05-29T11:59:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	haven't you been asking that over and over for days now?
2005-05-29T11:59:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	your question needs to be WAY more detailed before people can even start to help you
2005-05-29T12:02:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	so, ignore the gui stuff
2005-05-29T12:02:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	now, run "dmesg | grep ^eth" in a terminal and show us what it prints out
2005-05-29T12:04:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	exactly as I typed it
2005-05-29T12:04:00.000Z	Laforge	bob2	it doesn't give me anything
2005-05-29T12:05:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	ok, can you paste the output of "lspci -v" to #flood?
2005-05-29T12:06:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	well, type out EXACTLY what "lspci | grep Ether" prints out
2005-05-29T12:09:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	that's all it says?
2005-05-29T12:09:00.000Z	Laforge	bob2	yes
2005-05-29T12:14:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	that pci id is very suss
2005-05-29T12:15:00.000Z	Laforge	bob2	why?
2005-05-29T12:22:00.000Z	Laforge	bob2	what if it is the same network card?
2005-05-29T12:27:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	I doubt it will help, but it's worth a try, I guess
2005-05-29T12:27:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	is it a very new card?
2005-05-29T12:30:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	a NIC, sure.
2005-05-29T12:31:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	I don't know what you want to do
2005-05-29T12:31:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	if you want one that works under linux, basically any should
2005-05-29T12:32:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	if you're going to buy one, don't by the same, that's just silly
2005-05-29T12:34:00.000Z	Laforge	bob2	i have an extra one from my old old machine, and i realized it has the same card
2005-05-29T13:01:00.000Z	bob2	Laforge	are you sure it's a PCI card?
