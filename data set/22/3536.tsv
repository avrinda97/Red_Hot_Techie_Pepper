2009-02-14T02:38:00.000Z	guntbert	jungar	I had proposed but turned them off, they gave me troubles, but I suppose I will get the new kernel in a few days and I'm more of the patient type :)

2009-02-14T02:50:00.000Z	guntbert	jungar	good boy :), you can let the system find the "best" server for you too
2009-02-14T02:50:00.000Z	jungar	guntbert	youre reading my mind ;p im doing the best server before you told me
2009-02-14T02:51:00.000Z	jungar	guntbert	the best is in Malta???? hahahahaha   is that OK?? or will my updates be in malteese language???
2009-02-14T02:52:00.000Z	guntbert	jungar	although my crystal ball is a bit cloudy tonight :), I'd stick to a server in the UK, but the repos are the same all around the world (even here in AT)
2009-02-14T02:53:00.000Z	jungar	guntbert	you have a crystal GUN ;p
