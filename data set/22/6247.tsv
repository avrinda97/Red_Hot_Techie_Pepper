2007-03-23T15:24:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx		ok, to test if a joystick device is working, you'd do a 'od -xw8 /dev/input/js0', right? the output values are supposed to change while you're pessing buttons, right?
2007-03-23T15:26:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx		i'm trying to get a PSX pad (via PSX-USB converter) working under ubuntu 6.06 and its not going so well. it started working one day and i don't know why, and it stopped working when i unplugged it and plugged it back in.
2007-03-23T15:26:00.000Z	ikonia_	CoRnJuLiOx	possibly hung the usb port for that device
2007-03-23T15:27:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx	ikonia_	any way to check?
2007-03-23T15:27:00.000Z	ikonia_	CoRnJuLiOx	on replugging it back in - it may have assumed a difference device address
2007-03-23T15:27:00.000Z	ikonia_	CoRnJuLiOx	check your sys log for starters
2007-03-23T15:27:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx	ikonia_	is there anything i should keep my eyes out for?
2007-03-23T15:28:00.000Z	ikonia_	CoRnJuLiOx	errr usb and devices and playstation for example
2007-03-23T15:30:00.000Z	ikonia_	CoRnJuLiOx	ok - so you can see its being recognised
2007-03-23T15:31:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx	ikonia_	but whenever i try to configure in padjoy, it looks like it gets the device file opened, but doesn't receive input
2007-03-23T15:32:00.000Z	ikonia_	CoRnJuLiOx	I've given you pointers on where and what to look for. What device ID is it currently using ?
2007-03-23T15:34:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx	ikonia_	is it this? [HID 0925:8866] 
2007-03-23T15:34:00.000Z	ikonia_	CoRnJuLiOx	no I mean what unix device file is it using
2007-03-23T15:35:00.000Z	ikonia_	CoRnJuLiOx	ok - so 1.) check that file exists, and the status of it, 2.) Check the sylog to see if it still believes its using that device 3.) check for other jsX devices to see if any new ones have been created
2007-03-23T15:42:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx	ikonia_	i did #1 using 'cat /dev/input/js0' and 'od -xw8 /dev/input/js0' and getting back random characters (values in the case of od), the syslog doesn't seem to report anything other then finding the device, the last thing listed in dmesg is about a hdd error and in the system log its from gconf, and  and i don't see any other jsX devices in the /dev/input folder.
2007-03-23T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia_	CoRnJuLiOx	looks like the pad configuration software is having an issue then
2007-03-23T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia_	CoRnJuLiOx	try rebooting (lame I know)
2007-03-23T15:43:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx	ikonia_	i just came from a reboot
2007-03-23T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia_	CoRnJuLiOx	no idea, never used the PS2 pads
2007-03-23T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia_	CoRnJuLiOx	you could try it
2007-03-23T15:44:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx	ikonia_	its actually a PS1
2007-03-23T15:44:00.000Z	ikonia_	CoRnJuLiOx	ok- never tried a PS1 pad
