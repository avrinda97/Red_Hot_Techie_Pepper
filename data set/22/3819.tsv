2008-05-26T22:05:00.000Z	marathe25		Inar: all right, I installed the correct backports module, but still no go
2008-05-26T22:06:00.000Z	marathe25		Inar: yes
2008-05-26T22:08:00.000Z	marathe25		is ubuntu already installed, or are you using a live cd?
2008-05-26T22:08:00.000Z	legend2440	marathe25	type uname -a in terminal does it mention SMP anywhere?
2008-05-26T22:09:00.000Z	marathe25	legend2440	yes, it does
2008-05-26T22:09:00.000Z	legend2440	marathe25	then dual core should work
2008-05-26T22:09:00.000Z	marathe25		well, tell that to my box
2008-05-26T22:10:00.000Z	legend2440	marathe25	lol
2008-05-26T22:11:00.000Z	legend2440	marathe25	how do you know only 1 is working? checked in system monitor?
2008-05-26T22:12:00.000Z	marathe25	legend2440	that, and cat /proc/cpuinfo lists only one core
2008-05-26T22:12:00.000Z	legend2440	marathe25	oh ok
2008-05-26T22:14:00.000Z	legend2440	marathe25	is there a setting in the BIOS to enable dual core?
2008-05-26T22:24:00.000Z	marathe25		Still having problems with Ubuntu only using one core of my AMDX2 system. Can anybody help?
2008-05-26T22:24:00.000Z	legend2440	marathe25	is there a setting in the BIOS to enable dual core?
2008-05-26T22:25:00.000Z	marathe25	legend2440	I'm not sure, I haven't check. It worked OOB with the amd64 version of Hardy, though, so I don't think it's a BIOS issue
2008-05-26T22:27:00.000Z	legend2440	marathe25	are you using the generic kernel?    2.6.24-16-generic #1 SMP
2008-05-26T22:28:00.000Z	marathe25	legend2440	well, it's 2.6.24-17-generic
2008-05-26T22:29:00.000Z	legend2440	marathe25	have you tried different kernels by selecting them in startup manager and rebooting?
2008-05-26T22:29:00.000Z	marathe25	legend2440	yes,
2008-05-26T22:30:00.000Z	marathe25	legend2440	the only thing that's worked is an amd64 installation, but I don't want to use that for compatibility reasons
2008-05-26T22:31:00.000Z	legend2440	marathe25	well its a bug and been reportrd but i dont see a fix listed yet   https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/213011
2008-05-26T22:31:00.000Z	marathe25	legend2440	ok, thanks
