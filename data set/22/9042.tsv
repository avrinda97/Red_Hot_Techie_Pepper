2005-06-03T05:45:00.000Z	j-rock_	Amaranth	nope
2005-06-03T05:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	j-rock_	DVDJon is the guy behind DeCSS, you have to have at least heard of that. Anyway, he's a vlc hacker.
2005-06-03T05:46:00.000Z	j-rock_	Amaranth	ohhh, yeah i know who you are talking about, never heard him called DVDjon
2005-06-03T05:46:00.000Z	j-rock_	Amaranth	damn, if he's in on the project i'll have to check it out
2005-06-03T05:46:00.000Z	Amaranth	j-rock_	he's also the one that cracked apple's DRM
