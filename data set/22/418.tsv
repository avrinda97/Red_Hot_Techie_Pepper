2012-02-20T21:59:00.000Z	k013		hi, if i'm running ubuntu on dual boot with windows can i upgrade to a newer release through windows itself? will such an operation delete all my old ubuntu content?
2012-02-20T22:01:00.000Z	k013		@thesimkin - that's the thing - ur askin me to upgrade via update manager, but i want to upgrade from iso image via wubi/ deamon tools
2012-02-20T22:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	you'd upgrade ubuntu in Ubuntu.
2012-02-20T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	did you use Wubi?
2012-02-20T22:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	i'd reinstall if you used wubi, I've heard bad results from upgrades
2012-02-20T22:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	i'd remove what you have presently, you can reinstate files and such from backup
2012-02-20T22:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	its a cleaner OS with none of the old configs could be the cause. I always clean install. Fewer issues imho
2012-02-20T22:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	its not outright better, its a personaly preference
2012-04-04T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	what GPU do you use?
2012-04-04T16:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	did you try Unity2D session?
2012-04-04T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	press CTRL+ALT+F1 and run:  killall -u $USER
2012-04-04T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	on the login screen click the cog and log in to the Unity2D session
2012-04-04T16:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	you will drop to CLI so you will have as much time as you have electricity
2012-04-04T16:52:00.000Z	k013	ActionParsnip	- thank you so much, i'll try this and get back to this channel - bye for now! thank you so much!
2012-04-04T17:01:00.000Z	k013	ActionParsnip	- i'm back, i tried ctrl+alt+f1, but the flicker is not stopping for me to type the killall command
2012-04-04T17:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	just run:   sudo reboot    then, bit easier
2012-04-04T17:03:00.000Z	k013	ActionParsnip	- no u didn't understand, the flickering screen is not stopping its continuous!
2012-04-04T17:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	reboot and at the login screen select unity2d
2012-04-04T17:05:00.000Z	k013	ActionParsnip	- i reboot number of times only to try killall command but flicker no stop, sorry!
2012-04-04T17:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	did you reboot ok?
2012-04-04T17:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	does it flicker on the login screen too?
2012-04-04T17:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	k013	does it flicker in CTRL+ALT+F1 too?
