2007-11-27T14:04:00.000Z	soundray	AverageJoe	removing grub won't help. You need something sensible to replace it with.
2007-11-27T14:05:00.000Z	AverageJoe	soundray	is that file not available on the net?
2007-11-27T14:05:00.000Z	AverageJoe		ie the one to replace grub with
2007-11-27T14:05:00.000Z	soundray	AverageJoe	no, it's specific to your setup.
2007-11-27T14:05:00.000Z	soundray	AverageJoe	so the issue is a grub error 21 when you try to boot Windows?
2007-11-27T14:06:00.000Z	AverageJoe	soundray	yeah ...what happened is i tried to install ubuntu on another hard disk using my box, but then i accidently installed grub...:(
2007-11-27T14:07:00.000Z	soundray	AverageJoe	do you have Ubuntu on the master hard disk of that system?
2007-11-27T14:07:00.000Z	AverageJoe	soundray	yeah i can do that
2007-11-27T14:07:00.000Z	soundray	AverageJoe	so it's not installed right now?

2007-11-27T14:08:00.000Z	AverageJoe	soundray	no i installed it on a secondary master, it installed grub on my windows hard disk
2007-11-27T14:09:00.000Z	soundray	AverageJoe	I have an idea
2007-11-27T14:09:00.000Z	AverageJoe		yeah
2007-11-27T14:09:00.000Z	soundray	AverageJoe	you can use a FreeDOS rescue CD to fix your MBR.
2007-11-27T14:10:00.000Z	AverageJoe	soundray	i dont have that disk...can i download it/
2007-11-27T14:10:00.000Z	soundray	AverageJoe	it's essentially the same as fixing it with a Windows disk, but you can download it for free.
