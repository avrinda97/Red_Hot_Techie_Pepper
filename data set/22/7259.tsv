2012-04-01T22:30:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	try ##hardware
2012-04-01T22:32:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	only the current desktops are available
2012-04-01T22:34:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	no-one has written one you like
2012-04-01T22:35:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	sorry no,
2012-04-01T22:38:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	if you actually give us information for a problem that needs solving, we can try
2012-04-01T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	1.) is your TV card supported in Linux 2.) is your web cam supported in Linux
2012-04-01T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	if the item is in the trash you can restore it
2012-04-01T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	that functionality already exists
2012-04-01T22:41:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	Linux does not support all hardware windows does
2012-04-01T22:41:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	you need to research if your devices have support in Linux
2012-04-01T22:43:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	I believe you can restore like windows
2012-04-01T22:44:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	ok, then you'll need to drag it out manually
2012-04-01T22:48:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	ok, you can put those drives in your /etc/fstab file to make them auto mount
2012-04-01T22:50:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	it depends how the desktop is configured
2012-04-01T22:51:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	look, let me make it clear for you. If know how to make the things automount, why are you asking "how do I make them automount" - if you want to just complain to try to make a point, don't bother, it won't end well. If you want help resolving issues, great, that's what we are here for
2012-04-01T22:52:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	then you need to log a bug
2012-04-01T22:52:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	or log a feature request
2012-04-01T22:55:00.000Z	ikonia	hungryhubby	I don't believe that is supported yet, but I don't know for certain
