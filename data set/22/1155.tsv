2011-11-06T23:24:00.000Z	Abhijit		hi
2011-11-06T23:25:00.000Z	Abhijit		does 11.10 bye defualt forces encryption of /home?
2011-11-06T23:25:00.000Z	bekks	Abhijit	No.
2011-11-06T23:25:00.000Z	Abhijit	bekks	is there any way to know if my /home is encrypted or not?
2011-11-06T23:26:00.000Z	bekks	Abhijit	Just take a look at the output of "df -h"
2012-11-25T18:09:00.000Z	bekks	Abhijit	No.
2012-11-25T18:09:00.000Z	Abhijit	bekks	why?
2012-11-25T18:09:00.000Z	bekks	Abhijit	Since there are hundreds of file in there, with different permissions.
2012-11-25T18:10:00.000Z	bekks	Abhijit	Having an empty /var means you have a broken system.
2012-11-25T18:10:00.000Z	bekks	Abhijit	That wont help you, since your /var is empty.
2012-11-25T18:21:00.000Z	bekks	Abhijit	That wont bring back the content of /var
2012-11-25T18:22:00.000Z	Abhijit	bekks	there were content inside var. i thought you are asking abour docuemnt root content for web server.
2012-11-25T18:23:00.000Z	bekks	Abhijit	You still have a broken /var, since not everything in there was 755.
2012-11-25T18:24:00.000Z	Abhijit	bekks	i will know as i go and then i will change the permission. problem is this is my production machine and i can not afford to reinstall anything. no time for that.
2012-11-25T18:24:00.000Z	Abhijit	bekks	now onwarda i will always use public document root in my /home
2012-11-25T18:24:00.000Z	bekks	Abhijit	You broke your production machine then. Do you have a backup?
2012-11-25T18:24:00.000Z	Abhijit	bekks	yes i have backup
2012-11-25T18:24:00.000Z	bekks	Abhijit	public webserver root in /home is - no good idea.
2012-11-25T18:25:00.000Z	bekks	Abhijit	Just grab your backup of /var then and repair your messed up box.
2012-11-25T18:25:00.000Z	Abhijit	bekks	it all started when i need to change permission on /magento/var and i was inside magento so i typed /var instead of var/
2012-11-25T18:25:00.000Z	Abhijit	bekks	no i dont have that kind of backup. only backup of data
2012-11-25T18:26:00.000Z	bekks	Abhijit	So you have no backup of your production machine. Set it up again.
