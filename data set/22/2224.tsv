2010-01-07T07:10:00.000Z	przemo_one	ubuntu_	or from 32 to 64. yes i know, but before was it the same architecture?

2010-01-07T07:12:00.000Z	ubuntu_	przemo_one	yea 64 bit now
2010-01-07T07:14:00.000Z	przemo_one	ubuntu_	ok few things i have on my mind now. one is to boot into your installed os somehow. i know how, but it might be not the simplast way. run grub-install. second is to remove all partitions form your drive. make it totally clean. then reboot and do install.
2010-01-07T07:22:00.000Z	przemo_one	ubuntu_	get system rescue cd, burn. boot. at lilo type rescue64 root=/dev/sda1
