2010-02-26T06:54:00.000Z	joeblob		local transfers on my wrt54g are more like 8mbps isntead of 54mbps
2010-02-26T06:54:00.000Z	joeblob		how do I fix that?
2010-02-26T06:56:00.000Z	joeblob		no
2010-02-26T06:56:00.000Z	joeblob		it's the slow file transfer that is telling me that it's less
2010-02-26T06:56:00.000Z	joeblob		which terms would those be?
2010-02-26T06:56:00.000Z	ki4cgp	joeblob	that is the difference between 54 Mbits/sec and 8Mbytes/sec
2010-02-26T06:56:00.000Z	joeblob		I'm getting about 1MB/sec (10mbps)
2010-02-26T06:56:00.000Z	joeblob		yes
2010-02-26T06:56:00.000Z	joeblob		I realize that
2010-02-26T06:57:00.000Z	joeblob		which is why I expected I would be transferring faster than 8mbps
2010-02-26T06:57:00.000Z	joeblob		no...
2010-02-26T06:57:00.000Z	joeblob		I get more like 1 mega BYTES
2010-02-26T06:57:00.000Z	joeblob		when I should be getting 8
2010-02-26T06:57:00.000Z	joeblob		someone mentioned that since I'm using it as a gateway for WAN that it's limited to the bus speed of 10mbps
2010-02-26T06:58:00.000Z	joeblob		do I need to bridge two WRT54Gs together in WDS to get 54mbps on LAN?
2010-02-26T06:58:00.000Z	joeblob	Nitsuga	yes
2010-02-26T06:58:00.000Z	joeblob		because virtualgirl is naughty
2010-02-26T06:59:00.000Z	ki4cgp	joeblob	I'm using my dsl router as a gateway of course, but I get about 10-11MBytes/sec inside my LAN
2010-02-26T06:59:00.000Z	joeblob	Nitsuga	it happens with Samba transfers as well... I think it's because I'm using my WRT54g as a WAN gateway
2010-02-26T07:00:00.000Z	joeblob		it is using WEP... but will it really make the difference between 8mbps and 54mbps?
2010-02-26T07:02:00.000Z	joeblob		ok
2010-02-26T07:02:00.000Z	ki4cgp	joeblob	my apologies. those are my transfer speeds using cat-5. Over wifi, it does pretty much stink.
