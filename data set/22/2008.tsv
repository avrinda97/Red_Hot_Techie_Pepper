2011-06-28T12:56:00.000Z	morth		Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
2011-06-28T12:56:00.000Z	morth		installed software in a non-standard prefix.
2011-06-28T12:56:00.000Z	morth		Alternatively, you may set the environment variables OPENSSL_CFLAGS
2011-06-28T12:56:00.000Z	morth		and OPENSSL_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
2011-06-28T12:58:00.000Z	morth		could someone help? i'm trying to install rtorrent and im getting an error when i try to ./configre "http://paste.ubuntu.com/634097/"

2011-06-28T13:00:00.000Z	knoppies	morth	PLEASE, learn how to use a pastebin.
2011-06-28T13:03:00.000Z	knoppies	morth	ejv has a point. I have recently learnt that you should install the -dev of the package. try openssl-dev (or use apt-cache search openssl)
2011-06-28T13:04:00.000Z	morth	knoppies	& ejv E: Unable to locate package openssl-dev
2011-06-28T13:04:00.000Z	knoppies	morth	try  libglobus-openssl-dev
2011-06-28T13:05:00.000Z	morth	knoppies	that worked
2011-06-28T13:05:00.000Z	knoppies	morth	come back if it does not solve your ./configure problem.
2011-06-28T13:08:00.000Z	morth	knoppies	& ejv http://paste.ubuntu.com/634101/
2011-06-28T13:09:00.000Z	knoppies	morth	now you need to find the -dev of sigc++
2011-06-28T13:10:00.000Z	knoppies	morth	unless you HAVE to compile it, it might be easier to do apt-get install rtorrent
2011-06-28T13:13:00.000Z	knoppies	morth	do you HAVE to compile rtorrent from scratch? If yes, then try apt-get build-deps rtorrent
2011-06-28T13:14:00.000Z	morth	knoppies	stupid question but how do i KNOW if i HAVE to compile it or not?
2011-06-28T13:16:00.000Z	knoppies	morth	if you dont know, then you probably dont have to. Reasons for compiling (over just installing a pre-compiled binary) would be things like: newer version, or a plugin, or some functionality that they did not include in the compiled binary. I think you should try apt-get install rtorrent
