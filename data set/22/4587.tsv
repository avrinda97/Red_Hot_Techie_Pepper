2008-01-24T07:41:00.000Z	shrug		how the hell do you use fluxbox?
2008-01-24T07:42:00.000Z	shrug		it doesnt work them
2008-01-24T07:42:00.000Z	shrug		i right click all day long an nothing
2008-01-24T07:43:00.000Z	bazhang	shrug	you need to edit the flux configuration files
2008-01-24T07:43:00.000Z	bazhang	shrug	you should read up on the internet on how to edit those
2008-01-28T10:03:00.000Z	bazhang	shrug	you have two different ubuntu installs on the same machine
2008-01-28T10:03:00.000Z	shrug	bazhang	yes, one ubu-studio
2008-01-28T10:05:00.000Z	shrug	bazhang	i thought there was something that detects patitons and lets you mount them
2008-01-28T10:05:00.000Z	bazhang	shrug	which program--you can enable the ubuntustudio repos for gutsy and install it on gutsy side
2008-01-28T10:06:00.000Z	shrug	bazhang	i have vmware installed with windows on it, but i cant get x work for some reason, or GDM, so i just want to run it from this patition
2008-01-28T10:07:00.000Z	bazhang	shrug	you cant get it to work on ubuntustudio?
2008-01-28T10:07:00.000Z	shrug	bazhang	ubuntu studio wont load
2008-01-28T10:07:00.000Z	shrug	bazhang	blue screen of death type stuff going on
2008-01-28T10:07:00.000Z	bazhang	shrug	doesn't really answer my question though
2008-01-28T10:08:00.000Z	shrug	bazhang	 x doesnt work on ubuntu studio, for some reason unknown....
2008-01-28T10:09:00.000Z	bazhang	shrug	then install vmware-server on gutsy
2008-01-28T10:09:00.000Z	shrug	bazhang	so i need to run VBox from gutsy
2008-01-28T10:09:00.000Z	shrug	bazhang	i need this tonight, and i do not have a windows disc handy
2008-01-28T10:09:00.000Z	shrug	bazhang	temp fix
2008-01-28T10:09:00.000Z	shrug	bazhang	college homework
2008-01-28T10:10:00.000Z	bazhang	shrug	best to fix ubuntustudio problems--what you are proposing is way more difficult if even possible
