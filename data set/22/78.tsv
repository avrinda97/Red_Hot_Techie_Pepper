2012-10-23T07:29:00.000Z	py_can		hi I can't remove mysql-server with apt-get. It actually tries to install mysql-server when I do it and I get error messages: http://pastebin.com/LJMQvC4B
2012-10-23T07:30:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	py_can	it's not installed but it seems you tried to install it but it failed
2012-10-23T07:31:00.000Z	py_can	SolarisBoy	ok sec
2012-10-23T07:32:00.000Z	py_can	SolarisBoy	loads of errors. something is really messed up.
2012-10-23T07:33:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	py_can	the error appears to be in the text you posted.
2012-10-23T07:33:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	py_can	Fatal error: Can't change to run as user 'mysql' ;  Please check that the user  exists!
2012-10-23T07:33:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	py_can	from where is the source for that package you are installing? is it ubuntu standard repos?
2012-10-23T07:33:00.000Z	py_can	SolarisBoy	note: I'm trying to completly remove mysql
2012-10-23T07:33:00.000Z	py_can	SolarisBoy	yes
2012-10-23T07:33:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	py_can	i know
2012-10-23T07:34:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	py_can	but it failed to install initially it is 'queued'
2012-10-23T07:34:00.000Z	py_can	SolarisBoy	I see
2012-10-23T07:34:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	py_can	if you observe the message it says "mysql not installed so not removing" then it goes on to process the stuff it couldn't before
2012-10-23T07:35:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	py_can	can you do this dpkg -l '*mysql*'

2012-10-23T07:39:00.000Z	py_can	SolarisBoy	2 hours ago mysql was acting weird, couldnt grant priv. to a newly created user. So after a while i decided to reinstall mysql. And then apt-get remove went bonkers, i tried manually removing some directories and the mysql user, now it is royally messed up.
2012-10-23T07:40:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	py_can	so uninstall mysql-server-5.5
2012-10-23T07:41:00.000Z	py_can	SolarisBoy	looks clean now
2012-10-23T07:41:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	py_can	right - there are post and pre scripts that execute when packages are installed - doing steps manually before asking the apt system or others will generally mess up stuff - not badly but yea
2012-10-23T07:41:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	py_can	cool
2012-10-23T07:42:00.000Z	py_can	SolarisBoy	thx!
2012-10-23T07:42:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	py_can	sure
