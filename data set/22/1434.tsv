2012-08-07T06:43:00.000Z	TJ-	Jordan_U	Thanks for that... I did wonder... but its hard to explain how the device got GPTed in the first place to cause bonhoeffer this much aggro
2012-08-17T04:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TJ-	There's no easy way to tell which kernel belongs to which distribution, so if you use grub-mkconfig/update-grub (rather than writing your grub.cfg manually) you will get entries for example that have Ubuntu set to boot with one of your Debian kernels.
2012-08-17T04:08:00.000Z	TJ-	Jordan_U	I don't get that problem - but then again I've customised /etc/grub.d/
2012-09-08T02:57:00.000Z	TJ-	Jordan_U	otterpaw What is 'installed' is a pendrive image of the liveCD
2012-09-08T02:57:00.000Z	TJ-	Jordan_U	scratch that! My eyes scanned the info wrong!
2012-09-08T02:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TJ-	There is also an Ubuntu installation there, just no grub.
2012-09-08T02:57:00.000Z	TJ-	Jordan_U	I read the sdb as sda :p
2012-09-08T02:58:00.000Z	TJ-	Jordan_U	Maybe the BIOS has boot-sector protection enabled? That would prevent GRUB from updating the Windows MBR
2012-09-08T02:58:00.000Z	TJ-	Jordan_U	Everything else in sda5 looks good
2012-09-08T02:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TJ-	Many people have talked about BIOSs protecting the MBR, I've never encountered such a thing before though. I think that's most likely just a myth.
2012-09-08T02:59:00.000Z	TJ-	Jordan_U	I have!
2012-09-08T02:59:00.000Z	TJ-	Jordan_U	took me an hour to figure it out too.. so I remember it well :)
2012-09-08T03:01:00.000Z	TJ-	Jordan_U	otterpaw Anyhow, it looks like just the MBR. You could do a 2-stage fix. 1. do grub-setup from the pendrive just for the MBR, boot Ubuntu, then "update-grub" to pick up Windows. or 2. use the pendrive to set-up a chroot /target and do it in there
2012-09-08T03:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TJ-	The grub.cfg already has an entry for Windows, and it's better to run grub-install than to try to run grub-setup manually.
2012-09-08T03:03:00.000Z	TJ-	Jordan_U	So it does ... I obviously need sleep, I'm not seeing things right in front of me
2012-09-08T03:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TJ-	My recommendation is to simply run grub-install (following the directions I already linked otterpaw to) and see what happens. After running grub-install we can re-run boot info script to confirm that grub's boot sector is in the MBR.
2012-09-08T03:14:00.000Z	TJ-	Jordan_U	Interestingly, the people who've suffered this say the disk came with a GPT and the MBR is the standard defensive one
2012-09-08T03:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TJ-	That sounds like it's simply an issue of the drive looking for a UEFI loader, with Ubuntu only installing a BIOS based one. A: That's not what's happening here and B: That is not "Boot sector protection".
2012-09-08T03:16:00.000Z	TJ-	Jordan_U	Agreed.
2012-10-11T10:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TJ-	You have it a bit backwards, if the flag exists then the menu *is* shown. Also, grub writes the flag, and /etc/init.d/grub-common clears it.
2012-10-11T10:59:00.000Z	TJ-	Jordan_U	Actually no. I met the issue on a device recently. If the GRUB environment has never been written (because the device it is supposedly on is read-only) the GRUB menu would repeatedly show.
