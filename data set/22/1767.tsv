2011-03-26T11:05:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	nixjr	nvidia?
2011-03-26T11:05:00.000Z	nixjr	Seven_Six_Two	yes
2011-03-26T11:06:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	nixjr	there's a check box in nvidia-settings   but remember to run it as root so that it can write xorg.conf
2011-03-26T11:07:00.000Z	nixjr	Seven_Six_Two	in "twinview" there is a check box for primary, but i dont want 1 spanned desktop, i want separate ones, in "separate x session" there is not check box for primary
2011-03-26T11:09:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	nixjr	what do you suppose "primary" means with separate x screens?
2011-03-26T11:10:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	nixjr	really, with separate x screens, the only consideration is relative location.
2011-03-26T11:10:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	nixjr	or absolute, if you're into that kind of thing. ;)
2011-03-26T11:11:00.000Z	nixjr	Seven_Six_Two	i have 2 monitors, one connected with vga and one with dvi, on ym desk the dvi is tot he left and the vga to the right, when using "separate x session" the vga monitor ont he right is whjere my login prompt comes up, and the mouse spans from the right of the right monitor, into the left of the left monitor
2011-03-26T11:12:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	nixjr	drag and drop the monitor locations at the top of nvidia-setting?
2011-03-26T12:25:00.000Z	nixjr	Seven_Six_Two	i had to restart X to get my monitor changes to take effect, i didnt come back here afterwards cause its working correctly now, thanks for helping out
2011-03-26T12:25:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	nixjr	np!
2011-03-26T12:26:00.000Z	nixjr	Seven_Six_Two	i got a folow up question now though lol, when i right click an application on the taskbar theres a "move to another workstation" option, how can a move something to another X session?
2011-03-26T12:28:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	nixjr	well, I haven't done separate x screens, but I've looked into moving running processes, and the general consensus is that you can't do it for a variety of reasons. some of them being memory allocation done by the process when it started
2011-03-26T12:29:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	nixjr	because separate x screens means separate x sessions
2011-03-26T12:30:00.000Z	nixjr	Seven_Six_Two	you can probably tell im very new to ubuntu so thanks for just giving it to me a nutshell and not sending me down some complex path
2011-03-26T12:30:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	nixjr	that's what I read when I was trying to make dual head big desktop
2011-03-26T12:31:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	nixjr	feel free to search though, and if you figure out how to move a running process, tell me! I'd love to know
2011-03-26T12:32:00.000Z	nixjr	Seven_Six_Two	i managed to fix my own problem before by editing xorg.conf and swapping monitor0 and monitor1 around, that was scary enough, i dont think ill look too deeply into moving running processes
