2004-11-19T14:48:00.000Z	mirak		What should ubuntu become in the future ? Will ubuntu evolve and have config tools like mandrake ?
2004-11-19T14:48:00.000Z	mirak		I mean what is the real goal ?
2004-11-19T14:49:00.000Z	topyli	mirak	why would we what such a tool?
2004-11-19T14:50:00.000Z	topyli	mirak	still. we want things to Just Work, and whatever needs to be changed should be easy to change with specific tools
2004-11-19T14:51:00.000Z	topyli	mirak	yast is liberated now
2004-11-19T14:53:00.000Z	topyli	mirak	debian is for free software, like gpl stuff. are you hallucinating? ;)
2004-11-19T14:54:00.000Z	mirak	topyli	I promised me to read one day this licence stuffs :)
2004-11-19T14:56:00.000Z	topyli	mirak	the mandrake control center implementation is quite cool really. much better than yast.
2004-11-19T14:57:00.000Z	mirak	topyli	I don't know yast, I will google for it
2004-11-19T14:57:00.000Z	topyli	mirak	leave yast alone, it will misconfigure your girlfriend, and corrupt your dog =)
2004-11-19T15:04:00.000Z	mirak	topyli	"The Debian Project is now officially addressing its usability on the desktop with the launch of the Debian Desktop subproject.
2004-12-02T10:56:00.000Z	topyli	mirak	yes, ./configure --prefix=$HOME/lib or something
2004-12-05T14:57:00.000Z	topyli	mirak	microsoft does :)
2004-12-05T14:57:00.000Z	topyli	mirak	the marillat sources?
2004-12-05T14:58:00.000Z	mirak	topyli	ok so I have them, I though there was something else
2004-12-05T14:59:00.000Z	topyli	mirak	you want to rebuild, or why do you need it?
2004-12-05T15:02:00.000Z	mirak	topyli	I just need the codec
2004-12-05T15:04:00.000Z	topyli	mirak	you could try and extract the binary from the package. but i don't know
2004-12-05T15:07:00.000Z	topyli	mirak	study man dpkg and find out how to extract stuff from them. i've seen that in the documentation
2005-05-19T13:41:00.000Z	topyli	mirak	get a stable distribution? :)
2005-05-19T13:44:00.000Z	topyli	mirak	ubuntu's development versions are (at this point of the release cycle) much more unstable than debian unstable
