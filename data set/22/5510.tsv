2007-10-11T16:04:00.000Z	nickrud	haru	you'd have to show the entire error, that's not enough. Put it on a pastebin

2007-10-12T16:06:00.000Z	haru	nickrud	any ideas?
2007-10-12T16:06:00.000Z	nickrud	haru	that's really odd that an ubuntu repo would do that. Could be a corrupt download. You've tried more than once, I hope (not)?
2007-10-12T16:06:00.000Z	haru	nickrud	yes
2007-10-12T16:07:00.000Z	haru	nickrud	do u have any ideas where aptitude saves package.gz files it download
2007-10-12T16:07:00.000Z	nickrud	haru	security is the only one that does that? If so, it's probably a problem at the other end
2007-10-12T16:07:00.000Z	haru	nickrud	works fine on another system i have
2007-10-12T16:07:00.000Z	nickrud	haru	/var/lib/apt/lists
2007-10-12T16:09:00.000Z	haru	nickrud	see.. now deleting everything there fixes it
2007-10-12T16:09:00.000Z	nickrud	haru	I'll remember that, thanks for the update
2007-10-23T12:09:00.000Z	nickrud	haru	try searching for pages with Flash in the names on help.ubuntu.com/community , there are some troubleshooting pages ghere
2007-10-23T12:10:00.000Z	haru	nickrud	trying that :)
2007-10-23T12:12:00.000Z	haru	nickrud	btw know the fix for no usplash on boot ?
2007-10-23T12:12:00.000Z	nickrud	haru	I turned off usplash, I really like the scrolling kernel messages (not, fglrx breaks consoles with framebuffers)
2007-10-23T12:24:00.000Z	haru	nickrud	only by installed size , not by installer size :)
2007-10-23T12:26:00.000Z	nickrud	haru	actually, it has installed size and size, could probably format the output and pipe it through sort.
2007-10-23T12:27:00.000Z	haru	nickrud	it does o.O
2007-10-23T12:30:00.000Z	haru	nickrud	i tried alsa, oss and aoss for firefoxrc [flash] :( still no sounds.. any ideas?
2007-10-23T12:30:00.000Z	nickrud	haru	no, I've been very lucky with linux and sound. Never had any problems
