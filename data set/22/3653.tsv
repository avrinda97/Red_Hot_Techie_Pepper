2008-07-10T05:14:00.000Z	rvtcadmin		nubbie, i'm afraid i thought i copied and pasted the command.. but, i didn't.  sudo apt -get ubuntu desktop?
2008-07-10T05:16:00.000Z	rvtcadmin		ugg, i feel silly.  i just asked this question but didn't copy the command properly.  friend's laptop is running xubuntu, can't log into gnome (says it
2008-07-10T05:17:00.000Z	rvtcadmin		s not installed), need to get it?
2008-07-10T05:17:00.000Z	rvtcadmin		but how
2008-07-10T05:18:00.000Z	bloodrock	rvtcadmin	sudo apt-get ubuntu-desktop
2008-07-10T05:18:00.000Z	bloodrock	rvtcadmin	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2008-07-10T05:27:00.000Z	bloodrock	rvtcadmin	check at the login screen under options>sessions see if gnome is listed
2008-07-10T05:29:00.000Z	rvtcadmin	bloodrock	it was listed, but when i tried to switch to it it said it was not installed
2008-07-10T05:30:00.000Z	rvtcadmin	bloodrock	is installing presently
2008-07-10T05:31:00.000Z	bloodrock	rvtcadmin	k try sudo apt-get install gnome2.22.2 least i think thats correct
2008-07-10T05:31:00.000Z	rvtcadmin	bloodrock	for better or for worse i already tried sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2008-07-10T05:32:00.000Z	bloodrock	rvtcadmin	was being used for desktop envi
2008-07-10T05:33:00.000Z	rvtcadmin	bloodrock	xfce/xubuntu was being used
2008-07-10T05:33:00.000Z	bloodrock	rvtcadmin	 oh
2008-07-10T05:33:00.000Z	bloodrock	rvtcadmin	 was gnome ever on it
2008-07-10T05:34:00.000Z	rvtcadmin	bloodrock	apparently, i found gnome files under /share
2008-07-10T05:34:00.000Z	rvtcadmin	bloodrock	though maybe those could just be old preference files?
2008-07-10T05:35:00.000Z	bloodrock	rvtcadmin	they do use some gnome stuff on xubuntu
2008-07-10T05:35:00.000Z	rvtcadmin	bloodrock	ah, i see.
2008-07-10T05:38:00.000Z	rvtcadmin	bloodrock	i don't know, I can't use synaptic now because apt-get is installing ubuntu desktop
2008-07-10T05:39:00.000Z	bloodrock	rvtcadmin	oh ok then it prob installing gnome
2008-07-10T05:39:00.000Z	rvtcadmin	bloodrock	yeah, i'll just wait and see what happens
