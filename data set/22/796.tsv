2011-09-30T18:18:00.000Z	Abhijit_		hi.how to make mobile phone memory card mount as read/write. it is mounting default as read oonly. help!!!
2011-09-30T18:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	Abhijit_	 try accessing it as root.. see if root can write to it. if so. you can make a fstab entry, or install/run ntfs-config to make it accessable by all users.
2011-09-30T18:19:00.000Z	Abhijit_	dr_willis	tried with root. no luck.
2011-09-30T18:19:00.000Z	Abhijit_	dr_willis	tried with sudo mount -o remount, rw '/media/1234-5678/' still no luck
2011-09-30T18:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	Abhijit_	 so its mounted but not writeable but is readable? check dmesg output for any error messages perhaps.
2011-09-30T18:20:00.000Z	Abhijit_	dr_willis	shoud i pastebin the dmsg output?
2011-09-30T18:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	Abhijit_	 just try to write to it as  the root user. not remounting it. :)
2011-09-30T18:20:00.000Z	Abhijit_	dr_willis	tired to write to it using root using cp. no luck.
2011-09-30T18:21:00.000Z	Abhijit_	dr_willis	will touch work for folder?
2011-09-30T18:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	Abhijit_	 touch sets the date, or creates a file  normally.  its just a simple test.
2011-09-30T18:22:00.000Z	Abhijit_	dr_willis	the command sudo touch testfile just worked. but no output seen.
2011-09-30T18:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	Abhijit_	 so somtign is odd.. you made a file. AN empty one.. :) but still a file
2011-09-30T18:24:00.000Z	Abhijit_	dr_willis	okies. but how can we solve this?
2011-09-30T18:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	Abhijit_	 does cp give some error? or just says read only? if the thing is having read/write errors. it may become read-only to prevent damage.
2011-09-30T18:26:00.000Z	Abhijit_	dr_willis	when i treid to sudo cp some time ago it gave error but just now i tried again and now its just hanging there
2011-09-30T18:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	Abhijit_	 ch4eck 'dmesg' output now.
2011-09-30T18:26:00.000Z	Abhijit_	dr_willis	wait i think its worked
2011-09-30T18:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	Abhijit_	 there may be some hardware issues going on.
2011-09-30T18:27:00.000Z	Abhijit_	dr_willis	yes. it worked. the files copied successfully. any guess what can cause this? becuase hardware is mobile phone which is working fine. and this same issue happen with my mobile too sometimes. then othertimes it dont happen.
2011-09-30T18:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	Abhijit_	 hard to tell. cable loose?
2011-09-30T18:30:00.000Z	Abhijit_	dr_willis	no! cable is not loose! :-) anyway the issue is solved for the timebeing. thanks! :-)
2011-09-30T18:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	Abhijit_	 dog chewed on it.
