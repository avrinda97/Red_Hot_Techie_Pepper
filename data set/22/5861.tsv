2007-02-07T09:17:00.000Z	GoopyMonkey		can someone help me withrecuding partition side?
2007-02-07T09:17:00.000Z	GoopyMonkey		* with reducing
2007-02-07T09:17:00.000Z	frogzoo	GoopyMonkey	run gparted from a live disk
2007-02-07T09:18:00.000Z	frogzoo	GoopyMonkey	that works for all partitions but ntfs
2007-02-07T09:19:00.000Z	GoopyMonkey	frogzoo	uh-oh, I have an NTFS drive
2007-02-07T09:19:00.000Z	frogzoo	GoopyMonkey	then it's imperative you backup before proceeding
2007-02-07T09:20:00.000Z	GoopyMonkey	frogzoo	my guess is that I need to reformat my hard drive to FAT?
2007-02-07T09:21:00.000Z	frogzoo	GoopyMonkey	tbh ntfs is a better file system than fat, only gparted 1.0 is bugged. if you can find a bootable cd with gparted 2.0 use that
2007-02-07T09:22:00.000Z	GoopyMonkey	frogzoo	So I can reduce partition size from a LiveCD as long as it has gparted 2.0?
2007-02-07T09:24:00.000Z	frogzoo	GoopyMonkey	my bad - gparted 0.2 - but ubuntu uses 0.1 so you'll need something else
2007-02-07T09:24:00.000Z	frogzoo	GoopyMonkey	it sounds clumsy, but you might have better luck with an ubuntu cd, and the latest gparted on usb, that might be possible
2007-02-07T09:25:00.000Z	GoopyMonkey	frogzoo	But what's the difference between a liveCD and a Ubuntu CD?
2007-02-07T09:26:00.000Z	frogzoo	GoopyMonkey	some ubuntu cds will run ubuntu when they're booted
2007-02-07T09:27:00.000Z	GoopyMonkey	frogzoo	So, from what I've gathered, I need to put gparted 0.2 onto a USB flash drive, then boot Ubuntu using a Ubuntu CD, not a liveCD. Right?
2007-02-07T09:28:00.000Z	frogzoo	GoopyMonkey	the edgy cd will work as a live cd
2007-02-07T09:28:00.000Z	GoopyMonkey	frogzoo	ah, thanks. So gparted .02 on flash drive, boot ubuntu from edgy cd then reduce partition size?
2007-02-07T09:29:00.000Z	GoopyMonkey	frogzoo	oops, 0.2
2007-02-07T09:29:00.000Z	frogzoo	GoopyMonkey	that's safest, but if you value your data, you'll backup first
2007-02-07T09:46:00.000Z	GoopyMonkey	frogzoo	OK, thanks, I'e had a look around at things, but will I need to boot ubuntu from the CD to actually use gparted?
2007-02-07T09:46:00.000Z	GoopyMonkey	frogzoo	sorry, *I've
2007-02-07T09:46:00.000Z	frogzoo	GoopyMonkey	that sounds like a good approach, but still backup any data you can't replace
2007-02-07T09:47:00.000Z	GoopyMonkey	frogzoo	OK, I'll back up my sisters MP3's and my flash 8 things :)
