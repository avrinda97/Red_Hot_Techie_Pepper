2007-06-24T12:41:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	Flannel	is there a better irc client for command line
2007-06-24T12:41:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaCenti	the other is bitchx.  Although personally I prefer irssi.
2007-06-24T12:42:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	Flannel	Thanks :) I will try both to see which I like. much appreciated Flannel for all your help over the last few weeks :)
2007-06-29T14:56:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaCenti	console-tools is probably the easiest route
2007-06-29T14:56:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	Flannel	just type that in as a command?
2007-06-29T14:56:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaCenti	it's a package.  Probably has a command that's similar, but I don't know for sure.
2007-06-29T14:57:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	Flannel	hmmm.
2007-06-29T14:57:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaCenti	http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?searchmode=filelist&word=console-tools&version=feisty&arch=i386  seems to be a suite of utilities
2007-06-29T15:10:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaCenti	you probably want a vga option on the kernel for that. add `vga=ask` and then after you've figured out what option you want, go back and make that permanant
2007-06-29T15:23:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaCenti	DONT uncomment it.  (go back and recomment it)
2007-06-29T15:23:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	Flannel	okay
2007-06-29T15:23:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	Flannel	going back and uncommenting
2007-06-29T15:24:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaCenti	No.  DONT unomment.  re-comment.  Put a # infront of the kopt
2007-06-29T15:25:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	Flannel	didn't know if that was sensitive information or not, so sent as pm
2007-06-29T10:18:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	Flannel	I checked out screen, pretty interesting.
2007-06-29T10:18:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	Flannel	I am really still having problems with the console fonts/resolutions... I hate having nonstandard resolutions
2007-06-29T10:20:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	Flannel	Did you like TLD?
2007-06-30T05:46:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	Flannel	did you try tdl?
2007-06-30T05:46:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	Flannel	could I get that hardline again? I didn't see anything in the guide about that
2007-06-30T05:47:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaCenti	not yet, haven't had time.  But read up about it.  Looks handy
2007-06-30T05:47:00.000Z	Flannel	OmegaCenti	in ~/.screenrc : hardstatus alwayslastline "%{wb}[ %?%-Lw%?%{bw} %n*%f %t %{wb}%?%+Lw%? ] %= %{wb}[ %m/%d %c ] "
2007-06-30T05:49:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	Flannel	WOW, that hardline rocks
