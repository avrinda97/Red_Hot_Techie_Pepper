2010-09-10T17:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		 cptblod  you have checked the forums? also you may want to state what your exact video chipset is - to see if anyone else n the hcannel has used that chipset.
2010-09-10T17:12:00.000Z	cptblod	Dr_Willis	no, im checking here as i want help directly :) it's an nvidia 9400gt card
2010-09-10T17:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cptblod	 its also possible its how its detecting your monitor thats the issue. not the video card. Are you using VGA/DVI? what sort of connection?
2010-09-10T17:14:00.000Z	cptblod	Dr_Willis	im using VGA->DVI atm
2010-09-10T17:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cptblod	 Try it without an adaptor if you can figure out how.
2010-09-10T17:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cptblod	 ive see all sorts of odd quirks with those adaptors
2010-09-10T17:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cptblod	 can you run the 'nvidia-settings' tool ?
2010-09-10T17:21:00.000Z	cptblod	Dr_Willis	yes
2010-09-14T17:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cptblod	 nvidia and plymouth like to fight with each other
2010-09-14T17:45:00.000Z	cptblod	Dr_Willis	that's bad :( looks like shit atm
2010-09-14T17:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cptblod	 never noticed or tried... it boots so fast. i rarely see it
2010-09-14T17:52:00.000Z	cptblod	Dr_Willis	/ BluesKaj: i tried installing nvidia-96 drivers, but the system says they are activated, but not in use? how to fix that?
2010-09-14T17:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cptblod	 can you run 'nvidia-settings' ?
2010-09-14T17:53:00.000Z	cptblod	Dr_Willis	will try after this reboot
2010-09-14T17:54:00.000Z	cptblod	Dr_Willis	nvidia-settings says im not using the NVIDIA X driver
2010-09-14T18:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cptblod	 plymouth is not a good test one way or the other.. :)
2010-09-14T18:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cptblod	 do you have an old xorg.conf still in /etc/X11/ ?
2010-09-14T18:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cptblod	  look in /etc/X11 for a xorg.conf file :)
2010-09-14T18:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cptblod	 the little hardware-drivers tool works for my 3 nvidia machines.
2010-09-14T18:10:00.000Z	cptblod	Dr_Willis	mm, doesnt enable vdpau here at least, hence why i try to get new drivers... also removed nouveau driver
2010-09-14T18:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cptblod	 vdpau is a bit of a new cutting edge thing. :) I only recently got a card that even supports it.
2010-09-14T18:38:00.000Z	cptblod	Dr_Willis	so what can i do, nvidia-xconfig doesnt exist, i must be missin somethin?
