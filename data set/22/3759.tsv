2008-06-06T05:12:00.000Z	wers		i want to reduce cpu usage. will xubuntu be a good idea?
2008-06-06T05:12:00.000Z	peitschie	wers	what are you specs?
2008-06-06T05:13:00.000Z	wers	peitschie	1.5ghz celeron m
2008-06-06T05:14:00.000Z	wers	peitschie	actually, i'm fine with gnome but i always run virtualbox. at some point, I have to sacrifice firefox or virtualbox for my system to run smoothly
2008-06-06T05:14:00.000Z	peitschie	wers	ahh.  Well, virtualbox needs more ram.  How much ram do you have?
2008-06-06T05:15:00.000Z	wers	peitschie	512 mb
2008-06-06T05:15:00.000Z	peitschie	wers	I have the same issue running it on my laptop.  As soon as I start running virtualbox it sucks up all my system memory
2008-06-06T05:15:00.000Z	peitschie	wers	wow!  thats evil lol.  For virtualisation stuff you want at least 1.5Gb I reckon... I have issues on 1Gb
2008-06-06T05:15:00.000Z	wers		actually, everything is smooth if I just dont run firefox and vbox together
2008-06-06T05:16:00.000Z	wers	peitschie	i'm running some lite xp ;)
2008-06-06T05:16:00.000Z	peitschie	wers	yes.  That is because firefox uses up a couple hundred megabytes of ram :-)
2008-06-06T05:16:00.000Z	wers		yeah but that's not the issue on fx3
2008-06-06T05:16:00.000Z	wers		if only swap can fix this
2008-06-06T05:16:00.000Z	peitschie	wers	you can try xubuntu, i'd recommend fluxbuntu personally... but yer... I am not sure if that would make enough difference in ram.  I'd recommend getting a least 1Gb of ram :)
2008-06-06T05:17:00.000Z	peitschie	wers	a lighter windows manager such as xubuntu would help.... but you're still squeezing to fit all that stuff in memory
2008-06-06T05:17:00.000Z	wers	peitschie	yeah. i dont want fluxbuntu because i dont believe in the quality of those derivatives. hehe
2008-06-06T05:17:00.000Z	peitschie	wers	xubuntu is also a derivative ;)
2008-06-06T05:18:00.000Z	wers	peitschie	it's an official one and much more people work on it
2008-06-06T05:18:00.000Z	peitschie	wers	well... yes there definitely is that :)
2008-06-06T05:18:00.000Z	wers		yeah. i'll see if there's a ram usage difference. i'll buy more ram as soon as resources permit peitschie
2008-06-06T05:20:00.000Z	peitschie	wers	good luck :-).  If you're ever interested, have a look at ram and swap usage when running virtual box.  As soon as it starts eating into swap, things always slow down really bad for me :)
2008-06-06T05:20:00.000Z	wers	peitschie	been doing that. you're right. though i've been eating 100%cpu at some point, the real issue is ram
