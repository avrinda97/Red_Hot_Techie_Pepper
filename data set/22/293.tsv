2012-01-20T08:26:00.000Z	Zaukox		im not even able to use fsck! :(
2012-01-20T08:26:00.000Z	Zaukox		really, im not able to get any soft check and fix /dev/sda!!
2012-01-20T08:26:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	why can't you fsck
2012-01-20T08:27:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	you need to have the partition not mounted in order to check it
2012-01-20T08:29:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	pastebin the following: "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda" and "mount"
2012-01-20T08:31:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	pastebin the following: "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda" and "mount"
2012-01-20T08:32:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	to see the partitions
2012-01-20T08:35:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	i think you mean you forgot fdisk
2012-01-20T08:36:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	"fdisk -l /dev/sda" shows nothing?
2012-01-20T08:37:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	fsck won't check/fix NTFS partitions
2012-01-20T08:37:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	you can use fsck on /dev/sda2 though
2012-01-20T08:38:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	you don't, you have to use windows
2012-01-20T08:38:00.000Z	Zaukox	Ben64	i cannot boot any OS :(
2012-01-20T08:39:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	try fsck on /dev/sda2 then
2012-01-20T08:41:00.000Z	Zaukox	Ben64	wat the cmd for the sda2 check+fix?
2012-01-20T08:42:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	"sudo fsck -y /dev/sda2"
2012-01-20T08:47:00.000Z	Zaukox	Ben64	hmm, i wonder how long it will take -.-
2012-01-20T09:03:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	the easiest thing to do would be to format and reinstall, but the hard drive errors will still exist
2012-01-20T09:25:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	it is impossible to fix the hard drive
2012-01-20T09:31:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	because it is physically bad
2012-01-20T09:32:00.000Z	Zaukox	Ben64	and low format will fix that or not?
2012-01-20T09:33:00.000Z	Ben64	Zaukox	thats already been answered many many times, no.
