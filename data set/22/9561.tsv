2007-06-14T10:49:00.000Z	baconbits		Hello
2007-06-14T10:51:00.000Z	baconbits		Can someone possibly help a ubuntu newb?
2007-06-14T10:51:00.000Z	baconbits		OK I don't know anything about linux, basically
2007-06-14T10:51:00.000Z	baconbits		A friend was helping me install ubuntu
2007-06-14T10:52:00.000Z	baconbits		and I don't have any CDs (I'm on vacation) so he had me use wubi to install it
2007-06-14T10:52:00.000Z	baconbits		I rebooted and ran ubuntu and it went through the install and then had issues with my X server (Which is apparently GUI)
2007-06-14T10:53:00.000Z	baconbits		Because I have an ATI graphics card, according to my friend
2007-06-14T10:53:00.000Z	baconbits		He said he knows how to get the proper drivers if I had a wired internet connection
2007-06-14T10:53:00.000Z	baconbits		But I'm using my grandparents' neighbors' wifi so I don't have a wired connection
2007-06-14T10:54:00.000Z	tritium	baconbits	ati drivers are supplied on the install CD.  You don't _need_ the proprietary ones for it to work
2007-06-14T10:57:00.000Z	tritium	baconbits	yes, it's a dialog (like a wizard, but text-based)
2007-06-14T11:56:00.000Z	tritium	baconbits	why are you trying vesa?  Did you try the open "ati" driver?  (not fglrx)
2007-06-14T11:57:00.000Z	tritium	baconbits	I'm asking about your video driver
2007-06-14T11:59:00.000Z	tritium	baconbits	you should try "ati" and "radeon" before vesa
2007-06-14T12:04:00.000Z	tritium	baconbits	if you need to transfer it on a usb stick or similar due to not having internet access, get it off of packages.ubuntu.com
2007-06-14T12:06:00.000Z	tritium	baconbits	http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/misc/xorg-driver-fglrx
2007-06-14T12:08:00.000Z	tritium	baconbits	sudo dpkg -i </path/to/foo.deb>
2007-06-14T12:10:00.000Z	tritium	baconbits	see what I told you above.  The path should be somewhere under /media
2007-06-14T12:12:00.000Z	tritium	baconbits	it depends on your usb stick, but it should show up under /media after you plug it in
2007-06-14T12:12:00.000Z	tritium	baconbits	with the "cd" command
2007-06-14T12:13:00.000Z	tritium	baconbits	I guess
2007-06-14T12:17:00.000Z	tritium	baconbits	I'm goign to bed also
