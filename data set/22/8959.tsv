2005-04-20T10:39:00.000Z	memnoc		anyone know about my problem with Mplayer?
2005-04-20T10:39:00.000Z	memnoc		i have a weird problem with Mplayer.. all the menus and preferences have this old, ugly as hell look.. take a look: http://memmnoc.swifthost.net/pics/Screenshot.png now, what is it and how can i fix it?
2005-04-20T10:41:00.000Z	linux_galore	memnoc	mplayer has its own theme setup just either change theme or download one
2005-04-20T10:42:00.000Z	linux_galore	memnoc	PClinuxOS has lots of stuff pre themed or default to a nice theme
2005-04-20T10:42:00.000Z	memnoc	linux_galore	i'm guessing that's right, but how can i get Mplayer to have a GTK2 interface then?
2005-04-20T10:43:00.000Z	linux_galore	memnoc	right click on the mplayer window then click on skin browser.
2005-04-20T10:43:00.000Z	memnoc	linux_galore	i have installed new themes, but the menus look the same.
2005-04-20T10:43:00.000Z	linux_galore	memnoc	my rig looks nothing like your either
2005-04-20T10:44:00.000Z	linux_galore	memnoc	its using your gtk theme setup.....man thats one ugly gnome theme
2005-04-20T10:45:00.000Z	memnoc	linux_galore	hehe i'm guessing that's right.. but where can i change it?
2005-04-20T10:46:00.000Z	linux_galore	memnoc	you can change ubuntu's themes in the second drop down system menu
2005-04-20T10:46:00.000Z	linux_galore	memnoc	nothing to do with the install you just have an ugly gnome theme
2005-04-20T10:46:00.000Z	memnoc	linux_galore	Gorilla? that's not it..
2005-04-20T10:47:00.000Z	linux_galore	memnoc	yeah thats gorilla also edit the fonts use smaller ones
2005-04-20T10:48:00.000Z	memnoc	linux_galore	could it be because i installed mplayer-k6 (a Duron/Athlon version)?
2005-04-20T10:48:00.000Z	linux_galore	memnoc	no
2005-04-20T10:49:00.000Z	linux_galore	memnoc	I actually built my own version of mplayer because i wanted to hack in some extra codecs not supported by default the new version has really nice menu's compared to the last release
2005-04-20T10:49:00.000Z	memnoc	linux_galore	it can't be the theme.. every other app looks normal, the problem is specifically with Mplayer..
2005-04-20T10:52:00.000Z	linux_galore	memnoc	look in ~/.mplayer/gui.conf  file you can edit the defaults
2005-04-20T10:52:00.000Z	linux_galore	memnoc	the settings are in plain english text very easy to edit
2005-04-20T10:53:00.000Z	memnoc	linux_galore	thanks, i'll look into it.. :)
2005-04-20T10:54:00.000Z	linux_galore	memnoc	you can also just flush ~/.mplayer/  ie rm -rf ~/.mplayer/  see if that fixes it
