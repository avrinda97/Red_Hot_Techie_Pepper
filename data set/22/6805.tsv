2007-01-09T09:28:00.000Z	Camden		What's the best way to get a .wmv video onto a DVD?
2007-01-09T09:29:00.000Z	Camden		right now I have a very convoluted solution
2007-01-09T09:29:00.000Z	Camden		through .avi
2007-01-09T09:29:00.000Z	Camden		which takes lots of disk space during the process
2007-01-09T09:29:00.000Z	Camden		i do mencoder to get the avi
2007-01-09T09:30:00.000Z	Camden		then i use kino to edit and gen. the mpeg
2007-01-09T09:30:00.000Z	Camden		then dvdauth
2007-01-09T09:30:00.000Z	Camden		never tried it
2007-01-09T09:30:00.000Z	Camden		is it like kino?
2007-01-09T09:30:00.000Z	cafuego	Camden	Can't you just use ffmpeg and go from wmv->vob?
2007-01-09T09:31:00.000Z	cafuego	Camden	VOB is MPEg2 for DVD
2007-01-09T09:33:00.000Z	cafuego	Camden	yeah. I'm pretty sure ffmpeg can do what you want, anyway.
2007-01-09T09:33:00.000Z	Camden	cafuego	do you know the cmd line?
2007-01-09T09:37:00.000Z	cafuego	Camden	Try this: ffmpeg -i <input file> -target pal-dvd (or ntsc-dvd) -f vob outputfile.vob
2007-01-09T09:38:00.000Z	Camden	cafuego	thanks!
2007-01-09T09:38:00.000Z	cafuego	Camden	On my machine that generates a 6Mbps MPEG2 video stream with 448Kbps 4800KHz AAC audio
2007-01-09T09:38:00.000Z	Camden	cafuego	what would i do next after getting the vob?
2007-01-09T09:39:00.000Z	cafuego	Camden	to the best of my knowledge, they go in a VIDEO_TS directory on a DVD
2007-01-09T09:39:00.000Z	cafuego	Camden	Whatever you normally use to create DVDs,should be able to use VOB files as raw input.
2007-01-09T09:40:00.000Z	Camden	cafuego	so i could run dvdauthor on the vob file?
2007-01-09T09:40:00.000Z	cafuego	Camden	I've never sued dvdauthor, so I can't tell you.
2007-01-09T09:53:00.000Z	cafuego	Camden	yay
