2007-04-21T08:37:00.000Z	hrp2171		whats up, nvidia-settings question: I've enabled twinview with nvidia-xconfig --twinview but when i run nvidia-settings from terminal, I don't get an option to tweak twinview with the gui.
2007-04-21T08:37:00.000Z	crdlb	hrp2171	what version of the nvidia drivers?
2007-04-21T08:37:00.000Z	hrp2171	crdlb	im using what the ubuntu repos gave me.  should i be using nvidia's direct download instead?
2007-04-21T08:38:00.000Z	crdlb	hrp2171	on feisty?
2007-04-21T08:38:00.000Z	hrp2171		dapper
2007-04-21T08:38:00.000Z	crdlb	hrp2171	you need at least version 9xxx to configure twinview with nvidia-settings
2007-04-21T08:39:00.000Z	crdlb	hrp2171	what card?
2007-04-21T08:39:00.000Z	hrp2171	crdlb	yeah i think the dapper repos only have the 87xx
2007-04-21T08:39:00.000Z	hrp2171		geforece 7600gs
2007-04-21T08:39:00.000Z	hrp2171		pci-x
2007-04-21T08:39:00.000Z	crdlb	hrp2171	you can use the "latest driver" repository here: http://albertomilone.com/driver.html
2007-04-21T08:47:00.000Z	hrp2171	crdlb	thanks.  but im concerned about something.  i had installed a 686 kernel image and that repo is having me redownload  386 image again.  hopefully i can remove the 386 image after installing the newer nvidia binary.
2007-04-21T08:48:00.000Z	crdlb	hrp2171	I don't think that repo has restricted modules for 686
2007-04-21T08:48:00.000Z	hrp2171	crdlb	yikes!
2007-04-21T08:48:00.000Z	crdlb	hrp2171	I'll check, I never use it for dapper
2007-04-21T08:50:00.000Z	crdlb	hrp2171	it looks like it does
2007-04-21T08:50:00.000Z	crdlb	hrp2171	did it install some version of linux-restricted-modules-686 ?
2007-04-21T08:50:00.000Z	hrp2171	crdlb	nope the 386 version only.  though i already had the 686 version of those modules
2007-04-21T08:51:00.000Z	crdlb	hrp2171	but you need the newer version, try a sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2007-04-21T08:52:00.000Z	hrp2171	crdlb	the orange updater icon was already lit, opened it and the option to update the 686 modules was there.  downloading as we chat.
2007-04-21T08:53:00.000Z	hrp2171	crdlb	gonna restart.  thanks for your assistance.
