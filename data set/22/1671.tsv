2010-05-24T15:39:00.000Z	madjoe		Wha vncviewer should I use form my Karmic?
2010-05-24T15:39:00.000Z	madjoe		I tried to find vncviewer in my Synaptic, but there's no entry with that title.
2010-05-24T15:40:00.000Z	leagris	madjoe	If I remember it is called some remote/shared desktop and is integrated in KDE somehow.
2010-05-24T15:41:00.000Z	madjoe	leagris	does it mean I don't actually need an app like vnc4server?
2010-05-24T15:41:00.000Z	madjoe	leagris	gnomefreak: I followed this tutorial: http://nuclear-imaging.info/site_content/2009/07/03/getting-vnc-to-work-in-ubuntu-karmic-koala/
2010-05-24T15:43:00.000Z	leagris	madjoe	something like this: http://docs.kde.org/development/en/kdenetwork/krdc/using-krdc.html
2010-05-24T15:43:00.000Z	madjoe	leagris	Applications > Internet > Remote Desktop Viewer
2010-05-24T15:45:00.000Z	leagris	madjoe	if you intend on remoting ubuntu boxes your best bet is with freenx/nxdestop (free from nomachine). Nxdesktop has very great performance lightyears ahead of VNC performance wise.
2010-05-24T15:47:00.000Z	leagris	madjoe	and if you intend on remoting to Windows hosts, nothing beat tsclient to connect terminal server service.
2010-05-24T15:47:00.000Z	madjoe	leagris	thanks for the info.. do you have a tutorial for that? I'd like to make it more secure.. by SSH and tunneling if neccessary
2010-05-24T15:47:00.000Z	leagris	madjoe	nxdesktop actually uses ssh for tunneling. This is a click and go setup, quite easy.
2010-05-24T15:48:00.000Z	madjoe	leagris	exactly what I needed!
2010-05-24T15:48:00.000Z	madjoe	leagris	tsclient is just a viewer for Nxdesktop, or?
2010-05-24T15:50:00.000Z	leagris	madjoe	tsclient is a client for Windows terminal server
2010-05-24T15:51:00.000Z	madjoe	leagris	ok, so it should be doable to use remote desktop from Windows to Ubuntu and vice versa...
2010-05-24T15:51:00.000Z	leagris	madjoe	as for nxserver nxnode nxclient (or qtnx) here it is: http://www.nomachine.com/download.php
2010-05-24T15:53:00.000Z	madjoe	leagris	thanks! so I should choose this NX Free Edition for Linux, I guess
2010-05-24T15:53:00.000Z	leagris	madjoe	yes, remote desktop is doable boths ways. If you remote to windows machine from linux using tsclient->terminalserver you should really tunnel yourself using SSH as the terminal server protocol is bare vulnerable and should not be opened to the wide internet.
2010-05-24T15:54:00.000Z	madjoe	leagris	you said it uses tunneling automatically? am I right?
2010-05-24T15:55:00.000Z	leagris	madjoe	nxclient->nxserver automatically has an ssh tunnel. This is not the case of tsclient->terminalserver
2010-05-24T15:55:00.000Z	madjoe	leagris	cool, thanks!
2010-05-24T16:28:00.000Z	madjoe	leagris	I've found the most simplest way to do it! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwCQeNXr7Eg
