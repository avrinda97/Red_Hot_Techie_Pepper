2007-10-20T20:49:00.000Z	Joanki		it's like that for ALL of my programs

2007-10-20T20:50:00.000Z	kjm	Joanki	- your screen resolution is non optimal, reconfigure x
2007-10-20T20:50:00.000Z	Joanki		it is optimal, i just checked
2007-10-20T20:51:00.000Z	Joanki		i want the icons to be smaller - in my windows, they were very petite
2007-10-20T20:51:00.000Z	kjm	Joanki	- what is your screen resolution?
2007-10-20T20:52:00.000Z	Joanki		1280 x 800
2007-10-20T20:53:00.000Z	Joanki	kjm	: 1280 x 800
2007-10-20T20:53:00.000Z	Joanki		the problem is that the menu bar and icons are like two inches big in evolution
2007-10-20T20:53:00.000Z	Joanki		one inch in firefox
2007-10-20T20:53:00.000Z	kjm	Joanki	- what is the dpi setting?  Increasing the dpi may help.

2007-10-20T20:53:00.000Z	Joanki		how do i find out dpi setting?
2007-10-20T20:53:00.000Z	Joanki		the only real problem is the size of the icon bar to be honest
2007-10-20T20:53:00.000Z	Joanki		menu bar
2007-10-20T20:53:00.000Z	kjm	Joanki	- by reconfiguring x
