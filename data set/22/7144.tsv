2006-06-23T08:25:00.000Z	SurfnKid	siriusnova	what kind of system configuration you got
2006-06-23T08:26:00.000Z	siriusnova	SurfnKid	- IBM Thinkpad T30, 1.8 ghz P4-M with 1gb ram and a Radeon Mobility 7500 using the "radeon" x.org driver
2006-06-23T08:27:00.000Z	SurfnKid	siriusnova	wow very nice. im close to your config 1.7centrino Dell 8600, 1gb ram 9600ATI M10 128mb card, but i have to get my wifi going and the ati before i can get xgl
2006-06-23T08:27:00.000Z	siriusnova	SurfnKid	- XGL/AIGLX is slick
2006-06-23T08:27:00.000Z	SurfnKid	siriusnova	sweet, do you recommend using aiglx instead of compiz
2006-06-23T08:28:00.000Z	siriusnova	SurfnKid	- compiz you use both on XGL and AIGLX, you have to chooise either between XGL or AIGLX depending on wether you use ATI/Nvidia proprietary drivers or not
2006-06-23T08:31:00.000Z	SurfnKid	siriusnova	well congrats again! I hope i can get mine going again

2006-06-23T08:32:00.000Z	SurfnKid	siriusnova	yeah, i just have so much trouble with the wifi on dapper so there's no point on having xgl unless i can go wifi. so itll take me sometime
2006-06-23T08:34:00.000Z	SurfnKid	siriusnova	yeah i just have to follow the instructions, Ive got a good system just a matter of sitting there and messin with it
