2008-08-20T06:38:00.000Z	Flannel	mcw	Don't use automatix.  Do not.
2008-08-20T06:38:00.000Z	Flannel	mcw	Automatix isn't supported, and it's not needed either. there's nothing that it will help you with.
2008-08-20T06:39:00.000Z	Flannel	mcw	(isn't supported means we don't support it, and neither do the people who wrote it)
2008-08-20T06:39:00.000Z	Flannel	mcw	Explain what?
2008-08-20T06:40:00.000Z	Flannel	mcw	You should perhaps answer the questions you were asked.
2008-08-20T06:41:00.000Z	Flannel	mcw	Explain how what work?
2008-08-20T06:41:00.000Z	Flannel	mcw	Sure, that's not in the scope of this channel, but come to #ubuntu-offtopic and I'll explain
2008-08-20T06:42:00.000Z	Flannel	mcw	Read that page, it explains everything you need to do to use it.  Better than I ever could.
2008-08-20T06:43:00.000Z	Flannel	mcw	If you have further questions, feel free to ask them here.
2008-08-20T06:43:00.000Z	Flannel	mcw	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine  is the web site.  We're strict with staying on topic because there's lots of people who want support, and we can't have 100 conversations in the meantime.
2008-08-20T07:10:00.000Z	Flannel	mcw	please take off topic chatter to #ubuntu-offtopic, not here.  Thanks.
