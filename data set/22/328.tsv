2012-05-16T18:03:00.000Z	yeehaw	phunyguy	If you open a terminal and type an application name does it start?

2012-05-16T18:04:00.000Z	phunyguy		just unity is confused for some reason.
2012-05-16T18:05:00.000Z	yeehaw	phunyguy	What happens if you run: unity --reset-icons in terminal
2012-05-16T18:05:00.000Z	phunyguy		what does --reset-icons do before I do it?
2012-05-16T18:06:00.000Z	phunyguy		sounds dangerous.

2012-05-16T18:07:00.000Z	yeehaw	phunyguy	Could you check if unity-place-applications and unity-place-files are installed?
2012-05-16T18:09:00.000Z	phunyguy		Qalgi, language, and also the channel is always very full.
2012-05-16T18:10:00.000Z	phunyguy		!patience | Qalqi
2012-05-16T18:14:00.000Z	phunyguy	yeehaw	fwiw, rm ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite fixed my issue.  zeitgeist was out to lunch.  Just ran that and "unity --replace" and it's golden.
2012-05-16T18:15:00.000Z	yeehaw	phunyguy	ok, good to know
