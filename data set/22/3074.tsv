2008-12-13T04:39:00.000Z	nordin		32 bits or 64 ?
2008-12-13T04:39:00.000Z	hischild	nordin	i've seen faster quad cores then that, it's nothing special anymore.
2008-12-13T04:43:00.000Z	hischild	nordin	you can run a 64bit kernel with a 32bit OS. actually, it's recommended to do so on PS3 for some reasons.
2008-12-13T04:50:00.000Z	nordin	hischild	why? if you compile an application for a 64 bits platform, it should be optimized for that type
2008-12-13T04:51:00.000Z	hischild	nordin	true. But not all programs work on 64bit. Also, what's the use of it? more then 4gb of ram? my laptop has 3, pc has 2gb. higher speeds? not really, the 3% increase in speed isn't that good.
2008-12-13T04:53:00.000Z	nordin	hischild	what's the use of it is another question
2008-12-13T04:53:00.000Z	hischild	nordin	and the biggest one of all ... a true 64bit app would never be able to run on a 32bit system. It'd have to use the available bits for its operations, something you could never do on a 32bit. So IMO either use 32bit, unless you need to use 64bit and not the other way around. /
2008-12-13T04:54:00.000Z	nordin	hischild	I doubt about that. I just takes more clockcycles to get instuctions done
2008-12-13T04:54:00.000Z	hischild	nordin	about 4 - 6 more clock cycles, not counting the ones needed to convert the instructions.
2008-12-13T04:55:00.000Z	nordin	hischild	but it's still possible to run on a 32 bits
2008-12-13T04:55:00.000Z	hischild	nordin	not without special apps to convert it.
2008-12-13T04:56:00.000Z	nordin	hischild	I don't think so, we are dealing only with numbers, size doesn't matter :p
2008-12-13T04:56:00.000Z	hischild	nordin	oh but size does matter. How else would you execute a 64bit instruction on something that can't understand more then 32bit?
2008-12-13T04:57:00.000Z	nordin	hischild	64 btis instruction?? 64 bits means 64 bits wide registers
2008-12-13T04:58:00.000Z	nordin	hischild	I also develope software for ARM microcontrollers, you can switch 32 bits to 16 bits, same concept
2008-12-13T04:58:00.000Z	hischild	nordin	kinda different then 64 to 32. i don't want to call you off with this, but this discussion is outside of the scope of this channel.
2008-12-13T04:59:00.000Z	nordin	hischild	yes you are right that it's off-topic
2008-12-13T04:59:00.000Z	nordin	hischild	but it is still possible
2008-12-13T05:00:00.000Z	hischild	nordin	yes, it is possible.
2008-12-13T05:00:00.000Z	nordin	hischild	if you wirte software, do you look what kind of CPU your app will run on. No!
2008-12-13T05:01:00.000Z	hischild	nordin	don't make me call stop on this
2008-12-13T05:01:00.000Z	nordin	hischild	ok maybe next time on a another channel
