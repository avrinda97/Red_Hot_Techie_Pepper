2008-07-20T17:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shishio	You need to rephrase your question, it is not clear, but If I understand it. you can use sudo/root to read from your account
2008-07-20T17:56:00.000Z	shishio	Jack_Sparrow	my question is... is it possible for hackers to take down my ubuntu system? or put keyloggers
2008-07-20T17:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shishio	very unlikely.. but you would need to be more specific
2008-07-20T17:57:00.000Z	shishio	Jack_Sparrow	i lost my msn account... i was wondering how i lost it
2008-07-20T17:58:00.000Z	shishio	Jack_Sparrow	im using ubuntu btw
2008-07-20T17:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shishio	were you running amsn or were you under wine?

2008-07-20T17:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shishio	I dont use msn.. but It is very unlikely that someone hacked you unless you make a habit of running programs from people you dont know
2008-07-20T18:00:00.000Z	shishio	Jack_Sparrow	u know where would i go if i want my msn account back? coz i want it back
2008-07-20T18:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shishio	I would not know where to start, but pidgin might have an answer,  What version of pidgin are you using?

2008-07-20T18:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shishio	That is not what I asked

2008-07-20T18:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shishio	ask in #windows
2008-07-20T18:05:00.000Z	shishio	Jack_Sparrow	will i ever get my msn account back there? what about my pidgin, is it safe?
2008-07-20T18:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shishio	that is a different question
2008-07-20T18:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shishio	if someone figured out your password they you wont get it back if they changed it
2008-07-20T18:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shishio	create a second account and watch for activity with your user name
