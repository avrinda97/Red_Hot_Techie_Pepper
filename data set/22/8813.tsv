2005-05-13T13:09:00.000Z	aziz		hello .... is there an Ubuntu package for egroupware ?
2005-05-13T13:10:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	yes it's in one of the repositories
2005-05-13T13:10:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	I think it's universe repository
2005-05-13T13:11:00.000Z	aziz	Nula	can you help me adding this repository, please ? cuz I only got the defaults ..
2005-05-13T13:11:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	click system->administration->synaptic package manager
2005-05-13T13:12:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	then in the menu select settings->repositories
2005-05-13T13:12:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	then click add, and add universe and multiverse repositories for Hoary 5.04 (click the check boxes)
2005-05-13T13:13:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	once that's done you can search for egroupware and it should be listed in the packages
2005-05-13T13:14:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	welcome
2005-05-13T13:18:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	it's for ubuntu .. then again some ubuntu packages come from debian and work on both distros
2005-05-13T13:23:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	when  you install egroupware, it install apache for you.. it's a dependancy
2005-05-13T13:24:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	the choice made by egroupware works just fine.. I have tested it personally
2005-05-13T13:24:00.000Z	aziz	Nula	i used apt-get but it only suggested these packages: apache-common apache-ssl apache2-utils .. no main apache package was suggested
2005-05-13T13:26:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	huh.. that's odd.. I installed egroupware on a fresh Hoary install and it installed apache ... I would go ahead and install egroupware.. I am positive apache a dependancy
2005-05-13T13:27:00.000Z	aziz	Nula	oh you right ... I just saw it
2005-05-13T13:27:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	:)
2005-05-13T13:29:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	yea
2005-05-13T13:31:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	mysql
2005-05-13T13:32:00.000Z	aziz	Nula	how do i check if mysql is installed or not ?
2005-05-13T13:37:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	once you are done installing go to http://localhost/egroupware/setup  to setup everything.. it will walk you through step by step.. apt-get install mysql if you don't have int installed.. the egroupware setup wizard will configure the database for you after that
2005-05-13T13:41:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	apt-get install egroupware should be enough
2005-05-13T13:44:00.000Z	Nula	aziz	do apache-ssl if you want more security
