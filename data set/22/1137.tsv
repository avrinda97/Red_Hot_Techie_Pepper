2010-09-21T07:30:00.000Z	Sterist		USB booting is suicide by time
2010-09-21T07:31:00.000Z	manlymatt83	Sterist	My CDROM is broken
2010-09-21T07:31:00.000Z	Sterist	manlymatt83	cheap external hdd?'
2010-09-21T07:32:00.000Z	Sterist		mirc Ubuntu Software Center
2010-09-21T07:32:00.000Z	manlymatt83		Also, is there any difference between Ubuntu net install and Ubuntu alternate CD?  I know the net install installs over the net, but I'm on a super fast network connection right now, so no issue there.  But the live CD wasn't booting for me, while the alternate was.... does the net CD practice the same sort of install?
2010-09-21T07:32:00.000Z	Sterist		put the cursor in the top-right box and type in whatever you desire
2010-09-21T07:33:00.000Z	Sterist	manlymatt83	have you adjusted your PC's BIOs to look for a CD at boot?
2010-09-21T07:33:00.000Z	manlymatt83	Sterist	Yes.  My CDROM is broken.  Caputt.  Don't have one.  Ordered one, but it isn't here yet.
2010-09-21T07:34:00.000Z	manlymatt83		But still, even when I extract 10.04 live to a USB key drive, it won't work.  The install craps out.
2010-09-21T07:34:00.000Z	manlymatt83		But when I use the alternate CD, it works fine
2010-09-21T07:34:00.000Z	manlymatt83		but the alternate CD doesn't let me install from the net, so I'm wondering if the net install is just as simple as the alternate CD (the text based installer, etc.)
2010-09-21T07:34:00.000Z	manlymatt83		I guess my question is this: what's the difference between the alternate CD and the netinstall CD?
2010-09-21T07:35:00.000Z	Sterist		mirc i've been having trouble with that install method myself
2010-09-21T07:36:00.000Z	Sterist	manlymatt83	since your CD drive is out, change the PC bios to look in this order #1 CD (for when you get the new one), #2 USB, and #3 internal HDD, then copy the ISO to a usb stick
2010-09-21T07:37:00.000Z	Sterist	manlymatt83	the difference is alternate uses a different type of installer (usually for low spec computers) to do the main install. net install downloads minimal core files and gets the rest when you update
2010-09-21T07:40:00.000Z	Sterist		mouse funny.... i just did that literally 1 hour ago
2010-09-21T07:40:00.000Z	manlymatt83	Sterist	So I can use the built in unetbootin net install for 10.04 and it should work just fine?
2010-09-21T07:40:00.000Z	manlymatt83		to copy to 10.04?
2010-09-21T07:41:00.000Z	Sterist	manlymatt83	well what OS are you using right now?
2010-09-21T07:42:00.000Z	manlymatt83	Sterist	10.04, but it's a botched install
2010-09-21T07:42:00.000Z	manlymatt83	Sterist	I've got the alternate 10.04 install .iso downloaded, but I can't use the start up disk creator built into lucid - it isn't working
2010-09-21T07:43:00.000Z	Sterist	manlymatt83	can you download qBitTorrent via software center and get the ISO? unetbootin should be a last resort of all
