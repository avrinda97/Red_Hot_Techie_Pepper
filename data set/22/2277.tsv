2009-08-01T21:54:00.000Z	defrysk	RioKuro	then stick to arch
2009-08-01T21:54:00.000Z	defrysk	RioKuro	its seems its your type of distro
2009-08-01T21:54:00.000Z	RioKuro	defrysk	that's just lame saying that
2009-08-01T21:55:00.000Z	defrysk	RioKuro	its seems its your type of distro
2009-08-01T21:55:00.000Z	RioKuro	defrysk	i know it's possible, i've done it a long time ago
2009-08-01T21:55:00.000Z	defrysk	RioKuro	its not lame, if oyu like to tinker and compile you should not use ubuntu
2009-08-01T21:56:00.000Z	RioKuro	defrysk	ubuntu is just as much linux as arch or slackware is
2009-08-01T21:56:00.000Z	RioKuro	defrysk	it's based on debian right? if that isn't a tinker os than i don't know what is
2009-08-01T21:57:00.000Z	defrysk	RioKuro	yes, but some are geared to general usage nd others are geared to optimazations and tinkering
2009-08-01T21:57:00.000Z	defrysk	RioKuro	ubuntu is for general usage and has precompliled pachages
2009-08-01T21:57:00.000Z	RioKuro	defrysk	i just think it was an easy way out you know. I like linux because it's flexible.
2009-08-01T21:58:00.000Z	defrysk	RioKuro	hence the choice in distros
2009-08-01T21:58:00.000Z	defrysk	RioKuro	ubuntu does not support homebrew and tinkering
2009-08-01T21:59:00.000Z	RioKuro	defrysk	thats the funniest thing i've heard today
2009-08-01T21:59:00.000Z	defrysk	RioKuro	if you mold a package to your likings, and have a question about it after, how to answer it ?
2009-08-01T22:00:00.000Z	RioKuro	defrysk	you research knowing things can be different with your package
2009-08-01T22:02:00.000Z	defrysk	RioKuro	I like tinkering and use arch/paldo for that, for daily usage i prefer trouble free and maybe a tad slower ubuntu
2009-08-01T22:03:00.000Z	RioKuro	defrysk	i know i can have best of both worlds, although to bad pacman won't work on ubuntu
2009-08-01T22:03:00.000Z	defrysk	RioKuro	we are getting off topic so lets end this now
2009-08-01T22:04:00.000Z	RioKuro	defrysk	i think i've just found it
2009-08-01T22:04:00.000Z	RioKuro	defrysk	dpkg-buildpackage
2009-08-01T22:05:00.000Z	defrysk	RioKuro	cool
