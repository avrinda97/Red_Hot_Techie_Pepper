2009-11-17T23:59:00.000Z	amy_		i want to retrieve my username and password
2009-11-17T23:59:00.000Z	amy_		does anyone know how to retrieve it
2009-11-17T23:59:00.000Z	amy_		I have lost my username and password
2009-11-17T23:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	amy_	boot into recovery mode (in grub ) drop to a root shell. The name of the folder under /home/ is your username. then reset password doing « passwd your_username »
2009-11-18T00:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	amy_	that's the easiest imho
2009-11-18T00:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	amy_	for doing that you wil have to do what i say (drop to a root shell)
2009-11-18T00:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	amy_	so once you are there why not recover the one you already have
2009-11-18T00:03:00.000Z	amy_	erUSUL	I don't know how to g to rootshell
2009-11-18T00:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	amy_	When the computer boots you are shown a menu where you can choose what OS to boot
2009-11-18T00:04:00.000Z	amy_	erUSUL	I don't have the dual boot if that is what u mean
2009-11-18T00:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	amy_	in the list there are items with "(recovery mode)" at the end. choose one of them (with cursor keys) and press enter
2009-11-18T00:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	amy_	if you do not have dual boot press scape key while booting. the menu should show up
2009-11-18T00:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	amy_	again ---> in the list there are items with "(recovery mode)" at the end. choose one of them (with cursor keys) and press enter
2009-11-18T00:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	amy_	you then will be presented with another menu. one item is "drop to a root shell" or something like that
2009-11-18T00:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	amy_	choose that. in the promt type this « ls /home/ » it should return a list of usernames (home folders)
2009-11-18T00:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	amy_	finally once you know the username run « passwd username » you wil be asked for a new password twice
2009-11-18T00:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	amy_	everything including bookmarks ? of firefox ? clean start ? rm -r ~/.mozilla/
2010-06-13T18:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	amy_	if you have lame intalled something like this should work. ffmpeg -i video.flv audio.mp3
2010-06-13T18:50:00.000Z	amy_	erUSUL	the main thing is I don't have lame installed
2010-06-13T18:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	amy_	sudo aptitude install lame ?
