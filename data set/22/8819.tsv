2005-05-13T10:53:00.000Z	Burgundavia	orhs	Ubuntu uses a package managment system called apt
2005-05-13T10:53:00.000Z	Burgundavia	orhs	it is advisable to use that
2005-05-13T10:54:00.000Z	orhs	Burgundavia	can you tell me some more about what apt do??
2005-05-13T10:54:00.000Z	Burgundavia	orhs	apt allows you to install and remove software from your system easily
2005-05-13T10:54:00.000Z	Burgundavia	orhs	thus you need system-->admin-->synaptic
2005-05-13T10:54:00.000Z	Burgundavia	orhs	search in there for a rootkit hunter
2005-05-13T10:55:00.000Z	orhs	Burgundavia	so all i do is su then apt <filename> ??
2005-05-13T10:55:00.000Z	Burgundavia	orhs	synaptic is a gui frontend to apt-get
2005-05-13T10:55:00.000Z	Burgundavia	orhs	open it up and take a look
2005-05-13T10:56:00.000Z	orhs	Burgundavia	thank you :)
2005-05-13T10:56:00.000Z	Burgundavia	orhs	np
2005-05-13T10:56:00.000Z	Burgundavia	orhs	it is not recommended you install random, non-deb stuff
2005-05-13T11:00:00.000Z	orhs	Burgundavia	i cant seem to find the programs that i have downloaded
2005-05-13T11:00:00.000Z	Burgundavia	orhs	it should be there
2005-05-13T11:00:00.000Z	Burgundavia	orhs	right click on the package and it will list the package contents
2005-05-13T11:00:00.000Z	Burgundavia	orhs	look for a file in /usr/bin
2005-05-13T11:01:00.000Z	orhs	Burgundavia	does the folder need to be unpacked?
2005-05-13T11:32:00.000Z	Burgundavia	orhs	did you read www.ubuntu.com/wiki/RootSudo
2005-05-13T12:21:00.000Z	Burgundavia	orhs	or use synatpic
