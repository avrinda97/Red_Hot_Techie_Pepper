2009-01-16T05:07:00.000Z	pwhipp		help - my xwindows is broken after the ubuntu nvidia driver update. how do I get it to start with the default drivers?
2009-01-16T05:08:00.000Z	runderwo	pwhipp	in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf, change Driver 'nvidia' to Driver 'nv'
2009-01-16T05:08:00.000Z	pwhipp	runderwo	thanks I'll try that now
2009-01-16T05:15:00.000Z	pwhipp	runderwo	that resulted in a completely blank screen
2009-01-16T05:16:00.000Z	runderwo	pwhipp	interesting
2009-01-16T05:16:00.000Z	pwhipp	runderwo	system is in a mess I think. How do I get out of the blank screen without making things worse
2009-01-16T05:17:00.000Z	runderwo	pwhipp	try changing 'nv' to 'vesa' :)
2009-01-16T05:18:00.000Z	pwhipp	runderwo	ok - will have to try to get in first...
2009-01-16T05:18:00.000Z	runderwo	pwhipp	ctrl-alt-F1 ?
2009-01-16T05:18:00.000Z	pwhipp	runderwo	does nothing
2009-01-16T05:19:00.000Z	runderwo	pwhipp	you can reboot into single user mode, too
2009-01-16T05:19:00.000Z	pwhipp	runderwo	what is single user mode?
2009-01-16T05:20:00.000Z	runderwo	pwhipp	reboot and choose the recovery option at the boot menu
2009-01-16T05:20:00.000Z	pwhipp	runderwo	I've just used the top recovery mode to get back in
2009-01-16T05:20:00.000Z	runderwo	pwhipp	yep
2009-01-16T05:21:00.000Z	pwhipp	runderwo	i think I know why it was a blank screen - dual monitors
2009-01-16T05:21:00.000Z	runderwo	pwhipp	that would complicate things
2009-01-16T05:23:00.000Z	pwhipp	runderwo	indeed. so... I'll try commenting out the twin view and other option under screen
2009-01-16T05:26:00.000Z	pwhipp	runderwo	still black. will try vesa as driver...
2009-01-16T05:26:00.000Z	runderwo	pwhipp	:)
2009-01-16T05:42:00.000Z	pwhipp	runderwo	tried a default config from http://forums.msiwind.net/default-msiwind/xorg-conf-for-ubuntu-t6963.html - and unplugged second monitor - I have windows!
2009-01-16T05:42:00.000Z	runderwo	pwhipp	slow and steady from here :)
