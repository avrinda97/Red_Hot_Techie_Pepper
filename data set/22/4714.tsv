2007-10-28T05:45:00.000Z	ray2007		may i ask a question about ssh from ubuntu on pc to macbook?
2007-10-28T05:46:00.000Z	ray2007		using network tools, i can see the macbook (rays-macbook.local)
2007-10-28T05:46:00.000Z	ray2007		but it keeps saying connection refused when i ssh ray@192.168.1.108
2007-10-28T05:47:00.000Z	ray2007		pelo, i'm sorry. should i put that all in at one time?

2007-10-28T05:49:00.000Z	ray2007		yes
2007-10-28T05:50:00.000Z	maquinax	ray2007	connection refused usually means that your host is closing the connection for whatever reason
2007-10-28T05:51:00.000Z	maquinax	ray2007	in the macbook can you do ssh localhost ?
2007-10-28T05:51:00.000Z	maquinax	ray2007	and if so, do you have a firewall turned on on the mac side? that might prevent things from working
2007-10-28T05:52:00.000Z	maquinax	ray2007	are you sure you are running ssh in the macbook?
2007-10-28T05:52:00.000Z	maquinax	ray2007	do ps -fea | grep ssh and look at the output
2007-10-28T05:54:00.000Z	ray2007	maquinax	what should i be looking for?
2007-10-28T05:54:00.000Z	maquinax	ray2007	something like sshd, connection refused means that the port is closed
2007-10-28T05:56:00.000Z	maquinax	ray2007	you are trying to ssh from ubunto to mac, right?
2007-10-28T05:57:00.000Z	maquinax	ray2007	according to your msg a few min ago, : "but it keeps saying connection refused when i ssh ray@192.168.1.108"
2007-10-28T05:58:00.000Z	maquinax	ray2007	ah ok, sorry, my mistake, i meant to say you should look at something like this : "root     17423     1  0 10:56 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/sshd" if you dont, it means the ssh server is not running
2007-10-28T05:59:00.000Z	maquinax	ray2007	you should look at the macs documentation to see how to enable the ssh server
2007-10-28T06:02:00.000Z	ray2007	maquinax	it was totally my fault
2007-10-28T06:03:00.000Z	maquinax	ray2007	good to know :)
2007-10-28T06:03:00.000Z	ray2007	maquinax	thanks again
2007-10-28T06:03:00.000Z	maquinax	ray2007	no prob :)
2007-10-28T06:14:00.000Z	maquinax	ray2007	just do ssh -X user@host, then type nautilus &
