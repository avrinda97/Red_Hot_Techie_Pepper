2012-10-09T23:49:00.000Z	TJ-	paulus68	what kind of proxy?
2012-10-09T23:50:00.000Z	paulus68	TJ-	squid
2012-10-09T23:52:00.000Z	TJ-	paulus68	SQUIDHOST="somehostname"; echo 'Acquire::http::Proxy "http://$SQUIDHOST:3142";' | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy
2012-10-09T23:53:00.000Z	paulus68	TJ-	what do I need to enter at hostname? anything
2012-10-09T23:54:00.000Z	TJ-	paulus68	The hostname/IP address of the SQUID proxy machine
2012-10-09T23:59:00.000Z	paulus68	TJ-	I get no address associated with hostname
2012-10-10T00:00:00.000Z	TJ-	paulus68	Is that from apt ?
2012-10-10T00:01:00.000Z	TJ-	paulus68	Well you need to ensure, if you've used a hostname, that it does resolve correctly. If the hostname won't resolve, then use the IP address
2012-10-10T00:02:00.000Z	TJ-	paulus68	e.g. on my network I have "Acquire::http::Proxy "http://10.254.251.1:3142";"
2012-10-10T00:02:00.000Z	paulus68	TJ-	mine is http://192.168.178.26:3128
2012-10-10T00:03:00.000Z	paulus68	TJ-	or do I need to adapt the localhost?
2012-10-10T00:03:00.000Z	TJ-	paulus68	So you put that into /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy
2012-10-10T00:03:00.000Z	paulus68	TJ-	did that same error
2012-10-10T00:04:00.000Z	TJ-	paulus68	I think there may be a typo on your file. Can you pastebin it for us?
2012-10-10T00:29:00.000Z	paulus68	TJ-	I have in my file Acquire::http::Proxy "http://192.168.178.26:3128";
2012-10-10T00:30:00.000Z	TJ-	paulus68	That should work. if not, there's something else on that system/network causing issues.
2012-10-10T00:30:00.000Z	paulus68	TJ-	getting now Proxy authentication required
2012-10-10T00:30:00.000Z	paulus68	TJ-	407
2012-10-10T00:32:00.000Z	TJ-	paulus68	There you go. Your network proxy needs authentication. I've never tried using that with apt
2012-10-10T00:33:00.000Z	TJ-	paulus68	Ahhh OK it's easy. Just add the username and password to the 01proxy statement similar to this: Acquire::http::Proxy "http://username:password@proxyhost:port/";
2012-10-10T00:36:00.000Z	paulus68	TJ-	ok
