2009-09-22T09:05:00.000Z	SunmanXII		hi, my flashplugin-nonfree is in the newest version but firefox still says i dont have the latest flash
2009-09-22T09:05:00.000Z	lstarnes	SunmanXII	flashplugin-nonfree is an older but somewhat more stable version of flasg
2009-09-22T09:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	SunmanXII	are you using the 64-bit version of ubuntu?
2009-09-22T09:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	SunmanXII	what response do you get from uname -m?
2009-09-22T09:11:00.000Z	SunmanXII	lstarnes	i686
2009-09-22T09:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	SunmanXII	then you have the 32-bit version
2009-09-22T09:12:00.000Z	SunmanXII	lstarnes	sorry then. so i cant get the new flash?
2009-09-22T09:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	SunmanXII	you could try downloading the .tar.gz, extracting it, then moving the libflashplayer.so into the mozilla/firefox plugins directory
2009-09-22T09:13:00.000Z	lstarnes	SunmanXII	the 32-bit version of flash is less buggy that the 64-bit build and is still kept up-to-date
2009-09-22T09:13:00.000Z	SunmanXII	lstarnes	im going to try extracting the file and putting it into the firefox plugins directory. see if that works
2009-09-22T09:25:00.000Z	SunmanXII	lstarnes	i moved libflashplayer.so into /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins but when i look through the list of firefox plugins it still has flash 9.0
2009-09-22T09:26:00.000Z	lstarnes	SunmanXII	you may need to remove the old plugins
2009-09-22T09:26:00.000Z	SunmanXII	lstarnes	 straight from the directory or do i just disable it in firefox and then reboot firefox
2009-09-22T09:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	SunmanXII	you will need to restart firefox
2009-09-22T09:27:00.000Z	SunmanXII	lstarnes	wais so do i disable the flash 9.0 plugin and then restart?
2009-09-22T09:28:00.000Z	lstarnes	SunmanXII	yes
2009-09-22T09:30:00.000Z	SunmanXII	lstarnes	 not working: i still ahve flashplayer 9.0 disabled and no new flash player. did i move it to the right directory even?
2009-09-22T09:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	SunmanXII	are you using adobe's flash 10?
2009-09-22T09:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	SunmanXII	flash 9 may still be in other directories
2009-09-22T09:31:00.000Z	SunmanXII	lstarnes	i downloaded and isntalled it but firefox doesnt use it. how do i totally remove flash 9 and put flash 10 in its place?
2009-09-22T09:32:00.000Z	lstarnes	SunmanXII	look for the other instances of libflashplayer.so.  Try using locate libflashplayer.so
2009-09-22T09:38:00.000Z	SunmanXII	lstarnes	mouseclone: i replaced every instance of libflashplayer.so and it worked! thanks!
