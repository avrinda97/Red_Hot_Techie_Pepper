2008-07-22T18:11:00.000Z	justinallen		hey all...i'm trying to get my "filesystem" to show on my desktop but even checking the box in gconf-editor for volumes doesn't add that to my desktop...any ideas?  CD-ROM and network shares show up fine......
2008-07-22T18:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	justinallen	mounts in media will show on desktop
2008-07-22T18:13:00.000Z	justinallen	Jack_Sparrow	 so if i just edit my fstab to change to media, that should do the trick?
2008-07-22T18:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	justinallen	as long as you are using a valid mount point..   yes it should
2008-07-22T18:15:00.000Z	justinallen	Jack_Sparrow	 I will give that a shot...kinda new to the whole linux thing...hehe...thanks!
2008-07-22T18:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	justinallen	one sec
2008-07-22T18:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	justinallen	do you have a local partition that is not mounted
2008-07-22T18:16:00.000Z	justinallen	Jack_Sparrow	 I'm not sure...how would I check that?
2008-07-22T18:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	justinallen	Just for reference  here is how you mount manually    From the terminal/CLI type... sudo mkdir /media/disk-1  then   sudo mount /dev/sda(x)  /media/disk-1 (x) being your partition
2008-07-22T18:18:00.000Z	justinallen	Jack_Sparrow	um ok...but how can I tell if I have a partition that is not being mounted...that, i'm not sure of....
2008-07-22T18:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	justinallen	sudo fdisk -l   last letter is L will list all partitions
2008-07-22T18:22:00.000Z	justinallen	Jack_Sparrow	ok..it looks like all partitions are being mounted properly according to fdisk, mount and df commands :)
2008-07-22T18:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	justinallen	being mounted yes..  but the original point of our discussion was mount points in media showing up on your desktop
2008-07-22T18:24:00.000Z	justinallen	Jack_Sparrow	correct, but you wanted me to make sure everything was mounting and that there wasn't any paritions not being mounted right? or did i misunderstand what you wanted me to check...lol
2008-07-22T18:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	justinallen	I was going to have you manually mount any one of your unmounted partitions using /mdeia/ as a mount point so you could see they popped up on your desktop
2008-07-22T18:25:00.000Z	justinallen	Jack_Sparrow	ohhh ok..gotcha
2008-07-22T18:26:00.000Z	justinallen	Jack_Sparrow	 Is there any way I can change my /home mount while i'm logged in or do I need to change the fstab and restart?
2008-07-22T18:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	justinallen	uhhh, hold on, dont change mount point of home
2008-07-22T18:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	justinallen	Do you just want /home folder on your desktop?
2008-07-22T18:30:00.000Z	justinallen	Jack_Sparrow	 I would like "Filesystem" to show up on the desktop kinda like my network shares and my cd-rom and ipod and stuff show up...
2008-07-22T18:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	justinallen	You should not really need to dig that deep into your drive very often.  Do you do much as root user?
2008-07-22T18:32:00.000Z	justinallen	Jack_Sparrow	nope...i guess it's just one of those quirky things i'd like to see on my desktop...i'm strange like that....lol
