2007-06-22T07:58:00.000Z	wols_	soundray	but I doubt he needs it. but he won't answer my question
2007-12-20T05:32:00.000Z	soundray	wols_	you read binary MBRs?
2007-12-20T05:32:00.000Z	wols_	soundray	hex dumps. they're easy
2007-12-20T05:35:00.000Z	soundray	wols_	cool, thanks!
2007-12-20T06:00:00.000Z	wols_	soundray	use fs-driver.org
2007-12-20T06:01:00.000Z	soundray	wols_	is that better?
2007-12-20T06:01:00.000Z	wols_	soundray	it allows to write
2007-12-20T06:02:00.000Z	soundray	wols_	ext2fsd lets you write, and it's open source
2007-12-20T06:02:00.000Z	wols_	soundray	wasn't last I checked. good to know
2008-08-17T21:41:00.000Z	wols_	soundray	why would a ntfs partition be a full disk? windows really really doesn't like that
2008-08-17T21:41:00.000Z	soundray	wols_	it's how this disk is set up apparently
2008-08-17T21:42:00.000Z	wols_	soundray	windows cannot format a full hdd as ntfs. and if you give it a disk that is formatted like this, fat or ntfs (linux has no problems with this), it crashes
2008-08-17T21:43:00.000Z	soundray	wols_	thank you
2008-08-17T23:12:00.000Z	wols_	soundray	little? nothing!
2008-08-17T23:13:00.000Z	soundray	wols_	you could argue on a theoretical basis...
2008-08-17T23:13:00.000Z	wols_	soundray	I could argue about how many angels fit on a needle's tip too
2008-08-17T23:14:00.000Z	soundray	wols_	for example, if a drive is spun down, and RAM usage necessitates swapping, causing the drive to spin up, power usage goes up.
2008-08-17T23:14:00.000Z	wols_	soundray	ubuntu and XP use a bout the same amount of RAM. 256 is doable but bad, 512 is OK. Vista is different but not XP
2008-08-17T23:15:00.000Z	soundray	wols_	I wasn't replying to that part of the argument
2008-08-19T15:06:00.000Z	soundray	wols_	have you got another idea for Rafik?
2008-08-19T16:39:00.000Z	wols_	soundray	on windows?
2008-08-19T16:40:00.000Z	soundray	wols_	I don't know about Windows
