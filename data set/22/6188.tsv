2006-12-06T12:26:00.000Z	justincredible		Anyone here successfully configured an integrated bluetooth device?
2006-12-06T12:26:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	I've also tried w/ no success
2006-12-06T12:28:00.000Z	justincredible	MystaMax	what type of bluetooth device is integrated on your computer?
2006-12-06T12:29:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	my laptop is able to find bluetooth devices, but I haven't been able to transfer files or use the A2DP profile
2006-12-06T12:30:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	I also didnt spend alot of time on it. But my Dell D620 (dapper install) w/ integrated bluetooth found my phone, both my bluetooth stereo headphones, my cellphone bluetooth headsets. basically it found them all, but i can't use them for anything
2006-12-06T12:32:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	no i installed some packages
2006-12-06T12:32:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	from the repositories
2006-12-06T12:40:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	I've got gnome-bluetooth, bluez-utils, bluez-pin, bluez-pcmcia-support, and bluez-cups installed.
2006-12-06T12:42:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	So now under System -> Preferences I have Bluetooth Manager which can scan for my bluetooth devices. It'll find lots when I'm @ work, b/c all computers have bluetooth
2006-12-06T12:43:00.000Z	justincredible	MystaMax	are you using gnome or kde?
2006-12-06T12:44:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	Im using gnome. I just realized that I'm also using libbluetooth1, libbluetooh1-dev, libbtctl2-dev, libgnomebt0-dev, and python2.4-libbtctl
2006-12-06T12:44:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	I don't know much about KDE, sorry.
2006-12-06T12:46:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	yea i didnt do much to get it working. I found a thread on the forums explaining what the bluetooth manager was. So I installed it, and it started to scan. not much work involved, it just worked.
2006-12-06T12:52:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	right now I only can connect to my home wireless network, b/c I altered a txt file, isn't there a GUI to add/remove SSIDs and setup WPA or WEP
2006-12-06T12:56:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	no. I altered /etc/network/interfaces by adding my wireless-essid and thats it
2006-12-06T12:56:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	but i do see a wpa_supplicant folder in etc
2006-12-06T12:57:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	A GUI to manage different WiFi networks, and I'll worry about WPA later. Sorry if it seems confusing
2006-12-06T12:59:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	no i dont. its in the repositories?
2006-12-06T13:00:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	thanks will do.
2006-12-06T13:02:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	thats good to know. If I want to use WPA down the road should I use another app? I thought I came across a fedora core developed app for managing wifi networks.
2006-12-06T13:04:00.000Z	MystaMax	justincredible	ok Thanks. I found the redhat developed app called NetworkManager that does the same thing. I wonder what most ubuntu users use.
