2010-06-23T00:48:00.000Z	kyngdom		hey fellas, if i deleted my linux partition and am seeing grub-service>, am i fairly hosed if i want to set windows as the boot ?
2010-06-23T00:49:00.000Z	kyngdom		of ubuntu im assuming
2010-06-23T00:49:00.000Z	kyngdom		?
2010-06-23T00:50:00.000Z	kyngdom		thank you for the help Jordan_U
2010-06-23T00:51:00.000Z	virtualgeekhub	kyngdom	are you hoping to recover the windows boot loader and wipe ubuntu?
2010-06-23T00:52:00.000Z	kyngdom	virtualgeekhub	that was my intention. i had deleted the partition in windows, completely forgetting to deal with grub first. Jordan_U: I am downloading and burning a livecd now. I will do my best to read and fix, but I may need to ask a question later.
2010-06-23T00:55:00.000Z	kyngdom	virtualgeekhub	I am trying to find every reason to use ubuntu as my primary os, but i need a windows enviornment basically every week day and i've been apprehensive to use a vm
2010-06-23T00:55:00.000Z	virtualgeekhub	kyngdom	what is stopping you from using a virtual machine?
2010-06-23T00:57:00.000Z	kyngdom	virtualgeekhub	i suppose my biggest concern was a) interactivity with usb ports and other interfaces, and b) the overall performance degredation of running a VM , although that was just something I assumed. I have no real basis to say whether the performance would drop dramatically
2010-06-23T00:58:00.000Z	virtualgeekhub	kyngdom	Legitimate concerns. Well what does your hardware look like?
2010-06-23T01:00:00.000Z	virtualgeekhub	kyngdom	With that hardware you should be able to run a windows environment just fine ;)
2010-06-23T01:01:00.000Z	virtualgeekhub	kyngdom	Virtualized of course...
2010-06-23T01:02:00.000Z	virtualgeekhub	kyngdom	This is one of my main motivators for virtualizing most things, it can make things much easier (in some cases!).
2010-06-23T01:05:00.000Z	kyngdom	virtualgeekhub	so if i am completely virgin to linux (which i am for all intents and purposes, besides a few installations and abandonments), should i go windows with an ubuntu vm or ubuntu with a windows vm?
2010-06-23T01:06:00.000Z	virtualgeekhub	kyngdom	This is of course preference, I personally run Windows in a vm on an Ubuntu host, however I started the other way around.
2010-06-23T01:07:00.000Z	virtualgeekhub	kyngdom	Why don't you run an ubuntu vm from a Windows host first just to get the feel for Ubuntu? Then when your brave you can flip that scenario.
2010-06-23T01:09:00.000Z	virtualgeekhub	kyngdom	If your going to be going that route whats our next move?
2010-06-23T01:10:00.000Z	virtualgeekhub	kyngdom	That's cool, don't worry we were ALL new to Ubuntu once too, now it's second nature ;)
2010-06-23T01:12:00.000Z	virtualgeekhub	kyngdom	Yeah maybe that can be your crowning achievement once you get the hand of Ubuntu.
2010-06-23T01:12:00.000Z	virtualgeekhub	kyngdom	*hang
2010-06-23T01:14:00.000Z	virtualgeekhub	kyngdom	Funny though, I just switched from Server 08, I migrated my web site to Ubuntu (Apache), for the same concerns you have, Piracy...
2010-06-23T01:14:00.000Z	kyngdom	virtualgeekhub	im trying to be as legit as possible and the only real sore thumb sticking out in my entire lan seems to be my server
