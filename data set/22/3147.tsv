2008-11-26T02:41:00.000Z	paul4605	cyr1	still no go
2008-11-26T02:41:00.000Z	cyr1	paul4605	: new error logs?
2008-11-26T02:41:00.000Z	paul4605	cyr1	hold on
2008-11-26T02:45:00.000Z	paul4605	cyr1	http://paste.ubuntu.com/76931/    the only thing I see is that eth0 is entering promiscuous mode?
2008-11-26T02:45:00.000Z	paul4605	cyr1	could that be a reason that its going wrong?
2008-11-26T02:47:00.000Z	cyr1	paul4605	: all I see getting blocked there is UDP anyway, wierd, are you allowing DNS traffic?
2008-11-26T02:47:00.000Z	paul4605	cyr1	normally yes since I run a bind server
2008-11-26T02:49:00.000Z	paul4605	cyr1	activating the firewal and try to do an nslookup right?
2008-11-26T02:49:00.000Z	cyr1	paul4605	and can you get outbound from the firewall itself to, say google.com or something with links or lynx
2008-11-26T02:50:00.000Z	paul4605	cyr1	ok hold on
2008-11-26T02:51:00.000Z	cyr1	paul4605	: you running bind on the firewall as a cache?
2008-11-26T02:51:00.000Z	cyr1	paul4605	: because if not, I don't see a FORWARD rule to pass dns traffic
2008-11-26T02:52:00.000Z	paul4605	cyr1	as cache? meaning? the firewall is running now and the dnslookup is working from the server
2008-11-26T02:52:00.000Z	cyr1	paul4605	: is bind running on the firewall server, and you have all your clients pointed to it, or no?
2008-11-26T02:53:00.000Z	paul4605	cyr1	Not working from my laptop
2008-11-26T02:54:00.000Z	paul4605	cyr1	yes my server runs iptables firewall bind dhcp mysql webserver php apache
2008-11-26T02:54:00.000Z	cyr1	paul4605	: i bet thats what it is, all those blocked packets are trying to get to your dns servers at 195.130.130.130
2008-11-26T02:54:00.000Z	paul4605	cyr1	ok how do I solve this ?
2008-11-26T02:56:00.000Z	cyr1	paul4605	: I think you may need an INPUT rule for udp port 53
2008-11-26T02:57:00.000Z	cyr1	paul4605	: maybe something similar to your DHCP INPUT rule, except for port 53
2008-11-26T02:58:00.000Z	cyr1	paul4605	: $IPTABLES -A INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 67:68 -j ACCEPT
2008-11-26T02:58:00.000Z	cyr1	paul4605	: $IPTABLES -A INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
