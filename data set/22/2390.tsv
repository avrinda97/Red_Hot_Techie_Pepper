2011-02-02T17:44:00.000Z	gschwepp		Does anyone know how to pipe the wohle keyboard input ? so you cannot type with the keyboard anymore?
2011-02-02T17:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	gschwepp	is this for just one application?
2011-02-02T18:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	gschwepp	I've used cli programs that would use to drive keyboard events that I would point at windowed applications,  but I don't think that's what you want
2011-02-02T18:08:00.000Z	gschwepp	sacarlson	no :/ i just want the keyboard input piped to what ever not shown on screen. so if i type to firefox it shouldnt go there with this specific keyboard
2011-02-02T18:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	gschwepp	you can change focus of the keyboard to another application or window
2011-02-02T18:10:00.000Z	gschwepp	sacarlson	how?
2011-02-02T18:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	gschwepp	well you just click on another window that changes focus,  how do you want to control it from cli?
2011-02-02T18:10:00.000Z	gschwepp	sacarlson	actually i'd prefer sending a permanent stream of space to /dev/null that would be the best solution
2011-02-02T18:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	gschwepp	I don't understand how sending a stream to /dev/null has anything to do with the keyboard
2011-02-02T18:13:00.000Z	gschwepp	sacarlson	Did you read what i made? And what its good for?
2011-02-02T18:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	gschwepp	no how far back would I have to read to see it?
2011-02-02T18:16:00.000Z	gschwepp	sacarlson	i build from a keyboard a motion sensor. it should get my computer back from screensaver if somebody is getting near. Now i it is the case my sensor presses space.
2011-02-02T18:16:00.000Z	gschwepp	sacarlson	so i get my monitor back. i dont want to have space pressed all the time
2011-02-02T18:17:00.000Z	gschwepp	sacarlson	or not realised from my system all the time
2011-02-02T18:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	gschwepp	can't you just disable the screen saver?
2011-02-02T18:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	gschwepp	ok I get the idea,  can it hit another key or maybe temp remap keyboard so space isn't space
2011-02-02T18:23:00.000Z	gschwepp	sacarlson	fkrst
2011-02-02T18:24:00.000Z	gschwepp	sacarlson	first idea does not work because some programs are very unhappy about pressing random keys but the second one is quite interesting.
2011-02-02T18:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	gschwepp	cool, now you need to find a way to temp remap keyboard with a cli method
2011-02-02T18:26:00.000Z	gschwepp	sacarlson	yeah. but i wonder why i cannot pipe my keyboard device.
2011-02-02T18:28:00.000Z	gschwepp	sacarlson	cat /dev/input/by-id/[mydevice] | /dev/null would be the most easiest thing.  i wrote 3 keylogger today ;) but i wanted no output ... thats so unfair
2011-02-02T18:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	gschwepp	well you can change focus to window that does nothing so that would also work using something i think like xautomation
