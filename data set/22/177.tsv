2012-10-18T03:34:00.000Z	Radikal08		Man same here,its just that my macbook has stopped working :( so i run windows and ubuntu on this map :(
2012-10-18T03:34:00.000Z	Radikal08		Oh no, not yet.. sorry, i thought i could chat here..
2012-10-18T03:34:00.000Z	Radikal08		Thank you, and i apologize
2012-10-18T03:36:00.000Z	Radikal08		I do have a question actually. Ubuntu 12.04.01 doesnt run very well on my computer. This version is alot cleaner than 9.04 that I usd with different graphical tweaks (compiz or gnome??)... I dont know why the last version is slow.. I wonder if there is any easy way to speed it up by disabling processes that i might not need or so? I hope this is a common issue and that maybe someone knows what to do.. if not, i guess my cmoputer is
2012-10-18T03:36:00.000Z	Radikal08		 just to slow for it
2012-10-18T03:36:00.000Z	nydel	Radikal08	i would recommend that you turn off all compiz effects and disable ALL desktop/window effects
2012-10-18T03:37:00.000Z	nydel	Radikal08	myself, i have switched to cinnamon. you can get the package with apt-get or aptitude. or just use gnome. also there are other managers other than unity (that is what you are using) which are much less graphics-heavy
2012-10-18T03:37:00.000Z	nydel	Radikal08	how important is it to you that your computer look flashy
2012-10-18T03:38:00.000Z	nydel	Radikal08	cinnamon is small, and it's beautiful - i really think yo should just try that.
2012-10-18T03:38:00.000Z	nydel	Radikal08	are you opposed to trying somethign other than unity/compiz?

2012-10-18T03:50:00.000Z	nydel	Radikal08	type this
2012-10-18T03:51:00.000Z	nydel	Radikal08	no problem, thank /you/ for trying cinnamon, i really want it to get more popular.
2012-10-18T03:52:00.000Z	nydel	Radikal08	yes it's still ubuntu. we do not technically support cinnamon
2012-10-18T03:52:00.000Z	nydel	Radikal08	but you will have the option of using unity (as it is now) still even after you install cinnamon
2012-10-18T03:53:00.000Z	nydel	Radikal08	at the login screen, in the upper right corner of the box around your name where you enter your password, you can click the circle & select cinnamon or unity or gnome
