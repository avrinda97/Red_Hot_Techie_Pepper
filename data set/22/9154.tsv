2005-04-28T09:17:00.000Z	Levander		Nobody remembers the name of the X-Windows application to move the screen's position left or right or up and down on the monitory?
2005-04-28T09:17:00.000Z	Amaranth	Levander	We call those monitor controls. :) Should have buttons or a little wheel on the front of your monitor.
2005-04-28T09:18:00.000Z	Levander	Amaranth	don't want to use monitor controls, I share this monitor with XP via a KVM switch, using the monitor controls will mess up where XP displays its screen
2005-04-28T09:19:00.000Z	Amaranth	Levander	Then set the resolution and refresh rate to be the same on both. If that doesn't make them the same your driver sucks on one platform or the other.
2005-04-28T09:21:00.000Z	Levander	Amaranth	so is configuring X-Windows in general....
2005-05-03T08:46:00.000Z	Amaranth	Levander	Most people say it's the other way around.
2005-05-03T08:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	Levander	I didn't really notice a difference because I used apps that mangle the heap.
2005-05-03T09:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	Levander	You just got lucky.
2005-05-03T09:10:00.000Z	Amaranth	Levander	It's a mangled heap issue. If you have UUxxxxxxxxxxxxU where U is used and x is free on the heap that whole section will be assigned to the app. This is why firefox and nautilus eat RAM.
2005-05-03T09:10:00.000Z	Amaranth	Levander	If that last U get freed somehow it'll shrink the UU.
2005-05-03T09:12:00.000Z	Levander	Amaranth	you gotta link about what your talking about with the memory, I'm just elated how much less memory I'm using, and want to hear about what's going on for everybody else.  Is possible I can even figure out why I'm lucky
2005-05-03T09:13:00.000Z	Amaranth	Levander	heap == memory :)
2005-05-03T09:14:00.000Z	Levander	Amaranth	I understood what you said, just would like to read more.
2005-05-03T09:14:00.000Z	Amaranth	Levander	I don't know what else to way...
2005-05-03T09:19:00.000Z	Levander	Amaranth	did I miss a link about that memory issue, have been doing a couple of other things...
2005-05-03T09:19:00.000Z	Amaranth	Levander	Nope, because I don't understand what you want.
2005-05-03T09:20:00.000Z	Levander	Amaranth	you're talking about some memory bug present in hoary, wanted to read more about it
2005-05-03T09:20:00.000Z	Amaranth	Levander	It's not a bug, it's the way malloc() works.
2005-05-03T09:21:00.000Z	Levander	Amaranth	so even warty was like that?  I thought you were trying to explain why most people have higher memory use in Hoary than Warty?
2005-05-03T09:21:00.000Z	Amaranth	Levander	warty was the same, yes.
2005-05-03T09:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	Levander	So was foo distro from 1992.
2005-05-03T09:22:00.000Z	Levander	Amaranth	okay, thanks
