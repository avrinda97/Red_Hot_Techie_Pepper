2012-04-04T13:06:00.000Z	schnuffle1	nickie	/var/log/apache2
2012-04-04T13:07:00.000Z	nickie	schnuffle1	would you like me to just paste them all?
2012-04-04T13:08:00.000Z	schnuffle1	nickie	No, To sort out why it is not working: Check the config, call a page with SSI and see what happens in the logs
2012-04-04T13:11:00.000Z	schnuffle1	nickie	 So what is not working if the sidebar include works?
2012-04-04T13:12:00.000Z	schnuffle1	nickie	so you want to include some scripts that get executed?
2012-04-04T13:14:00.000Z	schnuffle1	nickie	Is mod_include activated?
2012-04-04T13:15:00.000Z	nickie	schnuffle1	how do i tell?
2012-04-04T13:15:00.000Z	schnuffle1	nickie	Do you have AddOutputFilter  configured for specific files e.g. .shtml?
2012-04-04T13:15:00.000Z	schnuffle1	nickie	 a2enmod
2012-04-04T13:16:00.000Z	nickie	schnuffle1	yeah i a2enmod'd it.
2012-04-04T13:23:00.000Z	schnuffle1	nickie	Do you have AddOutputFilter  configured for specific files e.g. .shtml?
2012-04-04T13:23:00.000Z	nickie	schnuffle1	how do i find that out?
2012-04-04T13:24:00.000Z	schnuffle1	nickie	find /etc/apache2 -type f -exec grep -H  AddOutputFilter  {} \;
2012-04-04T13:26:00.000Z	schnuffle1	nickie	No, maybe sudo is necessary. Have you tried to rename your file to <name>.shtml?
2012-04-04T13:28:00.000Z	schnuffle1	nickie	add "XBitHack on" to your apache conf and set all html files that need includes to chmod +x
2012-04-04T13:29:00.000Z	schnuffle1	nickie	And you should start reading about howto configure it in the docs. A bit of reading makes it much more easier to understand
2012-04-04T13:30:00.000Z	schnuffle1	nickie	create a file in conf.d and add it there
2012-04-04T13:31:00.000Z	schnuffle1	nickie	http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/ssi.html
2012-04-04T13:31:00.000Z	schnuffle1	nickie	no quotes
2012-04-04T13:44:00.000Z	nickie	schnuffle1	still no luck, but oh well.  Thank you very much for all your help! :)
