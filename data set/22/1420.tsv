2010-05-21T05:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wild_bat	I guess not then, it's bee a while since I've booted this way.
2010-05-21T05:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wild_bat	grub2 runs fine in cygwin
2010-05-21T05:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wild_bat	And there must be a way to install it without cygwin as well, since wubi does.
2010-05-21T05:57:00.000Z	wild_bat	Jordan_U	hmmm ~ i will be nice to have one w/o cygwin (pain >.<) ~ for making the boot usb ;p ~
2010-05-21T06:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wild_bat	If you want to create a boot USB for booting iso files you can use any dd like tool to copy super grub2 disk to a USB drive. It contains a script that will detect loop bootable isos (at boot time) in /boot-isos/ and make menu entries for them.
2010-05-21T06:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wild_bat	Of course, the downside being that you loose whatever is on the flash drive currently (unless you do some hackery with the partition table)
2010-05-21T06:02:00.000Z	wild_bat	Jordan_U	i know ~ but a pc w/o linux or cygwin ~ can't do it ~ so burnning cd is a must :<
2010-05-21T06:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wild_bat	There are tools for windows that will let you copy a drive image to a USB drive.
2010-05-21T06:03:00.000Z	wild_bat	Jordan_U	hmm ~ should be let me search ^^ thanks
2010-05-21T06:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wild_bat	You're welcome.
2010-05-21T06:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wild_bat	http://prdownload.berlios.de/supergrub/super_grub_disk_hybrid-1.98s1.iso (don't let the .iso confuse you, it can be used as an iso, floppy, or drive image)
2010-05-21T06:06:00.000Z	wild_bat	Jordan_U	wow thanks
2010-05-21T06:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wild_bat	You're welcome.
2010-05-21T06:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wild_bat	The msdos partition has no filesystem, it's just there so that operating systems don't try to write to that part of the drive and clobber it.
2010-05-21T06:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wild_bat	It being supergrub
2010-05-21T06:27:00.000Z	wild_bat	Jordan_U	hehe ~ never try th super grub be4 XD , its grub 2 have lua support ^^ nice ~
2010-05-21T06:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wild_bat	If you manually mount /dev/sdb rather than /dev/sdb1 (or whatever your USB drive is called) you can access the iso filesystem. Obviously linux doesn't expect to find an iso filesystem on a USB drive, but if you point it to it then it will mount it without complaint :)
2010-05-21T06:30:00.000Z	wild_bat	Jordan_U	hehe ~ trying to export the "super" out to a regular ntfs + grub2 now ~^^
2010-05-21T06:34:00.000Z	wild_bat	Jordan_U	do you know if the grub2 come with ubuntu got lua aupport?
2010-05-21T06:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wild_bat	No, unfortunately. I'm trying to get it included though (I fixed the main 'bug' originally holding it back)
2010-05-21T06:36:00.000Z	wild_bat	Jordan_U	yay~!
