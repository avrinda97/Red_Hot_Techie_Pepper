2008-03-07T19:20:00.000Z	Lacrymology		excuse me, I did a really stupid thing
2008-03-07T19:20:00.000Z	Lacrymology		I was playing with compiz configuration
2008-03-07T19:20:00.000Z	Lacrymology		and there was this option
2008-03-07T19:20:00.000Z	Lacrymology		"inside cube"
2008-03-07T19:20:00.000Z	Lacrymology		so I check it
2008-03-07T19:20:00.000Z	Lacrymology		and I'm inside the cube, and can't access my windows
2008-03-07T19:20:00.000Z	Lacrymology		anyone's got any ideas?
2008-03-07T19:21:00.000Z	anolis	Lacrymology	lol, you can delete the config file out of /home/username/.compiz

2008-03-07T19:23:00.000Z	Lacrymology	anolis	neither... the one I said exists, but it hasn't any "inside cube" option
2008-03-07T19:23:00.000Z	anolis	Lacrymology	try going to a console and doing. "xinit ccsm -- :1"

2008-03-07T19:24:00.000Z	anolis	Lacrymology	that will start a new X session running only the configuration manager
2008-03-07T19:25:00.000Z	Lacrymology	anolis	I killed compiz, and reconfigured before starting it. Now all's fine
