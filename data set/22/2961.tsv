2009-02-10T14:06:00.000Z	alfons_		can anyone help me wit this: I cannot write to some of my harddisks anymore. Logged in as user, but as root I everything works ok.
2009-02-10T14:07:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	what format is the drive?
2009-02-10T14:10:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	there are in the ACLs of the files on the drive
2009-02-10T14:10:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	with every filesystem
2009-02-10T14:11:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	, access control list
2009-02-10T14:12:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	do: ls -al /path/to/disk    to see the current permissions of a directory/file
2009-02-10T14:12:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	to change permissions see:  man chmod   and  man chown
2009-02-10T14:13:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	but it doesn't really apply to formats such as fat or NTFS
2009-02-10T14:13:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	because the ACLs of linux and windows are different
2009-02-10T14:14:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	what format if the drive?
2009-02-10T14:15:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	sudo chown -R youruser:youruser /path/to/drive
2009-02-10T14:15:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	yes
2009-02-10T14:19:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	no.....
2009-02-10T14:21:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	yeah, that usually toastes an OS
2009-02-10T14:21:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	well, it comes up occassionaly on the forums
2009-02-10T14:22:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	the general consesus is reinstall
2009-02-10T14:22:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	careful running commands that you are unsure about, especially as root
2009-02-10T14:23:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	what you did was change the owner of ever file
2009-02-10T14:23:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	many files, applications, services, daemons, etc depend on certain permissions to function properly
2009-02-10T14:23:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	it may or may not start up
2009-02-10T14:25:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	excellent
2009-02-10T14:25:00.000Z	Titan8990	alfons_	most people don't backup
