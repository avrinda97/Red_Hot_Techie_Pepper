2008-11-01T17:08:00.000Z	LjL	Durayne	how did you install that driver?
2008-11-01T17:09:00.000Z	Durayne	LjL	I downloaded the package from realtek, then unpacked it and dragged the install.sh into the terminal
2008-11-01T17:10:00.000Z	LjL	Durayne	installing drivers that way is generally a bad idea, were you sure that your card wasn't "supposed" to work with standard Ubuntu drivers? because if so, that should have been the route to follow
2008-11-01T17:10:00.000Z	LjL	Durayne	anyway, now, i think what might have happened is that there is a kernel module that causes your machine to hang
2008-11-01T17:11:00.000Z	LjL	Durayne	you should boot from a live CD (if you can't make your normal Ubuntu work at all, even in recovery mode) and find that module
2008-11-01T17:11:00.000Z	Durayne	LjL	actually i can move my mouse and so but the rest of the screen is black
2008-11-01T17:11:00.000Z	LjL	Durayne	can you go to a virtual terminal by hitting ctrl+alt+f1?
2008-11-01T17:12:00.000Z	Durayne	LjL	didnt try that, can i also repair that module with hardy cd if i use intrepid now
2008-11-01T17:34:00.000Z	Durayne	LjL	i can access with ctrl alt f1
2008-11-01T17:37:00.000Z	Durayne	LjL	u mean i should start with my ubuntu cd
2008-11-01T17:38:00.000Z	LjL	Durayne	if you can access that, you can try fixing it from there. but to do that, you need to find out what module the driver installed. try doing "lsmod", and see if there is anything that looks like your card's driver
2008-11-01T18:19:00.000Z	Durayne	LjL	hi again is there a possibility that lsmod writes per page (like in dos der command /p)
2008-11-01T18:20:00.000Z	LjL	Durayne	"lsmod | more"
2008-11-01T18:20:00.000Z	LjL	Durayne	(that applies to all commands)
2008-11-01T18:28:00.000Z	Durayne	LjL	the only things that even looked like it were soundcore and output
2008-11-01T18:29:00.000Z	Durayne	LjL	if u want i can send you the programmcode of the install.sh
2008-11-01T18:42:00.000Z	Durayne	LjL	: If I dl the new Ubuntu and burn it on cd, then install it completely new (manual and choose the partition linux is on right now) the other partitions should be unaffected or?
2008-11-01T19:47:00.000Z	Durayne	LjL	: the only things that look like a sounddriver are soundcore and output
2008-11-01T20:07:00.000Z	Durayne	LjL	: i couldnt see anything expect soundcore and output that looked like the driver i installed
2008-11-01T20:08:00.000Z	LjL	Durayne	i don't know thenm
2008-11-01T20:09:00.000Z	Durayne	LjL	: would it help u if I sent you the programm code of the install.sh?
2008-11-01T20:09:00.000Z	LjL	Durayne	can try
