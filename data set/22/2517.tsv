2009-05-28T21:30:00.000Z	BeatlesFan		hey all
2009-05-28T21:32:00.000Z	IHS_Intern	BeatlesFan	still on AGP? I quite recently moved away from it, myself.
2009-05-28T21:33:00.000Z	BeatlesFan	IHS_Intern	yeah, AGP for now...
2009-05-28T21:33:00.000Z	BeatlesFan	IHS_Intern	at least it's better than my onboard Intel graphics
2009-05-28T21:33:00.000Z	BeatlesFan	IHS_Intern	hopefully I won't have issues installing the card
2009-05-28T21:33:00.000Z	BeatlesFan	IHS_Intern	I'm new to Ubuntu
2009-05-28T21:34:00.000Z	IHS_Intern		The problem with moving away from AGP, or anything, when on a tight budget.. is you have to buy all the parts separate... I went 3 months on a VIA Chrome 9 Dx
2009-05-28T21:34:00.000Z	BeatlesFan	IHS_Intern	I don't have PCI-e in this MB.. so I'd have to upgrade that first
2009-05-28T21:34:00.000Z	BeatlesFan	IHS_Intern	I have 3 PCI slots, one AGP 8x slot
2009-05-28T21:36:00.000Z	IHS_Intern	BeatlesFan	Nvidia has good linux support, and ubuntu automates things... Not sure where the recent removal of old chips support cuts off, though. I'd think 5 and up would be fine., BeatlesFan I had no AGP slot, 3 PCI slots, and DDR RAM. So I got a new motherboard, then a CPU, then a Gig of RAM, one at a time....eventually got a real nice system, but that Via Chrome 9 was horrible until I got the new videocard, wh
2009-05-28T21:36:00.000Z	IHS_Intern		ich Ubuntu 8.04-8.10 wouldn't boot on...
2009-05-28T21:37:00.000Z	BeatlesFan	IHS_Intern	sounds like what I'm doing.. one component at a time
2009-05-28T21:37:00.000Z	BeatlesFan	IHS_Intern	great buys on Ebay for a lot of this stuff
2009-05-28T21:38:00.000Z	IHS_Intern	BeatlesFan	an AGP video card isn't a good choice for that 1 component at a time, because you can't take it with you to the new motherboard.
2009-05-28T21:38:00.000Z	BeatlesFan	IHS_Intern	right, but by then everything I have will be antique and I'll start again
2009-05-28T21:39:00.000Z	BeatlesFan	IHS_Intern	last night I figured out how to move my /home dir to another partition...
2009-05-28T21:39:00.000Z	BeatlesFan	IHS_Intern	and installed a new 250GB hard drive
2009-05-28T21:40:00.000Z	IHS_Intern	BeatlesFan	nah, PCI-E isn't going anywhere for a while, perhaps the motherboard and socket it's on will drop from it's current "high end" unless you go AMD, which is still behind intel's high end. I went for the middle, which will stay supported for a nice long while.
2009-05-28T21:40:00.000Z	BeatlesFan	IHS_Intern	right
2009-05-28T21:41:00.000Z	IHS_Intern		"Previous attempts at booting this system have failed at checkpoint [Oops]   um...wth, dell?
2009-05-28T21:42:00.000Z	BeatlesFan		anyone familiar with VPNC and remote desktop?
2009-05-28T21:46:00.000Z	BeatlesFan	IHS_Intern	do you think it's worth it to try to sell my old 40GB hard drive or just chuck it?
