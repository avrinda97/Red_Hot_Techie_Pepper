2012-11-09T15:52:00.000Z	nicekiwi	dr_willis	any idea why a program being run as root couldnt create files or folders within /tmp?
2012-11-09T15:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	nicekiwi	 / getting mounted read only due to fsck errors.. is one possibility
2012-11-09T15:53:00.000Z	nicekiwi	dr_willis	hmm.. could be.. any way I could correct that? ls-l says the permissions are drwxrwxrwt root root
2012-11-09T15:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	nicekiwi	 can you make a file in / ? your  /tmp/ is not mounted to some tmpfs thing is it?  (mine is)
2012-11-09T15:56:00.000Z	nicekiwi	dr_willis	well well, it says its read only. (Ive booted in recovery mode to root console)
2012-11-09T15:57:00.000Z	nicekiwi	dr_willis	how can I correct this? Ive checked/repaired the disk in Gparted from live CD and it didnt really seem to chnage anything
2012-11-09T15:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	nicekiwi	 by default i think the recovery console does that. theres some option i thought in the recovery menus to remount it rw, or you can use the remount option to mount.
2012-11-09T15:58:00.000Z	nicekiwi	dr_willis	hmm l
2012-11-09T15:59:00.000Z	nicekiwi	dr_willis	oh yeah... it says it wants to re-mount in RW.. but it just sits for ages and wont actually do it
2012-11-09T16:01:00.000Z	nicekiwi	dr_willis	this seemed to happen after the system frooze up during a file tranfer and i had to reboot.
2012-11-09T16:02:00.000Z	nicekiwi	dr_willis	i just want to install nvidia drivers :'(
2012-11-09T16:03:00.000Z	nicekiwi	dr_willis	how do I fix it?
2012-11-09T16:04:00.000Z	nicekiwi	dr_willis	how do i do that from a live usb?
2012-11-09T16:07:00.000Z	nicekiwi	dr_willis	ok, ive done that... took supprisingly short amount of time..
2012-11-09T16:09:00.000Z	nicekiwi	dr_willis	text only mode isnt there though..
2012-11-09T16:11:00.000Z	nicekiwi	dr_willis	and it hangs while going to RW again..
2012-11-09T16:14:00.000Z	nicekiwi	dr_willis	its an SSD i'll be majorly pissed if its dying..
2012-11-09T16:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	nicekiwi	 ive not herad much about lifespan or reliabilty of ssd's
2012-11-09T16:53:00.000Z	nicekiwi	dr_willis	tried what you suggested. Normal GUI login followed
