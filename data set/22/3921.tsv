2008-05-08T09:27:00.000Z	vbman11	Flannel	I got an error "svn: Unknown hostname 'svn.banshee-project.org'"
2008-05-08T09:28:00.000Z	Flannel	vbman11	doing which command?
2008-05-08T09:28:00.000Z	vbman11	Flannel	svn co svn://svn.banshee-project.org/trunk/banshee-itunes-plugin
2008-05-08T09:29:00.000Z	Flannel	vbman11	unknown hostname means svn can't resolve that address, and I can't either.  Its definately a problem on their end (or an old address)
2008-05-08T09:29:00.000Z	vbman11	Flannel	it is suposed to be a banshee plugin
2008-05-08T09:29:00.000Z	Flannel	vbman11	Shouldn't it be http://svn.gnome.org/svn/banshee/trunk/banshee ?
2008-05-08T09:30:00.000Z	Flannel	vbman11	libipod device?  ipodsharp?
2008-05-08T09:30:00.000Z	vbman11	Flannel	that is"itunes store"
2008-05-08T09:31:00.000Z	vbman11	Flannel	with out the "that is"
2008-05-08T09:32:00.000Z	Flannel	vbman11	Looks like its defunct, it was aleady unmaintained.  If you'll have any luck, it'll be through asking the banshee people where the repos might've gone
2008-05-08T09:32:00.000Z	vbman11	Flannel	check out this page "http://banshee-project.org/PluginRepository"
2008-05-08T09:33:00.000Z	Flannel	vbman11	right, it's not there.  Ask the banshee people.  It may be that they cleaned up unmaintained plugins, I have no idea.
2008-05-08T09:33:00.000Z	vbman11	Flannel	k thanks!
2008-05-16T04:59:00.000Z	vbman11	Flannel	Thanks
2008-05-16T05:03:00.000Z	vbman11	Flannel	wait a sec, this isn't source, it is an application
2008-05-16T05:04:00.000Z	Flannel	vbman11	just extract it into /usr/local/[wherever its stuff goes]
2008-05-16T05:05:00.000Z	vbman11	Flannel	Thats all?
2008-05-16T05:05:00.000Z	Flannel	vbman11	more or less, yeah.
2008-05-16T05:05:00.000Z	vbman11	Flannel	what else?
2008-05-16T05:06:00.000Z	Flannel	vbman11	probably a good idea to remove it if you've installed it in package management
2008-05-16T05:07:00.000Z	vbman11	Flannel	K, Thanks!
