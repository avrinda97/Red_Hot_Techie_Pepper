2009-12-30T02:32:00.000Z	thevor	inferno_daulXEON	I'm just trying to connect to a friend, but having problems.
2009-12-30T02:32:00.000Z	inferno_daulXEON	thevor	what kind of problems? Can't get your belt off? or having issues with blocked ports
2009-12-30T02:34:00.000Z	inferno_daulXEON	thevor	skype doesn't see other users at all? but it recognized your cam?
2009-12-30T02:36:00.000Z	inferno_daulXEON	thevor	can you use usernames? its easier for people to read when thier screen is spammed with text.  BTW wtf are you using empathy for
2009-12-30T02:37:00.000Z	thevor	inferno_daulXEON	I am just trying out empathy because I wanted to check out the video chat, I usually use piding.
2009-12-30T02:37:00.000Z	thevor	inferno_daulXEON	pidgin
2009-12-30T02:38:00.000Z	inferno_daulXEON	thevor	- thanks, but yea empathy has given me nothing but problems... search around for other progs.
2009-12-30T02:38:00.000Z	thevor	inferno_daulXEON	Ya so far I don't care for it at all.
2009-12-30T02:38:00.000Z	thevor	inferno_daulXEON	btw I am fairly new to xchat, is this text popping up red for you? Because yours pops up as red for me when you're talking to me.
2009-12-30T02:40:00.000Z	inferno_daulXEON	thevor	if I was on xchat it would be a different color for me if you type my name

2009-12-30T02:41:00.000Z	thevor	inferno_daulXEON	Do you know of any im clients that support video chat other than empathy? I know pidgin has no plans to.
