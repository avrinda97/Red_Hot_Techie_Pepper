2009-09-09T21:33:00.000Z	nirvette		and now can anyone help me get some sounds on the damn thing now?
2009-09-09T21:34:00.000Z	Ileden	nirvette	program called "testdisk" saved me a lot of data I thought lost
2009-09-09T21:36:00.000Z	Ileden	nirvette	it's available from ubuntu repositories - just use synaptic packet manager (or add/remove programs) to get it
2009-09-09T21:37:00.000Z	Ileden	nirvette	you can also download it from http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk
2009-09-09T21:37:00.000Z	Ileden	nirvette	but it's not the most easiest to use, unfortunately
2009-09-09T21:38:00.000Z	Ileden	nirvette	probably worth to check out the live-cd's too: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Livecd
2009-09-09T21:40:00.000Z	Ileden	nirvette	testdisk isn't the most impossible program I've had to use either. with reading some instuctions, you can get far
2009-09-09T22:11:00.000Z	Ileden	nirvette	linux isn't really any more hard than windows, but the type of help you get for windows is often a lot less technical. (the problem is getting it, though...)
2009-09-09T22:13:00.000Z	Ileden	nirvette	a lot of your data seems disapperaed. undertsandable. if you have a friend that's more computer-savvy, you might suggest to her/him to try using TestDisk on your computer - maybe she/he can recover the data.
2009-09-09T22:14:00.000Z	Ileden	nirvette	there isn't really much more I can help though IRC. :-/
2009-09-09T22:15:00.000Z	Ileden	nirvette	guiding through TestDisk (where to run it, what to do with it, what to recover, etc) is really something one would have to be at your computer to do...
2009-09-09T22:16:00.000Z	Ileden	nirvette	also, I don't recommend using the same computer that contained the data you want to recover.
2009-09-09T22:16:00.000Z	Ileden	nirvette	or rather, the same hard disk.
2009-09-09T22:17:00.000Z	Ileden	nirvette	well, irc really doesn't matter
2009-09-09T22:17:00.000Z	Ileden	nirvette	just don't go downloading huge files and such.
2009-09-09T22:19:00.000Z	Ileden	nirvette	since the system doesn't know about the lost data anymore, it won't know how to avoid messing it up. The idea is that the data is still there, but the system doesn't know where, so it might accidentally step on it during writes to hard disk
