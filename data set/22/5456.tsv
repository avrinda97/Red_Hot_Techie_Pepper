2007-06-14T08:27:00.000Z	crdlb	scales11	yikes, why?
2007-06-14T08:29:00.000Z	scales11	crdlb	because i am having trouble connecting to hidden networks and my signal isnt read as a percent
2007-06-14T08:29:00.000Z	crdlb	scales11	you really think ndiswrapper will work better than madwifi?
2007-06-14T08:30:00.000Z	crdlb	scales11	however you can disable madwifi in your /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common
2007-06-14T08:30:00.000Z	scales11	crdlb	i am not sure but i would like to try.
2007-06-14T08:31:00.000Z	scales11	crdlb	ok how do i disable it?
2007-06-14T08:31:00.000Z	crdlb	scales11	have you seen any success from other people?
2007-06-14T08:31:00.000Z	scales11	crdlb	ha, just one
2007-06-14T08:31:00.000Z	crdlb	scales11	it's pretty simple, just set DISABLED_MODULES="madwifi"
2007-06-14T08:32:00.000Z	crdlb	scales11	err I take that back
2007-06-14T08:32:00.000Z	scales11	crdlb	ok, i will give it a shot.  my second question is gonna be how to i install the drivers with ndiswrapper
2007-06-14T08:32:00.000Z	crdlb	scales11	no idea
2007-06-14T08:33:00.000Z	crdlb	scales11	you should add ath_hal to DISABLED_MODULES
2007-06-14T08:35:00.000Z	crdlb	scales11	^^ see
2007-06-14T08:44:00.000Z	scales11	crdlb	ok sorry there is just so many messages i couldnt keep up
2007-06-14T08:44:00.000Z	crdlb	scales11	I strongly recommend not using ndiswrapper
2007-06-14T08:48:00.000Z	scales11	crdlb	humm, well is there any other option i have? i cannot connect to hidden networks, and the wireless doesnt seem to work all the time, sometimes it just connects
2007-06-14T08:48:00.000Z	crdlb	scales11	why do you turn off ssid broadcast?
2007-06-14T08:48:00.000Z	crdlb	scales11	that provides absolutely no security and breaks the wifi protocol
2007-06-14T08:48:00.000Z	scales11	crdlb	well, i just did
2007-06-14T08:21:00.000Z	scales11	crdlb	you around?
