2012-02-03T14:57:00.000Z	theadmin	artao	You can
2012-02-03T14:57:00.000Z	artao	theadmin	i CAN run it off usb key?
2012-02-03T14:58:00.000Z	theadmin	artao	Yeah, just use LiLi USB Creator (from Windows) or usb-creator-gtk (from Ubuntu-like Linux) or Unetbootin (from any Linux, but it sometimes fails)
2012-02-03T14:59:00.000Z	theadmin	artao	Yeah, I don't think that really works
2012-02-03T15:02:00.000Z	theadmin	artao	Ubuntu Studio uses gnome if I recall right
2012-02-03T15:03:00.000Z	theadmin	artao	You just need to install the one you need from APT and then change on the login screen -_-
2012-02-03T15:14:00.000Z	theadmin	artao	Window manager
2012-02-03T15:14:00.000Z	theadmin	artao	DMs are login screens. DEs are window managers AND a set of some application.
2012-02-03T15:15:00.000Z	theadmin	artao	And a window manager is just the thing which draws the window borders
2012-02-03T15:16:00.000Z	theadmin	artao	No, window managers don't deal with gadgets
2012-02-03T15:17:00.000Z	theadmin	artao	Desktop environments. Such as Gnome, KDE, etc
2012-02-03T15:17:00.000Z	theadmin	artao	E17 is more of a desktop environment than a window manager nowadays :D
2012-02-03T15:18:00.000Z	theadmin	artao	Try using lxrandr
2012-02-03T15:18:00.000Z	theadmin	artao	lxrandr, it's a tool for easy monitor configuration, universal pretty much
