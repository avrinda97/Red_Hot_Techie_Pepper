2008-08-04T17:43:00.000Z	Vexiq		Why do I not have sound in Ubuntu? :/
2008-08-04T17:44:00.000Z	Slart	Vexiq	no speakers? no sound card? speakers not connected? computer not on? you're not playing any sound? drivers need to be installed/configured? volume is set to 0? that's just a few answers
2008-08-04T18:09:00.000Z	Vexiq	Slart	Still having sound problems. I've come across "Add current user to the sound group". But it says audio:x:29:pulse,maurice (Maurice being my username ofcourse ;).
2008-08-04T18:10:00.000Z	Slart	Vexiq	looks like you already are in the sound group then
2008-08-04T18:10:00.000Z	Vexiq	Slart	But the guide says it should say "Root"
2008-08-04T18:10:00.000Z	Slart	Vexiq	is it an ubuntu guide?
2008-08-04T18:10:00.000Z	Vexiq	Slart	I got linked here by someone http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=205449
2008-08-04T18:11:00.000Z	Vexiq	Slart	But nothing seems to work for me
2008-08-04T18:12:00.000Z	Slart	Vexiq	that guide isn't really up to date.. I wouldn't worry about that part
2008-08-04T18:12:00.000Z	Slart	Vexiq	the important thing is that your username is listed.. no the other usernames on the same line
2008-08-04T18:14:00.000Z	Vexiq	Slart	Where can I see I have the right drivers in Ubuntu?
2008-08-04T18:15:00.000Z	Slart	Vexiq	run this in a terminal, "cat /proc/asound/cards" , it should print out a list of your soundcards.. if it doesn't you might need to install drivers
2008-08-04T18:16:00.000Z	Vexiq	Slart	It shows my soundcard and my headset (Intel ICH5 and a Creative HS)
2008-08-04T18:17:00.000Z	Slart	Vexiq	then the drivers are fine
2008-08-04T18:20:00.000Z	Vexiq	Slart	I'm not sure if it's useful but https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/163111 .. could it have something to do with that?
2008-08-04T18:20:00.000Z	Slart	Vexiq	it might
2008-08-04T18:26:00.000Z	Vexiq	Slart	If I choose USB audo in the sound settings I can a beep
2008-08-04T18:27:00.000Z	Slart	Vexiq	well.. then the soundcard actually works.. no need to think about drivers and such then
2008-08-04T18:35:00.000Z	Vexiq	Slart	Getting closer... sound from media player now but not from flash and the like
2008-08-05T01:32:00.000Z	Slart	Vexiq	are you using pulseaudio? have you install paman, pavucontrol and padevchooser?
2008-08-05T01:32:00.000Z	Slart	Vexiq	have you set the system, preferences, audio to all use pulseaudio?
2008-08-05T01:32:00.000Z	Vexiq	Slart	no I dont pulseaudio cause that didnt work at all. I did USB Audio to actually get some sound, if I pick something else it just totally stops working alltogether. And indeed debian_akroyd
