2011-09-16T06:34:00.000Z	hottwotrot		does anyone have any idea why I can reach my apache server within my LAN but not from outside? I have the port forwarding set up correctly
2011-09-16T06:35:00.000Z	metabill	hottwotrot	it might not bind to the correct IP then. did you configure the vhost yet?
2011-09-16T06:44:00.000Z	hottwotrot	metabill	sorry about that i was away from the computer, no I did not, what is that?
2011-09-16T06:47:00.000Z	metabill	hottwotrot	if there is no vhost configured, you might not have any luck. please make sure apache2 listens on the ip that is being forwarded to
2011-09-16T06:47:00.000Z	hottwotrot	metabill	where do I see what ip apache listens to?
2011-09-16T06:50:00.000Z	metabill	hottwotrot	you can try reading the apache config file, or use apache2ctl -t -D DUMP_VHOSTS
2011-09-16T06:53:00.000Z	hottwotrot	metabill	this is one of my qualms with apache, there are MANY config files BUT looking at /etc/apache2/apache2.conf it looks like everything in the sites-enabled directory should be, I guess, virtual hosts, and the only thing is there is the default setup... whcih I thought would work?
2011-09-16T06:54:00.000Z	metabill	hottwotrot	there is also a ports.conf file. make sure you listen on the port that is forwarded to. :)
2011-09-16T06:55:00.000Z	metabill	hottwotrot	netstat will help to see whether your apache will listen on any interface (not just localhost)
2011-09-16T06:58:00.000Z	hottwotrot	metabill	what should I be looking for in netstat? Is there a convenient netstat |grep ***** that will show me the exactly line you want me to see?
2011-09-16T06:59:00.000Z	metabill	hottwotrot	netstat -an | grep apache
2011-09-16T07:00:00.000Z	hottwotrot	metabill	unix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     4741204  /var/run/apache2/cgisock.15154
2011-09-16T07:01:00.000Z	metabill	hottwotrot	i believe apache isn't listening at all on a port
2011-09-16T07:02:00.000Z	metabill	hottwotrot	can you see the default files (It works!) from the localhost?
2011-09-16T07:02:00.000Z	hottwotrot	metabill	that I can see
2011-09-16T07:03:00.000Z	hottwotrot	metabill	just can't se that from OUTSIDE the network
2011-09-16T07:03:00.000Z	metabill	hottwotrot	sorry, netstat -anp | grep apache  then )
2011-09-16T07:03:00.000Z	metabill	hottwotrot	missing an option there the first time
2011-09-16T07:04:00.000Z	hottwotrot	metabill	unix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     4741204  -                   /var/run/apache2/cgisock.15154
2011-09-16T07:06:00.000Z	metabill	hottwotrot	did you run it with -anp ?
2011-09-16T07:07:00.000Z	hottwotrot	metabill	I did, i jsut copied and pasted
2011-09-16T07:09:00.000Z	metabill	hottwotrot	how did you check from the outside, though?
