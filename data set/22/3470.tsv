2008-08-24T22:25:00.000Z	jrockpunk1		this is full
2008-08-24T22:25:00.000Z	jrockpunk1		Is anyone here that can give me an answer to something please?
2008-08-24T22:26:00.000Z	jrockpunk1		ok ill just ask
2008-08-24T22:27:00.000Z	jrockpunk1		can anyone tell me how I would download and install a driver for my wireless card on ubuntu?
2008-08-24T22:27:00.000Z	jrockpunk1		I cant find any drivers for linux
2008-08-24T22:27:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	which wireless chipset?
2008-08-24T22:27:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	again, which wireless chipset?
2008-08-24T22:28:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	that's not a chipset
2008-08-24T22:28:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	lspci or lsusb (depends on how the card is connected)
2008-08-24T22:29:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	that does not help
2008-08-24T22:30:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	what do you mean by "mini card"? minipci or cardbus or express card?
2008-08-24T22:31:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	if you cannot even tell the difference between minipci and cardbus, it's gonna be hard
2008-08-24T22:32:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	that's not the lspci output
2008-08-24T22:33:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	but guessing from the mac address of wlan0, it's a intel card
2008-08-24T22:33:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	it doesn't show up on lspci. must be a usb device
2008-08-24T22:33:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	try lsusb
2008-08-24T22:34:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	why not just run the live cd?
2008-08-24T22:35:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	only lsusb
2008-08-24T22:36:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	internal wifi cards CAN be usb
2008-08-24T22:36:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	and lol isn't helping at all
2008-08-24T22:40:00.000Z	rtz3673	jrockpunk1	i don't use windows at all, but the details in device manage should give you some vendor/product id (two four digit hex values)
