2009-09-30T05:38:00.000Z	brianV	Pelo	it's a GTS250, so I am pretty sure 180 does it
2009-09-30T05:29:00.000Z	Pelo	brianV	how are you installing the nvidia driver ?
2009-09-30T05:31:00.000Z	brianV	Pelo	ctmjr: Using the restricted drivers manager
2009-09-30T05:32:00.000Z	Pelo	brianV	why are you playing around in xorg.conf ?
2009-09-30T05:32:00.000Z	brianV	Pelo	I am not
2009-09-30T05:32:00.000Z	Pelo	brianV	what with the nv vs nvidia then ?
2009-09-30T05:33:00.000Z	brianV	Pelo	because I've been using nvidia cards for 10 years, and know the drivers
2009-09-30T05:34:00.000Z	brianV	Pelo	any suggestions? Or just an accusation?
2009-09-30T05:34:00.000Z	Pelo	brianV	ok I'M a bit confused,  you install the driver using the restricted driver manager and it works, then you cange nv for nvidia and it stops working , why are you changing nv for nvidia ( or the other way aroudn)
2009-09-30T05:35:00.000Z	Pelo	brianV	I'M not making accusations, I'm just trying to understand the problem , I'm helping several ppl and doing my own stuff as well , I thought I understood your issue but clearly I don'T
2009-09-30T05:35:00.000Z	brianV	Pelo	Ubuntu has nv to begin with, right? if I install the nvidia driver with the restricted driver manager, I can't boot into X. I need to boot in recovermode, select the 'fix X graphics' or whatever link, then I can log in again
2009-09-30T05:36:00.000Z	brianV	Pelo	my apologies. I guess it's hard to judge intent across an IRC chat line
2009-09-30T05:36:00.000Z	Pelo	brianV	ahhhhh.
2009-09-30T05:37:00.000Z	Pelo	brianV	your card may not be supported with the driver you are trying to use, try to select the 173 or the 96 one
2009-09-30T05:38:00.000Z	brianV	Pelo	perhaps not. EnvyNG suggests the 180 driver supports it, though
2009-09-30T05:39:00.000Z	brianV	Pelo	I am on 64-bit - would that change anything?
2009-09-30T05:39:00.000Z	Pelo	brianV	I don'T know what works on what off the top of my head,  you might want to take a look on the nvidia.com website,
2009-09-30T05:40:00.000Z	Pelo	brianV	my neighbour also has an issue with the nvidia drivers this was cause by her crappy mobo , with an via chipset on it
2009-09-30T05:40:00.000Z	brianV	Pelo	hm... this mobo worked in the past with a Geforce 7300 GS
2009-09-30T05:41:00.000Z	Pelo	brianV	I'M just brainstroming here
2009-09-30T05:41:00.000Z	Pelo	brianV	might also want to ask in #nvidia
2009-09-30T05:41:00.000Z	brianV	Pelo	it's truly appreciated. I am just evaluating the suggestions as the come out
