2007-04-21T14:35:00.000Z	calculator		can someone recommend a windows xp freeware program to burn a ubuntu Iso file onto a cd?
2007-04-21T14:35:00.000Z	underwatercow	calculator	you might try magicISO
2007-04-21T14:36:00.000Z	calculator	underwatercow	thanks
2007-04-21T14:42:00.000Z	calculator	underwatercow	i have gotten magiciso
2007-04-21T14:42:00.000Z	calculator	underwatercow	have you used it?
2007-04-21T14:42:00.000Z	underwatercow	calculator	I have, but it's been a while
2007-04-21T14:43:00.000Z	underwatercow	calculator	doesn't it let you burn from a preexisting iso?
2007-04-21T14:43:00.000Z	calculator	underwatercow	i don't understand your quesntion
2007-04-21T14:44:00.000Z	underwatercow	calculator	you have already downloaded the ISO for ubuntu, right?
2007-04-21T14:44:00.000Z	calculator	underwatercow	yes, i have
2007-04-21T14:44:00.000Z	underwatercow	calculator	look for an option in magicISO to burn an image to disc
2007-04-21T14:45:00.000Z	underwatercow	calculator	I don't remember if there are size restrictions on burning or not though
2007-04-21T14:45:00.000Z	underwatercow	calculator	looks like a good choice to me
2007-04-21T14:46:00.000Z	calculator	underwatercow	but the tutorial at  http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-burniso.htm doesn't use that button. please take a look at the link
2007-04-21T14:46:00.000Z	underwatercow	calculator	one sec
2007-04-21T14:48:00.000Z	underwatercow	calculator	well, you want it to be bootable for sure
2007-04-21T14:48:00.000Z	underwatercow	calculator	lol... you should just be able to burn it to a disc and have it boot
2007-04-21T14:49:00.000Z	underwatercow	calculator	let me look over the directions quick... not done yet
2007-04-21T14:49:00.000Z	calculator	underwatercow	maybe, i should follow http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-makebootablecd.htm
2007-04-21T14:51:00.000Z	underwatercow	calculator	just click the option to burn from iso. I think that should work fine.
2007-04-21T14:53:00.000Z	calculator	underwatercow	there is a button that says "burn cd/dvid with ISO", but no button that says "burn cd/dvd from ISO".
2007-04-21T14:53:00.000Z	underwatercow	calculator	try that one
