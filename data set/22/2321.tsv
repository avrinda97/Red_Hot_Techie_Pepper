2009-09-04T01:37:00.000Z	Berzerker	ShapeShifter499	do you still have the recovery partition?
2009-09-04T01:38:00.000Z	Berzerker		lol...
2009-09-04T01:38:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Berzerker	yes
2009-09-04T01:38:00.000Z	Berzerker	ShapeShifter499	then what's the problem?
2009-09-04T01:39:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Berzerker	grub blocks the recovery partition from erasing and reinstalling windows
2009-09-04T01:39:00.000Z	Berzerker	ShapeShifter499	grub blocks it?
2009-09-04T01:39:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Berzerker	correctly
2009-09-04T01:39:00.000Z	Berzerker	ShapeShifter499	how does grub block it?
2009-09-04T01:40:00.000Z	Berzerker	ShapeShifter499	can you get into the recovery partition to attempt to reinstall?
2009-09-04T01:40:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Berzerker	yes
2009-09-04T01:41:00.000Z	Berzerker	ShapeShifter499	did you try a FIXMBR?
2009-09-04T01:41:00.000Z	Berzerker	ShapeShifter499	entering the recovery console from the windows installation and typing "fixmbr"
2009-09-04T01:41:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Berzerker	don't have a windows partition
2009-09-04T01:42:00.000Z	Berzerker	ShapeShifter499	I mean the recovery partition
2009-09-04T01:42:00.000Z	Berzerker	ShapeShifter499	when you enter the recovery partition, instead of trying to reinstall windows, enter the recovery console by pressing "R" (you should see an option for it along the way), and type "fixmbr" (without quotes) at the prompt, then answer Y (yes) to the question.
2009-09-04T01:43:00.000Z	Berzerker	ShapeShifter499	then try to reinstall windows again.
2009-09-04T01:43:00.000Z	Berzerker	ShapeShifter499	I need to be afk for a while, but if you're still here in like 45 min, i'll come help you again.
2009-09-04T01:43:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Berzerker	no option for recovery console, just one for install, and one for restore from backup on a disk(cd/dvd)
2009-09-04T01:44:00.000Z	Berzerker	ShapeShifter499	so it's a proprietary reinstallation software...
2009-09-04T01:44:00.000Z	Berzerker	ShapeShifter499	try to get your hands on an external CD drive with a copy of XP, that will have it on it.
2009-09-04T01:44:00.000Z	Berzerker	ShapeShifter499	I need to go.
2009-09-04T01:44:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	Berzerker	ok
