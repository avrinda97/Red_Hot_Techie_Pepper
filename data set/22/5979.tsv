2007-02-11T07:05:00.000Z	linxeh		I have 8GB of swap on an 8GB box, and find I need that much
2007-02-11T07:06:00.000Z	linxeh		any idea what to do on a 64GB box ?
2007-02-11T07:07:00.000Z	cypherdelic	linxeh	KB, GB, MB even do NOT exist
2007-02-11T07:07:00.000Z	linxeh	cypherdelic	eh ?
2007-02-11T07:08:00.000Z	linxeh	cypherdelic	both the SI and the IEC recommend that 1GB = 1000 MB = 1000,000 KB etc
2007-02-11T07:08:00.000Z	linxeh	cypherdelic	those are alternative units. KB and MB do exist and are in common usage.
2007-02-11T07:10:00.000Z	cypherdelic	linxeh	KiBI is the official, Mb is a marketing gag
2007-02-11T07:10:00.000Z	cypherdelic	linxeh	its standard because the industry defines it as standard, but it is mathematicaly incorrect
2007-02-11T07:11:00.000Z	linxeh	cypherdelic	one kilogram = 1000 grams. one kilobyte = 1000 bytes
2007-02-11T07:11:00.000Z	cypherdelic	linxeh	no
2007-02-11T07:13:00.000Z	cypherdelic	linxeh	i dont care, you count a binary system the decimal way, that is incorrect
2007-02-11T07:15:00.000Z	linxeh	cypherdelic	the SI and IEC units (MiB etc) count them in a binary way. 1MiB = 1024KiB. if you use conventional notation you risk confusion with those outside the field. it is unreasonable to expect a mathematician or physicist to know that the computer field is bent backwards and uses distorted terminology
2007-02-11T07:15:00.000Z	cypherdelic	linxeh	no the others confusing me, i only use KiB
2007-02-11T07:16:00.000Z	linxeh	cypherdelic	ahh - likewise. I only describe binary systems in the SI units, otherwise it is confusing
2007-02-11T07:17:00.000Z	cypherdelic	linxeh	never mind, think the only usage of KB is a good selling strategy, in my point of view 1000 is completely senseless
2007-02-11T07:18:00.000Z	linxeh	cypherdelic	yeah, definitely - its a marketing strategy though i guess
2007-02-17T17:45:00.000Z	linxeh	cypherdelic	actually a lot of the MS source isnt that bad
2007-02-17T17:45:00.000Z	cypherdelic	linxeh	but it isnt that good, either :)
2007-02-17T17:45:00.000Z	linxeh	cypherdelic	no, but nor is most open source code
2007-02-17T17:46:00.000Z	linxeh	cypherdelic	if something goes wrong on windows I phone MS and they will often send someone out
2007-02-17T17:47:00.000Z	linxeh	cypherdelic	well, we have a large support contract with Microsoft, Sun, HP and Redhat
2007-02-17T17:47:00.000Z	cypherdelic	linxeh	 of course, money holding companys will arrive good support
