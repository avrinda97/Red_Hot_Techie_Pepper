2010-11-24T15:01:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Diverdude	If you don't have any other video capture device connected (webcam, etc) then it means that your card is detected
2010-11-24T15:01:00.000Z	Diverdude	bilalakhtar	aha thats nice at least....there is only graphic card
2010-11-24T15:02:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Diverdude	Congrats, your card is detected!
2010-11-24T15:02:00.000Z	bilalakhtar		Card above means TV tuner card
2010-11-24T15:02:00.000Z	Diverdude	bilalakhtar	you see its been years since i bought this computer...Do you have any idea if ubuntu also detects type and model etc?
2010-11-24T15:02:00.000Z	Diverdude	bilalakhtar	of the tv tuner card
2010-11-24T15:03:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Diverdude	it must be doing that, but for that you will need tools that would check that
2010-11-24T15:03:00.000Z	bilalakhtar		and I can't think of any in that sort :(
2010-11-24T15:03:00.000Z	Diverdude	bilalakhtar	i was thinking about a command similar to lspci
2010-11-24T15:04:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Diverdude	Doesn't lspci do it?
2010-11-24T15:05:00.000Z	Diverdude	bilalakhtar	hmm actually lspci shows: Multimedia video controller: Conexant Systems, Inc. CX23880/1/2/3 PCI Video and Audio Decoder  and Multimedia controller: Conexant Systems, Inc. CX23880/1/2/3 PCI Video and Audio Decoder [Audio Port]
2010-11-24T15:05:00.000Z	Diverdude	bilalakhtar	i wonder if it is any of those
2010-11-24T15:07:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Diverdude	could you pastebin the whole output of lspci?
