2008-04-29T06:41:00.000Z	ariqs		is there  a less spammy ubuntu help channel?
2008-04-29T06:42:00.000Z	ariqs		I can't get my modem setup in ubuntu to connect to the internet. I tried every setup there was in the network nonsense, and none of it worked. What to try?
2008-04-29T06:43:00.000Z	ariqs		btw: for future reference to any devs out there, the partition manager is kinda annoying. It either makes you install it on whatever partition it chooses or you have to select all the details you don't know about yourself. there should be an in between one that does all the drive format stuff for you, but doesn't force you to use one partition

2008-05-11T10:49:00.000Z	ariqs	bazhang	I've had enough trying to figure out bugs with linux nonsense. It's a waste of a day. I'm all for giving up and trying a new prog at this point
2008-05-11T10:50:00.000Z	bazhang	ariqs	the most powerful are command line only you know
2008-05-11T10:51:00.000Z	ariqs	bazhang	if by most powerful you mean you have the most opotions because the process is broke into 10 steps, I'd argue that that sort of power is just waste of time ;P
