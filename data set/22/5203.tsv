2007-06-23T08:51:00.000Z	kravlin		hey. can installing grub on the partition stop windows from loading correctly? I'm working on creating a dual boot system and it gives me a disk error when it reboots in the install.
2007-06-23T08:51:00.000Z	ahorner	kravlin	FOR GODS SAKE DONT PUT GRUB ON WINDOWS INSTILLATIONS
2007-06-23T08:52:00.000Z	ahorner	kravlin	use vista boot manager
2007-06-23T08:52:00.000Z	ahorner		well
2007-06-23T08:52:00.000Z	ahorner		nvm
2007-06-23T08:52:00.000Z	ahorner		i dont know
2007-06-23T08:52:00.000Z	kravlin	ahorner	I used grub to boot into windows once already but that was on a different HD that was slow and useless. Oh and i'm working with xp instead of vista.
2007-06-23T08:52:00.000Z	ahorner		yea
2007-06-23T08:52:00.000Z	ahorner		umm use boot.ini
2007-06-23T08:54:00.000Z	kravlin	ahorner	Its not like windows is the main system i'm using. its mainly for gaming. Better way of asking my question. Grub points to the beginning of the disk that i'm currently using. Is there a way to make it only point to the MBR?
2007-06-23T08:55:00.000Z	ahorner	kravlin	it will only write to the mbr.. shouldnt be any problem. if u need to go back to legacy, download vista boot pro, it will reinstall the mbr without touching the rest of ur hd
2007-06-23T08:55:00.000Z	kravlin	ahorner	on top of that i don't think it would matter. I get it when trying to reboot into the second half of the windows install.
2007-06-23T08:56:00.000Z	ahorner	kravlin	i dont understand
2007-06-23T08:57:00.000Z	kravlin	ahorner	I get a disk error when i try to install windows XP. When it's installing it reboots into the graphical part of the install. At that point i get a disk error instead of going into the graphical install.
2007-06-23T08:58:00.000Z	kravlin	ahorner	i Installed windows on another hard drive that was noizy and old (over 8 years old IDE) I repartitioned this disk and i have ubuntu running in the first partion.
2007-06-23T08:58:00.000Z	kravlin	ahorner	I wanted to put windows in the third Physical Partition on this disk so i started the install process. I've done GRUB reinstalls about 4 times so its no big deal for me.
2007-06-23T08:59:00.000Z	kravlin	ahorner	but when it rebooted after copying the files without any config it gives me a disk error. When i reinstall grub Ubuntu works fine. Its driving me nuts because i don't want to reload Ubuntu.
2007-06-23T09:00:00.000Z	kravlin	ahorner	My last resort is wiping out the entire disk and going from scratch but it have to backup everything and i don't know a good app for doing so.
2007-06-23T09:01:00.000Z	kravlin	ahorner	I figure its a problem with the bootloader because for a while i had the bootloader point to the first partition and had grub installed there.
2007-06-23T09:01:00.000Z	kravlin	ahorner	any ideas?
2007-06-23T09:03:00.000Z	kravlin		mike3: Not to mention the tons of free software that's just as good as the expensive stuff out there.
2007-06-23T09:06:00.000Z	kravlin	ahorner	Any ideas????
