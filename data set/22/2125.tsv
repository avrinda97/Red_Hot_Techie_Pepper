2010-04-09T12:29:00.000Z	MailGon		okay i opened gparted
2010-04-09T12:29:00.000Z	MailGon		how do I remove my linux distribution?
2010-04-09T12:29:00.000Z	MailGon		theres 3 partitions:
2010-04-09T12:29:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	Is any of them 'ext4'?
2010-04-09T12:30:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	Format that :D And done.
2010-04-09T12:30:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	The ext4 one.... linux-swap... hm, you can remove that completely, as a matter of fact, since you will not need swap
2010-04-09T12:31:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	The swap space, kinda to work with RAM better
2010-04-09T12:31:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	Yes, obviously
2010-04-09T12:31:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	Your USB would be in vfat
2010-04-09T12:32:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	Delete both ext4 and linux-swap, expand your windows partition to all that space
2010-04-09T12:33:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	Huh. It's active?! Strange. Do "sudo swapoff -a" in terminal
2010-04-09T12:35:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	Yeah yeah, now expand your Windows partition
2010-04-09T12:35:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	Right click -> Resize/Move -> Set the space it uses to max
2010-04-09T12:35:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	Then right clicky it and choose unmount.
2010-04-09T12:36:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	"New"?!
2010-04-09T12:36:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	Uh. Do you already have Windows installed?
2010-04-09T12:37:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	Okay, then just do -> Device -> Create Partition Table -> Okay. Will be by far easier to just recreate it then jump around
2010-04-09T12:38:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	Well, 2 unallocated places is quite a weirdness. If we could merge them... But dunno how :P
2010-04-09T12:39:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	No, ext2 is a Linux filesystem :P You need NTFS
2010-04-09T12:39:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	Just make sure NTFS is selected as filesystem
2010-04-09T12:40:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	!?!?! o_O
2010-04-09T12:40:00.000Z	theadmin	MailGon	Obviously :P Partition table is the main thing on the disk :/
