2010-09-21T04:35:00.000Z	subspider		?
2010-09-21T04:35:00.000Z	Gnea	subspider	can you see anything on the screen?
2010-09-21T04:35:00.000Z	subspider	Gnea	yes
2010-09-21T04:36:00.000Z	Gnea	subspider	glad I could help :)
2010-09-21T04:37:00.000Z	subspider	Gnea	i mean i have restricted drivers installed but it's not working properly
2010-09-21T04:37:00.000Z	Gnea	subspider	which video card do you have?
2010-09-21T04:38:00.000Z	Gnea	subspider	can you paste the output of this command:  lspci | grep VGA
2010-09-21T04:40:00.000Z	Gnea	subspider	please run this command, then repeat that command: update-pciids
2010-09-21T04:42:00.000Z	Gnea	subspider	now do lspci again
2010-09-21T04:42:00.000Z	subspider	Gnea	VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Madison [Mobility Radeon HD 5000 Series]
2010-09-21T04:43:00.000Z	Gnea	subspider	what driver are you trying to use?
2010-09-21T04:45:00.000Z	Gnea	subspider	that could be a problem, as you'll only want to use the repository driver. having the ati website driver installed at the same time can mess things up.
2010-09-21T04:46:00.000Z	subspider	Gnea	but it was not working with both :(
2010-09-21T04:47:00.000Z	Gnea	subspider	that's the point.
2010-09-21T04:47:00.000Z	Gnea	subspider	you have to uninstall the one from the ati site and use only the one for it to try to work right
2010-09-21T04:47:00.000Z	subspider	Gnea	if i grab a window for one side to the other is too slow
2010-09-21T04:48:00.000Z	Gnea	subspider	find the script you used to install it with and type it with --help
2010-09-21T04:49:00.000Z	subspider	Gnea	ati-driver-installer-10-8-x86.x86_64.run
2010-09-21T04:49:00.000Z	Gnea	subspider	yeah, so ati-driver-installer-10-8-x86.x86_64.run --help
