2005-05-02T10:50:00.000Z	dequacker		I have a problem installing DVD::Rip (and the forums haven't been able to help me) :(

2005-05-02T10:51:00.000Z	Depht	dequacker	does it not just work?
2005-05-02T10:51:00.000Z	dequacker	Depht	exactly.
2005-05-02T10:51:00.000Z	dequacker		It can't install using apt-get, and I can't apt-get transcode either.
2005-05-02T10:52:00.000Z	dequacker		moritz, para que buscas ese canal?

2005-05-02T10:52:00.000Z	Depht	dequacker	when does it go wrong? it selects all the packages for me, but I don't fancy installing them all right now...
2005-05-02T10:53:00.000Z	dequacker		depht I have this same problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=17758
2005-05-02T10:54:00.000Z	dequacker		moritz ist deutscht? oy vey. Der Untergang ist gut.
2005-05-02T10:55:00.000Z	dequacker		Thanks, but I was just replying something to moritz. I speak fluent English. No need to recommend me to go here and there. :)
2005-05-02T10:57:00.000Z	dequacker		Hmm.
2005-05-02T10:57:00.000Z	dequacker		LOL. I don't think they'll like it if you try them out in here, moritz.
2005-05-02T10:58:00.000Z	dequacker		wtf. Now everyone is interested in learning foreign languages.
2005-05-02T10:58:00.000Z	dequacker	Depht	any insight on what the problem with DVD::Rip might be?
2005-05-02T10:59:00.000Z	Depht	dequacker	not really, I don't get any dependency messages at all
2005-05-02T10:59:00.000Z	dequacker	Depht	I do. I don't know what the problem is. I tried the solution one of these guys gave in the forum and it didn't help me.
