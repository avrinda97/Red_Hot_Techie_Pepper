2006-05-21T16:51:00.000Z	ahmad	soundray	: Where do i go to that program? Cuz i downloaded a theme for it
2006-05-21T16:52:00.000Z	soundray	ahmad	configure gnome/metacity themes through System-Preferences-Themes
2006-05-22T10:09:00.000Z	soundray	ahmad	Karim, please ask yourselves if you are still on topic
2006-05-22T12:18:00.000Z	soundray	ahmad	don't repeat please. Do not enter the 'Bash~$' part.
2006-05-22T12:18:00.000Z	ahmad	soundray	: Ok
2006-05-22T12:18:00.000Z	soundray	ahmad	and replace <username> and <ip> with an actual username and IP address.
2006-05-22T12:19:00.000Z	ahmad	soundray	: How i find out the user name of the other omputer, is it like the start up anme
2006-05-22T12:19:00.000Z	soundray	ahmad	for example, to log in on my router here, I would use 'ssh root@192.168.1.1'
2006-05-22T12:19:00.000Z	ahmad	soundray	But for a windows computer on my network, how would i find the user name
2006-05-22T12:20:00.000Z	soundray	ahmad	it's the login name you would use if you were at that computer's console
2006-05-22T12:20:00.000Z	soundray	ahmad	are you running sshd on the Windows machine?
2006-05-22T12:20:00.000Z	ahmad	soundray	: no
2006-05-22T12:20:00.000Z	soundray	ahmad	you would need that before it will work.
2006-05-22T12:21:00.000Z	ahmad	soundray	: oh man, lol. I wanted to try to shut the computer down and freak out my om
2006-05-22T12:22:00.000Z	soundray	ahmad	that would be a felony in this country (even if it's your mom's computer)
2006-05-22T12:31:00.000Z	soundray	ahmad	why don't you just ask your question? That has worked for you before, hasn't it?
