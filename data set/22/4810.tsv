2007-10-03T08:44:00.000Z	generalsnus		jeez, dont think i have the patience to wait 15 days for the 7.10 release.. is the beta stable enough for regular use atm? or is it full of bugs?
2007-10-03T08:44:00.000Z	Pici	generalsnus	Its buggy. I would wait if I was you.
2007-10-03T10:28:00.000Z	Pici	generalsnus	Not yet.
2007-10-18T22:00:00.000Z	Pici	generalsnus	xlibs-dev
2007-10-18T22:01:00.000Z	generalsnus	Pici	E: Package xlibs-dev has no installation candidate
2007-10-18T22:02:00.000Z	Pici	generalsnus	you need to enable the source repositories in system>administration>software sources first
2007-10-18T22:07:00.000Z	generalsnus	Pici	it wont enable ..ill either get a empty check box..or with a " - "
2007-10-18T22:07:00.000Z	Pici	generalsnus	was it dashed before, or empty?
2007-10-18T22:08:00.000Z	generalsnus	Pici	was just a " - "
2007-10-18T22:08:00.000Z	Pici	generalsnus	hold on, let me look
2007-10-18T22:09:00.000Z	generalsnus	Pici	i disabled the cd-rom tho
2007-10-18T22:09:00.000Z	Pici	generalsnus	close out of the tool and go back in then try again
2007-10-18T22:10:00.000Z	generalsnus	Pici	ok did that now.. after enabling it downloads package info.. but i hangs on dl 8 of 22
2007-10-18T22:11:00.000Z	Pici	generalsnus	I think its just slow, getting hammered.
2007-10-18T22:18:00.000Z	generalsnus	Pici	ive enabled everything now..but still: E: Package xlibs-dev has no installation candidate
2007-10-18T22:19:00.000Z	Pici	generalsnus	We're talking about gutsy, right?
2007-10-18T22:19:00.000Z	Pici	generalsnus	if so, give me a minute
2007-10-18T22:19:00.000Z	Pici	generalsnus	sorry, the package is xlibs-static-dev
2007-10-18T22:21:00.000Z	generalsnus	Pici	ok.. after this i still get some Make errors: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41092/
2007-10-18T22:22:00.000Z	Pici	generalsnus	If ./configure didnt complain about anything else, then I dont know. sorry.
2007-10-18T22:26:00.000Z	generalsnus	Pici	i redid all the steps after i downloaded all you said..and it installed without any problem  but when i do nvclock command.. i dont get any gui for it..
2007-10-18T22:26:00.000Z	Pici	generalsnus	Is there a gui? I'm not familiar with that tool
