2007-06-13T14:46:00.000Z	nanotaboada	AdvoWork	try chown user:user files
2007-06-13T14:47:00.000Z	nanotaboada	AdvoWork	whatever you need to change the ownership
2007-06-13T14:48:00.000Z	AdvoWork	nanotaboada	dont get what you mean sorry :/
2007-06-13T14:49:00.000Z	nanotaboada	AdvoWork	no problem, are you trying to manage some files? i've read your tread in the middle maybe i'm wrong
2007-06-13T14:50:00.000Z	AdvoWork	nanotaboada	basically im using vsftp ive setup a user who can now connect to the server etc, but they cant make folders, or cant copy files across
2007-06-13T14:50:00.000Z	nanotaboada	AdvoWork	you should edit .bashrc
2007-06-13T14:51:00.000Z	nanotaboada	AdvoWork	export $HOME=/home/ftp
2007-06-13T14:52:00.000Z	AdvoWork	nanotaboada	to do that, wont it do it for all users, what if i only want the user testuser to change HOME dir
2007-06-13T14:53:00.000Z	nanotaboada	AdvoWork	i'm not getting you, i think it'd apply for that session
2007-06-13T14:54:00.000Z	AdvoWork	nanotaboada	basically i need to set the user "testuser"'s home dir to home/ftp so when they connect to the ftp site, theyre directed to there(there real home dir)
2007-06-13T14:55:00.000Z	nanotaboada	AdvoWork	mmm i think it'd probably better either managing that permissions from apache access lists or, including those users in the ftp group
2007-06-13T14:56:00.000Z	nanotaboada	AdvoWork	what do you mean by "ftp site"?
2007-06-13T14:57:00.000Z	AdvoWork	nanotaboada	well ftp site - ftp server
2007-06-13T15:10:00.000Z	nanotaboada	AdvoWork	to test ssh?
2007-06-13T15:11:00.000Z	nanotaboada	AdvoWork	you'd simply do ssh ipaddress -l user
2007-06-13T15:11:00.000Z	AdvoWork	nanotaboada	well he said when logged in via ssh? but im not doing it that way. all im doing is connecting with a ftp client from another machine on the same network to the ftp server, or am i getting confused what he means?
2007-06-13T15:12:00.000Z	nanotaboada	AdvoWork	yes perhaps you're mixing, why not just using ssh?
2007-06-13T15:12:00.000Z	nanotaboada	AdvoWork	i mean why ftp? are those windows clients?
2007-06-13T15:14:00.000Z	AdvoWork	nanotaboada	any reason why?
2007-06-13T15:14:00.000Z	nanotaboada	AdvoWork	yes, many, it stands for secure shell, so it's either secure, and you use the same commands as in your local shell
2007-06-13T15:15:00.000Z	nanotaboada	AdvoWork	no but you don't ssh to a webserver, you ssh to a shell
