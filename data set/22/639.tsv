2011-09-23T00:38:00.000Z	Omni_Lynk		Anyone know a good program that can setup an ISO to a USB Thumb/Pen Drive? Every version i've found so far wants me to go w/ a CD instead of the Thumbdrive i have.
2011-09-23T00:38:00.000Z	KM0201	Omni_Lynk	for windows?
2011-09-23T00:38:00.000Z	Omni_Lynk	KM0201	For VMware
2011-09-23T00:38:00.000Z	KM0201		have no idea about vmware
2011-09-23T00:39:00.000Z	Omni_Lynk	KM0201	I have the ISO, just need a program that will burn it to my Thumbdrive.
2011-09-23T00:39:00.000Z	KM0201	Omni_Lynk	why do you need a usb (or CD for that mater) for vmware.. just boot directly from the ISO.
2011-09-23T00:40:00.000Z	Omni_Lynk	KM0201	how do you boot directly from the ISO?
2011-09-23T00:41:00.000Z	KM0201	Omni_Lynk	it's an option under the settings.
2011-09-23T00:41:00.000Z	KM0201		i know its there, but i don't use vmware so not 100% sure
2011-09-23T00:41:00.000Z	KM0201		but its there.
2011-09-23T00:41:00.000Z	Omni_Lynk	KM0201	i have not installed it yet. it is going on a clean hard drive..
2011-09-23T00:41:00.000Z	KM0201	Omni_Lynk	i thought you said you were using vmware
2011-09-23T00:42:00.000Z	Omni_Lynk	KM0201	i will be, i've downloaded the ISO, but cannot get it to start up on my thumb drive.
2011-09-23T00:42:00.000Z	KM0201	Omni_Lynk	why are you tryig to start it on a USB< if you want to install it in vmware?.. all you have to do is boot the ISO in vmware.. thats my point.
2011-09-23T00:43:00.000Z	Omni_Lynk	KM0201	 So i should just run the ISO in Ubuntu and install it into the clean Hard drive?
2011-09-23T00:43:00.000Z	KM0201	Omni_Lynk	you're making no sense... i can't make heads or tails of what you're wanting to do.
2011-09-23T00:44:00.000Z	KM0201	Omni_Lynk	vmware, installs to a virtual drive, not a hard drive.
2011-09-23T00:45:00.000Z	Omni_Lynk	KM0201	So VMware does not run first, you boot from the OS, then into VMWare?
2011-09-23T00:46:00.000Z	KM0201	Omni_Lynk	sorry.... i have no idea what you're asking, you're gonna have to ask questions that make sense, in order to get help
2011-09-23T00:46:00.000Z	Omni_Lynk	KM0201	k then..
2011-09-23T00:47:00.000Z	Omni_Lynk		Anyone know of a program that will burn an ISO to a Thumbdrive instead of a CD/DVD
2011-09-23T00:47:00.000Z	KM0201	Omni_Lynk	unetbootin
