2010-03-05T17:31:00.000Z	nhak		what is the programm of Alt-F2 ?
2010-03-05T17:33:00.000Z	nhak		i know the use of alt-f2, just want to know how it works
2010-03-05T17:33:00.000Z	nhak		just a small application using bash right ?
2010-03-05T17:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nhak	 its a gnome command/app i imagine. not a 'bash' script
2010-03-05T17:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nhak	 very little differances
2010-03-05T17:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nhak	 icon launches whatever its set to launch.. should be the same if they run the same command
2010-03-05T17:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nhak	depends on the variables. :)
2010-03-05T17:39:00.000Z	nhak	Dr_Willis	so the program started by launching the icon can not surely see the variables ?
2010-03-05T17:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nhak	 depends on how/what is being launched.. you launch a terminal with icons.. it runs specific scripts.. if a launcher wanted to it can also spawn a bash shell and see whatever variables.. it should also see any allready exported variables.
2010-03-06T14:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nhak	 for a terminal i like to use 'terminator' more and more. Its a gnome-terminal on steroids. :)
2010-03-06T14:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nhak	 terminator works easier for me then lots of tabs in a gnome-terminal
2010-03-06T14:13:00.000Z	nhak	Dr_Willis	hmm with terminator you have several gnome-terminals in a window ?
2010-03-06T14:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nhak	 exactly - side by side, vertical, horiz. or have tabs...
2010-03-06T14:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nhak	 its some sort of fancy wrapper around gnome-terminal
2010-03-06T14:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nhak	 all of them have copy/paste...  theres different ones that do tabs.. personally i find tabs awkward
2010-03-06T14:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nhak	 thers proberly a dozen terminal emulators out there you can try.. and a dozen more that are just simple variants of the other 12
2010-03-06T14:22:00.000Z	nhak	Dr_Willis	ok thanks i will try it
2010-03-08T17:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nhak	 you can mount iso files  allready.. no need for that deamontools stuff
2010-03-08T17:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nhak	 linux has had that feature for YEARS  befor deamontools was even out. :)
2010-03-08T17:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nhak	 dont expect it to get around Copy protection of game disks however
2010-03-08T17:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nhak	 GO read teh vbox docs.. virtualbox allready HAS that feature built in. it can access iso files as if they were cd's
2010-03-08T17:56:00.000Z	nhak	Dr_Willis	thanks
