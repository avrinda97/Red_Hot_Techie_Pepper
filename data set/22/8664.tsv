2005-07-02T16:58:00.000Z	bigfoot1		can someone help me with visualboyadvance?
2005-07-02T16:58:00.000Z	bigfoot1		I'd like to run it in GUI.
2005-07-02T16:58:00.000Z	ronybeck	bigfoot1	what is the problem?
2005-07-02T16:59:00.000Z	bigfoot1	ronybeck	hello. Thank you for your response. Are you familiar with VBA? Do you use it?
2005-07-02T16:59:00.000Z	ronybeck	bigfoot1	Does visualboyadvanced not come with a GUI?
2005-07-02T16:59:00.000Z	ronybeck	bigfoot1	unfortunatly not :-)
2005-07-02T05:00:00.000Z	ronybeck	bigfoot1	so we need to find a front end for it.  Have you tried looking at www.freshmeat.net?
2005-07-02T05:01:00.000Z	bigfoot1	ronybeck	i'll look at freshmeat.net now. Is GnomeBoyadvance the best for ubuntu users?
2005-07-02T05:03:00.000Z	ronybeck	bigfoot1	it is in synaptic ;)
2005-07-02T05:03:00.000Z	bigfoot1	ronybeck	GnomeBoyAdvance is in synaptic? Great. Let me get it then. Do i still need to keep VisualBoyADvance?
2005-07-02T05:04:00.000Z	ronybeck	bigfoot1	I just installed it just now.  All I need now is some ROM's ;)
2005-07-02T05:04:00.000Z	bigfoot1	ronybeck	GnomeBoyadvance is in synaptic? what's the search term i should use?
2005-07-02T05:05:00.000Z	bigfoot1	ronybeck	i can't find GnomeBoyAdvance is synaptic. I could only find VisualBoyAdvance.
2005-07-02T05:05:00.000Z	bigfoot1	ronybeck	correction: ... _in_ synaptic....
2005-07-02T05:06:00.000Z	ronybeck	bigfoot1	ok,  are you searching on description and name
2005-07-02T05:06:00.000Z	bigfoot1	ronybeck	you found gnomeboyadvance in synaptic?
2005-07-02T05:06:00.000Z	ronybeck	bigfoot1	I searched for "visualboy"
2005-07-02T05:06:00.000Z	bigfoot1	ronybeck	i already have visualboy. i want a front-end for it.
2005-07-02T05:07:00.000Z	ronybeck	bigfoot1	yeah but one of the matches I get when searching for visualboy is gnomeboyadvanced
2005-07-02T05:07:00.000Z	ronybeck	bigfoot1	 /etc/apt/sources.list from memory.  You need to uncomment some of the lines to enable some disabled repositories'
2005-07-02T05:09:00.000Z	ronybeck	bigfoot1	open up the sources.list in vi or something and uncomment the repositories
2005-07-02T05:09:00.000Z	bigfoot1	ronybeck	 i don't think i even have them in my sources list.
