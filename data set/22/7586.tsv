2006-02-26T14:20:00.000Z	NickGarvey		yeah, but dhcp gives it the same ip everytime anyway
2006-02-26T14:20:00.000Z	NickGarvey		alright

2006-02-26T14:22:00.000Z	NickGarvey		I'm a 15 year old messing around, not a big problem for me
2006-02-26T14:22:00.000Z	NickGarvey		even if I was cracked not like I keep anything important on there
2006-02-26T14:23:00.000Z	soundray	NickGarvey	ever heard about zombie networks? You don't want to be part of one, even if you're just messing about.
2006-02-26T14:24:00.000Z	soundray	NickGarvey	add the netmask and gateway lines from nm's repost on pastebin.
2006-02-26T14:25:00.000Z	NickGarvey	soundray	where is his repost?
2006-02-26T14:25:00.000Z	soundray	NickGarvey	9062
2006-02-26T14:26:00.000Z	soundray	NickGarvey	not for the gateway, unless your server is also the gateway.
2006-04-02T15:56:00.000Z	soundray	NickGarvey	http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/ any better?
2006-04-30T14:17:00.000Z	soundray	NickGarvey	is there another way? (just kidding)
2006-08-17T12:04:00.000Z	NickGarvey	soundray	use a boot cd and chmod -x that script
2006-08-17T12:04:00.000Z	soundray	NickGarvey	which script?
2006-08-17T12:05:00.000Z	NickGarvey	soundray	in /etc/rc.?/networking
2006-08-17T12:05:00.000Z	soundray	NickGarvey	thanks, found an old breezy live CD
2006-08-17T12:20:00.000Z	soundray	NickGarvey	jrib: now that I've disable networking, it hangs after "Checking all filesystems". Any idea what might be going on?
