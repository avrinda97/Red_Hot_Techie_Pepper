2008-02-21T09:26:00.000Z	EADG	ubu2	Wasn't following the convo, what do you want to do?
2008-02-21T09:26:00.000Z	ubu2	EADG	I want my console to be 1024x768, the resolution of my LCD monitor
2008-02-21T09:26:00.000Z	EADG	ubu2	Running Gutsy?
2008-02-21T09:28:00.000Z	EADG	ubu2	K, Gutsy did some things ab it diffrent than previous releases in that the framebuffer is disabled by default. So what ya need to do is re-enable it. Pretty easy, but you need to edit 3 files.
2008-02-21T09:29:00.000Z	EADG	ubu2	gimme a couple minutes to track down a url for you.

2008-02-21T09:45:00.000Z	EADG	ubu2	hehe, don't give up. It's possible. It's one of the first things I did when I installed Gutsy.
2008-02-21T09:47:00.000Z	EADG	ubu2	I spend most me time in CLI with Screen... couldn't live there if I couldn't have better res, and a better looking font.
