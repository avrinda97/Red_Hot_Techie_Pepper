2010-06-03T11:08:00.000Z	soreau	hiexpo	That wiki page is horrible mistuned
2010-06-03T11:09:00.000Z	soreau	hiexpo	It is telling to install the fglrx driver but it doesnt support his card
2010-06-03T11:09:00.000Z	soreau	hiexpo	He doesnt need to install fglrx
2010-06-03T11:09:00.000Z	soreau	hiexpo	In fact if he installs fglrx he might not have X anymore
2010-06-03T11:10:00.000Z	soreau	hiexpo	They wont update the ati factoid and Im not updating their wiki page so ati users will remain confused
2010-08-09T05:57:00.000Z	soreau	hiexpo	Not if they are user commands
2010-08-09T05:57:00.000Z	hiexpo	soreau	 i was just gonna comment that
2010-08-09T05:57:00.000Z	soreau	hiexpo	Not a good idea to tell new people to run things with sudo, blindly
2011-03-06T12:00:00.000Z	hiexpo	soreau	i have seen that problem before also so i use cp  command
2011-03-06T12:02:00.000Z	soreau	hiexpo	To do what?
2011-03-06T12:03:00.000Z	hiexpo	soreau	to copy the iso to the usb
2011-03-06T12:35:00.000Z	soreau	hiexpo	FWIW, I fixed it by using umount from the CLI, then the node didn't disappear and ran mkfs.vfat then pluggen it back in, looked like brand new
