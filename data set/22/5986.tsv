2007-01-25T17:41:00.000Z	jrib	OrangeOrange	gconf-editor is what you are looking for
2007-01-25T17:42:00.000Z	OrangeOrange	jrib	thanks.. was confused
2007-01-25T17:42:00.000Z	OrangeOrange		i want to copy a file over a folder.. however i dont have perimisssion.. wat to do under GUI..
2007-01-25T17:43:00.000Z	jrib	OrangeOrange	what are you trying to delete?
2007-01-25T17:43:00.000Z	OrangeOrange		nothing just adding a splash.png
2007-01-25T17:43:00.000Z	jrib	OrangeOrange	why would that require copying a file over a folder?
2007-01-25T17:43:00.000Z	OrangeOrange	jrib	i think its locked under a directory.....
2007-01-25T17:44:00.000Z	jrib		!splash | OrangeOrange
2007-01-25T17:45:00.000Z	OrangeOrange	jrib	yea i know... but i think its locked under this directory (keyname) "apps/gnome-session/options/splash_image"
2007-01-25T17:45:00.000Z	jrib	OrangeOrange	what do you mean "locked"?
2007-01-25T17:45:00.000Z	OrangeOrange	jrib	or i type my dir wrong?
2007-01-25T17:45:00.000Z	OrangeOrange	jrib	if i edit my splash key
2007-01-25T17:46:00.000Z	OrangeOrange	jrib	"name" is grey uneditable only value is editable i put in /home/jason/splash.png... doesnt work.. used the other splashes
2007-01-25T17:46:00.000Z	OrangeOrange	jrib	other default splash
2007-01-25T17:47:00.000Z	jrib	OrangeOrange	does the key value now say /home/jason/slash.png?
2007-01-25T17:47:00.000Z	OrangeOrange		yes
2007-01-25T17:47:00.000Z	OrangeOrange	jrib	so..
2007-01-25T17:49:00.000Z	jrib	OrangeOrange	ok, so name your splash.png to jason.png and copy it to /usr/share/pixmaps/splash/  then cahnge the key value to splash/jason.png
2007-01-25T17:50:00.000Z	OrangeOrange	jrib	so im correct :> its locked
2007-01-25T17:50:00.000Z	jrib	OrangeOrange	I don't know what you mean by "locked".  But the key's description explains the path is a relative one
