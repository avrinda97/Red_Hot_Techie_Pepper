2011-02-06T20:50:00.000Z	th_		hello. im making a bash script to start things. what is the correct line to start command line programs so it starts a gnome-terminal
2011-02-06T20:50:00.000Z	th_		*runs them in gnome-terminal
2011-02-06T20:51:00.000Z	mkanyicy	th_	you are not clear
2011-02-06T20:52:00.000Z	th_	mkanyicy	somebody got me :P
2011-02-06T20:52:00.000Z	mkanyicy	th_	good luck
2011-02-06T20:56:00.000Z	mkanyicy	th_	you cant scp to your local machine if ssh server is not running
2011-02-06T20:57:00.000Z	th_	mkanyicy	yes that is why i start it when needed
2011-02-06T20:57:00.000Z	mkanyicy	th_	ok
2011-02-06T20:58:00.000Z	mkanyicy	th_	but you can't enable ssh server on  that machine while you are on another machine wanting to 'push' files into it by scp
2011-02-06T20:59:00.000Z	th_	mkanyicy	true. but my needs are very limited. i mostly download stuff from the schools network
2011-02-06T21:00:00.000Z	mkanyicy	th_	I think scp doesnt need an ssh server in that mode, when you run it from your own machine to pull/download files from remote machines
2011-02-06T21:01:00.000Z	th_	mkanyicy	but for sending?
2011-02-06T21:01:00.000Z	mkanyicy	th_	yes for sending it is needed
