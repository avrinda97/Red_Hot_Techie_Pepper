2008-02-09T04:22:00.000Z	kockas		package wine is not available,but is referred to by another package.This may mean that the package is missing,has been obsoleted or is only available from another source
2008-02-09T04:22:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	system->admin->software sources , enable the first 4 and disable the cdrom
2008-02-09T04:27:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	  go to system->admin software sources , enable the first four items , disable the cdrom
2008-02-09T04:27:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	then try installing wine again
2008-02-09T04:30:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	system , then press admin, then press software sources. You will see some items with checkboxes. Check the first four, then uncheck the cdrom
2008-02-09T04:31:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	do you see system on the same bar as applications?
2008-02-09T04:31:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	are you running ubuntu or kubuntu?
2008-02-09T04:33:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	http://www.monkeez.org/linux/ubuntu/screenshot2.png , top bar, left, it has applications places system
2008-02-09T04:33:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	did you see my last to you? I showed you a screenshot of what you are looking for
2008-02-09T04:35:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	then you have something very odd, how about a screenshot?
2008-02-09T04:37:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	press print screen key
2008-02-09T04:39:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	put it on http://photobucket.com/register.php?action=unpw  (and use my nick in your replies, it's red her and I won't miss it )
2008-02-09T04:39:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	brb in 5
2008-02-09T04:45:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	yes
2008-02-09T04:48:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	lol, this is frustrating.  try typing   lsb_release in a terminal, tell me what the codename is
2008-02-09T04:48:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	lsb_release -a that is
2008-02-09T04:50:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	don't see it.   try this in a terminal:   lsb_release -a  , and tell me what the codename is
2008-02-09T04:52:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	then find something that says about ubuntu. I think you have a very old version
2008-02-09T04:54:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	ah, that seems to be hoary even. You need to download a recent version, that one doesn't get support anymore.   http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.10
2008-02-09T04:55:00.000Z	nickrud	kockas	I just did :)
