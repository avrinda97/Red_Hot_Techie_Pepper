2006-04-28T13:12:00.000Z	blackeyes		anyone know how to boot into safe/rescue/sincle user mode in dapper PPC? shouldn't it be really easy?
2006-04-28T13:12:00.000Z	blackeyes		something is wrong with my xorg and i need to edit it
2006-04-28T13:12:00.000Z	blackeyes		I just want to boot to a terminal prompt
2006-04-28T13:13:00.000Z	blackeyes		doing it in OS X you just hit command-S at startup
2006-04-28T13:13:00.000Z	blackeyes		there has to be a similar shortcut for ubuntu
2006-04-28T13:13:00.000Z	blackeyes		can anyone tell me how?
2006-04-28T13:15:00.000Z	blackeyes		am I doing something wrong, resulting in me being ignored?
2006-04-28T13:15:00.000Z	blackeyes		i figured this would be an easy thing to do -- boot into single user/rescue mode on dapper PPC
2006-04-28T13:16:00.000Z	blackeyes		i don't have grub though, it's yaboot
2006-04-28T13:16:00.000Z	blackeyes		it seems very weird to me that I can't easily find how to do this in any documentation easily
2006-04-28T13:16:00.000Z	alfabet	blackeyes	then you are running ppc
2006-04-28T13:17:00.000Z	blackeyes	alfabet	i know i'm running PPC
2006-04-28T13:19:00.000Z	alfabet	blackeyes	ok...then
2006-04-28T13:19:00.000Z	alfabet	blackeyes	what is your issue
2006-04-28T13:19:00.000Z	blackeyes	alfabet	i just want to boot into safe/single user mode
2006-04-28T13:19:00.000Z	alfabet	blackeyes	it should show you parameters
2006-04-28T13:19:00.000Z	alfabet	blackeyes	hold s
2006-04-28T13:19:00.000Z	alfabet	blackeyes	recardles you are looking for an s
2006-04-28T13:20:00.000Z	blackeyes	alfabet	hold s after rebooting?
2006-04-28T13:21:00.000Z	alfabet	blackeyes	you can try that
2006-04-28T13:21:00.000Z	alfabet	blackeyes	so then cut that and add -s
2006-04-28T13:22:00.000Z	blackeyes	alfabet	I don't see any of that, yaboot doesn't seem to have very many options
