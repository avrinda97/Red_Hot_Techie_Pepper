2006-08-25T14:01:00.000Z	Centaur5		What would make Dapper not mount flash drives automatically and how can it be fixed?
2006-08-25T14:01:00.000Z	door	Centaur5	 is your flash drive a USB drive?
2006-08-25T14:01:00.000Z	Centaur5	door	yes
2006-08-25T14:02:00.000Z	door	Centaur5	 do you have a line for it in your /etc/fstab file?
2006-08-25T14:02:00.000Z	door	Centaur5	 if so, what is it?
2006-08-25T14:02:00.000Z	Centaur5	door	I've never added anything, it used to mount them automatically.
2006-08-25T14:03:00.000Z	door	Centaur5	 in dapper?
2006-08-25T14:03:00.000Z	Centaur5		yes
2006-08-25T14:03:00.000Z	Centaur5		It mounts automatically in my other machine and also off the live cd if I boot from that.
2006-08-25T14:04:00.000Z	door	Centaur5	 try the command gnome-volume-manager
2006-08-25T14:05:00.000Z	Centaur5	door	That didn't bring anything up.
2006-08-25T14:05:00.000Z	door	Centaur5	 now try unplugging and then plugging back in your device
2006-08-25T14:06:00.000Z	door	Centaur5	the program is a daemon, so it runs in the background
2006-08-25T14:06:00.000Z	Centaur5	door	still nothing
2006-08-25T14:07:00.000Z	Centaur5	door	Okay, it just worked in my 3rd usb port.
2006-08-25T14:07:00.000Z	door		aha
2006-08-25T14:07:00.000Z	door	Centaur5	aha
2006-08-25T14:07:00.000Z	Centaur5		Thanks door, that's a really useful thing to know if I have that problem in the future.
2006-08-25T14:08:00.000Z	door	Centaur5	 no problem. Maybe add it to a startup thing for GNOME? It's supposed to start automatically
2006-08-25T14:08:00.000Z	Centaur5	door	Oh, would that be under services or should I just add that to startup programs?
2006-08-25T14:09:00.000Z	door	Centaur5	 I'm really sorry...I don't know--I haven't used GNOME in months. I *think* you can add it in sessions
2006-08-25T14:09:00.000Z	Centaur5	door	okay, well thanks again.
