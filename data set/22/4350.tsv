2009-03-04T13:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zta	it doesnt force them to upgrade at all, you can run fluxbuntu or xubuntuon some very old hardware
2009-03-04T13:05:00.000Z	Zta	ActionParsnip	I'm running a server.
2009-03-04T13:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zta	even better, no x server
2009-03-04T13:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zta	its fOSS which has zero warranty and zero SLA, they could turn off all the repos and theres nothing youo can do
2009-03-04T13:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zta	they choose to stop supporting the old versions as if it runs say 50 years then there will be aboout 100 old versions of ubuntu to make packages for the first couple incase some guy is still running it
2009-03-04T13:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zta	you can freely compile stuff
2009-03-04T13:09:00.000Z	Zta	ActionParsnip	oh please, don't sabotage the discussion with this crap.
2009-03-04T13:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zta	why, its a fact
2009-04-07T01:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zta	if the reader is attatched to the usb bus its as good as a usb stick
2009-04-07T01:27:00.000Z	Zta	ActionParsnip	It's actually attached to the PCMCIA..
2009-04-07T01:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zta	if the device shows up in lsusb, the pcmci is attatched to teh usb bus
2009-04-07T01:28:00.000Z	Zta	ActionParsnip	I think the PCMCIA bus is on PCI.
2009-04-07T01:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zta	then lspci will show it up
2009-04-07T01:28:00.000Z	Zta	ActionParsnip	it does.
2009-04-07T01:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zta	ok then its a pci device :)
2009-04-07T01:30:00.000Z	Zta	ActionParsnip	jupp
2009-04-07T01:46:00.000Z	Zta	ActionParsnip	Ah... I've been looking at the source to see what qualifies a device as becoming a potential target, and it seems my CF card doesn't have the HAL property volume.is_disc = "True".  It's false.
2011-10-24T21:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zta	use a different DE, or a different shell. You don't even have to use gnome.
2011-10-24T21:22:00.000Z	Zta	ActionParsnip	I liked the DE Prior to Unity.  Can I have that?  I only see Unity2D and Unity as options.
2011-10-24T21:25:00.000Z	Zta	ActionParsnip	I've heard the word GnomeShell, but I'm not sure what it covers.
2011-10-24T21:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zta	there are guides around but the ubottu factoid is all I can advise
2011-10-24T21:28:00.000Z	Zta	ActionParsnip	thanks
