2009-03-02T00:49:00.000Z	pronoy		hello no sound here guys
2009-03-02T00:50:00.000Z	pronoy		checked pulseaudio...all issues solved using the guide

2009-03-02T00:51:00.000Z	pronoy		audio issue please !!
2009-03-02T00:51:00.000Z	Codd	pronoy	I have the same problem with Jaunty alpha 5, apparently there is a bug in pulseaudio where a tight loop causes it to sit on the cpu and not let anyone else in.  They will be putting out the fix in the next push
2009-03-02T00:52:00.000Z	pronoy	Codd	solved in intrepid
2009-03-02T00:52:00.000Z	pronoy	Codd	funny eh >
2009-03-02T00:54:00.000Z	Codd	pronoy	 mleger; do either of you happen to have an atheros wifi adapter?  I was looking around for a fix and found that most actually have issues with the new ath5k driver
2009-03-02T00:57:00.000Z	Codd	pronoy	how about you?  are u using wifi too?
2009-03-02T00:57:00.000Z	pronoy	Codd	was using it...went back to good ol Rj45
2009-03-02T00:58:00.000Z	Codd	pronoy	did you have an atheros card in your system at all?
2009-03-02T00:58:00.000Z	pronoy	Codd	hey can you assist with this sound issue...we can't get sound even at boot time
2009-03-02T00:58:00.000Z	pronoy	Codd	i die
2009-03-02T00:58:00.000Z	pronoy	Codd	* i did
2009-03-02T00:59:00.000Z	Codd	pronoy	im not sure trading your problems for mine will make your day any better, I can't get more then 60 seconds of sound with out a nasty studder
2009-03-02T01:02:00.000Z	Codd	pronoy	unfortunately I didn't really do any magic to get it where I am now, it basically installed like this, I tried making myself a member of the pulse* groups but there hasn't been any notable improvements
2009-03-02T01:07:00.000Z	Codd	pronoy	I don't think this issue really provides any errors, I've tried running rythembox / amarok from the cli to see if anything gets printed and havent seen anything in /var/log/messages or dmesg
2009-03-02T01:08:00.000Z	pronoy	Codd	then how to detect what's the problem ?
2009-03-02T01:09:00.000Z	Codd	pronoy	apparently the devs know the issue, I guess enough people have complained or it is easy to reproduce
