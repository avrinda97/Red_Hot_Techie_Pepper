2004-11-03T08:01:00.000Z	ogra_	Se7h	what's the advantage over 1.0.0.1 ?
2004-11-03T08:03:00.000Z	ogra_	Se7h	dunno, the package name says 1.0.0 no minor number
2004-11-03T08:08:00.000Z	ogra_	Se7h	did you migrate your config from an older version ? my gaim works fine since weeks
2004-11-03T08:08:00.000Z	ogra_	Se7h	which cd ?
2004-11-03T08:10:00.000Z	ogra_	Se7h	i meant  preview or final
2004-11-03T08:11:00.000Z	ogra_	Se7h	final came out on 20th
2004-11-03T08:11:00.000Z	ogra_	Se7h	see the topic 
2004-11-03T08:11:00.000Z	ogra_	Se7h	ubuntu
2004-11-03T08:12:00.000Z	ogra_	Se7h	so you were supposed to do a dist upgrade to get your system to the final version
2004-11-03T08:13:00.000Z	ogra_	Se7h	see: http://wiki.ubuntulinux.org/WartyWarthog/UpgradeNotes
2004-11-03T08:15:00.000Z	ogra_	Se7h	probably a lib is not up to date which causes gaim to break....else i'd suspect your config, so move it to a backup and try starting gaim
2004-11-03T08:18:00.000Z	Se7h	ogra_	one more thing
