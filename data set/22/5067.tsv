2007-08-06T15:16:00.000Z	thx1137		Anyone know of a good screen video capture app?
2007-08-06T15:17:00.000Z	thx1137		pretty easy to use?
2007-08-06T15:19:00.000Z	thx1137		Oh yea, totem, that reminds me, anyone know how to open two or more videos through totem at once?
2007-08-06T15:20:00.000Z	thx1137		like, to open another video in a "new window"?
2007-08-06T07:48:00.000Z	thx1137		is there any sort of ...dare i say.. "safe boot" for ubuntu?
2007-08-06T07:48:00.000Z	soundray	thx1137	recovery mode, from the grub menu
2007-08-06T07:51:00.000Z	soundray	thx1137	what's the problem that you need safe mode for?
2007-08-06T07:52:00.000Z	soundray	thx1137	the Safe mode option from the Sessions tab at the login screen may come in handy.
2007-08-06T07:53:00.000Z	thx1137	soundray	well, my computer froze,had gotten compiz to work fine, and was trying to make a video.  It froze and now I can't get back in, looks like sometihng's going on with my home folder
2007-08-06T07:53:00.000Z	soundray	thx1137	can you log in on the text console? Ctrl-Alt-F1
2007-08-06T07:55:00.000Z	thx1137	soundray	says: "ALERT! does not exist. Dropping to a shell!  and then it's just a blinking cursor
2007-08-06T07:55:00.000Z	soundray	thx1137	oops, there's something wrong beyond your home directory then
2007-08-06T07:55:00.000Z	soundray	thx1137	have you got backups?
2007-08-06T07:59:00.000Z	thx1137	soundray	sort of, I'm using a virtual disk, and have a smaller home.virtual.disk that I was using before I enlarged it.
2007-08-06T08:00:00.000Z	soundray	thx1137	when something gets messed up like that, I tend to do a reinstall, rather than wasting the same amount of time (or more) on diagnostics.
2007-08-06T08:00:00.000Z	soundray	thx1137	although it can be more satisfying to actually work out what's wrong...
2007-08-06T08:01:00.000Z	soundray	thx1137	was there anything else in or before that error message you posted?
2007-08-06T08:02:00.000Z	thx1137	soundray	understandable, since I'm pretty new, I'm gradually learning.  I used Wubi to install ubuntu, and when I booted back into windows, it did a chkdsk and deleted my home.virtual.disk... lol
2007-08-06T08:03:00.000Z	soundray	thx1137	you can probably still do a backup of your ubuntu from Windows (using ext2fsd) or the live CD.
2007-08-06T08:04:00.000Z	thx1137	soundray	yeup, that's what I was going to do, until friggin' windows deleted the home file when it was doing a startup chkdsk  =/  oh well, I'll make another one and do it again, good practice anyway
2007-08-06T08:06:00.000Z	thx1137	soundray	thanks for tryin' to help me out, I'll have to check out that safe boot in the future
2007-08-06T08:06:00.000Z	soundray	thx1137	no problem
