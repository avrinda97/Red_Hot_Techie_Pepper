2006-12-15T16:58:00.000Z	Arwen	cmweb	ln -s
2006-12-15T17:00:00.000Z	cmweb	Arwen	whats wrong with this ln -s /home/owner/Desktop/WWW /var/www
2006-12-15T17:01:00.000Z	Arwen	cmweb	nothing
2006-12-16T17:01:00.000Z	cmweb	Arwen	nothing happened
2006-12-16T17:01:00.000Z	Arwen	cmweb	you might not be able to do that because only root can create links in /var
2006-12-16T17:01:00.000Z	Arwen	cmweb	it's ln -s <target> <location for symlink>
