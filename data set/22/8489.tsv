2005-10-27T11:42:00.000Z	nicoal		how would I set the ttl with iptables? is there a module that should be loaded aside from iptable_mangle? I try  iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -o eth1 -j TTL --ttl-set 128, but it gives me "iptables: No chain/target/match by that name"
2005-10-27T11:43:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	You are wanting to change the outgoign packet TTL?
2005-10-27T11:43:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	Why?
2005-10-27T11:43:00.000Z	nicoal	Lathiat	yes... I don't want my ISP finding out I have 2 computers using the same connection
2005-10-27T11:43:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	hrm, ooc how does that help that?
2005-10-27T11:44:00.000Z	nicoal	Lathiat	they seem to think that 2 computers should mean 2 payments... hehe
2005-10-27T11:44:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	let me see if i can find out how for you
2005-10-27T11:44:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	haha
2005-10-27T11:44:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	have you considered using NAT ?
2005-10-27T11:44:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	if you do that, they shouldnt be able to tell
2005-10-27T11:45:00.000Z	nicoal	Lathiat	I think I do use nat... that's what `iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE` part, doesn't it?
2005-10-27T11:46:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	yes
2005-10-27T11:46:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	if doing that, in theory, they shouldnt be able to tell
2005-10-27T11:46:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	ooc, where did you get the TTL idea from?
2005-10-27T11:47:00.000Z	nicoal	Lathiat	I was looking on this site http://easyfwgen.morizot.net/gen/ trying to get a basis of where to start writing iptables stuff, and I saw the mangle business, and I thought it looked/sounded cool ;)
2005-10-27T11:48:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	haha
2005-10-27T11:48:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	ok
2005-10-27T11:48:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	yeh NATting mkaes all connections appear to be from the same computer
2005-10-27T11:48:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	so you should be fine
2005-10-27T11:49:00.000Z	nicoal	Lathiat	sweet, thanks for your help :)
2005-10-27T11:49:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	nps
2005-10-27T12:00:00.000Z	Lathiat	nicoal	wine can emulate later versions sish
