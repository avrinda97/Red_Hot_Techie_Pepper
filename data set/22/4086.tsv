2008-03-22T09:03:00.000Z	Zack1403		hey can anyone help me out with how to deselect packages marked for install
2008-03-22T09:03:00.000Z	Zack1403		?
2008-03-22T09:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Zack1403	in synaptic?  or what?
2008-03-22T09:05:00.000Z	Zack1403	Flannel	well i was using apt-get
2008-03-22T09:05:00.000Z	Zack1403	Flannel	new to ubuntu
2008-03-22T09:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Zack1403	I don't understand your problem then.  You had something installed and now you want to remove it? or what?
2008-03-22T09:07:00.000Z	Zack1403	Flannel	by accident i did apt-get install b43*, it said a bunch of stuff is marked for install, will this stuff get installed on like a apt-get upgrade?
2008-03-22T09:07:00.000Z	Zack1403	Flannel	i was looking for the fc equivilant like yum search b43*
2008-03-22T09:07:00.000Z	Flannel	Zack1403	did you hit 'n' to cancel it?  you want apt-cache search [stuff],  but, why not use synaptic?
2008-03-22T09:08:00.000Z	Flannel	Zack1403	sudo apt-get -s update, will simulate, so you can double check that it wont
2008-03-22T09:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Zack1403	er, upgrade.  update refreshes your package.litss
2008-03-22T09:09:00.000Z	Zack1403	Flannel	it said that there were broken packages and ended, would i have to confirm before any install?
2008-03-22T09:09:00.000Z	Zack1403	Flannel	but it still said a bunch of packages were selected
2008-03-22T09:09:00.000Z	Zack1403	Flannel	 ill run the simulation
2008-03-22T09:10:00.000Z	Zack1403	Flannel	ok so it said 0 for everything, that means nothing will be installed right ? :)
2008-03-22T09:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Zack1403	uh, I don't know what '0 for everything' means, but sounds like it, yes.
2008-03-22T09:12:00.000Z	Zack1403	Flannel	0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
2008-03-22T09:12:00.000Z	Flannel	Zack1403	aye.  Looks good.
2008-03-22T09:12:00.000Z	Zack1403	Flannel	Glorious!
2008-03-22T09:12:00.000Z	Zack1403	Flannel	Thanks for your help, always paranoid im gonna bloat a new install with my stupidity
2008-03-22T09:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Zack1403	well, if its a fresh install, you can always reinstall.  But yeah, check synaptic out.
2008-03-22T09:13:00.000Z	Zack1403	Flannel	thanks!
