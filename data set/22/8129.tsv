2006-12-29T17:49:00.000Z	ken	gnomefreak	POVaddct: Is there a tutorial somewhere teaching one how to read man pages? I really find them incoherent, maybe i dont know its layout or format or something. Just know i wanted to do "chmod command" for a folder, but i forgot the syntax and the man page appeared too complicated :(
2006-12-29T17:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ken	try chmod --help?
