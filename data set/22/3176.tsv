2009-01-12T17:12:00.000Z	Cedara		Ocean: hi, it's me again - how do I change the rights so I can access the ntfs drive to write on them, now they're root
2009-01-12T17:13:00.000Z	Cedara		If anyone else knows, I'd welcome the help
2009-01-12T17:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cedara	how are you mounting the ntfs partition?
2009-01-12T17:13:00.000Z	Cedara	ActionParsnip	automatically in ubuntu
2009-01-12T17:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cedara	you need to use this guide, http://www.hafenscher.net/wiki/index.php?page=Mount_USB_stick_read_and_writable_for_users
2009-01-12T17:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cedara	just make sure you have ntfs-3g installed and change the prtition type to ntfs-3g in your mount command
2009-01-12T17:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cedara	you will not be able to rite to some files as they may have some permissions set, other files are ok
2009-01-12T17:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cedara	?
2009-01-12T17:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cedara	you'll need to run sudo fdisk -l to see which partition is the ntfs one to mount and replace it in the command
2009-01-12T17:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cedara	well whichever you wanna mount
2009-01-12T17:20:00.000Z	Cedara	ActionParsnip	jas
2009-01-12T17:21:00.000Z	Cedara	ActionParsnip	let's start with sda10  (http://paste.ubuntu.com/103886/)
2009-01-12T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cedara	if the partition is currently mounted, you wil be able to see it in the output of 'mount'
2009-01-12T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cedara	to mount it you will have to umount it (not unmount)
2009-01-12T17:22:00.000Z	Cedara	ActionParsnip	what'S the difference?
2009-01-12T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cedara	one will unmount the partition, the other doesnt exist
2009-01-12T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cedara	then simply replace the name of the partition and the mount point in the commands outlined in the link i gave you
2009-01-12T17:23:00.000Z	Cedara	ActionParsnip	Jas, lemme look
2009-01-12T17:27:00.000Z	Cedara	ActionParsnip	I know it's a stupid question, but how do I unmount manually?
2009-01-12T17:28:00.000Z	Cedara	ActionParsnip	I'm a relative newbie.
2009-01-12T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cedara	sudo umount /mount/point/name
2009-01-12T18:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cedara	read the guide, it will tell you how to mount stuff
