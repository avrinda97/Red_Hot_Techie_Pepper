2006-08-19T12:04:00.000Z	Audesse	teacordes	- try sudo locate -u, then sudo locate vmware
2006-08-19T12:05:00.000Z	teacordes	Audesse	i get a lot on this
2006-08-19T12:07:00.000Z	Audesse	teacordes	do you see one that says vmware-uninstall.pl?
2006-08-19T12:08:00.000Z	teacordes	Audesse	no there are only some debs
2006-08-19T12:08:00.000Z	teacordes	Audesse	but there is a folder /etc/vmware
2006-08-19T12:09:00.000Z	Audesse	teacordes	is the vmware folder empty?
2006-08-19T12:12:00.000Z	Audesse	teacordes	what do you get when you do ls -al /etc/vmware ?
2006-08-19T12:13:00.000Z	teacordes	Audesse	may i paste it here?
2006-08-19T12:13:00.000Z	Audesse	teacordes	yeah it shouldn't be a problem I don't think
2006-08-19T12:16:00.000Z	teacordes	Audesse	what does this tell me?
2006-08-19T12:17:00.000Z	Audesse	teacordes	I was hoping that the permissions were set up such that you couldn't write to those files even as root, but you can
2006-08-19T12:19:00.000Z	teacordes	Audesse	so what am i gonna do now? remove the folder and install again?
2006-08-19T12:21:00.000Z	Audesse	teacordes	I would try moving those files first
2006-08-19T12:21:00.000Z	teacordes	Audesse	because i could damage my system by removing them or why?
2006-08-19T12:22:00.000Z	Audesse	teacordes	yeah...maybe I'm just over-cautious haha
2006-08-19T12:26:00.000Z	teacordes	Audesse	i completly removed it. should i do anything else before reinstalling?
2006-08-19T12:28:00.000Z	Audesse	teacordes	I would go ahead and try reinstalling and see what happens
2006-08-19T12:29:00.000Z	teacordes	Audesse	what packets do i need? there vmware-player, vmware-player, vnware-player-kernel-module, vmware-player-kernel-modules-2.6.15-23 ?
2006-08-19T12:31:00.000Z	Audesse	teacordes	are you using synaptic?
2006-08-19T12:31:00.000Z	teacordes	Audesse	yes i do
2006-08-19T12:32:00.000Z	Audesse	teacordes	I've never used vmware, but I think you could probably just install them all and be okay
