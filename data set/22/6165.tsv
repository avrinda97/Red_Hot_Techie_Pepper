2007-04-28T09:01:00.000Z	hendrixski		how does email threading work in evolution?  I click on on view--> by thread... and I thought it's supposed to organize it ..Do I need to set up a thread before it can be done?  googling didn't give me anything I could understand
2007-04-28T09:02:00.000Z	hendrixski		actually.. i've never had any mail organized by thread before...I'm not familiar... could anyone explain it or point me to an explanation?
2007-04-28T09:03:00.000Z	eck	hendrixski	it will only work if the person responding to the thread has a compliant mail program... if you look at the email headers you will see some references lines, evolution uses that to determine where in the thread the email is
2007-04-28T09:03:00.000Z	eck	hendrixski	some mail programs (e.g. outlook express) will break the threading
2007-04-28T09:04:00.000Z	hendrixski	eck	cafuego,  oh.. so if the other person sends through evolution?
2007-04-28T09:04:00.000Z	hendrixski	eck	cafuego or if the other persons mail server supports threading?
2007-04-28T09:05:00.000Z	eck	hendrixski	outlook is the only thing that I know of that will break threading
2007-04-28T09:05:00.000Z	hendrixski	eck	cafuego, gmail does threading, right?
2007-04-28T09:06:00.000Z	eck	hendrixski	i believe so
2007-04-28T09:07:00.000Z	hendrixski	eck	cafuego sweet.  Thanks a lot.  That explained exactly what I was doing wrong.  I'll send to my friends gmail account instead..  :-)  Thank you :-)
2007-04-28T09:07:00.000Z	eck	hendrixski	that is, it is compliant with threading, the message view in gmail is not threaded
2007-04-28T09:08:00.000Z	hendrixski	eck	oh... :-(  well... I dunno if it's important for them... I just send a lot of correspondences, and want it organized by topic on my box
2007-04-28T09:08:00.000Z	hendrixski	eck	thanks again :-)
2007-05-11T15:09:00.000Z	eck	hendrixski	i usually just tab complete
2007-05-11T15:08:00.000Z	eck	hendrixski	fork?
2007-05-11T15:08:00.000Z	hendrixski	eck	oh man... that would be a lot of message passing.... is there a wrapper framework of any sort?
2007-05-11T15:09:00.000Z	hendrixski	eck	tab complete with fork??
2007-05-11T15:10:00.000Z	eck	hendrixski	oops, wrong person. uh, you would want to use a socket
2007-05-11T15:10:00.000Z	eck	hendrixski	there are some ipc frameworks for python, i'm not sure how well they work
2007-05-11T15:11:00.000Z	eck	hendrixski	it will be easiest if you are doing xmlrpc to communicate over the socket, but you can define any sort of message passing system you want
2007-05-11T15:11:00.000Z	eck	hendrixski	at least that would be easy from python, i'm not sure what the C++ apis for that look like
2007-05-11T15:12:00.000Z	hendrixski	eck	I C.  I'll look into those.... sweet   thanks.  :-)
