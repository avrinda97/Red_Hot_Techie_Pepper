2005-08-25T05:26:00.000Z	black13		has anyone ever had the error "UDF-fs: no partition found (1) Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: unable to mount root fs on unknonw-block(1,0)"
2005-08-25T05:26:00.000Z	LinuxJones	black13	did you compile your own kernel ?
2005-08-25T05:27:00.000Z	black13	LinuxJones	yes
2005-08-25T05:27:00.000Z	LinuxJones	black13	man do you HAVE to compile your own kernel ?
2005-08-25T05:27:00.000Z	black13	LinuxJones	not if there is a better way
2005-08-25T05:28:00.000Z	black13	LinuxJones	i can be hard-headed up to apoint but finally i will listen to reason
2005-08-25T05:28:00.000Z	LinuxJones	black13	you are on a path that is frought with danger :)
2005-08-25T05:29:00.000Z	black13	LinuxJones	what were your thoughts?
2005-08-25T05:31:00.000Z	LinuxJones	black13	if a stock Ubuntu kernel works ok for you and you don't need to compile for extra functionality jsut use the stock kernel. It will create alot of work that is not necessary.
2005-08-25T05:32:00.000Z	black13	LinuxJones	unfortunately i need squasfs
2005-08-25T05:34:00.000Z	LinuxJones	black13	you will be compiling every kernel when a security problem arises and associated modules like 3rd party drivers each time as well :(
2005-08-25T05:36:00.000Z	LinuxJones	black13	all of that stuff is done for you but the nice folks in the Ubuntu devel team. All you have to do is keep your system upgraded regularly.
2005-08-25T05:38:00.000Z	LinuxJones	black13	what is that ?
2005-08-25T05:39:00.000Z	black13	LinuxJones	(god i love that name) how do i go about getting a 2.6 kernel with squashfs support via the apt-get proces?
2005-08-25T05:42:00.000Z	LinuxJones	black13	I am not sure if you can patch or compile a module for your kernel with that functionality. Maybe you could ask in #ubuntu-devel, Explain your situation and ask for advise...someone may have pitty on you :)
2005-08-25T05:43:00.000Z	black13	LinuxJones	... ok ill take this tact ... just get the kernel to work first without the udf-fs errors then worry about patching it
2005-08-25T05:45:00.000Z	black13	LinuxJones	what are the commands to build the kernel?
2005-08-25T05:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	black13	you can also request functionality to be added to a stock kernel, the developers are very good about things like that, they want to keep their user base happy :)
2005-08-25T05:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	black13	that's a long process :D
2005-08-25T05:52:00.000Z	black13	LinuxJones	what make-kpkg
2005-08-26T05:23:00.000Z	black13	LinuxJones	hey i was able to build a working 2.6 kernel
2005-08-26T05:23:00.000Z	LinuxJones	black13	that's a good thing to know
