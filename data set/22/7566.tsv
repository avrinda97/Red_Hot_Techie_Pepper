2006-06-06T13:05:00.000Z	Fujitsu		!info libquicktime1 dapper
2006-06-06T13:05:00.000Z	Fujitsu		Ops.
2006-06-06T13:05:00.000Z	Fujitsu		You already said that...
2006-06-06T13:06:00.000Z	Fujitsu		Err, where'd it go, bimberi?
2006-06-06T13:06:00.000Z	Fujitsu		It's gone.
2006-06-06T13:06:00.000Z	Fujitsu		How odd.
2006-06-06T13:06:00.000Z	Fujitsu		libquicktime0
2006-06-06T13:06:00.000Z	Fujitsu		libquicktime-dev
2006-06-06T13:07:00.000Z	Fujitsu		What in particular, BrianG?
2006-06-06T13:07:00.000Z	Fujitsu		Hi, painkiler.
2006-06-06T13:07:00.000Z	BrianG	Fujitsu	i just don't feel like ther documentation and stuff is on.. i remember when i had 504 there was tons of information and teps to get things working
2006-06-06T13:08:00.000Z	BrianG		maybe it's still too early
2006-06-06T13:08:00.000Z	BrianG		i have 0, i'm looking for 1
2006-06-06T13:08:00.000Z	Fujitsu	BrianG	there's a lot less manual stuff required in Dapper, so less docs are necessary, I guess.
2006-06-06T13:08:00.000Z	BrianG		i have no sound from .mov files
2006-06-06T13:08:00.000Z	BrianG		i don't get mov files playing in firefox
2006-06-06T13:08:00.000Z	Fujitsu	BrianG	I have no idea where libquicktime1 went...
2006-06-06T13:09:00.000Z	Fujitsu		No problem, freaks.
2006-06-06T13:09:00.000Z	BrianG		i guess it dosen't matter, i bet it won't even fix whats wrong once i get it anyhow
2006-06-06T13:10:00.000Z	Fujitsu		libquicktime0 seems to replace libquicktime1
2006-06-06T13:10:00.000Z	Fujitsu		libquicktime0 explicitly replaces libquicktime1! Thus, there's no need for libquicktime1
2006-06-06T13:11:00.000Z	BrianG	Fujitsu	tell ubotu that
