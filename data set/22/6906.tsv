2009-01-06T01:24:00.000Z	StuckMojo	hwilde	the only way i was able to get it to turn off, despite trying all the methods on the forums, was to change /usr/bin/pulseaudio to a symlink to /bin/true
2009-01-06T01:25:00.000Z	StuckMojo	hwilde	which gets overwritten every time the pulse packages get upgraded
2009-01-06T01:25:00.000Z	hwilde	StuckMojo	if you are really sure that's what you want to do....    sudo apt-get remove --purge pulseaudio
2009-01-06T01:25:00.000Z	StuckMojo	hwilde	for some reason gnome-session starts it even if you've got disabled in /etc/X11/Xsession.d
2009-01-06T01:26:00.000Z	hwilde	StuckMojo	not if you remove --purge it.
2009-01-06T01:26:00.000Z	StuckMojo	hwilde	yeah problem with that is about 40 packages in gnome depend on it
2009-01-06T01:26:00.000Z	StuckMojo	hwilde	well...actually it's only the metapackage ubuntu-desktop
2009-01-06T01:27:00.000Z	StuckMojo	hwilde	but removing that will screw up upgrades and such
2009-01-06T01:27:00.000Z	StuckMojo	hwilde	running pulse screws up my mixer, which is why i don't want it. my card processes multiple streams just fine, i don't need a sound server
2009-01-06T01:28:00.000Z	hwilde	StuckMojo	I have told you how to remove it completely if that's what you want to do
2009-01-06T01:29:00.000Z	StuckMojo	hwilde	i'd just like to find out the proper way to tell the system i don't want to use it. removing it completely causes dependency issues
2009-01-06T01:29:00.000Z	StuckMojo	hwilde	but thanks
2009-01-06T01:30:00.000Z	hwilde	StuckMojo	read the link from ubottu about alsa.  it explains how to set alsa as the default
