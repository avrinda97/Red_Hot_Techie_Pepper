2005-10-22T14:14:00.000Z	nalioth	batman	if you've got 'build-essential' installed and are still getting that, then you'll need to read more closely the docs
2005-10-24T09:47:00.000Z	nalioth	batman	in linux you have no worries for those things
2005-10-24T09:48:00.000Z	batman	nalioth	are you sure about that?
2005-10-24T09:48:00.000Z	nalioth	batman	i've been using linux since 97 and never have seen a need for any of that stuff
2005-10-24T09:49:00.000Z	nalioth	batman	some folks run 'clamav' on their inbound connections so they dont send out any virusses they've unknowingly gotten

2005-12-27T11:18:00.000Z	nalioth	batman	if you open a console and use apt t0 intall that, it'll tell you the file that replaces it
