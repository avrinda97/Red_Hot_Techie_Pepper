2005-12-29T08:53:00.000Z	yanis		hello
2005-12-29T08:54:00.000Z	yanis		how do I format a new usb hard disc?
2005-12-29T08:55:00.000Z	pvanhoof	yanis	that's for an LVM2 setup
2005-12-29T08:56:00.000Z	pvanhoof	yanis	these days I recommend using LVM2
2005-12-29T08:57:00.000Z	pvanhoof	yanis	yea well, then learn it ;)
2005-12-29T08:57:00.000Z	pvanhoof	yanis	yes
2005-12-29T08:57:00.000Z	pvanhoof	yanis	every modern linux distro these days creates a LVM2 for / by default
2005-12-29T08:57:00.000Z	pvanhoof	yanis	Ubuntu, for example, does it
2005-12-29T08:58:00.000Z	pvanhoof	yanis	and it's indeed a lot more powerfull if you want to make triping raids, mirror raids, let it grow add, delete volumnes, do snapshot backups
2005-12-29T08:59:00.000Z	yanis	pvanhoof	it's a simple usb exteran hdd
2005-12-29T08:59:00.000Z	pvanhoof	yanis	that's perfect for lvm2
2005-12-29T08:59:00.000Z	pvanhoof	yanis	however .. if you want to use it on Windows ... you're only option is to use VFAT
2005-12-29T09:00:00.000Z	yanis	pvanhoof	I use ext2win
2005-12-29T09:00:00.000Z	pvanhoof	yanis	that might not work with LVM2
2005-12-29T09:01:00.000Z	yanis	pvanhoof	is there any tool to read it from windows?
2005-12-29T09:01:00.000Z	yanis	pvanhoof	for LVM2
2005-12-29T09:01:00.000Z	pvanhoof	yanis	you'll have to check the LVM2 docs for that
2005-12-29T09:03:00.000Z	pvanhoof	yanis	if you can go for LVM2, go for it. It's the future of volume management in Linux
2005-12-29T09:04:00.000Z	yanis	pvanhoof	I hope :P
2005-12-29T09:04:00.000Z	pvanhoof	yanis	it is. And it's powerfull .. and some day you'll do virtualisation with xen .. and you'll love it
2005-12-29T09:05:00.000Z	pvanhoof	yanis	btw, you'll love both xen and LVM2. They are a great combo
2005-12-29T09:06:00.000Z	pvanhoof	yanis	you'll know when time comes
