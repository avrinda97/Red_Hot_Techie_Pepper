2008-06-26T17:55:00.000Z	RAdams		﻿Dunas: your problem lies in line 56 of the nvidia-xconfig generated conf. It seems to believe your board is vesa-compatible, not nvidia. Is your card integrated or dedicated, and what system is it on?
2008-06-26T17:57:00.000Z	RAdams		﻿barjoman: by default, the first user you create for the system has sudo privs, so I'm not sure what happened there. You could try an Ubuntu live cd, that would let you mount the system and modify your sudoers file, albeit uncleanly
2008-06-26T17:58:00.000Z	RAdams		good luck barjoman
2008-06-26T17:59:00.000Z	wols	RAdams	it's a simple integrated nvidia chipset
2008-06-26T17:59:00.000Z	RAdams	wols	yes, i know
2008-06-26T18:00:00.000Z	RAdams	wols	there's a specific set of motherboards with integrated nvidia chips in the same family as his that have a long-standing problem, I want to see if that is the case here
2008-06-26T18:00:00.000Z	wols	RAdams	then ask for the lspci output
2008-06-26T18:01:00.000Z	RAdams	wols	doesn't give me the motherboard model 70% of the time
2008-06-26T18:01:00.000Z	wols	RAdams	lspci never does. but usually lshw does
2008-06-26T18:01:00.000Z	wols	RAdams	but since it's an acer you woN't get the mobo model anyways. it's a Acer OEM
2008-06-26T18:01:00.000Z	wols	RAdams	a GF7100 is never a nf4
2008-06-26T18:01:00.000Z	RAdams	wols	i meant using hardware querying period, sorry I wasn't more specific
2008-06-26T18:02:00.000Z	RAdams	wols	you're sure that his motherboard doesn't use the n4 then?
2008-06-26T18:02:00.000Z	wols	RAdams	I asked you to use lspci then which you dismissed for no good reason. if it's nf4, lspci will tell you. BUT: no one sells current PCs with nf4 since a few years now
2008-06-26T18:03:00.000Z	wols	RAdams	so yes, it's not a NF4 with a E2160 in it...
2008-06-26T18:07:00.000Z	RAdams	wols	I didn't dismiss lspci outright, I only said it wasn't likely to give the info needed. I didn't know how recent his computer was, nor do I have an intimate enough knowledge of nvidia cards to know offhand which are in which set. Thanks for the info :)
2008-06-26T18:07:00.000Z	wols	RAdams	it ALWAYS gives the chipset info. ALWAYS
2008-06-26T18:07:00.000Z	RAdams	wols	is his graphics chipset not able to use nvidia-glx at all then?
2008-06-26T18:07:00.000Z	RAdams	wols	because that would be odd
2008-06-26T18:08:00.000Z	wols	RAdams	it is. but we need the output from a testrun where he uses nvidia, not VESA. can't diagnose nvidia problems when the VESA driver is used, can we?
2008-06-26T18:08:00.000Z	RAdams	wols	of course :) but i thought it was odd that nvidia-xconfig was identifying the board as vesa
2008-06-26T18:18:00.000Z	RAdams	wols	thanks for the infos!
