2007-06-23T15:24:00.000Z	Ireal	vecina	use it on the binary, it should give you an overview of the libs it needs including a path
2007-06-23T15:24:00.000Z	vecina	Ireal	seriously? hmm
2007-06-23T15:24:00.000Z	Ireal	vecina	no i'm making this up :)
2007-06-23T15:26:00.000Z	vecina	Ireal	so, lets see... i have the package. i should install that first?
2007-06-23T15:26:00.000Z	vecina	Ireal	does it matter that the package explicitly says "i386" in its name when im 64 ? :/
2007-06-23T15:27:00.000Z	Ireal	vecina	on the binary you're trying to start not the .deb package
2007-06-23T15:28:00.000Z	vecina	Ireal	Oh... if i install it ill have to overwrite moblock, but i dunno if thats working anyway... its log is very... static :/
2007-06-23T15:30:00.000Z	vecina	Ireal	is there any way i can check to see first whether or not "moblock" is getting the job done? the log file is just a few lines saying its started up
2007-06-23T15:31:00.000Z	Ireal	vecina	i have no idea what you're trying todo, i just read your ncurses problem ;)
