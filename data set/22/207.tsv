2012-03-30T17:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	yzhd	it look like this should install it sudo apt-get install lm-sensors
2012-03-30T17:57:00.000Z	yzhd	sacarlson	it doesn't work
2012-03-30T17:58:00.000Z	yzhd	sacarlson	I have downloaded the tar.gz, I'm going to install it via terminal, but I need some additional files to make it work. Since I'm a newb.. I can't find them.. could you hep me ?
2012-03-30T17:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	yzhd	what error do you get from sudo apt-get install lm-sensors ?
2012-03-30T18:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	yzhd	try sudo sensors-detect
2012-03-30T18:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	yzhd	and see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SensorInstallHowto
2012-03-30T18:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	yzhd	from that I would guess it's working then
2012-03-30T18:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	yzhd	you can now install one of the gui apps or applets to view it on your screen
2012-03-30T18:06:00.000Z	yzhd	sacarlson	but I can't find sensors-applet
2012-03-30T18:07:00.000Z	yzhd	sacarlson	I want it to show on my panel
2012-03-30T18:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	yzhd	did you install it?
2012-03-30T18:07:00.000Z	yzhd	sacarlson	yes
2012-03-30T18:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	yzhd	if so what error did you get from that install sudo apt-get install  sensors-applet
2012-03-30T18:08:00.000Z	yzhd	sacarlson	I don't get any errors, but I can't find it ?
2012-03-30T18:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	yzhd	what are you looking for that you can't find?
2012-03-30T18:09:00.000Z	yzhd	sacarlson	sensors-applet.
2012-03-30T18:09:00.000Z	yzhd	sacarlson	How can I make it show my computer temperature on my panel ?
2012-03-30T18:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	yzhd	read the link as it point out Finally, restart to load all the sensors. Once back at the desktop,  right-click on the top panel and choose "Add to Panel." Select "Hardware  Sensors Monitor" and click the "Add" button,
2012-03-30T18:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	yzhd	but you should read above that as well
2012-03-30T18:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	yzhd	maybe that applet is too old?
2012-03-30T18:11:00.000Z	yzhd	sacarlson	can I PM you ?
2012-03-30T18:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	yzhd	if so try ksensors
