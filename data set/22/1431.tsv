2012-09-04T04:40:00.000Z	TJ-	jamar	Let me see what happens here, wait a couple of minutes
2012-09-04T04:43:00.000Z	TJ-	jamar	Inserting an empty disc there are no messages to kern.log ... I'll try a disc with content now
2012-09-04T04:45:00.000Z	TJ-	jamar	hylian: an Ubuntu live CD gives 2 messages in kern.log and syslog: "Sep  4 01:44:47 hephaestion kernel: [39818.983517] ISO 9660 Extensions: Microsoft Joliet Level 3, Sep  4 01:44:47 hephaestion kernel: [39819.099527] ISO 9660 Extensions: RRIP_1991A"
2012-09-04T04:46:00.000Z	TJ-	jamar	The disc you're inserting, is it one you've burned yourself? If so, did you burn it on a different PC?
2012-09-04T04:48:00.000Z	TJ-	jamar	Is it a movie DVD? with encryption?
2012-09-04T04:50:00.000Z	TJ-	jamar	hylian: For a movie DVD I see this in kern.log: "Sep  4 01:49:50 hephaestion kernel: [40121.603513] UDF-fs: Partition marked readonly; forcing readonly mount ...  Sep  4 01:49:50 hephaestion kernel: [40121.661083] UDF-fs: INFO Mounting volume 'SHREK', timestamp 2001/09/19 05:40 (103c)"
2012-09-04T04:53:00.000Z	TJ-	jamar	So, let's be clear. The PC has ubuntu on that was installed from a USb flash drive using unetbootlin, and how you're having problems loading a movie studio's original movie DVD?
2012-09-04T04:53:00.000Z	TJ-	jamar	s/how you're/now you're/
2012-09-04T04:54:00.000Z	TJ-	jamar	So in summary then, you've got a FAULTY DVD drive that even Windows couldn't use!
2012-09-04T04:54:00.000Z	TJ-	jamar	It's a CD-RW drive that Windows couldn't use?
2012-09-04T04:56:00.000Z	TJ-	jamar	Sounds like the physical drive has a fault to me
2012-09-04T04:58:00.000Z	TJ-	jamar	hylian: usr13 I'm seeing lots of hits for the "DVDRAM GSA-T20L" drive and "problem disappeared"
2012-09-04T04:59:00.000Z	TJ-	jamar	The fact Ubuntu/Linux reports the drive info accurately suggests the operating system can talk to the drive, but when it comes to reading media, the drive is somehow faulty
2012-09-04T05:02:00.000Z	TJ-	jamar	hylian usr13 I found this: http://www.computing.net/answers/hardware/bad-dvd-drive/82269.html
2012-09-04T05:03:00.000Z	TJ-	jamar	hylian usr13 I also found this "A similar problem was recently solved by adjusting the Drive Configuration in the BIOS to "Configure SATA as IDE" rather than AHCI. Some of the recent SATA and IDE controllers have been identified as the problem."
