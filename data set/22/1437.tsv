2010-11-01T15:31:00.000Z	dshbusiness		Hello, guys. I have a problem. I can't get some web page such as www.google.com, if I had turn my computer on 48 hours or more. Why? How to solve it?
2010-11-01T15:32:00.000Z	dshbusiness		And if I restart my computer, problems gone.
2010-11-01T15:33:00.000Z	burhan	dshbusiness	are you saying that after 48 hours your Internet stops working?
2010-11-01T15:34:00.000Z	dshbusiness	burhan	NO. network still working. I just cannot get some certain website. For example, www.google.com.
2010-11-01T15:34:00.000Z	burhan	dshbusiness	what is the error you get?
2010-11-01T15:35:00.000Z	dshbusiness	burhan	time out
2010-11-01T15:35:00.000Z	burhan	dshbusiness	this sounds like a restriction from your network and has nothing to do with Ubuntu.
2010-11-01T15:36:00.000Z	dshbusiness	burhan	Perhaps. I can ping www.google.com, but could not get the page. Other pages are ok.
2010-11-01T15:37:00.000Z	burhan	dshbusiness	the only thing that could affect this is ipv6 for DNS lookups.
2010-11-01T15:37:00.000Z	burhan	dshbusiness	you could disable that.
2010-11-01T15:38:00.000Z	dshbusiness	burhan	I use ipv4. Let me have a try. Thanks
2010-11-01T15:39:00.000Z	burhan	dshbusiness	ipv6 is enabled by default and this can cause web browsing issues if your DNS resolver is not ipv6 enabled.
2010-11-01T15:40:00.000Z	dshbusiness	burhan	could this take effect immediately after I disabled ipv6?
2010-11-01T15:40:00.000Z	burhan	dshbusiness	if this was the issue, then yes.
2010-11-01T15:40:00.000Z	dshbusiness	burhan	I hope so. Thanks.
2010-11-01T15:43:00.000Z	dshbusiness	burhan	Oh, it seems that I have to restart my computer after I disable ipv6?
2010-11-01T15:43:00.000Z	burhan	dshbusiness	could be.
2010-11-01T15:45:00.000Z	dshbusiness	burhan	but things will be right after I have restart it, wether or not I have disabled ipv6. perhaps I have to wait for 2 full days to prove this will work : )
2010-11-01T15:46:00.000Z	burhan	dshbusiness	again, I don't think this has to do with ipv6 - it is the only thing that could possibly affect browsing. I think this is a restriction from your ISP.
2010-11-01T15:49:00.000Z	dshbusiness	burhan	Oh, I wish this will take effect. If it is a restriction from my isp, why I can visit most other page, except only a few pages?
2010-11-01T15:50:00.000Z	burhan	dshbusiness	who knows, maybe it could be a buggy implementation?
2010-11-01T15:51:00.000Z	dshbusiness	burhan	: ) It make me headache. I hope I can visit google 48 hours later. many thanks!
