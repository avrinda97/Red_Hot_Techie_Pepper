2008-11-01T10:32:00.000Z	gusx_		ldapwhoami dont use the specified SASL_MECH GSSAPI configured in ldap.conf ... anyone knows why ?
2008-11-01T10:32:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	i'm pretty mad at ldap right now
2008-11-01T10:34:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	then there's the whole cn=config thing, with the pain related to loading schemas
2008-11-01T10:35:00.000Z	gusx_	rdw200169	u know if is there a way to specify the preferred method of the slapd service ?
2008-11-01T10:35:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	what do you mean?
2008-11-01T10:37:00.000Z	gusx_	rdw200169	in the man pages of xxx utils in the -Y option says "itâ€™s not specified, the program will choose the best mechanism the server knows"
2008-11-01T10:38:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	you mean, the authentication mechanism?
2008-11-01T10:40:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	what a pain!
2008-11-01T10:42:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	yeah, i don't know either
2008-11-01T10:43:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	i'm usually just happy when i can figure out how to get the darn ldap thing working the way i want it to
2008-11-01T10:43:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	i haven't even tried to figure out how to get it working with tickets and kerberos and all that
2008-11-01T10:44:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	it's part of a project i'm working on for tracking user accounts: greamin.com/server
2008-11-01T10:49:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	yeah, it's a mess; i want to use ldap to track passwords (simple passwords, none of that kerberos hell)
2008-11-01T10:50:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	across radius, ftp, http, etc..
2008-11-01T10:50:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	i see ldap to be the way to integrate ip address management, for example, across coovachilli (radius) and dhcp
2008-11-01T10:51:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	because i'm not the one running the server, my friend rich is, who is not very good with linux
2008-11-01T10:51:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	so, i'm trying to set up ldap to store all the special information he will need to change
2008-11-01T10:51:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	for the different ISP subscribers
2008-11-01T10:52:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	so the People subdirectory in ldap would be all he had to mess with for everything
2008-11-01T10:53:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	so if he wants to change a subscribers bandwidth allowance, for example, it would be easy, to include changing a password, ip, internet gateway, etc...
2008-11-01T10:57:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	what?
2008-11-01T10:58:00.000Z	rdw200169	gusx_	i'm having trouble talking to you in this quickly scrolling window, talk over here
