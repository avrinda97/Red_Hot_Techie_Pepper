2010-09-12T15:27:00.000Z	raxbg		i can connect to the network and in terminal i can ping every domain and it resolvs the ip corectly and the package manager works but other apps cant resolv any dns and i cant use firefox for example or pidgin. what might be the problem? the other weird thing is that when i connect to another router everything works it dont work just on mine. but my old mint didn't had any problems and my windows is also connecting good. any ideas?
2010-09-12T15:28:00.000Z	usr13	raxbg	sounds like you are missing nameserver address. Look to see what is in /etc/resolv.conf
2010-09-12T15:28:00.000Z	raxbg	usr13	 its fine
2010-09-12T15:30:00.000Z	usr13	raxbg	Maybe it is just very slow speed
2010-09-12T15:31:00.000Z	raxbg	usr13	no its not as i said it works perfectly on my windows and on my linux mind
2010-09-12T15:32:00.000Z	usr13	raxbg	What you say does not make sense.
2010-09-12T15:32:00.000Z	raxbg	usr13	this is why i said its weird :)
2010-09-12T15:33:00.000Z	usr13	raxbg	Unless it is an intermitten problem.  Check your network cable.
2010-09-12T15:33:00.000Z	raxbg	usr13	its wireless when i connet with the cable it just work
2010-09-12T15:33:00.000Z	usr13	raxbg	Maybe something wrong with the physical connection
2010-09-12T15:33:00.000Z	raxbg	usr13	but it doesnt want to work with the wireless
2010-09-12T15:34:00.000Z	usr13	raxbg	oh, wireless.
2010-09-12T15:34:00.000Z	raxbg	usr13	i can ping any domain so it resolvs right? and i can use my package manager and i can download files in terminal
2010-09-12T15:34:00.000Z	usr13	raxbg	Check the essid and see if it matches the wireless router you are supposed to be connected to.
2010-09-12T15:34:00.000Z	raxbg	usr13	but i cant use any app different from terminal or package manager
2010-09-12T15:35:00.000Z	usr13	raxbg	What does iwconfig say?
2010-09-12T15:36:00.000Z	usr13	raxbg	Link Quality=??/??
2010-09-12T15:36:00.000Z	raxbg	usr13	im in windows now because my father needs the cable
2010-09-12T15:37:00.000Z	raxbg	usr13	:(
2010-09-12T15:37:00.000Z	raxbg	usr13	but the signal strenght is fairly good
2010-09-12T15:38:00.000Z	usr13	raxbg	Do  you have iptables rules that may be blocking certain services?
2010-09-12T15:38:00.000Z	raxbg	usr13	idk i suppose not because its a clean installation
