2011-02-28T23:42:00.000Z	endlesspuddingcu		Does anyone know how to change a /dev/sdb1 filesystem back into sda? Because it changed for some reason
2011-02-28T23:42:00.000Z	jrib	endlesspuddingcu	just use UUIDs
2011-02-28T23:43:00.000Z	endlesspuddingcu	jrib	can you tell me how to do that?
2011-02-28T23:44:00.000Z	jrib	endlesspuddingcu	why did sda1 becoming sdb1 affect you?  What were you trying to accomplish?
2011-02-28T23:45:00.000Z	endlesspuddingcu	jrib	it changed without me doing anything, and now I can't mount the filesystem anymore, so I'm guessing it's because of that. I'm using the livecd now to fix it
2011-02-28T23:45:00.000Z	jrib	endlesspuddingcu	the issue is with your fstab?
2011-02-28T23:46:00.000Z	endlesspuddingcu	jrib	i'm guessing it is
2011-02-28T23:47:00.000Z	jrib	endlesspuddingcu	then just replace /dev/sda1 with UUID=longstringofcharactersthatcomposeyouruuid
2011-02-28T23:47:00.000Z	endlesspuddingcu	jrib	where?
2011-02-28T23:47:00.000Z	jrib	endlesspuddingcu	in /etc/fstab
2011-02-28T23:48:00.000Z	jrib	endlesspuddingcu	if you're not sure the issue is there, then it could be grub
2011-02-28T23:49:00.000Z	endlesspuddingcu	jrib	but I can't access /etc/fstab because I can't mount my hard disk
2011-02-28T23:49:00.000Z	jrib	endlesspuddingcu	why not?
2011-02-28T23:50:00.000Z	endlesspuddingcu	jrib	because I don't know. I think because it changed from sda to sdb
2011-02-28T23:50:00.000Z	jrib	endlesspuddingcu	why would that matter?  Just use sdb1 instead of sda1 to mount it
2011-02-28T23:50:00.000Z	endlesspuddingcu	jrib	but how?
2011-02-28T23:50:00.000Z	jrib	endlesspuddingcu	use a live cd
2011-02-28T23:51:00.000Z	endlesspuddingcu	jrib	I am using one right now
2011-02-28T23:51:00.000Z	endlesspuddingcu	jrib	I can't check and repair the disk using GParted, it gives me errors
2011-02-28T23:51:00.000Z	jrib	endlesspuddingcu	I didn't tell you to, I'm not even sure what that does
2011-02-28T23:52:00.000Z	endlesspuddingcu	jrib	normally it makes me able to mount the disk again
2011-02-28T23:54:00.000Z	jrib	endlesspuddingcu	so what happens when you try to mount the disk now?  Use a pastebin
