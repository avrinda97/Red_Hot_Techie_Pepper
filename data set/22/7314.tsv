2007-06-24T08:52:00.000Z	ferronica	DarthShrine	I tried but didnt found option for it.
2007-06-24T08:53:00.000Z	DarthShrine	ferronica	Run `avant-applets` and look for "Workspace switcher" in that.
2007-06-24T08:53:00.000Z	ferronica	DarthShrine	okay
2007-06-24T08:54:00.000Z	ferronica	DarthShrine	thanx it worked

2007-06-24T08:56:00.000Z	DarthShrine	ferronica	Essentially, yes.
2007-06-24T08:57:00.000Z	ferronica	DarthShrine	oh ok i thought both are different GNOME-DOCK and CAIRO-DOCK
2007-06-24T08:58:00.000Z	DarthShrine	ferronica	Gnome-dock is a continuation of Cairo-dock, I think.
