2009-11-21T09:09:00.000Z	caleb2003		hi can anyone help with workgroups/samba? I installed initially kde but switched to gnome desktop as some things were not working but since then I cannot see the workgroup from my xbox or windows laptops
2009-11-21T09:10:00.000Z	chuckf	caleb2003	is samba running?
2009-11-21T09:11:00.000Z	caleb2003		as far as i know, yes
2009-11-21T09:11:00.000Z	caleb2003		status activated in gadmin
2009-11-21T09:12:00.000Z	chuckf	caleb2003	can you pastebin the smb.conf file?

2009-11-21T09:20:00.000Z	caleb2003		CHUCKF: did you get it?
2009-11-21T09:20:00.000Z	caleb2003		<chuckf: I'm using xchat-gnome and see no option to pastebin
2009-11-21T09:20:00.000Z	caleb2003	chuckf	try here now http://pastebin.com/m2a241e32
2009-11-21T09:25:00.000Z	chuckf	caleb2003	and this same conf file was working before?
2009-11-21T09:25:00.000Z	caleb2003		yes I have not changed anything
2009-11-21T09:26:00.000Z	chuckf	caleb2003	does your log file show any errors?
2009-11-21T09:28:00.000Z	caleb2003	chuckf	there is no log file in the etc/samba folder do you mean somewhere else?
2009-11-21T09:28:00.000Z	chuckf	caleb2003	in /var/log/samba
2009-11-21T09:30:00.000Z	caleb2003	chuckf	http://pastebin.com/m74e90498 I appended it to the conf
2009-11-21T09:30:00.000Z	caleb2003	chuckf	from line 148
2009-11-21T09:32:00.000Z	chuckf	caleb2003	I'm only seeing through line 146
2009-11-21T09:33:00.000Z	caleb2003	chuckf	try this one http://pastebin.com/m479bb976
2009-11-21T09:46:00.000Z	chuckf	caleb2003	the file looks right. I'm thinking that maybe there's a firewall setting or something in the network setup
2009-11-21T09:47:00.000Z	caleb2003	chuckf	I'm trying to access the shares from an original xbox through xbmc there is no firewall and it did work fine with KDE
2009-11-21T09:49:00.000Z	chuckf		are the ports open on the samba server?
2009-11-21T09:50:00.000Z	caleb2003	chuckf	yes
