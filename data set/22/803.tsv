2011-03-10T05:34:00.000Z	alphonso		i've been getting that
2011-03-10T05:34:00.000Z	alphonso		which nvidia card do you have?
2011-03-10T05:34:00.000Z	alphonso		runaway: i've been getting the same thing with an old ati driver
2011-03-10T05:35:00.000Z	alphonso		runaway: what version of ubunto do you have?
2011-03-10T05:35:00.000Z	runawayhacker	alphonso	: I'm using latest official driver too
2011-03-10T05:35:00.000Z	alphonso		ruanawayhacker: have you tried removing some of the packages associated with the driver but not the driver itself?
2011-03-10T05:36:00.000Z	runawayhacker	alphonso	: such as?
2011-03-10T05:36:00.000Z	alphonso	runawayhacker	not sure b/c i don't have your card... but for ati there is a catalyst control center
2011-03-10T05:36:00.000Z	alphonso	runawayhacker	when i remove it, re-booting seems to be more reliable.
2011-03-10T05:37:00.000Z	runawayhacker	alphonso	: one time I did do a cleanup one time of everything - including open source drivers
2011-03-10T05:37:00.000Z	alphonso	runawayhacker	no luck, huh?
2011-03-10T05:37:00.000Z	runawayhacker	alphonso	: problem still persists
2011-03-10T05:37:00.000Z	runawayhacker	alphonso	: it's not a BIIg deal just annoying as hell
2011-03-10T05:38:00.000Z	alphonso	runawayhacker	i hear you - it has been annoying me for awhile.  i figured it was because i have a legacy vid card
2011-03-10T05:38:00.000Z	alphonso	runawayhacker	but i think yours is a bit newer
2011-03-10T05:38:00.000Z	runawayhacker	alphonso	: pretty sure it is
2011-03-10T05:38:00.000Z	runawayhacker	alphonso	: none the less, it is still a problem.
2011-03-10T05:39:00.000Z	alphonso	runawayhacker	yes, i'm about to upgrade to an ati hd so hopefully that will fix it for me.
2011-03-10T05:39:00.000Z	runawayhacker	alphonso	: I've had a lot of bad luck with ATI GPUs, that's why I switched to NVIDIA. I wish you luck
2011-03-10T05:39:00.000Z	runawayhacker	alphonso	: at least in Linux with ATI
2011-03-10T05:40:00.000Z	alphonso		ruanwayhacker: thanks, i'll need it - i'm invested in ati now.  maybe i'll have to switch up, though.
2011-03-10T05:40:00.000Z	runawayhacker	alphonso	: cool. good luck. I'm out
