2011-03-22T09:06:00.000Z	medfly		X failed to start on boot all of a sudden. :( I think it's a failed update or so.
2011-03-22T09:06:00.000Z	medfly		how do I do those updates without X running?
2011-03-22T09:07:00.000Z	medfly		oh yeah okay just found it too, thanks
2011-03-22T09:07:00.000Z	medfly		this is really horrible panicking in 3,2...
2011-03-22T09:08:00.000Z	medfly		nope :(
2011-03-22T09:09:00.000Z	medfly		has sanyone had any problems like that here lately?
2011-03-22T09:09:00.000Z	medfly		X not starting.
2011-03-22T09:10:00.000Z	soreau	medfly	Can you boot into recovery mode?
2011-03-22T09:12:00.000Z	soreau	medfly	sudo apt-get remove fglrx && sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf && sudo reboot
2011-03-22T09:12:00.000Z	soreau	medfly	That should get X starting at least
2011-03-22T09:13:00.000Z	medfly	soreau	thanks dude
2011-03-22T09:19:00.000Z	medfly	soreau	should I do a bug report? I didn't do anything too special to cause it (except updating packages)
2011-03-22T09:20:00.000Z	soreau	medfly	Did X start?
2011-03-22T09:20:00.000Z	medfly	soreau	it did now
2011-03-22T09:20:00.000Z	soreau	medfly	Don't get halfway through a driver install and expect it to work. Also, the default open source radeon driver is fully capable these days
2011-03-22T09:21:00.000Z	medfly	soreau	the driver worked previously. I think ubuntu asked me to upgrade the kernel, and that somehow had trouble in the middle.
2011-03-22T09:21:00.000Z	soreau	medfly	There's always trouble with proprietary drivers
2011-03-22T09:22:00.000Z	medfly	soreau	I see, OK.
2011-03-22T09:22:00.000Z	soreau	medfly	If you'd like to use latest radeon drivers, install xorg-edgers repo
2011-03-22T09:22:00.000Z	medfly	soreau	well, it's all right now, I'll worry about getting it again later :)
2011-03-22T09:22:00.000Z	soreau	medfly	Yea, you're using the open driver now
2011-03-22T09:23:00.000Z	medfly	soreau	with how much I upgraded, it'd probably be faster than I'm used to anyway
