2007-01-02T13:22:00.000Z	Zyphern		ohh okay
2007-01-02T13:23:00.000Z	Zyphern		unfortunately its not
2007-01-02T13:24:00.000Z	Zyphern		I am using an SMC Barricade. Whenever I boot Ubuntu every computer in my house loses it's internet connectivity, however I can still connect to my router (192.168.2.1) (see: http://home.cogeco.ca/~justin.vanderheide/status.png). I have the networking set to DHCP yet I still have no internet.
2007-01-02T13:25:00.000Z	Zyphern		I was told I need to get DHCPCD or another DHCP Client daemon, then I was also told that DHCP3 Client came with Ubuntu and to run "sudo dhclient eth0"
2007-01-02T13:25:00.000Z	Zyphern		So I'm not sure what I should do
2007-01-02T13:26:00.000Z	Zyphern		Someone suggested that ubuntu was trying to act as the DHCP Server
2007-01-02T13:26:00.000Z	mnoir	Zyphern	how does it get it's net address?
2007-01-02T13:27:00.000Z	mnoir	Zyphern	is it configured correctly to do that?
2007-01-02T13:28:00.000Z	mnoir	Zyphern	get it's address through the router
2007-01-02T13:29:00.000Z	mnoir	Zyphern	that is unlikely to be your issue
2007-01-02T13:30:00.000Z	mnoir	Zyphern	could you diagram your local network?
2007-01-02T13:31:00.000Z	mnoir	Zyphern	describe how all of your machines connect to the internet
2007-01-02T13:32:00.000Z	mnoir	Zyphern	ok

2007-01-02T13:32:00.000Z	mnoir	Zyphern	is the barricade enabled for dhcp?
2007-01-02T13:33:00.000Z	Zyphern	mnoir	it indicates it is here: http://home.cogeco.ca/~justin.vanderheide/status.PNG
2007-01-02T13:34:00.000Z	mnoir	Zyphern	that is the display from barricade?
2007-01-02T13:34:00.000Z	Zyphern	mnoir	that is the status screen
2007-01-02T13:34:00.000Z	mnoir	Zyphern	is dhcpd running on your ubuntu now?
2007-01-02T13:36:00.000Z	mnoir	Zyphern	i am giving up - you cannot listen to two ppl at the same time
2007-01-02T13:36:00.000Z	Zyphern	mnoir	okay, thanks for your help though mnoir
