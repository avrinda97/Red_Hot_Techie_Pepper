2006-03-09T13:02:00.000Z	bintoxi		hello ther
2006-03-09T13:03:00.000Z	bintoxi		iwonder if someone have managed to enable wlan for acer ferarri 3400
2006-03-09T13:04:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	that one has a Broadcom chipset, hasn't it?
2006-03-09T13:04:00.000Z	bintoxi	soundray	right
2006-03-09T13:05:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	it isn't supported at present, but I heard that dapper will have support, at least for some Broadcom chips.
2006-03-09T13:07:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	here's a guy who made it work with ndiswrapper and 64bit Windows drivers: http://linux.sitetree.nl/pub/acer-ferrari-3400.html
2006-03-09T13:08:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	Gentoo wiki also reports ndiswrapper as working on your laptop model.
2006-03-09T13:08:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	no, you should run ndiswrapper ;)
2006-03-09T13:09:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	but you should upgrade to breezy (5.10) first.
2006-03-09T13:10:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	I see. When you do the install, make sure you get a version 5.10 install CD.
2006-03-09T13:11:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	yes, once you've enabled the repositories through the package manager.
2006-03-09T13:11:00.000Z	bintoxi	soundray	ok then i haveat isoto download the
2006-03-09T13:12:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	so, ndiswrapper-utils is the package you need. You'll find instructions on the wiki.
2006-03-09T13:12:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	what about 64 bit drivers?
2006-03-09T13:13:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	yes. You will find instructions on the Ubuntu wiki.
2006-03-09T13:14:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	yes it could be a lot easier
2006-03-09T13:14:00.000Z	bintoxi	soundray	i wish it was like portage
2006-03-09T13:15:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	if WLAN wasn't encumbered with so many laws and regulations.
2006-03-09T13:15:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	the manufacturer Broadcom has been particularly difficult to work with for open source driver developers.
2006-03-09T13:15:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	internationally.
2006-03-09T13:16:00.000Z	soundray	bintoxi	haven't quite got the hang of typing around the touchpad? ;)
2006-03-09T13:17:00.000Z	bintoxi	soundray	no the stuff is bugging
