2011-04-02T08:41:00.000Z	dzeremis		All right, so you're telling me that in this big Ubuntu support channel, nobody is willing to take a probably very simple question and help me solve my problem? I mean, this is like, easy, but I don't know what to do.
2011-04-02T08:42:00.000Z	scottj	dzeremis	this is a ubuntu channel not a j-pilot chan
2011-04-02T08:42:00.000Z	dzeremis	scottj	I didn't know where else to go. Pardon me.
2011-04-02T08:43:00.000Z	scottj	dzeremis	it's fine to ask here just realize 99% of the people here don't use that app
2011-04-02T08:44:00.000Z	scottj	dzeremis	links are fine
2011-04-02T08:46:00.000Z	scottj	dzeremis	did you compile jpilot or install out of apt/synaptic?
2011-04-02T08:47:00.000Z	dzeremis	scottj	I have no idea. In fact, I'm not even sure how I got the thing on my system? I'm new to Linux and I may have had trouble installing it.
2011-04-02T08:47:00.000Z	scottj	dzeremis	are you already running jpilot?
2011-04-02T08:48:00.000Z	dzeremis	scottj	Yes, I got that far, somehow.
2011-04-02T08:48:00.000Z	scottj	dzeremis	you must know. did you follow those install instructions, was it already on your computer, or did you install it through software updates/synaptic in ubuntu?
2011-04-02T08:49:00.000Z	dzeremis	scottj	I remember having trouble with it and don't remember as clearly as you think. I think I followed install instructions. But hang on a moment and I'll jog my memory.
2011-04-02T08:49:00.000Z	scottj	dzeremis	ok whatever, you can install pilot-link with apt/synaptic. in term sudo apt-get install pilot-link
2011-04-02T08:49:00.000Z	scottj	dzeremis	jpilot doesn't need to be compiled, it's in apt too
2011-04-02T08:50:00.000Z	scottj	dzeremis	into the terminal, that's not a kernel
2011-04-02T08:50:00.000Z	scottj	dzeremis	btw in the system menu, not sure where, there's like a install software link you can click and then install software like jpilot and pilot-link through that
2011-04-02T08:54:00.000Z	dzeremis	scottj	still there?
2011-04-02T08:55:00.000Z	scottj	dzeremis	yeah I have no clue I'm not going to install the software or read it's instructions
2011-04-02T08:56:00.000Z	dzeremis	scottj	I wouldn't ask you to. At this point, I simply want to know if there's an easy way to figure out how to run a program: pilot-link. I'm not sure where in my computer it's stored.
2011-04-02T08:56:00.000Z	scottj	dzeremis	in terminal run man pilot-link
2011-04-02T08:57:00.000Z	dzeremis	scottj	It can't find it.
2011-04-02T08:57:00.000Z	scottj	dzeremis	just man pilot-link
2011-04-02T08:59:00.000Z	dzeremis	scottj	and others: Okay, that was as helpful as it gets for this topic tonight. Thank you all.
