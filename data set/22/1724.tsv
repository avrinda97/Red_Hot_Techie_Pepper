2010-02-16T05:13:00.000Z	direpenguin		cause last time when i tired to just install linux on my main HDD area my computer crashed
2010-02-16T05:13:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	error message?
2010-02-16T05:14:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	have you run the disk check thingummy when you start the cd ?
2010-02-16T05:16:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	there should have been options like; try ubuntu, install ubuntu, check disk?
2010-02-16T05:18:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	you mean dual boot?
2010-02-16T05:18:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	if you install ubuntu after windows, it automatically wants to partition and set up grub for dualboot
2010-02-16T05:19:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	yeah that;s dual boot
2010-02-16T05:20:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	there is a colourful bar when you get to the partitioning part of the installer, there is also a slider on that bar, you can move it around and share the disk space as you wish
2010-02-16T05:21:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	are you talking about when you boot off the livecd; or when you run the program inside windows?
2010-02-16T05:22:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	right, thought so, the defaulting radio button is to install them dual boot, i cant remember the exact wording, but it is something like isntall side by side yes. that is the option it seems you want to choose
2010-02-16T05:24:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	ive only ever used Roxio, after that i used brasero becuase i didnt have windows left
2010-02-16T05:25:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	no
2010-02-16T05:25:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	possibly, it came preinstalled on my computer so i dont know
2010-02-16T05:27:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	actually, i was wrong, i used isorecorder as well once, that worked well enough
2010-02-16T05:28:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	tell you if the disk has an error on it, if it does it might not install properly
2010-02-16T05:30:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	i think so, just choose the iso, choose the drive and burn
2010-02-16T05:36:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	what version you installnig?
2010-02-16T05:37:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	windows
2010-02-16T05:37:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	prepare for a long night :P
2010-02-16T05:40:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	its a good idea, but not as important as on windows, you dont want to go passing anything on
2010-02-16T05:44:00.000Z	PsychoMari0	direpenguin	theoretically yes, but it will murder your performance
