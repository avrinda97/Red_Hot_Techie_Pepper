2006-11-23T10:57:00.000Z	syntaxx	dabaR	i added beryl-manager in the session as the guides told me to do.. now when i logout and log back in my X freeze
2006-11-23T10:58:00.000Z	dabaR	syntaxx	show me the guides, please

2006-11-23T10:59:00.000Z	dabaR	syntaxx	log in failsafe and remove that from your session
2006-11-23T10:59:00.000Z	syntaxx	dabaR	i havent tried wait
2006-11-23T11:00:00.000Z	syntaxx	dabaR	i cant login in failsafe dnome too
2006-11-23T11:01:00.000Z	dabaR	syntaxx	try gnome-session-remove in a console
2006-11-23T11:01:00.000Z	syntaxx	dabaR	ok
2006-11-23T11:02:00.000Z	syntaxx	dabaR	it says cannot open display
2006-11-23T11:07:00.000Z	dabaR	syntaxx	I can only think of logging into X with a different session, then running the gnome-session-properties from the terminal
2006-11-23T11:07:00.000Z	dabaR	syntaxx	actually, that will not work.
2006-11-23T11:07:00.000Z	syntaxx	dabaR	hmm ok
2006-11-23T11:07:00.000Z	syntaxx	dabaR	=/
2006-11-23T11:08:00.000Z	dabaR	syntaxx	since the session will not be running.
2006-11-23T11:08:00.000Z	dabaR	syntaxx	but maybe you could then try the gnome-session-remove, try a different session, do you have any other wms insatlled?
2006-11-23T11:08:00.000Z	syntaxx	dabaR	none
2006-11-23T11:08:00.000Z	dabaR	syntaxx	install openbox, if you want, quickly, it has just 2 packages
2006-11-23T11:09:00.000Z	syntaxx	dabaR	ok
2006-11-23T11:09:00.000Z	dabaR	syntaxx	well, I just tried that too, and it does not work.
2006-11-23T11:12:00.000Z	dabaR	syntaxx	not sure where to remove it, I looked at all the files that are installed by the gnome-session package.
