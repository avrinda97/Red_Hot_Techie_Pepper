2005-05-03T13:10:00.000Z	karl	b2s	wiki for what?
2005-05-03T13:10:00.000Z	karl		clamav, or the wireless?
2005-05-03T13:10:00.000Z	b2s	karl	for amd64 ndiswrapper
2005-05-03T13:11:00.000Z	karl		yeah, it's been fun.
2005-05-03T13:11:00.000Z	karl		I can make ndiswrapper 1.1 and use it with my existing kernel
2005-05-03T13:11:00.000Z	karl		but I've not been able to make a new kernel with ndis1.1
2005-05-03T13:11:00.000Z	karl		not enoguh patch kungfu
2005-05-03T13:12:00.000Z	b2s	karl	patch kungfu?  I hadn't realized it would be difficult to upgrade
2005-05-03T13:13:00.000Z	karl	b2s	the ubuntu linux packages only have ndiswrapper 1.02 support in the tree
2005-05-03T13:13:00.000Z	karl		I guess I just wasn't l33t enough to make it all work.
2005-05-03T13:13:00.000Z	karl		I used up all my patch kungfu getting a delkin cardbus cf adaptor to work.
2005-05-03T13:14:00.000Z	b2s	karl	yeah, ndiswrapper 0.12 didn't work for me at all.  but compiling the new version didn't require anything complicated.  are you sure you had the packages you needed (like linux-headers)?
2005-05-03T13:14:00.000Z	karl	b2s	I could compile the new version
2005-05-03T13:14:00.000Z	karl		that was fine ;)
2005-05-03T13:14:00.000Z	karl		that's how I got it to work.
2005-05-03T13:14:00.000Z	b2s		ah
2005-05-03T13:14:00.000Z	karl		but I needed a custom kernel for a different device
2005-05-03T13:14:00.000Z	karl		and Icouldn't get that kernel, and ndis1.1 at the same time
2005-05-03T13:15:00.000Z	b2s	karl	the custom kernel was based on the ubuntu, or it was vanilla?
2005-05-03T13:15:00.000Z	karl		on ubuntu
2005-05-03T13:15:00.000Z	b2s	karl	hmm, I can't see why that would have failed, but what do I know about ubuntu kernels? :)
2005-05-03T13:16:00.000Z	karl	b2s	me either!
