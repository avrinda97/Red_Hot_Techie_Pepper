2008-12-09T01:49:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK		Hi guys.. Am I paranoid or do my root pass keep changing? I had a linux pro to reset my pass (forgot the old one I thought at first) but now my new pass isnt right too.. two days ago... so Im sure then I havent forgotten the pass(well kinda sure)
2008-12-09T01:49:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK		also.. if I just forgot the pass.. is there a way to reset it easy? without formating?
2008-12-09T01:50:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GaMbi_DK	we dont have a root passoword usually, we use sudo
2008-12-09T01:50:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	zsquareplusc	thats the one :P
2008-12-09T01:50:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GaMbi_DK	with sudo you use your own password
2008-12-09T01:50:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	zsquareplusc	yea.. and it is this pass iw forgot
2008-12-09T01:51:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GaMbi_DK	reboot to recovery mode and use "passwd <username>" in the root shell you get then
2008-12-09T01:52:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	zsquareplusc	"passwd gambi" I will see an encrypted line (guessing it is the pass)
2008-12-09T01:53:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	zsquareplusc	what do I do then? :S
2008-12-09T01:55:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GaMbi_DK	you have a root shell on that box where you dont know the password?
2008-12-09T01:56:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GaMbi_DK	passwd prints a message, but it should not output anything cryptic
2008-12-09T01:56:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	zsquareplusc	no.. just remember from early tries..
2008-12-09T01:57:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	zsquareplusc	so go to "recovery mode"  and do "passwd [user]" and what should happen? it should print my pass? :O
2008-12-09T01:57:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GaMbi_DK	no, ask you for a new one.
2008-12-09T01:59:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	zsquareplusc	got it.. I see where I did my mistake.. thx allot m8
2008-12-09T02:06:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	zsquareplusc	Done :P man that was easy.. I think one of my friends is trying to slap me around.. He was kinda mad becaurse  I put pass so he couldn't install programs and such.. maybe he figgured this trick out too... Is there a way to block root shell? I dont want him to be able to change my pass in 2 min
2008-12-09T02:07:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GaMbi_DK	you could remove or password protect the recovery point. however then you might need a live cd to do recovery which is more complex. and with a live cd, you can get at the passwords anyway
2008-12-09T02:08:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GaMbi_DK	encrpyted partitions are the only weapon against that :/
2008-12-09T02:08:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	zsquareplusc	yea but I bet he dosnt know.. and even if he dose he dosnt have access to a live CD
2008-12-09T02:10:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	zsquareplusc	Do I remove the "recovery mode" or just the "root shell"?
2008-12-09T02:11:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GaMbi_DK	the root shell only. but the better way would be password protect that entry. i think grub can do that
2008-12-09T02:16:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	zsquareplusc	got it.. I got allot of stuff to work with here :) thx alot for the help m8! cya around
