2012-07-19T22:15:00.000Z	emuhelp		??? I want qemu, an emulator, to run my PC in emulation mode, that is, it would start executing the BIOS ROM just as if my PC had just come out of reset -it would read reset vector, and so forth.
2012-07-19T22:16:00.000Z	emuhelp		I tried Virtual Box and BOCHS and couldn't get either to work at all.
2012-07-19T22:18:00.000Z	emuhelp		Simply trying to run qemu on my machine -which is booted with a live Ubuntu 10.04.4 CD which is how I am speaking to you now (via Empathy). I want to run qemu in a terminal window.
2012-07-19T22:18:00.000Z	emuhelp		Can't emulate my PC???
2012-07-19T22:19:00.000Z	emuhelp		No, I can't run qemu -but it at least works a lot closer (compile, etc works).
2012-07-19T22:21:00.000Z	emuhelp		The ACTUAL problem I'm trying to solve is to install Ubuntu on this computer, and to do that I have to debug GRUB2, and to do that I figure I have to run my PC in virtualization and use GDB to debug it.
2012-07-19T22:22:00.000Z	emuhelp		Perhaps I have to copy my ROM image into a file so it is used instead of SeaBIOS ?
2012-07-19T22:22:00.000Z	beandog	emuhelp	what the crap .. why do you need to debug grub?
2012-07-19T22:22:00.000Z	beandog		just use a different bootloader
2012-07-19T22:23:00.000Z	emuhelp		When I've tried installing Ubuntu, I get "error: file not found. grub rescue>" and can't get beyond that. Been working on this problem for MONTHS...
2012-07-19T22:24:00.000Z	beandog		my vote is use syslinux.  It's less dumb.
2012-07-19T22:24:00.000Z	emuhelp		Perhaps I am confused about emulation... everything... anyway, like I said, been working at this for months... 1000 hours at least.
2012-07-19T22:24:00.000Z	beandog		Not to mention WAY less complex ... you can have a setup in under 10 lines
2012-07-19T22:25:00.000Z	emuhelp		I have not tried other Linux, only Ubuntu 10.04
2012-07-19T22:25:00.000Z	emuhelp		Which works on live CD just fine, but can't get it on hard drive. One hard drive.
2012-07-19T22:26:00.000Z	emuhelp		Computer is HP Pavilion desktop, not sure exact model, but 2.2GHz anyway, 500GB HD
2012-07-19T22:27:00.000Z	emuhelp		Yes, computer ran Windows fine -certain it is not hardware problem.
2012-07-19T22:27:00.000Z	emuhelp		Ran Windows Vista
2012-07-19T22:28:00.000Z	emuhelp		No 'out of disk' error. My research says Grub2 doesn't have that problem since it bypasses the BIOS totally -that was only GRUB legacy.
2012-07-19T22:28:00.000Z	beandog	emuhelp	dude, you are making this WAY too comples
2012-07-19T22:28:00.000Z	beandog		*complex
2012-07-19T22:29:00.000Z	emuhelp	beandog	Perhaps, but I just don't know any other way. :(
