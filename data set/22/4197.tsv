2008-12-26T11:20:00.000Z	moses		its much to heavy

2008-12-26T11:21:00.000Z	jim_p	moses	no, they are equal
2008-12-26T11:21:00.000Z	jim_p	moses	how much ram are you on?
2008-12-26T11:23:00.000Z	jim_p	moses	please explain me why do you want the live enviroment to load to ram first?
2008-12-26T11:24:00.000Z	jim_p	moses	how much ram is on that pc you are on?
2008-12-26T11:25:00.000Z	jim_p	moses	cat /proc/meminfo | grep MemTotal
2008-12-26T11:27:00.000Z	jim_p	moses	what did that command return?
2008-12-26T11:34:00.000Z	jim_p	moses	cat /proc/meminfo | grep MemTotal
2008-12-26T11:35:00.000Z	jim_p	moses	if you dont know how much memory you have, telling you what to use is pointless
2008-12-26T11:44:00.000Z	moses	jim_p	192mb of ram
2008-12-26T11:45:00.000Z	jim_p	moses	get xubuntu cd or some other xfce based distro. you can always use a *box based distro but you have to be really adept with configuration files
2008-12-26T11:46:00.000Z	jim_p	moses	yea. or part of it
2008-12-26T11:54:00.000Z	jim_p	moses	k3b
