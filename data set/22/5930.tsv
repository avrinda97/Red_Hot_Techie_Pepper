2008-11-10T17:42:00.000Z	badstue		What is the best partition setting for a normal ubuntu workstation ? Any new guides for that ?
2008-11-10T17:43:00.000Z	badstue		like how much the /usr, /var, /boot and so on should have
2008-11-10T17:43:00.000Z	Pici	badstue	How much storage do you have to work with total?
2008-11-10T17:44:00.000Z	Pici	badstue	10gb for / the rest for /home  Size differently if you plan on hosting web pages out of /var of course.
2008-11-10T17:45:00.000Z	badstue	Pici	so i should only have 2 partitions ?
2008-11-10T17:46:00.000Z	Pici	badstue	For a desktop system, thats all thats really needed.
2008-11-10T17:46:00.000Z	badstue	Pici	okay.. and thats a optimal setting ?
2008-11-10T17:46:00.000Z	badstue	Pici	okay.. i'll try it out
2008-11-10T17:46:00.000Z	Pici	badstue	Take a 1.5x ram out for swap, or if you have a large amount of ram, do equal to ram.
2008-11-10T17:48:00.000Z	badstue	Pici	yup.. So to sum up.. I just need 2 partitions under the installer and a swap ? dont i need to add the other like /usr /var and so on ? or will they be automatically added ?
2008-11-10T17:48:00.000Z	Pici	badstue	Anything that falls under / (root) will be part of that partition unless you specify, as you are for /home
2008-11-10T17:48:00.000Z	badstue	Pici	thank you :) i'll do it right away
2008-11-10T18:16:00.000Z	badstue	Pici	Is it important how the primary and logical settings are set ? Like should i set the / as primary and the rest as logical ?
2008-11-10T18:16:00.000Z	Pici	badstue	I've never changed those settings on my installs, but I think it would make sense to at least make / primary.
2008-11-10T18:18:00.000Z	badstue	Pici	Dr_Willis: okay.. well. I'll try again. Last install returned me a CD-read error.. zzz
2008-11-10T18:19:00.000Z	badstue	Pici	Btw, what will the root password be ?
2008-11-10T18:20:00.000Z	badstue	Pici	hmm.. so there is no root password. But isnt that unsafe ?
2008-11-10T18:21:00.000Z	Pici	badstue	The root account password is locked, there is nothing that you could supply to the password prompt that would let you login as it.
2008-11-10T18:21:00.000Z	badstue	Pici	how ? So if i want to make a change that needs root access.. i just use the sudo cmd ?
2008-11-10T18:21:00.000Z	Pici	badstue	Take a look at the url that ubottu posted for more info.
2008-11-10T18:21:00.000Z	badstue	Pici	yup.. i will
2008-11-10T18:21:00.000Z	badstue	Pici	thank you once again :)
