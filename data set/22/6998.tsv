2006-06-28T16:17:00.000Z	jimcooncat		hi, adding a ~/bin directory doesn't include it in my $PATH? It looks like it would according to .bash_profile.
2006-06-28T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	jimcooncat	~/.bash_profile probably does not get sourced when you log into gnome.  It only gets sourced for login shells.  You can use ~/.gnomerc
2006-06-28T16:20:00.000Z	jrib	jimcooncat	probably not, I don't know what file to use then would be
2006-06-28T16:21:00.000Z	jrib	jimcooncat	you could try ~/.xfcerc but you just need it to get sourced somewhere.  You could put it in ~/.bashrc, then it will get added to your path everytime you start a shell
2006-06-28T16:22:00.000Z	jrib	jimcooncat	just means something reads it and does what it says
2006-06-28T16:23:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jrib	I think I understand, to make sure it gets executed.
2006-06-28T16:23:00.000Z	jrib	jimcooncat	exactly
2006-06-28T16:25:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jrib	I got it, there's postlogin scripts available in gdm, thanks
2006-06-28T16:25:00.000Z	jrib	jimcooncat	cool np
2007-01-07T08:38:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jrib	hey, htop's nice, thanks!
2007-09-17T08:01:00.000Z	jrib	jimcooncat	a while loop
2007-09-17T08:01:00.000Z	jrib	jimcooncat	http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_09_02.html
2007-09-17T08:02:00.000Z	jrib	jimcooncat	I'd recommend putting a 'sleep' in the loop so you wait a little between tries
2007-09-17T08:06:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jrib	" while true; do sleep 60 & ssh 10.0.0.200; done" seems to be working fine. thanks a lot
2007-09-17T08:06:00.000Z	jrib	jimcooncat	hmm, && instead of & maybe?
2007-09-17T08:09:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jrib	oops! && it is
2008-09-09T00:30:00.000Z	jrib	jimcooncat	you might want to try #ubuntu-motu
2008-12-15T23:06:00.000Z	jrib	jimcooncat	ah, yeah, do: /msg ubottu !source
2011-03-02T18:25:00.000Z	jrib	jimcooncat	where are you installing acroread from?
2011-03-02T18:25:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jrib	partner repo
2011-03-02T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	jimcooncat	have you run « sudo apt-get update » and tried again?
2011-03-02T18:28:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jrib	thank you, I had forgot to update
