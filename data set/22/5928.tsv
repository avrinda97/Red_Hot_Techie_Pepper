2008-01-12T04:57:00.000Z	sp0ro		Apparently my login screen has a different resolution(1900x1080) than my desktop resolution(1280x1024). Is there anyway to fix my login window to show a resolution of 1280x1024? It used to be 1280x1024, but randomly changed. I did not play with any configurations before this started happening.
2008-01-12T04:58:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro	check /etc/X11/xorg.conf , there should be a Modes line near the end. Set that to the res you want
2008-01-12T05:00:00.000Z	sp0ro	nickrud	gnoift, ty checking now.
2008-01-12T05:02:00.000Z	sp0ro	nickrud	gnoift: hm, that is a first. My xorg.conf has *NO* resolutions listed whatsoever. I can pastebin the xorg.conf if you don't believe me. :P
2008-01-12T05:02:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro	yeah, that's common now, X is getting smarter.
2008-01-12T05:05:00.000Z	sp0ro	nickrud	gnoift: Going to try uninstalling and reinstalling the restricted ATI drivers for my card and see if that works. brb
2008-01-12T07:09:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro	I don't believe the ubuntu fglrx supports that card, apt-cache show xorg-driver-fglrx lists the chipsets it does support
2008-01-12T07:10:00.000Z	sp0ro	nickrud	Yes the restricted drivers work, they were working perfectly before I had to reinstall ubuntu 7.10 on a new hdd
2008-01-13T09:12:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro	your window decorator/manager crashed, are you using compiz
2008-01-13T09:13:00.000Z	sp0ro	nickrud	I am using default GNOME at the moment. Like I said earlier, the only thing I changed was the GDM login screen. Now everything related to the GNOME interface is bugged.
2008-01-13T09:24:00.000Z	sp0ro	nickrud	alt+f2 is not bringing up the run window. :(
2008-01-13T09:24:00.000Z	sp0ro	nickrud	Checked if gnome-panel was not running, but it is.
2008-01-13T09:24:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro	you don't see anything on your screen except the background I bet
2008-01-13T09:25:00.000Z	sp0ro	nickrud	I can see this xchat and the panels fine, nothing works on the panels except the top panel though. :P
2008-01-13T09:25:00.000Z	sp0ro	nickrud	Even then, the functions on the top panel are running extremely slow or not at all
2008-01-13T09:25:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro	bad bet then. try killall gnome-panel
2008-01-13T09:25:00.000Z	sp0ro	nickrud	kk
2008-01-13T09:27:00.000Z	sp0ro	nickrud	Hm, even killall gnome-panel isn't making the panels go away heh. It acts like it's closing them, then they reappear. :|
2008-01-13T09:28:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro	they should return, that's a good sign actually.  In system->prefs->sessions, second tab, you can see the gnome aware apps that are running. If you selected gnome-panel there, you'd see that it was categorized as restart (dropdown just below the text window)
2008-01-13T09:30:00.000Z	sp0ro	nickrud	Still no metacity and alt+f2 isn't allowing me to open the run window still.
2008-01-13T09:31:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro	try this test.  log out, ctl-alt-f1 , hit enter, and log in. do ps -A . If you see any gnome apps, killall them. also killall gconfd-2 , and bonobo-activation if you see them. Then ctl-alt-f7 and log back in.
2008-01-13T09:31:00.000Z	sp0ro	nickrud	I mean, I can run metacity from the terminal and it works, but there is an underlying problem somewhere. :x
