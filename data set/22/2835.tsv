2009-02-17T03:28:00.000Z	titan_ark_		btw i am on xubuntu 8.10
2009-02-17T03:28:00.000Z	iaindalton	titan_ark_	Does the Ubuntu Manual not have a section on that?
2009-02-17T03:29:00.000Z	iaindalton	titan_ark_	System menu > Help and Support > Advanced Topics > Using the Command Line.
2009-02-17T03:30:00.000Z	iaindalton	titan_ark_	It looks pretty poor, though.  The Ubuntu ppl should take a page (literally) out of Mandriva's book!
2009-02-17T03:33:00.000Z	titan_ark_	iaindalton	I dont see Help and Support in the menu! I am on xubuntu 8.10
2009-02-17T03:33:00.000Z	iaindalton	titan_ark_	Just launch `Yelp'.
2009-02-17T03:34:00.000Z	titan_ark_	iaindalton	from command line? sorry but I have to ask you how to do it. I am a no brainer in this!!! I have just gotten started on linux!
2009-02-17T03:35:00.000Z	iaindalton	titan_ark_	I don't know the interface of XFCE, but there should be a `Run command' item in some menu.
2009-02-17T03:36:00.000Z	titan_ark_	iaindalton	well i get to the terminal but how do i run the application there?
2009-02-17T03:37:00.000Z	iaindalton	titan_ark_	type `yelp' then Enter, but there really should be a `help' menu item, perhaps under `Applications'
2009-02-17T03:40:00.000Z	titan_ark_	iaindalton	yes it invokes the Ubuntu help Center
2009-02-17T03:40:00.000Z	iaindalton	titan_ark_	OK, now Advanced Topics > Command Line
2009-02-17T03:42:00.000Z	titan_ark_	iaindalton	No, there aint no advanced topics there
2009-02-17T03:42:00.000Z	iaindalton	titan_ark_	The bottom of the left sidebar?
2009-02-17T03:43:00.000Z	titan_ark_	iaindalton	it has no side bar. just some basic info on the page. i did a search for advaned topics and it threw up nothing
2009-02-17T03:44:00.000Z	iaindalton	titan_ark_	 Anyway, I have it up, and it looks pretty pathetic compared to what I remember Mandrake's manual being.  Check out the Mandriva manual's section on the command line, most of it should apply to Ubuntu: http://doc.mandrivalinux.com/MandrakeLinux/101/en/Command-Line.html/
2009-02-17T03:45:00.000Z	titan_ark_	iaindalton	okay i shall bookmark that! thanks a million!
2009-02-17T03:46:00.000Z	iaindalton	titan_ark_	so your help center doesn't look like http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_D1EpnOVJuA8/SPhOv6kdP3I/AAAAAAAABX4/vFWpxLMG-ak/s400/help.png ?
2009-02-17T03:48:00.000Z	titan_ark_	iaindalton	Well the page looks the same but the Links under "Topics" on the left does not exist
2009-02-17T03:49:00.000Z	iaindalton	titan_ark_	I guess that makes sense.  A lot of the manual is GNOME-specific, and wouldn't apply to Xubuntu.
2009-02-17T03:50:00.000Z	titan_ark_	iaindalton	oh okay! I am running a box low on resources. So had to install xubuntu after ubuntu live and alternate refused to install!
2009-02-17T03:54:00.000Z	iaindalton	titan_ark_	Ubuntu exists under the illusion that users will never need to use the command line.  Unfortunately, that is still untrue in many cases.
