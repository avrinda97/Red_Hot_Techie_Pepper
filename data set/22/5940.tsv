2007-01-17T12:41:00.000Z	Flannel	AgentChemical	did you burn at 4x?
2007-01-17T12:43:00.000Z	Flannel	AgentChemical	so, it doesn't boot at all?  is your BIOS setup correctly?
2007-01-17T12:43:00.000Z	Flannel	AgentChemical	and, if you browse the CD, what do you see on it?
2007-01-17T12:44:00.000Z	Flannel	AgentChemical	hmm.  that is very odd indeed.
2007-01-17T12:44:00.000Z	Flannel	AgentChemical	try the 6.06 CD
2007-01-17T12:44:00.000Z	Flannel	AgentChemical	see if it's jsut a fluke of the ISO, or... what.
2007-01-17T12:46:00.000Z	Flannel	AgentChemical	actually, you can check yourself.  Let me get you a manifest
2007-01-17T12:47:00.000Z	AgentChemical	Flannel	yah thanks

2007-01-17T12:55:00.000Z	AgentChemical	Flannel	it checks out
2007-01-17T13:19:00.000Z	Flannel	AgentChemical	I'd try download a 6.06 server ISO, and trying that.
2007-01-17T13:19:00.000Z	Flannel	AgentChemical	ah, good.
