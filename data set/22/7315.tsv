2006-05-12T08:59:00.000Z	muraii__1		Okay, let's try another one.  I have largely eschewed Gnome for Openbox 3 only; but I want to add to my menu stuff like firestarter or ethereal, that require sudo.
2006-05-12T08:59:00.000Z	muraii__1		What can I do to make the password dialog box pop up, so I don't have to always have a terminal tethered to a process/application running?
2006-05-12T09:00:00.000Z	mustard5	muraii__1	oh...I saw this yesterday :)
2006-05-12T09:01:00.000Z	mustard5	muraii__1	it was something like 'detach' or something..can't remember
2006-05-12T09:01:00.000Z	muraii__1	mustard5	Hmmm...
2006-05-12T09:02:00.000Z	mustard5	muraii__1	what app are you running?
2006-05-12T09:03:00.000Z	muraii__1	mustard5	firestarter and ethereal require it.
2006-05-12T09:03:00.000Z	mustard5	muraii__1	try running with gksudo?
2006-05-12T09:04:00.000Z	muraii__1	mustard5	Aha!  That might actually be it!
2006-05-12T09:04:00.000Z	mustard5	muraii__1	the syntax for the thing was something like   <command you want to use> & detach
2006-05-12T09:05:00.000Z	mustard5	muraii__1	but it might not be 'detach'...I'm obsessed now..I have to find it :)
2006-05-12T09:05:00.000Z	mustard5	muraii__1	ah it is 'detach' :)
2006-05-12T09:06:00.000Z	muraii__1	mustard5	gksudo is precisely what I want.
2006-05-12T09:06:00.000Z	mustard5	muraii__1	well thats the main thing :D
2006-05-12T09:07:00.000Z	muraii__1	mustard5	But now the detach thing is interesting.  I can open a terminal, type "sudo firestarter & detach", type password, and all is good?
2006-05-12T09:07:00.000Z	mustard5	muraii__1	I think so :)
2006-05-12T09:09:00.000Z	mustard5	muraii__1	I think strictly speaking gtk apps are supposed to be run with gksudo
2006-05-12T09:10:00.000Z	mustard5	muraii__1	the ones that need to be run as a superuser that is
2006-05-12T09:10:00.000Z	muraii__1	mustard5	Makes sense.
2006-05-12T09:23:00.000Z	muraii__1	mustard5	Tried the "sudo <command> & detach" at the command line, but no go.  It's no big deal, but now I'm curious.  Do you have "screen" installed by chance?  I know it lets you detach processes.
2006-05-12T09:23:00.000Z	mustard5	muraii__1	yeah...its installed but I don't know how to use it
2006-05-12T09:24:00.000Z	muraii__1	mustard5	I think that's a screen-specific command.
