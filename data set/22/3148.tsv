2009-03-02T06:49:00.000Z	huwenfeng	crdlb	GMA 4500
2009-03-02T06:49:00.000Z	crdlb	huwenfeng	you want them to show the same thing or not?
2009-03-02T06:50:00.000Z	huwenfeng	crdlb	not the same thing,  i want one to show , for example, firefox, the other show the x-terminal or play movies
2009-03-02T06:50:00.000Z	crdlb	huwenfeng	have you looked in Screen Resolution and made sure Mirror Screens isn't enabled?
2009-03-02T06:52:00.000Z	huwenfeng	crdlb	what ? my resolution is 1280 800, and in the Screen Resolution, i have not see "Mirror screen" , i saw "Clone Screens" . Is that what you mean?
2009-03-02T06:52:00.000Z	crdlb	huwenfeng	yes, it says mirror here, but that might be a change in jaunty
2009-03-02T06:54:00.000Z	huwenfeng	crdlb	oh, i enabled it , now , they show the same thing!
2009-03-02T06:54:00.000Z	crdlb	huwenfeng	err, what exactly happens when it's not enabled?
2009-03-02T06:55:00.000Z	huwenfeng	crdlb	it does not detect the Screen, the Screen is black.
2009-03-02T06:56:00.000Z	huwenfeng	crdlb	i mean, i did not use the independent screen ever, and now i want to use it to show more things. i mean show different things on the two screen,
2009-03-02T06:58:00.000Z	crdlb	huwenfeng	pastebin the output of 'xrandr'
2009-03-02T07:04:00.000Z	crdlb	huwenfeng	it should be as simple as clicking on both monitors and clicking Enable
2009-03-02T07:06:00.000Z	crdlb	huwenfeng	pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2009-03-02T07:10:00.000Z	crdlb	huwenfeng	wc -l /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-03-02T07:13:00.000Z	huwenfeng	crdlb	http://dpaste.com/4371/
2009-03-02T07:13:00.000Z	crdlb	huwenfeng	that works too :)
2009-03-02T07:13:00.000Z	crdlb	huwenfeng	just a guess, but maybe hardy doesn't fully support the 4500
2009-03-02T07:14:00.000Z	crdlb	huwenfeng	try asking #intel-gfx about the error you got
2009-03-02T07:16:00.000Z	crdlb	huwenfeng	I mean the "screen cannot be larger than 1280x1280" error, btw
