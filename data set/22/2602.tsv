2009-04-28T03:06:00.000Z	supersasho		Hi.. Youtube doesnt work on Firefox, but on Opera it does.. (it says i should update my flash player)
2009-04-28T03:07:00.000Z	Gadu1	supersasho	in the firefox address bar type `plugins` and hit enter
2009-04-28T03:07:00.000Z	Gadu1	supersasho	that has all the downloads you need
2009-04-28T03:08:00.000Z	supersasho	Gadu1	thanks..i'll give it a shot
2009-04-28T03:09:00.000Z	supersasho	Gadu1	yup i see it now
2009-04-28T03:10:00.000Z	supersasho	Gadu1	ok, i dont know how to progress, could you be more specific?
2009-04-28T03:11:00.000Z	Gadu1	supersasho	it lists several plugins "Adobe Flash Player" for example is what you'll need to use youtube. Download that, close firefox, install it, reopen firefox
2009-04-28T03:13:00.000Z	supersasho	Gadu1	but the problem is, i did downloaded it, but that didn't help.. hours ago, i watched some videos and there was no problem.. it just happend after reboot
2009-04-28T03:14:00.000Z	Gadu1	supersasho	ah sorry, the default download isn't correct. there should be a link to alternate version so you can get a deb
2009-04-28T03:15:00.000Z	Gadu1	supersasho	technically the download you got works but you'd have to install it via command line, otherwise just download the deb version
2009-04-28T03:16:00.000Z	supersasho	Gadu1	on the adobe site is even a .deb for ubuntu 8.04+ but when i install it, it says you have allready a newer version installed
2009-04-28T03:17:00.000Z	supersasho	Gadu1	i've checked it in synaptic and the versions are the same, so no update is possible over .deb from adobe site or apt-get
2009-04-28T03:19:00.000Z	Gadu1	supersasho	type adding medibuntu repository and installing ubuntu-restricted-extras and w32codecs?
2009-04-28T03:26:00.000Z	supersasho	Gadu1	no change :(
2009-04-28T03:28:00.000Z	supersasho	Gadu1	could it be a firefox problem, cause in Opera the youtube is fine
2009-04-28T03:32:00.000Z	Gadu1	supersasho	try setting firefox as your default webbrowser and install the deb http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/ again
2009-04-28T03:39:00.000Z	supersasho	Gadu1	ff is set as a default browser and the reinstall of flash plugin didnt helped
2009-04-28T03:45:00.000Z	Gadu1	supersasho	I don't see any reason your firefox shouldn't be working right now. I recommend purging firefox and deleting any leftover hidden mozilla stuff in your home folder. then reinstall firefox and add the flash deb while firefox isn't open
2009-04-28T03:45:00.000Z	Gadu1	supersasho	also, backup your bookmarks O_O
2009-04-28T03:45:00.000Z	supersasho	Gadu1	and passwords!
2009-04-28T03:46:00.000Z	Gadu1	supersasho	that too ^_^
2009-04-28T03:46:00.000Z	supersasho	Gadu1	i'll try that probably, cause i dont see a reason for it not working.. thanks anyway :)
