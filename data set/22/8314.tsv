2005-09-12T06:08:00.000Z	neurondev		hey guys, I have issues setting up a Realtek based Ethernet Card. I need to setup dhcp3-server on it. However I don't think Ubuntu is even detecting the card correctly. Any ideas? Also Firefox doesn't work. Can't load a single webpage. (But I can do IRC, and download package updates!)
2005-09-12T06:10:00.000Z	pauldaoust	neurondev	if you type in 'lspci | grep -i ether' does it mention anything?
2005-09-12T06:10:00.000Z	neurondev	pauldaoust	let me try that
2005-09-12T06:11:00.000Z	neurondev	pauldaoust	yep I get both my cards showing up, 1 is nvidia Ethernet Controller, the other is RTL-8139/8139C card
2005-09-12T06:12:00.000Z	neurondev	pauldaoust	I guess the cards are detected, what confuses me is ifconfig returns eth0,eth1,sit0 what is sit0? I know the Nvidia ethernet card is on eth0.
2005-09-12T06:15:00.000Z	neurondev	pauldaoust	eth0 is also connected to my DSL modem.
2005-09-12T06:15:00.000Z	pauldaoust	neurondev	ha, I wondered about that for a while too. sit0 is a IPv6-over-IPv4 virtual tunnel thingy
2005-09-12T06:15:00.000Z	neurondev	pauldaoust	ok, so the RTL card is eth1?
2005-09-12T06:15:00.000Z	neurondev	pauldaoust	would assume it is.
2005-09-12T06:15:00.000Z	pauldaoust	neurondev	probably.
2005-09-12T06:15:00.000Z	neurondev	pauldaoust	Ok first thing is I tried bringing up dhcpd3 on eth1, and it says 'No subnet declaration for eth1 (0.0.0.0)'
2005-09-12T06:15:00.000Z	neurondev	pauldaoust	... and 'Not configured to listen on any interfaces'. How can I fix that?
2005-09-12T06:16:00.000Z	pauldaoust	neurondev	weird. so network autodetect doesn't work, and that's why you're using dhcpcd?
2005-09-12T06:16:00.000Z	pauldaoust	neurondev	wait. you're using dhcpd or dhcpcd?
2005-09-12T06:17:00.000Z	neurondev	pauldaoust	'dhcpcd' elicits an error.
2005-09-12T06:18:00.000Z	neurondev	pauldaoust	dhcpd3 is a dhcp server thats what I use.
2005-09-12T06:18:00.000Z	pauldaoust	neurondev	'cuz dhcpd3 (the one without the extra 'c') is a DHCP server, for when you want other machines to get their IP addresses from you
2005-09-12T06:19:00.000Z	neurondev	pauldaoust	that is what I want. I have another PC wired to eth1
2005-09-12T06:19:00.000Z	pauldaoust	neurondev	oh, so you're aware of that. sounds like your setup is a lot more complex than I'm used to...
2005-09-12T06:19:00.000Z	neurondev	pauldaoust	I want Ubuntu to hand out IP addresses on eth1. This means I need a dhcp server running on eth1.
2005-09-12T06:20:00.000Z	pauldaoust	neurondev	but I think it's significant that dhcpd3 sez it's not configured to listen on any interfaces. you might want to research that... check out the server's config files... mind you, if you can't even get eth0 up, it's pointless, unless you want a cozy little local network, I guess ;)
2005-09-12T06:21:00.000Z	neurondev	pauldaoust	eth0 is up. I just cant use Firefox. I am using eth0 right now with a dsl modem to chat w/ you guys
