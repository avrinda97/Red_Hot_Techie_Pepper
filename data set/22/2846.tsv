2012-06-28T11:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	tried a different session? like Unity2D?
2012-06-28T11:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	they will always run and are seperate to the desktop
2012-06-28T11:15:00.000Z	yuka	ActionParsnip	however if i login with other username.. i can login but i dont see any toolbar on left or so
2012-06-28T11:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	is your user the owner of all of it's data and do all partitions have more than 10% free space
2012-06-28T11:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	have you checked the ownerships?
2012-06-28T11:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	the services you are naming will run regardless of the desktop situation, they are daemons so it doesn't matter that you cannot login to them, it's not a test of anthing ecept that they get started
2012-06-28T11:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	if you make a fresh ubutu user and login, is the session ok?
2012-06-28T11:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	then its the apps, not your user settings having issue
2012-06-28T11:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	what GPU do you use?
2012-06-28T11:45:00.000Z	yuka	ActionParsnip	, any idea what i could do?
2012-06-28T11:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	no idea, maybe others can advise
2012-06-28T11:49:00.000Z	yuka	ActionParsnip	what if i try to update to 12.04
2012-06-28T12:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	try not hitting ENtER after every 3rd word
2012-06-28T12:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	if it does, just restore settings etc from bsckup
2012-08-23T12:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	have you also asked in #php ?
2012-08-23T12:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	just means you need to be identified and registered
2012-08-23T14:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	do you have the bold version of the font?
2012-08-23T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	I suggest you check it
2012-08-23T14:39:00.000Z	yuka	ActionParsnip	i installed the win7 fonts, refreshed cache right now
2012-08-23T15:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yuka	I suggest you reinstall the bold font after removing it
2012-08-23T15:27:00.000Z	yuka	ActionParsnip	i will reinstall it ok, but i am 100% sure the font is ok as i copied it from linux box to windows desktop and even opened it to see its the right font
