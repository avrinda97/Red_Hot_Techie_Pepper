2010-10-24T17:06:00.000Z	lidbjork		If I wanna use the TV out (svideo) on my Nvidia card, what do I need to do? (ubuntu 10.04.1)
2010-10-24T17:07:00.000Z	lidbjork		I've checked some forum threads, but they're all pretty old (2007-2008)
2010-10-24T17:07:00.000Z	rooks	lidbjork	i think you have to use nvidia control panel that ships with nvidias proprietary driver
2010-10-24T17:08:00.000Z	lidbjork	rooks	Ok.

2010-10-24T17:09:00.000Z	lidbjork	rooks	Oh, that's interesting
2010-10-24T17:10:00.000Z	rooks	lidbjork	yup, i solved some graphics driver issues myself by using ati's control panel :)
2010-10-24T17:11:00.000Z	lidbjork	rooks	Just a basic question -- will I have to install some nvidia drivers before I use this nvidia-settings app, or am I perhaps already using nvidia drivers by default?
2010-10-24T17:11:00.000Z	rooks	lidbjork	since i have ati and not nvidia :)
2010-10-24T17:12:00.000Z	rooks	lidbjork	system → administration → additional drivers / hardware drivers
2010-10-24T17:14:00.000Z	lidbjork	rooks	Yes, I tried that. It says "no proprietary drivers are in use on this system" and then shows a small list of nvidia drivers to install. It doest't, however, show what drivers I AM using at the moment.
2010-10-24T17:14:00.000Z	lidbjork	rooks	But I guess I should go ahead and try to install them.
2010-10-24T17:14:00.000Z	rooks	lidbjork	i thin youre using opensource nvidia drivers by default
2010-10-24T17:15:00.000Z	lidbjork	rooks	Ok, yeah, that would make sense. But I guess I can't use the nvidia-settings panel with the open source drivers.
2010-10-24T17:16:00.000Z	rooks	lidbjork	its only on proprietary drivers, have you btw tried system → preferences → monitors , when you rebooted your computer with tvout cable attached to your computer?
2010-10-24T17:17:00.000Z	lidbjork	rooks	Yes, I've tried that with no luck, no response at all from the tv
2010-10-24T17:18:00.000Z	rooks	lidbjork	hmm. sucks, i guess only way out is to install proprietary drivers and mangle with nvidia control panel
2010-10-24T17:19:00.000Z	lidbjork	rooks	Ok, I'll try.
2010-10-24T17:22:00.000Z	lidbjork	rooks	I was thinking about making a backup of my xorg.conf, but I can't find it anywhere. (Looked in /etc/X11, /etc, and other places)
2010-10-24T17:24:00.000Z	rooks	lidbjork	by default there is no xorg, all is autoconfigured, an i think control pnel will make backups, tho im not sure
2010-10-24T17:27:00.000Z	lidbjork	rooks	Ok
