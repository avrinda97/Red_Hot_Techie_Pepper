2011-06-09T19:45:00.000Z	RA_drc		hi,  how can i set up my ubuntu box so that other machines on my network can ssh to it?
2011-06-09T19:45:00.000Z	ikonia	RA_drc	just install the pacakge openssh-server
2011-06-09T19:51:00.000Z	ikonia	RA_drc	you set that when you installed it
2011-06-09T19:53:00.000Z	RA_drc	ikonia	i wasn't the one who installed it, unfortunately
2011-06-09T19:54:00.000Z	ikonia	RA_drc	then ask the person who did
2011-06-09T19:57:00.000Z	RA_drc	ikonia	the person who installed it doesn't know
2011-07-01T22:38:00.000Z	ikonia	RA_drc	can we stop with the bot commands please ?
2011-07-01T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	RA_drc	please stop now. using ! infront of the word is triggering the bot
2011-08-01T20:12:00.000Z	ikonia	RA_drc	find /foo -name bar -print
2011-08-01T20:17:00.000Z	RA_drc	ikonia	i tried your command, it's not working for me.  would running find -wholename /contrib -name gumstix -print work better?
2011-08-01T20:17:00.000Z	ikonia	RA_drc	no
2011-08-01T20:17:00.000Z	ikonia	RA_drc	I've given you the correct command
2011-08-01T20:17:00.000Z	RA_drc	ikonia	i tried running your command, and it found nothing
2011-08-01T20:17:00.000Z	ikonia	RA_drc	then it's not there
2011-08-01T20:19:00.000Z	RA_drc	ikonia	i tried it on a folder that is very much there, and it didn't show up
2011-08-01T20:19:00.000Z	ikonia	RA_drc	what is the name of the folder
2011-08-01T20:21:00.000Z	RA_drc	ikonia	they are called foo and bar - i made folders to test out the commands.  would it be a problem if the folder called foo wasn't in the same directory as the directory in which i ran the command?
2011-08-01T20:22:00.000Z	ikonia	RA_drc	then you are using it wrong, it works fine
2011-08-01T20:22:00.000Z	ikonia	RA_drc	if foo is in the dir bar, "find bar/ -name foo -print"
2011-08-01T20:27:00.000Z	RA_drc	ikonia	i created a series of folders, so that the structure is like so:  test/foo/bar, and i ran "~$find /foo -name bar -print" and it is not finding those folders
2011-08-04T19:55:00.000Z	RA_drc	ikonia	we are already in #ubuntu, why would you message us
2011-08-04T19:59:00.000Z	RA_drc	ikonia	wow, these spammers are good
