2010-02-23T15:48:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		can someone give me a valid argument as to why there isn't a binary available?
2010-02-23T15:49:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		the original server went offline
2010-02-23T15:49:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		and the IDIOTS are not awake to put it online
2010-02-23T15:49:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		and I already moved the dns
2010-02-23T15:49:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		and the sql file was delted because
2010-02-23T15:49:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		and this is IMPORTANT
2010-02-23T15:50:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		So, HOW IS IT POSSIBLE that when I get this new server they have a root account setup. karmic doesn't install that way does it?
2010-02-23T15:50:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		I didn't even notice, I ran some scripts
2010-02-23T15:50:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		and then was like, ffs, what? I need to setup this, and groups. ok.
2010-02-23T15:51:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		extundelete
2010-02-23T15:51:00.000Z	jpds	uyjhgjhkg	We don't do Mac OSX support.
2010-02-23T15:51:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		and realise I'd copied the sql file also into the ... jpds - yes I am on OSX. thanks for noticing. My server, and the file, are on karmic
2010-02-23T15:52:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg	jpds	and I don't want to hear about you not supporting OSX, if that is the only reason you wanted to talk to me, thanks
2010-02-23T15:52:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		Some people - feel so empowered, see a point in which they can say something negative, and off they go, loaded question in hand, ready to pounce. Internet heros.
2010-02-23T15:52:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		:-)
2010-02-23T15:53:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		I'm ok. Just... every time 1 thing goes wrong I get exposed to 47 things that make me wonder how humanity ever managed to walk upright. :p
2010-02-23T15:54:00.000Z	jpds	uyjhgjhkg	I thought you were trying to install extundelete on the OSX, sorry.
2010-02-23T15:54:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg	jpds	no worries, I needed something else to deal with and explain. I am just... curious. If there exists at all, in any universe, a reason for not having a binary...
2010-02-23T15:54:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		just... curious
2010-02-23T15:54:00.000Z	jpds	uyjhgjhkg	Because noone has packaged it?
2010-02-23T15:55:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg	jpds	right. its just. ugh.
