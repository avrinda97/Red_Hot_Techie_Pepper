2010-09-20T13:40:00.000Z	rwhr		Hi all, I have a NAS drive and I want to sync my files onto it. I have installed luckybackup and grcync, but grcync doesn't recognise my smb drive and in luckybackup I can't find where I can exclude directories. Does anyone know a better way for me to setup my NAS so it is more compatible or is there a program that will let me synch better?
2010-09-20T13:40:00.000Z	rwhr		running ubuntu 10
2010-09-20T13:42:00.000Z	maedox	rwhr	how did you mount the drive?
2010-09-20T13:46:00.000Z	rwhr	maedox	Places > Computer > Network > and then dragged and dropped the NAS onto the "Places" on the left of the screen (under desktop, file system, network, etc)
2010-09-20T13:47:00.000Z	rwhr	maedox	so now when I open it up, I get "smb://x.x.x.x/" on the location bar.
2010-09-20T13:48:00.000Z	maedox	rwhr	that might not be enough for the backup apps. Nautilus reads smb:// just fine, but those apps probably cant. you need to mound it with cifs.
2010-09-20T13:49:00.000Z	rwhr	maedox	cifs? (noob here)
2010-09-20T13:49:00.000Z	maedox	rwhr	add to /etc/fstab as root:    //NAS-IP_or_hostname /mount-point cifs uid=user,credentials=/home/user/.credentials.cifs 0 0
2010-09-20T13:54:00.000Z	rwhr	maedox	Thanks for that, I'll give it a go..
2010-09-20T14:22:00.000Z	rwhr	maedox	I've found th file and have copied it to my desktop so that I could edit it, but how do I put it back into the /etc as the file there is read only.
2010-09-20T14:23:00.000Z	maedox	rwhr	gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
2010-09-20T14:23:00.000Z	maedox	rwhr	that will edit it in place as root, so be careful not to mess with the other lines. ;)
2010-09-20T14:25:00.000Z	rwhr	maedox	so should this take effect immediately, if so, I have done something wrong..
2010-09-20T14:26:00.000Z	rwhr	maedox	do I just add it at the bottom of the file?
2010-09-20T14:26:00.000Z	maedox	rwhr	when you're done you do a sudo mount -a in a terminal. Let me know if you get any errors.
2010-09-20T14:26:00.000Z	maedox	rwhr	yes.
2010-09-20T14:31:00.000Z	rwhr	maedox	No errors, but also no apparent results :(
2010-09-20T14:31:00.000Z	maedox	rwhr	anything shown is the output of mount?   (without the -a)
2010-09-20T14:32:00.000Z	maedox	rwhr	is = in*
2010-09-20T14:33:00.000Z	rwhr	maedox	15 lines worth without the "-a"
2010-09-20T14:34:00.000Z	maedox	rwhr	anything about the NAS?
2010-09-20T14:36:00.000Z	rwhr	maedox	no.
