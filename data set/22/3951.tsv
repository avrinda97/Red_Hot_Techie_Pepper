2009-08-24T22:04:00.000Z	westherm		Can anyone help  with boot issues?
2009-08-24T22:04:00.000Z	apparle	westherm	everycan just state the problem
2009-08-24T22:05:00.000Z	apparle	westherm	everyone can just state the problem
2009-08-24T22:07:00.000Z	apparle	westherm	you mean you select your OS from GRUB and then you get this problem
2009-08-24T22:09:00.000Z	apparle	westherm	try a diffrent CD...........check if image is alright
2009-08-24T22:16:00.000Z	westherm	apparle	should I maybe look at the xconfig for my video card?
2009-08-24T22:16:00.000Z	apparle	westherm	did you try recovery mode
2009-08-24T22:17:00.000Z	westherm	apparle	yeah I did all the options in the recovery mode menu that seemed applicable
2009-08-24T22:17:00.000Z	westherm	apparle	I went with a clean install since there wasn't much to lose
2009-08-24T22:19:00.000Z	apparle	westherm	so you are unable to start even after clean install..........
2009-08-24T22:20:00.000Z	westherm	apparle	oh no, after the clean install everything is fine, I just haven't started dual monitors, because i don't want the same thing to happen again
2009-08-24T22:22:00.000Z	apparle	westherm	can't help with dual monitors coz I never used them..........better ask these guys to help you with dual monitors rather than asking boot problems
2009-08-24T22:22:00.000Z	westherm	apparle	thanks anyway
2009-08-24T22:33:00.000Z	apparle	westherm	which ATI card
2009-08-24T22:34:00.000Z	apparle	westherm	well then you can't use the officially(fglrx) drivers from ATI
2009-08-24T22:36:00.000Z	westherm	apparle	what do I do about that?
2009-08-24T22:37:00.000Z	apparle	westherm	that's the problem...........you have to use the opensource drivers and obviously they are not so good yet...........maybe they will be one day..........
2009-08-24T22:37:00.000Z	apparle	westherm	and by default you are using the opensource drivers
2009-08-24T22:38:00.000Z	westherm	apparle	its too bad it works right away when you config it
2009-08-26T21:19:00.000Z	westherm	apparle	I got my dual monitors to work the other day
2009-08-26T21:19:00.000Z	apparle	westherm	congrats
2009-08-26T21:19:00.000Z	westherm	apparle	just had to purge fglrx, the open source drivers were better
