2011-11-17T19:39:00.000Z	Error404NotFound		how can i create binary of a bash script that i have to distribute but i don't want anyone hacking around it?
2011-11-17T19:40:00.000Z	iceroot	Error404NotFound	?
2011-11-17T19:40:00.000Z	iceroot	Error404NotFound	you cant create a binary of a bash-script, bash script will be interpreted and not compiled
2011-11-17T19:41:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	iceroot	a simple bash script can be read in less, vim, or any editor. Have you install netbeans or java? remember those bin files that take care of all installation and you still can't hack them? a one in all bundled binary.
2011-11-17T19:42:00.000Z	iceroot	Error404NotFound	not possible
2011-11-17T19:42:00.000Z	iceroot	Error404NotFound	as i said bash is interpreted
2011-11-17T19:42:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	iceroot	not for bash scripts? what alernates are there besides doing it all in C?
2011-11-17T19:42:00.000Z	iceroot	Error404NotFound	java is build into classes
2011-11-17T19:42:00.000Z	iceroot	Error404NotFound	python, c, c++
2011-11-17T19:43:00.000Z	iceroot	Error404NotFound	or just use open-source!!!
2011-11-17T19:43:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	iceroot	hmmm, python, that might actually be a good option
2011-11-17T19:43:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	iceroot	closely integrates into out  system and i don't want my devs beeping our servers by playing with it and they will if they can view the code.
2011-11-17T19:44:00.000Z	iceroot	Error404NotFound	security through obscurity is always bad
2011-11-17T19:44:00.000Z	iceroot	Error404NotFound	a system is not safer because you cant read the source-code
2011-11-17T19:45:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	iceroot	agreed, strongly agreed, but for a quick patch i want something, later can get one of sysadmins to limit incoming data
2011-11-17T19:45:00.000Z	iceroot	Error404NotFound	strace your-binary
2011-11-17T19:45:00.000Z	iceroot	Error404NotFound	and i see what it is doing
2011-11-17T19:46:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	iceroot	by the time devs would google and learn about strace, systems would be already fixed :)
2011-11-17T19:46:00.000Z	iceroot	Error404NotFound	sounds like a very strange security-concept
2011-11-17T19:46:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	iceroot	you have to have make harsh and stupid decisions when you aren't just a sysadmin but a manager running short of time.
2011-11-17T19:47:00.000Z	iceroot	Error404NotFound	its always bad if a manager has contact to a system
2011-11-17T19:47:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	iceroot	arguable but offtopic and hence left.
