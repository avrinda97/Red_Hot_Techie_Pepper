2010-10-13T05:45:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		Good evening :)
2010-10-13T05:46:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		I am installing Ubuntu inside windows from a USB key, and it seems that even though I downloaded the i386 ISO - it is installing a 64bit OS. Is this normal?
2010-10-13T05:46:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		My arc his intel i5 64, but I want to install the 32bit OS.
2010-10-13T05:46:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		arch
2010-10-13T05:46:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		Hmm
2010-10-13T05:46:00.000Z	Scunizi	MichaelBehan	you can do that with no problem
2010-10-13T05:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	MichaelBehan	if your machine is 64 bit you have the option of 64 or 32 bit OS.. if your machine was only 32 bit then you *would not* be able to run a 64 bit
2010-10-13T05:47:00.000Z	MichaelBehan	Scunizi	I don't recall that option. Is it offered when installing inside windows?
2010-10-13T05:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	MichaelBehan	ah .. are you using Wubi? to install inside of windows? .. personally I wouldn't.. install Virtualbox in windows and then Ubuntu in that
2010-10-13T05:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	MichaelBehan	virtualbox.org
2010-10-13T05:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	MichaelBehan	it allows you to create virtual machines inside of different OS's
2010-10-13T05:52:00.000Z	MichaelBehan	Scunizi	Pretty neat.. looks better than vmware
2010-10-13T05:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	MichaelBehan	yea.. I used Vmware for several years.. vbox is cleaner, lighter and easier.
2010-10-13T05:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	MichaelBehan	no. use vbox..
2010-10-13T05:53:00.000Z	MichaelBehan	Scunizi	?
2010-10-13T05:53:00.000Z	MichaelBehan	Scunizi	Again it seems like running a vm inside windows would be a big performance hit
2010-10-13T05:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	MichaelBehan	wubi is kinda like a dual boot but will interfere with windows normal boot loader.. if you can't dual boot with a work machine then don't use wubi..  there really isn't much of a performance hit these days..
2010-10-13T05:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	MichaelBehan	you can ctrl+f for full screen in vbox .. it'll totally cover the windows ui
2010-10-13T05:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	MichaelBehan	wubi will change the boot loader to Grub
2010-10-13T05:57:00.000Z	MichaelBehan	Scunizi	That's fine
2010-10-13T05:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	MichaelBehan	live usb boot ? :D
2010-10-13T05:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	MichaelBehan	linux boot at home .. ssh in from work and run the desktop
