2008-02-14T05:31:00.000Z	prince_jammys	macogw	no, i was saying i know that i does do ntfs
2008-02-19T10:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	macogw	console only?
2008-02-19T10:40:00.000Z	macogw	prince_jammys	^
2008-02-21T18:24:00.000Z	macogw	prince_jammys	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2008-02-21T18:32:00.000Z	macogw	prince_jammys	by "basic install" do you mean the server install im suggesting? or is there something i ont know about?
2008-02-21T18:34:00.000Z	macogw	prince_jammys	Blastur: i think the only text-only system after install is the server one.  there's a server cd that does that, alternate which uses debian's text installer but results in a gui system, and the live cd which has a gui installer and results in a gui system
2008-02-21T18:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	macogw	that's what i thought - but somebody here told me otherwise.
2008-02-21T18:45:00.000Z	macogw	prince_jammys	oh you cant cd into non-executable directories, huh?  guess thats why i set noexec!
2008-02-28T01:26:00.000Z	macogw	prince_jammys	i am who i am because of who we all are
2008-02-28T01:26:00.000Z	macogw	prince_jammys	i think thats the usual way its phrased if youre using that definition
2008-03-10T13:33:00.000Z	macogw	prince_jammys	it's a permissions problem because of some config files that were changed.  can't purge the config files now though :-/
2008-03-10T13:34:00.000Z	prince_jammys	macogw	what aaout trying to reinstall the package, and then purge it?
2008-03-10T13:34:00.000Z	macogw	prince_jammys	well he's already reinstalled it once...
2008-03-10T13:35:00.000Z	macogw	prince_jammys	he said he had a "bad version" (the version where he broke the config) so he uninstalled and reinstalled hoping itd overwrite the broken config
2008-03-10T14:07:00.000Z	macogw	prince_jammys	leave 'im be. i'm helping him out and i dont feel like joining #html just to do so
2008-03-11T08:09:00.000Z	macogw	prince_jammys	you around?
2008-03-11T08:09:00.000Z	prince_jammys	macogw	what's up?
2008-03-11T08:09:00.000Z	macogw	prince_jammys	he got it installed and then left when he was waiting for the 200+ updates to install
2008-03-11T08:10:00.000Z	prince_jammys	macogw	very good
