2008-01-08T07:07:00.000Z	joh6nn		anybody here ever use apt-cacher?
2008-01-08T07:07:00.000Z	gyaresu	joh6nn	Have you got a specific problem with it?
2008-01-08T07:08:00.000Z	joh6nn	gyaresu	i've tried following some online tutorials on installing it and setting it up, and i don't have any problem following the instructions.  but when i get to actually testing it (running apt-get update, or checking http://localdomain.localhost:3142/), i only get error messages
2008-01-08T07:15:00.000Z	gyaresu	joh6nn	Yeah. I'm asking if you can ping both hostname and hostname.domainname
2008-01-08T07:09:00.000Z	gyaresu	joh6nn	That's not your IP or hostname:  http://localdomain.localhost:3142
2008-01-08T07:10:00.000Z	joh6nn	gyaresu	yeah, i know, i was generalizing, because http://icarus.local/ isn't nearly as useful to you
2008-01-08T07:10:00.000Z	gyaresu	joh6nn	I disagree. Literal strings are far more useful.
2008-01-08T07:11:00.000Z	gyaresu	joh6nn	Which tutorial are you using?
2008-01-08T07:12:00.000Z	joh6nn	gyaresu	http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-set-up-a-repository-cache-with-apt-cacher
2008-01-08T07:13:00.000Z	gyaresu	joh6nn	Running it locally or on a server on your lan?
2008-01-08T07:13:00.000Z	joh6nn	gyaresu	server on the lan
2008-01-08T07:14:00.000Z	gyaresu	joh6nn	can you ping icarus.local or is it possibly that your router isn't doing dns well and you just need to change it to icarus
2008-01-08T07:14:00.000Z	joh6nn	gyaresu	i can ping icarus just fine; i almost never actually sit at it; i usually just ssh in
2008-01-08T07:16:00.000Z	joh6nn	gyaresu	sorry.  i can ping icarus.local, but icarus is a no-go
2008-01-08T07:17:00.000Z	gyaresu	joh6nn	Maybe set icarus in your /etc/hosts file via its IP.
2008-01-08T07:35:00.000Z	joh6nn	gyaresu	ok, i seem to have gotten things closer to working; icarus.local seems to be resolving properly, now
2008-01-08T07:35:00.000Z	gyaresu	joh6nn	cool.
2008-01-08T07:36:00.000Z	joh6nn	gyaresu	i'm not sure that i'm getting the results i should be, though
2008-01-08T07:37:00.000Z	gyaresu	joh6nn	Error message?
2008-01-08T07:37:00.000Z	joh6nn	gyaresu	no error message, just not what i'm expecting to see.  i'm using Acquire::http::Proxy “http://icarus.local:3142″; in apt.conf to forward my sources.list through my Icarus box
2008-01-08T07:39:00.000Z	gyaresu	joh6nn	Sorry. I'm not familiar enough to suggest other than hashing out the outside references. (Or just create a new apt.conf and backup the working one.
2008-01-08T07:40:00.000Z	joh6nn	gyaresu	all right, well i'm farther than i was before, so thanks.  ; )
