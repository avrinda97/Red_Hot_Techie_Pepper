2007-07-01T06:26:00.000Z	bruenig	arje1	tell me what you did
2007-07-01T06:27:00.000Z	bruenig	arje1	what command did you use

2007-07-01T06:27:00.000Z	bruenig	arje1	what is the /dev/name of the drive
2007-07-01T06:28:00.000Z	bruenig	arje1	no, do sudo fdisk -l and tell me what the /dev/name is
2007-07-01T06:29:00.000Z	bruenig	arje1	ok do sudo umount /dev/sda2
2007-07-01T06:31:00.000Z	bruenig	arje1	copy and paste my command
2007-07-01T06:32:00.000Z	bruenig	arje1	I have done that
2007-07-01T06:33:00.000Z	bruenig	arje1	umount is a command line program
2007-07-01T06:33:00.000Z	bruenig	arje1	but it might as well be, you will not find a linux distro that does not have umount
2007-07-01T06:36:00.000Z	arje1	bruenig	my /home partitions is /logical and wrapped inside an extended partition
2007-07-01T06:36:00.000Z	bruenig	arje1	ok
2007-07-01T06:38:00.000Z	arje1	bruenig	whenever i try to do any file operations i get an error saying i do not have permission
