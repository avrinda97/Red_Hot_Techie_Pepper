2007-09-05T08:17:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	you are communicating at a very high speed
2007-09-05T08:17:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	64bytes at 1ns - wow
2007-09-05T08:17:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	what did you ping?
2007-09-05T08:18:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	I want you to try and ping google, "ping www.google.com" and tell me the results
2007-09-05T08:19:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	how are you on irc at #ubuntu?
2007-09-05T08:20:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	so you are only having problems with a wifi problem?
2007-09-05T08:20:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	you can ping the schools router at 1ns 64bytes etc.?
2007-09-05T08:21:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	with the wifi?
2007-09-05T08:22:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	if you can ping the router with the laptop quickly, and you can then it sounds to me either 1. a firewall on the laptop or 2. you no longer have the right essid and/or password.
2007-09-05T08:24:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	are you sure, if you can use internet/irc with the desktop then there has to be something stopping the connection, but your wifi is obviously working perfectly.  So there seems only 2 possibilities.
2007-09-05T08:25:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	what port are you connecting to the router on?
2007-09-05T08:26:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	have you used it for another wireless setup before?
2007-09-05T08:27:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	all ports are open, on both the router and laptop, and you are sure of this.
2007-09-05T08:28:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	s/./?
2007-09-05T08:30:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	are you using firestarter for your firewall?
2007-09-05T08:32:00.000Z	yigal	krammer	I have had problems before with firestarter.  It will say that I have killed it and it is off but it is still working, this is funny but try removing it for a little while - if you can without worry too much about security
