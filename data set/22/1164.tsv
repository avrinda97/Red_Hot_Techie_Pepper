2010-09-09T06:56:00.000Z	VintageRitz		hello all. I'm new to irc (first time, I've never been able to get connected before), and relatively new to Ubuntu. My tech-support son is at college and unavailable and I'm far to embarrassed to tell him I've been messing with my system anyway :/  Problem is my cd/dvd drive. Something isn't working and I receive a message at boot that says      mount: mounting none on /dev failed..... I've spent the last two days in the support docs look
2010-09-09T06:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	VintageRitz	the last part of your post got chopped.. what exactly isn't working with the cd/dvd rom?  Can't play a commercial movie?
2010-09-09T06:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	VintageRitz	and that was it? .. nothing there to suggest that it's the cd/dvd rom .. was there more to it?
2010-09-09T07:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	VintageRitz	what program are you trying to use to do that?
2010-09-09T07:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	VintageRitz	arg.. no experience with that program.. but are you basically telling it to burn "data" and then tagging files or directories?
2010-09-09T07:01:00.000Z	VintageRitz	Scunizi	right.
2010-09-09T07:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	VintageRitz	might be gnomebaker, might be a bad disk.. personally I"d install k3b .. it's pretty much the defacto standard for burning cd's/dvd's .. and the interface is "nicer"
2010-09-09T07:03:00.000Z	VintageRitz	Scunizi	k3b?
2010-09-09T07:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	VintageRitz	yes.. it's actually a kde program but runs fine on gnome (providing you know the difference :)  ).. the software center should have it listed or Synaptic package manager or from terminal you can type ... sudo apt-get install k3b
2010-09-09T07:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	VintageRitz	use a persons "nick" when responding and your responses won't get lost in the noise.... there are over 1000 people here
2010-09-09T07:06:00.000Z	VintageRitz	Scunizi	I'm getting that. Thanks
2010-09-09T07:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	VintageRitz	Hey... I'm over 50 and I can do this stuff too!  :)  <---- smiley face
2010-09-09T07:08:00.000Z	VintageRitz	Scunizi	yes, I am trying to burn, but I tried playing a dvd to check the drive
2010-09-09T07:09:00.000Z	VintageRitz	Scunizi	and the dvd wouldn't play.....and got stuck in the device for the rest of the day.
2010-09-09T07:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	VintageRitz	if it's a commercial dvd you need the right "codecs" to decode it..
2010-09-09T07:09:00.000Z	VintageRitz	Scunizi	it was commercial and I have all the updated restricted's.
2010-09-09T07:10:00.000Z	VintageRitz	Scunizi	(I duck fast, don't I)
2010-09-09T07:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	VintageRitz	but are they from the medibuntu repositories?  that's the only place to get the libdvdcss(version number)..
2010-09-09T07:11:00.000Z	VintageRitz	Scunizi	yep, from the mediabuntu reps. just checked them tonight (using the terminal I might add. I was very proud of myself)
2010-09-09T07:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	VintageRitz	Once you catch on this stuff will be easier... and an adventure. I've gotta go so I'll let lulu7 finish up.. good luck.
2010-09-09T07:12:00.000Z	VintageRitz	Scunizi	I know and thanks
2010-09-09T08:24:00.000Z	VintageRitz	Scunizi	hey, you came back. Missed the chaos?
