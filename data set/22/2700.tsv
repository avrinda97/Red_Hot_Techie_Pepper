2009-08-13T10:32:00.000Z	maco	Voltaire	i <3 split pane in dolphin. i think you can just click the middle button on the right
2009-08-13T10:32:00.000Z	maco	Voltaire	you know minimize, maximize/restore, close...?
2009-08-13T10:32:00.000Z	maco	Voltaire	i dont use a normal window manager so i cant really try though
2009-08-13T10:33:00.000Z	Voltaire	maco	but atlast there are no minimize, maximize, close buttons
2009-08-13T10:34:00.000Z	Voltaire	maco	its full screen with no titlebar, started the menus
2009-08-13T10:34:00.000Z	maco	Voltaire	oh...i dont see a fullscreen option in any of the menus. is your window manager crashed?
2009-08-13T10:35:00.000Z	Voltaire	maco	doubtfull, I can tab about of it and see other apps and they work fine, even rebooted
2009-08-13T10:36:00.000Z	maco	Voltaire	:-/ this reminds me of a bug i saw filed where firefox would do the same thing
2009-08-13T10:37:00.000Z	maco	Voltaire	but i think the firefox thing only happened when firefox and compiz intersected and only for a handful of people
2009-08-13T10:37:00.000Z	maco	Voltaire	i assume youre using kwin?
2009-08-13T10:39:00.000Z	Voltaire	maco	good question, pretty sure, I'm running doliphin in a gnome environment, but I don't think that would matter any
2009-08-13T10:39:00.000Z	maco	Voltaire	are you using kubuntu or are you using dolphin in ubuntu?
2009-08-13T10:39:00.000Z	maco	Voltaire	ok then its either metacity or compiz. is it composited?
2009-08-13T10:39:00.000Z	maco	Voltaire	this sounds like youve found another piece of that annoying compiz bug
2009-08-13T10:40:00.000Z	Voltaire	maco	haha oh joy
2009-08-13T10:40:00.000Z	Voltaire	maco	thanks for the tibit, I think I know how to fix it
2009-08-13T10:41:00.000Z	maco	Voltaire	nkwith ff, youd hit f11 twice, i thi
2009-08-13T10:41:00.000Z	maco	Voltaire	with ff youd hit f11 twice i think*
2009-08-13T10:42:00.000Z	Voltaire	maco	or that would work, beats what I was thinking about doing, now to get my vnc to like me enough to let me do that
2009-08-13T10:46:00.000Z	Voltaire	maco	Thanks got it, the f11 trick didn't work, i just switched to metacity.
2009-08-13T10:47:00.000Z	maco	Voltaire	ok well glad something worked for you
