2009-05-27T03:10:00.000Z	Shooree		how would I get Jaunty's sources.list into 8.10?
2009-05-27T03:10:00.000Z	tones	Shooree	copy them?
2009-05-27T03:11:00.000Z	tones	Shooree	not reccomended though
2009-05-27T03:11:00.000Z	Shooree	tones	yea, but I don't know the addy. I just want a painless install of a single updated thingy.
2009-05-27T03:11:00.000Z	tones	Shooree	i dont know what the thingy youre on about
2009-05-27T03:12:00.000Z	Shooree	tones	just a piece of software thats updated there
2009-05-27T03:12:00.000Z	Shooree	tones	and I'm too stupid to do it the right way.
2009-05-27T03:12:00.000Z	tones	Shooree	i still dont know what the thingy youre on about
2009-05-27T03:13:00.000Z	Shooree	tones	it doesn't matter. I'd just like to know how to include Jaunty's repositories
2009-05-27T03:13:00.000Z	tones	Shooree	just copy them, shall i send them?
2009-05-27T03:13:00.000Z	tones		man modprobe
2009-05-27T03:14:00.000Z	Shooree	tones	form where do I copy them? I thought it was something like http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu
2009-05-27T03:14:00.000Z	Shooree	tones	am I wrong? I thought it would be just like adding any other source list
2009-05-27T03:14:00.000Z	tones	Shooree	just open your /etc/apt/sources.list and append the repositories you need
2009-05-27T03:15:00.000Z	Shooree	tones	right. but where do I find the address? sorry for being dense.
2009-05-27T03:15:00.000Z	tones	Shooree	no problem, i can send them over, im on jaunty
2009-05-27T03:15:00.000Z	Shooree	tones	it would be much obliged
2009-05-27T03:15:00.000Z	tones	Shooree	so be it, few secs
