2006-09-05T16:01:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	dns21	you after build-essential package?
2006-09-05T16:03:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	dns21	there is no c compiler installed by default you will need to install it using apt-get
2006-09-05T16:03:00.000Z	dns21	TheGateKeeper	i see
2006-09-05T16:14:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	dns21	:-)
2006-09-05T16:04:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	dns21	depending on what your sources you may have a choice of versions
2006-09-05T16:06:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	dns21	apt:/search?gcc <---- in konqueror you also probable want build-essential as well
2006-09-05T16:11:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	dns21	don't know if you would find this usefull at all ----> http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper
2006-09-05T16:13:00.000Z	dns21	TheGateKeeper	looks like it could be useful, all information is usually useful (most of the time)
2006-09-05T16:17:00.000Z	dns21	TheGateKeeper	i use mplayer for all of my media, sometimes xmms, but i want to get rythmbox to play mp3s so i can use it with my ipod, any idea why it doesn't let me add mp3's to my library?
2006-09-05T16:17:00.000Z	dns21	TheGateKeeper	i've got lame and win32codecs and everything installed
2006-09-05T16:19:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	dns21	for me I use KDE, amarok, xine engine and libxine-extracodecs is the codec that gives me mp3 :-)
2006-09-05T16:20:00.000Z	dns21	TheGateKeeper	does amarok communicate with ipod (shuffle)? i've never used amarok
2006-09-05T16:21:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	dns21	to be honest I am not sure, don't use ipod
2006-09-05T16:22:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	dns21	^^^^^
2006-09-05T16:27:00.000Z	dns21	TheGateKeeper	sweet, thank you, i haven't seen that yet, it looks like i need to installed the gstreamer stuff, it looks like rhythmbox doesn't like to use of codecs i already have installed
2006-09-05T16:28:00.000Z	dns21	TheGateKeeper	you were a big help, whenever i use google it seems i end up searching through a heap of material that i don't need to know
2006-09-05T16:28:00.000Z	dns21	TheGateKeeper	thank you very much
2006-09-05T16:29:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	dns21	yw :-) hope you get it working, if you have a choice of engines as amarok gives to you could always use xine & libxine-extracodes
2006-09-05T16:29:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	dns21	off to bed now, best of luck :-)
2006-09-05T16:29:00.000Z	dns21	TheGateKeeper	amarok looks very nice, maybe a little to feature-rich and bloated for me
2006-09-05T16:30:00.000Z	dns21	TheGateKeeper	good night
2006-09-05T16:30:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	dns21	what you get with a standard kubuntu install, good night :-)
