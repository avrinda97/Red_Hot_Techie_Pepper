2009-10-18T06:56:00.000Z	canthus13	Guest60430	What are you trying to do?
2009-10-18T06:58:00.000Z	canthus13	Guest60430	You don't have administrator access?
2009-10-18T06:58:00.000Z	canthus13	Guest60430	Which drivers are you installing?
2009-10-18T07:04:00.000Z	canthus13	Guest60430	Hmm. Not sure, really.
2009-10-18T07:04:00.000Z	canthus13	Guest60430	Which version are you using?
2009-10-18T07:09:00.000Z	Guest60430	canthus13	- so do u know what i have to type in the terminal to access administrator mode
2009-10-18T07:09:00.000Z	canthus13	Guest60430	Preface whatever command you're using with sudo
2009-10-18T07:09:00.000Z	canthus13	Guest60430	It will then ask you for your password, and run the command as administrator.
2009-10-18T07:10:00.000Z	canthus13	Guest60430	Err... You can't install video drivers in wine, can you?
2009-10-18T07:12:00.000Z	Guest60430	canthus13	- well it opened up wizard but i guess i'll try with just linux
2009-10-18T07:13:00.000Z	canthus13	Guest60430	I've never had to install windows drivers for wine.
