2010-01-03T10:13:00.000Z	pfifo		how?
2010-01-03T10:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pfifo	add the medibuntu repo and install either w32codecs or w64codecs depending on where you're using 32 or 64 bit - this is generally all the microsoft-style video/audio codecs.
2010-02-09T06:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pfifo	chrome isn't - that's from google directly, but the open source chromium is.  and hhfkhc doesn't know what he's talking about.
2010-05-08T04:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pfifo	you want create an ISO of an audio CD - you could make an image with a bin/cue but NOT iso
2010-05-08T04:57:00.000Z	pfifo	ZykoticK9	how? bin/cue iso i dont care as long as it works with wodim
2010-05-08T04:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pfifo	not sure man, you'd have to research that one.  good luck.
2010-09-01T11:37:00.000Z	pfifo	ZykoticK9	thats what i recommended
2010-09-01T10:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pfifo	as that is not a support question you really should ask in #ubuntu-offtopic and yes i know, there are a lot fewer people :(
2010-09-01T11:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pfifo	no, but "free" the memory command will
2010-09-01T11:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pfifo	"sudo fdisk -l" would work as well
2010-09-01T11:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pfifo	lol - is this gentoo all of a sudden?
2010-09-01T11:31:00.000Z	pfifo	ZykoticK9	nice to know someone know where i learned that trick
2010-09-01T11:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pfifo	swap is memory
2010-09-01T11:36:00.000Z	pfifo	ZykoticK9	are you saying df -h WILL show swap?
2010-09-01T11:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pfifo	lol sorry, you actually beat me too it - didn't notice your reply
2010-09-01T11:38:00.000Z	pfifo	ZykoticK9	lol
2010-09-07T00:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pfifo	do you mean brasero?
2010-09-08T07:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pfifo	assuming you can use the current driver just use "sudo apt-get install nvidia-current" or you could try running "jockey" which is Hardware Drivers executable
2010-09-08T07:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pfifo	don't download the drivers unless you really need to - using apt is much more supported (at least here)
2010-09-08T07:49:00.000Z	pfifo	ZykoticK9	Izinucs, renedox thanks
2011-04-17T03:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pfifo	are you sure about that?  I heard gnome-shell was broken on Ubuntu, due to some bug...
2011-04-17T03:57:00.000Z	pfifo	ZykoticK9	i think its a bug in gcc4.4 i had some serious issues installing a cross compiler, but until i see the error or bug repot i cant say for sure
