2008-10-17T17:16:00.000Z	Blaise		How can I fix my sound?
2008-10-17T17:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Blaise	do you get any sound from anything at all?
2008-10-17T17:17:00.000Z	Blaise	ActionParsnip	No, Firefox crashes when I try flash with sound (YouTube), and Songbird has a GStreamer error
2008-10-17T17:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Blaise	1 thing at a time dude
2008-10-17T17:18:00.000Z	Blaise	ActionParsnip	hah, ok, then the answer is no
2008-10-17T17:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Blaise	ok flash with firefox is easy, uninstall whatever you have installed then apt-get install flashplugin non-free and nspluginwrapper
2008-10-17T17:19:00.000Z	Blaise	ActionParsnip	sorry, this is a system wide sound issue, it's not Flash related, this I am certain
