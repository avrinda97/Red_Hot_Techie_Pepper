2008-08-09T14:12:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	arwan	You said you used slack?
2008-08-09T14:13:00.000Z	arwan	joejoecircusboy	yes I did for a couple of years
2008-08-09T14:14:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	arwan	So you should be familiar with ifconfig's output and meaning.... I suggest you take a snapshot of 'ifconfig -a' before and after you 'fiddle' and see what changed
2008-08-09T14:15:00.000Z	arwan	joejoecircusboy	yes I'm familiar with it's output... and to be honest I thik it's this avahi that was throwing me off, got a bit agrevated
2008-08-09T14:16:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	arwan	why do you think it's avahi?
2008-08-09T14:16:00.000Z	arwan	joejoecircusboy	not sure, just thing this feeling... but by now I'm not sure of anything anymore
2008-08-09T14:17:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	arwan	Hmm.. does avahi play with routing interfaces at all? I though it was just about service discovery on the local network
2008-08-09T14:18:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	arwan	routing or* interfaces
2008-08-09T14:18:00.000Z	arwan	joejoecircusboy	I have no idea what avahi actually does, and don't really understand it's purpose (being a slackware user who loves manual configuration for this kind of stuff)
2008-08-09T14:19:00.000Z	arwan	joejoecircusboy	but I suggest you don't waste your time on me. I will follow Wols advice and see where that gets me
2008-08-09T14:19:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	arwan	manual interfaces? That's a bit of a hack
2008-08-09T14:20:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	arwan	IMO, if something is wrong  you should try to fix it rather than pulling the rug out, so to speak
2008-08-09T14:22:00.000Z	arwan	joejoecircusboy	I share that opinion... I would love to find the cause of this problem... but I should also get some work done, so I might just take the fast route this time
2008-08-09T14:22:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	arwan	understandable
2008-08-09T14:23:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	arwan	btw, do you have multiple interfaces?
2008-08-09T14:23:00.000Z	arwan	joejoecircusboy	yes, a wired and a wireless one
2008-08-09T14:23:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	arwan	if the manual config doesn't work, you may want to take a closer look at the interface naming - make sure it's consistent between boots and after fiddling
2008-08-09T14:24:00.000Z	arwan	joejoecircusboy	you mean that just maybe the first I boot my wireless gets named eth1 and trhe second time it gets named eth0 ?
2008-08-09T14:25:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	arwan	ya, ubuntu uses udev to do interface naming - I've seen it get confused
2008-08-09T14:26:00.000Z	arwan	joejoecircusboy	aha, that would explain a whole lot! Wols mention something about udev earlier on too
2008-08-09T14:26:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	arwan	and don't forget to look into your pppoe conf :P
2008-08-09T14:27:00.000Z	arwan	joejoecircusboy	grrrrr :p hehe
