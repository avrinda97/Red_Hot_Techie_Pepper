2007-02-11T06:53:00.000Z	Trixsey	I-m-new	dont bother updating now.. wait 2 months and update to the next distro :P
2007-02-11T06:54:00.000Z	I-m-new	Trixsey	so can i update it to 6.10?
2007-02-11T06:54:00.000Z	Trixsey	I-m-new	you could do a dist upgrade.. but thats not recommended I think? clean install is better.. I always do clean install ;P
2007-02-11T06:54:00.000Z	Trixsey	I-m-new	but if you plan on doing a clean install I'd wait until the next version of Ubuntu comes.. that would be in April
2007-02-11T06:55:00.000Z	Trixsey	I-m-new	dual boot?
2007-02-11T06:55:00.000Z	Trixsey	I-m-new	well.. you could do a clean install still
2007-02-11T06:55:00.000Z	Trixsey	I-m-new	you aint running linux on the same partition as windows
2007-02-11T06:56:00.000Z	Trixsey	I-m-new	so you format your linux paritition and install it :P
2007-02-11T06:56:00.000Z	Trixsey	I-m-new	you don't *have to*.. but I would if I were you
2007-02-11T06:58:00.000Z	Trixsey	I-m-new	6.06 is not that old.. a year tops :P
2007-02-11T07:01:00.000Z	Trixsey	I-m-new	I'm using Edgy
