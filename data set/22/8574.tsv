2005-07-09T09:46:00.000Z	Gourami		well by then its too late to warn them hehe
2005-07-09T09:47:00.000Z	Gourami		I will have to schedule the shutdown for an hour or two later just to be on the safe side
2005-07-09T09:48:00.000Z	Gourami		anyone here got the random background script working ?
2005-07-09T09:49:00.000Z	nalioth	Gourami	you mean ranwp.sh?
2005-07-09T09:50:00.000Z	nalioth	Gourami	it worked just fine til i got some pix with blank spaces in their names
2005-07-09T09:50:00.000Z	nalioth	Gourami	however if you google ranwp.sh, you'll find variants of it, that are sposed to work with blank spaces
2005-07-09T09:51:00.000Z	Gourami	nalioth	I have tried it, and no matter white file I use as a background, I always get my current background replaced with a brown screen
2005-07-09T09:52:00.000Z	nalioth	Gourami	hmmm, mine worked until i got the blank spaces involved
2005-07-09T09:52:00.000Z	nalioth	Gourami	havent tried the variants, yet
2005-07-12T08:57:00.000Z	nalioth	Gourami	you'll probably need to put a head on it and adjust your settings once
2005-07-12T08:58:00.000Z	Gourami	nalioth	that would mean that I can't reboot it :(
2005-07-12T08:58:00.000Z	nalioth	Gourami	i don't understand
2005-07-12T08:59:00.000Z	Gourami	nalioth	I have had it connected to a monitor, took the monitor elsewhere and then switched it on whithout a monitor with the intention to vnc and it has reverted to 640x480 as max
2005-07-12T09:00:00.000Z	nalioth	Gourami	i see. do you have to vnc into it? or can you work it via ssh?
2005-07-12T09:01:00.000Z	nalioth	Gourami	ssh is your friend as far as remote administration
2005-07-12T09:01:00.000Z	Gourami	nalioth	 does that only allow terminal or desktop ?
2005-07-12T09:02:00.000Z	nalioth	Gourami	a default ssh session is text only, but you can get fancy with ssh tunnels + vnc
2005-07-12T09:03:00.000Z	Gourami	nalioth	thanks, good reference for me to read up ?
2005-07-12T09:03:00.000Z	nalioth	Gourami	i think so, i think every *nix user should be familiar with ssh
2005-07-12T09:03:00.000Z	nalioth	Gourami	built into ssh is sftp and scp
2005-07-23T08:29:00.000Z	nalioth	Gourami	a couple folks use it
2005-07-23T08:34:00.000Z	nalioth	Gourami	at the bottom of said window type /wc
