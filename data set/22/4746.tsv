2007-11-29T21:42:00.000Z	OpenGuru		hi all. Any one here with AMD HD 2600XT ?
2007-11-29T21:42:00.000Z	ikonia	OpenGuru	just ask the question
2007-11-29T21:44:00.000Z	ikonia	OpenGuru	its an ati card , so its touch and go
2007-11-29T21:45:00.000Z	OpenGuru	ikonia	i didn't get you. Only reason for going to AMD/ATI is upcoming opensource driver
2007-11-29T21:45:00.000Z	ikonia	OpenGuru	the open drivers won't be around for a while yet
2007-11-29T21:46:00.000Z	OpenGuru	ikonia	then which one you suggest then ? ATI 2600XT or nv 8600GT. Please help me in deciding. I need to give the orders tomorrow.
2007-11-29T21:46:00.000Z	ikonia	OpenGuru	at the moment I would always go nvidia
2007-11-29T21:47:00.000Z	ikonia	OpenGuru	that may change at some point in the future
2007-11-29T21:48:00.000Z	OpenGuru	ikonia	thanks for your view. At present I have nv 6200 card. Which has compiz black window bug since a year. So just want to confirm that 8600GT doesn't has any such bugs.
2008-04-08T21:54:00.000Z	ikonia	OpenGuru	your cpu is not 64bit os
2008-04-08T21:55:00.000Z	OpenGuru	ikonia	i am in 64bit machine. OS is also 64. i am trying to compile for i386 arch
2008-04-08T21:55:00.000Z	ikonia	OpenGuru	thats cross-compiling
2008-04-08T21:56:00.000Z	ikonia	OpenGuru	is your gcc compiler multi-lib
2008-04-08T21:56:00.000Z	OpenGuru	ikonia	sorry.. but how to check that.. ?
2008-04-08T21:56:00.000Z	ikonia	OpenGuru	is it the ubuntu gcc ?
2008-04-08T21:57:00.000Z	OpenGuru	ikonia	yes. . taken from ubuntu repo
2008-04-08T21:57:00.000Z	ikonia	OpenGuru	then it's not multi-lib
2008-04-08T21:57:00.000Z	OpenGuru	ikonia	i need the multi-lib ? do i need to compile gcc now ?
2008-04-08T21:58:00.000Z	ikonia	OpenGuru	you need a full 32bit lib and 64bit environment, you then need to build a bootstrapper gcc that is multi-lib, then use that to build a multi-lib gcc
2008-04-08T21:59:00.000Z	OpenGuru	ikonia	thanks.. I actually need to it for Zoto uploader compilation.. they have hardcoded thing for i386. I need hack..
2008-04-08T22:00:00.000Z	ikonia	OpenGuru	enjoy, if something is hardcoded for 32bit, I suspect you won't get it working 64bit
2008-04-08T22:00:00.000Z	OpenGuru	ikonia	thanks for helping.. let me check..
