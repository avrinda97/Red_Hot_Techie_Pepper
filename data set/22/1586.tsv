2011-05-04T07:54:00.000Z	Edgan		Anyone know how to remove launchers from the panel in Gnome3 fallback mode?
2011-05-04T07:56:00.000Z	red2kic	Edgan	ADD MORE LAUNCHERS. Start crying. I had the same thing. :\
2011-05-04T07:57:00.000Z	red2kic	Edgan	My solution? I ignored it and slowly making a switch to different environment.
2011-05-04T07:57:00.000Z	Edgan	red2kic	I know the nuclear option of how to get rid of them.
2011-05-04T07:57:00.000Z	red2kic	Edgan	Remove Gnome3?
2011-05-04T07:58:00.000Z	Edgan	red2kic	remove your user dconf file
2011-05-04T07:58:00.000Z	Edgan	red2kic	~/.config/dconf/user
2011-05-04T07:59:00.000Z	Edgan	red2kic	They must have been smoking something the day they made dconf binary format.
2011-05-04T08:00:00.000Z	red2kic	Edgan	I get the same feeling when Vista first came out. (So I made the switch to linux). And now Gnome3 is doing this! :(
2011-05-04T08:00:00.000Z	Edgan	red2kic	I have considered switching environments.
2011-05-04T08:00:00.000Z	Edgan	red2kic	They did the same shit, though not this bad, with Gnome2.
2011-05-04T08:00:00.000Z	red2kic	Edgan	Language. It's the policy here. .__.
2011-05-04T08:01:00.000Z	Edgan	red2kic	:P
2011-05-04T08:01:00.000Z	red2kic	Edgan	I love Gnome2. Now I'm using AwesomeWM. I need more time to absorb shortcuts.
2011-05-04T08:02:00.000Z	Edgan	red2kic	Sadly it takes them years to get it right. When they do, they are bored, so they start over. :\
2011-05-04T08:03:00.000Z	red2kic	Edgan	If it isn't broken, don't try to fix it. Also, it seems like everybody is always trying to reinvent the wheel and call it the new thing.
2011-05-04T08:04:00.000Z	Edgan	red2kic	Not invented here syndrome.
2011-05-04T08:07:00.000Z	Edgan	red2kic	I think that was nautilus, which can be brought back
2011-05-04T08:08:00.000Z	Edgan	red2kic	you need gnome-tweak-tool, and then set file manager | have file manager handle the desktop | on
2011-05-04T08:09:00.000Z	Edgan	red2kic	then run nautilus. I just tried it, it let me change my background.
2011-05-04T08:09:00.000Z	red2kic	Edgan	I like gconf-editor better. I'm just going to walk away from this cesspool. :)
2011-05-04T08:10:00.000Z	Edgan	red2kic	gconf-editor = dconf-editor now
