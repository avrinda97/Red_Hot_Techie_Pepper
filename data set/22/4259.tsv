2008-07-24T03:04:00.000Z	yowshi		anyone know a python tutorial that explain stuff in plain english?
2008-07-24T03:04:00.000Z	mgreen	yowshi	there is a great starter that i followed a while ago. hold on.
2008-07-24T03:04:00.000Z	mgreen	yowshi	http://www.diveintopython.org/ is great if you've got prior programming experience. good luck :)
2008-07-24T03:15:00.000Z	mgreen	yowshi	please address with nickname first. i missed your messages.
2008-07-24T03:16:00.000Z	mgreen	yowshi	and watch your language ;)
2008-07-24T03:17:00.000Z	mgreen	yowshi	as i said, that guide is for people with prior programming experience, which you seem to have. it's a different and, imo, excellent introduction to python
2008-07-24T03:18:00.000Z	yowshi	mgreen	i have programming experience. all the way up to visdual basic and delphi. i havent dsone anything for over 10 years though and am looking to get back into it
2008-07-24T03:18:00.000Z	mgreen	yowshi	that's great :) i gave you that link since i was in the same position some years ago. don't you like it?
2008-07-24T03:19:00.000Z	yowshi	mgreen	i do i just am new to python and i was commenting on the fact that a nice ease into things approach from a tutorial would be nicer
2008-07-24T03:20:00.000Z	mgreen	yowshi	there are lots of those too. i started with diveintopython, and i really liked it.
2008-07-24T03:20:00.000Z	yowshi	mgreen	i havent seen a single python tutorial that does
2008-07-24T03:20:00.000Z	mgreen	yowshi	http://www.sthurlow.com/python/lesson02/ there's your hello world :)
2008-07-24T03:21:00.000Z	mgreen	yowshi	FYI, 'python tutorial' on google
2008-07-24T03:22:00.000Z	yowshi	mgreen	heh i forgot i already found this one. was practically useless since it doesnt cover halfg the commands
2008-07-24T03:22:00.000Z	yowshi	mgreen	couldnt find how to get input from a user anywhere in it
2008-07-24T03:24:00.000Z	mgreen	yowshi	have you tried to use google? i found it with 'python user input'
2008-07-24T03:25:00.000Z	yowshi	mgreen	i was busy usiing google with python tutorial or python online classes since i dont just want to find out how to get input
2008-07-24T03:26:00.000Z	mgreen	yowshi	run this: python -c "a = raw_input('?: '); print a"
2008-07-24T03:26:00.000Z	yowshi	mgreen	yes i found the raw_input thing by accident from another tutorial and i wasnt explained when it was used
2008-07-24T03:27:00.000Z	mgreen	yowshi	this isn't really a python support forum, though. i'm sure that you'll manage with the help of our friend google :)
2008-07-24T03:28:00.000Z	yowshi	mgreen	yeah. thanks for the link, i didnt mean to have the convo continue
2008-07-24T03:28:00.000Z	mgreen	yowshi	no problem. good luck exploring python :) it's a great tool
