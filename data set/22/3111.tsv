2008-12-05T12:42:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin		YES!!! Get in!!
2008-12-05T12:44:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin		At least I can do some work now.XD
2008-12-05T12:45:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin		8.10's Pidgin is pretty cool.
2008-12-05T12:46:00.000Z	gbear14275	Lord`Saladin	the only thing I don't like about pidgin is i can't make group chats in msn
2008-12-05T12:47:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	gbear14275	Why ever not? I've not had any problems with doing it.
2008-12-05T12:48:00.000Z	gbear14275	Lord`Saladin	how do you do it?
2008-12-05T12:51:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	gbear14275	Open Window with first contact > Click on Conversation > More... > Initiate Chat. That will open a new tab for the group chat. Click on, whilst in that new tab, Conversation > Invite > Then choose who you want to invite.
2008-12-05T12:52:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	gbear14275	Though, that seems more complicated on the new Pidgin. Before, it was just a case of hitting Conversation > Invite and then selecting who you want in
2008-12-05T12:56:00.000Z	gbear14275	Lord`Saladin	man that is tedious to add a bunch of people
2008-12-05T12:59:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	gbear14275	Not that I can see. And, it seems that they made that worse... There used to be a list of all your online buddies show up, but that seems to have gone now. Hm. I'm not sure. Try "pidgin group chat mass invite" on Google. Might come up with something for you.
2008-12-05T13:00:00.000Z	gbear14275	Lord`Saladin	I still have my buddy list show up
2008-12-05T13:01:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	gbear14275	What version of Ubuntu are you running?
2008-12-05T13:02:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	gbear14275	Ah. Strange, I'll have to check it, though I don't do group chats often. Have you tried the ctrl key?
2008-12-05T13:03:00.000Z	gbear14275	Lord`Saladin	nope... ctrl wont highlight multple persons, and the only way I found to initiate a group chat was after I was in an IM window already
2008-12-05T13:06:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	gbear14275	In that case, I honestly don't know. I have only ever done one group chat before EVER on Pidgin, if not my life, and that was with two people other than myself. Lol. So it worked just fine for me
2008-12-05T13:07:00.000Z	gbear14275	Lord`Saladin	 :), I'm an online gamer although not WoW type stuff, its much lamer actually ;), but yeah, mass IM conversations were necessary for coordination
2008-12-05T13:09:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	gbear14275	You really can't get any lamer than WoW. But, as an alternative that is probably MUCH better...Why not use IRC? Not sure about Freenode as it's so big, but on other networks you can make your own rooms, and set them so only people you want can enter, or even SEE that the room exists.
2008-12-05T13:09:00.000Z	gbear14275	Lord`Saladin	www.worldofaegis.com, text based strategy game
2008-12-05T13:11:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	gbear14275	I think I've heard of it... I myself do text-based roleplay. But, I would say IRC is the way forward -- and it further ensure anonymity. I would hate having to give my MSN to all the people I RP with
2008-12-05T13:13:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	gbear14275	How many people would be on the chat? AJAX, from my experience can be BAD if a lot of people are on there, for chat anyway
2008-12-05T13:14:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	gbear14275	PM me for more info, this is decidedly off topic
2008-12-05T13:14:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	gbear14275	Not much hope of that, I'm afraid, Just for the way it works. PM me, and I will explain
