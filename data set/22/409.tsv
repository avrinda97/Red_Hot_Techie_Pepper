2011-11-17T20:56:00.000Z	Mkaysi	deej1976	That doesn't work, /etc/apt/preferences is ignored by apt
2011-11-17T20:58:00.000Z	deej1976	Mkaysi	Is the documentation out of date?
2011-11-17T20:58:00.000Z	Mkaysi	deej1976	That documentation works with Debian, but with Ubuntu that file is just ignored. I think that there might be a bug
2011-11-17T20:58:00.000Z	Mkaysi		*but not with Ubuntu
2011-11-17T21:04:00.000Z	deej1976	Mkaysi	apt-mark
2011-11-17T21:05:00.000Z	Mkaysi	deej1976	That isn't what I am trying to do. I am trying to add repository and give negative pin priority for packages in that repo by default

2011-11-17T21:10:00.000Z	Mkaysi	deej1976	Downgrading isn't what I am trying to do either. I probably can't downgrade 1000 packages very easily.
2011-11-17T21:11:00.000Z	deej1976	Mkaysi	At the bottom is setting up pinning, but it refers to  /etc/apt/preferences

2011-11-17T21:12:00.000Z	deej1976		bug 508545
2011-11-17T21:12:00.000Z	Mkaysi		But it says "Fix released"
2011-11-17T21:13:00.000Z	Mkaysi		And I am running Oneiric so it should have the fix
2011-11-17T21:13:00.000Z	deej1976	Mkaysi	Whats your aptitude versions?
2011-11-17T21:13:00.000Z	Mkaysi		http://pastie.org/2878594
2011-11-17T21:14:00.000Z	Mkaysi		I thought that aptitude is just frontend for apt.
2011-11-17T21:15:00.000Z	deej1976	Mkaysi	hmmm apt: version 0.4.10, any one got any more input?

2011-11-17T21:18:00.000Z	Mkaysi	deej1976	Apt pinning appears again, but /etc/apt/preferences and /etc/apt/preferences.d/* are ignored.
2011-11-17T21:18:00.000Z	deej1976	Mkaysi	file a bug prephaps
