2006-11-17T16:12:00.000Z	holycow		if you want something that actually follows the rules and doesn't ruin your system, use easyubuntu
2006-11-17T16:12:00.000Z	holycow		for gods sake, stop telling people to use automatix
2006-11-17T16:13:00.000Z	holycow		dude, one single suggestion to use automatix results in thousands of questions for bizarro issues that comeup
2006-11-17T16:14:00.000Z	holycow		thats a sideffect
2006-11-17T16:14:00.000Z	holycow		automatix completely bypasses the packaging system and does its own black magic in the back ground
2006-11-17T16:14:00.000Z	holycow		once you install automatix you have no clue whatsover what has been changed on your system
2006-11-17T16:14:00.000Z	holycow		its bad on microsoft levels
2006-11-17T16:14:00.000Z	holycow		it should be classified as the first piece of linux malware imho
2006-11-17T16:16:00.000Z	holycow		both projects are implicitly stupid
2006-11-17T16:16:00.000Z	holycow		they should simply be setting up metapackages and their own repos if they want to do it right
2006-11-17T16:18:00.000Z	nothlit	holycow	seveas's repo has  things like w32codecs and metapackages
2006-11-17T16:18:00.000Z	holycow	nothlit	exactly!
2006-11-17T16:21:00.000Z	nothlit	holycow	sudo basically sets a time when the permissions will expire and references that, which is automatically refreshed or manually refreshed with sudo -v, while sudo -k changes that timestamp to the current time and sudo -K obliterates it entirely
2006-11-17T16:22:00.000Z	holycow	nothlit	neat, i didn't know that
2006-12-13T15:51:00.000Z	nothlit	holycow	if it has a launchpad page it has some endorsement
2006-12-13T15:51:00.000Z	nothlit	holycow	things that aren't installed with the package manager are not always things that shouldn't be suggested
2006-12-13T15:51:00.000Z	holycow	nothlit	that is such a rare situation ... a situation not likely something that a noob should actually run into
2006-12-13T15:52:00.000Z	nothlit	holycow	it is, if the nvidia/ati drivers from the repos don't work for them... which isn't that uncommon
2006-12-13T15:53:00.000Z	holycow	nothlit	nonsense
2006-12-13T15:53:00.000Z	holycow	nothlit	for the ubuntu usergroup, if they cannot install drivers using a package manager they really should be using windows or whatever until we get our stuff to a point where they can
2006-12-13T15:54:00.000Z	holycow	nothlit	i might agree if we were talking about debian users or something
2006-12-13T15:54:00.000Z	nothlit	holycow	no i'm saying the drivers from the repos don't always work, and thats when users could install the one directly from the manufacturer
