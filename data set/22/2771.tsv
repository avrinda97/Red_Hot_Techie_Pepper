2009-03-15T04:13:00.000Z	arkady		why is the flash plugin 32-bits?
2009-03-15T04:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arkady	there is also a very good  64bit flash alpha/beta
2009-03-15T04:13:00.000Z	arkady	sebsebseb	is there a package?
2009-03-15T04:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arkady	nah you get it off Adobe's website some where, if your on 64bit
2009-03-15T04:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arkady	it's in development, but still rather good
2009-03-15T04:14:00.000Z	arkady	sebsebseb	meh, I recall that Debian Stable had it in non-free
2009-03-15T05:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arkady	there's a data loss bug with Ext4
2009-03-15T05:23:00.000Z	arkady	sebsebseb	exactly, just because it's in stable kernel doesn't mean you should "upgrade now"
2009-03-15T05:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arkady	I will get Alpha 6  soonish, not tonight,  but I am keeping Ext3 for now
2009-03-15T05:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arkady	what???//

2009-03-15T05:25:00.000Z	arkady	sebsebseb	(you would of course have to create your own from the packages in Ubuntu repos)
2009-03-15T05:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arkady	oh right, well  putting linux on a blueray disc would seem like a waste of one to me
2009-03-15T05:28:00.000Z	arkady	sebsebseb	I know a few people who could fill a blueray disk
2009-03-25T02:45:00.000Z	arkady	sebsebseb	you still have to convince people to use modern protocols like SIP
2009-03-25T02:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arkady	yeah I don't really do the VOIP thing myself, so SIP  I  don't know much about it
2009-03-25T02:45:00.000Z	arkady	sebsebseb	just be glad you don't have to set up a PBX
2009-03-25T02:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arkady	oh you know about setting up Asterisk?
2009-03-25T02:46:00.000Z	arkady	sebsebseb	not really, just know it's a pita
2009-03-25T02:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arkady	what you mean pita?
2009-03-25T02:47:00.000Z	arkady	sebsebseb	as in it's incredibly difficult, I would say harder than openvpn which I've only used once
2009-03-25T02:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arkady	harder than openvpn oh.  yeah the  Asterisk from Ubuntu repo didn't do much,  and  there was this guy that wanted me to help him set up Asterisk, and I had never done that before,  and we  kind of got there when from compiling from tar.gz I think.  now he found some guy that can help him,  and he was going to remote connect and set it up for him, but then he was like no.  learn Linux first
