2007-11-19T00:29:00.000Z	poeloq		hey guys
2007-11-19T00:30:00.000Z	poeloq		I'm trying to upgrade from 7.04 to 7.10 and it returns "failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu...." (4 or 5 lines worth of this message)
2007-11-19T00:30:00.000Z	poeloq		any ideas?
2007-11-19T00:31:00.000Z	Pelo	poeloq	 dl the alternate cd or the dvd and install from that, much quicker and safer in my opinion
2007-11-19T00:34:00.000Z	Pelo	poeloq	 is your /home on a sperate partition ?
2007-11-19T00:35:00.000Z	Pelo	poeloq	 just use gparted from the live cd to resize the partitons involved, or make a new partiton on your other hdd,  copy the /home stuff over and then edit your ftsab to match the new /home location
2007-11-19T00:35:00.000Z	Pelo	poeloq	 that's what I did
2007-11-19T00:36:00.000Z	Pelo	poeloq	 either but you wouild have to use ntfs-3g to mount your home partiton if in ntfs which is not 100% reliable , your best bet is ext3 frankly,  fat32 would be silly for a home partiton
2007-11-19T00:37:00.000Z	Pelo	poeloq	  you can always try this , if you need to have a fat32 partiton for some use, you can mount it inside the /home/user folder that way it is easily accissible
2007-11-19T00:52:00.000Z	poeloq	Pelo	URL?
2007-11-19T00:55:00.000Z	poeloq	Pelo	it looks too dark to me, but the icons have potential
2007-11-19T00:55:00.000Z	Pelo	poeloq	 why does your nick sound like my nickname in elementary school ?
2007-11-19T00:56:00.000Z	poeloq	Pelo	I don't know. Are u German, btw?
2007-11-19T00:56:00.000Z	Pelo	poeloq	french canadian
2007-11-19T00:57:00.000Z	poeloq	Pelo	cool, just thought because the blog was in German
2007-11-19T00:57:00.000Z	Pelo	poeloq	 I got that link from digg
2007-11-19T00:58:00.000Z	poeloq	Pelo	ic. cool.
2007-11-20T06:00:00.000Z	Pelo	poeloq	 mount your /home to a seperate partiton , seperate from /,  that will save all your settings and data ,
2007-11-20T06:01:00.000Z	poeloq	Pelo	including my system settings? i.e. like keyring, firefox settings etc pp
2007-11-20T06:01:00.000Z	Pelo	poeloq	yes
2007-11-20T06:01:00.000Z	poeloq	Pelo	thanks
2007-11-20T06:01:00.000Z	Pelo	poeloq	 for the apps you can try this little thing , but I am nto sure it works well   you can duplicate your packages setup by using
