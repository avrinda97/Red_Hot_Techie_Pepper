2008-04-12T10:50:00.000Z	bouma		greetings, ive just installed 7.10 :)
2008-04-12T10:51:00.000Z	bouma		ive got a nvidia 8400gs, and after a google i found the software sources and enabled all, then enabled the restricted driver, to get the closed source nvidia drivers.. but now my resolution max is too low
2008-04-12T10:52:00.000Z	xtknight	bouma	run "gksu nvidia-settings"
2008-04-12T10:53:00.000Z	bouma	xtknight	ah, i was wondering why the nvidia config wasnt on any of the menus, ive seen it on other linuxes
2008-04-12T10:53:00.000Z	xtknight	bouma	might be in applications->system->NVIDIA X Config
2008-04-12T10:54:00.000Z	bouma	xtknight	i have no applications-> system
2008-04-12T10:54:00.000Z	xtknight	bouma	otherwise need to install nvidia-settings from repository.  and besides, the shortcut doesn't run it as root so it's better to use gksu nvidia-settings.  otherwise you can only change resolutions, you can't update your X config.
2008-04-12T10:54:00.000Z	bouma	xtknight	the console command worked its running
2008-04-12T10:54:00.000Z	bouma	xtknight	but there is no menu item for it, which would have been nice
2008-04-12T10:55:00.000Z	xtknight	bouma	application->System tools ..?
2008-04-12T10:56:00.000Z	bouma	xtknight	the system menu is separate, but its not under preferences or administration, and ive rebooted
2008-04-12T10:56:00.000Z	xtknight	bouma	how did yo install nvidia drivers
2008-04-12T10:57:00.000Z	bouma	xtknight	i went to the system->administration->software sources, enabled all then went to system->administration->restricted driver manager, and ticked the one option for the nvidia driver
2008-04-12T10:58:00.000Z	xtknight	bouma	oh well.  like i say you can still make a shortcut.  it was there for me, at least, but i'm on Hardy
2008-04-12T10:58:00.000Z	bouma	xtknight	isnt 7.10 hardy ?
2008-04-12T10:58:00.000Z	bouma	xtknight	im using 7.10
2008-04-12T10:58:00.000Z	xtknight	bouma	7.10 is gutsy, 8.04 is hardy
2008-04-12T10:58:00.000Z	bouma	xtknight	right
2008-04-12T10:59:00.000Z	bouma	xtknight	can i upgrade from a 8.04cd ( when it finally comes out final.. possibly different number) without reinstalling
2008-04-12T11:01:00.000Z	xtknight	bouma	yes you can
2008-04-12T11:01:00.000Z	xtknight	bouma	you can upgrade 7.10->8.04, or you can download 8.04 and then incrementally upgrade into the final version.  you dont need a separate home dir
2008-04-12T11:02:00.000Z	bouma	xtknight	ok thanks, well it seems to be all good now, except i need a couple of hundred meg of patches, and think i might be better off just going to 8.04
