2008-03-20T02:09:00.000Z	PeterGriffin	docta_v	maybe dynamic cpu schaling ?
2008-03-20T02:09:00.000Z	PeterGriffin		scaling*
2008-03-20T02:09:00.000Z	docta_v		yeah i figured something like that
2008-03-20T02:09:00.000Z	docta_v		i'd just like to confirm either way
2008-03-20T02:09:00.000Z	docta_v		since this is a production system supporting 9 million users :)
2008-03-20T02:09:00.000Z	PeterGriffin	docta_v	do you have : /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/ file like that ?
2008-03-20T02:09:00.000Z	PeterGriffin	docta_v	nice :)
2008-03-20T02:10:00.000Z	PeterGriffin	docta_v	simultanoius ;) ?
2008-03-20T02:10:00.000Z	docta_v	PeterGriffin	ah yea i do
2008-03-20T02:10:00.000Z	docta_v		awesome thanks
2008-03-20T02:10:00.000Z	PeterGriffin	docta_v	np
2008-03-20T02:10:00.000Z	docta_v		cpuinfo_max_freq -> 2600000
2008-03-20T02:10:00.000Z	docta_v		so that's perfect
2008-03-20T02:10:00.000Z	PeterGriffin	docta_v	ok, i think you can cpu-freq-selector like that
2008-03-20T02:10:00.000Z	docta_v	PeterGriffin	not simultaneously thankfully
2008-03-20T02:11:00.000Z	PeterGriffin	docta_v	 :) but its nice to run ubuntu on it !
2008-03-20T02:11:00.000Z	docta_v		9 million per month
2008-03-20T02:11:00.000Z	docta_v	PeterGriffin	sadly this system is CentOS... our web farm and search farm is ubuntu
2008-03-20T02:11:00.000Z	docta_v		this system is a database
2008-03-20T02:11:00.000Z	docta_v		mysql enterprise doesn't provide debian packages
2008-03-20T02:11:00.000Z	docta_v		we were going to run ubuntu until we ran up against that
2008-03-20T02:12:00.000Z	PeterGriffin	docta_v	:)
