2006-11-02T08:46:00.000Z	Kingsqueak		is X session running as root?
2006-11-02T08:46:00.000Z	Kingsqueak		tell him to run it as the user he's logged in as
2006-11-02T08:48:00.000Z	francois	Kingsqueak	hey, i'm sorta stuck :S
2006-11-02T08:49:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	francois	as the user X is logged in as, run 'xterm' see if you can see the fonts
2006-11-02T08:49:00.000Z	francois	Kingsqueak	ok so run on the beta drivers, and then run xterm ? '
2006-11-02T08:50:00.000Z	francois	Kingsqueak	because right now i get this error http://pastebin.ca/233710
2006-11-02T08:50:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	francois	that error is because you are running that command as a different user than X is running as
2006-11-02T08:54:00.000Z	francois	Kingsqueak	ok now i have to reboot with the new drivers running ? and then run xterm ?
2006-11-02T08:59:00.000Z	francois	Kingsqueak	ok now i have to reboot with the new drivers running ? and then run xterm ?
2006-11-02T08:59:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	francois	you are mixing up the issues
2006-11-02T09:00:00.000Z	francois	Kingsqueak	it did and i could see the font no problem
2006-11-02T09:00:00.000Z	francois	Kingsqueak	but i'm just running the generic "nv" drivers right now
2006-11-02T09:00:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	francois	o.k. so you have the issue I had, the only way I fixed it was to run Beryl instead of compiz
2006-11-02T09:01:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	francois	I don't have much else to tell you other than it was a color mapping issue I never fixed
2006-11-02T09:01:00.000Z	francois	Kingsqueak	ok weird, but thanks for the help, i'm trying to get the new beta drivers to work, and when i use them it screwed up all my fonts, so its weird,
2006-11-02T09:04:00.000Z	francois	Kingsqueak	ok i'll try disabling glx and then beryl-manager
2006-11-02T09:04:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	francois	try beryl-manager first
2006-11-02T09:04:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	francois	if that doesn't fix you, then disable glx
2006-11-02T09:04:00.000Z	francois	Kingsqueak	ok, thanks a lot for the help
2006-11-02T09:04:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	francois	you should be able to just fire up beryl-manager right now in the running session
2006-11-02T09:05:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	francois	type it into the xterm you opened
2006-11-02T09:05:00.000Z	francois	Kingsqueak	yeah but i gotta reinstall it first
