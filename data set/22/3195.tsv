2011-09-01T20:33:00.000Z	peragrate		I was about to give up when I noticed that network manager was detecting the phone as a possible cellular connection: but it's grayed out and can't be accessed.
2011-09-01T20:33:00.000Z	peragrate		So the phone is detected by Ubuntu on some level, and it charges when plugged into the computer, but I can't interface with it as a user...
2011-09-01T20:34:00.000Z	peragrate		In the last month month and a variety of windows computer (maybe two or three) at internet cafes near my house...
2011-09-01T20:35:00.000Z	peragrate		No. It's an generic chinese phone. I think I said that as long as I've owned this phone, with this ubuntu install, I've never had problems.
2011-09-01T20:36:00.000Z	peragrate		But the system is acting a little funny. For example, one day I woke up and tried to access a folder throught the "Places" menu: everything in that menu now opens with VLC!!! I have no idea how to fix that either.
2011-09-01T20:37:00.000Z	peragrate		I don't know about the OS. I really don't know much about phones. It was bought in Asia, but as I said, I've never had any software issues or connection issues before and I've never used any software between the phone and computer at all. ever.
2011-09-01T20:38:00.000Z	peragrate		It's 11:30 pm here. I can't go buy additional hardware right now.
2011-09-01T20:38:00.000Z	peragrate		I really don't think it's hardware guys.
2011-09-01T20:38:00.000Z	peragrate		Hal is recognizing the mobile.
2011-09-01T20:38:00.000Z	peragrate		There's a screen shot of network manager identifying the phone on this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1837199
2011-09-01T20:39:00.000Z	beniwtv	peragrate	Anything in dmesg?
2011-09-01T20:40:00.000Z	beniwtv	peragrate	type in dmesg once, then plug in the phone and do another dmesg and see the new lines
2011-09-01T20:40:00.000Z	beniwtv	peragrate	maybe we can find out if it uses mass storage or something else (mass storage would be a lot easier)
2011-09-01T20:41:00.000Z	beniwtv	peragrate	use a pastenbin site
2011-09-01T20:52:00.000Z	beniwtv	peragrate	There's nothing in the dmesg log, you will have to connect it for that
2011-09-01T21:04:00.000Z	beniwtv	peragrate	no, still here :), we need now a pastebin after you connected the phone
2011-09-01T21:05:00.000Z	beniwtv	peragrate	I don't see any USB connection notices
2011-09-01T21:06:00.000Z	beniwtv	peragrate	Is it USB?
2011-09-01T21:10:00.000Z	beniwtv	peragrate	That's odd - if NM finds it there must be something in dmesg
2011-09-01T21:10:00.000Z	beniwtv	peragrate	yes, that would be weird
2011-09-01T21:12:00.000Z	beniwtv	peragrate	that is some very odd problem you have - I never seen any USB device not detected in dmesg
2011-09-01T21:13:00.000Z	beniwtv	peragrate	um...
