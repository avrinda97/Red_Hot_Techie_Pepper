2009-12-09T17:14:00.000Z	Krambiorix		nobody had this problem before????
2009-12-09T17:15:00.000Z	Krambiorix		damn
2009-12-09T17:15:00.000Z	Krambiorix		what a community
2009-12-09T17:17:00.000Z	Krambiorix		no just local , i opened a terminal window
2009-12-09T17:18:00.000Z	mcphail	Krambiorix	have you switched user or used sudo?
2009-12-09T17:18:00.000Z	Krambiorix	mcphail	: su -
2009-12-09T17:19:00.000Z	mcphail	Krambiorix	as root, you'd need to set DISPLAY as above. Use gksudo instead
2009-12-09T17:20:00.000Z	mcphail	Krambiorix	for anything graphical use gksudo rather than sudo
2009-12-09T17:21:00.000Z	mcphail	Krambiorix	yes, but are you using gksudo as a normal user or as root?
2009-12-09T17:22:00.000Z	Krambiorix	mcphail	: as a normal user
2009-12-09T17:25:00.000Z	mcphail	Krambiorix	if you shut the terminal and reopen then type "gedit" what happens?
2009-12-09T17:26:00.000Z	Krambiorix	mcphail	: yes now it works
2009-12-09T17:27:00.000Z	mcphail	Krambiorix	best to keep things simple!
2009-12-09T17:27:00.000Z	mcphail	Krambiorix	the "export" should have been forgotten when the terminal closed
2009-12-09T17:28:00.000Z	mcphail	Krambiorix	what is the current output of "echo $DISPLAY"?
2009-12-09T17:29:00.000Z	Krambiorix	mcphail	0.0
2009-12-09T17:29:00.000Z	Krambiorix	mcphail	:0.0
2009-12-09T17:30:00.000Z	mcphail	Krambiorix	and does "gksudo gedit" work now?
2009-12-09T17:30:00.000Z	Krambiorix	mcphail	yes
2009-12-09T17:31:00.000Z	mcphail	Krambiorix	then you are golden! Try to avoid using "su" in future
2009-12-09T17:31:00.000Z	Krambiorix	mcphail	this DISPLAY variable will be set like this in the future?
2009-12-09T17:32:00.000Z	mcphail	Krambiorix	you shouldn't need to do anything else. If you genuinely need to use "export DISPLAY=whatever" each time then you can add it to ~/.bashrc but you really shouldn't need to
