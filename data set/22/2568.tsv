2009-06-08T00:18:00.000Z	LetsGo67		What is the highest resolution for S-Video?
2009-06-08T00:19:00.000Z	fccf	LetsGo67	technically 640x480
2009-06-08T00:19:00.000Z	LetsGo67	fccf	because a TV is 480p/i?
2009-06-08T00:19:00.000Z	LetsGo67	fccf	what about an HDTV?  Same difference?
2009-06-08T00:19:00.000Z	fccf	LetsGo67	tv is 480I --- HD you can get 1080I
2009-06-08T00:20:00.000Z	fccf		** 1080p
2009-06-08T00:20:00.000Z	LetsGo67	fccf	http://bit.ly/source-svideo is this what I need to convert S-Video to RCA video?
2009-06-08T00:20:00.000Z	LetsGo67	fccf	can I use S-Video or RCA for HD or do I need the VGA cable for that?
2009-06-08T00:21:00.000Z	LetsGo67		fccf?
2009-06-08T00:22:00.000Z	fccf	LetsGo67	you can use an adaptor - really cheap on ebay... in order to have HDMI you will need to adapt from a DVI output... most newercards have this
2009-06-08T00:22:00.000Z	LetsGo67		All right, thanks.  :)
2009-06-08T00:22:00.000Z	LetsGo67		But did you see the http://bit.ly/source-svideo link?
2009-06-08T00:22:00.000Z	LetsGo67		Is this what I need to hook up my laptop to an non-HD television?
2009-06-08T00:24:00.000Z	LetsGo67		fccf?
2009-06-08T00:26:00.000Z	fccf	LetsGo67	patience bro... yes that will work ... you will need to check that you have the right connector some svideo have 4 pins some have 7 and some have 9
2009-06-08T00:27:00.000Z	LetsGo67	fccf	Mine has 7.  Who invented 4 pins and 7 pins and 9 pins?
2009-06-08T00:28:00.000Z	fccf	LetsGo67	good question ... you will need the 7 pin adaptor
2009-06-08T00:28:00.000Z	LetsGo67	fccf	the 4 pins won't work at all?
2009-06-08T00:28:00.000Z	LetsGo67		And the max resolution is 640 x 480?
2009-06-08T00:29:00.000Z	fccf	LetsGo67	not if your card has 7 pins
2009-06-08T00:29:00.000Z	LetsGo67		And can I set up my laptop screen as 1280 x 800 but the TV at 640 x 480?
2009-06-08T00:29:00.000Z	fccf	LetsGo67	 thats right
