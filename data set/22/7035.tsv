2006-06-09T15:22:00.000Z	tortho		wifi expert? Help needed to connect computer to internet. Wifi does not connect to my access point..
2006-06-09T15:22:00.000Z	cherwin	tortho	what is the problem?
2006-06-09T15:23:00.000Z	cherwin	tortho	open up a terminal and type in 'iwconfig' then you'll see what interfaces are wireless
2006-06-09T15:24:00.000Z	cherwin	tortho	then you do a 'iwconfig ethX essid <wireless_network>
2006-06-09T15:24:00.000Z	cherwin	tortho	oh yeah, don't forget to execute dhclient :)
2006-06-09T15:25:00.000Z	tortho	cherwin	I already have "Strigen Access Pont" listed as ESSID when I run iwlist... I set it under the "Network" thing...
2006-06-09T15:26:00.000Z	tortho	cherwin	no, I have allowed the MAC adr... for the card of my compiters, but have turned of WEP & WPA...
2006-06-09T15:29:00.000Z	tortho	cherwin	this means "sudo dhclient ra0" on mine.. Looks like it is just waiting, and waiting :-( DHCP is turned on and everything, my 2 other computers are working, and the problem computer is working as well, but under Windows...
2006-06-09T15:30:00.000Z	tortho	cherwin	it replyes that no dhcp offers is received.
2006-06-09T15:31:00.000Z	tortho	cherwin	192.168.132.xxx
2006-06-09T15:34:00.000Z	tortho	cherwin	i have set the computer now to 192.168.132.209, i can not ping, the TX is increasing, but RX is still at 0 so it doesn't receive any..
2006-06-09T15:34:00.000Z	tortho	cherwin	gateway and dns is set to my server 192.168.132.20 as the other computers... but it can't get any web pages either
2006-06-09T15:36:00.000Z	cherwin	tortho	thats odd, are you sure that everything is set up correctly? can you reach one of your computers if you're just connecting with utp?
2006-06-09T15:38:00.000Z	tortho	cherwin	how do i do that (udp) ? The setup on the probnlem machine is the same as the one i'm using now, when i open "system,"->Administration->Network, I then have the same config on both... except that the one i'm using now has DHCP...
2006-06-09T15:38:00.000Z	tortho	cherwin	What about wich channel it is using? can that be wrong?
2006-06-09T15:39:00.000Z	cherwin	tortho	thats up to you to choose the correct channel could you post an 'ifconfig -a' and an 'iwlist scan' please?
2006-06-09T15:40:00.000Z	tortho	cherwin	OK, i'll get a memorystick to copy the content over :-)
2006-06-09T15:48:00.000Z	tortho	cherwin	Here is both the trouble computer, and my working one.. Look at the ESSID's at the scan ?!? http://pastebin.com/770895
2006-06-09T15:50:00.000Z	cherwin	tortho	your trouble desktop doesn't see the "Strigen Access Point" so that needs to be fixed, try setting your AP at channel 6 and try it again
2006-06-09T15:51:00.000Z	tortho	cherwin	can't i set the trouble computer to 12 insted? If i set that to 6, then i guess i have to reconf the 2 other computers? In both linux & windows :-)
2006-06-09T15:53:00.000Z	cherwin	tortho	yes indeed, but if you're desktop has trouble detecting your AP you have to try this
2006-06-09T15:58:00.000Z	tortho	cherwin	thanks a lot, I'll add this usefull things to my bugreport, wich i submitted som 3-4 months ago :-) Thanks again!
