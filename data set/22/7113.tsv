2006-06-19T12:52:00.000Z	magic		Hi guys!
2006-06-19T12:53:00.000Z	magic		hey I got a little problem
2006-06-19T12:53:00.000Z	magic		my video does not look good at all.
2006-06-19T12:53:00.000Z	magic		it looks too bright
2006-06-19T12:53:00.000Z	magic		yes
2006-06-19T12:53:00.000Z	mada	magic	desktop or laptop?
2006-06-19T12:54:00.000Z	mada	magic	lcd panel or crt monitor?
2006-06-19T12:57:00.000Z	magic	mada	in windows all the videos look great.
2006-06-19T12:58:00.000Z	mada	magic	its probably a config file or just a setting ... your running ubuntu (not kubuntu or xubuntu)?
2006-06-19T12:58:00.000Z	magic	mada	actually xubuntu.
2006-06-19T12:58:00.000Z	mada	magic	ahhhh ... damn, i don't know what config tool XFCE4 offers off the top of my head, lemme check something
2006-06-19T12:59:00.000Z	magic	mada	what about if I upgrade to ubuntu desktop, can that help?
2006-06-19T13:01:00.000Z	mada	magic	like switching from xubuntu to ubuntu? ... it might, there might be some auto detection that didnt happen because you went an alternate route
2006-06-19T13:05:00.000Z	magic	mada	just wondering, if I switch to ubuntu, I can always go back to xubuntu right?
2006-06-19T13:05:00.000Z	mada	magic	sure can
2006-06-19T13:09:00.000Z	mada	magic	my g/f lives in burleson ... errr, is from there, we live together now (we both attend Sam Houston State)
2006-06-19T13:11:00.000Z	magic	mada	that's awsome, you guys are the first people I know that use linux in Texas, no one else.
2006-06-19T13:11:00.000Z	mada	magic	she doesn't but i have been a debian user for 5 years and then i just switched to ubuntu for my desktop when dapper released ... i actually have the debian swirl tattooed on me, i live for linux
2006-06-19T13:12:00.000Z	magic	mada	cool
2006-06-19T13:13:00.000Z	mada	magic	:) yeah ... i am slowly becoming lazy with linux as i get into higher level computer science courses, hence the move to ubuntu ... i just like shit to function for me
2006-06-19T13:18:00.000Z	mada	magic	yeah, ubuntu is uber easy to use for anyone which is why it has so much linux market share (so to speak) and it is still based on the power house that is debian ... w00t ;)
2006-06-19T13:19:00.000Z	magic	mada	got to go man c u later.
