2012-09-21T04:28:00.000Z	Kickball		Does anyone know how to install ubuntu with virtual box? Can they help me out/guide me though it? I am using windows, but i want to run Ubuntu on a VM, I have both the Ubuntu.iso and virtual box installed on this computer installed
2012-09-21T04:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kickball	download and MD5 test the Ubuntu ISO, make a new virtual system then mount it in virtualbox as the optical drive. Start the virtual system
2012-09-21T04:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kickball	you don't need CDs, virtualbox can handle ISO files
2012-09-21T04:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kickball	otherwise I would have said to burn a CD, but I didn't.....
2012-09-21T04:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kickball	installing virtualbox is a good first step
2012-09-21T04:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kickball	just play with the software, its not complex at all
2012-09-21T04:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kickball	there is a settings section for media, just tell it to use the ISO file
2012-09-21T04:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kickball	yes, or you won't have anywhere to install ubuntu to will you..
2012-09-21T04:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kickball	all it takes is a bit of thinknig. Think abouot what you need to do to a physical PC and use that mentality
2012-09-21T04:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kickball	its not a lot different
2012-09-21T04:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kickball	the default is fine
2012-09-21T04:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kickball	did you tell vbox to use the ISO in the cD drive?

2012-09-21T04:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kickball	there are lots of vids. The guys in #vbox can help too
