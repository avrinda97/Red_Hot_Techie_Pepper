2009-08-20T19:39:00.000Z	ojii		woah the dvd drive makes scary noises!
2009-08-20T19:40:00.000Z	ojii		it sounds as if the drive literally eats the dvd
2009-08-20T19:40:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	ojii	is the disk seated properly on the spindle?
2009-08-20T19:40:00.000Z	ojii		yes jeeves_Moss, tried a lot of different dvds/cds and they work on another pc, and I know how to insert disks
2009-08-20T19:40:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	ojii	ok, it was just a question.  is it in a tower?  or a laptop?
2009-08-20T19:41:00.000Z	ojii	jeeves_Moss	laptop...
2009-08-20T19:41:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	ojii	make/brand?
2009-08-20T19:42:00.000Z	ojii	jeeves_Moss	it just went wild so i tried to eject the disk, i pressed the drive in a bit and mplayer starts! I guess its a broken contact or whatever
2009-08-20T19:43:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	ojii	does the drive vibrate like mad?  if so, one of the rails may be loose.  my Toshiba did that.  a small jewler's screw driver fixed it
2009-08-20T19:43:00.000Z	ojii	jeeves_Moss	it sounds like its 'searching' something for about 2-5 minutes then it changes to a loud scary noise that sounds like a self-destruct mechanism
2009-08-20T19:44:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	ojii	pull it out of the laptop.  it sounds like something is loose, and it's more than likley going to cost ya to get a new one
2009-08-20T19:44:00.000Z	ojii	jeeves_Moss	can't take it out
2009-08-20T19:45:00.000Z	ojii		it is kinda loose tho jeeves_Moss
2009-08-20T19:45:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	ojii	then my friend, I think you're up a creek with lots of polycarbonate to float on
2009-08-20T19:45:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	ojii	are there screws to tighten it up?  as I said, that's what was wrong with my first Toshiba
2009-08-20T19:46:00.000Z	ojii	jeeves_Moss	there's scres but none for the rails... just for the motor/spinning bit and that one is solid
2009-08-20T19:46:00.000Z	ojii		looks like i have to bring it to the manufacturer
2009-08-20T19:47:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	ojii	DON'T screw with the laser or drive assembly.  that'll pooch it.  if the rails are physically loose on the tray, some red locktight can fix that
2009-08-20T19:48:00.000Z	ojii	jeeves_Moss	i won't screw anything unless my warranty is expired anyway, looking for it right now
2009-08-20T19:48:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	ojii	that's always the best plan
2009-08-20T19:49:00.000Z	ojii	jeeves_Moss	well at least when one knows where the warranty is...
2009-08-20T19:49:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	ojii	ok, have fun.  I've got some people to annoy/wake up
