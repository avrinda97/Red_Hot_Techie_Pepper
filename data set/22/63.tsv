2012-09-07T07:19:00.000Z	Nordom	JasonGriffee_	ahhh thx =D
2012-09-07T07:19:00.000Z	JasonGriffee_	Nordom	I would recommend using the Live CDs first to play-test them to get a feel before taking the plundge.
2012-09-07T07:19:00.000Z	Nordom		JasonGriffee: I plan too ;D
2012-09-07T07:20:00.000Z	JasonGriffee_	Nordom	That being said, if you regually back-up your files, it shoudl be non-issue.
2012-09-07T07:21:00.000Z	JasonGriffee_	Nordom	Once you get into a groove with Linux, you will find that setup is outright simple.
2012-09-07T07:22:00.000Z	Nordom		I was hoping for something more radicuntally different from windows, like how using a mac is from a windows exprience, but it looks most "_"buntus are modled after windows and macs because its familuar... and ubuntu itsell looks to smartphonish =( I probably would be best served with kubuntu... but its not different enough for mytastes XD
2012-09-07T07:22:00.000Z	Nordom		does ubuntu slow down after years of build up just like windows or does it stay pretty fast?
2012-09-07T07:23:00.000Z	JasonGriffee_	Nordom	NO
2012-09-07T07:23:00.000Z	JasonGriffee_	Nordom	You will not see the same sluggishness as with windows
2012-09-07T07:25:00.000Z	JasonGriffee_	Nordom	the sluggness is caused by windows's behind-the-sence logging of your activities
2012-09-07T07:26:00.000Z	JasonGriffee_		Linux doesn't use that junk.
2012-09-07T07:26:00.000Z	JasonGriffee_	Nordom	Linux doesn't use that junk.
2012-09-07T07:26:00.000Z	Nordom		JasonGriffee: well that and windows is pretty shit for completely deleteing something... always has remnents stuck somewhere especially if its os related crap
2012-09-07T07:28:00.000Z	JasonGriffee_	Nordom	Did you have any other questions?
2012-09-07T07:28:00.000Z	Nordom		deos ubuntu have a task bar like feature to tab through programs?
2012-09-07T07:30:00.000Z	JasonGriffee_	Nordom	Yes, and Ubuntu it'self makes it easier by letting you pin apps to it.
2012-09-07T07:30:00.000Z	Nordom		win7 does the same
2012-09-07T07:31:00.000Z	JasonGriffee_	Nordom	I know, I defected from Windows 7
2012-09-07T07:33:00.000Z	JasonGriffee_	Nordom	Is there anything else I can help you with?
2012-09-07T07:34:00.000Z	Nordom		JasonGriffee: I am probably good, next step to dl and try
2012-09-07T07:34:00.000Z	JasonGriffee_	Nordom	Ok, have a good day.
