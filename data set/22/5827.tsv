2007-04-20T09:06:00.000Z	lisapc		Feisty sits on my 2nd HDD, but Grub sits on my 1st HDD.  How can I install Grub on my 2nd HDD instead and then boot Ubuntu directly from 2nd HDD?  Anyone know pleasse?
2007-04-20T09:08:00.000Z	lisapc		<stefg> lisapc: bios boots first HD, no matter where you install grub... no way <-- yes way! LOL.  I can boot directly from my 2nd HDD
2007-04-20T09:08:00.000Z	lisapc		can anyone tell me whats the command to install Grub onto my 2nd HDD?
2007-04-20T09:09:00.000Z	Pelo	lisapc	  try asking in #grub
2007-04-20T09:09:00.000Z	lisapc	Pelo	I did ask in grub
2007-04-20T09:10:00.000Z	Pelo	lisapc	  as a general rule I beleive you need to have grub install to which ever the boot drive is,  there woudn't be much point in having it install on another drive
2007-04-20T09:11:00.000Z	lisapc	Pelo	you are dead wrong!  during POST, I press ESC and it gives me option to boot directly from first OR second hdd.  And I had edgy boot from 2nd HDD before.  So even if I took out my 1st hdd, I could still boot Ubuntu from 2nd hdd
2007-04-20T09:12:00.000Z	lisapc	Pelo	and thats a great idea in case of first hdd failure. this way I can still boot Ubuntu from 2nd hdd!  THINK before you speak ;)
2007-04-20T09:15:00.000Z	lisapc	Pelo	LOL
2007-04-20T09:15:00.000Z	Pelo	lisapc	 easy fix and it solves your problem
2007-04-20T09:15:00.000Z	lisapc	Pelo	what fix?
2007-04-20T09:15:00.000Z	lisapc	Pelo	u gave no fix
2007-04-20T09:15:00.000Z	Pelo	lisapc	 unplug the first hdd and install grub
2007-04-20T09:16:00.000Z	lisapc	Pelo	ROFL!  think before you speak man
2007-04-20T09:16:00.000Z	lisapc	Pelo	think, deeply, think
2007-04-20T09:16:00.000Z	Pelo	lisapc	 I do nothing but
2007-04-20T09:16:00.000Z	lisapc	Pelo	you think, but you dont reason the thoughts, hence the reason your words are not coherent
2007-04-20T09:34:00.000Z	lisapc	Pelo	I figured it out!  was easy.  I simply removed grub from 1st HDD, and then "sudo grub-install /dev/sdb" which installs it on my 2nd HDD.  I now dont even need the 1st HDD to load Ubuntu. :)
2007-04-20T09:35:00.000Z	lisapc	Pelo	make a note of what I did for your future refence
2007-04-20T09:37:00.000Z	lisapc	Pelo	Grub and everything is on my 2nd external HDD now
2007-04-20T09:38:00.000Z	Pelo	lisapc	  good for you,  I am in awe of your 1337ness
2007-04-20T09:38:00.000Z	lisapc	Pelo	and I am in awe of your ignorance :)
