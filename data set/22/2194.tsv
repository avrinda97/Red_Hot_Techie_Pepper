2009-08-29T01:52:00.000Z	Slart	DJNoMaD	network? basic network connectivity should work out of the box.. or you want to ask about some specific service?
2009-08-29T01:53:00.000Z	DJNoMaD	Slart	 basic does not work
2009-08-29T01:53:00.000Z	DJNoMaD		how do I change what domain my ubuntu is on ?
2009-08-29T01:53:00.000Z	Slart	DJNoMaD	the lights on the network cards light up? the network cards are recognized in both windows and ubuntu? you can set a fixed ip and ping back and forth?
2009-08-29T01:54:00.000Z	DJNoMaD		I have dchp ,but it is a lifetime lease on each machine ,would that matter if the ip's do not change ?

2009-08-29T01:55:00.000Z	Slart	DJNoMaD	ah.. you're asking about sharing files.. that would be "samba"
2009-08-29T01:55:00.000Z	Slart		!samba | DJNoMaD
2009-08-29T01:55:00.000Z	DJNoMaD		I installed a samba package

2009-08-29T01:56:00.000Z	DJNoMaD		so I need to get swat ?
2009-08-29T01:57:00.000Z	Slart	DJNoMaD	SWAT is a web-gui for setting up samba... it's just an alternative to editing the config files manually
2009-08-29T01:57:00.000Z	DJNoMaD		I get the error "cannot mount windows share"
2009-08-29T01:57:00.000Z	Slart	DJNoMaD	but read the links that ubottu gave you.. lots of good info there
2009-08-29T01:57:00.000Z	DJNoMaD	Slart	 I need to get swat then I need gui lol
