2011-09-14T22:23:00.000Z	sjonkedispe	Younder	ubuntu boots fine after a windows session
2011-09-14T22:22:00.000Z	Younder	sjonkedispe	your partions are wrong. Windows if overwriting the linux pattions
2011-09-14T22:25:00.000Z	Younder	sjonkedispe	I am almost certain this the problem
2011-09-14T22:25:00.000Z	sjonkedispe	Younder	to me it seems that a windows session actually corrects the partition, and ubuntu corrupts itself
2011-09-14T22:25:00.000Z	Younder	sjonkedispe	It is the only thing that would fail in the nature you describe
2011-09-14T22:26:00.000Z	Younder	sjonkedispe	yes, that is what I am saying
2011-09-14T22:26:00.000Z	Younder	sjonkedispe	well windows is writing to the ubuntu partion
2011-09-14T22:27:00.000Z	Younder	sjonkedispe	these OS's don't exactly see eye to eye
2011-09-14T22:28:00.000Z	sjonkedispe	Younder	ok. first ubuntu boot after a windows session is successful. second ubuntu boot attempt (i.e. directly after a successful ubuntu boot) fails, with eternal purple screen. third ubuntu boot attempt fails with short purple screen, then black with blinking cursor, then busy box with gave up waiting and your disk does not exist.
2011-09-14T22:29:00.000Z	Younder	sjonkedispe	still your partions
2011-09-14T22:29:00.000Z	sjonkedispe	Younder	i've had windows 7 and 10.04 side by side for close to a year. could a windows 7 update be the culprit?
2011-09-14T22:30:00.000Z	Younder	sjonkedispe	It might
2011-09-14T22:31:00.000Z	sjonkedispe	Younder	can i somehow correct my ubuntu partition?
2011-09-14T22:31:00.000Z	Younder	sjonkedispe	your failure mode is very strange. I don't think I have ever seen anything like it

2011-09-14T22:38:00.000Z	sjonkedispe	Younder	i've been doing dual boots since redhat 6, so i _thought_ i knew enough, but i clearly don't. bbl - reading your link. thanks for the help so far!
2011-09-14T22:40:00.000Z	Younder	sjonkedispe	Your problems have confused me too. Please give some kind of update of how things are progressing
2011-09-14T23:09:00.000Z	sjonkedispe	Younder	i've always installed windows first, then linux. do you imagine doing it the other way around would make a difference?
2011-09-14T23:10:00.000Z	Younder	sjonkedispe	It would make it more difficult, but it can be done
2011-09-14T23:11:00.000Z	sjonkedispe	Younder	i was thinking, could it have a positive impact on my "gave up waiting for root device" situation, and so forth.
2011-09-14T23:11:00.000Z	Younder	sjonkedispe	I wouldn't think so
