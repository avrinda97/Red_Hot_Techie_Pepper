2005-05-09T08:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	qweqw	A city on jupiter?
2005-05-10T16:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	qweqw	They write them, they don't control what you do with them and whether or not your include them.
2005-05-10T16:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	qweqw	POSIX and LSB are the only real standards
2005-05-10T16:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	qweqw	Being the developer means you control the direction the library or app is going.
2005-05-10T16:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	qweqw	Yeah, except Debian, it's derivitives, RedHat, and probably more...
2005-05-10T16:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	qweqw	Ubuntu
2005-05-10T16:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	qweqw	In this case, it is. Trust me, it's a bitch not knowing that you can depend on.
2005-05-10T16:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	qweqw	It doesn't define anything like that.
2005-05-10T16:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	qweqw	Read the standard.

2005-05-10T16:43:00.000Z	Amaranth	qweqw	Looks like GTK is the standard...
