2010-01-11T15:01:00.000Z	kadoban		i have php5 and libapache2-mod-php5 installed, and i've run a2enmod php5, but it still asks me to download php files when i try to navigate to them on my local apache server.  anyone know why?
2010-01-11T15:01:00.000Z	kadoban		and yes i've restarted it
2010-01-11T15:01:00.000Z	ikonia	kadoban	have you restarted apache since enabling php5
2010-01-11T15:01:00.000Z	kadoban	ikonia	yes
2010-01-11T15:02:00.000Z	ikonia	kadoban	and are you using the right extension on the php file ?
2010-01-11T15:02:00.000Z	kadoban	ikonia	.php.  i assume that's correct?
2010-01-11T15:03:00.000Z	ikonia	kadoban	sounds good
2010-01-11T15:05:00.000Z	ikonia	kadoban	if you do a sudo apache2 -l what modules are loaded ?
2010-01-11T15:06:00.000Z	ikonia	kadoban	also show me the output of "sudo dpkg -l | grep libapache2-mod-php5"

2010-01-11T15:09:00.000Z	ikonia	kadoban	look in Etcapache2/mods-enabled is the php5 files there and correctly linked to mods-available
2010-01-11T15:09:00.000Z	ikonia	kadoban	sorry - that should be /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
2010-01-11T15:10:00.000Z	kadoban	ikonia	it looks correct.  there's a .load and a .conf, neither link is broken
2010-01-11T15:11:00.000Z	ikonia	kadoban	yup, looks good, could you paste the php file's contents then ?
2010-01-11T15:11:00.000Z	ikonia	kadoban	(as in a pastebin please)

2010-01-11T15:14:00.000Z	kadoban	ikonia	oh, shit...apache gives some weird error message when it restarts.  didn't notice that before, thought it was just the usual one.  i should be able to figure it out from there
2010-01-11T15:14:00.000Z	ikonia	kadoban	that all looks simple enough
2010-01-11T15:14:00.000Z	ikonia	kadoban	control the language please
2010-01-11T15:15:00.000Z	ikonia	kadoban	do you know what the error means ?
2010-01-11T15:16:00.000Z	kadoban	ikonia	well, i should be able to figure it out.  something in the .conf.  thanks for the help
2010-01-11T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	kadoban	no problem, well spotted
