2009-10-12T11:52:00.000Z	melow01		Since my laptop doesn't have a mouse wheel button, is there a different way to paste text into terminal?
2009-10-12T11:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	melow01	shift + insert
2009-10-12T11:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	melow01	what do you want it to do?
2009-10-12T11:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	melow01	well you asked for an equivelant, what is it an equivelant to?
2009-10-12T11:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	melow01	please use tab to complete my nick
2009-10-12T11:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	melow01	and you didnt answer my question, WHAT do yu want an equivelant to?
2009-10-12T11:56:00.000Z	melow01	ActionParsnip1	sweet
2009-10-12T11:57:00.000Z	melow01	ActionParsnip1	I'm wondering what the Linux equivalent would be to 'ctrl+alt+del'?
2009-10-12T11:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	melow01	yes you said that. I have NO idea what you want the keypress to do
2009-10-12T11:57:00.000Z	melow01	ActionParsnip1	ok, not a big deal
2009-10-12T11:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	melow01	thats why i ask, what is it an equivelant to?. When you press it what will it do, load gedit?
2009-10-12T11:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	melow01	i dont know what you expect ctrl+alt+del so i am asking so we can proceed
2009-10-12T11:58:00.000Z	melow01	ActionParsnip1	I understand now... mainly, I'm looking for a process killer/task manager
2009-10-12T11:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	melow01	ok great, THTS why I was after
2009-10-12T11:59:00.000Z	melow01	ActionParsnip1	I heard you can you do it in terminal a lot easier but too familiar with the cmd yet
2009-10-12T11:59:00.000Z	melow01	ActionParsnip1	*not too familiar
2009-10-12T11:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	melow01	you can run xkill and click the app to die
2009-10-12T12:00:00.000Z	melow01	ActionParsnip1	i run xkill in terminal?
2009-10-12T12:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	melow01	sure, or if you press alt-f2 you can launch it there
2009-10-12T12:01:00.000Z	melow01	ActionParsnip1	ok, kool
2009-10-12T12:01:00.000Z	melow01	ActionParsnip1	thanks
2009-10-12T12:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	melow01	there are 2 ommands to run which will enable ctrl+alt+del to bring up gnome system monitor: http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/ubuntu-help/74391-ctrl-alt-delete.html
