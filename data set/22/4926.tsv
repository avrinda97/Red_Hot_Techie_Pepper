2007-09-09T10:59:00.000Z	professorsnapper		When doing a software update, I get a warning saying that the updates "can't be authenticated", and pose a possible security risk. Should I be concerned about this? How can I get authenticated updates for Feisty?
2007-09-09T11:00:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	for which packages you get the warning?
2007-09-09T11:01:00.000Z	professorsnapper	kostkon	about 50 of them - ranging from python 2.5 thru firefox, etc etc...
2007-09-09T11:07:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	strange. If you go to "System -> Adiminstration -> Software Sources" and see at the "Authentication" tab if you have the key for the ubuntu repositories
2007-09-09T11:10:00.000Z	professorsnapper	kostkon	thanks for the reply. Seems I have two keys - one is the Ubuntu Archive Automatic Signing Key, the 2nd is the Ubuntu CD image Auto signing key.
2007-09-09T11:12:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	hmm, it's an option. I haven't tried it myself but you can do it I guess. But it seems that you have the keys needed.
2007-09-09T11:17:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	what happens? why you can't close it?
2007-09-09T11:22:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	is the manager still running. Nevertheless, to fix the warnings try to do a "sudo apt-get update" from the terminal. Maybe you had a problem getting all the info from the repositories
2007-09-09T11:26:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	yeah, maybe the repository is down. Do you use a local repository?
2007-09-09T11:29:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	do you get the fail message for all of the urls?
2007-09-09T11:35:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	hmm. it looks like there is a problem getting the packages list from your repositories. It looks like a connection problem or a repository server is down. Does your repositories urls have a country prefix in front of them?
2007-09-09T11:37:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	for the urls that you get the "failed to fetch" you could add your local prefix in front of it to see if it will work better.
2007-09-09T11:38:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	, for which of them you get the "failed to fetch"?
2007-09-09T11:40:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	I assume yes. You can edit your sources list from a text editor, it would more easy and fast. Just do a "sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" from the terminal. When you finish do again the "sudo apt-get update".
2007-09-09T11:57:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	first close any apt frontend like synaptic or update manager to be sure. Did you use "sudo" in front of the command?
2007-09-09T12:01:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	yeah strange. You should be able to edit it and save it without any problem.
2007-09-09T12:03:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	yeah, but don't know any specifics, sorry.
2007-09-09T12:07:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	how do you connect to the internet? Do you use a proxy or something like that?
2007-09-09T12:11:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	ok
2007-09-09T12:22:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	ok, no prob!! I hope now you will be OK. Try it and tell me. Do a "sudo apt-get update".
2007-09-09T12:49:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	no prob! Happy that you managed to solve the problem!
2007-09-09T12:52:00.000Z	kostkon	professorsnapper	no joke! You gained more experience with Ubuntu!
