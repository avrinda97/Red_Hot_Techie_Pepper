2008-06-20T18:22:00.000Z	element		anybody know why when i play youtube, the rhytbox crash?
2008-06-20T18:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	element	because youtube uses flash, and flash sucks and is broken
2008-06-20T18:23:00.000Z	element	gordonjcp	and how can i fix it
2008-06-20T18:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	element	close rhythmbox before going to youtube
2008-06-20T18:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	element	and pester Adobe to bring flash kicking and screaming into the 21st century
2008-06-20T18:24:00.000Z	element		i wasnt open the rhythmbox after play youtube
2008-06-20T18:24:00.000Z	element	gordonjcp	i was watching youtube only, then i close youtube and when i opened the rhythmbox ...i cant play the music
2008-06-20T18:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	element	close firefox completely, it still has grabbed the soundcard
2008-06-20T18:25:00.000Z	element	gordonjcp	ok let me try
2008-06-20T18:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	element	Flash uses an old way of dealing with sound that makes it insist on being the only thing using the card
2008-06-20T18:25:00.000Z	element	gordonjcp	but that really sux
2008-06-20T18:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	element	that's flash for you
2008-06-20T18:26:00.000Z	element	gordonjcp	lol, theres a way to fix it?
2008-06-20T18:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	element	pester Adobe to bring flash up to date, and not use an API that's been dead for ten years
2008-06-20T18:27:00.000Z	element	gordonjcp	thx im playing music right now
2008-06-20T18:28:00.000Z	gordonjcp	element	cool
2008-06-20T18:28:00.000Z	gordonjcp	element	it's a PITA but that's how things are right now...
2008-06-20T18:28:00.000Z	element	gordonjcp	but..i dont understand who can i fix it
2008-06-20T18:28:00.000Z	element	gordonjcp	 i wanna play youtube and i wanna play music at the same time
2008-06-20T18:29:00.000Z	gordonjcp	element	only Adobe can fix it, unless someone writes a thing that somehow intercepts Flash's attempt to grab sound
2008-06-20T18:29:00.000Z	element	gordonjcp	lets kill the adobe programers lol
