2006-05-27T07:31:00.000Z	Malikith	bla|patrick	I got the drivers to compile, did you read the readme and instructions on how to compile these, and did you install gcc and g++ onto your machine so you are able to compile?

2006-05-27T07:32:00.000Z	Malikith	bla|patrick	Ahh I see, so you're on a machine elsewhere, okay, i'll package these for you then, I won't be able to package these into a dpkg because of the way these things want to install but you won't need any compiling tools now since i've already done it.
