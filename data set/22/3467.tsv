2008-08-25T15:06:00.000Z	icedwater	adimov_	check in your fstab?
2008-08-25T15:08:00.000Z	icedwater	adimov_	look in a terminal, enter "cat /etc/fstab" - that'll give you a list of the partitions that will be mounted automatically
2008-08-25T15:16:00.000Z	adimov_	icedwater	i have sda1 ext3, sda5 swap, scd0, scd1 - that's all
2008-08-25T15:18:00.000Z	icedwater	adimov_	OK... where is your windows partition? Try checking "ls /dev/sda*"
2008-08-25T15:20:00.000Z	icedwater	adimov_	I believe someone suggested "sudo fdisk -l" earlier. Try that? It should confirm that your /dev/sda2 is the Windows partition.
2008-08-25T15:24:00.000Z	icedwater	adimov_	check out www.pastebin.com :)
2008-08-25T15:26:00.000Z	icedwater	adimov_	do you have the Ubuntu live CD?
2008-08-25T15:29:00.000Z	icedwater	adimov_	I see, you downloaded the alternate install disc image? What did you do when you upgraded to 8.04?
2008-08-25T15:32:00.000Z	icedwater	adimov_	so you
2008-08-25T15:32:00.000Z	icedwater	adimov_	so you're saying you downloaded all the packages and began to install stuff... and you had to stop halfway? Then you reinstalled 7.10 using a CD after that, I guess?
2008-08-25T15:34:00.000Z	icedwater	adimov_	I guess then it must have been something you did with 7.10 - try to recall what you did when you installed that?
2008-08-25T15:37:00.000Z	icedwater	adimov_	I think that might have been it, then, you could have erased your Windows partition.
2008-08-25T15:43:00.000Z	icedwater	adimov_	too bad about the Windows stuff... sorry it took so long to find you an answer :P
2008-08-25T15:44:00.000Z	icedwater	adimov_	you will probably have to reinstall everything from scratch. Windows's bootloader is known to be nasty to other bootloaders.. after you install Windows, you won't be able to boot Ubuntu I think. Not sure how to get around that.
2008-08-25T15:51:00.000Z	adimov_	icedwater	what is with all that upgrade stuff in the right upper corner?
2008-08-25T15:54:00.000Z	icedwater	adimov_	what upgrade stuff where? What are you running now?
2008-08-25T15:57:00.000Z	adimov_	icedwater	i am on 7.10
