2009-09-29T03:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	depe	did you get the torrent off the ubuntu.com site?
2009-09-29T03:40:00.000Z	Scunizi	depe	and you opened the torrent with transmission and nothing is happening?
2009-09-29T03:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	depe	I thought you said you got the torrent from ubuntu.com? now your saying you got it from linux23.com..
2009-09-29T03:42:00.000Z	Scunizi	depe	might be a bad torrent.. I've used the one off the ubuntu site and download time was about 15 minutes.. pretty quick.. you might have an ISP that chokes torrents.. it's been known to happen.. are you in the U.S. or where in the world?
