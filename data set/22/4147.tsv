2008-03-08T10:59:00.000Z	J-Unit		cd /folding
2008-03-08T10:59:00.000Z	J-Unit		wget http://www.stanford.edu/group/pandegroup/release/FAH502-Linux.exe
2008-03-08T10:59:00.000Z	J-Unit		chmod +x FAH502-Linux.exe
2008-03-08T11:00:00.000Z	Dangermike	J-Unit	if its a windows executable run wine FAH502-Linux.exe
2008-03-08T11:02:00.000Z	Dangermike	J-Unit	if it still gives you a problem chmod a+x FAH502-Linux.exe  i was able to extract the content and get in the installer that way
2008-03-08T11:05:00.000Z	Dangermike	J-Unit	go to places then Desktop
2008-03-08T11:06:00.000Z	Dangermike	J-Unit	in what directory did you execute wget
2008-03-08T11:07:00.000Z	J-Unit	Dangermike	execute wget?
2008-03-08T11:07:00.000Z	Dangermike	J-Unit	Double click the folder on the desktop -_-'
2008-03-08T11:08:00.000Z	J-Unit	Dangermike	i tried double clicking it, as well as right clicking and selecting open in another way or wtv and typed wineconsole none of that worked
2008-03-08T11:18:00.000Z	Dangermike	J-Unit	that is really offtopic the wikipedia article should explain how proxy servers work ;)
2008-03-08T11:20:00.000Z	J-Unit	Dangermike	well all i needed to no was that it was transfer from sumtin to sumtin, i was hoping for a sentence definition instead i got pages lol
2008-03-08T11:21:00.000Z	Dangermike	J-Unit	the answer for you would be no
2008-03-08T11:22:00.000Z	Dangermike	J-Unit	the fact you dont know what a proxy is means its a no you would know if your using one
2008-03-08T11:23:00.000Z	J-Unit	Dangermike	k. thx
2008-03-08T11:26:00.000Z	Dangermike	J-Unit	it depends on where folding@home installed to
2008-03-08T11:29:00.000Z	Dangermike	J-Unit	that package isnt supported by ubuntu it would be best if you were familiar with the documentation for folding@home
2008-03-08T11:30:00.000Z	J-Unit	Dangermike	wat package isnt supported by ubuntu? folding@home?
2008-03-08T11:32:00.000Z	Dangermike	J-Unit	that just means that you cant always expect absolute answers for folding@home unless someone has been using it or somebody is kind enough to read the documentation
2008-03-08T11:32:00.000Z	Dangermike	J-Unit	here at least they have their own support channels
2008-03-08T11:34:00.000Z	Dangermike	J-Unit	also that file should probably only be used to (re)install
