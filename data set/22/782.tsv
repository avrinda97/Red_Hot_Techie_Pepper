2011-05-16T02:09:00.000Z	vectory_	monaDeveloper	do you have a ssh server running?
2011-05-16T02:09:00.000Z	monaDeveloper	vectory_	I'm not sure
2011-05-16T02:09:00.000Z	monaDeveloper	vectory_	let me see
2011-05-16T02:09:00.000Z	vectory_	monaDeveloper	ps aux|grep ssh
2011-05-16T02:10:00.000Z	vectory_	monaDeveloper	ps aux|grep sshd, maybe
2011-05-16T02:10:00.000Z	monaDeveloper	vectory_	yeah it's
2011-05-16T02:11:00.000Z	vectory_	monaDeveloper	it is what?
2011-05-16T02:11:00.000Z	vectory_		sshd is runnning?
2011-05-16T02:11:00.000Z	vectory_	monaDeveloper	make sure grep doesnt return just "grep sshd"
2011-05-16T02:11:00.000Z	vectory_		because thats just the line for the grep programm, it finds itself :)
2011-05-16T02:12:00.000Z	monaDeveloper	vectory_	yeah I understand
2011-05-16T02:12:00.000Z	monaDeveloper	vectory_	I stopped ssh
2011-05-16T02:13:00.000Z	vectory_	monaDeveloper	ssh is not a ssh server
2011-05-16T02:13:00.000Z	vectory_		:/
