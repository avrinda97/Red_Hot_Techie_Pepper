2005-04-20T12:45:00.000Z	wjesusaxl		hey you guys ... do you know.. how to start a whole network...
2005-04-20T12:46:00.000Z	bob2	wjesusaxl	it sounds like you should start off reading something like the basic network concepts howto on tldp.org
2005-05-05T07:38:00.000Z	bob2	wjesusaxl	you don't need to keep asking
2005-05-05T07:38:00.000Z	bob2	wjesusaxl	once is plenty
2005-05-05T07:39:00.000Z	bob2	wjesusaxl	did you install portmap? search the ubuntu website? etc.
2005-05-05T07:41:00.000Z	wjesusaxl	bob2	I did it already
2005-05-05T07:41:00.000Z	bob2	wjesusaxl	you read the documentation on ubuntu.com?
2005-05-05T07:42:00.000Z	wjesusaxl	bob2	I got some problem with the permissions
2005-05-05T07:43:00.000Z	bob2	wjesusaxl	but you're not going to tell us what that problem is?
2005-05-05T07:46:00.000Z	wjesusaxl	bob2	hey.. there might be someone who had the same problem once and got a tip.. so why don't you just stop writing and let someone else help me out
2005-05-05T07:47:00.000Z	bob2	wjesusaxl	why don't you tell us the actual problem
2005-05-05T07:47:00.000Z	bob2	wjesusaxl	instead of alluding to a "permission problem"
2005-08-29T09:54:00.000Z	bob2	wjesusaxl	where did you get your kaffe package from?
2005-08-29T09:55:00.000Z	wjesusaxl	bob2	I don't remember I downloaded it
2005-08-29T09:55:00.000Z	bob2	wjesusaxl	you need to find out
2005-08-29T09:57:00.000Z	wjesusaxl	bob2	it came along with the java package I downloaded years ago
2005-08-29T09:58:00.000Z	bob2	wjesusaxl	so, show us that in #flood then
2005-08-29T09:58:00.000Z	wjesusaxl	bob2	show you my "sources.list"
2005-08-29T10:03:00.000Z	bob2	wjesusaxl	that's presumably missing all the other oens ytou added
2005-08-29T10:06:00.000Z	wjesusaxl	bob2	can't understand what you say
2005-08-29T10:06:00.000Z	bob2	wjesusaxl	nevermind then
