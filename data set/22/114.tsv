2012-07-05T12:39:00.000Z	Cop		I wonder if there's a special version of windows 7 nice and light weight that I can dedicated to my VM.
2012-07-05T12:39:00.000Z	Cop		Gah!
2012-07-05T12:39:00.000Z	Cop		I'm on a laptop 4GB ram.. Dual core processor only..
2012-07-05T12:40:00.000Z	Cop		Might be a resource hog to install the normal version.
2012-07-05T12:40:00.000Z	Cop		You guys agree?
2012-07-05T12:41:00.000Z	Cop		You know what I hate about gnome-shell is the lack of tilling.
2012-07-05T12:41:00.000Z	Cop		xMonad + Arch Linux.
2012-07-05T12:41:00.000Z	Cop		Dream.

2012-07-05T12:43:00.000Z	ghostchick	Cop	kde /unity and gnome have both tiling
2012-07-05T12:44:00.000Z	Cop	ghostchick	Not by default?
2012-07-05T12:44:00.000Z	Cop		I found this extension called shell-shape (http://vimeo.com/25589480)
2012-07-05T12:45:00.000Z	Cop	ghostchick	looks good but I have no info on it.
2012-07-05T12:45:00.000Z	ghostchick	Cop	oh it works i tried it
2012-07-05T12:46:00.000Z	Cop	ghostchick	Really? How would you rate it out of 10?
2012-07-05T12:46:00.000Z	ghostchick		7,5
2012-07-05T12:46:00.000Z	Cop	ghostchick	are they any others that you've tried and prefer over it?
2012-07-05T12:47:00.000Z	ghostchick	Cop	 for gnome shell it is the only developed extension for complete tiling
2012-07-05T12:47:00.000Z	ghostchick	Cop	the tiling in kde is more elaborated though
2012-07-05T12:48:00.000Z	Cop	ghostchick	Not a KDE user.
2012-07-05T12:48:00.000Z	Cop	ghostchick	Not a KDE user.
