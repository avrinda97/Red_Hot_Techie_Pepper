2005-01-10T08:37:00.000Z	odyssey		Hi i am wondering why libvorbis0a has an a on the end of its name? This is a problem for me as i am unable to install a .deb which has the dependency of libvorbis0. Please can someone help?
2005-01-10T08:38:00.000Z	Kamion	odyssey	the ABI got changed and therefore the soname had to change. Get whoever provided the .deb to rebuild it against a vaguely current system.
2005-01-10T08:38:00.000Z	Kamion	odyssey	(or rebuild it yourself, assuming you have source)
2005-01-10T08:39:00.000Z	odyssey	Kamion	coming from a rpm distro is it possible to remove libvorbis0a with a nodeps flag?
2005-01-10T08:39:00.000Z	Kamion	odyssey	nodeps is EVIL AND BAD AND WRONG
2005-01-10T08:39:00.000Z	Kamion	odyssey	(no, it will break things)
2005-01-10T08:40:00.000Z	Kamion		rpm's casual tolerance of nodeps is one of its worst features. you can do it with dpkg, but apt will complain.
2005-01-10T08:40:00.000Z	Kamion		and in this case it probably won't work either
2005-01-10T08:40:00.000Z	Kamion		s/either/anyway/
2005-01-10T08:40:00.000Z	odyssey		but if i then install libvorbis0 it wouldnt break things, would it?
2005-01-10T08:41:00.000Z	Kamion		the libvorbis0a transition is one that you just have to swallow. really, get the maintainer of the package in question to rebuild it, it's the easiest way
2005-01-10T08:41:00.000Z	odyssey	Kamion	ok thank you
2005-01-10T08:42:00.000Z	Kamion		if it were possible to install libvorbis0 then you would be able to do so without needing to force dependency breakage along the way
2005-01-10T08:44:00.000Z	odyssey		it is possible its just that i have libvorbis0a installed at the moment
2005-01-10T08:50:00.000Z	Kamion	odyssey	libvorbis0 died ages ago; no Debian-descended distribution since Debian 3.0 has it
2005-01-10T08:51:00.000Z	Kamion	odyssey	where's this package, anyway?
2005-01-10T08:54:00.000Z	odyssey	Kamion	i want to install libavcodec which requires it
2005-01-10T08:56:00.000Z	Kamion	odyssey	the version of libavcodec2 in Ubuntu multiverse depends on libvorbis0a
2005-01-10T08:57:00.000Z	Kamion		I'm pretty sure there are other builds out there for Debian sarge which depend on libvorbis0a too
2005-01-10T08:59:00.000Z	odyssey	Kamion	is that in the hoary repo?
2005-01-10T08:59:00.000Z	Kamion	odyssey	either warty or hoary
2005-01-10T09:00:00.000Z	odyssey	Kamion	arrr i see it thank you
