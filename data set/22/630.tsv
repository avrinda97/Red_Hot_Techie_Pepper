2011-06-10T02:43:00.000Z	rationalOgre	amingri	how are you connecting the windows and ubuntu computers? Crossover cable? Second router?
2011-06-10T02:43:00.000Z	amingri	rationalOgre	just LAN cable
2011-06-10T02:44:00.000Z	rationalOgre	amingri	And it actually lets it ping one another? I thought you couldn't do that without a crossover cable.
2011-06-10T02:44:00.000Z	amingri	rationalOgre	yes, they ping each other, but no internet on ubuntu machine
2011-06-10T02:45:00.000Z	rationalOgre	amingri	Ok, well, regardless, did you set up internet connection sharing on the windows computer?
2011-06-10T02:48:00.000Z	amingri	rationalOgre	i tried. there is a message "internet connection sharing cannot be enabled... LAN is already configured"
2011-06-10T02:48:00.000Z	rationalOgre	amingri	Do you have a static ip set for the windows box?
2011-06-10T02:49:00.000Z	amingri	rationalOgre	yes, i tried automatic as well. no progress with that...
2011-06-10T02:50:00.000Z	rationalOgre	amingri	You need to unplug the ethernet cable, set up a static IP for the ethernet nic, enable internet connection sharing, then plug it back in.
2011-06-10T02:50:00.000Z	amingri	rationalOgre	ok, ill try
2011-06-10T02:50:00.000Z	rationalOgre	amingri	Then you need a static Ip set for the ubuntu box
2011-06-10T02:51:00.000Z	rationalOgre	amingri	You do that with sudo ifconfig eth0 <IP-U-WANT> netmask <SAME-NETMASK-AS-WIN-BOX>
2011-06-10T02:52:00.000Z	amingri	rationalOgre	prv msg
2011-06-10T02:54:00.000Z	rationalOgre	amingri	That looks right, though you might want to nix the DNS route as I don't know if that will work, it might, just not sure.
2011-06-10T02:54:00.000Z	rationalOgre	amingri	Sorry, DNS route on the ubuntu box
2011-06-10T02:55:00.000Z	rationalOgre	amingri	You might need to have it get it's dns stuff from the windows box
2011-06-10T02:58:00.000Z	rationalOgre	amingri	like julie said, edit /etc/resolv.conf and add/replace the nameserver line with 192.168.0.1 (if that doesnt work try 192.168.1.15)
2011-06-10T03:00:00.000Z	rationalOgre	amingri	if you find these settings work you can also edit /etc/network/interfaces and set up the address, netmask and gateway lines there
2011-06-10T03:02:00.000Z	amingri	rationalOgre	this is messing in files, i dont like this solution :) i prefer numbers changing and buttons clicking :P there was internet on ubuntu for some time, but disappeared. i didnt have to change any files.
2011-06-10T03:02:00.000Z	rationalOgre	amingri	Sorry, when twiddling knobs and clicking buttons fails, changing files works.
2011-06-10T03:04:00.000Z	amingri	rationalOgre	ok, ill try. ty :)
2011-06-10T03:04:00.000Z	rationalOgre	amingri	Did you get ICS setup?
