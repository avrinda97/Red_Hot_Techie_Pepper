2012-07-28T10:38:00.000Z	WHAT_UP		Weird bug: sound only seems to work in my video players about 1 in 3 times that i open them (the same file seems to decide to play sound or not nondeterministically). What gives?
2012-07-28T10:38:00.000Z	WHAT_UP		the above holds for both vlc and totem or whatever the builtin player is called these days
2012-07-28T10:39:00.000Z	WHAT_UP		vlc doesn't even seem to recognize that there's an audio track most of the time
2012-07-28T10:41:00.000Z	WhatWhereAmI	WHAT_UP	does this happen when you use vlc to play an audio file, an mp3 for example?
2012-07-28T10:44:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	WhatWhereAmI	hmm. the video issue doesn't seem to work for videos on another hard drive. could it be that because i'm writing to the first drive, reading isn't going fast enough to handle sound as well? i'm looking for an mp3 now to test what happens if i run that from the written-to drive
2012-07-28T10:44:00.000Z	WhatWhereAmI	WHAT_UP	that sounds weird!
2012-07-28T10:45:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	WhatWhereAmI	i get a lot of "main subpicture error: blending YUVA to I411 failed" errors in the terminal from vlc. googling it doesn't help much.
2012-07-28T10:45:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	WhatWhereAmI	mp3 works fine
2012-07-28T10:46:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	WhatWhereAmI	i guess it could be, but i never had this problem before. the video is from a single source, but it's kind of shady (video camera writing to a hard drive that might not be able to handle the load at times, but generally seems fine)
2012-07-28T10:46:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	WhatWhereAmI	i know the audio track is there, because it does seem to load *part* of the time for each individual video
2012-07-28T10:47:00.000Z	WhatWhereAmI	WHAT_UP	wait, is the file currently being written?
2012-07-28T10:47:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	WhatWhereAmI	unless over 10 files are being copied in parallel, the answer should be no to at least some of them
2012-07-28T10:48:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	WhatWhereAmI	hmm
2012-07-28T10:48:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	WhatWhereAmI	yes. let me try it.
2012-07-28T10:49:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	WhatWhereAmI	yes. and it seems to work there without fault
2012-07-28T10:50:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	WhatWhereAmI	http://pastie.org/4347048
2012-07-28T10:52:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	WhatWhereAmI	one of them might be silent
2012-07-28T10:52:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	WhatWhereAmI	problem is, vlc doesn't even let me choose between the two. the entire audio selection is greyed out
2012-07-28T10:54:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	WhatWhereAmI	is there a way to skip forward... in-veo :P
2012-07-28T10:55:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	WhatWhereAmI	oh. arrow keys. nice! this will work just fine for my current needs. thanks!!
2012-07-28T10:56:00.000Z	WhatWhereAmI	WHAT_UP	also f for fullscreen
2012-07-28T10:59:00.000Z	WHAT_UP	WhatWhereAmI	not needed for my case :P. i need to identify some basic info about the videos (lecture title, speaker, affiliation, etc) so i can put in the metadata into a database so my script can (hopefully) process them =). small-size is good enough for this. mplayer seems like a clean player for future purposes, though, so thanks!
