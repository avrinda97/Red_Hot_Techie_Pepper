2007-11-24T04:19:00.000Z	FireAllianceNX		is there a way to change the screen resolution of your terminal screen? (like tty1)
2007-11-24T04:20:00.000Z	bruenig	FireAllianceNX	the tty's are actually a program called agetty
2007-11-24T04:20:00.000Z	bruenig	FireAllianceNX	so you would want to man agetty and see how it deals with resolution and size and whatnot and then edit /etc/inittab's agetty commands
2007-11-24T04:24:00.000Z	FireAllianceNX	bruenig	Nothing in man pages
2007-11-24T04:25:00.000Z	bruenig	FireAllianceNX	well looking at my /etc/inittab, I see that it runs /sbin/agetty 38400, I have to imagine that the 38400 thing deals with something like that
2007-11-24T04:26:00.000Z	FireAllianceNX	bruenig	I do not actually have a file named inittab
2007-11-24T04:26:00.000Z	FireAllianceNX	bruenig	That's probably the baud rate
2007-11-24T04:26:00.000Z	bruenig	FireAllianceNX	do "test -f /etc/inittab ; echo $?"
2007-11-24T04:27:00.000Z	bruenig	FireAllianceNX	hmm well bad advice on my part then, not sure what controls that, might be the framebuffer? might be able to control it with grub
2007-11-24T04:28:00.000Z	bruenig	FireAllianceNX	you got a 1, ok then /etc/inittab doesn't exist. That's kind of odd but ok. What resolution do you want?
2007-11-24T04:29:00.000Z	FireAllianceNX	bruenig	Oh is it a 1? lol... anything with bigger dpi because the fonts are hard to read.
2007-11-24T04:29:00.000Z	bruenig	FireAllianceNX	yeah it should have been a 0 or 1, 0 for exist, 1 for doesn't exist, but what resolution do you want
2007-11-24T04:31:00.000Z	FireAllianceNX	bruenig	if it could be 1024x18??, it would be amazing.
2007-11-24T04:31:00.000Z	bruenig	FireAllianceNX	I assume that was a typo? 1024x18?
2007-11-24T04:31:00.000Z	FireAllianceNX	bruenig	uhhh 1280x1024
2007-11-24T04:32:00.000Z	bruenig	FireAllianceNX	ok edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and on the line that says kernel put a space after whatever is already on that line and add this: vga=775
2007-11-24T04:33:00.000Z	bruenig	FireAllianceNX	that will change the framebuffer to that resolution, I imagine that the tty's inherit the framebuffers resolution but maybe not, just a thought
2007-11-24T04:33:00.000Z	FireAllianceNX	bruenig	I'll try that, thanks
2007-11-24T04:33:00.000Z	bruenig	FireAllianceNX	yeah reboot to see
2007-11-24T04:44:00.000Z	FireAllianceNX	bruenig	Now the terminal won't even come up lol Stuck with a blinking cursor. I'll just deal with the weird font size.
2007-11-24T04:45:00.000Z	bruenig	FireAllianceNX	there might be another way, just a stab really on my part.
2007-11-24T04:45:00.000Z	FireAllianceNX	bruenig	No worries, thanks anyway!! :)
