2006-06-01T15:39:00.000Z	nbx909		lol
2006-06-01T15:39:00.000Z	nbx909		this is on a friends computer
2006-06-01T15:39:00.000Z	eobanb	nbx909	what sort of mouse
2006-06-01T15:39:00.000Z	nbx909	eobanb	seems like something that should work
2006-06-01T15:40:00.000Z	eobanb	nbx909	have you tried any other mice?
2006-06-01T15:41:00.000Z	nbx909	eobanb	no i guess that would be a good idea lol
2006-06-01T15:41:00.000Z	nbx909	eobanb	but he will want to use this mouse evetually
2006-06-01T15:41:00.000Z	eobanb	nbx909	that's fine, but just see if other USB or PS/2 mice work first
2006-06-01T15:41:00.000Z	eobanb	nbx909	do other USB peripherals work?
2006-06-01T15:42:00.000Z	nbx909	eobanb	no idea let me see
2006-06-01T15:45:00.000Z	nbx909	eobanb	he figured it out, he didn't have power going to the hub that he uses ><
2006-06-01T15:46:00.000Z	eobanb	nbx909	it's never a good idea to plug a usb mouse into a usb hub
2006-06-01T15:46:00.000Z	nbx909	eobanb	why not?
2006-06-01T15:51:00.000Z	eobanb	nbx909	actually i think for some reason there is a metapackage
2006-06-01T15:51:00.000Z	nbx909	eobanb	really? i could not find it for the wor;d
2006-06-01T15:53:00.000Z	eobanb	nbx909	support tickets are organised, but not very fast.
2006-06-01T15:54:00.000Z	eobanb	nbx909	it's only truly crazy on rare days like this when there are 1000+ users in the channel.
2006-06-01T15:54:00.000Z	nbx909	eobanb	true but there is an ircd that has a bot that will only voice a few people at a time so that it doesn't get crazy
2006-06-01T15:54:00.000Z	eobanb	nbx909	then users wouldn't be able to ask/answer questions when they needed to.
2006-06-01T15:54:00.000Z	nbx909	eobanb	once one person's problem is "solved" they are devoiced
2006-06-01T15:55:00.000Z	nbx909	eobanb	they message chanserv with a flag to be put in line
