2008-02-18T03:17:00.000Z	yacc		Any idea how to extract the necessary files for ndiswrapper when the NetGear WN111 comes only with an EXE file?
2008-02-18T03:17:00.000Z	usr13	yacc	unzip filename.exe
2008-02-18T03:17:00.000Z	yacc	usr13	sure?
2008-02-18T03:17:00.000Z	usr13	yacc	Yes
2008-02-18T03:18:00.000Z	yacc	usr13	When run on Vista, it gives a full installer, ...
2008-02-18T03:18:00.000Z	usr13	yacc	Extract the files.
2008-02-18T03:18:00.000Z	yacc	usr13	After running that stupid installer, I got no INF file either, just a WN111.EXE ;(
2008-02-18T03:19:00.000Z	usr13	yacc	unzip WN111.EXE
2008-02-18T03:21:00.000Z	usr13	yacc	file WN111.EXE
2008-02-18T03:24:00.000Z	yacc	usr13	I'm not on that box, but file did report a PE executable. When run on Vista it seemed to have no effect, perhaps because the USB device was not present on the Vista box.
2008-02-18T03:25:00.000Z	usr13	yacc	Then you have the wrong file.
2008-02-18T03:25:00.000Z	usr13	yacc	Try downloading drivers for XP system. or win98 system.
2008-02-18T03:27:00.000Z	yacc	usr13	netgear is so nice to offer no drivers for download for that stick ;)
2008-02-18T03:28:00.000Z	usr13	yacc	Is this a PCI device?
2008-02-18T03:28:00.000Z	yacc	usr13	USB stick.
2008-02-18T03:29:00.000Z	usr13	yacc	Oh, well, I don't know about those things.... May not be able to get it to work.
2008-02-18T03:29:00.000Z	usr13	yacc	Is this a laptop?
2008-02-18T03:29:00.000Z	yacc	usr13	Officially only supported on Vista.
2008-02-18T03:29:00.000Z	yacc	usr13	nope, a desktop box.
2008-02-18T03:30:00.000Z	usr13	yacc	Get a PCI card.  Or an ethernet bridge.
2008-02-18T03:31:00.000Z	yacc	usr13	that costs money. That's a "Vista-upgrader" that is frustrated by Vista. So telling him to replace half his hardware is a no-go ;(
2008-02-18T03:31:00.000Z	yacc	usr13	And I have already an "Unsupported" on his nice Scanner, which is not nice ;(
