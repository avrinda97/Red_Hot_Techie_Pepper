2012-10-09T05:00:00.000Z	grumbly		Is it possible to mount a directory on a NAS and make it persistent?
2012-10-09T05:00:00.000Z	grumbly		persistent being It comes back on its own after rebooting
2012-10-09T05:01:00.000Z	farrioth	grumbly	After rebooting the NAS or the system it's mounted on?
2012-10-09T05:01:00.000Z	grumbly	farrioth	both... either...
2012-10-09T05:03:00.000Z	farrioth	grumbly	fstab if the system it's mounted on is rebooted.  For the other way round... you could run an ssh server on the system where the directory is mounted and get the NAS to ssh in and mount itself on boot.
2012-10-09T05:04:00.000Z	grumbly	farrioth	I don't need to move files from the nas back... why would I have the NAS ssh in?
2012-10-09T05:05:00.000Z	farrioth	grumbly	So it can mount itself once it comes back online.  The other option to to poll (on the client) to see when it goes down and then to see when it comes back up and then mount it.
2012-10-09T05:07:00.000Z	grumbly	farrioth	OH YOU GENIUS!!! the NAS is a storebought one, so I don't know if I can do the SSH login... which would be pretty cool...  could you explain the other idea more and how I would go about ths?
2012-10-09T05:09:00.000Z	farrioth	grumbly	Can you log in to the NAS over ssh at the moment?
2012-10-09T05:10:00.000Z	grumbly	farrioth	no... i'm not at that network at the moment
2012-10-09T05:11:00.000Z	farrioth	grumbly	Can you usually, though?  If you can then we'll go with having the NAS mount itself; if not, I'll explain the polling option.
2012-10-09T05:12:00.000Z	grumbly	farrioth	I have honestly never tried.  It hasn't really been used for anything, then today, boss said "hey, why don't you automate this file stuff"  and I said "uhhh... OK"
2012-10-09T05:13:00.000Z	farrioth	grumbly	Okay, let's go with the polling.  I'll write a script and get back to you in a few mins.
2012-10-09T05:13:00.000Z	grumbly	farrioth	you, senator, are a generous man.

2012-10-09T05:29:00.000Z	farrioth	grumbly	Change the first three variables, and perhaps the sleep timeouts.
2012-10-09T05:30:00.000Z	farrioth	grumbly	Then let me know if it doesn't work or if any of the script doesn't make sense.
2012-10-09T05:30:00.000Z	grumbly	farrioth	THANK YOU!  I will..  it will be tomorrow around this same time
2012-10-09T05:33:00.000Z	farrioth	grumbly	You're welcome.  Just checking you got my private message?
2012-10-09T05:34:00.000Z	grumbly	farrioth	just saw it
2012-10-09T05:34:00.000Z	grumbly	farrioth	thank you a lot
2012-10-09T05:34:00.000Z	farrioth	grumbly	No problem.
