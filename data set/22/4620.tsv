2007-12-14T05:05:00.000Z	picard_pwns_kirk		I'm having problems installing Ubuntu gutsy on a Thinkpad T series, trying to dual-boot Vista, with a SATA hard drive, brand new
2007-12-14T05:06:00.000Z	xenthro	picard_pwns_kirk	what specific problem are you having?
2007-12-14T05:07:00.000Z	picard_pwns_kirk	xenthro	it displays errors whenever I go to resize the Vista partition
2007-12-14T05:09:00.000Z	xenthro	picard_pwns_kirk	I don't know how good the partitioner is at working with vista... even partition magic, the prog I always use and is the defacto standard in partition tools is not compatible with vista
2007-12-14T05:09:00.000Z	picard_pwns_kirk	xenthro	recommend a plan of action?
2007-12-14T05:10:00.000Z	xenthro	picard_pwns_kirk	gimme a minute...

2007-12-14T05:20:00.000Z	picard_pwns_kirk	xenthro	I can't resize a partition I'm using
2007-12-14T05:24:00.000Z	xenthro	picard_pwns_kirk	I don't use vista... but recovery partitions are extremely annoying and often screw with partitioning.. which is what happened with me. When i got my laptop I formatted the whole thing, all partitions, used the ubuntu cd to create 3 partitions, then installed windows in the first partition
2007-12-14T05:25:00.000Z	picard_pwns_kirk	xenthro	should I just do that?
2007-12-14T05:25:00.000Z	xenthro	picard_pwns_kirk	that is what "I" would recommend, based on years of frustration with pre-installed crap
2007-12-14T05:28:00.000Z	xenthro	picard_pwns_kirk	just make sure that windows goes on the first partition. It will not be bootable if it is past the 1024 cylinder boundary. linux can go anywhere
