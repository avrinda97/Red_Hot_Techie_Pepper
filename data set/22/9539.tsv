2004-10-01T08:29:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	'splash' is a bit of a legacy which we've left there because we'll probably want it later
2004-10-01T08:29:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	we do not do bootsplash currently
2004-10-01T11:01:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	completely automatic upgrades are not recommended; occasionally upgrades have to ask a question
2004-10-01T11:01:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	you might like to use 'apt-get -dy dist-upgrade' to just download everything, then you can do the actual upgrade later
2004-10-01T11:04:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	no, universe is everything in Debian main that's not Warty main
2004-10-11T07:42:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	just switch to tty2 and modprobe it by hand, no need for a boot parameter
2004-10-17T07:40:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	often, but it's usually best to aim questions at developers in general or at the bug tracking system rather than at one particular very heavily-loaded developer. :)
2004-10-17T07:40:00.000Z	aitrus	Kamion	well, i wanted to talk to him in private about his alsa decision  -- i didn't want to start a public debate/war
2004-10-17T07:42:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	wouldn't presume to decide for somebody else, but perhaps private mail would be better
2004-10-17T07:43:00.000Z	aitrus	Kamion	alrighty
2004-10-17T08:20:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	2.6.8.1's the first such I've ever seen
2004-10-17T08:20:00.000Z	aitrus	Kamion	whew... thought i was stuck really old school
2004-10-17T08:20:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	presumably because it was a *very* quick fix on top of 2.6.8 (http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.8.1)
2004-10-17T08:20:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	doubt it'll be a regular occurrence
2004-10-17T08:21:00.000Z	aitrus	Kamion	i hope not  =)
2004-10-24T07:50:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	wouldn't surprise me
2004-10-24T07:50:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	we got a lot of GNOME 2.8.1 uploads today
2004-10-24T07:51:00.000Z	aitrus	Kamion	thanks... i just applied about 100 last nite and wondered if maybe i was goofing with something
2004-10-24T07:54:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	should slow right down from now on
2004-10-24T07:55:00.000Z	aitrus	Kamion	is that cause the full release is about done and out?
2004-10-24T07:59:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	working on the release candidate now
2004-10-24T08:47:00.000Z	Kamion	aitrus	yes, but I wasn't sure if $EDITOR would be something he was familiar with
