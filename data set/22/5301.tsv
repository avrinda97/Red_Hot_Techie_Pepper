2007-05-29T14:44:00.000Z	SgtFox		hey guys, can anyone tell me if there's an easy way to *Nuke all traces of Grub from my system*?
2007-05-29T14:45:00.000Z	SgtFox		unfortunately, there's no easy way to to do that with my Vista DVD
2007-05-29T14:46:00.000Z	SgtFox		they've replaced XP's useful recovery console with some ridiculous graphical interface that can't find my installation
2007-05-29T14:47:00.000Z	SgtFox		well, Ubuntu killed my Windows installation, so it's kind of forcing itself on me
2007-05-29T14:47:00.000Z	SgtFox		;)
2007-05-29T14:48:00.000Z	nuu	SgtFox	what's the matter ?
2007-05-29T14:49:00.000Z	SgtFox	nuu	- trying to install Ubuntu from my LIveCD took out my Vista installation and didn't work in itself
2007-05-29T14:49:00.000Z	nuu	SgtFox	it probably just overwrote the boot loader, installing grub
2007-05-29T14:51:00.000Z	nuu	SgtFox	you can either restore the windows bootloader using bootsect/bcdedit from the vista cd, or add the windows partition manually to grub using the linux live cd you're already using
2007-05-29T14:52:00.000Z	nuu	SgtFox	of course if i were you, i wouldnt expect much help with the former in here ;)
2007-05-29T14:52:00.000Z	nuu	SgtFox	if that's the issue, then it's a most trivial fix
2007-05-29T14:53:00.000Z	nuu	SgtFox	just bear in mind that grub starts numbering disks from 0, whileas the devices are numbered starting from 1
2007-05-29T14:53:00.000Z	nuu	SgtFox	for instance, disk /dev/hda1 (first disk on first ide channel) will be hd(0,0) for grub
2007-05-29T14:54:00.000Z	SgtFox	nuu	I think I might have complicated the issue by attempting to install Ubuntu again and putting the bootloader on a different drive
2007-05-29T14:54:00.000Z	nuu	SgtFox	once you're confident you know which disk holds the boot partition you're trying to boot, you can force that into grub by editing it at runtime, and then modifying its menu file once you've booted in the system
2007-05-29T14:55:00.000Z	SgtFox	nuu	grub doesn't seem to want to let me have anything to do with it at runtime
2007-05-29T14:56:00.000Z	SgtFox	nuu	the first thing it tells me about is  stage 1.5
2007-05-29T14:56:00.000Z	nuu	SgtFox	so you can't even get INTO the grub menu, can you ?
2007-05-29T14:59:00.000Z	nuu	SgtFox	you should boot from the live cd, figure out which disk holds the boot partition you want to boot (you can use "sudo fdisk -l" for that), and then restore grub, using something along the lines of (from the cmdline you get after starting "grub" from a terminal): root(hdx,y) and setup(hdx)
2007-05-29T15:00:00.000Z	nuu	SgtFox	after that, grub should be rewritten to the boot sector of your disk, and you'll be able to boot into the grub menu - at which point you'll be able to manually edit entries (using "e" at grub boot menu), and boot into whatever partition you have setup
2007-05-29T15:02:00.000Z	SgtFox	nuu	Ok, will attempt to give that a try - it's currently telling me it's probing devices to 'guess' bios drives which is reassuring...
2007-05-29T15:03:00.000Z	SgtFox	nuu	it'd be nice if it could 'know' them
