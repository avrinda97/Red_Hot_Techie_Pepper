2008-08-16T08:28:00.000Z	Samus_Aran		that's a Unix thing.  no output from a command means it did what you asked it to do
2008-08-16T08:28:00.000Z	Samus_Aran		if you typed the command exactly as I said, and it displayed nothing, then it didn't find any NTFS partitions
2008-08-16T08:29:00.000Z	Gnea	Samus_Aran	be patient
2008-08-16T08:35:00.000Z	Gnea	Samus_Aran	we don't care about that anymore.
2008-08-16T08:36:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Gnea	why not ?  all we need is the device name, then adding a line to /etc/fstab
2008-08-16T08:36:00.000Z	Gnea	Samus_Aran	yeah, if his SATA drive would show up correctly
2008-08-16T08:37:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Gnea	how do you know it isn't showing up, we don't have the output of: sudo fdisk -l
2008-08-16T08:45:00.000Z	Gnea	Samus_Aran	no..
2008-08-16T08:46:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Gnea	?
2008-08-16T08:46:00.000Z	Gnea	Samus_Aran	do you work in IT?
2008-08-16T08:46:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Gnea	why do you ask ?
2008-08-16T08:46:00.000Z	Gnea	Samus_Aran	it's just a yes/no question.
2008-08-16T08:46:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Gnea	one which I'm not going to answer to you without good reason
2008-08-16T08:47:00.000Z	Gnea	Samus_Aran	Because I do, and I am acutely aware of how dangerous opening a case while it's turned on.
2008-08-16T08:47:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Gnea	oh please, do enlighten me how opening a case is "dangerous"
2008-08-16T08:48:00.000Z	Gnea	Samus_Aran	clearly, you are not a real tech. yes, let's just end this discussion now.
2008-08-16T08:48:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Gnea	bull---.  =)  I've opened dozens of computers while they run, and have had 0 issues.  they are fully grounded, PSUs are grounded, the motherboards are grounded.
2008-08-16T08:49:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Gnea	SATA drives are fully hot-swappable.
2008-08-16T08:49:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Gnea	internal or external
2008-08-16T08:52:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Gnea	an re your insult: clearly you are not in the real world and do not have much of an understanding of electricity.
2008-08-16T08:53:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Gnea	so come to #ubuntu-offtopic ?
2008-08-16T08:53:00.000Z	Gnea	Samus_Aran	you got it.
