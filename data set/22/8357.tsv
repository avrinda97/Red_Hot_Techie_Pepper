2005-10-20T14:44:00.000Z	Norgus		hello people
2005-10-20T14:44:00.000Z	Norgus		I seem unable to get past partitioning on breezy badger
2005-10-20T14:44:00.000Z	Norgus		(using a SATA drive)
2005-10-20T14:45:00.000Z	Norgus		does anyone know if its isn't possible to install and boot from a SATA hard drive?
2005-10-20T14:46:00.000Z	walde	Norgus	as long your sata-controller is supported, no problem.
2005-10-20T14:46:00.000Z	Norgus		I have an nforce board
2005-10-20T14:46:00.000Z	Norgus		erm asus a7n8x-e or something
2005-10-20T14:46:00.000Z	Norgus		yeah nforce 2
2005-10-20T14:47:00.000Z	Norgus		it said the kernel couldnt tell about changes to the device or something
2005-10-20T14:47:00.000Z	Norgus		and failer to make the partitions or the filesystem
2005-10-20T14:47:00.000Z	Norgus		failed*
2005-10-20T14:48:00.000Z	Norgus		do I need to manually select some controller?
2005-10-20T14:49:00.000Z	walde	Norgus	nforce2-sata should work fine without problems as long you dont use raid
2005-10-20T14:49:00.000Z	Norgus		I havn't selected to use raid
2005-10-20T14:49:00.000Z	Norgus		erm one weird thing is I saw all my partitions on that drive twice
2005-10-20T14:50:00.000Z	walde	Norgus	using which tool?
2005-10-20T14:50:00.000Z	Norgus	walde	I tried lvm thenwithout lvm
2005-10-20T14:50:00.000Z	walde	Norgus	sorry, I never experimented with lvm. Cannot tell you something about this symptoms.
2005-10-20T14:51:00.000Z	Norgus	walde	maybe it will work if I delete all the partitions on the drive THEN run the installer?
2005-10-20T14:52:00.000Z	walde	Norgus	yes, it is a try. It is nice, if you dont have to care for data :-)
2005-10-20T14:52:00.000Z	walde	Norgus	or you use "cfdisk -z" it starts with a zero-partitiontable
2005-10-20T14:53:00.000Z	Norgus	walde	I have a load of data backed up to dvd and my IDE hard drive
