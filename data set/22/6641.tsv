2006-08-30T10:03:00.000Z	dcstimm_		Anyone know how ubuntu sees the volume names of different drives that are plugged in?  For example I have a firewire hfsplus formatted harddrive and it knows the name of it, but I cant find any command line tools that tell me the same
2006-08-30T10:04:00.000Z	ladydoor	dcstimm_	it uses the gnome-volume-manager. and you might try "less /etc/fstab" for a start :-)
2006-08-30T10:05:00.000Z	dcstimm_	ladydoor	ok, but if I am not running gnome will the volume manager work in the command line?
2006-08-30T10:05:00.000Z	ladydoor	dcstimm_	try less /etc/fstab for a start
2006-08-30T10:05:00.000Z	ladydoor	dcstimm_	another option for things you plug in could be dmsg | tail
2006-08-30T10:05:00.000Z	dcstimm_	ladydoor	i know how fstab work, but when I am not in the gui and I mount a volume I cant see the name of it
2006-08-30T10:05:00.000Z	ladydoor	dcstimm_	after you plug them in
2006-08-30T10:06:00.000Z	dcstimm_	ladydoor	that still doesnt show me the volume name, it shows me sda or what device name it has
2006-08-30T10:06:00.000Z	ladydoor	dcstimm_	ah. well, i'im not sure what you're talking about then. sorry
2006-08-30T10:06:00.000Z	dcstimm_	ladydoor	so for example if I have a drive called "Bob's Backup Drive"  How do I find that info out?
2006-08-30T10:07:00.000Z	ladydoor	dcstimm_	yeah...sorry. i really don't know :-(
2006-08-30T10:07:00.000Z	dcstimm_	ladydoor	plugg that drive into macosx it mounts it as Bob's Backup Drive, and the same with ubuntu, but if I mount that drive manually I cant find that information
2006-08-30T10:07:00.000Z	ladydoor	dcstimm_	right, and i don't know where to find it. i'm sorry
2006-08-30T10:24:00.000Z	ladydoor	dcstimm_	if you've installed 6.06 and done your updates, you *have* 6.06.1
