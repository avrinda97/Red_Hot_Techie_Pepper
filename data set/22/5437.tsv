2008-10-27T00:17:00.000Z	army12bc		what's the best way to test a firewall
2008-10-27T00:18:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	nmap it
2008-10-27T00:24:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	best to nmap from another system
2008-10-27T06:02:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	it's just wine with extra stuff to make it work better under the hood
2008-10-27T06:06:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	right, not everything is free - the license provisions that it doesn't have to be - but i can tell you that both are worth it, depending on what you need to do
2008-10-28T10:01:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	arguments before filenames, always
2008-10-28T10:02:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	like -t iso9660, -o ro, loop=/dev/loop0
2008-10-28T10:08:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	okay, with the mount command, it blindly assumes that commandline switches, AKA arguments, are to be given before the filenames/devices/directories are -  so: sudo mount -t iso9660 -o ro /home/eorge/Battlefield_2142-Razor1911_to_mount_on /dev/loop0   is probably what you're looking for
2008-10-28T10:09:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	are you stuck in a chroot?
2008-10-28T10:11:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	well, i ask because sudo is a defacto program in ubuntu - for it to not be there denotes that: a) the PATH has been tampered with, or b) the shell has been chroot'd
2008-10-28T10:11:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	or c) it's been removed somehow
2008-10-28T10:12:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	try:  sudo -i
2008-10-28T10:13:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	open up a whole new terminal window, please
2008-10-28T10:15:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	okay, exit from that shel and try the  sudo mount -t iso9660 -o ro /home/eorge/Battlefield_2142-Razor1911_to_mount_on /dev/loop0
2008-10-28T10:16:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	 exit
2008-10-28T10:17:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	okay, try this:  mkdir tmp && mount -t loop /home/george/Battlefield_2142-Razor1911_to_mount_on tmp/
2008-10-28T10:19:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	sorry, should be:   sudo mount -o loop /home/george/Battlefield_2142-Razor1911_to_mount_on tmp/
2008-10-28T10:20:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	then you need to check the Battlefield filename and make sure to type the right one in
2008-10-28T10:22:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	okay, is this a game that you downloaded?
2008-10-28T10:23:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	okay - where is the rzr-2142.iso reside?
2008-10-28T10:25:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	yeah, sorry, can't continue, we don't support warez in here.
2008-10-28T10:25:00.000Z	Gnea	army12bc	do not argue, you downloaded it from a bittorrent site, it's warez.
