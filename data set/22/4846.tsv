2008-04-04T23:57:00.000Z	KleRoi		ups, sorry. erstazi and bazhang: i see my wireless now. i've connected it with the ac adaptor, maybe i didn't see it before because i was on low battery
2008-04-04T23:57:00.000Z	bazhang	KleRoi	hahaha
2008-04-04T23:31:00.000Z	bazhang	KleRoi	what does lspci say abou t that card please
2008-04-04T23:31:00.000Z	KleRoi	bazhang	03:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection (rev 02)
2008-04-04T23:32:00.000Z	bazhang	KleRoi	that card is the best supported in linux/ubuntu; I have the same card and it is a treat--what does ifconfig show; just eth0 and lo?
2008-04-04T23:34:00.000Z	bazhang	KleRoi	check the restricted driver manager for that card
2008-04-04T23:35:00.000Z	KleRoi	bazhang	 if I try to open it it says that i need linux-restricted-modules-2.6.22-14-386
2008-04-04T23:35:00.000Z	bazhang	KleRoi	then install them
2008-04-04T23:37:00.000Z	bazhang	KleRoi	you will be glad you have that card ;]
2008-04-04T23:37:00.000Z	KleRoi	bazhang	hehe i hope so, i've tried a couple of things but i was starting to fear that my card wasn't good with gutsy :\
2008-04-04T23:38:00.000Z	bazhang	KleRoi	that card is the star of all cards--in gutsy hardy and beyond (other distros as well)
2008-04-04T23:40:00.000Z	bazhang	KleRoi	its been awhile; does ifconfig show the card now? cant remember if you need a reboot or not
2008-04-04T23:41:00.000Z	bazhang	KleRoi	guess you need to reboot; be sure that the laptop kill switch for internet is switched to wireless on--I had some embarassing time when I left it off and could not get wireless working ;]
2008-04-04T23:50:00.000Z	KleRoi	bazhang	 hi, it's me again. the problem isn't fixed yet, i can't seem to see any wireless device altho there has been 2 changes: in the network manager now there is the "wireless" option while before it wasn't there. also sometimes the wireless "thingy" outside the laptop to turn it on and off has made a couple of flashes while before it was always off. if I do ifconfig i just see eth0 and lo
2008-04-04T23:51:00.000Z	bazhang	KleRoi	great news; now try iwconfig and see what that shows
2008-04-04T23:52:00.000Z	bazhang	KleRoi	you have a hotspot (wifi) to test it on?
2008-04-04T23:52:00.000Z	KleRoi	bazhang	 yes i do have a wireless net in my house. also in lo and eth0 it says no wireless extension, while in eth1 it says unassociated and a bunch of other stuff
2008-04-04T23:53:00.000Z	bazhang	KleRoi	is the hot spot open wep wpa/wpa2 or what
2008-04-04T23:54:00.000Z	KleRoi	bazhang	it should be wpa. erstazi: ok i'm doing that
2008-04-04T23:57:00.000Z	bazhang	KleRoi	listen to erstazi--he knows what he is doing; also be thankful you have that card and not a broadcom ;]
