2006-04-28T08:03:00.000Z	arun_		sorry i got disc... i want to know if there is a default root password..
2006-04-28T08:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	arun_	no. Use sudo & your own user pw
2007-10-09T10:11:00.000Z	Madpilot	arun_	for basic FTP, Nautilus does nicely. For everything else, use Filezilla.
2007-10-09T10:11:00.000Z	arun_	Madpilot	FileZilla doesn't work with Linux-based OSes, does it?
2007-10-09T10:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	arun_	the Linux version is in stable beta.
2007-10-09T10:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	arun_	and it's in Universe as of Feisty
2007-10-09T10:14:00.000Z	arun_	Madpilot	Do you use it?
2007-10-09T10:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	arun_	when I moved to Ubuntu from XP, that was (seriously) the only app I actually missed. Glad the Linux port works now.
2007-10-09T10:15:00.000Z	arun_	Madpilot	Yeah, me too. I'm happy that there's a linux port now. How long has it been unavailable?
2007-10-09T10:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	arun_	the Linux port came out earlier this year, and made it into Feisty back in April
2007-10-09T10:15:00.000Z	arun_	Madpilot	How do you log out of FTP sessions in Nautilus?
2007-10-09T10:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	arun_	just collapse the file tree.
2007-10-09T10:16:00.000Z	arun_	Madpilot	I tried kftpgrabber when I was using Kubuntu.. it's a good application as well, but not quite as good as Filezilla.
2007-10-09T10:20:00.000Z	arun_	Madpilot	Is there any way to get Filezilla to use icons from the Human theme?
2007-10-09T10:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	arun_	don't think so - it uses some 3rd party widget library
2007-10-09T11:06:00.000Z	arun_	Madpilot	still here?
2007-10-09T11:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	arun_	yes - what's up?
2007-10-09T11:06:00.000Z	arun_	Madpilot	I found a way to use Tango icons with Filezilla
2007-10-09T11:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	arun_	what's the trick?
2007-10-09T11:07:00.000Z	arun_	Madpilot	Just pick up the icon set here: http://sumowski.deviantart.com/art/FileZilla-Tango-55312081
2007-10-09T11:07:00.000Z	arun_	Madpilot	and go to /usr/share/filezilla/resources/16x16/
2007-10-09T11:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	arun_	very cool - thanks! Bookmarked that.
