2008-08-30T05:49:00.000Z	perillux		can someone tell me what "GTK 2.x" is?
2008-08-30T05:49:00.000Z	jrib	perillux	GUI toolkit
2008-08-30T05:50:00.000Z	perillux	jrib	like metacity, or compiz?
2008-08-30T05:50:00.000Z	jrib	perillux	no, like gtk or qt
2008-08-30T05:50:00.000Z	jrib	perillux	why do you want to know?
2008-08-30T05:51:00.000Z	perillux	jrib	Megaqwerty: I'm just looking around in gnome-look.org and I found a cool theme and it says Type: GTK 2.x Theme/Style  and I'm wondering if I can use it
2008-08-30T05:52:00.000Z	jrib	perillux	yes.  It changes the way your buttons, lists, etc look like
2008-08-30T05:52:00.000Z	perillux	jrib	Megaqwerty: but do I have to download a gtk package or something to be able to use it?
2008-08-30T05:53:00.000Z	jrib	perillux	nope.  You use it in system -> preferences -> appearance
2008-10-17T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	perillux	no, you don't need windows to run virtualbox in ubuntu
2008-10-17T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	perillux	however, if you want to run windows /inside/ virtualbox on ubuntu, you'll need a windows disk to install it of course
2008-10-17T06:50:00.000Z	perillux	jrib	i never got a windows CD when I bought my laptop
2008-10-17T06:50:00.000Z	perillux	jrib	it was already installed
2008-10-17T06:50:00.000Z	perillux	jrib	but I overwrote it all with Ubuntu
2008-10-17T06:51:00.000Z	jrib	perillux	contact your manufacturer or borrow a cd from someone and use your license key (there should be a sticker on your laptop with it)
2008-10-17T06:51:00.000Z	perillux	jrib	is there anything similar to virtualBox that would allow me to run a small windows desktop because I just want it so I can play an old game
2008-10-17T06:52:00.000Z	jrib	perillux	you're not going to install windows on anything without a windows disk.  You could try wine to run some windows programs as others are suggesting.  wine is not windows though

2008-10-17T06:53:00.000Z	perillux	jrib	thanks for all your help
2009-03-19T02:19:00.000Z	jrib	perillux	/me gueses ~/.dmrc
2009-03-22T20:36:00.000Z	jrib	perillux	you can use sed to do that
2009-03-22T20:36:00.000Z	perillux	jrib	thanks
