2012-08-23T19:04:00.000Z	Sokel		what mounting issue exactly?
2012-08-23T19:05:00.000Z	MoTec	Sokel	samba, cifs, and apparently nfs shares do not mount automatically after a reboot.  There is a _netdev directive that can be added to the appropriate line in /etc/fstab to allow the network to startup before the volume is mounted but it is not honored.
2012-08-23T19:09:00.000Z	Sokel		Why not just use autofs? At least that way, you don't need to use /etc/fstab.
2012-08-23T19:09:00.000Z	Sokel		Or make things easier, and do your mounts in /etc/rc.local after everything is booted up
2012-08-23T19:10:00.000Z	MoTec	Sokel	So rc.local is processed every boot?
2012-08-23T19:10:00.000Z	Sokel	capitaninsaneoh	Depends on where the webserver is going to be in your network. Is it going to be in the front of the line with the modem, or the in the back behind the firewall
2012-08-23T19:10:00.000Z	Sokel		Motec: It is processed every boot. I process my iptables rules that way on ym router.
2012-08-23T19:10:00.000Z	Sokel		motec: Because I dislike using ufw.
2012-08-23T19:10:00.000Z	MoTec	Sokel	I'll give that a shot
2012-08-23T19:10:00.000Z	Sokel		Motec: Let me know how it goes :)
2012-08-23T19:11:00.000Z	Sokel	capitaninsaneoh	Alrighty. Good luck. I'll be here if you need me. You can pm me if needed.
2012-08-23T19:11:00.000Z	Sokel	capitaninsaneoh	I recommend doing specific rules.
2012-08-23T19:11:00.000Z	Sokel	capitaninsaneoh	You might want to look into that first. DMZ is not the answer.
2012-08-23T19:13:00.000Z	Sokel	capitaninsaneoh	And why's that exactly
2012-08-23T19:14:00.000Z	Sokel	capitaninsaneoh	It's not hard to setup rules for specific ports and not leaving your server wide open. That's like saying I should disable selinux because a program can't access the required files.
2012-08-23T19:15:00.000Z	Sokel		MoteC: Make sure you chmod +x on /etc/rc.local. It'll help you out.
2012-08-23T19:16:00.000Z	Sokel	capitaninsaneoh	DMZ means it's wide open. Good on ya, Jim.
2012-08-23T19:16:00.000Z	Sokel		Yeah. Right. lol Keep telling yourself that.
2012-08-23T19:18:00.000Z	Sokel		Hey, you're the one who wants a DMZ and thinks it's "secure" lol.
2012-08-23T19:19:00.000Z	Sokel		The point is: Don't be stupid.
2012-08-23T19:19:00.000Z	Sokel		Blocked.
2012-08-23T19:42:00.000Z	MoTec	Sokel	just putting mount -a in my rc.local did the trick.  I'm back on track, I think!
