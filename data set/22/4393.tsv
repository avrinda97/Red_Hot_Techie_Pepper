2011-02-22T05:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SliMM	its a GT435M, so yes. The proprietary driver will run it

2011-02-22T05:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SliMM	what's that?
2011-02-22T05:19:00.000Z	SliMM	ActionParsnip	core i5 has an integrated gpu that generally gets priority
2011-02-22T05:19:00.000Z	SliMM	ActionParsnip	and nvidia doesn't have proper drivers for linux
2011-02-22T05:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SliMM	oh one of those dual vga card things
2011-02-22T05:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SliMM	nvidia have been supporting linux for AGES
2011-02-22T05:20:00.000Z	SliMM	ActionParsnip	not optimus

2011-02-22T05:20:00.000Z	SliMM	ActionParsnip	software switch
2011-02-22T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SliMM	i've seen people write scripts and guis for it, personally I advise staying away from stuff like that

2011-02-22T05:22:00.000Z	SliMM	ActionParsnip	i don't want that thing, i just want to make sure i can disable it without disabling the nvidia card as well
