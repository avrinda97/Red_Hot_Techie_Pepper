2007-05-31T16:33:00.000Z	basic		the driver isnt even loading
2007-05-31T16:34:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	what's the output from `lspci -v|grep -i audio` in a Terminal?
2007-05-31T16:37:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	now, `lsmod|grep ^snd_hda_intel`
2007-05-31T16:37:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	`sudo modprobe snd_hda_intel`
2007-05-31T16:38:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	err, did you attempt to compile ALSA yourself or something?
2007-05-31T16:38:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	...then how did snd-hda-intel.ko disappear?
2007-05-31T16:39:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	uname -r
2007-05-31T16:39:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	sudo apt-get --reinstall linux-image-$(uname -r)
2007-05-31T16:40:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	sorry
2007-05-31T16:40:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	sudo apt-get --reinstall install linux-image-$(uname -r)
2007-05-31T16:40:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	`` and $() are interchangeable
2007-05-31T16:41:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	I can't reproduce your issue on a fresh install with 2.6.20-16-generic
2007-05-31T16:42:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	I know it ships by default and on upgrade, so something must have interrupted your update.
2007-05-31T16:51:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	`uname -r`
2007-05-31T16:51:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	you still need to tell me the output.
2007-05-31T16:54:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	modules don't "disappear" - either a script is erasing the module, or something else.
2007-05-31T16:54:00.000Z	basic	crimsun	yeah, but it was gone after a reboot
2007-05-31T16:54:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	see above.
2007-05-31T16:55:00.000Z	basic	crimsun	i can open the volume control right now, but it still has a red circle with a line through it in the tray
2007-05-31T16:56:00.000Z	crimsun	basic	well, is snd_hda_intel loaded?  I gave you the lsmod command for it earlier.
2007-05-31T16:58:00.000Z	basic	crimsun	yes, it's loaded, the module installed after the kernel reinstall.. then i modprobed the snd_hda_intel and i can change volume levels
