2007-07-29T15:53:00.000Z	ShackJack		bill you can edit /boot/grub/menu.1st and swap the order of O/S :0
2007-07-29T15:54:00.000Z	ShackJack		bill gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.1st   -- file heavily commented you should be able to see what to do to change order...
2007-07-29T15:54:00.000Z	ShackJack		!hi | Ace2016
2007-07-29T15:56:00.000Z	ShackJack		!oh my | ubuntu_
2007-07-29T15:56:00.000Z	vox754	ShackJack	ops, fast!
2007-07-30T16:10:00.000Z	ShackJack	vox754	Eh? How could fyrestrtr anticipate bill would do that? - I don't think so... Anyhew...
2007-07-30T16:10:00.000Z	vox754	ShackJack	yes, first thing you tell a newbie, is "Do not paste here under any circumstances"... then you give him the !paste factoid. Ha.
2007-07-30T16:11:00.000Z	ShackJack	vox754	So anytime someone says "I'm a newbie" I should just !pastebin | newbie :)
2007-07-30T16:12:00.000Z	vox754	ShackJack	approximately, you use "!paste > newbie"   ha, take that
2007-07-30T16:24:00.000Z	vox754	ShackJack	he won't understand... no need to give the factoid in the main channel all over again.
2007-07-30T05:23:00.000Z	vox754	ShackJack	I know. He left, so it is no good to say anything else. Grr. Those damn hardware manufacturers.
2007-07-30T05:23:00.000Z	ShackJack	vox754	No -darn Linux for not supporting every single piece of hardware ever made!
2007-07-30T05:24:00.000Z	ShackJack	vox754	I like that expression though - "beyond insane" ;)
2007-07-30T05:24:00.000Z	vox754	ShackJack	he he... I hope he comes back. At least I want to explain that.
2007-07-30T05:26:00.000Z	ShackJack	vox754	Dang I found the driver for his card - took all of 1 min. Googling... http://www.winischhofer.eu/linuxsispart1.shtml#introduction
2007-07-30T05:27:00.000Z	vox754	ShackJack	I won't take a look since I suppose is the "generic" one. I don't think he was stupid, but stubborn.
2007-07-30T05:53:00.000Z	ShackJack	vox754	Reboot? That's soooo Windows ;)
2007-07-30T05:54:00.000Z	vox754	ShackJack	d4rkmonkey you wouldn't believe this guy who had a problem with his sound. He asked all day long and finally rebooted. He felt stupid. Because rebooting still works sometimes.
2007-07-30T05:59:00.000Z	ShackJack	vox754	ummm... I think linux is seeing sombody else...
2007-07-30T05:59:00.000Z	ShackJack	vox754	:P
2007-07-30T06:28:00.000Z	vox754	ShackJack	towlieba I would say 1 GB is enough in most cases. Unless you really need to hibernate alot. maybe this will cahnge in the future with 64 bit processors and 8 or more GB RAM
2007-07-30T06:28:00.000Z	ShackJack	vox754	towlieba: I assume hibernation so 1.5 to 2 is a good benchmark and most drives have the space...
