2010-03-23T01:47:00.000Z	Aeronious		Hello, I'm at my University Library, and after about an hour of being connected to the wireless internet, my connection quits working.  I called my school's tech support and they told me they don't support linux, but that I should try to release and renew my IP address.  I've tried some of the instructions on the forums, but it's still not working.  Any help?
2010-03-23T01:47:00.000Z	Aeronious		CAN ANYONE HELP?
2010-03-23T01:49:00.000Z	Aeronious		yes, everytime
2010-03-23T01:50:00.000Z	Aeronious		I guess the lease on the IP expires, but I can't get my laptop to release and renew, even with a reboot
2010-03-23T01:52:00.000Z	Aeronious		If this involves me talking to a techie, there's no chance. University Library.  University tech can't help

2010-03-23T01:55:00.000Z	Typos_King	Aeronious	  what was the original inquiry?
2010-03-23T01:57:00.000Z	Typos_King	Aeronious	  ... it might be your access point, no?
2010-03-23T01:59:00.000Z	Typos_King	Aeronious	  and this is happening only in the *nix session?   tried yet in the win32/macOSX? same?
2010-03-23T02:02:00.000Z	Typos_King	Aeronious	  and this is happening only in the *nix session?   tried yet in the win32/macOSX? same?
2010-03-23T02:04:00.000Z	Typos_King	Aeronious	  soooo, you don't  know if it's THEM on the university doing any timing?
2010-03-23T02:05:00.000Z	Typos_King	Aeronious	  rather than your installion drivers or configuration
2010-03-23T02:05:00.000Z	Typos_King	Aeronious	  is this a mobile or desktop?
2010-03-23T02:06:00.000Z	Typos_King	Aeronious	    oooook.... have you tried other hotspots, say some local cafe or the local library, if they also do the same to assess is your installation?
2010-03-23T02:08:00.000Z	Typos_King	Aeronious	    no coincidence... since you haven't checked, is not an uncommon practice for some 'public' hotspots to do such, the local library here used to, they don't now, but they also presented you with an information page before click OK/Connect letting you know your connection was going to drop in 1hr, and youhad to reconnect and that you didn't need to close your browser
2010-03-23T02:09:00.000Z	Typos_King	Aeronious	    I should point out that even though they don't now, they still may drop the connection if there is 'idle' activity for a certain period of time, and you have to reconnect
2010-03-23T02:11:00.000Z	Typos_King	Aeronious	    that's  not the issue, the issue is, you dunno what their policy and practice is on the provided connectivity, at least for now, try some other wireless hotspot at a local cafe, it'll just cost you a cup of coffee :P
2010-03-23T02:11:00.000Z	Aeronious	Typos_King	not an option, thank you
2010-03-23T02:11:00.000Z	Typos_King	Aeronious	    then you don't know if they're doing it, or they're not
2010-03-23T02:14:00.000Z	Aeronious	Typos_King	I have wireless at home, which works all the time, if that's what you mean
2010-03-23T02:14:00.000Z	Typos_King	Aeronious	    is that provided by the same university?
