2009-04-30T05:27:00.000Z	saiki		what do you do when a partial fails?
2009-04-30T05:28:00.000Z	saiki		partial upgrade*
2009-04-30T05:30:00.000Z	saiki		how do you fix a partial upgrade failing?
2009-04-30T05:32:00.000Z	losher	saiki	very much depends on the details of the failures. Some are irrecoverable, others just need a simple tweak. What happened, exactly...
2009-04-30T05:33:00.000Z	saiki	losher	it just keeps repeating
2009-04-30T05:34:00.000Z	losher	saiki	uh, repeating what?
2009-04-30T05:34:00.000Z	saiki	losher	the same updates, over and over
2009-04-30T05:38:00.000Z	losher	saiki	I thought autoremove needed a package name?
2009-04-30T05:39:00.000Z	losher	saiki	you seem very sure for someone whose upgrade isn't working...
2009-04-30T05:39:00.000Z	saiki	losher	2 to remove, 40 installed and 28 upgraded
2009-04-30T05:40:00.000Z	saiki	losher	I've done it before
2009-04-30T05:40:00.000Z	losher	saiki	I thought the usual method was 'apt-get update; apt-get upgrade; apt-get dist-upgrade' ?
2009-04-30T05:41:00.000Z	saiki	losher	I'm already on jaunty
2009-04-30T05:41:00.000Z	losher	saiki	sorry, no idea then...
2009-04-30T05:42:00.000Z	saiki	losher	can it be logged?
2009-04-30T05:42:00.000Z	saiki	losher	maybe a log will tell me what's going on
2009-04-30T05:51:00.000Z	saiki	losher	fixed it, old packages with no new ones that jaunty doesn't see
2009-04-30T05:51:00.000Z	losher	saiki	that's good
2009-04-30T05:52:00.000Z	saiki	losher	ye, but I lost alot of my games :@
2009-04-30T05:52:00.000Z	losher	saiki	no backup, no sympathy....
