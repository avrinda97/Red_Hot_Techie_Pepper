2006-06-26T12:01:00.000Z	Ademan	Pharaoh_Atem	wow, that's unheard of... lol... i'm willing to bet money if you re-torrent the iso and burned it again it would work, happened to me with a debian install cd
2006-06-26T12:01:00.000Z	Pharaoh_Atem	Ademan	well i already spent 3 hours installing Ubuntu Breezy Badger
2006-06-26T12:24:00.000Z	Pharaoh_Atem	Ademan	do you know how to force the system to probe for ISA devices?
