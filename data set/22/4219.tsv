2008-02-16T15:09:00.000Z	prince_jammys	simplg	describe exacty what you want -- you a want a line number or the content of the line -- and what is special about the line you want?

2008-02-16T15:11:00.000Z	simplg	prince_jammys	I want the content of the line according to number
2008-02-16T15:13:00.000Z	prince_jammys	simplg	i dont understand exactly what you need.  you want to output lines that contain a specific text?
2008-02-16T15:14:00.000Z	prince_jammys	simplg	or text pattern?   these questions are difficult to answer if you don't give a good description of what you need, and what your input file looks like -- and what you want to output
2008-02-16T15:16:00.000Z	simplg	prince_jammys	ok. i need to output line in accordance with its number (number of line).
2008-02-16T15:16:00.000Z	prince_jammys		simpleg: you just want to add line numbers to every line in the file?
2008-02-16T15:18:00.000Z	prince_jammys	simplg	if that is what you want, you can do "   cat -n filename "   ---> try for example cat -n /etc/fstab
2008-02-16T15:18:00.000Z	simplg	prince_jammys	sorry. i need to output content of line in accordance with its number (number of line).
2008-02-16T15:19:00.000Z	simplg	prince_jammys	no... this is not that... but thank you for you help
2008-02-16T15:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	simplg	#bash, but they wont answer without a more specific description
2008-02-16T15:32:00.000Z	simplg	prince_jammys	ok. I found that option. This is "sed -n Np" where N is the line number
2008-02-16T15:32:00.000Z	prince_jammys	simplg	good, sorry -- i never knew what you wanted
2008-02-16T15:34:00.000Z	simplg	prince_jammys	never mind. in any case thanks :)
2008-02-16T15:37:00.000Z	prince_jammys	simplg	i see now, you wanted to print only a specified line in your file
2008-02-16T15:37:00.000Z	prince_jammys	simplg	you give the line number, and it prints only that line ..... understood
2008-02-16T15:38:00.000Z	simplg	prince_jammys	I'm from Russia. This is complex for me to describe the problem. I talk on English very bad.
2008-02-16T15:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	simplg	i understand now ... you say line 3 and it prints only line 3
