2005-08-07T16:45:00.000Z	Seveas	MikeW	2.12 you mean :)
2005-08-07T16:47:00.000Z	MikeW	Seveas	WOOHOO! I heard that gnome 2.12 is less of a slow dog then the .8 or something, because they cleaned up some horrible stupid coding mistakes. Extra performance I hope :D
2005-08-09T13:53:00.000Z	Seveas	MikeW	why are you installing warty instead of Hoary?
2005-08-09T13:53:00.000Z	MikeW	Seveas	because I only have a warty cd
2005-08-09T13:53:00.000Z	Seveas	MikeW	good reason :

2005-08-09T14:39:00.000Z	MikeW	Seveas	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=250641 seems to be the same issue for me
2005-08-09T15:06:00.000Z	MikeW	Seveas	what should my first partition be?
2005-08-09T15:06:00.000Z	MikeW	Seveas	mount point / or /home?
2005-08-09T15:06:00.000Z	MikeW	Seveas	asides from swap, do I need another one?

2005-08-09T15:54:00.000Z	Seveas	MikeW	what partition types have you used on that disk?
2005-08-09T15:54:00.000Z	MikeW	Seveas	1. boot, mount point: /, type resierfs. 2. swap
2005-08-09T15:55:00.000Z	Seveas	MikeW	hmm, no idea then...
