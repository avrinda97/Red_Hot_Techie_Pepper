2008-10-22T11:09:00.000Z	dmg2008		Hey everyone: does anyone know if using a windows formatted ipod 80Gb can be stuffed up if it plugged into a linux machine and accessed through amarok... my friend who put all hismusic on his ipod using vista attached his ipod to my machine so we could listen to some music from it and afterwards the ipod acts asthough there is no music there when he uses it and when he connects it to his vista machine...?
2008-10-22T11:10:00.000Z	kai696	dmg2008	you are referring to set to discmode?
2008-10-22T11:11:00.000Z	dmg2008	kai696	Not exactly. It may have been set to discmode prior by him... he's a bit clueless. When i tried to use the ipod with vista it made out as though the DB was unreadable.
2008-10-22T11:12:00.000Z	dmg2008	kai696	so I wonder if amarok wrote to it for some reason even though there was no music transferred to it
2008-10-22T11:12:00.000Z	kai696	dmg2008	Please hold when I do some research
2008-10-22T11:13:00.000Z	dmg2008	kai696	thanks in advance... i tried googling but came up with unrelated results
2008-10-22T11:14:00.000Z	kai696	dmg2008	WHat version of Windows Vista?
2008-10-22T11:14:00.000Z	dmg2008	kai696	I have no clue about vista but it is probably standard home version
2008-10-22T11:19:00.000Z	dmg2008	kai696	i don't think we did... because the music was no longer accessible from his machine I used my machine to transfer all the music to an external hard drive (which requires 2 usb ports) then plugged it into his laptop on the side with 2 ports and the ipod to the other side (where there is only 1 port) in the attempt to put the music back on the newly formatted ipod... unfortunately vista claimed to have installed the driver for the ext hd but would not s
2008-10-22T11:20:00.000Z	kai696	dmg2008	does it detect any music in Itunes? If not, Can you verify that the songs are on the Ipod?
2008-10-22T11:23:00.000Z	dmg2008	kai696	no itunes thinks the ipod is empty of songs but does register that it was at 40% capacity. Amarok confirms the music is there. I assume this means the DB is forked but amarok can still read it... That's why I was able to get the music off it. So yes the music was still there but itunes and the ipod didn't register it.
2008-10-22T11:24:00.000Z	dmg2008	kai696	I tried using amarok to repopulate the freshly formatted and updated ipod... this went well until we disconnected the ipod and found that it didn't think there was any music on there
2008-10-22T11:24:00.000Z	kai696	dmg2008	For Diagnostics mode, if it's a fifth gen, just do a hard reset and hold the left button and the center button at the same time
2008-10-22T11:26:00.000Z	dmg2008	kai696	i tried left and center but that didn't work... then i tried menu and center ... that restarted it but didn't give me diagnostics mode

2008-10-22T11:29:00.000Z	dmg2008	kai696	got it sorry
2008-10-22T11:40:00.000Z	dmg2008	kai696	I was trying to go through the diagnostics and got stuck .... I did a search for the step I'
2008-10-22T11:42:00.000Z	dmg2008	kai696	...I'm at and found a page where someone has the same problem. The answer is that sometimes files become corrupted (I guess the DB) and the only solution is to format it and resync. I can only assume that amarok is corrupting the DB somehow.
2008-10-22T11:43:00.000Z	kai696	dmg2008	:P if Itunes can be installed, i would recommend it as it has a recovery option
2008-10-22T11:44:00.000Z	dmg2008	kai696	the only problem now is that my external hd is not being registered by vista... I can't get the music off the hd onto his machine so that he can resync
2008-10-22T11:44:00.000Z	dmg2008	kai696	I'll see about getting another ext hd... Thanks for your help.
