2009-05-08T09:46:00.000Z	ankur_		I have that installed, well, let me check for it
2009-05-08T09:46:00.000Z	glitsj16	ankur_	specifically, look for sun-java6-jre
2009-05-08T09:38:00.000Z	glitsj16	ankur_	have you tried starting opera from a terminal to catch any errors it might throw?
2009-05-08T09:38:00.000Z	ankur_	glitsj16	I am a novice. Can you tell me how to do that?
2009-05-08T09:39:00.000Z	glitsj16	ankur_	sure, can you open a terminal ? when you have one open, just run "opera" and see what shows up
2009-05-08T09:40:00.000Z	glitsj16	ankur_	okay great, just paste the error on paste.ubuntu.com and put the link up here so people can see what's going on
2009-05-08T09:42:00.000Z	ankur_	glitsj16	this is the link http://paste.ubuntu.com/166507/
2009-05-08T09:42:00.000Z	glitsj16	ankur_	okay thanks, taking a look
2009-05-08T09:45:00.000Z	glitsj16	ankur_	do you have java jre installed ? check in synaptic and search for that , loks like opera doesn't find those
2009-05-08T09:48:00.000Z	ankur_	glitsj16	I have Sun-java6-jre 6-13-1 installed already
2009-05-08T09:49:00.000Z	glitsj16	ankur_	okay, there's a LD_PRELOAD in your error paste, not sure where you can try to undo that, opera seems not to like it getting started that way
2009-05-08T10:08:00.000Z	glitsj16	ankur_	look in your .opera folder for a file javapath.txt and see if zvacet's proposed changes can be set there
2009-05-08T10:09:00.000Z	ankur_	glitsj16	I am trying to do that. (Actually I am hitting in the dark, well, not a bad start for learning)
2009-05-08T10:10:00.000Z	glitsj16	ankur_	take your time, we'll flash a torch if you're not back in 30 minutes
2009-05-08T10:17:00.000Z	ankur_	glitsj16	I have managed to reach the folder you told, but I can't find javapath.txt file
2009-05-08T10:18:00.000Z	glitsj16	ankur_	okay, so i suggest making a file in that location with your exact path to the jvm, it should contain only one line (mine looks like /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/lib/i386
2009-05-08T10:21:00.000Z	ankur_	glitsj16	What should I name the file?
2009-05-08T10:22:00.000Z	glitsj16	ankur_	javapath.txt
2009-05-08T10:22:00.000Z	glitsj16	ankur_	correct, just the one
2009-05-08T10:24:00.000Z	glitsj16	ankur_	have you had time to check that link zvacet gave you ? about java-common (that has to be installed as well√†
2009-05-08T10:31:00.000Z	ankur_	glitsj16	zvacet, arvind_khadri, Thank You all! Thank you for bearing me all the time, when I had almost been bugging you.

2009-05-08T10:32:00.000Z	glitsj16	ankur_	okay, enjoy the class and the ubuntu, see you
