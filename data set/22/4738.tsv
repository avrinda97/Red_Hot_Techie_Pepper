2008-01-22T02:45:00.000Z	noo1		I have a strange problem that I am failing to resolve. Here on my ubuntu box I can grab pages that have recently been loaded by other pcs on my network. I couldn't connect to IRC, until I connected to the same network on my laptop, then after a few attempts I succeeded on my ubuntu box.  I can dig/ping any site out there from my ubuntu box, but I cant load pages that aren't in cache in FF.
2008-01-22T02:46:00.000Z	redguy	noo1	you have a proxy server running in your network?
2008-01-22T02:46:00.000Z	noo1	redguy	nope :-\
2008-01-22T02:47:00.000Z	redguy	noo1	well, it seems so
2008-01-22T02:48:00.000Z	noo1	redguy	i agree the symptoms would suggest that, but trust me i dont haev a proxy server running. do you have any other ideas of why this might happen?
2008-01-22T02:48:00.000Z	redguy	noo1	check firefox preferences (edit->preferences->advanced->network tab->settings button) and see if you don't have a proxy server configured
2008-01-22T02:49:00.000Z	noo1	redguy	checked, no proxy settings.
2008-01-22T02:51:00.000Z	noo1	redguy	so theres nothing set odd in FF, and I can ping/dig any site from term.  I don't know whats wrong here.
2008-01-22T02:51:00.000Z	redguy	noo1	tried any other browser? elins/lynx perhaps?
2008-01-22T02:52:00.000Z	redguy	noo1	ah, you say that not only http has problems
2008-01-22T02:52:00.000Z	redguy	noo1	maybe you have IPs messed up in your network?
2008-01-22T02:53:00.000Z	noo1	redguy	i have it set to DHCP, and it grabs a valid IP from my router which no other box is using
2008-01-22T02:53:00.000Z	redguy	noo1	hmmm
2008-01-22T02:54:00.000Z	redguy	noo1	seems very odd. Just to make sure - did you try to arping your IP ? This would detect duplicate IPs
2008-01-22T02:55:00.000Z	noo1	redguy	no, how do I do that
2008-01-22T02:57:00.000Z	redguy	noo1	try typing arping your_ip in the terminal
2008-01-22T02:57:00.000Z	redguy	noo1	install the arping(?) package if necessary
2008-01-22T02:58:00.000Z	redguy	noo1	what kind of LAN do you have? is it wifi?
2008-01-22T02:58:00.000Z	noo1	redguy	its ethernet, im running the arping and it said WARNING: interface is ignored, operation not permitted and on the next line it says arping
2008-01-22T02:59:00.000Z	redguy	noo1	sudo arping then
2008-01-22T03:00:00.000Z	noo1	redguy	no responses, sent 17 probes (17 broadcasts) 0 responses
2008-01-22T03:01:00.000Z	redguy	noo1	well that was an even further shot. No idea what could cause the symptoms you described.
