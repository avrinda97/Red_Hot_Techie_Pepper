2009-02-05T20:38:00.000Z	ikonia	jusama14_	there is no way that would go to sorceforce to download an exe
2009-02-05T20:39:00.000Z	jusama14_	ikonia	I think it's trying to download fonts
2009-02-05T20:39:00.000Z	ikonia	jusama14_	fonts are not .exe
2009-02-05T20:39:00.000Z	jusama14_	ikonia	yeah I really don't know what it's doing. What do you think?
2009-02-05T20:39:00.000Z	ikonia	jusama14_	I think you need to pastebin the whole of the error from the upgrade process
2009-02-05T20:40:00.000Z	ikonia	jusama14_	it should say what pacakge it's trying to update
2009-02-05T20:41:00.000Z	jusama14_	ikonia	here is the entire process - http://pastebin.com/m6ce5c0f9
2009-02-05T20:42:00.000Z	ikonia	jusama14_	windows fonts packages by the looks of that, what is the line before the one you started the paste with
2009-02-05T20:42:00.000Z	jusama14_	ikonia	that's as high as terminal goes.
2009-02-05T20:43:00.000Z	jusama14_	ikonia	I was running the same command. dist-upgrade
2009-02-05T20:43:00.000Z	ikonia	jusama14_	I'd look at "dpkg -l | grep font" find any packages that are referenced in this error and remove them before upgrade
2009-02-05T20:45:00.000Z	jusama14_	ikonia	several are listed -> http://pastebin.com/m7d76c136
2009-02-05T20:45:00.000Z	ikonia	jusama14_	msttcorefonts remove it
2009-02-05T20:45:00.000Z	ikonia	jusama14_	then check in the error to see if the error changes
2009-02-05T20:46:00.000Z	jusama14_	ikonia	so after removing it you want me to try an upgrade?
2009-02-05T20:46:00.000Z	ikonia	jusama14_	yup
2009-02-05T20:47:00.000Z	jusama14_	ikonia	I got this output while removing -> http://pastebin.com/m556a2f9d
2009-02-05T20:47:00.000Z	ikonia	jusama14_	that's ok
2009-02-05T20:48:00.000Z	jusama14_	ikonia	I think the dist-upgrade is working now
