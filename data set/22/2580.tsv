2009-05-03T20:34:00.000Z	tnt996		does anyone know anything about Ubuntu networking?
2009-05-03T20:35:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	What about networking? That's pretty broad.
2009-05-03T20:35:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	Connect to shared folders? To run the computer through remote desktop?...?
2009-05-03T20:36:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	Won't let you click on it? Meaning nothing happens when you do, or that it doesn't show up?
2009-05-03T20:39:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	Is this a password protected share?
2009-05-03T20:42:00.000Z	tnt996	vertagano	do you know what may be causeing this?
2009-05-03T20:42:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	I haven't tried to connect to Windows shares with the GUI before. Are you familiar with the command line?
2009-05-03T20:43:00.000Z	tnt996	vertagano	if you tell me the commands i can XD i know alot about command lines in windows so im sure i can try here
2009-05-03T20:43:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	Alright.
2009-05-03T20:44:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	First, make a folder somewhere to be our mount point.   mkdir ~/server
2009-05-03T20:44:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	Then connect to it:   mount.cifs //server/server ~/server
2009-05-03T20:47:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	That might be the problem... After you get that installed, the GUI might work.
2009-05-03T20:49:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	Is that a new message?
2009-05-03T20:49:00.000Z	tnt996	vertagano	no i got that before
2009-05-03T20:51:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	The command line to get the share list is:  smbclient -L //server
2009-05-03T20:51:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	See if that works.
2009-05-03T21:54:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	Can you play your music at a normal speed in other programs?
2009-05-03T21:55:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	Like mplayer, vlc, audacious?
2009-05-03T21:55:00.000Z	tnt996	vertagano	ill try
2009-05-03T21:56:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	Then it's probably a sound card driver problem.
2009-05-03T21:56:00.000Z	tnt996	vertagano	what can i do to fix this?
2009-05-03T21:57:00.000Z	vertagano	tnt996	You'll need to find out what your sound card is and then research the problem.
