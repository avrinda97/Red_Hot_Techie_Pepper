2009-05-12T19:07:00.000Z	devendra		any help?
2009-05-12T19:07:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	wrong ip: 192.168.1.1 you have typed it wrong
2009-05-12T19:12:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	I am too.  My router's IP is 192.168.1.1
2009-05-12T19:16:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	you are using the USB modem? or the Wifi one?
2009-05-12T19:19:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	are you typing the username and password correctly? no capslock, or anything like that?
2009-05-12T19:20:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	shadeslayer, it's admin/admin over here
2009-05-12T19:21:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	one thing you could do is log in on windows, save the settings to a file on the computer, reset the router, login on ubuntu using default username and password, and set up your settings as you like?  If it doesn't work, you cna go back towindows and restore your settings.
2009-05-12T19:37:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	are you connected to the router?
2009-05-12T19:38:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	please run the command ifconfig, and tell us what you get
2009-05-12T19:44:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	ifconfig?
2009-05-12T19:51:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	can you connect to the net in ubuntu, just not the router page?
2009-05-12T19:45:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	you're not connected to the network.
2009-05-12T19:47:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	what is your ethernet card? is it supported in ubuntu?
2009-05-12T19:48:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	I cant say supported or not.  I have no idea.  How old is it?
2009-05-12T19:51:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	so you have internet
2009-05-12T19:52:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	you are using the dialup connection.  This may be the problem.  You are actually bypassing the router, and going straight to the net on your machine
2009-05-12T19:53:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	I suggest you go to the router page on xp, and change the configuration from "bridge" to the first option
2009-05-12T19:53:00.000Z	devendra	swiftarrow	i have to reboot again to perform that
2009-05-12T19:54:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	I'm guessing here, but I think that the bridge might be the issue.
2009-05-12T19:55:00.000Z	swiftarrow	devendra	take a backup of settings first
