2007-01-26T08:10:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	check your log files
2007-01-26T08:10:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	are you runing wireless?
2007-01-26T08:11:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	sure you are not?
2007-01-26T08:11:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	systems logs /var/log
2007-01-26T08:12:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	it is hard to lock a linux system - only seems to happen with hardware drivers
2007-01-26T08:12:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	I assume you are experiencing a real lock requiring a reboot
2007-01-26T08:13:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	machine?
2007-01-26T08:13:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	laptop desktop?
2007-01-26T08:14:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	anyway it will be hard to track through logs - often people have to put debugging on in the kernel
2007-01-26T08:15:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	best way to work out what the problem area is understand what you are running when it happens
2007-01-26T08:16:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	now wirless drivers are not though
2007-01-26T08:16:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	and obvioulsy not all wireless drivers
2007-01-26T08:17:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	the rt2500 set is particularly good at locking a system
2007-01-26T08:22:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	lspic
2007-01-26T08:22:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	lspci
2007-01-26T08:24:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	that will show you the pci devices now you have not mentioned yet if this is a laptop or not
2007-01-26T08:24:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	there are usb embedded wireless often found in clevo style laptops
2007-01-26T08:25:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	so you may have to use lsusb instead
2007-01-26T08:27:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	well from my experince with these locks you end up having to wait on updated drivers - or old working drivers once oyu have determined what causes the problem
2007-01-26T08:32:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	try lusbs
2007-01-26T08:32:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	try lsusb (not sure how that s jumped)
2007-01-26T08:33:00.000Z	zention	tigafan09	the problem is very annoying when it happens so I understand your dilemma but you will have to dig around to solve this one
