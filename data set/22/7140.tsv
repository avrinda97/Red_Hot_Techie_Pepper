2006-12-11T08:25:00.000Z	whyameye		is there a way from the cmd line to find out the temp of my processor? Perhaps cat /proc/<something>/<something> sort of thing?
2006-12-11T08:26:00.000Z	SurfnKid	whyameye	the temp?
2006-12-11T08:26:00.000Z	whyameye	SurfnKid	yes the temp
2006-12-11T08:26:00.000Z	SurfnKid	whyameye	ohh temperature duh
2006-12-11T08:26:00.000Z	whyameye	SurfnKid	as in the temperature
2006-12-11T08:28:00.000Z	SurfnKid	whyameye	cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/*
2006-12-11T08:29:00.000Z	SurfnKid	whyameye	thats if yer machine supports acpi
2006-12-11T08:29:00.000Z	whyameye	SurfnKid	there's nothing in that directory, although the directory does exist. How did you find that, BTW?
2006-12-11T08:30:00.000Z	SurfnKid	whyameye	just remembered that I was setting up my acpi thermal sensor in the panel
2006-12-11T08:30:00.000Z	SurfnKid	whyameye	what does /proc/acpi contain?
2006-12-11T08:31:00.000Z	whyameye	SurfnKid	some files and directories...wading through them now...
2006-12-11T08:31:00.000Z	SurfnKid	whyameye	cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/*/* should give ya everything there
2006-12-11T08:34:00.000Z	SurfnKid	whyameye	then acpi isnt configured properly to read all those variables
2006-12-11T08:34:00.000Z	SurfnKid	whyameye	whats in /proc/acpi? anything
2006-12-11T08:36:00.000Z	SurfnKid	whyameye	pretty decent pc or old clunker?
2006-12-11T08:36:00.000Z	whyameye	SurfnKid	old clunker. 1.5 Gz PIV made for Win98.
2006-12-11T08:36:00.000Z	SurfnKid	whyameye	that might be why the acpi might not be reading well
2006-12-11T08:37:00.000Z	SurfnKid	whyameye	the mobo might support acpi but might have to load and mod stuff for the kernel
2006-12-11T08:37:00.000Z	whyameye	SurfnKid	I think I just won't worry about it for now. Next time I am in the room w/ the box I'll make sure the fans are spinning.
2006-12-11T08:37:00.000Z	SurfnKid	whyameye	whats the BIOS say? if the temp is normal there, dont worry
2006-12-11T08:37:00.000Z	whyameye	SurfnKid	the computer is housed in an area that's hard for me to get to. But I'll have to take a trip there tomorrow or something...
2006-12-11T08:38:00.000Z	SurfnKid	whyameye	oh ok
