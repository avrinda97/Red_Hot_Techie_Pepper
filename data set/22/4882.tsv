2011-01-14T05:13:00.000Z	s3a		Could someone please tell me if I can install Ubuntu on an Archos 5 Model: 501313
2011-01-14T05:13:00.000Z	neozen	s3a	that a laptop?
2011-01-14T05:14:00.000Z	s3a	neozen	^
2011-01-14T05:14:00.000Z	neozen	s3a	ah... tablet
2011-01-14T05:14:00.000Z	neozen	s3a	you might be able to... question is ... would you actually want to.
2011-01-14T05:15:00.000Z	s3a	neozen	i want to dual boot android with it
2011-01-14T05:15:00.000Z	neozen	s3a	stock ubuntu not exactly built (usability wise) for handheld tablets
2011-01-14T05:15:00.000Z	s3a	neozen	i don't want to replace android
2011-01-14T05:15:00.000Z	s3a	neozen	there is netbook edition
2011-01-14T05:15:00.000Z	s3a	neozen	and i don't mind heavy customization
2011-01-14T05:15:00.000Z	neozen	s3a	yes there is
2011-01-14T05:17:00.000Z	neozen	s3a	good luck.... I have no idea
2011-01-14T05:17:00.000Z	neozen	s3a	pretty sure I'd have a hell of a time using linux on something w/o a keyboard
2011-01-14T05:18:00.000Z	s3a	neozen	that's why i'm not removing android, i have certain softwares i want to use in ubuntu
2011-01-14T05:19:00.000Z	neozen	s3a	I hear you
2011-01-14T05:20:00.000Z	neozen	s3a	if I had a dime for every time I thought.... "WHY can I not just SCP on this G2" ..why must I either snag some paid (or crippled trial) app off the market or compile it myself
2011-01-14T05:22:00.000Z	s3a	neozen	well actually, i don't even have a cell phone
2011-01-14T05:22:00.000Z	s3a	neozen	i've never owned my own cell phone in my life and still don't plan to
2011-01-14T05:22:00.000Z	s3a	neozen	a portable cell-phone sized tablet would be good though, i can use skype via wifi for "cell phoning"
2011-01-14T05:23:00.000Z	neozen	s3a	since I got the g2.... I don't really call anyone... used about 30min last week...
2011-01-14T05:23:00.000Z	neozen	s3a	*month
2011-01-14T05:24:00.000Z	neozen	s3a	now the web-browser, the reddit app, and the rockbox alpha..... those're used non-stop
