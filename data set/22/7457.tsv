2006-03-27T06:43:00.000Z	brenner	shambling	pastebin it this time.  anyway, i gtg.  i'm sure someone can help you w/ that.  btw, mounting/unmounting should be done via the desktop icons or w/ mount/umount commands.  i'm not sure what the disks utility does, but i don't think that's the way you should be doing it
2006-03-27T06:43:00.000Z	shambling	brenner	okthanks m8
