2006-11-02T14:46:00.000Z	Puaff		please, does anyone know why I have and [m character after each bold text in man pages?
2006-11-02T14:46:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Puaff	incorrect TERM setting
2006-11-02T14:47:00.000Z	Puaff	Samus_Aran	I have xterm, is that wrong?
2006-11-02T14:48:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Puaff	no, but there is an option that tells Bash how to draw characters on the screen, that info is stored in the "TERM" variable.  if it has the wrong TERM variable, things will get messed up
2006-11-02T14:48:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Puaff	to see the current setting, you can go: echo $TERM
2006-11-02T14:49:00.000Z	Puaff	Samus_Aran	I've initialized TERM with linux and has worked fine, thank you very much
2006-11-02T14:49:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Puaff	if you are in an Xterm, it should probably be set to "xterm-color".  if it is set to "linux" or "vt220" or whatnot it may not have all the expected features
2006-11-02T14:50:00.000Z	Puaff	Samus_Aran	I'm using gterm
2006-11-02T14:50:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Puaff	okay, then it likely does want "linux"
2006-11-02T14:50:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Puaff	in the options menu for gterm you should be able to set the default TERM setting, so it won't forget it once you log out
2006-11-02T14:51:00.000Z	Puaff	Samus_Aran	do you know why there is a ospeed message with less, it is ugly
2006-11-02T14:51:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Puaff	can you explain what you mean ?
2006-11-02T14:52:00.000Z	Puaff	Samus_Aran	less: Symbol `ospeed' has different size in shared object, consider re-linking
2006-11-02T14:52:00.000Z	Puaff	Samus_Aran	it showed up the last ubuntu release
2006-11-02T14:54:00.000Z	Puaff	Samus_Aran	do you get the same warning?
2006-11-02T14:54:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Puaff	no.  I am on a fresh install of Ubuntu 6.06
2006-11-02T14:55:00.000Z	Puaff	Samus_Aran	I'm on 6.10 but in dapper I got the same
2006-11-02T14:55:00.000Z	Puaff	Samus_Aran	thank you very much for your help
2006-11-02T14:55:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Puaff	the linking error points to a shared library, not specifically less
2006-11-02T14:56:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	Puaff	you could check which libraries less uses, and see if you have updated any of them with non-standard versions
2006-11-02T14:56:00.000Z	Puaff	Samus_Aran	maybe is a man warning, I'm going to google it, just a sec
2006-11-02T15:02:00.000Z	Puaff	Samus_Aran	I find nothing, doesn't matter, it is just ugly but it is not a problem
