2007-11-30T05:17:00.000Z	hacked_kernel		I got Ubuntu Gutsy and I heard that I have to recompile the kernel for P4, is it right?
2007-11-30T05:19:00.000Z	Evanlec	hacked_kernel	no recompiling is necessary
2007-11-30T05:20:00.000Z	hacked_kernel	Evanlec	I know that its not necessary to do it but to get the P4 optimization for more speed
2007-11-30T05:21:00.000Z	Evanlec	hacked_kernel	well, u could do that, what generation pentium 4 is it? HT?
2007-11-30T05:22:00.000Z	hacked_kernel	Evanlec	Its pentium M "centrino", HT
2007-11-30T05:22:00.000Z	hacked_kernel	Evanlec	sorry i mean no HT
2007-11-30T05:22:00.000Z	Evanlec	hacked_kernel	mkay...well there is some flags in the 2.6.23 kernel for that processor, but unless ur up for a bit of learning, u might forget about it
2007-11-30T05:23:00.000Z	Evanlec	hacked_kernel	if you're interested in compiling your own kernel tho i recommend this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=311158
2007-11-30T05:24:00.000Z	hacked_kernel	Evanlec	do you think the result worse it?
2007-11-30T05:24:00.000Z	Evanlec	hacked_kernel	?
2007-11-30T05:26:00.000Z	hacked_kernel	Evanlec	do you think that this operation will result in much more noticeable speed?
2007-11-30T05:28:00.000Z	Evanlec	hacked_kernel	to be honest, from what i've read, the difference wil probably be less than noticeable, however there are other options when compling your kernel to boost performance
2007-11-30T05:28:00.000Z	hacked_kernel	Evanlec	thanks a lot
2007-11-30T05:29:00.000Z	Evanlec	hacked_kernel	yea, if ur interested, read up on kernel scheduler settings and the 'realtime' kernel
2007-11-30T05:32:00.000Z	hacked_kernel	Evanlec	do you know about hard disk load cycle?
2007-11-30T05:32:00.000Z	Evanlec	hacked_kernel	mm...not sure what u mean
2007-11-30T05:33:00.000Z	hacked_kernel	Evanlec	hard disk load cycle is parking/un parking the hard disk's head to save power when running on battery
2007-11-30T05:34:00.000Z	hacked_kernel	Evanlec	each hard disk manufacturar sets an average for its product
2007-11-30T05:34:00.000Z	hacked_kernel	Evanlec	the average is 600,000 load cycle then you should replace your hard disk
2007-11-30T05:34:00.000Z	Evanlec	hacked_kernel	ohh right, well im not too sure about that as i dont use a laptop currently
2007-11-30T05:35:00.000Z	hacked_kernel	Evanlec	ubuntu makes a lot of this cycles per minute more than other OS's
2007-11-30T05:37:00.000Z	Evanlec	hacked_kernel	i've heard some about that, but i dont know how to fix it
