2011-10-26T18:54:00.000Z	meta-coder	ActionParsnip	It was fine the second time I logged in. But why is this happening?
2011-10-26T18:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meta-coder	test ram would be my first call dude, then make a new user. If it is bad as the new user then its the apps. If it is ok then your user settings are causing the issue
