2008-05-26T00:29:00.000Z	PaRaSiTe		I tried this, but it didn't work: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto#head-4c7a8640a439568ee312c9f262cc1099634f25ef
2008-05-26T00:30:00.000Z	PaRaSiTe		Has anyone tried this? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto#head-1296ce2b184032373f19ad50a91d506eb886ac5f It doesn't sound very... safe.
2008-05-26T00:30:00.000Z	Flannel	PaRaSiTe	it's perfectly safe
2008-05-26T00:31:00.000Z	Flannel	PaRaSiTe	You just need to reinstall stage1, right?  Windows knocked it out?
2008-05-26T00:32:00.000Z	PaRaSiTe	Flannel	I don't really understand.  All I know is I followed those instructions to the letter, all seemed to work, but when I booted I jsut got the normal Windows one.
2008-05-26T00:33:00.000Z	Flannel	PaRaSiTe	That page solves a different problm than theone you have.  You want this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2008-05-26T00:37:00.000Z	PaRaSiTe	Flannel	That page has the same solution. ;)
2008-05-26T00:38:00.000Z	PaRaSiTe	Flannel	Oh wait, I need the second part...
2008-05-26T00:38:00.000Z	PaRaSiTe	Flannel	Can't I just reinstall Ubuntu? :P
2008-05-26T00:39:00.000Z	Flannel	PaRaSiTe	Er... it has the same way... at the very bottom.  Do the first method or the second.
2008-05-26T00:39:00.000Z	Flannel	PaRaSiTe	you *could* install Ubuntu, but you'd... well, have to reinstall Ubuntu
2008-05-26T00:40:00.000Z	PaRaSiTe	Flannel	I mean the instruction from the GrubHowTo page.
2008-05-26T00:42:00.000Z	Flannel	PaRaSiTe	Right.  The only one that is the same is the *last* set of instructions on the RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows page.  Do one of ht eones at the top
2008-05-26T00:42:00.000Z	PaRaSiTe	Flannel	OK.  Like "Overwriting the Windows bootloader"?
2008-05-26T00:43:00.000Z	Flannel	PaRaSiTe	right.
2008-05-26T00:44:00.000Z	PaRaSiTe	Flannel	That one is confusing me, they keep changing which HDA they're talking about. :-/
2008-05-26T00:47:00.000Z	Flannel	PaRaSiTe	thats because they're taking you through how to figure out which partition has /boot on it.  If you only have one Ubuntu partition, that would be it.
2008-05-26T00:47:00.000Z	PaRaSiTe	Flannel	I have one for / and one for /home (and swap space)
2008-05-26T00:48:00.000Z	Flannel	PaRaSiTe	then it'll be the one for /
2008-05-26T00:48:00.000Z	PaRaSiTe	Flannel	I understand the first part.  Is it always ext3 though, or ext2 if it's ext2?  And for the final bit, is it always just hda?
2008-05-26T00:48:00.000Z	Flannel	PaRaSiTe	the final bit is always hda, because that's the MBR we want to change.  And yeah, if you have ext2 it wouldn't be ext3
2008-05-26T00:49:00.000Z	PaRaSiTe	Flannel	OK, get it I think.  Wish me luck! :D
