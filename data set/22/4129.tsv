2008-04-28T15:48:00.000Z	blue-frog	microwaver	problem with b43 wifi?
2008-04-28T15:48:00.000Z	microwaver	blue-frog	i'm at http://wireless.kernel.org/ and don't really know witch to choose :)
2008-04-28T15:51:00.000Z	blue-frog	microwaver	I assume you tried /system/administration/hardware drivers already?
2008-04-28T15:51:00.000Z	microwaver	blue-frog	not totally following you there. :)
2008-04-28T15:52:00.000Z	blue-frog	microwaver	on your menubar click system/administration/hardware drivers
2008-04-28T15:53:00.000Z	microwaver	blue-frog	don't go a Hardware Drivers sections under there :)
2008-04-28T15:54:00.000Z	microwaver	blue-frog	do you mean Hardware Information?
2008-04-28T15:55:00.000Z	blue-frog	microwaver	if you are using ubuntu 8.04, you should have a menu called "hardware drivers" if running 7.10 then it is restricted drivers
2008-04-28T15:55:00.000Z	microwaver	blue-frog	it is not listed in Restricted Drivers, I'm running 7.10
2008-04-28T15:56:00.000Z	blue-frog	microwaver	using ndiswrapper should work then (using your windows drivers to make it run under linux)
2008-04-28T15:58:00.000Z	blue-frog	microwaver	yes
2008-04-28T15:59:00.000Z	microwaver	blue-frog	let's try that once more.
2008-04-28T16:07:00.000Z	blue-frog	microwaver	you're ok with ndis or need help?
2008-04-28T16:07:00.000Z	microwaver	blue-frog	just did 'install it' ndiswrapper-common, ndiswrapper-utils-1-9 do I need the modules as well?
2008-04-28T16:08:00.000Z	blue-frog	microwaver	/join #bluefrog   will be esaier for 2 minutes
2008-04-28T16:09:00.000Z	microwaver	blue-frog	see you there :)
2008-04-28T16:20:00.000Z	microwaver	blue-frog	you still there.
2008-04-28T16:21:00.000Z	blue-frog	microwaver	yes
2008-04-28T16:22:00.000Z	microwaver	blue-frog	sorry to bother you, but witch driver should I choose. the bulk package or the single driver?
2008-04-28T16:23:00.000Z	blue-frog	microwaver	single I believe
2008-04-28T16:23:00.000Z	blue-frog	microwaver	take them all...
2008-04-28T16:24:00.000Z	microwaver	blue-frog	Kay :)
