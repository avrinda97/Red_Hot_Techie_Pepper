2005-07-26T07:32:00.000Z	pschulz01_		Can I extract my details in a 'vcard' format somehow?
2005-07-26T07:32:00.000Z	bob2	pschulz01_	perhaps try #evolution on irc.gnome.org
2005-07-26T07:33:00.000Z	pschulz01_	bob2	cheers
2005-07-26T07:54:00.000Z	pschulz01_	bob2	regarding 'vcards'.
2005-07-26T07:54:00.000Z	bob2	pschulz01_	?
2005-07-26T07:54:00.000Z	pschulz01_	bob2	the #evolution channel was very quiet... (ie. nobody talking)
2005-07-26T07:55:00.000Z	pschulz01_	bob2	You can drag and drop from address boot to emails!
2005-07-26T07:55:00.000Z	pschulz01_	bob2	You can drag and drop from address book to emails!
2005-07-26T07:55:00.000Z	bob2	pschulz01_	and I can hit three keys in mutt to do the same
2005-07-26T07:56:00.000Z	pschulz01_	bob2	I was asked to supply a vcard to a linux friendly company who is going to supply me wich cheep hardware,,\
2005-07-26T07:56:00.000Z	bob2	pschulz01_	ok!
2005-07-26T07:56:00.000Z	bob2	pschulz01_	I don't know where else to ask then, try the evolution user list
2005-07-26T07:56:00.000Z	pschulz01_	bob2	I found out what I wanted...
2005-07-26T07:59:00.000Z	pschulz01_	bob2	cheers, thanks for the pointers...
2005-10-12T08:21:00.000Z	bob2	pschulz01_	install build-essential, kernel-package and fakeroot
2005-10-12T08:22:00.000Z	pschulz01_	bob2	Cheers...
2005-10-12T08:23:00.000Z	pschulz01_	bob2	I'm having problems with 'make gconfig'..
2005-10-12T08:23:00.000Z	bob2	pschulz01_	then don't do that
2005-10-12T08:23:00.000Z	bob2	pschulz01_	or install libgtk2.0-dev
2005-10-12T08:25:00.000Z	pschulz01_	bob2	have that.. found the problem. I needed 'libglademm2.0-dev'. (Or one of it's dependancies)
2005-10-12T08:26:00.000Z	pschulz01_	bob2	Found it via: "apt-cache search  glade 2.0 | grep dev"
2005-10-12T08:26:00.000Z	bob2	pschulz01_	erk
