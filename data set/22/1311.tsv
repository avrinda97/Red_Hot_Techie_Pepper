2010-07-03T06:46:00.000Z	wodKa		is one of those the current version of x.org?
2010-07-03T06:47:00.000Z	wodKa		that's on the driver page for the mobility 4000-series driver
2010-07-03T06:47:00.000Z	soreau	wodKa	Why are you trying to install fglrx?
2010-07-03T06:47:00.000Z	soreau	wodKa	On 10.04, the radeon driver should already be working
2010-07-03T06:50:00.000Z	soreau	wodKa	Can you show the output of 'glxinfo|grep renderer'?
2010-07-03T06:51:00.000Z	soreau	wodKa	Please use my nick in what you say so I get highlighted here
2010-07-03T06:51:00.000Z	wodKa	soreau	sure sorry
2010-07-03T06:52:00.000Z	soreau	wodKa	So it tells you which package provides glxinfo and you're installing it, right?
2010-07-03T06:53:00.000Z	wodKa	soreau	yes apparently i have to add universe or something, im looking for it
2010-07-03T06:53:00.000Z	soreau	wodKa	see sys>admin>software sources
2010-07-03T06:53:00.000Z	soreau	wodKa	You can check all five main repos are enabled
2010-07-03T06:53:00.000Z	wodKa	soreau	it's installing
2010-07-03T06:54:00.000Z	wodKa	soreau	OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI R600 (RV630 9581) 20090101 x86/MMX/SSE2 TCL DRI2
2010-07-03T06:55:00.000Z	soreau	wodKa	Ok, does /etc/X11/xorg.conf exist?
2010-07-03T06:56:00.000Z	wodKa	soreau	no
2010-07-03T06:58:00.000Z	soreau	wodKa	How long do these 'stops' happen and can you re-describe your problem in detail?
2010-07-03T07:00:00.000Z	wodKa	soreau	happens after 10 seconds to a minute or so of inactivity, everything on the screen freezes and processes stop (wifi shuts off, music stops playing, etc) indefinitely until i press a key, move the mouse, flip the wifi button off and on, anything. i put a video of it on youtube if you want to see it in action, its pretty much just that description though.
2010-07-03T07:01:00.000Z	wodKa	soreau	it has happened since 9.04, 9.10, and now 10.04. 8.04 and 8.10 worked great back when i used those.
2010-07-03T07:02:00.000Z	wodKa	soreau	it's on a gateway m-153xl laptop, tried both 32 and 64-bit versions as well
2010-07-03T07:04:00.000Z	soreau	wodKa	ok, sounds like a kernel/driver/module bug. So this has always happened on the same machine, right? Do 'lsmod' then start blacklisting modules starting with the obvious problematic ones like wifi and video, then maybe even some audio driver or any other strange module could cause the issue
2010-07-03T07:06:00.000Z	wodKa	soreau	how do you blacklist modules?
2010-07-03T07:12:00.000Z	wodKa	soreau	ran out of time to play with this tonight, thanks for your help
