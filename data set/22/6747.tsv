2006-11-23T08:06:00.000Z	txx2		guys, can someone please send me a default xorg.conf please?
2006-11-23T08:07:00.000Z	simmerz	txx2	have you tried running X --config as root?
2006-11-23T08:08:00.000Z	txx2	simmerz	 I'm currently using mepis becaue I'm basically locked out of ubuntu. I edited the xorg.conf and it kicks me out every time.
2006-11-23T08:08:00.000Z	simmerz	txx2	what are the errors?
2006-11-23T08:08:00.000Z	txx2	simmerz	 can't remember, but I get a blue box in the middle saying that something has gone wrong
2006-11-23T08:09:00.000Z	simmerz	txx2	need to know that "something
2006-11-23T08:09:00.000Z	simmerz	txx2	look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2006-11-23T08:09:00.000Z	txx2	simmerz	 for some strange reason, mepis doesn't like mounting ubuntu
2006-11-23T08:10:00.000Z	simmerz	txx2	is ubuntu installed on an ext3 partition?
2006-11-23T08:10:00.000Z	txx2	simmerz	 yeah
2006-11-23T08:10:00.000Z	simmerz	txx2	mount -t ext3 /dev/hdX /mnt/ubuntu (or wherever)
2006-11-23T08:11:00.000Z	simmerz	txx2	if you're using SATA then /dev/sdX
2006-11-23T08:11:00.000Z	txx2	simmerz	 using laptop, it's ide.
2006-11-23T08:11:00.000Z	simmerz	txx2	ok. so probably hda1 then
2006-11-23T08:16:00.000Z	simmerz	txx2	the Xorg.0.log will tell you what is wrong when it tries to run x.org. resolve that error, and you'll be away
2006-11-23T08:16:00.000Z	txx2	simmerz	 I have the log, where is that website to post clipboards?
2006-11-23T08:17:00.000Z	simmerz	txx2	rafb.net/paste
2006-11-23T08:19:00.000Z	simmerz	txx2	sort out those font dirs as a first thing. but they are warnings, not major
2006-11-23T08:19:00.000Z	txx2	simmerz	 Not a professional over here unfortunately :P
2006-11-23T08:22:00.000Z	simmerz	txx2	what is the exact error you get?
2006-11-23T08:23:00.000Z	simmerz	txx2	might be useful
