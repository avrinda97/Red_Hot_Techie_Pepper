2007-09-24T16:07:00.000Z	bluebanana		guys, how can i have a music player start playing an mp3 file at X:YZ PM?
2007-09-24T16:07:00.000Z	bluebanana		Using terminal is fine with me.
2007-09-24T16:07:00.000Z	bluebanana		(I'm going to use it as an alarm clock)
2007-09-24T16:07:00.000Z	soundray	bluebanana	gnome-open file.mp3 | at x.yz
2007-09-24T16:07:00.000Z	soundray	bluebanana	use 24 hour notation
2007-09-24T16:08:00.000Z	bluebanana	soundray	that's it? looks pretty easy, even for a ubu-baby like me
2007-09-24T16:09:00.000Z	soundray	bluebanana	what's difficult (sometimes) is to find out how to do things like that.
2007-09-24T16:10:00.000Z	bluebanana	soundray	yeah.
2007-09-24T16:11:00.000Z	bluebanana	soundray	it also works for a playlist, yes?
2007-09-24T16:15:00.000Z	bluebanana	soundray	i tried your command, but the program opens up and starts immediately
2007-09-24T16:16:00.000Z	soundray	bluebanana	I see -- I thought it would work with gnome-open, but it doesn't. Use a command line mp3 player like mpg321
2007-09-24T16:16:00.000Z	bluebanana	soundray	i tried totem, and totem works/plays the music, but it does so now, and not later
2007-09-24T16:17:00.000Z	soundray	bluebanana	mplayer -loop
2007-09-24T16:21:00.000Z	bluebanana	soundray	 mplayer foo.mp3 | at 15:22 makes the music start now. and not later. are you sure you have the right command/syntax?
2007-09-24T16:24:00.000Z	soundray	bluebanana	the syntax is right, but it works with some programs, but not others.
2007-09-24T16:24:00.000Z	bluebanana	soundray	the syntax you gave me is the reverse of what jrib gives me
2007-09-24T16:25:00.000Z	soundray	bluebanana	I've just tested jrib's and mine -- with mplayer jrib's is best.
2007-09-24T16:25:00.000Z	bluebanana	soundray	how do i do your syntax?
2007-09-24T16:26:00.000Z	soundray	bluebanana	with a different player program. Try mpg321
2007-09-24T16:27:00.000Z	soundray	bluebanana	atq to view, atrm number to remove
2007-09-24T16:27:00.000Z	bluebanana	soundray	thanks. you r good
2007-09-24T16:31:00.000Z	soundray	bluebanana	it's probably time to read some mplayer documentation. Check out 'man mplayer' and the stuff in /usr/share/doc/mplayer/
