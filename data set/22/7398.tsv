2007-09-23T11:02:00.000Z	darx		I tried installing kubuntu-destop over ubuntu and during the installation, package configuration asks me about default display manage. How can i set up gutys such that kdm start for kde and gdm for gnome?
2007-09-23T11:03:00.000Z	dystopianray	darx	that doesn't make any sense
2007-09-23T11:03:00.000Z	darx	dystopianray	why?
2007-09-23T11:03:00.000Z	dystopianray	darx	gdm or kdm are started before you login to gnome or kde
2007-09-23T11:04:00.000Z	dystopianray	darx	it has no idea which one you're going to use
2007-09-23T11:04:00.000Z	dystopianray	darx	you use one or the other and login to either gnome or kde as you please
2007-09-23T11:05:00.000Z	darx	dystopianray	then why does it say this  Multiple display managers can run simultaneously if they are configured  to manage different servers; to achieve this, configure the display managers accordingly, edit each of their init scripts in /etc/init.d,  and disable the check for a default display manager.
2007-09-23T11:05:00.000Z	dystopianray	darx	you want to run multiple X servers?
2007-09-23T11:06:00.000Z	dystopianray	darx	just pick either gdm or kdm and use only one X server
2007-09-23T11:06:00.000Z	darx	dystopianray	I need to try KDE4 so what do you think should I do?
2007-09-23T11:06:00.000Z	dystopianray	darx	using kde4 has nothing to do with your choice between kdm and gdm
2007-09-23T11:07:00.000Z	dystopianray	darx	pick either gdm or kdm and login to whatever you want through the session menu
2007-09-23T11:07:00.000Z	darx	dystopianray	and what are the advantages/disadvantages. If it's got nothing to do with it then why are there 2 displaymanagers in the first place?
2007-09-23T11:07:00.000Z	dystopianray	darx	one comes with gnome the other comes with kde
2007-09-23T11:07:00.000Z	dystopianray	darx	they both have equivalent funcionality
2007-09-23T11:07:00.000Z	dystopianray	darx	just pick your favourite
2007-09-23T11:09:00.000Z	darx	dystopianray	thanks for the info.. I really appreciate your prompt help.
2007-09-23T11:09:00.000Z	dystopianray	darx	if you are following a guide that tells you to run two X servers, one with kdm and one with gdm, then I'd recommend ignoring that guide as that is totally ridiculous
2007-09-23T11:11:00.000Z	darx	dystopianray	the guide comes with the default configuration when you try to install kubuntu-desktop
2007-09-23T11:11:00.000Z	darx	dystopianray	its more of a directive than a guide
2007-09-23T11:11:00.000Z	dystopianray	darx	installing kubuntu-desktop gives you two X servers?
2007-09-23T11:12:00.000Z	darx	dystopianray	no it's just a directive. it goes like "you can do this if you chose to and if you need to do this at init.d.."
