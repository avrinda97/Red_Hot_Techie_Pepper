2006-02-27T10:01:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	try smart boot manager perhaps, if the cd won't boot at all (and you have a floppy drive)
2006-02-27T10:03:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	more info
2006-02-27T10:04:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	what problem?
2006-02-27T10:07:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	so it could not be that - 2200 seems to cause no probs

2006-02-27T10:12:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	I have not seen this problem, so I don't have much idea - dod you look at linux-laptop.net and/or tuxmobil.org?
2006-02-27T10:14:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	I have no idea
2006-02-27T10:14:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	no one else reported such problems that you found?
2006-02-27T10:15:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	perhaps you can disable the card in the BIOS?
2006-02-27T10:15:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	or power it off with a Fn-key-combo?
2006-02-27T10:16:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	what model is the laptop?
2006-02-27T10:25:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	you don't? so wtf is it loading the module?
2006-02-27T10:25:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	sorry, I was afk
2006-02-27T10:29:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	how bizarre - hast thou googled assiduously?
2006-02-27T10:31:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	one day? that's not much ;)
2006-02-27T10:31:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	what is the exact model?
2006-02-27T10:40:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	perhaps try enabling it
2006-02-27T12:33:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	no idea, have a look at the options
2006-02-27T12:34:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	remove the minipci card? ;)
2006-02-27T12:36:00.000Z	amphi	abhinav12383	not that I know of; removing it is usually just one screw AFAIK
