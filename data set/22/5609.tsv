2008-10-04T21:47:00.000Z	orogor		hi, anyone knows where the defualt ubuntu iptable config is stored ?
2008-10-04T21:47:00.000Z	Ali_ix	orogor	no default setting afaik
2008-10-04T21:47:00.000Z	Ali_ix	orogor	check current rules by sudo iptables -L
2008-10-04T21:48:00.000Z	orogor	Ali_ix	seems empty
2008-10-04T21:49:00.000Z	Ali_ix	orogor	so you have no rules at all
2008-10-04T21:49:00.000Z	orogor	Ali_ix	seems weirdo to me to have it running with no rules
2008-10-04T21:49:00.000Z	orogor	Ali_ix	but on the default install ..
2008-10-04T21:49:00.000Z	Ali_ix	orogor	try firestarter or ufw
2008-10-04T21:49:00.000Z	orogor	Ali_ix	ufw ?
2008-10-04T21:49:00.000Z	Ali_ix	orogor	ubuntu default firewall, there is also a simple GUI for it: gufw
2008-10-04T21:49:00.000Z	orogor	Ali_ix	firestart gives some weirdo error saying that the inerface isn t ready,
2008-10-04T21:50:00.000Z	Ali_ix	orogor	check prefrences for local and internet interfaces.  btw, firestarter is a dead project, try something else
2008-10-04T21:55:00.000Z	orogor	Ali_ix	cool  that s  a goood simple soft
2008-10-04T21:55:00.000Z	orogor	Ali_ix	is there a way i can see the blocked connection or troggered loggings?
2008-10-04T21:55:00.000Z	Ali_ix	orogor	it is designed to be simple and powerfull, enjoy :)
2008-10-04T21:56:00.000Z	Ali_ix	orogor	not sure aboyt logging, look /var/log/ for something familiar
2008-10-04T21:56:00.000Z	orogor	Ali_ix	it s  rather primitive compared to a direct access to iptable , but i don t feells like messign with iptable for my home computer
2008-10-04T22:00:00.000Z	orogor	Ali_ix	thanks a lot , i have a static ip since yesterday, in the 5 min  installed ufw i already got some weidro connections blocked
2008-10-04T22:00:00.000Z	orogor	Ali_ix	just configured it to block incoming connections that was enought :)
2008-10-04T22:01:00.000Z	Ali_ix	orogor	cool, since i am behind a linksys router, i dont play around local firewalls, but should try UFW once :)
2008-10-04T22:08:00.000Z	orogor	Ali_ix	you know if there s a default profile for apparmor or if there s a  guyi for it as well ?
2008-10-04T22:21:00.000Z	Ali_ix	orogor	afaik, there is no gui for apparmor, and i am not much into its rules/configs
