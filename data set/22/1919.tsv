2010-02-19T03:27:00.000Z	Wispring		I need help getting TwinView working properly. Is anyone available to help me out?
2010-02-19T03:28:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Wispring	did you install your drivers yet?
2010-02-19T03:30:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Wispring	what drivers did you get?
2010-02-19T03:31:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Wispring	try pressing alt+F2
2010-02-19T03:32:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Wispring	then put in your password.
2010-02-19T03:33:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Wispring	I said to put gksudo nvidia-settings
2010-02-19T03:36:00.000Z	Wispring	SpaceGhostC2C	I have run this alot in the past 2 days.says I don't have the drivers
2010-02-19T03:36:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Wispring	have you restarted since installing the drivers?>
2010-02-19T03:38:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Wispring	then I want you to remove the current nvidia drivers. Press Alt+F2 and type, gksudo jockey-gtk
2010-02-19T03:40:00.000Z	Wispring	SpaceGhostC2C	ok, now the Hardware drivers dialog comes up that I used to install the drivers in the first place
2010-02-19T03:42:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Wispring	now remove the current drivers and go to http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index5.aspx?lang=en-us and get the drivers you need.
2010-02-19T03:42:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Wispring	I'll help you after you've got those drivers.
2010-02-19T03:43:00.000Z	Wispring	SpaceGhostC2C	thought I could use the nvidia-glx-new ones
2010-02-19T03:44:00.000Z	Wispring	SpaceGhostC2C	these aren't going to work then?
2010-02-19T03:44:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Wispring	you will be. But it'll be the ones from nvidia. I've had problems with the silly repo ones.
2010-02-19T03:57:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Wispring	now, you need to press Alt+f2 then type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop Then log into the terminal and go to where you downloaded the drivers. Type chmod +x Nvi* then type ./Nvi{Tab}
2010-02-19T03:58:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Wispring	if anything breaks, in the terminal type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
2010-02-19T04:03:00.000Z	Wispring	SpaceGhostC2C	hit enter after Nvi* or ./Nvi{Tab} or enter after both?
2010-02-19T04:03:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Wispring	then do this ./Nvi*
2010-02-19T04:04:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Wispring	but do it in the folder the file is in.
2010-02-19T04:16:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Wispring	in a terminal type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2010-02-19T04:51:00.000Z	Wispring	SpaceGhostC2C	ok I got to work once the drivers were installed..thanks for your help : )))
