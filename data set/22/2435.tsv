2009-06-10T22:34:00.000Z	TimeToChoose		Can anyone spare some time to help me get my distro working again before i go and try fedora 11
2009-06-10T22:34:00.000Z	anodesni	TimeToChoose	what's your problem
2009-06-10T22:35:00.000Z	anodesni	TimeToChoose	did you try ctrl+alt+F1 to enter tty ? To see if the boot process works
2009-06-10T22:36:00.000Z	TimeToChoose	anodesni	yes to no prevail
2009-06-10T22:36:00.000Z	anodesni	TimeToChoose	wubi is not the same as vbox
2009-06-10T22:37:00.000Z	TimeToChoose	anodesni	what is it then... i couldn't understand from their site
2009-06-10T22:37:00.000Z	anodesni	TimeToChoose	but it might cause the problem, it installs ubuntu alongside windows on the same partition (ntfs) which is not native linux file system
2009-06-10T22:38:00.000Z	anodesni	TimeToChoose	yes, it slows down the system, but only a little bit, almost not noticable
2009-06-10T22:38:00.000Z	TimeToChoose	anodesni	back to the problem at hand though (sorry slightly add) any ideas on waht I can do, or should i just give up and reinstall
2009-06-10T22:39:00.000Z	anodesni	TimeToChoose	if the system really does not boot, it might have to do something with ext4 filesystem. Did you use that?
2009-06-10T22:42:00.000Z	TimeToChoose	anodesni	i think it iwll just be easier if i reinstall it, how do i make sure i use the full 15 gigs i allocated
2009-06-10T22:42:00.000Z	anodesni	TimeToChoose	what do you mean I allocated 15 gig?
2009-06-10T22:42:00.000Z	anodesni	TimeToChoose	did you leave blank space on your hdd
2009-06-10T22:43:00.000Z	TimeToChoose	anodesni	I paritioned 15 or 17 gigs or something for linux, i am currenlty on my vista partition
2009-06-10T22:43:00.000Z	anodesni	TimeToChoose	what partitions did you make on the 15 gig?
2009-06-10T22:44:00.000Z	TimeToChoose	anodesni	I don't remember ext3 or ext4 or somehing
2009-06-10T22:45:00.000Z	anodesni	TimeToChoose	you say you want to use all 15 gig, so I ask what partitions you've made. If all partitions sum up to 15 gig...
2009-06-10T22:46:00.000Z	TimeToChoose	anodesni	oh my hdd is 320 gb 17 for ubuntu
2009-06-10T22:46:00.000Z	anodesni	TimeToChoose	then that's fine
2009-06-10T22:47:00.000Z	anodesni	TimeToChoose	it's you're nvidia driver then
2009-06-10T22:50:00.000Z	TimeToChoose	anodesni	I have ati card
2009-06-10T22:50:00.000Z	anodesni	TimeToChoose	ok
