2005-03-13T08:39:00.000Z	membreya	plagerism	what do you mean WHERE it originates from ?
2005-03-13T08:40:00.000Z	plagerism	membreya	what project
2005-03-13T08:46:00.000Z	membreya	plagerism	:)
2005-03-13T08:49:00.000Z	plagerism	membreya	just found it on the merliat repository, thanks membreya
2005-03-30T08:46:00.000Z	membreya	plagerism	I haven't even got my MM keys working :|
2005-03-30T08:46:00.000Z	plagerism	membreya	I had them working perfectly before the upgrade, on my keyboard and on my ATI remote control!!
2005-03-30T08:48:00.000Z	membreya	plagerism	have you tried going into keyboard shortcuts, I just did then and it mapped them perfectly
2005-03-30T08:48:00.000Z	plagerism	membreya	thats not where the problem lies, When I hit the key mapped to volume control the box comes up, however it doesnt change the volume
2005-03-30T08:56:00.000Z	plagerism	membreya	yea you use gconf-editor, however I cant remember the exact location of the key
2005-03-30T09:05:00.000Z	plagerism	membreya	havent had a windows partition for 5 years now, and I couldnt be happier.  Anything i need to do in Windows I can do in VMWARE!!
2005-03-30T09:05:00.000Z	membreya	plagerism	only thing I need windows for is transcoding Xvid files to mpeg2 so I can burn them to DVD .. I'm too lazy right now to learn how to do it in linux
2005-03-30T09:06:00.000Z	plagerism	membreya	why not use Transcode?? Much faster
2005-03-30T09:06:00.000Z	membreya	plagerism	read above :)
2005-03-30T09:07:00.000Z	plagerism	membreya	its actually not that hard, I was quite surprised myself
2005-03-30T09:07:00.000Z	membreya	plagerism	wanna give me the command line to transcode xvid to mpeg 2 ? :)
2005-03-30T09:09:00.000Z	plagerism	membreya	here is a nice little tutorial for authoring dvds with menus even http://mightylegends.zapto.org/dvd/dvdauthor_howto.php
2005-03-30T09:09:00.000Z	plagerism	membreya	the command is the same for all types of videos
2005-03-30T09:10:00.000Z	plagerism	membreya	here is a nice little script to do it as well http://sourceforge.net/projects/divxtodvd/. it ussually needs some tweaking, but it works in most instances that I have used it!!
2005-03-30T09:11:00.000Z	membreya	plagerism	xvid..not divx :P
2005-03-30T09:11:00.000Z	plagerism	membreya	divx/xvid all the same stuff
2005-03-30T09:11:00.000Z	plagerism	membreya	same commands to do it all
