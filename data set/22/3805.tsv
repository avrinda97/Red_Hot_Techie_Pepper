2008-05-26T19:11:00.000Z	dunken		Just installed the core system here with ubuntu server edition , but when booting up the system he dosent start the os ,
2008-05-26T19:11:00.000Z	dunken		it just stops just after bios check , if i then remove all hds exept bootdisk it works
2008-05-26T19:11:00.000Z	dunken		Any idea why it behaves like this ?
2008-05-26T19:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	dunken	check bios setting for boot devices
2008-05-26T19:12:00.000Z	dunken	erUSUL	ive doubled checked that , its the same hd that ubuntu is installed on
2008-05-26T19:29:00.000Z	dunken	erUSUL	You dont have any other hints why its behaving like that ?
2008-05-26T19:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	dunken	nope sorry
2008-05-26T19:33:00.000Z	dunken	erUSUL	Strange thing is it seems to work just fine if i install the system with only 1 hd in the system , ?
2008-05-26T19:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	dunken	i have a similar problem... i had to install the system with one hd (main sata) and with the others the other (pata) dettached for grub to install without problems
2008-05-26T19:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	dunken	but the system didn't get stuck grub just failed
2008-05-26T19:37:00.000Z	dunken	erUSUL	okie , did try to install it last night as well with only 1 hd , it works but then when adding more hds into the system it fails to boot up ?
2008-05-26T19:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	dunken	not for me after installation i added the other hd's and worked fine since then
2008-05-26T19:39:00.000Z	dunken	erUSUL	and u just installed grub like normal ?
2008-05-26T19:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	dunken	yes during installation (livecd) grub installed just fine. It was failing becouse it was being installed in one of the patadrives instead on the sata one. Once the only disk was the sata one grub installed just fine and in the bios my sata is firsdt boot device so everything works ok
2008-05-26T20:14:00.000Z	dunken	erUSUL	did a new install here , and it seems that he writes the grub into hdb , there could be the problem i guess
2008-05-26T20:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	dunken	have you tried to install with only the main disk connected?
2008-05-26T20:17:00.000Z	dunken	erUSUL	yes ive tried that , and then it works
2008-05-26T20:18:00.000Z	dunken	erUSUL	but when i then start adding more hds , it stops
2008-05-26T20:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	dunken	so there is no problem now
2008-05-26T20:19:00.000Z	dunken	erUSUL	yes still same problem :(
2008-05-26T20:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	dunken	!@#!@# it shouldn't fail... are you sure boot sequence on bios is th right one *after* you plug the other disks ??
2008-05-26T20:31:00.000Z	dunken	erUSUL	http://osdir.com/ml/boot-loaders.grub.devel/2006-08/msg00055.html did find some info ..but no solution
