2006-11-19T13:30:00.000Z	JeffBell	ashika	how do I install windows media player?
2006-11-19T13:31:00.000Z	ashika	JeffBell	Use WINE to emulate the windows environment and run installer via WINE.
2006-11-19T13:32:00.000Z	JeffBell	ashika	since you gave an interesting answer... is WINE considered, by consensus, to be better than a VMWare solution?  I've never run either under linux.
2006-11-19T13:33:00.000Z	ashika	JeffBell	VMware takes more system resources does it not?
2006-11-19T13:33:00.000Z	JeffBell	ashika	I've not encountered a situation where that affects me, yet.
2006-11-19T13:33:00.000Z	ashika	JeffBell	Then its personal preference.
2006-11-19T13:35:00.000Z	ashika	JeffBell	I hear for the most part it is good if set up correctly.
2006-11-19T13:38:00.000Z	ashika	JeffBell	According to linuxforums and WineDB it works.
2006-11-19T13:39:00.000Z	JeffBell	ashika	I was just reading that and will give it the old college try =] 
2006-11-19T13:40:00.000Z	ashika	JeffBell	If you want to be professional then you can buy CrossWeaver or *cough*torrent/warez*cough* and use it as it runs photoshop cs2 100%
2006-11-19T13:40:00.000Z	JeffBell	ashika	I'll check out this CrossWeaver business....
2006-11-19T13:40:00.000Z	ashika	JeffBell	So JeffBell are you really asking a question or just having fun? You seem like the kind of person who already knows the answer.
2006-11-19T13:42:00.000Z	JeffBell	ashika	I started off joke about windows media... but I'm now serious =] 
2006-11-19T13:42:00.000Z	ashika	JeffBell	I see. It seems lile youre just having fun to me ;)
2006-11-19T13:42:00.000Z	JeffBell	ashika	only at the beginning... once you mentioned WINE, you had me tame as a small rabbit
2006-11-19T13:44:00.000Z	ashika	JeffBell	I've always viewed GIMP as the
2006-11-19T13:44:00.000Z	ashika	JeffBell	'freebie' which is for people who dont want to buy Photoshop or get it illegaly.
2006-11-19T13:45:00.000Z	JeffBell	ashika	I think that's a good summary of GIMP.  it works well for basic photo edits or maybe some original web graphics.
2006-11-19T13:50:00.000Z	ashika	JeffBell	in my opinion you have your mind made and either stick to Krita or use Wine/Crossover.
2006-11-19T13:51:00.000Z	JeffBell	ashika	what I am happy to learn today.... having made up my mind, previously, to stick with Windows as my primary boot.... is that I *can* find a way to use Photoshop inside of Ubuntu.  That surprises and pleases me to no end!
2006-11-19T13:51:00.000Z	ashika	JeffBell	Use wine it has been reported by some that CS2 works.
