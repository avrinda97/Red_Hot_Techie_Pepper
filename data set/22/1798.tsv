2010-01-07T07:06:00.000Z	dragondon		greetings all
2010-01-07T07:07:00.000Z	dragondon		looking for a program that is opensource/free and uses ambient sounds (with a windows verstion needed....yeah...I know...)
2010-01-07T07:08:00.000Z	usser	dragondon	cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp :)
2010-01-07T07:08:00.000Z	usser	dragondon	but seriously elaborate
2010-01-07T07:10:00.000Z	dragondon	usser	need to find a program that uses abmient sounds (either user added or included) and my wacky idea of  creating it through Ubuntu and porting it to windows to show off :)  Although I don't know squat about programming...
2010-01-07T07:11:00.000Z	usser	dragondon	thats it?
2010-01-07T07:13:00.000Z	usser	dragondon	hang on a sec
2010-01-07T07:13:00.000Z	dragondon	usser	yeah, visuals are not critical.  Think nice meditating or falling asleep sound-type program.
2010-01-07T07:33:00.000Z	usser	dragondon	meh started writing a script for it but realized you can just use mplayer on command line with a playlist and shuffle
2010-01-07T07:33:00.000Z	usser	dragondon	anyhow, if its any use, heres a little script that will keep picking a song from a directory at random and play it until you kill it

2010-01-07T07:35:00.000Z	dragondon	usser	thanks, although only been using Ubuntu for about 4 months (somewhat new to me but not new to tech, cut my teeth on a Vic20 :) so we'll see if I can get it working :)
2010-01-07T07:36:00.000Z	usser	dragondon	just install mplayer-nogui with sudo apt-get install mplayer-nogui
2010-01-07T07:36:00.000Z	usser	dragondon	save the script somewhere ie in a file shuffle.sh
2010-01-07T07:36:00.000Z	usser	dragondon	make it executable chmod +x /path/to/shuffle.sh
2010-01-07T07:37:00.000Z	usser	dragondon	and run it with /path/to/shuffle.sh /directory/with/ambient/sounds
2010-01-07T07:40:00.000Z	dragondon	usser	 "The program 'shuffle' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
2010-01-07T07:40:00.000Z	usser	dragondon	cd /directory/where/you/saved/it
2010-01-07T07:40:00.000Z	usser	dragondon	bash ./shuffle.sh /directory/with/music
2010-01-07T07:43:00.000Z	dragondon	usser	thanks, will have to see about getting music on this systems.  I accidentally wiped out my whole backup (right after a reinstall)....so mildly stressed over loosing 50K number of files...
2010-01-07T07:45:00.000Z	usser	dragondon	heh welcome to the club
2010-01-07T07:46:00.000Z	dragondon	usser	thanks again.....learning is soooo much fun....
