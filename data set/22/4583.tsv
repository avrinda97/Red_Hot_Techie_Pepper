2009-04-25T20:49:00.000Z	h00k	jerbear	yep1
2009-04-25T20:50:00.000Z	jerbear	h00k	seriously? is it a native driver?
2009-04-25T20:50:00.000Z	h00k	jerbear	i'm on it now
2009-04-25T20:50:00.000Z	h00k	jerbear	on my EEE
2009-04-25T20:50:00.000Z	jerbear	h00k	dad: i'm thinking about getting a 1000he, but i'm just concerned about how easy it is to setup the hardware (touchpad, buttons, etc). any advice?
2009-04-25T20:51:00.000Z	h00k	jerbear	everything works out of the box.
2009-04-25T20:51:00.000Z	jerbear	h00k	and you have a 1000he?
2009-04-25T20:51:00.000Z	h00k	jerbear	the camera and bluetooth is turned off in the BIOS, but everything else works.
2009-04-25T20:51:00.000Z	h00k	jerbear	yes
2009-04-25T20:51:00.000Z	jerbear	h00k	do those components work when turned on?
2009-04-25T20:52:00.000Z	jerbear	h00k	dad just said he was having problems with the buttons. any input on that?
2009-04-25T20:52:00.000Z	h00k	jerbear	which buttons?
2009-04-25T20:53:00.000Z	jerbear	h00k	does the volume control use the OSD?
2009-04-25T20:54:00.000Z	h00k	jerbear	the FN+F11/F12 (volume up, volume down, respectively) controls the volume levels by default
2009-04-25T20:54:00.000Z	jerbear	h00k	and that all works as expected, and uses the OSD?
2009-04-25T20:54:00.000Z	h00k	jerbear	yep
2009-04-25T20:55:00.000Z	jerbear	h00k	anything else to be aware of? i'm really trying to find an easy piece of hardware to install to
2009-04-25T20:55:00.000Z	h00k	jerbear	I have not run into any quirks, everything is excellent.  i'm on mine now.  Also, the advanced desktop effects even look surprisingly good.
2009-04-25T20:56:00.000Z	h00k	jerbear	see my private message
2009-04-25T21:00:00.000Z	h00k	jerbear	also note https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport/Machines/Netbooks states there is a recording problem but I haven't been effected by it at all, hopefully your dad wont eitther
