2007-06-02T11:18:00.000Z	skulrid		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/23749/ why do I get this error
2007-06-02T11:19:00.000Z	LjL	skulrid	you probably don't have Universe and Multiverse enabled.
2007-06-02T11:38:00.000Z	LjL	skulrid	why on earth are you trying to install ktorrent from source?
2007-06-02T11:39:00.000Z	skulrid	LjL	k torrent crashed once, now it wont start (i see it on system monitor but the program doesent load at all, same goes to azureus), I tryed to UNinsstall/reeinstall with synaptic and nothing works, now I was trying that...
2007-06-02T11:40:00.000Z	LjL	skulrid	what a terrible idea. the fact that you see it on the system monitor means that it *is* running, but just frozen. kill it.
2007-06-02T11:40:00.000Z	LjL	skulrid	 killall ktorrent  in a terminal. and don't go out of your way installing source tarballs just because a program locks up.
2007-06-02T11:41:00.000Z	skulrid	LjL	already killed it LOTS of times in fact, it doesent work...
2007-06-02T11:41:00.000Z	LjL	skulrid	if you're seeing it on the system monitor, it's *not* been killed.
2007-06-02T11:42:00.000Z	LjL	skulrid	then why would you be seeing it on the system monitor? you mean *after* starting it then?
2007-06-02T11:43:00.000Z	LjL	skulrid	ok then kill it again and remove the ~/.kde/share/apps/ktorrent directory (careful, this will remove your downloads as well)
2007-06-02T11:44:00.000Z	LjL	skulrid	you won't lose them if they aren't in that folder i mentioned.
2007-06-02T11:45:00.000Z	LjL	skulrid	remove that folder. or rename it. type  mv ~/.kde/share/apps/ktorrent ~/ktorrent-backup 
2007-06-02T11:45:00.000Z	skulrid	LjL	whats the best way to remove the ~/.kde/share/apps/ktorrent directory ?
2007-06-02T11:45:00.000Z	LjL	skulrid	i just gave you a command i think
2007-06-02T11:53:00.000Z	skulrid	LjL	it worked, ktorrent now running. thank you
