2012-11-01T23:58:00.000Z	OpenSorce	gogeta1	LFS? Linux From Scratch? May be before your time :-)
2012-11-01T23:58:00.000Z	gogeta1	OpenSorce	so its not ok
2012-11-01T23:58:00.000Z	gogeta1		no
2012-11-01T23:58:00.000Z	gogeta1	OpenSorce	came in halfway in the convo
2012-11-01T23:59:00.000Z	gogeta1	OpenSorce	so your trying to do a lfs ubuntu?
2012-11-01T23:59:00.000Z	OpenSorce	gogeta1	No worries, I was trying to downgrade from 10.04 on this tablet with Transmeta Crusoe TC5800 proc, 256mb ram
2012-11-01T23:59:00.000Z	OpenSorce	gogeta1	I've been assured that the earlier distros will not run any faster so I'll leave it alone
2012-11-02T00:00:00.000Z	gogeta1	OpenSorce	may i suggest bodhi linux for that
2012-11-02T00:00:00.000Z	gogeta1	OpenSorce	well unity is a resoruse hog
2012-11-02T00:00:00.000Z	OpenSorce		Still runs 5 times faster than Windows did. Yeah I've been looking at bohi
2012-11-02T00:00:00.000Z	OpenSorce		*bodhi
2012-11-02T00:00:00.000Z	OpenSorce	gogeta1	Using Lubuntu 10.04 on it atm
2012-11-02T00:00:00.000Z	gogeta1	OpenSorce	it uses e17 fast and nice
2012-11-02T00:01:00.000Z	gogeta1	OpenSorce	they use here own softwhere composting rather then use slow cpu falllbacks 12.10 uses
2012-11-02T00:02:00.000Z	OpenSorce		Just such a pain to put anything on this tablet. No removable media drives, will not boot from USB... Netboot worked after several attempts though :-)
2012-11-02T00:02:00.000Z	gogeta1	OpenSorce	wile still being nearly as light as lxde
2012-11-02T00:02:00.000Z	gogeta1	OpenSorce	outch
2012-11-02T00:02:00.000Z	OpenSorce		I'm gonna see if they have a Netboot iso for Bodhi
2012-11-02T00:03:00.000Z	OpenSorce		Ouch, bodhi doesn't even have a channel here that I can see...
2012-11-02T00:03:00.000Z	gogeta1	OpenSorce	its based on ubuntu
2012-11-02T00:04:00.000Z	OpenSorce		Well that's encouraging...
2012-11-02T00:04:00.000Z	gogeta1	OpenSorce	its like a base install with a wm and a few basics
