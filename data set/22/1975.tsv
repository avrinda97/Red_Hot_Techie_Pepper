2009-11-04T02:47:00.000Z	cheater99		is there some way to emulate the mouse using, say, the numpad?
2009-11-04T02:47:00.000Z	lmentop	cheater99	use terminal
2009-11-04T02:54:00.000Z	lmentop	cheater99	is xserver-xorg-input-synaptics installed, are you loading the current kernel and not the one from 9.04?
2009-11-04T02:56:00.000Z	cheater99	lmentop	the kernel that is displayed in grub is from 9.04, there is none from 9.10. that package is installed and the latest version.
2009-11-04T02:57:00.000Z	lmentop	cheater99	check http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1280739 it seems that running an/the old kernel can cause the trackpad to not work...
2009-11-04T02:58:00.000Z	cheater99	lmentop	i have not installed a 'new' kernel so how is 9.04 an 'old' kernel?
2009-11-04T02:58:00.000Z	cheater99	lmentop	that makes no sense.
2009-11-04T02:58:00.000Z	lmentop	cheater99	aren't you using 9.10?
2009-11-04T03:00:00.000Z	cheater99	lmentop	at some point when 9.10 came out i got a lot of package updates in the update manager, so i updated everything, and when i rebooted the trackpad wasn't working anymore!
2009-11-04T03:00:00.000Z	lmentop	cheater99	ahh, i though you meant you updated from .04 to .10, do you have a backup of your xorg settings or can you copy someone elses?
2009-11-04T03:00:00.000Z	cheater99	lmentop	no backup. i tried copying someone else's and it still doesn't work.
2009-11-04T03:01:00.000Z	lmentop	cheater99	sorry dude, i'm stumped.
2009-11-04T03:03:00.000Z	cheater99	lmentop	maybe i need to somehow make a complete upgrade to 9.10 ?
2009-11-04T03:03:00.000Z	cheater99	lmentop	do you think that could help?
2009-11-04T03:03:00.000Z	cheater99	lmentop	and how would i do that from the terminal?
2009-11-04T03:03:00.000Z	lmentop	cheater99	sudo apt-get update  then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-11-04T03:04:00.000Z	cheater99	lmentop	^
2009-11-04T03:05:00.000Z	lmentop	cheater99	sudo do-release-upgrade ?
2009-11-04T03:06:00.000Z	cheater99	lmentop	for the time being... do you know of an emulator that lets me have a pretend-mouse with my numpad?
2009-11-04T03:06:00.000Z	cheater99	lmentop	ubuntu is completely inoperable for me without a mouse
2009-11-04T03:06:00.000Z	lmentop	cheater99	no sorry
