2006-04-13T14:21:00.000Z	roryy	ubuntu_user_1	what library is it looking for ?
2006-04-13T14:24:00.000Z	roryy	ubuntu_user_1	try installing libssl-dev
2006-04-13T14:24:00.000Z	ubuntu_user_1	roryy	was that directed to me? I need development packages?
2006-04-13T14:24:00.000Z	ubuntu_user_1	roryy	ok I'll look in synaptic.
2006-04-13T14:25:00.000Z	ubuntu_user_1	roryy	I found libssl0.9.6 - I am guessing that I could just hit google and download it that way as well?
2006-04-13T14:25:00.000Z	roryy	ubuntu_user_1	i recommend using ubuntu packages
2006-04-13T14:25:00.000Z	roryy	ubuntu_user_1	what are you trying to compile?
2006-04-13T14:27:00.000Z	ubuntu_user_1	roryy	I am trying to compile rdesktop-1.4.1 so that I can connect to a windows machine using RDP.
2006-04-13T14:27:00.000Z	roryy	ubuntu_user_1	rdesktop 1.4.1 is in the ubuntu repositories
2006-04-13T14:27:00.000Z	ubuntu_user_1	roryy	I am going to install the 0.9.8 version and see if it works. If not I found this website in google -
2006-04-13T14:28:00.000Z	ubuntu_user_1	roryy	will rdesktop connect using RDP? I thought I would have to load vnc on the windows machine?
2006-04-13T14:29:00.000Z	roryy	ubuntu_user_1	according to rdesktop's description, it is an 'RDP client'. I do not know what that means.  However, I highly recommend trying the ubuntu-provided package before attempting to compile your own
2006-04-13T14:29:00.000Z	ubuntu_user_1	roryy	--sorry it's late I didn't fully read your last post - I understand now - I should install rdesktop from synaptic.
2006-04-13T14:30:00.000Z	ubuntu_user_1	roryy	instead of trying to compile it.
2006-04-13T14:32:00.000Z	roryy	ubuntu_user_1	have you tried that app?
2006-04-13T14:33:00.000Z	ubuntu_user_1	roryy	no I am still trying to find it in synaptic. Synaptic is the same as ubuntu repositories, correct?
2006-04-13T14:41:00.000Z	roryy	ubuntu_user_1	good stuff
2006-04-13T14:33:00.000Z	roryy	ubuntu_user_1	first try 'Applications -> Internet -> Terminal services client'
2006-04-13T14:34:00.000Z	roryy	ubuntu_user_1	Synaptic does use the ubuntu internet repositories -- you may need to set it up to do so, though.
2006-04-13T14:35:00.000Z	ubuntu_user_1	roryy	by editing sources.lists?
2006-04-13T14:35:00.000Z	roryy	ubuntu_user_1	yeah, or properties -> repositories in synaptic (i think)
2006-04-13T14:41:00.000Z	ubuntu_user_1	roryy	HA! Terminal Service Client worked!
