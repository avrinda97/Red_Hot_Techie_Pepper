2010-03-28T00:19:00.000Z	Azelphur	kevalmighty	Nobody here can help you any more than what it says "Backup all data and replace the disk"
2010-03-28T00:19:00.000Z	Azelphur	kevalmighty	that means "It's breaking down"
2010-03-28T00:20:00.000Z	kevalmighty	Azelphur	yah but I dont get it ... it was fine before I installed ubuntu on it
2010-03-28T00:20:00.000Z	kevalmighty	Azelphur	done the same thing on my server computer..
2010-03-28T00:20:00.000Z	Azelphur	kevalmighty	what did you have on it before?
2010-03-28T00:20:00.000Z	kevalmighty	Azelphur	windows 7 , well i still have it , im dual booting..
2010-03-28T00:21:00.000Z	Azelphur	kevalmighty	windows 7 doesn't notify you of smart issues
2010-03-28T00:21:00.000Z	Azelphur	kevalmighty	feel lucky you installed ubuntu so it could tell you about the problem before you suffered data loss
2010-03-28T00:21:00.000Z	kevalmighty	Azelphur	ok so what I copy data and format?
2010-03-28T00:21:00.000Z	Azelphur	kevalmighty	copy data, use manufacturers tool to verify that what ubuntu says is correct, then throw the drive in the bin and buy a new one.
2010-03-28T00:22:00.000Z	kevalmighty	Azelphur	 huh ur kidding its a new one..
2010-03-28T00:22:00.000Z	Azelphur	kevalmighty	use manufacturers tool to verify that it's broken then return it
2010-03-28T00:22:00.000Z	kevalmighty	Azelphur	where can I find that tool?
2010-03-28T00:23:00.000Z	Azelphur	kevalmighty	http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/support/downloads/seatools
2010-03-28T00:23:00.000Z	Azelphur	kevalmighty	only applies to seagate drives, but you have a seagate (I checked your model number)
