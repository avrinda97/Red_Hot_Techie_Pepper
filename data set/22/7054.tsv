2006-11-12T11:07:00.000Z	bruenig	graeme	copy and paste the following, sudo sed '/s/# deb/deb/g' -i.old /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install mozilla-dev mozilla-psm
2006-11-12T11:10:00.000Z	bruenig	graeme	just copy and paste that entire thing,
2006-11-12T11:17:00.000Z	graeme	bruenig	that's not valid regex ...
2006-11-12T11:17:00.000Z	bruenig	graeme	?
2006-11-12T11:18:00.000Z	graeme	bruenig	sed: -e expression #1, char 4: comments don't accept any addresses
2006-11-12T11:19:00.000Z	bruenig	graeme	did you try my command and this is an error you say?
2006-11-12T11:20:00.000Z	bruenig	graeme	if you could pastebin  your sources.list that would probably be best. Did you copy and paste that entire command like I said or try some other way?
2006-11-12T11:21:00.000Z	graeme	bruenig	just copy and pasted it ...
2006-11-12T11:21:00.000Z	bruenig	graeme	the whole thing including the &&'s
2006-11-12T11:22:00.000Z	graeme	bruenig	http://pastebin.ca/246433
2006-11-12T11:23:00.000Z	bruenig	graeme	are you on breezy or dapper?
2006-11-12T11:23:00.000Z	graeme	bruenig	dapper
2006-11-12T11:24:00.000Z	graeme	bruenig	darn, the update never updated the sources.list ....
2006-11-12T11:24:00.000Z	bruenig	graeme	run the following command then, sudo sed 's/breezy/dapper/g' -i.backup /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install mozilla-dev mozilla-psm
2006-11-12T11:26:00.000Z	graeme	bruenig	Ok, I swapped breezy with dapper myself in the sources.list ...
2006-11-12T11:26:00.000Z	bruenig	graeme	yeah the command will still be fine even if you already replaced
2006-11-12T11:36:00.000Z	bruenig	graeme	democracy is terrible, I will agree with you there
2006-11-12T11:37:00.000Z	graeme	bruenig	it's a waste of time,
2006-11-12T11:37:00.000Z	bruenig	graeme	what do you mean internet tv. If you want to view flash videos or other imbedded stuff, you can do that in firefox. If you want to torrent stuff, you can do that and view it with totem or another media player. There is no need for that super app
2006-11-12T11:38:00.000Z	graeme	bruenig	well I have a need for a proper TV channel surfer, kinda like that one ... <babo can't remember the name of the windows one>
2006-11-12T11:39:00.000Z	bruenig	graeme	maybe it is one of those things you need once you have used it. I have never used any of those for any amount of time.
2006-11-12T11:39:00.000Z	graeme	bruenig	well, I'd like to watch HBO and international sports ..
