2011-06-06T00:03:00.000Z	w1n5ton		I have a really annoying problem
2011-06-06T00:03:00.000Z	w1n5ton		AT LEAST once a day my computers IP changes
2011-06-06T00:03:00.000Z	w1n5ton		I have to keep logging into the router and triggering ports for that computer
2011-06-06T00:03:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	local network IP or the internet IP?
2011-06-06T00:03:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	this is also a network issue and not a ubuntu issue.
2011-06-06T00:04:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	near the top right of the screen, you should see two arrows (one up and one down)
2011-06-06T00:05:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	right click it, and click "Edit Connections"
2011-06-06T00:07:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	well then you should see a radio signal icon (half ovals increasing upward)
2011-06-06T00:07:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	click the wireless tab
2011-06-06T00:07:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	select your wireless connect, (auto <connection name>)
2011-06-06T00:07:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	then click edit, then go to the IPv4 settings
2011-06-06T00:08:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	if you already know your ip information change the dhcp to manual,  if not right click the same icon as before and click "Connection Information"
2011-06-06T00:09:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	once you know your network information, change the Method to manual then click add and type in the same information
2011-06-06T00:09:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	after you click save you will have that ip the entire time
2011-06-06T00:11:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	what is your current ip?
2011-06-06T00:12:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	try 192.168.1.1 if you don't have internet after using that, open it back up and try 192.168.1.254
2011-06-06T00:12:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	the subnet mask is the netmask
2011-06-06T00:12:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	yes
2011-06-06T00:13:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	then the gateway would be 192.168.1.254
2011-06-06T00:13:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	ok, then you should have the same ip for the entire time that computer connects to your wireless connection.
2011-06-06T00:14:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	it'll use that IP when it reconnects
2011-06-06T00:15:00.000Z	arleslie	w1n5ton	your welcome
