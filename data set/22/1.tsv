2004-09-27T07:54:00.000Z	fabbione	cc	plus a lot of black magic :-)
2004-09-27T07:54:00.000Z	cc	fabbione	and it detects things sanely? our ddcprobe doesn't do OFvb stuff correctly
2004-09-27T07:54:00.000Z	fabbione	cc	"our" ?
2004-09-27T07:54:00.000Z	cc	fabbione	and lshw for instance, or lspci detects hardware with totally wrong vram. trying to poke #address-cells to see if thats right or not, but seemingly no
2004-09-27T07:55:00.000Z	cc	fabbione	fedora ppc (sorry)
2004-09-27T07:55:00.000Z	fabbione	cc	Ovfb is disable by default
2004-09-27T07:55:00.000Z	fabbione	cc	we disable OFvb and VESA
2004-09-27T07:56:00.000Z	fabbione	cc	but we probe the others.. it's not always sane.. it does its best...
2004-09-27T07:56:00.000Z	fabbione	cc	but usually in the worst case it will ask the user what to do
2004-09-27T07:56:00.000Z	cc	fabbione	ah. ok. so ddcprobe and X -probeonly actually tend to make sane decisions. ddcprobe mostly gives me crack answers on the ppc hardware i have here though
2004-09-27T07:56:00.000Z	cc	fabbione	will ping you when i get to reading the sources for the debian/ubuntu stuff. thanks!
2004-09-27T07:57:00.000Z	fabbione	cc	well it's a lot of shell scripting
2004-09-27T07:57:00.000Z	fabbione	cc	it has been working fine in all our tests.. too bad that the xresprobe is broken in the preview cd
2004-09-27T07:57:00.000Z	fabbione	cc	but you can get it from the archive directly
2004-09-27T07:58:00.000Z	cc	fabbione	hacks then. heh. but i believe jdub when he says its all very sweet.
2004-09-27T07:58:00.000Z	fabbione	cc	hehhe well we did our best
2004-09-27T07:58:00.000Z	fabbione	cc	with the hardware we had.. clearly unknown hardware might give different results
2004-09-27T07:59:00.000Z	fabbione	cc	liveCd doesn't use the same probe technique
2004-09-27T07:59:00.000Z	cc	fabbione	you guys definitely have more hardware than we have... we work against the crowd to get ppc working
2004-09-27T07:59:00.000Z	cc	fabbione	ah, okay. so i'm gonna install it soon then
2004-09-27T08:00:00.000Z	cc	fabbione	yeah, our ddcprobe is on crack. atirage128 with 512mb of ram on an iMac (for example). my laptops give weird ones too.
2004-09-27T08:01:00.000Z	fabbione	cc	eheh well test it and let us know. any feedback is good
