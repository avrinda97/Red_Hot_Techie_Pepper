2009-02-20T18:28:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem		I have 2 partitions, one as / and the other as /home but I would like to move my /home to my / ...is it possible?
2009-02-20T18:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Carpe|Diem	 yes. you could do that.
2009-02-20T18:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Carpe|Diem	 properly move the files from /home to /To_Be_Home,  unmount  /home/ then rename /ToBeHome to /home
2009-02-20T18:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Carpe|Diem	 only fstab editing would be to edit out the  line that mounts home. thats trivial
2009-02-20T18:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Carpe|Diem	 the trick is copying the home the proper way.. depending on what files are in there, and other special files like links and stuff.. it may get confused
2009-02-20T18:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Carpe|Diem	 do what you want.. but what you are asking about is a rather trivial thing.. and you will never learn untill you try
2009-02-20T18:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Carpe|Diem	and as far as 'deep' this is rather shallow stuff.
2009-02-20T18:33:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	Dr_willis	I can copy my home while the system is running?
2009-02-20T18:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Carpe|Diem	 yes.
2009-02-20T18:35:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	Dr_willis	Problem is, my /home partition is mounted into /home on my root partition...So where do I have to move my /home folder too?:s
2009-02-20T18:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Carpe|Diem	 you said /   - so you sauid you  wanted it in /home so like i mentioned.. use /to_be_home to move stuff to.. Unmount /home/ delete /home  THEN rename the  /to_be_home to become /home
2009-02-20T18:45:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	Dr_willis	dont leave me swimming in the deep alone XD
2009-02-20T18:50:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	Dr_willis	It's copied...Now what, unmount my home? But the files are being used atm. And also, do I have to change ownership of the /to_be_home directory?
2009-02-20T18:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Carpe|Diem	 well i suggest you stop using them..
2009-02-20T18:51:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	Dr_willis	ok, I have to terminate X?
2009-02-20T18:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Carpe|Diem	 If you copied the stuff correctly the permissions would of staied the same.. you proberkly did it wrong,. :)  I dont recall  the right command/optionms to copy them
2009-02-20T18:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Carpe|Diem	 may be a goiod idea :)
2009-02-20T18:51:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	Dr_willis	I uwed cp -rv /home/Â¨
2009-02-20T18:51:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	Dr_willis	i mean, cp -rv /home/* /to_be_home
2009-02-20T18:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Carpe|Diem	 check the stuff copied.. see if it still has the original correct ownership
2009-02-20T18:53:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	Dr_willis	root is the owner of the new copied folder...so its incorrect:/ I copied it while being root
2009-02-20T18:54:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	Dr_willis	perhaps its better for me to leave everything as is :s
