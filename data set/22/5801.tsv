2007-06-03T16:33:00.000Z	techie1		can anybody tell me if I can just download the new Ubuntu 7. something since I have now 6.10 without any major issues?
2007-06-03T16:34:00.000Z	mwe	techie1	you can upgrade but that's not what you want?
2007-06-03T16:34:00.000Z	techie1		Also how do change "fonts" in xchat?
2007-06-03T16:34:00.000Z	mwe	techie1	settings
2007-06-03T16:34:00.000Z	techie1		<mwe>tell me what I want then? Explain further!
2007-06-03T16:35:00.000Z	mwe	techie1	I was asking you ;)
2007-06-03T16:36:00.000Z	techie1		ok I got my new settings for the xchat fonts.... how about upgrading to 7.02 when 6.10
2007-06-03T16:36:00.000Z	mwe		!upgrade | techie1
2007-06-03T16:36:00.000Z	techie1		mwe.... I hear you. I am very pleased with the 6.10 so far
2007-06-03T16:36:00.000Z	mwe	techie1	yes
2007-06-03T16:36:00.000Z	techie1	mwe	i thought that upgrading to 7.02 would add other needed features.... but I am not sure.
2007-06-03T16:37:00.000Z	mwe	techie1	It shouldn't
2007-06-03T16:37:00.000Z	mwe	techie1	It should just update your program versions
2007-06-03T16:37:00.000Z	techie1		mwe.... ok....
2007-06-03T16:37:00.000Z	mwe	techie1	and kernel etc.
2007-06-03T16:38:00.000Z	techie1	mwe	I had a whole "fiasco" with home computer with double boot and had to re-install windows xp and lost ubuntu. Just today I have been able to get it all back and of course I had not been able to use Ubuntu. It is interesting how windows gobbled up ubuntu double boot and I had to re-install ubuntu.
2007-06-03T16:39:00.000Z	mwe	techie1	you should have just reinstalled grub ;)
2007-06-03T16:39:00.000Z	techie1	mwe	of course I had to re-install xchat to be here.
2007-06-03T16:39:00.000Z	techie1	mwe	I was using gparted
2007-06-03T16:39:00.000Z	mwe	techie1	if windows renders linux unbootable just reinstall grub. not the entire OS ;)
2007-06-03T16:39:00.000Z	mwe	techie1	well if you removed the linux partition then ...
2007-06-03T16:40:00.000Z	techie1	mwe	and ompaul I was using Gparted
