2007-12-07T09:09:00.000Z	robrrr	nickrud	thanks, will that stop the account from being used or just mean that i must su to root?
2007-12-07T09:09:00.000Z	nickrud	robrrr	sudo will work, su shouldn't
2007-12-07T11:02:00.000Z	nickrud	robrrr	you can get a copy of the deb on packages.ubuntu.com, and open it with archive manager
2007-12-07T11:02:00.000Z	robrrr	nickrud	thanks
2007-12-07T11:07:00.000Z	robrrr	nickrud	im new to linux how would i download the package so it won't install, i've only ever used apt-get
2007-12-07T11:08:00.000Z	nickrud	robrrr	use these instructions: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu#head-381bea41610683e5e26322fd7028e7aef85e3105

2007-12-07T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	robrrr	you can do sudo apt-get install --download-only ssh-server ; the file will be in /var/cache/apt/archives

2007-12-07T11:19:00.000Z	robrrr	nickrud	i've got the .deb file how to i view the contents?
2007-12-07T11:20:00.000Z	nickrud	robrrr	file-roller /var/cache/apt/archives/ssh-server<tab> (hit the tab key to complete the file name), or navigate with the filemanager and right click, open with archive manager
2007-12-07T11:21:00.000Z	robrrr	nickrud	im using the terminal, no gui, im on ubuntu server, still possible?
2007-12-07T11:22:00.000Z	nickrud	robrrr	ah, you need to install mc , it's a text file browser. It'll open a deb package
2007-12-07T11:22:00.000Z	robrrr	nickrud	thanks! :)
2007-12-07T11:22:00.000Z	nickrud	robrrr	mc is just fantastic in a terminal
2007-12-07T11:24:00.000Z	robrrr	nickrud	thanks im really not enjoying vi, infact vi is driving me a bit crazy
2007-12-07T11:25:00.000Z	nickrud	robrrr	it's time to move up to emacs then, or down to nano for quicky stuff
