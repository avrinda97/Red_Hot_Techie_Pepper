2012-07-25T21:05:00.000Z	Jonii		Is it just me or has Ubuntu 12.04 been getting more and more bugs as it has aged?
2012-07-25T21:06:00.000Z	islandmonkey	Jonii	It's you. I have a few annoying bugs, but some people may have none, some people may have more.
2012-07-25T21:06:00.000Z	Jonii		When I first installed it, it felt refreshingly stable. Now, alt+ctrl+shift+arrow moving windows doesn't work no more, clickpad ceases to work after few days of use, forcing relogin, X has started crashing, windows have been disappearing, icons not loading on launcher...
2012-07-25T21:07:00.000Z	Jonii		I didn't have such problems for the first few weeks after installing
2012-07-25T21:08:00.000Z	Jonii	ThinkT510	maybe 2 months
2012-07-25T21:09:00.000Z	Jonii	ThinkT510	oh, misunderstood
2012-07-25T21:09:00.000Z	Jonii		I haven't installed that many programs really. Gnome Do, Emacs, org-mode, spotify, netbeans, chromium
2012-07-25T21:10:00.000Z	Jonii		That's about it
2012-07-25T21:10:00.000Z	islandmonkey		!info | gnome-do
2012-07-25T21:10:00.000Z	Jonii	ThinkT510	I think it was
2012-07-25T21:10:00.000Z	islandmonkey		!package | gnome-do
2012-07-25T21:11:00.000Z	islandmonkey		Oh thanks
2012-07-25T21:11:00.000Z	Jonii	ThinkT510	yeah
2012-07-25T21:12:00.000Z	Jonii	ThinkT510	seems to work just fine
2012-07-25T21:13:00.000Z	Jonii		I was told that it is better than Unity lenses + HUD
2012-07-25T21:13:00.000Z	islandmonkey		HUD FTW
2012-07-25T21:14:00.000Z	Jonii	ThinkT510	I just recently installed it, I haven't had any new problems after installing it, just the same old
2012-07-25T21:15:00.000Z	Jonii		ppa?
2012-07-25T21:15:00.000Z	Jonii		I don't remember really :|
2012-07-25T21:15:00.000Z	Jonii		Spotify is PPA
2012-07-25T21:15:00.000Z	Jonii		But I don't remember if there are more PPA things I have attempted
2012-07-25T21:16:00.000Z	islandmonkey	Jonii	You can find all the PPA's you installed in Software SO
