2005-06-09T11:43:00.000Z	pestilence	marky	/etc/shorewall
2005-06-09T11:46:00.000Z	pestilence	marky	have you looked at the files in /etc/shorewall
2005-06-09T11:47:00.000Z	pestilence	marky	and how about the documentation on the shorewall website or in /usr/share/doc/shorewall?
2005-06-09T11:47:00.000Z	marky	pestilence	well.. i don't understand itu
2005-06-09T11:48:00.000Z	marky	pestilence	it is just too... complicated
2005-06-09T11:48:00.000Z	pestilence	marky	what are you trying to do
2005-06-09T11:48:00.000Z	marky	pestilence	i'm trying to build a gateway
2005-06-09T11:49:00.000Z	marky	pestilence	and i want to install firewall of course
2005-06-09T11:49:00.000Z	marky	pestilence	the gateway itself well.. is an old computer, so maybe i'll use command line instead of any GUI
2005-06-09T11:49:00.000Z	pestilence	marky	shorewall is a bit complicated for a beginner.  that's about all i can say :)
2005-06-09T11:50:00.000Z	marky	pestilence	mm... can you recommend any other firewall ?
2005-06-09T11:50:00.000Z	pestilence	marky	for just a firewall, you could look at rc.firewall.  very simple.
2005-06-09T11:51:00.000Z	marky	pestilence	rc.firewall ?
2005-06-09T11:51:00.000Z	pestilence	marky	http://projectfiles.com/firewall/
2005-06-09T11:51:00.000Z	marky	pestilence	i'll try
2005-06-09T11:52:00.000Z	marky	pestilence	is it textmode ?
2005-06-09T11:52:00.000Z	pestilence	marky	yes.
2005-06-09T11:53:00.000Z	pestilence	marky	but pretty much all you hav to do is run the script.
2005-06-09T12:10:00.000Z	marky	pestilence	i've download that rc.firewall
2005-06-09T12:10:00.000Z	marky	pestilence	is it just 71.3 KB ?
2005-06-09T12:50:00.000Z	marky	pestilence	the 60 Hz monitor hehehehehe
