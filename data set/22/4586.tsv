2007-12-04T09:04:00.000Z	LinuxRocks		can anyone help me get flash and shockwave plugins for mizilla firefox?
2007-12-04T09:04:00.000Z	kelsin	LinuxRocks	on my gutsy install I just went to a site with flash and a wizard walked me through install the adobe flash 9 player
2007-12-04T09:06:00.000Z	kelsin	LinuxRocks	does going to a flash enabled site not bring up the wizard in firefox for you?
2007-12-04T09:07:00.000Z	kelsin	LinuxRocks	try that command from a terminal
2007-12-04T09:08:00.000Z	kelsin	LinuxRocks	"sudo aptitude install flashplugin-nonfree"
2007-12-04T09:09:00.000Z	kelsin	LinuxRocks	are you on a ubuntu systeM?
2007-12-04T09:10:00.000Z	kelsin	LinuxRocks	and yet you don't have aptitude? try "sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree" then
2007-12-04T09:25:00.000Z	LinuxRocks	kelsin	im on a amd64 ubuntu system can installing flash plugins be hard on that?
2007-12-04T09:25:00.000Z	kelsin	LinuxRocks	very
2007-12-04T09:25:00.000Z	kelsin	LinuxRocks	adobe only makes a 32 bit flash player, I would google alot, it is a common issue
2007-12-04T09:26:00.000Z	LinuxRocks	kelsin	if i get x86 will it matter? will it solve my issues?
2007-12-04T09:28:00.000Z	LinuxRocks	kelsin	do you think i should get x86 ubuntu version?
2007-12-04T09:29:00.000Z	kelsin	LinuxRocks	I recommend that yes. The effect of actually running 64bit on the desktop is not worth it imho
2007-12-04T09:30:00.000Z	LinuxRocks	kelsin	im running x64 on a laptop will x86 work better than what i got?
2007-12-04T09:31:00.000Z	kelsin	LinuxRocks	it will avoid the issues you will have like with flash, there are many pages on the net talking about the differences and pros and cons
2007-12-04T09:32:00.000Z	LinuxRocks	kelsin	hmmm i got a AMD Turion 64 Mobile Technology with x64bit ubuntu running so u think x86 will make it go slow?
2007-12-04T09:33:00.000Z	kelsin	LinuxRocks	I already said that I think the small difference in performance is not worth the hassle on a desktop, that is also my opinion and to be taken with a grain of salt
2007-12-04T09:33:00.000Z	kelsin	LinuxRocks	most programs you will be running do not fully take advantage of 64bit anyway
2007-12-04T09:33:00.000Z	LinuxRocks	kelsin	so you saying try x86 right? sorry im new to this
2007-12-04T09:34:00.000Z	kelsin	LinuxRocks	for the third time, MY OPINION is that I would run x86 even on a 64 bit chip, if you want more info try google
2007-12-04T09:34:00.000Z	LinuxRocks	kelsin	thanks for the help
2007-12-04T09:34:00.000Z	kelsin	LinuxRocks	np
