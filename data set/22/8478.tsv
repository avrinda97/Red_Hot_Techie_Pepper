2005-08-03T08:19:00.000Z	arbir		ok abarbaccia here is my question.....
2005-08-03T08:21:00.000Z	arbir		in fedora i would do chkconfig
2005-08-03T08:22:00.000Z	arbir		frank... is there not chkconfig style doing it ?
2005-08-03T08:23:00.000Z	arbir		cani do ... chkconfig 2 ppp off
2005-08-03T08:24:00.000Z	arbir		right
2005-08-03T08:25:00.000Z	rob_p	arbir	 The Ubuntu equivalent to chkconfig is update-rc.d.  Read up on it.  It's not too difficult.
2005-08-03T08:25:00.000Z	arbir	rob_p	i have been working on that... i keep getting an error
2005-08-03T08:26:00.000Z	rob_p	arbir	 what sort of error?
2005-08-03T08:26:00.000Z	arbir	rob_p	 update-rc.d ppp start 14 2 .
2005-08-03T08:26:00.000Z	arbir		 System startup links for /etc/init.d/ppp already exist.
2005-08-03T08:27:00.000Z	rob_p	arbir	 so if it already exists, why are you trying to add it?
2005-08-03T08:27:00.000Z	arbir	rob_p	i want to disbaled that service
2005-08-03T08:27:00.000Z	arbir	rob_p	*disbale
2005-08-03T08:28:00.000Z	rob_p	arbir	 then do a, "update-rc.d -f ppp remove"
2005-08-03T08:28:00.000Z	arbir	rob_p	what does remove do ? will it delete the script from that directory?
2005-08-03T08:29:00.000Z	rob_p	arbir	 the same thing that "chkconfig --del ppp" would do on a Red Hat/Mandrake system... it removes it from the run levels...
2005-08-03T08:29:00.000Z	rob_p	arbir	 the script itself stays intact within the /etc/init.d/ directory but the symlinks are removed.  Understand?
2005-08-03T08:30:00.000Z	arbir	rob_p	i dont wan tto --del ppp
2005-08-03T08:30:00.000Z	arbir		i want to do this
2005-08-03T08:30:00.000Z	arbir		chkconfig 2 ppp off
2005-08-03T08:30:00.000Z	arbir		do you see what i am aiming at ?
2005-08-03T08:30:00.000Z	rob_p	arbir	 What do you want to do?
