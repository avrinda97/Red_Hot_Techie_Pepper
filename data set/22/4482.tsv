2008-09-07T17:08:00.000Z	Aquahallic		is there a way to use the terminal in ubuntu to talk to serial devices... like you'd do with putty??
2008-09-07T17:08:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	Aquahallic	quite a lot, really
2008-09-07T17:09:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	Aquahallic	you can simply wriote and read from the /dev/ files for example
2008-09-07T17:09:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	Aquahallic	with echo and cat
2008-09-07T17:09:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	Aquahallic	but that's quite cumbersome; gimme a sec, and I'll remind myself the name of the serial terminal app
2008-09-07T17:10:00.000Z	rysiek|pl		ah
2008-09-07T17:10:00.000Z	rysiek|pl		minicom
2008-09-07T17:10:00.000Z	Aquahallic	rysiek|pl	I have a 24 port switch down in my basement with a management port on it.. so I need to console into it
2008-09-07T17:10:00.000Z	rysiek|pl		that's it
2008-09-07T17:10:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	Aquahallic	ah, telnet then
2008-09-07T17:10:00.000Z	Aquahallic		is there something like procom? where you can write scripts for it?
2008-09-07T17:10:00.000Z	Aquahallic		can't... different subnet
2008-09-07T17:11:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	Aquahallic	so how exactly do you use putty on ut
2008-09-07T17:11:00.000Z	rysiek|pl		*it
2008-09-07T17:11:00.000Z	rysiek|pl		PiercedWolf: what exactly did you give me?
2008-09-07T17:11:00.000Z	Aquahallic		I open a serial session on com1 and plug right into the serial port on the back of the switch using putty usually
2008-09-07T17:11:00.000Z	rysiek|pl		d'oh
2008-09-07T17:12:00.000Z	Aquahallic		but I just installed dd-wrt on a router and set it up so I need to get into the swtich and setup vlan tagging then I can telnet to the managment console once I get my routing setup right...;)
2008-09-07T17:13:00.000Z	Aquahallic		yup yup.. .will do...;)
2008-09-07T17:13:00.000Z	Aquahallic		ty!
2008-09-07T17:13:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	Aquahallic	well then, plug into the switch's serial port and fire-up a serial session with minicom
