2007-03-12T15:40:00.000Z	StoneNote_	ubuntu	it's because you didn't pay attention to the minimal instructions during install. try installing again and actually read them.  it's only 6 pages.

2007-03-12T15:41:00.000Z	StoneNote_	ubuntu	how's the weather in San Jose, California?

2007-03-12T15:51:00.000Z	StoneNote_		[Tuxedo] , usually boards with onboard graphic adapters have an option in the bios to disable them. I'd check there
2007-03-12T15:52:00.000Z	StoneNote_		[Tuxedo] , you need a fglrx exerpt, which isn't me. sorry
