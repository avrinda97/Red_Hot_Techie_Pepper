2009-07-02T19:59:00.000Z	sheikh		i am already root so dont need to sudo it
2009-07-02T20:00:00.000Z	jrib	sheikh	Why do you want to do this?  What's your end-goal?
2009-07-02T19:58:00.000Z	jrib	sheikh	why shouldn't it work on ubuntu?
2009-07-02T20:02:00.000Z	jrib	sheikh	I don't understand what you mean by "username"'s LANG.  What if the user changes it after logging in?
2009-07-02T20:03:00.000Z	jrib	sheikh	what if it's different between terminals?
2009-07-02T20:04:00.000Z	jrib	sheikh	no, what if he sets a different lang in GDM for instance... That won't be reflected in what you get with your su command
2009-07-02T20:09:00.000Z	jrib	sheikh	then you already have your answer.  Use the su command
2009-07-02T20:09:00.000Z	jrib	sheikh	yes it is.
2009-07-02T20:10:00.000Z	jrib	sheikh	have you changed root's lang and verified?
2009-07-02T20:10:00.000Z	jrib	sheikh	you are running: su - USERNAME -c 'env | grep LANG'  ?
2009-07-02T20:16:00.000Z	jrib	sheikh	you haven't answered my qusetion
2009-07-02T20:20:00.000Z	sheikh	jrib	your command is returing null
2009-07-02T20:21:00.000Z	jrib	sheikh	well there you go
