2008-11-11T18:09:00.000Z	imachine		hi
2008-11-11T18:09:00.000Z	imachine		I've updated 8.04.1 with hardy-proposed, and my firefox translations are gone.
2008-11-11T18:09:00.000Z	imachine		are the -proposed update sources not recommended? or unstable?
2008-11-11T18:09:00.000Z	imachine		it was just a bunch of translations, but it seems they're not compatible with firefox 3.0.3
2008-11-11T18:10:00.000Z	dirtyhawk	imachine	-proposed is considered not yet fully stable and thus unsupported
2008-11-11T18:10:00.000Z	imachine	dirtyhawk	so, I should remove it from updateing?
2008-11-11T18:10:00.000Z	imachine	dirtyhawk	how can I come back to the previous set up then?
2008-11-11T18:10:00.000Z	imachine	dirtyhawk	disable proposed from /etc/apt/apt.sources and then what ?
2008-11-11T18:11:00.000Z	dirtyhawk	imachine	sorry, i never needed/tried to revert to older versions of packages.
2008-11-11T18:13:00.000Z	imachine	dirtyhawk	how can I check with apt preferably what package owns a particular file ?
2008-11-11T18:14:00.000Z	dirtyhawk	imachine	i don't know with apt, but in synaptics you can see it for every package
2008-11-11T18:14:00.000Z	imachine	dirtyhawk	ok cool. i'll try synaptic.
2008-11-11T18:16:00.000Z	dirtyhawk	imachine	find the package in synaptics => look for the packages' properties
2008-11-11T18:16:00.000Z	imachine	dirtyhawk	yeah got it thanks.
2008-11-11T18:18:00.000Z	imachine	dirtyhawk	ok cool , firefox is back to my original language.
2008-11-11T18:18:00.000Z	imachine	dirtyhawk	but before I updated from proposed, I checked the descriptions of the updates, and there hadn't seemed to be anything possibly dangerous.
2008-11-11T18:18:00.000Z	imachine	dirtyhawk	it's strange that it would be causing issues :-)
2008-11-11T18:18:00.000Z	dirtyhawk	imachine	i had this problem too, but then upgraded to intrepid. i think its something with the xulrunner-package
2008-11-11T18:19:00.000Z	imachine	dirtyhawk	yeah, xulrunner is ok, just the support files are incompatible with ffox.
2008-11-11T18:20:00.000Z	dirtyhawk	imachine	exactly the same in hardy-proposed for me; german?
2008-11-11T18:20:00.000Z	imachine	dirtyhawk	polish :)
2008-11-11T18:20:00.000Z	imachine	dirtyhawk	I think it affects all language support files tho ;]
