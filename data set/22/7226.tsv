2006-05-17T07:52:00.000Z	Kane666		hey
2006-05-17T07:52:00.000Z	Kane666		i was just wondering how do i compile c++ source code in linux?
2006-05-17T07:54:00.000Z	Kane666		does annyone know how to compile a c++ program (that i made) in ubuntu?
2006-05-17T07:54:00.000Z	hastesaver	Kane666	install gcc
2006-05-17T07:54:00.000Z	Kane666	hastesaver	yeh ive done that
2006-05-17T07:55:00.000Z	hastesaver	Kane666	then type "g++ <programname.cpp>" at the terminal; it will create a.out, and you can run it with "./a.out"
2006-05-17T07:55:00.000Z	Kane666	hastesaver	thanks ill try that now
2006-05-18T13:41:00.000Z	hastesaver	Kane666	type "killall esd" before starting audacity.
2006-05-18T13:47:00.000Z	Kane666	hastesaver	it worked! thanks. But could you please explain to me why i have to do this? (for future reference)
2006-05-18T13:48:00.000Z	hastesaver	Kane666	because esd (the so-called Enlightened Sound Daemon) has captured your audio, and audacity cannot use it until it is freed up
2006-05-18T13:48:00.000Z	Kane666	hastesaver	thanks for the info ;) but audacity isn't recording anything :S there is no 'spikes'
2006-05-18T13:49:00.000Z	hastesaver	Kane666	you can also find the settings for esd and ask it to release the device sooner (it's probably set to some ridiculously high amount like 60 seconds)
2006-05-18T13:50:00.000Z	hastesaver	Kane666	oh, not recording anything? Are you sure the input volume is not set to 0? :)
2006-05-18T13:51:00.000Z	Kane666	hastesaver	ive increased the mic volume in volume control.. i dont know if thats all i have to change or not ?
2006-05-18T13:51:00.000Z	hastesaver	Kane666	I once spent a day trying to figure out why my audacity wasn't working, and it turned out input volume was set to 0
2006-05-18T13:51:00.000Z	hastesaver	Kane666	look in Audacity
2006-05-18T13:52:00.000Z	Kane666	hastesaver	lol yeh that fixed it ;)
2006-05-18T13:54:00.000Z	Kane666	hastesaver	do you know how to adjust the esd settings?
2006-05-18T13:55:00.000Z	hastesaver	Kane666	not offhand (I'm not using Gnome or esd); look in the menu at the top (Preferences -> sound server or something like that)
2006-05-18T13:56:00.000Z	Kane666	hastesaver	nah i couldn't find it.. i'll just google it. thanks anyway
2006-05-18T13:56:00.000Z	Kane666	hastesaver	whats it called... adjusting esd what?
2006-05-18T14:02:00.000Z	Kane666	hastesaver	do you know anything about proxy servers?
