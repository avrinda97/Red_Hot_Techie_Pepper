2005-07-01T16:07:00.000Z	netsurf		ok i am helping a friend install ubuntu 64bit to an external harddrive that runs via usb ide adaptor the install is perfect but for some reason the grub bootloader cannot mount the partion a code 17 error the system has 4 hd 2 one 74gb raptor (hd0) raid stripe (hd1) and the usb hd that the computer is installing to (hd2) install works fine as i said but will not mount partition gets no further than that
2005-07-01T16:07:00.000Z	netsurf		seveas: sorry
2005-07-01T16:09:00.000Z	concept10	netsurf	you may need to search for answers on that.  Your system has to be able to recognize a USB drive from boot.  Check the BIOS for boot from USB settings
2005-07-01T16:09:00.000Z	netsurf		how do you mean?
2005-07-01T16:10:00.000Z	netsurf		i have been looking elsewhere first
2005-07-01T16:10:00.000Z	netsurf		i find no likeness of it
2005-07-01T16:11:00.000Z	netsurf		ya it did
2005-07-01T16:11:00.000Z	netsurf		it was detected as /dev/sdd
2005-07-01T16:11:00.000Z	concept10	netsurf	for example.  When you power your computer on, and it goes over to GRUB, your hardware needs to be able to recognize a USB drive (have drivers in memory)
2005-07-01T16:11:00.000Z	concept10	netsurf	I tried to boot from a external USB - unsuccesful
2005-07-01T16:12:00.000Z	netsurf		hmm
2005-07-01T16:12:00.000Z	concept10	netsurf	make life easier for yourself, install on internal drive
2005-07-01T16:12:00.000Z	netsurf		ok
2005-07-01T16:13:00.000Z	concept10	netsurf	and use the external drive for backup/storage etc
2005-07-01T16:13:00.000Z	netsurf		ok
2005-07-01T16:14:00.000Z	netsurf		concept so what difference is there between the grub and lilo?
2005-07-01T16:15:00.000Z	netsurf		lol
2005-07-01T16:15:00.000Z	concept10	netsurf	there are many differences.  search on that, grub is more configurable
2005-07-01T16:16:00.000Z	concept10		I hate the way grub names the drives and partitions, but thats my only complaint about it
2005-07-01T16:17:00.000Z	netsurf		only thing i hate about grub is that i use suse and it uses the big glossy pictures which cause problems if something changes
2005-07-01T16:17:00.000Z	concept10	netsurf	you can change that
2005-07-01T16:17:00.000Z	netsurf	concept10	SUPER
