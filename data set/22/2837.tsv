2009-02-15T09:51:00.000Z	n2diy		I need help getting Audacity to play with my microphone. Confirmed the mic is ok, and Audacity plays stuff, but I can't get it to record from my mic. I triple checked my Audacity and Volume appelet control/settings, still no joy, ideas?
2009-02-15T09:51:00.000Z	jon23d	n2diy	what audio system are you using?
2009-02-15T09:52:00.000Z	n2diy	jon23d	oos?
2009-02-15T09:53:00.000Z	jon23d	n2diy	does your mic work with other stuff?
2009-02-15T09:54:00.000Z	n2diy	jon23d	yes, confirmed it with my digi tape recorder.
2009-02-15T09:54:00.000Z	jon23d	n2diy	what about sound recorder in the sound and video menu?
2009-02-15T09:55:00.000Z	n2diy	jon23d	just tried that, no joy.
2009-02-15T09:55:00.000Z	jon23d	n2diy	have you checked the volume settings?
2009-02-15T09:57:00.000Z	n2diy	jon23d	I've triple checked the Audacity and audio applet settings, I haven't checked my bios, would my bios be involved? The sound card is onboard the mom board.
2009-02-15T09:59:00.000Z	jon23d	n2diy	I've had a ton of trouble with that with quite a few apps, usually it is because the mic boost needs to be on and the the audio recording toggle needs to be on
2009-02-15T10:00:00.000Z	n2diy	jon23d	Roger that. I've worked through this problem on other system before, with success, but now I've hit a brick wall.
2009-02-15T10:00:00.000Z	jon23d	n2diy	maybe try changing sound systems, or wrapping the software in another one
2009-02-15T10:00:00.000Z	jon23d	n2diy	I've had to do the wrapping for skype a few times
2009-02-15T10:01:00.000Z	jon23d	n2diy	or was it vmware...
2009-02-15T10:01:00.000Z	n2diy	jon23d	If I had a sound card laying around I'd try that. what's wrapping?
2009-02-15T10:02:00.000Z	jon23d	n2diy	honestly I don't remember -- but there is a command you use to force a program to use a different audio system
2009-02-15T10:02:00.000Z	jon23d	n2diy	here
2009-02-15T10:02:00.000Z	jon23d	n2diy	I kept a record
2009-02-15T10:02:00.000Z	jon23d	n2diy	sudo -i
2009-02-15T10:03:00.000Z	n2diy	jon23d	Thanks, but I'm using oss. :)
2009-02-15T10:10:00.000Z	jon23d	n2diy	cheers to that
2009-02-15T10:11:00.000Z	n2diy	jon23d	:)
