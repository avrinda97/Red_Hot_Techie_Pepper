2008-10-20T06:21:00.000Z	Decepticon		geforce fx 5200 agp
2008-10-20T06:21:00.000Z	Decepticon		huh?!
2008-10-20T06:22:00.000Z	Decepticon		so what should i do
2008-10-20T06:22:00.000Z	Decepticon		i have a geforce fx 5500
2008-10-20T06:22:00.000Z	Decepticon		with svideo out as well
2008-10-20T06:22:00.000Z	cafuego	Decepticon	That card should work fine with the close-source nvidia driver installed.
2008-10-20T06:22:00.000Z	Decepticon	cafuego	thats nice but i need to install ubuntu first
2008-10-20T06:23:00.000Z	cafuego	Decepticon	Can you flip to console (alt-F1) ?
2008-10-20T06:23:00.000Z	Decepticon	cafuego	i havent tried, but i bet it would work, because i can defintlye see output on the tv from bootup (bios post etc)
2008-10-20T06:24:00.000Z	cafuego	Decepticon	Yeah, it lacks that driver.
2008-10-20T06:24:00.000Z	Decepticon	cafuego	will ubuntu 8.10 support it
2008-10-20T06:24:00.000Z	cafuego	Decepticon	... so it defaults to vesa.
2008-10-20T06:24:00.000Z	cafuego	Decepticon	based on what snuxoll says, I wouldn't count on it.
2008-10-20T06:25:00.000Z	cafuego	Decepticon	it will, use the alternate cd - which can run in text mode.
2008-10-20T06:26:00.000Z	Decepticon	cafuego	ok so thats another download i gotta do?
2008-10-20T06:26:00.000Z	cafuego	Decepticon	Yup... and you really don't have any guarantee that it'll work :-(
2008-10-20T06:27:00.000Z	cafuego	Decepticon	no commercial reason for them to
2008-10-20T06:28:00.000Z	cafuego	Decepticon	Drop support, force upgrades, increase sales, limit development requirements...
2008-10-20T06:28:00.000Z	cafuego	Decepticon	... why does any proprietary corp drop support...
