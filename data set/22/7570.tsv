2006-04-18T11:19:00.000Z	dj_		Hello everyone, my first IRC chat using Ubuntu.  is anyone able to explain in simple terms, how to copy cds?
2006-04-18T11:21:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	- there are several cd burning programs, i think serpentine is the default one for 5.10
2006-04-18T11:22:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	- my bad, serpentine doesn't do exact copies of cds, is that what you want to do?
2006-04-18T11:28:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	- yes, it works fine
2006-04-18T11:37:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	i would install them with either synaptic or apt-get, have you used those two programs before?
2006-04-18T11:38:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	they should be installed already, and they are programs that you use to install OTHER programs
2006-04-18T11:39:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	look in your system menu, under 'Administration' and it's called synaptic package manager
2006-04-18T11:41:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	- ok, search for k3b, check mark it and 'apply' the changes with the button
2006-04-18T11:47:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	it didnt find k3b? hold on...
2006-04-18T11:53:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	- i'm not sure why synaptic didnt find k3b, are you sure you typed it write? it took me a full year to call the program k3b, and not kb3.
2006-04-18T11:56:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	i use the search button
2006-04-18T11:57:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	no, just serach be name
2006-04-18T12:00:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	it get its info from the same place, we may need to add some repositories to synaptic
2006-04-18T12:00:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	- go to settings, repositories....
2006-04-18T12:01:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	then click '+ADD' button
2006-04-18T12:02:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	make sure the bottom two checkboxes are checked, as well as the others on the top
2006-04-18T12:03:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	- ok, are they checked? multiverse and universe? click 'ok' and 'ok' again
2006-04-18T12:05:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	check mark it, and 'apply' button
2006-04-18T12:09:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	- you dont live in amsterdam do you?
2006-04-18T12:10:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	- lol, nevermind then. ;)
2006-04-18T12:12:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	never heard of either of them, and I like trance music, i usually more goa/psy
2006-04-18T12:32:00.000Z	ddonky	dj_	you got a webpage or mixes available on the 'net?
