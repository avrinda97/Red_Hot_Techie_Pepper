2010-11-08T23:37:00.000Z	juboba		How can I remove the ^M characters in a bash script? Vim does not show them :S
2010-11-08T23:37:00.000Z	trism	juboba	the tofrodos package has a fromdos command that with remove the carriage returns
2010-11-08T23:38:00.000Z	trism	juboba	vim can remove them too, but I forget the key combination for ^M
2010-11-08T23:39:00.000Z	juboba	trism	Vim should show them right? I'd like to write scripts and run them
2010-11-08T23:45:00.000Z	trism	juboba	yes, it should show them if they are there
2012-06-01T03:30:00.000Z	trism	juboba	the extensions for that ppa have been combined into a single package for gnome 3.4 (at least last time I checked), try installing gnome-shell-extensions instead
2012-06-01T03:31:00.000Z	juboba	trism	user themes is not available to select from the prefs dialog
2012-06-01T03:31:00.000Z	trism	juboba	did you restart gnome-shell?
2012-06-01T03:31:00.000Z	trism	juboba	you need to restart it after installing extensions
2012-06-01T03:32:00.000Z	juboba	trism	I couldn't install the extension
2012-06-01T03:33:00.000Z	trism	juboba	sudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extensions; ?
2012-06-01T03:33:00.000Z	juboba	trism	I have it
2012-06-01T03:34:00.000Z	trism	juboba	and you restarted gnome-shell? alt+f2 r?
2012-06-01T03:34:00.000Z	juboba	trism	yes
2012-06-01T03:35:00.000Z	juboba	trism	yes
2012-06-01T03:35:00.000Z	juboba	trism	but I couldn't install the extension
2012-06-01T03:36:00.000Z	juboba	trism	The following packages have unmet dependencies:
2012-06-01T03:36:00.000Z	trism	juboba	I don't understand that part, the user theme extension is part of that package now, they combined all of the ones from the gnome-shell-extensions repository into a single package
2012-06-01T03:36:00.000Z	trism	juboba	the one that is left there is for gnome 3.2, and old, obsolete package
2012-06-01T03:37:00.000Z	juboba	trism	I should open gnome-shell-extension-prefs
2012-06-01T03:37:00.000Z	trism	juboba	gnome-tweak-tool or alt+f2 lg should show you what's installed
