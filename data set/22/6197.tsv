2006-12-03T15:28:00.000Z	fordboy0	gopp	 as little as I use windows (always _other_ people's PCs), I've had success with it every time.
2006-12-03T15:29:00.000Z	fordboy0	gopp	With EXT3 filesystem on my external USB anyway
2006-12-03T15:29:00.000Z	fordboy0	gopp	Is it EXT2/3?
2006-12-03T15:29:00.000Z	fordboy0		That sure is odd.
2006-12-03T15:29:00.000Z	fordboy0	gopp	I think default for Ubuntu is ReiserFS.
