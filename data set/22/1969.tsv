2010-01-12T00:21:00.000Z	Dravekx		okay... /var/www/ is owned by root, but I want to add the a new group to have full access to var/www/... how do i do that???
2010-01-12T00:21:00.000Z	usr13	Dravekx	Use symlinks to home dir.
2010-01-12T00:24:00.000Z	usr13	Dravekx	What?
2010-01-12T00:24:00.000Z	usr13	Dravekx	You don't symlink a group, you symlink a directory.
2010-01-12T00:25:00.000Z	Dravekx	usr13	i just want this group of users to have full access to the /var/www/ directory
2010-01-12T00:25:00.000Z	usr13	Dravekx	No you don't.
2010-01-12T00:25:00.000Z	usr13	Dravekx	What are you trying to do?
2010-01-12T00:26:00.000Z	usr13	Dravekx	You are running apache web server, right?
2010-01-12T00:26:00.000Z	usr13	Dravekx	What in /var/www/ are you wanting to share?
2010-01-12T00:26:00.000Z	Dravekx	usr13	I made a new group called www-admin... I added my admins to that group, I want them to have FULL ACCESS to the /var/www/ directory.
2010-01-12T00:27:00.000Z	usr13	Dravekx	 Are you serving webpages via apache from /var/www ?
2010-01-12T00:27:00.000Z	Dravekx	usr13	yes.
2010-01-12T00:28:00.000Z	usr13	Dravekx	Are they going to ftp in or ssh in or...?
2010-01-12T00:29:00.000Z	usr13	Dravekx	How many sites?  One or more?
2010-01-12T00:30:00.000Z	usr13	Dravekx	That is highly irregular... you  will have a bunch of  people all having access to 30 different sites?
2010-01-12T00:31:00.000Z	usr13	Dravekx	How many users?
2010-01-12T00:32:00.000Z	usr13	Dravekx	And those 3 users are already users on this server?  (They already have user accounts?)
2010-01-12T00:32:00.000Z	Dravekx	usr13	yes. they are admins like me, but I am the main admin.
2010-01-12T00:33:00.000Z	Dravekx	usr13	Iw ant them to have full access so I dont have to be on call 24/7 anymore.
2010-01-12T00:33:00.000Z	usr13	Dravekx	Well, it is highly irregular, I've never done it but suppose  you could just use chmod to change group owner to it.
2010-01-12T00:34:00.000Z	Dravekx	usr13	why is it irregular? I have 3 people in a new group that I want to have full access to a directory so they can admin too, so I dont hafta be on call 24/7 every effin second of the day.
2010-01-12T00:36:00.000Z	usr13	Dravekx	But like I said, you should just use symlinks
