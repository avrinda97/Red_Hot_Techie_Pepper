2008-07-10T22:32:00.000Z	pierrelourens		Does anyone know if the latest version of btnx works w/ hardy heron (as far as the MX revolution is concerned)
2008-07-10T22:34:00.000Z	monostone	pierrelourens	I have tried btnx with the 'Logitech USB G9 Laser Mouse' and it will not detect all the buttons. Nor those which aren't already detected initially by the xserver.
2008-07-10T22:34:00.000Z	pierrelourens	monostone	this is aggravating.  all it recognizes is scroll, left click, and right click.  do you know of any other solutions (besides btnx)?
2008-07-10T22:36:00.000Z	pierrelourens	monostone	I feel your pain.  I tried looking around with that project, and it's just a mess.  I've had no problems with any type of support / documentation for my hardware, except this mouse, haha.
2008-07-10T22:37:00.000Z	pierrelourens	monostone	with wine?
2008-07-10T22:37:00.000Z	monostone	pierrelourens	no, I have a dual boot system
2008-07-10T22:38:00.000Z	monostone	pierrelourens	but that still isn't what I want, i want to get this working completely from ubuntu
2008-07-10T22:38:00.000Z	pierrelourens	monostone	I agree, and it seems to have worked in the past and the project has slowed or something
2008-07-10T22:39:00.000Z	pierrelourens	monostone	there is an unresolved bug report on btnx-config's launchpad here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/btnx-config/+bug/246526
2008-07-10T22:41:00.000Z	monostone	pierrelourens	not good :( The strange thing is that i once managed to get 7 buttons working, all except the left/right tilt. Have you tried running xev from console, and test if xserver detects the buttons?
2008-07-10T22:41:00.000Z	pierrelourens	monostone	I haven't... do you have a link for that?
2008-07-10T22:43:00.000Z	monostone	pierrelourens	I also believe there is an issue with my mouse being a USB device, and running:  cat /proc/bus/input/devices shows that the input and event changes, breaking my xorg.conf configuration
2008-07-10T22:43:00.000Z	pierrelourens	monostone	I agree... i think the original problem lies in recognizing the mouse as a USB device
2008-07-10T22:43:00.000Z	monostone	pierrelourens	open a console and type: xev
2008-07-10T22:45:00.000Z	pierrelourens	monostone	and then?
2008-07-10T22:45:00.000Z	monostone	pierrelourens	I also have read about how the evdev driver has issues understanding  /dev/input/by-id/ and by-path/ symlinks, which is bad, since those symlinks are static and what i would need. Still i believe there is more to it then that
2008-07-10T22:46:00.000Z	pierrelourens	monostone	if only logitech could provide some software or answers :P
2008-07-10T22:46:00.000Z	monostone	pierrelourens	after executing xev, you should see a box where you can click inside, and the console will print info for the button, if it detects it. if not, nothing will ocurr
2008-07-10T22:47:00.000Z	pierrelourens	monostone	I'm pretty sure it recognizes everything but the back/foward buttons, thumb dial, and search button :P
2008-07-10T22:50:00.000Z	monostone	pierrelourens	check these sites out, they might help you somewhat maybe: http://meandubuntu.wordpress.com/2007/12/23/logitech-laser-g9-and-ubuntu/ and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=65471  I started around there and followed links, but for me nothing worked :(
2008-07-10T22:51:00.000Z	monostone	pierrelourens	I use a G9 but through there you see info about the MX series
2008-07-10T22:53:00.000Z	pierrelourens	monostone	thanks for all the help. now it's time for a sandwich, i'm done messing with this
