2010-07-16T23:00:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	xangua	how? Just click on it and the button displays a state change?
2010-07-16T23:01:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	xangua	when I click on those buttons, nothing at all happens.
2010-07-16T23:01:00.000Z	xangua	[4-tea-2]	you have to press enter to send an update
2010-07-16T23:02:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	xangua	Yeah, that's exactly what I want. But they don't seem to do anything.
2010-07-16T23:02:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	xangua	that's why I asked - if you click on those buttons, do they visibly change in any way?
2010-07-16T23:02:00.000Z	xangua	[4-tea-2]	like i said you need to press ENTER to send an update
2010-07-16T23:04:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	xangua	will those buttons give any visual feedback to their state when you use them?
2010-07-16T23:04:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	xangua	ie. can you see which accounts are going to be used, perhaps because the others are greyed out or something like that?
2010-07-16T23:06:00.000Z	xangua	[4-tea-2]	if you send and update and you don't want to send it to X accoun just clic on it and it will be grayed
2010-07-16T23:07:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	xangua	thank you. Doesn't work for me, I'll report the bug.
2010-07-16T23:07:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	xangua	I just wanted this bit of information, tyvm.
2010-07-16T23:13:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	xangua	just to add one more detail to my bug report, if you hover the mouse over those icons, does it change shape (to the hand with the pointing finger, perhaps)?
2010-07-16T23:15:00.000Z	xangua	[4-tea-2]	it doesn't
2010-07-16T23:15:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	xangua	ty

2011-10-17T17:08:00.000Z	xangua	[4-tea-2]	check if that ppa has or not oneiric packages
2011-10-17T17:08:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	xangua	it hasn't.
2011-10-17T17:08:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	xangua	and it doesn't seem to release the daily builds anymore, either.
2011-10-17T17:08:00.000Z	xangua	[4-tea-2]	what is your conclution then Â¿ ;)
2011-10-17T17:09:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	xangua	my conclusion is to ask whether someone knows something about it.
2011-10-17T17:09:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	xangua	you are very witty, though.
