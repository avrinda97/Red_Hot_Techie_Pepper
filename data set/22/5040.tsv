2009-02-26T08:34:00.000Z	mishu		Hi. I have a problem with my wireless driver. When I first installed ubuntu, after running Update, a wireless driver was auto installed, and it worked. Now, i thought i can make my wireless get better signal if i used a windows driver with ndiswrapper. Problem is, none of the windows drivers work properly, and i can't get the original driver that worked back.. the one from Ubuntu .. i'm on Intrepid... I've been trying all day, looking everywhere .. any ide
2009-02-26T08:34:00.000Z	mishu		as on how to get the driver that was installed by ubuntu on the first update?
2009-02-26T08:36:00.000Z	mishu		yea, i did .. but where do i look for the ubuntu wlan dirver, and how do i install it ? :)
2009-02-26T08:37:00.000Z	mishu		nope .. i tried uninstalling and rebooting
2009-02-26T08:37:00.000Z	mishu		not working
2009-02-26T08:38:00.000Z	mishu		Can anyone tell me where i can find the default ubuntu intrepid wireless driver ?

2009-02-26T08:42:00.000Z	tritium	mishu	calm down, please
2009-02-26T08:43:00.000Z	mishu	tritium	i'm calm, sorry if the way i wrote seemed anxious
2009-02-26T08:44:00.000Z	tritium	mishu	do you know which driver you're referring to?  Perhaps the name of the chipset, or the kernel module?
2009-02-26T08:45:00.000Z	mishu	tritium	from what i understood, ubuntu ships with a generic wireless driver ... i don't actually know the name of it (the one that worked) cause it auto installed on first update after i installed ubuntu
2009-02-26T08:45:00.000Z	mishu		sveakexx: realtek RT8187B... i got the original windows drivers, tried all of them with ndiswrapper .. none working properly
2009-02-26T08:45:00.000Z	tritium	mishu	there are various drivers, depending on which hardware you have
2009-02-26T08:46:00.000Z	tritium	mishu	for example, a kernel module named rtl8187
2009-02-26T08:46:00.000Z	mishu	tritium	is that in synaptic ?
2009-02-26T08:48:00.000Z	tritium		The file is /lib/modules/2.6.27-11-generic/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/rtl8187.ko, which is part of the linux-image-2.6.27-11-generic package.  You should already have it installed.
2009-02-26T08:48:00.000Z	mishu	tritium	thanks, i think that's what i need .. yes, i know, the driver was already installed .. but i got it overwritten
2009-02-26T08:49:00.000Z	tritium	mishu	then reinstall that package
2009-02-26T08:50:00.000Z	mishu	tritium	that's exactly what i'm doing now.. i just maked it for reinstallation
2009-02-26T08:50:00.000Z	mishu	tritium	if this works, thanks a lot
2009-02-26T08:50:00.000Z	tritium	mishu	sure
2009-02-26T08:52:00.000Z	mishu	tritium	dunno yet if it worked, but have to restart .. so bye, thanks again.
