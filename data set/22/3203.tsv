2008-11-13T21:50:00.000Z	tsunami		I am trying to setup my partitions to avoid grub 18 error (my bios is very old and needs the boot at the begining of the disk).  Will the guided partitioner do this automatically with ubuntu 8.10 or do i need to set it up manually?
2008-11-13T21:51:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	avoid grub ? means remove grub ?
2008-11-13T21:52:00.000Z	tsunami	south_korea	I am avoiding a grub error
2008-11-13T21:53:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	have you try, um.. rescue mode ?
2008-11-13T21:53:00.000Z	tsunami	south_korea	I have an empty disk
2008-11-13T21:53:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	have you try, you can re-install grub
2008-11-13T21:54:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	have you try, use live-cd(ubuntu)
2008-11-13T21:54:00.000Z	tsunami	south_korea	my grub needs its own partition
2008-11-13T21:54:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	have you try, bootable ubuntu-cd i mean
2008-11-13T21:54:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	yes
2008-11-13T21:54:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	of course it needs partition to install
2008-11-13T21:55:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	you just said you have an error when you boot your system right ?
2008-11-13T21:55:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	that means you need to re-install grub
2008-11-13T21:55:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	if you formatted your hard-drive already
2008-11-13T21:56:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	ok, so do you know how ?
2008-11-13T21:56:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	ok ok wait i missed your msg..
2008-11-13T21:57:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	hmm..;;
2008-11-13T21:57:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	ok now i understood
2008-11-13T21:57:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	:P
2008-11-13T21:58:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	make extra partition for it then ?
2008-11-13T21:59:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	to make extra partiton for grub, you need to use fdisk
2008-11-13T22:00:00.000Z	south_korea	tsunami	i meant to solve your problem, use console cmd, that will be better
