2008-04-23T00:56:00.000Z	iratik		How can i tell my system to use a different swap ... I suspect that using flash memory for swap space would be quicker than SATA .... so i'm wondering if i can use SD memory and that might be quicker than using the disk for SWAP... like cheap SSD ... any ideas?
2008-04-23T00:57:00.000Z	ompaul	iratik	your system should not really be using swap - and if it is remember that flash only has 10k or so writes to it
2008-04-23T00:57:00.000Z	iratik		800mb of swap currently used right now
2008-04-23T00:58:00.000Z	ompaul	iratik	do this >>free | grep Swap << what is the middle figure on that result

2008-04-23T01:00:00.000Z	iratik	ompaul	Swap:      6080560     590068    5490492
2008-04-23T01:01:00.000Z	ompaul	iratik	so the middle one is like 59 megs in use ...
2008-04-23T01:01:00.000Z	iratik	ompaul	no 590068/1024 is not 59
2008-04-23T01:01:00.000Z	iratik		its 576.23 mb

2008-04-23T01:02:00.000Z	ompaul	iratik	fine and the allotted space is vast Â - what are you running on that box that has it swapping so much - flash has about 10k writes before the chip dies so that would not be the best practice

2008-04-23T01:06:00.000Z	ompaul	iratik	I think you need to get your db indexed and http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/optimize-table.html  either that or get much bigger box and check out your normalisation it helps a lot
2008-04-23T01:06:00.000Z	ompaul	iratik	but this is not a mysql help channel so I guess you got to head to the #mysql one
2008-04-23T01:06:00.000Z	iratik		following all rules of normalization ... indexing is great (key efficiency is 98%)
2008-04-23T01:07:00.000Z	ompaul	iratik	then it looks like there is nothing for it but to get more hardware (that is off the top of my head)
2008-04-23T01:07:00.000Z	ompaul	iratik	if you can afford to restart mysql
2008-04-23T01:07:00.000Z	iratik	ompaul	did that earlier today when a runaway query brought the swap up to 1.5gb
2008-04-23T01:08:00.000Z	iratik	ompaul	thanks tho
2008-04-23T01:08:00.000Z	iratik		good info about the 10K writes on flash memory
2008-04-23T01:08:00.000Z	ompaul	iratik	yiou need a bigger box - throw some ram about it
