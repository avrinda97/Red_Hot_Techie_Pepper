2006-10-03T15:38:00.000Z	unfknblvbl		that was me
2006-10-03T15:38:00.000Z	unfknblvbl		i'll go look it up
2006-10-03T15:39:00.000Z	unfknblvbl		no they aren't
2006-10-03T15:39:00.000Z	unfknblvbl		they're a bunch of bums
2006-10-03T15:39:00.000Z	unfknblvbl		its okay mneptok i steered him clear !
2006-10-03T15:41:00.000Z	unfknblvbl		this file: /etc/resolv.conf but you need your primary DNS
2006-10-03T15:41:00.000Z	unfknblvbl		thats what i did to get my network working
2006-10-03T15:41:00.000Z	unfknblvbl		it was more so ubuntu/gnome was acting funny with my modem
2006-10-03T15:41:00.000Z	unfknblvbl		hence
2006-10-03T15:41:00.000Z	mneptok	unfknblvbl	changing /etc/resolv.conf will not help if he can ping google.com ;)
2006-10-03T15:42:00.000Z	mneptok	unfknblvbl	all resolv.conf does is give you the ability to access hosts by name. if he can *ping* by name, DNS is working.
2006-10-04T07:36:00.000Z	mneptok	unfknblvbl	.mov is usually QucikTime
2006-10-04T07:39:00.000Z	mneptok	unfknblvbl	my point is, you should be using "apt-cache search quicktime" ;)
2006-10-04T07:42:00.000Z	mneptok	unfknblvbl	libquicktime0 - A library for reading and writing Quicktime files  <--- looks rather promising, eh? ;)
2006-10-04T07:44:00.000Z	mneptok	unfknblvbl	be aware, Apple changes their codecs about every 12 minutes, so libquicktime will allow playback of some stuff, but not every .mov you find.
2006-10-04T07:44:00.000Z	mneptok	unfknblvbl	exactly.
2006-10-04T07:45:00.000Z	mneptok	unfknblvbl	if i ever snap and drive to Apple HQ with the RPG, i'll pick you up on the way.
2006-10-04T07:59:00.000Z	unfknblvbl	mneptok	mplayer works beautifully
2006-10-04T07:59:00.000Z	mneptok	unfknblvbl	smashing.
2006-10-04T08:00:00.000Z	unfknblvbl	mneptok	i thought you would be excited
2006-10-04T08:00:00.000Z	mneptok	unfknblvbl	*almost* soiled myself. almost. ;)
