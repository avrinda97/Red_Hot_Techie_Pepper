2009-05-19T15:01:00.000Z	philsf	ActionParsnip	it's a troll, don't feed it
2009-05-19T15:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	philsf	it wont be eating for long
2010-08-18T00:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	philsf	press ALT+F2 paste or type: gnome-volume-control-applet    press enter
2010-08-18T00:09:00.000Z	philsf	ActionParsnip	thanks, the gnome one appeared, but this is not the one that used to appear
2010-08-18T00:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	philsf	then you need to find what volume applet you use, that program is the default applet for gnome
2010-08-18T00:10:00.000Z	philsf	ActionParsnip	I meant the indicator applet
2010-08-18T00:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	philsf	then right click the panel -> add item    then add the applet
2012-07-01T06:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	philsf	what netbook?
2012-07-01T06:22:00.000Z	philsf	ActionParsnip	asus 1005ha
2012-07-01T06:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	philsf	why was that not in your initial question?
2012-07-01T06:22:00.000Z	philsf	ActionParsnip	sorry for that. I didn't think it was relevant, since it's not a hardware problem, just a misconfig issue
2012-07-01T06:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	philsf	its the make and model of the system, so its very relevant
2012-07-01T06:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	philsf	what is the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh && ./alsa-info.sh
2012-07-01T06:25:00.000Z	philsf	ActionParsnip	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1068738/
2012-07-01T06:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	philsf	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-audio-dev/ppa; sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade; sudo apt-get --reinstall install linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils; killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*
2012-07-01T06:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	philsf	wait 10 seconds then reboot
2012-07-01T06:28:00.000Z	philsf	ActionParsnip	ok, will try. if this works, should I be able to revert to pristine packages instead of those from the ppa?
2012-07-01T06:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	philsf	the ppa givs you a later alsa which can help as the defaults are old, it may help. The command is from: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshootingProcedure
2012-07-01T06:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	philsf	I just re-jig it to be nicer
2012-07-01T06:30:00.000Z	philsf	ActionParsnip	ok, thanks. I'll return in a while to report.
2012-07-01T06:55:00.000Z	philsf	ActionParsnip	your tip worked. now jack sense works as expected. thank you very much
