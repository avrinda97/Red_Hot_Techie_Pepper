2006-10-09T10:22:00.000Z	holycow		your just doing the work for ms
2006-10-09T10:22:00.000Z	holycow		for free
2006-10-09T10:23:00.000Z	holycow		identify the component and fix it
2006-10-09T10:24:00.000Z	holycow		not possible, ubuntu as a whole doesn't exist
2006-10-09T10:24:00.000Z	holycow		if you crashed the kernel then th ekernel crashed
2006-10-09T10:25:00.000Z	holycow		ubuntu isn't crashing, your doing something dumb basically, pro bably running unsupported drivers on an unsupported video card
2006-10-09T10:26:00.000Z	bronaugh	holycow	that's pretty vanilla.
2006-10-09T10:23:00.000Z	holycow	bronaugh	ubuntu doesnt' cras, components crash
2006-10-09T10:23:00.000Z	bronaugh	holycow	I can't ping the machine now.
2006-10-09T10:24:00.000Z	bronaugh	holycow	ubuntu, as a whole, crashed.
2006-10-09T10:24:00.000Z	bronaugh	holycow	not even a kernel oops.
2006-10-09T10:25:00.000Z	holycow	bronaugh	your graphics driver is crashing
2006-10-09T10:25:00.000Z	holycow	bronaugh	why not fix that?
2006-10-09T10:25:00.000Z	bronaugh	holycow	if Xorg were crashing, I'd still be able to ping the machine.
2006-10-09T10:26:00.000Z	holycow	bronaugh	not necessarily but anywhoo :)
2006-10-09T10:26:00.000Z	bronaugh	holycow	Radeon 7000, stock Ubuntu. just installed.
2006-10-09T10:37:00.000Z	bronaugh	holycow	considering different distributions apply different patches to their software set, if one distribution crashes and another doesn't on the same hardware, I'm going to blame the distribution -- or specifically, the monkeys that allowed in the offending patches.
2006-10-09T10:37:00.000Z	holycow	bronaugh	in that case you would fit right in on #windows
2006-10-09T10:38:00.000Z	bronaugh	holycow	I'm fitting you into the "arrogant fool" category.
2006-10-09T10:39:00.000Z	holycow	bronaugh	i'm slotting you simply in th eidiot category
2006-10-09T10:39:00.000Z	holycow	bronaugh	it really isn't my fault you don't want to use the 3 braincels you were gifted with
2006-10-09T11:33:00.000Z	bronaugh	holycow	kind of hoping for it; but I have no idea whether it'll really happen.
