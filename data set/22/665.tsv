2011-05-26T17:36:00.000Z	sudokill		i think cos MS now owns it
2011-05-26T17:36:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	please don't be silly,
2011-06-10T02:35:00.000Z	sudokill	ikonia	explain the bug with realtek 8168 cards on linux that uses the 8169 driver by default. it completely kills the card until you reset the cmos
2011-06-10T02:35:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	because it changes the hardware status
2011-06-10T02:35:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	yes, as it changes the HARDWARE status
2011-06-10T02:35:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	nothing to do with the OS
2011-06-10T02:36:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	no
2011-06-10T02:36:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	the drivers are not shared, it changes the hardware status, that's why reseting the cmos changes the hardware status
2011-06-10T02:39:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	please don't
2011-06-21T22:21:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	extending partitions is risky, but in principal, yes
2011-06-21T22:21:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	data can get corrupted,
2011-07-01T21:44:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	easy there,
2011-07-01T21:44:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	if you have 2 minutes, jump into #ubuntu-ops and I'll explain
2011-07-01T21:45:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	the issue
2011-07-01T21:45:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	if you jump into #ubuntu-ops, we can talk about it
2011-07-01T21:46:00.000Z	sudokill	ikonia	its not just that. why are you so stirct in here for stupid things?
2011-07-01T21:46:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	please join #ubuntu-ops
2011-07-04T23:51:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	nothing - sudo -i is fine
2011-07-06T20:48:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	not massivly, but there are patches there
2011-07-06T20:50:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	yeah, that doesn't sound realistic
2011-07-10T22:53:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	stop it,
2011-07-10T22:54:00.000Z	ikonia	sudokill	if you're not going to offer proper advice, don't speak
