2011-12-27T19:12:00.000Z	sedeki	bullgard4	true, but where do I obtain this info then?
2011-12-27T19:13:00.000Z	sedeki	bullgard4	it even says "0:01 min until fully charged", then i pull out and it says it has critically low battery
2011-12-27T19:13:00.000Z	bullgard4	sedeki	I do not know what information you refer to speicifically. Probably you should read /var/log/dmesg.0.
2011-12-27T19:14:00.000Z	bullgard4	sedeki	Grep /var/log/dmesg.0 for ACPI events.
2011-12-27T19:16:00.000Z	bullgard4	sedeki	What is "it" in 'and it says it has critically low battery'?
2011-12-27T19:17:00.000Z	sedeki	bullgard4	i'm running gnome and there is a gadget in the menu bar at the top of the screen
2011-12-27T19:19:00.000Z	bullgard4	sedeki	There are more than one  gadgets in the menu bar at the top of the Ubuntu screen. --  What Ubuntu version / release do you use?
2011-12-27T19:21:00.000Z	bullgard4	sedeki	The message "ACPI: Deprecated procfs I/F for battery is loaded, please retry with CONFIG_ACPI_PROCFS_POWER cleared" is relevant. But I do not know a remedy. It is probably wise to repeat your question and this message in an Ubuntu mailing list.
2011-12-27T19:23:00.000Z	sedeki	bullgard4	ok, thanks. is disabling acpi a good idea otherwise?
2011-12-27T19:24:00.000Z	bullgard4	sedeki	No. ACPI is a complicated functional area. You might endanger overheating your computer, for example.

2011-12-27T19:54:00.000Z	bullgard4	sedeki	What time?
