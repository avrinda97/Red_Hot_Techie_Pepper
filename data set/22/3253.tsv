2010-03-29T22:06:00.000Z	lb1		but does *not* include Firefox 3.99-alpha7
2010-03-29T22:07:00.000Z	lb1		yeah, but they will also include 3.99-alpha7
2010-03-29T22:07:00.000Z	lb1		gentoo has to be compiled by the user, which is silly; will have to check arch
2010-03-29T22:07:00.000Z	lb1		well, in windows things happen like you describe
2010-03-29T22:08:00.000Z	lb1		once Mozilla releases Firefox 4.0, everyone just gets it immediately
2010-03-29T22:08:00.000Z	lb1		in ubuntu you have to wait for the next release cycle
2010-03-29T22:08:00.000Z	lb1		i.e. why second guess upstream decisions about stability?
2010-03-29T22:09:00.000Z	lb1		if a single upstream proves unreliable, then a policy to delay updates from them can be enacted, but only at that time
2010-03-29T22:09:00.000Z	lb1		btw, doesn't everyone see this problem?
2010-03-29T22:10:00.000Z	lb1		of course, you can somewhat work it around with ppas
2010-03-29T22:10:00.000Z	nDuff	lb1	having worn a Linux distributor hat in the past, let me just say that that wouldn't work in practice. Moving to a new gcc as soon as they say it's stable, for instance, suddenly creates a bunch of bugs in every other package, which take time to generate patches for, time to push those patches upstream, etc etc; chasing the bleeding edge is simply not feasible.
2010-03-29T22:10:00.000Z	lb1		ok for some system packages an exception should be made
2010-03-29T22:10:00.000Z	lb1		but the majority of stuff does not affect all packages
2010-03-29T22:11:00.000Z	lb1		i.e. a new version of firefox or openoffice can and should be immediately dropped in
2010-03-29T22:11:00.000Z	nDuff	lb1	...except that you-the-distributor have patches that you have applied to your firefox or your openoffice that need to be ported up to the new one
2010-03-29T22:11:00.000Z	lb1		well, you shouldn't
2010-03-29T22:11:00.000Z	nDuff	lb1	...and other packages (like flash) which depend on or interact with your firefox and openoffice...
2010-03-29T22:12:00.000Z	lb1		if you have so much patches that prevent you on releasing updates in a timely fashion, you should work on sending them upstream asap
2010-03-29T22:12:00.000Z	nDuff	lb1	...you shouldn't? So when your user has a bug that upstream is taking too long to fix but for which you've generated a working patch, you shouldn't include that patch until upstream takes it?
2010-03-29T22:12:00.000Z	lb1		yet firefox/flash upgrade just works in windows...
2010-03-29T22:12:00.000Z	lb1	nDuff	sure, but hopefully this shouldn't generally be a problem
2010-03-29T22:13:00.000Z	nDuff	lb1	this is off-topic here, and I'm going to stop discussing the thread, but I advise you to actually try working at a distributor to get an idea of what's involved before making pronouncements on how their business _should_ work in theory.
