2010-09-19T11:21:00.000Z	Balsaq		looks like a dual install
2010-09-19T11:21:00.000Z	Balsaq		but its not?

2010-09-19T11:22:00.000Z	gdb	Balsaq	Everything in Unix is a file.  Even your filesystem.  In the case of a loopback, the filesystem is contained inside a file in Windows.  That file (which contains your install Ubuntu system) is mounted as a loopback.  It's not a partition on a disk, it's a Windows file.

2010-09-19T11:23:00.000Z	Balsaq	gdb	hmm thanks, is it better than a dual partition?
2010-09-19T11:24:00.000Z	gdb	Balsaq	Well, it "shares space" with Windows, so I suppose in that sense it's better, but if the file is corrupted your SOL.  I don't use any sort of dual boot setups anywhere.
2010-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	Balsaq	gdb	what is SOL?
2010-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	Balsaq		o
2010-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	gdb	Balsaq	Sh*t out of luck.
2010-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	Balsaq		sheez
2010-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	Balsaq		haha
2010-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	Balsaq		wow i have a few dual booters
2010-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	Balsaq		i am in harms way huh
