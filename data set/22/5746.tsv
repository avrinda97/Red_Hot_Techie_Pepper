2008-04-23T23:55:00.000Z	arooni_		hey team!  i have a ibm t61 laptop.  recently, the battery wasn't charging even when plugged in.  so i had ibm send me a new battery.  i plugged that in and the battery still isn't charging.... ideas?
2008-04-23T23:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arooni_	bent pin inside the laptop or a blown charging circuit.. not uncommon
2008-04-23T23:56:00.000Z	arooni_	Jack_Sparrow	so you are pretty sure this is a battery problem?
2008-04-23T23:56:00.000Z	arooni_	Jack_Sparrow	i mean hardware problem
2008-04-23T23:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arooni_	not a battery problem.. charger or connection issue
2008-04-23T23:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arooni_	the os should not have anything to do with the charging circuit...
2008-04-23T23:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arooni_	your battery should charge without the laptop even turned on or running
2008-06-29T06:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arooni_	did you try what I suggested earlier
2008-06-29T06:40:00.000Z	arooni_	Jack_Sparrow	i'm sorry i don't know what you're referencing
2008-06-29T06:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arooni_	To get live cd to run this often helps..At start or install press F6 and remove Quiet and Splash from the command line. If it still fails.. Repeat and after removing quiet and splash add noapic acpi=off before the "--"
2008-06-29T06:40:00.000Z	arooni_	Jack_Sparrow	thank hyou
2008-06-29T06:40:00.000Z	arooni_	Jack_Sparrow	i selected safe graphics mode this time;.... is that likely to fail>?
2008-06-29T06:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arooni_	yes
2008-06-29T06:42:00.000Z	arooni_	Jack_Sparrow	is it safe to just hard reset comp now?
2008-06-29T06:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arooni_	on livecd.. yes
2008-06-29T06:42:00.000Z	arooni_	Jack_Sparrow	should the gutsy cd work with nvidia card?  or do i need to dload hardy
2008-06-29T06:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arooni_	It should work with hardy, most of my boxes still run gutsy
2008-06-29T06:44:00.000Z	arooni_	Jack_Sparrow	with the method you suggested :  i see: "invalid compressed format (err=1)  -- System halted
2008-06-29T06:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arooni_	did you self test the cd for errors?
2008-06-29T06:44:00.000Z	arooni_	Jack_Sparrow	nope
2008-06-29T06:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	arooni_	if trying to install on a dell or hp, burn the cd very slowly
2008-06-29T06:46:00.000Z	arooni_	Jack_Sparrow	i also have a ubuntu 5.10 cd .. should it handle nvidia cards?  and hopefully has badblocks installe don it?
