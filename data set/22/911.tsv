2012-06-05T11:19:00.000Z	amh345		evening guys. im feeling like im on crazy pills over here.  im trying to setup googles two-step auth on my server.  and it's all working like a charm until i leave it for 30 minutes and try to log back in. it never ends up accepting my password.  despite me testing and testing it beforehand.  im not sure whats going on.
2012-06-05T11:20:00.000Z	amh345		so im attempting another configuration on yet another server.   i read that keypair authentication needs to be turned off to make this work.
2012-06-05T11:21:00.000Z	amh345		is this the line i change to 'no' to turn off keypair auth? /etc/ssh/sshd_config  >>  PubkeyAuthentication yes
2012-06-05T11:21:00.000Z	amh345		is there anything else i need to do turn turn off keypair authentication?
2012-06-05T11:22:00.000Z	acicula	amh345	nope thats it, but pubkey authentication only works if you have a key set
2012-06-05T11:22:00.000Z	acicula		so if you do not have an authorized_keys file it wont work(for your account)
2012-06-05T11:22:00.000Z	amh345	acicula	i do have a key set. i initially connect with my keypairs. but i want to move away from that.
2012-06-05T11:22:00.000Z	acicula	amh345	why?
2012-06-05T11:22:00.000Z	amh345		could it be im actually forgetting my damn password.  every.single.time.i.test.this?
2012-06-05T11:23:00.000Z	amh345	acicula	im setting up google 2 step authentication
2012-06-05T11:23:00.000Z	acicula	amh345	with ssh?
2012-06-05T11:23:00.000Z	amh345	acicula	yes
2012-06-05T11:23:00.000Z	amh345		and i get it to work everytime i set it up. but whenever i come back to it a few hours later. i can never log back in.
2012-06-05T11:24:00.000Z	acicula	amh345	k, though you can just leave keybased authentication enabled in the deamon and remove the authorized_key and get the same effect. are you dissabling password based logons too?
2012-06-05T11:24:00.000Z	amh345	acicula	well it works with my user password.
2012-06-05T11:24:00.000Z	amh345		but the verification code is on my phone.
2012-06-05T11:25:00.000Z	amh345	acicula	PasswordAuthentication no  is set that way by default
2012-06-05T11:25:00.000Z	acicula	amh345	ah ok so it replaces normal tunneled passwords
2012-06-05T11:25:00.000Z	amh345		yeah. it's pretty cool.
2012-06-05T11:26:00.000Z	amh345	acicula	but not being able to login in later is driving me mental. i setup the server everytime i test it and get it working. then blamâ€¦.  cant get back in.
2012-06-05T11:26:00.000Z	acicula	amh345	weird
2012-06-05T11:26:00.000Z	amh345	acicula	i hate to think im screwing my password up every single time.
