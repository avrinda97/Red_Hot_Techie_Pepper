2008-12-18T05:42:00.000Z	eseven73	Scunizi	O.o i didnt know you could install lamp like that, good to know :)
2008-12-18T05:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	eseven73	there's other goodies in there too :)
2008-12-18T05:43:00.000Z	eseven73	Scunizi	yea i knew you could install LAMP with tasksel just didnt know bout synaptic cool beans
2009-01-03T05:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	eseven73	check out #vbox or their site.. I know that there is a solution to that.
2009-01-03T05:55:00.000Z	eseven73	Scunizi	yeah i think i have to install kernel source but it didnt work
2009-01-03T05:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	eseven73	install build-essential and dkms
2009-01-03T05:56:00.000Z	eseven73	Scunizi	on my 8.04 box i didnt even need anything to get guest additions working, i have build-essentail already
2009-01-03T05:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	eseven73	dkms keeps the kernel updated for vbox with kernel upgrades..
2009-01-03T06:09:00.000Z	eseven73	Scunizi	i still cant get vbox guest addtions working even with dkms or w/e it was http://paste.ubuntu.com/98672
2009-01-03T06:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	eseven73	do you have the kernel headers intsalled?
2009-01-03T06:11:00.000Z	eseven73	Scunizi	i have linux-headers like a lot of them
2009-01-03T06:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	eseven73	are you installing the guest additions into a linux guest?
2009-01-03T06:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	eseven73	ah.. I've done this.. but I'm not sure if I remember if this is actually what I did or not.  In the guest ctrl+alt+F2 and log in.. now sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop .. cd to the location of the guest additions file and run it from there..
2009-01-03T06:14:00.000Z	eseven73	Scunizi	how to do ctrl-alt-F2 in vbox?
2009-01-03T06:15:00.000Z	Scunizi	eseven73	once the os is loaded and focus is on the vm then you should be able to do it.
2009-01-03T06:16:00.000Z	eseven73	Scunizi	yeah but you cant type ctrol_+alt+f2 in vbox without it logging you out from host as well i made tha tmistake once lol
2009-01-03T06:16:00.000Z	Scunizi	eseven73	hang on .. loading kubuntu vm 8.10
2009-01-03T06:21:00.000Z	Scunizi	eseven73	ok.. :)  you're RIGHT!  weird.. I even tried to open a terminal and stop gdm from there and that works but doesn't drop me to a command prompt.  Sorry I'm stuck.. unless on boot you boot to rescue mode which is terminal based..
2009-01-03T06:22:00.000Z	eseven73	Scunizi	i got auto-login enabled how do i shut that off?
2009-01-03T06:22:00.000Z	Scunizi	eseven73	I think you have to shut the vm down then go into settings in the vbox control panel/box
2009-01-03T06:23:00.000Z	eseven73	Scunizi	no i choose auto-login from when i was installing 8.10 vm, its not a vbox thing
2009-01-03T06:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	eseven73	I understand .. still.. once you get to the menu with the different vm's highlight your's and click settings.
