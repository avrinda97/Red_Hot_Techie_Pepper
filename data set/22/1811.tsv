2010-01-04T07:54:00.000Z	Xfact	blakkheim	: "Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly" I am just obeying this rule.....
2010-01-07T09:43:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xfact	avoid ati if you want to use linux
2010-01-07T09:44:00.000Z	Xfact	blakkheim	but it only serving ATI graphic cards...:(
2010-01-07T09:47:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xfact	build your own system and use nvidia, much better for linux
2010-01-07T09:51:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xfact	that is ridiculous
2010-01-07T09:52:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xfact	you could build the same system for much cheaper, you are getting ripped off
2010-01-07T09:53:00.000Z	Xfact	blakkheim	my dad buying for me, my dad have a lots of 'trust' on DELL! (I really don't know why! :-X)
2010-01-08T00:15:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xfact	cool story bro, what do you want us to do?
2010-01-08T00:17:00.000Z	Xfact	blakkheim	well, nothing just do your 'help jobs' batter to rescue people from attack of bad koala!
2010-01-08T00:19:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xfact	if stability is your main concern, why don't you use something like debian or freebsd?
2010-01-08T00:21:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xfact	debian and freebsd have great support. i think you should give debian a try if you need stability over the latest versions of things
2010-01-08T00:23:00.000Z	Xfact	blakkheim	but my Friend suggest me to use Ubuntu and I heard currently it's the most famous linux distro of all time...
2010-01-08T00:24:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xfact	it is the most POPULAR. it's based on debian and made more user-friendly. debian is rock solid.
2010-01-08T00:26:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xfact	they both have support and wikis
2010-01-08T00:27:00.000Z	Xfact	blakkheim	thanks for suggestion but I think I am happy now with Ubuntu....later I would try...
2010-01-10T07:53:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xfact	cpu scaling
2010-01-10T07:55:00.000Z	Xfact	blakkheim	that means my karmic running only with 1000MHZ cpu....
