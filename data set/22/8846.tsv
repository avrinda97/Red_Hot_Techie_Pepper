2005-05-06T11:25:00.000Z	Astinus_		so where was i ahh yes, x config
2005-05-06T11:25:00.000Z	Astinus_		so there are no tools in Gnome for setting monitor type. What about Kubuntu? :)
2005-05-06T11:26:00.000Z	Lathiat	Astinus_	unfortunately not at the moment, what is your problem?
2005-05-06T11:26:00.000Z	Astinus_	Lathiat	monitor not detected --> wrong refresh rate
2005-05-06T11:27:00.000Z	Lathiat	Astinus_	for a start it'd be good to file a bug so we can fix it in future
2005-05-06T11:27:00.000Z	Lathiat	Astinus_	secondly, umm, do you have the monitor for it?
2005-05-06T11:27:00.000Z	Astinus_	Lathiat	the monitor tackles it but it wasn't detected.
2005-05-06T11:27:00.000Z	Lathiat	Astinus_	(btw is this on a new install, or have you changed the monito)
2005-05-06T11:27:00.000Z	Astinus_	Lathiat	new install.
2005-05-06T11:28:00.000Z	Lathiat	Astinus_	right, what type of monitor?
2005-05-06T11:28:00.000Z	Astinus_	Lathiat	IBM
2005-05-06T11:28:00.000Z	Lathiat	Astinus_	ibm what :), at least crt/lcd woudl be nice, model even better :)
2005-05-06T11:28:00.000Z	Astinus_	Lathiat	don't remember :( ibm 17" crt 6547 i think
2005-05-06T11:29:00.000Z	Lathiat	Astinus_	ok, hang a tick, and i'll come back and help you fix that
2005-05-06T11:29:00.000Z	Astinus_	Lathiat	ok
2005-05-06T11:36:00.000Z	Astinus_	Lathiat	i figured it out
2005-05-06T11:36:00.000Z	Lathiat	Astinus_	sweet, whatd you do?
2005-05-06T11:36:00.000Z	Astinus_	Lathiat	the monitor isn't - by specs - meant to run on the resolution i was trying but i had done it by force in windows.
2005-05-06T11:37:00.000Z	Astinus_	Lathiat	another issue, is it possible to disable all sounds in gnome in one operation?
2005-05-06T11:37:00.000Z	Lathiat	Astinus_	uh
2005-05-06T11:37:00.000Z	Astinus_	Lathiat	ok nicey.
2005-05-06T11:38:00.000Z	Astinus_	Lathiat	and finally, hda2 is an ntfs partiton .. ubuntu does not seem to automount it, do i have to edit the fstab file manually ?
