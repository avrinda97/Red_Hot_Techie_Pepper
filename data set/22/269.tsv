2012-07-26T16:10:00.000Z	gribouille		can someone tell me what happens with the following :
2012-07-26T16:10:00.000Z	gribouille		Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use%
2012-07-26T16:10:00.000Z	gribouille		/dev/loop0             22G   20G   13M 100%
2012-07-26T16:11:00.000Z	njaxx	gribouille	Thats very strange, are you connected to a SAN or directly attached FC disk array?
2012-07-26T16:11:00.000Z	gribouille	njaxx	no
2012-07-26T16:12:00.000Z	njaxx	gribouille	Internal disk?
2012-07-26T16:12:00.000Z	gribouille	njaxx	yes
2012-07-26T16:13:00.000Z	njaxx	gribouille	What version of the OS are you running?
2012-07-26T16:14:00.000Z	gribouille	njaxx	oneiric
2012-07-26T16:15:00.000Z	njaxx	gribouille	I think you may have a reserved 2GB of disk space for root.  Thats why your disk is reporting 100% full.
2012-07-26T16:16:00.000Z	gribouille	njaxx	how can I verify this?
2012-07-26T16:18:00.000Z	njaxx	gribouille	I'm just checking, 2 secs..... working on GPRS here.
2012-07-26T16:28:00.000Z	njaxx	gribouille	sudo tune2fs -m 1 /dev/loop0    (That would move the reserved blocks to 1 percent)
2012-07-26T16:29:00.000Z	gribouille	njaxx	ok, I'll try it
2012-07-26T16:31:00.000Z	njaxx	gribouille	Let me know if this works for you.
2012-07-26T16:35:00.000Z	gribouille	njaxx	ok, there is more free space now
2012-07-26T16:36:00.000Z	njaxx	gribouille	Thanks for the feedback.
2012-07-26T16:41:00.000Z	njaxx	gribouille	The discrepancy was caused by reserved space.
2012-07-26T16:42:00.000Z	gribouille	njaxx	ssta : does the 'Size' of df output include the reserved size?
2012-07-26T16:43:00.000Z	njaxx	gribouille	It already has reserved space deducted from the percent free.  Hence why 100% full even though you appeared to have 2GB free.
2012-07-26T16:50:00.000Z	njaxx	gribouille	Try calculating in blocks, not GiB or GB.  You might be seeing a rounding issue.
