2009-04-26T23:37:00.000Z	Clinteger		How do I fix my bootloader to boot Windows 7 installed on a second drive, with Ubuntu installed on the first?
2009-04-26T23:38:00.000Z	Vinconzo	Clinteger	add it in grub.
2009-04-26T23:39:00.000Z	Clinteger	Vinconzo	but I'm thinking that Windows 7 doesn't have its bootloader installed anywhere... and how do I find out what partition number it is?
2009-04-26T23:39:00.000Z	Vinconzo	Clinteger	sorry kinda hard description if you are new to linux
2009-04-26T23:39:00.000Z	Vinconzo	Clinteger	what's the partitions name in /dev/?
2009-04-26T23:39:00.000Z	Clinteger	Vinconzo	I'm not really new to linux, but I think 7 added on to Vista's bootcfg, which was removed when i installed ubuntu over vista
2009-04-26T23:40:00.000Z	Vinconzo	Clinteger	hold on a few seconds. It's the 2nd partition on the 1st drive, right?
2009-04-26T23:41:00.000Z	Clinteger	Vinconzo	no.. Ubuntu: 1st drive [whole], 2nd drive contains a ntfs data partition, and another ntfs with windows 7
2009-04-26T23:43:00.000Z	Vinconzo	Clinteger	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/158742/ add this to grub
2009-04-26T23:43:00.000Z	Clinteger	Vinconzo	but it wouldn't be hd0 would it?
2009-04-26T23:44:00.000Z	Vinconzo	Clinteger	yes it would. grub uses BIOS names. a computer usually starts counting at 0. linux (not grub) is userfriendlier and shows 0 as 1 and as such starts counting at 1 ;)
2009-04-26T23:45:00.000Z	Clinteger	Vinconzo	but windows 7 is /dev/sdb2
2009-04-26T23:45:00.000Z	Vinconzo	Clinteger	then it should be (hd0,1)
2009-04-26T23:45:00.000Z	Clinteger		okay hehe
2009-04-26T23:45:00.000Z	Vinconzo		w8
2009-04-26T23:45:00.000Z	Vinconzo	Clinteger	hd1,1
2009-04-26T23:46:00.000Z	Clinteger	Vinconzo	yeah, okay :)
2009-04-26T23:46:00.000Z	Vinconzo	Clinteger	just think of hd* a-z as letters and do -1 on that
2009-04-26T23:46:00.000Z	Clinteger	Vinconzo	kk
2009-04-26T23:47:00.000Z	Vinconzo		well now
2009-04-26T23:49:00.000Z	Vinconzo		i have a computer with an intel i945 graphics chipset but it appears to be too slow to even run a 3d screensaver, let alone run a game. it works fine in Windows though so it's not that it's far too slow to do 3d graphics.
2009-04-26T23:50:00.000Z	Clinteger	Vinconzo	I don't know if this is going to work though, since grub is just passing it off to the windows bootloader, which I dont think is installed :<
