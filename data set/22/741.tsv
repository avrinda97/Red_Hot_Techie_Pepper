2011-04-12T23:01:00.000Z	pstewart	umassMan	you should be able to boot from a live cd, mount that drive and make changes to the startup scripts
2011-04-12T23:02:00.000Z	umassMan	pstewart	that makes sense...i don't have a CD on me atm though, there's no way to do it through the recovery partition it makes for you?
2011-04-12T23:02:00.000Z	pstewart	umassMan	can you boot to single user mode?
2011-04-12T23:04:00.000Z	umassMan	pstewart	what do i select during startup for that?
2011-04-12T23:04:00.000Z	umassMan		<--- new to Linux :(

2011-04-12T23:04:00.000Z	pstewart		should be applicable
2011-04-12T23:09:00.000Z	umassMan	pstewart	thanks for the tip, unfortunately it isn't working for me, unless i edited the startup line poorly...
2011-04-12T23:09:00.000Z	pstewart	umassMan	what version are you running?
2011-04-12T23:09:00.000Z	umassMan		i'll jsut wait till i can get my hands on a liveCD, i think that'll be considerably easier :)
2011-04-12T23:09:00.000Z	umassMan		10.04
2011-04-12T23:10:00.000Z	umassMan		i can get to the (initramfs) prompt, on bootup
2011-04-12T23:10:00.000Z	umassMan		is there anything i can enter here...?
2011-04-12T23:10:00.000Z	umassMan		i can prob just reinstall it, in all honesty, i didn't have too much on it
2011-04-12T23:10:00.000Z	pstewart	umassMan	do you have a recovery mode option in grub for your kernel version?
2011-04-12T23:11:00.000Z	umassMan		would i jsut wipe the whole partition, if i decided to do that?
2011-04-12T23:11:00.000Z	umassMan		ya, the recovery mode takes me to the same point and breaks the same
2011-04-12T23:11:00.000Z	pstewart	umassMan	:( live cd would be the best best (and easiest)
2011-04-12T23:11:00.000Z	umassMan		the last line is talking about '...[sdb] Attached SCSI removeable disk'
2011-04-12T23:12:00.000Z	umassMan		and it just hangs there
2011-04-12T23:12:00.000Z	umassMan		stewart thanks for the tip, i'm not in a hurry really, i got sakoman working well on my BeagleBoard, that is the real victory :)
2011-04-12T23:13:00.000Z	pstewart	umassMan	np :)
