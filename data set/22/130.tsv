2012-06-08T18:50:00.000Z	omit		Hi again
2012-06-08T18:51:00.000Z	omit		My grub is broken. I tried a lot of tools (command line and boot-repair), but it fails
2012-06-08T18:52:00.000Z	omit		"chroot" fails when I try to use it to reinstall grub
2012-06-08T18:52:00.000Z	omit		it just doesn't respond after I run it
2012-06-08T18:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	omit	how about super grub live disk then?
2012-06-08T18:53:00.000Z	omit	sacarlson	haven't tried that yet
2012-06-08T18:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	omit	it shouldn't be much trouble to fix grub unless you have like efi or raid system or?
2012-06-08T18:54:00.000Z	omit	sacarlson	no efi or raid, just plain stuff
2012-06-08T18:54:00.000Z	sacarlson	omit	set your bios to boot from wrong disk?
2012-06-08T18:54:00.000Z	omit	sacarlson	the problem is that I can't even purge grub before trying to reinstall it
2012-06-08T18:54:00.000Z	omit	sacarlson	no. It broke after a xubuntu 12.04 grub update
2012-06-08T18:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	omit	install of grub2 should just scan for all bootable partitions and add them to be seen at boot, not much can go wrong
2012-06-08T18:55:00.000Z	omit	sacarlson	yes, but to install from the live cd I need to use chroot, which fails
2012-06-08T19:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	omit	and if it takes more than 2 - 3 hours to correct think about reinstall depending on the complexity of your system in some cases it ends up easier to just recover user data and do full reinstall
2012-06-08T19:40:00.000Z	omit	sacarlson	yes, but I just reinstalled a week ago and I always configure some stuff so it makes me lose a lot of time. I'd really like to fix it
2012-06-08T19:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	omit	in that case maybe better to learn to fix it then if it repeats
2012-06-08T19:43:00.000Z	omit	sacarlson	is there a way to umount /mnt even if it says that it's bus (I don't want to reboot the live-cd a 100th time...)
2012-06-08T19:43:00.000Z	omit	sacarlson	*busy
2012-06-08T19:43:00.000Z	sacarlson	omit	you must have a term that is cd'ed into it that makes it busy
2012-06-08T19:44:00.000Z	omit	sacarlson	nope :(
2012-06-08T19:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	omit	could try log out and in
2012-06-08T19:45:00.000Z	omit	sacarlson	yeps
