2005-12-12T16:08:00.000Z	yacc		Ok, what is the equivalent of postgresql-server-dev-8.0 in Ubuntu?
2005-12-12T16:09:00.000Z	yatesy	yacc	search for it?
2005-12-12T16:09:00.000Z	yacc	yatesy	Only debian packages available :(
2005-12-12T16:09:00.000Z	yacc	yatesy	no apt-file either in Ubuntu :(
2005-12-12T16:10:00.000Z	yatesy	yacc	http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy/misc/postgresql-8.0 that what you're after?
2005-12-12T16:15:00.000Z	yacc	yatesy	Probably not. I need the server developement headers.
2005-12-12T16:15:00.000Z	yatesy	yacc	how about http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy/libs/postgresql-8.0-plr then
2005-12-12T16:15:00.000Z	yacc	yatesy	Not the normal server, but the headers needed to compile server extensions against.
2005-12-12T16:16:00.000Z	yatesy	yacc	just look at http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=postgresql&searchon=names&subword=1&version=breezy&release=all and see if any of that helps :)
2005-12-12T16:18:00.000Z	yacc	yatesy	It's curious, the search, when I enter postgresql source package, finds all packages derived from that source. All packages are there, just postgresql-server-dev-8.0 is displayed without a link.
2005-12-12T16:18:00.000Z	yacc	yatesy	What does it mean when the search shows a package, but not linked?
2005-12-12T16:19:00.000Z	yatesy	yacc	i've got a link to that package?!
2005-12-12T16:19:00.000Z	yatesy	yacc	http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy/libdevel/postgresql-server-dev-8.0 ?
2005-12-12T16:21:00.000Z	yacc	yatesy	But this page doesn't have a download link for the .deb :(
2005-12-12T16:22:00.000Z	yacc	yatesy	apt doesn't find it either.
2005-12-12T16:22:00.000Z	yatesy	yacc	oh right :) just use synaptic and make sure you've got the universe respositories added
2005-12-12T16:22:00.000Z	yacc	yatesy	I do have.
2005-12-12T16:22:00.000Z	yacc	yatesy	And synaptic is just the gui.
2005-12-12T16:22:00.000Z	yatesy	yacc	ok use aptitude instead if you want CLI ;)
2005-12-12T16:23:00.000Z	yacc	yatesy	What's the difference to apt?
2005-12-12T16:25:00.000Z	yatesy	yacc	you SURE you have universe added?
2005-12-12T16:26:00.000Z	yatesy	yacc	just do postgresql and look through them just to be sure then
