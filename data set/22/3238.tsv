2009-01-26T10:08:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender		Ok, before I go and FUBAR anything, I've installed the 180 Nvidia driver ".run" from nvidia's site and would like some advice on installation ebfore I pull the trigger.

2009-01-26T10:08:00.000Z	tritium	[TK]D-Fender	use the ubuntu-packaged nvidia-glx-180
2009-01-26T10:09:00.000Z	tritium	[TK]D-Fender	plan B is above
2009-01-26T10:12:00.000Z	tritium	[TK]D-Fender	^^
2009-01-26T10:13:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	tritium	Yes.. I've noticed the repeat warnings :)  I'm backtracking now....
2009-01-26T10:16:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	tritium	cwillu, chiranka : Found the newly available package and its replacing 177 (173 remains).
2009-01-26T10:17:00.000Z	tritium	[TK]D-Fender	great.  If you have trouble with it, you can revert back the 177.
2009-01-26T10:18:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	tritium	Package and some dependant bits installed, but I don't see it available in the "proprietary drivers" selection app.
2009-01-26T10:18:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	tritium	Do I need to reboot?
2009-01-26T10:18:00.000Z	tritium	[TK]D-Fender	no, but you need to at least restart X (sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart)
2009-01-26T10:19:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	tritium	Just because IIRC that'll nuke enough of what I'm doing, I think I'll splurge and go for a reboot :)  Bank in a few...
2009-01-26T10:23:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	tritium	No dive... not in the selection box...
2009-01-26T10:24:00.000Z	tritium	[TK]D-Fender	it's not supposed to be in the selection box, as far as I recall.
2009-01-26T10:24:00.000Z	tritium	[TK]D-Fender	if you installed it, you're running it.
2009-01-26T10:25:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	tritium	Intersting.. the nvidia control dialog sure seems to attest to that...
2009-01-26T10:25:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	tritium	a tad awkward, but its the ends that count...
2009-01-26T10:25:00.000Z	tritium	[TK]D-Fender	ok, good
2009-01-26T10:26:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	tritium	Indeed my window decoration issues seem resolved so this was a great lesson on several fronts
2009-01-26T10:26:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	tritium	many thanks for the background info
2009-01-26T10:26:00.000Z	tritium	[TK]D-Fender	any time!
2009-01-26T10:27:00.000Z	tritium	[TK]D-Fender	there's not, but thanks for the consideration ;)
