2005-04-20T14:32:00.000Z	gurum0232		yes.... the thing is the website I need to visit requires SSL authentication using IE..
2005-04-20T14:32:00.000Z	gurum0232		Firefox is my love
2005-04-20T14:33:00.000Z	gurum0232		evilidler, but I doubt it would work with this site... it's pretty wincentric.. :D but thanks.
2005-04-20T14:35:00.000Z	gurum0232		my biggest gripe about linux.. not being able to remember how I fixed a certain thing.
2005-04-20T14:35:00.000Z	gurum0232		I mean who would be able to remember firewall settings..
2005-04-20T14:36:00.000Z	gurum0232		heh
2005-04-20T14:36:00.000Z	gurum0232		but with Ubuntu, I don't think I need pen+paper
2005-04-20T14:37:00.000Z	gurum0232		i mean I use linux for fun.. I don't want to take notes..
2005-04-20T14:38:00.000Z	gurum0232		i mean from 60 -> 85 is mandatory..but after that, you won't notice it.
2005-04-20T14:39:00.000Z	gurum0232		hmm..anyone ever tried vmware? what is the best guest OS under linux?
2005-04-20T14:40:00.000Z	daven	gurum0232	i have ubuntu as a guest ;-)
2005-04-20T14:40:00.000Z	gurum0232	daven	really? under vmware?
2005-04-20T14:40:00.000Z	daven	gurum0232	and win2k, debian (not quite working yet), rhel3 and suse9.2
2005-04-20T14:40:00.000Z	daven	gurum0232	fedora wouldn't work for me
2005-04-20T14:40:00.000Z	gurum0232	daven	what is your host OS?
2005-04-20T14:41:00.000Z	daven	gurum0232	my host os in winxp, but i don't see why it should be worse on linux?
2005-04-20T14:41:00.000Z	daven	gurum0232	sorry, you're right - didn't quite answer the question you asked ;-)
2005-04-20T14:43:00.000Z	daven	gurum0232	yeah, pretty fine (2GHz laptop with 2GB RAM)
2005-04-20T14:43:00.000Z	daven	gurum0232	i reckon you'd want getting on for a gig of ram for the host and a guest
2005-04-20T14:44:00.000Z	daven	gurum0232	i reckon 512 would be a bit tight :-s  would depend on your host os i guess
2005-04-20T14:44:00.000Z	daven	gurum0232	download the eval and try it out?
2005-04-20T14:44:00.000Z	gurum0232	daven	yes.. definitely.
