2009-11-07T14:49:00.000Z	guntbert	LiCeT	graphical login?
2009-11-07T14:50:00.000Z	guntbert	LiCeT	switch to CLI (ctrl+alt+F1)
2009-11-07T14:50:00.000Z	guntbert	LiCeT	yes :)
2009-11-07T14:51:00.000Z	guntbert	LiCeT	so on CLI you can login?
2009-11-07T14:52:00.000Z	guntbert	LiCeT	that means account and password are ok...
2009-11-07T14:53:00.000Z	LiCeT	guntbert	i need my gnome :D
2009-11-07T14:53:00.000Z	guntbert	LiCeT	have a look at /var/log/syslog - are there any errors connected with your login?
2009-11-07T14:58:00.000Z	LiCeT	guntbert	"/usr/share/gdm/guest-session/Xsession" requested_mask="r::" denied_mak="r::"
2009-11-07T14:59:00.000Z	guntbert	LiCeT	thats a new one for me - let me do a lookup
2009-11-07T15:08:00.000Z	guntbert	LiCeT	sorry, I couldn't find anything useful :-( - you could !pastebin a bigger part of the syslog and post the url along with your refreshed question - put it to the channel again as my resources seem to be unsufficient :-)
2009-11-07T15:09:00.000Z	LiCeT	guntbert	thx anyway...i'll do it later
2009-11-07T15:10:00.000Z	guntbert	LiCeT	Good luck :-)
