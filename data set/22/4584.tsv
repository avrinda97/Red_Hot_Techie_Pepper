2009-06-29T11:57:00.000Z	ChrisD		Hey guys
2009-06-29T11:58:00.000Z	ChrisD		Can anyone please help?
2009-06-29T11:58:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ChrisD	state your issue?
2009-06-29T11:58:00.000Z	ChrisD	qe2eqe	well, I just installed eeebuntu, but everything related to video performance lags
2009-06-29T11:59:00.000Z	ChrisD	qe2eqe	even when i switch desktops (I've got an eeebox b202, everything works out of the box, it just lags like hell)
2009-06-29T12:00:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ChrisD	 open terminal, type glxinfo | grep render
2009-06-29T12:00:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ChrisD	let me know the just of that line
2009-06-29T12:00:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ChrisD	let me know the jist*, even, i.e., summarize it if you must
2009-06-29T12:01:00.000Z	ChrisD	qe2eqe	no jist, just this "direct rendering: Yes
2009-06-29T12:01:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ChrisD	try running glxgears, does that lag?
2009-06-29T12:02:00.000Z	ChrisD	qe2eqe	60-100 fps
2009-06-29T12:03:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ChrisD	I think your problem is one of two things. Either you don't understand exactly how not powerful your netbook is, or a fan or duct or something on your machine isn't working, your processor is running slower to keep from crisping.
2009-06-29T12:04:00.000Z	ChrisD	qe2eqe	well, I ran a live cd of 6.10 on an AMD K6-2 400mhz with 384 ram and a 4 meg video card and it ran a lot smoother :(
2009-06-29T12:05:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ChrisD	=/. What's it?
2009-06-29T12:05:00.000Z	ChrisD	qe2eqe	maybe hardware acceleration if off or something?
2009-06-29T12:05:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ChrisD	hardware acceleration = direct rendering
2009-06-29T12:05:00.000Z	ChrisD	qe2eqe	I meant Ubuntu 6.10
2009-06-29T12:06:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ChrisD	i mean, whats slow
2009-06-29T12:06:00.000Z	ChrisD	qe2eqe	eh, I guess? Sorry haven't used Linux for a while now, but even xp runs a lot better, at least firefox scrolling doesn't lag like mad
2009-06-29T12:06:00.000Z	ChrisD	qe2eqe	well, everything except the terminal
2009-06-29T12:09:00.000Z	qe2eqe	ChrisD	I don't know what to say. I've never heard of eeebuntu. If you have an eeepc, I'd recommend modifying or at least learning defaults from the canonical eeepc distribution.
2009-06-29T12:10:00.000Z	ChrisD	qe2eqe	well it's a distro based on Ubuntu, it's just that they say everthing has been optimized for the eee series of netbooks, that is sort of true, everything works out of the box, even wifi, but X lags, even in Xfce4
