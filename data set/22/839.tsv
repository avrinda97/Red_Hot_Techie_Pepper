2011-02-20T21:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	MysterX	how did you installed the nv drivers?
2011-02-20T21:37:00.000Z	MysterX	erUSUL	it works with the latest nv drivers
2011-02-20T21:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	MysterX	i did not asked that; i asked how did you installed those drivers
2011-02-20T21:38:00.000Z	MysterX	erUSUL	i downloaded the drivers from the nvidia site and installed them...
2011-02-20T21:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	MysterX	well that explains... everytime there is a kernel or xorg upgrade you have to reinstall the drivers
2011-02-20T21:40:00.000Z	MysterX	erUSUL	.. hmm ok.. i will try that
2011-02-20T21:42:00.000Z	MysterX	erUSUL	i run the installer as we speak and tells me that there is already a driver installed... that doesn't matter?
2011-02-20T21:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	MysterX	tell it to procceed anyway
2011-02-20T21:43:00.000Z	MysterX	erUSUL	I have my doubts... whe shall see. ;)

2011-02-20T21:48:00.000Z	MysterX	erUSUL	thanks :D ... i am trying to get my HD movies run smooth... when i run them my processor is getting 100%.. so i have to make a change in xorg.conf.. option "NoFlip" "1" <-- is see this in my screen section now..
2011-02-20T21:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	MysterX	never used that option...
2011-02-20T21:51:00.000Z	MysterX	erUSUL	it's just not stable.. because my mouse is freezing sometimes and my movies keep playing on 100% cpu.. thats @$%%^^
