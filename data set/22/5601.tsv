2007-04-09T06:33:00.000Z	crane_	numan	did you stick the card back in and disable onboard?
2007-04-09T06:35:00.000Z	crane_	numan	Onse you do that and start back up, just  enter sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx in  teminal
2007-04-09T06:40:00.000Z	crane_	numan	sorry phone. Once you install the card in the system, then you run sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
2007-04-09T06:42:00.000Z	crane_	numan	2 things. did you disable onboard video and are you sure the card works.
2007-04-09T06:43:00.000Z	crane_	numan	if you don't disable onboard vid the card my not work.
2007-04-09T06:45:00.000Z	crane_	numan	Then you should be able to just install card and it will use it.
2007-04-09T06:45:00.000Z	crane_	numan	You say the vid did not work during install>
2007-04-09T06:47:00.000Z	crane_	numan	just make sure all connections are good. and try. If it does not work, do you have another card to use as atest?
2007-04-09T06:51:00.000Z	crane_	numan	OK, good luck.
