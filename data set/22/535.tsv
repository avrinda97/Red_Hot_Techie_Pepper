2011-08-04T21:29:00.000Z	wols_	jackalista	iwconfig. and this time: pastebin, not in the channel
2011-08-04T21:36:00.000Z	wols_	jackalista	is the AP you want to connect to listed?
2011-08-04T21:49:00.000Z	jackalista	wols_	u following this thread?  can u help?  edbian has left... I don't know how to turn off password on my access point, not sure I have the manuals anymore, it's several years old
2011-08-04T21:50:00.000Z	wols_	jackalista	so what error do you get when trying to enter the wpa password?
2011-08-04T21:51:00.000Z	jackalista	wols_	thx, it tries to connect for a few minutes and then the little dialog pops up that says that I am not connected.  is there a way to get a more verbose error msg?
2011-08-04T21:51:00.000Z	wols_	jackalista	I don't use or like network-manager so I don't know
2011-08-04T21:52:00.000Z	jackalista	wols_	what is network manager?  you mean the gui controls on the menu bar at the top oif the screen?
2011-08-04T21:53:00.000Z	wols_	jackalista	no. the software that manages network connections in ubuntu by default.
2011-08-04T21:54:00.000Z	jackalista	wols_	so... you don't know what's wrong?  network manager is what's failing?
2011-08-04T21:55:00.000Z	jackalista	wols_	you were talking about firmware, do u think that is a problem or not?
2011-08-04T21:55:00.000Z	wols_	jackalista	I asked you things, you never answered. so how would I know? I can't see onto your screen
2011-08-04T21:56:00.000Z	jackalista	wols_	sorry, what didn't I answer?  I am not expert at this (obviously)
2011-08-04T22:03:00.000Z	jackalista	wols_	you have no idea what to do to make this Intel® Centrino® Advanced-N 6205 connect?  didn't you mention firmware?  or would I not be able to see my network at all if that was the problem?
2011-08-04T22:04:00.000Z	wols_	jackalista	firmware is already installed and working. and I dunno about network-manager since I use /etc/network/interfaces directly
