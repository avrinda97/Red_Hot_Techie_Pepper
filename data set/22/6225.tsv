2007-03-03T10:40:00.000Z	riotkittie		oops. When I have the wireless card in, tty7 functions as it should but tty 1-6 will not come up. while i don't mind using X, i prefer operating outside of it. and being stuck in X grows grating. anyone have any ideas?
2007-03-03T10:41:00.000Z	riotkittie		sigh. at this rate, maybe i should just suck it up and start spending more time in xp :\
2007-03-03T10:41:00.000Z	eck	riotkittie	that is just strange
2007-03-03T10:43:00.000Z	riotkittie	eck	 i can ALT + CTRL + FKey but all i get is a black screen with nothing beyond a blinking cursor
2007-03-03T10:43:00.000Z	eck	riotkittie	chvt
2007-03-03T10:43:00.000Z	eck	riotkittie	are your getties running?
2007-03-03T10:43:00.000Z	riotkittie	eck	 no. theyre not. is there some command i can use to get them running ?
2007-03-03T10:44:00.000Z	eck	riotkittie	try starting one from your X session, i think it will work
2007-03-03T10:45:00.000Z	eck	riotkittie	something like: /sbin/getty 38400 tty1
2007-03-03T10:46:00.000Z	riotkittie	eck	executed that. only change is that instead of the blinking cursor, tty1 is now completely black
2007-03-03T10:46:00.000Z	eck	riotkittie	try stracing it
2007-03-03T10:50:00.000Z	riotkittie	eck	i cannot thank you enough. youre teh first person to give me a solution in the ~3 months i've been asking that question.
2007-03-03T10:50:00.000Z	eck	riotkittie	np
2007-03-03T10:50:00.000Z	eck	riotkittie	they should be set to start in your inittab though
2007-03-03T10:52:00.000Z	eck	riotkittie	but i am curious -- what is wrong with an xterm?
2007-03-03T10:58:00.000Z	riotkittie	eck	err. that's a tough one.
2007-03-03T10:59:00.000Z	riotkittie	eck	i suppose it's not so much there being anything wrong with xterms as it is not seeing a point of running X if all i'm doing is using a term. and for some reason, just finding it easier to keep things seperated.
2007-03-03T10:59:00.000Z	eck	riotkittie	and use an 80 character console?!
2007-03-03T11:04:00.000Z	eck	riotkittie	can you use dual head with virtual terminals?
2007-03-03T11:06:00.000Z	riotkittie	eck	err. that i do not know. my ancient, dual head ati is only supported in windows
2007-10-15T07:18:00.000Z	eck	riotkittie	look at gconf-editor, there's probably a gconf setting for it
2007-10-15T07:19:00.000Z	riotkittie	eck	i've been digging through it  :|
