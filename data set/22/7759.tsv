2006-09-17T11:50:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		am i up to date with this kernal "2.6.15-26-386"
2006-09-17T11:52:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		is this the latest stable Kernal for my comp 2.6.15-26-386
2006-09-17T11:52:00.000Z	jtibau	Paddy_EIRE	I got the same one, it's default for dapper
2006-09-17T11:57:00.000Z	jtibau	Paddy_EIRE	do you have a dual core processor?
2006-09-17T11:57:00.000Z	jtibau	Paddy_EIRE	mmm I think you can install a k6 kernel then
2006-09-17T11:59:00.000Z	jtibau	Paddy_EIRE	rather than standard options... It would be more appropiate for your cpu
2006-09-17T12:01:00.000Z	jtibau	Paddy_EIRE	give me a second and I'll try to find you some info
2006-09-17T12:11:00.000Z	jtibau	Paddy_EIRE	I was looking for some info but couldn't find any...
2006-09-17T12:11:00.000Z	jtibau	Paddy_EIRE	good. When you install a different kernel it doesnt mean you uninstall the other one
2006-09-17T12:12:00.000Z	jtibau	Paddy_EIRE	you just choose at the grub menu which kernel you want to use
2006-09-17T12:14:00.000Z	jtibau	Paddy_EIRE	it should work better and as the ubuntuforums post must have said it really doesn't mean you need to do anything differently
2006-09-17T12:14:00.000Z	jtibau	Paddy_EIRE	got confussed... I don't own an Athlon so I haven't had the chance to install that kernel... Just remembered there was that option
2006-09-17T12:59:00.000Z	jtibau	Paddy_EIRE	did you install the k7 kernel???
2006-09-17T13:00:00.000Z	jtibau	Paddy_EIRE	good to know then
2006-09-17T13:02:00.000Z	jtibau	Paddy_EIRE	I think there shouldn't be a drastic change in speed... From what I know, the more CPU intessive tasks as compiling and such should be faster now
2006-09-17T13:03:00.000Z	jtibau	Paddy_EIRE	if you use ubuntu I would suggest to stick to the software in the repos through apt-get
2006-09-17T13:04:00.000Z	jtibau	Paddy_EIRE	test software??? you can try downloading source code for something like gaim 2.0 beta
