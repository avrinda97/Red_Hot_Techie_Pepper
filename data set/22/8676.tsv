2009-07-29T04:23:00.000Z	spO		whenever i tried to install xwin on freebsd or openbsd like 7 years ago, i would always have problems or usually have problems with getting the video card right or what not and also getting the mouse settings to work right.... With ubuntu it works out of the box,   does freebsd and other oses still have problems installing xwin?
2009-07-29T04:23:00.000Z	spO		out of the box, ubuntu has xwins, rihgt?
2009-07-29T04:24:00.000Z	spO		how come ubuntu can get the confirugation for video card and mouse right but others cannot
2009-07-29T04:25:00.000Z	spO		openbsd has security and encryption enhancements, does ubuntu have anything like this, like for instance can you use blowfish?
