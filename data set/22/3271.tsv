2011-08-19T22:31:00.000Z	oly562		then switching back
2011-08-19T22:31:00.000Z	oly562		to ctr-f7
2011-08-19T22:31:00.000Z	oly562		next question:   how can i turn off software updates after doing an update, where the kernel sources keep asking me to update, for which i do not want to yet...? i come from redhat update and there was a config file that i could specify NOT to include kernel* updates?
2011-08-19T22:32:00.000Z	oly562		i already have my update set to not install/download whatever, but i did do a mild upgrade, without kernels,,, it keeps popping up, how to make it stop
2011-08-19T22:32:00.000Z	oly562		where is the update-manager conf file?
2011-08-19T22:33:00.000Z	oly562		whats zorin? sounds like something outta the movie "Big" with tom hanks
2011-08-19T22:33:00.000Z	oly562		oh wait that was zoltar
2011-08-19T22:34:00.000Z	oly562		whats a derivative rww?
2011-08-19T22:34:00.000Z	oly562		ah ic
2011-08-19T22:34:00.000Z	oly562		flavor?
2011-08-19T22:35:00.000Z	h00k	oly562	also known as that, yes
2011-08-19T22:42:00.000Z	h00k	oly562	if you want to ask, you can check in #freenode. Ops don't respond/prompt for failover, the servers handle the disconnection.
2011-08-19T22:44:00.000Z	oly562	h00k	i never said ops anything
2011-08-19T22:59:00.000Z	h00k	oly562	what are you trying to configure with update-manager?
2011-08-19T22:59:00.000Z	oly562	h00k	that right there
2011-08-19T23:01:00.000Z	h00k	oly562	in the update manager, click the 'settings' button, and then the 'Updates' tab
2011-08-19T23:03:00.000Z	h00k	oly562	perhaps try not having it check for updates automatically
2011-08-19T23:03:00.000Z	h00k	oly562	alternatively, install the updates
2011-08-19T23:03:00.000Z	oly562	h00k	thats been done already.. it still nags me about kernel
2011-08-19T23:04:00.000Z	h00k	oly562	Please settle. I'm only trying to help.
2011-08-19T23:04:00.000Z	oly562	h00k	please try understanding my question first, reread it, and if you have worked with redhat or up2date in the past, you will know what i am asking, no offense
2011-08-19T23:09:00.000Z	h00k	oly562	aptitude
