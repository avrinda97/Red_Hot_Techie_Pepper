2007-05-26T16:36:00.000Z	cy_		i would like to checkout the ubuntu server stuff :)
2007-05-26T16:36:00.000Z	cy_		easy xen and vmware-server installation
2007-05-26T16:37:00.000Z	cy_		and such :@
2007-05-26T16:38:00.000Z	cy_		and #ubuntu-server is like, dead..
2007-05-26T16:38:00.000Z	jmg	cy_	pretty risky to do that remotely
2007-05-26T16:39:00.000Z	jmg	cy_	do you have access to the remote console?
2007-05-26T16:39:00.000Z	cy_	jmg	i always have the "reinstall-default-system-button" and everything is backed up.. so .. not so much risk involved
2007-05-26T16:39:00.000Z	cy_	jmg	not physical.. no.. but as i just said, i have tehe button
2007-05-26T16:39:00.000Z	jmg	cy_	my suggestion would be to install to another partition
2007-05-26T16:40:00.000Z	cy_	jmg	ok.. but how do i install it.. without having access to the cdrom tray.. thats the big Q. :)
2007-05-26T16:41:00.000Z	jmg	cy_	it's called a cross install
2007-05-26T16:41:00.000Z	cy_	jmg	mmm.. so i should simpyl to the debootstrap using the feisty image?
2007-05-26T16:41:00.000Z	cy_	jmg	ok.. i'll note that..
2007-05-26T16:41:00.000Z	jmg	cy_	yes
2007-05-26T16:42:00.000Z	jmg	cy_	no guarantees that it will work, though
2007-05-26T16:42:00.000Z	jmg	cy_	follow the guide
2007-05-26T16:43:00.000Z	jmg	cy_	first wget and unpack the debootstrap deb
2007-05-26T16:43:00.000Z	cy_	jmg	okie dokies =)
2007-05-26T16:44:00.000Z	jmg	cy_	run it as suggested in the guide, with http://archive.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu
2007-05-26T16:46:00.000Z	cy_	jmg	ok.. i will do that.. still.. this will simply install a base system.. right ? .. will i then be able to do like apt-get install ubuntu-server.. because in the end of the guide they do something like: apt-get install '~tubuntu-desktop'
2007-05-26T16:46:00.000Z	jmg	cy_	absolutely yes :)
2007-05-26T05:02:00.000Z	cy_	jmg	the package "console-data" cant be reconfigured during the step " dpkg-reconfigure console-data" because it doesnt exist.. also the "base-config" command is missing.. any help on that one? ;)
