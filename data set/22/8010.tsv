2008-03-23T22:51:00.000Z	manuel__		could someone tell me which major and minor number have hda0?
2008-03-23T22:52:00.000Z	Flannel	manuel__	hda0 doesn't exist.  hda1 would be hd0,0; if that's what you're looking for.
2008-03-23T22:52:00.000Z	manuel__	Flannel	/dev/hda0
2008-03-23T22:53:00.000Z	manuel__	Flannel	well could you give major and minor numbers of any hd? please.
2008-03-23T22:53:00.000Z	manuel__	Flannel	not scsi
2008-03-23T22:54:00.000Z	Flannel	manuel__	/dev/hda0 *cannot* exist.  Linux starts numbering at 1, hda1 is the first harddrive, first partition.
2008-03-23T22:54:00.000Z	manuel__	Flannel	ok. it does not exist. may be /dev/hda1?
2008-03-23T22:55:00.000Z	manuel__	Flannel	i need the device numbers to create two nodes on an initrd image
2008-03-23T22:55:00.000Z	Flannel	manuel__	hda1 is hd0,0-- You take the linux one, convert the letters into numbers (a=1, b=2, etc) then subtract one from each.
2008-03-23T22:56:00.000Z	manuel__	Flannel	just a "ls /dev/hda*" will show you major and minor _device_ numbers
2008-03-23T22:57:00.000Z	Flannel	manuel__	I'm not sure I have any idea what you're talking about.
2008-03-23T22:58:00.000Z	manuel__	Flannel	do you know how to see files on a console (terminal)?
2008-03-23T22:59:00.000Z	manuel__	Flannel	xterm, gnome-terminal or something like that?
2008-03-23T22:59:00.000Z	Flannel	manuel__	of course.  I'm not sure I understand what you're looking for.
2008-03-23T23:00:00.000Z	manuel__	Flannel	doing "ls -l /dev/scd*" on my computer gives me:
2008-03-23T23:00:00.000Z	manuel__	Flannel	brw-rw---- 1 root cdrom 11, 0 2008-03-23 12:30 /dev/scd0
2008-03-23T23:00:00.000Z	manuel__	Flannel	i need the 11 and 0 but from an IDE disc, not scsi
2008-03-23T23:01:00.000Z	Flannel	manuel__	What version of Ubuntu are you using? (scsi disks are sd* not sc*)
2008-03-23T23:01:00.000Z	manuel__	Flannel	it is a cdrom
2008-03-23T23:02:00.000Z	Flannel	manuel__	If you're using anything post-dapper, all of your disks have been mapped to scsi, none are hd*
2008-03-23T23:02:00.000Z	manuel__	Flannel	i'm creating a filesystem to boot another system, that's why i need ide numbers
2008-03-23T23:03:00.000Z	manuel__	Flannel	so you don't have hd* either?
