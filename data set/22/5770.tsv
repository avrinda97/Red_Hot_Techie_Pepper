2007-02-28T09:14:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi		Need help installing 6.10 from dvd, 6.06 won't reconize dvd, but see's cd's and boots from 6.06 cd
2007-02-28T09:14:00.000Z	ikonia_	MarcoCeppi	is it a dvd drive
2007-02-28T09:15:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	ikonia_	yes it is
2007-02-28T09:16:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	ikonia_	it says dvd on the front; and in the disk manager for 6.06 it says dvd read. Is the dvd distro a live cd?
2007-02-28T09:16:00.000Z	ikonia_	MarcoCeppi	probably bad burns
2007-02-28T09:17:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	ikonia_	okay I'll reinstall and try again.
2007-02-28T09:28:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	ikonia_	worked, thanks.
2007-02-28T09:28:00.000Z	ikonia_	MarcoCeppi	cool
2007-02-28T09:37:00.000Z	ikonia_	MarcoCeppi	is it starting to boot and failing - or just not starting
2007-02-28T09:37:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	ikonia_	not booting at all
2007-02-28T09:38:00.000Z	ikonia_	MarcoCeppi	do you get the boot menu up for the dvd or will it not even read the cd at boot time
2007-02-28T09:38:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	ikonia_	it goes straight to grub, however if i put in 6.06 live cd in it boots
2007-02-28T09:38:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	ikonia_	no boot menu
2007-02-28T09:38:00.000Z	ikonia_	MarcoCeppi	either the drive is dead for DVD's or the media/burn of the dvd is rubbish
2007-02-28T09:39:00.000Z	ikonia_	MarcoCeppi	not really
2007-02-28T09:39:00.000Z	ikonia_	MarcoCeppi	why not burn the edgy cd - rather than dvd
2007-02-28T09:41:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	ikonia_	I'm out of cd-r . I copied the alternative cd to a usb drive and tried doing dist-upgrade by mounting the usb drive as a cd and adding it as a repository. But it always botches the upgrade.
2007-02-28T09:42:00.000Z	ikonia_	MarcoCeppi	you're a bit screwed
2007-02-28T09:42:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	ikonia_	damn, okay I'll go out and buy more cd-r
2007-02-28T09:42:00.000Z	MarcoCeppi	ikonia_	thanks for the time though!
2007-02-28T09:42:00.000Z	ikonia_	MarcoCeppi	sorry
2007-02-28T09:42:00.000Z	ikonia_	MarcoCeppi	any time
