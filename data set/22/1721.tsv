2010-02-05T21:10:00.000Z	mdasilva		whats the best way to check for LVM support from the CLI?
2010-02-05T21:10:00.000Z	mdasilva		in the kernel
2010-02-05T21:10:00.000Z	mdasilva		no point having LVM programs without kernel support i suppose
2010-02-05T21:12:00.000Z	mdasilva		i b0rked a system by going from a juanty to karmic upgrade
2010-02-05T21:13:00.000Z	pingfloyd	mdasilva	the generic image should have lvm support, because I'm use both
2010-02-05T21:14:00.000Z	mdasilva	pingfloyd	cool
2010-02-05T21:14:00.000Z	pingfloyd	mdasilva	also has md-crypt support as well :)
2010-02-05T21:21:00.000Z	pingfloyd	mdasilva	yeah, should definitely be an option without any fuss
2010-02-05T21:22:00.000Z	pingfloyd	mdasilva	I most definitely recommend to use lvm if you want to dm-crypt more than one filesystem
2010-02-05T21:23:00.000Z	pingfloyd	mdasilva	that way you only have to deal with one passphrase instead of multiple ones
2010-02-05T21:23:00.000Z	mdasilva	pingfloyd	not erally looking to dm-crypt but i'll keep it in mind
2010-02-05T21:23:00.000Z	pingfloyd	mdasilva	that's strange
2010-02-05T21:24:00.000Z	pingfloyd	mdasilva	because I've upgraded ok from 9.04 to 9.10 in the past on a system with lvm2 and dmcrypt
2010-02-05T21:24:00.000Z	mdasilva	pingfloyd	i think karmic introduced lvm2... that or the upstart busted things... dunno
2010-02-05T21:24:00.000Z	pingfloyd	mdasilva	9.04 has lvm2
2010-02-05T21:24:00.000Z	pingfloyd	mdasilva	something must've gotten clobbered in the process of your upgrade
2010-02-05T21:25:00.000Z	mdasilva	pingfloyd	 yeah im being optomistic that it is just a lvm issue..
2010-02-05T21:25:00.000Z	pingfloyd	mdasilva	you used the ubuntu packages on the old system right?
2010-02-05T21:25:00.000Z	mdasilva	pingfloyd	yep
2010-02-05T21:25:00.000Z	pingfloyd	mdasilva	for your lvm2
2010-02-05T21:26:00.000Z	pingfloyd	mdasilva	there may be some caveats with lvm1
2010-02-05T21:26:00.000Z	pingfloyd	mdasilva	I was using lvm2 when I upgraded
