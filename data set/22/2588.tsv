Ext4, however, has features.  It's the next version, after all, even if it's a "stopgap" on the way to btrfs.
2011-07-15T09:49:00.000Z	introuble	Darael	rww , ext3 has had longer to prove its stability.  What do you mean by this . and rww i heard there are some features that are not dealt in ext4 . like error checking. dont know. iam new
2011-07-15T09:50:00.000Z	Darael	introuble	Error-checking most certainly is present in ext4.  Ext3, being the version before, has been around for longer and has thus had longer to prove itself stable.
2011-07-15T09:50:00.000Z	Darael	introuble	Ext4 is generally better than ext3 for the majority of purposes.
2011-07-15T09:50:00.000Z	introuble	Darael	rww ok.
2011-07-15T09:51:00.000Z	introuble	Darael	rww thanks !
2011-07-15T09:53:00.000Z	introuble	Darael	rww i just LOVE linux. its just 2 problems. one all and majority of worlds apps are for windows. you can find any and you can find veriety. 2. its gives less command as compared to linux but windows is easy (click click thing). if i have to read and configure linux configs . i get head aches.
2011-07-15T09:54:00.000Z	Darael	introuble	Apps are made for Windows in many cases, it's true.  You might want to think about searching for what you want to do, rather than the program you're used to using to do it.  That, in my experience, tends to get better results.
2011-07-15T09:55:00.000Z	Darael	introuble	As for "click click thing", software installs are definitely easier in the Debian family, such as Ubuntu (because of the repository system) and the only time I've had to mess with config files was when playing with server software that assumes a certain level of willingness to do so.
2011-07-15T09:56:00.000Z	introuble	Darael	no . not just installs. configs. too.
2011-07-15T09:56:00.000Z	Darael	introuble	Hence my /other/ comment, about config files.
2011-07-15T09:58:00.000Z	introuble	Darael	ok.
2011-07-15T09:58:00.000Z	introuble	Darael	i hope it supports ntfs and fat32 . read and writ.
2011-07-15T09:59:00.000Z	introuble	Darael	ubuntu i mean
2011-07-15T09:59:00.000Z	Darael	introuble	It has done for years, without issue.
2011-07-15T09:59:00.000Z	introuble	Darael	ya. last time i used to use kubuntu. it had no ntfs write freature.
2011-07-15T10:00:00.000Z	Darael	introuble	That must have been some time ago; ntfs writeable has been around since at least Hardy, which was three years ago.
2011-07-15T10:01:00.000Z	introuble	Darael	ya. iam a old user. but i had gaps in my linux passion. go into busines. got married. never used computers since then
2011-07-15T10:01:00.000Z	Darael	introuble	Well, good for you for coming back.  You will notice that an awful lot has moved on quite a lot since you last looked.
2011-07-15T10:02:00.000Z	introuble	Darael	ok
2011-07-15T10:03:00.000Z	Darael	introuble	You can place overrides in an xorg.conf that you create, but most of the config gets autogenerated on the fly for X these days.
2011-07-15T10:04:00.000Z	introuble	Darael	hm. ic. so what is the xorg.conf replaced by?/
