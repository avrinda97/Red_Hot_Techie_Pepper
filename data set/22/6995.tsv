2008-11-01T14:45:00.000Z	domas	jrib	stops at a*
2008-11-01T14:26:00.000Z	domas	jrib	debug symbols are not only for debugging, they're for profiling too
2008-11-01T14:26:00.000Z	jrib	domas	idc what they are for... that page tells you where packages with debug symbols are...
2008-11-01T14:28:00.000Z	domas	jrib	you must have very keen eyes - because I don't see where it mentions how to find debug packages that don't exist
2008-11-01T14:28:00.000Z	jrib	domas	click on the first few links and read a little.  They are there.  You may need to update information for intrepid by changing "hardy" to "intrepid"
2008-11-01T14:29:00.000Z	domas	jrib	we're running hardy :)
2008-11-01T14:29:00.000Z	jrib	domas	even easier then :)
2008-11-01T14:30:00.000Z	domas	jrib	hah, ddebs, right
2008-11-01T14:31:00.000Z	domas	jrib	the link was mislabeled, I mostly need symbols for oprofile, not for 'debugging crashing programs' ;-)
2008-11-01T14:37:00.000Z	jrib	domas	pastebin your current sources.list
2008-11-01T14:38:00.000Z	jrib	domas	get rid of the hardy-proposed ddebs
2008-11-01T14:38:00.000Z	domas	jrib	same failure
2008-11-01T14:39:00.000Z	jrib	domas	pastebin: apt-cache policy php5-cgi-dbgsym php5-cgi
2008-11-01T14:39:00.000Z	domas	jrib	http://p.defau.lt/?krMxZWXtky__KwgxNNuzyQ ;-)
2008-11-01T14:39:00.000Z	domas	jrib	I see you have decent amount of nice people, that you use 'pastebin' as a verb. I even run my own pastebin service! :)
2008-11-01T14:41:00.000Z	domas	jrib	strange though, Packages was modified 30-Oct-2008
2008-11-01T14:41:00.000Z	domas	jrib	so it is not like ddebs is 'lagging'
2008-11-01T14:44:00.000Z	jrib	domas	I don't know why those are out of date.  I guess you can build your own (it's on the wiki page) and file a bug
2008-11-01T14:45:00.000Z	domas	jrib	ah, it is truncated: http://ddebs.ubuntu.com/dists/hardy-security/main/binary-amd64/Packages
2008-11-01T14:45:00.000Z	jrib	domas	good catch
2008-11-01T14:46:00.000Z	domas	jrib	I'll just open a case with canonical I guess
2008-11-01T14:53:00.000Z	domas	jrib	interesting, http://ddebs.ubuntu.com/pool/main/p/php5/ doesn't have the packages either, so it seems to be broken hardy ddebs process, argh.
