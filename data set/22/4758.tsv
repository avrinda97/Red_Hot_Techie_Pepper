2007-11-02T01:47:00.000Z	Sitting_Duck		I have a SATA DVD drive that Ubuntu can read data from but can't play movies from. I've installed all of the necessary codecs, but still can't play video. I've tried VLC, Mplayer, Totem, and Movie Player. What am I missing?
2007-11-02T01:48:00.000Z	stefg	Sitting_Duck	what is your DVD drives device name ?
2007-11-02T01:48:00.000Z	Sitting_Duck	stefg	scd0
2007-11-02T01:49:00.000Z	stefg	Sitting_Duck	try setting that in vlc settings. usually all the DVD player jump through some symlink /dev/dvd , which might be simply wrong in your case
2007-11-02T01:50:00.000Z	Sitting_Duck	stefg	I've checked the VLC settings -- that's actually where I originally got the device name
2007-11-02T01:51:00.000Z	stefg	Sitting_Duck	check dmesg if that's really the device name... could be sr0 or something more exotic
2007-11-02T01:52:00.000Z	Sitting_Duck	stefg	How do I go about using dmesg?
2007-11-02T01:52:00.000Z	stefg	Sitting_Duck	just open a terminal and run 'dmesg | most'
2007-11-02T01:52:00.000Z	stefg	Sitting_Duck	just open a terminal and run 'dmesg |  less' , rather
2007-11-02T01:53:00.000Z	Sitting_Duck	stefg	yeah, I'm looking at it now
2007-11-02T01:53:00.000Z	stefg	Sitting_Duck	so skim over it and try to figure out what the kernel thinks about your drive
2007-11-02T01:54:00.000Z	Sitting_Duck	stefg	Any idea whether there's something specific I should look for? "DVD", for instance?
2007-11-02T01:55:00.000Z	stefg	Sitting_Duck	that differs from machine to machine.. you could !pastebin it if you want me to have a look
2007-11-02T01:55:00.000Z	stefg		!paste | Sitting_Duck
2007-11-02T01:55:00.000Z	Sitting_Duck	stefg	Yeah, I've used it. I'll do that.
2007-11-02T01:56:00.000Z	Sitting_Duck	stefg	Actually, I just noticed that the last huge chunk of the file is nothing but lines like: [444555.243746] end_request: I/O error, dev sr0, sector 4251180
2007-11-02T01:57:00.000Z	stefg	Sitting_Duck	oh, that's something ... you have libdvdcss, haven't you ?
2007-11-02T01:57:00.000Z	Sitting_Duck		I do
2007-11-02T01:57:00.000Z	Sitting_Duck	stefg	I do, yeah
2007-11-02T01:58:00.000Z	Sitting_Duck	stefg	At least, I've installed libdvdcss2 a couple of times. Also, the ubuntu restricted drivers.
2007-11-02T01:58:00.000Z	stefg	Sitting_Duck	could it ba that just the DVD medium is bad ?
2007-11-02T01:59:00.000Z	Sitting_Duck	stefg	I doubt it -- it's a borrowed DVD that my friend just bought. He watched it yesterday, if I'm not mistaken.
