2008-06-06T23:16:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis		Stooj: Ok. Which option do I select to use the CD as a live CD?
2008-06-06T23:17:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis		ahhh
2008-06-06T23:17:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis		hmm
2008-06-06T23:18:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis		stooj: I don't have that, I have Install Ubuntu Server, Check CD for defects, rescue a broken system, test memory, and boot from first hard disk
2008-06-06T23:18:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis		ok so I need to download something else
2008-06-06T23:18:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis		like knoppix?
2008-06-06T23:19:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis		Stooj:  So I can use the desktop edition installation CD as a live CD for my server?
2008-06-06T23:21:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis		Stooj:  What I need to do is to copy my entire current server configuration to an external USB hard drive that I have mounted so that I can set up a RAID 1 on my server, then copy my configuration back from the HD to the server
2008-06-06T23:22:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis		stooj: ok thank you, I will check it out - I was trying to use dd
2008-06-06T23:24:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis		I was following a tutorial on using DD and it said I needed to boot from a live CD in order to copy over my main file system into a gz file

2008-07-15T23:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RomanaMentalis	hda = first drive, hdb is second etc..   sdc1 would be hd2,0
2008-07-15T23:05:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis	Jack_Sparrow	 thank you
2008-07-15T23:06:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis	Jack_Sparrow	 When I try to install Grub on (hd2, 0) I get a fatal error
2008-07-15T23:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RomanaMentalis	do you have three drives?
2008-07-15T23:07:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis	Jack_Sparrow	 I have 4 hard drives, 2 of them are combined into one virtual disk (Raid1) and the other 2 are nothing yet, I installed Ubuntu on the virtual disk (sdc1)
2008-07-15T23:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RomanaMentalis	That wont work for raid...
2008-07-16T06:11:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis	Jack_Sparrow	- those raid links are broken
2008-07-16T06:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RomanaMentalis	I will check into them later

2008-12-03T04:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RomanaMentalis	/j #ubuntu-server
2008-12-03T05:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RomanaMentalis	dd if=/dev/sda | gzip > /mnt/sdb1/system_drive_backup.img.gz           as example of regular dd command
