2008-08-04T23:12:00.000Z	hyw	bazhang	and this http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/Hardware/Installing_Skystar_2_in_Linux
2008-08-04T23:12:00.000Z	hyw	bazhang	also this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=683661
2008-08-04T23:12:00.000Z	bazhang	hyw	seems that some others do in fact support it; checking on ubuntu now
2008-08-04T23:13:00.000Z	hyw	bazhang	its the most popular tv pci card in the world
2008-08-04T23:14:00.000Z	bazhang	hyw	which version? 2.7 or other
2008-08-04T23:16:00.000Z	hyw	bazhang	I wonder where those guys got theh 2.7 version from as it just says skystar2 pci tv
2008-08-04T23:17:00.000Z	hyw	bazhang	SDK 1.13 (10/2007) thats all the info I can get from their website
2008-08-04T23:20:00.000Z	hyw	bazhang	someone said in ubuntu forums that all i have to do is sudo modprobe b2c2-flexcop-pci and sudo modprobe stv0299 and useKaffeine to play it.. but no replies  in the terminal after i typed those commands
2008-08-04T23:21:00.000Z	bazhang	hyw	that is for 2.6; 2.7 is another matter from what the forums say
2008-08-04T23:21:00.000Z	hyw	bazhang	I wonder what 2.6 or 2.7 stand for as there is only 1 product which is called skystar2 pci tv
2008-08-04T23:22:00.000Z	bazhang	hyw	two different chipsets apparently; the second you have to compile the drivers for
2008-08-04T23:23:00.000Z	hyw	bazhang	hmm probably because one is chinese or from taiwan and the other one is german
2008-08-04T23:44:00.000Z	hyw	bazhang	any luck
2012-10-26T20:58:00.000Z	bazhang	hyw	empathy should be able to handle qq
