2006-04-06T14:38:00.000Z	IamEthos		how many primary partitions can fit on a single disk?
2006-04-06T14:38:00.000Z	IamEthos		120 GB
2006-04-06T14:39:00.000Z	IamEthos		and what are the drawbacks of Fat32?
2006-04-06T14:39:00.000Z	IamEthos		Not for booting, for storing data
2006-04-06T14:39:00.000Z	ben42	IamEthos	only 4 are allowed
2006-04-06T14:40:00.000Z	IamEthos		is there a problem with using a Fat32 drive for storing data?
2006-04-06T14:40:00.000Z	IamEthos		no operating system is on this
2006-04-06T14:41:00.000Z	IamEthos		I just want access between MS and Linux for the data
2006-04-06T14:41:00.000Z	IamEthos		not robust:
2006-04-06T14:41:00.000Z	IamEthos		what does that mean?
2006-04-06T14:42:00.000Z	IamEthos	squiddle	someone suggested to me that Fat32 would be better because third party filesystem drivers can be shady and dangerous
2006-04-06T14:42:00.000Z	IamEthos		you can understand that i'd be far more comfortable with a MS branded driver
2006-04-06T14:42:00.000Z	IamEthos		really?
2006-04-06T14:42:00.000Z	IamEthos		I didn't know that
2006-04-06T14:43:00.000Z	IamEthos		lol
2006-04-06T14:43:00.000Z	IamEthos		you make a good point
2006-04-06T14:43:00.000Z	IamEthos		and I'd like to get rid of Windows, but there are a few applications I'm not ready to abandon just yet
2006-04-06T14:43:00.000Z	IamEthos		I was wondering, why hasn't anyone made an advanced linux/windows hybrid OS
2006-04-06T14:43:00.000Z	ben42	IamEthos	i know someone who stored over 70 gb data on fat32 (created with linux) and as then windowsdriver writes once more on it, it writes not at the end but at the beginnig of the partition and he lost some data
2006-04-06T14:44:00.000Z	IamEthos		really
2006-04-06T14:44:00.000Z	IamEthos		hmm
2006-04-06T14:44:00.000Z	ben42	IamEthos	that is only one example for "not robust"
