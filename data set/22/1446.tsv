2010-05-13T13:43:00.000Z	Dablfox		i re-installed nautilus but it didn't fix it! are you all using nautilus by default??
2010-05-13T13:44:00.000Z	kjele	Dablfox	What is the problem?
2010-05-13T13:44:00.000Z	Dablfox	kjele	when i scroll up it all gets messy :(
2010-05-13T13:45:00.000Z	kjele	Dablfox	But you can scroll down?
2010-05-13T13:46:00.000Z	Dablfox	kjele	when i first begin with scrollin down everything is ok, but when i need to scroll up it all gets messy even if i scroll down again!!
2010-05-13T13:47:00.000Z	kjele	Dablfox	Have you tried adding a new user and see if that new user has the same problem?
2010-05-13T13:47:00.000Z	Dablfox	kjele	do you thing i have to stop using nautilus? choose something else? nope i didnt do with a new user!
2010-05-13T13:48:00.000Z	kjele	Dablfox	Just to rule out that you do not have any config files that is messing up
2010-05-13T13:49:00.000Z	Dablfox	kjele	yup , that's possible . u right. are u using nautilus u yourself??
2010-05-13T13:50:00.000Z	kjele	Dablfox	Can you also take of screen shot when it happens? Every gnome user use nautilus by default so yes
2010-05-13T13:50:00.000Z	Dablfox	kjele	do you mean you want a screenshot of it?
2010-05-13T13:51:00.000Z	kjele	Dablfox	yes.
2010-05-13T13:52:00.000Z	Dablfox	kjele	ok. give me a sec!

2010-05-13T14:09:00.000Z	Dablfox	kjele	my trouble when i scroll up! ---->http://imagebin.org/96670     :((
2010-05-13T14:09:00.000Z	Dablfox	kjele	same pb when i scrool down again --->  http://imagebin.org/96671
2010-05-13T14:16:00.000Z	kjele	Dablfox	I though so it is a know bug. The thing to fix this is to disable preview (tumbnail) on the images
2010-05-13T14:16:00.000Z	Dablfox	kjele	really?! owkay
2010-05-13T14:17:00.000Z	kjele	Dablfox	Well you can wait for the images to finish displaying
2010-05-13T14:17:00.000Z	kjele	Dablfox	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/401840
2010-05-13T14:18:00.000Z	Dablfox	kjele	no its not a matter of time i think , the images still the same; the only thing i have to do when it's like that is to refresh or change tab
2010-05-13T14:18:00.000Z	Dablfox	kjele	thanx for the link.
