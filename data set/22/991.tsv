2011-01-19T16:37:00.000Z	sam-_-	Emery	are you sure it isn't blacklisted?
2011-01-19T16:37:00.000Z	Emery	sam-_-	i blacklisted 2800usb and sta
2011-01-19T16:37:00.000Z	sam-_-	Emery	why?
2011-01-19T16:38:00.000Z	sam-_-	Emery	i can't find 2800sta

2011-01-19T16:40:00.000Z	sam-_-	Emery	i don't understand why you can't insert the module via modprobe. look into dmesg. maybe it will tell you sth. useful
2011-01-19T16:42:00.000Z	sam-_-	Emery	well there you go. that's the problem
2011-01-19T16:42:00.000Z	Emery	sam-_-	yes the modules not found but the drivers wont compile under ubuntu 8.10
2011-01-19T16:43:00.000Z	sam-_-	Emery	8.10 isn't supported anymore.
2011-01-19T16:45:00.000Z	sam-_-	Emery	i won't help you anymore sry.
