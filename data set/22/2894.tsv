2009-02-22T20:23:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	-- ifconfig up and ifup are not the same thing!
2009-02-22T20:24:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	- ifup = ifdown -- how do you know what state the adapter is in?
2009-02-22T20:25:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	- What -- b43 driver not bcm43xx
2009-02-22T20:26:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	-- Im not arguing -- what is line 3?
2009-02-22T20:27:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	--product: BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN - line 3?
2009-02-22T20:28:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	-- Where you getting bcm43xx?
2009-02-22T20:30:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	What are you getting at?  I'm running 4306
2009-02-22T20:31:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	bcm43xx were the old drivers, b43 are the new drivers
2009-02-22T20:33:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	That is my point, was using b43 drivers -- and not the bcm43xx drivers.  bcm43xx drivers were for old kernel versions
2009-02-22T20:35:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	-- see your around
2009-02-22T20:35:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	-- yes -- was shot dead or something crazy like that
2009-02-22T20:37:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	-- That is what it reports however I actually using b43 -- with the opensource openfwwf firmware.
2009-02-22T20:39:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	Here are the instructions I followed: http://linuxfans.betaserver.org/
2009-02-22T20:39:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	And yes I guess I did some compiling you could say:)
2009-02-22T20:53:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	Here is a pretty good up-to-date list on what chipset and what drivers -- Please note that the old bcm43xx driver (the one everyone used to use) is dead!
2009-02-22T20:54:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	Here is the list: http://linuxfans.betaserver.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=46:broadcom-guide-for-ubuntu-hardy-and-newer&catid=34:guides&Itemid=61
2009-02-22T20:55:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	You'll be surprised with b43 on the newer kernel -- full 54mbs support
2009-02-22T20:56:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	Never used the STA driver !!!  But at least you can dump the unreliable bcm43xx -- and ndiswrapper -- had its day but now its done!
2009-02-22T20:58:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	-- The jaunty kernel will be even better since you wil be able to use channels 12.13,14 with a workaround :)
2009-02-22T20:59:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	Dont tell anyone!
2009-02-22T21:00:00.000Z	KevDog	n8tuser	And of course I was referring to use in Japan BTW :p
