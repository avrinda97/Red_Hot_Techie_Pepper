2010-11-05T20:51:00.000Z	cfedde		echo ls | at now # should work.
2010-11-05T20:52:00.000Z	kamsky	cfedde	the problem is that it doesnt work, if instead ls i write... touch proof, it creates the file
2010-11-05T20:52:00.000Z	cfedde	kamsky	what do you expect it to do?
2010-11-05T20:53:00.000Z	kamsky	cfedde	see output of ls
2010-11-05T20:53:00.000Z	cfedde	kamsky	it sends the results as email
2010-11-05T20:53:00.000Z	kamsky	cfedde	email?¿? i want it on screen
2010-11-05T20:55:00.000Z	kamsky	cfedde	some idea?¿
2010-11-05T20:57:00.000Z	cfedde	kamsky	echo 'ls > /tmp/ls' | at now
2010-11-05T20:58:00.000Z	kamsky	cfedde	but it creates a file, i want to see on the terminal
2010-11-05T20:58:00.000Z	cfedde	kamsky	the issue is that a command run that way does not have access to the terminal
2010-11-05T20:58:00.000Z	kamsky	cfedde	ok, and if for example i try: echo wireshark | at now
2010-11-05T20:58:00.000Z	kamsky	cfedde	it doesnt start
2010-11-05T20:59:00.000Z	cfedde	kamsky	because there is no terminal associated with the session started by at
2010-11-05T20:59:00.000Z	kamsky	cfedde	can i fix this?
2010-11-05T20:59:00.000Z	kamsky	cfedde	maybe exporting display var?
2010-11-05T20:59:00.000Z	cfedde	kamsky	I'm not sure what there is to fix.
2010-11-05T21:00:00.000Z	kamsky	cfedde	i want that in 20 minutes start watching a film...
2010-11-05T21:01:00.000Z	cfedde	kamsky	sleep 1200; vlc.....
2010-11-05T21:01:00.000Z	kamsky	cfedde	but i want to program it with at..
2010-11-05T21:02:00.000Z	cfedde	kamsky	I suspect there is a way to make the session started by at find the right display.  But in general it has no way to know if you're even still logged in when it starts.
2010-11-05T21:02:00.000Z	kamsky	cfedde	ok, thanks
2010-11-05T21:05:00.000Z	kamsky	cfedde	this works: echo export DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \&\& wireshark | at now
