2005-01-28T07:54:00.000Z	knghtbrd		GergKH
2005-01-28T07:54:00.000Z	knghtbrd		2.6.10 + USB == bad!
2005-01-28T07:55:00.000Z	mebaran	knghtbrd	how so
2005-01-28T07:55:00.000Z	knghtbrd	mebaran	I think it has to do with some patch that was reverted ISTR around 2.6.7 and then put back
2005-01-28T07:56:00.000Z	knghtbrd	mebaran	I'll have to find Zeph Hull to get him to explain it to me.  I haven't had a working system before ... Yesterday.
2005-01-28T07:56:00.000Z	mebaran		you can
2005-01-28T07:57:00.000Z	mebaran	knghtbrd	so USB just sort of failed
2005-01-28T07:57:00.000Z	knghtbrd	mebaran	well, using it I get no keyboard and mouse (even though they exist), and when switching my input devices to PS/2 they work, but I can't use my Palms
2005-01-28T07:57:00.000Z	knghtbrd	mebaran	so basically yes  =D
2005-01-28T07:57:00.000Z	mebaran		oh
2005-01-28T07:58:00.000Z	mebaran	knghtbrd	did you make sure to load usb-hid
2005-01-28T07:58:00.000Z	mebaran		had the same problem on yoper
2005-01-28T07:58:00.000Z	mebaran		for my mouse as I always use a USB keyboard
2005-01-28T07:58:00.000Z	knghtbrd	mebaran	It loads itself on Ubuntu if needed
2005-01-28T07:58:00.000Z	mebaran		well sometimes my autodetection was weird
2005-01-28T07:58:00.000Z	mebaran		Ubuntu was the first system to actually succeed
2005-01-28T07:58:00.000Z	mebaran		at finding all my toys
2005-01-28T07:59:00.000Z	knghtbrd		I don't think it's autodetection on Ubuntu.  I bet they cram the HID module in if they see USB ports.  It's the safe solution
2005-01-28T07:59:00.000Z	mebaran		maybe
2005-01-28T07:59:00.000Z	mebaran		not my area of expertise
2005-01-28T08:01:00.000Z	knghtbrd	mebaran	no longer mine either.  Two years ago I could have built a distribution from scratch.  I did, more than once, one even had a 32 machine userbase(!), but I left the platform for awhile and the world has changed.
