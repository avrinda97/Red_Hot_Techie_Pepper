2009-07-23T09:44:00.000Z	stea		i typed iwconfig and see no wireless extensions
2009-07-23T09:45:00.000Z	stea		i typed lscpci and i see my atheros 802.11abg wireless adapter on the list. mazda01 : no i just did a brand new installation of hardy LTS desktop
2009-07-23T09:46:00.000Z	stea		and mazda01 : those are two commands i just found from google but they didnt help
2009-07-23T09:47:00.000Z	stea		mazda01 : ethernet hard cable works . i unplugged it.
2009-07-23T09:47:00.000Z	stea		mazda01 but i dont know how to bring up the wireless interface
2009-07-23T09:49:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	have you gone in to system, admin, networking to activate your wireless card? what does lspci -v return for wireless cards?
2009-07-23T09:56:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	if you;re sure you have an atheros card then it should work. what does this return.  lsmod | grep ath
2009-07-23T09:57:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	we need to first find out if your card has the correct modules loaded for it. what does the exact lspci -v return for the wireless card?
2009-07-23T10:02:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	ok, one second. let me gogle it.
2009-07-23T10:03:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	what is the model number of the d-link? is it a DWA-645?
2009-07-23T10:05:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	bad news, it works but only at 11mbps. here's a guide: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=668272   just follow it. it says you can use ndiswrapper or native madwifi driver but have to compile from source. give it a shot.
2009-07-23T10:07:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	apparently not. did you run that command I asked you to run?  lsmod | grep ath_pci
2009-07-23T10:10:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	ok. type modprobe ath_pci and tell me what happens. you might need to run it with sudo in front
2009-07-23T10:17:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	you still around?
2009-07-23T10:18:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	did you run the modprobe command?
2009-07-23T10:19:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	not neccesarily. now enter lsmod | grep ath_pci
2009-07-23T10:23:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	so you ran the modprobe ath_pci and it returned nothing? then you ran lsmod | grep ath_pci and that didn't return anything either? what about this command: lshw -C network
2009-07-23T10:27:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	what does ifconfig return?
2009-07-23T10:27:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	ok but if you're going to upgrade, just go all the way to jaunty while you're at it as they fixed many issues with pulseaudio and I am sure the wireless support only gets better.
2009-07-23T10:29:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	i already gave you the link for using that wifi card and ubuntu. it deals with compiling madwifi drivers from scratch or using ndiswrapper.
2009-07-23T10:31:00.000Z	mazda01__	stea	you shouldn't be scared at compiling from source. it's part of linux sometimes. this would be a perfect to dive in. just follow it step by step and i am sure it'll work out for you. i remember the first time I compiled from source. I was so scard and it turned out to be so easy.
