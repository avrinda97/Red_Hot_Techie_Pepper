2010-12-22T18:15:00.000Z	rigved	Guest64773	just curious, what did you change (install/remove) just before you started getting this error?

2010-12-22T18:17:00.000Z	Guest64773	rigved	i upgraded from ubuntu 10.04 to 10.10
2010-12-22T18:20:00.000Z	rigved	Guest64773	like sacarlson said, can you boot into a different kernel version?
2010-12-22T18:21:00.000Z	Guest64773	rigved	i have  tried that but still not working
2010-12-22T18:21:00.000Z	rigved	Guest64773	have you tried the recovery mode (though not sure that this will work either)...
2010-12-22T18:22:00.000Z	Guest64773	rigved	my mouse and networking wouldn't work
2010-12-22T18:23:00.000Z	rigved	Guest64773	yes but can you login in recovery mode?
2010-12-22T18:24:00.000Z	Guest64773	rigved	yes i can
2010-12-22T18:32:00.000Z	rigved	Guest64773	your kernel wasn't installed properly. specifically, your kernel modules were either not compiled or they have not been set in the modules.
2010-12-22T18:33:00.000Z	Guest64773	rigved	please how do i fix this?
2010-12-22T18:34:00.000Z	rigved	Guest64773	this is not exactly a solution. i suggest that you make a backup of your /home folder and /var/cache/apt/archive folder. then you must reinstall ubuntu 10.10. make sure you create a seperate /home partition
2010-12-22T18:37:00.000Z	Guest64773	rigved	WOW. Please is there anyother way i can fix this without reinstalling.. because i do not want to lose any files and configuration
2010-12-22T18:39:00.000Z	rigved	Guest64773	the other way is this - http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/compiling-linux-kernel-module.html
2010-12-22T18:40:00.000Z	rigved	Guest64773	or what Dr_Willis said
