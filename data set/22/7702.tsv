2007-05-04T09:50:00.000Z	majd		damn..i cant find any good tutorials on installing subversion...it can't be as easy as apt-get install subversion...
2007-05-04T09:50:00.000Z	majd		oh..on dapper
2007-05-04T09:50:00.000Z	majd		how would it know where my code is?
2007-05-04T09:51:00.000Z	sethk	majd	similar to CVS.  CVS uses an environment variable, CVSROOT
2007-05-04T09:51:00.000Z	majd	sethk	i've never used either =\
2007-05-04T09:52:00.000Z	sethk	majd	ok.  most subversion users are using it partly because, if you know how to use CVS, you know how to use subversion also.
2007-05-04T09:52:00.000Z	sethk	majd	the answer to your question is that there is a root repository directory, and then specific projects have a name, called I believe a module name in the docs.
2007-05-04T09:53:00.000Z	sethk	majd	then it's installed.  Check out a howto about CVS.
2007-05-04T09:53:00.000Z	majd	sethk	ok, but i'm already working on a project, is it possible to just change the root svn directory to that?
2007-05-04T09:53:00.000Z	sethk	majd	yes, you can set the environment variable to point anywhere you like.
2007-05-04T09:56:00.000Z	sethk	majd	you want to look at RCS then
2007-05-04T09:56:00.000Z	sethk	majd	you only need something like CVS or subversion for a project with multiple developers
2007-05-04T09:56:00.000Z	majd	sethk	i see
2007-05-04T09:56:00.000Z	sethk	majd	RCS is the source code control system underlying CVS.
2007-05-04T09:56:00.000Z	sethk	majd	it has check in, check out, you can check out an old version, roll back, what you want to do.
2007-05-04T09:57:00.000Z	majd	sethk	ok perfect...and if i have other devs working on the same project, then i'd need subversion?
2007-05-04T09:57:00.000Z	sethk	majd	it's really quite easy.  after you install, the check in program is "ci" and the check out program is "co".
2007-05-04T09:57:00.000Z	sethk	majd	yes.  cvs or subversion adds things like merging multiple changes, updating your code to reflect other people's changes, etc.
2007-05-04T09:58:00.000Z	majd	sethk	oh wow...that's pretty intense
2007-05-04T09:58:00.000Z	sethk	majd	don't worry about it to start with.  :)
2007-05-04T09:58:00.000Z	sethk	majd	bzr is a newer alternative to RCS that I've heard some good things about
2007-05-04T09:59:00.000Z	majd	sethk	mneptok, i just remembered, i was referred to bazaar a while ago, but i never thought much of it...thanks a lot..i'll setup it up now (looks like they have good docs)
