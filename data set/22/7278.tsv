2006-05-05T05:02:00.000Z	Steff_breezy		Hi, I have a massive problem: when I open my home folder with nautilus, the window opens, but the files/folders in it are not to be seen, just an empty space in the window. You have to kill this window to close it. After a few minutes, I have an intense disk activity and have to restart X, cause it hangs then. Reboot didnt help. Other nautilus windows react normally. Please help
2006-05-05T05:02:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	what the hell you got in there?
2006-05-05T05:02:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	can you do an ls in a terminal?
2006-05-05T05:02:00.000Z	Steff_breezy	bakert	nothing special..
2006-05-05T05:02:00.000Z	Steff_breezy	bakert	yes
2006-05-05T05:02:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	how many files?
2006-05-05T05:03:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	ls -la | wc -l
2006-05-05T05:03:00.000Z	Steff_breezy	bakert	99 files
2006-05-05T05:04:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	hmm ... are any of them images?  that is not a terrible thought from Ali .. could be something to do with trying to generate a thumbnail?
2006-05-05T05:04:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	mind you it does thumbnails for lots of things
2006-05-05T05:04:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	like pdfs, etc.  Perhaps you can get into list view first then go there and see if it is better behaved?
2006-05-05T05:05:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	oh no that doesnt work, views are per folder ... it might be a setting?
2006-05-05T05:05:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	yes - Edit, Preferences and its there
2006-05-05T05:05:00.000Z	Steff_breezy	bakert	theres no image or media file in it
2006-05-05T05:06:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	i would try changing pref to list view and see if it helps ... just to eliminate the possibility
2006-05-05T05:06:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	and because i dont have any better ideas!
2006-05-05T05:06:00.000Z	Steff_breezy	bakert	ok, Ill try
2006-05-05T05:08:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	hmm ... ok so now it is a question of what is the culprit.
2006-05-05T05:08:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	you could try moving half the files somewhere else and keep doing half again and find the culprit(s) by process of elimination?
2006-05-05T05:09:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	or it could be that there is something wrong with thumbnail generation on your machine, period
2006-05-05T05:09:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	or perhaps this is enough of a fix?
2006-05-05T05:14:00.000Z	bakert	Steff_breezy	so it is something other than thumbnails about icon view??  Odd.
