2010-06-24T14:23:00.000Z	AAA	ddilinger	 d0h!
2010-06-24T14:24:00.000Z	AAA	ddilinger	 better than curl?
2010-06-24T14:24:00.000Z	ddilinger	AAA	by far, aria2c does parallel downloads
2010-06-24T14:24:00.000Z	ddilinger	AAA	either from same server, or multiple servers
2010-06-24T14:24:00.000Z	AAA	ddilinger	 hot
2010-06-24T14:25:00.000Z	ddilinger	AAA	you could point it at 10 mirrors for the same kernel source, and it will download from all of them in parallel, i can often get 4x the speed with aria2c (my net maxes as 2MB/sec though, if u have a slow connection might not be so noticable)
2010-06-24T14:26:00.000Z	AAA	ddilinger	 so it handles files similar to a torrent then?
2010-06-24T14:26:00.000Z	ddilinger	AAA	kinda, it also does torrents :)  and ftp, http, metalink, prob a few more
2010-06-24T14:45:00.000Z	ddilinger	AAA	his system wont boot
2010-06-24T14:51:00.000Z	AAA	ddilinger	 like grub isn't installed proper?
2010-06-24T14:51:00.000Z	ddilinger	AAA	not sure, i havn't been able to determine what actually is wrong, besides that his system will only boot from the live cd
2010-06-24T15:06:00.000Z	ddilinger	AAA	use konsole :P  zoom in/out mapped to ctrl + and ctrl -
2010-06-24T15:38:00.000Z	AAA	ddilinger	 yeah... in 1999 ;)
2010-06-24T15:38:00.000Z	ddilinger	AAA	you caught me, i been on freenode since before 1999 :P
2010-06-24T16:02:00.000Z	AAA	ddilinger	 but the entropy will be lost
2010-06-24T16:02:00.000Z	ddilinger	AAA	hmm, really?  i didn't think the file itself made any difference it just hooked into the kernel
2010-06-24T16:04:00.000Z	AAA	ddilinger	 I am not clear on the full specs. but whst I do know is /dev/?random is what creates entropy
2010-06-24T16:04:00.000Z	AAA	ddilinger	 or stores it or something. I dunno....
2010-06-24T16:38:00.000Z	ddilinger	AAA	dunno, thought i saw him mentioned something about that near the begining
2010-06-24T16:39:00.000Z	ddilinger	AAA	although it was listed under the non-prefered fix methods
2010-06-24T16:39:00.000Z	AAA	ddilinger	 ;)
2010-06-24T16:41:00.000Z	AAA	ddilinger	 I suggested that fix to a friend recently and just got a a quisicle stare
