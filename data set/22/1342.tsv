2011-01-10T01:27:00.000Z	Kruptein	maco	thanks
2011-01-10T01:29:00.000Z	Kruptein	maco	do you need to run an update command or such after that?
2011-01-10T01:29:00.000Z	maco	Kruptein	yes. sudo apt-get update
2011-01-10T01:30:00.000Z	Kruptein	maco	that gives me a bunch of errors
2011-01-10T01:31:00.000Z	maco	Kruptein	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
2011-01-10T01:31:00.000Z	maco	Kruptein	does it look like all the urls have been chagned to us.archive.ubuntu.com?
2011-01-10T01:31:00.000Z	Kruptein	maco	yes
2011-01-10T01:32:00.000Z	maco	Kruptein	so what kind of errors?
2011-01-10T01:32:00.000Z	Kruptein	maco	it says it can't reach ppa.launchapd.net   however I couldn't find any "ppa" in my sources.list
2011-01-10T01:34:00.000Z	maco	Kruptein	how about /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* ?
2011-01-10T01:35:00.000Z	maco	Kruptein	when you use add-apt-repository command it puts them in separate files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ so you can delete a file to remove it
2011-01-10T01:35:00.000Z	maco	Kruptein	ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
2011-01-10T01:35:00.000Z	Kruptein	maco	so I would "delete" (backup) all those files?
2011-01-10T01:38:00.000Z	maco	Kruptein	unlock your network?
2011-01-10T01:38:00.000Z	maco	Kruptein	you mean use a wep key?
2011-01-10T01:39:00.000Z	Kruptein	maco	yes indeed
2011-01-10T01:40:00.000Z	maco	Kruptein	sudo iwconfig iface essid linksys key foobar   --- replace iface with yoru wireless interface's name (can see it if you just type "iwconfig"), replace linksys with your ssid, and replace foobar with the wep key
2011-01-10T01:41:00.000Z	Kruptein	maco	as essid I get off/any, can I just drop the arg?
