2005-02-09T12:26:00.000Z	Peter		im running a 32bit dchroot in 64bit ubuntu - but the 32bit environment doesnt appear to have xorg installed, how would i install/configure it?
2005-02-09T12:28:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	You shouldn't need to install xorg in the chroot -- you can use the X server from the 64-bit side.
2005-02-09T12:28:00.000Z	Peter	darksatanic	when i type 'X -version' in the chroot, it says command not founbd
2005-02-09T12:29:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	That's right. What are you trying to do? Get a 32-bit app running in X?
2005-02-09T12:29:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	OK.
2005-02-09T12:29:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	Use chroot to get a shell in the 32-bit environment,
2005-02-09T12:29:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	Then "export DISPLAY=:0.0"
2005-02-09T12:30:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	Then run your app from the same shell.
2005-02-09T12:30:00.000Z	Peter	darksatanic	it still isnt giving hardware acceleration
2005-02-09T12:31:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	Neurgh. Umm. I haven't looked into that yet.
2005-02-09T12:33:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	I _think_ the extension has the same name in both, but I could be wrong.
2005-02-09T12:34:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	You can tell if you have hw acceleration from "glxinfo"
2005-02-09T12:54:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	What hardware?
2005-02-09T12:54:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	CPU?
2005-02-09T12:55:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	What does glxinfo say?
2005-02-09T13:05:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	Yes, I believe that it should.
2005-02-09T13:15:00.000Z	Peter	darksatanic	it appears it hasnt. any idea on how to install it?
2005-02-09T13:15:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	Not really, no. Sorry. :(
2005-02-09T13:15:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	See my exchange with Poof a few lines back...
2005-02-10T09:24:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	Actaully, that's not entirely true. The IDE/SCSI layer for optical drives is deprecated with 2.6 kernels.
2005-02-10T09:26:00.000Z	darksatanic	Peter	The fstab line you pasted a couple of minutes ago is fine for a CD/DVD writer.
2005-02-10T09:34:00.000Z	Peter	darksatanic	ok, it seems to see it now. weird.
