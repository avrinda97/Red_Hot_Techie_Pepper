2007-01-26T12:21:00.000Z	joeamined		i've got a bizzare problem
2007-01-26T12:22:00.000Z	mustaukko	joeamined	where's trouble? :)
2007-01-26T12:22:00.000Z	joeamined		html files are sometimes opened with the web browser and other times by bluefish (the web editor). how can i fix this ?
2007-01-26T12:23:00.000Z	mustaukko	joeamined	whoa.. lets check
2007-01-26T12:24:00.000Z	joeamined	mustaukko	: u can help me ?
2007-01-26T12:24:00.000Z	mustaukko	joeamined	could it be that some of them are called HTML files?
2007-01-26T12:24:00.000Z	mustaukko	joeamined	and some html files?
2007-01-26T12:24:00.000Z	mustaukko	joeamined	or even htm files?
2007-01-26T12:25:00.000Z	joeamined		well a html file is opened in the webbrowser but, for example when i use kopete to open my inbox in my hotmail account, it uses bluefish to open it.
2007-01-26T12:26:00.000Z	mustaukko	joeamined	it's got something to do with default programs. And might well be that kopete uses different set than rest of your programs.
2007-01-26T12:26:00.000Z	joeamined		maybe it's because kopete is for kde and i didn't define the default application to open html files in kde..
2007-01-26T12:26:00.000Z	mustaukko	joeamined	try to use firefox, or opera. they are really sweet programs too.
2007-01-26T12:27:00.000Z	joeamined	mustaukko	: i'm using kopete for instant messanging not for web browsing
2007-01-26T12:27:00.000Z	mustaukko	joeamined	uups.. Sorry, my bad.
2007-01-26T12:27:00.000Z	mustaukko	joeamined	but the there is gaim
2007-01-26T12:27:00.000Z	mustaukko	joeamined	Sweet program that too! :)
2007-01-26T12:28:00.000Z	joeamined	mustaukko	: np prob :) do you know how to specify default web browser for kde apps ?
2007-01-26T12:28:00.000Z	mustaukko	joeamined	lets see.
2007-01-26T12:29:00.000Z	mustaukko	joeamined	kcontrol -> KDE Components -> Component Chooser
2007-01-26T12:29:00.000Z	joeamined	mustaukko	: i'm using gnome  :-S and kopete in gnome
2007-01-26T12:30:00.000Z	mustaukko	joeamined	yeah that's tough. using kde apps, and not having the tools to go with it..
