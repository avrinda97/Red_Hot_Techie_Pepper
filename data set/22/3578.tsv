2008-08-13T18:54:00.000Z	bullgard4		How can I make a table which associates a key of my IBM Thinkpad T42 keyboard and its associated keycode, and this for all the 100+ keys?
2008-08-13T18:55:00.000Z	MikeSeth	bullgard4	xev no good?
2008-08-13T19:28:00.000Z	bullgard4	MikeSeth	xev works. But is tedious.
2008-08-13T19:29:00.000Z	MikeSeth	bullgard4	maybe see documentation for tpb package
2008-08-13T19:38:00.000Z	bullgard4	MikeSeth	I was considering to install tpb before. But some guru discouraged me from doing so.  --  The file /usr/share/hotkey-setup/ibm.hk includes 8 lines " Canonical mapping, commented out." I do not understand them, and so I did not install tpb yet.
2008-08-14T17:40:00.000Z	MikeSeth	bullgard4	your driver is i8x0, you can identify your specific card chip by doing lspci -l
2008-08-14T17:44:00.000Z	bullgard4	MikeSeth	I did identify my soundchip before. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting requires me to determine  the NAME OF my  SOUNDCARD'S DRIVER. Having got this information, my T42 laptop still does not produce sound. Why?
2008-08-14T17:45:00.000Z	MikeSeth	bullgard4	most often hardware mixer is set to silence
2008-08-14T17:45:00.000Z	MikeSeth	bullgard4	you are on alsa right?
2008-08-14T17:45:00.000Z	MikeSeth	bullgard4	apt-get install aumix
2008-08-14T17:46:00.000Z	MikeSeth	bullgard4	then run aumix and see that it loads ok and that relevant channel volume is set properly
2008-08-14T17:47:00.000Z	bullgard4	MikeSeth	The Device is a Intel 82801DB-ICH4 (Alsa Mixer).
2008-08-14T17:47:00.000Z	MikeSeth	bullgard4	yeah, i8x0
2008-08-14T17:49:00.000Z	bullgard4	MikeSeth	I have installed aumix now.
2008-08-14T17:50:00.000Z	MikeSeth	bullgard4	so run it. if it refuses to start, driver/device problem
2008-08-14T17:52:00.000Z	bullgard4	MikeSeth	aumix loads all right. Line and Mic are at 0 level. The rest is not at 0 level.
2008-08-14T17:53:00.000Z	bullgard4	MikeSeth	err!  Line, IGain, Line1, PhoneIn  and Mic are at 0 level. The rest is not at 0 level.
2008-08-14T17:54:00.000Z	MikeSeth	bullgard4	what happens when you press thinkpad volume buttons?
2008-08-14T17:58:00.000Z	bullgard4	MikeSeth	I did operate the additional T42 volume/mute buttons. Now I can play my CD-ROM again. And also Sound Preferences > Sound Events > Sound playback > Autodetect > Test works all right.
2008-08-14T17:59:00.000Z	MikeSeth	bullgard4	so you're set
2008-08-14T17:59:00.000Z	bullgard4	MikeSeth	Thank you very much for your enduring hekp.
2008-08-14T17:59:00.000Z	MikeSeth	bullgard4	*bows*
