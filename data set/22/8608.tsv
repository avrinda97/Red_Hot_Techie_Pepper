2006-11-28T11:47:00.000Z	dutch		hey, im a little stuck with my nvidia driver install
2006-11-28T11:48:00.000Z	dutch		reading the wiki, it tells me to install a restricted modules package, dependant on which kernel i have isntalled
2006-11-28T11:48:00.000Z	dutch		but right now, a generic kernel is installed now, not a 386 kernel
2006-11-28T11:48:00.000Z	dutch		anybody know more about nvidia-glx configuration?
2006-11-28T11:48:00.000Z	dabaR	dutch	aptitude search restricted install the appropriate one
2006-11-28T11:49:00.000Z	dutch	dabaR	but which is the appropriate? it already has generic restricted modules installed, but not 386 ones
2006-11-28T11:51:00.000Z	dutch	dabaR	i already have linux-restricted-modules-generic installed, but the wiki says if i have generic installed, it wont work...is it lying?
2006-11-28T11:51:00.000Z	dabaR	dutch	generic is for 64 bit, 486 is for x86 arch
2006-11-28T11:51:00.000Z	dabaR	dutch	or at least that is what the page says
2006-11-28T11:52:00.000Z	dutch	dabaR	okay then, hopefully that works
2006-11-28T11:52:00.000Z	dabaR	dutch	try and let me know
2006-11-28T11:52:00.000Z	dutch	dabaR	thanks
2006-11-28T11:53:00.000Z	dutch	dabaR	yeah, running that just tells me: "linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-generic is already the newest version"
2006-11-28T11:53:00.000Z	dutch	dabaR	so, iam good?
2006-11-28T11:53:00.000Z	dabaR	dutch	noiesmo gave you that command, I am still telling you to use the -386 not -generic
2006-11-28T11:54:00.000Z	dutch	dabaR	oh lol alrighty
2006-11-28T11:55:00.000Z	dutch	dabaR	okay then, running that is installing nvidia-glx and all that good stuff too, so hopefully im cool. thanks for the help
