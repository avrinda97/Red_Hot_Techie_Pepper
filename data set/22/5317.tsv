2007-05-27T08:25:00.000Z	Rode1	Polygon89	i have unmounted and then tried ot change its system but i get teh same message back
2007-05-27T08:25:00.000Z	Rode1	Polygon89	no... but that is what i shall try now
2007-05-27T08:28:00.000Z	Rode1	Polygon89	if i refresh ro clsoe and reopen it remounts itself...
2007-05-27T08:28:00.000Z	Rode1	Polygon89	sdb
2007-05-27T08:29:00.000Z	Polygon89	Rode1	as is it a internal hard drive, or is it a external hard drive
2007-05-27T08:29:00.000Z	Rode1	Polygon89	oh... Internal
2007-05-27T08:31:00.000Z	Rode1	Polygon89	That is what i am doing.... i currently on a live CD... using GParted
2007-05-27T08:31:00.000Z	Polygon89	Rode1	and its still mounting your hard drive? hmm.
2007-05-27T08:33:00.000Z	Rode1	Polygon89	when i right click->info at the bottom it says "Warning: Unable to read the contents of this filesystem! Because of this some operations may be unavailable. Did you install the correct plugin for this filesystem?"
2007-05-27T08:34:00.000Z	Polygon89	Rode1	 what kind of filesystem is on the drive?
2007-05-27T08:35:00.000Z	Rode1	Polygon89	There is half of it formated as ntfs with windows on it... and now there is a corrupted almost half of ext3 and then there is a small portion of unallocated
2007-05-27T08:35:00.000Z	Polygon89	Rode1	are you right click > info on which one?
2007-05-27T08:36:00.000Z	Polygon89	Rode1	whoops i meant which one is giving you that message
2007-05-27T08:36:00.000Z	Rode1	Polygon89	the second one, ext3... which i want ot be ext2
2007-05-27T08:36:00.000Z	Polygon89	Rode1	so the ext3 one is corrupt? and you dont care about formatting  it?
2007-05-27T08:37:00.000Z	Rode1	Polygon89	possibly? i dont care for the ext3 i need a chunk of ext2... but it wont let me have that
2007-05-27T08:39:00.000Z	Polygon89	Rode1	ok, so if you dont care for the ext3 one, your just going to format it. So does it not give you the option to change the file system? (cause it is still mounted?)
2007-05-27T08:40:00.000Z	Rode1	Polygon89	If i right click i can click on "unmount" and if i do so it unmounts in but then if i click "format to" and "ext2" then click "apply" it gives an error saying its mounted
2007-05-27T08:42:00.000Z	Polygon89	Rode1	ok it should list the drive that you are trying to unmount (like /dev/sdwhatever) so, open a terminal, and try once again a "sudo umount /dev/sdwhatever) and then once that is done, go back to gparted, go to "gparted > refresh devices" and try again
2007-05-27T08:44:00.000Z	Rode1	Polygon89	Same error
2007-05-27T08:44:00.000Z	Polygon89	Rode1	you say that you have multiple partitions on the same drive. Try using that umount command on all partitions on that hard drive, then try again
2007-05-27T08:47:00.000Z	Rode1	Polygon89	It worked! :D Thanks... now i shall try to reinstall
