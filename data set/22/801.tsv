2011-03-19T00:52:00.000Z	toto654		hello everybody, i had a kernel update today, and i dont see windows anymore when i reboot, how i fix this
2011-03-19T00:52:00.000Z	edbian	toto654	sudo update-grub
2011-03-19T00:52:00.000Z	edbian	toto654	See if that fixes it first.
2011-03-19T00:53:00.000Z	toto654	edbian	i rather not touch the grub
2011-03-19T00:53:00.000Z	edbian	toto654	Well that's what you have change :)
2011-03-19T00:54:00.000Z	toto654	edbian	its just i have too many kernel to chose...if i remember i can delete some, just forgot how
2011-03-19T00:54:00.000Z	edbian	toto654	?  You don't have to touch them.  This command will not change them.
2011-03-19T00:55:00.000Z	toto654	edbian	last time i used upgrade grub...i had to log on the live cd loll....its a very scary cmd to me
2011-03-19T00:56:00.000Z	edbian	toto654	Then don't run it.  I don't know what to tell you.  It is grub that is not allowing you to boot windows.
2011-03-19T00:58:00.000Z	toto654	edbian	if i use upgrade grub...will it erase some kernels...just wondering
2011-03-19T00:58:00.000Z	edbian	toto654	no
2011-03-19T00:58:00.000Z	toto654	edbian	so how can i see windows when i reboot if it doesnt erase kernels
2011-03-19T00:58:00.000Z	edbian	toto654	That command does not upgrade grub's software.  It actually updates the list of operating systems by scanning what ones are installed on the hdd.
2011-03-19T01:00:00.000Z	toto654	edbian	i just see i dont have grub installed...maybe i install it, and be able to delete some kernels
2011-03-19T01:00:00.000Z	edbian	toto654	You do have grub installed or Ubuntu would not boot.
2011-03-19T01:00:00.000Z	toto654	edbian	is there a grub gui somewhere
2011-03-19T01:01:00.000Z	toto654	edbian	i typed grub via terminal...tells me its not intalled
2011-03-19T01:01:00.000Z	edbian	toto654	no
2011-03-19T01:01:00.000Z	edbian	toto654	'grub' is not a command or a package.  run the command I told you and see if it fixes the problem.  sudo update-grub
2011-03-19T01:02:00.000Z	toto654	edbian	i see windows in the log after udpate-grub, i reboot
2011-03-19T01:02:00.000Z	edbian	toto654	Was that a question?
2011-03-19T01:02:00.000Z	toto654	edbian	no
