2005-07-31T05:10:00.000Z	igge		because I think that all kde stuff is made using qt... (right?)
2005-07-31T05:12:00.000Z	igge		is there really no package for eclipse? (or is it just me how hasn't enabled the right thing)
2005-07-31T05:12:00.000Z	timl	igge	it exists in universe
2005-07-31T05:12:00.000Z	timl		apt-cache search eclipse should bring it up for you
2005-07-31T05:13:00.000Z	timl		oh, universe in breezy, not sure about hoary
2005-07-31T05:14:00.000Z	igge		hm.. but when I search in Synaptic I only find eclipse-nls-sdk
2005-07-31T05:14:00.000Z	igge		and I have all repositories enabled
2005-07-31T05:16:00.000Z	timl	igge	could you paste you /etc/atp/sources.list in a pastebin for us?
2005-07-31T05:16:00.000Z	igge	timl	ok hang on
2005-07-31T05:17:00.000Z	igge		heh.... hm.... cat: /etc/atp/sources.list: No such file or directory
2005-07-31T05:17:00.000Z	timl		sorry, apt, not atp
2005-07-31T05:17:00.000Z	igge		ah.. ok..
2005-07-31T05:18:00.000Z	igge	timl	http://pastebin.com/320974
2005-07-31T05:19:00.000Z	timl	igge	ok, I think the problem might be that eclipse doesn't exist in hoary
2005-07-31T05:19:00.000Z	timl		it does however exist in breezy
2005-07-31T05:20:00.000Z	timl		there are ways and means of getting a package from breezy while keeping everything else at hoary, but someone else will have to explain that to you
2005-07-31T05:20:00.000Z	igge	timl	ok...
2005-07-31T05:20:00.000Z	igge	timl	or can I activate some other debian repository and get it from there?
2005-07-31T05:21:00.000Z	igge		i'm a debian/ubuntu newbie but used to fedora...
2005-07-31T05:21:00.000Z	timl		you probably could do that, but again, I wouldn't want to be the one to tak eyou through it, i havn't done enough of that kind of thing
2005-07-31T05:21:00.000Z	timl		and I wouldn't want to break your system
2005-07-31T05:22:00.000Z	igge	timl	ok
