2005-07-04T13:46:00.000Z	rafa-		when i start the computer, ubuntu doesn't start the network interfaces
2005-07-04T13:46:00.000Z	rafa-		and i think that's why gnome isn't working
2005-07-04T13:46:00.000Z	rafa-		could someone please tell me how to correct that?
2005-07-04T13:47:00.000Z	rafa-		yes
2005-07-04T13:47:00.000Z	rafa-		i do that
2005-07-04T13:47:00.000Z	djm62	rafa-	that would happen if the lo interface wasn't loading, which can happen if your /etc/network/interfaces file is messed up
2005-07-04T13:47:00.000Z	djm62	rafa-	when did this stop working?
2005-07-04T13:48:00.000Z	rafa-	djm62	like the third time i booted up
2005-07-04T13:49:00.000Z	djm62	rafa-	had you done anything unusual to it, or had anything unusual happened, before it stopped working
2005-07-04T13:49:00.000Z	djm62	rafa-	paste your /etc/network/interfaces file to the place mentioned in /topic
2005-07-04T13:50:00.000Z	djm62	rafa-	and tell us the url
2005-07-04T13:53:00.000Z	djm62	rafa-	left-click and drag over the text, paste with middle button (or left and right simultaneously)

2005-07-04T13:55:00.000Z	djm62	rafa-	that last line makes zerosense
2005-07-04T13:56:00.000Z	rafa-	djm62	the last line of my interfaces?
2005-07-04T13:56:00.000Z	djm62	rafa-	delete it
2005-07-04T13:56:00.000Z	djm62	rafa-	it's a fragment of a good line, and it's probably confused everything else
2005-07-04T14:06:00.000Z	rafa-	djm62	thank you!
2005-07-04T14:07:00.000Z	djm62	rafa-	all good...be careful when you touch files in /etc ;)
2005-07-04T14:07:00.000Z	rafa-	djm62	it wasn't me, i think it was kde
