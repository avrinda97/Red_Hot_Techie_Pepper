2006-10-29T13:34:00.000Z	MrObvious		Here's a simple question: Is there a way I can get a Ubuntu deb for firefox 2?
2006-10-29T13:36:00.000Z	poningru	MrObvious	you can just upgrade to edgy
2006-10-29T13:36:00.000Z	MrObvious	poningru	Edgy?
2006-10-29T13:37:00.000Z	poningru	MrObvious	edgy has firefox 2.0 already
2006-10-29T13:37:00.000Z	MrObvious	poningru	I haven't been really trying to keep up with Linux very well. What's edgy?
2006-10-29T13:37:00.000Z	poningru	MrObvious	you know ubuntu's stable

2006-10-29T13:37:00.000Z	MrObvious	poningru	I know. Is that a version of Ubuntu that came out or something recently? Sorry I'm running on 4 hours of sleep.
