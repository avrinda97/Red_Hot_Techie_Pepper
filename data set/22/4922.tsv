2007-09-10T10:06:00.000Z	yaser		hi, im trying to install a package with Gdebi it says it depends on "libwnck18" wich im sure it is installed, why can it be?
2007-09-10T10:07:00.000Z	stefg	yaser	try on the command line with sudo dpkg -i *.deb
2007-09-10T10:08:00.000Z	yaser	stefg	ok
2007-09-10T10:14:00.000Z	yaser	stefg	well the problem is with the version, i have installed version 2.14 and i need 2.18, when i try to install 2.18 it depends on libwcnk-common(2.18) when i try to install this one, i get an error because i have installed a newr version, what can i do in this case?
2007-09-10T10:15:00.000Z	stefg	yaser	this package isn't made for ubuntu, probably it's for debian. i wouldn't recommend using it
2007-09-10T10:15:00.000Z	yaser	stefg	wich package do you refer?
2007-09-10T10:15:00.000Z	stefg	yaser	what are you trying to install ?
2007-09-10T10:16:00.000Z	yaser	stefg	avant navigator
2007-09-10T10:16:00.000Z	yaser	stefg	in Gutsy
2007-09-10T10:17:00.000Z	stefg	yaser	you can only try to build from source
2007-09-10T10:17:00.000Z	yaser	stefg	ok
2007-10-11T06:02:00.000Z	stefg	yaser	sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
2007-10-11T06:04:00.000Z	yaser	stefg	thks
2007-10-30T00:37:00.000Z	stefg	yaser	if you want flash and codecs then stick with 32-bit. The performance gain of 64bit isn't worth the trouble
2007-10-30T00:37:00.000Z	yaser	stefg	codecs have trubles?
2007-10-30T00:38:00.000Z	stefg	yaser	w32codecs... wmv9 and stuff
2007-10-30T00:39:00.000Z	yaser	stefg	ikonia isnt it very sad to have a 64bit machine and dont use the whole of its capacities?
2007-10-30T00:41:00.000Z	stefg	yaser	tbeory and practice. in a perfect world we would have all software available in 64bit and fully 64bit optimized algo's. the parctice is: the performance gain is minimal, because most software isn't 64 bit optimized, or even available for 64bit. so you need a 32bit chroot on a 64bit machine and ugly stuff like that
2007-10-30T00:42:00.000Z	yaser	stefg	ok thanks very much
2007-10-30T00:42:00.000Z	yaser	stefg	i thought with gutsy most of the problems were gone
2007-10-30T00:43:00.000Z	stefg	yaser	'gutsy' and 'problems gone' don't fit into one sentence :-\
2007-10-30T00:44:00.000Z	yaser	stefg	:-)
