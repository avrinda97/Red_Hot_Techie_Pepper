2007-08-29T06:20:00.000Z	hipitihop		I have a small home network of 6 machines some wireless and some wired. Is there any tool I can install to monitor and preferably assign quotas per machine for internet usage ?
2007-08-29T06:21:00.000Z	Slart	hipitihop	you can use iptables for almost anything... it just takes some work
2007-08-29T06:23:00.000Z	hipitihop	Slart	isn't firtestarter just a firewall ?
2007-08-29T06:24:00.000Z	Slart	hipitihop	firewall, router, gateway, coffee-machine.. iptables can do almost anything as I said =)
2007-08-29T06:25:00.000Z	hipitihop	Slart	I'm sure, but that's why I am on here as I'm a bit of a noob so would need step by step instructions
2007-08-29T06:26:00.000Z	Slart	hipitihop	I haven't done it myself so I can't give you the detailed tour.... I'll see if I can find something on the net.. (you
2007-08-29T06:27:00.000Z	Slart	hipitihop	you're looking for something that does traffic shaping with quotas or similar
2007-08-29T06:28:00.000Z	hipitihop	Slart	I think so.. I have a 12Gb cap per month on my cable, I want to allocate a percentage per machine on network
2007-08-29T06:30:00.000Z	Slart	hipitihop	yes.. that's what I expect to find.. quota by dhcp-client or something alone those lines
2007-08-29T06:31:00.000Z	hipitihop	Slart	most of the machines are wireless if that makes any differnece and crrently I have them all on static ip but could change if that makes life eaier to achieve this
2007-08-29T06:32:00.000Z	Slart	hipitihop	I'll see what I find.. but I don't think linux makes a difference between wireless traffic and wired traffic
2007-08-29T06:33:00.000Z	hipitihop	Slart	I wasn't sure as obviously the wireless puters are connected directly to wireless router which is also doing the cable internet sharing
2007-08-29T06:33:00.000Z	Slart	hipitihop	as long as the traffic comes from different ip's for each computer it should be fine
2007-08-29T06:51:00.000Z	Slart	hipitihop	shorewall does traffic shaping according to it's homepage www.shorewall.net
2007-08-29T06:51:00.000Z	hipitihop	Slart	looking...
2007-08-29T06:52:00.000Z	hipitihop	Slart	while installing Cacti via synaptic I got "libphp-adodb is no longer installed in /usr/share/adodb. New installation path is now /usr/share/php/adodb.
2007-08-29T06:53:00.000Z	Slart	hipitihop	eh.. ok.. take a look in php.ini and see if you can find anything related to libphp-adodb.. perhaps there is a path somewhere that needs to be fixed
2007-08-29T06:55:00.000Z	Slart	hipitihop	It seems that even shorewall requires some knowledge of iptables and shaping.. it's not a turn-key solution
2007-08-29T06:56:00.000Z	hipitihop	Slart	I see, still looking for php.ini
2007-08-29T06:56:00.000Z	Slart	hipitihop	check in /etc or do a "find / | grep -i php.ini"
2007-08-29T07:06:00.000Z	hipitihop	Slart	I'm going to try and see if I can get Cacti going....thanks for your help.
2007-08-29T07:06:00.000Z	Slart	hipitihop	good luck
