2009-12-01T02:21:00.000Z	pfred1		Can anyone tell me if it is possible to enable single click action in Gnome?
2009-12-01T02:23:00.000Z	pfred1		Is there a panel in Gnome where i can configure it to disable double clicking?
2009-12-01T02:24:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	pfred1	Tried the mouse preferences?
2009-12-01T02:24:00.000Z	pfred1	Stupendoussteve	I'll give that a look thanks.
2009-12-01T02:25:00.000Z	pfred1	Stupendoussteve	doesn't look possible just double click timeout I think Gnome likes to double click :(
2009-12-01T02:25:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	pfred1	Try in nautilus. Open a folder and look for preferences, I think it's in File or Edit (not in gnome atm)
2009-12-01T02:26:00.000Z	pfred1	Stupendoussteve	I am not familiar with nautilus is it like the window manager that comes with Ubuntu 9.10?
2009-12-01T02:26:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	pfred1	It's the file manager
2009-12-01T02:26:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	pfred1	It's what the icons are displayed in :) So its preferences should let you choose single click
2009-12-01T02:27:00.000Z	pfred1	Stupendoussteve	OK I would like single click for desktop launchers too I'm new to Gnome was a KDE fan for a long time.

2009-12-01T02:28:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	pfred1	Open up a folder then go to Edit > Preferences > Behavior
2009-12-01T02:28:00.000Z	pfred1	Stupendoussteve	sweet! that's one down now let me find that for the desktop
2009-12-01T02:29:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	pfred1	It should carry over
2009-12-01T02:29:00.000Z	pfred1	Stupendoussteve	whoot! It does!
