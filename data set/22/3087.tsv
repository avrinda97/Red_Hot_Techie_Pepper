2011-01-08T17:24:00.000Z	Mrokii		hello. Is there a way to play a Video-CD that is just mounted from an ISO-image (not a real CD)?
2011-01-08T17:24:00.000Z	bazhang	Mrokii	via vlc sure
2011-01-08T17:25:00.000Z	Mrokii	bazhang	But how? I can't use the vlc-device and I don't know how else I should start the video-CD or which file(s) I should choose in vlc.
2011-01-08T17:25:00.000Z	bazhang	Mrokii	right click open with vlc
2011-01-08T17:26:00.000Z	Mrokii	bazhang	Thanks, I will try that.
2012-06-25T19:02:00.000Z	bazhang	Mrokii	since PPA are disabled on version upgrade, you'd need to re-enable them if a higher compatible version exists
2012-06-25T19:03:00.000Z	bazhang	Mrokii	some PPA *might* work with a difference in version, though that would be risky and depend on the nature of the PPA

2012-06-25T19:05:00.000Z	bazhang	Mrokii	thats correct, was there some question about that?
2012-06-25T19:06:00.000Z	bazhang	Mrokii	thats what is necessary to the best of my knowledge, as the ubuntu system wont check it for you
2012-06-25T19:06:00.000Z	Mrokii	bazhang	I'm not talking about re-enabling as such. As it stands at the moment, I have to visit each of the PPAs and check if they have updated the source to 12.04
2012-06-25T19:06:00.000Z	bazhang	Mrokii	it would complain if the version was causing problems, thats about it
2012-06-25T19:07:00.000Z	bazhang	Mrokii	I think he missed the context of your question
2012-10-09T21:30:00.000Z	bazhang	Mrokii	thats app armor
2012-10-09T21:30:00.000Z	Mrokii	bazhang	oops, yes, "app armor". But what is this about?
2012-11-20T17:10:00.000Z	bazhang	Mrokii	yes. there is an arrow that leads to a menu saying, dont ask again
2012-11-20T17:10:00.000Z	Mrokii	bazhang	Hm, okay. Didn't notice that yet, but I will look. Thanks.
2012-11-20T17:12:00.000Z	Mrokii	bazhang	I have no clue what you're talking about, honestly. Was that a remark about me asking the question once more or an actual answer? If so, I don't see anything like what you described.
2012-11-20T17:13:00.000Z	bazhang	Mrokii	a small popup window that appears in the address bar of Firefox? I thought that was your issue
2012-11-20T17:15:00.000Z	Mrokii	bazhang	Yes, but not only in Firefox. And it has four options, Open in Mozilla, Open in Firefox, Open in Opera (I think) and something else I forgot. That's all. Strange thing is it doesn't always appear and I don't know how to either disable it or change the (for me) useless options.
2012-11-20T17:16:00.000Z	bazhang	Mrokii	that sounds somewhat different on second listening as you have further clarified
2012-11-20T17:17:00.000Z	Mrokii	bazhang	Sorry for not explaining it properly. I just don't get where this is coming from, but as it's not only FX where it appeard (Thunderbird and Chrome as well) I assume it must be some Ubuntu-thing.
