2008-01-08T19:36:00.000Z	LuCypher		Hi, I can't install msttcorefonts... I don't really need it , but I can't remove it too http://pastebin.ubuntu-nl.org/51196/
2008-01-08T19:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LuCypher	How are you trying to remove msttcorefonts?
2008-01-08T19:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LuCypher	Does synaptic show it as installed?
2008-01-08T19:37:00.000Z	LuCypher	Jack_Sparrow	: yes
2008-01-08T19:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LuCypher	Have you tried to remove it from there?
2008-01-08T19:37:00.000Z	LuCypher	Jack_Sparrow	: yes
2008-01-08T19:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LuCypher	Does it give you an error or tell you what to do to fix it?
2008-01-08T19:38:00.000Z	LuCypher	Jack_Sparrow	: every time I try to remove it it starts with "pre-removal script" that is the same "post-install"
2008-01-08T19:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LuCypher	I take it you are cancelling it out at that point?
2008-01-08T19:41:00.000Z	LuCypher	Jack_Sparrow	: I left it go... But when finished it says that some of the *.exe cab is corrupted and gives me: "pre-removal script sub-process has given error code1"
2008-01-08T19:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LuCypher	SOmething odd here...How were they installed.  and if you say you used automatix or envy scripts to install anything I am gonna scream..
2008-01-08T19:44:00.000Z	LuCypher	Jack_Sparrow	: I stay away from Envy or Automatix
2008-01-08T19:44:00.000Z	LuCypher	Jack_Sparrow	: It was installed as a dependency of ubuntu-restricted-extras
2008-01-08T19:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LuCypher	Good to know you never tried or used automatix...  We have seen way to many problems these last couple days.  Are you running something under wine in the background ?
2008-01-08T19:46:00.000Z	LuCypher	Jack_Sparrow	:  ps aux | grep wine ........ nothing
2008-01-08T19:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LuCypher	Oh, and is this a real install or some vm optional setup?
2008-01-08T19:47:00.000Z	LuCypher	Jack_Sparrow	:  Real install... As I've done it many times before...
2008-01-08T19:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LuCypher	Sorry , I am at a loss on this.. maybe after I finish my morning coffee I will have something, hopefully you will get an answer before that.
2008-01-08T19:48:00.000Z	LuCypher	Jack_Sparrow	:  Is there any way I can tell apt-get to remove but don't do configure (pre-remove)???
2008-01-08T19:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LuCypher	You can purge it, but my concern is the corrupt *.exe cab files... this problem is the tip of the iceberg
2008-01-08T19:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LuCypher	Are you running the repo version of wine or an upgraded version
2008-01-08T19:56:00.000Z	LuCypher	Jack_Sparrow	:  Sorry... I was googling... I have no wine installed, but I don't think it's needed, it uses cabextract to install fonts
