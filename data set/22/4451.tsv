2008-05-24T07:01:00.000Z	el1te		when it uses a media player the media player has codecs to make 5.1 audio streams right? well gaming is completely different it "ENCODES" to 5,1
2008-05-24T07:02:00.000Z	el1te		well baisacally im just saying if linux ppl made the driver it wont do DDL/DTS it will have to be a binary driver with that licensed codec right?
