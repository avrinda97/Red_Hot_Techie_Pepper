2008-01-09T13:12:00.000Z	jxxt		Is it safe to shrink my ubuntu partition then expand the ntfs by the amount I shrunk ubuntu???? gparted
2008-01-09T13:12:00.000Z	vasilisa	jxxt	you cant expan a partition to the left
2008-01-09T13:13:00.000Z	jxxt	vasilisa	can I change the position of the partion??
2008-01-09T13:13:00.000Z	vasilisa	jxxt	If you shrink a partition, you cant really do anything with the freed space other than turn it to a new partition....
2008-01-09T13:13:00.000Z	vasilisa	jxxt	No :/ its pretty annoying...
2008-01-09T13:14:00.000Z	jxxt	vasilisa	I messed up a dual boot now windows does not have enough room what to do??
2008-01-09T13:15:00.000Z	vasilisa	jxxt	You dont have enough room? how's your drive divvied up exactly?
2008-01-09T13:16:00.000Z	jxxt		26gig for win the balance of a 60gig for linux and swap
2008-01-09T13:16:00.000Z	vasilisa	jxxt	26 gigs isnt enough? Do you need to remove something from it?
2008-01-09T13:17:00.000Z	jxxt	vasilisa	My daughters machine she has a huge amount of data and games
2008-01-09T13:18:00.000Z	jxxt	vasilisa	Maybe I need to reinstall and but the ubuntu on correctly this time
2008-01-09T13:18:00.000Z	vasilisa	jxxt	Well in this case id say you just need to clear some room on it so it'll boot. You can access windows partitions in linux.
2008-01-09T13:18:00.000Z	vasilisa	jxxt	Well you could reinstall ubuntu on a partition further to the right and then expand the windows one, yes
2008-01-09T13:19:00.000Z	jxxt	vasilisa	OK that sounds like a plan
2008-01-09T13:19:00.000Z	vasilisa	jxxt	But it's probably going to be just as easy to temporarily clean it up until you can add some space...
2008-01-09T13:19:00.000Z	vasilisa	jxxt	Just remember, partitions can only grow to the right, not left.
2008-01-09T13:20:00.000Z	jxxt	vasilisa	I have a 30gig usb drive I can throw some stuff on
2008-01-09T13:20:00.000Z	jxxt	vasilisa	I will remember
2008-01-09T13:20:00.000Z	vasilisa	jxxt	okie dokie
2008-01-09T13:21:00.000Z	jxxt	vasilisa	TY :-))
2008-01-09T13:21:00.000Z	vasilisa	jxxt	No prob, i know all this very well :P I cant tell you how long it took me to figure out fricking partitions
2008-01-09T13:21:00.000Z	vasilisa	jxxt	xD
