2005-11-08T08:47:00.000Z	bob2	Aven	the unrealircd people haeve shown themselves to be morons time and again
2005-11-08T08:47:00.000Z	bob2	Aven	install build-essential
2005-11-08T08:47:00.000Z	Aven	bob2	what's that?
2005-11-08T09:36:00.000Z	bob2	Aven	uh
2005-11-08T09:36:00.000Z	bob2	Aven	make your user own it
2005-11-08T09:36:00.000Z	Aven	bob2	exactly what I want!
2005-11-08T09:37:00.000Z	bob2	Aven	chown username /var/www/
2005-11-18T16:28:00.000Z	bob2	Aven	what are you trying to do?
2005-11-18T16:28:00.000Z	bob2	Aven	and the software is...
2005-11-18T16:29:00.000Z	bob2	Aven	export CC=gcc-3.4, may work
2005-11-18T16:30:00.000Z	bob2	Aven	it's software-specific, tho, which is why you need to mention exactly what you're trying to do in your initial questions
2005-11-18T16:30:00.000Z	Aven	bob2	when I run the 'make' command, it uses gcc 4
2005-11-18T16:33:00.000Z	bob2	Aven	yes, it's software specific
2005-11-18T16:33:00.000Z	bob2	Aven	you may need to hack the Makefile
2005-11-18T16:33:00.000Z	bob2	Aven	simplest would be talking to the author
