2010-01-20T11:56:00.000Z	jstoone	keepsake	How did you find that so quick?
2010-01-20T11:57:00.000Z	keepsake	jstoone	The powers of Google =P
2010-01-20T11:57:00.000Z	jstoone	keepsake	what did you search 'cause I have been searching all over the place!
2010-01-20T11:58:00.000Z	keepsake	jstoone	"gnome terminal start directory"
2010-01-20T12:01:00.000Z	jstoone	keepsake	typical, my searches is to advanced xD
2010-01-20T12:04:00.000Z	jstoone	keepsake	Thanks! It works. (:
2010-01-20T12:04:00.000Z	keepsake	jstoone	=D
2010-01-20T12:13:00.000Z	keepsake	jstoone	Alternately you can look for headers, but that's a little more complicated =P
2010-01-20T12:14:00.000Z	jstoone	keepsake	would you care telling more about that? (:
2010-01-20T12:14:00.000Z	keepsake	jstoone	Well PNG images and RAR files have distinct headers
2010-01-20T12:14:00.000Z	keepsake	jstoone	If you hex edit and find the header you'll be able to separate them
2010-01-20T12:15:00.000Z	jstoone	keepsake	do you recommend any program for HEX editing?
2010-01-20T12:16:00.000Z	keepsake	jstoone	Not really, anything works
2010-01-20T12:18:00.000Z	jstoone	keepsake	Anything? Well I know that I cannot open a file with the .rar extension with   gedit
2010-01-20T12:18:00.000Z	keepsake	jstoone	There are a lot of them, for example, ghex or something
2010-01-20T12:22:00.000Z	jstoone	keepsake	Now I typed   "sudo apt-get install ghex" and it installed but how do I open a fire with this program?
2010-01-20T12:23:00.000Z	keepsake	jstoone	"ghex /path/to/file"?
2010-01-20T12:27:00.000Z	jstoone	keepsake	now I got into my Downloads dir in my home folder and in here i wrote "ghex skype-installer-blabla.deb" and it out puts something like "did you mean 'hex' instead of 'ghex'"...
