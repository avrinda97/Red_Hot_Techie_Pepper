2007-05-05T08:58:00.000Z	LtL	moleboy	- system > administation > network configure your wireless device there.
2007-05-05T09:00:00.000Z	LtL	moleboy	- that is provided the device loaded as Pelo stated. 'dmesg' in a xterm will reveal some info, also 'lsmod'
2007-05-05T09:01:00.000Z	moleboy	LtL	I went to system > administration > network
2007-05-05T09:01:00.000Z	LtL	moleboy	- isyour wifi card listed?
2007-05-05T09:01:00.000Z	LtL	moleboy	- ok, it did not load. pcmcia card?
2007-05-05T09:03:00.000Z	LtL	moleboy	- type 'lsusb -vvv' in an xterm
2007-05-05T09:04:00.000Z	LtL	moleboy	- correct
2007-05-05T09:05:00.000Z	LtL	moleboy	- you need to identify the chipset and or why the system didn't see or load it. then google
2007-05-05T09:06:00.000Z	LtL	moleboy	- does lsusb -v show anything
2007-05-05T09:08:00.000Z	LtL	moleboy	- i've never used usb for WAN access. So all i can say is google it or try ubuntuguide
2007-05-05T09:09:00.000Z	LtL	moleboy	- the internet wide area net. try googling
2007-05-05T09:19:00.000Z	LtL	moleboy	- a system admin just told me he knew of two ppl that tried 2wire/usb. Avoid it, they went 4 wire.
