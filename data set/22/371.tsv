2011-11-11T03:32:00.000Z	danely		Hello, i am using 2 Servers with ubuntu 10.04 LTS. And i try to sync a folder on each of the servers. The folder has 160GB on server A, 270GB on server B. Server A is the unison server and accesses Server B via SSH. Once Unison starts the scan everything works fine. Server A finishes its scan and says "  Waiting for changes from server ". Then after some time Server B hangs and is no longer responsive (neither ping or anyhting). I can'
2011-11-11T03:32:00.000Z	danely		Any suggestions?
2011-11-11T03:32:00.000Z	KageMusha	danely	tried rsync?
2011-11-11T03:33:00.000Z	danely	KageMusha	no, since unison uses the rsync protocol and i want it to work 2 ways
2011-11-11T03:34:00.000Z	KageMusha	danely	so you want to to sync changes on both sides?
2011-11-11T03:34:00.000Z	danely	KageMusha	Yes. but what worries me more is that not only unison crashes but the whole server. no ssh, ping or anything
2011-11-11T03:35:00.000Z	KageMusha	danely	can still be done with rsync over ssh.. but it is strange that unison crashes.
2011-11-11T03:37:00.000Z	KageMusha	danely	do you use a vanilla kernel or homemade?
2011-11-11T03:37:00.000Z	danely	KageMusha	vanilla: 2.6.32-35-server #78-Ubuntu SMP Tue Oct 11
2011-11-11T03:37:00.000Z	KageMusha	danely	and when you use rsync do you use the syntax: rsync -avz -e ssh remoteuser@remotehost:/remote/dir /this/dir/
2011-11-11T03:38:00.000Z	danely	KageMusha	right now i use unison with a profile.
2011-11-11T03:38:00.000Z	danely	KageMusha	i haven't tried rsync yet, since that wasn't the way i was going for in the first place
2011-11-11T03:39:00.000Z	KageMusha	danely	ok, I haven't worked with unison that much, use rsync for all that type of stuff.
2011-11-11T03:40:00.000Z	KageMusha	danely	do you happen to know how to build custom ubuntu packages? =P
2011-11-11T03:41:00.000Z	danely	KageMusha	.deb files? i've done it before but it's a mess if you ask me
2011-11-11T03:42:00.000Z	KageMusha	danely	yes I know. But Im not trying to do anything advanced. just add some scripts.
2011-11-11T03:43:00.000Z	KageMusha	danely	I have gotten so far as I can make a package that installs packages that I want, but the files included in the deb file dont end up in the system.
2011-11-11T03:43:00.000Z	danely	KageMusha	i think the best i can help you with is this link: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/index.en.html
2011-11-11T03:43:00.000Z	danely	KageMusha	but i'm pretty sure you know that already ;)
2011-11-11T03:44:00.000Z	danely	KageMusha	the last time i've done that is 2+ years ago. i don't really remember anything, sorry
2011-11-11T03:45:00.000Z	KageMusha	danely	yes, have been looking at a lot of those pages, problem is that what I want to do seems to be too simple to be included.
2011-11-11T03:46:00.000Z	KageMusha	danely	basically I have a standard firewall script. and want to install some standard packages since I install a alot of servers. like lsof, ntpdate and so on. I get the installations but the firewall script doesnt go anywere.
