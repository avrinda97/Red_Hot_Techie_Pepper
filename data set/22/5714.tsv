2007-03-13T14:43:00.000Z	xtknight	Psychoman	 not sure why youre getting that, bruenig's longer cmd wroks for me with no permission problems .  but ya try blkid or 'sudo blkid' if all else fails
2007-03-13T14:45:00.000Z	xtknight	Psychoman	he wanted you to find sda1 i think so it's /dev/sda1: UUID="78a6979f-4b4d-41c1-b7b7-0f4941f1608f"
2007-03-13T14:45:00.000Z	Psychoman	xtknight	i'll add it the same wat to my fstab, brb
2007-03-13T14:51:00.000Z	Psychoman	xtknight	doesn't work yet : mount: special device /dev/disk/by-uuid/78a6979f-4b4d-41c1-b7b7-0f4941f1608f does not exist
2007-03-13T14:51:00.000Z	xtknight	Psychoman	um sorry not sure.  haven't been following your question
2007-03-13T14:52:00.000Z	Psychoman	xtknight	i juste added the UUID to fstab in stead of /dev/sda1 and i got the following problem in my /var/log/boot : mount: special device /dev/disk/by-uuid/78a6979f-4b4d-41c1-b7b7-0f4941f1608f does not exist
2007-03-13T14:52:00.000Z	xtknight	Psychoman	pastebin your fstab
2007-03-13T14:53:00.000Z	Psychoman	xtknight	here it is : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/10264/
2007-03-13T14:54:00.000Z	xtknight	Psychoman	also do 'blkid' again and pastebin
2007-03-13T14:54:00.000Z	Psychoman	xtknight	here it is : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/10265/
2007-03-13T14:55:00.000Z	xtknight	Psychoman	pastebin results of 'sudo mount -a'
2007-03-13T14:55:00.000Z	Psychoman	xtknight	it's empty
2007-03-13T14:56:00.000Z	xtknight	Psychoman	"df -h | grep sda1"  any results?
2007-03-13T14:56:00.000Z	Psychoman	xtknight	my harddisk isn't mounted eather, while with the first entry in fstab (the one i commented) it did mount
2007-03-13T14:56:00.000Z	Psychoman	xtknight	it does : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/10267/
2007-03-13T14:57:00.000Z	xtknight	Psychoman	maybe your usb driver isn't getting loaded when it's trying to mount it or something at boot time.  it looks like it mounted successfully just when you typed 'sudo mount -a'.  so i suggest..well mounting it after the usb driver loads, which i'm not sure how to do.  maybe add a gnome session script for it.
2007-03-13T14:58:00.000Z	Psychoman	xtknight	in /etc/rc.local ?
2007-03-13T14:58:00.000Z	Psychoman	xtknight	i would need the harddisk to be accessed by apache
2007-03-13T14:58:00.000Z	xtknight	Psychoman	hrm maybe.  not familiar with rc.d, et al
2007-03-13T14:58:00.000Z	Psychoman	xtknight	ok thx :)
2007-03-13T14:59:00.000Z	xtknight	Psychoman	i suggest a simple sudo mount -a, or "user,exec,auto" for options.  then you can use mount -a from your user, i think.
2007-03-13T15:05:00.000Z	Psychoman	xtknight	i did add "mount /dev/sda1" in /etc/rc.local and it works now
