2007-05-07T05:41:00.000Z	duelboot	cafuego	I get this e3rror:  [17513.646601]  bcm43xx: TODO: Incomplete code in keymac_write() at drivers/net/wireless/bcm43xx/bcm43xx_main.c:1132
2007-05-07T05:41:00.000Z	duelboot	cafuego	I get this e3rror:  [17513.646601]  bcm43xx: TODO: Incomplete code in keymac_write() at drivers/net/wireless/bcm43xx/bcm43xx_main.c:1132
2007-05-07T05:51:00.000Z	cafuego	duelboot	Just install it.
2007-05-07T05:44:00.000Z	cafuego	duelboot	Then the forums probably gave you bad firmware.
2007-05-07T05:45:00.000Z	cafuego	duelboot	Remove it
2007-05-07T05:45:00.000Z	duelboot	cafuego	I also installed the bcm43xx-firmware from Synaptic and get the same problem
2007-05-07T05:45:00.000Z	duelboot	cafuego	I'll remove the one from the forum though
2007-05-07T05:45:00.000Z	cafuego	duelboot	I use http://ubuntu.cafuego.net/pool/feisty-cafuego/bcm43xx/bcm43xx-firmware_1.3-1ubuntu2_all.deb without problems.
2007-05-07T05:46:00.000Z	duelboot	cafuego	I think I tried that, but I'll do it (again?) just in case
2007-05-07T05:46:00.000Z	cafuego	duelboot	Just be sure to unload the bcm43xx driver from the ekrnel in between tries.
2007-05-07T05:47:00.000Z	duelboot	cafuego	how?
2007-05-07T05:47:00.000Z	cafuego	duelboot	sudo rmmod bcm43xx
2007-05-07T05:50:00.000Z	duelboot	cafuego	Synaptic states the bcm43xx-firmware is for Dapper...is there another one for Fiesty?
2007-05-07T05:57:00.000Z	duelboot	cafuego	had to reboot....it locked up on me...I'll post my dmesg output if you think you can help...

2007-05-07T06:04:00.000Z	duelboot	cafuego	it's my dmesg output with my wireless card info
2007-05-07T06:07:00.000Z	duelboot	cafuego	you there?
2007-05-07T06:19:00.000Z	duelboot	cafuego	I had connection issue...did you respond
