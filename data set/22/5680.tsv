2007-03-20T11:59:00.000Z	jenn		Can someone tell me how do I install latest Nvidia Drivers on my linux thru command promt at start-up?
2007-03-20T12:00:00.000Z	hendrixski	jenn	I'd like to know that myself
2007-03-20T12:01:00.000Z	jenn	hendrixski	I'm new to linux. So it's hard for me to know all the commands. :(
2007-03-20T12:01:00.000Z	jenn	hendrixski	what error does your friend encounter.
2007-03-20T12:01:00.000Z	hendrixski	jenn	I've been using Linux a little bit over a year, and I still don't know all the commands
2007-03-20T12:02:00.000Z	hendrixski	jenn	he gets the blue screen of "your xserver has crashed"  that is shortly after I installed VMWare for him
2007-03-20T12:03:00.000Z	hendrixski	jenn	 just blank prompt, or does it actually have something meaningful like "log in"
2007-03-20T12:04:00.000Z	jenn	hendrixski	a black screen with login command prompt. I'm able to login thru that.
2007-03-20T12:04:00.000Z	hendrixski	jenn	Oh.. you probably changed your xorg.conf file recently
2007-03-20T12:05:00.000Z	jenn	hendrixski	I have never used ubuntu before. This is what I get ever since I install it on my computer two days ago.
2007-03-20T12:06:00.000Z	hendrixski	jenn	oh.  even from the first time you installed it?
2007-03-20T12:06:00.000Z	hendrixski	jenn	after you log in, try the command "startx"
2007-03-20T12:06:00.000Z	jenn	hendrixski	yes that is correct.
2007-03-20T12:08:00.000Z	hendrixski	jenn	so either your driver isn't working, or you have installed the server edition
2007-03-20T12:09:00.000Z	jenn	hendrixski	I can assure you that it's not the server edition. :)
2007-03-20T12:09:00.000Z	hendrixski	jenn	 the driver you can get from nVidias website.. which you can access through a command line browser like lynx
2007-03-20T12:09:00.000Z	jenn	hendrixski	I would love to get the correct drivers installed but don't know where to start.
2007-03-20T12:10:00.000Z	hendrixski	jenn	sudo apt-get install links and then links nvidia.com or something... and find the one for your model
2007-03-20T12:10:00.000Z	jenn	hendrixski	how do I use that command prompt to install them after putting them on CD.
2007-03-20T12:10:00.000Z	hendrixski	jenn	you dont need to put them on a CD
2007-03-20T12:11:00.000Z	hendrixski	jenn	you can download them straight from the website and install
2007-03-20T12:13:00.000Z	hendrixski	jenn	you may also get some help on the Ubuntu Forums, if you post the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf
