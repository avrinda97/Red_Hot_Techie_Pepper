2005-05-13T08:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		arent we all on polyaudio now
2005-05-13T08:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		gnome has to use esd
2005-05-13T08:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		because esd is like higher level alsa
2005-05-13T08:35:00.000Z	spartacus	mebaran151	so there's no way to make them play nice?
2005-05-13T08:37:00.000Z	mebaran151	spartacus	gnome on my system is decent
2005-05-14T07:11:00.000Z	spartacus	mebaran151	sometimes cups offers a device that doesn't seem real... eg usb printers
2005-05-14T07:13:00.000Z	mebaran151	spartacus	it is a usb printer
2005-05-14T07:13:00.000Z	spartacus	mebaran151	that is the cups uri?
2005-05-14T07:26:00.000Z	spartacus	mebaran151	it's talking to the wrong device
2005-05-14T07:27:00.000Z	spartacus	mebaran151	the literal name it's giving you is virtual. you'll want to change it to /dev/usb/lp0
2005-05-14T07:31:00.000Z	spartacus	mebaran151	yah, i usually use the web intereface... but ymmv
2005-05-14T07:35:00.000Z	spartacus	mebaran151	make sure it's enabled in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
2005-05-14T07:35:00.000Z	spartacus	mebaran151	or you can edit /etc/cups/printers.conf
2005-05-14T07:35:00.000Z	spartacus	mebaran151	prolly wants something like DeviceURI usb:/dev/usb/lp0
2005-05-14T07:40:00.000Z	spartacus	mebaran151	no clue about that. i just send cups to the actual printer device. i had issues with my one disconnecting at odd times
2005-05-14T07:42:00.000Z	spartacus	mebaran151	can you paste again
2005-05-14T07:43:00.000Z	mebaran151	spartacus	I want YOURS!
2005-05-14T07:44:00.000Z	spartacus	mebaran151	can you paste your file?
2005-05-14T07:47:00.000Z	spartacus	mebaran151	i've pasted it now
2005-05-14T07:52:00.000Z	spartacus	mebaran151	ya?
2005-05-14T08:01:00.000Z	spartacus	mebaran151	i'm not sure why it would say that
