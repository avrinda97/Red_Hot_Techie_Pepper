2008-10-28T11:25:00.000Z	genesismachine		I've just installed 8.10 on a macbook (2,1) and the keyboard is all messed up. What used to be keys 108 and 116 are now something else - 108 is the down arrow, not sure about 116. I now have no down arrow button. However, I know that X is detecting it correctly since in the gdm login screen, the arrow works fine... So it's something in my user profile
2008-10-28T11:25:00.000Z	genesismachine		Any ideas on what it is in my user profile that's messing things up?
2008-10-28T11:26:00.000Z	genesismachine		#ubuntu+1 ?
2008-10-28T11:26:00.000Z	Frogzoo	genesismachine	do you have a ~.xmodmap ? or .xkeymap?
2008-10-28T11:27:00.000Z	Frogzoo	genesismachine	after d/ling xmodmap, logout & back in
2008-10-28T11:29:00.000Z	genesismachine	Frogzoo	What do you mean downloading xmodmap?
2008-10-28T11:30:00.000Z	Frogzoo	genesismachine	deleting
2008-10-28T11:30:00.000Z	genesismachine	Frogzoo	It's not a separate package now, it's installed with xserver-utils, which I'm not sure that I can delete...
2008-10-28T11:31:00.000Z	Frogzoo	genesismachine	I mean in your home directory - does ls  ~/.x* show anything?
2008-10-28T11:31:00.000Z	genesismachine	Frogzoo	but even if I could delete it, I don't want to since I want to eventually get the right click mapped to the right apple key like it was before...
2008-10-28T11:31:00.000Z	genesismachine	Frogzoo	oh, you mean delete the .xmodmap file? ok, will do
2008-10-28T11:31:00.000Z	Frogzoo	genesismachine	don't delete - just rename
2008-10-28T11:32:00.000Z	genesismachine	Frogzoo	Do I need to restart X, or can I just type in a command to update the settings?
2008-10-28T11:32:00.000Z	Frogzoo	genesismachine	restart X
2008-10-28T11:34:00.000Z	genesismachine	Frogzoo	Same thing as before
2008-10-28T11:34:00.000Z	Frogzoo	genesismachine	dunno - try preferences -> keyboard layout
2008-10-28T11:35:00.000Z	genesismachine	Frogzoo	I've tried apple, apple laptop, apple laptop international, macbook/macbook pro and  all sorts of stuff, they all have the same results
2008-10-28T11:36:00.000Z	genesismachine	Frogzoo	I'm going to try the other layouts again, brb
2008-10-28T11:40:00.000Z	genesismachine	Frogzoo	No effect :( The apple laptop layouts are all the same
2008-10-28T11:43:00.000Z	Frogzoo	genesismachine	dunno, maybe try google
2008-10-28T11:43:00.000Z	genesismachine	Frogzoo	tried, with no success... This was my last-ditch attempt...
2008-10-28T11:44:00.000Z	Frogzoo	genesismachine	I don't believe it's only you with this problem
