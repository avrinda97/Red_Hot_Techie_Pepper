2011-06-09T07:03:00.000Z	dooglus		can I find a complete list of the packages that are installed by default?
2011-06-09T07:03:00.000Z	edbian	dooglus	dpkg -l
2011-06-09T07:03:00.000Z	edbian	dooglus	what was it?
2011-06-09T07:03:00.000Z	dooglus	edbian	that's what I'd like to know
2011-06-09T07:03:00.000Z	dooglus	edbian	my desktop wallpaper has stopped redrawing itself
2011-06-09T07:04:00.000Z	dooglus	edbian	I thought that so long as I kept ubuntu-minimal and ubuntu-desktop installed, they would make sure everything I needed was kept, due to their dependencies.  but it seems there's more
2011-06-09T07:05:00.000Z	edbian	dooglus	yeah they do.  run nautilus in a terminal
2011-06-09T07:05:00.000Z	dooglus	edbian	I don't think nautilus has a terminal mode
2011-06-09T07:05:00.000Z	edbian	dooglus	?
2011-06-09T07:06:00.000Z	dooglus	edbian	if I type 'nautilus' in a terminal, it opens its own window
2011-06-09T07:06:00.000Z	edbian	dooglus	Did it also re-draw the background?
2011-06-09T07:07:00.000Z	dooglus	edbian	I don't use nautilus ever - I don't know what usually draws the desktop for me; I use xfce4
2011-06-09T07:07:00.000Z	edbian	dooglus	Ahhh,  In gnome, nautilus draws the background.  Hang on
2011-06-09T07:07:00.000Z	dooglus	edbian	xfdesktop is running
2011-06-09T07:07:00.000Z	edbian	dooglus	That would have been my guess :P
2011-06-09T07:08:00.000Z	dooglus	edbian	but that's beside the point - if I've removed one package I needed, I may well have removed more too
2011-06-09T07:08:00.000Z	dooglus	edbian	and so I'd like a complete list of what's originally installed, to diff with my current package list
2011-06-09T07:08:00.000Z	edbian	dooglus	oohhh, a list of default packages installed.  That's gonna be hard.
2011-06-09T07:09:00.000Z	dooglus	edbian	my original aim here was to write docs for how to set up a development environment for a package I'm working on, and I didn't want to have anything non-default installed before I started
2011-06-09T07:09:00.000Z	edbian	dooglus	11.04 ?
2011-06-09T07:09:00.000Z	dooglus	edbian	yes
2011-06-09T07:10:00.000Z	edbian	dooglus	gohdan That's the best way IMO
