2012-03-07T16:49:00.000Z	Pirsch		Hi all. I'm running 11.10. When I put a video on my mp4 player, it doesn't work. If I use Windows 7 to put the file on the mp4 player, it works. I've done the medibuntu thing and have had no luck.
2012-03-07T16:50:00.000Z	edgars	Pirsch	the same video?
2012-03-07T16:50:00.000Z	Pirsch		Yes, same vid
2012-03-07T16:51:00.000Z	Pirsch		In PCLOS I can make it work after installing task-multimedia but I've never had luck with ubuntu
2012-03-07T16:51:00.000Z	Pirsch		The thing is, I want to use ubuntu and only ubuntu
2012-03-07T16:52:00.000Z	edgars	Pirsch	when the player is connected is it shown as a mass storage or somthing else
2012-03-07T16:52:00.000Z	Pirsch		yes
2012-03-07T16:52:00.000Z	edgars	Pirsch	and you can play the video in ubuntu
2012-03-07T16:52:00.000Z	Pirsch		yes
2012-03-07T16:54:00.000Z	Pirsch	edgars	I've tied using other machines but it makes no difference. Something must get lost in the codecs or something. I'm too noobish to figure this one out. :)
2012-03-07T16:54:00.000Z	edgars	Pirsch	it's wierd it is just a file transfer so it should work
2012-03-07T16:54:00.000Z	Pirsch	edgars	yes, that's what I think
2012-03-07T16:55:00.000Z	Pirsch		Believe it or not, I've had this problem for over a year. Been here about 10 times hoping to find an answer
2012-03-07T16:55:00.000Z	Pirsch	edgars	I wish I could just install task-multimedia
2012-03-07T16:55:00.000Z	Pirsch		but that's for PCLOS
2012-03-07T16:57:00.000Z	edgars	Pirsch	what dose it do?
2012-03-07T16:58:00.000Z	Pirsch	edgars	either it will say "Unsupported format" or if it does play it's broken and you cannot even tell what the pic is.
2012-03-07T16:59:00.000Z	Pirsch		It also sounds like a needle being dragged across a record.
2012-03-07T17:00:00.000Z	Pirsch	edgars	I've tried using WinFF to reformat and try different types of formats. No luck
2012-03-07T17:02:00.000Z	edgars	Pirsch	only thing i could find
