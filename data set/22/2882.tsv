2009-02-17T06:07:00.000Z	hlm	fearful	a common mistake is not pressing enter after typing your password into the proper box, so go to the edit setting and see if your password is there
2009-02-17T06:08:00.000Z	fearful	hlm	do I need a server password or connect command?
2009-02-17T06:08:00.000Z	hlm	fearful	no, that is fine left blank
2009-02-17T06:09:00.000Z	fearful	hlm	yea just hitting enter for the pw workd like a charm thanks
2009-02-17T06:09:00.000Z	hlm	fearful	no problem! glad I could help!
2009-02-18T04:34:00.000Z	fearful	hlm	Go to System > Preferences > Sessions
2009-02-18T04:44:00.000Z	fearful	hlm	You have to find the command of execute, and add it to the Sessions where I told you before
2009-02-18T04:44:00.000Z	hlm	fearful	I forgot where you said
2009-02-18T04:45:00.000Z	fearful	hlm	Thats a better suggestion since its a script
