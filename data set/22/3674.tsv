2008-09-06T00:09:00.000Z	SDuensin		sun-java6-bin is making me dead inside.  Has anyone actually made this install on 8.04?
2008-09-06T00:09:00.000Z	jrib	SDuensin	yes.  Pastebin your cause of death
2008-09-06T00:09:00.000Z	SDuensin	jrib	- I can do that!
2008-09-06T00:13:00.000Z	SDuensin	jrib	- Seems a lot of people get the same output I do during install.
2008-09-06T00:15:00.000Z	jrib	SDuensin	http://sadsoftware.blogspot.com/2008/07/installing-jdk-in-openvz-vps.html seems to have an explanation
2008-09-06T00:15:00.000Z	SDuensin	jrib	- I looked at that, but I don't have OpenVZ, nor that beancounter stuff in /proc
2008-09-06T00:18:00.000Z	SDuensin	jrib	- Some of the threads say I'll get this install error if I failed to check the box when the license for Java was displayed.  If that's the case, how on earth do you get another chance?
2008-09-06T00:19:00.000Z	jrib	SDuensin	are you installing in a shell?
2008-09-06T00:19:00.000Z	SDuensin	jrib	- First time, when it got screwed up, was in Symantic.  Now I'm in a shell.  I can do either.
2008-09-06T00:20:00.000Z	jrib	SDuensin	'sudo dpkg --configure -a' doesn't give you the license question?
2008-09-06T00:21:00.000Z	SDuensin	jrib	- Negative.  subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 134
2008-09-06T00:21:00.000Z	jrib	SDuensin	can you purge it?
2008-09-06T00:22:00.000Z	SDuensin	jrib	- Been tere, done that.  Will do ita agian
2008-09-06T00:22:00.000Z	jrib	SDuensin	oh, you're on dapper too?
2008-09-06T00:22:00.000Z	SDuensin	jrib	- Whatever 8.04 is called.  Too many bird to remember.
2008-09-06T00:23:00.000Z	jrib	SDuensin	ah, yeah, the package version confused me
2008-09-06T00:30:00.000Z	SDuensin	jrib	- Purged.  Recommendation on how to reload it?
2008-09-06T00:31:00.000Z	jrib	SDuensin	sudo apt-get install sun-java6-bin
2008-09-06T00:36:00.000Z	SDuensin	jrib	- Amazing!  It's installed!  I *know* I've done that before!
2008-09-06T00:36:00.000Z	SDuensin	jrib	- Thanks!
2008-09-06T00:36:00.000Z	jrib	SDuensin	yeah that happens sometimes :)
2008-09-06T00:36:00.000Z	SDuensin	jrib	- I'm gonna claim the position of the moon changed.  :-)
