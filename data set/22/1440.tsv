2011-01-05T17:14:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		Hi, my gnome panels are behaving irratically, I have my lower gnome panel set to autohide, but sometimes (randomly, I am not sure what causes it), it just comes up and stays there, although the system behaves like the panel is in hiding, so mouse clicks even on the panel are actually going behind to the browser! it is really confusing, can anyone throw some light on this ?
2011-01-05T17:16:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		anyone on gnome panel ?
2011-01-05T17:17:00.000Z	botcity	dhruvasagar	 how often  does it happen ?
2011-01-05T17:17:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	botcity	well the only way I know how to fix it is to restart the system...i've experienced this at least 5 times since yesterday
2011-01-05T17:18:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	botcity	and my system is on almost 24 hours
2011-01-05T17:19:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	botcity	what i've noticed now is that I can click on the panel if I go to extreme bottom of the screen over the panel....
2011-01-05T17:20:00.000Z	botcity	dhruvasagar	 ok can you access the property's from there
2011-01-05T17:20:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	botcity	yes
2011-01-05T17:20:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	botcity	I can deselect autohide
2011-01-05T17:21:00.000Z	botcity	dhruvasagar	 ok do that
2011-01-05T17:21:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	botcity	I did...but I like it as autohiden...it gives me more screen area to use
2011-01-05T17:21:00.000Z	botcity	dhruvasagar	 then re-enable
2011-01-05T17:21:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	botcity	I did but it doesn't fix it
2011-01-05T17:22:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	botcity	what I did now is click on show hide bottons, that is working ok though
2011-01-05T17:22:00.000Z	botcity	dhruvasagar	 ok sometimes its a  fix!
2011-01-05T17:22:00.000Z	botcity	dhruvasagar	 did that fix the problem
2011-01-05T17:23:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	botcity	oh, well I clicked on show hide buttons, showed / hide the panel a few times, then reverted to autohide, it seems to have been fixed now
2011-01-05T17:23:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	botcity	it did fix it, but do you know what causes it ?
2011-01-05T17:24:00.000Z	botcity	dhruvasagar	 well all i can say is its a bug that affects my laptop . must be a bug ! that works for me too
2011-01-05T17:24:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	botcity	hmm ok well the fix is better than restart though :)
2011-01-05T17:24:00.000Z	botcity	dhruvasagar	 well all i can say is its a bug that affects my laptop . must be a bug ! that works for me to
2011-01-05T17:25:00.000Z	botcity	dhruvasagar	 yeah  i know good luck!
