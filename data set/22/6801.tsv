2010-05-13T03:10:00.000Z	drizzt_		wubi have some complications but still safer then direct install
2010-05-13T03:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	even Wubi can  somtimes screw up,  the safest way is a virtual machine.
2010-05-13T03:11:00.000Z	drizzt_	sebsebseb	(s)he will never know about hardware compatibility then
2010-05-13T03:27:00.000Z	drizzt_	sebsebseb	actually manufacturers go to the risk of releasing new firmware for a reason
2010-05-13T03:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	what reason?  Newer is not always better!  and most people have no proper reason to upgrade the bios
2010-05-13T03:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	no he wasn't asking about booting up
2010-05-13T04:37:00.000Z	drizzt_	sebsebseb	why he needs to cd ever?
2010-05-13T04:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	what you on about bootable USB sticks?
2010-05-13T04:43:00.000Z	drizzt_	sebsebseb	I think his network hardware isn't recognized
2010-05-13T04:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	yes ame here
2010-05-13T04:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	yes same here
2010-05-13T04:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	xenon401 uh no.   Debian Stable is rather old yes,  Debian testing no,  that's more up to date than Ubuntu, and Ubuntu tends to be based on that
2010-05-13T04:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	 xenon401  also Debian is bsically Ubuntu, but without the junk features,  yes there are junk features in Ubuntu now days, well at least for some of us properly experienced users
2010-05-13T05:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	oh your someone else that wants to install Ubuntu
2010-05-13T05:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	just been helping one of those
2010-05-13T05:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	uh nevermidn read wrong
2010-05-13T05:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	yes maybe that person should have gone with Wubi really, on the other hand I guess not quite, since they have been using Ubuntu in VMware  first
2010-05-13T06:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	your rather unlikely to get malware whilst running a Linux distro
2010-05-13T06:40:00.000Z	drizzt_	sebsebseb	right, especially downloading magic printer, scanner or display driver from guy who pretends to be developer
2010-05-13T06:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	yes people should get software only from trusted sources
2010-05-13T06:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	I never said it was 100% secure or something like that
2010-06-09T00:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	drizzt_	heh in a way
