2007-01-23T15:11:00.000Z	foutrelis	mwe	really?
2007-01-23T15:11:00.000Z	mwe	foutrelis	yeah
2007-01-23T15:11:00.000Z	foutrelis	mwe	wow
2007-01-23T15:12:00.000Z	mwe	foutrelis	you might be able to use the new apt-get autoclean, though. But that's broken here
2007-01-23T15:13:00.000Z	foutrelis	mwe	could I, for example, use aptitude to remove kubuntu-desktop (and all other packages related to it) while I have installed it with apt-get?
2007-01-23T15:13:00.000Z	mwe	foutrelis	no
2007-01-23T15:14:00.000Z	mwe	foutrelis	it needs to be installed with apt-get
2007-01-23T15:14:00.000Z	foutrelis	mwe	with aptitude you mean
2007-01-23T15:14:00.000Z	mwe	foutrelis	you'd want to use debfoster or deborphan after removing the meta package
2007-01-23T15:14:00.000Z	mwe	foutrelis	yeah installed with aptitude of course
2007-01-23T15:15:00.000Z	foutrelis	mwe	I should start using aptitude I think :)
2007-01-23T15:15:00.000Z	mwe	foutrelis	I find it superiour
2007-01-23T15:16:00.000Z	mwe	foutrelis	you sometimes have to spend some time telling it you want to keep some stuff it might want to remove, though
2007-01-23T15:16:00.000Z	foutrelis	mwe	so it is kind of double edge knife :)
2007-01-23T15:16:00.000Z	mwe	foutrelis	it can be easily done in the ncurses interface you get to when you type just sudo aptitude
2007-01-23T15:17:00.000Z	mwe	foutrelis	I use aptitude whenever I can
2007-01-23T15:18:00.000Z	mwe	foutrelis	You will probably be annoyed be the interface the first time you use it
2007-01-23T15:18:00.000Z	foutrelis	mwe	I have used it before ;)
2007-01-23T15:18:00.000Z	mwe	foutrelis	oh ;)
2007-01-23T15:18:00.000Z	foutrelis	mwe	I don't find it easy to navigate to the package I want, but that's why we can search :P
2007-01-23T15:19:00.000Z	mwe	foutrelis	yeah. it could need some polishing
2007-01-23T15:23:00.000Z	mwe	foutrelis	I think the pros of using aptitude outweighs the cons, though
