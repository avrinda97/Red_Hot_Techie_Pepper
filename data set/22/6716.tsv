2006-08-15T13:50:00.000Z	StreetSmart		Hey guys. Im wondering if there is anything wrong with apt-get on my system. I just installed 6.06.1 and did the apt-get upgrade but there doesnt seem to be anything to upgrade is this correct?
2006-08-15T13:51:00.000Z	Shinzetsu^IRSSI	StreetSmart	It gets the packages really fast, it seems it didnt update but it did :)
2006-08-15T13:52:00.000Z	StreetSmart	Shinzetsu^IRSSI	lol but it told me that 0 packages were ungraded....
2006-08-15T13:52:00.000Z	Shinzetsu^IRSSI	StreetSmart	hmm, did it get the packages though?
2006-08-15T13:52:00.000Z	StreetSmart	Shinzetsu^IRSSI	no.. thats what im saying.
2006-08-15T13:52:00.000Z	Shinzetsu^IRSSI	StreetSmart	like this is list of 'getting package <link>'
2006-08-15T13:53:00.000Z	Shinzetsu^IRSSI	StreetSmart	try and enable universe and multiverse in synaptic advanced options, maybe itll work then
