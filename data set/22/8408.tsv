2005-08-30T12:35:00.000Z	fluffybunny_		thanks - it works now :)
2005-08-30T09:00:00.000Z	fluffybunny_		i seem to be having issues with sound -->  every mp3 or other sound file I play (using XMMS) seems to be distorted (you know like the sound you get when the volume is too loud?) --> how do I fix this?
2005-08-30T09:00:00.000Z	brenner	fluffybunny_	lower your volumes
2005-08-30T09:01:00.000Z	fluffybunny_	brenner	and webtoe: that doesn't seem to help?
2005-08-30T09:02:00.000Z	brenner	fluffybunny_	what output plugin you using?
2005-08-30T09:03:00.000Z	fluffybunny_	brenner	and Poromies : uhm.. noob here... how do I (a) check what output plugin I'm using, and/or adjust alsamixer?
2005-08-30T09:03:00.000Z	brenner	fluffybunny_	for the plugin, ctrl+p in xmms, then look in the plugins area, change the output plugin to esound
2005-08-30T09:04:00.000Z	brenner	fluffybunny_	for alsamixer, type alsamixer in a terminal
2005-08-30T09:11:00.000Z	brenner	fluffybunny_	did you try and change the output plugin?
2005-08-30T09:12:00.000Z	fluffybunny_	brenner	yes - I changed to esound output plugin - should i cycle through the other options and see if that helps?
2005-08-30T09:12:00.000Z	brenner	fluffybunny_	no, changing it to anything else probably won't change much
2005-08-30T09:12:00.000Z	brenner	fluffybunny_	er, have you tried any other media players?
2005-08-30T09:12:00.000Z	brenner	fluffybunny_	beep-media-player maybe?
2005-08-30T09:13:00.000Z	fluffybunny_	brenner	well, i've tried media player, but that doesn't work at all - let me download and install beep-media-player and get back to you
2005-08-30T09:14:00.000Z	brenner	fluffybunny_	need to change the output plugin to esound in bmp
2005-08-30T09:14:00.000Z	fluffybunny_	brenner	ok, will do
2005-08-30T09:22:00.000Z	fluffybunny_	brenner	installed beep-media-player. sounds great when I use the ALSA output plugin, sound sucks (same as XMMS) when I use esound...
2005-08-30T09:22:00.000Z	brenner	fluffybunny_	but alsa's ok?
2005-08-30T09:23:00.000Z	fluffybunny_	brenner	alsa's great (on beep-media-player) --> all the output plugins for XMMS suck
2005-08-30T09:24:00.000Z	brenner	fluffybunny_	interesing, but anyway, you've got sound now :)
2005-08-30T09:24:00.000Z	fluffybunny_	brenner	pity, cause I had heard that XMMS was "the best".. oh well, thanks for the help :)
2005-08-30T09:25:00.000Z	brenner	fluffybunny_	no probs
