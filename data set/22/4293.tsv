2009-04-25T12:35:00.000Z	nascentmind		hi. in ubuntu 9.04 when i click on taskbar it takes some time to register the click. why is that? i am using kde.
2009-04-25T12:35:00.000Z	ziroday	nascentmind	#kubuntu is probably best
2009-04-25T12:36:00.000Z	nascentmind	ziroday	ok
2009-05-20T21:14:00.000Z	ziroday	nascentmind	run them in a terminal, and try to catch the error message
2009-05-20T21:15:00.000Z	nascentmind	ziroday	it crashes and says that even though the frontend has crashed the backend will be running.
2009-05-20T21:16:00.000Z	nascentmind	ziroday	is there any progress with the free ati drivers? When is the complete version going to be released?
2009-05-20T21:16:00.000Z	ziroday	nascentmind	what card? and what version of ubuntu?
2009-05-20T21:16:00.000Z	nascentmind	ziroday	ati radeon hd4670 and jaunty
2009-05-20T21:19:00.000Z	ziroday	nascentmind	sorry I got distracted, yes the closed and open source drivers should both work for that card. Let me doublecheck
2009-05-20T21:19:00.000Z	nascentmind	ziroday	it works alright but not 3d i guess.. is there any way i can check whats the progress on the card drivers?
2009-05-20T21:21:00.000Z	ziroday	nascentmind	okay, the closed source drivers support that card, and the open source drivers have experimental 3D support for that card
2009-05-20T21:22:00.000Z	nascentmind	ziroday	how are you checking it?
2009-05-20T21:22:00.000Z	ziroday	nascentmind	http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/driver/xf86-video-radeonhd/plain/README
2009-05-20T21:27:00.000Z	nascentmind	ziroday	thanks.
2009-05-20T21:27:00.000Z	nascentmind	ziroday	any chances of installing a dbg version of jockey or envy?
2009-05-20T21:28:00.000Z	ziroday	nascentmind	err which driver do you want to use, fglrx or radeonhd?
2009-05-20T21:28:00.000Z	nascentmind	ziroday	fglrx.. but then i will revert to radeonhd as it looks way stable and better.
2009-05-20T21:29:00.000Z	ziroday	nascentmind	err okay. To install the fglrx drivers do sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
2009-05-20T21:32:00.000Z	nascentmind	ziroday	i am following this elaborate ritual http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Jaunty_Installation_Guide
2009-05-20T21:34:00.000Z	ziroday	nascentmind	I'm sorry I have to go now :)
