2009-05-22T11:00:00.000Z	zenxr		Soren: just manually edit the grub.config file -.-
2009-05-22T11:01:00.000Z	zenxr		Captain: hit me
2009-05-22T11:01:00.000Z	zenxr		what's the issue?
2009-05-22T11:01:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	zenxr	I just went through the installation for jaunty .. all was well. But, upon reboot, I get a GRUB error "Error 2"
2009-05-22T11:02:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	zenxr	I have three drives - 1 IDE (boot) and 2 SATA drives (data)
2009-05-22T11:04:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	zenxr	how do I fix it? I expect that I'll need to edit the GRUB files
2009-05-22T11:04:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	zenxr	filesystems - I can't tell
2009-05-22T11:06:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	zenxr	Can I edit the GRUB file or something myself? I'm using the alternate CD
2009-05-22T11:08:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	zenxr	I don't get to a command prompt
2009-05-22T11:08:00.000Z	zenxr	Captain_Haddock	what do you mean?
2009-05-22T11:09:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	zenxr	rephrase: How do I access my installed partition with the alternate CD?
2009-05-22T11:09:00.000Z	zenxr	Captain_Haddock	Ah, one second I have it written somewhere

2009-05-22T11:11:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	zenxr	I unfortunately don't have a live CD :( I'm using the alternate CD
2009-05-22T11:11:00.000Z	zenxr	Captain_Haddock	what the heck is an alternate CD?
2009-05-22T11:12:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	zenxr	the text based installation CD
2009-05-22T11:12:00.000Z	zenxr	Captain_Haddock	sorry I should have known
2009-05-22T11:12:00.000Z	zenxr	Captain_Haddock	you cannot get any command line that does standard linux commands?
2009-05-22T11:13:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	zenxr	I don't know... I get the grub error as soon as I boot up
2009-05-22T11:13:00.000Z	zenxr	Captain_Haddock	you are aware that whenever grub boots you can edit it before you select a partition to load?
2009-05-22T11:14:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	zenxr	I don't get to the select option page.. I just get "Grub 1.5 loading ..." (or similar) and then "error 2" :(
2009-05-22T11:15:00.000Z	zenxr	Captain_Haddock	Sorry, I thought the issue was with an already installed partition. You have a problem with your CD; I don't think that's fixable and you may need to download it again
