2006-06-05T06:24:00.000Z	kane77		what is the executable for search (beagle)?? or how can I add shortcut to it??
2006-06-05T06:25:00.000Z	ynef	kane77	"beagle" is the executable's name. What desktop environment are you using?
2006-06-05T06:26:00.000Z	ynef	kane77	then I can't help you, but I suppose that the terminology is "launcher" or something
2006-06-05T06:26:00.000Z	kane77	ynef	and trying to execute beagle it says that "bash: beagle: command not found"
2006-06-05T06:27:00.000Z	ynef	kane77	interesting -- you do have it installed, right?
2006-06-05T06:28:00.000Z	kane77	ynef	yes... when I run Places->Search it runs a beagle search... but when I try to add a button to pannel "Search for files" it only gives me the old search...
2006-06-05T06:30:00.000Z	ynef	kane77	looking at the file list, it seems that beagle might be started with the command "beagle-search" -- one of many files installed into /usr/bin that start with "beagle"
2006-06-05T06:31:00.000Z	kane77	ynef	yes that's it... many thanx...
2006-06-05T06:34:00.000Z	ynef	kane77	it's the drivers you use to get OpenGL in Linux on Nvidia cards -- that it killed 3D for you doesn't seem right at all
2006-06-05T06:34:00.000Z	kane77	ynef	I believe I need legacy drivers I have ancient TNT2
2006-06-05T06:35:00.000Z	ynef	kane77	ah, yes, you do -- TNT2 is too old to be supported by the newer drivers AFAIK
2006-06-05T06:35:00.000Z	kane77	ynef	how can I install them?
2006-06-05T06:36:00.000Z	ynef	kane77	install "nvidia-glx-legacy" instead ;)
2006-06-05T06:37:00.000Z	kane77	ynef	that sounds logical :)) why don't I ever come up with it... :D
2006-06-05T06:40:00.000Z	ynef	kane77	post the file somewhere and tell us what OS you want to boot per default
2006-06-05T06:40:00.000Z	ynef	kane77	or that ;)
2006-06-05T06:46:00.000Z	kane77	ynef	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15128 that's the paste of /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-06-05T06:47:00.000Z	kane77	ynef	and I want to change the default boot to windows... (you know i share this PC with dad and he gets mad when he turns on comp and the windows doesn't start up..)
2006-06-05T06:49:00.000Z	ynef	kane77	change the default to 5 -- if that's wrong, then to 6... don't know if the "other operating systems" line counts as one, so experiment :)
2006-06-05T06:49:00.000Z	kane77	ynef	ok I will... RESTARTING....
2006-06-05T09:07:00.000Z	ynef	kane77	sup?
2006-06-05T09:09:00.000Z	ynef	kane77	sure, grub can use images and stuff... look it up on the internet
