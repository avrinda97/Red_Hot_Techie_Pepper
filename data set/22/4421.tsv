2008-07-17T02:55:00.000Z	_xyz		help: after a fresh installation of 8.04 I have no more taskbar visible at the top of screen, only desktop.
2008-07-17T02:56:00.000Z	_xyz		nope
2008-07-17T02:56:00.000Z	_xyz		all i did was install all the newest updates + nvidia drivers and uninstalled Evolution (cause i don't need it)
2008-07-17T02:57:00.000Z	_xyz		sebNaitsabes: im using a strange setup where the Ubuntu is on an IDE HDD and has the grub loader and WinXP is on a Sata HDD
2008-07-17T02:57:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	_xyz	does it appear if you try to move your mouse off the top of the screen?
2008-07-17T02:57:00.000Z	_xyz		seven_six_two: no
2008-07-17T02:58:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	_xyz	I've had a similar problem, but it was because I ended up with a large virtual desktop
2008-07-17T02:58:00.000Z	_xyz		sebNaitsabes: if it's an nvidia driver problem, how do I fix it?
2008-07-17T02:58:00.000Z	_xyz		seven_six_two: i don't think i set up anything like that
2008-07-17T02:59:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	_xyz	I didn't either. It was an upgrade that didn't do my xorg.conf properly
2008-07-17T02:59:00.000Z	_xyz		seven_six_two: how did your resolve that then?
2008-07-17T03:00:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	_xyz	I used    sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-07-17T03:00:00.000Z	_xyz		seven_six_two: and how did you kown that the problem was with xserver?
2008-07-17T03:00:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	_xyz	because everything graphical was out of whack. can you see the icons on your desktop?
2008-07-17T03:01:00.000Z	_xyz		bi
2008-07-17T03:01:00.000Z	_xyz		no
2008-07-17T03:02:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	_xyz	I don't use gnome, but can you right click on your desktop to run a command?
2008-07-17T03:02:00.000Z	_xyz	Seven_Six_Two	i'll try that then. what's the shortcut for ubuntu cmd line?
2008-07-17T03:02:00.000Z	_xyz		no
2008-07-17T03:02:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	_xyz	try alt-f2 and run gnome-panel
2008-07-17T03:02:00.000Z	_xyz		ok
2008-07-17T03:15:00.000Z	_xyz	Seven_Six_Two	I went into root shell interface, typed in the command, went through a bunch of menus (mostly about keyboard layout?), rebooted, same thing
