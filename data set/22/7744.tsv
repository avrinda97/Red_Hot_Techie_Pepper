2008-04-28T22:59:00.000Z	lesshaste		looks like hardy upgrading is pretty fatal :)_
2008-04-28T22:59:00.000Z	lesshaste		:)
2008-04-28T22:59:00.000Z	jens_	lesshaste	hm... yes... I've got problems with 3D-Accerleration, works before, never worked since then
2008-04-28T23:00:00.000Z	lesshaste	jens_	I have far worse problems :) the new kernel causes hard drive errors!
2008-04-28T23:00:00.000Z	lesshaste	jens_	^^
2008-04-28T23:01:00.000Z	jens_	lesshaste	also fglrx, tried a lot, nothing worked
2008-04-28T23:04:00.000Z	jens_	lesshaste	Have probems with that, too. 2.6.24-amd64 seems to have some kind of deadlock in it
2008-04-28T23:05:00.000Z	lesshaste	jens_	cool ! :) I am on amd64 but am using the 32bit kernel without much luck
2008-04-28T23:06:00.000Z	lesshaste	jens_	check http://pastebin.com/f52736624 out
2008-04-28T23:06:00.000Z	jens_	lesshaste	on a old PC next to me (also upgraded from 7.10) the Kernel seems to be working fine... (but there is really NOTHING that could cause problems :D)
2008-04-28T23:06:00.000Z	lesshaste	jens_	:)
2008-04-28T23:06:00.000Z	lesshaste	jens_	is there a ubuntu blog where we can see them all beavering away to fix the kernel :)
2008-04-28T23:07:00.000Z	jens_	lesshaste	I don't know... but there should be one, it is a mess...
2008-04-28T23:07:00.000Z	lesshaste	jens_	it does seem to be.. which is odd as it was beta tested a lot
2008-04-28T23:08:00.000Z	lesshaste	jens_	I posted my problem.. I'll leave it a couple of days and then maybe try the bug tracking system
2008-04-28T23:08:00.000Z	jens_	lesshaste	good idea, I keep on trying :D
2008-04-28T23:08:00.000Z	lesshaste	jens_	good luck :)
2008-04-28T23:08:00.000Z	lesshaste	jens_	we need to split this channel though
2008-04-28T23:09:00.000Z	jens_	lesshaste	indeed...
2008-04-28T23:09:00.000Z	lesshaste	jens_	to put people with similar problems in the same place
2008-04-28T23:09:00.000Z	lesshaste	jens_	who is in charge? :)
2008-04-28T23:09:00.000Z	jens_	lesshaste	I am not :D but don't know who is...
