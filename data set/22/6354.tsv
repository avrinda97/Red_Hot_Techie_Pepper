2007-10-20T03:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ekp	No, you might try grabbing the sane *source* package from debian since that worked and compile it on Ubuntu
2007-10-20T03:29:00.000Z	ekp	Jordan_U	does 7.10 have the tools or do I need to download them
2007-10-20T03:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ekp	You will need to install the package "build-essential" and use apt-get build-dep, do you already know how to recompile a debian source package?
