2009-08-29T03:28:00.000Z	MindVirus	cablguy	I'm removing packages that have been uninstalled but still have configuration files.
2009-08-29T03:28:00.000Z	MindVirus	cablguy	gtkorphan is a program that finds all orphaned packages.
2009-08-29T03:28:00.000Z	MindVirus	cablguy	an orphaned package is a package without a parent -- that means it isn't a dependency.

2009-08-29T03:30:00.000Z	MindVirus	cablguy	Skype is closed-source software. We don't like that kind.
2009-08-29T03:31:00.000Z	MindVirus	cablguy	just curious, do you know how to tab-complete?
2009-08-29T03:32:00.000Z	MindVirus	cablguy	check this out. Type the first few letters of my name and press tab.
2009-08-29T03:33:00.000Z	cablguy	MindVirus	 yes, I've know about that for a while..
2009-08-29T03:33:00.000Z	MindVirus	cablguy	OK. That's tab completion. You can do that in the terminal too.
2009-08-29T03:33:00.000Z	MindVirus	cablguy	I figure you're a new Ubuntu user so you might be interested.
