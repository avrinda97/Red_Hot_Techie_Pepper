2007-02-09T17:56:00.000Z	Tom_		I've been searching around the net. Different distros, different versions, different applications -- nothing that's exactly what I'm after.
2007-02-09T06:01:00.000Z	Tom_		<Flannel> Tom_: each distro is just a default application thing (well, ontop of the package management and stuff), you can install whatever you want on them. <-- I'm talking about the installer, not the installed OS.
2007-02-09T06:01:00.000Z	Tom_		My S-ATA array is my *only* drive.
2007-02-09T06:01:00.000Z	Tom_		When you install, for instance, XP
2007-02-09T06:01:00.000Z	Tom_		It prompts you to press F6 to install third-party RAID or SCSI drivers.
2007-02-09T06:02:00.000Z	Tom_		I have to do that for my Sil3112A RAID (on-board) controller, so that my HDDs can be seen as an array.
2007-02-09T06:03:00.000Z	Tom_		Ubuntu 6.10 doesn't give this option, but does see the drives -- sadly not as an array, just as single drives.
2007-02-09T06:03:00.000Z	Tom_		GUI-ish boot menu.
2007-02-09T06:04:00.000Z	Tom_		Installation is all text.
2007-02-09T06:04:00.000Z	Tom_		The Partitioner seemed pretty basic :/
2007-02-09T06:04:00.000Z	Byan	Tom_	do you want to use software RAID or RAID on the card?
2007-02-09T06:06:00.000Z	Byan	Tom_	no, that is for you...
2007-02-09T06:07:00.000Z	Byan	Tom_	it's for people not using software RAID
2007-02-09T06:09:00.000Z	Byan	Tom_	hmmm it should give you a start though
2007-02-09T06:09:00.000Z	Byan	Tom_	you need to mount that on the live CD
2007-02-09T06:10:00.000Z	Byan	Tom_	/me shrugs doens't matter
2007-02-09T06:14:00.000Z	Tom_	Byan	After reading, I'm still skeptical that this would work for installing. Yes, it appears that it would allow me to mount the drive via dmraid. But how do I install programs, when I'm booting from a live CD? Where would they be 'installed'? RAM?
2007-02-09T06:14:00.000Z	Byan	Tom_	yeah, see, I'm not sure....
2007-02-09T06:16:00.000Z	Byan	Tom_	well, you should be able to do it without doing that...
2007-02-09T06:18:00.000Z	Byan	Tom_	if I were you, i'd just try and install it that way..? what do you have to loose?
2007-02-09T06:20:00.000Z	Byan	Tom_	I'm no expert.. but if that does work.. then they'd just be installed on a fake partition.. RAM disk or otherwise
2007-02-09T06:35:00.000Z	Tom_	Byan	Now *this* is more like it :) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto
