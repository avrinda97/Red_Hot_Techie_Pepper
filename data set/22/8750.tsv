2005-05-27T09:17:00.000Z	|JE55E|		The dialup works fine in windows, but I really want to go to ubuntu. This is proving to be an impossible limitation.
2005-05-27T09:18:00.000Z	|JE55E|		Just in case anyone is confused. I am NOT on AOL, normal PAP isp.
2005-05-27T09:18:00.000Z	nickrud	|JE55E|	if dialup works in windows, it will work in ubuntu

2005-05-27T09:18:00.000Z	nickrud	|JE55E|	I jumped int late so, can I help
2005-05-27T09:20:00.000Z	|JE55E|	nickrud	I get errors in /var/log/messages and modem hangs up.
2005-05-27T09:20:00.000Z	nickrud	|JE55E|	did you use pppconfig to enable ppp?
2005-05-27T09:21:00.000Z	nickrud	|JE55E|	paste in pastebin.com lspci
2005-05-27T09:23:00.000Z	|JE55E|	nickrud	what is pastebin.com?

2005-05-27T09:24:00.000Z	nickrud	|JE55E|	without annoying the other people on this channel
2005-05-27T09:30:00.000Z	|JE55E|	nickrud	sorry ubuntu system just crashed. restarting now and will post in pastebin "lspci -vv" under name JE55E
2005-05-27T09:31:00.000Z	nickrud	|JE55E|	after you paste it there will be an address yo can give me
2005-05-27T09:37:00.000Z	|JE55E|	nickrud	heres the problem in pastebin http://pastebin.com/286819
2005-05-27T09:37:00.000Z	|JE55E|	nickrud	let me know if that works. and I will next paste the hardware
2005-05-27T09:39:00.000Z	nickrud	|JE55E|	I'll be honest, I've never seen that sequence.
2005-05-27T09:43:00.000Z	|JE55E|	nickrud	my isp is iiNet in Australia. However, I have also tried connecting to a windows RAS server, and get the exact same error
2005-05-27T09:46:00.000Z	nickrud	|JE55E|	ok, this is a bit bigger than I can chew, pppconfig has never failed me, (US), so, hang in there, ask again.
2005-05-27T09:47:00.000Z	|JE55E|	nickrud	heres the lspci in pastebin http://pastebin.com/286828
2005-05-27T09:49:00.000Z	nickrud	|JE55E|	I'm reading your log as a modem that is actually working, and the lspci was to look for a winmodem that doesn't. Like I said, ask for more competent help
2005-05-27T09:50:00.000Z	|JE55E|	nickrud	Thanks for trying :-/
2005-05-27T09:50:00.000Z	nickrud	|JE55E|	I shoot for 60%
