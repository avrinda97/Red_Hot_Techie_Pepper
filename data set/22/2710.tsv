2009-03-27T08:37:00.000Z	JustinNFX		I don't underestand because the ATI card is actually better with graffics then my brand new intel card on my lappy which works fine with ubuntu
2009-03-27T08:39:00.000Z	JustinNFX		So, if I were to buy another video card (under $100) if i were to play it safe go with a semi-new Nvida.
2009-03-27T08:39:00.000Z	JustinNFX		Nvida seems to have a love relationship with ubuntu.
2009-03-27T08:40:00.000Z	JustinNFX		Anybody recommend a economic but efficient card for use with ubuntu and the upcomming distros?
2009-03-27T08:40:00.000Z	JustinNFX		tritum: sorry, yeah released like the next one
2009-03-27T08:40:00.000Z	JustinNFX		releases*
2009-03-27T08:41:00.000Z	JustinNFX		this keyboard is horrible if i type too fast menus pop up that prevent me from typing
2009-03-27T08:42:00.000Z	JustinNFX		So, I know there are some geekz out there what it is a semi decent GPU Card to buy?
2009-03-27T08:42:00.000Z	JustinNFX		green: no my cpu fan haas actually slowed down believe it or not nice and quiet
2009-03-27T08:43:00.000Z	JustinNFX		I love newegg
2009-03-27T08:43:00.000Z	kravlin	JustinNFX	Agreed.
2009-03-27T08:46:00.000Z	kravlin	JustinNFX	First, put the person you're talking to in the message. most IRC clients highlight the message for that user then. Second, I've got no idea then. Sorry.
2009-03-27T08:49:00.000Z	kravlin	JustinNFX	Ubuntu doesn't make mythTV. It's another group that makes Myth for all platforms.
2009-03-27T08:50:00.000Z	JustinNFX	kravlin	if you would like to explain how to put person you're talking to in the message i will do it (it been 8 years since I used IRC)
2009-03-27T08:51:00.000Z	JustinNFX	kravlin	I mean that they make a version of ubuntu i am sorry I did not make it more clear
2009-03-27T08:52:00.000Z	kravlin	JustinNFX	got both. I'm not trying to be hostle. Sorry if i came off that way.
2009-03-27T08:53:00.000Z	JustinNFX	kravlin	how do you directly speak to the user your chatting to its been atleast 7 years since i used mIRC
2009-03-27T08:54:00.000Z	kravlin	JustinNFX	if you just put their name in like you have it'll highlight what you said to them in most clients. that way it's easier to have a conversation going on.
2009-03-27T08:56:00.000Z	JustinNFX	kravlin	so, i was doing it right you the person name then this symbol " : "
2009-03-27T08:57:00.000Z	JustinNFX	kravlin	Through synaptic I installed Zend for PHP and a Ruby Framework plus ruby IDE, and the files are no where to be seen, any idea
2009-03-27T08:59:00.000Z	kravlin	JustinNFX	i'm pretty much as clueless as you. I just started really using linux this last year because it was easier to log into my College's computers with it. I'm still learning things all the time.
2009-03-27T09:01:00.000Z	kravlin	JustinNFX	no, everyone can see them. However, we get it in red, or blue or some other shiny color. It shows our names.
