2005-02-05T14:35:00.000Z	defile		I've got a question about warty
2005-02-05T14:36:00.000Z	defile		I've just tried the live CD, and it has Firefox 0.9.x, it 1.0 available for it?
2005-02-05T14:37:00.000Z	defile		ugh
2005-02-05T14:37:00.000Z	defile		so I'd have to snarf it from Hoary?
2005-02-05T14:37:00.000Z	tritium	defile	yes, but the 0.9 version in Warty is hardly different from 1.0
2005-02-05T14:37:00.000Z	defile	tritium	okay
2005-02-05T14:39:00.000Z	tritium	defile	that's not hard, and it's documented well on ubuntuguide.org and wiki
2005-02-05T14:39:00.000Z	defile	tritium	good links, thanks
2005-02-05T14:42:00.000Z	tritium	defile	but the last time I used slackware was 1994 ;)
2005-02-05T14:43:00.000Z	defile	tritium	it has changed a lot since then (other than it's still being mostly run by one person)
2005-02-05T14:43:00.000Z	tritium	defile	I can imagine.  10 years is a long time
2005-02-05T14:44:00.000Z	defile	tritium	I'm pretty sure I can revert to what I had before if I decide to go through with this and Ubuntu doesn't float my boat ;-)
2005-02-05T14:44:00.000Z	tritium	defile	what's your root filesystem on slack?  you could resize it, possibly, and dual-boot
2005-02-05T14:44:00.000Z	defile	tritium	I'd rather not, but it's ext3
2005-02-05T14:45:00.000Z	tritium	defile	okay.  it would be possible, though.  Just trying to think of options for you
2005-02-05T14:45:00.000Z	defile	tritium	I have one 20 GB fs that I have for my music and backups
2005-02-05T14:53:00.000Z	defile	tritium	thank you for that ubuntuguide.org link, it answers a lot of my DFQ's ;-)
2005-02-06T14:53:00.000Z	tritium	defile	meaning?
2005-02-06T14:55:00.000Z	tritium	defile	what boat are we in together?
2005-02-06T14:56:00.000Z	defile	tritium	not being able to make much sense out of J-jayz-Z
2005-02-06T14:57:00.000Z	tritium	defile	oh...hadn't noticed
2005-02-13T13:35:00.000Z	tritium	defile	nor is mine
