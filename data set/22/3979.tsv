2008-04-21T17:58:00.000Z	slowlearner	jeffimperial	quick question, did the bios recognize your drive?
2008-04-21T17:59:00.000Z	jeffimperial	slowlearner	got it there now, man. sorry.. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/63915/ ...yep, the bios had it right..
2008-04-21T18:02:00.000Z	slowlearner	jeffimperial	weird, i don't see any attempt to recognize another drive, it's as if the drive isn't connected
2008-04-21T18:04:00.000Z	slowlearner	jeffimperial	can you reboot? make sure the bios recognizes your drive first :)
