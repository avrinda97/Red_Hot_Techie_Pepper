2006-10-23T12:59:00.000Z	PSUSI		how do X applications resolve color names like "black" is #000000?  since upgrading to dapper a number of my X apps are broken because they can't resolve the names

2006-10-23T13:01:00.000Z	PSUSI	LjL	thanks
2006-10-23T13:16:00.000Z	PSUSI	LjL	hrm... I don't seem to have the rgb.dir and .pag binary versions... could that be my problem?
2006-10-23T13:18:00.000Z	LjL	PSUSI	let me see if i have those
2006-10-23T13:18:00.000Z	PSUSI	LjL	that link you gave me said xrgb is normally used to convert the text file into a binary one... I have the text file and it does define black... but no binary version
2006-10-23T13:18:00.000Z	LjL	PSUSI	i have the .txt but not the .pag. i am on Edgy
2006-10-23T13:19:00.000Z	LjL	PSUSI	an example of a program that complains about that?
2006-10-23T13:19:00.000Z	PSUSI	LjL	emacs and gitk
2006-10-23T13:19:00.000Z	PSUSI	LjL	funny thing is my system at home ran dapper throughout the development process and is nwo on edgy... never had this problem... I upgrade this server at work and this happens...
2006-10-23T13:21:00.000Z	LjL	PSUSI	hm, hold on a second, i'm trying to install gitk but apparently my repositories are down right now
2006-10-23T13:21:00.000Z	PSUSI	LjL	you got emacs installed?
2006-10-23T13:21:00.000Z	LjL	PSUSI	nope
2006-10-23T13:24:00.000Z	LjL	PSUSI	can you give me a quick hint on how to start/configure gitk? right now it complains it cannot find the .git directory
2006-10-23T13:24:00.000Z	PSUSI	LjL	it is for showing history in a git repository... you need to check one out to inspect ;)
2006-10-23T13:28:00.000Z	LjL	PSUSI	keep in mind he's using Hoary.
2006-10-23T13:29:00.000Z	LjL	PSUSI	i don't know, i started with breezy. and i use KDE anyway :-)
2006-10-23T13:40:00.000Z	PSUSI	LjL	were you able to run emacs or gitk?  if so do you have an RgbPath entry in the Files section of your xorg.conf?  found a thread sugesting that might be the problem... I don't have that entry
2006-10-23T13:41:00.000Z	LjL	PSUSI	no, gitk left me on my own for configuring it, the man page being less than helpful, and emacs... brrr no, i'm not installing it :P
2006-10-23T13:41:00.000Z	PSUSI	LjL	well, do you have an RgbPath entry in your xorg.conf?
2006-10-23T13:46:00.000Z	LjL	PSUSI	no, nothing like that in my xorg.conf
2006-10-23T13:46:00.000Z	PSUSI	LjL	yea... me neither... checked the xorg logs and it says it defaults to /etc/X11/rgb
