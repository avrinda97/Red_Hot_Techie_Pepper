2011-06-03T16:22:00.000Z	BajK		any idea on this panic thing? if I remove the "quiet splash" and that "swap thing" and the payload to "text" on startup then it works just fine
2011-06-03T16:23:00.000Z	BajK		but I dont want to edit the grub config on any start
2011-06-03T16:23:00.000Z	BajK		AND I WNAT PLYMOUTH! :D
2011-06-03T16:23:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	BajK	what video chip?
2011-06-03T16:23:00.000Z	BajK	ActionPa1snip	Intel i915
2011-06-03T16:24:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	BajK	what is the "swap thing"?
2011-06-03T16:24:00.000Z	BajK		but seems the radeon makes problems here
2011-06-03T16:24:00.000Z	BajK	ActionPa1snip	swap.blabla=7 or something mom
2011-06-03T16:24:00.000Z	BajK	ActionPa1snip	vt.handoff=7
2011-06-03T16:25:00.000Z	BajK		!pm | psal_dun
2011-06-03T16:26:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	BajK	not come across that
2011-06-03T16:26:00.000Z	BajK	ActionPa1snip	Me neither but that's what natty brings frequently
2011-06-03T16:26:00.000Z	BajK		restarts are IMPOSSIBLE. then it panics no matter what I do
2011-06-03T16:26:00.000Z	BajK		cold starts work if I remove that handoff thing, the splash and change payload to text
2011-06-03T16:28:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip		!log
2011-06-03T16:31:00.000Z	BajK	ActionPa1snip	seems a problem with the discrete/integrated graphics stuff. When I force the discrete graphics in the bios it works fine (and consumes like 30 Watts -.-)
2011-06-03T16:32:00.000Z	BajK		but there is no option to disable the discrete graphics and use the integrated only (what I do all the time)
2011-06-03T16:34:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	BajK	oh is it one of those dual gpu monstrosities?
2011-06-03T16:34:00.000Z	BajK		yep
2011-06-03T16:35:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	BajK	I've seen bumblebee which can use those. Never used it though
2011-06-03T16:35:00.000Z	BajK		I would not have bought something like that if I knew that 1. hybrid graphics is just a mess in Linux and 2. I would never use it anyway .D
2011-06-03T16:35:00.000Z	BajK	ActionPa1snip	the Intel graphics suits my needs perfectly. blur effect, 3d stuff and all nice effects and useful effects such as window overview work lag-free
