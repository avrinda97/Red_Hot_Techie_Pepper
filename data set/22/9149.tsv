2005-03-21T13:45:00.000Z	missmarple		good morning
2005-03-21T13:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	missmarple	good morning - hope you are as sharp as your namesake today ;-)
2005-03-21T13:47:00.000Z	missmarple	thoreauputic	sure :-D
2005-03-21T13:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	missmarple	I suggest you give a more detailed description of the problem :)
2005-03-21T13:54:00.000Z	missmarple	thoreauputic	well it's gonna be a longer text maybe - but ok ;-)
2005-03-21T13:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	missmarple	a bit at a time
2005-03-21T14:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	missmarple	probably a good idea, since no-one seems to know the answer to your mystery
2005-03-22T08:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	missmarple	what's the trouble?
2005-03-22T08:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	missmarple	power management issue, maybe? I don't know much about it... apm?
2005-03-22T08:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	missmarple	have you tried in grub's menu.lst,   noacpi ? (something like that on the kernel line, from memory)
2005-03-22T08:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	missmarple	I think that's where you disable it, anyway
2005-03-22T08:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	missmarple	if I remember correctly, apm can substitute for some functions
2005-03-22T08:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	missmarple	have you searched the forums? I just found something similar
2005-03-22T08:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	missmarple	are you sure your kernel doesn't have apm? does  sudo modprobe apm fail?
2005-03-22T08:14:00.000Z	missmarple	thoreauputic	wait i'm bootinh
2005-03-22T08:14:00.000Z	missmarple	thoreauputic	modprobe apm fails
2005-03-22T08:15:00.000Z	missmarple	thoreauputic	it says no such device
2005-03-22T08:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	missmarple	hmm
2005-03-22T08:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	missmarple	have you tried rebooting with acpi=off noacpi  ?
2005-03-22T08:16:00.000Z	missmarple	thoreauputic	yep - no change to the problem
2005-03-22T08:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	missmarple	how ghastly ! :(
2005-03-22T08:17:00.000Z	missmarple	thoreauputic	yeah absolutely
