2006-12-26T08:53:00.000Z	SubMOA		opps... turns out, "Ctrl + X" isn't "cut"
2006-12-26T08:54:00.000Z	SubMOA		well I don't want to interrupt anybodies conversation, but can I ask a question?
2006-12-26T08:54:00.000Z	SubMOA		roger
2006-12-26T08:56:00.000Z	un_operateur	SubMOA	were you going to ask a question? :)
2006-12-26T08:57:00.000Z	un_operateur	SubMOA	a .deb file is more like a .zip file .. but it has a executable file (like .exe in windows-speak) within that is run after the .deb is unpacked
2006-12-27T07:53:00.000Z	un_operateur	SubMOA	xchat :)
2006-12-27T07:54:00.000Z	un_operateur	SubMOA	avoid the "run" box and try the command-line directly
2006-12-27T07:54:00.000Z	un_operateur	SubMOA	that way you can tab-test -- type in xch<TAB>  .. and you'll get suggestions
2006-12-27T07:54:00.000Z	SubMOA	un_operateur	btw, what is that "run" box actually called
2006-12-27T07:55:00.000Z	un_operateur	SubMOA	gnome-launcher i think .. not sure, i dont use gnome
2006-12-27T07:55:00.000Z	SubMOA	un_operateur	rgr
2006-12-27T07:56:00.000Z	SubMOA	un_operateur	so that will show me pretty much anything that begins with "xch" (in your example you showed, at least)
2006-12-27T07:57:00.000Z	un_operateur	SubMOA	aye, exactly :)
2006-12-27T08:01:00.000Z	SubMOA	un_operateur	anything I type in the gnome-launcher thing should run just as easily from the terminal, right? without extra addresses or URL's or whatever they're called?  I don't need to change directories or anything?
2006-12-27T08:11:00.000Z	un_operateur	SubMOA	solution on?
2006-12-27T08:12:00.000Z	un_operateur	SubMOA	hacking through IRC?
2006-12-27T08:12:00.000Z	SubMOA	un_operateur	Riyonuk is trying to watch a flash video (from video.google.com) here and he says when it loads, firefox quits
2006-12-27T08:12:00.000Z	SubMOA	un_operateur	no, not that, although I was worried someone might mess with my comp, is there a way to protect from that?
2006-12-27T08:13:00.000Z	un_operateur	SubMOA	run a firewall and make sure any other open services are protected/patched/up2date
2006-12-27T08:13:00.000Z	SubMOA	un_operateur	rgr
2006-12-28T12:08:00.000Z	un_operateur	SubMOA	what do you mean?
2006-12-28T12:09:00.000Z	un_operateur	SubMOA	by shortcut i suppose you mean, menu shortcut?
