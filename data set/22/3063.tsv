2008-12-17T23:45:00.000Z	ikonia	brendan0powers	ignore that, recompiling the kenrnel won't do anything
2008-12-17T23:50:00.000Z	ikonia	brendan0powers	well is there any dump messages on screen ?
2008-12-17T23:51:00.000Z	brendan0powers	ikonia	not that I can see, although when it happens, I can't swith tty's or anything
2008-12-17T23:52:00.000Z	ikonia	brendan0powers	does the capslock light on the keyboard work if you press capslock ?
2008-12-17T23:52:00.000Z	brendan0powers	ikonia	i'm not sure
2008-12-17T23:52:00.000Z	ikonia	brendan0powers	worth checking, gives you an idea of would area the crash is in
2008-12-17T23:54:00.000Z	brendan0powers	ikonia	unfortuenetly it doesn't happen that often. If caps lock doesn't work, what would that mean?
2008-12-18T00:00:00.000Z	brendan0powers	ikonia	i've confirmed with someone else that numlock does not work after the server freezes
2008-12-18T00:00:00.000Z	ikonia	brendan0powers	ok, so sounds lke th it's a kernel panic
2008-12-18T00:02:00.000Z	brendan0powers	ikonia	is there a good way to get a backtrace or something when this happens
2008-12-18T00:02:00.000Z	ikonia	brendan0powers	depends how comfortable you are reading kernel dumps, what I would check is the syslog on the system see if anything was moaning before it panics
2008-12-18T00:03:00.000Z	ikonia	brendan0powers	also run the system monitor tools to monitor resources while it's in use, that can give you clues
2008-12-18T00:03:00.000Z	brendan0powers	ikonia	nothing unusual in the logs, and the systems aren't particularly busy at the time
2008-12-18T00:03:00.000Z	ikonia	brendan0powers	any 3rd party kernel modules ?
2008-12-18T00:04:00.000Z	brendan0powers	ikonia	no, should just be stock ubuntu server kernel
2008-12-18T00:04:00.000Z	ikonia	brendan0powers	ooh a server kernel
2008-12-18T00:04:00.000Z	ikonia	brendan0powers	what hardware ?
2008-12-18T00:04:00.000Z	ikonia	brendan0powers	are we talking home user PC stuff, or a proper bit of server hardware
2008-12-18T00:05:00.000Z	ikonia	brendan0powers	I'm only asking as running the server kernel on home user kit can cause issues, but that looks quite a realistic setup
2008-12-18T00:06:00.000Z	brendan0powers	ikonia	not sure if you saw the earlier comment, but we have about 20 of them spread through several locations, all ab out the same hardware
2008-12-18T00:06:00.000Z	ikonia	brendan0powers	no I missed that earlier
2008-12-18T00:06:00.000Z	brendan0powers	ikonia	oops, that went to the wrong person
