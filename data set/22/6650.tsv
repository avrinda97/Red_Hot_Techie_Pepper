2006-10-07T08:36:00.000Z	piglit		acordingly to this site http://sources.redhat.com/ml/gdb/2005-12/msg00053.html i need at least 6.4 of version avr-gdb in the repro of ubuntu there is only a 6.3 version what is the best way to get 6.4 unstall avr-gdb with apt-get uninstall avr-gdb and then compile the thing with ./configure --target=avr --prefix=/usr/local/AVR         then #make #make install ????
2006-10-07T08:36:00.000Z	piglit		unstall = uninstall
2006-10-07T08:36:00.000Z	piglit		or will i get in to trouble do-ing this?
2006-10-07T08:37:00.000Z	piglit		i get a error using 6.3
2006-10-07T08:38:00.000Z	ompaul	piglit	what does this support?
2006-10-07T08:36:00.000Z	ompaul	piglit	what are you trying to install
2006-10-07T08:37:00.000Z	piglit	ompaul	i need to get avr-gdb version 6.4
2006-10-07T08:37:00.000Z	ompaul	piglit	why?
2006-10-07T08:38:00.000Z	piglit	ompaul	like this error
2006-10-07T08:38:00.000Z	ompaul	piglit	(A) what are you trying to do (B) with what, and on which version of ubuntu
2006-10-07T08:39:00.000Z	ompaul	piglit	ahh
2006-10-07T08:39:00.000Z	ompaul	piglit	it is not made for ubuntu?
2006-10-07T08:39:00.000Z	piglit	ompaul	i am using version from ubuntu 6.06
2006-10-07T08:39:00.000Z	piglit	ompaul	i got avr-gdb with apt-get
2006-10-07T08:40:00.000Z	ompaul	piglit	it is not in the ubuntu repos so I strongly suggest you get it and compile it for ubuntu
2006-10-07T08:41:00.000Z	ompaul	piglit	apt-get remove --purge avr-gdb << before you start
2006-10-07T08:41:00.000Z	ompaul	piglit	how to compile it correctly has been sent to you by the bot
2006-10-07T08:42:00.000Z	ompaul	piglit	don't know it, it is not in the ubuntu repos so don't run debs unless you know they actually work
2006-10-07T08:54:00.000Z	piglit	ompaul	i made a mistake sorry it is called gdb-avr on the site you sent me but you start it with avr-gdb
2006-10-07T08:59:00.000Z	ompaul	piglit	I had a poke around with the correct package name, 6.4 is in edgy
2006-10-07T08:59:00.000Z	ompaul	piglit	edgy is still beta
2006-10-07T09:07:00.000Z	piglit	ompaul	when i do  sudo apt-get upgrade gdb-avr i tell's me there is no new version, and when i do avr-gdb -v i get GNU gdb 6.3
