2007-12-08T07:10:00.000Z	enigmata		<stroyan> I'm running ubuntu 2.6.22-14-generic with 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller, and need the patch applied to get sound on my Lenovo laptop.
2007-12-08T07:12:00.000Z	enigmata		<stroyan> Can you help me find a patch?
2007-12-08T07:13:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	know you dont need a patch
2007-12-08T07:14:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	you need the right options passed to the module and perhaps need to compile the latest alsa-driver from the alsa site
2007-12-08T07:14:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	I have the same chipset
2007-12-08T07:15:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	I upgraded the alsa-driver and edited ...
2007-12-08T07:16:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	hold on
2007-12-08T07:17:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	 http://rafb.net/p/owi0vn28.html
2007-12-08T07:18:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	that's my /etc/modprobe.d/alias-base
2007-12-08T07:18:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	type in that last line and change your model to leveno
2007-12-08T07:19:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	I compiled alsa-driver, alsa-lib, alsa-oss, and alsa-utils from source
2007-12-08T07:20:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	you may just want to start with the drivers and see what happens.. I forgot to bookmark the site I got the info from
2007-12-08T07:22:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	you can try it but I doubt it'll work I have a acer laptop
2007-12-08T07:22:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	you said leveno
2007-12-08T07:22:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	do what ya want
2007-12-08T07:24:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	I'd back up the l old module and delete it first.. You'll need the kernel headers
2007-12-08T07:25:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	there's a readme inside the source telling you how to compile
2007-12-08T07:25:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	What wireless card ya have?
2007-12-08T07:27:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	ipw2200 or something?
2007-12-08T07:29:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	you might want to see if it is the latest one
2007-12-08T07:32:00.000Z	huh	enigmata	Well if you get the latest alsa stuff a reboot may get it to work
