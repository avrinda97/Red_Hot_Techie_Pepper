2006-10-19T07:14:00.000Z	anon32	slavik	sure...
2006-10-19T07:14:00.000Z	anon32	slavik	I don't do wireless anyway, wired is so much better
2006-10-19T07:15:00.000Z	slavik	anon32	what about when you don't have _real_ access to wired?
2006-10-19T07:15:00.000Z	anon32	slavik	then go somewhere you do... wireless sucks ass
2006-10-19T07:16:00.000Z	slavik	anon32	tell that to my college's IT department (they suck)
2006-10-19T07:16:00.000Z	anon32	slavik	:-P
2006-10-19T07:20:00.000Z	anon32	slavik	the adobe forum
2006-10-19T07:23:00.000Z	slavik	anon32	pretty much, but ifconfig is more powerful
2006-10-19T07:23:00.000Z	slavik	anon32	ipconfig doesn't exist in *nix :P
2006-10-19T07:23:00.000Z	slavik	anon32	ifconfig can change the MAC address of your network card and you can fake another computer on the network ;)
2006-10-19T07:25:00.000Z	slavik	anon32	like what?
2006-10-19T07:25:00.000Z	anon32	slavik	opening network tools shows a dizzying number of simple DDoS tools
2006-10-19T07:26:00.000Z	anon32	slavik	if they don't release it, how do you know they have it?
2006-10-19T07:27:00.000Z	slavik	anon32	Linksys made a router based on Linux with Bcom chipset, they were required to release firmware, only reason there is ANY bcom open source driver
2006-10-19T07:27:00.000Z	anon32	slavik	open source? is there a closed one then?
2006-10-19T07:28:00.000Z	slavik	anon32	if you use the windows driver through ndis wrapper :P
2006-10-19T07:28:00.000Z	anon32	slavik	that works?
2006-10-19T07:28:00.000Z	slavik	anon32	man ethereal, man nmap, man ettercap, man kismet (if you want to see some network tools)
2006-10-19T07:29:00.000Z	anon32	slavik	:-P
2006-10-19T07:29:00.000Z	slavik	anon32	just use wikipedia since those man pages wouldn't be installed by default
2006-10-19T07:30:00.000Z	anon32	slavik	lol
