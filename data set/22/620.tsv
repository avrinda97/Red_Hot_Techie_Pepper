2011-06-16T12:03:00.000Z	newb_ie		So anybody there using vlc player on ubuntu 11.04.I ahve a problem with playing videos fullscreen
2011-06-16T12:03:00.000Z	tensorpudding	newb_ie	i am, and i have no issue
2011-06-16T12:04:00.000Z	newb_ie	tensorpudding	any idea how to remove the panels while playing a video
2011-06-16T12:05:00.000Z	tensorpudding	newb_ie	the panels shouldn't be an issue
2011-06-16T12:05:00.000Z	tensorpudding	newb_ie	when you fullscreen, they'll go away
2011-06-16T12:05:00.000Z	newb_ie		But mine doesnt go away
2011-06-16T12:06:00.000Z	tensorpudding	newb_ie	did you fullscreen it?
2011-06-16T12:06:00.000Z	newb_ie	tensorpudding	any solution to suggest?
2011-06-16T12:06:00.000Z	tensorpudding	newb_ie	it's not just maximizing
2011-06-16T12:06:00.000Z	newb_ie		yes I did fullscreen it
2011-06-16T12:06:00.000Z	tensorpudding	newb_ie	you have to double-click the video
2011-06-16T12:06:00.000Z	newb_ie	tensorpudding	Yes I did
2011-06-16T12:07:00.000Z	tensorpudding	newb_ie	and what happens?
2011-06-16T12:08:00.000Z	newb_ie	tensorpudding	The panels stay
2011-06-16T12:09:00.000Z	newb_ie	tensorpudding	Is there any possibility that panels are configured always on top
2011-06-16T12:09:00.000Z	tensorpudding	newb_ie	that's not possible
2011-06-16T12:10:00.000Z	tensorpudding	newb_ie	it must be a bug then, but i'm not sure what
2011-06-16T12:10:00.000Z	tensorpudding	newb_ie	are you using unity or classic?
2011-06-16T12:10:00.000Z	newb_ie	tensorpudding	I use classic
2011-06-16T12:11:00.000Z	tensorpudding	newb_ie	i don't know then, it works fine in unity for me
2011-06-16T12:11:00.000Z	newb_ie	tensorpudding	let me try in unity then
