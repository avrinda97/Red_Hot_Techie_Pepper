2009-06-15T20:59:00.000Z	Mnemonic^		Can someone answer this? How can I install a non stable package? I currently have dmraid-1.0.0.rc15-6ubuntu2 installed but I really need a fix in 1.0.0.rc15-7ubuntu1. How can I upgrade to this version?
2009-06-15T21:00:00.000Z	Mnemonic^		Can I somehow see when it is going to be released?

2009-06-15T21:01:00.000Z	dajhorn	Mnemonic^	The easiest way is to just download the .deb and manually install it with dpkg.  If you want to do it with apt, then you need to read about apt priorities and pinning.
2009-06-15T21:01:00.000Z	Mnemonic^	dajhorn	Where do I fint beta packages?
2009-06-15T21:02:00.000Z	dajhorn	Mnemonic^	packages.ubuntu.com in the "karmic" repositories.
2009-06-15T21:02:00.000Z	Mnemonic^	dajhorn	Thanks
2009-06-15T21:03:00.000Z	Mnemonic^	dajhorn	What does karmic mean?
2009-06-15T21:03:00.000Z	dajhorn	Mnemonic^	It is the code name for the next Ubuntu release.
2009-06-15T21:03:00.000Z	Mnemonic^	dajhorn	ok.
2010-09-03T22:30:00.000Z	dajhorn	Mnemonic^	It does the same thing as `cut -f2 -d:` or $2 in `awk`.   Don't ask homework questions here.
2010-09-03T22:31:00.000Z	Mnemonic^	dajhorn	Hehe .. Thanks .. Not homework.. :) I am breaking down a script, as it does not work.
2010-09-03T22:32:00.000Z	Mnemonic^	dajhorn	So it uses country": as a delimiter?
2010-09-03T22:32:00.000Z	dajhorn	Mnemonic^	It removes the country delimiter.  This is sorta-kinda-mostly a regex for "print the second column".
2010-09-03T22:33:00.000Z	dajhorn	Mnemonic^	You would usually see this in the "sed -n -e s/foo/bar/p" form.
2010-09-03T22:33:00.000Z	Mnemonic^	dajhorn	Ok.. Thanks
2010-09-03T22:33:00.000Z	dajhorn	Mnemonic^	Are you debugging an Ubuntu system script?  Or something local?
2010-09-03T22:36:00.000Z	Mnemonic^	dajhorn	I am debugging a script called Prey, that should be able to locate your laptop if it gets lost or stolen. But it would be SOOO COOL if the taught sed when i went to school.
2010-09-03T22:38:00.000Z	dajhorn	Mnemonic^	There are other channels specifically for scripting and programming.  You're likely to get better answers there.
2010-09-03T22:39:00.000Z	Mnemonic^	dajhorn	I know .. X-Chat tricked me into asking here, I was actually going to ask in #sed
2010-09-03T22:39:00.000Z	Mnemonic^	dajhorn	Thanks anyway :)
2010-09-03T22:39:00.000Z	dajhorn	Mnemonic^	Welcome regardless.
