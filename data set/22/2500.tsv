2010-05-17T23:48:00.000Z	tweepcat		Hi, I am trying to boot, and hopefully install if I like it, ubuntu from a USB stick using unetbootin on a windows computer. When I reboot and go to the boot menu, F12 because I am on a dell, I select the usb drive and it says "drive without operating system". Please could I have any help or suggestions?
2010-05-17T23:50:00.000Z	tweepcat		Any help guys?

2010-05-17T23:52:00.000Z	tweepcat		MD5 test?
2010-05-17T23:53:00.000Z	tweepcat		thanks, i will read that now
2010-05-17T23:54:00.000Z	tweepcat		i downloaded it from the ubuntu site
2010-05-17T23:54:00.000Z	tweepcat		what would be wrong with it?
2010-05-17T23:55:00.000Z	neurochrome	tweepcat	just md5sum the file
2010-05-17T23:55:00.000Z	neurochrome	tweepcat	cross reference it with the current md5 for the file on the ubuntu site
2010-05-17T23:57:00.000Z	neurochrome	tweepcat	sometimes a file can be corrupt for whatever reason, your best to double-check
2010-05-17T23:57:00.000Z	neurochrome	tweepcat	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes
2010-05-17T23:57:00.000Z	neurochrome	tweepcat	here is a guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto
2010-05-18T00:00:00.000Z	neurochrome	tweepcat	right...
2010-05-18T00:00:00.000Z	neurochrome	tweepcat	each iso has a hash -  ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso -- is -- d044a2a0c8103fc3e5b7e18b0f7de1c8
2010-05-18T00:01:00.000Z	neurochrome	tweepcat	if you locate the iso you downloaded - let's say the name is ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.is
2010-05-18T00:01:00.000Z	neurochrome	tweepcat	in terminal do "md5sum ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso" and it should spurt out "d044a2a0c8103fc3e5b7e18b0f7de1c8"
2010-05-18T00:02:00.000Z	neurochrome	tweepcat	note that you have to either be in the folder where the file is or use the actual location as well in the filename
2010-05-18T00:03:00.000Z	neurochrome	tweepcat	eg; "md5sum ~/Desktop/ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso"
2010-05-18T00:03:00.000Z	neurochrome	tweepcat	just read the manual - "man md5sum" in a terminal
2010-05-18T00:05:00.000Z	neurochrome	tweepcat	because sometimes file integrity can be compromised.. if it were an mp3 it wouldn't really be an issue, but this is an OS we're talking about.. check it to be sure your installing a 100% ok OS
2010-05-18T00:05:00.000Z	neurochrome	tweepcat	if this is too hard to grasp, I wish you the best of luck with linux ;)
2010-05-18T00:09:00.000Z	neurochrome	tweepcat	no worries
