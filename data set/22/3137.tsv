2008-12-27T11:54:00.000Z	BellinXFelon		i have a question
2008-12-27T11:55:00.000Z	BellinXFelon		what program can i use to write C, C+. C++ and C # as well as perl, and javascript
2008-12-27T11:55:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	vi?
2008-12-27T11:55:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	any text editor
2008-12-27T11:58:00.000Z	BellinXFelon	maco	where do i get vim or emacs
2008-12-27T11:58:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	well vim-tiny is installed by default
2008-12-27T12:01:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	you can use synaptic to install vim-full
2008-12-27T12:26:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	C++, you mean?
2008-12-27T12:26:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	you will try to learn all programming languages, and then you will learn the truth: there is only 1 programming language, but many forms of syntax
2008-12-27T12:33:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	you type "vim newfile.c" or whatever you want the file to be in a terminal
2008-12-27T12:37:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	you might not want vim or emacs... those are both keyboard-driven text editors (very fast once you get the hang of it, but there's a learning curve). gedit (applications -> accessories) might be easier to start with
2008-12-27T12:38:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	vim and emacs are very powerful too. if you want to learn vim, i suggest applications -> accessories --> terminal, and run the commabd "vimtutor" to learn to use it
2008-12-27T12:42:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	but what *kind* of software? there are many branches
2008-12-27T12:42:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	well you want to start with one thing, get good at it, then move on, probably
2008-12-27T12:48:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	yeah java's one that "enterprise" crap likes. C's classic. Ruby's the new fad for web development
2008-12-27T12:49:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	terminal to compile as well. i suggested vim before because its a text editor that lives in the terminal
2008-12-27T12:50:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	you can run commands (like make, to compile) from inside it
2008-12-27T12:53:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	check out tldp.org
2008-12-27T12:53:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	it has howtos for um....everything
2008-12-27T12:58:00.000Z	BellinXFelon	maco	: how did you learn all these things?
2008-12-27T12:59:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	experience?
2009-09-05T08:36:00.000Z	maco	BellinXFelon	no need to compile from source. its in the repositories
