2008-01-11T14:52:00.000Z	compwiz18		where would one find the HAL log at?
2008-01-11T14:53:00.000Z	zenobius	compwiz18	not in /var/logs ?
2008-01-11T14:54:00.000Z	compwiz18	zenobius	if it is, it isn't called hal.log
2008-01-11T14:54:00.000Z	zenobius	compwiz18	since gutsy or feisty are having many different variations in its conf files etc, which one are you using...
2008-01-11T14:54:00.000Z	compwiz18	zenobius	gutsy
2008-01-11T14:56:00.000Z	compwiz18	zenobius	the wiki tells us what is up with that : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingRemovableDevices
2008-01-11T14:57:00.000Z	compwiz18	zenobius	it would appear there is no log file...
2008-01-11T14:57:00.000Z	zenobius	compwiz18	your trying to mount ipod auto style?
2008-01-11T14:58:00.000Z	compwiz18	zenobius	nope, trying to mount my usb key, sudo mount works fine, hal doesn't. works fine on all the XP comps I've tried too
2008-01-11T14:58:00.000Z	zenobius	compwiz18	it would work fine on xp since they have all the funding and tech docs
2008-01-11T14:58:00.000Z	zenobius	compwiz18	but i would stronlgy suggest you use feisty instead
2008-01-11T14:59:00.000Z	compwiz18	zenobius	why should I use Feisty?
2008-01-11T14:59:00.000Z	zenobius	compwiz18	far more stable and reliable
2008-01-11T14:59:00.000Z	compwiz18	zenobius	gutsy seems fine to me...
2008-01-11T15:00:00.000Z	zenobius	compwiz18	im using it becuase xrandr decides my card cant do dual screen nor 3d, but look at me now, in fiesty i have compiz running over two screens as one large desktop, video playing on both...down with xrandr
2008-01-11T15:00:00.000Z	compwiz18	zenobius	my computer can't power compiz on the monitor i'm using (bad gfx card) and compiz is slow with ati drivers anyway
2008-01-11T15:01:00.000Z	zenobius	compwiz18	upto you, your actually using a version hat hasnt been fully tested.
2008-01-11T15:01:00.000Z	compwiz18	zenobius	ok
2008-01-11T15:01:00.000Z	zenobius	compwiz18	waht card? im using raedon 9600.
2008-01-11T15:02:00.000Z	compwiz18	zenobius	ati 200m, it's a laptop,
2008-01-11T15:02:00.000Z	compwiz18	zenobius	and the latest drivers don't support 1680x1050, which is the size of my monitor, so... I'm stuck with mesa because something got screwed up
2008-01-11T15:03:00.000Z	zenobius	compwiz18	im happy with 1024x768
