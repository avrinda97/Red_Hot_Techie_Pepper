2007-02-18T16:20:00.000Z	ernz		Hi - I am having problems with something called glx. I am running Ubuntu Edgy. Now apps I used to use on dapper aren't working like Armagetron, and I even tried to install beryl, and even that complains about glx.
2007-02-18T14:36:00.000Z	ernz		Hi - I have a problem not necessarily Ubuntu related. I am trying to format a disk to ext3. I have used GParted - But that keeps returning an unspecified error. Using something called parted I got the error: Warning: "You requested a partition from 32.8kB to 120GB. The closest location we can manage is 31.7kB to 31.7kB.  Is this still acceptable to you?" Can someone please help me out here?
2007-02-18T14:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 that almost sounds like the disk is bad..
2007-02-18T14:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 anything on the disk you are trying to save?
2007-02-18T14:37:00.000Z	ernz	Dr_willis	- It sounds like it, but it was working in a computer recently.
2007-02-18T14:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 ive had hard drives working.. then go 'click , click, CLUNK' and be dead. :(
2007-02-18T14:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 while i was using the system. :()
2007-02-18T14:42:00.000Z	ernz	Dr_willis	- It was during an Ubuntu clean install that this disk seems to have died. Does this make it Ubuntu's fault?
2007-02-18T14:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 not really.
2007-02-18T14:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 drives die.. they are perhaps the most unreliable part of your pc.
2007-02-18T14:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 you could try 'fdisk' and delete all the partitions, and have fdisk remake them.
2007-02-18T14:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 you want to save the data on it? or just whipe it out?
2007-02-18T14:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 fdisk may be able to whipe it out.. or go hard core and use 'dd' to zero the drive.. or try some other disk whiping tools.
2007-02-18T14:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 if theres nothing worth saving on the hard drive.. use dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/drive   >BUT BE CAREFULL<
2007-02-18T14:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 a typo in that line = trashed system
2007-02-18T14:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 thats a bit extreme... id see if fdisk can delete the partitions first
2007-02-18T14:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 also check the bios - see what sizes it says the drive is.
2007-02-18T14:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 ive had a drive that had some issues and was getting reported tobe 2gb in size.. when it was 200 ...  controller on the drive messed up. = not fixable.
2007-02-18T14:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 dd: writing to `/dev/hdb': Input/output error    is NOT a good sign
2007-02-18T14:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 could try to have gparted make 2 partitions.. one a few mb (perhaps a gb) at the start of the drive.. then the rest at the end...
2007-02-18T14:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 i wouldent trust that drive very much. ;
2007-02-18T14:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ernz	 :) it pays to backup.
