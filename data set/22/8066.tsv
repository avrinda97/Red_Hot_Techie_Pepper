2006-05-26T11:07:00.000Z	Stargazers		Hi. Is there any way how I can install Ubuntu without local hard drive. I mean I have other computer as a NFS server where I'd like to install that Ubuntu.
2006-05-26T11:07:00.000Z	Stargazers		Any ideas how?
2006-05-26T11:08:00.000Z	Stargazers		I have tried to google 2 days almost :/
2006-05-26T11:08:00.000Z	spacey	Stargazers	boot from network
2006-05-26T11:09:00.000Z	Stargazers	spacey	Impossible, I have no bootable lan card
2006-05-26T11:11:00.000Z	Stargazers	spacey	What you mean?
2006-05-26T11:12:00.000Z	spacey	Stargazers	ifyou make it a thinclient, you can boot it from network with a cd, and then everything runs at the server
2006-05-26T11:13:00.000Z	spacey	Stargazers	which box is most fast? the one without disk or with?
2006-05-26T11:14:00.000Z	spacey	Stargazers	you should look into LTSP
2006-05-26T11:15:00.000Z	spacey	Stargazers	look in the ubuntu wiki for LTSP
2006-05-26T11:16:00.000Z	spacey	Stargazers	anyway, just see what you want. You can use the 300mhz diskless with LTSP, and take advantage of the speed of your fast PC. Its nice.
2006-05-26T11:16:00.000Z	Stargazers	spacey	Yep, but I mean that IN THE FUTURE I have no that other PC, only external Hard Drive
2006-05-26T11:18:00.000Z	Stargazers	spacey	Did you now understood what I meant?
2006-05-26T11:19:00.000Z	Stargazers	spacey	And the other problem is that I have no PXE support
2006-05-26T11:20:00.000Z	spacey	Stargazers	you can burn a bootable cd image with PXE
2006-05-26T11:21:00.000Z	Stargazers	spacey	Oh. Have to look if I find something...
2006-05-26T11:21:00.000Z	spacey	Stargazers	www.rom-o-matic.net
2006-05-26T11:22:00.000Z	spacey	Stargazers	you'll understand if you look at ltsp docs. but i can't solve the problem if you have no servers with disks at all
2006-05-26T11:22:00.000Z	Stargazers	spacey	I have a server with disks now
2006-05-26T11:23:00.000Z	spacey	Stargazers	if you also want to run all your applications on it LTSP would be perfect.
2006-05-26T11:24:00.000Z	Stargazers	spacey	But LTSP need computer as a server
2006-05-26T11:24:00.000Z	Stargazers	spacey	Yep, but I want to install that kind of linux isntallation that needs no other computers, only loads linux on external hard drive
