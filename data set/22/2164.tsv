2009-09-08T05:19:00.000Z	WilliamC2		I have a problem
2009-09-08T05:19:00.000Z	WilliamC2		My NVidia driver now no longer loads after I updated it
2009-09-08T05:20:00.000Z	WilliamC2		So, can someone please help me
2009-09-08T05:21:00.000Z	Fenrod	WilliamC2	/var/log/Xorg.0.log would be the first place to look for something wierd
2009-09-08T05:21:00.000Z	WilliamC2		wierd?
2009-09-08T05:21:00.000Z	WilliamC2		I already see a syntax error, Fenrod.:P\
2009-09-08T05:22:00.000Z	Fenrod	WilliamC2	well any type of error message
2009-09-08T05:25:00.000Z	WilliamC2	Fenrod	http://pastebin.com/m3a252156
2009-09-08T05:25:00.000Z	Fenrod	WilliamC2	does 'lsmod' list the nvidia Kernel module?
2009-09-08T05:26:00.000Z	WilliamC2		Partition Magic used to be used when LILO was the primary boot loader
2009-09-08T05:26:00.000Z	WilliamC2	Fenrod	yeah.
2009-09-08T05:27:00.000Z	WilliamC2		I'm glad that LILO was replaced by Grub
2009-09-08T05:27:00.000Z	WilliamC2		is LILO still active?
2009-09-08T05:30:00.000Z	Fenrod	WilliamC2	well at first glance it simply looks like you dont have a supported graphics card. But that probably not the case. Try a X server startup with the -verbose 4 and -logverbose 4 parameter to get a more detailed output
2009-09-08T05:31:00.000Z	Fenrod	WilliamC2	and sometimes the nvidia modules logs stuff to dmesg, might be worth a look too
2009-09-08T05:32:00.000Z	WilliamC2	Fenrod	where do I find that?
2009-09-08T05:33:00.000Z	Fenrod	WilliamC2	type 'dmesg' (without quotes) to your console or terminal
2009-09-08T05:35:00.000Z	WilliamC2	Fenrod	how do I kill gnome again?
2009-09-08T05:39:00.000Z	Fenrod	WilliamC2	hmm ... unfortunatly i'm not that familliar with the ubuntu runlevel system, so an init 3 at the console might bring you to console mode without X. Other than that killing the X-Server (with 'killall X') should kill gnome too. But the display-manager might simply start gnome again. So you ahve to try which methord works.
2009-09-08T05:59:00.000Z	WilliamC2		Yeah, it's still not better, FenRod
2009-09-08T06:02:00.000Z	Fenrod	WilliamC2	any errormessages in dmesg? What does the X server-log say when started with -verbose 4 and -logverbose 4?
