2009-07-04T04:39:00.000Z	neilv		hello. any idea how long it'll take for an ubuntu-specific DoS exploit in apache to become a security update?
2009-07-04T04:40:00.000Z	Radtoo	neilv	well it usually happens... fast?
2009-07-04T04:41:00.000Z	Radtoo	neilv	http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/serveredition/features/security http://www.ubuntu.com/usn are what's relevant here I guess. There's no exact time tho.
2009-07-04T04:43:00.000Z	Radtoo	neilv	"his" request? it should be reported on launchpad, no?
2009-07-04T04:44:00.000Z	Radtoo	neilv	or the email address specified...
2009-07-04T04:44:00.000Z	neilv	Radtoo	it's all on the web page: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apache2/+bug/394350
2009-07-04T04:49:00.000Z	Radtoo	neilv	good. well, I can't speak for the ubuntu team or whatever, but with this many assignees to the bug it would have been seen. But perhaps there's remote exploits or something that needed attention first?
2009-07-04T04:50:00.000Z	neilv	Radtoo	also, it is a big holiday weekend in the u.s. :) unfortunately, my users need a resolution by first thing on monday morning
2009-07-04T04:51:00.000Z	Radtoo	neilv	I hope you get it, but there's nothing I could do about it? Perhaps you'll have to remove the patches yourself or something as an interim solution.
2009-07-04T04:52:00.000Z	neilv	Radtoo	they will just have to go with apache upstream. they are not happy with that idea, especially since the point of ubuntu lts was to have a stable self-contained platform.
2009-07-04T04:55:00.000Z	Radtoo	neilv	Dunno if "they" are the only ones that think this way. About all major distros ship apache with patches at times, from my experience.
2009-07-04T04:56:00.000Z	neilv	Radtoo	normally, we appreciate the patches. unfortunately, they're broken in this case, and we might *have* to use upstream, for the sake of avoiding our server being taken down by a runaway cgi :)
2009-07-04T05:00:00.000Z	Radtoo	neilv	Right. Good catch. And the bug report might help other users / organizations who might have problems. But until you know if it will be fixed I think you're best off just fixing it yourself (you know how to create a .deb?) so you don't have to rely on anyone. :D
2009-07-04T05:01:00.000Z	neilv	Radtoo	well, there goes my weekend, debugging patches made by others :)
2009-07-04T05:03:00.000Z	Radtoo	neilv	Thats even better than just dropping the patches and doing a vanilla .deb. If you can find the exact problem that's likely very useful, eh. :)
2009-07-04T05:13:00.000Z	Radtoo	neilv	ubuntu is open source. you have access to the rules file of apache and such. Might just comment out / delete the patch specific stuff from ubuntus sources and just do your deb with that.
2009-07-04T05:06:00.000Z	Radtoo	neilv	But if you do it it might take a moment for the patch to be verified (anyone could introduce vulnerabilities or problems into apache otherwise) so caluculate in the time for doing your own .deb.
2009-07-04T05:06:00.000Z	neilv	Radtoo	i won't do my own .deb.  i will move to upstream if we can't wait for an official security update
2009-07-04T05:07:00.000Z	Radtoo	neilv	ehm... yes, your .deb with upstream apache was what I thought?
2009-07-04T05:07:00.000Z	Radtoo	neilv	seems un-nice to deploy an unmanaged source based install on every machine ...
2009-07-04T05:09:00.000Z	neilv	Radtoo	it is un-nice. but we really don't want the headache of custom .debs and are not set up to deploy that any better than a .tgz
2009-07-04T05:15:00.000Z	Radtoo	neilv	but all is at your own discretion. if you prefer make install or whatever apache uses at this point, go ahead. it just won't be managed the same way everything else is, which - in my experience - is a pain and why most any distribution out there uses a package manager to track files.
