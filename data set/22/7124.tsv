2006-06-07T16:41:00.000Z	skippy81	d00by	 whats the problem?
2006-06-07T16:41:00.000Z	d00by	skippy81	says some files cant be found
2006-06-07T16:42:00.000Z	skippy81	d00by	 in what context - are you seaching for them? or is it an error message?
2006-06-07T16:43:00.000Z	d00by	skippy81	it says / /lib/modules/2.6.12-10-386/build: No such file or directory
2006-06-07T16:43:00.000Z	d00by	skippy81	and then /lib/modules/2.6.12-10-386/build is missing, please set KERNELPATH.  Stop.
2006-06-07T16:43:00.000Z	skippy81	d00by	 ok, but wen is that error message shown? are you trying to compile a program
2006-06-07T16:44:00.000Z	d00by	skippy81	i am trying to install madwifi which is becoming a pain
2006-06-07T16:44:00.000Z	d00by	skippy81	it does it when i do make, make install, and make clean
2006-06-07T16:44:00.000Z	skippy81	d00by	 "sudo apt-get build-essential"
2006-06-07T16:45:00.000Z	skippy81	d00by	 "sudo apt-get install build-essential" sorry :) thx gnomefreak :0
2006-06-07T16:45:00.000Z	d00by	skippy81	blah i already started updagrade process and i cant use root term for apt-get
2006-06-07T16:46:00.000Z	skippy81	d00by	 oh ok, well when you next attempt to build something, remember you will need the build-essential package, and probably the kernel headers to match your kernel d00by - these packages can be found with synaptic
2006-06-07T16:47:00.000Z	d00by	skippy81	i have been able to do make and make install before though
2006-06-07T16:47:00.000Z	d00by	skippy81	this isn't the first time i have tried to build
2006-06-07T16:48:00.000Z	skippy81	d00by	 in that case you must have had build-essential allready, but not the kernel-headers
2006-06-07T16:48:00.000Z	d00by	skippy81	where do i download kernal-headers? apt-get install kernal-headers?
2006-06-07T16:48:00.000Z	skippy81	d00by	 kernel-headers to match your kernel are always needed to install modules - modules are customised for your kernel
2006-06-07T16:48:00.000Z	skippy81	d00by	 the easiest way is to type "uname -r" to get your kernel version
2006-06-07T16:49:00.000Z	skippy81	d00by	then search synaptic for the correct kernel headers package
