2007-08-10T08:44:00.000Z	pike_	wizo	i had an older card about same version
2007-08-10T08:45:00.000Z	wizo	pike_	ah i see, thanks
2007-08-10T08:52:00.000Z	wizo	pike_	i was reading the document.. and it said to run sudo nvidia-xconfig, but i tried and it says command not found
2007-08-10T08:53:00.000Z	pike_	wizo	it should be pulled in when you sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-legacy
2007-08-10T08:53:00.000Z	wizo	pike_	really? :s i just did apt-get isntall nvidia-glx-legacy =(
2007-08-10T08:54:00.000Z	wizo	pike_	do i really need it? can i just edit my xorg.conf file ?
2007-08-10T08:55:00.000Z	pike_	wizo	no you can setup xorg and stuff but go ahead and sudo apt-get install nvidia-xconfig   then run that other command
2007-08-10T08:57:00.000Z	pike_	wizo	yeah it makes a new one and backs old one up sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart now and test
2007-08-10T08:57:00.000Z	wizo	pike_	alright thanks
2007-08-10T09:00:00.000Z	wizo	pike_	it displays a console on boot up.. when i type startx.. the screen goes really black
2007-08-10T09:21:00.000Z	wizo	pike_	you there?
2007-08-10T09:22:00.000Z	pike_	wizo	yeah
2007-08-10T09:23:00.000Z	wizo	pike_	how did you get your card to work? all i get is a dead screen after i type startx into console at start.
2007-08-10T09:24:00.000Z	pike_	wizo	usually all i need to do is apt-get the glx package and thats it. what does /var/log/Xorg.0.log say?
2007-08-10T09:24:00.000Z	wizo	pike_	what should i look out for
2007-08-10T09:25:00.000Z	wizo	pike_	this caught my eye, (EE) Failed to initialize GLX extension (NVIDIA X driver not found)
2007-08-10T09:26:00.000Z	pike_	wizo	that would catch my eye too :) ive gotta replicate a few things for work real quick so maybe somone else here has suggestion
2007-08-10T09:26:00.000Z	wizo	pike_	oh ok then, thanks =)
