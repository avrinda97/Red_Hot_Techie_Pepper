2011-02-06T09:46:00.000Z	kofte		I've come across some information on the Ubuntu forum without much explanation, and I just wanted to clarify
2011-02-06T09:46:00.000Z	kofte		hi ActionParsnip
2011-02-06T09:46:00.000Z	kofte		Is it true that unsigned repositories won't work on AMD64?
2011-02-06T09:47:00.000Z	rww	kofte	can you link to the forums post that says that, please?
2011-02-06T09:47:00.000Z	kofte	rww	sure, just a sec
2011-02-06T09:49:00.000Z	rww	kofte	I read that as the Skype repository being 32-bit only. AMD64 systems can install unauthenticated packages just fine.
2011-02-06T09:52:00.000Z	rww	kofte	and indeed, it appears that the repository is 32-bit only. Skype's website is being silly and not showing me directory listing, but the amd64 repository files appear to not be there.
2011-02-06T09:52:00.000Z	kofte	rww	what would be the consequences of that?
2011-02-06T09:53:00.000Z	rww	kofte	that you can't use the repository method if you're on a 64-bit system, as the help.ubuntu.com page says.
2011-02-06T09:56:00.000Z	kofte	rww	I'm still confused about what's going on with my PCs.  Both of them have 64 bit processors.  However, on one of them, I accidentally installed Ubuntu 32-bit.  The one that has a problem with the Skype repository is the 32-bit OS one.
2011-02-06T09:56:00.000Z	rww	kofte	How did you install Skype on the 64-bit one?
2011-02-06T09:57:00.000Z	rww	kofte	also, why are you asking about unsigned repositories and 64-bit systems if you're having issues with a 32-bit system :|
2011-02-06T09:58:00.000Z	kofte	rww	because of what I read on the forum, it seems to be part of the puzzle.  I'm asking to figure out the rest of it!
2011-02-06T09:59:00.000Z	rww	kofte	There is no amd64 component to that skype repository, so I am skeptical that you installed skype on an amd64 system using it. You may want to run "uname -a" and check that the machine you think is 64-bit says x86_64 on it.
2011-02-06T10:01:00.000Z	kofte	rww	the machine with working Skype says: Linux 2.6.31-22-generic #70-Ubuntu SMP Wed Dec 1 23:51:13 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux
2011-02-06T10:01:00.000Z	rww	kofte	that's 32-bit.
2011-02-06T10:02:00.000Z	kofte	rww	is that the machine or the OS?
2011-02-06T10:03:00.000Z	rww	kofte	the OS. Whether your CPU is 32-bit or 64-bit is irrelevant to this.
2011-02-06T10:05:00.000Z	kofte	rww	the other machine says: Linux 2.6.31-22-generic #70-Ubuntu SMP Wed Dec 1 23:48:17 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux
2011-02-06T10:05:00.000Z	rww	kofte	that's 64-bit
2011-02-06T10:06:00.000Z	kofte	rww	OK, then I got them mixed up.  I accidentally installed a 32-bit OS on the machine with working Skype.  So I guess that solves the riddle.
