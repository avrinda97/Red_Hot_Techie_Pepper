2010-09-02T10:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	faizaff	 does it have propriatary drivers installed?
2010-09-02T10:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	faizaff	you didn't answer my question.  is this a fresh install or did you install video drivers?
2010-09-02T10:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	faizaff	if it worked before you eather upgraded your kernel or installed drivers.  you can try boot the older kernel if you upgraded or you can rename the /etc/X11/xorg.conf  to disable the drivers
2010-09-02T10:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	faizaff	ok then that's probly it

2010-09-02T10:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	faizaff	and try cd into the dir that you mounted

2010-09-02T10:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	faizaff	 when you get to the dir X11  then ls  and see if you see a file xorg.conf  if you do rename it   rn xorg.conf xorg.conf.org
