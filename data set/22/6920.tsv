2006-07-11T13:23:00.000Z	finalbeta		Does someone have a page explaining the kernel? Y does VMWare need to use kernel sources, under windows it's not needed.
2006-07-11T13:24:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	it doesn't necesssarily need kernel sources, if you already have a binary version of the VMWare modules *for the version of the kernel you have*
2006-07-11T13:25:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	it's just that whenever the linux kernel changes, you'll need a new VMWare binary module. on windows, this doesn't happen simply because the kernel doesn't change, or when it changes it strives to mantain binary compatibility for drivers
2006-07-11T13:26:00.000Z	finalbeta	LjL	yes, that's actually a mess, now everytime I would update the kernel, I need to recofigure VMware right? same on my laptop for wireless internet
2006-07-11T13:26:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	yes.
2006-09-28T13:43:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	sudo dpkg-reconfigure kdm (or gdm, or whatever)
2006-10-10T16:09:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	no, that shouldn't happen
2006-11-18T11:37:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	there's no random password afaik, it's just locked
2006-11-18T11:38:00.000Z	finalbeta	LjL	ah, did that change? because a vuln once was that the installer put the random password in the install logs.
2006-12-21T09:22:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	the standard color dialog in KDE ;)
2006-12-21T09:23:00.000Z	finalbeta	LjL	and gnome has one where?
2006-12-21T09:23:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	seriously, *every* color dialog in KDE has that possibility, maybe GNOME has the same... try like the color settings in the control panel
2006-12-21T09:27:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	how many does it have that are *installed by default*?
2006-12-21T09:27:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	if you're ready to install them yourself, i don't think there will be a problem
2006-12-21T09:27:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	"apt-cache search color pick" gives enough interesting results here
2006-12-21T09:27:00.000Z	finalbeta	LjL	i'm trying to find one but can't in synaptic
2007-02-13T08:10:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	i don't know about scheduling, but i suppose that in the worst case, you could do with some shell script
2007-03-07T14:31:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	dunno, inkscape?
2007-04-05T16:55:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	then disable it... anyway, it's not precisely the latest buzz, it's been there since like the 1980s :P
2007-04-20T05:42:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	the latter, i suspect
2007-04-20T05:42:00.000Z	finalbeta	LjL	yeah, I assumed as much 2. Kind off kills the whole point of it.
2007-04-20T05:43:00.000Z	LjL	finalbeta	well, you *really* cannot distribute the Win32 codecs. that, Ubuntu just cannot do. still however, VLC should be able to play some WMA's, and maybe gstreamer can do the same
