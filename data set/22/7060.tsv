2007-04-11T05:09:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntunewb	to add all the extra official repositories and install flashplugin-nonfree, make sure synaptic, update-manager, or any other package managers are closed, open a terminal (applications>accessories>terminal) and copy and paste the following all at once:
2007-04-11T05:13:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntunewb	in firefox go to about:plugins
2007-04-11T05:15:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntunewb	go to about:plugins in firefox and see what it says about flash
2007-04-11T05:18:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	bruenig	what should i be looking for about the plugins
2007-04-11T05:18:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntunewb	the part that talks about flash
2007-04-11T05:20:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	bruenig	it just tells me to uninstall and install it again, i think this would be the 3rd time i've done it though
2007-04-11T05:20:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntunewb	about:plugins
2007-04-11T05:21:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntunewb	put that in the location bar
2007-04-11T05:24:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	bruenig	k, just put that in
2007-04-11T05:25:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	bruenig	it says shockwave flash is enabled
2007-04-11T05:25:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntunewb	but what version
2007-04-11T05:26:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	bruenig	Shockwave Flash 9.0 r31
2007-04-11T05:26:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntunewb	are there any other things that talk about flash (perhaps you have more than one plugin installed)
2007-04-11T05:27:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	bruenig	i have java enabled too, i don't know if that would conflict with it
2007-04-11T05:28:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	bruenig	there is nothing else about flash though
2007-04-11T05:28:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntunewb	no, link me to the website you are having problems with
2007-04-11T05:29:00.000Z	ubuntunewb	bruenig	link you to the about:plugins page
2007-04-11T05:29:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntunewb	link me to a website that doesn't work for you
2007-04-11T05:30:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntunewb	ok do "ls /usr/lib/firefox/plugins" and pastebin the output
