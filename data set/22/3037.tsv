2008-12-28T10:44:00.000Z	dingle88	stan	there is no program like the 'install' thing on the desktop on the livecd that i can use?
2008-12-28T10:44:00.000Z	stan	dingle88	I have no idea.  you asked how to install over anetwork.
2008-12-28T10:44:00.000Z	stan	dingle88	I will now stop assisting you.
2008-12-28T10:46:00.000Z	stan	dingle88	i read your second question; which showed that your first question was a waste of time; so subsequent questions most likely are as well.
2008-12-28T10:47:00.000Z	dingle88	stan	my first question proved looks to be a bitch to do, so i asked a second way to do it
2008-12-28T10:49:00.000Z	stan	dingle88	you need a new career, no job should make you an asshole to other people.
2008-12-28T10:49:00.000Z	dingle88	stan	ok.
2008-12-28T10:50:00.000Z	dingle88	stan	you goto afghanistan and fight guerillas and see what not paying attention gets you
2008-12-28T10:50:00.000Z	stan	dingle88	I prefer not to break the law thx.
2008-12-28T10:51:00.000Z	dingle88	stan	please grant me your eternal forgiveness
2008-12-28T10:52:00.000Z	stan	dingle88	you can mount an iso with the loop filesystem argument.
2008-12-28T10:58:00.000Z	stan	dingle88	no
2008-12-28T10:58:00.000Z	stan	dingle88	some are -- some arent.
2008-12-28T10:59:00.000Z	stan	dingle88	99% of the world does :D
2008-12-28T11:00:00.000Z	dingle88	stan	i have other hardware besides this
2008-12-28T11:00:00.000Z	stan	dingle88	congrats.  Thats why I said 99%
