2010-06-19T05:37:00.000Z	tyler_d|werkin	phenom	that is a video card problem, do you have proprietary drivers
2010-06-19T05:39:00.000Z	tyler_d|werkin	phenom	as well do "sudo tail -f /var/log/dmesg /var/log/Xorg.0.log /var/log/syslog" and check the output after you try and switch

2010-06-19T05:45:00.000Z	tyler_d|werkin	phenom	you need to fix your alsa-mixer --- usb
2010-06-19T05:45:00.000Z	tyler_d|werkin	phenom	once that is done you will be set
2010-06-19T05:46:00.000Z	phenom	tyler_d|werkin	Any idea where to start?
2010-06-19T05:46:00.000Z	tyler_d|werkin	phenom	I would recommend checking and re-installing alsa-mixer and related packages through the repo, as well the proprietary drivers for your nvidia card
2010-06-19T05:46:00.000Z	tyler_d|werkin	phenom	I have to run now, but thats your start ;)
