2007-01-22T08:43:00.000Z	deafboy	phaidros	the odd part is windows gets it right
2007-01-22T08:39:00.000Z	phaidros	deafboy	thats windows foo, somewhere windows has stored the old size ..
2007-01-22T08:40:00.000Z	phaidros	deafboy	maybe some fixmbr can help ..
2007-01-22T08:40:00.000Z	deafboy	phaidros	can you run fixmbr from something other than a windows cd?
2007-01-22T08:40:00.000Z	phaidros	deafboy	not sure, maybe freedos floppy ??
2007-01-22T08:41:00.000Z	deafboy	phaidros	beryl does suck, i removed it
2007-01-22T08:42:00.000Z	deafboy	phaidros	how would fixmbr help it? the mbr saves partition sizes?
2007-01-22T08:43:00.000Z	deafboy	phaidros	i have fglrx with x1600, cuz open source doesn't work for my card, and yes it's garbage
2007-01-22T08:43:00.000Z	phaidros	deafboy	hm, not sure <guessing> windows reads the partition data from somewhere, maybe mbr</guessing>
2007-01-22T08:43:00.000Z	deafboy	phaidros	and linux has it wrong :(
2007-01-22T08:44:00.000Z	phaidros	deafboy	maybe some fdisk or cfdisk foo might help (warning: could be that cfdisk was a ppc tool, cant remember properly, read before use!)
2007-01-22T08:44:00.000Z	deafboy	phaidros	is fdisk windows or linux, i forget
2007-01-22T08:45:00.000Z	phaidros	deafboy	oh, uhm .. then make some windows fdisk foo, maybe it corrects the tables so linux can read them properl y ;)
2007-01-22T08:45:00.000Z	phaidros	deafboy	exists for both
2007-01-22T08:46:00.000Z	deafboy	phaidros	he has an old card
2007-01-22T08:49:00.000Z	deafboy	phaidros	the x1000s cards suck in linux with current drivers
2007-01-22T08:49:00.000Z	deafboy	phaidros	whether your running xgl or not
2007-01-22T08:49:00.000Z	phaidros	deafboy	all ati cards .. even radeon modility 9000
2007-01-22T08:51:00.000Z	deafboy	phaidros	screw you ati !
2007-01-22T08:52:00.000Z	phaidros	deafboy	it sticks in the thinkpad :(
2007-01-22T08:54:00.000Z	deafboy	phaidros	think of any other places i could get help?
