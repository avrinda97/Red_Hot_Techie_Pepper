2011-12-30T23:02:00.000Z	Resistance	Decepticon	 just install wine from the repos, you don't need a "virtual unity", just install wine, and it should work (you will also need the Rosetta Stone CDs/DVDs anyways)
2011-12-30T23:02:00.000Z	Decepticon		I dont have cd.-rom
2011-12-30T23:03:00.000Z	Resistance	Decepticon	 then your question is "How do I mount DVD/CD images so I can install software from them"?
2011-12-30T23:03:00.000Z	Decepticon	Resistance	but is for the lenaguege
2011-12-30T23:03:00.000Z	Decepticon		lenguage
2011-12-30T23:03:00.000Z	Resistance	Decepticon	 the alternative is you go out, and buy a $20 USB CD/DVD reader
2011-12-30T23:03:00.000Z	Decepticon	Resistance	buuuuuuuuu! no because is for me
2011-12-30T23:03:00.000Z	Resistance	Decepticon	 for the record, I know what Rosetta Stone is, and I have it installed in both Windows and Linux on this machine

2011-12-30T23:04:00.000Z	Resistance	Decepticon	 would it be easier to talk in german to get help?  there's a german support channel:

2011-12-30T23:04:00.000Z	Decepticon		very fine but the problem is when the software tell me for the cdrom with lenguage
2011-12-30T23:04:00.000Z	Resistance	Decepticon	 we're finding it difficult to understand what you're needing
2011-12-30T23:05:00.000Z	Resistance	Decepticon	 you'd have to install the Linux language pack for the Language
