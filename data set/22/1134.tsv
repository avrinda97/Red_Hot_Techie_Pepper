2010-09-19T22:20:00.000Z	sriramoman1	collabra	scottie1 left room long ago
2010-09-19T22:20:00.000Z	collabra	sriramoman1	lol,... didn't realize he left.
2010-09-19T22:22:00.000Z	sriramoman1	collabra	it happens! i experienced a worst terror when i had acpi errors in my sister's laptop!
2010-09-19T22:23:00.000Z	collabra	sriramoman1	yeah,... i've had my fill of desperate hardware and software issues.
2010-09-19T22:24:00.000Z	collabra	sriramoman1	mainly software,.. lol.
2010-09-19T22:25:00.000Z	sriramoman1	collabra	finally i had to recompile the kernel adding some toshiba acpi patches and that was my first success on kernel compilation in an effort of 8 years! that too for this sake, when i made attempt,, it compiled in very first attempt and now it is a success story in the hat! but we ate tension for 2 weeks, thinking we may need to exchange laptop for heavy loss!!!
2010-09-19T22:26:00.000Z	sriramoman1	collabra	any software which u miss now, where i may be able to assist u?
2010-09-19T22:27:00.000Z	collabra	sriramoman1	no,... but talking about compiling kernels,... i've been using some flavor of linux for five years now and have yet to compile a kernel.
2010-09-19T22:28:00.000Z	collabra	sriramoman1	never felt or had the need to do it.
2010-09-19T22:29:00.000Z	sriramoman1	collabra	toshiba is an exception! the recent laptops have some redundant bios or something that drives it to acpi errors. anyway, the past efforts were hobbyist and academic inclined. for toshiba alone it was a necessity and it worked in first attmpt:D
2010-09-19T22:29:00.000Z	collabra	sriramoman1	right on.
2010-09-19T22:32:00.000Z	collabra	sriramoman1	i've read a bit on how to compile a kernel,... and a few of the benefits of doing so, but i've never just sat down and done it.... I'm more of a user than a 'hacker'
2010-09-19T22:33:00.000Z	collabra	sriramoman1	i know how to fix what gets broke,... and have been satisfied with that.
2010-09-19T22:33:00.000Z	sriramoman1	collabra	I've always felt daunted to compile kernels :P
