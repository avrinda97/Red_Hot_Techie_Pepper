2008-09-20T08:46:00.000Z	stickboy		ash-fox there's tutorials up for it and says it works just can't get on punkbuster servers for multi.
2008-09-20T08:47:00.000Z	stickboy		ash-fox i'm on 1.1.4 but i can't get it to work.
2008-09-20T08:48:00.000Z	stickboy		ash-fox yeah punkbuster doesn't work so can't get on servers that need it.
2008-09-20T08:48:00.000Z	stickboy		ash-fox right now i can't even get them to run for more than a few seconds.
2008-09-20T08:49:00.000Z	stickboy		ash-fox well right now neither does singleplayer so something else is wrong
2008-09-20T08:50:00.000Z	stickboy		ash-fox well i'd like to get either working but multi would be preferable.
2008-09-20T08:51:00.000Z	stickboy		ash-fox i followed http://www.fsckin.com/2008/02/21/how-to-run-call-of-duty-4-cod4-modern-combat-in-linux/ but used a different crack.
2008-09-20T08:53:00.000Z	stickboy		ash-fox i got steam to work but couldn't get fonts and hud display to work for tf2
2008-09-20T08:54:00.000Z	stickboy		ash-fox how? i might set up a vm actually.
2008-09-20T08:55:00.000Z	stickboy		ash-fox virtualbox won't work?
2008-09-20T08:55:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	stickboy	I doubt it.
2008-09-20T08:45:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	stickboy	cod4 does not work in wine, period.
2008-09-20T08:45:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	stickboy	I will tripple check for you.
2008-09-20T08:47:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	stickboy	I appologize, it's working now in appdb with wine 1.1.2 to 1.1.4
2008-09-20T08:47:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	stickboy	punkbuster is a seperate application to call of duty 4. Since it acts as a kernel driver, it probably wouldn't work, but let met check the application database.
2008-09-20T08:48:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	stickboy	according to the application database, it doesn't work at all, http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=3896
2008-09-20T08:49:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	stickboy	single player issue would be a seperate issue
2008-09-20T08:50:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	stickboy	http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=12804 there are some instructions here that might be of use.
2008-09-20T08:52:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	stickboy	I have the steam version, but I haven't tried with the recent wine releases.
2008-09-20T08:54:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	stickboy	it might be easier for you to use crossover games...
2008-09-20T08:54:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	stickboy	really, you should follow the instructions for most things on the wine application database
2008-09-20T08:55:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	stickboy	vms like qemu, vmware lack proper 3d acceleration to play games.
