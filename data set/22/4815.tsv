2007-10-01T13:48:00.000Z	blubba		Im having trouble getting the system to boot a current kernel. Ive booted up 2.6.12-9, which seems to be the last working kernel (but several others that wont boot).
2007-10-01T13:50:00.000Z	blubba		hrm :(
2007-10-01T13:52:00.000Z	blubba		I need help with booting. boots older kernel, but not new ones.
2007-10-01T13:53:00.000Z	blubba		am I just typing to myself?
2007-10-01T13:54:00.000Z	usser	blubba	do u have those kernels installed?
2007-10-01T13:55:00.000Z	blubba	usser	yes, i have several kernels that wont boot :( one that does.
2007-10-01T13:56:00.000Z	usser	blubba	do u have them in your grub menu.lst file?
2007-10-01T13:56:00.000Z	blubba	usser	yeah...
2007-10-01T13:57:00.000Z	blubba	usser	looking over /boot/grub/menu.lst ...
2007-10-01T13:57:00.000Z	usser	blubba	is there any error messages, does it hand or what?
2007-10-01T13:57:00.000Z	usser	blubba	when u hit esc on grub boot phase do u see the menu with boot options?
2007-10-01T13:58:00.000Z	blubba	usser	Ive tried a couple of the newwer kernels, and they dont always lock up in the same place. often its near the beginning (mounting file systems and stuffl)...
2007-10-01T13:58:00.000Z	usser	blubba	oh ok
2007-10-01T13:59:00.000Z	usser	blubba	well u really gotta look at the logs see whats happening there
2007-10-01T14:00:00.000Z	blubba	usser	I looked over menu.lst, didnt see anything odd..
2007-10-01T14:00:00.000Z	blubba	usser	my guess is there isnt any log entries as it usually doesnt get too far in the boot process...
2007-10-01T14:03:00.000Z	usser	blubba	well i dunno, i doesnt issue no kernel panic no nothing huh?
2007-10-01T14:04:00.000Z	blubba	usser	usually it just locks up with the boot process on the screen... often within the first few tasks...
2007-10-01T14:05:00.000Z	blubba	usser	they always load the kernel, and the ubuntu boot up screen...
2007-10-01T14:05:00.000Z	blubba	usser	and the only keyboard I have I use on another computer :( (I use synergy with several computers, 1 keyboard).
2007-10-01T14:20:00.000Z	blubba	usser	it looks like a DMA problem ? Im not sure how I can have a DMA problem with one kernel, but not another ?
2007-10-01T14:56:00.000Z	blubba	usser	my issue seems to be DMA, adding ide=nodma has the system booting. not sure why though...
