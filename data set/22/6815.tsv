2006-08-28T15:08:00.000Z	tepsipakki		I have a problem on dapper that even a plain simple .tex-file doesn't compile
2006-08-28T15:09:00.000Z	micahcowan	tepsipakki	you have the appropriate packages installed? How are you processing the .tex file?
2006-08-28T15:10:00.000Z	tepsipakki	micahcowan	yes I believe I have all the needed ones.. I'm migrating from sarge. I'm just running it as "latex test.tex"
2006-08-28T15:10:00.000Z	tepsipakki		nexus6 ~ 5256 % latex test.tex
2006-08-28T15:10:00.000Z	tepsipakki		This is TeX, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.4)
2006-08-28T15:10:00.000Z	tepsipakki		---! /var/lib/texmf/web2c/latex.fmt was written by pdfetex
2006-08-28T15:10:00.000Z	tepsipakki		(Fatal format file error; I'm stymied)
2006-08-28T15:10:00.000Z	tepsipakki		that's all
2006-08-28T15:11:00.000Z	tepsipakki		and the same problem with edgy
2006-08-28T15:11:00.000Z	micahcowan	tepsipakki	try pdflatex test.tex (which doesn't do quite the same thing...)
2006-08-28T15:11:00.000Z	tepsipakki	micahcowan	that works..
2006-08-28T15:12:00.000Z	micahcowan	tepsipakki	The difference is, that generates a pdf file, whereas plain latex would've generated a dvi file.
2006-08-28T15:13:00.000Z	micahcowan	tepsipakki	the complaint you got from tex seems to indicate that the latex format files were compiled with pdflatex, rather than latex, and their format files are not quite compatible.
2006-08-28T15:13:00.000Z	tepsipakki	micahcowan	that makes sense, how would I change that?
2006-08-28T15:15:00.000Z	tepsipakki	micahcowan	ok, I got it
2006-08-28T15:16:00.000Z	micahcowan	tepsipakki	how? I was looking into that...
2006-08-28T15:16:00.000Z	tepsipakki	micahcowan	thanks for pointing me to the right direction... we had links like pdflatex -> pdftex, latex -> tex
2006-08-28T15:16:00.000Z	micahcowan	tepsipakki	that should be correct.
2006-08-28T15:17:00.000Z	tepsipakki	micahcowan	it should? seems that the default is {latex, pdflatex} -> pdfetex
2006-08-28T15:18:00.000Z	micahcowan	tepsipakki	ah! That's unusual... but seems to be how my system is setup, and would explain why your latex was compiled that way.
2006-08-28T15:19:00.000Z	tepsipakki	micahcowan	so while tetex-bin was configured those links weren't there and pdfetex was used
2006-08-28T15:19:00.000Z	micahcowan	tepsipakki	I guess, since pdfetex is capable of generating .dvi's, it probably does so when its name isn't being prefixed with pdf. Not bad.... most distros I've seen link latex to tetex's version (/usr/bin/tex). Well, glad you got your answer.
