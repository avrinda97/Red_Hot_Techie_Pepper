2008-06-01T22:55:00.000Z	Pulseaudio	WarPriest	uhh, changing the resolution via System-Preferences didn't work?
2008-06-01T22:57:00.000Z	Pulseaudio	WarPriest	Tried installing the nvidia gpu program?
2008-06-01T22:58:00.000Z	Pulseaudio	WarPriest	go to applications->add/remove programs, search for nvidia
2008-06-01T22:58:00.000Z	Pulseaudio	WarPriest	go to applications->add/remove programs, search for nvidia and install nvidia x server settings module.
2008-06-01T22:59:00.000Z	Pulseaudio	WarPriest	try to configure your display via that nvidia x server settings program
2008-06-01T23:00:00.000Z	Pulseaudio	WarPriest	does that work for you?
2008-06-01T23:02:00.000Z	WarPriest	Pulseaudio	I have no idea. I just started using ubuntu today.
2008-06-01T23:02:00.000Z	WarPriest	Pulseaudio	I came from the Windows side.
2008-06-01T23:02:00.000Z	Pulseaudio	WarPriest	what's the problem again? you have an nvidia card and you can't change the resolution properly?
2008-06-01T23:02:00.000Z	Pulseaudio	WarPriest	it's cool, I came from the windows side some time ago.
2008-06-01T23:03:00.000Z	Pulseaudio	WarPriest	so you installed the nvidia drivers, right? try installing nvidia x server settings too
2008-06-01T23:04:00.000Z	Pulseaudio	WarPriest	that help you any?
