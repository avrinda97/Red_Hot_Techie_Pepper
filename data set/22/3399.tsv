2010-07-31T07:34:00.000Z	Annie		More port questions. ssh from Starbucks. Not port 22 cause it's blocked. Port 8080 let's say. The connection reaches my router. How does the ssh service that listens to port 22 know to listen to port 8080? Isn't port forwarding to have your inbound ports directed to the private ports?
2010-07-31T07:36:00.000Z	DasEi	Annie	you can tell ssh where to listen to (which port), set in the sshd_config /etc
2010-07-31T07:37:00.000Z	Annie	DasEi	do you know of a link to a tutorial? I just learned ssh 2 days ago trying to set up a web proxy being I'm leaving the states... And I'm running out of time to finish this set up and don't have a lot of time to learnsometing else
2010-07-31T07:38:00.000Z	DasEi	Annie	no prob, let's go :
2010-07-31T07:39:00.000Z	DasEi	Annie	gksudo gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2010-07-31T07:39:00.000Z	Annie	DasEi	got it
2010-07-31T07:39:00.000Z	DasEi	Annie	found it already ?
2010-07-31T07:40:00.000Z	Annie	DasEi	was talking to cast, told me about it but on reading more by brain melted
2010-07-31T07:40:00.000Z	DasEi	Annie	gksudo gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2010-07-31T07:41:00.000Z	Annie	DasEi	argh... sorry DasEi... My proxy server is a mac
2010-07-31T07:42:00.000Z	Annie	DasEi	but it looks like I can edit the config file easy enough.
2010-07-31T07:42:00.000Z	DasEi	Annie	erm, this is ubuntu, but config shall be same
2010-07-31T07:42:00.000Z	DasEi	Annie	and look for something similar in mac :
2010-07-31T07:43:00.000Z	Annie	DasEi	the netbook I'm taking is ubuntu... setting em up together brought me here
2010-07-31T07:44:00.000Z	Annie	DasEi	# Port 22.... that line is hashed out because it's default. But if I unhash it and put in 9050-9999, that will make ssh listen to those ports?
2010-07-31T07:45:00.000Z	DasEi	Annie	no sure about syntax in mac, one port or seperated ones should do
2010-07-31T07:46:00.000Z	Annie	DasEi	ok... I'll check on syntax. Just wanna make sure the question I'm gonna ask makes sense first. So something like 22,25-1000... would make sense on that line?
2010-07-31T07:47:00.000Z	DasEi	Annie	yesss
2010-07-31T07:47:00.000Z	Annie	DasEi	SWEET
2010-07-31T07:47:00.000Z	Annie	DasEi	thanks for your patience. Really needed it
2010-07-31T07:48:00.000Z	DasEi	Annie	there you go, but keep topic here : http://tinyurl.com/2d7xgdn
