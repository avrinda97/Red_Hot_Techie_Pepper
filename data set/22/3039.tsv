2009-06-01T06:03:00.000Z	Jamed	Kingsy101	i had that problem too, after restarting the icon was shown

2009-06-01T06:04:00.000Z	Jamed	Kingsy101	then what about changing the icon and then set it back to the original?
2009-06-01T06:05:00.000Z	Kingsy101	Jamed	- do you have to re-start every time you change the icon?
2009-06-01T06:05:00.000Z	Jamed	Kingsy101	no
2009-06-01T06:05:00.000Z	Kingsy101		alright thanks
2009-06-01T06:05:00.000Z	Kingsy101		I will try that now
2009-06-01T06:07:00.000Z	Kingsy101	Jamed	- does the icon manager in ubuntu recognise .xpm files? cos thats the file format of the icon I am trying to assign
2009-06-01T06:08:00.000Z	Jamed	Kingsy101	i think it can handle pbg and jpeg only, but maybe im wrong

2009-06-01T06:09:00.000Z	Kingsy101		hhmmmm I don't know how I would go about converting.. anyone got an idea?
