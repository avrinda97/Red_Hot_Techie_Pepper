2010-05-02T10:48:00.000Z	Zuka		all right, i've got a dual NVIDIA 8600GTS setup. i can't seem to get a working display driver for them. in the Hardware Drivers screen, there's absolutely nothing. when i installed the drivers from the nvidia site, i couldn't boot the graphical desktop, it took me straight to the console.
2010-05-02T10:49:00.000Z	Zuka		does anyone have an idea of what's going on?
2010-05-02T10:49:00.000Z	Zuka		i read somewhere that there's a bug with multi-gpu setups...
2010-05-02T10:49:00.000Z	Zuka		but i know i've gotten this working in the past
2010-05-02T10:50:00.000Z	Krionic	Zuka	I'm running the same 2 video cards. Those drivers are broken
2010-05-02T10:50:00.000Z	Zuka		do you know an alternative? i know it's worked before...
2010-05-02T10:51:00.000Z	Krionic	Zuka	alternative? switch back to hardy or jaunty? otherwise, wait. the install doesn't give me a working nvidia driver (modprobe says none installed), and a screwed up xorg.conf file.
2010-05-02T10:51:00.000Z	Zuka		oh, i'm already on jaunty
2010-05-02T10:53:00.000Z	Krionic	Zuka	so youre running into the same problem on 9.04?
2010-05-02T10:53:00.000Z	Zuka	Krionic	i believe so...
2010-05-02T10:53:00.000Z	Zuka	Krionic	i haven't tried lucid yet
2010-05-02T10:53:00.000Z	Krionic		zuka save yourself the grief and wait for them to fix the nvidia drivers for lucid. it's a mess.
2010-05-02T10:54:00.000Z	Krionic		zuka, have you run the nvidia-xconfig command yet?
2010-05-02T10:54:00.000Z	Zuka	Krionic	like i said, i've had it working before... i remember that i stopped using ubuntu for other reasons
2010-05-02T10:54:00.000Z	Zuka	Krionic	not on this install. i'm afraid to. :P
2010-05-02T10:55:00.000Z	Krionic	Zuka	don't run it with the gui up (gdm or kdm). make sure you stop it and run it from a term.
2010-05-02T10:56:00.000Z	Zuka		oh, ok.
2010-05-02T10:56:00.000Z	Krionic		under Hardy I could add an NTFS drive to my fstab and have it load with the system. Under Lucid I get an underpriviledged user error, and when I follow the instructions on the site, I get "Mount is denied because setuid and setgid root ntfs-3g is insecure". Anyone know a workaround?
2010-05-02T10:56:00.000Z	Zuka		right, how does one bring up the console?
2010-05-02T10:57:00.000Z	Zuka		oh yeah. thanks geekphreak
2010-05-02T10:57:00.000Z	Zuka		lol, what is the command to kill gdm?
2010-05-02T10:57:00.000Z	Krionic	Zuka	I usually Alt+Ctl+2, log in, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop (kdm if you're running KDE). then run nvidia-xconfig. then, restart your system.
