2008-04-14T15:51:00.000Z	DeFi		can someone atleast tell me where i can ask for help?
2008-04-14T15:51:00.000Z	ikonia	DeFi	what's up
2008-04-14T15:52:00.000Z	DeFi		I'm trying to find a simple way to boot an iso from a usb flash drive using some bootloader
2008-04-14T15:52:00.000Z	ikonia	DeFi	hthats not simple
2008-04-14T15:52:00.000Z	ikonia		thats not simple
2008-04-14T15:52:00.000Z	DeFi		well i need a way
2008-04-14T15:53:00.000Z	DeFi		cause cdshell can boot from an iso, but cdshell cannot run on a usb flash drive
2008-04-14T15:53:00.000Z	ikonia	DeFi	thats reasonable, but it's not an easy task
2008-04-14T15:53:00.000Z	ikonia	DeFi	I don't think grub can handle booting ISO's
2008-04-14T15:53:00.000Z	ikonia	DeFi	you'd need to uncompress it on the fly
2008-04-14T15:53:00.000Z	DeFi		no, it cant
2008-04-14T15:54:00.000Z	DeFi		how would uncompressing it help?
2008-04-14T15:54:00.000Z	ikonia	DeFi	because grub could read it as a file system
2008-04-14T15:55:00.000Z	DeFi		cdshell can only use the ISO9660 file system
2008-04-14T15:56:00.000Z	ikonia	DeFi	then this is nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-04-14T15:56:00.000Z	DeFi	ikonia	thats why i asked if you could tell me where i could ask for help with this :/
2008-04-14T15:57:00.000Z	ikonia	DeFi	no idea, again nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-04-14T15:57:00.000Z	DeFi		:(
2008-04-14T15:58:00.000Z	DeFi	ikonia	i thought someone here could just point me in the right direction after reading http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/1652/
2008-04-14T15:58:00.000Z	DeFi		oh well
2008-04-14T15:58:00.000Z	DeFi		thanks anyway
2008-04-14T15:58:00.000Z	ikonia	DeFi	bye
