2010-12-31T21:31:00.000Z	complete		Good Evening Ubuntu! Before 2010 finally dies, i have a question: Whats a good way to find all files that contain the word "cheese" but not the word "coke"?
2010-12-31T21:32:00.000Z	Gnea	complete	find / -name "*cheese*"
2010-12-31T21:33:00.000Z	Gnea	complete	just ignore iLinux, he's just a noob
2010-12-31T21:35:00.000Z	Gnea	complete	if you want to get nitty-gritty, find / -name "*cheese*" | grep -v coke
2010-12-31T21:36:00.000Z	complete	Gnea	that will not produce a list of files that contain cheese but no coke
2010-12-31T21:36:00.000Z	Gnea	complete	yes, it will.
2010-12-31T21:38:00.000Z	complete	Gnea	first of all, it will look for files with "cheese" in the name. not files with cheese in the file.
2010-12-31T21:38:00.000Z	Gnea	complete	the way you asked the question, it sounded like you were looking for cheese and not coke only in the filenames, not within the files themselves, therefore the solution is sound
2010-12-31T21:39:00.000Z	complete	Gnea	within the file.
2010-12-31T21:39:00.000Z	complete	Gnea	read my question. "Whats a good way to find all files that contain the word". Im very precisely when it comes to words. Im a nerd, you know.
2010-12-31T21:42:00.000Z	Gnea	complete	aah, in that case:  find / -type f -exec grep cheese {} \; | grep -v coke
2010-12-31T21:44:00.000Z	complete	Gnea	that will search for lines that contain cheese but not coke. im searching for files.
2010-12-31T21:44:00.000Z	Gnea	complete	feel free to troll elsewhere.
2010-12-31T21:44:00.000Z	complete	Gnea	your line will spit out lines that contain cheese but not coke.
2010-12-31T21:44:00.000Z	Gnea	complete	man grep  while you're at it
2010-12-31T21:45:00.000Z	complete	Gnea	you dont get it. believe me, you are more noob then me.
2010-12-31T21:45:00.000Z	complete	Gnea	here is a solution using awk: find . -type f -exec awk '/cheese/{f=1}/coke/{c=1;exit}END{exit !f ||c }' {} \; -print
2010-12-31T21:45:00.000Z	complete	Gnea	but i would prefer grep. if there is an easy solution.
2010-12-31T21:46:00.000Z	Gnea	complete	it's like I said, man grep
2010-12-31T21:46:00.000Z	complete	Gnea	i dont think there is an easy solution with grep.
2010-12-31T21:47:00.000Z	Gnea	complete	there never is when you're unwilling to do any real work and rely on others to do things for you.
2010-12-31T21:48:00.000Z	Gnea	complete	usually it isn't so bad, but when you go out of your way like that...
