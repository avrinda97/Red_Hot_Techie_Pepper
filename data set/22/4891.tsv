2007-10-10T09:45:00.000Z	dwf_starband		ok, I dont have windows installed on this computer so I cant determin that, but its not limited to captured video, all video seems to stop working, at least mpg and avi files
2007-10-10T09:46:00.000Z	dwf_starband		yes, I think so, since i started getting mythtv set up is when I noticed it
2007-10-10T09:47:00.000Z	bexamous	dwf_starband	I had that happen like years ago... it was the nvidia driver that would screw up
2007-10-10T09:47:00.000Z	dwf_starband	bexamous	what was your solution?
2007-10-10T09:48:00.000Z	bexamous		I think it only happened if i switched consoles or something, it eventually got fixed by updating nvidia driver... but that was long ago
2007-10-10T09:49:00.000Z	bexamous		if you use like mplayer -vo=xv filewhatever it still is all green?
2007-10-10T09:50:00.000Z	dwf_starband	bexamous	would reinstalling the nvidia drivers help at all?
2007-10-10T09:50:00.000Z	bexamous		no idea
2007-10-10T09:50:00.000Z	bexamous		try different video outs with mplayer
2007-10-10T09:50:00.000Z	bexamous		xv is optimal but see if any do it
2007-10-10T09:50:00.000Z	dwf_starband		what do you mean different video outs?
2007-10-10T09:51:00.000Z	bexamous		mplayer can use differnt video output drivers
2007-10-10T09:52:00.000Z	dwf_starband		ok, how do I select different ones?
2007-10-10T09:54:00.000Z	bexamous		Gentoo = work
2007-10-10T09:54:00.000Z	bexamous		I just gavei t up after like 4 years i think
2007-10-10T09:54:00.000Z	bexamous		too much work lol
2007-10-10T09:57:00.000Z	dwf_starband	bexamous	i selected x11 output and that worked
2007-10-10T09:57:00.000Z	dwf_starband		what does that mean?
2007-10-10T09:58:00.000Z	bexamous		x11 is 'slower' than xv
2007-10-10T09:58:00.000Z	bexamous		xv is hardware accelerated
2007-10-10T09:59:00.000Z	bexamous		if xv isn't working but x11 does its something screwy with the driver your using
2007-10-10T09:59:00.000Z	dwf_starband	bexamous	ok, the video driver?
