2010-09-29T01:40:00.000Z	TomTom34		hello
2010-09-29T01:40:00.000Z	TomTom34		can anyone hear me
2010-09-29T01:41:00.000Z	TomTom34		am I still invisible
2010-09-29T01:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	TomTom34	no
2010-09-29T01:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	TomTom34	5% of space is reserved for root
2010-09-29T01:43:00.000Z	TomTom34	erUSUL	so 8 gigs not enough for uploading any data ?
2010-09-29T01:44:00.000Z	TomTom34	erUSUL	if 5% is for root, then there should be 35gig free ?
2010-09-29T01:45:00.000Z	TomTom34	erUSUL	the drive is 700 gig
2010-09-29T01:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	TomTom34	what error do you get when you try to copy the data?
2010-09-29T01:48:00.000Z	TomTom34	erUSUL	its something else, says cannot upload data
2010-09-29T01:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	TomTom34	and you are sure is becouse of space issues? may be some other error with that "something else"
2010-09-29T01:52:00.000Z	TomTom34	erUSUL	I want to know how this disk usage thing mean, is it reserved space by the OS, can it be expanded, now it shows 100% full
2010-09-29T01:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	TomTom34	i just fired up the disk use analizer. usage is the percent of the total space used that corresponds to each folder
2010-09-29T01:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	TomTom34	as far as i can see
2010-09-29T02:00:00.000Z	TomTom34	erUSUL	is there anyplace I can upload my image file ?
2010-09-29T02:04:00.000Z	TomTom34	erUSUL	says image type not allowed, it has 2000 limit on total images in the server
2010-09-29T02:04:00.000Z	TomTom34	erUSUL	its only 100kb png image
2010-09-29T02:07:00.000Z	TomTom34	erUSUL	http://imagebin.org/116156
2010-09-29T02:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	TomTom34	that's a single disk in a single partition? it looks simply full
2010-09-29T02:09:00.000Z	TomTom34	erUSUL	so the only solution is to get a new one or delete more files ?
2010-09-29T02:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	TomTom34	so it seesms you have a folder with 460 GiB and another with 210 GiB thats 80% of the disk ....
2010-09-29T02:26:00.000Z	TomTom34	erUSUL	yeah maybe thats one of the reasons
