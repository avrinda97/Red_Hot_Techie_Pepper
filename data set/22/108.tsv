2012-07-09T20:22:00.000Z	kristenbb		I didn't mean for svn to depend on gnome-keyring
2012-07-09T20:22:00.000Z	kristenbb		I didn't set it that way
2012-07-09T20:23:00.000Z	kristenbb		as a matter of fact I didn't do anything, I installed subversion just a few minutes ago. That's how it came, broken
2012-07-09T20:24:00.000Z	kristenbb		well with gnome keyring it seems to work indeed
2012-07-09T20:24:00.000Z	kristenbb		it just opened a window asking me to save my password
2012-07-09T20:24:00.000Z	kristenbb		I don't want this
2012-07-09T20:25:00.000Z	kristenbb		it's not safe, it says so itself. ATTENTION!  Your password for authentication realm can only be stored unencrypted, blablabla
2012-07-09T20:25:00.000Z	kristenbb		I don't a keyring, I don't even know what it is
2012-07-09T20:25:00.000Z	kristenbb		keeping the password in my mind is fine by me, no need to put it somewhere obscure on the computer
2012-07-09T20:26:00.000Z	kristenbb		how can I disable this, if removing gnome-keyring brakes svn ?
2012-07-09T20:26:00.000Z	gutgut	kristenbb	saw the link?

2012-07-09T20:26:00.000Z	kristenbb	gutgut	I am reading it at the same time, but didn't finish it yet, sorry for being so
2012-07-09T20:27:00.000Z	gutgut		slow? it's one line to read.. ._.
2012-07-09T20:28:00.000Z	gutgut		no
2012-07-09T20:28:00.000Z	kristenbb		my computer is slow specially for https, but that's another issue :)
2012-07-09T20:28:00.000Z	gutgut		wat
2012-07-09T20:30:00.000Z	gutgut		OWNED LOL
2012-07-09T20:31:00.000Z	kristenbb	gutgut	so how can I remove it, it doesn't say explicitly ? Am I supposed to leave it as 'password-stores' or 'password-stores =' or something else ?
2012-07-09T20:31:00.000Z	gutgut	kristenbb	try to remove the value only
2012-07-09T20:31:00.000Z	kristenbb		so leaving the '=' ?
2012-07-09T20:32:00.000Z	gutgut	kristenbb	leave "password-stores ="
