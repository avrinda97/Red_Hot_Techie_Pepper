2009-07-14T20:31:00.000Z	tyler_d		how do I find out the exact time of a reboot via terminal?
2009-07-14T20:32:00.000Z	grawity	tyler_d	'last' maybe?
2009-08-28T21:23:00.000Z	grawity	tyler_d	Try using pool.sks-keyservers.net instead.
2009-08-28T21:23:00.000Z	grawity	tyler_d	also, the server name starts with 'keyserver', not 'keystore'
2009-10-28T22:14:00.000Z	grawity	tyler_d	Nope, it's just much _easier_ to manage several config files instead of one huge .conf
2009-10-28T22:11:00.000Z	grawity	tyler_d	technically, a2ensite just creates a symlink from apache2/sites-available to apache2/sites-enabled
2009-10-28T22:12:00.000Z	tyler_d	grawity	so what advantage does that serve?
2009-10-28T22:12:00.000Z	grawity	tyler_d	You don't need one huge apache2.conf?
2009-10-28T22:13:00.000Z	tyler_d	grawity	but ln -s would perform the same as this? no?
2009-10-28T22:13:00.000Z	grawity	tyler_d	I think it would.
2009-10-28T22:14:00.000Z	tyler_d	grawity	k... just making sure.... and otherwise, heaven forbit you use an extra few Kb on your config folder.... ;)
2009-10-28T22:15:00.000Z	grawity	tyler_d	Nope
2009-10-28T22:15:00.000Z	grawity	tyler_d	ifconfig only shows the IP address assigned to your network card.
2009-10-28T22:16:00.000Z	grawity	tyler_d	Which almost always is the LAN address.
2009-10-28T22:16:00.000Z	grawity	tyler_d	rainy-day wanted the "internet address" - the external one.
2009-10-28T22:17:00.000Z	tyler_d	grawity	fine then wget -O- "http://ipchicken.com"
2009-10-28T22:17:00.000Z	grawity	tyler_d	Thanks, I already have my methods -_-
2009-10-28T22:18:00.000Z	tyler_d	grawity	did I miss something? or did you ask that for no reason?
2009-10-28T22:18:00.000Z	grawity	tyler_d	I didn't ask, rainy-day did.
2009-10-28T22:18:00.000Z	tyler_d	grawity	sorry, that was my bad ;)
2009-10-28T22:19:00.000Z	grawity	tyler_d	Btw, for extra geek points: dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
2009-10-28T22:19:00.000Z	grawity	tyler_d	Also, it's better to use -qO- instead of -O-, easier to read output.
