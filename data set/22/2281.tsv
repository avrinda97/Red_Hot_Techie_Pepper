2009-07-30T00:48:00.000Z	johnny5_		I'm trying to get permission to my rc.local file to edit it, sksudo gedit doesn't seem to be working
2009-07-30T00:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	johnny5_	gksudo
2009-07-30T00:51:00.000Z	johnny5_	erUSUL	an admin windows apears and then disapears the program doesn't start
2009-07-30T00:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	johnny5_	tried with « sudo nano /etc/rc.local » ?
2009-07-30T00:54:00.000Z	johnny5_	erUSUL	not yet... I'll try...
2009-07-30T00:55:00.000Z	johnny5_	erUSUL	/etc/sudoers is owned by uid 33, should be 0
2009-07-30T00:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	johnny5_	:|
2009-07-30T00:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	johnny5_	you have a busted sudoers file ?
2009-07-30T00:56:00.000Z	johnny5_	erUSUL	I may have messed it up trying to get permission to it myself
2009-07-30T00:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	johnny5_	what have you doe ? changed the permission of that file ? or you did it for more files ?
2009-07-30T00:57:00.000Z	johnny5_	erUSUL	I done it to the etc directory I want access to all my files
2009-07-30T00:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	johnny5_	o.0!!!!!!!!!!!
2009-07-30T00:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	johnny5_	so your install is borked beyond repair... :|
2009-07-30T00:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	johnny5_	you will have to reinstall i'm afraid
2009-07-30T00:59:00.000Z	johnny5_	erUSUL	not all of ubunto I hope
2009-07-30T01:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	johnny5_	yes all of ubuntu... that's easier than repairing all the permissions of the hundreds files in /etc/
2009-07-30T01:03:00.000Z	johnny5_	erUSUL	I did it with 1 command?
2009-07-30T01:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	johnny5_	yep; mass changing file permissions is almost allways the worng answer in linux (specially of things under /etc/ )
2009-07-30T01:05:00.000Z	johnny5_	erUSUL	I don't have this computer backed up I have things I need.
2009-07-30T01:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	johnny5_	no repair mode as far as i know... clean install
2009-07-30T01:09:00.000Z	johnny5_	erUSUL	Can't I just change the permissions to anyone?
2009-07-30T01:12:00.000Z	johnny5_	erUSUL	will cp still work I can backup everything on a different drive.
