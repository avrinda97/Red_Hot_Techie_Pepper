2007-03-14T15:30:00.000Z	robby		but cant seem to find anything
2007-03-14T15:00:00.000Z	robby		im having a problem booting to a desktop enviro. i just installed kde and set it as my default so i would boot into kubuntu and it shows the loading screen and then goes to a terminal style login and stays in terminal
2007-03-14T15:00:00.000Z	robby		any idea how to fix it?
2007-03-14T15:01:00.000Z	robby		im booting from disc at the moment
2007-03-14T15:01:00.000Z	jrib	robby	you don't get to the login screen?
2007-03-14T15:01:00.000Z	robby	jrib	i dont get to the usual one i get to a terminal style one and it stays in terminal
2007-03-14T15:02:00.000Z	jrib	robby	check if gdm or xdm or kdm are running?
2007-03-14T15:03:00.000Z	jrib	robby	so what shows up when you go to ctrl-alt-f7 now?
2007-03-14T15:03:00.000Z	jrib	robby	switches you to where X normally runs, ctrl-alt-f1 should get you back
2007-03-14T15:03:00.000Z	jrib	robby	wait
2007-03-14T15:04:00.000Z	jrib	robby	you'll also want to check /var/log/Xorg.0.log if X is failing to start.  And try to stop kdm and then start it again and see if you get any errors:  sudo invoke-rc.d kdm stop    and to start: sudo invoke-rc.d kdm start
2007-03-14T15:05:00.000Z	jrib	robby	be sure to post that log if you come back :)
2008-03-15T06:19:00.000Z	jrib	robby	the page ubotu linked you to tells you what to do.  If after reading it you aren't sure, let me know
2008-03-15T06:24:00.000Z	jrib	robby	remove the gcjwebplugin package
2008-03-15T06:25:00.000Z	jrib	robby	I just told you
2008-03-15T06:32:00.000Z	jrib	robby	don't paste here.  Use paste.ubuntu-nl.org please
2008-03-15T06:38:00.000Z	jrib	robby	you restarted firefox?
2008-03-15T06:38:00.000Z	jrib	robby	pastebin (do not paste in the channel) the output of 'ls -l /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/'
