2008-06-19T00:24:00.000Z	peppo		where does ubuntu store settings for which DEVICE to install itself onto?
2008-06-19T00:24:00.000Z	Slart	peppo	you mean which hard drive the ubuntu files are on?
2008-06-19T00:25:00.000Z	peppo	Slart	ooops, I meant for GRUB. where it details which device's MBR to install itself onto.
2008-06-19T00:26:00.000Z	peppo	Slart	my devices described in menu.lst mismatch against bios' conception of them.
2008-06-19T00:26:00.000Z	Slart	peppo	bios loads the mbr first.. that points to a config file somewhere
2008-06-19T00:28:00.000Z	Slart	peppo	"gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst".. change it.. then "sudo update-grub"
2008-06-19T00:28:00.000Z	Slart	peppo	if you edit it right you won't have to
2008-06-19T00:29:00.000Z	peppo	Slart	but BIOS will always tell GRUB that my boot devices is "hd2,0", but Ubuntu has it wrong.
2008-06-19T00:29:00.000Z	Slart	peppo	nope.. depends on the BIOS.. you can set your BIOS to boot from any drive.. at least I can do that
2008-06-19T00:29:00.000Z	peppo	Slart	yes. that's not the problem
2008-06-19T00:29:00.000Z	peppo	Slart	even if I change the boot order, the devices are callled the same in GRUB. hd1,0 is still hd1,0 even if the boot order is changed in bios.
2008-06-19T00:30:00.000Z	Slart	peppo	yes.. and that is a problem?
2008-06-19T00:30:00.000Z	peppo	Slart	yes because GRUB makes a menu.lst with "hd2,0"
2008-06-19T00:30:00.000Z	peppo	Slart	to be able t boot off of that I need to change it to hd0,0
2008-06-19T00:30:00.000Z	Slart	peppo	then change the menu.lst
2008-06-19T00:31:00.000Z	peppo	Slart	I don't want to do that every time ubuntu updates kernels!
2008-06-19T00:31:00.000Z	peppo	Slart	it by default makes kernel entries as "hd2,0". which ends up wrong.
2008-06-19T00:31:00.000Z	Slart	peppo	I'm going to say this slowly.. edit it right and you wont have to
2008-06-19T00:31:00.000Z	Slart	peppo	read the manual?
2008-06-19T00:31:00.000Z	peppo	Slart	the BIOS has my device with Ubuntu boot partition as device 2
2008-06-19T00:33:00.000Z	Slart	peppo	check the top of the menu.lst file.. it's got the keywords for the manual
2008-06-19T00:38:00.000Z	Slart	peppo	you can reinstall grub if you want. Might be easier
