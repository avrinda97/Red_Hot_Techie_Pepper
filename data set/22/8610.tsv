2006-02-26T10:25:00.000Z	dabaR	Dr_Willis	good choice.
2009-12-24T03:15:00.000Z	dabaR	Dr_Willis	is that what they tell you?
2009-12-24T03:25:00.000Z	dabaR	Dr_Willis	looks like they won't on his system...his update-grub is the old version that overwrites menu.lst, and yet his grub reads grub.cfg
2009-12-24T03:25:00.000Z	dabaR	Dr_Willis	seen that before?
2009-12-24T03:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dabaR	 only when someone does somtning odd like instgalls grub1 some how.
2010-04-30T18:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dabaR	  You mean the use of the TAB key to nick-complete ?
2010-04-30T18:57:00.000Z	dabaR	Dr_Willis	I mean specifically that syntax, some program uses that syntax, and irssi does not highlight
2010-04-30T18:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dabaR	 depends on the irc client.  Theres probery scripts or settings to enable it. I perfer WeeChat to irssi these days
2010-04-30T18:58:00.000Z	dabaR	Dr_Willis	command line?
2010-04-30T18:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dabaR	 yes
2010-04-30T18:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dabaR	 i even got mine where i get gnome-notificatioon bubbles when someone chats at me
2010-04-30T18:59:00.000Z	dabaR	Dr_Willis	but you seem to use irc more than me. Noone ever pm's me unless I am having a convo with them. But it will still be useful
2010-04-30T19:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dabaR	 it shows when people in the chananel say my nick
2010-04-30T19:00:00.000Z	dabaR	Dr_Willis	Another important feature....
2010-04-30T19:04:00.000Z	dabaR	Dr_Willis	Looks a lot like irssi, but does not have the same commands at all
2010-04-30T19:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dabaR	 how else would you expect a text based irc client to look? :)
2010-04-30T19:06:00.000Z	dabaR	Dr_Willis	what's a good tutorial on it?
2010-04-30T19:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dabaR	 the programs homepage
2010-04-30T19:06:00.000Z	dabaR	Dr_Willis	I certainly like the use of colors, but I need to configure now...
2010-04-30T19:08:00.000Z	dabaR	Dr_Willis	OK, well, how do I ignore joins quits and all that jazz?
2010-04-30T19:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dabaR	 the quickstart/users guide tells you. I cant rember the command off hand.  it also has a 'smart ignore' feature that you want to be using.
2010-04-30T19:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dabaR	 and a 'smart part/join/quit' hide feature.
