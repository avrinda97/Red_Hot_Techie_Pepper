2008-01-08T15:55:00.000Z	Falgn0n	bazhang	- i'm not sure that's what I'm loking for - i need a billing & authentication system for a wireless hotspot, so users can buy credit online or over the counter (voucher) and log-in to the hotspot
2008-01-08T15:55:00.000Z	Falgn0n		I found "Hotcakes" at sourceforge, and I'm wonderin if i will will have problems using it if all the pc's connecting to the hotspot are windows based...
2008-01-08T15:56:00.000Z	bazhang	Falgn0n	first you need to setup the server--the rest you can do after that--there are plenty of how tos for that though might not be ubuntu related strictly speaking (though you can try) best to first set up the server though
