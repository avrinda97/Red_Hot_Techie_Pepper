2006-12-30T10:19:00.000Z	violot		We installed the -utils and -common packages
2006-12-30T10:20:00.000Z	masked	violot	cos ndiswrapper is crap
2006-12-30T10:20:00.000Z	violot		How do I get the connection then?

2006-12-30T10:20:00.000Z	masked	violot	what sort of card is it?
2006-12-30T10:20:00.000Z	masked		sioif your going to use linux, use hardware that is supported by it.
2006-12-30T10:22:00.000Z	masked		is the ipw3945 driver that is inclded with edgy from kernel sources, and/or does it use the built-in ieee 80211 stack from the kernel?
2006-12-30T10:22:00.000Z	violot	masked	I'm trying two ones, one for my friend, one for my dad (Our laptop)
2006-12-30T10:22:00.000Z	masked	violot	what are they!?
2006-12-30T10:22:00.000Z	violot		Netgear USB something (Lemme check) and Belkin 54g
2006-12-30T10:22:00.000Z	masked	violot	you need prism, atheros or orinoco chipsets.  the rest are a waste of time.
2006-12-30T10:22:00.000Z	violot		Netgear WG111 USB
2006-12-30T10:23:00.000Z	violot		*Sigh*
2006-12-30T10:23:00.000Z	masked	violot	take it in te cash converters and tell them it's worth $100
2006-12-30T10:23:00.000Z	violot	masked	it's not.  They'll just go back to Windows
2006-12-30T10:23:00.000Z	masked	violot	well, too bad.
2006-12-30T10:24:00.000Z	masked	violot	ndiswrapper is a waste of time imho.
2006-12-30T10:24:00.000Z	violot		So basically the companies are assholes for not creating Linux drivers/releasing source code...
2006-12-30T10:25:00.000Z	masked	violot	yeah, and most the other chipsets are shit anyway
