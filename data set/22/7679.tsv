2008-02-15T08:40:00.000Z	BigDaddy		evening all
2008-02-15T08:40:00.000Z	BigDaddy		Need some help getting my vista laptop to read shared folders on my Ubuntu box
2008-02-15T08:42:00.000Z	BigDaddy		When ever I am on my vista laptop and I open the network, I can see my ubuntu machine. When I enter my ubuntu username and passwird, it says it cannot connect. It also changes my username to my laptop_machine_name/ubuntu_machine_name
2008-02-15T08:42:00.000Z	cycom	BigDaddy	samba has a different un/password setup than just your linux login.
2008-02-15T08:43:00.000Z	cycom	BigDaddy	you can set them the same
2008-02-15T08:43:00.000Z	cycom	BigDaddy	as in you can set your samba passwd to your linux password, but this is sent as cleartext IIRC
2008-02-15T08:43:00.000Z	cycom	BigDaddy	I think so. Can't remember.
2008-02-15T08:44:00.000Z	cycom	BigDaddy	in any case, you set your samba passwrd with smbpasswd
2008-02-15T08:44:00.000Z	BigDaddy	cycom	so do I do that in the Ubuntu Users & groups or the Samba configuration?
2008-02-15T08:45:00.000Z	cycom	BigDaddy	smbpasswd is a command line utility. I don't know of a gui way to do this, but I'm sure there is one.
2008-02-15T08:46:00.000Z	BigDaddy	cycom	thanks. I am going to google smbpasswd and go from there
2008-02-15T08:46:00.000Z	cycom	BigDaddy	Good luck mate!
2008-02-15T08:47:00.000Z	BigDaddy	cycom	do I need to reboot or restart samba?
2008-02-15T08:47:00.000Z	cycom	BigDaddy	I don't think so.  Maybe restart samba
2008-02-15T08:47:00.000Z	cycom	BigDaddy	/etc/init.d/samba restart I think.
2008-02-15T08:50:00.000Z	BigDaddy	cycom	HOTDAMN!
2008-02-15T08:50:00.000Z	cycom	BigDaddy	it worked?
2008-02-15T08:50:00.000Z	cycom	BigDaddy	my pleasure :)
