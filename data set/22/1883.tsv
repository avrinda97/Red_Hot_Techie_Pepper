2009-12-18T05:08:00.000Z	poisonborz	epinky	how exactly? does the alternate have more drivers?
2009-12-18T05:11:00.000Z	epinky	poisonborz	something like that, can you boot with LiveCD right?
2009-12-18T05:12:00.000Z	poisonborz	epinky	yes, and the livecd os sees the hdd, but not the installer
2009-12-18T05:19:00.000Z	epinky	poisonborz	hit F6 at the boot menu and go through an unguided setup. When you scan for hard drives and enter the partition manager, don't select to enable SATA when asked
2009-12-18T05:32:00.000Z	epinky	poisonborz	you can try something before that, are you already using alternate ?
2009-12-18T05:35:00.000Z	poisonborz	epinky	I can't get the alternate cd working on a usb drive... the ultraiso app that works with the livecd is not working with the alternate iso
2009-12-18T05:36:00.000Z	epinky	poisonborz	ok, boot LiveCD
2009-12-18T05:36:00.000Z	poisonborz	epinky	umm, and then?
2009-12-18T05:37:00.000Z	poisonborz	epinky	you said i should use alternate installer
2009-12-18T05:37:00.000Z	epinky	poisonborz	yes, but we can try something before that, do you want to?
2009-12-18T05:38:00.000Z	poisonborz	epinky	sure... what should i do after booting into livecd?
2009-12-18T05:38:00.000Z	epinky	poisonborz	ok, open a terminal and type: sudo apt-get remove dmraid
2009-12-18T05:39:00.000Z	poisonborz	epinky	(please write down the process, i have to re-wire the monitor)
