2009-11-16T00:37:00.000Z	guntbert	PaulMooney	does the same happen with a different kernel?
2009-11-16T00:38:00.000Z	PaulMooney	guntbert	yes. I had the problem for a year with 8.04 on version different 2.6.11 through 2.6.19 kernels. I just upgraded to intrepid 8.10 and I still see the problem on 2.6.27-5
2009-11-16T00:39:00.000Z	PaulMooney	guntbert	it looks like 2.6.27 is using the e1000e driver instead, but I still have the same problem. one page i read said that the e1000e was meant to be a driver fix for this problem....
2009-11-16T00:40:00.000Z	guntbert	PaulMooney	I see - could it be a hardware problem (I'm on a T60 with e100e right now)
2009-11-16T00:42:00.000Z	PaulMooney	guntbert	do you have gigabit LAN? it seems to be a problem with the gigabit chip
2009-11-16T00:42:00.000Z	PaulMooney	guntbert	I would like to do a BIOS update but lenovo's site seems to be almost crashed right now.  all the support links go to page "not found"
2009-11-16T00:42:00.000Z	guntbert	PaulMooney	no - although I seem to remember to have used it directly with my nas (for performance purposes) once
2009-11-16T00:43:00.000Z	PaulMooney	guntbert	well if its the e1000e driver (1000 instead of 100) it might be gigabit
2009-11-16T00:43:00.000Z	PaulMooney	guntbert	what do you get if you do `lspci|grep Ethernet` ?
2009-11-16T00:44:00.000Z	guntbert	PaulMooney	well I'm using the e1000e, and absolutely no problems lspci gives 02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82573L Gigabit Ethernet Controller
2009-11-16T00:46:00.000Z	PaulMooney	guntbert	yup... same card it looks like....
2009-11-16T00:46:00.000Z	PaulMooney	guntbert	what kernel?
2009-11-16T00:47:00.000Z	guntbert	PaulMooney	did you try with different distros? knoppix? my kernel is 2.6.28-16-generic #55-Ubuntu SMP Tue Oct 20 19:48:32 UTC 2009 x86_64 GNU/Linux
2009-11-16T00:48:00.000Z	PaulMooney	guntbert	no i haven't. this comp has been ubuntu only for years now...
2009-11-16T00:49:00.000Z	guntbert	PaulMooney	I only suggested for testing - but now I have a question: how can you run a bios update without windows?
2009-11-16T00:50:00.000Z	PaulMooney	guntbert	they may provide an image I can burn to cdrom & then boot from it to upgrade that way.  if the website working for you?
2009-11-16T00:51:00.000Z	guntbert	PaulMooney	didn't try for quite a time
2009-11-16T00:54:00.000Z	PaulMooney	guntbert	ibuclaw: I have seen before where an image for cdrom burning was provided.  If the page would open (can anyone open it) I would be able to tell if lenovo provides this or not....
2009-11-16T01:20:00.000Z	PaulMooney	guntbert	lenovo provides the cdrom image like I thought.  I just need the site to come back up
2009-11-16T01:21:00.000Z	guntbert	PaulMooney	thx for reporting back, I'll go looking one day ...
2009-11-16T01:22:00.000Z	PaulMooney	guntbert	the info is all here: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/BIOS_Upgrade
2009-11-16T01:25:00.000Z	guntbert	PaulMooney	thx, it seems that was the *one* page I didn't find :-)
