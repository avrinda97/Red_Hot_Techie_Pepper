2009-05-22T23:47:00.000Z	mib_am0tnx		Hi, I have a question about un-installing Ubuntu.... long story short, I have a disk image of my previous XP installation, on a separate hard drive.... Can I just pop in the Ghost CD and reimage this hard drive (there are no partitions other than Ubuntu, I think), and it will bring me back to where I was?
2009-05-22T23:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	why you want to get rid of Ubuntu?
2009-05-22T23:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	that kind of thing can be set up in a Linux distro as well
2009-05-22T23:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	you can set up Internet filters and so on
2009-05-22T23:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	don't give up
2009-05-22T23:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	most of the Internet runs on Linux :)
2009-05-22T23:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	quite a few companies and so on are going Linux
2009-05-22T23:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	on there networks etc
2009-05-22T23:51:00.000Z	mib_am0tnx	sebsebseb	I know, that's why I wanted to switch! Yet, I need a solution, like, now.
2009-05-22T23:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	try finding one in ##linux
2009-05-22T23:52:00.000Z	mib_am0tnx	sebsebseb	that's another IRC channel?
2009-05-22T23:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	yes
2009-05-22T23:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	and a general Linux one
2009-05-22T23:53:00.000Z	mib_am0tnx	sebsebseb	OK, thanks! If I don't find anything, can I just stick in the ghost CD and reimage? Just point the destination to my main drive? There are no partitions except those that Ubuntu generates, if any
2009-05-22T23:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	yes I assume so, but  you want to get away from Windows :)
2009-05-22T23:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	and I know what you want to do can be done, I just don't have the details
2009-05-22T23:53:00.000Z	mib_am0tnx	sebsebseb	OK, great - thanks!
2009-05-22T23:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	now there will be a bit of a learning curve for what you want to do,  you will have to use commands and such probably
2009-05-22T23:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	,but  if you don't give up, the results should be rather good :)
2009-05-23T00:06:00.000Z	mib_am0tnx	sebsebseb	so I just reimage, basically, and don't worry about partitions?
2009-05-23T00:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	yeah just delete the partitions, or use Ghost
2009-05-23T00:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mib_am0tnx	that should do it
