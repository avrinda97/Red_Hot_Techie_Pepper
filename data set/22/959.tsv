2011-11-08T08:19:00.000Z	javier_		Hi, in ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10 internet wireless conection is slow, while it's fast under windows in the same computer. Please, someone has an idea what could I do? Thanks1
2011-11-08T08:19:00.000Z	bandit5432	javier_	what card is it?
2011-11-08T08:21:00.000Z	javier_	bandit5432	Hi. I think it's an atheros. But, to be sure, can you tell me how can I ask that in terminal?
2011-11-08T08:22:00.000Z	javier_	bandit5432	I checked. My cards are : Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetLink BCM57780 Gigabit Ethernet PCIe (rev 01)
2011-11-08T08:22:00.000Z	javier_	bandit5432	so, it's wireless problem, it's atheros
2011-11-08T08:26:00.000Z	bandit5432	javier_	you are not alone in this issue
2011-11-08T08:27:00.000Z	javier_	bandit5432	really? you found posts with people in the same situation? Did they find anything to solve it?
2011-11-08T08:28:00.000Z	bandit5432	javier_	try in a terminal echo "options ath9k nohwcrypt=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf
2011-11-08T08:29:00.000Z	bandit5432	javier_	see this post http://askubuntu.com/questions/40876/how-do-i-get-an-atheros-ar9287-working
2011-11-08T08:29:00.000Z	javier_	bandit5432	options ath9k nohwcrypt=1
2011-11-08T08:30:00.000Z	javier_	bandit5432	ok, i'll read that
2011-11-08T08:30:00.000Z	bandit5432	javier_	yes add it to /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf
2011-11-08T08:33:00.000Z	javier_	bandit5432	truth is, I don't really understand what am I doing. Shall I just write "echo "options ath9k nohwcrypt=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/ath9.conf"?
2011-11-08T08:33:00.000Z	javier_	bandit5432	and it will add that line to "etc/modprobe.d/...?
2011-11-08T08:34:00.000Z	bandit5432	javier_	echo "options ath9k nohwcrypt=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf
2011-11-08T08:34:00.000Z	bandit5432	javier_	will
2011-11-08T08:36:00.000Z	javier_	bandit5432	ok, I did that. But terminal stayed like it's doing something and didn't finish. That state that goes to a new line but there is nothing written. And if you try to close terminal, it ask you if you really want to close because something is running. Is it ok?
2011-11-08T08:38:00.000Z	bandit5432	javier_	should be you need to reboot and see if it helps
2011-11-08T08:43:00.000Z	javier_	bandit5432	ey, I did it and it seems it works much better. I would have to try it longer and see if it really changed, but it seems better :) So, thanks!
2011-11-08T08:43:00.000Z	bandit5432	javier_	no problem
2011-11-08T08:44:00.000Z	javier_	bandit5432	 :)
2011-11-08T08:44:00.000Z	bandit5432	javier_	you to
