2011-06-14T21:05:00.000Z	researcher123		is it possible to install windows after fully utilising the only hard disk with Ubuntu 11.04?
2011-06-14T21:05:00.000Z	rationalOgre	researcher123	You will nuke your ubuntu install.
2011-06-14T21:06:00.000Z	researcher123	rationalOgre	I want to retain Ubuntu also
2011-06-14T21:06:00.000Z	rationalOgre	researcher123	I believe you need to install windows prior to installing ubuntu to make it work properly. It's been awhile since I have done a dual-boot
2011-06-14T21:08:00.000Z	rationalOgre	researcher123	I stand corrected, you can put windows on after Ubuntu, but you need to repartition the drive so that the first partition is where windows will be installed.
2011-06-14T21:09:00.000Z	rationalOgre	researcher123	Then, after installing XP you will need to recover the boot loader.

2011-06-14T21:09:00.000Z	researcher123	rationalOgre	but how to creat space to install XP?
2011-06-14T21:11:00.000Z	rationalOgre	researcher123	You will need to boot into the livecd and move your partitions using gparted or the Disk Utility in Ubuntu.
2011-06-14T21:11:00.000Z	researcher123	rationalOgre	Yes I have a live USB. But will it have gparted on it?
2011-06-14T21:12:00.000Z	rationalOgre	researcher123	yes.
2011-06-14T21:13:00.000Z	researcher123	rationalOgre	thats nice.But then what happens to grub when I will install XP on the created space?
2011-06-14T21:14:00.000Z	rationalOgre	researcher123	XP will wipe out grub
2011-06-14T21:14:00.000Z	rationalOgre	researcher123	So once you have XP installed, you will have to recover grub.
2011-06-14T21:14:00.000Z	rationalOgre	researcher123	Which that link i gave you talks about doing.
2011-06-14T21:14:00.000Z	researcher123	rationalOgre	Yes I know only that much.But then how to get it back in order?
2011-06-14T21:15:00.000Z	rationalOgre	researcher123	Read the link i gave several times.
2011-06-14T21:15:00.000Z	rationalOgre	researcher123	The whole thing. It has a summation towards the bottom.
2011-06-14T21:16:00.000Z	researcher123	rationalOgre	is it this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot?

2011-06-14T21:17:00.000Z	rationalOgre	researcher123	If you find for whatever reason that gparted isn't available on your liveusb, just run "sudo apt-get install gparted"
2011-06-14T21:17:00.000Z	rationalOgre	researcher123	the liveusb is capable of installing software to it's tmpfs
