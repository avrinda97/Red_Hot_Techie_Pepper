2010-06-04T01:31:00.000Z	davidthedrake		Hello. I'm running Ubuntu installed through Wubi and dual-booting. I recently upgraded my version of Ubuntu and now I cannot get back in. It appears that my grub configuration has just been wiped out or something. Can anyone assist?
2010-06-04T01:33:00.000Z	acerimmer	davidthedrake	grub changed versions at 9.10 and screwed wubi good.  perhaps it's time to consider a proper dual boot??
2010-06-04T01:34:00.000Z	davidthedrake	acerimmer	that sounds like a decent option but I still need to get back into my current installation. Do you know how I might achieve that and what should I look for to set up a more "proper" dual boot?
2010-06-04T01:34:00.000Z	acerimmer	davidthedrake	well, strongly suspect your update trashed the mbr.  *should* be able to recover that.  wait one
2010-06-04T01:35:00.000Z	davidthedrake	acerimmer	thanks much.
2010-06-04T01:37:00.000Z	acerimmer	davidthedrake	describe the boot failure exactly what happens
2010-06-04T01:38:00.000Z	davidthedrake	acerimmer	I boot up. I get the OS selection screen. I select Ubuntu. It goes to a prompt with a Grub title above it.
2010-06-04T01:38:00.000Z	acerimmer	davidthedrake	and then hangs??
2010-06-04T01:38:00.000Z	davidthedrake	acerimmer	no, doesn't hang.
2010-06-04T01:38:00.000Z	davidthedrake	acerimmer	I can enter grub commands
2010-06-04T01:39:00.000Z	davidthedrake	acerimmer	I'm not familiar enough with grub syntax to know what needs to be done to get things booted up to a prompt where I can restore.
2010-06-04T01:39:00.000Z	acerimmer	davidthedrake	so it drops you out of boot to a grub menu??
2010-06-04T01:39:00.000Z	davidthedrake	acerimmer	yes. I select ubuntu and it just goes straight to a basic grub menu with a prompt.
2010-06-04T01:39:00.000Z	acerimmer	davidthedrake	ok tht's actually not bad.  looks like your kernel updates and what not got scrambled
2010-06-04T01:40:00.000Z	davidthedrake	acerimmer	yea, I don't think anything really terrible has happened. It just looks like my grub configuration was messed up and I just don't know how to recover it w/out actually getting a terminal
2010-06-04T01:40:00.000Z	acerimmer	davidthedrake	you're going to terminal.  deal with it.
2010-06-04T01:41:00.000Z	acerimmer	davidthedrake	OR uou're looking at reinstalling
2010-06-04T01:41:00.000Z	davidthedrake	acerimmer	perhaps you misunderstood me. I'm not worried about going to terminal. But, w/out getting at least a gnome session running to do a grub-update or something, I'm not sure how to proceed. Jordan_U checking now
2010-06-04T01:42:00.000Z	acerimmer	davidthedrake	jordan is quite good and probably has the correct tutorial close at hand.  work with him and good luck
2010-06-04T01:42:00.000Z	davidthedrake	acerimmer	thanks much for your help :)
2010-06-04T01:44:00.000Z	davidthedrake	acerimmer	no, there appears to be a bug with a patched file that I'm going to try to apply
2010-06-04T01:49:00.000Z	davidthedrake	acerimmer	thanks for your help as well :)
