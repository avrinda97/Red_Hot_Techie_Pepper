2007-06-09T08:30:00.000Z	bruenig	atlantis	archlinux
2007-06-09T08:33:00.000Z	bruenig	atlantis	there won't be for 4 more months because of the discrete release model
2007-07-15T07:28:00.000Z	bruenig	atlantis	use a lighter distro
2007-07-15T07:29:00.000Z	bruenig	atlantis	there are lighter distros
2007-07-15T07:30:00.000Z	bruenig	atlantis	zenwalk, dsl, puppy
2007-07-15T07:30:00.000Z	bruenig	atlantis	zenwalk is nice, get that
2007-07-15T07:32:00.000Z	bruenig	atlantis	hp drivers are super easy, ubuntu hasn't done anything that any other distro hasn't done as far as that is concerned
2007-07-15T07:33:00.000Z	bruenig	atlantis	hplip and cups, that is the secret formula
2007-07-15T07:34:00.000Z	bruenig	atlantis	I know it is on zenwalk, zenwalk actually has better setup than zenwalk on printer because it uses the gnome-cups-add thing just like regular ubuntu
2007-07-15T07:34:00.000Z	bruenig	atlantis	than xubuntu*
2007-07-15T07:38:00.000Z	bruenig	atlantis	it's a pidgin so....?
