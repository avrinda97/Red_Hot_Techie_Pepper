2011-02-27T13:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LXCC-Vincenzo	 you see no LDM (gui) login screen? or is it there but not letting you login?
2011-02-27T13:34:00.000Z	LXCC-Vincenzo	Dr_Willis	i can see the LDM, but when i try to enter with my login-password, i cannot enter
2011-02-27T13:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LXCC-Vincenzo	 as a 'test' you could stop ldm with 'sudo service ldm stop' (from a console) then try 'startx' and see if that gets  you to the desktop
2011-02-27T13:42:00.000Z	LXCC-Vincenzo	Dr_Willis	I tryied, it says: "ldm: unrecognized service"
2011-02-27T13:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LXCC-Vincenzo	 if you are useing 'gdm' try gdm, if kdm, try kdm. just make sure your 'login screen' service is not running befor you try the startx command.
2011-02-27T13:48:00.000Z	LXCC-Vincenzo	Dr_Willis	with ctrl+alt+f7 i can see login screen of Lubuntu, but in text mode, using ps aux, i not see ldm or gdm or kdm, do you want see the entire ps aux?
2011-02-27T13:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LXCC-Vincenzo	 you may want to ask in #lubuntu how to stop their login service. I thought it was ldm. it may be called somthing differntly
2011-02-27T13:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LXCC-Vincenzo	 you could look in /etc/init/ and see if theres a gdm.conf or ldm.conf of somthingelseDM.conf it may be using.
2011-02-27T13:53:00.000Z	LXCC-Vincenzo	Dr_Willis	found lxdm, i'll try to stop it
2011-02-27T13:56:00.000Z	LXCC-Vincenzo	Dr_Willis	found ok stopped lxdm, using startx (without sudo) there is this error "Error from xkbcomp are not fatal to the X server
2011-02-27T14:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LXCC-Vincenzo	 so 'startx' is not even working for the user?
2011-02-27T14:10:00.000Z	LXCC-Vincenzo	Dr_Willis	yes, startx not work for the user
2011-02-27T14:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LXCC-Vincenzo	 as a second 'test' try making a new user. 'sudo adduser billgates' (or whoever) and login ont ot he console as them.. see if startx works for them.
2011-02-27T14:13:00.000Z	LXCC-Vincenzo	Dr_Willis	i've created new user but startx not work
2011-02-27T14:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LXCC-Vincenzo	  thats a sign of a deeper systemissue. not just a user setting. :( that can be much harder to figure out.
2011-02-27T14:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LXCC-Vincenzo	 are you getting any sctual error messages with it? what does startx do exactly when youy try it.
2011-02-27T14:24:00.000Z	LXCC-Vincenzo	Dr_Willis	sorry for delay, i'm trying to create a paste of errors
2011-02-27T14:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LXCC-Vincenzo	 the 'pastebin' command does wonders. :)
2011-02-27T14:36:00.000Z	LXCC-Vincenzo	Dr_Willis	this is the error http://paste.ubuntu.com/572993/
2011-02-27T14:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LXCC-Vincenzo	 as another test try just running 'X' see if it has a dixplay with a X cursor..  somting seems really weird here.
2011-02-27T14:43:00.000Z	LXCC-Vincenzo	Dr_Willis	when i use startx , there is no X cursor. there is only a line in black screen for a moment and after that message appear
2011-02-27T15:23:00.000Z	LXCC-Vincenzo	Dr_Willis	no other ideas?
