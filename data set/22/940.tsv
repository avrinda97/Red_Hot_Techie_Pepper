2011-01-12T05:51:00.000Z	minimec	skilz	Looks like you are mixing some ubuntu distributions or have a incomplete repository.
2011-01-12T05:52:00.000Z	skilz	minimec	How may I fix my incomplete repository?
2011-01-12T05:52:00.000Z	skilz	minimec	Or check if I mixed some ubuntu distros
2011-01-12T05:54:00.000Z	minimec	skilz	If you want to create a new sources.list, check out that... http://repogen.simplylinux.ch/
2011-01-12T05:57:00.000Z	skilz	minimec	should I tick everything sources too?
2011-01-12T06:00:00.000Z	minimec	skilz	in 'updates' ubuntu default is 'security updates' and 'recommended updates' (the first two), check everything in 'branches'
2011-01-12T06:00:00.000Z	skilz	minimec	yeah but I am limited to what software I can install them
2011-01-12T06:01:00.000Z	minimec	skilz	Check your settings in Synaptics and use the same with the new list.
2011-07-02T18:31:00.000Z	minimec	skilz	If using a GUI you might have conflict with an eventually loaded nm-applet. maybe 'killall nm-applet' first.
