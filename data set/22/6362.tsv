2007-01-12T16:18:00.000Z	stefg	Jordan_U	do yu have a source-doc fot the parameters on dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg? I'll be interested in alink
2007-01-12T16:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stefg	I don't think there are any package specific parameters so man dpkg-reconfigure should give you all the info you want
2007-07-08T16:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stefg	gksudo for GUI apps
2007-07-08T16:42:00.000Z	stefg	Jordan_U	ubuntus sudo is smart enough to inherit the X env now :-)
2007-07-08T16:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stefg	Do you know that or do you say that just because it works with some apps? ( sudo )
2007-07-08T16:45:00.000Z	stefg	Jordan_U	!grub | ahlibyte
2007-07-08T16:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stefg	Do you know that or do you say that just because it works with some apps? ( sudo )
2007-07-08T16:47:00.000Z	stefg	Jordan_U	the ubuntu devs are well aware that there might be clueless users, so sudo works with most gnome apps and over ssh -X. although from an orthodox point of view it's still gksudo, this sloppiness is tolerated
2007-07-08T16:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stefg	If the page linked to from !gksudo is correct then that sloppiness could get people into trouble if they use one of the few apps that won't work with sudo
2007-07-08T16:49:00.000Z	stefg	Jordan_U	if they don't know the difference, they probably shouldn't use the apps whicj require proper gksudo :-)
2007-07-08T16:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stefg	Still, it is a bad habit to get into
2007-07-08T06:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stefg	Would you like to help cozierfamily? :)
2007-07-12T14:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stefg	Really? That is pretty bad practice.
2007-07-19T16:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stefg	But having it mounted and using find from grub is the easiest way to be sure of the correct partition ( /dev/whatever != (hdx,x) )
2007-07-19T16:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stefg	Oh, you don't even need it mounted to do that?
2007-07-19T16:04:00.000Z	stefg	Jordan_U	no, as said earlier. grub lives in its own universe
2007-07-20T11:29:00.000Z	stefg	Jordan_U	nitrocks : ntfsfix is no check, it just makes the drive look as if it had been checked. That's just a last resort
2007-07-20T11:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stefg	Ahh, didn't realize
2007-09-06T16:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stefg	"job control turned off" error is my guess
2007-09-23T15:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stefg	Stupid in what way?
2007-09-23T15:09:00.000Z	stefg	Jordan_U	swap space is a /shared/ resource on most computers which do run more that one distro .... swap space UUIDs are futile, and the whole idea doesn't work out
2012-05-05T11:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	stefg	While "su" (without any username) would default to running a shell and "sudo" would default to running the command passed to it, gksu and gksudo both always ran only a command and never started a root shell (which wouldn't make much sense in a GUI context). gksu defaults to using sudo in Ubuntu so that they could be compatible with upstream .desktop files for GUI applications that ran as root.
