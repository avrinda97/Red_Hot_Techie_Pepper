2007-10-28T23:27:00.000Z	darkdebian		who have troubles with network-manager in gutsy??
2007-10-28T23:28:00.000Z	mindrape	darkdebian	- if we had troubles with it we'd ask a specific question about our troubles.  Do you have a specific trouble?
2007-10-28T23:28:00.000Z	mindrape	darkdebian	- well ask a good well structured question and we will try to help.
2007-10-28T23:31:00.000Z	mindrape	darkdebian	- you seem new here and I am trying to be patient so let me give you my perspective on your question...
2007-10-28T23:32:00.000Z	mindrape	darkdebian	- lets do a little analogy... your life is "linux" and your wife is "the network problem"
2007-10-28T23:33:00.000Z	darkdebian	mindrape	mi wife is network-manager :-P
2007-10-28T23:33:00.000Z	mindrape	darkdebian	- just an analogy  ;)  I surely hope she is more to you than just a network manager
2007-10-28T23:33:00.000Z	darkdebian	mindrape	;-)
2007-10-28T23:37:00.000Z	darkdebian	mindrape	- how can I get information about the state of network, network manager, and dbus??
2007-10-28T23:37:00.000Z	mindrape	darkdebian	- what specific network information do you want?
2007-10-28T23:37:00.000Z	mindrape	darkdebian	- packets sent/received?  IP address?  Subnet?
2007-10-28T23:38:00.000Z	darkdebian	mindrape	- If the cable is plugged in
2007-10-28T23:39:00.000Z	darkdebian	mindrape	- because only say "Manual configuration..." and not say Wired connection and my dial-up pppoe connections
2007-10-28T23:42:00.000Z	darkdebian	mindrape	- what can I do?
2007-10-28T23:48:00.000Z	darkdebian	mindrape	- what can I do?
2007-10-29T00:06:00.000Z	darkdebian	mindrape	- please, dont forgett my problem
2007-10-29T00:06:00.000Z	mindrape	darkdebian	- I never did understand your problem.  ;)
2007-10-29T00:09:00.000Z	mindrape	darkdebian	- finishing up lunch here and then going to the gym and then off to the store to get some stuff for the house.
