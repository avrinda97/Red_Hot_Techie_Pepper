2010-10-03T14:55:00.000Z	mxe5		What would be the best app to use to clone my hard drive to make a backup to another hard drive - running gnome 10.4 ? ?
2010-10-03T14:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mxe5	 You want an Image file as a 'backup' or are you cloning install #1 to work on pc #2?
2010-10-03T14:58:00.000Z	mxe5	Dr_Willis	Used to using Acronis for windows - would like to make a mirrored cloned image to another sata hard drive that's a little bigger - both western digital.
2010-10-03T14:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mxe5	 you can make a 'image' file via dd or other ways..  fsarchiver can 'clone' a hard drive to a 2nd drive
2010-10-03T15:01:00.000Z	mxe5	Dr_Willis	What did you mean by " you can make a 'image' file via dd " ?
2010-10-03T15:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mxe5	  dd if=/dev/sda of=sdaimagefile
2010-10-03T15:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mxe5	 thats an exact 'image' of the hard drive.
2010-10-03T15:01:00.000Z	mxe5	Dr_Willis	Ah ok got it.
2010-10-03T15:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mxe5	  you could also use 'fsarchiver' to clone the hd1 to hd2.. and still access hd2 normally. because it is a hard drive. not a 'image' file.
2010-10-03T15:04:00.000Z	mxe5	Dr_Willis	Second option sounds the easiest to me - but in the future would like to bone up on the shell way of doing it as well for the learning experience.
2010-10-03T15:05:00.000Z	mxe5	Dr_Willis	So the "clonezilla" would not be the way to go ? Is the "fsarchiver" a GUI app?
2010-10-03T15:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mxe5	 its a cli tool last i checked.. its desiogned to copy the file system/structure from FS1 to FS2.. ive never used clonezilla
2010-10-03T15:09:00.000Z	mxe5	Dr_Willis	Just installed but under "more info" it talks about the destination files being compressed - so would not be able to access sounds like - Have you personally used this method for backup ? If so good results ?
2010-10-03T15:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mxe5	 installed what?
2010-10-03T15:10:00.000Z	mxe5	Dr_Willis	The fsarchiver app
2010-10-03T15:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mxe5	 it has dozens of options last i tried it.. check its homepage/faq/docs.
2010-10-03T15:11:00.000Z	mxe5	Dr_Willis	Sorry tired and a little muddled right now.
2010-10-03T15:11:00.000Z	mxe5	Dr_Willis	Will give it a try - Thanks for input - appreciate it!
2010-10-03T15:24:00.000Z	mxe5	Dr_Willis	When you have time - Found this nice tutorial on youtube of cloning HD using Gparted to format new HD then using the shell commands - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq7u50eUoIU
2010-10-03T15:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mxe5	 ive done it with dd and followed by gparted befor. :)  its all about what you want for an end result.
2010-10-03T15:28:00.000Z	mxe5	Dr_Willis	I will you the the shell method, looks like the best way for me as of now.
2010-10-03T15:28:00.000Z	mxe5	Dr_Willis	Thanks
