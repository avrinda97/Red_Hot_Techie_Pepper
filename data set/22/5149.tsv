2007-07-09T07:05:00.000Z	zhm		can i msg you pelo?
2007-07-09T07:05:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 no state your issue here
2007-07-09T07:06:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 try to state your whole problem in one line
2007-07-09T07:08:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 I'm not familiar with the alternate cd, but i guess you will be using parted to to clear the second partition and then just let  the installer install on the largest unallocated space
2007-07-09T07:10:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 I thought you wanted to use all of d ? is there data on it ?
2007-07-09T07:10:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 then yes,  rezise to the minimum you need on d
2007-07-09T07:11:00.000Z	zhm	Pelo	you suggest creating 3 partitions here? root, home, swap
2007-07-09T07:11:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 that is generaly what I recommend yes
2007-07-09T07:13:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 what ?   how big is your d; partition ? when you look at it from windows ?
2007-07-09T07:13:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 how much data doyou hve on it ?
2007-07-09T07:16:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 you'll need about 5-10 gig for /  and 2xRAM for your swap,   the rest for /home,  you'll need ot figure out how much you want ,   that 30.3gb to 69.5gb is the new size of your d; partition, not the new partition space you will get for ubuntu,   so I guess give it 35 gig for d; and use the rest for ubuntu
2007-07-09T07:19:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 we try but sometimes we need to figure out what your actual problem is before we can give you a proper reply
2007-07-09T07:55:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 one line for the whole thing please it makes it easier to follow
2007-07-09T07:55:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 more or less,   go back in the same partitionning app,  and create new
2007-07-09T07:57:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 you can ,  but I think you can make at least one that is primary  if you do  do it for /
2007-07-09T07:58:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 and I said  CAN , not HAVE to
2007-07-09T08:02:00.000Z	zhm	Pelo	after i create a / and /home partition there's around 17gb free, but it says its unusable
2007-07-09T08:03:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 unusable or unallocated ?
2007-07-09T08:03:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 did you make both  / and /home primary ?
2007-07-09T08:04:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 try making them all  logical
2007-07-09T08:05:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 the intallation will reformat  / and make it bootable anyway, you donT' have to worry about that,   the one you are making now is basicaly just a placeholder
2007-07-09T08:07:00.000Z	Pelo	zhm	 I suggest you make  /home bigger
