2009-08-06T08:11:00.000Z	kad_		hey i install new kernel but when i do apt-get update! still receive update from old kernel? what's wrong ? how i can make it check update of my current kernel ?
2009-08-06T08:12:00.000Z	oldude67	kad_	did you do update-grub ?
2009-08-06T08:12:00.000Z	kad_	oldude67	what do u mean? i change the menu.lst only to new kernel
2009-08-06T08:13:00.000Z	oldude67	kad_	so you have to do a sudo update-grub
2009-08-06T08:13:00.000Z	oldude67		!ask | lexxy
2009-08-06T08:14:00.000Z	kad_	oldude67	 the new kernel i didn't name it  like vmlinuz-2.6.28-11-generic i name it kad-2.6.30 ! does this make effect since when i do update-grub give me old one !
2009-08-06T08:15:00.000Z	oldude67	kad_	it dont matter what you name the kernel you still have to update grub.
2009-08-06T08:15:00.000Z	kad_	oldude67	 i did update-grub ! give me the old kernel not the new one ? why ?
2009-08-06T08:15:00.000Z	oldude67	kad_	it has to point to that kernel image
2009-08-06T08:16:00.000Z	kad_	oldude67	i add this to menu.lst the new kernel and when i do uname -r give me new kernel! but on update-grub don't? how i can fix it ?
2009-08-06T08:17:00.000Z	oldude67	kad_	is that the name of the original kernel you downloaded, and if not does that name point to it in some way..if not you have to name it the same as what you downloaded.
2009-08-06T08:18:00.000Z	kad_	oldude67	download it as : linux-2.6.30
2009-08-06T08:18:00.000Z	oldude67	kad_	yes if thats the name of what it was when you downloaded it thats probably the name you will have to put in your grub menu.lst.
2009-08-06T08:19:00.000Z	kad_	oldude67	okie i'll change to the original name
2009-08-06T08:19:00.000Z	oldude67	kad_	then do update-grub again.
2009-08-06T08:20:00.000Z	kad_	oldude67	still the same :(
2009-08-06T08:21:00.000Z	oldude67	kad_	then something dont seem right can you paste the outcome of update-grub ?
2009-08-06T08:22:00.000Z	kad_	oldude67	 i pastebin update-grub and menu.lst http://pastebin.com/m1531aa3
2009-08-06T08:27:00.000Z	kad_	oldude67	 any issue ?
2009-08-06T08:28:00.000Z	oldude67	kad_	im not real sure, not to use to grub yet, more of a lilo man myself...maybe someone in here can look at it an see.
