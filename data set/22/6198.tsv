2006-12-03T11:28:00.000Z	sain	ompaul	we want to get rid of his proxy setting
2006-12-03T11:29:00.000Z	ompaul	sain	from? web browser or apt?
2006-12-03T11:29:00.000Z	sain	ompaul	apt ... it was using the proxy
2006-12-03T11:30:00.000Z	ompaul	sain	very easy in synaptic
2006-12-03T11:30:00.000Z	sain	ompaul	than talk him through it ... i don't run ubuntu :)
2006-12-03T11:30:00.000Z	ompaul	sain	seems he is getting enough help
2006-12-03T11:30:00.000Z	sain	ompaul	only noticed his problem was that he was connecting to a proxy running on his local machine
2006-12-03T11:41:00.000Z	sain	ompaul	he says he was using JAP proxy, and uninstalled it. For some reason it is still trying to use the proxy ...
2006-12-03T11:41:00.000Z	ompaul	sain	well he should not be pointing at it now :)
2006-12-03T11:42:00.000Z	sain	ompaul	yes, 'shouldn't be', but is ... maybe not purged
2006-12-03T11:43:00.000Z	ompaul	sain	well his software should not be using it now if he has done what I said
2006-12-03T11:44:00.000Z	ompaul	sain	that was the gui thing I just did :)
2006-12-03T11:44:00.000Z	sain	ompaul	ah ok, i'll leave it in your capable hands
2006-12-03T11:45:00.000Z	sain	ompaul	just his $http_proxy keeps getting set back to localhost ....
2006-12-03T11:45:00.000Z	ompaul	sain	I think what happened is that sudo apt-get remove --purge packagename was not doen
2006-12-03T11:47:00.000Z	sain	ompaul	yeah ... not being on ubuntu, how does he know make sure all the anon-proxy files are purged?
2006-12-03T11:56:00.000Z	ompaul	sain	there is the most obvious one :-)
2006-12-03T11:57:00.000Z	ompaul	sain	get progam "bum" installed and use it to turn off that proxy item simple gui for daemon management
2006-12-03T11:57:00.000Z	ompaul	sain	I must depart
