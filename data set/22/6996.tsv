2011-11-13T23:13:00.000Z	ulrik		I just upgraded to 11.10, and when I try to install Wine, "apt-get install wine" gives me the error message "The following packages have unmet dependencies: wine : Depends: wine1.3 but it is not going to be installed. Depends: ia32-libs (>= 1.6) but it is not going to be installed. E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages." Trying to install ia32-libs only complains that ia32-libs-multiarch isn't installed, etc.
2011-11-13T23:14:00.000Z	jrib	ulrik	you have no idea why?
2011-11-13T23:16:00.000Z	ulrik	jrib	I might have aborted some package updates because the computer froze
2011-11-13T23:16:00.000Z	jrib	ulrik	run « sudo dpkg --configure -a »
2011-11-13T23:17:00.000Z	ulrik	jrib	And then what? Nothing happens.
2011-11-13T23:17:00.000Z	jrib	ulrik	« sudo apt-get install -f »
2011-11-13T23:19:00.000Z	ulrik	jrib	that doesn't help, either
2011-11-13T23:19:00.000Z	jrib	ulrik	pastebin full output
2011-11-13T23:20:00.000Z	ulrik	jrib	http://pastebin.com/EJuKXNz1
2011-11-13T23:22:00.000Z	jrib	ulrik	run « sudo apt-get update » and try again.  If output is the same, pastebin the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list* and the output of the command « apt-cache policy wine wine1.3 ia32-libs »
2011-11-13T23:25:00.000Z	ulrik	jrib	sources.list here http://pastebin.com/m70XxPLZ and apt-cache here http://pastebin.com/N4eSW22v
2011-11-13T23:26:00.000Z	jrib	ulrik	why do you have precise repositories?
2011-11-13T23:26:00.000Z	ulrik	jrib	eh... I don't know.
2011-11-13T23:27:00.000Z	ulrik	jrib	How/where do I change them?
2011-11-13T23:27:00.000Z	jrib	ulrik	have you installed anything from precise?
2011-11-13T23:28:00.000Z	ulrik	jrib	not on purpose, no
2011-11-13T23:28:00.000Z	jrib	ulrik	doesn't matter if it was on purpose
2011-11-13T23:29:00.000Z	jrib	ulrik	if a significant portion of your system is on precise and you'd prefer to stay on natty, then you should just reinstall.  If you just added these repositories but never installed anything from them, then just remove them from your sources.list and run an « apt-get update »
2011-11-13T23:29:00.000Z	ulrik	jrib	I understand. To my knowledge I haven't, no
2011-11-13T23:30:00.000Z	ulrik	jrib	I see. Is there some easy way of seeing if it is? If a large portion is on precise, I mean
2011-11-13T23:31:00.000Z	jrib	ulrik	you could construct an aptitude search to do so, but I'd have to read the documentation to be more exact.  You can check individual packages just using apt-cache policy
2011-11-13T23:32:00.000Z	ulrik	jrib	okay, I will do that. Thanks for your help.
