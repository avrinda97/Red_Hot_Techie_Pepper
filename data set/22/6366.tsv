2007-07-14T07:24:00.000Z	Brent_		I believe, from researching my drives, that Grub is pointing to the right disks, but I'm not sure still
2007-07-14T07:25:00.000Z	Brent_		I would love to hear it, even if it's not right. I'm willing to try anything
2007-07-14T07:25:00.000Z	Brent_		I'm running Ubuntu from an external drive
2007-07-14T07:25:00.000Z	Brent_		When my external drive is connected, Grub runs, but doesn't actually WORK
2007-07-14T07:25:00.000Z	Brent_		When my external drive is not connected, Grub doesn't run, and Windows boots as normal
2007-07-14T07:26:00.000Z	Brent_		Yes, in my bios, it's bootable before the regular drive, but apart from that, I'm not sure
2007-07-14T07:27:00.000Z	Brent_		I don't remember seeing the option. Maybe I missed it?
2007-07-14T07:28:00.000Z	Brent_		I BELIEVE that it's labeled as bootable
2007-07-14T07:28:00.000Z	Brent_		I'm using XP on my main laptop drive, and Ubuntu on my external
2007-07-14T07:28:00.000Z	Brent_		I don't know 100% if it's bootable, just going by a very vague memory
2007-07-14T07:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Brent_	Well GRUB needs an ext3 partition with a menu.list to function, which is why it doesn't work with the drive not plugged in
2007-07-14T07:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Brent_	What you probably want to do is write grub to the external drive instead of the laptops MBR
2007-07-14T07:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Brent_	Sorry I misread your earlier post, I thought you said without the drive grub loads but doesn't work, not with it
2007-07-14T07:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Brent_	What error do you get from GRUB, do you see the GRUB menu at all?
2007-07-14T07:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Brent_	What are you trying to run?
2007-07-14T07:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Brent_	You shouldn't have a /boot ( well you can but you don't need one and it sounds like you wouldn't know how to set it up )
2007-07-14T07:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Brent_	Rather, you shouldn't have a seperate /boot partition
2007-07-14T07:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Brent_	Yes
2007-07-14T07:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Brent_	You shouldn't have, most people don't have one
2007-07-14T07:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Brent_	Are you booted into a LiveCD right now?
2007-07-14T07:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Brent_	Yes, there is gaim, you can also install xchat ( even while using the LiveCD )
2007-07-14T07:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Brent_	Yes, boot the LiveCD on the laptop
