2007-04-19T08:05:00.000Z	larryone		my X session keeps hanging and I am having serious trouble debugging it. Am I likely to have more success with the prop drivers for my ATI card??
2007-04-19T08:06:00.000Z	delire	larryone	yes probably. did you look in ~/.xsession-errors?
2007-04-19T08:06:00.000Z	delire	larryone	ahah.. interesting.
2007-04-19T08:07:00.000Z	delire	larryone	try creating a new user and see if it happens when logged in as that user..
2007-04-19T08:07:00.000Z	larryone	delire	I'll give it a go
2007-04-19T08:07:00.000Z	delire	larryone	maybe some panel preference you set has gone awry somehow. does sound very unusual though.
2007-04-19T08:08:00.000Z	larryone	delire	this is a fresh install...
2007-04-19T08:08:00.000Z	delire	larryone	oh.. odd.
2007-04-19T08:08:00.000Z	larryone	delire	I have been trying to get ubuntu running on this machine for weeks now
2007-04-19T08:08:00.000Z	delire	larryone	odd. what's the machine?
2007-04-19T08:09:00.000Z	larryone	delire	AMD Athlon
2007-04-19T08:10:00.000Z	larryone	delire	dapper wouldnt install from cd for me - now would Edgy. tried all 64 and 32 bit versions only thing that would install was breezy 64bit
2007-04-19T08:10:00.000Z	delire	larryone	oh.. well i haven't had problems on this arch. perhaps you might want to install the proprietary graphics drivers. before you do though, install openssh-server and i can walk you through connecting to it from another machine.
2007-04-19T08:10:00.000Z	delire	larryone	do you have another UNIX machine around?
2007-04-19T08:11:00.000Z	larryone	delire	I have a dapper machine that never gave me problems  but it's a bit slow
2007-04-19T08:11:00.000Z	larryone	delire	but I only have one network uplink
2007-04-19T08:11:00.000Z	delire	larryone	probably hard disk speed related. install openssh-server on the offending machine, note the IP and ssh into it when it hangs. we can find out what's wrong.
2007-04-19T08:12:00.000Z	delire	larryone	ok.. can you get into a console though? eg with CTRL-ALT-F2
2007-04-19T08:13:00.000Z	larryone	delire	I tried the consoles - but when the X hangs so does the whole system
2007-04-19T08:13:00.000Z	larryone	delire	I know its a graphical problem because the machine doesnt hang if I leave the X alone and just go console based
2007-04-19T10:18:00.000Z	larryone	delire	was it you I was talking to about my broken X server???
2007-04-19T10:27:00.000Z	delire	larryone	yes you were talking to me about it
