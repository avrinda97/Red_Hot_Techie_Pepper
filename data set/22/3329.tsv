2008-10-08T12:27:00.000Z	dtech		is this the best channel for install questions/issues?
2008-10-08T12:28:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	Try asking and find out.
2008-10-08T12:28:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	(ie. don't ask to ask, just ask. If you don't get a satisfactory reply, look elsewhere)
2008-10-08T12:30:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	No, ask the real question that you want to ask.
2008-10-08T12:30:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	So you're just conducting a survey to find out where you can ask about stuff?
2008-10-08T12:31:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	(ie. you're not having trouble installing ubuntu, you just want to know in case you meet someone that does or run into trouble later?)
2008-10-08T12:31:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	That might be the screen saver.
2008-10-08T12:31:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	Try pressing [Shift] to wake your screen back up.
2008-10-08T12:35:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	How much RAM does this computer have?
2008-10-08T12:35:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	It might be that you're running out. If that is the case you might need the alternate install cd.
2008-10-08T12:36:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	If you run out it does. Ie. 256 mb is not enough to run the graphical installer.
2008-10-08T12:36:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	512 should be enough for xubuntu and ubuntu but iirc not kubuntu.
2008-10-08T12:37:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	Also the installer, for some reason, does not check if there's enough ram.
2008-10-08T12:37:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	It is. But even linux can run out of memory if you use too much of it.
2008-10-08T12:38:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	ie, the finished installation will run *buntu with 256 mb of ram, but the installation application requires alot.
2008-10-08T12:38:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	One of the reasons this happens is because when installing you haven't got access to a swap partition so everything needs to fit in memory. That makes 256 mb too little.
2008-10-08T12:39:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	I am not telling you that linux needs it. If you use the alternate install cd you'll be ok.
2008-10-08T12:40:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	You can.
2008-10-08T12:44:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	Please remember that the graphical login is a full implementation of *buntu but without the ability to write to swap. Even windows xp's installation procedure defaults to something like the alternate install of *buntu. Also I believe that 512 wouldn't be enough to run a full XP w/o swap and a big installer program.
2008-10-08T12:45:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	If you define a swap partition and enable it before starting the graphical installer you should be ok.
2008-10-08T12:48:00.000Z	dtech	blueeagle	swap file in linux .... hahaha ... I just learn linux doesn't have a 'c' in it! ... there's no way I'm gonna figure out how to create a post-install swap-file in it! *grin*
2008-10-08T12:48:00.000Z	blueeagle	dtech	Actually it's a swap partition.
