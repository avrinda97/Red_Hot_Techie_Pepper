2008-04-08T01:23:00.000Z	Jowi	Rayyan	you said you haven't used ubuntu in a while. which version are you using? ina terminal type: lsb_release -a
2008-04-08T01:26:00.000Z	Jowi	Rayyan	which version are you using? Hoary and Breezy are not supported anymore. please see if you have one of those versions.
2008-04-08T01:29:00.000Z	Jowi	Rayyan	when you run "sudo apt-get update" what errors do you get?
2008-04-08T01:30:00.000Z	Jowi	Rayyan	sounds plausible. set network interface to listen to DHCP
2008-04-08T01:33:00.000Z	Jowi	Rayyan	is eth0 in /etc/network/interfaces set to dhcp or static?
2008-04-08T01:33:00.000Z	Jowi	Rayyan	cat /etc/network/interfaces
2008-04-08T01:35:00.000Z	Rayyan	Jowi	i still dnt know how to check it
2008-04-08T01:35:00.000Z	Jowi	Rayyan	I just told you. scroll up.
2008-04-08T01:36:00.000Z	Jowi	Rayyan	"cat" is equal to "type" in Windows
2008-04-08T01:36:00.000Z	Jowi	Rayyan	"cat /etc/network/interfaces" in a terminal will print that file on the screen for you
2008-04-08T01:38:00.000Z	Jowi	Rayyan	do you have more than one network card listed there?
2008-04-08T01:38:00.000Z	Jowi	Rayyan	what is USB0? wifi?
