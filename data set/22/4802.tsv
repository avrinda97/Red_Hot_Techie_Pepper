2008-02-24T06:26:00.000Z	andrej		where can I find documentation on how to "backport" postgresql 8.3 to edgy?
2008-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	andrej		How safe is it to update edgy to gutsy?
2008-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	speart	andrej	dependes on your configuration
2008-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	andrej	speart	: more specifically?
2008-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	speart	andrej	it'll work but you'll need to install 3rd party things
2008-02-24T06:30:00.000Z	speart	andrej	use apt-get only
2008-02-24T06:30:00.000Z	andrej	speart	so if I just put gutsy into my sources.list you reckon it will work with an update & dist-upgrade?
2008-02-24T06:31:00.000Z	speart	andrej	if you think that you'll save time than you should try
2008-02-24T06:31:00.000Z	speart	andrej	worked for me before
2008-02-24T06:33:00.000Z	speart	andrej	apart from openoffice I don't think it worth the upgrade
2008-02-24T06:33:00.000Z	andrej	speart	I want a newer version of postgres ...
2008-02-24T06:35:00.000Z	speart	andrej	fixes of what
2008-02-24T06:35:00.000Z	andrej	speart	: postgreSQL
2008-02-24T06:36:00.000Z	speart	andrej	install from source then
2008-02-24T06:36:00.000Z	andrej	speart	how do I tie a newer version of PG into the debian/ubuntu way of building things?
2008-02-24T06:37:00.000Z	speart	andrej	1 second
2008-02-24T06:39:00.000Z	speart	andrej	you can try to install the latests .deb
2008-02-24T06:39:00.000Z	andrej	speart	you mean d/l the 8.3 deb for gtsy and throw that at edgy?
2008-02-24T06:40:00.000Z	speart	andrej	shorter than upgrade
2008-02-24T06:40:00.000Z	speart	andrej	more stable process too, if you think server-wise
2008-02-24T06:40:00.000Z	speart	andrej	got gnome on that machine?
2008-02-24T06:42:00.000Z	speart	andrej	dpkg should work
