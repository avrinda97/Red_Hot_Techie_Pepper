2007-04-22T14:00:00.000Z	mstevens		anyone help with NetworkManager? It's refusing to talk to my access point. Worked in edgy pre-nm.
2007-04-22T14:00:00.000Z	antidrugue	mstevens	so this is a system you upgraded, or a clean installation?
2007-04-22T14:01:00.000Z	antidrugue	mstevens	does it just not connect, does it give you any error?
2007-04-22T14:02:00.000Z	antidrugue	mstevens	: that's good, did you happen to read my tutorial (http://technowizah.com/2007/02/debian-how-to-managing-networks-with.html) ?
2007-04-22T14:02:00.000Z	mstevens	antidrugue	nah, a similar article elsewhere
2007-04-22T14:03:00.000Z	antidrugue	mstevens	hum... what is the output of "groups" ?

2007-04-22T14:04:00.000Z	antidrugue	mstevens	that's your problem right there: you are not part of the "netdev" group
