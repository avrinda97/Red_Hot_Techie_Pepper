2009-11-08T04:58:00.000Z	WACOMalt	soreau	alsamixer shows me a vga-ish sound graph
2009-11-08T10:42:00.000Z	soreau	WACOMalt	Hack: Try chmod -x /etc/init.d/pulseaudio and reboot
2009-11-08T10:42:00.000Z	WACOMalt	soreau	what does that do first?
2009-11-08T10:43:00.000Z	WACOMalt	soreau	oh... well technically it is running right now
2009-11-08T10:43:00.000Z	WACOMalt	soreau	it just doesnt see my card... at all
2009-11-08T10:43:00.000Z	soreau	WACOMalt	It makes that file no longer executable which means pulseaudio wont start at all when you boot. You can reverse it by running the same command with +x
2009-11-08T10:44:00.000Z	WACOMalt	soreau	oh well when I screwed up pulse before to where it wouldn't start, I had sound perfectly, but still no volume controller in the notification area (and no keyboard volume button support)
2009-11-08T10:45:00.000Z	soreau	WACOMalt	Is that where you are currently?
2009-11-08T10:45:00.000Z	WACOMalt	soreau	no, I fixed the config file, so not pulse is running, I have the controls, but they arent linked to my sound. I set the actual sound to ALSA though gstreamer-properties. So I have sound and a controller, but the controler is not linked, and is controlling dummy audio
2009-11-08T10:46:00.000Z	soreau	WACOMalt	Well I don't understand what is going on then. Sounds like you've already taken the situation into your own hands
2009-11-08T10:47:00.000Z	WACOMalt	soreau	well I have, but stil I am stuck. I have sound yes. and a controller yes... but the controller doesn't support ALSA outputs.. this no sound control from it.  I can run gnome-alsamixer manually and get an alsa mixer, but that is stupid... I shouldnt have to.
2009-11-08T10:48:00.000Z	WACOMalt	soreau	if I could just get pulse working, or get the current notification area volume controller to support ALSA, then I'd be set
2009-11-08T10:48:00.000Z	soreau	WACOMalt	Like I said, I don't understand what is going on there
2009-11-08T10:49:00.000Z	WACOMalt	soreau	 marioatlp told me to comment out the udev module loading int he pulse files
2009-11-08T10:58:00.000Z	soreau	WACOMalt	I suspect the chmod command I gave would have done something very similar
2009-11-08T10:58:00.000Z	WACOMalt	soreau	I tried it actually
2009-11-08T10:58:00.000Z	WACOMalt	soreau	his command basically disabled udev and made it use regular hardware detection. Pulseaudio IS working and seeing myc ard and controllable
2009-11-08T10:59:00.000Z	soreau	WACOMalt	oh cool
2009-11-08T10:59:00.000Z	WACOMalt	soreau	so it bypassed a bug in udev.  Where can I report bugs in udev?
2009-11-08T10:59:00.000Z	soreau	WACOMalt	nfc
2009-11-08T11:00:00.000Z	WACOMalt	soreau	?
2009-11-08T11:00:00.000Z	soreau	WACOMalt	It's an acronym. Figure it out ;)
