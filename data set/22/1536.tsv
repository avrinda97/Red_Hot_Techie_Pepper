2011-02-11T00:22:00.000Z	kallisti5		anyone seen a strange issue where on a new 10.10 install..  no network interfaces show up in the network manager? (even though i have eth0 and wlan0 in ifconfig)   i was able to dhclient eth0 without any problems.
2011-02-11T00:23:00.000Z	BluesKaj	kallisti5	dump  network manager and do this : http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/setting-up-an-network-interfaces-file/
2011-02-11T00:24:00.000Z	kallisti5	BluesKaj	i had to dump the gui and do a manual setup though on a desktop.

2011-02-11T00:25:00.000Z	BluesKaj	kallisti5	that tutorial is very thorough and it has some good suggestions for tweaking the nic as well
2011-02-11T00:31:00.000Z	kallisti5	BluesKaj	wierd!  service network-manager stop ; service network-manager start and things started working
2011-02-11T00:31:00.000Z	kallisti5	BluesKaj	maybe make network-manager start later in boot?
2011-02-11T00:31:00.000Z	BluesKaj	kallisti5	yes , when you removed nm , the restart is usually required
2011-02-11T00:32:00.000Z	BluesKaj	kallisti5	make sure your router IP is listed in the /etc/network/interface to set the connection at boot
2011-02-11T00:37:00.000Z	BluesKaj	kallisti5	the router IP is not the gatewayIP, it's the nameserver IP listed on /etc/resolv.conf
2011-02-11T00:37:00.000Z	kallisti5	BluesKaj	do what now?
2011-02-11T00:39:00.000Z	BluesKaj	kallisti5	copy the nameserver IP listed on /etc/resolv.conf to /etc/network/interfaces and list it as: gateway 192.168.x.x
2011-02-11T00:40:00.000Z	kallisti5	BluesKaj	wrong nic?
2011-02-11T00:40:00.000Z	BluesKaj	kallisti5	or whatever the nameserver IP is
2011-02-11T00:40:00.000Z	kallisti5	BluesKaj	*wrong nickname*  eg.. i think you have the wrong person
2011-02-11T00:41:00.000Z	BluesKaj	kallisti5	nic=network interface connection
2011-02-11T00:43:00.000Z	kallisti5	BluesKaj	umm...  yeah. just missed the k. anyway.. i think you are looking at another conversation.  i can configure a network card manually... it's just that ubuntu's network manager service seems broken on boot and i have to do a stop and a start to get thins working.
2011-02-11T00:48:00.000Z	BluesKaj	kallisti5	 "<kallisti5> BluesKaj: maybe make network-manager start later in boot?" I was talking about a method to set the router IP connection permanently
2011-02-11T00:49:00.000Z	BluesKaj	kallisti5	sorr to have misunderstood your question , if that's what you mean.
2011-02-11T00:52:00.000Z	kallisti5	BluesKaj	what i ment was move the /etc/rcx.d/S20network-interface to /etc/rcx.d/S60network-interface
2011-02-11T00:52:00.000Z	kallisti5	BluesKaj	thanks for the help though
2011-02-11T00:53:00.000Z	BluesKaj	kallisti5	well you're welcome , if it helped :)
