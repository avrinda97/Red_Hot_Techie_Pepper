2006-11-08T15:03:00.000Z	verboxx		hi! this may be a noob question, but can I login as root to a Gnome Session?
2006-11-08T15:04:00.000Z	verboxx		and can I create a user with all the root privileges??
2006-11-08T15:04:00.000Z	shwag	verboxx	just edit them into all the needed groups in /etc/groups
2006-11-08T15:04:00.000Z	shwag	verboxx	do you know how to get a users home directory created ?
2006-11-08T15:06:00.000Z	shwag	verboxx	if you hate terminal then get off of linux.
2006-11-08T15:07:00.000Z	shwag	verboxx	there is ways to do it in the GUI too, but it is going to be a long hard road if you avoid the terminal. terminal is fun. repeat after me, terminal is fun.
2006-11-08T15:07:00.000Z	shwag	verboxx	besides...how are you ever going to admin a remote server without knowing how to use a terminal.
2006-11-08T15:08:00.000Z	verboxx	shwag	It's my work. and its really not for me, but for a co-worker
2006-11-08T15:08:00.000Z	shwag	verboxx	so you are just helping a friend with ubuntu ?
2006-11-08T15:09:00.000Z	verboxx	shwag	yep, and he doesnt speak english
2006-11-08T15:10:00.000Z	verboxx	shwag	I already added a user to all the root groups: disk, adm, etc, but not working
2006-11-08T15:11:00.000Z	shwag	verboxx	what exactly are you trying to acheive ?
2006-11-08T15:11:00.000Z	verboxx	shwag	that a machine login automatically like root. or login like a root-alias
2006-11-08T15:12:00.000Z	shwag	verboxx	so you are trying to get your GUI to load as root ?
2006-11-08T15:12:00.000Z	verboxx	shwag	automatically, when I boot up the machine
2006-11-08T15:12:00.000Z	shwag	verboxx	so you want your machine to startup with NO security ?
2006-11-08T15:12:00.000Z	verboxx	shwag	yep. NOOOOO security, like wintendo
2006-11-08T15:13:00.000Z	shwag	verboxx	windows users dont realize that this does not make linux easier. It actually makes linux CRASH MORE. Stop now.
2006-11-08T15:13:00.000Z	shwag	verboxx	a horrible horrible idea. please just stop. You have no point.
2006-11-08T15:14:00.000Z	verboxx	shwag	I understand the problem but my friend here doesn't understand the problem
2006-11-08T15:17:00.000Z	shwag	verboxx	well thats what friends are for
2006-11-08T15:17:00.000Z	shwag	verboxx	just because your friend is ... , doesn't mean you have to waste our time.
