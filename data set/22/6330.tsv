2007-03-13T05:50:00.000Z	gordonjcp		;-)
2007-03-13T05:51:00.000Z	h1st0	gordonjcp	unless you have like 1 gig of memory.
2007-03-13T05:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	h1st0	one of my computers has 10M of swap, and 1M of RAM... ;-)
2007-03-13T05:53:00.000Z	h1st0	gordonjcp	I was just saying with 1gig of ram a 2gig swap is kind of rediculous.  It should be more like 512mb of swap witht 1g ram
2007-03-13T05:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	h1st0	... unless you want suspend ;-)
2007-03-13T05:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	h1st0	and anyway, disk is cheap now
2007-03-13T05:54:00.000Z	h1st0	gordonjcp	You should still be able to suspend as long as you arent' using 1gig of physical ram at the time.
2007-03-13T05:54:00.000Z	h1st0	gordonjcp	let me try hold up
2007-03-13T05:54:00.000Z	gordonjcp	h1st0	well, you need as much swap as memory in use ;-)
2007-03-13T05:55:00.000Z	h1st0	gordonjcp	by suspend you mean hibernate?
2007-03-13T05:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	h1st0	I think it's safe enough to say that these days, you can throw enough RAM in that you don't need swap
2007-03-13T05:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	h1st0	hibernate or suspend to disk
2007-03-13T05:55:00.000Z	h1st0	gordonjcp	don't have a suspend option in shutdown let me see if hibernate works brb.
2007-03-13T05:59:00.000Z	h1st0	gordonjcp	wow my system did not like hibernate one bit.  Never actually shut off.
2007-03-13T06:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	h1st0	'cos there's not enough disk space to suspend to...
2007-03-13T06:00:00.000Z	h1st0	gordonjcp	only using 137mb of ram atm
2007-03-13T06:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	h1st0	I haven't played with it yet
2007-03-13T06:00:00.000Z	h1st0	gordonjcp	and 0mb of swap
2007-03-13T06:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	h1st0	no swap at all?
2007-03-13T06:01:00.000Z	h1st0	gordonjcp	nope.
2007-03-13T06:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	h1st0	hm, think it needs a swap device to hibernate
2007-03-13T06:02:00.000Z	h1st0	gordonjcp	I have swap
