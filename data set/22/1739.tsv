2010-02-15T10:21:00.000Z	magn3ts		How do I install cursors?
2010-02-15T10:23:00.000Z	magn3ts		but it offered to apply it for me
2010-02-15T10:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	magn3ts	you can install gcursor which is a GUI frontend to install / manage pointers (poorly named app really)
2010-02-15T10:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	magn3ts	and scratch my idea - tried gcursor and can't actually get it to apply pointer changes for whatever reason
2010-03-31T00:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	magn3ts	i'm not sure you can anymore "gdmflexiserver --help" shows "-n, --xnest Ignored - retained for compatibility" (but check in Karmic)
2010-03-31T00:58:00.000Z	magn3ts	ZykoticK9	fantastic, that *is* it, I remember now. thanks a ton
2011-01-07T11:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	magn3ts	whey something is run with "sudo" it means it's being run with the root account
2011-01-07T11:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	magn3ts	correct
2011-05-31T07:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	magn3ts	now that advice is verging on !wares
2011-05-31T07:29:00.000Z	magn3ts	ZykoticK9	sorry.
2011-06-26T10:53:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	magn3ts	do you happen to be talking about IRC passwords?
2011-06-26T10:53:00.000Z	magn3ts	ZykoticK9	any passwords in Empathy, if you change them... the changed pw fails to persist in empathy
2011-07-03T09:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	magn3ts	search for indicator-messanger or something similar
2011-07-03T09:24:00.000Z	magn3ts	ZykoticK9	thank you, I assumed it was part of the complete indicators package but that's not the case.
2011-07-03T09:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	magn3ts	glad to help.  when i used empathy/gwibber i found that that indicator kinda handy - personally
2011-07-03T09:25:00.000Z	magn3ts	ZykoticK9	I tried for nearly two full months to use Unity, Empathy and Gwibber.
2011-07-03T09:35:00.000Z	magn3ts	ZykoticK9	do you know why truepurple is calling it "a corrupt installation" ?
2011-07-03T09:35:00.000Z	magn3ts	ZykoticK9	if dpkg installed it and apt-get isn't errored out, idk what the problem is.
2011-07-03T09:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	magn3ts	not really
2011-07-03T09:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	magn3ts	mystery here too
2011-07-03T10:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	magn3ts	Network Address Translation
2011-07-03T10:29:00.000Z	magn3ts	ZykoticK9	makes sense, thanks.
