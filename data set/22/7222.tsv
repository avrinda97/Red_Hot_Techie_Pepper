2006-05-17T12:38:00.000Z	jksd		is it OK to ask a general UNIX question in here?
2006-05-17T12:38:00.000Z	paradizelost	jksd	just ask
2006-05-17T12:40:00.000Z	jksd	paradizelost	should I stick with red hat then?
2006-05-17T12:40:00.000Z	paradizelost	jksd	i'd go ubuntu over rhat
2006-05-17T12:41:00.000Z	jksd	paradizelost	the reason why I'd prefer Red Hat is because it has a full training course
2006-05-17T12:41:00.000Z	jksd	paradizelost	yea, I'm talking about enterprize server
2006-05-17T12:41:00.000Z	paradizelost	jksd	you do realize your in the #ubuntu room right?  it'd be like asking in #microsoft if windows or linux was better...
2006-05-17T12:42:00.000Z	jksd	paradizelost	there's no officia training for ubuntu
2006-05-17T12:43:00.000Z	paradizelost	jksd	but the issues they'll train you on aren't the ones your going to run into real-world.
2006-05-17T12:44:00.000Z	jksd	paradizelost	howcomes?
2006-05-17T12:45:00.000Z	paradizelost	jksd	actually, for beginners, i'd go a mac server....:D
2006-05-17T12:46:00.000Z	jksd	paradizelost	for real though, which should I go for?
2006-05-17T12:47:00.000Z	paradizelost	jksd	if you need support and training, redhat..  but they'll cost mucho $$$$
2006-05-17T12:47:00.000Z	jksd	paradizelost	hosting
2006-05-17T12:47:00.000Z	paradizelost	jksd	what kind of hosting?
2006-05-17T12:48:00.000Z	jksd	paradizelost	haven't decided yet
2006-05-17T12:48:00.000Z	jksd	paradizelost	yeah
2006-05-17T12:48:00.000Z	jksd	paradizelost	why would you reccomend RH?
2006-05-17T12:48:00.000Z	jksd	paradizelost	ease of use?
2006-05-17T12:48:00.000Z	paradizelost	jksd	as i said, i HATE redhat
2006-05-17T12:49:00.000Z	jksd	paradizelost	I've been told that Red Hat is no easier than solaris, but that doesn't sound right to me
2006-05-17T12:51:00.000Z	paradizelost	jksd	as i said, redhat is the M$FT of linux.
