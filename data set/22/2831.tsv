2009-11-08T16:53:00.000Z	Drule		Hey guys. I'm switching from Ubuntu to Windows on my computer, but I have about 26gb of data that I need to transfer to my Windows Vista laptop before I can do so. Networking is broken on said Ubuntu computer, so how would I go about doing this?
2009-11-08T16:54:00.000Z	Drule		Wow Dravekx_
2009-11-08T16:54:00.000Z	Drule		you can't tell but I'm cracking up right now at that joke
2009-11-08T16:54:00.000Z	Drule		hold on
2009-11-08T16:54:00.000Z	Drule		I'm writing it down for later use
2009-11-08T16:54:00.000Z	Drule		I only have one partition.
2009-11-08T16:54:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Drule	what network card do you have?
2009-11-08T16:54:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Drule	are you transferring from PC -> PC ?
2009-11-08T16:55:00.000Z	Drule	ibuclaw	I have a LAN/WLAN one. Don't know the name.
2009-11-08T16:55:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Drule	if you can get ubuntu connected via cat5, you can use rsync
2009-11-08T16:55:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Drule	cat5 == ethernet
2009-11-08T16:56:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Drule	you tried connecting directly?
2009-11-08T16:57:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Drule	never tried it, but a guess is that you probably used the wrong type
2009-11-08T16:57:00.000Z	Drule	ibuclaw	Wrong type of cable?
2009-11-08T16:57:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Drule	there are two types of Ethernet
2009-11-08T16:59:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Drule	there are cat5 patch cables, used for connecting to a network device (ie: hubs/switches/routers)
2009-11-08T16:59:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Drule	then there are crossover cables, used to connect two machines together
2009-11-08T17:00:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Drule	the only difference between them is how the wires at each end are aligned as

2009-11-08T17:00:00.000Z	Drule	ibuclaw	Ahh, I see.
2009-11-08T17:02:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Drule	once you have connected them, check the IP address of the network card
2009-11-08T17:03:00.000Z	Drule	ibuclaw	The problem is that my Ubuntu computer has messed up network settings.
