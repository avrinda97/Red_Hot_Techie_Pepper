2007-11-20T01:12:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	you may find better help asking on the forum than posting every 30 seconds
2007-11-20T01:12:00.000Z	ader10	ikonia	You can help?
2007-11-20T01:12:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	no, or I would have done
2008-02-06T01:28:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	it's a busy channel, don't take anything personally
2010-07-20T19:19:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	what ip are you trying to use
2010-07-20T19:19:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	it's probably nothing to do with your ssh setting, more ilkey to do with networking
2010-07-20T19:19:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	is this a home broadband/cable connection
2010-07-20T19:19:00.000Z	ader10	ikonia	yes
2010-07-20T19:20:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	ok, the odds are you've not setup port forwarding properly
2010-07-20T19:20:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	you know ssh is working, so the issue must be between internal/external IP forwarding
2010-07-20T19:20:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	you're currently using vista ?
2010-07-20T19:21:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	your client responds as vista
2010-07-20T19:21:00.000Z	ader10	ikonia	I set it up to do that
2010-07-20T19:21:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	can you please show me the output of uname -a please
2010-07-20T19:23:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	can you paste the full line please
2010-07-20T19:24:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	either way, this isn't an ubuntu issue, as you know ssh is working on your lan
2010-07-20T19:24:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	so the problem is between your public ip/forward to your private lan
2010-07-20T19:25:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	I've just probed that ip and it's not listening on anything, meaning it's not forwarding to anthing most likley
2010-07-20T19:27:00.000Z	ikonia	ader10	it doesn't look like it's forwarding
