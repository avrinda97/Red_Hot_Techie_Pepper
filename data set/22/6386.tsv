2006-11-28T15:14:00.000Z	britt		does anybody know of a console word processor (not vi-like) that I can use to type RTF files or something
2006-11-28T15:14:00.000Z	reverseblade	britt	RTF is no no from console
2006-11-28T15:14:00.000Z	britt	reverseblade	or whatever I can do from console
2006-11-28T15:15:00.000Z	reverseblade	britt	there is nano
2006-11-28T15:15:00.000Z	reverseblade	britt	may sound but vim is superior nano is quick and dirty
2006-11-28T15:21:00.000Z	reverseblade	britt	how many colors do console support ?
2006-11-28T15:21:00.000Z	reverseblade	britt	16, console is for console
2006-11-28T15:22:00.000Z	britt	reverseblade	who said anything about colors?
2006-11-28T15:23:00.000Z	reverseblade	britt	I am trying to tell you can't expect everything from console, it has limitations and strengths, console is not a right place to seek for a full featured word process
2006-11-28T15:23:00.000Z	britt	reverseblade	worked in the 80s
2006-11-28T15:24:00.000Z	reverseblade	britt	like PW of DOS
2006-11-28T15:24:00.000Z	reverseblade	britt	you can install DOS box and try that old programs on it as well
2006-11-28T15:28:00.000Z	reverseblade	britt	I think no such editor exist for *nix
2006-11-29T11:05:00.000Z	reverseblade	britt	how top doesn't show it ?
2006-11-29T11:06:00.000Z	britt	reverseblade	i only see my naim session which is like 16%
2006-11-29T11:06:00.000Z	reverseblade	britt	tried ps  aux ?
2006-11-29T11:07:00.000Z	reverseblade	britt	when I run top, I can see the processes by root also
2006-11-29T11:19:00.000Z	britt	reverseblade	ps aux didnt list anything, but i killed my naim process and everything is good
2006-11-29T11:20:00.000Z	reverseblade	britt	how it didn't list anything ? ps is somewhat historical by the way ps aux --sort=gcpu | less sorts for cPU for example (ascending)
2006-11-29T11:21:00.000Z	britt	reverseblade	apparently that 25% was really like 78%
2006-11-29T11:22:00.000Z	reverseblade	britt	what 25 ?
2006-11-29T11:23:00.000Z	britt	reverseblade	nevermind. anyway that one process was using much more cpu than I noticed in top and ps
