2005-07-29T15:58:00.000Z	levander		Nobody has a recommendation on amanda vs. mondo?
2005-07-29T15:59:00.000Z	levander		any Linux utilities that can play DRM'd WMA files?
2005-07-29T15:59:00.000Z	Razor-X	levander	ewwwww
2005-08-02T06:13:00.000Z	Razor-X	levander	it got fixed
2005-08-03T13:21:00.000Z	Razor-X	levander	mkisofs I believe
2005-08-03T13:23:00.000Z	Razor-X	levander	hmmm, no, actually ;)
2005-12-10T10:40:00.000Z	Razor-X	levander	ah
2005-12-10T10:40:00.000Z	levander	Razor-X	ripping CD's to oggs
2005-12-10T10:32:00.000Z	levander	Razor-X	sudo is infinitely more convenient in my opinion, no having to be like 'oh yeah, i gotta switch in/out of su right now!!'
2005-12-10T10:32:00.000Z	Razor-X	levander	exactly, it used to get annoying constantly logging in and out
2005-12-10T10:32:00.000Z	Razor-X	levander	only thing is, for a while, it became muscle memory
2005-12-10T10:33:00.000Z	levander	Razor-X	for me, it was also like having to switch between insert and edit mode in vi, it was just a mental glitch you had to stop and remember to do occasionally
2005-12-10T10:34:00.000Z	Razor-X	levander	yeah, I was thinking of making an alias of ``sudo -s'' to ``su'', pretty fun that
2005-12-10T10:35:00.000Z	levander	Razor-X	i'd see a psychiatrist and ask if that meets the requirements for an OCD diagnosis, the medicines they dispense have saved lives
2005-12-10T10:35:00.000Z	Razor-X	levander	:P
2005-12-10T10:35:00.000Z	Razor-X	levander	mind me, I'm simply an impetuous youth *makes an innocent face*
2005-12-10T10:39:00.000Z	Razor-X	levander	what're those for?
2005-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	Razor-X	levander	I use a cd app to play them to stdout, and use flac to take stdin and play it into a FLAC file
2005-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	Razor-X	levander	of course, I have to repeat this for every track, but, it works
2005-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	Razor-X	levander	although, I'm thinking of trying a WAV player, if it can play a CD track (haven't experimented there yet)
2005-12-10T10:42:00.000Z	levander	Razor-X	grip automates the naming of the output files for me in a format i specify, and takes information out of cddb to name them
2005-12-10T10:42:00.000Z	Razor-X	levander	I guess that works
