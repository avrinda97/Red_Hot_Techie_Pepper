2006-06-15T12:22:00.000Z	chakra85_		can anyone help me with mysql?
2006-06-15T12:23:00.000Z	chakra85_		i just installed mysql-server and i'm trying to create a database
2006-06-15T12:23:00.000Z	chakra85_		but i keep getting "error: 'Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)'"
2006-06-15T12:24:00.000Z	n30n	chakra85_	you need a password
2006-06-15T12:24:00.000Z	chakra85_	n30n	so how do i set one?
2006-06-15T12:24:00.000Z	n30n	chakra85_	its the password for your root user. do you have one?
2006-06-15T12:24:00.000Z	chakra85_	n30n	i don't think i ever set one explicitly. is it the same password that I use when i sudo?
2006-06-15T12:25:00.000Z	n30n	chakra85_	try it.
2006-06-15T12:25:00.000Z	chakra85_	n30n	in what form? $ sudo mysqladmin password <pwd> create gallery2
2006-06-15T12:26:00.000Z	chakra85_	n30n	when i try that it gives me the same error
2006-06-15T12:26:00.000Z	n30n	chakra85_	that looks good. it should be $ sudo (what you are accessing) enter, and then it should ask you for password
2006-06-15T12:27:00.000Z	chakra85_	n30n	when i type "$sudo mysqladmin" it just lists the help for mysqladmin. i think i've already typed in the password once for this session
2006-06-15T12:28:00.000Z	n30n	chakra85_	what are you trying to do? create a mysql database?
2006-06-15T12:28:00.000Z	chakra85_	n30n	here's the output when i try something like "$sudo mysqladmin ping": mysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost' failed
2006-06-15T12:30:00.000Z	chakra85_	n30n	did you see that output? i can repaste it if you want
2006-06-15T12:30:00.000Z	n30n	chakra85_	Idk. It sounds like its not configured right.
2006-06-15T12:30:00.000Z	chakra85_	n30n	oh... any advice on how to configure it?
2006-06-15T12:30:00.000Z	n30n	chakra85_	try changing it from connecting to localhost to 127.0.0.1
2006-06-15T12:30:00.000Z	chakra85_	n30n	how do i do that?
2006-06-15T12:31:00.000Z	n30n	chakra85_	i don't remember give me a minute. But i know i had the problem with my website to with UNIX
2006-06-15T12:32:00.000Z	n30n	chakra85_	i don't think it knows where to go for "localhost" so if you make it connect to 127.0.0.1 (mirror ip) it will work
