2011-02-17T04:36:00.000Z	tim_		I'm having a problem with a fresh install of 10.10 netbook remix: The sidebar and top panel don't show up properly. There is 'negative space' where they should be, but no graphics. Anyone here familiar with this issue?
2011-02-17T04:36:00.000Z	freebse	tim_	I have the same issue with radeon
2011-02-17T04:37:00.000Z	freebse	tim_	it is a bug
2011-02-17T04:38:00.000Z	tim_	freebse	it could be a radeon card. There's an ATI sticker on teh computer, but 10.10 regular doesn't prompt for any special drivers, and looks fine.
2011-02-17T04:38:00.000Z	freebse		na ATI is lame, I never had problems with other cards
2011-02-17T04:38:00.000Z	freebse		since I have the ATI crad insinde my laptop compiz makes problems, I have font issues etc
2011-02-17T04:39:00.000Z	freebse		but I don't want to use closed source drivers, nv was much better
2011-02-17T04:40:00.000Z	tim_		Can I update the drivers at all, or is it a bust? Kind of weird, if I alt-tab, the graphics show up for a second.
2011-02-17T04:40:00.000Z	freebse		I fixed it by installing fglrx, but still it is a bug
2011-02-17T04:41:00.000Z	freebse		what about moving home, normally nothing breaks, just update it in fstab
2011-02-17T04:42:00.000Z	tim_	freebse	thanks, I'm installing that now, hopefully it's a fix.
2011-02-17T04:42:00.000Z	freebse	tim_	it does solve the problem at least it did over here, but still it is not a fix, it is a workaround
2011-02-17T04:43:00.000Z	tim_		Yeah, it should work out of the box. Really I just wanted to try the new interface. 10.10 is running fine.
2011-02-17T04:43:00.000Z	freebse		besides this netbook thing is beta status
2011-02-17T04:44:00.000Z	tim_	freebse	so what exactly is flgrx or what ever that was?
2011-02-17T04:44:00.000Z	freebse	tim_	the closed source graphic drivers from ati, what card do you have
2011-02-17T04:45:00.000Z	tim_		I don't know what card I have, since 10.10 doesn't report it. Is there an easy way to check from the shell?
2011-02-17T04:46:00.000Z	tim_	freebse	I figured I'd see an option for ATI drivers on the additional driver window, but it only came up with stuff for my wireless card.
2011-02-17T04:47:00.000Z	freebse	tim_	lspci
2011-02-17T04:48:00.000Z	freebse		what it does not exist ?
2011-02-17T04:48:00.000Z	freebse		lol, I have debian and just thought damn they even removed that :)
2011-02-17T04:48:00.000Z	tim_	freebse	I got that, thanks :) It reports back that it's an ATI SB600? <-never heard of that.
