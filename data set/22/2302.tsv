2009-07-23T04:53:00.000Z	jdu	jurgs	does it appear with:  sudo sfdisk -l
2009-07-23T04:54:00.000Z	jurgs	jdu	no i have tried doing that and it doesn't detect anything
2009-07-23T04:54:00.000Z	jdu	jurgs	does the bios report it?
2009-07-23T04:56:00.000Z	jurgs	jdu	not sure I can chose to boot from hard drive but it only gives me one option, I have an intel i815 mobo
2009-07-23T04:56:00.000Z	jdu	jurgs	sometimes the bios or the jumpers may be configured in such a way that it won't tell linux it exists; does win98 see it?
2009-07-23T04:58:00.000Z	jurgs	jdu	yes, ok i did sudo sfdisk -l and it shows up as /dev/sdb1 i guess i was spelling something wrong
2009-07-23T04:58:00.000Z	jdu	jurgs	so, yes, you can mount it then :)
2009-07-23T04:58:00.000Z	jurgs	jdu	but how?
2009-07-23T04:59:00.000Z	jdu	jurgs	what file system is it?  where would you like it to be mounted?
2009-07-23T04:59:00.000Z	jdu	jurgs	does it not show up in gnome?
2009-07-23T05:00:00.000Z	jurgs	jdu	it is a FAT 32 and it doesn't matter where it is mounted, I'm just trying to mount it to install a fresh distro
2009-07-23T05:01:00.000Z	jdu	jurgs	hmm.  so:  mount -t fat /dev/sdb1 /your/mount/point
2009-07-23T05:03:00.000Z	jdu	jurgs	not, sure, that's really designed for usb sticks.  Why not do an actual install?
2009-07-23T05:05:00.000Z	jurgs	jdu	my cd drive is busted, is there a way to install on my master drive then?
2009-07-23T05:08:00.000Z	jurgs	jdu	thanks for the help, i will try this on another day
2009-07-23T05:08:00.000Z	jdu	jurgs	ok, sorry if I could have helped more
2009-07-23T05:09:00.000Z	jurgs	jdu	your help was greatly appreciated
