2008-02-16T04:01:00.000Z	Malachi		Is there any way I can send a message to someone over SSH? I need a GUI dialogue box to appear.
2008-02-16T04:01:00.000Z	kbrooks	Malachi	yes
2008-02-16T04:01:00.000Z	Malachi	kbrooks	Oh, great. Do you know how?
2008-02-16T04:01:00.000Z	kbrooks	Malachi	there is a way which exploits a security vulnerability in ssh (which unfortunately is a bit too impractical to fix)
2008-02-16T04:02:00.000Z	Malachi	kbrooks	Oh really? Ew. I smell Net Send problems if Linux gets a bit more mainstream....
2008-02-16T04:02:00.000Z	kbrooks	Malachi	the remote host linux or windows please
2008-02-16T04:02:00.000Z	Malachi	kbrooks	Both are Linux machines running Ubuntu.
2008-02-16T04:03:00.000Z	kbrooks	Malachi	not so hard to do, here's the link ... (grabbing it)
2008-02-16T04:04:00.000Z	kbrooks	Malachi	http://www.hackinglinuxexposed.com/articles/20040608.html
2008-02-16T04:05:00.000Z	Malachi	kbrooks	Slart, thanks to the both of you.
2008-02-16T04:05:00.000Z	kbrooks	Malachi	the way to fix that is at the source, which is YOU. NEVER use X11 forwarding on servers that you don't trust that have X11
2008-02-16T04:06:00.000Z	Malachi	kbrooks	Okay, thanks. I just need it to send a message to one of my clients since he doesn't use IM software.
2008-02-16T04:06:00.000Z	kbrooks	Malachi	ssh -x user@host to disable X11 forwarding, iirc
2008-02-16T04:09:00.000Z	kbrooks	Malachi	be aware again that with the ingenuity as demostrated in that article a server owner can do unethical things to you if you a) have X (if you see a GUI login screen when you boot, you probably do) and b) haven't disabled X forwarding
2008-02-16T04:10:00.000Z	kbrooks	Malachi	I'll leave it at that
2008-02-16T04:10:00.000Z	Malachi	kbrooks	Yeah, thanks for the warning. Actually, I have a copy of that book. I don't remember reading that....
2008-02-16T04:11:00.000Z	kbrooks	Malachi	and you may be observant enough to conclude that X security is VERY primitive
2008-02-16T04:12:00.000Z	Malachi	kbrooks	Mm. I'd think it'd be more secure than what it looks like....
2008-02-16T04:12:00.000Z	Malachi	kbrooks	I suppose since a lot of servers don't run X, it's not TOO significant, but still....
2008-02-16T04:13:00.000Z	kbrooks	Malachi	BTW there is ##security to discuss security
2008-02-16T04:14:00.000Z	Malachi	kbrooks	Oh, nice insinuation. I'm leaving anyway.
2008-02-16T04:14:00.000Z	kbrooks	Malachi	bye :-)
