2006-11-03T16:03:00.000Z	OoberMick	Chinesefood	So is it a windows problem then?
2006-11-03T16:04:00.000Z	Chinesefood		oobermick: yup..typical thing
2006-11-03T16:05:00.000Z	Chinesefood		oobermick: any ideas?
2006-11-03T16:06:00.000Z	Chinesefood		firefoxman: tell them that edubuntu comes bundled with strictly educational software and is free
2006-11-03T16:06:00.000Z	OoberMick	Chinesefood	It's hard to tell.. do you are another linux box (or maybe just a live cd)? If you did then you could check that printing from that worked.
2006-11-03T16:08:00.000Z	Chinesefood		oobermick: nope but im convinced that its windows because it can print locally from ubuntu
2006-11-03T16:09:00.000Z	OoberMick	Chinesefood	I've never tried printing windows->linux so I don't know. Perhaps you should find a windows irc channel and ask around that
2006-11-03T16:10:00.000Z	Chinesefood		oobermick: lol windows users wouldnt know...the majority are very simple beings :P
2006-11-03T16:11:00.000Z	Chinesefood		oobermick: thanks anyways man
2006-11-03T16:11:00.000Z	OoberMick	Chinesefood	I'm sure there must be some clever ones somewhere.
2006-11-03T16:11:00.000Z	Chinesefood		firefoxman: what do you need help with?
2006-11-03T16:11:00.000Z	OoberMick	Chinesefood	np
