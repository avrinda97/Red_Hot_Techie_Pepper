2007-05-25T16:52:00.000Z	Pelo	DavidCraft	 running   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg might slove the problem
2007-05-31T10:36:00.000Z	Pelo	DavidCraft	you probably have to specify user permissons in samba
2007-05-31T10:36:00.000Z	Pelo	DavidCraft	try asking in #samba

2007-05-31T10:36:00.000Z	Pelo	DavidCraft	 there might be some help in this  http://book.opensourceproject.org.cn/distrib/ubuntu/unleashed/
2007-06-06T07:31:00.000Z	Pelo	DavidCraft	 sudo apt-get install  ubuntu-desktop
2007-09-12T06:27:00.000Z	Pelo	DavidCraft	 do a search for the error msg in the forum and in google , I'm sure you'll find a fix
2007-09-12T06:27:00.000Z	DavidCraft	Pelo	thanks for the AWSOME tip...
2007-09-12T06:29:00.000Z	Pelo	DavidCraft	 if you have some problems with grub after ward let me know , I've done this a few times
2007-09-12T06:31:00.000Z	Pelo	DavidCraft	 what bit are you doing exactly ?
2007-09-12T06:32:00.000Z	DavidCraft	Pelo	I accedently filled the disk I was on
2007-09-12T06:32:00.000Z	Pelo	DavidCraft	how did you accidently do this ?
2007-09-12T06:34:00.000Z	Pelo	DavidCraft	empty the trash can, if you can't from the desktop,  go to  /home/user/.Trash , and /root/.Trash
2007-09-12T06:34:00.000Z	Pelo	DavidCraft	shift+del deletes permanently
2007-09-12T06:36:00.000Z	DavidCraft	Pelo	/home/user/.Trash is empty, and /root/.Trash does not exist.  I deleted 51 MB in packages via apt-get remove, and then I rm'ed about 60 mb off my desktop.  Issuing the fd -h still shows 0 free space
2007-09-12T06:36:00.000Z	Pelo	DavidCraft	sudo apt-get autocleawn
2007-09-12T06:37:00.000Z	Pelo	DavidCraft	 if you want /root/.Trash you have to be root
2007-09-12T06:38:00.000Z	DavidCraft	Pelo	I am root, and the autoclean didnt seam to do anything
2007-09-12T06:40:00.000Z	Pelo	DavidCraft	can you start synaptic ?   select  status in the lower left corner there are two sections where you can "finalise" deletion of stuff
