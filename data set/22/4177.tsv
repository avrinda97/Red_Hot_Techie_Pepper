2008-03-03T12:32:00.000Z	hwilde	hischild	I think he has to fix mbr first, then fix the partition table, then fix grub.  if gparted doesn't even see the partitions then there is something else wrong
2008-03-03T12:32:00.000Z	hischild	hwilde	as far as i know supergrub can do that all at the same time
2008-03-03T13:41:00.000Z	hischild	hwilde	nothing is complicated as long as you understand it ... as soon as you don't understand something it becomes very complicated
2008-03-03T14:49:00.000Z	hwilde	hischild	apt-get install tofrodos;   dos2unix filename
2008-03-03T14:49:00.000Z	hischild	hwilde	tnx
2008-03-03T14:52:00.000Z	hwilde	hischild	apt-get install tofrodos;   dos2unix filename
2008-03-03T14:52:00.000Z	hischild	hwilde	yes did that :-)
2008-03-03T14:52:00.000Z	hischild	hwilde	works <3
2008-03-03T14:56:00.000Z	hischild	hwilde	the line endings were my problem which dos2unix fixed
2008-03-03T14:56:00.000Z	hwilde	hischild	actually it converts the file format... you could run into problems especially in web browsers
2008-03-03T14:57:00.000Z	hischild	hwilde	php parser has to read it and that ran into trouble with the windows line ednigs
2008-04-11T21:08:00.000Z	hischild	hwilde	 assuming it's the same solution on gutsy and hardy, i'd say let him stay. Until there's a point that it actually makes a difference then i'd say go switch.
2008-04-11T21:08:00.000Z	hwilde	hischild	i know but bazhang is on edge
2008-04-11T21:16:00.000Z	hischild	hwilde	you still have the !lnw factoid

2008-12-22T20:33:00.000Z	hischild	hwilde	Thank you loads.
2008-12-22T20:34:00.000Z	hwilde	hischild	I just googled  microphone +ubuntu     first couple links
2008-12-22T20:34:00.000Z	hischild	hwilde	googled as well, but couldn't find it ...
2008-12-22T20:35:00.000Z	hwilde	hischild	google "microphone +ubuntu"   the first link I gave you is the first link.  the second link is about 6 down
2008-12-22T20:37:00.000Z	hischild	hwilde	yes i see those. Might have something to do that i need it to forward its info via pulseaudio as well.
