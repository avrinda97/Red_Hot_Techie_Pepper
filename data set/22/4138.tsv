2008-08-29T08:07:00.000Z	gregbrady		So, no way to install my sound card?  Which is an AC97?
2008-08-29T08:08:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gregbrady	 i was thinking ac97 wasent really a 'card' but like a standard  - But i have had few sound issues with my machines.
2008-08-29T08:08:00.000Z	gregbrady	Dr_willis	my card is described as SB400 AC'97
2008-08-29T08:09:00.000Z	gregbrady	Dr_willis	make any sense?  No?
2008-08-29T08:09:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gregbrady	 i would check google for linux/ubuntu and the SB400 then. and the ubuntu forums perhaps.  Its possible theres buggy drivers for that card.
2008-08-29T08:10:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gregbrady	 its like the old days perhaps when cards where 'sound blaster compatiable' :) but a lot of them were only compatiable due to their drivers.
2008-08-29T08:11:00.000Z	gregbrady	Dr_willis	no problem, I looked and no luck...not an issue....back to XP for this machine.
2008-08-29T08:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gregbrady	 if its very new. it may be the next ubuntu release will update the alsa drivers and get sound working..  or it maybe some trivial fix. I dont know your details so cant advise any more then that.
2008-08-29T08:13:00.000Z	gregbrady	Dr_willis	not a problem.  This is an older machine and I just thought it would be a good match for Ubuntu.  Video worked, but not audio.  Back to what works.  Thanks for the suggestions and help though.
2008-08-29T08:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gregbrady	 i grabbed a $20 creative sound card the other day that works like a champ in the wifes box. :)
2008-08-29T08:14:00.000Z	gregbrady	Dr_willis	nope, XP is free.  Everything works there.  Thanks.
2008-08-29T08:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gregbrady	 'free' in a 'very broad sence' ;)
2008-08-29T08:14:00.000Z	gregbrady	Dr_willis	it came with the machine free
2008-08-29T08:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gregbrady	  which is to say - you paid the 'microsoft tax'
2008-08-29T08:15:00.000Z	gregbrady	Dr_willis	yup, but it works
2008-08-29T08:19:00.000Z	gregbrady	Dr_willis	I will switch back, but continue to monitor Linux development until the succeed in getting their wireless and audio drivers to work properly.......it seems Linux weakness.
2008-08-29T08:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gregbrady	 its a weakness of the HARDWARE makers - not linux. If they dont support linux - then linux cant support them.
2008-08-29T08:23:00.000Z	gregbrady	Dr_willis	I understand, but from a users standpoint, it is a Linux weakness.  I hope to switch over soon though.!
2008-08-29T08:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gregbrady	 from this users standpoint its a hardware makers stupidty issue.  and ive explained it to many a 'windows user' at work. :)
2008-08-29T08:25:00.000Z	gregbrady	Dr_willis	I understand 100%.  But as a user, if my hardware does not work, I cannot wait for the manufacturer to change.  I have to go with what he supports.  The way I bought it.
2008-08-29T08:27:00.000Z	gregbrady	Dr_willis	In other words...my fault for not buying Linux compatible hardware.
2008-08-29T08:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gregbrady	 my last laptop works better in linux then it does in vista. :) HP cant even get their own hardware support right with it..
