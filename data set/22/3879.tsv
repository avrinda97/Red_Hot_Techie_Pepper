2008-05-05T18:04:00.000Z	negge^	noob-africa_	have you had a look at this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=205449
2008-05-05T18:04:00.000Z	noob-africa_	negge^	clicking it brings up --> No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found
2008-05-05T18:05:00.000Z	negge^	noob-africa_	go to System --> Preferences --> Sound
2008-05-05T18:05:00.000Z	negge^	noob-africa_	there you can test your sound
