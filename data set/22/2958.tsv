2009-01-11T23:02:00.000Z	style-instalasjo		Hello
2009-01-11T23:02:00.000Z	style-instalasjo		I am converting from debian etch to ubuntu
2009-01-11T23:02:00.000Z	style-instalasjo		Anything I should take into consideration? I have backed up the installed packages list, and the home folders.
2009-01-11T23:04:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	style-instalasjo	Anything in /var/cache/ or /var/lib/ or /var/log/ you might want to keep/refer to?
2009-01-11T23:04:00.000Z	style-instalasjo	IntuitiveNipple	Doubtfull. I am moving mainly because I want USB to auto mount, and I want the latest programs.
2009-01-11T23:06:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	style-instalasjo	ok - I was thinking of things such as mythtv, that leave the recordings in /var/lib/mythtv/recordings/
2009-01-11T23:06:00.000Z	style-instalasjo	IntuitiveNipple	Oh, I don't think I have anything there...
2009-01-11T23:07:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	style-instalasjo	OK... never nice to find out you missed something *after* :D
2009-01-11T23:07:00.000Z	style-instalasjo	IntuitiveNipple	No.. Thanks for the heads up.
2009-01-11T23:08:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	style-instalasjo	Did you lose the device-mapper driver maybe?
2009-01-11T23:09:00.000Z	style-instalasjo	IntuitiveNipple	Like with a kernel update? That is possible. But shouldn't it still show up in POST?
2009-01-11T23:09:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	style-instalasjo	Is it based on a raw partition, or on LVM ?
2009-01-11T23:11:00.000Z	style-instalasjo	IntuitiveNipple	I don't know... But the whole disk is fully encrypted
2009-01-11T23:12:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	style-instalasjo	Is it a single disk or RAID ? (I use both RAID5 on LVM and RAID1 on raw, LUKS key-file protected)
2009-01-11T23:12:00.000Z	style-instalasjo	IntuitiveNipple	Single disk
2009-01-11T23:13:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	style-instalasjo	If fdisk can no longer 'see' the partition that sounds like something has over-written the partition table and removed an entry?
2009-01-11T23:13:00.000Z	style-instalasjo	IntuitiveNipple	It can't 'see' the entire disk.
2009-01-11T23:13:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	style-instalasjo	Hmmm... bad cable? non-standard driver missing?
2009-01-11T23:14:00.000Z	style-instalasjo	IntuitiveNipple	Cable works fine with other disk.
2009-01-11T23:15:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	style-instalasjo	without being in front of that system then, it is hard to diagnose further.
2009-01-11T23:16:00.000Z	style-instalasjo	IntuitiveNipple	So nothing I can do?
2009-01-11T23:17:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	style-instalasjo	Well, yes, *you* can continue investigating but there are so many fundamental things that *could* lose a disk unless you can pin it down further there's not alot can be done/suggested remotely. Right now, it sounds like you've got a physical disk drive gone AWOL - check power, cables, etc. and go on from there.
