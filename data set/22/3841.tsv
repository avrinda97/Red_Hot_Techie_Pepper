2011-06-23T15:22:00.000Z	hroi		hello
2011-06-23T15:23:00.000Z	hroi		I just wen to download myself the latest ubuntu 64bit iso
2011-06-23T15:24:00.000Z	hroi		the website gave me a file called ... ...desktop_amd64.iso
2011-06-23T15:24:00.000Z	hroi		however Im going to use this on an intel core 2
2011-06-23T15:24:00.000Z	dr_Willis	hroi	 so?
2011-06-23T15:24:00.000Z	hroi	dr_Willis	right, but why name it amd64 ??
2011-06-23T15:25:00.000Z	hroi	dr_Willis	why name the distro iso amd
2011-06-23T15:25:00.000Z	hroi	dr_Willis	I doubt amd was the first to produce a 64bit processor.
2011-06-23T15:27:00.000Z	hroi	dr_Willis	ok so this distro also has binaries optimized for the intel I guess.
2011-06-23T15:29:00.000Z	hroi	dr_Willis	ok goog to know, thought that the distro would at least pick out an optimized kernel for my cpu
2011-06-23T15:34:00.000Z	hroi	dr_Willis	is there any difference package repository wise between ubuntu desktop and ubuntu server ?
2011-06-23T15:34:00.000Z	dr_Willis	hroi	no
2011-06-23T15:34:00.000Z	hroi	dr_Willis	I would like to use the server version, but worry that it uses less current packages.
2011-06-23T15:35:00.000Z	dr_Willis	hroi	why use server. you want a gui?
2011-06-23T15:35:00.000Z	hroi	dr_Willis	I want x window support and remote desktop support.
2011-06-23T15:36:00.000Z	dr_Willis	hroi	 use desktop then
2011-06-23T15:36:00.000Z	hroi	dr_Willis	ok, however, this will be a multi-user "Server" type setup.
2011-06-23T15:37:00.000Z	dr_Willis	hroi	 wont matter
2011-06-23T15:37:00.000Z	hroi	dr_Willis	ok, so no difference in how the kernel is configured to run...
2011-06-23T15:38:00.000Z	dr_Willis	hroi	some little things but probely nothing to worry about
2011-06-23T15:38:00.000Z	hroi	dr_Willis	I have heard rumours that distros like Ubuntu, tweek the kernels
2011-06-23T15:41:00.000Z	hroi	dr_Willis	thanks!
