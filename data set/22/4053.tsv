2008-03-31T15:51:00.000Z	mactimes	Tootbatot_	You want to limit bandwidth for computers on the network, right?
2008-03-31T15:52:00.000Z	Tootbatot_	mactimes	yes
2008-03-31T15:52:00.000Z	Tootbatot_	mactimes	yes
2008-03-31T15:53:00.000Z	mactimes	Tootbatot_	Shaper can control bandwidth for single host ip, entire subnets, ports, etc.
2008-03-31T15:53:00.000Z	mactimes	Tootbatot_	sudo apt-get install shaper
2008-03-31T15:53:00.000Z	Tootbatot_	mactimes	it can do the combined ip limiting too?\

2008-03-31T15:54:00.000Z	mactimes	Tootbatot_	You're welcome.
2008-03-31T15:54:00.000Z	Tootbatot_	mactimes	do i need wondershaper or some packet shapper. ? whats the need
2008-03-31T15:55:00.000Z	mactimes	Tootbatot_	Just do a simple:  sudo apt-get install shaper
2008-03-31T15:55:00.000Z	mactimes	Tootbatot_	Then you have to define traffic shaping classes under /etc/shaper
2008-03-31T15:55:00.000Z	Tootbatot_	mactimes	k
2008-03-31T15:56:00.000Z	mactimes	Tootbatot_	That's all.
