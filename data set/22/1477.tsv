2012-05-23T05:42:00.000Z	Drecondius		Ok, so I'm back again, Inside a Live environment whereas there is no option on a 12.04 disc to run a repair. Perhaps someone can help me with repairing my grub on an efi install
2012-05-23T05:42:00.000Z	Drecondius		!ask AnthonyKK
2012-05-23T05:44:00.000Z	Drecondius		Anybody have any advice on how to repair a botched grub install from inside a live environment?
2012-05-23T05:46:00.000Z	Drecondius		Grub still gives me a pain in the !!!
2012-05-23T05:47:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Drecondius	I've already sent you a link to how to fix it
2012-05-23T05:48:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Drecondius	I don't think there was enough room on the live-cd to include it, but the instructions are fairly straight forward.
2012-05-23T05:49:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Drecondius	if you use firefox from the live-cd, you can even copy-paste a fair bit of it
2012-05-23T10:58:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Drecondius	did you set up nomodeset on the installed grub as well?
2012-05-23T10:59:00.000Z	Drecondius	DarwinSurvivor	That's the only way i can get a semi workable installation going. "Failed to load device in PCI 1.0.0" or something to that nature
2012-05-23T11:00:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Drecondius	what video card is it?
2012-05-23T11:01:00.000Z	Drecondius	DarwinSurvivor	Geforce GTX 550ti
2012-05-23T11:03:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Drecondius	http://askubuntu.com/questions/127305/how-to-install-ubuntu-12-04-on-a-computer-with-a-nvidia-geforce-gtx-550-ti has a few tips that may help
2012-05-23T11:04:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Drecondius	also, does switching to a TTY interface work?
2012-05-23T11:04:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Drecondius	yes
2012-05-23T11:05:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Drecondius	have you tried installing the binary drivers?
2012-05-23T11:06:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Drecondius	when did it download and install it?
2012-05-23T11:07:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Drecondius	ubuntu will not automatically install the binary video card drivers, that must be done manually (either via cli or the "restricted drivers" tool in the GUI)
2012-05-23T11:12:00.000Z	Drecondius	DarwinSurvivor	I understand your concern but at this point I'm about ready to start sacraficing gnomes to please whatever delights in such misery :D
2012-05-23T11:14:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Drecondius	go with the wiki page, that is the *official* installation method. I've seen way too many people hose their systems by following how-to's on peoples' blogs
2012-05-23T11:18:00.000Z	Drecondius	DarwinSurvivor	I can't do half of what the wiki is telling me because they require X to actually be running.
2012-05-23T11:19:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Drecondius	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia#Installation_without_X_.2BAC8_from_the_console
2012-05-23T11:20:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Drecondius	or go with Chuck_Norris's one (simpler)
