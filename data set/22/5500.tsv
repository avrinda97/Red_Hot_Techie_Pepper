2007-04-22T11:59:00.000Z	Delco2		he debaser
2007-04-22T12:00:00.000Z	|ringo|	Delco2	how much ram do you have?
2007-04-22T12:04:00.000Z	|ringo|	Delco2	w/ less than 192MB ram, the livecd doesnt boot, but that obviously isnt your problem.  Have you tried booting into safe graphics mode?
2007-04-22T12:04:00.000Z	Delco2	|ringo|	yes I have tried safe graph mode.
2007-04-22T12:04:00.000Z	|ringo|	Delco2	what video card do you have
2007-04-22T12:05:00.000Z	Delco2	|ringo|	its an onboard Intel
2007-04-22T12:05:00.000Z	|ringo|	Delco2	ok well first select the option to check disk for errors
2007-04-22T12:05:00.000Z	Delco2	|ringo|	yes i've tried that and it freezes.
2007-04-22T12:06:00.000Z	|ringo|	Delco2	if there are no errors, try 6.10 or 7.04 and see if that livecd works.  if not, download the alternate cd which is a text  based installer.
2007-04-22T12:06:00.000Z	|ringo|	Delco2	oh well if you try the check disk and it freezes then your burn is messed up
2007-04-22T12:07:00.000Z	|ringo|	Delco2	You need to do an md5sum on your downloaded iso and see if it matches the md5sum on ubuntu's website. if they dont match, your download failed. if they do match, just reburn the cd and try again
2007-04-22T12:12:00.000Z	Delco2	|ringo|	still here?
2007-04-22T12:13:00.000Z	|ringo|	Delco2	yeah but im laggy
2007-04-22T12:13:00.000Z	|ringo|	Delco2	hmmm not sure about nomda
2007-04-22T12:14:00.000Z	|ringo|	Delco2	sure its not "noDMA"?
2007-04-22T12:14:00.000Z	Delco2	|ringo|	yes. but its command line was nodma. probably the same thing
2007-04-22T12:15:00.000Z	Delco2	|ringo|	what would I type at boot: to get the equivelent? boot: live noMDA ???
2007-04-22T12:17:00.000Z	Delco2	|ringo|	what would I type at boot: to get the equivelent? boot: live noMDA ???
2007-04-22T12:17:00.000Z	|ringo|	Delco2	sorry, im lagging.  I dont know what switch to use thats comparable to your other distro
2007-04-22T12:17:00.000Z	Delco2	|ringo|	ok. thanks
2007-04-22T12:20:00.000Z	|ringo|	Delco2	try sticking ide=nodma  or just nodma to the end of your boot parameters
