2006-07-16T14:14:00.000Z	timbobsteve	mikeymike-linux	and what seems to be the problem with this fstab file ?
2006-07-16T14:15:00.000Z	timbobsteve	mikeymike-linux	i noticed the umask settings in there... I wasn't aware that fstab took calls to umask
2006-07-16T14:15:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux	timbobsteve	does it? or not?
2006-07-16T14:16:00.000Z	timbobsteve	mikeymike-linux	not to my knowledge... I think there is other syntax
2006-07-16T14:16:00.000Z	timbobsteve	mikeymike-linux	2 seconds I will scoure man fstab ;)
2006-07-16T14:18:00.000Z	timbobsteve	mikeymike-linux	check out the options for "man mount".... they are the options you can use for the fourth field in /etc/fstab.... umask isn't one of them
2006-07-16T14:18:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux	timbobsteve	okay
2006-07-16T14:19:00.000Z	timbobsteve	mikeymike-linux	wait... my appologies... further down in man it is an option.... but I am not sure it works with /etc/fstab
2006-07-16T14:19:00.000Z	timbobsteve	mikeymike-linux	do you want to set them (file mounts) to read-only ?
2006-07-16T14:20:00.000Z	mikeymike-linux	timbobsteve	of course because they are only ntfs
