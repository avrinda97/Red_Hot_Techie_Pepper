2007-02-08T10:16:00.000Z	piedoggie	phiqtion	don't worry about the boot loader, it will be detected (usually) and you should be all set to dual boot
2007-02-08T10:16:00.000Z	piedoggie		it meaning the Windows partition
2007-02-08T10:17:00.000Z	phiqtion	piedoggie	but will GRUB be installed to MBR automatically? i want window's bootloader to stay on MBR and from there, i can launch UBuntu's GRUB
2007-02-08T10:18:00.000Z	piedoggie		 phiqtion yes  grub  will be installed on the MBR  but you'll have two entries, one for ubuntu the other for Windows
2007-02-08T10:18:00.000Z	phiqtion	piedoggie	can i choose where i want GRUB to be installed?
2007-02-08T10:19:00.000Z	phiqtion	piedoggie	can i choose where i want GRUB to be installed?
2007-02-08T10:19:00.000Z	piedoggie	phiqtion	I believe you can.  I just did an install and I seem to remember something about it installing it in a partition as well as mbr.  But seriously, why?
2007-02-08T10:20:00.000Z	piedoggie		I've been doing this for way too many years (Red Hat 3.03) and whenever I let grub be smart, it usually wins.  If I try to be smart, I do a reinstall
2007-02-08T10:20:00.000Z	phiqtion	piedoggie	because now i believe, GRUB doesn't recognize VISTA or MACOSX86. my vista has everything setup in the bootloader to launch XP, LINUX, and MAC
2007-02-08T10:21:00.000Z	piedoggie		so the question is phiqtion, are you smarter than me?  :-)
2007-02-08T10:22:00.000Z	piedoggie	phiqtion	I see, it's the Microsoft trying to own the world model.  It looks like they finally got smart to the boot loader issue.
2007-02-08T10:22:00.000Z	phiqtion	piedoggie	because when i start Ubuntu it says something about TTY not being found, any thoughts?
2007-02-08T10:22:00.000Z	piedoggie		I would suggest doing the install up to the point of installing the boot code.  If it doesn't do is you want, then back off until you can find what you need
2007-02-08T10:23:00.000Z	phiqtion	piedoggie	so im gonna reiinstall
2007-02-08T10:23:00.000Z	piedoggie		as for the TTY message, that must be happening really early in the boot process
2007-02-08T10:23:00.000Z	phiqtion	piedoggie	yes it is
2007-02-08T10:23:00.000Z	piedoggie		I would suspect a problem with init
2007-02-08T10:23:00.000Z	piedoggie		which is definitely a reinstall time
2007-02-08T10:23:00.000Z	piedoggie		which distribution are you trying to install?
2007-02-08T10:23:00.000Z	phiqtion	piedoggie	yeah, 6.10
