2007-08-13T07:42:00.000Z	scipio	TylerJGillies	fsck in terminal might help
2007-08-13T07:42:00.000Z	TylerJGillies	scipio	thanx
2007-08-13T07:43:00.000Z	TylerJGillies	scipio	its a ntfs file system, doesn't fsck only work with linux?
2007-08-13T07:43:00.000Z	TylerJGillies	scipio	im trying to check my windows filesystem to resize it cause ntfsresize won't let me
2007-08-13T07:44:00.000Z	TylerJGillies	scipio	says i need to run chkdsk first
2007-08-13T07:44:00.000Z	scipio	TylerJGillies	ah
2007-08-13T07:45:00.000Z	scipio	TylerJGillies	resizing an existing windows partition might cause data loss. you would want to defrag it first
2007-08-13T07:45:00.000Z	TylerJGillies	scipio	already did that
2007-08-13T07:46:00.000Z	scipio	TylerJGillies	hmm. then resize it with gparted, from a livecd? back up your data though :)
2007-08-13T07:47:00.000Z	TylerJGillies	scipio	im running an ubuntu livecd to speak in here
2007-08-13T07:48:00.000Z	scipio	TylerJGillies	are you trying to install ubuntu? it will let you run gparted during the install process
2007-08-13T07:49:00.000Z	TylerJGillies	scipio	it gives me an error when it tries to resize, its not very verbose, thats why im trying to do it from the command line
2007-08-13T07:53:00.000Z	TylerJGillies	scipio	oh the default partition tool in install isn't gparted is it?
2007-08-13T07:54:00.000Z	scipio	TylerJGillies	honestly i can't remember. i was looking for some info right now. i installed it on my system several times with partioning in the process but never had problems
2007-08-13T07:55:00.000Z	scipio	TylerJGillies	maybe if you remember the error message so we can look it up?
2007-08-13T07:58:00.000Z	TylerJGillies	scipio	the error message is that it failed to resize, thats why i'm even asking is because the error message sucks. my original question was where do i find chkdsk for ubuntu because it doesn't come on the install cd. i think chkdsk will fix the problem
2007-08-13T08:02:00.000Z	scipio	TylerJGillies	the problem is you can't run chkdsk to check a ntfs partition from linux. you need an Windows XP cd
2007-08-13T08:02:00.000Z	TylerJGillies	scipio	i learned that from google 5 seconds before you said that heh
2007-08-13T08:02:00.000Z	TylerJGillies	scipio	oh well time to --force ;)
2007-08-13T08:02:00.000Z	scipio	TylerJGillies	dangerous :P good luck :)
2007-08-13T08:03:00.000Z	TylerJGillies	scipio	reformat is my middle name! ... er I mean dangerous
