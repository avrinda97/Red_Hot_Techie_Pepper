2005-06-14T12:52:00.000Z	Jet2k5		hello
2005-06-14T12:53:00.000Z	Jet2k5		can someone help me?  I'm having some serious problem with my internet
2005-06-14T12:53:00.000Z	kvidell	Jet2k5	What kinds of problems?
2005-06-14T12:53:00.000Z	Jet2k5	kvidell	well for one my internet is no longer working under ubuntu
2005-06-14T12:54:00.000Z	kvidell		wired or wireless?
2005-06-14T12:54:00.000Z	Jet2k5	kvidell	it keeps on saying that there is an error in name resolution
2005-06-14T12:54:00.000Z	kvidell		ah.. what does your /etc/resolv.conf look like?
2005-06-14T12:54:00.000Z	Jet2k5		I'm on windows right now
2005-06-14T12:54:00.000Z	Jet2k5		but yes I'm able to ping things
2005-06-14T12:54:00.000Z	Jet2k5		not domain names
2005-06-14T12:54:00.000Z	Jet2k5		only physical addresses
2005-06-14T12:55:00.000Z	Jet2k5		like 192.168.1.1
2005-06-14T12:55:00.000Z	Jet2k5		and 194.90.1.5
2005-06-14T12:55:00.000Z	kvidell		You'll want to make sure your resolv.conf is clean then. If there's a "search" line at the top of it I'd recomend removing that and seeing if that fixes it. If you need some good hard DNS servers to try, I use 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2
2005-06-14T12:55:00.000Z	kvidell		They'll need to be on a line that starts with "nameserver "
2005-06-14T12:55:00.000Z	kvidell		save and try pinging again.
2005-06-14T12:57:00.000Z	Jet2k5		hold on guys brbr
2005-06-14T13:14:00.000Z	kvidell		sudo ntpdate time.nist.gov
2005-06-14T13:14:00.000Z	kvidell		:-P
2005-06-14T13:22:00.000Z	Jet2k5	kvidell	anyhow sorry but can you message me what you said
2005-06-14T13:23:00.000Z	Jet2k5		I had to run out and do something and I lost it
