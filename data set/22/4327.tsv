2008-01-27T10:05:00.000Z	Breakage		Hi, I'm trying to stream a divx file from stage6 though mplayer without firefox just using mplayer>open>play url.., divx files from the hdd work fine with mplayer. but when i try to steam it just freezes and i have to kill it. how do i fix this
2008-01-27T10:05:00.000Z	spdf	Breakage	no error on the command line?
2008-01-27T10:05:00.000Z	Breakage	spdf	hold on, ill check
2008-01-27T10:07:00.000Z	Breakage	spdf	yeah, ill pastebin the error.
2008-01-27T10:08:00.000Z	Breakage	spdf	this is what im getting, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/53638/
2008-01-27T10:15:00.000Z	spdf	Breakage	try playing the stream with... mplayer -vo xv <url>
2008-01-27T10:15:00.000Z	Breakage	spdf	ok :)
2008-01-27T10:18:00.000Z	Breakage	spdf	worked fine thanks how could i add this cmd to mplayer?
2008-01-27T10:19:00.000Z	spdf	Breakage	/etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf
2008-01-27T10:19:00.000Z	Breakage	spdf	thanks again :D
2008-01-27T10:19:00.000Z	spdf	Breakage	there'll likely be a commented line "vo=xv", just uncomment, or add it youself
2008-01-27T10:19:00.000Z	spdf	Breakage	np
2008-01-27T10:30:00.000Z	Breakage	spdf	hmm, strange it was already commented out under /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf but when i load it under Multimedia>Mplayer movie player "gmplayer". Still freezes.
2008-01-27T10:44:00.000Z	Breakage	spdf	this is my .conf, it still crashes though http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/53640/
2008-01-27T10:45:00.000Z	spdf	Breakage	strange.. considering it worked from the command line
2008-01-27T10:46:00.000Z	spdf	Breakage	check .mplayer/config, there may be something overiding it
2008-01-27T10:46:00.000Z	Breakage	spdf	ok :)
2008-01-27T10:47:00.000Z	spdf	Breakage	otherwise, all I can suggest is doing it like that at the commandline when you want to play those streams
2008-01-27T10:48:00.000Z	Breakage	spdf	problem with that is it doesn't maximise or pause. I have audio sync problems with totem and vlc freezes sometimes like its buffering and doesn't start again. you know anyother divx players?
2008-01-27T10:48:00.000Z	spdf	Breakage	try xine or vl
2008-01-27T10:48:00.000Z	spdf	Breakage	vlc, rather
2008-01-27T10:48:00.000Z	Breakage	spdf	thanks ill try xine :) if this doesnt work
