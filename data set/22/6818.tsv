2006-09-30T11:08:00.000Z	cpk1		maybe I am having a problem mounting the .iso because i created it from a .mdf?
2006-09-30T11:10:00.000Z	jtholmes	cpk1	sorry what is an  .mdf
2006-09-30T11:10:00.000Z	cpk1		some thing that windows can mount like an image
2006-09-30T11:11:00.000Z	jtholmes	cpk1	ok, i assumed that, is it a linux/unix type
2006-09-30T11:12:00.000Z	cpk1		dont think so, i got mdf2iso to make it an iso, i read some forum post saying that you couldnt mount .mdf or .mds
2006-09-30T11:12:00.000Z	jtholmes	cpk1	 run file  *.iso and see what it tells you
2006-09-30T11:13:00.000Z	cpk1		err how do you run an iso?
2006-09-30T11:15:00.000Z	cpk1		mount -o loop -t iso9660 /path/to/foo.iso /mnt gives me "mount: not a directory"
2006-09-30T11:15:00.000Z	jtholmes	cpk1	 just  execute   'file  *iso'  and see what  the file command tells you the file type is
2006-09-30T11:15:00.000Z	jtholmes	cpk1	 *iso is you iso file name
2006-09-30T11:16:00.000Z	cpk1		it says iso 9660
2006-09-30T11:17:00.000Z	jtholmes	cpk1	 then  try   mount  -o loop -t iso9660  *isofile  /mnt    and see what it does
2006-09-30T11:18:00.000Z	cpk1	jtholmes	gives me "mount: not a directory"
2006-09-30T11:18:00.000Z	jtholmes	cpk1	 of course  *isofile  is   /path/path2/isofile
2006-09-30T11:18:00.000Z	cpk1		yup
2006-09-30T11:19:00.000Z	jtholmes	cpk1	interesting  give me a minute let me look at my notes
2006-09-30T11:19:00.000Z	jtholmes	cpk1	 i am  running  6.10 live on top of my  suse and have to mount some slices
2006-09-30T11:21:00.000Z	cpk1	jtholmes	i think i might have found something, it is trying to loop with /dev/loop0 which i dont have, should I go ahead and make it?
2006-09-30T11:21:00.000Z	cpk1		what does losetup do?
2006-09-30T11:23:00.000Z	jtholmes	cpk1	setup, deletes, lists, creates you loop devices
2006-09-30T11:23:00.000Z	jtholmes	cpk1	 please send me the command you used to mount
2006-09-30T11:24:00.000Z	jtholmes	cpk1	because what I sent you should work
