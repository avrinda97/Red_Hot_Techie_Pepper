2007-01-11T13:55:00.000Z	tux		hi uboto
2007-01-11T13:57:00.000Z	un_operateur	tux	why are you looking to do that anyway? :)
2007-01-11T13:58:00.000Z	tux	un_operateur	ive got to speed up firefox
2007-01-11T13:58:00.000Z	un_operateur	tux	errm, i think the solution to that is to use a leaner browser :)
2007-01-11T13:59:00.000Z	tux	un_operateur	is there anyting to suggest ive used dillo
2007-01-11T13:59:00.000Z	un_operateur	tux	you could try renicing firefox, but that wont make much of a difference -- firefox runs as fast as it can
2007-01-11T13:59:00.000Z	tux	un_operateur	yah dats right ive tried it
2007-01-11T14:00:00.000Z	un_operateur	tux	personally, i dont require a fast browser and can't do without the firefox extensions so i stick with firefox -- if i needed a ddecent browser otherwise, i'd choose opera
2007-01-11T14:00:00.000Z	tux	un_operateur	but is it in ubuntu repository?
2007-01-11T14:01:00.000Z	un_operateur	tux	galeon worked nicely while i had it -- but it lacked certain support for the firefox entensions
2007-01-11T14:01:00.000Z	un_operateur	tux	it's in the ubuntu commercial repository -- and opera also has an ubuntu repository (google)
2007-01-11T14:01:00.000Z	tux	un_operateur	ok thank you
2007-01-11T14:03:00.000Z	tux	un_operateur	but is galeon similiar to dillo ? or it is better?
2007-01-11T14:03:00.000Z	un_operateur	tux	errm, i've not tried dillo - so i can't say
2007-01-11T14:04:00.000Z	tux	un_operateur	its very light weight... thank you
2007-01-11T14:05:00.000Z	un_operateur	tux	well, anything apart from firefox feels lightweight -- but they then lack the support and robustness of firefox -- but what you are doing is good, i.e. experimenting
2007-01-11T14:22:00.000Z	un_operateur	tux	normally, mixing sources.list is not recommended .. you should either enable the ubuntu repos and disable the xubuntu ones or vice-versa
