2010-03-01T20:57:00.000Z	|MA|		I've had a logitech keyboard
2010-03-01T20:57:00.000Z	|MA|		yeah, I was using wireless. In fact the wireless keyboard/mouse stuff is transparent. No issues under Linux
2010-03-01T20:58:00.000Z	|MA|		It even works at a BIOS level
2010-03-01T20:58:00.000Z	|MA|		I've used it through grub and well, almost everything was fine
2010-03-01T20:58:00.000Z	|MA|		but well, I've had bad experiences with wireless keyboards, whichever OS it was
2010-03-01T20:59:00.000Z	|MA|		sometimes, it forgets the pairing
2010-03-01T20:59:00.000Z	|MA|		but that has nothing to do with Linux at all
2010-03-01T20:59:00.000Z	|MA|		It happens under all OS's
2010-03-01T21:00:00.000Z	|MA|		anyone has any idea on the acrobat reader , problem that i mentioned ?
2010-03-01T21:01:00.000Z	|MA|		I did a strace http://paste.ubuntu.com/386334/ but don't really follow what's happening ... ANy ideas, please ?
2010-03-01T21:01:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	|MA|	What are the symptom?
2010-03-01T21:01:00.000Z	|MA|	KB1JWQ	it looks thus: http://paste.ubuntu.com/386190/
2010-03-01T21:02:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	|MA|	"file /opt/Adobe/Reader9/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread"
2010-03-01T21:03:00.000Z	|MA|	KB1JWQ	this is what it says: http://paste.ubuntu.com/386380/
2010-03-01T21:04:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	|MA|	So, what does "file" say about that? :-)
2010-03-01T21:04:00.000Z	|MA|	KB1JWQ	i pasted that URL, no ?
2010-03-01T21:05:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	|MA|	A syntax error on a binary?  Something's broken.
2010-03-01T21:05:00.000Z	|MA|	KB1JWQ	anyidea what that would be ?
2010-03-01T21:06:00.000Z	|MA|	KB1JWQ	 since i installed it from one of the repositories, it cannot be that the binary is b)rked ...
2010-03-01T21:06:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	|MA|	I'll agree it's unlikely, but nothing's impossible.
2010-03-01T21:06:00.000Z	|MA|	KB1JWQ	or could it be that way ?
2010-03-01T21:07:00.000Z	|MA|	KB1JWQ	I have been pulling my hair out for the past 2 days and hence my question ..
