2008-08-22T11:49:00.000Z	Scorp_		Hey, my amarok is hanging the moment i Play a song. What could be the reason ???
2008-08-22T11:49:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Scorp_	getting any error messages?
2008-08-22T11:50:00.000Z	Scorp_	zhaozhou	No, just a blank small window on the top left of the screen and later it says force quit.. I have the codecs and have been using it till yesterday.. and also, the drive is mounted
2008-08-22T11:51:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Scorp_	WHat you could do, but that could be a bit advanced, is to strace it.
2008-08-22T11:52:00.000Z	Scorp_	zhaozhou	Umm, and that means ???
2008-08-22T11:52:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Scorp_	Can try whatever the others are saying first, see if you find a better solution. :-)
2008-08-22T11:53:00.000Z	Scorp_	zhaozhou	i think i'll try restarting the X first.. that solves most of the probs...
2008-08-22T11:54:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Scorp_	I doubt it.
2008-08-22T11:54:00.000Z	Scorp_	zhaozhou	I clicked the icon and the system monitor shows more than 25 processes of amarok, each around 1.1 MB
2008-08-22T11:55:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Scorp_	The reason it's hanging is most probably when it's opening a file, whether it's the audiodriver, the song or perhaps any library.
2008-08-22T11:55:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Scorp_	Oh wow, you could kill those.
2008-08-22T11:55:00.000Z	Scorp_	zhaozhou	there are 4 amarok and many more amarokapp!!
2008-08-22T11:55:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Scorp_	Kill every single one, then start amarok again.
2008-08-22T11:56:00.000Z	Scorp_	zhaozhou	When i kill the last 2-3 processes they come back again.. Why is that ??
2008-08-22T11:56:00.000Z	Scorp_	zhaozhou	and the number is increasing automatically !! :(
2008-08-22T11:57:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Scorp_	Since i don't run amarok i can't check this, but as you may know every process have a 'mother' checking out for them. That process is starting them. But - you could do a 'killall amarok' and 'killall amarokapp'
2008-08-22T11:58:00.000Z	Scorp_	zhaozhou	thanks.. that helped..
2008-08-22T12:00:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Scorp_	So, it works now?
2008-08-22T12:00:00.000Z	Scorp_	zhaozhou	yepp!! prob was with pulseaudio !
2008-08-22T12:00:00.000Z	Scorp_	zhaozhou	those multiple instances were opening trying to open the sound driver..!!
2008-08-22T12:01:00.000Z	zhaozhou	Scorp_	Haha. Well, you know what to do if the problem comes again.
2008-08-22T12:01:00.000Z	Scorp_	zhaozhou	sure i do..
