2008-05-31T10:58:00.000Z	AdemoS	troxor	you win :P
2008-05-31T10:58:00.000Z	troxor	AdemoS	gg ;)
2008-05-31T10:59:00.000Z	AdemoS	troxor	any idea about my question?
2008-05-31T10:59:00.000Z	troxor	AdemoS	I believe you can use older kernels with no (or very few problems)
2008-05-31T11:00:00.000Z	AdemoS	troxor	what problems (if any) do you think I should I be aware of?
2008-05-31T11:01:00.000Z	troxor	AdemoS	some things that compile against kernel headers, such as restricted-drivers, and their kin, might be a little off
2008-05-31T11:01:00.000Z	troxor	AdemoS	though I'm not sure- it's worth a try, since you can have multiple kernel versions installed simultaneously
2008-05-31T11:02:00.000Z	troxor	AdemoS	glibc might whine too, though I'm not entirely sure- it's one of those 'try it and see' type situations :\
2008-05-31T11:02:00.000Z	AdemoS	troxor	hmm, I was hoping for stability + new software combatibility, seems like both may be at risk with my idea :C
2008-05-31T11:04:00.000Z	troxor	AdemoS	you might also looking into backporting or recompiling an older kernel, though that too might be more trouble than it's worth
2008-05-31T11:04:00.000Z	AdemoS	troxor	nods. I may just enable hardy repos, but I was worried about dependencies :x
2008-05-31T11:04:00.000Z	troxor	AdemoS	kernel shouldn't have many of those ;)
2008-05-31T11:05:00.000Z	AdemoS	troxor	I guess if I was stability, I have to wait for Ibex? Or do you think Ubuntu devs will ever figure out a patch to all the random freezing present in Hardy? Cause it's so frusturating to go from rock-solid gutsy to unpredictable-hardy....ironicly the LTS release
2008-05-31T11:07:00.000Z	troxor	AdemoS	yeah, hardy will be given attention longer than gutsy will, so you might have better luck
2008-05-31T11:07:00.000Z	troxor	AdemoS	er, better luck staying with gutsy until support runs out
2008-05-31T11:07:00.000Z	AdemoS	troxor	yeah I guess I will. It's just a damn shame, I'm always advertising Ubuntu's stability to friends...then I get hardy and *boom!* I guess I'll have to wait it out
2008-05-31T11:16:00.000Z	AdemoS	troxor	so where can I keep an eye on, to see when Gutsy has become more stable?
2008-05-31T11:16:00.000Z	AdemoS	troxor	*hardy
2008-05-31T11:16:00.000Z	troxor	AdemoS	subscribing to the relevant bug reports in launchpad would be your best bet, imho
2008-05-31T11:17:00.000Z	AdemoS	troxor	that could be true, though most of the bug reports are close but not quite my issue, but bug reports in general are a good place to get an idea, thanks a lot
2008-05-31T11:17:00.000Z	troxor	AdemoS	no problemo- be glad that the ubuntu bug community is active and very good ;)
2008-05-31T11:17:00.000Z	AdemoS	troxor	heh indeed
