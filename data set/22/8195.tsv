2006-06-20T16:18:00.000Z	arnold		Hello how can I unmount a diviser??
2006-06-20T16:18:00.000Z	ccooke	arnold	what's a diviser?
2006-06-20T16:18:00.000Z	arnold		a partition?
2006-06-20T16:19:00.000Z	ccooke	arnold	ah, right. How did you mount it?
2006-06-20T16:19:00.000Z	arnold		it mounted itself
2006-06-20T16:19:00.000Z	ccooke	arnold	how? Is it a usb disk or external device?
2006-06-20T16:19:00.000Z	arnold		it is vfat...
2006-06-20T16:20:00.000Z	ccooke	arnold	do you know what device it is?
2006-06-20T16:20:00.000Z	arnold		and not external...
2006-06-20T16:20:00.000Z	arnold		yes
2006-06-20T16:20:00.000Z	arnold		hda1
2006-06-20T16:21:00.000Z	ccooke	arnold	Right. You need to remove the line in /etc/fstab that refers to it. But you need to be *very* careful to make sure you only change that line.
2006-06-20T16:21:00.000Z	arnold		ok fine
2006-06-20T16:21:00.000Z	ccooke	arnold	use 'sudo gedit /etc/fstab' to edit the file
2006-06-20T16:21:00.000Z	arnold		I did it...
2006-06-20T16:21:00.000Z	ccooke	arnold	Also, make sure it says 'vfat' on the line before you remove it.
2006-06-20T16:21:00.000Z	arnold		it did say so
2006-06-20T16:22:00.000Z	arnold	ccooke	it did
2006-06-20T16:22:00.000Z	ccooke	arnold	right. now, that'll take care of the next boot. To unmount it this boot, make sure every folder you have open on that partition is closed, any files on the partition are closed and type 'sudo umount /dev/hda1'
2006-06-20T16:23:00.000Z	arnold		what should I do then?
2006-06-20T16:23:00.000Z	arnold		ok great thanks very much
2006-06-20T16:24:00.000Z	ccooke	arnold	no problem.
