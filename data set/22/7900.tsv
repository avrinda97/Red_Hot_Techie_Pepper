2005-11-27T13:17:00.000Z	aftertaf	xxvii	 if with apt, then sudo apt-get remove azureus will do
2005-11-27T13:17:00.000Z	xxvii	aftertaf	if i remember correctly, it was a tar file, i think.. so i didnt really install it
2005-11-27T13:18:00.000Z	aftertaf	xxvii	 you got the tarball and tar xvzf 'ed it? then make make install ,
2005-11-27T13:24:00.000Z	aftertaf	xxvii	 if you can use apt, that is always best, what are you d:l ing?
2005-11-27T13:24:00.000Z	xxvii	aftertaf	limewire.. the only options are .rpm and .zip unfortunately
2005-11-27T13:25:00.000Z	xxvii	aftertaf	p2p networking
2005-11-27T13:25:00.000Z	aftertaf	xxvii	 and better to use tarballs, rpms arent packaged for debian systems.
