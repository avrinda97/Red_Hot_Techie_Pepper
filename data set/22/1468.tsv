2011-01-11T19:48:00.000Z	Roasted_		where can I file bugs with nautilus or gnome or whatever? I think there's been a bug in existence for, oh, I don't know, the last 6 years... I'd like to bring it to attention. again. but I forget where to post.
2011-01-11T19:49:00.000Z	acicula_	Roasted_	depends either on launchpad or directly with the gnome developers themselves(they have their own bug system)
2011-01-11T19:49:00.000Z	Roasted_	acicula_	thanks. Have you noticed that "apply permissions to enclosed files" do.. uh... nothing?
2011-01-11T19:49:00.000Z	acicula_	Roasted_	i have not
2011-01-11T19:50:00.000Z	Roasted_	acicula_	gets a little old. I'm a terminal junkie, but really? It's a bit of a headache when grandma moves files to/from an external drive and permissions are out of wack and I need to remote in to issue a chmod -R command.
2011-01-11T19:53:00.000Z	acicula_	Roasted_	its annoying if it doesnt do what it says on the box. Did you check the sub files are all owned by the same user?
2011-01-11T19:54:00.000Z	Roasted_	acicula_	that's where the issue is. The files came through as root:root on the external, but if you take ownership of the root folder, you SHOULD be able to take owner ship of the sub files/folders inside. Dolphin does this just fine.
2011-01-11T19:56:00.000Z	Roasted_	acicula_	it basically will transfer perms, but not ownership/group, which is kind of a royal PITA that there's no other way to do it than terminal. Again, I have no issue with it, but grandma does. Grandma would rather buy a windows license at the moment...
2011-01-11T19:57:00.000Z	acicula_	Roasted_	well not recursively disowning root is a good thing i suppose, but cant you access the external disk as a user and avoid having the files owned by root in the first plaec?
2011-01-11T19:57:00.000Z	Roasted_	acicula_	typically yeah - but when I take a folder that is owned by root with files in it, it comes down as owned by ME since I'm writing that folder to my home directory. But the files inside remain as root... hence the issue.
2011-01-11T19:57:00.000Z	acicula_	Roasted_	also how is she moving files as a user which are subsequently owned by root?
2011-01-11T19:58:00.000Z	Roasted_	acicula_	yeah.
2011-01-11T19:59:00.000Z	acicula_	Roasted_	you cant copy files and have copies owned by root, unless you are root
2011-01-11T19:59:00.000Z	Roasted_	acicula_	either way if you're in nautilus as root, you should be able to handle this task. Dolphin can do it without an issue.
2011-01-11T19:59:00.000Z	Roasted_	acicula_	that's another thing I may have forgotten to mention, about using gksudo nautilus.
2011-01-11T19:59:00.000Z	Roasted_	acicula_	gksudo nautilus.
2011-01-11T20:00:00.000Z	acicula_	Roasted_	running nautiuls as root may well cause half the problems you are having
2011-01-11T20:01:00.000Z	Roasted_	acicula_	point is, nautilus as root DOES NOT work in the same demeanor that dolphin does.
2011-01-11T20:01:00.000Z	acicula_	Roasted_	well i dont know how nautiuls behaves when ran as root
2011-01-11T20:02:00.000Z	acicula_	Roasted_	running it as root is sheer madness though
2011-01-11T20:15:00.000Z	Roasted_	acicula_	look what I found - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1454684
2011-01-11T20:15:00.000Z	Roasted_	acicula_	two awesome work arounds that I just tested. both work. :)
