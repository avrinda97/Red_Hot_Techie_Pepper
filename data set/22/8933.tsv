2005-04-28T11:06:00.000Z	Poprocks		hey all, I just installed Warty yesterday and apt-got it to Hoary.  It was working fine at first, but now when GNOME starts, my laptop freezes solid -- it gets to putting the gnome-panel but before the applets can load it freezes
2005-04-28T11:07:00.000Z	djm62	Poprocks	can you start it from the command line to see what errors come up?
2005-04-28T11:07:00.000Z	Poprocks	djm62	I don't get any
2005-04-28T11:08:00.000Z	djm62	Poprocks	does it completely freeze, or does gnome just stop loading?
2005-04-28T11:08:00.000Z	Poprocks	djm62	I can't move the mouse, and I can't ctrl+alt+backspace
2005-04-28T11:09:00.000Z	djm62	Poprocks	nasty! but X is starting ok, because you see the pictures until then?
2005-04-28T11:09:00.000Z	Poprocks	djm62	yeah I can start X with an xterm
2005-04-28T11:14:00.000Z	djm62	Poprocks	can you ssh to the machine? to confirm how deeply it's locked
2005-04-28T11:14:00.000Z	Poprocks	djm62	good question, I'll try
2005-04-28T11:21:00.000Z	djm62	Poprocks	can you specify noacpi on booting?
2005-04-28T11:21:00.000Z	djm62	Poprocks	but it would be nice to know if that was the problem
2005-04-28T11:21:00.000Z	djm62	Poprocks	then solve it if it is
2005-04-28T11:21:00.000Z	Poprocks	djm62	why would starting gnome-panel not crash it then?
2005-04-28T11:22:00.000Z	djm62	Poprocks	the whole thing seems weird to me...the only thing I can thing of is the HAL
2005-04-28T11:22:00.000Z	Poprocks	djm62	I'll get rid of hal & dbus from my runlevel
2005-04-28T11:25:00.000Z	djm62	Poprocks	also, did the upgrade go completely right? did you use dist-upgrade? are all warty type entries definitely gone from your file
2005-04-28T11:26:00.000Z	Poprocks	djm62	that I'm not sure about
2005-04-28T11:26:00.000Z	Poprocks	djm62	and if by "my file" you mean sources.list then yes
2005-04-28T11:30:00.000Z	djm62	Poprocks	I'm completely stumped...when you say running gnome-panel doesn't crash it...does that mean all you applets are loaded and working?
2005-04-28T11:30:00.000Z	Poprocks	djm62	correct
2005-04-28T11:32:00.000Z	djm62	Poprocks	what if you create a new user...does starting from default settings make a difference?
2005-04-28T11:34:00.000Z	Poprocks	djm62	I'll try that now
