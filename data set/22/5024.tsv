2007-08-19T12:11:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny		Okay, I screwed up my install, bad I think. I can't seem to burn a good cdr so I did a netboot install. I have no GUI, and no idea how to get it. Hints?
2007-08-19T12:12:00.000Z	Flannel	Rabbitbunny	Alright, well, first thing, do you get a prompt, and can you login?
2007-08-19T12:12:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	Flannel	yes. I'm quite sure this part is okay, man, sudo and shutdown work.
2007-08-19T12:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Rabbitbunny	alright, you were installing Ubuntu? or kubuntu or what?  We'll just see if our install of that goes without a hitch
2007-08-19T12:13:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	Flannel	Ubuntu desktop
2007-08-19T12:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Rabbitbunny	alright, so, `sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop`
2007-08-19T12:14:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	Flannel	Oh. that would install gnome.
2007-08-19T12:16:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	Flannel	the screen quit scrolling and I'm back to a prmpt. How to start gnome?
2007-08-19T12:18:00.000Z	Flannel	Rabbitbunny	try ctrl-alt-f7 to get to GDM, if not, make sure gdm is running, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
2007-08-19T12:18:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	Flannel	thank you
2007-08-20T12:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Rabbitbunny	you should have just asked.  And, on top of that, it started automatically after you installed it.
2007-08-20T12:50:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	Flannel	I guess I'm a glutton. a LAMP stack should have been cake work for me.
2007-08-20T12:51:00.000Z	Flannel	Rabbitbunny	there's a howto about it.  Did you find that?  Are you already all setup?
2007-08-20T12:51:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	Flannel	Yes just found it.

2008-06-23T00:42:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	Flannel	I'm playing with tunneling X via ssh, tunneling xterm feels kinda dumb.
2008-06-23T00:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Rabbitbunny	6.10 is EOL, you really ought to upgrade, by the way.
2008-06-23T00:43:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	Flannel	Yeah, I just went through it on my desktop, Kinda antsy about doing the server. Thanks for reminding me.
2009-04-01T04:16:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	Flannel	Thank You.
