2007-05-03T12:56:00.000Z	neverblue		can you make apache2.conf available as well (temporarily)?
2007-05-03T12:57:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	you need to purge apache2-common (or apache2.2-common) then reinstall, the "apache2" package won't do that
2007-05-03T12:57:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	and, httpd.conf is empty.  Ubuntu (and debian systems) don't use it.  Instead they use a mixture of apache2.conf, and the stuff in sites-enabled, and hte stuff in mods-enabled.
2007-05-03T12:57:00.000Z	neverblue	Flannel	whats the command exactly?
2007-05-03T12:58:00.000Z	neverblue	Flannel	right, im finding that out
2007-05-03T12:58:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	you on feisty? or dapper/edgy?
2007-05-03T12:58:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	sudo apt-get remove --purge apache2.2-common
2007-05-03T12:59:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	thn install apache2 (sudo apt-get install apache2)
2007-05-03T13:00:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	Oh, synaptic will work too.  In synaptic, find apache2.2-common, then click it and mark it for "complete removal"
2007-05-03T13:00:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	then reinstall apache2 (complete-removal is equivalent to --purge)
2007-05-03T13:01:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	purging apache2 won't do it, since the "apache2" package doesn't install the config stuff, apache2.2-common does
2007-05-03T14:49:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	purge apache2, apache2.2-common, apache2-utils, apache2-mpm-worker.. and I think that'd be it.  There'll be a few other packages (APR runtimes and stuff), but I dont know if other things depend on those or not
2007-05-03T14:49:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	but, those four will remove 90% of apache2, and all of the functionality.
2007-05-03T14:51:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	the other few files would be libapr1 and libaprutil1,  mark those for removal, and see if you're removing anything else (that looks like it's not apache related), if so... don't remove them (other stuff might use the APR, I dont know)
2007-05-03T14:51:00.000Z	neverblue	Flannel	can i take you to pm for a min instead?
2007-05-03T14:51:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	sure
2007-07-20T12:38:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	the... relative path?  relative to what?
2007-07-20T12:39:00.000Z	neverblue	Flannel	atm I have [me@server dir] 
2007-07-20T12:39:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	right, what are you looking to get?
2007-07-20T12:40:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	ah, you misunderstand.  It is.  it's not dir, it's ~/dir
2007-07-20T12:41:00.000Z	neverblue	Flannel	i misunderstood?
2008-03-24T20:53:00.000Z	Flannel	neverblue	no, German. I just can't type properly.  dutch is nl anyway
