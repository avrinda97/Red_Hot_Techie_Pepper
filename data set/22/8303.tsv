2007-03-10T10:12:00.000Z	Flannel	jusama15	I'd check launchpad, actually.  Since it could be a bug
2007-03-10T10:44:00.000Z	Flannel	jusama15	ndiswrapper is in the repositories (and as such, a nice package)
2007-03-10T10:48:00.000Z	Flannel	jusama15	Install the ndiswrapper from the repositories, it's a hundred times easier.
2007-03-10T10:49:00.000Z	Flannel	jusama15	You have the Ubuntu CD, right?
2007-03-10T10:49:00.000Z	Flannel	jusama15	ndiswrapper is on that.  You need to use apt-cdrom to add the CD as a repository, and then you can grab it
2007-03-10T10:50:00.000Z	Flannel	jusama15	"sudo apt-cdrom add"
2007-03-10T10:51:00.000Z	Flannel	jusama15	then "sudo apt-get update", then sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper... uh, I don't know  ok, so, "sudo apt-cache search ndiswrapper", and then install whatever you need
2007-03-10T10:51:00.000Z	Flannel	jusama15	cd Deskop
2007-03-10T10:53:00.000Z	Flannel	jusama15	which package?
2007-03-10T10:55:00.000Z	Flannel	jusama15	"ndiswrapper" isn't a package, there's ndiswrapper-common, and ndiswrapper-utils (and some others), I'm not sure what you need
2007-03-10T11:01:00.000Z	Flannel	jusama15	well, that page has more information than I know ;)
2007-03-10T11:03:00.000Z	Flannel	jusama15	I have never used ndiswrapper, and have no idea how it works, so no.  I really can't explain better.
