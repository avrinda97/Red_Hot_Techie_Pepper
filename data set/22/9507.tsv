2005-05-18T13:57:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	hi kratz
2005-05-18T13:57:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	Is mounting your windows partition all you need help with? (or do you have some other problems)
2005-05-18T13:58:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	ok, lets start at the begging, whats the most important problem you have?
2005-05-18T13:59:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	ok, so we'll solve those two things
2005-05-18T13:59:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	What are you trying to compile with "make"
2005-05-18T14:01:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	ping
2005-05-18T14:01:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	sorry just read
2005-05-18T14:01:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	ok, if you want to install programs in ubuntu
2005-05-18T14:01:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	you shoudl first go system->administration->synaptic package manager
2005-05-18T14:02:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	This lets you install ubuntu packages, that will work much better than if you compile them yourself
2005-05-18T14:03:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	if you want to browse other computers o the network
2005-05-18T14:03:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	You can choose places->network, wait a bit and they should appear (You may also have to look under windows servers)
2005-05-18T14:04:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	ok so you do a search for wine
2005-05-18T14:04:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	then you can click on the little icon and hit mark for installation
2005-05-18T14:04:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	and then press apply on the toolbar, and it will intsall it
2005-05-18T14:04:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	have you waited? (it takes a minute to come up)
2005-05-18T14:04:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	installing the samba package might help (but it shoudl work)
2005-05-18T14:04:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	right, you ahve to use wine from the command line
2005-05-18T14:05:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	cd into the directory with the windows program you want
2005-05-18T14:05:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	and run "wine program.exe"
2005-05-18T14:05:00.000Z	Lathiat	kratz	be aware that unfortunately, wine doesnt run everything
