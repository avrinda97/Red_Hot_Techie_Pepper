2006-12-05T13:39:00.000Z	UbuntuCE		hi. who knows openoffice writer well?
2006-12-05T13:40:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuCE	is this a survey or a help request?
2006-12-05T13:40:00.000Z	UbuntuCE	soundray	i have trouble with pages numering- i have 2-9 ok, but over them it`s still 1,1,1 etc.
2006-12-05T13:41:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuCE	can you rephrase that?
2006-12-05T13:41:00.000Z	UbuntuCE	soundray	i write in writer
2006-12-05T13:42:00.000Z	UbuntuCE	soundray	and number the pages
2006-12-05T13:42:00.000Z	UbuntuCE	soundray	2 to 9 are ok (2,3,4 etc.), but over 10 page all pages are named "1"
2006-12-05T13:43:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuCE	it's a space issue. Your page number is partly covered up.
2006-12-05T13:43:00.000Z	UbuntuCE	soundray	how to correct it?
2006-12-05T13:44:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuCE	depends on your layout. Try putting your page number in a footer or header and center it with Ctrl-E
2006-12-05T13:45:00.000Z	UbuntuCE	soundray	 now all pages are "9"
2006-12-05T13:46:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuCE	have you placed your page numbers in a footer?
2006-12-05T13:47:00.000Z	UbuntuCE	soundray	 fotter is the bar on the down? yes, i checked the wrong number and typed "9"
2006-12-05T13:49:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuCE	remove the 9 and do an Insert-Fields-Page Number
2006-12-05T13:51:00.000Z	UbuntuCE	soundray	 i dit. but the situations is identitcal to the beggining
2006-12-05T13:55:00.000Z	UbuntuCE	soundray	any ideas why there is no 10,11, but 1,1,1 ?
2006-12-05T13:55:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuCE	I told you, didn't you listen?
2006-12-05T13:56:00.000Z	UbuntuCE	soundray	 it doesn`t work
2006-12-05T13:56:00.000Z	UbuntuCE	soundray	 it`s still 1,1,1 instead of 10,11 etc.
2006-12-05T13:56:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuCE	you have to give it enough space
2006-12-05T13:56:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuCE	the page numbers are there, but they are covered up. You might try reducing the font size to prove the point
2006-12-05T13:57:00.000Z	UbuntuCE	soundray	sorry for my poor english. you solution works. thank you
