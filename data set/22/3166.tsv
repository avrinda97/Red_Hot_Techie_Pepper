2009-01-05T16:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ardaking	do some websearching about xorg.conf, you will see tonnes of guides and help
2009-01-05T16:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ardaking	im not overly sure how to do it but you setup displays in there so its probably the best place to start imho

2009-01-05T17:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ardaking	let me search
2009-01-05T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ardaking	where you have your res for example "1024x768"
2009-01-05T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ardaking	try "1024x768-75.0"
2009-01-05T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ardaking	looks like the deal in some forums
2009-01-05T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ardaking	put that for the mode you wanna use then save, close gedit then hit ctrl+alt+backspace (save all work first)

2009-01-05T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ardaking	you'll need some lines about screen modes for resolution, you can then specify refresh. find some example xorg.confs. you backed your old xorg.conf up earlier so you can play all you wish
