2012-10-20T16:44:00.000Z	aravind_		but the dash does not slide when i move the mouse to the left side of the screen
2012-10-20T16:46:00.000Z	Stanley00	aravind_	how about the Top Corner?
2012-10-20T16:46:00.000Z	aravind_	Stanley00	no, top corner also not working
2012-10-20T16:47:00.000Z	Stanley00	aravind_	hmm, you mean the launcher, right? does the top panel show up?
2012-10-20T16:47:00.000Z	Stanley00	aravind_	and does super work?
2012-10-20T16:47:00.000Z	Stanley00		*super key*
2012-10-20T16:48:00.000Z	aravind_	Stanley00	super?
2012-10-20T16:48:00.000Z	aravind_	Stanley00	yes
2012-10-20T16:49:00.000Z	Stanley00	aravind_	try move your mouse fast and hard to the left. May be it needs some pushing
2012-10-20T16:49:00.000Z	aravind_	Stanley00	no its not working
2012-10-20T16:52:00.000Z	Stanley00	aravind_	that's strange, you're using the default unity, right? I mean you don't use a customized unity?
2012-10-20T16:52:00.000Z	aravind_	Stanley00	yes
2012-10-20T16:53:00.000Z	Stanley00	aravind_	may be you should try reset unity via dconf, don't use the "unity --reset"
2012-10-20T16:54:00.000Z	aravind_	Stanley00	ok, i'm in dconf now, plz guide to reset unity
2012-10-20T16:55:00.000Z	Stanley00	aravind_	run this in Terminal, and then restart, hope this works "dconf reset -f /org/compiz/"
2012-10-20T16:56:00.000Z	aravind_	Stanley00	the edge-responsiveness value is 8.0. should i lower it
2012-10-20T16:57:00.000Z	Stanley00	aravind_	I don't know, I adjust that via Appearance
2012-10-20T16:58:00.000Z	aravind_	Stanley00	i tried the command which you have suggested but it doesnt work
2012-10-20T16:59:00.000Z	Stanley00	aravind_	did you reboot Ubuntu?
2012-10-20T16:59:00.000Z	aravind_	Stanley00	no
2012-10-20T16:59:00.000Z	Stanley00	aravind_	I think it need restart to take effect
