2010-06-01T18:31:00.000Z	hhuti	nickaugust	 Did you enable the drivers?
2010-06-01T18:31:00.000Z	nickaugust	hhuti	mine was working last week though...
2010-06-01T18:31:00.000Z	hhuti	nickaugust	 x86 or amd 64 version....what are you using?
2010-06-01T18:32:00.000Z	nickaugust	hhuti	im using x86... does wlan0 show up in your ifconfig?
2010-06-01T18:33:00.000Z	hhuti	nickaugust	 no...
2010-06-01T18:34:00.000Z	hhuti	nickaugust	 and in network manager do you have wireless with gray and it shows disconnected?
2010-06-01T18:35:00.000Z	nickaugust	hhuti	i have some networks in that network manager but i dont think that means anything.  it sounds like your card isnt being reconginzed

2010-06-01T18:37:00.000Z	hhuti	nickaugust	 under wireless networks when i click the icon in my toolbar it just says 'disconnected-so you have the same problem as I have
2010-06-01T18:39:00.000Z	nickaugust	hhuti	do the 'sudo lshw' and see if you can see your wirless card in there
2010-06-01T18:40:00.000Z	nickaugust	hhuti	try 'sudo lshw | grep wireless' or if that doesnt work just 'sudo lshw' and see if you see it in there
2010-06-01T18:40:00.000Z	hhuti	nickaugust	 look at this http://pastie.org/987270 I'm a beginner... is my wifi working?
2010-06-01T18:41:00.000Z	nickaugust	hhuti	try the lshw stuff above and paste the results
2010-06-01T18:41:00.000Z	hhuti	nickaugust	 http://pastie.org/987276
2010-06-01T18:42:00.000Z	hhuti	nickaugust	 I think it is working, isn't it?
2010-06-01T18:43:00.000Z	nickaugust	hhuti	paste the whole lshw without the grep
2010-06-01T18:43:00.000Z	nickaugust	hhuti	sorry grep was a dumb idea :/
2010-06-01T18:44:00.000Z	hhuti	nickaugust	 http://pastie.org/987279
2010-06-01T18:46:00.000Z	hhuti	nickaugust	 I posted, if there's something else please tell me. I really want to make wireless work.
2010-06-01T18:49:00.000Z	nickaugust	hhuti	looks like your card is recognized... i'm not sure where to go from there.  type a short summary of your problem including the pastie.org links of ifconfig and lshw and maybe somone else can help
