2006-03-13T06:37:00.000Z	bimberi	resista	how about this (a guess) - 'sudo update-alternatives --config gcc'  ?
2006-03-13T06:38:00.000Z	bimberi	resista	i think it says its broken because of an unsuccessful attempt to remove it
2006-03-13T06:45:00.000Z	resista	bimberi	yes, and it lists 200 packages

2006-03-13T06:58:00.000Z	resista	bimberi	Is it possible to do a force dist upgrade or something?
