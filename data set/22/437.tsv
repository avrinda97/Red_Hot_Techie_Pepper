2011-10-03T23:23:00.000Z	welshy_rob_	soreau	these are the results http://pastebin.com/c2naXCBF
2011-10-03T23:27:00.000Z	soreau	welshy_rob_	Are you sure the network cable is pugged securely?
2011-10-03T23:28:00.000Z	welshy_rob_	soreau	 yes, its plugged in okay, but this maybe a noobish thing to say but usually i get a orange and a green light appear, however since this problem has started ive only been getting a orange light very occasionally ??
2011-10-03T23:29:00.000Z	soreau	welshy_rob_	I believe the green light means it's plugged and orange means data is being transfered. If it's not connecting. there won't be much (if any) data transfering
2011-10-03T23:29:00.000Z	soreau		transferring*
2011-10-03T23:30:00.000Z	welshy_rob_	soreau	i see, so new network card then?
2011-10-03T23:30:00.000Z	soreau	welshy_rob_	It's not typical for a network card to just stop working though it's not inconceivable either
2011-10-03T23:31:00.000Z	welshy_rob_	soreau	btw, i just tried running a command i found on ubuntu forums "sudo ifup eth1" and it came back by saying ifup couldnt read interfaces file "etc/network/interfaces"
2011-10-03T23:31:00.000Z	soreau	welshy_rob_	If you have a live cd, try it and see if it works. If it does, the hardware is fine
2011-10-03T23:31:00.000Z	soreau	welshy_rob_	Well that could be a problem.. the file does exust, right?
2011-10-03T23:31:00.000Z	soreau		exist*
2011-10-03T23:32:00.000Z	welshy_rob_	soreau	apparently i can cd to it ?
2011-10-03T23:32:00.000Z	soreau	welshy_rob_	Just try 'cat /etc/network/interfaces'
2011-10-03T23:32:00.000Z	welshy_rob_	soreau	i would boot from a live cd but havent got a sata cable for my cd reader atm xD , will do
2011-10-03T23:34:00.000Z	welshy_rob_	soreau	it displayed the same as what was in the pastebin (auto eth1) etc
2011-10-03T23:34:00.000Z	soreau	welshy_rob_	Try 'gksi gedit /etc/network/interfaces' and comment out the line eth1 inet DCHP by putting a # at the beginning of the line
2011-10-03T23:34:00.000Z	soreau	welshy_rob_	not gksi, gksu
2011-10-03T23:34:00.000Z	welshy_rob_	soreau	kk
2011-10-03T23:35:00.000Z	welshy_rob_	soreau	okay, done that and saved it
2011-10-03T23:35:00.000Z	soreau	welshy_rob_	Now try sudo ifconfig eth0 up; sudo dhclient eth0
2011-10-03T23:36:00.000Z	welshy_rob_	soreau	brb
2011-10-03T23:37:00.000Z	soreau	welshy_rob_	gah, I mean not eth0 but eth1
