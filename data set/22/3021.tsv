2009-01-04T22:08:00.000Z	ameed		One more question , some friend recommnding me to use openSUSE 11 instead of Ubuntu does any one agree on that case?
2009-01-04T22:10:00.000Z	ameed		one more thing , is it possible to access the data on Windows while am in ubuntu ?
2009-01-04T22:10:00.000Z	ameed		even if both on the same HD
2009-01-04T22:10:00.000Z	ameed		where do i install that

2009-01-04T22:11:00.000Z	ameed		?
2009-01-04T22:11:00.000Z	the_squircle	ameed	Try mount /dev/sda1 (or whatever partition it is) /mnt
2009-01-04T22:05:00.000Z	the_squircle	ameed	boot to the LiveCD, use the partitioner to shrink Vista and add more room for Ubuntu
2009-01-04T22:06:00.000Z	the_squircle	ameed	nope
2009-01-04T22:07:00.000Z	the_squircle	ameed	I agree with DougEdith
2009-01-04T22:07:00.000Z	the_squircle	ameed	we love you too :p
2009-01-04T22:08:00.000Z	the_squircle	ameed	I used to use OpenSuSE 11... and I like Ubuntu much better... but OpenSuSE is much better from a corporate environment standpoint
2009-01-04T22:09:00.000Z	ameed	the_squircle	mean if planning to use it as a server correct
2009-01-04T22:10:00.000Z	the_squircle	ameed	I'd trust Ubuntu more as a server... but if you're in a business or have a large support group, I'd use OpenSuSE... if you want to have more fun with Linux (and better stability, better support) use Ubuntu
2009-01-04T22:10:00.000Z	the_squircle	ameed	Sure is! It should mount automagically
2009-01-04T22:10:00.000Z	the_squircle	ameed	yes
2009-01-04T22:10:00.000Z	the_squircle	ameed	it should be installed by default
2009-01-04T22:13:00.000Z	the_squircle	ameed	trial and error?
