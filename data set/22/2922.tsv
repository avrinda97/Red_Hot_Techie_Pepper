2009-02-16T12:19:00.000Z	tweak66	drash	how do i tell if my swap is mounted after reboot
2009-02-16T12:20:00.000Z	drash	tweak66	running "free -m" should report your swap space
2009-02-16T12:20:00.000Z	drash	tweak66	yw
2009-02-16T12:27:00.000Z	tweak66	drash	it's mounted properly thank you. only other question i have is when i created a blank ext3 partition there's a lost+found dir on it.. can i rm it?
2009-02-16T12:28:00.000Z	drash	tweak66	not sure you can, those are added to do recovery work i believe
2009-02-16T12:28:00.000Z	tweak66	drash	can it be hidden? or i'm stuck with it lol
2009-02-16T12:29:00.000Z	drash	tweak66	that might be one of those sticky ones :)
2009-02-16T12:29:00.000Z	tweak66	drash	hehe okay thank you very much, serriously. :)
2009-02-16T12:31:00.000Z	drash	tweak66	https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/8373 has the word on those lost+founds , very welcome
2009-02-16T12:39:00.000Z	drash	tweak66	how does your fstab look for that fresh partition ?
2009-02-16T12:39:00.000Z	tweak66	drash	: now that you mention it i never added it, that's the issue?
2009-02-16T12:41:00.000Z	drash	tweak66	might be, you can have it mounted manually if you like, much is possible :) .. but it's quite possible you mounted it read only right now
2009-02-16T12:44:00.000Z	tweak66	drash	i went to removable media under places to mount it?
2009-02-16T12:45:00.000Z	drash	tweak66	hang on for a second please
2009-02-16T12:46:00.000Z	tweak66	drash	no problem thank you
2009-02-16T12:53:00.000Z	drash	tweak66	still working on getting your drive issue fixed ? If so, could you provide a paste of your present /etc/fstab ? We can take it from there ...
2009-02-16T12:57:00.000Z	tweak66	drash	: http://pastebin.com/d475a31d6
2009-02-16T12:58:00.000Z	drash	tweak66	looking into it, reporting back in a few
2009-02-16T13:03:00.000Z	drash	tweak66	did you try adding "defaults" to your /line ? defaults,relatime,errors=remount-ro ... i believe that will make it rw
2009-02-16T13:05:00.000Z	tweak66	drash	then reboot?
2009-02-16T13:05:00.000Z	drash	tweak66	correct .. gotta go to work, goodluck
