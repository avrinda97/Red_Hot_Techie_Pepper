2010-03-01T18:01:00.000Z	archboxman		sysv-rc-conf and select to stop run process
2010-03-01T18:01:00.000Z	archboxman	abhi_nav_	this is dangerous and adviced.... want that to be clear
2010-03-01T18:02:00.000Z	archboxman	abhi_nav_	this is dangerous and not adviced.... want that to be clear
2010-03-01T18:02:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	archboxman	why it is dangerous?
2010-03-01T18:02:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	archboxman	wll i be able to enable it later on?
2010-03-01T18:02:00.000Z	archboxman	abhi_nav_	Wait till Lucid lynx the boot time is around 15 seconds or less
2010-03-01T18:03:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	archboxman	actually i dont want do disable it. i am planning to install kde and/or xfce. so after that kde will change my ubuntu splash screen to kubuntu. there i want to change it back to ubuntu.
2010-03-01T18:03:00.000Z	archboxman	abhi_nav_	palying around with sysv-rc-conf and you change the wrong item add the system wont boot... it is dangerous unless you read up on boot configuration
2010-03-01T18:04:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	archboxman	no i dont want to disable it. i want to change it. just read my above post
2010-03-01T18:04:00.000Z	abhi_nav_		please
2010-03-01T18:05:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	archboxman	or do you know a way by which i wll be able to install kde and/or xfce but keep splash screen of ubuntu only. the splash screen should not change to kubuntu or xubuntu
2010-03-01T18:05:00.000Z	archboxman	abhi_nav_	well you need to google changing kde splash screen and seek advise from a kde user... sorry love gnome and fluxbox... :)
2010-03-01T18:06:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	archboxman	i also like gnome. thats why i want to change kubuntu splash screen to ubuntu!!!
2010-03-01T18:06:00.000Z	archboxman	abhi_nav_	splash screen don't change... just add kubuntu or reinsall the system make sure to back up important files burn to dvd or cdrw
2010-03-01T18:07:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	archboxman	but what if i want to change splash screen? linux is about freedome naa?
2010-03-01T18:08:00.000Z	archboxman	abhi_nav_	No one here wants to berar of bad news so backup the important files first before you play with any of these ideas you have or you may take a trip down using livecd to recover the system...
2010-03-01T18:08:00.000Z	abhi_nav_		:)
2010-03-01T18:08:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	archboxman	ok sure thnx :) :) :)
