2005-04-25T09:53:00.000Z	frank	darGor	  sudo pppoeconf  should walk you through the whole confoguration  if you use  pppoe  which I think you do
2005-04-25T09:54:00.000Z	darGor	frank	i must get dns automatically. so, use some command of DHCP ?
2005-04-25T09:54:00.000Z	frank		For me it was done automatically
