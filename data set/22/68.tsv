2012-08-30T03:15:00.000Z	trashdeb	tushar	Are you trying to log into Facebook or Facebook Chat?
2012-08-30T03:16:00.000Z	trashdeb	tushar	That's not an answer. Do you want to see your Timeline or do you want to chat with your Facebook friends? You can only chat with your Facebook friends using Pidgin.
2012-08-30T03:17:00.000Z	trashdeb	tushar	Can you PM me?
