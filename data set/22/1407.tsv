2010-05-23T11:52:00.000Z	vbl		 when I play songs in ubuntu 8.04 LTS after sometime connection refused error is coming.. Any fix is availble for this.
2010-05-23T11:52:00.000Z	undecim	vbl	Do you have pulseaudio installed?
2010-05-23T11:53:00.000Z	undecim	vbl	I don't remember if it comes with 8.04 or not...
2010-05-23T11:53:00.000Z	vbl	undecim	I have installed
2010-05-23T11:53:00.000Z	vbl	undecim	It is 0.9.10
2010-05-23T11:54:00.000Z	undecim	vbl	maybe a problem with pulseaudio then. Do you get any more than "Connection Refused" or is there more text?
2010-05-23T11:55:00.000Z	vbl	undecim	I'm not getting any logs in syslogs.. when I open pavchooser. It shows me connection refused
2010-05-23T11:55:00.000Z	vbl	undecim	AFter this error player memory will increase to 1GB
2010-05-23T11:56:00.000Z	undecim	vbl	try running "killall pulseaudio" and if that doesn't work "killall -9 pulseaudio"
2010-05-23T11:57:00.000Z	undecim	vbl	That will kill the pulseaudio process and it should automatically restart. If it doesn't restart, your music app should fall back on ALSA
2010-05-23T11:57:00.000Z	vbl	undecim	After this error pulseaudio demaon itself will not be running
2010-05-23T11:58:00.000Z	vbl	undecim	when I kill pulseaudio in my pc. It is not autostarting...
2010-05-23T11:59:00.000Z	undecim	vbl	If it doesn't restart, then your applications should fall back on ALSA and play
2010-05-23T12:00:00.000Z	vbl	undecim	How to acheive that. I bit new to linux.. Can you help me..
2010-05-23T12:01:00.000Z	vbl	undecim	When I debug pulseaudio with -vvvv . I'm getting this error http://pastebin.com/embed_js.php?i=ZgE3dpxV in system log before connection refused. Can you check this please
2010-05-23T12:02:00.000Z	undecim	vbl	When pulseaudio is not running, your music should play. You may need to restart your player if pulse was running when it started.
2010-05-23T12:03:00.000Z	vbl	undecim	I can make the music come back by closing music player and typing pulseaudio -D.. Anyother good solution is there for this..
2010-05-23T12:04:00.000Z	undecim	vbl	Only thing I can suggest is removing pulse. That's what I did on my computer and sound system has been great since.
2010-05-23T12:04:00.000Z	undecim	vbl	But that also breaks a lot of sound-related features
2010-05-23T12:06:00.000Z	vbl	undecim	OK I can remove pulse. But my problem is making my 4 speaker work in ALSA. How to do that..???
2010-05-23T12:06:00.000Z	undecim	vbl	Sorry, I don't know much about setting up multiple speakers.
2010-05-23T12:07:00.000Z	vbl	undecim	Nice speaking to you.. I will try to ask anyone else here....
