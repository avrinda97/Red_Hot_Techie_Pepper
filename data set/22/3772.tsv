2009-01-06T04:27:00.000Z	yaris123456789		hey guys i am moving lot of image files from one server to another. but if i wget too fast, the server automatically throttles it. i cannot control the server hosting the image. so how to speed up this process without waiting 2 days for everything to transfer? run multiple instances of wget?
2009-01-06T04:29:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	that might be one way.. if the server doesn't realise both connections are from the same ip
2009-01-06T04:29:00.000Z	yaris123456789	Slart	yes
2009-01-16T02:22:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	grep
2009-01-16T02:22:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	or sed
2009-01-16T02:22:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	definately sed.. grep is more of a search tool
2009-01-16T02:22:00.000Z	yaris123456789	Slart	how do i use it with sed ? say replace 'sundays' with 'mondays'
2009-01-16T02:23:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	sed 's/sundays/mondays/' bigtextfile.txt I think
2009-01-16T02:24:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	it is a regexp.. s is a command of a sorts.. "search" perhaps?
2009-01-16T02:24:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	there are lots and lots of examples out there.. sed has been around for a long time
2009-01-16T02:46:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	commands that don't print out anything usually worked
2009-01-16T02:46:00.000Z	yaris123456789	Slart	no i mean it takes me to >
2009-01-16T02:47:00.000Z	yaris123456789	Slart	all isee is >
2009-01-16T02:47:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	ah.. probably a ' to much or little..
2009-01-16T02:47:00.000Z	yaris123456789	Slart	 eh ?
2009-01-16T02:47:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	press ctrl+c and check that command line again
2009-01-16T02:48:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	if you write.. echo 'test' it does just that.. writes test... but if you write echo 'test and press enter it waits for the next '.. and you get the > prompt
2009-05-14T11:32:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	wget does parallell downloads? sure?
2009-05-18T00:58:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	tried putting `` around that expression?
2009-05-18T21:47:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	you'll get an error
2009-05-18T21:47:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	hard links wouldn't delete the data until there are no more links pointing to it.. or something like that
2009-05-18T23:42:00.000Z	Slart	yaris123456789	check the wikipedia page for file system comparisons
