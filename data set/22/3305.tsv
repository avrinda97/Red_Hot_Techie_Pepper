2008-10-20T04:55:00.000Z	ASTURIAS	dulak	yes
2008-10-20T05:08:00.000Z	dulak	ASTURIAS	that's a huge problem, is /etc/passwd there?

2008-10-20T05:09:00.000Z	dulak	ASTURIAS	ok in passwd, is the second field for your username a *?

2008-10-20T05:11:00.000Z	dulak	ASTURIAS	ok good, you need to copy that shadow- file to shadow
2008-10-20T05:12:00.000Z	ASTURIAS	dulak	open it, and then create a new file called shadow and paste all the content in it?
2008-10-20T05:12:00.000Z	dulak	ASTURIAS	cp -a shadow- shadow
2008-10-20T05:12:00.000Z	dulak	ASTURIAS	then edit shadow, look for your username, blank out the second field
2008-10-20T05:13:00.000Z	ASTURIAS	dulak	should I try passwd again?
2008-10-20T05:14:00.000Z	dulak	ASTURIAS	sure
2008-10-20T05:14:00.000Z	ASTURIAS	dulak	passwd: password updated successfully
2008-10-20T05:15:00.000Z	dulak	ASTURIAS	ok you are set, somehow your shadow file got lost, you went to a backup and now you should be good
