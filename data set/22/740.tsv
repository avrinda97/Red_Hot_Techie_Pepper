2011-04-29T05:01:00.000Z	KNUBBIG		cool upgrade is taking about 3 hours to complete :@ that will be 5 am here ...
2011-04-29T05:02:00.000Z	lcb	KNUBBIG	it depends on your inter-speed ;)
2011-04-29T05:02:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	lcb	already downloaded, install is taking 3 hours
2011-04-29T05:02:00.000Z	lcb	KNUBBIG	did you upgrade before the distro upgrade?
2011-04-29T05:02:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	lcb	yes
2011-04-29T05:03:00.000Z	lcb	KNUBBIG	so you have loads of things installed :)
2011-04-29T05:03:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	lcb	seems true :p ~1900 packages to upgrade :D
2011-04-29T05:03:00.000Z	lcb	KNUBBIG	not too much .. :0
2011-04-29T05:04:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	lcb	than it's just my 5400 rpm hdd I think (+ 1.8 ghz dualcore)
2011-04-29T05:04:00.000Z	lcb	KNUBBIG	let it go, don't interrupt or you might get screwed
2011-04-29T05:05:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	lcb	yes I'm afraid of that, probably will just leave it running while sleeping :)
2011-04-29T05:06:00.000Z	lcb	KNUBBIG	yes. hopefully you don't have any pop-up prompts in meanwhile
2011-04-29T05:07:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	lcb	I'll freak out if I get up and it still says 2h to go, do you want to do that and that ;D
2011-04-29T05:07:00.000Z	lcb	KNUBBIG	just sleep well and don't have bad dreams about the end of the world :p
2011-04-29T05:08:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	lcb	I'll try, thanks :)
2011-04-29T05:12:00.000Z	lcb	KNUBBIG	don't play with grub while upgrading... go to sleep :p
2011-04-29T05:13:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	lcb	:D and then I'll wake up and my grub is destroyed *fears* :D
2011-04-29T05:14:00.000Z	lcb	KNUBBIG	SHIFT before loading ubuntu and just hit 'update grub' on the recovery menu, just in case
2011-04-29T05:14:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	lcb	thanks a lot
2011-04-29T05:14:00.000Z	lcb	KNUBBIG	but don't worry about that now.
2011-04-29T05:15:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	lcb	I don't worry that much I think, it should all go well (says the optimist)
2011-04-29T05:15:00.000Z	lcb	KNUBBIG	hehehe
