2009-05-09T00:24:00.000Z	ksbalaji		how to find the kernel version used by me from terminal?
2009-05-09T00:24:00.000Z	anodesni	ksbalaji	uname -r
2009-05-09T00:27:00.000Z	ksbalaji	anodesni	ah! thanks now, is 2.6.24-24-generic faulty? it is slow to open apps. The display is slow, sound is not continuous? help?
2009-05-09T00:27:00.000Z	anodesni	ksbalaji	maybe a driver problem
2009-05-09T00:28:00.000Z	anodesni	ksbalaji	what are your hardware specs
2009-05-09T00:28:00.000Z	ksbalaji	anodesni	driver not going smooth with kernel? sometimes a kernel update gives this.
2009-05-09T00:28:00.000Z	ksbalaji	anodesni	how to get hw specs for you?
2009-05-09T00:29:00.000Z	anodesni	ksbalaji	don't you know them? Your processor and ram for example?
2009-05-09T00:30:00.000Z	ksbalaji	anodesni	mine is intel dual core 2.8 cpu, 1GB ram.
2009-05-09T00:30:00.000Z	anodesni	ksbalaji	that is more than enough
2009-05-09T00:31:00.000Z	ksbalaji	anodesni	but after the kernel update, I find my display and sound slow.
2009-05-09T00:31:00.000Z	anodesni	ksbalaji	try to start "top" in terminal and see if a program uses much CPU time
2009-05-09T00:31:00.000Z	anodesni	ksbalaji	you could consider booting from the last kernel
2009-05-09T00:31:00.000Z	ksbalaji	anodesni	let me try.
2009-05-09T00:32:00.000Z	ksbalaji	anodesni	too much info for me to digest.
2009-05-09T00:33:00.000Z	ksbalaji	anodesni	I see four color charts in four rows with many columns.
2009-05-09T00:33:00.000Z	anodesni	ksbalaji	just look under %CPU at the first process and see how much cpu it uses and what process it is under COMMAND
2009-05-09T00:35:00.000Z	anodesni	ksbalaji	I recommend to just use the previous kernel. Reboot and choose from the grub boot menu the previous kernel version.
2009-05-09T00:38:00.000Z	ksbalaji	anodesni	yeah this seems a better solution. But since you told about top - can I upload a sreenshot for a suggestion from you please?
2009-05-09T00:38:00.000Z	anodesni	ksbalaji	sure
2009-05-09T00:38:00.000Z	anodesni	ksbalaji	although I haven't got much time, I have to go in a couple of minutes
2009-05-09T00:39:00.000Z	ksbalaji	anodesni	np. thanks some other time then.
