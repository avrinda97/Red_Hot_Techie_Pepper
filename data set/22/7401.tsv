2006-04-05T09:16:00.000Z	pkh		anyone know when we can expect wpa to be available?
2006-04-05T09:16:00.000Z	ubuntulnx	pkh	in what?
2006-04-05T09:16:00.000Z	pkh	ubuntulnx	the wireless network configuration gui.
2006-04-05T09:16:00.000Z	ubuntulnx	pkh	don't know about that, but wifi-radar has wpa
2006-04-05T09:17:00.000Z	pkh	ubuntulnx	or can I deal with it via command-line for configuration of my wireless card?
2006-04-05T09:17:00.000Z	ubuntulnx	pkh	i use wifi-radar, it's a really strong tool, i tend to avoid command-line if i can
2006-04-05T09:21:00.000Z	pkh	ubuntulnx	where it says driver under wpa, what goes there?
2006-04-05T09:21:00.000Z	ubuntulnx	pkh	for wifi-radar?
2006-04-05T09:21:00.000Z	pkh	ubuntulnx	yes
2006-04-05T09:21:00.000Z	ubuntulnx	pkh	have your tried your wpa key?
2006-04-05T09:22:00.000Z	ubuntulnx	pkh	i'm not sure that seems weird, i'd just try the key
2006-04-05T09:22:00.000Z	pkh	ubuntulnx	it is, weird choice of words...
2006-04-05T09:23:00.000Z	ubuntulnx	pkh	did your key work
2006-04-05T09:23:00.000Z	pkh	ubuntulnx	yes.  p.s. can you recommend a rss client?
2006-04-05T09:23:00.000Z	ubuntulnx	pkh	don't use any rss clients...give me a sec and i'll see...
2006-04-05T09:24:00.000Z	ubuntulnx	pkh	i know gdesklets has several rss clients
2006-04-05T09:24:00.000Z	ubuntulnx	pkh	i would search synaptic see what comes up and go with that
2006-04-05T09:24:00.000Z	pkh	ubuntulnx	-- gdesklets comes standard?
2006-04-05T09:25:00.000Z	pkh	ubuntulnx	I did -- there were like 20+, and there's usually a 'normal' one that everyone uses and is integrated well into the standard install...
2006-04-05T09:25:00.000Z	ubuntulnx	pkh	sudo apt-get install gdesklets
2006-04-05T09:25:00.000Z	ubuntulnx	pkh	there's a whole bunch that come by default
2006-04-05T09:26:00.000Z	ubuntulnx	pkh	sorry, i'm not sure
