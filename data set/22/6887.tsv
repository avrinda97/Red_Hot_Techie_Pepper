2007-01-28T11:35:00.000Z	davidjohnston		i don't know if this would be an appropriate channel to ask this or not, but I am planning a restructure of my home network...it is going to have multiple OS's involved, but primarily Linux.  I was wondering if anyone might want to give their insight
2007-01-28T11:35:00.000Z	bwlang	davidjohnston	it
2007-01-28T11:36:00.000Z	bwlang	davidjohnston	's slow, just ask
2007-01-28T11:36:00.000Z	davidjohnston	bwlang	what
2007-01-28T11:36:00.000Z	bwlang	davidjohnston	an "go"
2007-01-28T11:36:00.000Z	davidjohnston	bwlang	what are you talking about
2007-01-28T11:37:00.000Z	bwlang	davidjohnston	it's slow, just ask (not much happening here)
2007-01-28T11:37:00.000Z	bwlang	davidjohnston	i just got an extra cr in there...
2007-01-28T11:37:00.000Z	bwlang	davidjohnston	what's "an go"
2007-01-28T11:43:00.000Z	davidjohnston	bwlang	 true....not vlans I was just spitting out ideas without thinking
2007-01-28T11:48:00.000Z	bwlang	davidjohnston	 i think you want to start with a nice linux server running samba to share files with the mac and any windows clients...
2007-01-28T11:51:00.000Z	bwlang	davidjohnston	i keep windows servers in virtual machines... so they can be rolled back as they get crufty... vmware server is great
2007-01-28T11:52:00.000Z	bwlang	davidjohnston	based on your level of network knowledge I recommend strongly that you not consult on network security... you're just asking for trouble.
2007-01-28T11:53:00.000Z	bwlang	davidjohnston	vmware server is free (you may have workstation - which is also nice , but not the same)
2007-01-28T11:55:00.000Z	bwlang	davidjohnston	that's a $10k *gift*... uh
2007-01-28T11:55:00.000Z	davidjohnston	bwlang	are you referring to consulting charges
2007-01-28T11:56:00.000Z	davidjohnston	bwlang	???

2007-01-28T11:58:00.000Z	davidjohnston	bwlang	so what's yoru point
2007-01-28T11:58:00.000Z	bwlang	davidjohnston	point is that I think you might be a software pirate... and i don't really want to to help you any more.
2007-01-28T12:00:00.000Z	davidjohnston	bwlang	 oh nevermind that's fine I completely understand now...trust me i am not I just work for a company that likes me to develop across multiple systems...One last question...I have always used SuSe linux, is Ubuntu worth all the hype...I am planning on setting up at least two linux servers and one linux desktop
2007-01-28T12:00:00.000Z	davidjohnston	bwlang	 then I will leave you alone, and why would you come to an open-source piece of software channel to pirate software
