2009-12-09T11:10:00.000Z	lostinspace_46		How does one create a  filename.pc file?
2009-12-09T11:10:00.000Z	DerKlempner	lostinspace_46	"touch filename.pc"
2009-12-09T11:14:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	DerKlempner	 may have misspoke.  I need it made with info in it..like made from <cmake> or whatever creates them.
2009-12-09T11:16:00.000Z	DerKlempner	lostinspace_46	Dunno what program it's used by, so you'd have to give more info.

2009-12-09T11:19:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	DerKlempner	 configure: error: Package requirements (gtk+-2.0 >= 2.6.0 sqlite3 >= 3.0) were not met:
2009-12-09T11:19:00.000Z	DerKlempner	lostinspace_46	What *program*?
2009-12-09T11:19:00.000Z	lostinspace_46		gfa-0.4.1
2009-12-09T11:20:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	DerKlempner	 From the terminal  Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
2009-12-09T11:20:00.000Z	lostinspace_46		installed software in a non-standard prefix.
2009-12-09T11:20:00.000Z	DerKlempner	lostinspace_46	Looks like you need to make sure you have gtk+-2.0 v2.6.0 (or higher) and sqlite3 v3.0 (or higher) installed first.
2009-12-09T11:21:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	DerKlempner	I do
2009-12-09T11:21:00.000Z	DerKlempner	lostinspace_46	Try updating them with "sudo apt-get upgrade" first.
2009-12-09T11:22:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	DerKlempner	I just think gfa-0.4.1 is looking in the wrong place.  Would I need to update a brqand new install?
2009-12-09T11:23:00.000Z	DerKlempner	lostinspace_46	Well, you can do a search for the dependencies, then add the path to them as an option when you configure.
2009-12-09T11:23:00.000Z	DerKlempner	lostinspace_46	But no need to do a new install.
2009-12-09T11:24:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	DerKlempner	And therin lies the rub, I don't have the .pc files for to use the path option with.
2009-12-09T11:25:00.000Z	DerKlempner	lostinspace_46	Do some more research on the install and files needed.  There may be a kludge you can use without having to reinstall.
2009-12-09T11:26:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	DerKlempner	I meant I have a brand new install of karmic
2009-12-09T11:26:00.000Z	DerKlempner	lostinspace_46	But without knowing what program you're trying to compile I can't tell you anything more.
2009-12-09T11:26:00.000Z	lostinspace_46	DerKlempner	 I is a address book  gfa-0.4.1
2009-12-09T11:29:00.000Z	DerKlempner	lostinspace_46	See my private message I sent to you.
