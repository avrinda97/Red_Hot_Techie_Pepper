2009-06-20T19:26:00.000Z	Noobuntu		it shows up completly blank
2009-06-20T19:26:00.000Z	Noobuntu		which is difficult
2009-06-20T19:26:00.000Z	Noobuntu		So?
2009-06-20T19:27:00.000Z	Noobuntu		Edit files in the /ect directory
2009-06-20T19:28:00.000Z	Noobuntu		Because I am having some problems that supposedly can be fixed by editing the text
2009-06-20T19:28:00.000Z	Noobuntu		for example
2009-06-20T19:28:00.000Z	Noobuntu		http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202838
2009-06-20T19:28:00.000Z	Noobuntu		Ok
2009-06-20T19:29:00.000Z	Noobuntu		And when I open the config file, it comes up empty
2009-06-20T19:30:00.000Z	Noobuntu		Does anyone know what I should do?
2009-06-20T19:31:00.000Z	oskar-	Noobuntu	 what command do you use to open the file? does the file exist? do you have read permissions on the file? what messages do you see on the console from the editor?
2009-06-20T19:32:00.000Z	oskar-	Noobuntu	 ls -l /etc/modprobe.d/aliases
2009-06-20T19:34:00.000Z	oskar-	Noobuntu	 who says they should? maybe they should really, i don't know...
2009-06-20T19:37:00.000Z	oskar-	Noobuntu	 my ubuntu has no file /etc/modprobe.d/aliases (it obviously had one once). the thread is very old and maybe obsolete
2009-06-20T19:40:00.000Z	oskar-	Noobuntu	 it should not exists though
2009-06-20T19:42:00.000Z	oskar-	Noobuntu	 do yourself a favour and don't believe in these tuning guides. i also tried many of them. they lead you away from the "path of the distribution" to a complicated and nearly not faster system
2009-06-20T19:42:00.000Z	oskar-	Noobuntu	 i would only manually edit something, if there is a real need, a problem or so
2009-06-20T19:43:00.000Z	oskar-	Noobuntu	 if you need an alias or xorg.conf file, you can simply create one. they should be recognized at the next boot
2009-06-20T19:44:00.000Z	Noobuntu	oskar-	Will they also be filled out?
2009-06-20T19:44:00.000Z	oskar-	Noobuntu	 you have to manually create them
2009-06-20T19:49:00.000Z	oskar-	Noobuntu	 in that case a xorg.conf file could help. please ask the others here, how to create one fitting for your graphics hardware
2009-06-20T19:50:00.000Z	Noobuntu	oskar-	Thanks :)
