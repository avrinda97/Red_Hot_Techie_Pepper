2010-04-15T00:50:00.000Z	magn3ts		I will paypal $50 to anyone that can make my touchpad stop respodning to taps as clicks.
2010-04-15T00:50:00.000Z	magn3ts		I've been asking about this for 2 weeks and no one can help me. I'm at my wits end.
2010-04-15T00:52:00.000Z	magn3ts		this is an option in gnome-mouse-properties but it doesn't fraking work
2010-04-15T00:52:00.000Z	magn3ts		at all
2010-04-15T00:52:00.000Z	crucialhoax	magn3ts	Edit that feature using gconf-editor. I will get you the key, one sec
2010-04-15T00:54:00.000Z	crucialhoax	magn3ts	in a terminal type `gconf-editor` then when it opens, browse to desktop/gnome/peripherals/touchpad/ then untick the tap_to_click box
2010-04-15T00:54:00.000Z	magn3ts	crucialhoax	don't bother, its already disabled in gconf-editor. The key is /desktop/gnome/peripherals/touchpad/tap_to_click
2010-04-15T00:54:00.000Z	crucialhoax	magn3ts	And that key does not do it?
2010-04-15T00:54:00.000Z	magn3ts	crucialhoax	nope. it ignores it. If I check it and then uncheck it, it works for about 10 minutes
2010-04-15T00:55:00.000Z	crucialhoax	magn3ts	Have you tried syndaemon? maybe that will do it.
2010-04-15T00:55:00.000Z	magn3ts	crucialhoax	I've yet to have luck with it either to be honest
2010-04-15T00:56:00.000Z	crucialhoax	magn3ts	Hm, mine works quite well. Let me give you the syndaemon I am running, just to try it :)
2010-04-15T00:56:00.000Z	crucialhoax	magn3ts	syndaemon -i 1 -d -K
2010-04-15T01:01:00.000Z	magn3ts	crucialhoax	would that have to be applied at every boot or how does syndaemon work?
2010-04-15T01:01:00.000Z	crucialhoax	magn3ts	Yes, it does. I added it to the startup programs.
2010-04-15T01:01:00.000Z	crucialhoax	magn3ts	It sticks through every boot.
2010-04-15T01:01:00.000Z	magn3ts	crucialhoax	okay I'll give it a shot
2010-04-15T01:02:00.000Z	crucialhoax	magn3ts	Just add it to the `Startup Applications` did you want the command again?
2010-04-15T01:02:00.000Z	magn3ts	crucialhoax	no I got it
2010-04-15T04:18:00.000Z	crucialhoax	magn3ts	Rip the cd as an .iso
2010-04-15T04:18:00.000Z	magn3ts	crucialhoax	its a cdr file
2010-04-15T04:18:00.000Z	crucialhoax	magn3ts	Sorry, I thought you meant, a CD-R... Oops.
