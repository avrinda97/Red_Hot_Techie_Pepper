2011-11-29T22:03:00.000Z	sanitypassing		Okay, I seem to have totally ruined my installation.
2011-11-29T22:04:00.000Z	sanitypassing		can I do sudo apt-get purge ubuntu-desktop && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop to fix the damned thing?
2011-11-29T22:04:00.000Z	auronandace	sanitypassing	thats nice dear, time to reinstall, yay!
2011-11-29T22:05:00.000Z	sanitypassing	auronandace	I actidentially removed Unity (I'm an idiot...), and then I screwed up X when I tried to enable my second monitor. D:
2011-11-29T22:06:00.000Z	auronandace	sanitypassing	i don't use unity (i prefer xfce)
2011-11-29T22:06:00.000Z	auronandace	sanitypassing	i've heard that unity has problems with more than one screen
2011-11-29T22:06:00.000Z	sanitypassing	auronandace	I don't like Unity as well, but the "GNOME Classic" options isn't much better.
2011-11-29T22:07:00.000Z	sanitypassing		Argh./
2011-11-29T22:07:00.000Z	auronandace	sanitypassing	give xfce or lxde a try, you might like them
2011-11-29T22:07:00.000Z	sanitypassing	auronandace	I've tried 'em, a while a go. I wasn't a fan.
2011-11-29T22:08:00.000Z	sanitypassing		Still...
2011-11-29T22:08:00.000Z	sanitypassing		sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop?
2011-11-29T22:08:00.000Z	sanitypassing		Not too much, I'm afraid.
2011-11-29T22:09:00.000Z	sanitypassing		I do hope that it fixes the issue with my damned monitor
2011-11-29T22:09:00.000Z	sanitypassing		I was able to enable it well enough, but now I have no panels!
2011-11-29T22:10:00.000Z	auronandace	sanitypassing	thats more of a graphics card issue than a desktop one
2011-11-29T22:10:00.000Z	sanitypassing		I removed Unity, but the screen issue is unrelated.
2011-11-29T22:10:00.000Z	sanitypassing		I attempted to enable the second monitor through the NVIDIA control panel, and when I restarted X, there we no panels.
2011-11-29T22:10:00.000Z	sanitypassing		I can open windows, but without the panels, I can't do much
2011-11-29T22:11:00.000Z	auronandace	sanitypassing	can't you just add new panels
2011-11-29T22:11:00.000Z	sanitypassing	auronandace	if I knew how, maybe.
2011-11-29T22:12:00.000Z	auronandace	sanitypassing	i know how in xfce :)
