2006-07-28T08:12:00.000Z	help-the-n00b		How can I connect to a remote computer's FS??
2006-07-28T08:13:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	after you have mounted it?
2006-07-28T08:14:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	um, "mount" is used to mount refote fs's
2006-07-28T08:15:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	remote, rather
2006-07-28T08:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	help-the-n00b okay
2006-07-28T08:24:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	did you get my /msg?
2006-07-28T08:24:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	no
2006-07-28T08:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	-t fstypehere, i would guess
2006-07-28T08:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	nfs?
2006-07-28T08:27:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	-t nfs
2006-07-28T08:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	the remote machine needs to see something like "ext3" but the nfs daemon on the remote end translates all to type nfs before interacting with incoming calls
2006-07-28T08:29:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	to use what you said as example: sudo mount remotemachineaddress:/paths/and/stuff /your/local/mountpoint
2006-07-28T08:31:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	correction: sudo mount -t nfs remotemachineaddress:/paths/and/stuff /your/local/mountpoint (ut's just that -t nfs has always been autosensed for me)
2006-07-29T05:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	one good console irc client is irssi
2006-07-29T05:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	sudo apt-get install irssi
2006-07-29T05:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	then just run "irsii" in console
2006-07-29T05:38:00.000Z	help-the-n00b	eyequeue	 What! I thought it was terminal based?
2006-07-29T05:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	apt-get is a console command too
2006-07-29T05:46:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	/help server
2006-07-29T05:46:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	also /help connect, for irssi
2006-07-29T05:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	sudo apt-get install thunderbird
2006-07-29T05:50:00.000Z	eyequeue	help-the-n00b	sudo apt-get install mozilla-thunderbird (they shoretened firefoxes name, but not thunderbird's?
