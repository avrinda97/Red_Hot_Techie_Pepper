2009-03-12T13:01:00.000Z	BlackAeronaut		Help!  Trying to install Ubuntu 64-Bit 8.10 onto a Toshiba Satellite A355D series laptop (AMD Turion x2 64-Bit) - installation never finishes, it just dumps me into Terminal.
2009-03-12T13:01:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	BlackAeronaut	does it give you any sort of error or status message?
2009-03-12T13:02:00.000Z	BlackAeronaut	DinkyDogg	Negative.  Just the prompt: ubuntu@ubuntu:~$
2009-03-12T13:02:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	BlackAeronaut	that's weird. Dunno what to tell you.
2009-03-12T13:03:00.000Z	BlackAeronaut	DinkyDogg	Tried running startx, but I get a weird error.
2009-03-12T13:04:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	BlackAeronaut	there's your problem. USA is where it's at :)
2009-03-12T13:05:00.000Z	BlackAeronaut	DinkyDogg	They got the best servers here in Japan, dude.  :p
2009-03-12T13:07:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	BlackAeronaut	i've never used the windows install, dunno how reliable it is
2009-03-12T13:07:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	BlackAeronaut	you can always try a live CD install, those are more common
2009-03-12T13:09:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	BlackAeronaut	if you can figure out how to burn a working Live CD, you'd probably have better luck
2009-03-12T13:09:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	BlackAeronaut	wubi is the name of the ubuntu installer from windows
2009-03-12T13:10:00.000Z	BlackAeronaut	DinkyDogg	For whatever reason, I get the same damn results running live CD.
2009-03-12T13:10:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	BlackAeronaut	okay, that's weird
2009-03-12T13:14:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	BlackAeronaut	it's a bit of a pain. YOu'd be better off burning a live CD
2009-03-12T13:15:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	BlackAeronaut	winmd5sum will check the checksum for you, but i doubt that's your problem
2009-03-12T13:20:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	BlackAeronaut	that clears it up. You obviously don't have a monitor. Go out and buy one.
2009-03-12T13:20:00.000Z	BlackAeronaut	DinkyDogg	Your kidding, right?
2009-03-12T13:32:00.000Z	BlackAeronaut	DinkyDogg	You think my problems could stem from Toshiba's rabid support of Vista?
2009-03-12T13:32:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	BlackAeronaut	it's probably not intentional on anyone's part
2009-03-12T13:32:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	BlackAeronaut	i'm guessing it has to do with your unusual install setup
2009-03-12T13:32:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	BlackAeronaut	oh, wait, but you said live cd has the same problem :/
2009-03-12T13:33:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	BlackAeronaut	i really don't know what the problem is. Have you googled for the error you pastebin'd?
