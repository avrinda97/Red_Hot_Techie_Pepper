2008-08-26T07:56:00.000Z	Flannel	tsuna27	~/.themes is a location.  ~ is your homedir
2008-08-26T07:57:00.000Z	Flannel	tsuna27	go to places > home folder, and then hit ctrl-h to show hidden files, and then there will either be a .themes folder, or you'll need to makeone.
2008-11-02T11:51:00.000Z	Flannel	tsuna27	edit your boot.ini to make the ubuntu entry default
2008-11-02T11:52:00.000Z	Flannel	tsuna27	with a text editor would work.
2008-11-02T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	tsuna27	There's a default line there, change it to the other one.
2008-11-02T11:54:00.000Z	Flannel	tsuna27	in your boot.ini, there's a line default= blah blah blah, then an [operating systems] separator, and then lines for your OSes, change the default line
2008-11-02T11:54:00.000Z	Flannel	tsuna27	C:\boot.ini
2008-11-02T11:57:00.000Z	tsuna27	Flannel	im a total newb how can i find C:\boot.ini
2008-11-02T11:58:00.000Z	Flannel	tsuna27	Er... C:\ is your windows drive... boot.ini is a file there.  Its easiest to do in windows, let me actually remember the dialog name.
2008-11-02T11:59:00.000Z	Flannel	tsuna27	It's not.  It's in windows
2008-11-02T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	tsuna27	Alright, go to run, type "msconfig" then go to the boot.ini tab, click the ubuntu entry, and hit "set as default"
2008-11-02T12:12:00.000Z	tsuna27	Flannel	ah i did what u said but now i lost my AWN dock
2008-11-02T12:12:00.000Z	Flannel	tsuna27	That makes no sense.  Changing your boot order will make no difference to anything in Ubuntu
2008-11-02T12:13:00.000Z	tsuna27	Flannel	what can i do 2 get it back
2008-11-02T12:13:00.000Z	Flannel	tsuna27	turn it on again, reenable, whatever.
2008-11-02T12:14:00.000Z	tsuna27	Flannel	also how can i share files btw my OS's for example share songs from XP on2 ubuntu w/o copying all the songs
2008-11-02T12:26:00.000Z	tsuna27	Flannel	how can i get my music from XP 2 play on ubuntu w/o copying again
2008-11-02T12:27:00.000Z	Flannel	tsuna27	Normally you can just mount/read your NTFS drives, but I have no idea regarding if thats doable with wubi.
2008-11-02T13:04:00.000Z	tsuna27	Flannel	where would my pictures of icons be located
2008-11-02T13:05:00.000Z	Flannel	tsuna27	Um, /usr/share/... pixmaps?
2009-12-28T09:17:00.000Z	Flannel	tsuna27	you can't upgrade from 8.10 to 9.10 directly, you need to upgrade through 9.04, and no, it shouldn't
