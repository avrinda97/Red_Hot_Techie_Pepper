2007-08-01T05:25:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	reverseblade	you work in an office where people develop using .net? :(
2007-08-01T05:26:00.000Z	reverseblade	howlingmadhowi1	sort of, there are some .net developers like me
2007-08-01T05:27:00.000Z	reverseblade	howlingmadhowi1	but manager is a .net guy and wants us to do all the stuff with .net
2007-08-01T05:27:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	reverseblade	i hope you never get any productive work done. your presence on #ubuntu is definitely a good sign :)
2007-08-01T05:28:00.000Z	reverseblade	howlingmadhowi1	what do you mean ? I am using ubuntu since 2005 also
2007-08-01T05:28:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	reverseblade	i just have a bad kneejerk reaction when it comes to microsoft .net
2007-08-01T05:30:00.000Z	reverseblade	howlingmadhowi1	think about it.  almost every windows .net application works out box with ubuntu without wine and vice versa. This is reality now , mono is soo matured
2007-08-01T05:31:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	reverseblade	and then microsoft will subtly change the standards...
2007-08-01T05:32:00.000Z	reverseblade	howlingmadhowi1	that's a long discussed issue . C# is an ECMA standard language and is not controlled my MS. The only parts could be problem are Windows Forms, and ASP.NET. Miguel explained if MS makes such a move, they will drop the support for these technologies and mono still will be a good project
2007-08-01T05:32:00.000Z	reverseblade	howlingmadhowi1	it's no big deal on the contrary to some people believe
2007-08-01T05:43:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	reverseblade	good for miguel. i wonder if others would do the same
2007-08-01T05:43:00.000Z	reverseblade	howlingmadhowi1	errr, do you know who is miguel ?
2007-08-01T05:44:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	reverseblade	you mentioned the name.
2007-08-01T05:44:00.000Z	reverseblade	howlingmadhowi1	right. Miguel De Icaza, co-founder of the gnome project and founder of mono project.
2007-08-01T05:45:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	reverseblade	oh, okay :) i remember reading something about him recently. he's meant to be really good
2007-08-01T05:45:00.000Z	reverseblade	howlingmadhowi1	yeah
2007-08-01T05:47:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	reverseblade	i seem to remember linus starting a flamewar with him :)
2007-08-01T05:49:00.000Z	reverseblade	howlingmadhowi1	who else hasn't linus started a flamewar ? After all he said, "Subversion is the most pointless project ever". Also linus doesn't like gnome we all know
2007-08-01T05:50:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	reverseblade	i find it all pretty healthy. the day there are no flamewars going on between free software projects is the day something is going seriously wrong
2007-08-01T05:50:00.000Z	reverseblade	howlingmadhowi1	I agree
2007-08-01T05:50:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	reverseblade	and to linus's eternal credit, he did actually sit down and contribute code (though i don't know if it was any good), so he wasn't just being a troll
2007-08-01T05:51:00.000Z	reverseblade	howlingmadhowi1	you are right at one thing that he really does have an eternal credit
