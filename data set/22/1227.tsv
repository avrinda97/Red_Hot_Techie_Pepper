2010-08-19T11:44:00.000Z	Aliselyn		ok, trying to install wvdial-1.61.tar.gz with tar -xvzf wvdial-1.61.tar.gz and I'm getting this error "cannot open: no such file or directory" I have the file on the desktop, so I'm not sure what is going wrong (sorry, very new at this)
2010-08-19T11:45:00.000Z	dooglus	Aliselyn	try just: tar xf wv*gz
2010-08-19T11:45:00.000Z	Aliselyn	dooglus	same error
2010-08-19T11:49:00.000Z	dooglus	Aliselyn	type "cd; cd Desktop" first
2010-08-19T11:49:00.000Z	dooglus	Aliselyn	to make sure you're "in" the right place
2010-08-19T11:50:00.000Z	Aliselyn	dooglus	thank you, that worked perfectly (I really didn't know how to navigate via terminal, thank you)
2010-08-19T11:51:00.000Z	dooglus	Aliselyn	"cd" is "change directory".  just "cd" on its own takes you "home"
2010-08-19T11:52:00.000Z	Aliselyn	dooglus	I wasn't sure if the same held true for ubuntu as windws, and cd.. didn't work :)
2010-08-19T11:52:00.000Z	dooglus	Aliselyn	"cd .." needs a space in ubuntu
2010-08-19T11:53:00.000Z	Aliselyn	dooglus	ahh, that explains it
2010-08-19T11:57:00.000Z	Aliselyn	dooglus	does the tar -xvzf just extract it, or does it install?
2010-08-19T11:58:00.000Z	dooglus	Aliselyn	what you have there is a source code archive I expect.  you'll need to extract (you did it), compile, and install it.  you probably can find a package though where that's all done for you
2010-08-19T11:59:00.000Z	dooglus	Aliselyn	wvdial is in the ubuntu repositories, ready to install from the software centre:
2010-08-19T12:02:00.000Z	Aliselyn	dooglus	thank you, but I'm still getting errors when I try to compile it
2010-08-19T12:02:00.000Z	dooglus	Aliselyn	don't try to compile it - just install it from the software centre
2010-08-19T12:03:00.000Z	dooglus	Aliselyn	see at the bottom of the 'applications' menu?
2010-08-19T12:03:00.000Z	Aliselyn	dooglus	I'm not connected to the internet on ubuntu. I need wvdial working so I can attempt to get it to connect to dialup
2010-08-19T12:04:00.000Z	Aliselyn	dooglus	I'm currently on my desktop, and ubuntu is on my laptop
2010-08-19T12:04:00.000Z	dooglus	Aliselyn	ubuntu 10.04?
2010-08-19T12:05:00.000Z	Aliselyn	dooglus	yes
2010-08-19T12:15:00.000Z	Aliselyn	dooglus	ok, so I cannot get wvdial to work, even with a deb.... I'm going to try gnome-ppp next, and hope that works
2010-08-19T12:20:00.000Z	Aliselyn	dooglus	busy?
