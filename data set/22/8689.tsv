2006-06-02T12:09:00.000Z	disasm		with dapper, trying to get bcm4306 to work, got bcm43xx-firmware from cafuego's mirror, anything I have to do after that for it to work?
2006-06-02T12:10:00.000Z	concept10	disasm	you have to extract the firmware
2006-06-02T12:11:00.000Z	concept10	disasm	using bcm43xx-fwcutter - Utility for extracting Broadcom 43xx firmware
2006-06-02T12:11:00.000Z	concept10	disasm	apt-get install that and extract to lib/firmware
2006-06-02T12:11:00.000Z	disasm	concept10	doesn't the bcm43xx-firmware from cafuego's repos have already extracted firmware?
2006-06-02T12:12:00.000Z	disasm	concept10	it puts a bunch of stuff in /lib/firmware
2006-06-02T12:12:00.000Z	concept10	disasm	is it one file?
2006-06-02T12:12:00.000Z	concept10	disasm	you should have files such as bcm43xx_initval05.fw    bcm43xx_microcode2.fw
2006-06-02T12:13:00.000Z	concept10	disasm	if you dont have files like that in lib/firmware, you need to extract the firmware using the fwcutter
2006-06-02T12:13:00.000Z	concept10	disasm	its easy, takes a second
2006-06-02T12:14:00.000Z	disasm	concept10	initval01-initval10 microcodede2-5,11 and pcm4-5
2006-06-02T12:14:00.000Z	disasm	concept10	so with that stuff in /lib/firmware it should just work?
2006-06-02T12:15:00.000Z	concept10	disasm	you had those already?
2006-06-02T12:16:00.000Z	disasm	concept10	yeah
2006-06-02T12:16:00.000Z	concept10	disasm	do you have the module (driver) loaded? lsmod | grep bcm43
2006-06-02T12:16:00.000Z	disasm	concept10	http://ubuntu.cafuego.net/dists/dapper-cafuego/bcm43xx/ that's where I got them, yeah, it's loaded shows as eth1
2006-06-02T12:18:00.000Z	disasm	concept10	you think it would work better if I just used fwcutter? or is there a step I'm missing?
2006-06-02T12:20:00.000Z	concept10	disasm	im not sure, BUT .. if you grabbed the firmware after the driver was already loaded, rmmod (the two modules) and modprobe bcm43...blah ... this way it will load the proper firmware
2006-06-02T12:21:00.000Z	disasm	concept10	I think we got it, thanks!
2006-06-02T12:21:00.000Z	disasm	concept10	was deactivated ;-)
2006-06-02T12:21:00.000Z	concept10	disasm	you rmmod and modprobe and that worked?
2006-06-02T12:22:00.000Z	disasm	concept10	did that a while ago, had to enable the device
