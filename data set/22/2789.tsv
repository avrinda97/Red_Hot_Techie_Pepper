2011-03-14T18:56:00.000Z	liminal		my applications keep crashing due to Segmentation faults
2011-03-14T18:56:00.000Z	liminal		any ideas on the causes?
2011-03-14T18:57:00.000Z	liminal		seemlying so.
2011-03-14T18:57:00.000Z	liminal		some worse than others
2011-03-14T18:58:00.000Z	liminal		cooling my cpu temp is below 40
2011-03-14T18:58:00.000Z	liminal		ram wise ive memory checked okay and changed sticks regardless
2011-03-14T18:59:00.000Z	sipior	liminal	try running an application under strace, and see what it spits out immediately prior to the segfault.
2011-03-14T19:01:00.000Z	sipior	liminal	try "sudo apt-get install strace", and then "sudo strace <program>".
2011-03-14T19:02:00.000Z	sipior	liminal	there will be a fair bit of output; consider redirecting it to a file with tee or the like: "sudo strace <program> | tee <logfile>
2011-03-14T19:07:00.000Z	liminal	sipior	it just crashed with strace running - it seems to check the system clock alot not sure what that means
2011-03-14T19:08:00.000Z	sipior	liminal	what were you running?
2011-03-14T19:09:00.000Z	sipior	liminal	seems fairly random. does the same thing happen if you run applications from a live cd?
2011-03-14T19:12:00.000Z	sipior	liminal	the idea is to see if the problem lies with the system as installed, or with your hardware.
2011-03-14T19:15:00.000Z	sipior	liminal	the idea is to see if system ram is a problem.
2011-03-14T19:15:00.000Z	sipior	liminal	or perhaps a misconfigured installation.
2011-03-14T19:16:00.000Z	sipior	liminal	no.
2011-03-14T19:16:00.000Z	sipior	liminal	of course it does.
2011-03-14T19:18:00.000Z	sipior	liminal	look, we're just trying to get another data point on your system's behaviour. try it, or don't try it, i don't really care.
2011-03-14T19:19:00.000Z	sipior	liminal	we are trying to establish if your hardware is at fault.
2011-03-14T19:19:00.000Z	sipior	liminal	i have explained this before.
2011-03-14T19:20:00.000Z	liminal	sipior	right.. so if its hardware your saying the livecd will still crash right?
2011-03-14T19:20:00.000Z	sipior	liminal	that's the idea.
