2005-12-24T16:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		Given HP's recent support for Linux stuff, is it a safe assumption that a brand-new HP laptop would create few problems installing Breezy?
2005-12-24T16:19:00.000Z	eobanb	tonyyarusso	it depends on the hardware
2005-12-24T16:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	eobanb	Meaning?  Is it still totally up in the air until I know all the parts, or is there some trend to their track record?
2005-12-24T16:21:00.000Z	eobanb	tonyyarusso	are you looking at a specific model of laptop from HP?
2005-12-24T16:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	eobanb	I'm preparing for possibly helping a friend migrate.  Unfortunately, I haven't gotten the model information from her yet, so I don't know specifics at this time.
2005-12-24T16:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	eobanb	Does HP have anything like the IBM ThinkPad buttons, and thus something corresponding to tpb?
2005-12-24T16:24:00.000Z	eobanb	tonyyarusso	just about everything should work.  it's possible that very specialized hardware like infrared ports or card readers will not work properly, but ubuntu's track record on hardware support is very very good.
2005-12-24T16:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	eobanb	There is a card reader on it (one of the all-in-one types), I know that.  IR, I don't think so.  So I'll just keep that part in mind, and see if I can find anything about that part later.
2005-12-24T16:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	eobanb	Everything on my computer ran out of the box except the winmodem, which was a quick package install once I figured out what I needed, so that was all pretty sweet.
2005-12-24T16:29:00.000Z	eobanb	tonyyarusso	usually if the card readers are internal usb devices it works fine as usb mass storage.  with laptops there can be all kinds of weird stuff, from detecting lids being closed to screen adjustment buttons or media keys or the aforementioned fingerprint readers or broadcom wireless cards...
2005-12-24T16:32:00.000Z	eobanb	tonyyarusso	i'm not sure.
2005-12-24T16:33:00.000Z	eobanb	tonyyarusso	check the ubuntu forums
2006-01-08T11:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	eobanb	Can you change passwords from a Live CD?!?
2006-01-08T11:32:00.000Z	eobanb	tonyyarusso	this is what bios/bootloader passwords are for :)
2006-01-08T11:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	eobanb	And I do have that set.  Still a little bit taken aback though.
2006-01-08T11:33:00.000Z	eobanb	tonyyarusso	well it makes sense, doesnt it?
2006-01-08T11:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	eobanb	Well, I suppose.
2006-01-08T11:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	eobanb	You'd just have to mount the actual disk into the working live session and go from there then I suppose, right?
2006-01-08T11:33:00.000Z	eobanb	tonyyarusso	yeah, i'd imagine it involves chrooting a few times
2006-04-20T12:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	eobanb	But it keeps track of things smarter so it can remove metapackages.
2006-06-25T15:22:00.000Z	eobanb	tonyyarusso	the official policy was to recommend easyubuntu instead of automatix, but now it's pretty much just 'read the docs like you're supposed to instead of taking shortcuts'
2006-06-25T15:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	eobanb	Works for me.  (!automatix used to say that very, um, strongly.)
