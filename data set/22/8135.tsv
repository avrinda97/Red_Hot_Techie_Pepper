2006-06-03T05:18:00.000Z	woodwizzle		I have a HDD with ubuntu on it (breezy I think) and an HDD with WinXP. I have them both screwed into the computer but only the winXP one is plugged in. I want to make this PC dual boot. I believe the Ubuntu HDD has grub installed as well. Is there a good tutorial online that will guide me through setting up this systme?
2006-06-03T05:19:00.000Z	mustard5	woodwizzle	does your boot screen have a boot options choice like the f8 key which lists which device you want to boot from?
2006-06-03T05:20:00.000Z	woodwizzle	mustard5	i think it does when I have the ubuntu HDD plugged in
2006-06-03T05:20:00.000Z	woodwizzle		they are both set to primary atm and so I can only have one plugged in at a time
2006-06-03T05:21:00.000Z	mustard5	woodwizzle	yeah..I'm not talking about the GRUB menu, but just something related to your normal boot screen where you normally can choose to go to BIOS or whatever
2006-06-03T05:21:00.000Z	woodwizzle	mustard5	Oh, I dunno I never tried having them both plugged in at once to see
2006-06-03T05:21:00.000Z	mustard5	woodwizzle	they sometimes have another choice which is to show a menu of all the devices you can initially boot from and you can manually choose one
2006-06-03T05:23:00.000Z	mustard5	woodwizzle	you could use a grub floppy disk to boot to the second drive
2006-06-03T05:24:00.000Z	woodwizzle	mustard5	I guess I guess I'll try it and see... however I don't think tere is anything critical on the ubuntu drive data wise. Would it be easier to just hook up the drives correctly and then install dapper to the ubuntu drive
2006-06-03T05:24:00.000Z	mustard5	woodwizzle	you could even make the ubuntu drive the master and the XP drive the slave and boot from grub on the ubuntu drive (this will require some grub trickery to get XP to boot as a slave though)
2006-06-03T05:24:00.000Z	woodwizzle	mustard5	Thats kinda what I hoped to do
2006-06-03T05:25:00.000Z	woodwizzle	mustard5	since I thought making grub on the master inmportant
2006-06-03T05:25:00.000Z	woodwizzle		I can reinstall ubuntu no prob. I'd rather not re-install windows though
2006-06-03T05:26:00.000Z	mustard5	woodwizzle	I can't see why you need to reinstall at all
2006-06-03T05:26:00.000Z	woodwizzle		if it were easier =)
2006-06-03T05:26:00.000Z	mustard5	woodwizzle	you would just swap the jumpers around on the back of the drives to change which one is master and which one is slave
2006-06-03T05:27:00.000Z	mustard5	woodwizzle	there is a bit of a trick to getting windows to boot from a slave drive though..and you should familiarise yourself with that first probably
2006-06-03T05:29:00.000Z	woodwizzle	mustard5	can you enlighten me =) or show me a site that teaches me the trick
