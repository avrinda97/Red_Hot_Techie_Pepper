2007-01-12T15:32:00.000Z	Maric	DaneDog	you like fps type games then?
2007-01-12T15:35:00.000Z	Maric	DaneDog	stop by www.quadropolis.us
2007-01-12T15:40:00.000Z	Maric	DaneDog	yes, and due to my *limited* electronics training (avionics tech) I am inclined to dislike that statement
2007-01-12T15:41:00.000Z	Maric	DaneDog	no not really, and I am more inclined to think that there could be hardware damage if you are unlucky
2007-01-12T15:43:00.000Z	Maric	DaneDog	its not just heat, semiconductors like everything just so, if its off al kinds of wierd things happen
2007-01-12T15:44:00.000Z	Maric	DaneDog	votage, current and other things all can/do have their effects and when they are pushed too hard with anyof these smoke comes out
2007-01-12T15:47:00.000Z	Maric	DaneDog	they do punch out many chips at a time from the same silicon, but their tests are pretty accurate if conservative
2007-01-12T15:49:00.000Z	Maric	DaneDog	I got it by screwing up alot, graduated magna cum clod at the school of hard knocks
