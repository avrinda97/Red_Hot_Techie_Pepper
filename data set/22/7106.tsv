2007-10-05T14:10:00.000Z	clos		i installed vnc4server via 'apt-get install vnc4server' on a dedicated server that i'm renting, but when i go to IP:1 in my vnc viewer it can't find the server
2007-10-05T14:10:00.000Z	clos		any used vnc4server before?
2007-10-05T14:11:00.000Z	clos		did it work for you?
2007-10-05T14:11:00.000Z	clos		yeah
2007-10-05T14:11:00.000Z	clos		i did
2007-10-05T14:11:00.000Z	clos		'vnc4server'
2007-10-05T14:11:00.000Z	clos		and it asked me for a password
2007-10-05T14:12:00.000Z	clos		no
2007-10-05T14:12:00.000Z	MrObvious	clos	Oh wait I understand.
2007-10-05T14:11:00.000Z	MrObvious	clos	I've done VNC before.
2007-10-05T14:11:00.000Z	MrObvious	clos	Did you launch the server by vncserver first off?
2007-10-05T14:11:00.000Z	MrObvious	clos	Hmm. And it doesn't show you any desktop?
2007-10-05T14:12:00.000Z	MrObvious	clos	It asked for a pw to set up the server...right.
2007-10-05T14:12:00.000Z	MrObvious	clos	Sorry I need some afternoon caffeine. Are you trying to use a NAT router? You might have to do some port forwarding.
2007-10-05T14:14:00.000Z	MrObvious	clos	Oh I see.
2007-10-05T14:15:00.000Z	MrObvious	clos	So we'll assume there is no NAT router. Now we gotta look at the way it connects.
2007-10-05T14:15:00.000Z	MrObvious	clos	I'll assume the address you gave earlier is the IP address. Let me see if I can connect.
2007-10-05T14:16:00.000Z	MrObvious	clos	Try using plain vncserver and closing down vnc4server and see if that makes a difference.
2007-10-05T14:20:00.000Z	MrObvious	clos	Hmm. There might be a firewall between you and the remote server. Check and remove them if necessary.
2007-10-05T14:20:00.000Z	MrObvious	clos	Hmm. There is something obvious I'm missing. I'm sorry.
2007-10-05T14:21:00.000Z	MrObvious	clos	Hmm. I'll google a little bit to see if there is anything obvious I'm missing.
2007-10-05T14:30:00.000Z	MrObvious	clos	Hmm no idea. Sorry.
