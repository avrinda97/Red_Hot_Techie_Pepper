2008-06-27T02:35:00.000Z	RonLu2		I don't see videos in youtube... I do have flash plugin installed. what can be the problem?
2008-06-27T02:36:00.000Z	soundray	RonLu2	which flash plugin do you have?
2008-06-27T02:37:00.000Z	soundray	RonLu2	enter 'about:plugins' as the URL if you're not sure
2008-06-27T02:37:00.000Z	RonLu2	soundray	Shockwave Flash 9.0 r124
2008-06-27T02:38:00.000Z	soundray	RonLu2	is there any other relevant plugin, like gnash?
2008-06-27T02:39:00.000Z	RonLu2	soundray	maybe this one: Totem Web Browser Plugin 2.22.1 video/flv
2008-06-27T02:40:00.000Z	soundray	RonLu2	no, that one won't conflict
2008-06-27T02:40:00.000Z	RonLu2	soundray	so.... I just see grey screen in the place of the flash player in youtube
2008-06-27T02:42:00.000Z	soundray	RonLu2	I'm not sure what's wrong then. Have you restarted firefox?
2008-06-27T02:44:00.000Z	RonLu2	soundray	tried that already...
2008-06-27T02:47:00.000Z	soundray	RonLu2	are you on a 64bit system?
2008-06-27T02:49:00.000Z	RonLu2	soundray	yes......
2008-06-27T02:49:00.000Z	soundray	RonLu2	did you install flash from the Ubuntu repository?
2008-06-27T02:51:00.000Z	RonLu2	soundray	I installed it first when I went to youtube and it said I need to install plugins to make videos work.. I installed flash plugin and now it doesn't work :\
2008-06-27T02:52:00.000Z	soundray	RonLu2	uninstall the plugin with firefox, then exit firefox. Run 'sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree', then start firefox again.
2008-06-27T02:53:00.000Z	soundray	RonLu2	this procedure will adapt the 32bit plugin for your 64bit browser.
2008-06-27T02:57:00.000Z	soundray	RonLu2	how are you getting on?
2008-06-27T02:59:00.000Z	RonLu2	soundray	Working :) thanks...
2008-06-27T03:00:00.000Z	soundray	RonLu2	always use Ubuntu repos when you have a choice :)
2008-06-27T03:02:00.000Z	RonLu2	soundray	:) thanks. I was sure that the browser installs the same thing, as when I searched later for "flash" in synaptic the nonfree flash plugin was installed there.
2008-06-27T03:03:00.000Z	soundray	RonLu2	the secret is in the postinstall procedure. It uses nspluginwrapper to make the 32bit plugin usable in your 64bit environment
2008-06-27T03:27:00.000Z	RonLu2	soundray	and dimisdas: I checked already... it should work without problems
