2008-08-16T15:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sofisti1	what is your video device
2008-08-16T15:15:00.000Z	Sofisti1	IndyGunFreak	i have hp dv 6000 with ubuntu 8.04 and video driver could be Ge force 6000
2008-08-16T15:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sofisti1	what is your video device(your incessant begging apparently made you miss my question)
2008-08-16T15:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sofisti1	did you enable it in Hardware driver manager?
2008-08-16T15:17:00.000Z	Sofisti1	IndyGunFreak	in system? No i cannot view it on that
2008-08-16T15:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sofisti1	... where are you now?.. are you booting to a CLI or what?
2008-08-16T15:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sofisti1	its a simple question.. your english isn't that bad
2008-08-16T17:26:00.000Z	Sofisti1	IndyGunFreak	i tried to install driver of hiptobecubic and it is better but i don't resolve problem, have you any idea?
2008-08-16T17:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sofisti1	i don't even remember your problem
2008-08-16T17:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sofisti1	well, i don't know why you'd be having problems w/ it.. are you using 32bit or 64bit?
2008-08-16T17:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sofisti1	my experience w/ 64bit is less than positive... so no, i cant help you w/ that.. one reason i stick w/ 32bit for now, is for driver compatibility(but the nvidia driver should work fine)
2008-08-16T17:34:00.000Z	Sofisti1	IndyGunFreak	 i can use restricted but i didn't find in system-administration-driver
2008-08-16T17:37:00.000Z	Sofisti1	IndyGunFreak	you are very busy; none else can help me to solve this drivers problems?
2008-08-16T17:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sofisti1	its not that i'm busy, its just that you've made a mess of this, and its gonna be difficult to get working, why not just do a clean isntall of 32bit?
2008-08-16T17:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sofisti1	then you'll prefer to have problems... i've got a corvette, but i've never went 160mph
2008-08-16T17:40:00.000Z	Sofisti1	IndyGunFreak	it is a problem to reinstall all programs 32 bit it is very stressfull
2008-08-16T17:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sofisti1	32bit is far less stressful than 64bit.. but thats strictly opinion, but do what you want... i don't care
2008-08-16T17:45:00.000Z	Sofisti1	IndyGunFreak	ehehe it's right
2008-08-16T17:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sofisti1	the problem is, you're obviously doing everything wrong, so going back and fixing the mess, is difficult.
2008-08-16T17:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Sofisti1	well, you're obviously making a lot of progress now., so..lol
