2012-11-28T19:07:00.000Z	dsa		you guys know of any good app that backups/restores system state like a snapshot on a virtual machine?
2012-11-28T19:08:00.000Z	dsa		something that backs up/restores system settings, files and services
2012-11-28T19:10:00.000Z	dsa		yesterday i ruined somethings on my system.. made some bad installs/removes which led me to reinstall ubuntu
2012-11-28T19:10:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	learning experience(s)....
2012-11-28T19:12:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	 I find only the need to backup personal files.
2012-11-28T19:18:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	Just clone it.
2012-11-28T19:20:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	No, it's just an exact image of a drive.  You just put two identical drives in your system, clone to the slave. If anything happens to the primary drive, switch them.

2012-11-28T19:23:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	Cloning is the ultimate system restore option, IMO. It's much simplier.  It is a complete snapshot, personal files and all.
2012-11-28T19:23:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	Are you using vbox?
2012-11-28T19:24:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	I just keep /home/ on a separate partition.
2012-11-28T19:26:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	No it's not.  But what type of customized system state, services and settings to you have?
2012-11-28T19:27:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	... beyond default ones.
2012-11-28T19:28:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	If you did get some sort of system restore going for yourself, that would be about the time you'd learn enough not to hose your system anymore.  Linux is a bit simplier than you realize at first.
2012-11-28T19:29:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	We don't have the smoke and mirrors that MS Windows has, (like a registry file).
2012-11-28T19:32:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	Don't use webmin
2012-11-28T19:33:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	If you hose your system up, it is a learning experience, plain and simple.
2012-11-28T19:37:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	You can backup separate partitions or filesystems such as  /home/  or / or  /boot/
2012-11-28T19:38:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	The short answer is   "no"
2012-11-28T19:40:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	We do not have a "system restore" [AFIK] (comparable to what MS Windows has).  And yes, I know that you can get a Linux system into an un-reparable state (just like you can a MS Windows system).
2012-11-28T19:41:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	... BUT, doing a fresh install and leaving /home/  as is... well, that is a pretty good alternative.
2012-11-28T19:42:00.000Z	usr13_	dsa	See my PM.
