2010-06-29T02:52:00.000Z	ChrazRitt	Alanatiir	you have ati hardware?
2010-06-29T02:54:00.000Z	ChrazRitt	Alanatiir	are you working with a full hdd install of ubuntu for the amd cpu?
2010-06-29T02:54:00.000Z	Alanatiir	ChrazRitt	Yes, full install.
2010-06-29T02:55:00.000Z	ChrazRitt	Alanatiir	is your lappy hardware 64 bit?
2010-06-29T02:55:00.000Z	Alanatiir	ChrazRitt	The current one, who's link I posted, is 64-bit, and is using the 64-bit version of Ubuntu LTS.
2010-06-29T02:56:00.000Z	ChrazRitt	Alanatiir	did you get the updates for ubuntu?
2010-06-29T02:56:00.000Z	Alanatiir	ChrazRitt	Yes, Ubuntu is fully updated, according to the update manager.
2010-06-29T02:57:00.000Z	Alanatiir	ChrazRitt	There -are- no restricted drivers for this laptop, as far as Ubuntu is aware.
2010-06-29T02:59:00.000Z	ChrazRitt	Alanatiir	i have about the same chipset on my lappy, and i did find restricted drivers for mine, try the top bar over to the right, see if there are any odd looking icons there
2010-06-29T03:00:00.000Z	Alanatiir	ChrazRitt	No icons that I cannot ID
2010-06-29T03:00:00.000Z	ChrazRitt	Alanatiir	 try what sebsebseb suggests
2010-06-29T03:00:00.000Z	Alanatiir	ChrazRitt	Did, three times, no dice.
2010-06-29T03:01:00.000Z	Alanatiir	ChrazRitt	Doing it a fourth time, just to be thourough.
2010-06-29T03:01:00.000Z	Alanatiir	ChrazRitt	"No proprietary drivers are in use on this system." and the two windows beneath are empty.
2010-06-29T03:09:00.000Z	ChrazRitt	Alanatiir	the driver works for my machine
2010-06-29T03:14:00.000Z	ChrazRitt	Alanatiir	to tell the truth with the restricted drivers installed i don't see any difference, and that may be due to not being able to do much with my heating issues
2010-06-29T03:15:00.000Z	Alanatiir	ChrazRitt	Perhaps.  Though do you use Compiz or play in MMOs like I do?
2010-06-29T03:15:00.000Z	Alanatiir	ChrazRitt	If the fglrx for 10.04 supported my laptop, I'd use it in a heartbeat.
2010-06-29T03:16:00.000Z	Alanatiir	ChrazRitt	And you notice no difference between the two on your system?  Strange.
2010-06-29T03:18:00.000Z	ChrazRitt	Alanatiir	my problem seems to be thermal, i don't think ubuntu has control of the fan speed here
2010-06-29T03:19:00.000Z	Alanatiir	ChrazRitt	And my problem is software.
2010-06-29T03:22:00.000Z	ChrazRitt	Alanatiir	what i meant is that i don't have any graphics problem, but that i might not see one because i have the thermal issue that might be blocking me from fully using my graphics card
