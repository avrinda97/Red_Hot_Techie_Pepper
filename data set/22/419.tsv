2011-10-15T14:06:00.000Z	kennyken		do we have VDPAU support for all relevant applications in Oneiric Ocelot?
2011-10-15T14:07:00.000Z	reisio	kennyken	mplayer does
2011-10-15T14:08:00.000Z	kennyken	reisio	have you tried playing 1080p content and watched the cpu load?
2011-10-15T14:09:00.000Z	reisio	kennyken	no, but you will notice the improvement
2011-10-15T14:09:00.000Z	kennyken	reisio	thanks for this information
2011-10-15T14:11:00.000Z	reisio	kennyken	don't know if you still have to do this or not: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/BluRayAndHDDVD#Playback_using_VDPAU_acceleration
2011-10-15T14:14:00.000Z	reisio	kennyken	downer
2011-10-15T14:15:00.000Z	kennyken	reisio	not really, as there were special dependencies neccessary which weren't available for this ubuntu version
2011-10-15T14:16:00.000Z	reisio	kennyken	hrmm?
2011-10-15T14:16:00.000Z	kennyken	reisio	that is a little too much effort, dont you think?
2011-10-15T14:17:00.000Z	reisio	kennyken	gotcha
2011-10-15T14:17:00.000Z	reisio	kennyken	in Gentoo it's just emerge -DNatuv world, done :p
2011-10-15T14:18:00.000Z	kennyken	reisio	same with freeBSD, which i normally use, but since it lags multimedia functionality massively i switched to ubuntu
2011-10-15T14:19:00.000Z	reisio	kennyken	maybe time for Gentoo then :p
2011-10-15T14:20:00.000Z	kennyken	reisio	are there repositorys for already compiled binary packages in gentoo?
2011-10-15T14:20:00.000Z	kennyken	reisio	i would only compile if theres is a need to (needing special options in a package or something)
2011-10-15T14:20:00.000Z	reisio	kennyken	yeah but they tend to be few and far between, outside of the important ones at tinderbox
2011-10-15T14:21:00.000Z	reisio	kennyken	there's Sabayon's binaries, but I wouldn't really trust those
2011-10-15T14:22:00.000Z	kennyken	reisio	then i wouldnt want to go with gentoo, thats the big advantage with freeBSD, you have everything binary directly coming from the freeBSD package maintainers (trusted), and if you like to, you can just compile everything but you dont have to
2011-10-15T14:22:00.000Z	reisio	kennyken	yeah, but with that whole lagging behind thing, apparently :p
2011-10-15T14:24:00.000Z	reisio	kennyken	it is for things like vdpau, but that doesn't involve 'everything' indeed
2011-10-15T14:24:00.000Z	kennyken	reisio	yes
