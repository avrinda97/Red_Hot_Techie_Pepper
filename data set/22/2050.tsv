2009-10-14T05:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Germanacho	Are you using ext4?
2009-10-14T05:08:00.000Z	Germanacho	Jordan_U	why did you asked me if I were using ext4
2009-10-14T05:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Germanacho	First thing I would do is boot into a liveCD and make sure that you backup any files that are important to you, and don't force shutdown your computer even if it seems completely frozen
2009-10-14T05:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Germanacho	ext4 Has a bug where files can be lost if the computer looses power ( though that may not be what is happening to you, it's not common and luckily almost never affects user's data, just configuration files )
2009-10-14T05:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Germanacho	By reinstalling all of the packages whose files are zero bytes, but it could also be a bad drive or some other problem entirely so you should back up any important data now
2009-10-14T05:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Germanacho	I would do an fsck and try to figure out what went wrong, if it's a bad drive you might want to get rid of it
2009-10-14T05:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Germanacho	Also try memtest
2009-10-14T05:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Germanacho	You will need to boot into recovery mode or a liveCD to run fsck
2009-10-14T05:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Germanacho	np :)
2009-10-14T05:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Germanacho	I just guessed possible problems, don't count on my guesses being right :)
2009-10-14T05:18:00.000Z	Germanacho	Jordan_U	if I have to reinstall my system, do you reccomend me the 9.10 beta ?
2009-10-14T05:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Germanacho	No, not because of anything specific but just because it's still beta
