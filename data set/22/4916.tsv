2007-11-25T03:08:00.000Z	Sajes		Anyone know why I received this error when compiling WINE from source? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/45730/ (Gutsy Gibbon 32Bit)
2007-11-25T03:08:00.000Z	zeroflag	Sajes	get the package.
2007-11-25T03:09:00.000Z	Sajes	zeroflag	Which one? I did "sudo apt-cache search opengl" and many came up. I downloaded a few and still nothing different.
2007-11-25T03:11:00.000Z	zeroflag	Sajes	talking about the wine package. if that error doesn't tell you anything, you better not mess with source. OpenGL is usually delivered via VGA drivers. so if you have a nvidia card, get their package from restricted (I think it's uni/multiverse), if it's ATi, you might be screwed but you should still be able to find a driver package.
2007-11-25T03:11:00.000Z	Sajes	zeroflag	I downloaded and installed the nvidia drivers first thing after installing gutsy.
2007-11-25T03:13:00.000Z	zeroflag	Sajes	bash -> glxgears
2007-11-25T03:14:00.000Z	Sajes	zeroflag	it pops up with gears and gives me a line of "4351 frames in 5.0 seconds = 870.168".
2007-11-25T03:14:00.000Z	zeroflag	Sajes	that means opengl is installed.
2007-11-25T03:14:00.000Z	zeroflag	Sajes	honestly, get the wine package.
2007-11-25T03:15:00.000Z	Sajes	zeroflag	I already tried that before, and it installs but it plays starcraft like it was on emulated vram. If it can't find opengl then it has to be why it's lagging even with the .deb package.
2007-11-25T03:16:00.000Z	zeroflag	Sajes	I use nvidia drivers and wine from apt and starcraft runs just fine.
2007-11-25T03:17:00.000Z	Sajes	zeroflag	Then consider myself unlucky. I tried the WINE from the repositories and it did the same thing.
2007-11-25T03:19:00.000Z	zeroflag	Sajes	starcraft is a really old game that already worked nicely back when broodwar came out. so unless you have REALLY old hardware, I'd say something else than wine is wrong.
2007-11-25T03:19:00.000Z	Sajes	zeroflag	I'm on an nvidia geforce fx5500 128mb. It's really old, but not commodore 64 old.
2007-11-25T03:21:00.000Z	zeroflag	Sajes	this should be more than enough - especially since starcraft does NOT use ANY 3D features. you should check the appdb on winehq.
2007-11-25T03:21:00.000Z	Sajes	zeroflag	I've played SC and brood war on WinXp. They run fine; But I don't want to have to reboot every time I want to play it.
2007-11-25T03:23:00.000Z	zeroflag	Sajes	again, check the appdb. I got it working nicely here, straight from apt.
2007-11-25T03:24:00.000Z	Sajes	zeroflag	I know it runs in wine. Checking the appdb will not make wine detect that opengl libraries are on my PC.
2007-11-25T03:26:00.000Z	zeroflag	Sajes	since I had to check the appdb for you AND find EXACTLY your problem described there in a HUGE, impossible-to-miss blue box, I will NOT post the link for you - lazy &^#&^@!
2007-11-25T03:27:00.000Z	Sajes	zeroflag	It doesn't happen with just starcraft, and now I will stop asking you questions, seeing as you're being impossible to talk to. Goodbye.
2007-11-25T03:32:00.000Z	Sajes	zeroflag	If you're talking about "Cure for Slowness", then obviously you've completely mistook the problem. Let me walk you through this. Wine can't find opengl libraries. I can't edit a registry if there isn't one. If I can't compile wine, how would it install. Furthermore, the debian package, and the apt repository have the same problem on my machine.
2007-11-25T03:34:00.000Z	Sajes	zeroflag	But, I have been able to successfully play "AssaultCube" at great rates. The problem lies with wine.
