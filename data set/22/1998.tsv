2011-01-24T17:24:00.000Z	erry		um, I have a greek keyboard layout where ; should wait for me to type a letter and put a ´ on top but instead it outputs ´?
2011-01-24T17:25:00.000Z	erry		.-.
2011-01-24T17:25:00.000Z	erry		I need to be able to press ; and α and get a α with a ´ on it
2011-01-24T17:25:00.000Z	erry		And most of those aren't greek
2011-01-24T17:25:00.000Z	erry		we only have ´
2011-01-24T17:26:00.000Z	erry		It used to work that way but now it only gives me '
2011-01-24T17:26:00.000Z	erry		´ i mean
2011-01-24T17:26:00.000Z	erry		.-.
2011-01-24T17:26:00.000Z	erry		You're missing the point
2011-01-24T17:26:00.000Z	quiescens	erry	most of that stuff should be in preferences, keyboard, layouts
2011-01-24T17:26:00.000Z	erry	quiescens	no its not there
2011-01-24T17:31:00.000Z	quiescens	erry	as far as I can tell, preferences, keyboard, layouts, add, greece. and then either use the button on your panel to toggle layouts, or remove the old layout and log out and back in
2011-01-24T17:32:00.000Z	erry	quiescens	i have the greek layout
2011-01-24T17:32:00.000Z	erry		that's not the rpoblem
2011-01-24T17:33:00.000Z	erry		the ; button in that layout should wait for me to press another letter and then insert a stress mark
2011-01-24T17:33:00.000Z	erry		On the letter
2011-01-24T17:33:00.000Z	erry		but it doesn't
2011-01-24T17:33:00.000Z	quiescens	erry	which release are you on?
2011-01-24T17:34:00.000Z	erry	quiescens	ubuntu 10.04
2011-01-24T17:34:00.000Z	erry	quiescens	i think it used to work. Maybe installing SCIM messed it up.
2011-01-24T17:34:00.000Z	quiescens	erry	appears to work for me
2011-01-24T17:34:00.000Z	quiescens	erry	possibly
