2008-05-25T09:12:00.000Z	Kohlrak		looks like i'm gonna have to boot up windows, wine wont' even use the software on the dvd
2008-05-25T09:12:00.000Z	james__	Kohlrak	what app ya trying to run?
2008-05-25T09:12:00.000Z	james__	Kohlrak	what version of wine do you have?
2008-05-25T09:12:00.000Z	Kohlrak	james__	not an app, actually, a DVD
2008-05-25T09:13:00.000Z	Kohlrak		and the most recent version of wine
2008-05-25T09:13:00.000Z	james__	Kohlrak	Video DVD?
2008-05-25T09:13:00.000Z	Kohlrak		there is software on the dvd, so i'm assuming the app might provide some sort of decryptor
2008-05-25T09:13:00.000Z	Kohlrak		and yes, video dvd
2008-05-25T09:14:00.000Z	james__	Kohlrak	 is it embedded Video software or actual windows software?
2008-05-25T09:14:00.000Z	Kohlrak		Xfiles - Season 4
2008-05-25T09:14:00.000Z	Kohlrak		it's actual windows software
2008-05-25T09:15:00.000Z	Kohlrak		Then what's totem's problem that it's chokin' on it?
2008-05-25T09:15:00.000Z	james__	Kohlrak	it might be that the software itself has runtime DRM attached
2008-05-25T09:15:00.000Z	Kohlrak		the DRM is beyond annoying.......................
2008-05-25T09:16:00.000Z	Kohlrak		i'm trying that now
2008-05-25T09:16:00.000Z	Kohlrak		ton of vobs, sorting through them now
2008-05-25T09:17:00.000Z	james__	Kohlrak	I once had audio files from musicmatch that used runtime DRM to tell me I didn't have licenses that I've purchased, and other time it would tell me that I don't have the correct player.
2008-05-25T09:17:00.000Z	james__	Kohlrak	it sucked
2008-05-25T09:17:00.000Z	Kohlrak		i'm sick of the DRM stuff.
2008-05-25T09:18:00.000Z	Kohlrak		it's just more stuff to force us to microsoft, they're not really worried about us or the people who make the dvds
2008-05-25T09:18:00.000Z	Kohlrak		Microsoft is just using them to control us
2008-05-25T09:18:00.000Z	james__	Kohlrak	DRM, good Idea, poor implementation
