2008-02-15T23:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	lgc	can you paste a sample line you want to match
2008-02-15T23:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	lgc	worked for me
2008-02-15T23:38:00.000Z	lgc	prince_jammys	I mean you, be my guest: '1        12.0290         -8.5444         12.8800          1.3126        14'. These are the patterns I want to catch.
2008-02-15T23:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	lgc	grep -e '^1.*14$'
2008-02-15T23:38:00.000Z	lgc	prince_jammys	it needs the space after "1",
2008-02-15T23:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	lgc	followed by the filename
2008-02-15T23:39:00.000Z	prince_jammys	lgc	grep -e '^1 .*14$'  matches the line you pasted
2008-02-15T23:39:00.000Z	prince_jammys	lgc	space after 1
2008-02-15T23:40:00.000Z	lgc	prince_jammys	'grep -e '^1 .*14$' ' produces no output on my term.
2008-02-15T23:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	lgc	followed by the filename?
2008-02-15T23:40:00.000Z	lgc	prince_jammys	of course.
2008-02-15T23:41:00.000Z	prince_jammys	lgc	mmm i just pasted it in stdin and it showed a match, not sure whats up
2008-02-15T23:42:00.000Z	lgc	prince_jammys	would it have to do with globbing, perhaps?
2008-02-15T23:44:00.000Z	prince_jammys	lgc	created a file with that line in it, ran the grep and it matched --- so i dont know whats going on
2008-02-15T23:44:00.000Z	lgc	prince_jammys	hmm... I'm puzzled...
2008-02-15T23:44:00.000Z	prince_jammys	lgc	a GNU grep issue vs other grep??  i really dont know
2008-02-15T23:45:00.000Z	lgc	prince_jammys	since we're both on Ubuntu with default term options -I suppose- that shoudn't be an issue.
2008-02-15T23:46:00.000Z	prince_jammys	lgc	any special chars in the filename?
2008-02-15T23:46:00.000Z	lgc	prince_jammys	nope. 'movies.loc'.
2008-02-15T23:47:00.000Z	prince_jammys	lgc	the folks at #bash can deal with this well
2008-02-15T23:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	lgc	its grep city over there, they should be able to fix this
2008-02-15T23:48:00.000Z	lgc	prince_jammys	good idea. Let me try luck there.
