2006-07-20T15:48:00.000Z	Khamael		is there any graphic nes emulators for ubuntu?
2006-07-20T15:48:00.000Z	Warbo	Khamael	Could you WINE Nesticle or someting?
2006-08-15T15:08:00.000Z	Warbo	Khamael	Yes, but it may take a little extra work
2006-08-15T15:08:00.000Z	Khamael	Warbo	so it is still work to be done to make it work for "joe user"
2006-08-15T15:09:00.000Z	Warbo	Khamael	I don't know, I think they work fine, it's just that specific x86 stuff is not in Synaptic's x86_64 repositories, so they must be downloaded an installed manually (in fact, the same way as Windows users do. And people say that is perfect for "joe user")
2006-08-15T15:12:00.000Z	Warbo	Khamael	It probably isn't noticable in day to day use
2006-08-15T15:14:00.000Z	Warbo	Khamael	Take a look on help.ubuntu.com/community and see if you think it's worth it
2006-08-15T15:17:00.000Z	Warbo	Khamael	32bit/64bit systems should be seamless by Edgy+1 I think
2006-08-15T15:37:00.000Z	Warbo	Khamael	Wine will not build for 64bit, but linux32 should run 32bit Wine (eff-all Windows programs are 64bit, so there is no point making Wine 64bit)
2006-08-17T13:06:00.000Z	Warbo	Khamael	Swiftfox is Firefox with "social bookmarking" (one of those new buzz words)
2006-09-24T14:25:00.000Z	Warbo	Khamael	AiGLX depends on a certain feature that some proprietary graphics card drivers don't use (I think only ATI at the moment), but XGL will work on any driver (just not as well as AiGLX)
2006-09-24T14:26:00.000Z	Khamael	Warbo	so AIGLX is better?
2006-09-24T14:26:00.000Z	Warbo	Khamael	I think so
2006-09-24T14:26:00.000Z	Warbo	Khamael	It only realy works well with Free 3D drivers though (and there aren't many of those)
2006-09-24T14:27:00.000Z	Khamael	Warbo	heard that nvidia now supports AIGLX
2006-09-26T06:45:00.000Z	Warbo	Khamael	I think some have been made, but the command line options have changed round a bit recently
2006-09-26T06:45:00.000Z	Khamael	Warbo	worth a try.. is it in any ubuntu repo?
2006-09-26T06:46:00.000Z	Warbo	Khamael	None in Ubuntu
2006-09-26T06:49:00.000Z	Khamael	Warbo	found qemu-launcher, but it says it needs qemu. but I have qemu
2006-09-26T06:50:00.000Z	Warbo	Khamael	Yeah, I think I have a package of that. I don't know how I installed it (since I comnpiled my own qemu), I think maybe extracting it, changing the dependencies then repackaging it might work
2006-09-26T06:51:00.000Z	Khamael	Warbo	think I`ll settle for a nice howto  ;-)
2006-09-26T06:52:00.000Z	Warbo	Khamael	All I remember is -hda for HD, -cdrom for CD (or use -hdc), -fda for floppy, -boot X to boot from device X in MSDOS style (a, c or d), and occasionally -soundhw sb16 (I think) for sound
