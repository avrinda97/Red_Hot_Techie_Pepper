2009-05-06T03:28:00.000Z	glitsj16	MikeTheC	i think you need libcanberra0 to be able to play system event sounds
2009-05-06T03:30:00.000Z	MikeTheC	glitsj16	Just checked, and it is installed. I wasn't able to get assigned sounds to play in 8.04 or 8.10, either. It's just kind of silly to have the feature but not be able to get it to work.
2009-05-06T03:30:00.000Z	MikeTheC	glitsj16	Also, I earlier asked about automatic changing/cycling of wallpaper. Any thoughts? Compiz' Wallpaper module does nothing, and Wallpaper Tray doesn't seem to be able to install correctly on 9.04.
2009-05-06T03:32:00.000Z	glitsj16	MikeTheC	true, for me they started to work and i don't use them ... things are always weirdly distributed (you might need additional libcanberra related packages, i have 3 but am on xubuntu so i couldn't be sure)
2009-05-06T03:32:00.000Z	glitsj16	MikeTheC	i remember the cycling wallpaper question yes, compiz wallpaper works fine, but it doesn't do cycling
2009-05-06T03:33:00.000Z	MikeTheC	glitsj16	aw nuts. I used to use Wallpaper Tray in 8.04 and 8.10.
2009-05-06T03:33:00.000Z	glitsj16	MikeTheC	any errors using wallpaper tray ? or why do you think it didn't install properly ?
2009-05-06T03:34:00.000Z	MikeTheC	glitsj16	It installs with no errors but it cannot be found. Even when I do a "which wallpaper-tray" or "which wp-tray" nothing is returned.
2009-05-06T03:35:00.000Z	glitsj16	MikeTheC	you need to manually update the database if you want to find/locate something after an install, try "sudo updatedb", let it do its voodoo and run a "locate wp-tray" afterwards
2009-05-06T03:37:00.000Z	MikeTheC	glitsj16	Well, yeah, it finds the directories and stuff, but no actual app itself.
2009-05-06T03:38:00.000Z	glitsj16	MikeTheC	odd indeed ... just looking at the homepage of wallpaper-tray and it mentions availability of older versions that still use the notification area instead of the gnome panel, perhaps a job for manual compilation
2009-05-06T03:45:00.000Z	MikeTheC	glitsj16	Ok, got it working. That's weird. Oh well, they changed how it works. C 'est la vie, I guess... Thanks again!
2009-05-06T03:46:00.000Z	glitsj16	MikeTheC	:) happy cycling
2009-05-06T03:47:00.000Z	MikeTheC	glitsj16	Now if only I could figure out what's up with sound events in Gnome. *sigh*
2009-05-06T03:48:00.000Z	glitsj16	MikeTheC	have you tried installing some extra libcanberra related packages yet ?
2009-05-06T03:52:00.000Z	MikeTheC	glitsj16	The only uninstalled options are libcanberra0-dbg, libcanberra-dev, libcanberra-doc, libcanberra-gtk0-dbg, libcanberra-gtk-dev and libcanberra-gtk-module-dbg.
2009-05-06T03:52:00.000Z	glitsj16	MikeTheC	that looks like you have all you should need from libcanberra, those are either debug or dev packages indeed
2009-05-06T03:53:00.000Z	MikeTheC	glitsj16	Yup, pretty much. Mind you I did a search for just "canberra" to try and catch anything that could be relevant or related.
2009-05-06T03:54:00.000Z	glitsj16	MikeTheC	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libcanberra/+bug/273507 might have a fix
2009-05-06T04:02:00.000Z	MikeTheC	glitsj16	Hmm... Went through that, but I cannot do the "gconftool-2 --install-schema-file=libcanberra.schemas". It just tells me there is no such file or directory. That being said, they did cite the Trash thing as something not yet implemented so maybe that's still the case under Jaunty.
2009-05-06T04:03:00.000Z	MikeTheC	glitsj16	Anyhow, it's alright. Nothing I'm going to lose sleep over. Thanks again for your help!
2009-05-06T04:04:00.000Z	glitsj16	MikeTheC	yes i didn't see much jaunty users on that bugpage true, no problem, have a nice time
