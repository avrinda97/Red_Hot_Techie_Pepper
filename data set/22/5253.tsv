2007-06-10T11:06:00.000Z	Shankysv87		i'm looking for help with how to use beryl
2007-06-10T11:07:00.000Z	Shankysv87		i'm very new to linux and ubuntu

2007-06-10T11:07:00.000Z	Shankysv87		and i'm not sure how to get anything from beryl to work
2007-06-10T11:08:00.000Z	shijirou	Shankysv87	 have you installed beryl already?
2007-06-10T11:08:00.000Z	Shankysv87		yesa
2007-06-10T11:08:00.000Z	Shankysv87		yes
2007-06-10T11:09:00.000Z	Shankysv87		the Beryl Manager, Beryl settings manager, and Beryl Settings Manager (simple)
2007-06-10T11:09:00.000Z	shijirou	Shankysv87	open up terminal and type "beryl-manager"
2007-06-10T11:10:00.000Z	Shankysv87	shijirou	ok, now what?
2007-06-10T11:11:00.000Z	shijirou	Shankysv87	there's a gem icon... on the upper right? tell you what... its better to read thru the beryl wiki than spoon feed you everything... => http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Main_Page
2007-06-10T11:12:00.000Z	Shankysv87		i've read the wiki.. but i wasn't able to find where it tells how to get it going...
2007-06-10T11:12:00.000Z	shijirou		?
2007-06-10T11:12:00.000Z	Shankysv87		skimmed it anyway
2007-06-10T11:12:00.000Z	shijirou		what is it exactly you are trying to do with beryl?
2007-06-10T11:12:00.000Z	Shankysv87		maybe i'm reading the wrong wiki lol
2007-06-10T11:12:00.000Z	Shankysv87		what is the wiki address?
2007-06-10T11:13:00.000Z	Shankysv87		i'm trying just pretty much anything
2007-06-10T11:13:00.000Z	Shankysv87		i'm trying to find out what it can do
2007-06-10T11:13:00.000Z	shijirou	Shankysv87	i posted the wiki... scroll up
2007-06-10T11:13:00.000Z	Shankysv87		ok thanks
2007-06-10T11:17:00.000Z	Shankysv87	shijirou	i guess i still don't understand.. where on the site does it show you a tutorial for a beginner
