2011-07-21T11:32:00.000Z	obert		a separate server machine would be faster anyway
2011-07-21T11:33:00.000Z	obert		you need a lot of ram if you get some OSes
2011-07-21T11:35:00.000Z	wols_	obert	how does a VM help playing games?
2011-07-21T11:45:00.000Z	wols_	obert	you can. linux will use it fine. windows not
2011-07-21T11:46:00.000Z	obert	wols_	how? i doubt i have internet connection in that machine. i got an usb pen drive with mini.iso but i cannot boot from there. also if i try to mount or mini.iso or gparted.iso it just try to open it via archive manager.
2011-07-21T11:47:00.000Z	wols_	obert	what is your actual problem?
2011-07-21T11:47:00.000Z	obert	wols_	i want to format a hd :)
2011-07-21T11:48:00.000Z	wols_	obert	and you have what OS to access said hdd right now?
2011-07-21T11:49:00.000Z	obert	wols_	not sure if i'm ina loop. i got a hd with ubuntu 6,i want to format it
2011-07-21T11:50:00.000Z	wols_	obert	again: what OS do you have right now that accesses this HDD?
2011-07-21T11:50:00.000Z	obert	wols_	ubuntu 6
2011-07-21T11:50:00.000Z	wols_	obert	and why do you need to format it?
2011-07-21T11:50:00.000Z	obert	wols_	it is obsolete
2011-07-21T11:51:00.000Z	wols_	obert	gparted is not needed for what you want to do. mkfs is
2011-07-21T11:51:00.000Z	obert	wols_	why i dont need to format the hd if i want to install mini.iso?
2011-07-21T11:52:00.000Z	wols_	obert	no. the installer, like any other oeprating system installer, can format before it installs. partition too
2011-07-21T11:52:00.000Z	obert	wols_	but i cannot boot from usb pen drive
2011-07-21T11:53:00.000Z	wols_	obert	how can you boot then?
2011-07-21T11:53:00.000Z	obert	wols_	no idea :P
2011-07-21T11:54:00.000Z	obert	wols_	i just read that i cannot boot from usb,also if i try to do it, it'll boot the ubuntu 6 instead,ever
2011-07-21T11:54:00.000Z	wols_	obert	you can use debootstrap by running it via your ubuntu6 installation. but this is not trivial
2011-07-21T11:55:00.000Z	obert	wols_	i think i need to study something better. i'm very confused at this moment. thanks though
