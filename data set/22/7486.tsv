2006-11-27T16:33:00.000Z	eepberries		alright the error log file is still saying the error "could not open default font 'fixed'"
2006-11-27T16:33:00.000Z	eepberries		uh, is this really a problem?
2006-11-27T16:34:00.000Z	eepberries		it's also saying "error opening security policy file /etc/X11/xserver/SecurityPolicy"
2006-11-27T12:07:00.000Z	eepberries		how can i see the mounted devices in terminal mode?
2006-11-27T12:08:00.000Z	stalefries	eepberries	you can check your /media folder, also /etc/fstab is a useful file to look at
2006-11-27T12:09:00.000Z	stalefries	eepberries	supposedly, ubuntu should do it autmoatically
2006-11-27T12:09:00.000Z	stalefries	eepberries	x or no x, yes :)
2006-11-27T12:10:00.000Z	stalefries	eepberries	try man mount
2006-11-27T12:10:00.000Z	stalefries	eepberries	but check if it's mounted first
2006-11-27T12:11:00.000Z	stalefries	eepberries	cd /media
2006-11-27T12:11:00.000Z	stalefries	eepberries	hmm, look at /etc/fstab
2006-11-27T12:11:00.000Z	stalefries	eepberries	it may give you some hints
2006-11-27T12:14:00.000Z	eepberries	stalefries	/etc/fstab just says command not found
2006-11-27T12:14:00.000Z	stalefries	eepberries	that's a file, do nane /etc/fstab
2006-11-27T12:14:00.000Z	eepberries	stalefries	nane: command not found
2006-11-27T12:17:00.000Z	eepberries	stalefries	nane: command not found
2006-11-27T12:17:00.000Z	stalefries	eepberries	did I write nane? I meant nano
2006-11-27T12:18:00.000Z	stalefries	eepberries	I've been pretty busy :)
