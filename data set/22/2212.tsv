2009-08-21T02:21:00.000Z	mscyber07		hey, can anyone tell me which driver goes with my hard drive?
2009-08-21T02:21:00.000Z	mscyber07		I have a Dell Latitude XT.
2009-08-21T02:23:00.000Z	mscyber07		can anyone tell me which driver goes with my hard drive?
2009-08-21T02:23:00.000Z	mscyber07		I have a Samsung Model HS 122JC
2009-08-21T02:24:00.000Z	DasEi	mscyber07	harddrives are usually found by hal, any special device ?
2009-08-21T02:24:00.000Z	mscyber07		Ubuntu 9.04 (the text version) recognizes that there's one present, and
2009-08-21T02:24:00.000Z	mscyber07		gives me a list to choose from.
2009-08-21T02:25:00.000Z	DasEi	mscyber07	so it's detected
2009-08-21T02:25:00.000Z	mscyber07		what's hal?  ...yes.
2009-08-21T02:25:00.000Z	mscyber07		it detects it, then asks which driver suits it.
2009-08-21T02:25:00.000Z	mscyber07		I don't know, and I'm not sure where to go to find out.
2009-08-21T02:25:00.000Z	DasEi		!who | mscyber07 ; hardware abstraction layer
2009-08-21T02:26:00.000Z	DasEi	mscyber07	where do you hang then ?
2009-08-21T02:26:00.000Z	mscyber07		!DasEi what do you mean where do I hang?
2009-08-21T02:27:00.000Z	DasEi	mscyber07	you asked for a driver for your hardware, though ubuntu's kernel seems to fit it (the "!") triggers the channel ro-bot
2009-08-21T02:28:00.000Z	mscyber07	DasEi	the kernel fits, I'm just not sure WHICH driver goes with my hardware.
2009-08-21T02:29:00.000Z	mscyber07	DasEi	I don't want to screw it up by giving it the wrong one.
2009-08-21T02:29:00.000Z	DasEi	mscyber07	you can't, you can choose partitoning at install, not kernelbehavior
2009-08-21T02:30:00.000Z	mscyber07	DasEi	I've got the install going right now.  Would you like to private chat and walk me thru it?
2009-08-21T02:31:00.000Z	DasEi	mscyber07	I won't stay up long (up since more then 35 h), why private, it's common sense here

2009-08-21T02:34:00.000Z	mscyber07	DasEi	thanks, I'll give it a try.
