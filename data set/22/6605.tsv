2006-10-05T06:10:00.000Z	feross	jester45	install hplip
2006-10-05T06:11:00.000Z	jester45	feross	i dont see it in the repos do i have to get it from the web?
2006-10-05T06:12:00.000Z	feross	jester45	hmm looks like it's in main should be there
2006-10-05T06:17:00.000Z	jester45	feross	what about hp-ppd
2006-10-05T06:17:00.000Z	feross	jester45	not sure.. what does man hp-ppd say?
2006-10-05T06:19:00.000Z	feross	jester45	it might be e depend to hplip but it probably won't work on it's own. Weird that you can't get hplip, no xfce interface for it? I use gnome so I wouldn't know, you'll have to do some research on that and if necessary download and install hplip manually.
2006-10-05T06:20:00.000Z	jester45	feross	think this could work? libprinterconf0c2a - Printer autodetection library
2006-10-05T06:21:00.000Z	feross	jester45	nah, same as hp-ppd
2006-10-05T06:22:00.000Z	feross	jester45	usually hplip is installed by default. I know I've had to turn off the service just so it's not sucking up cpu cycles in the background. I don't havy any printer setup on the lappy I'm on. Also turned off cups.
2006-10-05T06:22:00.000Z	jester45	feross	they have things for the officejet and lasrjet but not deskjet :(
