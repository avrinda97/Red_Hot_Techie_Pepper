2006-02-21T08:32:00.000Z	mzuverink		Why does Open Office 2 not sorrect spelling, do I need to install dictionaries myself?
2006-02-21T08:32:00.000Z	farous	mzuverink	look at writing aids and select your lang then make sure autocorrect is on
2006-02-21T08:33:00.000Z	farous		there is a macro file for installing dic if you need them DicOOo-1.5.5.sxw
2006-02-21T08:34:00.000Z	mzuverink	farous	that did not work
2006-02-21T08:34:00.000Z	farous	mzuverink	which language you need
2006-02-21T08:35:00.000Z	mzuverink		US English
2006-02-21T08:35:00.000Z	farous		installed by default
2006-02-21T08:35:00.000Z	mzuverink		farous:us english
2006-02-21T08:35:00.000Z	farous		tools>options>writing aids> then set your language and dict there
2006-02-21T08:39:00.000Z	mzuverink		Farous: thats what I figured, but it is not working either in autocorrecct or when I manually run spell check, I installed everything properly
2006-02-21T08:39:00.000Z	farous	mzuverink	hmm do you have myspell installed that is what openoffice uses for spellcheck
2006-02-21T08:39:00.000Z	farous		and i think it is not installed by default on ubuntu
2006-02-21T08:40:00.000Z	mzuverink	farous	I will check
2006-02-21T08:41:00.000Z	mzuverink	farous	that was not installed, installing it now, hopefully that will solve the problem
2006-02-21T08:41:00.000Z	farous	mzuverink	i will be here for couple of min so keep me posted
2006-02-21T08:41:00.000Z	farous	mzuverink	check if you have the thesuars too
2006-02-21T08:42:00.000Z	mzuverink	farous	that worked, you would think that that would be a dependency
2006-02-21T08:42:00.000Z	farous		ya starange heh. I tried running it with aspell but did not work
2006-02-21T08:43:00.000Z	farous		run-with-aspell oowriter2 but i had to install myspell at the end
2006-02-21T08:43:00.000Z	mzuverink	farous	whats the thesuars package named?
2006-02-21T08:44:00.000Z	farous	mzuverink	go to open office websit and download this file a macro file for installing dic if you need them DicOOo-1.5.5.sxw. It is not installed by default either and will take care of all dic and thesua for you
