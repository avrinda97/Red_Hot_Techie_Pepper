2009-12-26T01:03:00.000Z	elzoog	adminewb1	 In old grub, all I would have to do is edit the line in the menu.lst file.   Since you say grub2 is more user friendly, there should be a simpler way to do that in grub2
2009-12-26T01:04:00.000Z	adminewb1	elzoog	you can edit grub.cfg also, but with the understanding that your customizing can be clobbered next time an autoupdate sets up a new kernel, for instance
2009-12-26T01:06:00.000Z	elzoog	adminewb1	 That's another point.  If they wanted to make grub2 MORE user friendly and not LESS user friendly, then why didn't they give the option of automatically replacing old kernel entries in the menu with new ones?
2009-12-26T01:07:00.000Z	adminewb1	elzoog	not sure I understand; I thought it did just that
2009-12-26T01:09:00.000Z	elzoog	adminewb1	 In other words, instead of displaying to the user "Ubuntu, Linux generic 2.12.123123    Ubuntu, Linux generic 2.13.1232"  call it "Ubuntu Netbook Remix" then when the kernel is updated, have "Ubuntu Netbook Remix" point to the generic 2.13.1232 kernel instead of the 2.12.123123 kernel.
2009-12-26T01:10:00.000Z	elzoog	adminewb1	In other words INTERNALLY, keep the name of the kernel whatever user unfriendly name you want to call it.   But simply change the TEXT that is displayed in the menu
2009-12-26T01:10:00.000Z	adminewb1	elzoog	ok, if you're going to customize the text of the menu entries, it would be up to you to save a backup and hand-edit to clean up after autoupdates; I realize this is not a terribly satisfying answer
2009-12-26T01:11:00.000Z	adminewb1	elzoog	right, I wouldn't really recommend changing the file names of your kernels; you might add some handy symbolic links as mnemonic I suppose
2009-12-26T01:12:00.000Z	elzoog	adminewb1	 The thing is, if it was for me I wouldn't care.  But I am setting up this netbook as a present for my 8 year old daughter.   So you can understand, I want to minimize confusing stuff.
2009-12-26T01:13:00.000Z	elzoog	adminewb1	 I don't want to change the name of the actual kernel.   I just want to change the TEXT that is displayed in the menu
2009-12-26T01:13:00.000Z	adminewb1	elzoog	to make your system bootable by nongeeks, would it be adequate simply to setup a default menu item with a timeout, so they just wait 10sec for it to go by itself?
2009-12-26T01:14:00.000Z	elzoog	adminewb1	 Well, one thing I DO like about grub2, is there is an option to automatically boot to the last OS you booted to before.   So if the last time you booted to Ubuntu, it will default to Ubuntu.   If the last time you booted to Windows, the next time the default will be Windows.
2009-12-26T01:15:00.000Z	adminewb1	elzoog	customizing the boot menu item text (without changing internal representations) means you're on the hook for keeping that in place, while the automated system of updating grub.cfg is going to clobber your changes
2009-12-26T01:16:00.000Z	elzoog	adminewb1	 The thing is, when most people think of booting to an OS, they think of booting to Ubuntu, not Ubuntu generic 2.18.12938
2009-12-26T01:17:00.000Z	elzoog	adminewb1	 So if you want to make it so that PEOPLE can easily use it, you should show them what they understand.
2009-12-26T01:19:00.000Z	adminewb1	elzoog	maybe I'm missing something; your gripe is with grub2, not legacy grub yes?
2009-12-26T01:19:00.000Z	elzoog	adminewb1	 Also, it should give you the option of deleting old kernels so that your menu doesn't end up getting cluttered up
2009-12-26T01:20:00.000Z	elzoog	adminewb1	 Yeah, with legacy grub, I would not be having so much of a problem.
2009-12-26T01:20:00.000Z	adminewb1	elzoog	did you want a GUI tool that simplifies the management of grub2 customizing?
2009-12-26T01:20:00.000Z	elzoog	adminewb1	 Does a GUI tool like that exist?
2009-12-26T01:21:00.000Z	adminewb1	elzoog	I think there is, but it may not suit everyone or be flexible enough for all purposes
2009-12-26T01:22:00.000Z	elzoog	adminewb1	 Well, a GUI tool even if it doesn't do everything, would be better than reading confusing docs and trying to figure out which text file to edit.
