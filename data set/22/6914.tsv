2006-06-23T10:32:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	tao36	startx
2006-06-23T10:33:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	tao36	but the oem prabably doesnt install the xserver
2006-06-23T10:33:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	tao36	if you want the gui u need to install using the textmode
2006-06-23T10:33:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	tao36	but i think u can just download it from the libs
2006-06-23T10:34:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	tao36	the repos i mean
2006-06-23T10:36:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	tao36	if u cant find it just reinstall using the textmode install
2006-06-23T10:36:00.000Z	tao36	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	do you sugest me to reinstall in textmode?
2006-06-23T10:36:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	tao36	yup textmode installs the x and gui
2006-06-23T10:38:00.000Z	tao36	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	im assuming you know xubunto oem? ;)
2006-06-23T10:39:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	tao36	no but the first time i was installing i did the oem install , it didnt have a gui , so then i did a server install and it didnt have the gui either , so now i know the text mode has what i want
2006-06-23T10:40:00.000Z	tao36	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	thanks! :)

2006-06-23T10:45:00.000Z	tao36	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	its also a school project itself!!
