2008-12-25T19:13:00.000Z	cow_2001		guys, there are several apps working in the background of my ubuntu which hump my keys so now I can't even use capslock and when I use my photoshop cs2 wine installation, i can't use delete/backspace keys to undo the last point when i use the magnetic lasso tool. What should I do?
2008-12-25T19:14:00.000Z	remite	cow_2001	get gimp
2008-12-25T19:14:00.000Z	cow_2001	remite	funny.
2008-12-25T19:15:00.000Z	cow_2001	remite	there's no hebrew documentation for gimp. photoshops cs2 has TONS of hebrew books
2008-12-25T19:19:00.000Z	remite	cow_2001	maybe the keyboard map
2008-12-25T19:21:00.000Z	cow_2001	remite	System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts?
2008-12-25T19:21:00.000Z	remite	cow_2001	keyboard layout
2008-12-25T19:25:00.000Z	cow_2001	remite	thanks!
2008-12-25T19:26:00.000Z	cow_2001	remite	what i'm curious about is that the capslock behaviour was set on default, but my default behaviour isn't "flip capitalization" but something completely else.
