2010-10-04T08:51:00.000Z	theanalyst		is there support for monitor color calibration in ubuntu? ie can i control RGB contrast and brightness?
2010-10-04T08:52:00.000Z	MeanEYE	theanalyst	you can get bunch of them online web based
2010-10-04T08:53:00.000Z	theanalyst	MeanEYE	 web based?
2010-10-04T08:53:00.000Z	MeanEYE	theanalyst	yeah... want me to find you one?
2010-10-04T08:54:00.000Z	theanalyst	MeanEYE	 tried some not exactly what i am looking for, i am running on a very old monitor, whose display is pretty messed up...Red is too dominant...
2010-10-04T08:55:00.000Z	MeanEYE	theanalyst	hm, not sure how to help then... I was looking for the same thing since I have 2 same monitors except one is on DVI and other on VGA...
2010-10-04T08:58:00.000Z	theanalyst	MeanEYE	 well on windows there used to be that intel graphicx driver setting where you can adgust the RGB contrast, is there something similar on X? like can i individually calibrate R,G,B on Xorg.cong
2010-10-04T08:58:00.000Z	MeanEYE	theanalyst	which graphics card you have?
2010-10-04T08:59:00.000Z	theanalyst	MeanEYE	 its just the on-board graphics...82945G i believe...
2010-10-04T08:59:00.000Z	MeanEYE	theanalyst	intel you mean?
2010-10-04T09:00:00.000Z	theanalyst	MeanEYE	 yep..no external graphics card...its an old box which i may have to use for a week or two..
2010-10-04T09:04:00.000Z	MeanEYE	theanalyst	there's a package in ubuntu named gnome-color-manager, check if that helps
2010-10-04T09:05:00.000Z	theanalyst	MeanEYE	 yep tried that...you cant calibrate RGB individually in that..which is what i want...
2010-10-04T09:07:00.000Z	MeanEYE	theanalyst	is the display way too redish (or any other color)?
2010-10-04T09:08:00.000Z	theanalyst	MeanEYE	 yep way too reddish...
2010-10-04T09:08:00.000Z	MeanEYE	theanalyst	hm, old vga displays had problems with cables sometimes... I know it's stupid but did you try checking the cable or using another one?
2010-10-04T09:10:00.000Z	theanalyst	MeanEYE	 ya tried playing with the hardware...kind of afraid to open a CRT monitor up...you know high voltage and all..
2010-10-04T09:10:00.000Z	MeanEYE	theanalyst	ok :D am just covering all the stupid angles
2010-10-04T09:10:00.000Z	MeanEYE	theanalyst	problem seems software unsolveable
2010-10-04T09:13:00.000Z	theanalyst	MeanEYE	 well not unsolveable ..the intel onboard driver on windows had this calibration tool wher you can set contrast brightness of RGB individually like you do for images in gimp nd all..presently playing around with xgamma....but too much of a pain to get that right
2010-10-04T09:14:00.000Z	MeanEYE	theanalyst	hm, true... but old CRT with color issues. I don't think you can solve that by adjusting colors in system. not that am lazy to help but from my personal experience thats the way things are... I can dig arround a little bit more if you wish... I might find something...
2010-10-04T09:18:00.000Z	theanalyst	MeanEYE	 yep its not software solvable i guess...tried most of the open source graphics softwares...nothing quite what i want..
