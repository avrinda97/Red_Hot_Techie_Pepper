2007-03-01T14:42:00.000Z	r4nge		is it possible to set up a cron job that logs into a website as if a user was browsing it
2007-03-01T14:42:00.000Z	r4nge		a site that requires a login/pass through a cgi form
2007-03-01T14:43:00.000Z	eck	r4nge	of course, but you will have to know some web programming
2007-03-01T14:44:00.000Z	eck	r4nge	i'm not sure how complicated what you want to do is, but it is probably a job for perl or python
2007-03-08T16:28:00.000Z	eck	r4nge	i hope you know sed :-)
2007-03-08T16:29:00.000Z	eck	r4nge	you can't just do it with grep, you need sed/perl/python (awk?)
2007-03-16T15:48:00.000Z	eck	r4nge	why do you want to remove atd?
2007-03-16T15:50:00.000Z	eck	r4nge	if something else depends on it (i doubt anything does) you could break things by removing it
2007-03-16T15:50:00.000Z	eck	r4nge	but most people don't use it so you're probably safe
2007-03-16T15:52:00.000Z	r4nge	eck	so you would have atd do something in the future in case what you were going to work on broke something
2007-03-16T15:53:00.000Z	eck	r4nge	for example, if i was going to change iptables, i would have an at job to restore the old settings in ten minutes, so if the new settings break something i can still get back to the box
2007-03-16T15:54:00.000Z	eck	r4nge	if everything goes smoothly you just remove the job from the queue
2007-03-16T15:58:00.000Z	eck	r4nge	yeah, they're actually mostly sharing memory so they don't use as much ram as you would think
2007-03-19T11:14:00.000Z	eck	r4nge	it uses both, i'm not really sure under which scenarios though
2007-03-19T11:15:00.000Z	r4nge	eck	this is the syslog entry... http://rafb.net/p/xXI42U34.html
2007-03-19T11:15:00.000Z	eck	r4nge	also, if that is the case, then it is a bug in dhclient
2007-03-19T11:15:00.000Z	eck	r4nge	ok, then run it is aroot?
2007-03-19T11:17:00.000Z	eck	r4nge	um, are you trying to use dhcp or not?
2007-03-19T11:17:00.000Z	r4nge	eck	my isp assigns the ip address, cable modem straight to the box
2007-03-19T11:19:00.000Z	eck	r4nge	just use the dhcp lease the cable modem gives out, it will be correct
2007-03-19T11:19:00.000Z	r4nge	eck	so no need for dhcpclient running?
