2005-12-09T13:06:00.000Z	JustinG		0000:00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp. 82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 03)
2005-12-09T13:06:00.000Z	JustinG		yeah
2005-12-09T13:07:00.000Z	JustinG		nothing doing
2005-12-09T13:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	JustinG	does 'aplay -l' list your sound card ?
2005-12-09T13:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	JustinG	(don't paste here ;)
2005-12-09T13:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	JustinG	ok, and can you play a .wav file?
2005-12-09T13:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	JustinG	something like 'aplay /usr/share/sounds/login.wav' ?
2005-12-09T13:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	JustinG	no error or anything?
2005-12-09T13:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	JustinG	ok, fire up alsamixer
2005-12-09T13:11:00.000Z	HappyFool	JustinG	use the left and right arrows to choose channels, up and down to adjust volume and 'm' to mute/unute
2005-12-09T13:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	JustinG	you've gotten this sound card working under slackware?
2005-12-09T13:13:00.000Z	JustinG	HappyFool	not this laptop's sound card no, but i know the general troubleshooting methods of fixing the sound since its usually muted by default.
2005-12-09T13:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	JustinG	if memory serves, there have been a few cases where some channels need to be muted (some IEC channels, i think), though maybe that no longer applies
2005-12-09T13:15:00.000Z	JustinG	HappyFool	doesn't hurt to try
2005-12-09T13:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	JustinG	at this point all i can suggest is googling on linux + your sound card, or wait for crimsun to be around. You could also try the forums (ubuntuforms.org)
