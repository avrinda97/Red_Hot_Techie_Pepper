2005-01-24T11:08:00.000Z	froust		okay
2005-01-24T11:08:00.000Z	froust		to clarify - spatial mode == what exaclty/
2005-01-24T11:09:00.000Z	froust		thought so
2005-01-24T11:09:00.000Z	jdub	froust	the default way nautilus works is to represent a one-to-one relationship between folders and their windows.
2005-01-24T11:10:00.000Z	jdub	froust	so they have a consistent location.
2005-01-24T13:08:00.000Z	jdub	froust	/vmlinuz
2005-01-24T14:09:00.000Z	jdub	froust	in what context? amd64?
2005-01-24T14:10:00.000Z	jdub	froust	you can run both on amd64 (in fact, OOo is 32bit in warty and hoary)
2005-01-24T14:10:00.000Z	jdub	froust	to 'migrate', install the amd64 version
2005-01-24T14:10:00.000Z	froust	jdub	i mean if i installed the 32 bit version
2005-01-26T15:13:00.000Z	jdub	froust	run cfdisk /dev/hda (or whatever your device is)
2005-01-26T15:15:00.000Z	jdub	froust	cfdisk will tell you which one is swap, and what order they're in
2005-01-26T15:16:00.000Z	froust	jdub	didn't add mine...
2005-01-29T07:41:00.000Z	jdub	froust	the new drivers have just been uploaded to hoary
2005-01-29T07:41:00.000Z	jdub	froust	always use the drivers provided with ubuntu
2005-01-29T07:41:00.000Z	jdub	froust	(but yes, ubuntu can install rpms with alien, but it's not the best way of doing things)
2005-01-29T07:55:00.000Z	jdub	froust	dude, the package was *just* uploaded. it hasn't built  yet.
2005-02-07T11:37:00.000Z	jdub	froust	msttcorefonts
2005-02-07T11:49:00.000Z	jdub	froust	vsftpd
2005-02-22T10:50:00.000Z	jdub	froust	no, it's not; use ordered (the default).
2005-02-22T10:50:00.000Z	jdub	froust	your data is more important than speed.
2005-02-22T10:51:00.000Z	froust	jdub	so it's still kinda buggy then?
