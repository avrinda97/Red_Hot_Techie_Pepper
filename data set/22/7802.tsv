2005-12-29T17:49:00.000Z	toya_		so can anyone help me with my g++ problem?
2005-12-29T17:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	toya_	 sudo apt-get inatall build-essential
2005-12-29T17:50:00.000Z	toya_	thoreauputic	ok i'll try
2005-12-29T17:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	toya_	 sorry Install
2005-12-29T17:52:00.000Z	toya_	thoreauputic	how do i run my program now
2005-12-29T17:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	toya_	erm - same way as before I assume ( didn't see what you did)
2005-12-29T17:53:00.000Z	toya_	thoreauputic	what i did was g++ -o program test.cpp
2005-12-29T17:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	toya_	and what happens now if you run that again?
2005-12-29T17:54:00.000Z	toya_	thoreauputic	in windows i used something called msys which is like some kind of mini linux environment i think, and all i had to do to run the program was type the name
2005-12-29T17:54:00.000Z	toya_	thoreauputic	if i do g++ -o program test.cpp i think it would compile it again as program
2005-12-29T17:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	toya_	I asume you are compiling it , not running it?
2005-12-29T17:55:00.000Z	toya_	thoreauputic	oh now i want to run it
2005-12-29T17:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	toya_	 ./programname  (assuming you made it executable)
2005-12-29T17:56:00.000Z	toya_	thoreauputic	ok thanks a lot, so ./ is to run exectuables?
2005-12-29T17:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	toya_	from the same directory, yes
2005-12-29T17:56:00.000Z	toya_	thoreauputic	thank you
2005-12-29T17:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	toya_	 chmod +x programname to set the executable bit
2005-12-29T06:02:00.000Z	toya_	thoreauputic	can you help me with installing java too?
2005-12-29T07:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	toya_	I use .bashrc
2005-12-29T07:01:00.000Z	toya_	thoreauputic	the only difference is that .bashrc if exists is executed by .bash_profile right?
2005-12-29T07:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	toya_	so it says in the file, yes :)
2005-12-29T07:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	toya_	I think .bashrc is the file you want
