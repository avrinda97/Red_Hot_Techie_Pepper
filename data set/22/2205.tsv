2009-10-30T01:37:00.000Z	Hillshum		What should happen when my machine gets hot? Should it just hang on me?
2009-10-30T01:38:00.000Z	mnaines1	Hillshum	It does so by using less resources...
2009-10-30T01:39:00.000Z	mnaines1	Hillshum	Ubuntu does not put as much of a load on the system as Windows does, so because of that, the system runs cooler
2009-10-30T01:39:00.000Z	Hillshum	mnaines1	Not on my machine...
2009-10-30T01:40:00.000Z	mnaines1	Hillshum	What problem are you having?
2009-10-30T01:41:00.000Z	Hillshum	mnaines1	When running my system hard, it will blank the screen and hang
2009-10-30T01:41:00.000Z	mnaines1	Hillshum	Pastebin the specs of your system
2009-10-30T01:42:00.000Z	Hillshum	mnaines1	Is there a command or do I type them up myself?
2009-10-30T01:42:00.000Z	mnaines1	Hillshum	Just type them up yourself
2009-10-30T01:44:00.000Z	Hillshum	mnaines1	Anything in particular I should add?
2009-10-30T01:45:00.000Z	mnaines1	Hillshum	I just need the CPU clock speed, hard drive capacity and used space, RAM capacity and used space, and video card type

2009-10-30T01:52:00.000Z	mnaines1	Hillshum	Is this a laptop?
2009-10-30T01:52:00.000Z	Hillshum	mnaines1	Yes. HP 6735b
2009-10-30T01:53:00.000Z	mnaines1	Hillshum	And what are you doing that eats up so many resources?
2009-10-30T01:55:00.000Z	Hillshum	mnaines1	Various things. Gaming can do it, installing Ubuntu server in a desktop while surfing the web and playing flash games has done it, compiling does it
2009-10-30T01:56:00.000Z	mnaines1	Hillshum	There's your problem.  Your laptop's video card is not designed for gaming
2009-10-30T01:57:00.000Z	Hillshum	mnaines1	But compiling doesn't use my gpu....
2009-10-30T01:57:00.000Z	mnaines1	Hillshum	The gaming does, though
2009-10-30T01:58:00.000Z	Hillshum	mnaines1	I can live with that, but is there a way to improve my system's heat management?
2009-10-30T01:58:00.000Z	mnaines1	Hillshum	The only way is to stop using the high-demand applications
2009-10-30T01:59:00.000Z	Hillshum	mnaines1	Under Windows and Jaunty there was much less of a problem
