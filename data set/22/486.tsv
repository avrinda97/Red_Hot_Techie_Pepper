2012-07-16T21:25:00.000Z	DaSpawn		 Muelli: still ther>?
2012-07-16T21:26:00.000Z	DaSpawn		you asked how did I do it, what are you refering to?
2012-07-16T21:28:00.000Z	DaSpawn		update-initramfs -u -v
2012-07-16T21:29:00.000Z	DaSpawn		gets to Calling Hook cryptroot
2012-07-16T21:29:00.000Z	DaSpawn		then device-mapper: table iocth failed: no such device or address
2012-07-16T21:30:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	*where* does this error appear? I.e. during creation of the ramdisk?
2012-07-16T21:04:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	how do you know that you cannot generate proper initramfs'?
2012-07-16T21:05:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	sounds like you haven't set up your chroot properly. Mount /dev, /proc and /sys into the chroot.
2012-07-16T21:08:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	might be missing drivers.
2012-07-16T21:09:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	well, babysteps. what caused the fuckup anyway? You mentioned a not properly installed kernel..?
2012-07-16T21:15:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	how did you do it then?
2012-07-16T21:26:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	yes
2012-07-16T21:28:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	like how you recreated the initramfs
2012-07-16T21:31:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	*where* does this error appear? I.e. during creation of the ramdisk?
2012-07-16T21:31:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	k. Are you running the live cd now and do you have your sysimage mounted? Then pastebin us the output of "mount"
2012-07-16T21:33:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	Then pastebin us the output of "mount"
2012-07-16T21:41:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	hm. looks good. can you pastebin us the output of initramfs-update -u then?
2012-07-16T21:50:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	shouldn't matter as this is your "real" system anyway.
2012-07-16T21:51:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	hm. interesting. Can you, just for the fun, rename /etc/initramfs.conf.d (or whatever it's called) and try again to cretae the initramfs?
2012-07-16T21:51:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	and also for the record do smth like sudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda2  | grep Cipher
2012-07-16T21:59:00.000Z	Muelli	DaSpawn	eh, yeah, so maybe apt-get install --reinstall initramfs-tools to get the config back
2012-07-16T22:44:00.000Z	DaSpawn	Muelli	still around?
