2007-03-24T16:36:00.000Z	BeepAU		Hi, I just did a fresh install of ubuntu edgy then a system update, I need to have these installed - Linux 2.6 kernel with kernel sources (or headers), GCC Compiler, Binutils, GNU Make, GTK/GLIB 2.0 libraries - can someone please give me a command to get all this stuff?
2007-03-24T16:37:00.000Z	SeveredCross	BeepAU	Use Synaptic and find the packages
2007-03-24T16:37:00.000Z	BeepAU	SeveredCross	-- do you know what they're called?
2007-03-24T16:38:00.000Z	SeveredCross	BeepAU	Just filter the list by name
2007-03-24T16:38:00.000Z	SeveredCross		If you need the 2.6 kernel, just type linux kernel into the list, it'll show you a list of all packages relating to the kernel.
2007-03-24T16:38:00.000Z	SeveredCross		If you need gcc, type gcc.
2007-03-24T16:39:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Though, to get gcc, binutils, make, you might just be able to do sudo apt-get install build-essential
2007-03-24T16:39:00.000Z	SeveredCross		I think that grabs GCC, G++, Make, etc.
2007-03-24T16:40:00.000Z	BeepAU	SeveredCross	-- wil that get me Linux 2.6 kernel with kernel sources (or headers) and GTK/GLIB 2.0 libraries ?
2007-03-24T16:40:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Nope.
2007-03-24T16:40:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Those are separate BeepAU.
2007-03-24T16:40:00.000Z	BeepAU	SeveredCross	-- how can i get them?
2007-03-24T16:41:00.000Z	SeveredCross		For the kernel, you need to know exactly which kernel version you need, and the command would be something like sudo apt-get install linux-kernel-2.6.x.x-image or something like that.
2007-03-24T16:41:00.000Z	SeveredCross	BeepAU	Using Synaptic is better, just filter the list.
2007-03-24T16:42:00.000Z	BeepAU	SeveredCross	-- $ uname -r gets me 2.6.17-11-generic
2007-03-24T16:42:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Well, you already have the 2.6 kernel then.
2007-03-24T16:42:00.000Z	SeveredCross		You don't need another kernel. :)
2007-03-24T16:42:00.000Z	BeepAU	SeveredCross	--what about the kernel sources or headers thing?
2007-03-24T16:42:00.000Z	SeveredCross		And if you're running Ubuntu, you have Gnome, so you probably have GTK 2+
2007-03-24T16:43:00.000Z	SeveredCross	BeepAU	Um, try sudo apt-get install linux-kernel-2.6.17-11-sources or something.
2007-03-24T16:43:00.000Z	SeveredCross		I'm telling you, use Synaptic....
2007-03-24T16:43:00.000Z	BeepAU	SeveredCross	-- i'll search in synaptic
