2011-10-22T19:38:00.000Z	mpavel	Pavilliox	you can repeat yourself plenty even with OOP :)
2011-10-22T19:38:00.000Z	Pavilliox	mpavel	That's true but not as often
2011-10-22T19:38:00.000Z	mpavel	Pavilliox	it happens quite often in scripting languages, like PHP
2011-10-22T19:39:00.000Z	Pavilliox	mpavel	It happens in every language if you don't know how to code DRY :p
2011-10-22T19:39:00.000Z	mpavel	Pavilliox	:)
2011-10-22T19:39:00.000Z	mpavel	Pavilliox	fan stops after wakeup from suspend
2011-10-22T19:39:00.000Z	Pavilliox	mpavel	That doesn't sound like a Ubuntu-specific issue
2011-10-22T19:40:00.000Z	mpavel	Pavilliox	yeah, I'll need to check about a bios update or something - just thought I'll see of anybody having same issue first
2011-10-22T19:40:00.000Z	Pavilliox	mpavel	Yeah it might be the BIOS
2011-10-22T19:43:00.000Z	mpavel	Pavilliox	I don't mind Unity, it's quite good. honesty though I can't see the benefit over standard gnome (what was before)
2011-10-22T19:43:00.000Z	Pavilliox	mpavel	I think it's good looking, and it's just a step towards the future of Ubuntu I guess
2011-10-22T19:44:00.000Z	mpavel	Pavilliox	yes. I just really want the guys behind Ubuntu to think for themselves - not trying to be insulting - and not simply copy from win&mac - try to have a vision for the product itself
