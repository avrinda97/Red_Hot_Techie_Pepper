2012-08-10T06:13:00.000Z	brophat		ok I made some changes to compiz, now ubuntu is crashed but ubuntu 2D works
2012-08-10T06:14:00.000Z	brophat		anyone want to help me get ubuntu back? and what is the diff between ubuntu 2D and just ubuntu
2012-08-10T06:14:00.000Z	DebolazW	brophat	Ubuntu2D doesn't use compiz.
2012-08-10T06:14:00.000Z	brophat	DebolazW	should I just keep using Ubuntu2D, ?
2012-08-10T06:15:00.000Z	brophat	DebolazW	how to I get ubuntu back
2012-08-10T06:15:00.000Z	DebolazW	brophat	There's nothing wrong with using Unity2D if it works, but how to fix compiz depends on what exactly you did with compiz.
2012-08-10T06:15:00.000Z	brophat	DebolazW	I set top edge left edge and right edge to 0 in the grid setting
2012-08-10T06:16:00.000Z	DebolazW	brophat	In ccsm?
2012-08-10T06:17:00.000Z	brophat	DebolazW	in cofiguration editor
2012-08-10T06:17:00.000Z	DebolazW	brophat	Which configuration editor?
2012-08-10T06:20:00.000Z	DebolazW	brophat	This solution should still apply then: http://askubuntu.com/questions/71926/resetting-compizconfig-settings-manager-settings
2012-08-10T06:22:00.000Z	DebolazW	brophat	You really shouldn't be using that tool unless you know exactly what you are doing.
2012-08-10T06:22:00.000Z	DebolazW	brophat	Whoever recommended its use should be smacked in the head.
2012-08-10T06:22:00.000Z	brophat	DebolazW	I believe so
2012-08-10T06:22:00.000Z	brophat	DebolazW	but it has such a pretty icon looks like it would be user friendly
2012-08-10T06:23:00.000Z	DebolazW	brophat	If you want to customize Unity in the future, install MyUnity and use that tool. It's a lot safer.
2012-08-10T06:23:00.000Z	brophat	DebolazW	I am writing that down will do
2012-08-10T06:52:00.000Z	brophat	DebolazW	you know how to use MyUnity to stop unity from maximizing window when it is dragged to the top?
2012-08-10T06:52:00.000Z	DebolazW	brophat	I don't really customize my desktop much, so I'm probably not the right person to ask.
2012-08-10T06:53:00.000Z	brophat	DebolazW	you are ok with that annoying maximizing of windows when they are dragged to the top?
2012-08-10T06:53:00.000Z	DebolazW	brophat	I prefer my windows maximized. :)
2012-08-10T06:57:00.000Z	brophat	DebolazW	and wilee-nilee ok looks like I am back to normal, thanks for the help
