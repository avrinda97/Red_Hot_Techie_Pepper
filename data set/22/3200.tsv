2009-09-05T18:36:00.000Z	Zzeiss		What's the top-level package for the nvidia (ecch, ptui!) closed-source binary blob?  "apt-cache" fails to enlighten me...
2009-09-05T18:37:00.000Z	Zzeiss		Action: I'm on Jaunty.
2009-09-05T18:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zzeiss	and what does: sudo lshw -C display | grep product say?
2009-09-05T18:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zzeiss	what release are you using and which nvidia chip?
2009-09-05T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zzeiss	lsb_release -c   will tell you the release
2009-09-05T18:38:00.000Z	Zzeiss	ActionParsnip	and as to which nvidia card, I don't actually know.... but it did work back a year and a half ago, well enough to play Portal.
2009-09-05T18:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zzeiss	sudo lshw -C display | grep product
2009-09-05T18:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zzeiss	whats it output?
2009-09-05T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zzeiss	nice, ok then: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-180
2009-09-05T18:40:00.000Z	Zzeiss	ActionParsnip	"nvidia-glx-180 is already the newest version.:"
2009-09-05T18:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zzeiss	sudo apt-get --purge remove nvidia*; sudo apt-get --purge autoremove; sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-09-05T18:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zzeiss	then restart X, then run: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-180
2009-09-05T18:42:00.000Z	Zzeiss	ActionParsnip	Gotcha.  Thanks.
2009-09-05T18:54:00.000Z	Zzeiss	ActionParsnip	Well, if it's bigger, won
2009-09-05T18:54:00.000Z	Zzeiss	ActionParsnip	if it's bigger, won't the extra sectors be unused, as they won't be in the "available" chain in the new copy?
2009-09-05T18:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zzeiss	yuo got nvidia drivers now?
2009-09-05T18:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zzeiss	no the space is just unallocated
2009-09-05T18:55:00.000Z	Zzeiss	ActionParsnip	Yeah, but Portal still doesn't run.  :-(
2009-09-05T18:55:00.000Z	Zzeiss	ActionParsnip	Oh- true.  If you copy a full partition, then yes.  You will be able to put new partitions on the unused space.  I thought you meant copying a partition onto a newer, larger partition without using mkfs of some flavor.

2009-10-02T19:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zzeiss	apt-cache search foo
2009-10-02T19:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zzeiss	or if you are searching your installed apps: dpkg -l |  grep foo
