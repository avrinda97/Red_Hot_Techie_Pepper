2005-03-28T16:31:00.000Z	flawd		Would it be correct to describe Ubuntu as an "out of the box" desktop version of Debian? Isn't it the equivalent of let's say Mandrake but with the stability and structure of Debian?
2005-03-28T16:32:00.000Z	lunitik	flawd	its basically Sid with bug fixes and xorg...
2005-03-28T16:33:00.000Z	lunitik	flawd	actually... Sid doesn't have Gnome 2.10 yet either..
2005-03-28T16:33:00.000Z	flawd	lunitik	Do you think the i696 optimized debs will grow? Do you know if this is a goal of Ubuntu?
2005-03-28T16:33:00.000Z	lunitik	flawd	or the 'update-notification' and 'update-manager'  packages
2005-03-28T16:33:00.000Z	flawd	lunitik	icewm here heh
2005-03-28T16:34:00.000Z	lunitik	flawd	right now... its just libc-686 that is providing binary optimizations
2005-03-28T16:34:00.000Z	lunitik	flawd	sure... they are provided just like in Debian... via deb-src listings in sources.list
2005-03-28T16:35:00.000Z	flawd	lunitik	it was ages ago I tried debian so I did not recall
2005-03-28T16:35:00.000Z	lunitik	flawd	Ubuntu has a better packaging policy... any joe shmoe can build a package and upload for arch... often things are broken
2005-03-28T16:36:00.000Z	lunitik	flawd	not even related to what I meant, but ok
2005-03-28T16:37:00.000Z	lunitik	flawd	there are actually steps involved in being certified to maintain a package in Debian... for arch, nothing...
