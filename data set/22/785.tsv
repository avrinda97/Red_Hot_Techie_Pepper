2011-03-18T06:55:00.000Z	ericy	Thedemon007	It is often a good idea to inspect your connected drives, via:   sfdisk -l   -OR-   df -h    -OR-   blkid

2011-03-18T07:00:00.000Z	ericy	Thedemon007	OK, the last pastebin was output of blkid command.  Show me sfdisk -l  with your 4GB usb stick plugged in.

2011-03-18T07:02:00.000Z	ericy	Thedemon007	sudo sfdisk -l
2011-03-18T07:02:00.000Z	ericy	Thedemon007	Run the command: sudo sfdisk -l
2011-03-18T07:04:00.000Z	ericy	Thedemon007	See the /dev/sdd1 , that is what you should mount...
2011-03-18T07:04:00.000Z	ericy	Thedemon007	.. but tell me what you have installed on it ?
2011-03-18T07:07:00.000Z	Thedemon007	ericy	i believe what is a problem of kernel i compiled my kernel
2011-03-18T07:08:00.000Z	ericy	Thedemon007	Oh, yes I remember you discuss it with another person..
2011-03-18T07:09:00.000Z	ericy	Thedemon007	...but can you (or do you want to) try another  usb stick ?
2011-03-18T07:11:00.000Z	ericy	Thedemon007	Your last pastebin (581876), I saw already, but its too complicated for me.
2011-03-18T07:12:00.000Z	ericy	Thedemon007	Do you have Ubuntu installed on the 4 GB usb stick? (PS: Right now I am running Lubuntu 'Live-CD' on a 4GB usb stick.)
2011-03-18T07:13:00.000Z	Thedemon007	ericy	i need reboot i install kernel 2.6.35-27
2011-03-18T07:13:00.000Z	ericy	Thedemon007	OK. See you later.
2011-03-18T07:18:00.000Z	Thedemon007	ericy	kernel kernel 6.2.1935-27 work well the pendrive is very possible that I have compiled the kernel wrong
2011-03-18T07:19:00.000Z	ericy	Thedemon007	I see..
