2007-11-23T05:28:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	what are you trying to fix?
2007-11-23T05:29:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	what makes you think removing power manager is going to fix it?
2007-11-23T05:32:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	what this indicates is that the system is frozen. Don't shut it off with the power button when this happens
2007-11-23T05:32:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	it's safer to hold down Ctrl-Alt-SysRq and type R E I S U B in sequence
2007-11-23T05:34:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	get a friend to help. I can manage this with two hands after a bit of practice (holding down SysRq with my right fifth finger)
2007-11-23T05:35:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	holding down Ctrl-Alt-Sysrq makes your keyboard responsive again. You won't believe it until you've tried.
2007-11-23T05:35:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	let's come back to your freezes for a sec -- does this happen randomly?
2007-11-23T05:35:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	or have you found a way to provoke it?
2007-11-23T05:37:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	the first thing to check then is the RAM. In the boot menu, there is an option "memtest86". Boot that and let it run for a few hours (unless it shows errors, in which case you have to swap out RAM modules)
2007-11-23T05:38:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	how much you have doesn't come into it
2007-11-23T05:39:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	change it, then
2007-11-23T05:40:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	no point disabling power manager then
2007-11-23T06:08:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	so?
2007-11-23T06:12:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	how old is it?
2007-11-23T06:14:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	install smartmontools and check your hard disk drive with the tools in that package
2007-11-23T06:20:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	they are command line tools. Look at the documentation in /usr/share/doc/smartmontools
2007-11-23T06:20:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	or ask the channel for specific suggestions on how to examine your drive with those tools.
2007-11-23T06:21:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	you may have to enable S.M.A.R.T. monitoring in the BIOS setup
2007-11-23T06:23:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	what kind of computer do you have?
2007-11-23T06:25:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	you enter the BIOS setup by hitting Del or F2 in the early phase of booting
2007-11-23T06:25:00.000Z	soundray	Mark761966	there is normally a message on the screen
