2008-03-01T16:32:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	kalatian	that was the first place i went
2008-03-01T16:32:00.000Z	kalatian	EnvoyRising	ok, just checking :)
2008-03-01T16:33:00.000Z	kalatian	EnvoyRising	if you have one of those fancy boards with 8 difference audio jacks, make sure you've got the plug in the right hole ;)
2008-03-01T16:33:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	kalatian	its a built in mic
2008-03-01T16:34:00.000Z	kalatian	EnvoyRising	sorry, my mistake.  did you check to make sure that all the sliders are up in the volume control, and that all the tracks are available in preferences?
2008-03-01T16:35:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	kalatian	roger. i turned on all channels, turned everything up, then tested with every 'record from input' option available
2008-03-01T16:36:00.000Z	kalatian	EnvoyRising	what program are you using?
2008-03-01T16:36:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	kalatian	the default sound recorder
2008-03-01T16:36:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	kalatian	i'm open to using other software if you have suggestions
2008-03-01T16:37:00.000Z	kalatian	EnvoyRising	I'd highly recommend audacity
2008-03-01T16:37:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	kalatian	i was afraid you'd say that. seems a bit overkill. just need to record some korean phrases for this class. i'll get it anyways, maybe it'll help, lol
2008-03-01T16:38:00.000Z	kalatian	EnvoyRising	i only say that because I've never used the default sound recorder, and audacity seems to work ok for me :D
2008-03-01T16:38:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	kalatian	fair enough
2008-03-01T16:41:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	kalatian	i'm a step closer. it actually records, but I have a lot of static. will turn down a few channels to see if that helps
2008-03-01T16:41:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	kalatian	meanwhile, is there a noise cancellation feature in audacity?
2008-03-01T16:42:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	kalatian	nevermind, found it :-)
2008-03-01T16:42:00.000Z	kalatian	EnvoyRising	that's good :D I think there is a noise cancelation, but I don't know how to use it.  Your best bet is to mute a bunch of channels
2008-03-01T16:42:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	kalatian	vain I know, but I wish the widgets were prettier, lol
2008-03-01T16:42:00.000Z	kalatian	EnvoyRising	just out of curiousity, where is the noise canceling feature?
2008-03-01T16:43:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	kalatian	effect > noise removeal
2008-03-01T16:43:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	kalatian	i'l try and find an alternative once i finish my homework :P
