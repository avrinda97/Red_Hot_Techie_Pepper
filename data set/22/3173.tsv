2010-02-27T21:40:00.000Z	apparle		I am thinking of creating a GUI based application..... I want it to look at home in both GNOME and KDE..... which GUI should I use
2010-02-27T21:42:00.000Z	blakkheim	apparle	no
2010-02-27T21:42:00.000Z	apparle	blakkheim	why
2010-02-27T21:43:00.000Z	blakkheim	apparle	writing something in qt just isn't going to perfectly "fit in" with a gtk environment, in regards to appearance
2010-02-27T21:44:00.000Z	apparle	blakkheim	vice versa for GTK in kubuntu....
2010-02-27T21:44:00.000Z	blakkheim	apparle	yes
2010-03-29T01:00:00.000Z	blakkheim	apparle	ext3
2010-03-29T01:01:00.000Z	apparle	blakkheim	why do you suggest ext3.. and not ext4?
2010-03-29T01:02:00.000Z	blakkheim	apparle	stability, ext4 isn't as well implemented in ubuntu as others, possible data loss
2010-03-29T01:02:00.000Z	apparle	blakkheim	i experienced that... thanks
2010-10-25T01:23:00.000Z	blakkheim	apparle	what window manager?
2010-10-25T01:23:00.000Z	apparle	blakkheim	actually I want to start the application enna
2010-10-25T01:25:00.000Z	apparle	blakkheim	any ideas?
2010-10-25T01:25:00.000Z	blakkheim	apparle	you never told me what window manager you installed
2010-10-25T01:26:00.000Z	apparle	blakkheim	I want to start the application enna
2010-10-25T01:26:00.000Z	blakkheim	apparle	does that require X?
2010-10-25T01:26:00.000Z	apparle	blakkheim	yup
2010-10-25T01:26:00.000Z	blakkheim	apparle	do you not want to use a window manager or?
2010-10-25T01:27:00.000Z	apparle	blakkheim	arrrghhh I install xserver-xorg-core, but how to start it? when I run enna regarding display not available
2010-10-25T01:27:00.000Z	blakkheim	apparle	you need to install a window manager
2010-10-25T01:28:00.000Z	apparle	blakkheim	why? why can't I start an x application straight away
2010-10-25T01:28:00.000Z	blakkheim	apparle	you can put the application in your ~/.xinitrc "exec nameofprogram" and try typing startx - might work, but a window manager would be easier
