2006-12-25T17:46:00.000Z	nn	un_operateur	no
2006-12-25T17:42:00.000Z	nn	un_operateur	i assign different IPs from the same subnet to several cards in a machine on my terminal server
2006-12-25T17:42:00.000Z	nn	un_operateur	but it's a rare case
2006-12-25T17:43:00.000Z	un_operateur	nn	are you using a form of load balancing on the server?
2006-12-25T17:44:00.000Z	un_operateur	nn	IP load balancing i.e.?
2006-12-25T17:44:00.000Z	nn	un_operateur	sorta, i refuse clients
2006-12-25T17:44:00.000Z	nn	un_operateur	if more than X clients are connected to the IP, i refuse them, and they try the next "server"
2006-12-25T17:44:00.000Z	nn	un_operateur	kinda like how /etc/resolv.conf works
2006-12-25T17:45:00.000Z	un_operateur	nn	so it is load balancing basically
2006-12-25T17:45:00.000Z	nn	un_operateur	in a ghetto sense, yea
2006-12-25T17:46:00.000Z	un_operateur	nn	does the server connect up to a switch/router that does ip load balancing?
2006-12-25T17:46:00.000Z	nn	un_operateur	just several ports on a gigabit switch
2006-12-25T17:46:00.000Z	un_operateur	nn	i'm amazed you havent come across any troubles as of yet ..
2006-12-25T17:46:00.000Z	nn	un_operateur	why?
2006-12-25T17:47:00.000Z	nn	un_operateur	only issue i had was i had to set up dhcpd to only broadcast on one interface,because it was confusing itself
2006-12-25T17:49:00.000Z	un_operateur	nn	like i was saying -- when the server replies to clients -- how does it's kernel know which interface to use to send frames out of? if for example clients from 192.168.0.0/255 connect upto it .. and half connect upto one interface and half to another, the server has a 50% chance of choosing either with no definitive path
2006-12-25T17:50:00.000Z	nn	un_operateur	Ohh, i think i misunderstood what you meant previously
2006-12-25T17:51:00.000Z	un_operateur	nn	so, not only does that disrupt intermediate routers' and switches' arp tables because they are made up on the fly -- if one time,  one MAC address is used and another another is used, it puts a load on those devices
2006-12-25T17:51:00.000Z	nn	un_operateur	hm
2006-12-28T11:32:00.000Z	nn	un_operateur	You can do this..
2006-12-28T11:32:00.000Z	nn	un_operateur	It requires a package called rdesktop
2006-12-28T11:33:00.000Z	un_operateur	nn	oui, je sais, i use rdesktop all the time
