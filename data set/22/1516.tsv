2010-05-19T04:22:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	edbian	why dont they just make hdd's and fsb's faster?
2010-05-19T04:22:00.000Z	edbian	linux_is_my_hero	Making a hdd as fast as ram is pretty much impossibly right now but they're trying.
2010-05-19T04:24:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	edbian	& deco: my first linux machine is having issues.  my wifi logo doesn't show up on my panel, and that's if it boots.  its also having issues with the nvidea drivers.  everything was fine until a week after i upgraded. :-(
2010-05-19T04:25:00.000Z	edbian	linux_is_my_hero	When you get it to boot try adding the "notification area" applet to the panel.  That's where the little network applet hides.
2010-05-19T04:26:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	edbian	word. thanks :-)
2010-08-20T05:31:00.000Z	edbian	linux_is_my_hero	Are you calling yourself a noob?
2010-08-20T05:32:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	edbian	not a chance. but ive heard of so many distros that i just picked one.
2010-08-20T05:32:00.000Z	edbian	linux_is_my_hero	Arch is a linux distribution.  It's a "roll your own" style distro.  It gives you the linux kernel and a package manager and you build on top of that.
2010-08-20T05:32:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	edbian	ill definately try archlinux...:-)
2010-08-20T05:33:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	edbian	is it faster than ubuntu?
2010-08-20T05:33:00.000Z	edbian	linux_is_my_hero	It is faster because you're only running the software you are using.
2010-08-20T05:33:00.000Z	edbian	linux_is_my_hero	You could make it slower but installing a million things.
2010-08-20T05:36:00.000Z	edbian	linux_is_my_hero	arch demands time.  It can be frustrating if you don't know what you're doing.  It's a great way to learn linux though.
