2009-02-24T06:37:00.000Z	uoaphys		can't close it
2009-02-24T06:38:00.000Z	uoaphys		So does anyone know whats up with my usb flash drive? it won't mount when I stick it in, says invalid mounting options
2009-02-24T06:38:00.000Z	uoaphys		is there a way I can manually mount it and see if it will work?
2009-02-24T06:39:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	uoaphys	Depends on how you backed up/images your previous hdd
2009-02-24T06:39:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	uoaphys	Oh wait, never mind... I mixed you and att0, sorry
2009-02-24T06:40:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	uoaphys	Yeah, you can manually mount it, mount /dev/<device_name> /path/to/mount
2009-02-24T06:40:00.000Z	uoaphys	WebcamWonder	; how do I know the device name for a usb flash drive?
2009-02-24T06:40:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	uoaphys	sudo fdisk -l, to list all the partitions
2009-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	uoaphys	mount -t fat32 /dev/<partition> /path/to/mount
2009-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	uoaphys	It should pick up fat automatically, but wait
2009-02-24T06:52:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	uoaphys	By USB flash drive, I suppose you mean a card, with a card reader on your pc?
2009-02-24T06:54:00.000Z	uoaphys	WebcamWonder	; no I mean like a jump drive
2009-02-24T06:54:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	uoaphys	That should be simple, stick the memory kehy into your USB, even if Ubuntu complains, hit ok, open up terminal, mount it manually
2009-02-24T06:55:00.000Z	uoaphys	WebcamWonder	ok I did this, now when I try to drag and drop files it says permissions denied
2009-02-24T06:55:00.000Z	uoaphys	WebcamWonder	I created a folder called /media/ufd and manually mounted it there in terminal using sudo
