2012-03-09T20:41:00.000Z	iHarp		<< Need help with .deb installs. I ran "sudo dpkg -i package_file.deb" but I can't find the installation after.
2012-03-09T20:41:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	what are you trying to install
2012-03-09T20:42:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	where did you get this package ?
2012-03-09T20:44:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	sudo apt-get ipheth-utils should get it
2012-03-09T20:44:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	you didn't have to download that
2012-03-09T20:44:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	it's in the universe repo
2012-03-09T20:45:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	I'd recommand getting it from the repo now to make sure you have all the dependencies
2012-03-09T20:46:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	not the no-icon issue
2012-03-09T20:46:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	I doubt there is an icon/menu item for it in the package
2012-03-09T20:47:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	yes I read what it is
2012-03-09T20:47:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	you may already have the dependencies
2012-03-09T20:47:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	why do you think it's not working
2012-03-09T20:48:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	how are you trying to tether it ?
2012-03-09T20:50:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	ok - so how are you trying to tether the phone
2012-03-09T20:51:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	no, that's just plugging something in, how are you trying to actually tether the device
2012-03-09T20:56:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	no, you need to use tethering software, and ipheth will allow your tethering software to use the iphone
2012-03-09T20:56:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	ipheth is not the tethering software it's self
2012-03-09T20:57:00.000Z	iHarp	ikonia	I think I see where you are going with that. Perhaps I just didn't understand the functionality. thanks.
2012-03-09T20:58:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	try the gnome network manager, it "should" just show you the tethering option now
2012-06-27T01:20:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	because you are not sourcing roots environment. 1.) you should not be root 2.) you should not be doing "su" as root, you are already root
2012-06-27T01:20:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	ubuntu is built around the sudo model, you should be using it
2012-06-27T01:21:00.000Z	ikonia	iHarp	there is no need for "root" for that
