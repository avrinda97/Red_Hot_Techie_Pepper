2007-04-05T07:22:00.000Z	kylecasey		i been messing around with this thing for 3 days
2007-04-05T07:22:00.000Z	bruenig	kylecasey	what is the problem
2007-04-05T07:23:00.000Z	bruenig	kylecasey	are you trying to install the .bin or what exactly
2007-04-05T07:24:00.000Z	bruenig	kylecasey	yeah I have integrated garbage, so can't help you there
2007-04-05T07:24:00.000Z	bruenig	kylecasey	perhaps try the envy script?
2007-04-05T07:25:00.000Z	bruenig	kylecasey	yeah what ubotu just said
2007-04-05T07:31:00.000Z	kylecasey	bruenig	hendrix just downloaded easyubuntu and its installing right now
2007-04-05T07:35:00.000Z	bruenig	kylecasey	yeah I feared that might happen, because you already tried to install, it doesn't work
2007-04-05T07:39:00.000Z	kylecasey	bruenig	hendrix any ideas on what i might try now?
2007-04-05T07:39:00.000Z	bruenig	kylecasey	none here
2007-04-05T08:05:00.000Z	kylecasey	bruenig	welcome back
2007-04-05T08:07:00.000Z	bruenig	kylecasey	it means the command was successful and worked
2007-04-05T08:07:00.000Z	bruenig	kylecasey	all that command is meant to do is create it
