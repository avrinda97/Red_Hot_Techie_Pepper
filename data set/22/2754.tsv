2009-03-18T01:24:00.000Z	blom1		I'm trying to restore grub; when doing "find /boot/grub/stage1" i get -> (hd0,1),  what values do i put in: root (hdX, Y)?
2009-03-18T01:25:00.000Z	confrey	blom1	how much harddisk are you using?
2009-03-18T01:25:00.000Z	blom1	confrey	i have 2 physical harddisks
2009-03-18T01:26:00.000Z	confrey	blom1	well, first number is for the harddisk, ( 0 or 1), second number is for harddisk partition
2009-03-18T01:27:00.000Z	confrey	blom1	hd(0,1) is for the SECOND partition of the FIRST disk
2009-03-18T01:28:00.000Z	blom1	confrey	thanks for the info :-)
2009-03-18T01:28:00.000Z	confrey	blom1	:)
2009-03-18T01:29:00.000Z	blom1	confrey	when using root hd(0,1) , iget the error: "unrecognized device string"
2009-03-18T01:36:00.000Z	confrey	blom1	are you using the installation  where do you wont to restore grub in?
2009-03-18T01:38:00.000Z	blom1	confrey	i'm using the livecd, i installed xp which overwritten grub
2009-03-18T01:38:00.000Z	confrey	blom1	so have you a linux system with grub installed?
2009-03-18T01:39:00.000Z	confrey	blom1	in the harddisk I mean
2009-03-18T01:39:00.000Z	blom1	confrey	yes, ubuntu 8.10
2009-03-18T01:40:00.000Z	confrey	blom1	I thunk tha faster way is to create a bootable usb stick, wiith grub, the  booting system using the grub shell by usbstick
2009-03-18T01:41:00.000Z	blom1	confrey	i'm using this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows?action=show&redirect=RestoreGrub
2009-03-18T01:42:00.000Z	confrey	blom1	ok,then you are trying to chroot in the linux installation, so you must mount /dev, mtab and so on, and then chroot in the installed system, and then must run grub
2009-03-18T01:43:00.000Z	confrey	blom1	you can do the same, esasly, by the grub shell
2009-03-18T01:44:00.000Z	blom1	confrey	yes.. im on grub right now, but what does the root (hdX, Y) refer to  when i have (hd0, 1) when doing : grub> find /boot/grub/stage1 ?
2009-03-18T01:45:00.000Z	confrey	blom1	use a usb stick, do an 'install-mbr ' to it, do a grub-install to it, create a /boot dir, a /boot/grub dir, copy int it the manu.lst you can find in your installed 8.10, abd boot from usbstick
2009-03-18T01:49:00.000Z	blom1	confrey	i already have an usb stick with ubuntu in it.. i just need the values of root (hdX, Y) from this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows?action=show&redirect=RestoreGrub
2009-03-18T01:51:00.000Z	confrey	blom1	well, the answer is very simple... in which harddisk and in which partitioon did you installed 8.10?
2009-03-18T01:53:00.000Z	blom1	confrey	i got it to work, i had a typo :-D
