2008-11-23T11:33:00.000Z	Cr		Question for anyone with a netbook. I am running a EEEPC and running a dual boot of Ubuntu 8.10 and XP. 8.10 Runs fine but runs a little slow for me. I figured I would try eeebuntu before I just reinstall with xfce. But eeebuntu just goes straight to a command prompt but not logged in as a user. How can I tell Ubuntu to copy an ISO to usb? (Newish to linux)
2008-11-23T11:33:00.000Z	Cr		On an Aspire One**
2008-11-23T11:33:00.000Z	xtknight	Cr	system->admin->create a usb startup disk u mean?
2008-11-23T11:34:00.000Z	Cr	xtknight	Yes, I wanna try the eeebuntu cause I have been told it works really well with the aspire one but the unetbootin program won't load the iso properly to the usb
2008-11-23T11:35:00.000Z	Cr	xtknight	but when I try to make a usb boot of it in linux it brings me to some kind of odd terminal
2008-11-23T11:35:00.000Z	xtknight	Cr	busybox probably/
2008-11-23T11:35:00.000Z	Cr	xtknight	yup busybox
2008-11-23T11:35:00.000Z	xtknight	Cr	i dunno really all i can suggest is that menu item for creatig a usb startup disk.  i know nothing beyond that.  sorry
2008-11-23T11:36:00.000Z	Cr	xtknight	is there a way to tell busy box to install the usb boot? I haven't used linux in 8 years (last time was slackware so I kinda rusty)
2008-11-23T11:36:00.000Z	xtknight	Cr	busybox is there because there's a problem.  busybox is "all it can give you"....so it falls back on it
2008-11-23T11:36:00.000Z	xtknight	Cr	and busybox is very limited
2008-11-23T11:38:00.000Z	Cr	xtknight	ok. I have heard of a way via called isotostick.sh. Have you ever heard of this?
2008-11-23T11:38:00.000Z	xtknight	Cr	nope is there a guide url where you see that file?
2008-11-23T11:38:00.000Z	Cr	xtknight	Googled eeebuntu usb. But can't find instructions on how to get the file just the command of sudo sh ./isotostick.sh ./[ISO FILE].iso /dev/sdb
2008-11-23T11:39:00.000Z	xtknight	Cr	oh so you need the file isotostick.sh
2008-11-23T11:40:00.000Z	Cr	xtknight	I am going to lean towards yes.

2008-11-23T11:41:00.000Z	Cr	xtknight	Thank you so much.
2008-11-23T11:41:00.000Z	xtknight	Cr	all i really did was punch it into gooogle
2008-11-23T11:42:00.000Z	Cr	xtknight	The funny thing is I punched it in google and got like no results...
2008-11-23T11:42:00.000Z	xtknight	Cr	ya the 2nd one looks like an ftp and those usually have the goodies.... u can recognize them
2008-11-23T11:43:00.000Z	Cr	xtknight	Thank you. I am going to try this and see if I can get eeebuntu to install and I will rejoin if it works hopefully :)
