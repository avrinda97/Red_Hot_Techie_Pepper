2010-09-17T03:50:00.000Z	uLinux		yes sebsebseb but I dont want to create a partition for /home like you said it's complicated
2010-09-17T03:50:00.000Z	uLinux		yes sebsebseb
2010-09-17T03:50:00.000Z	uLinux		im dual booting
2010-09-17T03:52:00.000Z	uLinux		without losing files
2010-09-17T03:53:00.000Z	uLinux		i think it belongs to NTFS partition
2010-09-17T03:55:00.000Z	uLinux		when the new Ubuntu version comes out how could I make a clean install without needing to make backup of everything
2010-09-17T03:55:00.000Z	tensorpudding	uLinux	a clean install implies that all the old stuff is removed
2010-09-17T03:56:00.000Z	uLinux	tensorpudding	not if I had a /home in another partition like sebsebseb said?
2010-09-17T03:56:00.000Z	tensorpudding	uLinux	that would allow you to save your personal files, yeah
2010-09-17T03:57:00.000Z	tensorpudding	uLinux	you'd reinstall normally, except being sure to tell it to mount your home partition, and telling it to not format said partition
2010-09-21T01:48:00.000Z	tensorpudding	uLinux	Yes.
2010-09-21T01:49:00.000Z	uLinux	tensorpudding	i have 1tb hdd but it's just i dont want to use like 4gb.. currently i have 5.6 with defaul installation
2010-10-28T21:53:00.000Z	tensorpudding	uLinux	You can run certain .NET applications with Mono.
2010-10-28T21:53:00.000Z	tensorpudding	uLinux	but only if they only use libraries that Mono supports
2010-10-28T21:54:00.000Z	uLinux	tensorpudding	i tried "sudo apt-get install mono" it's not in repos
2010-10-28T21:55:00.000Z	tensorpudding	uLinux	the package might not be called mono
2010-10-28T21:55:00.000Z	tensorpudding	uLinux	try grabbing mono-complete or mono-devel
2010-10-28T21:56:00.000Z	tensorpudding	uLinux	mono-runtime is probably needed for running Mono apps.
2010-10-28T21:56:00.000Z	uLinux	tensorpudding	it's installing mono-complete
2010-11-12T09:00:00.000Z	tensorpudding	uLinux	shift+insert is the best way, i find
2010-11-12T09:01:00.000Z	uLinux	tensorpudding	that pastes
2010-11-12T09:01:00.000Z	uLinux	tensorpudding	yes empty
