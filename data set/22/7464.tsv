2007-08-26T05:16:00.000Z	ja1		wailer-- that makes sense but i want to use the hd space from the ubuntu partition because the windows partition only have 1.2g left on it.
2007-08-26T05:16:00.000Z	ic56	ja1	you want to setup your machine so that it has a partition that is readable by both operating systems.   Windows cannot read Linux's ext3  and Linux cannot safely write to
2007-08-26T05:17:00.000Z	ja1	ic56	-- how do i do that?
2007-08-26T05:17:00.000Z	ic56	ja1	...write to Windows's NTFS.  The lowest common denominator is the DOS filesystem FAT and FAT32.  Both Windows and Linux can safely read/write that filesystem
2007-08-26T05:18:00.000Z	ja1	ic56	- but my win xp is installed using ntfs, how can i convert it to fat32
2007-08-26T05:19:00.000Z	ic56	ja1	Chances are that your Windows partitions (in Windows they're called "drives") are NTFS.  Chances are that all your Ubuntu partitions are formatted to contain ext3 filesystems.  Which means, you're out of luck.
2007-08-26T05:20:00.000Z	ic56	ja1	you will have to repartition to enable easy sharing between teh two OSs.
2007-08-26T05:20:00.000Z	ic56	ja1	of course, if the files are small enough, you could use floppies or even CD-RW
2007-08-26T05:20:00.000Z	ic56	ja1	or you could use the network -- upload the file to some server from Ubuntu, and re-download it from Windows.
2007-08-26T05:22:00.000Z	ic56	ja1	to my knowledge, there's no way to convert an NTFS filesystem to FAT32 -- you have to backup, re-format, and restore.  But, even if that were practical, you don't want to do that for
2007-08-26T05:22:00.000Z	ic56	ja1	Windows's boot filesystem because without NTFS a good chunk of Windows security won't work.
2007-08-26T05:23:00.000Z	ic56	ja1	you're welcome
2007-08-26T05:25:00.000Z	ja1	ic56	- how do i repartition? i want to give win xp drive more free space coz when i installed ubuntu, i gave it a lot of hd space and leave xp with just 1.2g. how do i get xp back some free space like 5g more?
2007-08-26T05:28:00.000Z	ic56	ja1	There is a tool for repartitioning but I have never used it. But when you undertake that kind of work, there is always the danger that you will lose data.  To be safe, you will want to backup your files first.
2007-08-26T05:29:00.000Z	ic56	ja1	did you get the message from ubotu about GParted?
2007-08-26T05:30:00.000Z	ja1	ic56	- i think its easier to uninstall ubuntu and let win xp reclaim all of the hard disk space, then make a clean install of ubuntu? what do u think?
2007-08-26T05:32:00.000Z	ic56	ja1	absolutely.  If ubuntu is a recent install and you have few or no personal files on it, by all means re-install.  However, I don't think that Windows can expand its partition.  Instead, you'll have to create a new FAT32 partition that you use for sharing.  You can do that either from Windows, or from the Ubuntu installer.
2007-08-26T05:33:00.000Z	ja1	ic56	-- how do i do this repartitioning with gparted
2007-08-26T05:34:00.000Z	ja1	ic56	-- thanks
2007-08-26T05:37:00.000Z	ic56	ja1	assuming you have just one disk, I think you want to end up with a disk partitionned like so: 1 NTFS partit (teh existing windows boot/root partit), 1 big FAT32 partit, 1 or 2 ext3 partits, 1 Linux swap partit.
2007-08-26T05:38:00.000Z	ja1	ic56	-- ok, i'll check out the gparted website and keeping my fingers crossed :D
2007-08-26T05:38:00.000Z	ic56	ja1	good luck.
