2011-01-15T07:00:00.000Z	fbnts		Hi, I am having trouble with an ubuntu system.  It has been compromised and every evening it floods my network.  I have tracked it down (ps -aux | grep perl) give the following
2011-01-15T07:00:00.000Z	fbnts		www-data 22967 70.2  0.1   3912  1520 ?        R    00:44  51:40 /usr/bin/perl ./x 74.208.13.197 6667 0
2011-01-15T07:01:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	remove that x file
2011-01-15T07:02:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	I would blow away your apache folder and try again, but if you want to track it down you probably can if you read that x script
2011-01-15T07:02:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	at the very least start by removing execute perms
2011-01-15T07:03:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	I'd like to see the script if you can post it somewhere
2011-01-15T07:03:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	absolutely not
2011-01-15T07:04:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	haha ok, yeah, your system's probably hosed if it's messing with /proc
2011-01-15T07:04:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	yeah that sounds more than a naive attempt, just format and reinstall, sorry
2011-01-15T07:05:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	the only backing up you should be doing is with a pen and paper
2011-01-15T07:05:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	clean the machine completely
2011-01-15T07:06:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	if you want to take the recordings somewhere isolated and put them back on the machine after a reinstall to see if they're corrupted, go for it, but you might need to reinstall a second time if your machine gets compromised again
2011-01-15T07:09:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	you could give it a shot, but I would expect a windows virus scanner to miss linux viruses almost certainly
2011-01-15T07:09:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	wait, is everything in /proc owned by www-data, or just that one process folder?
2011-01-15T07:10:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	oh that's normal
2011-01-15T07:10:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	yeah I'd like to see that folder, can you upload it somewhere?
2011-01-15T07:11:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	preferably somewhere it'll last for a couple days, I have to make sure my secure install is up to date before I unpack it there
2011-01-15T07:16:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	yeah ok, can you do a find / -user www-data as root?
2011-01-15T07:17:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	it looks like you didn't get everything, but maybe you did
2011-01-15T07:17:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	oh ok, guess some things are just empty
2011-01-15T07:18:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	alright well thanks, I'll take a look at this this weekend hopefully
2011-01-15T07:18:00.000Z	Adlai_	fbnts	see my pm
