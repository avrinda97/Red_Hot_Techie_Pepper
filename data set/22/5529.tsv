2007-06-15T13:56:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	what's the problem?
2007-06-15T13:56:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	and so? Why don't you just do it?
2007-06-15T13:57:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	Is the other PC a Windows machine?
2007-06-15T13:57:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	Why not use WinSCP on the Windows machine?
2007-06-15T13:58:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	it's bloody simple to install ...
2007-06-15T13:58:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	all that is needed is a valid login on the Linux PC and that's it.
2007-06-15T13:58:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	and a working openssh-server of course
2007-06-15T13:58:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	Wikipedia is your friend
2007-06-15T14:04:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	Host: Your Linux machine. Username: Your username on the Linux machine. Password: Your password on the Linux machine.
2007-06-15T14:04:00.000Z	BloodyTux	scorp123	now what?
2007-06-15T14:09:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	being able to read is bliss :-)
2007-06-15T14:10:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	it was all there ... just read the stupid address :-)
2007-06-15T14:10:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	That's more complicated ...
2007-06-15T14:11:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	Create a share on Windows ... then from Ubuntu you should be able to connect to it.
2007-06-15T14:11:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	each OS has its own mechanisms for connecting as you can see ....
2007-06-15T14:30:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	of course not
2007-06-15T14:30:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	WINE is just an emulation of sorts ... programs in there have no knowledge about your *real* hardware
2007-06-15T14:31:00.000Z	scorp123	BloodyTux	why not use something like "k3b" ??
