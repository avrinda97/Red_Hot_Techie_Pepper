2007-01-18T17:59:00.000Z	hydroxC		Hey, is there anyway of finding out what process is hosting on a certain TCP port ?
2007-01-18T06:00:00.000Z	JosefK	hydroxC	sure, netstat
2007-01-18T06:01:00.000Z	JosefK	hydroxC	netstat --program - if you want the owning program name included
2007-01-18T06:02:00.000Z	JosefK	hydroxC	at a guess it's connected to the Hewlett Packard printing daemons
2007-01-18T06:03:00.000Z	hydroxC	JosefK	Hmm.. it dosen't make sense. I disabled printer services when I installed ubuntu, to get rid of the open IPP... and I haven't installed anything since last port scanning myself.. it's just appeared
2007-01-18T06:03:00.000Z	JosefK	hydroxC	did it get dragged in with an update?
2007-01-18T06:05:00.000Z	JosefK	hydroxC	maybe an 'aptitude search hplip' ?
2007-01-18T06:05:00.000Z	hydroxC	JosefK	Ah. thanks. Think this will be as easy as removing a package ?
2007-01-18T06:05:00.000Z	JosefK	hydroxC	an 'i' at the start of a line means that package is installed
2007-01-18T06:06:00.000Z	JosefK	hydroxC	that just searches for it, you can tell if it's installed from there - after that, remove it like you normally would if it's there
2007-01-18T06:06:00.000Z	hydroxC	JosefK	Ahhhh, Thanks a bunch. The package you mentioned is installed
2007-01-18T06:07:00.000Z	JosefK	hydroxC	np's :)
2007-01-18T06:07:00.000Z	hydroxC	JosefK	Oh, not so good...
2007-01-18T06:07:00.000Z	JosefK	hydroxC	warning you about removing ubuntu-desktop?
2007-01-18T06:07:00.000Z	hydroxC	JosefK	When I mark it for removal in synaptic, -- yeah
2007-01-18T06:07:00.000Z	JosefK	hydroxC	don't worry, so long as it's just ubuntu-desktop, that's only a metapackage, no actual programs or data in it
2007-01-18T06:07:00.000Z	hydroxC	JosefK	Ahhh, alright
2007-01-18T06:08:00.000Z	hydroxC	JosefK	Removing...
2007-01-18T06:08:00.000Z	JosefK	hydroxC	it'll stop the daemon, but 'ps -ef | grep hpiod' to be sure
2007-01-18T06:09:00.000Z	hydroxC	JosefK	Yah. Just stopped it. You're too good at this :P. Thanks lots
2007-01-18T06:09:00.000Z	JosefK	hydroxC	np's again - have fun
2007-01-18T06:10:00.000Z	hydroxC	JosefK	Cheers, take care :)
