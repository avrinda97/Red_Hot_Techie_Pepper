2007-02-26T11:56:00.000Z	holly2hottie		 hey, I have a question... while running gnome on edgy w/ all the aviliable updates my Xserver seems to be closing completly and restarts for no reason at all there are no error messages or anything telling me whats going on either, is there anyone that can help me?
2007-02-26T11:57:00.000Z	h1st0	holly2hottie	what about the logs?
2007-02-26T11:58:00.000Z	h1st0	holly2hottie	does it do it randomly also or are you doing something when it happens like hitting ctrl+alt+backspace
2007-02-26T12:00:00.000Z	holly2hottie	h1st0	I am not hitting ctrl alt backspace. I am not sure which log files I would even need to look at to find out what to do about this either. But that useally is happening while I am in Firefox browsing the web in gnome. Right now I am in XFCE and I havent seemed to have had that issue yet. But its speratic, like sometimes w/in 3 min or starting GNOME sometimes like 1 - 2 hrs after starting GNOME
2007-02-26T12:02:00.000Z	h1st0	holly2hottie	hrm... well logs are in /var/log  like /var/log/Xorg.0.log etc...
2007-02-26T12:03:00.000Z	holly2hottie	h1st0	thanks, I will go and look at them now, I am not sure exactly what I am to be looking for so I will upload a copy to pastebin also and send the link to you
2007-02-26T12:03:00.000Z	h1st0	holly2hottie	the end of the file probably want Xorg.0.log.old or whatever the last one was.

2007-02-26T12:28:00.000Z	holly2hottie	h1st0	were you able to checkout my logfiles?
2007-02-26T12:29:00.000Z	h1st0	holly2hottie	yeah nothing really there. hrm...
2007-02-26T12:29:00.000Z	h1st0	holly2hottie	perhaps try different video drivers maybe is the only thing I would try to see if it goes away.
2007-02-26T12:31:00.000Z	holly2hottie	h1st0	hmmm... well any ideas? could it be a GNOME issue, or do you think it is something w/ X? Right now as far as video drivers I am using the default ones for my laptop. nothing fancy like the nvidea or radien drivers
2007-02-26T12:31:00.000Z	h1st0	holly2hottie	well you said you were running fluxbox also?
2007-02-26T12:32:00.000Z	h1st0	holly2hottie	if that restarts then its an Xorg problem not a gnome problem.  Or it could be hardware.
2007-02-26T12:33:00.000Z	holly2hottie	h1st0	not fluxbox xfce. and I havent had that problem yet on here, but my g/f is the one that has to use this and she kinda likes the feel and all of GNOME
2007-02-26T12:34:00.000Z	h1st0	holly2hottie	well if xfce isn't resetting the X server then I would assume it may be a gnome problem only.
2007-02-26T12:34:00.000Z	h1st0	holly2hottie	hrm....  The drivers shouldn't really matter but that may be worth a try.
2007-02-26T12:38:00.000Z	holly2hottie	h1st0	and ubotu: Thank you both for all your help and sugestions. I am going to check out the 3D-drivers as mentioned. How do I go about finding out exactly what video chip/card I have? I dont really have much of any info on the hardware on this laptop
2007-02-26T12:40:00.000Z	h1st0	holly2hottie	lspci | grep VGA
2007-02-26T12:40:00.000Z	holly2hottie	h1st0	thank you!!
2007-02-26T12:41:00.000Z	h1st0	holly2hottie	and btw ubotu is a robot not a real person.
2007-02-26T12:42:00.000Z	holly2hottie	h1st0	lol, the name looked fishy, but I tried to give the benifit of it being a real person, lol
