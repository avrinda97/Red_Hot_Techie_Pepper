2007-02-19T10:44:00.000Z	lmosher		After installing the latest kernel (.11) my X crashes. I'm pretty sure it's b/c my nVidia driver is not for the current kernel, but nvidia-glx says it's up to date. What gives?
2007-02-19T10:44:00.000Z	LjL	lmosher	you installed nvidia-glx from an external repository, didn't you?
2007-02-19T10:45:00.000Z	lmosher	LjL	Yes I'm using the beta driver from albertmilone.com. However, I installed via repo, so I would have expected it to update?
2007-02-19T10:45:00.000Z	LjL	lmosher	if it has been updated... are you sure it has?
2007-02-19T10:46:00.000Z	LjL		!nvidia9 | lmosher, these ones are updated anyway
2007-02-19T10:47:00.000Z	lmosher	LjL	I'll try that repo. If the driver hasn't been updated, why is it still crashing X on the new kernel? Oh it's probably the restricted modules
2007-02-19T10:47:00.000Z	lmosher		?
2007-02-19T10:47:00.000Z	LjL	lmosher	hm? if it *hasn't* been updated, then it's normal that X won't start
2007-02-19T10:47:00.000Z	LjL	lmosher	though it shouldn't "crash", it should just refuse to start
2007-02-19T10:48:00.000Z	lmosher	LjL	Yeah my terminology is incorrect, it just won't start. So basically if it hasn't updated (I'm checking that repo now) then I'll just need to wait until there is a new version?
2007-02-19T10:48:00.000Z	LjL	lmosher	yes. that's the flip side of using third-party repositories...
2007-02-19T10:49:00.000Z	LjL	lmosher	even the ones i've given above weren't updated during the first couple of days after the kernel update
2007-02-19T10:49:00.000Z	lmosher	LjL	yeah :/ Ohwell I can deal it's not like the new kernel had any changes I actually would notice.
2007-02-19T10:49:00.000Z	LjL	lmosher	keep in mind that, when the kernel gets an update, you can always still boot the old one
2007-02-19T10:50:00.000Z	LjL		!es | nchmilo
2007-02-19T10:50:00.000Z	lmosher	LjL	Hrm ok it is installing a new version of the linux restricted modules, so that might fix the driver, or no? There isn't an updated version of nvidia-glx...
2007-02-19T10:50:00.000Z	LjL	lmosher	it'll probably work, yes
2007-02-19T10:50:00.000Z	lmosher	LjL	Cool thanks.
2007-02-19T10:51:00.000Z	lmosher		Another question regarding kernel updates: Why does it re-set my grub menu list? I've organized it the way I like (i.e. my generic kernel first, then windows XP). After an update it deletes my windows listing. I'd rather is just add the new kernel options :/
2007-02-19T10:51:00.000Z	LjL	lmosher	hm, yeah, it does that
2007-02-19T10:52:00.000Z	LjL	lmosher	not sure there's any workaround (besides making a backup)
2007-02-19T10:53:00.000Z	lmosher	LjL	Ok, I can deal, I wasn't sure if I was doing something wrong in my menu.lst that made it get reset. It's no big deal it's just a little annoyance every time I update a kernel.
