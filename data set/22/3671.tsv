2009-01-03T10:49:00.000Z	rww	Mayank	what WebcamWonder said. Also, it might be downloading the 64-bit version, whereas you have the 32-bit version... or something like that.
2009-01-03T11:01:00.000Z	rww	Mayank	yes, clean install is better, albeit more difficult (sometimes)
2009-01-03T11:02:00.000Z	rww	Mayank	you have Ubuntu installed right now using the whole hard disk, and you want to install Windows XP as well?
2009-01-03T11:03:00.000Z	rww	Mayank	(just checking I understood you correctly before I link you to instructions)

2009-01-03T11:03:00.000Z	rww	Mayank	I've used the apcmag.com guides for dualbooting a lot, and they've never failed me :)

2009-01-05T13:56:00.000Z	rww	Mayank	how is it supposed to be connected to the internet? Ethernet? Wireless? Pastebin the output of lspci and lsusb...
2009-01-05T14:02:00.000Z	rww	Mayank	Does the PC connect to the internet okay in XP?
2009-01-05T14:02:00.000Z	Mayank	rww	yes.. perfect...
2009-01-05T14:03:00.000Z	rww	Mayank	okay. Open up a terminal and issue the command "lspci;lsusb", copy the output to http://paste.ubuntu.com/, and provide here a link to the created pastebin page.
2009-01-05T14:04:00.000Z	Mayank	rww	ok
2009-01-05T15:51:00.000Z	rww	Mayank	oops, sorry, that was useless. Fedora support in #fedora, not here. #ubuntu is, unsurprisingly, only for Ubuntu support.
