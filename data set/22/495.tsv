2011-09-10T20:12:00.000Z	escott	blsh0p	in that case you can use xrandr or the gui (its called "Displays" in the application search) to configure your second monitor

2011-09-10T20:16:00.000Z	blsh0p		there is a monitors, page, but it doesnt do anything
2011-09-10T20:17:00.000Z	escott	blsh0p	it is part of the system settings/gnome-control-center. not sure why it isn't showing up for you. you can use xrandr directly the commands are of the form xrandr -display DVI0 1280x1024 --left-of -display DVI1 1280x1024
