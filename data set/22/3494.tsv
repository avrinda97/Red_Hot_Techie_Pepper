2009-03-11T21:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb		you can have both
2009-03-11T21:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb		end of April
2009-03-11T21:18:00.000Z	tsolox	sebsebseb	that would be version 04.30 ?
2010-06-30T02:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tsolox	patched for use by Ubuntu
2010-06-30T02:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tsolox	its not a vanilla kernel
2010-06-30T02:57:00.000Z	tsolox	sebsebseb	can we use vanila kernel for ubuntu?
2010-06-30T02:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tsolox	you can install  your own kernel if you want to, but  support for that well not here, and maybe will cause a little upgrade issue if you upgrade Ubuntu
2010-06-30T02:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tsolox	also most users don't have a good enough reason to install their own
2010-06-30T02:58:00.000Z	tsolox	sebsebseb	last time i used ubuntu, it was able to mount a jfs partition. How do you suggest i go around this?
2010-06-30T02:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tsolox	uh why are you using jfs?
2010-06-30T02:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tsolox	hardly anyone uses that file system
2010-06-30T02:59:00.000Z	tsolox	sebsebseb	okey...how about xfs
2010-06-30T03:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tsolox	hardly anyone uses xfs or reiser or any of that with Ubuntu either,  its Ext4 by default since 9.10, and Ext3  before 9.10 by default
2010-06-30T03:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tsolox	and a year or so and it will be btrfs by default
2010-06-30T03:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tsolox	11.04 probably I mean
2010-06-30T03:00:00.000Z	tsolox	sebsebseb	it's a portable drive i attached to usb
2010-06-30T03:01:00.000Z	tsolox	sebsebseb	by 'hardly use it anymore', did you mean it is obsolete or what?
2010-06-30T03:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tsolox	jfs and xfs are still made as far as I know, but hardly any Linux users use them
2010-06-30T03:03:00.000Z	tsolox	sebsebseb	i think, mostly because ext4 has easier migration with their previous ext fs...
2010-06-30T03:04:00.000Z	tsolox	sebsebseb	but xfs came close to ext4 during Google's evaluation, i think
2010-06-30T03:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tsolox	apparantly XFS has had loads of the Ext4 advantages for well years
