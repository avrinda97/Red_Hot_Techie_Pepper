2009-03-27T15:50:00.000Z	BOE|Zack		Hello, I was wondering how I could safely mount my ntsf-3 drive?
2009-03-27T15:51:00.000Z	oCean_	BOE|Zack	see here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions
2009-03-27T15:53:00.000Z	BOE|Zack	oCean_	thats for the reply, I'll read into it.
2009-03-27T16:01:00.000Z	BOE|Zack	oCean_	would you happen to have a more up to date link. That diskmounter script doesn't exist anymore.
2009-03-27T16:02:00.000Z	oCean_	BOE|Zack	ow sorry... I know the link has (had?) a good explanation as how to use /etc/fstab
2009-03-27T16:03:00.000Z	oCean_	BOE|Zack	to mount a disk, you'll need at least an existing mountpoint (the directory where to attach the disk). Then you'll need to know the drive/partition name
2009-03-27T16:03:00.000Z	BOE|Zack	oCean_	not apposed to trying that just figured that diskmounter would be a safer option, so was just double checking.
2009-03-27T16:04:00.000Z	oCean_	BOE|Zack	well, using fstab file will mount the partition at every boot.
2009-03-27T16:05:00.000Z	oCean_	BOE|Zack	use "sudo fdisk -l" to list all your drives/partitions, then add a line to /etc/fstab file
2009-03-27T16:06:00.000Z	BOE|Zack	oCean_	okay thanks.
2009-03-27T16:15:00.000Z	BOE|Zack	oCean_	would this be correct: /dev/sda /media/hda ntfs ro,auto,user,fmask=0111,dmask=000 0 0
2009-03-27T16:16:00.000Z	oCean_	BOE|Zack	that seems fine indeed. Change "ntfs" in 3rd field to ntfs-3g (necessary for write access)
2009-03-27T16:27:00.000Z	BOE|Zack	oCean_	didn't end up working... is there a log where I can find out why?
2009-03-27T16:28:00.000Z	oCean_	BOE|Zack	what part did not work? The actual mount, or permission problems?
2009-03-27T16:29:00.000Z	BOE|Zack	oCean_	one second I'm looking through the mount -a
2009-03-27T16:36:00.000Z	BOE|Zack	oCean_	I got it to work. The problem was that it needed to be /dev/sda1 rather then /dev/sda
2009-03-27T16:37:00.000Z	BOE|Zack	oCean_	Thanks for the help. <:
2009-03-27T16:37:00.000Z	oCean_	BOE|Zack	ah, ok!
2009-03-28T05:11:00.000Z	oCean_	BOE|Zack	For write access, you also might want to use "ntfs-3g" as filesystem type
2009-03-28T05:12:00.000Z	BOE|Zack	oCean_	it is ntfs-3g
2009-03-28T05:12:00.000Z	oCean_	BOE|Zack	ok sorry, missed that part
2009-03-28T05:16:00.000Z	oCean_	BOE|Zack	the output states that it is mounted 'ro', which is readonly
