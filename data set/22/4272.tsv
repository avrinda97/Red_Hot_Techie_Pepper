2008-02-01T06:24:00.000Z	linxeh	exclampoint	why is that not fair? thats what you get for buying a cheap pc
2008-02-01T06:27:00.000Z	linxeh	exclampoint	I only use Linux or MacOSX now. Windows is too limiting for me
2008-02-01T06:27:00.000Z	exclampoint	linxeh	w/e
2008-02-01T06:28:00.000Z	linxeh	exclampoint	bear in mind that linux is different than windows. it takes a while to get accustomed to it

2008-02-01T06:30:00.000Z	linxeh	exclampoint	look at cedega and Crossover if you want to run windows software - many popular programs will run just fine. there are often free alternatives though that are as good, sometimes better, sometimes slightly lacking, but I don't think I'd go back to windows full time. I have to use it at work sometimes, and without cygwin I find it awful
2008-02-01T06:30:00.000Z	linxeh	exclampoint	counterstrike runs great with cedega apparently
2008-02-01T06:31:00.000Z	linxeh	exclampoint	what computer do you have ?

2008-02-01T06:31:00.000Z	linxeh	exclampoint	anything worthwhile is always hard
2008-02-01T06:32:00.000Z	exclampoint	linxeh	but i could have been fine w/windows but i guess i dont want to pay for pc repair and if cs works ok :)
2008-02-01T06:32:00.000Z	linxeh	exclampoint	well, you dont need to pay for pc repair. I built my own PCs from the age of 13 (I'm 29 now)
2008-02-01T06:32:00.000Z	linxeh	exclampoint	do you mean CS or CS:Source?
