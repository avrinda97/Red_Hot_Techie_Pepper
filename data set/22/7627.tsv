2006-07-23T11:44:00.000Z	No1Viking		I have a ATI Radeon 9800 card and installed fglrx according to the instructions in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto. Still I get OpenGL working only with software emulation instead of hardware. How do I fix this?
2006-07-23T11:44:00.000Z	farous	No1Viking	did you reboot after the installation
2006-07-23T11:45:00.000Z	No1Viking	farous	yes
2006-07-23T11:45:00.000Z	farous	No1Viking	and you installed the linux-restricted-modules package too
2006-07-23T11:46:00.000Z	No1Viking	farous	yes, that too
2006-07-23T11:46:00.000Z	farous	No1Viking	paste your xorg.conf file on the pastebin and the output of fglrxinfo
2006-07-23T11:47:00.000Z	No1Viking	farous	fglrxinfo is wrong
2006-07-23T11:47:00.000Z	farous	No1Viking	what do you mean by wrong
