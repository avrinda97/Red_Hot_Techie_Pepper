2008-10-05T12:22:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿Naomarik:  ubuntu doesn't include that for some stupid reason
2008-10-05T12:22:00.000Z	fenerli7		ok then, open that up
2008-10-05T12:22:00.000Z	fenerli7		it's the same thing
2008-10-05T12:23:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿Naomarik: the option is in "window decorations"
2008-10-05T12:24:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿﻿does anyone know why some apps suddenly start using the GTK1 theme?
2008-10-05T12:25:00.000Z	pvl1	fenerli7	bc they are coded with gtk1
2008-10-05T12:25:00.000Z	fenerli7	pvl1	no, they just changed all of a sudden. synaptic is an example
2008-10-05T12:26:00.000Z	pvl1	fenerli7	do u still have gtk2 installed?
2008-10-05T12:26:00.000Z	fenerli7		yes, all other apps are using it
2008-10-05T12:26:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿﻿pvl1: I think I got it, it seems to happen when I open programs as root
2008-10-05T12:27:00.000Z	pvl1	fenerli7	oh u mean just synaptic. oh well, it could be in the settings or what not
2008-10-05T12:27:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿pvl1: some apps, synaptic being an example
2008-10-05T12:27:00.000Z	pvl1	fenerli7	only as root tho
2008-10-05T12:28:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿﻿Naomarik: so it is set to emerald --replace? is it not using emerald?
2008-10-05T12:28:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿pvl1: yes, it's only as root, just tried with gedit
2008-10-05T12:28:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿Naomarik: can you try running emerald --replace manually, e.g. through alt-F2
2008-10-05T12:29:00.000Z	pvl1	fenerli7	must be the settings for root then. dunno how to fix that. there should be a config file for it
