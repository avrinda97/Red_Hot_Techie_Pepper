2012-09-28T08:36:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	your statement needs to be reworded, it isn't making much sense in english
2012-09-28T08:38:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	the command you need is cp.  cp will copy files from one location to another.
2012-09-28T08:38:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	I think I know what you mean
2012-09-28T08:40:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	the command would be similar to sudo cp /mnt/"hard drive name" /var/data
2012-09-28T08:44:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	you are on the right track.  have you mounted the hard drive?
2012-09-28T08:44:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	what is the mount point?
2012-09-28T08:45:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	it is probably mounted in /mnt or in /media .  can you check those directories to see if it is mounted there?
2012-09-28T08:47:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	can you give me the full mount path?
2012-09-28T08:48:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	you are correct.  the hard drive itself is listed in /dev, but it's not the same as the mount point
2012-09-28T08:51:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	if it is mounted, the mount point will be listed below the huge grey bar
2012-09-28T08:55:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	did you find it?
2012-09-28T08:57:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	so you will need to do the command sudo cp /media/de360cd5-d197-41da-a0d5-fc548f92a45f/var/data /var/data
2012-09-28T08:58:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	you may have to do sudo cp -r and then the command
2012-09-28T09:02:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	 the destination is your own /var/data, correct?
2012-09-28T09:03:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	or are you just wanting to copy that folder from the 2nd hard drive, to some new location on your hard drive?
2012-09-28T09:07:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	correct
2012-09-28T09:12:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	yes.  I've only had to deal with .htaccess a few times, it was a pain
2012-09-28T09:14:00.000Z	KBentley57	redwarriors25_	I can't really answer that.  All I did was google answers until i got it working :)
