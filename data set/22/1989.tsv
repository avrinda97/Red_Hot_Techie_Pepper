2009-11-23T01:52:00.000Z	hylian		does anyone have a command or app that cleans ubuntu's memory? (and yes it actually is neccessary, and really is a problem)
2009-11-23T01:53:00.000Z	maco	hylian	umm...reboot? that clears your memory
2009-11-23T01:53:00.000Z	hylian	maco	why should i reboot every time my machine's ram flls up and my system sows down, thats not a solution.
2009-11-23T01:54:00.000Z	maco	hylian	close whatever's using the memory?
2009-11-23T01:54:00.000Z	maco	hylian	rebooting is the only thing that will totally blank all the memory though
2009-11-23T01:54:00.000Z	hylian	maco	i did that. the memory is still filled.
2009-11-23T01:54:00.000Z	maco	hylian	you mean it refilled because you opened a bunch of large apps again?
2009-11-23T01:55:00.000Z	maco	hylian	have you considered that you simply need more memory if you want to run that many large applications?
2009-11-23T01:55:00.000Z	maco	hylian	for example, i simply could not get by on 512MB of RAM, since Firefox requires at least 600
2009-11-23T01:56:00.000Z	hylian	maco	i only run one of those at a time, never more than one at a time.
2009-11-23T01:56:00.000Z	hylian	maco	thats the other ting, io have 4 gigs of ram
2009-11-23T01:57:00.000Z	maco	hylian	are you remembering to subtract the cached mem from the used total?
2011-04-13T02:31:00.000Z	maco	hylian	did you use gdm to login? cuz then ctrl+alt+f1  "sudo service gdm restart" would do it
2011-04-13T02:32:00.000Z	hylian	maco	thank you man!
2011-04-13T02:41:00.000Z	maco	hylian	restarting the display manager didnt work?
2011-04-13T02:41:00.000Z	hylian	maco	no, it actually helped with something else, but no.
2011-04-13T02:43:00.000Z	maco	hylian	what happened when you restarted gdm? it didnt give you a login screen back?
2011-04-13T02:44:00.000Z	hylian	maco	because i am a man who doesn't fear being hacked, i have it set to auto login.
2011-04-13T02:44:00.000Z	maco	hylian	oooooooh
2011-04-13T02:45:00.000Z	maco	hylian	hmm wonder where you can set what the default login session is for a user...
2011-06-15T03:23:00.000Z	maco	hylian	try it in a VM and come back and tell us if it worked, hey?
2011-06-15T03:23:00.000Z	maco	hylian	but if you try it on your real system, you're gonna be crying
