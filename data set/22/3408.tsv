2008-09-13T20:40:00.000Z	SzalonyMjut		Hi all
2008-09-13T20:40:00.000Z	SzalonyMjut		I see in ubuntu are Add/remove and apt-get
2008-09-13T20:40:00.000Z	SzalonyMjut		whats is the different between both them?
2008-09-13T20:41:00.000Z	zoed	SzalonyMjut	apt-get is a command line utility and Add/Remove is a graphical easy-to-use interface for installing software. But not all software is available through Add/Remove
2008-09-13T20:42:00.000Z	SzalonyMjut	zoed	why not?
2008-09-13T20:43:00.000Z	zoed	SzalonyMjut	every application in Add/Remove has an image. But, for instance, the build-essential package doesn't have a picture.
2008-09-13T20:43:00.000Z	zoed	SzalonyMjut	But for almost everything you can find a suitable application in Add/Remove
2008-09-13T20:44:00.000Z	SzalonyMjut	zoed	so in graphical isn't pidgin-2.5.0, well i must install that by konsole?
2008-09-13T20:44:00.000Z	zoed	SzalonyMjut	Pidgin is installed by default! Applications->Internet->Pidgin Internet Messenger
2008-09-13T20:45:00.000Z	SzalonyMjut	zoed	yea, but ver 2.4.1 which one has problems with gadu protocole
2008-09-13T20:46:00.000Z	zoed	SzalonyMjut	I see your point. No, you can't install pidgin 1.5 by apt-get, since apt-get as well as Add/Remove use the same repository i.e. download the same software.
2008-09-13T20:46:00.000Z	zoed		!info pidgin
2008-09-13T20:47:00.000Z	SzalonyMjut	zoed	I see, there are bit different between gentoo and ubuntu ;)
2008-09-13T20:48:00.000Z	zoed	SzalonyMjut	 yeah, I see gentoo has the newer version http://gentoo-portage.com/net-im/pidgin.
2008-09-13T20:49:00.000Z	zoed	SzalonyMjut	of course, you can also grab the newest source code and compile that, but the question is if it integrates well with ubuntu
2008-09-13T20:50:00.000Z	SzalonyMjut	zoed	true, but i must have the newer ver., there are something like overlays in ubuntu?
2008-09-13T20:50:00.000Z	zoed	SzalonyMjut	If you want newest software, you can upgrade to Ubuntu Intepid (8.10) - but it is still the unstable dev version.
2008-09-13T20:51:00.000Z	zoed	SzalonyMjut	As far as I know, you can't add the intrepid sources and just install one intrepid package without doing a complete upgrade, but I'm not sure.
2008-09-13T20:52:00.000Z	SzalonyMjut	zoed	mhh at getdeb.net are the newer pidgin, can I install that from there?
2008-09-13T20:52:00.000Z	zoed	SzalonyMjut	You could try downloading the intrepid .deb from http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?searchon=names&keywords=pidgin and install it in hardy (no idea if that works)
2008-09-13T20:53:00.000Z	zoed	SzalonyMjut	the site I just named is the ubuntu repository, it would probably be better to download the .deb from ubuntu (which does have ubuntu-specific changes, but for intrepid) rather than a distor-neutral version.
2008-09-13T20:54:00.000Z	zoed	SzalonyMjut	Thats what I would do (if I needed the newer version)
