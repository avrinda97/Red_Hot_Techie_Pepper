2011-04-25T03:14:00.000Z	jord	erUSUL	 The switch? Nothing has changed as far as I am aware. Had a power outage this morning, turned it back on and now stuck at 10Mb/s.

2011-04-25T03:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	jord	i read that for « sudo ethtool -s eth0 speed 1000 » you fiorst have to turn off autonegotation
2011-04-25T03:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	jord	sudo ethtool -s eth0 autoneg on
2011-04-25T03:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	jord	sudo ethtool -s eth0 autoneg off
2011-04-25T03:19:00.000Z	jord	erUSUL	 turned auto negotiation off as you said, then ran sudo ethtool -s eth0 speed 1000 and I get "Cannot set new settings"
2011-04-25T03:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	jord	anything in « dmesg | tail -n20 » ?

2011-04-25T03:22:00.000Z	jord	erUSUL	the card reports as 8111/8168 but the driver is r8169, is that something?
2011-04-25T03:23:00.000Z	jord	erUSUL	updated these packages recently: http://paste.ubuntu.com/598455/
2011-04-25T03:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	jord	do not see anything related there; sorry.-
2011-04-25T03:24:00.000Z	jord	erUSUL	thanks for your assistance anyway
2011-04-25T04:23:00.000Z	jord	erUSUL	 Fixed it. I read somewhere that newer network cards have a "digital tuner" (whatever that means) and if you turn the computer off completely and leave for 10 mins it will reset. I did that and now it's working!
