2005-12-19T12:30:00.000Z	cafuego	XandriX	Yucky. Any chance you can swithc to ext3 and try again?
2005-12-19T12:30:00.000Z	XandriX	cafuego	reiser
2005-12-19T12:30:00.000Z	cafuego	XandriX	no, avoid reiser.
2005-12-19T12:31:00.000Z	cafuego	XandriX	Like the plague, even moreso than xfs.
2005-12-19T12:31:00.000Z	cafuego	XandriX	Why would you prefer a less stable fs over a more stable one?
2005-12-19T12:36:00.000Z	cafuego	XandriX	lilo has different, uglier bootsplashes. Check the manual for the 'bmp' display option.
2005-12-19T12:36:00.000Z	XandriX	cafuego	NO! not that
2005-12-19T12:37:00.000Z	XandriX	cafuego	when u load ubuntu when the kernel is loading and btw on all my boxes here lilo is faster then grub
2005-12-19T12:37:00.000Z	cafuego	XandriX	usplash then, not bootsplash.
2005-12-19T12:37:00.000Z	cafuego	XandriX	Just add "quiet splash" in the append= line
2005-12-19T12:38:00.000Z	XandriX	cafuego	do i need to put a vga= line ?
2005-12-19T12:38:00.000Z	cafuego	XandriX	Why would you do that?
