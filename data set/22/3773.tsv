2008-10-22T14:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	darren__	have you compiled a new kernel and want it adding to your grub list?
2008-10-22T14:49:00.000Z	darren__	ActionParsnip	 ok im new to ubuntu ill try and explain i have to download drivers from aircrack to work for packet injection on my wifi i had hardy version 24-19 i think and i reinstalled my pc with ubuntu 8.10 now i would like to be able to boot into the older version as well,  because the drivers were fine on that, does this make any sence
2008-10-22T14:51:00.000Z	darren__	ActionParsnip	so i would like to be able to have the both hardy and ubuntu 8.10 and pick one to boot into but the older version does not appear in synaptic any more to be able to install
2008-10-22T14:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	darren__	not sure, i think you'd need a dual boot sort of thing. I could be wrong
2008-10-22T14:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	darren__	does hardy work 100% for you?
2008-10-22T15:00:00.000Z	darren__	ActionParsnip	 now it does not its a shame i just would like to boot into kernal hardy 8.04 24-19 or 8.10 but thanks for the help
2008-10-22T15:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	darren__	you could install to usb to test it
2008-10-22T15:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	darren__	see if its better
2008-10-22T15:02:00.000Z	darren__	ActionParsnip	 true i just carnt remember what i did befor because i had 24-19 which updated to kernal 24-20 and i was still able to boot into the both√ß
2008-10-22T15:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	darren__	yes as they are both hardy kernels
2008-10-22T15:03:00.000Z	darren__	ActionParsnip	ok last question sorry to be a pain do you think there is any way of adding the hardy repositrys to the new ubuntu synaptic to be able to download the older kernal as well
2008-10-22T15:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	darren__	you could but i wouldnt recommend it
