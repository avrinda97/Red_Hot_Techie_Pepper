2011-06-01T07:15:00.000Z	shackletom		just directories
2011-06-01T07:15:00.000Z	shackletom		it even says so in the example
2011-06-01T07:16:00.000Z	shackletom		this is what the article says "For directories, the base permissions are (rwxrwxrwx) 0777 and for files they are 0666 (rw-rw-rw)."
2011-06-01T07:16:00.000Z	shackletom		i dont want 0666 for files
2011-06-01T07:16:00.000Z	shackletom		i want 0777 for files
2011-06-01T07:16:00.000Z	shackletom		umask doesnt seem to let me do this if im using it right
2011-06-01T07:17:00.000Z	shackletom		yes, and umask doesn't let me have x-permission on a file no matter what combination of numbers I use
2011-06-01T07:17:00.000Z	shackletom		Thats the problem
2011-06-01T07:17:00.000Z	shackletom		umask 000 does not give me rwxrwxrwx on files
2011-06-01T07:17:00.000Z	shackletom		only on directories
2011-06-01T07:19:00.000Z	histo	shackletom	777 would give you rwxrwxrwx
2011-06-01T07:23:00.000Z	histo	shackletom	what are the directories getting set at?
2011-06-01T07:24:00.000Z	histo	shackletom	and umask can't override the permissions specified by the program that creates the file or directory
2011-06-01T07:25:00.000Z	histo	shackletom	what are you trying to do exactly?
2011-06-01T07:28:00.000Z	histo	shackletom	if you are having issues with the values you can umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=r   and set it that way
2011-06-01T07:35:00.000Z	histo	shackletom	let me check something real quick
2011-06-01T07:37:00.000Z	histo	shackletom	what version of wine are you using?
2011-06-01T07:39:00.000Z	histo	shackletom	double check that version number doesn't see right
2011-06-01T07:39:00.000Z	histo	shackletom	I see a bug report in an old version that it wasn't honoring umask
2011-06-01T07:40:00.000Z	histo	shackletom	but their bug reporting is a mess so it's hard to tell
2011-06-01T07:40:00.000Z	histo	shackletom	how are you testing wether it's working?
2011-06-01T07:41:00.000Z	histo	shackletom	well you would set it then wine notepad or something and see
