2006-06-18T13:51:00.000Z	mlzs		Hey
2006-06-18T13:51:00.000Z	mlzs		I am having trouble with getting my ATI card's 3d acceleration up.. Can anyone help?
2006-06-18T13:53:00.000Z	mlzs		It simply will not work with the xorg-driver-fglrx package without more configuration, but I do not know how.
2006-06-18T13:54:00.000Z	mlzs		Anyone?
2006-06-18T13:56:00.000Z	mlzs		-_-
2006-06-18T13:57:00.000Z	mlzs		brb
2006-06-18T13:59:00.000Z	mlzs		mlzs@martin:~$ glxinfo | grep rendering >> direct rendering: No  || Please help \o/
2006-06-18T13:59:00.000Z	jrib	mlzs	what kind of card do you have?
2006-06-18T14:02:00.000Z	mlzs	jrib	Any idea what to do?
2006-06-18T14:02:00.000Z	jrib	mlzs	have you been linked to the docs?
2006-06-18T14:02:00.000Z	mlzs	jrib	This guide >>http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/hardware.html#video-acceleration-introduction
2006-06-18T14:04:00.000Z	mlzs	jrib	So, have I got the wrong guide?
2006-06-18T14:05:00.000Z	jrib	mlzs	other than the instructions for installing the ati driver there I don't know much about ati.  Those are the right docs to follow, maybe make sure every step went through alright one more time while you wait for someone more knowledgeable about ati
2006-06-18T14:05:00.000Z	mlzs	jrib	I ran the guide through three times, and nobody seems to want to help :|
2006-06-18T14:06:00.000Z	jrib	mlzs	when you reconfigured the xserver were you able to choose fglrx?
2006-06-18T14:06:00.000Z	mlzs	jrib	Nope
2006-06-18T14:07:00.000Z	jrib	mlzs	does 'apt-cache policy xorg-driver-fglrx' indicate that it is installed?
2006-06-18T14:07:00.000Z	mlzs	jrib	Yes
2006-06-18T14:10:00.000Z	jrib	mlzs	ok check that linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) is installed as well
2006-06-18T14:10:00.000Z	mlzs	jrib	It is.
2006-06-18T14:11:00.000Z	jrib	mlzs	not sure why dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg wouldn't give you it as a choice, have you tried doing it manually with the isntructions from wiki.ubuntu.com?
2006-06-18T14:12:00.000Z	mlzs	jrib	*
