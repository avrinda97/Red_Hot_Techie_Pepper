2006-09-18T10:09:00.000Z	quiet		it's on the same download page.. just down a little further.
2006-09-18T10:09:00.000Z	quiet		er...  debootstrap.   i don't think ubuntu supports that, but i dunno.
2006-09-18T10:11:00.000Z	quiet		use the gparted livecd.
2006-09-18T10:11:00.000Z	quiet		i've heard it works great... never used it myself.
2006-09-18T10:12:00.000Z	Samuli^	quiet	I've tried resizing with gparted few times and I always ended up with non-working partition and everything lost on that.
2006-09-18T10:12:00.000Z	quiet	Samuli^	with the most recent gparted livecd?
2006-09-18T10:13:00.000Z	Samuli^	quiet	dapper drake live.
2006-09-18T10:13:00.000Z	quiet	Samuli^	not what i was talking about.
2006-09-18T10:13:00.000Z	Samuli^	quiet	there's a gparted live-cd? Anyways. I wouldn't trust that program for resizing.
2006-09-18T10:15:00.000Z	quiet	Samuli^	i'll keep that in mind. thanks. Like I said, I've never used it. But i've had a couple people tell me it resized their NTFS without an issue.
2006-09-20T07:46:00.000Z	quiet	Samuli^	but apparently he has core 2 duo... as he said it has em64t

2006-09-20T09:38:00.000Z	quiet	Samuli^	SWAT is web based
2006-09-20T09:38:00.000Z	Samuli^	quiet	ok, I'll try that
2006-09-20T09:38:00.000Z	quiet	Samuli^	or System -> Administration -> Shared Folders
2006-09-20T09:39:00.000Z	quiet	Samuli^	but that's pretty limited
2006-09-20T09:39:00.000Z	Samuli^	quiet	yeah, can't use that.
