2008-12-22T15:39:00.000Z	terryx		ok...i have ubuntu.8.10 and my system keeps crashing mostly when i play movies...i have ejected my veido card(nvidia) because of this but no use...
2008-12-22T15:40:00.000Z	terryx		and one more thing i have installed ubuntu 2-3 times today but still noi use
2008-12-22T15:41:00.000Z	ceda_wrk	terryx	reinstalling doesn't normally help (like Windows)
2008-12-22T15:41:00.000Z	ceda_wrk	terryx	try using another video player and see if that hangs your compute rtoo
2008-12-22T15:41:00.000Z	ceda_wrk	terryx	players: mplayer, vlc, totem, xine
2008-12-22T15:42:00.000Z	terryx		tell me play who can handle subtitle like vlc
2008-12-22T15:42:00.000Z	terryx		my screen goes different like some colors and then hangs...
2008-12-22T15:43:00.000Z	terryx		And if i re-insert my nvidia card..how do i install its drivers..?
2008-12-22T15:44:00.000Z	terryx	ceda_wrk	tell me..?
2008-12-22T15:45:00.000Z	ceda_wrk	terryx	what codecs are you using? (try aptitude install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse)
2008-12-22T15:45:00.000Z	ceda_wrk	terryx	"like vlc"? I can use mplayer and vlc with subs without problems
2008-12-22T15:45:00.000Z	terryx	ceda_wrk	i don't understand, tell me steps plz..
2008-12-22T15:45:00.000Z	ceda_wrk	terryx	but if you find that mplayer plays the file and vlc doesn't, then the problem is vlc
2008-12-22T15:46:00.000Z	terryx		no the file plays but vlc close itself in some minutes..
2008-12-22T15:46:00.000Z	terryx		i can install mplayer from package manager
2008-12-22T15:46:00.000Z	terryx		?
