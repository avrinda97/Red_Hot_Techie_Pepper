2005-05-07T11:34:00.000Z	holycow		i would say totem-gstreamer is the right way and the future, totem-xine simply outperforms gstreamer today.  the gstreamer codecs don't seem to be able to decode efficiently (weren't the w32 codecs dervied from the original dlls or some such?)
2005-05-07T11:34:00.000Z	holycow		to stretch an analogy
2005-05-07T11:35:00.000Z	holycow		this whole discussion is moot
2005-05-07T11:35:00.000Z	holycow		your suggestin some strange and bizarre solutions to something that simply isn't free and never will be
2005-05-07T11:35:00.000Z	holycow		those codec haveto basically be purchase
2005-05-07T11:36:00.000Z	holycow		i don't see a problem with ubuntu offering a LEGAL player that has paid up whatever rights for the codecs and allow users to pay for them ...
2005-05-07T11:36:00.000Z	holycow		that gives those supporting ubuntu a real answ3er, for those that don't want to buy a legal player, they will find how to download this stuff anyway
2005-05-07T11:37:00.000Z	Ironfrost	holycow	- Ubuntu wouldn't offer a paid anything
2005-05-07T11:37:00.000Z	holycow	Ironfrost	why not?
2005-05-07T11:37:00.000Z	holycow	Ironfrost	that has nothing to do with it
2005-05-07T11:43:00.000Z	Ironfrost	holycow	- so, what if I invented a new algorithm for compressing video, for example
2005-05-07T11:43:00.000Z	holycow	Ironfrost	what about it?
2005-05-07T11:44:00.000Z	Ironfrost	holycow	- what you were saying about software patents
2005-05-07T11:45:00.000Z	holycow	Ironfrost	well imho, patenting ideas and software just shouldn't be done because it's all based on the work of others before you
2005-05-07T11:46:00.000Z	Ironfrost	holycow	- that's true with everything
2005-05-07T11:47:00.000Z	holycow	Ironfrost	*nod*
2005-05-07T14:34:00.000Z	holycow	Ironfrost	what? beer with your fries?
2005-05-07T14:34:00.000Z	Ironfrost	holycow	- yup
2005-05-08T10:45:00.000Z	holycow	Ironfrost	the interaction between users and computers is complex
2005-05-08T10:45:00.000Z	holycow	Ironfrost	there is a lot to be said for your point, but as well for having a 'secure by default' platform as well ... at least by design anyway
2005-05-08T10:47:00.000Z	holycow	Ironfrost	as funny as that is, it also happens to be true
2005-05-08T10:47:00.000Z	holycow	Ironfrost	lol, why?
