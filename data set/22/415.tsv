2011-10-17T04:41:00.000Z	Stacy__		I'm trying to install 11.10 with WUBI, but the installer doesnt look the same as all the tutorials. Specifically, it doesn't have the option to actually install inside windows. only reboot.
2011-10-17T04:41:00.000Z	edbian	Stacy__	installing with Wubi means installing inside wubi.  There is no option
2011-10-17T04:42:00.000Z	Stacy__	edbian	?
2011-10-17T04:42:00.000Z	edbian	Stacy__	wubi is always inside windows.
2011-10-17T04:42:00.000Z	edbian	Stacy__	If you're using wubi, you're installing inside windows
2011-10-17T04:42:00.000Z	Stacy__	edbian	mine WUBI installer doesnt look like this: http://www.ubuntu.com/sites/www.ubuntu.com/files/active/Installer.jpg
2011-10-17T04:43:00.000Z	edbian	Stacy__	What is different about how it looks?  (does it say 11.10 at the top like the picture?)
2011-10-17T04:44:00.000Z	Stacy__	edbian	this is what my installer looks like: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12195493/wubi.png
2011-10-17T04:44:00.000Z	edbian	Stacy__	mmm, what did you double click to open that window?
2011-10-17T04:45:00.000Z	Stacy__	edbian	yes
2011-10-17T04:45:00.000Z	Stacy__	edbian	i downloaded from: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/windows-installer
2011-10-17T04:45:00.000Z	edbian	Stacy__	what did you double click?
2011-10-17T04:45:00.000Z	Stacy__	edbian	wubi.exe
2011-10-17T04:46:00.000Z	edbian	Stacy__	That's curious: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide
2011-10-17T04:46:00.000Z	Stacy__	edbian	I just deleted and redownloaded it, now it looks like that. very. very. strange. Also I downloaded a .iso a day ago, and it had the same WUBI screen. But now, this 3rd and final download presents the screen in the tutorial. this is SSOOOO frustrating!!!!!
2011-10-17T04:47:00.000Z	edbian	Stacy__	the regular CDs have wubi on them
2011-10-17T04:48:00.000Z	edbian	Stacy__	trying to figure it out
2011-10-17T04:48:00.000Z	edbian	Stacy__	do you have teamviewer?
2011-10-17T04:49:00.000Z	Stacy__	edbian	no, but the third time i downloaded wubi it present the proper screeen & is installing now
2011-10-17T04:49:00.000Z	Stacy__	edbian	thank you though :)
2011-10-17T04:49:00.000Z	edbian	Stacy__	oh, yay :)
2011-10-17T04:49:00.000Z	edbian	Stacy__	sure, but I didn't do anything!
