2009-10-06T08:22:00.000Z	scunizi	Ben_90	ask a question and maybe someone will have an answer
2009-10-06T08:24:00.000Z	scunizi	Ben_90	open Synaptic Package manager and search for nvidia.. there are older drivers there.. also if you haven't done a complete system update it may not show up anyway.. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-10-06T08:25:00.000Z	scunizi	Ben_90	doesn't change anything
2009-10-06T08:26:00.000Z	scunizi	Ben_90	see my previous post
2009-10-06T08:28:00.000Z	Ben_90	scunizi	, everything went through just fine.
2009-10-06T08:30:00.000Z	scunizi	Ben_90	there's a driver in Synaptic Package manager called nvidia-glx-legacy that is designed for the tnt2.. install that
2009-10-06T08:31:00.000Z	scunizi	Ben_90	?
2009-10-06T08:38:00.000Z	scunizi	Ben_90	hang on
2009-10-06T08:40:00.000Z	scunizi	Ben_90	looks like they took it out of the Jaunty repositories.. you might have to get it direct from nvidia.. tricker to install that way.
2009-10-06T08:41:00.000Z	scunizi	Ben_90	http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_96.43.13.html
2009-10-06T08:49:00.000Z	scunizi	Ben_90	there's instruction on that page.. sorry can't help much beyond that.
2009-10-06T08:54:00.000Z	scunizi	Ben_90	I used google .. you can too.. read.. read. read.. a good start would be www.ubuntuforums.org
2009-10-06T08:55:00.000Z	scunizi	Ben_90	sure you do .. that's why you're here.. for others to tell you what to do. Just because your fingers are on the keyboard you want someone else to guide them
2010-01-10T21:46:00.000Z	scunizi	Ben_90	depends on the card..
2010-01-10T21:46:00.000Z	Ben_90	scunizi	, ikonia : it is an ati radeon sapphire 9600 pro 256mb
2010-01-10T21:47:00.000Z	scunizi	Ben_90	I have one of those.. ATI is not currently supporting it on Xorg 7.3+.. buy a cheap nvidia..
2010-01-10T21:47:00.000Z	Ben_90	scunizi	: damn :(
2010-01-10T21:48:00.000Z	scunizi	Ben_90	the nvidia 6000 series works very well and are probably dirt cheap
2010-01-10T21:49:00.000Z	Ben_90	scunizi	: i paid $33.90 for it when it was used.
