2006-08-28T06:24:00.000Z	tomlikestorock		does anyone know why my screen resolution would, after a reboot (with no changes being made in the last few days), limit itself to only 640x480?
2006-08-28T06:26:00.000Z	tomlikestorock		has this ever happened to anyone? You reboot and all of a sudden you're in 640x480 with no higher res?
2006-08-28T06:26:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	did you try doing an apt-get dist-upgrade?
2006-08-28T06:27:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	do you have dapper-updates in you apt repos?
2006-08-28T06:28:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	some people were having problems with a recent xorg update in dapper.. but it was supposidly fixed
2006-08-28T06:29:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	all you should have to do is sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-08-28T06:29:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	but if that did not work.. i'm not sure
2006-08-28T06:41:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	did ifup eth0 work?
2006-08-28T06:42:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	so trying "ping -c3 www.yahoo.com" gives you nothing?
2006-08-28T06:43:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	are you using a dhcp router?
2006-08-28T06:45:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	are you using wired or wireless/
2006-08-28T06:48:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	you can try rebooting.. or setting it up so that it is not static IP.. but i doubt that will help
2006-08-28T06:48:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	good
2006-08-28T06:49:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	ok.. what is the video card?
2006-08-28T06:50:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	I understand.. do you have proprietary drivers or xorg drivers?
2006-08-28T06:52:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	"gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" under Section "Device" it should say what driver you are using
2006-08-28T06:53:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	ok.. you are using the vesa driver
2006-08-28T06:54:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	that is more then likely your problem
2006-08-28T06:54:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	somehow you have two devices in your Xorg.. you should only have one
2006-08-28T06:54:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	the fglrx one
2006-08-28T06:55:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	probably an update wrote to your xorg file
2006-08-28T06:56:00.000Z	colb1	tomlikestorock	you shouldn't have to reboot.. just do "ctrl+alt+backspace" to restart the xserver
