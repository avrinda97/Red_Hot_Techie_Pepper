2007-05-28T12:28:00.000Z	crolle17		or is it impossible to configure the firefox-configuration?

2007-05-28T12:32:00.000Z	Slart	crolle17	if you really need a firefox expert, mozilla has it's own irc-server.. I think it's irc.mozilla.org
2007-05-28T12:33:00.000Z	crolle17	Slart	magnetron, want to know how to configure firefox, because the browser handles playing mp3 differently depending on the page.
2007-05-28T12:34:00.000Z	Slart	crolle17	I don't play mp3's in firefox so I wouldn't know.. have any example urls?
2007-05-28T12:36:00.000Z	crolle17	Slart	magnetron handling mp3 as i expected (opening a player): http://africanbeat.de/catalog/index.php?cPath=64  ; handling playing mp3 differently: https://www.soundquake.com/?page=shop/browse.php
2007-05-28T12:36:00.000Z	Slart	crolle17	I'll take a look.. brb
2007-05-28T12:37:00.000Z	crolle17	Slart	the second one seems to open a new page with a player...
2007-05-28T12:38:00.000Z	Slart	crolle17	both sites work the same on my computer
2007-05-28T12:38:00.000Z	Slart	crolle17	I think I've installed the firefox vlc plugin thingy
2007-05-28T12:38:00.000Z	crolle17	Slart	how did you configure the browser?
2007-05-28T12:38:00.000Z	crolle17	Slart	vlc package?
2007-05-28T12:38:00.000Z	Slart	crolle17	I haven't done anything special that I can remember..
2007-05-28T12:39:00.000Z	Slart	crolle17	there is a firefox vlc plugin.. a separate package
2007-05-28T12:44:00.000Z	crolle17	Slart	installed mozilla-plugin-vlc but didn't change anything.
2007-05-28T12:45:00.000Z	Slart	crolle17	restarted firefox?
2007-05-28T12:46:00.000Z	crolle17	Slart	yes. did a restart.
2007-05-28T12:47:00.000Z	Slart	crolle17	hmm.. odd.. well. the firefox plugin system for playing videos and mp3 etc is weird.. perhaps someone else knows more.. ask the room again
