2006-11-08T12:11:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy		actually, I heard nothing but positive results about ntfs-3g
2006-11-08T12:12:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy		has anyone heard of a ntfs-3g mishap?
2006-11-08T12:13:00.000Z	morphish	BHSPitLappy	same reason why people think they NEED a /home or a /usr or a /var
2006-11-08T12:14:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	morphish	/home is valid, this /boot isn't!
2006-11-08T12:15:00.000Z	morphish	BHSPitLappy	often people have a seperate /boot to keepp it umounted and thus not be affected by system crashes for example
2006-11-08T12:15:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	morphish	bah.
2006-11-08T12:16:00.000Z	morphish	BHSPitLappy	ok, so you disagree, no need to bah me when i try to explain why people like to have a /boot
2006-11-08T12:16:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	morphish	I'm bah'ing the idea
2006-11-08T12:17:00.000Z	morphish	BHSPitLappy	;P you might get another bah ready, i have used machines with a single / and swap before, just because i got tired of having free space where i didn't need them
2006-11-08T12:18:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	morphish	that's how my laptop is right now.
2006-11-08T12:18:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	morphish	for that reason, too.  My desktop has a /home, a /, a different / (for another distro), and a swap
2006-11-08T12:19:00.000Z	morphish	BHSPitLappy	having one home for 2 distros is where i would say having a /home makes sense
2006-11-08T12:19:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	morphish	exactly, that's the role it played on the desktop. although, that's not the only place it makes sense.
2006-11-08T12:19:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	morphish	it's nice having disposable OS partitions
2006-11-08T12:19:00.000Z	morphish	BHSPitLappy	serious? kubuntu had no issues with my /boot, just ignored the grub.conf and made a new menu.lst
2006-11-08T12:20:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	morphish	when I installed edgy, it demanded that any assigned /boot partition must be formatted.  So, what the heck good does that do, if I want to use multiple OS's with it?
2006-11-08T12:22:00.000Z	morphish	BHSPitLappy	the gui didnt work for me since / is hda7 (did some trickery with primary partitions to keep XP happy), the alternate cd installer took /boot just fine
2006-11-08T12:23:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	morphish	did it demand the /boot partition be formatted? The GUI installer stated it like a rule.
2006-11-08T12:24:00.000Z	morphish	BHSPitLappy	the gui states it like a rule, the alternate did what i told it to do and left it alone.
2006-11-08T12:24:00.000Z	morphish	BHSPitLappy	the funniest part on when people figure out how to partition a drive is: They spend more time thinking about it than it would take to install the OS
2006-11-08T12:24:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	morphish	well, my position is unchanged, as I already hated the GUI installer before. I just come to expect this from it.
2006-11-08T12:25:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	morphish	oh, I've spent lots of time planning and strategizing partitions.
