2007-10-23T23:22:00.000Z	so1		i tried to install the latest gpu driver with envy ...
2007-10-23T23:22:00.000Z	so1		it fails after "pyton pulse.py ati latest"
2007-10-23T23:23:00.000Z	youknowme	so1	Envy is bad news
2007-10-23T23:23:00.000Z	so1		because obviously pyton doesn't exist ...
2007-10-23T23:23:00.000Z	so1	youknowme	why?
2007-10-23T23:24:00.000Z	youknowme		!envy
2007-10-23T23:24:00.000Z	youknowme		!envy | so1
2007-10-23T23:25:00.000Z	youknowme	so1	ok, so what did it mess up?
2007-10-23T23:27:00.000Z	so1	youknowme	nothing at the moment ...
2007-10-23T23:27:00.000Z	so1		it just doesn't want to install my drivers ...
2007-10-23T23:27:00.000Z	so1		so where is the wiki?
2007-10-23T23:27:00.000Z	so1		or is 8.42.3 already in the wiki?
2007-10-23T23:27:00.000Z	so1		(fglrx)
2007-10-23T23:29:00.000Z	youknowme	so1	then whats your prob?
2007-10-23T23:31:00.000Z	so1	youknowme	i want to install 8.42.3
2007-10-23T23:32:00.000Z	so1	youknowme	and i look for a way to install it, either a wiki, or envy or something ...
2007-10-23T23:32:00.000Z	youknowme	so1	so you want to upgrade your driver?
2007-10-23T23:33:00.000Z	youknowme		so!, just use the restricted package manager..
2007-10-23T23:33:00.000Z	youknowme	so1	just use the restricted package manager..
2007-10-23T23:34:00.000Z	so1	youknowme	i think 8.42.3 isn't in there yet ...
2007-10-23T23:41:00.000Z	youknowme	so1	well, I don't know what to say. I can't rightly recommend envy, and nobody else in here is gonna help you with envy either... sorry :(
