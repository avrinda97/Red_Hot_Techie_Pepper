2009-03-03T07:54:00.000Z	Daremo		but when i run compiz here is what i get
2009-03-03T07:55:00.000Z	Daremo		you guys ready?
2009-03-03T07:55:00.000Z	Daremo		heheh
2009-03-03T07:55:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	wait
2009-03-03T07:56:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	anything larger than 3 lines must be sent to pastebin
2009-03-03T07:56:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	usually 3-5 lines
2009-03-03T07:57:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	we don't get a link :)?
2009-03-03T07:59:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	is 2560x1024 really your resolution?
2009-03-03T07:59:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	oh....
2009-03-03T07:59:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	well, I am fairly certain that is the line that is causing it to fail
2009-03-03T08:00:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	my laptop (which aslo has ATI) gets more errors than that but still runs
2009-03-03T08:00:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	however, the resolution error is the only one that it does not get
2009-03-03T08:00:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	I couldn't say for sure but it may be worth looking in to
2009-03-03T08:01:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	not sure, pull a monitor and check
2009-03-03T08:02:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	and IMO this is a lot of work for a couple useful features and bragging rights :\
2009-03-03T08:03:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	honestly, backup your xorg.conf first
2009-03-03T08:03:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	so atleast you know you have a working dual screen xorg
2009-03-03T08:05:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	ehh, I am really unfamilar with the whole "automagic xserver" thing and I have to say, I nearly despise it, I write my xorg.conf from hand using a xorg.conf.example
2009-03-03T08:11:00.000Z	Titan8990	Daremo	see, I would say that your not even using proprietary drivers, I really need to get familar with the automatic X and how it works
