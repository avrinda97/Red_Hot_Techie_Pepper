2007-04-13T07:15:00.000Z	mokchin	Daverocks	time to get Mark's ass here @ #ubuntu
2007-04-13T07:22:00.000Z	mokchin	Daverocks	absolutely. ;)
2007-04-13T07:22:00.000Z	Daverocks	mokchin	heh
2007-04-13T07:01:00.000Z	mokchin	Daverocks	but for home machines.. really someone is up his/her ass.
2007-04-13T07:02:00.000Z	Daverocks	mokchin	that's against my experience. when i ran a ssh server from my home network, i got tons of login attempts. this is even on a _dynamic_ IP.
2007-04-13T07:02:00.000Z	mokchin	Daverocks	surprising for a home network. umm..
2007-04-13T07:02:00.000Z	mokchin	Daverocks	what's the cracker gonna get ? pr0n ?
2007-04-13T07:02:00.000Z	Daverocks	mokchin	they were mostly from south korea and china
2007-04-13T07:03:00.000Z	Daverocks	mokchin	lol
2007-04-13T07:07:00.000Z	mokchin	Daverocks	you mean spoofed ?
2007-04-13T07:08:00.000Z	mokchin	Daverocks	that's really strange.
2007-04-13T07:11:00.000Z	mokchin	Daverocks	dooglus it was nice chat about security related stuff.
2007-04-13T07:12:00.000Z	mokchin	Daverocks	moving to the topic of Ubuntu now, how does Canonical make money off Ubuntu ? tech support ?
2007-04-13T07:13:00.000Z	Daverocks	mokchin	yep, that's one way
2007-04-13T07:13:00.000Z	mokchin	Daverocks	but I have hardly seen this question here and no one seems to have an answer to it
2007-04-13T07:14:00.000Z	Daverocks	mokchin	not sure :P
2007-04-13T07:21:00.000Z	mokchin	Daverocks	I actually got one of my friend today to use Ubuntu.
2007-04-13T07:22:00.000Z	Daverocks	mokchin	mm, and? do they like it? ;)
2007-04-13T07:22:00.000Z	mokchin	Daverocks	he was going oh is it really Free ? and I told him what I knew about GPL and Free software.
2007-04-13T07:23:00.000Z	Daverocks	mokchin	most people who i mention linux to, many of them have heard of it. something along the lines of "oh yeah, linux. how much does that cost again?"
2007-04-13T07:23:00.000Z	mokchin	Daverocks	i wish Ubuntu was here 5-10 years ago.
2007-04-13T07:24:00.000Z	mokchin	Daverocks	I mean Debian was always there but it really never took off that much I guess. I was switching back and forth between rh,slackware and debian but I found Ubuntu to be perfect match. ;)
