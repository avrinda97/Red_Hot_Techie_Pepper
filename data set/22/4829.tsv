2008-02-19T21:23:00.000Z	tabman	bazhang	ok Thanks let me just check that
2008-02-19T21:24:00.000Z	bazhang	tabman	wait and you can go to hardy in one step, starting late april
2008-03-02T16:45:00.000Z	bazhang	tabman	what is your issue?
2008-03-02T16:47:00.000Z	tabman	bazhang	I installed VirtualBox on ubuntu and put in Windows in the VM. Everything was working fine, I could access internet inside on windows in my VM. Just suddenly the internet has stopped working in it ?
2008-03-02T16:47:00.000Z	bazhang	tabman	bridged or nat?
2008-03-02T16:47:00.000Z	tabman	bazhang	NAT
2008-03-02T16:48:00.000Z	bazhang	tabman	and the internet is fine on your ubuntu box still?
2008-03-02T16:48:00.000Z	tabman	bazhang	I'm on Ubuntu right now using that same internet connection, my VM is just not accessing the internet
2008-03-02T16:49:00.000Z	bazhang	tabman	not used vbox much  I prefer vmware--have you tried restarting the guest os or shutting it down restarting in vbox?
2008-03-02T16:50:00.000Z	tabman	bazhang	I tried every damn thing, restarted VM, restarted Ubuntu, it was working 2 hours back, it just suddenly stopped working and I did not even install anything or change anything
2008-03-02T16:51:00.000Z	bazhang	tabman	that is very odd--not sure what to say let me check the forums,,hold on a sec
2008-03-02T16:55:00.000Z	bazhang	tabman	is this a static ip for the guest os or dynamic? is the xp system trying to get dns automatically or are you assigning it--two issues that I have seen others in the forums with--if you cannot find an answer they also have a channel #vbox
2008-03-02T16:55:00.000Z	tabman	bazhang	I don't know what type IP it is
2008-03-02T16:56:00.000Z	bazhang	tabman	well you can take a look and set it in the preferences if I recall correctly may be worth a look
2008-03-02T16:56:00.000Z	tabman	bazhang	but I'm not specially giving anything to xp, I just setup using the "home network" thing
2008-03-02T16:56:00.000Z	tabman	bazhang	look what and set what ?
2008-03-02T16:57:00.000Z	bazhang	tabman	well he default behaviour is for it do it on its own you should tell it not to--here is the thread I have been reading it may or may not help: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-599163.html
2008-03-02T17:05:00.000Z	tabman	bazhang	somehow it has worked, I don't know why it was working without it since last 5 days :) by the way what search query did you use to get this result ?
2008-03-02T17:06:00.000Z	bazhang	tabman	hehe good news! I just typed ubuntu gutsy virtualbox no internet guest xp (in teh google) and there you have it ;]
2008-03-02T17:06:00.000Z	tabman	bazhang	thanks a lot man
2008-03-02T17:07:00.000Z	bazhang	tabman	no worries ;]
