2005-04-20T12:33:00.000Z	MMond		I'm misunderstanding something, and I'd be [grateful]  if anyone can help me understand something
2005-04-20T12:33:00.000Z	MMond		People told me that I can't use php5 . . . can't remember the exact reason, but . . .
2005-04-20T12:34:00.000Z	MMond		Well, whatever it was . . . so is that how distos are differentiated? I think I've taken Linux to be a lot easier than what it is
2005-04-20T12:34:00.000Z	MMond		!ping
2005-04-20T12:34:00.000Z	MMond		Woah, i can?
2005-04-20T12:35:00.000Z	MMond		Hmm, I don't know . . . I was told by someone I could, that the packages are not.. compiled, or something . . . I'm not sure. I'm a Linux nub, started using Ubuntu 2 weeks ago
2005-04-20T12:37:00.000Z	MMond		So . . . I should meet no problems of that sort . . . that when there's some source file . . . whatever it is, I can unpack it - compile it - and install it, regardless of what distro - just that it is linux?
2005-04-20T12:38:00.000Z	BazziE	MMond	not exactly regardless what distro
2005-04-20T12:39:00.000Z	MMond	BazziE	Now that I'm surfing for files.. I usually see the source.. rpm package.. apt packages.. for the source, what can be caused that would mess things up?
2005-04-20T12:40:00.000Z	BazziE	MMond	well, distribution authors change the packages/sources to compile to places etc they want, so you might run into the problem, that you dont get stuff where you have it usually.
2005-04-20T12:43:00.000Z	BazziE	MMond	yep, think of it like win95 sues windows/system and win nt uses windows/system32 as directories and so on. Also with config etc :)
2005-04-20T12:51:00.000Z	BazziE	MMond	if you want a controllable php system you have to compile from source anyway.
2005-04-20T12:51:00.000Z	BazziE	MMond	I dont recommend using the packages for anything other than testing
2005-04-20T12:53:00.000Z	BazziE	MMond	do you use your system productively or do you have a dedicated linux playground you can bork?
2005-04-20T12:54:00.000Z	MMond	BazziE	I'm on a 266 mhz laptop.. I originally wanted to work with php, and initally I was told by someone to get linux, work locally with servers to attain a better understanding . . . so I'm simply playing around and testing for the most parts
2005-04-20T12:55:00.000Z	BazziE	MMond	then you can just go ahead and try to compile everything yourself, learning by doing does more harm but gets you quicker learning results if you do it right
2005-04-20T12:56:00.000Z	MMond	BazziE	Any guide out there dedicated solely to these things - basics of compiling, and what to worry when compiling common things?
2005-04-20T12:57:00.000Z	BazziE	MMond	I havent used one guide myself, I just tried ;) I can help you with the very basics
2005-04-20T12:58:00.000Z	MMond	BazziE	So far . . . the guide that has helped by far the most was probably http://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/ covered everything really well :D . . . tldp.org, I think I can trust it for most of help
2005-04-20T12:59:00.000Z	BazziE	MMond	hey I even ahd to compile a kernel module myself to get wlan working in the first place ;-)
2005-04-20T13:00:00.000Z	MMond	BazziE	Currently, lots of people have told me to recompile my kernel.. have been having some acpi problems . . . currently, my battery is not working, floppy drive not working, sound not working.. and a couple of few things. As of this time, I've just decided to not mind it . . . and maybe settle them when I have a better understanding of Linux
2005-04-20T13:01:00.000Z	BazziE	MMond	usually you dont need to compile the whole kernel, just modules.
