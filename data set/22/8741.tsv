2005-07-10T16:40:00.000Z	chez		*to it
2005-07-10T14:23:00.000Z	chez		can someone PLEASE help me out with my pen drive I can't write to it as or chmod it despite being the owner and the permissions being 700 - someone said I way have to change my hotplug settings - no idea how to do that
2005-07-10T14:24:00.000Z	prego	chez	check the thing has not a switch
2005-07-10T14:24:00.000Z	prego	chez	a lock I mean...
2005-07-10T14:27:00.000Z	chez	prego	it does have a lock - but when the lock is on it on't let me make any changes to the pendrive. When the lock is off I can drag stuff into the drive and add documents etc but the next time I unplug/plug it in the things I added won't be there
2005-07-10T14:27:00.000Z	prego	chez	are you unmounting the volume or just taking it off??????
2005-07-10T14:28:00.000Z	chez	prego	just pulling the pen drive out - thought it would unmount automatically
2005-07-10T14:28:00.000Z	prego	chez	no!
2005-07-10T14:28:00.000Z	prego	chez	unless you specify proper options at mounting
2005-07-10T14:28:00.000Z	chez	prego	well that lame :)
2005-07-10T14:28:00.000Z	prego	chez	if you add a file and remove it quickly, the OS does nothing...
2005-07-10T14:29:00.000Z	chez	prego	I fugure it may be some thing like that
2005-07-10T14:29:00.000Z	prego	chez	please note that you have the "unmount volume" at the contextual menu on the device icon at the desktop
2005-07-10T14:30:00.000Z	prego	chez	same applies to old disc drives...
2005-07-10T14:30:00.000Z	chez	prego	so computer > usbdsk> right clcik unmount voume
2005-07-10T14:31:00.000Z	chez	prego	right?
2005-07-10T14:31:00.000Z	prego	chez	don't you see a desktop icon for the usb disk?
2005-07-10T14:31:00.000Z	chez	prego	yeah - I can just unm0ount it there can't I
2005-07-10T14:32:00.000Z	prego	chez	I do that from the desktop icon, but perhaps you can do it elsewhere
2005-07-10T14:32:00.000Z	prego	chez	you may need to close any terminals which are "inside" the pendrive and probably any nautilus windows...
2005-07-10T14:33:00.000Z	chez	prego	cheers working fine now
