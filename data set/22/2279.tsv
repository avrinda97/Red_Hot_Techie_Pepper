2010-05-04T01:47:00.000Z	aaron11		I cant see the Purple Ubuntu Plymouth on booting Ubuntu Lucid Lynx. Does this hapen to anyone else? Please help.
2010-05-04T01:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	aaron11	which card?
2010-05-04T01:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	aaron11	What do you see?
2010-05-04T01:49:00.000Z	aaron11	sebsebseb	Just a grey line blinking and after a few secs some text
2010-05-04T01:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	aaron11	Ok which graphics card?
2010-05-04T01:49:00.000Z	aaron11	sebsebseb	ATI
2010-05-04T01:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	aaron11	Have you installed the propritary driver?
2010-05-04T01:50:00.000Z	aaron11	sebsebseb	... Lemmy check
2010-05-04T01:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	aaron11	If so that could be causing your issue
2010-05-04T01:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	aaron11	depending on which driver it is I guess
2010-05-04T01:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	aaron11	basically loads of us are getting Plymouth boot up issues, after having propritary Nivida or ATI driver installed
2010-05-04T01:51:00.000Z	aaron11	sebsebseb	It doesnt list any in "Hardware Drivers
2010-05-04T01:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	aaron11	however your issue sounds a bit differnet
2010-05-04T01:52:00.000Z	aaron11	sebsebseb	It doesnt list any in "Hardware Drivers
2010-05-04T01:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	aaron11	so it's a bar that moves on the bottom of the screen when loading is it?
2010-05-04T01:53:00.000Z	aaron11	sebsebseb	No. Its a short grey line blinking at the top left corner for some secs after some time some text apears
2010-05-04T01:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	aaron11	after what I have seen
2010-05-04T01:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	aaron11	some serious Plymouth issues
2010-05-04T01:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	aaron11	well  if you had seen what I had seen,  you would be rather thankful, to be getting what your getting, even though it's not what your meant to be getting really
2010-05-04T01:54:00.000Z	aaron11	sebsebseb	But boots up perfectly fast. 15 seconds
2010-05-04T01:55:00.000Z	aaron11	sebsebseb	But when halting the Plymouth apears
