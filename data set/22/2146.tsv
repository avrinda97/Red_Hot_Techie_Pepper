2009-09-16T20:17:00.000Z	Tamale		hi, when I put a DVD-RW in my cdrom drive, I get an error that says "Cannot mount volume. You are not privileged to mount the volume <cd name>"..  how do I fix this so I can wipe the dvd and burn a new iso to it?
2009-09-16T20:18:00.000Z	johnT	Tamale	try mounting with sudo
2009-09-16T20:18:00.000Z	Tamale	johnT	How would I do that?
2009-09-16T20:19:00.000Z	johnT	Tamale	for example,    sudo mount /dev/sr0
2009-09-16T20:20:00.000Z	johnT	Tamale	do you use brasero? then sudo brasero should fix ;)
2009-09-16T20:21:00.000Z	Tamale	johnT	Thanks.. it looks like it's working.  I'm just frustrated that you have to use sudo just to use your cdrom drive.  It's not a pretty user experience.
2009-09-16T20:25:00.000Z	Tamale	johnT	well, luck shouldn't have anything to do with it.  You shouldn't need to be root just to burn a dvd
2009-09-16T20:26:00.000Z	Tamale	johnT	but maybe I'm having especially bad luck.. like I said, it's still not working, not even as root.  The blank command supposedly worked, but it's still 'creating image checksum'
2009-09-16T20:27:00.000Z	johnT	Tamale	sudo gedit /etc/fstab      -   pastebin it

2009-09-16T20:31:00.000Z	johnT	Tamale	modify this line         /dev/scd0 /media/cdrom0 udf,iso9660 noauto 0 0    into          /dev/scd0 /media/cdrom0 udf,iso9660,users,auto 0 0
2009-09-16T20:31:00.000Z	johnT	Tamale	no, also added 'users' option
2009-09-16T20:33:00.000Z	Tamale	johnT	ok, changes made.  Do I have to reboot?
2009-09-16T20:33:00.000Z	johnT	Tamale	no, no reboot. simply close brasero, eject the cd and then repeat the operation
2009-09-16T20:34:00.000Z	johnT	Tamale	this settings will allow mounting the cd\dvd without root permissions
2009-09-16T20:34:00.000Z	johnT	Tamale	well, I don't think so. My default line for dvd drive not only includes 'users' option, but also utf-8
2009-09-16T20:35:00.000Z	johnT	Tamale	utf8, not utf-8
2009-09-16T20:35:00.000Z	Tamale	johnT	Interesting.. I've never changed mine.
2009-09-16T20:35:00.000Z	johnT	Tamale	check if this config works as desired
2009-09-16T20:36:00.000Z	johnT	Tamale	sudo nautilus /media     check cdrom0 directory permissions
2009-09-16T20:37:00.000Z	johnT	Tamale	just a typing error
2009-09-16T20:38:00.000Z	johnT	Tamale	the correct line should be /dev/scd0 /media/cdrom0 udf,iso9660 users,noauto 0 0        my mistake
