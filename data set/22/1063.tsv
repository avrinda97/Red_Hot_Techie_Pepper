2010-10-24T01:50:00.000Z	amarcolino	rammyIRC	the mount point would be /media however if you're doing it through nautilus you don't need to go their as it would have it on the left side as a hd
2010-10-24T01:50:00.000Z	rammyIRC		okay i will check
2010-10-24T01:51:00.000Z	amarcolino	rammyIRC	is the partition actually mounted you can sudo fidsk -l to check which drive partition is your windows
2010-10-24T01:52:00.000Z	rammyIRC	amarcolino	i did use tht to se the partions
2010-10-24T01:53:00.000Z	rammyIRC		but i dont know how to mount the partitions into the linux
2010-10-24T01:54:00.000Z	amarcolino	rammyIRC	if the partition aint mounted you can always do it manually through - sudo mkdir /media/windows | sudo mount /dev/sd* (drive which belongs to your windows) most of the times you wont need to use the -t option for the file format unless needed
