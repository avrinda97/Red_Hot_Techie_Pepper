2007-01-09T11:43:00.000Z	adaptr	chaks	what does your package manager say about the state of pygtk ?
2007-01-09T11:44:00.000Z	chaks	adaptr	this is what i get - "python-gtk2 is already the newest version."
2007-01-09T11:44:00.000Z	chaks	adaptr	and this while running apps - "ImportError: PyGTK requires PyGObject 2.11.1 or higher, but (2, 10, 1) was found"
2007-01-09T11:45:00.000Z	adaptr	chaks	did you run apt-get -force ? you can force it to re-install
2007-01-09T11:47:00.000Z	chaks	adaptr	am not getting the syntax, can you provide it :(
2007-01-09T11:47:00.000Z	adaptr	chaks	I'll see, wait a sec
2007-01-09T11:49:00.000Z	adaptr	chaks	what does dpkg -l python-gtk2 show ?
