2010-09-11T18:00:00.000Z	help-seeker-1_	glebihan	i did, but i do not know what to do with it then
2010-09-11T18:00:00.000Z	glebihan	help-seeker-1_	ok, hold on, I'll have a look at it
2010-09-11T18:01:00.000Z	help-seeker-1_		thanks!
2010-09-11T18:03:00.000Z	glebihan	help-seeker-1_	from the folder where you extracted the content of the ".tar.gz" file run "./autogen.sh"

2010-09-11T18:04:00.000Z	help-seeker-1_	glebihan	i tried that and then ran make, but i got errors as well... what should happen if i ran autogen?
2010-09-11T18:05:00.000Z	glebihan	help-seeker-1_	what error did you get ?
2010-09-11T18:05:00.000Z	help-seeker-1_	glebihan	wait, i'll do it again
2010-09-11T18:08:00.000Z	help-seeker-1_	glebihan	i extracted now to a different folder than last time, now the error message is different (comes up already on autogen-call): configure: error: no C Sharp compiler: mcs not found in $PATH  -- shall i extract the downloaded archive somewhere else? last time i extracted it to the folder i checked out with "bzr branch http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~csights/+junk/simias/"
2010-09-11T18:08:00.000Z	glebihan	help-seeker-1_	sudo apt-get install mono-mcs
2010-09-11T18:09:00.000Z	help-seeker-1_	glebihan	ok, now i get "configure: error: gconftool-2 executable not found in your path - should be installed with GConf"
2010-09-11T18:10:00.000Z	help-seeker-1_		ok, gconf2 installed
2010-09-11T18:10:00.000Z	help-seeker-1_		it continues
2010-09-11T18:10:00.000Z	glebihan	help-seeker-1_	ok
2010-09-11T18:12:00.000Z	help-seeker-1_	glebihan	it finished, but it seems there are still problems: http://pastebin.com/ETeztqHu   -- something wrong with the extract location? i didn't use anything of the things that came from "bzr branch http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~csights/+junk/simias/"
2010-09-11T18:14:00.000Z	glebihan	help-seeker-1_	nothing to do with the extract location, you should probably install this (https://sourceforge.net/projects/ifolder/files/iFolder%20Clients/3.8.0.3/simias.tar.gz/download) first
