2012-06-10T07:06:00.000Z	duder123		hey I'm having a pain of a time trying to boot into the Ubutnu 12.04 live cd to get the install running
2012-06-10T07:06:00.000Z	duder123		I've butnt it from ISO
2012-06-10T07:06:00.000Z	duder123		verified the disk, and then even tested that it boots in a VM that's fine
2012-06-10T07:06:00.000Z	duder123		but when I go to boot the actual cd on this machine it's screwed
2012-06-10T07:07:00.000Z	duder123		it basically loads the screen with thelogo then goes to a black screen with a flashing "_"
2012-06-10T07:07:00.000Z	duder123		and it sits and flashed FOARVARRRR
2012-06-10T07:08:00.000Z	ravi	duder123	 did u try other options from boot options?
2012-06-10T07:09:00.000Z	duder123	ravi	I don't get that far
2012-06-10T07:12:00.000Z	ravi	duder123	 when u put the cd in the drive and boot the computer then hold down arrow key and it would give u options
2012-06-10T07:12:00.000Z	duder123	ravi	what arrow key?
2012-06-10T07:12:00.000Z	duder123	ravi	<--?
2012-06-10T07:13:00.000Z	ravi	duder123	: keyboard down arrow key
2012-06-10T07:14:00.000Z	duder123	ravi	ok I'll try that
2012-06-10T07:14:00.000Z	duder123	ravi	what option is the best for this problem?
2012-06-10T07:15:00.000Z	duder123	ravi	ok I got the menu - I'll try a few options here - thanks!
2012-06-10T07:19:00.000Z	duder123	ravi	I've just tried about all of the options and it still won't boot into them
2012-06-10T07:20:00.000Z	duder123	ravi	the test memory option works
2012-06-10T07:20:00.000Z	duder123	ravi	and memory seems fine
2012-06-10T07:20:00.000Z	duder123	ravi	all the others go to a flashing _
2012-06-10T07:20:00.000Z	ravi	duder123	:  then I cant say much ... is ur cd drive and written data fine on disk?
2012-06-10T07:21:00.000Z	duder123	ravi	yeah I checked that, I can boot into it by reading the physical disk into a virtual machine
2012-06-10T07:21:00.000Z	duder123	ravi	over vmware
