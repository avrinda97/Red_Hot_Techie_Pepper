2007-09-22T07:21:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Photocopy	sorry, not my area
2007-09-22T07:16:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Photocopy	mostly it's automatic, maybe through udev?
2007-09-22T07:19:00.000Z	Photocopy	jimcooncat	how do i run this?
2007-09-22T07:20:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Photocopy	it's nothing to run, you have to have the right device driver loaded into it for your gizmo
2007-09-22T07:21:00.000Z	Photocopy	jimcooncat	you know how most hardware detection things can find the model of the hhardware? I cant get a driver without knowing what sound card i have
2007-09-22T07:22:00.000Z	Photocopy	jimcooncat	nothing is anybody's area anymore
2007-09-22T07:22:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Photocopy	what kind of hardware?
2007-09-22T07:22:00.000Z	Photocopy	jimcooncat	a soundcard, i cannot get any more specific than that cause i dont know WHAT soundcard
2007-09-22T07:24:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Photocopy	since it didn't register automatically, you'd have to know the model. If there's no stamp on the metal part that's showing, then you'd have to take it apart and hope it says on the card somewhere
2007-09-22T07:25:00.000Z	Photocopy	jimcooncat	screw that im moving off xubuntu to something else that is so skilled as to detect my hardware
2007-09-22T07:25:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Photocopy	if you got Windows on that computer you can run a full scandisk instead
2007-09-22T07:29:00.000Z	Photocopy	jimcooncat	i dont have windows
