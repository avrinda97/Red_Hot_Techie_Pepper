2007-12-07T10:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	ask your question..
2007-12-07T10:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	what in particular are you having trouble wiht
2007-12-07T10:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	are you trying to dual boot?
2007-12-07T10:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	fine.. I dual boot here too..
2007-12-07T10:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	If you manually created the ext3 (or other) it would work better if you made it smaller and left unallocated space for the installer to do it on its own
2007-12-07T10:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	you will have an extra ext3.. which we will use
2007-12-07T10:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	partition magic is fine.
2007-12-07T10:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	is that 20 for xp or for Ubuntu
2007-12-07T10:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	what about swap space?
2007-12-07T10:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	can you get to xp.?
2007-12-07T10:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	fdisk /mbr     will get you back into windows...  use partition magic and delete the linux partition... boot live and let ubuntu set it up
2007-12-07T10:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	are you running livecd now
2007-12-07T10:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	do you have a boot floppy?
2007-12-07T10:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	booting live, does that cd offer an option to boot the hard drive?
2007-12-07T10:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	fdisk -l      small l   in a cli
2007-12-07T10:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	terminal window
2007-12-07T10:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	  sorry  sudo fdisk -l
2007-12-07T10:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	cut and paste requires Shift Key
2007-12-07T10:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	navynewyorker	I dont have time to troubleshoot grub atm..   someone may be able to help.. or boot xp cd into recovery mode and do fdisk /mbr   not to be confused with terminal or cli command line interface.. sorry.  Just getting tired.
