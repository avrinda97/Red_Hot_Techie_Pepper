2008-05-11T18:31:00.000Z	Bert_2		hi, I've upgraded to 8.04 yesterday and I have a question, why does nautilus call all my partitions "Media of XXGB" thought they're mounted on specific places by me (/etc/fstab) ?
2008-05-11T18:31:00.000Z	Oli```	Bert_2	that's just the new behaviour in gnome now =(
2008-05-11T18:32:00.000Z	Bert_2	Oli```	is there a work-around, like a label or something ?
2008-05-11T18:33:00.000Z	Oli```	Bert_2	I've just put up with it - Thankfully all my volumes are different sizes but I'll have a look
2008-05-11T18:34:00.000Z	Bert_2	Oli```	I'm going to search the ubuntuforums and soem GNOME docs, perhaps I can find a way
2008-05-11T18:34:00.000Z	Oli```	Bert_2	if you do find a way, please drop me a PM =)
2008-05-11T18:36:00.000Z	Oli```	Bert_2	okay I've got something... apparently things need proper labels now - mountpoints won't do
2008-05-11T18:36:00.000Z	Oli```	Bert_2	run "sudo blkid" to see if your drives have labels, if they don't, read: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=4835670&postcount=17
2008-05-11T18:37:00.000Z	Bert_2	Oli```	okey great, thanks :D
2008-05-11T18:38:00.000Z	Oli```	Bert_2	or just go to computer:/// in nautilus, right click each volume and go to properties and rename it
2008-05-11T18:39:00.000Z	Bert_2	Oli```	that last idea is better I guess, especially for new users
2008-05-11T18:39:00.000Z	Oli```	Bert_2	*grumbles* that doesn't appear to be implemented yet though for some unknown reason
2008-05-11T18:40:00.000Z	Bert_2	Oli```	apparently: they don't have a backend or something
2008-05-11T18:40:00.000Z	Oli```	Bert_2	indeed.. I'm trying it as root
2008-05-11T18:40:00.000Z	Oli```	Bert_2	Nope.. no love there
2008-05-11T18:41:00.000Z	Bert_2	Oli```	lol, and I'm wearing a "computer+gnome=love" shirt :p
2008-05-11T18:41:00.000Z	Oli```		rofl Bert_2 - might be time to shred it
2008-05-11T18:42:00.000Z	Bert_2	Oli```	lol :p
2008-05-11T18:43:00.000Z	Oli```	Bert_2	e2label looks like it's working... I'll need to restart before I know for sure
2008-05-11T18:43:00.000Z	Bert_2	Oli```	this label command only works for ext2 and ext3 I think, cause it's not working for FAT32
2008-05-11T18:43:00.000Z	Oli```		aha
2008-05-11T18:44:00.000Z	Oli```	Bert_2	check out the FAT section of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RenameUSBDrive
