2008-08-17T04:51:00.000Z	yowshi		is there a way to get the kenrel to use a new partition setup on a disk after using fdisk on a harddrive without rebooting?
2008-08-17T04:51:00.000Z	mgolisch	yowshi	yeah
2008-08-17T04:51:00.000Z	yowshi	mgolisch	how?
2008-08-17T04:52:00.000Z	mgolisch	yowshi	hdparm -z i think
2008-08-17T04:53:00.000Z	yowshi	mgolisch	grrr says device is busy even though it isnt doing anything
2008-08-17T04:53:00.000Z	mgolisch	yowshi	no partitons on it are mounted?
2008-08-17T04:53:00.000Z	yowshi	mgolisch	nope
2008-08-17T04:54:00.000Z	mgolisch	yowshi	hm i have no idea then
2008-08-17T04:54:00.000Z	yowshi	mgolisch	heh i just double checked and there was 1 mounted partition i thought i had unmounted but hadnt
2008-08-17T04:54:00.000Z	yowshi	mgolisch	thank you very much for the help
2008-08-17T04:57:00.000Z	yowshi	mgolisch	sudo hdparm -z /dev/sdc is the full command right?
2008-08-17T04:59:00.000Z	mgolisch	yowshi	yeah
2008-08-17T04:59:00.000Z	yowshi	mgolisch	am i supposed to do anything after that?
2008-08-17T05:00:00.000Z	mgolisch	yowshi	not realy
2008-08-17T05:01:00.000Z	yowshi	mgolisch	then this is wierd. cause i repartioned a drive to turn it's 3 partitions into one big one with fdisk. then used hdparm and when i go to mount /dev/sdc1 it is showing me the old sdc1 partition
2008-08-17T05:05:00.000Z	yowshi	mgolisch	i dont nuderstand why it is still showing the old sdc1 when it should be showing the new empty partition
2008-08-17T05:06:00.000Z	mgolisch	yowshi	it might not have been able to reread the partitontable
2008-08-17T05:06:00.000Z	mgolisch	yowshi	just reboot
2008-08-17T05:07:00.000Z	yowshi	mgolisch	in the middle of some downloads important downloads and rebooting would interupt them possibly corrupt them so i dont want to reboot
2008-08-17T05:07:00.000Z	yowshi	mgolisch	if i could i would just cancel the fdisk action
2008-08-17T05:07:00.000Z	yowshi	mgolisch	and go with the current setup for now
2008-08-17T05:11:00.000Z	yowshi	mgolisch	sudo fdisk -l sees the right partition table for sdc so wy 2ouldnt it mount right
