2008-05-12T14:05:00.000Z	kPanic_		maybe a long shot: does anyone here by any change have a HP Compaq NX-series laptop with the latest ubuntu running on it?
2008-05-12T14:05:00.000Z	kPanic_		I wonder if sleep/hibernate works on the latest kernel
2008-05-12T14:05:00.000Z	perlmonkey	kPanic_	no but I have a vintage Compaq Lite (8086) running Dos 3.2
2008-05-12T14:06:00.000Z	kPanic_	perlmonkey	LOL
2008-05-12T14:06:00.000Z	kPanic_	perlmonkey	: I guess that hardware isn't really like ehmm. .. compatible?
2008-05-12T14:08:00.000Z	kPanic_	perlmonkey	I have a 2 year old NX-8220, runs Ubuntu beautifully (with AIGLX), but because of the SLAB-allocator (and ATI-prop. drivers) the sleep/hibernate doesn;t work
2008-05-12T14:09:00.000Z	perlmonkey	kPanic_	ahh, its a common prob with laptops running Linux eh, I have the same prob with my Toshiba Tecra and many other makes/models
2008-05-12T14:10:00.000Z	kPanic_	perlmonkey	ah.. ok.. it's a bigger problem, not only HP laptops.. okay..
2008-05-12T14:12:00.000Z	kPanic_	perlmonkey	whow.. that's old.. is it still working like it's supposed to?
2008-05-12T14:12:00.000Z	perlmonkey	kPanic_	my toshiba is weird.. sometimes it will sleep and resume fine, and other times it wont wake up, its like random :D
2008-05-12T14:12:00.000Z	perlmonkey	kPanic_	in the end I just disabled suspend/sleep function
2008-05-12T14:12:00.000Z	kPanic_	perlmonkey	me too, but that really sux coz it takes ages to boot :s
2008-05-12T14:13:00.000Z	kPanic_	perlmonkey	you're toshiba; does it have ATI-video>
2008-05-12T14:14:00.000Z	perlmonkey	kPanic_	has S3 SuperSavage, 16mb vdram
2008-05-12T14:14:00.000Z	perlmonkey	kPanic_	not too shabby a card, had better luck in Linux with it (and as a mythtv client) than other graphics cards in past
2008-05-12T14:15:00.000Z	kPanic_	perlmonkey	ah.ok.. that's why it prolly sometimes works; using ATI-cards suspend2ram and hibernate just never works... system locks up completely
2008-05-12T14:16:00.000Z	perlmonkey	kPanic_	are you going to stay with Compaq/HP or try something else?
2008-05-12T14:17:00.000Z	kPanic_	perlmonkey	not sure yet.. I love HP coz of their service, but they use ATI (except when you have the laptop built by specs, expensive)
2008-05-12T14:17:00.000Z	perlmonkey	kPanic_	aye, i like HP as a company too, but i dislike ATI i must say
2008-05-12T14:20:00.000Z	kPanic_	perlmonkey	that's a lot! Regular usage of high processor-usage?
2008-05-12T14:22:00.000Z	kPanic_	perlmonkey	lol.. i was just complaining in a dutch chatroom bout the high temp the processor : 85 c :s
2008-05-12T14:24:00.000Z	kPanic_	perlmonkey	: yup, but mine has to be cleaned too .. tabacco + cathear = HOT
