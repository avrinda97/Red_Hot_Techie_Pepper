2006-09-07T10:43:00.000Z	Luca_		cdbuya is it normal that iwconfig does NOT see the wireless in the environment even if wlassistant does?
2006-09-07T10:44:00.000Z	dragonriot	Luca_	I don't know about your specific WLAN card, but mine only works "halfway" even with DriverLoader.... if I do the setup manually it doesn't work at all...
2006-09-07T10:45:00.000Z	Luca_	dragonriot	wireless card functions perfectly, I have already connected more than once from Linux
2006-09-07T10:46:00.000Z	dragonriot	Luca_	just that your iwconfig doesn't see the card, even when it's connected?
2006-09-07T10:47:00.000Z	Luca_	dragonriot	uhm damn I dunno right know...I mean I am under Windows obviously so I cannot check
2006-09-07T10:47:00.000Z	dragonriot	Luca_	obviously?  heh... I switched over to Linux just to use xchat. =)
2006-09-07T10:49:00.000Z	Luca_	dragonriot	I have dual boot, but it does NOT connect from Linux, so I cannot use it right now :-P
2006-09-07T10:52:00.000Z	dragonriot	Luca_	I have a similar problem with my Wireless... It is properly configured in both Windows XP and Ubuntu, with identical WEP keys (Using WEP because I have another computer that is "B" only/WEP only) and only my Windows install will connect to the router.
2006-09-07T10:52:00.000Z	Luca_	dragonriot	EXACTLY my problem
2006-09-07T10:52:00.000Z	Luca_	dragonriot	surely I do NOT understand why
2006-09-07T10:53:00.000Z	dragonriot	Luca_	what did you use to configure the WLAN and can you activate it?
2006-09-07T10:54:00.000Z	Luca_	dragonriot	wlassistant
2006-09-07T10:54:00.000Z	Luca_	dragonriot	the wireless did functin from the first moment I installed ubuntu
2006-09-07T10:56:00.000Z	dragonriot	Luca_	so did mine, rather, it was detected and present since I put in the LiveCD, but I couldn't actually activate it until I used Driverloader instead of NDISWrapper.
2006-09-07T10:57:00.000Z	Luca_	dragonriot	no similar problem, it worked always smoothly...but in these cases
2006-09-07T11:01:00.000Z	Luca_	dragonriot	have you seen my PM?
2006-09-07T11:02:00.000Z	dragonriot	Luca_	I have not... one moment
2006-09-07T11:03:00.000Z	Luca_	dragonriot	my fault I am not a registered user
2006-09-07T11:03:00.000Z	dragonriot	Luca_	Perhaps you should register... it is Free. =)
2006-09-07T11:07:00.000Z	dragonriot	Luca_	/join #broadcom
2006-09-07T11:15:00.000Z	Luca_	dragonriot	disconnected for a moment
2006-09-07T11:15:00.000Z	dragonriot	Luca_	I saw that. =)
