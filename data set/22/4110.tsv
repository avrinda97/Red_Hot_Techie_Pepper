2008-04-13T07:47:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		what's the link to search repos online?
2008-04-13T07:47:00.000Z	Flannel	kindofabuzz	packages.ubuntu.com
2008-04-13T07:51:00.000Z	Flannel	kindofabuzz	Or just wait a few weeks for Hardy to come out
2008-05-10T12:49:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Flannel	probably a distro full of games
2008-07-26T04:15:00.000Z	Flannel	kindofabuzz	erm... I think that's offtopic.
2008-07-26T15:57:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Flannel	he can't just upgrade to 8.04
2008-07-26T15:57:00.000Z	Flannel	kindofabuzz	You're right.  Who said otherwise?
2008-07-26T15:59:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Flannel	you, you said to just upgrade
2008-07-26T15:59:00.000Z	Flannel	kindofabuzz	Where did I do that?
2008-07-26T15:59:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Flannel	[05:57:13] <Flannel> ogge: No need to remove, just install the next one overtop.  8.04 will work, yeah.  You'll want the alternate CD if you're going to use fluxbox.
2008-07-26T16:00:00.000Z	Flannel	kindofabuzz	installing overtop is not upgrading.
2008-07-26T16:00:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Flannel	my bad, misunderstood ya
2008-07-26T16:00:00.000Z	Flannel	kindofabuzz	no worries
2008-08-02T16:19:00.000Z	Flannel	kindofabuzz	you can technically apt-get from the desktop CD, it just only has a handful of packages
2008-08-02T16:19:00.000Z	Flannel	kindofabuzz	the desktop CD is an image (the live image) which gets copied to your harddrive.  The alternate CD actually contains packages.
2008-08-02T16:19:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Flannel	k
2008-08-02T16:20:00.000Z	Flannel	kindofabuzz	Live is an image.
2008-08-02T16:20:00.000Z	Flannel	kindofabuzz	And there are a few packages (not included in the image) that people may need to connect to the internet, etc (build-essential as an example)
2008-08-02T16:26:00.000Z	Flannel	kindofabuzz	debian provides their entire repos on CDs
2008-08-02T16:26:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Flannel	yeah all 13 cd's
2009-08-02T12:16:00.000Z	Flannel	kindofabuzz	blognewb_: you generally don't want to assume yes to things like that.  Since often the questions will be unexpected/dangerous/etc
2009-12-12T12:18:00.000Z	Flannel	kindofabuzz	Just installing the right package(s) is fine.  You'll also want to move from -server to -generic probably
