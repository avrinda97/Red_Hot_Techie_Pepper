2009-10-04T11:39:00.000Z	Ipsilon		my machine is fine
2009-10-04T11:40:00.000Z	Ipsilon		q6600, 8800gt, 4gb ram, 7200rpm harddrive
2009-10-04T11:40:00.000Z	Ipsilon		vmware?
2009-10-04T11:41:00.000Z	Ipsilon		so should I go for wubi?
2009-10-04T11:42:00.000Z	Ipsilon		4gb
2009-10-04T11:43:00.000Z	Ipsilon		does installation size mean the size it will have to install other stuff into it?
2009-10-04T11:45:00.000Z	Ipsilon		In the installer it says "installation size".. and you can choose from a couple gb to a lot more.. I don't unserstand what the difference between 3gb and 17gb would be
2009-10-04T11:46:00.000Z	Ipsilon		that's what i thought
2009-10-04T11:46:00.000Z	Ipsilon		thnx
2009-10-04T11:46:00.000Z	Ipsilon		well 50 min to finish :/ so I guess it's waiting time :P
2009-10-04T11:47:00.000Z	avishek	Ipsilon	enjoy yourself!
2009-10-04T11:31:00.000Z	avishek	Ipsilon	I agree, Linux can be difficult for new users, but even non-programmers find it useful
2009-10-04T11:32:00.000Z	avishek	Ipsilon	At office, I'm the only programmer, but everyone else who uses Ubuntu loves it
2009-10-04T11:33:00.000Z	avishek	Ipsilon	keep the dual boot. most machines at my workplace have only about 30GB harddisk space. I've made a small Windows partition (5GB) and the rest for Ubuntu
2009-10-04T11:36:00.000Z	avishek	Ipsilon	yes it does. A Live Demo works very well if you have at least 512 MB RAM.
2009-10-04T11:38:00.000Z	avishek	Ipsilon	take mgmuscari's advice
2009-10-04T11:38:00.000Z	avishek	Ipsilon	but I would say try out a Wubi install - install Ubuntu into Windows just like any application. what do you think mgmuscari?
2009-10-04T11:41:00.000Z	avishek	Ipsilon	a Live Session looks very plain and dull, so don't get the incorrect impression.
2009-10-04T11:42:00.000Z	avishek	Ipsilon	yes, I think so
2009-10-04T11:42:00.000Z	avishek	Ipsilon	it'll run slightly slower, but not noticeably so if you have about 512 MB RAM
2009-10-04T11:46:00.000Z	avishek	Ipsilon	it refers to the amount of hard size that will be allocated for Ubuntu
2009-10-04T11:47:00.000Z	avishek	Ipsilon	welcome
