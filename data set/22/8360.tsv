2006-03-12T17:32:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	man chmod
2006-03-12T17:37:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	you read the man page  but still don't see how to use it ?      ok.    sudo chmod 644 <file>    if it's data   or    chmod 755 <file>   if it's (supposed to be) executable
2006-03-12T17:38:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	also note that directories need to be executable.
2006-03-12T17:44:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	i know nothing of "data manager"   what are you trying to do ?    and the permissions being p*  means pipe.   do an ls -l <file>  and show me the output
2006-03-12T17:51:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	i'm not sure what has happened there.  but it looks to me like your emule is trying to pipe data to/from /usr/local/bin  to/from /usr/local/bin    i.e.  mobius loop.     ;S
2006-03-12T17:53:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	i don't really know i've never messed an inode up like that before....
2006-03-12T17:54:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	try    sudo ls /usr/local/bin/
2006-03-12T17:55:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	  sudo killall emule
2006-03-12T17:58:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	use top or "ps ax "   to search for emule  make sure it's not running.
2006-03-12T17:59:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	any idea what all you are going to loose if you have to rm that dir ?      emule for one thing.    were there other files in there ?
2006-03-12T06:02:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	well you should be able to    ' sudo rm -i /usr/local/bin '    root can delete it .
2006-03-12T06:03:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	   ' sudo rm -Ri /usr/local/bin '
2006-03-12T06:06:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	was it a pointy clicky drag and drop thing ?
2006-03-12T06:08:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	reinstall it as before.  but rather than drag and drop  right click and creat a launcher
2006-03-12T06:10:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	^
2006-03-12T06:11:00.000Z	intelikey	Ekumba	any time.
