2010-11-15T12:49:00.000Z	TwoD	bullgard4	the icons list?
2010-11-15T12:50:00.000Z	bullgard4	TwoD	yes.
2010-11-15T12:51:00.000Z	TwoD	bullgard4	it allows you to add one or more tags/icons to a file. As simple as that. =)
2010-11-15T12:51:00.000Z	TwoD	bullgard4	I believe you can add your own icons too, though I don't remember the details.
2010-11-15T12:51:00.000Z	TwoD	bullgard4	check a few and see what happens.
2010-11-15T12:54:00.000Z	bullgard4	TwoD	You did not answer my question I asked: Who has made this list? I did not make it. And I cannot see any relation to the file whose name I highlighted.
2010-11-15T12:59:00.000Z	TwoD	bullgard4	I don't know who made it, but it's the same for all files.
2010-11-15T13:00:00.000Z	TwoD	bullgard4	It's just a default set, thought that was pretty obvious since you didn't make it. ;)
2010-11-15T13:04:00.000Z	bullgard4	TwoD	I can't help but thinking that you are a frolic man. --  Yes, it is the same for all files. And the contents has nothing to do with the contents of the currently highlighted file. Even your "default set" stems somewhere.
2010-11-15T13:16:00.000Z	TwoD	bullgard4	Frolic man? Nobody's ever called me that before. I'm not a native English speaker so I'm not sure what it means either hehe
2010-11-15T13:17:00.000Z	TwoD	bullgard4	Why does it matter who put the icons there?
2010-11-15T13:21:00.000Z	bullgard4	TwoD	'~dict frolic; From WordNet (r) 3.0 (2006) [wn]:   frolic:   v 1: play boisterously; "The children frolicked in the garden"; "the gamboling lambs in the meadows"; "The toddlers romped in the playroom" [syn: {frolic}, {lark}, {rollick}, {skylark}, {disport}, {sport}, {cavort}, {gambol}, {frisk}, {romp}, {run around}, {lark about}]".  --  It matters because I am not sure what will happen...
2010-11-15T13:24:00.000Z	TwoD	bullgard4	Well, I suppose the files having any of the tags being deleted will no longer have those tags, or at least not the icon associated with it. Why not assign a tag to a file, move/delete the icon and see what happens?
2010-11-15T13:29:00.000Z	bullgard4	TwoD	Trial and error is a very inefficient method in mastering Linux usage. I am testing and testing again Linux features for more than 3 years now and still have not gained a comprehensive command of Linux. --  Have you ever heard that a deductive procedure in natural science is much more efficient?
2010-11-15T13:32:00.000Z	TwoD	bullgard4	Of course, but to find out what happens in this case, one only needs to try once, which is probably going to take a lot less time than finding the documentation detailing it. ;)
2010-11-15T13:33:00.000Z	bullgard4	TwoD	Thank you for commenting.
2010-11-15T13:34:00.000Z	TwoD	bullgard4	You're welcome. Wish I could say what actually happens for sure, but I've never needed to remove any of them. If you do find out while I'm here, mind telling?
2010-11-15T13:36:00.000Z	bullgard4	TwoD	I will do. But I am afraid I will not succeed today.
2010-11-15T13:48:00.000Z	TwoD	bullgard4	Removing the standard emblems might not be so easy. Adding/removing custom ones is easily done via Nautilu's Edit menu though. http://ubuntu-ky.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=81767
2010-11-15T13:51:00.000Z	bullgard4	TwoD	Your article is of 2007. What I am interested in is of Maverick and has appeared much later than 2007 in Nautilus.
2010-11-15T13:55:00.000Z	TwoD	bullgard4	I don't know how long they've been there, but it's a long time... The text is still valid though, standard emblems can't be removed easily because things depend on them being there.
