2007-06-16T08:08:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		that isnt going to work vertigo
2007-06-16T08:08:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		he needs to do a "echo $PATH"
2007-06-16T08:08:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		cause export has all kindsa crap in it.
2007-06-16T08:09:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		vertigo, thats fine... but ...
2007-06-16T08:09:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		echo 'EXPORT $PATH' >> ~/.bashrc isnt going to do it.
2007-06-16T08:09:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		i dont believ3.
2007-06-16T08:09:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		oops, i didnt even mean to be ub3r.
2007-06-16T08:09:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		lol!!!
2007-06-16T08:09:00.000Z	veritgo	r00tintheb0x	after the whole path thing it should
2007-06-16T08:10:00.000Z	veritgo	r00tintheb0x	other than the export being upper case, why?
2007-06-16T08:10:00.000Z	veritgo	r00tintheb0x	after you've already defined PATH in the previous line
2007-06-16T08:11:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	veritgo	there's no "PATH=" when you echo
2007-06-16T08:11:00.000Z	veritgo	r00tintheb0x	that should be enough for your shell
2007-06-16T08:11:00.000Z	veritgo	r00tintheb0x	which is why i said to do it AFTER defining path.
2007-06-16T08:11:00.000Z	veritgo	r00tintheb0x	the export should not be necessary for just your shell, but if your launching other apps, i think it will be needed
2007-06-16T08:12:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	veritgo	is the path statement in .bashrc or .bash_profile
2007-06-16T08:15:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	veritgo	is your path statement in your /etc/profile?
2007-06-16T08:16:00.000Z	veritgo	r00tintheb0x	no
2007-06-16T08:16:00.000Z	veritgo	r00tintheb0x	theres a rather complete definition in /etc/environment
2007-06-16T08:17:00.000Z	veritgo	r00tintheb0x	not sure if that gets parsed by anything though, or even what it is
