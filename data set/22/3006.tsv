2009-01-05T10:21:00.000Z	tbonechic		I have a question: I have mplayer and I run it through x11, but it never plays properly. :( any suggestions?
2009-01-05T10:21:00.000Z	tbonechic		cryptnix: I have intrepid running on a latidude D630.  will that do?
2009-01-05T10:22:00.000Z	cyorxamp	tbonechic	if your talking to me, then does that use GM965 / X3100 intel graphics?#
2009-01-05T10:23:00.000Z	tbonechic	cyorxamp	no. leme chek
2009-01-05T10:24:00.000Z	tbonechic	cyorxamp	it's a GM965/GL960 intel graphics card.
2009-01-05T10:25:00.000Z	cyorxamp	tbonechic	thats the one :D
2009-01-05T10:25:00.000Z	cyorxamp	tbonechic	the same 8.04 that came with it?
2009-01-05T10:26:00.000Z	tbonechic	cyorxamp	no, I installed it via LiveCD and upgraded to Intrepid
2009-01-05T10:27:00.000Z	cyorxamp	tbonechic	might be worth a look anyway, just wondered if I could looksie at your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
2009-01-05T10:27:00.000Z	cyorxamp	tbonechic	pop it in a nopate
2009-01-05T10:27:00.000Z	tbonechic	cyorxamp	...?
2009-01-05T10:28:00.000Z	cyorxamp	tbonechic	http://paste.ubuntu.com
2009-01-05T10:33:00.000Z	tbonechic	cyorxamp	and it's sent ^_^
2009-01-05T10:35:00.000Z	cyorxamp	tbonechic	thats your -complete- xorg.conf? it's missing loads
2009-01-05T10:36:00.000Z	tbonechic	cyorxamp	... that what I got. I'll check again
2009-01-05T10:37:00.000Z	cyorxamp	tbonechic	no it has all the right sections, just bugger all in each of them
2009-01-05T10:41:00.000Z	tbonechic	cyorxamp	bugger?
2009-01-05T10:41:00.000Z	cyorxamp	tbonechic	it's british slang :D
2009-01-05T10:41:00.000Z	tbonechic	cyorxamp	lol
2009-01-05T10:41:00.000Z	cyorxamp	tbonechic	"bugger all" = "nothing at all"
2009-01-05T10:48:00.000Z	tbonechic	cyorxamp	I think the reason I don't have anything is because xserver-conf isn't installed--which may solve my other problem...
