2007-06-02T13:48:00.000Z	Aerotwelve1		Can anyone here help me with installing these drivers? http://ipw3945.sourceforge.net/ Will running the makefile set it up for me, or will I need to use ndiswrapper?
2007-06-02T13:48:00.000Z	Aerotwelve1		They're native linux drivers, fyi.
2007-06-02T13:49:00.000Z	eudoxos_	Aerotwelve1	ipw 1395 drivers are native for linux, it has nothing to do wth ndiswrapper.
2007-06-02T13:49:00.000Z	eudoxos_	Aerotwelve1	 They are also included in default kernel builds for feisty and if you isntall restricted-modules package, you will get the firmware IIRC also, so everything should work out-of-box.
2007-06-02T13:50:00.000Z	Aerotwelve1	eudoxos_	How can I install that? My wireless card isn't working out of the box, I'm on a wired connection at the moment. Thanks for your help.
2007-06-02T13:54:00.000Z	Aerotwelve1	eudoxos_	Would this command download the drivers?  sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-2.6.20-15-generic
2007-06-02T13:55:00.000Z	eudoxos_	Aerotwelve1	I just looked at the driver is in feisty's kernel (2.6.20-15-generic). The modules is called ipw3945.ko. Try running "lspci  grep Intel" and "dmesg  |grep 3945", that should tell you something
2007-06-02T13:57:00.000Z	Aerotwelve1	eudoxos_	Hmm, those didn't seem to do much. Typing in the lspci brings up the standard syntax  helper screen, and the dmesg |grep command just yielded a blank screen. Any thoughts?
2007-06-02T13:58:00.000Z	eudoxos_	Aerotwelve1	 just type "lspci", it should list your PCI devices...?
2007-06-02T13:58:00.000Z	Aerotwelve1	eudoxos_	Yep, that works. Do you want the output?
2007-06-02T13:59:00.000Z	eudoxos_	Aerotwelve1	 look at the line that has Intel something, that's the one we need.
2007-06-02T13:59:00.000Z	Aerotwelve1		!pastebin
2007-06-02T14:00:00.000Z	eudoxos_	Aerotwelve1	 paste it somewhere.
2007-06-02T14:00:00.000Z	Aerotwelve1	eudoxos_	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/23780/ Thats my lspci output, it has alot of lines with Intel in it.
2007-06-02T14:02:00.000Z	eudoxos_	Aerotwelve1	 there is no ipw3945 device listed, the rest of Intel is chipset. I bet the wireless device is the last one.
2007-06-02T14:03:00.000Z	eudoxos_	Aerotwelve1	that device is not supported, hence you will need to do that nediswrapper hell.
2007-06-02T14:03:00.000Z	Aerotwelve1	eudoxos_	The broadcom device? Hmm, it says thats what this laptop ships with...
2007-06-02T14:04:00.000Z	eudoxos_	Aerotwelve1	it works well for some people though; search the web, there is plenty of ndsiwrapper and feisty howtos I bet.
2007-06-02T14:05:00.000Z	eudoxos_	Aerotwelve1	they perhaps gave you different model or cheated you. But the device isn't there (almost) for sure.
2007-06-02T14:06:00.000Z	Aerotwelve1	eudoxos_	Hmm, it's a Dell laptop. Anyway, is there any way I can find out the specific model of the card?
2007-06-02T14:09:00.000Z	eudoxos_	Aerotwelve1	do lspci -n and look up the corresponding numbers like 12cd:de44 on the internet.
2007-06-02T14:11:00.000Z	eudoxos_	Aerotwelve1	googling for broadcom 4328 (the number given by lspci) gives many results also.
