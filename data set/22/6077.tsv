2007-06-09T16:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	i don't think so... why would you want it?
2007-06-09T16:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	i think the best linux av, is ClamAV
2007-06-09T16:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	what did you search for in synaptic?.. bluez-gnome is there.
2007-06-09T16:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	do a search just for bluez
2007-06-09T16:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	its best to be brief, rather than specific in your searches when searching synaptic, just the first basic word will usually find it.
2007-06-09T05:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	wait a sec, you don't have a third party software tab?
2007-06-09T05:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	did you search synaptic?
2007-06-09T05:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	that doesn't make any sense, did you search for it in synaptic?
2007-06-09T05:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	i'm thinking.
2007-06-09T05:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	open synaptic, settings menu, then Repositories, then click on the THird Party Software tab.. what boxes are checked there?
2007-06-09T05:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	 hm, ok what is checked on the first tab
2007-06-09T05:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	well, that doesn't make any sense
2007-06-09T05:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	did you get lost?
2007-06-10T07:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	anyone with common sense has it...lol
2007-06-10T07:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	first, upgrade to feisty
2007-06-10T07:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	oh thats right, the laptop
2007-06-10T07:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	well how do you know it has Feisty on the new laptop?\
2007-06-10T07:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	didn't you order a new laptop or something, maybe i'm confusing you with someone else.
2007-06-10T07:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	how do you kno w it didn't install?
2007-06-10T07:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	luke__	you can get Limewire from LImewire.com
