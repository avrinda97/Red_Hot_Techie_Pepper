2006-05-25T13:22:00.000Z	dmbt		what are you trying to install acke ?
2006-05-25T13:24:00.000Z	dmbt		what does it say?
2006-05-25T13:24:00.000Z	dmbt		then
2006-05-25T13:24:00.000Z	dmbt		or your going to have problems in the long run
2006-05-25T13:25:00.000Z	dmbt		and goto  edit => fix broken packages
2006-05-25T13:25:00.000Z	dmbt		compiling is kind of hardcore
2006-05-25T13:25:00.000Z	dmbt		its always easier to avoid compiling if you don't have to for most things
2006-05-25T13:26:00.000Z	dmbt		well, you just have to wait a little bit then :)
2006-05-25T13:28:00.000Z	dmbt		and ill tell you how to fix it
2006-05-25T13:29:00.000Z	dmbt		not a 286
2006-05-25T13:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dmbt	afaik it will run on 286 just very badly
2006-05-25T13:30:00.000Z	dmbt	gnomefreak	i don't think so
2006-05-25T13:30:00.000Z	dmbt	gnomefreak	kernel is built for a 386
2006-05-25T13:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dmbt	cant really go by that
2006-05-25T13:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dmbt	if you went by that than they would have kernels for 1.6 gig
2006-05-25T13:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dmbt	ubuntu may need it but than again server install should run on a 286 (i said should) i dont use anything that slow
2006-05-25T13:33:00.000Z	dmbt	gnomefreak	i'm talking about booting the kernel
2006-05-25T13:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dmbt	are you in offtopic?
2006-05-25T13:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dmbt	someone ran ubuntu on a 233
2006-05-25T13:34:00.000Z	dmbt	gnomefreak	are you talking about proc speed, or proc architecture?
2006-05-25T13:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dmbt	speed
2006-06-01T05:45:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dmbt	yes
