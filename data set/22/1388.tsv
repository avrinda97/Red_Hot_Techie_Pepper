2010-05-30T18:18:00.000Z	Guest20334	jrib	i would have done that if I could
2010-05-30T18:19:00.000Z	jrib	Guest20334	why can't you?
2010-05-30T18:19:00.000Z	Guest20334	jrib	i am stuck in a desktop environment that doesn't work
2010-05-30T18:19:00.000Z	jrib	Guest20334	what desktop environment?
2010-05-30T18:19:00.000Z	Guest20334	jrib	KDE
2010-05-30T18:19:00.000Z	Guest20334	jrib	i want to exit out but there is no option
2010-05-30T18:19:00.000Z	jrib	Guest20334	try #kubuntu
2010-05-30T18:19:00.000Z	Guest20334	jrib	tell me the command to get out
2010-05-30T18:20:00.000Z	jrib	Guest20334	I don't know it for kde
2010-05-30T18:20:00.000Z	Guest20334	jrib	me neither that is why someone must help!!
2010-05-30T18:20:00.000Z	jrib	Guest20334	you could just ctrl-alt-f1 and kill your user, but #kubuntu may know a more elegant way
2010-05-30T18:20:00.000Z	Guest20334	jrib	what is the command for killing the user?
2010-05-30T18:21:00.000Z	jrib	Guest20334	you may use some incantation of pkill for example
2010-05-30T18:22:00.000Z	Guest20334	jrib	tell me the command!!
2010-05-30T18:22:00.000Z	Guest20334	jrib	??
2010-05-30T18:25:00.000Z	jrib	Guest20334	I suggested you try #kubuntu, did they know a better way?
2010-05-30T18:26:00.000Z	Guest20334	jrib	ok how about this tell me the command to restart the damn system
2010-05-30T18:26:00.000Z	Guest20334	jrib	nevermind
2010-05-30T18:28:00.000Z	jrib	Guest20334	if you have a shell, then your best bet is to find the equivalent of gnome-session-save on kde (ask #kubuntu), if you just want to reboot « sudo reboot ».  If both of those fail, what itheos said
