2006-10-13T07:53:00.000Z	chuckyp	kyle__	are you able to get to a console and know how to use it?
2006-10-13T07:53:00.000Z	kyle__	chuckyp	yea
2006-10-13T07:55:00.000Z	chuckyp	kyle__	ahh never mind I found the page  there are two options you have using the gui or using apt-get via console check it out.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DapperUpgrades
2006-10-13T07:56:00.000Z	kyle__	chuckyp	i'd check it out, but i can't open firefox
2006-10-13T07:56:00.000Z	chuckyp	kyle__	durr my bad
2006-10-13T07:56:00.000Z	chuckyp	kyle__	lol
2006-10-13T07:56:00.000Z	chuckyp	kyle__	first you should back up any data that you really need on your system.
2006-10-13T07:57:00.000Z	chuckyp	kyle__	is your system up to date currently?
2006-10-13T07:58:00.000Z	kyle__	chuckyp	no i just checked System>Administration>Update Manager and it had a bunch of files like 205 mb worth
2006-10-13T07:58:00.000Z	chuckyp	kyle__	well I would apply those updates prior to doing a dist-upgrade just to be safe.
2006-10-13T07:58:00.000Z	chuckyp	kyle__	after you apply those you want to just click on "check" in the update manager it should show you that dapper is availible.
2006-10-13T07:59:00.000Z	chuckyp	kyle__	and offer you to upgrade
2006-10-13T07:59:00.000Z	kyle__	chuckyp	i wont have to manually edit sources.list or ...
2006-10-13T07:59:00.000Z	chuckyp	kyle__	not if the update manger is working properly it should prompt you about the new version of dapper.
2006-10-13T08:00:00.000Z	kyle__		alright i'll see where it takes me then, thx
2006-10-13T08:00:00.000Z	chuckyp	kyle__	if you need to launch the update manager for whatever reason you could open a terminal or alt+f2 to bring up a run command then type gksudo update-manager
