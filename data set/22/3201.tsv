2008-12-03T01:19:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	still there?
2008-12-03T01:22:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	could you describe the hardware you're trying to network using?
2008-12-03T01:24:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	that's the frequency and protocol.  Does it have a model number?
2008-12-03T01:26:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	OK, lemme take a look at the manual.
2008-12-03T01:26:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	the manual is on the web. :)
2008-12-03T01:28:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	that router doesn't seem to have USB connectivity.  It's ethernet.  Are you sure that's what you have?
2008-12-03T01:29:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	Oh... so how are you connecting to the internet right now?  Cable modem?  DSL modem?  Telephone line?
2008-12-03T01:30:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	that is, what brand and model of USB modem are you using?
2008-12-03T01:34:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	Um.... that doesn't make sense.
2008-12-03T01:35:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	the modem should connect only telephone line and USB and power.  It should not connect to the router.
2008-12-03T01:36:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	you know the difference between telephone line and ethernet line, right?  Telephone line is four pins, ethernet is eight (well, not pins.  Little sliders.  The plug looks very similar between the two, but phone is narrower and ethernet is wider.)
2008-12-03T01:41:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	please check what connectors you have going where.  Let's start at the wall.  Is it 8-connector (RJ45, like Ethernet) or 4-connector (RJ11, like telephone_)?
2008-12-03T01:43:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	Oh, you're not on ubuntu now?  Sorry.
2008-12-03T01:44:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	OK.  Let's trace wires.... is the wire _from the wall_ 8-pin (RJ45 ethernet) or 4-pin (RJ11 POTS)
2008-12-03T01:46:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	OK... is it round?  Like cable-TV cable?
2008-12-03T01:46:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	and the connector on the end screws onto the back of the modem?
2008-12-03T01:47:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	OK, you have a cable broadband then.
2008-12-03T01:48:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	OK... now look at the jacks on the D-link.  What are the 8-pin jacks labeled?
2008-12-03T01:49:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	not the lights.  the places where you can plug cables in.
2008-12-03T01:51:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	do you know what I mean by a "jack"?  It's where you plug cables in.
2008-12-03T01:52:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	now please just tell me what each of the jacks are labeled.  (some Dlink jacks have built-in LEDs but that isn't important.  What's important is the labels on the jacks)
2008-12-03T02:00:00.000Z	Zzeiss	le1	gotta boogie.  Bad news phone call.
