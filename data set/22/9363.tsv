2004-11-28T08:15:00.000Z	GotD0t		ok... i hate to ask again, but does anybody know how to set the default sound device? because all my sounds go to a device that doesnt have speakers hooked up
2004-11-28T08:16:00.000Z	GotD0t		does anybody even get my messages?\
2004-11-28T08:17:00.000Z	GotD0t		then a little acknowledgement of my existence would be kind
2004-11-28T08:17:00.000Z	farruinn	GotD0t	the best advice I have is to read the alsa doc
2004-12-23T10:27:00.000Z	farruinn	GotD0t	second machine I believe
2004-12-23T13:48:00.000Z	GotD0t	farruinn	what would be more useful would be an autonomous bot
2004-12-23T13:48:00.000Z	farruinn	GotD0t	autonomous?
2004-12-23T13:49:00.000Z	GotD0t	farruinn	like pick up on questions and answer them, instead of you telling it something
2004-12-23T13:50:00.000Z	farruinn	GotD0t	ok, that's what I thought you meant.  It's supposed to do that, but I haven't found it to yet
2004-12-23T13:50:00.000Z	GotD0t	farruinn	hmm
2004-12-23T15:00:00.000Z	GotD0t	farruinn	it should be able to self recognize
2004-12-23T15:14:00.000Z	farruinn	GotD0t	I tried
2004-12-24T10:43:00.000Z	farruinn	GotD0t	you should /msg him to keep the noise down in here
2004-12-24T10:47:00.000Z	GotD0t	farruinn	you're right, his db is borked
2004-12-24T10:49:00.000Z	GotD0t	farruinn	well it doesnt work as of know, therefore db = borked
2004-12-24T11:51:00.000Z	GotD0t	farruinn	his db is gone...
2004-12-24T11:52:00.000Z	GotD0t	farruinn	true...
2004-12-24T11:52:00.000Z	GotD0t	farruinn	there was restricted formats
2004-12-25T07:19:00.000Z	farruinn	GotD0t	I don't think that's what he want's in this case
2004-12-25T07:19:00.000Z	GotD0t	farruinn	?
2004-12-25T07:19:00.000Z	GotD0t	farruinn	what would that do
2004-12-26T10:56:00.000Z	GotD0t	farruinn	no prob
