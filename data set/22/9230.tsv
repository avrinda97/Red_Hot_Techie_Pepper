2005-01-27T14:06:00.000Z	randabis		check your volume?
2005-01-27T14:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	randabis	heh, done :)
2005-01-27T14:08:00.000Z	randabis	eyequeue	has you checked which device the mixer is using?
2005-01-27T14:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	randabis	i'm no sound guy, i don't really know what a mixer is
2005-01-27T14:08:00.000Z	randabis	eyequeue	in the volume control thingy
2005-02-12T08:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	randabis	 greater control :)
2005-02-12T08:48:00.000Z	randabis	eyequeue	fair enough :)
2005-02-25T10:34:00.000Z	eyequeue	randabis	 reminds me of "reflections on trusting trust" or whatever it's called
2005-02-25T12:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	randabis	 membreya: www.jankratochvil.net/project/captive/
2005-02-26T10:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	randabis	 ditto
2005-02-26T10:41:00.000Z	eyequeue	randabis	 i want at least one "pretty" set to pull out in front of others, not an obviously self-burned set
2005-02-26T11:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	randabis	 adjustable yes, and it's timestamp_timeout in sudoers(5) rather than passwd_timeout, which means something else, beware, heh
2005-02-26T12:15:00.000Z	eyequeue	randabis	 i'm not normally into eyecandy, but that sounds rather impressive
2005-02-26T12:15:00.000Z	randabis	eyequeue	yeah it's a nice feature
2005-02-26T12:16:00.000Z	eyequeue	randabis	 i also think it may be a nice "selling" point for those considering ubuntu
2005-02-26T12:17:00.000Z	randabis	eyequeue	yes, that's one of the reasons it is being implemented
2005-02-26T12:17:00.000Z	eyequeue	randabis	 it would need to be put on the livecd too of course
2005-02-26T12:17:00.000Z	randabis	eyequeue	it already is on the livecd iirc
2005-02-26T13:18:00.000Z	randabis	eyequeue	you completely typed that incorrectly
2005-02-26T13:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	randabis	 it was a paste, heh
2005-04-08T06:55:00.000Z	eyequeue	randabis	 yeah, i was trying to start with fake package, move to pseudo, adn then to meta, not wanting to confuse
2005-04-08T06:55:00.000Z	randabis	eyequeue	:)
