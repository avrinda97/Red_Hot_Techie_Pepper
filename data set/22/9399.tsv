2005-02-04T08:46:00.000Z	DAC1138		all, my research links, my software links, driver links, its a blog basically
2005-02-04T08:47:00.000Z	DAC1138		i would try FreeBSD< but form my experience with BSD users, their' @$$ holes (sorry for the lingo)
2005-02-04T08:48:00.000Z	DAC1138		laptops dont have PCI, do they?
2005-02-04T08:49:00.000Z	DAC1138		PCI are those big cards for pcs
2005-02-04T08:51:00.000Z	DAC1138		X.org doesnt work either, its been suggested.
2005-02-04T08:51:00.000Z	DAC1138		crashmeister on that forum had the same hardware too, his worked fine....its a gateway bios bug
2005-02-04T08:52:00.000Z	daniels	DAC1138	when did you try X.Org?
2005-02-04T08:52:00.000Z	daniels	DAC1138	the packages that have been on the Hoary live CDs for the last couple of days might be a lot more useful in terms of support
2005-02-04T08:53:00.000Z	daniels	DAC1138	i strongly suggest you try the hoary live cd, which should have these sorts of problems fixed in the last couple of days
2005-02-04T08:53:00.000Z	daniels	DAC1138	(our X.org packages are a lot more up to date than Knoppix)
2005-02-04T08:58:00.000Z	daniels	DAC1138	i think it's definitely worth a shot -- I've taken some much improved i8xx support from CVS in the last couple of days that should fix these sorts of problems
2005-02-04T09:00:00.000Z	daniels	DAC1138	yep, but you can try the Hoary live CD now if you like
2005-02-22T06:38:00.000Z	daniels	DAC1138	language
2005-07-26T09:04:00.000Z	DAC1138	daniels	just curious, why is cedega (software) off topic, but gentoo (a completely separate distro) isnt?
2005-07-26T09:04:00.000Z	daniels	DAC1138	off-topic things are fine, as long as they don't spawn huge discussions that fill up two screens or more
2005-07-26T09:04:00.000Z	daniels	DAC1138	i.e., in passing
2005-07-26T09:05:00.000Z	DAC1138	daniels	ah, i see the difference now
2005-07-26T09:05:00.000Z	daniels	DAC1138	(if there was a Gentoo discussion, I missed it while I was getting lunch)
2005-07-26T09:05:00.000Z	DAC1138	daniels	i thought this was just some nazi regime, lol. i see the point though
