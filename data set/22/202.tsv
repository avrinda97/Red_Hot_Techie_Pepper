2012-03-30T11:23:00.000Z	Tradie		hello, is anyone online
2012-03-30T11:24:00.000Z	Tradie		i need some help with the ubuntu installation. there is something going on and its confusing me heaps
2012-03-30T11:25:00.000Z	Tradie		well, i try to boot into the ubuntu entry on the boot menu, to finalise the install and it says it cannot find the installation.iso
2012-03-30T11:25:00.000Z	Tradie		but the file is there
2012-03-30T11:25:00.000Z	Tradie		ive had ubuntu running on this pc just fine before
2012-03-30T11:27:00.000Z	Tradie		well im guessing it is grub, but i installed with wubi, so its probably the crap windows one. i have had windows 8 dev build and server 2008 r2 installed mon it aswel, but i reformated before trying to install ubuntu
2012-03-30T11:28:00.000Z	Tradie		yes
2012-03-30T11:29:00.000Z	Tradie		yes
2012-03-30T11:29:00.000Z	Tradie		its just the ubuntu installation thats having trouble
2012-03-30T11:30:00.000Z	monday	Tradie	what version are you installing?
2012-03-30T11:31:00.000Z	monday	Tradie	I bet this is related to in not using something like /dev/sdb or /dev/dvd something like that.
2012-03-30T11:31:00.000Z	monday	Tradie	are you having an issue trying to boot into ubuntu or just during the install?
2012-03-30T11:32:00.000Z	monday	Tradie	mount it then.
2012-03-30T11:34:00.000Z	monday	Tradie	I've never installed within windows. I always install booting to the disc/usb drive, ..etc
2012-03-30T11:37:00.000Z	monday	Tradie	this sounds like the disc wasn't created correctly.
2012-03-30T11:37:00.000Z	monday	Tradie	can you create a new one?
2012-03-30T11:38:00.000Z	monday	Tradie	if the disc has no issue no matter what you should be able to boot using the disc. Your drive could be having an issue preventing that. In that case create a bootable USB disc with ubuntu on it.
2012-03-30T11:39:00.000Z	monday	Tradie	the difficult part of that is using windows to do it and usb boot disc creators sometimes suck outside of linux.
2012-03-30T11:40:00.000Z	monday	Tradie	the only time I've seen that issue is a screwy install script with debain systems. usually I'm able to mount it and continue but debain tells you where the issue is a bit better than ubuntu.
2012-03-30T11:41:00.000Z	monday	Tradie	after the installs on my debian systems they rarely ever have issues.
2012-03-30T11:43:00.000Z	Tradie	monday	ill be back after i try and reinstall things and move this about a bit. thanks for the advice
2012-03-30T11:44:00.000Z	monday	Tradie	I hope it helps.
