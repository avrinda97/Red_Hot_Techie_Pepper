2010-08-27T04:47:00.000Z	Cass	rww	any ideas ?
2010-08-27T04:47:00.000Z	rww	Cass	The various errors in that pastebin are generally caused by your internet connection not being reliable.
2010-08-27T04:47:00.000Z	Cass	rww	my internet connection is fine
2010-08-27T04:47:00.000Z	Cass	rww	i can d/l other stuff no probs
2010-08-27T04:48:00.000Z	rww	Cass	that's not what lines 5, 9, 17, 89, 91, 95, and 97 of the pastebin imply :\
2010-08-27T04:48:00.000Z	Cass	rww	ok .. how to prove it ?
2010-08-27T04:49:00.000Z	rww	Cass	I'd probably do it by downloading a large file that has a known md5sum and then checksumming it.

2010-08-27T04:50:00.000Z	Cass	rww	i could go on all night with that .. a 2k packet ping .. completly stable
2010-08-27T04:50:00.000Z	rww	Cass	ping has nothing to do with download corruptions
2010-08-27T04:51:00.000Z	Cass	rww	no but it proves i can xfer larger packets than mu mtu is set at
