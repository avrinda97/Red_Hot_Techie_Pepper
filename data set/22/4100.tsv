2008-03-18T20:26:00.000Z	Breth		Checking it now
2008-03-18T20:26:00.000Z	Breth		thanks
2008-03-18T20:27:00.000Z	Breth		The hardware is very very very old
2008-03-18T20:27:00.000Z	Breth		Haven't used it in years
2008-03-18T20:28:00.000Z	Breth		Oh, I misread
2008-03-18T20:29:00.000Z	Breth		I'm running the memtest
2008-03-18T20:29:00.000Z	Breth		what should i look for
2008-03-18T20:31:00.000Z	Breth		Ok, I'll download that
2008-03-18T20:32:00.000Z	Breth		thanks for the help
2008-03-18T20:32:00.000Z	_2	Breth	no 64m won't do for that type install.     if you can barrow enough to install you can run in that tho.
2008-03-18T20:22:00.000Z	_2	Breth	sounds like it's not booting properly.   you would normally never be in a "busybox" shell
2008-03-18T20:23:00.000Z	_2	Breth	that normally occures when the kernel can't find/mount the root fs.
2008-03-18T20:23:00.000Z	_2	Breth	and if that's the case safe mode wont help.
2008-03-18T20:25:00.000Z	_2	Breth	yeah   it's not booting.
2008-03-18T20:25:00.000Z	_2	Breth	nope
2008-03-18T20:26:00.000Z	_2	Breth	more likely a bad disk   but possably very odd hardware setup that the live CD can't find itself in.
2008-03-18T20:28:00.000Z	_2	Breth	old != odd    it would be more likely to be a hardware issue with brand new hardware.
2008-03-18T20:29:00.000Z	_2	Breth	you say the hardware is old    do you have enough ram to run the install cd ?
2008-03-18T20:31:00.000Z	_2	Breth	ubuntu installer is a ram hog     you can run an installed ubuntu in less than 32m   but you need like upwards 256m to use the latest live
2008-03-18T20:31:00.000Z	Breth	_2	I just checked... I don't have enough ram: only 64...
2008-03-18T20:34:00.000Z	_2	Breth	xubuntu is by default a lighter system than ubuntu or kubuntu     but an old linux hand can make light what ubuntu has made heavy.
