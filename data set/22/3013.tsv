2009-01-04T06:48:00.000Z	webbhawk_h4x0r42		i run ubuntu on my home pc, but im not at home and on a windows machine.. and it seems to be infected with virus's... im wanting to do some work from this pc but be safe. I dont want my pwd's getting stolen or anyting and was wondering if i used ubuntu live cd.. would the possible virus's not be run from teh windows
2009-01-04T06:49:00.000Z	webbhawk_h4x0r42		hope that makes sense
2009-01-04T06:49:00.000Z	wj32	webbhawk_h4x0r42	Ubuntu won't get infected just because Windows has a virus
2009-01-04T06:49:00.000Z	wj32	webbhawk_h4x0r42	the rule with computers is there's no black magic
2009-01-04T06:49:00.000Z	wj32	webbhawk_h4x0r42	Windows programs don't run on Ubuntu
2009-01-04T06:50:00.000Z	wj32	webbhawk_h4x0r42	Viruses, trojans, and spyware are windows programs
2009-01-04T06:50:00.000Z	wj32	webbhawk_h4x0r42	Therefore viruses, trojans and spyware won't run on Ubuntu
2009-01-04T06:50:00.000Z	wj32	webbhawk_h4x0r42	Again, no black magic
2009-01-04T06:50:00.000Z	webbhawk_h4x0r42	wj32	 so i thought right.. it would be much safer this way
2009-01-04T06:50:00.000Z	webbhawk_h4x0r42	wj32	i didnt get that saying you said.. no black magic one...
2009-01-04T06:51:00.000Z	wj32	webbhawk_h4x0r42	oh its just that some people think that computers do magical things
2009-01-04T06:51:00.000Z	wj32	webbhawk_h4x0r42	never mind
2009-01-04T06:51:00.000Z	wj32	webbhawk_h4x0r42	what i said wasn't entirely true because there might be viruses and spyware for linux in the future
2009-01-04T06:51:00.000Z	webbhawk_h4x0r42	wj32	kk.. so i would be safe.. even if windows was infected
2009-01-04T06:52:00.000Z	wj32	webbhawk_h4x0r42	but right now there's no viruses and spyware for linux (probably 1 or 2 actually)
2009-01-04T06:52:00.000Z	webbhawk_h4x0r42	wj32	 really u think so.. virus's for linux ?
2009-01-04T06:52:00.000Z	wj32	webbhawk_h4x0r42	i mean in the wild
2009-01-04T06:52:00.000Z	webbhawk_h4x0r42	wj32	 u think it could be possible in the future
2009-01-04T06:55:00.000Z	wj32	webbhawk_h4x0r42	i recommend you install ubuntu!
2009-01-04T06:56:00.000Z	wj32	webbhawk_h4x0r42	oh i see
2009-01-04T06:57:00.000Z	wj32	webbhawk_h4x0r42	well if ubuntu crashes for some reason you're going to lose all your work
