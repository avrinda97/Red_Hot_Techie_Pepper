2008-12-15T02:41:00.000Z	Flannel	onetinsoldier	raylu: lsb_release should work by default.  lsb_release -a
2008-12-15T02:43:00.000Z	Flannel	onetinsoldier	right, lsb_release -a
2008-12-22T13:22:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Flannel	dpkg on his system is hosed right now.
2008-12-22T13:23:00.000Z	Flannel	onetinsoldier	It's not the end of the world actually.
2008-12-22T13:23:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Flannel	no.. but he won't be able to do anything at all with apt or dpkg until that's fixed
2008-12-23T08:40:00.000Z	Flannel	onetinsoldier	neutral: "every several minutes" -- He means 15-25
2008-12-23T08:40:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Flannel	hehe
2008-12-25T02:41:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Flannel	he's already upgraded
2008-12-25T02:42:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Flannel	apparently there's a question of whether his 'entire'(perhaps customized) file has been completely switched to intrepid
2008-12-25T02:45:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Flannel	hello, i have something to say if you care to hear it ;-)
2008-12-25T02:49:00.000Z	Flannel	onetinsoldier	Of course
2008-12-25T02:52:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Flannel	i had a 'newb' come here yesterday that wanted to upgrade from hardy to intrepid, but couldn't seem to do it the usual way. (update manager?). someone told them that a major upgrade like that is not supported on an LTS release through the update manager or something to that effect. do you know about this?
2008-12-25T02:53:00.000Z	Flannel	onetinsoldier	With LTS releases, you need to go to software sources, and choose that you want all (non-LTS) stable upgrades.  There' three options actually.  One is just LTS, the other is non-LTS (or, 'every' release) and the last is don't notify me, if I remember correctly
2008-12-25T02:53:00.000Z	Flannel	onetinsoldier	That way if you're on Hardy, you can choose to wait for 10.04 before being asked about upgrading
2008-12-25T02:54:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Flannel	so i told them that, as a former plain old debian user that had upgraded from stable to unstable a few times, i knew how to do it manually. so, they went for it with my sed command, and then did a dist-upgrade. it worked fine for them... just an fyi
2008-12-25T02:54:00.000Z	Flannel	onetinsoldier	There's nothing saying manually won't work fine.  You just have to make sure you have the proper metapackages installed (ubuntu-minimal, ubuntu-standard, an appropriate kernel metapackage, and their appropriate -desktop metapackage, if applicable)
2008-12-25T02:55:00.000Z	Flannel	onetinsoldier	update-manager just makes sure everything is in order, and does some other sanity checks and things like that for added safety
2008-12-25T02:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Flannel	ok, i'll keep tha in mind. i did look over both their hardy and the new sources.list files before i had them do the dist-upgrade to try to determine if anything looked out of pplace.. look good to me so i said go for it
2010-05-30T09:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Flannel	can you help? does tristan3199's hostname look ok in both those files i had him/her display up above? so that his/her 'sudo' won't have any issues? looks ok i think
2010-05-30T09:18:00.000Z	Flannel	onetinsoldier	tristan3199 Doesn't have a hostname issue, sudo is working just fine
2010-05-30T09:19:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Flannel	roger. just needed to make sure that wasn't the issue
2010-05-31T12:00:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Flannel	thank you for getting rid of mr. rubin
