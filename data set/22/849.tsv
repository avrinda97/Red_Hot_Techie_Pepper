2011-11-18T11:28:00.000Z	excelsio1		what's the best linux for a 256 MB computer?
2011-11-18T11:29:00.000Z	Quontrex	excelsio1	give me a second there is a 386 compile for it
2011-11-18T11:29:00.000Z	excelsio1		Yeah, but what about office software and maybe accounting software or edubuntu games?
2011-11-18T11:29:00.000Z	Quontrex		excelsio1; sudo apt-get install linux-image-386
2011-11-18T11:30:00.000Z	Quontrex		might try fluxbuntu
2011-11-18T11:30:00.000Z	excelsio1	Quontrex	I have no idea what that will do. Can you explain?
2011-11-18T11:30:00.000Z	excelsio1		What about DSL or Puppy?
2011-11-18T11:31:00.000Z	Quontrex		yeah dsl will work for him
2011-11-18T11:31:00.000Z	excelsio1		seems like Puppy was buggy on my old 256 machine
2011-11-18T11:31:00.000Z	Quontrex		was trying to keep him in the family
2011-11-18T11:31:00.000Z	Quontrex		I use fluxbuntu on a 200mmx 64mb laptop as my jukebox
2011-11-18T11:32:00.000Z	excelsio1		can dsl do the educational software for me? (if not buggy, run out of mem too quick)
2011-11-18T11:32:00.000Z	Quontrex		DSL is damn small linux, and therefore you get damn small features
2011-11-18T11:33:00.000Z	excelsio1		yeah... so I guess I just need to keep asking for more computers.
2011-11-18T11:33:00.000Z	Quontrex	excelsio1	can you email me the specs?
2011-11-18T11:33:00.000Z	excelsio1		probably, one sec
2011-11-18T11:34:00.000Z	Quontrex		actually just put the specs out here
2011-11-18T11:35:00.000Z	Quontrex		quite
2011-11-18T11:36:00.000Z	excelsio1		dell dimension, 2100, xp, 256 MB Ram, 1,096Mhz processor, 37 GB HD, 16 Free.
2011-11-18T11:37:00.000Z	excelsio1		DCC CHAT in irssi?
2011-11-18T11:37:00.000Z	excelsio1		what's that?
2011-11-18T11:37:00.000Z	Quontrex	excelsio1	its safe
