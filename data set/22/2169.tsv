2009-09-12T02:40:00.000Z	six		can anyone help?
2009-09-12T02:40:00.000Z	kholzer	six	read what ubottu just said.
2009-09-12T02:41:00.000Z	kholzer	six	???  not the ask, one line before.
2009-09-12T02:42:00.000Z	kholzer	six	read those instructions, thats how you do that :)
2009-09-12T02:42:00.000Z	kholzer	six	it won't be on the livecd, it will all be on the usb disk
2009-09-12T02:42:00.000Z	kholzer	six	you need to read both.
2009-09-12T02:44:00.000Z	kholzer	six	or use the just following: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromUSB
2009-09-12T03:00:00.000Z	kholzer	six	pick one
2009-09-12T03:00:00.000Z	kholzer	six	One is over the internet, the other is through your CD drive...right?
2009-09-12T03:10:00.000Z	six	kholzer	i am currently downloading, - are you sure this is what is best for my situation?
2009-09-12T03:10:00.000Z	kholzer	six	downloading the cd?  It should work fine.
2009-09-12T03:10:00.000Z	kholzer	six	Either way will work.
2009-09-12T03:11:00.000Z	kholzer	six	the goal is just to get a bunch of files onto a usb-disk (and configure a few of them for your hardware and stuff).  It ought to work.
2009-09-12T03:11:00.000Z	six	kholzer	yes, i am now on a laptop running windows with the usb attached to it, and my other PC is without any HDD, and i want to run ubuntu from the usb for a few days until i get a new HDD
2009-09-12T03:12:00.000Z	kholzer	six	or you could follow this: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/linux/create-a-bootable-ubuntu-usb-flash-drive-the-easy-way/ guide...
2009-09-12T03:12:00.000Z	kholzer	six	looks easy enough
2009-09-12T03:13:00.000Z	six	kholzer	looks like the same as i am doing, but english is not my native langauge so i am just asking to be sure that this is correct solution for me
2009-09-12T03:14:00.000Z	six	kholzer	btw i got the UNetbootin doing the .iso download because when i try it just stucks at 137mb as completed (unetbootin source is: http://releases.ubuntu.com/9.04/ubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386.iso)
2009-09-12T03:15:00.000Z	kholzer	six	it will work fine.
2009-09-12T03:16:00.000Z	kholzer	six	Just try it.  Come back here if it doesn't work, okay?
2009-09-12T03:20:00.000Z	six	kholzer	thanks alot
