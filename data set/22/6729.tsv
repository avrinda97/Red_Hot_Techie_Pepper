2007-12-05T13:49:00.000Z	triplc		How to select Chinese font for BlueFish?
2007-12-05T13:50:00.000Z	triplc		How to select Chinese font for BlueFish? I am using "ordinary font" for other stuff... but went it comes to Chiense text... it just selects the urgly font somewhere I don't know
2007-12-05T13:51:00.000Z	sladen	triplc	it's probably taking place at a lower level
2007-12-05T13:51:00.000Z	sladen	triplc	eg. a request is made for some text to written in the default font
2007-12-05T13:51:00.000Z	sladen	triplc	and if the default font does not contain those glyphs, they will be transparently fetched from another font
2007-12-05T13:51:00.000Z	triplc	sladen	ok... lower level... but please tell me where I can set it
2007-12-05T13:52:00.000Z	sladen	triplc	System->Prefences->Appearance->Fonts?
2007-12-05T13:53:00.000Z	triplc	sladen	hmm... no... that preference just only allow to select "one" font.
2007-12-05T13:53:00.000Z	sladen	triplc	...the default font?
2007-12-05T13:54:00.000Z	sladen	triplc	Bluefish may have it's own choice as to what default font to install
2007-12-05T13:54:00.000Z	sladen	triplc	remember that most web-text /does not/ specify a font
2007-12-05T13:54:00.000Z	triplc	sladen	actually, I am not using GNOME, I use Fluxbox... please me the program to run... not that meny
2007-12-05T13:55:00.000Z	sladen	triplc	gnome-appearance-properties, I think.
2007-12-05T13:58:00.000Z	triplc	sladen	gnome-appearance-properties does not work, i am sorry
2007-12-05T13:58:00.000Z	sladen	triplc	sorry.  Perhaps you could ask fluxbox people if you've chosen to use that
2007-12-05T13:59:00.000Z	sladen	triplc	I do not know BlueFish, but I suspect there are menus containing preferences
2007-12-05T13:59:00.000Z	sladen	triplc	that would work for you.  Remember that when you put the page on the web, you will not be able to choose the fonts that the person reading the page has
2007-12-05T14:00:00.000Z	triplc	sladen	ah... fluxbox does not do anything about that... it is just a Window Manager... and it does not care about most of other things that Gnome/KDE do... anyway, thanks for your helps and patient :-)
2007-12-05T14:00:00.000Z	sladen	triplc	if it's a case of the Chinese font that comes up by default "not looking good", then your skills and advice on improving that centrally for the whole of *buntu would be greatefully received
2007-12-05T14:01:00.000Z	sladen	triplc	you can also select the default font from Firefox, for when you view the completed page, is that what you were after?
2007-12-05T14:02:00.000Z	triplc	sladen	I know about Firefox font settings, which contains setting different fonts for different charset... i only hit problem with bluefish which does not have that
