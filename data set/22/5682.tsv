2007-03-19T13:07:00.000Z	Jenn		Hi there
2007-03-19T13:07:00.000Z	Jenn		holy... so many people.
2007-03-19T13:07:00.000Z	Jenn		Can anyone help me? I'm new to linux.
2007-03-19T13:07:00.000Z	lugod	Jenn	maybe. What's your specific need?
2007-03-19T13:09:00.000Z	lugod	Jenn	have you set your BIOS to boot up from the CD drive?
2007-03-19T13:10:00.000Z	lugod	Jenn	do you see anything happening before the blank screen?
2007-03-19T13:11:00.000Z	lugod	Jenn	you have have unusual video hardware that the automatic probing used by the live CD can't deal with
2007-03-19T13:11:00.000Z	lugod	Jenn	there are some options for 'safe video' in the boot-up menu of the live CD
2007-03-19T13:12:00.000Z	lugod	Jenn	also there is a CD-image called 'altinstall' that does not attempt to use graphics (it boots in text-mode with menus) that in my experience always works even when the regular CD fails due to video problems
2007-03-19T13:12:00.000Z	lugod	Jenn	I see. Well the alternate image is probably your best bet then
2007-03-19T13:13:00.000Z	lugod	Jenn	do you mean what commands to burn the CD?
2007-03-19T13:15:00.000Z	lugod	Jenn	you shouldn't need any special commands with the altinstall image; it's supposed to boot directly into the installer which will start asking you installation questions in menu form
2007-03-19T13:16:00.000Z	lugod	Jenn	looking up URL
2007-03-19T13:16:00.000Z	Jenn	lugod	where can I get that 'altinstall' image?
2007-03-19T13:17:00.000Z	lugod	Jenn	http://ubuntu.mirrors.imagepile.net/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-alternate-i386.iso
2007-03-19T13:17:00.000Z	lugod	Jenn	which is linked from here: http://www.ubuntu.com/GetUbuntu/downloadmirrors
2007-03-19T13:19:00.000Z	Jenn	lugod	Can I say you rock! :P
2007-03-19T13:19:00.000Z	lugod	Jenn	thanks :)
2007-03-19T13:19:00.000Z	Jenn	lugod	So I burn this image, right?
2007-03-19T13:19:00.000Z	lugod	Jenn	yes, then boot it :)
2007-03-19T13:23:00.000Z	Jenn	lugod	are you still there?
2007-03-19T13:23:00.000Z	lugod	Jenn	back now
