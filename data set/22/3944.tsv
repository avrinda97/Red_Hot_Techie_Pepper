2008-11-08T05:32:00.000Z	icqnumber	linkmaster03	ok thank you for the hint
2008-11-08T05:19:00.000Z	linkmaster03	icqnumber	looks like a proprietary codec
2008-11-08T05:19:00.000Z	linkmaster03	icqnumber	do you have the medibuntu repo enabled?
2008-11-08T05:19:00.000Z	icqnumber	linkmaster03	yep
2008-11-08T05:19:00.000Z	linkmaster03	icqnumber	sudo apt-get install w32codecs
2008-11-08T05:20:00.000Z	icqnumber	linkmaster03	i have it installed but ...no luck
2008-11-08T05:21:00.000Z	linkmaster03	icqnumber	what is the file you are trying to play and through what video player?
2008-11-08T05:22:00.000Z	icqnumber	linkmaster03	http://cluster.quantumart.ru/broadcast/default.aspx?media=rusradio stream totem(gstreamer)
2008-11-08T05:22:00.000Z	icqnumber	linkmaster03	looks like it works for other people, but not for me
2008-11-08T05:24:00.000Z	linkmaster03	icqnumber	i'm looking at it
2008-11-08T05:25:00.000Z	linkmaster03	icqnumber	well it's x-ms-asf, so it should play as long as totem and gstreamer and w32codecs are installed.. hm
2008-11-08T05:25:00.000Z	icqnumber	linkmaster03	ok thank you
2008-11-08T05:25:00.000Z	icqnumber	linkmaster03	do it works for you
2008-11-08T05:27:00.000Z	linkmaster03	icqnumber	no but i'm running vlc plugin
2008-11-08T05:27:00.000Z	linkmaster03	icqnumber	don't know what to tell you, incredibly sorry
2008-11-08T05:27:00.000Z	icqnumber	linkmaster03	do not you have totem or banshee installed
2008-11-08T05:28:00.000Z	linkmaster03	icqnumber	nope, i replaced them with vlc, too much bloat for me
2008-11-08T05:28:00.000Z	icqnumber	linkmaster03	it works in vlc for me, but not in totem
2008-11-08T05:30:00.000Z	linkmaster03	icqnumber	ohh i didn't know it was music
2008-11-08T05:30:00.000Z	linkmaster03	icqnumber	yes it does work with the vlc plugin for me
2008-11-08T05:30:00.000Z	linkmaster03	icqnumber	i don't know about totem though
