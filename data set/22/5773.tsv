2007-03-06T11:01:00.000Z	Crell		OK, is anyone here running a jabber server on Edgy-Server, and able to recommend it?
2007-03-06T11:02:00.000Z	jlgaddis	Crell	not ubuntu, but running an enterprise jabber server on debian
2007-03-06T11:02:00.000Z	Crell		I'm just looking for a single-server solution, but MUC, audio, and video (if available in the client) would be good.
2007-03-06T11:02:00.000Z	Crell	jlgaddis	Define "enterprise jabber server".
2007-03-06T11:02:00.000Z	Crell		I doubt I'll have more than a dozen users, maximum.
2007-03-06T11:02:00.000Z	jlgaddis	Crell	a jabber installation supporting 107k+ users?
2007-03-06T11:03:00.000Z	Crell		I used to use ejabberd, but for some reason it's gone belly up and refuses to even give me useful error messages.
2007-03-06T11:03:00.000Z	Crell	jlgaddis	Yeah, way out of the league I need. :-)
2007-03-06T11:03:00.000Z	Crell		Which server?
2007-03-06T11:03:00.000Z	Crell	jlgaddis	Which jabber server, specifically?
2007-03-06T11:04:00.000Z	jlgaddis	Crell	jabberd 2.x branch, it's at an .edu.  we don't ever have that many concurrent users of course.
2007-03-06T11:04:00.000Z	Crell		How is it for setup and config?
2007-03-06T11:04:00.000Z	Crell		When I was last looking into jabber servers 2 years ago, IIRC jabber 2.x was rather shaky.
2007-03-06T11:04:00.000Z	jlgaddis	Crell	not bad, was able to delegate it out to someone else and he managed to get it working
2007-03-06T11:05:00.000Z	Crell	jlgaddis	"managed".  That doesn't instill confidence. ;-)
2007-03-06T11:05:00.000Z	jlgaddis	Crell	you don't know him.  =)
2007-03-06T11:05:00.000Z	Crell		hehe.
2007-03-06T11:05:00.000Z	jlgaddis	Crell	jabberd supported ldap and postgresql, both of which we needed
2007-03-06T11:05:00.000Z	Crell		And of course only jabber 1.x is in the edgy repository.
2007-03-06T11:05:00.000Z	Crell	jlgaddis	I doubt I'll be using either, although good to know if I ever setup LDAP just to see if I can.
2007-03-06T11:06:00.000Z	Crell	jlgaddis	Is this the "JOSS" server?
2007-03-06T11:09:00.000Z	Crell	jlgaddis	Is this the "JOSS" server?
