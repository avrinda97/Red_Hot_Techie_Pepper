2008-07-24T15:21:00.000Z	ed0n0n		What if the updgrade goes on forever?
2008-07-24T15:21:00.000Z	ed0n0n		is there any way to updgrade, but without locale
2008-07-24T15:21:00.000Z	ed0n0n		?
2008-07-24T15:21:00.000Z	bazhang	ed0n0n	why do you care about that
2008-07-24T15:23:00.000Z	ed0n0n	bazhang	I am upgrading, but localedef is going forever, and the updgrade is not finishing, when it was suppossed to be finished in ten minutes. Localedef --no-archive... takes all the CPU and never ends... What can I do to continue or stop upgrade?
2008-07-24T15:24:00.000Z	bazhang	ed0n0n	how long
2008-07-24T15:25:00.000Z	ed0n0n	bazhang	its been like this like two hours
2008-07-24T15:27:00.000Z	ed0n0n	bazhang	my locale is not supossed to be en_AU.UTF-8, I have es_EU.UTF-8. Is maybe a problem for that?
2008-07-24T15:27:00.000Z	bazhang	ed0n0n	not really, can be changed later.
2008-07-24T15:28:00.000Z	ed0n0n	bazhang	how could I "jump" this update process and continue with the rest?
2008-07-24T15:28:00.000Z	bazhang	ed0n0n	is it configuring or still downloading
2008-07-24T15:29:00.000Z	ed0n0n	bazhang	it is configuring
2008-07-24T15:29:00.000Z	ed0n0n	bazhang	nearly finished, it says ten minutes left
2008-07-24T15:29:00.000Z	bazhang	ed0n0n	let it run then
2008-07-24T15:29:00.000Z	ed0n0n	bazhang	ten minutes are already 2 hours
2008-07-24T15:30:00.000Z	bazhang	ed0n0n	the configuring sequence is not to be lightly interrupted
2008-07-24T15:30:00.000Z	ed0n0n	bazhang	it cannot be, never seen sucha long install of anything. It must be a bug
2008-07-24T15:52:00.000Z	bazhang	ed0n0n	no need for sudo with apt-cache search
2008-07-24T15:52:00.000Z	ed0n0n	bazhang	:D it's just in case
2008-12-18T19:58:00.000Z	ed0n0n	bazhang	I mean FROM USB instead of TO USB, the CD drive seems to be not working, no network, so USB would be a good solution
2008-12-18T20:01:00.000Z	ed0n0n	bazhang	This link is what I needed, thank you :D
2008-12-18T22:53:00.000Z	bazhang	ed0n0n	for a demo perhaps, better to try the livecd
