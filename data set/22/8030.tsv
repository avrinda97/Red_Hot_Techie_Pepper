2006-12-29T08:28:00.000Z	ken	LjL	"Software is like sex; it's better when it's free." --Linus Torvalds" Are such quotes allowed in this channel? :)
2006-12-29T08:28:00.000Z	LjL	ken	*shrug*, when they're in a quit message... it's hard to draw the line
2006-12-29T08:30:00.000Z	ken	LjL	How do i make a folder in Ubuntu, that every user is able to read/write, ever user can make sub-directories in it and paste whatever files and delete everything? Basically a kind of shared folder?
2006-12-29T08:35:00.000Z	LjL	ken	you probably want to create a group (say, "netshare"), make all the users that you want to access the directory members of that group, and then set that directory's setuid-group bit
2006-12-29T08:39:00.000Z	LjL	ken	saw my message? it came a bit late. but is the idea clear?
2006-12-29T08:40:00.000Z	ken	LjL	Yes i got the idea about making a group, and sharing the privileges with the group
2006-12-29T08:40:00.000Z	ken	LjL	The only thing i dont understand is this : set that directory's setuid-group bit
2006-12-29T08:41:00.000Z	LjL	ken	well the important point is making the directory setgid. that means that any files that are created inside the directory get the group of the *directory*, and not of the user creating them (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid )
2006-12-29T08:42:00.000Z	ken	LjL	I am really learning Linux, now :)
2006-12-29T08:47:00.000Z	ken	LjL	CPU=3gHz intel PIV, RAM=256MB, SWAP=750MB runs sluggish at times. please help tim167
2006-12-29T08:49:00.000Z	LjL	ken	tim167: well if you're using the GIMP and OOo, and "only" have 256Mb of RAM (yeah, i know, the "only" is unfortunate and a bit ridiculous, but), i'm not too surprised that things go sluggish.  but *what* is sluggish exactly? you get high CPU load, high I/O usage, high swap space usage, or all of them?
2006-12-29T08:54:00.000Z	ken	LjL	stefg: What configuration (cpu-speed, hdd-size, RAM) would you term recommended and minimum for Ubuntu
2006-12-29T08:55:00.000Z	LjL	ken	IMHO 256Mb is good enough, but barely. i'd never go below 192Mb. still, if you use memory-intensive applications, 256Mb is still quite little, and anyway, again, a 3GHz processor is totally wasted with that little RAM, for desktop purposes
2006-12-29T09:01:00.000Z	ken	LjL	stefg: Would using Xubuntu help tim167, to stop those moments of 'freezes' that he experiences when opening resource-heavy apps?
2006-12-29T09:04:00.000Z	LjL	ken	tim167: maybe, but only if he changes his choice of applications. using Xubuntu and then full-blown GNOME apps on it wouldn't make much sense, since most/all of the GNOME libraries would still be used
2006-12-29T09:04:00.000Z	ken	LjL	stefg: Help: When i open some window or some window is opened by defualt by a application (eg. firefox messages). Than a Oval (ellipsoid) really small ellipsoid opens up, on stretching it out with a mouse, one sees that it is a window that is empty (it shouldn't, there was some problem that caused a empty small window), so when one stretched out that ellipsoid than a empty window is seen, which should actually have been a decent sized notification message. Thi
2006-12-29T09:04:00.000Z	ken	LjL	not even GIMP?
2006-12-29T09:05:00.000Z	LjL	ken	no. actually,
2006-12-29T09:05:00.000Z	LjL	ken	GTK was *created* for the GIMP, and it still just uses GTK directly
2006-12-29T09:06:00.000Z	LjL	ken	i have no idea what you're talking about there, honestly :o)
