2004-11-07T09:44:00.000Z	kapputu		hello everyone
2004-11-07T09:45:00.000Z	kapputu		hi GotDot what's up
2004-11-07T09:46:00.000Z	kapputu		i'm trying to get sound card support for 440 BX
2004-11-07T09:46:00.000Z	kapputu		I convinced my roommate to install linux
2004-11-07T09:46:00.000Z	kapputu		he is an electrical engineer
2004-11-07T09:47:00.000Z	kapputu		but i can't install his sound card
2004-11-07T09:47:00.000Z	kapputu		and he is kinda pissed off
2004-11-07T09:47:00.000Z	kapputu		he listens to a lot of music
2004-11-07T09:47:00.000Z	brettcar	kapputu	He could wire himself up a new one quick like ;)
2004-11-08T07:14:00.000Z	brettcar	kapputu	Nope
2004-11-08T07:14:00.000Z	brettcar	kapputu	;)
2004-11-08T07:15:00.000Z	brettcar	kapputu	Try: mount -a
2004-11-08T07:18:00.000Z	brettcar	kapputu	Yes, if it wasn't mounted before you can just mount it normally (mount /mount/point) and it'll be fine
2004-11-08T07:33:00.000Z	brettcar	kapputu	You'd have to repartition
2004-11-08T07:33:00.000Z	brettcar	kapputu	And reinstall
2004-11-08T08:19:00.000Z	brettcar	kapputu	If it isn't a driver problem, a better AP or antenna on your card.
2004-11-08T08:21:00.000Z	brettcar	kapputu	Buy one? :)
2004-11-08T08:21:00.000Z	brettcar	kapputu	Make one? :)
2004-11-08T08:22:00.000Z	brettcar	kapputu	Maybe you could get a book of WiFi technology to read up more about how wireless radio works?
2004-11-09T17:54:00.000Z	brettcar	kapputu	Why yes I happen to be around
2004-11-09T17:54:00.000Z	brettcar	kapputu	Nothing, just run apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade
2004-11-09T06:52:00.000Z	brettcar	kapputu	Yeah I'm wrong.
