2005-08-25T14:45:00.000Z	kamme		hello, I've got a little problem, every time some screensaver kicks in, it freezes my whole system, ctrl-alt-del and ctrl-alt backspace don't work or anything... is there anything I can do to solve that?
2005-08-25T14:45:00.000Z	aeruder	kamme	gl screensaver?
2005-08-25T14:45:00.000Z	kamme	aeruder	I think so, I'm not sure and I can't look because it freezes on me
2005-08-25T14:46:00.000Z	aeruder	kamme	xscreensaver-demo
2005-08-25T14:46:00.000Z	aeruder	kamme	try a non gl one, it is possible gl support is just messed up?
2005-08-25T14:47:00.000Z	kamme	aeruder	I didn't change anything with the gl stuff... But the problem is, I can't even change the screensaver, even the screensaver option program freezes everything...
2005-08-25T14:47:00.000Z	aeruder	kamme	hard locks the entire system?
2005-08-25T14:47:00.000Z	aeruder	kamme	can you still ssh in ?
2005-08-25T14:47:00.000Z	kamme	aeruder	yup
2005-08-25T14:48:00.000Z	kamme	aeruder	didn't try that, but my guess is no
2005-08-25T14:48:00.000Z	kamme	aeruder	since even my wlan card stops blinking
2005-08-25T14:48:00.000Z	aeruder	kamme	eek
2005-08-25T14:48:00.000Z	kamme	aeruder	tell me about it...
2005-08-25T14:51:00.000Z	aeruder	kamme	it is just a package that depends on all the other packages needed for a full system
2005-08-25T14:51:00.000Z	aeruder	kamme	apt-cache show ubuntu-desktop
2005-08-25T14:51:00.000Z	aeruder	kamme	and look at the depends field
2005-08-25T14:51:00.000Z	kamme	aeruder	so it can be removed? (that way I can remove xscreensaver-gl too
2005-08-25T14:51:00.000Z	aeruder	kamme	you could also just disable xscreensaver you know ;)
2005-08-25T14:51:00.000Z	aeruder	kamme	sure, remove it
2005-08-25T14:51:00.000Z	aeruder	kamme	it is just a meta package that pulls in the rest
2005-08-25T14:52:00.000Z	aeruder	kamme	if you remove it, all the ones it brought in stay around :)
2005-08-25T14:53:00.000Z	kamme	aeruder	that solved it.. so if anyone has the same problem you know what to do :)
