2007-03-10T07:43:00.000Z	vox754	PirateHead	do you use LILO?
2007-03-10T07:44:00.000Z	PirateHead	vox754	I have tried it, but I use GRUB.
2007-03-18T15:12:00.000Z	vox754	PirateHead	what syntax
2007-03-18T15:13:00.000Z	PirateHead	vox754	www.byond.com's "DM" language.
2007-03-18T15:13:00.000Z	vox754	PirateHead	I don't know, but I would be interested to know how to do it. You can try contacting the developers.
2007-04-15T12:21:00.000Z	vox754	PirateHead	which kernel, which Ubuntu? If you are using ndiswrapper or something else that you compiled, you need to recompile it.
2007-04-15T12:21:00.000Z	PirateHead	vox754	I'm using Ubuntu Edgy, and last night my Ubuntu update manager recommended that I upgrade to 2.6.17-11-generic
2007-04-15T12:22:00.000Z	PirateHead	vox754	I am not using ndiswrapper.
2007-04-15T12:22:00.000Z	vox754	PirateHead	have you tried the previous kernel, to see if it still works?
2007-04-15T12:23:00.000Z	PirateHead	vox754	I do not know how to do that, but it sounds like a good idea. Can you clue me in? =D
2007-04-15T12:25:00.000Z	vox754	PirateHead	if you upgraded the kernel to 2.6.17-11, then there must still be a 2.6.17-10 option in the grub menu, just pick that one
2007-04-15T12:25:00.000Z	PirateHead	vox754	I will try looking in Grub.
2007-04-15T12:26:00.000Z	vox754	PirateHead	you can view the kernels you have under /boot, so don't delete anything in it
2007-04-15T12:34:00.000Z	PirateHead	vox754	I am now using the older kernel version, and my wireless works. That confirms my suspicion that the kernel upgrade killed the wireless driver -- but I still don't know what to do about that .
2007-04-15T12:35:00.000Z	vox754	PirateHead	which card? Thar surely is a problem with the correct drivers or modules, like rt2500 or bcm43xx or ndiswrapper.
2007-04-15T12:35:00.000Z	PirateHead	vox754	It's an Atheros card. I don't know what a .ko file is, pokoko.
2007-04-15T12:36:00.000Z	vox754	PirateHead	maybe you are using madwifi and you need to reinstall
2007-04-15T12:37:00.000Z	PirateHead	vox754	pokoko: there is a madwifi driver in my /lib/modules/2.6.17-10-generic folder
2007-04-15T12:38:00.000Z	vox754	PirateHead	as you see, you need that module also for the newer kernel
2007-04-15T12:39:00.000Z	PirateHead	vox754	I think you are on the right track here. =D
2007-04-15T12:41:00.000Z	PirateHead	vox754	pokoko: should I try compiling madwifi from source, or should I try copying the .ko files from the old kernel?
2007-04-15T12:41:00.000Z	vox754	PirateHead	usually when you get something from source it gets compiled against specific kernel headers, so the modules get correctly installed. I would say you need to do exactly what you did in the first place to get your card working, or maybe just copying the .ko will solve it.
