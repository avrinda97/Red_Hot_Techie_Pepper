2007-09-24T12:44:00.000Z	CyberMad		does anyone here have experience with mounting windows shared folder on ubuntu?
2007-09-24T12:45:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CyberMad	of course, first sudo apt-get install smbfs
2007-09-24T12:46:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CyberMad	change cifs to smbfs (also install smbfs)
2007-09-24T12:46:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CyberMad	sudo gedit /etc/fstab
2007-09-24T12:47:00.000Z	CyberMad	MasterShrek	ok, then?
2007-09-24T12:47:00.000Z	CyberMad	MasterShrek	do you have the command to login with username and password?
2007-09-24T12:48:00.000Z	CyberMad	MasterShrek	or just change cifs to smbfs will solve the problem? //172.168.100.200/Tour /mnt/Tour smbfs auto,user,username=operation02,workgroup=WORKGROUP ,password=product,uid=500,gid=500,file_mode=0777,d ir_mode=0777,rw 0 0
2007-09-24T12:48:00.000Z	CyberMad	MasterShrek	i will test it now
2007-09-24T12:49:00.000Z	CyberMad	MasterShrek	btw, thanks a lot for help me.. i already investigate this problem about 3 days..
2007-09-24T12:58:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CyberMad	did that work?
2007-09-27T10:31:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CyberMad	i dont think u need the fmask or dmask options
2007-11-28T06:13:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CyberMad	do you want them to not be able to run any windows apps or just certain ones?
2007-12-06T10:40:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CyberMad	why would you want to? xp is ugly
2007-12-06T10:41:00.000Z	CyberMad	MasterShrek	because we do migration from XP to ubuntu about 1 week and some users not suitable with it
2007-12-06T10:48:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CyberMad	i dont think so
2007-12-06T10:50:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CyberMad	apt-get purge
2007-12-06T10:51:00.000Z	CyberMad	MasterShrek	do you mean apt-get purge <packagename>, example: apt-get purge wine ??
2007-12-06T10:52:00.000Z	CyberMad	MasterShrek	thanks
2007-12-06T10:53:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CyberMad	no problem
2007-12-06T10:56:00.000Z	MasterShrek	CyberMad	it saves the actual pacakage i think, apt-get remove will remove the binaries, and docs and stuff, purge will remove all configuration files too
2007-12-06T10:58:00.000Z	CyberMad	MasterShrek	so, apt-get install wine... will save the package to /var/apt/cache, then do apt-get remove wine just uninstall the program, but not delete the config and cache files,.. for complete removal / uninstallation apt-get purge wine, correct? :) thanks all guru!
2007-12-06T10:59:00.000Z	CyberMad	MasterShrek	thanks
