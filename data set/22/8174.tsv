2005-10-05T15:08:00.000Z	ubun2		im surprised ubuntu is running fast on my 64mb of ram machine
2005-10-05T15:08:00.000Z	ubun2		reminds me of the beos r5/r6 days
2005-10-05T15:09:00.000Z	ubun2		does anyone know whether i should convert ubuntu ext3 to ubuntu xfs/ubuntu reiserfs?
2005-10-05T15:09:00.000Z	ubun2		just for the sake of file system speed
2005-10-05T15:10:00.000Z	ubun2		i didn't do anything really
2005-10-05T15:10:00.000Z	ubun2		the only thing i use is icewm because GNOME is a ram hog
2005-10-05T15:10:00.000Z	ubun2		they need to have DENU for ubuntu rather than denu for gentoo :-)
2005-10-05T15:11:00.000Z	Lars_G	ubun2	Try xfce4 it's wonderfull, as light as icewm, and more confortable to use
2005-10-05T15:11:00.000Z	ubun2	Lars_G	I did, I still like icewm+fvwm
2005-10-05T15:11:00.000Z	ubun2		thanks davmor2
2005-10-05T15:11:00.000Z	Lars_G	ubun2	Your choice, your right.
2005-10-05T15:12:00.000Z	ubun2	Lars_G	: this is probably the best form of linux i've ever used in my life and i would definitely keep using it.
2005-10-05T15:12:00.000Z	ubun2		flux is really good i agree
2005-10-05T15:12:00.000Z	Lars_G	ubun2	:D
2005-10-05T15:12:00.000Z	ubun2		but i cant get the menus right
2005-10-05T15:12:00.000Z	Lars_G		Flux is nice.
2005-10-05T15:12:00.000Z	Lars_G		But xfce is a little easier to config
2005-10-05T15:13:00.000Z	ubun2		on a 64mb of ram machine
2005-10-05T15:13:00.000Z	ubun2		whatever happened to enlightenment
2005-10-05T15:13:00.000Z	ubun2		LOL
2005-10-05T15:13:00.000Z	Lars_G	ubun2	I know, I ran fluxbox on my old 200Mhz 32Mb ram laptop
