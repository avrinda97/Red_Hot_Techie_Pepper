2012-11-01T08:41:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		hi, i have just installed ubuntu-server but i am unable to perform any root command due to "username is not in the sudoers list"
2012-11-01T08:41:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		what's the default password for root ?
2012-11-01T08:41:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FISH_SOUP	type "su" and press enter
2012-11-01T08:42:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		type su and press enter, it gives me authentication error
2012-11-01T08:43:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		it asked me for a password when doing so, but if its not given then how do i know whats the password?
2012-11-01T08:43:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		during installation, they ask you to provide a username and password
2012-11-01T08:44:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		other than that, nothing else
2012-11-01T08:44:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		so how do i install stuff if i cant even get down to root
2012-11-01T08:44:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP	wols	yes i understand
2012-11-01T08:44:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		but i cant sudo!
2012-11-01T08:45:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		it keeps giving me <username is not in the sudoers list>
2012-11-01T08:45:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		if i am not even in the sudoers list, how can i do what you asked
2012-11-01T08:45:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FISH_SOUP	reboot the computer, hold shift while it boots until you reach the grub menu. select Recovery. when you reach the prompt type without quote marks "passwd <newpasswordhere>" and that changes the root password so you can enter "su"
2012-11-01T08:45:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		yeah, bad install..even when clicking next all the way, it can "result" in bad install?
2012-11-01T08:46:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		reboot: needs to be root
2012-11-01T08:46:00.000Z	FISH_SOUP		lol

2012-11-01T08:48:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FISH_SOUP	get off your butt, go to the computer, and reboot it like a pro
2012-11-01T08:48:00.000Z	crimsonmane	FISH_SOUP	reboot the computer, hold shift while it boots until you reach the grub menu. select Recovery. when you reach the prompt type without quote marks "passwd <newpasswordhere>" and that changes the root password so you can enter "su"
