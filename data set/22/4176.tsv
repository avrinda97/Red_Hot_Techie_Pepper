2008-03-07T20:00:00.000Z	genii	hischild	Habit :)
2008-03-07T20:01:00.000Z	hischild	genii	yeah ... same here ... yet i accidentily removed a folder i shouldn remove ... :p thus i try to refrain from doing more then needed in terms of flags
2008-11-24T01:45:00.000Z	genii	hischild	-rw------- 1 username usergroup 378 2008-11-23 13:38 /home/username/.ICEauthority
2008-11-24T01:45:00.000Z	hischild	genii	you have my thanks. Let's see if setting those will still let me login.
2008-11-24T01:46:00.000Z	hischild	genii	could you give me another set of permissions? Those of the /home folder itself, not the contents.
2008-11-24T01:47:00.000Z	genii	hischild	/home/username/.ICEauthority           is a file and not a directory
2008-11-24T01:48:00.000Z	genii	hischild	The /home folder should be owned by root. The /home/username   dir should be owned by username
2008-11-24T01:48:00.000Z	hischild	genii	Yes. I've set those permissions and i can still login. However, having my entire home directory set to 777 isn't what i want, yet it has been the only way for me to be able to login.
2008-11-24T01:49:00.000Z	hischild	genii	despite that the /home/hischild is ownd by hischild and /home is owned by root, the permissions appear to have been changed.
2008-11-24T01:50:00.000Z	genii	hischild	Did you do something like run a gui app with sudo instead of gksu or so?
2008-11-24T01:51:00.000Z	hischild	genii	I have not. I can explain what i have done, yet i can't think of anything that might have caused it.
2008-11-24T01:53:00.000Z	hischild	genii	i have also tried to set the proper permissions that i've read so far (home folder ownd by own user, chmod to 644) or remove the file to be recreated with proper permissions. None have been succesful so far.
2008-11-24T01:53:00.000Z	genii	hischild	I would recommend:   sudo chown -Rh yourname:yourname /home/yourname     first, to make all in there belong to proper user
2008-11-24T01:54:00.000Z	hischild	genii	all is owned by my user. This i have checked and double checked, but i'll check again.
2008-11-24T01:54:00.000Z	genii	hischild	Importantly are the .files (normally hidden)
2008-11-24T01:56:00.000Z	hischild	genii	all files are owned by my user, including hidden files and folders.
2008-11-24T01:57:00.000Z	genii	hischild	drwxr-xr-x are default perms for /home/username
2008-11-24T02:00:00.000Z	hischild	genii	you have my thanks. Setting those permissions fixed it.
2008-11-24T02:01:00.000Z	genii	hischild	Glad to help
2008-11-24T02:08:00.000Z	genii	hischild	Thanks for the cookie
2008-11-24T02:08:00.000Z	hischild	genii	you're welcome. I can't type the / straight so i had to send it to you via pm.
