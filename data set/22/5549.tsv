2007-05-30T12:26:00.000Z	Paul_UK		hey all, can someone tell me how i can set the dhcp server to serve from a specific network card (eth1) and not the default, which is eth0.
2007-05-30T12:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Paul_UK	one moment - I did it by altering the init script but there is a more official way
2007-05-30T12:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Paul_UK	just looking - won't take me long, its just not obvious
2007-05-30T12:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Paul_UK	/etc/default/dhcp-server
2007-05-30T12:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Paul_UK	no problem
2007-05-30T12:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Paul_UK	how do you know it doesn't startup
2007-05-30T12:38:00.000Z	Paul_UK	ikonia	because it lists the services when it starts up and says [FAILED]  next to dhcp3
2007-05-30T12:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Paul_UK	check messages
2007-05-30T12:39:00.000Z	Paul_UK	ikonia	yep checked messages, nothing
2007-05-30T12:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Paul_UK	and there is nothing in /var/log/messages
2007-05-30T12:40:00.000Z	Paul_UK	ikonia	no
2007-05-30T12:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Paul_UK	thats quite stange
2007-05-30T12:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Paul_UK	look at the init script and type the start up line manually
2007-05-30T12:42:00.000Z	Paul_UK	ikonia	where is the init script? /etc/init.d/ ?
2007-05-30T12:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Paul_UK	YES
2007-05-30T12:43:00.000Z	Paul_UK	ikonia	lol : dhcpd self-test failed.  Please fix the config file.  The error was  (well its blank)
2007-05-30T12:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Paul_UK	check the config file for something obvious, look at what the self test does
2007-05-30T12:44:00.000Z	Paul_UK	ikonia	shouldnt this be working out of the box?  I mean for a server at least :P
2007-05-30T12:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Paul_UK	no no no no no no
2007-05-30T12:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Paul_UK	you have to configure it
2007-05-30T12:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Paul_UK	fair bit of config
2007-05-30T12:45:00.000Z	Paul_UK	ikonia	oh man well let me use google lol
