2006-11-05T10:22:00.000Z	PinkFloyd		Do I need a DNS server?
2006-11-05T10:22:00.000Z	PinkFloyd		I saw something about DNS server
2006-11-05T10:23:00.000Z	PinkFloyd		So I need to add a DNS server?
2006-11-05T10:23:00.000Z	PinkFloyd		So I need to add a DNS server?
2006-11-05T10:24:00.000Z	PinkFloyd		Ok
2006-11-05T10:24:00.000Z	PinkFloyd		So make sure eth0 is default, again
2006-11-05T10:24:00.000Z	PinkFloyd		So do I add a DNS or will it add by itself?
2006-11-05T10:25:00.000Z	PinkFloyd		Where would I find those?
2006-11-05T10:25:00.000Z	PinkFloyd		In Windows, I just plug in the LAN and go
2006-11-05T10:25:00.000Z	PinkFloyd		It autoconfigures itself
2006-11-05T10:26:00.000Z	Daverocks	PinkFloyd	if everything's automatic on windows then it probably uses DHCP ... you can easily have ubuntu auto-obtain IPs with DHCP too
2006-11-05T10:27:00.000Z	PinkFloyd	Daverocks	I have the eth0 set on DHCP
2006-11-05T10:27:00.000Z	Daverocks	PinkFloyd	and something like "ping 4.2.2.2" doesn't work either?
2006-11-05T10:41:00.000Z	Daverocks	PinkFloyd	?
2006-11-05T10:42:00.000Z	Daverocks	PinkFloyd	"your own IP" as in 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.0.x?
2006-11-05T10:42:00.000Z	Daverocks	PinkFloyd	but it's still a non-loopback IP, yeah
2006-11-05T10:42:00.000Z	PinkFloyd	Daverocks	can I query?
2006-11-05T10:42:00.000Z	Daverocks	PinkFloyd	query what?
2006-11-05T10:43:00.000Z	PinkFloyd	Daverocks	what do I need to do now?
2006-11-05T10:45:00.000Z	PinkFloyd	Daverocks	do you have AIM or anything like that?
2006-11-05T10:46:00.000Z	Daverocks	PinkFloyd	not AIM, but i don't give out my msn publicly, sorry :(
2006-11-05T10:46:00.000Z	Daverocks	PinkFloyd	will IRC PMs do?
