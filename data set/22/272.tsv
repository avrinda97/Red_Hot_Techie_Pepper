2012-05-06T07:44:00.000Z	iananananan		Where on earth did synoptic disappear to, and why can't I find it in 12.04?
2012-05-06T07:45:00.000Z	jrib	iananananan	you can install it if you don't have it
2012-05-06T07:45:00.000Z	iananananan	jrib	are you telling me synoptic's no longer shipping with ubuntu distros?
2012-05-06T07:46:00.000Z	jrib	iananananan	I don't know.  If you don't have it on a default install, then I suppose not.  It would be duplicating functionality provided by ubuntu software center anyway I imagine
2012-05-06T07:47:00.000Z	iananananan	jrib	I suppose the redundancy is a fair point, but I do miss it.
2012-05-06T07:47:00.000Z	jrib	iananananan	sudo apt-get install synaptic :)
2012-05-06T07:48:00.000Z	iananananan	jrib	do you know the terminal command for enabling universe offhand?
2012-05-06T07:48:00.000Z	jrib	iananananan	edit /etc/apt/sources.list in your favorite text editor
2012-05-06T07:55:00.000Z	iananananan	jrib	"package 'synaptic' has no installation candidate"
2012-05-06T07:55:00.000Z	iananananan	jrib	updated sources n everything. also ran apt-get update. no dice.
2012-05-06T07:55:00.000Z	jrib	iananananan	run « sudo apt-get update » after enabling universe in /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-05-06T07:56:00.000Z	iananananan	jrib	probably added incorrect sources.
2012-05-06T07:56:00.000Z	jrib	iananananan	pastebin /etc/apt/sources.list if you want
2012-05-06T07:56:00.000Z	iananananan	jrib	will do. found a dated documentation page, i think it's inaccurate.
2012-05-06T07:59:00.000Z	iananananan	jrib	http://www.pastebin.com/aYJihZhY
2012-05-06T07:59:00.000Z	iananananan	jrib	last two lines were ones i added.
2012-05-06T08:00:00.000Z	jrib	iananananan	that's correct.  Now sudo apt-get update && apt-cache policy synaptic
2012-05-06T08:01:00.000Z	iananananan	jrib	there we go. What was that after the ampersand?
2012-05-06T08:01:00.000Z	jrib	iananananan	apt-cache policy just gives info about a package -- it didn't actually /do/ anything
2012-05-06T08:02:00.000Z	iananananan	jrib	it did actually update the packages as o-
2012-05-06T08:02:00.000Z	iananananan	jrib	I now realize I hadn't been connected to the web. Damn liveCDs.
2012-05-06T08:02:00.000Z	iananananan	jrib	Whoops!
