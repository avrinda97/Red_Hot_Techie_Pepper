2008-09-04T04:29:00.000Z	ASrock		im trying to install vmware and i got a folder with a bunch of other folders and what i believe is the installation file "install.pl" how do i run .pl files?
2008-09-04T04:30:00.000Z	unop	ASrock	where is the .pl file located?
2008-09-04T04:30:00.000Z	unop	ASrock	enter a terminal and do this. cd Desktop/vmware/ && ./install.pl
2008-09-04T04:31:00.000Z	ASrock	unop	ok
2008-09-04T04:33:00.000Z	ASrock	unop	i get this...You may want to re-install the VMware Workstation 6.0.4 build-93057 for Linux
2008-09-04T04:34:00.000Z	unop	ASrock	hmm .. and what are you trying to install now?
2008-09-04T04:34:00.000Z	unop	ASrock	vmware workstation right?
2008-09-04T04:35:00.000Z	unop	ASrock	are you sure you have the full version of vmware workstation - not just an update package?
2008-09-04T04:37:00.000Z	ASrock	unop	ya im almost possotive its the full installation, how would installing the windows version in wine go you think?
2008-09-04T04:38:00.000Z	unop	ASrock	i wouldn't attempt that -- what version of the workstation do you have?
2008-09-04T04:38:00.000Z	ASrock	unop	6.0.4.93057
2008-09-04T04:38:00.000Z	ASrock	unop	for 64 bit
2008-09-04T04:39:00.000Z	unop	ASrock	and you are on a 64bit install right?
2008-09-04T04:39:00.000Z	ASrock	unop	yes
2008-09-04T04:39:00.000Z	unop	ASrock	ok, delete the vmware directory (from the desktop) .. extract the archive again and try running this perl script again.
2008-09-04T04:40:00.000Z	ASrock	unop	well the folder has a "bin" "usr" "etc" "lib" and so on folders, is there some way i can package them into a .deb file so i can use ubuntus package installer?
2008-09-04T04:41:00.000Z	unop	ASrock	errm, there probably is -- but I am not sure how its done, the vmware installer runs quite differently to other installers
2008-09-04T04:42:00.000Z	ASrock	unop	well i just need some way to run Windows XP in a virtual machine i dont really have any preference on what program all i know is virtualbox didnt work right
2008-09-04T04:44:00.000Z	ASrock	unop	it seems to be working now
2008-09-04T04:44:00.000Z	unop	ASrock	nice
2008-09-04T04:45:00.000Z	ASrock	unop	holy crap you wernt kidding when you said vmwares installer was different than most other installers
2008-09-04T05:05:00.000Z	ASrock	unop	thanks for the info on installing vmware, it is installed and now installing windows xp
