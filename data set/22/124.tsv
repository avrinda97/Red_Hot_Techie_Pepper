2012-06-16T19:02:00.000Z	llutz		!info libimobiledevice2 | thedingo   may i ask why you don't use the version from the repo?
2012-06-16T19:03:00.000Z	thedingo	llutz	i tried. it's not working for me. I added the LaunchPad repo (which was a whole thing in and of itself) and when ever I try an apt-get it says it can't find the package
2012-06-16T19:04:00.000Z	llutz	thedingo	it is in main, no launchpad repo needed
2012-06-16T19:04:00.000Z	thedingo		either way. it doesn't work for me
2012-06-16T19:04:00.000Z	llutz	thedingo	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libimobiledevice2
