2009-01-28T22:17:00.000Z	flithm		hey does anyone know if there are packages available for the latest stable nvidia driver (180.22)?  I can only find 180.11 in medibuntu
2009-01-28T22:19:00.000Z	Starhero_	flithm	You need to install the alias packages and then the restricted drivers will appear in the list of "restricted drivers"
2009-01-28T22:19:00.000Z	flithm	Starhero_	restricted drivers is installed but I only get an old version of the nvidia driver (177.xx) from that?
2009-01-28T22:19:00.000Z	Starhero_	flithm	sudo apt-get install nvidia-180-modaliases
2009-01-28T22:20:00.000Z	Starhero_	flithm	then look in the list after that is done
2009-01-28T22:22:00.000Z	Starhero_	flithm	I warn you, I personally am having issuses with the 180.22 drivers. Your milage may very.
2009-01-28T22:23:00.000Z	flithm	Starhero_	I only see 180.11 in the list after the aliases -- and what kind of problems?  should I stick with 180.11?
2009-01-28T22:24:00.000Z	Starhero_	flithm	It isn't seeing any screens, basicly I go into low graphic mode (640x480) and even if I change the rez, I am stuck with no 3d fx.
2009-01-28T22:25:00.000Z	flithm	Starhero_	doh!
2009-01-28T22:25:00.000Z	Starhero_	flithm	This might just be my computer tho, hence is the reason my I am in this channel
2009-01-28T22:25:00.000Z	flithm	Starhero_	what card you have?
2009-01-28T22:25:00.000Z	Starhero_	flithm	7700 GO
2009-01-28T22:26:00.000Z	flithm	Starhero_	are you using jaunty?  how did you get 180.22?
2009-01-28T22:27:00.000Z	Starhero_		Anyone know why installing any nvidia drivers 180.22 and 180.25 will not produce any "screens" or usable "screens" on my computer ( I WANT MY CUBE BACK!)
2009-01-28T22:27:00.000Z	flithm	Starhero_	do you get any xorg log output?
2009-01-28T22:29:00.000Z	Starhero_	flithm	Yes, if  I look at it it says it can't find any screens
2009-01-28T22:29:00.000Z	Starhero_	flithm	or usable screens
2009-01-28T22:29:00.000Z	flithm	Starhero_	how about dmesg output from nvidia modprobing?
2009-01-28T22:29:00.000Z	Starhero_	flithm	checking that one momment
2009-01-28T22:31:00.000Z	Starhero_	flithm	Doesn't seem to be any progblems I greped it for nvidia. but I am currently running the unrestricted drivers so I am not sure if that would change anything (I do assume it would tho)
2009-01-28T22:31:00.000Z	flithm	Starhero_	try shutting down X, rmmod the open source driver, then modprobe nvidia and see if that gives you and dmesg output
2009-01-28T22:32:00.000Z	Starhero_	flithm	will do, bb in a bit if all goes well LOL
