2009-08-16T04:39:00.000Z	haf1z		some1 can tell me what is virtual box? virtual machine?
2009-08-16T04:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	haf1z	it's a virtual machine
2009-08-16T04:39:00.000Z	haf1z	lstarnes	how it works?
2009-08-16T04:39:00.000Z	haf1z	lstarnes	is it the same with wine?
2009-08-16T04:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	haf1z	wine isn't a virtual machine.  It's an emulation of the windows API/ABI
2009-08-16T04:41:00.000Z	haf1z	lstarnes	what is the function vbox?
2009-08-16T04:41:00.000Z	lstarnes	haf1z	virtualbox is a virtual machine
2009-08-16T04:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	haf1z	vbox is another name for virtualbox
2009-08-16T04:42:00.000Z	haf1z	lstarnes	can it be same with dualboot?
2009-08-16T04:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	haf1z	it's different from a dualboot
2009-08-16T04:43:00.000Z	lstarnes	haf1z	a true dualboot doesn't use any emulation and runs directly on the actual hardware
2009-08-16T04:44:00.000Z	haf1z		do you have any advice, since i am new.. is that vm is for advanced user or what?
2009-08-16T04:44:00.000Z	lstarnes	haf1z	maybe more intermediate
2009-08-16T04:44:00.000Z	lstarnes	haf1z	virtualbox is fairly easy to use
2009-08-16T04:46:00.000Z	haf1z	lstarnes	1 more thing, whats is the benefit of using vm?
2009-08-16T04:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	haf1z	things that run in a vm don't have full hardware access and don't need to be installed on a hard disk partition
2009-08-16T04:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	haf1z	plus some virtual machines, like qemu, support other architectures, like mips or sparc
2009-08-16T04:47:00.000Z	haf1z	lstarnes	so, i think its better to use dualboot right?
2009-08-16T04:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	haf1z	it depends on what you need to do
2009-08-16T04:49:00.000Z	haf1z		so guys, let say im running linux on windows. i did write file and save in linux. then i reboot. does the file i save remains?
2009-08-16T04:49:00.000Z	lstarnes	haf1z	it should if you installed ubuntu on a filesystem image or hard disk
