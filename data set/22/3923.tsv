2008-06-13T22:34:00.000Z	John_S		I would like to install the 2.6.24-16 kernel from the command line. Can someone please tell me what command I would use to install the kernel and all the packages associated with that kernel?
2008-06-13T22:35:00.000Z	HardDisk	John_S	sudo apt-cache search 2.6.24-16
2008-06-13T22:34:00.000Z	HardDisk	John_S	why 16?
2008-06-13T22:35:00.000Z	John_S	HardDisk	Well, I'm having problems with the 19 version it seems ("kernel panic"), so I would like to go back to the 16 version.
2008-06-13T22:35:00.000Z	HardDisk	John_S	sudo apt-cache search 2.6.24.16
2008-06-13T22:39:00.000Z	John_S	HardDisk	Thanks, but that returns about 4 screen fulls worth of packages, including debug packages that I assume I don't need. Is there some "apt-get install ..." command for one of those particular packages that will install all the kernel stuff I need? Or do I need to manually install a bunch of packages separately?
2008-06-13T22:40:00.000Z	HardDisk	John_S	depends on your arch and if you need the restricted drivers or not etc.
2008-06-13T23:02:00.000Z	John_S	HardDisk	Do you happen to know the command to list a given package that is installed? e.g. if I want to find out which version of libglib I have installed, what is the command?
2008-06-13T23:02:00.000Z	HardDisk	John_S	--version
2008-06-13T23:04:00.000Z	HardDisk	John_S	oh a library, then you need apt-cache policy nameofpackage
2008-06-13T23:04:00.000Z	HardDisk	John_S	if its a binary, just command --version
2008-06-13T23:06:00.000Z	John_S	HardDisk	But what if I don't know the exact name of the package? Doing "apt-cache policy libglib" does not return anything (I'm pretty sure I have it installed).
2008-06-13T23:06:00.000Z	HardDisk	John_S	tab it
2008-06-13T23:07:00.000Z	HardDisk	John_S	after libglib hit tab <sometimes twice> youll see the list
2008-06-13T23:08:00.000Z	John_S	HardDisk	Hmm... tabbing it doesn't work. Isn't there some way simply search through all my installed package names for a string? ("libglib")
2008-06-13T23:09:00.000Z	HardDisk	John_S	apt-cache search
2008-06-13T23:09:00.000Z	HardDisk	John_S	and it does work, trust me.
2008-06-13T23:10:00.000Z	John_S	HardDisk	I thought that command was to search through available packages, not installed packages--is that not true?
2008-06-13T23:10:00.000Z	HardDisk	John_S	I told you to use policy it does work
2008-06-13T23:11:00.000Z	HardDisk	John_S	apt-cache policy libglib<tab><or_twice> you'll see a list of installed libglib*
2008-06-13T23:11:00.000Z	HardDisk	John_S	choose the one you want and it will tell you the installed version
2008-06-13T23:12:00.000Z	John_S	HardDisk	Yes, thanks, that's exactly what I tried and it doesn't return anything (and also for any other packages I try). I'm in recovery mode in the console--I wouldn't think that would make a difference, but is that my problem with tabbing?
