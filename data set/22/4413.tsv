2008-01-21T01:12:00.000Z	jimmygoon		this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdm/+bug/180881  does anyone know how to fix this :(
2008-01-21T01:14:00.000Z	misslecommander	jimmygoon	yes i had the same issue, it was somehow related to the desktop resolution
2008-01-21T01:14:00.000Z	jimmygoon	misslecommander	in what way? its the right one for my laptop, I've always used this res and I've only had this prob on 7.10
2008-01-21T01:15:00.000Z	misslecommander	jimmygoon	it not only was very ver large, but then i changed desktop resolution, and then it was super super small. wierd
2008-01-21T01:15:00.000Z	misslecommander	jimmygoon	i dont know what fixed it, but now its fine, it had something to do with video settings
2008-01-21T01:15:00.000Z	jimmygoon	misslecommander	hm, well, I just changed from "intel" to the (old) "i810" driver so give me a sec to restart gdm
2008-01-21T01:16:00.000Z	misslecommander	jimmygoon	it may bot be driver specific, it might do the same will all driver. i have nvidai, you have intel, does same thing
2008-01-21T01:16:00.000Z	jimmygoon	misslecommander	alright, well, I've got nothing else to try yet
2008-01-21T01:16:00.000Z	jimmygoon		brb
2008-01-21T01:17:00.000Z	misslecommander	jimmygoon	i tried both drivers as wll, no change, it has something to do with resolution fix. let me get you link

2008-01-21T01:19:00.000Z	jimmygoon	misslecommander	I'm gonna have to file a bug against the "intel" driver I guess... or do some more research
2008-01-21T01:19:00.000Z	jimmygoon	misslecommander	yep, that was the only thing i did was change from intel -> i810
