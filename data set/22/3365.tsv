2008-09-26T04:51:00.000Z	Fat		O.K. Starting over...  I wish to rename a heop-o-files with the existing filename structure of {A}{Space}{Hyphen}{Space}{B}.{Ext}.  I would like to end up with {B} {Space}{Hyphen}{Space}{A}.{Ext}  I could possible remove the .{Ext} from the originals before renaming and then re-add after if this would make the procedure easier.  The content represented by {A} and {B} is alpha numeric pluse additi0onal characters invluding
2008-09-26T04:51:00.000Z	Fat		 spaces.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
2008-09-26T04:51:00.000Z	jrib	Fat	use rename, see 'man rename'.  Feel free to poke if you are stuck
2008-09-26T04:59:00.000Z	jrib	Fat	rename -n 's/(.*) - (.*)\.(.*)/$2 - $1.$3/' *                 remove the -n if you are satisfied with what it says it will do
2008-09-26T04:59:00.000Z	jrib	Fat	I put extensions in there
2008-09-26T05:25:00.000Z	Fat	jrib	 Back already...  I typed in    rename 'jb/Desktop/123./(.*) - (.*) \.(.*)/$2 - $1.$3/' *   and following resulted   Backslash found where operator expected at (eval 1) line 1, near "*) \"   (Missing operator before  \?)   syntax error at (eval 1) line 1, near "(."   Any thoughts?
2008-09-26T05:25:00.000Z	jrib	Fat	why is there a path in the quotes?
2008-09-26T05:27:00.000Z	jrib	Fat	you need to just 'cd' to where the files are and keep the stuff inside the quotes how it was (with the s/blah/bleh/.  The 's' needs to be there)
2008-09-26T05:27:00.000Z	Fat	jrib	Well, being a true noob, I figured it would have to know where the file were that it hand to act on!  (Alright, keep the snickering down!)
2008-09-26T05:27:00.000Z	jrib	Fat	and use '-n' so that it won't actually do anything but just tell you what it would do
2008-09-26T05:29:00.000Z	Fat	jrib	 OK, here goes.....(Me thinks me follows what your up to!)
2008-09-26T05:35:00.000Z	Fat	jrib	 Once again getting skewered by the finger of fate!  When I try   cd jb/Desktop/123   I get   bash: cd: jb/Desktop/123: No such file or directory  Now, that'a a lie 'cause I see it! Not only that I made it!  Again, any thoughts?
2008-09-26T05:36:00.000Z	jrib	Fat	just do: cd ~/Desktop/123
2008-09-26T05:37:00.000Z	Fat	jrib	Scunizi   Thanks, here we go again, stay tuned....
2008-09-26T05:38:00.000Z	Fat	jrib	 Scunizi:  BINGO - we got the directory, now, onward...
2008-09-26T05:44:00.000Z	Fat	jrib	 Scunizi:  Here's what went in,   jb@jb-desktop:~/Desktop/123$ rename -n 's./(.*) - (.*)\.(.*)/$2 - $1.$3/' *   And here's what came out   Unmatched ( in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m//( <-- HERE / at (eval 1) line 1.  I get the feeling we're getting closer....but there again....
2008-09-26T05:45:00.000Z	jrib	Fat	no . after the s
2008-09-26T05:45:00.000Z	Fat	jrib	 OK, back shortly
2008-09-26T05:51:00.000Z	Fat	jrib	It Happened!!!!  Many thanks,  file names revised perfectly.  Greatly appreciate your help.  Now one last question.  I was working with a sample 10 if the many I have to do.  In future I will remove the "-n" n'est pas?
2008-09-26T05:52:00.000Z	jrib	Fat	-n means the command doesn't actually rename anything.  It just outputs what it would do
2008-09-26T05:57:00.000Z	Fat	jrib	 Ah yes, on checking the test directory I see what you mean.  I'll remove the "-n" and give it another run although methinks there'll be no problems now.
2008-10-04T01:43:00.000Z	Fat	jrib	are you available??
