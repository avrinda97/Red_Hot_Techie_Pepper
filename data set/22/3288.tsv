2008-10-21T14:52:00.000Z	Ohmu_	roxan	have done. And other machiens can see my box.  but they cant eg ping google.com or fetch a webpage. and the ips look fishy.  169.254.blah iirc
2008-10-21T14:53:00.000Z	roxan	Ohmu_	you need to seup ip manually or use dhcp server in ur system
2008-10-21T14:54:00.000Z	Ohmu_	roxan	which ip do you mean?  The ip for each machine that will use the network?
2008-10-21T14:56:00.000Z	roxan	Ohmu_	you need to use some private ips
2008-10-21T14:57:00.000Z	Ohmu_	roxan	theres 2 housemates.  So my ubuntu box needs to create 2 private ips?  How to do this?
2008-10-21T15:00:00.000Z	roxan	Ohmu_	i think you need to read some tutorial. its little complicated if you dont know the basics

2008-10-21T15:03:00.000Z	Ohmu_	roxan	I was hoping to use dhcp on ubuntu box, so I wouldn't need to worry about that.

2008-10-21T15:08:00.000Z	Ohmu_	roxan	thanks! reading...
2008-10-21T15:31:00.000Z	Ohmu_	roxan	from that page I learned that I have to install dhcp3-server (which I did), and edit the /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.con file, (which I have - with the example text on the page).  Now I've run sudo dhcpd3, and it says it's not configured to listen on any interfaces.  What does this mean?  What's an interface?
2008-10-21T15:32:00.000Z	roxan	Ohmu_	try the name of your wireless interface
2008-10-21T15:33:00.000Z	Ohmu_	roxan	as a param?  sudo dhcpd3 wlan0?  I have wlan0 and wifi0 ... duno why I have 2
2008-10-21T15:36:00.000Z	Ohmu_	roxan	gtg thanks for the help
2008-10-21T15:36:00.000Z	roxan	Ohmu_	ok
