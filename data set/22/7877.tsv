2005-12-07T13:44:00.000Z	Fujitsu	reign	What is the issue?
2005-12-07T13:44:00.000Z	Fujitsu	reign	I noticed that.
2005-12-07T13:46:00.000Z	Fujitsu	reign	it apparently doesn't know it is a NIC... Maybe you need to load some kernel module...
2005-12-07T13:46:00.000Z	Fujitsu	reign	First, we need to find out what the module for your card is.
2005-12-07T13:48:00.000Z	reign	Fujitsu	ok let me see if i can find one, ill let you know when i have one
2005-12-07T13:56:00.000Z	reign	Fujitsu	the tulip driver was removed
2005-12-07T14:06:00.000Z	reign	Fujitsu	apparently the tulip driver is in the kernel source that i downloaded
2005-12-07T14:07:00.000Z	reign	Fujitsu	by telling you that... it means i dont know what to do next :P
2005-12-07T14:08:00.000Z	reign	Fujitsu	i dont know
2005-12-07T14:09:00.000Z	Fujitsu	reign	sudo modprobe tulip in a terminal.
2005-12-07T14:10:00.000Z	Fujitsu	reign	check the details for the card again...
2005-12-07T14:11:00.000Z	reign	Fujitsu	looks the same
2005-12-07T14:12:00.000Z	Fujitsu	reign	odd. I don't know anything about these linksys cards.
2005-12-07T14:15:00.000Z	reign	Fujitsu	the reason im using this card, is because my realtek card wasnt being detected either
2005-12-07T14:35:00.000Z	reign	Fujitsu	do you know more about the RTL8139 cards ?
2005-12-07T14:35:00.000Z	Fujitsu	reign	yes.
2005-12-07T14:36:00.000Z	Fujitsu	reign	RTL8139s are what I use.
2005-12-07T14:54:00.000Z	Fujitsu	reign	yes. There must be a driver for it _somewhere_...
2005-12-07T14:55:00.000Z	reign	Fujitsu	i know it's supposed to
2005-12-07T15:36:00.000Z	Fujitsu	reign	how ar you going?
