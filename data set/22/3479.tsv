2008-08-22T07:31:00.000Z	pcfreak30		k.
2008-08-22T07:31:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	this is during the installation. it's already started detecting hardware, and it is running from the CD yet telling me it can't detect any common CD-ROM drives (the only one it has is the one it's running from)
2008-08-22T07:32:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	I dunno anything at all about slackware so that doesn't help me
2008-08-22T07:33:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	will it cause a problem if I install it like this, or should I keep trying until it sees it?
2008-08-22T07:34:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	no need to shut it down... it's not liveCD
2008-08-22T07:36:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	yeah it's an old emachine lol
2008-08-22T07:38:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	who are you talking to? helps if you put the name before what you're saying
2008-08-22T07:45:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	That's why it's a good idea to put a name in front of what you're saying so people know who you are talking to (like i did)
2008-08-22T07:52:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	same issue. it won't detect the CD-ROM even tho it's booted from it. claims it may not be IDE or SCSI but it is an IDE Atapi CD-ROM
2008-08-22T07:53:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	I'm only going to try so many times before I threow it out the window
2008-08-22T07:54:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	my previous installation of kubuntu 6.06 LTS had absolutely no problems with the CD drive
2008-08-22T07:54:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	why? it's an IDE device
2008-08-22T07:54:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	it is a standard cd-rom drive double speed
2008-08-22T07:58:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	could it be the fact that my BIOS sees it as an ATAPI CDROM device?
2008-08-22T07:58:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	they are.
2008-08-22T07:59:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	now why would that make a difference? it boots from it
2008-08-22T08:00:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	maybe I should just try telling ubuntu it is /dev/cdrom?
2008-08-22T08:02:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	no it's not a hard drive. it is a CD-ROM drive
2008-08-22T08:04:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	no and even if I could, it doesn't matter cuz I don't have one anyway
2008-08-22T08:06:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	I'm running an alternate CD with no LiveCD
2008-08-22T08:16:00.000Z	Whiz_2	pcfreak30	looks like my problem is a common one with this latest release of ubuntu! https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cdrom-detect/+bug/195614
