2009-06-23T17:54:00.000Z	neongrau		i have a sendmail setup from an gentoo server i want to migrate to ubuntu server. i already have 2 proper .mc files to generate 2 sendmail.cf's but i can't seem to figure out how to integrate them with the ubuntu startscripts or its /etc/mail/sendmail.conf :(
2009-06-23T17:55:00.000Z	mdm	neongrau	m4
2009-06-23T17:56:00.000Z	mdm	neongrau	mc files are a script for the processor m4, you need to convert them to .cf files.  and you do this with the command m4
2009-06-23T17:56:00.000Z	neongrau	mdm	i know, i already got them, my prob is the init.d script of ubuntu
2009-06-23T17:58:00.000Z	mdm	neongrau	what is the problem you have with the init script?
2009-06-23T18:01:00.000Z	mdm	neongrau	do you mean its starting an MTA and a MSA?  that is your conf file, one recives email the other sends it
2009-06-23T18:02:00.000Z	neongrau	mdm	yep thats whats it's probably doing. but it's not starting the 2nd process the way i want (with -C/etc/mail/sendmail-rx.cf) as extra options
2009-06-23T18:03:00.000Z	mdm	neongrau	its supposed to do that.  the process that you think of, sendmail is on half of the smtp archtecture.  When your email client sends mail (when you do) you connect to one part, it then tells the other part to pass that mail on.  Its suposed to be like that, its part of the architecture, its part of security, and its supposed to be like that
2009-06-23T18:04:00.000Z	mdm	neongrau	that isnt a ubuntu thing btw its a smtp and sendmail thing
2009-06-23T18:05:00.000Z	neongrau	mdm	have a look -> http://pastie.org/521539
2009-06-23T18:06:00.000Z	mdm	neongrau	what about it?
2009-06-23T18:07:00.000Z	mdm	neongrau	do you mean you want to have the init script use those? change them to sendmail.cf and submit.cf
2009-06-23T18:07:00.000Z	neongrau	mdm	exactly, the config part of sendmail is perfectly fine. just the starting/stoppting via the init script is my prob
2009-06-23T18:08:00.000Z	mdm	neongrau	either rename sendmail-rx.cf to submit.cf or change the init script
2009-06-23T18:08:00.000Z	mdm	neongrau	as for the queue options you have to change those as well, altho the only thing I notice that inst normal is the log level
2009-06-23T18:11:00.000Z	neongrau	mdm	s.th. different. any idea why "killall -9 sendmail" doesnt work on ubuntu?
2009-06-23T18:12:00.000Z	mdm	neongrau	killall means kill with process signal 9 (SIGKILL) all processes named sendmail.  Not processes named sendmail.real, sendma or anything EXCEPT sendmail
2009-06-23T18:12:00.000Z	mdm	neongrau	killall is baiscly a sledge hammer of last resort. And surely not a nice way to hand processes
2009-06-23T18:13:00.000Z	neongrau	mdm	so when i have "root      6674  0.0  0.8   8848  2060 ?        Ss   09:12   0:00 sendmail: accepting connections"
2009-06-23T18:17:00.000Z	mdm	neongrau	use /etc/init.d/sendmail stop to stop sendmail
2009-06-23T18:21:00.000Z	neongrau	mdm	"killall -9 sendmail-mta" did indeed work, would've been nice to see the correct processname in ps :S
2009-06-23T18:23:00.000Z	mdm	neongrau	dont use it, it would be a good way to loose email
