2008-08-03T11:45:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8		﻿jb_in_nyc: you set it up just like your router is setup. changing things can make it so you wont connect
2008-08-03T11:45:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8		﻿jb_in_nyc:  do you know what WPA and WEP do ?
2008-08-03T11:45:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8		﻿jb_in_nyc:  then prob best off not messing with them
2008-08-03T11:46:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8		﻿jb_in_nyc:  have your friend come over and help you out with it, the one that originally installed Ubuntu
2008-08-03T11:46:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8		﻿jb_in_nyc:  oh so youre not on wifi, youre on LAN ?
2008-08-03T11:47:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8		﻿jb_in_nyc: do you have access to your laptop ? i mean if your not using it for IRC then you can prob work on it without much loss of functionality
