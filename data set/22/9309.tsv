2004-12-31T09:17:00.000Z	rjek	anir	I think you'll find Windows will work best for those.  Considering they're written for Windows.
2004-12-31T09:36:00.000Z	rjek	anir	What information doesn't the FAQ give you that you need?
2004-12-31T09:39:00.000Z	rjek	anir	In a terminal window, type "sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.8-mad"
2004-12-31T09:40:00.000Z	anir	rjek	how will i open a terminal window?
2004-12-31T09:40:00.000Z	rjek	anir	Right click on the desktop, and click on "Open Terminal"
2004-12-31T09:44:00.000Z	rjek	anir	You're likely to be mistyping it, then.
2004-12-31T09:47:00.000Z	anir	rjek	i typed the password wrong now nothing is taking ..what do i do?
2004-12-31T09:48:00.000Z	rjek	anir	Give up? :)
2004-12-31T09:49:00.000Z	rjek	anir	OK.  Close that terminal window you opened.  Open a new one.  Do "apt-get install gstreamer0.8-mad" again, but type your password in right this time.
2004-12-31T09:54:00.000Z	anir	rjek	its giving  couldnot get lock/var/lib/dpkg/lock
2004-12-31T09:54:00.000Z	rjek	anir	That's because you're missing the "sudo" bit.
2004-12-31T10:03:00.000Z	anir	rjek	u there?
2004-12-31T10:03:00.000Z	anir	rjek	i typed and it says that its already installed

2004-12-31T10:03:00.000Z	rjek	anir	There you go, then.
2004-12-31T10:05:00.000Z	rjek	anir	What does it say when you try to do "apt-get install xmms" ?
2004-12-31T10:06:00.000Z	anir	rjek	do i have to install gxmms too??
2004-12-31T10:06:00.000Z	rjek	anir	No.
2004-12-31T10:08:00.000Z	rjek	anir	Which ever ones you like.
2004-12-31T10:13:00.000Z	rjek	anir	There are some native Linux ports of games.  Like Doom 3 and Return To Castle Wolfenstien.  There are plenty of "free" games too, but none are especially graphically stunning.
