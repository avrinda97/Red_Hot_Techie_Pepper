2005-02-27T17:00:00.000Z	howrealisreal		okay. thanks anyway
2005-02-27T17:00:00.000Z	howrealisreal		i have to remake the kernel?
2005-02-27T17:00:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	since it's being loaded somewhere, it should be listed in some config file, and all config files are in /etc.  So, fgrep -r floppy /etc will help...
2005-02-27T17:01:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	does it sound logical? ;)
2005-02-27T17:10:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	are you sure? say, /etc/modules?
2005-02-27T17:13:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	nope ;)  Well i give up ;)
2005-02-27T17:14:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	it must be somewhere, and 99% chances it's in /etc.  If not, well...  maybe it's finding some plug-n-play stuff in your bios and tries to load that module in a hope there is a floppy drive...
2005-02-27T17:15:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	when it's loading, can you say? I mean, in initrd or after it?
2005-02-27T17:17:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	so my second quess was right when -- it's the hotplug startup scripts that handles all that stuff.  In a hurry, you can list "floppy" (in a line by itself, w/o quotes) in /etc/hotplug/blacklist, or maybe better create a file with single line "floppy" in /etc/hotplug.d/
2005-02-27T17:18:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	it may be interesting to find out why it is trying to load the module in the first place, but that's some more digging.. ;)
2005-02-27T17:18:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	yes
2005-02-27T17:18:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	/etc/hotplug/blacklist.d/nofloppy is the most appropriate ;)
2005-02-27T17:21:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	yes -- w/o quotes ofcourse
2005-02-27T17:21:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	you can verify w/o rebooting
2005-02-27T17:21:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	/etc/init.d/hotplug start
2005-02-27T17:34:00.000Z	howrealisreal	mjt	no dice.. it still gets an error
2005-02-27T17:35:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	remember my comment - "and try hotplug start without that file you created too" ? ;)
2005-02-27T17:36:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	it might not be hotplug, after all ;)
2005-02-27T17:37:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	when starting hotplug or when starting something else?
2005-02-27T17:44:00.000Z	howrealisreal	mjt	you have any other ideas of how to prevent hotplug from trying to install the floppy drie?
2005-02-27T17:45:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	well, if it's really hotplug... it should honor your hotplug/blacklist stuff.  You can try to debug it (setting VERBOSE=yes in /etc/default/hotplug).  Or, you can disable it entirely the "hard way", by creating a file /etc/modprobe.d/hofloppy with a line "install floppy :" (again w/o quotes)
2005-02-27T17:47:00.000Z	mjt	howrealisreal	what did you do with hotplug.d ?  We were talking about hotplug/blacklist.d , not about hotplug.d ;)
