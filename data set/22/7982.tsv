2006-07-29T05:55:00.000Z	EpP		does anyone use WPA with a airport on a mac
2006-07-29T05:55:00.000Z	Seveas	EpP	airport or airport extreme?
2006-07-29T05:55:00.000Z	EpP	Seveas	Airport
2006-07-29T05:56:00.000Z	EpP	Seveas	do u need to use WPA_Supplicant
2006-07-29T05:56:00.000Z	Seveas	EpP	yes, but network-manager makes using that easy
2006-07-29T05:57:00.000Z	EpP	Seveas	how do i get that?
2006-07-29T05:57:00.000Z	Seveas	EpP	a wired connection would be useful for now, then you can run apt-get install network-manager-gnome
2006-07-29T05:59:00.000Z	EpP	Seveas	k i installed it and i tried to run NetworkManger
2006-07-29T06:00:00.000Z	Seveas	EpP	you need to logout + login for it to work
2006-07-30T15:39:00.000Z	EpP	Seveas	u there?
2006-07-30T15:39:00.000Z	Seveas	EpP	yes
2006-07-30T15:40:00.000Z	EpP	Seveas	I have an airport original that i need to connect to WPA and i have NetowrkManager installed. But it shows no WPA
2006-07-30T15:41:00.000Z	Seveas	EpP	then ask someone else -- i'm not working on support right now, sorry
2006-07-31T16:01:00.000Z	EpP	Seveas	Sorry i had to tend to my pet. I never got what you said.
2006-08-05T15:17:00.000Z	Seveas	EpP	depends on whether it's airport or airport extreme
2006-08-05T15:18:00.000Z	EpP	Seveas	its airport 802.11b so its airport original
2006-08-05T15:22:00.000Z	EpP	Seveas	its airport 802.11b so its airport original
2006-08-05T15:22:00.000Z	Seveas	EpP	check lspci -- i though it was prism but am not sure
2006-08-05T15:28:00.000Z	EpP	Seveas	For kismet the driver is prism2_openbsd. Would this be correct?
2006-08-05T15:29:00.000Z	EpP	Seveas	For kismet the driver is prism2_openbsd. Would this be correct?
2006-08-05T15:31:00.000Z	Seveas	EpP	I don't think so... that appears to be for openbsd, not linux
2006-08-05T15:31:00.000Z	EpP	Seveas	so no support for my airport card in kismet?
