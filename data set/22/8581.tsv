2006-05-28T14:41:00.000Z	helpneeded		any advise on ????
2006-05-28T14:41:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	at what point does it hang?

2006-05-28T14:42:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	at what point does it hang?
2006-05-28T14:43:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	uhm. what is it doing at that time?
2006-05-28T14:44:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	what software? does it stop at the same place?
2006-05-28T14:45:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	that's useless. sorry :|
2006-05-28T14:46:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	Maybe you can get more verbose info somehow. I'm not into the details personally though
2006-05-28T14:46:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	your description is ok
2006-05-28T14:47:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	but only having the information that it hangs at about 50% with a progress bar is useless :)
2006-05-28T14:48:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	but the text install is more verbose, telling you what it's doing, isn't it?
2006-05-28T14:50:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	any of them. just figure what it is trying to install when it hangs
2006-05-28T14:50:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	and if it is the same thing the second time you try
2006-05-28T14:51:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	afaik there is only a linux installer for ubuntu
2006-05-28T14:52:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	I told you already
2006-05-28T14:52:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	it doesn't matter. just figure out what it is trying to instal when it hangs
2006-05-28T14:53:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	I haven't used the gui. sorry :|
2006-05-28T14:54:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	it sounds like it sucks if it doesn't even show what it is installing when it does it
2006-05-28T14:55:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	isn't there an obvious option to get more verbose info during installation?
2006-05-28T14:55:00.000Z	mwe	helpneeded	that sucks. I'm tempted to file a bug report
