2010-09-06T00:22:00.000Z	Deevz		alright this is not working
2010-09-06T00:23:00.000Z	Deevz		is there an option when installing ubuntu to do it without removing files in /home/{user}?
2010-09-06T00:24:00.000Z	Deevz		yes
2010-09-06T00:24:00.000Z	Deevz		im kind of stuck right now
2010-09-06T00:24:00.000Z	Deevz		I upgraded my windows from vista to 7 so I put my important files on the ubuntu partition
2010-09-06T00:25:00.000Z	Deevz		but windows wont let me access the ubuntu part, even with special tools, and grub stopped working so only 7 boots
2010-09-06T00:26:00.000Z	Deevz		i just read that, ubottu, didnt find anything that works for me
2010-09-06T00:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Deevz	what's the error when you boot ?
2010-09-06T00:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Deevz	so how do you boot windows ?
2010-09-06T00:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Deevz	you need to re-install grub2 following that guide that ubottu gave you
2010-09-06T00:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Deevz	you've installed it pointing at the wrong partition, or your ubuntu partition/data is gone
2010-09-06T00:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Deevz	why can't you read it ?
2010-09-06T00:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Deevz	what's stopping you
2010-09-06T00:29:00.000Z	Deevz	ikonia	because it is encrypted I guess
2010-09-06T00:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Deevz	how can you "see it" but not "read it"
2010-09-06T00:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Deevz	what do you mean you guess, either you encypted it, or you didn't
2010-09-06T00:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Deevz	right, so why do you think it's encypted
2010-09-06T00:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Deevz	don't make stuff up
2010-09-06T00:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Deevz	how are ou mounting it ?
2010-09-06T00:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Deevz	then that's why you can't access your disk
2010-09-06T00:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Deevz	you need to mount the disk to be able to access it
2010-09-06T00:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Deevz	ok, you need to mount it
