2010-08-28T22:21:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	flixil	do you have CCSM installed?
2010-08-28T22:22:00.000Z	flixil	WinstonSmith	no, but I can install it in a fly
2010-08-28T22:22:00.000Z	flixil	WinstonSmith	do you mean simple-ccsm?
2010-08-28T22:23:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	flixil	ok because under placw windows>fixed window placement you can configure rules where windows appear
2010-08-28T22:23:00.000Z	WinstonSmith		no the full one
2010-08-28T22:25:00.000Z	flixil	WinstonSmith	i don't find any other package looking for ccsm but simple-ccsm creates a ccsm binary, maybe this is it
2010-08-28T22:26:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	flixil	have a look here : http://imagebin.org/111780 and the package is : compizconfig-settings-manager
2010-08-28T22:26:00.000Z	flixil	WinstonSmith	yes, this package is a dependency of simple-ccsm
2010-08-28T22:27:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	flixil	yes but it is the full settings manager
2010-08-28T22:30:00.000Z	flixil	WinstonSmith	ok, fixed window placement found I'm gonna take a look
2010-08-28T22:30:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	flixil	have a look here : http://imagebin.org/111780
2010-08-28T22:31:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	flixil	ther you can configure the desktop monitor etc where windows should be placed
2010-08-28T22:32:00.000Z	flixil	WinstonSmith	I don't think this is what I need. The thing is for instance, clicking on the sound applet of the toolbar and then on sound preferences (this opens gnome-sound-preferences) it always opens it in the first screen. Doing it from a console from a second screen opens it in the second screen. I wanna know why this DISPLAY variable is not kept
2010-08-28T22:32:00.000Z	flixil		I don't wanna have all the system configuration applications in the second monitor now, I want them where I open them
2010-08-28T22:32:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	flixil	so you want to open them always on the 1st monitor for example?
2010-08-28T22:33:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	flixil	ok cant help you there
2010-08-28T22:33:00.000Z	flixil		no, I want to open them in the active output device, but it doesn't seem to work for applications that are of system configuration or the dialogs that ask for a password. Thanks anyway :)
2010-08-28T22:33:00.000Z	WinstonSmith		np
2010-08-28T22:36:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	flixil	you could play around with place windows>general>placement mode or multi output mode. you have a mode there : use output device with pointer
2010-08-28T22:37:00.000Z	flixil	WinstonSmith	yes, I'm playing with that right now. Thanks
2010-08-28T22:40:00.000Z	flixil	WinstonSmith	doesn't work. it may be a real bug
2010-08-28T22:44:00.000Z	flixil	WinstonSmith	Thanks anyway
