2009-02-12T19:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	runpain2	it will check the system for errors, if you drop to recovery mode root console, you can umount partitions and check them with and options you want
2009-02-12T19:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	runpain2	not sure but if you drop to the console you can run fsck with any options you choose
