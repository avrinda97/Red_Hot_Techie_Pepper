2010-02-04T18:47:00.000Z	DexterLB		hmm internet connection dropped
2010-02-04T18:47:00.000Z	DexterLB		so I'll repeat the question
2010-02-04T18:47:00.000Z	DexterLB		I have a server that is only CLI, and has no soundcerd. Can I install pulseaudio there and make devices discoverable on other computers?
2010-02-04T18:48:00.000Z	Slart	DexterLB	I can't see a reason why you shouldn't be able to run pulseaudio on a computer without a sound card.. not really sure what you mean by "discoverable" though.. you can play audio on another computer using pulseaudio if that's what you mean
2010-02-04T18:48:00.000Z	DexterLB	Slart	yes, that's what I mean
2010-02-04T18:49:00.000Z	Slart	DexterLB	afaik that's one of the major features of pulseaudio.. that is's network transparent
2010-02-04T18:49:00.000Z	DexterLB	Slart	but I have no experience with pulseaudio's config files, I've only used the GUI's, so I'm a n00b there
2010-02-04T18:49:00.000Z	DexterLB	Slart	could you link to a tutorial or something?
2010-02-04T18:49:00.000Z	Slart	DexterLB	there is a pulseaudio manager.. "paman". Try using that
2010-02-04T18:49:00.000Z	DexterLB		oh ok
2010-02-04T18:50:00.000Z	Slart	DexterLB	I've never configured pulseaudio using config files directly
2010-02-04T18:50:00.000Z	Slart		!ops | BettyFord-failed
2010-02-04T18:50:00.000Z	DexterLB	Slart	paman is gui :(
2010-02-04T18:50:00.000Z	DexterLB	Slart	i've got a cli-only system
2010-02-04T18:51:00.000Z	DexterLB	Slart	no X, no videocard, no VNC
2010-02-04T18:51:00.000Z	Slart	DexterLB	yes.. ahhh.. sorry.. you were running server.. sorry.. forgot that
2010-02-04T18:51:00.000Z	Slart	DexterLB	hang.. let me see what I can find
2010-02-04T18:52:00.000Z	DexterLB		well I'm not using ubuntu server
2010-02-04T18:52:00.000Z	DexterLB		I'm using regular ubuntu
2010-02-04T18:52:00.000Z	DexterLB		but with gui removed
2010-02-04T18:54:00.000Z	Slart	DexterLB	couldn't really find anything useful about running pulseaudio without X.. launchpad seems to be offline at the moment
2010-02-04T18:57:00.000Z	Slart	DexterLB	this might be useful http://pulseaudio.org/wiki/CLI
