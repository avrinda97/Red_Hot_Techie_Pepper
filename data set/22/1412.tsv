2010-05-23T07:40:00.000Z	compaq		debian is way older than Ubuntu, debian uses the oldest packages out of all distros out there
2010-05-23T07:42:00.000Z	compaq		I went and bought another agp, and put it in, and installed proprietary nvidia drivers.  It was horrible, my case was left open, cause it is small form factor, and use the card didn't fit with the case on, and on top of that, my cpu was running so high all the time
2010-05-23T07:43:00.000Z	compaq		Then I remembered that long time ago, when I was running debian on this computer, I ran compiz, so I tried again, and sure enough, it installed and so far it running goood
2010-05-23T07:43:00.000Z	compaq		It runs, but it crashes sometimes, so Ubuntu blacklisted it.  But it seems ok so far for me.  We'll see
2010-05-23T07:44:00.000Z	compaq		There is something fishy about nvidia proprietary drivers, they kill cpu
2010-05-23T07:45:00.000Z	Johnny_101	compaq	: Nvidia works fine for me..nothing fishy.
2010-05-23T07:48:00.000Z	Johnny_101	compaq	: Nvidia 3rd Card?
2010-05-23T07:48:00.000Z	compaq	Johnny_101	yep
2010-05-23T07:48:00.000Z	Johnny_101	compaq	: model ?
2010-05-23T07:48:00.000Z	compaq	Johnny_101	its an old one, gforce I think, 128mb
2010-05-23T07:49:00.000Z	compaq	Johnny_101	it doesn't say on the card, but when I had it in, I think that was the driver
2010-05-23T07:49:00.000Z	Johnny_101	compaq	: I use Geforce 7200
2010-05-23T07:49:00.000Z	Johnny_101	compaq	: I use Geforce 7200 256mb
2010-05-23T07:51:00.000Z	compaq	Johnny_101	hmm, so what do you think about my issue of cpu over use.  It was constanly loaded, and now its stays under a quarter, before it was always at 3 quarter(75%)
2010-05-23T07:51:00.000Z	compaq	Johnny_101	and 3d is on now too
2010-05-23T07:52:00.000Z	Johnny_101	compaq	: Ubuntu 10.04 ?
2010-05-23T07:52:00.000Z	compaq	Johnny_101	no, I had to switch for the video driver
2010-05-23T07:53:00.000Z	compaq	Johnny_101	debian 5
2010-05-23T07:53:00.000Z	Johnny_101	compaq	: Why don't you try Debian Channel : There they will be more familiar with this problem.
2010-05-23T07:54:00.000Z	compaq	Johnny_101	I don't have a problem, I was just chit chatting
2010-05-23T07:56:00.000Z	Johnny_101	compaq	: I haven't use Debian ; how does it compare with Ubuntu
2010-05-23T07:57:00.000Z	compaq	Johnny_101	well, on my laptop, I could get power management(sleep and hibernate) working, but it worked out of the box with ubuntu, but on my desktop, it was the reverse, i can't sleep with ubuntu, but it works with debian
