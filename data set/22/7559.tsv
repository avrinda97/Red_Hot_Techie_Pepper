2006-03-22T11:00:00.000Z	intelikey		on mod
2006-03-22T11:00:00.000Z	intelikey		read own
2006-03-22T11:02:00.000Z	YukiCuss	intelikey	that's unsafe.
2006-03-22T11:03:00.000Z	intelikey	YukiCuss	i think no.   it's a lot safer than a number is.
2006-03-22T11:03:00.000Z	YukiCuss	intelikey	no, it should be `u+w' or `o-w'.
2006-03-22T11:04:00.000Z	intelikey	YukiCuss	-rxw grants what ?
2006-03-22T11:04:00.000Z	YukiCuss	intelikey	denies acecss to read/execute/write to everyone.
2006-03-22T11:04:00.000Z	YukiCuss	intelikey	what's your point? Doing `chmod -R +w /home/michael' would make *everything* in his home world writable.
2006-03-22T11:06:00.000Z	intelikey	YukiCuss	you are right,  i don't play with letters in chmod much  only numbers.       thought single entry affected like single number.... my bad.
2006-03-22T11:06:00.000Z	YukiCuss	intelikey	aah, no. the numbers are actually quite easy to understand :)
2006-03-22T11:07:00.000Z	YukiCuss	intelikey	*oh*.
2006-03-22T11:07:00.000Z	YukiCuss	intelikey	I read that backwards. >< my bad.
2006-03-25T08:12:00.000Z	YukiCuss	intelikey	you've asked a few times, no one's answered. Maybe no one on right now knows the answer, maybe just no one feels like speaking up. Try google.
2006-03-25T08:14:00.000Z	intelikey	YukiCuss	there should be someone in here that knows enough about  .Xresources  to answer that question,   if they ever read it....       lol with scrolls like that tho.....
2006-03-25T16:46:00.000Z	intelikey	YukiCuss	errr for updates ?
2006-03-28T17:00:00.000Z	YukiCuss	intelikey	your most recent message is confusing.
2006-03-28T17:01:00.000Z	intelikey	YukiCuss	all my messages are
2006-03-28T17:01:00.000Z	YukiCuss	intelikey	in theory, but I'm just wondering about your comments on `C code.'
2006-03-28T17:02:00.000Z	intelikey	YukiCuss	it's a trade mark.
2006-04-19T10:44:00.000Z	YukiCuss	intelikey	not at all.
2006-04-19T10:49:00.000Z	YukiCuss	intelikey	dankeschon (thank you); bitteschon (you're welcome). possibly with added umlaut.
