2008-07-02T01:09:00.000Z	lenix_		I'm getting really bad speeds transferring files over LAN ? It's much faster in XP for example.. anybody knows a way to fix it / troubleshoot it ?
2008-07-02T01:10:00.000Z	fprefect	lenix_	intel e1000 network card?
2008-07-02T01:10:00.000Z	lenix_	fprefect	nope, i think it's a realtek chipset
2008-07-02T01:10:00.000Z	fprefect	lenix_	are you sure? can you paste the mac-address or do a lsmod?
2008-07-02T01:11:00.000Z	fprefect	lenix_	yes
2008-07-02T01:12:00.000Z	fprefect	lenix_	or do lspci
2008-07-02T01:12:00.000Z	fprefect	lenix_	or something else to test, which network card it is =)

2008-07-02T01:12:00.000Z	fprefect	lenix_	i had a similar problem with a thinkpad t60 laptop, but that one has a e1000 card, and i know the fix for that
2008-07-02T01:12:00.000Z	lenix_	fprefect	 seems like its surecom
2008-07-02T01:13:00.000Z	fprefect	lenix_	right, never heard of that. sorry =)
2008-07-02T01:13:00.000Z	lenix_	fprefect	 could the fix for that e1000 card maybe fix my problem ? or they're not related?
2008-07-02T01:14:00.000Z	fprefect	lenix_	i'm almost sure they're not related, the problem lies within the e1000 kernel module
2008-07-02T01:14:00.000Z	fprefect	lenix_	what average latency do you get, when pinging the other host?
2008-07-02T01:14:00.000Z	lenix_	fprefect	alright, guess i'll have to do a bit of a research.. although i posted the problem on ubuntuforums but still no replies
2008-07-02T01:17:00.000Z	lenix_	fprefect	 rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.121/0.147/0.161/0.013 ms
2008-07-02T01:18:00.000Z	fprefect	lenix_	looks good. my problem was related to peaks of high latency...
2008-07-02T01:18:00.000Z	lenix_	fprefect	it's really weird, im triple booting xp/vista/ubuntu ( settling on ubuntu these days ) .. but I might boot into vista and check the speed
2008-07-02T01:19:00.000Z	lenix_	fprefect	im getting a max of 1mbyte/sec on ubuntu
2008-07-02T01:19:00.000Z	fprefect	lenix_	strange
2008-07-02T01:19:00.000Z	fprefect	lenix_	anyway, gotta go, good luck
2008-07-02T01:19:00.000Z	lenix_	fprefect	alright mate, thanks for trying.. later
