2007-12-16T17:31:00.000Z	s_v_e_1	nixi	you can set it in /etc/defaults/powernowd
2007-12-16T17:32:00.000Z	nixi	s_v_e_1	also the range?
2007-12-16T17:33:00.000Z	nixi	s_v_e_1	so not only the steps?
2007-12-16T17:35:00.000Z	s_v_e_1	nixi	im not quite shure. if not there than you cat set it in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
2007-12-16T17:35:00.000Z	s_v_e_1		just echo "120000" > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
2007-12-16T17:36:00.000Z	nixi		s_v
2007-12-16T17:36:00.000Z	nixi	s_v_e_1	hm, but this is just the max frequence..
2007-12-16T17:37:00.000Z	s_v_e_1	nixi	there is also "min"   and have allok at cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies
2007-12-16T17:38:00.000Z	nixi	s_v_e_1	and i can edit it without damaging the hardware?
2007-12-16T17:38:00.000Z	nixi		so, not the max value, but the min?
2007-12-16T17:39:00.000Z	s_v_e_1	nixi	cou cant edit availible_frequalencies, but you cat sat min and max
2007-12-16T17:40:00.000Z	s_v_e_1	nixi	just gevi me second to start my petium mashine, to see how ive done
2007-12-16T17:40:00.000Z	nixi	s_v_e_1	its just, when i chance the min frequence from 1000000 to 800000 it will not damage the hardware..?
2007-12-16T17:42:00.000Z	s_v_e_1	nixi	you should only shoose from    cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies
2007-12-16T17:44:00.000Z	nixi	s_v_e_1	hm, but there the min is 1ghz...
2007-12-16T17:44:00.000Z	s_v_e_1	nixi	1GHz - thats it
2007-12-16T17:44:00.000Z	nixi	s_v_e_1	i cant get lower?
2007-12-16T17:45:00.000Z	s_v_e_1	nixi	i suppose not only availible. newer cpus dont have so mush frequalcies
2007-12-16T17:48:00.000Z	nixi	s_v_e_1	hmpf.. ok thx..
2007-12-16T17:50:00.000Z	nixi	s_v_e_1	with powersave u also can set the clock to whats available in scaling_available_frequencies ?
2007-12-16T17:51:00.000Z	nixi	s_v_e_1	and only into this?
2007-12-16T17:51:00.000Z	s_v_e_1	nixi	I dont know about powersafe but it should do it
