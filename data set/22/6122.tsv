2007-01-06T09:25:00.000Z	max1		Hello, when configuring samba I can't acces my /music folder. Where can I find it on my server and are the errors in the smb.conf file (altough running testparm didn't gave any errors) --> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/655/

2007-01-06T09:29:00.000Z	johns^	max1	do maxime, frederik and svenn have permissions to access /music?
2007-01-06T09:29:00.000Z	johns^	max1	linux permissions I mean :)
2007-01-06T09:30:00.000Z	max1	johns^	 I made a user maxime to test (adduser maxime)
2007-01-06T09:31:00.000Z	johns^	max1	no domain logons I guess?
2007-01-06T09:31:00.000Z	johns^	max1	did you do a smbpasswd -a maxime ?
2007-01-06T09:32:00.000Z	max1	johns^	 When I'm connecting with my windows pc it get's my ubuntu home folder (called 'maxime' ) and it sees the music folder but I cannot access it. In the logs i found it doesn't exist but where should it be? I created the folder using swat so I thought it would create the folder automatically
2007-01-06T09:32:00.000Z	max1	johns^	yes, I did
2007-01-06T09:32:00.000Z	johns^	max1	what are the permissions of /music
2007-01-06T09:32:00.000Z	max1	johns^	I don't know where the folder is?
2007-01-06T09:33:00.000Z	johns^	max1	so that's why you don't have access :)
2007-01-06T09:34:00.000Z	max1	johns^	I can't find it on my ubuntu server, but I thought SWAT would create it automatically..I wouldn't know where to create the /music folder myself? Under /etc or /var/lib/samba?
2007-01-06T09:35:00.000Z	johns^	max1	your smb.conf says path = /music so it's in /
2007-01-06T09:35:00.000Z	johns^	max1	I mount all my partitions in /media exept /home offcourse :)
2007-01-06T09:35:00.000Z	max1	johns^	I'll check, do you know where to check alle users allready registered with samba..a sort of overview?
2007-01-06T09:35:00.000Z	johns^	max1	but in case of a music dir, I would create it on a disk with enough space
2007-01-06T09:36:00.000Z	johns^	max1	normally you'll add them manually or witch a bash script
2007-01-06T09:37:00.000Z	johns^		ok I'm off. we're out to dinner. Have fun everybody ;)
2007-01-06T09:38:00.000Z	max1		johns^:but there isn't a command to show you all created userprofiles withing smb
2007-01-06T09:38:00.000Z	max1	johns^	the music folder works! thank you
2007-01-06T09:39:00.000Z	max1	johns^	probabely swat didn't create the folder...it keeps crashing all the time when commiting the changes, but again thanks
