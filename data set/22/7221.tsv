2008-10-13T07:06:00.000Z	MrKennie	sarixe	I don't think anyone understands what you want to accomplish.
2008-10-13T07:09:00.000Z	MrKennie	sarixe	you want to setup wireless on a box that has no monitor so you can ssh in?
2008-10-13T07:09:00.000Z	MrKennie	sarixe	It's pretty easy, good luck with that.
2008-10-13T07:10:00.000Z	MrKennie	sarixe	I would go encryptionless to start with
2008-10-13T07:11:00.000Z	sarixe	MrKennie	: true
2008-10-13T07:13:00.000Z	MrKennie	sarixe	iwconfig ath0 essid <youressid>

2008-10-13T07:13:00.000Z	MrKennie	sarixe	then dhcpcd ath0 and that should get it working if all goes well
