2006-04-24T07:42:00.000Z	harisund		Ok sure.
2006-04-24T07:42:00.000Z	harisund		Ok. Next, start editing (with sudo) the file /etc/inetd.conf so that it has one line, " ftpstreamtcpnowaitroot/usr/sbin/tcpd/usr/sbin/proftpd"
2006-04-24T07:44:00.000Z	harisund		Nooooooooooooooooooooooo King-of-pants not here.
2006-04-24T07:45:00.000Z	harisund		Thanks ops !
2006-04-24T07:45:00.000Z	IceTox	harisund	I should start it with "sudo sshd start" ?
2006-04-24T07:45:00.000Z	harisund	IceTox	What did you do to get a SSH server first?
2006-04-24T07:46:00.000Z	harisund	IceTox	By default only a SSH client gets installed with Ubuntu.
2006-04-24T07:46:00.000Z	IceTox	harisund	got it through apt-get
2006-04-24T07:46:00.000Z	harisund	IceTox	are you still there?
2006-04-24T07:47:00.000Z	harisund	IceTox	are you sure a SSH server is not already running? If you had installed it, generally it automatically starts running.
2006-04-24T07:47:00.000Z	IceTox	harisund	the apt-get version of it might have overwrited the previously installed ubuntu version? I haven't added any debian sources.
2006-04-24T07:47:00.000Z	harisund	IceTox	Previously installed? There is no previously installed version.
2006-04-24T07:47:00.000Z	IceTox	harisund	yes it's running, but I really wanna know how to start it again if I shut it down :-)
2006-04-24T07:47:00.000Z	harisund	IceTox	There is only a previously installed SSH client, and *NOT* a server.
2006-04-24T07:47:00.000Z	harisund	IceTox	Here are the commands for starting and shutting it down.
2006-04-24T07:48:00.000Z	harisund	IceTox	Start: "sudo invoke-rc.d ssh start" Stop: "sudo invoke-rc.d ssh stop"
2006-04-24T07:49:00.000Z	IceTox	harisund	isn't this like more of a redhat format? Like in debian you only start it with "sshd"
2006-04-24T07:49:00.000Z	harisund	IceTox	No, sshd is just a "daemon" that runs in the background.
2006-04-24T07:49:00.000Z	harisund	IceTox	the command I gave you is the Debian style. In Red Hat  you would have used something called "chkconfig"
2006-04-24T08:03:00.000Z	harisund	IceTox	I really don't know if there is anything that can do that on any operating system at all?
2006-04-24T08:04:00.000Z	IceTox	harisund	I know it's possible :-) I though maybe mount /media/cdrom would work, but it didn't.. So now, I'm stuck here with an open cdrom in front of me, and I'm determited to close it by command! :-)
2006-04-24T08:04:00.000Z	harisund	IceTox	haha.. All the best ! Do inform me if you find the commadn to do it. I would be very grateful.
