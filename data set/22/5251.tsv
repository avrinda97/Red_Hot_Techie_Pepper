2007-06-09T11:07:00.000Z	khermans	KEEEEV	su user
2007-06-09T11:10:00.000Z	KEEEEV	khermans	so if i reboot how could i get this users app to autostart?
2007-06-09T11:10:00.000Z	khermans	KEEEEV	huh?  on their desktop?
2007-06-09T11:10:00.000Z	KEEEEV	khermans	yes.
2007-06-09T11:11:00.000Z	khermans	KEEEEV	or add entry to /etc/rc.local, su user, do something
2007-06-09T11:16:00.000Z	KEEEEV	khermans	but if i added that line to  /etc/rc.local wouldnt i still have to enter my root passwd during boot?
2007-06-09T11:17:00.000Z	khermans	KEEEEV	rc.local runs in root contect and doesnt need password of lower user
2007-06-09T11:18:00.000Z	KEEEEV	khermans	thank you!
2007-06-09T11:18:00.000Z	khermans	KEEEEV	np
2007-06-09T11:18:00.000Z	KEEEEV	khermans	last question! is it ok to remove the exit 0 from  /etc/rc.local
2007-06-09T11:18:00.000Z	khermans	KEEEEV	it will just remain running
2007-06-09T11:19:00.000Z	khermans	KEEEEV	youll probabyl want to put your user program in the background with & but leave the exit 0
2007-06-09T11:20:00.000Z	KEEEEV	khermans	example: exit 0
2007-06-09T11:25:00.000Z	KEEEEV	khermans	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/24873/ . Dos this look correct?
2007-06-09T11:26:00.000Z	khermans	KEEEEV	put the exit 0 at the end
2007-06-09T11:26:00.000Z	khermans	KEEEEV	your script needs help though
2007-06-09T11:27:00.000Z	KEEEEV	khermans	yea.. im fresh off the windows boat :)
2007-06-09T11:27:00.000Z	khermans	KEEEEV	good to have you!
2007-06-09T11:27:00.000Z	khermans	KEEEEV	now what are you trying to accomplish?
