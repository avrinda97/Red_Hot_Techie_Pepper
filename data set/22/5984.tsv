2007-11-19T02:48:00.000Z	mozart		Question to the channel. Did loads of work on kernel netfilter and iptables userland utils so i'm familiar with the code deep down there. But i'm wondering if there are ubuntu 'GUI'-utils that can handle routing and firewalling (besides firestarter) or if there are projects working on this (which i can join).. can't seem to find much online
2007-11-19T02:49:00.000Z	PirateHead	mozart	Do you mean something that's Ubuntu-specific? Red Hat has a firewall configuration utility that's in Fedora 8, if you want to check that out.
2007-11-19T02:51:00.000Z	mozart	PirateHead	yes ubuntu specific. Really offtopic but: I'm currently in talks with some investors to open an shop much like the apple stores (offline) but with ubuntu hardware and our own fashion and designs. But i wan't some features both worked on by our own team and known to be supported. One of them is routing between more then two network connections, traffic management and firewalling (we developed anti-virus our selves). Wondering if th
2007-11-19T02:52:00.000Z	PirateHead	mozart	Is there a reason you don't like Firestarter?
2007-11-19T02:52:00.000Z	PirateHead	mozart	Very cool idea to have open source shops for comptuers, by the way!
2007-11-19T02:53:00.000Z	mozart	PirateHead	to limited support. It's based on firewalling, not traffic control, prioritizing and (advanced) routing. Still a very basic tool.. After some time (and application installs later), to difficult to configure.
2007-11-19T02:55:00.000Z	PirateHead	mozart	I don't know of a project determined to build a network control app more advanced than Firestarter, but if you're interested, I would suggest that you email the developer mailing list and post on the forum -- if you haven't already,.
2007-11-19T02:56:00.000Z	mozart	PirateHead	yes i working with the folks from freeswan/openswan / iptables / netfilter for years.. so i'm rounding up my own dev team for it.. but want to make sure i'm not doing double work..
2007-11-19T02:56:00.000Z	PirateHead	mozart	I've actually thought about it a lot before! I imagined that there would be lots of electronics stuff, sort of built around a do-it-yourself type theme.
2007-11-19T02:57:00.000Z	PirateHead	mozart	The people should be able to help you build your own box from scratch, install a custom OS on it (offer Windows as an option please!), and so on.
2007-11-19T02:57:00.000Z	mozart	PirateHead	indeed. I do want to bring it to the masses though. So i imaging a small number of hardware varieties.. but loads of accessoires just like with win32 and apple. Only thing i'm concerned about it crossover-office (win32 office compatibility) and gaming
2007-11-19T02:58:00.000Z	PirateHead	mozart	You could box and sell Linux games if you wanted, just like Apple stores have little sections of Mac games.
2007-11-19T02:59:00.000Z	PirateHead	mozart	Why limit yourself to Ubuntu though? Open source is about consumer choice, and that includes Windows and so on.
2007-11-19T02:59:00.000Z	PirateHead	mozart	If you build the store around do-it-yourself, rather than a particular operating system distribution, I would think you would do better.
2007-11-19T03:00:00.000Z	mozart	PirateHead	i think it's a business reason. Love to do otherwise, but for it to be succesfull i am convinced ubuntu should become a 'fashion'-brand or fashionable brand. Just like apple is.
2007-11-19T03:00:00.000Z	mozart	PirateHead	i like that idea.. difficult concept, but like it very very much
2007-11-19T03:01:00.000Z	PirateHead	mozart	Ubuntu is about do it yourself. Low barriers to entry, open source and community, the spirit of contribution from everybody. An Ubuntu store should encourage the same thing, but with hardware and real friendly faces to talk to.
2007-11-19T03:02:00.000Z	PirateHead	mozart	If you stake it all on the "hip" factor, then you're competing directly with Apple, and chances are Apple will out-hip you up and down the street with its huge marketing budgets, R&D teams, and so on.
2007-11-19T03:02:00.000Z	mozart	PirateHead	good point. We though of a contributors corner with a bunch of system. Like if you sit down and do translations or ubuntu-related code contributions, you get discounts et cetera. Eventually just having a steady bunch of guys sitting there.. helping out, us, the community, the customers. A big familiarity idea
2007-11-19T03:03:00.000Z	PirateHead	mozart	Actual software support for Ubuntu would be huge. A place where people can do when stuff stops working, or where they can take their computer to get Ubuntu installed on it by a friendly computer pro.
2007-11-19T03:04:00.000Z	PirateHead	mozart	I think a lot more people would be open to switching away from Windows if they had a place they could go for tech support and professional assistance.
2007-11-19T03:04:00.000Z	PirateHead	mozart	And it ties directly into your hardware sales, because then when they want a new computer they'll know about you and already be familiar with your store.
