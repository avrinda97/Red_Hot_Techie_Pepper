2006-05-27T16:01:00.000Z	CokeNCode		hey, how do i start a telnet or ftp daemon in ubunut ?
2006-05-27T16:02:00.000Z	Ng	CokeNCode	are you sure you want a telnet daemon? it's not at all secure
2006-05-27T16:02:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Ng	 yeh, i know, i'm just fooling around, there's nothing on this pc
2006-05-27T16:03:00.000Z	Ng	CokeNCode	the default install is pretty minimal and doesn't install any remotely accessible services for security reasons
2006-05-27T16:09:00.000Z	Ng	CokeNCode	what kind of errors?
2006-05-30T08:10:00.000Z	Ng	CokeNCode	the first step is to install the build-essential package
2006-05-30T08:11:00.000Z	Ng	CokeNCode	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2006-05-30T08:12:00.000Z	Ng	CokeNCode	yes, but you could always use screen to run both in a single terminal
2006-05-30T08:14:00.000Z	Ng	CokeNCode	install any development packages you need and get compiling :)
2006-05-30T08:14:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Ng	hmmm, ok thanks
2006-05-30T08:15:00.000Z	Ng	CokeNCode	are you wanting to write code or compile other people's?
2006-05-30T08:15:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Ng	a bit of both actually
2006-05-30T08:15:00.000Z	Ng	CokeNCode	you could use something like anjuta to write your own and most of the time, source releases include enough magic scripts that you can just do "./configure && make && sudo make install"
2006-05-30T08:16:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Ng	ok, i downloaded anjuta ... does it have a gui front end ?
2006-05-30T08:17:00.000Z	Ng	CokeNCode	yes, anjuta *is* a graphical frontend (or rather, a full development environment)
2006-05-30T09:38:00.000Z	Ng	CokeNCode	because it's very poorly written
2006-07-26T06:32:00.000Z	Ng	CokeNCode	how are you setting the options?
2006-07-26T06:32:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Ng	modprobe saa7134 options card=2 tuner=2
2006-07-26T06:33:00.000Z	Ng	CokeNCode	when you want to change them, rmmod saa7134 and do another modprobe
2006-07-26T06:33:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Ng	oh ok ... thanks ... and that takes immediate effect ? for the next time i load up tvtime ?
2006-07-26T06:34:00.000Z	Ng	CokeNCode	yep, when you rmmod it you're unloading the module, so the next modprobe can set new options
2006-07-26T06:34:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Ng	thanks alot
