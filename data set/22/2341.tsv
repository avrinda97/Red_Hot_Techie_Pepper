2010-05-28T02:46:00.000Z	Green_		Well my problem (right now) is that when i boot into my newly installed Ubuntu Server, I get "[   0.530002] Kernel panic - not syncing: VPS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)"
2010-05-28T02:47:00.000Z	Green_		Oh and the keyboard lights are flashing
2010-05-28T02:48:00.000Z	Green_		have no idea how to do any of those
2010-05-28T02:48:00.000Z	Green_		I don't even a command line, so I'm not sure how that could help
2010-05-28T02:49:00.000Z	Green_		even have*
2010-05-28T02:49:00.000Z	Green_		One HD, one partition
2010-05-28T02:50:00.000Z	sjm	Green_	New install?
2010-05-28T02:50:00.000Z	Green_	sjm	yeo
2010-05-28T02:50:00.000Z	sjm	Green_	known good drive?  Known good install cd?
2010-05-28T02:51:00.000Z	sjm	Green_	 I'd suspect the HD is bad and maybe check that, too.
2010-05-28T02:52:00.000Z	Green_	sjm	I verified the CD on burn, and ran spinrite on the HD, so i think they are ok
2010-05-28T02:54:00.000Z	Green_	sjm	ran a full SpinRite run, just found one bad sector, and did whatever it does to it, so it's not there anymore
2010-05-28T02:54:00.000Z	sjm	Green_	then not sure, sorry.
2010-05-28T02:54:00.000Z	Green_	sjm	oh the number i get changes every time, if that's important
2010-05-28T02:55:00.000Z	sjm	Green_	which number?
2010-05-28T02:56:00.000Z	sjm	Green_	sorry, getting out of sphere where I can help.
2010-05-28T03:03:00.000Z	sjm	Green_	but like h00k said, only from the live cd.  You don't want to do it to a mounted drive.
2010-05-28T03:03:00.000Z	Green_	sjm	can i do it from the server installation cd?
2010-05-28T03:04:00.000Z	sjm	Green_	not sure, as I haven't done a server install for a while.  If the server cd gives you a regular shell, then probably.
2010-05-28T03:05:00.000Z	sjm	Green_	in the shell run "fdisk -l" to find which device the HD is
2010-05-28T03:06:00.000Z	sjm	Green_	use fdisk -l to get the hdd info then fsck -c -v -p /dev/sda
2010-05-28T03:06:00.000Z	sjm	Green_	what forkup said.  (I forgot the partition on the drive)
