2006-02-23T07:42:00.000Z	unix_infidel		how do i start apache in ubuntu?
2006-02-23T07:43:00.000Z	_jason	unix_infidel	did you install it?
2006-02-23T07:44:00.000Z	unix_infidel	_jason	says that httpd.conf not found?
2006-02-23T07:44:00.000Z	_jason	unix_infidel	shouldn't have to... how did you install it?
2006-02-23T07:45:00.000Z	unix_infidel	_jason	yea.
2006-02-23T07:45:00.000Z	_jason	unix_infidel	did you install apache or apache2?
2006-02-23T07:45:00.000Z	_jason	unix_infidel	ok, never set that up then.  Why not install apache2?
2006-02-23T07:46:00.000Z	unix_infidel	_jason	no idea.
2006-02-23T07:46:00.000Z	_jason	unix_infidel	i'd remove the one you installed and install apache2 personally
2006-02-23T07:48:00.000Z	unix_infidel	_jason	did that as soon as you mentioned apache 2.
2006-02-23T07:48:00.000Z	_jason	unix_infidel	:)
2006-02-23T07:48:00.000Z	unix_infidel	_jason	where does apache keep its cache though in ubuntu?
2006-02-23T07:49:00.000Z	_jason	unix_infidel	yeah, /var/www
2006-02-23T07:50:00.000Z	unix_infidel	_jason	will apache start on this thing from now on?
2006-02-23T07:50:00.000Z	_jason	unix_infidel	yes
2006-02-23T07:51:00.000Z	unix_infidel	_jason	how would i disable that, simply by /etc/init.d/apache2 stop?
2006-02-23T07:51:00.000Z	_jason	unix_infidel	that would stop it, but it would still load every time you boot
2006-02-23T07:51:00.000Z	unix_infidel	_jason	how do i disable that?
2006-02-23T07:52:00.000Z	_jason	unix_infidel	well you could use update-rc.d to remove the symlink.  That's how I would do it, but I don't know if there is a ``better'' way
2006-02-23T07:53:00.000Z	unix_infidel	_jason	i'm asking for the proper wya.
2006-02-24T11:19:00.000Z	_jason	unix_infidel	you probably need to logout and back in or something if that's right and you can't figure out why it doesn't work
2006-02-24T11:20:00.000Z	unix_infidel	_jason	i've logged out a couple times and shutdown and wha tnot.
