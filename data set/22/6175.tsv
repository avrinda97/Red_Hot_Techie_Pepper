2007-12-04T07:18:00.000Z	j3g		i have a box that is restarting almost precisely every hour... anyone know what could cause this?
2007-12-04T07:19:00.000Z	jsoftw	j3g	is it power management related?
2007-12-04T07:19:00.000Z	j3g	jsoftw	don't know... it simply reboots... no warnings on the logs
2007-12-04T07:19:00.000Z	jsoftw	j3g	is it idle?
2007-12-04T07:19:00.000Z	j3g	jsoftw	not really.. but not on high load... it's a quad.. using like 2-5%
2007-12-04T07:20:00.000Z	jsoftw	j3g	no I mean is it headless, ie, you are not actually actively on it
2007-12-04T07:20:00.000Z	jsoftw		physically
2007-12-04T07:20:00.000Z	j3g	jsoftw	 yes its headless... take a look that the rebooot times.... http://pastebin.com/m241d35
2007-12-04T07:20:00.000Z	jsoftw	j3g	I would investigate power related things, see if its set to power down or whatever
2007-12-04T07:20:00.000Z	jsoftw		erm, suspend I mean
2007-12-04T07:20:00.000Z	j3g	jsoftw	i changed it's name from venus to sol but it is the same box
2007-12-04T07:21:00.000Z	jsoftw	j3g	yeah look at what I mentioned
2007-12-04T07:21:00.000Z	jsoftw	j3g	and look in crontabs
2007-12-04T07:21:00.000Z	j3g	jsoftw	i'll go there tomorrow.. can't check it from here
2007-12-04T07:21:00.000Z	jsoftw	j3g	adn what not
2007-12-04T07:21:00.000Z	j3g	jsoftw	only hourly job on crontab was ntpdate to my local ntp server (i commented it out... )

2007-12-04T07:22:00.000Z	jsoftw		Weird.
