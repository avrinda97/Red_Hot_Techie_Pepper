2009-01-11T01:59:00.000Z	SiDi	K-4U	hm the guy's repo is down. Let me have a look
2009-01-11T01:54:00.000Z	SiDi	K-4U	did you try easycam ? see easycam in help.ubuntu.com
2009-01-11T01:55:00.000Z	K-4U	SiDi	Not yet, let's try
2009-01-11T01:55:00.000Z	K-4U	SiDi	err, wait, yes.. i tried.. but the packages don't fit.. these are for hardy, and i'm using intrepid
2009-01-11T01:56:00.000Z	SiDi	K-4U	let me check for the intrepid version on french wiki ;)
2009-01-11T01:56:00.000Z	K-4U	SiDi	okay, ty :)
2009-01-11T01:57:00.000Z	SiDi	K-4U	i think you can use this one, we got the hardy one only in our wiki too (the guy who devs it is french thus we have latest info on easycam)
2009-01-11T01:58:00.000Z	SiDi	K-4U	i used it under intrepid for my lappy and i had no problem. Just don't forget to remove the repository once your webcam is installed
2009-01-11T01:58:00.000Z	SiDi	K-4U	easycam will only install your drivers but then you can remove it safely ;)
2009-01-11T01:58:00.000Z	K-4U	SiDi	I added it to my sources.list, but it said this:W: Ophalen van http://blognux.free.fr/ubuntu/dists/hardy/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz 404 Not Found is mislukt
2009-01-11T02:01:00.000Z	SiDi	K-4U	can you tell me what webcam you have ? i'll try to find the drivers on his webby
2009-01-11T02:01:00.000Z	K-4U	SiDi	I have a Trust WB-1400T, yes i know.. linux doesn't like it
2009-01-11T02:03:00.000Z	K-4U	SiDi	Whut? I had it working.. once.. it was.. 7.04 i think
2009-01-11T02:03:00.000Z	SiDi	K-4U	its not in the list of easycam's compatible cams so it won't work from you = no need to go further with easycam, you'll have to find the drivers the usual way :/
2009-01-11T02:04:00.000Z	K-4U	SiDi	Okay... not good.. someone told me the gspcav modules..
2009-01-11T02:04:00.000Z	SiDi	K-4U	well i wish you good luck with it.
2009-01-11T02:05:00.000Z	K-4U	SiDi	Well.. thanks.. i guess..
2009-01-11T02:05:00.000Z	SiDi	K-4U	by the way if you fiind something, let me know and i'll forward to easycam's dev
2009-01-11T02:05:00.000Z	K-4U	SiDi	Okay, i'll try.. the only problem i have atm is the compile error from gspcav..
2009-01-11T02:07:00.000Z	K-4U	SiDi	http://paste.ubuntu.com/103239/ <-- this is the error
2009-01-11T02:09:00.000Z	SiDi	K-4U	i'm saving it. If you find the working drivers, you can find me on this irc and let me know and i'll post at the dev's blog
2009-01-11T02:09:00.000Z	K-4U	SiDi	I will do my best ;)
