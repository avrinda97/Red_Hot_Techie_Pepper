2010-07-03T05:12:00.000Z	jake_		hi all
2010-07-03T05:13:00.000Z	jake_		I am having all the trouble in the world trying to get my sound going. I have an intel D865GLC mobo, with 82801EB/ER on board sound
2010-07-03T05:14:00.000Z	jake_		i even removed my tv card, which shard an irq with it. I have had issues in the past with that card not sharing
2010-07-03T05:15:00.000Z	MaRk-I	jake_	press alt-f2 type: padevchooser
2010-07-03T05:19:00.000Z	jake_	MaRk-I	I have padevchooser installed. Its an applet, correct? There are many options, which should I look for?
2010-07-03T05:19:00.000Z	MaRk-I	jake_	go to volume control
2010-07-03T05:21:00.000Z	MaRk-I	jake_	"Analog
2010-07-03T05:21:00.000Z	jake_	MaRk-I	I have no configuration tab. I went "volume control -> preferences -> output" and observed that the "connector" value was set to "Analog Output / Amplified"
2010-07-03T05:22:00.000Z	jake_	MaRk-I	I'll change it now to *Analog stereo duplex"
2010-07-03T05:23:00.000Z	jake_	MaRk-I	Okay, I went "volume control -> preferences -> Hardware" and changed the profile option to "analog stereo duplex"
2010-07-03T05:23:00.000Z	MaRk-I	jake_	ok log out of ur desktop log back in should work
2010-07-03T05:24:00.000Z	jake_	MaRk-I	oh okay. I'll give it a go. Maybe not logging out was the issue I was having all along
2010-07-03T05:24:00.000Z	jake_	MaRk-I	there is no sounds playing right now, hopefully a log out will fix it
2010-07-03T05:24:00.000Z	MaRk-I	jake_	 you need to restart pulse to take efect
2010-07-03T05:28:00.000Z	jake_	MaRk-I	that didn't seem to work
2010-07-03T05:28:00.000Z	MaRk-I	jake_	you dont have sound system wide or just a specific program?
2010-07-03T05:30:00.000Z	jake_	MaRk-I	system wide. Nothing plays
2010-07-03T05:30:00.000Z	MaRk-I	jake_	dang, sorry I have also an intel sound and that usually the problem the "analog"
2010-07-03T05:31:00.000Z	jake_	MaRk-I	lsmod gives me snd_intel8x0 amoung other things
2010-07-03T05:31:00.000Z	jake_	MaRk-I	okay thanks anyway. Maybe I should chuck my yamaha ymf724 in and diusable onboard and see if that works
2010-07-03T05:32:00.000Z	MaRk-I	jake_	 good luck
2010-07-03T05:32:00.000Z	jake_	MaRk-I	np :)
