2010-11-27T17:18:00.000Z	shmup		this isn't really ubuntu related but..
2010-11-27T17:19:00.000Z	shmup		shouldn't i see .vimrc in my /home/username?
2010-11-27T17:19:00.000Z	shmup		mk
2010-11-27T17:19:00.000Z	histo	shmup	if you made it
2010-11-27T17:20:00.000Z	histo	shmup	there may be an example in docs somewhere try using locate vimrc
2010-11-27T17:22:00.000Z	histo	shmup	it should be installed by default
2010-11-27T17:22:00.000Z	histo	shmup	okay well after it's installed sudo updatedb then you can locate something
2010-11-27T17:23:00.000Z	shmup	histo	nothing, so i shall create one.
2010-11-27T17:23:00.000Z	histo	shmup	let me check hold up
2010-11-27T17:23:00.000Z	shmup	histo	i'd like a nice vanilla one to start with.
2010-11-27T17:23:00.000Z	shmup	histo	mk.
2010-11-27T17:24:00.000Z	histo	shmup	/usr/share/vim/vimrc and /usr/share/vim/vimrc.tiny
2010-11-27T17:24:00.000Z	histo	shmup	or you can find examples online
2010-11-27T17:24:00.000Z	shmup	histo	i wonder why you had 'em by default?
2010-11-27T17:24:00.000Z	shmup	histo	but you're more or less telling me they have to go there? or just that you have 'em there and i should look.
2010-11-27T17:24:00.000Z	histo	shmup	I don't know what version of ubuntu you are running but locate should have been installed
2010-11-27T17:25:00.000Z	histo	shmup	I would look there. they are there on my install be default
2010-11-27T17:25:00.000Z	shmup	histo	wow i do have 'em..
2010-11-27T17:25:00.000Z	shmup	histo	i wonder why locate didn't yield anything
2010-11-27T17:25:00.000Z	shmup	histo	i had to sudo :P
2010-11-27T17:27:00.000Z	histo	shmup	I believe vim's default behavior should use .vimrc .
2010-11-27T17:27:00.000Z	histo	shmup	you may want to join #vim for more help
