2011-07-15T01:53:00.000Z	Gump	James3	what is your video card?
2011-07-15T01:53:00.000Z	James3	Gump	 I am not sure, I have a new Sony Vaio with bluray,,,,
2011-07-15T01:53:00.000Z	Gump	James3	run lspci in terminal, and tell me what your video card is
2011-07-15T01:54:00.000Z	Gump		ooh. well if James3 has nvidia, you help him, cause i only know how to do this for ATI cards
2011-07-15T01:54:00.000Z	James3	Gump	 why does my viode card matter?  why cant I just reset the resolution somwhere?
2011-07-15T01:54:00.000Z	James3		wtf?
2011-07-15T01:55:00.000Z	James3		ubuntu works fine with my laptop, the resolution is very high and excellent, but when i plug the HDMI into my laptop to my TV, it thros it into low res
2011-07-15T01:55:00.000Z	James3		how do I change it back to high res
2011-07-15T01:56:00.000Z	James3		aparently its a 3650
2011-07-15T01:56:00.000Z	Gump	James3	the HDMI cable is coming from your video card...
2011-07-15T01:56:00.000Z	James3		ATI Inc Mobility Radeon HD 3650
2011-07-15T01:56:00.000Z	Gump		ok
2011-07-15T01:56:00.000Z	James3		dude, the HDMI is plugged into the only place it can be plugged into the laptop\
2011-07-15T01:57:00.000Z	James3		I have done this for years on windows, never had an issue
2011-07-15T01:57:00.000Z	James3		i dont know why ubuntu is throwing it into like really low resolution
2011-07-15T01:57:00.000Z	James3		the resolution is so low i can only see 1/8 of my screen
2011-07-15T01:57:00.000Z	Gump	James3	it's because you don't have the right drivers installed or you aren't in your driver settings
2011-07-15T01:57:00.000Z	Gump		run "sudo aptitude install fglrx"
2011-07-15T01:58:00.000Z	James3	Gump	I ran that and it says audo: aptitude: command not found
2011-07-15T01:59:00.000Z	Gump		i use debian, so ubuntu may need apt-get
2011-07-15T01:59:00.000Z	Gump	James3	follow the directions on this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
