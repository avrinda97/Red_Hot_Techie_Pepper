2005-10-09T07:12:00.000Z	AngryParsley		and I don't want to take the time to rerip them
2005-10-09T07:13:00.000Z	AngryParsley		and it's a 200 gig drive
2005-10-09T07:14:00.000Z	AngryParsley		the captive ntfs driver looks like the best bet
2005-10-09T07:14:00.000Z	AngryParsley		thanks
2005-10-09T07:14:00.000Z	AngryParsley		T_T
2005-10-09T07:16:00.000Z	AngryParsley		oh cool, now that I installed ntfsprogs gparted lets me resize ntfs partitions
2005-10-09T07:16:00.000Z	AngryParsley		less messing with partition tables for me
2005-10-09T07:18:00.000Z	AngryParsley		weird, gparted did nothing
2005-10-09T07:19:00.000Z	AngryParsley		I told it to resize, clicked apply, and it just left everything the same
2005-10-09T07:19:00.000Z	crimsun	AngryParsley	did you try to resize the _beginning_ of the partition?
2005-10-09T07:19:00.000Z	AngryParsley	crimsun	what do you mean?
2005-10-09T07:19:00.000Z	crimsun	AngryParsley	parted-based tools can't resize if you move the beginning of a partition
2005-10-09T13:28:00.000Z	crimsun	AngryParsley	submit a bug for gtkpod to make it use whatever jhymn's backend is
2005-10-09T13:30:00.000Z	crimsun	AngryParsley	what application?
2005-10-09T13:30:00.000Z	AngryParsley	crimsun	gtkpod
2005-10-09T13:30:00.000Z	crimsun	AngryParsley	you should submit a bug on that application instead of yelling here, since we can't really help that
2005-10-09T13:30:00.000Z	AngryParsley	crimsun	it looks like the software hasn't been updated in over a year
2005-10-09T13:33:00.000Z	AngryParsley	crimsun	yeah, I did that, and it took me forever
2005-10-09T13:33:00.000Z	crimsun	AngryParsley	using java-package?
2005-10-09T13:34:00.000Z	AngryParsley	crimsun	yeah, I think so
2005-10-09T13:35:00.000Z	AngryParsley	crimsun	see? I don't want to mess with environment variables, I want to install java
2005-10-09T13:41:00.000Z	AngryParsley	crimsun	so it gets rid of outdated packages?
