2011-10-15T05:48:00.000Z	robin0800	Aleo	you edit /etc/default/grub
2011-10-15T05:54:00.000Z	robin0800	Aleo	you need dconf these days
2011-10-15T07:54:00.000Z	Aleo	robin0800	I don't have the appearance icon on settings, is this normal, I installed today Ubuntu last version
2011-10-15T07:56:00.000Z	robin0800	Aleo	you should have its the first one under personnel
2011-10-15T07:58:00.000Z	robin0800	Aleo	 if you want sceensavers the workaround is to uninstall gnome screensaver and install any others you want
2011-10-15T08:07:00.000Z	robin0800	Aleo	http://www.webupd8.org/2011/10/things-to-tweak-after-installing-ubuntu.html has more details
2011-10-15T08:08:00.000Z	Aleo	robin0800	thks going to see
2011-10-17T01:12:00.000Z	robin0800	Aleo	try using confity to change them
2011-10-17T01:12:00.000Z	Aleo	robin0800	confity is installed by the software manager ?
2011-10-17T04:41:00.000Z	Aleo	robin0800	hi again, do you know why I can't drop the unity launcher icons to re organize them, I have seen this on a video, can it be for being on a virtual box ? I have set 3 GB ram to the Ubuntu and the graphics board is fast
2011-10-17T04:44:00.000Z	robin0800	Aleo	you can only move some of them think order may be changed using dconf not sure
2011-10-17T04:46:00.000Z	Aleo	robin0800	hmm, don't know if I have dconf, but also saw a video of a guy using compiz and unity plugin that I have here, and the guy resize the laucher icons as it moves the icon slider size, but here I do the same and nothing happens
2011-10-17T04:47:00.000Z	robin0800	Aleo	think that's broke install confity to do that
2011-10-17T04:48:00.000Z	Aleo	robin0800	I could not install confity, I followed the instructions but could no install, don't know why., which they have a deb package
2011-10-17T04:49:00.000Z	robin0800	Aleo	only version 1.0 but that works for me
2011-10-17T04:49:00.000Z	Aleo	robin0800	can you give me the url for that version with deb package ?
2011-10-17T04:51:00.000Z	robin0800	Aleo	it should be on the same source forge page but can;t check here sorry
2011-10-17T04:52:00.000Z	Aleo	robin0800	thank anyway going to search :)
2011-10-17T05:04:00.000Z	Aleo	robin0800	installed confity 1.0, I set the laucher size to 32 but no changes, going to log off and in
