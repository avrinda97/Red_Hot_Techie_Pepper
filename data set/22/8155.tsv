2006-03-16T16:25:00.000Z	gopi		I installed freevo successfully but when I try to invoke it by doing ./freevo it says something..... Can anyone help me in sorting it out ?

2006-03-16T16:33:00.000Z	gopi	erUSUL	So it is fine.... but what else I can do? :(
2006-03-16T16:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	gopi	you have to copy a file named local_conf.py.example to /home/gopi/.freevo/local_conf.py. it says it comes with freevo
2006-03-16T16:36:00.000Z	gopi	erUSUL	yeah I did that too...... let me show what it said

2006-03-16T16:40:00.000Z	gopi	erUSUL	seeing it ?
2006-03-16T16:41:00.000Z	gopi	erUSUL	are u there ?
2006-03-16T16:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	gopi	you have to set some variables in the file. edit it. also you need to create a directory named /var/cache/freevo. you need to install some dependencies too. i think is to much work for newbie
2006-03-16T16:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	gopi	have you tried to look for a prepackaged version or to use mythtv?
2006-03-16T16:42:00.000Z	gopi	erUSUL	I tried to create directory... but its not possible to create directory in /var/cache !!
2006-03-16T16:43:00.000Z	gopi	erUSUL	yes mythtv I struggled a lot to install :(
2006-03-16T16:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	gopi	you have to create it as root. with sudo.
2006-03-16T16:43:00.000Z	gopi	erUSUL	Others like Zapper and TVtime viewer.... i am getting audio but no video :(
2006-03-16T16:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	gopi	mythtv is in repositories you only have to fire up synaptic and install it
2006-03-16T16:45:00.000Z	gopi	erUSUL	FYI, mine is an Athlon64 system but Iam using Ubuntu for AMD64
