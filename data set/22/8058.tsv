2005-10-28T07:47:00.000Z	bob2		uh?
2005-10-28T07:47:00.000Z	bob2		ldconfig will not affect running processes
2005-10-28T07:47:00.000Z	bob2		e.g. your ssh connection will not be affected
2005-10-28T07:48:00.000Z	warreng	bob2	hate to differ
2005-10-28T07:49:00.000Z	bob2	warreng	perhaps it consumed so much cpu or disk io that ssh didn't get to run
2005-10-28T15:44:00.000Z	bob2	warreng	netapplet, network-manager
2005-10-28T15:45:00.000Z	warreng	bob2	will either of those sit in a panel?
2005-10-28T15:45:00.000Z	bob2	warreng	indeed
2005-10-28T15:46:00.000Z	warreng	bob2	should i use both of those? or should i pick one?
2005-10-29T16:11:00.000Z	bob2	warreng	add it to your gnome session, system -> preferences -> session
2005-10-30T07:10:00.000Z	bob2	warreng	what are you trying to do?
2005-10-30T07:11:00.000Z	warreng	bob2	use apxs
2005-10-30T07:11:00.000Z	bob2	warreng	to build *what*?
2005-10-30T07:12:00.000Z	warreng	bob2	i'm trying to create a custom version of mod_auth_mysql... so i'm rewriting that mod
2005-10-30T07:13:00.000Z	bob2	warreng	apt-cache --names-only search apache dev
2005-10-30T07:13:00.000Z	bob2	warreng	you need a specific one
2005-10-30T07:13:00.000Z	bob2	warreng	also, I'd think modifying the existing libapache-mod-mysql-auth package would be less hassle
2005-10-30T07:15:00.000Z	warreng	bob2	apache-dev only.. i don't see apache2-dev at all in apt-cache
2005-10-30T07:15:00.000Z	bob2	warreng	yes, I know, that's not what I told you to search for
2005-10-30T07:16:00.000Z	warreng	bob2	OHHHH.... i saw prefork and threaded, and i figured those were for the mpm modules, not the apahce itself
2005-10-30T07:17:00.000Z	warreng	bob2	you rock.. thanks :)
2005-10-30T07:17:00.000Z	bob2	warreng	tho it does make me wonder if every libapache2-mod-whatever package includes three copies of each module
