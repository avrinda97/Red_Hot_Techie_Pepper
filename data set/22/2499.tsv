2009-05-31T18:49:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	LuciusMare	Do you happen to know the specs of your old notebook?
2009-05-31T18:53:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	LuciusMare	You might want to try Puppy Linux.
2009-05-31T18:54:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	LuciusMare	What is the specs of your beat-up notebook?
2009-05-31T18:55:00.000Z	LuciusMare	mobi-sheep	google Travelmate 240
2009-05-31T18:59:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	LuciusMare	Your laptop is a weak.  I personally would install Minimal.iso / Server.iso and install text-based applications.  Avoid the GUI. :)
2009-05-31T18:59:00.000Z	LuciusMare	mobi-sheep	yes
2009-05-31T19:00:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	LuciusMare	finch for AIM.  elinks (and one more software I can't remember) for web-browser, irssi for IRC.  mc for file manager.  rtorrent for torrent.  All text-based.  You get the idea.  Really smooth. :)
2009-05-31T19:01:00.000Z	LuciusMare	mobi-sheep	i have some torrents started already and i dont know if another program could continue them
2009-05-31T19:02:00.000Z	LuciusMare	mobi-sheep	i have some torrents started already and i dont know if another program could continue them.Could it do that?
2009-05-31T19:02:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	LuciusMare	What do you mean?
2009-05-31T19:03:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	LuciusMare	It's your laptop.  You have better idea than I do because I don't like to work with slow machines.
2009-05-31T19:09:00.000Z	LuciusMare	mobi-sheep	i mean that i downloaded a lot of the files already and i am not sure if another program can continue downloading them when another program stopped downloading

2009-05-31T19:17:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	LuciusMare	You don't want to toggle anything much.  Then from there, you'll have aptitude / apt-get.  Installing packages and whatnot.  It'll be tricky for you.
2009-05-31T19:17:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	LuciusMare	You can change your X to something more light.  XFCE / OpenBox OpenFlux / etc.
2009-05-31T19:18:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	LuciusMare	Try #xubuntu for better support on slimming down.
