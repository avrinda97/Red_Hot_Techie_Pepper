2005-04-13T13:26:00.000Z	caffinated		the TI series was dated, but nice hardware.
2005-04-13T13:26:00.000Z	caffinated		I'd probably go for a FX5900 series or better myself though.  assuming you've got the cash to spend.
2005-04-13T13:27:00.000Z	caffinated		if you don't play games, it really doesn't matter.
2005-04-13T13:28:00.000Z	caffinated		bargain bins kick ass
2005-04-13T13:28:00.000Z	caffinated		works great in linux too
2005-04-13T13:29:00.000Z	caffinated		don't forget flashlight, shotgun, flashlight, shotgun, flashlight...
2005-04-13T13:30:00.000Z	caffinated		they need duct tape for doom3
2005-04-13T13:30:00.000Z	caffinated		tape that damn flashlight to the shotgun
2005-04-13T13:31:00.000Z	caffinated		hl2 is only good if you have the hardware to run it
2005-04-13T13:31:00.000Z	caffinated		that game is hungry for hardware
2005-04-13T13:33:00.000Z	e_machinist	caffinated	ATI has made decent drivers for awhile now... not so for us poor poor linux hobos though.
2005-04-13T13:34:00.000Z	caffinated	e_machinist	it's been my experience that ATI is really sub-par with it's drivers.  on windows and linux.
2005-04-13T13:35:00.000Z	caffinated	e_machinist	you're lucky then.  there are some serious issues with ATI cards and some games.
2005-04-13T13:35:00.000Z	e_machinist	caffinated	I should start counting my ATI blessings then.
2005-04-13T13:36:00.000Z	caffinated	e_machinist	the only time I'd recommend ATI is in the mobility market, where they seem to excel.
2005-04-13T13:43:00.000Z	caffinated	e_machinist	it's a complete ] [e / //gs emulator in a browser.
2005-04-13T13:43:00.000Z	caffinated	e_machinist	and they did an amazing job.
2005-04-13T13:44:00.000Z	caffinated	e_machinist	it probably wouldn't interest you unless you're at least 27.
2005-04-13T13:56:00.000Z	caffinated	e_machinist	not really.  you can get it out of the hoary repos
2005-04-13T13:56:00.000Z	caffinated	e_machinist	so, you didn't actually "tell me" anything.
2005-04-13T13:57:00.000Z	e_machinist	caffinated	doesn't matter, I already downloaded it from mozilla. haha. You guys forget how to do good ol' fashioned downloading and installing?
2005-04-13T13:57:00.000Z	caffinated	e_machinist	not at all.  i just see no point to it if it's already in a working package.,
