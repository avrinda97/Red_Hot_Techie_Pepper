2009-05-24T23:26:00.000Z	bn43		hello I am trying to resize my disk as I am running out of space on / - I downloaded gparted but that does not allow me to resize even though I have free space
2009-05-24T23:28:00.000Z	chaosphere	bn43	you mustn't resize / when running. Boot from a live cd
2009-05-24T23:28:00.000Z	bn43	chaosphere	i am running off the gparted cd
2009-05-24T23:29:00.000Z	chaosphere	bn43	oh ok. did gparted resized the other partition? (That you are trying to get some space from.)
2009-05-24T23:30:00.000Z	bn43	chaosphere	yes - but when I try to resize /dev/sda1, does not show the free space
2009-05-24T23:31:00.000Z	chaosphere	bn43	check if 'df' and 'parted' show diffent sizes of /. for additional info: 'man df' and 'man parted'
2009-05-24T23:33:00.000Z	bn43	chaosphere	is the same
2009-05-24T23:36:00.000Z	chaosphere	bn43	hm strage. That was what i encountered when resizing a partition. and the other partition is smaller in size?
2009-05-24T23:37:00.000Z	bn43	chaosphere	no - much bigger - does that make a difference? and I have ext4 on all
2009-05-24T23:39:00.000Z	chaosphere	bn43	but didn't you tryed to make the other one smaller to "give" the space to your root dir?
2009-05-24T23:39:00.000Z	bn43	chaosphere	oh yes sorry - misunderstood - yes I did
2009-05-24T23:40:00.000Z	chaosphere	bn43	so where's the space gone? check again with parted
2009-05-24T23:42:00.000Z	bn43	chaosphere	its under "extended"
2009-05-24T23:46:00.000Z	chaosphere	bn43	ok then try with gparted to make extended smaller. any ideas why the free space has gone to extended?
2009-05-24T23:46:00.000Z	bn43	chaosphere	http://pastebin.com/deabf5c
2009-05-24T23:50:00.000Z	bn43	chaosphere	I think its because I mounted /home on its own partition
2009-05-24T23:50:00.000Z	chaosphere	bn43	why do partition 3 and 5 both start @ 10gig?
2009-05-24T23:51:00.000Z	bn43	chaosphere	/home starts on that
2009-05-24T23:52:00.000Z	chaosphere	bn43	sorry no idea
2009-05-24T23:52:00.000Z	bn43	chaosphere	me too!
2009-05-24T23:52:00.000Z	bn43	chaosphere	thanks tho
2009-05-24T23:52:00.000Z	chaosphere	bn43	not at all
