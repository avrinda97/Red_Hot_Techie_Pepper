2007-12-29T19:36:00.000Z	billy		should i be able to find the file /etc/udev/rules.d/z25_persistent-net.rules in ubuntu?
2007-12-29T19:37:00.000Z	billy		is there an equivalent for ubuntu? im a linux noob,
2007-12-29T19:38:00.000Z	wols_	billy	you should, but what are you trying to do
2007-12-29T19:38:00.000Z	billy	wols_	i do wlanconfig to create an ath0 in monitor mode (after destroying it first) but it creates ath1 instead
2007-12-29T19:39:00.000Z	wols_	billy	it's in the same directory /etc/udev/rules.d/  only the numbering is wrong iirc
2007-12-29T19:40:00.000Z	billy	wols_	 there is a persistent-net-rules generator, for not a persistent-net-rules
2007-12-29T19:43:00.000Z	wols_	billy	delete ghe generator and this udev foolishness with interfaces ends
