2006-10-05T16:06:00.000Z	ashzilla		wicked, I haven't
2006-10-05T16:06:00.000Z	ashzilla		but I cannot go to sleep until I resolve this, I must fix it for work
2006-10-05T16:07:00.000Z	ashzilla		no
2006-10-05T16:07:00.000Z	ashzilla		I can't get that far
2006-10-05T16:07:00.000Z	ashzilla		I'm on my roommates PC
2006-10-05T16:08:00.000Z	ashzilla		I know the CD drive works
2006-10-05T16:08:00.000Z	ashzilla		It reads the windows cd perfectly
2006-10-05T16:09:00.000Z	ashzilla		nothing
2006-10-05T16:09:00.000Z	ashzilla		nowhere
2006-10-05T16:09:00.000Z	ashzilla		not even the ... when it starts to get read
2006-10-05T16:09:00.000Z	kemik	ashzilla	try another CD-r brand, and burn them in another CDRW
2006-10-05T16:09:00.000Z	ashzilla	kemik	I did ;)
2006-10-05T16:09:00.000Z	kemik	ashzilla	ok.. then getting ubuntu to work isnt worth the headache ;)
2006-10-05T16:10:00.000Z	ashzilla	kemik	could you recommend something to fix my drive
2006-10-05T16:10:00.000Z	kemik	ashzilla	nope.. i got debian working on my laptop, however ubuntu and vector linux is a "no-go"
2006-10-05T16:11:00.000Z	kemik	ashzilla	is your CD-drive faulty, or the HD ?
2006-10-05T16:11:00.000Z	ashzilla	kemik	It's a mysstery
2006-10-05T16:12:00.000Z	kemik	ashzilla	my bet is the CD drive is faulty... and it's luck that let you boot the windows cd so far
2006-10-05T16:13:00.000Z	kemik	ashzilla	but it sounds like it's either a) cd drive. or b) hd
2006-10-05T16:14:00.000Z	kemik	ashzilla	im guessing (still) that your CD-rom is broken
2006-10-05T16:17:00.000Z	kemik	ashzilla	i've tried to tell you this 3 times already ! :P
2006-10-05T16:26:00.000Z	kemik	ashzilla	try the CD disc in your friends computer.. that way youll know if it's the DISC or the DRIVE
