2008-09-09T09:16:00.000Z	zacha		I'm trying to get my swap file on my swap partition... I'm using a howto. It said "dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile1 bs=1024 count=524288" would create it but I don't know where it has gone?
2008-09-09T09:18:00.000Z	zacha		free -m "Swap:            0          0          0" >:o
2008-09-09T09:19:00.000Z	danbhfive	zacha	hey, I have the same problem!!!
2008-09-09T09:20:00.000Z	zacha	danbhfive	What are you trying to do?
2008-09-09T09:21:00.000Z	danbhfive	zacha	you mean, how am I going to fix it?
2008-09-09T09:21:00.000Z	zacha	danbhfive	yeah that as well. I wanted to get it working in the first place so I could hibernate
2008-09-09T09:22:00.000Z	danbhfive	zacha	do you have multiple OSs installed?  like 2 ubuntus?
2008-09-09T09:22:00.000Z	zacha	danbhfive	Windows + Ubuntu
2008-09-09T09:23:00.000Z	danbhfive	zacha	well, try sudo swapon -a       see if you get any errors
2008-09-09T09:23:00.000Z	zacha	danbhfive	Where abouts?
2008-09-09T09:24:00.000Z	danbhfive	zacha	on a terminal, the same place you ran free
2008-09-09T09:24:00.000Z	zacha	danbhfive	I'm lost. I don't know where the swap file is going when I create it with  dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile1
2008-09-09T09:25:00.000Z	zacha	danbhfive	nothing happens when I try swapon -a
2008-09-09T09:25:00.000Z	danbhfive	zacha	oh, you are using a swap file, sorry cant help!   try asking ubottu for help, with !swap
2008-09-09T09:25:00.000Z	zacha	danbhfive	what were you thinking?
2008-09-09T09:25:00.000Z	danbhfive	zacha	that you were using a swap partition
2008-09-09T09:26:00.000Z	zacha	danbhfive	I thought I needed to have a swap partition to hibernate and that the swap file would be on that partition. Linux doesn't seem to be using that partition
2008-09-09T09:27:00.000Z	danbhfive	zacha	no, if you have a swap partition, then linux just used the whole partition, no files needed.  Using a swap file would be creating a file on your regular partition, and using that file for swap space
2008-09-09T09:29:00.000Z	zacha	danbhfive	ok. So how do I delete the file I created and get uswsusp to use that swap partition?
2008-09-09T09:30:00.000Z	danbhfive	zacha	can you pastebin sudo fdisk -l        and ls -al /dev/disk/bu-uuid/           and the contents of /etc/fstab
2008-09-09T09:31:00.000Z	danbhfive	zacha	woops, its ls -al /dev/disk/by-uuid/
