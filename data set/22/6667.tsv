2007-06-18T14:59:00.000Z	cdavis		what command can I use to find out what packge provides glibc.h ?
2007-06-18T15:00:00.000Z	jrib	cdavis	apt-file or packages.ubuntu.com
2008-06-21T18:57:00.000Z	jrib	cdavis	try: /join #mysql
2008-09-28T19:00:00.000Z	jrib	cdavis	I use esmtp for an MTA and procmail for an MDA
2011-10-14T01:34:00.000Z	jrib	cdavis	why are you not installing dependencies?  Dependencies exist for a reason, they aren't really optional
2011-10-14T01:35:00.000Z	cdavis	jrib	I am getting vmware client to work with pcoip. It works fine, the dependencies are for things like usb redirection which I don't need
2011-10-14T01:35:00.000Z	jrib	cdavis	then rebuild the package without those dependencies
2011-10-14T01:35:00.000Z	cdavis	jrib	ok. don't know how but I will try to figure it out
2011-10-14T01:36:00.000Z	jrib	cdavis	why don't you just install the dependencies in that case?
2011-10-14T01:36:00.000Z	cdavis	jrib	The conflict with things already installed. like it wants its own rdesktop client
2011-10-14T01:37:00.000Z	jrib	cdavis	then your best bet is to rebuild the package. Grab the source package and rebuild.  See ubottu
2011-10-14T01:41:00.000Z	cdavis	jrib	the source ins't available :( from HP's site. Maybe I will try to install grab the binaries the remove the .deb
2011-10-14T01:42:00.000Z	jrib	cdavis	that's probably the best thing to do.  The other alternative is to use the "equivs" package to create a fake package for the dependencies and install that, but I would not recommend this as it just clutters your install
2012-06-21T15:57:00.000Z	jrib	cdavis	no spaces around =
2012-06-21T15:57:00.000Z	jrib	cdavis	also no $
2012-06-21T15:58:00.000Z	jrib	cdavis	$BLAH should be BLAH
2012-10-18T03:37:00.000Z	jrib	cdavis	when it's ready
2012-10-18T03:40:00.000Z	cdavis	jrib	Are you trying to be nasty or sincere?
2012-10-18T03:40:00.000Z	jrib	cdavis	serious
2012-10-18T03:40:00.000Z	cdavis	jrib	ok, thanks
2012-10-18T03:40:00.000Z	jrib	cdavis	there's never been a fixed release time.  Afaik, that's still true for tomorrow
2012-10-18T03:41:00.000Z	cdavis	jrib	k, I am hoping to get up early and start the download before heading for work
