2005-09-29T13:02:00.000Z	denn^^		hi. anyone know what causes debootstrat error on install?
2005-09-29T13:03:00.000Z	bob2	denn^^	usually means a broken CD
2005-09-29T13:05:00.000Z	bob2	denn^^	er, did you check if any of them burnt correctly?
2005-09-29T13:06:00.000Z	denn^^	bob2	how do you check?
2005-09-29T13:07:00.000Z	bob2	denn^^	boot into expert mode and select "verify cd" from the menu
2005-09-29T13:07:00.000Z	denn^^	bob2	i just burned the isos with alcohol
2005-09-29T13:20:00.000Z	denn^^	bob2	some bsd file on disc was corrupted
2005-09-29T13:20:00.000Z	denn^^	bob2	what's the right way to burn ubuntu?
2005-09-29T13:21:00.000Z	bob2	denn^^	try it at a slower speed
2005-09-29T13:22:00.000Z	denn^^	bob2	i did it at 4x
2005-09-29T13:22:00.000Z	bob2	denn^^	maybe your burner is broken; try 1x and go make dinner, maybe
2005-09-29T13:23:00.000Z	denn^^	bob2	i'm reading some google stuff and that problem occurs even on shipped cds
2005-09-29T13:26:00.000Z	bob2	denn^^	yes, some shipped cds are damaged
2005-09-29T13:26:00.000Z	bob2	denn^^	they are not useful, tho, and should be returned (iirc)
2005-09-29T13:26:00.000Z	bob2	denn^^	if your cd burner is unable to burn it correctly, it's an issue with your burner or media, not a problem wwith the ubuntu iso
2005-09-29T13:29:00.000Z	bob2	denn^^	did you check that it downloaded correctly?
2005-09-29T13:31:00.000Z	bob2	denn^^	on windows? download md5sum.exe
2005-09-29T13:34:00.000Z	denn^^	bob2	this is the md5 i got from my file f6b3f164c99761234858a4d2c12d0840
2005-09-29T13:34:00.000Z	denn^^	bob2	on my ubuntu-5.04-install-i386.iso
2005-09-29T13:34:00.000Z	bob2	denn^^	and is that the same as in MD5SUMS?
2005-09-29T13:35:00.000Z	denn^^	bob2	i can't find the original md5
2005-09-29T13:35:00.000Z	bob2	denn^^	yes you can
