2012-05-06T22:13:00.000Z	Areckx		I am trying to install windows xp. My current partition is 140 GB and it is the only partition, ext4. What I want to do is RESIZE the partition WITHOUT doing a complete reinstall. I want to install Windows XP on a new partition that is taken from part of the ext4 partition, thus creating an NTFS partition. There is currently a linux swap partition on /dev/sda5 and an Uncategorized partition.
2012-05-06T22:14:00.000Z	Areckx		What documentation would you recommend I read in order to do this?
2012-05-06T22:15:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	gparted to the rescue!
2012-05-06T22:15:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	from a livecd?
2012-05-06T22:16:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	you can't resize a partition that is in use, hence the need for a livecd
2012-05-06T22:17:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	a usb would do the trick too
2012-05-06T22:18:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	i'd need to see your partition layout and what you want
2012-05-06T22:18:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	screenshots are glorious!
2012-05-06T22:20:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	wow, that will be easy
2012-05-06T22:21:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	resize sda1 and add a new partition
2012-05-06T22:21:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	you are on it, you need to use a livecd
2012-05-06T22:22:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	indeed, if all you want is another partition
2012-05-06T22:23:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	so you don't have an xp cd? you want to do it via usb?
2012-05-06T22:25:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	not sure sorry
2012-05-06T22:30:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	awesome, have fun
2012-05-06T22:31:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	wow works in wine apparently
2012-05-06T23:16:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	mention in #winehq what version you are using and see if a more recent wine would be better
2012-05-06T23:17:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	are you using compiz?
2012-05-06T23:17:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	compiz fusion, fancy desktop effects
2012-05-06T23:19:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	wine doesn't work well with compiz
2012-05-06T23:19:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	it is in the #winehq topic
2012-05-06T23:19:00.000Z	OpenBSDT40	Areckx	no, just use metacity instead
