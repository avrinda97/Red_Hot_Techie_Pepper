2011-12-24T11:59:00.000Z	DrDamnit		Connected my box to a Samsung TV. Samsung resolution is 1920x1080. I set the nVidia driver settings to auto detect and it recognizes the TV and the resolution; however, the X desktop is about 5% too big for the screen so I cannot see the top or bottom bars. How do i fix this?
2011-12-24T12:01:00.000Z	almoxarife	DrDamnit	in the user settings for nvidia you will find the correction slider for it, I think its in the 'tv' tab
2011-12-24T12:02:00.000Z	almoxarife	DrDamnit	xvidia setting? nice gui? fixes it
2011-12-24T12:16:00.000Z	almoxarife	DrDamnit	I suggested nvidia configuration app, nice gui that lets you fix the over-scan
2011-12-24T12:17:00.000Z	DrDamnit	almoxarife	I cannot find the "slider". Where should I be looking? What would it be named?
2011-12-24T12:17:00.000Z	almoxarife	DrDamnit	is the app open?
2011-12-24T12:18:00.000Z	almoxarife	DrDamnit	left side, lots of options, near bottom, something about the tv?
2011-12-24T12:19:00.000Z	almoxarife	DrDamnit	stop clicking on shit
2011-12-24T12:20:00.000Z	almoxarife	DrDamnit	cool, it opens another options list, yes?
2011-12-24T12:20:00.000Z	almoxarife	DrDamnit	second to last option is what?
2011-12-24T12:23:00.000Z	almoxarife	DrDamnit	http://www.ypass.net/blog/2010/04/nvidia-overscan-correction-fixed-in-latest-drivers/ <-- find that option
2011-12-24T12:25:00.000Z	DrDamnit	almoxarife	I just found that too. (I didn't know it was called overscan, which was vital to my Google Fu skills. )Which option on there do you recommend?
2011-12-24T12:25:00.000Z	almoxarife	DrDamnit	THE CIRCLED ONE!
2011-12-24T12:27:00.000Z	almoxarife	DrDamnit	using nvidia-current?
2011-12-24T12:28:00.000Z	DrDamnit	almoxarife	yes.
2011-12-24T12:29:00.000Z	almoxarife	DrDamnit	you have 'nvidia-current' installed, and don't see the slider, that's a mystery then
2011-12-24T12:34:00.000Z	almoxarife	DrDamnit	wait, its there, its hidden, can you move the window up?
2011-12-24T12:43:00.000Z	almoxarife	DrDamnit	wait, its there, its hidden, can you move the window up?
2011-12-24T12:44:00.000Z	DrDamnit	almoxarife	I cannot move it. There is only one slider (vibrance) and then Detect EDID is below that. Expanding the window downwards reveals nothing. I think I just need the newest driver.
2011-12-24T12:45:00.000Z	DrDamnit	almoxarife	I take that back. I CAN move it, but it doesn't reveal anything new. :-(
2011-12-24T12:46:00.000Z	almoxarife	DrDamnit	that's really strange, you can see the bottom borders?
2011-12-24T12:47:00.000Z	DrDamnit	almoxarife	Yep. See all the borders. What's strange is that if I click on ANYTHING that has to do with the TV (that "SAMSUNG" panel), the app crashes.
