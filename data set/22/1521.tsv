2010-04-23T10:34:00.000Z	cage_raphel		hello..
2010-04-23T10:35:00.000Z	cage_raphel		i would like to know how i can view my ubuntu 9.1 grub menu as soon as i reboot my system.. i want my system to directly take me to the grub menu so that i can choose the other OS installed in my system. i tried giving ESC when the system boots.. but that does not take me to the Grub menu
2010-04-23T10:35:00.000Z	chris4585	cage_raphel	I believe you hold down shift in grub2
2010-04-23T10:36:00.000Z	chris4585	cage_raphel	try holding down shift right after bios loads
2010-04-23T10:42:00.000Z	cage_raphel	chris4585	that worked.. i was able to access the GRUB menu by tapping the shift key when my system reboots!
2010-04-23T10:42:00.000Z	chris4585	cage_raphel	glad it worked :)
2010-04-23T10:44:00.000Z	chris4585	cage_raphel	I think you have to login to ubuntu and run grub-pc ?
2010-04-23T10:44:00.000Z	cage_raphel	chris4585	i am pretty new to ubuntu .. could u pls walk me thro as to how to run the grub-pc?
2010-04-23T10:45:00.000Z	chris4585	cage_raphel	ok hold on let me find something
2010-04-23T10:45:00.000Z	cage_raphel	chris4585	sure thing .. pls take your time. you are doing a great job! :)

2010-04-23T10:49:00.000Z	cage_raphel	chris4585	thanks for that info again .. but i have no clue how to update the menu.lst. would u like to take a look at my menu.lst file?
2010-04-23T10:49:00.000Z	chris4585	cage_raphel	first, are you booted into ubuntu?
2010-04-23T10:50:00.000Z	cage_raphel	chris4585	yes i am on ubuntu now
2010-04-23T10:50:00.000Z	cage_raphel	chris4585	if i am not wrong .. this is the command to access the menu.lst..... sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst . is that the correct one ?
2010-04-23T10:51:00.000Z	chris4585	cage_raphel	open a terminal by going to Applications > Accessories > Terminal then type sudo update-grub
2010-04-23T10:51:00.000Z	chris4585	cage_raphel	that does look like the right command, but you don't have to do it manually I think
2010-04-23T10:51:00.000Z	cage_raphel	chris4585	 ok .. done.
2010-04-23T10:52:00.000Z	cage_raphel	chris4585	would u like to see the output of what i have got here after running the command?
2010-04-23T10:53:00.000Z	chris4585	cage_raphel	in the output does it mention anything about opensolaris?
2010-04-23T10:54:00.000Z	cage_raphel	chris4585	no.. no such thing is mentioned.. i would appreciate if you can quickly go thro this output. shall i send the output to u in a private chat.. looks like i cant paste here.
2010-04-23T10:54:00.000Z	chris4585	cage_raphel	sure
