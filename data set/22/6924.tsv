2010-08-04T18:23:00.000Z	StuckMojo		where do you go to get kbuntu and such? or are they on the alternative cd?
2010-08-04T18:23:00.000Z	jrib	StuckMojo	kubuntu.org?
2010-08-04T18:25:00.000Z	jrib	StuckMojo	kubuntu-desktop
2010-08-04T18:25:00.000Z	jrib	StuckMojo	yeah, then you'll have an option to choose your environment at the login screen
2010-08-04T18:25:00.000Z	jrib	StuckMojo	well if you don't want gnome, but only kde...
2010-08-04T18:26:00.000Z	StuckMojo	jrib	i'm quite familiar with debian/ubuntu, but i've never actually tried the full kde desktop
2010-08-04T18:31:00.000Z	jrib	StuckMojo	it's in the forum thread, linked by someone else
2010-08-04T18:32:00.000Z	StuckMojo	jrib	yeah just followed it
2010-08-04T18:34:00.000Z	StuckMojo	jrib	?
2010-08-04T18:35:00.000Z	jrib	StuckMojo	yes, and he can just pass --build to apt-get too
2010-08-04T18:38:00.000Z	jrib	StuckMojo	do you know if that pulls in build-dups automatically?
2010-08-04T18:38:00.000Z	StuckMojo	jrib	not sure
2010-08-04T19:01:00.000Z	StuckMojo	jrib	thx
2010-08-04T19:01:00.000Z	StuckMojo	jrib	you know, they really hide some stuff on the site
2010-08-04T19:01:00.000Z	StuckMojo	jrib	there's no obvious links to the mirrors list either
2010-08-04T19:01:00.000Z	jrib	StuckMojo	usually the mirrors have a file called MD5SUMS (or similar) together with all the isos, but yes I don't think they are very easily found on ubuntu.com
2010-10-14T16:17:00.000Z	jrib	StuckMojo	yes
2011-02-10T20:20:00.000Z	StuckMojo	jrib	thx
2011-02-10T20:20:00.000Z	jrib	StuckMojo	my guess is "spinfinity", but explore the results of: apt-cache search -n plymouth
2011-02-10T20:21:00.000Z	StuckMojo	jrib	yeah thanks ;)
2011-02-10T20:23:00.000Z	StuckMojo	jrib	hmm...i don't think that's it ;) maybe it's a custom one
2011-02-10T20:23:00.000Z	jrib	StuckMojo	maybe
