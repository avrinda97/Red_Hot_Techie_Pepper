2008-01-19T04:21:00.000Z	DRebellion	eek	what exactly are you trying to do?
2008-01-19T04:23:00.000Z	eek	DRebellion	lol well now i'm trying to get azureus to run on my server.  i can start it via ssh but it not working cause it doesn't use the ports & when using Ampache it wont use port 80 so i can acsess it where ever
2008-01-19T04:23:00.000Z	DRebellion	eek	are you trying to use the azureus web interface?
2008-01-19T04:24:00.000Z	DRebellion	eek	i don't understand the problem/what you're trying to do
2008-01-19T04:26:00.000Z	eek	DRebellion	ok so i got Azureus running on my sever via my lab, but it wont track/seed/download cause i got a NAT issue do to lack of port recog.
2008-01-19T04:26:00.000Z	DRebellion	eek	so, set up port forwarding on your router?
2008-01-19T04:26:00.000Z	eek	DRebellion	maybe i got some jargon wrong  .   yes!!
2008-01-19T04:27:00.000Z	eek	DRebellion	 btw how do i get your name to highlight when i want you to notice   cant remember that syntax
2008-01-19T04:28:00.000Z	DRebellion	eek	just mention my name, and my client will alert me :P
2008-01-19T04:29:00.000Z	eek	DRebellion	cool  so yeah my router is opened to the ports i want but the server wont use them? wtf?
2008-01-19T04:29:00.000Z	eek	DRebellion	both udp and the other lol
2008-01-19T04:29:00.000Z	DRebellion	eek	when someone connects from outside, the router will forward their messages to your sever. your server doesn't have to do any extra work
2008-01-19T04:31:00.000Z	eek	DRebellion	yeah but when i try to conntact it w/ the web interface for  ampache or use Azureus i get port problems?  but not on the  machine i'm on now?
2008-01-19T04:31:00.000Z	DRebellion	eek	i don't know hwat the problem could be
2008-01-19T04:41:00.000Z	eek	DRebellion	thank you for your wisdom.  my noob cup not yet over flowith
