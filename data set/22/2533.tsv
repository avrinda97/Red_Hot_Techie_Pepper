2009-05-20T08:43:00.000Z	usr13	g0wda	move the 12G partition to the end of the drive.
2009-05-20T08:43:00.000Z	g0wda	usr13	ok... newie me :( how do i do that now?
2009-05-20T08:46:00.000Z	usr13	g0wda	 gparted
2009-05-20T08:47:00.000Z	usr13	g0wda	yes
2009-05-20T08:47:00.000Z	usr13	g0wda	Do as storbeck says
2009-05-20T08:52:00.000Z	usr13	g0wda	Unmount the filesystem first.
2009-05-20T09:45:00.000Z	usr13	g0wda	shouldn't matter about the swap partition.
2009-05-20T09:45:00.000Z	usr13	g0wda	YOu can try swapoff
2009-05-23T10:44:00.000Z	usr13	g0wda	User isolation / restrictions is a good thing / an important thing.  Borrowing root priviledges is also a good thing.
2009-05-23T10:45:00.000Z	usr13	g0wda	It is best to work within these boundries.  And it works quite well too.
2009-05-23T10:46:00.000Z	usr13	g0wda	Only if you give her permission to do so.
2009-05-23T10:46:00.000Z	usr13	g0wda	By default, she will not have those permissions.
2009-05-23T10:47:00.000Z	usr13	g0wda	As lstarnes says, you can add her to admin group but she won't be by default.
2009-05-23T10:49:00.000Z	usr13	g0wda	if you just want to look:  cat /etc/group  or  less /etc/group
2009-05-23T10:50:00.000Z	usr13	g0wda	That is the default behaviour.
