2008-07-30T02:55:00.000Z	n1zjd_		okay im about tired of this....im the computer owner and I do love ubuntu dont get me wrong....the other day I tried to edit index.html for the apache server....wouldnt let me....I know I can do it using sudo....but can I change permissions so this doesnt happen anymore??
2008-07-30T02:56:00.000Z	n1zjd_		do I need to do that with every file I want to access?
2008-07-30T02:56:00.000Z	n1zjd_		its not just apache...I could care less about apache
2008-07-30T02:57:00.000Z	n1zjd_		but I tried to move a file from my desktop to /usr/share and get denied
2008-07-30T02:57:00.000Z	n1zjd_		again sorry I mentioned apache...had nothing to do with apache specifically....
2008-07-30T02:58:00.000Z	n1zjd_		I want to be able to move a file to anywhere on the system I want to
2008-07-30T02:58:00.000Z	n1zjd_		and what reason is that?
2008-07-30T02:58:00.000Z	n1zjd_		to save yourself from yourself?
2008-07-30T02:59:00.000Z	n1zjd_		I'm well aware of sudo...I just thought there might be a better way
2008-07-30T03:00:00.000Z	histo	n1zjd_	just add your user to that group and you will have access to edit the html files
2008-07-30T02:56:00.000Z	histo	n1zjd_	chmod
2008-07-30T02:57:00.000Z	histo	n1zjd_	you probably want to create a www group and add your user to it.  Someone else on here might know the "best" way
2008-07-30T02:58:00.000Z	histo	n1zjd_	you can't unless you are root.
2008-07-30T02:58:00.000Z	histo	n1zjd_	there is a reason for that.
2008-07-30T02:58:00.000Z	histo	n1zjd_	so you don't bork your system editing files by accident etc...
2008-07-30T03:00:00.000Z	histo	n1zjd_	who is the group that owns www?
2008-07-30T03:01:00.000Z	histo	n1zjd_	well you chgrp them to www and add your user to that.  I thought there was an apache group to add your user to.
2008-07-30T03:01:00.000Z	histo	n1zjd_	don't do what binarydragon said
2008-07-30T03:03:00.000Z	histo	n1zjd_	just change the permissions for index.html
2008-07-30T03:05:00.000Z	histo	n1zjd_	linux permissions take a little getting use to.  Once you understand why they are the way they are it will all make sense.
2008-07-30T03:07:00.000Z	histo	n1zjd_	it is trust me.
2008-07-30T03:08:00.000Z	histo	n1zjd_	no viruses addware etc...
