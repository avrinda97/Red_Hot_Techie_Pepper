2011-11-29T19:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	Alinn	 you have tried the fglrx drivers from the ubuntu repos first? assuming you are trying to get them going. :)
2011-11-29T19:24:00.000Z	dr_willis		you were able to access the shares befor install ing samba? odd...
2011-11-29T19:24:00.000Z	dr_willis		after installing samba they now show up in gvfs?
2011-11-29T19:24:00.000Z	dr_willis		cant say ive ever noticed that befor. could be the file manager has 2 modes of accessing the shares.
2011-11-29T19:24:00.000Z	dr_willis		but i always install samba. :)
2011-11-29T19:25:00.000Z	dr_willis		like in the top 10 things i do on a new install.
2011-11-29T19:25:00.000Z	dr_willis		!info smbfs
2011-11-29T19:25:00.000Z	Alinn	dr_willis	When i activated it in "additional Driver" some letters and icons in my desktop vanish.
2011-11-29T19:25:00.000Z	Alinn	dr_willis	i have mint 12
2011-11-29T19:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	Alinn	 just some letters? like the letter 'e' ? ie:::   letters becomes 'l tt rs' ?
2011-11-29T19:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	Alinn	 you should be asking for help in the mint channels then.
2011-11-29T19:27:00.000Z	Alinn	dr_willis	exactly..
2011-11-29T19:27:00.000Z	dr_willis		bbl. gotta do some more snow storm-a-comming-prep. :)

2011-11-29T19:32:00.000Z	Alinn	dr_willis	Which item is my graphic card? "Desktop Graphics" or "integrated Motherboard Graphics" or "Embedded Graphics" ?
2011-11-29T19:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	Alinn	 those terms all basically mean the same to me... try #2 and see what it says,, i guess..
2011-11-29T19:39:00.000Z	Alinn	dr_willis	#2? integrated Motherboard Graphics?
2011-11-29T19:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	Alinn	 sure why not.. flip a coin.. try it allready...
2011-11-29T19:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	Alinn	 linux drivers are based on the chipset.. not where its attatched
2011-11-29T19:41:00.000Z	Alinn	dr_willis	Thanks a lot:)
