2007-12-16T21:18:00.000Z	ubuntino_	Blissex	ive pasted part of /var/log/messages: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/48452/
2007-12-16T21:27:00.000Z	Blissex	ubuntino_	your log shows several problems...
2007-12-16T21:27:00.000Z	Blissex	ubuntino_	apart from the permissions on the 'secrets' files...
2007-12-16T21:28:00.000Z	Blissex	ubuntino_	'Could not determine remote IP address: defaulting to 10.64.64.64' sounds worrying.
2007-12-16T21:28:00.000Z	ubuntino_	Blissex	i've unchecked that
2007-12-16T21:28:00.000Z	Blissex	ubuntino_	and replacing the default route is not a good idea usually.
2007-12-16T21:29:00.000Z	ubuntino_	Blissex	should i remove the app and try connecting through network-manager?
2007-12-16T21:29:00.000Z	Blissex	ubuntino_	also your firewall seemss to be blocking traffic to/from the PPP0 interface.
2007-12-16T21:30:00.000Z	ubuntino_	Blissex	i running gnome. no firewall installed. what firewall do you recommend?
2007-12-16T21:32:00.000Z	ubuntino_	Blissex	ubotu: actually, firestarter (i forgot)
2007-12-16T21:33:00.000Z	ubuntino_	Blissex	after disabling firestarter, got the web (firefox) working. Any hints on how to solve those "holes"?
2007-12-16T21:37:00.000Z	Blissex	ubuntino_	there are lots of apps that setup a PPP connection. I personally configure it manually, so I don't know which one is likely to work best for you. For some time in the past I used 'wvdial', which
2007-12-16T21:39:00.000Z	ubuntino_	Blissex	what files do i have to check to get my connection secure? That 10.64.64.64 issue...
2007-12-16T21:41:00.000Z	Blissex	ubuntino_	try running 'pppd' with the 'debug; option to see why the other side is not sending its address.
2007-12-16T21:42:00.000Z	ubuntino_	Blissex	ok. Thanks. Ill check the ip on windowse config
2007-12-16T21:43:00.000Z	ubuntino_	Blissex	one more question. It seems ubuntu is recnogizing my sata drive with errors and using it as an ide drive. is that so?
2007-12-16T21:48:00.000Z	Blissex	ubuntino_	more likely it is a PATA drive where SATA=-PATA is not owrking.
2007-12-16T21:48:00.000Z	Blissex	ubuntino_	it is more or less impossible for a SATA drive to be handled by a PATA driver.
2007-12-16T21:49:00.000Z	ubuntino_	Blissex	its a asus laptop with a sata drive(so they say) do i have to install anything?
2007-12-16T21:50:00.000Z	Blissex	ubuntino_	if the SATA chipset is not very recent porobably you don't have to install anything.
2007-12-16T21:50:00.000Z	Blissex	ubuntino_	google the error messages you get.
2007-12-16T21:51:00.000Z	ubuntino_	Blissex	Thanks
