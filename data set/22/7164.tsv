2006-05-27T09:48:00.000Z	bakura82		Okay, so back to my first question.
2006-05-27T09:49:00.000Z	bakura82		QUESTION:  Is there a line-by-line command in linux/ubuntu so I can see the installtion step by tspe?
2006-05-27T09:49:00.000Z	bakura82		step*
2006-05-27T09:49:00.000Z	bakura82		Heath:" later
2006-05-27T09:49:00.000Z	bakura82		installation
2006-05-27T09:51:00.000Z	bakura82		*sighs*  I guess the Ubuntu distro was just not for me.  Anyone suggest any other distros?  I have usually always used RedHat/Fedora but I wanted to just try something different
2006-05-27T09:52:00.000Z	rob	bakura82	you want to see the installation step by step?
2006-05-27T09:52:00.000Z	rob	bakura82	just do an expert install
2006-05-27T09:52:00.000Z	bakura82	rob	yes.
2006-05-27T09:53:00.000Z	bakura82	rob	i get the same hang in expert mode unfortunately
2006-05-27T09:53:00.000Z	bakura82		and i can't even see what is causing it
2006-05-27T09:53:00.000Z	rob	bakura82	have you searched Malone, filed a bug?
2006-05-27T09:53:00.000Z	rob	bakura82	have you tried Dapper, using the live cd installer?
2006-05-27T09:54:00.000Z	bakura82	rob	well, dapper is beta right?  i wanted try what supposedly works
2006-05-27T09:54:00.000Z	rob	bakura82	Dapper pretty muchs works fine
2006-05-27T09:54:00.000Z	bakura82	rob	as or malone, well, i just had to google what the heck that was.  so, no, i haven't search it.  looking now.
2006-05-27T09:54:00.000Z	bakura82	rob	well, maybe i will try dapper....
2006-05-27T09:55:00.000Z	rob	bakura82	the live cd installer is very nice (needs some polish)
