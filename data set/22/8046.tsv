2009-12-18T04:23:00.000Z	MajorPayne		I want to open the file while it is still on the other computer.
2009-12-18T04:23:00.000Z	linxeh	MajorPayne	it should mount it somewhere, in /media maybe?
2009-12-18T04:23:00.000Z	linxeh	MajorPayne	try typing mount at the terminal - it should list all the mounted filesystems / servers
2009-12-18T04:24:00.000Z	linxeh	MajorPayne	try typing mount then
2009-12-18T04:24:00.000Z	linxeh	MajorPayne	just do it already
2009-12-18T04:25:00.000Z	MajorPayne	linxeh	Whops ^^
2009-12-18T04:25:00.000Z	linxeh	MajorPayne	type mount....
2009-12-18T04:26:00.000Z	linxeh	MajorPayne	please, type mount.
2009-12-18T04:27:00.000Z	MajorPayne	linxeh	Whops.  You are right.  It's under ~/.gvfs
2009-12-18T04:27:00.000Z	linxeh	MajorPayne	cool :-)
2009-12-18T04:27:00.000Z	linxeh	MajorPayne	no worries :)
2009-12-18T04:28:00.000Z	MajorPayne	linxeh	It goes and comes back.
2009-12-18T04:28:00.000Z	linxeh	MajorPayne	what kind of server is it ?
2009-12-18T04:29:00.000Z	MajorPayne	linxeh	It's a Debian server.
2009-12-18T04:29:00.000Z	linxeh	MajorPayne	I mean samba, nfs, etc ?
2009-12-18T04:30:00.000Z	MajorPayne	linxeh	Ohh, I mounted it via ssh.
2009-12-18T04:31:00.000Z	MajorPayne	linxeh	sftp.
2009-12-18T04:31:00.000Z	linxeh	MajorPayne	you could mount it via the command line, automount, or fstab then I guess
2009-12-18T04:31:00.000Z	MajorPayne	linxeh	I didn't think that worked over ssh.
2009-12-18T04:31:00.000Z	MajorPayne	linxeh	it it does, that would be ideal.
2009-12-18T04:36:00.000Z	MajorPayne	linxeh	Thanks for the help.  I should have though of mount myself.  I will look into either sshfs or NFS later.  This will do for now.  Bye.
2009-12-18T04:37:00.000Z	linxeh	MajorPayne	ok good luck - sshfs will work quite easily for you :)
