2009-08-24T21:08:00.000Z	ckill		I have ubuntu loaded on a 750GB 7200RPM drive.  I also have a 300GB 10000RPM drive in the machine and would like to move the entire OS over to it...any ideas?
2009-08-24T21:09:00.000Z	llutz	ckill	 use rsync/tar/cp or whatever you want to copy. configure fstab and grub after copying

2009-08-24T21:10:00.000Z	ckill	llutz	"configure fstab and grub after copying" this is what I need to understand better?  what do I need to do because the drive I am going to is actually smaller.
2009-08-24T21:11:00.000Z	llutz	ckill	 UUIDs will change and possibly partition-number
2009-08-24T21:11:00.000Z	llutz	ckill	 size doesn't matter
2009-08-24T21:12:00.000Z	ckill		Thats good to know thanks
2009-08-24T21:12:00.000Z	llutz	ckill	 you also will have to reinstall grub to partition or mbr of the new disk
2009-08-24T21:12:00.000Z	ckill		OK so how about grub do I use live cd to get that back...yes I knwo a noob
2009-08-24T21:13:00.000Z	llutz		!mbr |ckill
2009-08-24T21:13:00.000Z	llutz	ckill	 not sure but i guess you'll find needed info there ^^
2009-08-24T21:14:00.000Z	ckill		i appreciate this
2009-08-24T21:14:00.000Z	ckill		are yall familiar with mail servers? llutz
2009-08-24T21:15:00.000Z	llutz	ckill	 not really
2009-08-24T21:15:00.000Z	llutz	ckill	 but postfix is very good documented :)
2009-08-24T21:16:00.000Z	ckill		Thanks that is what I have set up now....I have new to this job and I am having to learn what is alreasy here...going backwards
2009-08-24T21:17:00.000Z	ckill		It just seems antiquated with no imap or HTML support
2009-08-24T21:17:00.000Z	llutz		webmin sucks
2009-08-24T21:18:00.000Z	ckill		I have webmin but i kinda breaks more than it fixes for me :?
2009-08-24T21:18:00.000Z	ckill		It is debian with no GUI right now.
2009-08-24T21:19:00.000Z	ckill		What about this guide?  http://flurdy.com/docs/postfix/
2009-08-24T21:19:00.000Z	llutz	ckill	 servers won't need a GUI, just an editor
