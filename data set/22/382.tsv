2012-03-21T22:35:00.000Z	AndyUbuntu		does anyone know how to install the latest version of gimp?
2012-03-21T22:35:00.000Z	KBentley57	AndyUbuntu	have you tried compiling it yourself?
2012-03-21T22:36:00.000Z	AndyUbuntu	KBentley57	i have not tried doing it myself
2012-03-21T22:36:00.000Z	KBentley57	AndyUbuntu	have you ever tried something like that before?
2012-03-21T22:36:00.000Z	AndyUbuntu	KBentley57	i have but not for a long time
2012-03-21T22:37:00.000Z	AndyUbuntu	KBentley57	is there a simple way to do that?
2012-03-21T22:37:00.000Z	KBentley57	AndyUbuntu	simple in theory i suppose, as long as you grab the current source, and all the dependencies are met
2012-03-21T22:38:00.000Z	AndyUbuntu	KBentley57	ok. Thats what I was worried about. As its not installing correctly through the repo will it be ok through source
2012-03-21T22:39:00.000Z	KBentley57	AndyUbuntu	have you tried to purge it via synaptic, and reinstall?
2012-03-21T22:42:00.000Z	AndyUbuntu	KBentley57	this is generally what i receive when i try to install http://pastebin.com/zqHxk9f2
2012-03-21T22:43:00.000Z	KBentley57	AndyUbuntu	that happens now, or after you purged the old install
2012-03-21T22:44:00.000Z	KBentley57	AndyUbuntu	from the command line run "sudo apt-get purge gimp" and see if it cleans up anything else
2012-03-21T22:45:00.000Z	KBentley57	AndyUbuntu	ok, and now you're trying to install gimp from cmd line, synaptic, or software center?
2012-03-21T22:48:00.000Z	KBentley57	AndyUbuntu	ok, and now you're trying to install gimp from cmd line, synaptic, or software center?
2012-03-21T22:51:00.000Z	AndyUbuntu	KBentley57	this is generally what i receive when i try to install http://pastebin.com/zqHxk9f2
2012-03-21T22:51:00.000Z	AndyUbuntu	KBentley57	sorry was installing it through software centre
2012-03-21T22:52:00.000Z	KBentley57	AndyUbuntu	have you tried installing those dependencies?
