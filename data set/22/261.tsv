2012-03-01T14:29:00.000Z	MacroMan		Anyone know the command to start the Network Connections gui as root/sudo?
2012-03-01T14:29:00.000Z	MacroMan		When I start the GUI as me (from the menu) it doesn't show my network connection
2012-03-01T14:30:00.000Z	MacroMan		I need to set a static IP, which is much easier from the GUI
2012-03-01T14:30:00.000Z	bluefrog	MacroMan	edit connections then
2012-03-01T14:31:00.000Z	MacroMan		I'm already connected via DHCP, but I can't see the connection to edit it
2012-03-01T14:31:00.000Z	MacroMan		So I assumed that I would be able to see it if I run the GUI as root
2012-03-01T14:32:00.000Z	bluefrog	MacroMan	right click on the network manager icon and choose edit connections
2012-03-01T14:32:00.000Z	MacroMan		Yes, done that. My connection doesn't show!
2012-03-01T14:32:00.000Z	MacroMan		Just an empty list
2012-03-01T14:32:00.000Z	MacroMan		But I am online, chatting here right now
2012-03-01T14:33:00.000Z	bluefrog	MacroMan	what is written in /etc/network/interfaces ?
2012-03-01T14:34:00.000Z	MacroMan		http://pastebin.com/vgqL87v2
2012-03-01T14:35:00.000Z	MacroMan		I haven't made any changes. New computer 2 months ago and I've never edited the network settings. I just plugged the ethernet cable in when I first switched it on and it worked fine
2012-03-01T14:35:00.000Z	bluefrog	MacroMan	http://pastebin.com/3q0Gu2dA
2012-03-01T14:36:00.000Z	bluefrog	MacroMan	and if you dind't play with connections, someone did for you...
2012-03-01T14:36:00.000Z	MacroMan	bluefrog	won't that knock out my connection?
2012-03-01T14:37:00.000Z	MacroMan		No, I installed Ubunutu on this machine myself. The only thing network related I edited was the iptables
2012-03-01T14:37:00.000Z	bluefrog	MacroMan	it shouldn't but then your network-manager should take care of everything
2012-03-01T14:37:00.000Z	MacroMan	bluefrog	so my network manager will restore the correct settings?
2012-03-01T14:38:00.000Z	bluefrog	MacroMan	no. it will just manage eth0 which it doesn't do right now
2012-03-01T14:38:00.000Z	MacroMan		ah ok thanks
2012-03-01T14:39:00.000Z	bluefrog	MacroMan	anyway from scratch  install  you only have the loopback device in that file
