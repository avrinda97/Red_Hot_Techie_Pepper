2008-08-26T10:10:00.000Z	bdunlap		gnea, don't you hate it when that happens? you think you may have found something but the server is down. i've had that issue recently.
2008-08-26T10:10:00.000Z	bdunlap		gnea, apparently the server is down or no longer a server
2008-08-26T10:11:00.000Z	SplashTK	bdunlap	nope tried several different apps, even system sounds have the static
