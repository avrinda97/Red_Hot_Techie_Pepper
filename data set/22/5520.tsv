2007-04-24T11:08:00.000Z	underwatercow		Can someone please help me with playing a DVD in ubuntu? I should be easy, and yet for some reason I cannot seem to get one to play correctly no matter what I do.
2007-04-24T11:08:00.000Z	fnf	underwatercow	plug your DVD into the drive, totem should appear and there you go.
2007-04-24T11:09:00.000Z	underwatercow	fnf	if only it were that easy
2007-04-24T11:09:00.000Z	fnf	underwatercow	what problems are you having ?
2007-04-24T11:09:00.000Z	underwatercow	fnf	Totem says it cannot play the DVD (I've tried two). I have also tried playing them in mplayer, VLC, Ogle... probably another I'm forgetting
2007-04-24T11:10:00.000Z	fnf	underwatercow	can you pastebin the exact message ?. Can you play the VOB files directly with totem/mplayer ?
2007-04-24T11:11:00.000Z	fnf	underwatercow	it should be that easy with a fresh Feisty installation.
2007-04-24T11:11:00.000Z	underwatercow	fnf	I did a fresh feisty...
2007-04-24T11:12:00.000Z	fnf	underwatercow	can you pastebin the exact message ?. Can you play the VOB files directly with totem/mplayer ?
2007-04-24T11:12:00.000Z	underwatercow	fnf	one sec
2007-04-24T11:12:00.000Z	underwatercow	fnf	what do you mean when you say pastebin?
2007-04-24T11:14:00.000Z	underwatercow	fnf	I'm trying to bring up the error again... it's sort of locking up
2007-04-24T11:15:00.000Z	underwatercow	fnf	or at least taking a while
2007-04-24T11:15:00.000Z	fnf	underwatercow	take your time.
2007-04-24T11:16:00.000Z	underwatercow	fnf	ok... got it
2007-04-24T11:16:00.000Z	underwatercow	fnf	if I try to start totem with the DVD in, it locks up and I have to force quit
2007-04-24T11:17:00.000Z	underwatercow	fnf	I have to start it, then put the DVD in and it says "An error occurred. Could not read from resource."
2007-04-24T11:17:00.000Z	fnf	underwatercow	can totem play the VOBs files ?
2007-04-24T11:17:00.000Z	underwatercow	fnf	will try that now
2007-04-24T11:18:00.000Z	underwatercow	fnf	I tried the VOB directly and same error
2007-04-24T11:18:00.000Z	underwatercow	fnf	on one of the players, it started to play the intro and crashed, but I forget which player
2007-04-24T11:19:00.000Z	fnf	underwatercow	no further suggestion, sorry, I've got no regioned-DVD at the moment.
