2009-02-20T18:15:00.000Z	nmlinuz		it seems that i don't have the libraries for  c++ : new.cpp:1:22: error: iostream.h: No such file or directory    what can i do?
2009-02-20T18:16:00.000Z	jrib	nmlinuz	have you installed build-essential?
2009-02-20T18:16:00.000Z	nmlinuz	jrib	i don't think so
2009-02-20T18:20:00.000Z	nmlinuz	jrib	i have just installed build-essentials and the problem continue
2009-02-20T18:20:00.000Z	jrib	nmlinuz	is new.cpp something you wrote?
2009-02-20T18:21:00.000Z	nmlinuz	jrib	yes...and it is all right
2009-02-20T18:22:00.000Z	jrib	nmlinuz	pastebin...
2009-02-20T18:24:00.000Z	nmlinuz	jrib	paste bin what? source code? error?
2009-02-20T18:24:00.000Z	jrib	nmlinuz	new.cpp
2009-02-20T18:25:00.000Z	nmlinuz	jrib	new.cpp has the hello world programm :)
2009-02-20T18:25:00.000Z	jrib	nmlinuz	yes, so pastebin it
2009-02-20T18:25:00.000Z	jrib	nmlinuz	and the command you run to compile (with errors)
2009-02-20T18:25:00.000Z	nmlinuz	jrib	http://pastebin.com/d472f8982
2009-02-20T18:26:00.000Z	nmlinuz	jrib	http://pastebin.com/d443c994f
2009-02-20T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	nmlinuz	"iostream", not "iostream.h"
2009-02-20T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	nmlinuz	and you need to do iostream::cout or whatever
2009-02-20T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	nmlinuz	erm sorry.  It's std::cout
2009-02-20T18:27:00.000Z	nmlinuz	jrib	but it is copy-paste from a site...anyway :)
2009-02-20T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	nmlinuz	the site is wrong
2009-02-20T18:27:00.000Z	nmlinuz	jrib	thank you
2009-02-20T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	nmlinuz	##c++ might point you to some good resources
2009-02-20T18:29:00.000Z	jrib	nmlinuz	in any case, you want to learn about "namespaces" in c++
