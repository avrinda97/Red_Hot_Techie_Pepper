2008-08-25T16:56:00.000Z	JMAC_17		so, who wants to help a windows power user who just bought a linux loaded laptop, then tried to install wicd and it broke network manager?
2008-08-25T16:56:00.000Z	JMAC_17		anybody...?
2008-08-25T16:57:00.000Z	JMAC_17		wicd is supposed to be a better network manager
2008-08-25T16:57:00.000Z	JMAC_17		but instead it didn't fully install after it uninstalled network manager
2008-08-25T16:58:00.000Z	JMAC_17		and i can't use synaptic because it can't connect to reinstall the network manager
2008-08-25T16:58:00.000Z	JMAC_17		now i'm dl'ing a ubuntu 8.04 cd and gonna try and reinstall network manager off of it
2008-08-25T16:58:00.000Z	JMAC_17		:'(
2008-08-25T16:58:00.000Z	defconner	JMAC_17	what about using apt?
2008-08-25T16:58:00.000Z	defconner	JMAC_17	yeah, pop open the terminal
2008-08-25T16:58:00.000Z	defconner	JMAC_17	apt-get install network-manager
2008-08-25T16:59:00.000Z	JMAC_17	defconner	open
2008-08-25T17:00:00.000Z	JMAC_17	defconner	& milligan_: terminal reads, E: could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock- open (13 permission denied)
2008-08-25T17:33:00.000Z	defconner	JMAC_17	 yes?
2008-08-25T17:34:00.000Z	JMAC_17	defconner	i found the network manager as a .tar.gz and extracted, how can i install it?
2008-08-25T17:34:00.000Z	defconner	JMAC_17	you probably want the .deb instead
2008-08-25T17:34:00.000Z	defconner	JMAC_17	then, dpkg -i file.dpkg
2008-08-25T17:35:00.000Z	defconner	JMAC_17	dpkg -i file.deb
2008-08-25T17:35:00.000Z	JMAC_17	defconner	not there, only diff.gz and .dsc
2008-08-25T17:35:00.000Z	defconner	JMAC_17	you're looking at the source package, you want the binary
