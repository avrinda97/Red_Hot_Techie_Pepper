2008-09-11T23:38:00.000Z	bonez46		if I have my router... and then put a hub behind it, on one of the lan ports...can I then plug other PC's into that hub.. and have them all network each other AND also have web/WAN access too?
2008-09-11T23:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	bonez46	yes if your router provides DHCP which most all do.
2009-03-26T08:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	bonez46	it might not be receiving any info from your video card or monitor or both
2009-03-26T08:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	bonez46	because your hardware may not be talking back to the quiries from the software.. I'll send you a link from ubottu that might help.
2009-03-26T08:22:00.000Z	bonez46	Scunizi	thanks. I guess there's no easy way.. it's a hack job.. right? Is there anything that will probe and discover the values I need to work into my xorg.conf?
2009-03-26T08:22:00.000Z	Scunizi	bonez46	what kind of video card do you have/
2009-03-26T08:23:00.000Z	bonez46	Scunizi	it's on the mobo.. via rhine.. with chrome 9 ..
2009-03-26T08:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	bonez46	hang on a sec.
2009-03-26T08:25:00.000Z	bonez46	Scunizi	I appreciate your help!
2009-03-26T08:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	bonez46	there are threads out there that talk about chrome 9 being difficult if not impossible.. there are two drivers listed in synaptic.  if only one is loaded you might try the other. check System>Admin>hardware drivers to see if you need to "enable" a driver there. there is a driver for chrome 9 in .rpm format. you might have to google for one in .deb format.  sorry beyond that I'm stumped..
2009-03-26T08:30:00.000Z	bonez46	Scunizi	thanks for the pointers..
2009-03-26T08:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	bonez46	typing xrandr in terminal will give you a list of "supported" resolutions.. randr controls video for the most part and is very flexable.. you can use it to list a new resolution and activate it.
2009-03-26T08:32:00.000Z	Scunizi	bonez46	then with the live cd check xorg and see what's listed for the driver.
2009-07-12T10:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	bonez46	with compiz running or in normal mode.
2009-07-12T10:10:00.000Z	bonez46	Scunizi	just normal mode.. I have to upgrade my video adapter before I can run compiz
2009-07-12T10:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	bonez46	to add more desktops then point at them and right mouse click, properties.. you'll see where to increase/decrease.  the mouse wheel will sometimes switch between desktops but also ctrl+alt+right or left arrow
2009-07-12T10:12:00.000Z	bonez46	Scunizi	thank  you
2009-07-12T10:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	bonez46	np. :)
2009-07-12T11:52:00.000Z	bonez46	Scunizi	hi again. hoping to get drivers installed for my system, I just switched monitors. and can't get anything higher than 800x600
2009-07-12T11:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	bonez46	ati or nvidia?
2009-07-12T11:52:00.000Z	bonez46	Scunizi	these are VIA Technologies..
2009-07-12T11:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	bonez46	via is beyond my experience.. chrome can be a pain in the ...... best to www.google.com/linux and search chrome 9 ubuntu
