2008-05-25T17:07:00.000Z	Treeh		Hello!
2008-05-25T17:08:00.000Z	Treeh		I've never written a script before...can someone help me write a basic startup script?
2008-05-25T17:10:00.000Z	Treeh		No one :(?
2008-05-25T17:10:00.000Z	penguin42	Treeh	What do you want to do in the script?
2008-05-25T17:11:00.000Z	Treeh	penguin42	I just want it to run at startup...three basic commads.
2008-05-25T17:11:00.000Z	Treeh	penguin42	sudo iwconfig wlan0 txpower on, sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid SMC, and sudo dhclient wlan0
2008-05-25T17:11:00.000Z	penguin42	Treeh	Try this one   http://www.freeos.com/guides/lsst/
2008-05-25T17:11:00.000Z	Treeh	penguin42	 ok
2008-05-25T17:11:00.000Z	Treeh	penguin42	 thanks
2008-05-25T17:12:00.000Z	penguin42	Treeh	However for that wireless stuff I'm betting there is some way to configure that in some of the wireless set up - but I just stick with real wires so don't know :-)
2008-05-25T17:13:00.000Z	Treeh	penguin42	I've tried everything..spent 5 hours on it yesterday...only thing that worked were those 3 commands.
2008-05-25T17:16:00.000Z	Treeh	penguin42	 I found someone who had a similar problem and I just edited the script...do you think this would work? : #!/bin/bash
2008-05-25T17:17:00.000Z	penguin42	Treeh	Yeh - you see scripts are simple; you need to do a chmod +x on the script but that's all you need to do
2008-05-25T17:17:00.000Z	Treeh	penguin42	I can't save the file in init.d...says I don't have the permission...any ideas why not?
2008-05-25T17:17:00.000Z	penguin42	Treeh	You don't have permissions!
2008-05-25T17:18:00.000Z	Treeh	penguin42	 but I'm the admin >.<
2008-05-25T17:18:00.000Z	penguin42	Treeh	You need to sudo to write in there - but DON'T - you don't want to put that shell script in there; you don't want to be doing things that sudo during boot
2008-05-25T17:18:00.000Z	Treeh	penguin42	why not :S?
2008-05-25T17:19:00.000Z	penguin42	Treeh	Sudo is really just for users to become priveliged
2008-05-25T17:19:00.000Z	Treeh	penguin42	 ok...but why shouldn't I put the script in there?
2008-05-25T17:20:00.000Z	penguin42	Treeh	init.d stuff is run during startup, you have to be a little more careful about stuff in there - well actually just putting a file in init.d won't make it get run so it's ok
2008-05-25T17:20:00.000Z	Treeh	penguin42	 Ok...but I want this script to run, at startup. How can I go about doing this without killing my computer xD?
