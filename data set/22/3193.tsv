2008-11-13T20:33:00.000Z	James_UK		i have XP installed on SATA, ubuntu and grub installed on IDE2Slave.... no matter what (hd1,0) etc i try windows will not boot from grub, can anyone help?
2008-11-13T20:34:00.000Z	James_UK		grub makes no distinction between sda and hda :/ this is where i get confused
2008-11-13T20:35:00.000Z	spree	James_UK	post your /boot/grub/grub.conf to pastebin.com so we can read it
2008-11-13T20:35:00.000Z	spree	James_UK	post your /boot/grub/menu.lst to pastebin.com so we can read it, sorry grub.conf is redhat
2008-11-13T20:36:00.000Z	James_UK	spree	just loading it now

2008-11-13T20:40:00.000Z	spree	James_UK	Well you're saying that Windows XP resides on the third hard drive, second partition
2008-11-13T20:40:00.000Z	James_UK	spree	well... i have been changing them from 0,0 to 1,0 to see if i can get it to boot... 2,1 was just the last place i left it saved
2008-11-13T20:41:00.000Z	spree	James_UK	where's it actually located
2008-11-13T20:41:00.000Z	spree	James_UK	this is computer arithmetic so 0 is 1, 1 is 2, etc
2008-11-13T20:42:00.000Z	James_UK	spree	XP is on the one and only SATA drive.... Ubuntu is on IDE2 Slave, but i also have another 2 IDE drives (storage only) plus one SCSI (storage) I just cant seem to locate the SATA to boot XP
2008-11-13T20:43:00.000Z	James_UK	spree	the only way i can get into XP is to change the boot order of my bios so that the SATA is first
2008-11-13T20:43:00.000Z	spree	James_UK	eliminating a more base-level problem, are you sure the HD is being detected by the BIOS?
2008-11-13T20:43:00.000Z	spree	James_UK	oh, okay
2008-11-13T20:44:00.000Z	James_UK	spree	the SATA hdd isnt detected as the drive alone... the boot option in bios is to boot from "bootable addin card" which is the SATA controller on teh motherboard
2008-11-13T20:46:00.000Z	spree	James_UK	knowing that, it's becoming more likely that we'll need to have the bootloader on your sata instead of your ide drive
2008-11-13T20:47:00.000Z	James_UK	spree	the only reason for me putting Grub on the ide with ubuntu was to keep the 2 OS completely seperate. That way if xp hdd dies i can still boot linux and visa versa
2008-11-13T20:49:00.000Z	spree	James_UK	sorry im not ignoring you
2008-11-13T20:49:00.000Z	James_UK	spree	no problem :)
2008-11-13T20:53:00.000Z	spree	James_UK	somebody's probably going to say OMG DONT DO IT ITS NOT UBUNTU but check out the GAG bootloader http://gag.sourceforge.net/  might be easier in your situation
2008-11-13T20:53:00.000Z	James_UK	spree	 thanx m8
2008-11-14T00:39:00.000Z	James_UK	spree	can i pm you ?
