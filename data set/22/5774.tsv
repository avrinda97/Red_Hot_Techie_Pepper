2007-02-28T06:11:00.000Z	lisapc		Spec ok thanks
2007-02-28T06:11:00.000Z	lisapc		Spec ok.  ill make 3 primary partitions from my 120gig HD. ty
2007-02-28T06:13:00.000Z	lisapc		Spec I have MS Vista installed on the first partition.  I now have 2 free primary partitions.  Can I install Ubuntu on my second partition now?  And will Ubuntu create a swap file partitions on that second partition?  or will Ubuntu have to use my 3rg Primary partition as swap patition?
2007-02-28T06:14:00.000Z	lisapc		Spec its too late now.  I cant make another partition as I reinstalled Vista on first and it took me 2 hours to set up
2007-02-28T06:15:00.000Z	lisapc		Spec so I cannot install Ubuntu now?
2007-02-28T06:15:00.000Z	lisapc		Spec yes, but wont that destroy my first partition and MS wdinwos?
2007-02-28T06:16:00.000Z	lisapc		Spec I had Vista oinstalled on first partition and then used gparted livecd to create a 3rd partiton from 2nd partition, and then Vista wouldnt boot anymore
2007-02-28T06:16:00.000Z	lisapc		Spec any ideas why?
2007-02-28T06:17:00.000Z	lisapc		Spec yeah :(  so I cant install Ubuntu without the rist of breaking first partition :(
2007-02-28T06:18:00.000Z	lisapc		is there a chance of installing Ubuntu on my 2nd partition without it breaking my first partition which contains my OS?
2007-02-28T06:20:00.000Z	sonicdevo	lisapc	I've resized with ubuntu and xp several times and the only problem I had was breaking the NT bootloader
2007-02-28T06:21:00.000Z	lisapc	sonicdevo	dont i need to resize to create a ubuntu swap partition?
2007-02-28T06:21:00.000Z	sonicdevo	lisapc	depends on how much free space you've got
2007-02-28T06:22:00.000Z	sonicdevo	lisapc	how big is your hdd, how much is used by windows?
2007-02-28T06:22:00.000Z	lisapc	sonicdevo	Vista sits on first part.  the second part is 20gig free and third is 40gig Free
2007-02-28T06:22:00.000Z	lisapc	sonicdevo	whats that got to do with anything?
2007-02-28T06:23:00.000Z	lisapc	sonicdevo	i dont think you understand.
2007-02-28T06:23:00.000Z	sonicdevo	lisapc	trying to figure out if you'll need to resize, and how much free space you've got to work with
2007-02-28T06:23:00.000Z	sonicdevo	lisapc	you may be right
2007-02-28T06:24:00.000Z	lisapc	sonicdevo	let me tell yuou again!  i have Vista on first pRTITION.  2nd and 3rd are free.  2nd is 20gig and 3rd is 40gig.  Can I install Ubuntu on 2nd partition without Ubuntu breaking my first partition?
2007-02-28T06:28:00.000Z	sonicdevo	lisapc	if your 2nd and 3rd partitions are empty, why don't you delete them, and then tell the installer to just use the free space
2007-02-28T06:28:00.000Z	lisapc	sonicdevo	because I want a partition to store IMAGE files
