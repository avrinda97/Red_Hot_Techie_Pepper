2004-12-21T12:20:00.000Z	broseman		Any hint's to my EPP problem? dmesg | parport0 lists "parport0: PC-style at 0x378, irq 7 [PCSPP,TRISTATE] " Nothing about EPP... :-(
2004-12-21T12:21:00.000Z	broseman		I meant dmesg | grep parport0
2004-12-21T12:22:00.000Z	broseman		Maybe one of you could do a dmesg | grep parport0 so that we can see, if it's a general ubuntu problem?
2004-12-21T12:23:00.000Z	paradoxmo	broseman	i have my parport working
2004-12-21T12:25:00.000Z	paradoxmo	broseman	parport is working for printer but not scanner?
2004-12-21T12:25:00.000Z	broseman	paradoxmo	correct
2004-12-21T12:27:00.000Z	paradoxmo	broseman	what does it say if you have the scanner plugged in on boot
2004-12-21T12:28:00.000Z	broseman	paradoxmo	the same! it is plugged in all the time
2004-12-21T12:28:00.000Z	paradoxmo	broseman	do you have both a brother printer and a scanner plugged in?
2004-12-21T12:29:00.000Z	broseman	paradoxmo	yes, both! the printer is plugged into the scanner
2004-12-21T12:29:00.000Z	broseman	paradoxmo	it works under fedora core 2
2004-12-21T12:29:00.000Z	broseman	paradoxmo	i tried this...
2004-12-21T12:30:00.000Z	paradoxmo	broseman	what happens when you try to access the scanner
2004-12-21T12:31:00.000Z	paradoxmo	broseman	how do you usually access the scanner, through sane?
2004-12-21T12:31:00.000Z	broseman	paradoxmo	xsane states, that it cannot find any devices
2004-12-21T12:32:00.000Z	paradoxmo	broseman	don't try that yet.
2004-12-21T12:34:00.000Z	broseman	paradoxmo	I will try this. Wait a minute. But I'm sure, that this have to do with the EPP mode. This is the only difference I could find between my Fedora and ubuntu installations in this matter. yes, i tried the ppdiag script. It also states, that I do not have the EPP mode activated.
2004-12-21T12:35:00.000Z	paradoxmo	broseman	what kernel are you using
2004-12-21T12:35:00.000Z	broseman	paradoxmo	do you have the EPP mode activated AND detected by ubuntu?
2004-12-21T12:36:00.000Z	paradoxmo	broseman	yes, i get: parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778), irq 7, dma 3 [PCSPP,TRISTATE,COMPAT,ECP,DMA] 
2004-12-21T12:39:00.000Z	paradoxmo	broseman	what does uname -a give you?
2004-12-21T12:41:00.000Z	broseman	paradoxmo	yeah, you are right... okay, thanks for your help!
