2008-09-24T16:01:00.000Z	joss	ikonia	i do not use ubuntu, but i like this kernel realease, well probrably
2008-09-24T16:01:00.000Z	ikonia	joss	sorry - this channel is for ubuntu support only
2008-09-24T16:01:00.000Z	joss	ikonia	have been thinking to switch to it though, several times
2008-09-24T16:01:00.000Z	ikonia	joss	get the kernel source from kernel.org

2008-09-24T16:03:00.000Z	joss	ikonia	you think that one ubuntu offers is also plain vanilla one?
2008-09-24T16:04:00.000Z	ikonia	joss	it has some ubuntu patches in but they are ment for ubuntu
2008-09-24T16:04:00.000Z	joss	ikonia	i just thought, that those patches i need only would apply only for ubuntu source
2008-09-24T16:04:00.000Z	ikonia	joss	no
2008-09-24T16:08:00.000Z	joss	ikonia	have you used aufs on ubuntu?
2008-09-24T16:18:00.000Z	joss	ikonia	that patch does not apply, since fs/aufs dir in vanilla, is completely missing
2008-09-24T16:18:00.000Z	joss	ikonia	what i mostly want to know, is, if that is possible to merge fuse branches with initrd aufs union?
