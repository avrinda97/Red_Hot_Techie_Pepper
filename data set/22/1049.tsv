2010-10-31T00:34:00.000Z	bodavis6		I am an old MS user and I can't figure out how to install anything on Ubuntu unless it's in the software center.
2010-10-31T00:35:00.000Z	bodavis6		I think Linux is for programming professionals only.
2010-10-31T00:37:00.000Z	bodavis6		I downloaded the deb packages then double clicked on them... it asked for a location so I gave C:\Helix then it did nothing except copy it's files there.
2010-10-31T00:37:00.000Z	bodavis6		It didn't install.
2010-10-31T00:37:00.000Z	brontoeee	bodavis6	there is no c:\ on linux
2010-10-31T00:38:00.000Z	bodavis6		Oh, well it said it made one...
2010-10-31T00:38:00.000Z	bodavis6		Brontoeee. I just want to be able to watch movies on my computer.
2010-10-31T00:38:00.000Z	bodavis6		Can't find a way to do that.
2010-10-31T00:39:00.000Z	brontoeee	bodavis6	what kind of movies? what are their extensions? online movies (give the example url?)?
2010-10-31T00:40:00.000Z	bodavis6		Just rented movies. I can watch anything I rent on Windows.
2010-10-31T00:40:00.000Z	bodavis6	brontoeee	I want to learn LINUX but it's very difficult.
2010-10-31T00:41:00.000Z	brontoeee	bodavis6	DVDs?
2010-10-31T00:41:00.000Z	bodavis6		Brontoeee, no I haven't, I just supposed that a video player on Ubuntu would have the necessary codecs.
2010-10-31T00:42:00.000Z	bodavis6		Brontoeee, yes, DVD's
2010-10-31T00:42:00.000Z	brontoeee	bodavis6	just install vlc, that should do the trick, i think it is in the repos
2010-10-31T00:43:00.000Z	bodavis6		Brontoeee, why can't I install Real's deb player in UBUNTU?
2010-10-31T00:43:00.000Z	bodavis6		I will look for vlc. Thanks.
2010-10-31T00:43:00.000Z	brontoeee	bodavis6	why realplayer? i dont think realplayer can play dvds
2010-10-31T00:43:00.000Z	bodavis6		Sure it can,
2010-10-31T00:44:00.000Z	bodavis6		Even quicktime.
2010-10-31T00:44:00.000Z	bodavis6	brontoeee	does quicktime have a LINUX version?
2010-10-31T00:44:00.000Z	brontoeee	bodavis6	not that i know of
