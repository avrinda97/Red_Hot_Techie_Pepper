2008-01-03T01:44:00.000Z	bob__	ikonia	Jack here... :)  Have any luck with dlink routers?
2008-01-03T01:45:00.000Z	ikonia	bob__	dlink routers ?
2008-01-03T01:45:00.000Z	bob__		yep
2008-01-03T01:45:00.000Z	ikonia	bob__	should I be doing something with them ?
2008-01-03T01:45:00.000Z	bob__		I can connect direct to cable modem but not through the router
2008-01-03T01:46:00.000Z	bob__	ikonia	Yes, but the current nick is not regged
2008-01-03T01:46:00.000Z	ikonia	bob__	ok, so what's the deal, you can connect through a modem but not the router ?
2008-01-03T01:46:00.000Z	ikonia		!wtf > yv
2008-01-03T01:47:00.000Z	bob__		yep.. really odd.. I cannot 192.168.0,1 into it either.
2008-01-03T01:47:00.000Z	ikonia	bob__	are you sure the router is using address range of 192 ?
2008-01-03T01:47:00.000Z	bob__		other computers can get through just not this new one
2008-01-03T01:47:00.000Z	ikonia	bob__	do you  get a dhcp address from it when you plug it in ?
2008-01-03T01:47:00.000Z	ikonia	bob__	are you using cable or wirless
2008-01-03T01:47:00.000Z	bob__		direct connect
2008-01-03T01:48:00.000Z	bob__		no dhcp no irc nothing
2008-01-03T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	bob__	so if you don't have dhcp requests running, how are you getting an IP ?
2008-01-03T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	bob__	are the other clients getting ip's from dhcp ?
2008-01-03T01:48:00.000Z	bob__		I am bypassing the router right now.
2008-01-03T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	bob__	of course, hence why I can see you
2008-01-03T01:49:00.000Z	bob__	ikonia	I dont know I have no access to them atm
2008-01-03T01:49:00.000Z	ikonia	bob__	I guess that's what you've got to check
2008-01-03T01:49:00.000Z	ikonia	bob__	or it's the things I'd be checking
