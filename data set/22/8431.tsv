2005-08-31T16:10:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	nobody.
2005-08-31T16:11:00.000Z	juanej	Blissex	i just installed xfce and fonts are too small
2005-08-31T16:13:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	your problem is very familiar to me...
2005-08-31T16:13:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	and it is a mess :-). The DPI is usually computed from the monitor visible image size in millimiters and in pixels.
2005-08-31T16:14:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	the best thing to do is to ensure that the X configuration includes the monitor size in millimiters correctly.
2005-08-31T16:14:00.000Z	juanej	Blissex	do i have to measure it? lol
2005-08-31T16:14:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	the second best thing is to force the ''right'' DPI at X server startup.
2005-08-31T16:14:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	I did it with a ruler, really.
2005-08-31T16:14:00.000Z	juanej	Blissex	what line do i have to add to xorg.conf?
2005-08-31T16:14:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	however for example LCD screens have the display image size in mm in the specs.
2005-08-31T16:15:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	also, many monitors, if the support DDC, will tell the X server the size, but that's not as good
2005-08-31T16:15:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	because the actual display image size depends on CRTs on the amount of black border for example...
2005-08-31T16:15:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	the right line id 'DisplaySize' in the 'Monitor' section.
2005-08-31T16:17:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	72 sounds a bit too low for a modern system.
2005-08-31T16:27:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	either add '-dpi <whatever>' to where the X server is started, or use 'DisplaySize' in the _right_ 'Monitor' section.
2005-08-31T16:27:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	what kind of monitor is yours BTW? inches, type and pixels you got on it.
2005-08-31T16:28:00.000Z	juanej	Blissex	 SyncMater 551c 15' 800x600
2005-08-31T16:28:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	that _may_ be a 72 DPI display.
2005-08-31T16:29:00.000Z	juanej	Blissex	its already at 72
2005-08-31T16:30:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	thats the point I was making -- 72 might be the right resolution. Wait a sec for me to check.
2005-08-31T16:30:00.000Z	Blissex	juanej	BTW, why aren't you running it at 1024x768? That should be possible, if a little blurrier.
