2011-03-01T15:06:00.000Z	jnjnjn		Anyone have time to help me ASAP? My system says "An error occurred while mounting" when i try to boot
2011-03-01T15:06:00.000Z	jnjnjn		last thing i remember doing was mounting a ftp through nautilus
2011-03-01T15:06:00.000Z	ruan_	jnjnjn	looks like something happened to fstab
2011-03-01T15:07:00.000Z	jnjnjn	ruan_	my fstab looks normal
2011-03-01T15:07:00.000Z	jnjnjn		syays though UIID=45058d9d-4ef2-4ccf-b587-0eba53e61d06 / ext4 error=remount -ro 0 1
2011-03-01T15:07:00.000Z	jnjnjn		says though *
2011-03-01T15:08:00.000Z	ruan_	jnjnjn	error=remount. so it wont let you pass without mounting?
2011-03-01T15:08:00.000Z	jnjnjn	ruan_	yes that drive is where my filesystem is on
2011-03-01T15:09:00.000Z	ruan_	jnjnjn	ah. is it UIID or UUID?
2011-03-01T15:09:00.000Z	jnjnjn		In my fstab it says UUID
2011-03-01T15:09:00.000Z	jnjnjn	ruan_	think that UUID is correct
2011-03-01T15:10:00.000Z	ruan_	jnjnjn	are you on the machine?
2011-03-01T15:10:00.000Z	jnjnjn	ruan_	i have booted from livecd and mounted the filesystem so i can edit the files
2011-03-01T15:14:00.000Z	jnjnjn	ruan_	i have irc on another computer so if you have any suggestions i can run them on my machine
2011-03-01T15:20:00.000Z	jnjnjn	ruan_	sorry im impatient, think you can help me out?
2011-03-01T15:21:00.000Z	jnjnjn		im in a pinch here :)
2011-03-01T15:21:00.000Z	ruan_	jnjnjn	i don't think i'll be able to help, but someone else may be able to
2011-03-01T15:21:00.000Z	jnjnjn		ok
2011-03-01T15:21:00.000Z	jnjnjn		can i run nautilus from a mounted filesystem?
2011-03-01T15:22:00.000Z	ruan_	jnjnjn	all i can think of is using "sudo fdisk -l" and verifying some data
2011-03-01T15:24:00.000Z	jnjnjn	ruan_	it all happed after i tried to mount a ftp drive through nautilus (i think thats the source of evil anyways)
2011-03-01T15:24:00.000Z	jnjnjn	ruan_	maybe i need to unmount that drive, thats why im asking if i can run nautilus from a mounted filesystem
