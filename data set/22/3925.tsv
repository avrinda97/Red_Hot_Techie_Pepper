2010-06-28T17:48:00.000Z	Kaaiman		I really need the alternate version for my 128 MB RAM notebook, now I have to mess with alternative methods...
2010-06-28T17:49:00.000Z	Slart	Kaaiman	ouch.. 128MB.. how old is that thing?
2010-06-28T17:51:00.000Z	Slart	Kaaiman	I'm wondering if it might not be easier to start with the minimal install cd..
2010-06-28T17:52:00.000Z	Slart	Kaaiman	perhaps point that to the lubuntu repositories after the install (lubuntu has its own repositories, right?)
2010-06-28T17:53:00.000Z	Slart	Kaaiman	ah.. you can't use the lubuntu regular install cd as repository ?
2010-06-28T17:53:00.000Z	Kaaiman	Slart	that's exactly what I'm doing now
2010-06-28T17:54:00.000Z	Slart	Kaaiman	ah.. sorry.. I don't think I've been reading the entire conversation
2010-06-28T17:54:00.000Z	Slart	Kaaiman	I'm going to give this a try in a vm.. see if I can get it to work
2010-06-28T17:59:00.000Z	Kaaiman	Slart	if you have any clue, please call me... I'll stay here in the chat
2010-06-28T17:59:00.000Z	Slart	Kaaiman	sure.. one more question.. you've got some kind of wired connection to the net on this laptop? or it's wireless only?
2010-06-28T18:00:00.000Z	Kaaiman	Slart	I have no cable for the PCMCIA card, only a USB ethernet stick with RT2500 (Linux compatible) chipset
2010-06-28T18:01:00.000Z	Kaaiman	Slart	and it seems I can only setup wireless with the network manager... I only have to fill in ESSID and WEP and it works directly out of the box
2010-06-28T18:01:00.000Z	Slart	Kaaiman	ok, I'll try without any network connection.. using the lubuntu install cd as repository
2010-06-28T18:02:00.000Z	Kaaiman	Slart	here it says: "W: Skipping nonexisten file /media/apt/dists/lucid/main/binary-i386/Packages" and the same message for "/media/apt/dists/lucid/restricted/binary-i386/Packages
2010-06-28T18:03:00.000Z	Slart	Kaaiman	hmm.. lets see if I get the same
2010-06-28T18:46:00.000Z	Kaaiman	Slart	did you get the same error?
2010-06-28T19:08:00.000Z	Slart	Kaaiman	ok, tried with the 10.04 alternate install as a base, then I tried adding the lubuntu cd as a repository but it didn't like that at all.. same error messages that you got
2010-06-28T19:09:00.000Z	Kaaiman	Slart	ok tnx for trying
2010-06-28T19:15:00.000Z	Kaaiman	Slart	crap, it even doesn't recognize the Xubuntu cd
2010-06-28T19:15:00.000Z	Kaaiman	Slart	did you install with (x)ubuntu alternate or with mini.iso?
2010-06-28T19:16:00.000Z	Slart	Kaaiman	I installed the ubuntu alternate version first.. command line only
2010-06-28T19:16:00.000Z	Slart	Kaaiman	the minimal iso required an internet connection.. I figured I would try without that first
