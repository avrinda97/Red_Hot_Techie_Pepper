2009-11-23T23:01:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	any reason you're trying to run VBA in Wine?
2009-11-23T23:02:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	sudo apt-get install visualboyadvance
2009-11-23T23:04:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	I think you have to start it like VisualBoyAdvance <name of file>
2009-11-23T23:08:00.000Z	flootenkerp	draconis	I get this "bash: syntax error near unexpected token `(' "
2009-11-23T23:08:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	that's really strange, you must have a borked install
2009-11-23T23:09:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	VisualBoyAdvance does not spawn a bash shell. what are you typing
2009-11-23T23:11:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	it's case sensitive. the program is VisualBoyAdvance, not visualboyadvance. also, the parentheses are there to show you that it's something to fill in... DON'T actually type them
2009-11-23T23:12:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	what EXACTLY are you typing
2009-11-23T23:13:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	the game file is definitely not that
2009-11-23T23:14:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	for instance I might type: VisualBoyAdvance "Metroid Prime Zero.rom" or VisualBoyAdvance coolgame.rom
2009-11-23T23:14:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	VisualBoyAdvance "Metroid Prime Zero.gba". You had better really have the file in the current directory, though
2009-11-23T23:15:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	the quotes in this case are necessary
2009-11-23T23:15:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	um, how should I know? you're the one who downloaded it
2009-11-23T23:15:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	pwd command tells you where you are
2009-11-23T23:18:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	well if you'd pastebin the output...
2009-11-23T23:18:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste
2009-11-23T23:21:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	ls ~/.vba
2009-11-23T23:21:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	paste that
2009-11-23T23:22:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	ls ~/.vba , as in what's in that directory
2009-11-23T23:26:00.000Z	draconis	flootenkerp	btw, just install visualboyadvance-gtk. that's got a frontend that doesn't require extracting command line output
2009-11-23T23:29:00.000Z	flootenkerp	draconis	But now when I loaded the game, it just gives me a white screen
