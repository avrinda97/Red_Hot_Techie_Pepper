2004-10-10T09:54:00.000Z	hypatia		Is evolution uninstallable at the moment?
2004-10-10T09:54:00.000Z	hypatia		It's complaining about conflicts with evolution-data-server
2004-10-10T09:55:00.000Z	cliff	hypatia	are you running it inside gnome ?
2004-10-10T09:55:00.000Z	cliff		or KDE for that matter
2004-10-10T09:55:00.000Z	hypatia	cliff	I never run it at all. But I have it installed, I just did an "update" and now aptitude wants to uninstall it.
2004-10-10T09:55:00.000Z	cliff		oh ok.
2004-10-10T09:55:00.000Z	hypatia	cliff	further investigation reveals that it conflicts with the new version of evolution-data-server
2004-10-10T09:56:00.000Z	cliff		which version is it trying to remove ?
2004-10-10T09:56:00.000Z	cliff		1.6.4?
2004-10-10T09:56:00.000Z	hypatia		No, 2.0
2004-10-10T09:56:00.000Z	hypatia		2.0 evolution conflicts with data-server 1.0.1\
2004-10-10T09:56:00.000Z	cliff		oh, awesome.
2004-10-10T09:56:00.000Z	hypatia		or >= 1.0.1 rather
2004-10-10T09:57:00.000Z	cliff		do you use the data server ?
2004-10-10T09:57:00.000Z	hypatia	cliff	no, but evolution also depends on it.
2004-10-10T09:57:00.000Z	hypatia	cliff	it looks like the only solution is to hold data-server at 1.0.0
2004-10-10T09:57:00.000Z	cliff	hypatia	if you're not using either of them, just remove it.
2004-10-10T09:57:00.000Z	hypatia		But aptitude doesn't work that out on its own.
2004-10-10T09:57:00.000Z	cliff		I didn't know there was a 1.0.1 version of the data server.
2004-10-10T09:58:00.000Z	cliff		I don't know why you have it installed, I use evolution, but don't have the data server installed
2004-10-10T09:58:00.000Z	hypatia	cliff	evolution lists it as a dependency (2.0.0-ubuntu3)
2004-10-10T10:00:00.000Z	cliff	hypatia	the box I'm referencing isn't actually tuning ubuntu.
