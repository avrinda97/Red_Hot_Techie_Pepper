2010-10-15T09:06:00.000Z	agreimann		apt-get does not work, Aemaeth. Thanks for your help so far. Any suggestions?
2010-10-15T09:07:00.000Z	agreimann		Is the comp's HDD bad?
2010-10-15T09:07:00.000Z	agreimann		All the other apps work.
2010-10-15T09:08:00.000Z	agreimann		Hold on. Let me try to run it again on the other computer...
2010-10-15T09:08:00.000Z	agreimann		OK. Back.
2010-10-15T09:09:00.000Z	agreimann		It's a notebook, so it's right beside me.
2010-10-15T09:09:00.000Z	agreimann		The disk is clicking, and wait a second, please...
2010-10-15T09:09:00.000Z	agreimann		OK. Have the errors.
2010-10-15T09:09:00.000Z	agreimann		E: Read error - read (5: Input/output error).
2010-10-15T09:09:00.000Z	izinucs	agreimann	if your disk is clicking.. backup your data if you have any.. the drive may be dying
2010-10-15T09:10:00.000Z	agreimann		E: The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.
2010-10-15T09:10:00.000Z	agreimann		I did a fsck on startup with shutdown -rF now.
2010-10-15T09:10:00.000Z	agreimann		So I don't know... is the drive bad?
2010-10-15T09:10:00.000Z	agreimann	maco	Right. I know that.
2010-10-15T09:11:00.000Z	agreimann		I thought it might be a file system error.
2010-10-15T09:11:00.000Z	agreimann		Thanks for helping so far. May I ask one more question: Can I fix the bad sectors?
2010-10-15T09:12:00.000Z	agreimann		Can Linux remap bad sectors on the drive? It's an older one. :)
2010-10-15T09:12:00.000Z	agreimann		Seriously. I know Win95 can do something like this.
2010-10-15T09:13:00.000Z	agreimann		Seriously? That bad?
2010-10-15T09:13:00.000Z	izinucs	agreimann	clicking means hardware failure.. not bad sectors..
2010-10-15T09:13:00.000Z	izinucs	agreimann	new drives are cheap..
