2011-12-24T13:21:00.000Z	meskarune		I love how people freak out every time there is a UI change.
2011-12-24T13:21:00.000Z	meskarune		so many gnome complaints
2011-12-24T13:22:00.000Z	meskarune		I use fluxbox
2011-12-24T13:23:00.000Z	meskarune		lots of people like unity. its more touch friendly, which is what tech is moving toward now.
2011-12-24T13:24:00.000Z	meskarune		I don't use unity
2011-12-24T13:24:00.000Z	meskarune		but its silly to say that it sucks or that its terrible
2011-12-24T13:24:00.000Z	meskarune		its different
2011-12-24T13:24:00.000Z	meskarune		that is all
2011-12-24T13:25:00.000Z	meskarune		if you don't like it, use soemthing else
2011-12-24T13:25:00.000Z	meskarune		different also doesn't mean bad
2011-12-24T13:25:00.000Z	stevecam	meskarune	its not ready, it should of been left in development
2011-12-24T13:26:00.000Z	meskarune		switch to debian?
2011-12-24T13:26:00.000Z	meskarune		most of the things put into ubuntu should be in developement still.
2011-12-24T13:26:00.000Z	meskarune		like all the beta software....
2011-12-24T13:27:00.000Z	meskarune		I don't have a start menu or panel
2011-12-24T13:28:00.000Z	meskarune	lyrae	tab complete. :)
2011-12-24T13:29:00.000Z	meskarune		make a folder called places, sym link all your servers to that folder
2011-12-24T13:30:00.000Z	stevecam		i find it rude of ubuntu to not include an option to select the gnome-shell from the login screen
2011-12-24T13:30:00.000Z	stevecam		"We are happy with this change, you should be too!"
2011-12-24T13:31:00.000Z	meskarune		there is a simple solution though: use another distrobution. like mint, or debian
2011-12-24T13:31:00.000Z	stevecam		what bug is it?
2011-12-24T13:32:00.000Z	stevecam	meskarune	i was really happy with ubuntu, i am a annoyed at this change because it feels like what was ubuntu is now something else
