2009-01-31T19:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	UnknownFear	Did you go through the troubleshooting section we linked earlier
2009-01-31T19:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	UnknownFear	THat is the problem with unsupported hardware
2009-01-31T19:59:00.000Z	UnknownFear	Jack_Sparrow	my sound card IS supported. I used to have Ubuntu and I got it to work, but that was months ago. I'm starting fresh with Ununtu
2009-01-31T20:10:00.000Z	UnknownFear	Jack_Sparrow	I replied, but you did not answer. My sound card is supported
2009-01-31T20:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	UnknownFear	What sound card make and chipset
2009-01-31T20:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	UnknownFear	it means dont paste into the channel,  we have a website you can paste into and just give us a link number
2009-01-31T20:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	UnknownFear	yes
2009-01-31T20:19:00.000Z	UnknownFear	Jack_Sparrow	Makes sense now :) By the way, my sound card is supported
2009-01-31T20:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	UnknownFear	perhaps supported if you compile your own kernel, there are differsnt levels of  support
2009-01-31T20:20:00.000Z	UnknownFear	Jack_Sparrow	I used to have Ubuntu and I got my sound card working, but I don't think I had to re-compile kernels.
2009-01-31T20:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	UnknownFear	Did you not understand the use of enter key
2009-01-31T20:22:00.000Z	UnknownFear	Jack_Sparrow	I pasted that from the paste bins! I put in the user I wanted to post from, than the content, than I copied the text, but it put it wrong...
2009-01-31T20:28:00.000Z	UnknownFear	Jack_Sparrow	What does that package do that you linked to jared1?
2009-01-31T20:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	UnknownFear	tells me his sources list.. it is a command, not a link
2009-01-31T20:29:00.000Z	UnknownFear	Jack_Sparrow	oh, lol. I tried to use it :P
2009-01-31T20:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	UnknownFear	look at the pastebin link..
2009-01-31T20:30:00.000Z	UnknownFear	Jack_Sparrow	Does it provide the pastebin link in the channel?
2009-01-31T20:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	UnknownFear	No.. in the term for you to paste to a helper
2009-01-31T20:31:00.000Z	UnknownFear	Jack_Sparrow	Oh. You mean the "Poster" field? Do I put who I want to post to? I tried that, than I pasted it into the channel, but it made it look weird
2009-01-31T20:39:00.000Z	UnknownFear	Jack_Sparrow	am I able to join your chat aswell?
2009-01-31T20:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	UnknownFear	sure for a sec..
