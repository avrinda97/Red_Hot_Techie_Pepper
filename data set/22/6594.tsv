2006-09-11T06:31:00.000Z	ComputinChuck		hello everyone
2006-09-11T06:32:00.000Z	ComputinChuck		is there a place that documents how all the interal ubuntu stuff works?
2006-09-11T06:32:00.000Z	ComputinChuck		i.e. how hal in ubuntu does its thing
2006-09-11T06:32:00.000Z	Flamekebab	ComputinChuck	how ubuntu works? Like, ALL of it?
2006-09-11T06:32:00.000Z	ComputinChuck	Flamekebab	yea
2006-09-11T06:33:00.000Z	Flamekebab	ComputinChuck	are you new to this?
2006-09-11T06:34:00.000Z	ComputinChuck	Flamekebab	hehe, not quite
2006-09-11T06:36:00.000Z	ComputinChuck	Flamekebab	they say twice your ram up to 2GB
2006-09-11T06:36:00.000Z	Flamekebab	ComputinChuck	my laptop has 1280MB
2006-09-11T06:37:00.000Z	ComputinChuck	Flamekebab	ok, i'd do 512 or something
2006-09-11T06:37:00.000Z	ComputinChuck	Flamekebab	i don't swap hardly at all
2006-09-11T06:38:00.000Z	ComputinChuck	Flamekebab	yea, like i said, i've never had more than 20Mb filled in my swap and i don't know why that 20 got filled
2006-09-11T06:39:00.000Z	Flamekebab	ComputinChuck	everyone else, should I go with Ext3 as I normally do, or does anyone recommend one of the other FSs?
2006-09-11T06:39:00.000Z	ComputinChuck	Flamekebab	I uses reiser myself.  lots of benchmarks report reiser as very fast, stable all that
2006-09-11T06:40:00.000Z	ComputinChuck	Flamekebab	if you really need the journaling, you'd probably better stay with ext3
2006-09-11T06:42:00.000Z	ComputinChuck	Flamekebab	XFS is about as fast as reiser, but it's meant more for large files
2006-09-11T06:45:00.000Z	ComputinChuck	Flamekebab	i'd have to agree...but it seems a little sluggish compared to my slackware system...
2006-09-11T06:48:00.000Z	ComputinChuck	Flamekebab	i don't doubt it...someone out there's gotta be hard-core enough
2006-09-11T06:57:00.000Z	ComputinChuck	Flamekebab	the bluetooth one?
2006-09-11T06:57:00.000Z	Flamekebab	ComputinChuck	nope
2006-09-11T06:58:00.000Z	ComputinChuck	Flamekebab	haha
2006-09-11T06:59:00.000Z	ComputinChuck	Flamekebab	true..
