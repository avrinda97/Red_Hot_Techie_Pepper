2006-03-17T15:51:00.000Z	IceTox		Hello, where do I set the root passwd in ubuntu? I'm not used to a distro without an active root
2006-03-17T15:51:00.000Z	_jason	IceTox	don't run 'sudo passwd', read what the bot sent you first
2006-03-28T16:56:00.000Z	_jason	IceTox	system > preferences > screen resolution first, if it isn't listed there, see !fixres
2006-04-26T16:57:00.000Z	_jason	IceTox	unzip
2006-04-26T06:36:00.000Z	_jason	IceTox	you buy it
2006-04-26T06:36:00.000Z	IceTox	_jason	yeah, well I was thinking about some other package some guy in here talked about the other day.. Some photoshop Open Source solution :-) With all the photoshop options
2006-04-26T06:37:00.000Z	_jason	IceTox	oh, well if you remember what it was called, I'd like to know too :)
2006-04-26T06:37:00.000Z	IceTox	_jason	I'd tell you that if I knew instead of coming around with a grumpy "buy it" comment :-P
2006-04-26T06:37:00.000Z	_jason	IceTox	D:
2006-04-27T13:29:00.000Z	_jason	IceTox	what does 'file name_of_file.tar.gz' say?
2006-04-27T13:29:00.000Z	IceTox	_jason	I will paste it now
2006-04-27T13:31:00.000Z	IceTox	_jason	gnomefreak apokryphos and kbrooks: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12736
2006-04-27T13:35:00.000Z	_jason	IceTox	gunzip the file and then run 'file' on it again
2006-04-27T13:36:00.000Z	_jason	IceTox	when you did gunzip, you should end up with file.tar.  Did you do 'file file.tar' then?
2006-04-27T13:37:00.000Z	_jason	IceTox	gunzip file.tar.gz
2006-04-27T13:40:00.000Z	IceTox	_jason	hehe.. got it now :-9 thanks a lot
2006-04-27T13:40:00.000Z	_jason	IceTox	it is still a tar though?
2006-04-27T13:41:00.000Z	IceTox	_jason	it changed from tar.gz to tar, and then I was able to tar -zxvf it :-)
2006-04-27T13:42:00.000Z	_jason	IceTox	k
2006-04-27T13:42:00.000Z	_jason	IceTox	looks like someone gzipped it twice
2006-04-30T06:08:00.000Z	_jason	IceTox	sudo fdisk -l
2006-04-30T06:09:00.000Z	IceTox	_jason	that gives me only for hda.. Shouldn't there be like any hdb and shit?
