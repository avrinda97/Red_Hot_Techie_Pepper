2007-04-15T09:39:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		no, i'll keep it because Mom loves it
2007-04-15T09:39:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		Maybe
2007-04-15T09:39:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		I'll teach it to her
2007-04-15T09:39:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		Ok, i'm off for (re)downloading Ubuntu
2007-04-15T09:39:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		Ciao!!!!
2007-04-15T09:41:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		What version should i download, Strable or Beta
2007-04-15T09:41:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		6.10 or 7.05
2007-04-15T09:42:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		Ok, maybe 6.10 because i am a n***
2007-04-15T09:42:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		But i like Betas, for some odd reason i always try every Beta i see
2007-04-15T09:43:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		Feisty, i prefer to call it Ubuntu
2007-04-15T09:43:00.000Z	variant	Drk_Guy	the feisty version is only beta in name at the moomment.. although there are allways special cases of hardware issues of course. there isin't much reason not to use it already
2007-04-15T09:45:00.000Z	variant	Drk_Guy	it will still be called feisty when it's not beta
2007-04-15T09:46:00.000Z	variant	Drk_Guy	just call it feisty like everyone else
2007-04-15T09:47:00.000Z	variant	Drk_Guy	what?
2007-04-15T09:48:00.000Z	variant	Drk_Guy	some people would find your comment to be highly offensive. you should really watch what you say
2007-04-15T09:56:00.000Z	variant	Drk_Guy	no.. no "the" it is an interface to a popular one though.. called iptables
2007-04-15T09:58:00.000Z	variant	Drk_Guy	that is not the reccomeneded way to install them on ubuntu
2007-04-29T14:42:00.000Z	variant	Drk_Guy	heard you the first time
2007-08-11T11:28:00.000Z	variant	Drk_Guy	it's only for wireless
2007-08-11T11:28:00.000Z	variant	Drk_Guy	windows wireless drivers
2007-08-11T11:29:00.000Z	variant	Drk_Guy	that seems unlikely
2007-08-11T11:34:00.000Z	variant	Drk_Guy	ln -s source destination
