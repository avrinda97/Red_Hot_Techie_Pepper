2010-05-15T21:34:00.000Z	AbuBadr		hi all
2010-05-15T21:34:00.000Z	AbuBadr		may i ask?
2010-05-15T21:36:00.000Z	AbuBadr		i have 4 GB RAM   but in system i can see only 2.2 GiB  !!!
2010-05-15T21:36:00.000Z	coz_	AbuBadr	  is this a 64 bit system or 32 bit?
2010-05-15T21:36:00.000Z	coz_	AbuBadr	 open a terminal and run     uname -m
2010-05-15T21:37:00.000Z	coz_	AbuBadr	 ok that is a 32 bit ubuntu you have installed
2010-05-15T21:38:00.000Z	coz_	AbuBadr	  however  your actual hardware may be 64 bit in which case you can either do what mezen  suggested or reinstall with the 64 bit ubuntu cd      what cpu  do you have on that system?
2010-05-15T21:40:00.000Z	coz_	AbuBadr	 when you talk to someone here .. it is best to type the first couple letters of their name and hit the "tab" key to complete it so they can be allerted :)
2010-05-15T21:41:00.000Z	AbuBadr	coz_	i c
2010-05-15T21:41:00.000Z	coz_	AbuBadr	  yep thats how you alert someone :)
2010-05-15T21:47:00.000Z	AbuBadr	coz_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/433924/
2010-05-15T21:48:00.000Z	coz_	AbuBadr	  ok that is a 64 bit hardware   you could just install the 64bit ubuntu version
2010-05-15T21:48:00.000Z	coz_	AbuBadr	 then the system should see all of the memory :)
2010-05-15T21:48:00.000Z	AbuBadr	coz_	is there any easier way?
2010-05-15T21:49:00.000Z	AbuBadr	coz_	the way mezen told me!
2010-05-15T21:49:00.000Z	coz_	AbuBadr	 that is the other options....its one that i would not perform on a 64 bit hardware system though    I have never tried that
2010-05-15T21:49:00.000Z	coz_	AbuBadr	 however it may work but I am not the one to guide you on that
2010-05-15T21:50:00.000Z	AbuBadr	coz_	ok i c  thanks
2010-05-15T21:51:00.000Z	AbuBadr	coz_	 why?? :)
2010-05-15T21:52:00.000Z	coz_	AbuBadr	 just in case     I personally would walk you through it but I dont have experience with th at
2010-05-15T21:53:00.000Z	coz_	AbuBadr	 no offense was meant by that    I just want to be sure you get it correct :)
2010-05-15T21:53:00.000Z	AbuBadr	coz_	 thanks man :)
