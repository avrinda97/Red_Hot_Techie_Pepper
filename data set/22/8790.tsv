2005-05-23T09:31:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	what do u mean test the torrents?
2005-05-23T09:32:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	but what prbolem do u think it is? Bad torrent file? bad tracker?
2005-05-23T09:32:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	what/whose tracker r u using?
2005-05-23T09:33:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	wait... you're not making your own torrents, you're trying to download someone else's torrent
2005-05-23T09:34:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	are there any seeds?
2005-05-23T09:34:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	maybe their tracker is down
2005-05-23T09:34:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	use the torrents on ubuntulinux.org
2005-05-23T09:36:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	the CD is muiltilanguage, so I can only imagine the DVD should be as well
2005-05-23T09:36:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	use the offical torrents @ ubuntulinux.org
2005-05-23T09:37:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	if u want to look for torrents for other linux distros, try tlm-project.org
2005-05-23T09:38:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	just go to ubuntulinux.org will u?
2005-05-23T09:38:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	come back if u have trouble finding the torrent, but somehow I think i can manage  :)
2005-05-23T09:42:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	hmmm.... I'll look @ it
2005-05-23T09:46:00.000Z	Pischenberg	goofrider	works for you?
2005-05-23T09:47:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	I need to go to my windows desktop, my Azureus is installed there, I can get more info about the tracker/seeds
2005-05-23T09:51:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	it says 8 seeds and 18 peers
2005-05-23T09:51:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	but I can't get a connection either
2005-05-23T09:51:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	nor the CD ISO torrent. There are sources, just no connections....
2005-05-23T09:52:00.000Z	goofrider	Pischenberg	the tracker is live as well, I can't see why it won't connect. just wait for an afternoon and see if it'lll start eventually.
