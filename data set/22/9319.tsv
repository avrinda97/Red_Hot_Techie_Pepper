2006-05-27T16:29:00.000Z	tim_		what is the terminal command to create a folder?
2006-05-27T16:29:00.000Z	njan	tim_	mkdir
2006-05-27T16:31:00.000Z	njan	tim_	I just told you.
2006-05-27T16:32:00.000Z	njan	tim_	current working directory
2006-05-27T16:34:00.000Z	njan	tim_	current working directory, like I said. If you want to untar somewhere else, specify it at the end of the command
2006-05-27T16:34:00.000Z	njan	tim_	man tar will tell you all about it.
2006-05-27T16:35:00.000Z	njan	tim_	same goes about most commands - 'man' is your friend :)
2006-05-27T16:37:00.000Z	tim_	njan	ok how do i move a folder now
2006-05-27T16:37:00.000Z	njan	tim_	mv
2006-05-27T16:38:00.000Z	tim_	njan	so i have to type: sudo mv DESTINATION SOURCE
2006-05-27T16:38:00.000Z	njan	tim_	man mv
2006-05-27T16:39:00.000Z	njan	tim_	man tells you all you need to know :)
2006-05-27T16:39:00.000Z	tim_	njan	yeah i did that but its confusing
2006-05-27T16:39:00.000Z	njan	tim_	one of the first lines on the manpage is        mv [OPTION] ... SOURCE DEST
2006-05-27T16:39:00.000Z	njan	tim_	how is that confusing?
2006-05-27T16:46:00.000Z	tim_	njan	i used cp and it said "omitting directory"
2006-05-27T16:46:00.000Z	njan	tim_	you need to copy in recursive mode
2006-05-27T16:46:00.000Z	njan	tim_	again, the man page is enlightening ;)
2006-05-27T16:47:00.000Z	tim_	njan	i want to copy the contents of a folder and put them in another folder
2006-05-27T16:48:00.000Z	njan	tim_	I'm not trying to insult you by pointing at manpages.. it's just something about fish, and teaching, and lifetimes.
2006-05-27T16:48:00.000Z	njan	tim_	manpages and google can answer 95% of linux-related queries within about 2 minutes.
2006-05-27T16:50:00.000Z	tim_	njan	hallelujah. thanks
