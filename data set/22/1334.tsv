2010-07-29T11:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxFetus	use that guide until the embedded video. It will force the framebuffer driver until you get to login then your nvidia/ati card will kick in
2010-07-29T11:57:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	ActionParsnip	I'm not sure what that means, yet, but I will read and get back to you if I have questions/problems.  Thank you :)
2010-07-29T11:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxFetus	it walks you through it. The proprietary driver isn't loaded right away so the display stinks. The frmebuffer driver is quicker and will give a display for the duration of the boot
2010-07-29T12:02:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	ActionParsnip	It appears that this is making me change my proprietary driver to a generic one (I have a GeForce 6800)... That's going to fix this?
2010-07-29T12:16:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	ActionParsnip	I did what the site said and it didn't work; instead of loading a black screen with a blinking underscore in the upper left hand corner, it now is just completely black.
2010-07-29T12:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxFetus	here's the one I used. Had to scan my favourites: http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-to-Fix-the-Big-and-Ugly-Plymouth-Logo-in-Ubuntu-10-04-140810.shtml
2010-07-29T12:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxFetus	little more involved but worked like a champ here
2010-07-29T12:20:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	ActionParsnip	should I undo what I did earlier?
2010-07-29T12:20:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	ActionParsnip	before moving onward with this?
2010-07-29T12:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxFetus	most of it is identical, just a few extra steps
2010-07-29T12:23:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	ActionParsnip	 Ahhh I think I may have done it incorrectly -- the "GRUB_GFXMODE=1280x1024" step requires uncommenting that line... I missed that before.
2010-07-29T12:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxFetus	d'oh. Keep going with the guide though
2010-07-29T12:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxFetus	I have to do it with my lappy with its crappy intel vga
2010-07-29T12:34:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	ActionParsnip	Well it's getting better but there are a couple of problems - it changed the resolution of Grub 2 -- now everything's tiny... I don't like that.  Secondly, the Ubuntu font/logo isn't there.  It's now just "Ubuntu 10.04" with serifs on the font and not the standard logo, if that makes sense.  My Grub is configured slightly differently.  Inside of /etc/grub.d, I have changed 40_custom to have options for the OS's I
2010-07-29T12:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxFetus	you could have just commented the entries in tehe various files you editted. Memtest is handy but is removable just like any other package
2010-07-30T00:12:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	ActionParsnip	are you there?
2010-07-30T00:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxFetus	nar :)
2010-07-30T00:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxFetus	make it quick
2010-07-30T00:13:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	ActionParsnip	hey here's what my startup/shutdown screens look like, now.  http://pastebin.com/JBwi87Zu
2010-07-30T00:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxFetus	I'll have to check later dude, maybe someone else can help
2010-09-11T09:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LinuxFetus	3rd party companies still support 32bit better than 64bit (broter and canon are 2 that spring to mind), it's just an easier life for new users etc
