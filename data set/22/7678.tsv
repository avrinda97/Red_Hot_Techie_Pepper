2006-03-08T06:48:00.000Z	Engla		now I'm angry. Gnome just randomly refuses to log in. Usually I'm able to fix it, but this time it wont... it just sits with a brown screen before the sound and the ubutnu splash is shown... how do I solve this.
2006-03-08T06:48:00.000Z	Engla		I've tried the .ICEAuthority file perms
2006-03-08T06:48:00.000Z	canllaith	Engla	emptying /tmp might help, sometimes there are stale lock files
2006-03-08T06:48:00.000Z	canllaith	Engla	and also, check the permissions on /tmp if you can't write to it gnome will not start
2006-03-08T06:48:00.000Z	Engla	canllaith	well I've rebooted twice
2006-03-08T06:49:00.000Z	Engla	canllaith	what should tmp permissions be? they look okay -- drwxrwxrwt, root:root
2006-03-08T06:50:00.000Z	canllaith	Engla	that looks fine
2006-03-08T06:50:00.000Z	Engla	canllaith	and I can't experiment however I want because the computer locks up randomly when I kill gdm. Not every time.. will try now
2006-03-08T06:56:00.000Z	Engla	canllaith	It did actually work!! First I rm -rf:ed  /tmp, that was a bad Idea, but when recreating it empty again, it worked. Now I have another trick in my toolbox thanks (and yes, this was caused by improper shutdown (lack of power/laptop) so no surprise there
2006-03-08T06:56:00.000Z	canllaith	Engla	glad to help
2006-03-08T06:57:00.000Z	Engla	canllaith	This dir was supposed to be emptied at boot, though. I don't get that it wasn't..
2006-03-08T06:57:00.000Z	canllaith	Engla	*shrugs*
2006-03-08T06:57:00.000Z	canllaith	Engla	I've only used Ubuntu for one day now
2006-03-08T07:40:00.000Z	Engla	canllaith	welcome to ubuntu then. Which distro did you come from?
2006-03-08T07:40:00.000Z	canllaith	Engla	slackware
2006-03-08T07:41:00.000Z	canllaith	Engla	I still run slackware on my desktop, but wanted to try a debian on my laptop for the convenience of apt-getting any apps I might want rather than compiling them :)
2006-03-08T07:41:00.000Z	Engla	canllaith	I hope you like apt-get
2006-03-08T07:42:00.000Z	Engla	canllaith	I certainly like it, but I've never used anything else. Even on osx I used apt-get
2006-03-08T07:42:00.000Z	canllaith	Engla	frankly, right now I hate everything about it - but I hate every operating system, I'm very fair and unbiased about that.
2006-03-08T07:43:00.000Z	Engla	canllaith	I switched completely just recently. But I really love osx
2006-03-08T07:43:00.000Z	Engla	canllaith	but I switched completely to ubuntu
2006-03-08T07:43:00.000Z	canllaith	Engla	I kinda have a bit of everything as far as operating systems goes
