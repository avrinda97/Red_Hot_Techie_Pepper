2009-06-04T01:40:00.000Z	mimiloon		i everybody, i'm new to linux and have a problem with virtualbox (ubuntu9.04 host) and that is: when i'm using virtual machine in full screen and after the host goes into screen saver, the keyboard stops working till i shut down the guest OS; does anyone know how to fix this issue?
2009-06-04T01:41:00.000Z	cabrey	mimiloon	do you have guest additions installed?
2009-06-04T01:41:00.000Z	mimiloon	cabrey	yes
2009-06-04T01:42:00.000Z	cabrey	mimiloon	is this only when you are using virtualbox?
2009-06-04T01:42:00.000Z	mimiloon	cabrey	as-far-as-i-know, yes
2009-06-04T01:43:00.000Z	cabrey	mimiloon	what happens when you take the virtual machine out of fullscreen or exit virtualbox altogether?
2009-06-04T01:44:00.000Z	mimiloon	cabrey	the keyboard starts working
2009-06-04T01:44:00.000Z	cabrey	mimiloon	does it start working when virtualbox is quit or the vm is out of fullscreen?
2009-06-04T01:45:00.000Z	mimiloon	cabrey	in older version of ubuntu, i had no problems with the keyboard and virtalbox
2009-06-04T01:45:00.000Z	cabrey	mimiloon	what version of virtualbox?
2009-06-04T01:46:00.000Z	mimiloon	cabrey	when it quits; i have to shut down the vm using the mouse
2009-06-04T01:46:00.000Z	mimiloon	cabrey	version 2.2.4 (latest

2009-06-04T01:47:00.000Z	cabrey	mimiloon	sound like your issue?
2009-06-04T01:48:00.000Z	mimiloon	cabrey	yes
2009-06-04T01:49:00.000Z	cabrey	mimiloon	there does not seem to be a solution to this quirk -- just a workaround
2009-06-04T01:49:00.000Z	cabrey	mimiloon	switch virtual desktops type something, then switch back
2009-06-04T01:54:00.000Z	mimiloon	cabrey	thanks for your help
2009-06-22T22:59:00.000Z	cabrey	mimiloon	you want to connect to two different networks using two different wireless cards?
2009-06-22T23:00:00.000Z	mimiloon	cabrey	yes
2009-06-22T23:03:00.000Z	cabrey	mimiloon	if you go into System > Preferences > Network Connections, you can make a profile for each card
2009-06-22T23:04:00.000Z	mimiloon	cabrey	thanks
