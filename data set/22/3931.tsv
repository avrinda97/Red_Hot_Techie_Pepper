2008-12-25T18:25:00.000Z	TimMatrix		Could anyone please assist with my query, re: microphone not turned on from my Quickcam?  I use Ubuntu 8.10
2008-12-25T18:27:00.000Z	TimMatrix		do anyone know how to turn the microphone on from my webcam (BUILT-IN MIC)??
2008-12-25T18:29:00.000Z	Yuji1	TimMatrix	For your microphone, does alsabring it up?
2008-12-25T18:32:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Yuji1	sorry, i was in the loo.  I'll try alsabring.
2008-12-25T18:33:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Yuji1	how do I do that?
2008-12-25T18:33:00.000Z	Yuji1	TimMatrix	Perfectly fine. Alsa? Well I had some utility, hrm. Allows me to change the levels of audio input/output (volume) for all channels.
2008-12-25T18:34:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Yuji1	hrm?
2008-12-25T18:35:00.000Z	Yuji1	TimMatrix	Trying to remember the GUI.
2008-12-25T18:35:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Yuji1	what's HRM?
2008-12-25T18:35:00.000Z	Yuji1	TimMatrix	No clue. :/
2008-12-25T18:35:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Yuji1	sorry, okay.
2008-12-25T18:36:00.000Z	Yuji1	TimMatrix	Ah yes, right-click volume control (notification area, bottom right of screen usually) and "Open Volume Control"
2008-12-25T18:36:00.000Z	Yuji1	TimMatrix	Try going through the microphone inputs turning them up. If the current device doesn't work, try changing devices to find the microphone for your camera. Worth a try.
2008-12-25T18:37:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Yuji1	okay, but where do I find the microphone settings?
2008-12-25T18:38:00.000Z	Yuji1	TimMatrix	In Device, try selecting the one you think will most probably be the camera. Tab: Recording should be your microphone/input for it. Worth a try.
2008-12-25T18:39:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Yuji1	sorry, i'm learning, so where is Device Manager?
2008-12-25T18:40:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Yuji1	I know, just the equivalence, please?
2008-12-25T18:41:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Yuji1	well, you say "Devices", so where do I look that one up?  in /devs?
2008-12-25T18:41:00.000Z	Yuji1	TimMatrix	God d...Right-click volume control, Open Volume Control. Right in front of you.
2008-12-25T18:45:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Yuji1	When I opened the 'Sound Preferences', I clicked test button next to "Sound Capture", and it came up with the error report as follows: gconfaudiosrc ! audioconvert ! autioresample ! gconfaudiosink profile=chat: Could not open audio device for playback.
2008-12-25T18:45:00.000Z	Yuji1	TimMatrix	...
2008-12-25T18:47:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Yuji1	yes?
