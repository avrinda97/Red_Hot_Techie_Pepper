2007-01-23T15:08:00.000Z	fredl		anybody here has a Geforce 7600/6600? What's a decent approx. of how many FPS glxgears should give?
2007-01-23T15:09:00.000Z	fredl		I'm getting only approx. 4k FPS with glxgears....
2007-01-23T15:11:00.000Z	blue-frog	fredl	what says   glxinfo  ?
2007-01-23T15:11:00.000Z	fredl	blue-frog	well it says direct rendering is on....
2007-01-23T15:12:00.000Z	blue-frog	fredl	at the beginning of the output... direct rendering... server glx vendor string..
2007-01-23T15:12:00.000Z	fredl	blue-frog	and server glx vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
2007-01-23T15:12:00.000Z	fredl	blue-frog	and OpenGL renderer string: GeForce 7600 GS/PCI/SSE2
2007-01-23T15:12:00.000Z	fredl	blue-frog	so it has detected my card properly alright...
2007-01-23T15:13:00.000Z	blue-frog	fredl	have you installed nvidia drivers (either from synaptic or from nvidia)?
2007-01-23T15:14:00.000Z	fredl	blue-frog	I they come standard in Ubuntu don't they?
2007-01-23T15:15:00.000Z	blue-frog	fredl	no you have to install nvidia-glx from synaptic then
2007-01-23T15:15:00.000Z	blue-frog	fredl	once it is done you have to   sudo modprobe nvidia  (just in case..) then..
2007-01-23T15:16:00.000Z	fredl	blue-frog	my bad, it's installed already.
2007-01-23T15:16:00.000Z	blue-frog	fredl	sudo nvidia-glx-config enable and then restart your session (ctrl alt return)
2007-01-23T15:17:00.000Z	fredl	blue-frog	it's already enabled.
2007-01-23T15:17:00.000Z	blue-frog	fredl	have you seen nvidia logo when you restarted your session?
2007-01-23T15:17:00.000Z	fredl	blue-frog	no I don't get that.
2007-01-23T15:18:00.000Z	fredl	blue-frog	but I have the nvidia kernel module loaded.
2007-01-23T15:18:00.000Z	blue-frog	fredl	then there is something wrong with your nvidia-glx install
2007-01-23T15:19:00.000Z	fredl	blue-frog	so what to do??
2007-01-23T15:20:00.000Z	blue-frog	fredl	besides trying to purge and then reinstall nvidia-glx , dunno
2007-01-23T15:21:00.000Z	fredl	blue-frog	argh, I had already done sudo nvidia-xconfig obviously :)
