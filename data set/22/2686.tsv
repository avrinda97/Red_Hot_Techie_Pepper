2009-05-12T01:38:00.000Z	fortunev		in Transmission, is there a progress log that I can view remotely?
2009-05-12T01:38:00.000Z	tones	fortunev	yes, theres a web interface
2009-05-12T01:38:00.000Z	tones	fortunev	somewhere in the preferences
2009-05-12T01:39:00.000Z	fortunev	tones	no way to setup the web service remotely I gues?
2009-05-12T01:39:00.000Z	fortunev	tones	thanks
2009-05-12T01:40:00.000Z	tones	fortunev	it should already be running, but with a random password and a random port
2009-05-12T01:40:00.000Z	tones	fortunev	no problem
2009-05-12T01:41:00.000Z	fortunev	tones	would you mind opening up your transmission to see what the default url is?
2009-05-12T01:42:00.000Z	tones		the url is your ip address... you probably dont know that...
2009-05-12T01:42:00.000Z	tones	fortunev	the url is your ip address... you probably dont know that...
2009-05-12T01:42:00.000Z	fortunev	tones	I meant the default port
2009-05-12T01:42:00.000Z	fortunev	tones	i do have the address
2009-05-12T01:43:00.000Z	tones	fortunev	well the port is the port it is downloading from as far as i remember
2009-05-12T01:44:00.000Z	tones	fortunev	which can be any...
2009-05-12T01:44:00.000Z	tones	fortunev	perhaps do an nmap of your ip?
2009-05-12T01:44:00.000Z	fortunev	tones	I will give it a shot
2009-05-12T01:45:00.000Z	fortunev	tones	that did not work, but I dont have a web server running either. Not sure how to kick one off
2009-05-12T01:46:00.000Z	tones	fortunev	the web interface may be disabled. you want to whip up a web server remotely? is that even sane?
2009-05-12T01:47:00.000Z	fortunev	tones	making my head heart thinking about it :)
2009-05-12T01:47:00.000Z	tones	fortunev	i second that :P
2009-05-12T01:48:00.000Z	fortunev	tones	I' have a look when I get home. Thanks again
2009-05-12T01:48:00.000Z	tones	fortunev	dont mention it :)
