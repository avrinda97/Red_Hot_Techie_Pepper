2006-03-09T08:05:00.000Z	Czar``	ompaul	yes it is
2006-03-09T07:59:00.000Z	ompaul	Czar``	ISP having issues? network having issues?
2006-03-09T08:00:00.000Z	Czar``	ompaul	i thought ISP issues but ive never had a problem with comcast. I've had some torrents downloading for days at a time without a disconnection. As for network issues, everything in the house runs through the same router and i havent had a problem. Could it be some cron job running? Im new to those
2006-03-09T08:01:00.000Z	ompaul	Czar``	not unless it is one to take down the ethernet card for a couple of hours
2006-03-09T08:01:00.000Z	ompaul	Czar``	is it on the same network as you are on atm?
2006-03-09T08:01:00.000Z	Czar``	ompaul	unfortunately not, Im at work and was trying to access the box and finally got sick of it being down so often
2006-03-09T08:02:00.000Z	Czar``	ompaul	i suppose I could try a fresh install if that would help..
2006-03-09T08:02:00.000Z	ompaul	Czar``	it is not rebooting so it is not "down" all you know is that the comms channel is down - you do not know why, you need to establish that
2006-03-09T08:03:00.000Z	ompaul	Czar``	it could be that the ISP sees the packets for the web server and chooses to kill it
2006-03-09T08:03:00.000Z	Czar``	ompaul	exactally. I run some MOO severs (like mud) and their @uptime is like a month now...but i still have gaps in service.
2006-03-09T08:03:00.000Z	ompaul	Czar``	may not be in their aup, I don't know,
2006-03-09T08:03:00.000Z	Czar``	ompaul	see. now it just went back up
2006-03-09T08:04:00.000Z	Czar``	ompaul	The server has been up for 9 days, 1 hour, 45 minutes, and 56 seconds.
2006-03-09T08:04:00.000Z	Czar``	ompaul	i appreciate your help and suggestions.
2006-03-09T08:04:00.000Z	ompaul	Czar``	 is it the same IP the whole time?
2006-03-09T08:05:00.000Z	Czar``	ompaul	well its not static but its been the same for over a year now
2006-03-09T08:08:00.000Z	ompaul	Czar``	why not prove it can't get out I will now work out how
2006-03-09T08:08:00.000Z	Czar``	ompaul	so sit at the box at home and when it goes out, work with it?
2006-03-09T08:09:00.000Z	Czar``	ompaul	okay. according to the log, every morning at 0737, it does this: Mar  4 07:37:26 czaralex exiting on signal 15 //  Mar  4 07:37:27 czaralex syslogd 1.4.1#16ubuntu6: restart.
2006-03-09T08:10:00.000Z	Czar``	ompaul	everything else in the log is -- MARK --
2006-03-09T08:15:00.000Z	ompaul	Czar``	no more like touch somefile then from cron triger a script that says >> date >> somefile; tracepath some.location >> somefile << and let that run before and after the failure then you have a log of when it stops working then you can also see if it is at your connection with your isp etc ...
2006-03-09T08:16:00.000Z	Czar``	ompaul	I understand what that does but ive never played with cron before. I'm sorry. that's beyond me at the moment.
