2008-12-22T10:24:00.000Z	tritium	silv3r_m00n	xsane is the best bet.
2008-12-22T10:25:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	tritium	it showing no devices found
2008-12-22T10:26:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	tritium	therealnanotube : i forgot to power on my scanner :))

2008-12-22T10:28:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	tritium	ah coooool ... it worked perfect
2008-12-22T10:28:00.000Z	tritium	silv3r_m00n	glad to hear it, buddy!
2008-12-22T10:31:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	tritium	one more thing.... i want to install some of those good themes i got from kde-looks .... but they need to be compiled i think
2008-12-22T10:33:00.000Z	tritium	silv3r_m00n	sorry, I don't use KDE.  If you can't get an answer here, try asking in #kubuntu.
2009-02-06T11:32:00.000Z	tritium	silv3r_m00n	you don't.  Why?
2009-02-06T11:33:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	tritium	there is a package whose previous version was better
2009-02-06T11:33:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	tritium	i want it back
2009-02-06T11:33:00.000Z	tritium	silv3r_m00n	which are you referring to, and why?
2009-02-06T11:34:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	tritium	hplip  in the previous version I had more control of the dpi settings... after upgrade there are fewer options
2009-02-06T11:34:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	tritium	so i want the previous version of hplip
2009-02-06T11:35:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	tritium	this force version gives me 2 options
