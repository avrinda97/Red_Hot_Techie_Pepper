2006-06-20T16:03:00.000Z	HotDrive		good day all
2006-06-20T16:04:00.000Z	HotDrive		need help
2006-06-20T16:04:00.000Z	HotDrive		Dapper updates itself, but does it uninstall the previous kernel?
2006-06-20T16:04:00.000Z	LjL	HotDrive	no, it doesn't by default
2006-06-20T16:05:00.000Z	LjL	HotDrive	you should (if you want) uninstall it manually, *after* a reboot
2006-06-20T16:05:00.000Z	LjL	HotDrive	right.
2006-06-20T16:05:00.000Z	LjL	HotDrive	an "apt-get remove linux-image-blah" will fix that
2006-06-20T16:06:00.000Z	HotDrive	LjL	is that the command to use to uninstall?
2006-06-20T16:06:00.000Z	LjL	HotDrive	yes.
2006-06-20T16:08:00.000Z	LjL	HotDrive	be sure to have a look at Ubotu's stuff
2006-06-20T16:09:00.000Z	LjL	HotDrive	25 is the current kernel
2006-06-20T16:11:00.000Z	LjL	HotDrive	yes, i think you can quite safely remove it
2006-06-20T16:11:00.000Z	LjL	HotDrive	you could probably remove 23 too, but if you don't mind too much keeping it, having a fall-back is always nice
2006-06-20T16:12:00.000Z	HotDrive	LjL	I've read the ubotu... can I get aptitude from ADD/REMOVE programs?
2006-06-20T16:13:00.000Z	LjL	HotDrive	no need, you have it installed.
2006-06-20T16:14:00.000Z	LjL	HotDrive	prompt
2006-06-20T16:14:00.000Z	LjL	HotDrive	but you *can* use Synaptic to do the same thing, at any rate. (though i prefer aptitude for the reason that Ubotu gives)
2006-06-20T16:21:00.000Z	HotDrive	LjL	I've found the image... how do I select it to remove?
2006-06-20T16:21:00.000Z	LjL	HotDrive	in synaptic, don't know, i don't even have it installed
2006-06-20T16:25:00.000Z	HotDrive	LjL	Aptitude is really a good tool, thanks for the hint!
2006-06-20T16:33:00.000Z	HotDrive	LjL	still there?
2006-06-20T16:33:00.000Z	LjL	HotDrive	yes
