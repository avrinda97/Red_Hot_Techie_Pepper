2008-07-07T09:53:00.000Z	ubunubi	Josdell	that's incorrect. the boot flag is just for windows to look at. you need need something to boot the machine (grub/ntloader/etc)
2008-07-07T09:54:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	Is it possible though with any bootloader, to not change the MBR of the computer?
2008-07-07T09:55:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	Boot a partition off of a USB Drive without messing up the MBR of a Computer
2008-07-07T09:56:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	yes but if I installed Ubuntu on a USB Device with a bootloader(GRUB), are you saying it would still boot the Ubuntu partition?
2008-07-07T09:58:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	Yes but doesn't the computer( if it doesn't have GRUB installed)  fail at boot if the USB Device is not inserted?
2008-07-07T10:00:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	yes i know
2008-07-07T10:00:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	TO install it to the USB Device correct?
2008-07-07T10:01:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	How would I go about doing that?
2008-07-07T10:02:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	Do you mean /dev/sdb or /dev/sdb1 or something of the sort?
2008-07-07T10:03:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	Should I install in on the first partition of the USB Drive or the USB Drive itself?
2008-07-07T10:05:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	so my best bet would be to install GRUB on the USB Drive itself, remove the boot flag from the second partition(syslinux on GParted) and then reboot and try to boot from USB?
2008-07-07T10:06:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	is it relevant if the USB Device is the first boot device?
2008-07-07T10:07:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	not unless i go into the COmputer's boot menu right?
2008-07-07T10:09:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	Yeah I get what you're saying but on my computer I can select what I want to boot before it even starts
2008-07-07T10:09:00.000Z	ubunubi	Josdell	if you can select the USB drive from there...then by all means do so
2008-07-07T10:09:00.000Z	ubunubi	Josdell	my computer doesn't have that menu so i dont know
2008-07-07T10:10:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	Okay thanks for all the help, This is very important for me, I will be back here later to say If I was victorious or not. Bye everyone
2008-07-07T11:23:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	thank you, I installed the Ubuntu onto the first partition of the USB drive and GRUB onto the USB Device itself and
2008-07-07T11:24:00.000Z	ubunubi	Josdell	you shouldn't need to edit the /boot/grub/menu.lst at all...it should've been written by the install program
2008-07-07T11:26:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	I had to last time I did this because in GRUB hd0 stands for the device GRUB is installed on I believe. SO I need to change the root for Ubuntu to hd0 from hd1 right?
2008-07-07T11:27:00.000Z	ubunubi	Josdell	not 100% sure. but you can try it and see
2008-07-07T11:28:00.000Z	Josdell	ubunubi	okay thanks just wanted to see your answer, thanks bye
