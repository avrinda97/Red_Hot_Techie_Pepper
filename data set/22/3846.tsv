2008-05-14T05:44:00.000Z	PCDJ	lopin	do you have the right address to connect to for the dj radio?
2008-05-14T05:44:00.000Z	lopin	PCDJ	Yeah...  The button is greyed out
2008-05-14T05:45:00.000Z	PCDJ		cp ~/.xchat/sdclone/sdclone-x.x.pl ~/.xchat doesn't do anything but say i am not in a channel
2008-05-14T05:45:00.000Z	PCDJ		i know i am dumb with linux but i have to learn it
2008-05-14T05:52:00.000Z	lopin		Definitely need some help with IDJC
2008-05-14T05:52:00.000Z	PCDJ		no such file
2008-05-14T05:53:00.000Z	PCDJ		cp ~/.xchat/sdclone/sdclone-2.0.pl ~/.xchat
2008-05-14T05:54:00.000Z	lopin		Heyhey!  It only blanks out the button when I select shoutcast!
2008-05-14T05:54:00.000Z	PCDJ		if i can find the folder i can be sure
2008-05-14T05:55:00.000Z	lopin		Anyone know why IDJC isn't working with shoutcast?
2008-05-14T05:55:00.000Z	PCDJ		do what?
2008-05-14T05:56:00.000Z	lopin	PCDJ	It's greying out the server-connect button when I tell it to use shoutcast
2008-05-14T05:56:00.000Z	lopin	PCDJ	And I can't compile from source.  It's complaining about jack not existing when I just installed it...
2008-05-14T05:56:00.000Z	PCDJ	lopin	you have to be sure to have right PLS and right password and right port
2008-05-14T05:57:00.000Z	PCDJ		i had mine working on shoutcaszt i dont think i even have the JACK on it
2008-05-14T06:02:00.000Z	PCDJ		this is annoying i can not make this work
2008-05-14T06:02:00.000Z	lopin	PCDJ	I definitely have the correct information.  When I select Icecast, or Icecast2, the button is fine.  When I select Shoutcast, the button greys out...
2008-05-14T06:03:00.000Z	PCDJ		should be a lot easier to load a simple script or to even locate where it is installed ti
2008-05-14T06:03:00.000Z	PCDJ		to
2008-05-14T06:03:00.000Z	PCDJ		both
2008-05-14T06:03:00.000Z	PCDJ		in search?
2008-05-14T06:04:00.000Z	PCDJ	lopin	give me a sec i will load mine again in shoutcat make sure the server is not down
