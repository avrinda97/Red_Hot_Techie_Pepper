2008-07-26T12:58:00.000Z	gaelfx		halp! mys intarnets r broked!
2008-07-26T12:59:00.000Z	gaelfx		haha, it's funny how much easier it is to get attention here when acting stupid rather than giving a clearly stated problem
2008-07-26T13:00:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	gaelfx	there's a bash quote on that. Funny because it's true
2008-07-26T13:00:00.000Z	gaelfx	LSD|Ninja	really? could you point me to it?
2008-07-26T13:00:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	gaelfx	http://bash.org/?152037
2008-07-26T13:02:00.000Z	gaelfx	LSD|Ninja	haha, thanks man, brightened my day (sort of)
2008-08-10T12:06:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	gaelfx	what nForce MAC do you have?
2008-08-10T12:06:00.000Z	gaelfx	LSD|Ninja	not sure, how do I find out?
2008-08-10T12:06:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	gaelfx	what model board do you have?
2008-08-10T12:07:00.000Z	gaelfx	LSD|Ninja	well, the graphics card is 6150 Go!. not sure about which exact nForce chipset on the mainboard though
2008-08-10T12:07:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	gaelfx	do you know what mobo you have?
2008-08-10T12:07:00.000Z	gaelfx	LSD|Ninja	I don't even know what that is
2008-08-10T12:09:00.000Z	gaelfx	LSD|Ninja	what is mobo?
2008-08-10T12:09:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	gaelfx	motherboard, mainboard, that thing that sits in the bottom of the case with everything else connected to it
2008-08-10T12:10:00.000Z	gaelfx	LSD|Ninja	well, could you just tell me how to find the information you want?
2008-08-10T12:10:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	gaelfx	I take it you didn;'t build this machine yourself?
2008-08-10T12:10:00.000Z	gaelfx	LSD|Ninja	it's a laptop...
2008-08-10T12:19:00.000Z	gaelfx	LSD|Ninja	is MCP51 the info you're looking for?
2008-08-10T12:21:00.000Z	gaelfx	LSD|Ninja	or better yet: http://paste.ubuntu.com/36130/
2008-08-10T12:23:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	gaelfx	It's an nForce4 derivative as I suspected meaning it almost certainly has the gigabit version of the MAC. Those are notoriously flaky, even under Windows.
2008-08-10T12:24:00.000Z	gaelfx	LSD|Ninja	so you're saying I should chuck my lappy out the window?
2008-08-10T12:24:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	gaelfx	it's AMD, you should never have bought it in the first place :P
