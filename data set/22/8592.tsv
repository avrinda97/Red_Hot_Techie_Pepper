2006-03-27T13:02:00.000Z	_michael_		how do i shrink my ubuntu partition?
2006-03-27T13:04:00.000Z	_michael_		but i can't shrink the partition i'm using, can I?
2006-03-27T13:05:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	you can boot to a live disk and use it from there, I've heard gparted has it's own small live cd
2006-04-01T14:08:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	i believe you need to search for 'libfaad' and 'libfaac' and install those for .m4a, etc.
2006-04-01T14:11:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	try searching for 'gstreamer0.8-faac and -faad"
2006-04-01T14:16:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	hmmm, I have gstreamer0.8-faad
2006-04-01T14:16:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	what version of ubuntu ?
2006-04-01T14:17:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	same as me, I assume you have all your repos, universe, multiverse ?
2006-04-01T14:18:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	well, see, that's the thing, to be honest, I don't own an ipod, nor do i have any apple tunes..however this was the method i was told i was to follow
2006-04-01T14:19:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	that package is suppose to be there http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=gstreamer0.8-faad&searchon=names&subword=1&version=breezy&release=all
2006-04-01T14:20:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	sorry I couldn't be of any more help
2006-04-01T14:22:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	out of curiosity, what program are you using to listen to them ?
2006-04-01T14:24:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	so what you're saying is that even if it were working, you really wouldn't be able to tell cause you can't hear it ? is that what you're saying ? :P
2006-04-01T14:25:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	amaroK does ;)
2006-04-01T14:26:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	it makes me cry it's so nice :P
2006-04-01T14:27:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	far better than any player for windows imho
2006-04-01T14:38:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	well, afaik, if you have the 2 gstreamer libraries -faad and -faac those should be the decoders, and the the other two should help you encode, but again, I haven't ever used them in practice
2006-04-01T14:39:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	anytime :)
2006-04-01T14:40:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	I use both Ubuntu and Kubuntu, right now I'm on Kubuntu :)
2006-04-01T14:45:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	get the spaces out of the file name and yes you need the >
2006-04-01T14:46:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	err, I meant |   d'oh
2006-04-01T14:52:00.000Z	tristanmike	_michael_	sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.8-mad
