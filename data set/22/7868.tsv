2006-07-03T07:22:00.000Z	dstyrk		Hi all.. need some help.. I just did an install from the alternate CD... BUT now I can figure out how to launch ubuntu.. I am stuck after the login
2006-07-03T07:22:00.000Z	dstyrk		Is there a command I am not typing?
2006-07-03T07:23:00.000Z	dstyrk		How do I get to the desktop?!!!!!
2006-07-03T07:23:00.000Z	dli	dstyrk	can you select Sessions (to gnome fail safe), before typing username to login in gdm?
2006-07-03T07:24:00.000Z	dstyrk	dli	What does that mean?  I don't know much about Linux yet
2006-07-03T07:25:00.000Z	dli	dstyrk	at the login prompt (graphic one), there's a place called either " Options ", or "Sessions", click to select
2006-07-03T07:25:00.000Z	dli	dstyrk	do you have the graphic one yet?
2006-07-03T07:26:00.000Z	dstyrk	dli	I followed the alternate instructions.
2006-07-03T07:28:00.000Z	dstyrk	dli	Well any ideas?
2006-07-03T07:28:00.000Z	dli	dstyrk	do you have the graphic login prompt (gdm) yet?
2006-07-03T07:29:00.000Z	dstyrk	dli	no.. Haven't got that far.. I thought that after the reboot from the install would have taken me there.. What do I need to do?
2006-07-03T07:30:00.000Z	dli	dstyrk	login at console (non-graphic one), do: sudo apt-get -f install ubuntu-desktop
2006-07-03T07:30:00.000Z	dstyrk	dli	thanks
2006-07-03T07:31:00.000Z	dstyrk	dli	it is now asking for a disk I do not have..  Or will the alternate CD work?
2006-07-03T07:32:00.000Z	dli	dstyrk	do you have network?
2006-07-03T07:35:00.000Z	dli	dstyrk	if it's connected, install via network
2006-07-03T07:35:00.000Z	dstyrk	dli	 Umm.. internet?  I just put the alternte CD in.. It's running.. I don't know if its right or not
2006-07-03T07:35:00.000Z	dstyrk	dli	 How do I do it?
2006-07-03T07:35:00.000Z	dli	dstyrk	clean up your /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-07-03T07:36:00.000Z	dstyrk	dli	 I'm lost, and very new to this.
2006-07-03T07:37:00.000Z	dli	dstyrk	ask ubotu about easysource, you need to make a new /etc/apt/sources.list, then upgrade
2006-07-03T07:39:00.000Z	dstyrk	dli	They told me this was going to be easy... This has been a pain in the but from day one..   I have no idea what you are talking about with the easysource and what not.
