2005-09-05T08:46:00.000Z	titaniumone		is it possible something in ubuntu is blocking bittorrent?
2005-09-05T08:46:00.000Z	titaniumone		i've never used it before and nothing will work, i can't connect to trackers/peers
2005-09-05T08:46:00.000Z	CarlFK	titaniumone	- no.
2005-09-05T08:47:00.000Z	CarlFK	titaniumone	- even if you are totaly blocked, you should get something
2005-09-05T08:49:00.000Z	CarlFK	titaniumone	- give me the URL to a torrent you are trying to use
2005-09-05T08:52:00.000Z	CarlFK	titaniumone	- forget that.  something is hosed.  I am not forwarding any BT ports, and i just got the whole file
2005-09-05T08:53:00.000Z	CarlFK	titaniumone	- 30 seeds, 0 peers.
2005-09-05T08:53:00.000Z	titaniumone	CarlFK	it just downloaded okay will i was in dmz mode on my router. turning dmz back on now to test again
2005-09-05T08:58:00.000Z	CarlFK	titaniumone	- something is wacked.  can that box connect to anything on the net? (like irc, web....)(
2005-09-05T08:59:00.000Z	titaniumone	CarlFK	the ubuntu box? yes i have apache, ftp, mysql, ssh, freenx all running/forwarded and working fine.
2005-09-05T08:59:00.000Z	CarlFK	titaniumone	- I just did btdownloadcurses.py BitTornado-0.3.7-w32install.exe.torrent
2005-09-05T08:59:00.000Z	CarlFK	titaniumone	but can a client connect from that box to a server the net?
2005-09-05T09:00:00.000Z	titaniumone	CarlFK	yes, i'm talking from it right now in xchat
2005-09-05T09:00:00.000Z	titaniumone	CarlFK	with my router in DMZ to the ubuntu machine, i could do that as well. worked after a 10 second pause or so. with DMZ off i can't download anymore, so i think it's port related, but i'm forwarding 6881-6889 and 10000-10004 tcp and udp to this machine.
2005-09-05T09:01:00.000Z	CarlFK	titaniumone	- try getting rid of the port forwaring.  that helps BT, but isn't required
2005-09-05T09:01:00.000Z	titaniumone	CarlFK	ok ill turn it off completely
2005-09-05T09:03:00.000Z	CarlFK	titaniumone	- same command (no switches)?
