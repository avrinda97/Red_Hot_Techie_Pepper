2010-02-12T22:58:00.000Z	babo1		xhost:  unable to open display ":0.0"
2010-02-12T22:58:00.000Z	babo1		any one have any ideas about this ?
2010-02-12T22:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	babo1	what happens if you just try "xchat"
2010-02-12T22:59:00.000Z	babo1	ZykoticK9	No protocol specified
2010-02-12T22:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	babo1	are you in X?
2010-02-12T22:59:00.000Z	babo1	ZykoticK9	yes
2010-02-12T23:00:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	babo1	are you signed in as root, or trying to use sudo?
2010-02-12T23:00:00.000Z	babo1	ZykoticK9	i'm signed into terminal as root
2010-02-12T23:00:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	babo1	that's the problem!
2010-02-12T23:01:00.000Z	babo1	ZykoticK9	still doesn't work when i sign out of root
2010-02-12T23:01:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	babo1	are you logged into X as root?
2010-02-12T23:01:00.000Z	babo1	ZykoticK9	nope
2010-02-12T23:03:00.000Z	babo1	ZykoticK9	i can't open xclock
2010-02-12T23:03:00.000Z	babo1	ZykoticK9	i can open it as user 'babo'. but not as user 'oracle' or 'root'
2010-02-12T23:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	babo1	the error you're getting with xchat is saying it can't open a windows in X - most usually caused because you're trying to run it as root (which is blocked in some instances)
2010-02-12T23:04:00.000Z	babo1	ZykoticK9	i get the same error when i try it as oracle
2010-02-12T23:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	babo1	you shouldn't really be trying to open ANY application as root (with only occasional exceptions)
2010-02-12T23:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	babo1	why are you trying to run things under different users?
2010-02-12T23:05:00.000Z	babo1	ZykoticK9	i'm trying to install oracle 11g
2010-02-12T23:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	babo1	that doesn't seem to have anything to do with running xchat as root/oracle?  I have never installed "Oracle 11g", don't even know what that is - but typically you'd run the install with "sudo" if it's a command line thing, or "gksu" if it's a graphical installer
