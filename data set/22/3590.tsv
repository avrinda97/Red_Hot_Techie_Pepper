2009-03-05T07:33:00.000Z	Huufarted		Anybody here work with Samba much?  I just added and set up a new account that can access his home directory, but I can't set up my login (the original) to access his samba share.
2009-03-05T07:34:00.000Z	Huufarted		k
2009-03-05T07:35:00.000Z	Huufarted		!ops | thegamez
2009-03-05T07:36:00.000Z	Huufarted		Question for the active folks in here.  Was that an inappropriate !ops moment?
2009-03-05T07:37:00.000Z	LjL	Huufarted	no, it was ok to call ops, although it was also useless because i got highlighted anyway - but you couldn't have known that
2009-03-06T03:24:00.000Z	LjL	Huufarted	sudo update-rc.d gdm remove
2009-03-06T03:24:00.000Z	LjL	Huufarted	(if you're using GDM, which is the default, as your login manager)
2009-03-06T03:25:00.000Z	LjL	Huufarted	besides haven't you considered using Server given it's, well, a server?
2009-03-06T03:25:00.000Z	Huufarted	LjL	it is the same.
2009-03-06T03:25:00.000Z	LjL	Huufarted	kernel's slightly different
2009-03-06T03:25:00.000Z	Huufarted	LjL	from what I understand, the only difference is the default installed apps and gdm.
2009-03-06T03:25:00.000Z	LjL	Huufarted	also, you get less cruft installed that isn't relevant to a server
2009-03-06T03:25:00.000Z	Huufarted	LjL	do you know how it's different?  NVM, i can go look it up
2009-03-06T03:25:00.000Z	Huufarted	LjL	cruft?
2009-03-06T03:25:00.000Z	LjL	Huufarted	not entirely - it does have the PAE extension enabled, i know that much
2009-03-06T03:26:00.000Z	LjL	Huufarted	GUI apps and such... i didn't mean cruft in a negative sense, just as stuff that a server won't need
2009-03-09T01:50:00.000Z	LjL	Huufarted	sure, -n
2009-03-09T01:50:00.000Z	Huufarted	LjL	thanks.  :)
2009-04-09T03:58:00.000Z	Huufarted	LjL	I don't think he knew fully what I meant by abusing it.
2009-05-04T02:30:00.000Z	Huufarted	LjL	ciao how it's spelled for most latin based European languages.  :) Just FYI
2009-05-04T02:31:00.000Z	LjL	Huufarted	93-47-42-195.ip111.fastwebnet.it is an italian address (my ISP, to be exact), just fyi ;)
2009-05-04T02:31:00.000Z	Huufarted	LjL	now that's doing your homework.
