2009-01-14T20:56:00.000Z	Owner		hello, I cant seem to get internet connection sharing to work from an ibookg4 2 my ubuntu box. The connection is established, but no pages will load
2009-01-14T20:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Owner	can you ping web pages by name and / or ip?
2009-01-14T20:58:00.000Z	Owner	ActionParsnip1	no
2009-01-14T20:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Owner	check the system using the shared connection, does it have a default gateway specified?
2009-01-14T20:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Owner	does it have dns servers specified in /etc/resolv.conf?
2009-01-14T21:00:00.000Z	Owner	ActionParsnip1	i'll check
2009-01-14T21:04:00.000Z	Owner	ActionParsnip1	should the nameserver be set to the computer's ip that is sharing the connection, or to something else?
2009-01-14T21:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Owner	i'd use the ones that the connection sharing one has
2009-01-14T21:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Owner	or 3rd party web based ones like 2.2.2.2
2009-01-14T21:06:00.000Z	Owner	ActionParsnip1	yeah, well that is already how it is set...hmmmm....
2009-01-14T21:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Owner	if you have set a static ip for your internally facing device on the ics system and the other pc is on the same network with a different ip that falls into the netwok mask of the ics systems ip (e.g.10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2 mask 255.255.255.0) and the default gateway of the client system is set to that of the ics's internal device ip you should be golden

2009-01-14T21:10:00.000Z	Owner	ActionParsnip1	ubuntu is 192.168.2.1  the sharing one(ibook) is 192.168.0.3   the router is 192.168.0.1  that is wrong, no?
2009-01-14T21:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Owner	if the router is connected to the ics system, and then the ics system is connected to the pc getting no internet then i'd say so
2009-01-14T21:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Owner	set the ics sharing device to 10.0.0.1 and the client system (currently webless) to 10.0.0.2
2009-01-14T21:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Owner	the webless wonders default gateway is now 192.168.0.1
2009-01-14T21:12:00.000Z	Owner	ActionParsnip1	oh.....thats why they do that  *!*
2009-01-14T21:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Owner	once you configure the masquerading, the system will see the traffic destined for the 192.168.0.1 address and push the traffic through its other port
2009-01-14T21:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Owner	technically you have 2 networks
2009-01-14T21:14:00.000Z	Owner	ActionParsnip1	ok, so then what is 0.0.0.0 all about??
2009-01-14T21:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Owner	thats a broadcast address
2009-01-24T19:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Owner	apt-cache search libxslt
