2009-12-11T06:34:00.000Z	Umifier		Question: Cannot find my "Marvell Yukon" Network card. I've tried everything from Ndiswrapper to the driverinstall from the marvell's homepage. My router + ISP is working. I have been googling the problem for the past 5hours and I havn't stumbled across any answer. Im using Jaunty Jackalope. Does anyone have any clue what i could do next?
