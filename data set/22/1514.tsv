2011-04-13T12:28:00.000Z	prov	red2kic	What did that mean?
2011-04-13T12:30:00.000Z	prov	red2kic	Opening the file is not the problem.
2011-04-13T12:32:00.000Z	prov	red2kic	Let me clarify, the script is in a directory and I compiled the presentation with a link to the script.
2011-04-13T12:37:00.000Z	red2kic	prov	Any chance you can upload (whatever it is). I still don't understand what you're trying to do.
2011-04-13T12:38:00.000Z	prov	red2kic	Let me see, hold on.
2011-04-13T12:40:00.000Z	prov	red2kic	The script http://paste.ubuntu.com/593467/ and the presentation http://paste.ubuntu.com/593468/
2011-04-13T12:42:00.000Z	prov	red2kic	Beyond pasting those texts I am not sure I can explain further. Notice the \href in the presentation. I hope this helps.
2011-04-13T12:42:00.000Z	red2kic	prov	I never use latex myself -- but I can grasp. Does ./video.sh work?
2011-04-13T12:42:00.000Z	prov	red2kic	you bet!
2011-04-13T12:42:00.000Z	red2kic	prov	I mean... \href{run:./video.sh}{Sample Video}
2011-04-13T12:43:00.000Z	red2kic	prov	Latex channel might be better place to ask FYI. :)
2011-04-13T12:43:00.000Z	prov	red2kic	It loads gvim instead of the terminal.
2011-04-13T12:43:00.000Z	prov	red2kic	I would have thought here because it has to do with evince and gnome and my user experience. :)
2011-04-13T12:44:00.000Z	red2kic	prov	So running .sh will start gvim?
2011-04-13T12:44:00.000Z	prov	red2kic	Yes, but not the terminal, which is what I need.
2011-04-13T12:44:00.000Z	red2kic	prov	Try right-click on .sh file -- Properties. Change that to gnome-terminal.
2011-04-13T12:45:00.000Z	prov	red2kic	Yes, I have tried this and it will open the terminal but the script is not called. It just sits there waiting and looking as though I opened a new terminal from the menu.
2011-04-13T12:46:00.000Z	prov	red2kic	Recap, changing the default open with does change evince behaviour but it does not execute the script.
2011-04-13T12:46:00.000Z	prov	red2kic	Odd right?
2011-04-13T12:47:00.000Z	red2kic	prov	I would think that you might have non-proper latex syntax. I can't be certain. Heh.
2011-04-13T12:48:00.000Z	prov	red2kic	That might be the case. I will have to keep trying. Thanks for you help though :)
2011-04-13T12:48:00.000Z	red2kic	prov	Look for latex channel. I highly recommend it. :)
