2006-11-02T17:43:00.000Z	kikokos		ljl now i`m in gnome
2006-11-02T17:43:00.000Z	LjL	kikokos	with your own "jo" user?
2006-11-02T17:47:00.000Z	LjL	kikokos	yes
2006-11-02T17:48:00.000Z	LjL	kikokos	go on. if i can answer
2006-11-02T17:49:00.000Z	LjL	kikokos	quite normal, your new "jer" user isn't a member of the "audio" group -- or of any groups your old "jo" user was a member of, for that matter
2006-11-02T17:49:00.000Z	LjL	kikokos	type "groups jo" and give me the output
2006-11-02T17:51:00.000Z	LjL	kikokos	ok, type "sudo -i", and then type these commands: adduser jer adm ; adduser jer dialout ; adduser jer cdrom ; adduser jer floppy ; adduser jer audio ; adduser jer dip ; adduser jer video ; adduser jer plugdev ; adduser jer lpadmin ; adduser jer scanner ; adduser jer admin"
2006-11-02T17:51:00.000Z	LjL	kikokos	ah no wait, you can't use sudo from jer. well, log in to "jo" from a console, then do that
2006-11-02T17:53:00.000Z	LjL	kikokos	type Ctrl+Alt+F2 - when you're finished, type Ctrl+Alt+F7 to come back here
2006-11-02T17:53:00.000Z	LjL	kikokos	actually, scrap that. just type "su - jo", it'll be easier
2006-11-02T06:01:00.000Z	LjL	kikokos	yes, log out and back in
2006-11-02T06:04:00.000Z	LjL	kikokos	you're welcome. perhaps try to tinker less with things you shouldn't be tinkering with, next time ;-P
2006-11-02T06:04:00.000Z	LjL	kikokos	no, i don't think
2006-11-02T16:29:00.000Z	kikokos	LjL	are u here ? :)
2006-11-02T16:29:00.000Z	LjL	kikokos	no
2006-11-02T16:29:00.000Z	kikokos	LjL	uhmm

2006-11-02T16:50:00.000Z	LjL	kikokos	heh, it's not like i know everything there is to know about ubuntu - hardly even close :P
