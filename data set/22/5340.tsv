2007-05-20T06:55:00.000Z	Xpcontact		got problem while installing ruby on rail in ubunutu
2007-05-20T06:56:00.000Z	Xpcontact		anyone could help me about to install ruby on rail ?
2007-05-20T06:57:00.000Z	Xpcontact		so i do not understand what  that means +
2007-05-20T06:58:00.000Z	Xpcontact		apt-get ?
2007-05-20T06:58:00.000Z	LjL	Xpcontact	APT is the Ubuntu packaging system, apt-get is just a frontend for it - but yes
2007-05-20T06:59:00.000Z	LjL	Xpcontact	enable Universe, and then install that "rails" package using Synaptic, apt-get or your preferred front-end
2007-05-20T07:00:00.000Z	LjL	Xpcontact	that would be unsurprising if you don't have ruby installed. also, why in the world are you running a ruby script as root...?
2007-05-20T07:01:00.000Z	Xpcontact	LjL	this is my second time in life touching ubuntu :D
2007-05-20T07:01:00.000Z	LjL	Xpcontact	well, if you don't want to have to install it a third, a fourth and a fifth time, please keep very well in mind that you should *never* do *anything* as root unless you know perfectly what you're doing - except for calling the package manger. let the package manager handle things.
2007-05-20T07:02:00.000Z	LjL	Xpcontact	we told you. enable Universe first. the link from the bot explains how
2007-05-20T07:02:00.000Z	LjL	Xpcontact	System / Administration / Software Source if i'm not very mistaken (i don't use GNOME). it isn't that hard.
2007-05-20T07:05:00.000Z	Xpcontact	LjL	if ruby is installed how can I call it ? or how to excute it ?
2007-05-20T07:06:00.000Z	LjL	Xpcontact	"ruby" will not give you a "command not found" error. try just typing "ruby".
2007-05-20T07:06:00.000Z	Xpcontact	LjL	in the terminal or  where ?
2007-05-20T07:07:00.000Z	LjL	Xpcontact	in the terminal
2007-05-20T07:07:00.000Z	Xpcontact	LjL	look : $ ruby
2007-05-20T07:07:00.000Z	LjL	Xpcontact	then you still don't have it installed (are you running Feisty, by the way? i wouldn't think so)
2007-05-20T07:07:00.000Z	LjL	Xpcontact	have you enabled Universe yet?
2007-05-20T07:08:00.000Z	LjL	Xpcontact	type  lsb_release -a  and paste the output
2007-05-20T07:08:00.000Z	LjL	Xpcontact	actually, i meant pastebin
2007-05-20T07:08:00.000Z	Xpcontact	LjL	look: lsb_release -a
