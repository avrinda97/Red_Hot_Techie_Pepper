2005-09-16T07:52:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dylan_	What's not to like about mplayer? :p
2005-09-16T07:52:00.000Z	dylan_	BlueEagle	just personal preference i guess
2005-09-16T07:52:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dylan_	Ahh well, gmplayer might not support skins. :)
2005-09-16T07:54:00.000Z	dylan_	BlueEagle	lol well ok
2005-09-16T07:55:00.000Z	dylan_	BlueEagle	ok i installed the whole mplayer-mozilla thing and the movies play sound but no video....

2007-06-06T06:59:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dylan_	Any .iso image burned are automatcally finalized afaik. (ie you can't burn a multi-session .iso image)
2007-06-06T07:00:00.000Z	dylan_	BlueEagle	alrightey, thanks.  do you have any inclination as to why my machine won't boot the cdrom, then?  i have the bios set to boot cd first, and i forced it to select the cd-rom as the boot media.
2007-06-06T07:00:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dylan_	The most common error is to burn the .iso as a file on the cd instead of burning the files on the image to the cd.
2007-06-06T07:01:00.000Z	dylan_	BlueEagle	i burned the image the correct way, which is why my laptop now uses GNU/Linux.
2007-06-06T07:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dylan_	How old is your cd-rom drive?
2007-06-06T07:01:00.000Z	dylan_	BlueEagle	a few years, but it works fine when i'm actually in the OS itself.
2007-06-06T07:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dylan_	Are you able to boot other CDs from it?
2007-06-06T07:02:00.000Z	dylan_	BlueEagle	occasionally.
2007-06-06T07:02:00.000Z	dylan_	BlueEagle	should i just shop for a new drive?
2007-06-06T07:03:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dylan_	Well if it's troublesome to boot from that might be a good idea. Especially if the disc boots on other machines/drives.
2007-06-06T07:03:00.000Z	dylan_	BlueEagle	thanks a lot.  i'll do that.  take care.
2007-06-06T07:03:00.000Z	BlueEagle	dylan_	No problem.
