2004-12-09T17:14:00.000Z	daniels		yah, that is a 2D operation
2004-12-09T17:15:00.000Z	daniels		however, you could use the 3D engine to accelerate that if you wanted to, which fglrx may actually do
2004-12-09T17:15:00.000Z	daniels		apparently
2004-12-09T17:15:00.000Z	daniels		i've not owned a card that hasn't had full 3d acceleration with the standard drivfers
2004-12-09T06:25:00.000Z	daniels		why did you recompile your kernel?
2004-12-09T06:25:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	daniels	: i always do
2004-12-09T06:26:00.000Z	daniels	Ti_Uhl	beware that by doing that, you just lost all security and bug support for your system
2004-12-09T06:27:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	daniels	: bug support ? what do u mean ?
2004-12-09T06:27:00.000Z	daniels	Ti_Uhl	well, if you're using our kernel, you get to file bugs on our bugzilla about it and have us fix them
2004-12-09T06:27:00.000Z	daniels	Ti_Uhl	if you rebuild your own kernel, we can't support that
2004-12-09T06:27:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	daniels	and is there any way i can patch my kernel to do that ?
2004-12-09T06:28:00.000Z	daniels	Ti_Uhl	to do what?
2004-12-09T06:28:00.000Z	daniels	Ti_Uhl	by using our kernel, and not one that you recompiled?
2004-12-09T06:28:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	daniels	: no by patching my kernel ?
2004-12-09T06:28:00.000Z	daniels	Ti_Uhl	how can you get bug support by patching your kernel?
2004-12-09T06:28:00.000Z	daniels	Ti_Uhl	why are you recompiling in the first place?
2004-12-09T06:29:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	daniels	: i found it odd myself but u said that by recompiling my kernel there wasn't any bug support anymore
2004-12-09T06:29:00.000Z	daniels	Ti_Uhl	if you use our kernel, we can support that.  if you use your kernel, we can't.
2004-12-09T06:30:00.000Z	daniels	Ti_Uhl	so either you can use our kernel and get bug support for it, or use your own and be on your own
2004-12-09T06:33:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	daniels	so u won't be able to help me with my sound card problem ?
2004-12-09T06:34:00.000Z	daniels	Ti_Uhl	not really, because I don't know what you've compiled in, and it probably worked before you recompiled your kernel
2004-12-09T06:36:00.000Z	Ti_Uhl	daniels	it worked before i recompiled and it still works but it uses 2 different mixers for the same device ? wich isn't that much of a problem but it ain't right either
