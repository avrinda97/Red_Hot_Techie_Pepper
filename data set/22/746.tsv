2012-02-28T12:42:00.000Z	urgodfather		will someone help me get wireless working on this laptop
2012-02-28T12:42:00.000Z	urgodfather		it shows in lspci but is "missing firmware"
2012-02-28T12:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	urgodfather	if it's hard to setup then it must be a broadcom wifi device,  I'm not sure there is a 100% solution for all of them
2012-02-28T12:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	urgodfather	I see articles like this http://techie-buzz.com/foss/wifi-ubuntu-install-broadcom-drivers.html  if that method fails just keep your other device pluged in and wait for better drivers to apear
2012-02-28T12:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	urgodfather	I thought that device still had internet from your pcmci slot device, can't he  use the b43-fwcutter method if it does CFHowlett, that was also in that article you gave him
2012-03-29T14:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	urgodfather	I use my android phone as a remote now with VLC, if you fail to get lirc working
2012-03-29T14:47:00.000Z	urgodfather	sacarlson	yeah i was doing that too with my htpc but wifi kills battery
2012-03-29T14:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	urgodfather	I'm not sure how much power used on wifi,  It runs for about 3 or more days 24/7 without a charge
2012-03-29T14:49:00.000Z	urgodfather	sacarlson	i know what you mean but... free ir remote... much easier... plus im about to reflash my phone
2012-03-29T14:50:00.000Z	urgodfather	sacarlson	what software do u use for htpc? mythtv? xbmc?
2012-03-29T14:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	urgodfather	I also have a ir remote on an old tv card but havn't used it since 2008  ubunt 8.04
2012-03-29T14:51:00.000Z	urgodfather	sacarlson	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=922944
2012-03-29T14:52:00.000Z	urgodfather	sacarlson	i can get it to show keypress's in the ir prog and with irw like in that thread
2012-03-29T15:00:00.000Z	urgodfather	sacarlson	sounds like it will be ntfs
2012-03-29T15:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	urgodfather	then I think there is a way  to change /etc/fstab for that mount to be forced to a user name needed
2012-03-29T15:02:00.000Z	urgodfather	sacarlson	thats what i was just about to say
2012-03-29T15:29:00.000Z	urgodfather	sacarlson	yeah
2012-06-28T07:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	urgodfather	be more specific what is the driver for why do you need THIS driver?
2012-06-28T07:46:00.000Z	urgodfather	sacarlson	its a HP Synaptics touchpad driver for SuSe 32-bit... it just so happens to be the best solution i have found to get my touchpad functioning properly as there is not a fix
2012-06-28T07:46:00.000Z	urgodfather	sacarlson	i have the ia32-libs installed aready
2012-06-28T07:47:00.000Z	urgodfather	sacarlson	i understand there will not be any support, that is fine. if i have to wipe and reload, then so be it.
2012-06-28T07:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	urgodfather	looks like it might be supported in the older 10.04 and 10.10 ubuntu also a workaround not sure you read it http://linux.aldeby.org/post/Ubuntu-Linux-on-HP-Pavilion-Part-7-Synaptics-Touchpad.html
