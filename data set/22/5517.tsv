2007-04-30T13:33:00.000Z	zeroday	CheshireViking	MIST_: you should both try envy
2007-04-30T13:34:00.000Z	zeroday	CheshireViking	go to xorg and change to vesa driver. it will get you a gui
2007-04-30T13:35:00.000Z	CheshireViking	zeroday	is there a website with a walkthrough on how to do that? I can't get it to start even to a command line interface
2007-04-30T13:36:00.000Z	zeroday	CheshireViking	not even command line
2007-04-30T13:36:00.000Z	zeroday	CheshireViking	does it freeze at usplash
2007-04-30T13:36:00.000Z	CheshireViking	zeroday	if if i do, even trying to edit xorf, I get a no screens error when I try to edit the file
2007-04-30T13:36:00.000Z	zeroday	CheshireViking	ill get u a gui
2007-04-30T13:37:00.000Z	CheshireViking	zeroday	no, its beyond the uspash, nautilus begins to start - it starts putting the icons as it starts up services & then it freezes & brings up the daemon error
2007-04-30T13:38:00.000Z	CheshireViking	zeroday	i'm not at the laptop now anyway, wouldn't be able to do anything for another 9 hours when i get home from work - if there's a website & can have a look at, I'll try that later though
2007-04-30T13:38:00.000Z	zeroday	CheshireViking	hmmm i dont think so
2007-04-30T13:39:00.000Z	zeroday	CheshireViking	lemme look card model again pls
2007-04-30T13:39:00.000Z	CheshireViking	zeroday	sorry, missed the nick out then - radeon xpress 200M
2007-04-30T13:40:00.000Z	zeroday	CheshireViking	check this out http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_feisty_beryl_ati_radeon
2007-04-30T13:40:00.000Z	CheshireViking	zeroday	thanks, i'll have a look
2007-04-30T13:41:00.000Z	zeroday	CheshireViking	no official driver for your card
2007-04-30T13:42:00.000Z	CheshireViking	zeroday	looking at that, it still suggests that there would be 2D support, I get a feeling that the laptop isn't going to be a sucessful install
2007-04-30T13:42:00.000Z	zeroday	CheshireViking	not with that card sorry its got really bad support
2007-04-30T13:42:00.000Z	zeroday	CheshireViking	NEVER EVER buy ati
2007-04-30T13:42:00.000Z	CheshireViking	zeroday	my other option will be to try a kubuntu live cd
2007-04-30T13:43:00.000Z	CheshireViking	zeroday	i always use nvidia, the laptop is my wifes, she's decided that she likes ubuntu & wanted me to install it on it for her
