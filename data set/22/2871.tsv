2010-03-26T09:11:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	I use VMware linux base withmany oses , you have a question?
2010-03-26T09:11:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	its very easy
2010-03-26T09:12:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	 you wont hurt windows by playing with VMware
2010-03-26T09:12:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	its all contained
2010-03-26T09:12:00.000Z	DrDank	vVvHACKERvVv	since im using it on vmware, will i still be able to do it as if it was installed to the hard drive?
2010-03-26T09:12:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	only thing is that on windows, VMWare disables autoplay from CD devices
2010-03-26T09:13:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	yes it created a virtual disk
2010-03-26T09:13:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	works the exact same way
2010-03-26T09:13:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	you can
2010-03-26T09:14:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	just a word of caution, do not draag VM machine running to seconday desktop
2010-03-26T09:15:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	run xchat don't use Mirc
2010-03-26T09:16:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	it's an insult to run mIRC when xchat is there
2010-03-26T09:16:00.000Z	DrDank	vVvHACKERvVv	yeah but the scripting is probably so much different, if it even supports scripting
2010-03-26T09:17:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	better to learn Python or Perl for scripting
2010-03-26T09:18:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	if you are going to learn linux, use linux tools, make yourself learn it do not rely on windows
2010-03-26T09:19:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	no, you have now taken a step to a real programming language,
2010-03-26T09:19:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	take some PERL tutorials
2010-03-26T09:20:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	then use python, python plugin for xchat is great
2010-03-26T09:21:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	VmWare will remember its closing position
2010-03-26T09:23:00.000Z	DrDank	vVvHACKERvVv	thats soon to come ;)
2010-03-26T09:24:00.000Z	vVvHACKERvVv	DrDank	once you understand what lInux is you will be able to make a better decision
