2010-01-16T15:55:00.000Z	lanoxx		hi, i have an ntfs partition mounted and everytime i delete a file it is copied to /<ntfs-root-folder>/.Trash-1000
2010-01-16T15:55:00.000Z	lanoxx		but if i empty the trash in nautilus then nothing gets removed from there
2010-01-16T15:55:00.000Z	lanoxx		do i have to empty this folder by my self?
2010-01-16T15:56:00.000Z	lanoxx		or is there another way?
2010-01-16T15:56:00.000Z	Andorin	lanoxx	I think so. That's what I've had to do before.
2010-01-16T15:56:00.000Z	lanoxx	Andorin	so i just remove the whole folder or just its subfolders? I was a bit confused because there are two subfolders info and files
2010-01-16T15:57:00.000Z	Andorin	lanoxx	I never tried just deleting .Trash-1000... I go through the folders until I find the files themselves, or their parent directories, and just erase those.
2010-01-16T15:58:00.000Z	lanoxx	Andorin	hmm, my .Trash-1000 is already about 8.8 gb
2010-01-16T15:58:00.000Z	lanoxx	Andorin	 deleting each file by hand might be a bit of work
2010-01-16T15:58:00.000Z	lanoxx	Andorin	do you thing its save to just delete the contents of info and files?
2010-01-16T15:59:00.000Z	Andorin	lanoxx	What do you see in .Trash-1000/files?
2010-01-16T16:00:00.000Z	lanoxx	Andorin	hundreds of files
2010-01-16T16:01:00.000Z	Andorin	lanoxx	Ctrl+A and hit Delete
2010-01-16T16:01:00.000Z	lanoxx	Andorin	what about the info folder?
2010-01-16T16:01:00.000Z	Andorin	lanoxx	How big is the folder?
2010-01-16T16:07:00.000Z	Andorin	lanoxx	Any luck?
2010-01-16T16:08:00.000Z	lanoxx	Andorin	yeah files are gone now
2010-01-16T16:09:00.000Z	Andorin	lanoxx	Great. It's weird that it doesn't ask to clear the trash on that partition when you unmount the partition... it's what the storage partition on my HD, and now my portable hard drive, do.
2010-01-16T16:10:00.000Z	lanoxx	Andorin	yeah thats strange
2010-01-16T16:11:00.000Z	lanoxx	Andorin	they look like this on the terminal: -????????? ? ?               ?        ?                ? duplicates.txt.trashinfo
2010-01-16T16:11:00.000Z	Andorin	lanoxx	Strange. When I delete a file from /files the relevant files in /info gets deleted too.
2010-01-16T16:13:00.000Z	lanoxx	Andorin	im going to boot xp and run chkdsk
