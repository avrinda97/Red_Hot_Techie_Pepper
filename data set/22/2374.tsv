2009-07-02T14:44:00.000Z	u_dparte	edgarmattern	this might not be preferable for you but if that was my box I'd nuke it and reinstall
2009-07-02T14:44:00.000Z	u_dparte		sounds like you've got some corrupt blocks on your HD
2009-07-02T14:45:00.000Z	u_dparte		hey psycolizard ... i had something similiar happen to me several months back ... not quite the same
2009-07-02T14:45:00.000Z	u_dparte		but I couldn't run an install
2009-07-02T14:46:00.000Z	u_dparte		turned out .. for some reason my bios had a floppy drive enabled which I didn't have one ... that was causing the ubuntu install to crash
2009-07-02T14:47:00.000Z	edgarmattern	u_dparte	what can i do?
2009-07-02T14:48:00.000Z	u_dparte	edgarmattern	that's beyond me without pysically being at the computer or being able to pull the hd ... you can boot up into safe mode and check your file system, but I don't know if that would work tbo
2009-07-02T14:49:00.000Z	edgarmattern	u_dparte	after check file system nothing happend...
2009-07-02T14:49:00.000Z	edgarmattern	u_dparte	thx...
2009-07-02T14:49:00.000Z	u_dparte	edgarmattern	sorry don't know what to tell you ... maybe there's someone else around w/ more experience w/ things like this
