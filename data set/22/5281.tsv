2010-01-21T06:07:00.000Z	flootenkerp		Hi, I'm not clear on how to upgrade my firefox to 3.5.7. Could someone tell me how?
2010-01-21T06:08:00.000Z	flootenkerp		I heard it was faster
2010-01-21T06:08:00.000Z	flootenkerp		Why? Is there something wrong with the beta?
2010-01-21T06:09:00.000Z	flootenkerp		I did
2010-01-21T06:09:00.000Z	flootenkerp		Videos run like crap for me
2010-01-21T06:09:00.000Z	flootenkerp		Firefox runs them amazing for me
2010-01-21T06:09:00.000Z	flootenkerp		How do I install it?
2010-01-21T06:09:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	flootenkerp	in karmic firefox is 3.5.7 already
2010-01-21T06:09:00.000Z	flootenkerp		I'm using hjaunty
2010-01-21T06:09:00.000Z	flootenkerp		jaunty*
2010-01-21T06:10:00.000Z	flootenkerp		So run the firefox application and it'll just start up?
2010-01-21T06:10:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	flootenkerp	ah, possibly a ppa from mozilla?
2010-01-21T06:11:00.000Z	flootenkerp		After I did that, it didn't have the plugins.
2010-01-21T06:12:00.000Z	flootenkerp	Dr_Willis	when I extract it, and run firefox, it opens up and is upgraded, but the plugins aren't there
2010-01-21T06:13:00.000Z	flootenkerp		And it doesn't update my current firefox.
2010-01-21T06:13:00.000Z	flootenkerp		I mean things like flash player
2010-01-21T06:13:00.000Z	flootenkerp		Those plugins
2010-01-21T06:13:00.000Z	flootenkerp		They aren't there. Is there a specific folder I need to extract it too?
2010-01-21T06:17:00.000Z	flootenkerp		How do I go about updating firefox to its latest version while keeping my plugins?
2010-01-21T06:18:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	flootenkerp	the plugins need to be made for that version. a newer version of firefox will mean a newer version for the plugins
2010-01-21T06:18:00.000Z	flootenkerp		I'm using 64 bit ubuntu if that makes a difference
2010-01-21T06:18:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	flootenkerp	not at all.
