2007-02-21T09:28:00.000Z	Farnaby		ElephantHunter| no
2007-02-21T09:28:00.000Z	Farnaby		I need another beer
2007-02-21T09:30:00.000Z	Farnaby		ElephantHunter| you are the only one I am using nick completion with since there are about 950 users and you have the longest name ;) But sometimes I miss the key ;)
2007-02-21T09:31:00.000Z	Farnaby		Earthen: I hear that
2007-02-21T09:31:00.000Z	Farnaby		I think that most people here are what, 12 ;)
2007-02-21T09:32:00.000Z	Farnaby		cmp1988| I need it for work and I need to be able to synch it here so its actually neccesary for me. I will probably upgrade sooner rather then later though
2007-02-21T09:32:00.000Z	Farnaby		cmp1988| There is that part too....
2007-02-21T09:34:00.000Z	Farnaby		cmp1988| I love edgy but I like to move forward as well. I will wait till its stable, wait to hear about palms, and then probably go for it. I don't mind beta testing too much since my work computer is a winXP machine and I can synch there if needed
2007-02-21T09:35:00.000Z	Farnaby		eleventyseven| its worth getting used to. Ubuntu is the first distro I have seen that is truly userfriendly
2007-02-21T09:37:00.000Z	Farnaby		so are there any evolution gurus in here?
2007-02-21T09:37:00.000Z	Pelo	Farnaby	 what are you trying to do ?
2007-02-21T09:38:00.000Z	Farnaby	Pelo	The tasks are showing as completed in evolution and hiding as I have marked. In the clock applet they are showing as completed but not hiding. This happaned after i upgraded my palm pilot to a new model
2007-02-21T09:38:00.000Z	Farnaby		linuxuser2907| what version, edgy, dapper, fiesty?
2007-02-21T09:38:00.000Z	Pelo	Farnaby	 I can't help but maybe someone else can , now that you have stated the problem
2007-02-21T09:39:00.000Z	Pelo		#evolution
2007-02-21T09:39:00.000Z	Farnaby		pelo: stated it a few times already ;)
2007-02-21T09:39:00.000Z	Pelo	Farnaby	 sorry
2007-02-21T09:39:00.000Z	Farnaby		And #evolution is rather empty ;)(
2007-02-21T09:40:00.000Z	Pelo	Farnaby	 yeah, I was chekcing it a few moments ago
2007-02-21T09:40:00.000Z	Farnaby		pelo: no worries. I just prefer to keep completed tasks around for a month or two but with the clock applet not hiding them... rather cluttered
2007-02-21T09:40:00.000Z	Farnaby		pelo: unusable cluttered actually. Since I tend to set tasks for most things since I am forgetfult
2007-02-21T09:41:00.000Z	Pelo	Farnaby	 I am trying to locate help for you , bare with me
