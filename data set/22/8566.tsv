2005-07-14T08:31:00.000Z	eno		hi, um.... how do I change the settings in gnome so that the active window is the one the mouse is over?  (like the olds days)
2005-07-14T08:32:00.000Z	djm62	eno	that's window manager behaviour
2005-07-14T09:50:00.000Z	djm62	eno	it lies underneath both
2005-07-14T09:50:00.000Z	djm62	eno	it is the blackboard, they are the diagrams
2005-07-14T09:51:00.000Z	djm62	eno	eventually you will understand why it's called a "server"...then your soul will be lost ;)
2005-07-14T09:52:00.000Z	djm62	eno	it's an old, old system with some odd nooks about it, but it has lasted well
2005-07-14T09:53:00.000Z	djm62	eno	the X server is the only application which touches the screen.  All other programs tell X what to draw
2005-07-14T09:58:00.000Z	djm62	eno	you might not need it, but it surely is cool
2005-07-14T09:54:00.000Z	djm62	eno	if you /just/ ran X. (and you can do this) you'd get a mouse pointer and a blank screen with grey hatching
2005-07-14T09:55:00.000Z	djm62	eno	otherwise, when you login you can change the "session" before you put in your name and password
2005-07-14T09:55:00.000Z	djm62	eno	and you can change to anything you like
2005-07-14T09:55:00.000Z	djm62	eno	I have a soft spot for blackbox and fluxbox as window managers
2005-07-14T09:56:00.000Z	djm62	eno	just log out of gnome without shutting down, but make sure you have installed some of the other window managers
2005-07-14T09:58:00.000Z	djm62	eno	and try to get a shot of ssh X-forwarding...
2005-07-14T09:59:00.000Z	djm62	eno	yeah, but windows doesn't run X-window-system
2005-07-14T10:00:00.000Z	djm62	eno	yep
2005-07-14T10:01:00.000Z	djm62	eno	you can have good fun getting it to talk to your SO if he/she's at home
2005-07-14T10:01:00.000Z	eno	djm62	yeah I could install one of those talker programs and make it say things :P
2005-07-14T10:02:00.000Z	djm62	eno	I went with "why won't you stop playing solitaire?" ;)
2005-07-14T10:06:00.000Z	djm62	eno	I can't remember the exact incantation, I think /usr/share/doc/festival/ has a quick-start guide inside it
2005-07-14T10:06:00.000Z	djm62	eno	in general, there are some goodies to be found in /usr/share/doc/<packagename>
2005-07-14T10:07:00.000Z	djm62	eno	for X stuff, you're best to learn by playing...I'm off to bed now, have fun
