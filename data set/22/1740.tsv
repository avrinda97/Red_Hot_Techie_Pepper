2011-10-21T08:56:00.000Z	sinatrajk		is this chat actually useful? or should i just keep doing a google search?
2011-10-21T08:56:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	how is it crashing, what is current, what browser.
2011-10-21T08:56:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	the more info, the more likely you get help
2011-10-21T08:57:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	what version of flash, hwo did you install it?
2011-10-21T08:57:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	also, again, what browsers? Chrome bundles it's own Flash player, for example.
2011-10-21T08:58:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	interesting.
2011-10-21T08:59:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	does it crash on *everything* or are you only trying a specific site?
2011-10-21T08:59:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	uh... what "flash settings" ?
2011-10-21T09:00:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	the browser locks up? or just the flash applet where the settings thingy loads into?
2011-10-21T09:00:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	what arch are you on?
2011-10-21T09:01:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	what iso did you download?
2011-10-21T09:03:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	hm, I'm not sure... let me do a bit of looking at something real fast.
2011-10-21T09:04:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	what PPA did you enable to install flash?
2011-10-21T09:05:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	that was my bad, I forgot it's in the repos now.
2011-10-21T09:05:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	I'm not really sure how to help you... you probably ought to try running it in a command line shell to see if you can see the crash message.
2011-10-21T09:06:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	the only other suggestion I have is a PPA that might have a slightly newer version, but that may simply exacerbate the problem.
2011-10-21T09:06:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	close all of your Firefox windows.
2011-10-21T09:06:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	then open `gnome-terminal`. Type "firefox" and then go to the flash page. See if anything useful prints in the terminal
2011-10-21T09:23:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	I assume it's a flash tar.gz?
2011-10-21T09:24:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	I would recommend removing the flash you have installed and seeking out a PPA from "seven machines". It has a very up-to-date copy of flash 11.
2011-10-21T09:28:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	based on what sagarchalise is telling me and a quick check of version numbers... you're best off with the flash you had installed before.
2011-10-21T09:28:00.000Z	magn3ts	sinatrajk	I don't know why it doesn't work, I'm very sorry.
