2005-07-22T14:21:00.000Z	bigfoot1		hello all: http://www.banja.com/login.asp shows  a flash page. I can click the buttons, but I can't enter text in it. Is this a problem just with my computer?
2005-07-22T14:23:00.000Z	bigfoot1		About http://www.banja.com/login.asp, I _can_ enter text, but it's invisible. What's up?
2005-07-22T14:24:00.000Z	The_Vox	bigfoot1	are you using the "official" flash plugin or the Free one that comes with ubuntu?
2005-07-22T14:24:00.000Z	bigfoot1	The_Vox	how can i check?
2005-07-22T14:24:00.000Z	The_Vox	bigfoot1	how did you install flash?
2005-07-22T14:24:00.000Z	bigfoot1	The_Vox	i forgot.
2005-07-22T14:25:00.000Z	bigfoot1	The_Vox	how can i confirm which flash i have?
2005-07-22T14:25:00.000Z	The_Vox	bigfoot1	open firefox, type "about:plugins" (no quotes) in the addressbar and look for the flash plugin description...tell me what it says
2005-07-22T14:26:00.000Z	bigfoot1	The_Vox	    File name: libflashplayer.so    Shockwave Flash 7.0 r25
2005-07-22T14:27:00.000Z	bigfoot1	The_Vox	application/x-shockwave-flash  Shockwave Flash  swf ..

2005-07-22T14:27:00.000Z	The_Vox	bigfoot1	uhm...that's the official one....it shouldn't be all that unstable....then again, I rarely use it, I have an extension blocking display of flash until/unless I want to display it
2005-07-22T14:27:00.000Z	bigfoot1	The_Vox	can you go to http://www.banja.com/login.asp and tell me if you can see the text you enter?
2005-07-22T14:29:00.000Z	The_Vox	bigfoot1	can't see the text, no
2005-07-22T14:29:00.000Z	bigfoot1	The_Vox	you mean you can't see the text that you enter with your keyboard, right?
2005-07-22T14:29:00.000Z	The_Vox	bigfoot1	right, nor in the user nor password fields
2005-07-22T14:30:00.000Z	bigfoot1	The_Vox	so what's wrong?
2005-07-22T14:30:00.000Z	The_Vox	bigfoot1	badly made flash animation would be my guess...they must be using something that is windows-specific
2005-07-22T14:31:00.000Z	bigfoot1	The_Vox	i see. there's no way we can solve this on ubuntu computers, is there?
2005-07-22T14:32:00.000Z	The_Vox	bigfoot1	don't think there is, no
2005-07-22T14:32:00.000Z	bigfoot1	The_Vox	okay. I guess we just have to avoid sites like that.
2005-07-22T14:32:00.000Z	The_Vox	bigfoot1	and send an email to the webmaster telling him why
