2010-03-02T17:22:00.000Z	swiftarrow		Hi all, I have a problem, and it seems to be rather obscure, since I can't find a solution via Google :O   Here it is:  I'm trying to install FreeCAD, which depends on python-pivy, which depends on libqt4-opengl_4.5.3   The problem is that the latest version in the repos is only 4.5.0, so I can't install python-pivy.  I've got the debs for 4.5.3 from the debian repos, but when I install them, synaptic says half my other programs are broken and wants
2010-03-02T17:22:00.000Z	swiftarrow		 to remove them before doing anything else...  Any ideas?  TIA!
2010-03-02T17:24:00.000Z	acicula	swiftarrow	paste output on pastebin, such packages can sometime remove a lib that stuff depends on
2010-03-02T17:30:00.000Z	acicula	swiftarrow	a solution was given, build (a deb) from source, find a ppa where it is prepackaged or find someone to packege it for you
2010-03-02T17:48:00.000Z	acicula	swiftarrow	you can probably get away with grabbing the deb descriptor of the original package lib and updating it for your new one
2010-03-02T17:38:00.000Z	swiftarrow	acicula	Thanks for your reply.  I _Already have_ the packages to install the latest ones, but when I install the latest version, synaptic says that my other software has broken dependancies (and doesn't give up until I restore the older versions).  I'm just upgrading a package, so is there a way for it to recognize that?
2010-03-02T17:39:00.000Z	swiftarrow	acicula	I'm installing via dpkg, not via repos.  I've only found debian repos to have this package
2010-03-02T17:39:00.000Z	acicula	swiftarrow	you cannot selectively upgrade a package within a disribution, nor mixin random debs and expect it to work, thats not how a distribution works unfortunatly
2010-03-02T17:40:00.000Z	swiftarrow	acicula	but if I had synaptic get the upgraded libs via some repo all would be fine?
2010-03-02T17:41:00.000Z	acicula	swiftarrow	well repos as in ppa can work, but it depends on how well the ppa packages are maintained, but typically it should solve the depencies
2010-03-02T17:42:00.000Z	swiftarrow	acicula	I've already resolved the dependancies for the upgrades.  it's my existing software that complains of being broken, but this is just a minor version change.  Let's say I just force install them, would it be catastrophic?
2010-03-02T17:43:00.000Z	acicula	swiftarrow	well the software is build against a lib of say version 1.0.1, and you force it to work with 1.0.2, it will probably work, but it also breaks the dependency system, as far as that goes it will now think there is no 1.0.1 library anymore since you are forcing stuff
2010-03-02T17:44:00.000Z	acicula	swiftarrow	so short answer yes it may work, and yes you can forcibly install debs that are not packaged for your distribution, but well you take a risk in doing so
2010-03-02T17:44:00.000Z	swiftarrow	acicula	is there a way to make it think that the 4.5.0 is still installed? sym links or something?  (grey area for me)
2010-03-02T17:45:00.000Z	acicula	swiftarrow	dependencies are maintained in apt itself
2010-03-02T17:46:00.000Z	swiftarrow	acicula	right, I've had to do that before...   well, I guess I'll just try it and see.  downgrading again isn't hard.  Thanks for your time!
2010-03-02T17:46:00.000Z	acicula	swiftarrow	i'd just grab the source and dunk it in your home or /locl
2010-03-02T17:46:00.000Z	swiftarrow	acicula	but then the program that depends on that would also need to be altered to look in that place, right?
2010-03-02T17:47:00.000Z	acicula	swiftarrow	LD_LIBRARY_PATH
2010-03-02T17:47:00.000Z	swiftarrow	acicula	never heard of it :)  Hmmm....
2010-03-02T17:48:00.000Z	swiftarrow	acicula	Ok, I'll go look there.  thanks!
2010-03-02T18:20:00.000Z	swiftarrow	acicula	I couldn't find any way to do it, so now I'm installing it on my other computer which runs karmic.  Don't know why I didn't do that before.
