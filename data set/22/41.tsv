2012-10-10T08:07:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		nightcrab:change bios to AHCI
2012-10-10T08:07:00.000Z	nightcrab	lotuspsychje	, unfortunately this bios doesn t have that option
2012-10-10T08:06:00.000Z	nightcrab	lotuspsychje	, i am trying to connect a ssd sata hard drive in to an old ide only motherboard
2012-10-10T08:09:00.000Z	nightcrab	lotuspsychje	, when trying to install ubuntu it crashes at installing system
2012-10-10T08:10:00.000Z	nightcrab	lotuspsychje	, i can see the hard drive on ubuntu but not in bios. no erros it simply freeze
2012-10-10T08:13:00.000Z	nightcrab	lotuspsychje	, i tryed with cd and usb live so i think the problemcames from the ssd hard drive. and what about the bios?
2012-10-10T08:15:00.000Z	nightcrab	lotuspsychje	, let suppose i could install xubuntu. what about the bios if i cant set the ssd to boot? thats why i would like to rsolve the bios problem first
2012-10-10T08:17:00.000Z	nightcrab	lotuspsychje	, but what would i choose as boot priority? bios has a try other boot devices option
2012-10-10T08:20:00.000Z	nightcrab	lotuspsychje	, you may have lots of hard drives pens cd rom connected to a computer but you ll have to choose one to boot it
2012-10-10T08:23:00.000Z	nightcrab	lotuspsychje	, your first answer was to choose AHCI, remember?
2012-10-10T08:24:00.000Z	nightcrab	lotuspsychje	, nothing appear to choose from to boot
2012-10-10T08:25:00.000Z	nightcrab	lotuspsychje	, i have no boot options
2012-10-10T08:27:00.000Z	nightcrab	lotuspsychje	, dont i?
2012-10-10T08:28:00.000Z	nightcrab	lotuspsychje	, using live usb. choosed usb boot in bios
2012-10-10T08:32:00.000Z	nightcrab	lotuspsychje	, when trying to install ubuntu it crashes at installing system
2012-10-10T08:34:00.000Z	nightcrab	lotuspsychje	, because i was talking to god
