2011-06-12T19:02:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Kruptein	What browser do you wish to use?
2011-06-12T19:02:00.000Z	Kruptein	rationalOgre	the default of the system
2011-06-12T19:03:00.000Z	Kruptein	rationalOgre	I don't want to force every user of my program to use one specific browser
2011-06-12T19:03:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Kruptein	Just use gnome-open then.
2011-06-12T19:03:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Kruptein	If you are making it Ubuntu specific
2011-06-12T19:04:00.000Z	Kruptein	rationalOgre	but if someone set to open a .html by default with a text-editor  gnome-open won't open the browser
2011-06-12T19:10:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Kruptein	On my xdg-open it ends up calling gnome-open anyway.
2011-06-12T19:10:00.000Z	Kruptein	rationalOgre	yes on my xdg too
2011-06-12T19:10:00.000Z	Kruptein	rationalOgre	but that's not my problem =D
2011-06-12T19:11:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Kruptein	Ok. So then what is it, cause all I saw was something about you wanting it to open the browser but it kept opening opera and you didn't know why.
2011-06-12T19:12:00.000Z	Kruptein	rationalOgre	no you jumped on too late :p   so I want to have a command-line option to open a local file in the default browser
2011-06-12T19:12:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Kruptein	So what happens when you pass it a file:// url?
2011-06-12T19:13:00.000Z	Kruptein	rationalOgre	if I pass a file to xdg-open or gnome-open  they will open it with the default program (which probably is an editor)  but I want to open it with the default browser
2011-06-12T19:15:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Kruptein	Just tested on my system. Opened with firefox.
2011-06-12T19:15:00.000Z	Kruptein	rationalOgre	what did you test exactly
2011-06-12T19:15:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Kruptein	Did it with an XML file, which is associated with VIM btw.
2011-06-12T19:15:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Kruptein	xdg-open file://~/settings.xml
2011-06-12T19:16:00.000Z	Kruptein	rationalOgre	also if I do  file:///home/kruptein/file.py
2011-06-12T19:17:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Kruptein	then xdg-open is the wrong thing, sorry. XDG open tries to figure out how to intelligently handle the file, not just open it in a browser.
2011-06-12T19:19:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Kruptein	Then detect the users browser settings and set it in your application.
2011-06-12T19:20:00.000Z	Kruptein	rationalOgre	that's my question indeed :p
2011-06-12T19:21:00.000Z	rationalOgre	Kruptein	So your question all along is, how do I detect the users browser settings on Ubuntu?
