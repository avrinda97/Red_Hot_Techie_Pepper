2007-10-05T13:54:00.000Z	Kronos		guyz... uhmm i finnaly seem to have installed it (ubuntu 7.04) without the swapp partition the only thing i tought was strange during the instalation was it hangged at 6% on the copying files screen for about 10 mins... and then it just jumped straight to 18% but after that everything went smooth, now (after it telling me to lose the CD coz its about to restart) it restarts time after time .. the orange bar underneath u
2007-10-05T13:54:00.000Z	Kronos		buntu's logo goes to roughtly 95% and then it restarts for no reason, does it time after time after time... i just got into the kernel safe mode and that seems to be ok but i have no clue as to what's going on since i never used this before ... >>>HELP PLEASE!!!!<<<
2007-10-05T13:55:00.000Z	MrObvious	Kronos	You didn't install with a swap?
2007-10-05T13:56:00.000Z	Kronos	MrObvious	nop i have 2GB of memory and some1 called Pskoll (i belive) said it would be ok with 2 GB of mem
2007-10-05T13:57:00.000Z	MrObvious	Kronos	You should still have a swap. At least install a 512MB swap. It still wont' hurt. I've used up to 1GB of swap on 512MB of RAM before and still wasn't done opening all my programs. I could probably easily use 2GB of RAM + some swap.
2007-10-05T13:58:00.000Z	MrObvious	Kronos	You might run Memtest as included on the Ubuntu CD to see if your memory is in good condition. I'd recommend a fresh install since you just did one with a swap partition. Make sure you give the partitions a good format so that it doesn't keep any data. That should get you off good provided you don't have any hardware problems. Also, you aren't needing special SATA or RAID drivers are you?
2007-10-05T13:58:00.000Z	Kronos	MrObvious	so u reckon i should install a swap? if so how big ... half the mem size? like 1 GB?...
2007-10-05T13:59:00.000Z	MrObvious	Kronos	512 will do IMO, but 1GB can't hurt just in case. Linux is smart with memory management.
2007-10-05T14:00:00.000Z	Kronos	MrObvious	right no... i  mean i've got a single disk atm... sata yes but just standard nothing fancy... mem... yeh ok i can run some tests but i'm pretty sure its good its some pretty high quality stuff as far as the system goes it was runing 100% yesterday i had windows on and all my stuff worked 100%
2007-10-05T14:01:00.000Z	Kronos	MrObvious	well as good as anything can run on windows =D
2007-10-05T14:02:00.000Z	MrObvious	Kronos	Hmm okay. IDK why it would be holding up, unless there are graphics drivers problems. You might check the syslog.
2007-10-05T14:04:00.000Z	Kronos	MrObvious	yes yes yes... my graphics card is pretty good but its a bit of a funny one its known for that, and when i was trying to install ubuntu with the desktop instalation disk its keept messing up on the loading screen (after u press install on the screen where u get a little bar going back and forth) then i was recomended to get the "alternate" version which is what i'm using now
2007-10-05T14:05:00.000Z	MrObvious	Kronos	What is your GPU?
2007-10-05T14:05:00.000Z	MrObvious	Kronos	And are you running an overclock of any kind?
2007-10-05T14:07:00.000Z	Kronos	MrObvious	gainward 6800GS AGP 512 MB  (this is technicly a PCIe jobbie with a PCIe to AGP converter thing, and what i mean by funny is that they "never" released any 512 MB version on AGP... so this is some wired very limited version...
2007-10-05T14:07:00.000Z	Kronos	MrObvious	no overclocks
2007-10-05T14:08:00.000Z	MrObvious	Kronos	Hmm odd. Try what I suggested and see if that works then.
2007-10-05T14:09:00.000Z	Kronos	MrObvious	ok ty i'm doing the mem test just in case then if it all passes fine i'm gonna install it again with a 1GB swap just to see what happens, i'll keep u on tell and talk to u when its done, easyer than telling some1 else all about the problem again... thank you again...
2007-10-05T14:10:00.000Z	MrObvious	Kronos	I'm really out of suggestions actually.
2007-10-05T14:10:00.000Z	MrObvious	Kronos	So if this doesn't work more than likely someone with graphics experience can help you.
2007-10-05T14:10:00.000Z	Kronos	MrObvious	alrighty,  can doo thank you for the help anyway...
2007-10-05T14:10:00.000Z	MrObvious	Kronos	:)
