2006-05-12T09:22:00.000Z	_jason	theorem	maybe, what problem are you having?
2006-05-12T09:23:00.000Z	theorem	_jason	i down graded from gcc 4 to gcc 3.4.6
2006-05-12T09:23:00.000Z	theorem	_jason	so that i could build drivers for my Nforce4 mother board
2006-05-12T09:23:00.000Z	theorem	_jason	it went well, when i type gcc -ver it sais i have 3.4.6
2006-05-12T09:24:00.000Z	_jason	theorem	there's no need to downgrade, you can have both versions side-by-side
2006-05-12T09:24:00.000Z	theorem	_jason	ver 4 is still ther
2006-05-12T09:25:00.000Z	theorem	_jason	but the nvidea installer sees only the newer version
2006-05-12T09:25:00.000Z	theorem	_jason	how can i make it build the driver using version 3.4.6
2006-05-12T09:25:00.000Z	_jason	theorem	ok, do you specifically want to compile instead of using the ubuntu provided drivers?
2006-05-12T09:26:00.000Z	theorem		yes
2006-05-12T09:26:00.000Z	_jason	theorem	try this before configuring: export CC=gcc-3.4
2006-05-12T09:26:00.000Z	theorem	_jason	gcc-3.4 like that or gcc-3.4.6
2006-05-12T09:41:00.000Z	theorem	_jason	export CC=gcc-3.4 did not work
2006-05-12T09:41:00.000Z	_jason	theorem	how did you go about downgrading to gcc-3.4?
2006-05-12T09:42:00.000Z	_jason		!language
2006-05-12T09:43:00.000Z	theorem	_jason	i didnt downgrade
2006-05-12T09:43:00.000Z	_jason	theorem	did you just install gcc-3.4 from the repositories?
2006-05-12T09:43:00.000Z	theorem	_jason	i just downloaded version 3.4.6 then unpacked it
2006-05-12T09:43:00.000Z	theorem	_jason	no
2006-05-12T09:44:00.000Z	_jason	theorem	maybe you will have better luck if you use gcc-3.4 from the repositories
2006-05-12T09:44:00.000Z	theorem	_jason	i configured & made with ver 4
