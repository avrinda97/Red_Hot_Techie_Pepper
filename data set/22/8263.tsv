2005-09-30T05:26:00.000Z	Brunellus		how would I do that?
2005-09-30T05:27:00.000Z	Brunellus		well, here's the funny thing
2005-09-30T05:27:00.000Z	Brunellus		I'm running another wireless host on the same network
2005-09-30T05:27:00.000Z	Brunellus		and it connects to 192.168.2.1 just fine with the netmask at 255.255.255.0
2005-09-30T05:29:00.000Z	Brunellus		I can ping the 192.168.2.1 router from here
2005-09-30T05:29:00.000Z	Brunellus		this host?
2005-09-30T05:30:00.000Z	Brunellus		192.168.2.138
2005-09-30T05:31:00.000Z	Brunellus		right Janboel.  my problem is the *other* computer, which is trying to pull an IP from the router at 192.168.2.1
2005-09-30T05:32:00.000Z	Brunellus		ok.  so after some googling
2005-09-30T05:32:00.000Z	Brunellus		I'm thinking it might be a route problem
2005-09-30T05:33:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	Brunellus	what's the problem? I had a route problem...
2005-09-30T13:00:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	Brunellus	try sudo route add default gw 192.168.2.1
2005-09-30T13:00:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	Brunellus	That just magically worked? Wow
2005-09-30T13:02:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	Brunellus	I didn't look at the pastebin though
2005-09-30T13:06:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	Brunellus	Does ifconfig show you the IP of the adapter?
2005-09-30T13:07:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	Brunellus	ifconfig <adapter> 192.168.2.<chooseme>
2005-09-30T13:07:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	Brunellus	sudo dhclient
2005-09-30T13:08:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	Brunellus	DHCP over WLAN didn't work for me on Ubuntu
2005-09-30T13:15:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	Brunellus	What's up now?
2005-09-30T13:20:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	Brunellus	You do... you do you do you do
2005-09-30T13:22:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	Brunellus	search synaptic for dhcp server
2005-09-30T13:26:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	Brunellus	try searching name and description
