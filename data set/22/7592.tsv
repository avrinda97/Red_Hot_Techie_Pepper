2006-02-25T12:00:00.000Z	warpzone		pardon, I've mounted a windows hard drive using ntfs, set the owner and chmod'ed to all read/write, yet I kee getting "permission denied" when I try to access it
2006-02-25T12:00:00.000Z	warpzone		anybody have a few mins to help?
2006-02-25T12:00:00.000Z	chris_	warpzone	ntfs is read only in linux.  read write support is extremely experimental
2006-02-25T12:02:00.000Z	warpzone	chris_	should I chmod them all to read only? Could that be causing an error to make it inaccessible?
2006-02-25T12:04:00.000Z	chris_	warpzone	I get the same here.  Do a sudo bash then try to go into your mount point, can you see the files now?
2006-02-25T12:07:00.000Z	warpzone	chris_	yeah, I can get in as root. Is there a special way I have to set permission for ntfs?
2006-02-25T12:07:00.000Z	chris_	warpzone	hang on i'll try it on mine
2006-02-25T12:07:00.000Z	warpzone	chris_	cool, thanks for the help man
2006-02-25T12:11:00.000Z	chris_	warpzone	me too.  i can mount it now as myself but no access.
2006-02-25T12:16:00.000Z	chris_	warpzone	ok unmount, edit /etc/fstab, add users,ro,umask=000 to the line where it said defaults.
2006-02-25T12:20:00.000Z	chris_	warpzone	paste me the whole line from /etc/fstab
2006-02-25T12:22:00.000Z	chris_	warpzone	OK. remove the defaults, add owner and change the 1's to 0's
2006-02-25T12:23:00.000Z	chris_	warpzone	mine looks like this /dev/hda1       /windows        ntfs    users,ro,owner,umask=000        0 0
2006-02-25T12:24:00.000Z	warpzone	chris_	by "add owner" do you mena just write 'owner' in the options line or something different
2006-02-25T12:25:00.000Z	chris_	warpzone	like mine:- /dev/hda1       /windows        ntfs    users,ro,owner,umask=000        0 0
2006-02-25T12:25:00.000Z	chris_	warpzone	Steep learning curve mate.  Stick with it.  I'm still new too.
2006-02-25T12:29:00.000Z	chris_	warpzone	how you doing there?
2006-02-25T12:31:00.000Z	chris_	warpzone	no need to chown
2006-02-25T12:32:00.000Z	chris_	warpzone	you can't change anything on this partition, just read the data.  You should be able to see the files now, as well as mount it as your user without the sudo
2006-02-25T12:33:00.000Z	warpzone	chris_	can't even type ls /windows, get premission denied :-P
2006-02-25T12:35:00.000Z	chris_	warpzone	hmm, it works for me!
2006-02-25T12:37:00.000Z	chris_	warpzone	no probs mate
