2012-10-31T16:36:00.000Z	Orochikaku		Erm, so can anyone help me out? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1320638/
2012-10-31T16:37:00.000Z	iceroot	Orochikaku	i dont see a real question
2012-10-31T16:37:00.000Z	iceroot	Orochikaku	we dont know what you want to do with the system
2012-10-31T16:37:00.000Z	iceroot	Orochikaku	500gb for ubuntu only? then use the default from the installer
2012-10-31T16:38:00.000Z	Orochikaku	iceroot	well when I try install ubuntu it says you don't have a boot drive selected and asks me to setup partitions, bieng this is the first time I have ever mingled out of NFTS its scaring me, online guides tell me I need a SWAP (IDK what that is either).
2012-10-31T16:47:00.000Z	Orochikaku	iceroot	is there anyway I could setup screen sharing?
2012-10-31T18:18:00.000Z	iceroot	Orochikaku	still installing? then use amd64 instead if you have more then 1gb ram
2012-10-31T18:19:00.000Z	iceroot	Orochikaku	i would suggest to install amd64 if your cpu is able to do it and not install i386
2012-10-31T18:20:00.000Z	iceroot	Orochikaku	you cant upgrade, you have to reinstall to switch to amd64, because of that its always a good idea to use amd64 directly if the cpu is able to do it
2012-10-31T18:21:00.000Z	iceroot	Orochikaku	then you MUST install amd64 to use all the ram
2012-10-31T18:22:00.000Z	Orochikaku	iceroot	REALLY?! Linux does that bullshit too? Where it stops using ram when your using 32bit
2012-10-31T18:22:00.000Z	iceroot	Orochikaku	that has nothing to do with linux
2012-10-31T18:23:00.000Z	iceroot	Orochikaku	it has to do with math
2012-10-31T18:25:00.000Z	iceroot	Orochikaku	if you are not in the part"resizing/formating the hdd" you can just restart the system
2012-10-31T18:26:00.000Z	iceroot	Orochikaku	ah you are installing on a usb drive
2012-10-31T18:26:00.000Z	iceroot	Orochikaku	and want to start it on different systems
2012-10-31T18:27:00.000Z	iceroot	Orochikaku	then use i386 if you want to use it on 32bit systems too
2012-10-31T18:27:00.000Z	Orochikaku	iceroot	 got it.
