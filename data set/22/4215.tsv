2008-02-17T09:59:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn		klownish1: Ok.. it doesn't offer an access control?
2008-02-17T09:59:00.000Z	klownish	FourX4Luvn	no, not at all.
2008-02-17T09:59:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	klownish	For the NFS portion
2008-02-17T10:00:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	klownish	Wow.. I would of thought they all would have some sort of ACL for security purposes.  Afraid I have no idea then, sorry.
2008-02-17T10:01:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	klownish	Wait.. that could be it.. Is it being exported as CIFS and not NFS perhaps?  have you tried to smbmount it?
2008-02-17T10:01:00.000Z	klownish	FourX4Luvn	it gives me the option for both
2008-02-17T10:02:00.000Z	klownish	FourX4Luvn	both of them are checked at the moment
2008-02-17T10:02:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	klownish	Just for giggles, try to SMB mount it then.  Perhaps it uses some screwed up NFS protocol
2008-02-17T10:03:00.000Z	klownish	FourX4Luvn	im kinda new to all this, mind giving me a quick runthrew of smb?
2008-02-17T10:04:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	klownish	Hrm.. have to give me a minute then.. I dont' recall how to smbmount for sure

2008-02-17T10:09:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	klownish	Did you get my link?  Did it work?  Are ya dead?
2008-02-17T10:11:00.000Z	klownish	FourX4Luvn	its telling me incorrect fs type.
2008-02-17T10:12:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	klownish	Did you try smbfs or cifs?
2008-02-17T10:12:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	klownish	Try smbfs
2008-02-17T10:13:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	klownish	smbfs is deprecated on Linux.. but the NAS may still use that type.
2008-02-17T10:15:00.000Z	klownish	FourX4Luvn	its giving me the same error
2008-02-17T10:15:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	klownish	Ok.. What is the make and model of the NAS?
2008-02-17T10:17:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	klownish	Ok.. brb
2008-02-17T10:24:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	klownish	Well, I found at least one person that had your problem after they upgraded to Gutsy.  So it may be an issue with Gutsy, though I can't find any other information about it.  The closest I found was this:  http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2007/01/13/using-western-digital-netcenter-with-ubuntu-linux/
2008-02-17T10:26:00.000Z	klownish	FourX4Luvn	thx for the help, i tried that page earlier, with no help.
2008-02-17T10:26:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	klownish	Ok.. then I'm fresh out of ideas, sorry mate.
