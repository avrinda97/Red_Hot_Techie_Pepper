2010-07-03T08:29:00.000Z	MaRk-I	spiol78	you already checked in aircrack-ng room? maybe your cards are stuck in raw mode
2010-07-03T08:30:00.000Z	spiol78	MaRk-I	- raw mode ... I need to look into that
2010-07-03T08:32:00.000Z	spiol78	MaRk-I	- I am googling raw mode... thanks for the tip
2010-07-03T08:33:00.000Z	MaRk-I	spiol78	yw just a hunch
2010-07-03T08:37:00.000Z	spiol78	MaRk-I	- do you think this will help???  http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airdriver-ng  MaRk-I
2010-07-03T08:38:00.000Z	MaRk-I	spiol78	you know when you typed (i.e. airmon-ng wlan0 start), do the opposite like airmon-ng wlan0 stop
2010-07-03T08:39:00.000Z	spiol78	MaRk-I	- I rebooted since then... that didn't help
2010-07-03T08:40:00.000Z	MaRk-I	spiol78	can you put it in monitor mode??
2010-07-03T08:40:00.000Z	spiol78	MaRk-I	- nope... the card is not found at all
2010-07-03T08:40:00.000Z	spiol78	MaRk-I	- nothing in ifconfig -a
2010-07-03T08:41:00.000Z	spiol78	MaRk-I	- My other partition doesn't even work!!!
2010-07-03T08:41:00.000Z	MaRk-I	spiol78	tried the livecd?
2010-07-03T08:42:00.000Z	spiol78	MaRk-I	- thought about that.... I haven't done it yet
2010-07-03T08:43:00.000Z	spiol78	MaRk-I	- trying the liveCD now
2010-07-03T08:43:00.000Z	MaRk-I	spiol78	good luck
2010-07-03T08:47:00.000Z	spiol78	MaRk-I	- WOW... THE CARD SHOWED UP
2010-07-03T08:47:00.000Z	MaRk-I	spiol78	I think it has to do because the card staid in "raw/monitor" mode
2010-07-03T08:48:00.000Z	spiol78	MaRk-I	- booted back into the install... it still doesn't work
2010-07-03T08:49:00.000Z	spiol78	MaRk-I	- I think you are right about raw/monitor mode
2010-07-03T08:50:00.000Z	MaRk-I	spiol78	only aricrack ppl might help, that's all I can think of sorry
2010-07-03T08:51:00.000Z	spiol78	MaRk-I	- thanks for the help... I think you have me going in the right direction
