2009-07-17T02:31:00.000Z	Bodsda	wizzo50	do you mean should you create a new partition for a virtual machine?
2009-07-17T02:32:00.000Z	wizzo50	Bodsda	I just downloaded Virtual Box and am setting it up to run Vista in Ubuntu
2009-07-17T02:32:00.000Z	wizzo50	Bodsda	Just new to me 1st time so I am not sure
2009-07-17T02:32:00.000Z	Bodsda	wizzo50	ok, im unsure what you meant by 'create a hard disk'
2009-07-17T02:33:00.000Z	wizzo50	Bodsda	It is asking me that
2009-07-17T02:33:00.000Z	Bodsda	wizzo50	what is the exact wording of the question?
2009-07-17T02:35:00.000Z	wizzo50	Bodsda	Create new Virtual Box  To load Windows in here
2009-07-17T02:36:00.000Z	Bodsda	wizzo50	yes, create a new virtualbox
2009-07-17T02:36:00.000Z	wizzo50	Bodsda	And then it is asking me what I told you already
2009-07-17T02:37:00.000Z	Bodsda	wizzo50	you want to create it as a fixed or dynamic file in the file path it has as default
2009-07-17T02:38:00.000Z	wizzo50	Bodsda	I just want to run my Windows Vista in here so I don't have to reboot to load Windows
2009-07-17T02:38:00.000Z	wizzo50	Bodsda	So, I don't know what you mean by what your asking?
2009-07-17T02:38:00.000Z	Bodsda	wizzo50	thats fine. What is the current question?
2009-07-17T02:39:00.000Z	wizzo50	Bodsda	I already asked you, how do you setup the VB to run Vista on here
2009-07-17T02:40:00.000Z	Bodsda	wizzo50	understood, but I have a bad memory, what is the setup asking you at this stage?
2009-07-17T02:41:00.000Z	wizzo50	Bodsda	COo! Coo! I already told you that too. Later!
2009-07-17T02:41:00.000Z	Bodsda	wizzo50	I'm not going to be able to help you unless you calm down and repeat the question that the setup is asking you
