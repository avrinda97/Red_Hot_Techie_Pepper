2007-12-03T02:15:00.000Z	PeterT		Apologies for repeating myself:  I have installed Ubuntu Studio on my hard disk, dual booting with Vista.  (Vista bootloader is configured to refer to linux partition (hd0,5) which contains the OS & grub installation).  It worked for a time, but now I get an error early on boot that it cannot mount (hd0,5).  It's possible that this problem appeared after attempting to use hibernate.  The volume mounts with no fuss in a live CD.  Can anyo
2007-12-03T02:15:00.000Z	PeterT		ne give me any pointers?
2007-12-03T02:16:00.000Z	digitori	PeterT	gimme a sec
2007-12-03T02:17:00.000Z	PeterT	digitori	thanks
2007-12-03T02:21:00.000Z	digitori	PeterT	read this article see if it helps http://www.pronetworks.org/forum/about78184.html
2007-12-03T02:21:00.000Z	PeterT	digitori	I did successfully install / dual boot
2007-12-03T02:22:00.000Z	PeterT	digitori	the problem emerged later, when everything seemed stable.
2007-12-03T02:22:00.000Z	PeterT	digitori	I'm reading the article now
2007-12-03T02:23:00.000Z	digitori	PeterT	possible that its to do with grub not being on mbr
2007-12-03T02:23:00.000Z	PeterT	digitori	sounds plausible
2007-12-03T02:24:00.000Z	digitori	PeterT	your using vista bootloader...go for a grub to mbr install.
2007-12-03T02:24:00.000Z	digitori	PeterT	I would be delighted to know your outcome.
2007-12-03T02:25:00.000Z	PeterT	digitori	I might try that, although it might break dell mediadirect (not sure how much I care about that, but I'd rather keep it)
2007-12-03T02:25:00.000Z	PeterT	digitori	it still doesn't explain why it stopped working when things were apparantly stable
2007-12-03T02:26:00.000Z	digitori	PeterT	erm does dell media direct run off of vista or has it a bootloader of sorts?
2007-12-03T02:26:00.000Z	PeterT	digitori	not entirely sure, hang on...
2007-12-03T02:27:00.000Z	digitori	PeterT	ah dell media direct is on its own partition...if you dont over write it youll be ok
2007-12-03T02:28:00.000Z	PeterT	digitori	I can probably test before doing anything drastic, but regardless of the fact that it's on it's own partition it will probably impact functionality if I overwrite MBR.
2007-12-03T02:28:00.000Z	digitori	PeterT	try mbr to floppy then
2007-12-03T02:29:00.000Z	digitori	PeterT	sorry grub to floppy
2007-12-03T02:32:00.000Z	PeterT	digitori	ok, I could put grub on an SD card or something for test purposes, but I'd rather not rely on any kind of floppy in the long run.  On the other hand, one possibility may be to get rid of mediadirect altogether and have the special button on my laptop automatically boot ubuntu...
2007-12-03T02:32:00.000Z	PeterT	digitori	anyway, I'm off to experiment a bit, thanks.
