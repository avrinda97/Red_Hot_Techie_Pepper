2011-02-08T23:57:00.000Z	netzapper		how does apt handle conflicts? If I add the debian-sid repositories, is ubuntu going to go look there for, like, libc? Or, is there some precedence process and it'll only draw from the lower repos when it can't find something in the upper ones?
2011-02-08T23:57:00.000Z	maco	netzapper	whatever's the highest version number wins
2011-02-08T23:57:00.000Z	maco	netzapper	adding debian repos to yur ubuntu would be a very BAD idea
2011-02-08T23:58:00.000Z	maco	netzapper	because yeah, it could have a newer libc6, and then everything goes boom when that mismatches the kernel...
2011-02-08T23:58:00.000Z	netzapper	maco	damn. I was afraid of that. Is there any way I can get this set of debian packages from the repo (so that it'll handle deps), but mask out everything not directly referred to the particular package I want?
2011-02-08T23:58:00.000Z	maco	netzapper	yes, apt pinning. check man 5 apt_preference
2011-02-08T23:58:00.000Z	maco	netzapper	yes, apt pinning. check man 5 apt_preferences
2011-02-08T23:59:00.000Z	netzapper	maco	sweet. Thankee!
2011-02-08T23:59:00.000Z	maco	netzapper	ideal would be grabbing the *source* packages from debian and building them locally for your ubuntu
2011-02-08T23:59:00.000Z	maco	netzapper	since thats exactly how ubuntu packages come about :)
2011-02-08T23:59:00.000Z	netzapper	maco	hmm... the issue is that it's got about 35 dependencies, and I don't want to manually track them all down. I have no problem building from source, I just want the deps resolved automatically.
2011-02-09T00:00:00.000Z	maco	netzapper	if you build a source package into a binary package, the dependency tracking stuff stays since its still a package
2011-02-09T00:00:00.000Z	maco	netzapper	it just means grabbing the source package (apt-get source foo) and then "debuild -uc-us" to make it spit out a deb
2011-02-09T00:01:00.000Z	netzapper	maco	right, except I want it to track down all the source packages of the dependencies too. Basically, I'm trying to get a whole software stack for which the Ubuntu distro is nearly a year out of date... it's, like, 35 packages, all of which I need... plus stuff like libxml2 and libc, which, obviously, I don't want pulled in.
2011-02-09T00:01:00.000Z	maco	netzapper	but eh yeah this is probably getting more complicated than pinning...
2011-02-09T00:02:00.000Z	maco	netzapper	i guess what id do is add the repo, apt-get update && apt-get install the package, then remove the repo again
2011-02-09T00:03:00.000Z	netzapper	maco	yeah, that was my first instinct. Thought maybe there'd be a better way.
2011-02-09T00:03:00.000Z	maco	netzapper	since apt-get install will act as a this-package-only upgrade if its already installed, and then by removing it you avoid other things getting wrongly updated
2011-02-09T00:03:00.000Z	netzapper	maco	oh, I see. So, install the ubuntu version, add repo, apt-get install the particular packages I want, remove the repo.
2011-02-09T00:04:00.000Z	maco	netzapper	eh i guess it doesnt really matter whether you have the ubuntu one already installed actually
2011-02-09T00:04:00.000Z	maco	netzapper	but just *cross fingers* that the debian version isnt gonna want a new version of some critical lib
2011-02-09T00:05:00.000Z	netzapper	maco	yeah... about that. It being the production cluster environment and all... ::grin::
