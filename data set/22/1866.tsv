2009-12-17T21:29:00.000Z	Rich864		i had windows installed
2009-12-17T21:30:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Rich864	I just repartitioned to install windows. Can I help you?
2009-12-17T21:31:00.000Z	Rich864	JonathanEllis	Yes please, i tried to install windows 7, and it told me than it couldnt be installed on a partition that wasnt formatted to NTFS
2009-12-17T21:32:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Rich864	Yes. Windows needs to be installed on a FAT, FAT32 or NTFS partition. It also has to be a primary partition.
2009-12-17T21:33:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Rich864	There are a few choices you can make while repartitioning to make your windows installation a bit more robust which I can take you through if you like
2009-12-17T21:37:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Rich864	Do you still need help on partitioning for windows? I have spent the last few days doing that and sorting it to have separate partitions for Documents and Settings and other key directories
2009-12-17T21:40:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Rich864	The advantage of separate partitions is that then changes in Docs & Settings cant fragment operating system and program files. In My experience, fragmentation on an NTFS volume is what slows down the pc the most
2009-12-17T21:42:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Rich864	I have created separate partitions for windows, documents and settings, my documents, my music and swap space. So my windows installation is more like a linux installation. The swap file changes size all the time so if that is on the same partition as everything else it can cause fragmentation.
2009-12-17T21:42:00.000Z	Rich864	JonathanEllis	Thanks, i understand that, but it's my brothers PC that i'm trying to install Windows 7 on, and as i said, he barely ever uses it, so a little slowing down won't really affect him
2009-12-17T21:44:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Rich864	It also makes sense to keep your data separate from your programs to simplify backup and recovery. You will have to create a partition for windows anyway so why not start in a good way, then the pc should hopefully stay fast. This discussion could get quite involved. Would other people prefer it if we talked privately? Rich would that be better for you too?
2009-12-17T21:45:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Rich864	I take it you wont be using the windows yourself then?
2009-12-17T21:47:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Rich864	What OS are you using now?
2009-12-17T21:49:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Rich864	Can you refresh my memory on what the partitioning problem is and what you want to achieve?
2009-12-17T21:51:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Rich864	Can you take a screenshot of gparted and put it up on imagebin so I can see what your partitions look like?
2009-12-17T22:40:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Rich864	Did you manage to make a partition for windows successfully or do you still need help?
