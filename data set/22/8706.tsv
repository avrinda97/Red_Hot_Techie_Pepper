2005-09-21T12:29:00.000Z	pluffsy		hello
2005-09-21T12:31:00.000Z	pluffsy		I'm trying to follow the RestrictedFormats howto but I'm failing. I added the repository in the howto but synaptic says: W: Couldn't stat source package list http://ubuntu-backports.mirrormax.net hoary-extras/main Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/ubuntu-backports.mirrormax.net_dists_hoary-extras_main_binary-powerpc_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)
2005-09-21T12:31:00.000Z	pluffsy		any ideas what's wrong?
2005-09-21T12:31:00.000Z	nalioth	pluffsy	you using breezy?
2005-09-21T12:32:00.000Z	pluffsy	nalioth	no hoary
2005-09-21T12:32:00.000Z	nalioth	pluffsy	perhaps the server is down atm
2005-09-21T12:35:00.000Z	pluffsy	nalioth	ahh it's not always me doing something wrong. now it seems to work with no changes, guess they just restarted or something. thanks.
2005-09-21T12:35:00.000Z	nalioth	pluffsy	yes, usually it's network diffeculties
2005-11-20T13:44:00.000Z	nalioth	pluffsy	ubotu is gonna send you some instructions, ok? i want you to run them and choose the VESA driver
2005-11-20T13:45:00.000Z	pluffsy	nalioth	thanks. should I end my current xsession before I run that? or can I just open a gui terminal?
2005-11-20T13:45:00.000Z	nalioth	pluffsy	either way
2005-11-20T14:16:00.000Z	pluffsy	nalioth	I tried running that xcfg but I still just get a black screen and a mouse when I try to login to gnome from gdm. kde stills works.
2005-11-20T14:16:00.000Z	nalioth	pluffsy	did you choose the VESA driver?
2005-11-20T14:18:00.000Z	pluffsy	nalioth	err. hehe did you say that? totally missed that in that case. I selected defaults. where should I select VESA? is that a graphics card driver? (btw I'm on a powerbook ppc if that makes a difference)
2005-11-20T14:18:00.000Z	nalioth	pluffsy	as a display driver, choose VESA
2005-11-20T14:18:00.000Z	nalioth	pluffsy	good, i love macs
2005-11-20T14:18:00.000Z	pluffsy	nalioth	alright. I'll try again. thanks :)
2005-11-20T14:22:00.000Z	pluffsy	nalioth	now it asks me about modules I want xserver to load. is that the place? it says something about VESA BIOS (but my computer doesn't have a bios of course)
2005-11-20T14:22:00.000Z	nalioth	pluffsy	display driver VESA, no modules, just display driver
2005-11-20T14:24:00.000Z	pluffsy	nalioth	hmm I feel stupid but it never asked about a display driver. maybe I shouldn't have selected autoconfigure graphics card or whatever the first option was?
2005-11-20T14:24:00.000Z	nalioth	pluffsy	yes, that would be good
2005-11-20T14:25:00.000Z	pluffsy	nalioth	"attempt to autodetect video hardware?" and I should select No?
