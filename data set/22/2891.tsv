2009-02-14T08:50:00.000Z	GeffIsLegend		hey everyone , i need to figure out how to get my world of warcraft sounds working :-/
2009-02-14T08:51:00.000Z	GeffIsLegend		whats appdb?
2009-02-14T08:52:00.000Z	rdw200169	GeffIsLegend	have you checked to make sure sound works in wineconfig first?
2009-02-14T08:53:00.000Z	GeffIsLegend		im pretty sure, i have all the audio settings enabled
2009-02-14T08:53:00.000Z	rdw200169	GeffIsLegend	it's: winecfg on the cmd line
2009-02-14T08:53:00.000Z	rdw200169	GeffIsLegend	you have to make sure the sound test works there *first*
2009-02-14T08:54:00.000Z	rdw200169	GeffIsLegend	b/c if wine can't output sound, WoW never will ;)
2009-02-14T08:54:00.000Z	GeffIsLegend	rdw200169	 yeah i just tested sound it worked, should i enable sound emulation?
2009-02-14T08:55:00.000Z	rdw200169	GeffIsLegend	no, i just have Full/44100/16 for the option
2009-02-14T08:55:00.000Z	rdw200169	GeffIsLegend	are you using the alsa driver?
2009-02-14T08:56:00.000Z	GeffIsLegend	rdw200169	 thats what i got , and i got everything in the check boxes checked in also
2009-02-14T08:56:00.000Z	GeffIsLegend	rdw200169	pretty sure all of them are enabled, is this bad? lol
2009-02-14T08:56:00.000Z	rdw200169	GeffIsLegend	just use alsa
2009-02-14T08:57:00.000Z	rdw200169	GeffIsLegend	wine is a bastard about alsa, it will only use the 'default'
2009-02-14T08:58:00.000Z	GeffIsLegend		oo , hah, should i reset WoW and try it?
2009-02-14T08:58:00.000Z	rdw200169	GeffIsLegend	sure, wouldn't hurt
2009-02-14T08:58:00.000Z	GeffIsLegend	rdw200169	kk1min
2009-02-14T09:00:00.000Z	GeffIsLegend	rdw200169	didnt work :-/
2009-02-14T09:04:00.000Z	rdw200169	GeffIsLegend	i don't know then... have you check the config.wtf file to make sure it's alright (for WoW)?
2009-02-14T09:04:00.000Z	GeffIsLegend		ill have to double check, where does the Config.WTF go exactly? which directory
2009-02-14T09:06:00.000Z	GeffIsLegend	rdw200169	ill have to double check, where does the Config.WTF go exactly? which directory
2009-02-14T09:06:00.000Z	rdw200169	GeffIsLegend	it should be in the WTF directory of where WoW is installed
