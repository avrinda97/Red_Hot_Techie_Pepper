2010-09-19T10:57:00.000Z	elricsfate		hi all
2010-09-19T10:58:00.000Z	elricsfate		Anyone up for doing a little bit of reading?
2010-09-19T11:00:00.000Z	icarus-c	elricsfate	it seems to me all your arguments doesn't tell why Linux is better than other open source Unix-like OS
2010-09-19T11:01:00.000Z	elricsfate	icarus-c	good point.
2010-09-19T11:02:00.000Z	elricsfate	icarus-c	This was mainly wrote to educate people who don't even know Unix or Linux exist. It may be a good idea to integrate what makes Linux better over something such as BSD or Solaris. You make a good point and I agree.
2010-09-19T11:02:00.000Z	icarus-c	elricsfate	and you should make a clear contrast between Linux & Windows by also describing the Windows side
2010-09-19T11:03:00.000Z	elricsfate	icarus-c	Roger. In which doc. The letter or the essay?
2010-09-19T11:03:00.000Z	icarus-c	elricsfate	the essay. i haven't read letter yet :P
2010-09-19T11:04:00.000Z	icarus-c	elricsfate	i haven't finish reading the letter, but after reading a few sentences it seems that you assuming Free & Open Source Software in business come with NO cost?
2010-09-19T11:05:00.000Z	elricsfate	icarus-c	Roger. I believe the other guy was talking about my letter which is block.
2010-09-19T11:05:00.000Z	elricsfate	icarus-c	No it has cost but it would have LESS cost than our current setup I believe
2010-09-19T11:05:00.000Z	icarus-c	elricsfate	 and there is liability for FOSS in business
2010-09-19T11:06:00.000Z	elricsfate	icarus-c	IMO I looked at not just my school but the whole system and saw a lot of waste.
2010-09-19T11:06:00.000Z	icarus-c	elricsfate	like.. who to blame if you Linux/FOSS system fail?
2010-09-19T11:06:00.000Z	icarus-c	elricsfate	with proprietary software, if the system fail the boss could only take it, but not fireing people
2010-09-19T11:06:00.000Z	elricsfate	icarus-c	Who to blame if a Windows based system fails? Microsoft? No the IT. It would be the IT either way
2010-09-19T11:07:00.000Z	icarus-c	elricsfate	after all, your arguments should be backed up by data & references to make it convincing
2010-09-19T11:08:00.000Z	icarus-c	elricsfate	especially the letter,  business man needs numbers :)
2010-09-19T11:09:00.000Z	elricsfate	icarus-c	that was to a principal. Although I agree numbers should have been included in hindsight lol.
2010-09-19T11:11:00.000Z	elricsfate	icarus-c	I agree on the essay though. I can back that up with some more data. I actually like the essay enough I may expand on it and use it later. It was actually just a 1 pager for english comp. I am thinking about burning some copies of Ubuntu to distribute in class along with the essays .
2010-09-19T11:15:00.000Z	icarus-c	elricsfate	Arafangi1n: offtopic guys
2010-09-19T11:15:00.000Z	elricsfate	icarus-c	see ya there
