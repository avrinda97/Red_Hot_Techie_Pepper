2012-05-16T07:12:00.000Z	mongo	Guest72970	you will need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list and remove the lines with "ppa" in them
2012-05-16T07:14:00.000Z	mongo	Guest72970	some time before you installed a 3rd party version of flash, it is probably blocking the install but I have been at work for 14 hours I have to bail.
