2008-07-02T12:05:00.000Z	yesudeep		I can't seem to be able to copy files to my Sony Ericsson cell phone using Bluetooth with Hardy.  What could be the problem?
2008-07-02T12:06:00.000Z	magnetron	yesudeep	you may need the gnome-bluetooth package
2008-07-02T12:06:00.000Z	yesudeep	magnetron	Alright.  I'll try that.
2008-07-02T12:07:00.000Z	magnetron	yesudeep	there's another package you might need too.. something named vfs obex something. let me get the name
2008-07-02T12:08:00.000Z	magnetron	yesudeep	the package's name is gnome-vfs-obexftp . don't forget to pair with the phone first
2008-07-02T12:09:00.000Z	yesudeep	magnetron	I was able to pair with the phone, and copy files off of it, but not send files to it.
2008-07-02T12:10:00.000Z	yesudeep	magnetron	I get "Operation not supported by backend"
2008-07-02T12:11:00.000Z	magnetron	yesudeep	setting your computer to "trusted" in your phone may help
2008-07-02T12:12:00.000Z	yesudeep	magnetron	Nope.  Doesn't work.
2008-07-02T12:13:00.000Z	magnetron	yesudeep	maybe your ericsson doesn't support OBEX push?
2008-07-02T12:14:00.000Z	yesudeep	magnetron	You mean the ability to store files on the phone?
2008-07-02T12:14:00.000Z	yesudeep	magnetron	I've done that using Windows in the past.
2008-07-02T12:15:00.000Z	magnetron	yesudeep	no, not the ability to store files
2008-07-02T12:18:00.000Z	yesudeep	magnetron	It supports "object push"
2008-07-02T12:18:00.000Z	yesudeep	magnetron	"object push, file transfer, audio remote controller, and audio remote control target"
2008-07-02T12:18:00.000Z	magnetron	yesudeep	i see.
2008-07-02T12:21:00.000Z	yesudeep	magnetron	What can I do?  Can aI send files using the terminal?
2008-07-02T12:22:00.000Z	magnetron	yesudeep	you should keep investigating your problem
2008-07-02T12:22:00.000Z	yesudeep	magnetron	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=747800 says feature not implemented
