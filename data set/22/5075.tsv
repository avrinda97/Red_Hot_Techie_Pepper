2009-05-29T04:55:00.000Z	hvgotcodes		how do i add something to my path permanently?
2009-05-29T04:56:00.000Z	bjorn	hvgotcodes	the path is usually setup in .bashrc in your home directory
2009-05-29T04:56:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	bjorn	i looked in there didn't see it
2009-05-29T04:57:00.000Z	bjorn	hvgotcodes	yes that is correct
2009-05-29T04:58:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	bjorn	thanx
2009-05-29T04:58:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	bjorn	i installed java from synaptic but the JAVA_HOME var is not set
2009-05-29T04:58:00.000Z	bjorn	hvgotcodes	you can also do 'echo $PATH' to review your current path. it's just an env. variable
2009-05-29T04:59:00.000Z	bjorn	hvgotcodes	i'm not sure, probably it should. However setting that up will be the same (.bashrc is just a shell script executed on login - you can write anything there that goes into the shell)
2009-05-29T05:00:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	bjorn	just not sure where the java home is
2009-05-29T05:01:00.000Z	bjorn	hvgotcodes	I have got no such variable setup in my env. i compiled a java application yesterday. not sure what you're trying to achieve
2009-05-29T05:02:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	bjorn	its wierd - i can run eclipse no problem, but have no env var for JAVA_HOME
2009-05-29T05:06:00.000Z	bjorn	hvgotcodes	try ' /usr/lib/jamvm/'
2009-05-29T05:07:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	bjorn	 /usr/bin/java -> /etc/alternatives/java
2009-05-29T05:08:00.000Z	bjorn	hvgotcodes	yep that is true for my setup, but some googeling gave that the dir. of interest would be found by locate /rt.jar
2009-05-29T05:08:00.000Z	bjorn	hvgotcodes	i mean the regular java executable should just be in path, and not needed to be specified in another directory? Frankly i'm quite off now
2009-05-29T05:09:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	bjorn	i dont have the dir you reference, but I do have /usr/lib/jvm/
2009-05-29T05:09:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	bjorn	grails needs an env_var
2009-05-29T05:11:00.000Z	bjorn	hvgotcodes	try to set it to your /usr/lib/* directory and see what happens...sorry i'm not famililar with this
2009-05-29T05:12:00.000Z	bjorn	hvgotcodes	did it work?
2009-05-29T05:13:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	bjorn	that worked like a champ.  sorry for the flood
2009-05-29T05:14:00.000Z	bjorn	hvgotcodes	great work
2009-05-29T05:15:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	bjorn	now i need to think of an app to train myself on grails with
