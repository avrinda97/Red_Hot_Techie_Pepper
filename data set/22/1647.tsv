2010-03-13T20:42:00.000Z	DasEi	DarkStar1	what's the prob now ?
2010-03-13T20:42:00.000Z	DarkStar1	DasEi	/etc/group is locked out even though it's not opened
2010-03-13T20:43:00.000Z	DasEi	DarkStar1	locked means ?
2010-03-13T20:44:00.000Z	DarkStar1	DasEi	I can't access it to edit it
2010-03-13T20:44:00.000Z	DasEi	DarkStar1	you need root for systemfiles
2010-03-13T20:44:00.000Z	DasEi	DarkStar1	gksudo gedit /etc/group
2010-03-13T20:44:00.000Z	DarkStar1	DasEi	that's not the problem..
2010-03-13T20:45:00.000Z	DarkStar1	DasEi	I have permiussion already
2010-03-13T20:46:00.000Z	DasEi	DarkStar1	sudo addgroup doesn't work ? still don't get your issue
2010-03-13T20:48:00.000Z	DarkStar1	DasEi	I got an answer form another channel thanks
2010-03-13T20:55:00.000Z	DasEi	DarkStar1	can call nautilus as root
2010-03-13T20:56:00.000Z	DarkStar1	DasEi	Yes.. how do I do that?
2010-03-13T20:57:00.000Z	DasEi	DarkStar1	please read the above link to understand root in ubuntu ( and it's possible dangers)
2010-03-13T20:58:00.000Z	DarkStar1	DasEi	I'm aware of it's dangers. It's just quicker to create the folders I need to create using a gui thna typing them out
2010-03-13T20:59:00.000Z	DasEi	DarkStar1	depends on habits, cli is faster then gui I'd say
2010-03-13T21:00:00.000Z	DarkStar1	DasEi	I'm talking about the speed in which I can get the task accomplished not the interface
2010-03-13T21:00:00.000Z	DasEi	DarkStar1	sudo mkdir anydir,  slower then gui ? haha
2010-03-13T21:01:00.000Z	DarkStar1	DasEi	Typing and sequential naming
2010-03-13T21:02:00.000Z	DasEi	DarkStar1	go the way you want, it takes some time to get in trml, but in my experience it's much faster
2011-04-15T00:15:00.000Z	DasEi	DarkStar1	man nmap
2011-04-15T00:16:00.000Z	DasEi	DarkStar1	-P option, either seperate ports by colon, or give range 2000-3000
2011-04-15T00:17:00.000Z	DarkStar1	DasEi	thx
