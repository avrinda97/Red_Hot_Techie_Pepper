2010-05-22T16:30:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	easy, if you start from scratch
2010-05-22T16:30:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	install winxp but in the setup, be sure to partition your drive and leave space for another os, i.e. if you have 200gb disk, create c: to contain 100gb, leaving the other 100 "unpartitioned"
2010-05-22T16:31:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	where exactly does it come up with bsod?
2010-05-22T16:33:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	you do *not* want to wipe your bios
2010-05-22T16:33:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	what you do need to do is to wipe windows from your hard disk
2010-05-22T16:34:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	to do this, you can have another operating system installed on top
2010-05-22T16:34:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	no, we can't do it for you
2010-05-22T16:34:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	but it is easy
2010-05-22T16:34:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	especially if you want to just install one operating system
2010-05-22T16:35:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	wait. you want both xp and linux, right?
2010-05-22T16:36:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	then install windows xp normally as you would but be sure to leave space for ubuntu
2010-05-22T16:36:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	and when I say leave space
2010-05-22T16:37:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	I mean, when winxp setup starts
2010-05-22T16:37:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	it asks where you would like to install
2010-05-22T16:37:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	and it gives you several options, one of them is to 'DELETE partition'
2010-05-22T16:37:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	do that for *every* partition on your disk
2010-05-22T16:38:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	then, proceed normally.
2010-05-22T16:39:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	and when everything is OK with XP, start from the Ubuntu CD
2010-05-22T16:39:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	and when asked where to install, create another partition and put ubuntu there
2010-05-22T16:39:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	actually, you might need two partitions, when you reach that stage, come back here and ask
2010-05-22T16:40:00.000Z	athlion	michael1982	and say that you have installed xp and have left some disk space unpartitioned and available for ubuntu, how to install it?
