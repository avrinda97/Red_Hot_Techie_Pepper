2007-07-28T06:19:00.000Z	stuart87		Where can i find the source repo for 915resolution???
2007-07-28T06:21:00.000Z	stuart87		Can someone please point me to a good sources.list? I really need the source repo for 915resolution???
2007-07-28T06:22:00.000Z	stuart87		*source pkg
2007-07-28T06:23:00.000Z	stuart87		the preinstalled default sources.list had nothing
2007-07-28T06:24:00.000Z	gravemin1	stuart87	have you tried enabling universe and multiverse through synaptic?
2007-07-28T06:25:00.000Z	gravemin1	stuart87	system>administration>synaptic, then settings>repositories
2007-07-28T06:26:00.000Z	stuart87	gravemin1	I have no X :-( Thats why i need 915resolution
2007-07-28T06:27:00.000Z	gravemin1	stuart87	lol, that would be a problem :)
2007-07-28T06:27:00.000Z	gravemin1	stuart87	I could give you mine
2007-07-28T06:27:00.000Z	stuart87	gravemin1	lol, fedex it to me
2007-07-28T06:28:00.000Z	gravemin1	stuart87	I think it's just a few lines, you can write them down
2007-07-28T06:28:00.000Z	gravemin1	stuart87	I'll find out what they are
2007-07-28T06:29:00.000Z	stuart87	gravemin1	I was more looking for a good sources.list starting point. I know theres 100000000 different addresses to include, but does anyone know of one that has the 915resolution source
2007-07-28T06:29:00.000Z	gravemin1	stuart87	universe and multiverse do
2007-07-28T06:29:00.000Z	gravemin1	stuart87	just add these to the top of your sources list and you should get good to go
2007-07-28T06:30:00.000Z	gravemin1	stuart87	you have to add those to the top of your sources list: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-07-28T06:32:00.000Z	gravemin1	stuart87	did you copy those two lines I showed you?
2007-07-28T06:32:00.000Z	gravemin1	stuart87	after that you're good to do
2007-07-28T06:34:00.000Z	gravemin1	stuart87	actually, now that I look at it, it looks like you might just need to uncomment certain lines to enable universe and multiverse
2007-07-28T06:35:00.000Z	gravemin1	stuart87	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list and delete the # from the front of relevant lines
