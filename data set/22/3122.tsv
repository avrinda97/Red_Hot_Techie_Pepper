2009-01-02T01:09:00.000Z	trancefat		Hi, does anybody know how to reset the mouse settings in Ubuntu 8.10... My mouse is not functioning properly while double clicking or click dragging to select something
2009-01-02T01:10:00.000Z	therealnanotube	trancefat	look in system -> preferences -> mouse...
2009-01-02T01:10:00.000Z	trancefat	therealnanotube	i did that
2009-01-02T01:11:00.000Z	therealnanotube	trancefat	what exactly is your mouse doing, can you describe?
2009-01-02T01:11:00.000Z	trancefat	therealnanotube	when i try to drag a window by its title bar, it instantly takes it as a double click action
2009-01-02T01:12:00.000Z	trancefat	therealnanotube	if select some text then it doesnt select entirely, ending the selection halfway
2009-01-02T01:12:00.000Z	therealnanotube	trancefat	and when you click anywhere else - does it also take it instantly as a double-click action? or just the title bar?
2009-01-02T01:12:00.000Z	trancefat	therealnanotube	just when i m trying to click and drag
2009-01-02T01:12:00.000Z	trancefat	therealnanotube	like dragging a window or selecting texct
2009-01-02T01:12:00.000Z	therealnanotube	trancefat	and your right click, is that ok?
2009-01-02T01:12:00.000Z	trancefat	therealnanotube	yes it is
2009-01-02T01:13:00.000Z	trancefat	therealnanotube	is there some setting that can reset the mouse to factory settings
2009-01-02T01:13:00.000Z	therealnanotube	trancefat	could be a bad mouse button... try switching from right to left-handed mouse in the mouse settings, and see if you can start using the right mouse button as your left mouse button, and see if it click and drags ok.
2009-01-02T01:13:00.000Z	trancefat	therealnanotube	coz this is a recent problem... earlier it worked fine
2009-01-02T01:13:00.000Z	trancefat	therealnanotube	ok.. i think you are right
2009-01-02T01:14:00.000Z	trancefat	therealnanotube	maybe the mouse is old
2009-01-02T01:14:00.000Z	therealnanotube	trancefat	try it, if it works, then you know its the button.
2009-01-02T01:14:00.000Z	trancefat	therealnanotube	ok, thanks
2009-01-02T01:14:00.000Z	therealnanotube	trancefat	if it doesn't work... then it's something else :)
2009-01-02T01:15:00.000Z	trancefat	therealnanotube	i made the mouse to left-handed and it works fine!
2009-01-02T01:16:00.000Z	therealnanotube	trancefat	ok, then, so it's a bad button then. (happened to me too, on a couple of mice...)
2009-01-02T01:16:00.000Z	trancefat	therealnanotube	ok... thanks again
