2007-05-19T16:22:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	shooters	wish me luck :)
2007-05-19T16:37:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	shooters	nothing worked. Rundown: Alt-F2 didn't do anything from within the X-server, but Ctrl-Alt-F1 did get me the terminal. "nautilus" returns cannot open display, "metacity" returns Window manager warning: "" found in configuration database is not a valid value for key binding "toggle_shape" Unable to open X display. After Ctrl-Alt-f1, killall compiz returns compiz: no process killed. I further tried Ctrl-Alt-F1, gnome-pane
2007-05-19T16:37:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	shooters	am I f****ed ??
2007-05-19T16:38:00.000Z	shooters	CaptainMorgan	left me check...
2007-05-19T16:40:00.000Z	shooters	CaptainMorgan	CTRL-Alt-F1 "sudo apt-get remove beryl compiz"
2007-05-19T16:42:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	shooters	should I purge on removal too?
2007-05-19T16:56:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	shooters	I did Ctrl-Alt-F1 and sudo apt-get remove beryl compiz which didn't totally remove compiz, so I rebooted to see if it had any effect. Then I did Ctrl-Alt-F1 sudo apt-get remove compiz-core which removed the last of the compiz(compiz-gtk, compiz-gnome etc..) rebooted and this still did not work. I am in linux now however by virtue of the Failsafe Terminal session and everything is back to normal in this session.. how
2007-05-19T16:57:00.000Z	shooters	CaptainMorgan	try doing a Ctrl-Alt-Backspace and tell me what happens
2007-05-19T16:57:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	shooters	it logged me out where I decided to go into the Failsafe
2007-05-19T16:59:00.000Z	shooters	CaptainMorgan	try removing ~/.dmrc
2007-05-19T05:00:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	shooters	Failsafe will simply "not load scripts", and I could use "Last Session" to login from now... is this bad? I am not knowledgeable about Failsafe...
2007-05-19T05:02:00.000Z	shooters	CaptainMorgan	try Last Session
2007-05-19T05:02:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	shooters	k, I have removed .dmrc.. gonna log out now and try again
2007-05-19T05:08:00.000Z	shooters	CaptainMorgan	worked?
2007-05-19T05:08:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	shooters	when I said failsafe terminal, I meant failsafe gnome.... Failsafe Gnome is the only session that works. The regular Gnome session is Fubar'd and the Last Session option does not work - it opens the fubar'd Gnome session
2007-05-19T05:09:00.000Z	shooters	CaptainMorgan	when you say fubar'd, you mean you get a visual, but no panels, right?
2007-05-19T05:09:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	shooters	 it appears .dmrc has been overwritten too, this time with session=gnome instead of default
2007-05-19T05:10:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	shooters	right - no panels in the Gnome session
2007-05-19T05:11:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	shooters	from where? within Failsafe?
2007-05-19T05:12:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	shooters	 I am looking at Apps/System/Prefs/ and I see no Desktop Effects, as it should be... but why am I having trouble with regular Gnome?
2007-05-19T05:13:00.000Z	shooters	CaptainMorgan	can you check your logs to see if there is any hints there, 'cause I'm starting to get out of ideas...
2007-05-19T05:18:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	shooters	the only that resembles what you state is /var/log/Xorg.o.log which is a huge file and I can't make sense of it... looks like a mix of the original xorg.conf with the binary representation of xorg.conf
