2010-05-22T10:00:00.000Z	aiden		its all at 100%
2010-05-22T10:01:00.000Z	aiden		my friend said its something to do with the nvidia hda card and ubuntu dont like eachother.. he told me to come here for help
2010-05-22T10:01:00.000Z	aiden		i can give you remote access if you think you can maybe figure it out =x which is sketchy but at this point... idc
2010-05-22T10:01:00.000Z	aiden		theres a restricted driver for nvidia
2010-05-22T10:01:00.000Z	aiden		but if i enable it
2010-05-22T10:02:00.000Z	aiden		when my computer reboots it plays the startup sounds but never shows anything on the screen
2010-05-22T10:02:00.000Z	PDG1	aiden	as in display stops working?
2010-05-22T09:58:00.000Z	PDG1	aiden	what kind of non system sounds? like music?
2010-05-22T10:00:00.000Z	PDG1	aiden	funky...
2010-05-22T10:00:00.000Z	PDG1	aiden	have you gone into the mixer to see if something is muted?
2010-05-22T10:01:00.000Z	PDG1	aiden	do you know if there's a restricted driver for it?
2010-05-22T10:03:00.000Z	PDG1	aiden	well I apologize... I'm not very good with these kinds of issues. I figured it was better than no one answering tho :P
2010-05-22T10:04:00.000Z	PDG1	aiden	is it an NVidia card that the sound is being processed with?
2010-05-22T10:05:00.000Z	PDG1	aiden	maybe there's something on the forums to do with that card
2010-05-22T10:07:00.000Z	PDG1	aiden	so I take it you already know the exact make of your MOBO and card and everything
2010-05-22T10:09:00.000Z	PDG1	aiden	I know you can find more information by getting into terminal and typing "sudo lshw"
2010-05-22T10:10:00.000Z	PDG1	aiden	I'm not sure what else to say except to maybe try some speacialty forums for linux in general if no one else here is helping right away
2010-05-22T10:10:00.000Z	PDG1	aiden	or Debian
