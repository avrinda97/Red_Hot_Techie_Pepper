2008-11-04T10:24:00.000Z	toastedmilk	soreau	I did a little work with C++ in HS a few years ago, so I think I can pick up the backbone of a programming language
2008-11-04T10:24:00.000Z	toastedmilk	soreau	any good websites for a tutorial?
2008-11-04T10:25:00.000Z	soreau	toastedmilk	That just reminds me.. I forgot to bookmark all my good links before nuking that partition..

2010-02-09T01:28:00.000Z	toastedmilk	soreau	so is the community going to just leave the hd cards to fglrx, or implement them in the radeon driver?
2010-02-09T01:29:00.000Z	toastedmilk	soreau	lol, radeon is usually dead
2010-02-09T01:29:00.000Z	soreau	toastedmilk	You have it all backward. radeonhd is dying, radeon is very lively

2010-02-09T01:30:00.000Z	toastedmilk	soreau	so is the community going to just leave the hd cards to fglrx, or implement them in the radeon driver?
2010-02-09T01:30:00.000Z	soreau	toastedmilk	You are very confused
2010-02-09T01:31:00.000Z	toastedmilk	soreau	no, im just fairly uneducated
2010-02-09T01:31:00.000Z	toastedmilk	soreau	you said the radeonhd driver was dying, correct?
2010-02-09T01:33:00.000Z	soreau	toastedmilk	Yes, get more info in #radeon. The channel is not dead at all, if you idle there for any length of time. Also, it is officially logged, so you can read how much traffic is there each day
