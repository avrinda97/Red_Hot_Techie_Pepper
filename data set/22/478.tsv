2011-09-05T04:34:00.000Z	xsrv		is there a way to see wifi connection status via terminal?
2011-09-05T04:35:00.000Z	Stanley00	xsrv	ifconfig and iwconfig will  do
2011-09-05T04:35:00.000Z	Stanley00	xsrv	thay dont need sudo to just print the status
2011-09-05T04:39:00.000Z	xsrv	Stanley00	a complete listing of available wifi networks would be better
2011-09-05T04:39:00.000Z	Stanley00	xsrv	then try ifconfig -a ;)
2011-09-05T04:40:00.000Z	xsrv	Stanley00	are you sure that will list available WIFI networks?
2011-09-05T04:40:00.000Z	xsrv	Stanley00	anyway, thanks, I'll try
2011-09-05T04:42:00.000Z	xsrv	Stanley00	just tried ifconfig -a, it doesn't list wifi networks
2011-09-05T04:42:00.000Z	Stanley00	xsrv	sorry, I misunderstood.
2011-09-05T04:44:00.000Z	Stanley00	xsrv	you can try iwlist  wlan0 scanning, I hopt
2011-09-05T04:44:00.000Z	Stanley00	xsrv	hope*
2011-09-05T04:45:00.000Z	xsrv	Stanley00	will try
2011-09-05T04:46:00.000Z	xsrv	Stanley00	works without sudo, but then it doesn't list all the available wifi networks, only the one I'm connected to
2011-09-05T04:47:00.000Z	Stanley00	xsrv	hmm...
2011-09-05T04:48:00.000Z	xsrv	Stanley00	actually, I have to write a program that gets info about networks
2011-09-05T04:48:00.000Z	Stanley00	xsrv	hmm, I think there will be a tool somewhere in iw* command,
2011-09-05T04:49:00.000Z	Stanley00	xsrv	I trying to find out now.
2011-09-05T04:49:00.000Z	xsrv	Stanley00	alright
2011-09-05T04:50:00.000Z	xsrv	Stanley00	I'm pretty sure my program could run as root, but then it would be dangerous
2011-09-05T04:53:00.000Z	Stanley00	xsrv	hmm, cant find out...
2011-09-05T04:54:00.000Z	xsrv	Stanley00	hmmâ€¦ well, thanks anyway
2011-09-05T04:55:00.000Z	Stanley00	xsrv	I cant help you, sorry. :(
