2008-11-17T17:16:00.000Z	jobe		can someone help me config xorg.conf in ibex? It comes empty, and I whenever I add lines (as described in ibex wiki) boot hangs :(
2008-11-17T17:16:00.000Z	amias	jobe	you probably dont need any options in xorg.conf unless you;ve got really odd hardware
2008-11-17T17:17:00.000Z	jobe	amias	I do, basically: I need to add sections for my wacom tablet. Its easy to do when the sections are already there (like serverlayout) but if I add any of this stuff manually it doesnt work.
2008-11-17T17:19:00.000Z	amias	jobe	it should be auto detected IIRC , have you looked for supporting packages to configure it ?
2008-11-17T17:21:00.000Z	jobe	amias	yes, I've installed the packages, and it is detected and works, but only minimally. As it says in the wacom wiki, if you want anything more than the most basic functionality you have to edit xorg.conf in the old fashioned way. but unfortunatly none of the sections are there to edit any more, so you have to add them yourself, but if I do that then everything goes kaput :( is there a guide to adding missing sections in xorg.conf when its empty as in ibex?
2008-11-17T17:22:00.000Z	amias	jobe	bummer , somebody must have done this on the forums somewhere
2008-11-17T17:23:00.000Z	jobe	amias	yes, I've been looking, but most posts I've found just say 'if the sections arent already there then add them' but if I do this then I get problems, and I dont know why
2008-11-17T17:24:00.000Z	amias	jobe	well your config must be wrong , have you looked at /var/log/Xorg.0.log or similar ?
2008-11-17T17:25:00.000Z	jobe	amias	hmm, no, will it have entries for previous boots? because I wont be able to read it until I replace xorg.conf with the backup version and reboot
2008-11-17T17:26:00.000Z	amias	jobe	it will always be the last boot , have a look for other Xorg.*.log files
2008-11-17T17:28:00.000Z	jobe	amias	so I have to read the log file in cli? because -> change xorg.conf -> reboot -> hangs -> reboot in failsafe -> replace xorg.conf with backup -> reboot -> logfiles no longer refer to the hanging boot :(
2008-11-17T17:29:00.000Z	amias	jobe	when you say hangs do you mean the computer locks solid or X doesn't start and it asks if you want to read the logs ?
2008-11-17T17:30:00.000Z	jobe	amias	well I think the comp hasnt frozen, but monitor says out of range or frequency or something, so there is no video output at all, so my only option is to reboot (I tried gettin cli from that situation 'blind' by ctrl + alt + F2 type thing, but nothing responds to my keyboard input)
2008-11-17T17:31:00.000Z	jobe	amias	most likely that its just video output that is stopped, not actual processes - i think alt + sysrq +b works, so kernel is still running
2008-11-17T17:31:00.000Z	amias	jobe	hold ctrl+alt+F2 for a bit longer ,
2008-11-17T17:32:00.000Z	jobe	amias	ok. what would I use to view the files from cli? echo? nano? or should I boot up livecd and access the logs that way so no other reboot takes place?
2008-11-17T17:34:00.000Z	amias	jobe	a livece might help but first i would try removing any graphics setup options from you xorg.cofn
2008-11-17T17:36:00.000Z	jobe	amias	like remove "Screen        "Default Screen"" from server layout and its corresponding section further down? because there is a section for nvidia but its not listed in serverlayout - maybe it should be in there? but by default the nvidia entry is there, but there is no serverlayout section at all, so maybe thats causing problems, that ve added a new serverlayout section but not added the nvidia device which is listed....?
2008-11-17T17:37:00.000Z	amias	jobe	remove the nvidia bits
2008-11-17T17:38:00.000Z	jobe	amias	but wont that mess up my video config? that works nicely at the moment I dont want to cause myself lots more problems
2008-11-17T17:40:00.000Z	amias	jobe	read this , first google result for 'xorg.conf intrepid wacom' , try hotplugging it instead - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wacom-tools/+bug/260675
2008-11-17T17:55:00.000Z	jobe	amias	heh, im still reading that thread you posted and the one it flows into, about 3/4 done :)
