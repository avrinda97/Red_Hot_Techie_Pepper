2007-12-06T18:39:00.000Z	damaltor	BrianB04	think i can help u
2007-12-06T18:40:00.000Z	damaltor	BrianB04	but wait a sec
2007-12-06T18:40:00.000Z	BrianB04	damaltor	Sure thing, got time:)
2007-12-06T18:41:00.000Z	damaltor	BrianB04	could you paste the file /etx/X11/xorg.conf to nopaste.com?
2007-12-06T18:42:00.000Z	BrianB04	damaltor	Unfortunetly I'm at work, so I don't have a copy with me.
2007-12-06T18:42:00.000Z	damaltor		ah oh well
2007-12-06T18:42:00.000Z	damaltor	BrianB04	you will have to edit the file
2007-12-06T18:42:00.000Z	BrianB04		WHich I have done before. But I didn't see anything unusual
2007-12-06T18:43:00.000Z	damaltor	BrianB04	you have to set color depth to 24 and you have to add the line >>Option "UseDisplayDevice" "DFP<< in the device section
2007-12-06T18:44:00.000Z	BrianB04	damaltor	What does DFP stand for?
2007-12-06T18:44:00.000Z	damaltor	BrianB04	lost a " in the end of the line by asting
2007-12-06T18:44:00.000Z	BrianB04		I figured.
2007-12-06T18:44:00.000Z	damaltor	BrianB04	if im honest i have no idea, but worked well on three pcs now
2007-12-06T18:45:00.000Z	damaltor	BrianB04	the "other" option of the line was CRT so i think it has something to do with screens
2007-12-06T18:46:00.000Z	BrianB04	damaltor	And that actually goes under the video card device section?
2007-12-06T18:47:00.000Z	damaltor	BrianB04	wait ill have a look
2007-12-06T18:47:00.000Z	BrianB04		You know though, that would make sense that it's just not sending it to the right type of monitor. Looks like it's used for twinview
2007-12-06T18:48:00.000Z	damaltor	BrianB04	sorry no, must be directly under DefaultDepth    24
2007-12-06T18:50:00.000Z	BrianB04	damaltor	Well, thanks for the help, I will give that a run tonight.
2007-12-06T18:50:00.000Z	damaltor	BrianB04	ok, do so.. maybe im online then again
2007-12-06T18:51:00.000Z	BrianB04	damaltor	I have an ATI that works by default with restricted, but I get so much funky graphic artifacting it's not worth it.
2007-12-06T18:51:00.000Z	damaltor	BrianB04	thats not nice =)
