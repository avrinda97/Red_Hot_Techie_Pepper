2009-12-06T01:29:00.000Z	boris-migs		can someone here help me?
2009-12-06T01:30:00.000Z	boris-migs		Why can i not save images into my "wallpaper" directory?
2009-12-06T01:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 what wallpaper directory? If you mean the 'system' directory /usr/share/whatever   its because its a system dir. and not writeable by users
2009-12-06T01:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 stick to 'tech support'  please.
2009-12-06T01:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 thats how security works.
2009-12-06T01:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 users shouldent be messing with system directories. Keep your wallpapers in your own home directory.
2009-12-06T01:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 try just saveing it to /home/boris-migs firsst.
2009-12-06T01:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 if that works.. check permissions on the other dierctories.
2009-12-06T01:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 that path seems a little extreme.
2009-12-06T01:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 you can set it up as wallpaper. no matter where its saved to.
2009-12-06T01:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 double click on the image and the default image viewer tool has an option in itss menus.. Or use the 'add' button in the change wallpaper tool.
2009-12-06T01:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 or jusst try drag/dropping it to the wallpaper toolwindoes
2009-12-06T01:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 you some how made some directories that got the wrong permissions/ownership.   where did you get the path /home/boris-migs/imatges/wallpapers/shared/backgrounds from?
2009-12-06T01:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 then  its very likely you are doing somthing very basic wrong. I suggest exploring linux a bit more and learning how the filesystem is laid out.
2009-12-06T01:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 that path you give makes no sence.
2009-12-06T01:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 I keep all my user wallpapers in /home/USERNAME/wallpapers
2009-12-06T01:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	  Theres no real reason to keep them in that place.  Make a wallpapers directory, and copy them to it.
2009-12-06T01:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 i suggest using the normal ubuntu also, and not using crunchbang
2009-12-06T01:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 just make a directory in your home dir called 'wallpapers' and keep the stuff there.  But i dont use crunchbang it could be they got some special stuff setup.
2009-12-06T01:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 well for starters Ubuntu is supported in this channel.. Crunchbang is NOT - you should go to the crunchbang channel
2009-12-06T01:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	 and ubuntu is a 'full featured desktop' crunchbang is more minimal and expects the user to know a bit more linux
2009-12-06T01:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	boris-migs	  /join #whatever  :)
