2012-05-22T02:32:00.000Z	k014		ok, i tried "sudo update-grub2" and detected the windows partition....., then i selected that entry in grub, and begin to boot windows, but windows boots the system recovery partition, ..... not finding any issue, again and again
2012-05-22T02:33:00.000Z	k014		windows7
2012-05-22T02:34:00.000Z	L3top	k014	something is wrong... I would use windows to fixmbr  then  fixboot then update-grub again once windows boots
2012-05-22T02:36:00.000Z	L3top	k014	in order for windows to function, it needs to think it is boss... then you can actually control it with windows.
2012-05-22T02:36:00.000Z	L3top	k014	control it with linux*
2012-05-22T02:37:00.000Z	k014	L3top	how?
2012-05-22T02:38:00.000Z	L3top	k014	as I explained... boot to windows recovery console (from disk) and run the commands fixmbr     and then     fixboot, then reboot and update-grub
2012-05-22T02:39:00.000Z	k014	L3top	thank you...! i gonna try that
2012-05-22T02:42:00.000Z	k014	L3top	'fixmbr' isn not recognized as an internal or external command
2012-05-22T02:42:00.000Z	L3top	k014	it is a windows recovery console command
2012-05-22T02:42:00.000Z	L3top	k014	you will need to boot to a windows disk
2012-05-22T02:43:00.000Z	k014	L3top	maybe the command is: "bootrec /fixmbr" ???
2012-05-22T02:52:00.000Z	k014	L3top	this commands needs to be in windows USB instalation stick?, or from windows recovery partition? (sdb1)
2012-05-22T02:52:00.000Z	L3top	k014	from a windows DVD is all I knwo
