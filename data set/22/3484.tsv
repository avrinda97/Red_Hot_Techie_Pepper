2008-11-25T14:04:00.000Z	zetheroo	ActionParsnip1	would you have any insight into the Atheros chipset in Intrepid?
2008-11-25T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zetheroo	mine works out of the box
2008-11-25T14:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zetheroo	used linux restricted modules
2008-11-25T14:05:00.000Z	zetheroo	ActionParsnip1	mine too ... but not very well ...
2008-11-25T14:06:00.000Z	zetheroo	ActionParsnip1	what is the default driver that Ubuntu uses for the Atheros wifi chip?
2008-11-25T14:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zetheroo	http://paste.ubuntu.com/76727/
2008-11-25T14:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zetheroo	thats what it says from lshw -C network
2008-11-25T14:11:00.000Z	zetheroo	ActionParsnip1	this is what mine says   http://pastebin.com/d69b79058
2008-11-25T14:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zetheroo	looks fine
2008-11-25T14:12:00.000Z	zetheroo	ActionParsnip1	yeah ... just that my wifi never connects automatically ... and I have to refresh the network list manually for it to see anything at all
2008-11-25T14:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zetheroo	do you use any other wifi except this one/
2008-11-25T14:13:00.000Z	zetheroo	ActionParsnip1	none
2008-11-25T14:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zetheroo	you could always manually configure /etc/network/interfaces to be configured for the only wifi it connects to. The app will the be redundant and it will connect without scanning
2008-11-25T14:14:00.000Z	zetheroo	ActionParsnip1	should I try compiling madwifi?
2008-11-25T14:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zetheroo	no need, the connection works fine. If you enter the connection details into /etc/network/interfaces it will connect fine

2008-11-25T14:16:00.000Z	zetheroo	ActionParsnip1	will it? cause it looks like the card sees nothing unless I manually refresh the wireless networks list
2008-11-25T14:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zetheroo	that will help ^
2008-11-25T14:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zetheroo	maybe adding the command to sudo iwlist scan will help (not graceful but may solve it)
2009-04-30T16:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zetheroo	wassup?
2009-04-30T16:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zetheroo	apt-get has never failed me yet, its all i sue
2009-04-30T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zetheroo	can you expand on that
