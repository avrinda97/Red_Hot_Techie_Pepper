2009-02-09T08:35:00.000Z	Aster0ID		will Ubuntu recognise and charge my iphone?
2009-02-09T08:37:00.000Z	nDuff	Aster0ID	it recognizes mine as a camera
2009-02-09T08:38:00.000Z	Aster0ID	nDuff	does it charge it then?
2009-02-09T08:38:00.000Z	nDuff	Aster0ID	yup
2009-02-09T08:38:00.000Z	Aster0ID	nDuff	what do you do when you want to sync to itunes ?
2009-02-09T08:38:00.000Z	nDuff	Aster0ID	use my Windows box at home
2009-02-09T08:39:00.000Z	nDuff	Aster0ID	...if I didn't have one, I'd probably set it up for USB passthrough to a Windows instance running in VirtualBox.
2009-02-09T08:40:00.000Z	nDuff	Aster0ID	I don't use it for games or anything, but sure.
2009-02-09T08:40:00.000Z	Aster0ID	nDuff	ok, thanks
2009-02-09T08:40:00.000Z	nDuff	Aster0ID	...btw, while VirtualBox is ideal for desktop VMs, if you're going to be virtualizing servers or doing automated QA or somesuch, you might do well to look at KVM instead.
2009-02-09T08:41:00.000Z	Aster0ID	nDuff	I would just need virtual vista to do some rare stuff
2009-02-09T08:42:00.000Z	nDuff	Aster0ID	...yar, vbox should be fine for that; I keep it around on my work system for running Outlook and the occasional bit of win32 client testing, and it does that just fine.
2009-02-09T08:49:00.000Z	nDuff	Aster0ID	upgrade to a newer one :)
2009-02-09T08:49:00.000Z	nDuff	Aster0ID	the upgrade process is shiny and clicky and automated.
2009-02-09T08:49:00.000Z	Aster0ID	nDuff	Upgrade would mean reinstalling the OS?
2009-02-09T08:49:00.000Z	nDuff	Aster0ID	no, it means clicking a few buttons.
2009-02-09T08:50:00.000Z	nDuff	Aster0ID	...and letting the OS reinstall all the components that changed.
2009-02-09T08:50:00.000Z	Aster0ID	nDuff	what is the version of the ubuntu on default download site? is it KDE ubuntu or Gnome?
2009-02-09T08:50:00.000Z	nDuff	Aster0ID	default Ubuntu uses GNOME.
2009-02-09T08:51:00.000Z	Aster0ID	nDuff	switching to KDE would not be much trouble I would assume?
2009-02-09T08:51:00.000Z	nDuff	Aster0ID	I don't know how much trouble is involved in switching between distribution variants, but I'd be surprised if it were very tricky.
2009-02-09T08:51:00.000Z	nDuff	Aster0ID	both should work.
