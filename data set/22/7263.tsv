2007-10-04T07:48:00.000Z	Lars_G		Good dayll.
2007-10-04T07:48:00.000Z	Lars_G		errr
2007-10-04T07:48:00.000Z	Lars_G		good day all.
2007-10-04T07:48:00.000Z	Lars_G		better
2007-10-04T07:50:00.000Z	Lars_G		Since a dist-upgrade is a dist-upgrade, would it be too mad to dist-upgrade directly from hoary to feisty?
2007-10-04T07:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Lars_G	it wouldn't work
2007-10-04T07:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Lars_G	I don't even think you can do that
2008-07-09T04:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Lars_G	too late
2008-07-09T04:57:00.000Z	Lars_G	ikonia	?
2008-07-09T04:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Lars_G	if you've already installed it, you've already broke the dependencies
2008-07-09T04:57:00.000Z	Lars_G	ikonia	???
2008-07-09T04:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Lars_G	yes ?
2008-07-09T04:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Lars_G	no, if it is linked against anything on the ubuntu system
2008-07-09T04:58:00.000Z	Lars_G	ikonia	not in this case. no
2008-07-09T04:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Lars_G	and it doesn't replace any ubuntu files
2008-07-09T05:00:00.000Z	Lars_G	ikonia	Anyhow I think you're wrong here.
2008-07-09T05:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Lars_G	if your install touches any of the ubuntu files/repalces them, or links against any ubuntu files, or anything links against it, your package managment will be out of sync
2008-07-09T05:02:00.000Z	Lars_G	ikonia	still if my install replaces any ubuntu provided executables, and doesn't provides libraries other packages link against, it wouldn't break anything
2008-07-09T05:02:00.000Z	Lars_G	ikonia	I'm talking stuff like JVMs and the like, on this particular case, a ruby install
2008-07-09T05:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Lars_G	of course it will, your binary will be linked against the ubuntu libs, so when ubuntu updates its libs - it will break
2008-07-09T05:03:00.000Z	Lars_G	ikonia	depending on the level it's linked against. yes I might have to recompile the program if I update my libs, but with the placeholder at least it wouldn't be a block for modules
2008-07-09T05:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Lars_G	no, modules should be fine
