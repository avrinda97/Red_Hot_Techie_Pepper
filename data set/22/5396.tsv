2007-07-03T10:48:00.000Z	bloodytux		Can someone help, my pc was working fine until a couple nights ago when I installed Ubuntu. Now my hard drive becomes un readable, grub is gone, everything just disappeared. Any ideas on how to fix it?
2007-07-03T10:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	Were you dual booting?
2007-07-03T10:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	What else did you install and how did you install it.. Hint Automatix is a BAD thing..
2007-07-03T10:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	Did it ever work?
2007-07-03T10:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	Did both systems ever work after the install
2007-07-03T10:51:00.000Z	bloodytux	Jack_Sparrow	Yea, up until last night when it booted up, it booted to windows and it had a disk checker but it froze so I rebooted and now it says to insert a diskette into A: because it cant find the primary master.
2007-07-03T10:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	You can fdisk /mbr to make sure you have XP then go back and fix grub
2007-07-03T10:52:00.000Z	bloodytux	Jack_Sparrow	How?
2007-07-03T10:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	boot to a MS command prompt then type fdisk /mbr
2007-07-03T10:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	what happens when you only type fdisk?
2007-07-03T10:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	NOt that hard to fix... dont get frustrated and go through a couple hours work for nothing
2007-07-03T10:56:00.000Z	bloodytux	Jack_Sparrow	it says to type fdisk /dev/hda or fdisk /dev/sda etc.
2007-07-03T10:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	Are you running an SATA drive? do you have a usb drive or flash memory installed?
2007-07-03T10:57:00.000Z	bloodytux	Jack_Sparrow	No, no. Just a 40GB WD IDE HD
2007-07-03T10:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	You have a bootable floppy?
2007-07-03T10:58:00.000Z	bloodytux	Jack_Sparrow	I have a drive and blank floppies but no bootables
2007-07-03T10:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	Wrong
2007-07-03T10:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	You didnt read what I said...
2007-07-03T11:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	Your Ubuntu is working?  Is that the terminal?
2007-07-03T11:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	If you are already running live, then read the earlier link for fixing grub
2007-07-03T11:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	not a brub boot floppy
2007-07-03T11:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	bloodytux	Patience...
