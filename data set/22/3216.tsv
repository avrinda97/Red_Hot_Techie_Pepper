2009-05-25T15:01:00.000Z	TheAncientGoat		All with different mice
2009-05-25T15:01:00.000Z	TheAncientGoat		And operating systems :/
2009-05-25T15:02:00.000Z	TheAncientGoat		On my laptop, without any mouse plugged in, running vista, it sometimes happens
2009-05-25T15:02:00.000Z	TheAncientGoat		The mouse goes to the language settings and tries to click on it..
2009-05-25T15:03:00.000Z	TheAncientGoat		On my kde box, all my widgets were systematically deleted once..
2009-05-25T15:04:00.000Z	TheAncientGoat		And now my stepfather just said that the mouse was moving around and clicking stuff on the ubuntu box..
2009-05-25T15:05:00.000Z	TheAncientGoat		No, serial optical mouse
2009-05-25T15:05:00.000Z	TheAncientGoat		And a usb optical mouse..
2009-05-25T15:07:00.000Z	TheAncientGoat		showing the same symtoms on different oses
2009-05-25T15:07:00.000Z	TheAncientGoat		And lets say there is good reason for my pc's to get cracked..
2009-05-25T15:09:00.000Z	owh	TheAncientGoat	Huh?
2009-05-25T15:04:00.000Z	owh	TheAncientGoat	That would be a wireless optical mouse?
2009-05-25T15:06:00.000Z	owh	TheAncientGoat	Well, it could be a dud mouse. I had phantom clicks on an ancient MS mouse. Replace mouse, problem gone.
2009-05-25T15:06:00.000Z	TheAncientGoat	owh	These are 3 different mice on 3 different pc's, one being a trackpad
2009-05-25T15:07:00.000Z	owh	TheAncientGoat	It's possible that you're touching the trackpad.
2009-05-25T15:08:00.000Z	owh	TheAncientGoat	Well, you could run a LiveCD and see if the problem continues.
2009-05-25T15:08:00.000Z	owh	TheAncientGoat	It depends on how paranoid you are.
2009-05-25T15:08:00.000Z	TheAncientGoat	owh	No, because I have to wrestle with the thing until I plug out the lan cable
2009-05-25T15:09:00.000Z	TheAncientGoat	owh	It doesn't happen when I boot into ubuntu on my laptop
2009-05-25T15:10:00.000Z	owh	TheAncientGoat	Well, then it sounds like a compromised machine, or someone using RDP, or VNC, or some other remote control protocol.
2009-05-25T15:10:00.000Z	owh	TheAncientGoat	It need not be VNC, it could be RDP.
2009-05-25T15:11:00.000Z	owh	TheAncientGoat	It could also be some trojan running that connects to somewhere remotely and is letting someone else it.
