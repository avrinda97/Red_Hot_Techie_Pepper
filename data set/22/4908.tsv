2008-05-08T04:00:00.000Z	spanther		so yeah most things wont work without their drivers :)
2008-05-08T04:02:00.000Z	tommy	spanther	what are your qualifications to make such a statement?
2008-05-08T04:03:00.000Z	spanther	tommy	i just tried alot of hardware things so i found out it myself so i dont need "qualifications" or other brands lol xD
2008-05-08T04:04:00.000Z	tommy	spanther	hehe ok ;)
2008-05-08T04:05:00.000Z	spanther	tommy	but most microsoft hardware (keyboards and mouses) except of these older standard ones dont work completely sure microsoft has no problems with that because they give out drivers for their products for windows so yeah they dont care x.x but speedlink or logitech is a better choice for mouse and keyboard
2008-05-08T04:06:00.000Z	tommy	spanther	ok makes sense
2008-05-08T04:07:00.000Z	spanther	tommy	they dont build them with standards they build them how they like to design it and they build their own chips inside of their mouses so most dont work with all buttons at linux cause there are no drivers for linux given out from microsoft :) only left and right button has standard or maybe mousewheel too (sometimes) at microsoft mouses
2008-05-08T04:08:00.000Z	spanther	tommy	 microsoft ever wants to make their own standards you know that hehe :)
2008-05-08T04:09:00.000Z	tommy	spanther	hehe
2008-05-08T04:10:00.000Z	tommy	spanther	ask virtuald , he sounds like he may have a solution
2008-05-08T04:10:00.000Z	spanther	tommy	with internet explorer 7 they tried to make their own standards for websites too but now IE7 just works crappy at some pages and FF or opera is much better now :) IE7 crashes at some pages lol just a stupid build xD
2008-05-08T04:11:00.000Z	tommy	spanther	yeah I only use FF with noscript and refcontrol add-on
2008-05-08T04:11:00.000Z	spanther	tommy	noscript is the best security tool to browse websites without letting evil code run :D
2008-05-08T04:12:00.000Z	spanther	tommy	i've visited virus infected sites once to test noscript it worked very well i have no problems its faster and no virus alerts xD
2008-05-08T04:12:00.000Z	spanther	tommy	what did you mean when you wrote that virtuald  would have a solution? a solution for what? :)
2008-05-08T04:13:00.000Z	tommy	spanther	for trebel
2008-05-08T04:14:00.000Z	spanther	tommy	surely most microsoft mouses you can get to work much better with some workarounds then more buttons work but hell yeah :) its just a hassle to use these hardware at linux better go get other brands who follow real standards so that linux supports them 100%
2008-05-08T04:15:00.000Z	tommy	spanther	I use ubuntu, but I use vista sometimes when I want to play BF2142 :)
2008-05-08T04:16:00.000Z	spanther	tommy	with XP you have better performanced OS whats grown more cause its 7 years old and well fixed yeah and it doesnt have so much DRM checks in kernel or other things what slow down your comp more than needed hehe
2008-05-08T04:19:00.000Z	spanther	tommy	but don't worry i don't know everything too :) i just know alot of things i've tried before but yeah i am not perfect too ^^
2008-05-08T04:19:00.000Z	tommy	spanther	that applies to us all ;) hehe
2008-05-08T04:20:00.000Z	spanther	tommy	i just wanted to be sure that you don't think i talk alot and know less everything i saw i definitively know too 100% otherwise i would say "i think" or say nothing :P
