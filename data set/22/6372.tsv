2007-10-13T14:56:00.000Z	novato_br	FallenHitokiri	plz, when i try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, it says that will be remove alot office package and i need this package, what can I do ?
2007-10-13T14:58:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	novato_br	maybe because of depences. ubuntu-desktop is a meta-package. after updating / installing you can remove it and install your office pakcages again or you just install the packages you need and ubuntu-desktop referes to

2007-10-13T14:59:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	novato_br	some days, you can already upgreade, beta should be stable
2007-10-14T14:14:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	novato_br	what filesystem is on your mp4?
2007-10-14T14:14:00.000Z	novato_br	FallenHitokiri	it's vfat, i think
2007-10-14T14:15:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	novato_br	can you create a directory with sudo mkdir /path/to/mp4/mountpoint ?
2007-10-14T14:15:00.000Z	novato_br	FallenHitokiri	on windows, the mp4, it's works
2007-10-14T14:15:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	novato_br	do you need a seperate driver?
2007-10-14T14:16:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	novato_br	yeah if you use it in windows
2007-10-14T14:16:00.000Z	novato_br	FallenHitokiri	but my mp4 it's "generic" like we called by here
2007-10-14T14:18:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	novato_br	I have no idea. I don't know the player, root cannot create a directory which means that you also cannot chmod what would be useless because vfat has no real permission management,...
2007-10-14T14:18:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	novato_br	what does mount say?
2007-10-14T14:19:00.000Z	novato_br	FallenHitokiri	i don't need the mount the mp4
2007-10-14T14:19:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	novato_br	i repeat: what does mount say
2007-10-14T14:19:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	novato_br	did you enter the command in a terminal?
2007-10-14T14:20:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	novato_br	now open a terminal and enter mount or solve your problem by your own
2007-10-14T14:21:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	novato_br	I know what hal is and I know how hal interacts with dbus. that changes _nothing_ on the fact that I want the output of mount
2007-10-14T14:21:00.000Z	novato_br	FallenHitokiri	i won't offend you
2007-10-14T14:22:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	novato_br	you, at 10am I don't like telling people one command 5 times and they just ignore me and lecture me because they don't know what it does
