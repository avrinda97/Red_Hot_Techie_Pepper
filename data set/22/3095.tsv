2011-09-02T00:10:00.000Z	kid		it was setup before i got the job and i know a miniscule amount of networking. i just moved the box and plugged hoping it would play.
2011-09-02T00:11:00.000Z	kid		when i plug it, the computers can find it, they locate the server, however i'm stuck at the "connecting" stage.
2011-09-02T00:11:00.000Z	kid		i cannot enter my user/password.
2011-09-02T00:12:00.000Z	qin	kid	Your server, do you have phisical contact with it?
2011-09-02T00:12:00.000Z	kid	qin	it does.
2011-09-02T00:13:00.000Z	kid		it's simply a local server which allows us to network in house and work with the same files.
2011-09-02T00:14:00.000Z	kid		it times out and gives me a "connection failed. the server may not exsist or it is not operational at this time. check the server name or IP address and your network connection and try again." error
2011-09-02T00:14:00.000Z	qin	kid	And now you hanging on same lan what server?
2011-09-02T00:15:00.000Z	kid	qin	not following.
2011-09-02T00:15:00.000Z	qin	kid	Are you in work or home?
2011-09-02T00:16:00.000Z	kid		in work
2011-09-02T00:17:00.000Z	kid		i feel like it's something pretty simple. nothing complex. it's worked forever and we simply moved locations and now cannot connect.
2011-09-02T00:17:00.000Z	kid		if i get onto the server itself, i can connect to it with my personal computers password/un. however, i cannot connect to the server with my computer.
2011-09-02T00:17:00.000Z	qin	kid	Ok, make sure server is up (power up), what isconnected to network (lan port with light), do your server have rgb port for monitor?
2011-09-02T00:18:00.000Z	kid		yes. plugged up monitor and keyboard.
2011-09-02T00:19:00.000Z	qin	kid	In server: ifconfig, check in clients configuration, ip you got from ifconfig on server.
2011-09-02T00:19:00.000Z	kid	qin	how would i do so?
2011-09-02T00:19:00.000Z	kid		i know nothing. i'm the web developer and network guy can't be in until next week.
2011-09-02T00:20:00.000Z	qin	kid	On server: ifconfig, sudo netstat -tulp (to see what is running there)
2011-09-02T00:23:00.000Z	kid		ifconfig worked, showed a bunch of stuff. the other didn't because i don't have sudo pw.
2011-09-02T00:29:00.000Z	qin	kid	Did you get IP from ifconfig?
2011-09-02T00:29:00.000Z	qin	kid	Ang highlight nick. please
