2012-01-28T11:32:00.000Z	bobo37773	Jeremy3D	Calm down buddy. Your problem is that you cannot reset your monitor resolution or what?
2012-01-28T11:33:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	bobo37773	not sure what the deal is but ever since i changed the resolution for the tv, now my regular monitor is weird
2012-01-28T11:33:00.000Z	bobo37773	Jeremy3D	Are you using mutliple monitors simultaneously? Or switching back and forth?
2012-01-28T11:35:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	bobo37773	i was switching but i've given up on using the tv as a monitor;. gonna just stick to the one for now
2012-01-28T11:35:00.000Z	bobo37773	Jeremy3D	ok and the one you switched back too does not have the resolution you want. Is that correct?
2012-01-28T11:36:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	bobo37773	correct. it seems to be set right but my folders, menus, etc are in a gray scale and i get an error message when i first log on
2012-01-28T11:37:00.000Z	bobo37773	Jeremy3D	Grey scale? Are you using nvidia or ati? Open source or binary?
2012-01-28T11:38:00.000Z	bobo37773	Jeremy3D	By binary I mean the binary blob (proprietary driver)
2012-01-28T11:38:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	bobo37773	ati amdcccle
2012-01-28T11:41:00.000Z	bobo37773	Jeremy3D	Are you using catalyst or the open source driver?
2012-01-28T11:42:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	bobo37773	catalyst
2012-01-28T11:42:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	bobo37773	when i open it the multi-display tab is highlighted and the only option is Single Display Desktop (Multi-Desktop)
2012-01-28T11:43:00.000Z	bobo37773	Jeremy3D	Is it a laptop?
2012-01-28T11:43:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	bobo37773	no desktop. and Default button is grayed out
2012-01-28T11:46:00.000Z	bobo37773	Jeremy3D	Try to reset resolution in a terminal with xrandr. Do you know what the resolution is suppose to be?
2012-01-28T11:49:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	bobo37773	yes
2012-01-28T11:49:00.000Z	bobo37773	Jeremy3D	What is it?
2012-01-28T11:51:00.000Z	bobo37773	Jeremy3D	Maybe you need to create a new Xorg.conf
2012-01-28T11:52:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	bobo37773	alright well that's for another time. thanks for the help, i need to hit the hay
