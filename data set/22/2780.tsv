2009-05-18T22:36:00.000Z	doc_brown		im trying to get java working in the opera browser.  Will i have more luck downloading the rpm.bin?  or just the .bin (self extracting file)?
2009-05-18T22:37:00.000Z	doc_brown		i know rpm + alien = .deb
2009-05-18T22:37:00.000Z	doc_brown		can i work with bin files easily?
2009-05-18T22:38:00.000Z	doc_brown		how easy is it to work with bin files on ubuntu?
2009-05-18T22:39:00.000Z	doc_brown		=)
2009-05-18T22:39:00.000Z	doc_brown		how can i get java working in the opera browser?
2009-05-18T22:40:00.000Z	doc_brown		i guess i am confused as to where java installs.  into the OS, or into the browser?
2009-05-18T22:42:00.000Z	Breetai	doc_brown	 java installs in the OS in /usr/lib/java but there is also a browser plugin. When you use a web page that has java on it, it uses the browser plugin which relies on the copy of java on the system.
2009-05-18T22:42:00.000Z	doc_brown	Breetai	thank you
2009-05-18T22:42:00.000Z	Breetai		doc_brown:You can also run java programs such as limewire, or jbidwatcher directly on the OS, using the copy of java that is installed on the system
2009-05-18T22:43:00.000Z	Breetai	doc_brown	you are welcome.
2009-05-18T22:43:00.000Z	doc_brown	Breetai	makes perfect sense now
2009-05-18T22:43:00.000Z	doc_brown		i guess i need a java plugin for opera
2009-05-18T22:43:00.000Z	Breetai	doc_brown	installing ubuntu-restriced-extras will get it for you.
2009-05-18T22:43:00.000Z	doc_brown		!ubuntu-restricted-extras
2009-05-18T22:44:00.000Z	Breetai	doc_brown	or you need to get opera to use the current plugin. There is usually a list of plugin paths. I.E. seach /usr/lib/mozilla /usr/lib/firefox, ~/.mozilla, etc.
2009-05-18T22:44:00.000Z	Breetai	doc_brown	or you can copy the plugin into the opera plugins folder, either the system wide one your the one in your home directory.
2009-05-18T22:46:00.000Z	doc_brown	Breetai	/usr/lib/opera/plugins is empty
2009-05-18T22:46:00.000Z	doc_brown		shall i download the .bin and move it into that folder?
2009-05-18T22:50:00.000Z	Breetai	doc_brown	locate libjavaplugin
2009-05-18T22:51:00.000Z	Breetai	doc_brown	then you can do a sudo -l /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.13/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so /usr/lib/opera/plugins
2009-05-18T22:53:00.000Z	Breetai	doc_brown	try this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=69275
