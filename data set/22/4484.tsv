2008-02-14T07:52:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	Did you catch that?
2008-02-14T08:00:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	You install things in Ubuntu with aptitude.
2008-02-14T08:00:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	"sudo aptitude install rsyslog" sounds like a winner.
2008-02-14T08:00:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	Google is also your very best friend.

2008-02-14T08:02:00.000Z	FLUXxXx	rpj8	lol do i look that stupid..? don't answer that
2008-02-14T08:02:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	Well then you should wait until 8.04 :)
2008-02-14T08:02:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	Since it's not officially supported, you're going to have a butt load of problems.
2008-02-14T08:03:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	If you're still bullheaded and want to install it anyway, you could try building from source.
2008-02-14T08:03:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	Adding hardy repos won't... help./
2008-02-14T08:03:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	Hardy repos assume you have other dependencies, which you don't.
2008-02-14T08:03:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	What's the problem with just waiting for hardy?
2008-02-14T08:04:00.000Z	FLUXxXx	rpj8	i just bought a router which has an option to use SYSLOG. and i want to install and configure rsyslog to capture the router's LOG
2008-02-14T08:04:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	 Look at what nickrud said. I'd say the same thing.
2008-02-14T08:18:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	There are a .... TON of .config files.
2008-02-14T08:18:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	Which one are you looking for specifically.
2008-02-14T08:20:00.000Z	FLUXxXx	rpj8	i'm looking for the currently running kernel .config
2008-02-14T08:20:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	I guess I don't. Either I just am not that advanced or you have no idea what you're talking about
2008-02-14T08:22:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	I would guess debug isn't exactly 'standard' if it's not in the generic kernel
2008-02-14T08:23:00.000Z	FLUXxXx	rpj8	got it
2008-02-14T08:23:00.000Z	rpj8	FLUXxXx	No worries
