2005-08-28T11:49:00.000Z	adriyel		especially math heavy stuff
2005-08-28T11:49:00.000Z	adriyel		the encode/decode times are NICE
2005-08-28T11:49:00.000Z	adriyel		I am in love with audio/video on this thing
2005-08-28T11:50:00.000Z	adriyel		I could turn this thing into an audio studio...
2005-08-28T11:50:00.000Z	adriyel		the 64bit version?
2005-08-28T11:50:00.000Z	adriyel		no, to run 64bit you need an athlon64 or an intel with EMT64
2005-08-28T11:51:00.000Z	adriyel		typically a Xeon, or that other lineup
2005-08-28T11:51:00.000Z	adriyel		*shrugs* it said 64 after all :P
2005-08-28T11:51:00.000Z	adriyel		get a dual core athlon64 machine
2005-08-28T11:51:00.000Z	adriyel		that would be a DREAM
2005-08-28T11:51:00.000Z	fab_	adriyel	:D
2005-08-28T11:51:00.000Z	adriyel		I don't like intel, so xeon's make me lurch
2005-08-28T11:51:00.000Z	adriyel	mihai	doesn't gigabyte have a converter
2005-08-28T11:53:00.000Z	adriyel		I dunno, just heard a rumor that gigabyte had a special mobo
2005-08-28T11:53:00.000Z	adriyel		yeah, I suspected so
2005-08-28T11:53:00.000Z	adriyel		FUCK
2005-08-28T11:53:00.000Z	adriyel		delire
2005-08-28T11:53:00.000Z	adriyel		Firefox crashed again Delire
2005-08-28T11:54:00.000Z	fab_	adriyel	that's weird
2005-08-28T11:54:00.000Z	adriyel		meh, it randomly crashes
2005-08-28T11:54:00.000Z	adriyel		it was doing this earlier
2005-08-28T11:54:00.000Z	fab_	adriyel	I have never seen FireFox crashing
