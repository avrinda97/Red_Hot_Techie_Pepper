2011-05-10T20:56:00.000Z	itilious		is it unsafe to add a user to the www-data group to be able to write to the /var/www directory?
2011-05-10T20:57:00.000Z	itilious		i've ready many forum postings that say this is a solution to FTP into apache html folder,,, but others say this is a big security risk,, anyone have any tips for me?
2011-05-10T20:59:00.000Z	itilious		is it not recommended for a n00b to linux to be setting up ftp access to live webserver on ubuntu 10.04 machine?
2011-05-10T21:01:00.000Z	itilious		either there's no replies for the seamingly less secure methods, or rarely some one says its not safe to use the method suggested
2011-05-10T21:03:00.000Z	itilious		it seems this would be unsafe because it seems i'm giving admin control to the web server which is open to internet
2011-05-10T21:05:00.000Z	itilious		both give me permission denied errors when i try to edit
2011-05-10T21:07:00.000Z	usr13	itilious	Best to just set up users for each account and then symlink the folder you want to serve to the /var/www folder.
2011-05-10T21:07:00.000Z	usr13	itilious	httpd.conf by default has FollwoSymlink  enabled
2011-05-10T21:08:00.000Z	usr13	itilious	So you can do -l /home/itilious/html /var/www/My-WebSite
2011-05-10T21:09:00.000Z	usr13	itilious	So you can do ln -s /home/itilious/html /var/www/My-WebSite
2011-05-10T21:10:00.000Z	itilious	usr13	i instantly did a search on symlink when you said that and was about to ask if that very command is waht i need :)
2011-05-10T21:10:00.000Z	usr13	itilious	And then you should see http://localhost/My-WebSite
2011-05-10T21:10:00.000Z	itilious	usr13	i've been looking for this forever and just simply couldnt find out the search terms i needed to find the solution, thanks so much:)
2011-05-10T21:10:00.000Z	usr13	itilious	np
2011-05-10T21:12:00.000Z	itilious	usr13	is this option permanent tho?
2011-05-10T21:16:00.000Z	itilious	usr13	i ran the command but nothign is showing up in the folder
2011-05-10T21:19:00.000Z	usr13	itilious	I was using hypothetical values. You need to put your own dir names in those places.  Right?  Show me the command you used...
2011-05-10T21:31:00.000Z	usr13	itilious	It will also take admin privileges to symlink into /var/www so you will need to preface the command with sudo
2011-06-16T03:15:00.000Z	usr13	itilious	Usually, no.
2011-06-16T03:16:00.000Z	usr13	itilious	But, what you really need to do is access it's media.  Right?
2011-06-16T03:16:00.000Z	itilious	usr13	yes
2011-06-16T03:17:00.000Z	usr13	itilious	I mostly just use a card reader.
