2006-03-08T11:27:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	lgc	nope, they all have their own sources.
2006-03-08T11:30:00.000Z	lgc	nalioth_zZz	you are right. Yet I still can get what I want from "info" ("info fprintf" or "info int" still don't work).
2006-04-25T12:54:00.000Z	lgc	nalioth_zZz	I suppose I should reboot now, shouldn't I?
2006-04-25T12:54:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	lgc	nope
2006-04-25T12:54:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	lgc	you almost never have to reboot a linux system
2006-04-25T12:55:00.000Z	lgc	nalioth_zZz	How about that! So the changes are in effect? Let me see then...
2006-04-25T12:57:00.000Z	lgc	nalioth_zZz	doesn't work and doesn't even let me log out of the graphical session!
2006-04-25T12:58:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	lgc	go to your terminal and type "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart" (you will lose this irc session) or ctrl-alt-bkspace (you will lose this irc session)
2006-04-25T12:59:00.000Z	lgc	nalioth_zZz	this is a text session, so I won't lose it. I am restarting via brute force...
2006-04-25T13:00:00.000Z	lgc	nalioth_zZz	it says the gnome kbd settings differ from those of the X sys settings. Which one should prevail?
2006-04-25T13:03:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	lgc	do you use gnome more than anything else?
2006-04-25T13:03:00.000Z	lgc	nalioth_zZz	so far yes. I mean I don't have KDE installed...
2006-04-25T13:04:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	lgc	then try the gnome settings
2006-04-25T13:06:00.000Z	lgc	nalioth_zZz	romulo, didn't work! The kbd is still dead!
2006-04-25T13:09:00.000Z	lgc	nalioth_zZz	with X setting it DOES work!
2006-04-25T13:11:00.000Z	lgc	nalioth_zZz	you awake?
2006-04-25T13:11:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	lgc	muy bien!
2006-04-25T13:12:00.000Z	lgc	nalioth_zZz	only thing is, with the other user I chose Gnome settings and it didn't work. How can I revert the settings to be those of X?
2006-04-25T13:13:00.000Z	nalioth_zZz	lgc	use the settings that work  System > preferences > keyboard
2006-04-25T13:13:00.000Z	lgc	nalioth_zZz	thanks!
2006-04-25T13:20:00.000Z	lgc	nalioth_zZz	It's working fine now! Thanks a million, man!
2006-04-25T13:22:00.000Z	lgc	nalioth_zZz	I'm off for tonight. Again: Muchas gracias!!
