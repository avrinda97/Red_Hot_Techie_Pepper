2007-07-06T13:49:00.000Z	Ricket		When I go into standby and then turn my computer back on, it goes to a black screen with a weird pixelation around the mouse (a rectangle, slightly bigger than the cursor) and I can move the mouse but the rectangle stays where it was and nothing happens. I can't restart X server, I can't press any keys, nothing - only moving the mouse. What is wrong? How can it be fixed?
2007-07-06T13:50:00.000Z	jlund	Ricket	What video driver are you using?
2007-07-06T13:50:00.000Z	Ricket	jlund	nvidia
2007-07-06T13:51:00.000Z	Ricket		lol @ Lacrymology
2007-07-06T13:52:00.000Z	jlund	Ricket	I think that may be your problem there. I could never get Suspend to work when using the nvidia closed-source driver. When I use the generic 2d-only nv driver then it works just fine.
2007-07-06T13:52:00.000Z	Ricket	jlund	well, crap. I can't really get rid of the driver, I like games....... :(
2007-07-06T13:54:00.000Z	jlund	Ricket	I feel your pain man. I just keep hoping that one day Nvidia or ATI will actually release a card with open specifications so we can get REAL open source drivers for Linux. This is also why I LOVE working on laptops and systems with Intel video chipsets in them because you just don't have these weird problems.
2007-07-06T13:54:00.000Z	jlund	Ricket	I even tried to see if Nvidia had a bugzilla or something where I could report it but I didn't have any luck. It is kind of up to them to fix it though.
2007-07-06T13:54:00.000Z	Ricket	jlund	this is a laptop, lol. :) (Nvidia Geforce Go 7900GS)
2007-07-06T13:56:00.000Z	jlund	Ricket	Yeah Intel's chips are super slow compared to that card (which is quite nice!) but they have open drivers at least.
2007-07-06T13:57:00.000Z	Ricket	jlund	well at least I still have Vista to play games with. I'm not going to change the driver... I guess I will just not standby when I'm on Ubuntu. I don't use Ubuntu much anyway, cause of problems like this all over the place.. Ubuntu is certainly getting better, but it doesn't even come close to the "just works" capability of Windows XP and Vista.
2007-07-06T13:58:00.000Z	jlund	Ricket	This is primarily the fault of your video card and its manufacturer. I use Linux exclusively on my laptop without any issues at all.
2007-07-06T13:59:00.000Z	Ricket		What drivers do the Dell Linux laptops ship with? This is an E1705, there were some Ubuntu E1705s shipped and I wonder if they had the same problems??
2007-07-06T14:00:00.000Z	Ricket		Oh they probably had the default video drivers, not nvidia
2007-07-06T14:00:00.000Z	jlund	Ricket	No, they don't because they use Intel video chipsets and Intel wireless cards. Intel has fully open sourced drivers for both.
2007-07-06T14:01:00.000Z	Ricket	jlund	The Intel was the lowest choice, they also shipped with X1400s and 7900GS's
2007-07-06T14:01:00.000Z	jlund	Ricket	Intel's drivers also do 3d but you're right the performance isn't as good. But it is worth the sacrifice to have better system stability because developers can actually troubleshoot problems.
2007-07-06T14:01:00.000Z	Ricket	jlund	Also, there was a choice for a Dell wireless card - unfortunately, I chose it (because it has draft N, unlike Intel)
2007-07-06T14:02:00.000Z	Ricket	jlund	It's not worth the sacrifice if you want to do anything 3D-related.. I play games and also do a bit of 3D modeling, and I would not be able to stand an intel "accelerator" chip
2007-07-06T14:02:00.000Z	Ricket		lol
2007-07-06T14:03:00.000Z	Ricket		it accelerates memory usage
2007-07-06T14:03:00.000Z	jlund	Ricket	I really want you to know that I understand what you are saying and the frustration. I just want to help you realize that these aren't problems that Ubuntu can fix. The manufacturers of the video cards and wireless cards have total control. They either provide drivers or they don't. They either open source them or they don't. It isn't the fault of Ubuntu if they provide no drivers or provide poor drivers. That doesn't change your
