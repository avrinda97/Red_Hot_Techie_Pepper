2008-07-18T00:11:00.000Z	simotempler		hi there - gparted doesnt seem to have an option for ntfs is there any other program i might use
2008-07-18T00:12:00.000Z	Slart	simotempler	I think gparted can do ntfs.. you might have to install ntfs-3g first though
2008-07-18T00:18:00.000Z	simotempler	Slart	had ntfs-3g installed but gparted still doesnt do ntfs
2008-07-18T00:18:00.000Z	Slart	simotempler	are you trying to format a partition as ntfs?
2008-07-18T00:18:00.000Z	simotempler	Slart	yes
2008-07-18T00:19:00.000Z	Slart	simotempler	is the partition unmounted?
2008-07-18T00:20:00.000Z	Slart	simotempler	on gparted, the menu gparted, click on show features.. is ntfs listed there?
2008-07-18T00:21:00.000Z	simotempler	Slart	sorry
2008-07-18T00:21:00.000Z	Slart	simotempler	are you sure you've got ntfs-3g installed?
2008-07-18T00:22:00.000Z	Slart	simotempler	hmm.. hang on.. let me check something
2008-07-18T00:23:00.000Z	simotempler	Slart	is FAT16 or FAT32 a bad idea for a drive this large
2008-07-18T00:23:00.000Z	Slart	simotempler	how large is it?
2008-07-18T00:23:00.000Z	Slart	simotempler	fat32 should be ok.. it's not perfect but it's ok
2008-07-18T00:24:00.000Z	Slart	simotempler	fat16 is a very very bad idea
2008-07-18T00:24:00.000Z	Slart	simotempler	ah.. figured it out.. you need ntfsprogs installed too
2008-07-18T00:25:00.000Z	simotempler	Slart	checking now
2008-07-18T00:25:00.000Z	Slart	simotempler	so, sudo apt-get install ntfsprogs, restart gparted and it should be able to do ntfs just fine
2008-07-18T00:27:00.000Z	simotempler	Slart	- cheers bud works a treat now
2008-07-18T00:27:00.000Z	Slart	simotempler	you're welcome
2008-07-18T00:28:00.000Z	simotempler	Slart	one more question should i select create as primary partion or extended
2008-07-18T00:28:00.000Z	Slart	simotempler	primary unless you have more than 4 partitions on the drive
2008-07-18T00:29:00.000Z	Slart	simotempler	sure, go with primary
