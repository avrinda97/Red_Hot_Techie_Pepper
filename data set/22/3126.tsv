2008-11-29T11:35:00.000Z	Takuya		does anyone know how to route command-line output to a file?
2008-11-29T11:35:00.000Z	Takuya		stderr as well?
2008-11-29T11:35:00.000Z	Takuya		well I tried that..
2008-11-29T11:35:00.000Z	Takuya		lesse
2008-11-29T11:35:00.000Z	adam7_	Takuya	uptime > filename 2>&1 IIRC
2008-11-29T11:37:00.000Z	adam7_	Takuya	you have to do > filename before the 2>&1 filename
2008-11-29T11:37:00.000Z	adam7_	Takuya	all the &1 does it tell it to send the stderr to hte same place as > filename
2008-11-29T11:37:00.000Z	adam7_	Takuya	it should run but you won't be able to see the output
2008-11-29T11:38:00.000Z	adam7_	Takuya	hmm, then you have a problem :) try "tee"
2008-11-29T11:39:00.000Z	adam7_	Takuya	why do you need to redirect the envyng output if it is interactive
2008-11-29T11:39:00.000Z	Takuya	adam7_	it's like... erroring out and I can't see it.
2008-11-29T11:39:00.000Z	adam7_	Takuya	cause the ouptut is off the bottom of the screen?
2008-11-29T11:39:00.000Z	Takuya	adam7_	no it's at part of my screen where it is busted
2008-11-29T11:40:00.000Z	adam7_	Takuya	run the command, and when it completes, just press ctrl+c a bunch of times to move the ouput up the screen
2008-11-29T11:41:00.000Z	adam7_	Takuya	do you have another computer running ubuntu?
2008-11-29T11:41:00.000Z	adam7_	Takuya	or windows? another computer in general?
2008-11-29T11:41:00.000Z	adam7_	Takuya	yeah, that's what I was going to suggest ;)
2008-11-29T11:49:00.000Z	adam7_	Takuya	pgup scrolls irssi
2008-11-29T11:54:00.000Z	adam7_	Takuya	you can force apt to overwrite
2008-11-29T11:54:00.000Z	Takuya	adam7_	oh, how so?
2008-11-29T11:55:00.000Z	adam7_	Takuya	something like --force-overwrite or something, don't remember exactly
2008-11-29T11:58:00.000Z	adam7_	Takuya	do you have the deb on your computer? dpkg takes the --force-overwrite swithc, I think
