2006-01-06T09:25:00.000Z	brasko		I wonder if I didn't start the service
2006-01-06T09:27:00.000Z	brasko		yeah, the IP is good
2006-01-06T09:27:00.000Z	brasko		what's the name of the vnc server process?
2006-01-06T09:27:00.000Z	brasko		I could check to see if it's running
2006-01-06T09:27:00.000Z	brasko		yes
2006-01-06T09:27:00.000Z	brasko		the top 2 are checked, the bottom 2 unchecked
2006-01-06T09:28:00.000Z	brasko		Do you know what port vnc starts on ubuntu?
2006-01-06T09:28:00.000Z	brasko		I could use netstat -l?
2006-01-06T09:29:00.000Z	brasko		the client is windows xp home machine. realvnc.
2006-01-06T09:29:00.000Z	brasko		the server is newly installed ubuntu.
2006-01-06T09:29:00.000Z	timfrost	brasko	try 'netstat -nat' (the a to get the ports that are listening
2006-01-06T09:30:00.000Z	brasko		OK, nothing is listening, except on localhost
2006-01-06T09:30:00.000Z	brasko	pashaw	yes
2006-01-06T09:31:00.000Z	brasko		I suppose I didn't actually setup the vnc server properly
2006-01-06T09:31:00.000Z	brasko		looks like port 5900 should be listening?
2006-01-06T09:32:00.000Z	brasko	pashaw	definatly not, unless it does it by default
2006-01-06T09:32:00.000Z	brasko		I haven't done anything to this machine yet
2006-01-06T09:33:00.000Z	brasko		mostly cause the mouse doesn't work :)
2006-01-06T09:33:00.000Z	brasko		Yeah, the vnc server hasn't started
2006-01-06T09:33:00.000Z	brasko		http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/vnc/list/53313?page=last
2006-01-06T09:33:00.000Z	brasko		It says port 5900 should be listening
2006-01-06T09:33:00.000Z	timfrost	brasko	5900 is the correct port.
