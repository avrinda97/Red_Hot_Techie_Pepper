2006-11-14T10:50:00.000Z	Flannel		what is Eye of Gnome?
2006-11-14T10:51:00.000Z	bimberi	Flannel	default Ubuntu image viewer
2006-11-28T08:10:00.000Z	bimberi	Flannel	AnthonyG: build-essential and its dependencies are on the Desktop/Live CD as well - in a small repository
2006-11-28T08:10:00.000Z	Flannel	bimberi	since when does the desktop CD have a repository?
2006-11-28T08:10:00.000Z	bimberi	Flannel	since warty
2006-11-28T08:11:00.000Z	bimberi	Flannel	well, dapper if we're talking _Desktop_ CD :)
2006-11-28T08:11:00.000Z	Flannel	bimberi	ok, now.  That is obviously incorrect.  But still, I don't think there's a repository on Edgy anyway.
2006-11-28T08:12:00.000Z	bimberi	Flannel	check it out, there's a pool directory at the top level
2006-11-28T08:12:00.000Z	Flannel	bimberi	ah, righ.  See it on Edgy.  Ah, there it is on dapper too.  How odd.  They mustve added that in 6.06.1
2006-11-28T08:12:00.000Z	bimberi	Flannel	it's for stuff that's included but not installed by default
2006-11-28T08:13:00.000Z	bimberi	Flannel	it's on my old dapper CDs.
2006-11-28T08:13:00.000Z	Flannel	bimberi	not on mine.
2006-11-28T08:14:00.000Z	bimberi	Flannel	actually I'm not certain that it's on earlier releases
2006-11-28T08:14:00.000Z	bimberi	Flannel	are yours from shipit?
2006-11-28T08:14:00.000Z	Flannel	bimberi	well, obviously it's not on anything prior to dapper, since they were a liveCD only.  But, I don't believe it's on 6.06, no.  the iso.
2006-11-28T08:15:00.000Z	bimberi	Flannel	I have shipit cd's here, and it's there
2007-03-05T06:34:00.000Z	bimberi	Flannel	:)
2007-05-07T08:13:00.000Z	Flannel	bimberi	even without a destination?
2007-05-07T08:14:00.000Z	bimberi	Flannel	yep, it defaults to ./
2007-05-18T05:45:00.000Z	Flannel	bimberi	antum, sudo can do that too.
2007-05-18T05:46:00.000Z	bimberi	Flannel	yes I'm sure it does.  I just don't have the syntax at the top of my head.
2007-05-18T05:48:00.000Z	bimberi	Flannel	'sudo -u <username> startx'   I think :)
