2012-04-23T14:47:00.000Z	patr|ck		Hello. to be able to build an application i need "gdk_pixbuf-2.0" but i cant find that package in apt-cache - any tips please?
2012-04-23T14:49:00.000Z	christhisisgool	patr|ck	the package you are looking for is called libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev
2012-04-23T14:50:00.000Z	patr|ck	christhisisgool	this package does not exist on my Ubuntu 10.04
2012-04-23T14:50:00.000Z	christhisisgool		oh. in that case its probably because you are on an outdated system. ( not technically speaking, it still has some life left in it, but some packages are available only on the more up to date systems)
2012-04-23T14:51:00.000Z	christhisisgool		so if i were you i would either try and update your system, or i would just download the source code from somewhere.
2012-04-23T14:52:00.000Z	christhisisgool	patr|ck	i found a site that has the source code if you still need it: http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Libraries/gdk-pixbuf-58007.shtml
2012-04-23T14:52:00.000Z	patr|ck		thank you!
2012-04-23T14:52:00.000Z	christhisisgool		no problem
2012-04-23T14:54:00.000Z	patr|ck		oh, how do you untar *.xz files? *shy smile*
2012-04-23T14:55:00.000Z	christhisisgool		well, if you are using ubuntu there should be a extract here thing in nautilus. other wize just go into a terminal and type tar xvf <filename>
2012-04-23T14:55:00.000Z	christhisisgool		*wise
2012-04-23T14:56:00.000Z	patr|ck		archive type not supported, hmph
2012-04-23T14:56:00.000Z	christhisisgool		then just go into the terminal and untar it using tar xvf <filename>
2012-04-23T14:56:00.000Z	patr|ck		that wont work either
2012-04-23T14:57:00.000Z	christhisisgool		oh. do you have tar installed
2012-04-23T14:57:00.000Z	christhisisgool		?
2012-04-23T14:57:00.000Z	patr|ck		tar: xz: Cannot exec: No such file or directory
2012-04-23T14:57:00.000Z	patr|ck		it requires the binary for whatever the format handles
2012-04-23T14:58:00.000Z	christhisisgool	patr|ck	im not sure what the actual package name is, but its something along the line of xz utils
2012-04-23T14:58:00.000Z	patr|ck		lzma is the name i suppose?
2012-04-23T14:58:00.000Z	christhisisgool		so do apt-cache search xz-utils and then install it
2012-04-23T15:00:00.000Z	christhisisgool	patr|ck	btw, this appears to be a known bug. there are several bug reports on this issue. the solution is generally to actually install the xz utils
