2011-06-01T15:33:00.000Z	andeeeuk_		Hey ubuntu fans
2011-06-01T15:34:00.000Z	andeeeuk_		I have installed ubuntu with nautilus elementary but clutterflow is now working
2011-06-01T15:34:00.000Z	andeeeuk_		would anyone know why that could be?
2011-06-01T15:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	can you expand on "not working" please
2011-06-01T15:36:00.000Z	andeeeuk_	ActionParsnip	it in the menu but when you click on it nothing actually happens
2011-06-01T15:39:00.000Z	andeeeuk_	ActionParsnip	how can you ask it sto show output?
2011-06-01T15:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	it will happen when you run the command
2011-06-01T15:41:00.000Z	andeeeuk_	ActionParsnip	thats what i thought it would do also but it just opens and restars a new command
2011-08-30T00:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	never had an issue with it
2011-08-30T00:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	if you run:  smbtree    do you see the shares
2011-08-30T00:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	what OS is the sharing system?
2011-08-30T00:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	ok if you run smbtree on the server side, does it show its own shares?
2011-08-30T00:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	then your samba setup is not right
2011-08-30T00:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	as you have shared a file in home, you may want to run:  sudo smbpasswd -a andeeeuk    to set a samba password so you can authenticate
2011-08-30T00:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	here's mine: http://paste.ubuntu.com/677466/
2011-08-30T00:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	ok now when you connect you will be challenged and you can enter the credentials you just set
2011-08-30T00:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	all ok now?
2011-08-30T00:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	should work right away
2011-08-30T00:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	but are you asked for the credential?
2011-08-30T00:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	is the samba service even running on the server side?
2011-08-30T00:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	i'd check
2011-08-30T00:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	andeeeuk_	could reboot the server, just to be double sure
