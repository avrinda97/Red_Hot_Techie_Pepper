2004-11-27T10:46:00.000Z	Gwildor		ppc, 64 bit?
2004-11-27T10:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gwildor	yes I was concerned about the sudo thing too
2004-12-15T06:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gwildor	err... unzip <file> , oddly enough ;)
2004-12-15T06:34:00.000Z	Gwildor	thoreauputic	kk, thnx it is a .zip so unzip <file>will work
2004-12-15T06:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gwildor	yep, assuming unzip/zip is installed
2004-12-15T06:38:00.000Z	Gwildor	thoreauputic	it worked
2004-12-15T06:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gwildor	the wonders of Open Source ;-)
2004-12-15T07:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gwildor	I believe the pinboard feature is part of rox filer, which AFAIK only needs 2 debs - in fact I have them here if you're interested
2004-12-15T07:57:00.000Z	Gwildor	thoreauputic	slow is fine, if its fine with you....but could you help me set those up (if i need it) after they are done?
2004-12-15T07:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gwildor	It's been a while, but I think I could try, yeah
2004-12-15T07:58:00.000Z	Gwildor	thoreauputic	do you use it?
2004-12-15T07:58:00.000Z	Gwildor	thoreauputic	do you use it?
2004-12-15T07:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gwildor	not the pinboard, but the filer, yes
2004-12-15T07:59:00.000Z	Gwildor	thoreauputic	you will be sending me pinboard as well?
2004-12-15T07:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gwildor	I tried the pinboard, but it didn't suit my needs
2004-12-15T07:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gwildor	as I said, it's part of rox filer
2004-12-16T13:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gwildor	afaik shockwave isn't supported in Linux, but I'm not certain
2004-12-16T13:54:00.000Z	Gwildor	thoreauputic	it isnt.........grrrr
2004-12-16T13:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gwildor	btw, did you play with rox?
2004-12-16T13:56:00.000Z	Gwildor	thoreauputic	yeah, and i ended up not really liking it, xffm is fine for a filemanager, and the pinboard want what i really expected, but thank you
2004-12-16T13:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gwildor	OK :) Question of taste and needs, I guess
2004-12-16T13:57:00.000Z	Gwildor	thoreauputic	yeah, i just deciding that i really dont need the icons for the few folders i wanted pinboard for, so better without, but i think i may still play around with it, maybe i can manipulate to suite my needs?
