2007-01-27T15:37:00.000Z	Flannel	XNIT-01	#ubuntu-xgl, and read the topic there
2007-01-27T15:47:00.000Z	Flannel	XNIT-01	you need to enable universe first
2007-01-27T15:54:00.000Z	Flannel	XNIT-01	once you've enabled, reload, yeah
2007-01-27T16:26:00.000Z	Flannel	XNIT-01	~/Destkop (~ is your home folder)
2007-01-27T16:36:00.000Z	Flannel	XNIT-01	did you do it from a GUI or from the console?
2007-01-27T16:36:00.000Z	Flannel	XNIT-01	the trash can is in the bottom right corner (on the bottom menu bar)
2007-01-28T08:50:00.000Z	Flannel	XNIT-01	sudo apt-get install apache2
2007-01-28T08:53:00.000Z	Flannel	XNIT-01	/var/www
2007-01-28T08:55:00.000Z	Flannel	XNIT-01	unless you have a router, yeah.  (or if you have a router, and you've forwarded the correct port (80), then they can)
2007-01-28T08:57:00.000Z	Flannel	XNIT-01	yes.  No, they can't access your computer through it.  Yes, they can view your webfolder
2007-01-28T08:57:00.000Z	Flannel	XNIT-01	I can.  You have nothing in there.
2007-01-28T09:00:00.000Z	Flannel	XNIT-01	check out dyndns
2007-01-28T09:01:00.000Z	Flannel	XNIT-01	er, it's probably against your TOS, and isn't too feasible with a dynamic IP
