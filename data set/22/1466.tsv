2010-05-09T08:29:00.000Z	gogeta	UbuntuJeff	it may be around 80 these days due to osx
2010-05-09T08:30:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	gogeta	this is true, but I still love Linux over Windows. Only reason I still have Windows dual boot is my gaming needs. lol
2010-05-09T08:31:00.000Z	gogeta	UbuntuJeff	he and the other 10% of us love linux over windows to lol. its getting the non ech savy users over thats the roadblock netbook did give that a good push thow
2010-05-09T08:32:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	gogeta	true and dell with ubuntu installed on it. helps to
2010-05-09T08:33:00.000Z	gogeta	UbuntuJeff	i knoe windows users that think you have to pay for linux and never tryed it due to that
2010-05-09T08:34:00.000Z	gogeta	UbuntuJeff	and linux ads have never targeted to correct those misconceptions
2010-05-09T08:34:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	gogeta	thats just people that want to use the computer for internet and that, instead of putting forth some brain cells lol
2010-05-09T08:35:00.000Z	gogeta	UbuntuJeff	also those that never herd of it
2010-05-09T08:35:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	gogeta	curious, how long have you been using Linux?
2010-05-09T08:35:00.000Z	gogeta	UbuntuJeff	1995
2010-05-09T08:36:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	gogeta	I have been using it since like 2003 lol and I am sorry to the developers of Ubuntu, but I think replacing Pidgin with Empathy was a really bad idea, but thats just my opinion.
2010-05-09T08:36:00.000Z	gogeta	UbuntuJeff	it was a good idea for 9.04 due to its google talk voice support but pidgin has it now
2010-05-09T08:37:00.000Z	gogeta	UbuntuJeff	they should have put pidgin back now that it supports it and is just a cleaner app
2010-05-09T08:38:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	gogeta	I agree and on the topic of pidgin, why is the Message Notification in pidgin disabled by default? No! I don't want to know when I get a new message! lol
2010-05-09T08:38:00.000Z	gogeta	UbuntuJeff	you can turn that off threw pidgin preffs if you dont whant that
2010-05-09T08:39:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	gogeta	I was being sarcastic, I do want that on, but its disabled by default. The Message Notification plugin is I mean.
2010-05-09T08:40:00.000Z	gogeta	UbuntuJeff	strange its on by defult for me
2010-05-09T08:40:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	gogeta	everytime I have installed it through 4 ubuntu versions. always been disabled by default for me.
2010-05-09T08:41:00.000Z	gogeta	UbuntuJeff	i always used the pidgin repos maybe thats why
2010-05-09T08:41:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	gogeta	probably, I use just the ubuntu universal
