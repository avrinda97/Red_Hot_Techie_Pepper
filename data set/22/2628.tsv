2009-04-24T09:42:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor2		How do I copy the Ubuntu img file to my usb drive? I tried dd... and it is EXTREMELY slow... it has been going for 30 minutes now!
2009-04-24T09:42:00.000Z	KingKimi	loquitus_of_bor2	you can use brasero to create the iso
2009-04-24T09:43:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor2	KingKimi	I need to create an iso from the img file? can't I just use unetbootin or something directly?
2009-04-24T09:43:00.000Z	KingKimi	loquitus_of_bor2	what ?? do you want to create the ISo from live cd ??
2009-04-24T09:44:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor2	KingKimi	I want to put the img file onto the usb drive so I can boot off the usb drive on my netbook
2009-04-24T09:44:00.000Z	KingKimi	loquitus_of_bor2	if you have the live cd , you can create the ISo from it ..... and use unetbootin on your pendrive
2009-04-24T09:46:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor2	KingKimi	stupid question but how do I use brasero to convert it from img to iso?
2009-04-24T09:47:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor2	KingKimi	just tried brasero and can't see a straightforward way to do that
2009-04-24T09:47:00.000Z	KingKimi	loquitus_of_bor2	i dont think that you can
2009-04-24T09:47:00.000Z	KingKimi	loquitus_of_bor2	do you have the live cd ? with that you can create the iso and with the created iso , you can use unetbootin
2009-04-24T09:48:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor2	KingKimi	I have the img file for the live cd... so what do I do with the "img" file? do I just use that directly with unetbootin?
2009-04-24T09:48:00.000Z	KingKimi	loquitus_of_bor2	try it yourself :P
2009-04-24T09:48:00.000Z	KingKimi	loquitus_of_bor2	i used unetbootin by creating the iso from the live cd......
2009-04-24T09:49:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor2	KingKimi	I fail to understand how you "created" the ISO from the img file
2009-04-24T09:50:00.000Z	KingKimi	loquitus_of_bor2	i never said "i created the iso from image" ....... but i said  "i created" the iso from "live cd" and then used unetbootin
2009-04-24T09:50:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor2	KingKimi	I don't have a "live" cd.... all I have is the iso file.
2009-04-24T09:51:00.000Z	KingKimi	loquitus_of_bor2	have you googled for "img to iso" ?? ;-)
2009-04-24T09:51:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor2	KingKimi	not yet. I did not realize I needed to convert it till I came here.
2009-04-24T09:51:00.000Z	KingKimi	loquitus_of_bor2	how did you get that img file ? :-O
2009-04-24T09:52:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor2	KingKimi	on the ubuntu.com website?
2009-04-24T09:53:00.000Z	KingKimi	loquitus_of_bor2	i did this for xpud.... i placed the image file in /boot and added lines to /boot/grub/menu.lst  and it will just boot "into" it
2009-04-24T09:54:00.000Z	KingKimi	loquitus_of_bor2	oops ! sorry.. you were telling it for the pendrive
