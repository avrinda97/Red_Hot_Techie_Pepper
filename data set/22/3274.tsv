2008-10-26T02:03:00.000Z	donadon		hello, I'ld like a bit of help with Ubuntu installation
2008-10-26T02:05:00.000Z	Flannel	donadon	Welcome.  The best way to get help is to just ask whatever questions you have.  People will answer whatever they know the answers to.
2008-10-26T02:05:00.000Z	Flannel	donadon	Boot CD?  you mean to install?
2008-10-26T02:05:00.000Z	Flannel	donadon	This is after you hit "Install or run Ubuntu" yes?
2008-10-26T02:06:00.000Z	Flannel	donadon	Have you checked the CD for defects? (few options down)
2008-10-26T02:07:00.000Z	Flannel	donadon	alright, that sounds like a bad burn.  How did you download your iso?
2008-10-26T02:08:00.000Z	Flannel	donadon	Alright, the first section of this page has a few steps that everyone goes through.  Grab your iso and check the MD5, and then re-burn a CD, and try and do it as slow as you can (4x speed is good) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
2008-10-26T02:08:00.000Z	Flannel	donadon	6.06?  Get a newer version, try 8.04
2008-10-26T02:09:00.000Z	Flannel	donadon	The freezes etc have nothing to do with your harddrive.  So before we try and solve some odd harddrive missing issue, lets make sure we have a healthy CD first.
2008-10-26T02:09:00.000Z	Flannel	donadon	so, steps for you to take:  Check the MD5, then re-burn at a slow speed.
2008-10-26T02:10:00.000Z	Flannel	donadon	Nothing saying your ISO is bad.  You can check to see if you need to re-download
2008-10-26T02:10:00.000Z	donadon	Flannel	yes yes, I'll do that!
2008-10-26T02:11:00.000Z	donadon	Flannel	just that I bit bored, I've spent all morning trying to install Debian and I couldnt
2008-10-26T02:13:00.000Z	Flannel	donadon	#ubuntu+1 for Intrepid questions, but yes, I believe so.
2008-10-26T02:19:00.000Z	donadon	Flannel	my shame I cant find the MD5 signature of the media! where is it on the site?
2008-10-26T02:19:00.000Z	Flannel	donadon	These are hardy CDs?
2008-10-26T02:19:00.000Z	Flannel	donadon	http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04.1/ scroll down to the file list, and then check the first few files
2008-10-26T02:20:00.000Z	donadon	Flannel	I downloaded it
2008-10-26T02:25:00.000Z	donadon	Flannel	okay, ISO checked, and my mistake, I dont have the alternative CD, I started the download now...
2008-10-26T02:28:00.000Z	Flannel	donadon	Either one (desktop or alternate) will work.  If the desktop fails, the alternate is more likely to work though.  It's not a liveCD however.
2008-10-26T02:29:00.000Z	donadon	Flannel	I'm checking the CD integrity via the boot menu option in another computer, and the media seems to work. the problem then is with my machine, a laptop where I want to install Ubuntu...
2008-10-26T02:29:00.000Z	Flannel	donadon	Try the alternate CD then.
