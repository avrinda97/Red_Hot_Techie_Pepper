2011-08-30T11:55:00.000Z	jasonmsp		hey all.  I'm looking into options for setting up a softphone and getting a telephone number so when I am out of the country clients can ring me.  What are your thoughts on Dimondcard  and are there other alternatives for setting up a line to my computer?  On the linux side what program is best?  Empathy, Ekiga, Twinkle, etc?
2011-08-30T11:55:00.000Z	norbert79	jasonmsp	Skype?
2011-08-30T11:55:00.000Z	norbert79	jasonmsp	Works well
2011-08-30T11:56:00.000Z	jasonmsp		(other than skype .. ) =_
2011-08-30T11:58:00.000Z	norbert79	jasonmsp	other than skype... Well... Emulation is out of the question, right? (Wine)
2011-08-30T11:58:00.000Z	jasonmsp	norbert79	 well I have virtualbox setup right now with windows xp.  I don't know enough about wine to be comfortable with it at this point.
2011-08-30T11:59:00.000Z	norbert79	jasonmsp	I see...
2011-08-30T11:59:00.000Z	jasonmsp		norbert: (linux is the host, windows is the guest)
2011-08-30T11:59:00.000Z	norbert79	jasonmsp	Hang on
2011-08-30T11:59:00.000Z	jasonmsp	norbert79	 If it is a viable alternative I'm open to it..
2011-08-30T12:00:00.000Z	norbert79		!vopi jasonmsp
2011-08-30T12:00:00.000Z	norbert79		!voip
2011-08-30T12:00:00.000Z	norbert79	jasonmsp	^^
2011-08-30T12:00:00.000Z	norbert79		Never heard of Gizmo5 though
2011-08-30T12:01:00.000Z	jasonmsp	norbert79	  yeah I'm reading the community docs on Ekiga now.
2011-08-30T12:02:00.000Z	jasonmsp	norbert79	 Is dimondcard the only provider or are there others/
2011-08-30T12:02:00.000Z	jasonmsp		?
2011-08-30T12:02:00.000Z	norbert79	jasonmsp	If you need real phone access I guess Gizmo5 would be useful, otherwise I would recommend Mumble for voip transfer.
2011-08-30T12:02:00.000Z	norbert79	jasonmsp	I have no idea unfortunetaly. I only used Skype so far
2011-08-30T12:03:00.000Z	norbert79	jasonmsp	And I assume you live in the US, while I am sitting in EU. So I am not familiar with the providers either.. :(
2011-08-30T12:03:00.000Z	jasonmsp	norbert79	 well techinically I'm, in the middle east at the moment, but I tunnel into our servers in the US.
2011-08-30T12:03:00.000Z	norbert79	jasonmsp	Yet, you might also consider Google's solution too
