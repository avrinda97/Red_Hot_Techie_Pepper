2009-11-27T15:08:00.000Z	kandjar		this is getting really annoying... on my laptop, i had issue with 8.10, after an update the sounds inside firefox went away, 9.04 didnt solve the pb, 9.10 did, and now, after an update, I can only set the volume to max or min, which means either shouting like crazy or no sound at all!!! :(((((
2009-11-27T15:08:00.000Z	kandjar		and here on my desktop, if I play a video with 9.10, few seconds later, the sound goes away... until i readjust the system volume...
2009-11-27T15:09:00.000Z	kandjar		it's retarded! :((((((
2009-11-27T15:09:00.000Z	Younder	kandjar	yes, that would be annoying. what sound card do you have?
2009-11-27T15:10:00.000Z	kandjar	Younder	it's an integrated one; intel i believe
2009-11-27T15:11:00.000Z	Younder	kandjar	do you have the volume control at the top bar?
2009-11-27T15:24:00.000Z	Younder	kandjar	do you use the HDMI port?
2009-11-27T15:13:00.000Z	Younder	kandjar	I have intel inegrated audio too, and it works here
2009-11-27T15:14:00.000Z	Younder	kandjar	I hate net splits..
2009-11-27T15:18:00.000Z	Younder	kandjar	get a soundblaster sound kit then.. It has a external volume control
2009-11-27T15:19:00.000Z	Younder	kandjar	calm down..
2009-11-27T15:19:00.000Z	Younder	kandjar	I am using the same hardware, and it works here
2009-11-27T15:20:00.000Z	Younder	kandjar	so more likely it is a setup problem
2009-11-27T15:22:00.000Z	Younder	kandjar	do you have a HDMI port on the video card?
2009-11-27T15:23:00.000Z	kandjar	Younder	yes
2009-11-27T15:23:00.000Z	Younder	kandjar	that's most likely your problem
2009-11-27T15:24:00.000Z	Younder	kandjar	then disable it

2009-11-27T15:26:00.000Z	kandjar	Younder	i dont think that will help
2009-11-27T15:26:00.000Z	Younder	kandjar	It might, it might not, try
2009-11-27T15:28:00.000Z	Younder	kandjar	that is not exactly integrated intel is it..
