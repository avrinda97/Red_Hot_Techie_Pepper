2011-03-02T12:49:00.000Z	llutz_	gahf	cannot help you with that, i don't use any of those proprietary drivers
2011-03-02T12:50:00.000Z	llutz_	gahf	seems it still uses the old nvidia-driver, try to deinstall it to use the free nouveau driver then. read wiki/forums how to do that (i have no clue about that)
