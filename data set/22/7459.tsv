2006-03-26T07:21:00.000Z	IamEthos		to make sure I actually really WANT Ubuntu
2006-03-26T07:22:00.000Z	IamEthos		so I need some swap for that, I think, don't I?
2006-03-26T07:22:00.000Z	IamEthos		I thought most Linux versions were the same
2006-03-26T07:22:00.000Z	IamEthos		alright
2006-03-26T07:22:00.000Z	IamEthos		fine
2006-03-26T07:22:00.000Z	IamEthos		no swap
2006-03-26T07:23:00.000Z	IamEthos		I'm using it for a personal computer
2006-03-26T07:23:00.000Z	IamEthos		not as a server
2006-03-26T07:23:00.000Z	IamEthos		I'm not taking sides
2006-03-26T07:23:00.000Z	IamEthos		I don't know enough to take sides
2006-03-26T07:24:00.000Z	kingspawn	IamEthos	swap can not hurt,
2006-03-28T14:44:00.000Z	kingspawn	IamEthos	hey, if you like Windows better, why not stick to it?
2006-03-28T14:44:00.000Z	IamEthos	kingspawn	the thing is, I'm not sure which I like better
2006-03-28T14:45:00.000Z	kingspawn	IamEthos	without a doubt, there is a great need for taking a stand against monopolies and software restrictions and patents and the whole shebang
2006-03-28T14:46:00.000Z	IamEthos	kingspawn	i'm very much about that
2006-03-28T14:46:00.000Z	kingspawn	IamEthos	get two systems :)
2006-03-28T14:46:00.000Z	IamEthos	kingspawn	get me a raise :-)
2006-03-28T14:47:00.000Z	kingspawn	IamEthos	done!
2006-03-28T14:50:00.000Z	kingspawn	IamEthos	windows will work, just dont expect it to let your linux partition alone
2006-03-28T14:50:00.000Z	kingspawn	IamEthos	when i dualbooted, windows could like to "check the disks for consitency" at boot. checking for consistency obviously meant correcting the mbr
2006-04-07T07:37:00.000Z	kingspawn	IamEthos	dpkg -i file.deb
2006-04-09T14:52:00.000Z	kingspawn	IamEthos	there is probably some kind of hack available
