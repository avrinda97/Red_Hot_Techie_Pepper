2007-12-25T12:38:00.000Z	Pelo	jangari	ok  when you get to the grub menu,   select the entry for ubuntu , the hit E for edit , select the root line and type E again, change the line to  root (hd0,3)   and hit enter,  then hit B to boot ,  that should boot ubuntu, if it worked, go and edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and make that change permanent, then come back here and we will tell you how to add windows to the grub menu
