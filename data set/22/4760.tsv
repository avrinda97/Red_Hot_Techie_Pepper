2007-11-20T20:01:00.000Z	[Ramy]		hi all, i get this message for my stick  writing operation , "Read only file system " how i can change that ?
2007-11-20T20:01:00.000Z	ikonia	[Ramy]	what file system is on the "stick"
2007-11-20T20:01:00.000Z	[Ramy]	ikonia	Fat32
2007-11-20T20:02:00.000Z	ikonia	[Ramy]	fat32 has no file system permissions so it must be mount permissions remount (man mount) with read/write permissions
2007-11-20T20:15:00.000Z	[Ramy]	ikonia	 sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/flash -rw , i tried this and it does not work  it still read only :(
2007-11-20T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	[Ramy]	the -rw comes before the devices
2007-11-20T20:20:00.000Z	[Ramy]	ikonia	, it does not work till now the same message even i nuatilus under sudo permissions

2007-11-30T16:32:00.000Z	ikonia	[Ramy]	thats not advisable
2007-11-30T16:32:00.000Z	[Ramy]	ikonia	, but i don't want to loose the stability of FF 2 and the speed of 3 ?
2007-11-30T16:34:00.000Z	[Ramy]	ikonia	 but in FF 3 alpha8 is in ubuntu repository what about FF 3 beta 1 ?
2007-11-30T16:34:00.000Z	ikonia	[Ramy]	what about it ?
2007-11-30T16:34:00.000Z	[Ramy]	ikonia	, FF 3 alpha 8 does not conflict !!! , does the beta version will be in the repository ?
2007-11-30T16:35:00.000Z	ikonia	[Ramy]	what do you mean, does not conflict ?
2007-11-30T16:35:00.000Z	[Ramy]	ikonia	, they don't conflict
2007-11-30T16:36:00.000Z	ikonia	[Ramy]	do what you want. the bottom line is the package replaces the old one
2007-11-30T16:37:00.000Z	[Ramy]	ikonia	, i want to run them simultaneously  :)
