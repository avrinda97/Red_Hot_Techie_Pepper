2011-12-29T11:37:00.000Z	bikcmp		hi all, i'm using an hp mini 110, and all of a sudden, my trackpad buttons actually don't do anything anymore.
2011-12-29T11:37:00.000Z	bikcmp		i'm praying this is software side.
2011-12-29T11:37:00.000Z	bikcmp		i'm on here from my hp mini; i managed to connect using just my keyboard.
2011-12-29T11:37:00.000Z	bikcmp		is there a known setting that disables the touhpad click?
2011-12-29T11:38:00.000Z	bikcmp		or, a way to check the mouse settings using the keyboard only?
2011-12-29T11:38:00.000Z	DrPenguin	bikcmp	dmesg may tell you if its shut off
2011-12-29T11:38:00.000Z	bikcmp	DrPenguin	my right button works fine
2011-12-29T11:40:00.000Z	bikcmp	DrPenguin	the thing making me think it's not hw is the fact that double tapping my actual trackpad used to make it click.
2011-12-29T11:41:00.000Z	DrPenguin	bikcmp	your computer is just dumb then
2011-12-29T11:41:00.000Z	bikcmp	DrPenguin	ikr
2011-12-29T11:41:00.000Z	bikcmp	DrPenguin	i'm saving up for another one.
2011-12-29T11:42:00.000Z	bikcmp	DrPenguin	i have no normal desktop/laptop, too
2011-12-29T11:45:00.000Z	bikcmp	DrPenguin	i think i know what it is. :(
2011-12-29T11:45:00.000Z	bikcmp	DrPenguin	i think my left button is getting stuck down.
2011-12-29T11:45:00.000Z	DrPenguin	bikcmp	well you know what to do then right?
2011-12-29T11:45:00.000Z	bikcmp	DrPenguin	but it's so fun
2011-12-29T11:46:00.000Z	bikcmp	DrPenguin	in all seriousness though... i don't know much about hw repair. i'm a software guy.
2011-12-29T11:46:00.000Z	DrPenguin	bikcmp	see if its easy to open the thing up, if your lucky, its probably just something you spilled on it and some isophrophic alcohol, highest proof you can get, will fix it
2011-12-29T11:47:00.000Z	bikcmp	DrPenguin	it's broken, actually
2011-12-29T11:48:00.000Z	bikcmp	DrPenguin	i've got proof it does actually conduct.
2011-12-29T11:48:00.000Z	bikcmp	DrPenguin	WANT TO SEE?
2011-12-29T11:48:00.000Z	DrPenguin	bikcmp	X Event Viewer, it records ALL X events and spits em into your terminal
