2012-11-29T07:32:00.000Z	hatsaresilly		I could use some help with compiz, is this the right place to ask?
2012-11-29T07:33:00.000Z	hatsaresilly		It's a radeon
2012-11-29T07:34:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	how about the obvious question, what about compiz is the issue?
2012-11-29T07:38:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	sounds like you clobbered the compiz settings, compiz is a user app or system? lets assume user, delete your compiz config folder within user space
2012-11-29T07:43:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	i run KDE, i dont have compiz
2012-11-29T07:44:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	no, your /home/somename/
2012-11-29T07:45:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	/.config?
2012-11-29T07:46:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	sub /compiz or /.compiz is a good place to look
2012-11-29T07:49:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	so go the next step, purge compiz and re-install?
2012-11-29T07:50:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	do you need compiz?
2012-11-29T07:50:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	ah
2012-11-29T07:51:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	unless you need glitz on the desktop you dont need it
2012-11-29T07:51:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	if you dont have it, vnc may not act up\
2012-11-29T07:52:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	i opt for the lesser headless, ssh with x, works for me
2012-11-29T08:05:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	the settings are within your userspace then, a purge would have wiped the system settings
2012-11-29T08:07:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	the settings are within your userspace then, a purge would have wiped the system settings, you said that your 'mirror' is 'sg.archive......' , change it to 'us.archive......'
2012-11-29T08:07:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	the settings are within your userspace then, a purge would have wiped the system settings, you said that your 'mirror' is 'sg.archive......' , change it to 'us.archive......' <-- oops
2012-11-29T08:08:00.000Z	hatsaresilly	almoxarife	is broken
2012-11-29T08:13:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	un-install compiz completely, via purge, run it without compiz, does issue disappear?
2012-11-29T08:15:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	its not compiz then
2012-11-29T08:16:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	it only happens via vnc connection?
2012-11-29T08:17:00.000Z	almoxarife	hatsaresilly	look at the log /var/log/Xorg.0.log and syslog while at it
