2007-03-06T08:46:00.000Z	dRk_sHd0w		hey guys when i am running ubuntu server and my spt-get is broke i tried replacing the sources.list but got the same error
2007-03-06T08:47:00.000Z	Flannel	dRk_sHd0w	"broke"?  What does broke consist of?
2007-03-06T08:47:00.000Z	dRk_sHd0w	Flannel	it doesnt work it says the dependencies are missing
2007-03-06T08:47:00.000Z	Flannel	dRk_sHd0w	what are you installing?
2007-03-06T08:49:00.000Z	Flannel	dRk_sHd0w	and which packages have unmet dependencies?
2007-03-06T08:50:00.000Z	dRk_sHd0w	Flannel	any of them including apt-get update :(
2007-03-06T08:50:00.000Z	Flannel	dRk_sHd0w	That last sentence doesn't make any sense, honestly.  So, what you're saying is any package you try and install has unmet dependencies?  Arlight.  Pastebin your sources.list
2007-03-06T08:51:00.000Z	dRk_sHd0w	Flannel	whats the pastebin url
2007-03-06T08:55:00.000Z	dRk_sHd0w	Flannel	here is my sources.list http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8876
2007-03-06T08:56:00.000Z	Flannel	dRk_sHd0w	hmm.  all looks in order there.  `sudo apt-get update` doesn't fix the issue?  do you get any errrs doing that?
2007-03-06T08:59:00.000Z	dRk_sHd0w	Flannel	I get an error when i apt-get update heres the error i get http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8879
2007-03-06T09:00:00.000Z	Flannel	dRk_sHd0w	you need to use sudo.  `sudo apt-get update`
2007-03-06T09:00:00.000Z	dRk_sHd0w	Flannel	I got the same error
2007-03-06T09:01:00.000Z	Flannel	dRk_sHd0w	Looks like you're having network problems.  Change your mirror.
2007-03-06T09:08:00.000Z	dRk_sHd0w	Flannel	I have this file called sources.list.lock and it has a number on it could that have something to do with it?
2007-03-06T09:11:00.000Z	dRk_sHd0w	Flannel	I ahv a file called sources.list.lock with a number on it could that be the problem it's in the same dir as sources.list?
2007-03-06T09:12:00.000Z	Flannel	dRk_sHd0w	ARe you editing your sources.list soemwhere?  Maybe the software properties dialog or whatnot?
2007-03-06T09:13:00.000Z	dRk_sHd0w	Flannel	it was when i made the list
2007-03-06T09:14:00.000Z	Flannel	dRk_sHd0w	did you exit out of it?
2007-03-06T09:14:00.000Z	dRk_sHd0w	Flannel	yes
2007-03-06T09:37:00.000Z	dRk_sHd0w	Flannel	would editing my /ect/hosts file ahve to do with why apt-get isn't working?
2007-03-06T10:06:00.000Z	Flannel	dRk_sHd0w	No.  Uness you made that (de.archive.ubuntu.com) URL not work.  Just change your mirror, it should work.  (remove the de, juts archive.ubuntu.com), or find one that you can ping regularly
