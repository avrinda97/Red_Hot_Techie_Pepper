2007-05-10T14:33:00.000Z	RPDrake		is it just me or are the Ekiga Softphone quite lousy?
2007-05-10T14:34:00.000Z	dimebar	RPDrake	I don't have any probs with ekiga
2007-05-10T14:34:00.000Z	RPDrake	dimebar	with the default settings?
2007-05-10T14:35:00.000Z	dimebar		Only problem I had was when the default stun server didn't work; I had to change it to a different one
2007-05-10T14:36:00.000Z	dimebar	RPDrake	what is the problem you're having with it?
2007-05-10T14:36:00.000Z	RPDrake	dimebar	you can use ip addresses too right?
2007-05-10T14:36:00.000Z	RPDrake	dimebar	the sound is quite noisy
2007-05-10T14:36:00.000Z	dimebar	RPDrake	Do you use a headset?
2007-05-10T14:36:00.000Z	RPDrake	dimebar	and delayed
2007-05-10T14:37:00.000Z	RPDrake	dimebar	I use the build in mic on my laptop
2007-05-10T14:38:00.000Z	dimebar	RPDrake	Do you use other VOIP software in that way?
2007-05-10T14:38:00.000Z	RPDrake	dimebar	with IP instead of Ekiga style address?
2007-05-10T14:39:00.000Z	RPDrake		yo rezzie
2007-05-10T14:40:00.000Z	RPDrake		you too
2007-05-10T14:40:00.000Z	RPDrake		haha
2007-05-10T14:41:00.000Z	RPDrake		a+w ;)
2007-05-10T14:41:00.000Z	dimebar	RPDrake	I think you're using H232 rather than SIP - SIP in my opinion works far better.  http://wiki.ekiga.org/index.php/What_is_SIP%3F
2007-05-10T14:42:00.000Z	RPDrake		thnx dimebar I'll check it
2007-05-10T14:43:00.000Z	dimebar	RPDrake	If it doesn't sound any better may want to give Gizmo a go
2007-05-10T14:43:00.000Z	RPDrake	dimebar	seems like the SIP is just like a DNS
2007-05-10T14:44:00.000Z	RPDrake		no lil a tho'
2007-05-10T14:46:00.000Z	dimebar	RPDrake	similar idea, yes
