2007-05-06T07:13:00.000Z	soothsay	anAnonymousKille	Are you sure your username is correct? Try 'whoami' at the terminal to check

2007-05-06T07:16:00.000Z	soothsay	anAnonymousKille	Not really. I'm seeing if I can find anything on launchpad. Seems strange.
2007-05-06T07:17:00.000Z	anAnonymousKille		yeah... and thanks for looking... is there anyplace i can look also?
2007-05-06T07:17:00.000Z	soothsay	anAnonymousKille	Launchpad.net is the repository for bug reports. Searching ubuntu forums can be useful also.
2007-05-06T07:18:00.000Z	soothsay	anAnonymousKille	Do you click in the text box first?
2007-05-06T07:18:00.000Z	soothsay	anAnonymousKille	i.e. Make it active
2007-05-06T07:19:00.000Z	anAnonymousKille	soothsay	 in the older version i didnt have to click on the box... typing went staigh in
2007-05-06T07:20:00.000Z	soothsay	anAnonymousKille	If you click the box now you don't have the problem?
