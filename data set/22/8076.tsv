2006-06-15T11:15:00.000Z	axisys		how do I access to a windows network drive?
2006-06-15T11:16:00.000Z	rambo	axisys	mount -t smbfs -u username=name,password=pass \\my\great\windows\share mydir/
2006-06-15T11:16:00.000Z	axisys	rambo	cool let me try that
2006-06-15T12:03:00.000Z	axisys	rambo	i get this
2006-06-15T12:03:00.000Z	axisys	rambo	i get this mount: unknown filesystem type 'smbs'
2006-06-15T12:03:00.000Z	rambo	axisys	should be smbfs not smbs
2006-06-15T12:07:00.000Z	axisys	rambo	i get this now http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/aUNa2623.html
2006-06-15T12:08:00.000Z	rambo	axisys	hmm...
2006-06-15T12:08:00.000Z	rambo	axisys	make sure you have done a sudo apt-get install samba
2006-06-15T12:10:00.000Z	axisys	rambo	installing it now
2006-06-15T12:10:00.000Z	rambo	axisys	probably a good idea :)
2006-06-15T12:11:00.000Z	axisys	rambo	it also started the samba daemon.. i do not think i need that to connect to windows server.. correct?
2006-06-15T12:11:00.000Z	rambo	axisys	probably not
2006-06-15T12:11:00.000Z	axisys	rambo	still same error
2006-06-15T12:12:00.000Z	axisys	rambo	let me check wiki and i may bug u again
2006-06-15T12:13:00.000Z	rambo	axisys	good idea... also, try doing the same command but with all of the \ slashes turned into / slashes
2006-06-15T12:13:00.000Z	axisys	rambo	guess what i did not have smbfs installed.. duh !
2006-06-15T12:14:00.000Z	rambo	axisys	oh haha i assumed apt-get install samba would cover that
2006-06-15T12:17:00.000Z	axisys	rambo	i am in.. i had to do this -o username=xxxx,workgroup=activedirname and it prompts for password
2006-06-15T12:17:00.000Z	axisys	rambo	would be nice if i could do it as a user and not root
2006-06-15T12:19:00.000Z	rambo	axisys	there's a way to let non-root users mount drives... lemme look it up
2006-06-15T12:25:00.000Z	rambo	axisys	ok you're going to need to open up your /etc/group file(make a backup first) and add your username to the line disk. should look something like disk:x:6:root,yourusername
