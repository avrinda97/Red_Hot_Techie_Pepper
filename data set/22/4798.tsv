2007-10-08T16:47:00.000Z	LiMaO		could anyone do me a favor? i need to know if a site is having problems with the java applet or if it's just me. https://www2.bancobrasil.com.br/aapf/login.jsp?aapf.IDH=sim  --> does the java applet load and show some numbers??
2007-10-08T16:49:00.000Z	LiMaO		people don't understand our questions =/
2007-10-08T16:49:00.000Z	LiMaO		sorry
2007-10-08T16:49:00.000Z	LiMaO		just want to make sure someone else can load that site, before i start tracking down the problem source
2007-10-08T16:50:00.000Z	LiMaO		flash does have sound
2007-10-08T15:41:00.000Z	LiMaO		is there an easy way to install flash on feisty 64bit? i mean, under gutsy, it's available automatically, offered by the plugin manager.. what about feisty?
2007-10-08T15:42:00.000Z	astro76	LiMaO	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AMD64/FirefoxAndPlugins
2007-10-08T15:44:00.000Z	astro76	LiMaO	eh... you could just wait 10 days for gutsy
2007-10-08T15:46:00.000Z	LiMaO	astro76	i've tried it already. i gave up on gutsy this afternoon, after not being able to use openoffice, having to kill nautilus some few times because it was frozen. and even on gutsy, i couldn't get java to work at all
2007-10-08T15:46:00.000Z	astro76	LiMaO	I said wait 10 days for the release
2007-10-08T15:46:00.000Z	astro76	LiMaO	lots of bug fixes yet to go in
2007-10-08T15:46:00.000Z	LiMaO	astro76	oh sorry, it probably will be more stable by then, but i really doubt java will be functional.. and i need it for my homebanking access
2007-10-08T15:47:00.000Z	astro76	LiMaO	why wouldn't it be? is it a bug, and if so have you reported it if it hasn't been already?
2007-10-08T15:48:00.000Z	LiMaO	astro76	i'm using virtualbox, with an xp install just to access my bank.. that's ridiculous.. after 4 years without windows, i have to use it again
2007-10-08T15:48:00.000Z	LiMaO	astro76	i didn't have problems with java when i was using 32bit feisty.. the problem is with 64bit
2007-10-08T15:49:00.000Z	astro76	LiMaO	so I have to ask, do you have a real reason to run 64-bit?
2007-10-08T15:49:00.000Z	LiMaO	astro76	3d rendering... or else i would be using 32bit, not much of a difference at all
2007-10-09T16:16:00.000Z	LiMaO	astro76	and jrib, LOVE YA BOTH =P got java + flash working. and finally i know what was done to the system.. didn't have to run any obscure script to get it done
2007-10-24T09:58:00.000Z	astro76	LiMaO	system wide or just your user? what directory may I ask?
2007-10-24T09:59:00.000Z	LiMaO	astro76	system wide. /opt/kde3/bin
2007-10-24T09:59:00.000Z	astro76	LiMaO	you can do what nickrud said but in /etc/profile for all users
2007-10-24T09:59:00.000Z	LiMaO	astro76	alright, better yet =)
