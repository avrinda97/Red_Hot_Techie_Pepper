2012-01-15T23:38:00.000Z	napperjabber_		So, I'm looking to getting into developing ontop of ubuntu, where do I start?
2012-01-15T23:40:00.000Z	jayson_r	napperjabber_	what language?
2012-01-15T23:40:00.000Z	napperjabber_	jayson_r	thinking c, c++, but i'm fluent in python
2012-01-15T23:41:00.000Z	jayson_r		for c and c++ 'apt-get install build-essential' would get you the basics installed
2012-01-15T23:42:00.000Z	jayson_r	napperjabber_	outside of that, google is your friend - there is a lot of stuff on blogs out there for specific languages/environments
2012-01-15T23:42:00.000Z	napperjabber_	jayson_r	thank you sir
2012-01-15T23:43:00.000Z	jayson_r	napperjabber_	glad to help - hope that gets you started at least :-)
2012-01-15T23:43:00.000Z	napperjabber_	jayson_r	when it's installed, where are the help docs stored? /usr/share?
2012-01-15T23:44:00.000Z	jayson_r	napperjabber_	ha, not really sure - never went looking for them :-/
2012-01-15T23:45:00.000Z	napperjabber_	jayson_r	haha, I guess I should do a linux from scratch build then :P
2012-01-15T23:45:00.000Z	napperjabber_		but yeah, the package list is in /usr/share/build-essential
2012-01-15T23:45:00.000Z	jayson_r	napperjabber_	i wouldn't go that far, unless you really want to. if development is your goal, Ubuntu is as good as any distro  (or LFS for that matter)
2012-01-15T23:46:00.000Z	jayson_r	napperjabber_	most of my dev stuff on Ubuntu is hacking on Ruby on Rails
2012-01-15T23:46:00.000Z	jayson_r	napperjabber_	i'm also a C#/F# dev, so I spent most of my time developing on a Win7 box actually
2012-01-15T23:47:00.000Z	napperjabber_	jayson_r	ah, noted, I'm a web dude originally, but now I'm starting to think about how to build standalone software that I can decouple from my apps
2012-01-15T23:50:00.000Z	napperjabber_	jayson_r	I kind of need to get down and dirty with the inner os workings, it's getting to a point weher I just want to have socket connections and only user http to server up pages rather thene raw data. with the advent of gevent, I've wondered how hard it is to make my own app in c/c++ that implments the http protocol on my own. It's more of an educational exorcise. I just picked up the book on unix sockets to get me started
2012-01-15T23:51:00.000Z	napperjabber_	jayson_r	thanks again for the direction!
2012-01-15T23:52:00.000Z	jayson_r	napperjabber_	np - if you want to learn more about the inner workings of linux, take a look at Arch Linux
2012-01-15T23:52:00.000Z	jayson_r	napperjabber_	easier than LFS, but will still teach you TONS
2012-01-15T23:54:00.000Z	napperjabber_	jayson_r	interesting
2012-01-15T23:54:00.000Z	jayson_r	napperjabber_	ok man - gotta run for now, but good luck with your project!
2012-01-15T23:55:00.000Z	napperjabber_	jayson_r	peace, thanks again!
