2009-11-28T20:09:00.000Z	oCean_	thevishy	be sure to checksum your download before burning: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes
2009-12-05T15:45:00.000Z	oCean_	thevishy	what?
2009-12-05T15:46:00.000Z	oCean_	thevishy	then read the link the bot gave you
2009-12-05T17:59:00.000Z	oCean_	thevishy	i'd say check out ebox. (http://www.ebox-platform.com/)
2009-12-05T17:59:00.000Z	thevishy	oCean_	in synaptics can I install ebox
2009-12-05T18:01:00.000Z	oCean_	thevishy	actually apt != rpm, apt is more like yum, while dpkg is more or less like rpm :)
2009-12-05T18:03:00.000Z	thevishy	oCean_	to install ebox can I use synpatic
2009-12-05T18:04:00.000Z	oCean_	thevishy	so, give it a try
2009-12-05T18:05:00.000Z	thevishy	oCean_	i am checking in synaptic but what I see ebox package which install libraries needed for ebox softwares like netowkr manager etc
2009-12-05T18:14:00.000Z	thevishy	oCean_	what about downloading the deb and trying it directly ?
2009-12-05T18:15:00.000Z	oCean_	thevishy	webmin is no longer supported. To install ebox, add ppa to your sources.list. See here: http://trac.ebox-platform.com/wiki/Document/Documentation/InstallationGuide
2009-12-05T18:17:00.000Z	oCean_	thevishy	however, that seems for hardy, guess there should be similar ppa for other distro's. PPA means personal package archive
2009-12-12T17:26:00.000Z	oCean_	thevishy	check launchpad?
