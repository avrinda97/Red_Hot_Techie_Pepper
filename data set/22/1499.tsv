2010-05-03T04:30:00.000Z	jbuncher	Loshki	I'm on a somewhat unconventional setup though, grub 1 from hardy on mbr chainloads grub 1 leftover from karmic installed on sda6, which then loads lucid on sda6.
2010-05-03T04:31:00.000Z	Loshki	jbuncher	why not just boot lucid direct from grub1 from hardy?
2010-05-03T04:31:00.000Z	jbuncher	Loshki	somewhat long story, but at this point I think it just won't boot if I point it directly at the kernels from the hardy grub 1, since grub1 in installed on the partition.
2010-05-03T04:32:00.000Z	Loshki	jbuncher	Um, hardy grub1 won't understand ext4 on lucid. I forgot to mention that I run lucid on ext3...
2010-05-03T04:33:00.000Z	jbuncher	Loshki	same here.  This lucid is a karmic upgrade which was an upgrade from jaunty, picked ext3.
2010-05-03T04:34:00.000Z	Loshki	jbuncher	well, no point fixing it if it isn't broken, but it should be directly bootable from grub...
2010-05-03T04:34:00.000Z	jbuncher	Loshki	I'll give it another shot.
2010-05-03T04:34:00.000Z	jbuncher	Loshki	brb.
2010-05-03T04:35:00.000Z	Loshki	jbuncher	kk
2010-05-03T04:50:00.000Z	jbuncher	Loshki	almost worked, I think I don't have the syntax quite right. would you mind pastebin-ing your lines that boot your lucid install?
2010-05-03T04:51:00.000Z	Loshki	jbuncher	may I pm it to you?
2010-05-03T04:51:00.000Z	jbuncher	Loshki	sure
2010-05-03T11:53:00.000Z	jbuncher	Loshki	I found a workaround to the Plymouth bug I mentioned earlier :  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/plymouth/+bug/540801/comments/29  .  It supposedly slows down the boot though.  The underlying problem is that hte graphics drivers take longer to load that it takes to check and mount hte filesystem, so there's no reason to load the splash as we can already load X.
2010-05-03T11:54:00.000Z	Loshki	jbuncher	Wow, good detective work!
2010-05-03T11:55:00.000Z	jbuncher	Loshki	I just finally was able to google the right few words and find it in launchpad.  I've even searched in launchpad directly before and haven't found that, so I dunno.  Got lucky this time.
2010-05-03T11:55:00.000Z	Loshki	jbuncher	there's an art to making google cough up the right stuff...
2010-05-03T11:56:00.000Z	jbuncher	Loshki	definitely.  You mentioned you were a hardy user earlier (or at least, you have a Hardy install).  Have you run into a bug streaming from last.fm from within rhythymbox?
2010-05-03T11:57:00.000Z	Loshki	jbuncher	I switched to 10.04 a couple of days ago, sorry. I don't run rhythmbox or use last.fm. Maybe someone else knows?
2010-05-03T11:58:00.000Z	jbuncher	Loshki	thx anyway.  I haven't found anyone that knows, most of the bugs are for versions either before or after hardy, all of which seem to have had the bug fixed!
2010-05-03T12:10:00.000Z	jbuncher	Loshki	I'm off, thanks again for all of your help earlier.  I was indeed getting the root= option in the kernel line wrong.
2010-05-03T12:10:00.000Z	Loshki	jbuncher	glad it got sorted...
2010-05-03T12:14:00.000Z	Loshki	jbuncher	Jon_: I know, sickening isn't it...
