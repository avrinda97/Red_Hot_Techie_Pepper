2012-11-04T15:04:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	 gimp also takes screenshots  but hold on
2012-11-04T15:04:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	  mtpaint takes screenshots for one
2012-11-04T15:05:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	  here is a link to read   http://www.lubuntutips.com/2011/12/lubuntu-screenshots.html#.UJY9yXZhNTM
2012-11-04T15:07:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	 I have seen mtpaint mentioned a few times for lubuntu screenshots
2012-11-04T15:08:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	 I am installing it now to test
2012-11-04T15:15:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	that was for you
2012-11-04T15:16:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	  mm,, I know compiz has a cool screenshot tool ,, drag over the area to be captured,, and gimp,, also,, gimp 2.8 but you need a PPA  for that
2012-11-04T15:17:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	  I think under File --> Create --> Screenshot,, but let me check gimp 2.8 here hold on
2012-11-04T15:18:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	  it works fine in gimp,, and fast  and it opens immediately in gimp for edition
2012-11-04T15:18:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	  editing rather
2012-11-04T15:19:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	 out of curiosity,  in terminal    type   compiz  --version
2012-11-04T15:20:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	 ah ok
2012-11-04T15:22:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	 for screen shots?  no  unless it can install a windows screenshot tool which i wouldnt recommend
2012-11-04T15:26:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	 you can reinstall lubuntu-desktop    .. did you use  sudo apt-get remove scrot  ?
2012-11-04T15:27:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	 ok
2012-11-04T15:27:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	 scrot is default install//yes?
2012-11-04T15:28:00.000Z	coz_	marcus	 out of curiosity,  why Lubuntu?
