2005-08-27T07:08:00.000Z	ttj		I'm having trouble installing ubuntu... I need an installer with a kernel that includes the ahci module. For some reason, it's not included either in hoary or breezy, but the driver seems to be included in the standard kernels in apt. This is just too weird :/
2005-08-27T07:09:00.000Z	bob2	ttj	it's part of the hoary kernel
2005-08-27T07:09:00.000Z	ttj	bob2	well, no.
2005-08-27T07:09:00.000Z	bob2	ttj	well, it is
2005-08-27T07:09:00.000Z	ttj	bob2	how come I can't find it then? I've tried using both the CD and netinstall
2005-08-27T07:09:00.000Z	bob2	ttj	perhaps it's not part of the installation kernel
2005-08-27T07:09:00.000Z	ttj	bob2	exactly
2005-08-27T07:10:00.000Z	bob2	ttj	you looked from a vt during the install?
2005-08-27T07:10:00.000Z	ttj	bob2	yep
2005-08-27T07:11:00.000Z	ttj	bob2	it's still not there, heh
2005-08-27T07:14:00.000Z	ttj	bob2	any suggestions on how to solve this?
2005-08-27T07:20:00.000Z	ttj	bob2	no tips then I gather? well, thanks anyway :-)
2005-08-27T07:21:00.000Z	bob2	ttj	no, sorry; you could copy it from an installed machgine, tho
2005-08-27T07:22:00.000Z	ttj	bob2	hmm... during install or do you mean copy ahci.ko and insmod it?
2005-08-27T07:22:00.000Z	bob2	ttj	modprobe it during install, yeah
2005-08-27T07:22:00.000Z	ttj	bob2	yeah, but I mean, where would I get it from? is there a way to copy stuff from another machine in a vt during install?
2005-08-27T07:23:00.000Z	bob2	ttj	the installer has wget
2005-08-27T07:23:00.000Z	ttj	bob2	oh, nice
2005-08-27T07:23:00.000Z	ttj	bob2	I'll try that, thanks
2005-08-27T07:23:00.000Z	bob2	ttj	well, a crippled busybox wget, but it'l be enough
2005-08-27T07:31:00.000Z	ttj	bob2	I'm getting "invalid module format" when trying to insmod the module, any tips?
2005-08-27T07:40:00.000Z	ttj	bob2	can I download the ahci.ko module from the standard ubuntu kernel from somewhere?
