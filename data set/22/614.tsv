2011-09-12T06:48:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		why do you want 777 though as thats insecure for script injections
2011-09-12T06:48:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		chmod 755 is a ll you need whats the error again?
2011-09-12T06:49:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		thats your directory permissions its denied because theres no default index
2011-09-12T06:50:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		easiest way make an index.html that meta refreshes to the zip
2011-09-12T06:51:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		otherwise allow directory listing in apache (insecurish)
2011-09-12T06:51:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		no its a user issue
2011-09-12T06:52:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		they do where there being served by apache
2011-09-12T06:52:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		your setting dirs that shouldnt be
2011-09-12T06:52:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		sorry your not experienced enough for me to give you any more advice
2011-09-12T06:53:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		gumby by user i meant the admin
2011-09-12T06:54:00.000Z	Gumby	L1nuxRules	then don't help if you are just going to degrade a person for their lack of knowledge.  Educate
2011-09-12T06:54:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	Gumby	I have tried
2011-09-12T06:56:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	Gumby	this is also advising how to do things and making a web server insecure
2011-09-12T06:59:00.000Z	Gumby	L1nuxRules	why?
2011-09-12T07:04:00.000Z	Gumby	L1nuxRules	if www-data has read permissions then its access would not be denied
2011-09-12T07:08:00.000Z	Gumby	L1nuxRules	good for you
2011-09-12T07:10:00.000Z	Gumby	L1nuxRules	how is adding a user to a group that would normally have read access to a web site anyhow being insecure?
2011-09-12T07:10:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	Gumby	its not but the way he has been going about it is
2011-09-12T07:11:00.000Z	Gumby	L1nuxRules	then why are you telling people to not advise him of doing insecure stuff when nobody has
2011-09-12T07:11:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	Gumby	how long have you been reading what hes been asking?
2011-09-12T07:58:00.000Z	Gumby	L1nuxRules	the apache user does make a difference though for the second half of the problem.  This being that apache needs to be able to read the files since those files are being served via httpd
2011-09-12T07:59:00.000Z	Gumby	L1nuxRules	vsftpd should be scrapped :)
