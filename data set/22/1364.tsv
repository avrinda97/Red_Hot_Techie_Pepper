2010-08-02T19:03:00.000Z	gryllida		how do I unzip in bash?
2010-08-02T19:03:00.000Z	gryllida		I don't have apt-get access
2010-08-02T19:04:00.000Z	Pici	gryllida	unzip file.zip
2010-08-13T19:33:00.000Z	Pici	gryllida	You could run alacarte to customize your menus.
2010-08-13T19:33:00.000Z	gryllida	Pici	well, okay, and how do I uninstall xfce?
2010-08-13T19:34:00.000Z	Pici	gryllida	How did you install it?
2010-08-13T19:34:00.000Z	gryllida	Pici	I think it was sudo apt-get install xfce
2010-08-13T19:35:00.000Z	Pici	gryllida	sudo apt-get remove xfce4
2010-08-13T19:36:00.000Z	gryllida	Pici	"Package xfce4 is not installed, so not removed
2010-08-13T19:39:00.000Z	Pici	gryllida	Well, You can remoev xfwm4, that should prompt to remove a bunch of other stuff that depends on it as well.
2010-08-13T19:40:00.000Z	gryllida	Pici	Maybe. But currently it does not remove anything. It ouputs "Package xfce4 is not installed, so not removed".
2010-08-13T19:41:00.000Z	gryllida	Pici	With 2 Terminals in Accessories menu.
2010-08-13T19:41:00.000Z	Pici	gryllida	My second command said xfwm4, not xfce4
2010-08-13T19:42:00.000Z	gryllida	Pici	Oh, I see. Doing it now.
2010-08-13T19:43:00.000Z	gryllida	Pici	I removed xfwm4 but the additional Terminal in the menu is still there. It is called "Terminal Emulator" and looks differently. How can I get a list of what I installed today?
2010-08-13T19:44:00.000Z	Pici	gryllida	Take a look at /var/log/dpkg.log
2010-08-13T19:47:00.000Z	gryllida	Pici	Okay. How do I uninstall xfce?
2010-08-13T19:49:00.000Z	Pici	gryllida	remove xubuntu-desktop
2010-08-13T19:51:00.000Z	gryllida	Pici	I removed xfwm4 and xubuntu-desktop. Still two "Terminal" menuitems there.
2010-08-13T19:51:00.000Z	Pici	gryllida	You can try removing xfce4-terminal
2010-08-13T19:53:00.000Z	gryllida	Pici	Great, it is gone. Now I see that it really is the xfce installation result, not anything else. But now I'm looking at two "Dictionaries" in "Office" menu and wondering whether there is a better nonmanual way to remove it all.
2010-08-13T19:53:00.000Z	Pici	gryllida	You can try: sudo apt-get autoremove, but that may prompt to remove more things than you'd like
