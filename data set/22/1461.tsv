2010-06-02T22:47:00.000Z	pgpkeys	tripelb	~ no that is not true
2010-06-02T22:48:00.000Z	tripelb	pgpkeys	hi. I have it or I dont?  (I just looked up - what is compiz. Totally curiosity. I dont know if I have a need to know but I have heard the term in here.)
2010-06-02T22:48:00.000Z	pgpkeys		dpkg -l | grep compiz (look for ii in the very first column)
2010-06-02T22:49:00.000Z	pgpkeys		and apt-cache search compiz and see what the small description says (I am using grep there because I don't know if its compiz-bin or some other package name and that will grab ANY compiz related package that is installed and display its status
2010-06-02T22:49:00.000Z	pgpkeys		)
2010-06-02T22:51:00.000Z	pgpkeys		what happens if you modify your grub.cfg to remove the splash and reboot a few times. see where it's hanging
2010-06-02T22:51:00.000Z	pgpkeys		rerun grub-install /dev/yourdev (whatever your device is)

2010-06-02T22:53:00.000Z	tripelb		the old X in the "taskbar" for XCHAT was easy to distinguish and choose. Now there's some vague nubbin. Can I get the X back?
2010-06-02T22:53:00.000Z	pgpkeys		promethes ~ nothing in dmesg or /var/log/lastlog ?
2010-06-02T22:54:00.000Z	pgpkeys		dmesg | less  && tail -n 300 -f /var/log/lastlog
2010-06-02T22:54:00.000Z	pgpkeys		9so when you hit enter at the last line of the dmesgt output it automatically will launch looking at the lastlog
2010-06-02T22:54:00.000Z	pgpkeys		)
2010-06-02T22:54:00.000Z	pgpkeys		yeah I can SO not type today
2010-06-02T22:55:00.000Z	tripelb	pgpkeys	I see the ii in several lines. Now I'm playing with something I read in technomania and it's loading drivers. I put some chinese video card that someone gave me in - and it seems like it is an Nvidia card. At present, trying to load the driver/s.
2010-06-02T22:55:00.000Z	pgpkeys	tripelb	~ got ya. I use ATI (almost as bad) so can't help with the nvidia but it should be pretty much loading the related nvidia driver from non-free if its a newer card
2010-06-02T22:56:00.000Z	tripelb		I do declare, 10.04 took 10 minutes to get going from the liveCD. Is this normal? (Dell 4600)
2010-06-02T22:56:00.000Z	tripelb		How do I make some chars bold in here? This 10.04 xchat doesnt do it with control-B
2010-06-02T22:56:00.000Z	pgpkeys		errr don't do bold.
2010-06-02T22:56:00.000Z	pgpkeys		that's nasty
2010-06-02T22:57:00.000Z	tripelb	pgpkeys	ok I wont do it in here. jrib - will it work in another server?
