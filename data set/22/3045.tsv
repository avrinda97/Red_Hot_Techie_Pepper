2008-12-23T06:23:00.000Z	Mitsenear		I just installed Ubuntu 8.10 from the Mini.iso file (network install) and everything seemed to install fine; however, now that I've reached the login page, my monitor only displays that I need to set my screen res. to 1680 x 1050 @60Hz or lower. What do I do to lower my res. w/out a GUI?
2008-12-23T06:23:00.000Z	Zelda	Mitsenear	join the group. Im having the same issues and noone knows anything.
2008-12-23T06:23:00.000Z	Zelda		I tried to ask yesterday and noone helped.
2008-12-23T06:24:00.000Z	Mitsenear		Hm.
2008-12-23T06:24:00.000Z	Zelda		something is wrong with xserver.
2008-12-23T06:24:00.000Z	Zelda		have you tried to reconfigure it?
2008-12-23T06:24:00.000Z	Mitsenear		I don't know how, I'm fairly new with this.
2008-12-23T06:25:00.000Z	Zelda		ok hang on. let me get you the command.
2008-12-23T06:25:00.000Z	Zelda		./sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-12-23T06:25:00.000Z	Zelda		type that in terminal.
2008-12-23T06:25:00.000Z	Zelda		- the ./
2008-12-23T06:26:00.000Z	Mitsenear		I need to get to a terminal, though.
2008-12-23T06:26:00.000Z	Zelda		you dont have gui?
2008-12-23T06:26:00.000Z	Mitsenear		Nope.
2008-12-23T06:26:00.000Z	Zelda		well you can still do that from the command line.
2008-12-23T06:27:00.000Z	Zelda		yeah.

2008-12-23T06:27:00.000Z	Mitsenear		Yep, ok, gonna try typing that in.
2008-12-23T06:27:00.000Z	Zelda		ok
2008-12-23T06:28:00.000Z	Zelda		anyone know why my xorg.conf isnt recognizing any of my hardware? I tried to reconfigure X a few times.. nothing seems to work
2008-12-23T06:29:00.000Z	Zelda		Mit: that working?
2008-12-23T06:29:00.000Z	Mitsenear	Zelda	Well, it functions, but it doesn't fix my problem.
