2012-01-21T10:03:00.000Z	mintman	needshelpwithubu	read method 4 . but this would suggest enabling intergrated perpherals and sounds like a windows computer selling point making it impossible to load other OS due to a restart would reset the lan not to work...
2012-01-21T10:04:00.000Z	needshelpwithubu	mintman	already enabled on the bios. I think it's windows not shuting down the ethernet adapter properly, which explains why the light doesn't blink on bootup.
