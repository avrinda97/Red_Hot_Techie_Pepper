2005-08-06T10:00:00.000Z	kabifff		yay official ubuntu help!
2005-08-06T10:01:00.000Z	kabifff		can somebody give me a hand?
2005-08-06T10:02:00.000Z	kabifff		So I installed Ubuntu on my USB HD and now whenever I boot, I have a two-fold problem. One, it can't find the kernel, says "Kernel panic" and quits. Also, if I don't have my USB drive connected, it says "grub error 21" and won't boot any further
2005-08-06T10:03:00.000Z	kabifff		any ideas?
2005-08-06T10:04:00.000Z	kabifff		any ideas, fellas?
2005-08-06T10:05:00.000Z	kabifff		did it work saint france?
2005-08-06T10:07:00.000Z	kabifff		any ideas then why this is happening if it's so easy to use and install?
2005-08-06T10:07:00.000Z	Agamotto	kabifff	 Because nothing descends into manifestation without errors
2005-08-06T10:09:00.000Z	Agamotto	kabifff	 Restate problem for me again
2005-08-06T10:10:00.000Z	kabifff	Agamotto	Ubuntu won't load for anything. It loads the kernel and then says "Kernel Panic, killin INIT" or something close. It works with the live disk and all, just not as a boot. it's on a USB drive, if that helps.
2005-08-06T10:11:00.000Z	Agamotto	kabifff	 A kernel panic is usually due to a module search failure
2005-08-06T10:11:00.000Z	kabifff	Agamotto	I don't know what that means. How do I fix it, if possible?
2005-08-06T10:11:00.000Z	Agamotto	kabifff	 I am not sure, but I would assume it would involve a recompile of your kernel
2005-08-06T10:12:00.000Z	kabifff	Agamotto	ok, dumb it down as best you can. I'm as green as it gets when it comes to anything other than windows. what are you telling me?
2005-08-06T10:13:00.000Z	Agamotto	kabifff	 The kernel panic is due to the kernel not finding some module/s when it is putting itself together for boot.  My guess would be the loopback filesystem module/s, which are responsible for turning your usb stick into a / partition
2005-08-06T10:14:00.000Z	Agamotto	kabifff	 Unfortunately, this sort of thing is beyond my current skill level
2005-08-06T10:15:00.000Z	kabifff	Agamotto	ok, any ideas on how I can un-install this? My Grub is all messed up now too,whenever I boot up and don't have my external plugged in, all I get is a DOS style screen saying "Grub error 21" and I need to reboot with the USB plugged in.
2005-08-06T10:16:00.000Z	Agamotto	kabifff	 Yes, because GRUB expects to find a volume at /usb or whatever.  I am not sure how to fix the problem
2005-08-06T10:18:00.000Z	kabifff	Agamotto	Any ideas on where I can fix this? I had the same problem with Linspire (is that a bad word around here? :-D)  and that REALLY screwed up my grub. I don't want to have to be stuck with an External HD boot for the rest of eternity on my laptop.
2005-08-06T10:18:00.000Z	Agamotto	kabifff	 I am not expert with GRUB editing
2005-08-06T10:19:00.000Z	kabifff	Agamotto	would anybody here know what to do with Grub?
2005-08-06T10:19:00.000Z	Agamotto	kabifff	 Ask.  Basic idea is - How do I remove a USB key entry from my GRUB boot list
