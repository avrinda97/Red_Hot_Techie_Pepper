2009-10-11T06:22:00.000Z	devdude	pjustice13	first I'd do an update
2009-10-11T06:22:00.000Z	devdude	pjustice13	just to get the latest
2009-10-11T06:23:00.000Z	pjustice13	devdude	I've already updated. Are you talking about a specific update?
2009-10-11T06:23:00.000Z	devdude	pjustice13	nope, just to get the latest.. now what I'd try is go to hardware drivers
2009-10-11T06:24:00.000Z	devdude	pjustice13	it should say your card.. but um
2009-10-11T06:24:00.000Z	devdude	pjustice13	I haven't had many driver issues actually..ever.
2009-10-11T06:25:00.000Z	pjustice13	devdude	ok let me look
2009-10-11T06:27:00.000Z	pjustice13	devdude	I have an alternate atheros madwifi driver and it is activated
2009-10-11T06:27:00.000Z	devdude	pjustice13	its defective on my ver of ubuntu, after I de-activated it, it wa fine again
2009-10-11T06:27:00.000Z	pjustice13	devdude	ok I'll try that, did you have to do a restart for it to start working
2009-10-11T06:29:00.000Z	pjustice13	devdude	do you have to do a restart before it will work?
2009-10-11T06:29:00.000Z	devdude	pjustice13	yes.
2009-10-11T06:30:00.000Z	pjustice13	devdude	ok thanks!
2009-10-11T06:37:00.000Z	devdude	pjustice13	preferences -> mouse, touchpad, enable mouse clicks with touchpad (this usually solves the problem, IF that is what it is)
2009-10-11T06:38:00.000Z	pjustice13	devdude	ok I'll try that
2009-10-11T06:40:00.000Z	pjustice13	devdude	that didn't work, the wireless still won't log on to my network
2009-10-11T06:40:00.000Z	devdude	pjustice13	no no I just meant so it doesn't add random characters..
2009-10-11T06:41:00.000Z	devdude	pjustice13	like you want to put in your password but it adds stuff you didn't type right
2009-10-11T06:42:00.000Z	pjustice13	devdude	no I put in the correct password and it won't log on, so I checked to make sure I typed the password correctly and it showed up as random numbers and letters
2009-10-11T06:45:00.000Z	pjustice13	devdude	do you know of a solution to this
