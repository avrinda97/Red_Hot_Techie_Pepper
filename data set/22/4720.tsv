2007-10-26T19:23:00.000Z	kopps		what is 1024x768x32?
2007-10-26T19:24:00.000Z	Pici	kopps	Resolution and color depth. Although 32bit color is really 24bit with an 8 bit buffer.

2007-10-26T19:26:00.000Z	kopps	Pici	so 32 behind there is 32 bit,right?
2007-10-26T19:26:00.000Z	Pici	kopps	Windows calls it 32bit. Linux calls it 24bits. but its the same thing.
2007-10-26T19:27:00.000Z	kopps	Pici	actually,i got a problem.i can't even boot into 7.10 livecd sucessfully
2007-10-26T19:28:00.000Z	Pici	kopps	The live CD doesnt work on all computers to install, you could try the alternate CD.
2007-10-26T19:28:00.000Z	kopps	Pici	i already tried,but still does not works
2007-10-26T19:29:00.000Z	Pici	kopps	Do you get an error?
2007-10-26T19:29:00.000Z	kopps	Pici	cannot display this video mode
2007-10-26T19:30:00.000Z	Pici	kopps	Like a monitor error? or an actuall OS error
2007-10-26T19:31:00.000Z	kopps	Pici	i think is monitor error
2007-10-26T19:31:00.000Z	Pici	kopps	Did you successfully install with the Alternate CD?
2007-10-26T19:32:00.000Z	kopps	Pici	yeah,when my pc boot "cannot display this video mode" keep showing up
2007-10-26T19:32:00.000Z	Pici	kopps	if you press ctrl-alt-f1 do you see a login prompt?
2007-10-26T19:34:00.000Z	kopps	Pici	i never try it before,i am still a newbie :P
2007-10-26T19:37:00.000Z	kopps	Pici	is that makes any difference if i press ctrl+alt f1?
2007-10-26T19:37:00.000Z	Pici	kopps	do er, no, do you get a login screen or still the error on your screen?
2007-10-26T19:39:00.000Z	kopps	Pici	can i use this method too in 7.10 livecd?
2007-10-26T19:39:00.000Z	Pici	kopps	no, it sounds like the liveCD isnt going to work for you.
2007-10-26T19:41:00.000Z	kopps	Pici	i remember when i install using alternate cd,i do enable all resolution settings but it still does not works
