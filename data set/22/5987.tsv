2007-01-10T14:56:00.000Z	QuaLjyn		jowi, nope
2007-01-10T14:57:00.000Z	QuaLjyn		jowi, actually that was what i did before i joined here. Then i changes the computer i'm on irc from, and switched to wireless. So the cable and port i working - this is what is so darn strange - it's like i'm just being ignored ;)
2007-01-10T14:58:00.000Z	QuaLjyn		nope
2007-01-10T14:59:00.000Z	stefg	QuaLjyn	and ifconfig tells what?
2007-01-10T14:59:00.000Z	QuaLjyn	stefg	if i set a static ip, it shows that, and otherwise it just shows the two nics (the one with link and the one that's just being there)
2007-01-10T15:00:00.000Z	stefg	QuaLjyn	hmmm... shifting interface names eth0 get eth1 and vice versa?
2007-01-10T15:01:00.000Z	QuaLjyn	stefg	actually i've been shuffling with my nics during the last few hours. As a part of my debugging attemts
2007-01-10T15:01:00.000Z	QuaLjyn	stefg	cleaned up my /etc/network/interfaces so it only shows the one with link (eth1)
2007-01-10T15:02:00.000Z	stefg	QuaLjyn	and /etc/resolv.conf contains a valid name-server?
2007-01-10T15:02:00.000Z	QuaLjyn	stefg	has been keeping this on a straight ip based level so far
2007-01-10T15:03:00.000Z	stefg	QuaLjyn	ok, i see... just went through the usual drill :-)
2007-01-10T15:05:00.000Z	stefg	QuaLjyn	hmm... firmware issues? does the card require some firmware uploaded at boottime?
2007-01-10T15:06:00.000Z	QuaLjyn	stefg	actually i wouldn't know - didn't notice anything appearing - but i'm not that accomplished either in the deeper arts of ubuntu/linux :S
2007-01-10T15:07:00.000Z	stefg	QuaLjyn	what does lspci think about your NIC's make and model?
2007-01-10T15:09:00.000Z	QuaLjyn	stefg	here goes with your name in front :) -- It believes (quite correctly) that i has my "01:0c.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 19)"
2007-01-10T15:11:00.000Z	QuaLjyn	stefg	i made a typo btw - it's rev 10
2007-01-10T15:13:00.000Z	stefg	QuaLjyn	a quick google query resulted in a couple of hits which tell that it /should/ work... so it's on the HCL
2007-01-10T15:13:00.000Z	stefg	QuaLjyn	HCL == Hardware Compatibility List
2007-01-10T15:13:00.000Z	QuaLjyn	stefg	ahh
2007-01-10T15:14:00.000Z	QuaLjyn	stefg	i've been trawling the forums before i joined here, and seeing a lot having problems back in 5.04 and a few in 6.06. And tried what they tried, but alas :|
2007-01-10T15:16:00.000Z	stefg	QuaLjyn	so you are using edgy, right? Have you tried if a Dapper (6.06 LTS) Desktop-CD works with your card? Edgy is sometimes, errmmm, a bit bitchy
2007-01-10T15:17:00.000Z	QuaLjyn	stefg	i think i will go to bed, and tomorrow test the 6.06 lts. but thanks for the help - really appreciated :)
