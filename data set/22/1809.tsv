2011-08-29T02:04:00.000Z	meowsus	usr13	was that directed at me?
2011-08-29T02:05:00.000Z	usr13	meowsus	cd ; zip -r Some_Directory.zip Desktop/Some_Directory/
2011-08-29T02:05:00.000Z	usr13	meowsus	Yes, sorry, just woke up.
2011-08-29T02:07:00.000Z	usr13	meowsus	If you put the * at the end, it will get the files, without the * at the end it will keep them with Some_Directory/
2011-08-29T02:08:00.000Z	usr13	meowsus	See:  man zip
2011-08-29T02:08:00.000Z	meowsus	usr13	no problem. So the "cd ;" part will keep it from putting all of the subdirectories in it
2011-08-29T02:11:00.000Z	usr13	meowsus	No.  The cd part will put you back in /home/meowsus and that is where Some_Directory.zip will be saved, otherwize Some_Directory.zip will be stored on ~/Desktop or where ever it was.  I was not clear on where you were because you said you were in ~/Desktop and yet your command was to run zip on ../Dropbox/Some_Directory/*  So it was the only way I could figure out how to show you a command that would work.
2011-08-29T02:13:00.000Z	usr13	meowsus	It is a little difficult when using hypothetical directory paths.
2011-08-29T02:14:00.000Z	meowsus	usr13	Sorry about that, I should have been more clear. I was actually wondering why the zip command was adding subdirectories to the zip file when I was creating it. So if i was on my Desktop and the directory i was trying to link to was, say, at ../Dropbox/Some_Directory/ then my zip file shows three directories before the files.
2011-08-29T02:16:00.000Z	usr13	meowsus	man zip
2011-08-29T02:19:00.000Z	usr13	meowsus	You should  read the man file and experiment.  After reading the man file, create a directory and a subdirectory withn that directory.  cd to the diretory and copy some files into the subdirectory and paractice making a zip archive with or without the subdirectory in it.
2011-09-20T05:44:00.000Z	usr13	meowsus	yes
2011-10-25T06:00:00.000Z	usr13	meowsus	You use gedit to edit html code?  Are there plugins that aid it?
2011-10-25T06:02:00.000Z	meowsus	usr13	with gnome2 you can find "gmate" on git that has a ton of textmate esque plugins
2011-10-25T06:02:00.000Z	meowsus	usr13	I've gotten quite used to it actually ;)
2011-10-25T06:05:00.000Z	usr13	meowsus	I've probably used vim more than antying else, but CMS does the most for me nowdays
2011-10-25T06:05:00.000Z	meowsus	usr13	cms! I'm intrigued
2011-10-25T06:05:00.000Z	usr13	meowsus	I've also used bluefish
2011-10-25T06:06:00.000Z	usr13	meowsus	Oh yea, cms is the wave of the future
2011-10-25T06:06:00.000Z	usr13	meowsus	This is OT, we should go to #ubuntu-offtopic   or pm
