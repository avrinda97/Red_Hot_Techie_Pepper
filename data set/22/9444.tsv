2004-11-05T09:27:00.000Z	malte		hi, does anyone know why firefox-installer says: "./firefox-installer-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" on my recently installed ubuntu system? libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0 is in /usr/lib and is a symlink to libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0.400.10 in the same directory
