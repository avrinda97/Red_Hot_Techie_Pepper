2010-05-04T00:20:00.000Z	Name141		how would I change my SSH port? in /etc/ssh/ssh_config ?
2010-05-04T00:20:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	Name141	 You mean to host ssh?
2010-05-04T00:21:00.000Z	Name141	CogitoErgoSam	the port in which it uses , I want to change it from 22
2010-05-04T00:21:00.000Z	Name141	CogitoErgoSam	to something else
2010-05-04T00:22:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	Name141	 To change the listen port, look in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2010-05-04T00:23:00.000Z	Name141	CogitoErgoSam	there we are
2010-05-04T00:23:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	Name141	 /etc/ssh/sshd_config is the one for hosted ssh connections / listening daemon.   ssh_config is the client settings for when you're connecting to a different server
2010-05-04T00:23:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	Name141	 Remember that after you change the listen port for SSH you'll need to restart the service
2010-05-04T00:25:00.000Z	Name141	CogitoErgoSam	sudo /etc/init.d/ssh reload ?
2010-05-04T00:25:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	Name141	 Any luck?
2010-05-04T00:25:00.000Z	Name141	CogitoErgoSam	yes
2010-05-04T00:25:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	Name141	 I think so, I just did stop / start
2010-05-04T00:26:00.000Z	Name141	CogitoErgoSam	it seems all of my ports are blocked at the NOC though
2010-05-04T00:26:00.000Z	Name141	CogitoErgoSam	silly ISP
2010-05-04T00:26:00.000Z	Name141	CogitoErgoSam	I might as well change it back to 22
2010-05-04T00:26:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	Name141	 If you're behind a firewall remember to set up port forwarding
2010-05-04T00:26:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	Name141	firewall/router
2010-05-04T00:26:00.000Z	Name141	CogitoErgoSam	I did.  However I'm using it as a switch
2010-05-04T00:27:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	Name141	 I'm not a real big networking type but I think if you're usin a router as a switch doesn't it still act as a managed one with forwarding and stuff?  The diff is just that its not doing DHCP leases?
2010-05-04T00:28:00.000Z	Name141	CogitoErgoSam	the modem does the DHCP
2010-05-04T00:29:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam		You don't really ned to make an xorg.conf, but several tools generate one like the nvidia settings app.  You can also create one with "sudo Xorg -configure" but it won't work while X is active
2010-05-04T00:29:00.000Z	Name141	CogitoErgoSam	I just need to move to town and get off of sat internet.
