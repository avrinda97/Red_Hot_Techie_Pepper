2011-07-29T16:13:00.000Z	ionite_	WaltherFI	so what should i do now?
2011-07-29T16:14:00.000Z	WaltherFI	ionite_	try typing jockey-gtk on the terminal or the unity shell if you're running 11.04
2011-07-29T16:14:00.000Z	ionite_	WaltherFI	why i'm puzzled is that why does nvidia allow a driver that doesn't work on natty or is it natty cannot handle the old graphics card?
2011-07-29T16:17:00.000Z	WaltherFI	ionite_	well, nvidia does allow you to install thw drivers, but ubuntu can't support every driver version of every gpu so i'd go with the recommended drivers from jockey-gtk
2011-07-29T16:17:00.000Z	WaltherFI	ionite_	and i'm sure that when you'll have the correct, functioning drivers on, you can change your resolution
2011-07-29T16:18:00.000Z	ionite_	WaltherFI	i'm totally noob to terminal and just came out from the cluthes of Windows XP pro. please advise me.
2011-07-29T16:19:00.000Z	WaltherFI	ionite_	you can find the jockey app from the menu also. It is called 'Additional drivers' or something similar
2011-07-29T16:19:00.000Z	WaltherFI	ionite_	or, just type jockey-gtk to the terminal and press enter
2011-07-29T16:21:00.000Z	WaltherFI	ionite_	Yeah, so pop up a terminal and type jockey-gtk and press enter
2011-07-29T16:21:00.000Z	WaltherFI	ionite_	and then, doubleclick the 'current' driver, let it install it
2011-07-29T16:22:00.000Z	WaltherFI	ionite_	Did the additional drivers thing pop up?
2011-07-29T16:23:00.000Z	WaltherFI	ionite_	did you open the jockey-gtk?
2011-07-29T16:23:00.000Z	ionite_	WaltherFI	i already had my latest driver installed.
2011-07-29T16:23:00.000Z	ionite_	WaltherFI	yes.
2011-07-29T16:24:00.000Z	WaltherFI	ionite_	did you install the 'nvidia-current' from there
2011-07-29T16:24:00.000Z	ionite_	WaltherFI	how do i install current from additional drivers?
2011-07-29T16:24:00.000Z	WaltherFI	ionite_	doubleclick the driver on the list that is labeled current and recommended
2011-07-29T16:27:00.000Z	ionite_	WaltherFI	on my additional driver screen there's no current or recommended buttons
2011-07-29T16:27:00.000Z	WaltherFI	ionite_	there should be a list of drivers, one of which has 'current' in its name
2011-07-29T16:27:00.000Z	ionite_	WaltherFI	i'll do a print screen for yer.
2011-07-29T16:28:00.000Z	WaltherFI	ionite_	great
