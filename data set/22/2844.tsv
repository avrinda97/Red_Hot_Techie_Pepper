2009-02-16T10:37:00.000Z	illumin8		is it possible to repartiion my drive in ubuntu (currently its the only os on the machine) without creating problems?
2009-02-16T10:38:00.000Z	illumin8		repartition
2009-02-16T10:38:00.000Z	letalis	illumin8	well itll depend on how your filesystems are setup
2009-02-16T10:38:00.000Z	illumin8	letalis	im attempting to put some other debian based oses on the machine like the new debian 5.0
2009-02-16T10:39:00.000Z	letalis		well if /home is a separate partiton on the machine, there might be hope
2009-02-16T10:39:00.000Z	illumin8	letalis	all my file system is set up on one drive i believe with Home folder being the majority of memory
2009-02-16T10:39:00.000Z	illumin8	letalis	how can i pull up something you can see to judge the setup?
2009-02-16T10:40:00.000Z	letalis		otherwise, if it resides in / on the same filesystem, you may run into some issues with the new installer bloing away all that was on it
2009-02-16T10:40:00.000Z	letalis		type df -h in a console
2009-02-16T10:40:00.000Z	letalis		itll tell you what is mounted where
2009-02-16T10:40:00.000Z	illumin8	letalis	k
2009-02-16T10:41:00.000Z	letalis	illumin8	if you do not implicitly see /home as a mount point, you could have issues keeping your personal information in a new install
2009-02-16T10:42:00.000Z	letalis		and if youre like me and dont use the ext3 filesystem at all that could further complicate things
2009-02-16T10:42:00.000Z	illumin8	letalis	i see / but / is not home?
2009-02-16T10:42:00.000Z	letalis		nope / is the main filesystem that all others resde in
2009-02-16T10:42:00.000Z	letalis		reside
2009-02-16T10:42:00.000Z	illumin8		Ah ok
2009-02-16T10:43:00.000Z	illumin8		So it will require me to set up multiple partions then reinstall all the oses.
2009-02-16T10:43:00.000Z	letalis		if home was not implicitly listed in the df command, the /home is in / and that means more than likely that everything on / wil get blown away in a new install
2009-02-16T10:43:00.000Z	letalis		your best bet will be to backup the /home folder to another device
2009-02-16T10:44:00.000Z	letalis		then do it.
2009-02-16T10:44:00.000Z	illumin8	letalis	thanks for the great info :)
