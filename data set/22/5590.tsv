2007-04-08T10:38:00.000Z	shawn34	lilphil	hey im back, it locked up again during the shutdown proccess
2007-04-08T10:38:00.000Z	shawn34	lilphil	and ndiswrapper is still loading
2007-04-08T10:40:00.000Z	lilphil	shawn34	that's odd :) how did you blacklist it?
2007-04-08T10:40:00.000Z	shawn34	lilphil	i removed it from the modprob.d dir
2007-04-08T10:41:00.000Z	shawn34	lilphil	did put blacklist in front of it
2007-04-08T10:42:00.000Z	shawn34	lilphil	is that ok? to just deleted ndiswrapper from modprobe.d?
2007-04-08T10:43:00.000Z	lilphil	shawn34	did you add it to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist ?
2007-04-08T10:54:00.000Z	shawn34	lilphil	still loading it
2007-04-08T10:55:00.000Z	shawn34	lilphil	blacklisted ndis but its still loading, how is that possible
2007-04-08T10:56:00.000Z	shawn34	lilphil	are you there?
2007-04-08T10:56:00.000Z	lilphil	shawn34	yeah. not sure what could be doing that - ive not used ndiswrapper for a long time
2007-04-08T10:58:00.000Z	shawn34	lilphil	when i type lsmod i see this: ndiswrapper           208656  0
2007-04-08T10:59:00.000Z	lilphil	shawn34	oh, I think you have to use update-modules. sorry :x
2007-04-08T10:59:00.000Z	lilphil	shawn34	forgot that bit...
2007-04-08T11:00:00.000Z	lilphil	shawn34	although the manpage says it is obsolete
2007-04-08T11:00:00.000Z	lilphil	shawn34	hmm, i'm just reading - hang on
2007-04-08T11:03:00.000Z	lilphil	shawn34	tried grepping through /etc/modules.d for any other instances of ndiswrapper?
2007-04-08T11:03:00.000Z	lilphil	shawn34	also, aparrently modules.d is ignored if you have a modules.conf
2007-04-08T11:03:00.000Z	shawn34	lilphil	how do i do that
2007-04-08T11:04:00.000Z	lilphil	shawn34	 grep -r ndis /etc/modprobe.d/
2007-04-08T11:04:00.000Z	shawn34	lilphil	all blacklisted
2007-04-08T11:06:00.000Z	lilphil	shawn34	i'm not sure, sorry. I suppose you could always move ndiswrapper module out of the way for testing to see if that is actually causing the issue, but I wouldnt reccomend it
