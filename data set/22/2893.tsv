2009-02-02T12:12:00.000Z	bnagy		hey, dumb-sounding question - apt-get installed irssi but it doesn't show up as a command, nor is it in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin
2009-02-02T12:13:00.000Z	bnagy		k 2 secs
2009-02-02T12:14:00.000Z	rww	bnagy	irssi should install to /usr/bin/ =/
2009-02-02T12:15:00.000Z	bnagy	rww	yeah, that's what I thought. :( man pages are there and apt thinks it is installed
2009-02-02T12:15:00.000Z	rww	bnagy	That's odd. What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2009-02-02T12:20:00.000Z	rww	bnagy	sudo apt-get purge irssi && sudo apt-get install irssi
2009-02-02T12:20:00.000Z	rww	bnagy	that'll reinstall it; might help
2009-02-02T12:22:00.000Z	rww	bnagy	copy the output of "apt-cache policy irssi" to http://paste.ubuntu.com/, then put a link to the created page here.
2009-02-02T12:23:00.000Z	bnagy	rww	it's only two lines....
2009-02-02T12:23:00.000Z	rww	bnagy	oh. Just paste it here then (I'm not on Ubuntu right now; forgot how long/short it was)
2009-02-02T12:26:00.000Z	rww	bnagy	hrm. that looks fine too.
2009-02-02T12:27:00.000Z	bnagy	rww	it didn't seem to delete the package when I purged... maybe I can try that and/por use a different repo?
2009-02-02T12:27:00.000Z	rww	bnagy	yeah, I guess
2009-02-02T12:56:00.000Z	bnagy	rww	if you're interested, removing and DLing from main repo worked. My fastest repo's copy must be broken or something weird
2009-02-18T13:52:00.000Z	rww	bnagy	pretty sure xulrunner isn't a dependency of sudo =/
2010-06-06T08:07:00.000Z	rww	bnagy	I am using a properly-configured client. He's using a non-standard character set.
2010-06-06T08:08:00.000Z	bnagy	rww	Shows up fine here, and I' don't have any japanese fonts - I'm just using plain ol irssi. Anyway, it's not life and death.
2010-06-06T08:23:00.000Z	rww	bnagy	fyi, I just installed Ubuntu's default non-Latin font set and oheyu's stuff now shows up fine, so yes, it was fonts.
2010-06-06T08:24:00.000Z	bnagy	rww	did you try just setting the system charset? I'm not trying to be smart, just asking
2010-06-06T08:25:00.000Z	rww	bnagy	my entire stack from irc client, through screen, to my terminal is set to utf8. It's a font thing. Like I said, I installed fonts, it now works.
2010-06-06T08:26:00.000Z	bnagy	rww	right, but if you do export CHARSET=ISO-8859-15 shouldn't that also fix it?
2010-06-06T08:26:00.000Z	rww	bnagy	I have no idea, and this isn't something I intend to do.
