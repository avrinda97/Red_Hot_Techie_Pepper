2005-12-09T13:15:00.000Z	dabaR	vilefridge	"cat /etc/fstab" and post that to the paste.ubuntulinux.nl web site.

2005-12-09T13:18:00.000Z	dabaR	vilefridge	can you change your fstab back to what it was before you did that?
2005-12-09T13:19:00.000Z	vilefridge	dabaR	yes, one sec
2005-12-09T13:20:00.000Z	vilefridge	dabaR	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/5384
2005-12-09T13:21:00.000Z	dabaR	vilefridge	oh, so you are saying you needed the whole line for mounting the ntfs?
2005-12-09T13:22:00.000Z	vilefridge	dabaR	 Not necesarily.  This is what i did: eric@unknown:~/Desktop$ sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /home/eric/Desktop/C_NTFS/
2005-12-09T13:23:00.000Z	dabaR	vilefridge	so would you like it mounted every time you boot, or just when you feel like it?
2005-12-09T13:23:00.000Z	vilefridge	dabaR	every time I boot would be nice :)
2005-12-09T13:24:00.000Z	dabaR	vilefridge	then you will need a line in the fstab file. read pm from ubotu
2005-12-09T13:24:00.000Z	vilefridge	dabaR	thank you kindly :)
2005-12-09T13:37:00.000Z	vilefridge	dabaR	 The mount was successful for my Windows D: partition, I'm listening to a .mp3 off my NTFS drive atm :)  However, the C: partition still whines about no permissions.  Is it becaue it has a * beside it?  /dev/hda1   *           1        2297    18450621    7  HPFS/NTFS
2005-12-09T13:37:00.000Z	dabaR	vilefridge	post the file again, so I can take a look.
2005-12-09T13:39:00.000Z	vilefridge	dabaR	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/5386
2005-12-09T13:41:00.000Z	dabaR	vilefridge	and what, you have to be root to read from the drives? writing to ntfs is not something people oftenn do, if they like their files.
2005-12-09T13:42:00.000Z	vilefridge	dabaR	 I don't have any need for the C partition, I kind of just wanted to understand why I couldn't access it, but I could access D w/out a hitch.  I don't need sudo to read from the D, I can browse to it in nautilus
2005-12-09T13:43:00.000Z	dabaR	vilefridge	no idea, the fstab entries look identical.
2005-12-09T13:44:00.000Z	vilefridge	dabaR	only difference I can see is there's a * beside the hda1 (C) part, must mean it's bootable and dances to i'm to sexy for..
2005-12-09T13:45:00.000Z	dabaR	vilefridge	i dont see that
2005-12-09T13:46:00.000Z	vilefridge	dabaR	 /dev/hda1   *            where-as...      /dev/hda5      (no star)
2005-12-09T13:47:00.000Z	dabaR	vilefridge	I do not see that on your post.
2005-12-09T13:48:00.000Z	vilefridge	dabaR	ahh sorry, i see that now :)  Well thanks again for all the help, much appreciated :D :D
