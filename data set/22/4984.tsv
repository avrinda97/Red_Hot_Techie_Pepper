2007-08-23T15:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	evilofisho_	So you have run automatix... bad boy...
2007-08-23T15:13:00.000Z	evilofisho_	Jack_Sparrow	Damnit.
2007-08-23T15:14:00.000Z	evilofisho_	Jack_Sparrow	Well, thanks anyway.
2007-08-23T15:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	evilofisho_	IT is not as simple as uninstalling it.. and the problems it causes are not always immediately seen..
2007-08-23T15:15:00.000Z	evilofisho_	Jack_Sparrow	Yeah, I know. Even if I uninstall it the damage is already done.
2007-08-23T15:17:00.000Z	evilofisho_	Jack_Sparrow	What could be a possible solution?
2007-08-23T15:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	evilofisho_	A fresh install  is the easiest bet...  or a backup prior to using automatix if you have that.
2007-08-23T15:18:00.000Z	evilofisho_	Jack_Sparrow	Alright, thanks for the help.
2007-08-23T15:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	evilofisho_	Wish it was better news...  People here are happy to help you install anything we can the right way

2007-08-23T15:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	evilofisho_	Use live cd to backup your var/cache/apt/archives... and anything else of importance... then full install
2007-08-23T15:27:00.000Z	evilofisho_	Jack_Sparrow	Alright, thanks again.
