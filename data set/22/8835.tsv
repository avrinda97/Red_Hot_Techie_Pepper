2005-08-09T12:44:00.000Z	IcemanV9		what is the best method to back up my home directory (11GB) to another box? then rebuild the box and restore my home directory back from the other box?
2005-08-09T12:44:00.000Z	pestilence	IcemanV9	i like rdiff-backup
2005-08-09T12:46:00.000Z	pestilence	IcemanV9	it allows you to make incremental backups easily, so backing up a 11gb partition can take 1 minute if only 5 megs have changed
2005-08-09T12:48:00.000Z	IcemanV9	pestilence	i was planning to do this once; backup, rebuild, restore
2005-08-09T12:48:00.000Z	pestilence	IcemanV9	it will still work, but it's always a very good idea to backup regularly (read: daily)
2005-08-09T12:49:00.000Z	pestilence	IcemanV9	if you were just doing it once, scp -a should work too...but i prefer rdiff-backup regardless.
2005-08-09T12:49:00.000Z	IcemanV9	pestilence	i know, i know ... it is a good practice to backup daily :)
2005-08-09T12:50:00.000Z	IcemanV9	pestilence	or nc (netcat)
2005-08-09T12:51:00.000Z	pestilence	IcemanV9	hrmmm...something tells me that's not what you want.  but i've never heard of netcat.  also see: rsync (what rdiff-backup uses)
2005-08-09T12:52:00.000Z	IcemanV9	pestilence	ha. i used it once (nc). it took forever over a local network.
2005-08-09T12:53:00.000Z	IcemanV9	pestilence	i was looking for an easiest, fastest method to backup /home dir
2005-08-09T12:54:00.000Z	pestilence	IcemanV9	sudo rdiff-backup /home myuser@remotemachine.com::/my/backup/dir
2005-08-09T12:55:00.000Z	pestilence	IcemanV9	you need rdiff-backup on both machines, of course
2005-08-09T12:57:00.000Z	IcemanV9	pestilence	ok. will try that way. thanks. :)
2008-03-20T21:02:00.000Z	IcemanV9	pestilence	what was your issue? mine wasn't working. :-/ black screen; found out it was missing x-zip plugin
2008-03-20T21:02:00.000Z	pestilence	IcemanV9	it works this year?
2008-03-20T21:03:00.000Z	IcemanV9	pestilence	yes, but all i got is black screen (cannot see anything)
2008-03-20T21:03:00.000Z	pestilence	IcemanV9	oh, well it doesn't even load a plugin for me.  i just get an error message
2008-03-20T21:05:00.000Z	IcemanV9	pestilence	my other box is running on dapper; it gives me an error message saying that i need to update the plugin (new window media player)
2008-03-20T21:05:00.000Z	pestilence	IcemanV9	thats the one
2008-03-20T21:08:00.000Z	IcemanV9	pestilence	dang. yea. i am disappointed that there is no update plugin in the repo. *sigh* even on the latest version of ubuntu, it just showed black screen. pretty much useless.
2008-03-20T21:40:00.000Z	IcemanV9	pestilence	are u still there?
