2008-11-07T15:42:00.000Z	subdolus		anyone able to give me a link to a thread or guide explaining how to create an Ad-Hoc connection in ubuntu while working around the graphical network configuration tool in the tray?
2008-11-07T15:42:00.000Z	subdolus		ad-hoc wifi that is
2008-11-07T15:42:00.000Z	ziroday	subdolus	whats wrong with nm-applet (the network thingy in the tray)
2008-11-07T15:48:00.000Z	subdolus	ziroday	well I can't figure out how to use it to create an ad-hoc connection without any security (WEP, WPA, etc.)
2008-11-07T15:48:00.000Z	ziroday	subdolus	you are using intrepid?
2008-11-07T15:48:00.000Z	subdolus	ziroday	what's intepid?
2008-11-07T15:49:00.000Z	ziroday	subdolus	are you using version 8.10 of ubuntu?
2008-11-07T15:49:00.000Z	subdolus	ziroday	nope, Hardy
2008-11-07T15:49:00.000Z	ziroday	subdolus	ah okay. you might want to do it through System > Administration > Network
2008-11-07T15:52:00.000Z	subdolus	ziroday	hmmm every time I try use admin -> network it tells me the interface doesnt exist, after selecting it and clicking configure
2008-11-07T15:53:00.000Z	ziroday	subdolus	what network card do you have?
2008-11-07T15:54:00.000Z	subdolus	ziroday	should I use roaming profiles with nm-applet just to set up a 2 person adhoc network?
2008-11-11T16:47:00.000Z	ziroday	subdolus	20
2008-11-11T16:48:00.000Z	ziroday	subdolus	how are you adding it and what line are you adding?
2008-11-11T16:49:00.000Z	subdolus	ziroday	49 20 * * *       /usr/bin/fuckintest
2008-11-11T16:50:00.000Z	ziroday	subdolus	work or not work?
2008-11-11T16:51:00.000Z	ziroday	subdolus	does that work or not work?
2008-11-11T16:52:00.000Z	subdolus	ziroday	I'm confused. 20 seems to work now
2008-11-11T16:52:00.000Z	subdolus	ziroday	so what would midnight be?
2008-11-11T16:52:00.000Z	ziroday	subdolus	great
2008-11-11T16:52:00.000Z	ziroday	subdolus	correct I believe
2008-11-11T16:52:00.000Z	subdolus	ziroday	ok cool. thanks
