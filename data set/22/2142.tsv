2011-01-02T03:48:00.000Z	elliott	cheater99	well. yeah. it's the details that are difficult :P
2011-01-02T03:47:00.000Z	cheater99	elliott	you would need to write the img to the drive, load the kernel, set up a ram fs, simply copy files over, then continue booting from that. no idea about the details.
2011-01-02T03:49:00.000Z	cheater99	elliott	my guess is try it first with a simple fat32 partition: make a usb stick that creates an empty fat32 partition, copies over to the fat32. you can then check if that works at all. then try to make it boot. then doing ramfs shouldn't be a big step from that.
2011-01-02T03:49:00.000Z	elliott	cheater99	I have no USB stick.
2011-01-02T03:49:00.000Z	cheater99	elliott	cd then
2011-01-02T03:50:00.000Z	elliott	cheater99	I have no optical drive.
2011-01-02T03:50:00.000Z	elliott	cheater99	Why do you think I want to boot the Live CD from a partition?
2011-01-02T03:50:00.000Z	cheater99	elliott	why not just boot a linux from the partition?
2011-01-02T03:50:00.000Z	cheater99	elliott	can you take out the hdd?
2011-01-02T03:50:00.000Z	elliott	cheater99	that's what I want to do, I want to boot the ubuntu livecd from the partition
2011-01-02T03:50:00.000Z	cheater99	elliott	you can take out laptop hdds
2011-01-02T03:51:00.000Z	cheater99	elliott	how are you going to put data on the hdd if you have no optical drive?
2011-01-02T03:51:00.000Z	elliott	cheater99	um I am sort of connected to the internet?
2011-01-02T03:51:00.000Z	cheater99	elliott	what OS do you have?
2011-01-02T03:52:00.000Z	cheater99	elliott	you could resize the partition with the OS that's on it already, then rip the image of a working ubuntu partition from somewhere and put it on your system
2011-01-02T03:52:00.000Z	cheater99	elliott	then set it to bootable.
2011-01-02T03:52:00.000Z	cheater99	elliott	make sure the grub on the donor system was installed on the partition and not in the mbr.
2011-01-02T03:52:00.000Z	elliott	cheater99	I'm just going to copy the LiveCD files
2011-01-02T03:53:00.000Z	cheater99	elliott	have two partitions
2011-01-02T03:53:00.000Z	cheater99	elliott	you can later remove the livecd partition
2011-01-02T03:54:00.000Z	cheater99	elliott	you can use say partition magic under windows to resize your existing partition without losing data.
2011-01-02T03:55:00.000Z	elliott	cheater99	yeah, i'm fine with resizing.
