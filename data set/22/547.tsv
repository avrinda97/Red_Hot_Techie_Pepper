2011-10-25T14:46:00.000Z	orated		Hello! Its been only three days after installing system that I found /usr partition taking more space. I got 10 GiB for both / and /usr. And /var is given 11GiB . I know its not required to give this much space to the partitions but now I find /usr having only 3.7 GiB free whereas root and var got 8.3 and 9.5 GiB disk space left respectively. Is this normal? How can I increase space for usr?
2011-10-25T14:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	orated	 i tend to just give /    like 30gb.  not sure theres much need for seperate /var or /usr these days
2011-10-30T13:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	orated	 sadly power-management is often picky, and dosent work as well under linux for various reasons.
2011-10-30T13:18:00.000Z	orated	dr_willis	Well, that can drastically reduce the life of processor if its not operating as it should ..
2011-10-30T13:19:00.000Z	orated	dr_willis	Should I ask in #ubuntu-kernel? I just realised they may probably help better :)
2011-10-30T13:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	orated	 you can try i guess..
2011-10-30T13:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	orated	 theres some nasty power-regressions bugs out at this time. I havent paid much attention to it lately
2011-10-30T13:21:00.000Z	orated	dr_willis	Could you link me to any page which gives detailed info on it?
2011-11-18T16:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	orated	 i set my router to give the same ip for my servers. or set them to se static ips
2011-11-18T16:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	orated	 my router has the feature
2011-11-18T16:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	orated	 network manager also has the option
2011-11-18T16:08:00.000Z	orated	dr_willis	Yes, I'm searching that option in router configuration page
2011-11-18T16:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	orated	 its under the dhcp server tab here i think, mac address reservation
2011-11-24T17:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	orated	 if you want to kill the x session remotely. 'sudo service lightdm stop'
2011-11-24T17:42:00.000Z	orated	dr_willis	Yes, stopping display manager is fine with me but will stopping drop the session to tty?
2011-11-24T17:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	orated	 if X is not running.. it will go to the console.
2011-11-24T17:43:00.000Z	orated	dr_willis	What I meant to ask is like how Ctrl+F1 2..etc key combination helps to change the x session, in the same way can that be done from server on a client system when using ssh
2011-11-24T17:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	orated	 cant say ive ever needed to remotely force a remote box to the console..
2011-11-24T17:46:00.000Z	orated	dr_willis	What if I do that on server system itself. One terminal window is open connected to ssh controlling/monitoring it. One more terminal tab opened to control it but with different purpose?
2011-11-24T17:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	orated	 i dont get what you are trying to do.
2011-11-24T17:47:00.000Z	orated	dr_willis	I'll try that
2011-11-27T17:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	orated	 i doubt if it would have any affect at all.
