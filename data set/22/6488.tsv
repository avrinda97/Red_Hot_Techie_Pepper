2006-10-16T05:49:00.000Z	k3nobi		hi, who can I setup write permissions for my external usbdisk?
2006-10-16T05:50:00.000Z	jacked	k3nobi	what file system does is use?
2006-10-16T05:51:00.000Z	k3nobi	jacked	ext3
2006-10-16T05:51:00.000Z	k3nobi	jacked	it's read only for the users
2006-10-16T05:52:00.000Z	jacked	k3nobi	sudo chmod a+rw -R /path/to/device
2006-10-16T05:58:00.000Z	k3nobi	jacked	no that wont help, the problem is on the mount level, not on the node level
2006-10-16T05:58:00.000Z	k3nobi	jacked	the nodes are created dynamically everytime you plug in the ubs device
2006-10-16T06:01:00.000Z	jacked	k3nobi	okay.  well.  umount the device
2006-10-16T06:01:00.000Z	jacked	k3nobi	sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/<device>
2006-10-16T06:02:00.000Z	jacked	k3nobi	then you should be able to reach everything as root
2006-10-16T06:02:00.000Z	jacked	k3nobi	sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/<device> /media/<empty folder>
2006-10-16T06:03:00.000Z	k3nobi	jacked	yes but this is a one time solution, I'm longing more for a generic solution because I usualy turn on and of my client
2006-10-16T06:04:00.000Z	k3nobi	jacked	i could but it in fstab
2006-10-16T06:06:00.000Z	jacked	k3nobi	what is the side of the usb storage device?
2006-10-16T06:06:00.000Z	k3nobi	jacked	the side?
2006-10-16T06:06:00.000Z	jacked	k3nobi	what is the size of the usb storage device?
2006-10-16T06:06:00.000Z	jacked	k3nobi	sorry
2006-10-16T06:06:00.000Z	k3nobi	jacked	arround 30gb
2006-10-16T06:07:00.000Z	jacked	k3nobi	do you have a lot of data on there?  (what I'm getting at is... can you back it up so that you can format the drive)
2006-10-16T06:07:00.000Z	k3nobi	jacked	type /tmp in the url bar
2006-10-16T06:07:00.000Z	k3nobi	jacked	sorry
2006-10-16T06:12:00.000Z	jacked	k3nobi	sorry for the delay here... um, yeah.  fstab is an option too, although it may or may not be the BEST option
