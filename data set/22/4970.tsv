2007-09-03T14:28:00.000Z	Cyrus25801		if i have a file: file.sh how do i install it
2007-09-03T14:29:00.000Z	nbkr	Cyrus25801	make it executable and simply run it.
2007-09-03T14:29:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	nbkr	how do I make it an executable
2007-09-03T14:30:00.000Z	nbkr	Cyrus25801	Or "right-click" it in gnome. There should be an option in the "properties" view.
2007-09-03T14:31:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	nbkr	yes
2007-09-03T14:31:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	nbkr	then
2007-09-03T14:31:00.000Z	nbkr	Cyrus25801	double click it, or run it from the console.
2007-09-03T14:32:00.000Z	nbkr	Cyrus25801	on Console cd to the folder where the file is in. Than do ./file.sh
2007-09-03T14:34:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	nbkr	if i do that it says permission denied. and if i use sudo it says command not found
2007-09-03T14:34:00.000Z	nbkr	Cyrus25801	What command are you exactly running?
2007-09-03T14:35:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	nbkr	sudo ./install-program.sh
2007-09-03T14:36:00.000Z	nbkr	Cyrus25801	Ok, that should be ok. What is the exact output? I'm wondering if the bash says "command not found", meaning that it cant find the script or if the script itself says command not found.
2007-09-03T14:38:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	nbkr	 sudo: ./install-program.sh: command not found
2007-09-03T14:39:00.000Z	nbkr	Cyrus25801	please run ls -l ./install-program.sh and post the results please.
2007-09-03T14:39:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	nbkr	 the funny thing is if i say : sudo su and run the command it says permission denied
2007-09-03T14:40:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	nbkr	 -rw-r--r-- 1 cyrus cyrus 15957213 2005-10-25 18:33 ./install-program.sh
2007-09-03T14:41:00.000Z	nbkr	Cyrus25801	the file isn't executable yet. Do "chmod 0744 ./install-program.sh"
2007-09-03T14:41:00.000Z	nbkr	Cyrus25801	Afterwards do ./install-program.sh
2007-09-03T14:42:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	nbkr	what is the 0744 for
2007-09-03T14:43:00.000Z	nbkr	Cyrus25801	0744 is the oktal value for: Readable,Writeable,Executable for the owner, Readable to group, readable to all others.
