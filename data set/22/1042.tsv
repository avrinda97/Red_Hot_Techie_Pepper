2011-06-16T22:45:00.000Z	roasted		Question - does GNash just work with Flash, or does it work with Shockwave items as well?
2011-06-16T22:46:00.000Z	Pici	roasted	Just flash. There is no shockwave plugin for Linux.
2011-06-16T22:46:00.000Z	roasted	Pici	yeah, I see that, which is kind of a bummer because I think the educational web based software we have utilize some bits of shockwave.
2011-06-22T20:47:00.000Z	Pici	roasted	Yes it does. the ppa is not supported, we don't know what sort of interactions it will have with your system.
2011-06-22T20:48:00.000Z	roasted	Pici	no, it did not answer my question. I understand gnome 3 is not supported, but I'm asking about the interactions with XFCE and 11.04, both officially supported.
2011-06-22T20:48:00.000Z	roasted	Pici	if anything, perhaps I should ask in Xubuntu. Thanks anyway.
2011-06-22T20:49:00.000Z	Pici	roasted	Installing xfce on a stock 11.04 install should not cause any problems. If the gnome3 ppa is installed, I have no idea if it will work or not.
2011-07-14T19:50:00.000Z	Pici	roasted	you may want to ask in #clementine if you can't get an answer here.
2011-07-14T19:50:00.000Z	roasted	Pici	I have for the last two days. The chat is pretty dead, however I heard a lot of users in here recommending Clementine, so I wanted to try my luck in here again.
2011-08-24T21:04:00.000Z	Pici	roasted	Did you look at the links I gave you at all?
2011-08-24T21:04:00.000Z	roasted	Pici	oh yes. I'm reading through them now.
2011-08-24T21:04:00.000Z	roasted	Pici	just continuing a side conversation, that's all. :)
2012-04-17T00:21:00.000Z	Pici	roasted	but make sure that the script itself cannot be edited by that user, only read and executed.
2012-05-29T20:59:00.000Z	Pici	roasted	Do you want to list what packages that PPA provides?
2012-05-29T20:59:00.000Z	roasted	Pici	basically. We're trying to package the .deb's to a specific PPA as part of our main install here, so if I can get the deb's physically downloaded, I'm golden.
2012-05-29T20:59:00.000Z	Pici	roasted	Just grab them from the PPA's launchpad page then.
2012-05-29T21:00:00.000Z	roasted	Pici	good thought. I didn't think of that.
2012-05-29T21:00:00.000Z	roasted	Pici	appreciate it!
2012-09-13T21:32:00.000Z	Pici	roasted	did you run ncdu with sudo?
2012-09-13T21:32:00.000Z	roasted	Pici	no... *dupr durp*
2012-09-13T21:32:00.000Z	roasted	Pici	err, I forgot, I'm already at the root prompt
2012-09-13T21:32:00.000Z	roasted	Pici	so "yes"?
