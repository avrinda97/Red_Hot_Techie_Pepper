2010-07-20T19:26:00.000Z	econdudeawesome		Hey, what is a good place to look to see dependencies for, say, openbox and chromium web browser? I am installing ubuntu minimal on a box that requires a log-in via browser (i don't know any other way to authenticate with the network)
2010-07-20T19:26:00.000Z	econdudeawesome		Or is there an all-inclusive way to install elinks on top of ubuntu minimal?
2010-07-20T19:26:00.000Z	thewanderer1	econdudeawesome	apt-get install elinks
2010-07-20T19:27:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	thewanderer1	that would require me to have authenticated with the network--which I can't do right off unless I have a browser, so I have to have the packages handy
2010-07-20T19:27:00.000Z	thewanderer1	econdudeawesome	you might have w3m installed
2010-07-20T19:28:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	thewanderer1	is that a browser similar to elinks?
2010-07-20T19:28:00.000Z	thewanderer1	econdudeawesome	somewhat
2010-07-20T19:28:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	thewanderer1	does it handle cookies?
2010-07-20T19:29:00.000Z	thewanderer1	econdudeawesome	yup
2010-07-20T19:29:00.000Z	thewanderer1	econdudeawesome	failing that, if you have no other option there's always netcat and the HTTP protocol
2010-07-20T19:30:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	thewanderer1	Can you give me some idea as to how that would work?
2010-07-20T19:30:00.000Z	thewanderer1	econdudeawesome	what exactly? HTTP? see the protocol RFC
2010-07-20T19:31:00.000Z	thewanderer1	econdudeawesome	netcat [HOST] [PORT] and there you go
2010-07-20T19:31:00.000Z	thewanderer1	econdudeawesome	I hope you have elinks there
2010-07-20T19:31:00.000Z	thewanderer1	econdudeawesome	or links at least
2010-07-20T19:31:00.000Z	thewanderer1	econdudeawesome	if not then you're better off copying the deb to there and installing some browser
2010-07-20T19:31:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	thewanderer1	elinks would be sufficient, but I dont think it comes with ubuntu minimal install :-D
2010-07-20T19:32:00.000Z	thewanderer1	econdudeawesome	you have to get any browser on your system, I don't think you'd feel comfortable with writing HTTP requests by hand
2010-07-20T19:33:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	thewanderer1	it would be an experience, for sure
2010-07-20T20:43:00.000Z	thewanderer1	econdudeawesome	download it from packages.ubuntu.com, put it on a pendrive along with all dependencies, and install with dpkg from there
2010-07-20T20:43:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	thewanderer1	you rock man, I appreciate it
2010-07-21T01:25:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	thewanderer1	thanks for your help
