2010-09-20T02:29:00.000Z	dzeremis		I hate to beg but somebody please help!
2010-09-20T02:29:00.000Z	quant	dzeremis	what's up?
2010-09-20T02:31:00.000Z	dzeremis	quant	Thanks for responding! I'm trying to get to ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/iTunes/iTunes.exe to be accessible through the Ubuntu file manager. I can only get to it via terminal at wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/iTunes/iTunes.exe
2010-09-20T02:32:00.000Z	quant	dzeremis	what do you mean by "trying to get to ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/iTunes/iTunes.exe to be accessible through the Ubuntu file manager"?
2010-09-20T02:32:00.000Z	dzeremis	quant	It's hidden in the File Manager. All I'm trying to do is create a shortcut to put under Applications but I'm having trouble doing even that. I can't access it through the file manager, only the terminal. What to do??
2010-09-20T02:33:00.000Z	quant	dzeremis	I don't see why it would be hidden, but press CTRL+H in the file manager
2010-09-20T02:38:00.000Z	quant	dzeremis	you can make a shortcut for that command and place it in the launch bar
2010-09-20T02:38:00.000Z	dzeremis	quant	--> That would be magnificent! How do I do this?
2010-09-20T02:39:00.000Z	quant	dzeremis	right click the bar, choose add custom application and follow the menu
2010-09-20T02:39:00.000Z	dzeremis	quant	let me try this.
2010-09-20T02:39:00.000Z	quant	dzeremis	first choose the add to panel option
2010-09-20T02:40:00.000Z	dzeremis	quant	--> Thanks for saying that. I was about to ask.
2010-09-20T02:40:00.000Z	dzeremis	quant	You know, I think I actually tried this once before. But let me retry.
2010-09-20T02:44:00.000Z	dzeremis	quant	et al.: Hi again! All right, I tried setting up a shortcut for the command "wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/iTunes/iTunes.exe" and had no luck. Could the CAPS have any bearing on it?
2010-09-20T02:44:00.000Z	quant	dzeremis	what was the error? what did you get?
2010-09-20T02:45:00.000Z	dzeremis	quant	I got no error message at all. I clicked the shortcut and nothing loaded at all. I tried elimating the wine command just to see what would happen and got an error message saying it could not execute it.
2010-09-20T02:46:00.000Z	quant	dzeremis	make sure tha paths, caps etc. are correct
2010-09-20T02:46:00.000Z	dzeremis	quant	iTunes works just fine executed by terminal but not by Ubuntu.
2010-09-20T02:46:00.000Z	dzeremis	quant	let me try different combinations. BRB.
2010-09-20T02:46:00.000Z	quant	dzeremis	don't try different combos, try the right one :)
2010-09-20T03:15:00.000Z	quant	dzeremis	applications -> wine -> uninstall wine programs
2010-09-20T03:15:00.000Z	dzeremis	quant	/ SolarisBoy: Okay, got it
