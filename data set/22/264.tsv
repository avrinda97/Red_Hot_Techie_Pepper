2012-02-13T15:51:00.000Z	onasis		ok well i dont know much about ubuntu

2012-02-13T15:54:00.000Z	onasis		ah thanks werder
2012-02-13T15:54:00.000Z	onasis		thats all i need to know
2012-02-13T15:55:00.000Z	onasis		gonna probably backup everything and start again anyways as im gonna have a treble boot osx/win7/ubuntu studio
2012-02-13T15:55:00.000Z	damo22	onasis	probably better to use osx as host and run others in VM
2012-02-13T15:58:00.000Z	damo22	onasis	complain to avid for not having linux release
2012-02-13T15:58:00.000Z	onasis	damo22	i wont waste my breath i think! lol!
2012-02-13T16:34:00.000Z	damo22	onasis	in my opinion you cant get better than protools and all the waves plugins but you cant run them in linux
2012-02-13T16:35:00.000Z	onasis	damo22	yes i agree i have a protools hd system running with a hackintosh
2012-02-13T16:35:00.000Z	damo22	onasis	i hope you are running the vanilla kernel
2012-02-13T16:35:00.000Z	damo22	onasis	it is freebsd renamed
2012-02-13T16:36:00.000Z	damo22	onasis	you already have the pci card for protools its not supported in linux why bother with it
2012-02-13T16:37:00.000Z	onasis	damo22	this is all stuff i dont know, thats why im here asking
2012-02-13T16:38:00.000Z	damo22	onasis	you already have protools HD what more do you want? lol
2012-02-13T16:38:00.000Z	onasis	damo22	a more solid system! lol!
2012-02-13T16:39:00.000Z	damo22	onasis	if you want rock solid protools performance, buy a real mac and dont rip any plugins buy everything
2012-02-13T16:42:00.000Z	damo22	onasis	i know for a fact that using non standard mac kernels can screw up stability
