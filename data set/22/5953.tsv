2007-02-22T14:40:00.000Z	vlt		I set "$fontpath = /usr/share/fonts/X11/..." in  /etc/vnc.conf but when I start vncserver it complains about missing "/usr/share/X11/fonts/" (that's a different path). What's wrong here?
2007-02-22T14:41:00.000Z	unop	vlt	 whats wrong with setting   fontpath=/usr/share/fonts/X11/
2007-02-22T14:42:00.000Z	vlt	unop	nothing, I did that (except for the leading "$" from the used perl syntax in he conf file)
2007-02-22T14:43:00.000Z	unop	vlt	 no i mean -- "$fontpath = /usr/share/fonts/X11/" instead of "$fontpath = /usr/share/fonts/X11/..."

2007-02-22T14:49:00.000Z	vlt	unop	That's what I added to /etc/vnc.conf
2007-02-22T14:50:00.000Z	vlt	unop	But that paths doesn't exist on my system. It's rather called /usr/share/fonts/X11
2007-02-22T14:50:00.000Z	vlt	unop	I'm running Edgy
2007-02-22T14:51:00.000Z	unop	vlt	 well, whats what i mean, use that path there /usr/share/fonts/X11
2007-02-22T14:51:00.000Z	unop	vlt	the font lookup should be rather recursive and dig into subdirectories
2007-02-22T14:52:00.000Z	vlt	unop	Yes, I did that: I replaced every "/X11/fonts/" by "/fonts/X11("
2007-02-22T14:52:00.000Z	unop	vlt	 dont guess, use the paths that exist on your system
2007-02-22T14:54:00.000Z	vlt	unop	On my system there's a path /usr/share/fonts/X11/ containing 100dpi and others.
2007-02-22T14:54:00.000Z	vlt	unop	the error msg vncserver gives m is: "Could not init font path element /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc/, removing from list!"
2007-02-22T14:54:00.000Z	vlt	unop	It's still looking i the wrong path.
2007-02-22T14:55:00.000Z	unop	vlt	 hmm, there must be another declaration of $fontpath that either supercedes the one you specify or is appended on .. i'm not so sure
2007-02-22T14:56:00.000Z	unop	vlt	 let's have a look at your /etc/grep.conf .. use a !pastebin to show us
2007-02-22T14:59:00.000Z	vlt	unop	There are only the lines from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH?highlight=fontpath (| sed 's/\/X11\/fonts/\/fonts\/X11/g')
2007-02-22T15:00:00.000Z	unop	vlt	 i dunno, manually verify that the paths specified in $fontpath exist or that you provide symlink for those missing directories
2007-02-22T15:02:00.000Z	vlt	unop	symlinking did it.
2007-02-22T15:02:00.000Z	unop	vlt	:)
