2008-06-20T23:45:00.000Z	Rg12		ok jrib thanks
2008-06-20T23:46:00.000Z	Rg12		i ahve a strange problem with a Gigabyte Pci Wireless card (Atheros chipset, 5212 or 5213, i'm not sure); if i put it into the slot and i power up my pc, ubuntu freezes saying "loading hardware drivers"
2008-06-20T23:46:00.000Z	Rg12		if i power up the pc without the card, and on the grub screen i put the card into the slot, then boot ubuntu, it works!
2008-06-20T23:46:00.000Z	Rg12		i really don't know what to do
2008-06-20T23:46:00.000Z	chalcedony	Rg12	i'm sure thats frustrating.. have you checked with support for that card?
2008-06-20T23:46:00.000Z	Rg12		i'm not so newbie with unix system
2008-06-20T23:47:00.000Z	Rg12		support with gigabyte?
2008-06-20T23:47:00.000Z	Rg12		some kind of customer care?
2008-06-20T23:47:00.000Z	Rg12		i have thought about, i think that it could be some IRQ trouble
2008-06-20T23:47:00.000Z	Rg12		but...why it works if i put the card after grub?
2008-06-20T23:48:00.000Z	Rg12		sorry jrib
2008-06-20T23:48:00.000Z	Rg12		does anyone have some idea?
2008-06-20T23:49:00.000Z	Rg12		i've tried noapic nolapic noacpi ecc.. options on grub lines but it doesn't work
2008-06-20T23:49:00.000Z	Rg12		i've took a look on bugtrac of madwifi
2008-06-20T23:50:00.000Z	Rg12	chalcedony	no ideas?
2008-06-20T23:50:00.000Z	Rg12		yes, already trie
2008-06-20T23:50:00.000Z	Rg12		*tried
2008-06-20T23:51:00.000Z	Rg12		the worst thing is that i've bought this card lookin' at madwifi wiki that says "works out of the box"
2008-06-20T23:53:00.000Z	chalcedony	Rg12	i'm sorry, i'm good with google but not an expert with ubuntu
