2009-03-06T11:52:00.000Z	FrikkinLazer		I asked before, but didn't get a real answer, so here goes again: How do I update apt-file? 'sudo apt-file update' isn't working
2009-03-06T11:52:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	it's sudo apt-get update
2009-03-06T11:55:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	apt-file is an application to search for files in the Debian repository
2009-03-06T11:55:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	do a      sudo apt-get update  &&  sudo apt-file update
2009-03-06T11:56:00.000Z	FrikkinLazer	Scooma	sudo apt-get update works fine
2009-03-06T11:57:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	 and do a    sudo apt-get upgrade
2009-03-06T11:59:00.000Z	FrikkinLazer	Scooma	its updating now. Why doesnt sudo apt-get update not do a upgrade as well?
2009-03-06T12:00:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	 cos you're just updating the list of what's available so apt-get and synaptic can figure out if anything is new
2009-03-06T12:01:00.000Z	FrikkinLazer	Scooma	why does sudo apt-get upgrade upgrade firefox?
2009-03-06T12:03:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	until you become more experienced, it's best to just upgrade everything when you're told... later on you might need to hold back certain updates
2009-03-06T12:04:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	do you use apt-file a lot?
2009-03-06T12:06:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	okay so you don't need it. it's just to report on file versions of packages. don't worry - you don't need it. close that terminal window that it opened and then go into (from the top menu bar) System -> Administration -> synaptic package manager
2009-03-06T12:07:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	okay then do a search for apt-file
2009-03-06T12:07:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	so when you click on it, you should get a description below
2009-03-06T12:08:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	does it sound like something you need? I don't think so ;)
2009-03-06T12:08:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	anyway, right-click on the name "apt-file" in the top section and say "mark for removal"
2009-03-06T12:09:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	 you're starting out well on the ubuntu road :)
2009-03-06T12:10:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	another way to easily update your packages is through the Add/Remove choiceunder "applications"   but you have to close the Synaptic package manager first
2009-03-06T12:10:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	there's lots of games
2009-03-06T12:11:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	Kdevelop is, it's been around for quite a while... ultimately it depends on what you're using
2009-03-06T12:12:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	for instance monodevelop if you're a C# or VB/net person
2009-03-06T12:14:00.000Z	Scooma	FrikkinLazer	cheers
