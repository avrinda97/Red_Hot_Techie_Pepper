2006-08-13T09:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsa	 now ya know why i dont mess with XGL.    XGL support is in #ubuntu-xgl
2006-08-13T09:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsa	 yep. :P had similer issues.. xgl is a little messed up. in the 'how do i remove it dept.'
2006-08-13T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsa	 the xgl guys proberly know the correct way to remove it. I sure dont.
2006-08-13T09:49:00.000Z	munsa	Dr_Willis	- what do you suggest?
2006-08-13T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsa	 reread the docs for xgl.. reverse the steps.. if that dont work.. ask the xgl guys why their docs dont have a good  howto unstall feature. They may hafve a url that details the proper way to remove it.
2006-08-13T09:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsa	 its posslble you missed a step.
2006-08-13T09:50:00.000Z	munsa	Dr_Willis	yea thats what I did.
2006-08-13T09:50:00.000Z	munsa	Dr_Willis	I am in my gui now, but it is wacked out
2006-08-13T09:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsa	 now ya know why i tell everyone that xgl is a 'work in progress'
2006-08-13T09:51:00.000Z	munsa	Dr_Willis	yea, it actyally looked like it worked
2006-08-13T09:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsa	 i never have gotten it to work right.
2006-08-13T09:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsa	 then i tested out a live cd and saw all the nausa inducing special effects..
2006-08-13T09:52:00.000Z	munsa	Dr_Willis	which live CD I just wanted to see the cool effects
2006-08-13T09:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsa	 ive also seen several different install docs for it..  and some of them were vague. :P
2006-08-13T09:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsa	 koronna or somthing like that.
2006-08-13T09:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsa	 make a new user. see if it affects them as well.
