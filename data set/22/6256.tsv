2006-12-15T08:30:00.000Z	lambo4jos		hey everybody
2006-12-15T08:32:00.000Z	lambo4jos		has anyone had problems with the binary installation package of the mysql-query-browser on ubuntu dapper.  It installs fine, but I think the binary is broken cause it shuts down when I try to edit tables.  anyone know how to fix this?
2006-12-15T08:33:00.000Z	agent	lambo4jos	you may also try phpmyadmin -- mysql-query-broweser only lets you look at the query you create - phpmyadmin also has a query page that actually does something ;)
2006-12-15T08:34:00.000Z	lambo4jos	agent	can one edit tables and table data with phpmyadmin?
2006-12-15T08:34:00.000Z	agent	lambo4jos	yes
2006-12-15T08:35:00.000Z	agent	lambo4jos	except blobs :)
2006-12-15T08:35:00.000Z	lambo4jos	agent	is it 'sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin' ?
2006-12-15T08:35:00.000Z	agent	lambo4jos	probably
2006-12-15T08:36:00.000Z	lambo4jos	agent	what kind of configuring do i need to do to get this up and running?
2006-12-15T08:37:00.000Z	agent	lambo4jos	none... just make sure mysql and apache are running then localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser
2006-12-15T08:37:00.000Z	agent	lambo4jos	it may complain about blowfish but i noticed that doing a refresh takes care of that
2006-12-15T08:38:00.000Z	lambo4jos	agent	i haven't installed apache cause I havent' needed it yet, but does this require configuring to work with mysql?
2006-12-15T08:39:00.000Z	agent	lambo4jos	what are you trying to use mysql for?
2006-12-15T08:42:00.000Z	lambo4jos	agent	> ruby on rails on an ubuntu desktop at home and running webrick is all i need.
2006-12-15T08:42:00.000Z	agent	lambo4jos	so you want ruby + mysql, right?
2006-12-15T08:42:00.000Z	lambo4jos	agent	yes and i already have that working, but would like a gui tool to administer mysql
2006-12-15T08:44:00.000Z	agent	lambo4jos	never used a gui for mysql... have you looked at www.mysql.com? there is a community section with program names... mysql-query is not what you want
2006-12-15T08:44:00.000Z	lambo4jos	agent	i have also tried to install mysql-query-browser from source and couldn't get it working
2006-12-15T08:45:00.000Z	agent	lambo4jos	mysql-query-browser is not what you want... it just shows you queries from what i remember - and it works because i tried it a few days ago
2006-12-15T08:45:00.000Z	agent	lambo4jos	i tried it from the official ubuntu repositories (no sources)
2006-12-15T08:47:00.000Z	lambo4jos	agent	mine works fine too from 'sudo apt-get install mysql-query-browser'.  i can create a table but when I try to edit a table it shuts down.  no idea why.  any ideas?
2006-12-15T08:48:00.000Z	agent	lambo4jos	no ideas, sorry... run it from the terminal and see the output it gives when crashing
