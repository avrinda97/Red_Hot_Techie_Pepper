2009-07-27T17:01:00.000Z	mazda01_	Dr_Willis	how do you successfully save all your settings for all your programs and still do a clean install every 6 months?
2009-07-27T17:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mazda01_	 all the user settings are in their home directory. Other then  a few other files in /etc/ i dont have a lot of 'settings' for all my programs. to backup.
2009-07-27T17:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mazda01_	 i save the samba config.. and thats about it... what else do ya keep?
2009-07-27T17:04:00.000Z	mazda01_	Dr_Willis	sbackup.conf, updatedb.conf, and many others but I don't do a clean install every 6 months though so I can't remember what I all backup. I just backup everything with sbackup besides /proc/ and like 5 other directories.
2009-07-27T17:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mazda01_	 i dont recall ever altering much in /etc/ other then the samba config.
2009-07-27T17:06:00.000Z	mazda01_	Dr_Willis	I use opendns, because my router doesn't properly forward dns requests
2009-07-27T17:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mazda01_	 i found a 1.5tb on sale for $110
2009-07-27T17:14:00.000Z	mazda01_	Dr_Willis	where at?
2009-07-27T17:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mazda01_	 frys, on a holiday special
2009-07-27T17:14:00.000Z	mazda01_	Dr_Willis	NICE DEAL.
2009-07-27T17:16:00.000Z	mazda01_	Dr_Willis	ubuntuone service, online storage? cool. they want to be like apple with their mobleme
2009-07-27T17:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mazda01_	 saw it  mentioned in the release notes for the next release. :) apple has sort of downplated that feature also it seems...
2009-07-27T17:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mazda01_	 its a neat idea.. and handy.. just need to get more standardized. and cheaper!
2009-07-27T17:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mazda01_	 ive seen some live cd that have a 'persistant save' over the network feature also.  (in testing)
2009-07-27T17:18:00.000Z	mazda01_	Dr_Willis	agreed. I do use mobileme because I have an iphone, so I want to make sure my 1500 contacts, memos, calander are backed up besides on my computer. it does it all via push, very nice feature. I paid $99 (us) for the year for that feature though
2009-07-27T17:18:00.000Z	mazda01_	Dr_Willis	i never had much luck with livecd's. how much ram do you need for the livecd's to be not noticable speed slowness. bad wording i know
2009-07-27T17:18:00.000Z	mazda01_	Dr_Willis	ha. ha ha ha
2009-07-27T17:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mazda01_	 depends on the live cd.. 512mb min i would suggest. i always make a swap partition on every hd on eveyr system.. just incase I use a live cd on them
2009-07-27T17:20:00.000Z	mazda01_	Dr_Willis	WOW, no way. I have used a live cd on my mahcine with 1.5gb of ram and it was noticably slow. how can you make a livecd use a swap partition? I'll have to look that up sometime. i thought the whole thing with a livecd was so that you didn't haev to modify the machine at all.
2009-07-27T17:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mazda01_	 most live cds see/use a swap partition if one exists.
2009-07-27T17:21:00.000Z	mazda01_	Dr_Willis	oh, ok.
2009-07-27T17:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mazda01_	 with 1.5gb of ram.. many live cd's have a 'toram' option where they run totally from ram.
