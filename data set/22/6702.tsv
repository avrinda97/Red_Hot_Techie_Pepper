2006-08-17T09:07:00.000Z	Y4llow		I need a hand setting up mp3's to play, i know this si a common question but everything I've tried doesnt work.
2006-08-17T09:08:00.000Z	AshDragonScale	Y4llow	What is it doing?
2006-08-17T09:11:00.000Z	Y4llow	AshDragonScale	It says "The file is not an audio stream"
2006-08-17T09:14:00.000Z	AshDragonScale	Y4llow	sudu apt-get install xmms
2006-08-17T09:18:00.000Z	AshDragonScale	Y4llow	did that do it for you?
2006-08-17T09:38:00.000Z	Y4llow	AshDragonScale	That did not work, it said the package has no installation candidate. It's not connected to the net btw.
2006-08-17T09:40:00.000Z	AshDragonScale	Y4llow	ok so look in you System > Administration > synaptic... load that up and search for mpg123
2006-08-17T09:41:00.000Z	Y4llow	AshDragonScale	it didn't find anything
2006-08-17T09:42:00.000Z	AshDragonScale	Y4llow	you said it is not connected to the internet?...
2006-08-17T09:42:00.000Z	Y4llow	AshDragonScale	no internet connection
2006-08-17T09:43:00.000Z	AshDragonScale	Y4llow	give me a few
2006-08-17T09:43:00.000Z	Y4llow	AshDragonScale	Ok, thanks
2006-08-17T09:52:00.000Z	AshDragonScale	Y4llow	see if you can find mpg321
2006-08-17T09:54:00.000Z	Y4llow	AshDragonScale	Nope, I had a look and theres nothing starting with mpg. Also I'm using Breezy Badger if that makes a difference.
2006-08-17T09:54:00.000Z	AshDragonScale	Y4llow	try gstreamer0.8-mad
2006-08-17T09:56:00.000Z	Y4llow	AshDragonScale	Theres no mad plugin there.
2006-08-17T09:57:00.000Z	AshDragonScale	Y4llow	 well... because there is not internet connection to the box it is going to take a bit.
2006-08-17T09:58:00.000Z	Y4llow	AshDragonScale	Heh, I figured that much. I've only got wireless broadband and I can't get that going either.
2006-08-17T10:00:00.000Z	Y4llow	AshDragonScale	If it's going to be to much trouble I'll work on my connection first, as I need that aswell. Thankyou for the help!
2006-08-17T10:01:00.000Z	AshDragonScale	Y4llow	well, do a google search for mpg321 on the box you are using and download it, you may have to manually download and install the dependencies too
2006-08-17T10:02:00.000Z	Y4llow	AshDragonScale	That's probably what I've been trying to do up until now. I've only just started with Linux so I get stuck with the installing bit.
2006-08-17T10:05:00.000Z	AshDragonScale	Y4llow	 yes to access the universe you will have to be online
