2009-06-28T10:49:00.000Z	Double_Kill2		can anyone help me install a screencam software such as hypercam/camistia on ubuntu linux?
2009-06-28T10:51:00.000Z	Jacobian_	Double_Kill2	Are there any screencam programs in the Add/Remove Software?
2009-06-28T10:51:00.000Z	Double_Kill2	Jacobian_	I will look
2009-06-28T10:51:00.000Z	Jacobian_	Double_Kill2	There are more programs in Synaptic, if you know in advance what you'll need.
2009-06-28T10:51:00.000Z	Double_Kill2	Jacobian_	i'm not sure if there is any out there for linux
2009-06-28T10:52:00.000Z	Double_Kill2	Jacobian_	i was hoping someone in here would know
2009-06-28T10:52:00.000Z	Jacobian_	Double_Kill2	So what will the screencam do? It's not a webcam, is it? Is it a screen recorder?
2009-06-28T10:52:00.000Z	Jacobian_	Double_Kill2	Perhaps we can find what you need
2009-06-28T10:52:00.000Z	Double_Kill2	Jacobian_	yes, such as hypercam
2009-06-28T10:52:00.000Z	Double_Kill2	Jacobian_	it records your screen into a video format
2009-06-28T10:52:00.000Z	Jacobian_	Double_Kill2	Mmm, I see
2009-06-28T10:52:00.000Z	Jacobian_	Double_Kill2	I know I've seen a good program for this
2009-06-28T10:53:00.000Z	Jacobian_	Double_Kill2	I'm trying to find it
2009-06-28T10:54:00.000Z	Double_Kill2	Jacobian_	i found this one called Xvidcap. but all the downloads are in i386 architechture
2009-06-28T10:54:00.000Z	Double_Kill2	Jacobian_	i need the lower one
2009-06-28T10:54:00.000Z	Double_Kill2	Jacobian_	i am running a 32 bit OS
2009-06-28T10:54:00.000Z	Jacobian_	Double_Kill2	You need this for x86, 32 bit? Is that right?
2009-06-28T10:55:00.000Z	Double_Kill2	Jacobian_	32bit
2009-06-28T10:56:00.000Z	Jacobian_	Double_Kill2	Well, here is something: http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Apps/screen-capture.html Are any of these similar to what you need?
