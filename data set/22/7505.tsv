2006-03-17T16:28:00.000Z	Whatsisname		k3b would be awesome if they'd have two things changed/added
2006-03-17T16:28:00.000Z	Whatsisname		xcdroast is ass
2006-03-17T16:28:00.000Z	Whatsisname		if k3b was made "g3b" and if it supported simultaneous burning or multiple recorders
2006-03-17T16:30:00.000Z	Whatsisname		looks like gnomebaker is similar to k3b, in that it is simply a frontend for cdrecord / mkisofs / etc
2006-03-17T16:30:00.000Z	intelikey	Whatsisname	all of them are
2006-03-17T16:30:00.000Z	Whatsisname	intelikey	well, you can use cdrecord then, k3b is basically just drag+drop front end for it
2006-03-17T16:31:00.000Z	intelikey	Whatsisname	yup

2006-03-17T16:44:00.000Z	intelikey	Whatsisname	doesn't matter you bet and you said you pay when you bet.  :)
2006-03-17T16:45:00.000Z	Whatsisname	intelikey	it's usually understood to mean that you only pay when you lose
