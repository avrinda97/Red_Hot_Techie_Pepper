2011-12-19T21:13:00.000Z	Dl145		Hello, I've installed Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS on a DL145 Server from an USB stick, the installation process goes through fine, but now when I try and boot, it just shows BIOS info etc etc and then gets to a black screen with a blinking cursor.
2011-12-19T21:15:00.000Z	sskalnik	Dl145	 If you use Ctrl + F2, do you get a terminal?
2011-12-19T21:16:00.000Z	Dl145	sskalnik	no i dont.. I suspect there is a problem with grub, pressing shift during startup doesnt do anything either
2011-12-19T21:22:00.000Z	sskalnik	Dl145	 Checked the install image and HDD for errors? Also, if you boot to a live environment, what can you determine about the installed OS?
2011-12-19T21:31:00.000Z	Dl145	sskalnik	yes, the md5 sum is correct.. so is the hdd..
2011-12-19T22:02:00.000Z	Dl145	sskalnik	Im during the installation process again, it gets to where I can create partitions etc.. the drive on which I want to create the partition for ubuntu server is called "SDB" and the USB Flash Drive is SDA.. Does this do a difference?
2011-12-19T22:04:00.000Z	sskalnik	Dl145	 That is kinda of odd, but shouldn't break the system. Confirm that the installer installs to the HDD and not the USB?
2011-12-19T22:05:00.000Z	Dl145	sskalnik	That's confirmed.. I did a manually partitioning..
2011-12-19T22:06:00.000Z	Dl145	sskalnik	the setup looks similar to this: http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=203602&d=1317836480
2011-12-19T22:07:00.000Z	Dl145	sskalnik	except it says: SCSCI 6 SDB
2011-12-19T22:07:00.000Z	sskalnik	Dl145	 Is this in vbox or on a real machine?
2011-12-19T22:08:00.000Z	Dl145	sskalnik	it is a real machine.. HP ProLiant DL145 Server
2011-12-19T22:12:00.000Z	sskalnik	Dl145	 Just to rule out the basics; Ctrl + F2/3/4/5/etc. get no shell, and the USB drive is disconnected, and Shift on boot does not get you a GRUB menu, and you are sure the BIOS boots to the right drive?
2011-12-19T22:14:00.000Z	Dl145	sskalnik	Youre correct. yea im quite sure..
2011-12-19T22:14:00.000Z	sskalnik	Dl145	 If you get no shell and Shift doesn't work, it sounds like you are GRUB-less.
2011-12-19T22:14:00.000Z	Dl145	sskalnik	thats what I though.. does it have anything to do that the USB is called SDA and the Drive is called SDB
2011-12-19T22:15:00.000Z	sskalnik	Dl145	 It is within the realm of possibility that GRUB was installed to the wrong drive.
2011-12-19T22:16:00.000Z	Dl145	sskalnik	yea, but would it work when im installing on sdb instead of sda?
2011-12-19T22:16:00.000Z	sskalnik	Dl145	 If GRUB somehow ended up on SDA instead of SDB, then if SDA is plugged in, it should boot
2011-12-19T22:17:00.000Z	sskalnik	Dl145	 That said, I would boot a live image and see where GRUB was installed
2011-12-19T22:17:00.000Z	Dl145	sskalnik	i will give it one more try..then i will try with a live image..
2011-12-19T22:17:00.000Z	sskalnik	Dl145	 sounds good
