2008-05-11T10:23:00.000Z	consumismo_owns	zChris	I never used any linux.. today I install one fresh new HD in my computer, run the ubuntu live cd 8.0.4, click in 'install' button from desktop, I just follow the steps of wizard to install, after done I restart the system and now I receive this message in black screen: "Master Boot Record Error". I'm not able to fix it, I never used Linux.
2008-05-11T10:23:00.000Z	zChris	consumismo_owns	but how can you use VNC when it dosent boot u p?
2008-05-11T10:24:00.000Z	consumismo_owns	zChris	with live cd
2008-05-11T10:24:00.000Z	zChris	consumismo_owns	how are your hds ordered?
2008-05-11T10:25:00.000Z	consumismo_owns	zChris	I'm on other HD now with windows... I will remove this hd, and put the other with linux.. run the live cd, activate the vnc and send ip for you access it
2008-05-11T10:26:00.000Z	zChris	consumismo_owns	so you only have one 1 hd connected at all time?
2008-05-11T10:28:00.000Z	consumismo_owns	zChris	yes two hd, but I want connect only one per time to install the SO, after this I will connect both hd'd and manage the boot with the "F8" feature of my motherboard
2008-05-11T10:29:00.000Z	zChris	consumismo_owns	dont try to boot from linux with both hardrives connected
2008-05-11T10:30:00.000Z	consumismo_owns	zChris	yes, I use only one hd.. I plug this hd with windows now only to get help here, I always try boot the linux only with 1 hd
2008-05-11T10:30:00.000Z	zChris	consumismo_owns	reinstall linux with both hds connected
2008-05-11T10:32:00.000Z	consumismo_owns	zChris	this is my second attempt, I can't intall with both hds connected because I dont want no one boot loader manage like grub or lilo to manage my windows hd (show menu to choose SO to start)
2008-05-11T10:33:00.000Z	zChris	consumismo_owns	hmm, does you get that master boot record when you ONLY boot from your linux hardrive? And dont have windows hardrive connected ?
