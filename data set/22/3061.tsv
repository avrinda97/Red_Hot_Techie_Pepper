2008-12-21T08:35:00.000Z	mwhit74		i am trying to create an unbuntu cd so i can update my version, i have the iso downloaded but i can't get it to write to the cd in my try any suggestions
2008-12-21T08:35:00.000Z	white-sheep	mwhit74	-- You're using Ubuntu?
2008-12-21T08:36:00.000Z	mwhit74	white-sheep	yes
2008-12-21T08:36:00.000Z	white-sheep	mwhit74	--- Right-click on the ISO -- It should prompt Burn using <> Creator.  Something like that.
2008-12-21T08:38:00.000Z	mwhit74	white-sheep	yea i tried that, i im not sure if the disk drive is mounting
2008-12-21T08:39:00.000Z	white-sheep	mwhit74	-- What do you mean?  When you burned the disc, and it's still in tray -- It'll show up on your Desktop.
2008-12-21T08:40:00.000Z	mwhit74	white-sheep	that would be the problem i have no disk on my desktop showing that it mounted
2008-12-21T08:40:00.000Z	white-sheep	mwhit74	-- Open the tray and close it again.  You might unmount it already.
2008-12-21T08:40:00.000Z	mwhit74	white-sheep	trying that now
2008-12-21T08:41:00.000Z	mwhit74	white-sheep	cd sounded like it was booting up then quit after about 10 secs
2008-12-21T08:41:00.000Z	mwhit74	white-sheep	maybe my drive is just f-ed
2008-12-21T08:42:00.000Z	white-sheep	mwhit74	-- Sorry to hear that -- What were you trying to do?  Update, you said?  You can just do it right there.
2008-12-21T08:42:00.000Z	mwhit74	white-sheep	yea, but i have heard/read it was better to uninstall and reinstall
2008-12-21T08:42:00.000Z	mwhit74	white-sheep	what's your opinion?
2008-12-21T08:43:00.000Z	white-sheep	mwhit74	-- Uninstall and reinstall?  This is not Windows. >_>
2008-12-21T08:46:00.000Z	mwhit74	white-sheep	well like install the newer version over the top of the old one
2008-12-21T08:47:00.000Z	white-sheep	mwhit74	-- I suppose you can update but I think it's better that you reinstall it when the latest release came out -- I think you'll just get about same thing -- but you'll lose your setting unless you back up your data.
2008-12-21T08:50:00.000Z	mwhit74	white-sheep	well how do i reinstall then?
2008-12-21T08:51:00.000Z	white-sheep	mwhit74	-- You could add repos or try a new CD.  Did the dialog say the disc was burned 100%?
2008-12-21T08:52:00.000Z	mwhit74	white-sheep	but i the dialog box appeared almost instantly after i told it to write the cd and it said it was a 100% done
2008-12-21T08:53:00.000Z	white-sheep	mwhit74	-- See md5sum above.
2008-12-21T08:53:00.000Z	white-sheep	mwhit74	-- Your download may be corrupted.
