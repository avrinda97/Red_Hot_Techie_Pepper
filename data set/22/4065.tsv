2008-04-06T13:51:00.000Z	Gnea	kelvin911	so go find it
2008-04-06T13:51:00.000Z	kelvin911	Gnea	is there a way to download it?
2008-04-06T13:51:00.000Z	Gnea	kelvin911	yes.
2008-04-06T13:51:00.000Z	kelvin911	Gnea	where?
2008-04-06T13:51:00.000Z	Gnea	kelvin911	that information is considered off-topic. google.com is the best place to start, though.
2008-04-06T13:52:00.000Z	kelvin911	Gnea	i never use vmware
2008-04-06T13:52:00.000Z	kelvin911	Gnea	 can u run xp in vmware?
2008-04-06T13:52:00.000Z	Gnea	kelvin911	yes.
2008-04-06T13:52:00.000Z	kelvin911	Gnea	how good?
2008-04-06T13:52:00.000Z	kelvin911	Gnea	can u play games thru it?
2008-04-06T13:52:00.000Z	Gnea	kelvin911	very good. yes.
2008-04-06T13:52:00.000Z	kelvin911	Gnea	so how does vmware work?
2008-04-06T13:53:00.000Z	kelvin911	Gnea	install it and it will run the winxp i have on my C:\?
2008-04-06T13:53:00.000Z	Gnea	kelvin911	you install it, run it, create a virtual disk and use real or virtual hardware to interface with it - basically it's a whole computer running on your desktop
2008-04-06T13:54:00.000Z	Gnea	kelvin911	your best bet there is to visit vmware.com and ask in #vmware
2008-04-06T13:54:00.000Z	kelvin911	Gnea	so basically u cant run games on vmware
2008-04-06T14:01:00.000Z	Gnea	kelvin911	i've found that it's better to create a virtual disk instead of using a physical one.
