2005-09-22T11:56:00.000Z	MrFaber		The problem with powernowd is known
2005-09-22T11:58:00.000Z	MrFaber		If I try to remove powernowd Synaptic wants to remove ubuntu-desktop too
2005-09-22T11:58:00.000Z	MrFaber		is it ok?
2005-09-22T11:59:00.000Z	onkarshinde	MrFaber	ubuntu-desktop is a meta package that is dependent on all the packages that are installed by default
2005-09-22T12:01:00.000Z	onkarshinde	MrFaber	ubuntu-desktop may help you when you upgrade Ubuntu next. I will install some packages that are to be installed by default in new version but not present in current version.
2005-09-22T12:04:00.000Z	MrFaber	onkarshinde	thanks
2005-09-22T12:04:00.000Z	MrFaber	onkarshinde	how can I add powernowd init script like default
2005-09-22T12:06:00.000Z	onkarshinde	MrFaber	I have no idea
2005-09-22T12:43:00.000Z	onkarshinde	MrFaber	install totem-xine
2005-09-22T12:44:00.000Z	MrFaber	onkarshinde	thanks but I am happy with vlc just was curious that there was no packet
2005-09-22T12:48:00.000Z	onkarshinde	MrFaber	May be because they are not stripped on Gentoo. See man strip
2005-09-22T12:51:00.000Z	onkarshinde	MrFaber	For ubuntu, System->Preferences->Prefered Applications
2005-09-22T12:51:00.000Z	MrFaber	onkarshinde	I have found this but this is for terminal, mail and ww only
2005-09-22T12:51:00.000Z	onkarshinde	MrFaber	Do you want for DVD?
2005-09-22T12:52:00.000Z	MrFaber	onkarshinde	yes use vlc instead of totem
2005-09-22T12:53:00.000Z	onkarshinde	MrFaber	System->Preferences->Removable drives and media preferences
2005-09-22T12:53:00.000Z	MrFaber	onkarshinde	you are so fast, many thanks :)

2005-09-22T13:12:00.000Z	onkarshinde	MrFaber	No idea. It was easy in RedHat to do that. I don't know how to do in Ubuntu.
