2007-12-21T06:40:00.000Z	gvsa123		if i download and install unrar from synaptics, it doesn't add an additional program right? it justs adds to ubuntu's default archive manager, the ability to handle rar files?
2007-12-21T06:40:00.000Z	musikgoat	gvsa123	it installs unrar
2007-12-21T06:40:00.000Z	musikgoat	gvsa123	which works with ubuntu's archive manager
2007-12-21T06:41:00.000Z	gvsa123	musikgoat	then i can simply right click on a rar file and choose open with archive manager and it'll work just like any other archive
2007-12-21T06:41:00.000Z	musikgoat	gvsa123	yes
2007-12-21T06:42:00.000Z	gvsa123	musikgoat	thanks
2007-12-21T06:43:00.000Z	gvsa123	musikgoat	so which is better? the free or non-free of unrar?
2007-12-21T06:45:00.000Z	gvsa123	musikgoat	i see...
2007-12-21T06:47:00.000Z	musikgoat	gvsa123	alot of people fight about whats better, rar compression or 7lza or whatever it is
2007-12-21T06:49:00.000Z	musikgoat	gvsa123	yeah tar.gz is common
2007-12-21T06:49:00.000Z	musikgoat	gvsa123	tar creates on long file, and gzip or bzip2 are the popular linux compression formats
2007-12-21T06:50:00.000Z	gvsa123	musikgoat	oh they;'re different format altogether
2007-12-21T06:50:00.000Z	musikgoat	gvsa123	tar is separate from compressing, don't get them confused
2007-12-21T06:50:00.000Z	gvsa123	musikgoat	oh tar doesn't compress?
2007-12-21T06:51:00.000Z	gvsa123	musikgoat	i see...
2007-12-21T06:51:00.000Z	musikgoat	gvsa123	 the .extention  is just an extention... so you will see   filename.tar.gz  and you will see filename.tgz  which are the same
2007-12-21T06:59:00.000Z	musikgoat	gvsa123	did you try the nonfree version?
2007-12-21T06:59:00.000Z	gvsa123	musikgoat	not yet. this is not normal?
2007-12-21T07:00:00.000Z	gvsa123	musikgoat	oh there.... i needed the nonfree... hmmm... i wonder why
2007-12-21T07:00:00.000Z	musikgoat	gvsa123	try just installing unrar   not unrar-free
2007-12-21T07:01:00.000Z	musikgoat	gvsa123	I'm not too sure why
2007-12-21T07:01:00.000Z	gvsa123	musikgoat	oh well... whichever works... :)
