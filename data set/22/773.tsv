2011-03-21T21:17:00.000Z	b1lly		i'm having trouble with my video settings, it keeps triggering an error when i try to set my visual effects -> anything above "none".
2011-03-21T21:17:00.000Z	b1lly		also, it's not detecting my second monitor
2011-03-21T21:18:00.000Z	b1lly		when I choose a different type of visual effects it does a searching for available drivers...and than reloads the screen and triggers an "desktop effects could not be enabled" error
2011-03-21T21:19:00.000Z	b1lly		dvi
2011-03-21T21:20:00.000Z	b1lly		so the cable is a hdmi to dvi conversion, the screen supports dvi, the laptop supports hdmi
2011-03-21T21:20:00.000Z	b1lly		it might be vga, whats the newer one?
2011-03-21T21:20:00.000Z	b1lly		dvi is the newer one, im pretty sure its dvi
2011-03-21T21:21:00.000Z	b1lly		im new to ubuntu jt so, I don't think so?
2011-03-21T21:21:00.000Z	b1lly		oh, yes I did
2011-03-21T21:21:00.000Z	b1lly		and once I installed the proprietary drivers it started giving me the visual effects error
2011-03-21T21:22:00.000Z	Scunizi	b1lly	because you probably did it wrong.. did you download from nvidia and install using a web based tutorial?
2011-03-21T21:22:00.000Z	b1lly	Scunizi	i used ubuntu to install
2011-03-21T21:22:00.000Z	b1lly	Scunizi	i went to system > admin > additional drivers
2011-03-21T21:23:00.000Z	b1lly		and it installed it automatically
2011-03-21T21:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	b1lly	what card do you have?
2011-03-21T21:23:00.000Z	b1lly		thats a good question, its a laptop, i know its an nvidea i just forget the model
2011-03-21T21:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	b1lly	sudo lshw will list all your hardware.. type that into a terminal.. then with the output look for reference to it.
2011-03-21T21:24:00.000Z	b1lly		when i try to go into my nvidia settings its saying "Youd o not appear to be using the nvidia x driver. please edit your x configuration file (run nvidia-xconfig) as root and restart he server
2011-03-21T21:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	b1lly	ok.. then open a terminal and type "sudo nvidia-xconfig" without the quotes.
2011-03-21T21:25:00.000Z	b1lly		done
2011-03-21T21:25:00.000Z	b1lly		imma restart pc quick
2011-03-21T21:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	b1lly	k
