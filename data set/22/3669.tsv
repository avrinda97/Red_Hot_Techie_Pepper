2009-06-02T02:25:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Slart	np
2009-06-03T02:16:00.000Z	Slart	Xodiac13	how much memory do you have? >=4GB, go with 64bit  <4GB, go with 32bit
2009-06-03T02:17:00.000Z	Slart	Xodiac13	then go with 64bit.. the memory and a small increase in speed when it comes to certain software is kind of the only difference
2009-06-03T02:18:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Slart	do i still get the same software and and stuff as the 32 bit
2009-06-03T02:18:00.000Z	Slart	Xodiac13	yup
2009-06-03T02:18:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Slart	nice
2009-07-19T12:42:00.000Z	Slart	Xodiac13	right click on the menu icon.. there should be a "edit menu" option
2009-07-19T12:43:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Slart	thank you and i also have uninstalled the game and it left a folder behind it wont let me delete that
2009-07-19T12:45:00.000Z	Slart	Xodiac13	if you can't delete the folder using the normal ways it might be owned by root.. you can use sudo in a terminal... or use "gksudo nautilus" to get a root file explorer window thingy... but please be very careful with that window.. things can go very bad very quickly
2009-07-19T12:48:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Slart	i cant get into the filesystem in terminal
2009-07-19T12:49:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Slart	i just want to delete the folder the game i installed then uninstalled it it wont let me delete the folder
2009-07-19T12:49:00.000Z	Slart	Xodiac13	then do the gksudo nautilus thing... but be careful
2009-07-19T12:49:00.000Z	Xodiac13	Slart	should i just leave it then
