2010-11-27T09:05:00.000Z	nimbiotics	FrozenFire	sry. Im desperate, been trying for 2 days already
2010-11-27T09:05:00.000Z	FrozenFire	nimbiotics	And I'd be happy to help. You just have to elaborate further on the issue.
2010-11-27T09:10:00.000Z	nimbiotics	FrozenFire	Im a noob, dont know what to tell you. I ve got a smal home LAN, one win pc and ubuntu on the other one. Have shares on the win pc and i cant even see the pc on nautilus. OTH I shared a folder using gadmin-samba and another one from nautilus and, again; I cannot se the linux pc on windows. Purdeg samba, deleted smb.conf and reinstalled. same thing. gadmin-samab keeps giving me...
2010-11-27T09:11:00.000Z	FrozenFire	nimbiotics	That really sounds like a networking problem. Check the IP address of each system and tell me them.
2010-11-27T09:12:00.000Z	nimbiotics	FrozenFire	First of all, I must tell you that im using DHCP on my router, could that be an issue?
2010-11-27T09:13:00.000Z	FrozenFire	nimbiotics	DHCP isn't really an issue at all.
2010-11-27T09:13:00.000Z	FrozenFire	nimbiotics	What I'm looking for is the possibility that your systems are within two different subnets.
2010-11-27T09:13:00.000Z	nimbiotics	FrozenFire	linux pc: 192.168.1.101 //  win pc: 192.168.1.102
2010-11-27T09:14:00.000Z	FrozenFire	nimbiotics	Alright, so the systems are indeed on the same subnet. That's good.
2010-11-27T09:14:00.000Z	FrozenFire	nimbiotics	Are you running a firewall on either system?
2010-11-27T09:14:00.000Z	FrozenFire	nimbiotics	*Especially* the Windows system.
2010-11-27T09:15:00.000Z	FrozenFire	nimbiotics	http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc787076%28WS.10%29.aspx There's how to enable file sharing through Windows Firewall, which you may have enabled.
2010-11-27T09:16:00.000Z	nimbiotics	FrozenFire	on both, but taka a look at he "Handle connections on" setting I'm geting from gadmin-samba:  127.0.0.1/8 192.168.0.1/24
2010-11-27T09:16:00.000Z	FrozenFire	nimbiotics	Well... yeah, that would be a problem.
2010-11-27T09:20:00.000Z	nimbiotics	FrozenFire	what should this value be? The "Allowed hosts and networks" value does look weird to me also:  127. 192.168.1 , as well as "Anounce this server to:": 192.168.0.255 and Retreive announcements from": 192.168.0.255
2010-11-27T09:21:00.000Z	FrozenFire	nimbiotics	Honestly, I've never had to mess with gadmin-samba
2010-11-27T09:22:00.000Z	FrozenFire	nimbiotics	Have you read the Samba guide (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Samba)?
2010-11-27T09:22:00.000Z	nimbiotics	FrozenFire	im doing this for the second time on same pc's, now with new OSs installed; but first time was a reall pain in the butt too
2010-11-27T09:24:00.000Z	nimbiotics	FrozenFire	'ive read the guide. PCs are xp and ubuntu and neither one can see the other
2010-11-27T09:25:00.000Z	nimbiotics	FrozenFire	(reading win link)
