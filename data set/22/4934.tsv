2007-09-05T12:02:00.000Z	slicks_mage	Jordan_U	can u help me out when your done helping Evanlec?
2007-09-05T12:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	Ask your question and if anyone can help they will
2007-09-05T12:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	Why aren't you using Gaim?
2007-09-05T12:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	Do you know the chipset of your card?
2007-09-05T12:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	lspci, or System -> Preferences -> Hardware Information
2007-09-05T12:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	BCM4318 is still unstable with bcm43xx drivers :(
2007-09-05T12:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	You can try fwcutter anyway though
2007-09-05T12:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	for fwcutter just sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter
2007-09-05T12:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	But try fwcutter anyways, it can't hurt anything and doesn't conflict with ndiswrapper ( though ndiswrapper conflicts with it )
2007-09-05T12:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	What error? When?
2007-09-05T12:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	Try it again, I just installed it and it worked
2007-09-05T12:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter
2007-09-05T12:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	Reboot or run "sudo modprobe bcm43xx"
2007-09-05T12:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	Then you should see light on your card
2007-09-05T12:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	Did you remove bcm43xx ?
2007-09-05T12:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	I mean earlier, any time since you installed Ubuntu
2007-09-05T12:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	Probably no need, see if you have all the default packages by installing the "ubuntu-desktop" package
2007-09-05T12:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	Yes
2007-09-05T12:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	Wait, did you run "sudo modprobe bcm43xx" or did you only have one x ?
2007-09-05T12:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	Wait, did you run "sudo modprobe bcm43xx" or did you only have one x ?
2007-09-05T12:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	Yes
2007-09-05T12:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slicks_mage	Strange, either try rebooting or just use the forum post for ndiswrapper
