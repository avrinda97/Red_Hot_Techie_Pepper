2006-07-19T13:11:00.000Z	user-land		thanks a lot, solid_liq :-)
2006-07-19T09:01:00.000Z	user-land		Hello, i changed my graphics card from a cheap ATI to a better Nvidia, do i need to reinstall Ubuntu ?
2006-07-19T09:01:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	No way. Just reconfigure X
2006-07-19T09:01:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg (It may be done automatically anyway, but with the Free driver)
2006-07-19T09:02:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	That page tells you how to install 3D nvidia driver
2006-07-19T09:04:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	Why reboot?
2006-07-19T09:04:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	Ah, OK :)
2006-07-19T09:30:00.000Z	user-land	Warbo	reconfiguring x worked well, but after the first minute watching a video the signal from the card went dead ...
2006-07-19T09:31:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	Are you on the free drivers or the non-free ones?
2006-07-19T09:33:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	I usually find that I have more problems with the non-free driver (called "nvidia") then the free one. Either way, try the ohter
2006-07-19T14:30:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	You can specify it's width in the preferences (right click the titlebar)
2006-07-21T15:42:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	I think it it bluez-passwd or something. Try using "ls /usr/bin/*blue*" to see the bluetooth commands
2006-07-21T15:43:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	I must say that KDE's handling of bluetooth is far better than GNOME's
2006-07-21T15:43:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	Install gnome-bluetooth
2006-07-21T15:46:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	I wouldn't think so, but kubuntu-desktop installs A LOT of stuff. I make do with Konqueror to do my OBEX file transfers, and I think I set up the PIN with bluez-pin (I think you have to put it in the config file somewhere in /etc)
2006-07-21T15:55:00.000Z	user-land	Warbo	are you getting something in return for your excellent support work here ?
2006-07-21T15:56:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	I am getting a warm, happy glow
2006-07-21T15:56:00.000Z	user-land	Warbo	isn't that frustrating ?
2006-07-21T15:56:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	Getting a happy glow? Well, it can attract moths at night...
2006-07-21T15:58:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	I use GNOME, but I use Konqueror for Bluetooth
2006-07-21T16:01:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	I like the look of it. Not so much the new shiny themes, so I reverted to a matte XFCE theme and E16 as the window manager
2006-07-21T16:02:00.000Z	Warbo	user-land	Whatever floats your boat
