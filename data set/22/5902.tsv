2007-05-17T11:52:00.000Z	vladuz976	r00tintheb0x	shouldn't fetchmail documentation mention that option?
2007-05-17T11:52:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	vladuz976	probably... but i didnt even have to type to find that answer.
2007-05-17T11:53:00.000Z	vladuz976	r00tintheb0x	i don't actually see an stls command issued on that page
2007-05-17T11:54:00.000Z	vladuz976	r00tintheb0x	only talks about sslcheck
2007-05-17T11:54:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	vladuz976	hold on

2007-05-17T11:59:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	vladuz976	http://pastebin.ca/raw/492470

2007-05-17T12:09:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	vladuz976	you're going to have to do some research on how to use the command properly.
2007-05-17T12:10:00.000Z	vladuz976	r00tintheb0x	now that is a better answer than laughing at me, if you don't want to tell me
2007-05-17T12:10:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	vladuz976	its not that i dont want to tell you. I wouldn't be able to teach you that much over the internet in my alotted tim,e.
