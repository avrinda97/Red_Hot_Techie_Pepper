2010-04-13T03:07:00.000Z	Guthur		I'm trying to use mysql on a remote server but keep getting access denied for user, I have tried resetting the passwords but still the same, I'm doing this through ssh
2010-04-13T03:07:00.000Z	Guthur		Anyone had similar before
2010-04-13T03:08:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Guthur	do you want to connect remotly to mysql-server?
2010-04-13T03:08:00.000Z	Guthur	zaxonspox	I'm just trying to connect locally at the moment, on the server
2010-04-13T03:10:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Guthur	remote by vnc, and then locally by terminal to mysql?
2010-04-13T03:12:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Guthur	do you type sudo mysql -u root -p <enter> and typing pass?
2010-04-13T03:12:00.000Z	Guthur	zaxonspox	I am logged in as root
2010-04-13T03:13:00.000Z	Guthur	zaxonspox	and thats exactly what I have tried, I have even went through the password reset procedure, I'm a little stumped
2010-04-13T03:13:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Guthur	ok, then without sudo, the rest is the same?
2010-04-13T03:13:00.000Z	Guthur	zaxonspox	I just get -> ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)
2010-04-13T03:14:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Guthur	is the password correct?
2010-04-13T03:14:00.000Z	Guthur	zaxonspox	I pretty sure it is, it is the one in the reset file
2010-04-13T03:15:00.000Z	Guthur	zaxonspox	I'm as sure as I can be I suppose
2010-04-13T03:17:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Guthur	it looks like wrong pass, can you connect thru VNC?
2010-04-13T03:17:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Guthur	VNC instead of SSH
2010-04-13T03:18:00.000Z	Guthur	zaxonspox	I'll check it out, I haven't tried VNC before
2010-04-13T03:19:00.000Z	Guthur	zaxonspox	No physical access, it is a VPS
2010-04-13T03:19:00.000Z	Guthur	zaxonspox	I have full root privileges is all
2010-04-13T03:20:00.000Z	Guthur	zaxonspox	I should technically be able to reboot the VM as but that doesn't seem to be working at the moment
2010-04-13T03:22:00.000Z	Guthur	zaxonspox	Yep, the only time I can access is when the i set --skip-grant-tables on the daemon
2010-04-13T03:30:00.000Z	Guthur	zaxonspox	Do you know if tightvnc requires X
2010-04-13T03:30:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Guthur	yyy, yes, i think so
