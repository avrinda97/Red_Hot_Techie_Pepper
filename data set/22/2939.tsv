2009-05-02T01:59:00.000Z	grkblood13		i just hooked up a kvm switch and now the highest resolution i can get it 800*600 but the switch supports way higher than that, cna some1 help me out
2009-05-02T02:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	grkblood13	  You may need to manyally set the res in the xorg.conf. since X is not able to properly get the specs/info from the monitor with some kvm switches.
2009-05-02T02:01:00.000Z	grkblood13	Dr_Willis	wheres that at
2009-05-03T05:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	grkblood13	 ive seen/heard of others who set the specific res in xorg.conf with the modeline options.. but ive never done so.  and Yep its a issue with a lot of KVM switches.
2009-05-15T07:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	grkblood13	 err.. how would we know? :)
2009-12-28T07:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	grkblood13	 if the thing can play normal dvd videos. you can use 'devede' to make a dvd.
2009-12-28T07:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	grkblood13	 no idea. I find the whole 'hd' trend a bunch of buzzwords and bs.
2009-12-28T07:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	grkblood13	 theres ways to stream video to the ps3 withouit even making a disk
2009-12-28T07:09:00.000Z	grkblood13	Dr_Willis	i know
2010-01-03T21:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	grkblood13	 the cron deamon configs have a  setting for what email to send info to.
2010-01-03T21:02:00.000Z	grkblood13	Dr_Willis	where is that config file located?
2010-01-03T21:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	grkblood13	 /etc/cron.d/ perhaps.. id have to look.
2010-01-03T21:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	grkblood13	 i see a MAILTO in /etc/cron.d/munin
2010-01-03T21:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	grkblood13	 i am  using anacron on this system and the email setting just says 'MAILTO=root'
2010-01-19T03:14:00.000Z	grkblood13	Dr_Willis	its need for UDF 2.50 support
2010-01-19T03:19:00.000Z	grkblood13	Dr_Willis	you got any experience with it?
2010-01-19T03:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	grkblood13	 Nope. Ive never had the need to mess with nero in linux,  i recall tryiong it once ages and ages ago.. and thats it..
2010-01-19T03:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	grkblood13	 you never did state what the actual problem you are havbing with it is.
2010-01-19T03:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	grkblood13	 cant say taht ivev ever had the need for UDF 2.5 either.  best place would be to be checking the Nero Linux forums perhaps
2010-01-19T03:21:00.000Z	grkblood13	Dr_Willis	ive posted there
2010-01-24T07:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	grkblood13	 local lan? over teh internet? or how exactly? You can ssh in , and start a vncserver session and get a 'new' desktop  you can connect to
2010-01-24T07:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	grkblood13	 vnc can do more then 'share the current' desktop. Its a very flexiable tool
