2008-12-04T03:14:00.000Z	dumitru	gregord	i've just upgraded on ubuntu 8.10
2008-12-04T03:14:00.000Z	dumitru	gregord	trying to get it : sudo apt-get install kcontrol
2008-12-04T03:15:00.000Z	dumitru	gregord	E: Package kcontrol has no installation candidate
2008-12-04T03:15:00.000Z	dumitru	gregord	Package kcontrol is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2008-12-04T03:16:00.000Z	dumitru	gregord	what that mean?
2008-12-04T03:16:00.000Z	dumitru	gregord	no more kcontrol on ubuntu 8.10?
2008-12-04T03:17:00.000Z	gregord	dumitru	I guess not, although those fonts look fine to me
