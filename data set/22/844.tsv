2011-02-27T16:06:00.000Z	Raj007		quick question - I changed my hard drives around (physically), where do i edit my grub menu to stop pointing windows from SDD to SDA ? What file i mean, i'm in 10.10
2011-02-27T16:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raj007	 you could just set teh bios to boot the other hd.. and it may work properly.
2011-02-27T16:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raj007	 and rerun 'sudo update-grub' after you boot into linuix
2011-02-27T16:09:00.000Z	Raj007	Dr_Willis	ahh it auto-detected it on update-grub
2011-02-27T16:10:00.000Z	Raj007	Dr_Willis	i still have an old entry for an old windows on grub menu, how can i remove that?
2011-02-27T16:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raj007	  proberly can. but i rarely bother. :)
2011-02-27T16:11:00.000Z	Raj007	Dr_Willis	yeah i got 4 hard drives, so, old entries around one of them. I can live with it, but was just wondering.
2011-02-27T16:13:00.000Z	Raj007	Dr_Willis	oh, i did forget to thank you btw :)
2011-03-06T14:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raj007	 why do you think you need one?
2011-03-06T14:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raj007	 i have not seen a need for the identd in years.....
2011-03-06T14:24:00.000Z	Raj007	Dr_Willis	i figured that. No, i was just curious, it's been a *very* long time for me since i used Linux.
2011-03-06T14:24:00.000Z	Raj007	Dr_Willis	but thanks, i'll live without it too then.
2011-03-06T14:26:00.000Z	Raj007	Dr_Willis	Don't mind noob questions. Curious question - i see my used RAM at bootup (not cached/buffered) start at 400-410MB. After few hours jumps to 500, 1 day after it's 700+ (even after log on). Is that normal?
2011-03-06T14:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raj007	 its using it as cache for the disk
2011-03-06T14:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raj007	 hit google for 'linux ate my ram' for a site that details it.
2011-03-06T14:27:00.000Z	Raj007	Dr_Willis	ok will do, thanks.
2011-03-06T14:28:00.000Z	Raj007	Dr_Willis	i meant my free (minus cached/Buffers)
2011-03-06T14:30:00.000Z	Raj007	Dr_Willis	Ahh, i read play.html (second page), gotcha :)
2011-03-06T16:38:00.000Z	Raj007	Dr_Willis	curious, what do you use as your android phone?
2011-03-06T16:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raj007	 samsung captivate.
2011-03-06T16:44:00.000Z	Raj007	Dr_Willis	that is a good question by s7r, is there an undelete utility for EXTx ?
2011-03-06T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raj007	 theres tools for that.. good luck getting any actual data recovered.. :)
