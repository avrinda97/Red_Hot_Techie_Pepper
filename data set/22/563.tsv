2011-07-21T01:12:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Numn	yes
2011-07-21T00:45:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Numn	you want ubuntu 11.04 without unity? rww told you how
2011-07-21T00:47:00.000Z	Numn	ThinkT510	Ok, i know exackly. but i mean like erased from the system like its 10.10?
2011-07-21T00:48:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Numn	that is hard to do since unity is a custom shell built on top of gnome components, so i would leave it there
2011-07-21T00:49:00.000Z	Numn	ThinkT510	so you mean its would make gnome or ubuntu unstable?
2011-07-21T00:50:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Numn	trying to remove unity would likely remove a large part of gnome dependancies, which you need to run gnome
2011-07-21T00:52:00.000Z	Numn	ThinkT510	but i can still use 10.10 right? and update?
2011-07-21T00:52:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Numn	sure
2011-07-21T00:54:00.000Z	Numn	ThinkT510	i mean like not upgrading to 11.04 and still update some other files that maybe needs to be updated :D
2011-07-21T00:54:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Numn	not sure what you mean
2011-07-21T00:56:00.000Z	Numn	ThinkT510	ok like update importan update and still not upgrade to 11.04 ;)
2011-07-21T00:56:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Numn	you can stick with 10.10 if you like
2011-07-21T01:01:00.000Z	Numn	ThinkT510	i wish 10.10 is reviving in the future i really like it very much.. i dont like the new upgrades for ubuntu but that's my opinion
2011-07-21T01:02:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Numn	you could always try xfce or lxde if you don't like kde or gnome (xfce is my favourite)
2011-07-21T01:03:00.000Z	Numn	ThinkT510	the thing is that i love gnome but yea your right i think should use another window mangement for my taste
2011-07-21T01:05:00.000Z	Numn	ThinkT510	i main thing is that i dont like the unity.. and i any way getting if i update
2011-07-21T01:07:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Numn	i've never liked gnome so i've always stuck with xfce (xubuntu) so i never need to deal with gnome 2/3 or unity
2011-07-21T01:08:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Numn	there is also lubuntu (lxde) which is getting high praise too
2011-07-21T01:08:00.000Z	Numn	ThinkT510	if i want get rid of unity i need to get rid of gnome then? :)
2011-07-21T01:09:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Numn	another option is to use the mini iso and install what you want from there (get gnome without unity)
2011-07-21T01:11:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Numn	starting with 11.10 there will be no more gnome 2 though (but i think there is a fallback mode in gnome 3 to make it look similar)
2011-07-21T01:11:00.000Z	Numn	ThinkT510	so 11.04 and still without any unity then?
