2005-01-27T08:51:00.000Z	randabis		maybe you aren't burning it as an iso
2005-01-27T08:52:00.000Z	randabis		I use k3b so I'm not sure how to do it with cdrecord
2005-01-27T08:52:00.000Z	randabis		hmm let me check for you then
2005-01-27T08:54:00.000Z	randabis		if it does tell you, I don't see where
2005-01-27T08:54:00.000Z	randabis		there is...
2005-01-27T08:54:00.000Z	randabis		you have to give root a password
2005-01-27T08:56:00.000Z	sladen	randabis	you have made that choice;  but other users may wish to use the shipping default provided by ubuntu, which is to use sudo---eg. Mac OSX does exactly the same
2005-01-27T08:56:00.000Z	randabis	sladen	I just gave him a password, I don't ever use root
2005-01-27T08:57:00.000Z	sladen	randabis	by doing that, you cause fun when trying to use single-user-mode
2005-01-27T08:59:00.000Z	sladen	randabis	it's another way into your system.  If you aren't using it, then probably safest to disable it again back to the default with   sudo passwd -l
2005-01-28T17:13:00.000Z	sladen	randabis	what error message does it give?
2005-01-28T17:15:00.000Z	randabis	sladen	it gives no error, the screen just goes black, then I have to CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE
2005-01-28T17:17:00.000Z	sladen	randabis	what happens if you do   ./doom3 2>&1 > doom3-logfile.txt
2005-01-28T17:19:00.000Z	randabis	sladen	same thing, hence why I disappeared for a moment
2005-01-28T17:22:00.000Z	randabis	sladen	no ideas?
2005-01-28T17:22:00.000Z	sladen	randabis	x86 !!!
2005-01-28T17:23:00.000Z	sladen	randabis	sorry, I'm getting questions mixed up, what's your
2005-01-28T17:23:00.000Z	sladen	randabis	okay, did you get a logfile like I suggested?
2005-01-28T17:26:00.000Z	randabis	sladen	logfile is blank
2005-01-28T17:27:00.000Z	sladen	randabis	Google reckons:  oom III would hang during starting if you redirect the output. Pass +set in_tty 0 on the command line to fix: $ doom3 +set in_tty 0 > output.txt
2005-02-27T16:43:00.000Z	sladen	randabis	fbsplash/gensplash didn't exist at the time we started trying to solve the problem!
2005-02-27T16:43:00.000Z	randabis	sladen	ah
