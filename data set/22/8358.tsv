2005-11-07T16:41:00.000Z	Stormx2		Hi?
2005-11-07T16:41:00.000Z	Stormx2		Could someone give me a hand?
2005-11-07T16:42:00.000Z	Stormx2		I'm wondering. In terminal, why does    echo -n "Rename? (y/n) > "      not prompt for user input? it just ends the script......
2005-11-07T16:43:00.000Z	n1xt3r	Stormx2	slow down and take a moment to read the bash man pages - I think you want "read".
2005-11-07T16:43:00.000Z	Stormx2	n1xt3r	I have read.
2005-11-07T16:45:00.000Z	n1xt3r	Stormx2	don't set response, and use case instead
2005-11-07T16:45:00.000Z	Stormx2	n1xt3r	 Hmm, how do you mean?
2005-11-07T16:46:00.000Z	Stormx2	n1xt3r	I'm rushing into the whole bash scripting thing I know. I've coded before but ;-)
2005-11-07T16:47:00.000Z	n1xt3r	Stormx2	use the "case" construct e.g. case $response in ... y) command;; ... esac
2005-11-07T16:47:00.000Z	Stormx2	n1xt3r	ok
2005-11-07T16:47:00.000Z	Stormx2	n1xt3r	Can't understand why it would make a difference though! its no even prompting for user input, its ending the script...
2005-11-07T16:48:00.000Z	Stormx2	n1xt3r	Actually, its not ending the script.
2005-11-07T16:51:00.000Z	n1xt3r	Stormx2	try replacing 'echo -n...' with read -p '... ? '
2005-11-07T16:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	n1xt3r	OK
2005-11-07T16:52:00.000Z	Stormx2	n1xt3r	But then how does it set the variable?
2005-11-07T16:52:00.000Z	n1xt3r	Stormx2	with read -p '... ? ' response
2005-11-07T16:52:00.000Z	Stormx2	n1xt3r	k
2005-11-07T16:53:00.000Z	Stormx2	n1xt3r	:( working even less
2005-11-07T16:54:00.000Z	Stormx2	n1xt3r	  read -p "Rename $old to $new? (y/n) > " renameit
2005-11-07T16:55:00.000Z	n1xt3r	Stormx2	try debugging with 'bash -xv ./scriptname'
2005-11-07T16:56:00.000Z	Stormx2	n1xt3r	k
2005-11-07T16:58:00.000Z	Stormx2	n1xt3r	The problem is that its reading it wrong. Firstly, its not pausing at the "echo -n" bit, secondly its reading from a pervious echo statement/variable
