2006-09-05T05:40:00.000Z	hondje		I'm not sure when I say this, opexoc, but even if the right drivers weren't loaded, there should be 'something' in messages or dmesg
2006-09-05T05:41:00.000Z	opexoc_	hondje	so I tell you that in messages 'something' is.
2006-09-05T05:42:00.000Z	opexoc_	hondje	but what should I do now if i can;t reinstall my hplip and my libc6 packagaes are broken?
2006-09-05T05:43:00.000Z	opexoc_	hondje	;/
2006-09-05T05:44:00.000Z	opexoc_	hondje	Can I back up my system to work like before?
2006-09-05T05:47:00.000Z	opexoc_	hondje	hm... I would rather reinstall my system... it is only way... i am even not sure what did i do :(. I was trying to install this hplip package so much and I don't care what will be done if i use some not-dapper pacakge...
2006-09-05T05:48:00.000Z	hondje	opexoc_	I see. Well, first I would probably reinstall just because libc6 is kinda important and something 'went wrong' to break it pretty badly
2006-09-05T05:48:00.000Z	hondje	opexoc_	Then I would do as suggested before and use the available hplip package, which you can install via synaptic or 'apt-get install hplip'
2006-09-05T05:49:00.000Z	opexoc_	hondje	ok but someone else told something about some other pacakge hpjin or something? is it neccesary?
2006-09-05T05:50:00.000Z	hondje	opexoc_	I would google to make sure hplip is the driver you want...but for most all-in-ones it is
2006-09-05T05:50:00.000Z	opexoc_	hondje	hmm... do you use some all-in-ones ?
2006-09-05T05:51:00.000Z	hondje	opexoc_	http://www.linuxprinting.org/ has a reliable list
2006-09-05T05:51:00.000Z	hondje	opexoc_	Yes, I have 3 I set up in linux
2006-09-05T05:52:00.000Z	hondje	opexoc_	The only one that caused me much work is the one I'm using at this box, a PSC2110w
2006-09-05T05:53:00.000Z	opexoc_	hondje	and do you relay on this avaliable package in dapper? don't you install some from sourceforge?
2006-09-05T05:54:00.000Z	hondje	opexoc_	Yes, I haven't had a problem with it yet
2006-09-05T05:54:00.000Z	opexoc_	hondje	Do you install some with HP Photosmart C4100 series ?
2006-09-05T05:55:00.000Z	opexoc_	hondje	Have you installed some with HP Photosmart C4100 series ?
2006-09-05T05:56:00.000Z	hondje	opexoc_	No, but look here: http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=HP-PhotoSmart_C4100
2006-09-05T05:58:00.000Z	opexoc_	hondje	ok but should I uninstall hplip before?
2006-09-05T05:59:00.000Z	hondje	opexoc_	I don't know, but I would just out of principle
2006-09-05T06:00:00.000Z	opexoc_	hondje	Sorry but I am a poory english man :) and I don't really understand everything what was you said to me. What does it mean "just out of"?
