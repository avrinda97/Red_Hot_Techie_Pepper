2009-02-24T21:11:00.000Z	justmozzy		hi guys
2009-02-24T21:11:00.000Z	justmozzy		how are you doing?
2009-02-24T21:12:00.000Z	justmozzy		I am new to ubuntu and have following problem: I installed everything but unfortunately the screen resolution is very low (600x400). I installed the NVIDIA driver but still no luck. Also tried to add a new mode using xrandr but it told me that the new mode (1024x768) was not found. Anyone can help me with this?\
2009-02-24T21:14:00.000Z	mhall119	justmozzy	was your monitor plugged in?
2009-02-24T21:15:00.000Z	justmozzy	mhall119	yupp, plugged in since I started the installation
2009-02-24T21:15:00.000Z	mhall119	justmozzy	read the xorg log in /var
2009-02-24T21:15:00.000Z	mhall119		it might tell you what it failing
2009-02-24T21:15:00.000Z	justmozzy	mhall119	thanks, I'll check it
2009-02-24T21:16:00.000Z	mhall119	justmozzy	what nvidia driver are you using?
2009-02-24T21:16:00.000Z	mhall119		some of them were not updated to work on the latest Xorg server
2009-02-24T21:19:00.000Z	justmozzy	mhall119	humm.... didn't go through everything yet, but in one entry it told me that the NVIDIA GPU was not found :s
2009-02-24T21:19:00.000Z	mhall119	justmozzy	what card do you have?
2009-02-24T21:20:00.000Z	justmozzy	mhall119	NVIDIA Geforce 7200 I think...
2009-02-24T21:21:00.000Z	mhall119	justmozzy	and which driver?
2009-02-24T21:22:00.000Z	justmozzy	mhall119	After I installed Ubuntu it told me to install the proprietary driver "NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (latest cards)
2009-02-24T21:23:00.000Z	justmozzy	mhall119	It is to be exact the Geforce 7300
2009-02-24T21:23:00.000Z	mhall119		well, there's 4 packages for nvidia proprietary drivers, I think two of them work,not sure which one you have
2009-02-24T21:23:00.000Z	justmozzy	mhall119	humm... ok... I will try to update everything and see then if I can install something else
2009-02-24T21:24:00.000Z	mhall119	justmozzy	check which nvidia package you have
2009-02-24T21:24:00.000Z	justmozzy	mhall119	Where can I check that?
2009-02-24T21:25:00.000Z	mhall119	justmozzy	you might also try using the "nv" driver instead, you won't get compiz, but you'll get better than 640x480
2009-02-24T21:25:00.000Z	mhall119	justmozzy	synaptic
