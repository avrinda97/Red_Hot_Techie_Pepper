2009-12-26T02:56:00.000Z	vap0r		im trying to install a plugin for pidgin, but i have to compile it. im in the directory i unpacked the archive into and i typed "make" and pressed enter but it just gave me a bunch of error messages. what am I doing wrong?
2009-12-26T02:57:00.000Z	guntbert	vap0r	usually there is a README
2009-12-26T02:57:00.000Z	vap0r	guntbert	im following the directions as laid out EXACTLY in the readme
2009-12-26T02:58:00.000Z	guntbert	vap0r	then the author probably made a mistake, did you run ./configure ?
2009-12-26T02:59:00.000Z	vap0r	guntbert	what is ./configure for?
2009-12-26T03:00:00.000Z	guntbert	vap0r	*if* there is a configure file it sets up the compilation environment and creates the make file
2009-12-26T03:00:00.000Z	vap0r	guntbert	Note: in the readme it says: "This is a source distribution and requires a working compiler toolchain."
2009-12-26T03:03:00.000Z	guntbert	vap0r	install that
2009-12-26T03:04:00.000Z	vap0r	guntbert	the "build-essential" package doesn't exist
2009-12-26T03:05:00.000Z	guntbert	vap0r	what version of ubuntu?
2009-12-26T03:06:00.000Z	vap0r	guntbert	the latest and greatest
2009-12-26T03:06:00.000Z	vap0r	guntbert	karmic
2009-12-26T03:07:00.000Z	guntbert	vap0r	type sudo aptitude update (to update the database), then sudo aptitude install build-essential
2009-12-26T03:10:00.000Z	vap0r	guntbert	whoops I already had it installed, but for new trouble, for some mystical reason the package appears in synaptic when i type the first 5 letters, then disappears when i type the hyphen. I love ubuntu.
2009-12-26T03:11:00.000Z	guntbert	vap0r	I think its time to !paste the output of your make attempt
2009-12-26T03:14:00.000Z	vap0r	guntbert	http://pastebin.org/68700
2009-12-26T03:15:00.000Z	guntbert	vap0r	I assume you *have* pidgin installed?
2009-12-26T03:15:00.000Z	vap0r	guntbert	yes
2009-12-26T03:17:00.000Z	guntbert	vap0r	I'm not certain but it could be that the author assumed you have pidgin complied from source too - I really suggest to ask the author
2009-12-26T03:18:00.000Z	vap0r	guntbert	ok thanks
2009-12-26T03:18:00.000Z	guntbert	vap0r	Good luck :-)
2009-12-26T03:18:00.000Z	vap0r	guntbert	thanks
