2010-10-14T23:00:00.000Z	sandking		i tried to remove default keyring but it tells me that there's no .gnome2 dir!
2010-10-14T23:00:00.000Z	sandking		where could it be stored ?
2010-10-14T23:01:00.000Z	Richie086	sandking	under your home folder?
2010-10-14T23:01:00.000Z	sandking	Richie086	ah. i thought that in main folder
2010-10-14T23:01:00.000Z	Richie086		so /home/sandking/.gnome2
2010-10-14T23:02:00.000Z	Richie086	sandking	if you are not seeing .gnome2 in your home folder try ls -lh | grep .gnome2
2010-10-14T23:02:00.000Z	Richie086		. means it will be hidden usually when you list the contents of the dir
2010-10-14T23:02:00.000Z	sandking	Richie086	no, it's there. just the keyring file was named differently
2010-10-14T23:03:00.000Z	Richie086	sandking	oh is it working now?
2010-10-14T23:03:00.000Z	sandking		i see login.keyring instead of default.keyring
2010-10-14T23:03:00.000Z	sandking		i suppose it's the same?
2010-10-14T23:03:00.000Z	Richie086	sandking	can you rename the file?
2010-10-14T23:03:00.000Z	Richie086	sandking	should not be an issue
2010-10-14T23:04:00.000Z	sandking	Richie086	bareword not allowed while strict subs in use...
2010-10-14T23:05:00.000Z	sandking	Richie086	removing it should not make anything bad, right?
2010-10-14T23:05:00.000Z	Richie086	sandking	what are u doing in order to get that error?
2010-10-14T23:05:00.000Z	Richie086	sandking	removing what?  the keyring file?
2010-10-14T23:06:00.000Z	Richie086	sandking	try cp login.keyring default.keyring
2010-10-14T23:06:00.000Z	sandking	Richie086	i do "rename login.keyring xkeyring"
2010-10-14T23:07:00.000Z	sandking	Richie086	and yes, i wanted to remove keyring file
2010-10-14T23:07:00.000Z	Richie086	sandking	check pm
2010-10-14T23:07:00.000Z	sandking	Richie086	well, i removed it anyway.
