2008-12-24T15:57:00.000Z	ardchoille	mysticdarkhack	have you seen other gdm themes ubuntu offers? have you seen http://www.gnome-look.org ?
2008-12-24T16:00:00.000Z	ardchoille	mysticdarkhack	you can always copy a gdm theme from /ust/share/gdm/themes and modify it to suit your needs

2008-12-24T16:44:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	ardchoille	once agian, thank you
2008-12-24T16:46:00.000Z	ardchoille	mysticdarkhack	I use gkrellm to monitor bandwidth, cpu, procs, hd sizes, email, memory, swap and other things, it's a great app
2008-12-24T16:47:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	ardchoille	well can it monitor bandwidth usage
2008-12-24T16:48:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	ardchoille	comcast and other isp is start to cap bandwidth so just need something to help know my usage
2008-12-24T16:48:00.000Z	ardchoille	mysticdarkhack	oh, no, I don't think gkrellm monitors how much you've used, it just displays the current and last minute or so
2008-12-24T16:49:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	ardchoille	I find app for windows but I'm a full linux user
2008-12-24T16:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	mysticdarkhack	perhaps this?  bandwidthd - Tracks usage of TCP/IP and builds html files with graphs
2008-12-24T16:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	mysticdarkhack	apt-cache search bandwidth | more
2008-12-24T16:50:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	ardchoille	guess I'll give it a tried
2008-12-24T16:51:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	ardchoille	so you not worrying about bandwidth cap?
2008-12-24T16:51:00.000Z	ardchoille	mysticdarkhack	I don't transfer enough to worry about it really
2008-12-24T16:52:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	ardchoille	lol I see. Well At least that a good thing in you side
