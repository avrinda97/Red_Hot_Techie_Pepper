2008-11-03T21:29:00.000Z	Vhozard		Can someone help me with chmod and chown? I have screwed up things a bit.
2008-11-03T21:29:00.000Z	jrib	Vhozard	(or be more specific)
2008-11-03T21:30:00.000Z	jrib	Vhozard	without -R ?
2008-11-03T21:33:00.000Z	jrib	Vhozard	reinstall
2008-11-03T21:34:00.000Z	Vhozard	jrib	-.- crap, my install took AGES because of my Fake_RAID
2008-11-03T21:47:00.000Z	jrib	Vhozard	there are ways, but reinstalling is much faster
2010-11-14T05:16:00.000Z	jrib	Vhozard	what do you want to do exactly?
2010-11-14T05:17:00.000Z	jrib	Vhozard	there's no such service as xxxx
2010-11-14T05:17:00.000Z	jrib	Vhozard	if you just want documentation on upstart, I can give you that.   If you are trying to accomplish something specific, then just tell us what it is...
2010-11-14T05:19:00.000Z	jrib	Vhozard	sigh... use update-rc.d then (though you were never supposed to use that as a user.  You're supposed to use something like sysv-rc-conf)
2010-11-14T05:20:00.000Z	jrib	Vhozard	because you aren't tell us what you are actually doing.
2010-11-14T05:23:00.000Z	jrib	Vhozard	you don't have to do anything if you just edited the contents of the file, they are just symlinks
2010-11-14T05:25:00.000Z	jrib	Vhozard	what is "it"?
2010-11-14T05:26:00.000Z	jrib	Vhozard	rtorrent says "sudo: /etc/init.d/rtorrent: command not found"?
2010-11-14T05:26:00.000Z	Vhozard	jrib	im sorry
2010-11-14T05:26:00.000Z	jrib	Vhozard	did you create this thing?
2010-11-14T05:27:00.000Z	Vhozard	jrib	I downloaded it from a website
2010-11-14T05:27:00.000Z	Vhozard	jrib	I will pastebin it
2010-11-14T05:27:00.000Z	jrib	Vhozard	make sure it's executable
2010-11-14T05:27:00.000Z	Vhozard	jrib	DOH!
2010-11-14T05:27:00.000Z	Vhozard	jrib	thanks, forgot that
2010-11-14T05:27:00.000Z	Vhozard	jrib	it works now :)
