2008-05-02T07:20:00.000Z	microwaver	ToddEDM	you want your wireless device working on your other system?
2008-05-02T07:21:00.000Z	microwaver	ToddEDM	can u attach an ethernet cable to your other device?
2008-05-02T07:21:00.000Z	microwaver	ToddEDM	hmmm....
2008-05-02T07:22:00.000Z	microwaver	ToddEDM	Yeah, figured that out. I'm thinking of finding a way what ngdisgtk uses o files so you can put it on usb $> other device
2008-05-02T07:23:00.000Z	microwaver	ToddEDM	http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/net/ndisgtk perhaps this does the trick
2008-05-02T07:23:00.000Z	microwaver	ToddEDM	this and ofcourse the driver itself
2008-05-02T07:24:00.000Z	ToddEDM	microwaver	 thx

2008-05-02T07:28:00.000Z	microwaver	ToddEDM	I think that's OR a screensaver error OR a splashscreen error
2008-05-02T07:30:00.000Z	microwaver	ToddEDM	does your computer show a ubuntu loading bar when starting up?
2008-05-02T07:30:00.000Z	ToddEDM	microwaver	 yeah
2008-05-02T07:31:00.000Z	microwaver	ToddEDM	I don't know of such a problem. what you could try is when you leave for a while : do ctrl + alt + l to lock, see if the GUI crashes then
2008-05-02T07:53:00.000Z	ToddEDM	microwaver	... what was that link you gave me before?
2008-05-02T07:53:00.000Z	microwaver	ToddEDM	https://help.ubuntu.com/7.10/internet/C/ndiswrapper.html
2008-05-02T07:54:00.000Z	ToddEDM	microwaver	 i disabled screensaver and it still went crazy
2008-05-02T07:54:00.000Z	microwaver	ToddEDM	hmmm. wouldn't know what ekse to do
