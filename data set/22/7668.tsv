2006-01-28T14:13:00.000Z	gia	johanbr	switching to gnome on my other machine to try it out
2006-01-28T14:16:00.000Z	gia	johanbr	I'm not seeing how to disable it on my fedora machine.  All I get is "Select windows when the mouse moves over them" "raise selected windows after an interval" "double-click titlebar to perform this action:  " and "to move a window, press-and-hold this key then grab the window:"
2006-01-28T14:18:00.000Z	johanbr	gia	Oh, I think I understand now. Is that it you want windows in stay in the background, even when clicked? If so, you'll probably have to switch to another window manager.
2006-01-28T14:19:00.000Z	gia	johanbr	yeah, you got it.  That's why I personally made the switch to kde
2006-01-28T14:20:00.000Z	johanbr	gia	Or you could use something like openbox instead of metacity. Works well under gnome.
2006-01-28T14:21:00.000Z	johanbr	gia	But I agree with you that moving to kde is looking better all the time. I think Linus had a point with the whole "dumbing down" flamewar.
2006-01-28T14:21:00.000Z	gia	johanbr	that just went over my head, unless openbox and metacity are window managers, and even if they are, I've never toyed with window managers and know nothing about them ;-)
2006-01-28T14:22:00.000Z	gia	johanbr	I was personally shocked to see that, but yes, he has.
2006-01-28T14:23:00.000Z	johanbr	gia	openbox and metacity are indeed window managers. Not really more complicated than doing "apt-get install openbox" and "openbox --replace &".
2006-01-28T14:25:00.000Z	gia	johanbr	hrm, and you know I would be able to achieve this with openbox?
2006-01-28T14:26:00.000Z	johanbr	gia	I have to admit I don't know for sure, but openbox is so customizable that I'd be very surprised if you couldn't.
2006-01-28T14:27:00.000Z	johanbr	gia	Now I know for sure: http://icculus.org/openbox/2/rc.php . Search for "raise" on that page.
2006-01-28T14:28:00.000Z	johanbr	gia	Really? Which release are you using?
2006-01-28T14:35:00.000Z	johanbr	gia	metacity --replace &
2006-01-28T14:37:00.000Z	gia	johanbr	is there a way to make it so that if I load kde, kwin will come up, and if I load gnome, openbox will come up?
2006-01-28T14:40:00.000Z	gia	johanbr	ty again
2006-01-28T14:59:00.000Z	johanbr	gia	I wouldn't worry too much about that, it just complains about some non-existent config files. As long as it still runs, it should be okay.
2006-01-28T15:00:00.000Z	gia	johanbr	right, but those config files are the way I can turn on sloppywhatever
2006-01-28T15:01:00.000Z	gia	johanbr	can you send me the link to the openbox config options again?
2006-01-28T15:02:00.000Z	johanbr	gia	http://icculus.org/openbox/2/rc.php
