2012-02-24T03:42:00.000Z	NyLes		can i use a driver from puppy linux?
2012-02-24T03:42:00.000Z	tlhonmey	NyLes	Definite Maybe.
2012-02-24T03:43:00.000Z	NyLes	tlhonmey	how will i do it?
2012-02-24T03:43:00.000Z	tlhonmey	NyLes	But what driver is included in a minimal distro like Puppy that's not installed in Ubuntu?
2012-02-24T03:44:00.000Z	NyLes	tlhonmey	soundcard driver.. Intel Corporation 82801BA/BAM Ac'97
2012-02-24T03:45:00.000Z	tlhonmey	NyLes	How do you know that it's a driver issue?
2012-02-24T03:46:00.000Z	tlhonmey	NyLes	I would be highly surprised if that one wasn't included in Ubuntu...
2012-02-24T03:47:00.000Z	NyLes	tlhonmey	but i think it isn't or the alsa in ubuntu is so up-to-date xD
2012-02-24T03:48:00.000Z	tlhonmey	NyLes	Ok, well linux drivers are generally kernel modules.  It will probably work to get the source for the kernel module that puppy linux is using to run the card, compile, and install it on your system.
2012-02-24T03:48:00.000Z	tlhonmey	NyLes	Where they keep the source and how to tell which one you need is more a question for the Puppy people.
2012-02-24T03:48:00.000Z	NyLes	tlhonmey	can i just recompile it using the puppy linux live cd?
2012-02-24T03:49:00.000Z	tlhonmey	NyLes	Most of the sound issues I've had with Ubuntu though have been ALSA related, not driver related though...  Run a web search on your card and see if anyone else has solved the problem in an easier manner.
2012-02-24T03:49:00.000Z	tlhonmey	NyLes	Puppy linux live cds don't include source.
2012-02-24T03:49:00.000Z	NyLes	tlhonmey	thanks so much..
2012-02-24T03:50:00.000Z	tlhonmey	NyLes	I think there is a channel here for Puppy, they might be able to help you find out which module you need.
2012-02-24T03:51:00.000Z	NyLes	tlhonmey	there is? ok i'll look for it..
2012-02-24T03:51:00.000Z	tlhonmey	NyLes	If not, check their forums.  They're pretty helpful.
2012-02-24T04:04:00.000Z	NyLes	tlhonmey	do you think it has something to do with the alsa version?
2012-02-24T04:06:00.000Z	tlhonmey	NyLes	That is the most common cause of sound issues I
2012-02-24T04:06:00.000Z	NyLes	tlhonmey	thanks..
2012-02-24T04:07:00.000Z	tlhonmey	NyLes	That's a fairly common card, you should probably check the Ubuntu forums if you haven't already, there may be a solution posted.
2012-02-24T04:07:00.000Z	NyLes	tlhonmey	ok thanks..
