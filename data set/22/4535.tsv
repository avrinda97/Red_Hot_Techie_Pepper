2008-05-30T08:59:00.000Z	Zikiti		Hello, what drivers do I need to load  Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG wireless driver?
2008-05-30T09:00:00.000Z	usser	Zikiti	iwl3945
2008-05-30T09:00:00.000Z	usser	Zikiti	on hardy, ipw3945 on gutsy and older
2008-05-30T09:02:00.000Z	usser	Zikiti	iwl3945 is included in the installation, one thing u might wanna do is install backports package
2008-05-30T09:02:00.000Z	usser	Zikiti	it has an updated intel driver
2008-05-30T09:02:00.000Z	usser	Zikiti	its not in any of the packages this driver is opensource and include in the kernel
2008-05-30T09:03:00.000Z	usser	Zikiti	the driver is relatively new and unstable, many people report issues with it, try backports package
2008-05-30T09:06:00.000Z	Zikiti	usser	still can't se it in the repo... even did a search for 3945
2008-05-30T09:07:00.000Z	usser	Zikiti	sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-hardy
2008-05-30T09:30:00.000Z	Zikiti	usser	Ok the driver is loaded but I can't connect to any wireless network
2008-05-30T09:31:00.000Z	usser	Zikiti	do u see any networks at all?
2008-05-30T09:31:00.000Z	Zikiti	usser	yes I see them
2008-05-30T09:31:00.000Z	Zikiti	usser	even tried creating my own
2008-05-30T09:34:00.000Z	usser	Zikiti	hm... when u try to connect to one of those, immediately after it fails run dmesg and pastebin its output
2008-05-30T10:07:00.000Z	Zikiti	usser	one more time... ican't get net access right now but in my message log all I see is this: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready
2008-05-30T10:09:00.000Z	Zikiti	usser	as I was saying... "ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready" is the message I see
2008-05-30T10:09:00.000Z	usser	Zikiti	thats not enough...arrg. ok do sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers
2008-05-30T10:10:00.000Z	usser	Zikiti	then head on to http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Download
2008-05-30T10:10:00.000Z	usser	Zikiti	and follow the instructions on that site
2008-05-30T10:11:00.000Z	usser	Zikiti	oh ok no problem
2008-05-30T10:14:00.000Z	usser	Zikiti	see the thing is gutsy used proprietary ipw3945 driver which was pretty good but it was closed hardy decided that opensource iwl3945 was ready when apparently it wasnt
2008-05-30T10:14:00.000Z	usser	Zikiti	pissed me off to but it was still a right decision u'll get better support for OSS driver on the long run
