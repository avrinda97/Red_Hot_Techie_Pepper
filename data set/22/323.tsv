2012-01-24T10:21:00.000Z	LastArms		I need some help, not sure what to google. I have a 11.10 ubuntu server. for some reason it stops at "Starting MySQL server" and stops there. I can ssh in but I'm wondering why it doesn't show a login prompt...
2012-01-24T10:21:00.000Z	LastArms		I was hoping to run openbox on it...
2012-01-24T10:22:00.000Z	yabai_	LastArms	Can you hit ctrl alt f2 and get to prompt?
2012-01-24T10:23:00.000Z	LastArms	yabai_	yes
2012-01-24T10:24:00.000Z	LastArms	yabai_	f7 is the only that has X so I can run openbox right?
2012-01-24T10:25:00.000Z	yabai_	LastArms	Not sure i understand you
2012-01-24T10:27:00.000Z	yabai_	LastArms	Sure
2012-01-24T10:28:00.000Z	yabai_	LastArms	What you use to login? Gdm?
2012-01-24T10:28:00.000Z	LastArms	yabai_	I was hoping for a login prompt like the ones you see on f1 f2 f3 ..
2012-01-24T10:28:00.000Z	yabai_	LastArms	Login from f1 and manually start openbox
2012-01-24T10:29:00.000Z	LastArms	yabai_	failed to open display
2012-01-24T10:30:00.000Z	yabai_	LastArms	What command did u run?

2012-01-24T10:31:00.000Z	yabai_	LastArms	Try startx
