2011-11-17T02:03:00.000Z	armor-64		Hi I have a problem here!the sound in Ubuntu stopped working!!!!solution??
2011-11-17T02:04:00.000Z	iceroot	armor-64	type "alsamixer" and see if something is muted htere
2011-11-17T02:06:00.000Z	armor-64	iceroot	no every thing is 50 %!!!!!something else???
2011-11-17T02:07:00.000Z	iceroot	armor-64	and not muted? (there is a symbol below that graphs)
2011-11-17T02:08:00.000Z	armor-64	iceroot	yes everythning is ok!!!i forgot to mantion that i am using external PCI soundcard!!!
2011-11-17T02:08:00.000Z	armor-64	iceroot	: but the pc is reading the card corectly!!
2011-11-17T02:08:00.000Z	iceroot	armor-64	with f6 you can choose the soundcard, is the correct one selected?
2011-11-17T02:09:00.000Z	iceroot	armor-64	in alsamixer
2011-11-17T02:10:00.000Z	armor-64	iceroot	: yes i check that too but nothing!!!it's weard because one day when i open the pc it wasind working,the on board sound is working!!
2011-11-17T02:10:00.000Z	iceroot	armor-64	sounds strange, sorry dont know another solution
2011-11-17T02:11:00.000Z	armor-64	iceroot	me too my friend,i consider to format or instaling gnome 3 to see if it is working!by the way in windows 7 the card is working perfect!
2011-11-17T02:12:00.000Z	iceroot	armor-64	you are not using gnome at the moment?
2011-11-17T02:12:00.000Z	iceroot	armor-64	i am asking because lubuntu is not using pulse-audio by default
2011-11-17T02:13:00.000Z	armor-64	iceroot	not event installed,i am using alsamixer,the default by installing ubuntu
2011-11-17T02:13:00.000Z	iceroot	armor-64	then you should also have pulseaudio when using normal ubuntu
2011-11-17T02:14:00.000Z	iceroot	armor-64	i am not sure if "pavucontrol" is installed by default but its a nice app to manage volume for different soundcards, maybe have a look there
2011-11-17T02:15:00.000Z	armor-64	iceroot	i give it a shot!w8 a second and i will tell you the result
2011-11-17T02:18:00.000Z	armor-64	iceroot	sorry to tell this but the program you told me it's telling me that it's working perfectly the sound,i will install gnome and see if it works!!if not then format!!!
2011-11-17T02:19:00.000Z	iceroot	armor-64	and what are you using at the moment when not gnome?
2011-11-17T02:20:00.000Z	armor-64	iceroot	: unity! i give up on gnome becouse gnome 3 is not the style that i like,ubuntu 10.04 style is what i liked much!!!
2011-11-17T02:20:00.000Z	iceroot	armor-64	for me unity and gnome3 is the same :)
2011-11-17T02:21:00.000Z	armor-64	iceroot	:w8 i will logout and see if threre is change on sound
