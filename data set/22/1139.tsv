2010-09-27T09:59:00.000Z	icarus-c	Sterist	ooo don't blame Windows file system.  Windows itself is not good anyway
2010-09-27T10:00:00.000Z	Sterist	icarus-c	no seriously lol fragmentation causes SO many problems
2010-09-27T10:00:00.000Z	icarus-c	Sterist	that is about the driver, hence the kernel

2010-09-27T10:20:00.000Z	Sterist	icarus-c	pulled from a question, not an answer
2010-09-27T10:23:00.000Z	icarus-c	Sterist	do you have "/sys/class/video4linux/video0/vflip"  ?
2010-09-27T10:24:00.000Z	icarus-c	Sterist	if you do,  sudo echo 1 > /sys/class/video4linux/video0/vflip  should do.  but that exist only on some devices
2010-09-27T10:26:00.000Z	Sterist	icarus-c	is that for external cameras?
2010-09-27T10:27:00.000Z	icarus-c	Sterist	i don't know. it came from a forum thread, issue appears on laptop
2010-09-27T10:32:00.000Z	icarus-c	Sterist	don't worry, i have no vfilp file too
2010-09-30T10:13:00.000Z	icarus-c	Sterist	btrfs isn't even stable yet
2010-09-30T10:14:00.000Z	Sterist	icarus-c	its going to be in 10.10
2010-09-30T10:14:00.000Z	icarus-c	Sterist	if you can stand data lose or file system corruption or any crap, go btrfs
2010-09-30T10:15:00.000Z	icarus-c	Sterist	not sure how btrfs status is currently, but at least 10.10 will be shipping a newer linux kernel
