2005-07-27T12:12:00.000Z	Maranda		This is an absurdly awesome distro.
2005-07-27T12:14:00.000Z	Maranda		Don't get excited, this is my girlfriend's nick.
2005-07-27T12:14:00.000Z	Maranda		I'm male.
2005-07-27T12:15:00.000Z	Maranda		Anyway, question. I have an atheros car, and I did iwconfig ath0 essid, and then my ssid.
2005-07-27T12:15:00.000Z	Maranda		Yet no connection.
2005-07-27T12:16:00.000Z	Maranda		Can I have help?
2005-07-27T12:17:00.000Z	Maranda		ATheros card, recognized, i slapped my ssid into it, still no connection.
2005-07-27T12:17:00.000Z	bob2	Maranda	your AP has no wep or wpa?  other systems work? does it associate?
2005-07-27T12:18:00.000Z	bob2	Maranda	sudo dhclient ath0
2005-07-27T12:18:00.000Z	bob2	Maranda	use 'iwconfig ath0' to see if it's associated or not, first
2005-07-27T12:25:00.000Z	bob2	Maranda	show us the first line of your iwconfig output
2005-07-27T12:35:00.000Z	bob2	Maranda	that's the only mention of it?
2005-07-27T12:40:00.000Z	bob2	Maranda	well, it's not associating,m anyway, so assigning ips and whatever won't help
2005-07-27T12:41:00.000Z	bob2	Maranda	I'm not sure what the problem is
2005-07-27T12:41:00.000Z	bob2	Maranda	perhaps the driver for your card is buggy
2005-07-27T12:41:00.000Z	bob2	Maranda	youre sure other machines can work with the AP fine?
2005-07-27T12:43:00.000Z	bob2	Maranda	setting the essid should be enough
2005-07-27T12:43:00.000Z	bob2	Maranda	you're sure you're in range and whatever?
2005-07-27T12:47:00.000Z	bob2	Maranda	on the AP?
2005-07-27T13:09:00.000Z	bob2	Maranda	I've only ever heard of one, which used to try to exploit old broken versions of a print server on redhat
2005-07-27T13:13:00.000Z	bob2	Maranda	no
2005-07-27T13:13:00.000Z	bob2	Maranda	you can save data to a usb drive or hard disk, tho
