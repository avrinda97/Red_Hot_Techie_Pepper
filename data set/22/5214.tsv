2007-06-19T11:26:00.000Z	kravlin		what's the name of the partitioning utility in Ubuntu?
2007-06-19T11:28:00.000Z	kravlin		another question. If i want to allocate empty space to a new partition how would i go about finding out what parts are free and which arent?
2007-06-19T11:30:00.000Z	kravlin		i don't want to loose any of the info i have.
2007-06-19T11:32:00.000Z	kravlin		so if i were to run fdisk right now it would defrag my harddrive?
2007-06-19T11:33:00.000Z	holycow	kravlin	*hint* there is NO defrag on linux *hint*
2007-06-19T11:34:00.000Z	kravlin		got it.
2007-06-19T11:34:00.000Z	kravlin		ok. then how do i create a partition?
2007-06-19T11:35:00.000Z	holycow	kravlin	cfdisk
2007-06-19T11:35:00.000Z	holycow		or gparted
2007-06-19T11:35:00.000Z	holycow		or qtparted
2007-06-19T11:35:00.000Z	holycow		or about a billion other tools
2007-06-19T11:36:00.000Z	kravlin	holycow	: i get cannot open disk...
2007-06-19T11:37:00.000Z	holycow	kravlin	all utilities requiring admin priviledges, oh say like creating partitions, need to be run as sudo
2007-06-19T11:37:00.000Z	holycow		!sudo
2007-06-19T11:37:00.000Z	kravlin	holycow	: true.
2007-06-19T11:39:00.000Z	kravlin	holycow	I'm trying to resize my / partition. It doesn't like it.
2007-06-19T11:40:00.000Z	kravlin		probably because i'm using it.
2007-06-19T11:40:00.000Z	holycow	kravlin	you said 'create' partition not 'resize partition'
2007-06-19T11:40:00.000Z	kravlin		sorry.
2007-06-19T11:40:00.000Z	holycow	kravlin	with that being said, i hope you have your data back
2007-06-19T11:40:00.000Z	kravlin		i didn't do anything yet holycow'
2007-06-19T11:41:00.000Z	holycow	kravlin	right now i'm too drunk to run you through it, i kinda pointed you in a few directions that are correct you will haveto google the rest i'm afraid
