2011-04-20T19:15:00.000Z	aar	iceroot	I was using kpackagekit rather than the terminal so the error message was very short (just "error installing blah blah"). I just tried again and got a "package already installed error". I did a "java -version" in the terminal and it seems to be installed now.
2011-04-20T19:16:00.000Z	iceroot	aar	dpkg -l packagename  gives ii?
2011-04-20T19:46:00.000Z	aar	iceroot	dpkg -l package name gives:
2011-04-20T19:48:00.000Z	iceroot	aar	then everything is fine
2011-04-20T19:50:00.000Z	aar	iceroot	yes thanks
2011-10-08T23:03:00.000Z	iceroot	aar	make your own encryption software ased
2011-10-08T23:03:00.000Z	aar	iceroot	 I want hardware encryption so I can use it in a broad range of OS without installing software
2011-10-08T23:04:00.000Z	iceroot	aar	? the os needs software to encrypt it, doesnt matter if hardware based or software-based
2011-10-08T23:04:00.000Z	aar	iceroot	check out ironkey, or integral 360.
2011-10-08T23:05:00.000Z	aar	iceroot	my problem is ironkey costs more than a new liver and integral is OS-specific.
2011-10-08T23:05:00.000Z	iceroot	aar	as we said, use software-based encryption
2011-10-08T23:07:00.000Z	aar	iceroot	as i said, i don't want to install new software every time i take my freaking pen drive to my cousin's house and plug it into his BSD, my friend's mac, or aunt tilley's windows.
2011-10-08T23:09:00.000Z	iceroot	aar	then buy a hardware-based solution. whats your question?
2011-10-08T23:09:00.000Z	aar	iceroot	Hi, does anyone know any affordable, linux-compatible usb flash drives with hardware encryption?
2011-10-08T23:10:00.000Z	iceroot	aar	i told you hardware-encryption based need also software on the os site
2011-10-08T23:10:00.000Z	iceroot	aar	you need software on windows, mac, bsd, linux, unix and so on
2011-10-08T23:10:00.000Z	aar	iceroot	no point in starting an argument. read up on ironkey's on the fly hardwar eencryption. thanks.
2011-10-08T23:12:00.000Z	iceroot	aar	the webpage says that it is working with 2.6.x
2011-10-08T23:12:00.000Z	iceroot	aar	so the software-part you need (and i am talking about) is build into 2.6 kernel
2011-10-08T23:13:00.000Z	aar	iceroot	great, sure, you were right, thanks
2011-10-08T23:13:00.000Z	iceroot	aar	so as i said, you need software on os site (which is already build into the kernel)
