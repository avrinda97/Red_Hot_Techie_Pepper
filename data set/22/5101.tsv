2007-07-22T11:42:00.000Z	stuart_		hmm.. amsn does seem to take up a lot of resources, doesn't it
2007-07-22T11:42:00.000Z	triden1	stuart_	Java does that.
2007-07-22T11:43:00.000Z	stuart_	triden1	happen to know any alternatives that still have proper msn support?
2007-07-22T11:44:00.000Z	triden1	stuart_	Unless you truely care for webcam support and the ocassional... custom emotion, Gaim/Pidgin works.
2007-07-22T11:44:00.000Z	stuart_	triden1	Gaim has file send/receive, right?
2007-07-22T11:45:00.000Z	triden1	stuart_	Yep, was sending zips a plenty yesterday.
2007-07-22T11:45:00.000Z	stuart_	triden1	could you get a display pic of yourself up as well?
2007-07-22T11:46:00.000Z	triden1	stuart_	Yup.
2007-07-22T11:46:00.000Z	triden1	stuart_	If you want to test stuff with me, I'll be happy to add you.
2007-07-22T11:47:00.000Z	stuart_	triden1	it's okay, wouldn't wanna trouble you so much, but how'd you set up a display pic in Gaim? i didn't see the option
2007-07-22T11:48:00.000Z	triden1	stuart_	I updated my GAIM to pidgin, let me open my old copy quickly.
2007-07-22T11:49:00.000Z	triden1	stuart_	Bottom right, the little photo thing.
2007-07-22T11:50:00.000Z	stuart_	triden1	upgraded? is pidgin better tehn?
2007-07-22T11:50:00.000Z	triden1	stuart_	Well, it's just that gaim is discontinued, so, I went to pidgin.
2007-07-22T11:52:00.000Z	stuart_	triden1	oh okay. does pidgin show 'MSN nickname quotes' ?
2007-07-22T11:53:00.000Z	triden1	stuart_	I'm pretty sure, you mean that little text under the name? Yeah.
2007-07-22T11:53:00.000Z	stuart_	triden1	k. will get that. so i apt-get install pidgin?
2007-07-22T11:53:00.000Z	triden1	stuart_	Not in the repo yet, you'll have to download it from a website.
2007-07-22T11:54:00.000Z	triden1	stuart_	http://www.getdeb.net/release.php?id=1045
2007-07-22T11:54:00.000Z	stuart_	triden1	kay. thanks.
2007-07-22T11:56:00.000Z	stuart_	triden1	so what do i do with .deb file again? dpkg -i filename?
2007-07-22T11:57:00.000Z	triden1	stuart_	If you download it, GDebi or another package manager should do it.
