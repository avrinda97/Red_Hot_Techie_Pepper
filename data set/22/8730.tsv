2005-10-05T08:10:00.000Z	moshe		quick question:  how do I use grep to search all files in a directory and all of its subdirectories for a string?
2005-10-05T08:10:00.000Z	moshe		grep -r * ?
2005-10-05T08:10:00.000Z	moshe		string in the files
2005-10-05T08:11:00.000Z	moshe		that did it.
2005-10-05T08:11:00.000Z	moshe		good to know
2005-10-05T08:11:00.000Z	moshe		thanks, folks
2005-10-05T08:11:00.000Z	moshe		how's breezy coming?
2005-10-05T08:11:00.000Z	moshe		looking forward to the upgrade
2005-10-05T08:12:00.000Z	moshe		oh, I just remembered a question that's been nagging me
2005-10-05T08:12:00.000Z	moshe		In other distros I've used, switching runlevels will stop X from respawning.  Why doesn't this work in ubuntu?
2005-10-05T08:13:00.000Z	dooglus	moshe	because for some stupid reason gdm is in levels 2 AND 3
2005-10-05T08:13:00.000Z	moshe		I don't want to be in runlevel 1
2005-10-05T08:13:00.000Z	dooglus	moshe	I would suggest taking it out of 2 and making 3 the default (if it isn't already)
2005-10-05T08:13:00.000Z	moshe	wickedpuppy	I know
2005-10-05T08:13:00.000Z	moshe		so, if I went to runlevel four or five that would kill X?
2005-10-05T08:14:00.000Z	dooglus	moshe	try this: echo /etc/rc?.d/???gdm
2005-10-05T08:14:00.000Z	moshe		actually, I'm running kdm
2005-10-05T08:14:00.000Z	moshe		could this be the reason?
2005-10-05T08:14:00.000Z	dooglus	moshe	it'll show you which levels 's'tart gdm, and which 'k'ill it
2005-10-05T08:15:00.000Z	moshe		I installed the system using the kubuntu cd, and then became enamored by xfce
2005-10-05T08:15:00.000Z	moshe		:)
2005-10-05T08:16:00.000Z	dooglus	moshe	it seems that (k)ubuntu just isn't meant to be used from the console.  why else put gdm in both levels 2 and 3
