2010-02-27T03:33:00.000Z	ipatrol_		anyone willing to pick up for me?
2010-02-27T03:33:00.000Z	ipatrol_		on my router issue?
2010-02-27T03:34:00.000Z	dabaR	ipatrol_	what is the issue exactly?
2010-02-27T03:36:00.000Z	dabaR	ipatrol_	why can't you connect?
2010-02-27T03:36:00.000Z	ipatrol_	dabaR	the adapter tries, but it fails at the last second
2010-02-27T03:37:00.000Z	dabaR	ipatrol_	so you can see the access point in the list of avail networks?
2010-02-27T03:37:00.000Z	ipatrol_	dabaR	yes
2010-02-27T03:38:00.000Z	dabaR	ipatrol_	do you have the connection encrypted, or no key?
2010-02-27T03:39:00.000Z	ipatrol_	dabaR	encrypted with key, no password
2010-02-27T03:39:00.000Z	dabaR	ipatrol_	try without encryption, I think that is the only problem.
2010-02-27T03:39:00.000Z	ipatrol_	dabaR	the network is encrypted
2010-02-27T03:42:00.000Z	ipatrol_	dabaR	it's trying
2010-02-27T03:43:00.000Z	ipatrol_	dabaR	it prompted for a 40 bit key but then failed
2010-02-27T03:43:00.000Z	dabaR	ipatrol_	you turned off security, and then it still asked for the key?
2010-02-27T03:43:00.000Z	ipatrol_	dabaR	yes
2010-02-27T03:44:00.000Z	dabaR	ipatrol_	restart wireless, by right clicking the icon in top left
2010-02-27T03:46:00.000Z	ipatrol_	dabaR	it failed again
2010-02-27T03:46:00.000Z	dabaR	ipatrol_	did you try a power cycle of the router?
2010-02-27T03:46:00.000Z	ipatrol_	dabaR	I have tried this for three months
2010-02-27T03:46:00.000Z	ipatrol_	dabaR	it's turned off every night
2010-02-27T03:49:00.000Z	ipatrol_	dabaR	ok
2010-02-27T03:59:00.000Z	ipatrol_	dabaR	it still won't work
