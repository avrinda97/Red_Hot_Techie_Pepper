2006-10-08T06:19:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	andy	of course... installed kde ?
2006-10-08T06:20:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	andy	then kindly install kde -> sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop

2006-10-08T06:23:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	andy	nope
2006-10-08T06:24:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	andy	i am using gnome but burns cd/dvd with k3b ... a kde app .. i don't care which is better
2006-10-08T06:25:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	andy	so then don't forget to get xubuntu too ... its xfce based desktop
