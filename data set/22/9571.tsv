2010-07-12T05:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 it basically has to redownload everything on a cd. so thats 700+mb - and update any extras that may be installed.. so its hard to tell
2010-07-12T06:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 a whole hr! :) Egads...
2010-07-12T06:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 depends on whaart you want to do.
2010-07-28T05:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 depends on whats slow about it.
2010-07-28T05:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 thers no need to PM me.. ask the questions in the channel
2010-07-28T05:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 thats not supriseing..  more ram is always good.
2010-07-28T05:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 or lubuntu instead of xubuntu
2010-07-28T05:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 you need to be a bit more verbose and concise in what you mean  'the same' is meaningless to us..
2010-07-28T05:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 clarify what you mean by 'speed'
2010-07-28T05:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 and whats your cpu?
2010-07-28T05:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 check  the command -->  more /proc/cpuinfo
2010-07-28T05:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 thats not supriseing either.. flash is a big pig.
2010-07-28T06:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 for youtube videos - use the HTML5 feature. instead of flash . that may help
2010-07-28T06:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 you really should look into getting more ram. The stuff is cheap these days
2010-07-29T06:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 for games. one normally uses 'wine'
2010-07-29T06:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 steam is suipposed to be getting released for linux. some time :)
2010-07-29T06:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 you did check the wine appdatabase for that game?
2010-07-29T06:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 we cant really help if the game dosetn work in wine.. we cant make it work.
2010-07-29T06:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bjegovic	 time to grow up? or move to #ubuntu-offtopic then.
