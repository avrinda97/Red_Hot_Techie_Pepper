2008-12-03T00:55:00.000Z	x-kent		in what file can I review the messages I get during the bootime ?
2008-12-03T00:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	x-kent	dmesg
2008-12-03T00:58:00.000Z	x-kent	Jack_Sparrow	some messages aren't there.. is there any other place I can look for ?
2008-12-03T00:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	x-kent	try forming a more complete question and include what version of ubuntu you are using
2008-12-03T00:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	x-kent	grep for EE or ee ?
2008-12-03T01:00:00.000Z	x-kent	Jack_Sparrow	dmesg|grep ee ?
2008-12-03T01:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	x-kent	it might just be seeing a floppy drive and not be of any real importance
2008-12-03T01:02:00.000Z	x-kent	Jack_Sparrow	it's gives a table of some values (I don't have enough time to read it at it continues to boot) and then /dev/sda2 mounted or something, so I think it's related to my filesystem
2008-12-03T01:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	x-kent	I thought you could hit pause..
2008-12-03T01:06:00.000Z	x-kent	Jack_Sparrow	didn't work, I pressed pause many times it still booted without stopping
2008-12-03T01:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	x-kent	Still kinda fuzzy in the am here
2008-12-03T01:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	x-kent	umount before you try and mount
2008-12-03T01:08:00.000Z	x-kent	Jack_Sparrow	 "dmesg|grep clean" didn't report a "/dev/sda1 clean..."  and that message is appears when I boot so seems dmesg does not have all logged or something
2008-12-03T01:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	x-kent	fsck it manually
2008-12-03T01:13:00.000Z	x-kent	Jack_Sparrow	I found when it was comming from, I have /dev/sda4 10gb vfat with XP on it, when I do fsck.vfat /dev/sda4 it says it has differences in boot sector and it can restore it from original or backup the current one, any idea what should I do ?
2008-12-03T01:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	x-kent	scarry..  if the current one does not work you can try the backup, but may I suggest you backup your partition info first
2008-12-03T01:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	x-kent	Backing up the mbr... Go to Terminal.. cd Desktop .... sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=mbr.backup bs=512 count=1   Note: 512 includes all partition info.. Use 446 To exclude partition info... To include the first partition (16 bytes) use 462... Second Partition 478... Third 478... Use hda if needed on your system... copy mbr.backup to a USB Drive (or any media acessible from livecd)
2008-12-03T01:17:00.000Z	x-kent	Jack_Sparrow	if I check the XP and it's ok, may I just decide "backup original" option in order to get rid of that message at boot. Because as far as I know currently everything works fine.
2008-12-03T01:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	x-kent	did you see my post on backing up mbr
2008-12-03T01:18:00.000Z	x-kent	Jack_Sparrow	yep, doing it now
2008-12-03T01:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	x-kent	Restoring the mbr...Insert usb drive...Boot livecd... Copy the mbr.backup from usb to the Desktop...go to Terminal...cd Desktop ... then... dd if=mbr.backup of=/dev/sda bs=1
2008-12-03T01:22:00.000Z	x-kent	Jack_Sparrow	thank you for help, going to check if my XP is still booting, bye. Thanks again.
