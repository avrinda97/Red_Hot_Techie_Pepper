2008-01-29T09:36:00.000Z	soldats		sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2008-01-29T09:36:00.000Z	soldats		will restart gnome
2008-01-29T09:38:00.000Z	spiffman	soldats	thanks, but restarting isn't the issue... gnome refuses to open. If i go through terminal and type xstart, i get "error starting GNOME" and almost nothing works
2008-01-29T09:38:00.000Z	soldats	spiffman	is there any X11 errors or xorg errors
2008-01-29T09:39:00.000Z	spiffman	soldats	just the gnome settings daemon error
2008-01-29T09:39:00.000Z	soldats	spiffman	when did this happen and what were you doing when it happened
2008-01-29T09:40:00.000Z	spiffman	soldats	one time it said that the greeting screen is crashing, another time it kept trying and eventually gave me the ubuntu blue screen of death
2008-01-29T09:41:00.000Z	soldats	spiffman	so are you in terminal right now
2008-01-29T09:45:00.000Z	spiffman	soldats	i also tried deleting some .conf files, but the problem doesn't seem to pertain to configuration... is there a way to salvage it or am i looking at an os reinstall?
2008-01-29T09:46:00.000Z	soldats	spiffman	a nasty solution is to remove gdm via "sudo aptitude remove gdm" then after that do "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg"
2008-01-29T09:47:00.000Z	soldats	spiffman	you might be able to try the second command i gave you first if you want to keet the graphic display manager for the login. otherwise try to remove gdm as well
2008-01-29T09:48:00.000Z	spiffman	soldats	k i uninstalled gdm and tried that other line, but i'm still in the same boat... i'll try a restart and see if anything changes
2008-01-29T09:50:00.000Z	soldats	spiffman	the second command i gave you will attempt to recreate the xorg.conf to something that is useable. so a restart is a must but when you login it will be in textmode until you try startx again
2008-01-29T09:50:00.000Z	spiffman	soldats	gdm uninstall finished successfully, but nothing was fixed...
2008-01-29T09:51:00.000Z	spiffman	soldats	ok i understand what the lines you sent me do, but restarting and doing a new xstart still brings me to the ssame spot
2008-01-29T10:00:00.000Z	spiffman	soldats	i guess it comes down to reinstalling ubuntu... *sigh*... anything else i should try?
2008-01-29T10:01:00.000Z	soldats	spiffman	you could try "sudo apt-get reinstall ubuntu-desktop"
2008-01-29T10:01:00.000Z	spiffman	soldats	that gives me "invalid operation reinstall"
2008-01-29T10:02:00.000Z	soldats	spiffman	maybe "sudo aptitude reinstall ubuntu-desktop"
2008-01-29T10:05:00.000Z	spiffman	soldats	thanks a ton, but i think there are more than a few things messing up, aptitude doesn't even find ubuntu-desktop, nor does it let me install it. i'm going for the reinstall, hooray for coffee!
2008-01-29T10:05:00.000Z	soldats	spiffman	ok man. im sure aptitude should work but i dont remember the name for ubuntu-desktop
2008-01-29T10:07:00.000Z	soldats	spiffman	i guess if nothing else has worked a reinstall should do it
