2008-02-07T02:22:00.000Z	TryingOutLinux		I think my brand new ubuntu is broken! I can't get anything except what camew with it to work!
2008-02-07T02:23:00.000Z	TryingOutLinux		nothing will run
2008-02-07T02:24:00.000Z	TryingOutLinux		i tried all my regular stuff, photoshop, some games, quicktime, itunes, all wont run
2008-02-07T02:26:00.000Z	TryingOutLinux		wait, so nothing you buy in a store will work on linux?!?! SO WHAT THE **** WILL?!
2008-02-07T02:27:00.000Z	TryingOutLinux		so who shells out the money for ubuntu to make the software?
2008-02-07T02:27:00.000Z	DRebellion	TryingOutLinux	the community makes the software!
2008-02-07T02:28:00.000Z	DRebellion	TryingOutLinux	that's because youve seen windows
2008-02-07T02:28:00.000Z	DRebellion	TryingOutLinux	ubuntu isn't just free as in price. it's free as in you can do whatever you want with the source code (the authors do not restrict your rights)
2008-02-07T02:30:00.000Z	DRebellion	TryingOutLinux	ok, so what software do you need?
2008-02-07T02:31:00.000Z	DRebellion	TryingOutLinux	yes. that is the point :)
2008-02-07T02:31:00.000Z	DRebellion	TryingOutLinux	as long as the people who modify it and release it allow others to do the same.
2008-02-07T02:32:00.000Z	DRebellion	TryingOutLinux	YES
2008-02-07T02:33:00.000Z	DRebellion	TryingOutLinux	companies make money off it by selling corporate support (eg 24/7 phoneline etc)
2008-02-07T02:35:00.000Z	DRebellion	TryingOutLinux	yep, as long as you provide the source code.
2008-02-07T02:36:00.000Z	DRebellion	TryingOutLinux	nah, you don't need a shell ;) init will just sleep
2008-02-07T02:36:00.000Z	DRebellion	TryingOutLinux	at least give linux a chance. you'll come to love it.
2008-02-07T02:38:00.000Z	DRebellion	TryingOutLinux	don't try wine first. try native linux programs first.
2008-02-07T02:38:00.000Z	DRebellion	TryingOutLinux	no, it is BETA
2008-02-07T02:39:00.000Z	DRebellion	TryingOutLinux	you can install new software using   system -> adminstration -> synaptic package manager
2008-02-07T02:40:00.000Z	DRebellion	TryingOutLinux	don't use add/remove (it is way inferior to syaptic)
