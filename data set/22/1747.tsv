2010-03-17T22:57:00.000Z	Trek	ipatrol	explain your wireless issues to me here, and tell the Windows guy to stop recommending windows because you want to use *nix
2010-03-17T22:57:00.000Z	ipatrol	Trek	My wife decides, and she doesnt care either way
2010-03-17T22:58:00.000Z	Trek	ipatrol	regardless, details about your wireless issues, please
2010-03-17T22:59:00.000Z	ipatrol	Trek	Iwconfig shows the adapter as working, mabye the drivers are imperfect?

2010-03-17T23:00:00.000Z	ipatrol	Trek	Network manager
2010-03-17T23:01:00.000Z	Trek	ipatrol	interesting, haven't had that happen before, you tried rebooting the router to see if its a router-side issue?
2010-03-17T23:01:00.000Z	Trek	ipatrol	reboot as in unplug the router/modem for a minute, plug it back in
2010-03-17T23:01:00.000Z	ipatrol	Trek	Ive tried for months
2010-03-17T23:01:00.000Z	Trek	ipatrol	what wifi card?

2010-03-18T00:31:00.000Z	Trek	ipatrol	is it possible your router is denying Linux connections?
2010-03-18T00:31:00.000Z	ipatrol	Trek	Why?
2010-03-18T00:32:00.000Z	Trek	ipatrol	some routers and things dont like nix
2010-03-18T00:33:00.000Z	ipatrol	Trek	Would linksys do that on purpose?
2010-03-18T00:33:00.000Z	Trek	ipatrol	not sure, might be a glitch in the hardware's files, but i'm not super-familiar with Linksys
