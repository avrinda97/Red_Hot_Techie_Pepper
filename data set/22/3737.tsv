2008-06-11T00:26:00.000Z	Cliph		Hi, I'm building a meta-dpkg and it has a bunch of dependencies that are also available in my repository, when I try installing <my-meta-package> I get a message about some of my dependencies stating "Depends: <other dependency> but it is not going to be installed"
2008-06-11T00:26:00.000Z	Cliph		I don't understand this message
2008-06-11T00:26:00.000Z	Cliph		Here is a pastebin of the output and my control file: http://pastebin.com/d1efb6512
2008-06-11T00:26:00.000Z	Cliph		And here is a pastebin of apt-cache policy <my-meta-package>: http://pastebin.com/d7e10ae2b

2008-06-11T00:27:00.000Z	wols_	Cliph	you don't use apt to install your own packages. use dpkg
2008-06-11T00:28:00.000Z	Cliph	wols_	I do, I have my own apt repository for this
2008-06-11T00:28:00.000Z	wols_	Cliph	then it's not set up properly
2008-06-11T00:28:00.000Z	Cliph	wols_	that would seem to be the case, it works in all other cases, and my metapackages were working previously, so I don't understand the message
2008-06-11T00:29:00.000Z	wols_	Cliph	your new packages are NOT in your repo.end of story. either you put them in or you use dpkg, your choice
2008-06-11T00:29:00.000Z	wols_	Cliph	and next time come here DIRECTLY
2008-06-11T00:29:00.000Z	wols_	Cliph	fiddle util apt-cache policy shows a candidate from your repo
2008-06-11T00:29:00.000Z	Cliph	wols_	yes, my debian packages are in the relevant distro of my repository, I know this bwecause I created the new distro
2008-06-11T00:30:00.000Z	Cliph	wols_	look at my output, it does show it
2008-06-11T00:30:00.000Z	wols_	Cliph	it's not the meta package that has to be in ther. ALL, including dependencies have to be
2008-06-11T00:30:00.000Z	Cliph	wols_	all of my packages are in the repository
2008-06-11T00:30:00.000Z	wols_	Cliph	and the -gui policy output you showed me DID NOT have it as a candidate
2008-06-11T00:31:00.000Z	wols_	Cliph	apt-cache policy output for the -gui one then
2008-06-11T00:31:00.000Z	Cliph	wols_	http://pastebin.com/d775b6e79
2008-06-11T00:32:00.000Z	wols_	Cliph	and you still get http://pastebin.com/d3ff76a8b ?
2008-06-11T00:33:00.000Z	Cliph	wols_	yes
2008-06-11T00:33:00.000Z	wols_	Cliph	I actually don't believe you. ask someone else
