2009-04-19T03:24:00.000Z	Slart	Ben90	chmod and chown are used for changing ownership and permissions, respectively
2009-04-19T03:26:00.000Z	Slart	Ben90	I think it's chown ben /path/to/your/folder ..
2009-04-19T03:27:00.000Z	Slart	Ben90	you might need to put a sudo in fron of it too
2009-04-20T11:05:00.000Z	Slart	Ben90	a special part of a partition/drive that holds information about the drive/partition?
2009-04-20T11:07:00.000Z	Slart	Ben90	sounds like something is wrong with your hard drive
2009-04-20T11:08:00.000Z	Slart	Ben90	but that's just a guess.. have you tried checking the s.m.a.r.t info?
2009-04-20T11:09:00.000Z	Slart	Ben90	there is a command.. smartctl I think
2009-04-20T11:17:00.000Z	Slart	Ben90	yes?
2009-04-20T11:19:00.000Z	Slart	Ben90	hmm.. there are some errors in that report.. try making it run a self-test and see what it says
2009-04-20T11:28:00.000Z	Ben90	Slart	go to http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d65560732
2009-04-20T11:29:00.000Z	Ben90	Slart	it more about my 60 gb hdd.
2009-04-20T11:30:00.000Z	Slart	Ben90	hmm.. seems s.m.a.r.t didn't find any errors.. odd
2009-04-20T11:33:00.000Z	Slart	Ben90	no matter what s.m.a.r.t says I would say it's broken.. time to get a new one?
2009-04-20T11:33:00.000Z	Slart	Ben90	bye
