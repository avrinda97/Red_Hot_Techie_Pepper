2006-04-13T08:59:00.000Z	_mark	_jason	could that be why my modem is not working cuz the driver is in rpm form I had to convert it and then install it
2006-04-13T08:59:00.000Z	_jason	_mark	maybe, have you seen the ubuntu wiki on dialup?
2006-04-13T09:00:00.000Z	_mark	_jason	no is it big?
2006-04-13T09:00:00.000Z	_jason	_mark	you probably want to give yourself about an hour if you haven't done it before
2006-04-13T09:02:00.000Z	_mark	_jason	ok but I don't think its ganna help I have a winmodem and its only source as far as a driver is in the rpm pkg
2006-04-13T09:02:00.000Z	_jason	_mark	I think the dialup page covers most brands, you should take a look
2006-04-13T09:03:00.000Z	_mark	_jason	reading now thanks
2006-04-13T09:29:00.000Z	_mark	_jason	why does gedit not open a makefile from prompt but will from gui ?
2006-04-13T09:29:00.000Z	_jason	_mark	what command are you using?
2006-04-13T09:29:00.000Z	_mark	_jason	prompt I'm in root so I can rewrite it gui I'm in user
2006-04-13T09:30:00.000Z	_mark	_jason	gedit
2006-04-13T09:30:00.000Z	_jason	_mark	huh?
2006-04-13T09:30:00.000Z	_mark	_jason	sorry I was slow on that follow up
2006-04-13T09:31:00.000Z	_jason	_mark	well what happens when you try to open it?
2006-04-13T09:31:00.000Z	_mark	_jason	Authentication Rejected, reason : None of the authentication protocols specified are supported and host-based authentication failed.
2006-04-13T09:32:00.000Z	_jason	_mark	you get that just from the exact command 'gedit' ?
2006-04-13T09:33:00.000Z	_mark	_jason	gedit makefile
2006-04-13T09:34:00.000Z	_jason	_mark	it's usually Makefile with a capital M ?  but I don't know why you get that Authentication rejected thing
2006-04-13T09:35:00.000Z	_jason	_mark	are you doing this as root after sudo -i or something?
2006-04-13T09:35:00.000Z	_mark	_jason	lol sorry I missed the capital M thats the problem
2006-04-15T07:38:00.000Z	_mark	_jason	turns out that modem I was tryin to get woring was a dead modem : \
2006-04-15T07:38:00.000Z	_jason	_mark	yeah that makes it tough :P
