2005-11-04T12:28:00.000Z	jeremy913226		Hi - I've install boot-up-manager, but where do I find it to run it?
2005-11-04T12:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	jeremy913226	maybe 'system -> admin' ?
2005-11-04T12:28:00.000Z	jeremy913226	HappyFool	: Thanks :) (n00b)
2005-11-04T12:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	jeremy913226	'dpkg -L proftpd' to try to find it
2005-11-04T12:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	jeremy913226	maybe you're expected to create it
2005-11-04T12:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	jeremy913226	stand by
2005-11-04T12:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	jeremy913226	hm. according to this: http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?word=proftpd.conf&searchmode=searchfiles&case=insensitive&version=breezy&arch=i386
2005-11-04T12:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	jeremy913226	/etc/proftpd.conf is *not* put in /etc
2005-11-04T12:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	jeremy913226	unless maybe it's done by a debconf script
2005-11-04T12:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	jeremy913226	ah-ha. have you tried 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure proftpd' ?
2005-11-04T12:55:00.000Z	jeremy913226	HappyFool	nope?
2005-11-04T12:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	jeremy913226	see if that gives you any configuration options
2005-11-04T12:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	jeremy913226	alternatively, just create the file yourself
2005-11-04T12:56:00.000Z	jeremy913226	HappyFool	:0 -proftpd is not installed!!
2005-11-04T12:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	jeremy913226	ah-ha
2005-11-04T12:56:00.000Z	jeremy913226	HappyFool	:'(
2005-11-04T12:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	jeremy913226	so install it ;)
2005-11-04T12:57:00.000Z	jeremy913226	HappyFool	I always get E: could not find package xxxx or somesuch
2005-11-04T13:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	jeremy913226	put your /etc/apt/sources.list up on the pastebin
2005-11-04T13:31:00.000Z	jeremy913226	HappyFool	to install proftpd for a lampp install, do i want a standalone install or inetd install?
2005-11-04T13:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	jeremy913226	standalone is probably simpler, but i don't know what's best
2005-11-04T13:35:00.000Z	jeremy913226	HappyFool	thanks, I'll do that. I already have the xampp install, just minus fpt (i had a fpt daemon running during the xampp install)
