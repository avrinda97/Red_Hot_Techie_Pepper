2005-07-10T06:22:00.000Z	chrissturm	bluefoxicy	did you try purging the package?
2005-07-10T06:23:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	chrissturm	 Yes, I tried dpkg removal, forced removal, apt-get --purge, a dpkg command that purged all info. . .
2005-07-10T06:23:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	chrissturm	 I tried manually editing the dpkg database and removing the package's entry
2005-07-10T06:23:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	chrissturm	 it's stored info somewhere I can't find.
2005-07-10T06:24:00.000Z	chrissturm	bluefoxicy	i also think so
2005-07-10T06:24:00.000Z	chrissturm	bluefoxicy	sure, thats why its not good to install unsigned packags
2005-07-10T06:25:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	chrissturm	 Is that a proper attitude?
2005-07-10T06:25:00.000Z	chrissturm	bluefoxicy	its not technically possible to protect from these problems
2005-07-10T06:25:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	chrissturm	 In Gentoo installing a package doesn't have any effect until the final installation stage.  Up to then the package is inable to touch the rest of the system.
2005-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	chrissturm	bluefoxicy	and in the final stage it can rm -rf / if it wants to
2005-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	chrissturm	 Further, Portage tracks _ALL_ changes made by a package's installation process, allowing you to remove it.
2005-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	chrissturm	 nope.  The package cannot remove anything during install, only after first run.
2005-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	chrissturm	bluefoxicy	thats not possible
2005-07-10T06:27:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	chrissturm	 Yes it is.  the glibc functions for open(), unlink(), creat(), and the like are overridden with a library called sandbox, which allows (read, write, readwrite, none) to be set for specified paths and endures through exec() calls.
2005-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	chrissturm	bluefoxicy	think about it this way:  most stuff that portage does happens on the ubuntu build servers. the last stage of a portage install is comparable to the whole install when using debs
2005-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	chrissturm	bluefoxicy	i know gentoo quite well
2005-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	chrissturm	 dpkg allows for preinst scripts to be run.
2005-07-10T06:29:00.000Z	chrissturm	bluefoxicy	try stracing dpkg :)
2005-07-10T06:29:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	chrissturm	 i tried that as well :(  I also read the preinstall script.
2005-07-10T06:31:00.000Z	chrissturm	bluefoxicy	write a mail to the blackdown ML.
2005-07-10T06:32:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	chrissturm	Yes, I should ask the blackdown people why in the hell debian packages can make changes that debian's package manager doesn't know how to undo before they're even installed.
2005-07-10T06:34:00.000Z	chrissturm	bluefoxicy	that shows that you dont want a solution, but only bitch around
