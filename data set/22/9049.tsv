2005-04-04T07:43:00.000Z	Roey	geppy	 packages are missing all over the place
2005-04-04T07:43:00.000Z	geppy	Roey	 Hoary is coming out in a couple of weeks, they can't add anything new.
2005-04-04T07:43:00.000Z	Roey	geppy	 so they're going to leave it broken like this?

2005-04-04T07:43:00.000Z	Roey	geppy	 xmms doesn't really work

2005-04-04T07:44:00.000Z	Roey	geppy	 kubuntu is just a set of packages, it's still ubuntu
2005-04-04T07:44:00.000Z	geppy	Roey	XMMS works fine for me.
