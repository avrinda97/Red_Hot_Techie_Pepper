2012-05-10T02:50:00.000Z	bjoessi		is anyone in the mood to help me setting up my laptop as internet gateway (internet sharing)
2012-05-10T02:52:00.000Z	bjoessi		i just installed 12.04 and now all my settings for internet sharing from my previous install is lost... I would really appreciate some help restoring my gateway
2012-05-10T02:52:00.000Z	bjoessi		anyone?
2012-05-10T02:53:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	bjoessi	do you remember (or have a copy of) how you set it up last time?
2012-05-10T02:54:00.000Z	bjoessi	DarwinSurvivor	I am afraid not... if I did I believe that I would be able to solve it on my own...
2012-05-10T02:56:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor		loop-: what do you need the library for?
2012-05-10T02:57:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor		loop-: sorry, he left and auto-complete changed :(
2012-05-10T02:59:00.000Z	bjoessi		Ok, perhaps I should get to the point what I need trouble shooting for: I have set my wlan connection as "Shared with other computers", but when I connect the eth2 where the client is, I loose internet access
2012-05-10T03:00:00.000Z	bjoessi		the eth2 is connected to a router on its wan port
2012-05-10T03:01:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	bjoessi	please describe your routing (ex: client computer wan => ubuntu wan -> ubuntu lan => router lan -> router wan => internet)
2012-05-10T03:03:00.000Z	bjoessi		*the internet* -> router -> this computer wlan2 -> this computer eth2 -> router
2012-05-10T03:04:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	bjoessi	so you are connnecting 2 routers together?
2012-05-10T03:04:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	bjoessi	using your ubuntu box?
2012-05-10T03:05:00.000Z	bjoessi	DarwinSurvivor	 I am trying to extend the wifi another building, but the signal is weak from the first router
2012-05-10T03:05:00.000Z	bjoessi		so behind the second router is where I plan to connect the clients in this building
2012-05-10T03:07:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	bjoessi	http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Repeater_Bridge may work, but I don't think you'll get wifi off the third router
2012-05-10T03:07:00.000Z	bjoessi	DarwinSurvivor	But the annoying thing is that it worked just fine before
2012-05-10T03:08:00.000Z	bjoessi		and I haven
2012-05-10T03:08:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	bjoessi	you would either need 1) a router with dual antenas, which are not that expensive 2) a third router to plug into the second 3) just use wired clients on the second router
2012-05-10T03:08:00.000Z	bjoessi		and I havent changed anything in the router
2012-05-10T03:08:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	bjoessi	do you need wirelss at the secondary location?
2012-05-10T03:09:00.000Z	bjoessi	DarwinSurvivor	not crucial, but since I did have it before I kind of got used to it
