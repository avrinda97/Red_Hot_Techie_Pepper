2009-09-27T01:32:00.000Z	puff	userone	well, one easy way to do it would be to use the openssl package.
2009-09-27T01:33:00.000Z	puff	userone	openssl bf -salt -in inputfile.txt -out outputfile.txt
2009-09-27T01:34:00.000Z	puff	userone	It will prompt you for a passphrase;  you can also specify the passphrase with a command-line option, but then of course the passphrase is in your shell history :-)
2009-09-27T01:35:00.000Z	userone	puff	what you are suggesting sounds interesting. so this would allow me to password protect any type of file, and not just openoffice ones?
2009-09-27T01:37:00.000Z	userone	puff	I am using ubuntu on my laptop
2009-09-27T01:40:00.000Z	userone	puff	so does that mean I can use it to password protect any file?
2009-09-27T01:40:00.000Z	puff	userone	 Yes.
2009-09-27T01:41:00.000Z	puff	userone	Any file, just as the example I just gave.
2009-09-27T01:41:00.000Z	puff	userone	It's actually possible to do tricksier things, I've read, but I haven't tried.
2009-09-27T01:42:00.000Z	puff	userone	Also note that this doesn't necessarily protect you against disk recovery, etc, so it's not super-secure.
2009-09-27T01:43:00.000Z	userone	puff	thats fine..I just wanted to protect the files while they are on my laptop. the original files are in a secure server
2009-09-27T01:44:00.000Z	puff	userone	I've heard good things about truecrypt, but I haven't explored it yet.
2009-09-27T01:45:00.000Z	userone	puff	out of interest, can you explain what the bf -salt -in bit of the command is doing?
2009-09-27T01:46:00.000Z	puff	userone	 Well you could even encrypt them on the server, before downloading htem.
2009-09-27T01:58:00.000Z	userone	puff	can you explain what the bf -salt -in bit does in your suggestion?
2009-09-27T01:59:00.000Z	puff	userone	bf is the code for the type of encryption yo're going to use, blowfish, which from what I've read is the recommended one to go wtih if you don't know what you're doing.
2009-09-27T02:00:00.000Z	puff	userone	Blowfish was invented by Bruce Schneier, the god of computer security, and is generally regarded as pretty sedure.
2009-09-27T02:00:00.000Z	puff	userone	-salt is a flag that really ought to be on by default, again, always use it if you don't know what you're doing.
2009-09-27T02:02:00.000Z	puff	userone	 In a nutshell an encryption salt is part of the inputs to encryption. Using a good salt value makes the encryption stronger (i.e. less predicatble and therefore harder to deduce the key), but also makes it take more resources.
2009-09-27T02:02:00.000Z	puff	userone	"-in inputfilename.txt" and "-out outputfilename.txt" are pretty self-explanatory.
2009-09-27T02:03:00.000Z	userone	puff	yes...I understood that part! :-)
2009-09-27T02:03:00.000Z	userone	puff	thanks for your help with encryption
