2006-11-05T09:05:00.000Z	SeaD		Hi all, i need help installing Ubuntu trough a netboot image. Is it possible to setup a local mirror, because the ubuntu setup want's to access the internet and download the needed files from there. I dont'have a Internet connection on that networl... any suggestions?
2006-11-05T09:06:00.000Z	penguin42	SeaD	I'd have thought you could do it with a mirror - but I'm not sure how; have you considered installing on another machine somewhere more convenient than installing the image with partimage or the like?
2006-11-05T09:09:00.000Z	penguin42	SeaD	How do you mean as a cdrom?
2006-11-05T09:10:00.000Z	SeaD	penguin42	i want to map or mount a map like (hd0,0)/ubuntu from my hdd as a CD-ROM device... is this possible? Cus, my machine does not have a CD-ROM device
2006-11-05T09:11:00.000Z	penguin42	SeaD	Sorry I'm confused - are you saying your files in a directory or in a .iso file?
2006-11-05T09:12:00.000Z	SeaD	penguin42	i've coppied the CD files on a HDD in C:\ubuntu\
2006-11-05T09:12:00.000Z	penguin42	SeaD	Ah I don't think you can do that
2006-11-05T09:31:00.000Z	penguin42	SeaD	Yeh should do - but I'm also fairly sure you can tell VMWare to present the disc as IDE
2006-11-05T09:32:00.000Z	SeaD	penguin42	nope, not possible...
2006-11-05T09:33:00.000Z	SeaD	penguin42	i use the workstation version :)
2006-11-05T09:33:00.000Z	penguin42	SeaD	Ah I've not tried Workstation in ages
2006-11-05T09:34:00.000Z	SeaD	penguin42	but is it also possible to solve the problem in GRUB by changing the root params?
2006-11-05T09:34:00.000Z	penguin42	SeaD	Yeh you should just be able to change it to /dev/hda?  and with edgy because it uses UUIDs I don't even think you'll have to change your fstab
2006-11-05T09:35:00.000Z	SeaD	penguin42	so root=/dev/hda should do the work?
2006-11-05T09:35:00.000Z	penguin42	SeaD	No, if it was sda1 then hda1 should do it
2006-11-05T09:37:00.000Z	SeaD	penguin42	i tried that too, (root=/dev/hda1) bot still kernel panic
2006-11-05T09:37:00.000Z	penguin42	SeaD	Ah
2006-11-05T09:39:00.000Z	SeaD	penguin42	suggestions??? A How-to on installing Ubuntu trough a ISO from local HDD (Partiotion 2 D:\) can help me too... ;)
2006-11-05T09:41:00.000Z	penguin42	SeaD	I'm not sure to be honest - I'd start with the alternate CD, probably copy the contents out of the ISO onto your hard disc as a directory, use that GRUB trick to boot the installer and then point the installer to get it its files off the hard disc
2006-11-05T09:44:00.000Z	SeaD	penguin42	that's exactly what i did, but the setup asks for a cd later. that's the problem. if there is a way to point a map on the HDD where i loaded the setup from as a CD-device then that will do the work, but i don't know if i can mount a HDD MAP as a CD device trough grub. or trough the ubuntu setup by using the console. suggestions?
2006-11-05T09:45:00.000Z	penguin42	SeaD	Are you sure you are using the alternate CD (and told it to use the mounted hard disc?) - I'd hope it didn't try and get a CD - but if it does I'm not sure of a fix
2006-11-05T09:47:00.000Z	SeaD	penguin42	how to tell the setup to use the mounted HDD and not the CD-device?
