2007-01-02T07:36:00.000Z	dooglus		ok, so now I know what it is, how can I get the center speaker to work?
2007-01-02T07:37:00.000Z	jasin	dooglus	sounds like you got things hooked up wrong because it should just work.
2007-01-02T07:38:00.000Z	dooglus	jasin	I didn't hook anything up, I just installed from a CD
2007-01-02T07:38:00.000Z	dooglus	jasin	it's the same if I install debian, too
2007-01-02T07:38:00.000Z	jasin	dooglus	speakers have to be hooked up
2007-01-02T07:38:00.000Z	dooglus	jasin	it's a laptop
2007-01-02T07:38:00.000Z	jasin	dooglus	I see.
2007-01-02T07:38:00.000Z	dooglus	jasin	the speakers are built in
2007-01-02T07:39:00.000Z	dooglus	jasin	there's a sub-woofer on the bottom of the case
2007-01-02T07:39:00.000Z	jasin	dooglus	nice, what kind of laptop is this?
2007-01-02T07:39:00.000Z	dooglus	jasin	it's http://www.funponsel.com/blog/archives/2006/06/24/asus-w1j-laptop-with-integrated-tv-tuner/
2007-01-02T07:39:00.000Z	jasin	dooglus	do as they are saying, make sure alsa is installed and working properly, make sure its enabled if its already installed.
2007-01-02T07:39:00.000Z	jasin	dooglus	sounds heavy
2007-01-02T07:40:00.000Z	dooglus	jasin	it's quite light.  the case is carbon fibre I think
2007-01-02T07:41:00.000Z	jasin	dooglus	nice :)
2007-01-02T07:41:00.000Z	dooglus	jasin	both left and right speakers work with alsa, esd, arts, oss or whatever else I try.  but the volume control is labelled 'front', rather than 'pcm' which I'm used to seeing on other installs
2007-01-02T07:42:00.000Z	dooglus	jasin	the fact that it knows there's a "front" speaker makes me think it's somehow just got it's "wires crossed"
2007-01-02T07:48:00.000Z	jasin	dooglus	could be but I bet its something funny like how you got the speakers confiqured
2007-01-02T07:48:00.000Z	dooglus	jasin	I've not got the speakers configured - they're inside the case, and I can't get to them at all
2007-01-02T07:50:00.000Z	jasin	dooglus	naw, how you have them confiqured in linux, I bet you need ti enabe full duplex and surround sound.
2007-01-02T07:51:00.000Z	dooglus	jasin	heh, ok, I'll do that then.
2007-01-02T07:52:00.000Z	jasin	dooglus	try like rain said, that should force alsa
