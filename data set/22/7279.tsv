2006-05-04T11:02:00.000Z	COMMAND_		What do you mean?
2006-05-04T11:03:00.000Z	LinuxJones	COMMAND_	you going to be using windows machines to access the backup server ?
2006-05-04T11:04:00.000Z	LinuxJones	COMMAND_	you'll probably want to run samba so your client machines can connect to the server.
2006-05-04T11:05:00.000Z	COMMAND_	LinuxJones	I'm totally new to this.
2006-05-04T11:05:00.000Z	LinuxJones	COMMAND_	samba allows microsoft, mac, linux machines to share files.
2006-05-04T11:06:00.000Z	COMMAND_	LinuxJones	Samba, huh? Google it?
2006-05-04T11:07:00.000Z	LinuxJones	COMMAND_	there are howto's all over the place, best to find one for Ubuntu though
2006-05-04T11:07:00.000Z	COMMAND_	LinuxJones	Just google it?
2006-05-04T11:08:00.000Z	LinuxJones	COMMAND_	or you can search the ubuntu website as well
2006-05-04T11:08:00.000Z	COMMAND_	LinuxJones	I've done that. I still ahve to try some of those things.
2006-05-04T11:09:00.000Z	COMMAND_	LinuxJones	Do I need a fresh install?
2006-05-04T11:10:00.000Z	LinuxJones	COMMAND_	no if you have ubuntu installed already you can simply install the software by doing sudo apt-get install samba
2006-05-04T11:11:00.000Z	COMMAND_	LinuxJones	Ok, cool. Do I need any software on my other computers (Windows and Mac) to be able to access it? They're all connected via a router.
2006-05-04T11:12:00.000Z	LinuxJones	COMMAND_	they should be able to talk once samba is set up.
2006-05-04T11:12:00.000Z	COMMAND_	LinuxJones	Awesome. Can I also connect to it from another computer outside the LAN?
2006-05-04T11:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	COMMAND_	you don't want to open your samba server over the web, you normally would ssh or vpn into your network and access the files over an encrypted connection.
2006-05-04T11:14:00.000Z	COMMAND_	LinuxJones	Ok. Sounds good. What's the best tutorial in your opinion? Is it buried somewhere in the Ubuntu site?
2006-05-04T11:22:00.000Z	LinuxJones	COMMAND_	here's a good place to start >> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SettingUpSamba?highlight=%28samba%29
