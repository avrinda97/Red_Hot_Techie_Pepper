2011-02-24T13:06:00.000Z	usr13_	mickster04	Did you try --fix-missing
2011-02-24T13:06:00.000Z	mickster04	usr13_	yeah i appended that to the update, upgrade and install calls i made
2011-02-24T13:06:00.000Z	usr13_	mickster04	What command did you use?
2011-02-24T13:07:00.000Z	mickster04	usr13_	sudo apt-get update (or upgrade) --fix-missing
2011-02-24T13:07:00.000Z	mickster04	usr13_	and i also did sudo apt=get install vlc --fix-missing
2011-02-24T13:07:00.000Z	usr13_	mickster04	Yes, the error is from the server itself "You don't have permission to access /ubuntu/pool/universe/libc/libcdio/libiso9660-7_0.81-4_amd64.deb on this server"
2011-02-24T13:08:00.000Z	usr13_	mickster04	So, not much we can do about that...

2011-02-24T13:08:00.000Z	usr13_	mickster04	What is it that you are doing?
2011-02-24T13:09:00.000Z	mickster04	usr13_	i changed the repos from the NZ ones to the Main ones need to reload everything in synaptics :D
2011-02-24T13:17:00.000Z	usr13_	mickster04	apt-get update  #Should resynchronize the package index files from their sources
2011-02-24T13:18:00.000Z	mickster04	usr13_	yeah it didn't
2011-02-24T13:18:00.000Z	usr13_	mickster04	Yes, the error is from the server itself "You don't have permission to access /ubuntu/pool/universe/libc/libcdio/libiso9660-7_0.81-4_amd64.deb on this server"netstat -pantu
