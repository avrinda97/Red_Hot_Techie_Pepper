2009-12-08T23:16:00.000Z	sj4m35-15		walkabouting:why would you do that?
2009-12-08T23:17:00.000Z	walkabouting	sj4m35-15	work
2009-12-08T23:17:00.000Z	sj4m35-15		you mean one for work one for play?
2009-12-08T23:18:00.000Z	sj4m35-15		walkabouting:could you just set up another profile in xp?
2009-12-08T23:18:00.000Z	walkabouting	sj4m35-15	basically
2009-12-08T23:18:00.000Z	walkabouting	sj4m35-15	no, I need to periodically format windows - it gets bloated in ~3months. its more one for work, one for testing
2009-12-08T23:19:00.000Z	sj4m35-15		walkabouting:so that when it boots it'll give you an option to either boot into work or play?
2009-12-08T23:19:00.000Z	walkabouting	sj4m35-15	yes - stable xp, testing xp, or linux
2009-12-08T23:20:00.000Z	sj4m35-15	walkabouting	how about virtualbox?
2009-12-08T23:20:00.000Z	walkabouting	sj4m35-15	too slow
2009-12-08T23:20:00.000Z	sj4m35-15	walkabouting	what are your system specs?
2009-12-08T23:20:00.000Z	walkabouting	sj4m35-15	it shouldnt be *that* hard - I could do it in grub, but grub2 is way too confusing
2009-12-08T23:21:00.000Z	sj4m35-15	walkabouting	try adding more ram.
