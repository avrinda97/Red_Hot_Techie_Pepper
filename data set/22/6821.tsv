2006-07-19T12:45:00.000Z	sharms	Pandora82	what is your issue
2006-07-19T12:46:00.000Z	Pandora82	sharms	the damn DVDs... ;-)
2006-07-19T12:46:00.000Z	sharms	Pandora82	explain the issue to me in a clear, concise manner
2006-07-19T12:47:00.000Z	Pandora82	sharms	sorry. I can't open/ watch DVDs. I can't mount them, when I doubleclick the devide it says "no medium found" even there is a proper working DVD inside.
2006-07-19T12:47:00.000Z	sharms	Pandora82	it was already explained to you that you don't mount them
2006-07-19T12:48:00.000Z	Pandora82	sharms	but how do I get to watch the movie on the dvd?
2006-07-19T12:48:00.000Z	sharms	Pandora82	and the link I sent you, https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html, explained that.
2006-07-19T12:50:00.000Z	sharms	Pandora82	did you install libdvdread3 and activate it
2006-07-19T12:52:00.000Z	Pandora82	sharms	I think so - with sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh
2006-07-19T12:53:00.000Z	sharms	Pandora82	run this: sudo aptitude install libxine-main1 libxine-extracodecs
2006-07-19T12:55:00.000Z	sharms	Pandora82	open with gxine and see what happens
2006-07-19T13:00:00.000Z	Pandora82	sharms	maybe take a look at this? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/18375
2006-07-19T13:02:00.000Z	sharms	Pandora82	it looks like it doesn't have permissions, run it using sudo and see what happens
2006-07-19T13:03:00.000Z	Pandora82	sharms	same error with no permissions, missing input-plugin
2006-07-19T13:04:00.000Z	sharms	Pandora82	in paste bin put the output of 'dmesg | grep hd' and 'ls -la /dev/dvd'
2006-07-19T13:07:00.000Z	sharms	Pandora82	it looks to me like your dvd rom driver is broken or has a problem with it
2006-07-19T13:08:00.000Z	Pandora82	sharms	driver sounds interesting! but since I'm a newbie: how do I get the right driver for my DVD-player?
2006-07-19T13:09:00.000Z	sharms	Pandora82	well if the dvd drive is 100% working it may just be you need to turn DMA on or off, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DMA
2006-07-19T13:10:00.000Z	Pandora82	sharms	I think DMA is on - at least automatixx said that
2006-07-19T13:10:00.000Z	sharms	Pandora82	you might want to turn it off then, maybe your drive doesn't support it
2006-07-19T13:10:00.000Z	Pandora82	sharms	I'll try
2006-07-19T13:35:00.000Z	sharms	Pandora82	I believe it is a hardware issue that your dvd drive is broken.
