2011-03-30T13:20:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	with?
2011-03-30T13:21:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	Do you have init in your /sbin folder?
2011-03-30T13:25:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	I think you screwed up your filesystem. Try to repair it with fsck
2011-03-30T13:27:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	Or you can just use a Live CD to boot
2011-03-30T13:27:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	then mount your disk. Then copy init file from live cd to your /sbin/
2011-03-30T13:28:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	Download it then :D
2011-03-30T13:30:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	maybe 600MB?
2011-03-30T13:30:00.000Z	Lew	fairuz	link to LiveCD?
2011-03-30T13:31:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	I think your problem is just a missing init from /sbin
2011-03-30T13:32:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	maybe it's not the only way, but it's the way that I would go
2011-03-30T13:35:00.000Z	Lew	fairuz	will I loose my files and stuff if I use LiveCD
2011-03-30T13:36:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	Of course not! I'm not asking you to reinstall Ubuntu
2011-03-30T13:36:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	Don't reinstall Ubuntu
2011-03-30T13:36:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	just boot from the CD
2011-03-30T14:49:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	so you are now on CD?
2011-03-30T15:53:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	any luck with ubuntu CD?
2011-03-30T15:57:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	Yes
2011-03-30T16:00:00.000Z	fairuz	Lew	Do you know where your filesystem is mounted?
2011-03-30T16:17:00.000Z	Lew	fairuz	msg me
