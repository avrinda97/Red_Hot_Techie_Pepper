2008-04-30T14:52:00.000Z	end-user	Jazman_brewer	Well, if you are looking for something deeper than Rhythmbox for music, Amarok is popular
2008-04-30T14:54:00.000Z	end-user	Jazman_brewer	well as for photoshop, I guess all I can recommend is The Gimp. For Nero, I guess it sort of depends on your CD burning needs. I mean, much of it is very intuitive. For example, Windows, you needed to use Nero to burn the .iso, while here you'd just right click the file and burn to disc.
2008-04-30T14:55:00.000Z	end-user	Jazman_brewer	For audio CD's, you can either simply use your given music player, or Brasero Disc Burning
2008-04-30T14:56:00.000Z	end-user	Jazman_brewer	Brasero is under Sound and video
2008-04-30T14:58:00.000Z	end-user	Jazman_brewer	Sorry :( I must admit I don't do a ton of burning myself. However, typing dvd shrink in Add/Remove brought up a program called Dvd95 converter - does that seem to have some utilities you could use?
2008-04-30T15:03:00.000Z	end-user	Jazman_brewer	I hope that one works for you - yeah, they do cover a ton of bases. And Add/Remove is really friendly with experimenting with programs, I mean, you can just sample a ton of programs really fast. Don't be afraid to try out a bunch at once to see what you are into, say, for example, you wanted to compare the audio players
2008-04-30T15:07:00.000Z	end-user	Jazman_brewer	yeah, I have to admit, I haven't tested wine fully. There are some great kill a few minutes games, but not too many epics here.
2008-04-30T15:26:00.000Z	end-user	Jazman_brewer	I haven't tried Amarok in Gnome, but it is simply a fantastic music player.
2008-04-30T15:28:00.000Z	end-user	Jazman_brewer	oops - yeah, what DistroJockey said :)
2008-04-30T15:29:00.000Z	end-user	Jazman_brewer	I will say this, though, the simplified interface of GNOME might be a nice introduction for a bit, to Linux, and make you appreciate some of the extra settings available in KDE
2008-04-30T15:30:00.000Z	end-user	Jazman_brewer	Exactly - I wish I'd sampled both a little more. CD's are cheap - heck, might even want to give Xubuntu a spin
2008-04-30T15:32:00.000Z	end-user	Jazman_brewer	sudo stands for "superuser do" it will prompt you for your password afterwords.
