2009-04-25T07:49:00.000Z	python_user		Since when does ubuntu not support common resolutions out of the box?
2009-04-25T07:51:00.000Z	python_user		anyone notice jaunty doesnt do laptop widescreen out of the box anymore (intel)?
2009-04-25T07:52:00.000Z	python_user		tahts the most common for a 15.4 screen
2009-04-25T07:54:00.000Z	python_user		my bad
2009-04-25T07:55:00.000Z	python_user		anyone know why jaunty detects 15.4 screens as being 15" ?
2009-04-25T07:56:00.000Z	DouglasK	python_user	int(screen_size)?
2009-04-25T07:57:00.000Z	python_user	DouglasK	?
2009-04-25T07:57:00.000Z	DouglasK		Python_user: aka, it prolly rounds down.
2009-04-25T07:58:00.000Z	python_user	DouglasK	yeah, but why would it do that? that means you cant use the widescreen resolution?
2009-04-25T07:58:00.000Z	python_user		it always detected it as 15.4
2009-04-25T07:58:00.000Z	python_user		for the last 4 versionds
2009-04-25T07:59:00.000Z	DouglasK		Python_user: Can't say for sure about that, I'm running widescreen on Intrepid now.
2009-04-25T07:59:00.000Z	python_user	DouglasK	yeah I had no problems with Intrepid
2009-04-25T08:00:00.000Z	DouglasK	python_user	what video card?
2009-04-25T08:02:00.000Z	python_user	DouglasK	intel
2009-04-25T08:02:00.000Z	DouglasK	python_user	maybe I'll be lucky ... I'm on a slightly older nvidia.
2009-04-25T08:03:00.000Z	python_user	DouglasK	irony... the intel driver is opensource so intrepid has excellent support, seems like they messed that up with jaunty
