2007-11-26T04:33:00.000Z	ubuntu_		Hello! I'm installing Ubuntu right now. I have a disk with 4 partitions: 1 is for Windows, 1 is a backup partition I created a long time ago. 1 is one that I hope I can use for Ubuntu, and I want to have another backup partition. I'm formatting the Ubuntu partition in ext3 with mount point "/", and I want the new backup partition to be fat32. Do I need to put anything special for the mount point for the backup?
2007-11-26T04:34:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	don't think so.. I think ubuntu will even add it to fstab automagically.. not sure about it though
2007-11-26T04:34:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Slart	Alright :) The main thing is that I want this partition to be accessable in Windows, too. I assume fat32 will do that?
2007-11-26T04:34:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	yes
2007-11-26T04:36:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Slart	How much do I want to set aside for swap?
2007-11-26T04:36:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	my grand grand grand dad told me twice the physical memory.. but that might have changed since then =)
2007-11-26T04:37:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	not really... up to 1G would be more than enough.. it will just get terribly slow if you need more swap
2007-11-26T04:39:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	primary I'd think
2007-11-26T04:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Slart	I don't know what the terms mean :( I've set up the partition I'm installing Ubuntu onto as primary
2007-11-26T04:41:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	primary partitions are single partitions, you can only have 4 per drive I think.. logical partitions can have more partitions inside so you can have more than 4 partitions
2008-01-25T23:27:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	huh? code name?
2008-05-23T03:51:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	space after fdisk... "fdisk -l"
2008-06-18T16:22:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	afaik ubuntu can resize ntfs.. I think it can even do it from the installer.. is the partition mounted?
2008-06-18T16:24:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	tried sudo with that?
2009-05-18T01:34:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	you could try testdisk.. but read the manual first.. if you do something wrong you might end up destroying the data
2009-08-20T18:00:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	might be because the c program does something bad.. what kind of c program is it?
2009-08-20T18:06:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	try running the c program with "nice" or "ionice" and see if that makes any difference.. it might not be about the c program at all but it's worth a try
2009-08-20T18:10:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	ah.. good..
2009-08-20T18:11:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	I would look into your program.. if you've got the source code.. perhaps it can be modified to be more friendly to the rest of the system
2009-08-20T18:11:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	or just remember to run it with "nice"
2009-08-20T18:12:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	oh.. I'm not very good with c.. you could ask in ##c or perhaps in ##programming
2010-05-28T11:24:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntu_	just ask your question
