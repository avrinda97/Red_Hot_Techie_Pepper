2008-11-16T08:25:00.000Z	tommck_	EJ	- I've been thinking about trying to kill all of X and try to reinstall it or something
2008-11-16T08:26:00.000Z	EJ	tommck	that may work ... if you do that try running x with the default vid card drivers and see if it will at least start up for you
2008-11-16T08:26:00.000Z	EJ	tommck	if it does then you can go about installing the drivers for your vid card at that point
2008-11-16T08:26:00.000Z	tommck_	EJ	- yeah, I think the next step is a braindead "vesa" video mode X setup, I guess
2008-11-16T08:27:00.000Z	tommck_	EJ	- maybe I'll do something low-tech like a fluxbox wm
2008-11-16T08:27:00.000Z	EJ	tommck	last time i had to deal with this was about 8 years ago ... and it seems that commands have changed a bit
2008-11-16T08:28:00.000Z	tommck_	EJ	- yeah.. no big deal.. I'm going to have to get drastic on myself, I think..
2008-11-16T08:28:00.000Z	tommck_	EJ	- might even contemplate a complete reinstall
2008-11-16T08:28:00.000Z	EJ	tommck	it dosent set up propely on a fresh install ?
2008-11-16T08:28:00.000Z	tommck_	EJ	- haven't tried that yet - this is my mythtv backend.. didn't want to take it out for too long
2008-11-16T08:28:00.000Z	EJ	tommck	did you install server and then add X ?
2008-11-16T08:29:00.000Z	tommck_	EJ	- no, started with Desktop install
2008-11-16T08:29:00.000Z	EJ	tommck	so you have had X running on this before ?
2008-11-16T08:30:00.000Z	tommck_	EJ	- for about a year..  not sure what broke it... I, unfortunately made a few changes that I didn't keep track of..
2008-11-16T08:30:00.000Z	EJ	tommck	ahhh i c.
2008-11-16T08:30:00.000Z	tommck_	EJ	- then I realized I'd broken it..  - stupid me
2008-11-16T08:30:00.000Z	tommck_	EJ	- thanks for the help.. think I'm going to take a crack at this stuff tomorrow morning
2008-11-16T08:31:00.000Z	EJ		well i would start with reinstalling X to see if that fixes it ... if not, you may be looking at a reinstall
2008-11-16T08:31:00.000Z	tommck_	EJ	- yeah... we'll see :)  Thanks a lot for the quick attention/help
2008-11-16T08:31:00.000Z	EJ	tommck	ok take care
2008-11-16T08:32:00.000Z	EJ	tommck	wish i could have been more help ...
2008-11-16T08:32:00.000Z	tommck_	EJ	- no problem.  at least it wasn't quick - would have made me feel like an idiot :)
