2010-02-10T04:41:00.000Z	r0k3tm3n	clicker4721	on a mac g3?
2010-02-10T04:42:00.000Z	clicker4721	r0k3tm3n	i hate typing your name, btw. anyway...perhaps i'm not familiar with the hardware you're working with. why wouldn't dvd work if cd would?
2010-02-10T04:42:00.000Z	r0k3tm3n	clicker4721	does open-firmware support dvd?  and type r0 then tab, auto complete. ;-)
2010-02-10T04:44:00.000Z	clicker4721	r0k3tm3n	I'm using X-Chat, that just displays those people in a readout. Anyway, I've honestly never heard of this open-frameware you speak of.
2010-02-10T04:44:00.000Z	clicker4721	r0k3tm3n	nm, r0k -> tab worked
2010-02-10T04:45:00.000Z	r0k3tm3n	clicker4721	Open firmware is apples version of a BIOS on the PowePC architecture
2010-02-10T04:46:00.000Z	clicker4721	r0k3tm3n	Oh! Um...you should simply have a boot from disc option, right? That doesn't specify DVD or CD...
2010-02-10T04:46:00.000Z	r0k3tm3n	clicker4721	i assume that you havent tried this before...
2010-02-10T04:47:00.000Z	clicker4721	r0k3tm3n	obviously. Hey, I'm going to get into a chat with one of my Mac friends and see if I can extract the info from him. I'll be back as soon as the quest is completed.
2010-02-10T04:48:00.000Z	r0k3tm3n	clicker4721	thanks, PM me k?
2010-02-10T04:48:00.000Z	clicker4721	r0k3tm3n	You got it.
