2005-01-17T11:44:00.000Z	DanielC		Hello. Is it worth upgrading the kernel to 'linux-image-686' instead of the default -386 ?
2005-01-17T11:44:00.000Z	bob2	DanielC	can give a bit of a speed boost
2005-01-17T11:44:00.000Z	bob2	DanielC	no
2005-01-17T11:51:00.000Z	DanielC	bob2	ok, I tried google, but I can't figure out how to upgrade a kernel "the Debian way".
2005-01-17T11:52:00.000Z	bob2	DanielC	install the package. reboot.
2005-01-17T11:52:00.000Z	DanielC	bob2	That's it? apt-get install and reboot? Wow.
2005-06-22T13:05:00.000Z	DanielC	bob2	g1gaman: Shouldn't there be a way to (say) mount /usr on the 1.7 GB drive and mount / on the 1 GB?
2005-06-22T13:06:00.000Z	bob2	DanielC	sure, you can do that during the install
2005-11-08T07:41:00.000Z	bob2	DanielC	are you behind NAT?
2005-11-08T07:42:00.000Z	DanielC	bob2	I don't know what a NAT is.
2005-11-08T07:42:00.000Z	bob2	DanielC	then tell us how yo uare connected to the internet
2005-11-08T07:42:00.000Z	DanielC	bob2	Home network -> DSL router
2005-11-08T07:43:00.000Z	bob2	DanielC	how many ip addresses did your isp give you?
2005-11-08T07:43:00.000Z	bob2	DanielC	if you don't know, the anser is 1 and you are nat'ed.
2005-11-08T07:44:00.000Z	DanielC	bob2	The configuration wizard of Azureus says "NAT error", so whatever a NAT is, that's probably the problem.
2005-11-08T07:44:00.000Z	DanielC	bob2	Okay, I mus be NAT'ed.
2005-11-08T07:44:00.000Z	bob2	DanielC	in which case you need to configure your router to forward a port to you, then you need to configure azarues to use that port.
2005-11-08T07:45:00.000Z	bob2	DanielC	no
2005-11-08T07:46:00.000Z	bob2	DanielC	you need to configure your router to forward a particular port in to your desktop
2005-11-08T07:46:00.000Z	DanielC	bob2	ok
2005-11-08T07:47:00.000Z	DanielC	bob2	set router to forward port 6881 to my computer, got it.
2005-11-08T07:48:00.000Z	bob2	DanielC	yes, exactly
