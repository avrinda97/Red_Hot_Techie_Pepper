2010-10-17T21:17:00.000Z	ePirat		how can i open the settings in the terminal? i mean wich command i need?
2010-10-17T21:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ePirat	 what settings?
2010-10-17T21:18:00.000Z	ePirat	Dr_Willis	system settings
2010-10-17T21:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ePirat	 and.. which system setting? You want to run the PROGRAM from the termiinal? or what exactly?
2010-10-17T21:19:00.000Z	ePirat	Dr_Willis	 i want to open the gnome display settings panel
2010-10-17T21:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ePirat	 perhasp you want to run --> gnome-display-properties
2010-10-17T21:20:00.000Z	ePirat	Dr_Willis	YES! THX!
2010-10-17T21:25:00.000Z	ePirat	Dr_Willis	and wich is the command for the login window properties? (where i can set auto-login, display start sound...)
2010-10-17T21:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ePirat	 try 'gnome<tabkey>' and see..    are you missing all your menus or somting?
2010-10-17T21:26:00.000Z	ePirat	Dr_Willis	yes, i have a strange bug...
2010-10-17T21:29:00.000Z	ePirat	Dr_Willis	seems like there are no login settings...
2010-10-17T21:30:00.000Z	ePirat	Dr_Willis	the problem is, that i enabled auto-login, now i have this bug, now i want to turn it off again but i have no menus
2010-10-17T21:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ePirat	 you can always go to the console and 'sudo service gdm stop'  i guess.. theres some binary that had all the gnome-settings icons in it.. i saw today.. but not sure what the binary name was
2010-10-17T21:32:00.000Z	ePirat	Dr_Willis	i am confused now... o.O
2010-10-17T21:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ePirat	 i got an icon here called 'control center' that has all the gnome settings tools/icons in it...
2010-10-17T21:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ePirat	 it seems to be called 'gnome-control-center'
2010-10-17T21:38:00.000Z	ePirat	Dr_Willis	OH! Thanks it worked!
2011-04-20T18:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ePirat	 sudo service gdm restart   - will restart X  and get you back to the login screen..
2011-04-20T18:58:00.000Z	ePirat	Dr_Willis	how can i switch to command line?
2011-04-20T18:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ePirat	 you said you can use ssh...
2011-04-20T18:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ePirat	 so ssh in.
