2008-11-21T07:54:00.000Z	arktvrvs	nbeebo	try figuring ou whats wrong with it first.
2008-11-21T08:20:00.000Z	arktvrvs	nbeebo	Probably no way to tell that but to manually check it.
2008-11-21T08:21:00.000Z	arktvrvs	nbeebo	speakers aren't usually recognized by an os.. just the sound card
2008-11-21T08:26:00.000Z	arktvrvs	nbeebo	is it in lspci?
2008-11-21T08:42:00.000Z	arktvrvs	nbeebo	doubleclick the volumecontrol icon make sure nothign is muted
2008-11-21T08:47:00.000Z	arktvrvs	nbeebo	that sounds fine
2008-11-21T08:51:00.000Z	arktvrvs	nbeebo	close all apps that may be using the soundcard and then open up just one
2008-11-21T09:21:00.000Z	arktvrvs	nbeebo	that is what mine isi  believe, it is not the error
2008-11-21T23:25:00.000Z	arktvrvs	nbeebo	restart into the rescue shell, do Xorg -configure , mv the new config to /etc/X11/xorg.conf then reboot
2008-11-21T23:26:00.000Z	nbeebo	arktvrvs	from where do u move it?
2008-11-21T23:26:00.000Z	arktvrvs	nbeebo	it will tell you
2008-11-21T23:26:00.000Z	nbeebo	arktvrvs	ok thanks
2008-11-21T23:48:00.000Z	arktvrvs	nbeebo	what did you do exactly?
2008-11-21T23:49:00.000Z	arktvrvs	nbeebo	if /root/ is where it placed it ok, but on my system its just in / .. and it needs to be moved to /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-11-21T23:51:00.000Z	arktvrvs	nbeebo	if you typed it exactly as i said and its made no difference then sorry, thats the only way i know of
2008-11-21T23:53:00.000Z	arktvrvs	nbeebo	on a default install i only get 800x600 max, after doing that it goes somewhere around 1900 or more..
2008-11-21T23:54:00.000Z	arktvrvs	nbeebo	/exec
