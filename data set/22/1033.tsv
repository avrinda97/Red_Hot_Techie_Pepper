2010-11-08T07:47:00.000Z	randomusr_		to call someone that cares
2010-11-08T07:48:00.000Z	randomusr_		system level bugs are far more important that a camera

2010-11-08T07:52:00.000Z	randomusr_		Possible to download my wireless driver from ubuntu repos over http?
2010-11-08T07:52:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	randomusr_	you should use the additional drivers checker for that kind of thing
2010-11-08T07:52:00.000Z	randomusr_	RottNKorpse	what's that?
2010-11-08T07:53:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	randomusr_	at the top left on the main menu go to System -> Administration -> Additional Drivers
2010-11-08T07:54:00.000Z	randomusr_	RottNKorpse	no "Additional Drivers" on the menu
2010-11-08T07:55:00.000Z	randomusr_	RottNKorpse	I'm on a seperate computer from the one missing a network driver
2010-11-08T07:55:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	randomusr_	what version of ubuntu do you use
2010-11-08T07:56:00.000Z	randomusr_	RottNKorpse	I lised 9.04
2010-11-08T07:57:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	randomusr_	oh you are on 9.04 ok yea different listing for that
2010-11-08T07:57:00.000Z	randomusr_	RottNKorpse	I lied it's actually 9.10 meh
2010-11-08T07:57:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	randomusr_	look for the terms hardware drivers or proprietary drivers
2010-11-08T07:58:00.000Z	randomusr_	RottNKorpse	I believe that's only for video drivers?
2010-11-08T07:59:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	randomusr_	you could also try System -> Administration -> Update Manager
2010-11-08T07:59:00.000Z	randomusr_	RottNKorpse	no internet. Thus I need my wireless driver
2010-11-08T07:59:00.000Z	randomusr_	RottNKorpse	I'm not wired
2010-11-08T07:59:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	randomusr_	and from there click settings -> put in password -> the
2010-11-08T07:59:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	randomusr_	can you setup up temporary wired?
2010-11-08T08:00:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	randomusr_	you will need internet on that machine to get updates and such - without all the latest updates it probably wont be able to find drivers - what is your nic?
2010-11-08T08:01:00.000Z	randomusr_	RottNKorpse	thanks for the input.
