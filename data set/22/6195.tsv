2006-12-06T13:31:00.000Z	kuzmaster		can somone please tell me, step-by-step, how to create a user in proftpd, that has un-restricted access to the whole disk?
2006-12-06T13:31:00.000Z	kuzmaster		please!
2006-12-06T13:31:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	That seems like a bad idea, actually ..
2006-12-06T13:32:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	You know how insecure FTP is, right?
2006-12-06T13:32:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	So you're sure it's firewalled off from the outside world?
2006-12-06T13:34:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	Okay, then maybe it's an okay idea if you really trust your devs.  I just don't have any experience with proftpd, sorry :-(
2006-12-06T13:35:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	Security through obscurity?
2006-12-06T13:35:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	If you're going to be the only one using it, why not just use WinSCP or something like it?
2006-12-06T13:35:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	That's what I use for the kinds of situations you're describing.  It doesn't need a separate server either ... it works right through sshd using ssh as a secure tunnel.
2006-12-06T13:36:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	You've used scp before, right?
2006-12-06T13:37:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	I haven't bothered with ftp in many years now because it's yet another service that opens holes and isn't necessary.
2006-12-06T13:37:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	scp is a command-line tool to securely copy files between remote locations and local locations.
2006-12-06T13:37:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	It uses SSH as a tunnel.
2006-12-06T13:37:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	Various GUIs for scp exist, like WinSCP, that provide an FTP-alike interface.
2006-12-06T13:38:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	It's very good, you'll like it.
2006-12-06T13:40:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	scp is good and simple when using it with people you trust because it just uses normal ssh accounts, e.g. your system accounts.  It doesn't replace a real ftp server because it doesn't have its own accounts ... so to make another account for someone to access scp with you have to make another system account.  You can set its shell to scp-only or whatever, but for a large number of different users, scp doesn't really make sense.
2006-12-06T13:40:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	But if it's just for you, scp makes perfect sense.
2006-12-06T13:53:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	Is the user you're logged in as in the www-data group, and are the perms on your www directory set to g+w ?
2006-12-06T13:54:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	It's chown -R www-data:www-data <insert web directory here>
2006-12-06T13:54:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	www-data:www-data gives the user and group name respectively, but if you don't give it stuff to work on, it won't have anything to do.
2006-12-06T13:54:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	That should work.
2006-12-06T13:54:00.000Z	Cyde	kuzmaster	-R is for recursive
