2009-05-05T17:33:00.000Z	Bodsda	indus	it is asking for the sudo password not the root password
2009-05-05T17:36:00.000Z	Bodsda	indus	everything
2009-05-05T17:36:00.000Z	Bodsda	indus	yes
2009-05-05T17:37:00.000Z	Bodsda	indus	please dont write that whole command
2009-05-05T17:37:00.000Z	indus	Bodsda	yes iam awarre i didnt
2009-05-05T17:38:00.000Z	Bodsda	indus	hittt -- Still, that command, whether intended as a joke or not, is not welcome in this channel
2009-05-05T17:38:00.000Z	indus	Bodsda	its a generic command
2009-05-05T17:49:00.000Z	indus	Bodsda	epic fail for you maybe, it worked flawless for me
2009-05-07T14:54:00.000Z	Bodsda	indus	you'll be using the jaunty repo's then so sort of yeah, then i think you need to do dist-upgrade and it should skip intrepid (skipping releases is not generally supported)
2009-05-07T14:55:00.000Z	indus	Bodsda	 i heard its dangerous as it only gets the jaunty packages but doesnt really upgrage the system??
2009-05-07T14:55:00.000Z	Bodsda	indus	be on the safe side then, upgrade to intrepid then to jaunty
2009-05-07T14:56:00.000Z	indus	Bodsda	ya thats my question >if it was ok ,wouldnt the ubuntu devs give you a direct update through update manager
2009-05-07T14:56:00.000Z	indus	Bodsda	but they dont meaning there is a problem somewhere?
2009-05-07T14:57:00.000Z	Bodsda	indus	uhm, im not sure, I know you can do direct upgrades from LTS to LTS, eg skipping non LTS releases
2009-05-07T14:57:00.000Z	indus	Bodsda	hmm ya that does make sense
2009-05-07T14:58:00.000Z	indus	Bodsda	so i guess its safe then
2009-05-07T14:58:00.000Z	indus	Bodsda	you think i will make it if i upgrade dapper to jaunty?
2009-05-07T14:59:00.000Z	Bodsda	indus	it will take time, but yeah should be fine, backups are your friend :)
2009-05-07T15:03:00.000Z	Bodsda	indus	dont worry, visudo doesnt seem to work.. for me at least anyway
2009-05-07T15:09:00.000Z	indus	Bodsda	you are right, doenst seem to work
2009-05-07T15:09:00.000Z	indus	Bodsda	it doesnt work from a root shell
2009-05-07T15:10:00.000Z	Bodsda	indus	i guess the devs are "windows'ing" us again -- i think you have to do it from recovery console
