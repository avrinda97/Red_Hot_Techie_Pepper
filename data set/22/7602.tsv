2006-06-11T08:26:00.000Z	di		hi, i get a kernel panic (attempted to kill init) when i try to boot into the amd64 livecd on an amd turion
2006-06-11T08:27:00.000Z	intelikey	di	eeek   what error with the panic ?
2006-06-11T08:28:00.000Z	di	intelikey	does it have to do with amd64/
2006-06-11T08:29:00.000Z	intelikey	di	i dont know, what reason did it give other than trying to kill init....   what preceeded that ?
2006-06-11T08:30:00.000Z	di	intelikey	i forgot... sorry
2006-06-11T08:31:00.000Z	di	intelikey	mabye its not synching
2006-06-11T08:32:00.000Z	intelikey	di	normally 'trying to kill init' means that init opened as a shell and you are now exiting that shell   the initrd.img can do that but normally the preceeding text to the panic helps understand what is happening.   try to boot with appended quiet=off and verbos  maybe...
2006-06-11T08:33:00.000Z	di	intelikey	thanks...
2006-06-11T08:35:00.000Z	intelikey	di	also hit the f keys and see if there is a boot option for your hardware.  i haven't yet gotten the cd's so i'll have to shoot in the dark a bit longer.
2006-06-11T08:36:00.000Z	di	intelikey	hmm... ill try that if my sis lets me use her laptop to install ubuntu...
2006-06-11T08:37:00.000Z	intelikey	di	yeah normally there are some help pages avalable at the boot prompt  f1  to start with.
2006-06-13T08:25:00.000Z	intelikey	di	what error ?
2006-06-13T08:36:00.000Z	intelikey	di	sudo dpkg --force-all --purge package   ?
2006-06-13T08:37:00.000Z	di	intelikey	i tried sudo dpkg --force- -r libc6 and now commands like ls and sudo dont work
2006-06-13T08:38:00.000Z	intelikey	di	and that errored out because there was no agr to the force agr..... man dpkg
2006-06-13T08:39:00.000Z	intelikey	di	it's not  --force- blah.   it's --force-<agr>     where arg might be   all
2006-06-13T08:45:00.000Z	di	intelikey	what happens when the ubuntu installer runs grub-install hd0 when grub is already in the mbr?
2006-06-13T08:45:00.000Z	intelikey	di	it just over-writes the mbr
2006-06-13T08:46:00.000Z	di	intelikey	will that be damaging?
2006-06-13T08:46:00.000Z	intelikey	di	see the links for !dualboot  and  !grub   check the wiki on that
2006-06-13T08:53:00.000Z	intelikey	di	no it should'nt be
2006-06-13T08:54:00.000Z	intelikey	di	i sent you to the wiki to see what people have to recover from after installing grub and windows in both orders.    you may not have any other os.... if not it can't hurt a thing.
