2006-07-26T07:14:00.000Z	Ronz	sethk	by default su is not available to root
2006-07-26T07:14:00.000Z	sethk	Ronz	not true
2006-07-26T07:15:00.000Z	sethk	Ronz	you are confused.  the root password is not set in _some_ of the installation mode, but _is_ set in other installation modes
2006-07-26T07:16:00.000Z	sethk	Ronz	not true. su to root is available
2006-07-26T07:16:00.000Z	sethk	Ronz	once the root password is set, su to root is available.  the root password is set during install for expert mode, but not set during install for default mode.
2006-07-26T07:17:00.000Z	Ronz	sethk	with some installs, by default...su'ing to root is not in ubuntu. they did this for security purpose
2006-07-26T07:18:00.000Z	sethk	Ronz	that's not true.  before the password is set, you can neither login as root nor su.  once the root password is set, you can both login as root and su.
2006-07-26T07:18:00.000Z	Ronz	sethk	this was to avoid being able to run cracks on "root" user, and to do away with the root user. they made ubuntu so you can sudo, and not have to su
2006-07-26T07:18:00.000Z	sethk	Ronz	all linux and unix varieties have sudo , and have for at least 15 years.
2006-07-26T07:21:00.000Z	Ronz	sethk	with gentoo, you can su to root. by default in gentoo, you cant. in order to get it to work, you need to sudo passwd
2006-07-26T07:22:00.000Z	sethk	Ronz	that's not true for expert install mode.  You can't seriously contend that the ubuntu designers made a conscious decision to make an expert mode install less secure.
2006-07-26T07:23:00.000Z	Ronz	sethk	it may be like that in the expert mode. im saying when it is instaleld normally...non-expert mode, thats how they do it.
2006-07-26T07:24:00.000Z	sethk	Ronz	it's not correct to say that you can't su to root.  The root password has not been set.  That's an entirely different thing.
2006-07-26T07:24:00.000Z	sethk	Ronz	actually, the situation is that the root password is unknown, not unset, but that's a technicality.
2006-07-26T07:25:00.000Z	Ronz	sethk	so if you do an expert setup of ubuntu, you have access to root, because you set the password. if you do non-expert, you do not have a password for root. i think were just saying the same thing over and over, lol
2006-08-01T14:45:00.000Z	sethk	Ronz	there are tools to recover the superblock
2006-08-01T14:45:00.000Z	sethk	Ronz	there are redundent superblocks
2006-08-01T14:45:00.000Z	sethk	Ronz	if it is ext2/3 check the ext2/3 utilities.
2006-08-01T14:47:00.000Z	Ronz	sethk	do you know the name of the ext3 utility?
2006-08-01T14:47:00.000Z	sethk	Ronz	no, sorry.  It may be an option to fsck.ext2 (or fsck.ext3).  check the docs.
2006-08-01T14:48:00.000Z	Ronz	sethk	"fsck.ext3: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sda"
2006-08-01T14:49:00.000Z	sethk	Ronz	check the ext3 docs.  there is definitely a way to recover the superblock (or, at least, attempt to recover, it isn't guaranteed to work)
