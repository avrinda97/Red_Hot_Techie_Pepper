2010-07-28T18:12:00.000Z	ksbalaji		I was upgrading from 8.04 to 9.10. Infact, I wanted to upgrade again to 10.4
2010-07-28T18:14:00.000Z	ksbalaji		Yeah. I was searching for that. But the upgrade app showed only 9.10 to upgrade.
2010-07-28T18:14:00.000Z	cmpsalvestrini	ksbalaji	I suppose a repair upgrade could be doable, I never faced a power cut. Depending on your partitioning it could ba as "simple" as installing 10.04 directly instead of dealing with a broken upgrade, methinks.
2010-07-28T18:15:00.000Z	ksbalaji	cmpsalvestrini	You sound very reasonable. Unfortunately, I do not have a 10.04 installable dvd.
2010-07-28T18:16:00.000Z	ksbalaji	cmpsalvestrini	further, all upgrade for 9.10 was already done. The failure occurred only at the fag end.
2010-07-28T18:17:00.000Z	cmpsalvestrini	ksbalaji	... Darn. Talk about misfortune! What's your box's status at the moment?
2010-07-28T18:17:00.000Z	ksbalaji	cmpsalvestrini	the downloads were over. unpacking done and midway configuring, dpkg failed.- pwr failed.
2010-07-28T18:18:00.000Z	ksbalaji	cmpsalvestrini	yeah. misfortune. I searched and found this knoppix livecd and am contacting using this! after 3 years of ubuntu!
2010-07-28T18:20:00.000Z	ksbalaji	cmpsalvestrini	the only other livecd for ubuntu I have is an old gutsy.
2010-07-28T18:22:00.000Z	cmpsalvestrini	ksbalaji	can you access your data? I would suggest backing it all to an USB stick, download the 10.04 iso, place it on an USB stick, boot from the USB stick, and then restore your data. From here it sounds like the best alternative for you at this time. I assume that you tried to boot your box and that it is in an unusable state.
2010-07-28T18:25:00.000Z	ksbalaji	cmpsalvestrini	though the upgrade failed, as a consolation, the recovery mode works for the previous kernel. Otherwise, the data partitioning etc seem to be intact in the hdd.
2010-07-28T18:26:00.000Z	ksbalaji	cmpsalvestrini	But, I am no good with linux commands. especially those related with upgrade repair work!
2010-07-28T18:27:00.000Z	cmpsalvestrini	ksbalaji	have you tried the recovery mode? My solution is quite... radical, so to speak, so I'd like to keep it as a last resort in case everything else fails.
2010-07-28T18:28:00.000Z	ksbalaji	cmpsalvestrini	what is this recovery mode? I am able to boot the last kernel recovery - not the gui version. but command prompt is offered.
2010-07-28T18:30:00.000Z	ksbalaji	cmpsalvestrini	monkey_dust_ I took a grave risk in upgrading without a backup. Even now, ubuntu is alive. but unable to get up and running!
2010-07-28T18:34:00.000Z	cmpsalvestrini	ksbalaji	Sounds like in CLI recovery mode it *should* be possible to run apt commands to redo the upgrade, otherwise I'm afraid the only way would be to download the 10.04 ISO and transfer it to an USB stick for a clean installation from the USB stick. I'm sure this is doable with your Knopix installation.
2010-07-28T18:37:00.000Z	ksbalaji	cmpsalvestrini	Yes . thanks. I also feel that this can be done. ... And thats why I am here. BUT, ignorant me, I need help.
2010-07-28T19:09:00.000Z	cmpsalvestrini	ksbalaji	there's a thead in ubuntuforums about repairing apt-get, here's the link: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=357857
2010-07-28T19:13:00.000Z	cmpsalvestrini	ksbalaji	a read-only filesystem IMLK happens when said filesystem is not mounted. Perhaps by mounting the filesystem the command should work?
2010-07-28T19:15:00.000Z	ksbalaji	cmpsalvestrini	sounds just. which file system is to be mounted? what filesystems do dpkg deal with? I dont know :((
2010-07-28T19:19:00.000Z	cmpsalvestrini	ksbalaji	try mounting the root filesystem on your ubuntu box, the exact /dev is dependent on your partitioning and installation
2010-07-28T19:22:00.000Z	ksbalaji	cmpsalvestrini	so shall I try. now I have to reboot shutting down this livecd. Thanks! hope to come here thru Ubuntu.
