2007-08-19T14:49:00.000Z	meoblast001	stefg	??????????
2007-08-19T14:50:00.000Z	meoblast001	stefg	what does that mean?
2007-08-19T14:50:00.000Z	stefg	meoblast001	run firefox -profilemanager from cli and add a new profile
2007-08-19T14:51:00.000Z	meoblast001	stefg	that just launched firefox
2007-08-19T14:53:00.000Z	stefg	meoblast001	that's firefox -ProfileManager
2007-08-19T14:56:00.000Z	meoblast001	stefg	how will this help my problem
2007-09-09T08:38:00.000Z	stefg	meoblast001	in theory yes, but it's slow and unreliable and i'd never do it without a bckup
2007-09-09T08:39:00.000Z	meoblast001	stefg	i just need some more space for Ubuntu... my Windows partitions already fucked... its just where i store my crappy crap at
2007-09-09T08:40:00.000Z	stefg	meoblast001	you need not necesarily resize partitons... you could separate /home or /var .... gazillions of ways to add space to a Linux system transparently
2008-12-30T00:20:00.000Z	meoblast001	stefg	how would he install that if he cant move his mouse?
2008-12-30T00:21:00.000Z	stefg	meoblast001	does he have an external USB mouse at hand? usually these work, even if the internal touchpad doesnt
2008-12-30T00:21:00.000Z	meoblast001	stefg	he said he could borrow one from his grandmas
2008-12-30T00:23:00.000Z	meoblast001	stefg	he said his caps lock was blinking on and off too
2008-12-30T00:24:00.000Z	stefg	meoblast001	that's a kernel panic.... so the mouse is the last of his problems then
2008-12-30T00:24:00.000Z	meoblast001	stefg	he said it kept doing that
2008-12-30T00:25:00.000Z	meoblast001	stefg	i dont know which one he should use
2008-12-30T00:27:00.000Z	stefg	meoblast001	that depends... he should first run a boot into single mode (without bootsplash) and see which errors scroll by dfuring the verbose boot process on the console
2008-12-30T00:28:00.000Z	meoblast001	stefg	so hit the control alt f1 while usplash is up?
2008-12-30T00:29:00.000Z	stefg	meoblast001	simply 'esc' and 'cursor down' to chose the single mode from grubs menu. boot splash is automatically disabled for theis mode
2008-12-30T00:30:00.000Z	meoblast001	stefg	oh
