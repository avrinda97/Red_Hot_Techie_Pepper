2005-11-09T15:45:00.000Z	StyXman		hi all
2005-11-09T15:45:00.000Z	StyXman		anyone tried to use the 2.6.14 kernel in debian sid w/ breezy?
2005-11-09T15:45:00.000Z	StyXman		I get a ``cannot open initial console'' message
2005-11-09T15:45:00.000Z	StyXman		but I don't have devfs installed and 2,.6.14 does not even support it
2005-11-09T15:46:00.000Z	crimsun	StyXman	um, please don't go around randomly installing kernels from other distros
2005-11-09T15:47:00.000Z	StyXman	crimsun	ahm, I actually installed the sources and compiled
2005-11-09T15:47:00.000Z	crimsun	StyXman	but are you familiar with Ubuntu's config? If not, you're liable to encounter issues such as the one you just did
2005-11-09T15:50:00.000Z	StyXman	crimsun	I made a make oldconfig over a previous .config file from 2.6.11 which does work
2005-11-09T15:51:00.000Z	crimsun	StyXman	but you didn't build an initramfs
2005-11-09T15:52:00.000Z	StyXman	crimsun	neityher did I w/ the 2.6.11 that is runnning now and that always run...
2005-11-09T15:52:00.000Z	crimsun	StyXman	then which configuration options did you forget to toggle?
2005-11-09T15:58:00.000Z	StyXman	crimsun	well, dunno
2005-11-09T15:59:00.000Z	StyXman	crimsun	well, there are differences between 2.6.11 and 1.6.14
2005-11-09T16:00:00.000Z	crimsun	StyXman	the config options common to both should not have changed.
2005-11-09T16:03:00.000Z	StyXman	crimsun	and they didn't. I just removed some modules I don't need
2005-11-09T16:04:00.000Z	crimsun	StyXman	so figure out why your VT and CONSOLE options have been altered
2005-11-09T16:05:00.000Z	StyXman	crimsun	ok
2005-11-09T16:07:00.000Z	StyXman	crimsun	well, I have devfs compiled in 2.6.11, but I don't have devfsd. 2.6.14 doesn't have devfs...
2005-11-09T16:10:00.000Z	StyXman	crimsun	also, I have udev installed...
2005-11-09T16:20:00.000Z	StyXman	crimsun	seems like devfs is the one to blame here
2005-11-09T16:20:00.000Z	StyXman	crimsun	do you know how udev works? any good pointers?
2006-01-01T15:09:00.000Z	crimsun	StyXman	both.
