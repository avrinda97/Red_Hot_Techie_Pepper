2007-03-31T06:34:00.000Z	kingcobra	Flannel	ok thanx, can i ask a few more ppl here to find out the advantages of each or is there a better way
2007-03-31T06:35:00.000Z	Flannel	kingcobra	That'd be one method, another would be to just try each.  It's all up to you
2007-03-31T06:37:00.000Z	kingcobra	Flannel	:) to me the advantages might not be apparent immediately so i would like to ask plus there might be some which i dont know about
