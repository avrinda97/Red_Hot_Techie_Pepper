2005-09-01T07:42:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	 use synaptic
2005-09-01T07:35:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	it's installed by default
2005-09-01T07:36:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	system > admin > synaptic
2005-09-01T07:37:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	fire up synaptic and browse it's offerings
2005-09-01T07:38:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	they do 2 different things
2005-09-01T07:43:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	use synaptic to install mpg321
2005-09-01T07:43:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	it will install the correct files for you
2005-09-01T07:58:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	to my knowledge, mpg123 is a console program
2005-09-01T07:59:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	as ekimus says
2005-09-01T08:06:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	ekimus told you how earlier. open a terminal and type mpg321 /path/to/file
2005-09-01T08:09:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	no flooding please. use #flood or a pastebin (read the /topic)
2005-09-01T08:11:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	perhaps a visit to the  mpg321 website for instructions?
2005-09-01T08:17:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	wine. you can read about it at www.winehq.org
2005-09-01T08:22:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	have you been to wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats   ? you need to set ubuntu up for mp3 playback
2005-09-01T08:54:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	try gftp
2005-09-01T08:56:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	it should be in your menu under "internet"
2005-09-01T08:58:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	that is unusual, for it now to show up in the menu
2005-09-01T08:59:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	shouldn't have to restart for anything less than a kernel upgrade
2005-09-01T09:03:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	wiki.ubuntu.com/SoundProblemsHoary
2005-09-01T09:35:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	unrar-nonfree
2005-09-01T09:38:00.000Z	nalioth	nima	no, it is a console app, but it will be used by ark or file-roller (these are gui programs)
