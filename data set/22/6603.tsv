2007-07-02T13:34:00.000Z	kazim59	bruenig	where can i download iso for windows?
2007-07-02T13:34:00.000Z	bruenig	kazim59	missed the point, reread until you figure it out
2007-07-02T13:40:00.000Z	kazim59	bruenig	do you know the reason?
2007-07-02T13:40:00.000Z	bruenig	kazim59	it is entrenched
2007-07-02T13:41:00.000Z	kazim59	bruenig	I think different... Linux ain't idiot friendly... and there are a lots of idiots out there...
2007-07-02T13:41:00.000Z	bruenig	kazim59	windows isn't idiot friendly either though, I suppose it just takes longer to realize when your idiotic ways lead to your being overrun by viri
2007-07-02T13:42:00.000Z	kazim59	bruenig	but people have got a mindset that an OS must be tooo easy to use... something that's not worth learngin
2007-07-02T13:43:00.000Z	bruenig	kazim59	perhaps, people learn how to use windows though, it just depends on what you are brought up
2007-07-02T13:43:00.000Z	kazim59	bruenig	I am an engineering student... computer science... and I have converted more than 10-20 of my classmates to ubuntu.. lol (from windows)
2007-07-02T13:44:00.000Z	bruenig	kazim59	it takes quite a while to take completely new user to understanding how to install something on windows, I would actually argue that installing stuff on linux for a person who has never been a computer user would be easier to explain than on windows
2007-07-02T13:44:00.000Z	kazim59	bruenig	and that was simple... they were very sad about viruses... i suggested linux
2007-07-02T13:47:00.000Z	kazim59	bruenig	gaim got voice chat?
2007-07-02T13:48:00.000Z	bruenig	kazim59	don't know
2007-07-02T13:48:00.000Z	kazim59	bruenig	no it doesn't... i m using it (pidgin)
2007-07-02T13:49:00.000Z	kazim59	bruenig	nope.. .i thought the feature may be somewhere deep inside it... i really need something that allows voice chat
2007-07-02T13:49:00.000Z	kazim59	bruenig	so far ... i found only skype!
2007-07-02T13:49:00.000Z	bruenig	kazim59	haven't much need for it
2007-07-02T13:51:00.000Z	kazim59	bruenig	awful? why?
2007-08-28T13:55:00.000Z	bruenig	kazim59	it looks to me like the guy is trying to have the output of that command stored in winedebug perhaps so he can echo it later if need be, however the syntax is all messed up
2007-08-28T13:55:00.000Z	kazim59	bruenig	no, WINEDEBUG is an environment variable set (that wine looks at)
2007-08-28T13:56:00.000Z	bruenig	kazim59	oh so it is strictly optional though?
2007-08-28T13:56:00.000Z	kazim59	bruenig	yes
