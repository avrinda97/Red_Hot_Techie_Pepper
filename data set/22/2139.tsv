2012-07-13T03:12:00.000Z	meoblast001		Unity's "stability" confuses me so much
2012-07-13T03:12:00.000Z	meoblast001		how is it that both of my machines randomly lock up and the hard drive usage goes solid until i shut the machine down
2012-07-13T03:12:00.000Z	meoblast001		i can't move the cursor or anything
2012-07-13T03:12:00.000Z	meoblast001		machine grinds to a complete halt
2012-07-13T03:13:00.000Z	meoblast001		no, it sounds like a bad Unity bug
2012-07-13T03:13:00.000Z	meoblast001		this did not happen until i upgraded to 12.04
2012-07-13T03:13:00.000Z	meoblast001		both machines started doing it at the same time
2012-07-13T03:14:00.000Z	meoblast001		same
2012-07-13T03:14:00.000Z	meoblast001		i've considered switching to Debian
2012-07-13T03:14:00.000Z	meoblast001		i would have months ago if i didn't hate change so much
2012-07-13T03:14:00.000Z	OerHeks	meoblast001	use top or install htop to see what process is bugging you
2012-07-13T03:15:00.000Z	meoblast001	OerHeks	problem is, when this process does its.... thing... he system becomes unusable quite quickly
2012-07-13T03:15:00.000Z	meoblast001		so right now, i doubt top would even find the problem
2012-07-13T03:15:00.000Z	meoblast001		but at a random moment, my hard drive light goes on full and my cursor stops moving
2012-07-13T03:16:00.000Z	OerHeks	meoblast001	top can identify what causes it, i could say random common problem is ubuntu-one trying to connect
2012-07-13T03:16:00.000Z	meoblast001	OerHeks	i don't use Ubuntu One, would it be running anyway?
2012-07-13T03:17:00.000Z	OerHeks	meoblast001	i thought it is running standard somewere
2012-07-13T03:18:00.000Z	meoblast001		oh, it seems so
2012-07-13T03:18:00.000Z	meoblast001	OerHeks	is it possible to remove Ubuntu One completely?
2012-07-13T03:19:00.000Z	OerHeks	meoblast001	yes, you could remove it from startup.
2012-07-13T03:22:00.000Z	OerHeks	meoblast001	`u1sdtool -q` will stop the daemon
2012-07-13T03:23:00.000Z	meoblast001	OerHeks	i just killed ubuntuone-syncdaemon
