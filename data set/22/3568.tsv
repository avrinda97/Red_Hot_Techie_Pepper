2008-08-04T14:18:00.000Z	seekingtruth	lokuaz	IN the words of Einstein, "....Ninety-nine times, the conclusion is false. The hundredth time I am righ"
2008-08-04T14:18:00.000Z	seekingtruth	lokuaz	:)
2008-08-04T14:19:00.000Z	seekingtruth	lokuaz	my Vista and ubuntu boot in 20 secs too
2008-08-04T14:20:00.000Z	seekingtruth	lokuaz	yes, but I tweaked it and disabled all communicsation with MS servers and disabled many services that slow boot times
2008-08-04T14:23:00.000Z	seekingtruth	lokuaz	use vista manager for starters
2008-08-04T14:24:00.000Z	seekingtruth	lokuaz	and use vispa to disable all communication with MS servers
