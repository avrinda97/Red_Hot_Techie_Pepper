2008-07-07T21:14:00.000Z	KenBW2		anyone know how I can figure out how to be able to view PHP files on my hard drive?
2008-07-07T21:14:00.000Z	KenBW2		no, i mean once ive made them
2008-07-07T21:14:00.000Z	KenBW2		to view them as web page
2008-07-07T21:15:00.000Z	KenBW2		is the Mark Packages By Task > LAMP Server in Synaptic sufficient?
2008-07-07T21:15:00.000Z	Flannel	KenBW2	Yeah.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP is also a way
2008-07-07T21:14:00.000Z	Flannel	KenBW2	open them in a text editor
2008-07-07T21:14:00.000Z	Flannel	KenBW2	Install a webserver
2008-10-22T02:11:00.000Z	Flannel	KenBW2	not playing well with others
2008-10-22T02:11:00.000Z	KenBW2	Flannel	well, i suppose
2009-01-21T06:05:00.000Z	Flannel	KenBW2	#ubuntu+1 for Jaunty questions, thanks
2009-10-31T02:49:00.000Z	Flannel	KenBW2	That's "Grub2"
2009-10-31T02:49:00.000Z	KenBW2	Flannel	1.94 = 2? :S
2009-10-31T02:49:00.000Z	Flannel	KenBW2	er, 1.97 beta4 is 2, yeah.
2009-10-31T02:50:00.000Z	Flannel	KenBW2	GRUB was always 0.97, never 1
2009-10-31T02:50:00.000Z	KenBW2	Flannel	random, fair enough
2009-10-31T02:51:00.000Z	Flannel	KenBW2	There is nothing higher than GRUB 1.97b4 right now.  If you want GRUB 2.0, you're out of luck.
2009-10-31T02:51:00.000Z	KenBW2	Flannel	so was there never a v1?
2009-10-31T02:51:00.000Z	Flannel	KenBW2	No, 0.97: http://svn.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/tags/?root=grub
2009-10-31T02:51:00.000Z	KenBW2	Flannel	strange set up. ah well
2009-10-31T04:42:00.000Z	Flannel	KenBW2	Please remain polite, thanks
2009-10-31T04:43:00.000Z	KenBW2	Flannel	it wasn't meant with unpolite intent
2009-10-31T04:43:00.000Z	Flannel	KenBW2	th1: Alright
