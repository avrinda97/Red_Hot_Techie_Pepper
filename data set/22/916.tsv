2011-01-17T01:17:00.000Z	w3b		hello all! anybody aware of excluded hp cciss drivers in lucid's netboot files? does the update includes them? thnx..
2011-01-17T01:17:00.000Z	gobbe	w3b	netboot is quite minimal, use server-cd
2011-01-17T01:18:00.000Z	w3b	gobbe	I took that server cd, but lucid seems not supporting the cciss, all other versions do..
2011-01-17T01:19:00.000Z	gobbe	w3b	even from server-cd?
2011-01-17T01:19:00.000Z	w3b		yes
2011-01-17T01:19:00.000Z	w3b		normlly no problems on this
2011-01-17T01:20:00.000Z	w3b		seems vague for a lts version to me..

2011-01-17T01:21:00.000Z	w3b		ok tnx I'll have a look.
2011-01-17T01:24:00.000Z	w3b	gobbe	I took a look but what I mean is probably in earlier stage: while doing a pxe boot with netboot files from the server cd. If I use the cd everything goes well but booting the network doesn't about the dl320 cciss.

2011-01-17T01:24:00.000Z	w3b		sorry for my bad english - I'm working on that (:
2011-01-17T01:24:00.000Z	gobbe	w3b	so you mean that you cannot install anything?
2011-01-17T01:24:00.000Z	w3b		not over the network using pxe
2011-01-17T01:25:00.000Z	w3b		this is only with lucid, maverick works fine
2011-01-17T01:25:00.000Z	gobbe	w3b	so you boot whole machine thru pxe?
2011-01-17T01:25:00.000Z	gobbe	w3b	or just for installation phase?
2011-01-17T01:26:00.000Z	w3b		I'm trying to do an install over the network, created tftpboot with the neboot content of the server cd
2011-01-17T01:26:00.000Z	w3b		normally this goes perfect
2011-01-17T01:26:00.000Z	gobbe	w3b	aah ok, so that's the problem. I thought that you mean that even server cd doesn't have drivers when booting from it
2011-01-17T01:27:00.000Z	w3b		no, I mean the netboot installation
2011-01-17T01:27:00.000Z	gobbe	w3b	ok, i don't know anything about it, so cannot help :-/
