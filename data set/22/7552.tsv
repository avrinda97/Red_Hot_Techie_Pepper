2006-03-12T11:45:00.000Z	frank23	slabby	the basic method:   tar xjvf filename    cd into directory.  read INSTALL and README  ./configure,   make,   sudo checkinstall
2006-03-12T11:46:00.000Z	frank23	slabby	that's assuming its a source package
2006-03-12T11:50:00.000Z	frank23	slabby	the basic method:   tar xjvf filename    cd into directory.  read INSTALL and README  ./configure,   make,   sudo checkinstall
2006-03-12T11:52:00.000Z	frank23	slabby	but in this case, maybe its just  ./setup.sh  once you extract it
2006-03-12T11:53:00.000Z	slabby	frank23	how do i extract it?
2006-03-12T11:54:00.000Z	frank23	slabby	 tar xjvf filename
2006-03-12T11:54:00.000Z	slabby	frank23	but it is .bz2 aswell
2006-03-12T11:54:00.000Z	frank23	slabby	 the j stands for extract bz2

2006-03-12T11:58:00.000Z	frank23	slabby	you're in the right directory and have the right filename?
2006-03-12T11:59:00.000Z	slabby	frank23	yes is on desktop
2006-03-12T12:04:00.000Z	frank23	slabby	yeah no sudo,   sh setup.sh will install it as a user instead
2006-03-12T12:07:00.000Z	frank23	slabby	since you only need to install this program for the current user and not the whole system, install it as a user

2006-03-12T12:08:00.000Z	slabby	frank23	how do i make a shortcut onto the start menu?
