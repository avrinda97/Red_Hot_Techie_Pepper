2006-06-13T06:12:00.000Z	rivethead		oilcat : Dell laptops work really nice with Dapper.
2006-06-13T06:13:00.000Z	olicat	rivethead	aye, they're alright. i use that combo at work, but for home i want something a bit sexier than a dell :)
2006-06-13T06:13:00.000Z	rivethead		oilcat : even sexier than the new XPS ? :P
2006-06-13T06:13:00.000Z	olicat	rivethead	i'm not into dells bulky case design. i'll look up the xps
2006-06-13T06:14:00.000Z	rivethead		oilcat : i do have a friend that run's Dapper on one of the newer model vaio's i can ask him later for you how it works out , you can email me at rivethead@gmail.com
2006-06-13T06:14:00.000Z	olicat	rivethead	i'll drop you a note, thanks a lot
2006-06-13T06:14:00.000Z	rivethead		oilcat : your not looking to get rid of that macbook pro are you ? :)

2006-06-13T06:15:00.000Z	rivethead		oilcat : yeah it is, the Gen2 compacts are quit nice though thats what im on right now.

2006-06-13T06:16:00.000Z	olicat	rivethead	the heat is staggering. i want a laptop i can use on my lap
2006-06-13T06:16:00.000Z	rivethead	olicat	: i have heard that they do run quite hot, i only have one problem with dapper on a laptop really and it doesnt bug me to terribly much.
2006-06-13T06:17:00.000Z	rivethead	olicat	: have you played with any of the other new mac laptops?
2006-06-13T06:18:00.000Z	olicat	rivethead	the 13" i've had a loot at. seems nice, but so did the pro at first
2006-06-13T06:18:00.000Z	rivethead	olicat	: how are they on overall laptop horsepower?
2006-06-13T06:19:00.000Z	olicat	rivethead	it's pretty fast, but i haven't put any other os on it, so nothing to compare it to
2006-06-13T06:20:00.000Z	rivethead	olicat	: out of curiosity which Vaio were you lookin at aquiring?
