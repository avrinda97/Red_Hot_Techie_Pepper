2010-11-12T00:03:00.000Z	IsmAvatar		I'm trying to install updates via Update Manager, but it says that some of the packages are untrusted, and that causes the update to fail. Apparently 'compiz' is untrusted... How do I get past this?
2010-11-12T00:04:00.000Z	harmus	IsmAvatar	uncheck compiz and uncheck the source where you update compiz from, unless it's ubuntu's original source
2010-11-12T00:05:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	harmus	I'm not sure what source it's getting it from. How do I find out?
2010-11-12T00:06:00.000Z	harmus	IsmAvatar	open up synaptic or the update manager and go to settings / sources
2010-11-12T00:07:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	harmus	there's no sources tab
2010-11-12T00:07:00.000Z	harmus	IsmAvatar	there's settings, right?
2010-11-12T00:07:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	harmus	Yes, it opens up the "Software Sources" window with tabs {Ubuntu Software, Other Software, Updates, Authentication, Statistics}
2010-11-12T00:07:00.000Z	harmus	IsmAvatar	 on the updates screen
2010-11-12T00:08:00.000Z	harmus	IsmAvatar	take the second tab
2010-11-12T00:08:00.000Z	harmus	IsmAvatar	Other software
2010-11-12T00:08:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	harmus	done
2010-11-12T00:08:00.000Z	harmus	IsmAvatar	see if you got a source there for compiz
2010-11-12T00:09:00.000Z	harmus	IsmAvatar	if you don't now, run 'sudo apt-get update' in your terminal and check which source is giving you trouble
2010-11-12T00:10:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	harmus	None of them seem to be giving me trouble. None of the ones listed seems to be specifically for compiz. There's Independant, pidgin-dev, pidgen-dev, and Canonical PArtners
2010-11-12T00:12:00.000Z	harmus	IsmAvatar	do you get an error if you run apt-get update, and what error?
2010-11-12T00:12:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	harmus	none. It hits and igns a bunch of stuff. Ign all the translation stuff.
2010-11-12T00:14:00.000Z	harmus	IsmAvatar	i'm not sure then, update without updating compiz and check back later; maybe someone can tell you more
2010-11-12T00:15:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	harmus	the problem isn't just compiz. It's almost all of them are reporting that most of the stuff is untrusted
2010-11-12T00:15:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	harmus	hang on... it seems to be doing something now
2010-11-12T00:15:00.000Z	harmus	IsmAvatar	then you probably need to reimport the keys for the ubuntu servers
2010-11-12T00:16:00.000Z	harmus	IsmAvatar	or a temporary error
2010-11-12T00:16:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	harmus	it seems to have fixed itself. Temporary error.
