2008-07-16T08:17:00.000Z	ubuntucool555		I have a 500 GB Western Digital External Hard Drive connected to a VMware Server Virtual Machine (I have checked in vmware removable devices and it says its mounted) On a Ubuntu host. When i do sudo fdisk -l on the Server Virtual Machine it doesn't show up. Help anyone?
2008-07-16T08:18:00.000Z	Peebo	ubuntucool555	Ur as clear as mud, is it the Vmachine or the real machine that can't see the drive
2008-07-16T08:18:00.000Z	ubuntucool555	Peebo	The Virtual Machine
2008-07-16T08:18:00.000Z	Peebo		you have to configure it in the vmware console before the vmachine will see it
2008-07-16T08:19:00.000Z	ubuntucool555	Peebo	I already have. The Virtual Machine sees USB printers connected to it but not the external hard drive
2008-07-16T08:21:00.000Z	Peebo	ubuntucool555	I'll just check my wmware stuff now
2008-07-16T08:21:00.000Z	ubuntucool555	Peebo	When the VM starts up i get these errors: usb 1-1: device descriptor read/64, error -84
2008-07-16T08:27:00.000Z	Peebo	ubuntucool555	Ok I just added a USB controller to my Ubuntu Vmachine
2008-07-16T08:27:00.000Z	Peebo		Booting it now
2008-07-16T08:28:00.000Z	Peebo		AMD Quadcore 9750 with 4 gig RAM on Ubuntu 8.04 64bit : VMware running OX-Xchange; Windoze XP pro and Ubuntu 8.04 32 bit desktop
2008-07-16T08:29:00.000Z	Peebo		O-Xchange
2008-07-16T08:29:00.000Z	Peebo		Open Xchange groupware server
2008-07-16T08:29:00.000Z	Peebo		runs on to of Ubuntu 7
2008-07-16T08:29:00.000Z	Peebo		\on top
2008-07-16T08:34:00.000Z	Peebo	ubuntucool555	U there ?
2008-07-16T08:34:00.000Z	ubuntucool555	Peebo	Yes
2008-07-16T08:35:00.000Z	Peebo		Ok start your vmachine then in the VM menu on your vmware console choose removeable devices then USB devices then your usb drive
2008-07-16T08:37:00.000Z	ubuntucool555	Peebo	Just installing VMware tools to see if that fixed the problem -- i have already selected the drive in the vmware menu
2008-07-16T08:38:00.000Z	Peebo	ubuntucool555	 For some reason my USB drive does not show up in the vmware removable devices menu hmmm
2008-07-16T08:38:00.000Z	Peebo	ubuntucool555	 Even tho the actual Ubuntu box finds it
2008-07-16T08:40:00.000Z	Peebo		I'm an Ubuntu fan except for the STUPID names so I'm running Ubuntu 8.04 not HH
2008-07-16T08:46:00.000Z	Peebo	ubuntucool555	Sorry can't help you more until I get VMWare recognising my USB drive. L8R
