2009-04-02T19:08:00.000Z	Enpires	LjL	can you help me with my problems with GRUB
2009-04-02T19:09:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	if you explain them to me, perhaps
2009-04-02T19:09:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	although i'm not so familiar with GRUB to be honest, i only use a very simple configuration for it
2009-04-02T19:09:00.000Z	Enpires	LjL	the problem is that i cant choos any OS at startup :D
2009-04-02T19:10:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	elaborate?
2009-04-02T19:11:00.000Z	Enpires	LjL	ok. when i start my computer i see my ASUS logo, after (when i ususally shoose what OS i want to start) i can only see a flashing line
2009-04-02T19:11:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	so basically GRUB isn't even starting?
2009-04-02T19:11:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	do you get a prompt?
2009-04-02T19:12:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	can you boot from a live cd or something?
2009-04-02T19:13:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	where is your root partition currently mounted?
2009-04-02T19:13:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	and what is it called?
2009-04-02T19:14:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	well, you pasted your menu.lst so your root partition must be mounted *somewhere*. how did you open menu.lst?
2009-04-02T19:15:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	wouldn't that be /media/DATA/ubuntu/dists/boot/grub?
2009-04-02T19:15:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	look, type "mount" and pastebin the output
2009-04-02T19:16:00.000Z	Enpires	LjL	http://paste.ubuntu.com/142821/
2009-04-02T19:17:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	err? do you have your Ubuntu installed on a *Windows* (NTFS) partition?!
2009-04-02T19:17:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	ah, i see. i don't know anything about how Wubi works, but it's likely entirely different from a normal install
2009-04-02T19:18:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	well i'm sorry but i don't think i have the slighest idea how to fix GRUB on a Wubi install
2009-04-02T19:19:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	the instructions i was about to give you may likely just break it further
2009-04-02T19:21:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	sebsebseb: besides, as far as i know, Wubi doesn't use GRUB to start Windows - it just adds an entry to Windows' boot.ini - its own bootloader. so the problem might be there and not in GRUB at all
2009-04-02T19:21:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	not that i can see
2009-04-02T19:22:00.000Z	LjL	Enpires	i would try that, yes - also try asking here again every 10 minutes or so (not more often than that), but be sure to specify you're on wubi
