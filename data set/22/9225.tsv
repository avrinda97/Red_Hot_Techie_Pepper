2005-01-28T10:00:00.000Z	heliolith		thanks neo... digitalstatic: checking to paste... sec
2005-01-28T10:00:00.000Z	maximaus	heliolith	just edit your fstab and the ntfs drive will mount on boot
2005-01-28T10:02:00.000Z	maximaus	heliolith	I just make a symlink to the desktop
2005-01-28T10:04:00.000Z	maximaus	heliolith	a symlink is just a file that points to something.
2005-01-28T10:05:00.000Z	maximaus	heliolith	yeah, been so long since I used windows I forgot the term LOL
2005-01-28T10:06:00.000Z	maximaus	heliolith	for example I have a symlink in my home called "mp3" which is linked to /home/mp3 which is used by all users of my box.
2005-01-28T10:42:00.000Z	heliolith	maximaus	how can I make a symlink from say, my desktop to /mnt/windows/Documents and Settings/Michael/Desktop
2005-01-28T10:43:00.000Z	maximaus	heliolith	drag and drop with the middle mouse button (wheel)
2005-01-28T10:44:00.000Z	maximaus	heliolith	took me a long time to find that shortcut.
2005-01-28T10:45:00.000Z	maximaus	heliolith	you may want to look into installing a traditional two pane file manager for managing large amounts of stuff. I like Emelfm for those types of tasks.
2005-01-28T10:46:00.000Z	heliolith	maximaus	i'd have never found it! okies on the emelfm... do you have a default location you usually install programs to?  This is my first day on Linux.  Ever.
2005-01-28T10:47:00.000Z	heliolith	maximaus	well, firefox for example I have installed to /home/michael/firefox-installer/firefox which doesn't intuitively seem correct
2005-01-28T10:48:00.000Z	maximaus	heliolith	that's pretty smart if not traditional, I do a similar thing: install a lot of stuff to /home/software.
2005-01-28T10:53:00.000Z	heliolith	maximaus	what about opening sub-folders in the same window, rather than a new one?  is there an easy way to change that preference?
2005-01-28T10:53:00.000Z	maximaus	heliolith	try double clicking with the middle mouse button ;)
2005-01-28T10:54:00.000Z	heliolith	maximaus	ty (= it's a wheel, but it still works
2005-01-28T10:54:00.000Z	maximaus	heliolith	I've set my file manager to one button click so middle click replaces window, left opens new window.
2005-01-28T10:54:00.000Z	maximaus	heliolith	yeah double clicking on the wheel is a bit wierd LOL
2005-01-28T10:54:00.000Z	heliolith	maximaus	excellent; doing so now
2005-01-28T10:55:00.000Z	maximaus	heliolith	you can change the file manager to work in a more traditional manner with a menubar and forward back buttons or such, OR right click on a folder and choose "browse".
2005-01-28T10:56:00.000Z	heliolith	maximaus	ah, I get it =P
