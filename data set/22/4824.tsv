2007-09-29T15:50:00.000Z	scguy318	ashley1	yes
2007-09-29T15:50:00.000Z	scguy318	ashley1	and it's Debian
2007-09-29T15:52:00.000Z	scguy318	ashley1	System -> Administration -> Synaptic
2007-09-30T08:08:00.000Z	scguy318	ashley1	gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
2007-09-30T08:08:00.000Z	scguy318	ashley1	or sudo nano /etc/fstab
2007-09-30T08:15:00.000Z	scguy318	ashley1	sudo mv source dest
2007-09-30T08:17:00.000Z	ashley1	scguy318	its telling me that the sda1 device is busy
2007-09-30T08:18:00.000Z	ashley1	scguy318	when i try to move /media/sda1 to /mnt it tells me the device is already busy
2007-09-30T08:18:00.000Z	scguy318	ashley1	why would you want to do that?
2007-09-30T08:19:00.000Z	scguy318	ashley1	if you want to change the mount point that's not what you should do
2007-09-30T08:19:00.000Z	scguy318	ashley1	you should sudo umount /media/sda1 then re-mount the device to /mnt
2007-09-30T08:20:00.000Z	ashley1	scguy318	its telling me that sda1 is not mounted
