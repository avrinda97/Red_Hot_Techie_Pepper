2004-12-02T17:27:00.000Z	sivang	Gmail	: you should have it installed under your /home/$user - this is supported by the java tarballs
2004-12-02T17:27:00.000Z	sivang	Gmail	: that way you won't taint your system, and be able to neatly remove when you suddenly want to :)
2004-12-02T17:27:00.000Z	Gmail	sivang	but i want it system wide
2004-12-02T17:27:00.000Z	sivang	Gmail	: just make classpath= and jdk= point to the right places.
2004-12-02T17:28:00.000Z	Gmail		ok
2004-12-02T17:28:00.000Z	sivang	Gmail	: it can be used system wide like this, just put the right envars in a system wide location, just leave the actual execs on your home folder./
2004-12-02T17:28:00.000Z	Gmail		so $home/.java
2004-12-02T17:28:00.000Z	sivang	Gmail	: yes, I think there is something on the web the explains how to do that.
2004-12-02T17:28:00.000Z	Gmail	sivang	no it can't i don't allow other user into my home folder
2004-12-02T17:29:00.000Z	sivang	Gmail	: I myself have a working installation of NetBeans, together with an install of the jdk under my home
2004-12-02T17:29:00.000Z	sivang	Gmail	: All other users have only exec permissioss to it, and you can also make a symlink from somewhere in /usr...
2004-12-02T17:30:00.000Z	sivang	Gmail	: but if you wat to have a system wide install, lemme check something.
