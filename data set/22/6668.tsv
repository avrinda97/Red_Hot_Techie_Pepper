2007-05-18T05:09:00.000Z	macogw	LadyNikon	assume you're the same one from #linuxchix?
2007-05-18T05:09:00.000Z	LadyNikon	macogw	:)
2007-05-18T05:18:00.000Z	macogw	LadyNikon	well gnome lets me irssi in gnome-terminal...
2007-05-18T05:18:00.000Z	LadyNikon	macogw	*cough* what? ;)
2007-05-18T05:19:00.000Z	macogw	LadyNikon	and the usual lag when trying to get on #linuxchix is there when I use irssi in xterm...
2007-05-18T05:19:00.000Z	LadyNikon	macogw	heh
2007-05-18T05:19:00.000Z	LadyNikon	macogw	i heard there is a keybinding to use
2007-05-18T05:19:00.000Z	macogw	LadyNikon	except that the lag is being a bit longer than usual I think...
2007-05-18T05:20:00.000Z	macogw	LadyNikon	oh wait it connected now....that identd thing takes FOREVER to time out
2007-05-18T05:20:00.000Z	LadyNikon	macogw	odd
2007-05-18T05:21:00.000Z	macogw	LadyNikon	hey maybe that's why I can't use the password set thingy in pidgin....the server spends so long trying to connect it gets the password before it requests it
2007-05-18T05:22:00.000Z	macogw	LadyNikon	can we smack Quintin?
