2008-01-13T17:32:00.000Z	pawleeq		Hi, my 7.1 sudenly started to move with mouse cursor when i switch applications with alt-tab etc.... please how to disable this atrocity? thx
2008-01-13T17:33:00.000Z	RAdams	pawleeq	7.10, not 7.1, and do you mean the focus follows the windows, or the mouse cursor arbitrarily moves?
2008-01-13T17:34:00.000Z	pawleeq	RAdams	when I switch between 2 windows (doesnt matter which) curtsoc moves to upper right corner
2008-01-13T17:35:00.000Z	RAdams	pawleeq	Gnome or KDE, and do you have Compiz or Beryl active?
2008-01-13T17:35:00.000Z	pawleeq	RAdams	Gnome, compiz fusion
2008-01-13T17:36:00.000Z	RAdams	pawleeq	disable desktop effects. Does it still happen?
2008-01-13T17:37:00.000Z	pawleeq	RAdams	disabling desktop effects also disables this
2008-01-13T17:37:00.000Z	RAdams	pawleeq	do you have compizconfig-settings-manager installed?
2008-01-13T17:38:00.000Z	pawleeq	RAdams	yes
2008-01-13T17:38:00.000Z	RAdams	pawleeq	backup your config under prefs in ccsm and reset to defaults. Does the problem still happen>?
2008-01-13T17:38:00.000Z	pawleeq	RAdams	mmt
2008-01-13T17:40:00.000Z	pawleeq	RAdams	no
2008-01-13T17:43:00.000Z	RAdams	pawleeq	then restore your settings, and check through the window preferences and see if there's a specific setting misconfigured. You've successsfully determined it's your config causing the problem
2008-01-13T17:43:00.000Z	RAdams	pawleeq	I would start with advanced search in ccsm and search "cursor" or "mouse"
2008-01-13T17:44:00.000Z	pawleeq	RAdams	thanks very much I do not have fine tuned profile in compiz so I will easily tune the default one
2008-01-13T17:45:00.000Z	RAdams	pawleeq	yeah, that's the easiest way :)
2008-01-13T17:45:00.000Z	pawleeq	RAdams	nevertheless I find it quite strange, becuase there was nothing like this happening yeasterday...
2008-01-13T17:46:00.000Z	RAdams	pawleeq	that is strange. See if it happens again, but back up your settings each time you make a change in ccsm. That way, when it does happen, you can use compdiff and see what's being corrupted in your compiz settings file
2008-01-13T17:46:00.000Z	RAdams	pawleeq	if you get that level of information, report a launchpad bug
2008-01-13T17:47:00.000Z	pawleeq	RAdams	might my previous expewriments with KDE4 coused this (I doubt, but thats only reasonable explanation I can think of...)
2008-01-13T17:48:00.000Z	RAdams	pawleeq	it's possible, I suppose
2008-01-13T17:49:00.000Z	pawleeq	RAdams	well thx for support and have a nice day:)
