2008-06-14T11:51:00.000Z	HardDisk	bullgard4	also if you type whereis name_of_application it will give you its location
2008-06-14T11:52:00.000Z	bullgard4	HardDisk	"detlef@MD97600:~$ whereis Tunapie; Tunapie:" (empty)
2008-06-14T11:53:00.000Z	HardDisk	bullgard4	is it run with a T? or t
2008-06-14T11:53:00.000Z	HardDisk	bullgard4	whereis works best if you do sudo updatedb and that the application is installed via deb or repositories
2008-06-14T11:53:00.000Z	bullgard4	HardDisk	In both direcotries Tunapie is displayes with a capital first letter.
2008-06-14T11:54:00.000Z	HardDisk	bullgard4	I didn't say folder, I meant the actual application
2008-06-14T11:55:00.000Z	bullgard4	HardDisk	All my applications on this computer are installed via Ubuntu repositories. This morning at 07:35 local time my computer did automatically run 'updatedb'.
2008-06-14T11:55:00.000Z	HardDisk	bullgard4	I missed what the problem you are having exactly.
2008-06-14T11:56:00.000Z	bullgard4	HardDisk	Why are there two desktop configuration files: /usr/share/app-install/desktop/Tunapie and /usr/share/applications/Tunapie?
2008-06-14T11:57:00.000Z	HardDisk	bullgard4	one is the link one is the location of the binary.
2008-06-14T12:06:00.000Z	bullgard4	HardDisk	mc does not indicate that one of the two files tunapie.desktop is a link.
2008-06-14T12:07:00.000Z	HardDisk	bullgard4	I assume, since not all applications are identically the same way of how they are located.
2008-06-14T12:12:00.000Z	bullgard4	HardDisk	I do not know how to put to use your message.
2008-06-14T12:12:00.000Z	HardDisk	bullgard4	I don't quite get you..
2008-06-14T12:14:00.000Z	bullgard4	HardDisk	I read your message: "I assume, since not all applications are identically the same way of how they are located." but I do not understand if there is any meaningful contents in it. Please say it in other words.
2008-06-14T12:15:00.000Z	HardDisk	bullgard4	I mean, different applications are located differently.
2008-06-14T12:25:00.000Z	bullgard4	HardDisk	I am speaking about one and the same application: The name of the application is 'Tunapie'.
2008-06-14T12:26:00.000Z	HardDisk	bullgard4	not familiar with Tunapie sorry.
2008-06-14T12:27:00.000Z	HardDisk	bullgard4	I do know its location is /usr/share/tunapie/
2008-06-14T12:35:00.000Z	bullgard4	HardDisk	You missed the point: I took 'Tunapie' only as an example. If you do not know Tunapie, you still could answer my question if you were knowledgeable enough.
2008-06-14T12:37:00.000Z	HardDisk	bullgard4	as I said, different applications install differently, as far as tunapie all I know is that the location of the application resides in /usr/share/tunapie/ , I am a volunteer like anyone else, I'm not a guru, thank you.
2008-06-14T12:38:00.000Z	HardDisk	bullgard4	and tenX any discussions please take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
