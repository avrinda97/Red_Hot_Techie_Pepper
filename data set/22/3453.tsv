2011-12-22T12:16:00.000Z	OvermindDL1	dr_willis	I have tried ubuntu drivers, foss drivers, amd drivers, all make no change in the locking up
2011-12-22T12:17:00.000Z	OvermindDL1	dr_willis	And nothing ever clears it?
2011-12-22T12:18:00.000Z	OvermindDL1	dr_willis	I have a 5850 laying about, do you think that would make a difference or not?
2011-12-22T12:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	OvermindDL1	 nwver really tried. thus was 6+ yrs ago
2011-12-22T12:18:00.000Z	OvermindDL1	dr_willis	I am quite certain the 3870 is fine as it ran other OS's fine...
2011-12-22T12:19:00.000Z	OvermindDL1	dr_willis	Not my option unfortunetly...
2011-12-22T12:30:00.000Z	OvermindDL1	dr_willis	Kind of out of hard drives space, hence my really wanting a new hd....
2011-12-22T12:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	OvermindDL1	 unity wants 3d video support. and your setup is somehow not doing it right
2011-12-22T12:52:00.000Z	OvermindDL1	dr_willis	I definitely have 3d, games run just fine and very fast for example...
2011-12-22T12:52:00.000Z	OvermindDL1	dr_willis	Does it make a log anywhere?
2011-12-22T12:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	OvermindDL1	 not sure.  unity 2d works on my netbook. but not unity.
2011-12-22T12:53:00.000Z	OvermindDL1	dr_willis	No netbook here, 6 physical cores, 16 gigs ram, radeon 3870 video card, and get well over 100fps in minecraft, orcs must die, etc...
2011-12-22T12:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	OvermindDL1	 see if it works on a live cd?
2011-12-22T12:54:00.000Z	OvermindDL1	dr_willis	No cd drive, removed it to add more hard drives...
2011-12-22T12:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	OvermindDL1	 so make a live flash
2011-12-22T12:54:00.000Z	OvermindDL1	dr_willis	And no, no usb drives, I need to get some...
2011-12-22T12:55:00.000Z	OvermindDL1	dr_willis	It can do that?!
2011-12-22T12:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	OvermindDL1	 grub2 can boot  ubuntu iso files.. yes
2011-12-22T12:56:00.000Z	OvermindDL1	dr_willis	Pretty sure I am still using grub1...
2011-12-22T12:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	OvermindDL1	 so we are back to.... time to reinstall.. that may fix it all
2011-12-22T12:57:00.000Z	OvermindDL1	dr_willis	Yeah, leaning ever more that way...
