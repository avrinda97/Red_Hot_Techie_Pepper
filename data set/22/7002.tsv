2007-02-18T13:58:00.000Z	jrib	chalcedony	no "run"
2007-02-18T14:08:00.000Z	chalcedony	jrib	does open office have an image editor .. i remember using something or does draw rotate the image of a page i scanned and let me change it?
2007-02-18T14:09:00.000Z	jrib	chalcedony	I think draw is it, but I have no experience with it
2007-02-18T14:09:00.000Z	chalcedony	jrib	ok ty .. wonder who does?
2007-02-18T14:10:00.000Z	chalcedony	jrib	 could i use something else in xsane for that?
2007-02-18T14:10:00.000Z	jrib	chalcedony	you can try #users.openoffice.org   But why not use the GIMP to edit the image?
2007-02-18T14:11:00.000Z	chalcedony	jrib	the GIMP would probably do if i have enough ram in this computer, i've never done anything so it's all new to me
