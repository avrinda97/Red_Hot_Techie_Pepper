2008-02-07T20:51:00.000Z	Dimitree		any Bible software for ubuntu ? =)
2008-02-07T20:53:00.000Z	jamesm	Dimitree	Yup There is a CE for Ubuntu -- great package base for first timers that are introducing a system to children.  I have installed it on numerous systems here in town for families
2008-02-07T21:10:00.000Z	Dimitree	jamesm	is it possible to get the "complete jewish bible" for GnomeSword ? o-o
2008-02-07T21:12:00.000Z	jamesm	Dimitree	That is questions I have not been asked before --  I am guessing here, but your not just looking for translation into Hebrew -- your actually looking for a version of the "Jewish Bible" for that app?
2008-02-07T21:13:00.000Z	Dimitree	jamesm	i used Bible study software when i was in windows and it had a Complete Jewish Bible with OT and NT with original names and so on and it would be great if i can somehow use it on linux o-o
2008-02-07T21:14:00.000Z	jamesm	Dimitree	ahh  I see
2008-02-07T21:15:00.000Z	jamesm	Dimitree	What was the name of the software you used ?
2008-02-07T21:16:00.000Z	Dimitree	jamesm	PC Study Bible from biblesoft.com
2008-02-07T21:19:00.000Z	Dimitree	jamesm	 this is what i'm after http://www.messianicjewish.net/jntp/complete-jewish-bible.html
2008-02-07T21:20:00.000Z	jamesm	Dimitree	Give me second -- I am looking at some old notes I had from a customer last Summer.  I even have the CD around this mess somewhere...we got the program working with Wine with very little trouble.
2008-02-07T21:21:00.000Z	Dimitree	jamesm	 ok :)
2008-02-07T21:31:00.000Z	jamesm	Dimitree	well that app doesn't have a Jewish port...but I did find something else - checked into e-sword and found j-sword with alot of mods...looking for something now
2008-02-07T21:32:00.000Z	Dimitree	jamesm	what do you mean jewish port ?
2008-02-07T21:33:00.000Z	Dimitree	jamesm	i need that bible in english ? :)
2008-02-07T21:34:00.000Z	Dimitree	jamesm	btw any idea if i can maby search for that bible and find it in some format will i be able to convert it to a usable format for gnome sword ?
2008-02-07T21:34:00.000Z	Dimitree	jamesm	are there tools to do such things ?
2008-02-07T21:36:00.000Z	jamesm	Dimitree	Technically since gnomesword is GPL you could by all rights import the bible YOU want to study and hack the code accordingly.  On the gnome-sword site there is a bit of information on doing this (in regards to the current installed Bible) but it would take some research
2008-02-07T21:37:00.000Z	Dimitree	jamesm	 ok thank you very much ! :)
2008-02-07T21:38:00.000Z	jamesm	Dimitree	The cool thing about a community driven app like Gnome-Sword is that people would respond and you could probably get it done in a relatively short timeframe
2008-02-07T21:38:00.000Z	jamesm	Dimitree	Honestly I would just user your exsisting software and port it with WINE
2008-02-07T21:38:00.000Z	Dimitree	jamesm	well i hope i will have luck :)
2008-02-07T21:39:00.000Z	Dimitree	jamesm	ok i will try that aswell thank you :)
