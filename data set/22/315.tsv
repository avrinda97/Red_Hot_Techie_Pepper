2011-12-30T06:34:00.000Z	ubuntuser1		hello Ive been having problems trying to install the hp deskjet 3050 j610 because the driver is not found. Anyone has any experience working out this issue_
2011-12-30T06:35:00.000Z	reisio	ubuntuser1	install hplip and hplip-gui
2011-12-30T06:35:00.000Z	reisio	ubuntuser1	might be what you need
2011-12-30T06:36:00.000Z	ubuntuser1	reisio	thans
2011-12-30T06:44:00.000Z	ubuntuser1	reisio	I just installed the hplip-gui and hplip but cannot get the printer to work. It says that the driver is missing
2011-12-30T06:44:00.000Z	ubuntuser1	reisio	do you have any suggestions?
2011-12-30T06:46:00.000Z	reisio	ubuntuser1	is it an all-in-one?
2011-12-30T06:46:00.000Z	ubuntuser1	reisio	yes
2011-12-30T06:46:00.000Z	reisio	ubuntuser1	well that's supported by hplip
2011-12-30T06:47:00.000Z	reisio	ubuntuser1	what Ubuntu version are you on?
2011-12-30T06:47:00.000Z	ubuntuser1	reisio	10.04 LTS
2011-12-30T06:48:00.000Z	reisio	ubuntuser1	ah, okay
2011-12-30T06:48:00.000Z	reisio	ubuntuser1	you need a slightly newer version of hplip
2011-12-30T06:48:00.000Z	reisio	ubuntuser1	3.10.9 or higher to be specific
2011-12-30T06:48:00.000Z	ubuntuser1	reisio	how can I get it?
2011-12-30T06:48:00.000Z	reisio	ubuntuser1	upgrading to 11.04 or higher would manage it, otherwise you'd have to attempt to use a more recent hplip alone
2011-12-30T06:50:00.000Z	ubuntuser1	reisio	I tried to upgrade but after updating from the update manager I cannot see the option to do an upgrade. I also tried doing apt-get dist-upgrade but got nothing :(
2011-12-30T06:50:00.000Z	reisio	ubuntuser1	well that's a problem someone else in the channel will have to help you with
2011-12-30T06:51:00.000Z	ubuntuser1	reisio	thanks
2011-12-30T06:56:00.000Z	ubuntuser1	reisio	would you recommend upgrading to 12.04?
2011-12-30T06:57:00.000Z	reisio	ubuntuser1	insofar as it would make available to you the hplip version you require
2011-12-30T07:00:00.000Z	ubuntuser1	reisio	thanks
