2010-11-01T17:54:00.000Z	replicasex		it's rather irritating that my isp won't let me hook up a modem that I own and use that >_>
2010-11-01T17:55:00.000Z	rusivi	replicasex	If your in US, who is your ISP?
2010-11-01T17:55:00.000Z	replicasex		Charter :(
2010-11-01T17:55:00.000Z	replicasex		Big ol' cable company rusivi
2010-11-01T17:56:00.000Z	replicasex		I have two computers here, neither have wifi cards (I didn't get one for mine and the other is rather old) ... yeah, I wanted both to be connected but apparently what I said was "charge me for another line"
2010-11-01T17:57:00.000Z	rusivi	replicasex	I'm an ISP'er, usually they have something called a "custmod" that allows customers to use their own modem. However, it was my understanding they are required to allow it due to FCC competitive purposes.
2010-11-01T17:57:00.000Z	rusivi	replicasex	One of these for TV CableCards called Seperable Security (US Law governing it)
2010-11-01T17:58:00.000Z	replicasex	rusivi	maybe >_>  I connected it up but it won't go and tries to load into their silly isp install, obviously this modem is somehow not authorized
2010-11-01T17:58:00.000Z	rusivi	replicasex	Yes you have to call Charter and request that they authorize it.
2010-11-01T17:58:00.000Z	replicasex	rusivi	do you know if they have to have a technician come over or?
2010-11-01T17:58:00.000Z	replicasex	rusivi	worried they'll just "add another line" instead and charge me double
2010-11-01T17:58:00.000Z	replicasex		they're real jerks
2010-11-01T17:58:00.000Z	rusivi	replicasex	Usually you just return any eq they gave you and they just send a signal down without a site visit.
2010-11-01T17:59:00.000Z	replicasex	rusivi	yeah returned the second one but I need to use two different ones.  I should call them but I hate talking to them >_>
2010-11-01T18:00:00.000Z	replicasex	rusivi	my expectations were basically that the whole house has the signal coming to it so why couldn't I just add an extra? :P
2010-11-01T18:01:00.000Z	rusivi	replicasex	That's nice you feel that way but if you want to add it, you have to call ur ISP and ask them to authorize it ;)
2010-11-01T18:01:00.000Z	replicasex	rusivi	any idea if that costs money or not?  Pretty sure the modem is up to snuff, it's a few years old but I think it's perfectly capable
2010-11-01T18:02:00.000Z	rusivi	replicasex	It's a no cost transaction. As well, if your ISP is using DOCSIS 3.0 (newest standard) and your modem is only DOCSIS 1.1 you may not get fastest speeds. Anyway you slice it, have to call and ask Charter.
2010-11-01T18:02:00.000Z	replicasex	rusivi	alas alas :(
2010-11-01T18:04:00.000Z	replicasex	rusivi	i'm kinda curious, do they just flick a switch and have the signal ungate?
2010-11-01T18:05:00.000Z	rusivi	replicasex	Pretty much it's just a couple clicks of the mouse/keyboard.
2010-11-01T18:10:00.000Z	replicasex	rusivi	I'm not usually the decision-y making one/pay the bills guy (I'm 20 hah) and I was totally distraught at them (charter) charging for a whole extra line.  really burned me out
