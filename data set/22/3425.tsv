2008-09-24T00:39:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	nkei0	That's a name resolving issue, DNS... check the name servers being assigned to the network interface
2008-09-24T00:40:00.000Z	nkei0	IntuitiveNipple	How do I manage that?  I'm still a newbie.
2008-09-24T00:42:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	nkei0	If the WiFi interface is managed by NetworkManager, it will get the IP address and DNS servers to use from the router. If the DNS server setting is not a good server, or the lcoal system has conflicting manual entries that aren't good, you'll get long delays when browsing web-sites as it repeatedly tries to resolve names to IP addresses and times out waiting
2008-09-24T00:42:00.000Z	nkei0	IntuitiveNipple	So how do I fix that?
2008-09-24T00:43:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	nkei0	Check what DNS server the router is giving out, and what the local settings are: cat /etc/resolv.conf
2008-09-24T05:16:00.000Z	nkei0	IntuitiveNipple	You there?
2008-09-24T05:17:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	nkei0	yeah, but I'm involved in a tricky system recovery right now
2008-09-24T05:17:00.000Z	nkei0	IntuitiveNipple	Ahh, alright I'll look elsewhere then.
2008-09-24T05:19:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	nkei0	no luck with the slow DNS look-ups then?
2008-09-24T05:20:00.000Z	nkei0	IntuitiveNipple	I just got back a little bit ago, but you're correct.  No luck, i've reset cable receiver and router and even reset all of the defaults and went back through the settings and made sure it was all good.
2008-09-24T05:20:00.000Z	nkei0	IntuitiveNipple	So, it gotta be something to do with this laptop or Ubuntu
2008-09-24T05:23:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	nkei0	Or your upstream DNS server that your router is using.
2008-09-24T05:24:00.000Z	nkei0	IntuitiveNipple	How do I change that?
2008-09-24T05:24:00.000Z	nkei0	IntuitiveNipple	Or even check that...?
2008-09-24T05:27:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	nkei0	In your router, there will be information on the DNS server it is using
2008-09-24T05:37:00.000Z	nkei0	IntuitiveNipple	So, I checked out my router, found it and performed a dhcp release/renew so even with the new dns servers it's still slow
2008-09-24T05:38:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	nkei0	do you have other PCs on the LAN that suffer the same slowness?
2008-09-24T05:38:00.000Z	nkei0	IntuitiveNipple	Oh, actually it worked the second time I did it, sweet thanks for the help!
2008-09-24T05:39:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	nkei0	It's fixed? not slow?
2008-09-24T05:39:00.000Z	nkei0	IntuitiveNipple	Appears so.
2008-09-24T05:40:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	nkei0	Yay :D
