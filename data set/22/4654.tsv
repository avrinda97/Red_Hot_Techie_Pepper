2007-11-26T06:30:00.000Z	tyronepolleri	Pelo	how can I delete the /.wine directory?
2007-11-26T06:31:00.000Z	Pelo	tyronepolleri	go to your home folder , type crtl+h to see the hidden folders and you can then find it and delete it like anyother file or folder
2007-11-26T06:35:00.000Z	Pelo	tyronepolleri	menu > system > prefs > main menu
2007-12-08T06:49:00.000Z	Pelo	tyronepolleri	 didyou install xgl ?
2007-12-08T06:50:00.000Z	tyronepolleri	Pelo	yesI have xgl
2007-12-08T07:00:00.000Z	Pelo	tyronepolleri	 a distro is when someone makes a working linux system with kernel , gui and other apps.  technicaly you could think of windows as a distro of the MS operating system,  but linux distros tend to come fully loaded
2007-12-08T07:01:00.000Z	Pelo	tyronepolleri	 when someone make it for distribution that is
2007-12-08T07:03:00.000Z	Pelo	tyronepolleri	0.7 beta of what ?
2007-12-08T07:04:00.000Z	tyronepolleri	Pelo	infinitycircuit told me if you want compiz fusion to work you need to upgrade to the betas of 0.7
2007-12-08T07:04:00.000Z	Pelo	tyronepolleri	infinity was not correct, what version of ubuntu are you running atm ?
2007-12-08T07:05:00.000Z	tyronepolleri	Pelo	7.10
2007-12-08T07:05:00.000Z	Pelo	tyronepolleri	 ok compiz is default in gutsy which is what you have,  you're the one with the intel video card right ?
2007-12-08T07:06:00.000Z	Pelo	tyronepolleri	 and xgl not working properly
2007-12-08T07:07:00.000Z	tyronepolleri	Pelo	yes intel 965 it is in the black list
2007-12-08T07:07:00.000Z	Pelo	tyronepolleri	in the blacklist ? you blacklisted your video driver ? why ?
2007-12-08T07:09:00.000Z	tyronepolleri	Pelo	no I mean it is there by default
2007-12-08T07:10:00.000Z	Pelo	tyronepolleri	as far as I know you should be able to run at least the basic desktop effects with an intel card, mine can handle them and it's a 865,  anything over that is a bit over my head,  you should try asking in #compiz-fusion,   I don't think you will need to install any beta of anything,  but I might be wrong ,  they will be able to tell you
