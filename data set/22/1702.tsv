2010-02-11T15:08:00.000Z	H2S	darolu	that's not the program because apt-get says it doesnt exist
2010-02-11T15:09:00.000Z	darolu	H2S	try kwalletmanager-kde4
2010-02-11T15:10:00.000Z	H2S	darolu	still not installed
2010-02-11T15:13:00.000Z	darolu	H2S	It may be integrated with KDE-base-runtime; all I can think of is disabling it, that way it won't bother you anymore; try "/usr/bin/kwalletmanager --show
2010-02-11T15:14:00.000Z	H2S	darolu	bash: /usr/bin/kwalletmanager: No such file or directory
2010-02-11T15:15:00.000Z	darolu	H2S	uhmm I suppose it changed with KDE 4, well open it the way you know and browse preferences; it has a disable kwallet option.
2010-02-11T15:16:00.000Z	darolu	H2S	That's all I can think of right now, =(
2010-02-11T15:19:00.000Z	H2S	darolu	Bushman: I cant open kdewallet its just constantly prompting me for a password every time i do anything in a program I'm using
2010-02-11T15:20:00.000Z	darolu	H2S	I'm reading KDE4 forums, seems like the best way to stop the annoyance is to set a blank password, and hit on "allow always" when it jumps.
2010-02-11T15:21:00.000Z	darolu	H2S	You don't have it under KMenu > System Settings > Advanced > KDE Wallet?
2010-02-11T15:21:00.000Z	H2S	darolu	im in gnome
2010-02-11T15:22:00.000Z	darolu	H2S	can you summon it with Alt+F2?

2010-02-11T15:25:00.000Z	H2S	darolu	there's no trace of this thing on my system
2010-02-11T15:25:00.000Z	darolu	H2S	Do you use Kopete or any other KDE application?
