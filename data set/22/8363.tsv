2005-11-28T08:11:00.000Z	intelikey		anyone know where the official #gentoo is ?   what server ?
2005-11-28T08:11:00.000Z	Phuzion	intelikey	 It's here, just /j #gentoo
2006-06-01T09:55:00.000Z	intelikey	Phuzion	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list (change all breezy to dapper) && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && echo success || echo failed.
2006-06-01T09:57:00.000Z	intelikey	Phuzion	the fully automatic way.                                                                                      sed 's/breezy/dapper/g' /etc/apt/sources.list > sources.list && sudo cp sources.list /etc/apt/ && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && echo success || echo failed.
2006-06-01T10:01:00.000Z	intelikey	Phuzion	pastebin your sources.list
2006-06-01T10:01:00.000Z	Phuzion	intelikey	 how do I copy from PuTTY?
2006-06-01T10:02:00.000Z	intelikey	Phuzion	mouse ?
2006-06-01T10:02:00.000Z	Phuzion	intelikey	 Yeah
2006-06-01T10:06:00.000Z	Phuzion	intelikey	 http://pastebin.com/750566 is my sources.list
2006-06-01T10:08:00.000Z	intelikey	Phuzion	no sources there.... hehhe     add a line like this "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper main restricted universe multiverse"
2006-06-01T10:09:00.000Z	intelikey	Phuzion	then update and dist-upgrade.....  but i'd wait the 6 or so hours till the release is out.
2006-06-01T10:10:00.000Z	intelikey	Phuzion	any change to /etc/apt/sources.list   MUST be followed by an apt-get update or equlevent
2006-06-01T10:15:00.000Z	intelikey	Phuzion	did you see my post ?
2006-06-01T10:15:00.000Z	Phuzion	intelikey	 I must have missed it
2006-06-01T10:15:00.000Z	intelikey	Phuzion	add a line like this "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper main restricted universe multiverse"
2006-06-01T10:15:00.000Z	intelikey	Phuzion	any change to /etc/apt/sources.list   MUST be followed by an apt-get update
2006-06-01T10:16:00.000Z	Phuzion	intelikey	 Added the line, apt-get update and still fails
2006-06-01T10:16:00.000Z	intelikey	Phuzion	did you what error message ?
2006-06-01T10:19:00.000Z	intelikey	Phuzion	drop the us.  maybe and try again
2006-06-01T10:19:00.000Z	intelikey	Phuzion	or add a nl.  or something
2006-06-01T10:20:00.000Z	intelikey	Phuzion	that is not a sources.list error.  that is a network error.
2006-06-01T10:24:00.000Z	intelikey	Phuzion	why do you have breezy cd in that list ?
