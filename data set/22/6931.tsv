2006-07-12T10:57:00.000Z	Frankenstein		hi, im having a few problems with ubuntu! i like it a lot BUT i cant gain root access, and i followed this link to learn how to: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-31053.html and also I cant get my wireless usb to work, i typed lspci but it didnt show that device
2006-07-12T10:58:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	lspci is not for usb devices. try lsusb instead.
2006-07-12T10:59:00.000Z	Frankenstein	POVaddct	i will try that thanks!
2006-07-12T11:05:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	sudo asks for your user password (the one you already used to log in)
2006-07-12T11:14:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	first you have to make sure, you card is supported at all. not every usb wireless card is.
2006-07-12T11:15:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	which vendor/product ID?
2006-07-12T11:16:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	there are two 4-digit numbers separated by a colon
2006-07-12T11:17:00.000Z	Frankenstein	POVaddct	where?
2006-07-12T11:17:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	in the lsusb output
2006-07-12T11:18:00.000Z	Frankenstein	POVaddct	sorry! ill be right back and write that down
2006-07-12T11:20:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	seems like it works with the at76c503 driver
2006-07-12T11:21:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	i don't know if this driver is in ubuntu linux (don't have a test system here right now)
2006-07-12T11:21:00.000Z	Frankenstein	POVaddct	awesome! is there a good tutorial on how to set this up so i can configure it?
2006-07-12T11:23:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	first try to find out if this driver is already on your system. if not, try to search in synaptic if it is installable from the repository. at a last resort, you can try compiling the driver from source (kinda hard for a newbie)
2006-07-12T11:24:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	the source is here: http://at76c503a.berlios.de/
2006-07-12T11:25:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	you need the sources of your running kernel to compile the driver (they are installable with synaptic or apt-get)
2006-07-12T11:33:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	i just saw the at76c503 driver already is in ubuntu
2006-07-12T11:34:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	does iwconfig report a wireless interface?
2006-07-12T11:34:00.000Z	Frankenstein	POVaddct	ill tell you in a seccond! two different pc's on two different floors!
2006-07-12T11:35:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	oh, okay
2006-07-12T11:37:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	lsusb just reports the connected usb devices. says nothing about supported devices.
2006-08-16T16:29:00.000Z	POVaddct	Frankenstein	it's a problem for you :))
