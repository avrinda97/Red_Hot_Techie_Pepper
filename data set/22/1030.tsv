2012-01-26T22:08:00.000Z	Pici	shaneo	Looks like you have a few issues there.  Firstly, you're missing the gpg keys for your ppas. You can use: sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com <key>    for getting them, where <key> is the last bit of the error message on lines 1-4.
2012-01-26T22:09:00.000Z	Pici	shaneo	Secondly, you may want to check that the PPAs urls are correct.
2012-01-26T22:16:00.000Z	shaneo	Pici	so i imported the gpg keys that were giving me errors and all is good
2012-01-26T22:17:00.000Z	Pici	shaneo	good good :)
2012-05-31T23:01:00.000Z	Pici	shaneo	servers have their own set of ssh keys that are separate from their user's keys.
2012-05-31T23:01:00.000Z	shaneo	Pici	oh that makes sense i was a little confused there for a sec
