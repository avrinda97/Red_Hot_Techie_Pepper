2006-11-15T13:46:00.000Z	dcordes		is there a maximum file size in ext3 ?
2006-11-15T13:47:00.000Z	mooey	dcordes	it depends on your block size, but at least 16gb
2006-11-15T13:49:00.000Z	dcordes	mooey	where is the difference betweeen ext2 and ext3?
2006-11-15T13:49:00.000Z	mooey	dcordes	ext3 has journaling.
2006-11-15T13:51:00.000Z	mooey	dcordes	neither of those sound deliberate :o
2006-11-15T13:52:00.000Z	dcordes	mooey	why. i know sh doesn't work anymore. and the driver didn't work. i tried 7 different versions of it(!!)
2006-11-15T13:54:00.000Z	mooey	dcordes	if dapper works for you then you should stay for sure
2006-11-16T08:24:00.000Z	mooey	dcordes	this isn't alot of use to you now, but its always wise to use 'rmdir' to remove a folder as it wont delete it if it isn't empty :(
2006-11-16T08:24:00.000Z	mooey	dcordes	if /media/Externe\ Festplatte was mounted then an rf -r would remove all the items inside that mount
2006-11-16T08:25:00.000Z	dcordes	mooey	i think i will allways to this from now.. but tell me is there any chance to get this back? and how could it happen? i pointed to a different folder
2006-11-16T08:25:00.000Z	dcordes	mooey	the folder was empty and there was nothing behind it. no mounting
2006-11-16T08:25:00.000Z	dcordes	mooey	but the point is that it removed files on /media/archiv1!!
2006-11-16T08:27:00.000Z	mooey	dcordes	perhaps its just unmounted, not wiped?
2006-11-16T08:27:00.000Z	dcordes	mooey	it is still mounted
2006-11-16T08:27:00.000Z	dcordes	mooey	and there are 400 albums left of 600
2006-11-16T08:27:00.000Z	dcordes	mooey	very strange isn't it?!
2006-11-16T08:27:00.000Z	mooey	dcordes	perhaps they are unrelated. i dont know how stable ntfs support under linux is. maybe its corruption?
2006-11-16T08:30:00.000Z	mooey	dcordes	i feel your pain :( i've toasted gigs of music before its not fun
2006-11-16T08:30:00.000Z	dcordes	mooey	i remounted but the files won't appear again
2006-11-16T08:32:00.000Z	mooey	dcordes	good luck :x
2006-11-16T08:32:00.000Z	dcordes	mooey	you know a file undeleter for xp?
2006-11-16T08:32:00.000Z	mooey	dcordes	i dont i'm afraid. i've never used windows ;o
