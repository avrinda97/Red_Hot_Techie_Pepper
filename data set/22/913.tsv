2011-01-18T20:11:00.000Z	Julia_23		Anyone around to give me some advice?
2011-01-18T20:11:00.000Z	Julia_23		Okay
2011-01-18T20:13:00.000Z	Julia_23		 I have a system reserved  emtpy SDA1 primary NTFS 100 mb.   SDA2 is 100 gig ntfs emtpy. 3rd partition is extended 50 gig  for linux, finally 2gig swap.  I want to replace the 100 GIG ntfs with ext4 and use that partition as my home folder.... if I replace the system reserved or the SDA2 ntfs partition
2011-01-18T20:13:00.000Z	Julia_23		Sorry, system reserved isnt empty... my bad
2011-01-18T20:14:00.000Z	Julia_23		If i format or delete sda1/2 will I lose my grub?
2011-01-18T20:14:00.000Z	Julia_23		see, I want to copy some of my old ubuntu files to a new 100 gig ext4
2011-01-18T20:15:00.000Z	Julia_23		So I want to keep my logical 50 gig linux in tact for the time being, because I dont have any drives to back up my information
2011-01-18T20:15:00.000Z	Julia_23		skorv
2011-01-18T20:16:00.000Z	rubbs	Julia_23	so just make sure I have this right. You have a 100Gb ntfs drive you want to delete and make an EXT4 drive correct?
2011-01-18T20:16:00.000Z	rubbs	Julia_23	You are willing to lose everything on your NTFS drive?
2011-01-18T20:17:00.000Z	rubbs	Julia_23	ah, so you want to re-install windows.
2011-01-18T20:18:00.000Z	rubbs	Julia_23	I'd suggest using a partion editor to carve out the partitions you want. Then install windows on the ntfs drive. Then if grub gets messed up you can use the livecd to repair grub.
2011-01-18T20:18:00.000Z	rubbs	Julia_23	I'll see if I can dig up a link on how to repair grub... just a sec.
2011-01-18T20:19:00.000Z	rubbs	Julia_23	not really. Linux second is easier because it's auto-magical. but it's possible to do windows after a linux install.
2011-01-18T20:20:00.000Z	rubbs	Julia_23	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot#Installing Windows After Ubuntu This gives you some ideas you may have to worry about installing windows after Ubuntu.
2011-01-18T20:21:00.000Z	rubbs	Julia_23	np. if you have more specific questions about any of it. let the room know. someone should be able to help.
2011-01-18T20:22:00.000Z	rubbs	Julia_23	np.
2011-01-18T20:45:00.000Z	Julia_23	rubbs	If your home partition is separate from your system partition, is there any point in encrypting your HOME parition, will this make it not worth the hassle of reinstalling your UBuntu os?
2011-01-18T20:47:00.000Z	rubbs	Julia_23	I've done both. Encryption can make it harder to do a recovery if you ever have to re-install... on the other hand, that's kind of the point ;).
2011-01-18T20:49:00.000Z	rubbs	Julia_23	I don't encrypt my desktop, but I do on my laptop. It's really a matter of how much you want privacy vs. ease of use later on.
2011-01-18T20:49:00.000Z	Julia_23	rubbs	indeed
