2010-05-15T08:57:00.000Z	kerozene		does anyone here run ubuntu on a server?
2010-05-15T08:58:00.000Z	kerozene		straw poll: what repos do you enable?
2010-05-15T09:00:00.000Z	kerozene		server admins: what extra repos are safe to enable?
2010-05-15T09:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kerozene	 when in doubt - only enable the repos for programs you need.
2010-05-15T09:03:00.000Z	kerozene	Dr_Willis	the issue is about package freshness
2010-05-15T09:04:00.000Z	kerozene	Dr_Willis	you want me to define 'freshness' in this context?
2010-05-15T09:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kerozene	 clarifing the problem is proberly a good idea.
2010-05-15T09:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kerozene	 you mean more 'up to date version' then.  and i agree with theadmin
2010-05-15T09:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kerozene	 even then  they wont be as uptodate as you may want.
2010-05-15T09:20:00.000Z	kerozene	Dr_Willis	sure, so then it's time to get the src. I'm not looking for a binary answer here...just opinions
2010-05-15T09:20:00.000Z	kerozene	Dr_Willis	really? that's interesting
2010-05-15T09:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kerozene	 thats how the packaging/repos/versions/release cycle works in ubuntu
2010-05-15T09:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kerozene	 ubuntu updated every 6 mo to the next release. in theory there should be very few updates btween releases. (just for security issues, not just version changes)
2010-05-15T09:21:00.000Z	kerozene	Dr_Willis	I'm on lts (hardy)
2010-05-15T09:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kerozene	 then if you want updated packages yOu may want to go to the next LTS then
2010-05-15T09:23:00.000Z	kerozene	Dr_Willis	next lts available to me is lucid :/
2010-05-15T09:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kerozene	 and your point is?
2010-05-15T09:31:00.000Z	kerozene	Dr_Willis	yeah, I use that for IE6 testing
2010-05-15T09:40:00.000Z	kerozene	Dr_Willis	you mentioned backports - it's not enabled by default but it would seem like a good idea for any server. agree?
2010-05-15T09:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kerozene	 totally depends on your needs. THere might not be many 'server' things backported..  I rarely do 'servers'
2010-05-15T09:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kerozene	 if you are wanting updated packages. You may as well use the next LTS release. backported stuff is techically not supported by ubuntu (i think)
2010-05-15T09:42:00.000Z	kerozene	Dr_Willis	interesting point, thx
