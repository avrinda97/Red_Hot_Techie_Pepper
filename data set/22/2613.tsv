2010-02-22T15:22:00.000Z	indus	perfection	grub installs to mbr of device not partition

2010-02-22T15:23:00.000Z	perfection	indus	okay, i got u
2010-02-22T15:23:00.000Z	indus	perfection	you can also do sudo grub-install /dev/sda2 etc but i never did it
2010-02-22T15:31:00.000Z	perfection	indus	does ubuntu support hyperthreading technology as the one in the intel i5 cpu?
2010-02-22T15:32:00.000Z	indus	perfection	hmm what is that in i 5
2010-02-22T15:33:00.000Z	perfection	indus	i mean the new intel cpus, they say they have hyperthreading features, etc. and i want to buy a laptop with one, so i was wondering if i cud take adventage of that technology with ubuntu
2010-02-22T15:34:00.000Z	indus	perfection	i hear its being worked on, not sure if it even works properly with windows 7 yet
2010-02-22T15:35:00.000Z	perfection	indus	oh, maybe i shud wait and hope the next kernel release supports that
2010-02-22T15:35:00.000Z	indus	perfection	let me google it, but hyperthreading is supported for some time in linux, but the new i 5 etc have some new tricks so
2010-02-22T15:37:00.000Z	perfection	indus	okay thanx
2010-02-22T15:41:00.000Z	indus	perfection	i think it works fine with newest kernel
2010-02-22T15:41:00.000Z	indus	perfection	wait ill give you a nice link
2010-02-22T15:41:00.000Z	indus	perfection	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/429036
2010-02-22T15:43:00.000Z	perfection	indus	that's good news though i heard in lucid they may not use the latest kernel, i think we'll have to upgrade
2010-02-22T15:43:00.000Z	indus	perfection	i think its fixed already
2010-02-22T15:43:00.000Z	indus	perfection	does it say only for lucid?
2010-02-22T15:44:00.000Z	indus	perfection	i think it will make its way into karmic probably
2010-02-22T15:44:00.000Z	perfection	indus	am sure it will but i prefer the latest so i'll upgrade to lucid
2010-02-22T15:45:00.000Z	perfection	indus	and i read on some blog they were saying lucid may not use the latest kernel, maybe they'll backport some module or whatever
2010-02-22T15:46:00.000Z	perfection	indus	about processors that support 64bit, when you use 32bit version of OS are you under-utilizing the processor?
