2010-09-02T20:53:00.000Z	st__		any one to help with boot problem..... it's frustrating and i need macjhine to work
2010-09-02T20:54:00.000Z	sipior	st__	what sort of boot problem, exactly?
2010-09-02T20:55:00.000Z	sipior	st__	fails how?
2010-09-02T20:56:00.000Z	sipior	st__	could you pastebin whatever errors it does show?
2010-09-02T20:58:00.000Z	sipior	st__	can you pastebin the console output immediately before the time out?
2010-09-02T21:01:00.000Z	st__	sipior	no, it's a real machine; and I just understood what strange, there was no my hd chart in output like "hda1 < hda5 hda6>"
2010-09-02T21:01:00.000Z	sipior	st__	well, that would certainly do it.
2010-09-02T21:04:00.000Z	sipior	st__	if the system can't find the volume on which the root filesystem should be found, it won't boot. check that the disk connections are correct. can you try booting off a live cd or the like?
2010-09-02T21:06:00.000Z	st__	sipior	no, the kernel was loaded from that partition, why wouldn't it able to find it?? I gave root=/dev/sda8 option
2010-09-02T21:07:00.000Z	sipior	st__	/dev/sda8 is your /boot + /root partition?
2010-09-02T21:07:00.000Z	st__	sipior	yes
2010-09-02T21:08:00.000Z	sipior	st__	i'd really need to see some console output before speculating further
2010-09-22T16:53:00.000Z	sipior	st__	generally /lib/modules/<kernel id>
2010-09-22T18:00:00.000Z	sipior	st__	"man xsetroot" shows all sorts of options for you to play with
2010-09-22T18:00:00.000Z	st__	sipior	except the color format
2010-09-22T18:02:00.000Z	sipior	st__	it won't accept hex code colours, if that's what you mean :-) have you tried just giving it the name of a colour?
2010-09-22T18:08:00.000Z	sipior	st__	yes, it's a comment.
2010-09-22T18:09:00.000Z	sipior	st__	same parser running...
2010-09-23T17:33:00.000Z	sipior	st__	?
2010-09-23T17:33:00.000Z	sipior	st__	that's not right. it's not even wrong.
2010-09-23T17:33:00.000Z	st__	sipior	unless you want to propose some geek crap like screen or twm
2010-09-23T17:35:00.000Z	sipior	st__	well, there are some folks who swear by kde, xfce, &cet. you might try looking around, once in a while.
