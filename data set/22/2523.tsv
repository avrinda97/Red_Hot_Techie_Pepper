2009-08-01T10:31:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	How are you attempting to wake it up
2009-08-01T10:31:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	Does the PC start to respond at all?
2009-08-01T10:31:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	Not sure but have you tried the power button instead?
2009-08-01T10:32:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	Yeah i figured. umm
2009-08-01T10:32:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	9.04?
2009-08-01T10:32:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	All current updates?
2009-08-01T10:33:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	Has it ever worked on that machine before with 9.04 installed?
2009-08-01T10:34:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	Hard to say, might be incompatible hardware. 8.04 LTS has had many updates might work better if you really need those features.
2009-08-01T10:36:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	Right click doesnt work for what exactly?
2009-08-01T10:37:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	 What are you trying to use the right mouse button for in ff ?
2009-08-01T10:43:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	is it a deb or .run or what?
2009-08-01T10:44:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	Double click it and itll open gdebi installer.
2009-08-01T11:07:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	sure is
2009-08-01T11:08:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	if you want to use a DVD you can even use up all that extra space by using something like UCK ubuntu customization kit and have all your fav apps installed out of the box. kinda cool to do.
2009-08-01T11:09:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	add/remove or synaptic its in the repos
2009-08-01T11:10:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	sy1	yep uck in synaptic
