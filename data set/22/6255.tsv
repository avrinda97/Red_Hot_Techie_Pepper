2007-04-06T06:57:00.000Z	firefoxman		Hello?
2007-04-06T06:57:00.000Z	firefoxman		I am having trouble using Qemu to boot off an WinXP Home CD, it says
2007-04-06T06:57:00.000Z	firefoxman		qemu: could not open hard disk image '/dev/cdrom'
2007-04-06T06:57:00.000Z	firefoxman		And then quits
2007-04-06T06:57:00.000Z	firefoxman		Ok.
2007-04-06T06:57:00.000Z	firefoxman		Sorry.
2007-04-06T06:58:00.000Z	firefoxman		Ok.
2007-04-06T06:59:00.000Z	firefoxman		!keyboard
2007-04-06T07:00:00.000Z	sipior	firefoxman	are you sure the disk is at /dev/cdrom?
2007-04-06T07:00:00.000Z	firefoxman	sipior	I think it is at /media/cdrom0, but that dosnt work either.
2007-04-06T07:01:00.000Z	sipior	firefoxman	verify by "cat /etc/mtab" and see if the path's right
2007-04-06T07:01:00.000Z	firefoxman	sipior	Should I unmount it first? It automounted.
2007-04-06T07:01:00.000Z	sipior	firefoxman	you could try that as well
2007-04-06T07:01:00.000Z	firefoxman	sipior	How would I go about doing that?
2007-04-06T07:02:00.000Z	sipior	firefoxman	type "cat /etc/mtab", see where the disk is mounted, then type "sudo umount <path>"
2007-04-06T07:02:00.000Z	firefoxman	sipior	Wow. Actualy, I got it working by using /dev/hdc. Isnt that supposed to be my hard drive?
2007-04-06T07:03:00.000Z	sipior	firefoxman	no, every device plugged into the ide controller get a label, cd/dvd drives included
2007-04-06T07:09:00.000Z	sipior	firefoxman	you can add to the nameserver list on the network config panel. or just modify /etc/resolv.conf
2007-04-06T07:09:00.000Z	sipior	firefoxman	but then you have to tell dhcp not to overwrite that file
2007-04-06T07:10:00.000Z	sipior	firefoxman	they'll be checked in order, so just arrange them that way
