2006-11-27T09:21:00.000Z	caffiendo		I have a Linksys WUSB54Gv2 (WIFI) and instructions for install on Dapper 6.06.  Should they be the same for Edgy?
2006-11-27T09:21:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	yep, should be.
2006-11-27T09:24:00.000Z	caffiendo	dragonfyre13	thank you.  new to IRC too.
2006-11-27T09:24:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	no problem.
2006-11-27T09:25:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	check out this page. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/Belkin_F5D7050_ver_3000_%28Ralink_rt73_driver%29?highlight=%28rt73%29
2006-11-27T09:26:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	that's what I just setup.
2006-11-27T09:26:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	email me at dragonfyre13@gmail.com with questions if you need help beyond that.
2006-11-27T09:26:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	if I'm not on later.
2006-11-27T09:27:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	that shows you how to setup that card. That's the chipset for rt73.
2006-11-27T09:27:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	quite likely, that's what your using.
2006-11-27T09:27:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	does it show wlan and wmaster?
2006-11-27T09:28:00.000Z	caffiendo	dragonfyre13	much appreciated!
2006-11-27T09:28:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	for your network interfaces?
2006-11-27T09:28:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	do a ifconfig to find out.
2006-11-27T09:29:00.000Z	caffiendo	dragonfyre13	i've only checked in device manager and it shws.  I just started the install and wanted 2 c if there was anything special  I'll check config now.
2006-11-27T09:30:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	I got to go now, but email me at the address I gave you if you have some questions. Plenty of caveats if you don't know what you are doing with an rt73 chipset on linux.
2006-11-27T09:31:00.000Z	caffiendo	dragonfyre13	thanks. i'll give it a try and see whathappens.  thanks for the support!
2006-11-27T09:31:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	no problem. I like to help out where I can, and I'll write a howto soon on the boards.
2006-11-27T09:32:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	be sure to email me if you have questions. very few people have the information to get it up and running correctly.
2006-11-27T09:32:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	I still don't have wep working, but that should be fairly painless. The hard part (driver installation) is behind me.
2006-11-27T09:33:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	caffiendo	also note, you can't use network manager to manage the connection. Connection manager (grab it from the forums) works with the rt73 chipset though.
2006-11-27T09:33:00.000Z	caffiendo	dragonfyre13	peace
