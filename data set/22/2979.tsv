2009-03-07T09:25:00.000Z	RPS		Hello Guys, I had a tough time with my new (piece of crap) Vista machine when I tried to run 8.10 64bit on it from the wubi folder. Now it actually ran perfectly, so I said that wrong. I'll explain, it was a sweet set up and everything ran to perfection UNTIL I tried to run anything with from CD/DVD drive ...it would show everything on any media placed in the drive, but as soon as I tried to use anything in the drive it would immediately

Well anyway I made a post on the forums and followed it for over a month. I wound up buying another laptop and I just spotted a reply on my old post. It seems to answer my issue, but it confuses me a little at the same time. If someone could take a look at it I'd be thankful.

2009-03-07T09:30:00.000Z	ziroday	RPS	one sec
2009-03-07T09:32:00.000Z	ziroday	RPS	it does sound like a serious issue you have got there :)
2009-03-07T09:32:00.000Z	ziroday	RPS	so just trying to understand, you are still using wubi right?
2009-03-07T09:33:00.000Z	ziroday	RPS	and basically as soon as you play any media of a cd/dvd the drive dies?
2009-03-07T09:33:00.000Z	ziroday	RPS	right, do you know if it happens on a livecd/actual install?
2009-03-07T09:34:00.000Z	ziroday	RPS	please address it makes it easier for me :). Does this happen on an actual install or just wubi?
2009-03-07T09:35:00.000Z	ziroday	RPS	hmm right. Well I would strongly recommend you try to install ubuntu normally on your computer and see if its still an issue
2009-03-07T09:36:00.000Z	ziroday	RPS	not that I have heard of.
2009-03-07T09:36:00.000Z	ziroday	RPS	nope, just follow the installer and you should be as good as gold
2009-03-07T09:45:00.000Z	RPS	ziroday	do you think I should give it another try? Should I change my bios settings like the guy said in the post? Do you think it will give me issues like the guy said?
2009-03-07T09:46:00.000Z	ziroday	RPS	yep I reckon you should, I would change the bios settings, and I would do a proper ubuntu install, not with wubi
2009-03-07T09:48:00.000Z	RPS	ziroday	now I have to think in a WinBlows way ...let me see, Vista wants permission to do this and that and that and ...
2009-03-07T10:59:00.000Z	RPS	ziroday	are you still hanging out there?
2009-03-07T11:00:00.000Z	ziroday	RPS	barely
2009-03-07T11:02:00.000Z	RPS	ziroday	I tried changing the setting and it locked up my pc, so I called an Asus tech and he told me the info the guy left me was spot-on, but that I would have to do a reinstall to use it, so now its back up time and then I'll pull the trigger on it.
2009-03-07T11:02:00.000Z	ziroday	RPS	awesome
2009-03-07T11:03:00.000Z	RPS	ziroday	I just retoggled my bios settings back and everything is fine
2009-03-07T11:03:00.000Z	ziroday	RPS	so it all works?
2009-03-07T11:04:00.000Z	ziroday	RPS	it sounds like you have a buggy/crappy/incompatible sata controller
