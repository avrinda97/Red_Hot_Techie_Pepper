2012-01-28T05:03:00.000Z	Phong_		something to do with 22??
2012-01-28T05:04:00.000Z	Phong_		local ip
2012-01-28T05:05:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	sounds like your sshd isn't listening on localhost.
2012-01-28T05:05:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	check /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2012-01-28T05:05:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	or connect to the "real" IP.
2012-01-28T05:09:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	is sshd actually running?
2012-01-28T05:15:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	how about you just try and find out?
2012-01-28T05:18:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	what happened when you did the start command?
2012-01-28T05:20:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	yes?
2012-01-28T05:20:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	I asked what happened.
2012-01-28T05:20:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	i.e. the result of that command.
2012-01-28T05:22:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	uh, no.
2012-01-28T05:23:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	that's not the output of the restart command.
2012-01-28T05:26:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	that depends on the output of that command.. :-)
2012-01-28T05:28:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	if you're not able to tell me what happens when you're asked to run a command, things kindof stop.
2012-01-28T05:31:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	how useful do you think it is to show us the same command we asked you to run?
2012-01-28T05:32:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	does anything appear on your screen below that line?
2012-01-28T05:32:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	I assume you did press enter?
2012-01-28T05:33:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	before the new command prompt.
2012-01-28T05:36:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	you have pasted the command you typed.
2012-01-28T05:36:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	I don't care about the command. I care about the result.
2012-01-28T05:37:00.000Z	_NiC	Phong_	ask a friend to help you. I don't think we'll get anywhere.
