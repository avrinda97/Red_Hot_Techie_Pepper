2008-03-23T19:52:00.000Z	cha0s		hi, i have a question about the 'date' command. why is it rejecting 'CST' as my timezone?
2008-03-23T19:54:00.000Z	cha0s		lol, I set CEST and it changed to CDT
2008-03-23T19:54:00.000Z	cha0s		:~/dev/fb/freebasic$ sudo date --set='Sun Mar 23 10:49:22 CEST 2008'
2008-03-23T19:55:00.000Z	cha0s		Sun Mar 23 03:49:22 CDT 2008
2008-03-23T19:55:00.000Z	cha0s		=(
2008-03-23T19:56:00.000Z	cha0s		sudo set passwd root?
2008-03-23T19:56:00.000Z	cha0s		su does too work, at least on xubuntu
2008-03-23T19:57:00.000Z	cha0s		su - root
2008-03-23T19:57:00.000Z	ikonia	cha0s	no, please don't advise that, plus it's wrong
2008-03-23T19:58:00.000Z	ikonia	cha0s	thats not a command
2008-03-23T19:58:00.000Z	ikonia	cha0s	please stop saying things you don't know / understand
2008-03-23T19:59:00.000Z	cha0s	ikonia	thanks, i was making a Suggestion. You are free to mellow out now. Thanks in advance.
2008-03-23T19:59:00.000Z	ikonia	cha0s	your not making suggestions your talking nonsense
2008-03-23T20:00:00.000Z	ikonia	cha0s	I'm not making a personal attack, please stop saying commands that are invalid or wrong or dangerous
2008-03-23T20:00:00.000Z	ikonia	cha0s	so - don't say it
2008-03-23T20:00:00.000Z	cha0s	ikonia	Settle down dude seriously, loosen the collar or something.
2008-03-23T20:01:00.000Z	ikonia	cha0s	I'm settled - just don't give out nonsense/dangerous advice
2008-03-23T20:02:00.000Z	ikonia	cha0s	use ntpdate
2008-03-23T20:12:00.000Z	cha0s	ikonia	I solved my date problem by typing 'su -root', entering the root password, and changing the date. Thanks.
2008-03-23T20:13:00.000Z	ikonia	cha0s	su - is the correct way to su, but sudo date would also have worked
2008-03-23T20:13:00.000Z	ikonia	cha0s	using ntpdate or ntpd will keep your time in sync and stop it drifting again
2008-03-23T20:13:00.000Z	ikonia	cha0s	ahhhh I see
