2008-07-12T21:53:00.000Z	gaelfx		can anyone tell me how to install the gutsy kernel in hardy?
2008-07-12T21:55:00.000Z	gaelfx		or is that not possible?
2008-07-12T21:56:00.000Z	wols_	gaelfx	^^
2008-08-10T11:59:00.000Z	wols_	gaelfx	you read rubbish
2008-08-10T11:59:00.000Z	gaelfx	wols_	excuse me?
2008-08-10T11:59:00.000Z	wols_	gaelfx	wrong tab complete
2008-08-10T12:01:00.000Z	wols_	gaelfx	no. use forcedeth
2008-08-10T12:01:00.000Z	gaelfx	wols_	ok, how do I do that?
2008-08-10T12:02:00.000Z	wols_	gaelfx	it's the normal nvidia ethernet driver
2008-08-10T12:02:00.000Z	gaelfx	wols_	look, whatever came with Ubuntu DOESN'T WORK, so the "normal" driver isn't acceptable in this case
2008-08-10T12:13:00.000Z	wols_	gaelfx	lspci -nn
2008-08-10T12:24:00.000Z	wols_	gaelfx	what is your connection to the net? your isp connection that is
2008-08-10T12:24:00.000Z	gaelfx	wols_	PPPoE dialed through a static ip
2008-08-10T12:25:00.000Z	wols_	gaelfx	btw: internet network speed has nothing to do with LAN speed unless you have a 100MBit connection to the internet at least
2008-08-10T12:25:00.000Z	wols_	gaelfx	I meant the speed your ISP gives you. e.g. I have a 6Mbit connection down and 550kbit upstream
2008-08-10T12:25:00.000Z	gaelfx	wols_	ok
2008-08-10T12:25:00.000Z	wols_	gaelfx	so what speed does your ISP give you?
2008-08-10T12:26:00.000Z	gaelfx	wols_	I don't know, I connect through my school, I live in China
2008-08-10T12:26:00.000Z	gaelfx	wols_	that's why I need a static IP, I think it's for the switch they have me hooked into
2008-08-10T12:26:00.000Z	gaelfx	wols_	the only thing they tell me is "FAST" or "SLOW"
2008-08-10T12:30:00.000Z	gaelfx	wols_	so thus ends the conversation?
2008-08-10T12:33:00.000Z	wols_	gaelfx	forcedeth is the ONLY driver you can use for your wired ethernet and it is so much faster than the average internet connection it can't be a problem. look into the great firewall which might prefer windows network stacks or similar ISP side issues
