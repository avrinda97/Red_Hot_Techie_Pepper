2011-03-19T04:20:00.000Z	Guest4965		I really need to install iwl4965
2011-03-19T04:20:00.000Z	twitch	Guest4965	explain?
2011-03-19T04:21:00.000Z	Guest4965	twitch	On ubuntu 10.04 iwl4965 was the default kernel module for my device. It worked fine. Now in 10.10, it is iwlagn, iwlagn crashes my kernel at boot.
2011-03-19T04:22:00.000Z	twitch	Guest4965	when it's loading modules before it gets to gdm?
2011-03-19T04:22:00.000Z	Guest4965	twitch	yes
2011-03-19T04:23:00.000Z	twitch	Guest4965	nasty .. whats the last line you see before it crashes
2011-03-19T04:24:00.000Z	twitch	Guest4965	uname -m
2011-03-19T04:24:00.000Z	Guest4965	twitch	I don't know the last line, it says something about adding station ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

2011-03-19T04:25:00.000Z	twitch	Guest4965	and this is a stock kernel ?
2011-03-19T04:25:00.000Z	Guest4965	twitch	I blacklisted iwlagn, that gets me to GDM.
2011-03-19T04:25:00.000Z	Guest4965	twitch	Yeah, stock.
2011-03-19T04:28:00.000Z	twitch	Guest4965	im not smart lol :P .. i'm of meh head atm :P
2011-03-19T04:30:00.000Z	twitch	Guest4965	as for your wifi ... im still thinking away :P have u tried downloading and patching with the compat-wireless driver code
2011-03-19T04:30:00.000Z	Guest4965	twitch	Yeah
2011-03-19T04:31:00.000Z	Guest4965	twitch	Somehow compat-wireless doesn't have iwl4965 anymore. How do I try using backports?
2011-03-19T04:31:00.000Z	twitch	Guest4965	did you use bleeding edge release or a older more stable release of compat
2011-03-19T04:32:00.000Z	Guest4965	twitch	I don't think they were bleeding edge, either way, there is no iwl4965 module
2011-03-19T04:33:00.000Z	Guest4965	twitch	Here's something strange, ifconfig -a shows wlan0
2011-03-19T04:35:00.000Z	twitch	Guest4965	your on a laptop right?
2011-03-19T04:36:00.000Z	twitch	Guest4965	fn+f5 ?
2011-03-19T04:40:00.000Z	twitch	Guest4965	i have no ideas sry unless you backport a kernel
