2008-03-12T09:47:00.000Z	Flannel	xb3rt	BIOS usually
2008-03-12T09:48:00.000Z	xb3rt	Flannel	do you know how to modify a windows exit animation in ubuntu
2008-03-12T09:49:00.000Z	Flannel	xb3rt	Windows exit animation?  The bitmap thing?  That, and the bootup one, are just images stored places.  But no, I don't know the specifics.
2008-03-12T09:49:00.000Z	xb3rt	Flannel	like when i exit a window in linux it fads out as its going away
2008-03-12T09:49:00.000Z	Flannel	xb3rt	Oh.  No, I have no idea.
2008-03-12T10:07:00.000Z	Flannel	xb3rt	Google is probably your best bet.
2008-03-12T10:13:00.000Z	Flannel	xb3rt	BitchX or bitchx will start it.
2008-03-12T10:14:00.000Z	xb3rt	Flannel	ok, ty
2008-03-12T10:17:00.000Z	xb3rt	Flannel	bitchx is terminal based?
2008-03-12T10:19:00.000Z	Flannel	xb3rt	it is.
2008-03-12T10:27:00.000Z	Flannel	xb3rt	wine.  It works really well: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WorldofWarcraft
2008-03-12T10:27:00.000Z	xb3rt	Flannel	the crappy thing is i bought it from a direct download
2008-03-12T10:28:00.000Z	Flannel	xb3rt	I have no idea what that means.  Wine is still the best method though.  You might be able to get additional wine support (to resolve whatever direct download issues you have) in #winehq
2008-03-12T10:29:00.000Z	xb3rt	Flannel	it just means that i dont actually have the game, I paid to download the install file, but that should still work in wine
2008-03-12T10:29:00.000Z	Flannel	xb3rt	that's correct.
2008-03-12T10:31:00.000Z	xb3rt	Flannel	i just changed my user login name, and now my sudo password doesnt work.....how do i go about fixing that
2008-03-12T10:32:00.000Z	Flannel	xb3rt	type 'groups' are you in the admin group?
2008-03-12T10:33:00.000Z	Flannel	xb3rt	and how did you change your login?
2008-03-29T05:08:00.000Z	Flannel	xb3rt	because it's only around for that bash session.  Try adding it to .bashrc
2008-03-29T05:08:00.000Z	xb3rt	Flannel	Where would i find .bashrc
2008-03-29T05:08:00.000Z	Flannel	xb3rt	~/.bashrc
