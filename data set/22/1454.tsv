2010-05-09T03:59:00.000Z	starspot		I  have 88 GiB "unallocated" space on my hard drive (former windows). How do I use Gparted to extent my Ubuntu partition into that unallocated space? I'm using the boot cd
2010-05-09T04:01:00.000Z	Appl6	starspot	Use System->Administration->GParted.  Then Resize the partition you want to expand so it uses up that unallocated space.
2010-05-09T04:03:00.000Z	starspot	Appl6	Jordan_U I tried both ways - I'm in gparted now. My dev/sda has only an extended partition, which contains the ext4 that I want larger. I try to resize the extended partition but gparted doesn't offer that option
2010-05-09T04:04:00.000Z	Appl6	starspot	It won't let you resize the expanded partition if any of logical partitions inside of it are mounted.  You have to unmount them first (right click and choose unmount).
2010-05-09T04:04:00.000Z	starspot	Appl6	ah-HA!....
2010-05-09T04:06:00.000Z	starspot	Appl6	it seems to be the linux-swap that's active but it doesn't offer option to "unmount" - only "swapoff" Is swapoff the same thing?
2010-05-09T04:07:00.000Z	Appl6	starspot	It's not "the same thing", but it tells your computer to stop using that partition.  So in this case it does what you want it to do.
2010-05-09T04:08:00.000Z	starspot	Appl6	heheh right. oops ha ha. yeah it's working now with swap turned off. Now I'm dragging the black arrow of the extended partition all the way to the 0 mark
2010-05-09T04:09:00.000Z	starspot	Appl6	how will grub handle this now?
2010-05-09T04:10:00.000Z	Appl6	starspot	Grub needs a primary partition to boot from.  If you have one (besides the extended partition), then you should be fine.
2010-05-09T04:11:00.000Z	starspot	Appl6	ouch - I don't
2010-05-09T04:12:00.000Z	Appl6	starspot	You have Ubuntu installed on a logical partition?
2010-05-09T04:12:00.000Z	Appl6	starspot	How have you been booting into it so far?
2010-05-09T04:13:00.000Z	starspot	Appl6	this was a dual-boot windows/ubuntu and before ubuntu it also had an HP_Recovery partition. When I installed ubuntu the installer created an extended partition and put the ext3 and linux-swap in there
2010-05-09T04:13:00.000Z	starspot	Appl6	so where would grub reside in that scenario?
2010-05-09T04:14:00.000Z	starspot	Appl6	I just deleted the only 2 primary partitions with gparted (one NTFS and one FAT)
2010-05-09T04:14:00.000Z	Appl6	starspot	Let me confirm this: you have Ubuntu installed on a logical partition, and you could boot from it using the Grub prompt at boot?
2010-05-09T04:16:00.000Z	starspot	Appl6	on an extended partition (is that a logical partition, or are those inside the extended partition?), but yes, I've been booting with grub
2010-05-09T04:18:00.000Z	Appl6	starspot	Logical partitions are all the partitions inside an extended partition.  And for some reason I was under the (apparently incorrect) assumption that Grub needed to boot a primary partition.  But if you can boot from it then there's nothing wrong, so go ahead and resize.
2010-05-09T04:19:00.000Z	starspot	Appl6	coolio. I'll restart and see. I can always come back with the boot cd - thanks!
2010-05-09T04:20:00.000Z	Appl6	starspot	Sure, good luck!
2010-05-09T04:22:00.000Z	starspot	Appl6	thanks! I'll know if it works in around 30 minutes - right now gparted is humming away at resizing
