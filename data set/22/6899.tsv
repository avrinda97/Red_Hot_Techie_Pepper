2006-06-28T10:52:00.000Z	snoops		I'm keen to do a bit of a slideshow + desktop presentation of my linux user experience with a voice recording added in.. preferably at the same time in one nice app..
2006-06-28T10:52:00.000Z	snoops		are there any apps built for the job?
2006-06-28T10:53:00.000Z	snoops		sudo ehtotam
2006-06-28T10:53:00.000Z	snoops		sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst for example ehtotam
2006-06-28T10:53:00.000Z	snoops		super user do..
2006-06-28T10:53:00.000Z	snoops		no worries
2006-06-28T10:55:00.000Z	snoops		hope you made a backup just in case ehtotam ;)
2006-06-28T10:57:00.000Z	snoops		wireless Orgullomoore?
2006-06-28T10:58:00.000Z	Orgullomoore	snoops	no, I'm connected through a cable to my router, which is connected to a cable connection
2006-06-28T10:59:00.000Z	Orgullomoore	snoops	and when I'm disconnected, it instantly reconnects..but I would still lose an IRC connection, for example. And my router continues to show connectivity
2006-06-28T10:59:00.000Z	snoops	Orgullomoore	have another computer on the network to test with.. (trying to rule out the possibility of the router packing a sad)
2006-06-28T11:00:00.000Z	Orgullomoore	snoops	<nod>, I've tried it on this same computer on Knoppix--works fine. Tried it on another computer under Windows, also works fine.
2006-06-28T11:02:00.000Z	Orgullomoore	snoops	haha, I've tried that too...I'm actually connected through two ethernet cards...different brands and all
2006-06-28T11:04:00.000Z	snoops	Orgullomoore	oh hmm.. is the network connections (both) bridged with the router?
2006-06-28T11:05:00.000Z	Orgullomoore	snoops	I'm no networking expert...but when 1 is active, the other is not...I don't know how to make them both work at the same time. When I disconnect one, the other one takes over
2006-06-28T11:07:00.000Z	Orgullomoore	snoops	no, I don't need two. I just connected the second one after having so many problems with the first and figured it might help. But it doesn't.
2006-06-28T11:07:00.000Z	Orgullomoore	snoops	sure
2006-06-28T11:09:00.000Z	Orgullomoore	snoops	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16676
2006-06-28T11:11:00.000Z	Orgullomoore	snoops	excuse me?
2006-06-28T11:12:00.000Z	snoops	Orgullomoore	'ta a way of saying thanks'.. anyway, those errors aren't nice at all.. could be packet collisons or something
2006-06-28T11:13:00.000Z	snoops	Orgullomoore	want to try with just one card (just the new one)
2006-06-28T11:13:00.000Z	Orgullomoore	snoops	sounds like a good idea, I'll disconnect the first and we'll see how it goes
