2006-01-07T15:13:00.000Z	topyli	KarlosII	your question seems to be far up, not everybody will remember it now. ask away
2006-01-07T15:14:00.000Z	KarlosII	topyli	ehehe I've already repeated it twice :)
2006-01-07T15:14:00.000Z	topyli	KarlosII	yeah, smb://host/share or something
2006-01-07T15:15:00.000Z	KarlosII	topyli	umm why won't it show me a list of host on the network?
2006-01-07T15:16:00.000Z	topyli	KarlosII	dunno, when i go to places -> network servers, i get all servers on the network visible. (which sucks on a large university network btw)
2006-01-07T15:18:00.000Z	KarlosII	topyli	the fiel manager is not showing a option for places -> network servers
2006-01-07T15:19:00.000Z	topyli	KarlosII	are you using gnome or kde? the places menu on the gnome panel is what i mean
2006-01-07T15:20:00.000Z	KarlosII	topyli	it's asking for a password
2006-01-07T15:20:00.000Z	topyli	KarlosII	good :)
2006-01-07T15:21:00.000Z	topyli	KarlosII	whatever password you have on the server you're connecting to
2006-01-07T15:22:00.000Z	KarlosII	topyli	ummm server?
2006-01-07T15:22:00.000Z	topyli	KarlosII	to your machine, the other box (with the share) is the server
2006-01-07T15:22:00.000Z	KarlosII	topyli	I have a windows box and linux box connected to a router that I'm trying o see the windwos box shares and vice versa
2006-01-07T15:32:00.000Z	KarlosII	topyli	ummm
2006-01-07T15:33:00.000Z	topyli	KarlosII	i really don't have any shares on windows computers and probably never will. so i don't know how windows networking really works. i just know how to connect them to unix boxen as clients :)
2006-01-07T16:19:00.000Z	topyli	KarlosII	oh :)
2006-01-08T16:03:00.000Z	topyli	KarlosII	still fighting the samba daemons i see ;-)
