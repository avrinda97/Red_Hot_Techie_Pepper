2006-06-18T07:19:00.000Z	AndreasB		Hi there. i have a problem with the ubuntu installer. it sits at "installing the base system" and then quits. Can anyone help?
2006-06-18T07:20:00.000Z	ompaul	AndreasB	which version of ubuntu?
2006-06-18T07:20:00.000Z	AndreasB	ompaul	6.06 i386
2006-06-18T07:20:00.000Z	ompaul	AndreasB	which disk?
2006-06-18T07:20:00.000Z	AndreasB	ompaul	but i'm installing on a amd64. i've read and followed the howto for this.
2006-06-18T07:21:00.000Z	AndreasB	ompaul	/dev/sda. configuration by hand. its a 160GB SATA
2006-06-18T07:22:00.000Z	ompaul	AndreasB	I don't have a 64bit system to play with or sata scsi or ide thats me
2006-06-18T07:23:00.000Z	ompaul	AndreasB	have you checked the checksum for that disk before you burnt?
2006-06-18T07:23:00.000Z	AndreasB	ompaul	yes.
2006-06-18T07:33:00.000Z	ompaul	AndreasB	so then I point to the install media, bt then they are all 32bit versions perhaps?
2006-06-18T07:24:00.000Z	ompaul	AndreasB	have a look at wiki.ubuntu.com/BootOptions it may help
2006-06-18T07:25:00.000Z	AndreasB	ompaul	i have already had a look at that and i think i found the best boot options.
2006-06-18T07:26:00.000Z	ompaul	AndreasB	well then your way ahead of where I can help
2006-06-18T07:26:00.000Z	ompaul	AndreasB	suggest the mailing list I'll grab the url
2006-06-18T07:26:00.000Z	AndreasB	ompaul	mh. ok. Thanks anyway. I have the mailing list set up ;)
2006-06-18T07:28:00.000Z	ompaul	AndreasB	have a look at help.ubuntu.com it is rather comprehensive
2006-06-18T07:31:00.000Z	AndreasB	ompaul	mh. i did have a look on all the documentation on help.ubuntu.com. i'm afraid i was not able to find any advanced installation documentation other than the articles in the wiki.
2006-06-18T07:32:00.000Z	ompaul	AndreasB	if I was you I would try a live cd or some such to test that the machine works
2006-06-18T07:33:00.000Z	AndreasB	ompaul	Knoppix, Gentoo, debian and fedora work flawlessly ;)
2006-06-18T07:34:00.000Z	AndreasB	ompaul	yes. i did not like the 64 bit versions at all. i do use the 32 bit version of ubuntu, tough.
2006-06-18T07:35:00.000Z	ompaul	AndreasB	 I have nothing further to add other than maybe a new download and install - the alternate disk or something or the DVD if you have the time
2006-06-18T07:36:00.000Z	AndreasB	ompaul	yeah, i think i'll go to bed and wait for the dvd download to finish. i'ts worth a try. Thanks anyway for your help!
