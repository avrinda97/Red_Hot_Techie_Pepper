2010-05-29T09:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	projektidiot	I've never heard of a netbook that couldn't boot from USB before, are you sure that the drive is bootable (have you tried booting it from another computer)? Are you sure that the USB port works?
2010-05-29T09:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	projektidiot	Is the drive readable from windows (or whatever OS currently have on the netbook)?
2010-05-29T09:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	projektidiot	If you don't use my full nick your messages to me won't be highlighted in my client.
2010-05-29T09:10:00.000Z	projektidiot	Jordan_U	oh, word
2010-05-29T09:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	projektidiot	This should not matter unless you have a braindead BIOS, but is the first partition maked "active"?
2010-05-29T09:11:00.000Z	projektidiot	Jordan_U	by first do you mean the one with Windows on it? And should it be marked active in Windows or the BIOS?
2010-05-29T09:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	projektidiot	I mean the first partition on the flash drive (which I assume has only Ubuntu on it).
2010-05-29T09:14:00.000Z	projektidiot	Jordan_U	yeah, it says active
2010-05-29T09:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	projektidiot	Have you ever booted from USB with this netbook?
2010-05-29T09:14:00.000Z	projektidiot	Jordan_U	no, just got it today.
2010-05-29T09:17:00.000Z	projektidiot	Jordan_U	if I install it through WUBI then run it, would I be able to install from inside the WUBI Ubuntu?
2010-05-29T09:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	projektidiot	Yes, with some fancy tricks.
2010-05-29T09:18:00.000Z	projektidiot	Jordan_U	alright, what would those be?
2010-05-29T09:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	projektidiot	Actually, first check in your BIOS menu for an option labeled "legacy USB support" or similar, enable it if it's disabled.
2010-05-29T09:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	projektidiot	What you do depends on a few factors.
2010-05-29T09:22:00.000Z	projektidiot	Jordan_U	nah, I don't have anything like that
2010-05-29T09:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	projektidiot	Install via wubi, then hold shift when booting into Ubuntu to get the grub menu. Press 'c' to get to a grub shell and then 'ls -l' to list your drives.
2010-05-29T09:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	projektidiot	If you see your USB drive listed in the 'ls -l' output then you are lucky and you can setup grub to boot from the flash drive. If not (which seems likely, though surprising with a netbook) then what I would do is copy a liveCD iso that has a "Copy to RAM" type option to your hard drive, I recommend grml as it's especially easy to loop boot like this.
2010-05-29T09:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	projektidiot	Then to install Ubuntu you'd follow either: http://lubi.sourceforge.net/lvpm.html or
2010-05-29T09:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	projektidiot	... Or I just realized that there is also an official guide for installing Ubuntu from within another linux distro (though it may need some adjusting for wubi)
2010-05-29T09:35:00.000Z	projektidiot	Jordan_U	very cool, many thanks.
2010-05-29T09:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	projektidiot	You're welcome.
