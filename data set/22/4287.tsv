2008-01-28T22:43:00.000Z	shift1		i mean can it mess up my system, or really ruin how ubutnu runs like the "pop-up" claims?
2008-01-28T22:44:00.000Z	shift1		how can i make it so i dont have to use password to sign-in to ubuntu every time i login, right now im logging in as "home" is that the higest user? it wont let me login as root.. or if you can how do you do that?
2008-01-28T22:44:00.000Z	shift1		uhuh
2008-01-28T22:45:00.000Z	shift1		okay well, how can i make it so "home" does not keep asking for a password each time i boot, or every time i try to install an app.
2008-01-28T22:45:00.000Z	shift1		okay thats fine, thank you. i just want to remove the password off "home"
2008-01-28T22:46:00.000Z	shift1		yes in the list of "users" i have "home" and "root"
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	shift1		well i see "home" and "root"
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	shift1		oh okay
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	shift1		thats fine then
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	shift1		okay well would removing LOGIN password be bad?
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	adelie	shift1	while it can be annoying, it is an important security thing. this keeps random things from being able to install stuff for you without your permission. reason why in part linux has no viruses to speak of. either type `sudo su` before beginning your 'administrative work, or restart into single user mode
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	adelie	shift1	removing a password from root would be VERY bad
2008-01-28T22:48:00.000Z	shift1	adelie	can i message u?
2008-01-28T22:48:00.000Z	adelie	shift1	yes
2008-01-28T23:11:00.000Z	adelie	shift1	installing mozilla-vlc and/or ubuntu-restricted-packages from universe should fix the youtube problem ,if you live outside the united states ;)
2008-01-28T23:12:00.000Z	adelie	shift1	I may have the vlc package mane wrong, but search synaptic for packages whose name begins with mozilla and you will find an appropriate package sifting through the results
2008-01-28T23:38:00.000Z	adelie	shift1	`apt-get update && apt-get upgrade`
2008-01-28T23:39:00.000Z	adelie	shift1	as root, of course
2008-01-28T23:50:00.000Z	adelie	shift1	IMHO vlc
2008-01-28T23:50:00.000Z	adelie	shift1	vlc can do anything
2008-01-28T23:50:00.000Z	adelie	shift1	in windows?
2008-01-28T23:51:00.000Z	adelie	shift1	check out #windows. there are lots of linux people there too, and would give better help
