2005-09-22T13:53:00.000Z	elvirolo		oh i'm getting fed up, it still doesn't work
2005-09-22T13:53:00.000Z	elvirolo		i mean why doesn't ubuntu do that *by default* ??
2005-09-22T13:54:00.000Z	bob2	elvirolo	do what by default?
2005-09-22T13:54:00.000Z	elvirolo	bob2	activate my wifi network interface at boot time
2005-09-23T09:38:00.000Z	bob2	elvirolo	perhaps the module is loading too late
2005-09-23T09:39:00.000Z	elvirolo	bob2	could be yeah
2005-09-23T09:39:00.000Z	elvirolo	bob2	should i fill in a bug report ?
2005-09-23T09:39:00.000Z	bob2	elvirolo	are the drivers for whatever card you have in ubuntu?
2005-09-23T09:40:00.000Z	elvirolo	bob2	yeah, it's the ra2500 module i think
2005-09-23T09:40:00.000Z	bob2	elvirolo	not really an ubuntu bug, sadly
2005-09-23T09:41:00.000Z	elvirolo	bob2	oh, what can i do then ?
2005-09-23T09:41:00.000Z	bob2	elvirolo	how are you loading the modules?
2005-09-23T09:41:00.000Z	elvirolo	bob2	 they are loaded at startup, presumably
2005-09-23T09:42:00.000Z	bob2	elvirolo	you're not doing anything to have it loaded?
2005-09-23T09:42:00.000Z	elvirolo	bob2	no, the card was detected by network-admin anyway
2005-09-23T09:45:00.000Z	bob2	elvirolo	glxgears is not a useful benchmark of anything
2005-09-23T09:46:00.000Z	elvirolo	bob2	it still make a huge difference
2005-09-23T09:46:00.000Z	bob2	elvirolo	if it's slower with the same config, file a bug
2005-09-23T09:46:00.000Z	elvirolo	bob2	 i used to be able to play arkhart, and now i only get like 5 FPS
2005-09-23T09:47:00.000Z	elvirolo	bob2	what info should i join with the bug report ?
2005-09-23T09:47:00.000Z	bob2	elvirolo	lspci, dmesg, X config, X log
2005-09-23T09:48:00.000Z	elvirolo	bob2	ok
