2012-02-28T21:05:00.000Z	_Marcus	mi3	Naw
2012-02-28T20:43:00.000Z	mi3	_Marcus	log out of the session, then at the login window on the bottom side you will see Desktop in that you can select whichever you want like gnome with effects, no effects, recovery console, etc.
2012-02-28T20:44:00.000Z	_Marcus	mi3	I logged out, and there is nothing at the bottom.
2012-02-28T20:44:00.000Z	mi3	_Marcus	there will be a session selection at the bottom which release do you use?
2012-02-28T20:45:00.000Z	_Marcus	mi3	11.10
2012-02-28T20:46:00.000Z	mi3	_Marcus	there ought to be some kind of a session selector option in the login screen, thats what I know.
2012-02-28T20:47:00.000Z	_Marcus	mi3	There is "Guest Session" but that's just a guest account
2012-02-28T20:55:00.000Z	mi3	_Marcus	frankly speaking I downloaded the ubuntu 11.10 iso, installed it on my system, saw unity trying to be the boss, and removed it within 10 mins of install lol
2012-02-28T21:04:00.000Z	_Marcus	mi3	I am going to install gnome from software center, and then uninstall Unity from software center.
2012-02-28T21:04:00.000Z	mi3	_Marcus	maybe you should use natty,ehh?
2012-02-28T21:04:00.000Z	_Marcus	mi3	11.04?
2012-02-28T21:05:00.000Z	mi3	_Marcus	natty is for all those who are unity hater, no offense
2012-02-28T21:06:00.000Z	_Marcus	mi3	I like 11.10, but I don't like Unity
2012-02-28T21:06:00.000Z	mi3	_Marcus	same goes for me, i hate unity [i mean why would someone introduce that in the name of usability?]
2012-02-28T21:07:00.000Z	_Marcus	mi3	It reminds me a lot of OS X though, so I like it a bit.
2012-02-28T21:08:00.000Z	mi3	_Marcus	:( [never have a mac, so cant say :)]
