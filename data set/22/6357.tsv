2006-11-28T09:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U		My gnome power applet says I am not running on battery when I am, so when I do run out of battery the computer shuts down improperly because gnome-power-management doesn't think it needs to shut down when the laptop is plugged in, which it is not.

2008-06-19T09:06:00.000Z	axisys	Jordan_U	how do I choose it after it found the url?
2008-06-19T09:06:00.000Z	axisys	Jordan_U	I hate to manually edit the sources.list
2008-06-19T09:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	axisys	It should create a sources.list ( in your home directory? ) first *check to see that the sources.list is correct* then copy it over to /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-06-19T09:09:00.000Z	axisys	Jordan_U	the sources.list in my home dir has only one line that is uncommented with the correct url.. but the main one has 18 uncommented url
