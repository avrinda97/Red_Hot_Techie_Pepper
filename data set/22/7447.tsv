2006-04-01T15:47:00.000Z	GNUstye		can an Ip adress harm me?
2006-04-01T15:49:00.000Z	GNUstye		I mean if anybody knows my ip could they gain acces to my system?
2006-04-01T15:51:00.000Z	GNUstye		if I give you my root password can u ssh me?
2006-04-01T15:51:00.000Z	GNUstye		my ip is 10.0.0.1
2006-04-01T15:52:00.000Z	GNUstye		can anybody crack the root pass
2006-04-01T15:52:00.000Z	GNUstye		?
2006-04-01T15:52:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	no
2006-04-01T15:53:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	it takes a little effort. and you should disable root login in sshd_config
2006-04-01T15:53:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	and never use the same password for root and users that can ssh
2006-04-01T15:54:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	they usually dont crack bruteforce, like trying out a billion combinations to your root password. usually cracks are based on exploits - bugs in the ssh-daemon for example, or many other things
2006-04-01T15:56:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	not known ones, but everything has bugs.
2006-04-01T15:57:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	people argue over it. with an open source environment there might be exploits, but there are just as quickly fixes.
2006-04-01T15:58:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	yeah, putty can use the ssh protocol
2006-04-01T15:58:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	but its not an ssh server, if that was what you were wondering
2006-04-01T15:59:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	openssh-server. oh, yeah, like YukiCuss says :)
2006-04-01T16:00:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	every computer you ever lay your hands on will have a zillion bugs
2006-04-01T16:01:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	bugs get fixed. new programs that are better than the last ones get introduced. they have new bugs. they get fixed. ad inifintum.
2006-04-01T16:01:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	then you know that it takes very little for a program to do something its not supposed to do
2006-04-01T16:03:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	"cracking" a password is something pretty old fashioned, i think. it seldom happens.
2006-04-01T16:04:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	just think. you try to enter the wrong password, or send the wrong password. yahoo takes 7 seconds to respond, telling you it is wrong, you send another..
2006-04-01T16:06:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	they're the cia. they know when you go to the toilet.
2006-04-01T16:06:00.000Z	kingspwned	GNUstye	we should probably take this to #ubuntu-offtopic
