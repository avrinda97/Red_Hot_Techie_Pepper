2009-07-17T14:04:00.000Z	promethean		I'm trying to install/upgrade ubuntu on a computer that already has the previous version.  First I tried to upgrade using the Internet, which failed.  Then I tried using a new disk to upgrade from, and that didn't work.  So then I tried doing a fresh install and that didn't work.
2009-07-17T14:05:00.000Z	moncky	promethean	that doesnt make sense, how did a fresh install fail?
2009-07-17T14:09:00.000Z	promethean	moncky	I guess I didn't do the fresh install.  I scanned the disk and it said there were 7 errors.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the disk.  Should I just go ahead and use it?
2009-07-17T14:09:00.000Z	moncky	promethean	depends on what the disk errors actually are
2009-07-17T14:10:00.000Z	moncky	promethean	if you have a running system use fsck to check and try to repair the errors then apt-get upgrade to upgrade
2009-07-17T14:11:00.000Z	promethean		I used synaptic to fix broken packages and I updated what it would let me.  Is that the same thing?
2009-07-17T14:44:00.000Z	promethean		monky,  does my filesystem need to be mounted when I use fsck?
2009-07-17T14:45:00.000Z	moncky	promethean	you can force a fsck at boot if you need to, though im not sure howto of the top of my heak
2009-07-17T14:45:00.000Z	moncky		s/heak/head
2009-07-17T14:46:00.000Z	promethean	moncky	I am able to boot up into ubuntu
2009-07-17T14:47:00.000Z	moncky	promethean	so have you been able to upgrade with apt-get dist-upgrade?
2009-07-17T14:48:00.000Z	promethean	moncky	I didn't try with apt-get, but it it failed to upgrade using the upgrade manager
2009-07-17T14:49:00.000Z	moncky	promethean	did it give you an error message?
2009-07-17T14:49:00.000Z	promethean	moncky	yes
2009-07-17T14:50:00.000Z	moncky	promethean	what did it say?
2009-07-17T14:51:00.000Z	promethean	moncky	I believe it said that I had broken packages, which is why I then tried to fix them, and failed.
2009-07-17T14:52:00.000Z	moncky	promethean	go to a terminal and type sudo atp-get update
2009-07-17T14:53:00.000Z	moncky	promethean	then sudo apt-get check
2009-07-17T14:53:00.000Z	promethean	moncky	 thanks, I will.  I'll have to go off line on this computer to update that one.
2009-07-17T14:54:00.000Z	moncky	promethean	also have a look at the -f option in apto
2009-07-17T14:55:00.000Z	promethean	moncky	apto?
2009-07-17T14:56:00.000Z	promethean	moncky	thanks for the help.
