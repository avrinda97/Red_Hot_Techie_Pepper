2006-09-16T12:14:00.000Z	rummik		hey, i'm having trouble with the sound on here, it seems to be playing everything about 1/2 the speed it should, which makes the voices sound deep and movies studder.
2006-09-16T12:15:00.000Z	sklav	rummik	check that dma is enabled
2006-09-16T12:15:00.000Z	rummik	sklav	how do i do that?
2006-09-16T12:18:00.000Z	rummik	sklav	it's not just movies, it's *everything* that has slow sound, like streaming audio from internet radio stations
2006-09-16T12:18:00.000Z	sklav	rummik	it sounds like a dma issue
2006-09-16T12:20:00.000Z	rummik	sklav	it's just audio stuff and it was working perfectly from the cd, and last night aswell, so i don't think it's dma
2006-09-16T12:20:00.000Z	sklav	rummik	what is the load average?
2006-09-16T12:20:00.000Z	rummik	sklav	5%
2006-09-16T12:21:00.000Z	rummik	sklav	yeah, few times
2006-09-16T12:23:00.000Z	rummik	sklav	would dma be an issue with on board sound?
2006-09-16T12:24:00.000Z	sklav	rummik	yes because it reading it from the hdd
2006-09-16T12:25:00.000Z	rummik	sklav	so, half speed sound being a constant would be dma then? even for internet radio?
2006-09-16T12:25:00.000Z	sklav	rummik	from experience yes as for internet radio its buffered on the hdd also
2006-09-16T12:26:00.000Z	rummik	sklav	ok, i'
2006-09-16T12:29:00.000Z	rummik	sklav	i just enabled dma for the drive the linux partition and swap space is on, still the same problems...
2006-09-16T12:29:00.000Z	sklav	rummik	did you mess with any audio settings example alsa?
2006-09-16T12:29:00.000Z	rummik	sklav	not that i know of...i've been installing codecs today, though
2006-09-16T12:30:00.000Z	sklav	rummik	can it be a conflict with codecs?
2006-09-16T12:31:00.000Z	rummik	sklav	i don't think so, i've installed the same codecs that i have on my laptop
2006-09-16T12:31:00.000Z	sklav	rummik	im at a loss somewhat
2006-09-16T12:32:00.000Z	rummik	sklav	do you know how i would change the sound output settings? because that sounds like the problem
2006-09-16T12:33:00.000Z	rummik	sklav	ah, ok
