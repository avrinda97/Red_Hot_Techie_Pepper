2009-11-02T00:02:00.000Z	m0ar		How can I make flash to always maximize at the main monitor?
2009-11-02T00:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	m0ar	 most likely - you cant.
2009-11-02T00:02:00.000Z	m0ar	Dr_Willis	D'aww, how come?
2009-11-02T00:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	m0ar	 because adobe is stupid. :)  i use 2 monitors and flash is a pain.
2009-11-02T00:03:00.000Z	m0ar	Dr_Willis	Okay.. Thanks
2009-11-02T00:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	m0ar	 i maxamize it and click on the 2nd montiro and it unmaxamizes
2009-12-27T19:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	m0ar	 theres some 7z command line tools - check the package manager
2009-12-27T19:11:00.000Z	m0ar	Dr_Willis	Any tips?
2009-12-27T19:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	m0ar	 learn to search  with the pacakge manager tools... perhaps. :)
2009-12-27T19:11:00.000Z	m0ar	Dr_Willis	Well, true.. Thanks
2009-12-27T19:18:00.000Z	m0ar	Dr_Willis	I don't understand how to extract them via line, can you help me out?
2009-12-27T19:18:00.000Z	m0ar	Dr_Willis	I've read the 7z-help, but I'm not getting it to work
2009-12-27T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	m0ar	 Usage: 7z <command> [<switches>...] <archive_name> [<file_names>...]
2009-12-27T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	m0ar	 thus  its 7z X whatever.7z
2009-12-27T19:19:00.000Z	m0ar	Dr_Willis	I know, but I couldn't get it to extract to a set folder
2009-12-27T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	m0ar	 cd to the dir.. and use the command i guess
2009-12-27T19:20:00.000Z	m0ar	Dr_Willis	Cannot use absolute pathnames for this command
2009-12-27T19:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	m0ar	 regular expressions, or give each file on the command line. but not the others
2009-12-27T19:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	m0ar	 try it and see.. i thinkit will
2010-03-16T16:03:00.000Z	m0ar	Dr_Willis	Wouldn't that be safer in a vritualized environment?
2010-03-16T16:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	m0ar	 i just needed to do some quick tests and see what files it installed where
2010-03-16T16:04:00.000Z	m0ar	Dr_Willis	Ah :)
