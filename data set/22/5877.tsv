2007-02-03T16:51:00.000Z	frogzoo		 dooooomi /etc/environment
2007-02-03T16:52:00.000Z	dooooomi	frogzoo	that's what i thought, but it doesn't work
2007-02-03T16:53:00.000Z	dooooomi	frogzoo	it works for other variables, but somehow $LD_LIBRARY_PATH seems to be a special case
2007-02-03T16:55:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooooomi	you log out/back in?
2007-02-03T16:56:00.000Z	dooooomi	frogzoo	yep, didn't help
2007-02-03T17:07:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooooomi	you want ldconfig methinks
2007-02-03T17:08:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooooomi	strange /etc/environment doesn't work - you weren't using env variables in there were you?
2007-02-03T17:09:00.000Z	dooooomi	frogzoo	nope, i weren't. i don't understand why this didn't work either, but somewhere else the value of $LD_LIBRARY_PATH seems to be reset
2007-02-03T17:09:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooooomi	sure, just add it to /etc/ld.so.conf   & run ldconfig
2007-02-03T17:10:00.000Z	dooooomi	frogzoo	yeah, but then the library in /usr/lib will still be found before my own version
2007-02-03T17:13:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooooomi	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/xxx
2007-02-03T17:13:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooooomi	in /etc/environment - definately sets the env var, just checked it
2007-02-03T17:14:00.000Z	dooooomi	frogzoo	i'll try it again...
2007-02-03T17:14:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooooomi	check that /etc/environment is 644
2007-02-03T17:18:00.000Z	dooooomi	frogzoo	well, it works in a text mode console, but not in X
2007-02-03T17:18:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooooomi	can't win :(
2007-02-03T17:18:00.000Z	dooooomi	frogzoo	the weird thing is that i can set other variables in /etc/environment, but not $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
2007-02-03T17:43:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooooomi	clearly X or gnome is resetting the variable
2007-02-03T17:44:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooooomi	does this need to be global or just per user?
2007-02-03T17:47:00.000Z	dooooomi	frogzoo	global would be nice, but i guess a per user solution might do as well
2007-02-03T17:47:00.000Z	frogzoo	dooooomi	why not set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in ~/.gnomerc ?
2007-02-03T17:47:00.000Z	dooooomi	frogzoo	because i'm not running gnome ;)
