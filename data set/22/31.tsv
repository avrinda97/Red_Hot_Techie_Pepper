2012-11-21T01:27:00.000Z	gustav__		I'm seeing a lot of scanning on port 22. UFW is blocking. Should I be worried?
2012-11-21T01:29:00.000Z	gustav__		How can they sniff? O_O
2012-11-21T01:29:00.000Z	Pici	gustav__	they can't.
2012-11-21T01:29:00.000Z	Pici	gustav__	I wouldn't worry about it.  You may want to install something like fail2ban though.
2012-11-21T01:30:00.000Z	gustav__	Pici	Will that work with ufw? Can't ufw ban automatically? But, they're kinda already banned though... with ufw.
2012-11-21T01:32:00.000Z	Pici	gustav__	fail2ban works by examining system logs rather than the connections themselves.  It temporarily bans people why fail to login to ssh after a small number of tries (like 5)
2012-11-21T01:33:00.000Z	Pici	gustav__	The police?  I doubt its targeting towards you specifically.
2012-11-21T01:33:00.000Z	gustav__	Pici	I am seeming attempts against my host.
2012-11-21T01:34:00.000Z	Pici	gustav__	so does every other computer connected to the internet.
2012-11-21T01:34:00.000Z	gustav__	Pici	That doesn't make it less specific.
2012-11-21T01:36:00.000Z	Pici	gustav__	Excuse me? You're free to do whatever you want about this. I'm just telling you that failed ssh logins from random addresses is by no means an indication that someone is targetting you.  Infected hosts do these sorts of things all the time.  If you want to report it to someone, the honeypot project that the internet storm center has things that will allow you to report troublesome IPs
2012-11-21T01:46:00.000Z	Pici	gustav__	are you sure that isn't your mac address?
2012-11-21T01:47:00.000Z	gustav__	Pici	A part is.
2012-11-21T02:08:00.000Z	Pici	gustav__	you're straying offtopic again.  If you're looking for best-practice ideas for your network, this isn't the place to ask about them.
2012-11-21T02:08:00.000Z	gustav__	Pici	What's the topic?
2012-11-21T02:08:00.000Z	Pici	gustav__	Ubuntu Tech Support.
2012-11-21T02:09:00.000Z	gustav__	Pici	How would you categories my issue?
2012-11-21T02:10:00.000Z	Pici	gustav__	Network Paranoia.  But seriously, you've been given a few options, but you seem to think that even with the solutions that Ubuntu has that you're in danger of being hacked.  I don't think that constitutes a support topic.
2012-11-21T02:11:00.000Z	Pici	gustav__	if you're looking for a discussion of network security practices, ##security would be more on-topic.
2012-11-21T02:12:00.000Z	Pici	gustav__	you've been speaking to an op this entire time, believe me, we're here.
2012-11-21T02:13:00.000Z	gustav__	Pici	Figures why nothing is done about all of these personal attacks, and now I mean the support discourse.
2012-11-21T02:14:00.000Z	Pici	gustav__	Not everything needs to result in a kick. Anyway, I think you'll get a better discussion of your options through a non-distro specific method.
