2010-08-24T16:01:00.000Z	rewire		hey there, im having trouble with getting my wifi to work since an update
2010-08-24T16:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	rewire	 try lsusb or lshw  what device is it?
2010-08-24T16:06:00.000Z	rewire	sacarlson	well using iwconfig tells me its a RaLink STA, lshw tells me theres an Atheros AR8132, if i try and plug my ubuntu machine into another ubuntu computer that's working, eth0 fails to connect to the net
2010-08-24T16:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	rewire	seems that device has a history.  I think you need to find a driver to compile or find another kernel 2.6.27 that suposed to have it already
2010-08-24T16:10:00.000Z	rewire	sacarlson	cheers :D is there any hassle free way of doing it? via .deb or apt-get?
2010-08-24T16:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	rewire	you might try jockey-gtk
2010-08-24T16:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	rewire	but I think the working one is an open source solution
2010-08-24T16:12:00.000Z	rewire	sacarlson	so where would i go to get it?
2010-08-24T16:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	rewire	jokey-gtk  System>administration>Hardware driver
2010-08-24T16:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	rewire	and the kernel there must be a deb file for
2010-08-24T16:14:00.000Z	rewire	sacarlson	yeah i tryed that and simply got "no propriartary drivers are in use on this system"
2010-08-24T16:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	rewire	I'm still looking for the kernel deb file
2010-08-24T16:19:00.000Z	rewire	sacarlson	cheers :D apparently the driver required is for the Ralink3090 PCIe card
2010-08-24T16:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	rewire	so we looking for the wrong ones?
2010-08-24T16:20:00.000Z	rewire	sacarlson	heres what ive seen http://www.linlap.com/wiki/asus+eee+pc+1001ha
2010-08-24T16:21:00.000Z	rewire	sacarlson	but ive tryed installing those drivers with no success
2010-08-24T16:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	rewire	I found this one http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1219931
2010-08-24T16:22:00.000Z	rewire	sacarlson	looks good :D is there a command to display my kernal version?
2010-08-24T16:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	rewire	uname -a
2010-08-24T16:22:00.000Z	rewire	sacarlson	cheers :D
