2011-07-03T10:58:00.000Z	frybye		Hi - the musik library I imported into banschee from my windows d: drive is not responding this morning.. any tips?
2011-07-03T10:59:00.000Z	westz	frybye	make sure the volume is mounted?
2011-07-03T10:59:00.000Z	frybye	westz	are you on the -payroll- of a govt. agency? ;=)
2011-07-03T11:00:00.000Z	westz	frybye	technically, not for another 9 days (i'm dead serious actually)
2011-07-03T11:00:00.000Z	frybye	westz	- how to be sure..
2011-07-03T11:01:00.000Z	frybye	westz	you shouldn't be bragging about it here pal hh rbdwccc
2011-07-03T11:01:00.000Z	frybye	westz	- topic changed by rbddcc
2011-07-03T11:03:00.000Z	frybye	westz	and if volume control is operational for other sound apps and the songs in the banschee still not responding ...?
2011-07-03T11:04:00.000Z	frybye	westz	my problem is lack of experiance with -specific- ubuntu stuff - if you follow me...
2011-07-03T11:04:00.000Z	westz	frybye	what release? 11.04?
2011-07-03T11:05:00.000Z	frybye	westz	sure thing x64 11.04
2011-07-03T11:09:00.000Z	frybye	westz	assuming useing the import function in banshee to get content from a different drive - the content lands within the ubuntu environment - so it should not matter an iota if the drive (formally known as d:) is mounted or not - cos it will all be on /home now or?
2011-07-03T11:10:00.000Z	westz	frybye	exactly what error are you getting, if any
2011-07-03T11:11:00.000Z	frybye	westz	I now see that despite "import" yesterday - there is NO music at /~/music grrr...
2011-07-03T11:11:00.000Z	westz	frybye	just for accuracy, you mean ~/music
2011-07-03T11:11:00.000Z	frybye	westz	so I had better go and manually copy the data there - yes  ~/music
2011-07-03T11:12:00.000Z	westz	frybye	try to mount D: and see if it works then, firstly
2011-07-03T11:13:00.000Z	westz	frybye	banshee's "import" doesnt move any files, it just adds their current paths to the library
2011-07-03T11:13:00.000Z	westz	frybye	permission errors possibly?
2011-07-03T11:25:00.000Z	frybye	westz	seems to be fixed - don't ask me how - re- reading the library was part of it but not all - I am 62yo and have only recently got the meds for approaching dement. on the govt. insur. scheme here in Germany - (am brit. airforce veter from a german/english family who used to do german/UK stuff at jhq
2011-07-03T11:25:00.000Z	frybye	westz	in my case left service more than 24yrs ago...
2011-07-03T11:26:00.000Z	frybye	westz	thanks for your input..
