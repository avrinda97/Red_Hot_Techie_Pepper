2007-06-28T07:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	msl Try installing bcm43xx-fwcutter first
2007-06-28T07:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	msl Before NDIS wrapper that is
2007-06-28T08:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	The .deb for bcm43xx-fwcutter still needs you to be connected to the Internet because it grabs the firmware from broadcom's site
2007-06-28T08:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	What do you mean?
2007-06-28T08:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	No, you need to be connected to the internet to do it automatically, I can give you a link to the firmware though, you just need to put it in /lib/firmware
2007-06-28T08:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	http://trogdoor.googlepages.com/firmware.zip
2007-06-28T08:11:00.000Z	bzaks	Jordan_U	Can you help me now with this fwcutter thing? Do I need to get the deb still?
2007-06-28T08:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	No, you should still install fwcutter once you are connected to the internet with the laptop just so your firmware gets updated automatically, but all you need is the firmware to connect now
2007-06-28T08:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	Yes, you will need to use sudo to do it though ( it requires root privaleges )
2007-06-28T08:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	No, just reboot or run: sudo modprobe bcm43xx-fwcutter
2007-06-28T08:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	No, just reboot or run: sudo modprobe bcm43xx
2007-06-28T08:17:00.000Z	bzaks	Jordan_U	should I see something?
2007-06-28T08:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	No
2007-06-28T08:18:00.000Z	bzaks	Jordan_U	So I just have internet? even though network manager says nothing?
2007-06-28T08:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	Now try to connect with the network manager applet
2007-06-28T08:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	Network manager should see it now, check that the card is in roaming mode in System -> Administration -> networking
2007-06-28T08:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	Yes, but as long as it's set to manual in netwok-admin it won't show up in network-manager
2007-06-28T08:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	It should work now, try setting it to roaming instead of adding the ssid yourself and see if it shows up in network-manager
2007-06-28T08:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	I gave you firmware for all models I think, hence the multiple .fw files
2007-06-28T08:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	I may have forgotten a step ( though I don't think I did ) try rebooting as that should do anything I might have forgotten
2007-06-28T08:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	That means I forgot something, glad it works :)
2007-06-28T08:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bzaks	Nope
