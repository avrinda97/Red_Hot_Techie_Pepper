2009-06-07T04:11:00.000Z	hou5ton		I installed a timer-applet, but it doesn't show up in Applications.
2009-06-07T04:11:00.000Z	hou5ton		I did whereis timer-applet, and found some of the files
2009-06-07T04:12:00.000Z	hou5ton		What kind of file is the equivalent of the .exe. file in Windows?
2009-06-07T04:12:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	nothing
2009-06-07T04:12:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	you chmod +x it
2009-06-07T04:12:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	file extentions are just names... so linux ignores them
2009-06-07T04:13:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	you chmod +x a file to make it executable
2009-06-07T04:13:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	but of course it has to be a binary file in the first place...
2009-06-07T04:36:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	then what do you mean by application
2009-06-07T04:36:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	alacarte
2009-06-07T04:37:00.000Z	hou5ton	racecar56	 what the command line would be to start it, as opposed to clicking on it in the Application dropdown menu
2009-06-07T04:37:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	even though, the command line for a program IS the program
2009-06-07T04:37:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	mine is a dropup
2009-06-07T04:37:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	e.g. Firefix would be firefox
2009-06-07T04:37:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	type
2009-06-07T04:37:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	typ
2009-06-07T04:37:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	TYPO
2009-06-07T04:38:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	i type so bad sometimes i can't even spell typo right
2009-06-07T04:38:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	well the O key fell off... and the P is loose
2009-06-07T04:38:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	cheap laptop
2009-06-07T04:38:00.000Z	racecar56	hou5ton	:P
2009-06-07T04:39:00.000Z	hou5ton	racecar56	mdg: It seems there should be a straightforward way to know the command for any application???
