2008-02-29T04:39:00.000Z	daef	kenro	etherape is when you plug a crossed cable into a switch without spanning tree and wait for a broadcast-package...
2008-02-29T04:40:00.000Z	kenro	daef	 Yeah you said that. I did that. Silly me, I plugged into a power outlet, not a dataport. I was in a coma for 6 weeks.
2008-02-29T04:41:00.000Z	daef	kenro	ah.......
2008-02-29T04:41:00.000Z	kenro	daef	 tat was the second time I did that.

2008-02-29T04:47:00.000Z	daef	kenro	my roleplay-time ended when i started working ;)
2008-02-29T04:48:00.000Z	kenro	daef	You've heard the saying 'I don't work. Takes away my fishing time'?
