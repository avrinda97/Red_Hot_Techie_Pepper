2006-04-22T16:35:00.000Z	mustang97		wierd..  says its already installed
2006-04-22T06:22:00.000Z	mustang97		I'm tryin to get eggdrop working.   I installed the eggdrop package.. found the folder but no config file or any of the other files.    How do I go about getting eggdrop working?    I tried to get eggdrop and compile myself but its saying it needs some libtcl.so .. I installed activetcl and it still wont work.
2006-04-22T06:22:00.000Z	mustang97		any suggestions?
2006-04-22T06:22:00.000Z	Hackmo	mustang97	install tcl4.8-dev
2006-04-22T06:22:00.000Z	mustang97		lemme go try that
2006-04-22T06:24:00.000Z	mustang97	Hackmo	4.8?  I did a google search and no results..  I tried 8.4 and got a result (remember seeing somfin bout 8.4 earlier)
2006-04-22T06:25:00.000Z	Hackmo	mustang97	yeah, i'm sorry it's 8.4
2006-04-22T06:25:00.000Z	mustang97	Hackmo	okay.. thanks.. was making sure before I installed..
2006-04-22T06:25:00.000Z	Hackmo	mustang97	sudo apt-get install tcl8.4-dev
2006-04-22T06:26:00.000Z	Hackmo	mustang97	after that then compile/install eggdrop using the latest version from there site
2006-04-22T06:26:00.000Z	mustang97		oh. much easier then what I was bout to do..  was gonna download off their site and try to install that way.
2006-04-22T06:26:00.000Z	mustang97		yea.. I already got the eggdrop
2006-04-22T06:27:00.000Z	mustang97	Hackmo	I'm used to installing / configureing eggdrop..  just not with setting up a pc to run eggdrop.. :)
2006-04-22T06:27:00.000Z	Hackmo	mustang97	yeah me too, the only reason I knew how to solve your problem is because I installed eggdrop like 3 hours ago
2006-04-22T06:29:00.000Z	mustang97	Hackmo	ahh.. good deal then

2006-04-22T06:33:00.000Z	mustang97	Hackmo	wow.. that coulda came in handy yesterday..  I had to figure out bout the c compiler as well..  thanks
2006-04-22T06:34:00.000Z	Hackmo	mustang97	np...you should always check the fourms when you have a problem.  The majority of the time someone else has had the same problem as you and someone else has solved it
