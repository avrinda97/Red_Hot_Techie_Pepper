2009-02-08T03:16:00.000Z	shawnmstout		whats the command to find out how much ram is installed
2009-02-08T03:16:00.000Z	shawnmstout		just want to make sure system is seeing it properly
2009-02-08T03:16:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	free
2009-05-10T13:10:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	gotcha
2009-05-10T13:11:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	depends on how you define 'bottom of the hill'
2009-05-10T13:15:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	well, mandriva uses rpm's, so you might just be barking up a whole other tree then
2009-05-10T13:15:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	let's check something else - were you able to get that other pastebin up?
2009-05-10T13:16:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	hrm, the reconfiguration left it using the vesa driver, which definitely won't work... can you edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf and replace the instances of 'vesa' with 'nv'?
2009-05-10T13:17:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-05-10T13:26:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	could you please pastebin it?
2009-05-10T13:27:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	i'm thinking that maybe you'd just be better off installing the desktop version
2009-05-10T13:31:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	okay, try it like this: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-05-10T13:34:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	what does it ask?
2009-05-10T13:37:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	possibly... cd /etc/X11/ && rgrep -i vesa     what results do you get? pastebin?
2009-05-10T13:40:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	you did type  cd /etc/X11  before running the rgrep command, right?
2009-05-10T13:40:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	then ctrl-c
2009-05-10T13:41:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	make sure you do the cd first :)
2009-05-10T13:42:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	yes.
2009-05-10T13:45:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	ctrl-c and try like this then:  rgrep -i vesa *
2009-05-10T13:47:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	any results?
2009-05-10T13:49:00.000Z	shawnmstout	Gnea	smae thing
2009-05-10T13:49:00.000Z	Gnea	shawnmstout	not sure then... and too tired to continue..sorry :(
