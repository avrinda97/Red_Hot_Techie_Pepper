2009-08-07T22:48:00.000Z	acajou		mlr no, could try that too...
2009-08-07T22:48:00.000Z	acajou		in " Memory: 2573052k/4194304k available (2181k kernel code, 45968k reserved, 1006k data, 368k init, 1702784k highmem"  what does 1702784k highmem mean?
2009-08-07T22:48:00.000Z	th0r	acajou	this is sort of a shot in the dark, but try booting into an earlier kernel.
2009-08-07T22:48:00.000Z	acajou	th0r	good idea
2009-08-07T23:22:00.000Z	th0r	acajou	still looking for the missing memory?
2009-08-07T23:22:00.000Z	acajou	th0r	Indeed.  Bit confused by now...
2009-08-07T23:23:00.000Z	th0r	acajou	well, if the older kernel didn't work my money is on bad chip...move the memory cards around and see if it has an effect
2009-08-07T23:23:00.000Z	th0r	acajou	might just be a loose board
2009-08-07T23:24:00.000Z	acajou	th0r	Ok, I'll try that, try the 64-bit OS and run another memtest...
2009-08-07T23:38:00.000Z	acajou	th0r	I don' t suppose it's possible that this was caused by my video card swap?  It's odd that if I lookin KInfoCenter at my PCI devices, it tells me I have a 512mb viedo card, when it's really 1gb (and reported as such in nvidia-settings).
2009-08-08T00:39:00.000Z	acajou	th0r	OK, got diagnostic on AWOL RAM.
2009-08-08T00:40:00.000Z	th0r	acajou	you found it?
2009-08-08T00:40:00.000Z	acajou	th0r	a) Mem is fully seen with Kubuntu 9.04 64bit
2009-08-08T00:41:00.000Z	acajou	th0r	so 8.04 has a problem with video cards with a lot of memory, apparently (this one has 1gb).
2009-08-08T00:41:00.000Z	acajou	th0r	(and 9.04 32bit as well)
2009-08-08T00:41:00.000Z	th0r	acajou	sure looks like it....good work. If you have a chance put it in the forums for others.
2009-08-08T00:42:00.000Z	acajou	th0r	dunno if there's anything I can do to "fix" it?  Ie still see 3.2gb on the 32bit os?
2009-08-08T00:43:00.000Z	th0r	acajou	I wouldn't even know how to start determining a fix. But it does sound like a hw conflict, which  means there probably isn't much can be done
2009-08-08T00:43:00.000Z	acajou	th0r	OK, will post to the forums shortly. Thanks for all your help!

2009-08-08T01:21:00.000Z	th0r	acajou	well done. Nice to see someone who can write up an issue properly. Hope someone can supply a fix for you
2009-08-08T01:27:00.000Z	acajou	th0r	thanks.  O+O
