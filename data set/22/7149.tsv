2006-07-11T11:44:00.000Z	shadowpanda		davey: you mean make it an exe?
2006-07-11T11:44:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	shadowpanda	chmod +x file
2006-07-11T11:47:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	shadowpanda	I told you, chmod +x file
2006-07-11T11:49:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	shadowpanda	why not run it from terminal ?
2006-07-11T11:50:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	shadowpanda	does the same thing for me
2006-07-11T11:52:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	shadowpanda	how exactly did you create it ?
2006-07-11T11:53:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	shadowpanda	to test it, go into terminal and type in ./blah.sh
2006-07-11T11:54:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	shadowpanda	it runs fine ?
2006-07-11T11:55:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	shadowpanda	same thing happens to mine. Only works once in a while.
2006-07-11T11:55:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	shadowpanda	did you mark the box that says run in terminal ?
2006-07-11T11:56:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	shadowpanda	no idea than. I know that's the same thing mine does, so it might be something with running scripts from terminal automatically
2006-07-11T12:24:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	shadowpanda	how is that ?
2006-07-11T12:25:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	shadowpanda	or you can do chmod a+x
2006-07-11T12:25:00.000Z	[Ex0r] 	shadowpanda	a+x marks them all as execute. +x doesnt
