2012-10-21T11:31:00.000Z	gabkdlly	effigy	hit the super key, also known as the windows key, or click on the Ubuntu logo in the top left hand corner
2012-10-21T11:32:00.000Z	gabkdlly	effigy	the new interface is called Unity http://unity.ubuntu.com/
2012-10-21T11:32:00.000Z	effigy	gabkdlly	i see that, but it's a search... are you supposed to type in the program you want to run? there's no collected organized list?
2012-10-21T11:34:00.000Z	gabkdlly	effigy	There might be a list somewhere that I am not aware of, but the idea is to be able to find and start programs with few keystrokes.
2012-10-21T11:35:00.000Z	effigy	gabkdlly	well, for example i don't know what audio programs are installed... how can i find out to listen to music? i know how to run a few programs from the terminal... but i don't remember everything that's installed.
2012-10-21T11:35:00.000Z	gabkdlly	effigy	So if I want to set up my printer, and I don't know what the program is called that manages that, I start typing 'printer' and within a few key strokes the application that I was looking for pops up
2012-10-21T11:37:00.000Z	gabkdlly	effigy	doing a search for 'music' worked pretty well for me, gave me rhythmbox, and a couple others
2012-10-21T11:37:00.000Z	effigy	gabkdlly	wow, really? okay, i see what you're saying. that's a big leap. i haven't upgraded releases in a few years. do people like this? i think it's crappy.
2012-10-21T11:38:00.000Z	gabkdlly	effigy	some people like it, some don't, but it looks like it is going to stay the default for a while
2012-10-21T11:39:00.000Z	gabkdlly	effigy	gnome-shell serves a similar purpose, which I hear is now the default in Gnome 3 and up
2012-10-21T11:39:00.000Z	effigy	gabkdlly	is there any sort of shortcut i can make to launch programs? this is kinda annoying.
2012-10-21T11:41:00.000Z	gabkdlly	effigy	if you want to keep using unity, you can make the applications that you use often 'sticky' in the menu.  When you have the application started, right click on its icon on the left of your screen, and choose "Lock to launcher"
2012-10-21T11:42:00.000Z	effigy	gabkdlly	that's the best i can do? can i at least make folders on the launcher? i can't believe there has been such a drastic change.
2012-10-21T11:45:00.000Z	gabkdlly	effigy	there are some other desktops available if this is a dealbreaker for you. Off the top of my head: xubuntu-desktop, lubuntu-desktop, kubuntu-desktop
2012-10-21T11:46:00.000Z	gabkdlly	effigy	I gotta split, best of luck to you, bye
2012-10-21T11:46:00.000Z	effigy	gabkdlly	yeah i'm probably going to switch distros, but thanks... before you go recommend a new distro!
2012-10-21T11:49:00.000Z	gabkdlly	effigy	all packages I just listed are full blown Ubuntu derivatives/siblings, so a lot of what you already know about Ubuntu will transfer, plus since they are in the repos you can switch back and forth without having to reinstall
2012-10-21T11:50:00.000Z	gabkdlly	effigy	If I had to switch right know, I would probably go with xubuntu, I have used it before and like it pretty well
2012-10-21T11:51:00.000Z	effigy	gabkdlly	i know you said you're leaving so feel free to go... but how are you guys dealing with this new structure? there's no program list and you're expected to basically google your computer for applications?
2012-10-21T11:51:00.000Z	gabkdlly	effigy	some people really like Linux Mint, but I know very little about it. It is also an Ubuntu derivative, comes in several flavors, I am unsure what they ended up doing with/without Unity
2012-10-21T11:53:00.000Z	gabkdlly	effigy	I find Unity makes me less dependent on my mouse, which for me is a really good thing since I suffer a little from repetitive strain, and I much prefer my ergonomic keyboard to my mouse
2012-10-21T11:54:00.000Z	gabkdlly	effigy	over and out
