2008-10-25T14:48:00.000Z	Ziggyzxxyl		switched the computer and printer off and it still says "processing" .. the printer is totally lifeless and the activity light on the printer is not flashing or anything
2008-10-25T14:48:00.000Z	Ziggyzxxyl		it was working a couple of days ago
2008-10-25T14:48:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Ziggyzxxyl	if you switched both off, what says processing?
2008-10-25T14:49:00.000Z	Ziggyzxxyl	outbackwifi	under system > admin > Printers and printer status
2008-10-25T14:50:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Ziggyzxxyl	on another PC which was still on when these two were switched off?
2008-10-25T14:51:00.000Z	Ziggyzxxyl	outbackwifi	I restarted the computer and the printer after I switched both off.
2008-10-25T14:51:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Ziggyzxxyl	oh ok, you had me there for a moment
2008-10-25T14:54:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Ziggyzxxyl	is it setup correctly? is CUPS working? what errors does the cups log give
2008-10-25T14:55:00.000Z	Ziggyzxxyl	outbackwifi	I can't remember how to get to CUPS log or browser page
2008-10-25T14:55:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Ziggyzxxyl	/var/log/cups/error_log
2008-10-25T14:58:00.000Z	Ziggyzxxyl	outbackwifi	it won't let me open the error log.
2008-10-25T14:59:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Ziggyzxxyl	do a sudo tail -f /var/log/cups/error_log in a terminal while you try to print
2008-10-25T15:00:00.000Z	Ziggyzxxyl	outbackwifi	also in the CUPS browser control panel page it is asking me for a username/password for everything...
2008-10-25T15:02:00.000Z	Ziggyzxxyl	outbackwifi	here is the tail stub of my error log - http://paste.ubuntu.com/62433/
2008-10-25T15:04:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Ziggyzxxyl	that looks bad; what did you do just before everything stopped working?
2008-10-25T15:05:00.000Z	Ziggyzxxyl	outbackwifi	ok - I worked out the CUPS browser control panel wants my root password. I cleared the funky print job from the queue and the printer sprang back to life... I just tried to print a 300dpi 210mmx297mm image - that is what choked it.
2008-10-25T15:06:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Ziggyzxxyl	is everything hunky dory now?
2008-10-25T15:06:00.000Z	Ziggyzxxyl	outbackwifi	I think so... a test page printed.
2008-10-25T15:06:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Ziggyzxxyl	good
