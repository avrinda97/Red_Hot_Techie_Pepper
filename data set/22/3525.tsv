2008-12-17T16:51:00.000Z	joaopinto	whitedox	what are you trying to achieve ?
2008-12-17T16:51:00.000Z	whitedox	joaopinto	I need to make a thumbnail sheet.
2008-12-17T16:52:00.000Z	joaopinto	whitedox	what the expected output, a big picture with thumbnails from small pictures ?
2008-12-17T16:52:00.000Z	joaopinto		erm, small pictures with the thumbnails...
2008-12-17T16:52:00.000Z	whitedox	joaopinto	yes
2008-12-17T16:53:00.000Z	joaopinto	whitedox	that will required scripting knowledge, as for the imagemagick help, on the terminal just type: man convert
2008-12-17T16:54:00.000Z	whitedox	joaopinto	surely I just neeede a simple script. And there is enough of these thumnail sheets around that there must be something publicly available?
2008-12-17T16:54:00.000Z	joaopinto	whitedox	for html based thumbnails generation there are some tools on the repositories
2008-12-17T16:54:00.000Z	joaopinto	whitedox	thumbnailling with html yes, there are several tools for that
2008-12-17T16:55:00.000Z	whitedox	joaopinto	I really need them to be in jpeg though for release xd
2008-12-17T16:55:00.000Z	joaopinto	whitedox	on the package manager, search for "thumbnail"
2008-12-17T16:55:00.000Z	joaopinto	whitedox	well, so you will need to use imagemagick, and build yourself :P
2008-12-17T16:55:00.000Z	joaopinto	whitedox	or google.com, maybe someone did it
2008-12-17T16:56:00.000Z	whitedox	joaopinto	exactly. But I have no clue how to use it
2008-12-17T16:56:00.000Z	joaopinto	whitedox	did you read it's manpage already ?
2008-12-17T16:56:00.000Z	whitedox	joaopinto	no -_-. But from what I have gathered, it is a command line only tool with no gui.
2008-12-17T16:57:00.000Z	joaopinto	whitedox	right, so you just need to learn how to use it from the command line, there are plenty of examples on the documentation, you just need to copy them and adapt
2008-12-17T16:58:00.000Z	joaopinto	whitedox	it is something like, convert image.in -size(thumbnail_dimension) image.out
2008-12-17T16:58:00.000Z	whitedox	joaopinto	is there any unofficial plugin that adds a gui?  lol I hate command line stuff for advanced stuff that uses dimensions and more then one filename  -_-
2008-12-17T16:59:00.000Z	joaopinto	whitedox	not that I am aware off, there is an menu applet which provides the "resize" function on nautilus
2008-12-17T16:59:00.000Z	joaopinto		that would allow to create the thumbnails, but not to merge them on a single image
2008-12-17T17:00:00.000Z	whitedox	joaopinto	is there any alternate program that can merge the images? lol
