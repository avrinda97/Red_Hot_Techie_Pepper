2008-06-29T03:47:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		Blaqlight; you would need to have ssh running in order to do that. once you get ssh up you are fine.
2008-06-29T03:49:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		Blaqlight; actually, headless.. i'm not sure you can install while it being headless.
2008-06-29T03:50:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	so without a keyboard is fine, but without a monitor would be a problem?
2008-07-28T07:51:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	df -h
2008-08-01T03:19:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	read the site that factoid suggests, it all makes sense, I know because I had to read it also :P
2008-08-01T03:19:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	yes we all do
2008-08-01T03:20:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	its a virtual filesystem kinda, its not using any space.
2008-08-01T03:21:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	just make sure your part of the fuse group or you can't mount cdroms...
2008-08-01T03:21:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	among others...
2008-08-01T03:22:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	if your not part of the 'fuse' group you can't mount cdroms unless your root :P
2008-08-01T03:23:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	I assume it allows common users to read/write removable media/filesystems without being sudo.
2008-08-01T03:25:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	after an upgrade I was removed from that group and I had to be sudo to mount/read/write/ cdroms
2008-08-01T03:26:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	once added back I had no problems, also the drive would show on the desktop only when I mounted it being a part of the fuse group.
2008-08-01T03:30:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	only the latest and greatest :D
2008-08-05T08:17:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	that too.
2008-08-05T08:25:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	yes I found that out too.
2008-08-08T07:29:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	thats a bad idea, it will make all of the files owned by root, its more work than its worth. lol
2008-08-08T07:31:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	your sounding like george bush with "the google" lol
2008-08-08T07:33:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	maybe my memory is shot. no need to be mean
2008-08-09T05:18:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	ubuntu can support RPM's
2008-08-14T22:28:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	it really doesn't bother me anymore... on top of that, bad things happen to me when I mess with my filesystem...
2008-08-14T22:31:00.000Z	Blaqlight	bastid_raZor	wait a minute, / is on the partition, /home is within that, how can it be that easy...
