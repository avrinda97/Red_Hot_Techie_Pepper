2006-10-31T17:14:00.000Z	leofender		could somebody tell me what's the partition software for kde?
2006-10-31T17:15:00.000Z	leofender		ahh yes
2006-10-31T17:15:00.000Z	leofender		just like MS DOShaha
2006-10-31T17:15:00.000Z	leofender		thank you
2006-10-31T17:16:00.000Z	leofender		linux itself is a lot more powerfull
2006-10-31T17:18:00.000Z	leofender		I'll try with fdisk
2006-10-31T17:18:00.000Z	leofender		ahh
2006-10-31T17:18:00.000Z	leofender		I've got to compile a C program, but I have to compile it using borlan for windows
2006-10-31T17:18:00.000Z	LjL	leofender	why?
2006-10-31T17:20:00.000Z	LjL	leofender	no you can't, because "CONIO.H" is not a standard ANSI C header, and it's basically only supported under MS-DOS for all i know
2006-10-31T17:25:00.000Z	LjL	leofender	by doing it?
2006-10-31T17:20:00.000Z	LjL	leofender	you don't, you use different functions
2006-10-31T17:21:00.000Z	LjL	leofender	no they won't
2006-10-31T17:22:00.000Z	LjL	leofender	have a look at here http://www.ozzu.com/ftopic32782.html    there appears to be a conio -> ncurses wrapper (lupine_85 too, FYI)
2006-10-31T17:23:00.000Z	LjL	leofender	though it gives me a 404. but search for "linux-conio-1.02.tgz" on google, finds a few
2006-10-31T17:23:00.000Z	LjL	leofender	or search for "linux-conio" even
2006-10-31T17:23:00.000Z	LjL	leofender	either.
2006-10-31T17:25:00.000Z	LjL	leofender	YES you can
2006-10-31T17:25:00.000Z	LjL	leofender	just about every program for Gnome is written in C
2006-10-31T17:26:00.000Z	LjL	leofender	perhaps http://tronche.com/gui/x/
