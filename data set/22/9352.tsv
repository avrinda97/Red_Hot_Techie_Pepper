2005-01-23T15:03:00.000Z	madsen	Unholyfuneral	Well, there are some stuff you can do, like changing the init-system and such. (Can't remember details though.)
2005-01-23T15:12:00.000Z	madsen	Unholyfuneral	Good for what?
2005-01-23T15:13:00.000Z	madsen	Unholyfuneral	Knopix should be good...

2005-01-23T15:13:00.000Z	madsen	Unholyfuneral	Well, most of them _should_ work right and I think Ubuntu will too, if you just use it right...

2005-01-23T15:14:00.000Z	madsen	Unholyfuneral	And wtf are you trying to run it on? A toaster?

2005-01-23T15:17:00.000Z	madsen	Unholyfuneral	Any clue as to why it doesn't start x by itself?
2005-01-23T15:17:00.000Z	madsen	Unholyfuneral	Well, that doesn't really say very much about the hardware... Any untypical hardware?
2005-01-23T15:20:00.000Z	madsen	Unholyfuneral	You just insert the cd, boot with the defaults?
2005-01-23T15:20:00.000Z	madsen	Unholyfuneral	Or what?
2005-01-23T15:20:00.000Z	madsen	Unholyfuneral	Well, have you tried any alternative settings?
