2005-09-08T16:52:00.000Z	h17m4n		quick question: when you do the "make" "make install" commands for ndiswrapper, is it compiled to run on your architecture(amd64,ppc)?
2005-09-08T16:53:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	Yes, so you will ALSO need WiNDOWS drivers for that arch.
2005-09-08T16:53:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	So ppc would be useless, as is amd64 in most cases.
2005-09-08T05:03:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	the amd64
2005-09-08T16:54:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	if there are 64bit ones
2005-09-08T05:01:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	They'll make typos.
2005-09-08T05:03:00.000Z	h17m4n	cafuego	which feels faster, the ppc or amd64?
2005-09-08T05:04:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	then ia32, sure.
2005-09-08T08:12:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	probably with blackdown (which is sun) but not with the gcc one
2005-09-11T06:51:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	go and rerad the chroot url ubotu just posted.
2005-09-14T08:42:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	In a chroot.
2005-09-14T08:42:00.000Z	h17m4n	cafuego	thx man... so I should run dchroot -d before starting right?
2005-09-14T08:43:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	You can run dchroot -q -d /path/to/wine "C:\\\Program Files\\\Appdir\\\App.exe"
2005-09-14T08:43:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	Note the triple backslash.
2005-09-14T08:44:00.000Z	h17m4n	cafuego	but that's after I install wine in chroot right?
2005-09-14T08:45:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	indeed
2005-09-14T08:45:00.000Z	h17m4n	cafuego	thx! now let me get to work :)
2005-09-14T10:46:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	sudo apt-get install wine
2005-09-14T10:47:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	ubunbtuforms should not be used, as they give you bad info.
2005-09-14T10:47:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	Pretty much, installing unpackged software is  abad idea.
2005-09-14T10:48:00.000Z	h17m4n	cafuego	so doing a 'sudo apt-get wine' on chroot will get all of that done?
2005-09-14T10:49:00.000Z	cafuego	h17m4n	that will install wine, yes.
