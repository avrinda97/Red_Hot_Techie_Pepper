2006-05-03T12:31:00.000Z	shizzz		let me see if its the filesytem or partition
2006-05-03T12:33:00.000Z	shizzz		a busy device is a device with at least one mounted partition. Becuase making changes to a busy device may confuse the kernel, you are advised to rebot your computer
2006-05-03T12:34:00.000Z	shizzz		sunds sorta like a generic msg
2006-05-03T10:46:00.000Z	shizzz		has anyone built any apps that run on ubuntu?
2006-05-03T10:47:00.000Z	shizzz		if so i have a couplr basic questions
2006-05-03T10:48:00.000Z	shizzz		well my first question is about the synaptic manager. its build on the debian specs right? not the red hat pakage installer.
2006-05-03T10:49:00.000Z	shizzz		so if i want to downlload a package it must be a debian package. or can the synaptic manager download various kinds of packages
2006-05-03T10:50:00.000Z	eck	shizzz	you should be downloading .deb packages.  it may be possible to convert a .rpm to a .deb with a tool like alien
2006-05-03T10:52:00.000Z	eck	shizzz	you will be using the GCC compiler.  You can use whatever IDE you want, but most people seem to use vim or emacs
2006-05-03T10:53:00.000Z	eck	shizzz	as gnomefreak said, install build-essential
2006-05-03T11:34:00.000Z	eck	shizzz	the vim operations are mostly the same, but with more features and less quirks
2006-05-03T11:35:00.000Z	eck	shizzz	as gnomefreak said, vim comes with ubuntu
2006-05-03T11:35:00.000Z	eck	shizzz	it's part of the base install
2006-05-03T11:36:00.000Z	shizzz	eck	do you know what version?
2006-05-03T11:36:00.000Z	eck	shizzz	apt-cache show vim will tell you.  on my computer running dapper the version is 6.4-006+2ubuntu3
2006-05-03T11:45:00.000Z	eck	shizzz	you need to enable some of those things in your .vimrc
2006-05-03T11:46:00.000Z	eck	shizzz	you might want to try using vim-gnome or vim-gtk
2006-05-03T11:46:00.000Z	eck	shizzz	that way you can turn on and off features through a gui
2006-05-03T12:45:00.000Z	eck	shizzz	do a google search for autoconf
