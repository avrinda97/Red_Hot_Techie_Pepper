2009-06-26T05:09:00.000Z	Aacron		hey quick question... I edited fstab to mount my backup drive but its not showing up as mounted... is it not automounting it?  thought fstab did that???
2009-06-26T05:10:00.000Z	Ghoti_	Aacron	did you set the 'auto' option?
2009-06-26T05:13:00.000Z	Ghoti_	Aacron	Windows can'tยน read ext3 filesystems.   ยน: without installing drivers that are kinda flaky
2009-06-26T05:14:00.000Z	Ghoti_	Aacron	so I hear/read. I use it for read-only, and it's been stable.  YMMV.
2009-06-26T05:15:00.000Z	Aacron	Ghoti_	 is there a better way to do that then/  cause when it was NTFS linux kept whining about it not being clean (even though windows said it was fine after 3x chkdsk runs)
2009-06-26T05:16:00.000Z	Ghoti_	Aacron	I have no trouble reading NTFS unter Ubuntu. If it gives you that complaint, if you expand the details of the message, it gives you a command to force it to mount.  I only get that error after an unclean shutdown
2009-06-26T05:16:00.000Z	Aacron	Ghoti_	 so is linux's (relatively new) ntfs plugin more stable than windows ext2/3?
2009-06-26T05:17:00.000Z	Ghoti_	Aacron	from what I've read, yes.  I've had no problems personally with either.
2009-06-26T05:19:00.000Z	Aacron	Ghoti_	 hopefully I have that installed.
2009-06-26T05:20:00.000Z	Ghoti_	Aacron	I don't have a mkntfs or mkfs.ntfs on my system; you could probably get away with blowing out the partition (CAREFULLY!!) in fdisk, creating an NTFS partition in FDISK, and formatting that from Windowsland
2009-06-26T05:20:00.000Z	Ghoti_	Aacron	I just ended up using NAS, personally ;)
2009-06-26T05:21:00.000Z	Aacron	Ghoti_	 eh was goign to try and format in linux since i would be certain it would format it in a way that it can read
2009-06-26T05:21:00.000Z	Ghoti_	Aacron	 network storage :)
2009-06-26T05:21:00.000Z	Aacron	Ghoti_	 what was NAS?  you mean networked storage?
2009-06-26T05:22:00.000Z	Aacron	Ghoti_	 oh... well... that would really kill the games :))
2009-06-26T05:22:00.000Z	Ghoti_	Aacron	depeds on yor LAN, but we're getting far afield of your question :)
2009-06-26T05:23:00.000Z	Aacron	Ghoti_	 so you recommand formattign it with NTFS and not playing with the windows ext2/3 fs plugin...
2009-06-26T05:24:00.000Z	Ghoti_	Aacron	if it's already extfs and you feel comfortable using the Windows extfs plugin, that will work- it's just still experimental as far as I know.  It's worked fine for me, but I didn't use it to write.
2009-06-26T05:26:00.000Z	Aacron	Ghoti_	 hrmm the choices, the choices... i could use a possibly buggy ext2/3 thing on windows, I can use NTFS and not be certain of writes in linux... or I could use FAT, but I think I'd lose performance int he read/writes on the disk then right?
2009-06-26T05:27:00.000Z	Ghoti_	Aacron	indeed, and there are also other limitations to FAT
2009-06-26T05:28:00.000Z	Aacron	Ghoti_	 ugh... so any way i look at it I'm just screwed :))  is there any filesystem type that is natively supported by BOTH OS's that isnt' performance-crippled?
2009-06-26T05:36:00.000Z	Ghoti_	Aacron	I agree with muse
