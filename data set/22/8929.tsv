2005-10-13T05:46:00.000Z	rob^		on boot I'm getting "cannot find volume group "hda2"" it then cuts over to busybox, how can I fix this?
2005-10-13T05:47:00.000Z	rob^		slept no
2005-10-13T05:47:00.000Z	slept	rob^	good
2005-10-13T05:47:00.000Z	rob^		just bought a new laptop, root is /dev/hda2
2005-10-13T05:48:00.000Z	slept		what part is lvm ?
2005-10-13T05:48:00.000Z	rob^		slept none of it, there is just two partitions and a swap
2005-10-13T05:49:00.000Z	slept	rob^	volumegroups are part of lvm , if you don't have any than you can skip it with CTRL+C
2005-10-13T05:50:00.000Z	rob^	slept	the problem is that on boot its dropping me into a busybox shell
2005-10-13T05:50:00.000Z	slept	rob^	whats a busybox shell ?
2005-10-13T05:51:00.000Z	rob^	slept	busybox is a low resource requirement environment, in the kernel itself
2005-10-13T05:52:00.000Z	rob^		ffs dont paste
2005-10-13T05:55:00.000Z	slept	rob^	there is a kernel module  beeing a shell, never heard of that before, how far does it boot till you get to busybox ?
2005-10-13T05:55:00.000Z	rob^	slept	its pretty much at the start
2005-10-13T05:55:00.000Z	rob^		just after grub hands control over to the kernel
2005-10-13T05:56:00.000Z	slept	rob^	apt-told me busbox comes into play when you screwd up your system , what did you do before getting to busybox?
2005-10-13T05:57:00.000Z	rob^	slept	just finished an install
2005-10-13T05:57:00.000Z	slept	rob^	:-(
2005-10-13T05:58:00.000Z	rob^		slept I even tried letting it auto partition incase I stuffed something the first time, same problem
2005-10-13T05:59:00.000Z	slept	rob^	did you try a live cd to make sure your hardware is supported ?
2005-10-13T06:00:00.000Z	rob^		slept it is, suse and freebsd run fine on it
2005-10-13T06:03:00.000Z	rob^		dont do that Oetzi
2005-10-13T06:03:00.000Z	slept	rob^	thats strange , I think you have to have a very close look on the boot process , to find out what the last thing is that is done  correctly
