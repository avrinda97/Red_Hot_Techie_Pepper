2012-02-17T02:53:00.000Z	zuhaitz		Hi, I installed Windows 7 and I gave 100 gB for Linux Ubuntu installation, but now I just boot Linux Ubuntu and when I am going to make the partition it only show me the entire HD without the NTFS and free partitions, why? help please
2012-02-17T02:54:00.000Z	DexterF	zuhaitz	how big is the disk?
2012-02-17T02:56:00.000Z	DexterF	zuhaitz	maybe boot live cd and run gpart frorm a console, see if ubuntu sees partitions at all
2012-02-17T02:57:00.000Z	DexterF	zuhaitz	gpart scans disks for partitions. that win7 isnt encrypted?
2012-02-17T03:01:00.000Z	DexterF	zuhaitz	nuh-uh! gpart! not gparted. well, actually, gparted is worth a shot, too, come to think of it
2012-02-17T03:02:00.000Z	DexterF	zuhaitz	sound like the partition table is somewhat odd.. or the disk layout. but 300gb, thats a laptop disk, no ssd, right?
2012-02-17T03:02:00.000Z	zuhaitz	DexterF	is a PC
2012-02-17T03:03:00.000Z	DexterF	zuhaitz	with 300gb disk? raided a antique store? ;)
2012-02-17T03:07:00.000Z	DexterF	zuhaitz	tough luck. fscking with the part table will make win7 unhappy, my guess
2012-02-17T03:07:00.000Z	zuhaitz	DexterF	I did the partitions with Windpws 7 installation DVD, so I dont understand why happen this, Windows 7 boots OK
2012-02-17T03:07:00.000Z	zuhaitz	DexterF	What can I do
2012-02-17T03:07:00.000Z	zuhaitz	DexterF	Why happened this?
2012-02-17T03:08:00.000Z	DexterF	zuhaitz	weeeeell: before you mess with the table, back it up: grab a usb stick, do:   dd if=/dev/sda of=/path(to/stick/mbr.backup bs=512 count=1
2012-02-17T03:08:00.000Z	zuhaitz	DexterF	I dont want to do anything
2012-02-17T03:09:00.000Z	DexterF	zuhaitz	then try and repair it, install linux, then see if you're lucky and grub boots that win7 or if ms is smart enough meanwhile to handle resintalling botched boot loaders. whcih I doubt, since they are a dork company.
2012-02-17T03:10:00.000Z	zuhaitz	DexterF	But I cant install linux
2012-02-17T03:10:00.000Z	DexterF	zuhaitz	well, backup mbr from live cd and then fix it from live cd, too. then when the table is readable to linux, install linux
2012-02-17T03:11:00.000Z	zuhaitz	DexterF	any manual for mbr fix?
2012-02-17T03:11:00.000Z	DexterF	zuhaitz	journalist? get a macbook ;)
2012-02-17T03:11:00.000Z	zuhaitz	DexterF	I dont want to use any apple software any more
2012-02-17T03:16:00.000Z	DexterF	zuhaitz	outta ideas. I'd try and run google with "gpt win7" or so. my win7 here was ok, same procedure, then again, who knows, maybe I saw sth and overrode it. (overrode? sounds odd)
2012-02-17T03:19:00.000Z	DexterF	zuhaitz	cfhowlett seems to knwo thing and I need to run. godspeed :D
